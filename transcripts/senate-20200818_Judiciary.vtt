EVICTIONS. THIS WILL BE

00:24:12.684 --> 00:24:14.252
CATASTROPHIC FOR TENANTS.

00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:21.326
THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:22.794
MANY TENANTS HAVE BEEN UNABLE

00:24:22.861 --> 00:24:25.497
TO PAY THE RENT. RENTERS HAVE

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:27.332

LOSE THEIR HOME AT A TIME WHEN

COVERED CASES ARE STILL

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:43.448
DANGEROUSLY HIGH. I THINK EVERY

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:45.550
MEMBER OF OUR LEGISLATURE

00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:46.184
UNDERSTANDS HOW UNFAIR THIS HAS

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:49.487
BEEN. GOVERNMENT ORDER PEOPLE

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:50.088

HOPEFULLY THE WORST OF THE

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.537
PANDEMIC HAS PASSED. BUT I KNOW

00:25:39.604 --> 00:25:41.673
THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.575
FULL EVENTUAL REPAYMENT OF ALL

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:45.877

ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE IF WE

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.120
DON'T CHANGE STATE LAW TENANTS

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:57.789

00:25:57.856 --> 00:25:58.390
WILL NEVER GET THE MONIES THAT

00:25:58.456 --> 00:26:00.792

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:03.094
SAYS TENANTS SHOULD BE SHOULD

00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:04.930
NOT BE AFFECTED. FOR NOT BEING

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:07.165
ABLE TO PAY THE RENT DURING.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.234
OUR COVERT STATE OF EMERGENCY.

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:10.335
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME TIME

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:11.803
TO EVENTUALLY PAY THE BACK RENT

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.406

ME STRESS OUR BILL DOES NOT

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.983
CANCEL RENT OR RELIEF TENANTS

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.885
OF THEIR OBLIGATION TO PAY.

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:29.754
INSTEAD TO GIVE TENANTS A BREAK

00:26:29.821 --> 00:26:33.558

CALIFORNIA ON OUR WATCH. THE

HUMAN SUFFERING WOULD BE

00:26:53.178 --> 00:26:55.180
EXTRAORDINARY. IT WOULD LEAD TO

ENORMOUS INCREASES IN

A ONCE IN A GENERATION.

THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN. TO DATE TO

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.712
DECISIVE ACTION IS NEEDED TO-

THE FOLLOWING CATASTROPHE OF

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:28.252
THE POTENTIAL OF MASS

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:30.488
EVICTIONS. WE ALSO NEED TO

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:32.123
ENSURE AS WE JUST HEARD FROM A

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:32.890
PREVIOUS WITNESS THAT WE

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:35.092
PROTECT SMALL LANDLORDS WE KNOW

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:37.695
THAT THIS IS A CRISIS FOR. ALL

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:40.531
SECTORS. BERMAN BUT ONE

00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:42.567
CRITICAL PIECE OF THE POLICY TO

00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:44.468
SOLVE THAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:46.437
AN ESSENTIAL POLICY OF THIS AS

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:47.204
AS BOTH AUTHORS HAVE TALKED

00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:48.973
ABOUT. IS THAT WE SHOULD NOT

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.842
PUNISH TENANTS. SIMPLY BECAUSE

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:53.210
THROUGH ADDICTION FOR SOMETHING

00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:54.745
THAT WAS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:56.480
THE STATE HOME THEY DIDN'T GO

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:58.482
TO WORK WE ASK THEM TO DO THAT

00:36:58.549 --> 00:37:00.017
THEY'VE DONE THAT AND NOW WE

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:02.053
NEED TO PROTECT THEM. FROM

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:03.688
EVICTION. BUT ONE CONSERVATIVE

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:05.189
ESTIMATE IS THAT THIS HAS

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:07.858
IMPACTED FOUR POINT ONE MILLION

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:10.528

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:11.796
HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA MAYBE

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:15.099
AS MUCH AS 42% OR MORE WE DON'T

00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:16.701
KNOW BUT WE KNOW. THAT THOSE

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:20.805
FOLKS FACE A CLIFF IF WE DO NOT

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.974
ACT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.809
ADJOURNS AND ONE WAY IN WHICH

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:27.244
WE CAN ACT IS TO ENSURE THAT WE

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:28.346
PROTECT THEM FROM THE VENTURA

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:29.947
TAKING AFFECTION OFF THE TABLE

00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:31.649
BUT AS MR CHIU HAS SAID THAT WE

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:34.952

03:24:05.566 --> 03:24:07.868
ROOM WE ARE EXPERIENCING

03:24:07.935 --> 03:24:11.105
ECONOMIC AND A HEALTH CRISIS-

03:24:11.172 --> 03:24:13.240
THE A PANDEMIC THAT WE HAVEN'T

03:24:13.307 --> 03:24:15.343
HAD A HUNDRED YEARS WHICH IS

03:24:15.409 --> 03:24:18.079
OLDER THAN I. AND THESE CALLS

03:24:18.145 --> 03:24:19.547
FOR HELP OUR REAL THEIR

03:24:19.614 --> 03:24:21.282
IMMEDIATE THEY ARE JUSTIFIABLE

03:24:21.349 --> 03:24:23.050
WE CAN'T IGNORE THEM. THE

03:24:23.117 --> 03:24:24.652
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THOSE

03:24:24.719 --> 03:24:25.953
COMING UP SHORT IN THEIR

03:24:26.020 --> 03:24:27.755
EFFORTS TO PAY RENT RIGHT NOW

03:24:27.822 --> 03:24:29.557
ARE COMING UP SHORT THROUGH NO

03:24:29.624 --> 03:24:33.127
FAULT OF THEIR OWN. AND WE HAVE

03:24:33.194 --> 03:24:35.062
A DUTY TO HELP. WITH EACH

03:24:35.129 --> 03:24:36.964
PROPOSAL FOR TENET RELIEF WE'VE

03:24:37.031 --> 03:24:38.466
HEARD HOWEVER WE'VE ALSO HEARD

03:24:38.532 --> 03:24:40.201
AN UNDERSTANDABLE RETORT FROM

03:24:40.267 --> 03:24:41.969
LANDLORDS WHAT ABOUT US WHAT

03:24:42.036 --> 03:24:44.238
ABOUT ME. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED

03:24:44.305 --> 03:24:45.106
TO DO WE DON'T WANT TO KICK

03:24:45.172 --> 03:24:47.108
TENANTS OUT BUT WITHOUT RENT

03:24:47.174 --> 03:24:48.376
PAYMENTS WE CANNOT PAY

03:24:48.442 --> 03:24:50.077
MORTGAGES OR TAXES OR

03:24:50.144 --> 03:24:52.279
MAINTENANCE AND- OTHER KINDS OF

03:24:52.346 --> 03:24:55.349
THINGS UPON WHICH WE DEPEND. ON

03:24:55.416 --> 03:24:58.419
THAT RENTAL INCOME FOR AS WELL.

03:24:58.486 --> 03:24:59.887
WE HEARD IT AGAIN TODAY AND

03:24:59.954 --> 03:25:00.354
WE'VE BEEN HEARING IT

03:25:00.421 --> 03:25:02.490
THROUGHOUT. IT IS CLEARLY A

03:25:02.556 --> 03:25:06.227
LEGITIMATE CONCERN SO I GREATLY

03:25:06.293 --> 03:25:07.294
WELCOME AND SUPPORT THE

03:25:07.361 --> 03:25:09.897
OPPORTUNITY. TWO APPROACHES

03:25:09.964 --> 03:25:12.633
BILL WHICH I BELIEVE IS MORE

03:25:12.700 --> 03:25:14.669
BALANCED IT GIVES TENANTS TO

03:25:14.735 --> 03:25:16.504
BREAK IF THEY NEEDED IN A GIVE

03:25:16.570 --> 03:25:18.806
SMALL LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS

03:25:18.873 --> 03:25:20.307
A BREAK IF THEY NEED IT AND I

03:25:20.374 --> 03:25:21.642
THINK WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR

03:25:21.709 --> 03:25:23.544
BECAUSE I THINK THE MANY OF

03:25:23.611 --> 03:25:25.913
THOSE WHO WERE A TESTIFYING IN

03:25:25.980 --> 03:25:27.848
OPPOSITION DID NOT REALIZE THAT

03:25:27.915 --> 03:25:30.184
THIS BILL INCLUDES BOTH THE

03:25:30.251 --> 03:25:32.620
TENANT. AND THE LANDLORD THE

03:25:32.687 --> 03:25:33.854
SMALLER LANDLORDS WE'VE HEARD A

03:25:33.921 --> 03:25:35.790
LOT OF THEM TESTIFIED TODAY SO

03:25:35.856 --> 03:25:37.758
I WOULD ASK THAT THOSE WHO ARE

03:25:37.825 --> 03:25:39.293
STILL LISTENING WHO WERE IN

03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:40.861
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BECAUSE

03:25:40.928 --> 03:25:41.696
THEY DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANY

03:25:41.762 --> 03:25:43.397
HELP FOR THE LOOK FOR LANDLORDS

03:25:43.464 --> 03:25:45.533
SUPPORT FOR HOMEOWNERS PLEASE

03:25:45.599 --> 03:25:48.402
LISTEN CAREFULLY IT IS INDEED

03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:50.938
INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. AND OF

03:25:51.005 --> 03:25:52.740
COURSE NOT SURPRISINGLY THE

03:25:52.807 --> 03:25:54.308
NEXT LINK UP IN THE FINANCIAL

03:25:54.375 --> 03:25:55.843
CHAIN WHICH IS BANKS AND

03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:58.112
LENDERS NOW RAISE THEIR VOICE

03:25:58.179 --> 03:26:00.581
TO SAY DON'T MAKE US BEAR THE

03:26:00.648 --> 03:26:01.415
BURDEN OF HAVING TO WAIT TO GET

03:26:01.482 --> 03:26:03.784
PAID BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH THAT

03:26:03.851 --> 03:26:05.352
WE ALL I THINK HAVE TO CONFRONT

03:26:05.419 --> 03:26:06.654
NONE OF THIS WANTED THE

03:26:06.721 --> 03:26:09.056
SITUATION. NONE OF US ARE HAPPY

03:26:09.123 --> 03:26:11.392
WITH THE SITUATION BUT ALL OF

03:26:11.459 --> 03:26:13.594
US ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BEAR

03:26:13.661 --> 03:26:17.631
SOME PART OF THE BURDEN

03:26:17.698 --> 03:26:18.299
OTHERWISE WHAT'S GOING TO

03:26:18.365 --> 03:26:19.667
HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO SEE

03:26:19.734 --> 03:26:23.204
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

03:26:23.270 --> 03:26:23.771
PEOPLE OUT IN THE STREET. WE

03:26:23.838 --> 03:26:25.673
ARE GOING TO SEE. HOMEOWNER AND

03:26:25.740 --> 03:26:28.976
SMALL LANDLORDS. FORECLOSED

03:26:29.043 --> 03:26:31.645
UPON. AND WHAT WOULD LIKELY

03:26:31.712 --> 03:26:33.347
HAPPEN THEN IT IS THOSE WHO

03:26:33.414 --> 03:26:35.082
HAVE HAD THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO

03:26:35.149 --> 03:26:37.885
WEATHER THE STORM. COULD VERY

03:26:37.952 --> 03:26:38.319
WELL BY UP ALL THOSE

03:26:38.385 --> 03:26:40.888
PROPERTIES. ENHANCE THEIR OWN

03:26:40.955 --> 03:26:42.823
FINANCIAL WEALTH. TO THE

03:26:42.890 --> 03:26:44.458
DETRIMENT OF THE AVERAGE

03:26:44.525 --> 03:26:46.861
PERSON. THE AVERAGE SMALL

03:26:46.927 --> 03:26:53.801
LANDLORD WHO FINDS THEMSELVES.

03:26:53.868 --> 03:26:55.436
TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING.

03:26:55.503 --> 03:26:57.505
THOSE ARE NOT OUR VALUES. AND

03:26:57.571 --> 03:26:59.540
SO AT THE END OF THE DAY.

03:26:59.607 --> 03:27:01.275
EVERYONE INVOLVED FROM BANKS

03:27:01.342 --> 03:27:05.012
AND LENDERS. ARE AND THOSE WHO

03:27:05.079 --> 03:27:06.213
ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO STEP

03:27:06.280 --> 03:27:08.382
UP. AND ARE IN THE BEST

03:27:08.449 --> 03:27:10.885
POSITION TO DO SO I BELIEVE

03:27:10.951 --> 03:27:13.020
MUCH TO HELP AS WELL. AND IF

03:27:13.087 --> 03:27:14.922
NOTHING ELSE UNLIKE LANDLORDS

03:27:14.989 --> 03:27:16.123
TENANTS AND HOMEOWNERS THE

03:27:16.190 --> 03:27:17.958
BANKS AND LENDERS. ARE SECURED

03:27:18.025 --> 03:27:19.894
CREDITORS. AT THE END OF THE

03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:21.295
DAY THEY'VE GOT THE GREATEST

03:27:21.362 --> 03:27:22.730
ASSURANCE OF GETTING THE FULL

03:27:22.797 --> 03:27:24.465
BENEFIT OF THEIR BARGAIN.

03:27:24.532 --> 03:27:27.568
THEY'VE GOT THE PROPERTY. AS

03:27:27.635 --> 03:27:31.071
THEIR ASSURANCE. I RECOGNIZE

03:27:31.138 --> 03:27:32.573
THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS

03:27:32.640 --> 03:27:33.741
ABOUT THE LIMITS OF STATE

03:27:33.808 --> 03:27:34.809
AUTHORITY TO MANDATE

03:27:34.875 --> 03:27:36.143
FORBEARANCE AND IT WAS

03:27:36.210 --> 03:27:37.278
DISCUSSED AT LENGTH IN THIS

03:27:37.344 --> 03:27:39.647
BILL WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

03:27:39.713 --> 03:27:42.316
ARE INDEED SOME OF PREEMPTION

03:27:42.383 --> 03:27:45.019
ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED- THERE

03:27:45.085 --> 03:27:48.189
ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

03:27:48.255 --> 03:27:50.024
FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS- AND

03:27:50.090 --> 03:27:51.258
WITH RESPECT TO FEDERALLY

03:27:51.325 --> 03:27:54.662
CHARTERED BANKS SO WE HAVE

03:27:54.728 --> 03:27:57.765
ENGAGED MYSELF AND MY STAFF IN

03:27:57.832 --> 03:27:59.633
VERY FRANK CONVERSATIONS WITH

03:27:59.700 --> 03:28:01.702
THE AUTHORS ABOUT THOSE

03:28:01.769 --> 03:28:03.771
CONCERNS AND- BY MERGING THE

03:28:03.838 --> 03:28:05.773
AUTHOR. OF THE AUTHORS TO

03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:07.107
CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO

03:28:07.174 --> 03:28:09.476
MAKE SURE THIS BILL IS ON THE

03:28:09.543 --> 03:28:11.245
STRONGEST POSSIBLE LEGAL

03:28:11.312 --> 03:28:13.180
FOOTING. IT WOULD BE MY HOPE

03:28:13.247 --> 03:28:15.282
THAT THE BANKS AND THE LENDERS

03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:17.451
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO SOME FOR

03:28:17.518 --> 03:28:19.286
PARENTS BE WILLING TO BE PART

03:28:19.353 --> 03:28:22.523
OF THIS DISCUSSION RATHER THAN

03:28:22.590 --> 03:28:23.290
POTENTIALLY RUN INTO THE COURTS

03:28:23.357 --> 03:28:24.792
ARE- ASSERTING FEDERAL

03:28:24.859 --> 03:28:26.627
PREEMPTION ISSUES AND FRANKLY

03:28:26.694 --> 03:28:28.028
PART OF THIS DISCUSSION IS

03:28:28.095 --> 03:28:29.396
WE'VE TRIED TO CREATE SOME

03:28:29.463 --> 03:28:31.866
PARALLELS. SO THAT WHAT WAS

03:28:31.932 --> 03:28:33.634
DONE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH

03:28:33.701 --> 03:28:36.971
THE CARERS ACT WILL BE

03:28:37.037 --> 03:28:40.307
AVAILABLE- OVERALL TO OTHERS

03:28:40.374 --> 03:28:43.110
BUT- THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK

03:28:43.177 --> 03:28:45.446
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT BILL

03:28:45.512 --> 03:28:47.781
IT'S OF. DIFFICULT SITUATION-

03:28:47.848 --> 03:28:49.183
BUT THE THIS BILL AND IT'S

03:28:49.250 --> 03:28:51.485
CONCEPTS HAVE TO BE PART OF THE

03:28:51.552 --> 03:28:53.020
CONVERSATION AND PART OF THE

03:28:53.087 --> 03:28:55.389
SOLUTION SO. I AM PLEASED TO

03:28:55.456 --> 03:28:59.226
SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I DON'T

03:28:59.293 --> 03:28:59.727
USUALLY IT'S NOT BEEN MY

03:28:59.793 --> 03:29:00.761
PRACTICE TO. SUPPORT A BILL

03:29:00.828 --> 03:29:02.496
PRIOR TO OUR HEARING BUT WHEN

03:29:02.563 --> 03:29:04.365
IT COMES TO THIS. PIECE OF

03:29:04.431 --> 03:29:06.800
LEGISLATION AS WAS NOTED. IN

03:29:06.867 --> 03:29:09.904
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE OPENING

03:29:09.970 --> 03:29:12.506
I AM HONORED TO BE. ADDED AS A

03:29:12.573 --> 03:29:14.208
CO AUTHOR AND AS THE PRINCIPLE

03:29:14.275 --> 03:29:15.509
COOPER FROM THE SENATE HAVING

03:29:15.576 --> 03:29:17.578
WORKED FOR HEART IN THIS BILL I

03:29:17.645 --> 03:29:19.713
KNOW IT FAIRLY WELL- WE NEED TO

03:29:19.780 --> 03:29:22.049
CONFRONT A POTENTIAL WAVE OF

03:29:22.116 --> 03:29:23.984
EVICTIONS AND FORECLOSURES ON

03:29:24.051 --> 03:29:26.654
AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. AND

03:29:26.720 --> 03:29:30.457
DOING NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION.

03:29:30.524 --> 03:29:33.193
CAN WE CLOSE. HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

03:29:33.260 --> 03:29:37.731
THAT SO- THE- TO THE LANDLORDS

03:29:37.798 --> 03:29:39.099
OPPOSING THE BILL BECAUSE

03:29:39.166 --> 03:29:40.734
YOU'VE NOT GOTTEN RENT FOR

03:29:40.801 --> 03:29:42.803
SEVERAL MONTHS WE HEAR YOU EVEN

03:29:42.870 --> 03:29:45.506
IF I DID CUT YOU OFF ABSOLUTELY

03:29:45.572 --> 03:29:46.674
IT'S A PROBLEM AND THERE ARE

03:29:46.740 --> 03:29:48.475
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT GOTTEN RENT

03:29:48.542 --> 03:29:51.011
WHICH THEY NEED TO MAKE THEIR

03:29:51.078 --> 03:29:51.578
PAYMENTS AND TO MAINTAIN THE

03:29:51.645 --> 03:29:53.981
PROPERTY. THIS IS A CRISIS FOR

03:29:54.048 --> 03:29:55.716
THEM AS WELL AND THAT'S WHY

03:29:55.783 --> 03:29:58.385
THIS BILL ALSO GIVES YOU THE

03:29:58.452 --> 03:30:00.220
RIGHT TO DEFER YOUR MORTGAGE

03:30:00.287 --> 03:30:03.257
PAYMENTS AS WELL. AND IF YOU IF

03:30:03.324 --> 03:30:04.525
YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO

03:30:04.591 --> 03:30:06.060
THAT IT IS IN THIS BILL AS IT

03:30:06.126 --> 03:30:08.729
HAS BEEN CRAFTED. YOU ARE GOING

03:30:08.796 --> 03:30:10.831
TO GET A FORBEARANCE AS WELL.

03:30:10.898 --> 03:30:13.100
THE BILL DOES NOT CANCEL

03:30:13.167 --> 03:30:15.869
ANYONE'S RENT. IT DOES NOT

03:30:15.936 --> 03:30:18.339
CANCEL MORTGAGES. AND I KNOW

03:30:18.405 --> 03:30:19.440
THERE IN THAT- ACTIVISTS OUT

03:30:19.506 --> 03:30:21.208
THERE DEMANDING THAT WE CANCEL

03:30:21.275 --> 03:30:23.477
THINGS BUT- I DON'T AGREE WITH

03:30:23.544 --> 03:30:24.545
THAT AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S

03:30:24.611 --> 03:30:26.146
FAIR. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S

03:30:26.213 --> 03:30:27.848
APPROPRIATE. FOR SMALL

03:30:27.915 --> 03:30:29.883
LANDLORDS HOME MORE OWNERS AND

03:30:29.950 --> 03:30:31.852
TENANTS ALIKE THE BILL

03:30:31.919 --> 03:30:34.455
TEMPORARILY DEFERS THOSE

03:30:34.521 --> 03:30:35.956
PAYMENTS. BUT EVERYONE STILL

03:30:36.023 --> 03:30:38.425
HAS TO PAY THEM EVENTUALLY.

03:30:38.492 --> 03:30:39.693
COMMITTEE STAFF HAS WORKED

03:30:39.760 --> 03:30:45.432
REALLY HARD ON THIS AND- TO TRY

03:30:45.499 --> 03:30:46.000
TO IDENTIFY EVERY INCENTIVE

03:30:46.066 --> 03:30:48.969
REPAIR POSSIBLE AND URGE THAT

03:30:49.036 --> 03:30:51.705
TO THEIR LANDLORDS. IT IS PART

03:30:51.772 --> 03:30:53.407
OF THIS BILL THE AMENDMENTS

03:30:53.474 --> 03:30:55.075
ALSO MAKE CLEAR THAT UNDER THE

03:30:55.142 --> 03:30:57.745
BILL LANDLORDS CAN EVICT

03:30:57.811 --> 03:30:59.580
TENANTS FOR ANY LAWFUL REASON.

03:30:59.646 --> 03:31:01.315
ANY LAWFUL REASON WHETHER IT'S

03:31:01.382 --> 03:31:03.317
NUISANCE OR DAMAGING PROPERTY

03:31:03.384 --> 03:31:04.852
OR BREAKING MATERIAL TERM OF

03:31:04.918 --> 03:31:07.821
TE LEASE THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS

03:31:07.888 --> 03:31:08.756
THAT IF THE REASON FOR THE

03:31:08.822 --> 03:31:10.691
EVICTION. IS THAT THE TENANT

03:31:10.758 --> 03:31:12.659
HAS FALLEN BEHIND ON THE RENT

03:31:12.726 --> 03:31:14.161
DURING THIS CALL OF A DYING

03:31:14.228 --> 03:31:16.930
TEEN PANDEMIC THEN THE LANDLORD

03:31:16.997 --> 03:31:18.332
MUST GIVE THE TENANT AN

03:31:18.399 --> 03:31:20.534
OPPORTUNITY TO DEFERRED THOSE

03:31:20.601 --> 03:31:22.136
PAYMENTS BY SIGNING AN

03:31:22.202 --> 03:31:24.238
ATTESTATION THAT THE TENANT HAS

03:31:24.304 --> 03:31:26.173
A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. DUE TO

03:31:26.240 --> 03:31:28.008
COVERT NINETEEN AND I WILL SAY

03:31:28.075 --> 03:31:29.943
WE'VE ALSO HAD DISCUSSIONS

03:31:30.010 --> 03:31:32.212
ABOUT WHAT THAT ATTESTATION

03:31:32.279 --> 03:31:33.947
SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND THAT I

03:31:34.014 --> 03:31:35.482
THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WILL

03:31:35.549 --> 03:31:38.619
CONTINUE THAT DISCUSSION. GOING

03:31:38.685 --> 03:31:40.854
FORWARD IN THIS BILL. BUT THE

03:31:40.921 --> 03:31:43.991
KEY TO NOTE. THAT THIS BILL

03:31:44.058 --> 03:31:46.260
PROTECTS HOMEOWNERS FROM LOSING

03:31:46.326 --> 03:31:48.529
THEIR HOMES TO FORECLOSURE AS

03:31:48.595 --> 03:31:50.964
WELL. NACHOS PROTECTIONS FOR

03:31:51.031 --> 03:31:53.534
TENANTS AND SMALL LANDLORDS BUT

03:31:53.600 --> 03:31:54.935
FOR HOMEOWNERS AND THE LAST

03:31:55.002 --> 03:31:56.403
TIME WE HAD THIS IN THE GREAT

03:31:56.470 --> 03:31:58.138
RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND AND

03:31:58.205 --> 03:31:59.973
EIGHT THIS LEGISLATURE WAS

03:32:00.040 --> 03:32:02.009
CALLED UPON TO TRY TO CLEAN UP

03:32:02.076 --> 03:32:05.412
A MESS. THAT WAS CREATED

03:32:05.479 --> 03:32:05.913
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THOSE

03:32:05.979 --> 03:32:07.714
FORECLOSURES. WE ARE TRYING TO

03:32:07.781 --> 03:32:10.918
ACT PROACTIVELY IN THIS CASE TO

03:32:10.984 --> 03:32:13.520
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING AND

03:32:13.587 --> 03:32:16.056
AS THE ANALYSIS DISCUSSES-

03:32:16.123 --> 03:32:18.826
THERE ARE. OF COMPONENT TO THIS

03:32:18.892 --> 03:32:20.594
BILL WE HAVE CREATED AN

03:32:20.661 --> 03:32:23.897
EXCEPTION FOR CREDIT UNIONS AND

03:32:23.964 --> 03:32:27.601
SMALL LENDERS- HOW FOR COMMUTE

03:32:27.668 --> 03:32:30.304
HUMANITY COMES TO BEAR TO MIND

03:32:30.370 --> 03:32:32.372
IS ONE THAT. THAT WE SHOULD BE

03:32:32.439 --> 03:32:34.408
RECOGNIZING DOES UNIQUE AND

03:32:34.475 --> 03:32:35.676
EXTRAORDINARY WORK IN OUR

03:32:35.742 --> 03:32:39.413
COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND I

03:32:39.480 --> 03:32:42.049
THINK THAT- AGAIN FOR THOSE WHO

03:32:42.116 --> 03:32:45.786
HAVE BEEN IN OPPOSITION- THERE

03:32:45.853 --> 03:32:47.488
PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT WE ARE

03:32:47.554 --> 03:32:50.390
TRYING TO. CONSIDER WHAT'S BEST

03:32:50.457 --> 03:32:51.892
AND WHAT IS FAIR FOR SMALL

03:32:51.959 --> 03:32:54.461
LANDLORDS I WOULD LIKE TO

03:32:54.528 --> 03:32:57.064
INVITE THE BANKS- AND IN THOSE

03:32:57.131 --> 03:32:59.700
FOLKS WHO HAVE COME IN

03:32:59.766 --> 03:33:02.002
ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO IT THAT MY

03:33:02.069 --> 03:33:02.803
FRIENDS AT THE CHURCH COMMERCE

03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:08.709
TO VIEW SUCH. A MAKES NO SENSE

03:33:08.775 --> 03:33:09.376
TO ME BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL

03:33:09.443 --> 03:33:12.679
IT A WHAT'S YOUR PLAN. HOW ARE

03:33:12.746 --> 03:33:13.280
WE GOING TO PEOPLE SO THAT WE

03:33:13.347 --> 03:33:14.982
DON'T HAVE THIS CATASTROPHIC

03:33:15.048 --> 03:33:16.750
EVENT AS A RESULT OF THE

03:33:16.817 --> 03:33:18.252
CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT WE ARE

03:33:18.318 --> 03:33:21.922
IN NOW.AND SO- AGAIN- THERE

03:33:21.989 --> 03:33:23.957
ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT-

03:33:24.024 --> 03:33:25.692
THE AUTHORS HAVE DONE TO TRY TO

03:33:25.759 --> 03:33:27.961
ASSIST THE OPPONENTS OF THIS

03:33:28.028 --> 03:33:30.931
BILL- I WON'T GET INTO THAT IF

03:33:30.998 --> 03:33:32.232
OTHERS WANT TO DO THAT TO

03:33:32.299 --> 03:33:33.834
GETTING INTO THE WEEDS OF IT WE

03:33:33.901 --> 03:33:34.735
CERTAINLY COULD HAVE A

03:33:34.801 --> 03:33:36.136
CONVERSATION. BUT AGAIN THE

03:33:36.203 --> 03:33:38.505
SPIRIT OF THIS BILL IS TO BRING

03:33:38.572 --> 03:33:40.774
EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE REQUIRE

03:33:40.841 --> 03:33:42.009
EVERYBODY OF LITTLE SKIN IN

03:33:42.075 --> 03:33:43.710
THIS GAME NO ONE'S GONNA

03:33:43.777 --> 03:33:46.313
BENEFIT AND MAKE OUT LIKE A

03:33:46.380 --> 03:33:50.417
BANDIT IF YOU WILL AS A RESULT

03:33:50.484 --> 03:33:50.984
OF THIS PANDEMIC NO. BUT IT

03:33:51.051 --> 03:33:53.854
SHOULD. REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU

03:33:53.921 --> 03:33:56.857
LIVE. FIRST HERE THE FACT OF

03:33:56.924 --> 03:33:58.058
THE MATTER IS THERE SHOULD BE

03:33:58.125 --> 03:33:59.960
NOBODY WHO COMES OUT THE

03:34:00.027 --> 03:34:02.062
BETTER. FOR THE FACT THAT WE

03:34:02.129 --> 03:34:05.132
HAVE LOST. A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

03:34:05.199 --> 03:34:06.733
THOUSAND LIVES IN THIS COUNTRY.

03:34:06.800 --> 03:34:08.268
AND ELEVEN THOUSAND HERE IN

03:34:08.335 --> 03:34:10.637
CALIFORNIA TO ME THAT WOULD BE

03:34:10.704 --> 03:34:12.472
NOT ONLY DISGRACEFUL. BUT A

03:34:12.539 --> 03:34:15.542
MORAL. AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE

03:34:15.609 --> 03:34:19.413
ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. FROM

03:34:19.479 --> 03:34:20.247
THE BANKERS DOWN TO THE LITTLE

03:34:20.314 --> 03:34:22.950
THAT. WRECK WE ALL HAVE A

03:34:23.016 --> 03:34:27.387
RESPONSIBILITY. TO MEET THOSE

03:34:27.454 --> 03:34:28.422
EXPECTATIONS BUT IN THIS CALL

03:34:28.488 --> 03:34:30.557
NINETY CRIED. THIS IS A CHANNEL.

03:34:30.624 --> 03:34:31.992
THAT I BELIEVE THIS BILL TRIES

03:34:32.059 --> 03:34:34.061
TO ADDRESS IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR

03:34:34.127 --> 03:34:36.129
AND APPROPRIATE. THOSE ARE MY

03:34:36.196 --> 03:34:39.900
TWO CENTS PROBABLY TWENTY CENTS

03:34:39.967 --> 03:34:42.102
BUT I WILL GO WITH THE- SENATOR

03:34:42.169 --> 03:34:44.504
ABOARD SHIPS AND THEN FOR BY.

03:34:44.571 --> 03:34:50.444
RUSSELL. THANK YOU CHAIR. THAT

03:34:50.510 --> 03:34:53.513
SUITS. WE BEGIN THIS AT AM IT'S

03:34:53.580 --> 03:34:56.250
ALMOST THIRTY BY THE TIME WE

03:34:56.316 --> 03:35:00.554
GOT TO THE ACTUAL SUB OF THE-

03:35:00.621 --> 03:35:01.121
THIS COULD BE A LAW NIGHT I

03:35:01.188 --> 03:35:06.860
THINK CENTER MY- SAID IT BEST.

03:35:06.927 --> 03:35:08.195
I THINK IT'S AN THAT WE IGNORE

03:35:08.262 --> 03:35:11.531
ALL THAT THERE WAS IN. IN THIS

03:35:11.598 --> 03:35:14.368
IDEA OUR THAT THIS LEGISLATION

03:35:14.434 --> 03:35:16.436
ALLOWS FOR ATTENTION TO BE

03:35:16.503 --> 03:35:19.039
BROUGHT TO THE SMALL PROPERTY

03:35:19.106 --> 03:35:20.607
OWNERS AND I'LL DEFINITELY GIVE

03:35:20.674 --> 03:35:22.576
YOU CREDIT FOR THAT I THINK ONE

03:35:22.643 --> 03:35:23.210
OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS THAT

03:35:23.277 --> 03:35:25.512
I'VE HAD AT LEAST ON FLOOR

03:35:25.579 --> 03:35:27.247
VOTES. WITH SOME OF THE THINGS

03:35:27.314 --> 03:35:29.283
THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IS

03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:31.451
THAT HE WAS ONLY THE RENTER'S.

03:35:31.518 --> 03:35:33.587
AND THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF

03:35:33.654 --> 03:35:34.921
INTERRELATED ENTITIES HERE

03:35:34.988 --> 03:35:36.990
BETWEEN THE RENTERS. THE

03:35:37.057 --> 03:35:40.260
LANDLORDS THE CAPITAL MARKETS-

03:35:40.327 --> 03:35:42.396
IN EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW SOME OF

03:35:42.462 --> 03:35:44.164
THOSE ARE POWERFUL IT OUT OVER

03:35:44.231 --> 03:35:45.932
THE WORLD. SO YOU CAN'T JUST

03:35:45.999 --> 03:35:48.902
LOOK UPON THEM BEEN SEGMENTED

03:35:48.969 --> 03:35:50.003
WAYS IT'S ALMOST IMPERATIVE THE

03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:51.371
YEP DO APPRECIATE. THE

03:35:51.438 --> 03:35:53.040
CONTINUUM OF INTERESTED

03:35:53.106 --> 03:35:54.941
PARTIES. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

03:35:55.008 --> 03:35:57.711
SOLVE A PROBLEM BY IGNORING

03:35:57.778 --> 03:35:59.713
THOSE OTHER PARTIES. IF I MAY

03:35:59.780 --> 03:36:01.448
THROUGH THE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO

03:36:01.515 --> 03:36:02.416
JUST KIND OF JUMP AROUND A

03:36:02.482 --> 03:36:04.751
LITTLE BIT FOR CLARITY ON AND

03:36:04.818 --> 03:36:10.924
ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES. SO.

03:36:10.991 --> 03:36:13.460
LET'S START WITH THE TENANT

03:36:13.527 --> 03:36:17.497
HARDSHIP I'M FROM LET'S LOOK AT

03:36:17.564 --> 03:36:19.066
THE LANGUAGE I THINK I HAVE A

03:36:19.132 --> 03:36:21.034
DECENT APPRECIATION OF WHAT IT

03:36:21.101 --> 03:36:23.103
IS I DON'T WHAT I DON'T

03:36:23.170 --> 03:36:24.771
NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND IS WHY

03:36:24.838 --> 03:36:27.007
WE'RE NOT HOLDING. OUR THE

03:36:27.074 --> 03:36:28.542
ATTESTATION IN THE

03:36:28.608 --> 03:36:30.577
DEMONSTRATION OF HARDSHIP TO A

03:36:30.644 --> 03:36:33.113
HIGHER LEVEL. FROM WHAT I READ

03:36:33.180 --> 03:36:35.382
THAT THERE IS SIMPLY A

03:36:35.449 --> 03:36:37.217
REPRESENTATION THAT I SUFFER

03:36:37.284 --> 03:36:40.654
HARDSHIP- 10% OR WHATEVER IT

03:36:40.721 --> 03:36:45.225
IS. A DECREASE IN- IN INCOME

03:36:45.292 --> 03:36:47.127
THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT. SO ONE

03:36:47.194 --> 03:36:49.196
THING I WOULD WANT AND MAYBE

03:36:49.262 --> 03:36:51.231
YOU CAN COMMENT ON. IS WHY

03:36:51.298 --> 03:36:52.666
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO MAKE IT A

03:36:52.733 --> 03:36:56.703
FORMAL ATTESTATION UNDER

03:36:56.770 --> 03:36:59.039
PENALTY OF PERJURY. AND ALSO A

03:36:59.106 --> 03:37:01.141
COMPANY THAT TO THE EXTENT

03:37:01.208 --> 03:37:03.510
POSSIBLE WITH SOME SORT OF

03:37:03.577 --> 03:37:05.645
REPRESENTATION SOME SORT OF

03:37:05.712 --> 03:37:07.814
FINANCIAL REPRESENTATION.

03:37:07.881 --> 03:37:09.249
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK

03:37:09.316 --> 03:37:10.984
IT IT IT ASKS FOR THAT. IF YOU

03:37:11.051 --> 03:37:14.821
SAID THAT HAS IMPACTED MINE

03:37:14.888 --> 03:37:17.124
MINE ECONOMICS AND THAT'S ALL I

03:37:17.190 --> 03:37:18.992
HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE I'M NOT

03:37:19.059 --> 03:37:20.494
CERTAIN THAT WHICH IS A

03:37:20.560 --> 03:37:22.496
REASONABLE OR FAIR AND THE

03:37:22.562 --> 03:37:24.464
CIRCUMSTANCES. I ASK YOU TO

03:37:24.531 --> 03:37:26.333
CONSIDER THAT MEAN MAYBE IF YOU

03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:28.502
HAVE A COMMENT WHY. WASN'T THAT

03:37:28.568 --> 03:37:31.872
ELEVATE. SURE HAPPY TO THAT LET

03:37:31.938 --> 03:37:33.273
ME FIRST JUST START BY SAYING

03:37:33.340 --> 03:37:34.508
THE ORIGINAL VERSION THE BILL

03:37:34.574 --> 03:37:35.609
ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE

03:37:35.675 --> 03:37:37.411
ATTESTATION LANGUAGE AND THE

03:37:37.477 --> 03:37:39.079
RATIONALE FOR THAT WAS WE KNOW

03:37:39.146 --> 03:37:40.480
THAT ALL TENANTS ARE STRUGGLING

03:37:40.547 --> 03:37:42.883
AND THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD.

03:37:42.949 --> 03:37:43.984
REQUIRE ANYTHING GIVEN THE

03:37:44.050 --> 03:37:45.786
SITUATION WOULD BE CHALLENGING

03:37:45.852 --> 03:37:47.954
BUT- AT THE REQUEST OF THE

03:37:48.021 --> 03:37:49.823
CHAIR AND OTHERS- WE MOVE

03:37:49.890 --> 03:37:50.857
FORWARD IN ANTICIPATION

03:37:50.924 --> 03:37:52.225
REQUIREMENT AGAIN FOR THE VERY

03:37:52.292 --> 03:37:53.794
POINT OF WE WANT TO OBVIOUSLY

03:37:53.860 --> 03:37:55.796
FOCUSES ON PEOPLE HAVE NEEDS.

03:37:55.862 --> 03:37:57.697
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THAT

03:37:57.764 --> 03:38:00.200
UNDER PENATY OF PERJURY IT IS

03:38:00.267 --> 03:38:02.202
NOT CURRENTLY- ONE OF THE

03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:03.737
CHALLENGES IF I MIGHT JUST

03:38:03.804 --> 03:38:04.604
INTERRUPT HIM PART OF THE

03:38:04.671 --> 03:38:05.939
REASON IT ISN'T IS IT IT'S

03:38:06.006 --> 03:38:08.275
MODELED AFTER ACTUALLY THE

03:38:08.341 --> 03:38:10.510
FEDERAL VERSION. CURRENTLY NOW

03:38:10.577 --> 03:38:12.012
UNDER THE FEDERAL VERSION INDIA

03:38:12.078 --> 03:38:14.181
THANK BE SIMPLE AT. AND DOES

03:38:14.247 --> 03:38:16.550
REQUIRE ANYTHING MORE SO THAT

03:38:16.616 --> 03:38:18.885
WE IT WAS MODEL YOU MODELED IT

03:38:18.952 --> 03:38:20.587
AFTER WHAT IS THE CURRENT

03:38:20.654 --> 03:38:22.556
FEDERAL ATTESTATION SO I THINK

03:38:22.622 --> 03:38:24.458
THAT PUTS IT A LITTLE BIT IN

03:38:24.524 --> 03:38:25.792
CONTEXT BUT THE QUESTION SALUTE

03:38:25.859 --> 03:38:27.727
IS A VALID POINT I'M SORRY TO

03:38:27.794 --> 03:38:30.096
INTERRUPT A IS ACTUALLY SO-

03:38:30.163 --> 03:38:32.399
MANAGER- HAD MENTIONED. ONE KEY

03:38:32.466 --> 03:38:33.667
POINT WHICH IS WHICH IS WHAT

03:38:33.733 --> 03:38:34.968
SHE JUST SAID ANOTHER CHALLENGE

03:38:35.035 --> 03:38:37.237
HAS BEEN- THEIR UGGESTION THAT

03:38:37.304 --> 03:38:38.705
THERE ARE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS

03:38:38.772 --> 03:38:40.307
THAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED YOU

03:38:40.373 --> 03:38:41.875
SHOW A BANK STATEMENT YOU SHOW-

03:38:41.942 --> 03:38:50.417
SOME EMPLOYER. AND WE. KNOW

03:38:50.484 --> 03:38:51.017
THAT THERE ARE SO MANY TENANTS

03:38:51.084 --> 03:38:52.786
WHO. CAN WHERE THE- FRANKLY

03:38:52.853 --> 03:38:53.720
JUST IN PA TO GET. SO IF YOU

03:38:53.787 --> 03:38:55.021
WORK FOR. A SMALL THAT HAS GONE

03:38:55.088 --> 03:38:55.622
ON AND YOU CAN EVEN FOR YOUR

03:38:55.689 --> 03:38:57.591
BOSS. IF YOU UNDOCUMENTED

03:38:57.657 --> 03:39:00.427
YOU'RE GETTING PAID- IN IN TO

03:39:00.494 --> 03:39:01.394
THROUGH THROUGH DIFFERENT MONEY

03:39:01.461 --> 03:39:03.029
ECONOMIES IF YOU'RE ON BANKS

03:39:03.096 --> 03:39:04.431
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

03:39:04.498 --> 03:39:06.299
BANKING STATEMENT SO. THE IDEA

03:39:06.366 --> 03:39:08.401
THAT SOMEHOW- YOU NEED TO PROVE

03:39:08.468 --> 03:39:10.470
WITH DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU

03:39:10.537 --> 03:39:12.672
HAVE SUFFERED- AND ECONOMIC IT

03:39:12.739 --> 03:39:13.740
IS IT'S JUST FRANKLY CAN BE

03:39:13.807 --> 03:39:15.208
VERY DIFFICULT. SO THIS

03:39:15.275 --> 03:39:16.510
CONVERSATION HAS NOT BEEN

03:39:16.576 --> 03:39:18.845
SIMPLE BUT I WILL SAY. IT IS AN

03:39:18.912 --> 03:39:21.848
ONGOING CONVERSATION- AND- WE

03:39:21.915 --> 03:39:23.483
ARE CERTAINLY IN FOR FURTHER

03:39:23.550 --> 03:39:24.484
DISCUSSION WITH ALL THE

03:39:24.551 --> 03:39:26.119
STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT'S THE

03:39:26.186 --> 03:39:27.554
RIGHT WAY DISTRICT THE BALANCE

03:39:27.621 --> 03:39:28.288
BECAUSE I THINK WE WANT TO

03:39:28.355 --> 03:39:30.657
ENSURE IS. THOSE INDIVIDUALS

03:39:30.724 --> 03:39:31.424
WHO NEED THIS HELP SHOULD BE

03:39:31.491 --> 03:39:33.326
ABLE TO GET IT. WE DON'T WANT

03:39:33.393 --> 03:39:34.661
TO CREATE SUCH A DOCUMENTATION

03:39:34.728 --> 03:39:36.663
REQUIREMENT TO DETERMINE THAT-

03:39:36.730 --> 03:39:38.131
WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO SCARE

03:39:38.198 --> 03:39:40.367
FOLKS OFF WHO- MAY NOT HAVE

03:39:40.433 --> 03:39:42.569
ACCESS TO AN ATTORNEY AND I

03:39:42.636 --> 03:39:43.069
SHOULD. MENTION IN THIS

03:39:43.136 --> 03:39:45.672
CONTEXT. TYPICALLY IN LANDLORD

03:39:45.739 --> 03:39:47.974
TENANT THE LANDLORD TENANT.

03:39:48.041 --> 03:39:53.313
LAWSUITS. LANDLORDS ARE

03:39:53.380 --> 03:39:53.947
REPRESENTED NINETY PER OF THE

03:39:54.014 --> 03:39:55.682
TIME. TENANTS WERE LESS THAN

03:39:55.749 --> 03:39:57.050
10% OF THE TIME SO ANYTHING

03:39:57.117 --> 03:39:58.585
THAT WERE. A YOU PENALTY

03:39:58.652 --> 03:40:00.053
APPROACH FOR SOMEONE COULD BE

03:40:00.120 --> 03:40:02.889
PROSECUTOR HAS A CHILLING OF

03:40:02.956 --> 03:40:03.557
AND IF THEIR DOCTOR

03:40:03.623 --> 03:40:04.891
REQUIREMENTS A TOUCH THAT THAT

03:40:04.958 --> 03:40:05.725
MAKES IT REALLY HARD SO THAT'S

03:40:05.792 --> 03:40:07.527
WHY THIS ISSUE IS COMPLICATED

03:40:07.594 --> 03:40:09.029
BUT YOUR BEGINNER TO MY EARLIER

03:40:09.095 --> 03:40:09.663
POINT WE ARE STILL WORKING

03:40:09.729 --> 03:40:11.865
THROUGH THIS AND- AND I SUSPECT

03:40:11.932 --> 03:40:12.699
THEY'LL BE MORE CONVERSATIONS

03:40:12.766 --> 03:40:14.634
AGAIN I AND I DO APPRECIATE

03:40:14.701 --> 03:40:16.636
THAT I THINK. THERE ARE SOME

03:40:16.703 --> 03:40:18.505
UNDERLYING REALITIES WHERE THAT

03:40:18.572 --> 03:40:22.576
WOULD POSE A DIFFICULTY- I

03:40:22.642 --> 03:40:23.743
THINK ULTIMATELY HOWEVER. TO BE

03:40:23.810 --> 03:40:26.146
FAIR. THERE NEEDS TO BE A

03:40:26.212 --> 03:40:30.050
SERIOUS- REASSESSMENT ON THE

03:40:30.116 --> 03:40:32.652
DOCUMENTATION AND ATTESTATION-

03:40:32.719 --> 03:40:33.954
TO MAKE THAT BETTER LIMIT A

03:40:34.020 --> 03:40:38.792
LIMIT LET ME MOVE ON. THE

03:40:38.858 --> 03:40:40.293
DECLARATION OF EMERGENCIES

03:40:40.360 --> 03:40:42.062
INCLUDES BOTH THE STATE AND

03:40:42.128 --> 03:40:45.732
LOCAL ENTITIES SO THAT. IS THAT

03:40:45.799 --> 03:40:46.533
CORRECT THAT WITH THIS HE

03:40:46.600 --> 03:40:48.001
ACTUALLY I TRY TO LEAVE ALSO

03:40:48.068 --> 03:40:50.103
WITH THE CHAIRS SPA SUGGESTION

03:40:50.170 --> 03:40:51.171
WE TOOK OUT THE LOCAL

03:40:51.237 --> 03:40:53.239
EMERGENCIES PIECE IN AT THIS

03:40:53.306 --> 03:40:55.508
POINT SO WHAT. WE DID START

03:40:55.575 --> 03:40:56.443
WITH THE DRAFT STATE AND LOCAL

03:40:56.509 --> 03:40:58.111
I BELIEVE AT THIS POINT WE'VE

03:40:58.178 --> 03:40:59.946
TAKEN OUT THE LOCAL THIS IS THE

03:41:00.013 --> 03:41:01.715
CHALLENGE OF THEIR TRUNCATED TO

03:41:01.781 --> 03:41:05.752
LEGISLATIVE ACCOUNT. OR HAVING

03:41:05.819 --> 03:41:07.053
GOTTEN IT THIS MORNING. IN ON

03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:07.721
THIS IS GONE THROUGH QUITE A

03:41:07.787 --> 03:41:09.689
FEW AND THEN. THAT ARE THAT ARE

03:41:09.756 --> 03:41:13.827
AND ALL ALL GO IN MOVE ON. FOR

03:41:13.893 --> 03:41:15.228
THOSE FOR THOSE LOAN THAT HAVE

03:41:15.295 --> 03:41:17.597
BEEN PACKAGED BEHIND THEM THIS

03:41:17.664 --> 03:41:19.766
WERE HERE THE CORPORATE LARGER

03:41:19.833 --> 03:41:22.535
ENTITIES- THE INVESTMENT TRUSTS

03:41:22.602 --> 03:41:23.603
THIS IS WHERE I HEAR THEIR

03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:26.673
ANGST ON THIS. IS THAT IF YOU

03:41:26.740 --> 03:41:28.742
TAKE AWAY ON THE OBLIGATIONS OF

03:41:28.808 --> 03:41:30.543
THE RENTERS IN CAN FOR THE

03:41:30.610 --> 03:41:34.014
SMALL- MOM AND POP. A MULTI

03:41:34.080 --> 03:41:36.449
FAMILY UNITS. THERE'S A MASSIVE

03:41:36.516 --> 03:41:37.717
SEGMENT OF THE INDUSTRY THAT

03:41:37.784 --> 03:41:40.587
INCLUDES THE CORPORATE ENTITIES

03:41:40.654 --> 03:41:42.022
THE INVESTMENT TRUSTS VENTURE

03:41:42.088 --> 03:41:43.923
CAPITALIST SO ON AND SO FORTH.

03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:46.660
THESE INDIVIDUALS. ARE GOING TO

03:41:46.726 --> 03:41:48.528
BE ON THE HOOK RIGHT SO I GUESS

03:41:48.595 --> 03:41:52.399
MY QUESTION IS. IF THE DAY ARE

03:41:52.465 --> 03:41:55.568
PUBLICLY TRADED FOR THAT. FIFTY

03:41:55.635 --> 03:41:57.904
M. LOANS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN

03:41:57.971 --> 03:41:59.839
PACKAGE PORTFOLIO IN FLOATED ON

03:41:59.906 --> 03:42:01.274
THE MARKET EITHER DOMESTICALLY

03:42:01.341 --> 03:42:03.977
OVERSEAS. HOW DOES THIS PLAY

03:42:04.044 --> 03:42:10.216
OUT DO WE KNOW. YES BUT AS OUR

03:42:10.283 --> 03:42:11.618
ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE CHAIRED

03:42:11.685 --> 03:42:14.921
SUDAN'S. THE BILL IS FOCUSED ON

03:42:14.988 --> 03:42:17.424
MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE FOR AN

03:42:17.490 --> 03:42:19.759
UNDER UNITS SO IT REALLY

03:42:19.826 --> 03:42:21.594
DEPENDS I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT A

03:42:21.661 --> 03:42:23.063
CORPORATION THAT BIG WOULD ONLY

03:42:23.129 --> 03:42:27.267
HAVE FOUR. UNITS AND THIS BILL

03:42:27.333 --> 03:42:29.436
DOES NOT SOLVE FOR ANYONE WHO

03:42:29.502 --> 03:42:33.473
HAD MORE THAN FOUR UNITS IN

03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:34.741
TERMS OF FOR EXACTLY THAT. THIS

03:42:34.808 --> 03:42:36.242
MIGHT IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:37.811
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE

03:42:37.877 --> 03:42:40.680
ENVISIONED. AS OUTLINED IN THE

03:42:40.747 --> 03:42:43.550
LEGISLATION. AND I KIND OF GO

03:42:43.616 --> 03:42:45.285
BACK TO THE CONTINUUM. OF

03:42:45.351 --> 03:42:47.420
INTERESTED PARTIES WITHIN THE

03:42:47.487 --> 03:42:50.256
INDUSTRY ITSELF I DON'T KNOW IF

03:42:50.323 --> 03:42:51.958
ANY FINAL THOUGHTS ON WE'RE

03:42:52.025 --> 03:42:54.461
LEAVING OUT LARGER ENTITIES

03:42:54.527 --> 03:42:57.363
MEDIUM TO LARGER AND EVEN

03:42:57.430 --> 03:42:57.931
INTERNATIONAL ENTITIES FROM

03:42:57.997 --> 03:43:01.334
THIS- THE BILL ITSELF ON THE

03:43:01.401 --> 03:43:02.635
MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE SIDE IT'S

03:43:02.702 --> 03:43:05.705
FOCUSED ON. THE AREAS FOCUSED

03:43:05.772 --> 03:43:08.274
ON SMALLER LANDLORDS- AS

03:43:08.341 --> 03:43:09.442
OPPOSED TO THE CORPORATE ONES

03:43:09.509 --> 03:43:11.778
OR BIGGER ONES- AND IT WAS

03:43:11.845 --> 03:43:14.347
DESIGNED THAT WAY- IT BECAUSE

03:43:14.414 --> 03:43:15.215
WE THOUGHT WHERE IS THE

03:43:15.281 --> 03:43:17.550
GREATEST NEED I THINK THAT IF

03:43:17.617 --> 03:43:19.552
YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE. PACKAGE

03:43:19.619 --> 03:43:21.621
IN THE ENTIRE BILL IT DOESN'T

03:43:21.688 --> 03:43:23.456
ACTUALLY HAD IT FOR EVERYBODY

03:43:23.523 --> 03:43:25.191
NOT EVERYONE BENEFITS FROM THIS

03:43:25.258 --> 03:43:26.826
BILL BUT WE ARE TRYING TO

03:43:26.893 --> 03:43:27.694
ADDRESS FOR THE GREATEST

03:43:27.761 --> 03:43:30.196
FINANCIAL NEED CAN BE AND SO WE

03:43:30.263 --> 03:43:32.532
FOCUSED ON THE SMALL. LANDLORDS

03:43:32.599 --> 03:43:34.267
AND TENANTS ALL RIGHT SO HERE

03:43:34.334 --> 03:43:35.702
AND I'LL FINISH UP WITH A LOT

03:43:35.769 --> 03:43:37.470
OF LAST POINTS THAT HAVE CAUGHT

03:43:37.537 --> 03:43:41.174
MY ATTENTION WE'VE DISCUSSED AT

03:43:41.241 --> 03:43:44.511
LENGTH. WHAT THE MARKET IS. THE

03:43:44.577 --> 03:43:45.879
HOUSING DIFFICULTIES THAT WE'VE

03:43:45.945 --> 03:43:47.313
EXPERIENCED IN THE STATE

03:43:47.380 --> 03:43:48.848
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:43:48.915 --> 03:43:50.784
PHILOSOPHIES SOME HAVE.

03:43:50.850 --> 03:43:52.719
REFERENCE FOR RENT CONTROL SOME

03:43:52.786 --> 03:43:53.653
HAVE FREE MARKET SO ON AND SO

03:43:53.720 --> 03:43:57.290
FORTH. BUT SHOULD WE BE

03:43:57.357 --> 03:44:00.326
CONCERNED THAT THIS FORBEARANCE

03:44:00.393 --> 03:44:02.729
PROCESS ULTIMATELY WILL BE

03:44:02.796 --> 03:44:06.332
BORNE BY THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

03:44:06.399 --> 03:44:09.803
THE THIS WILL DIS INCENTIVIZE.

03:44:09.869 --> 03:44:12.105
THE FLOW OF CAPITAL. ONE IT

03:44:12.172 --> 03:44:13.473
WOULD DISINCENTIVE EYES THE

03:44:13.540 --> 03:44:15.441
FLOW OF CAPITAL A NUMBER TWO

03:44:15.508 --> 03:44:16.776
FOR THOSE ENTITIES WISHING TO

03:44:16.843 --> 03:44:18.978
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR

03:44:19.045 --> 03:44:20.947
MULTI FAMILY UNITS AT A LARGER

03:44:21.014 --> 03:44:26.085
SCALE. THE RATIO OF ELIGIBILITY.

03:44:26.152 --> 03:44:26.719
FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS SEEKING A

03:44:26.786 --> 03:44:29.055
LOAN THEY MIGHT BE CAPPED OUT

03:44:29.122 --> 03:44:30.290
OF THE MARKET BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

03:44:30.356 --> 03:44:32.025
GONNA BE LOOKING AT TWENTY FIVE

03:44:32.091 --> 03:44:35.995
OR 50% DOWN ON THESE CAPITAL.

03:44:36.062 --> 03:44:37.530
INVESTMENTS LENDING

03:44:37.597 --> 03:44:38.932
INSTITUTIONS MIGHT ACTUALLY

03:44:38.998 --> 03:44:42.268
YANKED OUT ALL THE WAY UP 275%

03:44:42.335 --> 03:44:42.836
OR WHATEVER THAT THE MARKET

03:44:42.902 --> 03:44:45.538
WILL BEAR ARE WE NOT CONCERNED

03:44:45.605 --> 03:44:47.540
THAT WE'RE SOLVING A SHORT TERM

03:44:47.607 --> 03:44:49.609
ISSUE POSSIBLY A MEDIUM BUT

03:44:49.676 --> 03:44:53.012
CREATING SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM

03:44:53.079 --> 03:44:55.481
HOUSING PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA.

03:44:55.548 --> 03:44:57.183
TO ALL ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN

03:44:57.250 --> 03:44:59.319
A IN A FEW WAYS SO- I THINK THE

03:44:59.385 --> 03:45:01.054
PARENTS OR IS IT MAY HAVE SOME

03:45:01.120 --> 03:45:02.922
IMPACT ON THOSE CREDIT MARKETS

03:45:02.989 --> 03:45:05.024
BUT THE CHOICES WE HAVE IN

03:45:05.091 --> 03:45:07.694
FRONT OF US ARE STARK. THE

03:45:07.760 --> 03:45:08.494
CHOICES ARE DO WE WANT TO SEE A

03:45:08.561 --> 03:45:10.396
WAVE OF MASS EVICTIONS. WHICH

03:45:10.463 --> 03:45:12.265
LEAD TO A WAVE OF MASS

03:45:12.332 --> 03:45:14.167
FORECLOSURES. WHICH WOULD

03:45:14.234 --> 03:45:17.470
DESTROY THE ECONOMY. OR DO WE

03:45:17.537 --> 03:45:19.973
WANT. ASK FOR EVERYONE TO TAKE

03:45:20.039 --> 03:45:21.708
A PAUSE FOR SAY SIX OR TWELVE

03:45:21.774 --> 03:45:24.143
MONTHS. IN ORDER FOR RENTERS TO

03:45:24.210 --> 03:45:25.044
GET ABOUT BACK ON THEIR FEET.

03:45:25.111 --> 03:45:26.379
TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK. THEIR

03:45:26.446 --> 03:45:27.981
LANDLORDS WHO CAN THEN TURN

03:45:28.047 --> 03:45:29.582
AROUND AND PAY BACK. THE

03:45:29.649 --> 03:45:31.651
MORTGAGE HOLDER AND STABILIZE

03:45:31.718 --> 03:45:32.852
THE MARKET. I WOULD SUBMIT.

03:45:32.919 --> 03:45:34.387
THAT THE IDEA THAT WE ARE GOING

03:45:34.454 --> 03:45:36.256
TO AFFECT. A GENERATION OF

03:45:36.322 --> 03:45:38.892
RENTERS. AND THEN HAVE A WAVE

03:45:38.958 --> 03:45:40.159
OF FORECLOSURES WOULD BE FAR

03:45:40.226 --> 03:45:41.160
MORE CATASTROPHIC TO THE

03:45:41.227 --> 03:45:42.395
ECONOMY THAT WE'RE PROPOSING

03:45:42.462 --> 03:45:44.530
RIGHT NOW- BUT I WOULD ALSO

03:45:44.597 --> 03:45:46.766
SUGGEST- YOU KNOW LISTEN I

03:45:46.833 --> 03:45:47.934
THINK. FOR ALL OF US THE IDEAL

03:45:48.001 --> 03:45:49.035
SOLUTION WOULD BE IF THE

03:45:49.102 --> 03:45:50.870
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. COULD

03:45:50.937 --> 03:45:53.539
INVEST MONEY- AND HELP

03:45:53.606 --> 03:45:54.407
STABILIZE THE ECONOMY THAT WE

03:45:54.474 --> 03:45:56.442
CAN STOCKLEY THAT'S EXACTLY

03:45:56.509 --> 03:45:57.777
WHERE I THINK. YOU NEED TO GO

03:45:57.844 --> 03:46:01.247
IF WE'RE IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT

03:46:01.314 --> 03:46:02.415
THIS. THE STATE HAS TO PLAY A

03:46:02.482 --> 03:46:05.018
ROLE. AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE

03:46:05.084 --> 03:46:07.620
EXPERIENCED POLITICALLY IS THAT

03:46:07.687 --> 03:46:08.621
THERE ARE SO MANY LIABILITIES

03:46:08.688 --> 03:46:11.124
IN SO MANY UNCERTAINTIES RIGHT

03:46:11.190 --> 03:46:13.192
NOW IN CALIFORNIA THAT THE ROLE

03:46:13.259 --> 03:46:16.029
THAT CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CAN

03:46:16.095 --> 03:46:18.264
PLAY THE TAXPAYERS CAN PLAY IN

03:46:18.331 --> 03:46:21.868
CREATING A FUND. TO HELP THAT

03:46:21.935 --> 03:46:22.402
CONTINUE IN THAT I KEEP ON

03:46:22.468 --> 03:46:25.271
TALKING ABOUT. WOULD PROBABLY

03:46:25.338 --> 03:46:27.073
BE POLITICALLY UNPALATABLE SO

03:46:27.140 --> 03:46:30.143
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THAT WERE

03:46:30.209 --> 03:46:30.710
USING THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE

03:46:30.777 --> 03:46:33.079
STATE. IN INTERFERING IN

03:46:33.146 --> 03:46:35.848
PRIVATE CONTRACTUAL SITUATIONS

03:46:35.915 --> 03:46:38.451
BASED ON A NEED. BUT WE HAVEN'T

03:46:38.518 --> 03:46:40.820
EVEN HEARD OF THIS OF ANY REAL

03:46:40.887 --> 03:46:43.323
SIGNIFICANT OP LOOK INVESTMENT

03:46:43.389 --> 03:46:46.426
INTO A STATE LOAN FOR SOME SORT

03:46:46.492 --> 03:46:49.329
OF ECONOMIC HOUSING FUND FROM

03:46:49.395 --> 03:46:51.164
WHICH INDIVIDUALS COULD DRAW.

03:46:51.230 --> 03:46:53.800
IN IN CREATE THAT BUT I MEAN

03:46:53.866 --> 03:46:55.401
IT'S A HERE'S MY LAST BUT IF I

03:46:55.468 --> 03:46:57.537

03:46:57.603 --> 03:46:58.071
HELP OUT A LITTLE LET HIM

03:46:58.137 --> 03:46:58.638
RESPOND I THINK THERE'S ONE

03:46:58.705 --> 03:47:00.039
THING HE SAID ABOUT THAT

03:47:00.106 --> 03:47:01.107
OBVIOUSLY THE BEST THING THAT

03:47:01.174 --> 03:47:02.008
COULD HAPPEN HERE IS IF THE

03:47:02.075 --> 03:47:03.810
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD ASSIST

03:47:03.876 --> 03:47:07.113
US. STATE TO BUY THE TO GET WE

03:47:07.180 --> 03:47:08.014
DON'T GET THE PRINT MONEY THAT

03:47:08.081 --> 03:47:09.382
SPRINT PROPHECY WE CAN'T WE

03:47:09.449 --> 03:47:12.085
CAN'T PRINT MONEY. AND WE JUST

03:47:12.151 --> 03:47:13.353
SAW FOR FIFTY FOUR BILLION

03:47:13.419 --> 03:47:15.054
DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT SO THE

03:47:15.121 --> 03:47:16.656
IDEA THAT THERE ARE MANY

03:47:16.723 --> 03:47:18.057
PENNIES UNDER THE COUCH THAT WE

03:47:18.124 --> 03:47:20.293
CAN PUT TOGETHER THE PIECES

03:47:20.360 --> 03:47:24.864
IT'S CHALLENGING- THE

03:47:24.931 --> 03:47:27.633
WASHINGTON. NOT ACTED. WE HAVE

03:47:27.700 --> 03:47:30.436
A TWO WEEK CLOCK TICK WE COULD

03:47:30.503 --> 03:47:32.138
SEE. LITERALLY NO OF TENANTS

03:47:32.205 --> 03:47:33.406
INTO WHO COULD FACE OF X.

03:47:33.473 --> 03:47:35.174
NOTICES WE HAVE TO SOLVE THIS

03:47:35.241 --> 03:47:36.109
PROBLEM IF THERE'S A BETTER WAY

03:47:36.175 --> 03:47:38.044
TO DO IT I AM ALL EARS BUT I

03:47:38.111 --> 03:47:40.513
THINK UNTIL. ANYONE ELSE TELLS

03:47:40.580 --> 03:47:41.681
US THAT THEY'RE GONNA COME TO

03:47:41.748 --> 03:47:42.515
THE RESCUE WITH A HUGE AMOUNT

03:47:42.582 --> 03:47:43.549
OF MONEY WE'VE GOT TO SOLVE

03:47:43.616 --> 03:47:45.351
THIS FOR OURSELVES AND THIS IS

03:47:45.418 --> 03:47:46.552
THE BEST IDEA WE'VE BEEN ABLE

03:47:46.619 --> 03:47:47.854
TO COME UP WITH RIGHT NOW AND I

03:47:47.920 --> 03:47:48.821
CAN APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE

03:47:48.888 --> 03:47:53.359
YOUR EFFORT- MY FINAL CONCERN.

03:47:53.426 --> 03:47:57.864
IS THAT. THIS WILL. ALMOST

03:47:57.930 --> 03:47:58.331
CERTAINLY BRING ABOUT

03:47:58.398 --> 03:48:01.567
LITIGATION. ARMY AND I'VE I

03:48:01.634 --> 03:48:03.403
WOULD HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT.

03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:05.571
YOU KNOW CONSTITUTIONALITY. THE

03:48:05.638 --> 03:48:06.472
FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUE

03:48:06.539 --> 03:48:07.974
SOMEONE AND SO FORTH. THE

03:48:08.041 --> 03:48:09.575
REASON I BRING UP THOSE LIKE

03:48:09.642 --> 03:48:11.511
THOSE. LEGAL LIABILITIES IS

03:48:11.577 --> 03:48:14.180
ONLY BECAUSE IT MAY STALL OUT.

03:48:14.247 --> 03:48:17.784
THIS PROCESS SO WE HAVE TO ALSO

03:48:17.850 --> 03:48:20.119
BE THINKING ABOUT A PLAN B. IN

03:48:20.186 --> 03:48:21.654
THE EVENTUALITY THAT THIS IDEA

03:48:21.721 --> 03:48:23.956
DOESN'T WORK BUT MY LAST

03:48:24.023 --> 03:48:26.192
QUESTION IS CREDIT WORTHINESS

03:48:26.259 --> 03:48:27.660
SO I BELIEVE IN THE

03:48:27.727 --> 03:48:29.729
LEGISLATION. CREDIT RATING

03:48:29.796 --> 03:48:31.064

03:48:31.130 --> 03:48:34.500
ACCOUNT- THIS PERIOD OF TIME

03:48:34.567 --> 03:48:36.736
DURING FORBEARANCE. BUT RENTS

03:48:36.803 --> 03:48:38.071
ARE STILL GOING TO BE DO NOW

03:48:38.137 --> 03:48:40.406
LET'S BE REALISTIC SOMEONE AS A

03:48:40.473 --> 03:48:42.909

IS DUE- CHANCES ARE. A LOT

03:48:46.612 --> 03:48:47.914
THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET PAID

03:48:47.980 --> 03:48:50.049
BACK WANTS COME DUE. OR THEY

03:48:50.116 --> 03:48:51.350
ARE GOING TO FAIL TO

03:48:51.417 --> 03:48:53.653
RENEGOTIATE UNDER NEW TERMS- AS

03:48:53.719 --> 03:48:55.855

03:54:36.829 --> 03:54:37.396
OF THINGS THAT WE COULD DO WITH

03:54:37.463 --> 03:54:39.098
YOUR BILL TO MAKE IT. BIGGER

PEOPLE. BUT IT'S BETTER TO GO

03:54:58.150 --> 03:54:59.318
THROUGH SOMETHING RIGHT NOW

IN A YEAR OR SO. AS FAR AS-

03:55:21.407 --> 03:55:23.876
RENTS OR MORTGAGES THAT HAVE

03:55:23.943 --> 03:55:26.412
BEEN BUILT UP- AND THAT'S GONNA

03:55:26.479 --> 03:55:27.513
BE ANOTHER CRISIS WHICH WE'RE

03:55:27.580 --> 03:55:29.515
GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS. BUT

03:55:29.582 --> 03:55:31.851
IN IN THE MEANWHILE WE HAVE TO

03:55:31.917 --> 03:55:35.921
BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME OF A SENSE

03:55:35.988 --> 03:55:40.025

THAT WE DO WHICH IS- EVEN MORE

03:55:54.306 --> 03:55:55.508
IMPORTANT WHICH IS. THESE

03:55:55.574 --> 03:55:58.310
WRENCHES AND- HOMEOWNERS WILL

BENEFIT FROM THE COVERAGE

03:56:40.586 --> 03:56:43.322
CONTEMPLATED HERE. AGAIN I

03:56:43.389 --> 03:56:45.824
THINK THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THIS

03:56:45.891 --> 03:56:48.093
IN HIS OPENING BUT THAT WAS

03:56:48.160 --> 03:56:51.230
THIS MORNING FROM THE CONTEXT

03:56:51.297 --> 03:56:54.967
OF THIS CRISIS IS UNPRECEDENTED

03:56:55.034 --> 03:56:58.137
WE'VE HAD OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND

03:56:58.203 --> 03:57:01.674
CALIFORNIANS DONE. OVER A

03:57:01.740 --> 03:57:04.443
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND.

03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:07.746
AMERICANS HAVE DIED. THE SCOPE

03:57:07.813 --> 03:57:08.948
OF THIS WE'VE BECOME ALMOST

03:57:09.014 --> 03:57:13.485
NUMB TO THE REALITY- IF THIS

03:57:13.552 --> 03:57:15.521
HAPPENED IN WAR THE NUMBERS

03:57:15.588 --> 03:57:17.923
WOULD BE HUGE IF THIS HAPPENED

03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:19.525
IN ANY OTHER FORM OF NATURAL

03:57:19.592 --> 03:57:22.428
DISASTER THIS WOULD BE HUGE.

03:57:22.494 --> 03:57:25.598
THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCE HAS

03:57:25.664 --> 03:57:29.068
RESULTED IN. HUNDREDS OF

03:57:29.134 --> 03:57:31.203
THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF

03:57:31.270 --> 03:57:33.639
CALIFORNIANS LOSING JOBS. AND

03:57:33.706 --> 03:57:35.474
NOW THE E. D. D. SUPPORT THE

03:57:35.541 --> 03:57:38.844
FEDERAL SUPPORT IS EXHAUSTED

03:57:38.911 --> 03:57:41.714
AND HAS NOT BEEN RENEWED SO

03:57:41.780 --> 03:57:44.617
PEOPLE WHO HAD SOME COMBINATION

03:57:44.683 --> 03:57:47.186
OF EDT MONEY FROM THE STATE AND

03:57:47.252 --> 03:57:49.054
FEDERAL CARES ACT MONEY AND

03:57:49.121 --> 03:57:52.057
THE- UNEMPLOYMENT SUPPLEMENT

03:57:52.124 --> 03:57:56.895
IT'S ALL GONE. SO THE NEXT STEP

03:57:56.962 --> 03:57:59.498
IF YOU'RE HELD TO PAY YOUR RENT.

03:57:59.565 --> 03:58:02.635
AS A FAMILY. AND YOU FACE

03:58:02.701 --> 03:58:08.374
EVICTION. YOU FACE HOMELESSNESS.

03:58:08.440 --> 03:58:10.643
SO THEN ARM AGENCY SERVICES

03:58:10.709 --> 03:58:12.544
WILL HAVE TO CONSTRUCT TENT

03:58:12.611 --> 03:58:17.916
CITIES. REFUGEE CENTERS.

03:58:17.983 --> 03:58:23.789
TAKEOVER SCHOOL GYMS THE HOUSE.

03:58:23.856 --> 03:58:25.391
THOSE THAT WERE UNABLE TO PAY

03:58:25.457 --> 03:58:29.395
RENT. THIS BILL PROVIDES

03:58:29.461 --> 03:58:33.332
TEMPORARY EMERGENCY RELIEF NOT

03:58:33.399 --> 03:58:36.268
JUST FOR TENANTS BUT ALSO FOR

03:58:36.335 --> 03:58:39.772
HOMEOWNERS FOR SMALL LANDLORDS-

03:58:39.838 --> 03:58:41.640
AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO

03:58:41.707 --> 03:58:45.044
TRY TO DEFINE AND EXPAND. AND I

03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:47.980
WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THERE

03:58:48.047 --> 03:58:49.615
ARE SOME WHO WON'T ENJOY THE

03:58:49.682 --> 03:58:52.184
PROTECTION LARGE CORPORATIONS

03:58:52.251 --> 03:58:54.386
INVESTMENT FUNDS THEY ARE

03:58:54.453 --> 03:58:55.954
PERHAPS A BETTER POSITION TO

03:58:56.021 --> 03:58:57.656
GET SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL

03:58:57.723 --> 03:59:00.826
GOVERNMENT AS WAS SHOWN IN THE

03:59:00.893 --> 03:59:02.761
ONE AND ONLY CARES ACT WHERE

03:59:02.828 --> 03:59:06.398
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WENT TO

03:59:06.465 --> 03:59:09.668
BANKING INSTITUTIONS. AND

03:59:09.735 --> 03:59:12.204
CHECKS FOR ONE CHECK FOR TWELVE

03:59:12.271 --> 03:59:15.040
HUNDRED DOLLARS. CAME TO POOR

03:59:15.107 --> 03:59:18.343
WORKING PEOPLE SO THAT'S ALL BY

03:59:18.410 --> 03:59:20.379
WAY OF KIND OF BACKGROUND OF

03:59:20.446 --> 03:59:22.715
THE GRAVITY OF THE CRISIS SO MY

03:59:22.781 --> 03:59:27.052
QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AUTHORS.

03:59:27.119 --> 03:59:30.723
MOM IS. THE RELIEF THAT'S

03:59:30.789 --> 03:59:34.126
PROVIDED IS TEMPORARY IT'S A

03:59:34.193 --> 03:59:38.263
PERIOD OF MONTHS. IN WITH THE

03:59:38.330 --> 03:59:40.666
EXPECTATION AND THE REQUIREMENT

03:59:40.733 --> 03:59:43.502
THAT ANY RENT OWED. OR PAYMENTS

03:59:43.569 --> 03:59:46.839
OWED WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BE

03:59:46.905 --> 03:59:48.640
PAID TO THE LANDLORD TO THE

03:59:48.707 --> 03:59:53.412
BANKING INSTITUTION. IT SETRA.

03:59:53.479 --> 03:59:56.448
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO.

03:59:56.515 --> 03:59:59.885
HOW PEOPLE THAT MAY BENEFIT

03:59:59.952 --> 04:00:01.920
TEMPORARILY ARE SUPPOSED TO

04:00:01.987 --> 04:00:04.823
COME UP WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY

04:00:04.890 --> 04:00:05.324
IF THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY

04:00:05.390 --> 04:00:06.825
EARNING. IF THEY'RE NOT

04:00:06.892 --> 04:00:10.262
CURRENTLY. RECEIVING ANY

04:00:10.329 --> 04:00:12.364
FEDERAL RELIEF. ARE WE JUST

04:00:12.431 --> 04:00:15.400
POSTPONING WHAT'S GONNA BE. THE

04:00:15.467 --> 04:00:19.171
NEXT CRISIS AND DO YOU HAVE ANY

04:00:19.238 --> 04:00:22.241
THOUGHTS ON HOW WE MITIGATE

04:00:22.307 --> 04:00:25.310
THAT HIT SOME AFTER IF THIS

04:00:25.377 --> 04:00:28.413
BILL BECOMES LAW AND RUNS ITS

04:00:28.480 --> 04:00:30.716
COURSE. HOW DO WE PROTECT

04:00:30.783 --> 04:00:35.354
PEOPLE AGAINST THAT CLIFF. SO

04:00:35.420 --> 04:00:36.321
THE QUICK ANSWER TO YOUR

04:00:36.388 --> 04:00:38.357
QUESTION IS I DO HAVE CONCERNS

04:00:38.423 --> 04:00:39.825
AT THIS BILL MAY NOT BE ENOUGH

04:00:39.892 --> 04:00:41.794
EVEN IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED IN

04:00:41.860 --> 04:00:44.563
ITS FULL FORM WHAT WE'RE SAYING

04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:45.164
IS WE GIVE PEOPLE PERIOD OF

04:00:45.230 --> 04:00:47.866
TIME- FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF

04:00:47.933 --> 04:00:51.036
MONTHS TO NOT BE EVICTED SIMPLY

04:00:51.103 --> 04:00:52.070
BECAUSE THEY PAY THE RENT AND

04:00:52.137 --> 04:00:53.338
WE GIVE THEM ANOTHER PERIOD OF

04:00:53.405 --> 04:00:55.274
TIME. TO HOPEFULLY EARN MONEY-

04:00:55.340 --> 04:00:56.275
TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK THE RENT

04:00:56.341 --> 04:00:58.644
AND THEN AT SOME POINT SOON ALL

04:00:58.710 --> 04:01:01.013
THAT THAT IS GOING TO COME OUT

04:01:01.079 --> 04:01:03.615
AND LANDLORDS CAN GO AFTER

04:01:03.682 --> 04:01:05.217
THOSE TENANTS FOR THE FULL

04:01:05.284 --> 04:01:06.451
AMOUNT OF THE RENT I DO WANT TO

04:01:06.518 --> 04:01:12.491
SAY I KNOW. THE ARE THANK THE

04:01:12.558 --> 04:01:14.026
CALIFORNIA PART ASSOCIATION I

04:01:14.092 --> 04:01:14.893
REFERRED TO THIS BILLS ARE.

04:01:14.960 --> 04:01:16.061
STRIKE BILL AND COMMUNICATE TO

04:01:16.128 --> 04:01:16.662
ITS MEMBERS AND I THINK THAT

04:01:16.728 --> 04:01:18.630
CONFUSED A LOT OF MEMBERS. WHO

04:01:18.697 --> 04:01:20.566
ARE COMMUNICATING TODAY BUT

04:01:20.632 --> 04:01:21.166
THAT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

04:01:21.233 --> 04:01:23.035
YOU CAN'T CAMP HERE TO STRIKE.

04:01:23.101 --> 04:01:24.870
IF UNDER THIS BILL WHAT WE'RE

04:01:24.937 --> 04:01:25.838
PROPOSING IS THE TENNIS WILL

04:01:25.904 --> 04:01:29.308
ALL THE RENT. ARE TO YOUR

04:01:29.374 --> 04:01:31.276
POINT. OF THE WEEK IF THE

04:01:31.343 --> 04:01:34.613
COVERT PANT. AND THE RISK.

04:01:34.680 --> 04:01:35.280
DEEPENS WE COULD. QUITE

04:01:35.347 --> 04:01:36.615
CHALLENGE BUT MY SUGGESTION

04:01:36.682 --> 04:01:38.016
HERE IS WE'RE TRYING TO GET IT

04:01:38.083 --> 04:01:39.852
DOWN THE MIDDLE. TO GIVE A

04:01:39.918 --> 04:01:41.920
CHANCE FOR. AT LEAST THE NEXT

04:01:41.987 --> 04:01:43.188
COUPLE OF MONTHS CERTAINLY WHEN

04:01:43.255 --> 04:01:44.223
THIS LEGISLATURE IS NOT IN

04:01:44.289 --> 04:01:46.692
SESSION UNTIL NEXT YEAR- FOR US

04:01:46.758 --> 04:01:48.360
TO NOT SEE A WAVE OF ACTIONS

04:01:48.427 --> 04:01:54.499
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT- YOU

04:01:54.566 --> 04:01:55.767
KNOW. WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE

04:01:55.834 --> 04:01:58.036
AND OTHER SOLUTIONS. I ALSO YOU

04:01:58.103 --> 04:01:58.637
KNOW WANT TO IGNORE THE FACT

04:01:58.704 --> 04:02:00.439
THAT UNDERSTAND THAT IN KNOW AS

04:02:00.505 --> 04:02:01.440
WE LOOK. TO BEFORE. IF FEDERAL

04:02:01.506 --> 04:02:02.875
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T COME TO OUR

04:02:02.941 --> 04:02:04.343
RESCUE WE MAY NEED TO THINK

04:02:04.409 --> 04:02:06.578
ABOUT OTHER SOURCES OF RUNNING.

04:02:06.645 --> 04:02:08.480
I KNOW THERE'S A SUGGESTION OF

04:02:08.547 --> 04:02:09.781
POTENTIALLY TWELVE BILLION

04:02:09.848 --> 04:02:11.950
DOLLARS OF STATE GOVERNMENT TAX

04:02:12.017 --> 04:02:14.419
CREDITS. TO BENEFIT LANDLORDS-

04:02:14.486 --> 04:02:15.921
THE WHICH IS A BILL THAT. THIS

04:02:15.988 --> 04:02:17.456
BODY CONSIDERED AND I WANT TO

04:02:17.522 --> 04:02:19.024
SAY THAT. I VOTED IN SUPPORT OF

04:02:19.091 --> 04:02:21.159
SB FOURTEEN TENS APPROACH. AS

04:02:21.226 --> 04:02:22.461
POTENTIALLY COMPLEMENTARY TO

04:02:22.527 --> 04:02:23.862
WHAT WE'RE DOING. BUT AGAIN

04:02:23.929 --> 04:02:25.931
WITH A FIFTY FOUR BILLION

04:02:25.998 --> 04:02:26.832
BUDGET DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT.

04:02:26.899 --> 04:02:29.034
IT'S UNCERTAIN WHETHER WE AS A

04:02:29.101 --> 04:02:30.502
STATE. WOULD BE ABLE TO.

04:02:30.569 --> 04:02:32.604
WITHSTAND THAT FINANCIAL HIT.

SO AGAIN LOOKING FOR IDEAS- BUT

04:02:35.607 --> 04:02:37.409
YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR POINT. WE

04:02:37.476 --> 04:02:38.310
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE MAY

04:02:38.377 --> 04:02:40.879
BRING AND IF THE FUTURE

04:02:40.946 --> 04:02:41.413
CONTINUES POORLY WE COULD

04:02:41.480 --> 04:02:44.416

WHICH TO ME THIS BILL

04:02:58.030 --> 04:03:00.999
REPRESENTS. A BUT I THINK IT'S

04:03:01.066 --> 04:03:04.136
IMPERATIVE. TO CONTINUE TO

04:03:04.202 --> 04:03:06.872
POINT OUT THE NEED FOR FEDERAL

04:03:06.939 --> 04:03:09.341

THAN FULL RENT FROM THIS BILL

04:03:38.971 --> 04:03:40.672

04:09:49.107 --> 04:09:50.842
SUM. WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT

04:09:50.909 --> 04:09:52.410
SO WE CAN'T DO THAT THE FEDERAL

04:09:52.477 --> 04:09:55.013
GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY SAID

04:09:55.080 --> 04:09:55.847
THAT YOU CAN'T TO LUMP SUMS.

04:09:55.914 --> 04:09:57.248
BUT IT DEFINITELY ONE OF THE

04:09:57.315 --> 04:09:58.717
THINGS WE WANTED TO DO SO THAT

04:09:58.783 --> 04:10:00.051
THIS WASN'T A QUESTION IN TERMS

04:10:00.118 --> 04:10:04.823
OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION. WAS

04:10:04.889 --> 04:10:05.323
MAKE SURE THAT THE BANK

04:10:05.390 --> 04:10:06.358
INTERCOM. WOULD DISCLOSE THEIR

04:10:06.424 --> 04:10:07.892
PAYMENT BECAUSE WE CAN'T THE

04:10:07.959 --> 04:10:09.060
STATE CALIFORNIA CAN'T TELL

04:10:09.127 --> 04:10:10.228
BANKS HOW TO RESTRUCTURE THOSE

04:10:10.295 --> 04:10:14.165
PAYMENTS. BUT OKAY SO WE

04:10:14.232 --> 04:10:15.800
UNDERSTAND THOUGH THAT THE

04:10:15.867 --> 04:10:18.737
BANKS. ARE GOING TO WANT TO GET

04:10:18.803 --> 04:10:22.140
THEIR MONEY BACK RIGHT SO.

04:10:22.207 --> 04:10:23.208
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THAT'S

04:10:23.274 --> 04:10:24.476
PROBABLY HOW THEY WOULD

04:10:24.542 --> 04:10:26.211
STRUCTURE THAT SORT OF IF

04:10:26.277 --> 04:10:28.813
STATEMENTS ARE A FEDERALLY

04:10:28.880 --> 04:10:30.215
BACKED LOAN AT THE MOMENT THEY

04:10:30.281 --> 04:10:31.683
CANNOT DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S

04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:33.885
WHAT THE CARES ACT SPECIFIES

04:10:33.952 --> 04:10:36.588
OKAY SO NOW IF THEY'RE NON

04:10:36.654 --> 04:10:37.422
FEDERALLY. BACKED LOAN WHICH WE

04:10:37.489 --> 04:10:39.057
HAD MAYBE THIRTY PLUS

04:10:39.124 --> 04:10:40.759
PERCENTAGE HERE IN THE STATE OF

04:10:40.825 --> 04:10:41.593
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT

04:10:41.659 --> 04:10:42.761
FEDERALLY BANK WHAT WE'RE

04:10:42.827 --> 04:10:46.431
ASKING THEM TO DO IS TO

04:10:46.498 --> 04:10:50.735
DISCLOSE IT UP FRONT. WE'RE

04:10:50.802 --> 04:10:52.437
BASICALLY PARALLELING THE

04:10:52.504 --> 04:10:54.873
CARERS ACT WITH THESE BANKS

04:10:54.939 --> 04:10:56.074
FEDERALLY BACKED YES FOR

04:10:56.141 --> 04:10:58.843
FEDERALLY BACKED UP FOR STATE

04:10:58.910 --> 04:11:00.078
BACKED LOANS WE CAN DO BETTER.

04:11:00.145 --> 04:11:01.246
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SUBJECT TO

04:11:01.312 --> 04:11:03.214
THE FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND

04:11:03.281 --> 04:11:04.916
WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO JUST TO

04:11:04.983 --> 04:11:06.684
BE BETTER IT'S REALLY CHEST

04:11:06.751 --> 04:11:08.520
GIVE CONSUMERS THAT ADVANCE

04:11:08.586 --> 04:11:11.456
NOTICE. THE GONNA HAVE THE SAME

04:11:11.523 --> 04:11:14.292
PROTECTIONS AND WE AS A STATE

04:11:14.359 --> 04:11:15.693
BECAUSE OF OUR CONCERN ABOUT

04:11:15.760 --> 04:11:17.829
CONSUMER PROTECTION WILL ALSO

04:11:17.896 --> 04:11:19.531
GIVE THEM NOTICE WOULD LIKE THE

04:11:19.597 --> 04:11:20.532
FEDS TO DO IT TOO BUT WE KNOW

04:11:20.598 --> 04:11:22.567
WE CAN'T ORDER THEM. SO FOR

04:11:22.634 --> 04:11:24.502
THAT FOR THIS FOR THE STATE

04:11:24.569 --> 04:11:29.174
BACKED LOANS THE STATE CAN SAY-

04:11:29.240 --> 04:11:31.609
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK FOR

04:11:31.676 --> 04:11:33.244
ALL THE MONEY UP FRONT OR YOU

04:11:33.311 --> 04:11:35.413
MUST ASK FOR IT ALL AT FOR A

04:11:35.480 --> 04:11:36.314
DIMINISHING DO ANYTHING WE WANT

04:11:36.381 --> 04:11:37.682
CORRECT FOR THE STATE BACKED

04:11:37.749 --> 04:11:39.851
LOANS. NOT NECESSARILY THE

04:11:39.918 --> 04:11:41.820
STATE I MEAN THIS IS IT THIS IS

04:11:41.886 --> 04:11:45.223
AN ASPECT WHERE NO STATE- THESE

04:11:45.290 --> 04:11:46.424
ARE PRIVATELY BANKS BANK

04:11:46.491 --> 04:11:48.159
MONTHLY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

04:11:48.226 --> 04:11:50.395
STATE BACKED LOANS- AND SO WE

04:11:50.462 --> 04:11:52.530
CAN'T TELL THEM. HOW MUCH TO

04:11:52.597 --> 04:11:54.432
CHARGE AND WHAT MONTHS BUT WE

04:11:54.499 --> 04:11:55.967
CAN PUT A CONSUMER PROTECTION

04:11:56.034 --> 04:11:58.036
IN SAYING THAT IF A LOT OF SUN

04:11:58.102 --> 04:11:59.003
IS WHAT THEY'RE OFFERING THAT

04:11:59.070 --> 04:12:00.638
NEEDS TO BE EXPLICITLY

04:12:00.705 --> 04:12:03.174
DISCLOSED. TO THAT PROPERTY

04:12:03.241 --> 04:12:05.777
OWNER- AND THEN THAT WAY THE

04:12:05.844 --> 04:12:07.412
INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE A DECISION

04:12:07.479 --> 04:12:08.413
IF THE FORBEARANCE IS GOING TO

04:12:08.480 --> 04:12:10.081
WORK FOR THEM OR NOT. BUT WE

04:12:10.148 --> 04:12:12.183
ARE TRYING TO MAKE AS MUCH AS

04:12:12.250 --> 04:12:16.488
WE CAN- THE CARES ACT. I COULD

04:12:16.554 --> 04:12:18.857
TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS. CENTER

04:12:18.923 --> 04:12:19.958
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY WHICH IS.

04:12:20.024 --> 04:12:21.526
UNDER FEDERAL LAW FEDS HAVE

04:12:21.593 --> 04:12:23.161
SAID. IF YOU HAVE A FEDERALLY

04:12:23.228 --> 04:12:24.929
BACKED LOAN YOU GET UP TO A

04:12:24.996 --> 04:12:26.264
YEAR FOR PARENTS THE INDUSTRY

04:12:26.331 --> 04:12:27.665
KNOWS THAT AS A STANDARD. WHAT

04:12:27.732 --> 04:12:29.033
THE BANKING INDUSTRY WILL TELL

04:12:29.100 --> 04:12:30.001
YOU FOR NON FEDERALLY BACKED

04:12:30.068 --> 04:12:32.537
LOANS IN CALIFORNIA. IS BAY

04:12:32.604 --> 04:12:34.138
BELIEVE THEY CAN ROUGHLY MIMIC

04:12:34.205 --> 04:12:35.707
WHAT IS BEING REQUIRED FOR

04:12:35.773 --> 04:12:36.741
FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS. TO

04:12:36.808 --> 04:12:38.476
ANOTHER IS TO FOR POTENTIALLY A

04:12:38.543 --> 04:12:40.011
TWO YEAR. WHAT WE'RE SAYING

04:12:40.078 --> 04:12:41.913
WITH THIS BILL AS WE WANT TO

04:12:41.980 --> 04:12:44.682
GIVE HOMEOWNERS AND PROPERTY

04:12:44.749 --> 04:12:45.750
OWNERS UP TO A YEAR. AND THAT

04:12:45.817 --> 04:12:46.885
GIVES SOME BREATHING ROOM FOR

04:12:46.951 --> 04:12:48.820
THE TENANT TO HAVE UP TO YEAR

04:12:48.887 --> 04:12:49.888
TO PAY WE'RE TRYING TO. WE'RE

04:12:49.954 --> 04:12:50.889
TRYING TO CREATE A WATERFALL

04:12:50.955 --> 04:12:54.392
EFFECT SO IT WORKS. NOW IT MAY

04:12:54.459 --> 04:12:56.261
NOT WORK ENTIRELY CORRECT

04:12:56.327 --> 04:12:57.695
TWELVE MONTHS OF NOT PAYING

04:12:57.762 --> 04:12:59.597
RENT IT MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME TO

04:12:59.664 --> 04:13:00.732
MAKE SURE THAT TWELVE MONTHS OF

04:13:00.798 --> 04:13:02.767
MORTGAGE GETS PAID BUT I THINK

04:13:02.834 --> 04:13:04.102
IT WORKS AN AWFUL LOT BETTER

04:13:04.168 --> 04:13:06.204
THAN DOING NOTHING BECAUSE IF

04:13:06.271 --> 04:13:08.373
WE DO NOTHING IN TWO WEEKS THAT

04:13:08.439 --> 04:13:09.541
LANDLORDS GOING TO HAVE TO

04:13:09.607 --> 04:13:10.909
BRING EXPENSIVE ADDICTION

04:13:10.975 --> 04:13:12.610
ACTION TO KICK OUT THE TENANT

04:13:12.677 --> 04:13:15.179
AND YOU CAN ASK LANDLORDS IF

04:13:15.246 --> 04:13:16.347
YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE ABLE TO

04:13:16.414 --> 04:13:18.283
GET THEIR UNPAID RENT FROM THAT

04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:20.685
OF FICTION. EVICTION ACTIONS

04:13:20.752 --> 04:13:21.986
ARE USED TO GET YOUR PROPERTY

04:13:22.053 --> 04:13:24.222
BACK TO KICK PEOPLE UP IN ST

04:13:24.289 --> 04:13:26.190
BUT THEY'RE VERY INEFFECTIVE

04:13:26.257 --> 04:13:27.392
ACTUALLY GETTING YOUR UNPAID

04:13:27.458 --> 04:13:29.761
RENT SO IF WE A LOT OF ACTIONS

04:13:29.827 --> 04:13:31.195
TO HELP INSURE YOU'LL KICK OUT

04:13:31.262 --> 04:13:32.163
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

04:13:32.230 --> 04:13:34.566
TENANTS ON TO THE STREETS AND

04:13:34.632 --> 04:13:35.967
ALL THAT THAT HAS AN IMPACT BUT

04:13:36.034 --> 04:13:37.735
THOSE LANDLORDS WILL LIKELY NOT

04:13:37.802 --> 04:13:39.504
BE ABLE TO GET A PORTION OF

04:13:39.571 --> 04:13:40.638
THAT ON THE FRONT SO THEY WILL

04:13:40.705 --> 04:13:41.639
BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE

04:13:41.706 --> 04:13:44.175
ANYWAY ALL WE'RE SAYING IS GET.

04:13:44.242 --> 04:13:45.877
TENANTS SOMETIME LET'S GIVE

04:13:45.944 --> 04:13:48.513
PROPERTY OWNERS HOMEOWNERS AND

04:13:48.580 --> 04:13:51.082
LANDLORDS SOMETIME SO THAT WE

04:13:51.149 --> 04:13:53.151
GET WE HOPEFULLY THE PANDEMIC

04:13:53.217 --> 04:13:55.620
SLOWS DOWN THE RECESSION ENDS

04:13:55.687 --> 04:13:56.754
WE GET EVERYBODY BACK ON THEIR

04:13:56.821 --> 04:13:59.724
FEET AND EVERYBODY'S MADE WHOLE

04:13:59.791 --> 04:14:06.965
BILL WOULD REQUIRE. FOR

04:14:07.031 --> 04:14:08.399
EVERYONE TO BE MADE WHOLE.

04:14:08.466 --> 04:14:09.400
MARTIN IF I MAY ADD. IS THE-

04:14:09.467 --> 04:14:11.703
PRESS HAS NOT. PAYMENT AT THE

04:14:11.769 --> 04:14:12.437
END OF THE MORTGAGE SO IF YOU

04:14:12.503 --> 04:14:14.072
WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT MONTHS

04:14:14.138 --> 04:14:16.941
AND NOT THEN SO IF IT'S NOT OF

04:14:17.008 --> 04:14:17.809
A FEDERALLY BUT IF YOU'RE

04:14:17.875 --> 04:14:19.010
SAYING NO THEN YOU CLEARLY HAVE

04:14:19.077 --> 04:14:21.079
SOME EXAMPLES BUT THE OVERALL

04:14:21.145 --> 04:14:23.114
PRACTICES BAND THAT THEY ARE

04:14:23.181 --> 04:14:25.016
ADDING IT SO INSTEAD OF A

04:14:25.083 --> 04:14:25.984
HUNDRED EIGHT MONTHS LEFT

04:14:26.050 --> 04:14:29.087
YOU'RE NOW AT A HUNDRED. AND

04:14:29.153 --> 04:14:31.255
YOU KNOW TWENTY MONTHS LEFT I

04:14:31.322 --> 04:14:32.190
DON'T THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY

04:14:32.256 --> 04:14:35.727
WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT THANK YOU.

04:14:35.793 --> 04:14:36.861
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED

04:14:36.928 --> 04:14:38.997
WHEN WE CALLED OUR BANK TO

04:14:39.063 --> 04:14:40.865
INQUIRE ABOUT THIS AND THEY

04:14:40.932 --> 04:14:42.900
SAID WE ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE

04:14:42.967 --> 04:14:44.736
YOU A FORBEARANCE OF RIGHT KIND

04:14:44.802 --> 04:14:45.737
AND THAT THEY SAID THREE FOUR

04:14:45.803 --> 04:14:47.805
MONTHS WHATEVER. BUT YOU ARE

04:14:47.872 --> 04:14:49.607
EXPECTED TO PAY THAT BACK IN

04:14:49.674 --> 04:14:53.578
FULL. AT THE END OF THAT TERM.

04:14:53.645 --> 04:14:54.946
SO HOW DOES THAT HELP SOMEONE

04:14:55.013 --> 04:14:56.180
YEAH YOU DON'T HAVE A FEDERALLY

04:14:56.247 --> 04:14:57.715
BACKED. MORTGAGE THAT WHAT THAT

04:14:57.782 --> 04:15:00.685
IS SAID PRIVATE MORTGAGE RIGHT.

04:15:00.752 --> 04:15:02.153
OKAY I'M USING THIS AS AN

04:15:02.220 --> 04:15:04.489
EXAMPLE OF WHEN WE WERE

04:15:04.555 --> 04:15:05.690
ENQUIRING TWO ONE OF OUR LOCAL

04:15:05.757 --> 04:15:09.460
BANKS SO. I DON'T. I DON'T

04:15:09.527 --> 04:15:10.928
THINK THIS IS WORKING THE WAY

04:15:10.995 --> 04:15:12.230
YOU THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO

04:15:12.296 --> 04:15:14.198
WORK BUT LET ME MOVE ON BECAUSE

04:15:14.265 --> 04:15:15.600
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO IT YET

04:15:15.667 --> 04:15:16.434
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE OTHERS WHO

04:15:16.501 --> 04:15:18.569
WANT US MAKING THANK THANK YOU

04:15:18.636 --> 04:15:21.472
MADAM CHAIR. SO THERE'S- A

04:15:21.539 --> 04:15:23.241
SEVERABILITY CLAUSE IN THIS

04:15:23.307 --> 04:15:25.476
BILL. BECAUSE WE TALKED EARLIER

04:15:25.543 --> 04:15:27.311
ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF

04:15:27.378 --> 04:15:29.313
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS BILL.

04:15:29.380 --> 04:15:31.049
SO IF THIS BILL OF THE PORTIONS

04:15:31.115 --> 04:15:33.418
OF THE BILL RELATING TO THE

04:15:33.484 --> 04:15:34.652
FORBEARANCE GET STRICKEN.

04:15:34.719 --> 04:15:37.321
STRICKEN DOWN IN COURT. WHAT IS

04:15:37.388 --> 04:15:39.390
STILL STANDING IS THE PART THAT

04:15:39.457 --> 04:15:39.957
SAYS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY

04:15:40.024 --> 04:15:43.594
RENT. DURING THIS PANDEMIC SO

04:15:43.661 --> 04:15:44.629
THEN WHAT HAPPENS. TO THE

04:15:44.696 --> 04:15:46.664
PEOPLE WHO. HAVE TO PAY THE

04:15:46.731 --> 04:15:50.334
MORTGAGE. WELL AGAIN OUR

04:15:50.401 --> 04:15:52.336
ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT IS BEST

04:15:52.403 --> 04:15:54.972
FOR EVERYONE TO NOT SEE A HUGE

04:15:55.039 --> 04:15:56.174
GENERATION OF RENTERS KICKED

04:15:56.240 --> 04:15:57.341
OUT ON THE STREETS BECAUSE IF

04:15:57.408 --> 04:15:58.876
THAT HAPPENS THOSE ONES ARE NOT

04:15:58.943 --> 04:15:59.644
GONNA GET PAID ON THOSE

04:15:59.711 --> 04:16:01.979
MORTGAGES WILL NEVER HAVE A

04:16:02.046 --> 04:16:03.448
SHOT AT GETTING PAID OFF THEIR-

04:16:03.514 --> 04:16:04.582
MORTGAGE IS PAID BY LANDLORDS

04:16:04.649 --> 04:16:08.619
NO I UNDERSTAND BUT I'M I'M-ASKING YOU SERIOUSLY HAVE YOU.

04:16:08.686 --> 04:16:09.787
CONTEMPLATED ALL THE DIFFERENT

04:16:09.854 --> 04:16:13.324
WAYS THIS COULD TURN OUT IF

04:16:13.391 --> 04:16:14.692
THIS DOESN'T STANDING

04:16:14.759 --> 04:16:16.360
QUARTERBACK PORTION OF THE BILL

04:16:16.427 --> 04:16:17.361
DOESN'T STAND IN COURT THEN

04:16:17.428 --> 04:16:18.629
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO

04:16:18.696 --> 04:16:19.630
AREN'T PAYING RENT BECAUSE WE

04:16:19.697 --> 04:16:21.132
PUT A LOT OF PLACES YOU DON'T

04:16:21.199 --> 04:16:22.867
HAVE TO PAY RENT. BUT THE

04:16:22.934 --> 04:16:25.203
PROPERTY OWNER STILL HAS TO PAY

04:16:25.269 --> 04:16:27.371
THE MORTGAGE BUT THEY'RE NOT

04:16:27.438 --> 04:16:29.006
GETTING THE RENT SO THEN THEY

POTENTIAL SUGGESTION IF THAT IS

04:24:31.222 --> 04:24:32.289
GOING TO BE ON FROM ILLEGAL

04:24:32.356 --> 04:24:34.058

OTHERS WHO MIGHT BE A LITTLE

04:24:38.262 --> 04:24:39.063
CONFUSED WHERE THIS

04:24:39.129 --> 04:24:40.164
CONVERSATION'S GOING HERE'S THE

04:24:40.231 --> 04:24:41.065
CHALLENGE FOR TRYING TO STATE

04:24:41.131 --> 04:24:42.933
WHICH IS THE GOVERNMENT EARLIER

04:24:43.000 --> 04:24:44.535
THIS YEAR SAID. FEDERALLY

04:24:44.602 --> 04:24:45.669
BACKED MORTGAGES YES YOU GET

04:24:45.736 --> 04:24:48.872
PARENTS THROUGH THE END OF

04:24:48.939 --> 04:24:49.840
DECEMBER. AND OUR THE DECISION

04:24:49.907 --> 04:24:50.708
THAT THEY DID NOT MAKE A RULING

04:24:50.774 --> 04:24:52.109
ON NON FEDERALLY BACKED

04:24:52.176 --> 04:24:53.844
MORTGAGES SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING

04:24:53.911 --> 04:24:55.713
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS WE

04:24:55.779 --> 04:24:57.348
WANT TO CREATE SOME. BETWEEN

04:24:57.414 --> 04:24:59.083
FEDERAL NOT. AND WE WANT TO DO

04:24:59.149 --> 04:25:00.651
THAT THROUGH FOR ANOTHER EXTRA

04:25:00.718 --> 04:25:01.585
THREE MONTHS AND SO THERE'S

04:25:01.652 --> 04:25:03.754
THIS ISSUE OF THE DATE. AND HOW

04:25:03.821 --> 04:25:05.122
TO DRIVE THIS NOW WHAT WE SEE

04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:06.890
IN THIS BILL. IS WHEN IT COMES

04:25:06.957 --> 04:25:07.925
TO FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES

04:25:07.992 --> 04:25:09.460
THE FEDERAL. REGULATORY

04:25:09.526 --> 04:25:10.794
STRUCTURE OUGHT TO APPLY THAT'S

04:25:10.861 --> 04:25:12.496
THE SAFE HARBOR ISSUE. BUT

04:25:12.563 --> 04:25:13.764
THERE'S THIS OPEN QUESTION OF

04:25:13.831 --> 04:25:14.798
WHAT HAPPENS FROM NON FEDERALLY

04:25:14.865 --> 04:25:16.567
BACKED. DURING THIS EXTRA TIME

04:25:16.634 --> 04:25:18.769
PERIOD AND WE'VE- MADE OUR BEST

04:25:18.836 --> 04:25:20.437
ASSESSMENT THAT. WE SHOULD BE

04:25:20.504 --> 04:25:21.672
ABLE TO DO THIS IS A LOT OF

04:25:21.739 --> 04:25:23.040
DISCUSSION ABOUT MAKING SURE WE

04:25:23.107 --> 04:25:24.408
HAVE. A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BUT

04:25:24.475 --> 04:25:26.210
THE REALITY IS RIGHT NOW. THERE

04:25:26.277 --> 04:25:29.213
IS NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD

04:25:29.280 --> 04:25:29.713
BECAUSE FEDERALLY BACKED

04:25:29.780 --> 04:25:32.750
MORTGAGES HAVE. THE FULL FAITH-AND CREDIT OF THE FENCE BEHIND

04:25:32.816 --> 04:25:33.784
THEM. BUT THESE OTHERS DON'T SO

04:25:33.851 --> 04:25:35.219
WE'RE LITERALLY JUST TRYING TO

04:25:35.286 --> 04:25:36.320
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AS BEST

04:25:36.387 --> 04:25:38.022
WE CAN. BUT TO GET TO STAR

04:25:38.088 --> 04:25:39.890
WHITE HOUSE KEYS POINT. IN YOU

04:25:39.957 --> 04:25:41.125
KNOW SIX WERE REFERS TO THE

04:25:41.191 --> 04:25:42.760
FACT THAT. IF YOU RESTRUCTURE

04:25:42.826 --> 04:25:44.461
THIS IN A WAY THAT NESTS THE

04:25:44.528 --> 04:25:45.396
DEFERRED PAYMENT PROGRAM

04:25:45.462 --> 04:25:46.930
WITHIN. THE NON JUDICIAL

04:25:46.997 --> 04:25:48.032
FORECLOSURE PROCESS IN MY PM

04:25:48.098 --> 04:25:49.533
STRONG LEGAL FOOTING WE ARE

04:25:49.600 --> 04:25:50.801
VERY SERIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT

04:25:50.868 --> 04:25:52.002
RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE IN

04:25:52.069 --> 04:25:53.237
DISCUSSIONS. WITH THE BANKING

04:25:53.304 --> 04:25:56.573
INDUSTRY DIRECTLY ABOUT THESE

04:25:56.640 --> 04:25:58.275
THESE POINTS SO. STATE I'M I

04:25:58.342 --> 04:26:00.210
MIGHT ALSO SUGGEST. THAT OF

04:26:00.277 --> 04:26:01.945
HOPEFULLY THE FEDERAL

04:26:02.012 --> 04:26:03.681
GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO EXTEND-

04:26:03.747 --> 04:26:05.616
IF THEY CAN GET BACK TOGETHER

04:26:05.683 --> 04:26:07.051
AND- COME TO AGREEMENT ON

04:26:07.117 --> 04:26:09.620
ANYTHING- TO EXTEND THE CARERS

04:26:09.687 --> 04:26:10.754
ACT. OR AT LEAST SOME

04:26:10.821 --> 04:26:12.990
PROVISIONS OF IT. SO THAT. IT

04:26:13.057 --> 04:26:15.626
THEN WE WILL BE IN SYNC- BUT

04:26:15.693 --> 04:26:17.394
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO ANTICIPATE

04:26:17.461 --> 04:26:18.529
TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

04:26:18.595 --> 04:26:20.798
DO EXCEPT TO SAY. HEY LOOK

04:26:20.864 --> 04:26:22.333

04:26:22.399 --> 04:26:24.601
IDEA TO. EXTENDED OUT FURTHER

04:26:24.668 --> 04:26:26.637
AND THE STATE THEN WILL BE- IN

04:26:26.704 --> 04:26:29.440
PARALLELS. SINK SYNCHRONIZATION

04:26:29.506 --> 04:26:32.076
WITH THEM. I HAVE A QUESTION

04:26:32.142 --> 04:26:33.544
FOR SOME REALLY ON. MY

COLLEAGUE HERE FROM FRESNO WAS

SIX HUNDRED BUCKS EXTERNAL THAT

04:26:52.896 --> 04:26:54.932

GOING TO CHANGE- AND THAT WILL

04:27:16.754 --> 04:27:18.188
CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IF

THAT TYPE OF WAY AND I THINK

04:29:09.766 --> 04:29:11.168
FUNDAMENTALLY ADS WERE HAVING

04:29:11.235 --> 04:29:12.836

ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS-

04:29:15.572 --> 04:29:17.674
THIS BILL INDEPENDENT OF THIS

PAY THEIRMORTGAGE SO WE'RE

04:29:33.524 --> 04:29:35.559

THEM MORE TIME. NO MAN MADAM

04:29:37.361 --> 04:29:39.096

SHOCKING IS IT. EXTENDED TALK.

04:31:10.454 --> 04:31:11.955
UNPRECEDENTED NATURE LET'S JUST

04:31:12.022 --> 04:31:13.590
SAY OF PURSUING THIS KIND OF

04:31:13.657 --> 04:31:16.026
REMEDY FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE NO

04:31:16.093 --> 04:31:17.027
OTHER RECOURSE BUT HEY I THINK

04:31:17.094 --> 04:31:20.197
THAT- IF I HAVE ANY CONCERN

04:31:20.263 --> 04:31:22.866
HERE- IT IS IN OUR LIMITS OF

04:31:22.933 --> 04:31:26.536
STATE LAW. AND THAT WE DO HAVE

04:31:26.603 --> 04:31:28.705
TO TAKE A CHANCE AND DO WE HAVE

04:31:28.772 --> 04:31:32.776
TO. SORT OF MAKE A BET HERE

04:31:32.843 --> 04:31:35.746
THAT EVENTUALLY- THE FEDERAL

04:31:35.812 --> 04:31:38.281
GOVERNMENT'S GONNA STEP IN AND

04:31:38.348 --> 04:31:40.851
REALLY FIND A WAY TO. MEET

NEED TO BELIEVE THE MARKETS I

04:31:49.459 --> 04:31:50.927
THINK THE RESERVISTS BEEN DOING

04:31:50.994 --> 04:31:52.295
THEIR PART BUT I THINK CONGRESS

04:31:52.362 --> 04:31:54.865
HAS GOT ACT I JUST- I

04:31:54.931 --> 04:31:56.166
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING

04:31:56.233 --> 04:31:57.334
TO DO IN THE EVOLVING NATURE

04:31:57.401 --> 04:32:00.437
THIS PROPOSAL. I DO HOPE THAT-

04:32:00.504 --> 04:32:02.072
GIVEN A COMPRESSED TIMELINE ON

04:32:02.139 --> 04:32:04.241
WHAT THIS NEGOTIATION HAS TO BE

04:32:04.307 --> 04:32:07.244
IN ORDER TO GET THINGS DONE-

04:32:07.310 --> 04:32:09.346
BEFORE OUR EVICTION DEADLINE

04:32:09.413 --> 04:32:12.649
HITS THAT YOU WILL- CONTINUE TO

KEEP THIS COMMITTEE A PRIZE I

04:32:14.151 --> 04:32:15.152
HAVE A LOT OF TRUST IN OUR

04:32:15.218 --> 04:32:17.454
CHAIR AND- THE STAFF HERE BUT I

04:32:17.521 --> 04:32:19.556
KNOW THAT- THIS IS GOING TO GO

04:32:19.623 --> 04:32:24.795
FAST. SO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT

04:32:24.861 --> 04:32:25.562
WHAT THE SORT OF KEY MOVING

04:32:25.629 --> 04:32:27.264
PIECES ARE GOING TO BE IN MY

04:32:27.330 --> 04:32:30.467
SENSE IS THAT THE- D. THE

04:32:30.534 --> 04:32:33.870
LENDING COMMUNITY AND- AND THE

04:32:33.937 --> 04:32:36.807
LANDLORDS ARE BOTH- WILLING TO

04:32:36.873 --> 04:32:37.808
COME TO THE TABLE I MEAN I'VE

04:32:37.874 --> 04:32:40.777
HEARD. REPEATEDLY CALLS FOR TAX

04:32:40.844 --> 04:32:42.479
CREDITS OR SOME KIND OF TAX

04:32:42.546 --> 04:32:45.782
WRITE OFF OPTION- FOR THOSE WHO

04:32:45.849 --> 04:32:48.418
ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFILL THE

04:32:48.485 --> 04:32:50.353
TERMS OF THEIR MORTGAGE- AND BE

04:32:50.420 --> 04:32:51.455
ABLE TO WRITE THAT OFF AS AN

04:32:51.521 --> 04:32:52.622
EXPENSE OR FIND SOME OTHER

04:32:52.689 --> 04:32:54.124
RECOURSE I THINK THAT'S A

04:32:54.191 --> 04:32:54.925
REASONABLE OPTION TO HAVE ON

04:32:54.991 --> 04:32:57.461
THE TABLE AND I HOPE THAT THAT-

04:32:57.527 --> 04:33:00.230
IS THOUGHT OF IN IN CONJUNCTION

04:33:00.297 --> 04:33:02.332
WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF THIS

04:33:02.399 --> 04:33:05.035
TENET. RELIEF FRAMEWORK I THINK

04:33:05.102 --> 04:33:06.903
THEY'RE BOTH NECESSARY. I WOULD

04:33:06.970 --> 04:33:09.172
ALSO JUST ADD THOUGH THAT- NOT

04:33:09.239 --> 04:33:12.275
OLD BANKS ARE CREATED THE SAME.

04:33:12.342 --> 04:33:14.211
AND I EAT I DO WONDER IF YOU

04:33:14.277 --> 04:33:16.546
ALL GIVEN THOUGHT TO- THE

04:33:16.613 --> 04:33:18.482
COMMUNITY BANKS AND SOME OF OUR

04:33:18.548 --> 04:33:20.517
LOCAL CREDIT UNIONS WHO. MAY

04:33:20.584 --> 04:33:23.687
BE- WITHIN THEIR PORTFOLIO HAVE

04:33:23.754 --> 04:33:26.957
A- A LARGER RANGE OF THE KIND

04:33:27.023 --> 04:33:28.825
OF. LOANS THAT WE'RE TALKING

04:33:28.892 --> 04:33:32.062
ABOUT HERE THAT. THAT MACY GOOD

04:33:32.129 --> 04:33:34.664
DAY KIND OF FORBEARANCE- THAT'S

04:33:34.731 --> 04:33:35.866
ALLOWED BY THIS LEGISLATION

04:33:35.932 --> 04:33:37.134
REALLY WHAT WE DO IN THOSE

04:33:37.200 --> 04:33:40.637
THOSECASES- WE DON'T. WE KNOW

04:33:40.704 --> 04:33:41.972
THAT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT

04:33:42.038 --> 04:33:43.306
OPERATING MODEL AND CERTAINLY

04:33:43.373 --> 04:33:45.675
DIFFERENT PROFIT MODELS- AND

04:33:45.742 --> 04:33:46.543
ONE THAT'S MEMBER DRIVEN ON THE

04:33:46.610 --> 04:33:48.578
STUDY SHAREHOLDER DRIVEN SO. WE

04:33:48.645 --> 04:33:49.379
KNOW IT'S SORT OF A DIFFERENT

04:33:49.446 --> 04:33:51.214
SET OF MOTIVES. CAN YOU CAN

04:33:51.281 --> 04:33:52.783
EITHER I'M NOT SURE WHICH OF

04:33:52.849 --> 04:33:54.684
THE AUTHORS ARE BETTER.

04:33:54.751 --> 04:33:57.521
SITUATED AND- WHICHEVER GIVE IT

04:33:57.587 --> 04:33:58.822
GIVE US SOME INSIGHT ON THAT

04:33:58.889 --> 04:34:00.724
ISSUE BUT I WAS HOPING YOU

04:34:00.791 --> 04:34:01.758
COULD TALK ABOUT. THAT UNIQUE

04:34:01.825 --> 04:34:04.094
ENVIRONMENT. HELLO START ANSWER

04:34:04.161 --> 04:34:05.829
TO THAT QUESTION SO. AS WE WERE

04:34:05.896 --> 04:34:07.564
CONTEMPLATING ADDING MORTGAGE

04:34:07.631 --> 04:34:09.399
FORBEARANCE PROVISIONS- ONE OF

04:34:09.466 --> 04:34:11.234
THE FIRST. STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE

04:34:11.301 --> 04:34:12.035
REACH OUT TO WHERE THE CREDIT

04:34:12.102 --> 04:34:13.670
UNIONS ARE TO TALK ABOUT THIS

04:34:13.737 --> 04:34:16.173
AND WE'VE HAD. AS ON PAGE

04:34:16.239 --> 04:34:17.007
SIXTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS-

04:34:17.073 --> 04:34:18.842
DESCRIBES THE AUTHOR'S REPORT.

04:34:18.909 --> 04:34:20.076
A HEALTHY BACK AND FORTH WITH

04:34:20.143 --> 04:34:21.511
THE CREDIT UNIONS OVER A

04:34:21.578 --> 04:34:23.146
POSSIBLE EXEMPTION FOR THE

04:34:23.213 --> 04:34:24.281
BILL- AND IT LAYS OUT A COUPLE

04:34:24.347 --> 04:34:26.917
THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN.

04:34:26.983 --> 04:34:28.218
WRESTLER WITH. ONE OPTION WOULD

04:34:28.285 --> 04:34:29.753
BE TO MIMIC THE CALIFORNIA

04:34:29.820 --> 04:34:31.588
HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS. BUT

04:34:31.655 --> 04:34:33.123
THIS EXEMPTION MIGHT SWEEP TOO

04:34:33.190 --> 04:34:34.357
BROADLY LEAVING MANY HOMEOWNERS

04:34:34.424 --> 04:34:35.625
AND LANDLORDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO

04:34:35.692 --> 04:34:37.194
FORBEARANCE. ANOTHER OPTION

04:34:37.260 --> 04:34:39.162
THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IS. TO

04:34:39.229 --> 04:34:41.865
POTENTIALLY- CONSIDER AN

04:34:41.932 --> 04:34:43.266
EXEMPTION BASED ON INSTITUTIONS

04:34:43.333 --> 04:34:44.434
SIZE SO. THIS LITERALLY LAYS

04:34:44.501 --> 04:34:46.269
OUT- THAT WITH THE

04:34:46.336 --> 04:34:47.771
CONVERSATIONS AND WHAT I WOULD

04:34:47.838 --> 04:34:50.540
SAY S- I'M VERY COMMITTED TO

04:34:50.607 --> 04:34:51.641
WORKING CONTINUE TO WORK

04:34:51.708 --> 04:34:53.710
THROUGH THIS. TO COMPLETELY IN

04:34:53.777 --> 04:34:55.145
A GOOD PLACE TO ADDRESS THESE

04:34:55.212 --> 04:34:57.981
CONCERNS. I THINK SPEAKING FOR

04:34:58.048 --> 04:34:59.049
MYSELF VERY MUCH RESPECT THE

04:34:59.115 --> 04:35:03.720
IMPORTANT WORK THAT. CREDIT

04:35:03.787 --> 04:35:04.254
UNIONS AND OTHER COMMUNITY

04:35:04.321 --> 04:35:05.021
BASED NO. LENDER PROVIDE AND WE

04:35:05.088 --> 04:35:06.056
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. THAT

04:35:06.122 --> 04:35:08.425
SO- SO VERY COMMITTED TO

04:35:08.491 --> 04:35:10.427
CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION AND

04:35:10.493 --> 04:35:11.561
I. AM HOPEFUL THAT BY THE TIME

04:35:11.628 --> 04:35:13.129
THIS GETS THE SENATE FLOOR-

04:35:13.196 --> 04:35:14.264
HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE ARRIVED

04:35:14.331 --> 04:35:15.866
AT AT AT AT AT A BETTER SPOT IN

04:35:15.932 --> 04:35:18.702
THAT. AND I CAN'T KISS ASSEMBLY

04:35:18.768 --> 04:35:20.837
MEMBER LEóN. AND I WILL ADD IT

04:35:20.904 --> 04:35:21.972
YOU KNOW THAT I CONCUR WITH THE

04:35:22.038 --> 04:35:23.273
AUTHOR I THINK IT'S ALSO ONE OF

04:35:23.340 --> 04:35:24.441
THE REASONS THAT WE'RE STILL

04:35:24.507 --> 04:35:25.775
HAVING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

04:35:25.842 --> 04:35:27.944
CREDIT UNIONS ON AND CERTAINLY

04:35:28.011 --> 04:35:29.546
THERE'S A LIST OF. FINANCIAL

04:35:29.613 --> 04:35:32.449
INSTITUTIONS THAT. ARE ASKING

04:35:32.515 --> 04:35:34.818
TO BE LOOKED AT DIFFERENTLY- IS

04:35:34.885 --> 04:35:36.219
ALSO BECAUSE THE MOST RECENT

04:35:36.286 --> 04:35:37.387
REPORTS FROM THE PARK

04:35:37.454 --> 04:35:38.255
DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS

04:35:38.321 --> 04:35:40.023
OVERSIGHT. SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA

04:35:40.090 --> 04:35:41.191
CREDIT UNIONS HAVE VERY

04:35:41.258 --> 04:35:42.893
ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVELS. AND

04:35:42.959 --> 04:35:44.728
EVEN AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE

04:35:44.794 --> 04:35:46.529
EXPECTED LOSSES RECORDED BY THE

04:35:46.596 --> 04:35:47.597
CREDIT UNIONS IN THE SECOND

04:35:47.664 --> 04:35:49.332
QUARTER. THE AVERAGE CAPITAL

04:35:49.399 --> 04:35:51.001
LEVEL FOR CRACK CALIFORNIA

04:35:51.067 --> 04:35:52.969
CREDIT UNIONS REMAINS ABOVE 11%

04:35:53.036 --> 04:35:56.373
WHICH- EXCEEDS. THE 7%

04:35:56.439 --> 04:35:58.008
THRESHOLD FOR REGULATORS TO

04:35:58.074 --> 04:36:00.543
DEEM. I CREDIT UNIONS AS WELL

04:36:00.610 --> 04:36:02.012
THE LIGHT. SO I THINK WE ARE TO

04:36:02.078 --> 04:36:04.581
IGNORE. THAT THERE'S STILL A

04:36:04.648 --> 04:36:06.216
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS-

04:36:06.283 --> 04:36:07.517
BECAUSE THEIR FINANCIAL

04:36:07.584 --> 04:36:10.120
SITUATION- IS SUCH THAT THESE

04:36:10.186 --> 04:36:11.655
THAT THEY OUT THEY STILL HAVE

04:36:11.721 --> 04:36:13.456
BARS. AND WE WANT TO KNOW HOW

04:36:13.523 --> 04:36:15.759
WE CAN HELP THE BARS THAT HAVE.

04:36:15.825 --> 04:36:18.595
AT A CREDIT UNION- LOAN

04:36:18.662 --> 04:36:19.896
MORTGAGE AND SO WE ARE

04:36:19.963 --> 04:36:20.997
COMMITTED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

04:36:21.064 --> 04:36:23.533
HOW TO BEST. SOLVE THIS- AND

04:36:23.600 --> 04:36:25.302
ALSO THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT

04:36:25.368 --> 04:36:27.237
OF INTEREST I KNOW THAT- YOU

04:36:27.304 --> 04:36:28.672
KNOW THAT THERE'S LEGISLATORS

04:36:28.738 --> 04:36:31.174
CARE. A LOT ABOUT THE WORLD OF

04:36:31.241 --> 04:36:31.741
CREDIT UNIONS AND COMMUNITY

04:36:31.808 --> 04:36:33.910
BANKS- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK

04:36:33.977 --> 04:36:35.078
AT THE DATA AND FACTS TO. HELP

04:36:35.145 --> 04:36:36.947
INFORM US ON HOW WE MOVE

04:36:37.013 --> 04:36:37.981
FORWARD FOR THE INDIVIDUALS

04:36:38.048 --> 04:36:40.917
THAT DO HAVE. AGES UNDER THOSE

04:36:40.984 --> 04:36:42.652
AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. I

04:36:42.719 --> 04:36:45.088
THINK THAT'S VERY WISE-

04:36:45.155 --> 04:36:47.290
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DID. YOU TRY TO

04:36:47.357 --> 04:36:48.525
BE EVIDENCE DRIVEN AND ENGAGE

04:36:48.591 --> 04:36:50.560
D. B. O. FRANKLY AS MUCH AS WE

04:36:50.627 --> 04:36:51.695
POSSIBLY CAN IN THIS PROCESS

04:36:51.761 --> 04:36:55.098
AND- WHAT THE DATA FOR. DRIVE

04:36:55.165 --> 04:36:57.300
YOU ON THE STATE OF BOTH

04:36:57.367 --> 04:36:58.902
CAPITAL MARKETS IS OF OUR OUR-

04:36:58.969 --> 04:37:00.804
AT THE CAN BE MADE. ASSEMBLY

04:37:00.870 --> 04:37:03.573
THIS COULD PASS QUITE YEAH

04:37:03.640 --> 04:37:05.508
DEVIN SORT OF THE- THAT'S THE

04:37:05.575 --> 04:37:07.577
BIG RED LINE BUT THAT'S

04:37:07.644 --> 04:37:10.013
ENLIGHTENING THOSE NUMBERS-

04:37:10.080 --> 04:37:16.486
OKAY. WELL YOU KNOW LISTEN IT.

04:37:16.553 --> 04:37:17.120
WE'RE IN A SPOT HERE I THINK.

04:37:17.187 --> 04:37:17.988
WE GOT A PERSON THIS OPTION

04:37:18.054 --> 04:37:18.822
RIGHT NOW. I WISH WE WERE IN

04:37:18.888 --> 04:37:20.323
THIS. AND WE ACTUALLY HAD TO

04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:22.192
SAY ADEQUATE CAPITAL GOING TO

04:37:22.258 --> 04:37:23.693
THOSE FOR PANDEMIC RELIEF AND

04:37:23.760 --> 04:37:25.328
HAVE A STEADY FLOW SO THAT WE

04:37:25.395 --> 04:37:26.963
WOULDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO.

04:37:27.030 --> 04:37:28.398
PURSUE THESE OTHER REMEDY BUT

04:37:28.465 --> 04:37:30.233
GIVEN THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCE

04:37:30.300 --> 04:37:31.334
THE PEOPLE ARE AND I DON'T

04:37:31.401 --> 04:37:33.236
THINK WE CAN. AFFORD TO BREAK

04:37:33.303 --> 04:37:34.904

DETAIL ORIENTED THIS IS A VERY

04:37:44.814 --> 04:37:47.350
VERY TOUGH. CLAIM TO LAND IN A

04:37:47.417 --> 04:37:48.785
SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH A

04:37:48.852 --> 04:37:50.253
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRECISION

ALL STOP AT LINE INQUIRY I

05:19:25.412 --> 05:19:26.514
THINK WE SHOULD TURN THIS INTO

05:19:26.580 --> 05:19:27.882
A DRINKING GAME EVERY TIME WE

05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:29.884

05:19:29.950 --> 05:19:32.920
THE VERBAL ACROBATS ARE

05:19:32.987 --> 05:19:34.188
EXTRAORDINARY. DO YOU HAVE ANY

05:19:34.255 --> 05:19:36.390
QUESTION I DO I DO ACTUALLY DO.

05:19:36.457 --> 05:19:39.360
SO MOVING ONTO TO THE MERITS OF

05:19:39.426 --> 05:19:41.862
IT- SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY SEEMS

05:19:41.929 --> 05:19:43.964
LIKE IT MAKES SENSE TO ME-

05:19:44.031 --> 05:19:45.566
HAVING THE POLICIES. THE

INSURANCE- LIABILITY. POLICIES

05:19:49.537 --> 05:19:55.276
IN PLACE. AND. THE OTHER THING

05:19:55.342 --> 05:19:56.377
IS THAT MAKES THAT MAKES A LOT

05:19:56.443 --> 05:20:00.281
OF SENSE WHAT CAUSES ME ANGST

05:20:00.347 --> 05:20:02.216
IS THE WAIVER. AND I'M TRYING

05:20:02.283 --> 05:20:04.585
TO UNDERSTAND. EXISTS I THOUGHT

05:20:04.652 --> 05:20:05.953
I UNDERSTOOD EARLIER BUT THEN I

05:20:06.020 --> 05:20:08.122
THINK WE HAD TO SOME TELEPHONE

05:20:08.188 --> 05:20:10.958
ENQUIRIES- IN AND MAYBE TO LOOK

05:20:11.025 --> 05:20:14.061
AT MORE CONFUSING. I RENT. A

05:20:14.128 --> 05:20:16.363
SCOOTER RIDE I GET ON THE

05:20:16.430 --> 05:20:19.900
SCOOTER AND I HIT SOMEONE. THAT

05:20:19.967 --> 05:20:22.102
INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT THAT

05:20:22.169 --> 05:20:24.505
THIRD PARTY IS THAT THIRD PARTY

05:20:24.572 --> 05:20:26.807
HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE. THE

05:20:26.874 --> 05:20:32.179
SCOOTER COMPANY. THEY MAY HAVE-

05:20:32.246 --> 05:20:33.380
DISINVITE AND THE CAUSE OF

05:20:33.447 --> 05:20:35.516
ACTION TO SUE THE COMPANY IT

05:20:35.583 --> 05:20:37.718
WOULD DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF

05:20:37.785 --> 05:20:39.920
THE CASE I THINK AS THE MATH

05:20:39.987 --> 05:20:42.823
MADAM CHAIR INDICATED THIS THIS.

05:20:42.890 --> 05:20:45.693
CHANGE TORT LAW IN IN ANY WAY

05:20:45.759 --> 05:20:47.728
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

05:20:47.795 --> 05:20:51.799
MAY BE- A DUTY ON BEHALF OF THE

05:20:51.865 --> 05:20:53.801
SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE

05:20:53.867 --> 05:20:57.671
PROVIDER- TO THE THIRD PARTY-

05:20:57.738 --> 05:20:59.707
YOU KNOW IF IT WAS A CASE OF

05:20:59.773 --> 05:21:01.709
SAY WITHOUT COULD FACE THAT WAS

05:21:01.775 --> 05:21:03.644
NOT MAINTAINED. ARE YOU KNOW

05:21:03.711 --> 05:21:05.446
EXACTLY WHAT PART SO IT HAVE

05:21:05.512 --> 05:21:07.982
THAT LET'S MOVE TO THE PRIMARY

05:21:08.048 --> 05:21:12.052
USER I'M ON THE SCOOTER. EIGHT

05:21:12.119 --> 05:21:12.620
FORGET THE MECHANIC FAILURE

05:21:12.686 --> 05:21:14.388
THAT SEEMS CLEAR THAT. IN THAT

05:21:14.455 --> 05:21:16.824
EVENT THERE WOULD BE- LIABILITY

05:21:16.890 --> 05:21:18.826
EXPOSURE. I DIDN'T TIE MY

05:21:18.892 --> 05:21:20.694
SHOELACES I FALL OFF BREAK MY

05:21:20.761 --> 05:21:24.999
LEG. CAN I. THEN WITHOUT THIS

05:21:25.065 --> 05:21:28.569
WAIVER ODD WHAT I'D BE ABLE TO

05:21:28.636 --> 05:21:30.938
SUE THE SCOOTER COMPANY FOR

05:21:31.005 --> 05:21:33.807
THAT. AGAIN THIS DOESN'T CHANGE

05:21:33.874 --> 05:21:36.677
THE EXISTING TORT LAW- IF THEY

05:21:36.744 --> 05:21:37.978
HAVE A BECAUSE IT OUT OF

05:21:38.045 --> 05:21:40.614
ACTION. BUT I MEAN IF THE- IF

05:21:40.681 --> 05:21:43.283
THE PROVIDERS. YOU KNOW DID NOT

05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:45.386
BREACH ANY DUTY OF CARE TO THE

05:21:45.452 --> 05:21:47.721
USER YOU KNOW EXACTLY EXACTLY

05:21:47.788 --> 05:21:48.756
GETTING TO CENTER ON BURKE'S

05:21:48.822 --> 05:21:50.758
POINT- WHICH I THOUGHT WAS IT

05:21:50.824 --> 05:21:52.226
WAS INTERESTING IS. WHAT

05:21:52.292 --> 05:21:53.894
EXACTLY DOES A WAIVER OF

05:21:53.961 --> 05:21:57.064
LIABILITY OFFER IF TORT LAW IS

05:21:57.131 --> 05:21:59.700
NOT BEING SUBSTANTIALLY

05:21:59.767 --> 05:22:02.703
MODIFIED. AND THERE IS A REASON

05:22:02.770 --> 05:22:04.571
WHY PEOPLE PURSUE IT. THEY

05:22:04.638 --> 05:22:06.473
PURSUE IT BECAUSE ONE IT'S A

05:22:06.540 --> 05:22:08.242
GET OUT OF LITIGATION CARTON IT

05:22:08.308 --> 05:22:11.078
CUT SHORT. WHAT OTHERWISE COULD

05:22:11.145 --> 05:22:13.147
BE A PROLONGED EXPERIENCE IN

05:22:13.213 --> 05:22:14.448
THE COURTS ORDERED LENGTHY

05:22:14.515 --> 05:22:16.316
NEGOTIATIONS ON AND SO FORTH

05:22:16.383 --> 05:22:18.686
THAT MAKES IT A LOT CLEANER SO

05:22:18.752 --> 05:22:20.821
I CAN SEE WHY THE ENTITIES.

05:22:20.888 --> 05:22:23.724
WANT TO PURSUE THAT. AND THEN I

05:22:23.791 --> 05:22:25.759
GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF IF I

05:22:25.826 --> 05:22:29.363
WERE TO RENT A BICYCLE. OR

05:22:29.430 --> 05:22:31.331

OF THEM ARE GOING TO HAVE. UP A

05:22:34.101 --> 05:22:36.704
LIABILITY WAIVERS. SO HOW IS

THAT DIFFERENT ARE THE HOWEVER

05:22:39.440 --> 05:22:42.142
THOSE CIRCA. DIFFERENT IN AND

05:22:42.209 --> 05:22:45.312

BECAUSE THESE ARE RELATIVELY

05:26:46.853 --> 05:26:48.922

05:27:11.178 --> 05:27:13.513
RULES OF THE ROAD DETECTABLE TO

THESE DEVICES AND THAT'S ONE OF

05:27:15.349 --> 05:27:16.249
THE THINGS THAT THE LOCAL

05:27:16.316 --> 05:27:18.218
CITIES DO WHEN THEY PASSED

05:27:18.285 --> 05:27:19.453
THEIR PERMITTING REGULATIONS.

05:27:19.519 --> 05:27:21.455
IS THEY CAN CREATE ADDITIONAL

05:27:21.521 --> 05:27:23.023
REGULATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN BE

05:27:23.090 --> 05:27:24.424
ON THE SIDE WALK OFF OF THE

05:27:24.491 --> 05:27:26.526
SIDEWALK BUT THEY ARE REQUIRED

TELL YOU KNOW I'VE IT THEY ARE

05:27:34.501 --> 05:27:36.036
REALLY CONVENE THERE THEY CAN

05:27:36.103 --> 05:27:37.237
BE VERY HELPFUL IN CONGESTED

05:27:37.304 --> 05:27:39.740
AREAS- I HAVE ALSO SEEN SOME

05:27:39.806 --> 05:27:42.209
TRULY RECKLESS BEHAVIOR BY SOME

05:27:42.275 --> 05:27:43.744
OF THE FOLKS. THAT THE YOUTH

05:27:43.810 --> 05:27:48.148

AS IF WE ARE. SEARCHING FOR.

05:27:56.590 --> 05:28:00.260
PREEMPTIVE LEGISLATION THE

05:28:00.327 --> 05:28:02.662
ISSUE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE RIGHT

05:28:02.729 --> 05:28:04.331
ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT

05:28:04.398 --> 05:28:06.199
ALTHOUGH I THINK THE LIABILITY

05:28:06.266 --> 05:28:08.668
INSURANCE POLICY I THINK IS

05:28:08.735 --> 05:28:10.337
APPROPRIATE NON PROVISIONAL

05:28:10.404 --> 05:28:12.706
ONE- BUT I THINK THE WAIVER

05:28:12.773 --> 05:28:16.643
ISSUE- IS IT JUST NOT RIGHT AND

05:28:16.710 --> 05:28:18.078
IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT COVERED

05:28:18.145 --> 05:28:19.146
RELATED I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS

05:28:19.212 --> 05:28:20.647
COME BACK IN JANUARY BUT THAT'S

05:28:20.714 --> 05:28:22.249

THIS WAY SOME OF SPORT. BANTOCK

05:28:35.262 --> 05:28:36.763
KEEP THINKING WHEN YOU GO TO A

05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:38.331
BASEBALL GAME THEY TELL YOU TO

05:28:38.398 --> 05:28:40.133
GET HIT BY BASEBALL HE WAS SOON

05:28:40.200 --> 05:28:41.968
THE RISK I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

05:28:42.035 --> 05:28:44.004

DO IS CLARIFY WHAT THEY REALLY

05:28:57.551 --> 05:28:59.119
ARE. THERE ARE MODE OF

05:28:59.186 --> 05:29:02.789
TRANSPORTATION- AND SO- IT

05:29:02.856 --> 05:29:04.257
WOULD IT'S NOT CHANGING

05:29:04.324 --> 05:29:06.560
LIABILITY STANDARDS- AND

05:29:06.626 --> 05:29:08.261
CREATING NEW LAW WHAT IT SAYS

05:29:08.328 --> 05:29:11.064
YOU CANNOT. APPLY ASSUMPTION OF

05:29:11.131 --> 05:29:14.167
THE RISK TO THESE VEHICLES AS

IF THEY WERE LIKE YOU'RE GOING

05:29:15.502 --> 05:29:16.937
SKIING OR WHAT HAVE YOU THESE

ARE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. AND

05:29:21.141 --> 05:29:22.442
THEY HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED

05:29:22.509 --> 05:29:26.613
APPROPRIATE. HAVE TO A- SICK

05:29:26.680 --> 05:29:28.181
YOU KNOW COMPLY WITH THE

05:29:28.248 --> 05:29:30.317
REQUIREMENTS OF SOMEONE WHO'S

05:29:30.383 --> 05:29:32.552
PUTTING THESE. VEHICLES IF YOU

05:29:32.619 --> 05:29:34.521
WILL ON THE ROAD AND ACTS OF

05:29:34.588 --> 05:29:36.156
THE ANALOGY I DON'T THINK CAR

05:29:36.223 --> 05:29:36.957
MANUFACTURER COULD GET AWAY

05:29:37.023 --> 05:29:39.459
WITH THAT- AND WHAT WE'RE

05:29:39.526 --> 05:29:41.828
SAYING IS NEITHER SHOULD THE-

05:29:41.895 --> 05:29:44.264
THE SHOULD THESE VEHICLES. ARE

05:29:44.331 --> 05:29:45.465
IN THEIR NEW PRODUCT I MEAN

05:29:45.532 --> 05:29:48.101
THEY- THESE MOBILITY DEVICES

05:29:48.168 --> 05:29:49.703
ARE POPPING UP AND I THINK OVER

05:29:49.769 --> 05:29:51.538
THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WITH

05:29:51.605 --> 05:29:53.707
THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS.

05:29:53.773 --> 05:29:56.076
IDENTIFY CLEARLY WHAT THE

05:29:56.143 --> 05:29:57.844
PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS ARE WHAT

05:29:57.911 --> 05:30:00.247
OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE ALL OF THE

05:30:00.313 --> 05:30:02.582
WAY THEY ARE. HANDLED IN THE

05:30:02.649 --> 05:30:04.651
WAY. THEY ARE PRESENTED TO THE

05:30:04.718 --> 05:30:05.685
PUBLIC THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

05:30:05.752 --> 05:30:08.188
PICKED UP AT NIGHT. THE BROUGHT

05:30:08.255 --> 05:30:10.056

DO IS PUT SOME CLARITY ON IT.

05:30:29.976 --> 05:30:31.178
I'M NOT SURE I MAKE THE CODE

CONNECTION. DIRECTLY MYSELF BUT

05:30:33.480 --> 05:30:34.781
I DO THINK THAT GIVEN THE FACT

RURAL CORRECTLY IF I REMEMBER

05:32:15.649 --> 05:32:16.916
CORRECTLY FROM MY LAW WHAT THE

ANY OTHER CONSUMER INDUSTRY IN

CALIFORNIA BUT WOULDN'T BE

05:32:27.260 --> 05:32:29.229
AVAILABLE TO US- TO USE THE

05:32:29.296 --> 05:32:30.964
BASEBALL GAME ANALOGY BEFORE

05:32:31.031 --> 05:32:32.832
YOU KNOW IT IT IT IS COMMON

05:32:32.899 --> 05:32:33.967
THAT WHEN YOU GO TO A BASEBALL

05:32:34.034 --> 05:32:35.935
GAME YOU ASSUME THE RISK. OF A

05:32:36.002 --> 05:32:38.004
OF A BASEBALL STRIKE YOU. BUT

05:32:38.071 --> 05:32:39.873
BUT BUT WHAT WHAT THERE ISN'T

05:32:39.939 --> 05:32:41.474
IS A RULE THAT THAT THAT THE

05:32:41.541 --> 05:32:43.610
DODGERS ALONE CAN'T HAVE THEIR

USED HAVE HAD THEIR CUSTOMERS

05:32:45.312 --> 05:32:46.946
SIGN SUCH A WAIVER BUT TO DO IT

05:32:47.013 --> 05:32:48.615
BUT THE GIANTS BUT IF THERE WAS

05:32:48.682 --> 05:32:50.350
IF THERE WAS A TIME TO MAKE.

05:32:50.417 --> 05:32:52.052
CHANGES TO SOME SERVICE DR

05:32:52.118 --> 05:32:53.920
PROMOTE THE TRANSPORT I THINK

05:32:53.987 --> 05:32:54.721
ARGUED THAT IT SHOULD APPLY

05:32:54.788 --> 05:32:57.324
EQUALLY TO IT TO ALMOST

05:32:57.390 --> 05:32:58.558
TRANSPORT BECAUSE I TRIED TO

05:32:58.625 --> 05:32:59.559
GET EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE

05:32:59.626 --> 05:33:01.828
STATE CHANGE A LOT ABOUT ON THE

05:33:01.895 --> 05:33:02.796
BOARDWALK BUT WHAT IT DOES

05:33:02.862 --> 05:33:04.631
CHANGES THE SCOPE OF WHAT. WHAT

05:33:04.698 --> 05:33:06.533
MAY OR MAY NOT BE INCLUDED IN

05:33:06.599 --> 05:33:08.601
IT IN A USER AGREEMENT- AND I

05:33:08.668 --> 05:33:10.203
BELIEVE MISTER DILLON AT LITTLE

05:33:10.270 --> 05:33:11.037
BIT EARLIER WHAT VALUE THERE

05:33:11.104 --> 05:33:12.038
WEREN'T ACTUALLY WERE FROM THE

05:33:12.105 --> 05:33:14.074
REGION AND I THINK OF THAT AND

05:33:14.140 --> 05:33:15.975
I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT THE

05:33:16.042 --> 05:33:17.077
FINANCIAL REALITIES OPERATE ANY.

05:33:17.143 --> 05:33:25.785
BUSINESS YEAH. WILL BE A RISK

05:33:25.852 --> 05:33:27.987
AND AVOID AT ALL. TROLL ON THE

THAT WE'RE CLEAR- THE IDEA OF

05:59:48.533 --> 05:59:50.235
THIS BILL IS TO REQUIRE A

05:59:50.302 --> 05:59:52.804

06:00:10.455 --> 06:00:13.124
DID IN IT WAS BY THE OPPOSITION

06:00:16.661 --> 06:00:19.030

06:00:28.373 --> 06:00:31.276
SIMPLE. SIMPLE IS BETTER- THE

06:00:31.343 --> 06:00:33.011
BILL SIMPLY PROHIBITS PRO

06:00:33.078 --> 06:00:34.913
PROHIBITS ARRANGING FOR THE

06:00:34.980 --> 06:00:36.448
DELIVERY OF A RESTAURANTS FOOD

06:00:36.514 --> 06:00:38.950
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. SIMPLE

06:00:39.017 --> 06:00:41.786
IT'S A DIRECTED I THINK GOOD

06:00:41.853 --> 06:00:44.322
OLD FASHION REGULATION OF A AN

06:00:44.389 --> 06:00:45.724
ABUSIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. ARE

06:00:45.790 --> 06:00:47.392
TICKETS INTERESTED OUT OF THE

06:00:47.459 --> 06:00:48.393
RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION

06:00:48.460 --> 06:00:50.762
SUPPORTERS AND THE TECH

06:00:50.829 --> 06:00:52.697
INDUSTRY SIZZLE RESTAURANTS ARE

06:00:52.764 --> 06:00:54.566
GOING TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS.

06:00:54.632 --> 06:00:56.167
THE SOMETHING IS A LITTLE OFF

06:00:56.234 --> 06:00:57.469
AND IF STRESS THEY WERE GONNA

06:00:57.535 --> 06:00:58.870
GET THE BUSINESS I SUSPECTED MY

06:00:58.937 --> 06:01:00.338
EXPERIENCE WITH THE RESTAURANT

06:01:00.405 --> 06:01:01.840
INDUSTRY IS THEY'RE VERY VOCAL

06:01:01.906 --> 06:01:04.843
AND WOULD BE HERE IN

06:01:04.909 --> 06:01:07.412
OPPOSITION. BUT IN FACT PORT

06:01:07.479 --> 06:01:11.750
SO- WELL THIS BILL I FOR SEEK A

06:01:11.816 --> 06:01:12.817
REST CONCERTS BEFORE YOU PROF

06:01:12.884 --> 06:01:16.421
OFF THEIR PRODUCT AND WHY- IS

06:01:16.488 --> 06:01:18.656
IN THIS BEING DONE ALREADY- THE

06:01:18.723 --> 06:01:20.358
ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO

06:01:20.425 --> 06:01:23.094
BE COMPLICATED. I THINK IS- IS

06:01:23.161 --> 06:01:27.899
CHESTER. INACCURATE THE BILL

06:01:27.966 --> 06:01:29.467
THE FOOD FACILITY EXPRESSLY

06:01:29.534 --> 06:01:33.204
AUTHORIZING THE FOOD DELIVERY

06:01:33.271 --> 06:01:34.572
PLATFORM TO TAKE OR IN DELIVER

06:01:34.639 --> 06:01:37.876
MEALS PREPARED BY THE FACILITY.

06:01:37.942 --> 06:01:39.444
THE TECH JUST SINCE IN WRITING

06:01:39.511 --> 06:01:42.714
THAT'S UP TO SAY. AND THEN

06:01:42.781 --> 06:01:43.882
EMAIL ACTUALLY COULD COULD

06:01:43.948 --> 06:01:44.949
SATISFY THIS REQUIREMENT

06:01:45.016 --> 06:01:46.151
THERE'S NO FORMALITIES

06:01:46.217 --> 06:01:50.655
REQUIRED- THE POINT IS THIS IS

06:01:50.722 --> 06:01:53.191
NOT AN ONEROUS REQUIREMENT- AND

06:01:53.258 --> 06:01:54.959
THE LAPSES SERVICE ARGUMENT AS

06:01:55.026 --> 06:01:57.128
I INDICATED IF THERE WAS REALLY

06:01:57.195 --> 06:01:59.364
GOING TO BE A LAPSE OF SERVICE

06:01:59.431 --> 06:02:00.465
THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY WOULD

06:02:00.532 --> 06:02:01.966
BE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. JUST

06:02:02.033 --> 06:02:04.502
SIMPLY OF THESE PLATFORMS FROM

06:02:04.569 --> 06:02:06.204
WHAT I HAVE GATHERED A MOVEMENT

06:02:06.271 --> 06:02:07.505
WHICH I'VE HEARD IN MY OWN

06:02:07.572 --> 06:02:09.974
COMMUNITY IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS

06:02:10.041 --> 06:02:12.410
IS THAT MOST OF THE PROFIT GOES

06:02:12.477 --> 06:02:15.280
TO THE A PLATFORM TO THE

06:02:15.346 --> 06:02:16.514
DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT AND

06:02:16.581 --> 06:02:19.684
REST. COOLEY THEIR PROFIT WHICH

06:02:19.751 --> 06:02:22.020
IS- ANYWAY IS REDUCED EVEN MORE

06:02:22.087 --> 06:02:24.656
DRAMATIC. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

06:02:24.722 --> 06:02:26.858
SHOULD BE TO. AND IT'S

06:02:26.925 --> 06:02:28.426
SOMETHING THAT UNLESS THE

06:02:28.493 --> 06:02:29.961
RESTAURANT KNOWS THAT THERE'S

06:02:30.028 --> 06:02:32.063
SOMEONE ACTUALLY DOING THIS ON

06:02:32.130 --> 06:02:33.465
THEIR PLATFORM THEY HAVE NOBODY

06:02:33.531 --> 06:02:36.468
TO NEGOTIATE WITH. SO IT JUST

06:02:36.534 --> 06:02:39.037
SEEMS TO ME THAT. THIS IS

06:02:39.104 --> 06:02:40.405
SOMETHING PARTICULARLY ARE

06:02:40.472 --> 06:02:42.707
SMALLER BUSINESSES. LARGE

06:02:42.774 --> 06:02:44.676
CHAINS MIGHT HAVE BARGAINING

06:02:44.742 --> 06:02:46.578
POWER AND LEVERAGE BUT- SMALL

06:02:46.644 --> 06:02:47.846
BUSINESSES ARE REALLY AT THE

06:02:47.912 --> 06:02:50.748
MERCY OF THESE COMPANIES AND-

06:02:50.815 --> 06:02:52.817
THIS BILL ELIMINATES

06:02:52.884 --> 06:02:54.552
CONDUCTANCE OF BENEFIT BETTER

06:02:54.619 --> 06:02:56.321
AFTER SEN. I JUST LIKE TO POINT

06:02:56.387 --> 06:02:57.856
OUT THAT A LOT OF THIS WERE

06:02:57.922 --> 06:03:00.391
TREADING NEW GROUND BECAUSE

06:03:00.458 --> 06:03:03.128
THESE PLATFORMS IN THE WHOLE.

06:03:03.194 --> 06:03:05.196
IDEA OF THE INTERNET AND IN

06:03:05.263 --> 06:03:07.899
PLATFORM. CONDUCTING CUSTOMERS

06:03:07.966 --> 06:03:12.504
IS NEW. THE TECH INDUSTRY TESTS

06:03:12.570 --> 06:03:13.571
INTO BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT OF

06:03:13.638 --> 06:03:16.407
THIS IDEA THEY BE ABLE TO. IT

06:03:16.474 --> 06:03:20.912
AND- BUT- THESE ARE NOT IN THE

06:03:20.979 --> 06:03:22.213
SUPPOSED TO BE PREDATORY

06:03:22.280 --> 06:03:24.149
INDUSTRIES AND PREDATORY A

06:03:24.215 --> 06:03:27.519
COMPANIES- THERE ARE CERTAIN

06:03:27.585 --> 06:03:28.853
THAT KIND OF RULES OF FAIRNESS

06:03:28.920 --> 06:03:31.856
AND CONTRACT IN IN WHAT HAVE

06:03:31.923 --> 06:03:33.725
YOU THAT STILL NEED TO BE

06:03:33.791 --> 06:03:35.927
ABIDED BY EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE

06:03:35.994 --> 06:03:38.530
THESE NEW KINDS OF CONCEPTS AND

06:03:38.596 --> 06:03:40.031
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL.

06:03:40.098 --> 06:03:42.667
INDICATES IT IS RESTORE SOME

06:03:42.734 --> 06:03:44.669
EQUITY IN BARGAINING POWER AND

06:03:44.736 --> 06:03:46.171
THINGS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL I

06:03:46.237 --> 06:03:47.839
WOULD SUBMIT TO MY COLLEAGUES

06:03:47.906 --> 06:03:49.974
ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE FOR THIS

06:03:50.041 --> 06:03:52.544
MARVELOUS FREE MARKET KEEP

06:03:52.610 --> 06:03:55.547
PUSHING FOR THIS IS HOW A

06:03:55.613 --> 06:03:58.716
FUNCTIONING FREE MARKET CANS

06:03:58.783 --> 06:04:03.655
FIVE BY ALLOWING RESTAURANTS.

06:04:03.721 --> 06:04:04.622
TO OPT INTO THE PROGRAM.

06:04:04.689 --> 06:04:05.890
BELONGS AND THAT'S WITH THE

06:04:05.957 --> 06:04:08.026
ENTITY THAT'S PRODUCING ALL OF

06:04:08.092 --> 06:04:10.461
THE VALUE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP

06:04:10.528 --> 06:04:12.764
AND- AS SOMEONE WHO. EATS OUT

06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:14.699
FREQUENTLY AND TAKES OUT

06:04:14.766 --> 06:04:17.435
FREQUENTLY- I WANT TO MAKE SURE

06:04:17.502 --> 06:04:19.437
THAT THOSE WONDERFUL LOCAL

06:04:19.504 --> 06:04:21.973
RESTAURANTS STAY IN BUSINESS

06:04:22.040 --> 06:04:23.675
AND ARE ABLE TO THRIVE COVERT.

06:04:23.741 --> 06:04:25.944
OR NO COVERED. AND THERE'S A

06:04:26.010 --> 06:04:27.912
CONNECTION ERROR SEVEN. ALL

06:04:27.979 --> 06:04:29.113
RIGHT WITH THAT- THE BILL ANY

06:04:29.180 --> 06:04:31.249
QUESTIONS WE HAVE A MOTION BY

06:04:31.316 --> 06:04:35.053
SENATOR CASKEY SENATOR BORJAS

06:04:35.119 --> 06:04:35.887
HAS A QUESTION. THANK YOU

06:04:35.954 --> 06:04:38.556
SOMEONE I'D I WAS CURIOUS ON

06:04:38.623 --> 06:04:40.692
HOW THIS WAS GOING TO PLAY OUT

06:04:40.758 --> 06:04:42.093
AND I'VE I'VE LEARNED QUITE A

06:04:42.160 --> 06:04:44.229
FEW THINGS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW

06:04:44.295 --> 06:04:45.964
BEFORE ABOUT THIS. OP FOR

06:04:46.030 --> 06:04:47.999
EXAMPLE THE STAFF REPORT

06:04:48.066 --> 06:04:50.335
INDICATED THAT- THE ONLINE

06:04:50.401 --> 06:04:51.836
PLATFORMS WHICH I BELIEVE

06:04:51.903 --> 06:04:54.872
PROVIDE A FANTASTIC SERVICE AND

06:04:54.939 --> 06:04:56.407
REMARKABLY THERE IS A COOKIE

06:04:56.474 --> 06:04:57.775
CONNECTION HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE

06:04:57.842 --> 06:04:59.544
ARE USING ONLINE FOOD

06:04:59.611 --> 06:05:03.615
PURCHASING- PUTS MORE THAN THEY

06:05:03.681 --> 06:05:06.351
DID BEFORE BUT I DID NOT KNOW

06:05:06.417 --> 06:05:10.989
THEY COULD MODIFY THE PRICES.

06:05:11.055 --> 06:05:12.056
WAS KIND OF NEW TO. I DIDN'T

06:05:12.123 --> 06:05:14.792
KNOW ABOUT. MAY THAT WAS

06:05:14.859 --> 06:05:15.393
REFLECTED IN THE PRICE OF THE

06:05:15.460 --> 06:05:20.365
FOOD AND- THE FOLKS THAT HAVE

06:05:20.431 --> 06:05:22.600
THEIR OWN DELIVERY- PERSON

06:05:22.667 --> 06:05:24.902
THERE- I CAN SEE HOW THIS WOULD

06:05:24.969 --> 06:05:25.770
CREATE HAVOC HAVING WORKED IN

06:05:25.837 --> 06:05:26.904
THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY FOR

06:05:26.971 --> 06:05:30.008
MANY MANY YEARS I CAN EASILY

06:05:30.074 --> 06:05:30.541
SEE HOW THIS THING GETS A

06:05:30.608 --> 06:05:33.378
LITTLE WEIRD- SO JUST TWO

06:05:33.444 --> 06:05:34.912
QUESTIONS. THE AGREEMENT THAT

06:05:34.979 --> 06:05:39.317
YOU TALK ABOUT. IT THAT IS UP

06:05:39.384 --> 06:05:41.319
TO THE PARTIES TO CREATE IS

06:05:41.386 --> 06:05:43.221
THAT CORRECT EXACTLY ANNA AS

06:05:43.288 --> 06:05:44.822
THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTED COULD BE

06:05:44.889 --> 06:05:46.391
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS AN

06:05:46.457 --> 06:05:48.693
AFFIRMATIVE OPT IN BY THE

06:05:48.760 --> 06:05:49.894
RESTAURANT IN AN EMAIL OKAY

FACILITY IS DEFINED IN STATUTE.

06:05:57.568 --> 06:05:59.871

PERTAINS TO FOOD FACILITIES SO

06:06:08.646 --> 06:06:10.148
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION

06:06:10.214 --> 06:06:11.282
WHERE THE LINES ARE BLURRED

06:06:11.349 --> 06:06:13.251

06:06:21.726 --> 06:06:23.828

WITH THAT SUPERMARKETS WHO ALSO

06:06:38.676 --> 06:06:41.446
HAVE DELIVERY ASPECTS IN IT IS

06:06:41.512 --> 06:06:43.114
DEALING WITH THE SITUATION AS

06:06:43.181 --> 06:06:45.183
WELL SAM. JUST REQUIRES AN OPT

06:06:45.249 --> 06:06:47.919
IN I MEAN IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT

06:06:47.985 --> 06:06:50.722
ONEROUS- SITUATION AND MOST.

06:06:50.788 --> 06:06:55.993
BIG COMPANIES. RT HAVE CAUGHT

06:06:56.060 --> 06:06:58.563

ELSEWHERE. IS THAT YOUR

06:07:09.240 --> 06:07:11.242
UNDERSTANDING I DON'T THINK WE

BAD THING I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

06:07:43.241 --> 06:07:45.176
THAT IS A SMART THING TO DO AND

06:07:45.243 --> 06:07:47.178
IT ALLOWS FOLKS JUST TO KNOW

CREATED THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING

06:12:33.264 --> 06:12:35.232
TO BLUR THOSE LINES. SO THAT

06:12:35.299 --> 06:12:36.701

ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONES BILL. WE

06:24:47.998 --> 06:24:49.466
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A LARGE

06:24:49.533 --> 06:24:51.768
EXPANSION OF PRODUCT LIABILITY

06:24:51.835 --> 06:24:53.904
LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

06:24:53.970 --> 06:24:56.807
EXTENDING WELL BEYOND. THE

06:24:56.873 --> 06:24:58.074
FRACTURED AND RETAILERS. IN

06:24:58.141 --> 06:25:01.411
CAPTURING ONLINE MARKET PLACES.

06:25:01.478 --> 06:25:04.080
WHICH IS A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE

06:25:04.147 --> 06:25:06.049
IN OUR PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWS.

06:25:06.116 --> 06:25:08.685
I OBVIOUSLY AB THIRTY TO SIXTY

06:25:08.752 --> 06:25:10.487
TWO WOULD ADD A SIGNIFICANT

06:25:10.554 --> 06:25:13.256
CODE SECTION TO OUR CALIFORNIA

06:25:13.323 --> 06:25:16.793
CIVIL CODE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.

06:25:16.860 --> 06:25:18.495
THIS IS THIS WOULD BE A FIRST

06:25:18.562 --> 06:25:21.164
IN THE NATION BILL I WOULD NOTE

06:25:21.231 --> 06:25:21.998
FOR YOU THAT SEVERAL OTHER

06:25:22.065 --> 06:25:23.533
STATE LEGISLATURES AROUND THE

06:25:23.600 --> 06:25:25.335
COUNTRY HAVE CONSIDERED SIMILAR

06:25:25.402 --> 06:25:28.505
BILLS ALL OF WHICH THEY HAVE

06:25:28.572 --> 06:25:31.007
BEEN REJECTED SO FAR. A LOT OF

06:25:31.074 --> 06:25:32.709
STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT

06:25:32.776 --> 06:25:37.180
WHETHER OR NOT- CONSUMERS CAN.

06:25:37.247 --> 06:25:39.516
HAVE ANY FORM OF RECOURSE- I

06:25:39.583 --> 06:25:40.784
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME

06:25:40.851 --> 06:25:42.853
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SOME

06:25:42.919 --> 06:25:44.788
ADDITIONAL FACT PATTERNS BEYOND

06:25:44.855 --> 06:25:47.424
THE ONE THAT WE HEARD FROM THE

06:25:47.491 --> 06:25:50.293
WITNESS IN THE BOLGER CASE. AND

06:25:50.360 --> 06:25:51.828
I MEAN THAT THE BILL ITSELF

06:25:51.895 --> 06:25:53.163
EVEN IN THE FINDINGS TALKS

06:25:53.230 --> 06:25:55.599
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A

06:25:55.665 --> 06:25:59.903
POTENTIAL. OF FOR- PURSUING THE

06:25:59.970 --> 06:26:03.807
COULD BE ACHIEVING. BAND THAT

06:26:03.874 --> 06:26:05.375
LANGUAGE YOU KNOW DOESN'T GIVE

06:26:05.442 --> 06:26:07.010
US CERTAINTY AS TO WHAT SORT OF

06:26:07.077 --> 06:26:08.345
FACT PATTERNS WERE ACTUALLY

06:26:08.411 --> 06:26:10.847
LOOKING TO ADDRESS. NOW ANOTHER

06:26:10.914 --> 06:26:12.182
COMMON HAS BEEN MADE YOUR MADAM

06:26:12.249 --> 06:26:13.583
CHAIR AND MEMBERS ABOUT

06:26:13.650 --> 06:26:15.519
LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. WE

06:26:15.585 --> 06:26:16.686
DON'T SEE THIS IS LEVELING THE

06:26:16.753 --> 06:26:18.255
PLAYING FIELD WE THINK IN FACT

06:26:18.321 --> 06:26:21.258
IT CREATES A DIFFERENT FIELD OF

06:26:21.324 --> 06:26:24.528
PLAY. BECAUSE BY THIS EXAMPLE

06:26:24.594 --> 06:26:26.062
UNDER EXISTING PRODUCT

06:26:26.129 --> 06:26:27.764
LIABILITY LAW IN CALIFORNIA IN

06:26:27.831 --> 06:26:30.467
THE CIVIL CODE- IT DOES PROVIDE

06:26:30.534 --> 06:26:33.136
STRICTLY ABILITY FOR THE BRICK

06:26:33.203 --> 06:26:35.038
AND MORTAR SHOPPING MALL.

06:26:35.105 --> 06:26:37.607
HOWEVER THIS BILL WOULD IMPOSE

06:26:37.674 --> 06:26:40.343
STRICKLAND BILITY ON THE ONLINE

06:26:40.410 --> 06:26:42.479
SHOPPING MALL WHICH DOESN'T

06:26:42.546 --> 06:26:44.614
OCCUR EXCUSE ME I MISSPOKE IT

06:26:44.681 --> 06:26:46.383
PROVIDES STRICT LIABILITY UNDER

06:26:46.449 --> 06:26:47.150
EXISTING LAW FOR THE BRICK AND

06:26:47.217 --> 06:26:50.086
MORTAR. MANUFACTURER RETAILER

06:26:50.153 --> 06:26:51.755
BUT NOT THE BRICK AND MORTAR

06:26:51.821 --> 06:26:54.658
SHOPPING MALL BUT UNDER AB

06:26:54.724 --> 06:26:56.359
THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO. THE ONLINE

06:26:56.426 --> 06:26:57.761
MARKET PLACE THE ONLINE

06:26:57.827 --> 06:26:59.896
SHOPPING MALL WOULD BE SUBJECT

06:26:59.963 --> 06:27:01.898
TO IT. AND WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE

06:27:01.965 --> 06:27:04.901
RESULT THE ULTIMATE RESULT IS.

06:27:04.968 --> 06:27:07.904
THESE PRODUCT PROVIDERS THESE

06:27:07.971 --> 06:27:10.173
WEBSITES THE SERVICE PROVIDERS

06:27:10.240 --> 06:27:11.341
ARE ALL GOING TO BE SUBJECT-

06:27:11.408 --> 06:27:14.344
SUBJECT TO STRICT LIABILITY AND

06:27:14.411 --> 06:27:15.812
SUBSTANTIAL COSTS THERE'S GOING

06:27:15.879 --> 06:27:17.180
TO BE A DIMINUTION IN

06:27:17.247 --> 06:27:19.082
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMERS TO

06:27:19.149 --> 06:27:21.084
PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND THOSE

06:27:21.151 --> 06:27:22.752
THAT THEY DO AT A HIGHER PRICE.

06:27:22.819 --> 06:27:25.021
LET ME CONCLUDE ON THIS POINT-

06:27:25.088 --> 06:27:29.192
AND- IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE WHAT

06:27:29.259 --> 06:27:32.462
HAPPENED. TO MISS BOLGER IN

06:27:32.529 --> 06:27:32.929
THAT PARTICULAR CASE.

06:27:32.996 --> 06:27:35.198
DISCRETION THAT THE JUDGES THE

06:27:35.265 --> 06:27:37.734
COURTS HAVE TODAY DEMONSTRATES

06:27:37.801 --> 06:27:39.436
THAT THERE IS RECOURSE UNDER

06:27:39.502 --> 06:27:42.672
EXISTING LAW IN THIS CASE. AND

06:27:42.739 --> 06:27:44.407
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

06:27:44.474 --> 06:27:45.275
THIS CASE IS LIKELY TO BE

06:27:45.342 --> 06:27:47.277
APPEALED A PENNSYLVANIA STATE

06:27:47.344 --> 06:27:49.112
COURT ACTUALLY MADE A SIMILAR

06:27:49.179 --> 06:27:51.114
DECISION TO BOLGER IT WAS

06:27:51.181 --> 06:27:53.416
REVERSED ON APPEAL AND YOU KNOW

06:27:53.483 --> 06:27:53.917
MADAM CHAIR THAT THIS

06:27:53.984 --> 06:27:55.952
LEGISLATURE HAS OVER THE YEARS

06:27:56.019 --> 06:27:57.153
REGARDLESS OF SUBJECT MATTER

06:27:57.220 --> 06:27:58.888
BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO STEP

06:27:58.955 --> 06:28:02.092
INTO PENDING LITIGATION. BUT

06:28:02.158 --> 06:28:02.726
THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO DOES TAKE A

06:28:02.792 --> 06:28:05.295

LITIGATION PLAYS OUT- FURTHER

06:28:10.533 --> 06:28:11.901
ALONG THE LINES AND THEN

06:28:11.968 --> 06:28:13.837
WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN DECIDE

06:28:13.903 --> 06:28:15.338
WHETHER IT THE CIVIL CODE NEEDS

BRICK AND MORTAR MARKET PLACE

06:36:05.308 --> 06:36:08.978
SO. IT DOESN'T APPLY WHEN THE

06:36:09.045 --> 06:36:10.279
COMPENSATION IS JUST AN

06:36:10.346 --> 06:36:12.381
ADVERTISING FEE WHICH IT

06:36:12.448 --> 06:36:15.518
DOESN'T TO IN THE NORMAL COURSE

06:36:15.585 --> 06:36:17.620
OF COMMERCE. I CRAIGSLIST

06:36:17.687 --> 06:36:19.355
CRAIGSLIST INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH

06:36:19.422 --> 06:36:21.324
I JUST LEARNED ACTUALLY-

06:36:21.390 --> 06:36:23.092
CHARGES AN ADVERTISING FEE AND

06:36:23.159 --> 06:36:25.928
YOU SELL YOUR PRODUCT THERE AND

06:36:25.995 --> 06:36:28.364
THEY MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS

06:36:28.431 --> 06:36:29.832
THEY DON'T PRETEND THAT THEY

06:36:29.899 --> 06:36:31.901
KNOW WHAT THE PRODUCT IS AND

06:36:31.968 --> 06:36:32.768
THEY DON'T BENEFIT FROM THE

06:36:32.835 --> 06:36:34.470
SALE. THEY BENEFIT FROM THE

06:36:34.537 --> 06:36:36.839
ADVERTISING THAT WOULD APPLY

06:36:36.906 --> 06:36:41.444
HERE AS WELL. AND IT TO THE

06:36:41.511 --> 06:36:42.912
BOTTOM LINE IT IT JUST ENSURES

06:36:42.979 --> 06:36:43.980
THAT THE BILL'S APPLICATION

06:36:44.046 --> 06:36:46.015
REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH THE

06:36:46.082 --> 06:36:47.383
PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING STRICT

06:36:47.450 --> 06:36:48.885
LIABILITY CAN WHY DO WE HAVE

06:36:48.951 --> 06:36:51.287
STRICT LIABILITY BECAUSE WE

06:36:51.354 --> 06:36:51.888
WANT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN

06:36:51.954 --> 06:36:54.157
THE CONSUMER- TO ENHANCE SAFETY

06:36:54.223 --> 06:36:55.958
AND PROTECT THE INJURED PARTY

06:36:56.025 --> 06:36:57.827
THE STORE THAT THAT WOMAN A

06:36:57.894 --> 06:37:00.663
SHARED WITH US- IT REQUIRED

06:37:00.730 --> 06:37:02.532
LAWSUIT BECAUSE AMAZON SO WE'RE

06:37:02.598 --> 06:37:04.267
NOT RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE THE

06:37:04.333 --> 06:37:07.703
COMPANY THAT CREATED THE DEVICE

06:37:07.770 --> 06:37:11.174
THAT WAS- A POORLY CRAFTED IN

06:37:11.240 --> 06:37:12.608
ALWAYS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN

06:37:12.675 --> 06:37:14.043
CHINA THAT. IT WAS BEYOND

06:37:14.110 --> 06:37:17.180
REACH- BUT THE FACT THAT AMAZON

06:37:17.246 --> 06:37:19.415
HAS BEEN KNOWN TO AND I CAN'T

06:37:19.482 --> 06:37:20.683
REMEMBER THE NUMBER THOUSANDS

06:37:20.750 --> 06:37:23.119
OF PRODUCTS THAT HAVE KNOWN

06:37:23.186 --> 06:37:26.122
DEFECTS WITHOUT ANY ANY SENSE

06:37:26.189 --> 06:37:28.424
OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SALE

06:37:28.491 --> 06:37:29.825
OF THOSE PRODUCTS BUT THEY

06:37:29.892 --> 06:37:31.594
BENEFIT FROM THE SALE AND AGAIN

06:37:31.661 --> 06:37:34.297
THIS JUST PUTS THIS ON THE SAME

06:37:34.363 --> 06:37:35.665
FOOTING WITH OUR BRICK AND

06:37:35.731 --> 06:37:38.067
MORTAR BUSINESSES SO- THERE

06:37:38.134 --> 06:37:39.435
SUCH MORE I COULD SAY BUT WE

06:37:39.502 --> 06:37:41.537
HAVE A VERY COMPETENT AUTHOR

06:37:41.604 --> 06:37:43.206
HERE WHO CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF

06:37:43.272 --> 06:37:44.874
IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER.

06:37:44.941 --> 06:37:47.109
CONCERNS AND- WE'LL START WITH

06:37:56.686 --> 06:38:00.723
THE ANALYSIS AND- JUST CURIOUS.

06:38:00.790 --> 06:38:02.792
HAS THIS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN

06:38:02.858 --> 06:38:03.292
ANY OTHER STATE TO YOUR

06:38:03.359 --> 06:38:06.162

THIS IS WOULD BE A FIRST I

06:38:07.997 --> 06:38:09.632

06:38:09.699 --> 06:38:11.667
AT THIS AND THURMOND. DIFFERENT

06:38:11.734 --> 06:38:13.669
CASES IN THE COURTS AROUND THE

06:38:13.736 --> 06:38:16.005
COUNTRY BUT BUT NOT ANY

06:38:16.072 --> 06:38:18.207
CONSISTENT POLICY THREAT SO I

06:38:18.274 --> 06:38:20.209
WOULD ASSUME AS USUAL IN THIS

06:38:20.276 --> 06:38:22.178
AREA THAT A LOT OF STATES WILL

06:38:22.245 --> 06:38:22.712
BE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT

06:38:22.778 --> 06:38:25.047
CALIFORNIA DOES. AND ONCE WE

06:38:25.114 --> 06:38:26.882
CAN GET THIS PAST THEN I THINK

06:38:26.949 --> 06:38:28.284
OTHERS WILL TAKE A LOOK AT OUR

06:38:28.351 --> 06:38:30.152
MODEL AND FOLLOW SUIT THANK YOU

06:38:30.219 --> 06:38:32.388
CAN I WOULD JUST COMMENT IT WAS

06:38:32.455 --> 06:38:34.323
POINTED OUT THAT MOTHERS ACTIVE

06:38:34.390 --> 06:38:35.658
LITIGATION AND SHOULDN'T WE

06:38:35.725 --> 06:38:37.994
WAIT I THINK ONE OF THE RULES

06:38:38.060 --> 06:38:40.263
OF THE LEGISLATURE IS TO DEFINE

06:38:40.329 --> 06:38:43.366
POLICY. WHERE THERE MAY BE

06:38:43.432 --> 06:38:46.168
CONFUSION IN THE MARKETPLACE-

06:38:46.235 --> 06:38:47.003
SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

06:38:47.069 --> 06:38:49.505
BENEFITS HERE AND JUST TO BE

06:38:49.572 --> 06:38:50.506
CLEAR I THINK THE CHAIR JUST

06:38:50.573 --> 06:38:52.341
CLARIFY THIS IS WELL. A

06:38:52.408 --> 06:38:55.711
PLATFORM THAT CONNECTS BUYER

06:38:55.778 --> 06:38:58.948
AND THE SELLER. SUCH AS AN EBAY

06:38:59.015 --> 06:39:02.318
EXAMPLE- THEY AREN'T COVERED BY

06:39:02.385 --> 06:39:03.786
THIS BILL OR THEIR

06:39:03.853 --> 06:39:05.788
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY ARE.

06:39:05.855 --> 06:39:06.989
BUT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES

06:39:07.056 --> 06:39:08.491
WHERE THEY WILL BE SO WE

06:39:08.557 --> 06:39:11.494
TRADITIONALLY THINK OF. EBAY AS

06:39:11.560 --> 06:39:12.695
JUST AN AUCTION SITE WE

06:39:12.762 --> 06:39:14.630
TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AT SEA.

06:39:14.697 --> 06:39:17.199
AS JUST CONNECTING. MY MOTHER

06:39:17.266 --> 06:39:19.335
WHO MAKES FELTED BOOTIES AND

06:39:19.402 --> 06:39:20.703
PEOPLE WHO MAY WANT TO BUY

06:39:20.770 --> 06:39:22.705
THOSE HOWEVER. THE BUSINESS

06:39:22.772 --> 06:39:25.007
MODEL THAT THEY ARE MORE AND

06:39:25.074 --> 06:39:26.709
MORE MOVING INTO IS THEY ARE.

06:39:26.776 --> 06:39:28.744
BRINGING IN BRAND NEW PRODUCTS

06:39:28.811 --> 06:39:30.780
AND SEEKING SUPPLIERS AROUND

06:39:30.846 --> 06:39:33.215
THE WORLD SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

06:39:33.282 --> 06:39:35.985
THEY FUNCTION. LIKE ANY BASE

06:39:36.052 --> 06:39:37.720
CASE AN AUCTION HOUSE OR

06:39:37.787 --> 06:39:42.091
ENTITIES CASE JUST FACILITATING

06:39:42.158 --> 06:39:44.026
THE MOVEMENT OF HANDMADE GOODS.

06:39:44.093 --> 06:39:46.462
THOSE TRANSACTIONS WOULD NOT

06:39:46.529 --> 06:39:47.063
APPLY HERE BUT WHERE THEY ARE

06:39:47.129 --> 06:39:51.200
ACTING. LIKE AN AMAZON DOES

06:39:51.267 --> 06:39:53.703
FACILITATING THE DISTRIBUTION

06:39:53.769 --> 06:39:56.439
INTO CALIFORNIA OF GOODS THAT

06:39:56.505 --> 06:39:58.107
ARE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS YES

06:39:58.174 --> 06:39:59.775
IT WOULD APPLY TO THEM THANK

06:39:59.842 --> 06:40:02.411
YOU IN I GUESS. THE SAME WITH

06:40:02.478 --> 06:40:04.246
THE CRAIGSLIST EXAMPLE THAT

06:40:04.313 --> 06:40:06.615
SOME BOOKS THIS IS VIA IS AS

06:40:06.682 --> 06:40:08.417
WELCOMING ONLINE CLASSIFIED AD

06:40:08.484 --> 06:40:09.852
RIGHT SITUATION AND SO WE'RE

06:40:09.919 --> 06:40:12.521
TRYING TO EXEMPT THOSE KINDS OF

06:40:12.588 --> 06:40:17.660
TRANSACTIONS WITH THEIR THE-OPTIONS THE CLASSIFIED ADS IN

06:40:17.727 --> 06:40:18.260
THE OTHERS IN FACT WE'VE TAKEN

06:40:18.327 --> 06:40:20.596
AND- TAKING AN AMENDMENT. THAT

06:40:20.663 --> 06:40:22.698
MAKES IT CLEAR THAT ADVERTISING

06:40:22.765 --> 06:40:24.667
IS NOT RECEIVING BENEFIT

06:40:24.734 --> 06:40:25.368
BECAUSE THAT RECEIPT THE

06:40:25.434 --> 06:40:27.670
BENEFIT IS A TERM OF ART THAT'S

06:40:27.737 --> 06:40:29.271
BEEN USED IN A LOT OF THESE

06:40:29.338 --> 06:40:32.141
CASES GOING BACK FOR DECADES.

06:40:32.208 --> 06:40:33.409
IT'S AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS

06:40:33.476 --> 06:40:35.311
ASKED FOR BY I BELIEVE FACEBOOK

06:40:35.378 --> 06:40:37.747
BUT ONE THAT TO ME MAKES ACTION

06:40:37.813 --> 06:40:40.349
MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE WHAT IF

06:40:40.416 --> 06:40:40.916
THINGS WERE TRYING TO DO IS

06:40:40.983 --> 06:40:42.518
EQUATE. THESE ONLINE

06:40:42.585 --> 06:40:45.988
MARKETPLACES WITH A BRICK AND

06:40:46.055 --> 06:40:46.889
MORTAR AND NOBODY. WHATEVER

06:40:46.956 --> 06:40:49.558
SUGGEST THAT IF FACEBOOK PUT UP

06:40:49.625 --> 06:40:51.761
AN AD FOR A NEWSPAPER PUT UP AN

06:40:51.827 --> 06:40:54.263
AD OR A MAGAZINE PUT UP AN AD

06:40:54.330 --> 06:40:58.334
FOR. A WALMART AND A PRODUCT

06:40:58.401 --> 06:40:59.568
THAT'S BEING SOLD THERE THAT

06:40:59.635 --> 06:41:00.836
THE FACT THAT THEY TOOK THE AD

06:41:00.903 --> 06:41:02.805
REVENUE WOULD MAKE THEM LIABLE

06:41:02.872 --> 06:41:03.973
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY THEY'RE

06:41:04.039 --> 06:41:06.041
NOT A RETAILER AS THE COURTS

06:41:06.108 --> 06:41:08.511
HAVE DEFINED SO WE'RE WE'RE

06:41:08.577 --> 06:41:10.546
STARTING IN IN IS WORRIED ABOUT

06:41:10.613 --> 06:41:11.881
WHAT THIS MEANS WE'RE STARTING

06:41:11.947 --> 06:41:13.249
TO STEP INTO AREAS THAT THAT

06:41:13.315 --> 06:41:14.517
ARE NOT NECESSARILY THAT

06:41:14.583 --> 06:41:16.986
HELPFUL BECAUSE AN ADVERTISER

06:41:17.052 --> 06:41:18.120
IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR CASE

06:41:18.187 --> 06:41:21.757
WOULD NEVER BE. BROUGHT IN. AS

06:41:21.824 --> 06:41:24.493
IN THAT SENSE AS AS A PARTY FOR

06:41:24.560 --> 06:41:26.162
STRICT LIABILITY CASE. IT WOULD

06:41:26.228 --> 06:41:30.266
BE THE- RETAILER SO. WHAT

06:41:30.332 --> 06:41:31.634
THINGS WERE TRYING TO DO IN

06:41:31.700 --> 06:41:33.702
THIS BILL IS QUITE THE ONLINE

06:41:33.769 --> 06:41:36.205
MARKET PLACES IN THE BRICK AND

06:41:36.272 --> 06:41:37.640
MORTAR. AS MUCH AS WE CAN. AND

06:41:37.706 --> 06:41:39.975
NOT CREATE ADDITIONAL KIND OF

06:41:40.042 --> 06:41:41.277
EXEMPTIONS AND LANGUAGE AROUND

06:41:41.343 --> 06:41:44.079
THIS A MAN JUST. GIVEN THE

06:41:44.146 --> 06:41:44.680
SAUSAGE MAKING THAT WE HAVE TO

06:41:44.747 --> 06:41:46.148
GO THROUGH. WE'RE TRYING TO

06:41:46.215 --> 06:41:47.483
ADDRESS AS MANY OF THE CONCERNS

06:41:47.550 --> 06:41:49.151
AS WE CAN BUT I THINK WE NEED

06:41:49.218 --> 06:41:51.387
TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT CREATING

06:41:51.454 --> 06:41:53.456
THESE OTHER CATEGORIES. AND MY

06:41:53.522 --> 06:41:56.158
WORRY IS THAT IF WE DO THEN

06:41:56.225 --> 06:41:57.526
WHEN NEW TECHNOLOGIES COME

06:41:57.593 --> 06:41:58.260
ONLINE IT'S GOING TO BE

06:41:58.327 --> 06:42:00.529
DIFFICULT FOR THE COURTS OR FOR

06:42:00.596 --> 06:42:02.331
THE LEGISLATURE. TO SORT OUT.

06:42:02.398 --> 06:42:04.500
WHETHER OR NOT THAT NEW.

06:42:04.567 --> 06:42:06.135
BUSINESS MODEL WAS INTENDED TO

06:42:06.202 --> 06:42:07.570
BE COVERED HERE SO THE MORE

06:42:07.636 --> 06:42:08.604
WE'RE SAYING IF YOU'RE

06:42:08.671 --> 06:42:10.639
FUNCTIONING ONLINE FOR YOUR

06:42:10.706 --> 06:42:12.241
FUNCTIONING BRICK AND MORTAR

06:42:12.308 --> 06:42:15.311
AND YOU ARE THAT RETAILER AND A

06:42:15.377 --> 06:42:17.780
CONDUIT FOR THAT PRODUCT BEING

06:42:17.847 --> 06:42:20.449
DELIVERED TO. A CALIFORNIA

06:42:20.516 --> 06:42:21.317
CITIZEN AND A CALIFORNIA

06:42:21.383 --> 06:42:23.919
CITIZEN GETS INJURED STRICT

06:42:23.986 --> 06:42:26.489
LIABILITY WILL BE ATTACHED SO

06:42:26.555 --> 06:42:27.756
WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT

06:42:27.823 --> 06:42:29.391
LITERALLY THAT SIMPLE BUT IT'S

06:42:29.458 --> 06:42:31.126
THE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A COMPLEX

06:42:31.193 --> 06:42:33.395
WORLD AND TRYING TO MANAGE ALL

06:42:33.462 --> 06:42:35.097
OF THE- CONCERNS THAT HAVE

06:42:35.164 --> 06:42:36.732
BROUGHT TO US SO WE'RE WE'RE

06:42:36.799 --> 06:42:38.167
TRYING TO PARSE SOME OF THAT

06:42:38.234 --> 06:42:39.702
OUT WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND

06:42:39.768 --> 06:42:41.136
I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO

06:42:41.203 --> 06:42:43.472
THOSE DETAILS. THANK THE CHAIR

06:42:43.539 --> 06:42:45.641
COMMENTED EARLIER WERE OFTEN

06:42:45.708 --> 06:42:47.543
PLAYING CATCH UP IN TERMS OF

06:42:47.610 --> 06:42:49.912
THE WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY MOVING

06:42:49.979 --> 06:42:52.982
FORWARD AND NEW PLATFORMS NEW

06:42:53.048 --> 06:42:57.720
METHODS OF MARKETING PRODUCTS.

06:42:57.786 --> 06:42:59.355
OUR OLD BRICK AND MORTAR LAWS

06:42:59.421 --> 06:43:01.390
DON'T ALWAYS CATCH UP OR DON'T

06:43:01.457 --> 06:43:02.892
ALWAYS SUPPLY I THINK THE

06:43:02.958 --> 06:43:07.162
AMAZON EXAMPLES. OF PEOPLE HARM

06:43:07.229 --> 06:43:09.265
TO BUYING THE PRODUCTS THEY BUY

06:43:09.331 --> 06:43:11.267
THROUGH AMAZON AMAZON IS THE

06:43:11.333 --> 06:43:13.102
SELLER EVEN IF THEY'VE BOUGHT

06:43:13.168 --> 06:43:16.705
IT FROM A MANUFACTURER- IN THAT

06:43:16.772 --> 06:43:18.274
CIRCUMSTANCE IT MAKES PERFECT

06:43:18.340 --> 06:43:20.976
SENSE TO ME THAT. THE CONSUMER

06:43:21.043 --> 06:43:23.312
SHOULD HAVE THAT REMEDY AND

06:43:23.379 --> 06:43:25.114
THAT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS SOLD

06:43:25.180 --> 06:43:30.786
BY. A SELLER WHO ALSO SELLS THE

06:43:30.853 --> 06:43:32.521
THEIR PRODUCTS NOW THAT THEY

06:43:32.588 --> 06:43:34.290
ARE THE VENDOR OF THE PRODUCT

06:43:34.356 --> 06:43:36.425
ONLINE THAT THEY SHOULD SOMEHOW

06:43:36.492 --> 06:43:38.961
BE EXEMPT FROM. THE PROTECTIONS

06:43:39.028 --> 06:43:40.496
THAT CONSUMERS FACE IF THEY

06:43:40.563 --> 06:43:42.531
BOUGHT THE SAME PRODUCT WALKING

06:43:42.598 --> 06:43:45.401
INTO A BRICK AND MORTAR. RETAIL

06:43:45.467 --> 06:43:48.103
UNITS SO- MY PREACHING OR WORK

06:43:48.170 --> 06:43:50.039
ON THIS MADAM CHAIRMAN THAT

06:43:50.105 --> 06:43:51.106
DIDN'T MOVE THE BILL AT THE

06:43:51.173 --> 06:43:52.908
APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU

06:43:52.975 --> 06:43:55.144
THANK YOU THANK YOU. SENATOR

06:43:55.210 --> 06:44:03.552
BORCHERS. THANK YOU. I'M TRYING

06:44:03.619 --> 06:44:08.591
TO UNDERSTAND. THIS ISSUE ON A

06:44:08.657 --> 06:44:12.895
COUPLE LEVELS WE DISCUSSED. A

06:44:12.962 --> 06:44:14.363
COUPLE ISSUES PRIOR WHETHER OR

06:44:14.430 --> 06:44:17.600
NOT THIS HAD- IN ADEQUATELY

06:44:17.666 --> 06:44:21.236
COVERED CONNECTION. AND IT IS

06:44:21.303 --> 06:44:23.706
IT IS IT WILL TAKE A DRINK. I'M

06:44:23.772 --> 06:44:25.474
SORRY THAT WE WILL TAKE A DRINK

06:44:25.541 --> 06:44:29.378
YES EXACTLY HA HA HA. AND IT'S

06:44:29.445 --> 06:44:31.347
FUNNY ENOUGH I THINK THIS HAS-

06:44:31.413 --> 06:44:34.450
IN ANCILLARY CONNECTION BUT

06:44:34.516 --> 06:44:35.017
IT'S NOT ONE THAT I THINK IS

06:44:35.084 --> 06:44:38.721
HELPFUL. IS THAT EARLIER WE

06:44:38.787 --> 06:44:40.089
WERE DISCUSSING ON HOW WE

06:44:40.155 --> 06:44:41.957
PROTECT HOUSES FROM BEING

06:44:42.024 --> 06:44:44.259
FORECLOSED UPON. PROTECTING

06:44:44.326 --> 06:44:46.562
RENTERS IN MAKING EMERGENCY

06:44:46.629 --> 06:44:48.297
ALLOWANCES FOR HIS

06:44:48.364 --> 06:44:50.966
EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. AND SO I'M

06:44:51.033 --> 06:44:54.003
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS.

06:44:54.069 --> 06:44:56.805
ATTACHING STRICTLY ABILITY TO A

06:44:56.872 --> 06:44:59.408
BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE THAT MAYBE

06:44:59.475 --> 06:45:01.644
HAD BRICK AND MORTAR ON MONDAY.

06:45:01.710 --> 06:45:04.980
SHUT DOWN. IT IS NOW SURVIVING

06:45:05.047 --> 06:45:08.350
WITH ONLINE SALES. I CAN I CAN

06:45:08.417 --> 06:45:10.252
IMAGINE THAT THE MARKETPLACE IS

06:45:10.319 --> 06:45:12.454
JUST FULL OF THESE INSTANCES

06:45:12.521 --> 06:45:14.156
WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE TRYING TO

06:45:14.223 --> 06:45:16.892
SURVIVE THIS PANDEMIC. AND BY

06:45:16.959 --> 06:45:18.427
ADDING IN THE STRICTLY ABILITY

06:45:18.494 --> 06:45:20.763
COMPONENT. NOT ONLY DOES OUR

06:45:20.829 --> 06:45:22.564
BUSINESS MODEL GO COULD GO

06:45:22.631 --> 06:45:24.800
SIDEWAYS I SUPPOSE THERE ARE

06:45:24.867 --> 06:45:26.168
OVERHEAD IN INSURANCE

06:45:26.235 --> 06:45:28.404
EXPECTATION WILL TAKE THEM

06:45:28.470 --> 06:45:31.640
SIDEWAYS AS WELL. IS THIS NOT

06:45:31.707 --> 06:45:34.143
MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS TO

06:45:34.209 --> 06:45:36.845
COME BACK IN JANUARY. NO SENATE

06:45:36.912 --> 06:45:39.248
BECAUSE I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE

06:45:39.314 --> 06:45:40.983
IT IS AND I WOULD ARGUE IT IS

06:45:41.050 --> 06:45:44.453
RESPECTFULLY ONLY BECAUSE WE

06:45:44.520 --> 06:45:45.087
LITERALLY SPENT FIVE AND A HALF

06:45:45.154 --> 06:45:47.456
HOURS. DECLARING HOW IMPORTANT

06:45:47.523 --> 06:45:49.224
IS WAS TO MAKE EMERGENCY

06:45:49.291 --> 06:45:51.093
ALLOWANCES FOR PEOPLE TO BE

06:45:51.160 --> 06:45:53.495
ABLE TO SURVIVE T. TO LOOK

06:45:53.562 --> 06:45:54.096
AFTER THEIR FAMILY AND STAY IN

06:45:54.163 --> 06:45:57.066
THEIR HOMES. THIS IS NOW TAKING

IT IS THE WORK THEY WORK NOW

06:47:38.534 --> 06:47:40.769

ACTUALLY MORE PROTECTIVE IN THE

06:49:01.884 --> 06:49:05.988
EBAY TO EFFECTUATE THAT AUCTION.

06:49:06.054 --> 06:49:07.522

LIKE AMAZON AND AMAZON IN ANY

06:54:00.415 --> 06:54:01.917
WHEN YOU READ THE BOLGER CASE

06:54:01.983 --> 06:54:03.451
AMAZON COMPARED ITSELF TO

06:54:03.518 --> 06:54:05.687
SHOPPING MALL. TO CREDIT CARD

06:54:05.754 --> 06:54:07.722

THE THEY TRIED ALL THOSE

06:54:12.294 --> 06:54:14.663
ARGUMENTS AND THE BOLGER COURT

06:54:14.729 --> 06:54:16.531
REJECTED THEM OUT OF HAND. I

06:54:16.598 --> 06:54:17.599
WON THE ARGUMENT SAID IT WAS A

06:54:17.666 --> 06:54:18.934
BROUGHT UP WAS WAS IF YOU

06:54:22.204 --> 06:54:25.207
CATEGORIES. AND IF A FOOTNOTE

06:54:25.273 --> 06:54:26.208
COULD CHUCKLE THE FOOTNOTE

06:54:26.274 --> 06:54:29.945
CHUCKLED SAID THE DISTANT

06:54:30.011 --> 06:54:30.545
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE ARE

06:54:30.612 --> 06:54:31.379
VERY SIGNIFICANT. I'M IS WE

06:54:31.446 --> 06:54:34.482
HAVE ONE CASE HERE THAT THIS IS

06:54:34.549 --> 06:54:37.018
BENDIS DECLINE OR DECIDED THERE

06:54:37.085 --> 06:54:38.720
WILL BE MANY MORE AND IN FACT

06:54:38.787 --> 06:54:40.789
IN THAT CASE INTERESTINGLY

06:54:40.855 --> 06:54:43.124
AMAZON CLAIMS THAT THE

06:54:43.191 --> 06:54:44.893
LEGISLATURE WOULD BE THE BEST.

06:54:44.960 --> 06:54:46.127
WOULD BE BEST POSITION TO

06:54:46.194 --> 06:54:48.730
ASSESS THE COVERING VEILING

06:54:48.797 --> 06:54:50.498

INTEREST INDIAN PRODUCTS AND

06:54:52.767 --> 06:54:54.569
ALL THAT SO AMAZON WAS ARGUING

06:54:54.636 --> 06:54:55.837
THAT THEY SHOULD COME TO THE

06:54:55.904 --> 06:54:56.471
LEGISLATURE THE COURT OF COURSE

06:54:56.538 --> 06:54:59.407
WAS OFFENDED BY THAT. AND SAID

06:54:59.474 --> 06:55:00.609
NO WE CAN DECIDE THIS JUST FIVE.

06:55:00.675 --> 06:55:01.876

GET A CLEAR PICTURE ON THAT

06:58:34.856 --> 06:58:37.125
BEFORE THE FLOOR BUT I LOOK I

06:58:37.192 --> 06:58:39.828
THINK THIS BILL ISN'T NECESSARY

06:58:39.894 --> 06:58:41.763

I SAW MISTER CAPITEC WE CARE

06:58:50.138 --> 06:58:52.740
DEEPLY ABOUT THESE- INDEPENDENT

06:58:52.807 --> 06:58:54.108
BUSINESSES OUT THERE FRANKLY

06:58:54.175 --> 06:58:56.478
AND- I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE

06:58:56.544 --> 06:58:57.178
BASICALLY PUTTING OUR

06:58:57.245 --> 06:58:58.480
INDUSTRIES AT A COMPETITIVE

06:58:58.546 --> 06:58:59.848
DISADVANTAGE AT THIS POINT IN

06:58:59.914 --> 06:59:01.950
THIS COUNTRY. WHERE A CHINESE

06:59:02.016 --> 06:59:03.818
MANUFACTURER CAN MAKE FAULTY

06:59:03.885 --> 06:59:05.553
PRODUCT AND RUN OFF SCOT FREE

06:59:05.620 --> 06:59:07.455
AT LEAST SOME OF THEM IS BOLGER

06:59:07.522 --> 06:59:08.790
WITH THE LIABILITY AND THEN

06:59:08.857 --> 06:59:10.992
MEANWHILE YOU KNOW WE START

06:59:11.059 --> 06:59:11.759
MAKING BATTERIES EVER IN

06:59:11.826 --> 06:59:14.529
CALIFORNIA AND I HOPE WE DO-

06:59:14.596 --> 06:59:16.197
YOU'RE DARN SURE WE'RE GONNA BE

06:59:16.264 --> 06:59:17.599
ABLE FOR THAT UNDER OUR STATE

06:59:17.665 --> 06:59:19.767
LAW SO I THINK THERE'S A

06:59:19.834 --> 06:59:21.836
THERE'S A FEW REASONS TO MOVE

06:59:21.903 --> 06:59:23.071
THIS FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE.

06:59:23.137 --> 06:59:24.038
THE WORK TODAY THANK YOU

06:59:24.105 --> 06:59:26.374
SENATOR IT AND POINT TO PAGE

06:59:26.441 --> 06:59:28.710
NINE OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH

06:59:28.776 --> 06:59:29.210
DESCRIBES SOME OF THE

06:59:29.277 --> 06:59:31.212
DEFINITIONS OF THE COURTS USE

06:59:31.279 --> 06:59:32.480
WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO DECIDE

06:59:32.547 --> 06:59:33.548
WHO'S GOING TO HAVE STRICT

06:59:33.615 --> 06:59:34.349
LIABILITY BECAUSE THERE ARE

06:59:34.415 --> 06:59:36.117
DEFENSES THAT A RETAILER CAN

06:59:36.184 --> 06:59:37.952
HAVE TO STRICTLY ABILITY

06:59:38.019 --> 06:59:39.287
DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT THAT

06:59:39.354 --> 06:59:41.456
THEY HAPPENED AND THEIR ROLE IN

06:59:41.523 --> 06:59:46.427
THAT PRODUCT MOVING. TO THE- TO

06:59:46.494 --> 06:59:48.129
THE CONSUMER. SO ALL OF THAT'S

06:59:48.196 --> 06:59:49.564
WHY THE STAFF. AND WE DON'T

06:59:49.631 --> 06:59:50.965
WANT INTERFERE WITH THAT

06:59:51.032 --> 06:59:52.667
BECAUSE THE COURTS WANT TO WE

06:59:52.734 --> 06:59:53.935
THINK THE COURTS NEED TO BE

06:59:54.002 --> 06:59:55.870
ABLE TO STILL USE THAT ANALYSIS

06:59:55.937 --> 06:59:58.373
AND USE THOSE TERMS. AND APPLY

06:59:58.439 --> 07:00:00.275
THEM SO ALL WE'RE SAYING IS

07:00:00.341 --> 07:00:01.175
THAT ONLINE MARKETPLACE IS A

07:00:01.242 --> 07:00:03.278
RETAILER. UNDER THIS EXISTING

07:00:03.344 --> 07:00:05.046
CONTEXT AND AS A PRACTICAL

07:00:05.113 --> 07:00:07.282
MATTER IF AMAZON DOES HAVE.

07:00:07.348 --> 07:00:10.451
SOME LIABILITY NOW. THEY WILL

07:00:10.518 --> 07:00:12.387
US AT LEAST WE ANTICIPATE

07:00:12.453 --> 07:00:14.022
THEY'LL TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE

07:00:14.088 --> 07:00:15.189
RESPONSIBILITY SO THAT WE DON'T

07:00:15.256 --> 07:00:18.159

CHINESE MANUFACTURER THEY KNOW

07:01:21.289 --> 07:01:23.224
THE CONTEXT HERE IN CALIFORNIA

CURRENT LONG ARM STATUTE

07:01:33.101 --> 07:01:34.602
WHETHER OR NOT CALIFORNIA COULD

07:01:34.669 --> 07:01:37.071
GET JURISDICTION. OVER THAT

07:01:37.138 --> 07:01:39.707
COMPANY IN CHINA OF COURSE IF

AMY'S OR SOMETHING OR A HOME

07:01:46.948 --> 07:01:50.218
DEPOT. ARGUABLY IT WOULD BE THE

07:01:50.284 --> 07:01:52.186
SAME ISSUE. WELL THAT IS TAKING

07:01:52.253 --> 07:01:53.855
A VERY SYMPATHETIC WITH ALL DUE

07:01:53.921 --> 07:01:56.057
RESPECT I THINK THAT SB THIRTY

07:01:56.124 --> 07:01:57.558
TO SIXTY TWO IS TAKING A VERY.

07:01:57.625 --> 07:02:00.828
EASY OUT. WHICH IS WHAT JUST

07:02:00.895 --> 07:02:02.430
MAKE A MALL STRICTLY LIABLE.

07:02:02.497 --> 07:02:04.098
BUT I'M NOT SURE BUT BUT BUT

07:02:04.165 --> 07:02:05.233
YOU IT RECORDS YOU HAVE

07:02:05.299 --> 07:02:06.968
RECOURSE AGAINST HOME DEPOT.

07:02:07.035 --> 07:02:09.570
WITH WHEN I. WHEN AMAZON SELLS

07:02:09.637 --> 07:02:12.106
CHAINSAWS ON LINE. OR OTHER

07:02:12.173 --> 07:02:13.374
PRODUCTS ONLINE THAT ARE

07:02:13.441 --> 07:02:15.076
MANUFACTURED IN A JURISDICTION

07:02:15.143 --> 07:02:16.978
OUTSIDE THE REACH CALIFORNIA.

07:02:17.045 --> 07:02:20.114
DO THEY INFORM THE CONSUMER

07:02:20.181 --> 07:02:20.782
THAT IF THIS THING BREAKS IF MY

07:02:20.848 --> 07:02:24.152
CHAINSAW BREAKS AND- HARMS ME.

07:02:24.218 --> 07:02:27.689
I'LL HAVE VIRTUALLY NO RECOURSE.

07:02:27.755 --> 07:02:30.858
I DON'T KNOW HOW AMAZON

07:02:30.925 --> 07:02:32.360
OPERATES EXACTLY AND I DON'T

07:02:32.427 --> 07:02:33.594
REPRESENT THEM THEY HAVE A

07:02:33.661 --> 07:02:35.063
LOBBYIST OF THEIR OWN WHO COULD

07:02:35.129 --> 07:02:36.364
PERHAPS ANSWER THAT I'M SORRY

07:02:36.431 --> 07:02:37.398
I'M PICKING ON YOU I DON'T MEAN

07:02:37.465 --> 07:02:38.566
TO PICK ON NO NOT AT ALL AYE

07:02:38.633 --> 07:02:39.701
AYE AND IF THEY DO HAVE A

07:02:39.767 --> 07:02:41.235
LOBBYIST THEIR OWN I SUSPECT

07:02:41.302 --> 07:02:42.437
THEY COULD AFFORD TO HAVE THEM

07:02:42.503 --> 07:02:43.471
HERE IN THE QUESTION THEN IS

07:02:43.538 --> 07:02:45.006
WHY AREN'T THEY HERE BECAUSE

07:02:45.073 --> 07:02:46.140
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS

07:02:46.207 --> 07:02:48.242
BILL. DOES MENTION THEM SEVERAL

07:02:48.309 --> 07:02:50.178
TIMES FOR JUST THE REASON I

07:02:50.244 --> 07:02:51.846
THINK THAT SENATOR UMBERG

07:02:51.913 --> 07:02:54.515
MENTIONED IS THAT. THEY WOULD

07:02:54.582 --> 07:02:55.783
THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE SELLING

07:02:55.850 --> 07:02:58.953
THEIR CHAINSAW SO THE QUESTION

07:02:59.020 --> 07:03:01.456
IS WHAT WOULD THEY WOULD THEY

07:03:01.522 --> 07:03:03.124
HAVE ANY LIABILITY IN AND IF

07:03:03.191 --> 07:03:04.859
THEY FEEL THAT THEY DON'T ON

07:03:04.926 --> 07:03:06.060
WHAT BASIS DO THEY FEEL THEY

07:03:06.127 --> 07:03:08.029
DON'T OR DO THEY INFORM THE

07:03:08.096 --> 07:03:09.630
CONSUMER OR DO THEY INFORM TO

07:03:09.697 --> 07:03:13.835
CONSULT THE- CONCERN THAT I

07:03:13.901 --> 07:03:16.170
HAVE. IS THAT. IN THE BILL- AS

07:03:16.237 --> 07:03:18.372
I UNDERSTAND SEWER STONE. YOU

07:03:18.439 --> 07:03:19.974
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

07:03:20.041 --> 07:03:22.577
CRAIGS LIST CROWD. IS NOT

07:03:22.643 --> 07:03:25.012
CAPTURED BY THIS BILL WHERE YOU

07:03:25.079 --> 07:03:27.515
HAVE DIRECT CONSUMER CONSUMER-

07:03:27.582 --> 07:03:29.751
INTERACTION WHERE THE PLATFORM

07:03:29.817 --> 07:03:31.886
MERE IT MERELY ACTS AS A

07:03:31.953 --> 07:03:34.622
CONDUIT NOT. A OR A FACILITATOR

07:03:34.689 --> 07:03:37.458
VERSUS AN AMAZON TYPE MODEL IF

07:03:37.525 --> 07:03:38.626
I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WHAT

07:03:38.693 --> 07:03:40.695
WE'RE TRYING TO IN ENSURE THAT

07:03:40.762 --> 07:03:42.663
WHERE. A CRAIGSLIST WHICH ACTS

07:03:42.730 --> 07:03:44.799
LIKE A CLASSIFIED AD SECTION

07:03:44.866 --> 07:03:46.100
TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF REVENUE

07:03:46.167 --> 07:03:47.468
AS A NEWSPAPER WOULD WHEN THEY

07:03:47.535 --> 07:03:49.504
DO CLASSIFIED ADS BUT THE

07:03:49.570 --> 07:03:51.773
TRANSACTION THEN HAPPENS

07:03:51.839 --> 07:03:53.574
HUNDRED PERCENT. OUTSIDE OF THE

07:03:53.641 --> 07:03:55.243
SPHERE THEY DON'T CARE THEY

07:03:55.309 --> 07:03:56.711
DON'T HAVE ANY ROLE IN THAT.

07:03:56.778 --> 07:03:58.246
THAT CLASSIFIED ADS TYPE

07:03:58.312 --> 07:04:00.715
TRANSACTION WHICH DOES TEND TO

07:04:00.782 --> 07:04:02.884
BE. SOME PEOPLE SELLING USED

07:04:02.950 --> 07:04:04.519
PRODUCTS ARE HAVE TOO MANY

07:04:04.585 --> 07:04:06.888
THINGS IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT MEANT

07:04:06.954 --> 07:04:08.856
TO BE A MAJOR COMMERCIAL

07:04:08.923 --> 07:04:10.525
DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM TO THE

07:04:10.591 --> 07:04:12.160
EXTENT THAT IT BECOMES A MAJOR

07:04:12.226 --> 07:04:14.095
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION.

07:04:14.162 --> 07:04:15.463
MECHANISM LIKE THE AT SEASON

07:04:15.530 --> 07:04:16.564
EBAY'S HAVE BECOME BECAUSE

07:04:16.631 --> 07:04:18.232
THEY'VE MOVED ON BEYOND THE

07:04:18.299 --> 07:04:19.834
PURE AUCTION SITE AND IF YOU'RE

07:04:19.901 --> 07:04:22.170
CRAFTING SITE. WHICH IS HOW

07:04:22.236 --> 07:04:25.139
THEY STARTED THEN THEY COULD BE

07:04:25.206 --> 07:04:26.040
SUBJECT TO THIS BILL HERE'S

07:04:26.107 --> 07:04:28.743
HERE'S MY CONCERN IS BOTH FOR

07:04:28.810 --> 07:04:30.478
THE COURTS AS WELL AS FOR.

07:04:30.545 --> 07:04:31.879
SOMEONE WHO'S THINKING ABOUT

07:04:31.946 --> 07:04:34.515
ENTERING THE SPACE IT IS THAT

07:04:34.582 --> 07:04:37.018
IN OTHER IS THE LAW. WE HAVE

07:04:37.084 --> 07:04:39.453
GUIDANCE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU

07:04:39.520 --> 07:04:45.326
WANT TO FORM. YOU CAN SEE HERE

07:04:45.393 --> 07:04:46.394
HERE ARE THE FACTORS THE

07:04:46.460 --> 07:04:47.628
COURT'S GOING TO LOOK AT TO SEE

07:04:47.695 --> 07:04:49.130
WHETHER YOU'RE PROTECTED IF YOU

07:04:49.197 --> 07:04:51.065
WANT TO MAINTAIN YOUR PRESENCE

07:04:51.132 --> 07:04:52.834
OUTSIDE THE CALIFORNIA. TERMS A

07:04:52.900 --> 07:04:54.302
MINIMUM CONTACTS HERE'S

07:04:54.368 --> 07:04:55.536
BASICALLY THE CHECKLIST THAT

07:04:55.603 --> 07:04:58.506
YOU CAN LOOK AT. SO IS YOU AND

07:04:58.573 --> 07:05:00.341
I DISCUSSED I THINK IT WOULD BE

07:05:00.408 --> 07:05:01.909
USEFUL TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF

07:05:01.976 --> 07:05:03.377
GUIDANCE BOTH TO THE COURTS AS

07:05:03.444 --> 07:05:06.113
WELL AS TO. POTENTIAL

07:05:06.180 --> 07:05:07.448
ENTREPRENEURS WHO WENT INTO

07:05:07.515 --> 07:05:10.852
THAT SPACE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF

07:05:10.918 --> 07:05:13.754
YOU. ARE DONE NOT PROHIBITING

07:05:13.821 --> 07:05:15.957
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SELLER

07:05:16.023 --> 07:05:18.092
AND BUYER. THAT WOULD BE ONE

07:05:18.159 --> 07:05:20.561
FACTOR IF YOU ARE NOT PROVIDING

07:05:20.628 --> 07:05:22.330
MODES OF TRANSPORTATION IF THE

07:05:22.396 --> 07:05:23.831
IF THE EXCHANGE HAPPENS THROUGH

07:05:23.898 --> 07:05:26.901
A THIRD PARTY VENDOR COMPLETELY

07:05:26.968 --> 07:05:28.636
THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER FACTOR IF

07:05:28.703 --> 07:05:31.272
FOR EXAMPLE. YOU LIST THE

07:05:31.339 --> 07:05:34.108
LOCATION N. DO DISCLOSE THE

07:05:34.175 --> 07:05:35.343
CONSUMER THAT THAT YOU ARE

07:05:35.409 --> 07:05:37.511
SIMPLY A CONDUIT THAT WOULD BE

07:05:37.578 --> 07:05:39.013
ANOTHER FACTOR SO IF WE PROVIDE

07:05:39.080 --> 07:05:41.849
FACTORS SO THAT THE CRAIGS LIST

07:05:41.916 --> 07:05:43.718
AND- TO THE EXTENT THAT. THE

07:05:43.784 --> 07:05:45.953
DEAD SEA IS WANTS TO MOVE BACK

07:05:46.020 --> 07:05:47.622
INTO THE REALM WHERE THEY ARE

07:05:47.688 --> 07:05:49.390
MORE CRAIG'S LIST D. VERSUS

07:05:49.457 --> 07:05:52.260
MORE AMAZON E. THEY CAN DO THAT

07:05:52.326 --> 07:05:54.762
THAT WE ACTUALLY GIVE SOME SORT

07:05:54.829 --> 07:05:57.031
OF. GUIDANCE AND SO I KNOW YOU

07:05:57.098 --> 07:05:57.832
AND I TALKED ABOUT WORKING ON

07:05:57.899 --> 07:06:00.301
THAT AND- YET WE TALKED ABOUT

07:06:00.368 --> 07:06:01.135
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT A

07:06:01.202 --> 07:06:02.603
LITTLE BIT MORE. AND IF YOU

07:06:02.670 --> 07:06:03.838
LOOK AT THE JURISPRUDENCE

07:06:03.905 --> 07:06:05.907
AROUND STRICT LIABILITY. FOR

07:06:05.973 --> 07:06:08.743
EXAMPLE IN THE BASE SUMMIT CASE

07:06:08.809 --> 07:06:10.611
THE COURT SISTER CLUB BILLY

07:06:10.678 --> 07:06:12.013
ALSO APPLIES WEARING NON

07:06:12.079 --> 07:06:13.247
MANUFACTURING PARTY IS THE

07:06:13.314 --> 07:06:15.650
VERDICT CHEYNA DISTRIBUTION. OF

07:06:15.716 --> 07:06:16.784
THE PRODUCT PLAYS AN INTEGRAL

07:06:16.851 --> 07:06:18.386
ROLE IN THE PRODUCING AND

07:06:18.452 --> 07:06:19.553
MARKETING ENTERPRISE OF A

07:06:19.620 --> 07:06:21.122
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND PROFITS

07:06:21.188 --> 07:06:22.823
FROM THE PLACING OF THE PRODUCT

07:06:22.890 --> 07:06:25.726
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE. SO IN A

07:06:25.793 --> 07:06:27.094
LOT OF THE STATEMENTS IN THE

07:06:27.161 --> 07:06:28.029
JURISPRUDENCE IN THE VARIOUS

07:06:28.095 --> 07:06:29.997
CASES THERE ARE EXACTLY THOSE

07:06:30.064 --> 07:06:35.870
TESTS. I WORRY ABOUT. CREATING

07:06:35.937 --> 07:06:37.171
BECAUSE IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

07:06:37.238 --> 07:06:40.341
TO CREATE THESE DISTINCTIONS

07:06:40.408 --> 07:06:42.143
AROUND ONLINE MARKETPLACES

07:06:42.209 --> 07:06:44.445
BECAUSE THEN THE NEXT TYPE OF

07:06:44.512 --> 07:06:45.813
BUSINESS MODEL THAT COMES UP

07:06:45.880 --> 07:06:47.381
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CREATE A

07:06:47.448 --> 07:06:49.417
NEW SET OF LISTS FOR THEM I

07:06:49.483 --> 07:06:51.452
THINK WE CAN RELIABLY RELY ON

07:06:51.519 --> 07:06:52.954
WHAT THE COURTS HAVE DONE IN

07:06:53.020 --> 07:06:53.721
THE JURISPRUDENCE AROUND STRICT

07:06:53.788 --> 07:06:56.357
LIABILITY AND BY SAYING IF YOU

07:06:56.424 --> 07:06:59.393
ARE BRINGING THE PRODUCT INTO

07:06:59.460 --> 07:07:01.329
CALIFORNIA FACILITATING THAT

07:07:01.395 --> 07:07:01.862
BRING THAT PRODUCT TO THE

07:07:01.929 --> 07:07:04.332
CALIFORNIA. BY THESE EXISTING

07:07:04.398 --> 07:07:07.635
STANDARDS YOUR RETAILER AND

07:07:07.702 --> 07:07:09.403
WHEN YOU'RE A RETAILER WE KNOW

07:07:09.470 --> 07:07:11.505
WHAT THAT MEANS AND- BY THE WAY

07:07:11.572 --> 07:07:12.440
BEING A RETAILER UNDER STRICT

07:07:12.506 --> 07:07:15.109
LIABILITY HAS SEVERAL DEFENSES

07:07:15.176 --> 07:07:16.911
TO IT THAT THAT RETAILER CAN

07:07:16.978 --> 07:07:18.145
BRING UP AND SAY YOU CAN'T

07:07:18.212 --> 07:07:19.347
TREAT I DON'T GET STRICT

07:07:19.413 --> 07:07:21.649
LIABILITY THIS CASE BECAUSE

07:07:21.716 --> 07:07:22.516
THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE

07:07:22.583 --> 07:07:25.987
BRICK AND MORTAR. THAT CAN

07:07:26.053 --> 07:07:26.687
HAPPEN IN AN ONLINE. MARKET

07:07:26.754 --> 07:07:28.823
PLACE IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE

07:07:28.889 --> 07:07:30.391
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT

07:07:30.458 --> 07:07:31.425
WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO

07:07:31.492 --> 07:07:33.094
TREAT. THESE ONLINE

07:07:33.160 --> 07:07:35.229
MARKETPLACES THE SAME IS WE'VE

07:07:35.296 --> 07:07:37.665
TREATED. THE BRICK AND MORTAR

07:07:37.732 --> 07:07:39.900
COMPANIES FOR DECADES. IN A

07:07:39.967 --> 07:07:41.702
STRICT LIABILITY CONTACTS BUT

07:07:41.769 --> 07:07:44.572
I. AND I AGREE WITH YOU WE WANT

07:07:44.638 --> 07:07:46.841
TO TREAT AN AMAZON. LIKE A

07:07:46.907 --> 07:07:48.576
BRICK AND MORTAR ENTITY YEAH

07:07:48.642 --> 07:07:49.844
BUT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

07:07:49.910 --> 07:07:51.879
DIFFERENT MODELS IN THERE MAYBE

07:07:51.946 --> 07:07:53.647
IN THE FUTURE DIFFERENT MODELS.

07:07:53.714 --> 07:07:56.650
THAT WE DO THAT I DISAGREE I

07:07:56.717 --> 07:07:57.752
THINK WE SHOULD DISTINGUISH I

07:07:57.818 --> 07:07:59.687
THINK WE SHOULD. SET OUT SOME

07:07:59.754 --> 07:08:01.422
PARAMETERS SO THAT THERE IS

07:08:01.489 --> 07:08:03.791
SOME STABILITY SO THAT SO THAT

07:08:03.858 --> 07:08:05.292
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO COME INTO

07:08:05.359 --> 07:08:07.495
THE SPACE. CAN LEAST HAVE SOME

07:08:07.561 --> 07:08:09.397
GUIDANCE. BUT IF WE'RE SIMPLY

07:08:09.463 --> 07:08:11.032
GONNA LEAVE IT UP TO THE COURTS

07:08:11.098 --> 07:08:12.466
TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW GO AHEAD

07:08:12.533 --> 07:08:14.001
TAKE YOUR CHANCES AND SEE WHAT

07:08:14.068 --> 07:08:14.802
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

07:08:14.869 --> 07:08:17.438
SAYS. I THINK THAT NHIBITS I

07:08:17.505 --> 07:08:18.506
THINK THAT INHIBITS

07:08:18.572 --> 07:08:20.307
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND I THINK IT

07:08:20.374 --> 07:08:22.843
INHIBITS- THE ABILITY FOR

07:08:22.910 --> 07:08:24.478
CONSUMERS ACTUALLY INTERACT

07:08:24.545 --> 07:08:25.546
WITH ONE ANOTHER THAT'S MY

07:08:25.613 --> 07:08:29.650
VIEW- IT CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

07:08:29.717 --> 07:08:30.851
BUT IT EXCUSE ME. BUT LET'S

07:08:30.918 --> 07:08:32.086
STOP FOR A SECOND I'LL LET YOU

07:08:32.153 --> 07:08:34.155
ANSWER THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES BUT

07:08:34.221 --> 07:08:35.623
I DON'T WANT TO. ENGAGE IN ANY

07:08:35.689 --> 07:08:38.793
FURTHER COLLOQUY HERE I THINK

07:08:38.859 --> 07:08:41.595
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE. TO

07:08:41.662 --> 07:08:44.131
DECIDE IN THE AUTHORS TAKEN

07:08:44.198 --> 07:08:46.734
RESOLVE THOSE QUESTIONS A CORD

07:08:46.801 --> 07:08:48.335
STILL HAS THE DISCRETION TO

07:08:48.402 --> 07:08:49.837
ENSURE THE LONG STANDING

07:08:49.904 --> 07:08:51.772
PRINCIPLES. OF STRICT LIABILITY

07:08:51.839 --> 07:08:55.109
APPLY. SO THERE WILL BE IN SOME

07:08:55.176 --> 07:08:58.679
INSTANCES. THE OPPORTUNITY TO

07:08:58.746 --> 07:09:00.781
ASSERT THOSE DEFENSES AS HAVE

07:09:00.848 --> 07:09:03.117
ALWAYS BEEN ASSERTED. WE ARE

07:09:03.184 --> 07:09:06.320
JUST TRYING NOW TO ANALOGIZE.

07:09:06.387 --> 07:09:09.690
AND TO PUT INTO THE SAME

07:09:09.757 --> 07:09:13.594
FRAMEWORK. THE ONLINE PLATFORMS

07:09:13.661 --> 07:09:16.497
AS THEY DO BUSINESS S. AS WE

07:09:16.564 --> 07:09:18.099
HAVE WITH THE BRICK AND MORTAR

07:09:18.165 --> 07:09:20.501
AND- WITH THE WITH THE

07:09:20.568 --> 07:09:21.902
DISTINCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

07:09:21.969 --> 07:09:24.572
DRAWN BETWEEN. THOSE WHO ARE

07:09:24.638 --> 07:09:26.307
SELLING SECOND HAND PRODUCTS OR

07:09:26.373 --> 07:09:28.709
JUST DOING ADVERTISING CLEARLY

07:09:28.776 --> 07:09:31.912
THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME.

07:09:31.979 --> 07:09:34.081
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

07:09:34.148 --> 07:09:36.417
THEY ARE THE SAME IN CERTAIN

07:09:36.484 --> 07:09:38.552
DUTIES THE SALE THE RETAIL

07:09:38.619 --> 07:09:40.421
ASPECTS OF WHAT A BRICK AND

07:09:40.488 --> 07:09:43.057
MORTAR STORES AND WHAT AN-

07:09:43.124 --> 07:09:45.593
ONLINE MARKET PLACES THEY WILL

07:09:45.659 --> 07:09:47.328
BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS

07:09:47.394 --> 07:09:48.929
AND IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THEY

07:09:48.996 --> 07:09:51.198
ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME.

07:09:51.265 --> 07:09:54.602
THE AMENDMENTS AGAIN GIVE THE

07:09:54.668 --> 07:09:57.138
COURTS THE DISCRETION TO APPLY

07:09:57.204 --> 07:09:58.606
STRICT LIABILITY WERE

07:09:58.672 --> 07:10:00.241
APPROPRIATE AND THERE WILL

07:10:00.307 --> 07:10:02.409
ALWAYS BE LAWSUIT SO SENATOR

07:10:02.476 --> 07:10:04.478
UMBERG WHEN HE DECIDED HAD

07:10:04.545 --> 07:10:05.045
ENOUGH OF THIS PLACE AND GO

07:10:05.112 --> 07:10:07.414
BACK TO PRACTICING LAW BE SOME

07:10:07.481 --> 07:10:09.650
GOOD LITIGATION FOR YOU TO. TO

07:10:09.717 --> 07:10:12.119
PURSUE BUT- THE I THINK THE

07:10:12.186 --> 07:10:14.088
AMENDMENTS GIVE DISCRETION TO

07:10:14.155 --> 07:10:15.489
LOOK AT WHETHER THE FACTS OF

07:10:15.556 --> 07:10:17.224
THE CASE JUSTIFIES STRICKLAND

07:10:17.291 --> 07:10:23.230
ABILITY OR DO NOT IT JUST. PUTS

07:10:23.297 --> 07:10:23.831
IT IN THE SAME POSITION BRICK

07:10:23.898 --> 07:10:24.431

07:10:26.200 --> 07:10:31.138
I HAVE- CONCERNS- THAT I THINK

07:10:31.205 --> 07:10:33.407
CAN GET RESOLVED- AND MAYBE NOT

07:10:33.474 --> 07:10:34.141
BUT I THINK THEY CAN GET

07:10:34.208 --> 07:10:35.943
RESOLVED AND I HOPE WE CAN

07:10:36.010 --> 07:10:37.178
CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF

07:10:37.244 --> 07:10:38.679
THOSE CONCERNS BEFORE THIS HITS

NECESSARY TO. EVERYONE PRIOR TO

07:11:03.270 --> 07:11:04.238
THE CLOSE OF SESSION. EIGHT

THE ASSUMPTION THAT SOME

07:11:14.882 --> 07:11:16.817
CHANGES WILL BE MADE BUT THOSE

07:11:16.884 --> 07:11:18.052
CHANGES MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BE

07:11:18.118 --> 07:11:20.421
MADE. WELL I AM NOT CONVINCED

07:11:20.487 --> 07:11:21.789
THOSE CHANGES ARE NECESSARY

07:11:21.855 --> 07:11:24.091
OKAY BUT IF I AM CONVINCED OF

07:11:24.158 --> 07:11:26.227
THOSE CHANGES ARE NECESSARY YES

07:11:26.293 --> 07:11:28.796
WE DO IN FACT HAVE TIME. IN

07:11:28.862 --> 07:11:30.497
THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S GOD THAT

07:11:30.564 --> 07:11:31.999
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO

07:11:32.066 --> 07:11:33.434
JUST HAVE ONE BILL. ON THIS

07:11:33.500 --> 07:11:35.302
THERE WILL BE AS THE MARKET

07:11:35.369 --> 07:11:36.737
PLACE CHANGES AS WE SEE

07:11:36.804 --> 07:11:39.740
TECHNOLOGY. MOVING DIRECTIONS

07:11:39.807 --> 07:11:41.542
SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN CAMPAIGN TO

07:11:41.609 --> 07:11:44.478
IS PAID I'M SURE THESE ISSUES

07:11:44.545 --> 07:11:46.146
WILL BE. BROUGHT UP. IN

07:11:46.213 --> 07:11:47.615
WHATEVER ITERATION WE FIND

07:11:47.681 --> 07:11:49.283
OURSELVES I MEAN I DON'T KNOW

07:11:49.350 --> 07:11:51.151
ABOUT YOU BUT- LEARNING WOOD

07:11:51.218 --> 07:11:53.687
GIGABYTES ARE AND ALL THIS KIND

07:11:53.754 --> 07:11:55.656
OF SERVICE SOMETHING I. NEVER

07:11:55.723 --> 07:11:58.459
KNEW AND WAS NEVER ANTICIPATED

07:11:58.525 --> 07:11:59.727
THAT WE WOULD BE LEARNING ABOUT

07:11:59.793 --> 07:12:01.629
THEM SO I ASSUME THEY'LL BE THE

07:12:01.695 --> 07:12:04.732
NEXT ITERATION. OF THESE KINDS

07:12:04.798 --> 07:12:07.635
OF PLATFORMS- IN THAT THERE

07:12:07.701 --> 07:12:09.203
WILL BE NEW THINGS THAT COME UP

07:12:09.270 --> 07:12:10.871
WHAT WHAT THIS BILL I THINK

07:12:10.938 --> 07:12:12.506
TRIES TO DO IS TO PUT IN A

07:12:12.573 --> 07:12:16.110
FRAMEWORK- THE LOSS OF ABOUT

07:12:16.176 --> 07:12:18.078
STRICTLY ABILITY THAT APPLY.

07:12:18.145 --> 07:12:20.381
EVEN THOUGH THESE MARKET PLACES

07:12:20.447 --> 07:12:23.017
ARE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN

07:12:23.083 --> 07:12:25.152
CONCEPT. THERE ARE NO BRICK AND

07:12:25.219 --> 07:12:26.453
MORTAR SHE GO ON TO YOUR

07:12:26.520 --> 07:12:28.289
COMPUTER YOU CAN ORDER BIRTHDAY

07:12:28.355 --> 07:12:30.391
CARDS GREAT IDEA FOR FAMILY

07:12:30.457 --> 07:12:32.293
THAT YOU. YOU DON'T WANT TO

07:12:32.359 --> 07:12:33.360
SENDING BACK THE GIFT YOU GIVE

07:12:33.427 --> 07:12:34.928
THEM SO YOU GIVE A GIFT CARD

07:12:34.995 --> 07:12:37.264
YOU CAN DO THAT IN. GET OFF TWO

07:12:37.331 --> 07:12:40.100
MINUTES- NOT ANYTHING YOU EVER

07:12:40.167 --> 07:12:42.269
THOUGHT OF BEFORE. BUT WHEN IT

07:12:42.336 --> 07:12:43.637
COMES TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC

07:12:43.704 --> 07:12:45.272
AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THERE

07:12:45.339 --> 07:12:46.740
ARE SOME BASIC FUNDAMENTAL

07:12:46.807 --> 07:12:47.708
PRINCIPLES AND THAT'S WHAT I%

07:12:47.775 --> 07:12:49.777
THINK THIS BILL. TRIES TO DEAL

07:12:49.843 --> 07:12:51.345
WITH SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO

07:12:51.412 --> 07:12:53.814
CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE I

07:12:53.881 --> 07:12:57.017
THINK OF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

07:12:57.084 --> 07:12:59.219
CONCLUDED CAN I THINK. WE'RE SO

07:12:59.286 --> 07:13:00.154
IN LOVE WITH THIS NOTION OF

07:13:00.220 --> 07:13:02.156
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE THINK THAT'S

07:13:02.222 --> 07:13:03.991
THE ONLY INNOVATION THAT HAS

07:13:04.058 --> 07:13:06.760
HAPPENED IT HASN'T AND IF YOU

07:13:06.827 --> 07:13:07.328
LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF

07:13:07.394 --> 07:13:08.595
GOODS. AND HOW PRODUCTS GET TO

07:13:08.662 --> 07:13:10.898
MARKET OVER MELANIA IT'S

07:13:10.964 --> 07:13:12.866
CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY. WE

07:13:12.933 --> 07:13:13.567
WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS

07:13:13.634 --> 07:13:14.902
CONVERSATION WHEN YOU TALK

07:13:14.968 --> 07:13:16.470
ABOUT THE AMWAY MODEL

07:13:16.537 --> 07:13:17.871
DISTRIBUTION WE WOULD BE HAVING

07:13:17.938 --> 07:13:19.406
THIS CONVERSATION. IF YOU LOOK

07:13:19.473 --> 07:13:20.908
AT AVON AND SOME OF THAT THE

07:13:20.974 --> 07:13:22.309
INTERESTING KINDS OF THINGS

07:13:22.376 --> 07:13:23.844
THAT ENTREPRENEURS CAME UP

07:13:23.911 --> 07:13:26.547
WITH. WITHOUT THESE. NEW TOOLS.

07:13:26.613 --> 07:13:27.981
THESE ARE JUST NEW TOOLS THAT

07:13:28.048 --> 07:13:29.683
THEY DON'T CREATE. ANYTHING

07:13:29.750 --> 07:13:32.753
ELSE IT ULTIMATELY NEW EXCEPT

07:13:32.820 --> 07:13:34.088
FOR THE ABILITY TO MORE QUICKLY.

07:13:34.154 --> 07:13:35.422
COME UP WITH DIFFERENT WAYS OF

07:13:35.489 --> 07:13:37.791
DISTRIBUTING SO I THINK IT'S UP

07:13:37.858 --> 07:13:40.194
TO US. TO NOT INHIBIT. THAT

07:13:40.260 --> 07:13:42.129
ENTREPRENEURIAL IS A TEN NOT

07:13:42.196 --> 07:13:44.098
INHIBIT THOSE IDEAS BUT BE VERY

07:13:44.164 --> 07:13:46.700
CLEAR. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

07:13:46.767 --> 07:13:48.836
DOES IS IF YOU'RE FACILITATING

07:13:48.902 --> 07:13:50.504
BRING PRODUCT IN THE CALIFORNIA

07:13:50.571 --> 07:13:52.005
AND IT'S DANGEROUS YOU CAN BE

07:13:52.072 --> 07:13:53.741
SUBJECT TO STRICT LIABILITY.

07:13:53.807 --> 07:13:55.309
ESPECIALLY WHEN IN THE COURTS

07:13:55.376 --> 07:13:56.944
ARE CLEAR ABOUT THIS ESPECIALLY

07:13:57.010 --> 07:13:57.511
WHEN THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER

07:13:57.578 --> 07:14:01.281
AVENUE. TO SEEK REDRESS. THAT'S

07:14:01.348 --> 07:14:01.882
ONE OF THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

07:14:01.949 --> 07:14:03.650
FACTORS THECOURT'S USE TWENTY

07:14:03.717 --> 07:14:04.985
THINK COURTS REALLY DO HAVE

07:14:05.052 --> 07:14:06.153
FACTORS TO BE LOOKED AT IN

07:14:06.220 --> 07:14:08.188
INDIVIDUAL CASE. AND WE WANT

07:14:08.255 --> 07:14:09.723
THEM TO OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

07:14:09.790 --> 07:14:11.058
AMEND THE STATUTE AND AMEND THE

07:14:11.125 --> 07:14:12.459
STATUTE AND THE STATUTE AND

07:14:12.526 --> 07:14:13.394
IT'S GOING TO BE A THOUSAND

07:14:13.460 --> 07:14:16.430
PAGES. LONG AS NEW BUSINESS
