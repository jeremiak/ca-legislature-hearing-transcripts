LOOKS LIKE IN A CLINICAL

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:23.600
SETTING IS WOMEN ASKING FOR

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:24.734

THAT'S INJECTED ONCE EVERY

00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:33.176
THREE MONTHS SO THAT OUR

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:37.414
BIRTH CONTROL PILLS OR POKE

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.082

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:49.359
BECAUSE THEY STILL NEED TO HAVE

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:50.860
A PERIOD OTHERWISE THEIR

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:51.962

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:54.864

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS

DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:01.871
MONOGAMOUS NOT HAVING SEX WITH

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.873
ANYBODY ELSE. BECAUSE THEIR

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.108
PARTNER HAD MULTIPLE OTHER

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:07.477

THE PROCEDURE WITHOUT PAIN

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.986

PAIN MEDICATION YOU NEED A

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:19.623

THEIR PARTNERS COME HOME FOR

00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:33.803
FEAR OF AROUSING SUSPICION. DO

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:34.471
THEY GO WITHOUT PAIN MEDICATION.

00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:35.705

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:12.580
SERIAL NON COMPLIANCE WITH SOME

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:13.815
OF THESE DIFFERENT

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:15.983
MUNICIPALITIES IN DIFFERENT

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:18.219
DIVISIONS AND SO ON SO FORTH.

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:18.786
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S A

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:21.656
SITUATION WHERE- A COMPLIANCE

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:24.225
INCENTIVE OR MANDATE WOULD

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:27.028
YIELD THE RESULT THAT YOU WANT.

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:28.963
THAT ALLOWS FOR THIS

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:30.965
INFORMATION TO BE COLLECTED FOR

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.967
LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES-

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:34.569
BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY HAS HAS

01:29:34.635 --> 01:29:37.538
MERIT. IN THE TIME LINE WITHIN

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:38.072
WHICH THAT INFORMATION BE

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:41.409
STORED. AND DISCLOSED TO THIRD

01:29:41.476 --> 01:29:43.177
PARTIES ASSUMING THAT THERE ARE

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:45.079
CONFIDENTIALITY PROTOCOLS IN

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:47.548
PLACE SUCH THAT IF A FINE WERE

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.817
IN PLACE. WOULD THAT NOT

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:52.253
RESOLVE. ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES

01:29:52.320 --> 01:30:03.397
HERE. HI YES SO- EVENTS OF

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:06.501
QUESTION CORRECTLY- TWO THINGS

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:07.301
WE LEARNED TWO THINGS FROM THE

01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:10.238
AUDIT WE LEARNED THAT- ASPECTS

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:12.607
OF THE INDUSTRY THIRTY FOUR I

01:30:12.673 --> 01:30:13.641
THINK IT WAS OBSERVE THE CENTER

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:15.777
HELD BILL- WERE NOT BEING

01:30:15.843 --> 01:30:17.612
COMPLIED WITH BUT WE ALSO

01:30:17.678 --> 01:30:18.546
LEARNED THAT THE ISSUES GO

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:21.415
BEYOND WHAT THAT BILL. I'VE

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:23.885
DEALT WITH SAID THAT THE REALLY

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:26.788
DRAMATIC INCREASE USE OF LPR

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:29.023
BY MORE MORE AGENCIES AND

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:30.658
LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOW THE

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:32.059
DATA WAS BEING USER FRIENDLY

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:35.062
MISUSED- SHOWED US THAT WE NEED

01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:37.031
TO BUILD UPON THE WORK OF IN

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:38.833
ADDITION TO GETTING COMPLIANCE

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.301
BUT ACTUALLY BUILDING ON IT.

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:42.336
AND IT'S QUITE LIMITED WHAT

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:44.071
WE'RE DOING RIGHT THIS IS NOT A

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:47.508
KITCHEN SINK BILL REQUIRING.

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:48.409
THE W. RETURNS PERIOD LIKE I

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:49.844
SAID FLEXIBLE AND FOR FOUR HOUR

01:30:49.911 --> 01:30:51.212
AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:53.548
ON THAT. AND THEN YOU KNOW

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:54.682
AUDITING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:56.150
BEEN COMPLY BECAUSE THE AUDIT

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:57.652
PART WHICH IS RECOMMENDED BY

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:59.887
THE ORDER. GIVEN THAT WE SAW SO

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.689
MUCH NON COMPLIANCE BEFORE WE

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:03.090
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:04.725
AN ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM AND

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:06.761
THEN REQUIRING. OF THE

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:07.361
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO HELP

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:10.164
CITIES COMPLY WITH TEMPLATES.

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:11.732
SO WE THINK IT'S A PRETTY-

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:15.002
MEASURED RESPONSE. TO WHAT'S

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:17.371
INCREASINGLY- REALLY

01:31:17.438 --> 01:31:18.906
PROBLEMATIC SITUATION TRUMP

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:21.042
VERY TROUBLING. THAT AGENCIES

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:23.411
ARE DOING US. IN THAT'S IN

01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:24.846
ANYTHING YOU CAN HEAR MY

01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:28.549
CONCERN- ON THIS ISSUE IS.

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:30.051
INTUITIVELY I WOULD THINK THAT

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:32.687
THERE WOULD BE WAYS- WE'RE

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:34.355
PRIVACY COULD BE PROTECTED TO

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:35.990
SOME DEGREE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:37.959
INTERESTS. HE LOOKED AFTER TO

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:40.795
SOME DEGREE- THE TWENTY FOUR

01:31:40.862 --> 01:31:42.363
HOUR RULE I THINK IF WE JUST

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:43.998
FROM MY FROM MY STANDPOINT. I

01:31:44.065 --> 01:31:45.867
KNOW YOU'RE CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:31:45.933 --> 01:31:49.237
THAT I HOPE YOU DO- IT. IN IN

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:52.406
IN REAL LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:53.908
ALWAYS DOES IT MOVE THAT

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:54.609
QUICKLY IN TERMS OF

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:56.711
INVESTIGATION. AND I'D IN

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:58.946
REFINEMENT OF FOLKS. TO LOOK

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:00.715
AFTER OR PERSONS OF INTEREST.

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:02.316
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:32:02.383 --> 01:32:04.986
CHALLENGE IN FACT. IF CHP'S

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:06.787
DOING IT FOR SIXTY DAYS- I

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:07.955
THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:09.857
BE COULD BE HELPFUL OR SOME.

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:12.326
SOME TIME PERIOD LIKE THAT. AND

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:14.362
A FINANCIAL PENALTY OR SOME

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:17.398
SORT OF REGULATORY PENALTY FOR.

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:19.166
THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS

01:32:19.233 --> 01:32:20.635
INFORMATION FOR UNINTENDED

01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:22.536
PURPOSES. THAT DOESN'T SEEM

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:24.872
RIGHT TO ME. IF IT IS INDEED

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:27.041
GOING TO THIRD PARTIES- THAT DO

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:29.210
NOT HAVE THE AUTHORIZATION TO

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:31.913
USE THAT- I KNOW I KNOW THIS

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:33.180
SEEMS TO BE A WORK IN PROGRESS

01:32:33.247 --> 01:32:34.282
IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:36.484
MODIFIED IS. IS TIMELY TIMES GO

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:38.386
ON BUT IF THAT IS SOMETHING

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:40.187
THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER- I'M

01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:41.422
I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU THAT YOU

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:42.924
WOULD. TAKE TAKE A GANDER AT

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:47.929
SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE.

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:48.496
POINTS ON BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:49.163
BALANCE. RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:49.830
IN BAD BY MAYBE A SOME POINT AT

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.499
LEAST IN MY- IT COULD BE A

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:53.668
BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY AND-

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:55.503

AGENCIES I THINK THE HIGHWAY

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.355
PATROL SAID SIXTY DAYS BUT I

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:15.489
THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:33:15.556 --> 01:33:17.325
AND I. I INTEND TO SUPPORT THE

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:19.460
BILL- THE FACT THAT THI

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:21.395
LEGISLATION HAS BEEN IN EFFECT

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:22.530
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND

01:33:22.596 --> 01:33:24.398
NOTHING'S BEEN DONE TO-

01:33:24.465 --> 01:33:27.268
PROTECT- THAT THEDATA IS BEING

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:29.103

AGENCY THAT I DON'T THINK A-

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:37.111
THAT TIME HEARD IN LISTED IN

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:38.679
THE BILL IS THE APPROPRIATE

01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:40.848
TIME BUT I TRUST THAT THAT THE

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:42.249
AUTHOR WILL WILL WORK WITH

01:33:42.316 --> 01:33:46.554
THEM. THANK YOU CYNICAL HERE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YOU TO

01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:50.858
SENATOR WIENER FOR BRINGING

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:52.360
THIS FORWARD I JUST HAD A

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:54.295
THOUGHT AND- I KNOW THAT THE

01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:56.464
AUDITOR HAD INCLUDED-

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:58.432
ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE I THINK-

01:33:58.499 --> 01:33:59.934
SHE HAD RECOMMENDED C. JUST

01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:02.169
COMPLIANCE WHICH MOST- LAW

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:03.804
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD HAVE

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.539
TO DO WITH. CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:34:05.606 --> 01:34:06.807
DATA BUT SINCE W'RE-

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:08.776
REINVENTING WHAT L. A. L. P. R.

01:34:08.843 --> 01:34:10.378
DATA WHERE THEY CAN WORK CAN

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:12.079
GO. MY CONCERN IS THAT THERE

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:13.714
ARE FEW AGENCIES NOW THAT ARE

01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:16.984
CURRENTLY- COMPLYING WITH

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:18.853
SIEGES. BUT THAT WOULD ASSUME

01:34:18.919 --> 01:34:20.621
COMPLIANCE WITH IN IN

01:34:20.688 --> 01:34:23.090
COLLABORATION WITH THE FBI. SO

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:25.760
THAT IS CONCERNING TO ME- AND

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.895
SO I'M JUST WONDERING. THIS IS

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:28.829
FOR A LATER DISCUSSION THOUGH

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:31.265
AS YOUR YOU KNOW INVOLVING THE

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.100
BILL IS. IF THIS DATA WOULD

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:35.970
STILL HAVE TO. UP IF IT WOULD

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:37.571
STILL COMPLY OR WOULD IT STILL

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:39.306
BE NECESSARY FOR IT TO COMPLY

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:41.042
WITH SIEGES THE CRIMINAL

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:42.176
JUSTICE INFORMATION SYSTEM.

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:46.380
DATA ARM WE WILL LET ME SEE IF

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:47.848
I COULD CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU ON

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:49.850
THAT I JUST CAN'T RECALL

01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:50.951
AFFECTS MANDATED UNDER FEDERAL

01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:53.788
LAW OR NOT- WE ACTUALLY DON'T

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.589
WANT THEM TO BE SHARING WITH

FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:34:56.757 --> 01:34:59.193
AGENCIES AT ALL- AND WE THINK

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.761
THAT ACTUALLY UNDER CURRENT

01:35:00.828 --> 01:35:01.829
CALIFORNIA LAW WE DON'T THINK

01:35:01.896 --> 01:35:04.565
THEY'RE ALLOWED. TO DO THAT

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:05.699
RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE MOST

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:08.302
FOCUS ON ICE- BUT WE'LL GO BACK

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:11.072

IT IS IT REALLY ABOUT PERK

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:34.889

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:54.975

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:57.211
AND CIRCLE OF THE TIMING OF

01:36:57.278 --> 01:36:59.480

WAS JUST HOPING TO DIG DEEPER

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:08.022
INTO THAT TENSION BETWEEN. THE

01:37:08.088 --> 01:37:10.658
BILLS- TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD

01:37:10.724 --> 01:37:12.193

01:37:12.259 --> 01:37:14.195
PROTOCOLS LIKE. WHAT ARE THE

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:17.531

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:26.073
TIME. NO I CAN ANSWER THAT NOW-

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.877
SO I MEAN I THINK OUR JOB THE

01:37:29.944 --> 01:37:30.878
REASON WHAT WITH THE TWENTY

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:32.446

THEN- OVER GOING TO KEEP

WORKING ON THAT IS THAT WE

01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:39.086

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:58.038
WHY ARE YOU KEEPING THAT DATA-

01:37:58.105 --> 01:37:59.340
