NUMBER IS VERY LIKELY UNDER

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:09.745

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:11.180
AND AT LEAST THIRTY FIVE

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:13.849

RESEARCH ON THOSE CROPS- FOR

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:48.711
EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW- ACCORDING.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.413
TO WHAT I ARE DOING RESEARCH ON.

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:53.049

CURRENT ONGOING ACCOUNTABILITY

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:42.364
MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:46.001
CAN IMPROVE THAT SYSTEM. NOT

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:49.104

THINK THAT URBAN FARMERS AS WE

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:02.183
TALKED ABOUT THAT WITH BOTH THE

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.752
U. S. THE ADVENTURES AND THEN

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:05.854
ALSO WITHIN CITY UPDATE

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.956
PROGRAMS AND POLICIES WE DON'T

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:10.458
REALLY HAVE AN URBAN AG FOCUS

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:13.728
AND- SOME SOME NEW- I'D

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.530

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:32.447
MEMBERS ON THAT COMMITTEE AND-

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:33.715
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:35.417
HEARING FROM DAM ABOUT HOW WE

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:39.954
CAN START TO CREATE. THOSE

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:40.922
PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES- I

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.190
THINK A LOT CAN DO IN THAT IN

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:44.926
THIS AREA AND I THINK THAT-

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.628
THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WILL

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.029
COME WITH IN THIS YEAR FROM

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:49.597
ACTUALLY LISTENING AND LETTING

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.566
THOSE URBAN FARMERS GUIDE-

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:54.302
THOSE PRIORITIES AND- REALLY

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:56.204
TRY TO CREATE SOME. PROGRAMS

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:58.306
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:01.810
THEM. AND THEN IT WIL START TO

01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:03.211
CREATE THAT TO WORK FOR THEM.

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:06.548
WHAT I. THERE ARE. GOING TO

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:08.216
TAKE. SHE KNOW I WOULD SAY ONE

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:10.118
PROGRAM THAT DOES THAT DOES

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:13.154
HAVE- AND- POTENTIAL INFLUENCE

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:14.956
AND IMPORTANCE WITH URBAN AG IS

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:17.158
OUR FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAM AND

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:18.693
THIS IS A NEW GRANT PROGRAM

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.130
THAT WAS JUST- ACTUALLY THE R.

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:23.765
F. P. WAS JUST RECENTLY

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.934
RELEASED- AND SO THERE IS THAT

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.902
PROGRAM BUT- THERE ARE MORE

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:29.704
OPPORTUNITIES I THINK THAT NEED

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:32.741
TO BE REALIZED WITH REGARDS TO

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:33.942
URBAN FARMERS. GOOD BECAUSE

01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:36.711
THERE THERE ARE SWATHS OF LAND.

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:38.880
WHERE IN SOUTH LA WHERE WE HAVE

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:41.983
A- OPTION ABANDONED INDUSTRY

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:44.986
AND WAREHOUSES- ARE JUST VACANT

01:23:45.053 --> 01:23:47.055
LOTS EVERYWHERE ALL OVER SOUTH

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:50.191
LA. THAT WOULD BE AMENABLE TO

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:51.893
SOME KIND OF URBAN FARMING

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.361
ENDED BUT WE'VE NEVER REALLY

01:23:53.428 --> 01:23:56.030
DEVELOPED AND- A ROBUST

01:23:56.097 --> 01:23:59.300
PLANNED- TO ADDRESS IT- AND YOU

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:01.369
KNOW SOMEONE. THAT BELIEVES

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:04.873
THAT. ONE DAY ONCE. CANNABIS

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:09.110
IS- LEGALIZED FEDERALLY- WE

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:11.379
DON'T NEED AS MUCH LAND TO MAKE

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:14.282
A GOOD PROFIT AND THE

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:15.049
AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY START TO

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:17.519
EMBRACE IT AND MAYBE EVEN TAKE

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.521
PARTS OF THEIR LAND TO HELP

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:21.856
WITH THE BOTTOM LINE- TWO BROKE

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:23.825
CANNABIS THAT MIGHT BE AN

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.127
EXCELLENT START IN ENDS IN

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:28.296
SOUTH LA AND OTHER PLACES AND

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:29.864
SO THAT WE CAN BUILD AN ECONOMY

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:32.267
THAT IS IN INDUSTRY AND SO-

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:34.669
RIGHT NOW THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.738
IS BECOMING PART OF THE LOS

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:38.339
ANGELES CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:39.707
OTHER CHAMBERS SO THEY'RE-

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:40.608
THEY'RE BECOMING PART OF THE

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:42.644
MAINSTREAM AND SO I THINK AS

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:45.079
NEW PRODUCTS COME UP. NOT JUST

01:24:45.146 --> 01:24:46.681
THE TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:47.582
WE THINK ABOUT THE NEW PRODUCTS

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.951
COME UP- AGRICULTURE SHOULD

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.753
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND THEN

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.255
INCORPORATE- LANCE THERE ARE

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:56.825
NOT TRADITIONALLY IN YOUR WHAT

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:58.660
YOU WOULD THINK YOU SHOULD DO

01:24:58.726 --> 01:24:59.961
THAT STINKS THERE ARE KIND OF

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:02.063
OUT OF THE BOX SO- I WOULD LOVE

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.998
TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:04.666
THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY

EVERYTHING ELSE LEARNING ABOUT

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.154
HOW GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WORK

OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:47.582

WORLD TOGETHER WITH MY HUSBAND

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:54.422
HIS FAMILY ALSO- WORK THERE.

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:58.459
AND IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND-

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:00.828
JUST INCREDIBLE JOURNEY BECAUSE

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:03.297
WHEN WE STARTED AND- WE FELT

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:04.799
THAT WE KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:06.333
FARMING YOU KNOW TO START OUR

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.601
OWN BUSINESS BUT QUICKLY

01:35:07.668 --> 01:35:11.272
LEARNED THAT THERE WAS- A LOT

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:11.906
OF IT THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:14.275
IN MAINLY- A LOT OF THINGS ARE

01:35:14.341 --> 01:35:16.243
BEING TALKED ABOUT LIKE-

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:18.779
APPLYING- FOR DIFFERENT PERMITS

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:21.015
AND JUST FOLLOWING REGULATIONS

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:22.450
AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE. VERY

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.852
PICKERS WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:27.088
OF THAT AND SO QUICKLY WE WERE

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:28.489
FACED WITH A LOT OF CHALLENGES

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:29.790
AND THE FIRST ONE WAS YOU KNOW

01:35:29.857 --> 01:35:31.225
WHEN LOOKING FOR LAND YOU KNOW

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:32.760
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:35.196
DIFFICULT IT IS YOU KNOW FOR A

01:35:35.262 --> 01:35:36.730
SMALL FARMER STARTING UP TO THE

01:35:36.797 --> 01:35:38.666
ACCORDING TO LAND. AND MOST-

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:40.835
PEOPLE WHO WERE LEASING LAND

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:42.903
ONE AND- REFERENCES WE DID A

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:44.738
CREDIT CHECK AND WE HAD NOTHING

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:46.440
SO IT TOOK US YOU KNOW MONTHS

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:48.909
UNTIL WE WERE ABLE TO. FIND

01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:50.277
SOMEONE THAT WOULD JUST TAKE

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:52.713
OUR WORD AND TRUST US YOU KNOW

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.715
TO YOU KNOW PAY THEM THE RENT

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:56.684
SO WE STARTED WITH THREE ACRES.

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.352
AND THEN SHORTLY AFTER- THE

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:01.755
OTHER CHALLENGE WAS EQUIPMENT-%

01:36:01.822 --> 01:36:06.293
MOST. OF US NEED A LOT OF YOU

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.495
KNOW DE FOR TOOLS LIKE. AND

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:08.095
AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS CHANNEL.

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:10.297
WERE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM-

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:11.665
WHEN YOU GO TO THESE PLACES

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:13.667
THAT RENT EQUIPMENT TO THIS DAY

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:15.436
THEY HAVE LONG APPLICATIONS.

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:16.837
AND HALF OF IT YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:19.306
NOT ABLE TO- COMPLETE BECAUSE

01:36:19.373 --> 01:36:21.742
WE DON'T HAVE REFERENCES AGAIN

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:24.178
YOU KNOW CREDIT. SO FOR MANY

01:36:24.245 --> 01:36:26.313
YEARS- WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.315
JUST BE RESOURCEFUL AND GO OUT

01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:30.484
TO OTHER FARMERS AND WE KNOW

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:32.786
OUR COMMUNITY AND ASKED TO

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.622
BORROW OR RENT FROM THEM AND

01:36:34.688 --> 01:36:36.290
THAT'S HOW WE MADE IT WORK.

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:39.760
UNTIL WE WERE SLOWLY- YOU KNOW

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:42.163
SAVING MONEY AND ACQUIRED OUR

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:44.265
OWN EQUIPMENT. SO I AND YOU

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:46.100
KNOW WHEN I THINK BACK- A LOT

01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:47.902
OF WHAT I'VE LISTENED TO JUST

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:50.538

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:52.907
WENT THROUGH WHERE. MY LOT OF

THESE PLACES AND RESOURCES WE

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:57.444

01:37:18.432 --> 01:37:19.600

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:38.886
OF- TRANSITIONING TO ORGANIC.

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:40.487

DEVELOP AN INFRASTRUCTURE- AND

01:48:42.315 --> 01:48:43.483
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING

01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:44.851
THAT WITH CONTRA COSTA COUNTY

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:46.119
WHO REALLY SUPPORTS OUR

01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:47.554
PROJECT. IS REALLY EXCITED

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:49.556
ABOUT IT EXCEPT FOR THE NEW

01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:55.962
SURPLUS LAND ACT. IT IS

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:57.397
ACTUALLY BLOCKING THE SALE OF

01:48:57.464 --> 01:48:59.466
THE PROPERTY TO US- BECAUSE IT

01:48:59.532 --> 01:49:01.268
HAS TO FIRST BE OFFERED TO LOW

01:49:01.334 --> 01:49:04.271
INCOME HOUSING. AND YOU KNOW

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:06.239
I'D REALLY LOVE TO SEE AN

01:49:06.306 --> 01:49:08.141
EXEMPTION IN THE SURPLUS LAND

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:11.244
ACT THAT ALLOWS FOR PROJECTS

01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:12.846
LIKE OURS THAT ARE WORKING

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:15.015
TOWARDS IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:18.318
BY USING SURPLUS. PUBLIC LAND

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:21.221
FOR GROWING- I THINK THAT THAT

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:23.056
WOULD BE A HUGE HELP I MEAN

01:49:23.123 --> 01:49:24.624
ESPECIALLY AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF

01:49:24.691 --> 01:49:26.059
WORKING ON THIS PROJECT TO BE

01:49:26.126 --> 01:49:27.861
AMENDED THE GENERAL PLAN WE

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:29.129
NEGOTIATED A THIRTY YEAR LEASE

01:49:29.195 --> 01:49:31.064
WE BY RESTORING THE SOIL WE

01:49:31.131 --> 01:49:32.632
BUILT TEMPORARY INFRASTRUCTURE

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:34.100
WE CREATED A LONG TERM BUILDING

01:49:34.167 --> 01:49:36.503
PLANET CAPITAL CAMPAIGN. AND

01:49:36.569 --> 01:49:37.971
PASSED THE WHOLE SEQUEL PROCESS

01:49:38.038 --> 01:49:41.174
WHICH WAS CRAZY DIFFICULT AND

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:43.476
NOW IS IN DANGER OF LOSING THE

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:46.947
WHOLE- THE WHOLE PROJECT. YOU

01:49:47.013 --> 01:49:48.448
KNOW TOWARDS A GOOD ENDS

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:49.616
BECAUSE WE WANT TO SUPPORT LOW

01:49:49.683 --> 01:49:51.017
INCOME HOUSING BUT I THINK THAT

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:52.519
THIS IS ALSO A NEED THAT OUR

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:54.854
COMMUNITY HOUSE. I ALSO WANT TO

01:49:54.921 --> 01:49:57.424
SPEAK REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE

01:49:57.490 --> 01:49:58.625
AGRICULTURE INCENTIVE ZONES

01:49:58.692 --> 01:50:00.126
THAT THAT FOLKS TALKED ABOUT

01:50:00.193 --> 01:50:02.495
EARLIER THE URBAN AG- KIND OF

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:05.832
TAX INCENTIVE. SO THAT WAS

01:50:05.899 --> 01:50:07.267
REALLY CELEBRATE IT WHEN IT

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:09.436
FIRST HAPPENS. EXCEPT WHEN WE

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:10.937
LOOK AT THE DETAILS REALIZE

01:50:11.004 --> 01:50:12.072
THAT PLACES LIKE RICHMOND

01:50:12.138 --> 01:50:13.506
DIDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:50:13.573 --> 01:50:15.608
A POPULATION OF A HUNDRED AND

01:50:15.675 --> 01:50:16.443
TEN THOUSAND INSTEAD OF TWO

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:18.078
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. SO

01:50:18.144 --> 01:50:20.880
ALTHOUGH OUR- CITY GOVERNMENT

01:50:20.947 --> 01:50:23.516
WANTED TO GET INVOLVED WE

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:25.085
ACTUALLY DID A QUALIFIED WOMAN

01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:31.891
ONCE AGAIN I'M SORRY MY DOG.

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:33.126
ISRAEL DURING COVERED YOU'RE

01:50:33.193 --> 01:50:38.565
GOOD. AND AND SO I JUST WANTED

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:40.400
TO BRING THAT UP AND SAY THAT

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:42.302
IF THAT IF THAT DIDN'T HAVE

01:50:42.369 --> 01:50:44.904
THAT THE THAT SCALE OF CITY WAS

01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:46.673
THE ONLY TYPE OF CITY WHO THAT

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:49.309
COULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT ACT.

01:50:49.376 --> 01:50:51.144
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT MORE CITIES

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:53.279
WOULD UTILIZE IT- BECAUSE THAT

01:50:53.346 --> 01:50:54.981
IS REALLY A BARRIER RICHMAN IS

01:50:55.048 --> 01:50:56.716
ACTUALLY REALLY RICH IN VACANT

01:50:56.783 --> 01:50:58.752
LOTS AND WE HAVE LOTS OF FOOD

01:50:58.818 --> 01:51:00.453
INSECURITY AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.855
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE

01:51:01.921 --> 01:51:03.923
INVOLVED IN URBAN AGRICULTURE

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:05.959
SO WE COULD MAKE THE MAGIC CARE

01:51:06.026 --> 01:51:07.861
BUT THERE'S LIMITATIONS TO WITH

01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:09.195
THE WITH THAT ACT IS WRITTEN.

01:51:09.262 --> 01:51:10.497
AND I JUST KIND OF PUT FORWARD

01:51:10.563 --> 01:51:12.432
AGAIN THE SURPLUS LAND ACT JUST

01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:13.867
AN EXEMPTION FOR FOOD SECURITY

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:16.002
PROJECT IS A GOOD USE OF

01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:19.205
SURPLUS- PUBLIC LANDS AND THEN

01:51:19.272 --> 01:51:20.306
JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:51:20.373 --> 01:51:21.808
GRANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:23.143
CURRENTLY OFFERED BY THE STATE

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:25.512
OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TRIED TO

01:51:25.578 --> 01:51:27.213
ACCESS QUIPPED AND HEALTHY

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.916
SOILS- BUT BOTH ARE NOT SUITED

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:31.885
AT ALL FOR URBAN AGRICULTURE

01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:33.787
EQUIPPED ESPECIALLY IS RELEASED

01:51:33.853 --> 01:51:35.055
IS REALLY BACK TO SUPPORT

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:36.623
LARGER FARMS IT'S BASED ON

01:51:36.689 --> 01:51:38.725
SCALE STEP YOU'RE GROWING AT A

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:40.760
VERY SMALL SCALE IT DOESN'T

01:51:40.827 --> 01:51:42.395
MAKE SENSE THE AMOUNT OF

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:47.167
SUPPORT YOU GET. IS BASED ON

01:51:47.233 --> 01:51:48.268
YOUR ACREAGE. SENATE THE M. OF

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:50.303
NEED WHAT YOUR TO DO- IT IS NOT

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:52.005
WORTH ALL OF THE PAPERWORK AND

01:51:52.072 --> 01:51:53.840
ALL OF THE THINGS FOR A VERY

01:51:53.907 --> 01:51:55.809
VERY SMALL SUPPORT THAT DOESN'T

01:51:55.875 --> 01:51:57.911
ACTUALLY MEET YOUR NEEDS- IN

01:51:57.977 --> 01:51:59.012
TERMS OF THE HEALTH DISORDERS

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:01.648
PROGRAM. AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT

01:52:01.714 --> 01:52:04.617
ONLY REALLY SUPPORTS- FOLKS

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:06.352
THAT ARE STARTING NEW HEALTHY

01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:08.555
SOIL PROJECT. PRACTICES SO WE

01:52:08.621 --> 01:52:11.491
ALREADY ARE USING COVER

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:14.661
CROPPING AND- YOU KNOW DRIP

01:52:14.727 --> 01:52:17.697
IRRIGATION AND KIND OF ALL THE

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:19.699
PRACTICE OF YOUR ORGANIC FARM-

01:52:19.766 --> 01:52:21.534
FARMING OPERATION SO WE CAN'T

01:52:21.601 --> 01:52:23.336
ACTUALLY ACCESS HEALTHY SOILS

01:52:23.403 --> 01:52:25.171
EITHER. BECAUSE NOTHING WOULD

01:52:25.238 --> 01:52:26.506
BE NEW WE'RE WE'RE ALREADY

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:27.841
DOING ALL THESE THINGS WE JUST

01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:29.809
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO

01:52:29.876 --> 01:52:32.412
THEM THE WAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE

01:52:32.479 --> 01:52:35.081
TO AN AT SCALE- AND FINALLY

01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:37.083
WHEN I WANTED TO PUT FORTH AN

01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:39.452
IDEA AND THAT IS. OUR VEGGIE

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:41.888
ARE EX PROGRAM IS REALLY

01:52:41.955 --> 01:52:44.324
PHENOMENAL- TRYING TO ACTUALLY

01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:47.594
WORK- TO PREVENT. ANY DISEASE

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:48.928
THAT MAKES OUR POPULATION

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:50.630
REALLY VULNERABLE TO THINGS

01:52:50.697 --> 01:52:52.532
LIKE KOBE OR JUST. YOU KNOW A

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:54.767
LIFETIME ARE OLD AT THE END OF

01:52:54.834 --> 01:52:57.103
LIFE BEING REALLY- JUST

01:52:57.170 --> 01:53:00.039
DISASTROUS AND REALLY IMPACTFUL

01:53:00.106 --> 01:53:01.908
FOR OUR HEALTH- SYSTEM WHICH IS

01:53:01.975 --> 01:53:03.510
QUITE POOR WE LOST OUR LOCAL

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:06.579
HOSPITAL. A FEW YEARS BACK. AND

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:07.947
I'D REALLY LIKE TO PUT FORWARD

01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:11.017
THE IDEA THAT. YOU KNOW FOOD

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:12.986
CAN BE AND SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF

01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:14.954
AS PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE. AND

01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:17.790
IF IT COULD BE INCLUDED IN

01:53:17.857 --> 01:53:19.526
COUNTY AND STATE HEALTH PLANS

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:21.494
SO THAT A PRESCRIPTION FOR

01:53:21.561 --> 01:53:23.363
HARDLY BOX OF FOOD FOR VERY LOW

01:53:23.429 --> 01:53:25.131
INCOME FAMILY THAT WOULDN'T

NORMALLY BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT-

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:28.635
THAT ACTUALLY COULD BE

01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:30.870
REVOLUTIONARY- BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:53:30.937 --> 01:53:32.338
THAT AS AN ACCEPTABLE THING TO

01:53:32.405 --> 01:53:33.640
INCLUDE IN THE HEALTH AND

01:53:33.706 --> 01:53:36.910
COVERAGE- BIKE MEDICINES. OR IN

01:53:36.976 --> 01:53:38.545
SOME CASES SOME FOLKS YOU KNOW

01:53:38.611 --> 01:53:40.847
CAN USE THEIR HEALTH PLAN TO GO

01:53:40.914 --> 01:53:44.050
TO THE GYM OR WHATEVER- A BOX

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:46.553
OF. HEALTHY WHOLE NUTRIENT

01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:48.821
DENSE FOOD EVERY WEEK COULD BE

01:53:48.888 --> 01:53:49.856
A REALLY GOOD THING AND THAT

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:51.858

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.829
OUR EXPOSURE TO PREMATURE DEATH.

ALREADY BEEN TRYING TO WORK ON

02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:36.876
THIS- BECAUSE EXISTING

INFRASTRUCTURE TAKES RESOURCES

02:03:38.878 --> 02:03:42.715
OUT OF NATIVE. COMMUNITIES BUT
