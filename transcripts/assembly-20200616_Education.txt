THE- LET US PROCEED WELCOME TO THIS HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE. ON THE RE OPENING OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THE 202-021-2020 TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR. I AM CALLING- THIS HEARING TO ORDER. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE MEMBER CENTER LEYVA- COLLEAGUES FROM THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC TO THIS HEARING ON A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC- TO OUR CHILDREN TO THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE TO OUR ECONOMY TO PARENTS. TO JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC IMPORTANT MAY I HAVE TWO KIDS IN SCHOOL AND- I OFTEN SEVEN THE FALLEN. SO THIS THIS THIS IS- THESE DYNAMICS ARE INTERESTING AND CHALLENGING BOTH THE SAME TIME. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT SCHOOL WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE FALL UNDER THE UNPRECEDENTED CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THE CODE NINETEEN. EPIDEMIC. WE WILL HEAR ABOUT THE MEASURE SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO TAKE TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS AND STAFF. WE'LL HEAR ABOUT WHAT TEACHING. AND LEARNING WILL LOOK LIKE OR MIGHT LOOK LIKE BECAUSE THINGS ARE VERY FLUID AND MAY CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AND WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THE SUPPORT SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO PROVIDE TO STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THIS MOST UNIQUE TIME IRAQ CANNOT HIGHLIGHT ENOUGH THAT THE SITUATION IS FLUID. AND MAY CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WE MAY HAVE KIDS AT SCHOOL ONE MONTH KIDS AT HOME ANOTHER MONTH KID SPLITTING TIME. ANOTHER MONTH WE JUST DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT SO BE PREPARED FOR FLUID YOUR FOR SURE. BUT LET'S START BY BEING REAL AGAIN THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY WE ARE IN UNCHARTERED TERRITORY. WITH MORE UNCERTAINTY AHEAD. WHEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT. AND CHALLENGING TASK. AND AGAIN IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT HAPPENS A MODOC COUNTY WAY UP NORTH MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAPPENS AND LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN FACT ON ANY ONE DAY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL HAVE A MILLION PEOPLE ON THEIR SCHOOL SITES SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO THE CHILDREN ATTENDING THE STAFF THERE AND THEN ONCE THEY LEAVE THE BORDERS OF THAT. THAT SCHOOL SITE WELL THE ALL THE INTERACTION THEY'RE GOING TO INCUR AS FAR ASTRACING EXCEPT ROOM. BUT THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AND WE MUST BE FORWARD AND DO OUR BEST MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES DEPEND ON OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN SAFE. LEARNING AND GROWING AND THAT IS OUR CHIEF MISSION. THE JOB OF SCHOOLS NEXT YEAR WILL TO BE STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. AND PROVIDING EDUCATION THE TO THE KEY TO OUR TO OUR CHILDREN. TO ACHIEVE THAT BALANCE SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO USE A VARIETY OF MODELS TO KEEP STUDENTS AND STAFF PHYSICALLY DISTANT. MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PLANNING HYBRID MODELS WAS STUDENTS ATTENDING SOME DAYS IN PERSON AND OTHER DAYS USING THE DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL. FOR EXAMPLE SOME SCHOOLS WILL OFFER A MONDAY WEDNESDAY TUESDAY THURS OR MONDAY WEDNESDAY AND THEN A TUESDAY THURSDAY SCHEDULE- FOR GROUPS OF STUDENTS OF DIFFERENT GRADES. OTHERS MAY ESTABLISH A WEEK ON WEEK OFF SCHEDULE OR STAGGERED HALF DAY SCHEDULES WE JUST DON'T KNOW BUT AGAIN IT. SHOULD REALLY BE UP TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FOLLOWING- APPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS TO DESIGN WHAT BEST MEETS THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. WE SHOULDN'T. DR WHAT EVERY SCHOOLS RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS SHOULD BE WE SHOULD JUST SET PARAMETERS NOT SCHOOLS BE CREATIVE. THE OTHERS AGAIN MAYBE WE DON'T KNOW A MINUTE SOME SCHOOLS MAKE ONLINE FOR A WEEK OFF LINE FOR WEEKS I MAY GO ONLINE SOME STUDENTS MAY BE ONLINE SOME STUDENTS MAY NOT BE ONLINE- I WOULD ENCOURAGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE READY TO PROVIDE ONLINE LEARNING A CONTINUE THAT APPROACH. BECAUSE THEY MAY WELL NEEDED SOME SCHOOLS SOME STUDENTS MAY BE VERY VULNERABLE ANDNEED TO REMAIN ONLINE WHILE OTHERS CAN COULD IN IT CAN ATTEND SCHOOL EVERY DAY AGAIN WE JUST DON'T KNOW. SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO WORK WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF OPINION AMONG PARENTS ABOUT WHAT SCHOOL SHOULD LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR. I GOT A CALL FOR ONE LAST NIGHT. ONLINE LEARNING AGAIN WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE IN SOME FORM FOR ALL STUDENTS. BUT AGAIN CERTAIN GROUPS STUDENTS BROUGHT GONNA HAVE TO GO TO USE THE ONLINE. MODEL BECAUSE THEY AGAIN HER FROM VULNERABLE GROUPS MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HEARING FROM SOME PARENTS THAT THEY DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL SO AGAIN THAT ONLINE LEARNING APPROACH MAY BE BEST FOR THEM. SCHOOLS WILL NEED YOUR HAIR TO THE NEW SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR MASS. DID TO DISINFECTING TO TEMPERATURE CHECKS AND CRITICALLY THEY WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP KIDS LEARNING. UNDER ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND AGAIN WHAT HAPPENS IN VERY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT WHAT HAPPENS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF OUR- ESPECIALLY ALMOST AS STUDENTS STRUGGLED WITH DISTANCE LEARNING THIS SPRING AND WILL ARRIVE AT SCHOOL. WAS SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC DEFICITS. IT APPEARS THAT MANY STUDENTS WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE WITH AT LEAST PARTIAL DISTANCE LEARNING NEXT YEAR. AND THEIR FEARS THAT THESE STUDENTS. MAY HAVE LEARNING DEFICITS DEFICITS THAT CONTINUE. THAT COMPOUND. THERE ARE MANY ISSUES FOR SCHOOLS TO GRAPPLE WITH. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY OUR QUESTION TODAY IS. HOW CAN SCHOOLS KEEP STUDENTS HEALTHY. LOOK THAT KEEP STUDENTS HEALTHY LEARNING ENGAGE AND SUPPORTED WHEN OUR SYSTEM IS IN FLUX. MANY OF OUR FAMILIES ARE IN CRISIS AND ARE FISCAL OUTLOOK IS GRIM. OUR JOB AS I SEE IT IS REALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT YES IT KNOWLEDGE AT THIS IS A STORM BUT IS OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE IT IS NOT THE PERFECT STORM. BY CONTROLLING OR ALTERING AS MANY VARIABLES AS WE CAN. THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSION AND I WOULD OFF OR- SENATOR LEYVA MY COUNTERPART ON THE SENATE SIDE SHE WANTED TO. SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UP FIRST THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAHLE FOR INVITING THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. CD STAFF AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN THIS DIFFICULT. BUT THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO HELP PRODUCE THE GUIDANCE THAT WILL SURELY BE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO GIVE A HUGE THANKS TO OUR TEACHERS STUDENTS AND PARENTS. FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE EFFORT AND FLEXIBILITY SINCE IS UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS BEGAN. AS A YEAR STARTED THAN OF US WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WE HEAR TODAY. BUT HERE WE ARE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE EVERYONE'S HARD WORK. IN MANY WAYS THE REAL WORK IS JST BEGINNING AS WE STRIVE TO OPEN OUR SCHOOLS AND THE SAFEST WAY POSSIBLE. IT NEED FOR ELLIE A TO. THEIR THROUGH THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR IS OVER I'M SURE THEY'RE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT. AND NOW AS MANY OF ALREADY BEEN DOING FOR SOMETIME ELOISE MUST THOUGHTFULLY AND CREATIVELY PLAN FOR THE NEW REALITY WE FACE GOING INTO THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR. IT IS CLEAR CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS WILL LOOK AND FEEL DIFFERENT. SCHEDULES WILL LIKELY BE DIFFERENT FOR MANY AND THE BARRIERS TO STUDENTS OF COLOR FACE. WILL BE WORSENED WITHOUT ACTION BUT THROUGH PARTNERSHIP CAREFUL PLANNING AND PRACTICING AND A LITTLE PATIENCE. I'M CONFIDENT THE ELLIE IS CAN PROVIDE ESSENTIAL STANDARDS BASED EDUCATION TO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IN A SAFE AND HEALTHY MANNER. IT HAPPENED SAID BEFORE. THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY. IT WOULD BE A- TO TRY TO RECREATE EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD BEFORE COVERT NINETEEN. BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS NOT PERFECT. IT USES CHALLENGING UP. THINK ABOUT HOW WE PROVIDE EDUCATE. BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECTS OF COVERT NINETEEN BUT JUST AS CRITICALLY IN THE LONG TERM TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL THE STRUCTURE THAT COVERT. DISRUPTED WORKED EQUITABLY SO AS WE CONTINUE TO CAREFULLY PLAN FOR WHAT COMES NEXT LET'S ALSO PLAN TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT PLANS FOR EQUITY AND ENSURES ACCESS OF A QUALITY EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS.

WITH THAT SAID LET'S START WITH OUR FIRST SPEAKER AND THEN THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. TONY THURMOND WHO'S JOINING US BY REMOTE VIDEO FROM THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- SUPERINTENDENT JANET THURMAN YOU HAS AN INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. ABOUT THREE OR. THANK YOU CHAIR THE- THANK YOU CHAIR LEYVA TONY THURMOND STAY SUPER UP AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IF I WAS GOING TO GIVE MY REMARKS THE TITLE THE TITLE WOULD BE NO EASY CHOICES LIKE MANY OF YOU I'VE WORKED IN SCHOOLS FOR MANY YEARS FOR ONE CAN ASKING. OUR STUDENTS TO COME BACK TO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY HAVE TO BE SPACED OUT WITH SIX FEET OF DISTANCE AND WEARING A FACIAL COVERING. YOU WE KNOW THAT FALLS UNDER THE BANNER OF NO EASY CHOICES. BUT THE PANDEMIC. DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THOSE THAT MIGHT BE IMPACTED AND THIS IS THE MOST SERIOUS OF MATTERS AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT IT PROVIDES NO EASY CHOICES. THERE ARE THREE THAT WE TO DO TO IT HERE TO ENSURE A SAFE AND THAT'S WHAT. OUR GUIDANCE SPEAKS TO I WANT TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE RESILIENCY OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STATE. AND THEIR PARENTS AND OUR EDUCATORS. THEY LITERALLY MOVED INTO DISTANCE LEARNING OVERNIGHT. WITH NO INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO DO THAT AND WHILE THERE ARE BUMPS I WANTED KNOWLEDGE YOUR RESILIENCY IN THE MANNER IN WHICH OUR STUDENTS AND OUR EDUCATORS AND OUR FAMILY MEMBERS. HAVE WORKED HARD TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE AND LEARNING- THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. THIS PANDEMIC IS VERY DANGEROUS- IT IS CLICK ALREADY CHRONICLED UNDOCUMENTED THE NUMBER OF LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST. I JUST WANT TO ADD EMPHASIS TO WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW. THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS IN PEOPLE WITH UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS FACE A HIGHER RISK OF INFECTION. AND WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR STUDENTS. FOR THOSE REASONS BECAUSE OF THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE GUIDANCE THAT WE PROVIDED. PROVIDES THE STRONGEST RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS AND OUR EDUCATORS SAFE. WHILE THEY'RE SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS. THEY'RE ASKING ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF TO WEAR A FACIAL COVERING. RASKIN THAT DEATH WILL BE SPACED OUT SIX FEET APART. AND THAT EVEN ON BUSES SIX FEET A SPACING IS WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING. WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE DIFFICULT RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPLEMENT. AND SO WE'RE HAVING THOSE SAME CONVERSATIONS. WITH MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DIFFERENT PARTNERS ABOUT HOW THESE WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HARD BUT AGAIN WERE PROVIDED WITH NO EASY CHOICES AS SENATOR LEYVA POINTED OUT THIS PANDEMIC HAS TAUGHT US A VERY EMBARRASSING. SECRET ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS. THAT IN IN IN A STATE THAT HAS THEMOST ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. MORE THAN A MILLION STUDENTS IN OUR STATE. WENT WITHOUT THE INTERNET BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR DECADES. WE'VE GOT TO RESPOND TO THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND DO SO IN A WAY THAT HELPS US TO OLD MOVIE CLOSE AT DIVIDE NO DEVICE. BITES OF CAN REPLACE WHAT A GREAT TEACHER DOES. BUT A DEVICE IS A TOOL TO KEEP AN EDUCATOR IN THEIR STUDENTS CONNECTED AND IT HELPS IN THE PROCESS. WE KNOW THAT DURING DISTANCE LEARNING OUR STUDENTS EXPERIENCE DEPRESSION. IT'S JUST. IN WE THAT IN THE LAST SEASON WEEKS OUR STUDENTS ARE. EGGS OF. DIFFICULT AND HARD TO WATCH POLICE BRUTALITY THAT PLAYED OUT IN TERMS OF RACE. AND BIAS. WE KNOW THAT. THIS IS WHAT OUR STUDENTS WILL BE COMING BACK TO SCHOOL WEARING A FACIAL COVERING. AND DEALING WITH THE TRAUMA THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THEIR WORLD AGAIN. NO EASY CHOICES. BUT THIS IS AN EQUITY ISSUE AS THE CHAIR HASPOINTED OUT. MANY OF OUR STUDENTS LIVE IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH THEIR PARENTS HAVE TO WORK. AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE IT THEY MUST GO BACK TO WORK. AND SO WE MUST CREATE SAFETY FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS A SPECIAL. SINCE FROM OF HOUSEHOLDS IN ROLE TO. AND STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO MAY NOT A CHOICE. BUT TO RETURN WE DO KNOW THAT SOME FAMILIES WILL FOCUS ON DISTANCE LEARNING. BUT WE KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SURVEYED HAVE INDICATED THE NEED FOR. CLASS INSTRUCTION AND SO RIGHT IT'S PROVIDES REPUTATION. ABOVE THAT HAD A THAT SAFELY. I DON'T IS BASED ON SOME. WE'VE ALWAYS HAD IFSCHOOL BE OPEN IT'S GOT TO BE. ON IT SCIENCE. WHAT WE KNOW. KNOW WHAT WE KNOW COMES FROM THE CDT. AND SEE P. H. HELLO. AND IT WARMED AND ARE COUNTY OFFICERS AND IT. WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS LITERALLY HELP IN THE MEASURE. SQUARE FOOTAGE TO DETERMINE HOW MANY STUDENTS THEY CAN SERVE IN THEIR CLASSES. AND WHAT THEY'RE OVER. MORE THAN THIRTY WEBINARS SINCE MARCH THIRTEENTH TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING HOW TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES HOW TO SUPPORT OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IMMEDIATELY GET ACCESS TO A COMPUTER ANOTHER HUNDRED THOUSAND GET ACCESS TO A HOT SPOT. MANY STUDENTS WITH A TASK FORCE AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THE CHAIRPERSON SHIP WITH SENATOR LEYVA. HAD BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE FREE INTERNET REDUCE COSTS INTERNET BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY STUDENTS WHO STILL CANNOT ACCESS IT. DUE TO INFRASTRUCTURE BARRIERS THAT EXIST IN OUR STATE AND SO WE'RE LOOKING TO OUR STATE LEADERS AND TO OUR FEDERAL LEADERS TO PROVIDE US WITH THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE. THESE BARRIERS. GRATEFUL TO THE WORK OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHERS TO ENSURE THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE A STARTING AMOUNT OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. FACIAL COVER. SHIELDS HANDS. AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. TO HELP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN WITH PP. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COUNSELING GROUPS ON HADDOCK HELP CLOSE THE GAPS. THAT MANY HAVE EXPERIENCE AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO ADDRESS TRAUMA. WE INVITE YOU TO TUNE IN ON THURSDAY WHEN WE HOLD A VIRTUAL SUPPORT CIRCLE FOR OUR STUDENTS. TO TALK ABOUT TRAUMA AND THE TRUMP OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT WITNESSED POLICE TALLY AND ACTS OF RACISM. THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE ASKING CHALCIS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. WAS PROVIDE FOR THE MOTION NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS WE PUT IT IN THESE CONTEXTS WE MUST ADDRESS THEIR SAFETY. YOU MUST ADDRESS THE EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF OUR- WE- AT GAPS. I HAVE EXIST WE KNOW THAT. WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING AS TEACHERS WITH HAVE ALWAYS DONE.

WE'RE STRONGER TOGETHER AND TOGETHER WE CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION WHICH IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WILL FACE IN OUR LIFETIME AND THAT'S HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS A SIX MILLION STUDENTS IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE AT THIS TIME. I THANK YOU MISTER THURMAN- LET'S MOVE TO OUR FIRST PANEL WHICH WE ADDRESSING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF STUDENTS AND STAFF AND A REMINDER THAT WOULD BE HOLDING QUESTIONS.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING ALL THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF THE STATE WIDE OPEN NINETEEN FUND EMIC RESPONSE BY STAYING HOME IN FOLLOWING THE EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES THAT WE HAVE PROVIDE. AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA MANAGED TO KEEP THE NUMBER OF COLVIN NINETEEN CASES AND DEATHS FAR BELOW. THE NUMBER. THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE HAD. AS AN EXAMPLE WELL CALIFORNIA HAS NEARLY 15% OF THE US POPULATION. WE HAVE HAD LESS THAN 5% OF THE DEATHS NATIONWIDE. ADDITIONALLY WE WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN FLATTENING THE CURVE. HOWEVER LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THAT THE PANDEMIC IS FAR FROM OVER AND WE CANNOT LET OUR GUARD DOWN. THERE IS A LOT ABOUT THIS VIRUS THAT WE DO NOT KNOW IF WE MUST BE VIGILANT AND PROTECT OURSELVES AND PROTECT EACH OTHER. I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THIS SCHOOL AND SCHOOL BASED GUIDANCE THAT THAT THE BARMAN RELEASE WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE. OF JUNE TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY. THESE A GUIDANCE SEEKS TO ASSIST LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE THEY CREATE PLANS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS. AND PREPARED TO RESUME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THROUGH THE LENS OF PROTECT THE SAFETY. ALSO THROUGH THEN WERE THE SAFETY OF STOP AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE ARE THIS INNER. THE SILENCE CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON THE AVAILABLE PUBLIC DATA AT THIS. YOU AND NATIONAL BEST PRACTICES SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND THE PRACTICAL REALITIES OF MANAGING SCHOOL OPERATIONS. AS NEW DATA IN PRACTICE TO MERGE THE GUIDANCE WILL BE UPDATED. IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE GUIDELINES WILL DEPEND ON LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. COMMUNITIES MEETING FREE AGREED UPON CRITERIA SUCH AS LOWER INCIDENCE OF COMMON NINETEEN CASES. STABLE HOSPITALIZATION RATES THAN ADEQUATE PREPAREDNESS MAY IMPLEMENTED THE GUIDANCE DESCRIBED BELOW AS PART OF A FACED RE OPENING. AS A GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS STATED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS LOCALISM IS THE TERMINATE THE- INDICATING THAT THE ACTUAL COVER NINETEEN RESPONSE DECISIONS ARE TO BE MADE LOCALLY. THEREFORE ALL DECISIONS ABOUT FOLLOWING THESE GUIDELINES SHOULD BE MADE IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS AND OTHER AUTHORITIES. IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE GUIDELINES SHOULD BE TAILORED FOR EACH SETTING INCLUDING ADEQUATE CONSIDERATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS OPERATING AT EACH SCHOOL SITE. AND THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. SCHOOL LEADERS SHOOTING GATE TO RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING FAMILIES STAFF A LABEL PARTNERS IN THIS GOAL COMMUNITY TO FORMULATE AND IMPLEMENT PLANS. GENERALLY THE GUIDELINES EMPHASIZE PREVENTION MEASURES WHILE OFFERING SCHOOLS SOME FLEXIBILITY TO APPROPRIATELY MEDICAID BASED. BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY HAPPEN NAVIGATE. THIS INCLUDES AN EMPHASIS ON PROMOTING HEALTHY HI TO PRACTICE THIS. BUILDING THOSE PRACTICES INTO THE SCHOOL DAY AND INTENSIFYING CLEANING THIS INFECTION AND VENTILATION. THE GUIDANCE DISCUSSES IMPLEMENTING THIS NOTHING INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. EMPHASIZING PRACTICES THAT MINIMIZE CONTACT A SHARING OF RESOURCES AND EQUIPMENT AND PROMOTE THE USE OF NON CLASSROOMS BASIS TO MAXIMIZE SPACE WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THE GUIDANCE ALSO DISCUSSES TRAINING OF ALL STAFF INACTIVE INFREQUENT SCREENING FOR SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL CASES. IN CREATING PLANS TO ISOLATE INDIVIDUALS HO MAY BE COME SYMPTOMATIC. ADDITIONALLY THE GUIDANCE ADDRESSES THIS YEAR COMES DOWN SAYS UNDER WHICH SCHOOLS MAY HAVE TO CLOSE SHOULD THERE BE A RISING CASE THIS THING THE SCHOOL POPULATION WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER FOR GUIDANCE AND CONSULTATION. FINALLY I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT OUR GUIDANCE PROVIDES A GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR SAFE RE OPENING AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REGION MANDATE OR SET OF REQUIREMENTS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK YOU DOCTOR CHAVEZ WILL NOW TURN BACK TO- SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN OF AGAIN FROM LOS ANGELES. BABY THERE AND NUMBER EIGHTY. WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE COPIES OF THE GUIDANCE TO ANYONE WHO WISHES TO HAVE A COPY OF IT- WE ALSO IN THE GUIDANCE HAVE A NUMBER OF APPENDICES AND SUMMARIES AND A HEALTH AND SAFETY CHECK LIST THAT POINTS TO MANY OF THE KEY AREAS THAT WE THINK ARE ESSENTIAL. TO PROVIDING SAFETY FOR OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF I LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE- ON THE PANEL TODAY YOU'LL HEAR FROM- DAVID SHIP HIGHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION- WHO CO CHAIRED- I HEALTH AND SAFETY GROUP THAT WAS PART OF OUR- GUIDANCE TASK FORCE ALONG WITH EDGAR IS JUST WAIT- FROM THE- FROM MAX- THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS- THIS CHECKLIST YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IN DETAIL FROM MR SHIPP PIRA BUT IT HAS MANY OF THE THINGS THAT. WE CONSIDER TO BE MEDIUM MINIMUMS THE RECOMMENDATIONS- FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF AS YOU'LL SEE OUR GUIDANCE WILL TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF WEARING A FACE COVERING FOR STUDENTS AND FOR STAFF IT'LL TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TEMPERATURE TAKING SOME WILL BE IN A POSITION TO TAKE TEMPERATURE.

RULE TO MEAN WORST AFTER RIDE A BUS TO SCHOOL SOMETIMES FOR LAW DISTANCES WE HONOR. LEAVE THIS IS CRITICAL. THE GOAL BY AN ABERRATION LEE. AND SO WE'VE MADE DIRECT THAT HE ON A BUS SIX FEET IS I SHOULD BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY THAT THEY'LL BE PHYSICAL DISTANCING UP AND THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS WILL CONTINUE TO USE DISTANCE LEARNING UP BOTH BECAUSE OF THE REQUEST OF THE FAMILIES BUT ALSO AS A STRATEGY TO HELP MAKE THE CAMPUS SIZE SMALLER TO MAKE THE CAMPUS FOOT PRINT SMALLER TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AS THE CHIP XIN ARE AND IT SPEAKS ABOUT THEIR TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING HOUSE STAFF CAN BE CHANGED HOW STUDENTS CAN BE RANGE WE OWE THAT MANY MAY. MAKE DISTANCE LEARNING BUT WE KNOW THAT FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO COME TO SCHOOL THAT WE MAY SEE COHORTS THAT COME A FEW DAYS A WEEK. WE MAY EVEN SEE DIFFERENT SESSIONS BEING OFFERED ONE IN THE MORNING. AND ONE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'VE HEARD FROM DISTRICTS LIKE GLENDALE UNIFIED THAT PLAN TO STAGGER THEIR START TIMES THAT DAY TO ACCOMMODATE SMALLER CLASS SIZES THEY'RE- THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO AN AVERAGE OF TWELVE STUDENTS. PER CLASSROOM THAT MEANS THAT THEY'VE GOT A PARTNER WITH LIBRARIES AND COMMUNITY CENTERS TO EXPAND THE SPACE THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH FOR THE ENTIRE CAMPUS FOOT PRINT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HARD. BUT WE'RE REACHING OUT TO DISTRICT TO WORK WITH THEM AS THEY TO MAKE OUT HOW THEY CAN BUY THIS SPACE TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT OFFERINGS OF FOR STUDENTS AND SO. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION. THE COMMITTEE WILL HAVE THIS. DISTRICTS NEED TO HAVE IN PLACE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THIS TIME.

SO YOU ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO SPEAK ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE THE CHALLENGES THEY WILL FACE. AS WE PHASE IN AND EXTRADITED SEE HOW MUCH I'M I SPEAK FOR ALL OF.

ENTIRE FAMILIES AND BEYOND SO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE- MEMBERS DOES WITH THAT. RECEIVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND APPRECIATE THAT A KNOWLEDGE MEANT OF THE HARD WORK OUR MEMBERS OF THE JOINT BEEN DOING DURING THIS. DISCLOSURE GOOD MORNING I'M DAVID SHIPLER I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. WE REPRESENT NEARLY A QUARTER MILLION CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WORKING IN CALIFORNIA'S K. THROUGH FOURTEEN SYSTEM. I'M ALSO PROUD TO SPEAK TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LARGER EDUCATION LABOR COMMUNITY. SCHOOLS MUST BE A SAFE PLACE FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF. THAT IS ALWAYS OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM BUT THAT OBJECTIVE HAS NEW MEANING IN THE CO IN NINETEEN AIR. EVER SINCE SCHOOLS CLOSED IN MARCH LABOR ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN ENGAGE WITH THE MANAGEMENT GROUPS AND STATE OFFICIALS TO DEVELOP A PLAN. FOR RE OPENING FOR PHYSICAL INSTRUCTION OF STUDENTS. TO BE CLEAR. WE KNOW HOW TO REOPEN SCHOOLS. OUR MEMBERS DO WHATEVER YEAR USUALLY WITHOUT INCIDENT. BUT UNIQUE TIMES CALL FOR UNIQUE MEASURES. THAT'S WHY SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN ASKED ACTORS AS WHAT MY COUNTERPART AT THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND MYSELF TO LEAD A COMMITTEE TO CONSTRUCT ITEMS WITH SUPPORT FROM CITY. LEGISLATIVE STAFF HHS AND COUNTLESS OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO PLAN FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS AND STAFF ON SCHOOL SITES. AS THE SUPERINTENDENT SAID THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS WILL BE CONSIDERED WHAT IT TAKES TO RE OPEN SCHOOL SAFELY. WE HAVE BEEN COGNIZANT OF DISTINCT LOCAL CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOLS MIGHT BE BE UTILIZED VERY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS REPORING THE CAMPUS AT A TIME IN ORDER TO MEET PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. SOME SCHOOLS WILL HAVE STAGGERED SCHEDULES OTHERS MIGHT USE COHORTS SOME SCHOOLS MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO MANAGE DISTANCE IT WITHOUT SCHEDULING JAMES. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WHICH SHOULD BE ADDRESSED CONSISTENTLY. ACROSS THE STATE. TO MEET THE HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS OF EVERY CALIFORNIA STUDENT AND STAFF PERSON. OUR COMMITTEE REFER TO THESE SORTS OF GUIDELINES AS UNIVERSAL TRUTHS. FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS AND STAFF WITH TEMPERATURES OVER A HUNDRED POINT FOUR DEGREES SHOULD BE SENT HOME WHETHER YOU'RE IN OAKLAND OR CURSED LONG BEACH FOR A LONG TIME. EVERY CALIFORNIA STUDENT AND ALL SCHOOL EMPLOYEES DESERVE THE SORTS OF MINIMUM PROTECTIONS. BOTH SETS OF GUIDANCE THE CITY PH AND SEE YOU GUYS BEING DISCUSSED THIS MORNING PROVIDE RELATIVELY COMPREHENSIVE SET OF GUIDELINES FOR RE OPENING SAFELY. THE EDUCATION LABOR COMMUNITY IS GENERALLY SUPPORT OF. OF BOTH OF THESE SETS OF GUIDELINES. THE LABOR COMMUNITY IS THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE HAD FEEDBACK IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING THE C. PH GUIDANCE AND YOU HAD A DIRECT ROLE IN WORKING WITH MANAGEMENT GROUPS CD AND PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES TO BUILD THE CD REOPEN CHECKLIST. SEE YOU GUIDANCE ANSWERS MANY OF THE QUESTIONS FOLKS MEDICATION COMMUNITY ARE ASKING. LIKE HOW TO ADDRESS PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS THE SUBJECT OF WHICH I'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CHAIR WOMAN. THE CDC GUIDANCE MAKES CLEAR. THAT BOTH STAFF AND STUDENTS SHOULD WEAR FACE COVERINGS ON CAMPUSES AND IN SCHOOL VEHICLES. WE APPRECIATE THAT CD ANSI PIZZA RECOGNIZED THAT SOME EMPLOYEES WILL BE MORE ROBUST PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT DEPENDING ON THEIR JOB DUTIES. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF CALLAWAY YES IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ALONG WITH HEAVY DOSES OF ADVOCACY FOR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND OF BOTH CHAMBERS. TO PRODUCE AND PROCURE FACE COVERINGS AND ADDITIONAL IT MEANT LIKE SURGICAL MASKS AND NINETY FIVE'S FACE SHIELDS AND DISPOSABLE GLOVES FOR SOME CLASSROOM EDUCATORS. WORKER BUS DRIVERS FRONT OFFICE STAFF AND FOOD SERVICE FOLKS AND CUSTODIANS. FOR WILL BE TASKED WITH NEW AND DUTIES LET FORMING SYMPTOMS INCLUDING CHAPTER CHECKS. AS STUDENTS AND STAFF AND- BUSES AND CAMPUSES TO PREVENT COVERT NINETEEN POSITIVE STUDENTS STAFF AND VISITORS FROM ENTERING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND VEHICLES. THE CRITICAL WORK WILL REQUIRE TRAINING EQUIPMENT AND THE NECESSARY STAFF TO KEEP OUR CAMPUSES SAFE. AS THE SUPERINTENDENT MENTION CUSTODIANS WILL HAVE TO OPERATE UNDER ENHANCE CLEANING AND DISINFECTING PROTOCOLS TO SERVICES LIKE DOOR HANDLES HANDRAILS AND SINKS SERVICES LIKE DESK TABLES CHAIRS SCHOOL BUS BENCHES MIGHT NEED TO BE CLEAN BETWEEN USES. SCHOOL FOR LIKE WE NEED MORE STAFF PORT NOT LESS TO MEET THE NEW STANDARDS. WE APPRECIATE THIS LEGISLATURE'S WORK IN RECENT DAYS AND WEEKS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. CVE ALSO RECOMMENDS. ARE COMPLYING WITH THE STRICT PHYSICAL DISTANCING STANDARDS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED BY THE CDC SIXTY MINIMUM DISTANCING WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION THE PASSED THE BUSES AND CLASSROOMS IN MANY CASES. HEALTH EXPERTS AGREE THAT ALONG WITH HAND WASHING AND FACE COVERINGS PHYSICAL DISTANCING IS CRITICAL TO PREVENT SPREAD ESPECIALLY TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING MANY STUDENTS FAMILY MEMBERS AND MANY OF OUR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. THE CITY GUIDE ALSO ADDRESSES THE ACUTE NEEDS OF SCHOOL EMPLOYEES TO FACILITATETHEIR ABILITY TO KEEP CAMPUS IS SAFE FOR EVERYONE. OUR MEMBERS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS GUIDANCE AND WE BELIEVE EXECUTION OF THE PARTICLES THERE IN WILL GIVE US THE BEST CHANCE OF KEEPING STUDENTS AND STAFF SAFE. SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE WILL BE SUFFICIENT STAFFING RATIOS TO IMPLEMENT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY pGUIDANCE WITH FIDELITY. THE DOCUMENT MAKES CLEAR THE STAFFING LEVELS MUST BE QUOTE SUFFICIENT TO MEET UNIQUE FACILITY CLEANLINESS PHYSICAL DISTANCING STUDENT LEARNING AND HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE EDUCATION LABOR COMMUNITY HAS ASKED LEGISLATIVE LEADERS TO PREVENT LAY OFS FOR ALL SCHOOL EMPLOYEES SO SCHOOLS CAN MEET THESE GOALS. THE CDC GUIDANCE ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF. FOR EMPLOYEES WHO NORMALLY HAS TO WORK IN CLOSE QUARTERS CHANGES IN PHYSICAL WORKS SPACES MAY BE NECESSARY. DOES WILL LIKE WE NEED TO BE RE ARRANGED PHYSICAL BARRIERS MAY NEED TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN SOME CASES THESE MODIFICATIONS THAT PROTECTIONS WILL ALSO REQUIRE RESOURCES. LEDS ARE ALSO ASKED TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT STAFF WHO ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR SEVERE ILLNESS. BY PROVIDING OPTIONS SUCH AS TELEWORK OR NEGOTIATED CHANGES AND CLASSIFICATION WE'RE DUTIES. SOMETIMES SUCH ACCOMMODATIONS MAY NOT BE PRACTICABLE. IN THOSE CASES ELEAZAR ASKED TO WORK WITH THE EMPLOYEE TO DEVELOPING LEAVE PLAN THAT AVOIDS EXHAUSTING THE EMPLOYEES OR LEAF. A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES SHOULD NOT BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR LIVELIHOOD OR ROBBED OF THEIR OWN BENEFITS BECAUSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES TOTALLY BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. EMPLOYEES MUST ALSO RECEIVE THE TRAINING NECESSARY TO DO THEIR JOBS UNDER THESE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. SUBSTANTIAL TRAINING BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOLS REOPEN WILL BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE VIGILANCE IN MEETING THESE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS TO KEEP EVERYONE SAFE. FINALLY ELEAZAR INSTRUCTED TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES AND LABOR GROUPS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY AND TAILORING BARGAINING AGREEMENTS TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES IDEALLY BEFORE SCHOOLS ARE REOPENED. CSE IS MEMBERS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE OTHER EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GUIDANCE LOOK FORWARD TO SCHOOLS RE OPENING AND SEEING OUR STUDENTS IN PERSON AGAIN.

USUAL THAT HAVE AN INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN- CD IS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT'S MISTER THURMAN'S DEPARTMENT OR SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION OF YOU'VE HEARD SPEAK TWICE. AND ELLIE A IS LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY WHICH IS TYPICALLY. A SCHOOL DISTRICT'S SO WHEN YOU HEARD THOSE TERMS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THEY'RE REFERENCING US WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO- AGAIN THEY CAN STRUCTURE FIRE WE'RE GOING TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. IS DOCTOR KATIE MCNAMARA. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SOUTH BAY UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S DOWN IN SAN DIEGO- SHE IS JOINING US BY A REMOTE- Y. VIDEO FEED FROM THE SAN DIEGO. COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AGAIN DOCTOR KATIE MCNAMARA. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. VERY NICE BACKGROUND ARE YOU REALLY OUTSIDE. THAT'S GREAT I REALLY OUTSIDE I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT THANK YOU TO BEAUTIFUL SAN DIEGO DAY. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR KATIE MCNAMARA AND I AM THE SUPERINTENDENT IN THE SOUTH BAY UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT AT THE BORDER OF MEXICO IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WITH SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PRE CHOOL THROUGH EIGHTH GADE STUDENTS. OF WHICH FOSTER YOUTH OR SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. I AM ALSO THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ACCESS SUPERINTENDENTS COUNCIL PRESIDENT AND I WAS PRIVILEGED TO BE THE CHAIR OF THE AXE EVERY OPENING SCHOOLS TASK FORCE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. I CONSIDER IT AN HONOR TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. IN MY THIRTY FOUR YEARS I EDUCATION I HAVE TRULY NEVER EXPERIENCED A MORE CHALLENGING TIME FOR OUR PROFESSION. IN THE CONTEXT OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND WITH THE SOCIAL UNREST WE ARE EXPERIENCING AS A COUNTRY. WE HAVE NEVER NEEDED YOU AND STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP MORE. THE JOB EVERY OPENING SCHOOLS IS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. THE AXE THE RE OPENING SCHOOLS TASK FORCE DEVELOPED A CALL TO ACTION FOR CLEAR HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS ESSENTIAL STANDARDS FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING FUNDING AND FLEXIBILITY. MY ENTIRE CAREER HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT OPPORTUNITY GAPS AND CHAMPIONING EQUITY UNCOVERING DIFFERENCES IN THE SCHOOL EXPERIENCES OF OUR CHILDREN. TODAY I STAND BEFORE YOU CONSIDERING HOW VERY ALIKE SCHOOLS HAVE ACTUALLY BàN. AND HOW WORRIED MY COLLEAGUES ARE AS THEY DESCRIBE OUR NEW SITUATION AS BEING IN THE WILD WILD WEST. WHILE THIS PANEL IS FOCUSED ON HEALTH AND SAFETY IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT GREATER EROSION TO CONSISTENCY OF LEARNING EXPERIENCES WILL FURTHER EXACERBATE THE INEQUITIES THAT HAVE PLAGUED OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS. WHEN I FIRST READ THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INDUSTRY GUIDANCE DOCUMENT AND STRONGER TOGETHER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION GUIDE BOOK I WAS RELIEVED THAT THE SPIRIT AND INTENTIONS OF THESE DOCUMENTS WERE A LINE TO WHAT I HAD BEEN PLANNING. FOR MY SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICTS. I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT WHEN THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF ALIGNMENT FOR SOME OF MY SUPERINTENDENT COLLEAGUES. ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE LEADERS WHO BELIEVE IF WE OPEN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS AT ALL WE WILL BE FINANCIALLY DEVASTATED BY LAWSUITS WHEN WE CAN'T POSSIBLY GUARANTEED. THAT EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS ARE COMPLETELY SAFE. ON THE OTHER HAND SOME LEADERS ARE IMAGINING OPENING SIMILARLY TO THE WAY WE CLOSED IN MARCH. AS AN EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE SAYS TEACH AND REINFORCE USE OF CLOCK FACE COVERINGS MASTER FACE SHIELDS. BUT THE CDC GUIDE BOOK SAYS IF AN ALLEY A REQUIRES STUDENTS TO WEAR FACE COVERINGS THEN THE ELLIE A MUST PROVIDE FACE COVERINGS TO BE USED. ALTHOUGH I'M NOT ONE OF THEM SOME LEADERS HAVE INTERPRETED THAT TO MEAN THAT MASKS ARE NOT REQUIRED AND NO LONGER PART OF PLANNING FOR RE OPENING. IF THE INTENT WAS UNIFORMITY OF DIRECTION IT IS TURNING OUT TO BE QUITE VARIED IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION. WITH SEVENTY SIX PAGES OF DIRECTION IN THESE JUST TO DOCUMENTS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN RECEIVED THE NEXT ANTICIPATED DIRECTION FROM OUR COUNTY OFFICE SAYS. ONE OF THE STRONGEST RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE OXYTOCIN FORCE WAS FOR CONSISTENCY AND WE CONTINUE TO NEED AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IN THE MOST REASONABLY CONSISTENT MANNER. THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY IN OPENING SCHOOL IS VERY HIGH I MADE A LIST OF NEW ROUTINES TEACHERS WILL NEED TO TEACH. JUST ARRIVING TO SCHOOL INVOLVES LEARNING WHAT TO DO ABOUT STOCK HOW TO GET ON A BUS HOW TO SIT HOW TO GET OFFTHE BUS HOW DO ARRIVE ON THE SCHOOL CAMPUS HOW TO GET YOUR TEMPERATURE AS FAST WHERE TO GO IF YOU'RE ALLOWED ENTRANCE AND IF NOT. HOW THE HALLWAYS ARE DESIGNATED FOR POUNDS OF TRAVEL AND MORE. I HAVE THOUGHT OF FIFTEEN SEPARATE VIDEOS THAT WOULD TAKE A MINIMUM OF TWENTY MINUTES IN LENGTH. FIVE HOURS OF CONTENT TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE COMING TO SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST TIME AT FIVE YEARS OLD. AND FOR UPPER MIDDLE GRADE SCHOOLERS WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RE LEARN YEARS OF PRACTICE WITH THE ROUTINES OF THE PAST. THIS FEELS CLOSE TO IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT MORE STAFF. EVEN WITH THE POTENTIAL ROSIER FINANCIAL PICTURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN DISCUSSING I AM CONFIDENT THAT I WILL BE MAKING CUTS TO PERSONNEL IN OUR FUTURE BOARD MEETINGS. FURTHER DISTRICTS MUST SPECIFICALLY AND ACCURATELY REASSESS THEIR OPENING PLANS BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THE IMPACTS AND EFFECTS OF THOSE PLANS WITH THEIR LABOR PARTNERS. GREATER DIRECTION FROM THE STATE MAKES THAT EASIER. WE HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE WORK OF ADULTS DOES NOT COMPROMISE A SINGLE DAY OF HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION FOR A CHILD. LAST THE GUIDANCE FROM MULTIPLE AGENCIES THAT IS SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY HAS NOT SOFTENED THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY I FEEL TO BE THE FINAL AUTHORITY RELATED TO MATTERS ASSOCIATED WITH THREE OPENING MY SCHOOLS. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AUTHORITY OF WHO SHOULD BE MAKING THE CALL O CLOSING AND REOPENING SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE FIELD AND WE CONTINUE TO SEEK GUIDANCE. I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT WEBINARS ARE COUNCIL MEETING AND DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE SUPPORTED OUR WORK AND I'M SO INCREDIBLY. FOR YOUR INTEREST IN HEARING MY REFLECTION ON THE WAY A- THANK YOU ARE TO RENT DR MCNAMARA. AT A IS A GREAT QUESTION ABOUT LIABILITY THAT YOU BROUGHT UP FOR SURE- AND ALSO THE GUIDANCE SOMETIMES CONFLICTS SO I THINK WE MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THAT COMING UP. ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR LAST WITNESS OF PANEL NUMBER ONE AND AGAIN OUR FINAL SPEAKER FOR THIS PANEL IS CAROL GREEN. SHE IS WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA AND SHE IS ALSO JOINING US FROM OUR LOCATION YOUR LOCATION IN SAN DIEGO. AGAIN A SCREAM OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE- PTA. THANK YOU SO MUCH YES WERE OUTSIDE AND DEFINITELY SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE PAST FEW MONTHS HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES CALIFORNIA STATE PDAS BEEN ASKING PARENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HOW THINGS ARE GOING AND IN SUCH A LARGE DIVERSE STATE YOU MIGHT IMAGINE WE'RE NOT GETTING SINGLE ANSWERS BUT THERE ARE A FEW UNIVERSAL THEMES THAT KEEP EMERGING THEY SEEM TO FALL INTO THREE MAIN CATEGORIES. CONCERNS ABOUT THE SOCIAL NO WELL BEING OF CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES AND TEACHERS CONCERNS ABOUT COMMUNICATION PARENTS WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT THE SCHOOL PLANS TO DO AND WHAT THIS PROCESS WILL BE LIKE IT ALSO LIKE TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS. CONCERNS FOR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED FAMILIES AND OTHER VULNERABLE STUDENTS ALL KIDS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IN THIS PROCESS. CALIFORNIA STATE PTA WAS PART OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S RE OPENING TASK FORCE AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SHARE THE PARENT PERSPECTIVE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. WE SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF STRONGER TOGETHER AND ALSO SUPPORT THE DECISION THAT MOST DECISIONS WILL BE MADE BY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. PTA HEARD FROM PARENTS ACROSS THE STATE AND IN MAY WE HELD A LISTENING SESSION I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE QUOTES WE RECEIVE FROM PARENTS. KATE A MOTHER OF ONE SON SAID I HAVE GOOD DAYS AND BAD DAYS BUT THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ASPECT IS THE HARDEST MY SON IS MISSING HIS FRIENDS. AND HE HAS TO STAY HOME WITH ME ALL DAY. A MOM OF THREE SAID IT'S HARD TO HEAR MY KIDS CRYING THEY MISS THEIR TEACHERS AND THEIR FRIENDS. THEY'RE AFRAID AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL THEM. REBEKAH A MOM OF TWO SAID PERSONALLY I'M GREAT BUT I'M COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED FROM THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. THE SCHOOLS NOT TELLING US ANYTHING WE HEAR DIFFERENT THINGS ON THE NEWS IT'S NOT SAFE IT IS SAFE SCHOOLS WILL OPEN SCHOOLS ONE OPEN THEY'LL CHANGE SCHEDULE REQUIRE MATH. JUST TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON. MICHELLE A MOM OF HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES SAID I'M NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION LOOKS LIKE WITH THE CUTS TO EDUCATION BINDING. AND AARON SAID I WISH THERE WERE MORE SUPPORT FOR PARENTS THROUGH THIS PROCESS. HOW DEAR SAID I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH WITH THINGS OPENING UP. BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT HERE HOW PARENTS INCLUDING MYSELF ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK. AND I WISH I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. SHAUNA MY KIDS WANT DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS BUT NOT BEING ALLOWED TO GO PLACES THEY'RE JUST NOT USED TO IT OR THEY'RE JUST USED TO BEING HOME IT WILL BE ESPECIALLY TOUGH. WHEN THEY HAD BACK TO SCHOOL. TALKED ABOUT TANTRUMS AND MELTDOWNS CONCERNS ABOUT TOO MUCH SCREEN TIME. AND NO WAY TO TURN OFF THE NEWS AND THEY ALL SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH ESPECIALLY WHEN CHILDREN RETURN TO SCHOOL. WHEN TALKING ABOUT RETURNING TO SCHOOL PARENTS MENTION THEIR KIDS WERE AFRAID CONCERNS ABOUT COVERT NINETEEN ABOUT KIDS WEARING MASKS ABOUT TOUCHING ABOUT HUGGING ABOUT BEING ALONE ABOUT BEING IN GROUPS. AND ABOUT BULLYING. ANOTHER MAJOR CONCERN PARENTS HAD WAS GETTING ACCURATE INFORMATION THEY SAID THEY FELT DISCONNECTED THEY WERE HEARING CONFLICTING MESSAGES AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE OR HOW TO GET ACCURATE INFORMATION. PTA STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT SCHOOLS ENGAGE FAMILIES EARLY IN THE RE OPENING PROCESS INCLUDE THEM IN THE DISCUSSION IN THE DECISION MAKING. AND AS SCHOOL SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND PROTOCOLS PARENTS CAN BE PART OF THE PROCESS AND EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS WHEN FAMILIES HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHY THE ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN. THEN THEY CAN HELP SUPPORT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING PUT FORWARD. WE SUGGEST ENGAGING FAMILIES AND ACTIVITIES TO HELP THEM FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WHEN RETURNING TO SCHOOL. PARENTS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT. SCHOOLS THEY SAY SHOULD HAVE EXTRA THERMOMETERS WIPES MASK WHATEVER IS NEEDED. AND PARENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCE SEEN PROPER HAND WASHING AND MAKING SURE THEIR BASIC THINGS LIKE SOAP AND PAPER TOWELS IN THE BATHROOM. THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE EXTRA THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE WILL BE EXTRA CANCELAR IS NURSES AND STAFF TO ADDRESS THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL THE TRAUMA AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AS THEY RETURN TO SCHOOL. THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BALANCE THEIR WORK SCHEDULES WITH PROPOSED FLEX SCHEDULES PLEASE KEEP IN MIND FAMILIES THAT HAVE MORE THAN ONE CHILD AND NAY THAN HAVE THEM A DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. MOST OF ALL. FAMILIES WANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE SAFE AND HEALTHY IN OUR SCHOOLS THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WHAT WE GO TO QUESTIONS NOW AND I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR A COUPLE THE PRESENTERS. AND ALL US A QUESTION KIND OF. AN EXPEDITED FASHION IF YOU COULD RESPOND IN AN EXPEDITED FASHION YES WE DO OF OTHERS SPEAKERS AND OTHER FOLKS UP HERE THE PROBABLY WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS. IF YOU COULD JUST AGAIN LIMIT YOUR RESPONSE TO YOU KNOW GIVE US THE INFORMATION WE NEED BUT- BUT AGAIN JUST SO WE CAN GET THROUGH ALL OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE UP HERE- THE FIRST QUESTION IS FOR DOCTOR CHAVEZ. THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION YOU SAW SOME FROM THE SOME- FROM SOME OF THE PRESENTERS WHERE AND THERE APPEARS TO BE A CONFLICT IN SOME OF THE GUIDANCE FROM- THE- CD E. VERSE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IS THERE A PLAN TO MAYBE- FIGURE THAT OUT SO THAT GUIDANCE DOESN'T APPEAR TO COMPLEX THERE'S GONNA EXAMPLES FACE COVERING.CD SAYS- THAT AT A MINIMUM FACE COVERING SHOULD BE WORN- CD PH- SAYS STUDENTS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED SO THERE'S A BIT OF A DISCONNECT THERE. DO YOU KNOW IF ANY. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO FIX IT TODAY BUT AS OUR PLAN FOR THE DEPARTMENTS TO COMMUNICATE TO THE SCHOOLS AND GET. KIND OF A CONSISTENT. CONSISTENT GUIDANCE. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA WE WILL BE HAPPY TO AYE ENGAGE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES HAD TO THE E. AND- OFFLINE ON COMMON GROUND US ON YOU KNOW WE EACH HAD OUR GUIDANCE FIRST ON AND AS I INDICATED THAT IS BASED ON ON OUR BEST THINKING AT THE TIME- BUT- WE CERTAINLY CAN- MEET AND- UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND IF WE THINK THAT ARE WE NEED TO UPDATE OUR GUIDANCE WE WILL AND THEY NEED TO UPDATE THING I ASK PERHAPS THEY WILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- THAT COMMITMENT- IT JUST TOOK A COUPLE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT WE WOULD COME OUT OF YOUR WILL HOUSE. DO WE DO WE HAVE THE FOOD IS THERE A SPECIFIC TYPE OF MASK BEING REQUIRED IS THAT TO FIND IN ANY OF THE GUIDANCE. YES WE REFERRED TO- FACE COVERINGS- THAT- CAME BE EITHER MADE FROM CLOTH. OR THEY CAN BE MADE FROM MATERIALS. LIKE IN SURGICAL MASKS. AS YOU HEARD EARLIER- WE ARE WORKING VERY ACTIVELY ON YOU KNOW ACTUALLY SUPPLYING SCHOOLS SOME OF THIS MATERIALS. AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THE L. LOCATIONS THAT WE WILL BE GIVEN TO COUNTIES TO PROVIDE TO SCHOOLS. AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE WILL HAVE BOTH ANA. CLOTH FACE COVERINGS AS WELL AS- SURGICAL MASK FACE COVERINGS. AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THAT IS- THE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNOR MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT COUPLE WEEKS AGO. TWO THREE WEEKS AGO ABOUT THE STATE PROCURING THAT FOR THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HOW THAT GET TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS GOING TO THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. OR IS IT GOING TO THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. DO YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY I SAW YESTERDAY THAT THERE IS DONE ON A LOCATION TABLE ALREADY THAT IS BASED ON ON SCHOOLS AND ON COUNTIES- AND THERE ARE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WILL BE GETTING THOSE ON OUR TO COMMUNITIES BUT I'M NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY GO TO COUNTY. HEALTH DEPARTMENT SORT TO ON SUPER SO OUT OF SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SO I WOULD JUST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WE GO TO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION BECAUSE I THINK I DISTRIBUTION WILL BE MUCH SMOOTHER MUCH MORE DIRECT AND THE COUNTY ARE OF THAT THE COUNTY- HELP OUR AND SOMETIMES HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES NOT THEY'RE NOT GREAT PEOPLE IN DOING IT MISSION. THIS IS CARED FOR SCHOOL I TO GO TO SCHOOL SITES AND I GET. I THINK THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE'LL JUST. AS THE- COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AGAIN WITH REGARD TO LIABILITY. THERE'S BEEN NO EXECUTIVE ORDER WITH REGARD TO LIABILITY. AT THIS POINT AS I UNDERSTAND US BECAUSE FAR AS A DEMO FINING SCHOOLS BECAUSE SCHOOLS COULD. EVENTUALLY COME A LAWSUIT MACHINE. WRITING COULD CRIPPLE THE SYSTEM. WITH A POTENTIAL LAWSUITS DUE. TO BE AGAIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S ISSUED NOTHING WITH REGARD TO. TO LIABILITY OR INDEMNIFICATION IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT TO MY KNOWLEDGE BUT I'M NOT A 100% CERTAIN ABOUT THAT BUT WE CAN COVER LOOK OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN JUST. JUST JOB MAYBE FROM RESCUE THERMAL JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL THAT I TEACH IT WAS HAS PROXIMITY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS. BERMAN HIGH SCHOOL- TYPICALLY THE LARGEST HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE THAT'S THAT THAT'S NON VIRTUAL. AND STUDENT ACTUALLY ATTEND- IN THE CHALLENGES AND I'M SURE YOU LOOK KNOWLEDGE AS TO MR THURMAN THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHECKING THE TEMPERATURE. OF EVERY STUDENT AS THEY ENTER THE SCHOOL SITE EVERY DAY ARE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT ON THAT. AS FOR MR THURMAN. I'D LIKE TO COMMENT IF I COULD GET MY MICROPHONE YOUR LIFE. YOUR LIFE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH DISTRICTS ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY- IN ACCOMMODATING SPACE AND IN MANY DISTRICTS ARE LITERALLY MEASURING. TO SEE HOW MANY STUDENTS THEY CAN SHARE AS I MENTIONED IN IN GLENDALE THEY'RE- GONNA USE- PARTNER FACILITIES TO HELP THEM ACCOMMODATE THE SPACE- BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT PP ABOUT PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DELIVERED TO ALL THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND IF YOU WANT WE HAVE AMOUNTS OF FACIAL COVERINGS AND I HAND SANITIZER AND THINGS OF THAT AND SHIELDS THERE'S BEEN SHIELDS DELIVERED FOR EVERY TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE FACE COVERINGS AND THE HAND SANITIZER WE CAN PROVIDE YOU THAT INFORMATION IF YOU LIKE IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION ON THE LOGISTICS FOR THE VERIFICATION OF THE WITNESSES- AND JUST- QUESTION FOR MR SURE PIRA- WITH YOUR SUPPLIER OF IT WE HAD CONVERSATIONS THIS YEAR. AFTER THIS CRISIS HAD ABOUT THAT GETTING YOUR FOLKS ON THE GROUND ADEQUATE PP TODAY DO THEY HAVE ADEQUATE BE PAY DAY DO THEY HAVE. WOULD BE. QUESTION ON THE- AND THE FOLKS CONTINUE TO STUDENTS SO A TO SIR THROUGH THE FOOD SERVICE AND BECAUSE STORY IN SOME CASES WE HAVE BUS DRIVERS DELIVERING MEALS AS YOU KNOW EARLY ON A CRISIS DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO EVEN FACE COVERINGS LET ALONE GLOVES HAND SANITIZER ABILITY TO WASH THEIR HANDS FREQUENTLY IN SOME CASES. I WOULD SAY TOWARD THE END OF APRIL- THE SUPPLIES REALLY STARTED FREEING UP. AND AT THIS POINT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE PP. AT EAST FACE COVERINGS MAYBE MAYBE NOT SURGICAL MASKS OR WERE AND NINETY FIVES HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO ALL OF OUR MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE THE QUESTION IS. IS THERE ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THEM TO CONTINUE GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LOOKING FOR HELP FROM THE S. P. I. N. FROM CALLAWAY YES. AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED A PLAN NOT TOO MANY THAT NOT JUST A FEW JUST A FEW WEEKS WE NOTICED A PLAN TO DO JUST THAT WERE IN THE STATE WILL PROCURE THOSE MATERIALS THAT AGAIN AS WE- SHARED. GET THEM DOWN TO THE ALLEY ACE SO THANK YOU. OFFER ME TURN TO THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTIONS ANY QUESTIONS. MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MY FOR A QUESTION IS FOR SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN AS WELL. FIRST I AS HE'S GETTING BACK SWITCHED OVER ON LET ME THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU PERSONALLY AND CD HAS DONE DURING THIS TIME I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A LOT OF WEBINARS BUT I DIDN'T GET THAT THIRTY CENTS MARCH THIRTY AND THAT'S RIDLEY GREAT- SO MY QUESTION- MISTER SUPERINTENDENT IS. DO YOU THINK THAT CD IS GUIDANCE TO SCHOOLS IS SUFFICIENT. THERE ARE A LOT OF DECISIONS THAT EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL HAVE TO MAKE. WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MADAM CHAIR- YOU KNOW THE GUIDANCE REPRESENTS THE BEST INFORMATION THAT WE KNOW NOW AND YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR ON A DAILY BASIS BETWEEN NOW AND SCHOOLS WE OPEN IN THE FALL- BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW MANY OF THE PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS ARE CHANGING. AND WE NEED TO MONITOR THAT AND ADJUST THE GUIDANCE AS NECESSARY AND SO WE ENVISION- YOU KNOW THIS IS A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT THAT CHANGES OVER TIME BUT WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE BASED ON THE SIZE THAT WE KNOW NOW THE STRONGEST RECOMMENDATIONS- IN I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE SUGGESTED THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WE MIGHT OF EQUIVOCATE IT ON FACE COVERINGS BUT WE'RE MAKING THE STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION THAT ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF WE'RE A FACE COVERING IN EVERY IN EVERY ACTIVITY IT WAS A HARD PROCESS BUT OUR TASK FORCE ON THE OPENING- REALLY HAD A STRONG PARTICIPATORY PROCESS THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER TEACHERS. CLASSIFIED STAFF ADMINISTRATORS AND PARENTS AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL THOSE WHO HELPED PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AND SO THIS IS THE BEST INFORMATION WE HAVE AT THIS TIME WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND UPDATE THE GUIDANCE AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE SO REALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S A LIVING DOCUMENT THAT'S PERFECT THIS IS WHAT I HAVE NOW AN UPDATE AS WE GET MORE INFORMATION PERFECT- BECAUSE THE GUIDANCE IS NOT MANDATORY. WHAT SHOULD BE ON A PARTICULAR ELOISE THE CHANCE TO RE OPEN- WITH CLEARLY INSUFFICIENT MODIFICATION INSUFFICIENT. HELLO FOR AT THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WILL SPEAK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE ONLY AGENCIES IN THE STATE THAT REALLY HAVE ANY ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES- IN THIS AREA WOULD BE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. NOW OF COURSE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHEN THINGS CAN BE MORE FLEXIBLE OR WHEN THINGS HAVE TO BE MORE RESTRICTED AS YOU'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. COUNTY HEALTH OFICERS ARE MAKING DECISIONS TO SAY THAT COUNTIES CAN REOPEN ALTHOUGH THERE'S STILL REQUIRING SOME IN SOME CASES A FACIAL COVERING AND THEY'RE RECOMMENDING ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING. AS IT RELATES TO HAND WASHING- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- OUR GUIDANCE IS ADVISORY- AND BUT WE HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH EVERYONE OF THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS WE'VE HELD NUMEROUS. WEB CALLS- WE'RE WE'VE HOSTED A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALL AT ONCE WE'VE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO DO THE SAME THING WE'VE EVEN CONVENE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS. WITH COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS THAT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE BUT WE DO IT BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE. YOU CAN TIMES. WHAT THEY'RE MIXED MESSAGE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO ALIGN OUR MESSAGES AS BEST AS POSSIBLE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU REGIONAL- COLLABORATIONS WITH. COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS IN THEIR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS TO PROVIDE THE BEST INFORMATION THAT WE CAN IN THE MOST CONSISTENT CLEAR INFORMATION THAT WE CAN- TO OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE OUR PARENTS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR EDUCATORS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SUPERINTENDENT. PLEASE LET THE LEGISLATURE KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN BE HELPFUL WITH. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN TO BE HELPFUL WHAT THE BUDGET THAT THE LEGISLATURE BOUGHT FOR IT IS VERY HELPFUL- I THINK THE FACT THAT IT RESTORES THE CUTS- IS IMPORTANT. I DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN REALLY CLEAR THAT THEY NEED ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR PP RIGHT NOW OUR SCHOOLS. I'M GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR A OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR PROVIDING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR SIXTY DAYS. BUT THAT AS AN ONGOING COST THIS IS A PLACE WHERE SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO NEED SUPPORT FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AS WELL AS- AS YOU KNOW FROM YOUR CHAIR BEING CO CHAIR ON OUR JUST ON OUR- CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE GROUP- THERE CONTINUES TO BE A GREAT NEED. OF FOR DIVERT COMPUTING DEVICES IN HOT SPOTS FOR STUDENTS AND SO THESE ARE THE PLACES WHERE WE BELIEVE THE STATE HAS THE ABILITY. THE STATE'S MADE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR INTERNET AND THAT'S INCREDIBLE. WE ALSO NEED THE STATE TO USE ITS BUYING POWER TO HELP PURCHASE LOW COST COMPUTING DEVICES AND HOT SPOTS FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND TO HELP THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH THE COST OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. PERFECT I MADE A LIST. I MADE A LIST THANK THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER KALRA THANK THIS IS SURE THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT BUT THURMOND AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU IN YOUR DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN DOING- ONE COLLABORATION WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP- AND THE LAST PORTION OF WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED. IT WAS PART OF WHAT I WAS IN ASSN TERMS OF. DISTANCE LEARNING AS WELL AS LEARNING LOSS AND WE KNOW THAT- THE GAP EVEN BEING IN SILICON VALLEY. AND SAN JOSE WE SEE SUCH A DISPARITY IN BEING ABLE TO GET THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT INTERNET ACCESS WHAT HAVE YOU TO SO MANY FAMILIES- AND IN PARTS OF SAN JOSE AND BEYOND. AND SO AS WE GO INTO THE NEXT YEAR WE KNOW. ASSUME THAT ALTHOUGH WE WANT OUR STUDENTS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM AND DISTANCE LEARNING AND THOSE TOOLS ARE NOW GOING TO BE PART OF THE NEW NORMAL IN THE INTERNET AND IN TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS INTERACTING WITH OUR STUDENTS AND SO SPECIFIC TO THE LEARNING LOSS OF THOSE ARE STILL TRYING TO CATCH UP AND GET THAT EQUIPMENT I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S SPOKEN A LOT. ON THAT OF IN TERMS OF CERTAIN POPULATIONS THAT ARE GONNA BE FURTHER BEHIND AS I JUST DOES ANY THOUGHTS YOU HAVE ON THAT IN TERMS OF NOT JUST REGION I DO A DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT KIND OF THIS NEW NORMAL OF A CORPORATE IN DISTANCE LEARNING BUT WHAT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS MIGHT BE IN TERMS OF HELPING THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE PART OF FAR. FALLING FURTHER BY. THROUGH THIS. ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALL THE QUESTION WE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH SOME STUDENTS IN YOUR ASSEMBLY DISTRICT TWO WERE WE LIKE TO RE CONNECT YOU WITH THEY WERE SO IMPRESSIVE THAT THEY WANTED TO JOIN OUR EFFORTS IN RAISING MONEY- FOR COMPUTING DEVICES- VERY PROUD OF YOU YOUR STUDENTS AND ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO ACCELERATE LEARNING AND- IN SO IN THAT RESPECT FIRST IT STARTS WITH TEACHERS ASSESSING WERE STUDENT ENTERS INTO THEY NEED SUPPORTS TO HELP THEM TO REALLY ENTER N GRADE LEVEL- TEACHERS ARE REALLY THE BEST LEADERS TO HELP MAKE THOSE INTERVENTIONS. BUT WE CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS IN RICHMOND PROGRAMS TO HELP PROVIDE SUPPORTS TO OUR STUDENTS LATER THIS WEEK WILL BE MEETING WITH A NUMBER OF OUR PARTNERS WHO RELEASED DATA THAT SHOWED THERE IS A WIDE DISPARITY IN THE EXPERIENCE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO- ASIAN STUDENTS LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHOSE EXPERIENCE IN DISTANCE LEARNING WAS VERY BUMPY AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS GET ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY NEEDED AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL BE DOING IS PROVIDING MORE TRAINING ON HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT DISTANCE LEARNING LOOKS THE SAME NOT THAT ONE SIZE SHOULD FIT ALL. BUT THERE SHOULD BE CERTAIN STANDARDS AND BASICS THAT CAN BE EXPECTED AND ABOUT HOW DISTANCE LEARNING IS PROVIDED LET'S JUST FACE T OUR WHOLE ENTIRE NATION MOVING TO DISTANCE LEARNING OVERNIGHT WITH NO TRAINING WITH NO ABILITY TO DO THIS AND SO I'M GRATEFUL FOR WHAT ARE EDGY YEARS HAVE DONE ON VERY SHORT NOTICE IN THE MOST URGENT OF SITUATIONS BUT AS WE GO FORWARD WE KNOW NOW THAT WE NEED TO BE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE CALL CONTINUITY OF LEARNING EVEN HEAR A LOT ABOUT IT. IN THE NEXT PANEL AND ARE ARE CHEAP DEPUTY PRINTED IT DA STEPHANIE CRACKS IN IS ALSO OF IF YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT OUR PLANS AROUND CONTINUITY LEARN BUT WE KNOW THAT WE ASSESS THE NEED WILL PUT A BIT IN SOME WORK FOR ALL STUDENTS FOR. OUR SHEET IN GAS THAT EXISTS HOW WE TOLERATE LEARNING SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS GOING FORWARD WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING A DIFFERENT WAY WE HAVE TO MEASURE LEARNING IN DIFFERENT WAYS. WE CAN'T JUST SPOKE ON THE MATTER OF TIME. THAT SOMEONE IS IN IT IN A DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL EVEN SIT IN SEAT TIME. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT DISTANCE LEARNING MEANS THAT STUDENTS GET ACCESS TO LIVE INSTRUCTION. AS WELL AS TO INSTRUCTION THAT COULD BE DIRECTED TO A WEBSITE. AND THEY'RE GONNA HELP TO CREATE SOME PRACTICES SOME BEST PRACTICES. AROUND HOW THAT DISTANCE LEARNING- GETS DELIVERED AND AS YOU INDICATED CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. SO OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE TOOLS TO CONNECT THEM TO THEIR EDUCATORS AND HAD THE MOST SUCCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE IN THE NEXT WITH THE NEXT PANEL AS WELL THANK YOU. MY BIGGEST REGRET A LOT OF OTHER. MANY MEMBERS MUCH COMMENT SAYING THEN. MISS SMITH COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER SUPERINTENDENT FOR JOINING US TODAY I KNOW YOU AND I SHARE A BACKGROUND OF HAVING SERVED ON A SCHOOL BOARD AND- NOT. HAVING TO MAKE DECISIONS NEARLY AS CHALLENGING AS THE ONES THAT ARE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES NOW FACE. I SAW PICULET CONCERN ABOUT THE ON GOING ISSUE A LIABILITY ON AND I THINK WELL WE HAD VERY ROBUST CONVERSATIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL ABOUT PROVIDING GUIDANCE. TO THE BEST THAT WE CAN IN A CHANGING INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. COULD YOU SPEAK TO WHAT ELSE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO. MY TO DO HELP ASSURE THESE ELLIE A IS THAT THE DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE MAKING ARE GOING TO BE BACKED UP AND OUT WHAT LEVEL. IF THE CD AND THE STATE LEVEL GUIDANCE IS ADVISORY AND WHAT THEY'RE ALSO OVERLAYING WITH THAT IS INFORMATION FROM THE- STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WHAT POINT DO WE ASK THEM TO. INDICATE THAT RISK YOU KNOW THIS IS IT IS AN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING TIME ALL OF THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT A DONE A REALLY ROBUST JOB OF ENGAGING PARENTS THEY'VE DONE PARENTS SURVEYS AND THE RESULTS ARE MIXED YOU KNOW TO THE POINT THAT MS GREEN REYES PARENTS ARE ALL IN VERY DIFFERENT PLACES SUMMER UNIQUELY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH. STILL BACK TO CLASSROOMS SUMMER NOT COMFORTABLE WITH STUDENTS ATTENDING WITH FACE COVERINGS SOME WOULD RATHER YOU KNOW THEIR CHILD CONTINUE TO HAVE ONLY AN ONLINE EARNING A LEARNING OPTIONS I WOULD RATHER HAVE THEIR CHILD BACK IN CLASS FULL TIME- IN THE DAYTIME LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND GIVEN ALL OF THOSE CONSTRAINTS WHAT PARENT COMMUNITIES ARE EXPECTING. AND GUIDANCE TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY I REALLYAM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT LIABILITY FOR DISTRICTS AND IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO EITHER AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL OR HOW WE CAN ASSIST YOU WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO KIND OF MITIGATE THAT TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE I'D APPRECIATE THAT. REMEMBER SMITH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YOU KNOW I COME TO YOU AS A PUBLIC SERVANT LIKE YOU SOMEONE WHO'S WORKING EDUCATION- I I'M I'M NOT- YOU KNOW I DON'T WORK IN THE RISK POOL SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT THE LIABILITY FOLKS SAY- BUT I DO KNOW. THAT THIS GUIDANCE SPEAKS TO THE MOST. SAFE WAYS. THAT WE CAN SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS RETURNED TO CAMPUS. BASED ON THE SCIENCE THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT AND AS NEEDED CHANGE IT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME. EDUCATION LEADERS WHO BEGUN THE CONVERSATION TO LOOK AT. QUESTIONS AROUND A RISK MANAGEMENT. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO CONNECT YOU IN ANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. WHO ARE INTERESTED IN JOINING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THERE ARE OTHER AGENCIES THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK TO THOSE AND WE WANT TO ENGAGE THEM WILL BE CONVENING THEM. IN CONVERSATION. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WARRANTS A QUESTION. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE FEARS WHEN THE WHEN THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SAID THAT WE COULD PROVIDE. AS A NATION DISTANCE LEARNING TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS ABOUT LIABILITY SO MUCH SO THAT SOME OF THAT. VISION TO DO IT. DIRECT WOULD NOT ADVISE THAT. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND WE WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS NOT THE DIRECTION TO GO WE THINK IT'S BETTER TO ASK THE QUESTIONS TO FACE THEM HEAD ON TOGETHER BUT TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE AND MOST SAFETYTHAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR STUDENTS IN THE BEST QUALITY EDUCATION WE'RE HAPPY TO CONNECT YOU TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT- BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE WILL CONTINUE. TO UPDATE OUR GUIDANCE THE BEST INFORMATION WE HAVE BASED ON SCIENCE AND HEALTH STANDARDS ABOUT HOW WE CAN BEST KEEP OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF SAFE WHEN OUR SCHOOLS WE OPEN. IN THE FALL. THANK YOU MISTER SUPERINTENDENT MISTER CHAIR IF I MIGHT I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION FOR DOCTOR MCNAMARA. THANK YOU DOCTOR MCNAMARA- I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER AND I KNOW WHILE WE'RE- ALL TENTATIVELY EXCITED THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS ABLE TO PASS A BUDGET THAT DID NOT HAVE- EXTREME CUTS. TO EDUCATION WE ALL KNOW THAT EDUCATION HAS NOT BEEN FULLY RESTORED TO WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN- PRE RECESSION IN THE CUTS WE ALSO STAND FOR THOSE NUMBER OF YEARS SO WE- ALREADY WERE STILL OPERATING AT A DEFICIT AND STILL ONE OF THE- LOWEST. OF PER PUPIL FUNDED STATES IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS NOT GONE AWAY NOW WE JUST FACES GREATER CHALLENGE. SO IT TO YOU AND PERHAPS AND TO THE MEMBERS OF ACCESS. HAVE THERE BEEN MODELS DEVELOPED ON WHAT AN ADDITION WELL INVESTMENT TAKE TO ADEQUATELY MEET. THE CHALLENGES IN THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE BEING PLACED IN FRONT OF. BJ'S NOW FOR. IF YOU IN INDIA GO AS- HOW MUCH A DISH. CLASSIFIED STAFF YOU WOULD NEED- SUPPORT FOR THE CLEANING AND FOR THE MOVEMENT OF CHILDREN IN AND OUT OF THESE ADOPTED LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. WELL I CAN SPEAK FOR MY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR IN GREAT DETAIL- WE RUN ABOUT A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET AND WE HAVE BEEN DEFICIT SPENDING ACROSS YEARS. AND SUFFERING FROM DECLINING ENROLMENT SO WHAT MAKES THAT INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING. IS THAT THERE IS A THERE'S OFTEN A SENSE IN A BROADER RANGE OF CIRCLES. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN RESTORED AND WELL FUNDED- BUT WHAT IT ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE IN MY ENVIRONMENT IS THAT I HAVE. BEEN REALLY SUFFERING JUST TO KEEP UP- EVERY YEAR WE'VE BEEN DEFICIT SPENDING AND REDUCING OUR ENDING FUND BALANCE ANNUALLY- SO THE CHALLENGES I FACE AS A RESULT OF HAVING FEWER STUDENTS- AND RIGHT SIZING THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR- COMBINED. WITH RISING COSTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RISING COSTS IN PERSON STIRS FUNDING THAT WE HAVE TO DO IT FEELS THAT WE HAVE JUST BARELY BEEN ABLE TO TREAD WATER. AND IN MY CASE WE HAVE- MOVED FROM POSITIVE TO A QUALIFIED BUDGET WHICH IS VERY CONCERNING. AND THAT WAS BEFORE THIS PARTICULAR PANDEMIC- SO NOW I AM VERY WORRIED THAT I'M FACING- TRACK YOUR RIGHT AS MY BUDGET AT THE SAME TIME I'M TRYING TO REALLY ADD- WITH IT NEEDS THAT WE HAVE. I KNOW THAT YOU DISTRICT DOES NOT REPRESENT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS- BUT I DO KNOW THAT MONEY FEELS INCREDIBLY CONSTRAINED- AS IT IS AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE JUST ONE MORE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I MEAN I FIND THE MONEY KIND OF SIT. AND THAT IS LIKELY JUST A GETS TOLL IN THE PERSON THAT WE HAVE SINCE THE BUDGET ARE. FIVE PER TO. NOW THANK. THANK YOU MISS SMITH STONE GIVE US ABOUT. SHOULD BE READ. THIS IS NOT WORKING WITH FROM. TRY AGAIN. THE TOPIC. IT IS ON SO. TRY TRY THAT ONE. THE SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN I HAVE A QUESTION. CAN A- HI SO I THINK YOU HIM SO MY NUMBER THE FACT THAT HE'S CONVENE WITH SEVEN OF MICE SUPERINTENDENTS FROM MY COUNTY SAN WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT MODOC COUNTY. BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CASES ZERO CASES IN MODOC COUNTY. SO THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO PLANS THAT THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER. AND I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS WILL SIGN ONE. WILL BE THEY WILL SIGN OFF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER OR WILL YOUR OFFICE SIGN OFF BECAUSE IN A LOT OF IS SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE FIFTEEN STUDENTS PER CLASSROOM NOW. AND WHAT IS IT WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE FOR THE MORE RULE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO. SOME OF OUR KIDS. ARE NOT BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR PHYSICALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT COMING TO SCHOOL AND WE DON'T HAVE EYES ON THEM. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS IN REGARDS TO PARTNERING POSSIBLY WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OR- HOW DID START TO DO SOME. YOU KNOW WELL CHILD CHECK. IN THOSE REMOTE AREAS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT KIDS AREN'T BEING ACCOUNTED FOR. SEVEN DOLLY WE'RE HAPPY TO ADDRESS FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR SETTING UP THE MEETING WITH THE SUPERINTENDENTS IN YOUR ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION AS IT RELATES TO STUDENTS THAT YOU MENTION WHO'VE NOT CHECKED IN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN ONGOING SO WHY I'D GET IN THE COALITION OF COUNSELING GROUP SCHOOL COUNCIL SCHOOL I CALL JUST ASK SOCIAL IS ANOTHER'S THE- WORK TO GET. THERE WITH YOU IT IS IN YOUR- DID YOU OUT REACHES. WHO HAVE NOT YET CHECKED IN YET MAYBE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR BASIC NEEDS MOVE IT HAD TO MOVE DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE OFF LINE. ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS TO SUPPORT THOSE PARTICULAR STUDENTS. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT YOU HAVE A GREAT CAP FOR INTENDED- IN IT KNOW THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT DYNAMICS IN. THE IN IN MODOC COUNTY AND IN OTHER PLACES- BUT WHAT I. ABOUT YOUR CASE YOU PRINT. THE LOCAL. IT'S A THAT. DAY MAINLY. CASE WITH US. THEY RECKON. THAT THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF NEEDS LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE. AND WE'VE BEEN A REALLY GOOD COMMUNICATION. AT THE END OF THE DAY THE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER IN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT WILL WORK TOGETHER- AROUND COMMUNICATE. PLANS FOR WHAT RE OPENING WILL LOOK LIKE EVERYONE OF OUR ONE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT THE TIMING. ABOUT WHEN IT WILL BE OPEN. MANNER IN THE FIELD TO DO THAT BUT WE TRY TO DO IS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TECHNICAL SUPPORT. GUIDED IN QUESTIONS. WHAT DO QUESTIONS ON HOW THAT RE OPENING CAN ASAP AND THE MOST STIFF CONNECTIONS WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR TEAM. ON HOW THAT HAPPENS IN MODOC ME ARE AGAIN. IN YOUR FAMILY DID. AND THE FORWARD TO BEING IN TOUCH WITH YOU OFF LINE. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISSED ALL THAT IS A REAL CHAU FACE. OR TALK ABOUT CONNECTIVITY THEY'RE CERTAINLY HAVING THE DEVICE CERTAINLY HAVING A HOT SPOT OR SOMETHING TO. CONNECT THE DEVICE WITH THERE'S ALSO GETTING KIDS TO CHECK AND GETTING HIS TO RE ENGAGE IN SCHOOLS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT- TO. SOME OF THE TEACHERS I KNOW SO THAT AS MANY AS 60% PLUS OTHER STUDENTS HAVE NOT CHECKED BACK IN. IT THAT THEIR BEAGLE OUT. RIGHT RIGHT A- AND MARTIN SAID HEY I'M GONNA BE NO MATTER WHAT NOW YEAH I MADE IT BACK. OR ANOTHER SO TO IRAQ IN THE WE DON'T. SAID OTHERS ARE ALL.

WHICH SETS GENERALLY THE POLICIES FOR THE- FOR SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE GOOD TO SEE YOU A DOCTOR AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SURE O'DONNELL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE PART OF THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. AS THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO RE OPEN SCHOOLS IT'S CLEAR THAT PICKING UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF AND RETURNING TO BUSINESS AS USUAL. IT WILL WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE WILL NEED TO ADDRESS THE DEEP SEEDED INEQUALITIES THAT LONG PLAGUED EDUCATION IN THE STAE. I WILL ALSO NEED TO THINK OF SCHOOL IN DEEPLY DIFFERENT WAYS. TEACHING AND LEARNING WILL HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN WAYS THAT ARE GOVERNED BY PURPOSE NOT BY PLACE. AND WE WILL SEE A WIDE RANGE OF ARRANGEMENTS FOR HOW ADULTS AND CHILDREN WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER SOMETIMES A BRICK AND MORTAR CLASSROOMS. AND OTHER TIMES ACROSS CYBERSPACE IN VARIOUS FORMS OF DISTANCE LEARNING. I'LL EMPHASISE FOR THINGS IN MY TESTIMONY TODAY WHICH ARE- ELABORATED IN MORE DETAIL IN MY WRITTEN STATEMENT. OF THAT TEACHING AND LEARNING SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO BE CONTINUOUS AND SUPPORTED BY TECHNOLOGY. AUTHENTIC AND FOCUSED ON LEARNING BURN. IN ARMED USEFUL FOR US. AND IT. WELL AND I KNOW. THESE DAYS OUTLINED IN A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA WERE TO BE BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE STATE BOARD AND THE C. C. E. TO PROVIDE FURTHER GUARDED GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT TO LOCAL DISTRICTS. FIRST CONTINUOUS TEACHING AND LEARNING SUPPORTER BY TECHNOLOGY IN THE RIGHT WAYS. IT'S CLEAR THAT TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTED LEARNING WILL BE PART OF OUR EDUCATIONAL FUTURE AND THAT ALL CHILDREN MUST BE PROVIDED WITH ACCESS. AFTER SCHOOLS RE OPEN THEY WILL LIKELY CLOSE AGAIN FOR PERIODS OF TIME NEXT YEAR ONE INFECTION RATES FULLER. SOME SCHOOLS MAY REOPEN WITH SCHEDULES THE BLIND DISTANCE LEARNING WAS SOCIAL DISTANCING ONSITE. SOMETIMES FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE THE YOUNGER CHILDREN MAY BE IN SCHOOL FULL TIME OLDER ONES ARE STILL LEARNING HOME. ANY INTEREST ON. TIMES FOR THE SAY GROUPS OF CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE IN SCHOOL LEARNING ON MONDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS WITH DISTANCE LEARNING ON TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS EVEN ONE SCHOOLS REOPENED CHILDREN WILL NEED TO STAY HOME IF THEY ARE OTHERS THEIR HOUSEHOLD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS SO THEY'LL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PLUG INTO JUSTIN'S FLOORING AT ANY TIME AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT I'VE DONE STUDIES INTERNATIONALLY OF RE OPENING SCHOOLS AROUND THE WORLD AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TESTING TRACKING AND QUARANTINING. IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS THE JUSTIN SAYING AND USE OF MASKS- IN ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE EXPERIENCE IN FRANCE RECENTLY WHERE THEY- USE ALL OF THE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND ALL THE REST OF IT BUT WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF OPENING SCHOOL THEY HAD TO CLOSE SCHOOLS AGAIN. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE TESTING TRACKING AND QUARANTINING IN PLACE AND THEY HAD SEVENTY CASES POP UP WITHIN A FEW DAYS. THIS MEANS THAT EACH DISTRICT SHOULD HAVE AN INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY PLAN FOR SEAMLESS CUT NEW CONTINUITY OF THE CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION WHEREVER STUDENTS ARE LOCATED. INCLUDING PLANS FOR HOW ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WELL ACCESS LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. THE NUMBER OF COUNTY OFFICES AND DISTRICTS OF ALREADY DONE THE SECOND AS MODELS FOR UP. SHOULD BE A NEXT. OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE ALLOCATED FOR LEARNING LOS IF WE ARE TO AVOID FURTHER EXACERBATING DISRUPTIONS. THE ONLY TO THOSE POTENTIAL LOSSES OF LEARNING TIME. THERE ARE MANY STRONG CURRICULAR MODELS INCLUDING STRATEGIES FOR SERVING ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. DEVELOPED BY DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES THAT WE WILL CERTAINLY MAKE AVAILABLE. IN GUIDANCE AND TOOL KITS FOR DISTANCE AND WANTED LEARNING. THE REALITIES OF THESE COMING MONTHS ALSO MEAN WE MUST CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- AS A SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND NOTED. THERE WERE MORE THAN A MILLION STUDENTS ON ACTIVE WHEN THE PANDEMIC BEGAN WE'VE CLOSE THIS DIVIDE. BY MORE THAN HAPPY. BUT AT LEAST HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE STILL ON. BUT IT WOULD COST HELP US THAN 10% OF THE MONEY WE EXPECT TO ALLOCATE TO SCHOOLS. FROM THE FEDERAL ANSWERS FUNDS AND IN MY VIEW IT SHOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY IN OUR FIRST USE OF THE FUNDS. THE TECHNOLOGY TOLD ME TO BE IS NOT TO REPLACE TEACHERS BUT TO ENABLE. HIS FACE TO FACE LIVE CONNECTIONS WHICH GIVES AND- WHEN NOT CLASSROOM TOGETHER. AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS NECESSARY TOOLS FOR LEARNING- AND TO PROVIDE FAMILIES THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS TELL HEALTH. BENEFITS AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT THE DISPARATE HEALTH EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS OF COVER NINETEEN. ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ARE DEEPLY EXACERBATED BY OUR FAILURE TO TAKE CARE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WHICH SHIP IN A RADIC HATED YEARS AGO AND MUST BE ERADICATED NOW. THE SAME AS FACED TO FACE INTERACTIONS. TO ESTABLISH HUMAN CONTACT TO ALLOW CHILDREN TO BE A DISCUSSION WITH THEIR TEACHERS AND PEERS. TO PROVIDE A TRUE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR DEMONSTRATING IDEAS CHECKING FOR UNDERSTANDING AND SEEING HOW CHILDREN ARE THINKING AND WHAT THEY UNDERSTAND. WHEN THIS IS LEARNING IS NECESSARY THEY SHOULD BE A DAILY EXPECTATIONS. FOR AT LEAST ONE HOUR A DAY AND THEN MANY OF COMMUNITIES TODAY- DEPENDING ON THE AGE LEVEL OF THE STUDENTS IS FROM ONE TO FOUR HOURS A DAY. I WHETHER IT'S FOR ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM MEETINGS AND STORY TIME OR FOR DEBATES AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT LITERATURE HISTORY AND PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS. MANY CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS OF ALREADY. SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES LIKE THIS USING A RANGE OF WEB BASED TOOLS WITH HIGH ENGAGEMENT OF STUDENTS AND THEY'RE INNOVATING IN CREATIVE WAYS. IN ADDITION TO THEIR WELL DESIGNED CURRICULUM LONG BEACH HAS EVEN FIGURED OUT HOW TO HAVE TEACHERS WHO ARE EXPERTS. IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE CURRICULUM TEACHER ONLINE TO ANY STUDENTS WHO WANT TO ENGAGE A PARTICULAR TOPIC. AS TO ANY TEACHERS WHO WANT TO LEARN STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING AT. MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS AND MANY TEACHERS ARE TUNING IN FOR SOME OF SESSIONS. WHICH ARE LINKED TO SPECIFIC CURRICULUM REELS OF. IN THE DISTRICT. MORE TEACHERS WILL BE ENTERING GAME IN THESE TECH SUPPORTER DEMO. LESSONS WHEN SCHOOL BACK IN SESSION SO THE THEY CAN OFFER. PATIENTS TECHNOLOGIES ORDER THEN INCOME. QUESTION WELL TAKING. OF THE ARE. TO USE A BILL T. X. AND STUDENTS. TO LAW. THE SEVEN POINT TO MAKE IS THAT OFFENSE X. INST. THAT IT WAS TEACHES STUDENTS TO LEARN. IS THE- DURING THESE LAW FEW THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE SIX. MOTIVE STE DOING IN WAR. EVEN MORE GOING HAS BEEN DISRUPT. AND EVEN IN VERY HIGH NEED TO. HAVE HAD A PLAN FOR CONTINUOUS INSTRUCTION A LONG RUNNING CONTINUUM EACH CONTENT AREA AND THEY'VE BEEN CONNECTING LESSONS TO REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS. TEACHING STUDENTS THE SKILLS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BECOME INDEPENDENT LEARNING. THROUGH A SKILL FOR BLEND OF SYNCHRONOUS APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING IDEAS FOLLOWING UP ON EIGHTEEN FOR THIS TIME TO ENGAGE IN INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE RESEARCH PROBLEM SOLVING A WRITING. WITH TEACHER CHECK INS PROJECT BASED IMPROV PROBLEM BASED LEARNING APPROACHES HAVE BEEN FLOURISHING IN DISTRICTS RANGING FROM SAN DIEGO FOR TEN IN ANAHEIM TO LOOK BUSY RICHMAN AND UPLAND. AND MANY MANY. OTHERS WHEN SCHOOL RESUMES THI OF WORK SHOULD CONTINUE IT IS. ADAPT TO BLUNDER LEARNING MODELS SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAS DEVELOPED A SET OF MODULES ORGANIZING THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS FOR DISTANCE A BLENDED LEARNING. GROUNDING IN A PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS THAT STUDENTS COMPLETE AS PART OF THEIR WORK. THE STATE CAN PLAY A ROLE IN CURATING PEDAGOGICAL RESOURCES FOR THIS KIND OF LEARNING TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SKILLS. ACROSS SUBJECT AREAS AND STUDENT GROUPS INCLUDING ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DIFFERENCES. ENSURING THAT THESE PEDAGOGIES ARE USED TO TEACH STUDENTS COGNITIVE STRATEGIES THAT ENABLE THEM TO BECOME A SELF GUIDED AN INDEPENDENT LEARNERS. AND IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY OR PROVIDE A NUMBER OF OTHER RESOURCES FOR THIS KIND OF WORK. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT TEACHING STUDENTS HOW THEIR STRATEGIES ABOUT HOW TO LEARN PAYS OFF A SPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND MEANINGFUL APPLICATIONS OF WEARING THEIR REQUIRE ORAL AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATION STRENGTH IN ENGLISH LEARNERS PROFICIENCIES. IN ADDITION TO SKILLFUL TEACHING A REGULAR AND BLENDED CLASSROOM SETTING% SCHOOLS WILL WANT TO EXPLORE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY INCLUDE INTENSIVE LITERACY OR MATH INSTRUCTION AND SMALL GROUPS. WITHIN MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT AND WITH AN EXPANDED LEARNING TIME THAT MAY BE CREATED BY SUMMER SCHOOL ADDITIONAL TIME AFTER SCHOOL ARE RETHINKINGSCHEDULES THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR. AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES WE CAN MAKE AVAILABLE THAT CAN BE USED TO A SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION TO EFFECTIVELY PRODUCE LEARNING GAINS THAT WE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SUPPORT WHAT THE FUNDS THAT ARE SPENT ON LEARNING LOS. THIRD FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS THAT SUPPORT GROWTH. RATHER THAN- OF LEAVING IT TO CHANCE ARE WE NEED TO USE THOUGHTFUL DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS TO EVALUATE WHAT STUDENTS KNOW REMEMBER AND ARE READY TO LEARN NEXT. OF THESE ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE STANDARDIZED TESTS THAT ARE WIDELY USED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. CALIFORNIA HAS APPROVED A SET OF DIAGNOSTIC AND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH COMMON CORE STANDARDS THAT OFFER TOOLS FOR ASSESSMENT. IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH ALONG THE GREAT SPEND CONTINUING FROM K. TWELVE WE WILL SOON BE ISSUING GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF THESE ASSESSMENTS. TO SUPPORT AN INFORMAL LEARNING. UP WE ARE ALSO FORTUNATE AS A STATE TO HAVE THE ASSETS OF THE SMARTER BALANCED CONSORTIUM- THEIR INTEREST MONTHS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY EXPANDED. SO THEY CAN BE USED IN DEMISE GLAZER PRETTY AREAS OF THE CURRICULUM OR AS A FULL FLEDGED ASSESSMENT. AND DESTRUCTION AND NAPA FOR HOW TO USE THESE TOOLS TO THAT CONSTRUCTION FALL. NOTED ABOUT HOW TO USE THESE TO. WILL BE A- I KEEP MY- IS THE- IN THE WE NOT IDENTIFY. STUDENTS AND LOW THEM OF FOR DIFFERENT AND THAT IS I IN A WAY THAT STATEMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE ONE THE ONE STUDENTS TAKE ONE STIGMATIZING LABELS- AND ARE RELEGATED TO SORT OF TEST PREP INSTRUCTION THEIR ACHIEVEMENT ULTIMATELY IS LESS THAN WHAT THE TEACHERS CAN PINPOINT EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO NEXT. GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY SOARED THAT SKILL WITH FEEDBACK AND CONTINUALLY ITERATE AROUND MOVING THEM FORWARD IN A LEARN PROGRESSION AND FINALLY WE NEED TO INTEGRATE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ENACT LEARNING ONCE THE BILL HAS RE OPENED THE TO TAKES. THE SOCIAL MOST. I THIS IS A MORNING WE THAT WELL AS IMPACTS LEARNING THESE AFFECT CAN BE. BY STRAW TRUST YOUR- AND OP TO DEVELOP SOCIAL ABOUT LEARNING SKILLS. RECOGNIZE ND TALK ABOUT THE X. THAT EMOTION. LEARNING STE FOR CA ONCE AND SOLVING ACCESS HEALTH. AND MY HEALTH RESOURCES. LIKE MINNESOTA AND A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA SHOULD PROVIDE REGULAR RESOURCES. ELEMENTS OF. FOR A TO THE SKILLS AND SAYS WORKS. AS WELL AS CO WE AND REFERENCE. THAT ENABLE STUDENTS TO COPE WITH THE MANY CHALLENGES THEY ARE EXPERIENCING. WE SHOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO CREATE MORE RELATION BASED- STRUCTURES LIKE LOOPING AND ADVISORY SYSTEMS SCHOOLS THAT HAVE DONE THIS ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER SUCCESS WAS STUDENTS WERE OF A WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS. AND IT IS IMPORTANT- THAT WE CREATE THE STRUCTURES WITHIN WHICH TEACHERS CAN CARE OF ACTIVELY FOR THE STUDENTS. FOR ALL THE WORK RESCUE OUR SCHOOLS TODAY RESOURCES ARE CURRENT RISK YOUR AND WE WILL NEED IS THE MORE EYES. AS AS IT WILL SET ASIDE FUNDING FOR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AS THE PHONE FUNDING MASTER IN VERY SICK HOPEFUL TO HEAR THAT ARRIVE. WE SHOULD PRESS. OR FOR FAMILY EDUCATION. FOR LEARNING THE WRIST VERSUS FOR. LEARNING THESE TO CONTINUE AS TACKLE NOTES I'M TO ANSWER FOR THE QUESTIONS. SEE WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE NEVER DONE THAT RIGHT SO THANK YOU ARE WITH THAT- WE'RE GOING TO DO IT GO TO JAMIE ONLY A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER- FROM THE EMPIRE UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT WHO IS REPRESENTING THE EQUITY COALITION- WITH US TODAY MISS ONLY A FEW OF SHE'S HERE ACTUALLY SHE WAS GOING TO YOUR CONVERTS. BUT SHE IS HERE YEAH ANIMALS SURE A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER MAY PROCEED ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. O'DONNELL IN MEMBERS. I AM JAMIE ONLY A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER. IN A SMALL CENTRAL VALLEY DISTRICT AND A TEACH PLUS POLICY FELLOW. I'M ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE EQUITY COALITION. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SHARE MY STUDENTS EXPERIENCES DURING COVERT NINETEEN. THE STATE KNOWS THEM AS WAS LEARNERS. AND SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. I KNOW THEM AS CLAUDIA. YOU'RE RIGHT THOUGH. AND THE WEEKS. I'M HERE TO ENSURE THAT THEY DO NOT BECOME ANOTHER STATISTIC. IN A CONTRIBUTOR TO THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. OR TO REMAIN INVISIBLE. I TEACH ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT TITLE ONE SCHOOL. POVERTY LINE. THE MOST. G. FOR BY IN THE HOME. CHILDREN WHO WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. I LONG TERM ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS WHO COME TO ME AFTER MULTIPLE YEARS OF HAVING BEEN FELLED BY A PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. WHEN SCHOOL IS CLOSED COMMENT FROM MY STUDENTS TO WATCH YOUNGER SIBLINGS WHILE THE PARENTS WORK MULTIPLE JOBS. NEVER THE LESS THEY ARE RESILIENT. HARD WORKING AND HUNGRY TO LEARN. MY STUDENTS FIGHT A SILENT BATTLE AGAINST INEQUITY EVERY DAY DISTANCE LEARNING HAS MADE THIS BATTLE SO MUCH HARDER. SCHOOL CLOSED IN MARCH 60% OF MY STUDENTS IMMEDIATELY DROPPED OFF THE RADAR MY DISTRICT REQUIRE TEACHERS TO PROVIDE PACKETS FROM MARCH TO ME. TEACHERS ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO POST ASSIGNMENTS ELECTRONICALLY IN ADDITION I CALLED MESSAGE STUDENTS CONSTANTLY AND DROP A BOOKS ON THE PORCHES I EVEN ROWS WHAT DO LOUIS THEM SLEEP AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON TO TALK TO HIM THROUGH A WINDOW. I WAS SURPRISED THAT CLAUDIA A TALKATIVE AND ENGAGE STUDENT IN MY CLASS STILL HAD MEMBERS RESPONDED TO ME DESPITE MY MULTIPLE VOICE MAILS AND HARASSING LOOKING AT. SUPPORT OF MESSAGES WHEN SHE FINALLY ANSWERED THE PHONE SHE SHARED THAT SHE HAD NEITHER ACCESS TO A DEVICE NOR WIFI AT THE BEGINNING OF MAY REMOTE INSTRUCTION BEGAN IN MY DISTRICT FAMILIES COULD PICK UP ONE DEVICE FOR FAMILY FROM SCHOOL SITES. IMPOSSIBLE FOR CLAUDIA BECAUSE HER MOM AND SISTER WORK TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS IN A PACKING PLANT AND SHE CARES FOR HER BABY NIECE. SHE SAID. I HEARD A RUMOR FROM SOME FRIENDS THAT THERE WAS SCHOOL BUT I WASN'T SURE I COULD PARTICIPATE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY BOOK OR WIFI. AM I GOING TO GET ENOUGH. THAT SAME EVENING I DROVE TO HER TRAILER PARK- WITH A SCHOOL LAPTOP AND FREE INTERNET PROVIDERS FLYERS TRANSLATED IN SCHOOL. IN SPANISH. WHEN I FOLLOWED UP WITH CLAUDIA LATER THAT WEEK HER MOTHER WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE INFORMATION AND HAD STILL NOT SET UP THE FREE WIFI SERVICE. I TO CALL MYSELF AND I WAS NEVER EVER ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE HUMAN BEING. FORGET THE RIGHT HELP DESPITE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. IMAGINE WHAT THIS EXPERIENCE WAS LIKE FOR CLAUDIA'S MOTHER. OTHER PARENTS WHO HAVE LOST JOBS DUE TO KOBE NINETEEN WERE DENIED FREE INTERNET ACCESS BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ACCOUNT WELL OTHERS LOST PHONE SERVICE. CLAUDIA SPENT MUCH OF HER CHILDHOOD HIDING IN A HOUSE- HOUSE IN MEXICO WHERE CARTEL GUN BATTLES RAGED OUTSIDE. SHE WANTS TO SPARE OTHERS FROM GOING THROUGH THE SAME **** MY GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE WITH A CRIMINOLOGY DEGREE AND BECOMING A DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENTS. BEFORE MARCH CLAUDIA WAS WRITING FIVE PARAGRAPH ESSAYS NOW. SHE CAN ONLY SPEAK IN HALTING ENGLISH. THERE WILL BE NO SUMMER SCHOOL. CLAUDIO INTO MY CLASSROOM IN AUGUST HAVING NOT HEARD. SPOKEN RED WRITTEN ENGLISH FOR FIVE MONTHS. UNFORTUNATELY HER EXPERIENCE IS FAR TOO COMMON STUDENTS LIKE CLAUDIA NEED AND DESERVE SO MUCH MORE THAN THE CRISIS SCHOOLING THEY'VE RECEIVED SINCE MARCH. ACCESS TO QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY IN EVEN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE NEED LEADERSHIP FROM THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT WE DO BETTER MOVING FORWARD AND PUT NECESSARY SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE SO THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS GET ACCESS TO INSTRUCTION. OBJECTIVE ACCOMMODATION. AND SUPPORT WE URGE POLICYMAKERS TO ACT INTENTIONALLY LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF EDUCATORS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMEND THIS STATE CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY AS WE RETURN TO SCHOOL WE MUST REQUIRE DELAYS TO ADOPT PLANS THAT EVALUATE ALL STUDENTS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH LEARNING LASSEN TRAUMA THEY EXPERIENCED DURING SCHOOL CLOSURES. INSURE A FULL CURRICULUM OF SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR QUALITY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IN SCHOOL OR BY DISTANCE LEARNING WITH ACCOMMODATIONS FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. AND STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY BEHIND. JACK STUDENTS ATTENDANCE AND LEVEL OF EDUCATE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT IN EDUCATION DALY. PROVIDE LIVE OR SYNCHRONOUS DISTANCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES BETWEEN TEACHERS AND ALL STUDENTS. FINALLY HELP FAMILIES TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN IN DISTANCE LEARNING IN THE LANGUAGES THAT THEIR PARENTS SPEAK. I'M ASKING YOU TO GIVE CLAUDIA AN OPPORTUNITY. TO LEARN TO USE OUR PASSION AND SKILLS TO IMPACT THE WORLD TO BE SEEN AS AN ASSET NOT A DEFICIT. TO LIVE A LIFE OF FREEDOM. RATHER ONE SPENT IN CAPTIVITY YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP OUR ENGLISH ENGLISH LEARNERS NOT ONLY ACCLIMATE BUT TO EXCEL AND BECOME CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY YOU WILL BE THE CHAMPIONS OF CHANGE BY ENSURING ALL STUDENTS ARE GUARANTEED THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS OF A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR- YOUR TESTIMONY A VERY REAL WORLD NO DOUBT SO THANK YOU WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS FROM A LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I BELIEVE SHE IS THAT SHE CHIEF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OFFICER. MAKE CORRECT ENTITLED VERIFY OF THE CROWD AND CRACKED- HER NAME IS ALLISON YOSHIMOTO TOWERING AND AGAIN SHE IS WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY YOU'RE KIDDING. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL. SENATOR LEYVA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING. MY NAME IS ALLISON YOSHIMOTO TERRY THE CHIEF ACADEMIC OFFICER OF THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SHARE THE SPENDING ABOUT THE DISTRICTS EFFORTS TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. UP UNTIL THREE MONTHS AGO STUDENTS ENTERED SCHOOL GROUNDS. HAND IN HAND LAUGHING ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER GREETING THEIR FRIENDS. AND FOR THE LAST TWELVE WEEKS THE ONLY WAY A STUDENT COULD GET ACCESS TO LIVE INSTRUCTION. SERVICES AND SUPPORT. LET ALONE THEIR TEACHERS AND THEIR PEERS WAS THROUGH A DEVICE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. IN A BRICK AND MORTAR SETTING WHEN IT CAN A GARDENER TEACHERS THAT KINDERGARTEN TEACHER SAYS ONE TWO THREE EYES ON ME. THAT'S HOW THE ESTABLISH A CONNECTION. IN A DISTANCE LEARNING SETTING THE CONNECTION CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT A DEVICE AND THAT INTERNET IT'S A PORTAL IF YOU WILL. TO THE TEACHER THEIR P. WELL COMMUNITY. WE TOOK BOLD STEPS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT IN LOS ANGELES UNIFIED HAD ACCESS TO COMPUTING DEVICE. PICTURING OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DEVICES.OUR TEAM WORKS TO AUGMENT EACH SCHOOL'S INVENTORY. WE PROVIDED LTE ENABLED THE HOTS L. L. T. E. IN ABLE TO TABLETS AND HOT SPOT. AT NO COST TO OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO NEEDED INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME. IN LATE MAY TWENTY TWENTY WE AMENDED OUR ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WITH VERIZON TO OFFER OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PRICE FOR WIRELESS INTERNET ACCESS SO THAT STUDENTS COULD STAY CONNECTED. TO THEIR SCHOOL FAMILIES. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED HAS SPENT OVER A HUNDRED MILLION TO PAY FOR ALL OF THE DEVICES AND HOT SPOTS. AND WE CALL OF THE STATE TO HELP ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF SUSTAINING THESE EFFORTS GOING FORWARD. NOT INCLUDED IN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS THE CLASS IS THE COST OF FUNDING I HOPE THIS CAUGHT WIND FOR FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS. SIX DAYS A WEEK TWELVE HOURS PER DAY TO ENSURE DEVICES TURN ON HOT SPOTS WORK. STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO GET THEIR USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS ARE Q. R. CODES. AND STUDENTS KNOW HOW TO ACCESS THEIR LEARNING PLATFORM. ALSO NOT INCLUDED IN THE HUNDRED MILLION IS THE COST TO RUN A SECOND HOTLINE TO ENSURE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS. MANY OVERWHELMED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEARNING GAPS WIDENING. AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. ALSO NOT INCLUDED AS THE COULD COST OF PROVIDING QUALITY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO HELP OUR EDUCATORS MASTER DIGITAL CONTENT PEDAGOGY. BASICALLY HOW TO TEACH ONLINE AND TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO SUCCESSFULLY ENSURE LEARNING FROM A DISTANCE. WE ARE INVESTING OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IRAQI FEDERAL CARES ACT DOLLARS DISTRICT IN THE QUALITY OF OUR DISTANCE LEARNING EFFORTS AND TO SUPPORT OUR EDUCATORS DURING THE TRANSITION TO REMOTE TEACHING AND LEARNING. AND NEARLY ALL OF OUR TEACHERS COMPLETED TEN HOURS OF TRAINING. IN THE BASICS OF REMOTE TEACHING. AT APPROXIMATELY 50% MORE SIGNED UP FOR AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY HOURS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND FINALLY NOT INCLUDED IN THAT FIGURE. ARE THE NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE COST NECESSARY FOR DATA SYSTEMS DIGITAL CONTENT AND COMMUNICATION TOOLS. ALL TOGETHER IN LA UNIFIED WE USE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED. INSTRUCTIONAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CLASSROOM DOJO SCHOOLOGY AND ZOOM CURRENTLY BEING USED BY OUR SCHOOLS. AND THE USAGE OF THESE VERY IS MEANINGFUL ACROSS MEANINGFULLY DIFFERENT ACROSS GRADE LEVELS. AND OUR ABILITY TO MEASURE STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND GIVE TEACHERS AND FAMILIES THE ABILITY TO PROGRESS MONITOR STUDENT PARTICIPATION CONTINUES TO BE AN ONGOING CHALLENGE. IN THESE NEW TIMES PROTECTIVE PERSONAL PROTECT PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT LIKE THE ONE THAT KEEPS FALLING OFF MY FACE. CAN HELP KEEP A VIRUS AWAY. AND THE DEVICE INTERNET AND A WELL PREPARED EDUCATOR CAN PROTECT AGAINST A LIFETIME OF A LITERACY INTERVENTION AND RELIANCE AND PUBLIC WELFARE. THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHT EQUITY ISSUE. WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT CONNECTION OVER YEARS AND OVER DECADES. A STUDENT IN EVERY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME BASIC EQUIPMENT JUST AS EVERY STUDENTS ENTITLED TO WALK THROUGH A CLASSROOM DOOR. HAVE A TEXTBOOK. HAVE A SUPPLY BOX OF PENCILS AND CRAYONS. THAT'S HOW BASIC A DEVICE AND INTERNET SHOULD BE AND IF WE TRULY BELIEVE IN EARLY EDUCATION AN INTERGENERATIONAL INTERGENERATIONAL FAMILY ENGAGEMENT THIS OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO PRE K. AND ADULT EDUCATION. TO EQUIP EVERY STUDENT ACROSS THE STATE WITH THE DEVICE AND INTERNET THE ANNUAL COST WOULD BE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLION WE ESTIMATE. AND EVERYTHING ELSE I MENTIONED THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT THE TRAINING THE TOOLS THE TRACKING MEAN FOR OUT PARTICIPATION. WAS WELL BEYOND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE PARTICIPATORY DIVIDE. A LOS FROM ACCESS SIMPLY ACCESS TO HOW TO USE THAT ACCESS TO BE CITY CLEAN GAUGED COLLAGEN CAREER MINDED. AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO AS SUCH. WE URGE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. FOR THE LONG TERM AND FIRST TO SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. SO THAT WE CAN ALL GET BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE PRESENTERS ALL JUST MAKE A FEW COMMENTS- I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AGAIN FOR MISS LINDA. DARLING HAMMOND THE NEED TO LOOK AT LIABILITY AS AN ISSUE I KNOW IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP BY MISS SMITH TO THE OTHER PANEL WITH THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. I KNOW IS- YOU ENGAGE WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH I HOPE YOU YOU BRING THAT UP BECAUSE- YOU HIGHLIGHTED LEARNING WHICH I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. BUT LEARNING CAN HAPPEN IF SCHOOLS ARE GONNA BE OVER RUN WITH LAWSUITS THOUGH THEY WILL FINANCIALLY CRIPPLE. A SCHOOL THE TECHNOLOGY- BROUGHT UP BY A- NUMBER OF PEOPLE TODAY. WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS A CONSISTENT FUNDING SOURCES ONE AND TECHNOLOGY AND THE CONNECTIVITY- WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. I DON'T SEE MUCH. GOING ON THERE. STATEWIDE THEN WE ALSO PASSED A BILL- MAYBE FIVE YEARS AGO OR SO MY BEEN YOUR HUSBAND SO I DON'T KNOW THAT BUT- IT HAD TO DO WITH AN URBAN. AND RURAL. AND URBAN RURAL ACCESS TO GETTING ONLINE WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PROGRAM AND SEE IF IT NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED. SO THEY CAN ADEQUATELY FUND- SUCH AN EFFORT AND I THIN THAT. WE NEED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. TO FUND- TECHNOLOGY AND ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE. SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THIS MISTER ALI HAMID OR ANYONE REALLY ON THE PANEL. THAT'S SPORTS WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK SPORTS WEAVER INCOME PATIENT ASCII. THAT'S NOW SUPPORT PRO. WELL. TE RESTARTED HELD OFF OF WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE SO. DO THEY PRACTICE DO THEY NOT PRACTICE. THAT'S WHERE WE DO NEED SOME CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT PRACTICING AND ANOTHER NOT PRACTICING BECAUSE THAT GETS INTO. SOME OF OUR MORE COMPETITIVENESS ISSUES- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO COMMENT ON JUST SPORTS ALONE OR ANY OF. THE TOPICS I JUST HIGHLIGHTED. THANK YOU. I HATE TO BE THE DISPOSITIVO VOICE ON SPORTS BUT WE DID LOOK AT- INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GONE BACK TO SCHOOL AND- TYPICALLY THEY VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE KIDS TO GO OUTSIDE AND HAVE RECESS PARTICULARLY IN SMALL GROUPS AND TO PLAY- AND NON CONTACT SPORTS ARE TYPICALLY ENCOURAGE BUT CONTACT SPORTS ARE NOT- AND I AM SHAKING IN MY BOOTS TO BE THE ONE TO SAY THAT- BUT IT IS PRETTY CONSTANT ACROSS COUNTRY IS THE OTHER THING. THAT IT IS DID TYPICALLY JUST BRIDGE IS OUR CROSS SCHOOL SPORTS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN TESTING TRACKING AND MANAGING CONTACT. GREAT THANK YOU AS OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE BECAUSE I KNOW IF YOU'RE- GETTING CALLS LIKE I AM FROM SOME OF THE FOLKS OUT THERE THAT IS THAT IS A CONCERN OF PARENTS AND- AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT. WE ALL HAVE AND THAT IS HEALTH CONCERNS- BUT AGAIN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE WITH THAT ARE THERE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT HAVE QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTERS LIKE CHAIR- FIRST I WANT TO THANK MISS ONLY WHAT AN AMAZING TEACHER YOU ARE AND ANY CHILD THAT GOES TO YOUR- CLASSROOM WHETHER IN PURCHASE PERSON OR VIRTUALLY IS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HAVE ONE QUESTION. AND I WILL LET- IS- DARLING HAMMOND OR MS YOSHIMOTO TELL WE DECIDE WHO WANTS TO ANSWER IT. WOULD BE HOUSE- A VERSION OF THE BUDGET OUR VERSION OF THE BUDGET YES IF THE LEGISLATURE DID. WHAT ISSUES RELATED TO RE OPENING THE SCHOOLS WERE NOT ADDRESSED IN THATBUDGET. THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT SURE. I HAVE NOT HAD ENOUGH. PLEASE TELL US WHERE YOU WENT OVER THERE WE GO YOU'RE ON NOW. YOU'RE ON. I'VE HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY REVIEW THE BUDGET- IN ITS COMPLETENESS SO I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE BUT WHEN I SAW AN EARLIER VERSION IT WAS UNCLEAR WHERE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WAS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED- I WILL BE GLAD TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE FULLER ANSWER AFTER REVIEW THE BUDGET. THE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR OTHER QUESTIONS MISS SMITH. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I TO SHARE JUST THAT THE GRATITUDE FOR MISS ONLY- AND YOUR PASSION AS A TEACHER AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR STUDENTS AND THANK YOU FOR THAT EXEMPLARY WORK AND THANK YOU FOR REALLY. VERY CLEARLY PAINTING A PORTRAIT OF JUST HOW STEEP MANY OF THESE BARRIERS ARE THAT OUR OUR STUDENTS FACE DAY IN DAY OUT PANDEMIC NOT WITHSTANDING FOR THOSE CHILDREN THAT YOU TEACH TO JUST TO MAKE IT TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND THEN IN A NORMAL ENVIRONMENT IS A STRETCH AND IN THESE TIMES- AN EXTRAORDINARY STRETCHED I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I THANK YOU FOR DOING EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD. TO CLOSE THAT GAP WE APPRECIATE THAT I'M FOR MS YOSHIMOTO FROM- LA UNIFIED I ALSO APPRECIATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU DELINEATED THE VERY REAL COST OF IMPLEMENTING I DISTANCE LEARNING WHAT SCALE ACROSS THE STATE AND THE BARRIERS THAT STILL EXIST- AND THEN MY QUESTIONS FOR DAR HIM A I. THAT YOU I REALLY HAVE HAVE LEAN INTO THE SIGNIFICANT IN THE CHANGE IN PEDAGOGY AROUND NOW MOTIVATING AND INSTRUCTING STUDENTS TO BE- SELF MOTIVATED AND TO BE DUE TO BE ABLE TO MANEUVER MORSE WRECKED AND LEARNING BUT IT ALSO OCCURS TO ME THAT THAT A MISSING PIECE OF THIS MIGHT BE. THE TEN THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. PARENTS TO ASSIST THIS MOMENT I'M WONDERING IF ANYTHING INTO. FOR THAT WE ABLE TO PUSH OUT. IT STATE WIDE AND PERHAPS EVEN THROUGH SOME OF OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS AND AFFILIATES. TO ENGAGE OUR OUR PARENTS IN THIS PARTNERSHIP. THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD RESOURCES BOTH FOR PARENTS AND FOR EDUCATORS- WITHIN OUR STATE- ONE THAT'S BEING MORE FULLY DEVELOPED AS WIDE OPEN SCHOOL- ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT DISTRICTS TO DO IS DEVELOP IN THESE INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY PLANS. ACCESS OF FOR BOTH PARENTS AND EDUCATORS AND KIDS. TO ALL OF THE MATERIALS THAT WILL BE USED SO THAT THEY CAN TOGETHER- BECAUSE IT NOW IS THAT PARENTS AND- TEACHERS ARE TEACHING KIDS TOGETHER- TOGETHER UNDERSTAND- WHAT'S AVAILABE TO THEM- SO IN THE GUIDANCE THAT IS. BEING DEVELOPED FOR DISTANCE A BLENDED LEARNING WE WILL BE- IDENTIFYING WAYS THAT PARENTS CAN ALSO LEARN HOW TO SUPPORTERS STUDENTS- THERE'S SOME WONDERFUL ITEMS ALSO. OF PERRANCE OF. OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES PARENTS OF STUDENTS AT DIFFERENT AGE LEVELS. AND THE- MATERIALS OFTEN CONNECT WE MAY WANT TO BEGIN TO BE OFFERING. PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO PARENTS TEACHERS GATHER. AT THE SAME IT. THIS IS WHERE ARMENIAN. AND WILL TO CONTINUE IN DISTANCE LEARNING- OR WHERE THERE ARE YOU KNOW KIND OF LONG TERM- POSSIBILITIES THAT THAT WILL BE A MAJOR FORM OF LEARNING SO I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE. THANK YOU. THREE OF MISTER MCCARTY THANK YOU AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING MOST OF THE PRESENTATION AS ONE OF THE FOLLOW UP ON THIS QUESTION THAT CENTER LEYVA APPS BUT MAYBE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN BUDGET. OUR BUDGET- FOR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND WAS ESSENTIALLY THE ONE THAT WE ANNOUNCE TEN DAYS AGO WHICH BASICALLY- WOULD REJECT THE CUTS TO L. CFF IN OUR SCHOOLS AND BASICALLY FULLY FUND OUR SCHOOLS WITH THE ONE TIME MONEY. THAT WE GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- GRANTED WE DO WE HAVE THAT THAT INITIAL WOULD DEFERRALS FOR THE NEXT YEAR BUT FOR THIS YEAR. ROUGHLY KEEP SCHOOL FUNDING WHOLE. SO REALLY THE QUESTION IS YOU YOU SAW WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S NEWLY REVISE I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT DECISION FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE. KIND OF THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS A DIFFERENT JOB. BUT DO YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT IF WE HAD TO ACCEPT WHAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE WHAT'S MY ARE SITTING THERE STILL PUSHING THEIR NEGOTIATIONS TODAY. WHICH IF WE DON'T GET THE FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD HAVE THESE. HUGE CUTS TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT THEY COULD DO. ALL WHICH WE SPENT THE LAST TWO HOURS TALKING ABOUT HE SENSUALLY. SCHOOLS ARE GONNA BE DOING MORE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING LAST WHAT THEY'VE DONE BEFORE. WITH DISTANCE LEARNING WHAT SEPARATION ALL THIS PAST WE'RE ASKING OUR- BY. A TEACHERS TO DO. TO DO REALLY. REALITY IF WE HAD TWO X. WHAT WAS THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE. THAT ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONE THOUSAND OF THEM ACROSS CALIFORNIA. COULD PULL IT OFF AND ACHIEVE WHAT. THE SUPERINTENDENT IN YOU OUTLINED WITH NEEDED TO BE DONE. FOR OUR KIDS THIS COMING YEAR. WELL I THINK EVERYBODY IS VERY ARE PUSHING VERY HARD FOR THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT NEED TO BE THERE AS I UNDERSTOOD THE MAY REVISE IT TRIGGERED BACK IN. AS SOON AS THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS ARRIVED THE- ADDITIONAL- FUNDS NEEDED TO KEEP US WHOLE- I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS WORKING HARD WITH FOLKS IN WASHINGTON TO GET THAT- ADDITIONAL MONEY ALLOCATED. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT EVEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS- THERE ARE GOING TO BE ONGOING CHALLENGES OF SCHOOLS. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE NEEDING TO PLAN FOR RECOVERY ACTS- YOU KNOW. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR- THIS IS A BIGGER- HITS TO. A STATE REVENUES THEN THE GREAT RECESSION WAS- IT'S- A TERRIBLE SITUATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE. FISCALLY SOLVENT AND TO START SCHOOL PLEASE DAYS. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK THAT. UP YEAH DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO BE- IT SINCE. THERE'S GOING TO BE IN IN PLACE IN BROKEN MORTAR. CLASS AND I AM WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE- ORGANIZE BOTH THE DID YOU RESEARCH FOR EVERY SINGLE FEATURING KID. AND WHY WE NEED TO ORGANIZE THE- SCHOOL RESOURCES IN THE SENSE OF INTEGRATED STUDENT SUPPORTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER WE'RE IN R OUT OF BRICK AND MORTAR AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE YEAR. BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET IS TO THE BUDGET QUESTION THAT THAT THE CENTER ASKED TO IS IT IF WE DON'T GET THE FEDERAL FUNDS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD HAVE THESE AUTOMATIC CUTS AND WE WOULD. FIND SCHOOLS AND HAVE TO GO AND GO THROUGH A DEFERRAL SO ESSENTIALLY SCHOOLS WOULD GET FUNDED. IF WE DIDN'T GET THE FEDERAL FUNDS DO YOU THINK THAT THE SCHOOL COULD PULL IT OFF THEN IT CANNOT AND BASICALLY. WHERE ARE CAN ATTEND TRYING HERE. AND WHAT'S TO. IN ABOUT. DISTRICT JULIE IS MORE WHAT THEY CURRENTLY DO AND THEY WILL BEGIN LAST MY SO HOW WOULD THAT WORK IF WE ARE SAID OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. LESS. I THINK THERE IS. NO DOUBT THAT FEWER DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER BRICK AND MORTAR- TEACHING AND LEARNING IN PHYSICAL CLASSROOMS- IF THERE IS NOT AS MUCH MONEY AVAILABLE THE AMOUNTS OF RESOURCE AVAILABLE IS GOING TO BE RELATED TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH- FOUGHT IN CLASSROOM BRICK AND MORTAR INSTRUCTION CAN OCCUR. THANK YOU I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T THAT AS SOON MARK SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN DO MORE WITH LESS AND THAT'S WHY. THE SEND THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED A BUDGET YESTERDAY WHICH WOULD SAY FEDERAL MONEY OR NO FEDERAL MONEY WE CAN'T UNDER FUNDERS SCHOOLS BECAUSE- ONE IT'S NOT GONNA WORK WILL RASKIN THE DO INTO WE NEED OUR SCHOOLS BE FUND ALSO. FAMILIES CAN GO BACK TO WORK AND WE CAN HAVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE WORKING IN. SIX MILLION KIDS COULD HAVE A FUNCTIONAL- HOUSEHOLD SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADD- MISTER MCCARTY APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION AND YOUR SUPPORT FOR BUDGET. THAT SUPPORTS ALL THE THINGS WERE DEMANDING OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I JUST WANNA MAKE NOTE OF THE FACT THAT. THE STRONG HIM AS PRESIDENT OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A- A ROLE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS- BUT REACTS TO IT. AND I THINK THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE MORE MONEY OR LESS MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GOING. TO HAVE TO DO MORE WHETHER THEY HAVE MORE OR THEY HAVE LOST BECAUSE THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES AND WE ALL HAVE. CAN WE CAN'T JUST SAY WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY WE'RE NOT GONNA REMARKS. AND YOU WOULDN'T SUPPORT AT. BUT THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES AND WE ALL NEED A WHOLE HECK. WELL STAY SIX FEET APART. RIGHT AND WE IT WORK THIS OUT. SO WITH THAT MISTER ALI DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. NOW THERE ARE NO MORE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I WITH THAT THANK YOU TO OUR PANEL MISTER LANG HAMMOND. I THANK YOU JAMIE ONLY. WHEN OUR GREAT MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS A GREAT EXAMPLE. AND ALISON YOSHIMOTO TOWER YOU FROM A LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THANK YOU ALL. FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO MOVE OR THIRD PANEL.

IN LOS ANGELES ANTHONY WILL BE JOINING US BY TELEPHONE. BY TELEPHONE- IN ANTHONY ARE YOU THERE YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. IF YOU ARE THERE.

BOB WHY DON'T WE MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS- ON JACK IS OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JENNIFER PACK WITH THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. MISS PACKAGE HERE WITH US IN THE- IN THE ROOM. AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THANK HIM FOR BEING HERE TODAY MISS JENNIFER PACK. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. DURING THE COVERT ENVIRONMENT AND IN THE RE OPENING OF SCHOOL- MY ORGANIZATION THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. REPRESENTS THE CALIFORNIA AFTER SCHOOL ADVOCACY ALLIANCE WHICH IS OUR MANY AFTER SCHOOL PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ACTUALLY GONNA TAKE THIS OFF IF THAT'S OKAY FOR SPEAKING. OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. BUT IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT WHERE OUT OF SCHOOL TIME IS LITERALLY ALL THE TIME. THERE'S BEEN A BRIGHT LIGHT SHONE ON HOW IMPORTANT THESE PROGRAMS REALLY ARE FOR OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. SINCE OUR SCHOOL BUILDINGS CLOSE DOWN OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN PERFORMING A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES DEPENDING ON THE NEEDS OF THEIR SCHOOL COMMUNITY. THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDING VIRTUAL IN RICHMOND ACTIVITIES THEY'VE BEEN SUPPORTING MEAL DISTRIBUTION SOME HAVE PROVIDED SUPERVISION TO THE CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS. MANY HAVE BEEN CHECKING IN WITH KIDS REGULARLY TO SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT THEY'RE NEEDING. AARON SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE THE CHIP THE SACRAMENTO CHINESE COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER HAS BEEN PROVIDING TWO HOURS OF VIRTUAL IN RICHMOND EVERY SINGLE DAY. IT INCLUDES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY STEAM LITERACY SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND NUTRITION LESSONS IN LOS ANGELES A GROUP CALLED WHAT CRAFT RANGERS DEVELOPED AN ONLINE LEARNING PLATFORM. THAT CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH CELL PHONES AND IT HAS ENRICHED AND ACTIVITIES FOR KIDS AND SUPPORT RESOURCES FOR FAMILIES WHICH IS REACHING SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES ACROSS THAT REGION. THERE ARE MANY MORE EXAMPLES OF THIS KIND OF CREATIVITY AND COMMITMENT THAT I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO TODAY. BUT ONE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE STAFF TYPICALLY COME FROM THE SAME COMMUNITIES AS THE STUDENTS THEY SERVE. SO THEY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS. WITH THE KIDS AND THE FAMILIES. THAT MAKES THEM EXCEPTIONALLY VALUABLE IN THIS CONTEXT AND ESPECIALLY AROUND THIS VERY REAL CHALLENGE OF CONNECTING WITH DISCONNECTED KIDS. AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO RE OPEN IN THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR WITH DRAMATICALLY ADJUSTED SCHOOL SCHEDULES AND THE NEED FOR SMALLER GROUPS AND PHYSICAL DISTANCE THING AND INTENSE NEEDS FOR SOCIAL CONNECTION. WE HAVE TO LEAN ON OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN A VERY BIG WAY. WITH CLASS TIME POTENTIALLY HAPPENING AND SHIPS ARE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS CAN ALSO OPERATE IN SHIFTS. AND PROGRAMS CAN USE THAT TIME TO HELP KIDS COMPLETE CLASS WORK OR WITH HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS TO DO ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES. INCLUDING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FOCUS ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS. EVERY SCHOOL CASE MANAGER. OR SO I LEADERSHIP TEAM AND A MEMBER OF THE AFTER SCHOOL TEAM TO HELP INFORM WHAT'S GOING ON WITH INDIVIDUAL KIDS AND DEVELOP PLANS FOR SUPPORT. I SUGGEST THIS BECAUSE MANY OF OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ALREADY FUNCTION LIKE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GIVEN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER COMMUNITY AGENCIES AND THE FAMILIES. CURRENTLY WE FUND PROGRAMS FOR A THREE HOUR UNIT OF SERVICE SO IF PROGRAMS ARE CALLED UPON TO SUPPORT KIDS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WE HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW ADDITIONAL HOURS ARE GOING TO BE PAID FOR. IDEALLY WE WOULD BE INCREASING OUR INVESTMENT IN THE AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND SAFETY PROGRAM TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ONGOING OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE PROGRAMS CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF EACH SCHOOL COMMUNITY AND THE SCHEDULE THEY DECIDE UPON. ON TOP OF ADDITIONAL HOURS WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER THE SUPPLIES EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING NEEDED FOR THIS WORK FORCE IN ORDER TO KEEP THEMSELVES AND KIDS SAFE. HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CUT TO THE ASUS PROGRAM. WHICH IN A NORMAL YEAR WOULD MEAN MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WOULD LOSE THEIR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. BUT IN THIS CONTEXT WITH COSTS GOING UP AND NEEDS BEING SO INTENSE WE COULD LOSE A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THAT. AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHICH KIDS WOULD LOSE OUT NINE OUT OF TEN CHILDREN SERVED BY THE ASUS PROGRAM OUR CHILDREN OF COLOR. LEARNERS. AND 25% OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS STUDENTS ARE SERVED BY THESE PROGRAMS. THE FAMILIES OF THESE CHILDREN ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT BY THE IMPACTS OF CODE. AND THEY NEED THEIR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND THOSE RELATIONSHIPS PRESERVED. THE GOVERNOR STATED IN HIS REMARKS ON THE MAY REVISED THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE LEARNING LOSSES. TAKE CARE OF THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF OUR KIDS. AND GET THE ECONOMY MOVING SAFELY. OUR AFTER SCHOOL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA DOES ALL OF THESE THINGS AND WE SHOULD BE GROWING THIS INVESTMENT RATHER THAN TEARING IT DOWN. AS YOU ALL KNOW VERY WELL THE ASUS PROGRAM IS INCREDIBLY COST EFFICIENT WE PAY OUR PROVIDERS. EIGHT DOLLARS AN EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS PER CHILD PER DAY. WHICH IS BARELY ENOUGH TO PAY STAFF THE MINIMUM WAGE. WE ARE EXCEPTIONALLY GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR REJECTING THIS PROPOSED CUT. WHICH JUST MAKES NO SENSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE FACING IN THE COMING YEAR WE NEED ALL THE SKILLED CARING ADULTS WE CAN FIND TO TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS AS WE FACE INTENSIFIED NEEDS AND ADJUSTED SCHEDULES WE NEED TO LEAN ON OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE CITY PARK AND REC PROGRAMS ARE LIBRARIES. AND MORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISS PAC. GREAT JOB OF DESCRIBING WHAT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS DO THEY JUST DON'T KEEP KIDS BUSY WHICH IS IMPORTANT AS AFTER SCHOOL HOURS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KIDS ARE BUSY RIGHT BUT THEY PROVIDE ACADEMIC SUPPORT FOOD MANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ASUS PROGRAMS. ALSO HAVE- HAVE THAT PROVIDE SOME REAL ARE PART OF THE SUMMER MEALS PROGRAMS WHICH WAS EXPANDED TO THE COVERT NINETEEN SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PASSIONATE- DEFENSE AND OFFENSE PROGRAMS THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO- JARED CALL WITH THE CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES AND HE IS WITH US IN THE HEARING ROOM AREAS. MR CALL YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THANK YOU TERRA DONALD AND- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY TESTIMONY IS FOCUSED ON THE IMPACT OF COVER NINETEEN ON CHILD HUNGER. AND SCHOOL THE TRIP- GERALD ON APPRECIATED YOUR COMMENTS- IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS ABOUT THE MODERN DAY SUPER LINES THAT WERE SEEN AS SCHOOLS OF REALLY- REALLY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE- ALONG WITH FOOD BANKS BUT BUT SCHOOLS GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND- TO MEET THE INCREASE NEED I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF IN MY DESCRIPTION OF SORT OF THE PROBLEM AND FOCUS ON THREE PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE- WOULD LIKE TO SEIZE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS. TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE ADEQUATE NUTRITION NOT JUST OVER THE SUMMER BUT- WHEN SCHOOLS REOPENED SO I'LL JUST START WITH ONE I THINK VERY COMPELLING TO STICK ABOUT OVERNIGHT THE IMPACT ON FOOD. THAT THAT IS THAT A NASH SURVEY SHOW THAT ONE SIX MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE REPORTED. QUOTE THE CHIP IN MY HOUSEHOLD NOT EATING IT OFF BECAUSE WE JUST COULDN'T AFFORD IT FOOD. ONE IN SIX MOTHERS WITH KIDS UNDER TWELVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY REPORTING KIDS ARE RESET NO THIS WAS A CRITICAL ROLE NOURISHED STUDENTS AND THAT EVEN BEFORE HIT 6% OF OUR STUDENTS REPLIED ON FREE REDUCE. MEALS AND WE DO EXPECT THOSE NUMBERS ARE RIGHT WILL BE TO SELL ON THE IT'S IN A- SCHOOL ME. WELL DOT. THIRTY IN AND AS WE THE SPEAKERS TODAY STUDENTS FROM INCOME HOW AND STE OF COLOR FACE US OPPORTUNITY GAPS AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND CLOSING THOSE GAPS REQUIRES- EQUITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES INCLUDING THINGS LIKE SCHOOL MEALS SO AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT THE PHYSICAL STRAIN THAT DISTRICTS ARE FEELING AND SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS I THINK IN. IN PARTICULAR GIVEN- THE CAUGHT THE TERRIBLE COMBINATION OF INCREASED COST DUE TO NEW OPERATIONAL- IMPERATIVES AND THE DECREASE REVENUES DUE TO FEWER MEALS BEING SERVED BUT- IN ORDER TO PREVENT- HUNGER AMONG CALIFORNIA KIDS WE MUST ADEQUATELY FUND THE PROVISION OF MEALS AND ENSURE THAT CHILDREN CAN READILY ACCESS THOSE MEALS. GIVEN OUT ALL A MOVE ON TO THE THREE OPPORTUNITIES WE SEE A CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES AND AMONG OUR ANTI HUNGER PARTNERS. THE FIRST IS TO PAIR- EXTENDED FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY EASE- WITH YOU STATE POLICY- AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED- THERE WAS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY OFFERED BY THE USDA% THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE- TO GRANT WAIVERS THAT ENABLE ELEAZAR TO SERVE MEALS IN THAT GRAB AND GO STYLE- AND THEN EARLY IN IN MID MARCH- GOVERNOR NEWSOME ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER AND TWENTY SIX TWENTY. WHICH TO STAND STATE EDUCATION FUNDING DURING THE COVERED RELATED SCHOOL CLOSURES AND ALSO SUPPORTED THE CONTINUED MEAL SERVICE. SINCE THEN AS I SAID WE SEEN IT SCHOOLS TO THE INCREDIBLE WORK OF OFFERING FREE SCHOOL MEALS TO CHILDREN IN THE HELLO THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. NOW USDA RECENTLY EXTENDED A LOT OF THOSE KEY WAIVERS THROUGH AUGUST THIRTIETH BUT THERE REMAINS NO FEDERAL OR STATE POLICY GUARANTEEING ACCESS TO MEALS FOR STUDENTS DURING THE SUMMER. IN A TYPICAL YEAR WE DO ALWAYS SEE FOOD INSECURITY AMONG LOW INCOME KIDS SPIKE DURING THE SUMMER SUMMER FEEDING PROGRAMS I DO INCREDIBLE WORK BUT ARE ONLY ABLE TO REACH IN A TYPICAL YEAR ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT. OF CHILDREN IN NEED AND WE DO EXPECT THIS YEAR TO BE WORSE. AT ALL THAT SAID WE CERTAINLY THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR INCLUDING AND THEIR BUDGET PROPOSAL HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL DISCRETIONARY FUNDING TO SUPPORT MAIL SERVICE IN MARIN WE STRONGLY URGE THE ADMINISTRATIVE. TO INCLUDE THAT VERSION IN THEIR FINAL BUDGET WERE ALSO CALLING FOR A CONTINUE EXPECTED. OF MEALS OR DURING THE SUMMER SO THAT KIDS CAN A GARY. ACTS TO THAT MY NEEDED NUTRITION DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. THAT'S OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY OUR SECOND IS- PANDEMIC EBT. OR P. B. T. HAS ALL REFER TO IT IN MY REMARKS OF PVC IS A NEW BUT TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM TO HELP. I'M LEASE PURCHASE FOOD- THAT THEY- WHAT SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED DURING COVER NINETEEN IT'S INTENDED TO HELP REPLACE THOSE LOST MEALS AT SCHOOLS THAT KIDS ARE ACCESSING DURING SCHOOL CLOSURES. SO KIDS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR P. B. T. IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS WHICH MEANS THEY'RE ALSO ELIGIBLE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR IMMIGRANT RICH STATE. BUT THE DEADLINE TO APPLY FOR P. B. T. FOR FAMILIES IS JUST THE END OF THIS MONTH IS COMING UP IN JUST TWO WEEKS ON JUNE THIRTIETH. SO WE'RE CALLING ON ELEAZAR IN CD TO HELP. BY CONDUCTING TARGETED OUTREACH TO FAMILIES LIVING IN THOUGH THEY NEED TO APPLY AND ALSO WE'RE CALLING ON FEDERAL LEADERS TO EXTEND AND EXPAND PBC THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE CRISIS AND WE WOULD INVITE. AND URGE THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION TO DO JUST THE SAME IN CALLING ON FEDERAL LEADERS TO EXTEND AND EXPAND PBT WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING SOLUTIONS TO THIS HUNGER SPECTER ODD TO THE SCHOOL CLOSURES. AND THE THIRD OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY MAXIMIZE UPTAKE OF WHAT'S CALLED THE COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION OR C. E. P. C. E. P. IS A FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED OPTION FOR PROVIDING TWO MEALS FREE OF CHARGE TO ALL STUDENTS EACH DAY. WITHOUT THE NEED TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. A WE HAVE MANY SCHOOLS TO BE LA. TO TAKE UP SEE P. THIS. YEAR BECAUSE IT'S TIED TO- STUDENT NEED. AND THAT'S YOUR OF STUDENTS ARE ACCESSING PROGRAMS LIKE HOW FRESH AND MEDICARE WHICH WE KNOW WE'RE SPIKING RIGHT NOW DUE TO THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. SO THE DEADLINE FOR SCHOOLS TO APPLY TO OPERATE C. P. HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY USDA TO AUGUST THIRTY FIRST. AND SO WE REALLY REALLY ARE URGING SCHOOLS TO SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAXIMIZE THE REACH OF SCHOOL MEALS WHICH ALSO DRAWS DOWN ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING. SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT CD E. ISSUE- GUIDANCE STRONGLY ENCOURAGING ELEAZAR TO APPLY FOR C. P. THIS YEAR BEFORE THAT AUGUST THIRTY FIRST DEADLINE. AND PROVIDE TARGETED TECHNICAL ASSISTANT. DELEGATES TO ENSURE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE UP TAKE. TO FEED OUR KIDS AND AGAIN MAXIMIZE THAT FEDERAL FUNDING DRIVE DOWN. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY AND I'M THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND HAPPY TO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THINK AND I'M SURE AND I'M WELCOME COMING UP AND I'LL PAY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE WHAT IS AN GOING OFF THEIR SCHOOLS AND FOOD. THE FACT AS I ALLUDED TO EARLIER THAT YOU WILL SEE LINES OF CARS- WITH KIDS IN THEM. LINING UP TO RECEIVE FOOD BECAUSE- THEY DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO PURCHASERS THEY CAN OBTAIN FOR. AND IT'S RATHER TRAGIC TO SEE THAT SIDE BUT IT IS REAL IT IS HAPPENING IN THE STATE. TO DAY- AND I WANT TO COMPLIMENT. THE SUPER HAD A PUBLIC INSTRUCTION HIS OFFICE WAS VERY- VERY EFFECTIVE IN SIGNING UP DISTRICTS FOR THE SUMMER MEALS PROGRAM SOME LAGGED. AND THEIR PARTICIPATION BUT WERE ABLE TO GET SIGNED UP IN A VERY. EXPEDITIOUS FASHION I MEAN I THINK ON THE TUNE OF LIKE SEVEN HUNDRED. IN A VERY QUICK MANNER SO CONGRATULATIONS- TO THE- TO THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE FOR THE FINE WORK THEY DID. AND I JUST DO WANNA WORKING WE TALK ABOUT ASUS PROBABLY YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR BIGGEST CHAMPION IS IN THIS ROOM IT'S MISTER MCCARTY. WHO CHAIRS BUDGET SUB TO IS DONE A GREAT JOB. OF DEFENDING THE PROGRAM AND ALSO GOING ON OFFENSE TO ENSURE THAT THIS BODY. BOTH BODIES NOT RESTORE FUNDING. TO THE ASUS PROGRAM AS HAS- THE GOOD SENATOR TO MY RIGHT. SO WITH THAT- IT. IS ANTHONY FLORES ALVAREZ ON THE PHONE. HEARING I CAN HEAR YOU. YOUR LIFE. HI THANK YOU I CAN I BEGIN YOU MAY YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRAND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY I'M HERE REPRESENTING NOT ONLY THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA THE COUNTER STUDENTS STATEWIDE. TODAY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE CONCERN HAS ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY CALLED THE NINETEEN STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE CURRENTLY NAVIGATING WAYS OF DEALING WITH THE GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMICS UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY HAVE EVER FACED BEFORE. WHILE SOME STUDENTS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PERSEVERE THROUGH THE CIRCUMSTANCES COUNTLESS OTHERS HAVE LOST ACCESS TO THE ONLY SUPPORT SYSTEM THEY HAD. ASSEMBLY ONYX. THE SHIP LIKE ON THESE ISSUES THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA MOBILIZE GOODNESS FROM OVER THIRTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE COMPLETE A SURVEY ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CALL THE NINETEEN ON THE MANTLE OF BEING. AFTER COMPILING ALL THE DATA FINDINGS FROM THE STUDY THERE ARE THREE KEY FINDINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. FIRST I THREE TOWNS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE 24% OF STUDENTS. REPORTED SEEING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR COVER NINETEEN. PREVIOUSLY RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FEEL LIKE THEY NEED THEM NOW. THIS FINDING MEANS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS COULD REQUIRE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ONE SCHOOLS RE OPENED. ALSO FOUND THAT DESPITE 61% OF STUDENTS REPORTING POSITIVE MENTAL BEINGS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. OVER 51% OF STUDENTS NOW BELIEVE THEIR MENTAL BEING PASSED SIGNIFICANTLY WORSENED. THIS FINDING SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD INCREASE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. YOU CAN MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS WELCOME BACK TO SCHOOL WITH SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION TO THEIR MENTAL WELL BEING. FINALLY WHEN AFTER SURE THE REASONS WHY THEY FEEL STRESSED OUR URVEY FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS REPORTED SIMILAR REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE SOME STUDENTS STATED THAT THEY ARE STRUGGLING BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT EXISTS IN THE VERY HOME. THEY'RE CURRENTLY COMBINED TO. PRINCETON IN ONE SITTING ON WORDS QUOTE I LOVE TO GET AWAY FROM HOME AND GO TO SCHOOL FOR WATER TO GET ANY ISSUES. AND NOTHING GOING PARTNER. EASY TO HANDLE THE CONFLICTING EMOTIONS AND CALL. ANOTHER STUDENT SAID WELL. I AN EXTROVERT WHO DEPEND ON SCHOOL AND FRIEND AS MY OWN SUPPORT SYSTEM. MY HOME IS NOT AND I ON BY. BASICALLY OF MY CO SKILLS HAVE BEEN TAKE FROM ME TO THE POINTING THAT BECOME A- MENTALLY ILL. AND QUIRK. HOWEVER THE MOST COMMON REASON STUDENTS ARE STRESSING DURING THIS PANDEMIC AGAIN BECAUSE THE BOUNCING BASS SOME THIS WILL WORK WITH OTHER RESPONSIBILITY. WE EXPECT OUR STUDENTS TO EXCEL ACADEMICALLY COMPLETE ASSIGNMENTS ON TIME AND GO ABOVE AND BEYOND HOME. WITHOUT EVER CONSIDERING THE SOME STUDENTS OF THE NINE CLASSES. SOME OF WHICH ARE COLLEGE LEVEL THREE CONTINUALLY UPLOADING NEW ASSIGNMENTS AND EXACT. SIMULTANEOUSLY THE STUDENTS HAVE TO DEAL WITH NOT IN THE GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMICS ACCOUNTING FEELINGS OF BOREDOM. STRESS ANXIETY AND THE P. THAT WE HEAVILY ON THEIR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS WHEN THE STUDENTS CORNET GOOD SCENARIO IN ONLY WORRY ABOUT SCHOOL WORK AND IT WILL BE. IMAGINE STUDENT LIVING IN A SMALL STUDIO PART. WITH THE SAP EIGHT HAVING A FOCUS ON DOING PILES OF ONLINE ASSIGNMENTS AND EXAMS FOR UP TO NINE DIFFERENT COURSES AT A TIME. WHAT TIME OKAY WE HAVE CARE FOR THE SICK AND ARE GOOD. STUDENT WILL HAVE TO ABOUT COUNTY CLUBS EXAM PREP. CALL ESSAYS AND THE- OF THE CALL DIDN'T PROCESS. MORE IN MORE WE FEASTED HAVE TO DO SCHOOL. OVER SUSTAINING THEIR MENTALBE. THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPAIRED. THAT YOU TAKE INTO A THE INDIVIDUAL. THAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS FACE DAILY AS YOU MAKE YOUR DIFFICULT DECISIONS ON REOPENING SCHOOLS. TO FACILITATE THAT PROCESS WE ASK OUR STUDENTS TO SAY WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGE AND THEIR SCHOOLS NEXT YEAR. THE VAST MAJORITY TOUCH ON THE SAME THING. THEY WANT SCHOOLS TO HAVE A STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. STUDENTS ARE TIRED OF HAVING TO FIGHT WITH THE ONLY COUNTER THE MUST ATTEND TO OVER A HUNDRED STUDENTS EVERY WEEK. TO SOLVE THIS. SCHOOL DISTRICTS STATEWIDE SHOULD REPLACEPOLICE OFFICERS WITH SCHOOL COUNSELORS PSYCHOLOGISTS AND NURSES. BECAUSE TODAY IF YOU HAVE SUPPORT IN THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT IN RECORD NUMBERS BECAUSE THE HAN COURT AND POLICE BRUTALITY THIS TO US. ALLOWING POLICE OFFICERS ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS IT. NOT ONLY MAKE SOME STUDENTS AFRAID OF ATTENDING SCHOOL BUT ALSO CALLED UNNECESSARY STRESS AND WORRY THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. AFTER ALL OUR SCHOOLS OUR COMMUNITY AND LIFELINE. PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT WITH MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND LASTLY WE THINK. WE'LL BE ABLE TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION FROM WHICH ALL STUDENTS CAN RECOVER FROM THIS PANDEMIC AND ADEQUATELY SIXTY. THANK YOU IN. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERGE. ALSO OF YOU BUT DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IS REGARDING NO. ONE QUICK QUESTION YEAH DECIMATED IN A PINE ABOUT THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES TO AND HOW THAT PLAYS INTO THIS AS WELL A LITTLE BIT MORE PRESS. SURE AT THE START OF THIS BUDGET SEASON BEFORE COVERT HIT- THE AFTER SCHOOL COMMUNITY WAS BACK WITH AN ADDITIONAL BUDGET INCREASE REQUEST TO JUST HELP OUR PROGRAMS KEEP PACE WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH IS SET TO GO UP AGAIN IN JANUARY AND SO. WE'VE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAMS WILL STAY AFLOAT GIVEN A CUT OR EVEN REMAINING FLAT GOING TO YOUR EARLIER POINT ABOUT ADDITIONAL SERVICES BEING REQUIRED- WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND GIVEN THAT WERE BARELY PAYING STAFF MINIMUM WAGE NOW IT'S UNCLEAR TO US HOW WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THIS WORK FORCE AT THE LEVEL THAT WE HAVE IT NOW- SO THAT. THAT'S AN UNRESOLVED QUESTION. YEAH AND JUST- I CONCUR WITH FIRST I WOULD WHEN I WANT TO PAY THESE WORKERS POVERTY WAGES AS MY KIDS SAY IN THEIR LITTLE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM HERE THEY STATE THAT SOME OTHER STAFF TO WORK AT STARBUCKS YES THEY MAKE MORE. THAN SERVING OUR KIDS AND SO WHAT WE VALUE MARK. CAPPUCCINO LATTE WHATEVER OUR KIDS AFTER SCHOOL SO I THINK THAT'S A BIGGER QUESTION BUT- I THINK THE POINT IS THAT IF YOU DON'T REALIZE THIS. IS JUST THAT MATH PLAYS OUT AND YOU SIR. FOR YOUR KIDS. THAT'S RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY JUST SERVE YOUR KIT SO THAT WE WANT TO DO BY NOT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TRY TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK SO THAT'S WHY. ARE BUDGET DOES IS IN A BUDGET HEARING TODAY BUT OUR BUDGET. SAID THAT WE WANT TO REJECT REGARDLESS OF THAT TRIGGERS ARE NOT. THE CATEGORICAL CUTS TO ASUS BECAUSE- IT WOULD WE NEED IT MORE THAN EVER NOW AND THEN THE REALITY CHECK IS WE WOULD SERVE FEWER KIDS. RIGHT HAD TO MAKE THE REDUCTIONS PLUS. THE MINIMUM WAGE WE NEED ACTUALLY AN INCREASE TO JUST. ACKNOWLEDGE THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE. RIGHT RIGHT. AND IF I MAY REFER BACK TO THE NEED FOR OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAMS SO CURRENTLY THE EIGHT DOLLARS AN EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS IS LIKE I SAID IT'S BASED ON A THREE HOUR UNIT OF SERVICE- YOU KNOW LIKE MANY OTHER THINGS THERE'S AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IN PLACE RIGHT NOW THAT. ALLOWED THE PROGRAMS TO WORK DIFFERENT HOURS- NOT HAVE TO TAKE ATTENDANCE AT CENTER OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION. THAT OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE NEEDED IN AN ONGOING WAY. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY HOPING FOR. IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CAN HAVE. SOME MORE AUTHORITY IN AN ONGOING WAY AROUND LOOKING AT THAT DAILY RATE. HOURS OF OPERATION AT CETERA SO THERE CAN BE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN THE SYSTEM IN THE COMING YEAR TO BE ABLE TO SERVE A SCHOOL COMMUNITIES NEEDS WITH THE HOURS OF SERVICE. BUT IT REALLY NEEDS AND THAT COULD END UP SERVING SLIGHTLY FEWER KIDS THAN WERE SERVING NOW. BUT I THINK WITH WE DO THAT IN A TARGETED WAY. IT'S BETTER THAN LOSING A HUGE AMOUNT OF OUR WORK FORCE WHICH IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN YEAH YOU LOOKING IN. TO PROPOSALS CHANGES TO LET'S TURN THIS YEAR. YES IN FACT WE HAVE PUT FORWARD SOME BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AROUND THIS- THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT WITH YOUR STAFF- WE HAVE SOME SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS THAT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER ON HOW THAT FLEXIBILITY COULD BE BENEFICIAL. OKAY THANK YOU ALL FOLLOW UP ON THAT TOO. THANK YOU THANK YOU INSTALLING. I'M MR CALL SO YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE P. M. EDT PANDEMIC WHAT WAS THE DEADLINE ON THAT FOR. THIRTIETH FOR FAMILIES TO APPLY- SOME FAMILIES HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THEIR CARDS AUTOMATICALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE ENROLLED IN ANOTHER MEANS TESTED PROGRAM BUT FAMILIES WHO ARE NOT HAVE TO APPLYTO VERY SHORT ONLINE APPLICATION- AND WE CAN SHOW THAT YOU ARE ALL IF THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL BUT- YEAH WE REALLY TO. ENCOURAGE ELLIE A STATE TO REACH OUT THERE THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS TO THEIR STUDENTS TO THEIR TO THEIR FAMILIES- ABOUT WHAT THIS PROGRAM IS AND HOW SIMPLE IT IS TO APPLY AND ACCESS THAT IT'S THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS IN FOOD BENEFITS PER CHILD. OKAY SO HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT TARGETED OUTREACH RIGHT NOW WITH LIKE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE JUST EMAILING TO THE COUNTY SEAT THAT'S YEAH THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND CD TO GET THE SYSTEM SET UP AND RUNNING- BUT THERE'S AN ONLINE APPLICATION I WAS ACTUALLY SET UP BY- CODE FOR AMERICA. THAT NONPROFIT- AND SO WE WORK WITH WE JUST REALLY FEEL LIKE ELEAZER AGAIN THE BEST MESSENGER AND THEY KNOW WHERE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT MINE KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD DOT WHAT WE GOT SOME MATERIALS THAT WERE HAPPY TO SHARE OUT IN TERMS OF GENERAL INFORMATION OUT HM. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SMITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT THE IT ALL A OUR OUR PANELISTS TO. THE COMMENTS FROM EACH OF YOU- REGARDING JUST THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURAL SUPPORTS THAT HAVE TO BE IN PLACE. FOR KIDS TO THRIVE. A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AFTER SCHOOL IN SUPPORT WITH WITH HOMEWORK AND ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES AND- FOOD. IT IS ELEMENTAL. THAT OUR CHILDREN EAT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE. TO LEARN AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY IN YOU BEING HERE TODAY. AND I SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO. CALL OUT MISTER FLORES ALVAREZ I THINK HIS LEADERSHIP AS A STUDENT- DOUBT IS AN AMBITIOUS UNDERTAKING TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF YOUR PEERS AND WE APPRECIATE YOU. AND IT SHOULD ALSO BE MENTIONED THAT THESE ARE STUDENTS. ASKING FOR THIS HELP WHAT MR FLOORS OVER AS POINTS TO. IS THAT IN MOST OF OUR HIGH SCHOOLS WE REMAIN AND WE CYCLE AFTER CYCLE REMAIN PERSISTENTLY UNDERSTAFFED. WITH SUPPORTS FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH NOT ENOUGH PSYCHOLOGISTS NOT ENOUGH NURSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SOCIAL WORKERS AND WHEN WE DO HAVE COUNSELORS. TYPICALLY THAT RATIO IS ONE COUNSELOR TO SEVERAL HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND BY NO MEANS CANNOT COUNSELOR DO AN ADEQUATE JOB OF PROVIDING FOR THOSE-CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. LET ALONE WELL DEVELOPED ACADEMIC SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED IN PLACE TO FINISH THEIR ACADEMIC CAREERS SO. AT SOME POINT AS A STATE WE HAVE GOT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT THIS BUT AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO FUNDING WHEN YOU ARE IN NEED BOB I'M- IN THE- STATES IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. HOW DO YOU AFFORD THESE REALLY CRITICAL SUPPORT SO. I THANK YOU MISTER FLOOR OVER AS FREE ADVOCATE I HOPE YOU KEEP UP AND I LOVE TO HERE IN LET. SOMEDAY THANK YOU SEE.
