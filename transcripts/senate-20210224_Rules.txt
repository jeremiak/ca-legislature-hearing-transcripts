AND GOING FORWARD. IN ADDITION THE AYE SO IS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE REST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EMPLOYMENT SOME OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES IN THE WORLD. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS WORK IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE OBVIOUS AS WE SEE INCREASED CLIMATE EVENTS. AND MY DEDICATION TO SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S GOALS. WHILE MAINTAINING RELIABILITY IS ABSOLUTE. WE ARE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS ENTERING INTO A PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING BUT ALSO IMPORTANT AND EXCITING TIMES AS WE DRAW CLOSER TO ACHIEVING AGGRESSIVE RTS GOALS. AND START THINKING HARD ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD TOWARDS A CARBON FREE ENERGY FUTURE. I VERY MUCH WANT TO BE PART OF THAT PROCESS AND CONVERSATION WOULD BE DELIGHTED IF YOU WERE WILLING TO GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GO AHEAD MISS GALLAGHER.

THANK YOU SO MUCH. MORE MEMBERS IT IS OUR RELIABLE GRAND AND TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MEET OUR AMBITIOUS ENERGY. AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS IN A RELIABLE. RESILIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER EVERY HOUR EVERY SINGLE DAY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS I'M EXCITED TO CONTINUE WORKING TOWARDS MAKING THE BRAND MORE RELIABLE HARNESSING A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO RESOURCE. FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON SOLAR ENERGY BUT ALSO WENT ON SHORE AND OFF SHORE JIM CARMEL BIOMASS HYDRO POWER AND STORAGE. OR AT THE SAME TIME AS MENTIONS WE ALL HAVE SEEN THAT WE CANNOT TAKE REGARD PROGRAMS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE FACT THAT UNEXPECTED AND SOMETIMES UNFORESEEABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND OPERATIONAL FISHES FOR THE CAR. RELIABILITY IS OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE AND IS BOARD CHAIR I WILL FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT THE ISO MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD CONTINUES TO WORK WITH ALL RELEVANT PARTIES AND STAKEHOLDERS. TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE GREAT EVENTS WE EXPERIENCED LAST SUMMER RESULTING IN ROLLING BLACKOUTS NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. ALONG WITH A DIVERSE RESOURCE PORTFOLIO AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OPERATING A RELIABLE GRANT WHILE MAINTAINING ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP IS BETTER REGIONAL COOPERATION. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ISO LAUNCHED THE REAL TIME ENERGY IMBALANCEMARKET REFERRED TO AS THE YAYA IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH BY ALL ACCOUNTS HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL INITIATIVES RESULTING IN OVER ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN SAVINGS AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF CO TWO REDUCTIONS ACROSS THE WEST WHILE IMPROVING RELIABILITY AND INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLE. MARKET NOW COVERS THE STATE AND OVER EIGHTY. OF THE WESTERN WORLD. WE'RE CURRENTLY THE PROCESS OF FINE TUNING ADDITIONAL MARKET DESIGN ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL BRING GREAT. THE CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'RE DOING ALL THIS WHILE MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA I ASSUME BOARD LEADERSHIP. THURSDAY JUNE MARKET IS VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVE FOR ENSURING RELIABILITY IN WHICH I AM DEEPLY AND PERSONALLY INVOLVED AS THE BOARD REPRESENTATIVE ON THE E. I AM GOVERNANCE REVIEW COMMITTEE. I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ICE ON ANOTHER RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD NABLE BETTER INTEGRATION OF LOCAL CALIFORNIA GROWN RESOURCES. SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY DEMAND RESPONSE AND CUSTOMER CALLED BEHIND THE METER TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING DISTRIBUTED SOLAR STORAGE AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THESE INITIATIVES AND TECHNOLOGIES WILL HELP US HARNESS LOCAL RESOURCES TO IMPROVE THE RESILIENCY AND RELIABILITY BOTH OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE GRANT. A LONG PERSONAL GOAL HAS BEEN TO THE US SOLICITOR AND INTERNATIONAL LEADER IN RELIABLY INTEGRATING RENEWABLES. I AM PROUD TO REPORT THAT THE ISO IN CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED ON A GLOBAL SCALE. IN FACT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN REPRESENTATIVES FROM OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY COUNTRIES HAVE MET FOR THE ARE TEAM. TO LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCE ALSO IN TWENTY TWENTY THE ISO WAS ELECTED TO PRESIDE OVER THE GULF FIFTEEN ORGANIZATION. WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATION OPERATORS THIS IS A TESTAMENT. OF OUR STANDING ON A GLOBAL SCALE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO ENSURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA ISO CONTINUES TO BE A SHINING EXAMPLE OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE. AND THAT WE ARE READY TO TAKE ON THE FUTURE AND PROVIDE RELIABLE SERVICE JUST FOR ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN THE OPENINGS I'M GONNA GIVE SENATOR BATES A BREAK FOR ONCE AND- LOOK TO THE MAJORITY LEADER OVER THERE TO START AND I'M SURE HE HAS QUITE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THIS IS A AEROSPACE MADAM OF PROTEST AND I JUST WANT TO. RECORD TO SAY THAT- FOR ONE OF THE- INDIVIDUALS ARE CONSIDERING ANGELA NEGLECT OF I'VE KNOWN HER FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS IN MY PREVIOUS RENEWABLE ENERGY. EXPERIENCE I AM DEEPLY YOU KNOW WE TALKED YOU MENTIONED BOTH ABOUT RELIABILITY OF THE GRID AND RELIABLE SERVICES FOR ALL. IN THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH BOTH OF YOU IN PREPARATION FOR THIS HEARING TODAY. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU STRESS FOR THE RECORD ON THE ONE HAND AND ALSO TO GET YOUR BOTH. THE PROFESSORA BHAGWAT AND- IF CHAIR GO A- YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS BECAUSE I AM. DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF RELIABILITY WE HAVE WORKED A LOT AS WE SEEK TO TRANSITION. R. GRADE FROM THE OLD ONE BASED UPON COAL AND NATURAL GAS AND TO SOME EXTENT- HYDROPOWER FRED KEWLEY- TO. TO YOU KNOW A RENEWABLE GREEN SOURCES BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT CENTER PROCUREMENT ALL OF THESE DYNAMICS. AS WE FACE IS YOU BOTH MENTIONED THESE EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS LAST YEAR DESPITE PEOPLE'S JUDGMENT WE FACED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN PROVIDING THAT RELIABILITY IT'S HARD FOR US TO. DETERMINE THAT BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSITIONS AND HAVING BACK UP POWER IN BATTERIES THAT ONLY LAST A FEW HOURS AND ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES AND TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING SO I WANTED TO. SEE IF EITHER OF THE BOTH OF YOU HAD SOME COMMENTS IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE I AM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED AS YOU TALK TO THE BEST EXPERTS IN CLIMATE THAT WE'RE GONNA FACE SIGNIFICANT. HE CHALLENGES COME OCTOBER NOVEMBER. EVENT THAT COULD HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RELIABILITY. AND THERE'S ALSO A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE DEALING WITH TRYING TO CONVERT THE- GRID TO BE MORE GREENER THAN CONFUSE ME PROCUREMENT TO BE MORE GREEN. AND SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES IF YOU CAN JUST- A TELL ME WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE RISKS. AND BE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR JUDGE IT WOULD YOU SHOULD WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. TO ENSURE THAT AND I JUST FINALLY WANT TO MAKE THE POINT. AND YOU COULD ADDRESS THIS THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR- ELECTRONS IF YOU WILL OR POWER IN COULD INCLUDE NATURAL GAS AND OTHERS. IS QUITE CHALLENGING BECAUSE WE HAVE THE ENERGY COMMISSION WE HAVE THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET WE GOT THE WESTERN REGIONAL GREAT WE'VE GOT YOU WE'VE GOT THE P. YOU SEE. AND HOW DO YOU SEE OUR ABILITY TO WADE THROUGH THIS IF YOU EIGHTY THINK I'M CORRECTED IF I AM WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU DO TO FIX IT. SO I. HAVE TO TAKE A FIRST SHOT SO I'M GONNA I THINK REPEAT SOMETHINGS THAT ENTERING THE SENATE EARLIER WHICH I FULLY AGREE WITH. WHICH IS OF COURSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT RELIABILITY I THINK EVERYONE IS AND IT'S OUR PRIMARY JOB YEAH SO. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT LAST AUGUST DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN- I THINK WE'VE LEARNED SOME IMPORTANT LESSONS ONE OF WHICH IS. THE STORAGE CLEAN THINKING ABOUT RELIABILITY THE FOCUS HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON MID AFTERNOON ON HOT DAYS. WE'VE LEARNED THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU NEED TO BE FOCUSING. FIRST OF ALL ON IT'S LATER IN THE EVENING. WHICH IS WHEN WE RAN INTO TROUBLE BUT REALLY WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IT'S NO LONGER. THE WAY BUSINESS WAS DONE IN THE PAST IS NOT THE WAY IT'S GONG TO BE DONE IN THE FUTURE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS ABOVE ALL ELSE AGAIN COMPETING WITH ANGEL IN THE SENTENCE. WE NEED TO HAVE A MUCH MORE DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF RESOURCES WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON THAT. GOING FORWARD. THAT IS NOT WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY AS THE HI SO PRIMARILY THAT IS PRIMARILY THE CPC'S AUTHORITY. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE REALLY WORKED HARD ON AND REALLY. PUSHING TO WORK HARD CURRENTLY GOING FORWARD IS. PRECISELY AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER THERE ARE A LOT OF AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE CDC. AND THE CPSC AND WE HAVE TO BE WORKING IN COORDINATION. WE HAVE TO BE GIVING LOTS AND LOTS OF INPUT. INTO THE CPSC'S PROCUREMENT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT MIX OF RESOURCE. I THINK A LOT ANGELES. THANK YOU MUCH AND YOU WE ARE. TO A NEW GRAD AND WE OPTIONS. TO RENEW. AND WE SEE IT EVERY DAY THAT THE GRANT IS BECOMING MORE DISTRIBUTED. MODERN VERSIFIED. WANTED CARBONIZED MORE DIGITIZED AND MORE DEMOCRATIZED. AND ALL RESOURCES NEED TO REFLECT OPTIONS SO WE CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE NEED FOR DIFFERENT RESOURCES SO WE HAVE A VERY PORTFOLIO AND WE ARE NOT. STROLLER CENTRIC OVERLY DEPENDENT ON ONE RESOURCE WHICH CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY WITH FLEXIBILITY AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHEN WE NEED VERY FAST RAMPING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MEET THAT EVENING OKAY. AND WHICH IS WHERE OUR VULNERABILITY. SO CLIMATE CHANGE YES THAT IS AN ISSUE AND WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE FORESEEABLE CHANGES. AND BE READY TO WITHSTAND MUCH MORE FREQUENT AND HARDER HE WAY. ACTUALLY INCOME PASSED THE GREATER WEST. WHAT WAS REALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS HUGE STORM THAT WE EXPERIENCED LAST YEAR WHICH IS ONE ZERO THIRTY FIVE OR FIFTY OR AT LATIMES. DOT A CARD YET WE HAD A ONCE IN A TEN YEAR EVENT ON THE GRANT STILL WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. BECAUSE THE HEAT WAVE YEAH.LAS VEGAS IN WASHINGTON. OREGON AND YOU HAD A REDUCE SOME OF THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES THAT MORE OF THE GRANT. AND WE ALSO RELIED ON RESOURCES TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. NUMBER FOUR FLEXIBILITY AT THE END OF THE DAY. THAT ACTUALLY NEEDED TO RAMP UP FASTER ARM. SO THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED WE WORKED TOGETHER WITH THE AGENCIES AND THAT'S ACTUALLY. THE I SO THE CC. YOU SEE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND THE WATER BOARD NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ALONG WITH ALL OF THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES SUCH AS THE UTILITIES. INVESTOR ALL PUBLICLY OWNED AND THE STREETS CA. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO MEET THE EVENING PEAK SO STAY IN THE EVENING PEAK IN ALL CONDITIONS. AND BE PREPARED FOR ALL FOR SCALABLE CLIMATE. CHANGES THAT CAN OCCUR AND ALSO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. TRY TO BE PREPARED FOR THE- OF COURSE YOU. WE HAVE A- WE HAVE A PLAN SEAT. AND THERE'S GREAT OPERA. MANUAL TO OFFER WE USED TO HOW TO FIGHT. WITH THE NO AND WE'VE HAD TO DO IT. WHETHER IT'S THE ARE STILL OFFER OPEN THAT WE TO WORK UP AND TOGETHER ACROSS BOARD. QUICKLY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE RELIABLE. OR WITH A STRUCTURE. SO X. YOUR NEXT. IS DREAM OF GAME MAIN REAL. AND WE CALL TO BE A SLIGHT. AS POSSIBLE AND AS- VISION TO WORK THE FUTURE AS POSSIBLE TO FOR THE- OF DEATH. NOT TO MAKE MISTAKES OF MESSING WATCH WE SHOULD HAVE CITY. MANAGER CLASS BEFORE QUESTION. THANK YOU I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OVER BUT ALSO WANTED ABOUT. THIS ISSUE OF THE ON FOR. MY UNDERSTANDING IN THE SUBJET AREA IS THAT ARE RESOURCE ADEQUACYHAS BEEN THIN. THAT WONDER 15% THAT TO THE EXTENT LIKE WE SAW LAST YEAR YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN THE DOCTOR BHAGWAT SAID YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT WHAT HAPPENED LAST AUGUST DOESN'T HAPPEN WELL IT WAS UNFORESEEABLE. AND THE REASON WE HAVE THE PROBLEM AND FROM WHAT I'VE TO IN TALKING TO YOUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER. IS BECAUSE- WE DIDN'T HAVE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE ADEQUACY. AND SO WE DID WE WEREN'T PREPARED TO LOOK FOR THE UNFORESEEABLE AND WHAT WE KNOW FROM CLIMATE EXTREME CLIMATE CONDITIONS. AND PARTICULARLY WHAT WE THINKING ABOUT THE WAY ON WHAT PERCENTAGE IT IS THAT WE HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THAT. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA CAMP IN A POSITION WHERE LIGHTS GO ON AGAIN. SO MY QUESTION IS TWO THINGS ONE. WHAT WHAT HOMEWORK HAVE YOU DONE WITH RESPECT TO COORDINATING WE MUST COORDINATE OKAY DID YOU DO IT. WHAT HAS IT BEEN IMPROVE WITH RESPECT TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN THE PEAK STEEP THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. IF THE ANSWER IS YES TO HAVE YOU INCREASED YOUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY TO BE ABLE TO BE PREPARED FOR THE UNFORGETTABLE BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET. BEING PREPARED FOR THE UNFORESEEABLE WANTED TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THOSE THINGS AND I GUESS THE THIRD POINT IS. YOU KNOW I JUST THINK WE NEED IS A LEGISLATURE AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS AND I HAVEN'T DISCUSSES WITH PROTERRA. BUT MUCH MORE OVERSIGHT BECAUSE WE KEEP THE RISK IS JUST TOO HIGH TO ALL OF US. IN ENSURING THAT WE DON'T SEE THESE SITUATIONS AGAIN. IF YOU CAN JUST GIVE US SOME REACTIONS ON THOSE I'D APPRECIATE. I THINK I CAN SPEAK TO THE I. SEVEN THAT WE AREWE WELCOME DIALOGUE WITH THE LEGISLATURE ALL TYPES- AND THAT'S- AND I THINK. MANAGEMENT WOULD AGREE WITH THAT EVERYONE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT ABSOLUTELY A PARTNERSHIP. WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CPC OF OURS IS A PART TIME BOARD BUT THE CLEAR. HAVE BEEN STRONGLY PUSHING THE STAFF AND THEY HAVE BEEN ACTING. WORKING HARD I THINK THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS AND THAT THE CPC. AFRICAN UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE- WE ARE. AYE SO FOR EXAMPLE IS ADVOCATING THAT THE CPUC REYES. THE RESERVE MARGIN FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT. PRECISELY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT IN SIGHT. WE ALSO I THINK NEED TO DO SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY HAVE. MENTIONED I'M GONNA LET HER CONTRAST WORK IN MORE DETAIL. WHICH IS WE HAVE TO FOCUS. ON NOT THE TRADITIONAL AFTERNOON PEAK BUT IN THE EVENING WHEN THE SUN IS DOWN HOW WE CAN MANAGE TO MAINTAIN THE FACT THAT DURING A HEAT WAVE. PEOPLE DO NOT TURN OFF THE AIR CONDITIONING JUST BECAUSE THE SUN HAS GONE DOWN IT REMAINS HOT- AND THAT IS CERTAINLY VERY VERY MUCH OUR FOCUS. AND I THINK. ALL COURT ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA OUR PRIMARY. SIMPLY FOCUS BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT SUMMER IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ADDRESS THIS YOUR CONF VERY REASONABLE CONCERNS. AND THANK YOU FOR RAISING THOSE ISSUES SENATOR HERTZBERG WE ARE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER WITH YOU SEE IN THE CITY'S G. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT AND WE HAVE- I'M GOING MEETINGS WITH SHE SHE YOU SEE AN ISO METER SHOP ON BOARD LEVEL AS WELL. TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES WHERE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE ALIGNMENT PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES AND THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL WITH THE SAME OBJECTIVES. ARE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ALSO NEED TO BE AWARE OFF WITH THE EVENING BECAUSE ASH MENTIONED. IS HAVING MORE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW US TO MEET THE EVENING PEAK AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY ACHIEVED UP TO A LARGE EXTENT WITH EXTENDING THE ONE STRUGGLING. WE DON'T WANT TO RETIRE PLANS AHEAD OF TIME BEFORE WE HAVE TECHNOLOGIES TO REPLACE THEM WITH ANY OF THE SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO INSTALLING MORE STORAGE ON THE GRID. IN FACT I WAS AT THE RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY VIRTUAL LIKE THIS ONE- EARLIER THIS WEEK- IN LONG BEACH HERE ARE WITH A YES WHERE WE UNVEILED A HUNDRED. A HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE FACILITY CUTTING EDGE THE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HOW ARE FOR FOUR HOURS CONTINUOUSLY SO SUCH TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALLOW US TO BETTER OPERATE THE GREATER VERY IMPORTANT. AND I BELIEVE THAT NOT WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS ON THE GROUND WE WILL HAVE OVER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS BY THE SUMMER WHICH SHOULD HELP US WIDE SUBSTANTIALLY. IN MEETING THAT EVENING RAIMES AND ENSURING THAT WE CAN RELIABLY OPERATE THE GRANT ESPECIALLY IN THE EXTREME CONDITIONS. THAT RAMP IS GOING TO CONTINUE IT IS INITIAL FOR US THAT WE MEET WITH GAS. IMPORTS WILL MEET WITH STORAGE WE NEED TO ENHANCE FLEXIBILITY WENEED TO PULL DEMAND ENERGY RESOURCES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE CUSTOMERS THAT OWN TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS- PERSONAL STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES EVEN ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A MARKET THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SUPPORT THE GRANT. AND MONETIZE THEIR INCENTIVES. BECAUSE BLACKS ORIGIN GREAT AND WE LOVE THEM AND WE NEED MORE OF THAT. BUT WE ALSO KNEW TO BE ABLE TO MARKET BECAUSE- PER. SO IT SHOULD ALL HAVE ON THAT. VERY CLOSE FOR. TO ENSURE THAT WE- RELY ALL OF TO GROW. THE OURS OUR ECONOMY. MAINTAIN OUR INVITE. AND I COME LEADERS. PROVIDE YOU WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE- WITH THESE TO COME. AS WE- BUT MOST ALL OPERATE RELIABLE INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT. BECAUSE MAKE ONE FINAL POINT OKAY YEAH I THINK IT'S A IMPORTANT IT REALLY CONCERNS ME. YOU KNOW BACK WHEN WE HAD THE ENERGY CRISIS AND WALLY MCGUIRE WAS RUNNING. HE REMEMBER HIM HE WAS WRITING FLEXURE POWER THE MESSAGE WE WERE SENDING EVERYBODY IS TURN YOUR WASHER YOUR DRYER OFF DURING THE DAY. AND DO IT AT NIGHT WHEN THE LOAD WAS DOWN NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE SOLAR AND SOMETIMES WHEN DURING THE DAY WE'RE GETTING A GREATER ELEMENT OF POWER THE DUCK CURVE AND ALL THOSE ISSUES. AND SO NOW WE'VE GOT THE LOAD RAMP AT NIGHT. THE BUILDING I WOULD I JUST WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD THAT I MENTION TO BOTH OF YOU THAT I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO WATCH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUE RESOURCE ADEQUACY. ED AND YOU KNOW THIS A CHAIR GLIB TO VOTE BUT FROM FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AND I KNOW THAT FROM WORKING WITH YOU. THAT SOLAR SILICON BASED SOLAR STARTS TO DEGRADE AT SEVENTY SEVEN DEGREES. ARE THERE SOME EXPECTATIONS FROM OUR EXPERTS HERE IN THE SENATE WITH WHOM WE CONSULTED WITH STAFF BEFORE THIS HEARING TO HELP PREPARE THAT THEY EXPECT IS WE COULD HAVE TEMPERATURES MUCH AS A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES. SO NOW YOU HAVE THE MID DAY YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO PREPARE FOR THE EVENING RAMP WITH THE EXPECTATION YOU'RE RUNNING ELECTRONS DURING THE DAY. AND THAT COULD BE SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE THE POWER THAT YOU'RE SICK YOU'RE RELYING ON WHICH HAS BEEN PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY AND SOLAR WILL DRAMATICALLY BE REDUCED WHICH FURTHER THAN PUTS US AT RISK FOR BLACKOUTS AND I JUST. YOU KNOW ONLY RAISE THIS BECAUSE WE FROM OUR EXPERTS AND THE STAFF THAT WE'VE TALKED TO A CONSULTED WITH IN THE SENATE. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE PREPARED BECAUSE WE CAN'T TAKE THIS RISK I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SHORE MAKE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. WHEN THE HOMEWORK THAT WE'VE. DONE HERE WITH OUR OWN. OF PEOPLES. YES IT I'M ABSOLUTELY. ANYBODY JUST ADD WE NEED TO BE. WITH CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASING TEMPERATURES AND WE MAY SEE VARIATION NOT ONLY IN SEOUL. SOLAR MAY REACH. YOUR FOUR BY 10% OR- MORE DEPENDING ON THE TEMPERATURES AND WE SEE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES IN RIYADH IN THE DESERT AND OTHER LOCATIONS. WIND DOESN'T ALWAYS BLOW I MEAN WE WHAT WE COULD HAVE A CLOUD COVER. AND ALSO WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THEY MAY BE A REDUCTION IN HARD RESOURCES WHICH WE DEPEND ON FROM THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. SO WE ARE TAKING ALL THIS INTO ACCOUNT. AND ENSURING THAT WE BOUGHT ALL THE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. AND ALL OF THE RESOURCES STOCK IN ORDER SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE. THAT WE'VE GOT ENOUGH ON THE BREAD. TO PROVIDE RELIABLE SERVICE THROUGH THOSE DIFFICULT THANKS. AND I'M TAKING CLIMATE CHANGE INTO ACCOUNT. IT'S GOING TO AFFECT ALL OF US. THANK YOU THANK YOU- AND SENATOR YOU NOT IF YOU HAVE OTHER. LATER WILL COME BACK TO YOU THIS IS IMPORTANT CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T HAD CONNECT A YESTERDAY BUT I FIGURED WHAT I HAD TO. ASK WOULD BE SIMPLE TO THEM. TO RESPOND TO I DO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS IT- THE MAJORITY LEADER HAS. OVER THIS ISSUE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TURNING THE I SO WHEN I WAS SO IMPRESSED. WITH EVERYTHING AND HOW IT OPERATES AND- GOSH ALL THE DIGITAL SCREENS AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU GUYS HAVE THEIR- IT WAS FRANKLY WAY OVER MY HEAD BUT I DID UNDERSTAND ONE THING THE DUCK CURVE THAT WAS- DESCRIBED AS AN IT TALKED ABOUT THE RAMP UP PERIOD THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE. AND HOW RAMPING UP IN THE EVENING IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN THIS DISCUSSION WAS TAKING PLACE WAS. SEVERELY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE AND STILL MAINTAIN POWER AND IT WAS GETTING HARDER TO ACHIEVE NOW THAT'S WHAT STAFF TOLD ME AT THAT TIME AND BASED ON THE RESPONSE THAT YOU JUST GAVE THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS. AND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAJOR POWER PLANTS COMING OFFLINE ONE OF THOSE PLANTS PRODUCES ABOUT. 10% OF THE STATE'S ENERGY AND TWENTY PERCENT. OF ONE I'LL USE ENERGY THAT PROVIDES POWER TO THE STATE TO OUR RESIDENTS- I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR COMMENTS AND JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT IS STILL A CONCERN OF YOURS- YOU KNOW RAMPING UP AND HAVING AND AFFORDABLE POWER. AT NIGHT BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE. ABOUT REPLACING THE ENERGY TO SOON GOING TO BE COMING OFF LINE AND COULD CREATE MORE OF A BLACKOUTS OR BROWNOUTS REALLY BROWN- BLACKOUT SITUATION THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCED. LAST FALL- LAST SUMMER. SO I THINK. IT'S CERTAINLY A CONCERN IN THE SENSE THAT WERE VERY MUCH AWARE THAT WE'RE LOSING SIGNIFICAN AMOUNTS GENERATION. IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS- AND WE NEED TO START PLANNING. ABSOLUTELY TODAY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REPLACE THAT WITH RESOURCES THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE. WHEN YOU NEED TO. AND FIND AGAIN I THINK FLEXIBILITY IS THE KEY RELATED RESOURCES THAT CAN GO UP AND DOWN- WHAT THOSE RESOURCES WILL BE IS GOING TO BE A CONVERSATION. BETWEEN THE AYE SO IN THE CPC. CPC HAVE ALTERNATE JURISDICTION OVER THESE ISSUES. BUT YES WE'RE VERY MUCH AWARE. AND AGAIN I STATE MY OWN VIEW ON THIS IS THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS. IN THE WORLD OF FINANCE THE DIVERSE PORTFOLIO IS THE WAY TO REDUCE RISK. AND THE SAME IS TRUE AN ENERGY. THAT IS I MEAN REALLY PUTTING ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET IS NEVER GONNA BE THE SOLUTION WE'RE GONNA NEED. EVERYTHING'S SHORT TERM STORAGE LONG TERM STORAGE. DIFFERENT KINDS OF RESOURCES OFFSHORE WIND HYDROELECTRIC NOT HYDROGEN CIRCLE OF SOME HYDRO I MEAN IT'S JUST THEIR DESK BURDEN YOU DON'T REQUIRE TO HAVE TO FOCUS. ON THE ENTIRE GAMUT OF THINGS WE COULD GET. THANK YOU. I WOULD ONLY ADD ONE SMALL ITEM THAT IS NOT ONLY THE FLEXIBILITY ON THE PEAK AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT WE HAVE TO MEET THAT WE'RE ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED ON IS ASHLAND SHIN AND NEED THE VALUABLE RESOURCES IN THE FOURTH FOLIOS. AND THE TECHNOLOGIES TO ALLOW US TO MEET BACKGROUND WHICH STORAGE IS SPECIALLY LONG TERM UTILITY SCALE STORAGE. BUT ALSO WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT THAT THERE WE OPERATIONAL INDEPENDENT RIGHT NOW AND YOU NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT A FEW. LOCAL OUT MOSTLY DAYS- THAT DO NOT ALLOW US TO HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO CHARGE TH BATTERIES MAKE CALLS ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS. QUICKLY INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS OFFSHORE WIND WHICH ACTUALLY COMPLEMENTS THE EVENING PEAK QUITE NICELY WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR US. AND ALSO MORE STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES TO ALLOW US TO OPERATE FOR A FEW DAYS. AFTER DANCE AROUND I'M RELIABLE SOLAR RESOURCES DIVERSIFICATION. ON AN ACCELERATED SCHEDULE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIR RAY THE L. THE IF ANY HELLO WITH TO BE PHASED OUT BEFORE WE ARE WITH A THE TO START PICKING UP FOR THAT LOST THAT EVERYONE IS AWARE THIS IS AN ISSUE. THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THE GOOD CAUSE OPERATIONAL. DIFFICULTIES IF IT'S TAKEN OFF LINE I HAVE I HAD ALMOST THE APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES COMING ONLINE. THANK YOU MA'AM I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE VERY MUCH- I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. CURRENTLY THE AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL- ELECTRICITY IN THREE CALIFORNIA I- USE I ARE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE- HOW'S THE COW I ESTá WORKING WITH THE C. P. U. C. AND THE C. E. C. TO ADDRESS THE HIGH ELECTRICITY RATES THAT CALIFORNIANS PAY TODAY. I DON'T TO TRICKLE. TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT. ARMENIANS YES BOOK BURNINGS DO WE DO HAVE A HIGHER RATE FOR ELECTRICITY CALIFORNIANS PAY YOUR BILL AND I WERE BILLS TAKEN ON AVERAGE WITH THE NATIONAL I'M PRETTY MUCH IN THE MIDDLE WE ARE NOT THE HIGHEST BILLS THAT THAT CUSTOMERS DO PAY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN INFLUENCE THE RACHEL RAY FERRIS RASPY TRANSMISSION ACCESS CHARGE THE B. EYES SO CHARGERS. WE HAVE ACTUALLY MAINTAIN NOT AN OPTION I'M SURE IF YOU'RE THE CHAIR ALL OF OUR FINANCE COMMITTEE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS WITH THE PRETTY STABLE FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND ALSO D. E. I AM HAS BROUGHT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA OUR REPAIRS WITH RESPECT TO THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE I. S. OKAY AND ONE THAT RUSSIAN OF THE BILL THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SERVICES WE EITHER HAVE TO HAPPEN RIGHT- WE'VE BROUGHT IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN OPERATE MORE RELIABLY AND BRING MORE BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA AND NOT ONLY ARE WE OPERATING THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET WE'RE DON'T HAVE ALSO BECOME THE RELIABILITY COORDINATOR FOR THE LAST WHITE RIGHT- WE ARE VERY PROUD OF HAVING TAKEN. DOT INITIATIVE AS WELL AND THAT WILL BRING ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE COGNIZANT THAT OUR PEOPLE PAY A BILL WITH STANDS THAT OUR SERVICES ARE PART OF THE REACH THAT THEY PAY AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WATCH THOSE AND KEEP THEM LOW. WE DO EVERYTHING. WHATEVER THINKS THAT IS THAT. WE HAVE. DO WE HAVE THE I. DOES NOT CAN THE MIX OF RESEARCH OF THE IN CAL. BUT WE DO OPERATE MARKET I MEAN THAT'S THE BOOK UP OTHER THE RELIABLE WHICH IS FIRST FOREMOST WE UP A MARKER WHICH IS THE WE TO REESE BASED ON LEAST COST POSSIBLE AND THAT ALSO DEBT THAT'S IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO KEEPING BILLS DOWN-AND IT AND IT'S JUST THAT THAT'S- THAT IS THAT IS ONE OF OUR CORE FUNCTIONS. KAMALA AGAIN SECOND ONLY TO RELIABILITY. THANK YOU BOTH FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. THERE'S THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE I CENTER LAYERED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- HE I REALLY APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH BOTH CANDIDATES HERE AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT IT WAS IS IT'S RARE WHEN YOU HAVE THESE MEETINGS THAT YOU WISH YOU COULD KEEP GOING AND THAT IS CLEARLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH IT AND I AND MANY OF THE THINGS- YOU. YOU SATISFACTORILY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET SOME OF IT ON THE RECORD THAT HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS OUT IN THE OPEN AND I'D LIKE TO PICK UP ON A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM EACH OF THE ARE THE PREVIOUS. AND ONE IS YOU MENTIONED BATTERY STORAGE OR YOU MENTIONED STORAGE BUT OUR OUR AND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT IN MY DISTRICT OF FOSSIL FUEL PLANT IN MOSS LANDING HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO TWO BIG BATTERY STORAGE ENOUGH PROPOSED FOR THE FORMER PLANT AND MORAL BAY AND- OUR OF WHAT DO YOU THINK. ARE ARE. ARE THE GAINS THAT WERE ABOUT TO MAKE IN BATTERY STORAGE BUT WHERE DOES THAT JUST LEAVE US WHY DOES THAT. MATTER THAT SLIM COMFORT GIVEN THE OVERALL LOOK AT THE PICTURE YOU'RE DESCRIBING. WHAT I'M SORRY I'M NOT I'M NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OF FACILITATION I'M JUST TOO WRAPPED UP IN THE CONVERSATIO SO- GO RIGHT AHEAD AND- EITHER CAN JUMP IN AT EITHER POINT UNLESS THE MEMBER I'D DIRECTS A QUESTION TO ONE OF YOU SPECIFICALLY SO I'LL JUST SORRY FOR THAT- BUT GO RIGHT AHEAD TO POINT OUT VERY QUICKLY THAT IT MAY BE SLIM COMFORT. ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE A TREMENDOUS HELP AND HAVING THAT ALMOST TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF BATTERY STORAGE WHICH IS VERY FLEXIBLE AND CAN RAMP UP QUICKLY. AND PROVIDES A PLACE FOR HOURS OF POWER WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THIS. IS A GREAT RESOURCE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE FOR US TO DO A LOT OF SHIFTING. WE'RE ALSO SEEING BACKGROUND LAST BEFORE HOURS- THREE TO FOUR HOURS EVERY EVENING EVERY DAY WHICH IS CURRENTLY AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. BY TWENTY THIRTY AS WE TRANSITION TO MORE RENEWABLES ON THE GRID. THAT RAMP IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS SO WE NEED MORE STORAGE WE NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY WE NEED MORE GENERATION THE CAN RAMP UP QUICKLY. AND WE EVEN PEAK DEMAND AND ALLOW US TO RUN THROUGH THOSE FOUR HOURS. AND AS WE DO CARBONIZED NEED TO BE LOOKING AT MORE AND A VARIETY OF RESOURCES YOU. SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT. WELL AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP QUICKLY. I MEAN I'M OBVIOUSLY A LAY PERSON BUT I KNOW THAT NIGHT IS LONGER THAN THREE OR FOUR HOURS. SO HOW HOW DOES THAT HANDLE IT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE SOLAR FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME. WE HAVE. YES KNOW. IT DOES- I THINK THIS IS WHAT I MEANT ABOUT DIVERSITY. IS THAT- BATTERY STORE FOR BATTERY STORAGE. HELPS WITH ONE IS. BUT IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE- A- HOW DO WE- THE LIGHTS ON AT NIGHT AND THAT'S WHERE DIVERSITY TO FIRST PORTFOLIO IS SO IMPORTANT. IS FOR NOW WE ARE STILL. WILL HAVE HIGH DRUG WE HAVE HYDRO WILL HAVE A HYDRO. AND WATER OBVIOUSLY RUNS THE NIGHT OR DAY- AND WE'LL HAVE SOME WIND BECAUSE THE WIND ALSO DOES NOT ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE SUN. BUT WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT OTHER RESOURCE- AND THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THIS INCLUDING ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK AT SERIOUSLY CONSIDER IS MORE LONG TERM UTILITY SCALE STORAGE- BECAUSE THAT IS. SOMETHING THAT REALLY ESPECIALLY IF COUPLED WITH OTHERS WITH CLEAN POWER TO CHARGE. IS ANOTHER RESOURCE THAT WE CAN USE BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NO SINGLE THING THAT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE- FOR EXAMPLE BATTERIES ALSO CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S CLOUDY FOR FIVE. I'M THAT'S NOT YET WHAT HAPPENS EVEN IN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE CLOUDY WEATHER. AND OBVIOUSLY A FOUR HOUR BATTERY IS NOT A REALLY IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THAT PARTICULAR CHALLENGE. AND THEN LET ME FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION THAT SENATOR GROVE PASSED IT AND THAT'S THAT HE TALKED ABOUT THE POWER PLANTS GOING OFFLINE AND ONE OF THE BIG ONES IN MY DISTRICT ABLOH CANYON AND WHEN I TOURED THAT PLANT. ONE OF THE FASCINATING THINGS I LEARNED AS ONCE IT RAMPS UP IT RAMPS UP AT THAT LEVEL FOR SEVEN DAYS THEY THEY THEY CAN'T CHANGE IT AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT RENEWABLES WERE BEING REJECTED ON THE GRID. BECAUSE YOU JUST HAD THIS POWER COMING AT A NON REGULATED LEVEL OUT OF TO HAVE LOW CANYON. AND YOU'RE EXACTLY THE AND I MEANT TO ASK YOU THIS THE OTHER DAY YOUR THE ONES THAT. WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD ON REGULATING THE POWER HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT WHEN THAT HAPPENS. WELL FOR NOW DO. CANYON YES YES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND IT'S BASED LOW POWER BUT WE DON'T NEED AS MUCH BASEBALL'S POWER IT'S SYSTEM POWER WE DON'T NEED IT IS NOT A CONSTRAINED EVERY YEAR FOR LIABILITY THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT AS CRITICAL. BUT ALSO IT'S NOT FLEXIBLE AS YOU SAID IT IS A VERY INFLEXIBLE RESOURCE THAT WHEN YOU RAMP IT UP WE WRAP IT DOWN IT STAYS THERE FOR DAYS. AND WE NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO RENT AND REGGIE UP AND DOWN. THE FOUR HOURS ARE IMPORTANT AT THE END OF THE DAY BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG THE PEAK LAST AFTER NINE PM- HOW YOU STARTS TO GRADUALLY GO DOWN AND IT'S PRETTY LEVEL TOWARDS THAT THE WHOLE EVENING HOURS. SO PROVIDING BASELOAD ENERGY. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN BE CARBON FREE IS OF COURSE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED. TO BE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE WHEN THREE NEW BOWLS WE KNOW THAT WE CAN OPERATE A RELIABLE BRENT. IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE HOURS OF OPERATION IN CERTAIN DAYS OVER 90% OF OUR COUNTRY AND REGENERATE NOBLES. AND WE KNOW THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN RELIABILITY DIS IDEAL CONDITIONS. THE NAME OF THE GAME THOUGH YES MAINTAINED THAT RELIABILITY WITH LOW CARBON TECHNOLOGIES. EVERY SINGLE DAY EVERY SINGLE HOUR AND SPECIALLY TOWARDS. EVENING PEAK SO. I'M DIVERSE CITY WORKERS LIABLE. IN TURN OF HAVING TECHNOLOGIES AND- TECHNOLOGY YOUR PARTICULARS POINT OUT THANK LEAD US LONG. THREE OR FOUR DAYS. ALMOST ALL LEARNED SO- AND OPERATE THE GRAY. IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US IN CERTAINLY FOLKS ON IT. AND IF YOU. IF YOU HAVE OFFSHORE WIND A RADICALLY IN THE SAME REGION- AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT CAN BALANCE THINGS OUT. HOW DOES THAT ET INTO THE GRID ASIDE FROM WHAT I MEAN DO YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN THE CITING. A HOW DO YOU DECIDE HOW TO ADD THAT INTO THE SYSTEM IN THE RIGHT WHY. TO DO IT. DON'T YOU JUST I'M SORRY. OKAY JOINT TO SEARCH BECAUSE THE OTHER COMMISSION AS A INSIDE. THE CPC ADAM IN PRETTY. BUT WE- DECIDE WHAT TRANSMISSION PRAGUE WE HAVE TO APPROVE NEW TRANSMISSION PROJECTS. IF IN FACT FOR EXAMPLE OFFSHORE WIND BURKE A GOAL IN IN A SPOT WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE. LOTS OF TRANSMISSION MOST OBVIOUSLY A JOB YEAH WHAT CANYON WE CAN REUSE THAT TRANSMISSION THE TRANSMISSION IT USED TO BE USED TO BRING THE OUTLETS ENERGY TO THE STATE CAN BE USED TO BRING WET. THERE ARE OTHER LOCATIONS THAT. WE WOULD NEED TO BUILD NEW TRANSMISSION FOR ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH MARKET THERE WERE THE HUMBOLDT ONE WHICH IS THE OTHER OPPORTUNITY YOU'VE GOT TO BUILD NEW TRANSMISSION. YES BECAUSE THERE WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH BUILT ALREADY ESTABLISH TRANSMISSION AND SO. AND OF COURSE THERE ARE YOUR- ISSUES GOING INTO OFFSHORE WIND ARE BEYOND MY EXPERTISE. THINGS LIKE GRAPHICALLY WHAT'S POSSIBLE. ISSUES I GATHER THERE ISSUES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEMAND SO IT'S A MULTI LAYER PROBLEM PARKING WHAT IS ABOUT WHAT THE WHAT THE EXPENSE WOULD BE A BUILDING TRANSMISSION. OR USING AN EXISTING TRANSMISSION AT THAT POINT I KNOW WILL BE FACING A COUPLE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS THIS YEAR ON THE SUN. AND LASTLY LET ME ASK THE LAKE QUESTIONED THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT I THINK. SOME. PEOPLE THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND THE AYE SO. TELL US WHY. WE JUST HAPPENED IN TECH. IN RELATION TO HOW THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE GRID WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE SAME WAY IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE WAY WE ARE CONNECTED TO THE WESTERN STATES. WELLYES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION WE ARE WE AREN'T AS AS I POINTED OUT WE DO HAVE THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND WE ARE INTERCONNECTED TO OTHER STATES. CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY CEMENT IMPORTER OF OURS SO WE USED TO IMPORTING EXPECTS BOARDING ENERGY AND OPTIMIZING THAT EXPORT. TAXES IS ISOLATED BUT HAVE ALWAYS BEATEN IRELAND IN AN OFF THEIR OWN THEY DO NOT ALLOW POWER TO COME IN AND THEY ALSO DO NOT EXPORT OUR- THERE ARE SMALL AREAS OF TEXAS AND THE PANHANDLE AND- ALSO WHERE THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED CHIU SURROUNDING BRANCH AND THOSE AREAS ACTUALLY HAVE POWER THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS. BUT I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE SAW IN TEXAS WAS A SITUATION WHERE ONE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESERVE MARGINS THEY AREN'T REQUIRED TO DO THAT SO THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY WAS NOT THERE. I ALSO DID NOT FOLLOW FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS WHICH WERE WHICH WERE RECOMMENDATIONS TO INSULATE THEIR EQUIPMENT SO WE SAW A MASSIVE THING. CROSS THE BOARD OF I'M JUST REACHING FOR THE NATURAL GAS INSTRUMENTS FREEZING FOR THE NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGIES I DON'T KNOW IF ALL ELSE FREEZING SO THEY COULDN'T ACTUALLY USE THE CALL AS EFFICIENTLY AS WELL. WE ALL HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE WINDMILLS THE WINDOWS IS ACTUALLY A MYTH WINDOWS- OPERATE RELIABLY AND VERY COLD TEMPERATURES THEY OPERATED ARCTIC IN THE NORTHERN ST THEY OPERATE IN ARE YOU WELL. IN FACT IN IOWA MIDAMERICAN ENERGY RUNS A 100% THE WIND POWER AND THEY'RE ABLE TO BALANCE THAT RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THE GREAT ARE NEEDED WESTERN MARKET THE MY SHOP. SO TAXES ACTUALLY HURT THEMSELVES BY NOT PARTICIPATING IN AN INTEGRATED- CAPABILITY OF BRINGING EMPOWER AND ACTUALLY OPTIMIZING THEIR OWN EXPORT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALLOWING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO FAIL AND NOT BEEFING UP INSULATING AND RATHER RISING RECOMMEND AS NECESSARY. TO BE ABLE TO OPEATE RELIABLY. THANK YOU ARE YOU CAN SEE WHY I HAD CUTTING OFF THE CA. WHEN I READING WITH THEM A AND YOUR- SPEAKS. I'M GOING TO BE PLEASE TO SERVE YOU BOTH THANK YOU MAY CHAIR. EARLIER THANK I CAN'T OF A MORE INFO TOP OF TO. SO OF YOU KNOW TYPICALLY I KNOW THAT WE MOVE A LOT FASTER SOMETIMES BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S ALWAYS. NECESSARY WE'RE HERE TO DO A JOB AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THOSE OF US THAT. YOU KNOW I LOOK TO THE SENATORS WHO SEEMINGLY HAVE MORE IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THIS TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. SENATOR BATES OUT LAST BUT NOT LEAST I GAVE YOU A REPRIEVE HAVE BEEN. BUT BUT ALL HAVE NOT BEEN ASKING THAT IS THE SAME WAY WHO MADE THAT STATEMENT ANYWAY. RIGHT GO AHEAD SENATOR BABYFACE THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE FUND WHAT IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX FONG. AGENCY AN ASSIGNMENT- I THINK FROM THE CONVERSATION I JUST HAD ENERGY WHEN A ONE BECAUSE- I LIKE THE CONSTITUENTS WHO DON'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND I ALSO THE GREED AND ALL OF THAT BUT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF US STUDY OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS HOUSE THIS. APPOINTMENT PROCEDURE CAME FORWARD. MY CONCERN IS THAT I THINK THAT OUR ENERGY- PLANNING IS REALLY HAMPERED BY THIS RATHER INTRICATE AND EXPANSIVE BUREAUCRACY THAT OVERSEES IT TRYING TO FIND ACCOUNTABILITY. I TRYING TO FIND GOALS DELIVERABLES VERY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE EACH AGENCY WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT I SERVED ON GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S. WE COMMITTEE HE WANT TO BLOW UP THE BOXES BECAUSE HE FELT THERE WAS TOO MUCH STYLING THAT WENT ON THROUGHOUT OUR GOVERNMENT AND I THINK THE ENERGY SITUATION HERE REALLY IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF WHY THINGS. KIND OF GO AWRY OF MY CONCERN LET ME I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ACTUALLY- THAT DEAL WITH. THE OVERSIGHT NUMBER ONE YOU FALL ON THE RELIABILITY ISSUE I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE TO BE DIALED MORE INTO THEIR FUND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN I ALSO. IN P. YOU SEE IS WHERE IT BEGINS AND ENDS IN TERMS OF THE RELIABILITY AND WHAT IS AVAILABLE WHEN WE HIT THOSE PIZZA ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT WE GET SOMETHING DIRECTLY FROM ISEL IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE NEEDS IN TERMS OF THE AREAS YOU SAID WE NEED MORE STORAGE WE MEAN NEED MORE DIVERSITY. AND WE NEED MORE COORDINATION AND OVERSIGHT AMONGST ALL OF THE AGENCIES ARE INVOLVED- YOU KNOW ENSURING THAT OUR- CONSTITUENTS HAVE THE ENERGY THAT THEY NEED TO- THE POWER THAT THEY NEED TO- FOR THEIR LIVES OUT THERE. ACROSS THE SPECTRUM SO THAT'S THE DELIVERABLE I'D LIKE TO SEE US RECEIVE OF MADAME POOLE TOWN A VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE OF THE- THINGS THAT CAME OUT YOU KNOW SO THERE WAS A REVIEW BY THE ISO CEO AND HE SAID HE HAD WARNED THE PC FOR YEARS ABOUT THE ENACT INADEQUATE. POWER SUPPLY PLANNING DURING THE NET PEAK IN SUMMER THAT COULD LEAD TO POWER OUTAGES YET THAT KIND OF ESCAPE TO HOLD OFF UNTIL THAT HE HAD TO- THIS LAST SUMMER. O I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. NUMBER. TWO WE ARE TO MOVE TO. THE ELECT VEHICLE MANDATE BY TWENTY. I JUST USING THE FIGURES THAT CAME OUT FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION OF THE STATE NEEDS OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLIONMORE CHARGERS. AT A POTENTIAL COST OF THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S JUST THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOES NOT COVER THE COST TO UPGRADE THE GRID. TO HANDLE ALL THOSE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF CAL AYE SO HAS DONE ANY SORT OF STUY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE GRID INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE. AND IT WHAT IT WILL COST TO MEET ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY ELECTRICAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE GOAL. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING OUT YOU KNOW BACK TO THE RELIABILITY OF THE GRID AND HOW WE GET ALL THAT TO ADDITIONAL. A POWER- TO RUN THE STATE IS CERTAINLY TO BE AVAILABLE AT THESE CHARGING STATIONS. TO KEEP OUR STATE MOVING. SO I'LL TOSS THAT TO YOU AND SEE IF YOU CAN SHARE IN IN RIGHT NOW SIGN. HOW WE WILL MEET THAT GOAL. ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED BOTH ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE PROVISION OF THE LAW THE POWER THAT'S NEEDED. FOR A HUGE STATE THAT STILL COMMUTES MAINLY. OF I. R. TWO. SO HE SAID HE THANK SENATOR- ABOUT WHAT YOU START AND- AND THEN WE'LL GO. BACK TO MR BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR AND YES WE'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE A REPORT ON HOW WE CAN BETTER COORDINATE TOGETHER AND ACROSS THE BOARD AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE HAVE MADE. IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. WORKING FROM THE SAME PLAYBOOK AND ADDRESSING THE ISSUES IN A CONSISTENT MANNER ACROSS THE BOARD AND ACROSS AGENCIES AND WORKING IN COLLABORATION. WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE ALWAYS LOOK AT ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND ELECTRIFICATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IN ORDER TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA A VEHICLE AND MOBILE SOURCE RELATED. WHICH MEANS WE NEED TO BE WORKING EVEN MORE CLOSELY WITH THE CC BECAUSE THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF MOBILE RESOURCE. I'M THE MANDATE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS VERY EXCITING AND IT CAN. BE A HUGE HELP TO. OR CAN HURT DEPENDING ON HOW AND THOSE VEHICLES STRONG. SO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT AS WE ROLL OUT THE LUXURY VEHICLES WE ARE COGNIZANT OF THE FACT. THAT IF ALL THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE START CHARGING AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN WE'VE GOT THAT EVENING BROWN- THEY MAY ACTUALLY HURT THE GRANT SO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN INSULATE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THAT HAPPENING. AND STANDS SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY STATIONS SIGNALS ON MONETARY SIGNALS TO CUSTOMERS NOT TO CHARGE DURING THOSE PERIODS THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT MEDIUM AND LARGE SCALE JUDY VEHICLES. AS WE CONTINUE TO DECARBONISE THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO HELP THE GRANT AND HELP COMMUNITIES WITH THE FINDER ACTUAL CHARGING. SO DURING PEAK TIME WE WILL BE ABLE TO DRAW POWER FROM THE BATTERIES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE GRANT. AND ALL THESE VEHICLES DISTRIBUTOR THROUGH ALL CALIFORNIA WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE HOW THE CAPABILITY TO INCREASE BRAND RELIABILITY IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY OPERATED RIGHT AND IF WE MANAGE TO ENSURE. THAT WE DON'T HAVE- DISTURBANCE AT THE END OF THE DAY OR WHEN WE'VE GOT PEAK OF CONSTRAINT GREAT CONDITIONS. AND WE WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE THOSE VEHICLES CHARGING AT THAT TIME BUT WOULD RATHER BE PULLING ENERGY FROM THEM. AND BECAUSE VEHICLES ARE PRETTY MUCH PAR 480% OF THE TIME WE DO HAVE THAT BY DIRECTIONAL CHARGING CAPABILITY. IT ACTUALLY CAN HELP THE GRANT AND HAVING AN EXCESS AMOUNT OF ENERGY ON THE GROUND WITH RESPECT TO MORE SOLAR AND RENEWABLES. BUT WE SOMETIMES CARTEL DURING THE TIME OF DAY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO ACT TO STRENGTHEN. CHARGING THOSE VEHICLES AND CHARGING BATTERIES EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT- DESALINATION PROJECT AS WELL AS STRINGS. AND MOVING TOWARDS FUEL CELL VEHICLES WHICH ALSO ELECTRIC IF WE MAKE THE HYDROGEN WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY AND BALANCE THE EXCESS AMOUNT OF RENEWABLES. THAT WAY AS WELL. BUT LAST IMPORTANTLY DO NEED TO HAVE. YOU PLACE CORD. THE HABITS- AND CHARGING INTEREST TO BE CHARGED NINETY NINE OR THE MIDDLE THANK WELL WE'VE GOT ACCESS. AND IT WON'T COST GRANT. SO BACK NICE YOU'RE RIGHT. IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL AND WHEN HE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- WE ARE NOT SURE OR- IN THE FOOT BY ATTRACT. THE TRUMP. SECTOR BUT IN FACT THEY'RE TAKING. OF THE SYMBIOTIC OUR POTENTIAL OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES HELPING THE GRANT AND HELPING GREAT OPERATION ALLOWING. US TO INTEGRATE MORE RENEWABLES. IT'S WHAT I WANT TO GO I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING ACTUALLY SENT- APOLOGIZE ADD TO THE IS. TECHNOLOGY HAS IGNORE POTENTIAL HERE- I'M HARD JOB HI SO IS TO BUILD MARKETS. AND BUILD OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR. TO PARTICIPATE AND FROM FOR EXAMPLE THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO OPERATE BATTERIES UP AND DOWN BOTH HOME BATTERIES AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY SO THAT THEIR PROVIDING POWER INTO THE GRID. DURING OF TIMES WHEN WE NEED IT AND THEN CHARGING WHEN WE HAVE EXCESS POWER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY RETOOL- DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES FOR INTEGRATING AMOUNT TO THE GREAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRIORITIES AT THE AYE SO FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BUT IT'S THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO STEP IN. AND THEY'RE STARTING TO PEOPLE LIKE TESLA ARE STARTING TO STEP IN AND ACTUALLY BECAUSE FOR THEM IT'S A MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY IT'S NOT JUST THAT OF. THEM I WOULD EXPECT I WOULD BUSINESSES I WOULD EXPECT THEM TO OPERATE FROM PROFIT. MOTIVE OUR TRICK IS TO MAKE IT PROFITABLE. I GUESS I SEE THAT. pTHAT AN INDIVIDUAL FACES WHEN WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A- HUGE HEAT WAVE DO I'D CHARGE MY CAR OR DO YOU LIVE. HE LEAVE THEIR CONDITIONING ON. BECAUSE I CAN'T SURVIVE THROUGH THE NIGHT WITHOUT IT SO. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE- HUGE ISSUES THAT REQUIRE A TREMENDOUS EDUCATION. OF OUR FOLKS OUT THERE. WHO THINK IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY EASY WITH AN ELECTRIC CAR JUST TO PLUG IT INTO YOUR GARAGE ABOUT WHEN THE ENTIRE POPULATION. WHO THE **** ARE COMMUTERS IN THEIR OWN AUTOMOBILES ARE TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING- WE SURELY NEED TO BE IN FRONT OF THAT YEARS AND FRIEND OF TWENTY THIRTY. AND I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH CONVERSATION OR HEARD MUCH CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. SO A LOT OF CHALLENGES THAT YOU ALL HAVE SERVING ON THE BOARD I WILL BE VERY FRANK I TODAY I'M NOT PREPARED. PREPARED TO SUPPORT ARE YOU I NEED TO HAVE MORE. REAL I NEED RELIABILITY THAT YOU HAVE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE DELIVERABLES THAT ARE ALREADY PART OF WHAT IS BEING PLANNED AND- TO BE PROVIDED TO OUR LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF TALK. ABOUT NEEDING TECHNOLOGY THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TANGIBLE THAT I'VE SEEN. AND I'M NOT SERVING ON THE ENERGY COMMISSION- COMMITTEE SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME. THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ARE. DISTRIBUTED TO THE DEGREE I THINK IT'S VERY VERY NECESSARY AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THAT I COMMAND YOU YOU'VE BEEN BOTH SERVING OUR EIGHT YEARS EACH THAT'S NOT AN EASY ASSIGNMENT. THAT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG LIKE THEY DID IN TEXAS. ARE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE TAT YOUR LEGISLATURE. I HAS BEEN FULLY APPRISED OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AND YOU HAVE THE BACKING. AND THE SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH INITIATIVES YOU FEEL. ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S COMING THEIR WAY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND ALSO THE COST. I UNDERSTAND THE CHARGING STATIONS WILL BE A COST OF THOSE WILL BE ADDED TO OUR UTILITY BILLS ON OUR STATE WHICH ARE. ALREADY VERY HIGH US SENATE YOUR BROUGHT UP. SO A LOT WORK. LAYS WITH YOU AND- I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOU NEED BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP THE CARROT OUT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU AND WOULD HOLD MY- SUPPORT TODAY. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU KNOW AND- IF ANY REPORTS OR OR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE CAN PROVIDE WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. AND THEN YOUR QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR MISTER MAJORITY LEADER YOU HAD ANOTHER COMMENTER QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW UP WITH JUST THAT ONE THING WAS INTERESTING TO FOLLOW UP ON CENTER BATES. YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH THIS CAR CHARGING ISSUE YOU CAN LITERALLY PUT ELECTRONS INTO THE GRID FROM YOUR HOME FROM YOUR FULL BATTERY IN YOUR CAR IN THE MID DAY. AND GET THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU GET PAID FOR CHART FOR PUT PAYING INTO THE GRID. AND THEN THE COMPUTER CAN TURN ON AT NIGHT WHEN THE COST IS LOW. AND THEN RECHARGE YOUR CAR SO YOU BASICALLY PROVIDING ELECTRONS AT THE PEAK POWER LIKE WE HAVE PETERS. AT AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE AN INCENTIVE TO ACTUALLY OWN AN ELECTRIC CAR IT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE FUTURE AS WE BEGIN TO INNOVATE MORE MORE. ASSEMBLY CREATIVE INCENTIVE MODELS THAT COULD ULTIMATELY WILL DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COST OF YOUR VEHICLE. YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO EAT IT IN THE INTEREST OF LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT NOW AS WE TRY TO MOVE TO GREEN TECHNOLOGY. IF I HAD AN AUTOMOBILE AND I NEED TO TRAVEL. TWO HUNDRED MILES AND MY CAR GOT. HIT TWENTY MILES TO THE GALLON I WOULD PUT TEN MILES OF TED TEN GALLONS OF FUEL IN THE TANK. AND I WOULD GO TO OUR MILES. NOW IS THE GOVERNMENT WE'RE TRYING TO GO TWO HUNDRED MILES. BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF THE WIND'S GOING TO BLOW WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S GOING TO BE CLOUD COVER. WE DON'T KNOW IF THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR TECHNOLOGY'S GOING TO DO A DIG THE- DO GREAT BECAUSE OF UP. THE HEAT. AND SO THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE IN THE BEGINNING IS WE HAVE TO REALLY KIND OF BUILD REDUNDANCY IN WHAT'S CALLED RESOURCE ADEQUACY. WHICH I DON'T WHICH I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH OF THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THESE UNFORESEEN EVENTS A CAR. RIGHT FROM PROPER PLANNING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC ITS STATE DOESN'T HAVE BLACKOUTS AND BROWNOUTS WE HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH REDUNDANCY IN THE SYSTEM. SO THAT WE HAVE THIS VOLATILITY THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T CAUSE THAT PROBLEM AND THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE PROBLEM FACING IN. ORDER FOR OF THE SENATE AGREE YOU MAY MEDICAL. ABOUT BATTERY OF THE WAS A TWENTY. MEGAWATTS WHATEVER YOU TALKED ABOUT. FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS WITH WHAT'S THE TIMING ON THAT ANGELINA WHAT WHEN YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF. WHAT WILL BE A FIFTEEN OVER TWENTY BUT BUT ONE ONE'S A HAPPENING WHAT'S OUR TIMING ON THAT. IT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THE GREAT EVERY DAY AND WE ARE ABLE TO MEET THAT RAMP MOSTLY WHAT IMPORTS AND SOME OF OUR GAS RESOURCES RAMPING UP- DURING THE EVENING PEAK. SO IT'S HAPPENING NOW BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO WORDS TO CARBON ISING IN DEEPER DECARBONIZATION AND REPLACING THOSE RESOURCES WITH CARBON FREE TECHNOLOGIES. DELAY BATTERIES AS WE SAID LONG TERM STORAGE OR GEOTHERMAL A WIN OUR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WE CAN RAMP UP AND DOWN AND OF COURSE. UTILIZING THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THE BATTERIES BEHIND THE METER AS WELL AS EFFICIENCY WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE MAD OR IT HAS TO BE REDUCED- FOR ALL OF US TO OPERATE THE GRID RELIABLY. AND WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT THAT HAPPENS. AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES JUST TO JUST TO POINT OUT THAT THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO IS VERY- BUT- WE HAVE CHARGING STATIONS IN OUR HOMES RIGHT NOW EVERY DAY. WHEN YOUR CAR INTO TO TWENTY OUTLET IN YOUR GARAGE RIGHT NOW. SO THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS MOSTLY FOR MEDIUM AND LARGE SCALE VEHICLES AND OF COURSE LONG DISTANCE IF PEOPLE WERE TRAVELING. AND IT'S THE FAST CHARGERS THAT ZAP THE SUSPECT THAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON. BUT THOSE AREN'T GOING TO BE AS MANY AS THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT WILL PROBABLY BE CHARGING IN THE HOMES AND GARAGES PEOPLE MOST OF THE TIME. WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT HAPPENS DURING THE NIGHT TIME AS YOU POINTED OUT SENATOR HERTZBERG. WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY PLAY ARBITRAGE WITH THE MARKET AND YOU'LL BE SUPPLYING ENERGY TO THE GRAND IF YOUR CAR IS PARKED IN YOUR GARAGE WHICH WORKPLACE YOU'RE NOT USING IT. DURING THAT PEAK IN THE RAMP AND THEN CHARGING IN THE EVENING OR DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN WE HAVE EXCESS ENERGY. THANK WE ARE HOPEFULLY NOT HAVING TO CURTAIL BECAUSE WE'RE CHARGING. YOUR CAR. THANKS YEAH I JUST AND HAVE TO CLICK TO ADD TO THAT ONE THING THAT THE REASON WHY I TO RESERVE GOING AND LIKE NOW IS INTEREST TO AUGUST OKAY SO IN THE CITY WORK TOGETHER REALIZE WE NEED TO FIFTY NINE TO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF RESOURCE IN THE GROUND NOW IN BATTERIES ARE THE FAST TECHNO TO BE TO WE CAN'T BUILD PLANT IN SIX MONTHS BUT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DEPLOY BATTERIES SO THE CPSC APPROVE NEW BATTERIES AND THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING INTERCONNECTED TO CRY SO GREAT AS WE SPEAK. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A POINT ON THE BATTERY SHOULD KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW I'M GETTING CONCERNED ABOUT THE NATURE THE BATTERIES IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT IS SANK MOST OF STUFF YOU'RE DOING IS LITHIUM ION READ THE STORIES IN THE SIMPLE THINGS FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH SO MANY COMPUTERS THAT WERE BLOWN UP BECAUSE THEY GOT TOO HOT THOSE HAD LITHIUM ION BATTERIES SO HE NOT ONLY HAS A DEGRADATION ISSUE ON THE SOLAR SIDE. THERE'S ALSO RISK IN TERMS OF THE BATTERY SIDE THE IN THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER TECHNOLOGIES FOR NOT USING BECAUSE LITHIUM IONS THE STUFF NOW BUT AGAIN LOOKING AT THE RISK PROFILE LOOKING AT RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND LOOKING AT THE NATURE OF THE TOOLS WERE USING IN THAT REGARD I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT BECAUSE I IT IS NOT RISK FREE AT ALL WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF HEAT. THE EXPLOSIONS ON THE BATTERIES A SCENE BECAUSE OF THAT SO I JUST AGAIN EITHER I DON'T WANT TO STRESS IT BUT I JUSTWANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE WE GET AS WE LOOK AT ALL THESE FACTORS WE HAVE VERY VERY MINDFUL VERY CONSERVATIVE ABOUT HOW. WE TRANSITION INTO THE GREEN SPACE. I'M ABSOLUTELY COULD. IF I MAY YOU. FOR OUT OVER FOCUS ON THE RIGHT. WHAT THE PRINTER. RISK BE WITH ALL. ACROSS THE BOARD. WITH A BAD. SPEED SO AND SOME OF THE DECORATIVE. OF THE SOLAR. TIME WHICH IS ABOUT 10% INCLUDING IN THE HEAT AND AFTER TEN YEARS. BUT ALSO WITH REGARDS TO GAS POWER PLANTS WHICH WE HAVE SEEN- ALSO OPERATE AND THEIR EFFICIENCY DECREASED IN REALLY HOT WEATHER. THE TUNE OF 20% AND HIGHER WHICH HAPPENED THIS SUMMER AS WELL. SUNDAY GRADATION. AND REDUNDANCIES IS ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE MISTER DOC WILL LOOK BACK AND WE NEED TO ENSURE WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCE. ENOUGH OF A VARIETY OF RESOURCES. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THAT HAPPENING ESPECIALLY. THAT THAT EVENING. THANK YOU AKAU. THE WELL LET ME JUST- COMMENT BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT I THINK- THIS BEEN A GREAT DISCUSSION I THINK THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. AGAIN I AGREE WITH SENATOR BATES IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GO. LAST OR NEAR LAST BECAUSE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE TOP OF THE MIND. I HAVE ALREADY BEEN COVERED. SO YOU KNOW FOR ME IT YOUR EXPERTISE IS CLEARLY VISIBLE TODAY- OBVIOUSLY- YOU KNOW THIS IS THE KIND OF EXPERTISE WE NEED I GET THAT THIS IS NOT YOUR DIRECT DAY JOBS ALTHOUGH. SOME OF WHAT YOU DO IS RELATED BUT- IS A PRETTY SERIOUS ISSUE IN A VERY SERIOUS JOB- FOR THIS TO BE KIND OF YOUR EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITY. SO I THINK- I THINK CALIFORNIA'S CLEARLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF OUR- EXPERTISE IN YOUR TALENT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT- THE OB I DON'T REALLY HAVE A QUESTION- BECAUSE- IN SOME RESPECTS I DON'T WANT TO. BEAT A DEAD HORSE HARM. OR ANYTHING- TO DEATH- BUT I DO WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW I AGREE THAT MARKETS ARE FINE AND GOOD THINGS FOR SOMETHINGS. ARE CLEARLY ARE MARKET FORCES ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY AND HOW THINGS WORK. BUT I ALSO THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE URGENT NEED FOR POWER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IT'S MORE OF A NECESSITY AS OPPOSED TO. ODD TO THE OTHER SO I WANT TO POINT THAT OUT AND THEN. BACK TO THE HORSE. I YOU KNOW GOVERNANCE IS IMPORTANT AND EVERY TIME A APPOINTEES COME BEFORE US FROM CAL AYE SO WE TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. AND THE FACT THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS GET HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG. AND YET WE DON'T ALWAYS YEAH YES. IS A LOOK AT OUR FORMER SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY- YEAH BACK BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETY NINE TWO THOUSAND- I THINK I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE ONLY DIRECT ABILITY WE HAVE. TO HAVE SOME INPUT IN THAT HAS THE LARGEST STATE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND SO- I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT AGAIN I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST RODEO TO STICK WITH THE HORSE METAPHOR. I IN TERMS OF BEING BEFORE DIFFERENT RULES COMMITTEES SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT AND APPRECIATE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACT THAT WE DO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. ARE SOME OF US DON'T EXACTLY HAVE YOUR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE OBVIOUSLY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES KNOW THIS ISSUE ENOUGH TO ASK INTELLIGENT QUESTIONS. BUT I APPRECIATE I YOU KNOW EVERY THING THAT YOU SAID TODAY THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US A FORWARD LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE STILL DEALING WITH AND THE FACT THAT YOU TAKE TIME TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH US I REALLY APPRECIATE. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS AND SAY THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND SO- I'M GONNA START. RIGHT HERE IN ROOM THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE AND- SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY I ACTUALLY DO NOT SEE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE. AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT MEANS THERE'S NO ONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE BUT I'M GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ROOM ON MY VIRTUAL SCREEN HERE. I SEE NO ONE APPROACH IN THE PODIUM IN OUR ROOM ONE TWELVE. SO I'M GOING TO TURN TO OUR TELECONFERENCE. AND ASK OUR MODERATOR WHO'S BEEN STANDING BY PATIENTLY TO INTRODUCE HIM OR HERSELF. AND DOES SAY WELCOME. MODERATOR ARE YOU THERE. I AM MADAM BROUGHT THEM THIS IS NICK WITH EIGHTEEN T. THANK YOU WELL WELCOME WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU JOIN US TODAY SO I WANT TO ASK IF YOU WILL SEE IF THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WAITING IN THE QUEUE THAT YOU QUEUE UP ACTUALLY- TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF OUR- APPOINTEES. BEFORE US TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF TODAY'S AMPLE- APPOINTEES. PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. IT WILL BE JUST A MOMENT PLEASE. OKAY AND AS WE'RE WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO OUR QUEUE UP HOPEFULLY PEOPLE ARE LISTENING OUT THERE I'M GOING TO ASK OUR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO GIVE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION IF ANY POSITION ON THE APPOINTMENT AND AGAIN ON BEHALF OF OUR STENOGRAPHER SPEAK SLOWLY AND CLEARLY. WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU OUR FIRST. PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF THIS FROM LINE TWELVE LINE TWELVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS I'M DANIEL OF FOR NOW ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN CLEAN POWER CALIFORNIA. THE AMERICAN CLEAN POWER ASSOCIATION WORKS TO CHAMPION POLICIES THAT WILL TRANSFORM THE U. S. POWER GRID TO A LOW COST RELIABLE AND RENEWABLE POWER SYSTEM. AB P. CALIFORNIA'S THE PROJECT OF THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION WITH A FOCUS ON DRIVING MEDIA THINGS DEVELOPMENT. OF NEW UTILITY SCALE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND STORAGE TO PROPEL CALIFORNIA TOWARD A CARBON FREE ELECTRIC FUTURE. WE WANT TO STRONGLY SUPPORT CONFIRMATION OF BOTH MESCAL HAVE THAT AS WELL AS THE COST OF BY WHAT- METALLIC HAVE UNDERSTANDS THE NEED FOR A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES M. TORRANCE. THAT MUST INCLUDE BOTH LAND BASED AND OFFSHORE WIND MORSEL LEARN MORE STORAGE DELIVERED OVER A STATE AND MODERN TRANSMISSION SYSTEM TO POWER CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY.

BAILING OUT. I WANT TO THANK. YOU SENATORS AND YOUR STAFF WILL BE GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME IN ADVANCE OF THIS HEARING. PROBABLY GOOD DISCUSSIONS AND NOT ADDRESS QUESTIONS. THAT I HAD WITH SOME OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL THEM WITH YOUR TEAMS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR OF COURSE WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE CONSIDERED. ARE YOU FOR THIS APPOINTMENT- SOME OF YOU KNOW EVOLUTION IS THE FOURTH GOVERNOR. AND I WORKED FOR. OVER THE YEARS REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS. I'M STARTING IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES. AND- I HAVE TO SAY PREPARING FOR THIS HAS BEEN INTERESTING FOR ME BECAUSE I DISCOVERED THAT I STILL HAVE THAT SENSE OF AWE THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS A FELLOW IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND EXACTLY FOR JERRY BROWN'S. IN WHICH ALL OF ONE POINT. I NEVER LOST OUT WALKING INTO THE- CAPITOL BUILDING. AND THAT BEING MY PLACE OF WORK. AND ABOUT HOW MANY YEARS I WAS AT IT AND I STILL FEEL THAT YOU CONSUMING AND- RIGHT NOW. I'M AND THE OTHER THING I HAVE I HOPE. YOU ALL KNOW I CARRY WITH ME. HI GOING ALL THE WAY BACK THEN. THIS IS FROM MY FAMILY. AND THAT IS A DEDICATION TO SPEAKING UP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE. AND FOR THE VALUE OF THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE ALONGSIDE THE EXPERTISE. OF THE EXPERTS AND INVEST. HI MY RELATIVELY NEW TO THIS. COUNCIL BUT THERE'S A LOT OF. SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE AND IT'S AWESOME I'M LEARNING SO MUCH AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT IN THIS. THESE TIMES IN SITUATION RENT- BUT SO IS THE LIVED EXPERIENCE THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED BY IT AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING I. I WANT TO KNOW IS KIND OF IN MY DNA- ON SURE QUICKLY A FAMILY STORY THAT I THINK. ILLUSTRATES WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IT IS ALSO RELEVANT TO THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. MY MATERNAL. GRANDFATHER MY MOM'S DAD. HOW'S THE SMALL. YOU POOR FARMER. ON THE DELTA STARTING IN EIELSON AND ENDING. UP IN WHAT IS NOW NORTHERN. NORTH SACRAMENTO. HE GREW WALNUTS BLACK WALNUTS INSOLVENCIES CANDY- BACK THEN DURING THE DEPRESSION AND SOME YEARS AFTER. AND THERE WAS A STORY HE TOLD- THAT WAS ABOUT WHEN THERE WERE THE HEAVY RAINS AND THE RISK OF FLIGHT. TO THEIR FARMLAND AND HE STORY GOES AND HIS NEIGHBORS. AND MY UNCLES AND MY GRANDPA SENSE WOULD PATROL THE LEVY BACK AND FORTH IN THE RAIN. WITH SHOT GUNS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED- WITH SOME REASON THAT IF THEY WEREN'T THERE TO PROTECT THE LEVY THAT THE MORE WELL HEELED INTERESTS WOULD ARRANGE FOR SOMEONE TO COME DOWN FROM THOSE AREAS AND INTENTIONALLY FLOOD BEFORE FARMS TO AVOID THAT HAPPENING TO THE MORE AFFLUENT AREAS OF SACRAMENTO. AND THAT STORY IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT STUCK WITH ME ABOUT EQUITY. AND DEFENDING THOSE WHO ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN BIG DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT. THE THREAT OF FLOODS IS STILL TOP OF MIND FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES I'VE BEEN MAKING A POINT OF LISTENING ALL I CAN'T. TWO OF THOSE WHO COULD BE MOST IMPACTED BY SOME OF THE DECISIONS. YOU MAKE AND WE MAKE THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. AND WHAT COMES UP MORE THAN ANYTHING FROM MARVEL COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY RISK OF FLOODS. ABOUT A FIFTH OF DELTA RESIDENTS ARE IN IMMINENT DANGER OF FLOOD. A CONSEQUENCE THE FUNDING OVER THE NEXT. SEVERAL YEARS SO I WAS I WAS LISTENING. TO YOU I MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG TALKING ABOUT ENERGY THE PREVIOUS HEARING WHICH IS FASCINATING TO ME- BUT EVERYTHING YOU SAID ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALSO RELEVANT TO WATER AS YOU KNOW YOU WILL NOW- AND SPEAKING AGAIN ABOUT-THOSE WHO. STAND TO BE MOST IMPACTED BY THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE FLEET. WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS LIKE A FLOOD OR FIRE PEOPLE WHO WORK OUTSIDE. WHEN THE HEAT IS EXTREME. SO I WELL I. APPROACH THIS. IS SO FAR I WILL GOING FORWARD IN A BALANCED WAY. WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES AROUND CONVEYANCING- AND OTHER THINGS A COUPLE TALK ABOUT NOW. THERE IS ONE THING I AM JEALOUS ABOUT AND THAT IS HOW THESE ISSUES AFFECT PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE HOW THE LEAST. VOICE SOMETIMES REALLY APPRECIATED. YOUR TIME. SURE I CAN TALK ABOUT IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNANCE AND PARTICIPATION IN COURT. YOU KNOW THIS HEARINGS A PART OF THAT THAT'S TERRIFIC. YES I COUNCIL THAT I SET OUT TO ASK QUESTIONS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT I DON'T KNOW ASKING QUESTIONS IN PUBLIC FORUMS THAT THE ORDINARY PEOPLE MIGHT ALSO ASK AND SUPPORTING THEM WHEN THEY DO WHEN THEY SHOW UP AND TRYING TO MAKE SCIENCE MORE ACCESSIBLE. IN A WAY THAT. WE CAN REALLY HEAR FROM IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. PEOPLE ARE THE MOST TO LOSE. MOST AT RISK. IS SOMEBODY'S BIG ISSUES THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH GROUND WATER CLIMATE CHANGE CENTER. SO I'M GONNA WRAP UP THEIR DISBURSING AGAIN I'VE HAD A LONG. HISTORY AND STATE SERVICE. I'M MY BROTHER WHEN I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS CHAPTER SAID WELL MAYBE THIS IS HER ONE LAST CHANCE TO GET IT RIGHT AND SO IN THAT SPIRIT OF HUMILITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND WILLINGNESS TO MAYBE GIVE ME ONE LAST CHANCE TO GET IT RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ESTERS AND GOLLY LET ME START IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION TODAY SENATOR GROW YOU WANT TO KICK US OFF. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU MR THEN GOLLY FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS IF WE COULD ANSWER AND I'LL TRY TO GO QUICKLY. AND WHAT KEY CRITERIA DO YOU BELIEVE THE DSE SHOULD BE OR SHOULD USE IN EVALUATING WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED DELTA CONVEYANCE PROJECT IS CONSISTENT. WITH THE DELTA PLAN- THE REASON WHY I ASK THIS IS THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS WHETHER THE DELTA CONVEYANCE PROJECT PUT IT TO ACHIEVE. THE REGULATORY APPROVALS NECESSARY TO PROCEED. AND WHETHER STAT WATER PROJECT EAT WATER USERS WOULD ULTIMATELY AGREED TO PAY FOR THE PROJECT IF IT IS APPROVED. AND IN YOUR VIEW WHAT STEPS WOULD- SHOULD WE STATE WE SHOULD WE TAKE TO CONSIDER MAKING TO APPROVE THE WATER SUPPLY. REBUT LIABILITY IF THE PROJECT DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD. I THANK YOU CENTER GROVE THE QUESTION. AB SO THE COUNCIL WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TIME NOT FOR LOOKING AT THE CONVEYANCE PROPOSAL HAS IT COVERED ACTION IN OF ITSELF BUT WITHIN THAT PROPOSAL I'M WE WILL BE LOOKING AT- THERE FOURTEEN REGULATIONS I BELIEVE THAT- WILL BE PART OF OUR REVIEW. THE ONES THAT REALLY STOOD OUT FOR ME IN PREPARING FOR THAT WITH THAT COMES AS I'M DOING NOW- ONE AGAIN AT TRIGGERING THE FOR ME WERE TO IS AN ISSUE OF REAL PORN STAR HOPE ALLOWED DOLLY AT THE COUNCIL THAT'S LOCAL INPUT IT THAT'S REQUIREMENTS. AND ONE THEY YEAH THE COUNCIL HAS THE AUTHORITY TO INSIST ON SO I'LL BE KEEPING A VERY CLOSE EYE ON THE OUTSIDE STERN AUTHENTIC WAY COLLUSIVE WAY GET A PEOPLE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHOSE VOICES SOMETIMES LET OUT A SHOUT- BUT DEFINITELY THAT THE- IT'S INFORMED BY SCIENCE. THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND- MY THING I'M LEARNING IS THAT THERE'S KIND OF SNAPSHOT SCIENCE WITH THERE'S FOUR K. SIGN WHICH IS. SITUATION LIKE THAT SO THEY COULD BE IMPORTANT FOR ELEMENTS THAT PROJECT TO BE. EVALUATED BASED ON FORECAST SCIENCE- ANOTHER ONE JUST THAT I SEE AS IMPORTANT ALMOST TO YOU NOW WE CAN WRITE THIS TO YOU BUT- IT THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM ANY CONVEYANCE. PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE YOUR REDUCE RELIANCE ON DETAILS. BECAUSE FOR US TO MAKE THIS ALL WORK COMMITTEE. PIECE OF THE PUZZLE ON THERE ARE FOLKS THERE IN THAT ROOM NOW KNOW THIS BETTER THAN I DO BUT- THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL PART. TIME THE COUNCIL SUPPORTS CONVEYANCE BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO REDUCE RELIANCE. ON THE DELTA MORE THAN HALF. OF CALIFORNIANS TODAY. DEPEND ON DELTA WATER FOR SOME OF THE SOME OF THEIR DRINKING WATER- AND THAT'S THAT'S A HEAVY LOAD. SO SO THAT THOSE ARE THE CRITERIA THAT REALLY JUMPED OUT AT ME IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION SENATOR. BUT THAT THERE ARE FORTUNATE WE WOULD YOU KNOW TAKE UNDER CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE DID BRING IT JINKING WATER AND THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT I HAD AS WELL. YOU KNOW REPRESENTING THE BACK OF THE VALLEY THE CENTRAL VALLEY I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT- HOW DID YOU MEET THE NEEDS OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NOT SPECIFICALLY IN THE VALLEY BUT FROM THE VALLEY AND BEYOND. AND BALANCE THAT DRINKING WATER. FROM THE DELTA IN THE INTEREST IN THE DELTA SO. ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE VALLEY AND BEYOND I'M RECEIVE DRINKING WATER FROM THE DELTA AND I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT HOW. YOU'RE GOING TO BALANCE THOSE NEEDS WITH THE NEEDS- THAT THE. IN THE DELTA COMMUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE. YES SO I YOU TO- LANDED ON WHAT IS ONE OF THE BOYS IMPORTANT RESPONSE. OF THE COUNCIL ON IS RELIABLE RELIABLE SOURCE OF WATER. AGAIN I HAVE A HISTORY OF. SOME INVOLVEMENT WITH THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER FOR ME IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT IT'S LIFE ITSELF AS YOU KNOW- I WAS AMONG THOSE WHO WAS STUNNED AND ASHAMED. WHEN WE DISCOVERED A SHORT TIME AGO THAT THEY WERE PERHAPS MILLION CALIFORNIANS. WHO DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE HEALTHY DRINKING WATER AFTER BATHING DRINKING FOR COOKING AS YOU KNOW AB I DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE. OF THOSE OF YOU IN THE ROOM LEADERS IN THE ROOM RIGHT THERE ARE FOR SHARING SHOCK AND- DOING A LOT TO RECTIFY THAT I THINK WE'RE ON TRACK TO POTENTIALLY BEHIND US. BUT THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE TWO PILLARS OF WHAT WE SEE AS OUR OUR RESPONSIBILITY ON THE COUNCIL IS RELIABLE WATER THE OTHER IS TO PROTECT AND RESTORE THE DELTA AND WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IS NOT. SEE THOSE IN IN CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER NECESSARILY BECAUSE THE FACT IS I'M LEARNING MORE EVERYDAY FROM SCIENTISTS BUT- A HEALTHY ECOSYSTEM. IS BETTER FOR RELIABLE WATER. AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY AT ODDS BUT TO GO TO GET TO THAT PLACE. I HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE TWO THINGS DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE IN CONTENTION MEANS WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER BETTER BLAND'S SCIENCE I BE WILLING TO COLLABORATE AND COMPROMISED SO IT'S HOLDING THOSE TWO THINGS IN BALANCE. AT THE SAME TIME BUT I THINK THE PRIMARY FOCUS YOU GET ON IT. THE COUNCIL AND IN DOING SO RECOGNIZING THAT THE DELTA IS ALSO A PLACE. AS MY FAMILY HISTORY TELLS ME- AT TIMES. THE PEOPLE LIVE THEY- AND IT WOULD YOU HAVE TO BE VERY. OF THE PEOPLE THERE AND THERE LOOK THERE'S THEIR WITH. ARE IMPORTANT AS WELL. THANK YOU SIR I APPRECIATE YOUR HEART COMMITMENT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE WITHOUT WATER AND THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WITHOUT WATER IN THE FUTURE. THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS IT DO YOU SEE A NEED TO BETTER RECONCILE THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. DELTA REFORM ACT- WITH HOW IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED TODAY. I'M NOT SURE THAT I WOULD THANK. RECOMMEND THAT AT THIS MOMENT I WILL SAY- CAN YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME NOT IN THIS DEEPER LEVEL OF WHAT YOU WANT ISSUE AREA BUT- I WAS AROUND ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT- THERE WAS A TIME. WHEN WE WERE MUCH LESS. WELL COORDINATED THAT WE ARE NOW I REMEMBER WHEN. EVEN WHEN I WAS IN HIGH RANKING POSITIONS AND ADMINISTRATIONS IT WAS HARD TO JUST GET SIMPLE INFORMATION. BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY. A DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND JURISDICTIONS. NOT REALLY TALKING TO EACH OTHER VERY WELL- RIGHT IN AND A GREAT DEAL IN MY OPINION LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GET ANSWERS WHEN I COULD NOT I WAS A HIGH RANKING POSITION MATCH IF YOU'RE JUST A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC RESIDENT SOMETHING AT STAKE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER CONSISTENT ANSWERS IT'S CLEARLY A BETTER SITUATION NOW IN TERMS OF COORDINATION- TRANSPARENCY THAT DASHBOARD. THAT ARE AGENCIES INVOLVED WITH HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE I THINK IT'S JUST GETTING BASIC INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S BROKEN WATER USE OR HABITAT INFORMATION FLOOD INFORMATION SERVICE RECORD RECREATION PRISON YOU GET ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION ON DASHBOARD AND THAT'S NEW SO I THINK IT'S GETTING BETTER I'M NOT GOING TO. TELL YOU ALL WHAT TO DO TERMS OF- YEAH. GOING FURTHER AT THIS MOMENT BUT- PROPERTY I'LL BE ABLE TO THINK SMART. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ASKS US QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR. I THANK YOU I'M GOING TO TURN TO OUR FORMER SECRETARY AND SENATOR LAYER TO SEE INTERESTING QUESTIONS COMMENTS HE MIGHT PUT BEFORE YOU MISTERS AGO ALI. YEAH JUST IN CASE I DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR I STILL HAVE BEEN A LOT LIKE WHEN I WAS A YOUNG FELLOW BUT I'M ALSO TERRIFIED LIKE WHEN I WAS A YOUNG FELLOW WHO. ON THEIR- HE'S STILL JUST HE'S A SWEETHEART AT YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD SENATOR. I'LL DO THAT IN PUBLIC NO THAT'S OKAY I COULD SEE A MOVE HIS HAND TO HIS WALLET SO I KNEW WHAT WAS. HAPPENING THERE- AND I KNOW HIM WELL I THINK HE'LL BE A OF A GREAT. OF SERVANT HERE AN ODD YOU KNOW AND I HAVE MY OWN CHECKERED PAST I WORKED RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE FOR CONGRESSMAN WALTER WHO HATED DELTA CONVEYANCE AND WAS DEDICATED AGAINST US AND THEN WORKED FOR JERRY BROWN FOR EIGHT YEARS WHO'S DEDICATED TO BUILDING IT AND SO. YOU KNOW I WORK FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE FIRMLY BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE THEN I THINK THE DANIEL THE ONE THING I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IT IT'S A LITTLE. I TAKE OFF ON SENATOR. QUESTION A AND IT'S BASICALLY THAT. THAT THE DELTA REFORM ACT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. ARE YOU TALKED ABOUT GOVERNMENT SHOULD SET UP ALL THIS GOVERNMENTS. SO YOU HAVE THE DELTA CONSERVANCY% THAT'S DOING HABITAT RESTORATION YOU HAVE- THE- DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION THEN YOU HAVE THE- THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL THIS IS JUST COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM EVERY STATE AND LOCAL AGENCY OR FEDERAL AGENCY THAT DOES IT TOO. SO THERE'S JUSTICE ANALYST JURISDICTION THAT EVERYBODY HAS ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE- THE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL WAS CREATED PRIMARILY TO REVIEW AGAINST SCIENCE A CONVEYANCE- PROJECT THE TWELVE YEARS LATER HAS NEVER COME FORWARD TO THE- ODD TO THE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. AND SO THE QUESTION IS. WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL DO YOU THINK THIS IS A AN AGENCY THAT IS NOW CREATED A MISSION DO YOU THINK ONCE IT REVIEWS A CONVEYANCE PROJECT IN DEALS WITH THAT THAT IT IS LIVED OUT ITS MISSION. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FUTURE OF THE AGENCIES. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- SOONER THAN LIKE TO GIVE MORE THOUGHT TO I MEAN I WILL SAY. FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT AND THIS IS NEW FOR ME AS YOU KNOW I. GENERALLY IS IT PASSED FROM CITY. LANDSCAPE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS AND HOW THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER NOW I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM. FROM ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. I WILL SAY THAT- PERSONALLY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JESSICA PERSON IS OUTSTANDING. SHE SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND. IT BETTER COR. SAID GOOD GOVERNMENT IS NOT ABOUT EXERTING YOUR AUTHORITY OR POWER IS MORE ABOUT INFLUNCE. AND THE DELTA COUNCIL DOESN'T HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY OVER A LOT OF THINGS. AND THAT CEO OF JURISDICTION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS YOU KNOW. BUT SHE AND HER TEAM SEEM TO DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS. SETTING TABLES ARE SHARING INFORMATION. AND NOT NOT JUST IN ONE DIRECTION WHERE YOU GET INFORMATION FROM ONE SURE WITH ANOTHER- THEY REALLY SEEM TO HAVE MASTERED. THANK YOU IT TOOK ME YEARS TO GAIN UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOVERNMENT. OF THE INFLUENCE CAN BE BETTER THAN THAT FORTY SO I THINK THAT IS DEFINITELY AN ADDED VALUE- BUT I'M COGNIZANT OF YOUR POINT THAT- CONVEYANCE. IT'S KIND OF A CENTERPIECE OF A LOT OF YEARS YOU'RE SPEAKING AND UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND- I GUESS TIME WILL TELL. WHETHER AND BEYOND THAT- NOT PLENTY TIME COME. WE'LL STILL NEED TO. THE TALK TO STORAGE ACCOUNT BUT I WILL MY PRESS IS THAT THIS PARTICULAR TEAM OF PEOPLE ARE ADDING VALUE. TO A VERY COMPLEX DIFFICULT. LANDSCAPE ONE OF THEM LET ME ASK A QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK BUT IT BUT IT COMES FROM THAT I KNOW GOVERNOR BROWN WAS COMPLETELY EXASPERATED WITH THIS AGENCY A BECAUSE HE NEVER FELT LIKE THEY IN DO HAVE THIS IN FRONT OF YOU. ISSUES ARE NOT NEW. IT COMING IN FRONT OF YOU WILL NOT BE NEW. WILL YOU BE ABLE TO ACT EXPEDITIOUSLY OPERA ON A PROJECT IF IT COMES IN FRONT OF YOU IN A WAY THAT. THAT YOU CAN APPLY THE SCIENCE AT ALL THE ROUND TABLES YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT TO JUST ARE ACTING ON THIS IN THE NEXT. BUT DISHES WHY EITHER WHY YOU ACT ON IT. I HOPE SO. SENATOR I- YEAH I WILL NEVER BE THE MOST HAVE. EXPERTS WERE KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON AT THIS TABLE. OF EXPERTS SCIENTISTS OTHERS. AND TERMS OF THE PROTECT TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF IT. BUT I DID LEARN OVER THE YEARS TO BE DECISIVE I LEARNED THE VALUE. OF MAKING A DECISION THAT THERE'S NEVER A PERFECT DECISION. BUT THE WORST DECISION YOU CAN MAKE IS TO JUST KEEP PUTTING SOMETHING OFF- AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S- ENDEMIC IN GOVERNMENT BUT- I CAN JUST GIVE MY PERSONAL PLEDGE THAT I WILL BE PUSHING FOR DECISIVE ACTION. AND DIED AND YOU KNOW. TIME TELL WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND AS- SOMEBODY THAT FLUNKING RETIREMENT I JUST SAY WELCOME TO THE CLUB. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED I'M GONNA GO TO SENATOR BATES NOW GO AHEAD SENATOR. THANK YOU AND JOE- CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR STEPPING INTO THEIR PHONE WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION EARLIER IN THE DAY VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT YOU ARE IDENTIFIED TO TRY TO VERTICAL LEARNING CURVE ON THE F. BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE OF WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF US WE JUMP INTO SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN. AROUND FOR QUITE AWHILE AND YOU'VE HEARD THE DISCUSSION EARLIER ON ENERGY FILL- CERTAINLY THE DELTA CONVEYANCE PROJECT HAS BEEN THERE FOR QUITE AWHILE AND I THINK OF THE ON THE COUNCIL HERE. MISTER COUNSELORS BASICALLY. REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A DELTA PLAN SO I JUST HAVE A ONE QUESTION FOR YOU WHETHER. THE CONVEYANCE PROJECT ACTUALLY MAKES IT IF IT FAILS TO GET ALL AND OUT NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS. IS THERE A PLAN B. OUT THERE THAT YOU OF YOU KNOW BEEN BRIEFED ON. IS EVEN SOMETHING DISCUSS THE THAT WOULD BE IN PLACE TO ENSURE AND IMPROVE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FINANCIALLY WITH YOU KNOW THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ATTHE SAME TIME PROTECTING THE APPLE SYSTEM THAT. WATER RELIABILITY AS YOU'VE MENTIONED ESPECIALLY FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IS REALLY. SUCH A HIGH PRIORITY AND I KNOW THAT IS FOR YOU SO. OFTEN FAR FROM THAT. THANK YOU ADVICE SERVICE AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING SO GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME IN OUR OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION. I'M SORRY AGAIN THE COUNCIL SUPPORTS CONVEYANCE- WE BELIEVE THAT NEEDS TO BE A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THE JUROR. THIS IS PART OF YOUR QUESTION- YOUR HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION OF WHAT IF THAT PIECE OF PUZZLE MISSING I GUESS WE WOULD. HAVE TO RELY EVEN MORE ON THE OTHER PIECES WHICH IS WE'RE GONNA NEED WITH OR WITHOUT COMPLAINTS. BUT PREFERABLY WITH- AND THAT IS I THINK YOU ALL KNOW IS WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF CONSERVATION I KNOW PEOPLE GET TIRED OF HEARING IT BUT WE ACTUALLY CAN'T BETTER AND MUST. A CONSERVATION STORAGE HAS TO BE PART OF THAT THAT PUZZLE WHEN I SPOKE ABOUT THAT EARLIER YEAH SENATOR BATES INDEED IT DOES IT'S SORT OF THE- IT'S TAKEN A LOT OF. MONEY IN THE BANK- AS AS SITUATION MORE VOLATILE. HI THIS YEAR SALLY IS ANOTHER CASE IN POINT. OF HOW UNRELIABLE PRECIPITATION IS IN THE STATE. MAYBE LOOKING AT SOMETHING AS BAD AS- WILL REMEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. YOU HAVE TO HAVE. WATER STORAGE SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF- AND YOU KNOW AGAIN IT HABITAT RESTORATION THAT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PIECE OF THIS IS IMPORTANT TOO BECAUSE WITH OR WITHOUT TO DANCE- WE HAVE TO GET OUR ECOSYSTEMS IN BETTER SHAPE RESTORATION AND PROTECTION. IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A ALLOW WATER SUPPLY BUT HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE ALONGSIDE SOME VERSION OF CONVENIENCE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE IN MY HEAD BUT THAT SHOULD OR WILL LOOK LIKE AGAIN I THINK THAT HELD THE TITLE BE THE DETAILS BUT- BUT- BUT I HOPE. IT'S IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO SEE ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH. THANK YOU AND AGAIN I'M VERY IMPRESSED AND I'M- VERY HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR APPOINTMENT TO THIS POSITION ESPECIALLY ON OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION AND WHAT YOU SHARED. IN TERMS OF YOUR PRIORITIES AND I THINK THAT. YOU'RE THE PERFECT PERSON. TO BE THERE IN TERMS OF. DEALING WITH THIS STORAGE IS YOU AND- SENATOR HERTZBERG YOU MIGHT REMEMBER BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY DAYS. WE HAD A BIG- BLOCKADE ON VOTING FOR THE BUDGET IF YOU REMEMBER THAT. IT WAS A TWO THIRDS VOTE IN THOSE DAYS. AND THE REPUBLICANS WERE VERY RECALCITRANT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO GO THERE AND THEY ON. OUR LEADERS AND I THINK BOB MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PART OF THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE. I'VE GOT GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS TO AGREE TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR STORAGE AND NOW WITH A BIG. HEART ISSUE. AND THAT THAT BOTTLES VOTE SO IT GOES WAY BACK TO THAT WAS IN 200-012-0002 SOME. SOMETHING IN THAT SAME. DAY SO IT CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE AND I KNOW THAT. THAT IS DEFINITELY OFF ON YOUR PLAN SO. YOU HAVE MY- FIVE FIVE AND MY ENDORSEMENT TO WHEN WE GET TO THE BILL AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. I REALLY. ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BATES I'M HONORED TO HAVE SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR- MISTER MAJORITY LEADER. THANK YOU AGAIN JUST FOR THE RECORD I. JUST GOT A POTENTIAL ISSUES THAT I WANT TO DISCLOSE. FIRST OF ALL- V. APPOINTEES PARTNER WAS A NEIGHBOR OF MINE MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AGO JACKIE SUPPLE HE WAS KNOWN AS IN THOSE DAYS AND- HIS FATHER WAS MY DOCTOR. AND HIS SISTER ASKED ME TO THE CITY HAWKINS DANCE. SO I WILL TELL YOU THANK GOODNESS YOU'VE DISCLOSED THIS. MADAM CHAIR THAT I'M SURE COULD I HAVE A POINT OF PERSON. I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT THE FATHER THAT WAS YOUR DOCTOR. WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH MY FATHER IT ELEANOR AND I PRODUCED A YEAR BOOK OF HIS FATHER WRITING A NOTE TO MY FATHER SO I'VE GOT TO BY TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS ALL. ALL I CAN SAY IS SENATOR BATES TOP THAT. I ALSO WANT TO DISCLOSE THAT MY FORMER SPOUSE HIRED YOU AWAY FROM MARIA SHRIVER SUPPOSEDLY FOR YOUR CALIFORNIA DIAMOND EVER SOLD WITH THAT ON THE RECORD WE'LL GET TO THE SUBSTANCE. OF IT AND AGAIN TALKING ABOUT FORMERS I WANTED TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO YOUR FORMER BOSS. GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER UP BECAUSE AS YOU WELL KNOW FROM THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM. AT THE ISSUE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN YOUR OPENING WITH RESPECT TO LEVEES WAS QUITE IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW SOME MILLIONS MEASURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. THE DELTA REFORM ACT. ARE CALLED ON THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL TO LEAD A MULTI AGENCY EFFORT TO UPDATE PRIORITIES FOR STATE INVESTMENTS IN THE DELTA LEVEE SYSTEM. THE MAJORITY LEADER OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THAT ISSUE WHICH YOU REFERRED TO AND CERTAINLY OUR DATA SHOWS THAT RECENT COST ESTIMATES WE DID ISSUE A ONE POINT THREE TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO DEAL WITH THOSE. ISSUES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. JUST WANTED TO GET ANY THOUGHTS YOU HAD IN THAT REGARD GIVEN SO IT DID YOU CORRECT CORRECTLY. NOTED HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. THANK YOU FOR A EMPHASIZING THAT. MAJORITY HERTZBERG AND. AND I THINK YOU KNOW YOU CHARACTERISTICALLY NAILED IT THE CORE ISSUE THIS IS A RESOURCE QUESTION I MEAN AND RESOURCES I MEAN MONEY. IF WE'RE IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT. PROTECTING YEAH I MENTIONED THAT IF THE PEOPLE IN THE DELTA REGION ARE AT RISK OF CONSEQUENCES SERIOUS FLOODING IN YEARS AHEAD- THERE IT'S GOING TO TAKE INVESTMENT RESOURCES AND THAT'S BEYOND THE PURVIEW OF THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AS YOU KNOW. BUT I HAVEN'T AND I'VE BEEN ASKING EVERYONE I'M HAVE THE LUXURY NOW BEING EXPOSED TO THE EXPERTS ON ALL SIDES OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. I HAVEN'T GOT AN ANSWER YET THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE SOME MAJOR EXPENDITURES SO I WOULD SECOND SALE WISE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT COMPLICATES THINGS FOR EVERYONE BUT WHAT I'M JUST YEAH. MYSTERIES IS BECAUSE OF YOUR EXPERTISE AND YOUR EXPERIENCE IN RELATIONSHIP CONSERVING FOR GOVERNORS I WOULD JUST TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ALLOWED VOICE YOU KNOW SO OFTEN IN GOVERNMENT TEXAS IS CERTAINLY LEARNED THAT JUST RECENTLY. WE HAVE SOME CATASTROPHE REPORTS WRITTEN WE TALK ABOUT IT AND THEN NOTHING HAPPENS BECAUSE JUST EVERY WEEK THERE'S A NEW PROBLEM THAT DEMANDS OUR ATTENTION. AND THE GOOD GOVERNANCE GOOD GOVERNMENT EXCUSE ME R. REQUIRES THAT WE STAY VIGILANT AND THAT WE PLAN FOR THESE THINGS IN ADVANCE OF THE DON'T BECOME CATASTROPHES AND CERTAINLY. YOU LOOK AT ALL THE RISK THAT YOU'RE KEENLY AWARE OF I WOULD JUST CONTINUE TO BE A LOUD VOICE AND I JUST TELL YOU YOU HAVE A- STRONG SUPPORTER AND SOMEONE WHO. ALTHOUGH I REPRESENT THAT PORTION OF THE STATE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE RESOURCES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY JUST READ A STORY TODAY ABOUT THE DROUGHT THE NUMBERS SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE PERCENTAGES OF DELIVERY THAT. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND IT'S QUITE CHALLENGING AND WE'VE GOT TO BALANCE THAT OUT SO. I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU TO STAY STRONG ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE IT AND USE YOUR LEVERAGE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS- TO HELP IN THAT REGARD THAT'S ONLY THING I WILL TAKE THAT TO HEART. THANK YOU MAJORITY LEADER THANK YOU US SENATOR I WOULD JUST. ADD TO THIS THIS IS BEEN- NOT ONLY AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION BUT- CERTAINLY A FUN ONE- YOU KNOW REPRESENTING SO DIEGO WHICH IS ALL THE WAY IF YOU OTHER- IN. OF THE STATE. BOB PEOPLE HAVE A- ABOUT. THE CO EQUAL GOALS AND CONVEYANCE- AS YOU'RE QUITE AWARE AND- YOU KNOW I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO AND I KNOW THAT SENATOR BATES UP IN ORANGE COUNTY IS AWARE. OF THE APPROACH WE'VE TAKEN AND SAN DIEGO CONSERVATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB STORAGE IS A PIECE OF OUR- PORTFOLIO. OF PURE WATER WATER RE USE AND DIESEL ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE PART OF OUR- DIVERSIFICATION TO TRY TO HELP THE MASTER.

REBELDE INSURERS AND TRYING TO REHABILITATE THEM AND ALSO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS. WHO HAVE CLAIMS WILL WITH WITH THOSE PARTIES I STARTED WORKING WITH THE CONSERVATION LIQUIDATION OFFICE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND SINCE THAT TIME OUR OFFICE HAS DISTRIBUTED FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND INSOLVENT INSURANCE COMPANY ASSETS.

OKAY IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE AND THANK YOU FOR DOING THE WORK IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT JOB AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE IN THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE- GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD WATCH. THE BOARD SPORTS. THANK YOU- SENATOR GROWTH. I GUESS I SHOULD JUST ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS SINCE I'M ON A ROLL TODAY AND THERE'S ABOUT FIFTEEN STATES THAT CLO. AT CURRENTLY MANAGES THIRTEEN HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR LONGER THAN FIFTEEN YEARS AND SO MY QUESTION I GUESS IS HE'LL HAVE AN ESTIMATED TIME. WHEN THOSE THE STATE'S CAN BE CLOSED AND HOW WILL THE STATE CLOSURES IMPACT- YOUR WOR FORCE NEEDS. RIGHT OF THE FIFTEEN STATES FIVE THOSE ARE A PART OF ONE GROUP WHICH IS THE SUPERIOR NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY. WE ARE CLOSING THAT PARTICULAR ESTATE THIS YEAR AND WILL DISTRIBUTE THE EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS- SO THAT NOW TO BRING OUR PORTFOLIO DOWN TO TEN COMPANIES AT THAT POINT. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTIONS LINED UP FOR THIS YEAR OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL- IT WILL REDUCE OUR PORTFOLIO. OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR ASSETS THAT THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY MANAGING BELONG TO ALL A COMBINATION OF TEN INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE ORDER NOW CALLED CASTLE NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY. THAT IS A RELATIVELY- INSOLVENCY NOT SAY NEW THAT WAS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- WITH THIS PARTICULAR STATE HAS A LOT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS LIABILITY CLAIMS. THAT HAVE TO BE ADMINISTERED- AND OUR BIGGEST ASSET IS THE REINSURANCE THAT. WE COLLECT AFTER THESE CLAIMS ARE PAID. AND SO- THAT'LL BE THE FOCUS OF OUR GREAT FOR THE NEXT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS. BEFORE ABLE TO CLOSE OUT THAT PARTICULAR STATE. THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH FOR THAT I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU ARE CENTER LAYERED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. ARM I REALLY ENJOYED OUR MEETING AND- THE A I THINK YOU SATISFACTORILY ANSWERED ANYTHING BUT I THOUGHT THERE WAS ONE SUBJECT I WOULD LIKE TO PUT. ON THE RECORD IN AN EXCHANGE AND IT. IS OBVIOUSLY HAVING A FIRE BURNED A COUPLE OF MARKET WITHIN A COUPLE MILES MY HOUSE THAT TOOK NINE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HOMES. IS THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH GETTING FIRE INSURANCE. AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS AT RESOURCES THERE WAS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. THAT WENT BELLY UP. OUR WITH PARADISE OF POLICIES WITHIN WEEKS OF THE PARADISE FIRE. AND I ASKED YOU IF YOU THOUGHT THAT WITH THE ADDITION OFFIRE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S SUCH A GREAT RATE. THAT WOULDN'T WE HAVE BIGGER. A COMPANIES START TO GO WONDER BECAUSE OF FIRE AND YOU BASICALLY SAID NO BECAUSE OF THE REINSURANCE- IT COULD YOU JUST TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT DYNAMIC IS. SURE AND- AND MERCED WAS WAS DEFINITELY A TRAGEDY- OF UNPRECEDENTED FIRE- AND ONE THAT. AFTER FURTHER REVIEW- THE THERE WERE SOME LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT CONCENTRATION. A NUMBER OF CLAIMS IN A CERTAIN LOCATION- THE LARGER INSURANCE COMPANIES WORK WITH THEIR REINSURERS NOW TO MAP BASICALLY BY ZIP CODE- WHERE EXACTLY THE RISK THAT THEY HAVE ARE- AND THEY THEY PROBABLY PUT THEIR PRICING TOGETHER BASED ON THAT YES. AND SO THE LARGER COMPANIES- BY- ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF CATASTROPHE INSURANCE ADJUSTER THAT IF THEY EXPERIENCE LARGE VOLUMES OF CLAIMS- FROM A SINGLE BETS FOR THOSE- THOSE CLAIMS ARE COVERED BY REINSURANCE THEY PAY THE CLAIMS AND THEN THE REINSURER REIMBURSES THEM BASED ON THOSE CLAIMS. AND IF THERE'S- FAULT FOUND FOR THE FIRE THEN THAT IS A DEEP POCKET THAT HELPS KEEP THE- THE COMPANY'S OF FLOTUS WELLS AT CORRECT. ABSOLUTELY THERE I THINK THE TOTAL THAT WAS PAID ON THE MERCED THE STATE WAS SEVENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN CLAIMS AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT SEVENTY NINE BILL HAS BEEN RECOVERED FROM PG&amp;E. AND THOSE RECOVERIES ALONG WITH THE CASH THAT. OUR OFFICE HAS INVESTED FOR MERCED- WILL IT IF IT IF IT WON'T MAKE EVERYONE HOLE IT'LL MAKE EVERYONE. WITHIN 5% OF WHOLE.
