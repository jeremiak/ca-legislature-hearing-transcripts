THIS HOUSE LOST ITS SUIT IT'S TWO THIRDS MAJORITY. SEVENTY EIGHT THAT WAS YOUR PROP THIRTEEN THE TAX REVOLT. SO TOM HANNIGAN IN PUBLIC SERVICE COMING OUT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

TOM WAS A WAS A REAL THOUGHTFUL INDIVIDUAL COURSE HE SERVES A CHAIR REVENUE TAX. FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. THEN BECOMING MAJORITY LEADER. AND I CAN SAY YOU KNOW HE'S THAT PERSON IS FOR PERSONIFIES WHAT WE YOU'VE ALL HEARD THE LINE ABOUT THE DOC. WHO IS PADDLING FURIOUSLY ACROSS THE LAKE BUT LOOK SO SERENE ON TOP? SOMEHOW HE MANAGED. TO POKE HIS HEAD IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. TO BE IN A TIME OF CONTENTIOUS ISSUES. AND YET RETAIN A CALM ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS WORK. AND TO PERSEVERE. IN PUBLIC SERVICES TO HAVE CELLS AND REPUTATION.
