EXCITING JOB IT'S NOT WHAT I

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:05.381

I THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY THIS

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:29.272
WOULD NOT BE A CHOICE THAT I

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:30.673

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.155

THAT. AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:53.262
WHAT THIS BILL SAYS. IT DOES

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:54.497
NOT GET THESE PEOPLE MINIMUM

WAS ALWAYS BEING PRESSURED

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.545
WHICH WAS CAUSING A GREAT DEAL

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:39.915
OF ANXIETY AND STRESS. AT THE

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:40.516
TIME SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:44.320

DAYS WHEN SHE'S FORCED TO FOR

DOCTORS OR WHAT HAVE YOU. THIS

01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:00.836
CENTER MIGHT BE KNOWN AS A

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:04.440
SHELTERED CENTER. AND IT IS

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:06.609
PLAIN LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE TO

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:09.211
CRYSTAL AND MANY LIKE HER IT IS

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:12.948
SO MUCH MORE. IT IS THEIR LIFE

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.517
LIKE I SAID NOW SHE NEVER

MISSES A DAY WORK SHE NEVER

COMES HOME CRYING OR ANXIOUS OR

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:21.323
DEPRESSED. SHE GETS HER FANS

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.692

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:25.895
EASIER FOR THE NEXT DAY SHE

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:27.630
COMES HOME WITH A SMILE OR

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.565
SMILE LARGER THAN THE GRAND

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:31.500
CANYON WHEN SHE HAD FACT

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.869
CHECKED. CRYSTAL DOES NOT

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:35.905
UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF MONEY.

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:37.873
BUT SHE DOES UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:42.111
THAT TECHNIQUE. THANK YOU SO

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.986
HER MONEY THAT SHE HAS EARNED.

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:54.523

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:59.295
WHEN KRISTA WAS BORN THE

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:00.696
DOCTORS TOLD ME SHE MUST BE

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:03.198
INSTITUTIONALIZED THAT IS THE

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:05.901
BEST PLACE FOR HER. THAT IS NOT

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:08.003
THE BEST PLACE FOR SHE'S

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:10.372
WORKING IN OUR COMMUNITY IT

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:12.274
MIGHT BE A SHELTERED COMMUNITY.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:13.876
I MIGHT BE PAYING A LITTLE BIT

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:16.879
LESS. BUT IT'S HER COMMUNITY

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:20.316
AND HAS HER JOB THAT SHE WAKES

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.151

THRIVE IN A PALE PLACE THAT

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:37.199
MEETS THE NEEDS AND ALLOWS THEM

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.968

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:35.457
OBLIGATION THAT WE CORRECTLY

ARE GOING TO FEAR THAT THEY'RE

01:11:58.514 --> 01:11:59.515
GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOB. B. WE

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:00.849
ARE TRYING TO GET THEM UP TO A

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.584

FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND WE

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:06.188
PICKED THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:08.457
ARE ALREADY PROBABLY STRESS

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:09.058
WITH A LOT OF THINGS IN THEIR

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:12.327
LIVES. WITH THE- NOTION OR THE

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:15.264
FEAR. THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:16.165
WHICH IS MEANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:17.733
PROVIDE THEM. ADDITIONAL INCOME

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.234
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO BE ABLE

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:20.035
TO TAKE THAT OUT INTO THE

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:21.770
COMMUNITY. THAT SOMEHOW THEY'RE

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:22.805
GOING TO LOSE SOMETHING FROM

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:25.574
THAT- THAT THAT ARGUMENT IS

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:26.542
THAT WEALTHY ON ON SEVERAL

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:28.811
LEVELS. AND I HOPE THIS IS THE

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:29.812
KIND OF WORK ALSO THAT

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.280
CATALYZES SOME INTEREST AT THE

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:32.715
FEDERAL LEVEL. TO BE ABLE TO

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:34.116
READ IS THIS AS WELL AS THE

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.218
OTHER STATES ARE STARTING TO.

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:36.785
GO IN THIS DIRECTION I THINK

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:40.089
THAT'S IMPORTANT- AND- YOU KNOW

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.757
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE SETTING THE

01:12:41.824 --> 01:12:43.826
CLOCK TODAY- OR THAT HIS PASSES

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:45.427
AND BECOMES LAW. NOT THAT WE

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:46.929
NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT WITHIN

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.130
THREE YEARS I KNOW THAT'S%

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.898
AGGRESSIVE BUT ATTAINABLE AND

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:52.334
SO WE SHOULD BE HEADING DOWN

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:53.702
THIS PATH WE SHOULD MAKE SURE

01:12:53.769 --> 01:12:54.803
BECAUSE THE WORK HAS TO GET

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.238
DONE WHETHER. YOU'RE STOCKING

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:58.540
SHELVES- SOMEBODY'S GOING TO

01:12:58.607 --> 01:12:59.975
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WORK

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.043
AND THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BE

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:03.712
PAID. A FAIR WAGE AT LEAST A

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:06.482
MINIMUM WAGE- AND SO OVER THE

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:07.382
COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.617
I IMAGINE WE WILL BE.

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:09.718
CONTINUING TO MONITOR THIS VERY

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:10.652
CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THE

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.588
PROTECTIONS ARE THERE. SO THAT

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:13.922
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FEARFUL

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:15.657
THAT THEIR EMPLOYER MIGHT BE

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.726
USING THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAINST

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.361
THEM. THAT THAT WE ARE THERE TO

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:21.029
STAND UP FOR THEM TO. THAT

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:21.663
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE THEIR

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.132
JOB WE WILL WELL I THINK WE

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.500
NEED TO STAY CLOSE ON THIS

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:25.768
ISSUE AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:26.902
IT SO THAT THERE ARE NO.

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.270
ADVERSE IMPACT THAT THAT WE'RE

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.205
MEETING THAT- IMPORTANT GOALS

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:31.540

SUPERVISE THEM BECAUSE THAT

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:18.146

CAN HIRE SOMEBODY WITH THE

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.814
NORTH DISABILITIES HONDA- CAN

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.584
PRODUCE SO- EXPECTED INSTEAD OF

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:58.186
STANDARD THE WALK POLITY SO-

01:15:58.253 --> 01:16:00.088
EVEN SO INTENT IS ARE HELPING

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:02.824
THEM. OUT WITH A MORE PAID BUT

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.060
THE FOR THE LONG RUN THIS MAY

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:07.429
BE DUE SERVICES TO THEM BECAUSE

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:09.564
OF SUCH A JOB OPPORTUNITY MAY

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:17.606
BE DIMINISHED. WHEN I THINK

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:19.541
ABOUT THAT. WELL I'M- TIMES

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:20.309
THAT ONLY WAY SOMEBODY COULD

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:22.277
GET AT LEAST. THE MINIMUM WAGE

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:24.947
THE OR CAN'T GET MINIMUM WAGE

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.949
IS BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THEIR-

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:29.851
DISABILITY I'M SADDENED BY THAT

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:31.820
I THINK THAT WE AS A SOCIETY

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:34.022
NEED TO CHANGE OUR ATTITUDES

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:36.058
TOWARDS THOSE WHO ARE DIFFERENT

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:38.026
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT POTENTIAL

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:39.761
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SKILLS THEY

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:40.963
ARE A DIFFERENT HUMAN BEING

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.764
JUST LIKE YOU AND ME WE DON'T

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:44.399
HAVE THE SAME WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:46.001
SAME SKILLS WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.869
SAME LIFE EXPERIENCES BUT WE

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:50.439
EXPECT TO BE TREATED IN SOME

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:52.507
FUNDAMENTAL WAYS THE SAME. AND

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.242
SO WHAT I'M TRYING TODO HERE

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:55.811
IS SAY THAT ALL THESE

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.512
INDIVIDUALS WE NEED TO GIVE

01:16:57.579 --> 01:16:59.348
THEM THE OPPORTUNITY AND BREAK

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:02.017
DOWN THESE ATTITUDINAL BARRIERS

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:04.219
THAT WE FACE THAT THEY FACE I'M

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.254
SADDENED TO HEAR OF THE YOUNG

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:07.756
WOMAN AND ALL THE PRESSURE AND

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:09.691
THE STRESS AND THE ATTITUDES

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:11.727
AGAINST HER IN HER WORKPLACE

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.462
BUT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:15.497
IS NOT BY PAYING THEM LESS. THE

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:17.799
WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS BY

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:19.735
MAKING SURE THAT THE RESPECT

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.737
FOR CIVIL RIGHTS ARE WE ARE

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:22.671
THAT OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ARE

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.506
RESPECTED THAT'S THE WAY TO

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:27.342
DEAL WITH THAT SO I DON'T THINK

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:29.611
THAT WE SHOULD MEASURE A PERSON

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:31.079
AND SAY WELL THEY'RE DISTANT

01:17:31.146 --> 01:17:33.048
DISABLE SO THEREFORE THEY DON'T

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:35.751
DESERVE EVEN THE MINIMUM WAGE

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:37.185
THAT'S NOT CORRECT THAT'S NOT

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.154
RIGHT AND I THINK WE AS A CUT

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:42.124
OF THE STATE STAND FOR. LIFTING

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:44.526
EVERYONE UP AND WE HAVE WE ARE

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:46.061
PUTTING THE RESOURCES ON THE

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:48.397
PRACTICAL SIDE WE ARE PUTTING

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:49.531
TENS OF MILLIONS OF THE

01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:50.932
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.968
INTO THE RESOURCES BOTH FOR

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.703
EMPLOYERS AND FOR ALL THE

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.538
SERVICES THAT ARE SISTERS THE

01:17:56.605 --> 01:17:58.840
BROTHERS WERE DISABLED NEED AND

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:01.943
DESERVE SO- I JUST DON'T THINK

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:04.046
THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT TREATING

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:06.114
PEOPLE ON THE ON THE ISSUE OF A

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:10.085
JOB. THEY SHOULD GET PAID JUST

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:10.652
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. YEAH I

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:11.453
HEAR YOU KNOW YOU ARE

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.321
APPROACHING FROM THE HUMAN

EMOTION ON HUMANOS SYMPATHY

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.993
ASPECT HOWEVER. NOT ALL THE

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.528
BUSINESS PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:20.595
IT THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT THEY

01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:22.497
WOULD LOOK AT STUFF. IN A

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:24.966
COMBINATION OF- THAT ASPECT AT

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:26.568
THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING BUT AT

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:28.670
THE SAME TIME FROM OUR-

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.439
STANDPOINT OVER HIS- HIS A

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:33.141
BUSINESS. YOU HEARD THE MANY

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:36.378
MANY. PARENTS AND INDIVIDUALS

DO NOT AGREE WITH YOUR SUPPORT

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:45.654
AND THAT THEY ALL POLL STUFF.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.489
SO ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL THE

THE PRESSURE ON SOME OF THESE

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:08.870
SITUATIONS TO CLOSE AND GO OUT

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:10.305
OF BUSINESS IS PRETTY PRETTY

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:12.741
GREAT SO WE'RE SEEING. LESS AND

01:20:12.807 --> 01:20:14.276
LESS OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:15.177
AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:17.412
THESE DAYS. BUT THERE ARE STILL

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:19.147
WE BELIEVE AROUND TWELVE

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:19.981
THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO STILL

TODAY. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:24.252
OPPORTUNITY. AND WHAT WE'RE

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.021
SEEING IS THAT WHEN THEY LEAVE

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.023
THE WORKFORCE. THEY TYPICALLY

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:30.091
AREN'T FINDING A MINIMUM WAGE

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:32.027

DO TRANSITION SUCCESSFULLY THAT

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:38.300
WAY. NOT MANY BECAUSE MANY

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:39.935
TIMES TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE AT

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:40.402
THE LOWER END OF THE

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:42.270
PRODUCTIVITY SCALE. IN THOSE

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:43.872
PEOPLE TYPICALLY END UP IN A

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:46.775
DAY PROGRAM. WHICH COSTS THE

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:47.809
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ODDLY

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:50.178
ENOUGH. ABOUT THREE TIMES AS

01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:51.246
MUCH MONEY IN TERMS OF THE

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:52.747
PAYMENTS OF WHAT. THE STATE

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:55.750
PAYS RATE WISE. THAN THEY DO TO

01:20:55.817 --> 01:20:57.285
A WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAM THE

01:20:57.352 --> 01:20:59.287
COMPARISON IS ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.088
DOLLARS TO THIRTY DOLLARS A

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:02.524
DAY. PER PERSON SO IF YOU DID

THE LITERAL MATH. AND SAID YOU

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.328
KNOW ALL TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:21:06.394 --> 01:21:08.430
IN INTO A DAY PROGRAM. INSTEAD

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:11.766
ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:13.635
MILLION DOLLARS. OUR CONCERN ON

THIS OVERALL IS THAT WE LOVE

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:16.071
THE IDEA OF HER BY MOVING TO

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:18.006
MINIMUM WAGE. AND THIS BILL

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:19.241
CREATES A PROCESS TO HAVE THAT

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:21.443
CONVERSATION. BUT IT HAS THAT

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:22.777
SLEDGEHAMMER TERMINATION DATE

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.346
IN IT. WITHOUT HAVING A

A PROGRAM TELL YOU HOW THEY'RE

THEY'RE GIVING ABOUT 25%

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:17.065
PRODUCTIVITY OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:18.533
TO EMPLOY MORE TO BE ABLE TO

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.602

IS THE FUNDING FOR THE

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:25.006
BUSINESS- OWNER TO COMPENSATE-

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.308
WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

REACH THE PRODUCTIVITY THAT

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:37.052
THEY NEED. WELL JUST THIS

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:39.287
LEGISLATURE ALONE IS ALREADY

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:41.923
INVESTING AND ADDING TO. THE

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.892
AMOUNT OF MONEY- TO MAKEA

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:45.560
SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:46.928
INDIVIDUALS WILL BE OUT OF

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.730
THESE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS AS I

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.265
SAID EARLIER. THERE IS AN

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.733
ADDITIONAL SIXTY ONE MILLION

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.201
DOLLARS FOR REGIONAL CENTER

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.036
SERVICE COORDINATORS. WHO ARE

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:56.071
GOING TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:58.440
MOVING OUT OF THE WORKSHOPS. WE

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:00.108
HAVE WE'RE INVESTING IN THESE

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:01.076
COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:02.811
EMPLOYMENT. DOUBLING THE

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:04.546
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO SERVICE

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:06.815
PROVIDERS. I MEAN THERE THOSE

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:08.616
ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF THE

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.051
STATE LEVEL AND THERE'S ALSO

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:13.221
FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE. SO

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:14.723
THAT THE FUNDING IS THERE THE

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:15.590
QUESTION IS HOW WILL IT BE

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:18.727
USED. AND I ABSOLUTELY HAVE

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:20.762
ENORMOUS RESPECT AND ADMIRATION

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.330

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:25.333
CALLED IN. WHO ARE UP P A

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.104
DISABLED HAVE A DISABILITY- AND

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:31.139
AS YOU HEARD. THERE ARE THOSE

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.741
WHO SAY THEY SUPPORT AND THERE

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:33.842
ARE THOSE WHO SAY THEY DON'T

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:36.778
SUPPORT. I HOPE. THAT YOU KNOW

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:39.581
THIS IS NOT- IS NOT THIS IT'S

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.015
NOT BECAUSE SHOULDN'T BE FACING

01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:43.818
THIS FEAR. THAT AN EMPLOYER IS

01:23:43.885 --> 01:23:45.120
GOING TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:47.255
THEM. THAT SHOULD NOT EXIST WE

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:48.857
SHOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.859
IN CALIFORNIA. THAT SOMEBODY

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:52.093
DOESN'T GET HIRED BECAUSE

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.595
THEY'RE BEING DISCRIMINATED

01:23:53.661 --> 01:23:54.929
AGAINST. THAT'S WHAT ALL OF

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:57.132
OUR- CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS HAVE

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:58.533
BEEN ABOUT THAT SOMEBODY

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.001
DOESN'T GET DISCRIMINATED

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:00.935
AGAINST BECAUSE OF WHO THEY

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:03.371
ARE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:06.374
OF MAKE SURE HAPPENS- AS THEY

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:09.878
GET INTEGRATED. INTO DIFFERENT-

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:11.312
WORKPLACES. THANK YOU I JUST

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.647
JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:13.982
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT I

01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:15.650
THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT WE

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:17.852
HAVE THE FUNDING. BUT IT HASN'T

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:19.587
BEEN DESIGNATED AND

01:24:19.654 --> 01:24:20.989
UNFORTUNATELY WE WATCH THIS

01:24:21.055 --> 01:24:22.590
BEFORE WHERE WE HAVE THE

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:23.124
FUNDING BUT IT'S NOT GOING

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:24.893
WHERE THE FUNDING IS. WE PUT

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.528
THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE WHERE

01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:27.495
IS I'D LIKE TO SEE WHERE THE

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:29.030
FUND IS GOING WORDS THERE IN

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.198
WRITING SAYING THIS IS WHAT'S

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:31.299
GOING TO THE BUSINESS THIS IS

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:33.301
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. SO THAT I

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:34.969
KNOW THAT WHEN I VOTE ON

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.638
SOMETHING LIKE THIS I KNOW THAT

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:37.806
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:24:37.872 --> 01:24:39.741
ACTUALLY- THEY HANDLE THIS BILL

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.576
IS GOING TO BE UP IN PROTECTIVE

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:43.011
BAIL. AND IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT

01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:44.279
EVERYONE IT'S SO THAT'S MY

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:45.680
CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS JUST

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.348
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE MONEY AND

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:48.316
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S IN THE PAST

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:49.317
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO GO

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:52.720
WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO. SO I DO

PEOPLE OVERNIGHT WITHOUT JOBS

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.940

AN UNFAIR PARALLEL. THE

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.401

OFFERED TO THE REGIONAL CENTER

THIS STATE SEVEN YEARS AGO WITH

01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:23.771
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHESBRO WAS IN

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:26.841
YOUR SAME SEAT- BASICALLY IN

01:32:26.908 --> 01:32:29.143
THE LEGISLATURE. HE PASSED A

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.012
BILL THAT COMMITTED THE STATE

01:32:31.078 --> 01:32:32.413
OF CALIFORNIA TO BE CALLED AN

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.249

PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:38.219
DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. I WAS

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:38.819
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHEN IN

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:40.888
FACT JANUARY FIRST. TWO

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:43.057
THOUSAND FOURTEEN. HERE WE ARE

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:44.859
SEVEN YEARS LATER. AND THE

01:32:44.926 --> 01:32:46.994
EMPLOYMENT RATE OF OUR

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.996
POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE WITH

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:50.064
INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:51.365
DISABILITIES IS EXACTLY THE

01:32:51.432 --> 01:32:54.669
SAME. WE SAT A MADE IN THE

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:57.171
STATE THE TOP PRIORITY FOR ALL

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:58.205
PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL

01:32:58.272 --> 01:32:59.040
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:01.042
EMPLOYMENT FIRST THAT'S THE

01:33:01.108 --> 01:33:02.043
FIRST THING WE SHOULD DO FOR

01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:04.011
THEM AND YET OUR EMPLOYMENT

01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:07.048
RATE IS STILL AT 14% THE SAME

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:10.718
AS IT WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO. AND

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:11.319
NINE POINTS BELOW THE NATIONAL

01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:14.255
AVERAGE. THE NATIONAL AVERAGE

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:14.855
FOR THIS POPULATION IS TWENTY

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.824
THREE PERCENT. CALIFORNIA'S AT

01:33:16.891 --> 01:33:19.293
FOURTEEN. NOW IT AND WE HAVE NO

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.895
DISCOMFORT WITH ANYTHING IN

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:22.697
THIS BILL. IN TERMS OF THE

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:24.265
PROCESS TO COME UP WITH A GREAT

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:26.567
PLAN. BUT HAVING THE

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:28.336
TERMINATION DATE SET OUT THERE

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:30.604
AS PART OF THAT WITHOUT THE

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:33.341
PLAN. IS THE PROBLEM. AND SO

01:33:33.407 --> 01:33:34.342
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING I THINK

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.410
IS RIGHT PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:38.479
ARE IN THEIR JOBS TODAY DEVELOP

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:40.548
A GREAT PLAN. AND THEN WHEN YOU

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:41.983
GET THAT PLAN COME BACK AND

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:42.750
TELL US WHAT IT IS AND HOW

01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:44.685
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT. IF YOU

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:45.319
GUYS WANT TO MAKE THE LEAP THEN

01:33:45.386 --> 01:33:47.388
YOU SHOULD DO IT. BUT I HAVE

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:49.490
SEEN THIS MOVIE FOR MANY YEARS

01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:50.858
AND WE'RE JUST NOT DOING A

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:53.127
GREAT JOB. WHATEVER MONEY WE

01:33:53.194 --> 01:33:55.363
PUT INTO THOSE OF EMPLOYING

01:33:55.429 --> 01:33:57.365
THIS POPULATION. THIS BILL

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:58.799
LITERALLY WOULD KNOCK IN THREE

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:00.701
YEARS. TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:34:00.768 --> 01:34:01.902
OUT OF POSITIONS THAT THEY HAVE

01:34:01.969 --> 01:34:03.804
CHOSEN TO BE IN TODAY. THERE'S

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.506
NO GETTING AROUND THAT YOUR

01:34:05.573 --> 01:34:06.607
CHOICE THEN IS THEY WILL EITHER

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:09.043
BE. GIVEN MINIMUM WAGE TO STAY

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:12.380
IN THAT OR ANOTHER JOB. SOMEHOW

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:14.148
THERE'S NOTHING THAT SPECIFIES

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:14.882
HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK YOU COULD

01:34:14.949 --> 01:34:17.018
SUBSIDIZES. THE STATE COULD SAY

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:18.052
WE'RE GONNA COME FOR THE POT OF

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:20.321
MONEY AND FILL THE GAP BETWEEN

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:22.189
THE PERSONS FOURTEEN SEE WAGE.

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:24.625
AND THE WAY TO THE EMPLOYERS

01:34:24.692 --> 01:34:25.126
GOING TO PAYING WHICH IS

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:26.727
MINIMAL WE COULD DO THAT.

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:27.762
THEY'RE BENT TO BILLS IN THE

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:29.296
PAST THAT OFFERED A TAX CREDIT

01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:32.333
TO EMPLOYERS. ON THAT SPREAD

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.367
WHICH WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:35.803
EMPLOYERS TO SWALLOW SOMEBODY

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:36.771
WHO'S AT A LOWER PRODUCTIVITY

01:34:36.837 --> 01:34:38.906
LEVEL BUT WE KILL BOTH OF THOSE

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:41.142
BILLS. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:41.909
LOWER THE PROP NINETY EIGHT

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:44.145
BASE IN THE STATE. SO THERE ARE

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:45.613
IDEAS AND WAYS TO GET OF THIS

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:46.747
WE'RE TOTALLY OPEN TO BEING A

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:48.416
PART OF THAT. I WILL TELL YOU

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:50.384
THAT I AM PLEASED. THAT CENTER

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:52.386
DORADO ADDED SOME OF THE PEOPLE

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:53.854
WHO DO FOURTEEN C. PROGRAMS

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.523
TODAY TO THE BILL IN TERMS OF

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:56.490
STAKEHOLDERS WHO WILL

01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:58.426
PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROCESS. I

01:34:58.492 --> 01:34:59.994
AM JUST OUR ORGANIZATION IS

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:01.695
ABSOLUTELY UNCOMFORTABLE

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:03.164
KILLING OFF THOSE JOBS UNTIL WE

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:04.532
HAVE THE PLAN. YOU COULD

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:05.900

THIS ISSUE REALLY ON BOTH SIDES.

01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:30.524
AND TO THE WAY ADVOCACY GOES IS

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:33.327
SOMETIMES WE GET FOLKS WHO.

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:36.931
WORKED UP ABOUT AN ISSUE.

01:35:36.997 --> 01:35:38.799
PARTIAL INFORMATION AND I

01:35:38.866 --> 01:35:41.569
ALWAYS FIND THAT TO BE. SAD AND

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:43.838
POTENTIALLY USE. THEM BEEN

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:45.372
TALKING TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:47.675
ACROSS THE BOARD. ON THIS ISSUE

01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:50.010
AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:51.412
STATEMENT THAT I THINK WE HAVE

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:53.080
TO BE CAREFUL. ABOUT THE

01:35:53.147 --> 01:35:54.915
EMOTIONS AND FOR US WE NEED TO

01:35:54.982 --> 01:35:56.417
STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:58.119
THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE. AND

01:35:58.185 --> 01:35:59.854
WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED AND

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.022
TALKED ABOUT LOOKS LIKE ZERO

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:04.425
SON AND IT'S NOT ZERO SO.

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:05.659
THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:09.029
HERE. AND FOR MOST OF PEOPLE

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:10.030
I'VE INTERACTED WITH WITH

01:36:10.097 --> 01:36:12.833
DISABILITIES THAT JOB THAT

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:17.404
ABILITY TO WORK. EVEN AT NOT

01:36:17.471 --> 01:36:19.106
EXPECTED PRODUCTIVITY LEVEL.

01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:20.975
WHICH AGAIN IS A POTENTIAL PATH

01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:23.878
TO A FALSE CHOICE. THE PRICE

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:25.146
THEY GET FOR DOING THAT WORK

01:36:25.212 --> 01:36:26.647
THE DIGNITY GET FOR DOING THAT

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:28.649
WORK AND ENGAGEMENT IS WHAT IS

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:31.819
MOST SIGNIFICANT. AND IF WHAT

01:36:31.886 --> 01:36:32.353
WE'RE GOING TO SAY IS THE

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:34.788
STANDARD. FOR SOMEONE

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:37.057
DISABILITIES IS THE SAME AS

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:39.460
SOMEONE WITHOUT DISABILITIES WE

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:41.428
END UP WITH THOSE FOLKS CHOICES.

01:36:41.495 --> 01:36:43.330
SO WE HAVE TO COME TO AN ERROR

01:36:43.397 --> 01:36:45.666
IT SOME OF THE THESE LAWS GO

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:47.067
BACK TO IT AS WE HAVE BEEN

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:50.671
SATED FDR. AND YES WESTLEY JUST

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:54.041
BROKE. THE LAW SEVEN YEARS AGO

01:36:54.108 --> 01:36:55.342
THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO MOVE THE

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:56.644
NEEDLE UNEMPLOYMENT SO

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:59.780
SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE IT THIS

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:01.215
IS A GOOD STEP AND A GOOD

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:04.685
RECOGNITION. OF WHAT THAT

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.654
CHANGE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.721
PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:09.256
DIGNITY BECAUSE I CANNOT

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:11.125
BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:13.928
DOING WORK IN AN ORGANIZATION.

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:15.563
THAT IS BEING PAID. SUB MINIMUM

01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:16.864
WAGE AND REMEMBER WE'RE

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:18.199
ACTUALLY NOT TALKING ABOUT SUB

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:20.534
MINIMUM CALIFORNIA WAY. FEDERAL

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:21.936
WAGE WHICH IS STILL SEVEN

01:37:22.002 --> 01:37:24.038
DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS ABOUT.

01:37:24.104 --> 01:37:24.672
A LOT OF THESE FOLKS PERFORMING

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:28.275
THESE JOBS. ARE GETTING SUB.

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:30.411
MINIMUM WAGE WELL BELOW WHAT WE

01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:30.911
WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:37:30.978 --> 01:37:32.346
LEGISLATURE WE WANT TO GIVE GET

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.582
PEOPLE AWAY. AND IN ANY

01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:36.250
ORGANIZATION THERE ARE

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:36.684
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:40.521
PRODUCTIVITY. SO WE CAN'T BE

01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:42.489
SAYING BECAUSE WE DON'T VALUE

01:37:42.556 --> 01:37:44.024
YOU YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE SOME

01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:46.193
MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT'S

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.495
ULTIMATELY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:50.431
BUT TAKE A DEEP BREATH. TAKE A

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:52.466

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:33.540
APPROPRIATELY. RECOGNIZING WHAT

01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:34.975

GETTING DEPARTMENT TO DO GAP

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.116
ANALYSIS. THAT WAS DUE BY A

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:18.118
CERTAIN DAY WE STILL DON'T HAVE

01:39:18.185 --> 01:39:21.488
IT REXY TAKING. ACTION ON SOME

01:39:21.555 --> 01:39:22.823
OF THOSE GAPS WITHOUT THE HELP

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:24.925
THAT HELPS HAVE BEEN DONE FINE

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:26.293

BEYOND WHAT APPEARS TO BE. A

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:35.536
ZERO SUM. IT ULTIMATELY FALLS

01:39:35.602 --> 01:39:38.839
CHOICES. AND REALLY SET UP.

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:41.241

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:45.045
WOULD RATHER SEE THE PLAN.

01:39:45.112 --> 01:39:47.648
BEFORE FINAL ACTION GETS TAKEN.

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:49.717

BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:56.523
OPPORTUNITIES IN APPROACH FROM

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:58.859
THE FLOOR. TO GET THIS RIGHT

BECAUSE IF WE DON'T. SET UP

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:02.396
THAT TRANSITION PROCESS AND

01:40:02.463 --> 01:40:05.099
APPROPRIATE WAY. IT'S HARD TO

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:06.867
KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:09.870
AND I DON'T BUY INTO THE FEAR

01:40:09.937 --> 01:40:11.438

AREN'T. WORKING THE WAY WE

01:40:17.911 --> 01:40:19.980

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.225
EQUITABLE THAT'S JUST. BUT

01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:32.426

OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY I HAVE

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:45.466
FOUR SIBLINGS OF SPECIAL NEEDS

01:41:45.532 --> 01:41:46.099
INCLUDING A LITTLE BROTHER WITH

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:48.902
CEREBRAL PALSY- AND I THINK

01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:50.704
THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.474
VALUES AT STAKE IN THIS BILL.

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:54.374
ONE OF THEM IS THAT WE DON'T

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:55.309
DISCRIMINATE ON IMMUTABLE

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:57.578
CHARACTERISTICS WE DON'T PAY

01:41:57.644 --> 01:41:58.212
MEN LAST BECAUSE WOMEN ARE MORE

01:41:58.278 --> 01:42:01.248
PRODUCTIVE. MY WE DON'T PAY

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:02.950
WHITE FOLKS LESS BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:42:03.016 --> 01:42:04.918
OF COLOR MORE PRODUCTIVE. WE

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:06.086
DON'T DISCRIMINATE ON IMMUTABLE

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:07.654
CHARACTERISTICS AND THAT'S AN

01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:08.455
IMPORTANT VALUE TO HOLD I

01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:10.224
THINK. MY COLLEAGUE ALSO

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.492
MENTION THAT WE ARE TALKING

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:13.026
ABOUT PAYING BELOW THE FEDERAL

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:14.995

ALSO MEANS THAT PAYING PEOPLE A

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:09.049
SUB MINIMUM WAGE LIKE TWO

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:11.018

02:06:09.161 --> 02:06:09.695
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:11.297
PERHAPS THINKING. GREAT YOU

02:06:11.363 --> 02:06:12.698
NEVER GONNA GIVE THIS THOUSAND

02:06:12.765 --> 02:06:13.899
DOLLARS AND YOU COULD PUT IT

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:15.367
TOWARDS YOUR HOUSING YOU COULD

02:06:15.434 --> 02:06:16.969
PORTED TOWARDS YOUR BOOKS YOU

02:06:17.036 --> 02:06:18.537
CAN PUT IT TOWARDS YOU KNOW

02:06:18.604 --> 02:06:19.338
PAYING YOUR INSURANCE BUT

02:06:19.405 --> 02:06:21.206
THERE'S A PLACE LIKE A CATEGORY

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:23.142
OR SOMETHING. BECAUSE I THINK

02:06:23.208 --> 02:06:24.476
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE

02:06:24.543 --> 02:06:25.411
THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO

02:06:25.477 --> 02:06:26.979
BE UTILIZED WHERE WHERE IT

02:06:27.046 --> 02:06:28.881
NEEDS TO BE AND YOU KNOW WITH

02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:30.416
GOOD FAITH OF THE ASSUMING

02:06:30.482 --> 02:06:31.283
GOING WHERE WE'RE GOING TO

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:32.952
EXPECT THESE PEOPLE TO KNOW.

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.019
YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN YOU'RE

02:06:34.086 --> 02:06:35.154
GROWING UP EVEN WHEN YOU'RE IN

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:38.023
YOUR EARLY TWENTIES WHETHER

02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:38.624
YOU'RE AT A FOSTER HOME YOU'RE

02:06:38.691 --> 02:06:39.224
NOT. THEY'RE NOT TAUGHT THE

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:40.359
SKILLS SOMETIMES A REALLY

02:06:40.426 --> 02:06:41.226
KNOWING WE IN A WIDE

02:06:41.293 --> 02:06:42.328
COMMONSENSE WE REALLY SHOULD BE

02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:43.562
PUTTING IN HERE TO A GIRL

02:06:43.629 --> 02:06:44.897
LITTLE BIT OLDER WE REALIZE.

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.298
OKAY I SHOULD SAVE MY MONEY OR

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:48.067
PAY MY BILLS FIRST BEFORE I GO

02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:49.802
IN I HAVE FUN. SO I THINK

02:06:49.868 --> 02:06:51.503
THAT'S JUST IT I. IT'S NOT THE

02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:53.839
MONEY. IT'S JUST MAKING IT SO

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:55.074
THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE OPTIONS%

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.942
AND GOOD CHOICES FOR DOUBTS OF

02:06:57.009 --> 02:06:57.876
THE UNDERSTAND THAT'S HOW YOU

02:06:57.943 --> 02:06:59.878
TRAIN THEM. GOING GREAT THIS IS

02:06:59.945 --> 02:07:01.180
A GREAT PLACE I'M GONNA PUT IT.

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:02.614
TOWARDS A HOUSING ART. TO

02:07:02.681 --> 02:07:04.750
TBILISI OR MAYBE IT'S A CAR.

02:07:04.817 --> 02:07:05.985
YOU KNOW IN MAKING A PAYMENT

02:07:06.051 --> 02:07:07.486
BUT IF WE GIVE THEM-

02:07:07.553 --> 02:07:09.355
COMMONSENSE OPTIONS TO PUT THE

02:07:09.421 --> 02:07:10.489
MONEY IN WE COULD SEE THE

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:11.523
MONEY'S BEING USED. YOU KNOW

02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:13.325
RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S MY ONLY

02:07:13.392 --> 02:07:14.693
CONCERN IS THAT IT'S REALLY UP

02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:16.195
TO THEIR DISCRETION. AND THAT

02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:17.062
WE COULD HELP THEM ALONG

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:19.098
EDUCATE THEM AS WELL. AND HOW

02:07:19.164 --> 02:07:20.966
TO BE- YOU KNOW. WHEN IT COMES

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:22.534
FINANCES BEING GOOD YOU KNOW BE

02:07:22.601 --> 02:07:25.938
LIKEGOOD IDEAS GOOD LEADERS

02:07:26.005 --> 02:07:26.872
WHEN IT COMES FINANCES. WELL

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:29.174
ONE THING SETS. BACK IN. BILL

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:31.143
FINALLY RE. THINGS OF BUILT IN.

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:34.546
OF THE- IS OF. THE VSS WILL.

02:07:34.613 --> 02:07:36.749
WILL WORK- WITHOUT PRESCRIBING

02:07:36.815 --> 02:07:39.018
A TO WORK TO MAKE AVAILABLE. OF

02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:40.419
CREDIT COUNSELING FINANCIAL

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:42.354
COUNSELING MENTORSHIP. OF

02:07:42.421 --> 02:07:44.390
NUMBER PROGRAMS. PART OF THOSE

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:45.691
IDEAS CAME. YOU KNOW WERE

02:07:45.758 --> 02:07:47.659
INCUBATED- AT THE COUNTY LEVEL

02:07:47.726 --> 02:07:48.861
WHERE IT'S EASIER TO TEST THOSE

02:07:48.927 --> 02:07:52.631
THINGS. WITHOUT REQUIRING IT.

02:07:52.698 --> 02:07:55.067
BECAUSE THE THOUGHT HEARING

02:07:55.134 --> 02:07:56.201
THERE IS A PHILOSOPHY IN A- I

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:58.470
WILL KNOWLEDGE SAID. SOME MAY

02:07:58.537 --> 02:08:00.172
NOT BUY INTO IT OR NOT BUY INTO

02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:02.641
IT YET- THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:04.576
FOR YEARS AND YEARS. IS TRIED

02:08:04.643 --> 02:08:06.445
TO BE VERY VERY PRESCRIPTIVE.

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:08.547
WITH SOCIAL SERVICE- WITH

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:11.050
SOCIAL SERVICES- WITH THIS

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:13.952
POPULATION. AND WE FAIL- 50% OF

02:08:14.019 --> 02:08:15.421
THEM ARE NOT GRADUATING. HIGH

02:08:15.487 --> 02:08:16.889
SCHOOL SO NOW. THEY'RE

02:08:16.955 --> 02:08:19.024
LAUNCHING INTO THIS. THIS ERA

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:21.593
OF EMANCIPATION WITHOUT EVEN. A

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:22.694
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR THOSE

02:08:22.761 --> 02:08:24.430
SKILLS THAT THEY NEED. WE THEN

02:08:24.496 --> 02:08:26.198
SAY. LOOK WE DON'T WANT YOU

02:08:26.265 --> 02:08:27.466
HOMELESS. SO WE'LL GIVE YOU A

02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:28.634
HOUSING VOUCHER BUT THEY DON'T

ALL NEED A HOUSING VOUCHER SOME

02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:32.538
DO AND SOME DON'T. IT'S OF THE

02:08:32.604 --> 02:08:33.372
DANGER. EVEN THOUGH I

02:08:33.439 --> 02:08:36.875
UNDERSTAND. YOU ARE SORT OF

02:08:36.942 --> 02:08:38.510
SUGGESTING. A FAIRLY. LENGTHY

02:08:38.577 --> 02:08:40.846
LIST. HI HERE YOU RIGHT AS TO.

02:08:40.913 --> 02:08:42.881
WHAT SUITABLE. EXPENDITURES

ARE- AT SOME POINT YOU. RUN THE

02:08:49.154 --> 02:08:50.189
RISK OF ESSENTIALLY. TOM UP AS

02:08:50.255 --> 02:08:52.391

TRANSITION USE THE MONEY THIS

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:03.569
WAY AND NOT ANOTHER WAY. IN OF

02:09:03.635 --> 02:09:06.271
COURSE WE DON'T REALLY DO THAT-

02:09:06.338 --> 02:09:07.973
SUCCESSFULLY. YOU KNOW WITH

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:10.042
MUCH OF OUR- QUOTE WELFARE

02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:12.511
SYSTEM OR SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEM

02:09:12.578 --> 02:09:14.446
WITH THAT. BY AND LARGE ARE

02:09:14.513 --> 02:09:15.781
SICK OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO

02:09:15.848 --> 02:09:17.549
DICTATE TO PEOPLE HOW THEY

02:09:17.616 --> 02:09:19.218
SHOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES. YOU

02:09:19.284 --> 02:09:20.819
DON'T HAVE BEEN A FAILURE IN

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:22.521
THIS STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:24.590
SO THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT

02:09:24.656 --> 02:09:26.558
IT'S SAYING- YOU YOU MAKE YOUR

02:09:26.625 --> 02:09:29.728
DECISIONS. BUT LIKE ADULTS WAS

02:09:29.795 --> 02:09:32.064
GONNA WORK A 100% THE TIME WITH

02:09:32.131 --> 02:09:34.600
EVERYONE WITHOUT MISTAKES NO

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:37.536
BUT- WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A

02:09:37.603 --> 02:09:42.474
HIGH BAR RIGHT NOW- TO BEAT OR

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:43.742
TO- TO REACH IN IN TERMS OF

02:09:43.809 --> 02:09:44.843
DOING BETTER THAN WE'RE ALREADY

02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:47.112
DOING. IN IN THE BEST EVIDENCE

02:09:47.179 --> 02:09:48.380
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THE

02:09:48.447 --> 02:09:49.581
SANTA CLARA COUNTY MALL DIDN'T

02:09:49.648 --> 02:09:53.185
DO ANYTHING TO SKEW THE RESULTS

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:54.920
SEVENTY TWO FOSTER YOUTH. I

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:56.989
THINK THAT ONE DROP OUT FOR

02:09:57.055 --> 02:09:59.925
GOOD REASON THE REST OF THEM-

02:09:59.992 --> 02:10:00.592
AFTER EUROPE ALL BEEN

02:10:00.659 --> 02:10:03.996
EVALUATED. WITH INDICATORS-

02:10:04.062 --> 02:10:06.131
PRESENT THAT THE BASED ON

02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:08.066
PREVIOUS BASELINE POPULATIONS

02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:09.434
OF STATE OUT OF INCARCERATION

02:10:09.501 --> 02:10:10.936
OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE

02:10:11.003 --> 02:10:12.304
NOT DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AND

02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:14.540
ARE NOT HOMELESS SO. IT SEEMS

02:10:14.606 --> 02:10:16.308
TO BE WORKING THIS IS A PILOT

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:18.043
TWO ONE EMPHASIZE THAT FOR

02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:20.279
THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED WHAT IF

02:10:20.345 --> 02:10:22.080
IT DOESN'T WORK ON A STATEWIDE

02:10:22.147 --> 02:10:26.185
LEVEL WELL. I THINK WILL BE

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:27.252
SUNSETTING- THE PROGRAM

02:10:27.319 --> 02:10:28.353
NOBODY'S GONNA WANT TO RENEW

02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:29.755
THE PROGRAM AT SUNSET AT THAT

02:10:29.821 --> 02:10:30.956
POINT I THINK THAT'S THE REAL

02:10:31.023 --> 02:10:33.592
SAFEGUARD. ULTIMATELY TO THE-

02:10:33.659 --> 02:10:34.326
TO THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE

02:10:34.393 --> 02:10:35.794
RAISING ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I

02:10:35.861 --> 02:10:37.529
DO APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS AND

02:10:37.596 --> 02:10:39.364
I DO AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S A

02:10:39.431 --> 02:10:40.966
THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. IS

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:42.768
THERE ANY WAY OF JUST YOU KNOW

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.570
KEEPING TRACK BUT AFTER YEAR-

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:45.971
INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THREE

02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:46.972
YEARS AND IT REALLY YOU KNOW IT

02:10:47.039 --> 02:10:48.140
IF THERE'S A PLACE OF SAYING

02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:49.308
VERY WHERE DID YOU PUT YOU KNOW

02:10:49.374 --> 02:10:50.375
BECAUSE THIS IS A GREAT STUDY

02:10:50.442 --> 02:10:51.677
PROGRAM WHERE IS IT THAT YOU

02:10:51.743 --> 02:10:52.911
DID. YOU KNOW PLACE YUR BODY

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:54.146
IT GET IF IT'S UP TO THEIR

02:10:54.213 --> 02:10:55.214
DISCRETION THERE SHOULD BE A

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.782
PROBLEM LET US KNOW YOU KNOW

02:10:56.848 --> 02:10:58.550
WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING IT. IN IN

02:10:58.617 --> 02:11:00.686
THERE IS A VALUATION BUILT IN

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:01.853
IN THERE IS VALUATION AT THE

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:04.289
ONE YOUR POINT- YEAH AND

02:11:04.356 --> 02:11:06.792
ALTHOUGH. WHAT I'M SAYING ABOUT

02:11:06.858 --> 02:11:08.560
BEING NON PRESCRIPTIVE SOUNDS

02:11:08.627 --> 02:11:10.596
LIKE MAYBE WE ARE GOING TO

02:11:10.662 --> 02:11:12.231
EVALUATE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

02:11:12.297 --> 02:11:14.199
WE WILL EVALUATE. IS SO THE

02:11:14.266 --> 02:11:16.501
IDEA OF NOT TELLING SOMEONE

02:11:16.568 --> 02:11:17.769
SPECIFICALLY WHETHER TO BUY

02:11:17.836 --> 02:11:19.905
SHOES OR BUY FOOD. IS WHAT WE

02:11:19.972 --> 02:11:22.207
WANT. BUT IT'S STILL OKAY TO

02:11:22.274 --> 02:11:23.508
ASKING AT THE END OF THE YEAR

02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:24.543
DID YOU BUY SHOES OR DID YOU

02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:26.411
BUY FOOD AND SO. WE'LL HAVE

02:11:26.478 --> 02:11:27.546
THOSE DATA POINTS ONE THE

02:11:27.613 --> 02:11:28.413
BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THIS

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:30.382

GOING TO DO. YOU BE I. WITH THE

02:11:34.686 --> 02:11:35.220
POPULATION- IT WOULD BE THIS.

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:37.356
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LIFETIME. OF

02:11:37.422 --> 02:11:39.191
AGGREGATED AND DISAGGREGATED

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:40.492
DATA ON THEM ALREADY IN OUR

02:11:40.559 --> 02:11:43.695

I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE-

03:14:04.733 --> 03:14:07.902
AVAILABILITY OF A CHILD CARE

03:14:07.969 --> 03:14:12.040
CENTERS- BUT THAT IN. THIS-

03:14:12.107 --> 03:14:16.711
IMPLEMENTATION- THE SUMMARY.

03:14:16.778 --> 03:14:19.848
SAYS SO IT SAYS THIS PROGRAM IS

03:14:19.914 --> 03:14:22.217
EXPANDING THE RANGE OF WHAT

03:14:22.283 --> 03:14:25.286
TYPE OF A CHILD CARE. AND EARLY

03:14:25.353 --> 03:14:28.423

AGENCY- CAN YOU DEFINE IN

03:14:36.898 --> 03:14:40.368
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM

03:14:40.435 --> 03:14:42.937
WILL THIS BE- EXPANDED GOT TO

03:14:43.004 --> 03:14:45.306
EXISTING PUBLIC SCHOOL RISK

03:14:45.373 --> 03:14:48.743
WHAT. BUY YOU A STATEMENT

03:14:48.810 --> 03:14:51.012
DOUBLE CONTRACTING AGENCY DOES

03:14:51.079 --> 03:14:53.648
THAT MEAN THAT OUTSIDE THE

03:14:53.715 --> 03:14:57.352
CONTRACTOR- WILL IT INCLUDE THE

03:14:57.419 --> 03:14:59.687

03:14:59.754 --> 03:15:02.357
WHO WILL BE DAHLE CONTRACTING

AGENCIES. THAT'S MY FIRST

03:15:04.459 --> 03:15:08.196
QUESTION AND THEN I ASSUME-

03:15:08.263 --> 03:15:10.932
THAT ANYONE TWO TO FOUR YEARS

03:15:10.999 --> 03:15:12.467
OLD DON'T ONE DAY OUT AND

03:15:12.534 --> 03:15:15.270
ROLLED INTO STATE SPONSORED

03:15:15.336 --> 03:15:17.005

PROGRAMS WILL BE FREE OF CHARGE

03:15:19.474 --> 03:15:21.843
IS THAT CORRECT SO THE PROGRAM

03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:23.144
THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD

03:15:23.211 --> 03:15:24.846
EXPAND THIS TO SOME OF THE

03:15:24.913 --> 03:15:26.881
LICENSED PROVIDERS- THAT

03:15:26.948 --> 03:15:29.951
CURRENTLY EXIST AND SO WE HOPE

03:15:30.018 --> 03:15:31.953
THAT THAT SOME OF THE PROVIDERS

03:15:32.020 --> 03:15:33.488
FOR CHILD CARE NOW WOULD BE

03:15:33.555 --> 03:15:35.723
INTERESTED IN CONTRACTING WITH

03:15:35.790 --> 03:15:37.425
THAT WITH THE STATE AT TO

03:15:37.492 --> 03:15:39.661
EXPAND THIS SERVICE AND SO YES-

03:15:39.727 --> 03:15:41.229
THE PRESCHOOL THE STATE

03:15:41.296 --> 03:15:43.398
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IS FREE-

03:15:43.465 --> 03:15:44.666
SUBSIDIZE AND THAT IS OUR HOPE

03:15:44.732 --> 03:15:46.234
I MEAN I THINK WE ARE WORKING

03:15:46.301 --> 03:15:48.970
TOWARDS. A MODEL OF MORE

03:15:49.037 --> 03:15:50.205
AFFORDABILITY AND CERTAINLY

03:15:50.271 --> 03:15:52.841
THIS BILL- IS FOCUSED ON THE

03:15:52.907 --> 03:15:54.542
MORE UNDERSERVED- WHO REALLY

03:15:54.609 --> 03:15:56.511
WANT TO MAKE SURE- ARE ABLE TO

03:15:56.578 --> 03:16:00.815
ACCESS. A CHILD CARE AND STATE

03:16:00.882 --> 03:16:02.784
PRESCHOOL. A NOT CREATE SO-

03:16:02.851 --> 03:16:06.221
MORE CONCERN TO ME- AT LEAST-

03:16:06.287 --> 03:16:11.292
IN MY- DISTRICT A- THE- CHILD

03:16:11.359 --> 03:16:15.296
CARE OR- CENTERS ARE NOT

03:16:15.363 --> 03:16:17.765
SUFFICIENT AND THERE'S ALWAYS A

03:16:17.832 --> 03:16:22.403
LONG. WAITING LIST AND IF YOU

03:16:22.470 --> 03:16:25.974
EXPAND- THE THAT THAT THE

03:16:26.040 --> 03:16:28.610
PROGRAM AGE GROUP TO YOUR TOOL

03:16:28.676 --> 03:16:31.579
FOR YEARS SO THAT'LL BE

03:16:31.646 --> 03:16:35.049
OVERWHELMING AND EVEN LONGER-

03:16:35.116 --> 03:16:39.888
WAITING PERIOD- TO BE ADMITTED.

03:16:39.954 --> 03:16:43.191
SO HOW CAN WE SOLVE THAT

03:16:43.258 --> 03:16:45.793
PROBLEM SO IT IS SAID THAT A

03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:47.395
COUPLE THINGS I'M NOT SURE THAT

03:16:47.462 --> 03:16:50.965
YOUR- ANALISIS EIGHT IS ONE

03:16:51.032 --> 03:16:53.134
THAT I SHARE- I IS THAT WHAT

03:16:53.201 --> 03:16:54.169
HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE A

03:16:54.235 --> 03:16:55.303
COMBINATION OF THINGS HAPPENING

03:16:55.370 --> 03:16:56.704
AND ACTUALLY IT WAS JUST SPOKEN

03:16:56.771 --> 03:16:58.373
TO WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED. THE

03:16:58.439 --> 03:17:00.241
TIKI PROGRAM RIGHT AND THAT'S

03:17:00.308 --> 03:17:01.676
HAPPENING- THROUGH BUDGET

03:17:01.743 --> 03:17:03.011
ACTIONS WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS

03:17:03.077 --> 03:17:04.812
ABOUT THAT SO ALL OF THIS WORKS

03:17:04.879 --> 03:17:08.616
TOGETHER- AND THE IDEA IS THAT.

03:17:08.683 --> 03:17:10.919
IF YOU'RE AN AGENCY IF YOU'RE A

03:17:10.985 --> 03:17:12.921
CENTER- IF YOU'RE HOME HAIR

03:17:12.987 --> 03:17:15.023
CARE PROVIDER THAT CAN EXPAND

03:17:15.089 --> 03:17:17.158
THEN YOU ARE A BIG ABLE TO GO

03:17:17.225 --> 03:17:18.860
REMEMBER THAT THE RULES CHANGE

03:17:18.927 --> 03:17:20.862
RIGHT SO FOR INFANT CARE THERE

03:17:20.929 --> 03:17:22.597
ARE CERTAIN GUIDELINES THAT ARE

03:17:22.664 --> 03:17:24.432
NEEDED FOR TODDLER CARE AND

03:17:24.499 --> 03:17:26.401
THEN FOR PRESCHOOL AND ALL OF

03:17:26.467 --> 03:17:28.102
THOSE GUIDELINES ACTUALLY AS

03:17:28.169 --> 03:17:29.137
THE STUDENTS GET OLDER THE

03:17:29.204 --> 03:17:31.039
ALLOW FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY. AND

03:17:31.105 --> 03:17:33.274
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A HIGHER-

03:17:33.341 --> 03:17:35.610
STUDENT TO ADULT RATIO AT THE

03:17:35.677 --> 03:17:38.246
OLDER AGE- AND SO ALL OF THESE

03:17:38.313 --> 03:17:39.380
THINGS ARE PART OF ANY

03:17:39.447 --> 03:17:41.149
CREATION- AND YOU WOULDN'T IF

03:17:41.216 --> 03:17:42.884
YOU WOULD NOT BE IF YOU WOULD

03:17:42.951 --> 03:17:46.221
NOT BE ABLE TO. MEET THE NEEDS

03:17:46.287 --> 03:17:47.522
OF THE CONTRACT YOU WOULD

03:17:47.589 --> 03:17:49.390
THEREFORE NOT APPLY- AS SOMEONE

03:17:49.457 --> 03:17:51.559
WHO IS HONEST SEVEN WAIT LIST

03:17:51.626 --> 03:17:53.795
THREE IN SACRAMENTO AND US FOR

03:17:53.861 --> 03:17:55.096
IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY I CAN

03:17:55.163 --> 03:17:57.432
TELL YOU- THAT THIS BILL DOES

03:17:57.498 --> 03:17:59.400
NOT MAKE THAT PROBLEM ANY

03:17:59.467 --> 03:18:01.169
BIGGER THAT PROBLEM EXISTS

03:18:01.236 --> 03:18:02.704
BECAUSE THE OVERALL THING THAT

03:18:02.770 --> 03:18:04.606
WE NEED TO DO. IS WE NEED TO

03:18:04.672 --> 03:18:06.541
INCREASE CHILD CARE SLOTS IN

03:18:06.608 --> 03:18:09.477
ALL AGES RIGHT ESPECIALLY IF

03:18:09.544 --> 03:18:11.079
THE INFANT SO IF YOU LOOK AT

03:18:11.145 --> 03:18:12.046
THE YOU KNOW NOW I MAY BE

03:18:12.113 --> 03:18:13.381
GIVING YOU TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT

03:18:13.448 --> 03:18:14.649
YOU JUST ASK THE MOTHER OF AN

03:18:14.716 --> 03:18:17.085
INFANT. ABOUT THIS SO AT THE

03:18:17.151 --> 03:18:18.453
INFANT LIST IS ACTUALLY THE

03:18:18.519 --> 03:18:20.188
LONGEST LIST IF THE SO AS THE

03:18:20.255 --> 03:18:21.923
KIDS GET OLDER AT THAT LIST IS

03:18:21.990 --> 03:18:23.625
SHORTER. SO I CA GIVE YOU MORE

03:18:23.691 --> 03:18:25.360
DETAILS IF YOU'D LIKE BUT THE

03:18:25.426 --> 03:18:28.062
THIS IS DOES NOT EX CREATE

03:18:28.129 --> 03:18:30.265
LONGER WAIT LIST THIS ACTUALLY

03:18:30.331 --> 03:18:31.899
EXPANDS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:18:31.966 --> 03:18:33.835
SERVE MORE KIDS THROUGH THE

BEFORE THE BABY WAS EVEN OUT

OUT OF HER APARTMENT BECAUSE

03:31:56.837 --> 03:31:57.271
SHE DIDN'T WANT IT IS AN

03:31:57.337 --> 03:31:59.006

BLACK MOTHERS. CALIFORNIA CAN

03:32:18.325 --> 03:32:19.626

CHILDREN HAVE A FAIR CHANCE TO

03:32:21.261 --> 03:32:22.996
BE BORN HEALTHY. AND REACH

03:32:23.063 --> 03:32:24.565
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. IN

03:32:24.631 --> 03:32:26.366
CALIFORNIA TODAY HOWEVER TOO

03:32:26.433 --> 03:32:28.335
MANY PREGNANT PEOPLE. ARE SHUT

03:32:28.402 --> 03:32:29.470
OUT OF THE RESOURCES AND

03:32:29.536 --> 03:32:31.071
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY NEED TO

03:32:31.138 --> 03:32:32.739
HAVE A HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND

03:32:32.806 --> 03:32:35.609
BIRTH. RESOURCES LIKE HOUSING.

03:32:35.676 --> 03:32:37.544
RESPECTFUL HEALTHCARE. NURSING

WAGES. WHICH WE KNOW ARE

03:32:41.381 --> 03:32:44.118
ESSENTIAL- THE CONSEQUENCES OF

03:32:44.184 --> 03:32:46.019
NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THESE

03:32:46.086 --> 03:32:46.753
RESOURCES ARE DEVASTATING FOR

03:32:46.820 --> 03:32:50.190
ALL OF US. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA.

03:32:50.257 --> 03:32:51.492
ONE IN EIGHT BLACK BABIES IS

03:32:51.558 --> 03:32:53.794
BORN PREMATURE. A RATED PRE

03:32:53.861 --> 03:32:55.095
MATURITY THAT'S WORSE THAN MANY

03:32:55.162 --> 03:32:57.564
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AND IT'S

03:32:57.631 --> 03:32:59.867
43% HOWELL IN OTHER GROUPS IN

03:32:59.933 --> 03:33:01.902
CALIFORNIA. NATIVE AMERICAN

03:33:01.969 --> 03:33:03.137
PEOPLE HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST

03:33:03.203 --> 03:33:04.805
RATE OF PRETERM BIRTH. AND

03:33:04.872 --> 03:33:06.140
UNFORTUNATELY THE GROUPS ARE

03:33:06.206 --> 03:33:07.708
ALSO FACED WITH THE BURDEN OF

03:33:07.774 --> 03:33:11.545
HIGHER RATES OF MATERNAL

03:33:11.612 --> 03:33:12.446
MORTALITY AND INFANT MORTALITY.

03:33:12.513 --> 03:33:13.247
SO IT'S PREMATURE WHEN THEY'RE

03:33:13.313 --> 03:33:14.314
BORN IN JUST A FEW WEEKS

03:33:14.381 --> 03:33:16.316
PREMATURE THE IMPACT CAN LAST A

03:33:16.383 --> 03:33:18.285
LIFETIME. BABIES THAT ARE BORN

03:33:18.352 --> 03:33:19.987

HEALTH AND COGNITIVE PROBLEMS

03:33:21.722 --> 03:33:24.324
THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE. ALSO

03:33:24.391 --> 03:33:25.492
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE THOUGHT.

03:33:25.559 --> 03:33:27.528

03:59:04.797 --> 03:59:07.499
US FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW. THE

03:59:07.566 --> 03:59:09.435
PART THAT BECAME THE BIGGEST

03:59:09.501 --> 03:59:11.503
BARRIER WASN'T HOW I'M LIVING

03:59:11.570 --> 03:59:14.807
TODAY. BUT DRUG CONVICTIONS

03:59:14.873 --> 03:59:16.308
FROM THIRTY YEARS AGO BUT I

03:59:16.375 --> 03:59:20.145
CANNOT AND DO. AND THIS IS AN

03:59:20.212 --> 03:59:21.447
ISSUE THAT'S SPECIFIC TO ME.

03:59:21.513 --> 03:59:23.282
THURMOND STARTING OVER I WORK

03:59:23.348 --> 03:59:25.651
WITH AND INTERACT WITH MOTHERS

03:59:25.718 --> 03:59:27.352
EVERY DAY WHO FACE THESE

03:59:27.419 --> 03:59:29.588
BARRIERS MANY OF HOME FIND

03:59:29.655 --> 03:59:30.823
THESE BARRIERS TO BE

03:59:30.889 --> 03:59:33.425
INSURMOUNTABLE. AND SO

03:59:33.492 --> 03:59:35.561
UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR FIRST

03:59:35.627 --> 03:59:38.497
PRIORITY IS THE CHILDREN I

03:59:38.564 --> 03:59:40.499
BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE CHILDREN

03:59:40.566 --> 03:59:42.534
THE CHILDREN WHO ARE GOING INTO

03:59:42.601 --> 03:59:44.536
THE HILD WELFARE SYSTEM

03:59:44.603 --> 03:59:48.273
DESERVE THE BENEFITS OF AN

03:59:48.340 --> 03:59:49.541
INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT. AND

03:59:49.608 --> 03:59:52.010
IT COMES TO RELATIVES OR NON

03:59:52.077 --> 03:59:54.046
RELATIVES IN THE FAMILY MEMBERS

03:59:54.113 --> 03:59:55.881
THAT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH

03:59:55.948 --> 03:59:59.384
THE CHILD AND SO IN A BROAD

03:59:59.451 --> 04:00:01.820
BLANKET. YOU'RE LIKE YOU KNOW

04:00:01.887 --> 04:00:04.056
YOU HAVE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS

04:00:04.123 --> 04:00:05.924
THAT RESTRICT YOU FROM EVER.

04:00:05.991 --> 04:00:08.227
BRINGING CHILDREN OUT OF THE

04:00:08.293 --> 04:00:10.696
CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. ISN'T

04:00:10.763 --> 04:00:11.630
THAT A GOOD OUTCOME THAT WE

04:00:11.697 --> 04:00:14.166
WANT AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL

04:00:14.233 --> 04:00:15.334
WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE

04:00:15.400 --> 04:00:17.202
CHILDREN BUT I BELIEVE THAT

04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:18.904
THIS PARTICULAR BARRIER IS

04:00:18.971 --> 04:00:21.039
CREATING MORE HARM BECAUSE

04:00:21.106 --> 04:00:22.407
WE'RE BASING THE OUTCOME OF

04:00:22.474 --> 04:00:24.743
CHILD PLACEMENT. ON THE

04:00:24.810 --> 04:00:26.779
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT

04:00:26.845 --> 04:00:29.314
THE DATA SHOWN HAVE THAT THIS

04:00:29.381 --> 04:00:31.416
DISPARITY IMPACT UPON BLACK AND

04:00:31.483 --> 04:00:33.185
BROWN PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY

04:00:33.252 --> 04:00:35.287
AND THEREFORE BELCHING BLACK

04:00:35.354 --> 04:00:37.289
AND BROWN CHILDREN ARE AT A

04:00:37.356 --> 04:00:38.924
DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO

04:00:38.991 --> 04:00:40.058
BEING PLACED WITH FAMILY

04:00:40.125 --> 04:00:42.294
MEMBERS BECAUSE WE'RE RELYING.

04:00:42.361 --> 04:00:44.596
ON CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS TO THE

04:00:44.663 --> 04:00:46.231
POINT THAT WE FOREGO EVERYTHING

04:00:46.298 --> 04:00:49.268
ELSE. SO NOW I'M ABLE TO READ

04:00:49.334 --> 04:00:51.036
