AS PART OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY UNDER PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON. THE NEAREST RELIEF ORGANIZATION WAS FOUNDED IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND RESCUE WE ARMENIANS GREEKS ASSYRIANS. IN OTHER CHRISTIAN MINORITIES FROM ANNIHILATION IN MINOR ASIA. DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING PROOF OF GENOCIDAL INTENT THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY ADAMANTLY DENIED THE OCCURRENCE OF THE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY COMMITTED BY THE AUTUMN IN AND YOUNG TURK RULERS. AND CONTINUES TO DO SO OVER A FULL CENTURY SINCE THE CRIMES OCCURRED. CALIFORNIA AS WE ALL KNOW IS HOME TO THE LARGEST ARMENIAN AMERICAN POPULATION UNITED STATES AND ARMENIANS LIVING CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN REACHED OUR STATE THROUGH THEIR LEADERSHIP. AND CONTRIBUTIONS IN BUSINESS AGRICULTURE ACADEMIA GOVERNMENT AND THE ARTS. MANY OF WHOM HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO EXPERIENCE FIRSTHAND THE HORRORS OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IN ITS ONGOING DENIAL. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THE CITY CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD REMAIN RESULT IN THEIR SPIRIT CONTINUES TO THRIVE MORE THAN A CENTURY AFTER THEIR NEAR ANNIHILATION. ON A VERY PERSONAL LEVEL. THE STORY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE TRULY HITS HOME. IN ADDITION TO THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ARMENIANS APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION GREEKS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ASSYRIANS WERE SLAUGHTERED IN THE FIRST GENOCIDE. OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN TWENTY TWO A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL NAMED KAI AND ALONG WITH HER FAMILY. FLIGHT FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE OF MUNTASIR TO THE PORT CITY OF ZMIR NOW.

BY EITHER THE FIRE FOR THE TURKS. WITHOUT PAPERS WITHOUT MONEY AND WITHOUT RESOURCES. THEY MADE GREASE THEIR HOME BEFORE COMING TO AMERICA IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. THIS STORY OF TRAGEDY IN SURVIVAL IS SHARED THROUGHOUT THE ARMENIAN GREEK AN ASSYRIAN COMMUNITIES. A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. MY WIFE ANA AND I TRAVEL BACK TO SMYRNA.

AT THE VERY HARBOR WHERE SHE FLED FOR SURVIVAL. LOOKING BACK AT THE TRIP I CANNOT HELP BUT RECALL THE WORDS OF FRESNO WRITER WILLIAM SAROYAN. WHO WROTE? I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY POWER OF THE WORLD DESTROY THIS RACE. THEN SEE IF THEY WILL NOT LAUGH. SING AND PRAY AGAIN. FOR WHEN TWO OF THEM MEET ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. SEE IF THEY WILL NOT CREATE. A NEW ARMENIA. THE FACT THAT THEY WERE THERE SPEAKING TO CHI INTO. THAT WE WERE THERE SPEAKING THAT HIGH IN IT PROVES. THE TURKS INDEED FAILED. THE ARMENIANS WILL NOT BE STRICKEN FROM THIS EARTH AB. AS OUR THIRTY ONE WILL DESIGNATE APRIL AS THE MONTH OF COMMEMORATION OF THE HUNDRED FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. AND URGED THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS TO HAVE HE COURAGE TO FALLING DECLARE WHAT OCCURRED FROM NINETEEN FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY THREE AS WHAT IT WAS. GENOCIDE.

SEEING AND HEARING NONE EYES THIRTY EIGHT KNOWS ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES FILE ITEM SEVENTEEN SENATOR MITCHELL MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL ONE EIGHTY EIGHT BY SENATOR MITCHELL AN ACT RELATING TO DISCRIMINATION. SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M PRESIDING SB ONE EIGHT EIGHT THE CROWN ACT. TOO THOUGH GOLD ACT TO CREATE A RESPECTFUL AN OPEN WORKPLACE FOR NATURAL HAIR. COLLEAGUES THE PURPOSE OF INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND BRINGING IT BEFORE YOU TODAY IS REALLY TWO FOLD. FIRST TO HELP DISPEL MYTHS AND EDUCATE THOSE OF YOU WHO NEED IT. ABOUT THE UNIQUE QUALITIES OF BLACK HAIR ITS TEXTURE IN THE BLACK HERE EXPERIENCE. SECONDLY IF THE CHALLENGE COMMON HELD MYTHS ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES PROFESSIONALISM IN THE WORKPLACE. UNTIL VERY RECENTLY. A GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH FOR COLD UNPROFESSIONAL HERE STYLES YIELDED ONLY PICTURES OF BLACK WOMEN WITH THEIR NATURAL HAIR OR RATE OR WEARING BRAIDS ARE TWO S.. ALTHOUGH THIS HEARTENING THIS FACT WAS NOT VERY SURPRISING. EURO CENTRIC STANDARDS OF BEAUTY HAVE ESTABLISHED THE VERY UNDERPINNINGS OF WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE AND ATTRACTIVE IN THE MEDIA. IN ACADEMIC SETTINGS AND IN THE WORKPLACE. AND SO EVEN THOUGH AFTER AMERICANS WERE NO LONGER EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM THE WORKPLACE. BLACK FEATURES AND MANNERISMS REMAINED UNACCEPTABLE AND QUOTE ON PROFESSIONAL. UNTIL RECENT DECADES BLACK MEN AND WOMEN DIDN'T OFTEN CHALLENGED THE STANDARDS THEY DON THEIR WINGS OR STRAIGHTEN THEIR HAIR WITH HARSH CHEMICAL RELAXERS. TO MEET THOSE EURO CENTRIC STANDARDS. MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO. REMINDED ME ABOUT THE CALL. A A CHEMICAL PROCESS THAT MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN WAR IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. IT WAS A HAIR STYLE WAS THAT WAS ARGUE WITH DANGEROUS AND FRANKLY NOT EVEN PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE. FOR CENTURIES THE BLACK PEOPLE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CONFORM TO HARSH AND EXPENSE OF STANDARDS THE CHANGE IN THEIR NATURAL APPEARANCE. SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE OF THE PASS. THE WERE BEYOND SUCH OUT RIGHT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON APPEARANCE. AND SOME QUITE FRANKLY AREN'T QUITE SURE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE AT ALL. FEDERAL AND STATE LAW DO PROTECT FROM DISK INDIVIDUALS FROM DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RELIGIOUS HAIR STYLES AND HEAD COVERINGS. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL FAR TOO MANY CASES OF BLACK EMPLOYEES AND APPLICANTS DENIED EMPLOYMENT OR PROMOTION. EVEN TERMINATED BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY CHOOSE TO WEAR THEIR HAIR. I HAVE HEARD FAR TOO MANY REPORTS OF BLACK CHILDREN HUMILIATEDAND SENT HOME FROM SCHOOL BECAUSE THEIR NATURAL HAIR WAS DEEMED UNRULY OR A DISTRACTION TO OTHERS. CAN WE TRULY SAY THAT EQUITY EXISTS WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO LEARNING CLASS BECAUSE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR HAIR. WHERE IS THE JUSTICE LA BLACK MEN AND WOMEN ARE DENIED ACCESS TO ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT? BECAUSE OF THEIR NATURAL APPEARANCE. BRAIDS TWISTS AND LOCKS ALSO BE MOM I PROTECTED RIGHT TO CHOOSE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAIRSTYLES LIKE MINE CRIED QUITE FRANKLY WHICH WOULD WITHOUT QUESTION. IN AN IMAGE OF PROFESSIONALISM pWERE NOT INVOLVED. THE SUPPOSE IT RACE NEUTRAL WORKPLACE BREWING POLICIES THAT DAN BRAIDS TWISTS CORN ROWS ARE LOCKS MAY APPLY TO EMPLOYEES OR APPLICANTS OF ALL RACES. HOWEVER THEY HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON BLACK MEN AND WOMEN. THIS MEANS THAT THESE POLICIES ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO EXCLUDE BLACK PEOPLE FROM THE WORKPLACE THAN PEOPLE OF ANY OTHER RACE. THERE ARE THOSE WHO IN OPPOSITION WHO BELIEVE THAT THE BILL WILL RESULT IN FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS THAT WILL BURDEN EMPLOYERS. OR THAT THE BILL WILL PREVENT EMPLOYERS FROM REQUIRING THE WEARING OF HERE NOW SIR OTHER PROTECTIVE HERE COVERING. COLLEAGUES THAT IS NOT THE TRUTH. HOWEVER BY CLEAR FIND IT HERE TEXTURING HAIRSTYLES ARE TIED TO RACIAL IDENTITY. THIS BILL ACTUALLY HELPS MAKE EMPLOYERS AWARE OF TRAITS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED. AND HELP THEM CREATE GROOMING POLICIES THAT WILL FOSTER INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY. SB ONE EIGHTY EIGHT PROTECT BLACK EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS FROM BEING FORCED TO CONFORM TO NON IN CLOSE TO A NON INCLUSIVE IDEA OF A PROFESSIONAL IMAGE AT THE EXPENSE. OF THEIR PERSONAL CHOICE. WITH THAT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING THEM MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CLOSE. CERTAINLY. I APPRECIATE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD I JUST WANTED TO ADD A POINT THAT WE AS A BODY CONSISTENTLY SHOW CAPACITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. THE UNDERSTAND THAT EMPATHIZE WITH THOSE WHO AREN'T LIKE THIS. WHO COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS ETHNICITIES CULTURE OR RELIGION? I BELIEVE THAT ANY LAW POLICY OR PRACTICE THAT SANCTIONS THE JOB DESCRIPTION THAT IMMEDIATELY EXCLUDES ME FROM A POSITION. NOT BECAUSE OF MY CAPACITY OR MY CAPABILITIES OR MY EXPERIENCE BUT BECAUSE OF MY HAIR STYLE CHOICE IS LONG OVERDUE FOR REFORM. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE OF THIS BE.
