THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY. I AM A BI FOR TWENTY EIGHT EIGHT BEFORE TWENTY EIGHT IS RATHER SIMPLE AND STRIKES AT THE CORE OF OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS WE MUST ENSURE. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT LEAST THE BEST ELECTED REPRESENTATION POSSIBLE. THIS BILL GUARANTEES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COUNTY SUPERVISORS BY ALLOWING THEM TO STAND FOR REELECTION AND GAIN EXPERTISE OF THE JOB THROUGH A MINIMUM. OF TWO ELECTED TERMS IN OFFICE. WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM ADEQUATE COMPENSATION IS LAID OUT IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SO WE HAVE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. THAT ARE NOT JUST INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY. BUT THE WITH THE WATERS SURROUND THIS BILL HAVE BEEN MUDDIED. INCLUDING A IN A FUNDAMENTALLY FUNDAMENTALLY INCORRECT LETTER SUBMITTED BY THE OPPOSITION. JERRY BERMAN IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT PLEASE AB FOUR TWENTY EIGHT. DOES NOT CONTAIN IT RETROACTIVE CLAUSE. NOR WILL I ALLOW ONE TO BE AMENDED INTO THE BILL THEREFORE THIS BILL DOES NOT DIRECTLY OVERTURN ANY LOCAL MEASURE NOR IS IT SUPPOSED TO. HOWEVER THERE WAS A RECENT LOCAL MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTED A DEFICIENCY IN STATE LAW. THAT WE MUST ADDRESS RESULTING IN THIS BILL BEFORE THAT BEFORE ALL OF US TODAY. THIS BILL CONTAINS. ONE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE WOULD SET THE FLOOR OF A MINIMUM OF TWO TERMS FOR COUNTY SUPERVISORS IN COUNTY ORDINANCES OR INITIATIVES. AND ONE TECHNICAL CHANGE CLARIFYING THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS ARE THEMSELVES OFFICERS AS REFLECTED ARTICLE LEVIN. SECTION ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. AS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE CONSTITUTION EXPLICITLY% PROVIDES THE COMPENSATION COUNTY OFFICERS. INCLUDING THE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNINGBODY ELECTED COUNTY SHERIFF ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY ELECTED ASSESSOR. AND ANY OTHER OFFICES CREATED BY THE BOARD SHALL BE PRESCRIBED ORDINANCE AND THE NEW ORLEANS PRESCRIBING SUCH COMPENSATION. SHALL BE SUBJECT TO REFERENDUM. I AM JOINED TODAY BY THE HER SOME OF THE- URBAN COUNTIES ACCOUNT. AS WELL THE SECTOR DAY. ABOUT THE JOINED BY TWO BRENNAN THE BEHALF OF S. THANK YOU SURE. THANK YOU MISTER MAY- AND WE WILL MOVE TO- G. HEARST FROM THE URBAN COUNTIES ACCOUNT JUST OVER MY OF TWO. AND I BELIEVE YOUR THING YOU. PERFECT BY PHONE.

OUT WHICH WOULD ENSURE THAT ON APPROACH BE THAT CALIFORNIA COUNTY BOARD OF DEEPER BUT ARE SUBJECT TO A TERM LIMIT WHETHER BAKER CHARTER OR BRIGHT ARE ELIGIBLE A MINUTE A FEW. AND CLEAR I THINK THE THING LAW THAT THE OF SUPERVISORS ON THE FOR WRITING CONTENT COMPENSATE FOR ALL COUNTY OFF IN THE BOY THEMSELVES. WE TRY SUPPORT THIS CHANGE IN FACT. TO ENSURE AN APPROPRIATE LESS OF. THE OFFICE ACCOUNT TO PROVIDE. A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND ACCOUNTED. ARE AND THE COURT. ABOUT THAT CAN HELLO CAN BE- CAN YOU TO PROVIDERS AND CAL. THAT MAKES AND ALSO UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR APPROPRIATE TIME TO ALLOW THE PROVIDER TO GAIN EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING WHAT IS AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX THAT OF SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. A SINGLE TURN SIMPLY DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH EXPERTISE. AND AS A RESULT OUR MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT A SINGLE TERM LIMIT WOULD MEAN FOR COUNTY POLICY MAKING AND SERVICE PROVISION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. CHINESE TO PROVIDE THEIR TAKE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY AND ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TIME REQUIRED TO DEVELOP EXPERTISE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE WIDER RANGE. OF THE BALL. AS A RESULT WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY EIGHT TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS HURST AND NEXT UP I BELIEVE WE HAVE TERRY BRENNAN FROM SEIU- MY NOTES SAY THAT TERRY'S IN.

VERY GOOD. AB BOARD TWENTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY ANOTHER SKIRMISH IN A LOCAL POLITICAL BATTLE. THIS CONFLICT HAS RAGED IN SAMBAR DINO COUNTY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. RICHARD MELL THE POLITICAL ELITE OF THE COUNTY PROPOSED A ONE SIZE FITS ALL LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REFORM MEASURE SPONSORED BY RED DESPERATE IT WAS APPROVED BY 64% OF THE VOTERS. HOWEVER THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT PRESENTED THEIR COMPETING MANAGER. THAT PASSED BY 67% IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OUR ORGAN. HAVE FOR SEPARATE GOOD FOR AND- THE POLITICAL. SUED US ON TWELVE WE'RE SO FIGHTING THIS COURT WHAT MAJOR DID IT THROUGH THE NOVEMBER TWO VOTE AND DINO COUNTY APPROVED MAJOR BY MORE THAN TWO TO VOTE. MAJOR CASE OF SUPER SALARY ON WITH THE NEW HOW FOR IN IN THIS. POOR COUNTY. IT ALSO SET ONE FOUR YEAR TERM OF SERVICE TO AN ELECTED OFFICIAL COULD FOCUS ON GOVERNING. MANEUVERING FOR REELECTION. RATHER THAN ACCEPT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AGREE FASHION DUTIES ACCORDING TO VOTER INTO. DECEMBER COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WENT TO BATTLE AGAINST THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS. INSERTING BREATHTAKING AUDACITY THE BOARD USE TAXPAYER FUNDING AND TO HOLD IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INITIATIVE THAT WAS JUST APPROVED BY THOSE VERY SAME TAXPAYERS. AB FOUR TO EIGHT IS NOTHING BUT SOUR GRAPES FROM THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT DECEMBER DINO KALE. IN ORDER TO OF REFORM THEY PROPOSED TO IMPOSE THEIR LOCAL SOLUTION ON THE ENTIRE STATE. EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY SHOULD BE ROUNDLY REJECTED. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MURPHY AND WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MISTER KAUFMAN. THANK YOU. TIMBRE DEALS MEASURE K&lt;c.cyan&gt; TWO THINGS&lt;/c&gt; IT AMENDED THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY CHARTER TO SET TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR EACH MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO FIVE THOUSAND PER MONTH. UNLIMITED MEMBERS TO A ONE FOUR YEAR TERM TURN. AB FOUR TO EIGHT THOSE TWO THINGS IMPOSE A LIMIT OF NO FEWER THAN TWO TERMS AND SPECIFY THE BORE SUPERVISORS AND IS INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF COUNTY OFFICERS. FOR WHOM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IS REQUIRED TO PRESCRIBE COMPENSATION. THE INTENT OF AB FOUR TO EIGHT IT'S CLEAR NO MORE MEASURE CASE THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL BELIEVE MEDICAID A PROBLEM. BUT IT'S NO WORSE THAN STRIPPING VOTER STATEWIDE OF THE ABILITY TO DESIGNATE THEIR PREFERRED LENGTH OF TERMS AND SET PAY OF THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE THE OUTCOME OF AN ELECTION. ARTICLE TWO SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONSTITUTION SAYS ALL POLITICAL POWER IS INHERENT IN THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ALTER OR REFORM IT WHEN THE PUBLIC GOOD MAY REQUIRE. THE PEOPLE OF SAMBAR DINO COUNTY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO INITIATIVE AND ALTER THE COUNTY CHARTER. AB FOUR TO EIGHT ATTEMPTS TO SUBVERT THIS BOOK REFORM EFFORTS SANCTIONED BY THE STATE CONTROLLING LEGAL DOCUMENT BY ALTERING THE CODE IN A WAY THAT PREVENTS BOATERS AND ANY OTHER COUNTY FROM DOING THE SAME IF MEASURE K. THIS IS NOT THE PROPER RESPONSE TO A LAWFUL VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. WE ALSO REMAIN UNCONVINCED THAT AB FOUR TO EIGHT WOULD NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION BETTER CANE TEMPER AND DINO AND WE HAVE TO VOTE NO. ON AB FOUR TO EIGHT THANK YOU.

LET'S ALSO QUICKLY GO TO THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY REMOTE TESTIMONY FOR THIS BILL. LOOKING AT A BLANK BLACK SCREEN I'M GOING TO ASSUME THERE'S NO REMOTE TESTIMONY FOR THE BILL- SO WITH THAT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COLLEAGUES. FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON A BEFORE TWENTY EIGHT. LOOKING FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS MOTION SECONDS MISTER ROYSTER. PLEASE YEAH THIS IS THIS HOW DIFFICULT BILL FOR ME BECAUSE IT HAS THERE'S TWO PRINCIPLES INVOLVED HERE. ONE OF THEM IS THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. AND IN IN THE OTHER ONE IS MY CONCERN FOR FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT. AND YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE YEARS I'VE SEEN LOTS OF WILL OF THE VOTER VOTES THAT ARE IMPOSED ON CITIES AND COUNTIES AND LOCALITIES. DETER DETER DAMAGING. TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY THEY GET. BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CHOSE AND TRYING TO GO OVER THE WILL OF THE VOTERS IS A DIFFICULT THING- FOR THIS I REALLY FEEL LIKE- THE I I'M I'M SUPER ON THE FENCE BECAUSE- AT THE. TRYING TO A LIKE I SAID TRYING TO. GO AGAINST THE WILL OF THE VOTERS CREATES THIS DISSENSION IN IN A COMMUNITY OR IN IT I THINK AND I THINK THIS IS MORE OF A- GOVERNMENT BY GOVERNMENT THING NOT A STATE WIDE THING THAT SHOULD BE IMPOSED ON EVERYBODY- IF. YOU WANT COUNTY WANTS TO RUIN THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THEY CITIES I MEAN THEY CAN PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT THEY VOTE FOR. THE GUY CARE ACT TO LIVE WITH IT. IN IN WITHIN ONE. POINT OF VIEW. YEAH AND THEN YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY FIGURE OUT THAT WHILE. EVERYBODY'S PASSING US BY. N. N. AND THEN MAYBE THEY GET OLD YOU KNOW THEY DO SOMETHING TO FIX THAT. ARE IN THERE IS ALSO THE COURT WAY OF DOING IF THERE'S TOO MUCH DAMAGE IT'S GOING TO BE DONE AND I KNOW ONE CASE THAT. THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THE CITY LANDED ONCE. WE'RE NOT DOING THAT BECAUSE THIS IS JUST GOING TO. CREATE TOO MUCH DAMAGE. SO- YOU KNOW I'M I'M- PROBABLY GONNA LAY OFF YOUR BILL TODAY- AND- WE CAN- FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR. THANKS WHAT IF I CAN'T- YEAH MISTER TERRITORY ACTUALLY WHAT YOU JUST REFERENCE I STRUGGLE WITH THOSE VERY SAME THINGS AND BY THE WAY- YOU AND I AREN'T THE FIRST TO STRUGGLE WITH THIS IF YOU GO BACK. TO THE BEGINNING OF OUR THAT THE FOUNDATION OF OUR OF OUR OF OUR GOVERNMENT THESE ARE THE DEBATES THAT OUR FOUNDERS HAD IN REGARDS TO HOW HOW MANY YEARS. UNITED STATES SENATORS- SHOULD HAVE VERSUS HOW MANY YEARS THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAVE HOW MUCH- INFLUENCE WE HAVE- DIRECTLY FROM THE PEOPLE AND HOW MUCH SHOULD THERE BE THAT THE INSTITUTIONS. AS YOU AS YOU KNOW- OUR INSTITUTIONS- OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS HAVE. BEEN UNDER DIRECT ASSAULT FROM THE BY ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT GROUPS- AND THAT THESE DEBATES ABOUT- A BIG GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE AND ALSO HAVING A CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC- IS A IS SOMETHING REAL- YOU HER OUT WHERE I COME DOWN ON THIS- AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THIS BECAUSE YOU SERVED IN LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I THINK ALMOST EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE- SERVED IN. IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HANFORD WHEN I SUCH FOUR YEARS OLD DELAY WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE AND- ALTHOUGH I HAD GOTTEN A DEGREE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND GOVERNMENT. AND THOUGHT I HAD ALL THE ANSWERS- I REALIZE VERY QUICKLY- THAT- I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT- AND I REMEMBER I WOULD GET THE AGENDA PACKETS. FOR CITY COUNCIL AND I'D GET THEM WE HAD TUESDAY NIGHT MEETINGS I'D GET HIM. I USUALLY THURSDAY OR FRIDAY AND I SPENT ALL WEEKEND READING EVERY SINGLE WORD OF THAT AGENDA PACKET. INTEL THE I'D GET TO THE COUNCIL AND I REALIZED THAT IT TOOK ME A GOOD THREE YEARS. ON THAT COUNCIL TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE DECISIONS THAT I WAS MAKING IT PROBABLY TOOK FIVE YEARS. BEFORE I REALLY SORT OF GRASS THAT THE DECISION THAT I MADE OF THE IMPACT THEY HAVE I THINK ALL OF YOU PROBABLY HAD. A THAT THAT THAT SPRINT'S IF YOU'RE HONEST WITH WITH YOURSELVES. A YUCCA VALLEY THIS IS THE CITY THAT I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER I HAD FIFTY EMPLOYEES- IS A POPULATION OF TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. IT WAS A CONTRACT- CONTRACT CITY THAT CONTRACTED OUT FOR FIRE. AND POLICE AND IT TOOK ME THREE YEARS- AND WE REALLY FIVE YEARS TO REALLY FULLY UNDERSTAND THE DECISIONS I WAS MAKING. THE TWO COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT BOTH REPRESENT MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE. ON ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT BUT THAT WE- WE BOTH THOUGHT WE BOTH SERVE- THAT BUDGETS THAT ARE IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ARE THEY HAVE EMPLOYEES NORTH OF TWENTY THOUSAND. THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THOSE THE BORDER DIRECTORS HAVE. IS SIGNIFICANT AND TO THINK TO THINK. THAT YOU CAN ONLY SERVE- THAT THE AVERAGE. TIME FOR THAT FIVE MEMBER BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS EITHER ONE AND A HALF YEARS. OR TWO AND A HALF YEARS. I FIND IT TO BE- DISASTROUS. AND SO THE THING BEFORE US TODAY. IN GOING PERSPECTIVE ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WITH ABUNDANTLY CLEAR BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION I THINK KEEPS REFERENCING. ONE PARTICULAR ONE PARTICULAR COUNTY THIS ABOUT GOING GOING FORWARD IT'S NOT TURNING BACK THE WILL. OF THE PEOPLE I WOULDN'T. I WOULDN'T SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THIS IS ABOUT. GOING FORWARD AND SAYING LISTEN- A FOR. FOUR THESE POWERFUL POSITIONS BEING THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AT LEAST AT LEAST TWO TERMS SO. YEAH ONE. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MAYES GOT A MOTION IN THE BACK GOT A SECOND GOT A BUNCH OF COMMENTS AND JUST WANNA REMIND EVERYBODY GOT A PACKED AGENDA AND A LOT OF TIME MISTER BENNETT PLEASE GREATER CERTAINLY TRY TO RESPECT THAT THE REQUESTED TIME I REALLY APPRECIATE DAY HEARING- THAT MY COLLEAGUE IS- STILL ON THE FENCE- IN AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION TO THOSE OUT THERE IN TERMS OF OVERTURNING OF OVER THE PEOPLE THIS IS HAVING THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC IS IMPORTANT. BUT I WOULD HAVE OF THE JUST LIKE THE OFFER THIS AS YOUR ON THE FENCE- ON THIS ISSUE AND THAT IS THAT FUNDAMENTALLY WE'RE HERE TO DO GOOD GOVERNMENT AND TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOOD GOVERNMENT AND THEN DO IT AND OFTENTIMES ONE OF THE FACTORS IS MAINTAINING THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE AS WE DO THAT BUT THERE. BUT ULTIMATELY IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IN A CLOSE CALL AND YOU GO THIS IS GOOD GOVERNMENT BUT THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR THIS WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY HEY IF THEY WANT TO RUIN THEIR COUNTY GO AHEAD I SIT THERE AND TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE HEARD WHILE THEY RUIN THEIR COUNTY THEY DIDN'T HAVE A VOICE THAT FOSTER KID THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANYBODY SHOW UP- WHEN. WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE COUNTY. GIVE WASN'T MANAGE PROPER EXCEPT FOR SELF. WHEN I'M FACED WITH THIS TENSION IT'S ALWAYS YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE GOOD GOVERNMENT THE SECOND THING I POINT OUT TO YOU AS- NEW. WE NEVER GIVE THE PUBLIC THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON EVERYTHING. SO WHAT IF THEY SAID YOU KNOW WE ONE OF THE ONLY HAVE ONE YEAR IN OFFICE. WELL THE FOOD WAS SAFELY WILL WANT TO HAVE SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE WE WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO DO SOMETHING SO. WHAT WE DO AT THE STATE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL HERE WITH REGARDS ELECTIONS IS SET THIS THE MINIMUM STANDARDS. AND I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THE MINIMUM STANDARD BE MORE THAN ONE TERM. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE JOBS HERE. AND SO WHAT IF SO T'S NOT LIKE WE'RE- IT MORE NOT OVERTURNING THE VOTERS. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT RETROACTIVE OF THE AUTHOR IS BEING VERY VERY WISE ABOUT THAT IS NOT. WHERE WE'RE JUST TELLING THE VOTERS IN THE FUTURE THIS IS THE PLAYING FIELD YOU GET TO VOTE. ANYTHING YOU WANT IT HERE. BUT IT THESE ARE THE MINIMUMS RIGHT THAT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T GO BEYOND. AND WITH THAT I WOULD JUST SAY. THAT I SUPPORT THE BILL- SECONDING IT- DOUBLE SECOND GET. WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUES BUT- I WOULD ACTUALLY I WANT THE ALSO YOU KNOW I'VE ACTUALLY FEEL EVEN BETTER ABOUT THE BILL IF IT WAS THREE TERMS. BECAUSE I THINK TWELVE YEARS IS WHAT THE STATE LEGISLATURES IMPOSED ON ITSELF. OUR HAS IMPOSED ON THAT I'VE ACTUALLY SERVE IN A COUNTY THAT HAS A TWELVE YEAR LIMIT. AND TWELVE YEARS IS LONG ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN A SUPERVISORS IMMEDIATELY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR NEXT STEP IS. AND I THINK WHEN YOU GO BELOW THAT YOU HAVE THAT AS A PROBLEM SO. IF AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD YOU- WANTED TO- AMENDED TO TWELVE YEARS I CERTAINLY WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. BUT I'M ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EFFORT IF THAT'S WHAT IF THAT'S IF THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO GET THROUGH. BECAUSE IT'S FAR BETTER THAN WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY COULD TAKE IT DOWN TO ONE. THING AGAIN IF THANK YOU. WILL MISSOURI. I THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MAYES- BRINGING THIS AND YOU KNOW I AM HUGE OF TERM LIMITS- BUT WITH THE REASON- I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE IF. IF IT WERE NOT FOR TERM LIMITS BUT PRIOR TO MY COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE THERE WAS A SIX YEAR TERM LIMIT TO. THE ASSEMBLY AND THE WAY I DESCRIBE IT WAS THE FIRST TWO YEARS YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE BATHROOM IS THE SECOND TWO YEARS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING ABOUT THE LAST TWO YEARS FOLKS WERE ALREADY BUSY TRYING TO RUN FOR SOMETHING ELSE. AND SO WAS THAT THE SERVICE FOR THE STATE TO ONLY HAVE TWO GOOD YEARS OUT OF A MEMBER NOW THAT WE HAVE TWELVE YEARS. WE FIGURED OUT WHERE THE BATHROOM IS THAT NOW YOU HAVE A SOLID AMOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE I THINK WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE STATE AND I THINK IT'S HAPPENING AND ACTUAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE NOT RUNNING THE STATE I AM THE ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE NOT RUNNING THE CITY SAID STAFF THAT'S RUNNING THE CITIES. AND SO WE GET INTO A SITUATION WHERE WHERE IT DOESN'T MATTER- IF YOU VOTED ME AND IF I'M NOT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTINGPOLICIES THAT ARE GOING TO HELP. AND SO% FOR ME I YOU KNOW AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT. A SOLID EIGHT YEARS WHERE FOLKS ARE GOING TO GET EXACTLY YOU KNOW GOOD OR BAD- A REPRESENTATIVE THAT THAT HAS THAT INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND AT LEAST HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE TO MOVE FORWARD SO THANK YOU FOR THE MEASURE. YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE MS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT TWELVE YEARS WOULD BE IDEAL. BUT IF EIGHT YEARS AS SOMETHING THAT THAT- YOU KNOW IS ONLY. GOING TO GET THIS THROUGH. YEARS IS A PLENTY AGAIN INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE MATTERS. BUT BUT THE WORK AND THE- THE EDUCATION THAT WE GET. IN THAT TIME IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO LEGISLATE OR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS RUBIO. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OMMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I DON'T THINK I WOULD- ONE. STATE GUARDS TO THE TWELVE YEARS AGO ACTUALLY GREET MY COLLEAGUES- I THINK TWELVE YEARS IS REALLY SWEET BUT I'M ALSO FACED A STRONG SUPPORTER OF TERM LIMITS- I THINK- THAT- JUST FOR THE- SAKE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT I THINK HAVING SOME. LIMITS IS IMPORTANT- BUT UP FOR FOUR YEARS CERTAINLY ISN'T ISN'T ENOUGH- IF WE'RE GOING TO AMEND THE BILL I WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE- IF WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THAT. THIS BILL COURSE IS GOING TO GET THROUGH BUT- I HOPE TO BILL TO GET THROUGH TODAY GET TO THE FLOOR WOULD GET ITSELF OVER THE SENATE. BUT JUST BECAUSE IT MOVES ACROSS THE OTHER HOUSE DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- WE CONTINUE THE DEBATE AND MAKE SURE THAT- THAT THAT WE GET IT RIGHT SO WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE MISTER MISTER CHAIR. PRETTY SURE THAT- YEAH I APPRECIATE YOU YOU BRING THIS BEFORE REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION I THINK IT YOU KNOW AND I'D SAY I AGREE WITH ALL THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE I MEAN THERE'S- THE INHERENT CHALLENGES WITH THIS BUT THERE'S ALSO. YOU KNOW REALLY GOOD GOVERNANCE TO THE FACT THAT FOUR YEARS IS FAR TOO SHORT SO. HAPPEN TO HAVE AYE RECOMMENDATION- ON ON YOUR BILL TODAY- AND WOULD ASK THE SENATOR TO CALL THE VOTE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BERMAN HI. BERMAN HIESINGER TELL UMBER ZERO TWO IS NOT LOADING DOT NET. SENATE I LOW. FLOW ON MAYES AYE. MAYES EINMAL. ONE RUBIO. FOR PROVERBIAL. THAT BILL IT HAS FIVE VOTES TO FIVE ZERO TO ONE OF WILL THE ROLE FOR MEMBERS. LET ME KNOW IF I GET THAT WORDING WRONG- NEXT UP WE HAVE I'M MORE ONE ON OUR AGENDA AB TWENTY BY A SMALL NUMBER LEAD. GOOD AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR RIGHT. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY. THE COVER FOR ELECTIONS THAT. AND FOR PERSONALIZADO CHAIR THE MEMBERS ON THIS ISSUE AREA ON THIS ISSUE IT WAS THE FIRST BILL I INTRODUCED ON MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE AND SOMETHING THAT I FEEL VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT. I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE ALL HOLD VERY DEAR AND PUBLIC SERVICES THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC THAT IS WHY I'M DOING THIS BILL BECAUSE I CANNOT OVERSTATE THAT. IF WE LOSE THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC AND THEY THINK WE ARE INFLUENCED. BY THE MONEY RECEIVED AND HOW DECISIONS ARE MADE. OUR DEMOCRACY COMES INTO QUESTION AND WOOD THINGS TURN UGLY OUR DEMOCRACY. AS WIDE SUPPORT TO BE TO BE DOING THIS I PERSONALLY. LIVE BY THE MOTTO THAT YOU KNOW TO PER PREVENT ANY. APPEARANCE OF INFLUENCE OF CORPORATE MONEY OR EVEN TO HAVE THAT EVEN THE BACK OF MY MIND I VOLUNTARILY OPT OUT OF IT. I PERSONALLY DO NOT TAKE ANY CORPORATE MONEY IN ANY FORM. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THAT TRUST BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE THE RULES OF THE GAME. AND THAT WE DID NOT SET THESE ROLES AND WE TALK AND I KNOW FROM TALKING MEMBERS WE DON'T LIKE THE RULES OF THE GAME. BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ACTIVELY CHANGE THEM SO THAT WE CAN GET BACK TO WHAT WE WANT TO DO. TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT PERSONALLY WITH VOTERS TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO THEM AND NOT HAVE TO AUNTS KANSI WORRY ABOUT. THE OVER BLOATED. SPENDING ELECTIONS I BEFORE GOING TO SOME OF OUR BOX I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT AND I REALLY AM THANKFUL FOR ENGAGEMENT OF OUR COLLEAGUES ON THIS ISSUE. AND I KNOW IT'S NOT A COMFORTABLE CONVERSATION ALWAYS BE HAVING BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT ARE THAT THE PEOPLE KALRA DESERVE- I JUST WANT TO DRESS SOMETHING THAT THE ANALYSIS THAT. SOMETHINGS ARE POINTED OUT ABOUT. THE DEFINITION OF BUSINESS ENTITIES OR ABOUT. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER BUSINESS HAD THESE KIND. OF ATTACKS. OR BY CONTRIBUTING POLITICAL PARTIES. ARE THOSE ARE ALL THINGS I'D BE OPEN TO IF THE COMMITTEE WERE TO PROPOSE M. AS AMENDMENTS I WOULD CERTAINLY BE OPEN TO IT. BECAUSE I DO WANT THAT MOST THOROUGH. BILL TO LIMIT. THE INFLUENCE OF CORPORATIONS. YOU KNOW TWENTY TWO OTHER STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. CURRENTLY PROHIBIT DIRECT CONTRIBUTION FROM CORPORATIONS TO CANADA. WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO. IS BRING CALIFORNIA CONFORMITY FOR THE MOST PART. WITH THE TILLMAN ACT OF NINETEEN OH SEVEN. IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A REPRESENT OF DEMOCRACY WITH. THE WAY OUR CURRENT CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM IS SET UP. AND AS NOTED IN A THIS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION. WAS COLLECTED. I WAS COLLECTIVELY RAISED BY THOSE SEEKING OFFICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. 84% OF THAT EIGHTY. 84% OF THAT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WENT TO THE WINNERS. AND OUT OF THAT ONE IN FOUR DONATIONS 25% CAME FROM BUSINESS ENTITIES WHICH MY BILLS SEEKING TO LIMIT. AND OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE. I KNOW THAT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT. WE LOOKED INTO APPROXIMATELY WHAT. ONE IN FOUR DOLLARS CAME FROM IS THAT THE- AND CORPORATIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE ACCOUNTED. LIFT DOOR DASH IN SCAR AND POSTMATES. ANOTHER GLARING EXAMPLES THAT PG&amp;E. GAVE A TOTAL OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. BOTH DURING THE COMPANY'S BANKRUPTCY AND AFTER PLAYED GUILTY TO EIGHTY FIVE FELONIES CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS HARM THE ECONOMY AND ONLY ERODE PUBLIC TRUST IN US. RATHER IT SHOULD PROVIDE PEOPLE RATHER OUR OUR- DEMOCRACY SHOULD BE PROVIDING PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITIES WITHOUT THE INFLUENCE OF BIG CORPORATE MONEY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR SPENT IN BUSINESS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THIS RESULTS IN SIX DOLLARS AND SIXTY FIVE CENTS OF LOWER STATE CORPORATE TAXES. IT REDUCES THE STATE'S REVENUELEADING TO BUDGET CUTS OUR TAXES BEING RAISED ELSEWHERE ON THE HARD LABOR WORKING FAMILIES ADDITIONAL RESEARCH INDICATES THAT STATES WITH STRICTER CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS SPEND MORE MONEY ON ENSURING THE STRENGTH OF THEIR SOCIAL SAFETY THAT. AND THIS SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE AS CORPORATIONS OFTEN OFTEN PRIORITIZE POLICIES THAT INCREASE THE PROFIT MARGINS RENDON THE POLICIES UP WITH THE WELL BEING OF EVERYONE. THE ISSUE WITH HAVING OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM ENTRENCHED IN THE IDEA THAT MONEY IS SPEECH WHAT THE CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE IS THAT YOU ARE EFFECTIVELY. RELEGATING LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FOLKS TO A SECONDARY CITIZEN STATUS WE'RE BEING TOLD THEIR VOICE IS LESS IMPORTANT OF THOSE WITH LOTS OF MONEY THIS TYPE OF GOVERNANCE IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS PLUTOCRACY IN OTHER WORDS A GOVERNMENT RUN BY THE RICH. WHAT THE COVER FOR ELECTION NEXT PROVIDES IS ONE STEP. IN DIRECTION OF A LIMB BIG MONEY FROM POLITICS I UNDERSTAND IT. WILL NOT BE DISCOVERABLE AS WE DESPERATELY NEED FEDERAL ACTION. AND THANKFULLY CONGRESS MEMBER DI PAUL FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON HAS INTRODUCED THE WE THE PEOPLE AMENDMENT. THIS CONSERVE AMENDMENT WOULD END CORPORATE PERSONHOOD REVERSE CITIZENS UNITED AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT MONEY DOES NOT EQUAL SPEECH. WE CAN'T SIT IDLY BY IN SACRAMENTO AND WAIT FOR CONGRESS TO ACT. WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO CURB CORPORATE INFLUENCE AND AB TWENTY IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ROUTING BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS AND I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS IS THIS IS SOMETHING I FEEL VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT. ONE OF THESE CONCERTS ONE OF THESE QUESTIONS REYES AND ANALYSIS IS THAT. IF A FORTY NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION FROM A BUSINESS ENTITY IS SO INFLUENTIAL WHY WENT. A SAME CONTRIBUTION FOR CORPORATE EXECUTIVES IS INFLUENTIAL UNTIL THAT POINT. I AGREE. ALL WITH THE MEANS SHOULD HAVE A LOUDER VOICE IN A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND THOSE WHO CAN'T SPARE FORTY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS. HOWEVER IF AB TWENTY WERE TO PASS A CORPORATE EXECUTIVE WOULD BE ABLE TO DONATE ONCE THROUGH THEIR INDIVIDUAL. I'M SORRY WHAT'S THEIR BUSINESS AND ANOTHER DONATION AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY POINT ABOUT A CONSTITUTION. THAT GUARANTEES ARE OPERATIVE ALL REPRESENTATIVE OPPOSITE THE PEOPLE NOT COOPERATIVE THAT GIVE THE RICH. WE ARE NOT MEANT TO BE AN OLIGARCHY WE ARE BACK TO BE DEMOCRACY FOR PEOPLE. WITH THE DEEPENING INCOME INEQUALITY AND WEALTHY PEOPLE AFFORDED MORE POLITICAL INFLUENCE. IS IMPERATIVE WE COMMIT TO OUR VALUES THAT EACH. AND EVERY PERSON HAS AN EQUAL VOICE. AND THAT CORPORATIONS ARE NOT PEOPLE. AND BEFORE I AND BILL MOVE ON TO OUR SPEAKERS I JUST WANTED OF. I THANK ALL OUR WONDERFUL SUPPORTERS AB TWENTY. LOOK MOVE.

GOOD MORNING MARC BERMAN BERMAN CAST OUR DAILY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ON THE SOUTH DIRECT OF MOBILE MONEY OUT FOLLOWERS. UP THURSDAY A FOLLOW. NON NON PART OR- DEDICATED TO REDUCING THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS AND PROMOTING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONAL SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY. ONE A CORPORATION DONATES TO A CANDIDATE IT IS AN INVESTMENT. IF DONATIONS TO CANDIDATES DID NOT RETURN ON THIS INVESTMENT CORPORATIONS WOULD NOT MAKE THEM. EARLIER THIS MONTH IN AN EMOTIONAL FACEBOOK VIDEO THE PRESIDENT OF THE MAINE SENATE INTRODUCED L. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN. WHICH LIKE AB TWENTY PROHIBITS CORPORATE DONATIONS TO CANDIDATES BUT PERMITS UNION DONATIONS. HE SAID AND I QUOTE. I THOUGHT IF YOU DID THE RIGHT THING PLAYED BY THE RULES THAT GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THERE TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU. AS I'VE HAD MY EYES OPENED UP CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD BETTER THAT FOR FAR TOO LONG. LARGE CORPORATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BY STATE GOVERNMENTS AND REGULAR PEOPLE. JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY THEM BACK. IT'S INCREDIBLY UPSETTING AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO COMPETE WHEN YOUR VOICE IS DROWNED OUT. AND I BELIEVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT MAIN PEOPLE DESERVE A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FIGHT AND DELIVERS FOR REGULAR PEOPLE. EVERYDAY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE BIG BANK ACCOUNTS TO PUSH THEIR ISSUES NOT LARGE CORPORATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS LIKE WE SEE TODAY. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR MAINE PEOPLE ON CLERK. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA EITHER. I HOPE YOU WILL FIND AT SENATOR TRIED JACKSON FINDS FOR MAN. BUT NOW WITH THE TIME AND DIRECT CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS. TO CANDIDATES IN CALIFORNIA WE ASK FOR YOUR I. THE TO ADVANCE AB TWENTY OUT. OF THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. THE YOU VERY MUCH NEXT UP WE HAVE FOR WITH SPEECH PEOPLE ONCE AGAIN EVERYBODY TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU SHARE VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK I'M RUN FINE ON- LEGAL DIRECTOR OF FREE SPEECH FOR PEOPLE AND NATIONAL NONPARTISAN AND NONPROFIT. PUBLIC INTEREST ORGANIZATIONS AND I WANT TO MAKE JUST A FEW POINTS AND I WON'T REPEAT- WITHIN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY. OF FIRST- JUST TO REASSURE THE LAW IS THE BILL IS CONSTITUTIONAL BOTH THE NINTH CIRCUIT AND THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HAS UPHELD. LIMITS OF THIS TYPE AND FURTHERMORE IT IS ACTUALLY THE STANDARD- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL CONGRESS HAS BANNED CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS TYPE IN NINETEEN OH SEVEN AND ABOUT HALF THE STATE DO. BECAUSE FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES PRESENT A SPECIAL RISKS OF CORRUPTION THAT ARE NOT THE TEAM THAT HAS. CONTRIBUTIONS EVEN OF THE SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT FROM I INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN CONVERT CORPORATE TREASURY FUNDS AREN'T IN THE MARKET FOR SELLING GOODS AND SERVICES INTO POLITICAL WAR CHEST. AND ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO HAVE VERY SPECIFIC NARROW DESIRES FOR LEGISLATIVE OR EXECUTIVE FAVORS. SPECIAL TAX TREATMENT REGULATORY TREATMENT LOCAL OR STATE APPROVAL THAT THAT ROBS AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE. HAS CONSISTENTLY WITH INDIVIDUALS I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT- THE BILL COULD RESULT IN A BUSINESS ENTITIES ITS SHIFTING FUNDING TO OTHER CHANNELS. IT'S NOT A FIXED POT WERE ALREADY THERE ANY BUSINESS THAT HAS A SERIOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO SPEND IS RT NOT JUST MAXING OUT DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTING. AS MUCH TO OUTSIDE GROUPS HAS IT FINDS WORTH ECONOMIC WHILE BUT MORE TO THE POINT I THINK- I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU BUT CERTAIN THE COURTS HAVE REPEATEDLY HELD. THAT FOR ANY GIVEN AMOUNT OF MONEY AT BOTH- THE CONTRIBUTORS AND THE CANDIDATES- WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE A DIRECT CONTRIBUTION WHICH THIS BILL PROHIBITS THEN I CONTRIBUTION TO AN OUTSIDE GROUP. AND FINAL POINT IS THAT IN THE HALF OF THE STATE THAT ALREADY DO THAT I DON'T THINK THERE'S MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAYING I THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW. CORPORATIONS TO WRITE CHECKS DIRECTLY TO CANDIDATES THE WAY THE CAL. DOES RIGHT NOW THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH- AND WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO.

WELCOME TO A LINE WHILE- THREE. HELLO MY NAME IS ANTHONY RICARDO ARE I AM A MEMBER OF THE UNITED DEMOCRATS SINGULAR VALLEY ALSO THE WHITTIER AREA DEMOCRATIC CLUB. I STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY AND I URGE YOU TO PLEASE PASS THIS OUT OF POCKET BILL OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE SPEAKERS WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN AND GIVING US YOUR OPINION FOR THOSE THAT DID NOT GET TO DO THAT YOU CAN STILL DO THAT ONLINE JUST GO TO THE ASSEMBLY WEBSITE. AND YOU CAN LEAVE AS LONG OF A SUPPORTER OPPOSITION AS YOU WISH AND THE COMMITTEE WILL GET THAT SO AT THAT POINT THAT IS THAT ALL I THINK THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE. COMMITTEE NOW FOR A QUESTIONS. YOUR A QUESTION COM. DID WE DO I HAD ASKED IF THEY HAD DONE OPPOSITION THERE'S NO PRIMARY OPPOSITION IN THE IN THE QUEUE ARE IN THE- ON THE NOTES SO WE'RE GONNA GO TO. OPPOSITION ONLINE SO IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION ONLINE MODERATOR. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU'RE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE THOSE SPEAKING IN CASE IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD ON GREEN BACK TO THE ROOM TO SEE IF ANYBODY WANTS TO SPEAK ON IN THE ROOM IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT ON THE REMOTE. NOBODY ON THE REMOTE SO NOW WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE IS- WELCOME TO OFFER COMMENTS. QUESTIONS. I'M NOT A COMMITTED TO FOR THE QUESTION- GO AHEAD MR THE CHAIR COULD USA TNT HOW MANY CALLERS ARE STILL LEFT ON THE SUPPORT CALL LINE YEAH I CAN DO THAT- EIGHTEEN T. HOW MANY WERE LEFT ON IT IS ONCE WE MOVE BEYOND THAT WE CLEARED OUT THAT QUEUE. SO WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS TIME IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REOPEN THAT WE COULD NOW THAT'S ALL RIGHT WE GOT IT WE WANT TO KEEP OUR TIMELINE BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE MORE BILLS TO HEAR I DID HAVE OPPOSITION. SINCE ANY OPPOSITION ON THE- FRONT HERE SO. SO ANYWAY WE'RE BRINGING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NOW SO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. JERRY WANTS TO I WILL JUMP IN HERE NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO. SO ADEQUATE QUESTION FOR YOUR YOUR BILL HERE- DOES IT LIMIT THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES. THE BILL AS IN PRINT TODAY DOES NOT LIMIT POLITICAL PARTY CONTRIBUTIONS AS POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS THOUGH I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT IF THE COMMITTEE WHEN I BECAUSE THE POLITICAL PARTIES THEMSELVES ARE NOT LIMITED IN HOW MUCH MONEY THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE. TO A OR SPEND ON A CAMPAñA INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATE. SO ESSENTIALLY BY ELIMINATING THIS TO THE INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATES THEY JUST GIVE IT TO THE POLITICAL PARTY THE POLITICAL PARTY CAN SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS ON ONE CANDIDATE THAT THEY CHOOSE WALL THE OTHER CANDIDATE IS LEFT IS. THIS GREAT FOR WHATEVER YOU CAN DO ON HIS OWN MONEY OR WHATEVER THAT POLITICAL PARTY CAN SPEND ON IT SO THAT CREATES THAT SAME IMBALANCE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- WITH THIS GRANT THAT'S CORRECT AND IF- IF I MAY MISTER. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO AMEND THE BILL TO INCLUDE TO MAKE IT VERY EXPLICIT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AS OUR FEDERAL CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES IN CAN'T TAKE DIRECT CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS THE PARTY CAN ALSO GO AHEAD. OF ME DIRECTLY AND YOU KNOW THE REST OF IT IT'S A- THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH TRYING TO. LEVEL ARE YOU ARE YOU YOU'RE TRYING TO LIKE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. BUT YOU HAVE TO LEVEL IT FOR EVERYBODY AT THE SAME TIME. OTHERWISE IT'S NOT EVER GOING TO BE LEVEL. AND THAT'S THE ISSUE I HAVE WITH THESE ATTEMPTS I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUE WITH TRYING TO GET ALL THAT OUT HERE I'D LOVE IT. BUT IT IT YOU KNOW A GREAT CREATES AN IMBALANCE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO UNLESS YOU DO THE WHOLE THING. AND- SO THIS IS ONLY A PIECE OF IT. AND WE CAN'T DO ONE PIECE AT A TIME BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAT THAT CONTINUES. AND I MEAN YOU DAY IMBALANCE CONTINUES- SO YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU- MONEY NEED TO BE OUT. BUT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO IN IN THE POLITICAL ARENA- WERE STILL THERE. YOU'RE STILL GONNA HAVE SOME INFLUENCE ON YOU AND- ADD TO THE EXTENT THAT. THIS IS YOUR ONLY INCOME THIS COULD BE. THAT COULD BE A DETERMINING FACTOR IN WHETHER YOU'RE SUPPORTING SOMETHING OR NOT. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S IT THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT INFLUENCE YOU AND- THE SUGGESTION BY A BY SOME WHO'VE CALLED AND THAT. WERE FOR SALE YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE FOR SALE BEFORE. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE DEALT WITH. I'M HERE OR NOT. THEY'RE HERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GOOD HARD THEY WANT TO DO WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND SO THAT TO ME DOESN'T PLAY INTO IT AS MUCH AS- THIS IS THIS IMBALANCE THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE AND- YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID I WOULD LOVE TO GET RID OF IT. MISTER CHAIR I'LL HAND IT BACK OVER TO YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER RESTER ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTIONS I THINK THAT MR MAYES AND THE MISTER LOW. YEAH. YOUR BROTHER BEFORE BEING AMONGST THE PALM THAT THERE IS. WHY THAT OTHER. THE WHOLE SYSTEM- AND ACTUALLY WOULD AGREE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM OUR SYSTEM AND MY COLLEAGUES TO MY RIGHT- I JUST TALK ABOUT SOME SOME OF THE- I DON'T THINK ABOUT A LARGE WITH WITH WITH PROBLEMATIC- IS NOT THAT THERE POWERFUL INTEREST GROUP. THAT ARE BECAUSE THERE ARE- BOTH CORPORATE. AND LABOR- OF WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS TO SPEND ON BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT TO SPEND. FIVE WHO'S EXCEPT AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON CAMP- BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE PROBLEM- THE PROBLEM- FRANKLY- IS THE ELECTED OFFICIALS- IT IS IT IS AWESOME I'M REMINDED. OF THE FORMER ASSEMBLY STE DEMOCRATIC SPEAKER- JESS UNRUH. WHO SAID IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE MONEY DRINK THE BOOZE EITHER FOOD ON A PASS OVER THE NEXTONE- AND VOTE AGAINST THEM A YOU DON'T- YOU DON'T BELONG HERE- AND I THINK AT THAT POINT IF YOU DON'T BELONG HERE. IF THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THIS BUILDING- WHO- LIKE THE ONE OF THE FOLKS WHO SAID THAT THEY- THEY SUPPORTED THIS BILL SAID THAT IF SOMEBODY GIVES YOU CONTRIBUTION THAT IT'S AN INVESTMENT AND THEY WANT TO RETURN ON INVESTMENT IF THAT'S THE CASE. THOSE FOLKS DON'T BELONG HERE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE RUN AND IT SHOULD NOT CONTINUE. TO BE HERE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT OUR SYSTEM SYSTEM WAS SET UP AND SO- YOU KNOW I ALSO AGREE WITH- WITH MY WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM A FROM MURRIETA THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BILL LIKE THIS- YOU HAVE TO DO IT HAS TO GO. MUCH FURTHER- AND YET EVEN WHEN YOU GO THAT FAR IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT JUST BUSINESSES IT'S IF YOU HAD BUSINESSES AND LABOR ANY ASSOCIATION ANY TWO GROUPS COMING TOGETHER IF YOU SAY AN S. CORPORATION FOR INSTANCE CAN'T GIVE BETWEEN. TWO PARTNERS BECAUSE THAT'S ALL AN S. CORPORATION AS AS CORPORATION AS A COULD BE- TWO PARTNERS AND IF YOU SAY THEY CAN'T GIVE BUT A HUSBAND A WIFE-CAN GIVE- BECAUSE THEY'RE INDIVIDUALS IT REALLY IS THE SAME THING IS STILL INDIVIDUALS. AT THAT THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE GIVING IT SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO GO VERY FAR BUT THEN THE REALITY IS THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE CORPORATIONS AND THERE'S A FEW VERY VERY WEALTHY DONORS THAT COMETO MIND THAT RIGHT VERY VERY LARGE- INDIVIDUAL. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WE GONNA LIMIT LIMIT THEIR SPEECH AS WELL AND SO WELL I THINK YOUR INTENT IS RIGHT I THINK THAT THE BILL BEFORE US- IS FLAWED IN IN IN IN MANY RESPECTS AGAIN I KNOW YOUR HEART I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM FRANKLY IS AT THE HEART OF ALL OF US THAT ARE HERE THAT HAS BEEN SOLID IN THE PUBLIC HAS SEEN NOT BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PEOPLE LIKE JUST ON RECETTE BOTH SPOKE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HERE SO THANK YOU. YOU MISTER MISS MISTER LOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR- AND- THANK YOU SIMILARLY FOR BRINGING THE ISSUE. TO US HERE TODAY FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF- AS YOU MAY KNOW I SERVED AS A PREVIOUS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. NASSAR TO ANY OF A NUMBER OF YEARS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND- WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO TRY TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. AS YOU WELL KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE I WAS THE AUTHOR OF A PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THIS AND- THE COMMITTEE PROVIDED THE PRIVILEGE TO HAVE DIALOGUE. TO ADDRESS THIS IN OPEN FORUM. AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS THAT THAT IS THE JOB THAT WE HAVE IS A DELIVER YOUR BODY TO ALLOW FOR THAT CONVERSATION AND DIALOGUE TO OCCUR. WHILE DOING THE HARD WORK IN IRONING OUT AND HAVING AND HEARING FROM EACH OTHER ABOUT. WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FROM OUR DEMOCRACY AND ALLOWING FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TOSS AWAY AND SO. AGAIN I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE CHAIR IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING THIS PROCESS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. TO HELP FACILITATE THIS CONVERSATION- I ALSO- I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT WITH SOME OF THE STATEMENTS THAT YOU MADE. IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS AS BOTH OF US HAIL FROM SILICON VALLEY. I'M PART OF THE RHETORIC I THINK IS DANGEROUS AND SAYING THAT- CORPORATION IS BAD OR IN PEOPLE ARE GOOD- BUT RATHER THE LIFEBLOOD OF SILICON VALLEY OUR COMMUNITY HAPPENS TO BE THAT. OF CORPORATIONS WHEN WE LIKE THAT OR NOT THAT IS THE REALITY OF HIGH PAYING JOBS. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A TRAJECTORY OF. HIGH PAYING JOBS AND SUPPORTING PEOPLE OF COLOR ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO STEM. A WOULD BE APPLE NETFLIX EBAY THAT IS WHAT SILICON VALLEY IS MADE IN FACT WE'VE SEEN THAT SILICON VALLEY HAS. HELPED KEEP US OFF OF THE CLIFF FINANCIAL CLIFF. WITH RESPECT THE PANDEMIC SO I JUST. WANT TO JUST SHARE THAT OBSERVATION THAT I RICH CAUTION WHEN TALKING ABOUT GOOD VERSUS BAD. AND THAT OF. A JUST THE WEALTHY SERVING IN GOVERNMENT I THINK YOU BRING ME SOME TYPE OF REFERENCE OF THAT. AS A MILLENNIAL AS AGENCY YOU AND I BOTH. ARE SERVING AS MEMBERS OF THIS INSTITUTION IN A RESPECTABLE INSTITUTION. IN UNITED BOTH CANNOT LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT. BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE'S NO WORK TO BE DONE SO. I JUST THINK THAT'S ALSO BEEN POINT TO SAY SO JUST URGING CAUTION WHEN TALKING ABOUT. WHAT IS A GOOD OF VIABILITY GOOD CONTRIBUTION. AND WHAT IS- BAD. AND WOOD. I THINK DISTINCTION HERE ALSO. DOING THE KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR FROM OF A CHAIR HEARD FROM SENATE MAY ABOUT. THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY. AND HOW DO WE GET THAT OUT INTO A TOTALITY AND THAT'S WHY THE WHOLE REFERENCE EARLIER THE HARD WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO ADDRESSING THAT AND MOVING FORWARD. BUT I HOPE THAT WE DON'T PROVIDE A FALSE SENSE OF HOPE. TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS IS THE PERFECT ITERATION. YOU OF COURSE WERE KIND ENOUGH TO SAY THAT YOU WERE WILLING TO TAKE AMENDMENTS AND WORKING TO SEE ON THESE ISSUES. YOU KNOW I HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS. TO WHICH I DO NOT BRING THIS BEFORE THIS YEAR BECAUSE I WAS. PARTICULARLY TAKEN BY THE ARGUMENTS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT A HOLISTIC APPROACH. AND HOW WE DO THIS AND MAINTAINING. THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS WHEN IT COMES TO CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. I KNOW HAT THIS CHAIR AND THIS COMMITTEE IS EQUALLY COMMITTED. TO DOING SO- I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS. BILL BEFORE US TODAY WHILE IT IS FLAWED BECAUSE I DO WANT TO SEE THAT. CONVERSATION TO OCCUR BUT- I DO ALSO WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENT. THOUGH TO GIVE ME A GREATER SENSE OF- UP OF APPROACH THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE WITH RESPECT TO. HELPING TO ENSURE THAT WE TACKLE THIS AS A WHOLE IF WE BELIEVE FUNDAMENTALLY THAT. THERE IS UNDUE INFLUENCE OF. CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THEY SHOULD LOOK AT A HOLISTIC APPROACH AND A WIDE LEVEL. BUT I JUST- AGAIN URGE CAUTION IN SAYING THAT CORPORATIONS BUSINESSES ARE BAD AND WE WANT TO. ELIMINATE THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR THEIR APPROACH BECAUSE- AS I'VE HEARD BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IT'S LIKE A LEAKY BUCKET YOU PLUG ONE HOLE IN THE- BAR COMES IN DIFFERENT DIRECTION AS WE'VE HEARD FROM. THE STAFF ANALYSIS AS WELL TOO SO AGAIN LIKE A COMMAND OF THE PROJECT THAT YOU'RE MAKING BUT- HOPE TO GO TO WORK WITH YOU. TO ENSURE THAT AGAIN HAILING FROM SILICON VALLEY THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE. OF HARD WORKING PEOPLE AND ALSO CORPORATIONS WHILE ALSO DOING THE NECESSARY WORK TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL TOO. SO I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT AND WITH THAT I'LL MAKE A MOTION TO SUPPORT THANK YOU MR LOW. MAYES RUBIO YES THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER LEE AND YOU KNOW I AS WELL APPRECIATE THAT THE CONVERSATION AND- YOU KNOW WHEN WE- ALSO TO MR. LOWEST POINT WARM WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CREEK RATIONS CORPORATE. ARE NOT NECESSARILY. MULTI DOLLAR. I'VE HAVE. PLAYED OF CORPORATION ARE ONE PERSON CORPORATIONS THAT MAKE YOU KNOW- ENOUGH TO SURVIVE SUCH AS- YOU KNOW BLANK LATELY MAKING A STATEMENT THAT CORPORATIONS ARE ALL BAD OR- ARE NECESSARILY ARE RICH. FOR EXAMPLE IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND- YOU KNOW AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE- AND I THINK YOU AND I HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT TO. MY COLLEAGUES POINTS. YOU KNOW WHERE DO YOU. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE PICKING THE WINNERS AND LOSERS OF THIS THIS GAME AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF. US WOULD NOT BE HERE WOULD NOT. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE HELP OF. LOCAL CORPORATIONS- FOR EXAMPLE BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW NOT JUST. OF MONEY IS NOT JUST GIVING DIRECTLY TO CANDIDATES WE ALSO HAVE INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES TO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS. WE'RE LIMITING YOU KNOW THE- ACCOUNTABILITY IF YOU WELL BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DISCLOSE. WHO WE RECEIVE- THE CONTRIBUTIONS FARM. THE INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES. DON'T HAVE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS. THAT WE AS INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO FILE. AND SO THAT ALSO. GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO HIDE MONEY. AND SPEND WHAT YOU MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND I CAN ATTEST. FROM MY YOUTH MY RAISING MY SIBLINGS REYES. THAT THAT IT WAS. MULTI MILLION DOLLAR- EXPENDITURES THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY- HAVE- AS SOMEONE WERE WOULD HAPPEN BUT ALL WE'RE GIVING THE POWER TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS TO BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE MONEY. AND TAKING IT AWAY FROM THE LOCAL FOLKS THAT DO WANT TO SEE BETTER MEN IN THEIR- ARE COMMUNITIES SO I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT AND AGAIN WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BUT- AT THIS MOMENT I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL AND IS. UNLESS WE DO- AS MY- COLLEAGUES TO THE WRITER ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES SAID THAT WE DO A COMPREHENSIVE WITH EVERYBODY IF WE'RE GOING TO- HAVE EVERYBODY- YOU KNOW BE AT THE SAME STANDARD AND EVERYBODY HAS TO BE. INPUTTED INTO THE INTO THE BILL AND ELIMINATE ALL OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE BILL BEFORE US. BY I CAN NOT SUPPORTED IN ITS CURRENT STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- A- MISSILE WE WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPLY TO ANYBODY YOU WANT TO ARE ALSO MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. YEAH I JUST WANT TO REPLY DO LOOK OF WHAT THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES AND YOU KNOW I AM COMMITTED TO WHOLESALE REFORM I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS VERY VERY MUCH BROKEN. AND YOU KNOW WHY THE BILL IS TAILORED THE WAY IT IS AT THE MOMENT IS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH IN A VERY NARROW BAND OF CONSTITUTIONALITY OR EVEN. GRAYSON ACROSS SHOULD I WHICH IS SAFE BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A FAVORABLE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW IT'S THE SAME SUPREME COURT THAT DELIVERED US. THIS IS UNITED THAT SAID CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE AND THAT HAVE UNLEASHED A TIDAL WAVE OF MONEY. OF BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO WORK ON THESE THINGS YOU KNOW I DO COMMIT TO HOPEFULLY WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUESAT THIS. IN A IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER RIGHT WE HAVE TO AND I JUST COMMITTEE CONSTANTLY LOOK THAT WE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. AND HOPEFULLY THE FUTURE PUBLIC FINANCING TO READ LEVEL PLAYING CARDS THE PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME SPENDING POWER- AND THEN MAKING SURE WE'RE ALSO HAVING LIMITATIONS RESULT LIMITATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD FOR EVERY SORT OF CANDID RIGHT. MY BILL- BUILD UPON THE GREAT WORK FROM ASSEMBLY BELOW- BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO EXPAND THIS TO ALL. CANDIDATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT INCLUDE RIGHT RATHER ITS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS KIND OF DIVIDE THEIR STATE LEGISLATORS THE GOVERNOR. WHO ALL HAVE CERTAIN PLEASE SIX DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROLES BUT THERE STILL IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INFANTS OR EVEN THE PERCEPTION THAT ONCE WHICH CAN JUST BE A DANGER START MOXIE- SO REALLY COMMITTED TO CONSTANT WORKING ON THESE ISSUES BUT- AGAIN YOU KNOW WORKING WITHIN. THE CONFINES OF THE CONCERT. AS IT IS. RIGHT AND UNTIL I THINK WE HAVE A CONCERTED EFFORT AND SOMETIMES IT WILL TAKE A PIECE OF PURCHASE WE HAVE TO HIT ONE AT A TIME. TO GET THERE I THINK WE- YEAH REFORMS LIKE AB TWENTY WILL WILL BE UNNECESSARY BUT I DO COMMITTEE KANSI WORKING WITH YOU ALL BECAUSE I THINK. IRONICALLY IT IS PERHAPS THE ONE ISSUE EVERYWHERE EVERYONE IS BUILDING HAS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH. SO WE ALL KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET A RIGHT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RESTORE THE TRUST OF PEOPLE. FAMOUSLY ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES SEEING NOT- YES MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- AND IS YOUR MIKE ON THE MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF SURE BERMAN AND- AS- MY COLLEAGUE OF MR LOS AT- I'D LIKE TO COMPLIMENT YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING- SOME COMMITTEE CHAIRS- WOULD JUST SIMPLY COULD NOT LET THIS BILL COME UP FOR BECAUSE IT IS CONTROVERSIAL AND- CAUSES SOME ANGST FOR- FOR PEOPLE IN TERMS OF THEIR POSITION. AND CERTAINLY THAT ANGST IS THAT- IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM IF YOU DECIDE NOT SECOND THE MOTION OR WHATEVER IT MEANS YOU'RE IN FAVOR OF BIG MONEY IN POLITICS AND THAT'S THE YOU KNOW THAT'S SORT OF THE SIMPLE UP APPROACH AND SO TO AVOID THAT SOMETIMES JURORS DON'T LET SOMETHING COME FORWARD BUT TO YOUR CREDIT AND TO THE CREDIT OF EVERYBODY HERE- WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE OUR- OUR FEELINGS ABOUT THIS EARLY IN THE IN THE PROCESS AND STUFF SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY IN PARTICULAR TO- I HEARD SOME VERY- STRONG SUPPORTERS OF MINE ON THE PHONE HERE- TODAY- WITH THE BILL AND THAT SO I WANT TO SAY HELLO TO THEM BECAUSE I- PROPITIATE THEIR LONG TERM AND STEADY SUPPORT FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM THAT THAT WE'VE WORKED OUT BUT- BIG MONEY'S CORRUPTING DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE I MEAN YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T SEVEN PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF COUNTRIES ARE JUST YOU KNOW COMPLETELY- DICTATORIAL X. SENTARA- IN TERMS OF THE CORRUPTION AND WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY SAFEGUARDS AS WE NEED AND BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A SERIOUS PROBLEM I'VE FOUGHT TO DECREASE THE INFLUENCE OF BIG MONEY IN POLITICS FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I'M PROUD THAT- IN MANY OF MY CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO VOLUNTARILY LIMIT MY- CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS- I'VE REFUSE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AND I JUST THINK IF YOU JUST LOOK AT MY TRACK RECORD EVERYWHERE YEAH THE TRACK RECORD THAT I'M PROUD OF IN TERMS OF NOT TAKING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE UNDUE INFLUENCE AS A RESULT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. DEVELOPERS OF. ECCENTRIC CENTER PEOPLE HAVE TO ANYBODY HAD A CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY- ALL OF THE KIND OF. AND I'VE- AND ONE A DAY. OF SIX. CAMP FINANCE REFORM LAWS. INCLUDING WHAT IS WIDELY LABELED AS TO TOUGHEST CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS- AND- I'VE LEARNED THAT. IN DOING ALL OF THAT AND WRITING THOSE LAWS- OF. THAT THERE ARE CONSTANT BATTLES AND PUSH BACK AND LEGAL- LOOPHOLES THAT PEOPLE USE TO TRY TO GET AROUND THOSE LAWS. SO I'VE LEARNED A REFORM IN THIS FIELD IS VERY CHALLENGING TO MAKE PARTICULARLY GOOD REFORM THAT THAT DISTRACTS PEOPLE'S FAIR CENTER. AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE LAUNCH REFORM EFFORT. BOTH EXACTLY WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT. IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO OUR ABILITY IN THE LONG RUN TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS. TO WIN CAMPAIGN REFORM THAT DECREASES THE INFLUENCE OF BIG MONEY IN POLITICS. IF WE DON'T DO IT PROPERLY IN OUR EFFORTS WE ACTUALLY SET OURSELVES BACKWARDS IN THE EFFORT- I HIGHLIGHT MR LOS MOVE. DECISION NOT TO RUN SOMETHING THIS YEAR BECAUSE HE WANTED TO TRY TO TAKE THE TIME TO HAVE TO GET SOMETHING. SO FOR SOME OF THE IMPLICATION OF NOT CHECKING THIS MOTION TODAY AND I WON'T BE SECOND. IMPLIES A SUPPORT OF BIG MONEY IN POLITICS- NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH FOR ME- IT'S CERTAINLY NOT MY POSITION OR MY LONG TERM GOALS REMEMBER THIS ASSEMBLY. BUT WHEN I MOVE FORWARD I WANT TO- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH. WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT IS SOMETHING I FEEL IS APPROPRIATE. THE WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING TO MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU. MISTER BENNETT AND- I'LL MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND THEN- MISTER WE GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY. TO CLOSE I APPRECIATE THAT. THE COMMENTS FOR MY CALL TODAY AND YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD SECOND PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING THAT MR BENNETT SAID I SEE THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE GENERALLY SHARED DESIRE. FOR AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT IS FAIR TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE. AND I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE AUTHOR. AND THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL ABOUT THE ROLE THAT LARGE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES. CAN AND SOMETIMES DO PLAY IN OUR ELECTIONS SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR PASSION. FOR THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND YOUR INTEREST IN TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE. OF CAMPAIGN SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS THEN I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR DEMOCRACY. IN MY TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY I'VE SUPPORTED EFFORTS TO ALLOW FOR PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING PROGRAMS AND EVEN AUTHORED LEGISLATION. TO FACILITATE THOSE PROGRAMS. IN AN EFFORT TO ENCOURAGE MORE DIVERSE PARTICIPATION IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND TO GIVE CANDIDATES AN ALTERNATIVE. TO RELYING ON CAMPAIGN COUNTRY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PRIVATE DONORS. AND BASED ON THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS BILL. I KNOW THAT YOU ALSO HAVE AN INTEREST IN EXPLORING CAN'T PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING PROGRAMS. WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR SENTIMENTS BEHIND THIS BILL. THE ACTUAL BILL LANGUAGE. WHICH IS THE PART THAT MATTERS. FALLS WOEFULLY SHORT OF ACCOMPLISHING THE GOALS YOU WHEN YOU'RE SUPPORTERS CLAIM THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHES. WHEN YOU WHEN I FIRST DISCUSS YOUR INTEREST IN TIS ISSUE IN MID NOVEMBER. BEFORE YOU'RE EVEN SWORN IN- I ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FROM MR LOW'S BILL LAST SESSION. IN THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN THAT ANALYSIS. NOT ONLY DOES IT SEEM THAT YOU DID NOT DO THIS. SINCE THIS BILL HAS MANY OF THE SAME FLAWS AS THE EARLIER BILLS. YOU ADD A FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS SECTION THAT DECEIVES THE PUBLIC. AND YOUR SUPPORTERS. ASKED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR PROPOSAL. YOU ARE BEMOANING THE FACT THAT CORPORATIONS. SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON BALLOT PROPOSITIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY. IMPLYING THAT YOUR BILL WILL ADDRESS THIS. HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BE VERY CLEAR WITH THE PUBLIC THEY YOUR BILL THERE'S NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CORPORATIONS CAN SPEND ON BALLOT PROPOSITIONS. YOU CLAIM THAT THIS BILL WILL QUOTE BRING US IN CONFORMITY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TWENTY TWO STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS IS ALSO VERY MISLEADING. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CLEARLY STATES FEDERAL LAW AND THE LAW AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE TWENTY TWO STATES IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. THE TERM YOU USE BUSINESS ENTITY. IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE DEFINITION F CORPORATION THAT IS USED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE OTHER STATES AND YOU ALLUDED TO. CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS BUT BUT CLEARLY IF THOSE DEFINITIONS ARE USED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE OTHER STATES THOSE ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY SOUND. USING THE TERM BUSINESS ENTITY IS YOUR BILL DOES CREATES LOOPHOLES SO BIG YOU COULD DRIVE AN ARMORED TRUCK THROUGH THEM. THERE ARE ALSO LEGITIMATE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND ELECTION LAW EXPERTS LIKE JESSICA LEVINSON FROM THE GET THE OIL LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL. THAT AB TWENTY WON'T ACTUALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CORPORATE SPENDING AND POLITICS. WE'LL JUST SHIP THAT SPENDING TO LESS TRANSPARENT AND LESS ACCOUNTABLE ROUTES LIKE IS NOT PROGRESS. WHEN WE SPOKE ABOUT A MONTH AGO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO AMEND THIS INTO A STUDY BILL. AND TO ENGAGE EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE ON THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS AS WELL AS THE ISSUE. OF PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING. YOU POLITELY DECLINE MY SUGGESTION WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY YOUR PREROGATIVE. AND REQUESTED THAT THE BILL RECEIVED A HEARING WHICH IT HAS. IF THE BILL DOES NOT MAKE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO REVISIT MY SUGGESTION. TO ENGAGE WITH EXPERTS INCLUDING SOME ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND TRULY TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THIS IMPORTANT. BUT COMPLICATED POLICY. THANK YOU MISSILE MISSILE A I'D GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM. VENTURA COUNTY SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. AS A LISTED TO- YEAH I WANNA THANK YOU OR GIVING OPPORTUNE TO HAVE THIS BILL HEARD EVEN THOUGH IT IS CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE AND AGAIN AND I'M COMFORTABLE ISSUE- AS THE ANALYSIS THAT NOTED. IN A TWENTY TWENTY CYCLE. ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ARE SPENT TO JUST TWO CANDIDATES SEEKING OFFICE AN EXACT AMOUNT OF. OUT OF THAT AMOUNT OVER TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IS DIRECTLY FOR CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH WE SEEK TO ELIMINATE. AND THAT AVERAGES OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO BE OVER TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH. NOW THIS OBJECTIVELY IN THE BRAND SCOPE OF MONEY IS RELATIVELY SMALL BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR OPTIONS HAVE BECOME SO BLOATED. IS A LOT OF MONEY TO EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STILL MAKING MINIMUM WAGE WERE STILL STRUGGLING TO THE PANDEMIC. AND YET THERE'S MILLION TO MILLION DOLLARS FLOWING EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC ELECTION CYCLE- I THINK AB TWENTY IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN A PETROL SEPTA MAKING FOR THE REFORM THAT WE ALL WANT TO DO. OF COURSE IT'S NOT PERFECT AND AGAIN HAVING KNOWLEDGE IS NOT A SILVER BULLET BUT IT'S SOMETHING I COMMITTED TO KEEP WORKING ON IF IT'S OR CUT OFF COMMITTEE. WHERE TO KEEP MAKING IT- IMPROVEMENTS TO IT AND MAKING SURE THAT IS UNIFORM. ALSO THAT WE ARE TACKLING THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- AND JUST QUICKLY YOU KNOW. RUN FINE WHO TALKED ON OUR CALL WAS WITNESSED. HE AND HE MADE A REALLY GOOD POINT IS THAT THIS CORPORATE MONEY IS NOT FIX POT. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL AVENUES OF INFLUENCE RIGHT I EAT INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES PACKS AND OUR COUNTRY'S BEING SOME OF THEM JUST BECAUSE RECALLS DOOR ONE OF THEM DOES NOT NET IN A- UP A EXACT AMOUNT GOING TO THE OTHERS. THESE ARE ALL AVENUES THEY'RE CURRENTLY USING TO INFLUENCE OUR DEMOCRACY AND WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN WITHIN OUR POWER TO LIMITING IT. I REALLY HOPE TO GET YOUR SUPPORT TODAY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THAT MOTION FAILS FOR LACK OF A SECOND. BUT THE BILL REMAINS IN IN THE COMMITTEE- AND BEFORE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIM ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU THINK INITIALLY. THAT'S HONORABLY. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT BILL ON THE AGENDA. MR MCCARTY. EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY NINE. WE HAVE A MOTION. SECOND AND THE SECOND OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION THE SECOND THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT INCREASING OUR DEMOCRACY FOR COUNTY ELECTIONS RELATED TO NOT ONLY D. A. AND SHERIFF BUT ASSESSOR ANOTHER LOCAL COUNTY RACES THIS ISSUE CAME OUT HERE IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE- THE SIGNIFICANT- SPECIFICALLY THE DA AND SHERIFF FOR A RACES THERE HELD DURING GUBERNATORIAL YEARS NOT DURING HAVE AS MUCH TURNED OUT- IN INCOME IS LIKE SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES THE TURNOUT IS- MANY TIMES- DOUBLE IN A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR SO MORE PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN IMPORTANT COUNTY WIDE ELECTIONS. I CERTAINLY THINK IS A POSITIVE- LOCAL GOVERNMENT IMPACTS OUR DAILY LIVES IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WOULD ALLOW A GREATER NUMBER OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ENGAGE ON SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICES IN COUNTY GOVERNMENT- WITH ME TODAY ARE THE LAKE WOMAN VOTERS AND INITIATE JUSTICE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MCCARTY AND AS YOU SAID WE'VE GOT- TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- INTERVIEWS FISHER AND TANYA ON JELLY VARGAS- YEAH BELIEVE IT TESTIFYING BY TELEPHONE A REMINDER YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES- PER WITNESS. FOR TESTIMONY PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING ARE I SHOULD SAY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS INTERNET STRUCTURE I AM A PUBLIC POLICY COORDINATOR WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN FIVE NINE. AT LEAST BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRACY INSTRUMENTS WINNER PRESENTED AT THE TWO THOUSAND AND ELECTIONS OF THE HIGH STREET AND BROADEST DIVERSITY AND VOTER TURNOUT. IT'S A WELL ESTABLISHED FACT THAT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE TRACK SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VOTERS THAN THE TERM COMBINATORIAL ELECTIONS. IN SOUTH ACT THAT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ATTRACTED. MORE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF VOTERS. ACCORDING TO THE FRANK DEMOCRACY WHEN COMPARING THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. TURNOUT OF ELIGIBLE ASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS INCREASED BY FIFTEEN PERCENT. AND TURNOUT OF ELIGIBLE LATINO VOTERS INCREASED EIGHTEEN PERCENT. A SIMILAR TREND CAN BE SEEN YOU VOTER TURNOUT WHICH INCREASED ELECTION. THE DATA HERE IT'S CLEAR CANDIDATES ELECTED DURING MID TERM ELECTIONS ARE SELECTED BY SMALLER LESS REPRESENTATIVE PROPORTION OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS. AMERICAN OF ELECTED DURING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEARS. AB SEVEN FIVE NINE LONG COURAGE MARKETERS TO PARTICIPATING COUNTY ELECTIONS ALLOW MORE UNDERREPRESENTED VOTERS TO PARTICIPATE MAKING CRUCIAL LOCAL DECISION. WILL THEREFORE INCREASE ILLEGITIMACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICES. ENSURING THAT A LARGER AND MORE CRITICAL ABOUT OUR SKIN COLOR THE CANDIDATES REFLECT THEIR VALUES IS CRITICAL TO MAKING DEMOCRACY WORK. FOR THESE REASONS THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA'S IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN FIVE NINE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO TANYA FROM INITIATE JUSTICE. GOOD AFTERNOON HEARING MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIENE OF OUR GUESTS AND THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INITIATE CHESTER- INITIATE JUSTICE. INITIATIVE TO THE VIKING AND NOTHING CORPORATION BY ACTIVATING THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION INITIATE JUSTICE ISN'T STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY NINE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL INCREASE POLITICAL EQUALITY AND ENCOURAGE INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION FOR IMPORTANT COUNTY ELECTED POSITIONS. SAY THE VOTER TURNOUT OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS REVEAL THAT VOTER PARTICIPATION AT HIGHER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION- THAN IT IS FOR GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION SPECIFICALLY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA FOUND THAT IF ELECTIONS WERE MOVED TO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR THE STATE COULD BE AN OVERALL 31% INCREASE IN VOTER TURNOUT. COUNTY OFFICIAL COUNTY OFFICES INCLUDE ROLES SUCH AS COUNTY SHERIFF'S AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S GOVERNMENT THE IMPACT THE LIVELIHOODS AND FREEDOM OF THE MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES THEREFORE IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE PARTICIPATING COUNTY ELECTIONS BECAUSE THIS ENSURE THAT THOSE OFFICES ARE TRULY REPRESENTED HALF OF THE YEAR HAVE THEIR LAUGHTER AT. BLACKLEY MOVING TO RED HOOK MOVING ELECTIONS FOR COUNTY WIDE OFFICE FOR MID TERM ELECTION CYCLE TO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CYCLE MAY RESULT IN A MORE BALANCED NUMBER. OF CONTACTS ON THE BALLOT EACH.

WHICH APPEARED ON THE BALLOT SOUGHT TO REMOVE FROM THE CITY CHARTER ALL REFERENCES TO THE- HAVE A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HOWEVER MEASURE G.

AB FIFTEEN FORTY SIX ALSO ADDRESS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE OUTDATED REFERENCES IN THE CITY OF ALHAMBRA CHARTER. RELATED TO ELECTIONS AT THE ALHAMBRA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CONFLICT WITH THE DISTRICT EFFORT TO ADOPT THE TRUSTEE AREA ELECTION MODEL. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS HE PER THE CITY PLACE THE MEASURE ON THE BALLOT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO REMOVE THE OUTDATED LANGUAGE AND% REFERENCES TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THEIR CHARTER. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO AN ERROR IN INTERPRETING THE CITY ELECTION REVOLUTION THAT MEASURE ONLY APPEARED ON BALLOTS FOR VOTERS WITHIN THE CITY OF ALHAMBRA AND DID NOT APPEAR ON BALLOTS FOR VOTERS.

APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATIONS THAT- MISTER CHAIR UNITED HAD ABOUT THIS BILL AND WITH STAFF I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE WAY THAT ALL OF OUR COMMITTEES IN THIS- IN THIS HOUSE SHOULD BE AND SO- AGAIN THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH- I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN PARAGRAPH FOUR FIVE AND SIX. AND SO I WILL BE SPEAKING ON THIS BILL AS AS AMENDED. FOR THE ACTIVE VOTING IS OUR MOST POWERFUL FORM OF FREE SPEECH. OUR FOUNDERS ENVISIONED A SYSTEM OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY WHERE INDIVIDUALS COULD SPEAK COLLECTIVELY. TO ELECT THOSE WHO BEST REPRESENTED THEIR POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL PREFERENCES. WELL A FLURRY OF POLITICAL PARTIES MARKET NATION'S INFANCY SINCE THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN DOMINATED BY JUST TWO PARTIES. CALIFORNIA LAW GIVES IMMENSE IMMENSE ADVANTAGES TO EXISTING ORGANIZED POLITICAL PARTIES. WHAT CREATING MULTIPLE BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE NEW MOVEMENTS. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT ONLY SEVEN NEW POLITICAL% PARTIES OF QUALIFIED TO PARTICIPATE IN CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS. WITH SIX PARTIES QUALIFYING THROUGH VOTER REGISTRATION AND ONLY ONE QUALIFYING. THROUGH THE PETITION PROCESS BUT THEY FAILED TO STOP AT THE STATE QUALIFY FOR SUBSEQUENT ELECTIONS. WHEN THEY FAILED TO REGISTER ENOUGH VOTERS. OUR TWO PARTY SYSTEM DOES NOT REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT POLITICAL MAKE UP. CALLS FOR NEW OPTIONS REVERBERATE THROUGH THE BASE OF BOTH PARTIES AND A GROWING NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS DO NOT IDENTIFY. WITH EITHER. AS AMENDED THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES NEEDED ON A PETITION TO FORM A NEW POLITICAL PARTY FROM TEN PERCENT. 5% PUTTING CALIFORNIAN LINE WITH MOST OTHER STATES. THIS BILL ALSO SEEKS TO FORGET NAMES A PRIOR UNSUCCESSFUL POLITICAL MOVEMENTS BY ALLOWING A NEW POLITICAL BODY. TO REGISTER WITH THE NAME IT HAS BEEN ABANDONED FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET A FULL RECORD OF PRIOR ATTEMPTS BY POLITICAL BODIES TO QUALIFYBECAUSE- A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE RECORDS ARE ON PAPER ARCHIVES. SO ONE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW A SIMILAR EFFORT WAS MADE IN THE PAST INTO THE APPLY TO SECRETARY OF STATE. STATE LAW REQUIRES THE SECRETARY TO REJECT THE USE OF A POLITICAL PARTY NAME IF IT HAS EVER BEEN USED OR IS EVEN SIMILAR TO A NAME PROPOSED BY ANY PRIOR POLITICAL BODY. TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS REGISTERING WITH THE NEW POLITICAL BODY REFLECT DEVISE A PRIOR MOVEMENTS WITH TE NOW ABANDONED NAME. THIS BILL WOULD ONLY ALLOW REGISTRATION SIGN IN THE YEAR TO THE OFFICIAL EFFORT TO COUNT TOWARDS THE POINT 33% VOTER REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS. LASTLY THIS BILL FORMALIZES SECRETARY STATE PROCEDURES FOR AN APPEALS PROCESS. WHEN APPLYING FOR A POLITICAL PARTY NAME- I UNDERSTAND THE LAST WEEK WE RECEIVED A SUPPORT OPPOSITION LETTER INCLUDING. COMMENTS ON THE FIVE FOR THRESHOLD WHICH WAS REMOVED FROM THE BILL. WHAT WE DID INITIALLY PROPOSED THIS CHANGE THAT WE AGREED TO REMOVE IT- WITH THAT WITH OUR CONVERSATIONS- AND THERE'S SOME ISSUES THERE- AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION ON THE BILL- AS THIS MEASURE IS- IS OFFICE SPONSORED- I LOOK FORWARD. TO HAVING SOME DISCUSSIONS I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY ELSE- HERE TO TALK. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PERFECT. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES- WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE TO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I HAVE- CT FIRST CD WEBER WITH THE PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY OF CALIFORNIA. AND AS A REMINDER YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES FOR OPPOSITION TESTIMONY AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON- TO MY FEINSTEIN. HI MY NAME IS SIKI WEBER I'M HE LEGISLATIVE PLACED ON FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN AB FOUR FOUR SIX FIRST INTRODUCED. THE FREEDOM PARTY VOTED TO SUPPORT IT. BECAUSE IT MADE IT EASIER FOR NEW PARTIES TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. AFTER PARTIES MAINTAIN THEIR BALLOT STATUS. HAVE YOU EVER SUPPORTED AND IDEAS THAT. DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE OF UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES. WELL THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE RECENTLY AMENDED AB FOUR FOUR SIX THE- IT IS BASED ON A GOOD IDEA PROVIDING MORE CHOICES. HOWEVER AN IMPORTANT PILLAR OF THIS BILL WAS REMOVED. THE PART THAT MADE IT JUST AS EASY TO MAINTAIN BALLOT STATUS AS IT WAS TO QUALIFY IN THE FIRST PLACE. HISTORICALLY THERE HAS BEEN A SATURATION POINT WHERE NOT ALL THE BALLOT QUALIFIED PARTIES WERE ABLE TO SURVIVE. SO IF YOU MAKE IT EASY. TO QUALIFY COMMONSENSE DICTATE BUT YOU ALSO MAKE IT EASIER TO MAINTAIN BALLOT STATUS. UNDER AB FOUR FOUR SIX IF I KNEW PARTY WERE TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT BY GETTING THE SIGNATURES OF 3% OF THE NUMBER OF VOTERS WHO VOTED IN THE LAST FIFTEEN GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION. THEN IT'S CANDIDATES FAIL TO GET THE 2% OF THE VOTE FOR STATEWIDE RACES WITHOUT POINT THIS NEW PARTY WOULD LOSE ITS BALLOT STATUS. THE GREEN PARTY. HAS OFFERED IT'S SUPPORT EIGHTY FOUR FOUR SIX AMENDED TO LOWER THE FILING SEASON THE SIGNATURES IN LIEU OF THE FUNDING FEE. AND TO LOWER THE COST FOUR STATE AND COUNTY VOTER INFORMATION GUIDES WE AGREE ACCEPT OUR PROPOSALS ARE TO ELIMINATE. FILING SEASON SIGNATURES A LITTLE POLICIES ENTIRELY BECAUSE THEY ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL HER LIVING VERSUS SPANISH. AND REMOVE THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS THE WORD SHE TO HAVE A STATEMENT ON THE OFFICIAL VOTERS THAT PROMOTION GUIDE IS THE RESULT OF A POISON PILL AND- PROPOSITION THIRTY FOUR. BEFORE TWO THOUSAND THERE IS NO CHARGE FOR THE STATEMENTS. WE RECOMMEND THE FATHER WORKED WITH THE- BODIES AND- HAVE IN THE BILL APPROPRIATELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT WE HAVE MIKE FEINSTEIN WITH THE GREEN PARTY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH HAS A SUPPORT IF AMENDED- BOAT BUT WERE- ARE ARE. BEING TREATED AS A SECOND OPPOSITION WHEN THIS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR CURRENT WITNESSES SAY OF TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU DEAR CHAIR BERMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHAEL FEINSTEIN I'M A CO FOUNDER OF THE GREEN PARTY OF CALIFORNIA. A FORMER MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBER IN SANTA MONICA AND A TWENTY EIGHTEEN CANDIDATE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. THE GREEN PARTY THE LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO COUNTY SUPPORT EIGHTY FOUR FORTY SIX WITH AMENDMENTS. WE APPLIED ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES IN ITS EFFORT TO PROVIDE A MORE REASONABLE PETITION SIGNATURE OUT TO QUALIFY FOR STATE PARTY BALLOT STATUS. AT THE EXISTING THRESHOLD IS AMONG THE MOST ONEROUS IN THE NATION. THIS IS A PRIMARY REASON WE SUPPORT EIGHTY FOUR FORTY SIX. IRONICALLY AT THE SAME TIME YOU CAN BE EASIER FOR PARTIES TO QUALIFY FOR BALLOT STATUS. IT WILL REMAIN VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO RUN CANDIDATES. TOP TWO ELECTION REQUIREMENTS THAT MADE IT DE FACTO IMPOSSIBLE FOR SMALLER PARTY CANDIDATES TO ADVANCE TO THE GENERAL ELECTION EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO EVEN APPEAR ON THE PRIMARY. BEFORE TALK TO CALIFORNIA'S FOR LEGACY SMALLER PARTIES EVERY TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN CANDIDATES. AND EACH PRIMARY BALLOT EVER SINCE ONLY THIRTY NINE OF THEIR CANDIDATES IN TOTAL HAVE QUALIFIED EIGHT ELECTION MAKING CALIFORNIA A MULTI PARTY DEMOCRACY IN NAME ONLY. THAT'S WHY AB FOR FORTY SIX SHOULD BE AMENDED TO SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER OUR STATE OUT OF DATE FOR FILING TO BE A SIGNATURE IN THE THRESHOLD. THAT WAS CREATED WHEN WAS MOSTLY ONLY MAJOR PARTIES ON THE BALLOT. BEFORE TWENTY OH TO VOTER CANDIDATE A VOTER GUIDE CANDID STATEMENTS WERE FREE SINCE THEN THEY HAVE BEEN RAISED TO A PER CAPITA COSTS. FOR THE SAME CANDIDATES MANY VOTERS RECEIVE ALMOST NO INFORMATION ABOUT MANY OF THE CHOICES BEFORE THEM FOR THAT REASON AB FOUR FORTY SIX SHOULD BE AMENDED TO MAKE THAT CAUGHT THE MINIMUS. GREEN SUPPORT A FULL RANGE OF PARTIES ON THE BALLOT THAT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS WITHIN CALIFORNIA. AND ELECTORAL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THEM ALL THE RUN PUNITIVE. AND WIND SPEEDS IN PROPORTION TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULAR VOTE. THAT IS THE REASON YOU. SHOULD CONVENE A DEEP PUBLIC CRY THE TO REVIEW THE TOP TWO X. AND ALL. TO IT INCLUDING PER EVAN. OUT OF THE MONEY YEAR. AND RANCHO VOTING FOR SINGLE THE BIG WHITE ARE. THANK THANK VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB AT FOUR FORTY SIX. AS A REMINDER DUE TO TIME LIMITATIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY THE PUBLIC WALK FIFTEEN MINUTES IN TOTAL TIME FOR ADDITIONAL PUBLICCOMMENT. ALL ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARE LIMITED TO PROVIDING THEIR NAMES THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY REPRESENT AND THE POSITION ON THE BILL. IF ANY. OUR WHATEVER YOU GET IT. WE WILL START HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO PROVIDE THEIR POSITION ON AB FOR FORTY SIX. C. NINE. WILL KICK IT OVER TO REMOTE TO TESTIMONY STATION ANYBODY. SAYING NONE. WE WILL NOW OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WHICH PROVIDE THE POSITION ON EIGHTY FOUR FORTY SIX. MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ON THE LINE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK EITHER IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION. THEY BEFORE. FORTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR COMMENT IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO A. B. FOUR FOUR SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE AT THE END OF THE ROW. THAT COMMAND AGAIN ONE SEVEN ZERO. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO COMMENT COMING THROUGH AT THE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING BACK A COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR MOTIONS ARE SECONDS I DON'T RECALL VIA MOTION OR SECOND EARLIER. STILL LOOKING FOR MOTION OR SECOND OR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. NOT SEEING ANY OF THAT- WE'VE GOT A MOTION WE HAVE A SECOND MISTER MAYES WE LIKE TO CLOSE. SURE THIS IS A INTERESTING CONVERSATION DID HAVE A LITTLE DIALOGUE EARLIER WITH ONE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON IT- YOU KNOW I AS- AS IT'S WIDELY KNOWN- I GAVE UP MY- PARTY REGISTRATION- AND I AM AN INDEPENDENT BUT IF I AM COMPLETELY HONEST AND TRANSPARENT- IF IT WAS UP TO ME- I WOULD DO AWAY WITH OUR PARTIES. ALTOGETHER I AM NOT SO FOOLISH AS TO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS- IS GOING TO HAPPEN- A BUT- AS THE FORMER REPUBLICAN LEADER IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WHO SOMEBODY HAD TO WORK WITHIN THE PARTY AT THE PARTY SYSTEM- I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE. INCREDIBLE ADVANTAGES- TO HAVING THEM A POLITICAL PARTY I AND FOR CANDIDATES WHO ARE NOT OUT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE TWO ARE EVEN INVOLVED WITH ONE OF THE OTHERS IT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT. I TO BE ABLE TO- TO HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS. A CALIFORNIA BACK TO VERY PROUD THAT WE DO HAVE A THE OPEN PRIMARY- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT ALSO HAVE A RANK CHOICE VOTING WE HAVE. DONE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT SO TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW FOR A MORE DEMOCRACY IN THE STATE OF THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU TODAY- IS- IS GOES UP ALONG THAT SAME LINE JUST ALLOWED A LITTLE EASIER. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE- OTHER MOVEMENTS- TO BE ABLE TO GET STARTED BUT IT'S STILL A VERY VERY HIGH THRESHOLD- HOWEVER- IT IS- GOES A LONG WAY TOWARDS ALLOWING A FOR NEW MOVEMENTS TO BE ABLE TO START SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALL OF YOUR- A YOUR HELP ON THIS- AND THE COMMITTEE'S WORK. AND I WOULD APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU GUYS THIS IS FILLED WITH FORD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MASON I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH ME AND COMMITTEE STAFF ON AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL I APPRECIATE THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU BRING ON THIS ISSUE GIVEN THAT YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON TO BE ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. WITH NEITHER A DEMOCRAT NOR A REPUBLICAN WHEN APPEARING ON THE BALLOT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE DETAILED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR. WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY. PLEASE CALL THE VOTE. THE IS TO PAY. A SOME. AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE APPROACH. BERMAN HI. BERMAN I SAY ARE TôI FAIR TRIAL I'D DONE IT. BENNETT IS NOT VOTING LOW. HELLO I MAYES. MAYES AYE MULLIN MULLIN AYE BLANCA RUBIO I WANT TO REVEAL ON. THAT BILL IS OUT ON A SIX ZERO VOTE IF I HAVE MY MATH CORRECT I DO I'M NOT GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO THE MESSAGE YOU HAVE THE SCRIPT EVERYTHING I DO I'M PERMITTED TO GO ON A ROLL AND ALL THAT. STUFF BUT DO IT. ALL RIGHT THE NEXT ITEM ON THE IS AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE I SIMPLY MEMBER BERMAN AS SOON AS YOU GET DOWN OF THE PODIUM YOU'RE READY TO GO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES OF. ONE COMELEC HARRIS RESIGNED HER U. S. SENATE SEAT IN ADVANCE OF BEING SWORN IN AS VICE PRESIDENT IN JANUARY. IT CREATED A VACANCY IN CALIFORNIA'S REPRESENTATION IN THE U. S. SENATE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS. THAT VACANCY IN THE SUBSEQUENT APPOINTMENT OF THEN SECRETARY OF STATE ALEX PADILLA TO THE U. S. SENATE. PROMPTED A RE EXAMINATION OF CALIFORNIA'S LAWS GOVERNING THE FILLING OF THE U. S. SENATE VACANCIES. BECAUSE SENATOR PER DEAL WAS APPOINTED TO A TERM THAT ENDS ON JANUARY THIRD FOLLOWING THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED STATEWIDE. GENERAL ELECTION. EXISTING STATE LAW ALLOWS HIM TO REMAIN IN OFFICE UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THAT TERM. ON JANUARY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AS A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT HOWVER. TO FEDERAL APPELLATE COURT OPINIONS ISSUED SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THAT ASPECT OF STATE LAW COMPLIES WITH THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT. TO THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. ADDITIONALLY STATE LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE A WORKABLE SITUATION FOR FILLING U. S. SENATE VACANCIES. IN OTHER SITUATIONS FOR EXAMPLE STATE LAW APPEARS TO REQUIRE. THAT ELECTION BE HELD TO FILL A VACANCY AT A STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION. EVEN IF THE VACANCY OCCURS THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. MAYBE FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA LAW IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SEVENTY THE MOMENT. BY PROVIDING FOR AN ELECTION TO BE HELD TO FILL A VACANCY IN CALIFORNIA'S. REPRESENTATION IN THE U. S. SENATE. EVEN IF THE VACANCY OCCURS DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE U. S. SENATE TERM. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE GREATEST PARTICIPATION IN THOSE ELECTIONS. AND TO AVOID THE COSTS AND DISRUPTIONS OF STANDALONE STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTIONS WHENEVER POSSIBLE. AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE GENERALLY REQUIRES U. S. SENATE VACANCY ELECTIONS. TO BE CONSOLIDATED WITH REGULARLY SCHEDULED. STATEWIDE ELECTIONS. WHERE THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THIS BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES A PROCEDURE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO SCHEDULE A STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTION. TO FILL THE VACANCY IF IT IS THE PRACTICAL IF IT IS PRACTICAL TO DO SO. BEFORE THE END OF THE TERM. IF YOU FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AND S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA AND HAS NO OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. THANK YOU MA'AM.
