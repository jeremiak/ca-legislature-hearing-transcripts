00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.667
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THE MINIMUM

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:59.303
STANDARD BE MORE THAN ONE TERM.

00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:03.073

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:36.640
KNOW I'VE ACTUALLY FEEL EVEN

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:38.442
BETTER ABOUT THE BILL IF IT WAS

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:40.444
THREE TERMS. BECAUSE I THINK

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.712
TWELVE YEARS IS WHAT THE STATE

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:44.114
LEGISLATURES IMPOSED ON ITSELF.

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:46.817
OUR HAS IMPOSED ON THAT I'VE

00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:48.652
ACTUALLY SERVE IN A COUNTY THAT

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:51.621
HAS A TWELVE YEAR LIMIT. AND

00:49:51.688 --> 00:49:53.657
TWELVE YEARS IS LONG ENOUGH

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:54.858
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:56.326
COMING IN A SUPERVISORS

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:57.394
IMMEDIATELY TRYING TO FIGURE

00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:59.162
OUT WHAT THEIR NEXT STEP IS.

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:01.565
AND I THINK WHEN YOU GO BELOW

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.100
THAT YOU HAVE THAT AS A PROBLEM

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:05.335
SO. IF AS THIS BILL MOVES

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:09.740
FORWARD YOU- WANTED TO- AMENDED

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:10.574
TO TWELVE YEARS I CERTAINLY

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.175
WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:13.443
BUT I'M ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.512
EFFORT IF THAT'S WHAT IF THAT'S

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:16.780
IF THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO GET

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:17.981
THROUGH. BECAUSE IT'S FAR

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:20.283
BETTER THAN WHERE WE ARE RIGHT

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:20.851
NOW WHERE THEY COULD TAKE IT

00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:22.853
DOWN TO ONE. THING AGAIN IF

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:29.159
THANK YOU. WILL MISSOURI. I

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:30.293

KNOW I AM HUGE OF TERM LIMITS-

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:37.334
BUT WITH THE REASON- I WOULD

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:38.602
NOT HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:40.871
BE HERE IF. IF IT WERE NOT FOR

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.472
TERM LIMITS BUT PRIOR TO MY

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:43.673
COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE THERE

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.742
WAS A SIX YEAR TERM LIMIT TO.

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:46.877
THE ASSEMBLY AND THE WAY I

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:48.178
DESCRIBE IT WAS THE FIRST TWO

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:48.879
YEARS YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:50.447
OUT WHERE THE BATHROOM IS THE

00:50:50.514 --> 00:50:51.381
SECOND TWO YEARS YOU ACTUALLY

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:52.249
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING ABOUT

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:53.450
THE LAST TWO YEARS FOLKS WERE

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:54.484
ALREADY BUSY TRYING TO RUN FOR

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:55.986
SOMETHING ELSE. AND SO WAS THAT

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:57.421
THE SERVICE FOR THE STATE TO

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:59.389
ONLY HAVE TWO GOOD YEARS OUT OF

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.792
A MEMBER NOW THAT WE HAVE

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:03.260
TWELVE YEARS. WE FIGURED OUT

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:04.261
WHERE THE BATHROOM IS THAT NOW

00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:05.829
YOU HAVE A SOLID AMOUNT OF

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:07.464
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE I THINK

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:09.299
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE STATE

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:09.900
AND I THINK IT'S HAPPENING AND

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:11.868
&lt;c.magenta&gt;OCAL GOVERNMENTS IS. THAT THE&lt;/c&gt;

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:13.236
ACTUAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE

00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:15.038
NOT RUNNING THE STATE I AM THE

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:16.039
ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE NOT

00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:17.441
RUNNING THE CITY SAID STAFF

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:18.642
THAT'S RUNNING THE CITIES. AND

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:20.143
SO WE GET INTO A SITUATION

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.013
WHERE WHERE IT DOESN'T MATTER-

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:25.182

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:34.157
EIGHT YEARS WHERE FOLKS ARE

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:37.360
GOING TO GET EXACTLY YOU KNOW

00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:39.496

THAT THAT HAS THAT

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:42.966
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND AT

THE- THE EDUCATION THAT WE GET.

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:08.391
IN THAT TIME IT'S VERY

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:09.693
IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:52:09.759 --> 00:52:10.827

THE- SAKE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT I

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:32.415
THINK HAVING SOME. LIMITS IS

00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:35.051
IMPORTANT- BUT UP FOR FOUR

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:36.152

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:37.988

SENATE. BUT JUST BECAUSE IT

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.232
MOVES ACROSS THE OTHER HOUSE

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.233

00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:15.859
A GOVERNMENT RUN BY THE RICH.

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:16.726

FOR YOUR YOUR BILL HERE- DOES

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:19.721
IT LIMIT THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:22.123
POLITICAL PARTIES. THE BILL AS

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.358
IN PRINT TODAY DOES NOT LIMIT

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:24.793
POLITICAL PARTY CONTRIBUTIONS

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:26.561
AS POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:27.629
THOUGH I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.030
THAT IF THE COMMITTEE WHEN I

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:31.132
BECAUSE THE POLITICAL PARTIES

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:33.368
THEMSELVES ARE NOT LIMITED IN

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:34.269
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY CAN

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:37.172
CONTRIBUTE. TO A OR SPEND ON A

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:40.508
CAMPAñA INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATE.

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:42.811
SO ESSENTIALLY BY ELIMINATING

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:44.112
THIS TO THE INDIVIDUAL

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:46.114
CANDIDATES THEY JUST GIVE IT TO

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:46.915
THE POLITICAL PARTY THE

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:48.349
POLITICAL PARTY CAN SPEND A

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:49.317
MILLION DOLLARS ON ONE

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:52.120
CANDIDATE THAT THEY CHOOSE WALL

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:54.088
THE OTHER CANDIDATE IS LEFT IS.

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:55.890
THIS GREAT FOR WHATEVER YOU CAN

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:58.426
DO ON HIS OWN MONEY OR WHATEVER

01:24:58.493 --> 01:24:59.894
THAT POLITICAL PARTY CAN SPEND

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:01.696
ON IT SO THAT CREATES THAT SAME

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:03.164
IMBALANCE THAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:05.166
ABOUT- WITH THIS GRANT THAT'S

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:06.634
CORRECT AND IF- IF I MAY

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:08.603
MISTER. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:09.938
AMEND THE BILL TO INCLUDE TO

01:25:10.004 --> 01:25:11.372
MAKE IT VERY EXPLICIT BECAUSE

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:12.340
RIGHT NOW AS OUR FEDERAL

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:13.341
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES IN

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:14.476
CAN'T TAKE DIRECT CORPORATE

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:16.044
CONTRIBUTIONS THE PARTY CAN

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:17.979
ALSO GO AHEAD. OF ME DIRECTLY

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:21.149
AND YOU KNOW THE REST OF IT

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:22.183
IT'S A- THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.853
TRYING TO. LEVEL ARE YOU ARE

01:25:24.919 --> 01:25:26.120
YOU YOU'RE TRYING TO LIKE LEVEL

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:28.122
THE PLAYING FIELD. BUT YOU HAVE

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.023
TO LEVEL IT FOR EVERYBODY AT

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:30.825
THE SAME TIME. OTHERWISE IT'S

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:33.495
NOT EVER GOING TO BE LEVEL. AND

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:34.562
THAT'S THE ISSUE I HAVE WITH

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:35.830
THESE ATTEMPTS I HAVE

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:38.800
ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUE WITH TRYING

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:39.367
TO GET ALL THAT OUT HERE I'D

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:42.136
LOVE IT. BUT IT IT YOU KNOW A

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.271
GREAT CREATES AN IMBALANCE NO

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:44.506
MATTER WHAT YOU DO UNLESS YOU

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:46.541
DO THE WHOLE THING. AND- SO

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:48.676
THIS IS ONLY A PIECE OF IT. AND

01:25:48.743 --> 01:25:50.378
WE CAN'T DO ONE PIECE AT A TIME

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:52.113
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAT THAT

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.582
CONTINUES. AND I MEAN YOU DAY

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.851
IMBALANCE CONTINUES- SO YOU

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:58.353
KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU- MONEY

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.154
NEED TO BE OUT. BUT NO MATTER

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:02.490
WHAT YOU DO IN IN THE POLITICAL

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:05.860
ARENA- WERE STILL THERE. YOU'RE

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.562
STILL GONNA HAVE SOME INFLUENCE

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:10.098
ON YOU AND- ADD TO THE EXTENT

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:12.066
THAT. THIS IS YOUR ONLY INCOME

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:14.168
THIS COULD BE. THAT COULD BE A

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:16.237
DETERMINING FACTOR IN WHETHER

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:17.071
YOU'RE SUPPORTING SOMETHING OR

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:19.073
NOT. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S IT

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.341
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:22.377
THAT INFLUENCE YOU AND- THE

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:24.479
SUGGESTION BY A BY SOME WHO'VE

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:27.048
CALLED AND THAT. WERE FOR SALE

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:28.416
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:30.285
BEEN PEOPLE FOR SALE BEFORE.

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:32.086
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MOST

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:33.054
OF THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE DEALT

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:35.290
WITH. I'M HERE OR NOT. THEY'RE

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:36.391
HERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GOOD

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:37.792
HARD THEY WANT TO DO WHAT'S

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.261
GOOD FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.263
SO THAT TO ME DOESN'T PLAY INTO

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.899
IT AS MUCH AS- THIS IS THIS

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.668
IMBALANCE THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:48.436
AND- YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID I

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:49.837

AND THAT OF. A JUST THE WEALTHY

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:50.571
SERVING IN GOVERNMENT I THINK

YOU BRING ME SOME TYPE OF

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:52.173

MANY SAFEGUARDS AS WE NEED AND

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:01.929
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A SERIOUS

01:40:01.995 --> 01:40:03.464
PROBLEM I'VE FOUGHT TO DECREASE

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:04.898
THE INFLUENCE OF BIG MONEY IN

01:40:04.965 --> 01:40:06.033
POLITICS FOR THE LAST TWENTY

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:08.469
FIVE YEARS. I'M PROUD THAT- IN

01:40:08.535 --> 01:40:09.670
MANY OF MY CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:13.340
ABLE TO VOLUNTARILY LIMIT MY-

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:15.976

OF IN TERMS OF NOT TAKING

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:25.152
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PEOPLE THAT

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:26.487
WOULD HAVE UNDUE INFLUENCE AS A

01:40:26.553 --> 01:40:27.955
RESULT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS.

01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:34.895
DEVELOPERS OF. ECCENTRIC CENTER

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:35.462
PEOPLE HAVE TO ANYBODY HAD A

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:36.063
CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY- ALL

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:37.331
OF THE KIND OF. AND I'VE- AND

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:39.333
ONE A DAY. OF SIX. CAMP FINANCE

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.136
REFORM LAWS. INCLUDING WHAT IS

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:44.138
WIDELY LABELED AS TO TOUGHEST

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:46.106
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS.

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:48.041
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:51.345
COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS- AND-

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:53.547
I'VE LEARNED THAT. IN DOING ALL

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:56.683
OF THAT AND WRITING THOSE LAWS-

01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:59.219
OF. THAT THERE ARE CONSTANT

01:40:59.286 --> 01:41:00.487
BATTLES AND PUSH BACK AND

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:03.991
LEGAL- LOOPHOLES THAT PEOPLE

01:41:04.057 --> 01:41:05.159
USE TO TRY TO GET AROUND THOSE

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:07.161
LAWS. SO I'VE LEARNED A REFORM

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:08.495
IN THIS FIELD IS VERY

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:09.730
CHALLENGING TO MAKE

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:11.231
PARTICULARLY GOOD REFORM THAT

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:12.666
THAT DISTRACTS PEOPLE'S FAIR

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:14.701
CENTER. AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:16.637
THAT WHEN WE LAUNCH REFORM

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:19.740
EFFORT. BOTH EXACTLY WHAT WE DO

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:22.643
AND HOW WE DO IT. IS ABSOLUTELY

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.511
CRITICAL TO OUR ABILITY IN THE

01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:26.380
LONG RUN TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN

01:41:26.447 --> 01:41:28.515
OUR EFFORTS. TO WIN CAMPAIGN

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:30.584
REFORM THAT DECREASES THE

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:31.318
INFLUENCE OF BIG MONEY IN

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:33.220
POLITICS. IF WE DON'T DO IT

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:34.955
PROPERLY IN OUR EFFORTS WE

01:41:35.022 --> 01:41:36.657
ACTUALLY SET OURSELVES

01:41:36.723 --> 01:41:39.760
BACKWARDS IN THE EFFORT- I

01:41:39.827 --> 01:41:42.496
HIGHLIGHT MR LOS MOVE. DECISION

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:43.831
NOT TO RUN SOMETHING THIS YEAR

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:45.399
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO TRY TO

01:41:45.466 --> 01:41:46.600
TAKE THE TIME TO HAVE TO GET

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.368
SOMETHING. SO FOR SOME OF THE

01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:49.970
IMPLICATION OF NOT CHECKING

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:51.505
THIS MOTION TODAY AND I WON'T

01:41:51.572 --> 01:41:54.208
BE SECOND. IMPLIES A SUPPORT OF

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:56.543
BIG MONEY IN POLITICS- NOTHING

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:57.411
COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH

01:41:57.478 --> 01:41:59.346
FOR ME- IT'S CERTAINLY NOT MY

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:01.148
POSITION OR MY LONG TERM GOALS

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:02.950
REMEMBER THIS ASSEMBLY. BUT

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:11.458
WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT IS

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:12.125
SOMETHING I FEEL IS

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:14.027
APPROPRIATE. THE WITH THAT

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:43.410
THIS IS ALSO VERY MISLEADING.

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:43.944
AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:46.380
CLEARLY STATES FEDERAL LAW AND

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:47.648
THE LAW AND THE VAST MAJORITY

01:44:47.714 --> 01:44:49.216
OF THOSE TWENTY TWO STATES IS

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:50.984
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN

01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:53.387
WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. THE TERM

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:55.622
YOU USE BUSINESS ENTITY. IS

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:57.090
MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE

01:44:57.157 --> 01:44:58.892
DEFINITION F CORPORATION THAT

01:44:58.959 --> 01:44:59.826
IS USED BY THE FEDERAL

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:01.094
GOVERNMENT AND THE OTHER STATES

01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:02.062
AND YOU ALLUDED TO.

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.664
CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS BUT BUT

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:06.033
CLEARLY IF THOSE DEFINITIONS

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:06.533
ARE USED BY THE FEDERAL

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.602
GOVERNMENT AND THE OTHER STATES

01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:09.136
THOSE ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY

01:45:09.202 --> 01:45:11.672
SOUND. USING THE TERM BUSINESS

01:45:11.738 --> 01:45:12.739
ENTITY IS YOUR BILL DOES

01:45:12.806 --> 01:45:15.275
CREATES LOOPHOLES SO BIG YOU

01:45:15.342 --> 01:45:15.842
COULD DRIVE AN ARMORED TRUCK

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:18.178
THROUGH THEM. THERE ARE ALSO

01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:19.980
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS EXPRESSED

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:21.048
BY CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:22.215
ELECTION LAW EXPERTS LIKE

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:23.917
JESSICA LEVINSON FROM THE GET

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:25.886
THE OIL LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL. THAT

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:28.422
AB TWENTY WON'T ACTUALLY REDUCE

01:45:28.488 --> 01:45:28.922
THE AMOUNT OF CORPORATE

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:30.290
SPENDING AND POLITICS. WE'LL

01:45:30.357 --> 01:45:31.892
JUST SHIP THAT SPENDING TO LESS

01:45:31.958 --> 01:45:32.826
TRANSPARENT AND LESS

01:45:32.893 --> 01:45:34.061
ACCOUNTABLE ROUTES LIKE

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:36.697
<u>&lt;c.red&gt;NDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES. THAT&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:45:36.763 --> 01:45:38.699
IS NOT PROGRESS. WHEN WE SPOKE

01:45:38.765 --> 01:45:40.300

OBJECTIVELY IN THE BRAND SCOPE

01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:53.940
OF MONEY IS RELATIVELY SMALL

01:46:54.007 --> 01:46:55.675
BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR OPTIONS
