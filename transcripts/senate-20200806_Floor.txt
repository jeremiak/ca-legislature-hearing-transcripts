SENATE BILL FOR TWENTY THREE BY SENATOR UMBERG AND ACTUALLY IN TWO ELECTIONS AND DECLARING THE URGENCY PARASITIC EFFECT MEDIALLY SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- THIS NOVEMBER WILL HAVE THE MOST ON YOU LECTURE AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME. BUT THERE WILL BE AN ELECTION. AND IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THERE'S AS MUCH ACCESS AS POSSIBLE WE BRING YOU SB FOUR TWENTY THREE- EVERY REGISTERED VOTER WHO'S ACTIVE IN CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THE MAIL. BY PROVIDING IT. THE PERSON. WE AMENDED SB FOUR TWENTY THREE IN THE ASSEMBLY GUARANTEE THEY'LL BE ACCESSIBLE SECURE AND SAFE IN PERSON OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTERS WHO CANNOT. OR CHOOSE NOT TO USE THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT FOR FOUR FOUR FULL DAYS STARTING THE SATURDAY PRIOR TO THE ELECTION. SB FOUR TWENTY THREE WILL REQUIRE NUMEROUS CONVENIENT LOCATIONS FOR VOTERS TO SIMPLY WAIT TO DROP OFF THEIR BALLOTS AS WELL AS A STATEWIDE VOTER EDUCATION. AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. UP THERE WILL BE A NECESSITY FOR IN PERSON VOTING LOCATIONS BECAUSE SOME FOLKS LOSE THEIR BALLOTS. SOME FOLKS- THE BALLOTS ARE DESTROYED IN SOME FASHION. OR THEY MAY NEED ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF SOME PERSONAL CHALLENGE- THE COUNTIES HAVE AN OPTION TO. OPT IN OR NOT OFTEN THEY CAN CONDUCT THE ELECTION AS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST BUT NEVERTHELESS EVERY REGISTERED ACTIVE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO RECEIVE A BALLOT- THIS IS A MEASURE ENSURES THAT IS MANY MORE QUALIFIED TO VOTE. CAN VOTE CAL VIRGIN ISLANDS. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE ITEM DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MATTER PRESIDENT- JUST A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR PLEASE WOULD YOU TAKE A QUESTION SENATOR ON BERKSHIRE HAPPY TO I'VE I'VE- FOR TEN DAYS OVER THREE SO I GUESS I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS YOU'D MENTIONED THAT IT WOULD BE AN OPT IN FOR EACH OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. SO CERTAIN COUNTIES COULD STILL STAY AT TEN DAYS. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. QUESTION TO THE LOGIC FOR REDUCING IT TO THREE DAYS SO- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YES COUNTIES CAN OPT IN OF A COUNTY REGISTER WHICH IS THEY HAVE A POLLING PLACE OPEN FOR LONGER THAN FOUR DAYS THEY CAN DO SO- THE LOCK IS. IT IS IT IS A COMPROMISE IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IS GOING TO GET A MAIL IN BALLOT EVERYONE IS ACTIVE REGISTERED IT'S GOING TO GET IT ELLEN BACK- WE SAW IN THE LAST ELECTION THE VOTING CENTERS ARE FOR TEN OR ELEVEN DAYS DID NOT SEE AS MUCH ACTIVITY. IS ANTICIPATED. BUT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT. THE SATURDAY TILL TWO. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY THIS BILL. REQUIRES A BOATSWAIN'S BE OPEN FOR AT LEAST FOUR DAYS.
