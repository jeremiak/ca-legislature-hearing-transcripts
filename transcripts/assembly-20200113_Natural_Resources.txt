TWENTY HEARING OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE AND IT WITH THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM ARE GOING TO BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE. AND THEN VOTE ON BILLS WHEN WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE BILLS IN SIGNED IN ORDER AND THEN WE WILL HAVE ONE BILL THAT'S PROPOSED PROPOSED CONSENT AB TEN SEVENTY ONE. OUR FIRST UP IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON WITH A. B. NINETEEN. WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OUR FIRST OFF I JUST WANT TO START OFF I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. AB NINETEEN AS IN PRINT WITH ESTABLISH A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP-COUNTY ROAD MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICTS. PURCHASE VEGETATION ANAGEMENT EQUIPMENT TO PREVENT WILDFIRES ALONG COUNTY MAINTAIN STREETS AND ROADS ITH IN HIGH AND VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY SONGS. ACCORDING TO THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO NEARLY 25% OF WILDFIRES. IN THE COUNTY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WERE VEHICLE RELATED FIRES. THE MOST NOTABLE VEHICLE RELATED FIRE THE CAR FIRE BURN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES DESTROYED MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED STRUCTURES AND KILLED AT LEAST SEVEN PEOPLE. VEHICLE FIRES CAN BE CAUSED BY AN ENGINE CATCHING FIRE BECAUSE IT'S PULLING MAINTAIN A FAILING CATALYTIC CONVERTER A FLAT TIRE OR SOMEONE DRAGGING A METAL CHAIN OR EVEN PULLING OVER JUST SIMPLY TO PULL OVER TO MAKE A PHONE CALL IN A BRUSHY AREA ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AND IGNITING DRY GRASS BY FOCUSING ON THE FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE ALONG COUNTY MAINTAIN ROADWAYS AB NINETEEN IS INTENDED TO HELP PREVENT NEARLY ONE QUARTER OF ALL WILDFIRES. THIS GRANT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT TO LOCAL WORLD DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICTS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO MANAGE VEGETATION ALONG COUNTY STREETS AND ROADS. THE AMENDMENTS THAT I'M ACCEPTING TODAY WILL APPROPRIATE TWENTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM. AND REQUIRE THOSE FUNDS TO BE FOCUS OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT EQUIPMENT AND FUEL REDUCTION ALONG ROADWAYS I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S DESIRE TO NOT CREATE DUPLICATIVE GRANT PROGRAMS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. TOWARD ENSURING THAT THE FUNDS ALLOCATED IN THIS BILL OR DISPENSED IN A TARGETED MANNER TO THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE GREATEST NEED- THIS BILL- ENJOYS SUPPORT FROM MANY MANY FIRE DISTRICTS. AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION THE CITY OF SAN MARCOS SAN DIEGO COUNTY FIRE TO SIX ASSOCIATION CAL FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION- AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON- I HAVE WITH ME TODAY FIRE CHIEF STEVEN AB FROM THE NORTH COUNTY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT. AT AND STACY HEATON FROM RC RC AS WITNESSES TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY WITNESS WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU MY NAME IS STEVE ABBOTT PARK CHIEF MECHANIC FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT SO VERY BRIEFLY- IN MY THIRTY YEAR TENURE NOW WITH OUR COUNTY FIRE WE'VE EXPERIENCED THREE CATASTROPHIC FIRES THAT'S THREE TOO MANY THANKFULLY UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER- FIRES THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON MENTIONED- WE DID NOT HAVE. ANY FATALITIES. HOWEVER AT ROADSIDE CLEARANCE IN ADDITION TO ALL THE FACTORS THAT SHE MENTIONED ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE- PROBABILITY OF SURVIVING ESCAPING A WILDFIRE AYE TAKING FOR EXAMPLE THE CEDAR FIRE THAT HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE- ONE OF THE STATE'S DEADLIEST FIRES AT THIRTEEN FATALE THESE VIRTUALLY ALL THOSE BRUTALITIES WERE A RESULT OF- DE. DEATH ALONG THE ROADWAYS WHAT WHILE ATTEMPTING TO FLEE THE FIRE. I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE THOUGHT IS- YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY OF A PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS- AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT SEVEN WERE BUYING. EQUIPMENT AND NOT AS WE'RE NOT PREDOMINATELY FUNDING SERVICES WITH THIS AND SO THAT'S GIVING THE FIRE AGENCIES IN THE COUNTY. I ROAD APARTMENTS IS RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GET THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS UP AND RUNNING. TO USE OR CASE IN POINT- ARE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE 90% OF OUR DISTRICT A STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. IT TOOK A COUNTY ROAD DEPARTMENT UNTIL- THE MONTH OF OCTOBER WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR MONTHS TOO LATE TO CLEAR THE ROADS WITHIN OUR- WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION. AND THAT'S THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN IN TALKING WITH THE ROAD SUPERVISOR THEY INDICATED- YOU KNOW- CHIEF IT. IF WE COULD RENT THE EQUIPMENT WE WOULD RENT IT SO WE CAN GET THIS WORK DONE BUT THERE IS SIMPLY NOT AND TO BE HAPPY. AND THAT TO ME WAS THE LIGHT BULBS THAT TO A BOY WE REALLY NEED A PROGRAM. LIKE THIS AND ALONG COMES. SENATE MEMBER WALDRON FOR THIS IS A WONDERFUL. OKAY REQUEST. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M STACY HEAT WITH THE WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE AT SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND YOU KNOW THE CAR FIRE WAS ACTUALLY IN ONE OF OUR MEMBER COUNTY SHASTA COUNTY AND IT PRETTY WELL DESTROYED THE CITY READING AS YOU WELL KNOW. AND IN MANY OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES THAT COULD USE THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN PURCHASE EQUIPMENT TO GO OUT AND DO CLEARANCES AROUND THE ROADS TO PREVENT SUCH FIRES LIKE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF AREAS OF YOU KNOW- SOCIAL ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT COULD REALLY USE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS TELL PURCHASE EQUIPMENT TO MAINTAINING TO KEEP THAT SUSTAINABLE AS CHIEF ABBOTT SAID. AND THIS PROGRAM COULD BE OF GREAT USE AMONG A LOT OF OR MEMBER COUNTIES AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY WE THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING UP BEFORE YOU.

THERE'S VERY FEW THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEVASTATION OF WILDFIRES IN DEALING WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. IT'S KIND OF IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS AND IT'S STARTING TO GROW THE- SOME STEAM BEHIND IT AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY. WHAT WE CAN DO TO TAKE THE INTENSITY OF THESE FIRES THAT OUR MEN AND WOMEN THAT THEY ARE CALLED TO GO FIGHT THEM GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH THESE THINGS BEFORE THEY GROW UP YOU KNOW WHERE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE WE THROW OUT UNTIL THE WEATHER COOPERATES AND SOME THINGS LIKE THAT. IT'S GOING TO GET OUT OF CONTROL SO I APPRECIATE YOU SOMEONE NUMBER BRING US FORWARD- LOOK FOR TO MOVING FORWARD. AND THE- LOVE THE SPORT.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES AND STAFF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB NINE SIXTY SIX I WANNA. FIRST SAY I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT- I'M PLEASED TO BUY THAT AB NINE SIX SIX SIX WHICH- WILL TAKE S. STEPS TO. MEASURE AND REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT CALIFORNIA CEMENT AND CONCRETE INDUSTRIES CEMENT. AND ITS RELATED PRODUCT CONCRETE ARE VITAL TO OUR CIVILIZATION AND USED IN VIRTUALLY EVERY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. BUT CEMENT PRODUCTION IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST ENERGY. AND CARBON INTENSIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESS SEES. IN THE WORLD ON ITS OWN THE GLOBAL CEMENT INDUSTRY ACCOUNTS FOR BETWEEN FIVE AND EIGHT PERCENT. OF THE WORLD'S HARMFUL CARBON EMISSIONS. CALIFORNIA'S EIGHT CEMENT MAN FACTORIES PRIMARILY USE COAL AND PETROLEUM COKE AS FUEL FOR THE COURT FOR THEIR OPERATIONS AND- CALIFORNIA'S CEMENT COMPANIES ARE THE LARGEST CONSUMERS OF COAL IN THE STATE. THANKS TO ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTION PROCESS SEES. THE CLEANEST CEMENT FACTORIES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY CUT POLLUTION AB NINE SIX SIX REQUIRE CEMENT MANUFACTURERS TO MEASURE AND REPORT. THEIR EMISSIONS USING THIRD PARTY VERIFIED DOCUMENTS CALLED ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS OR EP'S FOR SHORT. AND I BELIEVE IN THE NINE SIX SIX IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO ADDRESS. OUR EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE AS A GLOBAL LEADER ON CLIMATE ACTION CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE LEADING- AND THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE AB NINE SIXTY SIX. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE WITH ME. FIVE ONE IS HERE WITH ME CHRIS ERICKSON CEO OF BP SOFTWARE COMPANY CLIMATE. TRAFFIC AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES THANK YOU. I WANT TO START BY SAYING MY COMPANY HAS BEEN GENERATED DVDS- SINCE THEY WERE FIRST INTRODUCED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE NO GENERATED OVER TWENTY THOUSAND A PIECE IN THE MARKETPLACE- WHICH IN A SEA CHANGE IN THE ATTITUDE ABOUT HE PT'S IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN PARTICULAR- THEY WERE INITIALLY VIEWED AS SORT OF A GREEN TAX- BY THE INDUSTRY BUT MORE AND MORE THEY'RE BEING ACCEPTED NOW AS AN IMPORTANT NEW METRIC FOR THE GROWING. LOW CARBON CONSTRUCTION MARKET. AND I THINK THAT'S NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND BUT THE RULES HAVE CHANGED AND DEVELOPED THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE EIGHTY P. THESE ARE VERY VERY COMPARISON BETWEEN TEXAS. AND SECONDLY- EPT AUTOMATION IS DRIVING THE COST WAY WAY DOWN. ALL WITH RESPECT TO THE CEMENT INDUSTRY THEY'RE ALSO SEEING THIS CHANGE AND OF COURSE THERE ARE THE MAJOR PROVIDERS TO THE READY MIX COMPANIES AND MOST OF THEM ARE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED- IN THE PAST THEY'VE BEEN USING INDUSTRY AVERAGE GPD DATA. TO SUPPORT THERE'S CONCRETE PROVIDERS AND- THEY ARE NOW PENALIZED- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PRODUCE AN UNCERTAINTY METRIC OF PLUS OR MINUS 50% UP 250% WHEN THEY USE THIS INDUSTRY AVERAGE EPT- SO THAT THERE ARE NOW MOTIVATED TO MOVE TOWARDS FACILITY. SPECIFICALLY PRODUCE. AND LAST OF ALL THEY'RE ALSO MOTIVATED AT A MACRO LEVEL. THE LARGEST CEMENT PRODUCER IN THE WORLD WHICH IS HEIDELBERG CEMENT. HAS COMMITTED TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT BY 30% BY TWENTY THIRTY AND TO BE FULLY CARBON NEUTRAL. ARE BY TWENTY FIFTY SO OVERALL I SEE THIS BILL AND MY COMPANY SEES THIS BILL WAS VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH MARKET TRENDS AND THE TIMING IS JUST RIGHT. THANK YOU YOU KNOW THE WITNESS I DO I ALSO HAVE KEVIN PHILLIPS DIRECTOR OF THIS YEAR CLUB CALIFORNIA. HI THANK YOU- AND HAPPY NEW YEAR- WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- WE HAVE FOUND IN THE PAST ON OF THEIR AND A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT DISCLOSURE IS ONE OF THE- POWERFUL TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO ENCOURAGE- NOT JUST COMPANIES TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT BUT ALSO TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO. PURCHASE THOSE THINGS THAT ARE MOST BENEFICIAL AND THAT WILL REDUCE- IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT THIS GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY THIS BILL WILL GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE- STATE AGENCIES TO SEE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE FROM PURCHASING THESE PRODUCTS FROM DIFFERENT VENDORS. AND AGAIN IT WILL CERTAINLY SET UP A- COMPETITIVE VERGE BY THE VENDORS TO- REDUCE THEIR- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND OTHER POLLUTANTS. THINGS WERE STRONG SUPPORT IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. CHARLIE READ WITH A CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ASSOCIATION AND A BIG PART OF OUR MEMBERSHIP ARE CONCRETE PRODUCERS AND REALLY AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WE HAVE SUBMITTED A LETTER EXPLAINING SOME ISSUES- HOPE THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S OKAY TO MAYBE TAKE A FEW SECONDS TO. BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE SURE JUSTIN JUST KIND OF GENERAL BACKGROUND IS PROBABLY A HUNDRED CONCRETE COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PLANTS- DISPERSED FROM THE STATE AND ALL THE EFFORTS OF DEFINITELY BEGUN ARE SOME COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE YOU PT'S FOR ALL A PART OF THEIR PRODUCTION OTHERS ARE ARE PRODUCING THEM BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OUT THERE THAT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A- SORE CAN- ISSUES THAT WE WERE HOPING THAT CAN. BE ADDRESSED WE'VE HAD SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS OF THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE TOO BUT IT'S QUICKLY I THINK WANTED RECENT TIME FOR IMPLEMENTATION- TO CAN ADDRESS THE THRESHOLD. BILL I FIFTY YARDS OF CONCRETE THINK THAT MAYBE THE HIGHER. ALSO A THRESHOLD. SIZE OF PLANT THAT WOULD BE APPLICABLES TO- BEGIN FOR THE MORE RURAL SMALLER LOW VOLUME PLANTS LAW HARDER TO- DO ALL THIS. IN SORT THE COST- AND THIRD JUST- MAYBE SOMETHING THAT SOME SORT OF GUARANTEE THAT THE P. D. WOULD HAVE A- CERTAIN LIFE TO IT I. WE ASK FOR THAT BECAUSE THERE'S ALL THESE OTHER BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS THAT ARE PRODUCED NATIONALLY WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER. THEY ONLY LAST FOR FIVE YEARS SO DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU PRODUCE THREE P. D. YOU KNOW YOU MAY HAVE TO PRODUCE ANOTHER ONE. A YEAR LATER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THEN. ANOTHER WAY TO DRESS AT TWO IS ALSO PER. PER PROJECT AND YOU SOMETIMES A CALTRANS PROJECT FIRST THIS CAN GO ON FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS OR SO. THOSE ARE COMMENTS A DEAF. SHADE ALL THAT SESSION AND LOOK FORD MORTON FIFTY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ARE OPPOSITION. OKAY YES GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TOM SEATS WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA CEMENT ASSOCIATION I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE OVER THE PAST YEAR REGARDING THIS BILL AND- ESSENTIALLY WANT TO EXPRESS THE FACT THAT ARE RE INDUSTRY IS NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECORATIONS IN THEMSELVES ARE USEFUL FOR CAPTURING INFORMATION MUCH OF WHICH WE ALREADY SHARE WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WHO WE COLLABORATE WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS REGARDING EMISSIONS FROM CALIFORNIA'S CEMENT PRODUCERS BUT WE WOULD URGE OF THIS BILL TO INCLUDE SOME THINGS THAT COULD HELP US MAKE A DIFFERENCE THE SEARCH IS MEASURING EMISSIONS THINGS LIKE AYE INCENTIVIZING THE STATE TO USE PORTLAND LIMESTONE CEMENT AND BE ABOUT A 10% REDUCTION. WHICH IS ALREADY BEING USED IN IN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD FOR AS MANY AS FORTY YEARSALSO ON THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS THAT ARE CURRENTLY- RESTRICTED IN OUR STATE USED ELSEWHERE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HELPING US REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF THAT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS WILL AT SOME POINT. SHOW THE IMPACT REMAIN ABLE TO MAKE WITH THOSE CHANGES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH G. BODY ELSE. OKAY WITHOUT WILL GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY KIND. AND ONE DOES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO MISTER BONTA REGARDING THE REQUEST OF THE FIRST- WITNESS WHO CAME TO SPEAK AND- WHEN NOT IN OPPOSITION HE WAS NEUTRAL- IS THERE ANY.

REALLY BUT THIS MINISTRY IN THE CONCRETE INDUSTRY FOR THEIR COLLABORATION ON THERE GATE WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD MEETINGS WITH MATTER THE DISTRICT WE'VE HAD SOME MEETINGS UP HERE. AND I CONTINUE TO APPRECIATE THE- SOLUTION ORIENTED APPROACH THAT THEY HAVE- THE LETTER- PREDATES THE AMENDMENTS. THE MANAGER JUST TAKEN PRETTY MUCH THIS MORNING SO MISTER A MAY NOT BE AWARE OF ALL OF THEM ONE OF THE THINGS ON HIS LIST WE CAN CROSS OFF BECAUSE WE'VE ADDRESSED IT WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE RAISED. THE THRESHOLD FOR THE AMOUNT OF COPIES IN A PROJECT FROM FIFTY CUBIC YARDS TO FIVE HUNDRED- WHICH IS ONE OF HIS REQUEST IN HIS LETTER SO I THINK WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ALREADY. AND WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH HIM AND WE FEEL THAT THEIR INPUT IS IN GOOD FAITH AND- WE MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF IT BUT WILL LISTEN ALL OF IT. AND WILL HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEE AN NINE MISTER BOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES AT THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO THANK THE INDUSTRY AGAIN FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT FOR BEING HERE TODAY- I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP TO HELP US- COULD YOU TO MOVE TOWARD OUR GOALS OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE% GAS EMISSIONS AND HAVING A HEALTHIER PLANET AND RESPECT THE ATMOSPHERE.
