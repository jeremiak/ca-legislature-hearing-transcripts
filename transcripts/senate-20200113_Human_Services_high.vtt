AND CENTER JACK'S PLACE. OF

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:56.883
QUESTIONS I NOTED THAT THIS

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.254
BILL- HEADED PRIOR ITERATION IS

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.322
SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE WHAT HI

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.191
THIS IS BILL THEIR FEAR FROM

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.827
RIGHT SO IN SIX SEVENTY FIVE WE

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:08.961
WERE ALREADY TRYING TO BE.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:11.697
DESCRIPTIVE BUT PREDICT TO WHAT

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.933
TYPE OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.704
THE- BENEFICIARY SHOULD HAVE A

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.973
OF IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.510
VENDOR WHO MIGHT BE. PROVIDING

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:26.379
THEM EITHER THE MEAL FOR THE

FOOD USING THE EBT BENEFITS

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:31.384
RIGHT SO WE WERE BEING SPECIFIC

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.521
AND THAT WAS IN IN JUST MOVING

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:38.124
IT THROUGH THE PROCESS NUMBER

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.792
ONE WE ALWAYS RUN INTO A COST

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:42.295
PROBLEM WHEN WE'RE BEING THAT

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:45.631
SPECIFIC AND NUMBER TWO IT WAS

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:47.300
SETTING OF THE AGENCY NOT

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:49.602
REALLY. WHILE WHILE I WILL SAY

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:51.671
I THINK THAT MUCH OF WHAT WE

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:54.340
IDENTIFIED IS PROBABLY SPOT ON

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:55.875
IT IS BETTER TO HAVE THE

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:59.078
STAKEHOLDERS DEVELOP THAT

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.079
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO NO

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.949
THEN THE DESIGN IT SO THAT IT'S

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:05.651
MOST EASILY IMPLEMENTABLE AND

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:09.355
SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT BACK. WE.

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:11.190
IN EFFECT REVAMPED AND DECIDED

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:12.291
ALL RIGHT INSTEAD WE WILL

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:14.594
DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO SET UP

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.194
A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO COME

POPULATION OF OLDER PEOPLE IS

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:41.727
BROADER THAN I HSS EVEN I MEAN

IMPORTANT- OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL.

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:19.731
NEEDS A LOT. OF WORK IT'S SORT

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:22.634
OF GOTTEN AMENDED APPROACHES.

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:24.870
AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM BUT WE- OF

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:27.306
AS AS WE TRY TO DEAL WITH- A

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:29.908

ACCESS OF. FUNCTIONAL NEEDS

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:33.645
COMMUNITY- A I THINK IT'S

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:36.448
IMPORTANT THAT. WE NOT CREATE

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:39.885
SO MANY LAYERS OF. IRAQ CHRISSY

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.119

THEIR THE ASSISTANCE FOR THEM I

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:00.572
JUST CAUTION AND JUST URGE

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:04.243
THAT. AS THIS BILL EVOLVES THAT

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:06.278
WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT YOU

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:10.749
DON'T WANT IT'S TO BE SO.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:13.685
SPECIFIC DAD IT INCLUDES-

00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:15.721
DOESN'T INCLUDE SO THAT IF IT

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:16.788
IS IN FACT THE COUNTIES THAT WE

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:20.459
REQUIRED TO DO THIS VERSES THE

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:21.960
UTILITIES OR WHOEVER IT IS THAT

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:23.095
ALSO. GOING TO TAKE

00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:24.463
RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN EFFECTIVE

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.132
PROGRAM ISN'T JUST ONE OF

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.935
SEVERAL SO THAT WHEN WE- WHEN

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:34.139
WE DO OUR- SORT OF THE- MAP OUT

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:35.574
THE- THE CHANGE

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.543
RESPONSIBILITIES IT LOOKS LIKE

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:39.878
A- YOU KNOW AN ALGORITHM

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:41.146
ITSELF. IT'S GOT TO BE I WOULD

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:43.782
SUGGEST PART OF A BROADER BUT

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:47.185
MORE COMPREHENSIVE- PROGRAM TO

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:50.222
ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THESE

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:51.924
FOLKS WHETHER IT BE A PSP A

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.226
SITUATION OR AN EMERGENCY

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:56.461
SITUATION OR GAINING ACCESS TO

00:19:56.528 --> 00:20:00.299
THIS- REDUCE ELECTRICITY RATES

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:02.301
THESE ARE. THESE ARE FOLKS AND

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:05.070
WITHIN THAT. THAT STE THAT

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:07.406
GROUP THE SUBSETS. OF

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:09.541
INDIVIDUALS WE SHOULD BE

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:12.778
ADDRESSING ALL OF THESE ISSUES-

00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:14.646
COLLECTIVELY RATHER THAN SAYING

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:16.248
WELL WE'VE GOT THIS GROUP OVER

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.283
HERE AND THEN COUNTY WILL HAVE

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.553
TO DO THIS FOR THIS GROUP. HERE

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.154
SO THAT WE END UP WITH SUCH A

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.624
QUAGMIRE. WHICH IS TO AND DON'T

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:26.224
KNOW WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:27.359
ARE SO I THINK IF WE INCLUDE

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:30.562
THESE ALL AS PART OF A VERY

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:32.030
NECESSARY GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:35.934
FUNCTIONAL NEEDS- I HSS WORK.

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:38.904
OF THE PEOPLE OF RECEIVING THIS

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:41.506
THIS ASSISTANCE IT'S ALL PART

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:44.543
OF A- OF A BIGGER WHOLE THAT WE

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.278
SHOULD BE ADDRESSING SO THAT WE

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.280
DON'T JUST KEEP CARVING IT UP

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:50.949
AND CONFUSING THE HECK OUT OF

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:51.550
OUR BUREAUCRATS IN OUR COUNTY

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:56.088
PEOPLE AS WELL. AND IF I MAY

00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:57.789
THERE'S THIS THING IS TMI RIGHT

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:58.357
THERE'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:00.058
SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE GETTING.

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.727
YOU KNOW GETTING UP. SOMETHING

00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:02.527
FROM ONE AGENCY IN SOMETHING

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:03.562
ELSE FROM ANOTHER ANY SCENES I

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:05.364
MEAN WE'VE DEALT WITH THE LACK

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.298
OF UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:09.267
AROUND CRISES. SO I THINK

00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:10.802
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE GOAL OF

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:12.337
THE BILL SHOULD BE. AN

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:14.940
INTEGRATED AND SORT OF

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:18.243
STREAMLINED APPROACH THAT'S.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.044
CALLIE CHURCHES FOR INSTANCE

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:19.878
HAD A HOTLINE THEY WERE THE

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:20.879
ONLY ONES SECRETARY GOLLY

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:22.047
STEPPED UP AND PUT A HOTLINE

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.081
TOGETHER SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.783
HAVE SOMEONE TO CALL IF THERE

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.284
COUNTY TWO ONE ONE DIDN'T WORK

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:28.186
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. CAN I GET

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:30.489
A GENERATOR WHERE DO I GO- GOD

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:32.290
BLESS HIM FOR I MEAN &lt;c.cyan&gt;y THEY&lt;/c&gt;

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:34.259
GOT THAT STOOD UP QUICKLY. BUT

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.628
NOW YOU'VE GOT. THAT PIECE OF

00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:38.597
INFORMATION OUT THERE DOES IT

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:40.198
DOES IT JUST DANGLE OFTEN

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:40.999
EITHER DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:43.268
KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN YOU GET THAT

00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:44.703
COMMUNICATION TOUCH POINT

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.104
ESPECIALLY WITH SOMEONE IN A

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:47.205
VULNERABLE COMMUNITY YOU GOT TO

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:48.140
USE IT EFFICIENTLY. RIGHT YOU

00:21:48.206 --> 00:21:49.474
DON'T WANT A FLOW CHART THAT

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:52.878
READS LIKE A ROCKET TO THE MOON

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:53.445
YEAH IT'S GOT TO BE SIMPLE.

00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:56.615
THAT'S WHEN TAKEN ABSOLUTELY.

00:21:56.682 --> 00:22:01.019

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:07.659
TRYING TO ADDRESS A VERY

00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:08.260
IMPORTANT NEED BE SHARING THAT

00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:10.295
ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.329
VULNERABLE HAVE THE INFORMATION

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:11.997
THEY NEED TO HELP. PROTECT

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.265
THEMSELVES CERTAINLY THE

00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:14.866
POSITION I'VE SEEN SITUATIONS

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:17.069
WHERE- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:17.903
DEPENDENT THIS IS LIFESAVING

00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:20.972
EQUIPMENT AND IF IT POWER GOES

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.340

CAN COMMUNICATE TO PEOPLE OVER

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:37.255
MOST MOST LIKELY WHO NEED THESE

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:39.357
TYPES OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS-

00:22:39.424 --> 00:22:42.127
