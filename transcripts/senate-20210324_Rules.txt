FROM THERE I TRANSFERRED TO CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS PART OF THE ALL NEW PRISON ACTIVATION TEAM. WERE OVERSAW THE ACTIVATION OF THE EDUCATION PROGRAMS. I AM PROMOTED TO ASSOCIATE WORD AT THAT SAME INSTITUTION WHERE THE RESPONSE OF THE EDUCATION PROGRAMS AS WELL AS RELIGIOUS AND VISITING PROGRAMS.

IN TWO THOUSAND TEN I RETIRED- I RETURNED AS WE TRY TO DO IT TO ASSIST THE L. REALIGNMENT OF THE MISSION WITHIN THE DIVISION CLAUDEL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS- MENTORING NEWLY APPOINTED WARNS ASSUMING THEIR NEW POSITIONS. I REINSTATED WILL- WHEN I REINSTATE AS WARDEN AT THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONS DIVISION TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I WAS REALLY ABLE TO OBSERVE MANY OF THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. OTHER GRADUATION CEREMONIES MANY OF THEM ATTENDED BY THE INMATES FAMILIES LOVED ONES. AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT THE IMAGE PARTICIPATE IN TO REGARD THEMSELVES FOR SUCCESS RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY. BY OPPONENTS COMMISSIONER HAS ALLOWED ME TO COME FULL CIRCLE TO SEE HOW THE PROGRAM CDCR HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING. WITHIN THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE BENEFITING THE INMATES AND THE COMMUNITY RESULTING FROM THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS. I'M ABLE TO WITNESS FIRSTHAND THE CHANGES INMATES ARE MAKING. OUR DURING THESE HEARINGS AND OTHER PROGRAMS. REALLY ENHANCE BOTH IN MAKING PUBLIC SAFETY. AGAIN MY GOAL IS TO IS TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY AGAIN- PROVIDING HOPE FOR THE INMATES- CONDUCTING FAIR AND IMPARTIAL HEARINGS BECAUSE IT WORKS ON BOTH. IN THE INSTITUTION. OF THE WITH A LOT OF REDUCTIL REDUCE VIOLENCE- FROM THE PAST WHEN THEY DIDN'T REALLY SEE HOPE. WITH THIS WHOLE. OTHER WORKS AGAIN FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL SO AGAIN IT'S AN HONOR. WE SHOULD BE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. COMMISSIONER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GOING TO TURN FIRST TO SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN AND LET ME JUST SAY THEM MR BARTON AND MR SOLOMON I'M THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT HAS ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH CONFIRMATION AS WELL. AND MY SPOUSE MADE THE SAME CHOICE THAT YOUR SPOUSE IS MADE AND NOT ONLY THAT WHEN I WAS ASKED IF HE WAS PRESIDENT I SAID MY CONFIRMATION WAS BETTER SERVED BY HIM NOT TESTIFYING SO OUR CONGRATULATIONS ON NOT GOING THE EXTRA STEP. HOME I WOULD LIKE TO AND MAYBE START WITH MISTER BARTON. I HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH ALL FIVE OF YOU IN TWO DIFFERENT MEETINGS. AND THE INTERESTING THING FOR ME TO SORT OF EXPLORE. WHAT'S THE LEVEL OF DISCRETION AND THE LEVEL OF HOW YOU TRUSTED INFORMATION AND HOW YOU TRUSTED YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT CAME IN FRONT OF YOU IN RENDERING A JUDGMENT. OF IT IN A HEARING AND I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR EACH OF YOU TO JUST BRIEFLY. TELL US ABOUT YOUR PROCESS AND HOW YOU GO THROUGH THAT BECAUSE IF YOU ALL ANSWERED IT VERY SATISFACTORY IN OUR MEETINGS BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO. TO HEAR ABOUT IN PUBLIC. AND I DON'T MISTER BARTON AND WIFE TO JUST FIGURE OUT WHERE WE GO FROM THERE. I'LL BE HAPPY TO START WE DID HAVE A GOOD CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT. AT LEAST THE OTHER TWO AND IT IS MY COLLEAGUES THAT JOIN ME IN OUR CONVERSATION WE'RE WE'RE ALL PRETTY SIMILAR THAT A LOT OF IT COMES DOWN TO PREPARATION AND BEING AS PREPARED AS YOU CAN GOING INTO THE HEARING AND WE HAVE MANY TOOLS THAT ENABLE US TO DO THAT THAT ARE PROVIDED BOTH IN THE RECORD. FROM THE INMATES OWN CENTRAL FILE THINGS LIKE HIS PROBATION OFFICER RECORD AND THEN PROVIDED BY THE BPH SUCH AS A RISK ASSESSMENT THAT'S TYPICALLY DONE BEFOREHAND AND GIVES US MUCH VALUABLE INFORMATION AND OPINIONS FROM ANOTHER EXPERT IN THAT CASE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERTS. AND THEN ALL OF US BRING A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU HEARD ALREADY JUST FROM THE FIVE OF US IN THE AREA OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PRISONS AND- IT'S A MATTER OF THE TALKING TO THE PERSON IN FRONT OF US AND REALLY TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THEY'VE CHANGED YES THEY KNOW THEMSELVES. AND WHO THEY WERE WHEN THEY CAME TO PRISON AND THEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENTS THINGS LIKE THEIR CONDUCT IN PRISON PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE TAKING HOW WELL THEY'RE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE TOOLS THAT THEY GAINED BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW THEY UTILIZE THOSE TOOLS TO AVOID- MISCONDUCT OR OTHE. MAYBE NOTHING THAT RISES MISCONDUCT BUT OTHER ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE IN THE PRISON SETTING AND SO WE PUT ALL. THAT TOGETHER AND I THINK I SHARED WITH. BOTH OF THE CENTER THAT I PREMIUM WITH. I FIND THE IN PERSON HEARINGS PERSONALLY- GIVE ME JUST A SLIGHT MORE EDGE ON JUDGING SOMEONE'S RESPONSES BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FULL. ABILITY TO OBSERVETHEIR MANNERISMS AND THEIR BODY LANGUAGE X. CETERA HOWEVER I AM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT NOW THAT WE'RE DOING THEM VIRTUALLY. WE DON'T LOSE THAT MUCH OF THAT- PROBABLY LESS THAN I THOUGHT WE MIGHT AND SO I THINK WE'RE STILL ABLE TO APPLY OUR JUDGMENT BASED UPON THEIR ANSWERS AND OF COURSE WERE GIVEN. TRAINING ON A CONSTANT BASIS AS FAR AS ON HOW TO WAIT VARIOUS MATTERS WE HAVE A STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING TOOL THAT WE USE TO HELP PREPARE SO ALL THOSE THINGS COME TOGETHER WITH OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND THE CONVERSATION THE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE- INMATE. AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. APPLYING THE INMATES PRESENT SOME LIFE TO THE LAWS WE HAVE IN THE REGULATIONS THEY COME UP WITH A JUST DECISION AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS ECHOED BY MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO GO DOWN THE LIST SENATOR IF YOU WANT AND IF THEY WANT TO IF ANY OF YOU WANT TO ADD TO IT YOU CAN IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED JUST- FEEL FREE TO SAY SO- COMMISSIONERS. HELLO WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND COMMENT NEXT. OKAY THANK YOU. WE LOOK AT OUR PROCESS- AS A COMMISSIONER HOLDING. THESE HEARINGS. ON IN OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE OFFENDER WENT IN OUR REVIEW. OF THE RECORD THAT IS BEFORE US. WHAT WE DO IS WE WAY OUT AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING FACTORS PERTAINING TO THE OFFENDERS. ADJUSTMENT WE WAY OUT HIS CONVICTION WE WAY OUT PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY AND BEHAVIOR WE- ARE CONSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOR WE LOOK AT THE OFFENDERS WORK HISTORY AND VERY IMPORTANTLY WE A WAY OUT. HIS INVOLVEMENT IN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING- WE ALSO CONSIDER THE WRITTEN STATEMENTS PROVIDED BY THE OFFENDERS AND OTHERS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE PROCESS. IN RENDERING OUR DECISION WE MUST RENDER A DECISION THAT IS SUPPORTED BY A STATEMENT OF REASONS OF WHY WE HAVE DETERMINED WHETHER THE INMATE POSES A CURRENT UNREASONABLE RISK TO SOCIETY OR AN INMATE SO. WE MUST DENY PAROLE AND ON THE OTHER HAND- WE RENDER A DECISION BASED ON- REVIEW OF ALL THE FACTORS AND IF IT COMES OUT THAT HE DOES NOT POSE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO SOCIETY AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE MUST GRANT PAROLE SO IT'S JUST IT'S- IT'S A PROCESS WHERE WE- ALMOST LIKE- COMMISSION BARTON SAYS WE ARE LOOKING AT. THE OFFENDER'S WHOLE HISTORY FROM. THE STARTS FROM WHERE HE OR SHEWAS PRIOR TO AND DURING THE EVENT IN THE FENCE AND THEN WE MOVED FORWARD AND WE ASSESS WHERE HOW FAR THEY HAVE COME. SINCE THAT. COMMISSIONER THANK YOU- ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD COMMISSIONER DILATORY TO THAT. YES I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ADD A COUPLE OF THINGS- AND I THINK BOTH COMMISSION IS ALREADY HIT ON THEM BUT I'LL JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE- THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING AS A VERY GOOD TOLD THAT ON MY DRESSES ALTHOUGH SOME AREAS THAT MISSION IN CHICAGO. TALKED ABOUT THE PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY THAT OFFENDER SELF CONTROL THE PROGRAMMING THIS ATTENTION TO BE ABLE THEIR THEIR PROFILES OR THE CHRONICLE AFTER THIS- THE COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT- WITHOUT THEIR CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT IS A GOOD TOOL. BAD BRINGS UP CONCERNS THAT THE CLINICIAN HAD AT THE TIME AND GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THOSE- AREAS OF CONCERN DURING THE HEARING- SOMETHING THAT I LIKE TO DO- IN ADDITION TO ASKING. QUESTIONS ABOUT TOOLS AND SKILLS THAT THEY LEARN DURING PROGRAM I LIKE TO GIVE THEM SKINNER OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE I REALLY THINK AT THAT POINT USED OR SEEN. HAVE THEY REALLY APPLIED AND THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED SO- THAT'S HOW- I LIKE TO PAY. FOR MY HEARINGS AND ALSO- HAVING. TAKEN INTO. FROM YOUR YOUR PATH YOU'RE YOU'RE CALL ALSO WORKING WITH BECAUSE- AND- INDIVIDUALS THAT ALSO. ARE PREPARED HER WELL AND- WE NEED TO A JOINT SESSION TOGETHER. AND- I THINK ALL THAT. COMES TOGETHER IN THE END. MAKING THE BEST DECISION AT THE TIME WITH ALL THE INFORMATION AND THE FACTORS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER. YEAH I JUST DO I GUESS AT SOME EXCLAMATION POINTS WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID SO WHAT WE'RE AFTER REALLY IS YES HAS THAT AND MAKE CHANGE WE USE THE WORD CHANGED YOU HAVE THEY REHABILITATE. OR MADE NO LONGER THAT SAME PERSON ANOTHER IN STATE TO RETURN TO SOCIETY AND SO THAT'S ALL THE ITEMS THAT WE LOOK AT ANY IS AND IF YOU ASK STRAIGHT UP WHEN THEY WHEN THEY COME TO A HEARING. ARE YOU SUITABLE FOR PAROLE OR HAVE YOU CHANGED THAT WAY SAY YES AND THEN IT WILL NOW PROVE THAT TO US HELP HELP US PROVE THAT THEN WE AND THAT'S HOW WE PROVE IT BY. THEIR STATEMENTS THEIR PROGRAMMING EVERY EVERY MINUTE THE PREVIOUS MISSION OF TALK ABOUT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD LOOK AT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- COMMISSIONERS ARE SULLIVAN. IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW THAT BUT- WE'LL SEE OPEN. WERE WHERE I WAS TO YOUR REALLY TRYING TO IT A TERM. ON ON- THE INMATE IS NOW SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU AS OPPOSED TO WHO. SHE WAS. WHEN- THEY WERE INCARCERATED. OF WILL KIND OF WORK WORK REPORTS WORKS GREAT WORKS IT GIVES AN IDEA OF THE WORK ETHIC- ARE THEY THERE- HOW THE PERFORMING I'M ALSO AT LARGE REQUIREMENTS HOW THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH STAFF- THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S HOW THEY'RE ON. THE SILLY TAINING SELF HELP PROGRAMS OR OTHER TYPES OF BONE REBUILDING A PROGRAM TO TAKE LEADERSHIP ROLES- HAVING INTERNALIZED IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER YOU KNOW- SCENARIO TYPE QUESTIONS TO SEE IF THEY'VE INTERNALIZED THE COPING SKILLS IN THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN THESE. IN THESE- REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND EVEN IF IT IS AND I'LL- WE LEAVE THEM WITH RECOMMENDATIONS WILL LET HER KNOW ON THE AREAS OF CONCERN AFTER NO. OTHER GIVEN RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT THE SHOULD PURSUE A TO REPAIR THEMSELVES NOT SO MUCH JUST JUST TO BE IN FRONT OF THE FOR. WHATEVER IT PREPARE THEMSELVES TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE- REPAIR THEMSELVES AND THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE- THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO OUT AND BE SUCCESSFUL. BEING ASSET BE AN ASSET TO THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU- YES NO UNSURE IF I CAN DO. MAKE A PLAY THE- I THINK- OF PLAYING THE SAN COM WONDER COMES WITH THIS. SO I JUST. I WOULD JUST DO ONE QUICK FOR A FOLLOW UP FOR MISTER BARTON. BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME. ISTHAT THERE ARE OCCASIONALLY ON BOND HEARINGS TO RE LOOK AT THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THE HEARINGS THAT SOME OF YOU MIGHT. HAVE DONE INDIVIDUALLY AND YOU SAID THAT EVERYBODY GETS REVERSED OCCASIONALLY. ARE COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT PROCESS AND COULD YOU TALK SHORT WHAT YOU LEARN FROM IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS. SURE I WILL SAY WHEN I STARTED- HAVING BEEN THE HEAD OF AN AGENCY IS- OTHER THAN WHEN I MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE I WAS PRETTY MUCH RUNNING THINGS AND SO IT WAS A LITTLE. WITH A LITTLE TREPIDATION I WANTED MY FIRST AND BOND HEARING WHEN I FIRST HAD A CASE. THAT WAS SENT BACK TO ALL THE COMMISSIONERS BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE SIXTEEN OR FIFTEEN OR HOWEVER MANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES READING YOUR TRANSCRIPT AND LITERALLY. YOU KNOW SITTING. IN YOUR PLACE AND RETHINKING THAT DECISION AND SO WHAT I EXPLAINED CENTER IS THAT NOBODY IN THIS JOB ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES- TAKES IT PERSONALLY WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT ON EVERY ANY GIVEN DAY REASONABLE MINDS MAY DIFFER AND WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT NONE OF US IS PERFECT WE MIGHT MISS SOMETHING. THAT OTHER PEOPLE SEE AND SOWE ALL TAKE THAT AS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE I KNOW FOR ME IT CERTAINLY WAS- HAVING A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND- THOSE CASES CAN COME BACK AND BONTA IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS ONE OF THEM. I THINK I MENTIONED. TO ONE OF THE SENATORS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN THIS MORNING. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SELL PREFER IF FOR SOME REASON YOU MADE A DECISION AND YOU KNOW A DAY OR TWO LATER YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT IT IT HAPPENED TO ME ONCE AND I THINK- I THINK I'VE DONE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED HEARINGS AND- WHERE ME AND WHILE THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AND I TALKED ABOUT IT. IN THAT CASE WE ACTUALLY DENIED SOMEBODY AND THE MORE WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE MORE WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW LET'S EVERYBODY TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SO WE CAN SELL FOR IT AND THEN IN THE NEXT EN BANC MEETING ALL THE COMMISSIONERS WILL LOOK AT IT. AND REEVALUATE THAT DECISION OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR CAN REMOVE CAN SEND CASES BACK AND BONK- FOR ALL OF THE COMMISSIONERS TO LOOK AT. FOR VARIOUS LEGAL REASONS- BUT OFTEN TIMES IT'S TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE FOR. THE REST OF THE COMMISSIONERS FELT THAT ONE COMMISSIONERS GRANT WAS IN PROVIDENCE. AND THAT OUR LEGAL TEAM THAT REVIEWS ALL OF OUR CASES. CAN ALSO BRING IT BACK. TO THE REST OF THE- BOARD EMBARK OFTENTIMES BECAUSE MAYBE THERE'S AN ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER THE RECORD WAS GOOD ENOUGH ONE OF THE POINTS COMMISSIONER CHAPELLE MADE AND I THINK COMMISSIONER SOLOMON CHECK. SECOND IT IS AT ALL OF OUR DECISIONS ARE GOING TO GET REVIEW WHETHER TO GRANT OR DENIAL GETS REVIEWED BY SOMEONE OBVIOUSLY GRANTS AND OF IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE NILES COULD END UP IN SUPERIOR COURT HELLO CORD FEDERAL COURT. BUT THEY ALL GET REVIEWED BY OUR OWN OFFICE SO THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A REVIEW PROCESS AND THAT'S WHY THIS JOB IT'S SO IMPORTANT. TO MAKE A RECORD AND BASE YOUR DECISIONS ON EVIDENCE AS COMMISSIONER CHAPELLE SAID THAT IS STATED IN THE RECORD AND SO THAT WAS ONE OF MY BIGGEST- I THINK BENEFITS OF THAT PROCESS WAS LEARNING HOW IMPORTANT RECORD IS. BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GO THROUGH HEARING. AND THINK THAT YOU'VE COVERED SOMETHING ADEQUATELY AND THEN YOU GO BACK AND READ. THE TRANSCRIPT WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT NONE OF US. SURE DOING IS READING OUR INTO. I KNOW I CERTAINLY DON'T. AND YET SEE IT. AND REALIZE ALL HOW DID I MISS THAT BUT IT'S A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR THE NEXT TIME SO. IT IS AN INVALUABLE PROCESS- IT IS BOUND TO HAPPEN TO ALL OF US AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY. WE WOULD LIKE TO NOT HAVE IT HAPPEN OFTEN AND HOPEFULLY THE MORE WE- GO WITH MORE EXPERIENCE A LESS OFTEN IT HAPPENS BUT THAT'S A PROCESS. THANK YOU THAT WAS REALLY THOUGHTFUL AND THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR ALLOWING ME TO PURSUE THIS QUEST. THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK IT'S HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US LET ME ASK OUR OF VICE CHAIR TO GO NEXT SENATOR. THANK YOU I'M M. PRO TEM AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SEE IT OF FILES OF- MYSELF IN NORTH OF COMMISSIONER I MEAN IF. WE'RE MEMBER A LAYERED BECAUSE HE DID COVER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ALL. OF FIRST AND FOREMOST LET ME THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE OF ALL OF THE BOARDS. THAT WE HAVE APPOINTMENTS TO IN OUR LEGISLATURE THEIR FOOD OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO SURVIVE SO THANK YOU ALL. FOR YOUR SERVICE- IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE THE NUMBER OF. YOU HAVE COME BACK HE SAID I'M NOT DONE WITH F. SO POLITICALLY SPEAKING SOMETIMES WE WONDER WHY WE RAN AGAIN FOR OFFICE AND IT DOESN'T COMPARE TO OTHER CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACE BUT- WHAT I DID NOTICE IN YOUR RESUMES WHICH IS KIND OF INTERESTING OF OR IN THE PANDEMIC THAT. COMMISSIONER BARTON COMMISSIONER SHOULD HAILING COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER YOU AUTHORED PRE PANDEMIC WITH. ALL YOUR INTERVIEWS OF ALL POTENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR PAROLE. AND THEN HAD TO MOVE TO THE VIRTUAL AS WE HIT THE PANDEMIC. COULD YOU SHARE WITH US- THE DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD THE DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT'VE NOT BEEN SO GOOD IN TERMS OF YOUR EVALUATION. FOR GRANTING PAROLE- WAS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES DID YOU FEEL CLOSER TO THE INDIVIDUALS OR- AS SOME OF US ARE FEELING WAS. WITH THERE'S A- CONNECTIVITY THAT'S MISSING IN TERMS OF REALLY FEELING WHAT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE THINKING AND SAYING. AND WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION WHEN RESUMING WITH PEOPLE THAT TOUGH WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT KIND OF JUDGMENT ON SO COULD YOU JUST SHARE OF. A FEW OF PERSPECTIVES FOUND OUT FOR US BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL BE A AN ISSUE GOING FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO DO VIRTUAL. INSTRUMENT FOR FOOD BECAUSE THAT SERVING WELL AND PERHAPS BETTER LIKE TELEMEDICINE FOR EXAMPLE. THE WITHOUT TO. ANY ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AND CERTAINLY THAT'S OPEN NOT TO. COMMISSIONER DAY DAYLIGHT TOURE DID I SAY THAT CORRECTLY. AND- COMMISSIONERS. ALL OF AND THAT JOB WHICH YOU INTERESTING TO HEAR COMMISSION MARTIN. WHEN HE STILL ABOUT THE ABILITY CAN- WE THE VIRTUE INTER. I'M NOT GONNA GO I I'LL DEFER TO MY CALL BUT I HAPPY TO AFTER THEY GIVE THERE IS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HOG ALL OF THE ANSWERS HERE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT.I ALL RIGHT TO STRIKE COMMISSION SHALL. OKAY WELL I DO WANT TO SAY- MAKING THE TRANSITION TO- VIDEO CONFERENCE HEARINGS- FINANCIALLY- THEY WERE THEY WERE THERE IS LITTLE CHALLENGES- AND IF IT HAD TO DO WITH TECHNICAL- CONNECTIVITY- BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW PROCESS TO EVERYONE- IS FOREST HILL IMPACTING. MY HEARINGS- I THANK I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT WASN'T A BIG IMPACT FROM I WAS STILL ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE OFFENDER I WAS STILL ABLE TO GO OVER ALL OF THE FACTORS THAT ARE INVOLVED. YEAH I DID SEE THAT WAS KIND OF CHALLENGING ADDITIONALLY ARE FOR SOME OF THE OFFENDERS BECAUSE SINCE THIS WAS A NEW PROCESS THEY WERE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT HAD- HAD HEARINGS PRIOR TO THIS NEW PROCESS AND WE WERE SEEING THEM ON A SUBSEQUENT HEARING- SO WHAT IT DID IS IT. IT WE AS COMMISSIONERS HAD TO TAKE THE TIME TO REALLY EXPLAIN THE PROCESS. REALLY MAKE SURE THAT AS BEST THEY COULD HOPE TO MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROCESS BUT ONCE WE GOT GOING ON EVERYONE PRETTY MUCH KEEP THE CAME ON BOARD SO. I THINK- THIS PROCESS- IT WAS A GREAT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS- I DON'T THINK OUR OUR WORKLOAD WELL WE LOST ANYTHING WITH OUR WORKLOAD AND THAT WAS A BIG CONCERN- BECAUSE WE STILL WANTED TO BE ABLE TO- BE ABLE TO SEE THE CD OFFENDERS IN THE HEARING PROCESS. WELL I WANT ANYONE OF THE REST OF YOU TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I'M JUST THINKING OUT BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EASIER. IF I IN TERMS OF THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT TRAVELING AROUND THE STATE TIED TO DO YOUR HEARINGS MAYBE IT. IF IT'S AS EFFICIENT AND PROVIDE YOU. THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SEEK ANSWERS BEYOND IT WOULD STARTED MAYBE JUST ON THE- KIND OF WITHIN THE INDIVIDUAL CUTTING GET INTO THEIR THEIR PSYCHE IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEY'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO RETURNING TO. TO SOCIETY AND DONE AS A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER- IF THAT DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH YOUR ABILITY TO. REALLY FEEL ND KNOW THAT. THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PROVIDED PERHAPS MORE EFFICIENCY. AND CERTAINLY BEEN POTENTIALLY- BETTER FOR YOU AND- CERTAINLY THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED WE'RE HOPING TO BE PAROLED AND GET BACK. WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND WITH LIFE SO WE PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT GOING FORWARD I HAVE JUST ONE MORE QUESTION BECAUSE I'VE BEEN VERY INTERESTED. IN THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS I'M VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. OF THE OF THE REFORMS THAT ARE LOOKING OUT TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY GOT OFF ON THE WRONG TRACK BUT TO GET BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AND I WONDERED IF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE THAT ARE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE CONTINUED DURING THE PANDEMIC HAS THERE BEEN ANY INTERRUPTION THAT YOU'VE NOTICED MADE A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF. OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY ATTENDING ARE BEING COMMITTED TO. THEIR REHABILITATION PLAN. OF ANY THOUGHT FOUND OUT. SIR IT'S SLOW. THERE BUT ALL OF US LOOK FROM. PERIOD OF POSITIVELY AND TATIAN LET ME ASK YOU TO STOP I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME. THE TO THE STENOGRAPHER- I DIDN'T ANNOUNCE MYSELF. NO NO NO NO NO IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T SHOW THE FACE OF WHO WAS TALKING I DO YOU KNOW WHO WAS TALKING BUT NOW I KNOW IT'S MISTER BARTON I'M REAL. OKAY I WILL PAY ATTENTION AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERSON SPEAKING- AS WE START SO- COMMISSIONER BARTON WILL YOU GO AHEAD AND FORGIVE MY INTERRUPTION- I APOLOGIZE I SHOULD ANNOUNCE MYSELF SO. I IN. THE CERTAINLY THE THERE IS- MORE FLEXIBILITY I THINK NOW BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING. FOR AND IN TERMS OF- OVERALL. YOU KNOW IN THIS PROCESS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. THAT WERE SEPARATED I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN SUBGROUPS MAYBE WHERE COMMUNICATION IS A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT- AND MAYBE THIS IS MORE TO THE PRIOR QUESTION DAN THEN THE QUESTION THAT YOU JUST ASKED BUT I SEE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THAT SOME GROUP THAT HAS OUT. COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES LET'S SAY SO EITHER SIGN LANGUAGE OR INTERPRETERS CASES LIKE THAT WHERE I THINK IT WOULD STILL BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO HAVE THOSE HEARINGS IN PERSON SO THAT'S MORE TO THE PRIOR QUESTION AS FAR AS THE QUESTION ABOUT THEIR PROGRAMMING OBVIOUSLY WITH THE PANDEMIC THEY SHUT DOWN A LOT OF THE GROUP PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T DO THAT. BUT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT LINK T CARRY A POSITIVE REHABILITATION IT'S ALMOST NEVER JUST WHAT THEY'VE DONE THE LAST YEAR WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW OUR TRANSFORMATION PROCESS AND HOPEFULLY HAPPENED YEARS AGO MAYBE FIVE TEN YEARS AGO WE'RE LOOKING FOR ABSENCE OF MISCONDUCT AND THEN IF THEY HAVE JUST STARTED PROGRAMS IN THE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD BEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT IF THEY WAITED THAT LONG BECAUSE MOST THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN OR WOMEN ARE HAVE BEEN. IN PRISON FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. THAT DOESN'T REALLY SHOW A VERY SINCERE OR- COMMITTED WHEN FOR PROCESS TOWARDS A REHABILITATION SO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT IN A PANDEMIC ISN'T REALLY GOING TO WORK AGAINST THEM IF WE SEE THAT THEY MADE GENUINE EFFORTS BEFORE THAT AND THEN I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL TALK ABOUT IT BUT WE'VE ALL BEEN INSPIRED BY YOUR CREATIVITY IN FINDING WAYS TO PROGRAM WHILE BEING BANNED. A LOCKED DOWN IN THEIR UNITS AND I'LL LET SOME OF THE OTHER SHARE SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WELL IT CERTAINLY HAS- LIMITED THEIR ABILITY TO PROGRAM IN THE LAST YEAR WE LOOK MUCH FURTHER BACK IN THEIR HISTORY AND HOW THEY'VE CONTINUED IT SO WE HAVE A BIGGER PICTURE. IF YOU WILL THAN JUST THE TIME PERIOD OF THE PANDEMIC. PHILIP JUST ASK WHICH COMMISSIONER ROSY SHOW ME YOUR HAND IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THIS- COMMENT. I'LL GO FIRST WITH COMMISSIONER SOLOMON AND THEN TO COMMISSIONER DALE TORY. THANK YOU YES JUST TO EXPAND UPON WHAT MR- BARTON WAS INDICATING IT'S THEY DO YOU REALLY SEE THEM START TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF OPPORTUNITIES BRILLIANT START MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO IMPEDIMENTS WHICH WHICH ARE GOING TO FACE WHEN THEY GOT TO THE COMMUNITY. SO YOU SEE THEM- GOING SWITCHING TO CORRESPONDENCE COURSES IN THE SAME SUBJECT AREAS- THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN FACE TO FACE IT GIVES YOU IT GIVES YOU SORT OF A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THEM AND THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF THEIR LIVES AND NOT LETTING SOMETHING STOP THEM FROM. FROM ATTAINING THEIR GOAL THEY'RE DOING THEIR READING BOOKS- AGAIN THE CORRESPONDENCE COURSES- THAT THEY ARE DIRECTED AT A GANG VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT- SUBSTANCE ABUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF THEM. UNDER THE PARTICIPATING BUT THE OTHER PART THAT GOES ON IN THESE IN THESE SOME. HOUSING UNITS IS WITH THE QUARANTINE THEY CAN STILL PROGRAM TOGETHER IN THE BILL AND THEY JUST CAN'T THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND MIX WITH OTHER BUILDINGS IN CASE ONE. ONE HAS BEEN INFECTED WITH KOBE IT OR THEY'VE BEEN- EXPOSED TO KOBE SO IN THEIR BUILDINGS ARE ACTUALLY CONDUCTING INFORMAL GROUPS ARE DIRECTED AT THEIR A ISSUES PEOPLE THAT WOULD ONLY BE IN THE GROUPS- WHEN THEY WERE FUNCTIONING. AS WELL AS OTHER TYPES OF- SELF HELP TO DO GOGI FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT THOSE ARE TYPICALLY DONE IN SALES OR IN SMALL GROUPS IN YOUR HOUSING SO THEY REALLY THEY REALLY HAVE BEEN. VERY ADEPT AT MAKING THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND REALLY HELPS US TAKE A LOOK AT. THAT AND YOU COMPARE THAT- WITH THEIR THEIR CONDUCT OVER THE YEARS HAS IT BEEN YOUNGER LOOKING FOR OFFENDER CHANGE SOMETHING IF THEY COME IN AND IT WAS A LOT OF FUN- THIS THERE HISTORY WITH THEM EARLY ON BUT YOU SEE A CHANGE IN YOU SEE THE TO MAKING THESE ADJUSTMENTS IT REALLY TELLS US THAT WHEN THEY CONFRONT. IMPEDIMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. AS WELL. WELL THANK YOU COMMITTEE DALY. THIS IS I THINK COMMISSIONER BOOK- COVER- WHY THE ONLY THING I WOULD LIKE SAY THAT WHEN THEY'RE WORKING ON THEIR CELL THEY HAVE ALSO WRITTEN LIKE A BOOK REPORTS OR REPORTS OF WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED AND- THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE READ OF PRIOR TO THE HEARINGS AND WE ASK ABOUT WE ASKED ABOUT THE REPORTS WHEN WE SEE THEM IN THE HEARINGS AND SEE HOW WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED APPLIES AND WHAT KIND OF APPLICATION- IN SKILLS THEY HAVE LEARNED. AS AS THEY WORK BY THEMSELVES THERE AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO FIND OUT THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE ACTUALLY COME BACK AND SAID YOU KNOW I REALLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK WITHIN MYSELF AND BE SLACK ON THESE- ON THESE THINGS AND THESE NEW TOPICS FIND MYSELF AND MYSELF IN MYSELF SO I'M IRATE YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THE PHONE RECORDS AS WELL THEY'VE BEEN. THEY'VE BECOME VERY- CREATIVE IN HOW THEY ON PREPARE FOR THEIR EARING THANK YOU THANK YOU DID THAT LET ME JUST SEE. DID ANYONE ELSE WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. OKAY SENATOR FROM I THINK YOU AYE AFTER THINK ALL. I BY PROBABLY FOR NOT HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU INDIVIDUALLY BEFORE BUT- LET LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE PANDEMIC OF DENTAL I MEAN WITH THE ZOOMING OUT WORLD IS DONE TO ALL OF US IT'S JUST THERE SEEMS TO BE. NOT ENOUGH TIME BUT I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE AND I THINK ON THE REHABILITATION ISSUES. WE HAVE TO GIVE HUMANKIND HOPE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT DOES AND IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE. THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK FOR ALL WHEN YOU'RE INTERVIEWING THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU'VE GIVEN THEM HOPE THAT THEY CAN RETURN. I TO OUR COMMUNITIES. IS SAFELY AND HAVE A GOOD LIFE. WE THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT KIND A DEEPER DIVE INTO THIS VERY DIFFICULT TO A- QUESTION THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND CERTAINLY ON THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO BEEN INCARCERATED. SO WITHOUT THANK YOU AND- I KNOW YOU ALL DO A GREAT JOB. SENATOR BATES. YOU SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR WANTING TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK- AS I THINK I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH- THOSE OF YOU WHO I SPOKE WITH- THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS THAT YOU HOLD AND I ACTUALLY BELIEVE EACH OF YOU KNOW THAT- AND APPRECIATE IT- YOU ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES IN A VERY REAL. AND TANGIBLE AND CRITICAL WAY YOUR POSITIONS HOLD IMMENSE POWER- I THINK PROBABLY SOME OF YOU GLEANED FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS THAT I HAVE SORT OF SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONFLICTS. WITH THE CONSTRUCT OF PAROLE AND PAROLE HEARINGS BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE- AND SO COLLECTIVELY HOW DO WE WORK. YOU KNOW TO MAKE THIS BETTER- I DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH SOME OF YOU ALL BEFORE HAND AND I HAVE TO SAY- WAS. SURPRISED IN A PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH SOME OF OUR CONVERSATIONS AND ALSO CONCERNED- BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS IN THE WORDS THAT I HEARD THAT REALLY CONTINUE TO OBJECTIFY ARE INCARCERATED PERSONS. HAVING SAID THAT I BELIEVE YOU ALL HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO DO THIS WORK BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUED GROWTH- AND TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM. I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS REALLY ABOUT HOW TO BETTER PREPARE OUR INCARCERATED PERSONS FOR. THE PAROLE HEARING PROCESS ITSELF I KNOW MANY OF YOU SPOKE ABOUT SPOKE ABOUT COUNSELING AND ICC AND THE PROGRAMMING YOU ALL SHARED A LOT OF THAT IN YOUR RECENT RESPONSES- BUT I'M ACTUALLY REFLECTING ON MY TIME ON THE PENAL CODE REVISION COMMITTEE HEARING. AND THE DAY LONG SESSION WE HAD ON THE PAROLE HEARINGS AND A VERY INTENSE ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES FROM TWENTY TWENTY AND I THINK COMMISSIONER BARTON WAS ACTUALLY I GUESS FOLLOWED- FOR THAT ARTICLE- IT WAS REALLY COMPREHENSIVE. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU ALL HAD THOUGHTS ON HOW WE AS CALIFORNIA- THE STATE CAN BETTER PREPARE. ON CARS RATED FOLKS FOR THE HEARING PROCESS ITSELF IT'S LIKE HOW YOU WOULD PREPARE YOUR KIDS TO TAKE THE SAT. ON THE ONE HAND IT IS ABOUT. HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO PREPARE YOU KNOW FOR IN A SENSE IT'S A MORAL INTERROGATION. BUT THEN THEY'RE JUST SORT OF PROCEDURAL. STEPS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT- WHEN THEY'RE GOING UP FOR PAROLE HEARINGS THAT I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THEY SHOULD BE LEARNING FROM OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE INCARCERATED- SO I DON'T KNOW IF MAYBE ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF YOU ALL WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE- BOARD FOR LONGER. IF YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS ON WAYS THAT WE COULD. SORT OF AMPLIFIED THIS AND BETTER PREPARE OUR FOLKS. TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS THANK YOU SENATOR LET ME SEE A HAND WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT FIRST AND ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE YOU- OKAY COMMISSIONER BARTON- GO AHEAD. WHEN I THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE COUNSELORS BUT I KNOW WITH THE USE OF SANDERS THE WILD P. PROGRAMS THEY'RE GETTING THESE GUYS WHEN THEY FIRSTCOME IN AND THEY'RE EXPLAINING TO THEM. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGES IN THE LAW SPECIFICALLY YOUTH OFFENDER LAWS SB TWO SIXTY TWO SIXTY WANTED CENTER ON THOSE REFORMS- SO THAT THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE COMING IN AT YOUNG AGES. DON'T SAY MY LIFE IS OVER THERE'S NO HOLD I'M JUST GOING TO YOU KNOW DO WHAT I HAVE TO SURVIVE NO MATTER WHO I HEARD PRESENT. AND THEY'RE TRYING TO WEAN THOSE GUYS AWAY BY USING OLDER INMATES AS WELL AS- SOME OF THE OTHER- EDUCATIONAL PIECES TO TELL THEM LOOK THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO YOUR TIME SO YOU CAN GET OUT SOONER. I DON'T KNOW AND MAYBE THE WARDENS DO ALTHOUGH I I'M NOT SURE- IF WE DO THAT FOR ALL OF OUR LIFE COMMITMENTS WHEN THEY FIRST COME TO PRISON. I KNOW THEY GO THROUGH RECEPTION I KNOW THEY'RE GIVEN GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT PROGRAMMING- BUT I'VE OFTEN WELL I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE HAD GUYS SAY IF I'D- KNOWN. THEN WHEN I STARTED MY PRISON TERM WHAT I KNOW NOW I WOULD HAVE DONE MY TIME DIFFERENTLY. AND SO I THINK. CREATING SOMETHING AT INTAKE FOR LIFERS. MAKE THEM AWARE OF THINGS SUCH AS ELDERLY PAROLE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE- YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN. SHOW THAT YOU WERE CHANGING IT CETERA AT AN EARLIER POINT IN TIME- WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND AGAIN I'VE NEVER WORKED AT INTAKE STAGES AT A PRISON I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH. WE TELL THOSE GUYS OR HOW MUCH WE PAY ATTENTION TO A SENTENCE IF IT'S FIFTEEN TO LIFE VERSUS A STRAIGHT. TWENTY YEARS- BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT I THINK. IF YOU GAIN THAT INFORMATION UP FRONT AND THEN YOU HAD. STAGES WHERE YOU REITERATED NINE I'VE SAT IN ON. ICC'S WHERE WAR ROOMS OR OR CHIEF DEPUTY WARDENS ARE TALKING THESE GUYS AND TRYING TO GET ACROSS TO THEM AS WELL SO. MAYBE THAT'S THE PROCESS WHERE IT HAPPENS BUT I. JUST HEAR THAT FROM THE INMATES THAT IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD THEM THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY. THANK YOU DID I SEE YOUR HAND COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER- YEAH I GUESS I GUESS I PROBABLY SHOULD USE LITTLE OKAY. I'M HAPPY I'M HAPPY TO SEE A HAND REYES. FINE GO AHEAD COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER- YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING AT MY CALENDAR FOR THIS WEEK AND ON FRIDAY I HAVE FIVE CONSULTATIONS I DON'T KNOW IF ALL OF YOUR FAMILIAR ABOUT WITH WITH ABOUT FIVE YEARS BEFORE SOMEONE IS ELIGIBLE FOR A PAROLE HEARING. WE MEET WITH THEM AND WHEN WE DO OUR BEST TO COACH THEM THROUGH AND- SO IT'S AN INTERESTING CRY ACTUALLY ENJOY DOING CONSULTATION IS NOT AS MUCH AS HEARINGS BUT JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE I TELL I'M NOT MAKING A DECISIONTODAY NO SIR OR MA'AM YOU'RE MAKING THE DECISION. AND WE GO THROUGH A HEARING WE KIND OF A LET THEM KNOW THESE TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR FORTY FIVE MINUTES ONE HOUR EACH WE EXPLAIN TO THEM WE GIVE THEM WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION. I HAVE TALKED TO OTHER INMATES AND- I MEAN I ASKING ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS SIX SOMEBODY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SENATOR KERR LONGER AND- WHEN THEY COME TO PRISON THEY ARE TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE. IS WHAT THEY'LL SAY THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FIRST THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FIRST FIVE TEN AT STARLIGHT. THE ONLY START CARING AS WE GET CLOSER TO THEIR PAROLE DATE WHICH IS WHY. I THINK IT'S GREAT TO DO THESE CONSULTATIONS. AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT INMATES DON'T CARE ABOUT. SO YOU CAN KIND OF. IT'S THE SCOPE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. IF WE WHEN WE DO A HEARING WE- THEY TAKE A TEST OF ADULT BASIC EDUCATION WE TAKE THAT UPON COMING INTO PRISON. AND IT UP I'LL GET A GUY THAT'S GOING TO FOUR POINT TWO WHICH MEANS IN THE FOURTH GRADE. SURE YOU IN THE FOURTH GRADE WELL NO I'M NOT. WHY YOUR SCORE FOUR POINT TWO HEY I DIDN'T CARE I CAME TO PRISON I JUST CHECKED A BUNCH OF BOXES- I GOT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA YET I'M PROBABLY ABOUT TWELVE. SO PERFECT AND ALL ADDRESS YEAH I MEAN IT WILL GO FROM THERE. BUT IT'S THAT KIND OF. I GUESS RESISTANCE AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING I'M NOT SURE. WHAT WHAT THE- WHAT THE KEY AS WELL SOMETIMES IMPORTANT ACTORS REALLY IMPORTANT. ASKS QUESTIONS A MATTER OF FACT. THANK YOU DID I. OTHER OKAY. SENATOR GO HEAD. MADAM CHAIR JUST MY SECOND QUESTION IS I NOTICED- IN EUROPE THE REST YOU ALL DO A LOT OF TRAINING- ED MOST OF IT SEEMS TO BE BASED ON KEEPING YOU UP TO SPEED ON THE COURT RULINGS AND ON THE- SORT OF PROCEDURAL AND THE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE WORK- ARE THERE ANY. OTHER KINDS OF TRAININGS THAT YOU ALL WOULD LIKE TO HAVE TO SORT OF ROUND OUT- WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW OUR TO DO THIS WORK. ANYONE. WE ARE ARM COMMISSIONER BARTON THANK YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET ASKED THAT EVERY MONTHS. EVERY TIME WE NEED AS A BOARD THERE IS A QUESTION BY THE CHAIR THAT SAYS ANY MEMBER HAVE ANY PARTICULAR TOPICS THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE TRAINED ABOUT I'VE RAISED MY HAND IN THE PAST ASK FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF TRAINING AND I HAVE TO SAY- MACHE FOR OUR DIRECTOR IS VERY RESPONSIVE WITHIN. USUALLY ABOUT ONE OR TWO MEETINGS THERE AFTER WE SEE THAT ITEM COME UP FOR TRAINING SO THINGS THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR IN THE PAST AND WE'VE BEEN TRAINED ON. HAVE BEEN ISSUES REGARDING WHAT THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING FOR RIGHTS BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE'LL GET INMATES THAT COME IN THAT ARE ENHANCED OUTPATIENT- FOR A LOWER LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE. IN THEIR FIVE. CERTIFICATES OF THE USUAL PROGRAMS WE SEE SO KNOWING WHAT. THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE PROVIDING TO THEM AND KNOWING THAT THEY CAN DO A PROGRESS NOTE TO TELL US WHERE THAT GUY USING HIS PROGRAMMING WAS INVALUABLE TO ME BEFORE I KNEW THAT WAS A POSSIBILITY SO- I BASS FOR THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR. TRAINING IN THE AREA OF SEX OFFENDERS WE'VE ASKED FOR TRAINING IN IN DIFFERENT AREAS DIFFERENT COMMISSIONERS HAVE REQUESTED SO. WE LITERALLY GET ASKED THAT QUESTION EVERY MONTHS. THANK YOU. OKAY SENATOR GO AHEAD THANK YOU I JUST WANNA- THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR WORK AND FOR YOUR- COMMITMENT TO SERVE THE STATE. YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE ALL IN STAGES OF REHABILITATION AND WE ALL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE DANGEROUS IT IS REALLY SUBJECTIVE AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS PAST YEAR IN COVERT I THINK HAS SHOWN. PEOPLE IN A VERY SMALL WAY I AM IN NO WAY COMPARING THIS TO BEING IN PRISON. TO WHAT IT IS LIKE TO NOT HAVE CERTAIN FREEDOMS AND LIBERTIES. AND IT HAS EXPOSED. THE FRAILTIES AND THE STRENGTH OF HUMAN EXISTENCE% BUT IT HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT WE NEED MORE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND WE NEED MORE ACCESS TO SUPPORT. TO KEEP BUSINESSES AFLOAT TO KEEP CHILDREN EDUCATED TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED AND TO KEEP MENTAL HEALTH AND A STABLE WAY. AND I JUST HOPE THAT AS YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DO YOUR WORK ON THIS BOARD THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS TOO BECAUSE I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE SPENDING YOUR ENTIRE LIFE BEHIND BARS AND HAVING TO LIVE IN A PARALLEL SPACE AND THEN GOING BEFORE A BOARD. TO ASK TO BE FREE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR OUR SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRETEND S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO APOLOGIZE I HAD TO LEAVE FOR A LITTLE BIT SO WITH MY COLLEAGUES DID ASK THESE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE I- YOU CAN JUST SAY IT'S BEEN ASKED AND I WILL AND- A FULL REFUND OR STOOD- SORRY THE GOOD SENATOR IS BETWEEN TWO COMMITTEES THAT MEET AT THE SAME TIME SO JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND- WE SOMETIMES ARE. MULTI TASKING- SENATOR GROW GO RIGHT AHEAD THANK YOU- MISTER MARTIN- YOU'RE FROM MY NECK OF THE WOODS IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU. WE MET YES. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- I THINK SO YEAH I KEEP SAYING IN THE REAL WORLD IN THE REAL WORLD I HAVE A BUSINESS THAT EMPLOYS WHAT I CALL SECOND CANCERS- THE SENATE PRO TEM HAS MET SOME OF MY TO STICK IT CANCERS AND- HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONES WERE SECOND CANCERS AND SOMEBODY WITH A COLLEGE- I BELIEVE IT. EDUCATION SO AM I THINK THAT HAVING A JOB IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WE CAN OFFER ANYBODY- BUT SPECIALISTS BUT SPECIFICALLY THOSE- THAT HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED IN THE PAST. BECAUSE I THINK THAT GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE- A VITAL MEMBER OF SOCIETY. IT HELPS THEM TO NOT- GO BACK INTO PRISON. IT GIVES THEM SOMETHING TO GET UP FOR EVERY MORNING IT GETS THEM MAYBE AWAY FROM THE PLACES THAT THEY WERE BEFORE THAT GOT HIM IN THE SITUATION OF THE BRAND- I HAVE SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE WORKED FOR ME THAT HAVE GONE ON FOR FULL TIME POSITIONS- THE ARGUMENT YOU KNOW SEVERAL OF THEM COME TO MIND THAT ARE LIKE SOME OF MY FAVORITES. BUT IS A MATTER OF FACT JERRY FLORES IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES HE- HE WORKS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY HE GOT A JOB THERE- CHOPPING WEEDS FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN HE GOT ELEVATED INTO POSITION DRIVES A COMPANY TRUCK. HAS JUST BOUGHT HIS FIRST HOME AND HIS SON RECENTLY WENT TO COLLEGE. THE FIRST MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY SO IT'S LIKE A GENERATIONAL THING THAT WAS BROKEN BECAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE HAD GONE TO PRISON SO. I THINK JUST HAVING THE JOB HE CAME FROM LOS ANGELES THEY SAID IF YOU WANT A JOB- IN YOU WANNA GET AWAY FROM THIS GO WORK IN THE OIL INDUSTRY AND- IN KERN COUNTY. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS AFTER ALL STATE AND ALL THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT- PIECE. OF FOR SUCCESS RATE. WHAT IS A IS THERE A PLAN LIKE WHEN YOU INTERVIEW ARE YOU TALK TO THESE PEOPLE IS THERE A PLAN IS THERE SOMETHING FOR WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO HELP THEM GET EMPLOYED. SO THAT THEY CAN STAY OUT WE CAN DO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S A VERY HIGH RATE IN CALIFORNIA. M. IS THERE A PLAN. ARE YOU POSE IN THAT TO ANYONE ANYONE OKAY LET ME SEE A- HAND OF SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO TAKE THAT QUESTION. OR COMMENT ON IT. I THANK YOU COMMISSIONER SOLOMON GO RIGHT AHEAD. IN IN THE IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AS WE AS WE ARE REVIEW THESE ON. INDIVIDUAL FOR IN DURING OUR HEARINGS IN THE PRISONS WE HAVE A VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT REALLY BEGIN AT LEAST TEACHING ENTRY LEVEL MARKETABLE SKILLS SO THAT WHEN THEY GET TO THE COMMUNITY THEY CAN- YOU CAN RETAIN HOPEFULLY IMPLEMENTING IT ONCE YOU GET OUT THERE A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH- NOT JUST THE- SKILL OF THE SPECIFIC TRADE BUT HOW DO. I DO- INTERVIEW HOW TO APPLY HOW TO COMPLETE AN APPLICATION TO WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET INTO A JOB. AND A LOT OF THE- VOCATIONAL STRUCTURES HAVE PRAYED ADVISORY COMMITTEES IN THE TRADE APPRAISAL COMMITTEES ARE CONNECTED TO THE COMMUNITY TO WORK- THEY CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS- TO EMPLOYERS OF INMATES TO GET READY TO ROLL OVER COMPLETED A PROGRAM- OR IS FAR ENOUGH LONGER PROGRAM TO WHERE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THE SKILLS- TO HOPEFULLY- SUCCEED IN WHATEVER. WHATEVER PARTICULAR- CHANGE YOUR TRADING THEIR TO GET IN. SEE HOW THAT AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE A- LIKE THE END OF COALITION. WHO ALSO IS OUT THERE AND THEY CONNECT THE PRISONS AND THEY HAVE SUPPORT IN THE PRISONS AND I THINK COMMISSION PART WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY PREPARE THEM- EARLY ON THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS. OF FOR THE BOARD PROCESS- WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GOING THROUGH THE COLLEGE I THINK IT'S BOM. PRE PREPARATION SUPPORT PREPARATION SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE. SO WE HAVE THAT PROCESS IN WHEN THEY GET OUT OF THE COMMUNITY- A. R. pASSISTANCE ONCE THEY GET OUT. THE IMAGE ALSO WHEN THEY'RE PREPARING FOR THE HEARING ARE COMMUNICATING AND ABOUT DEVELOPING YOUR SUPPORT GROUPS SUPPORT NETWORKS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH POTENTIAL PLAYERS WELL SO THEIR FAMILIES. ORGANIZATIONS MAKING CONTACT IN THE COMMUNITIES WELL TO- HOPEFULLY- GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO- GET A JOB ONCE THEY GET OUT. SO IS IT THERE'S A LOT OF. INFORMAL THINGS AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL LOCATION PROGRAMS EVEN THE- WORK PROGRAMS PRISON INDUSTRIES- AS FACTORIES THAT THE INMATES WORK IN. POLITICAL SKILLS AND GET CERTIFICATIONS. OF- COMPLETION OR HE ALSO SERVES. TYPES OF ARMS OF THE IN THE- AT THE WORKING IN. THOSE GO OUT WITH THEM I THINK THEY ALSO CAN CONNECT WITH EMPLOYERS AND THE COMMUNITY. OF TO HELP THE- IN MAY WITH AN OPPORTUNITY. TO AT LEAST INTERVIEW FOR A JOB OR MAYBE HAVE AN ENTRY LEVEL JOB ONCE I GET OUT. THANK YOU I SENATOR- THE SENATOR- COMMISSIONER BARTON GO AHEAD. YEAH I DON'T WANT THAT TITLE. I'LL JUST ADD TO THAT I AGREE BOTH P. I. EIGHT AND THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING OR GREAT JOB TRAININGS THE OTHER THING THE DEPARTMENT DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT IS EMPHASIZING EDUCATION AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE TO COME BEFORE US HAS COME INTO. THE SYSTEM WITHOUT A GED OR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA BUT BY THE TIME HEY REACH US ABOARD THE CHEAP ONE OR THE OTHER- AND I THINK THAT THAT IS ONE STEP FIRST LONG IMPROVING THEIR SELF ESTEEM WHICH GOES A LONG WAY AND THEN REALIZING THEY CAN'T HOLD A JOB THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE. IN THE SYSTEM THAT ARE INFORMAL FROM THE OUTSIDE AND NOTIFY VENTURES WHEN HE CAME INTO TAUGHT INMATES HOW TO RUN THEIR OWN BUSINESS THEY ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH COURSE AND LEARNED ENTREPRENEURIAL SHIP SO- I KNOW PERSONALLY IN FACT ARE YOU TALK ABOUT THE GENTLEMAN THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE- HE ACTUALLY WAS ALSO INTERVIEWED FOR ONE OF THEIR GUIDE BOOKS BE PREPARED. FOR INMATES TO PREPARE FOR PAROLE HEARING SO THERE ARE OUTSIDE ENTITIES ARE PROVIDING THAT TYPE OF ASSISTANCE TO INMATES WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON AND THEN WHEN YOU GET OUT. ALMOST ALL OF THE- PEOPLE THAT WE SEE ARE GOING INTO SOME OF TRANCE. PRO BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE THEM RIGHT OUT OF PRISON PUT ON SOMEONE'S DOORSTEP WE SEEN THAT THAT'S NOT. A SUCCESSFUL WAY TO PULL SOMEONE SO MANY OF THEM GO TO TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR. AND THE ONES THAT REALLY EXERCISE THEIR INITIATIVE AND LOOK FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS WILL PURPOSELY CHOOSE ONE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ONE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TEACHERS TRUCK DRIVING SKILLS. SO THEY DECIDE THEY WANT TO GO INTO A PARTICULAR JOB- THEY CAN ACTUALLY LOOK FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THAT HAS A CONNECTION TO THAT PARTICULAR- JOB. GROUP IF YOU WILL OR OCCUPATION SO THAT THEY CAN GET MORE RAINING WHILE THEY'RE STILL IN SORT OF A SEMI STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT THAT'S PROVIDING HOUSING AND THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO. TRY TO MULTI TASK AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL COMES FROM OTHER DOING JOB TRAINING WHILE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR I. D. IT CETERA ETCETERA SO. THERE ARE THINGS IN THE SYSTEM I CENTER GROWTH AND ARE BUILT IN TO TRY TO A SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT. HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT ARE TWO OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THEY'RE GOING TO FACE AND SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK- I WOULDN'T CALL IT A WRAPAROUND NECESSARILY THAT SOMEBODY COMES IN HOLDEN BY THE HAND AND TAKES CARE OF ALL THAT. BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT AVENUES THAT THEY CAN PROCEED DOWN. TO OBTAIN GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. THANK YOU ARE. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT- I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH AIR SEE I ACTUALLY HAD AN INTERN IN MY OFFICE HIS NAME WAS MARTINA NICHOLSON LIPS BECAUSE HE HAD. TATTOOED LIPS CELEBRANT. EBONY ACTUALLY WORKED IN MY SENATE LET AS AN INTERN IN THE SENATE LEADERSHIP OFFICE HE IS A- AT OR- THERE SHE DOES A LOT OF GOOD WORK AND THEN ALSO- GARDEN PATHWAYS IN KERN COUNTY BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY GO OUT AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET- WITH L. INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THEY ARE RELEASED- SO THAT THEY CAN TRY TO GET THEM- INTO PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL HELPFUL AND EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS AND CITY SERVE ALSO IN OUR COMMUNITY THEY ALSO HAVE A- RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COLLEGES TO DO SOME TRAINING SO. I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE GOOD THINGS OUT THERE BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GUYS WERE LOOKING AT THAT ASPECT I HAVE A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY FOR MISS AS DILATORY A YEAR I'VE MA'AM YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY A NEW TO THE BOARD AND- I KNOW THAT YOU WENT THROUGH EXTENSIVE TRAINING NIGHT MY COLLEAGUE I DID ASK ABOUT TRAINING BUT I DIDN'T HEAR THAT. THE COMMENT M. IF THIS WAS SPECIFICALLY IT BUT AND YOU WENT THROUGH SPECIFIC TRAINING IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU FOUND HELPFUL- THAT WAS BENEFICIAL ANYTHING HE THOUGHT WAS A WASTE OF TIME A SO THAT WE CAN IMPROVE ON TRAINING- THAT. FOR COMMISSIONERS WHEN THEY GO FORWARD. I DON'T THINK THAT NOTHING THAT I. WAS NOT TRAINED ON IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME I THINK I'M IT'S VERY INSIGHTFUL AND- YOU KNOW COMING FROM NEVADA. TRAININGS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT- BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS DIFFERENT IN- IN THEIR LAWS AND- FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED AS WELL SO. I THINK- WE HAVE HAD VERY VALUABLE TRAININGS. AND I THINK THAT AS I. CONTINUE WITH MY CAREER AS A COMMISSIONER AND I CONTINUED ATTENDING TRAININGS- I CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE ONE TRAINING THAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL REGARDS TO OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE TOP OF MY HEAD- THE INSTITUTION THAT HELPS WITH BRAILLE. AND KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE THOSE SERVICES FOR INMATES WHO. HAVE WHO CAN SEE WHO ARE LEGALLY BLIND- THAT OPENED UP MY EYES ON THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND ALSO AND THEY NEED TO GET SOME OF OUR INMATES HAVE. BAD OUT WE MAY NOT BE AWARE BECAUSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS SEE IN IT AN INMATE WHO HAS. YOU KNOW VISION PROBLEMS OR HEARING PROBLEMS SO. HAVING TRAIN ON ON- RESEARCHERS CITING THE COMMUNITY- WAS VERY HELPFUL FOR ME IN ON THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE THERE. AND- I THINK OVERALL THE TRAININGS HELP US TO KNOW WHAT'S REALLY OUT THERE. AND WHEN WE DO OUR CONSULTATIONS WERE ABLE TO- DIALOGUE WITH. THE INMATES. ON THEIR PRO PLANTS AND WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GO SO THAT- THEY HAVE THE 5% THEY NEED FOR THEIR SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY CITING THE TRAININGS THAT I'VE HAD HAVE BEEN VERY- INSIGHTFUL AND HELPFUL. IN IN MY CAREER. AS A COMMISSION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- I DO HAVE A- ABOUT SEE WHY. A CALIFORNIA FORTY. I KNOW YOU GUYS- THERE WAS SOME USE IN SOME CASES- WHEN THEY GET PUT INTO A PRISON SYSTEM. WHAT DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY DATA AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE IT TO ME TODAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT BUT IF YOU JUST GET IT TO MY OFFICE. I'D REALLY BE INTERESTED IN THE DATA- BECAUSE IT YEAH I SHOW ABOUT 21% OF YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE HEARINGS. RESULTED IN A DECISION TO GRANT RELEASE AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. HAS THERE BEEN ANY FOLLOW UP OR IS THERE SOME DATA THAT CAN SHOW YOU HOW SUCCESSFUL- THAT HAS BEEN AND IS THERE ANY OTHER THING THAT WE CAN DO MORE FOR YOUTH OFFENDERS. THANK YOU ALLEGE- COMMISSIONER BARTON TAKE THAT FIRST I SAW HIS HAND FIRST AND SENATOR WE WILL- AS A COMMITTEE FOLLOW UP. AND ASK THAT QUESTION OF THE SYSTEM TO GET SOME OF THAT DATA THANK YOU BUT ARE YOU READY HAD COMMISSIONER BARTON. I JUST WANT TO VERIFY T'S A DIFFERENT SYSTEM. SO THE USE OF TORY HELLO MORE DIFFERENT THAN US. AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY SEE ANYONE THAT'S- SEEKING PAROLE FROM SEE YA- SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE THOSE STATISTICS THERE IS A SEPARATE BOARD AND I THINK IT'S MUCH SMALLER THAN OURS. I THINK THERE'S MAYBE TWO OR THREE MEMBERS THAT DO ALL THE PAROLE HEARINGS FOR ARGUES THE FORTIES I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. IT'S JUST NOT ONE THAT WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH- BECAUSE WE DON'T WORK WITH THAT ENTITY. SO TO THAT DEGREE I WE COULDN'T PROVIDE THAT TO YOU FROM OUR BOARD- SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK IT'S ONE THAT COULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS- CERTAINLY THE USEFUL. PAROLE JUBILATE OF SEE YA. HELLO COMMISSIONERS- BUT THAT'S NOT A GROUP THAT WE DEAL WITH WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUTH OFFENDERS WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED THEIR CRIME POTENTIALLY A TWENTY FIVE OR YOUNGER. BUT TYPICALLY WE SEE IN BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE WHEN THEY'RE COMING TO PRISON. EVERY NOW. AND THEN WE'LL SEE SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS AND WHY. BEFORE THEY TRYING. TO IT IS IN THEN STILL THERE NOT PULLING OF SEE WHY THERE THROUGH OUR IN. UP ALSO IN THE BOARD PRO HEARINGS- I HOPE CLEARS WITH YOU THAT BACK IN. WOULD BE A DIFFERENT SOURCE ABSOLUTELY SIR THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THAT INFORMATION I WAS THAT. I HAD THE WRONG PERCEPTION SO I APOLOGIZE WE THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU OUR SENATOR I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION MAINLY BECAUSE I THINK MY COLLEAGUES IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GO LAST. I EVERYTHING HAS HOPEFULLY BEEN ASKED BUT I DID WANT TO ASK TO FOLLOW UP ON ONE OF SENATOR- CALM WATERS QUESTIONS. IN THE PAST I'VE BEEN ON RULES FOR THREE YEARS SO I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE. CONVERSATIONS WITH COMMISSIONERS- IN THE PAST AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS COME UP NOT JUST RELATED TO PROBATION WHICH WE- MENTIONED LAST TIME. BUT I WANT TO REFLECT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT COME FOR COLLEAGUES ARE NOT ON THE RULES COMMITTEE. THAT WE HAVE ADDRESS. AN THAT IS ALL- I TRAINED. OR NON BY- AT. MEMBERS FOR PROBATION OR PAROLE OR PAROLE. AND I. WE HAD SUGGESTED PREVIOUSLY THAT THERE BE A TRAINING RELATED TO THAT BECAUSE WE HAD GOTTEN- FEEDBACK THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF THE ISSUES REFLECTIVE FOR. SOME MEMBERS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AND I'M SURE THAT'S NOT THE ONLY EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO FEELS LIKE- THERE SHOULD BE TRAINING BUT THAT WAS THE ONE THAT BECAME IT BECAME UP- SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO ASK. IF YOU EVER FELT THAT TRAINING WAS HELPFUL. TO YOU- ANYTHING THAT YOU MIGHT SHARE ALONG THE LINES OF THAT EXAMPLE RELATED TO THE TRANS GENDER NON BINARY IN THE TRAINING. AND I'M HAPPY TO SEE WHO MIGHT WANNA RESPOND TO THAT. QUESTION YOU KNOW ALL RESPOND TO ANY OF THESE BUT I'LL LET SOMEONE ELSE ACCESS I WILL- FOR HONEST SAKE I WILL SAY THANK YOU COMMISSIONER I WILL START WITH- COMMISSIONER DALE TORY AND THEN I WILL GO TO COMMISSIONER BARTON. THANK YOU WHAT WE DID WE DID HAVE A TRAINING AND I BELIEVE IT WAS DURING THE WEEK. THAT WE HAD OR FORTY HOUR TRAINING FOR- THE PRO CONNECTION ERRORS. AND IT WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL- THEY TALK TO US ABOUT OUR PRONOUNS AND IMPORTANCE OF ASKING THE INMATE HOW THEY WANT TO BE REFERRED. DURING THE HEARING WHAT PRONOUNS. THEY PREFER- TO BE PRESSED TO USE- AND- IT'S- INSIGHTFUL I HAD IN IN ME JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND- THE INMATE ASKED ME TO. REFER HIM AS- INMATE SO AND SO AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S THEIR HEARING WE WANT THEM TO BE COMFORTABLE. AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS SOME WITH RESPECT ADDRESS EVERYBODY WITH RESPECT. AND I THINK IT MADE A WORLD OF A DIFFERENCE- THE FACT THAT WE WERE ON SENSITIVE. TO THAT TOO- THAT PREFERENCE THAT- HE HE WANTED TO BE QUALITY. SO. SO FELT WAS IMPORTANT. AND I THINK TRAINING- EDUCATED ME AND OPEN MY EYES ON- HOW TO BE VERY SENSITIVE ON THESE TOPICS. THANK YOU N. AS COMMISSIONER BARTON ISSUE ANSWER I MIGHT ASK ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR THAT STANDS OUT AROUND MEMBERS- A PARTICULARLY TRANSGENDER OR NON BINARY THAT HAS COME TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT YOU WOULD SHARE WITH US DO THEY FEEL. DO INDIVIDUALS WE WANT ALL INDIVIDUALS AS AS COMMISSIONER- DALY TORY MENTIONED- WANT TO FEEL THAT THEY'RE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND- ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT BUT- DO YOU FEEL THERE IS BECOMING A GREATER UNDERSTANDING THROUGH THE TRAININGS OF THE NEEDS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THE EMPATHY IS THAT. MIGHT BE EMPLOYED DIFFERENTLY FOR- EIGHTY SOME OF THESE PARTICULAR COMMUNITY MEMBERS VERSUS SOMEONE ELSE ANYTHING YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE COMMISSIONER BARTON. WELL NOW SAY OBVIOUSLY THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE CORRECT I'VE ACTUALLY HAD TWO TRAININGS NOW- IN THE LAST THREE YEARS SPECIFIC TO THIS AREA AND- BUT FOR ME IT I LOOK A LITTLE DEEPER THAN THAT AS FAR AS OUR ANALYSIS OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT COME BEFORE US. AND WHEN I'VE HAD- TRANSGENDER. AND OTHER. ONCE A NONTRADITIONAL- SINCE YOU WERE IN PRISON THAT ARE VIEWED BY THE REST OF THE POPULATION AS A POTENTIAL VICTIM THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I TAKE VERY MUCH INTO CONSIDERATION AS THE IG WE HAD SEVERAL COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT BY OUR OFFICE OF ABUSES THAT OCCURRED AND I KNOW THE WORDS COULD PROBABLY SPEAK TO THIS AS WELL AND SO WHEN I'M LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S RECORD WHERE THEY WERE A POTENTIAL VICTIM BECAUSE OF THEIR- GENDER PREFERENCE OR- BY THE REST OF THE POPULATION. YOU MIGHT SEE MUTUAL COMBATS FOR EXAMPLE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT YOU REALIZE IT WASN'T A MUTUAL COMBAT IT WAS THIS PERSON BEING VICTIMIZED. SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RECORD ESPECIALLY THEIR DISCIPLINE RECORD AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ACTUAL DETAILS UNDERLYING IT AND APPLY WHAT YOU KNOW FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WAS GOING ON. BEHIND THE SCENES- WHERE THEY WERE BEING VICTIMIZED AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS REAL IT'S SOMETHING THAT- I KNOW CDCR IS TRYING TO DO A BETTER JOB. ADDRESSING FOR ALL OF THOSE POTENTIAL VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BUT- IT'S SOMETHING THAT I DEFINITELY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN I'M LOOKING AT ESPECIALLY THAT DISCIPLINARY RECORD BECAUSE IT IS VERY REAL. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER- THE COMMISSIONER SULLIVAN THANK YOU GO AHEAD. YES I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE TRAINING TWICE ONCE AS A WARDEN- CDCR WAS PROVIDE TRADE IN CREDIT TOWARDS TOWARDS MEETING ALL IT WAS A PHYSICAL PLANT FACILITY ABOUT INDIVIDUAL OUT OF NEW MEXICO I THINK THIS IS A CONTRACTED. OF WITH THE WITH THE ORGANIZATION SO. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE INSTITUTION IS MISTER BARKER WAS SAYING YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BIG HOUSE STAFF OR TREATING. EVERY INMATE AND EVERY INMATE DESERVES RESPECT- IN COURTESY. OF BEING ADDRESSED WHO THE FEELING ARE WE ALL WE ALL ARE HUMAN BEINGS. I THINK THAT REALLY CAME THROUGH. IN THE TRAINING WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. AND WE ALL BELIEVE IN WHO WE ARE AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TREAT EACH OTHER. I RESPECTFULLY AND WITH DIGNITY ANYTIME WE'RE DEALING WITH ANY INDIVIDUAL- IN THE INSTITUTION OR ANY ANY COURT HEARING BECAUSE IT'S REALLY MAKING EVERYBODY FEEL COMFORTABLE. IN THAT HEARING IF THEY'RE NERVOUS ANYWAY- AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO ADD. TO THEIR DIVISION OF DISCOMFORT SO I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A HEARING WITH ONE TRANSGENDER- SO FAR AND REALLY IT'S ALL ABOUT TALKING TO THE INDIVIDUAL. MAKING THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE READING AREAS WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT THEY DESERVE. AND IT AND IT WENT REALLY WELL. MEASURE YOU OR THAT I APPRECIATED I- YOU KNOW TO- SENATOR COM LOGGERS COMMENTS IT INTO YOURS IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BE INCARCERATED. I TO HAVE YOUR FREEDOMS CURVED AND TAKEN AWAY BUT TO BE SOMEONE FROM. AS ONE COMMISSIONER PUT IT A NONTRADITIONAL COMMUNITY OR ONE THAT IS. NOT IS UNDERSTOOD I WILL JUST SAY IS A MEMBER OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY MYSELF. I FEEL EVERY YEAR OF MY AGE AND EVERY YEAR OF. A CHANGING WORLD AROUND ME THAT I'VE HAD TO LEARN TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL EVEN COMING FROM A COMMUNITY I UNDERSTAND ISSUES OF GENDER NONCONFORMITY AND OTHER THINGS IN LEARNING PRONOUNS AND HOW TO ADDRESS PEOPLE THE WAY THEY WANT TO BE. ADDRESSED IS SOMETHING I'VE HAD TO LEARN AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO MIGHT THINK THAT I WOULD UNDERSTAND THOSE ISSUES COMPLETELY AND I WILL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT I DON'T. BUT I DO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE LIKE ALL COMMUNITIES- THAT THAT THEIR VOICES ARE GOING TOBE HEARD AND THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL. SAFE SO ON BEHALF OF MYCOLLEAGUES WHO WOULD ASK US THAT QUESTION AS THESE MOVE TO THE FLOOR. WE WILL NOW BE ABLE TO ANSWER- WITH SOME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY- I AM GOING TO.

I WOULD LIKE TO THINK MY HUSBAND ROBBER AND MAY TWO AND A HALF YEAR OLD SON GRAVERT THE BILL- FOR THEIR LVE AND PATIENCE AS THEY TAKE ON THIS NEW RESPONSIBILITY. AND I DO HAVE MY HUSBAND WITH ME TODAY. AS PROUD RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF SINGER WE BOTH SEE THE RICHNESS OF THE LAND WE LIVE ON AND THE CHALLENGES WE MUST ALL FALL TOGETHER WHEN IT COMES TO AIR QUALITY. AS A FAMILY OF ASTHMA SUFFERERS WE UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC HEALTH EFFECTS OF REGULATORY BODIES LIKE THIS ONE. AS A CHILD OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS WERE FARMWORKERS AND STILL WORK IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY TODAY. I KNOW THE GREAT VALUE OF THE LAND TO OUR SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY COMMUNITIES. AS A RESEARCHER I HAVE DONE RESEARCH AND POLICY WORK ON THE AFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON PUBLIC HEALTH. I HAVE ALSO HELPED AUTHOR PAPERS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESPIRATORY HEALTH CONDITIONS AIR QUALITY AND SOCIO DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS IN PRETERM INFANTS IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION I AM THE CO DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY HEALTH POLICY INSTITUTE WHICH INCLUDES IN ITS RESEARCH AND EVALUATION PORTFOLIO PROJECTS WITH PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS ON MATTERS OF THE ENVIRONMENT. I SUBDISCIPLINE BECAUSE OF MY DEEP PASSION FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. I AM A COLLABORATOR AND COMMUNICATOR. I ASPIRED TO BRING THE SOLES OF MY ROLE TO HELP PRODUCE SOUND REGULATORY PROGRAMS. TO SOLVE ISSUES THAT PUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AT RISK OF UNHEALTHY AIR. WHILE ALSO PRESERVING THE STRENGTHS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMIES. IF CONFIRMED I AM COMMITTED TO GIVING EVERY STAKEHOLDER VOICE IN HOW WE IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND- QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR ALL VALLEY RESIDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL START THIS TIME WITH- SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WELL YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR EVEN BEING INTERESTED IN WANTING TO SIR HELLO AND THIS IS WITH ZERO COMPENSATION SO. GOUDEAU SISTERS. HI I JUST HAVE TO SAY IN YOUR RESPONSES- THERE WAS SUCH BALANCE IN HONESTY IN THEM AND I REALLY COULD FEEL YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS ABOUT THIS WORK- AND YOUR PLEDGE- IN THIS AREA SO I REALLY EXCITED ABOUT- THIS- CONFIRMATION. YOU KNOW IN MANY OF YOUR RESPONSES THERE WAS THIS VERY THOUGHTFUL INTERFACE BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH BUSINESS AND SUSTAINABILITY RIGHT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REGION IS INELIGIBLE. AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT VALLEY HEALTH IS A PRIORITY YOU KNOW BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OBVIOUSLY- OF THE REGION'S ECONOMY. I THINK ONE OF THE ONE OF THE FOREMOST THINGS IS TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO- GET TO KNOW THE INDUSTRY'S- IN BE THERE AND GET TO KNOW WHAT THEIR OPERATIONS ARE ARE LAKE AND- FOR ME YOU KNOW THOSE FACT FINDING MISSIONS AND- TALKING TO PEOPLE FACE TO FACE IS REALLY ONE OF THE MOST- IMPORTANT ASPECTS. OF WORKING WITH INDUSTRY- I DO THINK THEY AND I HAVE YET TO TALK TO ANYBODY IN AN INDUSTRY THAT SAYS NO WE DON'T WANT CLEAN AIR- BECAUSE WE ALL SHARE THIS COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND SO I DO REALLY THINK SAY- THE BALANCED APPROACH IS JUST ABOUT LISTENING. UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR OPERATIONS ARE AND THEN ALSO APPROACHING THOSE- YOU KNOW LET'S BRING ON OUR PROBLEM SOLVING HATS ON AND REALLY-% ATTACKING THESE PROBLEMS. HEAD ON- KNOWING THAT AND- THERE ARE THERE ARE ISSUES THAT MUST BE RESOLVED. AND THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY. THANK YOU I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION REALLY FOR YOU IT'S ABOUT AB SIX SEVENTEEN AND IT SEEMS LIKE. COMPLYING HAS BEEN KIND OF CHALLENGING AND YET YOU KNOW SOME DIVIDENDS ARE. BEING REVEALED AND JUST WANTED TO KNOW MAYBE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW TO CONTINUE THESE KIND OF REALLY RICH AND IMPORTANT- DISCUSSIONS IN LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT AROUND NOW. AND HOW YOU SEE YOUR VOICE REALLY LENDING ITSELF- TO SOME OF THAT PROGRESS. YES THEY AB SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAM IS DEFINITELY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES TO- WE'LL WORK ON SOMETHING- AND VERY TARGETED COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TOGETHER- TO SOLVE COMPLEX ISSUES WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES- WE JUST APPROVED A- I'M THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR PLAN LAST WEEK- FOR ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES DIE AS- THERE IS AN EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITY. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR ME ONE OF THE KEY ASPECTS TO THIS IS REALLY HOW TO HELP AND BE A VOICE TO ONE MAKE SURE ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITIES REALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. TO UNDERSTAND- COMPLEX ISSUES LIKE LAND USE POLICY THAT ARE THAT IMPLICATE THEIR PLANS- BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE TECHNICAL TERMS OF HOW I AM THE FEASIBILITY OF ERROR MONITORING AND WHAT KIND OF OUR MONETARY- IS NECESSARY. I TOOK OUT A FACT- I DO SEE THAT MY ROLE WITHIN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- BOARD IS ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT I BRING UP CONCERNS I COMMUNITY BRING TO ME TO THE STAFF TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THAT DISTRICT AND WORK WITH THEM TO- TO IMPROVE THAT- THAT PROCESS I THINK THEY- I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE FACT THAT THIS DISTRICT NOW HAS THREE PLANS UNDER ITS BELT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE- DESIRE TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY AND TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL. A PROGRAM WITHIN THIS AIR DISTRICT AND I KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN CONTINUOUS LEARNING MODE SO I SEE I REALLY SEE MY ROLE AS BEING THAT THAT PERSON THAT IS ABLE TO HELP PROBLEM SOLVE WITH THEIR DISTRICT HOW WE MAKE THESE PROGRAMS IN THESE COMMUNITY STRONGER AND THEN HOW WE ADVOCATE FOR MORE RESOURCES FOR THESE NEW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE COMING ON BUT DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ALLOTTED TO THEM- IN THIS NEW- BUDGET BUT THAT STILL. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL SO- I SEE THOSE DUAL ROLES AND IF WITH IT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT PROGRAM. GREAT THANK YOU OF COURSE THE TEASER IS THAT YOUR CAR MEMBER BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BUT I REALLY WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST- SERVICE YES. OKAY SENATOR GROWTH. ON THE INTERNET THANK YOU ARE MADAM PRO TEM A- MISS PARTICULAR GOVERNOR OR DOCTOR PARTICULAR WARNER- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT WITH ME YESTERDAY. I AGAIN ECHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES COMMENTS ABOUT BEING THOUGHTFUL EVERY RESPONSE YOU GAVE ME WAS THOUGHTFUL AND I BELIEVE TRULY SINCERE- WITH THE INFORMATION THAT YOU GAVE ME. I SHARED- QUITE A BIT OF MY CONCERNS THAT I HAVE- I KNOW THAT- THERE ARE A FEW OF US THAT REPRESENT AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HEALTH IS A SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- BUT- THERE'S ALSO A FOOD SUPPLY ISSUE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ARMS THE THREE COUNTIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FRESNO TULARE AND- KERN. YOU HAVE THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD NOT IN THE STATE OR THE NATION BUT IN THE WORLD. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT DATA- IN CALIFORNIA ALONE- ALMONDS ARTICHOKES DATES- GRAPES RAISINS FIGS MELONS JUST TO NAME A FEW THE CITRUS CROP. ALMOST AS IF HE'S WITH NOT THE CITRUS CROP. THE 99% OF THOSE COMMODITIES COME FROM CALIFORNIA. AS I KNOW THAT FARMERS ARE WORKING EVERY DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MITIGATE- AIR ISSUES. I HAVE BEEN I HAVE A HUGE CONCERN ABOUT SOME OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THAT CALL MY OFFICE AND THEY COME INTO MY OFFICE AND THAT I HAVE- MEETINGS WITH. ABOUT BEING REGULATED AND FIND OUT OF THE FOOD PRODUCING INDUSTRY. I KNOW THAT I SERVE WITH PEOPLE UP HERE IN THIS BUILDING THAT WANT TO- FELLOW ALMOST EVERY BIT OF LAND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT THAT'S WHERE FOOD COMES FROM AND- SO I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS YOU HAVE THAT HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT AND GIVE YOU SOME MORE NUMBERS 85% THE CARROT SUPPLY COMES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AT LARGEST BABY CARE PRINT AT PRODUCER AT LARGEST ANY BABY CARE AT THE TV AT LARGEST BABY CARE PRODUCER LARGEST A REASON PRODUCER LARGEST AT TABLE GRAPE GROWER LARGEST BLUEBERRY GROWER IN THE WORLD. I MEAN THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE ALL LIKE IN OUR LIVES NOT JUST AT. THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE JOB SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS- JUST TO REITERATE WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BALANCE- BALANCE THE REGULATORY PROCESS WITH INDIVIDUALS- THAT ARE ACTUALLY PRODUCING OUR FOOD. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE I AM. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS FOR ME HAS REALLY BEEN TO UNDERSTAND- HOW THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY WORKS- AND TO THAT EXTENT I HAVE SPENT SOME TIME AND I HOPE TO SPEND EVEN MORE TIME AND GETTING TO REALLY KNOW AND SPEAK TO YOU THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY UP AND DOWN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- ONE OF THE- THE KEY ASPECTS HERE IS THAT. WHEN WE HAVE RULES OR ARE IN THE RULE MAKING PROCESS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO EVERY STAKEHOLDER GETS OF WASTE AND THAT WE REALLY- MAKE SURE THAT THE CHANGES THAT WE PROPOSE ARE PRACTICAL AND THAT IF- IF CERTAIN- DISPROPORTIONATE HARM IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU LET'S SEE A SMALL FARMER FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT WITH THE INCENTIVES NECESSARY TO TRANSITION- THAT BUSINESS PERSON INTO- BEING IN COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO PROPOSE SO I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK THAT. I AM IN THIS POSITION TO- DRIVE ANYONE OUT OF BUSINESS HOWEVER I DO THINK FAYE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS STRUCK ME SO MUCH AS I'VE MET FARMERS- FROM- FRESNO COUNTY IS THAT THEY'RE PROBLEM SOLVERS AND THEY WANT TO PROBLEM SOLVE WITH US. AND SO MY GOAL IS REALLY TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AND- AND THAT WE ALSO WHEN RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE OR WHEN THEY'RE NEEDED TO HELP TRANSITION SOMEONE INTO COMPLIANCE THAT WE WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR STAT LEGISLATURE WITH OUR STATE REGULATORY IN AGENCY- WHICH IS CARB AND- WHAT I'M PUSHING FOR IS MUCH MORE COLLABORATION WITH OTHER- REGULATORY BODIES- SO THAT WE ALL TOGETHER REALLY- GARNER THOSE RESOURCES NECESSARY. TO TRANSITION- THIS INDUSTRY AS NEEDED- AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING STATEMENT I REALLY DO HAVE A LOVE FOR THE LAND INTO RESPECT- MY GRANDPARENTS WERE FARMERS AND- I THINK IT'S AN ADDITION TO MY PARENTS COMING TO THIS COUNTRY BEING FARMWORKERS. SO I DEFINITELY THINK FAYE- I AM SOMEONE THAT SEES THE VALUE IN IT AND I KNOW THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO SOLVE THESE COMPLEX PROBLEMS TOGETHER. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT COMMENT AND WHERE DO YOU SEE A CARBON CREDIT SUPPLYING TO AGRICULTURE AND WILL PERMANENT CROPS LIKE ALMONDS PISTACHIOS AND CITRUS BE GIVING CREDITS. I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S EVIDENT SHOWS THAT EVERY TREE THAT'S PLANTED- PARTICIPATES IN- CARBON REDUCTIONS SO ARE THERE GOING TO BE A CARD YOU SEE CARBON CREDITS BEING APPLIED TO AGRICULTURE. THANK YOU CENTER WHILE THE ISSUE OF ESTABLISHING KERR BAKER CARBON CREDITS TO AGRICULTURE. FALLS WITHIN OTHER REGULATORY BODIES RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF THE SGV AND CONTROL DISTRICT SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. I CAN SAY THAT IF PROGRAMS ARE ESTABLISHED IN A WAY THAT ADVANCES OUR GOALS OF IN YOUR FACE OUT OF AGRICULTURAL BURNING WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN YOUR WAY. AND IF THOSE PROGRAMS- YOU KNOW PROMOTE THE OVERALL USE OF MORE SUSTAINABLE METHODS OF FARMING THAT REDUCE AIR POLLUTION. WITHOUT DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING SOME COMMUNITIES OVER OTHERS. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD USE EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX NECESSARY TO- SHE TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS OF YEAR PHASE OUT ACT BERNIE AND THE USE OF MORE SUSTAINABLE METHODS OF FARMING SO. IF IT DOES THESE THINGS- I WOULD BE IN SUPPORT WHILE IT IS NOT WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THIS PARTICULAR DISTRICT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR AGAIN FOR THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT WITH ME YESTERDAY. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR- OKAY GO AHEAD OKAY I'M SORRY AND I AM GOING TO KEEP YOU TO YOUR COMMITMENT TO LET ME GIVE YOU A TOUR OF KERN COUNTY. ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY. IT'S NOT A FAR DRIVE FROM SANGER I DON'T. I'M SORRY- YEAH SENATOR BATES GO AHEAD THANK YOU. ALSO A PLACE HERE ONLINE RIGHT THAT. THANK I'M OKAY I'M SORRY THANK YOU NUMBER TEN THANK YOU DR PACHECO LEARNER ON VERY VERY PLEASED WITH YOUR ANSWERS TO THE MANY QUESTIONS SO I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC ONE FOR YOU I DO HAVE A STATEMENT TO SAY THANK YOU ALFA CENTER CON LONGER MENTIONED IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU ARE IF NOT YOU ARE A VOLUNTEER IN THIS- IN THIS BUSINESS AND- IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY HEAVY JOB TO BALANCE THE INTERESTS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT COMPETING OUT THERE SO WHAT PHONE SHOULD BE LIKE YOU HAVE ANSWERED IT. REALLY TO THE MINUTE- TO THE LETTER OF WHAT I WOULD AFFECT HOW YOU WERE EDUCATING YOURSELF APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE DOING ON FIGHT- YOU KNOW OPEN UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL REVIEW OF THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND. CERTAINLY OUT BALANCING THAT WITH OUR- GAS AND- OIL PRODUCTION BECAUSE ALTHOUGH OF THOSE CERTAINLY AFTER INTO OF. AWFUL OUR CERTAINLY FOR OUR STATE FOR THOSE THESE COMMUNITIES FOR OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. I WISH YOU WELL IF YOU GO FORWARD AND I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES- CENTER LAYER THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU TOOK US TO MEET WITH ME AND WE FREQUENTLY ASKED FOR REPORT BACKS AFTER HEARING SOME SO TEMPTED TO GET A REPORT BACK ON YOUR HERE-YOUR TOUR OF KERN COUNTY. YEAH I THINK IT WILL BE OF GREAT INTEREST TO THE REST OF US HARM. THE THING I THOUGHT I'D FOLLOW UP IS- I THANK SENATORS CALM LONGER AND GROWTH DID A GOOD JOB OF DRAWING YOU OUT ABOUT SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES WITH PEOPLE. AND EDUCATING YOURSELF ORNISH'S BUT WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. THIS BOARD WAS DEADLOCKED R. A. N. D. SENATOR REGULAR CARRIED A BILL TO ADD A POSITION TO THE BOARD. THAT WAS A PUBLIC POSITION TO TRY TO DEAL WITH WITH GETTING THE BOARD MEMBERS TO WORK TOGETHER. AND YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN OUR MEETING AND THEN. THAT'S WHERE I THOUGHT I'D I TAKE IT IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER SANDERS IS. HOW DO YOU USE YOUR SKILLS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH OTHER BOARD MEMBERS TO TRY TO ACHIEVE OUTCOMES. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO PROCEED ON THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THAT SPLIT STILL EXISTS AMONG MEMBERS OF THE BOARD. YES ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT IT REALLY- YOU KNOW FOR ME THE WAY THAT I APPROACH ANY RELATIONSHIP IS. IS FROM A FROM A STARTING PLACE OF COMMONALITIES RATHER THAN DIFFERENCES. AND I DO THINK THAT OUR SHARED- PASSION FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- IS WHERE I START WITH MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS- I WILL SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THE DYNAMIC- WITH THIS AIR DISTRICT IS NOT JUST OF THE BOARD IT'S ALSO WITH OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND I THINK THAT HE'S DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE- POLICIES AND MOVE FORWARD POLICIES THAT THAT REALLY- ARE GOING TO BE- THINGS THAT THAT THE ENTIRE BOARD CAN REALLY- CAN REALLY SUPPORT. AND I WILL HAVE TO SAY THAT- EVEN AS A AS I MENTIONED TO YOU SENATOR EVEN LAST WEEK WE APPROVED MORE RESOURCES FOR THE EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITIES. AND MORE. AT OUT POSITIONS FOR- PEOPLE THAT ARE MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKING AND I THINK THAT THAT THE FACT THAT THAT THAT- RESEARCH THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCE PASSED UNANIMOUSLY REALLY SPEAKS TO HOW AS A GROUP WE ARE LOOKING TO HOW TO SOLVE THESE COMPLEX ISSUES TOGETHER- ONE OF THE THINGS IN TERMS OF WHEN WE DON'T AGREE ON SOMETHING- I THINK THEY- I HAVE. I HAVE TRIED TO INVEST MORE TIME AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT SINCE WE ARE- IN ASSUMING FIREMEN'S I REALLY HAVE TRIED TO SPEND TIME GETTING TO KNOW MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS- BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT RELATIONSHIPS MATTER. WHEN IT COMES TO THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO A WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING A MEETING- MY APPROACH IS REALLY- FOR ME ALWAYS- KEEPING TRUE TO MY INTEGRITY IN TERMS OF. OF WHAT I KNOW AND I THINK THAT MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS EVEN WHEN WE HAVE DISAGREED. BECAUSE THEY KNOW I AM COMING FROM A PLACE WHERE I HAVE I HAVE I'M SPEAKING TO MY VALUES AND MY PERSPECTIVE AND THEY'RE SPEAKING TO THERE'S- I THINK WE CAN STILL WE STILL APPRECIATE EACH OTHER AT THE END OF THE DAY BECAUSE- WE ARE BOTH APPROACHING FROM THAT LEVEL OF INTEGRITY- AND SO I DO THINK THEY- IT IS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE- YES WE DO HAVE. MANY VARIED- POLITICAL VIEWS AND DEFINITELY- DIFFERENT- VISIONS OF HOW POLICY SHOULD BE- LOOK AT BUT I DO THINK THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY ARE COMMON- PASSION FOR THE VALLEY ALONG WITH- AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHO'S TRYING TO BRING PROGRAMS THAT. THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE AND REALLY- I CAN ADVANCE OUR AIR QUALITY GOALS WHILE I'M- RESERVING SOME OF THAT ATTENTION TO OUR BUSINESSES- HAS HELPED WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP ON THE BOARD AND I DO HOPE THAT ONCE I THE PANDEMIC IS- IS BEHIND US AND WE ARE ABLE TO DO MORE IN PERSON ACTIVITIES. TO GET IT TO CONTINUE TO KNOW MORE OF MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS AS WELL.
