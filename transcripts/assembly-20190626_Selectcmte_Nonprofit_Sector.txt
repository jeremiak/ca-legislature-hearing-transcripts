AHEAD AND WE WILL START TO OUR HEARING TODAY -- FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE NONPROFIT SECTOR ON WEDNESDAY JUNE TWENTY SIX WE HAVE A COMMITTEE TITLED NONPROFITS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS. A AND I WILL START THE HEARING AND SAY THAT I I THINK EVERYONE FOR JOINING US TODAY AS WE EXPLORE THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN NONPROFITS AND STATE GOVERNMENT. THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE NONPROFIT SECTOR WAS FORM TO INCREASE AWARENESS BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE ROLE THAT NON PROFITS PLAY IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. MY GOAL FOR THIS COMMITTEE IS TO COLLABORATE ON STRATEGIES POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON THE INTERSECTION OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL BEING FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. THE GOAL OF THIS HEARING IS TO LOOK AT BEEN NEUTRAL PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN STATE GOVERNMENT AND NON PROFITS IN PROVIDING CRITICAL SERVICES AS WELL AS DISCUSSING THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES MOVING FORWARD. CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE TRUSTED INSTITUTIONS THAT EXISTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE NEEDY UNWINNABLE. IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE EXPRESS COMMUNITY VALUES AND PROMOTE SOCIAL CHANGE. CALIFORNIA'S COUNTY THESE NONPROFIT THAT CALIFORNIA'S COUNT ON OUR NON PROFITS EVERY DAY. THEY INCLUDE HOMELESS SHELTERS CHILD CARE CENTERS FOOD BANKS AND THEY RELY ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. THE STATE USES NONPROFITS AS COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS TO ENHANCE SERVICES AND FILL IMPORTANT GAPS I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR PANELISTS TODAY AND WOULD INVITE THE FIRST PANEL -- TO PLEASE COME FORWARD WE HAVE AYE CHEN NOT TO LOCASCIO THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NONPROFITS ELIZABETH GONZALEZ ASSISTANT CHIEF STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE OFFICER -- AUDITS DIVISION AND AND THE VEAL BERNIE YEAH DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU WELCOME. GOOD MORNING I WILL GO AHEAD AND HAVE YOU ALL I BEGIN I THINK WE'RE GOING. TO BEGIN WITH. IS IT GONNA BE. CHANDAN. YES PERFECT. A LITTLE BIT BUT THANK YOU HI A GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR SO MUCH FOR INVITING US IN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND ESPECIALLY OF COURSE SIDE YOU KNOW THIS SEC CHAIRMAN LIMON THAT DOWN. I HOW MUCH THE COMMITTEE AND YOU YOURSELF HAVE DONE FOR NONPROFIT COMMUNITY SO WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND I IN PARTICULAR THE BILL THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR TOGETHER AB. TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO WHICH YOU CAN HEAR MORE ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ALLOWING NON PROFITS BETTER ACCESS FOR APPLYING FOR STATE GRANTS -- SO YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY -- FITTING TODAY THAT YOU'RE TAKING THIS TIME TO DO A HEARING ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND NON PROFITS BECAUSE IT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE NONPROFIT SECTOR -- AND GOVERNMENT AND IN FACT AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW ONE IN EVERY FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA JOBS AT A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. THAT'S MORE JOBS AND THERE ARE STATEWIDE IN CONSTRUCTION MORE THAN REAL ESTATE MORE THAN AND FINANCE. IN ADDITION MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY WE BRING FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS INTO CALIFORNIA FROM OUT OF STATE AND A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL MONEY -- GRANTS FROM OUT OF STATE FOUNDATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PEOPLE THAT DONATE MONEY TO THE MANY NONPROFITS THAT HAVE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP ROLES AS WELL AS FOR THE WORK THEY DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO YOU KNOW WE NON PROFITS OF COURSE HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT EVERYBODY KNOWS THEIR CHURCH EVERYBODY KNOWS THE GIRL SCOUTS THE UNIVERSITY THE MUSEUM THE ANIMAL SHELTER. FUEL FOOD BANK AND THE AND THE WIKIPEDIA BUT THEY SELDOM THINK OF ALL OF THESE AS SORT OF BEING PART OF ONE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY. SARCHIE POINT TODAY'S THIS GOVERNMENT RELIES ON NON PROFITS TO DELIVER SERVICES. AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE ONE THIRD OF ALL MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES ARE DELIVERED BY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WE DON'T DELIVER SERVICES AROUND THE MARGINS WE ARE IN FACT AT THE CORE OF THIS DELIVERY. AND IN TURN NONPROFIT STATE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE THE FUNDS THAT MAKE THOSE SERVICES POSSIBLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE NONPROFIT SECTOR AS A WHOLE OF FROM ALL THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT PUT TOGETHER. SO THIS GOVERNMENT NONPROFIT PARTNERSHIP ISN'T JUST KIND OF A LITTLE DEAL IT'S LIKE A REALLY BIG DEAL THAT'S AT THE CORE OF HOW CALIFORNIA DELIVER SERVICES TO ITS COMMUNITIES. SO WHAT ARE THE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THAT FUND NON PROFITS AND HOW DOES THE MONEY FLOW WELL FIRST SOME FEDERAL MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO NON PROFITS FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH HIDE. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THE DEPARTED MARK DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR AND OTHERS. SOME FEDERAL MONEY GOES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH THEN WE GRANT SOME OF IT TO NON PROFITS. CALIFORNIA ALSO USES THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND TO FUND SERVICES TO NON PROFITS IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED STATE AGENCIES AND SUB AGENCIES THAT GIVE GRANTS AND CONTRACTS AND NON PROFITS. WE SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ALMOST ALL UNIVERSALLY FINDING IS NOT MADE AS A GRANT TO AN ORGANIZATION'S IT'S MADE FOR DELIVERY OF SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE PAYMENT FOR PER HOUR FOR THERAPY FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. PAYMENT FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TREATED FOR TB PAYMENT FOR THE NUMBER OF BAD NIGHTS IN A WHAT BATTERED WOMEN'S SHELTER OR THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. I AS WELL AS FOR EXAMPLE PAYMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WERE IN RESIDENTIAL PLACES OR WHO ARE RECEIVING -- AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. FISH AND WILDLIFE FUNDS NONPROFITS AS PARTNERS AND FRESH WATER PRESERVATION AND MARSHLAND CLEAN UP CAL FIRE FUNDS NONPROFITS AS PARTNERS AND FIRE PREVENTION. THE DEVELOP DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES IN THE NONPROFIT REGIONAL CENTERS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. ARE SO INTIMATELY INTO INTER TWINED -- THAT WOULD BE HARD TO EVER PULL THEM APART I AM DEEP THERE SO THEY WORK SO CLOSELY TOGETHER IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS -- WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF PREPARING OUR SECOND ANNUAL A SECOND I ANNUAL SECOND ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR WHICH WILL BE READY IN THE FALL BUT WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME SNEAK PREVIEW INFO. US SO FIRST OUR GOVERNMENT FUNDS DISTRIBUTED EVENLY AMONG THE ABOUT THE STATE WELL OUR RESEARCH SHOWS PROFOUND THIS THIS DISPARITIES. IF WE EXCLUDE FOR THE MOMENT HOSPITALS AND UNIVERSITIES FOR THE FROM THE EQUATION IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHICH IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACIST DISTRICT TO US ON THIS COMMITTEE. HAS 11% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION BUT ONLY 6% OF GOVERNMENT FUNDING. AND WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES TO THESE NON PROFITS FUND ART SORRY DO THESE FUNDS FUND -- WELL ABOUT 80% OF GOVERNMENT REVENUES GOES TO HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH IN ONE KIND OR ANOTHER -- BUT IT GOES TO ALL KINDS OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL. SO WHY DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR GOVERNMENT AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO FUND NON PROFITS TO DO SERVICES RATHER THAN THAN DELIVERING THEM DIRECTLY THEMSELVES BUT HERE JUST A FEW REASONS FIRSTOF ALL. IN THE AREA OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES MANY PEOPLE WHO NEED TESTING AND TREATMENT FOR CONTAGIOUS DISEASES SUCH AS TB AIDS AND HEPATITIS. CAN BE REACHED BETTER BY THE NON PROFITS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. THEY DON'T THESE NONPROFITS DON'T HAVE THE INTIMIDATING STAMP OF GOVERNMENT THERE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY IN TUNE WITH THE WITH THAT COMMUNITIES. AND THEIR PERCEIVED IS TRULY FRIENDLY AND AND COMMUNITY BASED. SECONDLY NONPROFITS ARE INNOVATIVE AND SERVICES NOT JUST DELIVERS OF SERVICE JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE. NOW THAT. TWENTY YEARS AGO OR THIRTY YEARS AGO IT WASN'T THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES COULD ATTEND MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS COULD HAVE MAINSTREAM JOBS ARE COULD VISIT MAINSTREAM PARKS. NOW WE KNOW THAT ALL THOSE THINGS HAPPEN IN LARGE PART BECAUSE NONPROFITS EXPERIMENTED WITH AND ADVOCATED FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF SERVICES AND FOR A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THIRD NONPROFITS CAN MOBILIZE VOLUNTEERS RAISE MONEY AND OUR NUMBER THAN GOVERNMENT. THESE ARE ASPECTS OF SOMETIMES MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO OUR WORK AND A MODESTLY LOWER COST. SO TO BRING THIS TO LIFE I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT JUST ONE NONPROFIT -- IN THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NON PROFITS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE PAID STAFF. AND THAT IS TO HIT THE CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES WHICH IS LOCATED IN MODESTO A NONPROFIT WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED STAFF PROVIDING AS RANGE OF SERVICES THROUGHOUT STANISLAUS COUNTY. AND THE NEXT TIME YOU DRIVE INTO MODESTO YOU'LL SEE THEIR BIG SIGN ON THEIR BUILDING BECAUSE THE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS YOU DRIVE IN THEY SERVE MORE THAN. TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE INCLUDING MOSTLY CHILDREN EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SO HOW DID THEY DO THIS WORK WELL FIRST THEY USE PROP SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. FOR EARLY INTERVENTION WITH TROUBLED FAMILIES THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES SEE SOME OF THE CRUCIAL PARTNER AND FINDS THEM AS THEY TRAFFIC AND SUPPORT SUPPORT IN VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THEY HAVE A CASE MANAGER EMBEDDED IN HIGH RISK JUVENILE PROBATION THAT SUPPORTS GIRLS ON PROBATION AND HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS THROUGH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT KNOWS THAT THIS WERE COULD NOT BE DONE IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND THE CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES. MODESTO CITY SCHOOLS PROVIDES HIM PROVIDES FAMILY SERVICES THROUGH THE CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES AT ELEVEN DIFFERENT SCHOOLS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE HIGH ABSENT SCHOOL FOR HAVE HIGH ABSENTEE AND OTHER KINDS OF BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. THEY CAN'T STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS REFUGEES THROUGH CAL NEW PROGRAM. THROUGH SORRY THROUGH CAL NEW FUNDING -- THE MODESTO CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES ALSO RECEIVES FUNDING FROM THE OFFICE OF CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION TO HELP. THAT PROVIDES HOME VISITING PROGRAM FOR FIRST TIME MOTHERS WHO HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES AND I'M SURE I LEFT OUT SOMETHING THEY DO. BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT ALL OF THESE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES RELY ON THE CENTER TO PROVIDE SERVICES. AND IN TURN THE CENTERS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE WITH THE GOALS AND THE MECHANISMS AND THE STRATEGIES THEIR GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. AS PART OF OUR SOON TO BE RESET RESET RELEASED RESEARCH WE ALSO CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED NONPROFIT LEADERS. AND THEY GAVE US SOME IDEAS ON WHAT WOULD HELP STRENGTHEN THEIR PARTNERSHIP WITH GOVERNMENT. PROBLEM NUMBER 160% OF NON PROFITS TO RECEIVE FUNDING NOTE THAT THEY DO NOT RECEIVE A SUFFICIENT PAYMENTS TO COVER THE FULL COST OF THE WORK THAT IS BEING CONTRACTED. FOR AN URBAN INSTITUTE REPORT FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN SAYS THAT TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA NONPROFITS HAVE INDIRECT COSTS RATES OF LESS THAN 10% WHICH WAS REFLECTED ON OUR SURVEY IT WITH THAT SHOWED 50% THAT SHOWED FEDERAL COST RATES BE AN AVERAGE OF NINE POINT 8%. STATE RATES EIGHT POINT TWO AND COUNTY AND CITY RATES 8%. HOW 8% OVERHEAD MIGHT SOUND KIND OF HIGH BUT WHEN YOU REMEMBER THAT THE FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES AND SERVICES AGENCIES? USE AS A STANDARD 35% IN OVERHEAD HE BREAKS YOU REALIZE HOW LO THESE INDIRECT COSTS RATES ARE. IN THE FOR PROFIT WORLD LARGE RETAILERS KNOW THEY HAVE A STAKE IN HAVING STRONG SUPPLY CHAINS THAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR SUPPLIERS FAIRLY SO THAT THEY ARE NOT PRESSURED TO CUT QUALITY OR UNDER PAY THEIR WORKERS. CALIFORNIA NON PROFITS ARE A KEY PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT AND CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT HAS A HUGE STAKE IN MAINTAINING A STRONG ECOSYSTEM IN THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY. SECOND PROBLEM NONPROFITS FREQUENTLY REPORT THAT PAYMENT RATES CAN GO UNCHANGED FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. IN AREAS SUCH AS THE REIMBURSEMENT COSTS FOR MEALS DELIVERED TO ISOLATED SENIORS ARE FOR TESTING AND PHYSICAL THERAPY FOR PEACE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS GOES UP THESE RATES -- SIMPLY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO ON NONPROFITS WORK HARD AT RAISING PRIVATE MONEY FROM FOUNDATIONS AND FROM INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE UP THE GAP. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT HOWEVER IS IT MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR THEM TO GROW. THEIR GOVERNMENT AGENCY COULD BE SAYING WE WANT A DOUBLE THE FUNDING WE GIVE YOU SO THAT YOU CAN DOUBLE THE SERVICES YOU'RE PROVIDING. BUT THE NONPROFIT IS SAYING BUT WE HAVE TO RAISE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO DO THIS WORK TO CLOSE THAT GAP. I'M NOT SURE WE CAN RAISE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO IN EFFECT THE ISSUE OF UNDER PAYMENT AND LOW AND OTHER NO TURN OVER AND RATES. MEANS IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR ALL OF US TO GROW SERVICES ONE MASS PROBLEM I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT 44% OF NONPROFIT SAY THAT LATE PAYMENTS ARE EITHER A MODERATE OR SEVERE PROGRAM. PROBLEM IN FACT -- COMMUNITY NON PROFITS ARE IN EFFECT LOANING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT TO STATE GOVERNMENT. SO AS YOU CAN SEE JUST AS CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT HAS A STAKE IN ENSURING THAT THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN THE TECHNOLOGY OR HEALTHY AND STRONG. GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS A STAKE IN ENSURING THAT THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY IS A HEALTHY KIDS HEALTHY AND ABLE TO PARTNER WELL WITH GOVERNMENT. SO THIS PARTNERSHIP. REST IS WHERE THE LIVES OF OUR COMMUNITIES RESTS WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT STRONGER. THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TODAY. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING ALL OF THAT REALLY GOOD INFORMATION THE DATA I THINK THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING -- I'M A LITTLE BIT GONZALEZ -- SYSTEM TO PUT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE DIVISION ABOUT IT THEN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING. ME HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTROLLERS ROLE AND ASSISTING THE NONPROFITS AND GETTING THEIR FUNDING YOU KNOW THERE -- CLAIMS PAID SUCH AS AND TENER GENERAL OVERVIEW THE STATE COMPTROLLER AND HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO AUDIT -- CLAIMS THAT ARE RECEIVED FOR A PAYMENT WE LOOK FOR THE LEGALITY VALIDITY AND PROPRIETY OF THE LAME -- WE PROCESS CLAIMS VIA PAPER CLAIMS SCHEDULES AS WELL AS VIA DISCOUNT VOUCHERS -- PAPER CLAIMS SCHEDULES WEEKEND WE RECEIVE UP TO LIKE NINETY NINE PAY EASE AND ONE CLAIM SCHEDULED VOUCHERS ARE NOW ONE PAGE EIGHTY PROVIDES HER -- WHAT WE LOOK FOR AS FAR AS IN THE NON PROFITS -- WE CAN ONLY GO TO THE CONTRACT OR GRANT THAT IS PROVIDED TO US AHEAD OF A MAKING ANY PAYMENTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT IT TOO WE WE LOOK. FOR YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT -- THE WHAT'S BEING REQUESTED IS IN THERE SO I KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AND DIRECT -- COSTS BETWEEN -- A CONCERN. AS FAR AS AS LONG AS IT'S ALLOWED IN THE CONTRACTOR IN THE GRANT AGREEMENT WE WILL -- APPROVE THAT. YEAH AND THEN -- WE ALSO THE NON FOR PROFITS THEY FALL INTO THE PUMP PAYMENT ACT. WHICH ALLOWS OF WHAT WE HAVE TO APPROVE A PAYMENT THE STATE HAS TO APPROVE A VALID. PAYMENT AND FORTY FIVE DAYS AND GENERALLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS THIRTY DAYS AND THEN WE AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HAVE FIFTEEN DAYS. TO AUDIT THE PAYMENT AND IF IT'S A VALID PAYMENT -- ISSUE THE WARRANT -- AS FAR I MEAN THAT'S KIND IN GENERAL WHAT WE DO THIS IN THE AUDIT SHOP FOR NONPROFIT SO IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. WE'LL GO TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER I'M TRYING TO PICK UP THE CLOSER. TO THEIR HELP. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PRESENTATION. GREAT WELL MY NAME IS ANNABELLE FUNNY I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU AT THE STATE LIBRARY -- AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING US HERE -- SO -- WE'RE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT A NEW PROJECT THAT IS -- HAPPENING BECAUSE OF YOU SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIMPLY MEMBER -- SO IT IS ONE WEBSITE FOR ALL STATE OF CALIFORNIA GRANT OPPORTUNITIES SO -- THAT WAS A BILL OF PASSED LAST YEAR HI YOUR BILL AB -- TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO WHICH IS THE GRANT INFORMATION ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO IS GOING. TO RATE FOR THE FIRST TIME A SINGLE PLACE WHERE ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN SEEKING A GRANT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WILL BE ABLE TO GO ON THE WEBSITE AND SEE ALL THE GRANT OPPORTUNITIES AT ANY GIVEN TIME SO -- THIS. IS A STATUTORILY REQUIRED BY JULY -- ONE TWENTY TWENTY THE STATE LIBRARY HAS STARTED THIS WORK -- TO TO STARTING -- THE WORK OF LOOKING INTO THE NEEDS OF ALL THE DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCIES -- EACH STATE AGENCY IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE LIBRARY WITH A SET OF DATA ELEMENTS ON THEIR NUMBER LAID OUT IN THE LEGISLATION. AND A NUMBER THAT WE THINK THAT WILL SERVE IMPLICITLY FALL FROM THOSE THAT WILL NEED IN ORDER TO DO SOME OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER THINGS -- AND AS WE TALK WITH STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS COUNT ON PROFITS -- WE'VE ALSO -- MET -- SO WE MET RECENTLY WITH THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS -- WE MAD WITH KOBE IS TO TRY TO AND TALK TO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOME OF THE BUSINESSES TO APPLY FOR GRANTS. AND JUST STARTING TO GET A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS NEED AND WANT AND THE WEBSITE TO MAKE IT AS USEFUL TO THEM AS POSSIBLE WHEN PEOPLE ARE APPLYING FOR GRANTS -- AND THEN WE'RE ALSO I'M IN THE PROCESS OF MEETING WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF STATE DEPARTMENTS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PROCESS NOW -- AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS -- BUT THAT THEY NEED SO THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY TRANSFER INFORMATION OVER -- AND ELECTRONICALLY THERE WILL BE NO PAPER -- SO THAT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE INFORMATION WILL COME OVER BUT WE DO KNOW IT WILL BE. IT WILL BE IN OUGHT SOME SOMETHING THAT IS A AT LEAST A TO AUTOMATED OPTIONS AND THEN -- POTENTIALLY A FORM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT -- SO AS THE WILL BE PUBLISHING AN ANNUAL REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS -- IN JULY WHEN I JAN ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT WE AT THIS POINT -- LOOKING HOW WE CAN BUILD INTO THE WEBSITE -- A LOT OF THE DATA THAT'S REQUIRED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT SO THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT AND REAL TIME -- IS A LOT OF THE A LOT OF THE INFORMATION IN YOUR REPORT IN TERMS OF HOW MANY FOLKS ARE VISITING WHERE THEY GOING ALL OF THAT WE CAN BUILD THAT INTO THE ANALYTICS SO THAT. WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO SEE THAT -- SO ONE THING WE'VE BEEN REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING -- WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IS THAT -- PARTICULARLY FOR THE STATE AGENCY SIDE MAKING SURE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE -- THEIR APPLICATION PROCESS IT DOESN'T WE ARE NOT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A GRANTS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE STATE BUT IT IS WHAT IS CHANGING IS HOW WE PUBLICIZE GRANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE TO MAKE THAT INFORMATION CLEARER AND MORE STANDARDIZED -- SO I AS I MENTIONED RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING INITIAL MEETINGS WITH USER GROUPS -- WE HAVE AS STARTING JULY FIRST WE WILL HAVE A BUDGET WHICH IS REALLY EXCITING AND ACTUALLY ARE -- AT NEW PROJECT MANAGERS GONNA START ON JULY ONE IS HERE HER NAME IS GIOVANNI BOTH FOR ALAN KEYES BACK THERE -- AND WE WILL BRING HER BY TO MEET YOU VERY SOON. I SO WE ARE. WORKING ON CREATING A PROJECT PLAN -- AND WILL START MEETING WITH EVERYONE VERY SOON -- SO -- THAT WE HOPE TO HAVE AN EARLY PROTOTYPE -- THAT DEVELOPED SO THAT WE'RE GOING WITH THE DATA FROM SOME TEST DEPARTMENTS SO THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE EARLY ON WHAT WORKS AND WHAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE INTEGRATING AND IMPROVING ON BUT WE DO PLAN ON USING A HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN PROCESS AND REALLY MAKING SURE. THAT THIS MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS AND THE EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS -- AND THAT CREATES A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT THAT SERVES THE PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION -- SO WE'D LOVE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS -- AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND SO MAYBE A STAR ACOSTA GO BACKWARDS IN TERMS OF THE ORDER BUT I'LL I'LL START. HERE -- WITH AND IF IT'S OKAY JUST. THIS IS THE YOU KNOW AS I TALK TO PEOPLE THIS IS STILL SOMETHING THAT COMES THAT PEOPLE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR JUST A RESOURCE TO IDENTIFY IT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. I THINK IN LIGHT BECAUSE OF WHAT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MENTIONED BY JAN -- IN TERMS OF THE NEED -- YOU KNOW I I HEARD THAT TO AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU KNOW THAT -- A NONPROFIT CAN GROW IF THEY'RE UNDERPAID -- THAT THE YOU KNOW LATE PAYMENTS HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE NONPROFIT -- AND SO FUNDING ALL BECOMES A BIG NEED BUT HOW DOES THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY. ANTICIPATE -- THEY WILL PARTNER WITH ASSOCIATIONS LIKE HELL NONPROFITS OR OTHERS YOU KNOW ASSOCIATIONS ARE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND PERHAPS IT'S REALLY EARLY. IN THE PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THIS BUT I MEAN I JUST DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF LARGER -- BROADER CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PARTNERSHIP COULD BE LIKE BESIDES THE PHYSICAL -- AND TECHNICAL PART OF GETTING ALL THE INFORMATION IN AND HAVING PEOPLE CLICK ON THE WEBSITE THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH WELL I MEAN I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IS REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND SO THAT YOU KNOW IT'S SO CAL NONPROFITS PUT. TOGETHER AIDS FROM A TASK FORCE OF DIFFERENT NONPROFITS WHO THEY THOUGHT WERE REPRESENTATIVE IN SORT OF SIZE AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND WE DID A VIDEO CONFERENCE WITH THEM I GUESS NOW ABOUT. EVERY TWO MONTHS AGO -- TO START WITH THEM ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT WERE THE BARRIERS THEY WERE FACING -- AND WHAT WERE THE THINGS THEY REALLY WANTED TO SET WE THEY REALLY WANTED TO SEE OUT OF THIS FINISHED PRODUCT SO THAT IT WOULD MEET THEIR NEEDS -- AND SO THAT'S I THINK WE'RE WE'VE REALLY BEEN STARTING IS BUILDING THAT RELATIONSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN GET DONE BY JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THE LONG WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LONG TERM. GOALS THAT WE KNOW AND THERE MAY BE FIRST SIR I KNOW CHEN I'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DATA THAT THEY'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN GETTING WE DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE COLLECT THAT RIGHT NOW -- AND SO THEN HOW DO WE IDENTIFY THAT AND THEN POTENTIALLY BUILD ON THE PROCESS OF IS THAT IS THAT DATA THAT WE WANT TO START COLLECTING -- TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT MORE AVAILABLE SO -- DOES THAT THAT IS YOUR QUESTION YEAH IT DOESN'T HAVE TO TO SOME EXTENT GREAT OKAY THANK YOU. AND THE FOR THE AUDITOR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YET YOU DESCRIBED IT IS THE PROCESS A KIND OF COLLECTING INFORMATION AND ASSESSING IT. DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO STRENGTHEN. THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN. AS THE STATE AND THE NON PROFITS -- JUST. GENERALLY SPEAKING I MEAN I KNOW THAT THEIR ROLE IS TO REALLY LOOK AT ENSURING THAT COMPLIANCE IN THAT ENSURING -- YOU KNOW BUT I AM GET AT AND MAYBE I'M WRONG BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WHEN YOU SEE. THE PROCESS. WHEN YOU IDENTIFY SOME OF THE ELEMENTS THAT MIGHT NOT BE WORKING PERHAPS YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON THINGS THAT CAN STRENGTHEN THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND NONPROFIT -- AS FAR AS FOR THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE BECAUSE THERE IS THE ROLE FROM THE THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS THE ROLE BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE PROVIDING THE CLAIM SCHEDULED TO US -- AND SO. I WOULD SAY IT'S MORE ON THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE CLAIM SCHEDULE PROVIDE IT TO US IS ACCURATE. AND AS FOLLOWS THE THE CONTRACTS IN THE GRANT AGREEMENT BECAUSE THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE THOUGHT IT. TOO WE'RE NOT SETTING POLICY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE'RE JUST LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PAYMENTS THAT WERE PAIN -- FALL UNDER THAT GRANT AGREEMENT OR THE CONTRACT. AND ARE THERE ANYTHING FROM. FROM YOUR ANALYSIS OF WHETHER THE PAYMENTS FOLLOW THE GRANT CONTRACTS ARE. FROM THAT ANALYSIS ARE THERE ANY TAKE AWAYS THAT YOU THINK COULD BE HELPFUL FOR LEGISLATIVE BODY. TO THINK ABOUT -- AGAIN OR MAYBE THEY WERE THE THE MAYBE A RECOMMENDATION WAS NOT THE RIGHT WORD BUT AT ANY TAKE AWAYS FROM ELEMENTS THAT YOU SEE ARE THERE ANY TRENDS OR PATTERNS THAT YOU SEE. THAT TEND TO BE -- THAT TEND TO COME UP MORE OFTEN -- I WOULD. I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK BUT THE STAFF THERE TO SEE IF THERE'S A A TREND USUALLY IT'S JUST INFORMATION THAT'S MISSING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO THEN OBTAIN AND PROVIDE IT AND THEN WE SUBMIT THE CLAIM SCHEDULE. GREAT THANK YOU AND I AM SORRY. I WOULD HAVE. TO AGREE WITH THAT POINT THAT THE IT THE THE ISSUES TEND TO STEM FROM THE CONTRACT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF HOW THE CONTRACT IS WRITTEN. I'M AND SECONDLY FROM HOW IT'S PROCESSED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENTS BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. ON THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM NOT THE BOTTLE NECK I SHOULD SAY. BACK WHEN I WAS A NONPROFIT CFO I USED TO THREATEN ALL THE TIME TO HAVE TO I WOULD SET UP A PUP TENT -- AND ON THE IN DIFFERENT AGENCIES UNTIL LATE WE WE GET OUR PAYMENT SO THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER SINCE THEN WITH THE PROBLEM PAYMENTS ACT BUT IT'S A IT'S IT'S AT THE AGENCIES IN THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE CONTACT FOR THE AGENCIES THROUGH THE STATE LIBRARY. WELL I THINK ALSO EVENTUALLY TURN INTO PARTNERHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT CAN HELP STREAMLINE THAT. THANK YOU AND HAVE. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA OF HOW MANY GRANT AGREEMENTS CAP OVERHEAD. ALTHOUGH NO WE DON'T OKAY THAT'S ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE DON'T KNOW OKAY WE DO KNOW WE YOU KNOW WE CAN TRACK A PARTICULAR BILL FOR EXAMPLE BUT IN A AND CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR A LOT OF STATE MONEY GOES TO COUNTIES. AND THE COUNTIES ACTUALLY OF THE ONES THAT USE THE NON PROFITS AND WRITE THE CONTRACTS AND SO YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME APPROPRIATION FROM THE STATE. HAVE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT OVERHEAD RATES FOR EXAMPLE IF IT CAME THROUGH LA COUNTY EFFORT CAME FROM YOLO COUNTY GOT IT [inaudible] SO ON JANET YOU MENTIONED THAT THE YOU HAVE SEEN IT REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN FUNDING -- ARE THERE STRATEGIES THAT LEGISLATIVE BODY CAN CONSIDER -- TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WELL AS YOU KNOW A LOT OF GOVERNMENT MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED BASED ON POPULATION COUNTS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE KIND OF SURPRISED TO SEE HOW MUCH DISPARITY THERE IS IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND SO I THINK AGAIN RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING. WHAT THAT IS -- WE ARE ABLE ONLY TO TELL GOVERNMENT FUNDING IN TOTAL UP BY REGION WE AREN'T ABLE TO SEPARATE IT OUT RIGHT NOW BY FEDERAL STATE. I'M COUNTY OR CITY SO IT'S HARD TO KNOW RIGHT NOW WITH EXACTLY WHAT WOULD WORK BUT I DO THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO PAY MORE ATTENTION -- TO JUST LIKE YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WERE JOBS MONEY IS GOING PAID ATTENTION TO IS GOING IS IMPORTANT AS WELL. I'M ONE OF THE OTHER PIECES THAT WAS MENTIONED IS THAT -- THERE IS A 10%. CAP. ON INDIRECT COSTS THAT COMES FROM SOME OF THESE GRANTS -- IS THAT IN SOME ACTUALLY HAVE 3% SO HAVE EVERY SO. IS THAT IN STATUE OR IS THAT BASED ON THE AGENCY IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE AGENCY IF THAT FEELS. LIKE. FOR SOME GRANTS IT NEEDS TO CHANGE. IN SOME CASES IT'S WRITTEN INTO THE LEGISLATION FOR EXAMPLE FEDERAL MONEY MAY HAVE CAPS -- RARELY DID THE CAPS OCCUR IN STATE FUNDING -- AND DIFFERENT COUNTIES THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE CAN'T SAME COUNTY WILL HAVE VERY DIFFERENT RULES SO ONE OF THE ISSUES FOR NON PROFITS IS THAT THE SAME NONPROFIT LIKE THE CENTER FUMAN SERVICES IN MODESTO THAT I MENTIONED. THEY MIGHT HAVE FIFTEEN DIFFERENT INDIRECT COSTS RATES BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING WITH DIFFERENT AGENCIES. SO WE'RE DOING THE PILOT PROJECT RIGHT NOW WITH THE AUDITOR CONTROLLER IN LA COUNTY WITH THE HOPES OF TRYING TO FIND A WAY SO THAT WHEN A NON PROFITS CONTRACTING WITH THE COUNTY. IF THE IF THE FUNDING AGENCIES STATE OR FEDERAL HAS NOT SPECIFIED IN INDIRECT COSTS RIGHT TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE ONE IN DIRECT COSTS RATE. SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS PILOT IN LOS ANGELES SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE HAVE MULTIPLE INDIRECT COSTS RATES WHICH IS CRAZY MAKING FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE POINT OF VIEW -- I MEAN THIS MEANS THIS MEANS THINGS LIKE I'VE SEEN ONE FIND ONE MEALS ON WHEELS ORGANIZATION THAT WAS ABLE TO GET FUNDING FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE FOOD BUT NOT FOR THE PEOPLE TO HELP COOK IT OR FOR THE TRAYS TO PUT THE FOOD IN. THIS IS KIND OF THE REEDY CRAZIES BUT LANCE TO WHICH THE INDIRECT COSTS PRO PROBLEM CAN SOMETIMES GO. TO SO WE'RE HOPING THAT IF THE PILOT IN LA GOES WELL THAT WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT DOING IT IN OTHER COUNTIES AT THE STATE MIGHT CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO SOME. ONE AGENCY IN THE IF YOU HAVE ONE CONTRACT BUT SAY WITH HUMAN SERVICES AND YOU HAVE AN INDIRECT COST RATE WITH THEM YOU COULD USE THAT SAME RATE FOR YOUR CONTRACT WITH MEDIC WITH OB FISH AND WILDLIFE WITH DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EXETER ABOUT WOULD BE OUR GOAL. TENSION AND AND TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS PET PROGRAM WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO FIND TO FOR IT TO CONCLUDE IN WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME. FINDINGS OF SORTS RELATED TO THIS SORT OF THE PILOT PROGRAM AN ALLEY -- SO WAIT AT WHERE IS IT IN THE STAGE VERY HARD IT IS IT FINISH I MEAN IS A PILOT PROGRAM GOING TO BE DONE DO WE KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE. IN TERMS OF THE FINDINGS OF THE IT'S KIND OF MOVING IT IS LIKE IT LIKE IT'S MOVING SOME SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE AN AVALANCHE AND MOVES INCREDIBLY FAST AND THEN LIKE. NOTHING HAPPENS FOR LIKE I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW TEN YEARS TIME SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THE THE PILOT WILL ACTUALLY LAUNCH THIS FALL THIS FALL AND THEN WE'LL HAVE RESULTS IN MAYBE SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR. THANK YOU GREAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO ALL THREE OF YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME. TO TO YOU KNOW KEEP US INFORMED A LOOK FORWARD TO STAYING IN TOUCH -- PARTICULARLY WITH THAT JUST THE WEBSITE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A BIG DEAL -- BUT ALSO OF COURSE WITH UNDERSTANDING BETTER AND I THINK THE FOR FOR THIS BODY IT WE DO WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE FIXES COULD BE. IF. IF WE HAVE THE NONPROFIT SERVING AS THE FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE WAYS THAT YOU COULD WORK SMOOTHER I'M ON ALL FRONTS I A THINK IT'S NOT INTENDED. TO NECESSARILY JUST AT TAKE A POSITION OF ONLY HELPING THE NONPROFIT BUT ALSO THE STATE I MEAN WITH THIS MUCH FUNDING GOING TO NON PROFITS ARE THERE ELEMENTS THAT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. CONSIDER THAT WOULD FACILITATE SOME OF THIS I KNOW IN A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD AS WELL [inaudible] AND THE NONPROFIT WORLD AND EVEN PAYMENT SYSTEMS ARE CHANGING RIGHT THERE'S MORE TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED -- AND SO A A THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD BE AN OPEN AS A BODY TO CONSIDER WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. THERE IS NOT A DEDICATED NONPROFIT STANDING POLICY COMMITTEE RIGHT AND SO THIS IS OUR PLACE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE TRANSLATE SOME OF WHAT WERE SEEN IN OUR FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY THAT SERVES MILLIONS. OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ALSO EMPLOYEES MANY CALIFORNIANS HOW WE COULD FACILITATE SOME OF THAT ELEMENT THAT COULD BE HELPFUL TO SEEN NONPROFITS BE MORE HEALTHY BOTH FINANCIALLY AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THEIR GOALS. THANK YOU THANKS TO THE THREE OF YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE WITH US TODAY. NEXT -- TO OUR PANEL IS LOOKING AT WHAT THESE PARTNERSHIPS ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE BETWEEN NONPROFITS AND STATE AND ENTITIES AND WE WILL START. USING -- DISCUSSING MENTAL HEALTH -- WE HAVE KAREN SMITH HERE WITH THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- WE ALSO. I HAVE A SHINE AT USE YOU SOFT C. AND I'M SORRY IF I MISSED -- THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF OUR MUSLIM AMERICAN SOCIETY SOCIAL. SERVICES FOUNDATION -- AND WE HAVE ONE MORE GUEST AND I WILL ALLOW THAT GUESTS -- INTRODUCED THEMSELVES THAT WE WILL GO. GO AHEAD AND START AND THEN I THINK WE'RE MOVING TO VETERANS TO START. SO -- GOOD AFTERNOON I'M A DOCTOR KAREN SMITH I'M THE CALIFORNIA STATE HEALTH OFFICER THE DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROJECTS IN OUR DEPARTMENT -- WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HOW THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY WORKS WITH NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ELEVATE COMMUNITY DEFINED -- PROMISING PRACTICES A LITTLE BACKGROUND FIRST ON THE PROJECT THE NAME OF WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT. SEVEN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY FOUR OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE NOW KNOWN AS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT OR MHSAA. IN MHSAA ADDRESSES AND SUPPORTS A BROAD CONTINUATION OF PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND MENTAL HEALTH -- INNOVATION -- IN -- TO FOR FOR FOLKS ACROSS THE LIFESPAN -- MHSAA ALLOCATES AND EARLY INTERVENTION AS A KEY STRATEGY TO PREVENT MENTAL ILLNESS FROM BECOMING SEVERE AND DISABLING. I'M INTO A PROOF TIMELY ACCESS FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. THE S. P. E. I. PROGRAMS AS THEY'RE CALLED EMPHASIZE STRATEGIES TO REDUCE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES THAT MAY RESULT FROM UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. AND IN RESPONSE TO THE FORMER US SURGEON GENERAL DAVID SATCHER IS CALL FOR NATIONAL ACTION TO REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE FORMER CALIFORNIA'S POINT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH CREATED A STATEWIDE POLICY INITIATIVE TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER. UNSERVED OR INAPPROPRIATELY SERVED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE FORMER DEMON DEPARTMENT MIDDELHOFF LAUNCHED A FIRST THE FIRST PHASE OF THE STATE WIDE PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORT CALLED THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT OR AS I WILL REFER TO IT C. R. D. P. -- THIS FOCUSES ON FIVE PRIORITY POPULATIONS AFRICAN AMERICAN ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER -- A NATIVE AMERICANS AND LESBIAN GAY. BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER QUEER QUESTIONING WHICH I WILL REFER TO AS LGBT Q.. PHASE ONE OF THIS PROJECT INVOLVED MAJOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS TO DEVELOP% FIVE REPORTS ONE FOR EACH SPECIAL POPULATION -- WITH SPECIFIC STREET STRATEGIC PLANNING WORK GROUPS WHO WERE TASKED WITH TELLING THE STORY OF MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES WITHIN THOSE SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. THESE REPORTS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED ALSO IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE PRACTICES THAT ARE SHOWN PROMISE IN ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH -- IN THEIR COMMUNITY A COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE PRACTICE ARE SET TO PRACTICES THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE USED AND DETERMINED BY COMMUNITY CONSENSUS TO YIELD POSITIVE OUTCOMES. AND THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN EMPIRICALLY SHOWN TO DO SO. BUT THEY HAVE REACHED A LEVEL OF ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY -- THAT INSURES THEIR ON GOING NATURE AND THE COMMUNITY BELIEVES IN THE VALUE OF THESE PROGRAMS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF PHASE ONE WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A THIRTY TWO MEMBER CALIFORNIA MHSAA MULTI COAT MULTI CULTURAL COALITION. THE COALITION BOTH SUPPORTED THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE PROJECT OVERALL -- FOR PHASE ONE BUT IT ALSO INCLUDED A FOCUS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OUTSIDE THOSE SPECIAL POPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THE MIDDLE EASTERN COMMUNITIES AT CETERA. THE FINAL COMPONENT OF THAT FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMUNITY AUTHORED C. R. D. P. STRATEGIC PLAN. THE PLANTS THAT THE SIZE THE FIVE POPULATION REPORTS AN OUTLINE GOALS FOCUSED ON CHANGING THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO BETTER SERVE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. C. R. D. P. FACE TWO ADDRESSES SEVERAL OF THE GOALS FROM THE STRATEGIC PLAN AND IS BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- OFFICE OFHEALTH EQUITY -- PHASE TWO WAS LAUNCHED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WILL SUNSET IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THIS SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR INITIATIVE AIMS TO EVALUATE AND SUPPORT CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY RESPONSIVE COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE PRACTICES. IMPLEMENTED BY LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. SEE OUR TO BE AIMS TO BEGIN CREATING A CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF DIVERS AND PARTICULARLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IT IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND INITIATIVE FOCUSING ON REDUCING MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THESE FIVE PRIORITY POPULATIONS. AND IT FOLLOWS GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF DOING BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY BUILDING COMMUNITY CAPACITY FAIRNESS AND CREATING SYSTEM CHANGE. SUSTAINING EFFORTS TO REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES BEYOND THE THE SPAN OF THE CRT P. FACE TO FUNDING REQUIRES THAT WE INVEST IN. CREATING OR INCREASING COMMUNITY CAPACITY AND SOME MORE AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ONE OF THE PRIMARY AIMS OF C. R. D. P. FUNDING IS TO BRIDGE THE GAP. BETWEEN COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE AND THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES -- THAT WE GENERALLY ACCEPT AS THE WAYS TO DO TO DO -- TO PROVIDE SERVICES I'M AND WE'RE DOING THIS THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED PARTS PARTICIPATORY EVALUATION METHODOLOGIES THAT HONOR THE EXPERTISE TO THE COMMUNITY. THIS APPROACH BOTH BILLS COMMUNITY CAPACITY AND ADDS TO THE EVIDENCE BASED FOR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICE. A PROGRAM LIKE C. R. D. P. IS DESIGNED TO DECREASE JUST DISPARITIES. WHICH IS DESIGNED TO BE CHRISTOPHER SIMPLY CAN'T PERPETUATE THOSE THAT'S WHERE THE FAIRNESS AS A AS ONE OF THE MAJOR PRINCIPLES THAT WE OPERATE ENTER COMES INTO. THE C. R. D. P. GRANTS AND CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN AWARDED BASED ON MERIT. AND ONLY AFTER ALL INTERESTED PARTIES HAVE HAD AN IN BIT HAVE BOTH BEEN INVITED TO APPLY AND IF NEEDED. PROVIDED WITH THE TOOLS AND SERVICES TO SUPPORT THEIR APPLICATION. SO THE CRT P. SOLICITATION PROCESS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS PROP THIS PROJECT IS DOING GIVE BUSINESS. ESPECIALLY STATE BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY FOR EVERY SOLICITATION THAT WE RELEASED PRE DRAFT SOLICITATIONS WERE ISSUED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND THOSE COMMENTS WERE THEN INCORPORATED INTO. CONSIDERATIONS AS SOLICITATIONS WERE REVISED TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS AND ABILITIES OF THE APPLICANTS THEMSELVES. THE SOLICITATION SCORING TEAMS WERE COMPRISED OF STATE -- EMPLOYEES FROM ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AND THERE WAS AN APPLICATION PROCESS TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE STORE A SCORING TEAM AND THIS REQUIRED EXTENSIVE PERSONAL STATEMENTS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY THE ACT THAT BOTH EXPRESSED THE APPLICANTS INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING. BUT ALSO DEMONSTRATED THEIR CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE IN MENTAL HEALTH AND IN WORKING WITH MULTI CULTURAL LGBT Q. COMMUNITIES. OF COURSE HERE TO BE DOESN'T EXIST IN A VACUUM -- IF THE EFFORTS TO REDUCE REDUCE DISPARITIES THAT BEGIN WITH C. R. T. P. -- PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO ARE TO BE SUSTAINED BEYOND FUNDING WE NEED TO IMPACT THE LARGER CONTEXT IN WHICH THESE PROJECTS ARE ON GOING. AND WE'RE WORKING -- TO AND TRY TO BUILD A SMOOTHER INTEGRATION OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED CURRENTLY BY FACE TO PROGRAMS INTO THE LARGER MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM AND TO THIS AND WE'RE WORKING TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IN TERMS OF INCREASING ACCESS TO CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERALL IN THE COMMUNITIES. THAT IS HAS BEEN NOTED IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY REVIEW IS BEING A REALLY A DESPERATE NEED. SO WITH THIS YEAR TO PAY THEIR THIRTY FIVE IMPLEMENTATION PILOT PROJECTS -- THERE THE SOUL OF THE THE OF THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT THESE ARE COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BOTH IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING THEIR COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE. THAT PROVIDE CULTURALLY LINGUISTICALLY RESPONSIVE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES TO MEMBERS OF THE FIVE PRIORITY POPULATIONS. FOR MANY OF OUR THIRTY FIVE PILOT PROJECTS THESE ARE THE FIRST CONTACT THEY'VE EVER HAD WITH THE STATE. IN FACT ELEVEN OF THE THIRTY FIVE THE CURRENT GRANTEES WERE IN FACT FIRST GRANTED. PILOT PROJECT TO WORDS THESE WERE CAPACITY BUILDING AWARDS -- MET THESE THESE WERE ALL HAVE THESE WERE ALL VERY SMALL NON PROFITS OPERATE WITH OPERATING BUDGETS UNDER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEY WERE FIRST AWARDED THESE CAPACITY BUILDING -- GRANTS WHICH IT TOO TO RECEIVE WHICH THEY HAD TO RESPOND TO A SOLICITATION THAT WAS DESIGNED TO REMOVE BARRIERS -- WITH SEVERAL MONTHS OF OF FUNDING TO INCREASE THEIR ABILITY -- TO RESPOND TO THE LARGER -- THE THE IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT SOLICITATION SO WE HELP TO THEM -- AT CREATE ACTUALLY THE THINGS THAT THEY NEEDED TO RESPOND TO FOR EXAMPLE. RELATIONS SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS REFINED THEIR DESCRIPTION OF THEIR SPECIFIC EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE -- COMMUNITY EVIDENCE PRACTICE -- DEVELOPED A DETAILED FIVE YEAR WORK PLAN AND BUDGET AT PROPOSED EVALUATION PLAN AND AN ORGANIZATIONAL GROWTH PLAN THESE ARE ALL COMPONENTS OF THE LARGER SOLICITATION. I WILL SAY WE IS MEANS THESE ARE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- CONTRACTORS THAT WE THE STATE CONTRACTED WITH TO PROVIDE THIS OUT SO WE WEREN'T CREATING THE SOLICITATION RESPONSES WE'RE BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THESE VERY SMALL ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY RESPOND. TO BASICALLY ANY KIND OF SOLICITATION FROM THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- FIVE SPECIFIC WE HAVE FIVE POPULATION SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS WHO WORK WITH THE PILOT PROJECTS. AND TO DEVELOP THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL PROGRAMMATIC EVALUATION CAPACITIES THEY ALSO HELP THAT THE PILOT PROJECTS TO IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONS IDENTIFY AND SECURE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND BUILD STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS TO BETTER SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ENSURE THEIR SUSTAINABILITY. WE ALSO HAVE EDUCATION OUT REGION AWARENESS CONSULTANTS TO HELP IMPLEMENT COMPONENTS OF THE THIS YEAR THE P. STRATEGIC PLAN BUT ALSO SUPPORT THE PILOT PROJECTS IN DEMONSTRATING HOW THEIR PROJECTS. ARE DESIGNED TO BETTER ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THESE UNDERSERVED. POPULATIONS THROUGH AND THEIR TRAINING THEM TO USE STORY TELLING MEDIA TRAINING MEDIA CONSULTING SERVICES PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT OUT STRATEGIES FOR THESE NONPROFITS TO ACTUALLY BEGIN TO BUILD FOR THEMSELVES. PARTNERSHIPS I'M IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT MAY HELP THEM BE SUSTAINABLE. AS AN OVERALL PROJECT IN AS A A NOT PREVIOUSLY TESTED METHODOLOGY IS ALSO BEING FULLY EVALUATED THERE IS A STATE WIDE EVALUATOR WHO'S KIND CONDUCTING CROSS SITE EVALUATIONS. THAT INCLUDE STATE ON ALL THE COMPONENTS OF THE THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECTS INCLUDING THE WORK THAT WE ARE THE MEMBERS OF OUR OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY OR DOING. TWO OBJECTIVES FOR THE OVERALL EVALUATION ARE TO EVALUATE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FACE. TO A PHASE TWO AND IDENTIFYING AND STRENGTHENING STRATEGIES THAT CAN REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES WHICH IS THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME. AND THEN THE OTHERS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE PRACTICES IN C. R. D. P. OVERALL THE REASON THIS -- THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IT FOR ME IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THERE IS A A FIXATION AND I I USE THAT WORD. THOUGHTFULLY ON WHAT WE CALL EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. THE CHALLENGE WITH EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES IS THAT THEY TEND TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE SERVE FEW PEOPLE AND REALLY HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED IN ANY BUT CERTAIN KINDS OF CONDITIONS AND DELIVERED BY CERTAIN TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS CAN I ASK YOU JUST A CLARIFYING QUESTION. WHEN YOU SAY THAT THERE'S A FIXATIONON EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES? FROM YOUR LAND IS THAT A FIXATION THAT EASE PROMPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE BY PRACTITIONERS BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- IT'S LARGELY PROMULGATED BY FUNDERS AND RESPONDING TO LEGITIMATE CRITICISM THAT. WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB WE THAT GENERAL COMMUNITY OF THOSE OF US WHO GOT FINDING -- YOU KNOW DAY DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE DO DO -- WHY WE CHOOSE THIS METHODOLOGY VERSUS I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- DIABETES WE DO A LOT OF WORK ON DIABETES THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS THAT PEOPLE APPROACH TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN COMMUNITIES TREATING THEIR DIABETES. THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO THAT HAVE BEEN RIGOROUSLY TESTED -- IT PARTICULARLY THIS IS IT THIS WHOLE IDEA OF EVIDENCE BASEMENTS ACTUAL CANCER MEDICINE WHERE YOU'RE DEALING WITH ONE PERSON ONE DOCTOR AND HOW ABOUT. PERSONS DISEASE SHOULD BE MANAGED -- WITH DIABETES THE ONE THERE ARE TWO PRACTICES THAT ARE CONSIDERED EVIDENCE BASE I EITHER HAVE BEEN STUDIED AND STUDIED AND STUDIED AND THEY SEEM TO WORK. THEY ARE THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WHICH HAS VERY PRETTY AND THEY'RE ALL THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE BECAUSE BY THEIR VERY NATURE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE. AND SO -- IT TELLS THE COMMUNITY WORKER EXACTLY HOW THEY WILL WORK WITH THIS PATIENT WITH DIABETES -- AS REFERRED BY THIS DOCTOR THE CHALLENGE WITH EXPANDING THAT TO COMMUNITIES AND PARTICULARLY TO NON TYPICAL COMMUNITIES. IS THAT YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO ADOPT YOUR SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING SERVICE. TO AND SO WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES IS IT SAYS WE RESPECT THE FACT THAT COMMUNITIES BELIEVE THAT THAT THE PRACTICE THAT'S ONGOING AND WE CHOSE ON GOING PRACTICES THAT THE COMMUNITIES VALUED. HOUSE VALUE IF THE COMMUNITY BELIEVES THAT. THEN WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE THOSE ORGANIZATIONS DEVELOP ENOUGH EVIDENCE BY THE WE WILL USE MORE RIGOROUS METHODOLOGY THAN THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE TO EVALUATE THEIR PRACTICES. TO THAT'S ONE GOAL IS TO SAY WE WANT TO ADD TO THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR MENTAL HEALTH. AND IN PARTICULAR FOR PRACTICE THAT WILL REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES THERE'S NO EVIDENCE BASE FOR THAT AT A POPULATION LEVEL AT ALL SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. TO SAY YOU WILL YOU ONLY USE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES SO WE WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT SCIENCE BY TAKING THESE PRACTICES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN COMMUNITIES. AND RIGOROUSLY EVALUATING THEM AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THE ONLY ONES PROVIDING THESE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE SERVICES. SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS THE WORLD OF FUNDING. THAT LARGELY REQUIRES THAT YOU PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WORKS THERE CAUGHT IN A CATCH. TWENTY TWO THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES BELIEVE THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING WORKS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO EVALUATE IT TO THE LEVEL THAT IS REQUIRED FOR AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE. AND NO WAY TO GET THERE FROM WHERE THEY ARE AND THEY OFTEN DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY EITHER THAT THE ACTUAL TECHNICAL KNOW HOW OF HOW TO DO THAT KIND OF EVALUATION. SO WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH BOTH SUPPORTING THESE PRACTICES BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO REDUCE DISPARITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH. AND FOLKS IT IN COMMUNITIES BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE A WAY TO DO THAT THAT'S WORKING WE WANT TO SUPPORT THAT WE WANT TO BUILD THE EVIDENCE BASE. AND QUITE FRANKLY WE NEED THE NONPROFIT TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN COMMUNITIES AND WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO BE SUSTAINABLE. THIS IS ONE PROJECT THAT VIOLATES ALMOST EVERY RULE OF STATE FUNDING -- IN ORDER TO TRY O DO THOSE THINGS SNIP WITH PERMISSION. THANK YOU ARE THERE AND THEY'RE PREVENTION TO DO THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND NOW THIS AND AND WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A REALLY OUTSTANDING NONPROFIT -- FROM THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT SO HANDED. THANK YOU DOCTOR KAREN -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME OPPORTUNITIES TO TALK ABOUT HOW IS THE NONPROFIT WE'VE BENEFITED WITH WORKING WITH THE STATE -- THE SHAPES ARE TIME -- SO -- MY NAME IS GOES ON USE OF SITE AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE MUSLIM AMERICAN SOCIETY SOCIAL SERVICES FOUNDATION I'M AWFUL. SO IN SHORT I WILL JUST REFER TO US AS MASSIVE STUFF -- SO JUST I'M GONNA GIVE FULLER BUT A BACKGROUND AND THEN HOW WE BENEFITTED AND WHERE WE HAVE COME TO BE AS A RESULT OF BEING FUNDED -- WITH THIS AND WITH THIS -- VERY UNIQUE -- GRANT -- OPPORTUNITY -- SO AGAIN JUST YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME.

STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEM OF CARE FOR CALIFORNIA SERVICE MEMBERS VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR CHECK CALVET REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY AND FOR THIS INVITATION -- HOPE TO IDEA OF A LITTLE QUICK SLIDE SHOW FOR YOU -- TODAY I'LL BE TALKING A BIT ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND FOR KILLED FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES DISCUSS OUR RELATIONSHIPS. WITH STATE LOCAL AGENCIES -- AND PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF CABS AS POLICY PRIORITIES HIGHLIGHTS SEVERAL OF OUR RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND AND OUTLINED SOME OF OUR FUTURE STRATEGIES FOR COORDINATION WITH STATE AGENCIES AND THE LEGISLATURE ON VETERANS RELATED PUBLIC POLICY -- CANCER FORMED A BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IN THIS OF THE SCALE. AND THE DEPTH OF THE CHRONIC PROBLEMS FACING OUR VIETNAM VETERANS -- INCLUDING A LACK OF ACCEPTANCE BACK INTO CIVILIAN LIFE AFTER A WASTED WAR -- AGAIN WE ORGANIZED IN -- NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WE'RE NOW CONSORTIUM OF SEVEN COMMUNITY BASED VETERANS SERVICE. NONPROFIT AGENCIES COVERING CALIFORNIA FROM EUREKA SAN DIEGO -- THESE ARE THE SEVEN AGENCIES VERY QUICKLY -- U. S. THAT'S IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION -- BUT IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE LOCATED IN ORDER LA LEARN ORANGE COUNTY VENTURE AND RIVERSIDE. THE VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS ARE LOCATED MONTEREY NORTH TO EUREKA -- THE VETERANS VILLAGE OF SAN DIEGO IS THE LARGEST -- VETERANS SERVICE PROVIDER IN SAN DIEGO. NEW DIRECTIONS IS IN LOS ANGELES OR JUST IS IN OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE CALIFORNIA VETERANS ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IS IN IN BAKERSFIELD -- AND THE VETERANS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION WORKS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. OUR MISSION STATEMENT -- CABS IS DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT VETERANS OF ALL. ERAS HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING TOOLS AND SUPPORT FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES REVISED FOR SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION BACK HOME. AND WE ADVOCATE FOR REFORM AT THE STATE LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE IMPROVE SERVICES FOR ALL VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. FACTORS AND EVENTS THAT MOTIVATED CABS IS FORMATION INCLUDED INITIALLY A VERY ERRATIC -- WORK FORCE IMPROVEMENT -- PROGRAM THAT WAS FOR STATE FUNDING -- FOR FOR WORK FORCE -- DEVELOPMENT FOR VETERANS -- WE FOUND THE PROGRAM TO THE ERRATIC IN VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND -- PROGRAM FUNDING -- WAS THERE ONE YEAR AND NOT THERE THE NEXT AND IT'S VERY HARD TO KEEP PROGRAMS GOING -- UNDER THAT WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF A CULTURAL COMPETENCE COMPETENCY. IN THE IN IN IN MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING PROVERBIAL PROVIDED AT THAT POINT FOR THE VETERANS -- ALSO. WE SAW GROUP A GROWING NEED TO FILL THE GAP LEFT BY VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS WHO FOCUSED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON BENEFITS AND EMPLOYMENT. BUT NOT ON SUPPORT SERVICES FOR HOMELESS VETERANS -- AND AND VETERAN CENTRIC SUPPORTIVE SERVICES INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND THOSE ISSUES OF ALWAYS BEEN A CORE OF OF THAT OF OF CANCERS -- POLICY PROGRAM -- SO WE SET ASIDE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES SEVEN AGENCIES -- OFTEN COMPETED FOR SOMETIMES FOR FOR GRANTS WE SET THOSE DIFFERENCES ASIDE AND ORGANIZED. IN ORDER TO BECOME A MORE ENGAGED AND MORE ENGAGE IN STATE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS. AND WE FOCUSED ON A COMMON AGENDA OF IMPROVING SERVICES FOR VETERANS IN GENERAL [inaudible] AT TYPICAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WE ARE TYPICAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH BOARD MEMBERS BEING THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE MEMBER AGENCIES ALL. OF MEMBERS OF OF OF THE BOARD OUR VETERANS -- ARE KEY FOCUSES BEEN STATE AND FEDERAL HAVE IT'S ADVOCACY -- OF SINCE THE VAST AMOUNT OF OUR REVENUES ARISE FROM FEDERAL GRANTS INCLUDING -- SUCH GRANTS IS -- THE VETERANS AFFAIRS SUPPORT HOUSING VASH GRANTS FOR HOUSING AND SUPPORTERS SERVICES. GRAND PER DIEM PROGRAM THAT'S FUNDED OUT OF FEDERAL VA. OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH STATE AGENCIES INCLUDES POLICY -- COORDINATION PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT LEGISLATION AND FUNDING -- AND AND AGAIN I THINK ONE OF THE THE KEYS AND ALL DISCUSSES A LITTLE BIT LATER IS THAT WERE SORT OF THE FRONT LINE PRINT SERVICE PROVIDERS VETERANS WE UNDERSTAND DAY TO DAY. THE THE NEEDS IN THE AND THE ISSUES THAT ARE CONFRONTED BY THEM. AND AND I THINK MOST EFFECTIVELY WHEN WE PROVIDE THAT CONDUIT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE BACK TO THE STATE AGENCIES AND WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM. IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER TO TARGET STATE RESOURCES FEDERAL RESOURCES. NONPROFIT RESOURCES ON ON THOSE NEEDS AND ISSUES. THESE ARE POLICY PRODUCE BY A BY ISSUE AREAS SO WE'VE WE'VE COME TO FOCUS ON LARGELY A MENTAL HEALTH AND AND WELLNESS. CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT VETERAN TREATMENT COURTS YOU'LL SEE IS ENGAGED IN THOSE -- IN AND WHAT AND LEGISLATION THOSE AREAS AND WITH THE VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES WORKING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IT JUST PROGRAMS AND FUNDING FOR VETERANS. UNDER HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING -- PROPOSITION FORTY ONE AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER -- CALVET HOME LOANS NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM. DISCRIMINATION IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNDER TRAINING AND EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT -- LACK OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICE DOLLARS. PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION GERBIL A GERBIL ABUSES -- SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUES CERTIFICATION OF VETERANS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND STATE FUNDING AND MEDICARE -- WE'RE TRYING TO BREAK THE CODE AND MEDICARE BECAUSE WE STRUGGLE FINDING SUPPORT SERVICES FUNDING PARTICULARLY WITH CUTS MANY MANY VERY GOOD HOW HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA NOW. BUT WE CAN PUT PEOPLE IN THE HOUSING. BUT WE DON'T HAVE MONEY FOR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IT IS ONLY HALF HALF OF THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED. SOME FOR CRITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS -- LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING THAT THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND TEN STRATEGIC PLAN FOR VETERANS -- WE'VE WE'VE WORKED VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH WITH CALVET AND WITH -- H. CD ON THE VETERANS HOME A HOUSING AND HOMES PREVENTION PROGRAM -- BOND PROGRAM PROPOSITION FORTY ONE WHICH PROVIDED SIX HUNDRED MILLION. FOR CONSTRUCTION AND AND VETERANS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER A GARNER FIFTY SIX MILLION ROUGHLY FIFTY SIX MILLION AND HOUSING LOANS. AND THE INS AND RIGHT NOW THAT PROGRAMS SUPPORTING OVER EIGHT HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS. IT DOESN'T SEEM A LOT WHEN WE SEE THE CURRENT HOUSING. STATISTICS AND AND THE GROWTH THAT WE SEE IN A HOMELESSNESS BUT THIS PROGRAM IS MAKING A DENT FOR VETERANS IN A BIG WAY. AND AND THE AND THE PITCH FOR A SOME LEGISLATION TO HOPEFULLY EXPAND THAT PROGRAM OR CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM I THINK WE'VE USED. ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE OF THOSE DOLLARS. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN REFUND THAT PROGRAM AGAIN BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE -- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE WITH THE MHS ALWAYS SEE -- ON A LOOK AND AND AND AND LOCAL FUNDING -- FOR FOR VETERANS MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS TRYING TO OBTAIN MORE PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE MONEY AT A LOCAL LEVEL FOR VETERANS -- WE SERVED ON THE TO THE THE THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR PROPOSITION ONE AND TWO WHICH AGAIN PROVIDED VICE ONE BILLION DOLLARS -- FOR FOR CALVIN HOME LOAN PROGRAM AND TWO BILLION -- FOR THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM LINKING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH HOUSING. AND THAT WE SPONSOR VARIETY LEGISLATION LAST YEAR A COUPLE OF BILLS -- WE SPONSOR WERE VERY ACTIVE THIS YEAR ON LEGISLATION -- POINT ABOUT WHAT CABS TO GENERATE FOR THE STATE -- WE'VE GOT MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA. A MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND VETERANS ARE SERVED EACH YEAR -- MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS ARE BROUGHT INTO THE STATE THROUGH THE CAVS AGENCIES. AND MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN IS SPENT IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY WAS SPENT IN CALIFORNIA. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT FIFTY FIVE MILLION THAT THE DIFFERENCE THERE IS PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE CAN GENERATE IN -- IN IN IN. IN IN PROVIDING GRANTS AND LOANS FROM -- THE AT THE VARIOUS OTHER NON PROFITS AND CORPORATE FUNDING AND THAT TYPE OF THING -- AND THIS IS IMPACT DATA BY -- BY AGENCIES ALSO I'LL SCAN THROUGH THAT VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE I JUST GAVE YOU THE SUMMARY DATA -- BUT EACH OF THESE AGENCIES -- HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AN EMPLOYMENT BASED ON THEIR VARIOUS AREAS AND PROVIDE AND GENERATE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS -- IT AND BRING IT INTO CALIFORNIA FOR SERVING OUR VETERANS. SO OUR FUTURE STRATEGIES AND INVOLVING NEEDS -- WE'RE LOOKING AT AGAIN THE INVOLVING NEEDS AFFECTED SERVICES WE WERE STARTED AS A AS AN ORGANIZATION SERVING VIETNAM VETERANS COMING HOME FROM THE VERY UNPOPULAR WAR -- BUT WE'RE NOW SERVING POST NINE ELEVEN VETERANS -- UNFORTUNATELY -- ENCOUNTERING SIGNIFICANT% SIGNIFICANT ISSUES MANY COMING BACK FROM EXTENDED TOURS OF DUTY IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND OTHER. OTHER COUNTRIES SOME WERE ISSUES THAT WERE ALSO FOLK NOT FOCUSING ON BACK TO THE VIETNAM VETERANS ISSUE ARE VIRGINS POPULATION IS AGING. AND WITH THOSE AGING VETERANS BECOME COME THE TYPICAL PROBLEMS THAT YOU SEE FROM PHYSICAL AND AND AND MEDICAL CARE ISSUES AT THAT OCCUR WITH AGING -- WE FOCUS ON THAT -- WOMEN'S VETERANS ISSUES A POST NINE ELEVEN VETERANS ISSUES THAT WE TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH -- SERVICES AND FUNDING IS STILL AND CONTINUES TO BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR US VETERANS HOUSING AND RE AUTHORIZATION PROP. FORTY ONE AFTER CARE CASE MANAGEMENT FOR VETERANS AND PERMANENT HOUSING MEDICAL BILLING AND CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AND EMPLOYMENT FUNDING. I THINK THE ONE THOUGHT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE -- WITH WITH THE COMMITTEE IS THAT ARE ENGAGING WITH STATE AGENCIES AND NON PROFITS CAN BE I THINK AN INVALUABLE ASSET FOR STATE AGENCIES -- AND FOR NON PROFITS AS WELL BECAUSE WE WE DIRECTLY SERVE AFTER IS IN NEED AND WE CAN PROVIDE A DIRECT VOICE -- TO THOSE AGENCIES AND FOR THOSE AGENCIES TO THE VETERANS FOR INTO VETERANS. WE CAN SERVICE A REAL TIME VOICE FOR DEVELOPING PROGRAMS AND ALLOCATING RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY. AND WHILE THE AGENCIES CAN PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED EXPERTISE AND IDENTIFYING RESOURCE AND PROGRAMS THAT CAN HELP VETERANS IN NEED -- IN NEED OF SUPPORT. WE'VE DONE I THINK A GOOD JOB OVER THE YEARS OF WORKING WITH CAL THAT. AND THE IMAGE AS ALWAYS SHE HAD WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THESE IN VARIOUS ISSUES -- AGAIN NONPROFITS CAN PROVIDE A DIRECT LINK TO VETERANS IN NEED AND WE DEPEND ON THESE THAT ARE AGENCIES IN MANY CASES FOR PROGRAMS SUPPORT AND FUNDING. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ONE GENERAL QUESTION FOR EACH OF YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS IN YOUR PRESENTATION. YOU ALL DESCRIBED -- ELEMENTS THAT WORKED ON BETWEEN THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE FUNDING IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S MOSTLY GOVERNMENT IS THE FUNDING -- FROM THE FUNDING THE NON PROFITS AND THE SERVICE PROVIDERS BUT YOU ALL ALLUDED. TO ADD MORE COULD BE DONE OR YOU'VE SAID THIS IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE -- WHAT MORE COULD BE DONE BY GOVERNMENT BESIDES INCREASE FUNDING BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THAT? A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE BUT EIGHT IN TERMS OF MAKING THESE PARTNERSHIPS WORK SMOOTHER WHAT ELSE CAN GOVERNMENT DO. AND I IN SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA DO TO MAKE THIS. DIFFERENT I MEAN IN IN IN IN YOURCASE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IS IT REDEFINING THING IS IT RECONSIDERING THINGS. I THINK NOT JUST FOR MENTAL HEALTH BUT ACROSS THE BOARD -- TO I'LL STICK WITH THE TOPIC EVERITT WHICH IS. OUR FUNDING -- DISCOVERED APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING OVER 80% OF THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE THAT TOO EFFECT PROGRAMS IS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT COMES WITH INCREDIBLY. STRICT TIME LIMITS EVERYTHING'S IN SILOS. AND PEOPLE AND THE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED ARE NOT SILENCE. AND SAID THERE'S A THERE'S A REAL TENSION THERE AND THAT IS ESPECIALLY AN ISSUE WHEN YOU'RE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ESPECIALLY SMALL NONPROFIT I WAS BEEN ON SEVERAL BOARDS. I USED TO BE I WORKED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR TEN YEARS WELL EIGHTEEN YEARS -- THEY THEIR SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE THE HUMANS NOT A PARTICULAR DISEASE PROCESS OR WHETHER IT'S MENTAL HEALTH OR WHATEVER AND SO THEY HAVE GREATER FLEXIBILITY. THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT BECAUSE MOST OF THE MONEY THAT WE SEND DOWN IS FEDERAL WE'RE LIMITED TO WHAT CONGRESS HAS SAID THIS PARTICULAR FUNDING STREAM CAN BE USED -- FOR WITH STATE MONEY THE ABILITY -- TO TO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE NOT IT'S NOT THROUGH THE DOORS OPEN INTO WITH THIS MANY ANYTHING YOU WANT BUT TO ALLOW FOR FLOOD A LITTLE FLEXIBILITY IN THE ABSOLUTE EITHER THE TARGET POPULATION OR THE ACTIVITIES -- TO ALLOW FOR DISCRETION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE EACH COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT EACH OF THE POPULATIONS WE SERVE ARE DIFFERENT. AND SO AND ALSO IF YOU IF YOU ONLY EVER DO THE SAME THING YOU WILL NEVER INNOVATE ANYTHING AND SO THERE'S NOT. I THINK THE OTHER THING IS -- THERE ARE AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE EARLIER PANEL THE RESTRICTION ON OVERHEAD. CAN BE REALLY PROBLEMATIC WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM BOTH WITH THE MONEY THAT COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO FROM SOME OF THE STATE MANY FOR US TO AFFECT PROGRAMS WE KNOW JUST HOW HARD IT IS TO DO WHEN WE GET. ABOUT HALF OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS. IT'S THAT MUCH MORE DAMAGING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT THE ABILITY TO ALLOW US TO SET REALISTIC IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MONEY GOES OUT TO LOCALS AND FOR EACH COUNTY -- WE HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS RETURN TWENTY ONE PROGRAM SO THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE CONTRACTS WITH EVERY COUNTY. WE CAME UP WITH THE PROCESS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO TO SET A STANDARD -- OVERHEAD RATE FOR EACH COUNTY THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME BECAUSE EACH COUNTIES DIFFERENT. BUT THAT WAY ALL OF OUR GRANTS THEY KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH OVERHEAD THEY'LL GET AND IT'S DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MEET THEIR NEEDS SOME KIND OF SIMILAR PROCESS FOR AGENCIES. CAN HELP IT. NOT FOR EVERY AGENCY BECAUSE SOME OF THE AGAIN SOME OF THE FINDINGS RESTRICTED BY THE FEDS BUT TO WHEN WE CAN WITH STATE MONEY TO ALLOW US TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE FLEXIBILITY. THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL NONPROFITS NEED TO ACTUALLY BE SUCCESSFUL I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE ONE THING THAT COULD REALLY HELP THANK YOU. AT THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK IS AN I. I'LL SPEAK -- NOW I'M NOT NECESSARILY FROM -- A CANCER PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM A GENERAL NONPROFIT PERSPECTIVE WHAT I'VE SEEN IN WORKING WITH OTHER NON PROFITS PARTICULAR IN THE MENTAL HEALTH GRANT SIDE. AND THAT IS SAID -- NONPROFITS TEND NOT TO BE ALL THAT SOPHISTICATED I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE RECOGNIZE FAIRLY EARLY ON AND I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING CAPS AS AS DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE -- Và SOPHISTICATED APPROACH TO PUBLIC POLICY IN A AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO -- TO OBTAIN GRANT MONEY MOST NONPROFITS. ARE THAT SOPHISTICATED AND AND THE GRANT PROCESS OFTEN TIMES THAT WE'VE SEEN CAN BE EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED AN EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE TO GET ENGAGED IN -- AUNTS AND SO YOU HAD TO TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE APPLYING FOR GRAD SOME PLACE -- IF YOU FOR NONPROFITS WRITING THAT GRANT THEMSELVES IT'S PROBABLY COULD BE WRITTEN VERY WELL -- SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIGHER GRANT WRITERS SO THE RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPAND ACCESS THAT MONEY. CAN BE CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT AT TIMES -- FROM A STRICTLY FROM A CABS A PERSPECTIVE -- ALL AND AND AND AND THIS IS MORE FROM PUBLIC POLICY ILL MOST OF OUR MONEY COMES FROM FEDERAL GRANTS I MENTIONED EARLIER. AND IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE. TO TO COORDINATE -- EIGHTY COHESIVE AND CONCISE MESSAGE BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON ON FUNDING ISSUES AND I KNOW OUR OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST -- OFTENTIMES A VECTOR TO VETERANS ISSUES WERE FORTUNATE AND IN THE MESSAGES CAN BE. DELIVERED PRETTY EFFECTIVELY BUT WORKING WITH THE THE NONPROFIT SAID THAT ACTUALLY ARE ACTIVE BACK IN IN DC AND AND WE WORK OF THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE WITH -- FREQUENTLY -- IN FACT GEORGE WHILE HE IS A GREAT RESOURCE FOR US -- TO TO TO HELP FILTERS POLICIES SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO DC WE EXCHANGE MESSAGES ON ON ON WHAT WHAT'S A PRIORITY -- BUT I THINK WE COULD DO A MUCH MUCH BETTER JOB OF THAT AS WELL -- IN IN JUST COORDINATING OUR OUR MESSAGES BACK TO DC [inaudible] THANK YOU -- CAN YOU RESTATE ACOSTA JUST QUICKLY SO JUST FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT CAN GOVERNMENT DO TO FACILITATE. THE WORK THAT YOU DO BESIDES INCREASE SPENDING SURE. OKAY SO I HAVE TWO THINGS THAT I THINK OF SPEAKING ON FROM -- NONPROFIT THAT -- PROVIDE SERVICES TO AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES -- I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT COULD COULD HELP -- ONE IS JUST AND HAD A REAL -- NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO BE ABLE TO ASK THE COMMUNITY WHAT ARE YOU NEEDS WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WHEN THEY COME TO REFUGEES ARE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES -- BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S OTHER NEEDS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE WELLNESS OVERALL. FOR A PARTICULAR UNDERSERVED COMMUNICATING DOING AN EXTENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT -- FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD WOULD BE ONE I THINK THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL -- ANOTHER THING IS ADVOCACY ENABLING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT IS ADVOCACY AND WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS MANY -- COMMUNITIES -- OR EVEN NON PROFITS -- ARE NOT OUR SMALL NONPROFIT SPECIALLY -- ARE NOT TRAINED OR DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE AND ADVOCACY AND I THINK THAT'S A HUGE PART OF MAKING A GUY YOU KNOW. HELPING THE COMMUNITY OVERALL. AND I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT BECAUSE IT ECHOES I THINK WHAT THE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN THIS. THE SELECT COMMITTEE HAS TOUCHED ON THE FACT THAT [inaudible] MOST -- NON PROFITS AREN'T COMFORTABLE OR CLEAR WHERE ADVOCACY IS ALLOWED IN IS NOT ALLOWED AND SO -- GREATER AWARENESS CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE FOR THE TWO YEARS I KNOW WE'VE TRIED TO TACKLE THAT SO I APPRECIATE. HEARING THAT FROM YOU. SO THE THE CALIFORNIA TERMS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS STILL THEM IN ITS INFANT STAGES WERE ABOUT TWO YEARS SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING -- AND I THINK -- ARE THE MAIN KEY FOR US IS TO TO BE ABLE TO SAYS VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES SERVICE MEMBERS THROUGH THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SO THEIR THEIR NEEDS ARE GOING TO CHANGE I THINK WITH COLLABORATION WITH QUALITY NON PROFITS THAT WERE. WERE WERE CUT WERE INVOLVED WITH NOW -- WERE ABLE TO MISTER HOGAN MENTION A LOT OF A LOT OF STUFF IS. SOLELY BAKER BASED ON EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION BUT TO ADD SOME SUPPORT SERVICES IS WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW -- WITH US BETS TOWARD THE PLOW SHARES WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND INVOLVED WE HAVE. AS I MENTIONED THE NINETEEN CAMPUSES IN LOS ANGELES THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SUPPORT SERVICES THERE HOPEFULLY THAT'S ABLE TO EXPAND OVER THE THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WOULD BE IDEAL TO HAVE SOME. SOMEONE ON SOME CAMPUS WHERE VETERANS SERVICE MEMBER THEIR FAMILY CAN SPEAK TO ABOUT ANY ANY ISSUES THAT. MAYBE THE SCHOOL DOESN'T HAVE SO WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- BASICALLY ANYWHERE WHERE THERE'S A A LARGE GROUP OF VETERANS THAT NEED ASSISTANCE IN THAT. AS YOU ALL THINK ABOUT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND THE PARTNERSHIPS YOU HAVE WITH OTHER NON PROFITS OTHER COMMUNITY AGENCIES WITH SCHOOL SITES WITH COMMUNITIES -- ALTOGETHER. ARE THERE ELEMENTS THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT COULD BE HELPFUL PARTICULARLY FOR SMALLER NONPROFITS THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU'RE LARGER NONPROFIT YOU MIGHT BE MORE SOPHISTICATED YOU HAVE GREATER CAPACITY -- BUT IN CALIFORNIA SO MANY OF THE NONPROFIT SAD THAT MAKE UP THIS FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY ARE STILL CONSIDERED YOU KNOW SMALLER MEDIUM SIZE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE ARE THERE ELEMENTS THAT. CAN ENHANCE A SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP -- IS IT ADVANCE PAYMENTS IT SOUNDS LIKE FLEXIBILITY FEEL LIKE THIS IS A THEME THAT I'M HEARING -- FLEXIBILITY IT IS PART OF IT BUT IS IT MULTI YEAR FUNDING VERSUS SINGLE YOUR FUNDING -- PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHAT WHAT KINDS OF THINGS DO YOU THINK CAN HELP -- SO SMALLER NONPROFITS GET TO THIS. LEVEL THAT'S ONE OF THE PIECES OF THE THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT THAT WE ARE MOST PROUD OF IS THAT WE HAD THESE CAPACITY BUILDING GRANTS AND THEY WERE SPECIFIC THEY WEREN'T AROUND BUILDING YOUR MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY. THERE ARE AROUND HOW DO YOU APPLY FOR A GRANT WHAT DOES YOUR ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE NEED TO LOOK LIKE SO THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO INVOICE THAT SO THAT YOU KNOW HOW. TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE MONEY BUT THEN THE OTHER PIECE AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR SMALL NONPROFITS WHO ARE SORT OF MISSION FOCUSED IS. HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR STORY? AND HOW DO YOU SEE HOW DO YOU LOOK AT YOUR COMMUNITY AND FIGURE OUT WHO ARE THE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AND THEN HOW DO YOU APPROACH THOSE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO BUILD. PARTNERSHIPS FOR YOUR NOT MOST NONPROFITS DO WELL WHEN THEY'RE LINKED IN WITH OTHER NON PROFITS AS YOU ARE MAKING REALLY AN ELEGANT CASE -- FOR AND IT HELPS IF THEY'RE THAT THAT HELPS THEM IN ADVOCACY AS WELL AND SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S A PACKAGE OF THINGS THAT. HELP YOU BOTH. ADMINISTRATIVELY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WE WE'RE AS YOU HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS -- WE HAVE CHALLENGES IN BEING. TIMELY WITH PAYMENTS BUT NONPROFITS OFTEN HAVE CHALLENGES EVEN KNOWING HOW TO INVOICE FOR MONEY AND SO THAT MONEY GETS LEFT ON THE TABLE AND IT'S REALLY THAT'S AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION SO SUMMIT IS VERY CONCRETE SOME OF IT IS MORE. HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR STORY HOW DO YOU -- WHO DO YOU ADVOCATE WITH HOW DO YOU BUILD STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS -- I AGAIN CHECK HELD AT AT AT THE THINK THE POINTED THAT. YOU MADE MADAM CHAIR ABOUT MULTI YEAR FUNDING IS THIS WAS IS REALLY IS A CRITICAL POINT -- AGAIN GOING BACK TO MY MY EARLIER PITCH ABOUT A PARTICULAR SMALLER NONPROFITS PLAN FOR GRANT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT EVERY YEAR AT THAT. GETS TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE BUT IF YOU CAN PUT A GRANT TOGETHER OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD -- IT IT'S IT'S SPREAD SPREADS THE THE PAIN OF A BIT MORE SO I THINK THAT. IS CRITICAL PLUS IT ALLOWS -- THESE NONPROFITS TO MAINTAIN OF AN APPOINTMENT BASIS AND AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES WITH SOME CONSISTENCY -- I THINK THE OTHER OTHER POINT IS IS COLLABORATION -- THE MHS ALWAYS CS MENTAL HEALTH'S OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION IS A LONG AFTERNOON -- WITH THAT MENTAL HEALTH GRANT PROGRAM FUN ADVOCACY -- REGIONAL DUCATION SEVEN OR EIGHT STAKEHOLDER THAT RECEIVE GRANTS AND QUARTERLY WE MADE -- AS A GROUP AND AND AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THE GRANT AND THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IT BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE. AND IT IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MENTAL SERVICES LGBTQ COMMUNITY PERRANCE VETERANS -- AND ENSURING THAT INFORMATION I THINK HELPS -- ALL OF THE NONPROFITS IMPLEMENT THOSE GRANTS MORE EFFECTIVELY BUT ALSO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU. SO I THINK WITH THE WHAT OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY HAS DONE IS IT'S BEEN SO DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW INITIALLY PROVIDING. LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY -- ON WHAT THEY NEED -- WHETHER IT'S FOR SERVICE SOARED AS A NON PROFIT HOW CAN THEY DELIVER THAT SERVICE I THINK -- THAT'S BEEN WONDERFUL THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS BEEN EXCELLENT AND THEN FLEXIBILITY AND ALSO LISTENING TO EACH PARTICULAR NONPROFIT AS TO WHAT THEY NEED. IN TERMS OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE OR OR OR IN TERMS OF THEIR NEEDS AS A COMMUNITY I THINK ALL OF THAT OFFICE ABOUT HOW HEALTHEQUITY HAS BEEN DOING AND IT'S BEEN -- JUST VERY BEAUTIFUL I THINK -- BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT. I I THINK AS A SMALL NONPROFIT WHEN YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED FUNDING BEFORE AND THEN YOU RECEIVE. ONE OF HAVING. OF HAVING THE THE THE CASH FLOW TO BE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S MORE REIMBURSABLE INVOICING. THAT PART IS IS DIFFICULT -- AND SO -- LEARNING HOW TO MANAGE THAT AND MATCHING IT AND SO FORTH I THINK THAT'S ONE CHALLENGE FOR NONPROFITS WHO'D NEVER HAD FUNDING -- I HOPE I'M CLEAR IN WHAT I'M TRYING TO COMMUNICATE HERE BUT I THINK THAT'S A ONE MAJOR -- THING THAT I THINK WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL IF IF THERE'S A WAY TO ALLEVIATE THAT FOR FIRST SMALL NON PROFITS -- BUT OF THIS KIND OF PIGGY BACK OF WHAT I THINK EVERYONE'S PRETTY MUCH SAID THINK MULTI YEAR GRANTS ARE ARE ARE HUGE IT REDUCES THE THE TURNOVER AND IT ALLOWS FOR SOME INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE IN THE IN THE NONPROFIT SAN IN ANYWHERE -- I THINK FOR IN THE VETERAN COMMUNITY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. FOR THE SERVICE ADVISORS TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE VETERANS AND I THINK IF THERE'S A LARGE TURNOVER THAT YOU'RE GONNA KINDA LOSE THAT INTEREST INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S CHANGING DAY TODAY I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE PROBABLY MINUSES ROOM. THINK THE VETERAN COMMUNITY IS IS GET GROWING IT'S GOING HIGHER OR LARGER THE CHECK TO GETTING SMALLER -- BECAUSE THE VIETNAM ERA WORLD WAR -- TWO THERE ANOTHER PASSING AWAY SO THE NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT IT'S AGING KIND OF RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S ALSO MENTAL HEALTH AT THE SAME TIME I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AT THE NONPROFIT CAN UNDERSTAND. THE NEEDS OF THE VETERANS. RIGHT AND FINALLY MY LAST QUESTION IS -- BUT YEAH IT'S A LONG LINES I THINK OF OF WHAT I'VE BEEN. ED JUST IT KIND OF MENTIONING OF YOU'VE GIVEN US IDEAS OF THINGS THAT COULD BE CHANGED ARE THERE ANY -- KIND OF LAST THOUGHT THAT YOU WANT TO LEAVE WITH A LEGISLATIVE BODY IN TERMS OF THE WORK YOU DO AND AND ELEMENTS THAT WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND NOT JUST AS YOU KNOW WE'RE MOVING LEGISLATION FORWARD BUT AS FOR CRAFTING LEGISLATION AS WELL. AND USE SHARED DEFINITELY VERY PRACTICAL THINGS THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE FOR MORE OF A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. AND NOW WHEN I GUESS IN MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL GIVEN WATER THE WORD SERVICE DELIVERY SMALL NON PROFITS I AM THANK YOU ALSO FOR BRINGING UP THE POINT ABOUT THEIR INABILITY. WE CAN'T GIVE MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT HASN'T ALREADY HAPPENED. THE STATE CANNOT GRANT ST MONEY FOR SOMETHING HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. THAT IS A HUGE BARRIER TO GETTING SMALL NONPROFITS EITHER EXPANDING OR DOING SOMETHING NEW BECAUSE THEY'RE RUNNING RIGHT CLOSE TO THEIR BASE LINE IF WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE. MONEY TO GET THEM TO START UP FUNDING AND ACTUALLY START FOR RECEIVING SERVICES. WHICH EITHER COULD BE PAY BACK OR YOU KNOW SO IN OTHER WORDS IT DON'T IT AS IT ABOUT POSTS ARE SAYING. OKAY GO AHEAD. EXPAND YOUR SERVICES WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU ANY MONEY UNTIL YOU BILL US FOR THOSE SERVICES YOU CAN'T HIRE PEOPLE ON A PROMISE THAT YOU'LL PAY THEM LATER -- AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING NON PROFITS TO DO AND I THINK FOR SMALL ORGANIZATIONS IN PARTICULAR THAT DON'T CARRY A LARGE AMOUNT OF OF MONEY IN THE BANK. IT'S IT ACTUALLY CAN BE A GAME AND I WAS -- TAKEN BY ONE OF THE EARLIER --COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE IN THE IN THE FIRST PANEL ABOUT HOW LARGE THE NONPROFIT -- COMMUNITY IS AND IN CALIFORNIA IT SURPRISED ME I HAD NO IDEA WHAT ONE IN -- SEVEN AND AND I THINK THAT. IT JUST IT JUST BRINGS TO MIND THE IMPORTS OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND AND THE WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEE DOES BECAUSE OF ITS THAT LARGE A SEGMENT OF OUR OUR ECONOMY OF OUR OUR BY OUR WORK FORCE -- WE CERTAINLY ARE PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO IT. ANNA AND I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE HEARING HIGHLIGHTING THAT IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK JUST IT NEEDS WE NEED MORE OF THAT WE NEED. MORE OF AN UP THE NONPROFIT OR THE MONEY TO RUN AROUND TELL EVERYBODY WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB -- AND SO. THIS IS FREE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THAT WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. SO -- I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH WITH. A PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN MY PREVIOUS POSITIONS AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN -- OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY WAS STARTING THE PHASE ONE AND PHASE TO PHASE ONE AND AND ALSO ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I AM I AM FROM AFGHANISTAN AND I'VE GONE TO THE WHOLE REFUGEE PROCESS WHEN I WAS A CHILD. AND SO -- I THINK WITH THAT SAID -- WE NEED TO JUST FOCUS MORE ON LISTENING. TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN NEED IN WITHIN THESE NONPROFITS IN TERMS OF WHAT WORKS FOR THEM TO HELP THEM HEAL AND TO LIVE A LIFE OF WILDNESS. AND I THINK -- OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW THAT PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE WHO'S BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT -- BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT AND THEIR NAMING TO COMMUTE TO FIND PRACTICE -- BUT IT IS IT'S SO CRITICAL TO TO TO TO CURE A COMMUNITY YOU NEED. TO ASK THEM WHAT IS IT THAT WORKS FOR YOU AND MANY TIMES IT IS NOT ONLY THE SERVICE -- BUT ALSO THE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC MEANS -- THAT MANY TIMES ARE JUST OVERLOOKED -- AND AND THE TRUST AND SO I THINK -- I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO THINK ABOUT -- AND IN TERMS OF GETTING NOT ONLY THESE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BUT NON PROFITS THAT SERVE THESE COMMUNITIES -- TO TO SUPPORT THE MORE ENABLE THEM IN THESE AREAS THANK YOU. AND ON THE STATE GOVERNMENT SIDE -- THAT CALVET CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A NON PROFITS BECAUSE OF AMEND THIS WERE DEFERRED MANY TIMES TODAY FLEXIBILITY THEY'RE ABLE TO WORK THE ELIGIBILITY OF THE PROGRAM'S IS -- A LOT DIFFERENT THAN THE STATE GOVERNMENT THEY'RE THEY'RE ABLE TO WORK FASTER AT CERTAIN TIMES -- AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAL BUT WE CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME SO WE KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO BE BUT WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH NON PROFITS IS. IS -- FORCE MULTIPLIER FOR US AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. THANK YOU AND I QUE DESCRIBED AS FORCE MULTIPLIER. THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE WITH -- US -- TODAY WE VERY MUCH VALUE -- THE FEEDBACK AND THE THOUGHT THAT YOU'VE SHARED WITH US THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT TO AND THIS WOULD BE THE TIME WHERE WE WELCOME YOU. AND TO THE MICROPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CALLING THIS I'M JENNIFER FEARING THE SACRAMENTO ADVOCATE FOR COUNT ON PROFITS AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL TO YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS COMMITTEE -- AND FRANKLY THROUGH THE WHOLE HOST OF LEGISLATION THAT YOU KERRY THAT SPEAKS TO THAT NEEDS OF OF VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AND I THINK WE HEARD A LOT OF REALLY GREAT IDEAS TODAY AND I CLEARLY HEARD YOUR CALL TO ACTION FOR DEVELOPMENT OF KIND OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL TAKE THAT BACK AND CONSULT WITH OUR TEN THOUSAND MEMBERS -- ORGANIZATIONS ON THAT POINT I DID WANT TO JUST POP UP TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE ADVOCACY TRAININGS AND JUST TO MAKE SURE SPACE REASON SOME PEOPLE ARE ARE STREAMING IN WATCHING THIS ONLINE. TO BE AWARE THAT THIS HAS COME UP TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT COUNT ON PROFITS HAS BEEN PLEASED TO BE PARTNERING ALREADY THIS YEAR WITH NEXT GEN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE PUT ON TO VERY WELL ATTENDED. NONPROFIT ADVOCACY TRAININGS WE HAD OUR FIRST IN LOS ANGELES THAT SEND SENATOR MITCHELL JOIN US FOR THE OTHER OR CLOSE TO A HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS THERE AND THEN JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE WERE IN STOCKTON WITH MAYOR TUBS. AND SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY SUPERVISOR MILLER ANOTHER DIVERSE ARRAY OF NONPROFIT LEADERS IN THAT COMMUNITY TO REALLY BREAK DOWN THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF OF WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO WITH IT BUT THE VALUE OF ENGAGING IN ADVOCACY AND HEARING FROM ELECTED LEADERS IN THAT SPACE ABOUT. HOW MUCH THEY WANTED TO HEAR FROM? THAT FROM THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY ABOUT THEIR NEEDS AND ABOUT THEIR POLICY IDEAS IT WAS DEVON REALLY TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES WE HAVE. TWO MORE PLANNED IN TWENTY NINETEEN ONE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND THEN ONE ON THE NORTH COAST AND WE ARE HEARING OF A STRONG CALL 424- HOLDING MORE OF THOSE NO WE HAD ONE AND THAT WAS HOSTED IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND SANTA BARBARA LAST YEAR IN THERE. IT SEEMS TO BE A STRONG THIRST WITHIN THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THIS MORE SO WE WANT TO TRY TO MEET THAT. AND I GUESS I'LL JUST QUOTE WANTED TO CLOSE BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE ENTHUSIASM WE HAVE THAT OUR GOVERNOR HAS RECENTLY APPOINTED -- A NEW SENIOR ADVISER ON TO SERVICE SORT OF A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE PHILANTHROPIC AND NONPROFIT COMMUNITY AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT SIGNAL SORT OF SIMILAR TO THE CREATION OF THIS COMMITTEE. IT SHOWS A REALLY A SIGIFICANT GROWTH AT THE STATE LEVEL OF ENGAGING THIS SIGNIFICANT SECTOR THAT REALLY WE REALLY HAVE HAD A HARD TIME PREVIOUSLY FIGURING% OUT HOW TO ACCESS -- THAT POLICY ARENA SO GRATEFUL TO BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND I HOPE YOU'LL YOU'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IT CONNECT -- WITH -- KATHLEEN. HAS TAKEN ON THAT ROLE AND SEE WHAT WE CAN WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT THAT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO TRY. TO CONNECT AND KIND OF EXPAND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE DO AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT WITH THAT CAL NONPROFITS HAS NOW -- A SCHEDULE OF I'M OF THESE TRAINING AND WORKSHOPS I WOULD LOVE TO ASK FOR AT LEAST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TO BE SHARED ONE WITH MYSELF BUT ALSO WITH THE MEMBERS WHO REPRESENT THE GENERAL AREA I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A GREAT THING. THAT PERHAPS -- THEY CAN SHARE WITH THEIR NON PROFITS AS WELL I'M JUST KNOWING THAT THESE ARE HAPPENING IN GETTING THE WORD OUT BECAUSE WE DO AS ELECTED OFFICIALS GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM NON PROFITS RELATED. TO ADVOCACY AND FUNDING AND SO I THINK WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THE THE LEADERS HAVE A WAY TO SAY LOOK THERE HERE'S A RESOURCE FOR YOU -- WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT SO THANK YOU. I HEARING NO ADDITIONAL NANA AND ISSUE DON'T KNOW ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE AGAIN FOR PARTICIPATING FOR TAKING THE TIME I KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY BUSY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE'S MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO. WANTED TO BE HERE BUT WHAT. COULD NOT EVEN PHYSICALLY ATTEND BECAUSE OF THE DEMANDS ON THEIR TIME AT THE MOMENT SO -- IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE CAN WE CONSIDER VERY IMPORTANT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS. SOME OF MY TAKE AWAYS -- ARE CERTAINLY RELATED TO WHAT THE STATE CAN -- PERHAPS DUE TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY TO ALSO FOCUS ON THE SMALLER NONPROFIT TO HAVE A DIFFERENT TOUCH ON A A YOU KNOW WITHIN THEIR THEIR COMMUNITY -- AT AS WELL AS REALLY FOCUSING ON SOME OF THE GREATER ISSUES THAT CANNOT BE SOLVED A THING TODAY -- BY THE STATE ALONE -- MENTAL HEALTH IS ONE OF THE THE THE ISSUES THAT DESPITE. SO MANY MEMBERS KNOWING HOW BIG OF A CONCERN IT IS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE WE STILL FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH -- AS A STATE AND A THINK THAT WE WE HEAR OF OF SOME OF SOME OF THESE AREAS WHERE THE FUNDING IS GOING THAT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO HEAR -- BUT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO PARTNER WITH OTHER ENTITIES WITH OTHER OTHER. YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT ENTITIES OR NON PROFITS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE NONPROFITS REALLY HAVE PICKED UP SOME OF THE PIECES WHERE THE STATE IS NOT ABLE TO PICK UP SO. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR PARTICIPATING AND FOR ENGAGING IN THIS DISCUSSION I HOPE THAT THOSE OF YOU WATCHING ONLINE -- ALSO ENJOYED THE DISCUSSION AS MUCH AS WE DID AND I DO HOPE THAT THOSE WATCHING ONLINE OR THOSE AT THAT PARTICIPATING ANY OTHER WAY THAT STILL HAVE COMMENTS WILL REACH OUT TO US EVEN AS COMMITTEE CHAIR WE WANT TO KEEP HEARING FROM FOLKS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT. WE CAN DO -- IT TO HELP NONPROFITS BAD BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITY AND TO HELP THE FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY IN OUR STATE. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU AGAIN
