THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY FIRST TO PRESENT SB FIVE FIVE SIX ON BEHALF OF SENATOR DODD. SB FIVE FIVE SIX WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA INTO CONFORMANCE WITH EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SEEKING TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC THAT'S CLEARLY ELEVATED OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT BROADBAND ACCESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR PARTICIPATING IN EVERY ASPECT OF MODERN SOCIETY. SB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BUT CONFORMING CALIFORNIA LAW WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FCC FEDERAL REGULATION IN ORDER TO EXPAND FIVE G. DEVELOP DEPLOYMENT. AND CONTRIBUTE TO COME CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE BILL REQUIRES LOCALITIES TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THEIR STREET LIGHT AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES IN ORDER TO PURTELL COMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO ATTACH THEIR WIRELESS FACILITIES. THE BILL ALSO FOCUSES ON ENSURING THAT ACCESS TO THOSE POLLS ARE PROVIDED A NON DISCRIMINATORY DISCRIMINATORY COST BASE RATE SENATOR DODD HAS ADDED AUTHORED AMENDMENTS TO PRESERVE. EXISTING AGREEMENTS AND PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS SPECIFIC TO LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS. SENATOR DODD HAS ALSO ADDED LANGUAGE TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS REQUIRING SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MONITOR THEIR PROGRESS TOWARD REACHING CALIFORNIA'S UNIVERSAL BROADBAND GOALS. BY REPORTING WIRELESS BROADBAND COVERAGE BY CENSUS TRACT ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE. GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS SENATOR DODD AND HIS TEAM THEY ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. CALLING IN SUPPORT IS SERRA BASHES FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS AND IN THE HEARING ROOM WE HAVE RUDY REYES FROM VERIZON TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU WILL BEGIN JUST REMINDED THERE ARE FOUR MINUTES FOR EACH SIDE I WOULD RECOMMEND TWO MINUTES ON EACH SIDE TWO MINUTES FREE TO MAIN WITNESSES. AND I WILL- TRY TO FORCE THAT IS AS FAIRLY AS POSSIBLE. I CEREBRA BLOCK IF YOU WOULD PROCEED FOLLOWED BY OUR RUDY REYES. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN MEMBERS THERE ABOUT JUST THE HOUSE BILL. I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME. LAST MARCH SCHOOLS PIVOTED TO DISTANCE LEARNING IN RESPONSE TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHICH REVEALED THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF ONCE AND FOR ALL CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN MAKING RELIABLE INTERNET ACCESS A REALITY FOR ALL OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. I FEES BECAME PARTNERS WITH SCHOOLS AND PROVIDING DISCOUNTED RATES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOMES WITH ACCESS TO THE INTERNET WHILE THESE EFFORTS HELP THEY'RE NOT A LONG TERM SOLUTION IN MANY CASES SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY SIMPLY BECAUSE WIRED AND WIRELESS PROVIDERS DO NOT OFFER SERVICES IN SPECIFIED REGIONS. TODAY APPROXIMATELY ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN CONTINUE TO LACKS ADEQUATE AND RELIABLE BROADBAND ACCESS WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST OF BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE IN AREAS WITH NO BROADBAND ACCESS IS CRITICAL AND THIS PROPOSAL REMOVES THAT BARRIER FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INTERNET SERVICE STRIX BAND THE REACH. SB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS BAKER BY CONFORMING CALIFORNIA LAW WITH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FEP FEDERAL REGULATION IN ORDER TO EXPAND FIVE G. DEPLOYMENT AND CONTRIBUTE TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ENSURING THEIR FAMILIES HAVE OPTION IN AFFORDABILITY AND SERVICE ESPECIALLY AS OUR STATE CONTINUES TO DEAL WITH YEAR ROUND NATURAL DISASTERS. IMPACTING THE ACCESS TO EDUCATION HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND WE'RE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EDUCATION EQUITY CHALLENGES POSED BY UNEVEN ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERSTATE DURING THE PANDEMIC STUDENTS IN OUR MOST ISOLATED REGIONS STRUGGLED THE MOST TO ACHIEVE ACCESS OUR EDUCATORS ADMINISTRATORS FAMILIES AND STUDENTS NEED FULL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET TO ENSURE THE STABILITY TO A THRIVING ECONOMY AND SB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL DEPLOY BROADBAND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TIME IS OUR ATTACHMENTS TO ADDRESS OUR BARRIERS TO DEPLOYMENT AND TO EXPAND SERVICES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A YES VOTE ON THIS CRITICALLY NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE EXACT INTO LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK YOU EXACTLY TWO MINUTES- MR REYES. C. GOOD AFTERNOON. MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ROOM EDDIE RAY S. WITH THE RISE I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STE SO. ALONG WITH- CT- AND OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE REGISTERED THEIR SUPPORT ONLINE FOR THIS CRITICALLY NEEDED BILL. TO EXPAND FIVE G. HIGH SPEED RELIABLE WIRELESS ACROSS CALIFORNIA EVERYONE ASKS WHAT THE KILLER APP IS GOING TO BE WITH FIVE G. AND BECAUSE ITS WIRELESS PEOPLE ASSUME MOBILE BUT THE KILLER APP IS GOING TO BE FIXED WIRELESS SOLUTIONS. ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS RELATED TO TELEHEALTH DISTANCE LEARNING SMART CITIES TRAFFIC CONTROL AND WHATNOT. BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT BROADBAND IN THIS YEAR OF BROADBAND. SENATOR GONZALEZ- AND THE PRIOR SPEAKER TALKED A LOT ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES LET ME SPEND A FEW MOMENTS TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. THIS BILL BILL DOES NOT TAKE AWAY ANY LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER. SAFETY OR AESTHETICS VERY CLEARLY IN THE BILL SAYS THAT- LOCAL CONTROL IS PRESERVED FOR REASONABLE AESTHETIC AND SAFETY STANDARDS. THE BILL CONTAINS A GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE THAT GOES BEYOND AND IS MORE FAVORABLE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAN WHAT IS IN THE FCC ORDER. IT PRESERVES EXISTING AGREEMENTS AN EXISTING DEPLOYMENTS AND TAKES EFFECT ONCE THIS BILL. **** THIS BILL WHILE IT DOES IT GOES A LONG WAY FOR SMALL CELLS IS NOT A SILVER BULLET AND TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BROADBAND PROPOSAL WHICH WE STRONGLY SUPPORT INCLUDING THE MIDDLE MILE COMPONENT. AND THE OTHER PIECE OF THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATION GOING THROUGH WILL BE IN ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH TO BROADBAND THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED. AND I STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT CHAIR YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ADDRESS RESPECTFULLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR REYES AND I'M GONNA TAKE A QUICK BREAK HERE TO- ESTABLISH A QUORUM- MANTA K. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SANTIAGO HERE SANTIAGO HERE PATTERSON.

YES SIR. YOU MAY PROCEED IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BEGIN. YES SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU. MANY COMMITTEE CHAIRED MEMBERS I'M STANCE OFFICE REPRESENTING THE COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT NINE. ON BEHALF OF THOUSANDS OF COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA WE OPPOSE SB FIVE FIVE SIX. THIS BILL CONTAINS OVERLY STRICT TIME LINES AND LIMITS THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PERFORM DUE DILIGENCE IN THE REVIEW OF PERMIT APPLICATIONS AND FEES. IT'S A GIVEAWAY OF PUBLIC RESOURCES AND FAVORS PROFITS OVER SAFETY. YOU HAVE A STUDY THE PERMIT PROCESS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND FOUND THAT ZERO REVIEWS CRUCIAL FOR SAFETY SHORTEN TIMELINES UNDER SB FIVE BY SIX TIE THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WORSEN SAFETY CONDITIONS. ESPECIALLY THE LACK OF ASSURANCES THAT INSTALLATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED WORKERS NOT BY SUBCONTRACTORS WHO MAIN DANGER THE PUBLIC AND WORKERS IN THE RIGHT WAY. NOTHING IN SB FIVE FIVE SIX REQUIRES THE USE OF A PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED WORK FORCE. CW A. CONTRIBUTED TO A RECENT REPORT BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFICERS AND ADVISORS. THAT DETAILS MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WITH APPLICATION TIMELINES AND FEES LIKE THOSE NASTY FIVE FIVE SIX. FOUR OUT OF FIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SAID THAT PROVIDERS REGULARLY SUBMIT INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS. NOTHING IN THIS BILL ADDRESSES THEIR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW BUT TO STRENGTHENING PENALTIES FOR NON COMPLIANCE. OVER 50% OF LOCAL RESPONDENTS REPORT THAT TELECOMMUNICATIONS DOLLARS DAMAGE AND OR FAILED TO PROPERLY RESTORE PUBLIC PROPERTY WITH LOCAL TAXPAYERS OFTEN PICKING UP THE TAB. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE INCIDENTS LIKE THE UNLICENSED CONTRACTOR IN SAN FRANCISCO WHO CUT THE GAS LINE EXPLOSION. I WORK IN BURIED IN AERIAL CONSTRUCTION OF FIBER AND COPPER PLANT WE ALREADY DEAL WITH TRAFFIC CONTROL STEPS TO PUBLIC SAFETY WITH MINIMUM OBSTACLES IMPOSED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IF ANYTHING THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TRAINED SAFETY SET UP PERSONNEL THIS BILL WILL FORCE THE RAMP UP OF THAT RESOURCES WHICH IS ALREADY LACKING. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON SB FIVE FIVE SIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SANTOS. MISTER MAYOR. MR COMMITTEE CHAIR AND MEMBERS TRANSPORTATION CITY RECORDS- IS NOT ABOUT. WHAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BECAUSE THE INTERNET ACCESS IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO THEN WHY ARE THERE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AT THIS POINT AND NOW WHY DO WE HAVE TO GIVE AWAY CITIES LOCAL CONTROL OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIVE G.

PARTNER WITH A MAJOR KERRIER. AND ALLOW THEM TO USE OUR CURRENT DO IT SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO DIG UP OUR STREETS TEMPERAMENT BY G. G. NO WHAT. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS WORTH. AND SO TO. DO THIS WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS CIRCUMVENTING THE ASPIRATIONS AND BILL OF CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING TOGETHER TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ESPECIALLY IN OUR UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE MUST WORK NOW TO CONNECT CONNECT THE TWO POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE NO MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET FOR THE SAME TIME LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR AFFORDABILITY AND THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE SPORT UNTIL THE FOR.

I THINK IT'S MODERATOR NOW WE GO TO ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS BOERNER HORVATH. WELL BY THE TIME I MOVE MY MASS THEREFORE BACK THANK YOU- YES SO I HAD TO TWO QUESTIONS- FOR THE AUTHOR AT OR THE SPONSOR CAN YOU PLEASE WALK ME THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS SPECIFICALLY WHAT ARE THE GROUNDS FOR REASONABLE DOUBT AND I'LL FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR A PERMIT AND ALSO WHAT DESIGN RECEIVING REVIEW STANDARDS WHAT A CITY BE ABLE TO USE BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS BOTH IN THE BILL AND WE HEARD A LOT OF OPPOSITION FOR THE CITIES I KNOW THE AUTHOR HAS WORKED QUITE EXTENSIVELY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A DESIGN REVIEW BUT IF IT'S- EITHER THE OFFICE OF THE PRESENTER OR THE SPONSORS COULD WALK US THROUGH WHAT THE PROCESS LOOKS LIKE I THINK THAT WOULD GIVE SOME ASSURANCE TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SURE AND THEN SECOND QUESTION MEDICINE OR HOW WOULD YOU PREFER THAT- MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN DEFER. TO MISTER RAY IS THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANKS REYES. HELLO MISTER CHAIR YOU SENATOR THANK YOU. MEMBER **** BATH OF YOUR FOR YOUR QUESTION. SO THE BILL AS YOU SAY DOES PRESERVE ALL LOCAL CONTROL ALL REASONABLE AESTHETIC AND SAFETY STANDARDS. THE BILL DOES NOT MICROMANAGE- WHAT THOSE ARE AND WHAT IS THE FCC- THE ONLY LIMITATION ON THAT. IS THAT IT CANNOT RESULT IN A DENIAL OF SERVICE SO YOU CAN'T MAKE THE STANDARD SO HIGH. THAT IT IT IT MAKES IT INFEASIBLE ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DEPLOY FIVE G. IN THE CITY. THE FIRST FIVE QUESTIONS THE SECOND QUESTION. YES SO THE SECOND QUESTION IF THE CITY DETERMINED AND IS VERY SPECIFIC I JUST GO HOME WITH MY CITY ABOUT THIS THAT THE SIGNAL- THAT A SIGNALED INTERSECTION AND THEY WANT TO PUT A SMALL SO ON THE SIGNALED INTERSECTION MY CITIES PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT- THAT THE PROVIDER WOULD REPLACE THE SIGNAL WITH ONE THAT DOESN'T MATCH OTHER SIGNALS IN THE CITY. COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT IN CASE THE SIGNAL CANNOT BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THE SMALL SELF IS THAT A GROUNDS FOR DENIAL OR WHAT IS CITY HAVE PURVIEW TO DESIGN THE NEW SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION HOLES THAT NEED TO GO UP. WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR. I THINK THE ANSWER BROADLY IS YES- THERE'S BROAD DISCRETION AGAIN AGAIN IT. AS LONG AS IT'S NOT COERCIVE BUT WHAT TEMP TECH WHAT HAPPENS DURING THIS MAKE READY PROCESS AND THE BILL. IS THAT YOU ASK FOR PERMISSION TO GO UP ON THE POLE THEY CAN SAY YES OR NO BASED ON A REASONABLE. BASIS AND THEN THEY TELL YOU IF THERE'S ANY FOUNDATION WORK OR ANY MAKE READY WORK OR WHATEVER THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. THAT IS ALL ON THE PROVIDER IT'S COSTS TO DO. SO IF ONE OF THOSE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEW LET'S SAY WE DO HAVE TO REPLACE THE FOUNDATION AND THE YOU WANT TO MAKE THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL. LIGHT LIKE OTHERS THAT'S IT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STATUS. COULD YOU PLEASE LET ME KNOW- WHAT THE PROCEDURES IF PERHAPS PROVIDER DOESN'T THINK THAT THE REQUEST IS- YOU DON'T PERMISSIBLE WHAT HAPPENS A REASONABLE. IS THAT IT IS JUST JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE HAS A HAND UP AND OUT THERE YOUR REFER YOU'RE ASKING MR REYES RIGHT OKAY SO I HAVE THE APPROPRIATE PERSON RESPONSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- SO. I TYPICALLY THE PROVIDERS TRY TO WORK IT OUT WITH THE CITY RIGHT THERE'S- LOTS OF POLLS. AVAILABLE STREET LIGHT POLES TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES UTILITY POLES. THOSE ARE ALL AVAILABLE SOURCES TO ATTACH TO WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE SO IF THERE'S A PARTICULAR POLL THAT IS- IN FEASIBLE TO DEPLOY ON. THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE THE NEXT BEST FULL. DID DID I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER. NO I'M I'M I'M JUST YOU KNOW IT SO IF YOU WERE A PROVIDER IN THE CITY SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT. WE DON'T WANT THIS THIS IS IT THIS IS WHAT WE WANT AND IT'S NOT BEING RECEPTACLE- WHAT IS THE RESPONSE OF ME DOES IT CODEWHERE DOES IT GO IF YOU GUYS CAN'T MEET. OUR ON- IF IT IS A GENUINE DISPUTE THAT WE- SEE I'D ION YEAH. THEN YOU KNOW ARE ONLY THE PROVIDERS ONLY RECOURSE WOULD BE TO YOU KNOW TAKE IT TO. THE COURT AND SAY. THAT THIS CITIES. RULES ARE SO STRINGENT THAT THEY EFFECTIVELY DENY. THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FIVE G. IN THAT CITY. BUT THAT'S- THAT'S A VERY EXTREME CASES TYPICALLY. THE PROVIDER WORKS IT OUT WITH THE CITY OF DAY. THE CITY ADOPTS THEIR OWN DESIGN STANDARDS COLOCATION STANDARDS A STATIC STANDARDS. AND USUALLY WORKS WITH THE PROVIDERS ON THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE GONNA BE FEASIBLE TO DEPLOY. OKAY NOT I JUST FINISHED UP A SOLID- OBVIOUSLY THAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE THOUGH CORRECT. AND IF SO WHAT WAS THE OUTCOME. I ASSUME MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M I'M NOT I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE BECAUSE- AGAIN WE TRY TO WORK IT OUT WITH THE CITY- BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS THE FCC IN ITS INFRASTRUCTURE ORDERED THAT THIS BILL. WOULD SAY WE NEED TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH IN CALIFORNIA DOES SAY THAT THE THAT THE STANDARDS NEED TO BE FEASIBLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T AFFECT A DENIAL OF SERVICE BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY CASE ON THAT. SURE THANK YOU THANK YOU MR IS ANY OTHER- MEMBERS HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YEAH WELL HOLE ON THAT WERE AT WORK AT THE PLACE WHERE PUBLIC COMMENT HAS ENDED MEMBERS HAVE THE PREROGATIVE TO ASK QUESTIONS HAVE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS OR MAKE COMMENTS BUT THE PART OF THE PORTION OF PUBLIC COMMENT HAS ENDED. SOME ONCE AGAIN MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- FOR ANY OF THE WITNESSES. MR HOLDER YEAH I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION PER SE I JUST KNOW THAT THESE ARE ALWAYS. FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITIES TOUGH. ISSUES TO KIND OF RECONCILE BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU'RE CREATING GREATER ACCESS- AND- EXPANDING BROADBAND WHICH AFTER LAST YEAR OBVIOUSLY WE'RE UNDERSTANDING HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR SOME COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING. VERY GOOD- BROADBAND TO HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALSO AND I'M LOOKING AT LOCAL CONTROL AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT- TURNING AWAY ANY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A- A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY INFLUENCE. HOW THESE- PROVIDERS INTERACT WITH THE COMMUNITY IN THE POLLS ARE TO GO UP SO I THINK THAT THE SENATOR HAS BASICALLY CODIFIED AS- BEEN SAID. FEDERAL LAW THAT NOW IS- COVERING THIS ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S- A FAIR APPROACH THE ADDITIONAL. AMENDMENTS SEEM TO MAKE- MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THERE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE- AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT HAPPENS TOO OFTEN BUT IF THERE'S AN IMPASSE HOW DO YOU RESOLVE THAT AND IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THE SERVICE TO GO FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE GOOD. OF A LARGER NUMBER OF FOLKS AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE APPROACH- THAT I THINK THAT THIS IS WORTH SUPPORTING I APPRECIATE OBVIOUSLY THE- THE NARROW FOCUS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS A NO LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF RUSSELL SOME OF THESE LARGER ISSUES THAT EVEN COME UP TODAY. BUT WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHAIR I'M PREPARED TO MOVE A- YEAH. THANK YOU MR HOLDER AND THE AUTHOR AND I DID TALK AND THERE'S AN AWARENESS HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL- IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING IT ON ON HIS BEHALF AND IN CONTINUE ALSO WORKING ON ON A ON A QUESTION OF EXISTING. CONTRACTS NOW IN ALL FAIRNESS THAT CAN BE TAKEN UP DOWN THE LINE BECAUSE OF THE AMBIGUITY AS TO WHAT SOME OF THAT UP TO. YOU CAN HEAR ME THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT SOME OF THAT OPPOSITION MEMBERS HAVING SAID THAT- IN THE SPIRIT OF NATURE OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING AS WELL- NOW FOR IN FEDERAL BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ASK IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- AND IT WAS AN EXCELLENT CLOSE EARLY BUT- AND IF THERE'S ANY- ANY- CLOSING.

YES THANK YOU- WE ARE PLEASED TO COSPONSOR THIS BILL WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT IN ADDRESSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITIES PUTTING LOWER INCOME STUDENTS AND DISADVANTAGED BUT WITH THE PANDEMIC THAT REALLY SHINED A LIGHT ON HOW IMPACTFUL THIS DIVIDE IS ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENT POPULATIONS ARE HOLDING COMMUNITIES CAME TOGETHER TO ADAPT TO A NEW LEARNING ENVIRONMENT PROVIDING CAPLET AND PARTNERING WITH PUBLIC TELEVISION. TO ATTEMPT TO REACH AS MANY THINGS AS POSSIBLE DESPITE HER SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS A LACK OF BIBLE IN AFFORDABLE INTERNET ACCESS REALLY HAMSTRUNG ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE QUALITY EDUCATION AT THE REPRESENT CLASSIFIED WORKERS IN THE MOST POPULOUS DISTRICT WE ARE SEEING A SIGNIFICANT LEARNING GAP AMONG OUR LOW INCOME STATE AND THERE'S A CLEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN ACCESS AND DIGITAL RESOURCES AND- IMPACT.

AND I'M A POLICY ADVOCATE AT THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. TELL TAX RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES SB FOUR BECAUSE THE BILL WOULD INCREASE TAXES ON PHONES UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO FUND THE EXPANSION OF BROADBAND PROJECTS THE DEAF AND DISABLED HEALTH HOME PROGRAM. MAKE NO MISTAKE SB FOUR IS A SIGNIFICANT TAX. CALIFORNIANS ALREADY PAY SIGNIFICANT TAXES ON THE PHONE SERVICE AND SB FOUR MAKES PHONE SERVICE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE BY INCREASING TAX. TAXES ON A TAXPAYERS PHONE BILLS. BY CHOOSING TO USE THE PHONE BILLS ACTORS AND TAX COLLECTION SERVICE. FOR NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. CALIFORNIA'S CHOOSING TO MAKE THE COST OF A PHONE LESS AFFORDABLE. ON AVERAGE A TYPICAL WIRELESS CUSTOMER IN THE STATE HE MORE THAN 23% OF THE TOTAL PHONE BILL AND FEES TAXES AND SURCHARGES TO THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY. WE ALSO QUESTION WHETHER ADDITIONAL REVENUE IS THAT NECESSARY AT THIS TIME. NOW THE CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE FUNDS FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT WHICH INCLUDES SPONSORED EARMARKED FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. CALIFORNIA ISSUE LIGHTS FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE PROJECTED SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING FROM THE BUDGET FOR THESE PROJECTS BEFORE ASKING TAXPAYERS FOR MORE. SO IN ADDITION TO THAT. THE TICKET FUNDING. MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE THE STATE IS PROJECTED TO HAVE A RECORD TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION RESERVE AND A SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS FROM THE LATEST BUDGET.

THREESEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LIVE PERSON WITH A SECOND HOLDING A QUICK ENOUGH TO SEE WHO BUT- AND I PROMISE I WILL STOP TALKING ABOUT BROADBAND AFTER HIS BILL- BUT THIS BILL IS AB I'M PRESENTING SP THREE SEVENTY EIGHT AN IMPORTANT MEASURE A KEY COMPONENT TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AS WELL. IT WILL PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AND INTERNET CONNECTIVITY- TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BY REQUIRING THEM TO ALLOW FIBER CABLES TO BE INSTALLED USING COST EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUES INCLUDING OPEN TRENCHING BORING THE MICRO TRENCHING STATUS SB THIRTY EIGHT WILL ADDRESS THIS LACK OF CONTINUITY- WHERE EVERY COMMUNITY IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW BY CREATING A STATEWIDE STANDARD FOR MICRO TRENCHING AS A DEPLOYMENT OPTION FOR BROADBAND. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE A SHELF ONCE AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER WITH CROWN CASTLE AND ERICA HOFFMAN LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL. BOARDS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. EMMA SWANSON YOU MAY PROCEED FOLLOWED BY AN MIS HUFFMAN. AND JUST REMIND IN JUNE THANK YOU FOR MINUTES BETWEEN THE TWO THANKS. RIGHT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS ROCHELLE SWANSON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER FOR CROWN CASTLE. MY VERY PROUD TO SPONSOR SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT YOU CAN ALLOW BROADBAND PROJECTS IN THE STATE G. DON'T QUIT GROWTH WITHIN TIME REDUCING CONSTRUCTION IMPACTING COMMUNITIES. THE BILL INSURANCE TO THE INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICE OF MICRO TRENCHING THE LED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO INSTALL HIGH SPEED INTERNET FIBER CABLES UNDERGROUND. MICHAEL CHANGING TECHNOLOGY CUT A TWO INCH WIDE INTO BUT IF YOU TRANSFER THE FIBER UNDERGROUND BY SIMULTANEOUSLY BACK FILLING AND SEALING. THE ENTIRE PROCESS TAKES HOURS RATHER THAN DAYS IN CARS CAN DRIVE ON THE ROAD THE SAME DAY. MY CONTENTION IS TYPICALLY 50% CHEAPER 80% QUICKER THAN TRADITIONAL OPEN TRENT STREET EXCAVATIONS WHICH CREATE LANE CLOSURES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS BEING USED IN CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED IN LOS ANGELES FOR OVER FORTY MILES OF FIBER HAVE BEEN INSTALLED ON MAKES IT MUCH. THE BILL HAS NECESSARY BECAUSE MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE HESITANT TO UTILIZE THIS NEWER TECHNOLOGY A CITY STAFFER USED TO THE OLDER MORE DESTRUCTIVE METHODS METHODS OF OPEN TRENCHING. MICRO TRENCHING COMPLIES WITH ALL UTILITY SAFETY RULES AND GOES FURTHER BY USING GROUND PENETRATING RADAR PRIOR TO INSTALLATION. QUICKER INSTALLATION OF FIBER MEANS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE CAN GET CONNECTED TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET IN DAYS INSTEAD OF MONTHS. IT'LL COMPLEMENT THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR BROADBAND BY ENSURING THAT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DOLLARS ON MAXIMIZE. AND BENEFIT RESIDENTS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL pUTILITY GREAT TO WORK WITH US ON AMENDMENTS. WE ARE NOW AND TORN UNETHICAL ON THE BILL. WE CAN ENSURE SANTIAGO AND SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON ADVANCING BLOOD IN THE STATE. AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE THAT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS HOFFMAN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ERICA HOFFMAN AND THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. COPA'S COMMITTED TO BROADBAND EXPANSION EXPANSION IN CALIFORNIA TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND IMPROVE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS THIS LAST YEAR HAS SHOWN. THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER THE STATE NEEDS TO DO ALL IT CAN TO CONNECT OUR SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS DIE SPEED INTERNET. WE SUPPORT SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR MICRO TENT TRENCHING FOR THE QUICK INSTALLATION OF FIBER FOR HIGH SPEED. INTERNET PROJECTS. THIS BILL WILL HAVE AN IMMEDIATE MEANINGFUL IMPACT BY ALLOWING FLAG OR TO BE INSTALLED. IN HOURS INSTEAD OF WEEKS. MICROTONES YOU CAN EXPEDITE DEVELOPMENT IN A FAR LESS INVASIVE MANNER THAN TRADITIONAL TRENCHING. OTHER STATE AND SCHOOLS NAVIGATE EDUCATION IN THE TIME OF COVERED NINETEEN THE NEED FOR MORE BROADBAND. ACCESS HAS BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR BROADBAND NETWORKS AND SERVICES ARE CRITICAL FOR EDUCATION BUT ALSO FOR HEALTHCARE TELEMEDICINE PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE. RURAL COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY BROADBAND ARE CURRENTLY AT AN IMMEDIATE DISADVANTAGE. AS SCHOOLS CONTINUE WITH DISTANCE LEARNING FOR SOME STUDENTS AND ALSO BATES HOMEWORK AND SCHOOL RESEARCH PROJECTS. ON THE DIGITAL PLATFORM THOSE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS NEED TO BE CONNECTED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS. HAVE ACCESS TO ALL APPROPRIATE EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITHOUT ACCESS STUDENTS WILL NOT PROGRESS AND SUCCEED. SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT AS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE BROADBAND ACCESS TO COMMUNITIES IN NEED. CSTA SUPPORT FUNDING AND STREAMLINING TO HELP ACCELERATE BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. THIS BILL WILL MAKE SURE THE STATE AND FEDERAL BROADCAST FUNDING WILL BENEFIT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS YOU NEVER GOING TO WIN ABA WILL BE GIVEN FOUR MINUTES- SPLIT BY THE TO- WE HAVE FIRST- MAYOR BILL TELOPEA BUILDER THE PENA. AND SECOND WE HAVE- JOANNA FINLEY. MADAM- I'M SORRY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER THIS IS CLAUDIA BUILDUP PENA MAYOR OF THE CITY OF THOUSAND OAKS AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT TO BE CLEAR THOUSAND OAKS DOES ACTUALLY SUPPORT BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT AND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT JERRY COLBERT NINETEEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE ALREADY A LOT OF BROADBAND PROVIDERS TO MICRO TRENDS FOR FIBER INSTALLATION IN OUR LOCAL RIGHT THAT WAY BUT IT IS DONE AT OUR DISCRETION. WHILE SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIREA LOCAL AGENCY TO ALLOW MICRO TRENCHING EIGHT UNFORTUNATELY TAKES AWAY OUR CONTROL AND AUTHORITY OVER OUR OWN RIGHT THIS WAY CITY SHOULD HAVE THE POLICE POWER TO REGULATE THE TIME PLACE AND MANNER. FOR HANDLING PERMIT. NOW SB THREE SEVENTY PROVIDE FOR EXPEDITED REVIEW AND PROCESSING APPLICANTS M. IT AUTHORIZED THE CITY TO SET FEES FOR FASTER PERMITTING. BUT IF THIS REGARD STAFF CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY EXPEDITE THE PERMIT. AT CITIES ACROSS THE STATE USE SB ONE FUNDS TO REPAVE AND REPAIR WORN STREETS AND ROADS SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT MICROSTRATEGY PROJECT WILL NOT DAMAGE YOU WILL BE PAVED STREET. HERE IN THOUSAND OAKS WHEN TELECOM PROVIDERS INSTALLED UNDERGROUND CABLE MANY OF OUR STREETS WERE DAMAGED AND WE HAD TO DO FOR REPAIR ALTHOUGH MY CREEK TRENCHING IS SMALLER WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH APPLICANTS TO CONTROL THE DEPTH OF MICRO TRENCHING THE OBVIOUS CONCERN IS THAT EXCESS OF DEATH WHAT COULD DAMAGE UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND COST. SECTOR PUTS CRACK THAT OVER TIME COULD UNDERMINE THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF OUR PAVE STREETS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I BELIEVE- MISS MISS FINNEY IS IN THE CHAMBER IS THAT ACCURATE CORRECT THANK YOU MISSED ANY YOU MAKE A SALMON HELLO I'M JOHANNA FINNEY I'M WITH THE NEVADA COUNTY TELECOMMUNICATIONS PUBLIC WORKING GROUP. I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON SB THREE SEVEN EIGHT. DESPITE WHAT THE BILL'S SPONSOR IT TELLS YOU- MICHAEL TRENCHING IS NOT- THE BEST PRACTICE OF THE INDUSTRY- ACTUALLY FIBER LATERAL DRILLING OR BORING IS THAT THE BEST PRACTICE. AND THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS ILL ADVISED FAST AND CHEAP IS NOT ALWAYS GOOD. LOCAL AUTHORITY AND THEY'RE INTELLIGENT PLANNING MUST BE PRESERVED TO CHOOSE THE MANNER IN WHICH FIBER OPTIC SHALL BE LAID. CITIES STILL HAVE THE POLICE POWER TO REGULATE THE TIME PLACE AND MANNER FOR HANDLING PERMITS GIVE ME. MAUREEN IS OFTEN THE PREFERRED METHOD OF MINIMIZING DAMAGE AND ONLY REQUIRING RESTORATION AND THE AND AT THE ENTRY AND EXIT POINTS. SB THREE SEVEN EIGHT DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE TRENCH AREA TO ITS PREVIOUS CONDITION AND DOES NOT REQUIRE THE APPLICANTS TO PAY FOR THIS RESTORATION. LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY IS DISASTROUS GOOGLE FIBER OPTICS MICRO TRENCHING PROJECT IS A CLEAR HARBINGER FOR CALIFORNIA. THE CEILING DIDN'T PERFORM WELL THE CABLES CAME OUT OF THE TRENCHES TO LAY EXPOSED IN THE STREETS LOCAL AUTHORITIES SPENT PRECIOUS TIME AND ENERGY REMOVING FIBER CABLE AND SEALANT FROM ROADS. MILLING AND PAVING TO RESTORE WALKWAYS AND ROADS SYSTEMS AND REMOVING ABOVE GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THOUSANDS OF MILES OF CONDUIT ONLY A FEW INCHES UNDERGROUND IS EXPOSED TO FLOODING FIRE DAMAGE AND VEHICLE TRAFFIC THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AFTER THE FACT THE STATE WILL SEE THAT THESE MICRO TRENCHES HAVE BECAUSE SPECIFIC ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THIS BILL PROVIDES NO STATE SUPPORT OR APPROPRIATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE DAMAGE JUST GONNA GENTLY REMIND YOU DON'T THINK I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON SB THREE SEVEN EIGHT.

YES OF COURSE THEY WOULD HAVE THAT AUTHORITY LIKE THEY WOULD CONTRACT WITH ANYONE ELSE- SO YOU KNOW THE PROVIDER WOULD WOULD WORK WITH THEM IN THAT SENSE TO DO THE BACK FELL BUT THIS IS THE MICRO TRENCHING BILL IS FOCUSED MORE ON STREAMLINING THE PROCESS OF THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING IN MANY OF OUR CITIES.

SMART POLICIES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE A STEER AB DEPLOYMENT ALONG WITH OTHER PARTS OF TRANSPORTATION TOWARDS A ZERO EMISSION FUTURE. AND THAT IS THE GOAL OF THIS BILL- IS YOUR MISSION AB TECHNOLOGY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S FUTURISTIC OR SCIENCE FICTION. IT'S THE NEAR TERM REALITY. COMPANIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SOFTWARE AB TECHNOLOGY CAN MATCH THE HARDWARE. ZERO EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGY AND MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE THE ZERO EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES WELL AHEAD OF THE AV. I IT'S A GOOD PRESIDENTE SET BEFORE EV'S ARE PUT THE WIDESPREAD USE AND THIS MEASURE SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND LABOR GROUPS. THE TIME IS MICHAEL'S MAY BE ABLE TO DRIVE THEMSELVES BUT LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE IN THIS LEGISLATURE STEER THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WITH ME ON THE LINE TO TESTIFY TODAY I HAVE A LIST OF IT URBAN SENIOR TRANSPORTATION ANALYST FOR THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. AND NADIAANDERSON SENIOR GOVERNMENT MANAGER FOR CRUISE. THANK YOU MY PROCEED BECAUSE THERE'S TWO WERE DOING FOUR MINUTES US AND- BUT GENTLY% REMIND EVERYBODY AT THE TWO MINUTE MARK THANK YOU. MR. ONE GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON AT YOUR SAN DIEGO COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ELIZABETH URBAN AND THAT SENIOR TRANSPORTATION ANALYST AT THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. YES YES IS THE NATION'S LEADING SCIENCE BASED NONPROFIT PUTTING RIGOROUS INDEPENDENT SCIENCE TO WORK TO SOLVE OUR NATION'S. AND PLANETS MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS. ON BEHALF OF UPS'S FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PLUS SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. I AM PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY I IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE HUNDRED WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AUTOMATED VEHICLES TO BE DEPLOYED A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THERE'S AN EXPERT CONSENSUS THAT ELECTRIFYING EV'S IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS TO ENSURING THAT THERE ARE SUSTAINABLE PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE RESEARCH FROM UC DAVIS FOUND THAT PERSONALLY OWNED AB IS UNLIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WITH A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE MILD COMING WINDOW PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE. AND THE EV'S ARE LIKELY TO SHIFT PEOPLE AWAY FROM LOWER EMISSION MODE. IF YES RESEARCH FOUND THE POTENTIAL FOR AB TO INCREASE EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION EVEN IN A SCENARIO WHERE POLICIES ENCOURAGE COOLING IN TRANSIT. OUR RESEARCH ALSO FOUND THAT NEGATIVE IMPACTS CONGESTION AND AIR POLLUTION WERE LIKELY TO HAPPEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IN COMMUNITIES ALREADY EXPERIENCING ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICES. WE CAN ALSO LEARN FROM THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF RIDE HAILING. WHICH USED YET AND CARBON HAS FOUND TO INCREASE EMISSIONS COMPARED TO PERSONALCARS. ACCORDING TO UCS ANALYSIS THE AVERAGE RIDE HAILING TRIPS IT 69% MORE POLLUTING THAN THE TRAINS THEY REPLACE. THESE REPORTS AND OTHERS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO DEPLOY AB IS AS AS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE EMISSIONS IMPACT AS PART OF A BROADER STRATEGY TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FOR TRANSPORTATION. THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF CALIFORNIA POLICY IT'S CLEAR WE'RE MOVING TOWARD AS YOU'RE A MISSION TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AUTOMATED VEHICLE SHOULD BE LEADING THE WAY. THIS BILL CONSISTENT WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTIONS SUCH AS THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS REQUIRING TRANSITION TO THAT IN CARD THE PASSENGER TRUCKS. CHARACTERS DRAFT FRAMEWORK- WHICH LISTS DEPLOYMENT OF YOUR MISSION AB THAT'S PART OF ITS FIRST GUIDING PRINCIPLE. AND TO CLEAN MILE STANDARD- APPROVED BY CARP THAT REQUIRES RIDE HAILING VEHICLES TO TRANSITION TO THAT. RIGHT CLEAN A REGULATED SEGMENT BUT NOT ALL EIGHTIES. JUST NOTHING ARE ALREADY DEPLOYING- AB THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB FIVE HUNDRED. THANK YOU MISS ANDERSON PLEASE. AFTERNOON CHECKING GADDA RESPECTED COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY MY NAME IS NOT A ANDERSON I'M A NUMBER OF REASONS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS TEAMS I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT CRAPPIE FIVE HUNDRED. OUR MISSION DRIVING TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WITH A MISSION TO BRING THE LOT ABOUT THE DANCE ACADEMY ACROSS. THE STATE WE CONNECT PEOPLE TO THE PLACE I THINK THE NEXT BEST A CARE. GIVER FAMILY ON THE PLANET THE TRANSPORTATION AT THE END OF THE DAY A FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED. AND IT'S PRETTY NEAT THE STATE ENVIRONMENT LOCAL NEED MORE THEIR ADMISSION BE UP ON THE BACK. AS YOU ALL KNOW TRANSPORTATION IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO AIR POLLUTION. AND OTHER HARMFUL HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS RELATED TO KIND OF TAKE THAT. I VISIBLE IN OUR COMMUNITY TODAY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT IDENTIFICATION ALONG WITH THE WIDESPREAD ELECTRIFICATION UNNECESSARY FOR MITIGATING THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. APPROVED FOR AFTER DISAPPOINTED CLEAN TRANSPORTATION REVOLUTION. A VEHICLE HAD BEEN THERE A MISSION SINCE DAY ONE AND CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN POWERED BY A 100% FOR NOBLE ENERGY. GENERATED RIGHT HERE IN OUR HOME STATE TWENTY NINETY. WHERE PAKISTAN WITH A BROAD COALITION INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR GROUP. AND SEVERAL OF OUR PEERS AND EIGHTY INDUSTRY TARGETS A PART OF THAT THAT. WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT POLITICIANS OF CALIFORNIA FEATURE BUT ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY AND I MAKE IT CLEAR INVESTMENT AND THEY'RE MISSING VEHICLES AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED THE POWER THE VEHICLE. CALIFORNIA CONCERT AT THE SHINING EXAMPLE WHAT THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION SHOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE COMING YEARS. BUT I THINK FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS THAT OFFENDER FOR HOW WE BUILD FACEBOOK FEATURE FOR TRANSPORTATION. MAKING STRIDES TOWARD MEETING I AM BESTEN CRIME CALL. WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY PARA CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY IN THE INNOVATION AND THEIR MISSION GO HAND IN HAND. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD TODAY AND EXTRACT THE POINT ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT THAT. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK ABOUT THE PAPER SB FIVE HUNDRED TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU- MISTER SHARE MY NAME IS KURT AUGUSTINE I AND SENIOR DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION WHICH IS THE TRADE ASSOCIATION OF AUTO MANUFACTURERS AND THE TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIERS OF BOTH ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY- WE APPRECIATE THE PREVIOUS AMENDMENTS MADE BY THE SENATOR TO THE BILL BUT- WE STILL ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL- REGARDING THE MANDATE ON THAT. IRONICALLY DESPITE THE- PREVIOUS TESTIMONY ARGUES THAT THIS IS INCONSISTENT WITH ST WALL STATE REGULATIONS AND STATE POLICY IT IS NOT CLEAR TO US WHY. THERE SHOULD BE SEPARATE STANDARDS FOR EMISSIONS BASED ON A VEHICLE ON WHO IS OPERATING OR DRIVING THE VEHICLE- INTO OUT THAT IS ARBITRARY AND THERE'S BEEN NO REAL WORLD RATIONALE DISTRIBUTED TO Y. THE FIFTY YEARS OF REGULATORY PROCESS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS REGULATED THE AUTO INDUSTRY ON A MISSIONS. SHOULD NOT CONTINUE AND WHY AGAIN IT SHOULD ONLY BE DONE BY A GUY WHO'S DRIVEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF LIMITING OPTIONS OF A YES THEY ARE PART OF HIS VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS DEVELOP THE VEHICLES- AND IT IS DRIVEN BY A GASOLINE POWERED ENGINE THAT IS LEGALLY DRIVEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDER AIR RESOURCES BOARD OPTIONS BUT SUDDENLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE. TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AND SALAS WITHIN US NINE SHORT YEARS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT- IT'S AGAIN WE BELIEVE THE TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THIS. IT'S HAVE A SEPARATE STANDARD. FOR V. AND IT ALSO LIMITS THE VALUE AND THE PROMISE OF OUR ECONOMY THAT CAN HAPPEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MOBILITY OPTIONS INCLUDING THE ELDERLY AND THE DISABLED AND WE RESPECTFULLY WOULD REQUEST A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MR OF THE STEAM- WE'LL MOVE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS I'LL REMIND YOU THAT STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ONLY AND WILL BE BEGIN WITH THOSE WITNESSES- IN THE CHAMBER IF THERE ARE ANY.

RIGHT FIGURES TO TURN MEMBERS THIS IS A BILL THAT AND WE JUST HEARD ABOUT AND THE SENTIMENTS BILL ABOUT A THOMAS VEHICLES THE QUESTION IS ARE WE REALLY PREPARED FOR THE INFLUX OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON EVERY LEVEL- ARE WE PREPARED ON THE PLANNING SIDE WE PREPARED ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE. WE'VE WE'VE DONE SOME STUDIES IT SHOWS THAT I THOMAS VEHICLES COULD BOTH BE AN INCREDIBLE BENEFIT FOR SOCIETY IN TERMS OF HOW WE GET AROUND IT THEY COULD ALSO BECOME MAKE THINGS A LOT WORSE- THERE WAS AN EXPERIMENT THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY UC DAVIS AND UC BERKELEY THAT MIMIC LIFE WITH THE NAVY BY PROVIDING EACH. PARTICIPANT HOUSEHOLD WITH THE SHOW FOR AND OF COURSE TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE ELSE DOING THE DRIVING HAVE FOLKS USE THE CAR MORE IN FACT THE EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT HOUSEHOLDS TRAVEL 83% MORE MILES PER WEEK WITH MORE THAN A FIFTH OF VEHICLE TRIPS CARRYING NO PASSENGERS AT ALL SAYING HEY YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T FIND PARKING THIS GO AROUND THE BLOCK A FEW TIMES WHILE I'M IN THIS MEETING. NO HARM NO FOUL SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE. CREATE A SYSTEM TO BETTER PLAN. I AM THIS BILL CREATES A COUNCIL TO DELIBERATELY PLANNED FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS THE STATE'S SAFETY TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE. EQUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL THAT'S IT'S- IT'S ALL ABOUT ALTERNATELY MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE SMART ABOUT THIS THAT WE SEE THIS COMING. AND WE PLANNED FOR IT. I WE WORK WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING INDUSTRY GROUPS AND AUTOMAKERS ENVIRONMENTALISTS. AND OTHERS WHO WE KNOW WILL BE IMPACTED BY EV'S TO DRAFT A BILL THAT PUTS CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TO. TO PROPERLY PLAN SO HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT I HAVE ELIZABETH ERVIN. FROM THE UNIT CONCERNED SCIENTISTS ALSO JACQUELINE BACK WITH WITH THE ASSOCIATION FOR UNMANNED VEHICLE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL. THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO OF THE FOUR MINUTES. NO NOT NOT DONE BOTH AT TWO. THANK YOU. MR ONE IF YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK COMMITTEE THIS IS A LIVE EVENT SENIOR TRANSPORTATION ANALYST AT THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. I AM I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT THIS TIME AS ACT B. SIXTY SIX WHICH ESTABLISHES AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIST VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY. I MADE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WITH FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR CARBON EMISSIONS AIR POLLUTION SAFETY EQUITABLE MOBILITY IN THE STATE'S ECONOMY- AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED- SOME OF THE STUDIES ADDITION POINTING IN THAT DIRECTION. THIS BILL WILL SET UP A PROCESS AND FORUM GET DEVOTED TO DIRECTING THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY TO MAXIMIZE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND MINIMIZE POTENTIAL HARM CRUCIALLY THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR REPRESENTATION OF A DIVERSE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPERTISE. AND ALSO REQUIRES THE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PUBLIC AND- INPUT AND COMMENT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE. IN FAVOR SB SIXTY SIX THANK YOU.

TWO MINUTES CORRECT. CORRECT THAT WILL NOT LISTED SO ALL ALL AT LEAST LIST ONE. THE TWO MINUTES WILL BE VERY EFFICIENT- GENERALLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES COME IN MANY DIFFERENT FLAVORS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SHOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND IS THAT MULTIPLE PARTIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO INPUT AND WE APPRECIATE THAT IT HAS A BROAD RANGE OF PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE. BUT SERVING FOR FOURTEEN YEARS WITH THE FOURTEEN YEARS IS TOO MUCH FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS TO INFILTRATE SOME KIND OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE PLEASE TURN OVER AFTER EVERY FIVE YEARS TO GET MORE POINTS OF VIEW ACROSS THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. GONZALEZ MY VEHICLES COME IN MANY DIFFERENT FLAVORS SOME ARE ACTUALLY SELF INCREASED ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES ON BOARD YOU DON'T NEED TO TALK TO ANY WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S WHAT'S BEING TESTED RIGHT NOW ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THERE'S SOME KIND OF FALSE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW YOU HAVE TO CONNECT INTO A WIRELESS CELL TOWER IN ORDER TO HAVE DRIVERLESS CARS THAT'S NOT TRUE. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS A LOT OF THINGS IS LOADED ON TO THE PROMISES OF FIVE G. THERE WILL NEVER BE DELIVERED. AND THAT WHOLE THING THE EXTENT TO DIGITAL DIVIDE AND TELEMEDICINE AND ALL PROPAGANDA YOU HERE AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO BACK TWENTY YEARS OR THIRTY YEARS HE SAID THE SAME THINGS ABOUT THE SUPER INFORMATION HIGHWAY NINETEEN NINETY THREE.

EVERYONE NEEDS FOR BROADBAND FOR THE DIVIDE. SYMMETRIC ONE HUNDRED MEGABITS DOWN ONE HUNDRED MEGABITS UP THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET MONEY ON THE DEPARTMENT TREASURY WE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME STANDARD HERE CALIFORNIA WHICH MEANS IT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY FIBER OPTIC CABLE.
