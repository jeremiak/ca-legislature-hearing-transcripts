00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:45.404
OUT. OF THE THREE PROBABLY NEED

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:46.805
POLICY GROWING TO COVER THOSE

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:48.173

ALL THESE THINGS BIG- THERE'S

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:02.888
ALWAYS.A RISK THAT IF WE DO

SENATOR MEN AND THEN CENTER-

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:05.407
TROUBLE. THANK YOU CAN AMERICA-

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.842
THE IS. WE'RE NEAR THE END OF

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.043
GUESS MY FIRST BUT SEASON IS

01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:10.846
ALLEGED. AND I WILL SAY IT'S

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:12.715
BEEN INTERESTING GETTING A

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:13.682
GLIMPSE OF HOW THE SAUSAGE IS

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:16.886
MADE- YOU KNOW I WANT TO FOLLOW

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:18.220
UP ON SHERMAN THERE'S POINT

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.822
ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE THERE

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:23.759
ARE. ITEMS IN THIS PACKAGE

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:24.326
THAT. I THOUGHT I MIGHT NOT

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:26.228
HAVE. PICTORAL CHOSEN FROM

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:28.464
SCRATCH BUT OVERALL I THINK THE

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:31.734
DIRECTION OF THIS- BUDGET FOR.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.469
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION K.

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:35.337
THROUGH TWELVE IN HIGHER ED IS

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:38.541
A VERY VERY STRONG PACKAGE- AND

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:41.410
ONE I VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT.

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:43.412
YOU KNOW I THINK FOR ME MOST

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:46.649
IMPORTANT WAS THAT WE- PAID OFF

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:48.217
THE DEFERRALS AND RESTORE THE

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:50.185
CUTS TO HIGHER EDUCATION- THOSE

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:51.720
AT AND GAVE AN ADDITIONAL COAL

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.322
INCREASE I THINK THAT HAS TO BE

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:56.625
THE BASELINE- WELL I RECOGNIZE

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:58.561
THAT THERE'S AN URGE TO EARMARK

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:00.396
FUNDS FOR PARTICULAR PROGRAMS.

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:01.931
I THINK PRINCIPLES OF FISSION

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.999
SEEM LOCAL CONTROL DICTATE THAT

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:06.468
WE TRY TO GIVE THOSE IN WHO

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:08.304
KNOW THE DETAILS OF EDUCATION

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:09.572

ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.514
APPROPRIATELY AND I THINK THIS

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:20.049
BUDGET DOES A LOT OF THAT AND I

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:21.984
THINK THAT'S VERY APPROPRIATE-

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.886
AND I GUESS I JUST. EMPHASIZE

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.421
THE BROADER POINT HERE WHICH IS

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:26.622
