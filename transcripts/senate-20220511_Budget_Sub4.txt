OKAY SERA'S DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ARE NOT HERE YET SENATOR NIELSEN YOU'RE NOT HERE YET ALL RIGHT THANK YOU NOW LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY EIGHT STUDENT BORROWER LOAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION IN INNOVATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENTS. I SHOULD MENTION I'M SORRY ITEM THIRTY- WITH THIS IS A HOLD- TO HOLD OPEN ITEM FOR- ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY SEVEN. YOU WILL MOVE ON YAK ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY EIGHT I'M SORRY DAPI. GREAT JOB MANAGER I'M CRUCIAL TIME THE CHIEF DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TEN BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNICATIONS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. OUT WITH ONE TIME GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO SIX STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS WHO FACED CRITICAL DECISIONS IN THE LATTER HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU. THE BY DEMONSTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO RESTART STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE REPAYMENT RESTART DATE IS MOVED A COUPLE TIMES. IN THE PAST YEAR BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT FUNDS BE APPROVED THIS SPRING SO WE'RE READY TO GO WHENEVER THE FIGHTING MINISTRATION TURNS STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT BACK ON. SECOND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND NONPROFITS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR EXPANDED ACCESS TO WHAT'S CALLED PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS BUT I HAVE TO TAKE SPECIFIC ACTION BY OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IF WE CAN HELP EASE CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR STUDENT LOANS FORGIVEN THAT'S MONEY THEY CAN SPEND ON OTHER THINGS EVERY YEAR INTO THE FUTURE. ARE HAVE INCLUDED FLEXIBILITY FOR THE FBI TO ADJUST THE TIMING OF OUR EFFORTS IF THE BY ADMINISTRATION- CONTINUES TO MOVE THE STATE. AND WITH FACULTY OVER MY COLLEAGUES SUZANNE MARTINDALE WHO'S AN EXPERT IN THE STUDENT LOAN FIELD. THANK YOU CHRIS AND GOOD MORNING SHARE AND MEMBERS SO AT A TIME OF GREAT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND ALL THESE FLUCTUATIONS IN FEDERAL POLICY IT IS CRUCIAL FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN REPAYMENT IN PAUSE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR OPTIONS- LEARN HOW TO SPOT SCAMS AND REPORT TROUBLING BEHAVIOR TO OUR DEPARTMENT WHICH LICENSES AND REGULATES THE STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY UNDER MULTIPLE CALIFORNIA LAWS. AND WE'RE HOME TO ALMOST FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WITH OUTSTANDING FEDERAL LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN ON POLICIES THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY EACH OTHER MANY REPEATED SHORT TERM EXTENSIONS OF THE PAYMENT BECAUSE BY THE WHITE HOUSE BUT THERE'S NO LONGER TERM PLAN YET IN SIGHT. AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND BECAUSE OF THAT BARBERS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY ANXIOUS ABOUT WHEN THEY HAVE TO START REPAIRING AND THEY'RE WARY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S MIXED MESSAGES QUITE FRANKLY WE ARE WORKING IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RUSSIA TALKING TO THEM LATER TODAY- AND THEY'RE ACTIVELY URGING STATE REGULATORS LIKE OUR DEPARTMENT. SHOULD PRIORITISE BOROUGH OUT THIS SYSTEMS AS MUCH POSSIBLE PARTICULARLY BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST WHEN NOT PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS WAIVER EXPIRES THAT DAY IT'S NOT GOING. SO THE WAY TO HOLD THESE LOANS IT'S VERY. I KNOW IT FOR MY- OWN EXPERIENCES SOMEONE IS HAD STUDENT LOANS WHO WENT THROUGH THE PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM AND FINALLY. GOT MY OWN LOANS CANCELED. EVEN AS A LAWYER AND AN EXPERT IN THIS SPACE I'VE BEEN DOING WORK ON STUDENT LOAN POLICY FOR ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS NOW. I STRUGGLE TO RESOLVE MY OWN PROBLEMS WITH MY LOAN SERVICER OVER THE YEARS AND FOUND THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING MY LOANS TO BE CONFUSING. SO IT IS TO OVERSTATE THE NEED PEOPLE HAVE FOR CLEAR ACCURATE INFORMATION. UPDATES AND REMINDERS ABOUT KEY DEADLINES OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTEND EVENTS AND ASK QUESTIONS OF EXPERTS AND BETTER AWARENESS OF HOW TO FILE COMPLAINTS WE CAN'T RESOLVE A PROBLEM ON YOUR OWN. IN FACT WE HAVE A COLLEAGUE AN EMPLOYEE OR DEPARTMENT- HIDDEN IN PAST TRYING TO GET HER SERVICER. TO UPDATE HER PAYMENT COUNT FOR THE PURPOSES OF PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS YOU FELT THEY WERE UNDER COUNTING HER PAYMENTS. SHE FILED A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OR PROGRAM TEAM GOT INVOLVED IN THE SERVICE OR CORRECTED THE PROBLEM. AND OUR EMPLOYEE RECEIVED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT CANCELLATION- SO THE ABILITY FOR A STATE REGULATOR TO INTERVENE. IMPACT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT EVERY. BARRING CAN SUCCESSFULLY. THEIR LOANS AND UP. SERVICE THE PUBLIC SERVANTS INCLUDING OUR OWN STATE EMPLOYEES WITH FEDERAL LOANS CAN ACCESS THE BENEFITS OF PSLF. THIS PROPOSAL WITH A NAIL ENABLE US TO SCALE UP RESULTS LIKE THIS. EXPANDING OUR OUTREACH CAPACITY WORKING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND ENSURING THAT WERE SUPPORTING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS CAN ALSO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED COUNSELING OR LEGAL ADVICE TO BORROWERS DIRECTLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU S. FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT. FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY KIND OF EVERYONE FROM THE FINANCE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OF THE SENATE. GREAT THANK YOU L. A. O. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT. THE MANAGER WE THINKING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE PROPOSAL IN JANUARY AND AT BEGINNING ON PAGE FORTY EIGHT. SEVERAL CONSENSUS GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED APPROACH TO ASSISTING STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. OUR FIRST CONCERN IS THAT THERE ARE MANY EXISTING SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON STUDENT LOANS AND REPAYMENT INCLUDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS FROM COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T IDENTIFY WHAT SPECIFIC GAPS IN INFORMATION REMAIN AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THESE EXISTING RESOURCES AND HOW THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WITH INVESTORS CATS. MOREOVER SOME OF THE PROPOSED ACT IS MADE DUPLICATE EXISTING RESOURCES. FOR EXAMPLE A PORTION OF THE PROPOSED FUNDS WOULD GO TOWARD DEVELOPING A BARI FACING WEBSITE ALL THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH ADMINISTERS THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM ALREADY NINETEEN SUCH WEBSITE. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS IN THIS WAY. I AM TIMELY INFORMATION ON STUDENT LOANS IT IS IN MANY WAYS AN ONGOING ACTIVITY WITH A NEW COHORT OF BORROWERS ENTERING REPAYMENT EVERY YEAR. WHILE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COULD REACH CAR BUYERS IN THE NEAR TERM THERE AREN'T CLEAR PROVISIONS FOR SUSTAINING ACTIVITIES AFTER THE FUNDING EXPIRES. CONCERN HERE IS THE BACK COULD BE TO SHORT LIVED IMPACT WHILE CREATING PRESSURE FOR THE STATE TO FIND ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE TIMELINE. FINALLY WE DO THE CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE CONTINUED FEDERAL CHANGES ON THIS PROPOSAL. AS THE DEPARTMENT HAS DESCRIBED AS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT A PAUSE ON STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS AT THE START OF THE COOK AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND HAS SINCE EXPANDED THAT PAUSE SEVERAL TIMES. AT THIS STAGE IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER REPAYMENTS WILL RESUME ON SEPTEMBER FIRST IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED. FOR THAT DATE WILL BE FURTHER PUSHED BACK FOR THE PORTION OF LOANS WILL BE FORGIVEN ALTOGETHER. AMERICANS INTO THIS UNCERTAINTY COULD IMPACT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT AN ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION CAMPAIGN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. GIVEN THESE CONCERNS WE THINK LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. NONETHELESS IF THERE IS INTEREST IN PROVIDING FUNDING FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ASSISTANCE IN THE COMING YEAR WE'LL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH STAFF TO EXPLORE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS.THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT I JUST SUCH A WONDERFUL DEMEANOR SAYING SO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS- OKAY THANK YOU AND WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP DISCUSSION BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BUT I FIRST WOULD LIKE IF THERE CAN BE A RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE L. A. O. ADDRESSED. OF COURSE DURING HUNDRED TO RESPOND TO THAT AGAIN AS I NOTED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS URGING US TO TAKE ACTION IN THE SPACE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S MATERIALS ARE. GOING TO REFLECT WHAT IS FEDERAL POLICY I WILL NOT REFLECT ANY OF THE STATE LAWS ALSO GOVERN THE STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY WE DIRECTLY LICENSE. FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE EXAMINE THEM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE AND WE TAKE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. AS I MENTIONED WE RECENTLY RESOLVED A COMPLAINT THAT WAS FILED BY ONE OF OUR OWN EMPLOYEES I'M HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE CAN PROVIDE A LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF WASHINGTON DC. WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN HOSTING AND CO HOSTING WEBINARS WHERE OVER SOON WE'RE WE'VE BEEN TAKING LIVE CULINARY THAT'S THE KIND OF- THAT'S THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE WANT TO EXPAND ON IT. AS A PART OF THIS PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE ARE HERE AS A RESOURCE. THERE DOES YOUR STATE FINANCIAL REGULATOR TO PROVIDE. TO PROVIDE SERVICES NOT JUST IN TERMS OF MATERIALS ON OUR WEBSITE WHICH INCLUDES BOTH FEDERAL STATE AND NONPROFIT RESOURCES AGAIN YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE THAT ON DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S WEBSITE BUT WE ALSO POST WHEN WE HAVE UPCOMING EVENTS AND WEBINARS WHERE PEOPLE CAN SHOW UP TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN AND LEARN AND- ALSO ASK US QUESTIONS. WE ALSO INCLUDE OUR OWN CONTACT INFORMATION AT THE YOU'VE SEEN A SPIKE IN BOTH COMPLAINTS AND ALSO JUST EMAIL ENQUIRIES ASKING FOR. INFORMATION ABOUT OPTIONS BECAUSE OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FEDERAL POLICY FARMERS ARE DISTRUSTFUL OF FEDERAL RESOURCES ON THEIR OWN THEY WANT TO VALIDATE IT WANNA SECOND OPINION IF YOU WILL. I'M AND SO WE ARE OFTEN GETTING QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE WHO WENT TO THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S WEBSITE. THEY'RE STILL NOT SURE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRUST IT AND SO WE HAVE A WE ARE FINDING THAT WE PLAYED A KEY ROLE HERE IS THAT IS THE STATE FINANCIAL REGULATORS IN BEING A RESOURCE. TO STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS OF VALIDATE OR GIVEN THE MISTRUST OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT THIS TIME AND AGAIN I WILL KNOW TO TERMS OF THE ONGOING CONCERN ABOUT YOU KNOW THE SHIFT IN THE PAYMENT RESTART. DOT MAY BE THE CASE YES THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE RUN SHORT TERM EXTENSIONS OF THE PAYMENT POLICY BUT THE. P. S. L. F. WE'VE- THAT IS STATUTORY THAT EXPIRES IN OCTOBER. THIRTY AND THEY CELL. OF PUBLIC SIR. HERE AROUND THIS. THAT MAY ACTUALLY NOW. L. TO GET A- CRY TOWARD PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS WHICH IS A HUGE BENEFIT- AND SO THEY DO NEED TO TAKE ACTION BEFORE. OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST THE DEADLINE WILL NOT MOVE I HOPE THAT IS HELPFUL. YEAH WE ARE ASKING FOR IT. THE REQUEST IS FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE MAJORITY OF IT GOES TO MARKETING. LESS THAN HALF OF IT GOES TO ACTUAL STUDENT BORROWER ASSISTANCE GRANTS. AND THEN NOT EVEN A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR CONSUMER SERVICES AND MOST OF WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. WHERE IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CONSUMER SUPPORT. SO THE NUMBER SIMILAR OUT OF WHACK TO ME. A MANAGER I CAN THINK THAT THAT WOULD CONNECT TO CRYSTALS CHIEF DEPUTY COMMISSIONER- THE WITH THE- IF THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IS APPROVED AS PART OF THE BUDGET THE FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE ON JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND I THINK WE- SCHEDULE THE MONEY- A BIG TEND TO- ADVERTISING AND- COMMUNICATIONS ANOTHER CHUNK TO- TO NONPROFITS WHERE WE WOULD GIVE DIRECT GRANTS TO NONPROFITS TO HELP STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS AND THEN A SMALL VERY SMALL CHUNK TO OUR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND OUR HOTLINE. BASED REALLY ON THE TIME YOU GET THESE DEADLINES CONTINUE TO BE AUGUST THIRTY FIRST IN OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST OUR ABILITY. BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH- SAMPLE THE CAL MONEYSMART GRANT PROGRAMS CENTER BRADFORDS BUILDING WITH OFF AUTHORIZED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH ASKING NONPROFITS TO APPLY FOR GRANTS EVALUATING THOSE GRANTS TO PULLING THE MONEY INTO THE FIELD AND THEN THAT THOSE NONPROFITS ACTUALLY SERVING BORROWERS BECAUSE OF THESE DEADLINES WE FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE BEST A PLAN THAT THE FUNDS BUT WE'RE HAPPY DAY- CHAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT IF THE LEGISLATURE THINGS A DIFFERENT DEPLOYMENT OF THE FUNDS IS WARRANTED. THANK YOU I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO CENTER COME HERE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. YES I DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- I TOO HAD THE ISSUE- OR THE QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THAT MEDIA CAMPAIGN. WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY HERE AT THE STATE- DOING MEDIA OUT REACH AND- I JUST I ALWAYS WONDER DO WE REALLY GET THE BEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO- TO GET. MANY GET PARTICIPATION AND SO I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT- AND BUT I BUT I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS- WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY TO GET TO STUDENTS. TO LET THEM KNOW THAT- THAT THERE ARE OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR THEM SO THAT THEY CAN EITHER REDUCE THEIR STUDENT LOAN OBLIGATIONS OR MAKE ARRANGEMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN. GET THEM REFINANCED IF THAT'S IF THAT'S A POSSIBILITY- SO I'M I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN TELL US- IF YOU SEEN AN INCREASE IN THAT COMPLAINTS- OR AN INCREASE IN ENQUIRIES AND I GUESS AND- ENQUIRIES ARE DIFFERENT THE COMPLAINTS AND IF YOU- KEEP THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH US. THANK YOU SENATOR YES INDEED WE ARE SEEING INCREASED COMPLAINTS AND EMAIL WE GET EMAIL INCREASE THROUGH MULTIPLE CHANNELS SO WE'RE HAPPY TO. CIRCLE BACK TO GET MORE PRECISE NUMBERS BUT I CONSULTED WITH YOU KNOW WE HAVE A PURSUANT TO THE STUDENT OUR BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH PASSED IN TWENTY TWENTY. THAT CREATED AN OFFICE OF THE STUDENT LOAN OMBUDSPERSON SO WE HAVEN'T OMBUDSPERSON WHO IS NOW IN CHARGE TO. SERVE AS A CONDUIT FOR INFORMAL ENQUIRIES AND SHE REPORTED TO ME YESTERDAY THAT WE SIGN IN SHE SAW. I THINK GET 83% INCREASE IN EMAIL INCREASE JUST TO HER OFFICE. IN THE MONTH OF APRIL COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE BELIEVE THAT IS IN PART DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE HAD HOPED HOSTED AND CO HOSTED. WEBINARS WE OFTEN. WE PARTNER WITH. LEGAL AID NONPROFIT OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT WERE EXPANDING OUR COLLECTIVE REACH TO MAKE SURE THE BARBERS KNOW THAT WE ARE HERE. TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND AFTER EVERY EVENT WE RECEIVED A SPIKE AN INFLUX INFLUX OF INCREASED JUST TO THE OMBUDSPERSON IN ADDITION TO WE ARE WE ARE SEEING MORE A COMPLAINTS HERE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND I THINK THAT IS. A PRODUCT OF US DO. REACH RAISING AWARENESS USING SOCIAL MEDIA. PROVIDING THESE EVENTS PEOPLE NOW SEE THAT WE ARE EXPERTS WHO ALSO HAVE A REGULATORY AUTHORITY HERE AND AN ABILITY TO TAKE COMPLAINTS AND STUFF WE BELIEVE THAT THAT TREND IS GOING TO INCREASE MONTH OVER MONTH AS WE STEP UP OUR- EFFORTS. AND CERTAINLY IN THE LATTER HALF OF THIS YEAR I'M SHOULD SHOULD MONEY BE APPROVED- WE DON'T ANTICIPATE ON A DRUG THE BIG INCREASE IN BOTH FORMAL COMPLAINTS THAT GO THROUGH OUR LICENSING PROGRAM. AS WELL AS EMAIL INCREASED. THROUGH OUR OMBUDSPERSON. WE'RE GETTING. A YEAR YES ACCORDING. I JUST WANT OTHER ARGUMENT A LITTLE BIT TO TENDS TO BE A PART OF YOUR- SO. OF THE DEADLINE HERE RIGHT LIFE. AUG THIRTY FOR. OCTOBER FIRST. THE THIS IS A- ONE TIME GENERAL MONEY IN A REALLY SHORT WINDOW SO THERE'S NOT REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HIRE VERY YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO WORK ON THIS. THERE'S NOT REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET NONPROFIT UNDER CONTRACT AND HAVE THEM HIRE PEOPLE TO WORK ON THIS IN THAT WINDOW. SO WHILE I- I THINK YOUR QUESTION ABOUT IS AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN THE BEST USE OF THESE FUNDS AND IT WILL IT BE SUPER EFFECTIVE. GIVEN THE TIGHT TIME WINDOW IN THESE ARE DEADLINES THAT THE STATE DOESN'T CONTROL WE THINK THAT THAT IS OUR BEST. OPTION FOR CALIFORNIA'S BORROWERS RIGHT THESE PEOPLE ARE SIX MONTHS OUT OF COLLEGE ARE MORE WHO WERE IN THAT REPAYMENT WINDOW. TO TO ACCESS AS MUCH OF THAT PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS OR- OR- REPAYMENT OPTIONS TO GET THEM ACCURATE INFORMATION IN THAT WINDOW. WE THINK THAT'S OUR BEST OUR BEST BET. VERY GOOD THAT'S THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND IT IT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE A LITTLE BIT UNUSUAL IN THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T CARE. WE DON'T CONTROL THE TIMELINE AND- THIS PROGRAM IS EXTREMELY. IMPORTANT TO US. TO STUDENTS SAID- THE FORMER STUDENTS SAID THAT- MONEY SO I DO I DO APPRECIATE- I. MY QUESTION FOLLOW UP WAS GOING TO BE FIVE- BEEN INVOLVED IN- WEBINARS WITH- THE SMALL BUSINESS- AGENCY AND THAT THAT'S BEEN- THAT'S BEEN REALLY I THINK REALLY PRODUCTIVE IN TERMS OF GENERATING QUESTIONS TO OUR OFFICE AS WELL AS TO- THE OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS- ADMINISTRATION AND- THOSE DON'T COST. A LOT OF MONEY TO PRODUCE AND I THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING WITH THE QUESTION ABOUT- AREN'T THERE WAYS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO IT- THAT ENCOURAGES. PEOPLE TO ASK QUESTIONS TO GET ONLINE AND THEN ONCE IT'S ONLINE THEY CAN SEE IT AT THEIR LEISURE SO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER COMING YEAR I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO SAY I- I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS INFORMATION ANYWHERE AND YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY CUSTOMERS- MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE I'M SURE WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTNERING WITH YOU ALL- TO HELP SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH THE THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR DISTRICTS WHO. PROBABLY HAVE STUDENT LOANS THAT THEY NEED TO GET- REPAID SO- I KNEW THIRD MISTER SCHULTZ DUDE CERTAINLY KEEP MENTIONING THESE THREE DEADLINES JULY AUGUST AND OCTOBER AND SO I GET IT YOU WANT THE MONEY BUT- IT MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE DEAD ENDS BUT WE DO HAVE CONTROL OF OUTREACH MECHANISMS. THE MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE SHARING INFORMATION EFFECTIVELY AND IN A WAY THAT IS TARGETED IN TO THE CONSTITUENTS THAT NEED IT THE MOST AND I THINK THAT'S THE THING THAT WE ARE. THE- CARE AND CAREFUL ABOUT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO DUPLICATE EFFORTS. AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO CHASE DOLLARS WHEN YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A PLAN. AND WE HAVE SEEN. FROM MULTIPLE OTHER EXAMPLES OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL. IN WHO WERE REACHING OUT TO AND IN WAYS THAT WERE YOU OUT REACHING. TO CREDIBLE VALIDATORS OF THE INFORMATION WHO ARE IN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WHO CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF CONNECTING WITH. THE CLIENTS AND THE CUSTOMERS THAT WERE TRYING TO REACH. SO AND ONCE AGAIN I JUST THINK THAT THE ROOT OF THE RATIOS FOR THE DOLLARS SEEM A LITTLE OUT OF WHACK I MEAN. YOU KNOW MISS MARTIN DEL YOU SAID THAT. ONE OFF AS IT'S SEEN AN INCREASE IN COMPLAINTS THAT EIGHTY THREE PERCENT. AND JUST ONE MONTH WHICH WOULD BEG THE QUESTION OF THEN WHY THE- ALLOCATION FOR CONSUMER SERVICES IS THE SMALLEST. BUT WE'LL JUST DO THE HOLD OPEN. AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON THE ITEM NUMBER THIRTY NINE THANK YOU- THIS IS CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT IS THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HERE. YES GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT. I WILL THANK YOU. MY NAME IS JENNIFER IRVINE I'M THE CHIEF BUDGETS AND ACCOUNTING WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. AS CEO IS REQUESTING LIMITED TERM RESOURCES TO SUPPORT CRITICAL ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECTS AS THE PROJECT MOVES TOWARD SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION THE NEED FOR DEDICATED LEGAL RESOURCE TO BE IMMERSED IN THE PROJECT EFFORTS AND PROVIDE ADVICE. EXPERT CONSULTATION AND SUPPORT TO THE PROJECT IS REQUIRED. THE DEDICATED BUDGET MANAGER IS NECESSARY TO EFFICIENTLY MANAGE THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSEEING THE DEVELOPMENT ANALYSIS ALLOCATION MONITORING AND RECORDING OF THIS YES YES PROJECT BUDGET AND EXPENDITURES. THE SECOND ITEM BEFORE YOU IS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO SWAP THE CENTRAL SERVICE COST RECOVERY FUND PORTION OF THE CS PS RESOURCES REQUESTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET 2100% GENERAL FUNDS. AND WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FINANCED. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT. THANK YOU BUT I CAN'T THIS IS KIND OF. FINANCE NOTHING CONTACTED BY. GREAT THANK YOU L. A. O. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT. GOOD MORNING BRIAN METZGER WITH THE L. A. O. WE RESTATE OUR RECOMMENDATION FROM FEBRUARY THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE EIGHTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION NOW ALL GENERAL FUND. IN DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION IN FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSED PROJECT UNTIL SPRING FINANCE LETTERS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD INCREASE GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES ON THIS PROJECT BY ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. BUDGET PROPOSAL AT THE SAME TIME THE UPDATED PROJECT TIMELINE REFLECTS AT LEAST A TWO MONTH DELAY FROM THE PROJECT TIME WHEN THAT WAS PRESENTED IN JANUARY WHICH MEANS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT BEGIN UNTIL APRIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AT THE EARLIEST- INCREASE GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES ON THE PROJECT AS WELL AS DELAYED LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF THE PROJECT. PLAN HEIGHTENS OUR CONCERNS FROM FEBRUARY THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT IT NEEDS TO APPROVE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING AND THAT THE ASSUME PROJECT TIME LINE REMAINS LIKELY UNREALISTIC AND THAT THE TIMELINE LIMITS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. I'M CONSISTENT WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DEFERRED CONSIDERATION OF ANY POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION FUNDS. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DISCOUNT TO INTEGRATE THE PAYROLL SYSTEM AND FISCALE- THE EXTENT OF THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS WILL DEPEND ON THE SYSTEM GREATER. THAT IS SELECTED FOR THE S. P. S. PROJECTS AND SO WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION THE DEPARTMENT- SYSTEM. I'M SORRY CAN YOU YOU RESTATE- FROZE. AND YOU JUST NOW I CAN HEAR YOU NOW BUDGET ARM WRESTLING LAST SO JUST RESTATE THAT FOR THE RECORD I APOLOGIZE- COLLEGE EYES. UNLESS YOU DID IT. CONSISTENT WITH OUR- RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE PAYROLL SYSTEM- WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DEFERRED ITS CONSIDERATION OF ANY POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FIFTH SCALP TO INTEGRATE FISCALE WITH THE STATE CABLE SYSTEM- HOW THESE TWO SYSTEMS WILL BE INTEGRATED WILL DEPEND. ON THE SYSTEM INTEGRATOR VENDOR THAT IS SELECTED FOR THE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT AND SO WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING FUNDING WITHOUT KNOWING FULLY HOW INTEGRATED THE TWO SYSTEMS WILL BECOME. AND SO WE THINK THAT'S FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BEGIN ITS PLANNING EFFORTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR ARE REASONABLE SO IT'S ABOUT HALF OF THEIR REQUEST BUT THE REMAINING FUNDING WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE DEFERRED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND FINALLY WE REYES NO SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- BUT IT MINISTRY TO POSITIONS THAT WERE REQUESTED BY THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT- WILL NOW OPEN THE DISCUSSION TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR KABIR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I DO WELL I IT'S MORE A COMMENT AND THEN THE QUESTION I THINK- I'M- VERY SENSITIVE TO IT CHECKS- IT TO DO PREPARATORY WORK WHICH IS USUALLY THAT CHANGE MANAGEMENT. PART OF THE OF THE PROGRAM IF YOU DON'T DO IT THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU JUST REPRODUCE WHATEVER THE PROBLEMS WERE WITH THE ORIGINAL- TECHNOLOGY AND- AND YOU'RE YOU'RE PLAYING CATCH UP. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER- WHEN YOU DIDN'T PLAN FROM THE BEGINNING SO I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THE- CONCERNED ABOUT- HAVING THE INFORMATION YOU NEED. AND HAVE IT BE IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THE SOLUTION WHEN YOU'RE PICKING THE VENDOR- IN ORDER TO THEN BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT WHEN YOU'RE MOVING INTO INTO FISCAL I FISCAL IS NOT AN EASY TRANSITION FOR DEPARTMENTS TO. TO MAKE IT STICK AND I THINK FOR THEM WE THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA TAKE- SO I'M I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT AND I- I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO SPLIT THESE INTO. DIFFERENT PIECES AND WE CAN TAKE THEM UP AT A DIFFERENT TIME TO CREATE CREATE THE INFORMATION. THANK YOU SENATOR KABIRU YEAH I TO THINK IT'S M. WISER TO ALREADY HAVE YOUR VENDOR IDENTIFIED OR AT LEAST. A SMALLER POOL OF POTENTIAL VENDORS THAT HAVE THE STRINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS KIND OF TRANSFER SUCCESSFUL. AND MUCH MORE STREAMLINED AND WE'VE SEEN SO MANY EXAMPLES OF- PROCUREMENTS THAT HAPPEN AND IT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CUSTOMIZED PROGRAM AND SOMETHING OFF THE SHELF AND THEN THINGS GO SIDEWAYS AND THIS SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WHERE YOU WANT TO HAVE YEAR. HE'S CROSSED IN YOUR EYES DOTTED BEFORE YOU GET THE MONEY- SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A HOLD OPEN ITEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON YOUTH THANK YOU YES TO ISSUE FORTY. DEPARTMENTAL ONBOARDING IN CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM ADJUSTMENT AND CONSULTANT TRANSITIONING CONSULTANT WORKLOAD TO STATE STAFF THAT WAS A LONG SENTENCE.

AND THAT TEN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AS YOU WILL RECALL THERE ARE WHEN THE SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED THERE WERE TEN DEPARTMENTS THAT ALREADY HAD MODERN ERP SYSTEMS.

OF THEIR SYSTEMS TWO OF THOSE ARE ON EXPIRING NOW IN A READY TO TRANSITION ON THIS GALLON THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSFER RIGHT.

INCLUDING SOME FROM OUR ANALYSIS IN THE AGENDA. AS WELL AS PROVISIONAL BY BILL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR FISCAL TWO ON BOARD- ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENTS IF POSSIBLE- THANK YOU HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA OPEN THE DISCUSSION OF QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR COPY OR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- I I'M NOT. I'M NOT SURE I BUY MY THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO YES ALTHOUGH IT IT IS- I THINK IT IS- THE FISCAL HAS- HAS ACHIEVED LOT OF THE GOALS THAT WERE SET UP INITIALLY AND THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING WHEN YOU'RE DOING AT- THE PROJECT. AS LARGEST FISCAL- I THINK IT TOOK LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE BUT- RIGHT RIGHT HERE GOOD REPORTS. IT'S A IT'S A COMPLICATED PROCESS TO MOVE OVER DEPARTMENTS FROM THEIR OWN SYSTEMS TO A TO A MASTER SYSTEM AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- TO BE ABLE TO FINALIZE IT AND- AND HAVE THE HABIT. HAVE THERE BE A BOOK OF RECORD I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TIME. I'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THE STATE. FARM HASN'T FINISHED ITS ITS REPORTING- FOR SOME OF THE FISCAL YEARS. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T MADE THE TRANSITION FOR TEST FOR SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC HAVE CONFIDENCE. THAT WE ARE SPENDING THE MONEY THE WAY THAT WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO SPEND IT AND THAT WE'RE CLOSING OUT- COUNTS AS WE- AS WE END THE YEAR AND WE SAY. WE'RE WE'RE PHYSICALLY SO WE'RE FISCALLY SOLVENT AND SO- WE NEED TO WE NEED TO GET THERE SO THAT- SO THAT WE- WE CAN ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY THE WAY THAT WE SAY AND THAT THE DEPARTMENTS ARE MANAGING IN IT IN AN EFFICIENT WAY SO APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE. THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE- ON FISCO I KNOW IT IT IS BEEN- MORE DIFFICULT THAN I THINK ANY OF US THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE BAD- IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE FINALLY GETTING TO THE END AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. THANK YOU SENATOR KABIR I HAVE NO QUESTIONS THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEMS I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL- SO THAT ACTUALLY CONCLUDES PART A OF THE AGENDA.

RIDLEY THOMPSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT. I SEE NO ONE I HEAR NO ONE. THERE MUST BE NO ONE. ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR COMING YEAR- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THEY SEEM TO BE TALKING A LOT TODAY BUT NOT ASKING QUESTIONS. THIS REALLY IS THE SENATE PROPOSAL- ON HOUSING AND- AND HOMELESSNESS AND SO AYE AYE I WANNA. WANNA CALL OUT THAT- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON I THINK THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN WORKING VERY CAREFULLY AND CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR TO. BOB PUT AN EMPHASIS ON THE NEED FOR MORE HOUSING AND IN PARTICULAR ON AREAS WHERE- WE CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND- HOUSING AND THE LACK OF HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. IS AFFECTING EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY. AND I DON'T THINK WE GET THE CREDIT. FOR PUTTING UP THE RESOURCES TO IT TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE INTO HOUSING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE- IN MY REGION. WHEN COMMUNITY CELEBRATE THEIR OPENING AT. AM ONE OF THE MOTELS AND CONVERTING IT TO HOUSING IT'S THE CITY AND THE COUNTY THAT GET TOGETHER THAT SHE KANSEN THEY TAKE PICTURES AND THEY NEVER THEY NEVER MENTION THAT IS STATE FUNDING THAT MAKES THIS POSSIBLE SO I. I'M HERE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD NEED IN IT WITHOUT THE STATE AND- WE ARE PARTNERS IN THIS AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE PARTNERS AND WHAT I'M REALLY PROUD OF IS THAT. THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR A FIRST TIME HOME BUYER PROGRAM. AND- WE'VE- MADE SURE THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN HELP PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY WANT TO BUY THEIR FIRST HOME TO GET INTO- TO GET INTO IT THEIR OWN HOME IT'S THE BEST WAY TO BUILD pWEALTH AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN. WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT. IN EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT ALL OF THAT ALL OF THE FUNDS ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED AND SO I'M I'M REALLY PROUD OF THIS- MONEY HERE IT'S NOT AN AFRICAN IT'LL NEVER BE ENOUGH BUT- WE'VE WE'VE SAID IT IS A PRIORITY AND IT'S REFLECTED HERE AND I WANT TO- I'M HOPING THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR ARE- IN SUPPORTIVE. OF THIS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO. BEING ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITY SINCE SAY THERE ARE RESOURCES- AND- WE HEARD YOU AND- AND WE ARE YOUR PARTNER SO. THAT STILL HAVE TO SAY NO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR CABALLERO I ALSO DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I DO THINK. THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BUCKETS FOR FUNDING BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY. KINDS OF SOLUTIONS. TO THE ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS IN UNAFFORDABILITY. AND THE SOLUTIONS MAY LOOK DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHAT PART OF THE STATE YOU LIVE IN- AND HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO ACCESS RESOURCES. AND THE CAPACITY OF THE PARTNERS THAT THE STATE HAS- TO WORK WITH. ACROSS ACROSS THE STATE SO. I APPLAUD THE FACT THAT THOUGHT WAS GIVEN INTO HOW WE CAN BE DIVERSE- IN OUR ABILITIES TO SUPPORT. THIS REALLY CRITICAL. CRISIS AND I TO AGREE SENATE A COUPLE YEAR OFTENTIMES. THE STATE DOESN'T GET ANY LOVE EVEN WHEN WE'RE WRITING CHECKS IN AND I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE SO. WE WANT SOME LOVE OKAY- THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD OPEN AND WE ARE NOW MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TE. A DIVISION OF STATE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS IN H. C. D. WOULD YOU. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL FIRST TIME IT WAS A TEST THAT WAS A TEST WE'RE NOW MOVING THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS PROGRAM- WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT. I SEE YOU THINKING THIS A GREAT MISS LORD THIS. THANK YOU INTO THE SMALLEST OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE COMMITTEE STUFF IS ALSO ASKING TO PRESENT THIS ITEM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET INCLUDES THREE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO STUDY AND PLAN A STATE FUNDED FIRST TIME HOME BUYER PROGRAM WHICH WOULD BE KNOWN AS A CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL FIRST TIME HOME BUYER PROGRAM. TREASURE'S OFFICE SUBSEQUENTLY CONTRACTED WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORWARD TO STUDY THIS ISSUE IN THE REPORT IS SUMMARIZED IN THE AGENDA THE SENATE MAJORITY PLAN INCLUDES ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL TWENTY THREE ALONG WITH ONGOING FUNDING FOR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE BUDGET PLAN ENVISIONS INTERNAL MARIN IN FUTURE YEARS TO PROVIDE A ONE BILLION PER YEAR FOR A FULL TEN YEAR PERIOD AFTER THAT TIME THE REVOLVING NATURE OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE ABLE TO PROGRAM TO CONTINUE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STATE RESOURCES OTHER THAN- ANNUAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT CONCLUDES OUR BRIEF DESCRIPTION I BELIEVE YOU HAVE OTHERS SPEAKERS TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE REPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE OTHERS SPEAKERS- I DIDN'T YOURSELF SO THAT WE CAN FROM YOU. WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO NEXT I THINK I SEE MISTER SHADE FOR. READY I'M SURE THAT AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES IS JIM SHIVERED STATE TREASURER I KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND ON THE STUDY THAT'S BEING PERFORMED WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED AB ONE FORTY IF PROVIDED FUNDS FOR A STUDY TO BE UNDERTAKEN BY THE STATE TREASURER IN CONSULTATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THE STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DREAMS CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL PROGRAM. THE ENABLING LEGISLATION PROVIDES AT THE STUDY MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE NO LATER THAN ONE YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE. IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THE TREASURER RELEASED A DETAILED RFP ENCOMPASSING THOSE LEGISLATIVE GOALS AND THE INTENT OF AB ONE FORTY. AND SOUGHT SPECIFIC DETAILED PROPOSALS FROM QUALIFIED CONSULTANTS EXPERIENCED IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HOUSING FINANCE OR MORTGAGE BANKING PROGAMS. AFTER AN EXTENSIVE SOLICITATION AND EVALUATION OF THOSE RESPONSES A CONSORTIUM LED BY CALIFORNIA FORWARD WAS SELECTED TO PERFORM THE STUDY. THE INVASION PROGRAM CONTEMPLATES MAKING HOME OWNERSHIP MORE AFFORDABLE BY REDUCING THE INITIAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS OF SUCH OWNERSHIP FOR LOWER AND MODERATE INCOME CALIFORNIANS. PLANNERS ALSO INTENDED TO ENABLE AND ENCOURAGE HOMEBUILDERS TO SELL MORE NEW ENTRY LEVEL PHONES AT PRICES THAT ARE MORE ATTAINABLE BY PURCHASERS IN THIS DEMOGRAPHIC. THE PROGRAM WOULD ESTABLISH A STATE SPONSORED CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL FUND WHICH WOULD COVER A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INITIAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS OF THE HOME PURCHASE IN EXCHANGE FOR A PARTIAL UNDERSTOOD OWNERSHIP STAKE IN THE HOME. THE SILENT PARTNER OWNERSHIP WITHIN BENEFICIALLY OWN A MINORITY SHARE OF THE HALL THIS APPROACH IS FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS A SHARED APPRECIATION MORTGAGE. A SHARED APPRECIATION MORTGAGES GENERALLY STRUCTURED AS A GOOD FOR MOM ON WHICH NO PAYMENTS ARE DUE UNTIL THE HOME IS SOLD TO THE NEXT BUYER OR IN SOME CASES THE FIRST MORTGAGES REFINANCE. AND AT THAT TIME THE SUBSIDY MUST BE REPAID ALONG WITH THE AGREED UPON SHARE OF APPRECIATION. THROUGH THIS APPROACH LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS COULD BENEFIT FROM THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME HOMEOWNERS AND BUILD EQUITY. SPECIFICALLY THE CONTRACTOR RISING FROM THE R. F. P. REQUIRES THE SELECTED A VENDOR TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK PROPOSAL THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE CLEARLY HOW I WOULD EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF ENTRY LEVEL HOUSING STOCK. FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS AND TO. FURTHER THAT DISCUSSION AND GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON PROGRESS I WILL NOW TURN TO MICHAEL WEINBERG THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CALIFORNIA WHO IS THE PRIME CONTRACTOR ON THIS ENGAGEMENT. GREAT THANK YOU CALIFORNIA COURT WORK AND THEN I MY UNDERSTANDING CHAIR AND NO I AM NOT THE NOT THE CEO CALIFORNIA. HARD JOB. I DO HAVE SOME SLIDES. I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THIS PRESENTATION PRETTY QUICKLY THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF pTO LANDSCAPING AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS SO- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY WHEN IS MICHAEL WEINBERG I'M CEO OF CALIFORNIA FORWARD. MOVEMENT TO MAKE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND GOVERNMENT WORK FOR EVERYONE EACH YEAR WE HOST THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT IN HOUSING AND HOMEOWNERSHIP HAS BEEN AREA WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS BEEN VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP OF PRESIDENT PRO TEM ATKINS AND CENTER COPY GYRO. AND MANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS WORK AND AS SUCH WE WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO BE CHOSEN BY THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE FOR THIS PROJECT AND IT'S BEEN A DELIGHT TO WORK WITH TREASURE MINOR STAFF ON IT GREATLY APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY AS WELL TO WORK WITH MANY MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION A. B. C. S. H. H. C. D. N. ESPECIALLY COLLEGE AFRAID TO REFINE AND IMPROVE THIS PROPOSAL. WE WERE ALSO VERY LUCKY TO WORK WITH AN AMAZING TEAM ON THIS PROJECT AND YOU MAY BE HEARING FROM SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS DURING THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS A JOURNEY ADVISORS AND CSG ADVISORS HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTE DREAM TEAM FOR THIS WORK COMBINING POLICY KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN A WAY THAT WAS BEEN REALLY FANTASTIC TO WORK WITH. OKAY SO I KNOW THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION SO THIS IS THE ONLY SLIDE THAT I WILL SPEND TO QUOTE ADMIRING THE PROBLEM NOW BUT I WANT TO CALL OUT TWO THINGS IN. PARTICULAR FIRST. YOU ARE STRUGGLING HOUSING. FALL ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE STATE HOMEOWNER. ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SERVE PEOPLE IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE INCLUDING IN ITS HIGH COST AREAS. THE BAY AREA IN PARTICULAR IS SEEN IT'S MEDIAN HOUSING PRICE RISE THREE TIMES HIGHER. THAN SOME OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. SAKIN IT IS DIFFICULT TO PROMOTE HOMEOWNERSHIP WITHOUT HOMES FOR PEOPLE TO OWN. SO I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THE LEGISLATURE IS DOING TO WORK ON INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING HOMEOWNERSHIP ARE TRULY STRIKING. AS SUCH WE CANNOT WAIT UNTIL MORE HOUSING IS BUILT FOR THESE COMMUNITIES TO BEGIN TO BUILD THE GENERATIONAL WEALTH THAT THEY WERE LOCKED OUT OF IN DEEPLY DESERVE. SO IN ADDITION FOR TO A PROGRAM THAT IS GOING TO WORK IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE WE NEED A PROGRAM THAT IS GOING TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS ESPECIALLY IN THE STATE'S BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. ALRIGHT SO SINCE THIS IS A BRIEF PRESENTATION AND NOT A LONG SEMINAR THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN HELP ACHIEVE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO REVIEW THEM ALL IN DETAIL THIS MORNING. WHAT I WANT TO CALL OUT HERE IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS OTHER AGENCIES AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. RAFIC AND THOROUGHLY DESERVING OF YOUR SUPPORT AND WE WERE DELIGHTED TO SEE ALLOCATIONS TO THOSE PROGRAMS MADE IN THE SENATE'S BUG BUDGET PACKAGE AND WE SUPPORT THEM ENTIRELY. THE PROGRAM I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO COMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS WITH A PARTICULAR APPROACH THAT IS SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO THE HOMEOWNERSHIP CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE NOT ADDRESSING TO OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND IT IS DESIGNED TO DO IT ON A SCALE THEY WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON RACIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUITY IN THE STATE. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THE OTHER PROGRAMS IS THE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE COMES OUT OF REPAYING IT COMES OUT OF THE APPRECIATION OF THE HOME. THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM A FORGIVABLE LOAN THAT IS PAID FOR ALMOST ENTIRELY BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AND HENCE DOESN'T RECYCLE MUCH OF THE MONEY TO HELP NEW HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND THE STATE DOESN'T MAKE MONEY ON THIS PROGRAM THE MONEY THAT THE STATE GETS BACK FROM SHARED APPRECIATION GETS USED TO HELP ADDITIONAL HOMEOWNERS AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS A REVOLVING INVESTMENT FUND. INSTEAD OF A ONE TIME PROGRAM. ALSO DIFFERENT FROM MORE CONVENTIONAL FIXED INTEREST SECOND LOANS THAT ARE PAID FOR BY THE HOMEOWNER. REFINANCING OR SALE. TO BE CLEAR BOTH OF THESE OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND USEFUL BUT THEY DO NOT SOLVE ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN PROMOTED HOMEOWNERSHIP. OKAY SO AS WE SET OUT TO. WORK ON THIS PROJECT WE REALLY WANTED TO HAVE A NUMBER OF KEY GOALS IN MIND SO I'M GONNA GO OVER THOSE GOALS AND HOW THIS SPECIFIC PROGRAM ADDRESS SYSTEM. FIRST WE REALLY WANT TO PROVIDE A LARGE AMOUNT OF DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE I TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR RACIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUITY. AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE PRIEST SOMEWHAT SMALLER NUMBER OF BORROWERS WE DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN SPEND SO MUCH MONEY IN THE MARKET THAT WE JUST INFLATE THE MARKET GENERALLY. AND DON'T ACTUALLY HELP OUT WITH- THE SPECIFIC POPULATIONS WE WANT TO REACH WE WANT TO SUPPORT REAL WEALTH ACCUMULATION TIED TO HELP BRIDGE THOSE ECONOMIC AND- EQUITY GAPS. WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS ASSISTED OVER TIME THROUGH RECYCLING THE MONEY. WHICH I TALKED ABOUT AS A KEY DIFFERENCE WITH A FORGIVABLE LOAN PROGRAMS. AND THEN WE WANT TO COMPLEMENT THE EXISTING HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS BY SERVING NEW TYPES OF BORROWERS SO HOW DOES THIS PROGRAM DO NOT. IT REDUCES THE INCOME REQUIRED TO PURCHASE THE MEDIAN PRICED HOME BY OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS NOW I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT HERE NOT ALL HOMEOWNERS AND ESPECIALLY NOT ALL. FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERS FIRST GENERATION HOMEOWNERS ARE GOING TO BE PURCHASING A MEDIAN PRICED HOUSE IT'LL BE USING THIS NUMBER FOR A MEDIAN PRICED HOUSE BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT SOME BUYERS ARE GOING TO BE SEEING. IN THE HIGHER COST AREAS THAT ARE LAST SERVED BY THE STATE'S EXISTING PROGRAMS. BUT IT LOWERS THE DIE- THE INCOME NECESSARY SUBSTANTIALLY WHICH IS THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM. SECOND THE CREATES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OUR WEALTH OVER FORTY YEARS IT WILL CREATE OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN BORROWER WELL. WHICH IS MORE. THAN FIVE INDEED EXPECTS INR. I A NUMBER OF ON INCLUDE US AND LIST IN PRO. AND NOW AGAIN I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE RISK BIN. IT WAS OVER HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS. AS WELL SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THIS SIMPLE LIST INTEREST PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE GREATER RECYCLING THROUGH THE APPRECIATION. IT DOES ALL OF THIS AT A LOWER TOTAL COST TO THE STATE AND WITH GREATER DOWNSIDE PROTECTION FOR THE BORROWERS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF HOW WE DESIGNED THE PROGRAM. SO I JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE. SLIDES TO GO THROUGH AND THEN HAPPY TO ANSWER YOURQUESTIONS SO HERE ARE SOME OF THE STATISTICS THAT I'VE BEEN MENTIONING- THIS YEAR DEPRECIATION PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE A 17% DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE- WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THESE BORROWERS. RECEIVING OTHER DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER PROGRAMS ARE FROM FAMILIES WE DON'T REQUIRE ANY DOWN PAYMENT FROM THE BORROWERS HAS INTO THAT DOT COM YEAH IT ISN'T AS IMPORTANT. FOR THE HOMEOWNERS THE WONDERFUL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORK DONE BY CAN THAT. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS ARE RUN BY ADAM REALNESS HASN'T REALLY SHOWN THAT THE KEY IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR SUPPORT AND COUNSELING PRE AND POST PURCHASE FOR THOSE BORROWERS THAT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE AMOUNT OF KORAPUT SKIN THAT THEY HAVE ANY GAME. CAUGHT ONE TRADE OFF IS. SORT OF ALMOST. YOU KNOW COUNTER INTUITIVELY BECAUSE THE BORROWERS WILL NOT TAKE ON AS MUCH OF THAT IN A SHARED APPRECIATION PROGRAM GOD THEY PAY OFF THAT DEBT MORE SLOWLY AND IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER UNDER THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM. FOR THEM TO REACH THE 80% LOAN TO VALUE ACCESS AND IT DOESN'T OR SOME OTHER PROGRAM SO WANT TO BE CLEAR IT REALLY TAKES A MOSAIC OF SOLUTIONS IN ORDER TO. ADDRESS ALL THE NEEDS OF THE HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS ONE BIG TILE IN THE MOSAIC BUT THESE OTHER PROGRAMS REMAIN VITAL. SO LET ME JUST DON KING WITH THAT CALL OF SCENARIOS BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION- THAT EXISTS. IN FIVE IN THESE PROGRAMS. AND JUST SO YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT PURCHASING. WITH A SINGLE FAMILY HOME- THE HOME BUYERS A SMALL DOWN PAYMENT THEY CAN GET THAT FROM OTHER PROGRAMS THE CALIFORNIA DREAM PROGRAM PUTS IN A CHUNK OF THAT TIME AND THEN TIE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MORTGAGE. ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO CALL OUT HOW WE DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM. IN THE DOWNSIDE SCENARIO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER THE GREAT RECESSION DAY REMEMBER HOW PEOPLE ENDED UP UNDERWATER THE WINNING DESIGN THIS PROGRAM THE PROGRAM ITSELF TAKES MORE OF THE HIT. IN A DEPRECIATION SCENARIO AND THE HOMEOWNER EVEN UNDER DEPRECIATION OVER TIME ENDS UP BUILDING THEIR EQUITY IN THE PROGRAM SO THAT IN ALL RIGHT SCENARIO THAT'S NOT OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR BUT WE NEED TO DESIGN FOR IT. THE OTHER SCENARIO IS WHAT WE CALL THE EXPECTED SCENARIO IT ENVISIONS ACTUALLY A SLIGHTLY LOWER LEVEL OF HOME PRICE APPRECIATION THAN WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA TO BE CONSERVATIVE. BUT IN THAT SCENARIO OBVIOUSLY- AND THAT HOME BUYERS EQUITY GOES UP SUBSTANTIALLY THE PROGRAM- IT MAKES MONEY AND- AND THEN THE FIRST MORTGAGE GET PAID OFF. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY AGAIN THE STATE DOES NOT MAKE MONEY ON THIS PROGRAM THIS IS THAT MONEY IS PLOUGHED BACK INTO THE PROGRAM TO HELP OTHER HOME BUYERS WHICH WE THINK IS A REALLY CRITICAL FEATURES HERE- AND- THAT. PRO TEAM I'M- FOLKS IN A JOURNEY ADVISED CSGN. THE DESIGN SHARED APPRECIATION PROGRAMS ACROSS THE NATION AND INCLUDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THIS STATE. AND I JUST WANT TO DRAW THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND IN WHAT WE'RE PRODUCING HERE WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO PROVIDE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM MADE THE SAME STRONG RATE OF RETURN FOR EQUITY INVESTORS IN THE PRIVATE MARKET PROGRAMS ARE DOING. THEY ARE FINE BUT WE PRODUCES SUBSTANTIALLY MORE WEALTH FOR THE HOMEOWNERS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION THAN SOME OF THOSE PRIVATE MARKET OPTIONS. AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK THAT THIS IS A REALLY GOOD COMPLEMENT TO THE EXISTING PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. SO ME JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING HOW APPRECIATIVE WE ARE OF PRESIDENT PRO TEM ATKINS FOR ADVANCING THIS PROPOSAL TO TREASURE MOCKED FOR OVERSEEING THE PROJECT. AND WE HAVE A TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY HERE TO RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE LAST CENTURY AND BUILD EQUITY IN THE STATE THROUGH BUILDING ACTUAL EQUITY FOR FAMILIES IN OUR STATES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU AND NOW MR WEBER YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER FOLKS- THAT MIGHT EITHER BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS OR MIGHT ALSO BE PRESENTING SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE- THAT. RENDON CHAIR YEAH. THEY WILL BE A PART OF THE FORMAL PRESENTATION OKAY BUT THEY'RE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THE ONE HAND. SIDE FOR ANY YOU KNOW VERY TECHNICAL QUESTION OKAY PERFECT ALL RIGHT SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO. BACK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR A DISCUSSION SENATOR COVER YOUR- DO YOU HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS ACTUALLY I DO HAVE A QUESTION FRIENDLY- SO I REALLY- I LIKED THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- FOR GOING OVER IN DETAIL HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD WORK. I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE PART THAT I LIKE THE MOST WELL THERE'S TWO PIECES ONE IS THAT. THE TRADITIONAL MODELS ARE A GRANT. GRANT PROGRAM AND SO IT'S FINITE ONCE YOU MEET HIM WHEN TO USE THE GRANT FUNDS FOR DOWN. PAYMENT ASSISTANCE- IT BEAT A YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH FINDING IT IN ORDER FOR THAT PROGRAM TO CONTINUE- WE DID THIS IN IN OUR CITY FOR- A NUMBER OF YEARS AND AT THAT TIME. A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT WOULD GET YOU INTO- YOUR FIRST HOME- BY THE END OF THE PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE- PRESSURE FROM SILICON VALLEY- WE HAD TO INCREASE THE GRANTS TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT ONCE YOU. ONCE YOU USED UP YOUR PART OF MONEY THERE WAS IN THERE IT WAS GONE. AND AND THE HOMEOWNERS BENEFITTED I'M THOSE FAMILIES- IT WAS IT WAS IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THEIR LIVES BUT BUT THERE'S A FINITE NUMBER THATYOU CAN HELP IN THAT INSTANCE- THE OTHER MODEL IS ONE THAT SAYS- THAT. XBT YOU DON'T GET TO KEEP HOME AND- THAT'S GOT ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS THE PRINCIPLE ONE IS THAT. IT'S NOT REALLY YOUR HOME YOU'RE JUST RENTING IT DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME YOU'RE LIVING IN IT AND SHOULD YOU NEED A LARGER PAIR YOU CAN'T USE THE EQUITY IN THE HOME IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT LARGER PAIR. AND WE SEEN THAT IMPOSED ON FARMWORKERS- ALL OVER THE PLACE AND IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR- BUT IT KEEPS THE PROPERTY AFFORDABLE- IN PERPETUITY WHICH IS WHAT SOME GROUPS REALLY LIKE- AND I PERSONALLY THINK IS- IS DISCRIMINATORY QUITE FRANKLY IF I'M GONNA PAY A MORTGAGE I WANT TO KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO. BENEFIT FROM THE- FROM THE EQUITY. IN A MINUTE TAKE REAL GOOD CARE OF IT SO THAT THAT EQUITY IS UP AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE SO THIS THIS REALLY- PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUND TO CONTINUE TO EXIST AND FOR THE HOMEOWNER TO BE ABLE TO SHARE. TO SHARE AND BENEFIT FROM THE EQUITY AND I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST BRILLIANT SO THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IN IN TERMS OF A LONG TERM STRATEGY IS- WERE YOU ABLE TO CALCULATE- ASSUMING SOME SOME RISKS. IN THIS KIND OF A OF A PROGRAM- HOW LONG OR- HOW. HOW FAR OUT THAT THE MONEY IS LIKELY TO. CONTINUE TO BE UTILIZED MAN I KNOW THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE YOU GOT TO LOOK AT THE CRYSTAL BALL AND IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA BUT- IF I THINK THERE'S SOME PROJECTIONS ARE PROBABLY. BE ME YEAH IT IS IN FACT A DIFFICULT AND THEREFORE I WILL HAVE IT OVER TO MAKE IT. PETER WHO HAS THE SOME OF THE LONG TERM PROJECTIONS OF THAT- HI ABILITY TO USE THE FUNDS ACTUALLY OUT TO SIXTY YEARS I BELIEVE. MY COULD YOU WATER- SHOWS WHY ELEVEN. I THINK IT MIGHT BE USEFUL AND ALSO IF YOU COULD IN THAT- IF YOU COULD. LET US KNOW WHAT THE OVERHEAD. IN TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE OF THE FUND WOULD BE SURE. I WILL DO THAT. CAN MAKE IT BIGGER OKAY. BURKE CHAU EIGHT HERE'S WHAT WE DID IN MOSCOW CRUISING ON A SHARED APPRECIATION WE'VE ALSO DONE AN ANALYSIS SINCE SIX SIMPLE INTEREST BUILDINGS FOCUSED ON THE SHARED APPRECIATION PROBABLY GETTING NEED TO READ IT TO US BECAUSE I YES. OKAY THREE TV'S THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US ARE ARE THE SMALLER ONES ARE YES AND HIGH UP OKAY. OKAY FINE SO THE FUNDS WILL MEET FIRSTHAND FOR THE QUESTION ABOUT THE COST OF THE PROGRAM SO. THIS WAS DESIGNED AND MODELED IN THE TOWN OF SPENCER MODELING FROM LAST TWO MONTHS. COM FOUR INVESTMENT OF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FROM THE STATE FOR TEN YEARS THINGS FIXED AMOUNTS FROM. TO MAKE LOANS TO MAKE THE ACTUAL SECOND MORTGAGE LOANS THESE SHARED APPRECIATION MONTHS. WE'VE ALSO BUDGETED. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR MINISTRY OF COST. ON BEYOND YOU KNOW YEAR AFTER YEAR THE ON YOUR TENT BUT STILL THE SAME HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WAS ADEQUATE. FOR THE HOME PURCHASE COUNSELING AND SERVICING AND OTHER COSTS SO WE'VE BUILT THAT. FALL INTO INTO THIS. IN THE- THE TOTAL TAXPAYER FUNDING OVER THESE OVER THE MANY YEARS WOULD BE FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATION OUT FORTY YEARS. WHICH AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF TEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. COST SO THAT'S WHAT THE COSTUMES. SO NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE STATE'S DOING BY CREATING THIS DEDICATED REVOLVING INVESTMENT FUND. ARMS WITH OUT SO. IN THE BEGINNING YEARS THE PRO. IT SERVES. SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED- BORROWERS A YEAR A LITTLE UNDER A THOUSAND SOCIAL DEPEND ON WHAT PRICES PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAY. BUT THAT'S OUR ESTIMATE. HIM SO IT'S STARTING BY SERVING SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED BORROWERS YEAR OVER TIME IS THE REPAYMENTS COME BACK. THIS DEPENDS ON THE APPRECIATION RATE. ARMS WERE ABLE THEN TO TAKE THE MONEY AND HELP SUBSEQUENT BUYERS IN ORDER THIS FORTY YEAR PERIOD WE'RE HELPING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES. ARMS SO IT CONTINUES ON IS A RECYCLING PROGRAM. AND THE TOTAL PRICE. OF THE HOME PURCHASED. WITH ARMED WITH THIS MUCH IN THE STATE'S MONEY IS THE KEY ARM BECAUSE OTHERWISE PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BUY THESE HOME TO THIRTY EIGHT GOING DOLLARS. WE PROVIDE FOR SEVEN DOLLARS OF LAW FROM. SO STARTING WITH THE SAME BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE WE'RE RECYCLING IN APPRECIATION. AND WE NOW LOOK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH WAS WHAT IS THE BORROWER SURE OF THE HOME PLEASE SHE H. BECAUSE AFTER ALL. THEY ARE PAYING SOMETHING TO US IF WE PUT UP 17% OF THE PURCHASE PRICE THE STATE PUTS UP. THE STATE GETS 17% APPRECIATION OF OUR OR GETS 83% OF THE APPRECIATION. SO WHAT HAPPENS OVERALL TO THE TOTAL APPRECIATION ARE WE TAKING SO MUCH FROM THE BORROWER THEY WERE LIMITING THE TOTAL HOUSEHOLD WEALTH IS CREATED. NO WE FOUND WAS THAT OVER TIME WE'RE CREATING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF HOUSEHOLD WEALTH FOR BORROWERS IN STATE. AND THE PORTIONS THAT IS FOR YOU CORRECT AT THE END OF THAT FOUR YEAR PERIOD THE STATE HAS MONEY TO STILL DO IT WHEN THOSE BORROWERS WHO ARE STILL OUTSTANDING G. MAKING LOANS ON THE STATE GETS BACK THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER TIME THAT'LL HELP FUTURE BORROWERS SO WE FOUND. THAT THE NET COST FROM THE STATE FOR INVESTING WITH BORROWERS IS ROUGHLY CREATING TWENTY IS ROUGHLY CREAM TWENTY TIMES THE AMOUNT OF HOUSEHOLD WEALTH WITH THE STATE ITSELF IS INVESTING WITH ITS OWN FUNDS SHOWS THE VERY EFFICIENT PROGRAM FOR HELPING BUILD HOUSEHOLD WEALTH FOR LOTS OF BORUSAN. STATE IN THE KEY THING. MAYBE THE MOST THINGS THAT SHE TO CREATE. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE RATE OF BEING IS GONNA BE. IN ANY YEAR AS- EVERYBODY SISTAN TRUMP LAST YEAR'S WITH PRICES GOING UP 40% BECAUSE OF APPRECIATE. IS CAN MATCH THAT. SO THE- IF PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE FROM. THE STATE GETS MORE MONEY TO HELP SUBSEQUENT BUYERS OTHERWISE YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE JUST GETTING BACK THE MONEY YOU LANCE FOR SOME SIMPLE INTEREST RATES. IF PRICES HAVE RISEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO HELP THE NEXT FIRE SO THE WHOLE PURPOSES THIS IS OUR PRICES GO UP A LOT YOU CAN CONTINUE HELPING BUYERS WITHOUT A ROADING. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU CAN HELP. AT THE SAME TIME IF PRICES ARE FLASHED BORACAY'S KNOWS THREE SHE H. SO THERE'S N OBLIGATION. TO PAY ANYTHING- OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL PRINCIPLES SO WHICH INTENDED TO. WORKS WHETHER REACHED WHETHER POLLUTION IS HIGH OR IS LOWER IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE TO SERVE BORROWERS IN A FAIR WAY. THAT'S MY SUMMARY THE MODEL THANKS GENE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT SOME AN EXCELLENT. AND I REALLY LIKE THIS PROGRAM I THINK IT IT- IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE FOR PEOPLE TO. BUILD BUILD EQUITY IN WEALTH BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT IS THE ABILITY TO STABILIZE YOUR FAMILY AND- AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THE STATE DOES IS- IN IN- IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY ON THE HOME THE HOMES- THIS HELPS TO STABILIZE COMMUNITY STABILIZE FAMILIES AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATED IN THE THANK YOU SO MUCH I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS THIS IS JUST REALLY IMPRESSIVE. THANK YOU SENATOR KABIR ALSO I. ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS. THE RIGHT TRACK- FOR HOW WE WORK TO ADDRESS HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE ENTRY INTO THEM. THE 17% SEEMS TO BE STATIC YES. I'M IN THE CENTER OF IT SEVENTY BURKE 17% DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE. YES OKAY SO MY SORT OF- I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IN RELATIONSHIP TO MY DISTRICT WHICH IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE- AND ALSO IS A DISTRICT THAT IS BEING CHALLENGED BY XCELERATED GENTRIFICATION. AND SO ANY THOUGHTS ON. HOW WE ALLOW OR ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS ARE ABLE TO. COMPETE FOR HOMES IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE- I WOULD NOT WANT IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE TO BE THAT FOLKS ARE PUSHED INTO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE MEDIAN PRICE- YOU KNOW IS A NUMBER THAT PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE. HAVING CERTAIN COMMUNITIES PURCHASE RIGHT AND SO WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT FOR AYE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YEAH ABSOLUTELY LET ME LET ME SAY TWO THINGS CORRECTLY FIRST- ACTUALLY WE'RE DESIGNING I CAN'T YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY THE SECOND TIME WE'RE DESIGNING IT SUCH THAT YOU CAN. THE PROGRAM WITH A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD YOU CHOOSE- WE RECOMMEND NO MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT- THE NUMBERS HERE- WE'RE PROPOSING ARE 17% AND I THINK ANOTHER KEY ISSUE HERE IS THAT- YOU KNOW SAY LEGISLATORS GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT THEY WANT TO PROVIDE. IN THE ENABLING LEGISLATION OBVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATING AGENCIES ARE YOU KNOW GOING TO MAKE. VARIOUS DECISIONS IN THAT REGARD. BUT PERHAPS I COULD TURN IT OVER QUICKLY TO IT TO KATE COLLINS TO TALK A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT. THE RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION. AND THANK YOU. SO I IN RESPONSE THE DESCENDING WE'VE DEBATED DEEPLY- BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO RESTRICT PEOPLE EITHER TO BEING IN THE PLACE. THAT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT TO TELL PEOPLE WHERE THEY CAN BUY A HOME SO THE REASON WE SET THINGS THE WAY WE HAVE AS WE TRY TO. ACCOMMODATE FOR A HIGH ENOUGH- SHARE THAT PEOPLE COME BY IN THEIR COMMUNITY THEY COULD CHOOSE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE- THAT WAS INTENTIONAL WE LOOK REALLY CAREFULLY AT THAT. THERE'S A HUGE VARIANCE IN BOTH HOUSEHOLD INCOME AS WELL AS MEDIAN HOUSE PRICE ACROSS THE STATE AND WE WANTED TO SAY EVERY YOU'LL SEE AS MANY TRADITIONAL DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WILL OFFER. A NUMBER LIKE A LIMIT FOR THE INCOME AND A LIMIT FOR THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE AND HERE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT AS A SHARE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE FOR JUST BACK. WE ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT. AS YOU KNOW IT TO MICHAEL'S POINT AS THE ADMINISTRATOR THINKS THROUGH HOW THAT HOW THIS PROGRAM IS DISTRIBUTED THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED. I HAVEN'T WE DO BELIEVE THERE WILL BE RESERVATIONS FOR DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND I THINK THAT THE STATE HAS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO THINK ABOUT. HOW BEST TO SERVE AND I CAN BE THERE CAN BE IT CAN PLACE BASED ELEMENT TO THAT THAT WE THINK- WELL WE'LL TRY TO HELP WITH THAT WITH JUSTICE YOU BRING UPGRADE. THANK YOU AND WITH YOU WHEN YOU SAY I'M SORRY WHEN YOU SAY RESERVATIONS DO YOU MEAN RESERVATIONS LIKE I'M MAKING A RESERVATION AT THE RESTAURANT READY ME RESERVATIONS LIKE HESITANCY. NO I'M SORRY. YOU'RE TAKING A POOR I KNOW THAT'S A BIT. PROBABLY BETTER. AS MANY MEETINGS I'M I TAKE A POOR AND RESERVE OKAY FUNDS FOR THIS GROUPS AND SO WORK I MEAN THAT THERE'S AN ABILITY TO TARGET TO THE GROUPS THAT THAT YOU WANT TO OVERTIME THERE HOW YOU DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS. ADULT ACCOMMODATE ANY DISPLACEMENT SHALL BE ABLE TO. MADAM CHAIR DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE ON A PRE OWNED THIS CRITICALLY ADDRESS THIS QUESTION AS WELL HI THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF. OUTREACH IN THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND GOT SOME GREAT DIRECT FEEDBACK THAT I THINK IS RELEVANT. I DON'T MIND. OKAY GOOD. GALA GREAT THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR- AS MICHAEL MENTIONED WE WE'VE SPOKEN THROUGH CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS WE SPOKEN WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE PRIMARILY HOUSING COUNSELORS. I SEE A VICE MORTGAGE ORIGINATORS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD CONSISTENTLY WAS THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM THIS ADDS A GREAT NEW TOOL TO THE TOOLBOX IN CALIFORNIA FOR CREATING FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS- BUT ONE THING THAT FOLKS CONSISTENTLY GOT BACK TO US WITH WAS. THIS IS A FAIRLY COMPLEX PROGRAM AND IN AREAS SUCH AS LOS ANGELES IN THE BAY AREA WHERE FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS ARE REALLY STRUGGLE THERE NEEDS TO REALLY BE AS AS MANY RESOURCES IN SUPPORT AS POSSIBLE FOR HOUSING COUNSELORS. TO EDUCATE FAMILIES ARE THAT PERHAPS DON'T THINK THEY CAN AFFORD HOMEOWNERSHIP THAT PERHAPS HAVE TRIED. EXISTING FIRST TIME HOME BUYER PROBLEMS- I PROGRAMS AND ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THEM ALSO REALLY ENSURING THAT WE MAXIMIZE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND HOUSING COUNSELORS- WE THINK WILL BE A GREAT ANTIDOTE. TO BOTH SOME OF THE INHERENT COMPLEXITY THAT'S PROGRAM AND ALSO ENSURING THAT THAT FAMILIES REALIZE THEY DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY CAN STAY WHERE THEY WANT TO WE'VE BUILT AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS WE THINK REASONABLE IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS PROGRAM. SO THAT FOLKS CAN STAY WHERE THEY ARE OUR GENTRIFIED OUT AREN'T JUST PLACED OUT AND WE THINK THE KEY TO THAT IS REALLY RESOURCING AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND HOUSING COUNSELORS. I SUPPORT THOSE FAMILIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- SO I DO THANK YOU FOR SHARING BECAUSE I ALSO THINK THAT EDUCATION IS KEY NOT JUST ABOUT LETTING FOLKS KNOW THAT THIS IS A POTENTIAL PROGRAM THAT WILL EXIST BUT ALSO EDUCATING FOLKS ABOUT THE PRICE DIFFERENTIALS THAT ARE VERY REAL ACROSS THE STATE- RELATED TO. HOW EXPENSIVE HOMES CAN BE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE- AND SO I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW LIKE THERE AREN'T PRICE THRESHOLDS BECAUSE I COULD CONCEIVABLY HERE PEOPLE SAY WOLVES MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PURCHASE A LIKE I DON'T WANT THIS TO GO TO A HOME THAT COSTS ZERO ONE MILLION DOLLARS WHY DO YOU NEED A ONE MILLION DOLLAR HOUSE. WHEN THE REALITY IS MAYBE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STILL WORKING CLASS- THAT'S JUST HOW MUCH IT COSTS YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE MARKET- OR YOU DON'T WANT A SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW CERTAIN ZIP CODES ARE EXCLUDED- BECAUSE FOLKS SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE TRYING TO LIVE. IN COMMUNITY A THEY SHOULD STAY IN COMMUNITY B. AND I KNOW THIS IS ABOUT FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT THERE COULD ALSO BE INSTANCES WHERE. THERE IS A HOME THAT IS OWNED BY. A FAMILY MEMBER THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO THEN SELL TO A NOTHER FAMILY MEMBER BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY OR SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE YOU KNOW TRANSFER WITH PURCHASES ETCETERA. AND IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THOSE TYPES OF- PURCHASES TO BE. CONSIDERED BECAUSE MAYBE A FAMILY IS REALLY INTERESTED IN KEEPING THAT HOUSE YOU KNOW. EIGHT IN THEIR NAME BUT FOLKS ARE TRYING TO NECESSARILY GIVE THE HOUSE AWAY SO- DOES THAT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE THAT UNDERSTANDS- AND WE ACTUALLY RECOMMEND DESIGNING THE PROGRAM WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY- DIED SAID TO ADDRESS SITUATIONS LIKE SUCH AS THAT I ALSO WANT TO AGAIN REALLY THANK. ESPECIALLY THE TEEMING CAL HFA FRIENDS ASKING HOW THE OTHER FOLKS OVER THERE FOR PROVIDING SOME TREMENDOUS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP US UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW THEIR EXISTING YOU KNOW DELIVERY AND COUNCIL THAT WORKS CAN BE TAPPED TO ACHIEVE THE EXACT AND SAT OUTSIDE THE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YEAH YEAH AND THE OTHER THING AND THIS WILL JUST BE MY FINAL IS THAT. YOU KNOW. I WOULD HATE FOR US TO GET INTO A SCENARIO WHERE WE SAY X. NUMBER OF HOMES YOU KNOW IN NORTHERN CAL X. NUMBER OF HOMES IN SOUTHERN CAL X. NUMBER OF HOMES IN CENTRAL VALLEY X. NUMBER OF HOMES IN SAN DIEGO BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN. A LOT OF THIS IS PREDICATED ON THE MARKET. AND YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW EQUOL. IS DIFFERENCE BASED ON JUST WHAT THINGS COST AND SO YOU IF YOU DID IT THAT WAY SO THAT EVERYONE GOT YOU KNOW THE SAME AMOUNTS RIGHT OF MONEY OF ACCESS. THEN SOME COMMUNITIES WOULD BE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BECAUSE LESS WOULD GO TO THEM JUST BECAUSE THE COST. ARE ARE ARE MUCH HIGHER AND I'M THINKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT LATE AND OF COURSE THE BAY AREA AND I KNOW THOSE TWO REGIONS GET YOU KNOW CALLED OUT QUITE A BIT BUT THEY JUST ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE. THAT'S IT FOR ME IS THAT IT FOR YOU MIKE UP YES THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL RIGHT SO THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM AND WE ARE GOING TO AND DIRECTS STAFF TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE ADMINISTRATION ON AT REDEFINING THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALSO THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE A CALIFORNIA DREAM- SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER- ELEVEN WHICH IS A DIVISION OF STATE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS.

THERE'S AN UNCOMMITTED BALANCE OF ABOUT SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION OF THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES CORPORATION THAT TO DO TO CANCEL PROJECTS AND SAVINGS WE DIDN'T ABLE TO REALIZE THE SUPPORTS BUDGET. SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE FUNDS FOR HOUSING THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE WE'RE REQUESTING. EXTENSION OF THE INCOME RANGE. IN ORDER TO A WAR THOSE FUN IN YOUR- WITH THAT RICK THIS REAPPROPRIATION ABOUT SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION WOULD BE LOST FOR HOUSING PURPOSES. AND REVERT BACK TO THE JUDGE- TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. SO WE WOULDN'T PLAN TO MAKE THESE AWARDS AS PART OF OUR TWENTY TWENTY TWO FUNDING ROUNDS UNDER THAT CONTINUES CORPORATION- AN ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION REPRESENTS THE REMAINING DISBURSEMENTS AND CURRENT. TO CURRENT IN PROGRESS PROJECTS RUNNING UP AGAINST THAT THE SCENE COMMERCE DEADLINE SO AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA REVERBERATING A TOTAL OF TWENTY TWO MILLION FROM THE TWENTY FOURTEEN PROCREATION WILL ALLOW YOU TO COMPLETE THE WORK FOR WHICH THE FUNDS WERE ORIGINALLY ENCUMBERED. EXTENDING THAT INCOME RISKY. FROM SIX THIRTY TWENTY TWO TO SIX THIRTY TWENTY FOUR WILL ALLOW FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING GRANTEES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY CURRENTLY PROGRESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THE FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT.

AT WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT. AGAIN THANK YOU YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE EACH DAY IS REQUESTING A LITTLE OVER FIFTY SIX MILLION IN THE FEDERAL TRUST FUND AND FOR POSITIONS. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AS WELL AS- EIGHT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. EIGHT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IT'S AN ONGOING RESOURCES TO MANAGE AND OVERSEE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMMUNITY BUILDING BLOCK GRANT. MITIGATION PROGRAMS SOME HELPFUL- THIS IS A PROGRAM TO FUND MITIGATION EFFORTS TO PREVENT FURTHER IMPACT FROM DISASTER WILL PREVENT FUTURE DISASTERS FROM OCCURRING. IN THAT AREA AND THIS FEDERAL FUNDING WAS ALLOCATED TO CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE RESILIENCE TO DISASTERS. AND REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE LONG TERM RISK OF LOSS OF LIFE INJURY. DAMAGE TO AND LOSS OF PROPERTY AND SUFFERING AND HARDSHIP THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WILDFIRES THIS IS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM FOR BOTH TIED IN FOR CALIFORNIA. IN THIS REQUEST WILL ALLOW. YOU TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE FUNDING THAT HAS RECENTLY BEEN RECONFIGURED. TO BETTER SYSTEMS DISASTER AFFECTED JURISDICTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FINANCE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT. THE END OF MARCH FROM THE FINANCE- NO. COME L. A- WOULD YOU LIKE TO PER ANY. MOTIONS DRIZZLE RIPPLES THANK YOU THANK YOU AND ARE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR KABIR ANY OF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES I DO HAVE QUESTIONS- SO- IS THIS PARTICULAR ITEM. BASICALLY LISTS FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THE ONLY THING THAT ARE LISTED ARE. EXPENSES RELATED TO DISTRIBUTING THE MONEY NOT. ANY DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE MONEY'S GOING TO BE USED FOR CAN SOMEBODY GIVE ME AN IDEA SPECIFICALLY ABOUT- HOW WE INTEND TO. TO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF GRANTS AND HOW DO THEY GET DISTRIBUTED- WHAT'S- WHAT'S OUR PRIORITY FOR SPENDING WHAT IS. REALLY INCREDIBLE- RESOURCES TO- BE ABLE TO MEET THE- DISASTER NEEDS IN OUR STATE AND YOU KNOW EVERY REGION IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT- SOME HAVE. THAT THE NATURAL DISASTERS ARE FIRES AND OTHERS ARE FLOODING AND OTHERS ARE- ARE POTENTIAL EARTHQUAKE SO AS WE START LOOKING AT HOW WE EXPAND THESE FINE TOWER HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT. YEAH GREAT QUESTIONS IS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM LOVABLE FOR US LIKE I SAID AND HIDE- WITH ME I DO HAVE JEFFREY ROSS WHO HEADS ARE FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DIVISION AND HE'S BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH A LOT OF OUR DISASTER AFFECTED COMMUNITIES SO HE CAN PROVIDE YOU SOME SPECIFICS. THANK MORNING- JEFF ROSS DEPUTY DIRECTOR DIVISION OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BECAUSE- WE'RE VERY EXCITED AS AS THE- SHOOTER VIDEO SAID. MENTIONED THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM FOR HIGH END FOR US. AND SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING IS WORKING WITH ARE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN DISASTER COMMUNITIES THE PRIMARY COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT COME TO FOLKS MIND- FOR THOSE TWO YEARS. ARSENAL COUNTY IN SANTA ROSA. BUTTE COUNTY IN PARADISE THAT THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPACTED BUT AS WE NOW. DISASTERS CONTINUE TO IMPACT VARIOUS COMMUNITIES. AROUND THE STATE AS A WHOLE. AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE TRYING TO DO IS WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT ARE THE GAPS IN THE CURRENT LONG TERM RECOVERY AND MITIGATION- YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT REALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. HOW DO WE LEVERAGE OTHER RESOURCES IN USE THESE BONDS. AT FOR THEIR HIGHEST AND BEST USE. IS IT'S GOING TO BE THOSE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL BE ON GOING IN THE MONTHS TO COME THE REALLY ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY THAT THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE FOR THESE DOLLARS. BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW ALLOCATION- WE DO ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT AS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FLOW FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS ACTIVITY WILL WILL ALSO NOW BECOME PART OF THE LARGER DISASTER RECOVERY RESPONSE EFFORTS. AND SO WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE THINKING OF MITIGATION ON SEVERAL LEVELS OF PLANNING. AND SUSTAINABILITY. INFRASTRUCTURE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING AND CHINESE MITIGATION ACTIVITIES VERY SPECIFICALLY. TO THOSE OTHER EFFORTS AND THEN AGAIN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- FIGURE OUT HOW THAT THE BEST WAY TO LEVERAGE. OTHER RESOURCES SO THAT WAY WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE MAXIMIZE- THESE THESE DOLLARS AS THEY CONTINUE TO FLOW TOWARD COMMUNITIES. SO IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY- THIS IS THIS IS- MITIGATION FOR PASSED- DISASTERS. NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO I GUESS- THE QUESTION I HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE. WELL ACTUALLY THE QUESTION SHOULD BE- ARE WE GONNA SEE UP A PLAN OR OR- A PROPOSAL AT SOME POINT SO WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE RESOURCES WOULD GO OUT OR ARE WE JUST SAYING. DO WHATEVER DO WHATEVER I GUESS IS THE QUESTION THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE- THOSE FIRES TOOK OUT. HUGE SYSTEMS WATER SYSTEMS ROADWAYS- SO I'M I'M WONDERING IF IT'S IF IT'S A REPLACEMENT ASSISTANCE BUT ALSO- D. THE ABILITY TO DO A PROACTIVE- I KIND OF HARDENING YES BECAUSE I MEAN THE LAST THING WE WANT IS FOR A ROOF REPEAT IN THOSE SAME AREAS AND- SO UGH ARE WE GONNA SEE SOMETHING DOWN THE ROAD ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SENATOR IT IS NOT SIMPLE REPLACEMENT REALLY IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE AS WE BUILD BACK WE ARE BUILDING BACK. WE ARE HARD MEAN WE ARE BEING MORE RESILIENT WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE- THE DANGERS THAT EXIST AND SO THAT WAY COMMUNITIES CAN FUNCTION WE DO AS A AS A PART OF THESE FINES HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT IS KNOWN AS AN ACTION PLANNING PROCESS WHERE WE ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITIES WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM TO DETERMINE AGAIN WHAT THESE THESE- BEST USES OF MEDICATIONS ARE WE HAVE TO SUBMIT THOSE PLANS BASED ON PUBLIC PARTICIPATION TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT SO THAT WAY WE CAN THEN GO ABOUT AND UTILIZED THE FUNDING ITSELF. SEVEN THE STAFF IN AND THE REQUEST THAT WAS PART OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IS EACH YEAR ARE PREPARED TO WORK HAND IN HAND WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND WITH HOW IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GO THROUGH THAT THAT VERY MINDFUL PLANNING PROCESS AND WE CAN VERY CLEARLY SAY WHAT THOSE USED AS A FUNDS WILL BE AND WE ABSOLUTELY CAN REPORT THAT BACK ON BECAUSE IT IS PART OF OUR ON GOING TO FOURTEEN AND TEN EFFORTS THAT WE DO BOTH ON HERE WITH THE STATE AND WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY- WE'RE GOOD I. I'M NOT. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD SUPPLANT WHAT LOCALS WANT DONE IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT- TO THE EXTENT THAT- THAT. THE RESOURCES ARE COMING THROUGH THE STATE I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SEE THE REPORT IT'S GOING TO GO TO HEAD- IF ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH FEDERAL FUNDS AND- WHAT KIND OF. OF A- IMPROVEMENTS WERE GOING TO MAKE IN THESE IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND BEEN SO DEVASTATED SO I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE. THANK YOU SENATOR CAREER OFFICER ON DO YOU OKAY SO THIS IS APPROVED AS BUDGETED THIS ITEM AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR FINAL ITEM I'M- WITH PART B. THE ISSUE TWELVE THE HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN- ARE YOU IN YOUR BACK AGAIN- BACK- SO ANOTHER ANOTHER FEDERAL PROGRAM ANOTHER NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS- SO EACH IS REQUESTING- NEARLY HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION- FROM THE FEDERAL TRUST FUND FIFTEEN POSITIONS AND THE A TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET YEAR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND I'M GOING TO PLAN DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER THE NEW FEDERALLY FUNDED. PROGRAM CALLED THE HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN PROGRAM ANOTHER MOUTHFUL- WE ALSO REQUEST ACTUALLY LANGUAGE YOU AUTHORIZE HE SHOULD BE TO LET THE GUIDELINE PROCESS FOR THE WHOLE PROGRAM AND FOR THE EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REASON IS THIS IS A NEW FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT BROADLY SPEAKING COMBINED SEVERAL ELIGIBLE USES OF FUNDS INCLUDING YOUR FORMAL HOUSING-PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND MANY OF THESE USERS CAPS LATE WHAT IS ALLOWABLE IN THE CURRENT NUMBERS TO SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM ALSO ADMINISTERED BY HCD. A SUPPORT IN THE NOTE I THINK AS THE AGENDA DOES- THAT THIS NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS ALSO AN AFFIRMATION OF CALIFORNIA'S HOKEY PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA'S BEEN FEATURED IN HOUSE ROLL OUT OF THIS PROGRAM GIVEN THE L. AS POLICE IN THAT SPACE- THE GUIDELINE PROCESS THE COMPANY'S REQUEST IS QUITE IMPORTANT FOR US IN ORDER TO FOR THE STATE TO QUICKLY DEPLOY THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. OUR CURRENTLY ENGAGES YOU'VE HEARD AND STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH TO ALLOW FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AS REQUIRED BY HUD THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT PROCESS GREATLY LIMITS THE FLEXIBILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS RESPOND TO THAT FEDERAL GUIDANCE IN CHANGES- THEY CAN THEY HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON NOT ONLY OUR PERFORMANCE BUT IT COULD CREATE ADDITIONAL RISK FREE CAPTURE LOSS OF FEDERAL FUNDS. TO SEND HOME A R. P. IS A HYBRID OF BOTH THAT FEDERAL HOOK UP WITH THE CURRENT FEDERAL HOME PROGRAM IN THE CURRENT FEDERAL EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAMS AND THE WORK IS BEING DONE FOR THIS PROGRAM IS IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THAT CURRENT ESG HOME PROGRAMS WITH THOSE CONTINUES OF CARE AT THE LOCAL LEVELS THAT MR THEM- WE ASK FOR THAT KIND THAT THAT SORT OF FLEXIBILITY IN ORDER FOR US TO. MAXIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY OF. THANK YOU FINANCING TO LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY A LA- WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY AND COMMON. NO ISSUES TO RAISE WITH THE SCRIPT THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE GOING TO IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE- FOR DISCUSS QUESTION SENATOR COPYRIGHT YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I DO AND I. FROM I RECEIVED- PHONE CALLS FROM SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAD RECEIVED. ALL THESE NAMES- HOME KEY EITHER HOME CARE ROOM KEY- IT KEEPS ONE OF THE KEY YEAH- THAT GRANTS AND- THE THEY WERE THAT THE GRANTS WERE FEDERALLY PART OF THE FEDERAL. MONEY THAT THE STATE DISTRIBUTED FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM- IN ORDER TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS AND- IT WAS A PURCHASE OF A- MOTEL TO CONVERTED TO RESIDENTIAL USE AND THE STATE HAD ALLOWED A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BALKED AT THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDSTO DO THIS PROGRAM- WITHOUT GOING TO A SECRET ANALYSIS WHICH WOULD HAVE. TAKEN A LOT OF TIME AND BASICALLY WOULD HAVE- WRIST A RETURN OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS BECAUSE- WE WERE COMPLYING WITH THEIR THE RULES AND REGULATIONS IS THAT ANTICIPATED IN IN THIS BUDGET- ALLOCATION AND IS THAT WHAT IS- REFERENCED WHEN YOU YOU- IT MENTIONS THAT- THAT SOME THAT THAT THERE'S A WAIVER OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT AS WELL AS MAKING OTHER MINOR ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES. IS THAT ONE OF THE MINOR ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS HAVE YOU. WE BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO EACH CD BECAUSE- IT'S VERY SERIOUS- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE RESPONSE WE GOT BACK WHICH WAS SATISFACTORY. YEAH WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUE I BELIEVE IT'S A PROJECT IN SALINAS OBERNOLTE HI- THAT ACTUALLY WASN'T AT HOME KEEP USUALLY WORKS BECAUSE THEY WERE COMBINING THE USE OF FEDERAL VOUCHERS WHICH ARE MISTER BY HOUSING AUTHORITY SO WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THOSE PIECES- WE WERE WE ARE ABLE TO STREAMLINE THE STATE CONTROLLED PIECES SO WHAT. WELL IT WAS NOT- IT WOULD LEAD TO A DELAY THERE IS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH NEPA ESSENTIALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S VERSION OF SEQUEL WE CAN'T OF COURSE- CONTROL OR A FACTUALLY CHANGE THERE WE ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH OUR- PARTNERS ON A NUMBER OF AREAS- YOU CD AFFIRMATION IN THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM- DIFFERENT SORTS OF FEDERAL FUNDS. THEY LOVE THE HOKEY PROGRAM SO WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY REYES TO THEM SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH SOME OF THOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS WHAT WE ASK FOR IN TERMS OF- ON THE AT LEAST THE SIDE THAT WE CONTROL OUR OWN STATE- REGULATORY PROCESS. IS GUIDELINES CREATE A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO SOMETIMES THE FEDERAL RULES CHANGE IF THEN WE WERE IN TURN YOU HAVE TO GO BACK THROUGH A NOTHER REGULATORY PROCESS ON OUR END WE WOULDN'T BE WE WOULDN'T BE VERY NIMBLE IN ORDER TO ADAPT TO THAT CHANGE SO. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS OF ENDEMIC WHEN OUR DEPARTMENT RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF FUNDS- PULL THROUGH THE ESG INCOMPATIBLE APOC GRANT PROGRAMS HAD WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THOSE OUT TO COMMUNITIES. F. MANNER BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO UNDERGO CHANGES- GOVERNANCE INSIGHTS EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO ALLOW US TO BYPASS THIS PROCESS EASIER BUT NOW THAT WE'VE GOTTEN SOME MOMENTUM WITH THE FACTS- IN THE CREATION OF THIS PROGRAM THAT ESSENTIALLY COMBINED SOME OF THOSE USES WE DON'T WANT TO- TAKE OUR FOOT OFF THE GAS. PEDAL SO TO SPEAK SO THAT'S WHY THAT WE SEE THAT REQUEST IT WILL FIX. OUR NEED TO ESSENTIALLY COMPLY WITH FEDERAL RULES REGULATIONS WERE OF COURSE IN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH TIED TO INFORM THEM OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY CAN HAVE THAT SOME OF THOSE- SOME OF SOME OF THE EXERTIONS CARE AT FORTY ON I NEED. BUT GO THROUGH- BUT COURSE WE DON'T. WE HAVE TO GET TO THAT PROCESS WITH THEM. WE DON'T HAVE THE- AT STATE. TO CHANGE THE RULES BUT THIS WELL AS- THAT PROCESS. MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT BERRIER. LIKE THE ONE YOU KNOW TO. AT LEAST MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE IS NOT PUTTING ANY VERY AND PLACE. AN ORDER FOR THE SPEAK FINISHED PRODUCTS- VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT I DO APPRECIATE IT- MY CONCERN IS IF YOU NEED IF YOU. IF IN ORDER FOR PROJECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU NEED VARIOUS SOURCES OF REVENUE IN ORDER TO- PAY DOWN THE COST OF THE PROJECT. AND THERE'S ONE PART OF THE- THE- THE SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES DNIEPER SEQUIN ONE WE'VE WAITED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND INTO HOUSING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THAT THAT REALLY IS GOING TO COME UP THE WORKS IN THE MORE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS HAVE THEM UNDERSTAND THAT- WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT TOGETHER AND- WE WANT TO USE THAT FUNDS AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE SO APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR- YOUR INFORMATION. WE SHARE YOUR SENTIMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU I AM. JUST I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF WHAT I DID- NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND ACCESS TO NEW A FEDERAL DOLLARS EXCITING. I ALWAYS WANT TO- JUST FOR THE RECORD SHARE THAT. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE MINIMIZE THE COSTS. OF REPACKAGING FEDERAL PROGRAM SO THAT WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING AS MUCH OF THOSE DOLLARS- TO THE COMMUNITIES AS POSSIBLE AND OFTEN TIMES. YOU KNOW IF IT'S FEDERAL AND STATE AND THEN REGIONAL EVERYONE'S LIKE TAKING A PIECE AND THEN THAT LESSENS. THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE AT THE END TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK SO. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY IN THE ANALYSIS BUT I WANTED TO RAISE THAT- IN CASE YOU HAVE A SENSE OF. THE COSTS THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. OR JUST MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE MINIMIZED. A JOB THAT YOU CAN GET CERTAINLY ELABORATE I MEAN OUR ASSESSMENT IS IT WILL TAKE US ABOUT FIFTEEN POSITIONS THE CURRENT YEAR- AND- AS A FEW AND ON GOING- MAYBE ADD A LITTLE BIT OF. AT OF EVIDENCE HERE. FOR THE MOST PART HCD WILL RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS WERE HELPING TO SMALLER AND MOST RURAL AND SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES THE SMALLER POPULATION COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T RECEIVE DIRECT ALLOCATIONS FOR CLASS SO. THEIR CAPACITY IS LESS SO WE FIND THAT WE DO HAVE TO PROVIDE QUITE A BIT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH WE'RE HAPPY TO DO- SOMETIMES AND EVEN PROCURE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS TO GOTTEN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO YEAH I THINK THIS IS THIS IS FAIRLY IT'S FAIRLY LEAN BUT IT ALSO WASN'T ENOUGH FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR SYSTEM AND- IT'S A BIT SO THAT WE CAN HELP THOSE THOSE CAN USE THAT TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH- AS MUCH LOCAL STAFFING TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE MANY FEDERAL REGULATIONS OF THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. OKAY THANKS YEAH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND MARKETING ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT JUST WHINING I DEFINITELY AGREE- TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HELPING FOLKS NAVIGATE. THROUGH THE DATE WITH THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THIS IS SO I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO ASK- AND I KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES HOUSING AUTHORITIES ARE ARE ARE SORT OF TAX BASED BUT- IS IT POSSIBLE. THAT SOME OF THESE FUNDS COULD BE CONNECTED TO REGIONAL HOUSING AUTHORITIES THAT ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THESE FOUR ARE DOING SOME OF THESE- FIVE ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE LISTED. YOU KNOW PRODUCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPORTING WITH TENANT BASED ASSISTANCE OFFERING SUPPORTIVE- AND HOUSING HOMELESS PREVENTION SERVICES- XCERRA. YEAH ALL THE DIVERSE OUT OF THE JUST THE YOU IF YOU DID. IF YOU WANT TO WEAR WE ARE AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY SPECIALLY WHEN TAKE THE EXAMPLE HOME HE WHICH IS CERTAINLY AN ELIGIBLE USE HERE OR IN MANY NEW PRODUCTION. KIND OF- FOR PROGRAMS OFTEN HOUSING AUTHORITIES ARE EITHER CO APPLICANTS TO THOSE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDERS OF RESOURCES MOST PROGRAMS ABOUT YOURS OR OTHER MEANS. AND STILL DEPENDS UPON THE STATE ON THE FERRY THE STATE BUT THERE ARE SOME HOUSING AUTHORITIES THERE QUITE INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS- AND ARE OFTEN RECIPIENTS OF THESE FUNDS AND PARTNERS WITH THEIR OWN FUNDING SO YES. THAT IS TRUE EVEN IF THEY ARE DIRECT RECIPIENTS THERE OFTEN ENTITIES. THAT ARE HELPING THE POLICE. I WOULD JUST NAY THAT ARE ALSO FINDING OUR TRUE. HOUSE AT THE SO IT IS BOTH THE CITIES THE COUNTIES AND THE TRIBAL HOUSING AUTHORITIES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ENGAGE WITH UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO REALLY MAKE SURE. THAT WE BRING EVERY RESOURCE. TO TRY AND HELP SO MUCH FOR. OKAY GREAT- SO THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM. AND WITH THAT I THINK THIS CONCLUDES THE DISCUSSION ITEMS FOR PARK A AS WELL AS THE DISCUSSION ITEMS FOR PART B. I'M- OKAY I'LL WAIT TO DO QUORUM. WILL GO INTO- NO YOU'RE STAYING OKAY DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO DO QUORUM NOW YES WHY DON'T WE- MISTER CONSULTANT COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SO WE COULD ESTABLISH A QUORUM. THAT'S OKAY. CABALLERO HERE CABALLERO HERE NIELSEN ROTH YOUR- THAT'S THREE- WE- SO WE HAVE A QUORUM SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY MOVE ON ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING ITEMS ON THE AGENDA- BOTH PART A AND PART B. AS A REMINDER TODAY'S PARTICIPANT NUMBER IS. IS ONE FOUR ONE ONE ONE FOUR ZERO. DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAY INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY TODAY I'M GOING TO ASK THAT EACH MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC PROVIDING COMMENTS KEEP THEIR REMARKS WITHIN ONE MINUTE NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH WITNESSES HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM.

FOR WILL HOUSING PARTNERS WE'RE HERE TO GIVE YOU SOME LOVE SOME TANKS AND SOME SUPPORT FOR THE SENATE'S PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS TO BOTH THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM. THEY CALIFORNIA HOUSING ACCELERATOR AND HOME KEY- THE CALIFORNIA ACCELERATOR IS ACTUALLY REALLY CRITICAL PIECE WITH THE STATE AS MAXIMIZE IT USED TO FEDERAL TAX EXEMPT BONDS AND 4% LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS.

MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF MR STIVERS AND PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO SEE THE INVESTMENTS AND CAL HOME AND THE JOE CERNER. FOR HOUSING GRANT PROGRAMS BUT I WANT TO- GOING BACK ISSUE EIGHT FOCUS ON A DIFFERENT ISSUE WHICH IS. A FUNDING FOR- PRESERVATION MOBILE HOME PARK FOR PROPOSING THE GOVERNOR IS TO PUT A HUNDRED. MILLION WHICH WE SUPPORT. INTO THE EXISTING IMPROPER PROGRAM. THAT'S GREAT WHAT WERE A BIT CONCERNED WITH. A COMPANY IN TBL. WHICH WOULD RENAME THE PROGRAM THE MORE PROGRAM AND HAS A NUMBER OF CHANGES. TRADITIONALLY THIS FUNDING HAS BEEN THERE TO PRESERVE MOBILE HOME PARKS EITHER THROUGH RESIDENT OWNERSHIP OR THROUGH. A CONVERSION OR OR TRANSFER TO A NONPROFIT MISSION DRIVEN DEVELOPER WHO WILL KEEP THE AFFORDABLE THIS PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN THE TV I WOULD PROPOSE TO ALLOW THAT FUNDING TO GO TO A PRIVATE. FOR PROFIT OWNER. TO FIX UP THEIR PARKS AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WHILE THAT MAY SOMETIMES BE USEFUL. THEY'RE NOT A SUFFICIENT PARAMETERS IN THERE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE AFFORDABILITY OF PROTECTIONS FROM DISPLACEMENT. WE'RE ALSO LOSING SOME OF THE- FAVORABLE LOAN TERMS- THAT ARE SPELLED OUT IN THE STATUTE IN FAVOR OF. ADOPTING AND GUIDELINES WHO HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND BRIEFLY WITH YOUR STAFF ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS AND OTHERS. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM CONTINUES. ITS PRIMARY FUNCTION BECAUSE IT IS THE CURRENT. BALANCE THIS COMES FROM. FEES PAID BY HOMEOWNERS. THAT THE FUND IS GOING PRIMARILY TO PRESERVING PARKS AND THE LONG TERM STABILITY FOR HOMEOWNERS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND IT'S GOOD MORNING AND GOOD AFTERNOON WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE TIME. STILL MORNING NO MORNING HI MADAM CHAIR HOLLY FOR MANY DAYS IS FROM MY HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS TODAY.

COMMITTEES IN GENERAL FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THESE PURPOSES.
