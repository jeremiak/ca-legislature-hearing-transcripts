THAT THOSE WILL PLACE THE A

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.584
SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN PREDATION IN

IN TAMPING DOWN THE POPULATION

00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:49.754

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:39.016
SO EVER.

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:41.552
WITHIN MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS.

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:43.187
THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS.

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:46.457
IN WHICH THE WATER IS HAZARDOUS.

00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:49.927
AN UNSAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:51.362
WITHIN MY DISTRICT THERE ARE

EACH DAY.

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.982
FAMILIES HAD TO DRIVE DOWN TO

THE WATER SUPPLY WAS GONE THEY

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:24.662

IN IRAQ DURING THE WAR.

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.342
OUR PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:40.945
THIRD WORLD WATER CONDITIONS IN

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:43.180
OUR STATE.

OUR STATE WHICH BOASTS BEING THE

FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY.

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.853
IN THE WORLD.

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:50.588
SADLY.

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:52.823
I KNOW THAT THIS DISASTER IS NOT

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.126
UNIQUE TO MY DISTRICT ALONE

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:55.426

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:12.409
AND FOR RECOGNIZING THE MERIT IN

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:14.712

MEMBERS.

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:20.985
YOUR CONSTITUENTS NEED THIS

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:23.087
MEASURE.

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:25.256
IN RECENT YEARS.

00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:27.024
WE'VE SEEN A STAGGERING NUMBER

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.093
OF WATER BONDS.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.429
ON OUR BALLOT.

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:35.166
THESE EFFORTS HAVE ADDED

00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:38.202
[inaudible] TO OUR EIGHTY FOUR

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:40.004
BILLION DOLLAR OUTSTANDING

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:44.642
GENERAL FUND SUPPORTED BOND DEBT.

00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.110
THERE HAVE BEEN EIGHT BONDS

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:48.479
APPROVED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:51.115
AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:52.783
NOVEMBER.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.851
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HOWEVER.

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:57.221
VOTERS REJECTED PROPOSITION.

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:59.423
THREE AN EIGHT POINT.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.025
NINE BILLION DOLLAR WATER BOND.

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:03.394
SIGNALING A FUNDAMENTAL DESIRE

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.030
BY THE VOTERS TO SHIFT AWAY FROM

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:07.932
BOX.

00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:11.268
ACCORDING TO THE PP I SEE.

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:13.003
SINCE TWO THOUSAND STATE BONTA

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.072
HELPS.

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:16.640
PHIL FUNDING GAPS.

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:19.944
WHAT BONDS ARE NOT A RELIABLE

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.378
LONG TERM SOURCE?

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:24.215
AND THEY GENERALLY DON'T COVER

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:27.785
OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS.

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:29.887
LOOKING BEYOND BONDS TO FILL

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:33.257
GAPS SHOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY.

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:36.160
WE CANNOT KEEP MOVING FORWARD.

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:39.630
WITH PEACE NO WATER FUNDING.

00:41:39.697 --> 00:41:42.099
IT IS SIMPLY TOO IMPORTANT. TO

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:45.035
NOT LOOK AT WATER FUNDING ON THE

00:41:45.102 --> 00:41:47.071
LARGE SCALE.

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:48.939
WE MUST SHIFT.

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:50.574
TOWARDS A MORE APPROPRIATE AND

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:51.709
PERMANENT.

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:55.679
PAY AS YOU GO FUNDING SYSTEM.

00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:57.514
ACCORDING TO THE LA ILL.

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:59.450
WE FIND THAT BOND FUNDING WOULD

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:01.385
NOT BE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE BONDS

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.487
PROVIDE A ONE TIME FUNDING

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:05.122
SOURCE.

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:07.591
AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:10.194
AN ONGOING FUND SOURCE.

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:11.929
MOREOVER GENERAL OBLIGATION

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:13.597

GENERAL FUND.

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:16.700
WITH INTEREST AND THEREFORE

00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:19.270
WOULD BECAUSE THIS APPROACH TO

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:21.972
BE SOMEWHAT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.441
DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE

00:42:24.508 --> 00:42:24.675

00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:37.421
AS SUCH.

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.290
NOT ONLY WITH THE SHIFT SAVE ON

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.958
INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM GENERAL

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:43.327

OUTSTANDING DEBTS.

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:50.267
THIS IS WHY ADONAI ALONG WITH

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:52.569
MANY COLLEAGUES HAVE AUTHORED A

00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:37.007
NIGHT AND I GUESS I GUESS FOR ME

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.642

DO -- AND I I TO HOLY UNDERSTAND

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:44.181
I'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF A PRETTY

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:45.082
MUCH EVERY WATER.

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:46.216
WATER BILL THAT'S COME FORWARD I

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:47.517
UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND WHERE

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:49.086
YOU'RE COMING FROM.

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:50.153
HOWEVER I LOOK AT MY OWN

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.221
DISTRICT -- WE ARE WATER DONORS

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:52.255
TO THE STATE.

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:52.989
YOU NOW TAKE 2% AWAY FROM THE

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:54.391
GENERAL FUND THAT'S 2% THAT WE

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:55.892
GET WE DON'T GET FOR OTHER

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:56.827
THINGS IN ART ALREADY POOR

00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:58.362
DISTRICT.

00:49:58.428 --> 00:50:00.097
LIKE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:02.299
LIKE HEALTH CARE NEEDS.

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.400
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY ON AN

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:06.303
ONGOING BASIS -- AND WE ARE

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:09.139
ASKING TO TIE THE HANDS OF

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:10.607
FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S.

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:15.979
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHICH I

00:50:16.046 --> 00:50:17.447
ABSOLUTELY A HUGE SUPPORTER OF

00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:20.684
EDUCATION -- THAT CREATES

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.185
CHALLENGES FOR US AT TIMES AS

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:24.187
WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE ADDITIONAL

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:26.990
REVENUE -- SO -- I ABSOLUTES

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.658
WHAT WERE YOU DOING BUT FOR

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:30.327
THOSE OF US IN AREAS WHERE WHERE

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:31.895
WATER IS NOT AN ISSUE WE ARE

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:34.297
SURE OUR WATER DONORS -- AND AND

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.999
AT TIMES WE HAVE WATER CRISIS OF

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:38.435
OUR OWN -- YOU'RE TAKING AWAY

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:41.104
MONEY FOR OTHER THINGS THAT THAT

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:43.940
MY FOLKS -- REALLY STRUGGLE WITH

00:50:44.007 --> 00:50:45.909
WE CAN'T GET RESOURCES AROUND

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:49.312
FROM THE ENVIRO SCAN FOR FROM

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:52.048
FROM CARB -- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:54.384
CONSIDERED BECAUSE WE BECAUSE WE

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:55.385
HAVE CLEAN WATER.

00:50:55.452 --> 00:50:56.286
SO WE CAN'T GET SOME OF THE

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:57.621
RESOURCES YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO

00:50:57.687 --> 00:50:59.523
GET IN OTHER PARTS OF YOUR

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:00.190
DISTRICT.

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:02.592
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND I KNOW IT

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:03.860
THE WRITING -- WHEN YOU KNOW

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:04.461

DONE WITH FISH TRIBUTARIES AND

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.569
THINGS LIKE THAT THE FUNDING

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:13.703
FROM THIS WOULD ACTUALLY HELP

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.572

WHO WHO WHAT SO SO THE WAY THAT

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:33.924

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:15.365
40% IS THAT GOING TO HELP WITH

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:16.700
FIRE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS ARE

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:18.368
FIRE PROTECTION EFFORTS IN IN MY

00:52:18.435 --> 00:52:19.636
DISTRICT [inaudible]

00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:21.705
CELL.

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:23.406
YOU KNOW I I ACTUALLY RAN A BILL

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:24.674
TO TAKE -- G. G. R. F. FUNDS

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:25.876
AWAY FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL WHICH

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:26.710
DOESN'T HELP YOUR DISTRICT

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:28.645
EITHER AND HAVE A GO TO CAL FIRE

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:30.514
TO HELP OUT WITH THE FIRES -- WE

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.648
HAVE SEVERAL FIRES AND MY

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.183
DISTRICT AS WELL.

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:35.886
AND I THINK THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:37.754
BEING DONE IN THAT AREA --

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:39.923
HOWEVER THERE'S NOT BEEN IN.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.725
ENOUGH DONE AND WATER AGREED AND

00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:43.894
2%.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.729
VERSE IS BOND AFTER BON AFTER

00:52:45.795 --> 00:52:47.397
BOND.

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:50.133
I THINK IS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.201
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE MADE A

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.936
PROMISE TO OUR CITIZENS THAT WE

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.204
WOULD TAKE CARE OF THEM WHEN IT

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:55.839
COMES TO WATER.

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:57.240
IN A INDUSTRY INDUSTRY SETS US

00:52:57.307 --> 00:52:59.943
UP IN IN AN AVENUE WHERE.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.111
EVERY DISTRICT ACROSS THE STATE

00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:02.546
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE WATER

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:03.980
NEEDS ARE WHETHER IT BE

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:05.448
ENVIRONMENTAL.

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:08.785
WHETHER IT BE A BAD FIVE SLACK

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:09.886
WHAT LA IS DEALING WITH.

00:53:09.953 --> 00:53:13.356
THIS PROVIDES ONGOING REVENUE.

00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:15.125
TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE

00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:16.726
FUNDING NECESSARY TO DO WHAT IS

00:53:16.793 --> 00:53:19.095
NECESSARY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR

00:53:19.162 --> 00:53:20.530
WATER NEEDS.

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:23.033
SO AND I UNDERSTAND IT IN IN THE

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:23.867
NORTH DISTRICT YOU MIGHT FEEL

00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:25.268
THE DAUGHTERS BUT YOU DO HAVE

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:26.603
INFRASTRUCTURE UP THERE.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.638
THE NEEDS TO TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:30.774
MAINTENANCE IS GOING ON AS I

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.309
MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:33.243
WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER ORVILLE

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.179
SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE DEFERRED

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:37.647
MAINTENANCE GO TO THAT POINT.

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:39.316
SO IT HATE TO SEE ANY LEVEES OR

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:41.017

00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:27.717
ANNUAL BASIS YOU KNOW WE KNOW.

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:28.952
THAT OUR REVENUE MADE OF

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:30.320
FLUCTUATE.

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:33.022
AND WE WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.657
TO MAKE THE DECISION.

00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:36.626
LISTING INFORMATION AND

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:39.562
OVERSIGHT OVER TO FUND SHOW ARE

00:56:39.629 --> 00:56:41.097
OF ALLOCATED.

00:56:41.164 --> 00:56:47.070
SO OUR WORK -- I RESPECTFULLY --

AND STAY OFF ON ON THE ON YOUR

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:53.777

THEY MEASURE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SO --

00:56:57.547 --> 00:56:57.981
I'M INTRIGUED BY THIS.

00:56:58.047 --> 00:56:59.249
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S LOTS OF ISSUES

00:56:59.315 --> 00:57:00.683
IN THE STATE TO TO NEED

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.152

ALSO.

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:05.688
SOMEONE WHO IS FOR MANY MANY

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:07.190
YEARS DONE BUDGETS THAT ARE

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.725
ALREADY COMPLETELY ALLOCATED OUT

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:12.162

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:13.663
FOR GENERAL PURPOSE THANKS.

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:15.031
WHEN THERE IS NO GENERAL FUND

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:16.432
BECAUSE YOU'VE ALLOCATED IT THEN

00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:17.700
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO A

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.335
BUDGET?

00:57:19.402 --> 00:57:22.305

YOU PICK THE NUMBER 2% WHICH I

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:30.513
THINK IN EUROPE IN THE ANALYSIS

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.115
I HAVE HERE WOULD BE LIKE TWO

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:33.683

BEEN REGULATED BY THE I. R. M.

00:57:42.358 --> 00:57:43.059
W. PEAS WHICH IS THAT YOUR

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:45.795
RELATED LANDS WHICH WE PAY WE

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:47.197
ARE TAXED?

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:49.899
A RECESSED A FEE SAME THING IS

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:51.601
MONEY OUT OF OUR POCKET TO DO

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:55.238
WATERSHED -- ANALYSIS BASICALLY

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:55.839
FOR THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

SO THAT'S A TAX ON MY MY LAND

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:04.047
COULD BECAUSE I'M FARMING NOW WE

00:58:04.113 --> 00:58:05.582
HAVE THE GROUND WATER.

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:08.051
THE SIGMA THE STATE GROUND WATER

AND WE'RE WE'RE REGULATE

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.608
OURSELVES.

00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:33.509
AND ON I WANTED ALSO TO ASK

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:34.677
ABOUT.

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:36.546
YOUR NORMAL CRISIS WAS.

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.248
DUE TO A LACK OF MAINTENANCE WE

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:39.015
KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM THERE

00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:40.483
AND THE AND THE PEOPLE WHO

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:41.851
RECEIVE THE WATER ON THE OTHER

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:44.387
END SHOULD HAVE BEEN -- IN THE

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:44.988
BUREAU SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:46.623
THEIR JOB AND AND FIXING THEM

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:48.191
THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE

00:58:48.258 --> 00:58:50.393
IDENTIFIED EARLIER IN THE IN --

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.629
THE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE BUT THEY

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:54.464
BUT THEY DO A DAY DATE NEGLECTED

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:55.265
TO DO THAT.

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.467
AND THE COST OF BEARING THAT

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:58.835
SHOULD BE ON THEM.

00:58:58.902 --> 00:59:00.970
BECAUSE THEY DID MATE IT'S THERE.

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:02.572
IF A STRUCTURE THAT WAS THERE

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:04.741
BEFORE SO -- I'M INCLINED TO

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:05.675
SUPPORT YOUR BILL BUT THERE'S A

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:08.878
LOT LACK OF A LOT OF DETAILS --

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:10.413
THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND SO

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.682
ARE YOU GONNA SAY THOSE PEOPLE

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:14.150
WHO ARE IN GROUNDWATER BASINS

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:15.785
SUCH AS YOURSELF THAT ARE

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:17.086
IMPAIRED.

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:17.887
ARE THEY GONNA HAVE TO BEAR THAT

00:59:17.954 --> 00:59:18.955
COST -- THIS CALL IS THIS GOING

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:20.556
TO PAY FOR THAT AND WHAT WHAT IS

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:22.091
IT REALLY GONNA PAY FOR THERE'S

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:23.726
A LOT OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT --

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:25.395
FOLKS ARE BEING TAXED ON AND

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:27.096
FEED -- ARE THOSE GOING TO GO

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.531

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:30.667
HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY -- EVERY

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:35.104
YEAR -- TO YOU KNOW CONTINUOUSLY

00:59:35.171 --> 00:59:35.672
BE APPROPRIATED OUT OF THE

WHAT CAN I GET AN ANSWER?

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:48.017
ARE YOU OR ARE YOU GOING.

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:48.918
TO ADMIT MR DOLL I GUESS I'LL

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:50.320
LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU.

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:51.321
NUMBER.

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:52.655
ONE OR THE OTHER IS THIS MONEY

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:53.723
GOING TO BE DIRECTED IN EAR

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:55.258
MARKED IN THE DIRECTION THAT

00:59:55.325 --> 00:59:56.893
GOES TO THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE IN

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.261
IMPAIRED GROUNDWATER.

00:59:58.328 --> 00:59:59.495
RECHARGE SITUATION ARE ARE YOU

00:59:59.562 --> 01:00:00.863
CAN OFFSET THAT COST ARE YOU

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.398
GONNA CONTINUE TO TAX THEM TO

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:03.366
MAKE THEM PAY FOR THEIR PROBLEMS

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.034
AND AND THEN TAKE THIS MONEY AND

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:06.803
GO I HAVE WELL INTENTIONED AND

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.838
TO TAX ANYBODY AND AND FORCE

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.073
THEM TO PAY MORE.

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:11.341
THE THE POINT OF TAKING OUT OF

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:13.309
THE GENERAL FUND IS THIS IS TAX

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:14.877
DOLLARS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE.

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.779
THIS IS MONEY THAT OUR

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:18.548
CONSTITUENTS ARE ALREADY PAYING --

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.149
IN REGARDS TO SIGNAL -- THERE

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:21.985
SEVERAL PROJECTS COMING UP --

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.886
WE'RE GROUND WATER RECHARGE IS

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.089
GONNA BE VITAL WE HAVE --

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:27.256
MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:30.793
DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE --

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.763
DUE TO THE LACK OF GROUNDWATER

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.164
RECHARGE.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:40.336
AND THE RESULTS ON DEALING WITH --

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:45.208
THE SINKING OF LANDS.

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:46.209
ON AROUND THAT.

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:46.776
WE HAVE TO HAVE FUNDING FOR

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:47.577
THESE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:48.578
NEED TO PUT IN PLACE TO MEET

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:50.113
SIGMAR REQUIREMENTS.

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.814
THAT'S ALL PART OF IT THAT'S WHY

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.583
THIS IS DESIGNED TO COVER ANY

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:54.917
AND ALL WATER PROJECTS.

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:57.086
SO WHETHER WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:58.688
SICK MORE PROJECTS WERE DEALING

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:00.923
WITH REDOING CITY INFRASTRUCTURE

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.359
WERE DEALING WITH -- MAINTENANCE

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:07.730
ON EXISTING -- CANALES DAMS

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:10.133
LEVEES EXCEPT RAW THIS IS

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:12.435
FUNDING TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:13.836
COVER THOSE COSTS.

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:15.738
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP COMING

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.240
UP WITH NEW WAYS.

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:19.642
ON FOR OUR WATER DISTRICTS YOUR

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:21.511
CHARTER PEOPLE TO DO THIS ON US

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:22.512
FOR WE HAVE SEVERAL WATER

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:23.980
DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:25.715
PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:28.251
ENSURES THAT.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:31.354
WE HAVE A ONE WAY TO PULL

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:33.289
FUNDING FROM.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.725
AND AGAIN A. AS THE L. AO.

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:37.193
STATED.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:41.397
BY INTO REITERATE THEIR QUOTE --

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:43.399
YOU KNOW THEY SAY MOREOVER --

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:46.436
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS -- A

01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:47.703
REPAID FROM THE GENERAL FUND

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.206
WITH INTEREST THEREFORE.

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:51.741
WOULD CAUSE THIS APPROACH TO BE

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.409
SOMEWHAT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:55.445
DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:56.846
GENERAL FUND.

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:59.482
SO EVEN AT THE LA ALL THINGS

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.917
DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS.

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:04.720
THUS MARKING 2%.

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.589
WOULD BE A BETTER WAY TO GO THAN

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.224
WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.126
DECADE WHICH IS BOND AFTER BOND

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:12.028
AFTER BOUGHT HI WHAT WHAT'S IN

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.596
AGREE.

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:14.397
SO WE'RE TRYING TO ELECTION IS

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:15.398
IS.

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:18.668
MIKE I I TOTALLY GET THAT I KNOW

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:19.302

YES [inaudible]

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.604
OKAY.

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:22.805
IT'S OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.640
COMPLICATED AND AND I'D LOVE THE

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:26.909
DIVE INTO ANY DETAILS TO WORK

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:29.712
WITH YOU MOAN [inaudible]

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:30.713
FOR MR LIVING.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:35.418
MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU -- YES

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:36.586
THIS IS THE WATER IS A LITTLE

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.287
BIT OF A COMPLICATED ISSUE --

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.890
AND WE THIS IS A YEAR FOLLOWING

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.258
A LOT OF YEARS WE'VE DUG

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.760
OURSELVES OUT OF A HOLE WHERE WE

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:47.096
DO HAVE AN AMAZING SURPLUS AND I

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.598
I WOULD BE COMPLETELY FINE IF WE

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.166
TOOK OUR CLEAN WATER CHALLENGES

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.534
AND DEALT WITH IT THIS YEAR.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.703
AND I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:55.037
AND THE GOVERNOR SHOULD COME UP

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:58.107
WITH A PLAN. TO TAKE THIS STAIN --

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.309
FROM OUR STATE AND WIPE IT CLEAN

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:01.177
AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.678
CALIFORNIAN HAS CLEAN DRINKING

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:04.680
WATER THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE CAN'T

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.849
DO IT THIS YEAR -- I DO HAVE

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:10.386
PROBLEMS WITH YOUR ACA -- THOUGH

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:13.089
I I I UNDERSTAND IT COMES FROM A

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:14.090
VERY GOOD PLACE.

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:15.491
YOU'RE QUITE FRANKLY.

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.226
THE THE DEDICATION OF A PERCENT

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.794
OF THIS BUDGET IS NOT JUST

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:19.962
LIMITING WHAT WE DO WITH THE

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.997
GENERAL FUND.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:23.766
IT IS DIRECTING US TO CUT CHILD

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.536
CARE EDUCATION HEALTH CARE STATE

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:28.871
PARKS SOCIAL SERVICES THE LIST

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:31.874
GOES ON AS SOON AS THE BUDGET

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.743
GOES DOWN AND TAKES A DEBT -- IN

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:35.111
THE NEXT RECESSION.

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:36.913
IT IS GOING TO OCCUR SO YOU

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.881
WOULD BE NOT JUST FINDING OUR

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:41.284
HANDS ACTUALLY FORCING US. TO

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.219
WHACK THINGS THAT WE CARE A

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:45.121
GREAT DEAL ABOUT WHEN WE COULD

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:47.823
JUST HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL NOW

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.392
TO USE THE MONEY TO DO WHAT

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.160
NEEDS TO BE DONE TODAY.

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:53.496
WE ALSO DON'T HAVE A PLAN SO WE

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:56.699
HAVE A 2% 2% SOUNDS GREAT.

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:58.267
YOU CAN ARGUE WITH 2% A SOUNDS

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.469
LIKE BUDGET DUST THE WAY THAT WE

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:00.670
TALK.

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.805
ON WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE GOING

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:04.807
TO SPEND THE MONEY ON HOW MANY

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:06.609
YEARS WILL IT TAKE US TO DO IT

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:07.443
2%.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.446
FOREVER IS THAT EVEN THE RIGHT

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:11.714
AMOUNT WE DON'T KNOW.

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.050
BUT IF WE TOOK UP A PROP TO

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:15.384
APPROACH A RAINY DAY FUND

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:16.652
APPROACH WITHOUT ACTUALLY

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.854
PASSING A PROPOSITION BUT SANE.

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:20.356
WHEN THE BUDGET IS IN

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:22.825
CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE IT IS TODAY?

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:26.028
AND WE USE A PORTION OF THAT TO

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:27.930
WORK DOWN THAT PLAN.

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:29.632
THAT WOULD GET US ON A PATHWAY

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.434
TO SOLVING A LOT OF OUR WATER

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.436
INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS.

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:34.604
OF COURSE THE CHALLENGES WE

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:37.306
WOULD HAVE A LOT OF UNMET PLANS

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:38.674
THAT WE NEED TO DO FOR

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:40.843
CALIFORNIA -- SO OUR OUR TO DO

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:42.612
LIST IS PRETTY HIGH SO

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:44.580
APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT BY WHICH

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:46.415
YOU BROUGHT THIS.

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:48.117
JUST THERE'S NO PLAN.

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:49.518
IT BINDS OUR HANDS IN A WAY THAT

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:52.088
IN FACT FORCES US TO CUT.

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:54.123
SO MANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:56.025
CALIFORNIANS DEPEND UPON EVERY

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:59.729
DAY -- SO LET'S CONTINUE WORKING

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:01.897
ON THIS THANKS VERY MUCH

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:02.198
[inaudible]

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:03.132
THE MISSILES.

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:03.899
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS ABOUT

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.835
THIS APPRECIATE -- YOU BRING

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.470
THIS MEASURE BEFORE US I MEAN --

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:09.705
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS YOU KNOW

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.374
THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA'S GROW

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.842
TO OVER FORTY MILLION PEOPLE.

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:14.510
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAJOR

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.379
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN THE

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.247
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:19.649
LEGISLATURE HASN'T?

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:21.250
UP WITH THE MONEY.

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:22.952
WITH THAT GROWTH.

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:25.788
SO I DON'T SEE IT AS A AS A CUT

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:27.456
TO OTHER SERVICES I SEE IT AS

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:28.691
YOU KNOW SAME THING WE DO WITH

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:29.725
PROPOSITION.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.294
AT NINETY EIGHT FOR EDUCATION WE

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.762
SET ASIDE.

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.930
MONEY BECAUSE WE SAY THIS IS A

01:05:34.997 --> 01:05:36.699
PRIORITY FOR THE STATE.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.434
WATER IS ESSENTIAL FOR ANY

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:39.969
COMMUNITY TO GROW.

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:43.539
IT'S ESSENTIAL. FOR LIFE -- I

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.641
SEE THAT AS A THIS IS A STEP IN

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:46.609
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:47.943
ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.979
RESOLVE IN THE LANGUAGE AND THE

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:50.913
LEGISLATION I THINK THAT'S

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.716
SOMETHING -- THAT HAS SOME MERIT

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.017
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.253
BUT I SEE THIS COMPLETELY AS AN

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.121
INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA IN

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:00.823
CALIFORNIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE ONE

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.591
OF THE THE MAIN CHARGES. FOR US

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:04.527
I BELIEVE AS LEGISLATORS JUST TO

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:05.795
MAKE SURE THE GOVERNMENT WORKS.

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:07.129
AND AND TO ENSURE THAT

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:08.597
GOVERNMENT WORKS WE NEED TO HAVE

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:10.099
THE INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:11.133
GOVERNMENT TO WORK AND I SEE

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.535
THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:15.037
DIRECTION NOW BE VOTING I TODAY.

AS WE HERE OUR WATER IS SO IS

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:27.650
CENSURED FOR OUR LIFE SUSTAINING.

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:29.819
AND THE AGRICULTURE AND WAS

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:32.488
STATUS -- HEAVILY -- DEPEND ON

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:34.023
THE PHONE OKAY WE CULTURE SO

THIS IS SO -- MANAGEMENT AND

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:38.194
BUILDING NECESSARY

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.929
INFRASTRUCTURE.

AND ON OUR STATE -- HAS A WATER

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:47.203
PROBLEM -- AND THIS IS -- IS

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:48.371
ESSENTIAL.

ECONOMY SO I THINK THIS IS SO.

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:19.034
PROVIDING NECESSARY RESOURCES SO --

01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:22.104

ASIDE THAT THIS A SMALL AMOUNT

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:34.049
OF MONEY I THINK THIS IS.

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:41.490
NOT WEISS MANAGEMENT THE RATHER

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:44.727

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A HUMONGOUS

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.134
SURPLUSES.

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.602
IN RECENT YEARS I THINK THAT

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:54.970
WOULD NOT THE HURT OR THE

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:58.007

01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:04.580
WISE UTILIZATION OF OUR EXISTING

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:07.416
NOW READ A BUDGETARY RESOURCES.

I THINK WE'VE HAD A GOOD

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:23.032
CONVERSATION HERE.

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:26.769
IRRESPECTIVE OF UP THE POSITION --

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.237
THAT -- MEMBERS HERE ON THIS

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:32.107
COMMITTEE HAVE -- PRESENTED THE

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:34.477
THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY SEE

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:36.946
WITH THE CURRENT -- LANGUAGE

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:39.782
WITHOUT HAVING YOU PRESENT THIS --

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:41.050
MEASURE.

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:42.651
WE DON'T GET THIS FEEDBACK.

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.820
HI -- IT SITS IN RULES AND

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:47.890
ULTIMATELY THE IDEAS OF TRYING

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.225
TO ADDRESS WHAT I THINK EVERYONE

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.060
HERE HAS SAID AND AGREED WE HAVE

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:52.294
A WATER PROBLEM.

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:54.296
INCALIFORNIA WHETHER IT BE AN

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.631
INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM.

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:58.067
OR FOR THAT MATTER A DIRECT A

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.436
PUBLIC HEALTH -- PROBLEM

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:03.339
PERTAINING TO PEOPLE NOT HAVING

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:03.639
CLEAN WATER.

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:04.573
RIGHT.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.444
AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU STEPPING

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.745
INTO THE SPACE.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.547
AND WANTING TO SOLVE THIS

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:13.115
PROBLEM.

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:16.252
IT MAY NOT BE THE ACA MAY NOT BE

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:17.953
SOME BILL TWO ONE SEVEN AND MAY

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.022
NOT BE THE SENATE BILL THAT IS

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:22.958
TRYING TO ADDRESS -- THE CLEAN

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:25.427
DRINKING WATER BUT I THINK THE

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:25.728
COMMON IS.

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:27.696
LET'S TRY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.231
THIS YEAR -- WE HAVE SOME MONEY

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:30.799
IN THE BUDGET.

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.067
NOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:33.502
DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.604
OUT PUT FORWARD TO SUSTAINABLE

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:36.805
FUNDING SOURCES.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.941
I SEE THIS AS JUST ANOTHER

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:42.511
OPTION ON THE TABLE FOR US -- TO

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:45.948
DISCUSSED DELIBERATE DEBATE --

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.516
MISTER WOULD YOU BRING UP SOME

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.618
VERY GOOD POINTS AS IT RELATES

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.320
TO WHY 2%.

01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:53.088
RIGHT MAYBE WE NEED TO DO SOME

01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:54.557
MORE WORK ON FIGURING OUT WHAT

01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:56.192
THE NUMBER IS I WOULD HOPE THAT

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:57.660
THE NUMBER DOESN'T COME BACK.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:59.395
NEEDING TO BE 5%.

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.963
RIGHT THAT IT DOES.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.298
I THINK THE POINT HERE OF

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:04.466
DEDICATING PERCENTAGES THAT WE

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:05.935
HAVE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:06.936
SOURCE.

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:09.104
AND THAT MAY NOT BE THE WAY THAT

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:10.406
PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE

01:10:10.472 --> 01:10:12.241
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM BUT THAT

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:13.776
IS A PROPOSAL RIGHT THAT WE

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:16.145
OUGHT TO LOOK AT THE DETAILS.

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:18.847
OF HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT IS.

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:20.816
THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS --

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:23.586
PRIORITIZING REGIONS PROJECTS

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.821
AND AGAIN THE ONE MILLION PEOPLE

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:26.689
THAT DON'T HAVE SAFE CLEAN

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:27.990
DRINKING WATER I WOULD IMAGINE

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.725
WOULD BE.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.093
AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.094
SO WE DON'T BRING THIS

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:34.563
RESOLUTION FORWARD THAT WE DON'T

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.565
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION -- AND WE

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:39.301
STAY ON THE SAME.

WHICH I WILL USE FOR MY

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:04.079
PRESENTATION I'VE BEEN ASKED TO

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:05.780
I THINK GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:07.415
BOTH FOR THE DISCUSSION YOU JUST

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:08.850
HAD AS WELL AS THE DISCUSSION

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.819
THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO HAVE --

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:12.921
REGARDING FUNDING FOR WATER

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:14.856
RELATED ACTIVITIESSO -- I'LL

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:15.890
START WITH KIND OF AN OVERVIEW

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.392
OF EXISTING FUNDING WITH A

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:18.760
PARTICULAR FOCUS ON BONDS SINCE

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.862
THAT'S BEEN A BIG -- SOURCE OF

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.564
STATE FUNDING FOR WATER RELATED

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.399
ACTIVITIES AND THEN JUST TALK

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.000
VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME IDEAS

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:27.535
AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR OTHER

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:29.471
OPTIONS FOR FUNDING WATER

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:30.805
RELATED ACTIVITIES.

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.607
AT IN OUR HAND IT IS ON OUR

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:33.942
WEBSITE M..

01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:36.845
L. A. O. DOT CA DOT GOV FOR

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:37.445
THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE IN THE

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:38.113
ROOM.

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:40.448
SO TURNING TO PAGE.

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:41.583
ONE OUR COLLEAGUE THAT PP I SEE

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:43.118
WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM NEXT HAVE

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.652
DONE SOME WORK LOOKING AT

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.888
EXISTING FUNDING AND SPENDING ON

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:48.189
WATER RELATED ACTIVITIES AND

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:50.625
ESTIMATE THAT IT'S ABOUT THIRTY

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.026
THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:53.561
THE BULK OF THIS IS THAT THE

01:23:53.628 --> 01:23:56.431
LOCAL LEVEL ABOUT 85% HALF FROM

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.767
LOCAL SOURCES SO WE TALK A LOT

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.935
HERE ABOUT STATE FUNDING FOR

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:02.937
WATER -- BUT REALLY THAT THAT IS

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:05.440
THE SMALLER SHARE ABOUT 12%.

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:07.575
OF PP I SEE ESTIMATES SO

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:09.444
CERTAINLY IMPORTANT -- AND

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:10.879
CERTAINLY THE BIGGEST PIECE

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:12.213
THAT'S IN YOUR PER PER VIEW AS

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.548
THE LEGISLATURE BUT ABOUT A

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:16.050
REALLY SMALL RELATIVELY PIECE OF

01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:18.486
THE OVERALL -- PIE.

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:19.954
AND MOST OF THAT STATE FUNDING

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:22.190
IS RELATED TO BONDS EITHER IN

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.792
BOND FUNDING THAT GOES OUT EACH

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:26.161
YEAR OR IN GENERAL FUND FOR THE

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.395
DEBT SERVICE ON THIS MONTH'S

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:28.930
THERE IS SOME GENERAL FUND FOR

01:24:28.997 --> 01:24:30.465
WATER RELATED ACTIVITIES TO BUT

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:33.401
MUCH MORE MINOR COMPARED TO THE

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:33.835
BONDS AND THE DEBT.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:34.969
SERVICE.

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.805
SO TURNING TO PAGE TWO JUST

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.373
LOOKING AT WHAT THE RECENT BONDS

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.708
ARE AM AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THESE

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:41.943
ARE THE WATER.

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.711
AND NATURAL RESOURCES RELATED

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:45.180
BONDS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:46.881
TOTALING THIRTY ONE BILLION

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:50.151
DOLLARS -- FOR VINCE THERE ARE

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:51.352
PIECES OF THIS THAT AREN'T WATER

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:52.687
YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME PARKS MANY

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:54.289
IN HERE AND HABITAT MANY IN HERE

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:55.990
AS WELL BUT BUT MOSTLY WATER

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:57.258
RELATED.

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:59.160
OUT MOST OF THE SPENDING AT IS

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:01.563
EITHER COMMITTED TO PROJECTS OR

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:03.731
ALREADY SPENT ON PROJECTS.

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:05.567
THE EXCEPTIONS DOWN SOME OF THE

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.001
MORE RECENT ONES.

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:10.038
AS WAS DISCUSSED AT LENGTH -- IN

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:12.340
IN YOUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:15.143
BONDS ARE NOT CHEAP MANY -- THEY

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.345
ARE THEY DO AT CARRIE INTERESTS

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:18.880
SO WE ESTIMATE THAT FOR ABOUT

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.515
EACH DOLLAR THAT IS BORROWED IT

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:22.083
COSTS ABOUT A DOLLAR AND THIRTY

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:23.284
CENTS WENT TO TAKE INTO.

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:26.087
ACCOUNT INFLATION PAID OVERTIME --

01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:27.755
FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR THAT

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:28.790
JOB ON DEBT AND WE'RE WE'RE

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:29.757
SPENDING RIGHT NOW ABOUT A

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:31.426
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IT FROM

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:34.262
OUR GENERAL FUND. FOR BOND DEBT

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:36.297
AT JET SERVICE RELATED TO

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:41.069
NATURAL RESOURCES BONDS THAT

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:42.136
HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THE VOTERS.

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:42.770
SO TURNING TO PAGE THREE

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:43.371
FOCUSING A LITTLE BIT MORE ON

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:45.406
THOSE WATER COMPONENTS OF THOSE

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:46.508
RESET OF THE TWO MOST RECENT

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:47.976
BONDS YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:49.177
ACTIVITIES.

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:50.979
ARE THAT PROPOSITION ONE IN

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:52.447
PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FUNDED

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:54.315
ARE RELATED TO WATER.

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:55.517
THAT SECOND CATEGORY THE WATER

01:25:55.583 --> 01:25:57.085
SYDNEY BECAUSE SYSTEM PROTECTION

01:25:57.151 --> 01:25:57.986
RESTORATION.

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:59.587
THERE MAY BE SOME IS THAT SOME

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:00.555
WOULD QUIBBLE WITH SOME OF THOSE

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.023
PROJECTS BEING WATER RELATED BUT

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.458
THERE'S A CLOSE NEXUS THINGS

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:05.493
LIKE AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.662
BROUGHT UP -- WATERSHED HEALTH

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.230
AND WATERSHED -- FOREST

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:10.632
MANAGEMENT THAT THAT CAN BE

01:26:10.698 --> 01:26:11.900
RELATED TO WATER BECAUSE

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:13.601
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHERE MOST OF

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:16.905
OUR WATER ORIGINATES -- SO OF

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:19.507
THESE FUNDS FOR PROPOSITION ONE

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:21.342
MOST OF IT HAS BEEN THE VAST

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:22.210
MAJORITY HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:23.678
BY THE LEGISLATURE AND MOST OF

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:25.280
IT IS COMMITTED TO PROJECTS

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:26.681
ALREADY KIND OF SPOKEN.

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:28.016
FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT OBVIOUSLY

01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:29.717
JUST PASSED LESS THAN A YEAR AGO

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.653
SO THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE OF

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:33.254
THAT MANY KIND OF AVAILABLE.

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:34.522
BUT IF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:35.890
PROPOSALS ARE ADOPTED BY THE

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:37.458
LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR IT WILL BE

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:39.227
ABOUT HALF OF PROP SIXTY EIGHT

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.028
THAT WILL BE APPROPRIATED

01:26:40.094 --> 01:26:41.596
ALREADY EVEN WITHIN THE FIRST

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:44.933
YEAR -- OUT FOR PROJECTS.

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:46.067
AND THEN JUST A NOTE I THINK

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:47.769
THIS WAS ALSO DISCUSSED A BIT

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:49.771
EARLIER BUT BOND FUNDS ARE

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:51.706
USUALLY USED FOR LARGE PROJECTS

01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:54.642
THAT -- ARE PAID FOR OVERTIME

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.144
NOT USUALLY USED FOR ONGOING

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:57.745
ACTIVITIES LIKE OPERATIONS AND

01:26:57.812 --> 01:26:58.780
MAINTENANCE ON THEIR SEVERAL

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:00.315
REASONS FOR THAT ONE IS THAT

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:01.549
IT'S ONE TIME MANY SO IT DOESN'T

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:02.850
MAKE SENSE TO COMMIT FOR AN

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:05.186
ONGOING PURPOSE -- AND ALSO

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:07.088
BECAUSE IT IS FUTURE TAXPAYERS

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:08.890
WHO ARE PAYING FOR IT BIG WITH

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:10.224
THE INTEREST OVER TIME IT MAKES

01:27:10.291 --> 01:27:11.626
SENSE FOR IT TO BE.

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:13.194
SPENT ON LARGE PROJECTS THAT

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:17.599
THOSE FUTURE TAXPAYERS WILL ALSO

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:18.800
BENEFIT FROM.

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:20.201
SO TURNING TO PAGE FOUR ALTHOUGH

01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:21.469
WE HAVE ALL OF THIS EXISTING

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:23.605
FUNDING AS HAS BEEN A BIG THEME

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:25.373
OF YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY --

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.442
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF NEEDS --

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:30.211
DESPITE THESE FUNDS M..

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:31.346
THEY RESULT FROM AGING

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:33.047
INFRASTRUCTURE GROWING

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:34.616
POPULATION.

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:35.750
INCREASE AND REGULATORY

01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:37.952
REQUIREMENTS -- AND THERE ARE A

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:39.487
LOT OF CONSTRAINTS ON THE ON THE

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:41.623
FUNDING AND AND ABILITY TO RAISE

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:44.692
EXISTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING --

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:47.328
THAT IS BOTH RELATED TO CAPACITY

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:48.630
IN CERTAIN AREAS SOME

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:49.764
COMMUNITIES THAT CAN'T RAISE

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:50.965
ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECAUSE OF

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:52.266
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:54.402
COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS

01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:56.270
REQUIREMENTS AROUND HOW YOU CAN

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:57.905
RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:59.040
PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:00.408
PROPOSITION TWO TWENTY SIX

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:01.542
PROPOSITION. THIRTEEN SOME OF

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.444
THESE -- CONSTRAINTS THAT VOTERS

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:05.013
HAVE CHOSEN TO PLACE AROUND THE

01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:06.414
ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:09.917
REVENUES -- SO WE HAVE BEEN

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:12.020
ASKED MANY TIMES AND YOU HAVE

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:13.788
DISCUSSED MANY TIMES SOME OF

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:15.089
THESE OTHER OPTIONS AS JUST.

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:17.759
WAS ALLUDED TO BY THE CHAIR SO

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.494
HERE ON PAGE FOUR WE HAVE SOME

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.029
OF THE OPTIONS THAT ARE

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:22.997
REGULARLY TALKED ABOUT BY THE

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:25.199
LEGISLATURE -- THERE ARE STATE

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:27.969
LEVEL FUNDING SOURCES USUALLY.

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:28.736
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:30.038
RAISING THE REVENUES IT'S EITHER

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:33.041
FEES WHICH ARE DIRECTLY RELATED

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.709
TO HOW THE FUNDING WILL BE USED?

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:37.879
OR TAXES -- WHICH AS OFTEN MORE

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:39.547
RELATED TO HOW THE FUNDING IS

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:43.785
GENERATED -- SO THEIR REGULATORY

THEY'RE ALSO ACTIONS YOU CAN

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:25.059
TAKE TO AUTHORIZE LOCALS TO BE

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:26.394
ABLE TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:27.962
FUNDING THAT WOULDN'T BE KIND OF

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:28.763
AUTOMATIC THESE TWO AT THE

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:29.564
BOTTOM.

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:31.299
BUT WOULD PROVIDE MORE THIRTY

01:29:31.365 --> 01:29:32.500
FOR LOCALS THESE HAVE BEEN

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:35.470
TALKED ABOUT TRYING -- TO ADOPT

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:36.471
SOME CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THAT

01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:37.805
WOULD ALLOW MORE FLEXIBILITY AT

01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:39.741
THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR RAISING

01:29:39.807 --> 01:29:40.875
REVENUES.

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:43.945
SO TURNING TO PAGE.

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:45.079
FIVE JUST SOME BROAD

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:46.781
CONSIDERATIONS AS YOU MAY BE

THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:50.618
OPTIONS -- AND WANT TO FIGURE

01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:52.120
OUT WHICH ARE THE **** MOST

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:53.187
APPROPRIATE THESE ARE SOME OF

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:54.822

UNDERTAKE AND THAT CAN HELP

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.531
GUIDE SOME OF THE REVENUE

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:04.699
OPTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:05.566
THINK ABOUT.

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:06.868
WHO ARE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:08.469
WHAT WOULD YOU BE UNDERTAKING

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:09.704
WITH THE FUNDING?

01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:10.872
REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:12.340
BENEFICIARIES AND RESPONSIBLE

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:14.308
PARTY SO YOU CAN DRAW THAT NEXUS

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:15.676
BETWEEN THE FUNDING WHO'S

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.411
BENEFITING FROM IT IF IT'S A

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:19.113
BROAD ACTIVITY THAT STATE WIDE

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.782
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT A

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:23.151
MORE BROAD -- SOURCE OF FUNDING

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:25.219
COMPARED TO IF THERE'S A BENEFIT

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:27.155
REALLY AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ARE

01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:28.856
FOR ONE PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:33.661
OF ENTITY -- AND THEN THINKING

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:34.495
ABOUT HOW THAT FUNDING WOULD BE

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:35.530
USED AS AN IMPORTANT

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:37.064
CONSIDERATION TO PARTICULARLY IF

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:38.533
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- FUNDING

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:39.600
AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL WITH

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:41.369
PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX IF IT'S A

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:43.938
FEE THE USE OF THE FUNDING HAS

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:47.542
TO BE REALLY RELATED -- TO THOSE

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:49.343
WHO ARE PAYING THE FEE.

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.078
I HOW MUCH REVENUE DO YOU NEED

01:30:51.145 --> 01:30:52.380
IF IT'S A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:53.447
DOLLAR A YEAR PROBLEM THEN

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:54.549
PURSUING A REVENUE OPTION THAT

01:30:54.615 --> 01:30:56.117
RAISES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:57.485
YEAR PROBABLY ISN'T WORTH IT.

01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:59.187
AND WON'T GET YOU THERE AND ALSO

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.389
THINKING ABOUT THE VOLATILITY OR

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:02.757
STABILITY OF THAT REVENUE AS

01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:04.025
WELL IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:04.959
FINDING SOMETHING LIKE

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:06.260
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE WERE

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:07.495
STAFF WILL BE HIRED AND THE

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:09.263
NEEDS OF THE SAME EVERY YEAR.

01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:10.965
BUT YOU PURSUER HAVE REVENUE

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:11.833
SOURCE THAT MAY BE REALLY

01:31:11.899 --> 01:31:13.835
VOLATILE EACH YEAR THEN YOU MAY

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:15.970
RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO LINKING UP

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:17.672
AGAIN THAT NEXUS OF WHAT IS THAT

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:19.040
FUNDING COMING FROM AND HOW

01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:20.541
EXACTLY DO YOU WANT TO USE IT

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:22.143
WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU TRYING TO

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:23.010
SOLVE.

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:26.280
RIGHT SIZING THE SOLUTION WITH

01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:26.948
THE PROBLEM.

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:29.784
AND THEN FINALLY TURNING TO PAGE

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.185
SIX THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:32.453
NITTY GRITTY.

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.888
ENACTMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.556
CONSIDERATIONS OF SOME OF THESE

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:36.624
OPTIONS.

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.159
WHAT WITH THE VOTE REQUIREMENTS

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:40.561
BE WHAT KIND OF DATA IS

01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:43.164
NECESSARY -- IN ORDER TO ENACT

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:44.732
SOMETHING AS SOME SOME OF THESE

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.767
OPTIONS AND IS THAT AVAILABLE

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:50.004
HOW COMPLICATED WOULD IT BE --

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.772
TO IMPLEMENTED IF IT TAKES A LOT

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:52.907
OF ADMINISTRATION AND A LOT OF

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:54.008
PEOPLE IN A LOT OF FUNDING IT'S

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:55.476
ONLY RAISING A COUPLE MILLION

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:56.811
DOLLARS IS THAT WORTH IT.

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:59.313
SO THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THOSE

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.348
CONSIDERATIONS.

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:01.482
HOW MUCH LATITUDE WILL WOULD

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:02.917
THERE BE OVER HOW THE FUNDING IS

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:04.352
USED VERSUS HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:05.653
PRESCRIBE HOW THE FUNDING IS

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.855
USED AND THEN WHAT OVERSIGHT

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.824
WOULD THERE BE FOR YOU AS A

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:11.192
LEGISLATIVE BODY BUT ALSO FOR

01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:12.627
THE PUBLIC TO KNOW HOW FUNDS ARE

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:14.495
USED AND?

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:14.962
AND HOW THEY'RE BEING

01:32:15.029 --> 01:32:15.963
IMPLEMENTED.

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.999
SAY I THINK THE BIG TAKE AWAY IS

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:19.267
THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.369
FUNDING AVAILABLE NOW FOR WATER

01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:22.837
RELATED ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO.

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:24.338
QUITE A BIT IN NEEDS THERE ARE

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:27.408
OPTIONS FOR YOU AS A LEGISLATURE

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:29.176
TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS.

01:32:29.243 --> 01:32:30.645
BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO THINK

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.246
CAREFULLY ABOUT WHICH OF THOSE

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.547
OPTIONS YOU WANT TO PURSUE AND

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.782
HOW WELL IT ALIGNS WITH THE

01:32:34.849 --> 01:32:36.050
PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.018

OUR OFFICE DOES NOT TAKE A

01:33:55.529 --> 01:33:56.263
POSITION ON BILLS -- AND WE

01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:57.164
HAVEN'T LOOKED CAREFULLY AT AC

01:33:57.231 --> 01:33:58.332
THREE IN THE NEEDS I KNOW THAT

01:33:58.399 --> 01:33:59.433
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES M.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.135
M. PPC MAY BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:02.136
THIS BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE A LOT

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:03.804
OF WORK AT LOOKING AT SOME OF

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.473
THE CATEGORIES OF FUNDING THAT

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:06.307
IT KIND OF OUR FUNDING.

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:08.342
ORPHANS IS HOW THEY HAVE TURNED

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:09.777
THEM THAT THAT DON'T HAVE A A

01:34:09.844 --> 01:34:11.078
STREAM OF FINDING.

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.213
THINGS LIKE DISADVANTAGED

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:14.348
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SARSI CAN

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:17.051
WATER -- FLOOD MANAGEMENT IS

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:18.819
ANOTHER ECOSYSTEM SO I KNOW THAT

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:20.287
THERE ARE SOME CATEGORIES OF

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:22.423
ACTIVITIES AND SOME ESTIMATES

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.758
OUT THERE FOR SOME OF THOSE

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:24.959
CATEGORIES BUT BUT OUR OFFICE

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:26.694
HASN'T TAKEN A CAREFUL LOOK AT

01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:30.431
AC THREE OR QUANTIFIED THE NEED.

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.433
LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSIONS SO

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.770
WHILE AGO DO YOU PLAN TO HAVE A

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:38.873
SOME ANALYSIS ON THAT -- 2%

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:42.009
SUGGESTION -- WE DON'T TYPICALLY

01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:44.745
DO ANALYSES OF OF EVERY SINGLE

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:45.746
BILL THAT COMES THAT'S USUALLY

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:46.847
THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:48.315
THAT COMES WERE HAPPY TO BE A

01:34:48.382 --> 01:34:49.650

POSITION FOR YOU TO TAKE -- I'M

01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:59.693
NOT ASKING FOR IT TO TAKE ANY

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.129
POSITION BUT THE ANALYSIS OF

01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:05.833
WHETHER THAT AMOUNT THAT WOULD

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.469
SOLVE ALL WALK ON WATER RELATED

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:09.570
ISSUES.

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:11.405
SO THAT THE NOVEL QUESTIONS SO

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:12.940
THAT THE RAISED UP BY THE MEMBER

01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:14.909
COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- CANDY AND

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:22.616
SODA -- WITH THE SOME NOW --

01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:24.652
VALID POINTS SAID THAT TO YOU

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:26.153
YOUR DEPARTMENT DOES.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.522
IS SO THAT THE ANNA BASED UPON --

01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:31.759
YOUR ANALYSIS OF THAT AMOUNT OF

01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:34.295
MONEY WHAT KIND WHAT.

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:35.696
PROBLEMS THAT THAT WAS.

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:37.531
WHETHER THAT'LL BE TOO MUCH WORK

01:35:37.598 --> 01:35:38.766
THOSE.

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:42.002
TWO OF TOO SHORT.

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:42.636
NO.

01:35:42.703 --> 01:35:44.371
OBVIOUSLY WE DO HAVE -- WATER

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:45.706
ISSUES I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:47.908
TRY TO SOLVE WHEN THE LOCALLY --

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:51.011
SPORADICALLY HERE HAPHAZARD MASS

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:54.048
THOUGHT THE THAN NOT COORDINATED

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:55.316
I HAVE PHOTO LOCALLY THROUGH

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:58.686
ISSUING BONDS SO -- SO THESE.

01:35:58.752 --> 01:35:59.854
ARE THE TWO PERCENTAGE

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.323
SUGGESTION OUR DEDICATED TO

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:04.692
EVERY EVERY YEAR THAT WAS

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:06.160
SOMEWHAT OF A LONG TERM.

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:08.195
BASED UPON THE POPULATION GROWTH

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.463
THE PROJECTIONS SO.

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:12.133
AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS A

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:13.767
FAILING -- SO I THOUGHT THAT

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:21.942
THAT WAS SO GOOD THE LONG TERM

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:23.577
ARE ESSENTIAL.

01:36:23.644 --> 01:36:25.246
PLANNING FOR OUR STATE.

01:36:25.312 --> 01:36:28.516
BUT THE SURPRISING ME -- THEY

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:29.850
TOOK DIFFERENT POSITIONS SO

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:30.484
THAT'S WHY.

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:34.755
THAT'S WHY -- I THOUGHT THE YOUR

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:36.757
DEPARTMENT SO.

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:39.360
ANALYSIS OF THAT THE WEATHER

01:36:39.426 --> 01:36:42.830
THAT THE AMOUNT 22% IS A VALID.

01:36:42.897 --> 01:36:43.697
IT MAKES SENSE OR NOT THAT MAY

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:45.366
HELP.

01:36:45.432 --> 01:36:46.033
YEAH I MEAN I GET AGAIN WE DON'T

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:46.567
HAVE A PRACTICE OF DOING

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:47.735
ANALYSES OF EVERY SINGLE BILL

01:36:47.801 --> 01:36:49.236
BUT AT ME IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:51.438
REQUESTS THAT COME TO US WE CAN

01:36:51.505 --> 01:36:52.640
LOOK AT THAT A DOCTOR.

01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:53.407
I TIRE OF I THINK THAT'S

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:54.842
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

01:36:54.909 --> 01:36:56.544
CONSIDERED BY THE AUTHOR.

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:58.812
OR AUTHORS OF THE BILL --

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:00.514
WHETHER IT BE SPECIFICALLY -- TO

01:37:00.581 --> 01:37:02.850
ACA THREE OR JUST IN GENERAL

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:04.818
WANTING TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE

01:37:04.885 --> 01:37:07.221
OUTSTANDING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:08.789
OF THE STATE AND SO WE CERTAINLY

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:10.124
WILL WILL CONSIDER THAT.

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:11.525
AND I THINK WHEN WHEN IMPORTANT

01:37:11.592 --> 01:37:14.061
CONSIDERATION TO AS AS AS AS I

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:15.162
ALLUDED TO THE END OF THINKING

01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:16.363
ABOUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WHAT

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:18.032
IS THE SOLUTION NOT ONLY LOOKING

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:19.633
AT WHAT ARE THE NEEDS BUT WHAT

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.936
IS THE FORECAST FOR THE GENERAL

01:37:22.002 --> 01:37:23.704
FUND IN THE FUTURE -- YOU KNOW

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:27.041
YOU'D WANT TO KIND OF LINE THOSE

01:37:27.107 --> 01:37:29.043
UP AS WELL [inaudible]

01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:30.978
HIS OFFICE.

01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:31.845
THANK YOU MISTER I WAS JUST

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:33.447
GONNA KIND OF ASK.

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:35.149
MAYBE TO HELP -- SOMEONE OVER

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:36.817
TROY.

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:38.085
OF THE BONDS THAT YOU LOOKED AT

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:40.287
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEVERAL LISTED

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:44.825
EVEN ON PAGE. TWO ONE TWO THREE

01:37:44.892 --> 01:37:45.693
FOUR THERE'S LIKE SEVEN OR EIGHT

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:47.394
OF THAT OF THE THE BONDS THAT

01:37:47.461 --> 01:37:49.330
WERE ISSUED TO ME WHAT WAS.

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:51.165
HOW LONG BEFORE THEY WERE

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:52.666
ACTUALLY FULLY UTILIZED?

01:37:52.733 --> 01:37:55.536
THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH SO.

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:56.770
IT GENERALLY WELL THEY'RE

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:59.273
GENERALLY KIND OF PAID OFF OVER

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.242
THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS -- PARTLY

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:02.676
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE USUALLY

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:05.346
PAID ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS SO

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:06.614
USUALLY TAKES A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.215
TO GET THE PROGRAMS KINDA UP AND

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:09.917
RUNNING AND THEN FOLKS APPLY FOR

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:10.684
THEM AND THEN THEY GET THE GRANT

01:38:10.751 --> 01:38:11.285
AWARDS.

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:12.586
AND THEN THEY UNDERTAKE THE

01:38:12.653 --> 01:38:14.989
PROJECTS AND THEN THEY GET PAID

01:38:15.055 --> 01:38:15.823
BACK.

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:16.790
AND THEN THE STATE PAYS FOR THEM

01:38:16.857 --> 01:38:18.926
SO IT TYPICALLY IS YOU KNOW OF A

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:20.561
FEW DECADES UNTIL THEY'RE ALL

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:21.862
YOU CAN SEE HERE.

01:38:21.929 --> 01:38:24.898
I EVEN ON THIS CHART THERE ARE --

01:38:24.965 --> 01:38:26.667
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN IN MARCH

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:28.235
TWO THOUSAND SET AT TWO THOUSAND

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:29.336
WAS PASSED BY THE OTERS THERE

01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:31.705
ARE STILL DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET

01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:33.807
PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE BEFORE YOU

01:38:33.874 --> 01:38:35.676
IN JUNE OF SPENDING PROP

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:37.077
THIRTEEN DOLLARS SO.

01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:39.647
IT TYPICALLY DOES TAKE --

01:38:39.713 --> 01:38:41.248
SEVERAL YEARS FOR THOSE DOLLARS

01:38:41.315 --> 01:38:43.017
TO GET FULLY UTILIZED.

01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:44.818
BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH PROP ONE

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:46.720
THAT JUST PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND

01:38:46.787 --> 01:38:47.454
FOURTEEN NEARLY ALL OF THOSE

01:38:47.521 --> 01:38:48.722
DOLLARS NOT QUITE ALL OF THEM

01:38:48.789 --> 01:38:50.157
BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:52.059
COMMITTED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:53.560
NOW SO I THINK THERE IS.

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:54.395
CLEARLY A LOT OF DEMAND OUT

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:56.397
THERE BUT IT DOES TAKE AWHILE

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:58.766
FOR ALL THE DOLLARS TO GET KIND

01:38:58.832 --> 01:39:00.601
OF FULLY UTILIZED.

01:39:00.668 --> 01:39:01.268
GOT IT MAYBE THAT JUST SPEAKS TO

01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:02.870
THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS.

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:04.938
OF THE STATE KIND OF INFORMING

01:39:05.005 --> 01:39:06.607
OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION.

01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:09.743
ABOUT -- THE HUGE NEED.

01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:10.911
SO I GUESS ONE THING FOR US TO

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:12.246
CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD IS

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:13.180
THE DEBT SERVICE THAT WERE

01:39:13.247 --> 01:39:14.948
PAYING ON THE BONDS AS OPPOSED

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:17.151
TO A DIRECT ALLOCATION. FOR

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:18.952
INVESTMENT APPRECIATE THAT I

01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:20.654
THINK UP WITH ANY THAT'S PART OF

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.222
THE PURPOSE OF HAVING THAT

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:24.191
CONVERSATION RIGHT.

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:25.926
IS TO THE BILL DO A COST BENEFIT

01:39:25.993 --> 01:39:28.128
ANALYSIS OF HOW WE'RE PAYING FOR

01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:30.764
IT RIGHT -- WHETHER OR NOT --

01:39:30.831 --> 01:39:33.400
IT'S FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE TO

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:34.468
CONTINUE.

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:35.969
TO USE THE SAME PRACTICE BUT

01:39:36.036 --> 01:39:38.105
THAT WAS THE PRIOR CONVERSATION

01:39:38.172 --> 01:39:39.540
AND AND NOW.

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:40.607
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS I I DID

01:39:40.674 --> 01:39:42.910
HAVE A QUESTION AND AT WHAT

01:39:42.976 --> 01:39:44.678
POINT DO YOU THINK -- THE ALLEY

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:48.248
OLD OFFICE IS IN A GOOD POSITION --

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:51.752
TOO BUT ANALYZE -- VIA A REQUEST

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:54.655
YOU KNOW -- D. DIRECT --

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:58.625
ALLOCATIONS -- BY [inaudible]

01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:03.564
YELP POPULATION BY REGION -- BY

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:05.299
NEED AND THERE'S ALWAYS THIS

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:07.334
QUESTION.

01:40:07.401 --> 01:40:08.669
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:10.270
NEW FUNDING MECHANISMS ARE NEW

01:40:10.337 --> 01:40:11.538
BONDS

01:40:11.605 --> 01:40:13.374
WELL WE ALREADY FUNDED THAT IS

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.441
SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR QUITE

01:40:14.508 --> 01:40:17.478
OFTEN WE WE ALREADY FUNDED THAT --

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:19.747
WE ALREADY -- DID THAT BUT IT

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:23.317
NEVER MADE IT TO IT'S INTENDED --

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:25.719
PURPOSE SO I THINK AT SOME POINT

01:40:25.786 --> 01:40:27.955
AND DOUBT WHEN IS THE QUESTION.

01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:31.692
IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR THE ALLEY --

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:32.659
TO LOOK AT UPON LIKE.

01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:33.227
SIXTY EIGHT RIGHT THE MOST

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:35.162
RECENT ONE TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:38.065
AND LOOK AT ITS INTENTION.

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:41.402
AND ULTIMATELY IT'S OUTCOMES --

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:43.070
SO PLEASE CAN AT NIGHT HELP ME

01:40:43.137 --> 01:40:45.572
IT YEAH I THINK M. AND TO SOME

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:47.441
REMEMBER SAUCES QUESTION IT DOES

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:47.908
IS.

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:49.643
PROBABLY TOO PREMATURE FOR PROP

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:50.444
SIXTY EIGHT SINCE THOSE DOLLARS

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:52.279
ARE STILL GETTING OUT THE DOOR --

01:40:52.346 --> 01:40:53.814
YOU MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE EARLY

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:55.182
FOR PROP ONE BUT WE COULD START

01:40:55.249 --> 01:40:57.518
SEEING SOME OF IT -- SOME OF THE

01:40:57.584 --> 01:40:59.353
EARLIER ONES MAYBE BECAUSE IT

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:00.220
DOES TAKE SO LONG TO GET THE

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:01.622
DOLLARS AND SO LOOKING AT WHAT

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:03.524
PROJECTS WERE FUNDED WHERE WHERE

01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:04.925
THOSE PROJECTS FUNDED.

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:07.494
DID THE PROJECTS -- ACHIEVE WHAT

01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:10.097
THEY INTENDED I THINK SOME OF

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:11.698
THE DISCUSSION AND I AND I CAN'T

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:13.300
RECALL FORGIVE ME IF IT WAS BEEN

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:13.934
IN THIS WHEN I'VE BEEN BEFORE

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:15.335
THIS COMMITTEE BUT SOME OF THE

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.603
LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES OVER THE

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:18.172
PAST SEVERAL MONTHS.

01:41:18.238 --> 01:41:19.840
HAVE STARTED ASKING -- REALLY

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:21.442
GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:22.576
KNOW THAT WE'RE ACHIEVING WHAT

01:41:22.643 --> 01:41:24.244
WE WANT TO ACHIEVE PARTICULARLY

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:25.813
IN THE IN A CHANGING CLIMATE AND

01:41:25.879 --> 01:41:27.581
TRADITIONALLY WITH BONDS THE WAY

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:29.082
WE HAVE EVALUATED THAT IS.

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:30.284
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.186
THIS PROJECT DID YOU DO THE

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:34.788
PROJECT YES CHECK DONE.

01:41:34.855 --> 01:41:36.390
BUT I THINK MOVING A LITTLE BIT

01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:38.759
MORE INTO SOME OF THE AREAS OF

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:40.027
WHAT DID WE WHAT WERE OUR

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:41.829
INTENTIONS AND DID WE ACHIEVE

01:41:41.895 --> 01:41:43.230
THOSE INTENTIONS IF WE WANT A

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:44.031
PARTICULAR FOR SOME OF THESE

01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:45.632
ECOSYSTEM PROJECTS FOR LOOKING

01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:52.973
FOR MORE RESILIENT -- ECOSYSTEM

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.075
AND FOR BEING RESTORING WETLANDS

01:41:55.142 --> 01:41:57.678
THAT WE WANT TO HELP -- BUT FOR

01:41:57.744 --> 01:41:58.445
WELL OKAY SO YOU RESTORE THE

01:41:58.512 --> 01:42:00.047
PROJECT BUT BUT DID ACHIEVE THAT

01:42:00.113 --> 01:42:01.448
OUTCOME AND I THINK THAT GETS A

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:03.417
LITTLE HARDER BECAUSE IT'S EASY

01:42:03.484 --> 01:42:04.451
TO SAY DID YOU BUILD A WATER

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:05.586
PLANT YES PEOPLE TO WATER PLANT

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:06.553
WERE DONE.

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:07.621
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT SOME

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:09.823
OF THAT OUTCOME BASED -- YOU

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:10.891
HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.459
DIFFERENT MEASURES YOU HAVE TO

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:13.927
BRING SCIENCE INTO A LOT MORE

01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:15.929
AND YOU HAVE TO PROBABLY HAVE SO

01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:18.365
MANY FOR ONGOING MONITORING SO.

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:19.633
I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLY

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:20.567
ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:21.335
THAT PARTICULAR IF YOU'RE

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:22.469
THINKING ABOUT NEW BONDS

01:42:22.536 --> 01:42:24.638
BUILDING THAT IN TO TRY AND

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:25.973
START LOOKING AT DID YOU NOT

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:27.107
JUST SAY WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:28.141
GOING TO DO BUT DID YOU DO WHAT

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:29.877
WE WANT YOU TO DO AND AND YOU.

01:42:29.943 --> 01:42:31.445
HAVE TO STRUCTURE THAT A LITTLE

01:42:31.512 --> 01:42:34.748
BIT DIFFERENTLY I THINK.

01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:35.282
OF COURSE.

01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:37.117
THIS BILL OF JUST HAVING WORKED

01:42:37.184 --> 01:42:39.520
ON ONE OF THOSE WATER BONDS AND

01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:41.255
AND KNOWING.

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:43.056
WHAT YOU JUST SAID THAT WAS

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:44.391
SOMETHING THAT WE ALL REALLY

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:45.659
WANTED TO GET DOWN BUT?

01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:48.962
COULDN'T GET THAT DONE OR SIGNED.

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:49.863
BY THE GOVERNOR IF WE PUT THAT

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.432
TYPE OF LANGUAGE IN THERE I

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:54.034
THINK MR SOLACE IT'S IN A PRETTY

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:55.369
SQUARE ON THE HEAD THERE.

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:56.937
WE REALLY HAVE TO START LOOKING

01:42:57.004 --> 01:42:58.605
AT A MORE PROACTIVE DEDICATED

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:02.175
BAND OF FUNDING SOURCE -- FROM

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:05.445
THE FROM THE GENERAL FUND IF YOU

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:07.180
WILL I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE

01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:08.282
CHAIR WAS TRYING.

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:09.449
TO LOOK AT WHAT WE CERTAINLY

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.018
DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE AT AS MR

01:43:11.084 --> 01:43:12.519
QUIRK IS MENTIONED AND OTHERS

01:43:12.586 --> 01:43:14.221
MENTIONED EARLIER.

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:14.788
WE DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:17.190
BALLOT BOX -- FOR EVERYTHING WE

01:43:17.257 --> 01:43:18.792
DO WANT TO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:19.693
BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE PROBLEM

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.495
IS WE DON'T HAVE THE DISCIPLINE

01:43:21.562 --> 01:43:22.629
TO CONTROL.

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:27.034
WE TEND TO SHIFT OUR PRIORITIES.

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.368
WITH THE WHIMS OF WHATEVER'S

01:43:28.435 --> 01:43:29.903
HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT.

01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:31.805
FORGETTING THINGS WHICH OFTEN

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:34.908
CAUSES INCREASES IN COSTS.

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:36.710
WHICH CAUSES US TO RUN OUT OF

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:37.878
MONEY THAT WE DON'T HAVE. TO

01:43:37.945 --> 01:43:39.513
BEGIN WITH.

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:40.681
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:43.784
COMPLICATED -- DISCUSSION HERE.

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:44.384
BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:45.252
BRIGHT MINDS.

01:43:45.319 --> 01:43:47.454
IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT CAN SIT

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:49.423
DOWN AND HAVE A SYSTEMATIC

01:43:49.489 --> 01:43:51.158
LOGICAL DISCUSSION AND ACTUALLY

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:53.226
PUT THIS TOGETHER.

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:54.695
ON A FROM A BIG HOLISTIC PICTURE.

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:56.196
AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU COULD

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:58.865
CONSIDER IT CONCEPTUALLY IS IF

01:43:58.932 --> 01:43:59.866
YOU'RE UNDERTAKING A LARGE

01:43:59.933 --> 01:44:01.301
PROJECT IN YOU NEED KIND OF A

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:02.502
BIG UP FRONT AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:44:02.569 --> 01:44:03.804
WHICH USUALLY IS WHAT WE AS

01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:04.972
BONDS.

01:44:05.038 --> 01:44:06.373
FOR THEN PAIRING IT WITH AN

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.241
ONGOING STREAM THAT COULD LOOK

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:09.176
AT SOME OF THAT NOT ONLY THE

01:44:09.242 --> 01:44:10.143
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BUT

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.378
ALSO SOME OF THE SCIENTIFIC

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:12.779
MONITORING AND THINKING ABOUT

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:15.015
THOSE KIND OF IN COMBINATION.

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:16.984
IF WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A FUN

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:19.486
SOURCE WHICH KEEPS US IN CHECK

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:19.953
SO THAT WE DON'T GET.

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:25.058
BEHIND AS WE ARE CURRENTLY TODAY.

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:28.895
THANK YOU MISTER GELLER.

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:31.031
SO I I KNOW SO WE WE CAN

01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:32.499
OUTLINED SEVERAL DIFFERENT.

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:36.570
TYPES OF FUNDING SOURCES -- ONE

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:37.304
ONE THAT I WAS BEEN THINKING

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:39.172
ABOUT IS WHAT IF WE DID ALLOW

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:41.975
LOCALS TO KEEP MORE OF THEIR

01:44:42.042 --> 01:44:44.645
SALES TAX -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

01:44:44.711 --> 01:44:46.780
IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT CONCEPT

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:48.348
BUT MAYBE IN ADDITION TO SOME OF

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:49.516
THESE OTHER THINGS THAT COULD BE

01:44:49.583 --> 01:44:51.518
ANOTHER.

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:54.821
WAY TO HELP FUND SOME OF THESE.

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.256
MANY OF THEM ARE YOU USUALLY

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:58.025
LOCALLY FOCUSED ALTHOUGH THEY DO

01:44:58.091 --> 01:44:58.725
HAVE.

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:01.862
A STATEWIDE IMPACTS AS WE NOW.

01:45:01.928 --> 01:45:03.363
BUT THAT MIGHT AT LEAST ALLOW

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:04.264
THEM TO KIND OF KEEP SOME OF

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:05.532
THEIR OWN MONEY THAT'S BEING

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:06.566
GENERATED LOCALLY AND PUT INTO

01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:08.068
THESE PROJECTS IS THAT SOMETHING

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:09.703
THAT WAS ANALYZE IT ALL WE

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:10.771
HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THAT I MEAN

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:11.872
OBVIOUSLY IF IT'S SPENDING

01:45:11.938 --> 01:45:13.440
THAT'S COMING TO THE STATE NOW

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:13.807
AND IT.

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:15.876
STOPS COMING TO THE STATE IT

01:45:15.942 --> 01:45:17.044
WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:18.278
STATE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:20.213
CURRENTLY RELYING ON IT BUT

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:22.249
CERTAINLY THERE ARE NUMEROUS

01:45:22.315 --> 01:45:23.817
OPTIONS.

01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:25.986
UP FOR REVENUE STREAMS AND AND

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:27.554
AGAIN I THINK WE WOULD SUGGEST

01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:28.722
THINKING ABOUT.

01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:31.224
THE STATEWIDE VERSUS LOCAL NEXUS

01:45:31.291 --> 01:45:33.727
IS PROBABLY A ONE HELPFUL TOOL

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:35.328
YOU COULD USE AS A WEIGHING

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:43.603
THOSE OPTIONS.

01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:46.006
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:47.507

01:45:47.574 --> 01:45:50.610
STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE.

FOR OUR PURPOSES OF INFORMING.

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:54.448
A PROCESS OR THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:57.851
GENERAL ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT

01:45:57.918 --> 01:45:58.452
ISSUES THANK YOU.

PANEL TO COME UP.

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:02.923
I THINK THAT THAT TAKE A FEW

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:04.624
MINUTES TO SET UP BY A POWER

01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:05.992
POINT THOUGH FOR BOARD

01:46:06.059 --> 01:46:10.297

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:42.896
WATER CHALLENGES IN STATE THIS

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:44.864
IS THIS IS REALLY GROUND ZERO IN

01:51:44.931 --> 01:51:47.600
IN IN A LOTTA RESPECTS -- FOR

01:51:47.667 --> 01:51:49.269
ADDRESSING MANY OF THE THINGS

01:51:49.335 --> 01:51:51.538
THAT ARE THAT ARE BECOMING THE

01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:53.239
IN FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE --

01:51:53.306 --> 01:51:54.741
THIS YEAR THIS IS THE STATE'S

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:56.876
LARGEST FARMING REGION OVER HALF

01:51:56.943 --> 01:51:59.412
OF OF ALL -- FARM GATE REVENUES

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.081
ARE ARE FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:03.016
VALLEY THE EIGHT VALLEY COUNTIES.

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:04.984
A LOT IS AT STAKE IN TERMS OF

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:07.220
ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:09.522
WATER SUPPLY AND WATER QUALITY

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:11.291
FOR THE REGION'S ECONOMY FOR

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:11.758
PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE

01:52:11.825 --> 01:52:14.627
ENVIRONMENT -- AND WE FIND THAT

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:15.929
THE MOST PROMISING APPROACHES

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.697
OUR APPROACH IS THAT REALLY HELP

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:20.400
INCREASE FLEXIBILITY.

01:52:20.467 --> 01:52:22.235
TO MANAGE THE WATER AS AS AS

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:23.870
BEST AS POSSIBLE PROVIDE

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:24.938
INCENTIVES ESPECIALLY TO

01:52:25.004 --> 01:52:26.339
LANDOWNERS IN GROWERS WHO ARE

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:27.207
GOING TO BE.

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:29.242
ON THIS SORT OF FRONT LINE IN

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:31.077
TERMS OF OF MANAGING THE

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:31.578
SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER

01:52:31.644 --> 01:52:32.445
MANAGEMENT.

01:52:32.512 --> 01:52:34.581
ACT IMPLICATIONS APPROACHES THAT

01:52:34.647 --> 01:52:36.483
LEVERAGE MULTIPLE BENEFITS THE

01:52:36.549 --> 01:52:38.451
TRY TO KIND OF STACKED STACKED

01:52:38.518 --> 01:52:41.454
DIFFERENT BENEFITS WITH WITH --

01:52:41.521 --> 01:52:42.522
ONE YOU KNOW ONE ONE KIND OF

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:44.057
INVESTMENT ARE ARE GOING TO BE

01:52:44.124 --> 01:52:45.391
MORE MORE IMPORTANT AND WE'LL

01:52:45.458 --> 01:52:46.126
TALK ABOUT A FEW EXAMPLES OF

01:52:46.192 --> 01:52:46.759
THAT.

01:52:46.826 --> 01:52:48.495
AND THEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:50.497
ABOUT IS THAT THIS IS REALLY

01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:51.297
SOMETHING AS SOMETHING

01:52:51.364 --> 01:52:56.069
FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESSING THESE

01:52:56.136 --> 01:52:56.669
CHALLENGES GOING TO HAVE TO BE

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:57.303
LED BY.

01:52:57.370 --> 01:52:57.937
FOLKS IN THE REGION ARE AT THE

01:52:58.004 --> 01:52:58.771
LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL AND

01:52:58.838 --> 01:53:00.373
THEY'RE GOING TO DO BEST WITH

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.908
COOPERATION AND COORDINATION.

01:53:01.975 --> 01:53:03.109
BUT THAT THE STATE AND FEDERAL

01:53:03.176 --> 01:53:04.310
GOVERNMENTS CAN BE REALLY REALLY

01:53:04.377 --> 01:53:05.745
KEEP PARTICIPANTS SO WE'RE GONNA

01:53:05.812 --> 01:53:06.946
TRY TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE OF

01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:08.815
WHERE IN PARTICULAR THE STATE

01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:10.950
CAN BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL.

01:53:11.017 --> 01:53:14.420
SO -- BIG CHALLENGES ARE WHAT

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:15.722
ONE OF THEM IS WATER SUPPLY AND

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:19.659
THIS IS A MAP OF THE OUT BASINS

01:53:19.726 --> 01:53:21.294
THAT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:22.328
SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER

01:53:22.395 --> 01:53:22.829
MANAGEMENT ACT.

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:25.398
AND DEVELOP PLANS TO ADDRESS

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:26.833
GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.735
EVERY BASE AND THAT'S SHOWN UP

01:53:28.801 --> 01:53:32.405
THERE IN AN ORANGE OR IN YELLOW --

01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:34.140
IS CONSIDERED PRIORITY AND HAVE

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:36.643
HAS TO A REPLY THAT THE RESPONSE

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:39.345
TO THIS -- THE VALLEY IS MOSTLY

01:53:39.412 --> 01:53:40.980
IN ORANGE THERE YOU CAN SEE AND

01:53:41.047 --> 01:53:42.982
THAT'S BECAUSE ALL MOST OF THESE

01:53:43.049 --> 01:53:44.317
BASES ARE CONSIDERED CRITICALLY

01:53:44.384 --> 01:53:45.652
OVER DRAFTED BY THE DEPARTMENT

01:53:45.718 --> 01:53:47.453
WATER RESOURCES WE ESTIMATE THAT.

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.689
THE LONG TERM DEFICIT IS ABOUT

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:51.157
TWO MILLION ACRE FEET A YEAR ARM

01:53:51.224 --> 01:53:54.260
WHICH CORRESPONDS TO ABOUT 11%

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:56.196
OF NET WATER USE IN THE IN THE

01:53:56.262 --> 01:53:58.531
WHOLE BASE AND THERE ARE A LOT

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:00.166
OF CONSEQUENCES OF THIS THAT ARE

01:54:00.233 --> 01:54:03.703
THAT ARE -- IMPACTING.

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:04.704
CREATING HARM IN THE VALLEY DR

01:54:04.771 --> 01:54:05.905
WELLS BOTH DRINKING WATER AND

01:54:05.972 --> 01:54:07.240
IRRIGATION WELLS WE SAW THIS A

01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:08.308
LOT DURING THE LAST ROUTE

01:54:08.374 --> 01:54:10.677
SINKING LANDS WHICH IS AFFECTING

01:54:10.743 --> 01:54:11.878
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:12.912
A LOT OF THE BIG CONVEYANCE

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.247
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO FLOOD

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:16.182
CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN

01:54:16.249 --> 01:54:17.750
JUST READ CONCERN ABOUT REDUCE

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:19.219
SUPPLIES FOR FUTURE DROUGHTS

01:54:19.285 --> 01:54:20.253
BECAUSE GROUNDWATER IS IT IS A

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.654
GREAT DROUGHT RESERVE WHEN THE

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:22.822
SURFACE WATER.

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:24.657
IS NOT AS A PLANET FULL

01:54:24.724 --> 01:54:25.625
GROUNDWATER REALLY COMES IN

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:27.927
HANDY NOW THE VALLEYS ON A FAST

01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:30.496
TRACK OF FOR IMPLEMENTING SIGMA

01:54:30.563 --> 01:54:32.098
BECAUSE THE THE CRITICALLY OVER

01:54:32.165 --> 01:54:33.466
DRAFTED BASINS ARE THE ONES THAT

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:35.268
HAVE TO GET THEIR PLANS IN FIRST.

01:54:35.335 --> 01:54:37.437
THOSE PLANS ARE DUE IN TWO OF

01:54:37.503 --> 01:54:39.038
THE PART OF WATER RESOURCES IN

01:54:39.105 --> 01:54:40.573
JANUARY.

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:43.076
TWENTY TWENTY AND BASICALLY THE

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:44.444
TWENTY TWENTY YOUR TIME LINE TO

01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:45.678
TO IMPLEMENT AND ATTAIN

01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:47.914
SUSTAINABILITY -- AND THE MASS

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:51.217
OF THIS IS IS A SIMPLE IN A WAY

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:52.518
THE SOLUTIONS ARE TOUGH BUT THE

01:54:52.585 --> 01:54:54.120
MATH IS SIMPLE IF YOU'RE IN AN

01:54:54.187 --> 01:54:55.455
OVERDRAFT BASIN.

01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:57.690
YOU'VE GOT TO EITHER FIND MORE

01:54:57.757 --> 01:54:59.025
WATER ADD SUPPLY.

01:54:59.092 --> 01:55:02.095
OF OR USE LESS OR PROBABLY IN A

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:03.196
LOT OF THESE BASE IN SOME

01:55:03.263 --> 01:55:05.465
COMBINATION AND SO -- THIS IS

01:55:05.531 --> 01:55:06.833
GOING TO CAUSE SOME SHORT TERM

01:55:06.899 --> 01:55:09.269
COSTS EVEN THOUGH THE LONG TERM

01:55:09.335 --> 01:55:10.870
IMPLEMENTATION OF CIGNA IS GOING

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:12.171
TO BE GOOD FOR THIS REGION

01:55:12.238 --> 01:55:13.873
BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE READ THE

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.775
RESOURCE WILL BE THERE. FOR FOR

01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:18.111
THE GENERATIONS TO COME AND SO

01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:20.446
WE LOOKED AT HOW TO DO THIS IN A

01:55:20.513 --> 01:55:22.148
WAY THAT COULD BE.

01:55:22.215 --> 01:55:24.083
A LEASE PAINFUL AND AND MOST

01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:29.589
BENEFICIAL SO THAT'S THE SUPPLY

01:55:29.656 --> 01:55:31.157
SIDE NOW.

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:31.924
THE SUPPLIES THAT HAS TO BE

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:33.059
MATCHED WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING ON

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:33.760
THE QUALITY SIDE AND EVEN.

01:55:33.826 --> 01:55:34.594
THOUGHT I KNOW TALKING A LOT

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:35.895
ABOUT THE SAFE DRINKING WATER --

01:55:35.962 --> 01:55:37.430
CHALLENGE THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE

01:55:37.497 --> 01:55:39.065
IN THIS VALLEY TO SHOW YOU A

01:55:39.132 --> 01:55:40.933
COUPLE MAPS OF THAT IN A MOMENT --

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.902
BUT THEY'RE ALSO JUST LONG TERM

01:55:42.969 --> 01:55:45.538
ISSUES OF AND WE WE WE'RE WE'RE%

01:55:45.605 --> 01:55:46.873
ARGUING THAT PROVIDING SAFE

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:49.475
DRINKING WATER JUST AN URGENT

01:55:49.542 --> 01:55:50.777
THING THAT WE JUST HAVE TO DO.

01:55:50.843 --> 01:55:52.612
PRONTO ARM AND THEN BUT THEY'RE

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:54.514
ALSO LONGER TERM WATER QUALITY

01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:55.748
MANAGEMENT ISSUES INCLUDING

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:57.183
NITROGEN LOADING WHICH IS A YOU

01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:58.217
KNOW AN ISSUE IN ANY

01:55:58.284 --> 01:55:59.452
AGRICULTURAL AREA.

01:55:59.519 --> 01:56:00.820
OF THEIR SOME NITROGEN THAT THAT

01:56:00.887 --> 01:56:02.722
CONTRIBUTES TO THE TO THE GROUND

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:04.624
WATER AND IN PARTS OF THE VALLEY

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:06.526
IT'S VERY VERY HIGH -- AND

01:56:06.592 --> 01:56:08.294
CAUSES CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:09.862
WATER AND THEN MANAGING LONG

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:11.431
TERM SALT BALANCE WHICH IS AN

01:56:11.497 --> 01:56:11.898
ISSUE FOR AGRICULTURAL

01:56:11.964 --> 01:56:12.865
PRODUCTIVITY.

01:56:12.932 --> 01:56:15.134
SO THERE ARE POTENTIAL SYNERGIES

01:56:15.201 --> 01:56:18.004
IN MANAGING OF FIRST OF SUPPLY

01:56:18.071 --> 01:56:20.306
GROUND WATER BALANCE AND AND FOR

01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:21.841
MANAGING QUALITY BUT THEY'RE

01:56:21.908 --> 01:56:23.142
ALSO SOME POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS.

01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:24.010
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:56:24.077 --> 01:56:27.380
RECHARGING GROUNDWATER WE'LL

01:56:27.447 --> 01:56:27.947
TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT

01:56:28.014 --> 01:56:28.348
MORE IN A MOMENT.

01:56:28.414 --> 01:56:29.649
AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE THAT WE

01:56:29.716 --> 01:56:30.717
HIGHLIGHT OUR THE AS REALLY

01:56:30.783 --> 01:56:32.318
FORTHCOMING AND TALK ABOUT

01:56:32.385 --> 01:56:33.386
DRINKING WATER QUALITY IN THE

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:34.687
LONG TERM WATER QUALITY AS

01:56:34.754 --> 01:56:36.756
SEPARATE ISSUES -- IN TERMS OF

01:56:36.823 --> 01:56:38.324
POLICY SOLUTIONS THE FOURTH KIND

01:56:38.391 --> 01:56:40.159
OF AREA WE'RE WE'RE GONNA

01:56:40.226 --> 01:56:40.793
HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU A LITTLE BIT

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.995
IS THE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW

01:56:43.062 --> 01:56:44.964
YOU GET BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE IN

01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:46.399
NATURE IN THE MIDST OF THIS

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:48.434
TRANSITION ESPECIALLY.

01:56:48.501 --> 01:56:51.304
WHEN -- RECOGNIZING THAT SOME

01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:51.904
LAND IS LIKELY TO COME OUT OF

01:56:51.971 --> 01:56:53.806
PRODUCTION AS PART OF DEMAND

01:56:53.873 --> 01:56:54.907
MANAGEMENT.

01:56:54.974 --> 01:56:57.744
IN THE VALLEY AND THERE'S A LOT

01:56:57.810 --> 01:57:00.213
OF CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THIS COULD

01:57:00.279 --> 01:57:02.415
MEAN IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL DUST

01:57:02.482 --> 01:57:04.884
ADDITIONAL PASS ADDITIONAL WEEDS

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.753
ARE BAD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BAD

01:57:06.819 --> 01:57:08.988
FOR NEIGHBORING FARMS -- AND SO

01:57:09.055 --> 01:57:11.023
INTEREST IT VERY EARLY DAYS OF

01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:13.025
INTEREST IN LOOKING AT HOW DO WE

01:57:13.092 --> 01:57:15.161
MANAGE THAT THOSE DECISIONS IN

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:16.496
WAYS THAT ARE.

01:57:16.562 --> 01:57:18.064
ARE GOING TO BE AS BENEFICIAL AS

01:57:18.131 --> 01:57:19.499
POSSIBLE AND AND PROVIDE AS MUCH

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:21.834
VALUE TO THE VALLEY SO LOOKING

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:23.269
FOR MULTI BENEFIT APPROACHES

01:57:23.336 --> 01:57:25.304
HEALTHY SOILS MANAGEMENT WHICH

01:57:25.371 --> 01:57:27.240
COULD GENERATE CREDITS FOR FOR

01:57:27.306 --> 01:57:30.109
CARBON CAPTURE -- HABITAT OF

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:31.577
SOLAR INCLUDING WILDLIFE

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:34.380
FRIENDLYSOLAR RECHARGE CAN BE

01:57:34.447 --> 01:57:36.215
AN IMPORTANT THING TO TO LOOK AT

01:57:36.282 --> 01:57:37.784
IN SOME PLACES FLOOD PROTECTION

01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:39.952
RECREATION THESE ARE ALL THINGS

01:57:40.019 --> 01:57:40.920
TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:44.390
MANAGING MANAGING LAND AND WATER

01:57:44.457 --> 01:57:45.191
RESOURCES.

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:45.725
SO I'M GOING TO JUST WALK

01:57:45.792 --> 01:57:46.926
THROUGH FOR YOU.

01:57:46.993 --> 01:57:48.628
THESE FOUR AREA FOR PRIORITY

01:57:48.694 --> 01:57:49.962
AREAS FOR ACTION.

01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:53.499
AND A LITTLE BIT OF KIND OF SOME

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:55.501
OF THE SOME OF THE KEY AREAS IN

01:57:55.568 --> 01:57:56.102
NEED IN EACH OF THESE HAT WE

01:57:56.169 --> 01:57:56.936
THINK.

01:57:57.003 --> 01:57:58.371
KIND OF NEAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN

01:57:58.438 --> 01:58:00.506
ORDER FOR FOR SICK FOR SUCCESS

01:58:00.573 --> 01:58:01.774
THE FIRST IS BALANCING WATER

01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:03.309
SUPPLIES AND DEMANDS SO THIS IS

01:58:03.376 --> 01:58:04.777
THIS ISSUE OF ADDRESSING THE

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:06.446
LONG TERM GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT.

01:58:06.512 --> 01:58:08.514
AND WE LOOKED IN THIS STUDY AT

01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:09.415
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT

01:58:09.482 --> 01:58:11.551
ANYBODY HAD EVER COME OUT WITH A

01:58:11.617 --> 01:58:13.686
REPORT ABOUT OR ANALYSIS ABOUT

01:58:13.753 --> 01:58:15.421
IN TERMS OF SUPPLY OPTIONS.

01:58:15.488 --> 01:58:16.956
WE LOOKED AT THOSE TO SEE HOW

01:58:17.023 --> 01:58:17.824
MUCH WATER COULD BE MADE

01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:20.193
AVAILABLE IN THE VALLEY FROM

01:58:20.259 --> 01:58:20.860
THAT BUT ALSO HOW MUCH WOULD IT

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:22.962
COST BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE IN

01:58:23.029 --> 01:58:24.363
PARTICULAR HOW MUCH OF THIS

01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:25.798
COULD BE AFFORDED.

01:58:25.865 --> 01:58:27.567
BY FARMERS WHO WILL BE THE THE

01:58:27.633 --> 01:58:30.369
PRINCIPAL FOLKS AFFECTED BY BY

01:58:30.436 --> 01:58:31.737
MANAGING.

01:58:31.804 --> 01:58:33.439
SIGMA JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE THE

01:58:33.506 --> 01:58:34.774
THE MAIN WATER USERS IT'S A IT'S

01:58:34.841 --> 01:58:36.142
A BIG BIG SECTOR IN THE VALLEY

01:58:36.209 --> 01:58:37.877
YOUR GATED AGRICULTURE WE ALSO

01:58:37.944 --> 01:58:38.911
LOOKED AT THE MAN MANAGEMENT

01:58:38.978 --> 01:58:41.247
OPTIONS BOTH FOR AGRICULTURE BUT

01:58:41.314 --> 01:58:44.550
ALSO IN THE URBAN SECTOR -- AS

01:58:44.617 --> 01:58:45.751
WELL AS WAYS TO INCREASE

01:58:45.818 --> 01:58:47.954
FLEXIBILITY AND JUST THE THE

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:49.856
IDEA DOES THAT I'M GOING TO TALK

01:58:49.922 --> 01:58:50.823
ABOUT WHEN I WHEN I SHOW YOU

01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:52.258
NEXT GRAPH IS.

01:58:52.325 --> 01:58:54.393
THINKING ABOUT THAT THAT READ

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:55.995
PART OF THAT DOUGHNUT THERE THE

01:58:56.062 --> 01:58:57.864
GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT FEES --

01:58:57.930 --> 01:58:59.699
EITHER YOU GOTTA FIND SUPPLIES

01:58:59.765 --> 01:59:00.800
TO FILL THAT.

01:59:00.867 --> 01:59:03.002
OR YOU'VE GOT TO REDUCE THE

01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:04.904
DONUTS. TO TO TO SHRINK THAT

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:07.707
OVER TIME UNDER SIGMA.

01:59:07.773 --> 01:59:09.375
AND SO THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:10.743
OF WHAT WE FIND ON THE SUPPLY

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:12.545
SIDE THIS IS LOOKING AT A WHOLE

01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:13.946
LOT OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS

01:59:14.013 --> 01:59:15.848
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS BOTH BIG

01:59:15.915 --> 01:59:16.582
AND SMALL.

01:59:16.649 --> 01:59:19.051
ARM IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THE

01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:21.320
BLUE BARS TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH

01:59:21.387 --> 01:59:23.055
WATER PHYSICALLY COULD BE

01:59:23.122 --> 01:59:25.024
AVAILABLE POTENTIALLY AT THE YOU

01:59:25.091 --> 01:59:26.292
KNOW THE MAXIMUM POTENTIALLY

01:59:26.359 --> 01:59:29.262
AVAILABLE ON AN ANNUAL AVERAGE.

01:59:29.328 --> 01:59:31.297
OF FROM FROM THESE FROM THESE

01:59:31.364 --> 01:59:32.932
DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND THE

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:35.434
YELLOW IS THE IS THE PORTION

01:59:35.501 --> 01:59:37.470
THAT WE THINK OF IT FARMERS ARE

01:59:37.537 --> 01:59:39.572
LIKELY TO BE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:59:39.639 --> 01:59:42.375
AFFORD AND AND WILLING TO PAY --

01:59:42.441 --> 01:59:44.544
FOR RATHER THAN WRAP IT IN IN

01:59:44.610 --> 01:59:46.412
THE IT ISSUE BEING IF IT'S MORE

01:59:46.479 --> 01:59:47.847
COSTLY THAN THAT.

01:59:47.914 --> 01:59:48.681
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE MAKING

01:59:48.748 --> 01:59:50.082
ENOUGH MONEY IN THERE FOR IN

01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:51.350
THEIR FARMING FROM IT AND SO

01:59:51.417 --> 01:59:52.585
THEY WOULD THEY WOULD NOT BE AS

01:59:52.652 --> 01:59:53.986
INTERESTED IN INVESTING.

01:59:54.053 --> 01:59:55.321
IN YOU STARTING TO SEE THE THESE

01:59:55.388 --> 01:59:56.822
CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING ACROSS

01:59:56.889 --> 01:59:58.824
THE VALLEY IN TERMS OF WHAT.

01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.159
OF WHAT FOLKS ARE WILLING TO

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:01.727
INVEST IN SO I'LL JUST WALK YOU

02:00:01.794 --> 02:00:03.095
THROUGH REALLY QUICKLY KIND OF

02:00:03.162 --> 02:00:05.264
WHAT THE WHAT THE BIG.

02:00:05.331 --> 02:00:07.700
THE BIG CATEGORIES ARE CAPTURING

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:09.001
AND STORING MORE MORE LOCAL RUN

02:00:09.068 --> 02:00:11.337
OFF THIS IS THIS KEY ISSUE OF

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:13.506
WINTER AND SPRING FLOOD FLOWS

02:00:13.573 --> 02:00:15.207
SOME OF IT IS NOT.

02:00:15.274 --> 02:00:16.676
A REQUIRED FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

02:00:16.742 --> 02:00:18.144
SOME OF IT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:21.447
DOWNSTREAM WATER USERS -- CAN WE

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:22.014
CAPTURE MORE OF THAT AND GET

02:00:22.081 --> 02:00:23.049
THAT.

02:00:23.115 --> 02:00:24.517
INTO THE GROUND.

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:26.018
ESPECIALLY BUT YOU KNOW ALSO

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:27.687
ALSO WINS IN SURFACE RESERVOIRS

02:00:27.753 --> 02:00:29.822
WHAT WE FIND IS THAT THAT'S THE

02:00:29.889 --> 02:00:31.090
THAT'S THE BIGGEST.

02:00:31.157 --> 02:00:34.060
AFFORDABLE POT OF WATER -- ABOUT

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:35.695
21% OF THE OF THE DEFICIT COULD

02:00:35.761 --> 02:00:37.430
BE MET IN THAT WAY ESPECIALLY

02:00:37.496 --> 02:00:38.965
WITH GROUND WATER RECHARGE.

02:00:39.031 --> 02:00:40.499
THE SECOND BIG CATEGORY THERE IS

02:00:40.566 --> 02:00:42.001
INCREASING RUN OFF WITH UPPER

02:00:42.068 --> 02:00:43.302
WATERSHED MANAGEMENT.

02:00:43.369 --> 02:00:44.804
YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT'S A BIG

02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:46.205
BLUE BAR THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF

02:00:46.272 --> 02:00:47.473
POTENTIAL WATER UP THERE BUT

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:49.241
THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE IF YOU

02:00:49.308 --> 02:00:53.279
JUST ARE THINKING ABOUT AS

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:54.413
INVESTMENT FOR WATER ALONE.

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:55.748
THIS IS YOU KNOW MANAGING YOUR

02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:56.415
HAD WATER FOR US TO TO INCREASE

02:00:56.482 --> 02:00:56.682
RUN OFF.

02:00:56.749 --> 02:00:58.150
THE THIRD IS INCREASING DELTA

02:00:58.217 --> 02:00:59.518
IMPORTS AND THERE WE LOOKED AT

02:00:59.585 --> 02:01:01.153
CAL CALIFORNIA WATER FIX WE

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.321
LOOKED AT SITES RESERVOIR WE

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:03.556
LOOKED AT SHASTA.

02:01:03.623 --> 02:01:05.858
A VARIETY OF THINGS AND WHAT WE

02:01:05.925 --> 02:01:07.660
FIND IS THAT THERE'S MOST OF

02:01:07.727 --> 02:01:09.161
THOSE BIG PROJECTS ARE KIND OF

02:01:09.228 --> 02:01:10.730
EXPENSIVE ON A PER ACRE FOOT

02:01:10.796 --> 02:01:12.098
BASES FOR FARMERS.

02:01:12.164 --> 02:01:13.833
AND WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVEN'T YET

02:01:13.899 --> 02:01:15.935
SEEN MANY PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:17.336
THAT IN THE VALLEY EITHER SO

02:01:17.403 --> 02:01:19.505
THAT WE DO THINK THOUGH THERE'S

02:01:19.572 --> 02:01:21.007
SOME COST EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL.

02:01:21.073 --> 02:01:22.675
TO MANAGE THE WHOLE SYSTEM IN A

02:01:22.742 --> 02:01:24.710
MORE COORDINATED FASHION AND AND

02:01:24.777 --> 02:01:26.178
GET SOME GET SOME GET SOME

02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:27.380
ADDITIONAL WATER OUT OF THAT THE

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:29.081
OTHER THE OTHER CATEGORIES ARE

02:01:29.148 --> 02:01:30.383
PRETTY SMALL IN THE INTEREST OF

02:01:30.449 --> 02:01:32.451
TIME ALL OF SKIP OVER THOSE BUT

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:33.019
WE CAN COME BACK IF YOU HAVE

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:33.886
QUESTIONS.

02:01:33.953 --> 02:01:35.855
SO THINK ABOUT THIS AS ABOUT A

02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:37.790
QUARTER OF THE DEFICIT CAN BE

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:39.859
MET WITH AFFORDABLE NEW NEW

02:01:39.925 --> 02:01:41.994
SUPPLIES THAT MEANS THAT ABOUT

02:01:42.061 --> 02:01:43.529
THREE QUARTERS OF THE DEFICIT

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:44.897
HAS TO BE MET THROUGH DEMAND

02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:46.198
MANAGEMENT OR WILL LIKELY HAVE

02:01:46.265 --> 02:01:46.732
TO BE MET THROUGH DEMAND

02:01:46.799 --> 02:01:47.733
MANAGEMENT.

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.602
AND THE MAIN WAY THAT THIS CAN

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:51.704
HAPPEN IS WITH SOMEWHAT WITH

02:01:51.771 --> 02:01:53.172
CROP SHIFTING BUT ESPECIALLY

02:01:53.239 --> 02:01:54.674
WITH TAKING SOME LAND OUT OF

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:55.641
PRODUCTION.

02:01:55.708 --> 02:01:57.376
ARM AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:01:57.443 --> 02:01:58.911
GAY ASIAN EFFICIENCY DOES NOT

02:01:58.978 --> 02:02:00.446
REALLY GET YOU MUCH IN THE WAY

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:01.914
OF NET WATER SAVINGS WHICH IS

02:02:01.981 --> 02:02:03.249
WHAT YOU NEED. FOR BASE AND

02:02:03.315 --> 02:02:04.884
BALANCING YOUR CATION EFFICIENCY

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:05.384
HAS ALL KINDS OF OTHER

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:07.687
ADVANTAGES BUT IT'S NOT A GREAT

02:02:07.753 --> 02:02:08.888
STIGMA TOOL.

02:02:08.954 --> 02:02:10.823
SO WHAT THESE LITTLE BAR SHOW

02:02:10.890 --> 02:02:13.759
YOU IS JUST A COMPARISON OF HOW

02:02:13.826 --> 02:02:14.927
TO MANAGE.

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:18.431
THAT DEMAND IN WITH.

02:02:18.497 --> 02:02:19.832
INFLEXIBLE OR FLEXIBLE WATER.

02:02:19.899 --> 02:02:22.101
USE AND THE THE MOST INFLEXIBLE

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:24.136
INFLEXIBLE BAR THAT GRAYBAR AS

02:02:24.203 --> 02:02:25.771
ARE THE I GUESS IT'S BROWN --

02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:28.741
THAT IS IF BASICALLY FARMERS IN

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:30.876
A BASIN THAT HAS LET'S SAY 25%

02:02:30.943 --> 02:02:32.578
OVER DRAFT WHICH IS KIND OF WHAT

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:33.179
THEY'RE ESTIMATING ROUGHLY IN

02:02:33.245 --> 02:02:34.213
KERN.

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:35.581
ARM IF EVERYBODY JUST HAS TO CUT

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:38.451
EVERY CROP BY EXACTLY 25%.

02:02:38.517 --> 02:02:39.819
YOU DON'T MAKING CHOICES OF OKAY

02:02:39.885 --> 02:02:42.288
I'M GOING TO LEAVE MORE WATER

02:02:42.354 --> 02:02:43.956
FOR A MORE PROFITABLE CROP AND

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:45.925
LESS FOR ANOTHER -- THAT IS THAT

02:02:45.991 --> 02:02:47.660
THAT'S THE MOST COSTLY BY FAR

02:02:47.727 --> 02:02:49.161
AND WE ESTIMATE YOUR RELATIVE TO

02:02:49.228 --> 02:02:50.596
CUT CURRENT CONDITIONS THAT

02:02:50.663 --> 02:02:51.530
WOULD COST ABOUT.

02:02:51.597 --> 02:02:55.034
A LOSS OF REVENUES OF ABOUT

02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:56.001
THREE POINT FIVE BILLION.

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:57.269
DOLLARS A YEAR IF YOU JUMP TO

02:02:57.336 --> 02:02:59.672
THE NEXT -- THE ORANGE THERE

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:01.474
THAT IS A MATTER OF ALLOWING FOR

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:03.375
LOCAL WATER TRADING FLEXIBLE

02:03:03.442 --> 02:03:05.044
WATER USE BOTH SURFACE WATER AND

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:06.445
GROUNDWATER WITHIN THE BASINS

02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:08.047
WITHIN THE GROUNDWATER BASIN SO

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:11.317
LOCALLY -- THAT CUTS THE REVENUE

02:03:11.383 --> 02:03:12.651
LOSSES ALMOST IN HALF.

02:03:12.718 --> 02:03:15.287
JUST BY GIVING THAT FLEXIBILITY

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:16.455
TO TO TO USE THE WATER WHERE IT

02:03:16.522 --> 02:03:17.923
IT'S BRINGING IN THE THE MOST

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.824
REVENUES.

02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:20.860
ON PROFITS -- AND THEN THE THE

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:23.229
OR THE YELLOW IS WHEN YOU ALSO

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:25.197
HAVE VALLEY WHY TRADING WITHIN

02:03:25.264 --> 02:03:26.699
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY SAME

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:28.534
WATER BUDGET BUT JUST ALLOWING

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:30.302
SURFACE WATER TO MOVE AROUND.

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:31.771
FROM SOME OF THE BASINS THAT

02:03:31.837 --> 02:03:33.372
DON'T HAVE A BIG OVERDRAFT

02:03:33.439 --> 02:03:35.407
PROBLEM TO THE TO SOME THAT DO.

02:03:35.474 --> 02:03:36.842
AND THEN THE BLUE IS KIND OF THE

02:03:36.909 --> 02:03:37.710
OF IT ARE NOW SAYS THE SWEET

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:39.278
SPOT THAT'S THE COMBINATION OF

02:03:39.345 --> 02:03:41.347
THE FLEXIBLE WATER MANAGEMENT

02:03:41.413 --> 02:03:42.314
ALONG WITH THOSE SUPPLY

02:03:42.381 --> 02:03:43.616
INVESTMENTS AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE

02:03:43.682 --> 02:03:44.784
IS THAT THAT.

02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:46.285
BRINGS THE THE REVENUE LOSSES

02:03:46.352 --> 02:03:47.553
DOWN THERE ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:48.687
OF WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:50.856
WITH INFLEXIBLE WATER USE AND NO

02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:52.291
SUPPLY INVESTMENTS.

02:03:52.358 --> 02:03:53.926
THAT'S ALSO THE ONE THAT REALLY

02:03:53.993 --> 02:03:55.561
REDUCES LAND FOLLOWING BECAUSE

02:03:55.628 --> 02:03:57.229
THAT JUST MEANS MORE WATER IS

02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:59.498
AVAILABLE TO APPLY.

02:03:59.565 --> 02:04:01.033
TO TO THE CROP SO THE ESTIMATES

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:02.668
THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FROM OUR

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:04.136
STUDY OF AT LEAST HALF A MILLION

02:04:04.203 --> 02:04:05.938
ACRES THAT WE ANTICIPATE MAY

02:04:06.005 --> 02:04:07.273
NEED TO GO OUT OF CROP OF YOUR

02:04:07.339 --> 02:04:08.040
GATED.

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:09.608
CROP PRODUCTION THAT'S THAT BLUE

02:04:09.675 --> 02:04:12.344
BAR IT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:13.112
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES IF

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:14.513
THERE'S NOT NEW SUPPLIES WERE

02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:17.616
LOOKING MORE LIKE.

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:18.250
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SO

02:04:18.317 --> 02:04:20.186
THE OTHER -- THING TO NOTE IS

02:04:20.252 --> 02:04:22.421
THAT THESE THINGS THESE MORE

02:04:22.488 --> 02:04:23.956
FLEXIBLE STRATEGIES AND THE NEW

02:04:24.023 --> 02:04:26.592
SUPPLIES -- YOU COMBINE THOSE

02:04:26.659 --> 02:04:28.794
THAT'S GOOD NOT ONLY FOR FARMERS

02:04:28.861 --> 02:04:30.696
IN IN TERMS OF CROP REVENUES IT

02:04:30.763 --> 02:04:32.097
ALSO IS IS GOOD FOR THE REGIONAL

02:04:32.164 --> 02:04:33.966
ECONOMY IN IN A MORE GENERAL WAY

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:35.501
WE LOOKED AT BOTH THAT BEEF AND

02:04:35.568 --> 02:04:37.036
AND DAIRY.

02:04:37.102 --> 02:04:39.071
AT DOWNSTREAM PROCESSING AND AND

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:40.406
KIND OF THE ECONOMICS OF THAT

02:04:40.472 --> 02:04:42.007
NOT JUST FROM THE FORMER

02:04:42.074 --> 02:04:43.609
PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM.

02:04:43.676 --> 02:04:46.111
REGIONAL A G. P. AND ALSO FOR IT

02:04:46.178 --> 02:04:48.147
FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE A JOBS

02:04:48.214 --> 02:04:50.249
IT'S JUST BETTER. TO TO KIND OF

02:04:50.316 --> 02:04:52.318
USE THIS PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO

02:04:52.384 --> 02:04:54.286
TO REDUCE THE COSTS THE OTHER

02:04:54.353 --> 02:04:56.522
KEY FLEXIBILITY TOOL THAT FOLKS

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:58.224
ARE IMAGINING OR ENVISAGING

02:04:58.290 --> 02:04:59.425
USING IN THE VALLEY IS WHAT

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:00.626
THEY'RE CALLING A GLIDE PATH.

02:05:00.693 --> 02:05:03.596
THIS IS THE IDEA THAT YOU DON'T.

02:05:03.662 --> 02:05:06.031
OVERNIGHT AND OVERDRAFT YOU TAKE

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:07.700
YOUR TWENTY YEARS TO AND

02:05:07.766 --> 02:05:09.001
GRADUALLY GET THERE THAT GIVES

02:05:09.068 --> 02:05:10.803
YOU MORE TIME TO ADAPT AND

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:12.071
ADJUST AND KIND OF DO PILOT

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:13.239
PROJECTS. TO TO SEE WHAT'S

02:05:13.305 --> 02:05:14.473
WORKING [inaudible]

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:17.877
SO -- PRIORITIES THIS IS KIND OF

02:05:17.943 --> 02:05:19.578
A A LIST OF THE OF THE DIFFERENT

02:05:19.645 --> 02:05:20.412
KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:23.182
TO MAKE THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND.

02:05:23.249 --> 02:05:25.284
A PORTFOLIO WORK THERE A LOT OF

02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:26.585
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THAT NEED

02:05:26.652 --> 02:05:28.420
TO HAPPEN WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED

02:05:28.487 --> 02:05:29.688
FOR YOU HERE THE ONES WITH STARS

02:05:29.755 --> 02:05:31.690
ARE WEIRD STATE AND FEDERAL

02:05:31.757 --> 02:05:33.225
ACTION ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT.

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:34.260
THAT'S IN HELPING TO ASSESS

02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:35.594
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WHERE ARE

02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:37.263
THE GOOD INVESTMENTS THAT'S KIND

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:38.631
OF ONE OF THE FOLLOW ONS TO THE

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:40.299
DISCUSSION YOU HAD ON FUNDING

02:05:40.366 --> 02:05:41.333
THIS MORNING IS HOW TO FIGURE

02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:42.001
OUT.

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:43.302
YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S THE LIST

02:05:43.369 --> 02:05:44.703
OF POTENTIAL PROJECTS IS WAY

02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:46.438
BIGGER THAN THAN THE MONEY NO

02:05:46.505 --> 02:05:48.941
MATTER WHAT YOU DO SO WHERE'S

02:05:49.008 --> 02:05:49.575
THE WHERE'S THE BEST BANG FOR

02:05:49.642 --> 02:05:51.477
THE BUCK -- NUMBER FOR

02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:52.778
CLARIFYING HOW MUCH WATER IS

02:05:52.845 --> 02:05:54.546
AVAILABLE FOR RECHARGE THIS KIND

02:05:54.613 --> 02:05:56.448
OF THE THE LEGAL QUESTION AND

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:58.751
THAT'S REALLY. ONE WHERE THE

02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:00.519
STATE NEEDS TO TO PLAY A VERY

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:02.254
IMPORTANT NEW LEADING ROLE AND

02:06:02.321 --> 02:06:03.989
THEN NUMBER FIVE IS FACILITATING

02:06:04.056 --> 02:06:05.157
APPROVALS FOR TRADING AND

02:06:05.224 --> 02:06:06.926
BANKING PROJECTS THAT'S USING

02:06:06.992 --> 02:06:08.460
STATE INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:12.231
FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE. TO TO

02:06:12.298 --> 02:06:13.499
MAKE SOME OF THESE.

02:06:13.565 --> 02:06:14.466
THESE DEALS HAPPEN -- AND THEN

02:06:14.533 --> 02:06:16.335
YOU KNOW IT WORKING WITH LOCALS

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:17.469
ON SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS I

02:06:17.536 --> 02:06:19.238
THINK TO THE HELP THAT HELP

02:06:19.305 --> 02:06:20.205
ENCOURAGE THEM TO DEVELOP THEIR

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:20.806
OWN.

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:22.708
THEIR OWN -- NCENTIVES AT THE

02:06:22.775 --> 02:06:24.343
LOCAL LEVEL.

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.378
SO NEXT IS INSURING SAFE AND

02:06:26.445 --> 02:06:28.414
RELIABLE DRINKINGWATER AND IF

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:30.582
THE VALLEY IS GROUND ZERO FOR

02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:31.984
GROUND WATER OVERDRAFT AND

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:32.484
SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:33.485
MANAGEMENT ACT.

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:35.421
IT'S ALSO GROUND ZERO FOR THE

02:06:35.487 --> 02:06:37.089
SAFE DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:38.958
CALIFORNIA AND WANT TO EMPHASIZE

02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:40.726
THAT THIS IS BOTH A QUALITY

02:06:40.793 --> 02:06:42.461
ISSUE AND A SUPPLY ISSUE I HEARD

02:06:42.528 --> 02:06:43.996
ABOUT YOU REPORTER BILL THIS

02:06:44.063 --> 02:06:45.364
MORNING.

02:06:45.431 --> 02:06:46.632
THAT'S ON THE SUPPLY SIDE THAT

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:49.969
THAT WOULD BE -- EIGHT A IS THE

02:06:50.035 --> 02:06:51.270
JUST LOOK A LOOK AT COMMUNITY

02:06:51.337 --> 02:06:53.672
WATER SYSTEMS THAT WERE OUT OF

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:55.741
COMPLIANCE WITH A VERY IS

02:06:55.808 --> 02:06:57.209
MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LIMITS THIS

02:06:57.276 --> 02:07:00.579
IS MATT FROM JULY OF LAST SUMMER --

02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:02.014
THERE WOULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:03.449
DOTS ON THERE FOR ONE TO THREE

02:07:03.515 --> 02:07:06.618
T. C. P. NOW AS WELL AND WHAT

02:07:06.685 --> 02:07:07.886
WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED THE THEY'RE

02:07:07.953 --> 02:07:09.421
THE EIGHT VALLEY COUNTIES.

02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:11.757
OVER HALF OF ALL THE SYSTEMS ARE

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:13.792
THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE ARE

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:15.361
ARE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

02:07:15.427 --> 02:07:17.229
AND MOST OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE

02:07:17.296 --> 02:07:18.530
SMALL AND MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:19.665
OUT OF COMPLIANCE FOR AT LEAST

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:21.333
THREE YEARS SO IT'S A IT'S NOT

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:22.835
JUST THE A BLIP KIND OF PROBLEM

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:24.470
WITH A CHRONIC PROBLEM.

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:26.105
AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT MATT B.

02:07:26.171 --> 02:07:27.806
THIS IS THE DAY THAT THE STATE

02:07:27.873 --> 02:07:29.608
COLLECTED DURING THE DROUGHT OF

02:07:29.675 --> 02:07:31.343
SYSTEMS MOSTLY SYSTEMS WAS

02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:32.911
SHALLOW WELLS THAT THAT WERE

02:07:32.978 --> 02:07:34.680
ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE.

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:36.081
TO A TWO GOING DRY WHEN THE

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:37.516
GROUND WATER LEVELS WERE FALLING

02:07:37.583 --> 02:07:39.818
THE THE BLUE IS THE HOUSEHOLD

02:07:39.885 --> 02:07:40.619
THAT REPORTED TO THE STATE

02:07:40.686 --> 02:07:43.122
WEBSITE ABOUT HAVING SHORTAGES

02:07:43.188 --> 02:07:44.957
WITH WITH THEIR DOMESTIC WELLS.

02:07:45.024 --> 02:07:47.359
AND THE ORANGE IS SMALL SAYS OR

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:49.228
SYSTEMS THAT REQUESTED EMERGENCY

02:07:49.294 --> 02:07:50.529
ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE

02:07:50.596 --> 02:07:52.297
COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS HALF OF

02:07:52.364 --> 02:07:53.932
THOSE COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS

02:07:53.999 --> 02:07:55.267
THAT HAVE SUPPLY SHORTAGES IN

02:07:55.334 --> 02:07:56.869
THE VALLEY AGAIN YOU KNOW

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:57.936
FAMILIAR PATTERN WE THINK THAT

02:07:58.003 --> 02:07:59.438
10% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION.

02:07:59.505 --> 02:08:01.774
HALF OF THE THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:04.610
IN TROUBLE AND THEN ALMOST 80%

02:08:04.676 --> 02:08:06.478
OF THE WELLS REPORTED DRY AND WE

02:08:06.545 --> 02:08:08.047
KNOW THIS IS AN UNDER REPORT

02:08:08.113 --> 02:08:09.248
BECAUSE IT WAS A JUST A

02:08:09.314 --> 02:08:11.483
VOLUNTARY THING WASN'T COLLECTED

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:11.984
EVERYWHERE.

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:14.253
UP OVER 80% IN THE VALLEY SO

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:20.125
THIS IS A THIS IS AN ISSUE

02:08:20.192 --> 02:08:20.793
THAT'S GOING TO BE.

02:08:20.859 --> 02:08:21.393
PERSISTENT IN FUTURE DROUGHTS

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:22.628
AND ALSO SOMETHING TO THINK

02:08:22.694 --> 02:08:24.196
ABOUT AND THE THE THE JEEP THE

02:08:24.263 --> 02:08:24.863
GROUNDWATER SENSIBILITY AGENCIES

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:25.531
WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AS THE

02:08:25.597 --> 02:08:26.832
IMPLEMENT A GLIDE PATH.

02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:28.033
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE GONNA ALLOW

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:30.502
SOME CONTINUED OVERDRAFT THEY'VE

02:08:30.569 --> 02:08:31.904
GOT TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THAT.

02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:35.240
SO HERE'S HERE THE TOP

02:08:35.307 --> 02:08:36.108
PRIORITIES AND SARGE IS GOING TO

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:38.444
BE IS IS IS IN THE TRENCHES ON

02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:40.245
THIS -- IT IN IT IN THE VALLEY

02:08:40.312 --> 02:08:41.447
AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE IS

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:42.681
GOING TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:44.616
THOUGHTS TO SHARE BUT THESE ARE

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:46.185
KIND OF SOME TOP PRIORITIES.

02:08:46.251 --> 02:08:47.219
YOU SEE THAT I'VE GOT LITTLE RED

02:08:47.286 --> 02:08:48.487
STARS THERE ON ALL OF THEM

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:49.655
BECAUSE THE STATE HAS TO JUST

02:08:49.721 --> 02:08:51.423
PLAY A MAJOR ROLE RECOGNIZING

02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:52.091
THAT.

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:53.392
A LOT OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE GONNA

02:08:53.459 --> 02:08:54.993
HAVE TO INVOLVE VARIOUS LOCAL

02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:56.662
PLAYERS URBAN WATER SYSTEMS YOUR

02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:58.864
CATION DISTRICTS COUNTIES AND SO

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.866
ON BUT THE STATE REALLY NEEDS TO

02:09:00.933 --> 02:09:02.601
PROVIDE SOME LEADERSHIP HERE --

02:09:02.668 --> 02:09:04.036
THERE IT WOULD AND WE HAVE TO

02:09:04.103 --> 02:09:05.337
THINK ABOUT THIS AS TECHNICAL

02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:07.573
MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL SO THE

02:09:07.639 --> 02:09:09.608
INSURER FINDING IS AN A IS A

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:11.110
NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT.

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:12.544
PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE IT'S ALSO

02:09:12.611 --> 02:09:14.346
FIGURE OUT HOW WE HOW WE'RE

02:09:14.413 --> 02:09:15.280
GONNA DO THEY DO THIS ON THE

02:09:15.347 --> 02:09:17.950
GROUND.

02:09:18.016 --> 02:09:19.852
AND GETTING AN ACTION PLAN --

02:09:19.918 --> 02:09:21.620
THIRD AREA I'M GONNA TOUCH ON IS

02:09:21.687 --> 02:09:22.988
THIS LONG TERM WRONG GROUND

02:09:23.055 --> 02:09:24.623
WATER QUALITY CHALLENGES --

02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:26.658
WHICH IS YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY AN

02:09:26.725 --> 02:09:28.293
ISSUE FOR FOR AGRICULTURAL

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:29.428
MANAGEMENT.

02:09:29.495 --> 02:09:32.731
OF NITRATE BEING BEING A KEY ONE

02:09:32.798 --> 02:09:34.266
THERE IS A A A A A NEW

02:09:34.333 --> 02:09:36.969
REGULATORY PROGRAM NOW EVEN OVER

02:09:37.035 --> 02:09:38.270
THE LAST DECADE OR SO WE'VE BEEN.

02:09:38.337 --> 02:09:40.038
WORKING TO TO TO REGULATE

02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:41.240
GROUNDWATER CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A

02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:44.042
LEADER ON THIS RELATIVE TO MANY

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:46.879
OTHER STATES -- AND SO THAT IS

02:09:46.945 --> 02:09:48.447
THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS PROGRAMS

02:09:48.514 --> 02:09:50.616
TO ROUTE TO BOTH FOR DAIRIES AND

02:09:50.682 --> 02:09:52.284
FOR YOUR GATED LANDS TO LOOK AT

02:09:52.351 --> 02:09:54.753
AT NITROGEN AS WELL AS AS WELL

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:56.855
AS AT FAULT -- IF THERE'S BEEN

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:59.124
PROGRESS MADE IN IN SOME WAYS

02:09:59.191 --> 02:10:00.726
BUT THIS IS A HARD AND IT'S

02:10:00.792 --> 02:10:01.827
ESPECIALLY HARD FOR DAIRIES

02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:03.428
WHICH IS WHAT I'M HIGHLIGHTING

02:10:03.495 --> 02:10:06.231
FOR YOU HERE -- THERE'S JUST ALL

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:08.033
TOO MUCH MINORE RELATIVE TO THE

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.301
CROP LAND THAT DAIRIES HAVE

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:13.138
AVAILABLE MENORES HARD TO MANAGE.

02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:13.972
EFFICIENTLY AND AND THERE'S NOW

02:10:14.039 --> 02:10:15.174
RECOGNITION THAT SOME OF THAT

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:16.775
WOOD NOR HAS TO BE ABLE TO BE

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:18.744
EXPORTED OFFER THE DAIRIES AND

02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:20.779
TRANSFORM TO BE USED IN SOME

02:10:20.846 --> 02:10:21.113
OTHER WAY SO.

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:23.415
JUST AS A KIND OF INDICATOR OF

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:26.485
THAT THE MAP A SHOWS YOU THE

02:10:26.552 --> 02:10:28.420
DERRY CROPLAND THOSE THOSE RED

02:10:28.487 --> 02:10:29.655
DOTS THERE.

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:31.924
AND THAT ALMOST MAPS YOU KNOW

02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:33.625
ONE FOR ONE WITH THE THE REAL

02:10:33.692 --> 02:10:35.127
HOT SPOTS FOR NITROGEN LOADING

02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:36.895
YOU CAN SEE THE THE THE BRIGHT

02:10:36.962 --> 02:10:39.765
RED AND ORANGE THERE -- ABOUT 6%

02:10:39.831 --> 02:10:41.400
OF CROPLAND IS DERRY CROPLAND

02:10:41.466 --> 02:10:44.803
AND ALMOST 90% OF THE HOT THE

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:46.738
HOTTEST HOT SPOTS IN NITROGEN

02:10:46.805 --> 02:10:48.373
LOADING ARE ARE ON THOSE

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:48.974
CROPLANDS.

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.209
SAYS IT'S A CHALLENGE THAT THIS

02:10:50.275 --> 02:10:53.111
THE SECTORS RECOGNIZING AND AND

02:10:53.178 --> 02:10:55.681
YOU KNOW TRUCK TRYING TO GRAPPLE

02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:56.515
WITH AT THIS POINT.

02:10:56.582 --> 02:10:58.016
ON THE OTHER ISSUE IS SOLVED AND

02:10:58.083 --> 02:10:58.817
THEN THIS WHERE'S MY TRADE IS

02:10:58.884 --> 02:11:00.152
REALLY AN ISSUE FOR DRINKING

02:11:00.219 --> 02:11:01.220
WATER QUALITY.

02:11:01.286 --> 02:11:03.222
SALT IS REALLY AN ISSUE FOR AG

02:11:03.288 --> 02:11:05.324
PRODUCTIVITY -- MAP SHOWS YOU

02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:07.125
KIND OF THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER

02:11:07.192 --> 02:11:08.860
GROUNDWATER SALINITY AND THE OF

02:11:08.927 --> 02:11:10.295
THE WEST SIDE OF THE VALLEY HAS

02:11:10.362 --> 02:11:12.931
SOME HAS LONG TERMS ASSAULT

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:13.799
ISSUES.

02:11:13.865 --> 02:11:15.267
THAT BAR CHART SHOWS YOU WHICH

02:11:15.334 --> 02:11:17.936
CROP START TO DECLINE YIELD THAT

02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:19.838
I WHICH LEVEL OF SALINITY AND A

02:11:19.905 --> 02:11:21.907
LOT OF THE HIGHER VALUE -- CROPS

02:11:21.974 --> 02:11:23.976
THAT ARE MOST QUICKLY AFFECTED

02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:25.677
BY SALINITY SO THIS IS A AN

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:26.778
ONGOING CHALLENGE FOR

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:28.480
AGRICULTURE AND THAT THE

02:11:28.547 --> 02:11:30.249
SOLUTIONS ARE THE TECHNICAL

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:32.451
SOLUTIONS ARE EXPENSIVE -- USE

02:11:32.517 --> 02:11:34.419
SOME OF THE BIG DE SALLE EFFORTS

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:35.187
AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE

02:11:35.254 --> 02:11:36.888
EXPENSIVE RELATIVE TO WHAT

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:38.590
FARMERS CAN AFFORD SO THIS IS AN

02:11:38.657 --> 02:11:40.826
ISSUE. FOR YOU WHERE FARMERS ARE

02:11:40.892 --> 02:11:43.528
OFTEN NOW REALLY USING ECONOMIC

02:11:43.595 --> 02:11:44.396
MANAGEMENT.

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:46.098
ALL RATHER THAN SORT OF THE THE

02:11:46.164 --> 02:11:47.199
THE BIG INFRASTRUCTURE

02:11:47.266 --> 02:11:48.634
INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S KIND

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.435
OF WHAT'S MOST COST EFFECTIVE IN

02:11:50.502 --> 02:11:51.870
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE TOOLS AS

02:11:51.937 --> 02:11:53.772
CROP SHIFTING THEIR OTHER THINGS

02:11:53.839 --> 02:11:54.640
YOU CAN DO ON THE FARM TO MANAGE

02:11:54.706 --> 02:11:56.675
AS BUT ALSO OVER TIME.

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:58.176
SOME LAND IT COMES OUT OF

02:11:58.243 --> 02:11:59.645
PRODUCTION OF BECAUSE ASSAULTS

02:11:59.711 --> 02:12:02.447
ALREADY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

02:12:02.514 --> 02:12:03.048
THOUSAND ACRES OF COME OUT OF

02:12:03.115 --> 02:12:04.216
PRODUCTION OVER TIME.

02:12:04.283 --> 02:12:08.353
AND THERE'S ANOTHER ESTIMATED I

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:09.688
THINK ONE POINT. FIVE MILLION

02:12:09.755 --> 02:12:10.822
ACRES THAT ARE BETTER SALT

02:12:10.889 --> 02:12:11.857
IMPACTED SO SOMETHING TO THINK

02:12:11.923 --> 02:12:13.625
ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF IT SOME

02:12:13.692 --> 02:12:14.693
LAND IT'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:16.762
OF PRODUCTION FOR WATER SUPPLY.

02:12:16.828 --> 02:12:17.863
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO COORDINATE

02:12:17.929 --> 02:12:19.464
THAT WITH WITH THE SALT

02:12:19.531 --> 02:12:21.333
MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.735
WATER CAN BE FLEXIBLY MOVED. TO

02:12:23.802 --> 02:12:26.171
THE MOST PRODUCTIVE LANDS --

02:12:26.238 --> 02:12:27.939
THEN AT ONE THING ALSO FLAG FOR

02:12:28.006 --> 02:12:28.840
YOU AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:12:28.907 --> 02:12:30.676
THOMAS CAN CAN AMONG OTHER

02:12:30.742 --> 02:12:32.277
THINGS THE THOMAS CAN TALK A LOT

02:12:32.344 --> 02:12:33.645
MORE ABOUT IS.

02:12:33.712 --> 02:12:35.881
HOW TO MANAGE QUALITY AND

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:37.049
QUANTITY TOGETHER WHEN YOU THINK

02:12:37.115 --> 02:12:38.550
ABOUT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WHICH

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:40.285
IS THE SIZE YOU KNOW THE BIG ONE

02:12:40.352 --> 02:12:42.487
OF THE BIG TOOLS FOR THE VALLEY

02:12:42.554 --> 02:12:44.723
IN TERMS OF A COST EFFECTIVE?

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:46.258
OPTION FOR EXPANDING SUPPLY.

02:12:46.325 --> 02:12:49.194
ARM PUTTING RECHARGE ON CROP

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:51.430
LAND IS A PRETTY GOOD OPTION

02:12:51.496 --> 02:12:53.198
FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE THERE'S

02:12:53.265 --> 02:12:55.367
A LOT OF CROP LAND IN THE VALLEY

02:12:55.434 --> 02:12:57.569
THAT HAS SUITABLE SOILS.

02:12:57.636 --> 02:12:59.237
THE FOLKS ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH

02:12:59.304 --> 02:13:01.006
THIS AND YOU KNOW FARMERS LIKE

02:13:01.073 --> 02:13:02.641
DON CAMERON FROM THE STATE BOARD

02:13:02.708 --> 02:13:04.242
OF FOOD A NAGGING OTHERS OF AN

02:13:04.309 --> 02:13:06.211
EXPERIMENT WITH THOSE FOLKS THAT

02:13:06.278 --> 02:13:07.012
YOU YOU SEE DAVIS I'VE BEEN

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:08.013
WORKING ON THIS I'M A RESEARCH

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:09.114
PERSPECTIVE.

02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:10.882
THE ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:11.883
BEYOND JUST KIND OF ARE YOU

02:13:11.950 --> 02:13:13.218
LEGALLY ENTITLED TO GET THE

02:13:13.285 --> 02:13:14.519
WATER AND ALL OF THOSE SORT OF

02:13:14.586 --> 02:13:15.854
INSTITUTIONAL THINGS.

02:13:15.921 --> 02:13:18.323
IS MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT.

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:20.459
IMPAIRING WATER QUALITY IN WAYS

02:13:20.525 --> 02:13:22.394
THAT RUN AFOUL OF REGULATIONS

02:13:22.461 --> 02:13:23.829
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:25.364
IF YOU PUT A LOT OF WATER ON THE

02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:26.331
SOILS.

02:13:26.398 --> 02:13:28.133
YOU CAN END UP PUSHING NITROGEN

02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.534
DOWN INTO THE INTO THE WATER

02:13:29.601 --> 02:13:31.303
TABLE AND WHAT THIS CROP WE'LL

02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:33.705
SHOWS YOU HERE IS THAT.

02:13:33.772 --> 02:13:36.074
OF ALL THE SUITABLE SOILS IN THE

02:13:36.141 --> 02:13:37.008
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IT'S ABOUT

02:13:37.075 --> 02:13:38.377
HALF A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF

02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:40.245
OF ALL THE YEAR GET A CROP LAND.

02:13:40.312 --> 02:13:42.714
IS SUITABLE -- ONLY THAT DARK

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.349
BLUE PORTION IS KIND OF

02:13:44.416 --> 02:13:46.051
CONSIDERED CLEAN CROPS THAT.

02:13:46.118 --> 02:13:47.586
WERE YOU WOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY

02:13:47.652 --> 02:13:50.288
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT ISSUE.

02:13:50.355 --> 02:13:52.324
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER CROPS

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:53.592
THAT ARE POTENTIALLY SUITABLE

02:13:53.658 --> 02:13:56.094
CAN TOLERATE OF THE THE RECHARGE

02:13:56.161 --> 02:13:57.362
BUT WERE YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

02:13:57.429 --> 02:13:58.530
THE NITROGEN MANAGEMENT AND

02:13:58.597 --> 02:14:01.266
THAT'S THAT WHOLE HALF THEIR OF

02:14:01.333 --> 02:14:02.734
OF THE GREEN THE GREEN THERE

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:06.204
WITH ALMONDS AND PISTACHIOS --

02:14:06.271 --> 02:14:07.906
AT OTHER TREE CROPS AND SO ON SO

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:09.541
SOMETHING TO SOMETHING TO THINK

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:11.543
ABOUT WHERE THE STATE IS GOING

02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:12.644
TO NEED TO HELP.

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:13.945
PROVIDE SOME CLARITY ON THE

02:14:14.012 --> 02:14:16.214
REGULATORY SIDE ARM AND IN FACT

02:14:16.281 --> 02:14:18.116
THERE IS YOUR THESE ARE ARE ARE

02:14:18.183 --> 02:14:19.151
ARE SORT OF PRIORITIES A LOT

02:14:19.217 --> 02:14:20.552
IT'S HAS TO HAPPEN.

02:14:20.619 --> 02:14:22.287
AGAIN BY A LOCAL AND REGIONAL

02:14:22.354 --> 02:14:23.822
ACTORS BUT THE STATE CAN BE

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:24.790
REALLY.

02:14:24.856 --> 02:14:26.691
IMPORTANT IN HELPING PROVIDE

02:14:26.758 --> 02:14:29.027
GUIDANCE AND SOME REGULATORY

02:14:29.094 --> 02:14:31.730
FLEXIBILITY ON MANAGING THE LONG

02:14:31.797 --> 02:14:32.864
TERM NITROGEN SALT.

02:14:32.931 --> 02:14:34.199
ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF

02:14:34.266 --> 02:14:35.233
THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:37.235
RECHARGE AND THE THE NEW SALT

02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:39.471
AND NITRATE CONTROL PROGRAM THAT

02:14:39.538 --> 02:14:41.673
THE REGIONAL BOARD HAS ADOPTED

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:43.909
AND THAT IS STILL -- IS PENDING

02:14:43.975 --> 02:14:46.077
APPROVAL BY THE STATE WATER

02:14:46.144 --> 02:14:46.578
BOARD.

02:14:46.645 --> 02:14:48.146
HAS SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY

02:14:48.213 --> 02:14:50.615
BUILT IN ARM IN A WAY THAT KIND

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:52.551
OF INSURERS THAT.

02:14:52.617 --> 02:14:54.586
AS LONG AS FOLKS ARE ADDRESSING

02:14:54.653 --> 02:14:57.055
SAFE DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS

02:14:57.122 --> 02:14:58.890
URGENTLY -- THERE THEY PROVIDE

02:14:58.957 --> 02:15:00.425
SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR LONGER TERM

02:15:00.492 --> 02:15:02.494
LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS ON ON THE

02:15:02.561 --> 02:15:04.362
AG SIDE WHICH WOULD WHICH WHICH

02:15:04.429 --> 02:15:07.265
WE THINK IS THE IT IS IS A SMART

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:08.433
APPROACH.

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:10.502
SO LAST ONE THIS IS THIS IDEA OF

02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:12.003
KIND OF I DON'T KNOW I SOMETIMES

02:15:12.070 --> 02:15:13.572
CALLED MAKING LEMONADE OUT OF

02:15:13.638 --> 02:15:15.340
LEMONS -- WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE

02:15:15.407 --> 02:15:17.943
IDEA THAT SOME LAND IS LIKELY TO

02:15:18.009 --> 02:15:19.578
BE COMING OUT OF PRODUCTION.

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:20.946
HOW TO MANAGE THAT IN WAYS THEY

02:15:21.012 --> 02:15:22.647
GET VALUE FOR THE VALLEY AS

02:15:22.714 --> 02:15:25.050
OPPOSED TO JUST CAUSING NEGATIVE

02:15:25.116 --> 02:15:26.551
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES?

02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:30.055
OF WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE

02:15:30.121 --> 02:15:32.157
THERE'S NOT ANY WHERE NEAR THE

02:15:32.224 --> 02:15:33.458
KIND OF THINKING OR PLANNING

02:15:33.525 --> 02:15:34.826
THIS AWARENESS IS BEGINNING TO

02:15:34.893 --> 02:15:36.728
BE AWARENESS OF THIS ISSUE.

02:15:36.795 --> 02:15:38.630
BUT NOT NOT THE THOSE KIND OF

02:15:38.697 --> 02:15:40.465
SERIOUS PLANNING THAT'S NEEDED

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:41.333
TO THINK ABOUT.

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:44.002
HOW TO HOW TO AVOID A KIND OF

02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:46.404
FARM BY FARM YOU KNOW POSTAGE

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:47.339
STAMP APPROACH TO THIS THAT

02:15:47.405 --> 02:15:49.441
DOESN'T GET VALUE FROM THE LANDS

02:15:49.508 --> 02:15:50.542
AND THIS PIE CHART?

02:15:50.609 --> 02:15:51.776
THIS DOUGHNUT JUST GIVES YOU A

02:15:51.843 --> 02:15:54.112
SENSE OF THAT HERE I'M LOOKING

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:56.548
AT THE ARE ARE SORT OF LOW BALL

02:15:56.615 --> 02:15:57.816
ESTIMATE OF LAND COMING OUT OF

02:15:57.883 --> 02:15:59.618
PRODUCTION THIS IS IN THE IN THE

02:15:59.684 --> 02:16:01.219
SORT OF OPTIMAL APPROACH WHERE

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:03.054
YOU GET NEW SUPPLIES SO IT'S A

02:16:03.121 --> 02:16:04.456
LITTLE BIT OVER.

02:16:04.523 --> 02:16:05.123
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES THAT

02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:06.324
WOULD COME OUT OF PRODUCTION

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:08.126
OVER OVER TIME.

02:16:08.193 --> 02:16:11.096
AND THE THE SMALLER LITTLE

02:16:11.162 --> 02:16:12.964
SLICES OF THAT DOUGHNUT THOSE

02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:15.166
ARE KIND OF THE THE AMOUNT OF

02:16:15.233 --> 02:16:16.801
LAND THAT ARE YOU KNOW UNDER

02:16:16.868 --> 02:16:19.604
EXISTING PLANNING PROCESS THESE.

02:16:19.671 --> 02:16:22.207
UP COULD LIKELY FIT INTO SOME

02:16:22.274 --> 02:16:24.009
KIND OF SPECIFIC ACTIVITY THAT

02:16:24.075 --> 02:16:25.944
INCLUDES THERE'S A RECOVERY PLAN

02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:27.512
FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN DESERT WHICH

02:16:27.579 --> 02:16:28.847
WOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND

02:16:28.914 --> 02:16:29.514
ACRES.

02:16:29.581 --> 02:16:31.283
MAYBE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES

02:16:31.349 --> 02:16:33.318
OF SOLAR -- IN THE COCKPIT OF

02:16:33.385 --> 02:16:34.753
ADDITIONAL SOLAR BEYOND WHAT'S

02:16:34.819 --> 02:16:37.989
BEEN DONE -- AND THEN A MAYBE

02:16:38.056 --> 02:16:38.990
TWENTY THOUSAND EACH OF RIPARIAN

02:16:39.057 --> 02:16:41.226
QUARTERS AND OR EXPANDING

02:16:41.293 --> 02:16:42.961
REPAIRING QUARTERS AND AND SOME

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:44.563
MORE IN INTERMENT WETLANDS OF

02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:45.597
THE TYPE THAT YOU SEE IN THE

02:16:45.664 --> 02:16:46.765
CURRENT WATER BANK.

02:16:46.831 --> 02:16:47.866
WHICH IS A GROUND WATER BANK

02:16:47.933 --> 02:16:49.701
THAT THAT IS IT INTERMITTENTLY

02:16:49.768 --> 02:16:51.803
ALSO HOT REVERT BIRD HABITAT SO

02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:54.472
THIS WHOLE BIG TWO THIRDS OF THE

02:16:54.539 --> 02:16:56.541
OF THIS DONATH THE YEP THE

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:57.142
GOLDEN PART.

02:16:57.208 --> 02:16:59.744
IS JUST IT'S NOT SPECIFIC LAND

02:16:59.811 --> 02:17:00.378
THAT WE'RE SHOWING HERE SO MUCH

02:17:00.445 --> 02:17:02.080
AS JUST THE IDEA THAT THERE'S

02:17:02.147 --> 02:17:04.716
MORE THAN FITS IN THOSE IN THOSE

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:06.117
CATEGORIES SO FAR.

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:10.689
WE THINK THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL

02:17:10.755 --> 02:17:12.090
TO STEWART ALL OF THESE LANDS IN

02:17:12.157 --> 02:17:12.757
BENEFICIAL WAYS AND SOME OF THAT

02:17:12.824 --> 02:17:13.491
CAN BE ROTATIONAL FOLLOWING

02:17:13.558 --> 02:17:14.492
WHERE YOU'RE IMPROVING SOIL

02:17:14.559 --> 02:17:15.060
HEALTH.

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:16.728
GETTING SOME BENEFITS IN TERMS

02:17:16.795 --> 02:17:18.296
OF EVEN IMPROVING THE ABILITY TO

02:17:18.363 --> 02:17:20.098
RETAIN MOISTURE BUT ALSO STORING

02:17:20.165 --> 02:17:21.800
CARBON IN THE MEAN TIME BUT THEN

02:17:21.866 --> 02:17:23.602
PROBABLY YOU KNOW USING SOME OF

02:17:23.668 --> 02:17:26.304
THESE LANDS IN IN IN OTHER WAYS.

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:27.372
TO TO KIND OF STACKED STACKED

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:30.041
BENEFITS -- FOR BRINGING IN

02:17:30.108 --> 02:17:31.576
REVENUES FOR FOR GROWERS FOR

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:33.511
LANDOWNERS BUT ALSO GETTING SOME

02:17:33.578 --> 02:17:34.879
YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH AND

02:17:34.946 --> 02:17:37.882
RECREATIONAL AND FLOOD CONTROL --

02:17:37.949 --> 02:17:39.284
VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF BENEFITS

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:40.552
FOR THE REGION.

02:17:40.619 --> 02:17:44.255
SO A PRIORITIES FOR THIS -- GOT

02:17:44.322 --> 02:17:45.590
TO START WITH SOME BROAD BASED

02:17:45.657 --> 02:17:46.691
PLANNING.

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:48.693
IMPLEMENTING FLEXIBLE REGULATORY

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.228
APPROACHES AGAIN THAT THING THE

02:17:50.295 --> 02:17:52.597
FLEXIBILITY PROVIDING FINANCIAL

02:17:52.664 --> 02:17:54.499
INCENTIVES AND BOOSTING

02:17:54.566 --> 02:17:56.167
TECHNICAL SUPPORT R. D. U. C.

02:17:56.234 --> 02:17:57.902
GOT I'VE GOT STARS ON ALL BUT

02:17:57.969 --> 02:17:59.204
THE TOP ONE THAT'S NOT BECAUSE

02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:00.071
THE STATE.

02:18:00.138 --> 02:18:01.006
DOESN'T HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY

02:18:01.072 --> 02:18:02.507
THERE JUST THE STATE OBVIOUSLY

02:18:02.574 --> 02:18:04.142
CAN'T TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN

02:18:04.209 --> 02:18:06.011
LAND USE PLANNING IN IN THIS IS

02:18:06.077 --> 02:18:07.646
THAT'S A THAT'S A LOCAL AND

02:18:07.712 --> 02:18:08.513
REGIONAL THING.

02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:10.882
BUT WE THINK ACTUALLY THE STATE

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:14.052
CAN BE IMPORTANT AS A SUPPORTER

02:18:14.119 --> 02:18:15.286
OF OF THAT.

02:18:15.353 --> 02:18:16.755
SO JUST TO WRAP UP WITH A FEW

02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:18.590
THOUGHTS ON YOU KNOW THIS IS A

02:18:18.657 --> 02:18:20.091
HUGE AGENDA AND IT'S NOT AN

02:18:20.158 --> 02:18:22.360
OVERNIGHT AGENDA OF FOR ALL OF

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:23.395
THE THINGS I'VE TALKED ABOUT

02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:25.163
WHERE WHERE CAN YOU BE MOST

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:26.097
HELPFUL.

02:18:26.164 --> 02:18:27.732
IN THE NEAR TERM THE FIRST ONE

02:18:27.799 --> 02:18:29.668
IS SAFE DRINKING WATER AND I

02:18:29.734 --> 02:18:32.804
THINK IT'S NOT JUST THE FUNDING

02:18:32.871 --> 02:18:33.972
IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE THERE IS A

02:18:34.039 --> 02:18:37.242
A COMPREHENSIVE ROBUST FRAMEWORK

02:18:37.308 --> 02:18:38.476
FOR ADDRESSING BOTH THE THE

02:18:38.543 --> 02:18:39.911
QUALITY AND THE SUPPLY.

02:18:39.978 --> 02:18:41.046
ISSUES.

02:18:41.112 --> 02:18:43.314
THE SECOND IS SUPPORTING THE

02:18:43.381 --> 02:18:44.482
REGION'S TRANSITION TO GROUND

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:46.484
WATER SUSTAINABILITY AND THIS IS

02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:49.287
THINKING ABOUT IN THE FIRST FIVE

02:18:49.354 --> 02:18:51.289
YEARS OF THESE PLANS PEOPLE ARE

02:18:51.356 --> 02:18:52.924
GOING TO BE JUST.

02:18:52.991 --> 02:18:54.893
REALLY GEARING UP ARM HOW TO

02:18:54.959 --> 02:18:56.695
SUPPORT THAT SO.

02:18:56.761 --> 02:18:58.997
NUMBER ONE IS THE STATE GETTING

02:18:59.064 --> 02:19:01.733
ITS OWN REGULATORY.

02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:03.635
SILOS A LITTLE BIT ON THE SIDE

02:19:03.702 --> 02:19:05.003
LOAD SO THAT THERE CAN BE

02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:07.405
SUPPORT YOU KNOW FOR FOR WHAT

02:19:07.472 --> 02:19:08.740
NEEDS TO BE DONE ACROSS THESE

02:19:08.807 --> 02:19:10.241
DIFFERENT CHALLENGE AREAS.

02:19:10.308 --> 02:19:11.976
THE SECOND IS HELPING TO ASSESS

02:19:12.043 --> 02:19:13.611
SMART INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS

02:19:13.678 --> 02:19:15.580
AND THEN SUPPORTING PILOTS ON

02:19:15.647 --> 02:19:16.815
THE GROUND AND I THINK YOU KNOW

02:19:16.881 --> 02:19:18.416
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES CAN BE

02:19:18.483 --> 02:19:19.851
REALLY HELPFUL IN THAT KIND OF

02:19:19.918 --> 02:19:22.387
THING -- AS WELL AS TECHNICAL

02:19:22.454 --> 02:19:23.822
SUPPORT OUR INDIE.

02:19:23.888 --> 02:19:25.290
AND SUPPORTING PLANNING.

02:19:25.356 --> 02:19:28.593

YOU WANT ME TO GO NEXT.

02:19:42.707 --> 02:19:44.642
WELL MY FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON

02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:46.911

AND I'M ALSO THE ASSOCIATE

02:19:55.487 --> 02:19:57.856

IN POLICY INITIATIVES WHICH IS

02:19:59.891 --> 02:20:01.559
HELD OUT OF THE CHANCELLOR'S

02:20:01.626 --> 02:20:03.328
OFFICE FOR ALL TWENTY THREE

02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:03.995
CAMPUSES.

02:20:04.062 --> 02:20:06.131
AND ONE OF THE PROJECTS THAT I'M

02:20:06.197 --> 02:20:07.499
WORKING ON THROUGH THE

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.634
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE -- PROGRAM

02:20:09.701 --> 02:20:12.370
AT WPI IS TO HANDHOLD DAX

THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GETTING --

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:17.342
APPLICATIONS TO THE SYSTEM FOR A

02:20:17.408 --> 02:20:19.210
FINANCING SO -- FOR EXAMPLE I'M

02:20:19.277 --> 02:20:22.113
WORKING WITH -- A SMALL RURAL

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:23.782
SCHOOL IN THE MANTI CARE AREA AS

02:20:23.848 --> 02:20:27.118
WELL AS THE CITY PORTOLA -- AND

02:20:27.185 --> 02:20:29.621
PICKING UP A COUPLE MORE IN THE

02:20:29.687 --> 02:20:31.122
NEXT FEW MONTHS -- THERE'S A

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:32.724
COUPLE PROBLEMS WITH THAT NOT

02:20:32.791 --> 02:20:33.358
ALL COMMENT ON THAT A LITTLE

02:20:33.424 --> 02:20:35.293
LATER BUT I REALLY WANTED TO

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.262
HELP YOU WITH IS IS THE NOTION

02:20:37.328 --> 02:20:39.864
THAT WE REALLY CAN FOCUS ON

02:20:39.931 --> 02:20:41.032
DEALING WITH SOME OF THE

02:20:41.099 --> 02:20:43.434
DRINKING WATER ISSUES ESPECIALLY.

02:20:43.501 --> 02:20:45.036
FOR THE SMALL COMMUNITIES THAT

02:20:45.103 --> 02:20:46.304
WERE NOTED IN OUR REPORT ON THE

02:20:46.371 --> 02:20:48.907
PP I SEE -- IN THE SOME LOOKING

02:20:48.973 --> 02:20:50.909
VALLEY ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT

02:20:50.975 --> 02:20:53.278
ARE NON COMPLIANT -- UP A YOU

02:20:53.344 --> 02:20:55.480
SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

02:20:55.547 --> 02:20:56.414
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY

02:20:56.481 --> 02:20:58.583
INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE

02:20:58.650 --> 02:20:59.984
THEIR OWN DRINKING WATER SYSTEM.

02:21:00.051 --> 02:21:00.985
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:02.954
CALIFORNIA WE DON'T KNOW YET HOW

02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:04.389
MANY ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE

02:21:04.455 --> 02:21:06.457
DRINKING WATER STANDARDS BUT

02:21:06.524 --> 02:21:08.226
CLEARLY -- THAT'S A SPECIAL

02:21:08.293 --> 02:21:10.061
PROJECT THAT WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A

02:21:10.128 --> 02:21:12.030
LOOK AT AT TO HELP THEM OUT TO

02:21:12.096 --> 02:21:13.164
MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

02:21:13.231 --> 02:21:16.167
SUSTAINABILITY -- AT ONE OF THE

02:21:16.234 --> 02:21:17.569
THINGS THAT I THINK WE WANT TO

02:21:17.635 --> 02:21:20.004
FOCUS ON IS THE MAKING SURE THAT

02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:22.140
THE FUNDING THAT WE DO GIVE TO

02:21:22.207 --> 02:21:23.775
THE SMALL COMMUNITIES.

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.376
HAS A PRIORITY AND WHAT I'M

02:21:25.443 --> 02:21:27.345
RECOMMENDING IS IS THAT WE DO

02:21:27.412 --> 02:21:29.380
NEED TO PERHAPS PRIORITIZE CLEAN

02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:31.349
DRINKING WATER AS ONE OF THE

02:21:31.416 --> 02:21:32.984
FIRST AREAS THAT WE NEED TO

02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:34.652
FINANCE AND PERHAPS EVEN FAST

02:21:34.719 --> 02:21:37.188
TRACK PROCESS. TO GET THAT GOING

02:21:37.255 --> 02:21:38.990
SO WHERE ARE THEY WHAT ARE THEY

02:21:39.057 --> 02:21:41.693
DOING -- WE NEED TO REPLACE SOME

02:21:41.759 --> 02:21:43.061
OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS IN

02:21:43.127 --> 02:21:45.096
CALIFORNIA -- ESPECIALLY WHERE

02:21:45.163 --> 02:21:46.798
IT'S AT ITS END OF ITS USABLE

02:21:46.865 --> 02:21:52.170
LIFE AND BUT THAT'S ALSO LINKED

02:21:52.237 --> 02:21:54.739
TO DRINKING WATER SO YOUR SEEN

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:56.074
THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PIPE THAT

02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:57.108
BLEW UP ON SUNSET BOULEVARD

02:21:57.175 --> 02:21:59.510
RIGHT -- THE I DID PART OF UCLA

02:21:59.577 --> 02:22:00.879
OF SO THERE'S SOME OLD STUFF IN

02:22:00.945 --> 02:22:01.479
THE GROUND SO WE THINK THAT'S

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:01.779
IMPORTANT.

02:22:01.846 --> 02:22:02.380
I THINK IF THERE IS A WATER

02:22:02.447 --> 02:22:03.815
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT

02:22:03.882 --> 02:22:04.849
DESIGNED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

02:22:04.916 --> 02:22:06.784
PURPOSES WAS ALREADY MENTIONED

02:22:06.851 --> 02:22:07.886
EARLIER BY.

02:22:07.952 --> 02:22:09.921
MS EHLERS THAT WE NEED TO

02:22:09.988 --> 02:22:11.589
SUPPORT THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE

02:22:11.656 --> 02:22:13.558
PRACTICES THAT DELIVER

02:22:13.625 --> 02:22:15.226
QUANTIFIABLE RESULTS FOR THE

02:22:15.293 --> 02:22:17.295
ENVIRONMENT THAT'S OUTCOME BASED

02:22:17.362 --> 02:22:18.529
THAT SHE MENTIONED.

02:22:18.596 --> 02:22:20.498
SO -- TO TALK A LITTLE BIT THEN

02:22:20.565 --> 02:22:21.933
ABOUT -- SOME OF THIS OTHER

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.801
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES THAT WERE

02:22:23.868 --> 02:22:26.304
WORKING ON AND I THINK WE NEED

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:28.172
TO ALSO REMEMBER THAT A LOT OF

02:22:28.239 --> 02:22:30.742
MORE PRIVATE WHETHER IT'S THE

02:22:30.808 --> 02:22:32.944
MOBILE HOME PARKS IN SOME CASES

02:22:33.011 --> 02:22:34.078
CAMPGROUNDS.

02:22:34.145 --> 02:22:36.014
THOSE ARE ALL WHAT THEY CALL NON

02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:37.582
TRANSIENT NON COMMUNITY WATER

02:22:37.649 --> 02:22:41.686
SYSTEMS IN WATER SPEAK IN THE

02:22:41.753 --> 02:22:43.121
DRINKING WATER WORLD.

02:22:43.187 --> 02:22:44.022
SO THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY

02:22:44.088 --> 02:22:46.591
TO TRY AND GET OUR ARMS AROUND

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:48.493
WHO THEY ARE WHERE THEY ARE AND

02:22:48.559 --> 02:22:49.861
WHAT KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL

02:22:49.928 --> 02:22:51.462
CHANGES WE MIGHT NEED TO MAKE TO

02:22:51.529 --> 02:22:53.631
HELP THEM OUT. ONE EXAMPLE IS IT

02:22:53.698 --> 02:22:54.899
WITH ANOTHER RECENT CONTRACT

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:56.668
WE'RE WORKING ON IS THE CITY OF

02:22:56.734 --> 02:22:58.670
FRESNO IS GOING TO ACT AS A

02:22:58.736 --> 02:23:00.705
FOCAL POINT FOR HOOKING UP.

02:23:00.772 --> 02:23:02.540
SATELLITE SYSTEMS COMMUNITIES

02:23:02.607 --> 02:23:04.809
AROUND THE CITY OF FRESNO TO SEE

02:23:04.876 --> 02:23:05.977
WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES WHAT

02:23:06.044 --> 02:23:07.478
ARE THE CHALLENGES AND WHAT ARE

02:23:07.545 --> 02:23:08.713
THE COSTS GOING TO BE.

02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:10.748
SO IT'S KIND OF A OF A PATTERN

02:23:10.815 --> 02:23:12.850
OR A PRECEDENT SETTING PROCESS

02:23:12.917 --> 02:23:14.819
THAT WERE INVOLVED IN IT IS ONCE

02:23:14.886 --> 02:23:16.654
AGAIN THROUGH THE W. R..

02:23:16.721 --> 02:23:19.457
T. I. PROCESS IN ADDITION THE

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:21.159
CAMPUS AT FRESNO STATE IS ITS

02:23:21.225 --> 02:23:22.527
OWN WATER SYSTEM NOT A LOT OF

02:23:22.593 --> 02:23:24.028
PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DELIVER.

02:23:24.095 --> 02:23:25.596
BOTH ARE DRINKING WATER AND

02:23:25.663 --> 02:23:27.765
WATER TO OUR FARM -- IN WHAT

02:23:27.832 --> 02:23:29.534
PART OF THE GSA AND AND NOW

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:31.369
WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT NOT ONLY

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:33.471
TO DO RESEARCH ON RECHARGE

02:23:33.538 --> 02:23:36.607
BENEFITS BUT ALSO A TWENTY FIVE

02:23:36.674 --> 02:23:37.208
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR OF

02:23:37.275 --> 02:23:38.943
CAMPUS IN KIND STAFF SERVICES.

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:40.645
TO HELP OUR GSA WITH SOME OF THE

02:23:40.712 --> 02:23:41.679
ISSUES SO THE KIND OF

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:43.314
PARTNERSHIPS I THINK ARE THE

02:23:43.381 --> 02:23:44.649
KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO

02:23:44.716 --> 02:23:47.585
DO MORE OF ONE OF THE BIG THINGS

02:23:47.652 --> 02:23:50.488
THAT -- I'M INVESTED IN IS ALSO

02:23:50.555 --> 02:23:52.724
THE NOTION THAT WAS MENTIONED BY --

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:55.026
MS EHLERS A GNAT IS MEASUREMENT

02:23:55.093 --> 02:23:57.161
AND MONITORING -- WE NEED TO

02:23:57.228 --> 02:23:59.097
MORE INVESTMENTS IN IN THAT TYPE

02:23:59.163 --> 02:24:02.066
OF ACTIVITY -- IT IN IN A GOOD

02:24:02.133 --> 02:24:03.735
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE THAT I HAVE

02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:05.403
JUST LAST WEEK.

02:24:05.470 --> 02:24:07.305
WE HAVE AT THE FRESNO STATE

02:24:07.372 --> 02:24:08.673
CAMPUS AN INCUBATOR WERE FUNDED

02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:10.074
BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

02:24:10.141 --> 02:24:11.776
COMMISSION TO DO WATER AND

02:24:11.843 --> 02:24:13.978
ENERGY TECHNOLOGY INCUBATION.

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:16.681
AT A COMPANY HAS ARRIVED AND

02:24:16.748 --> 02:24:17.582
WE'RE GOING TO BRING THEM TO OUR

02:24:17.648 --> 02:24:19.550
PROCESS THAT CAN INSTANTANEOUSLY

02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:21.386
TEST FOR E. COLI.

02:24:21.452 --> 02:24:24.389
THESE THE ONE NUMBER ONE ANY

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:25.957
INDICATOR OF BACTERIAL COMIC

02:24:26.024 --> 02:24:27.992
CONTAMINATION IN WATER USUALLY

02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:28.760
YOU HAVE TO SEND IT TO A

02:24:28.826 --> 02:24:30.194
LABORATORY TAKES TWENTY FOUR

02:24:30.261 --> 02:24:31.729
HOURS FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE

02:24:31.796 --> 02:24:33.197
YOU GET RESULTS THIS IS REALLY

02:24:33.264 --> 02:24:34.298
IMPORTANT.

02:24:34.365 --> 02:24:36.434
YOU CAN TEST IT INSTANTANEOUSLY

02:24:36.501 --> 02:24:37.568
AND THIS THING WORKS AND IT'S A

02:24:37.635 --> 02:24:39.170
CHIP. TO CHIP IN A HAND HELD

02:24:39.237 --> 02:24:44.976
DEVICE.

02:24:45.043 --> 02:24:47.011
SO WE THINK THAT.

02:24:47.078 --> 02:24:48.279
AN INVESTMENT IS ALSO PART OF

02:24:48.346 --> 02:24:49.147
THE SOLUTION TO SOME OF THE

02:24:49.213 --> 02:24:49.914
WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS AND

02:24:49.981 --> 02:24:52.050
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE FACING US IN

02:24:52.116 --> 02:24:54.786
CALIFORNIA -- ALONG. ONE OF THE

02:24:54.852 --> 02:24:56.054
THINGS THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE

02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:57.488
NEED TO DO IS THAT WE WE NEED

02:24:57.555 --> 02:24:59.757
BETTER INTEGRATION IT'S SOME OF

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:02.627
OUR AGENCIES AS WELL -- ONE OF

02:25:02.693 --> 02:25:04.162
THE IDEAS IS THAT.

02:25:04.228 --> 02:25:06.497
WE DO NOT HAVE ACTUAL TECHNICAL

02:25:06.564 --> 02:25:08.232
EXPERTS IN EITHER OF THE WATER

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:09.867
BOARD OR DEPARTMENT WATER

02:25:09.934 --> 02:25:11.102
RESOURCES THAT ARE WHITE HAT

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:13.538
PEOPLE THAT CAN ASSIST AND

02:25:13.604 --> 02:25:15.807
REVIEW AND LOOK AT WHETHER OR

02:25:15.873 --> 02:25:18.276
NOT -- THE PROPOSAL FOR

02:25:18.342 --> 02:25:20.311
DEVELOPING A CYST SOLUTION TO A

02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:21.712
SYSTEM IS THE RIGHT.

02:25:21.779 --> 02:25:23.347
ONE AND THE EXAMPLE I POINT TO

02:25:23.414 --> 02:25:25.450
AN A TALKED ABOUT IN NUMEROUS

02:25:25.516 --> 02:25:27.218
PLACES YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT.

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:28.352
IS LYNN THERE.

02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:29.921
WHEN THERE IS A SMALL COMMUNITY

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:31.656
IN WESTERN FRESNO COUNTY THAT

02:25:31.722 --> 02:25:33.858
HAD A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR

02:25:33.925 --> 02:25:35.927
ARSENIC PLANT BUILT AND IT'S

02:25:35.993 --> 02:25:36.627
SITTING IDLE?

02:25:36.694 --> 02:25:39.130
BECAUSE THE CITY -- THE GIGA

02:25:39.197 --> 02:25:39.730
COMMUNITY RESIDENTS COULD NOT

02:25:39.797 --> 02:25:41.132
AFFORD.

02:25:41.199 --> 02:25:42.100
AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED

02:25:42.166 --> 02:25:43.701
IF WE HAD THE RIGHT ADVICE IN

02:25:43.768 --> 02:25:44.869
THE FIRST PLACE TO PLANT TO

02:25:44.936 --> 02:25:48.973
REMOVE ARSENIC NOT TO PUT A IT'S

02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:52.677
TO REMOVE OUR SHOT IT. TO GET

02:25:52.743 --> 02:25:53.778
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET YOU TO

02:25:53.845 --> 02:25:55.213
GET A LITTLE MORE YEAH IT WAS TO

02:25:55.279 --> 02:25:56.614
REMOVE OUR STICK AT AND IT AND

02:25:56.681 --> 02:25:58.216
IT'S IT'S BEEN A FAILURE.

02:25:58.282 --> 02:25:59.884
SO WE NEED SOME WHITE HAD PEOPLE

02:25:59.951 --> 02:26:01.419
IN SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT CAN

02:26:01.486 --> 02:26:03.020
ACTUALLY GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT

02:26:03.087 --> 02:26:05.323
OF PROPER PROJECTS RATHER THAN

02:26:05.389 --> 02:26:07.558
JUST REGULATED AND RIGHT WE HAVE --

02:26:07.625 --> 02:26:08.759
THE DIVISION A DRINK OF WATER

02:26:08.826 --> 02:26:11.329
CANNOT ADVISE PEOPLE ON WHAT TO

02:26:11.395 --> 02:26:14.765
USE -- I THINK THAT THE REAL BIG

02:26:14.832 --> 02:26:17.101
AREA THOUGH IS THE INSTITUTIONAL

02:26:17.168 --> 02:26:19.103
ASPECT AND WHAT I'M SUGGESTING

02:26:19.170 --> 02:26:19.737
IS.

02:26:19.804 --> 02:26:21.339
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A KIND OF A

02:26:21.405 --> 02:26:22.440
STRESS TEST.

02:26:22.507 --> 02:26:25.343
AND THAT STRESS TEST IS --

02:26:25.409 --> 02:26:27.211
WHETHER OR NOT A SYSTEM HAS A

02:26:27.278 --> 02:26:28.846
NUMBER OF COMPLIMENTS NUMBER ONE

02:26:28.913 --> 02:26:30.214
IS DO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY

02:26:30.281 --> 02:26:31.582
REPELLENTS.

02:26:31.649 --> 02:26:33.251
NUMBER TWO CAN THEY AFFORD

02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:34.752
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:36.053
NUMBER.

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:37.488
THREE CAN THEY RETAIN QUALIFIED

02:26:37.555 --> 02:26:39.323
OPERATORS NUMBER FOUR TWO THEY

02:26:39.390 --> 02:26:40.825
HAVE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND

02:26:40.892 --> 02:26:42.560
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANS.

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:44.228
AND NUMBER FIVE IS CAN INVEST IN

02:26:44.295 --> 02:26:45.496
A SINKING FUND.

02:26:45.563 --> 02:26:47.632
ANY SMALL ORGANIZATION THEY

02:26:47.698 --> 02:26:49.233
CANNOT BEAT THAT STRESS TEST AND

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.902
IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT

02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:53.304
EVEN FOR SOME LARGER SINKING

02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:55.273
FUND THAT'S A BANK ACCOUNT THAT

02:26:55.339 --> 02:26:56.507
REPLACES.

02:26:56.574 --> 02:26:58.075
MONEY FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU

02:26:58.142 --> 02:26:59.510
KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:01.445
REPLACE ADDED AT THE END OF IT

02:27:01.512 --> 02:27:02.246
USABLE LIFE.

02:27:02.313 --> 02:27:03.481
OKAY SO IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF

02:27:03.548 --> 02:27:04.815
MONEY EVERY YEAR BUT IT BUILDS

02:27:04.882 --> 02:27:06.417
UP OVER TIME SO THAT WHEN

02:27:06.484 --> 02:27:07.652
SOMETHING IS READY TO BE

02:27:07.718 --> 02:27:09.220
REPLACED AT TWENTY FIVE YEARS

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:10.855
YOU HAVE THE MONEY.

02:27:10.922 --> 02:27:12.323
IT'S A SUSTAINABILITY FACTOR.

02:27:12.390 --> 02:27:14.392
SO I THINK THOSE REQUIREMENTS

02:27:14.458 --> 02:27:15.826
WILL FORCE IS TO LOOK AT

02:27:15.893 --> 02:27:17.395
ALTERNATE INSTITUTIONAL

02:27:17.461 --> 02:27:20.198
ARRANGEMENTS AND I KNOW THAT A

02:27:20.264 --> 02:27:21.732
LOT OF SMALL SYSTEMS AND ENJOY

02:27:21.799 --> 02:27:23.134
LOCAL CONTROL.

02:27:23.201 --> 02:27:24.268
BUT I THINK SOME OF THE MORE

02:27:24.335 --> 02:27:26.270
SUCCESSFUL ONES HAVE DONE THINGS

02:27:26.337 --> 02:27:27.772
LIKE JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT

02:27:27.838 --> 02:27:28.773
WHERE THEY STILL HAVE THEIR OWN

02:27:28.839 --> 02:27:31.309
BOARD BUT ON COMMON ISSUES.

02:27:31.375 --> 02:27:34.111
OF A LARGE EXPANSE OR PLANNING

02:27:34.178 --> 02:27:36.113
OR RETAINING QUALIFIED PEOPLE

02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:37.848
YOU CAN GET THOSE ORGANIZATIONS

02:27:37.915 --> 02:27:39.016
TO WORK TOGETHER IN THE CASE OF

02:27:39.083 --> 02:27:40.084
THE PRIVATE SIDE.

02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:41.786
IT'S PROBABLY ASSOCIATIONS OF

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:43.721
SOME TYPE SO I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:27:43.788 --> 02:27:45.189
FIND A LOGICAL MANAGEMENT

02:27:45.256 --> 02:27:48.426
PROCESSES FOR VARIOUS AREAS --

02:27:48.492 --> 02:27:50.628
WHO'S IN THOSE AREAS AND ANALYZE

02:27:50.695 --> 02:27:52.163
THEM AND THEN GET THEM TO JOIN

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:54.565
TOGETHER IN A PROCESS THAT WORKS

02:27:54.632 --> 02:27:56.934
FOR ALL OF US -- AN EXAMPLE THAT

02:27:57.001 --> 02:27:59.136
I'VE I'VE WORKED WITH ALREADY

02:27:59.203 --> 02:28:01.038
WAS -- CURSED HAS A HIGH SCHOOL

02:28:01.105 --> 02:28:02.473
YOU SOMEBODY HIGH SCHOOL IT

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.542
JOINED UP WITH HILL VIEW WATER

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:06.344
DISTRICT RECENTLY SO IT'S NO

02:28:06.410 --> 02:28:08.813
LONGER ITS OWN WATER SUPPLIER.

02:28:08.879 --> 02:28:14.652
SIMILARLY THE ONE THAT I WORKED

02:28:14.719 --> 02:28:16.087
ON IN MANTI KANAL GARDEN SCHOOL --

02:28:16.153 --> 02:28:17.255
STILL FINISHING THE FAST PROCESS

02:28:17.321 --> 02:28:18.189
WITH THEM THEY'VE JOINED THE

02:28:18.256 --> 02:28:18.889
STADIUM ANTICA SO WE'VE GOT SOME

02:28:18.956 --> 02:28:19.857
EXAMPLES ARE WORKING ON THIS

02:28:19.924 --> 02:28:22.326
ALREADY -- AND SO WE NEED TO

02:28:22.393 --> 02:28:24.295
CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS PROCESS

02:28:24.362 --> 02:28:26.731
FORWARD LASTLY I HAVE TO ADMIT

02:28:26.797 --> 02:28:28.299
AND SAY WHAT I ALLUDED TO

02:28:28.366 --> 02:28:29.267
EARLIER.

02:28:29.333 --> 02:28:30.268
IS THAT CONTRACTS AND

02:28:30.334 --> 02:28:31.969
DISBURSEMENT ARE STILL TAKING

02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:32.470
TOO LONG.

02:28:32.536 --> 02:28:34.639
IT'S A DIFFICULT PROCESS TO GET

02:28:34.705 --> 02:28:36.841
THROUGH AND ON EVEN AN

02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:39.210
ORGANIZATION LIKE OURS THE WATER

02:28:39.277 --> 02:28:41.212
RESOURCES POLICIES TO STRUGGLES

02:28:41.279 --> 02:28:42.680
TO GET CONTRACTS THROUGH SO THAT

02:28:42.747 --> 02:28:44.715
WE CAN ASSIST WITH GETTING SOME

02:28:44.782 --> 02:28:46.183
OF THESE SMALL SYSTEMS THROUGH

02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:47.652
THE PROCESS SO.

02:28:47.718 --> 02:28:49.053
THAT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT I THINK

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:50.921
EXTERNALLY AS WELL.

02:28:50.988 --> 02:28:58.629

WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS WHERE

02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:46.677
ARE WORSE SPECIFICALLY ENGAGED

MANAGEMENT NETWORK CURRENTLY

02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:41.599
TRYING TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS

02:30:41.665 --> 02:30:43.834
TO GET MONEY.

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:45.703
FOR A SAFE DRINKING WATER.

02:30:45.770 --> 02:30:46.737
WE ALL AGREE THERE SHOULD BE

02:30:46.804 --> 02:30:49.273
MONEY -- QUESTION OF WHO YOU

02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:51.942
TAXED GET AT WHAT SORT OF

02:30:52.009 --> 02:30:53.844
RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO HELP

02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:57.748
WITH THE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT.

02:30:57.815 --> 02:30:59.116
SO.

02:30:59.183 --> 02:31:01.619
IT IS KIND OF YOU KNOW THEY'RE

02:31:01.685 --> 02:31:04.455
THERE AS AS THE SELLERS WAS

02:31:04.522 --> 02:31:05.890
SAYING YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE.

02:31:05.956 --> 02:31:06.624
A RANGE OF DIFFERENT FUNDING

02:31:06.690 --> 02:31:08.426
SOURCES THAT WHAT ONE CAN USE

02:31:08.492 --> 02:31:10.795
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT A HARD

02:31:10.861 --> 02:31:12.997
AND FAST RULE ON WHICH IS RIGHT

02:31:13.063 --> 02:31:14.265
FOR FOR WHICH BUT I'LL GIVE YOU

02:31:14.331 --> 02:31:16.534
MY PHILOSOPHY ABOUT THIS --

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:21.005
WHICH IS THAT -- A LOT OF IS

02:31:21.071 --> 02:31:22.306
THAT WHAT OUR USERS CURRENTLY

02:31:22.373 --> 02:31:24.642
PAY.

02:31:24.708 --> 02:31:26.844
FOR THE MAJORITY OF OF THE

02:31:26.911 --> 02:31:28.612
INVESTMENTS AND THE THE

02:31:28.679 --> 02:31:30.181
OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT FOR

02:31:30.247 --> 02:31:32.616
FOR WATER USE -- AND THE WAY

02:31:32.683 --> 02:31:34.652
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT GROUND

02:31:34.718 --> 02:31:36.187
WATER SUSTAINABILITY AND KIND OF

02:31:36.253 --> 02:31:37.588
ENDING OVERDRAFT WE'VE BEEN

02:31:37.655 --> 02:31:38.556
LOOKING AT IT FROM THE

02:31:38.622 --> 02:31:41.792
PERSPECTIVE OF OF ASSUMING THAT

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:43.994
FARMERS AND AND AND CITIES WHAT

02:31:44.061 --> 02:31:46.197
WILL WILL CONTINUE.

02:31:46.263 --> 02:31:47.865
TO AS THEY HAVE ALREADY TO TO

02:31:47.932 --> 02:31:50.434
PAY FOR FOR THEIR OR THEIR WATER

02:31:50.501 --> 02:31:52.736
SUPPLIES -- AND THE GSA'S AROUND

02:31:52.803 --> 02:31:54.338
OR STAND ABILITY AGENCIES DO

02:31:54.405 --> 02:31:55.306
HAVE.

02:31:55.372 --> 02:31:57.007
THE AUTHORITY THE THE

02:31:57.074 --> 02:31:58.742
LEGISLATION GRIP -- LEGISLATION

02:31:58.809 --> 02:32:02.546
GRANTED THEM THE AUTHORITY TO TO

02:32:02.613 --> 02:32:03.113
RAISE.

02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:04.248
FEES FOR INVESTMENTS I THINK YOU

02:32:04.315 --> 02:32:06.417
KNOW AT THIS POINT MANY OF THEM

02:32:06.484 --> 02:32:06.884
HAVE.

02:32:06.951 --> 02:32:09.687
HAVE BEEN KIND OF FIGURING OUT --

02:32:09.753 --> 02:32:11.522
THERE IN IT IN EARLY DAYS ON

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:12.456
THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL ALSO

02:32:12.523 --> 02:32:13.424
FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THEIR

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:14.859
PROJECTS THAT THEY WANT TO

02:32:14.925 --> 02:32:16.794
INVEST IN BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS

02:32:16.861 --> 02:32:17.728
THAT INCLUDE.

02:32:17.795 --> 02:32:19.396
ASSESSMENTS OF THE LAND WHICH IS

02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:21.031
HOW SOME IRRIGATION DISTRICTS

02:32:21.098 --> 02:32:23.467
ALSO -- RUN YOU KNOW COLLECT

02:32:23.534 --> 02:32:25.436
COLLECT THEIR REVENUES NOW ON

02:32:25.503 --> 02:32:26.971
BUT THERE'S ALSO AN OPTION OF

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:27.571
HAVING A GROUND WATER PUMPING

02:32:27.638 --> 02:32:31.041
FEE THAT COULD BE USED TO TO

02:32:31.108 --> 02:32:33.511
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SO -- WENT IN

02:32:33.577 --> 02:32:34.778
THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE SHOWING

02:32:34.845 --> 02:32:38.249
YOU FOR FOR KIND OF THE QUARTER

02:32:38.315 --> 02:32:39.216
OF SUPPLIES THAT COULD BE.

02:32:39.283 --> 02:32:41.719
AFFORDABLY PAID -- FOR THAT'S

02:32:41.785 --> 02:32:44.021
THAT'S ASSUMING USER USER PAYS

02:32:44.088 --> 02:32:46.690
ON THAT AND IT'S IT TO MY MIND.

02:32:46.757 --> 02:32:47.925
IN A WORLD OF LIMITED STATE

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:50.528
RESOURCES WHERE THE STATE CAN BE

02:32:50.594 --> 02:32:52.029
MOST HELPFUL IS.

02:32:52.096 --> 02:32:55.065
IN AND HELPING TO JUMPSTART.

02:32:55.132 --> 02:32:56.667
INNOVATIONS KIND OF PROVIDING

02:32:56.734 --> 02:32:58.335
INNOVATION FUNDS SORT OF

02:32:58.402 --> 02:32:59.870
SUPPORTING PILOTS THAT WE CAN

02:32:59.937 --> 02:33:02.640
KIND OF CAN HELP GET PEOPLE TO A

02:33:02.706 --> 02:33:04.275
TRYING SOME NEW THINGS BUT THEN

02:33:04.341 --> 02:33:06.410
ALSO FINDING THESE ORPHAN AREAS

02:33:06.477 --> 02:33:06.944
WHERE.

02:33:07.011 --> 02:33:08.546
THERE'S NOT.

02:33:08.612 --> 02:33:10.548
THERE'S NOT THAT KIND OF IT'S

02:33:10.614 --> 02:33:11.782
NOT AS EASY TO GET USER PAY AND

02:33:11.849 --> 02:33:14.251
AND SO THINGS LIKE KIND OF HOW

02:33:14.318 --> 02:33:16.320
TO MANAGE -- HOW TO MANAGE SOME

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:19.089
OF THE THE THE THE LANDS ON HOW

02:33:19.156 --> 02:33:19.657
TO DO SOME OF THE PLANNING

02:33:19.723 --> 02:33:21.659
PROCESS AND SO ON -- ARE AREAS

02:33:21.725 --> 02:33:23.127
WHERE I WOULD.

02:33:23.193 --> 02:33:25.229
I WOULD SORT OF SAYARE ARE KIND

02:33:25.296 --> 02:33:28.132
OF ON THE TOP THE TOP LINE FOR

02:33:28.198 --> 02:33:30.067
FOR STATE FUNDING OKAY -- I

02:33:30.134 --> 02:33:32.536
WOULD SUGGEST IF YOU'VE GOT A

02:33:32.603 --> 02:33:34.738
CONCRETE IDEAS WHICH YOU SEEM TO

02:33:34.805 --> 02:33:39.343
HAVE THAT YOU -- SEND US WELL

02:33:39.410 --> 02:33:41.078
LET'S SEE WE WE DO HAVE.

02:33:41.145 --> 02:33:45.215
HERE IN OUR WATER IN THE FUTURE

02:33:45.282 --> 02:33:47.151
OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

02:33:47.217 --> 02:33:50.921
OVERVIEW AT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY --

02:33:50.988 --> 02:33:53.257
I'VE GOT THE OVERVIEW SECTION

02:33:53.324 --> 02:33:55.593
HERE THE FIRST SIXTEEN PAGES --

02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:57.761
IS THERE INFORMATION ON SPECIFIC

02:33:57.828 --> 02:33:59.730
PROPOSALS IN THIS THAT WE WOULD

02:33:59.797 --> 02:34:00.864
HAVE AN IDEA WHAT'S IN THE

02:34:00.931 --> 02:34:04.768
LEGISLATION MIGHT BE NECESSARY.

02:34:04.835 --> 02:34:06.904
THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME.

02:34:06.971 --> 02:34:09.473
IS SOME DIRECTIONS ON ON THINK

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.408
AREAS WHERE THE STATE CAN BE

02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:12.943
VERY VERY HELPFUL WE HAVEN'T

02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:14.678
GONE TO THE LEVEL OF VERY

02:34:14.745 --> 02:34:17.081
SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

02:34:17.147 --> 02:34:18.649
AND AND CERTAINLY NOT TO THE ON

02:34:18.716 --> 02:34:20.584
THE ISSUE OF FUNDING WE COULD WE

02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:22.720
COULD.

02:34:22.786 --> 02:34:25.456
THERE ARE SOME OF THAT OUT LOOK.

02:34:25.522 --> 02:34:26.590
NONE OF US.

02:34:26.657 --> 02:34:29.460
LEGISLATORS ARE EXPERTS.

02:34:29.526 --> 02:34:32.062
AND WHILE WE HAVE STAFF WHO ARE

02:34:32.129 --> 02:34:34.732
MUCH MORE EXPERT THAN WE ARE --

02:34:34.798 --> 02:34:36.600
IT WOULD REALLY HELP TO HAVE

02:34:36.667 --> 02:34:39.069
SOME CONCRETE -- RECOMMENDATIONS

02:34:39.136 --> 02:34:41.205
AND I WOULD SAY THAT. TO ALL

02:34:41.271 --> 02:34:43.073
THREE OF YOU -- IF YOU COULD

02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:45.109
GIVE US CONCRETE REPRESENTATION

02:34:45.175 --> 02:34:47.378
WE NEED A LAW TO DO ARE WE NEED

02:34:47.444 --> 02:34:48.846
APPROPRIATIONS.

02:34:48.912 --> 02:34:50.614
FOR AND YOU COULD SEND THAT TO

02:34:50.681 --> 02:34:56.954
MYSELF AND CHAIRED GARCIA -- AND

02:34:57.021 --> 02:34:59.390
TO OUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND WE

02:34:59.456 --> 02:35:00.724
CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT FOR NEXT

02:35:00.791 --> 02:35:02.459
YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER AND SEE

02:35:02.526 --> 02:35:03.861
WHAT WE CAN DO.

02:35:03.927 --> 02:35:05.996
BUT THE KEY TO HELP US ROUTE

02:35:06.063 --> 02:35:08.699
REALLY HELP TO GET DOWN TO VERY

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:11.935
CONCRETE PROPOSALS -- IT'S GREAT

02:35:12.002 --> 02:35:15.105
TO HAVE THIS -- OVERVIEW.

02:35:15.172 --> 02:35:18.075
BUT TO HAVE A CONCRETE PROPOSAL

02:35:18.142 --> 02:35:20.077
REALLY HELPS GET OUR MINDS ON

02:35:20.144 --> 02:35:22.513
THE ISSUE HOW MUCH WE CAN DO.

02:35:22.579 --> 02:35:24.348
I DON'T KNOW BUT IT WOULD REALLY

02:35:24.415 --> 02:35:26.684
HELP AND WE DEFINITELY DO WANT

02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:28.218
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:35:28.285 --> 02:35:30.054
THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT HAS TO

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:34.825
BE FOLLOWED -- TO BE -- TO HELP.

02:35:34.892 --> 02:35:36.727
GET SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER

02:35:36.794 --> 02:35:38.128
WHICH IS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST

02:35:38.195 --> 02:35:39.496
IN THE LONG RUN.

02:35:39.563 --> 02:35:41.598
A TO MINIMIZE THAT'D BE GREAT

02:35:41.665 --> 02:35:44.668
AND THAT YOU'RE SAYING REQUIRES

02:35:44.735 --> 02:35:47.938
SOME STATE LEADERSHIP -- IT WAS --

02:35:48.005 --> 02:35:50.641
WE HAD A REAL PROBLEM IN IT YEAH

02:35:50.708 --> 02:35:51.542
I WOULD SAY THAT.

02:35:51.608 --> 02:35:53.043
THIS GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT

02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:54.945
PLAN WAS PASSED BY PEOPLE FROM

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:55.979
CITIES.

02:35:56.046 --> 02:35:57.681
NOT FROM THE AREAS WHO ARE

02:35:57.748 --> 02:36:00.317
ACTUALLY BEING AFFECTED -- THEY

02:36:00.384 --> 02:36:02.486
DO NOT WANT TO TAKE.

02:36:02.553 --> 02:36:07.591
TAKE THE PAIN OF NOT -- OF

02:36:07.658 --> 02:36:09.293
TRYING TO MANAGE THEIR GROUND

02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:10.260
WATER.

02:36:10.327 --> 02:36:11.595
IT WAS A REAL SHAME THAT IT WAS

02:36:11.662 --> 02:36:13.297
DONE THAT WAY BUT THAT WAS THE

02:36:13.363 --> 02:36:14.431
WAY IT WAS ONE.

02:36:14.498 --> 02:36:16.800
AT ANY RATE -- WE REALLY DO NEED

02:36:16.867 --> 02:36:19.036
CONCRETE PROPOSALS AND HOW WE

02:36:19.103 --> 02:36:21.839
HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN. ONE OF

02:36:21.905 --> 02:36:23.607
THE CONCRETE PROPOSALS WE COULD

02:36:23.674 --> 02:36:26.343
POSSIBLY RECOMMEND IS THERE IS.

02:36:26.410 --> 02:36:28.312
A PROBLEM WE CALL CONNECTIVITY

02:36:28.378 --> 02:36:30.981
AND THAT IS A LOT OF THE LEGACY

02:36:31.048 --> 02:36:33.784
OLDER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE WATER.

02:36:33.851 --> 02:36:36.053
ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONNECTED

02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:37.421
WELL TO THE RECHARGE AREAS.

02:36:37.488 --> 02:36:38.322
SO THERE'S SOME PLANNING STUDIES

02:36:38.388 --> 02:36:40.557
THAT NEED TO BE DONE THAT COULD

02:36:40.624 --> 02:36:43.293
HELP TO ACTUALLY DEVISE A PLAN

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:44.995
TO IMPROVE THOSE SITUATIONS.

02:36:45.062 --> 02:36:46.997
SO THAT WAS ONE AREA PERHAPS AND

02:36:47.064 --> 02:36:49.366
WE DID DISCUSS THAT IN IN THE

02:36:49.433 --> 02:36:49.600
PROCESS.

02:36:49.666 --> 02:36:50.934
THAT WE NEED.

02:36:51.001 --> 02:36:52.269
TO DIG FURTHER INTO THAT ONE AND

02:36:52.336 --> 02:36:54.438
ERIC SO AGAIN THE MORE CONCRETE

02:36:54.505 --> 02:36:56.840
YOU CAN MAKE IT THE MORE HELPFUL

02:36:56.907 --> 02:37:01.111
IT IS TO US THANK YOU.

02:37:01.178 --> 02:37:02.613
I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I DO

02:37:02.679 --> 02:37:05.482
WANT TO JUST UP AND KNOWLEDGE OF

02:37:05.549 --> 02:37:07.951
THE DISCUSSIONS THAT -- MISS

02:37:08.018 --> 02:37:08.952
GREENE.

02:37:09.019 --> 02:37:11.388
PUTS FORWARD THAT IS A VERY REAL

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:16.527

THAT THERE'S A STREAM OF FUNDING

02:37:23.567 --> 02:37:24.701
GOING.

02:37:24.768 --> 02:37:26.336
TO ADD THIS NEED ON A

02:37:26.403 --> 02:37:27.738
REOCCURRING BASIS.

02:37:27.805 --> 02:37:28.972
THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSALS OUT

THERE ATTEMPTING TO DO THE SAME

02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:34.812
THING -- BECAUSE THERE'S OVER

02:37:34.878 --> 02:37:36.046
MILLION PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE

02:37:36.113 --> 02:37:37.881

AND YOU'VE POINTED OUT SOME OF

02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:41.652

PREVALENT.

02:37:42.786 --> 02:37:44.621
THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT.

02:37:44.688 --> 02:37:47.558
ARE NOT AS I GUESS POINTED OUT

02:37:47.624 --> 02:37:49.793

THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE -- I THINK.

02:38:15.285 --> 02:38:17.354
WHO ARE ARE KIND OF COLLECTIVE

02:38:17.421 --> 02:38:18.956
THINKING ON THIS IS THAT THE

02:38:19.022 --> 02:38:20.424
FUNDING THE FUNDING IS AN

02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:22.326
ESSENTIAL PIECE?

02:38:22.392 --> 02:38:24.528
BUT RIGHT NOW THE WAY WERE

02:38:24.595 --> 02:38:25.963
DRESSING.

GOING FAST ENOUGH I EITHER SO.

02:38:38.909 --> 02:38:40.344
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT.

02:38:40.410 --> 02:38:41.912
THE LEGISLATURE COULD HELP IT

02:38:41.979 --> 02:38:46.683
YOU. TO TO TO KIND OF OF

02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:50.187
ENCOURAGE THE ADOPTION OF A OF A
