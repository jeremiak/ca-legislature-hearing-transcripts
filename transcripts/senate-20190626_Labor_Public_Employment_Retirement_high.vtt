NINE I LIKE FORTY THOUSAND

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:24.003
FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

THROUGHOUT THE STATE PORK

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:28.207
COUNTLESS HOURS NURTURING AND

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:29.441

TODDLERS AND SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN

I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT MY WORK

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.581
BECAUSE EVERY DAY I GET TO HELP

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.750
OUR YOUNGEST MOST VULNERABLE

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:38.918
CHILDREN THE FILL THEIR

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:39.885
POTENTIAL.

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:41.587
BUT THERE IS A TROUBLE INSIDE TO

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.889
CHILD CARE BEYOND DIRTY DIAPERS

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:46.859
AND TEMPER TANTRUMS MANY DON'T

00:13:46.926 --> 00:13:47.927
SEE.

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.728
WHILE I SUPPORT WORKING PARENTS

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:50.629
VERY STRONGLY SO THEY CAN

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.865

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:53.365
FOR THEIR MOST VALUABLE

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.600
TREASURES.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.902
THEIR CHILDREN I ALSO STRUGGLE

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:58.904
WITH POVERTY WAGES.

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:00.739
THIS DECISION MAKERS SAY I DO

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:03.142
VALUABLE WORK BUT THE LAW AND MY

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.977
REALITY SAY OTHERWISE.

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:06.512
THE LAW MAKES PROVIDERS BILL

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:08.414
DISPOSABLE.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.915
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT WORTHY OF

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.517
BASIC PROTECTIONS LIKE THE

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:13.118

IN THE WORLD YES I DO NOT EARN A

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:23.996
LIVING WAGE INSTEAD AT SOME

POINTS PROVIDERS CAN QUALIFY FOR

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:27.967
THE SAME CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.235
THAT I PROVIDE.

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:31.136
CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE HAVE

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.205
DIRE CONSEQUENCES AND THEY DID

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.975
FOR ME AND TWO THOUSAND NINE I

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.209
WAS CLOSE TO LOSING MY HOME.

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:38.844
BECAUSE I WAS NOT BEING PAID ON

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:41.180
TIME AND SUFFER FROM LOW

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:42.881
ENROLLMENT WHILE LOSE SOMEONE'S

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:44.316
HOME IS HARD ENOUGH FOR A FAMILY

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:47.286
CHILDCARE PROVIDER IT IS

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.320
COMPLETELY TRAUMATIC.

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:49.655

LIVELIHOOD AND DEPRIVE OUR EARLY

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.228

MY STORY IS ONE OF MANY AND A

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:00.132

IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:02.393
THERE IS NO CHILD CARE WITHOUT A

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.661
CHILD CARE WORKER.

00:31:03.728 --> 00:31:05.330
AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:08.399
NEED OF CHILD CARE FOR OUR STATE

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.068
WHICH WE KNOW IS.

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:12.503
REALLY SOMETHING THAT I'M ALL OF

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.439
CALIFORNIA NEEDS WE KNOW THAT WE

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:16.040
HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE

00:31:16.107 --> 00:31:18.276
WORKERS IT IS NOT OKAY FOR

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:21.145
WORKERS TO BE PAID.

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:21.713
LESS THAN WHAT A FAST FOOD

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:23.748
WORKER MAKES IT IS NOT OKAY FOR

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.650

MINIMUM WAGE WITH.

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:27.585
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:29.187
FIGHTING FOR SO WE SEE A

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:31.122
STRONGER WORKFORCE THAT WILL

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:32.724
HELP CHILD CARE ALTOGETHER WE

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.692
SEE IT -- A WORK FORCE THAT

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:36.494
REALLY CAN BECOME A PROFESSION

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:39.364
WHERE THOSE WHO SERVE WILL NOT

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.666
BE USING THE SAME SUBSIDIES --

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.835
OF THE STUDENTS THAT THEY SEE IN

00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:45.003
ARE THE KIDS THAT THEY SEE IN

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:46.471
THE CHILD CARE SPACE OF THIS IS

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.406
REALLY ABOUT STRENGTHENING THE

00:31:48.473 --> 00:31:50.074
WORKER WHICH IN TURN STRENGTHENS

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:53.244
CHILD KERR ALTOGETHER IN

00:31:57.315 --> 00:31:59.384
COULD YOU GOING HELLO YEAH SO I

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.618
THINK THERE'S A THIRD PARTY ON

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:03.187
ERROR ON BEHALF OF YOUR D. W. AN

00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:03.688
S. C. ARE YOU.

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:04.455
THERE THERE SEEMS TO BE A DIRECT

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:06.457
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN.

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:07.859
A QUE RIGHT WAGES ARMED

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:08.893
REGARDING BENEFITS AND THINGS

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.994
LIKE THAT TO THE PEOPLE CAN TAKE

00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:11.262
CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES -- AND

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:12.964
THERE'S ALSO A RELATIONSHIP TO

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:13.898
THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT'S

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:16.968
PROVIDED OKAY -- A YOUNG TO IN

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:17.802
THAT LINKS TO THE TRAINING THAT

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:19.504
WORKERS ARE PROVIDED.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.039
AND RIGHT NOW I'M WORKERS HAVE

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:22.507
VERY LITTLE ACCESS TO TRAINING

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:23.741
EXCEPT THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:24.942
THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:29.547
TO GET A LICENSE FOR EXAMPLE ALL

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:30.148
RIGHT.

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:30.715
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:31.816
REQUIRING NOW THAT THERE BE MORE

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:33.584
TRAINING NOT ONLY FOR LICENSED

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:34.218
PROVIDERS THAT OFFER FROM WHAT

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:34.819
ALSO FOR WHAT WE CALL LICENSE

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:35.887
EXEMPT PROVIDERS WHICH ARE

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:36.487
FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:37.355
BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:38.890
VERY CLEARLY SAYS PARENTS HAVE

00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:40.658
THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHO TAKES

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:41.559
CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN.

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.127
RIGHT WHEN I DON'T GET THE RIGHT

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:44.329
TO TELL THEM WHO THAT IS THEY

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:45.930
GET TO CHOOSE AND SO WE PROVIDE

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:47.999
A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WE CALL

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:48.566
IT.

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:49.734
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.436
RIGHT IN RECOGNIZING THE VALUE

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:53.071
OF THE PROVIDER OF THE PEOPLE

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:54.405
WHO PROVIDE THE CARE?

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:56.174
IS ALSO TO SAY RIGHT THROUGH WE

STATE PAYS SUBSIDY ALL RIGHT.

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:10.555
BUT IT'S OUT OF RESPECT THAT YOU

SIT AND HAVE A CONVERSATION SO

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:13.424

RIGHT -- BUT ALSO TO LOOK AT

00:33:27.438 --> 00:33:28.005
WHAT ARE THE TRAINING NEED TO

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:29.307
THE PROVIDERS THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:30.942
ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE AS THEIR

00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:31.776
TRAINING NEEDS.

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:32.877
VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE EVER BEEN

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:35.213
ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU NEED

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.547
IN ORDER TO BECOME -- AND PROVE

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:38.616
PROVIDER RIGHT SOMEBODY WHO

ACTUALLY HAS AND IT HAS A

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:41.219
BACKGROUND IN EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:42.987
EDUCATION HAS A CLUE TO WHAT

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:44.122
THEY'RE DOING ALSO HAS A WAY OF

00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:45.590
PROTECTING THEMSELVES ONE OF THE

00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:46.357
THINGS THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:47.392
INVOLVED IN LATELY IS

00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:48.760
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:49.827
ISSUES.

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:50.862
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN VERY

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:51.996
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:53.464
KIDS RIGHT RIGHTFULLY SO THAT'S

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:54.966
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS ABOUT

00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:56.167
THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY.

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:57.435
BUT IN ORDER FOR US TO BE SURE

00:33:57.502 --> 00:33:59.003
THAT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY IS

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.338
PROTECTED WE NEED TO BE SURE

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:01.172
THAT THE WORKERS WHO PROVIDE THE

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:02.740
CARE OF THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:04.075
IS PROTECTED AS WELL AND SO

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:05.243
WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:06.010
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:07.912
TRAINING. TO OUR PROVIDERS THEY

00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:09.914
LOVE IT OKAY ONE OF THE REASONS

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.215
THAT THEY LOVE IT.

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:12.083
IS BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO BE

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.252
TRAINED BY THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:15.853
WORK AS WELL AND SO THE USE CARE

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.255
TRAINERS THAT KIND OF THING SO

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:18.756
THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF IDEAS THAT

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:19.991
PROVIDERS HAVE THAT HAVE NEVER

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:21.192
BEEN ASKED.

00:34:21.259 --> 00:34:22.026
RIGHT WHAT DO THEY THINK SHOULD

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:23.327
HAPPEN HOW THEY THINK THEY

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:24.962
SHOULD BE TRAINED WHAT DO THEY

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:26.564
WANT RIGHT TO SOME OF THEM.

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:28.065
JUST WANT TO HAVE JUST WANT TO

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.300
HAVE THE VERY BASIC TRAINING

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:30.535
OKAY OTHERS WANT TO HAVE

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.737
POSSIBLY IN A A DEGREE SOME

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:34.172
PEOPLE WANT TO GO WANT TO BE A

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:36.274
HAVE A BACHELOR'S RIGHT AS ART

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.177
YES OUR PRINTER TESTIFIED -- BUT

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.111
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED THIS IS

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:41.579
AN OPPORTUNITY WE BELIEVE A

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.046
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:44.115
CONVERSATION. TO FIND OUT WHAT

00:34:44.182 --> 00:34:44.916
THE PROVIDERS THINK THAT THEY

00:34:44.982 --> 00:34:45.116
NEED.

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:46.417
I'M ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TO

00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:54.892
REALIZE WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:55.493
THE CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.195
THAT WE I'D SERVICES.

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.196
TO AND WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO

00:34:58.262 --> 00:34:59.197
THE PUBLIC IN REGARDS TO

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:00.431
WHATEVER LEGISLATION IS PASSED

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:01.766
WHAT YOU ALL THINK OUR

00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:02.867
REQUIREMENTS WELL.

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:03.534
SO BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:04.135
IT'S ALL ABOUT IN THE END IS

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:04.902
IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF CARE

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:06.304
FOR KIDS. TO MAKE THEM

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:06.971
PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS RIGHT I MEAN

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:08.005
THAT'S THE KIND OF THE BOTTOM

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:09.540
LINE THAT I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:10.508
INVOLVED WITH FOR A LONG TIME.

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:11.075
THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT I WAS

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:14.045
HOPING MY ONLY OTHER QUESTION IS --

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:15.613
WE NEED TO PAY THERE'S BEEN A

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.948

YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT DOESN'T

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:42.673
QUITE HAPPEN -- BUT SO WE ARE

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.941
GOING TO VALUE BY BY THIS

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:46.043
PROCESS CREATE GREATER VALUE TO

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.712
THE PEOPLE DOING THE SERVICES

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:48.746
AND GREATER VALUE TO THE

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:52.917
CHILDREN THROUGH TRAINING AND

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:54.285
AND RESPECT AS YOU SAY.

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:55.286
THE COST SO WE KNOW THAT

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:56.787
PROVIDING CHILDCARE TODAY

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:59.190
WHETHER IT'S SUBSIDIZED CARE OR

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:00.324
WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE'S PAYING

00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:01.492
THEIR OWN CARE.

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:04.161
IS IT IS I WOULD SAY OWNERS BUT

00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:05.496
IT IS CHALLENGING.

00:36:05.563 --> 00:36:07.064
HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THE

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:08.699
FACT THAT YES INDEED THE COST

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:10.268
MAY GO UP BECAUSE YOU KNOW GOD

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:11.402
FORBID WE'RE GOING TO PAY THE?

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:12.970
PEOPLE ARE DOING THE JOB MORE

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:15.139
THAN SLAVE WAGES HOW DO WE

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:17.174
ADDRESS HOW DO YOU ENVISION US

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:19.944
ADDRESSING THAT PROBLEM GOING

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:25.816
FORWARD. ONE IS.

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.618
THIRTY ONE IT'S AN EASY QUESTION

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:28.920
I KNOW RIGHT RIGHT YEAH BECAUSE

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:29.554
THERE THERE ARE TWO ISSUES HERE

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.188
RIGHT ONE IS IS THE RATE MAKING

00:36:31.255 --> 00:36:32.023
THE RATE STRUCTURE OKAY AND WE

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:33.224
HAVE A VERY COMPLICATED RATE

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:35.126
STRUCTURE THAT WE WILL GO INTO

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:36.494
TODAY BECAUSE I BECAUSE ALL YOU

00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:36.928
DO WAS SCREAM.

00:36:36.994 --> 00:36:37.962
AT US AND SAY YOU'VE GOT TO BE

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.230
JOKING THAT IS IT'S TOO

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:40.998
COMPLICATED FOR US TO UNDERSTAND

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:43.768
DO IT DO IT SIMPLER YOU WANT.

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:46.037
ME TO COMPLICATE WE MAKE ME MAD

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:47.438
YES NO.

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:48.205
RIGHT AND THERE'S A BILL MOVING

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:49.407
THROUGH THAT WE HOPE WILL

00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:50.641
SIMPLIFY THAT RATE STRUCTURE

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:52.276
OKAY -- HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH

00:36:52.343 --> 00:36:53.911
MORE MONEY IS NEEDED OKAY AND SO

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:55.012
THE QUESTION BECOMES AND NOT

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.080
ONLY DOES THE MORE MONEY NEED

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.014
FOR THE WAGES FOR THE PEOPLE

00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:57.582
THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM.

00:36:57.648 --> 00:36:59.483
WE HAVE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.885
CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:07.325
ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES AND ARE

00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:08.993
NOT RECEIVING THEM.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.660
OKAY WE'RE NOT EVEN I'M NOT EVEN

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:10.294
TALKING ABOUT UNIVERSALITY FOR

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:10.895
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION I'M

00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:12.263
JUST TALKING ABOUT LOW INCOME

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.331
FAMILIES WHO WHO WHO IF THERE

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:13.731
WAS ENOUGH MONEY.

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:14.365
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:16.367
TODAY THAT MEANS OF THEIR

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:17.835
FAMILIES ARE EITHER STRUGGLING

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:18.936
THERE EITHER NOT WORKING OKAY

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:20.338
WHEN THEY COULD BE WORKING.

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:21.572
OR THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:22.740
OUT HOW TO DO THIS OR THEY HAVE

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.742
THEIR GRANDPARENTS OR THEY HAVE

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:28.446
A FRIEND OR WHATEVER.

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:29.614
CHILDREN ARE AT HOME ALONE RIGHT

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.449
THE TERM THAT WE'VE USED FOR

00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:31.949
YEARS AS LATCHKEY KIDS.

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:33.217
THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:34.752
PROPOSITION -- RIGHT WHEN YOU

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:36.520
HAVE CHILDREN STAYING AT HOME BY

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:36.954
THEMSELVES.

00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:38.456
I'M I DON'T WANT TO USE THE

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:39.423
ANALOGY BUT WE JUST BEEN READING

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.026
ABOUT IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF

TEXAS ARE.

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:46.864
BUT IT IS A PRETTY GOOD ANALOGY

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:49.200
OF KIDS TAKING CARE OF KIDS OKAY.

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:50.801
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:51.335
FIGURE OUT IN IN THE UNION

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:51.936

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.408
TO NEED A PERMANENT REVENUE

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.643
STREAM YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:00.811

EASY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.653
EDUCATION YOU PAY FOR DOWN THE

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:10.221
ROAD OKAY YOU FIRST OF ALL HAVE

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:12.616
THE REASON WHY I BRING UP THE

MANDATORY OVERTIME.

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:15.619
IS BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:17.287

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:09.446
PROBLEM AND SO AND SO HOW MANY

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:11.014

SO CERTAIN FACILITIES HAVE A

00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:29.633
MORE DIFFICULT THAN OTHERS LIKE

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.702
ATASCADERO AND COOLING TO HAVE A

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:35.305
VERY TOUGH TIME -- THIS IS.

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:36.073
STAFFING THEIR FACILITIES

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:36.840
HOWEVER THEY'RE NOT THE FACILITY

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:38.875
THAT HAS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OVER

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:40.344
TIME.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.080

AT 19%.

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:53.890
THAT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:56.626

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:03.633
THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BUT

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.036
STAFF STAFFING IN THE LA AREA IS

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:06.870
VERY EASY.

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.305
STAFFING ON THE CENTRAL COAST IS

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:10.207
VERY HARD WHERE IT'S INCREDIBLY

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:15.178
EXPENSIVE -- AND SO FORTH -- AND

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:16.513
THEN CENTRAL VALLEY LET BUT IN

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.314
THOSE AREAS WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:18.782
TO STAFF THEY'RE NOT HAVING THE

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:19.383
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH OVER

00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:19.850
TIME RIGHT SO ARE ARE

00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:21.385
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH OVERTIME

WHERE THE VACANCY RATES ARE

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:31.128
INCREDIBLY LOW IT'S BASED ON SO

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.162
THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THE

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:33.330
INCREDIBLY HIGH.

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.765
I MEAN GRANTED THERE'S THERE'S

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:36.867
HIGH OVERTIME EVERYWHERE RIGHT

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:40.170
BUT THE MANDATORY OVERTIME IS

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:40.937
GENERALLY SEEN AT NAPA.

00:50:41.004 --> 00:50:42.806
AND THAT'S A MANAGEMENT ISSUE

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:44.341
IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF OKAY AND

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:47.711
AND AND AND I WOULD LIKE THAT I

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:48.078
THINK WHEN YOU.

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:48.712
ARE PLANNING EXACTLY AND I WOULD

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:50.247

POSITIONS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:58.355
THAT WILL VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE.

00:50:58.422 --> 00:50:59.990
THE MANDATORY OVERTIME AND AND

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.625
SO THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.760
THIS PRACTICE SHOULD AND TO

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:05.395

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:41.363
THAT WILL COMPROMISE.

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:42.664
ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.165
INTERESTS.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:47.302
UP FOR CALIFORNIANS.

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:48.770
SO I WILL NEVER TAKE A MEASURE

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:50.438
OF WHICH A MEASURE OF FORWARD.

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:52.574
THAT WILL COMPROMISE

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:54.876
CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST OR

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:55.977
CALIFORNIANS INTEREST.

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:56.745
HAVING SAID THAT.

01:21:56.811 --> 01:22:00.849
THIS IS A EXTREMELY WELL

01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:01.616
PROTECTED.

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:03.985
EVERY AT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:05.487
OVER THE FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.589

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:08.556
EVERY COMMITTEE IT'S GONE

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:09.958

AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.463
THAT IT WILL NEVER CAUSE DAMAGE.

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:16.765
TO THE BOTTOM LINE INTEREST

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:18.466
WHICH IS STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:21.836
OUR RESIDENTS.

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.838
IN ORDER FOR THIS BILL.

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.040
IF IT'S PASSED AND SIGNED INTO

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:29.911
LAW. TO ACTUALLY TAKE A FACT.

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:31.880
A FEDERAL ACTION WILL HAVE TO BE

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:33.748
TAKEN.

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:35.517
AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:36.751
WHICH IN ITSELF [inaudible]

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:38.720
IS [inaudible]

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.355
A LOT.

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:42.590
PRETTY LARGE TASK.

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:44.926
BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEN AS AN ALLY.

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:49.597
IN THE REGION.

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:52.500
SO FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:53.034
THAT'S A BIT OF A STRETCH

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:54.703
ALREADY.

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:57.205
EVEN SHOULD THAT HAPPEN.

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:59.107
THE LANGUAGE IS VERY SPECIFIC AS

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:01.543
TO WHAT KIND OF ACTION.

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.745
AND THE ACTION IS GOING TO BE

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.413
ALONG THE LINES OF IF.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.148
HE DOES NOT.

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:08.750
RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.885
SAID IT'S NOT JUST ANY FEDERAL

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:12.187
ACTION.

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:16.224
PRESCRIPTIVE TO SPECIFIC ISSUE.

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:19.761
IF IF THOSE TWO ITEMS.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.397
ARE OVERCOME AT THAT POINT.

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.199
CALPERS AND CAL STAR STILL HAVE

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.434
THE AUTHORITY. TO SAY THAT THEY

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:28.937
WILL NOT GO AHEAD AND IMPLEMENT.

01:23:29.003 --> 01:23:29.904
BECAUSE OF FIDUCIARY

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:32.374
RESPONSIBILITY.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.709
SO I KNOW THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:37.112
BREAK GO AGAINST THE GOVERNOR

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:38.113
NOR.

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:39.748
NOR THE LEGISLATURE FOR AN ACT

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:42.350
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN. TO RESERVE

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:43.685
THAT RIGHT.

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:47.088
SO GIVEN ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:47.389
[inaudible]

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:48.957
GUARD RAILS.

01:23:49.023 --> 01:23:50.191
SECURING THE INTEREST OF

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:54.396
CALIFORNIANS -- THIS IS MORE OF

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:57.565
A MESSAGE A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE.

01:23:57.632 --> 01:23:59.567

01:23:59.634 --> 01:24:01.770
LATER HUNDRED AND FOUR YEARS

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:02.704

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:05.907
CALIFORNIAHAS NOT FORGOTTEN.

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:08.143
ASIDE FROM PASSING THE ANNUAL

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.978
RESOLUTION THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:11.980
FOR THE PAST. TWENTY FIVE YEARS

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:13.782
PLUS.

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:14.916
THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:16.785
NEXT STEP.

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:19.087
IN ENSURING WHAT IN HUMAN HOW WE

01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:21.890
ADDRESS AS A SOCIETY AS A

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:23.792
CIVILIZATION AS A STATE.

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:26.194
MAN'S INHUMANITY TO MAN.

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.829
NOW IF THE WORLD HAD COME TO A

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.097
CONCLUSION IF THE WORLD

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:31.399
COMMUNITY I'VE TAKEN STEPS TO

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:32.934
HOLD TURKEY ACCOUNTABLE.

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:35.637
WE MAY HAVE NOT SEEN WHAT'S

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:37.138
HAPPENING IN TURKEY TODAY.

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:40.341
BECAUSE THE WEST DID INVEST IN

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:41.843
TURKEY AFTER WORLD WAR.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:42.911
ONE THE POINT WHERE IT HAS

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:45.280
BECOME A TOP TWENTY FIVE GDP

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:47.182
WORLD CONTENDER.

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:49.451
AND IS SPIRALING DOWN NOW.

01:24:49.517 --> 01:24:51.119
BECAUSE THE CURRENT REGIME IS

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:53.221
TRYING TO GO BACK RATHER THAN

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:55.223
MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REFORMS.

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:57.025
ACCOUNTABILITY IS OF GOOD.

01:24:57.091 --> 01:24:59.294
COMPETITION IS A GOOD THING WE

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.962
ALL ESPOUSE THESE IDEAS.

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:03.231
THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN DOING

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:05.567
EXACTLY THAT AT A MORE LEVEL.

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.001
THIS WILL THIS BILL WILL NOT BE

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:08.503
IMPLEMENTED.

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.205
I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'LL EVER

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:11.773
BE IMPLEMENTED BUT IT WILL.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.808
ALWAYS BE IN THE BOOKS IF IT

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.243
PASSES AND IT'S SIGN.

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:16.945

HAVING COME OUT FOR THE

02:07:13.125 --> 02:07:14.426
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE --

02:07:14.493 --> 02:07:16.528
AND WE RESPECTFULLY ARE OPPOSED

02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:17.463
TO THIS BILL I THINK WE HAVE

02:07:17.529 --> 02:07:19.164
SOME FUNDAMENTAL PHILOSOPHICAL

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:21.533
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER THIS

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:22.601
IS THE RIGHT APPROACH WE WANT.

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:23.702
TO CONVINCE BUSINESSES THE SAME

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:24.870
CALIFORNIA WE THINK WOULD BE

02:07:24.937 --> 02:07:26.939
MORE PRODUCTIVE TO HAVE A

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:27.973
CONVERSATION ABOUT.

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.108
POTENTIALLY REDUCING SOME OF THE

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:30.509
REGULATORY BURDEN ON A

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:31.677
BUSINESSES.

02:07:31.744 --> 02:07:33.579
WE WANT TO KEEP THEM HERE RATHER

02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:35.214
THAN A PUNITIVE APPROACH.

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:37.016
WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THIS

02:07:37.082 --> 02:07:38.450
BILL'S IMPACT ON ATTRACTING

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:40.052
FUTURE CALL CENTER JOBS THE

02:07:40.119 --> 02:07:41.420
CALIFORNIA AND THESE CAN BE VERY

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.688
DIFFICULT FOR A COMPANY TO

02:07:42.755 --> 02:07:43.322
CONSIDER.

02:07:43.389 --> 02:07:45.457
CREATING A NEW CALL CENTER IN

02:07:45.524 --> 02:07:46.792
CALIFORNIA IF THEY THIS BILL

02:07:46.859 --> 02:07:47.893
GOES INTO EFFECT WHEN THEY SEE

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.228
THE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS IF

02:07:49.294 --> 02:07:50.262
IN THE FUTURE THEY MAKE A

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:53.832
DECISION TO LEAVE SO WE THINK

02:07:53.899 --> 02:07:54.833
IT'S GONNA IMPACT JOBS IN THAT

02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:55.134
[inaudible]

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.602
LEVEL.

02:07:56.668 --> 02:07:57.536
SO DESPITE OUR FUNDAMENTAL

02:07:57.603 --> 02:07:58.237
OPPOSITION WE TRY TO ENGAGE

02:07:58.303 --> 02:07:59.171
OFFERS ALL AUTHORS OFFICE AND

02:07:59.238 --> 02:08:00.472
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT

02:08:00.539 --> 02:08:01.840
AMENDMENTS AND DOCTORS OFFICES

02:08:01.907 --> 02:08:02.708
BEEN.

02:08:02.775 --> 02:08:03.976
VERY GRACIOUS IN A MEETING WITH

02:08:04.043 --> 02:08:05.744
US AND WE APPRECIATE THE

02:08:05.811 --> 02:08:06.311
AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THE

02:08:06.378 --> 02:08:07.212
AUTHOR HAS.

02:08:07.279 --> 02:08:09.248
TAKEN US FAR WE HAVE A COUPLE OF

02:08:09.314 --> 02:08:11.550
ADDITIONAL CONCERNS.

02:08:11.617 --> 02:08:13.218
WE THINK THE NOTICE PROVISIONS

02:08:13.285 --> 02:08:15.087
IN THE BILL SHOULD BE LIMITED TO

02:08:15.154 --> 02:08:16.188
SIXTY DAYS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH

02:08:16.255 --> 02:08:18.290
THE WARN ACT WHICH IS A SIXTY

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:19.525
DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT.

02:08:19.591 --> 02:08:21.627
THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS OF THE TAX

02:08:21.693 --> 02:08:23.228
CREDIT PROVISION.

02:08:23.295 --> 02:08:24.496
DOES NOT HAVE A NEXUS TO TAX

02:08:24.563 --> 02:08:26.065
CREDITS CENTER FOR JOB CREATION

02:08:26.131 --> 02:08:27.800
OR OPERATIONS OF THE CALL CENTER

02:08:27.866 --> 02:08:29.635
AND SO YOU COULD HAVE A LARGE

02:08:29.701 --> 02:08:32.237
COMPANY THAT HAS -- ONE CALL

02:08:32.304 --> 02:08:34.440
CENTER FOR ONE DIVISION -- AND

02:08:34.506 --> 02:08:35.274
THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL

02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:36.775
WOULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT TAX

02:08:36.842 --> 02:08:38.777
CREDITS AT A COMPLETELY SEPARATE

02:08:38.844 --> 02:08:40.412
PART OF THE COMPANY RECEIVES.

02:08:40.479 --> 02:08:41.647
TAX CREDITS THAT MAY BE USED TO

02:08:41.713 --> 02:08:43.215
CREATE OTHER JOBS HERE IN

02:08:43.282 --> 02:08:44.683
CALIFORNIA AND SO WE THINK THERE

02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:46.018
SHOULD BE A TIGHTENING UP OF

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:48.787
THAT PERHAPS THE NEXUS -- FOR

02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:50.389
THE TAX CREDIT PROVISION.

02:08:50.456 --> 02:08:51.023
THE REMAINDER OF THE BILL DEALS

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:51.857
WITH THE CONTRACT AND WE HAVE

02:08:51.924 --> 02:08:53.025
SOME CONCERNS WITH THOSE

02:08:53.092 --> 02:08:55.928
PROVISIONS AS WELL. FOR US IT'S

02:08:55.994 --> 02:08:57.496
UNCLEAR HOW THIS BILL RELATES TO

02:08:57.563 --> 02:08:59.298
A EXISTING PORTION OF THE PUBLIC

02:08:59.364 --> 02:09:01.233
CONTRACTS CODE THAT WAS ENACTED

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:04.403
BY A WE NEED A BILL BACK IN.

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.937
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE PUBLIC

02:09:05.003 --> 02:09:07.473
CONTRACT COULD SECTION.

02:09:07.539 --> 02:09:08.107
TWELVE ONE FORTY THE BILL DEALT

02:09:08.173 --> 02:09:09.708
WITH CERTAIN STATE PROGRAMS CALL

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:10.876
CENTERS THAT SERVER CERTAIN

02:09:10.943 --> 02:09:12.411
STATE PROGRAMS LIKE HOW WORKS

02:09:12.478 --> 02:09:13.612
AND CAL FRESH.

02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:15.781
THAT SECTION OF THE LAW EXCLUDES

02:09:15.848 --> 02:09:18.050
CERTAIN PROGRAMS FROM THAT FROM

02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:19.751
THAT A PROVISION OF THE LAW.

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:20.552
IT ALSO SAYS THAT THOSE

02:09:20.619 --> 02:09:22.287
LIMITATIONS DON'T APPLY IF THEY

02:09:22.354 --> 02:09:23.188
WOULD VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW ARE

02:09:23.255 --> 02:09:24.857
VIOLATE SOME TYPE OF FEDERAL

02:09:24.923 --> 02:09:26.125
TRADE AGREEMENT.

02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:27.159
IT'S UNCLEAR FROM US WHETHER

02:09:27.226 --> 02:09:28.727
THIS BILL SUPERSEDES THOSE

02:09:28.794 --> 02:09:30.028
PROVISIONS OF THE LAW.

02:09:30.095 --> 02:09:31.663
SO WE HAVE SOME CONCERN ABOUT

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:33.799
HOW THE TWO PROVISIONS.

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:35.901
RELATE.

02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:36.335
FINALLY.

02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:37.402
SEVERAL EXISTING STATE CONTRACTS

02:09:37.469 --> 02:09:39.505
ALREADY DEAL WITH OVERFLOW

02:09:39.571 --> 02:09:41.673
SITUATIONS CALL VOLUME -- BUT

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.242
YOU PROBABLY ALL REMEMBER THE

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:44.676
SITUATION WE HAD IN THERE

02:09:44.743 --> 02:09:45.878
DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY WHERE

02:09:45.944 --> 02:09:47.146
EMPLOYEES WERE CALLING EDT ABOUT

02:09:47.212 --> 02:09:49.214
THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND

02:09:49.281 --> 02:09:49.815
COULD NOT GET ANYBODY ON THE

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:50.582
PHONE.

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:52.351
WAS A LARGE PROBLEM SO SOME OF

02:09:52.417 --> 02:09:53.385
THE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN STATE.

02:09:53.452 --> 02:09:54.853
AGENCY SPECIFICALLY DEAL WITH

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:56.588
CALL VOLUME.

02:09:56.655 --> 02:09:57.456
AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RINGS

02:09:57.523 --> 02:09:59.658
IF THE CALL IS NOT ANSWERED IN

02:09:59.725 --> 02:10:00.359
CALIFORNIA HAS.

02:10:00.425 --> 02:10:02.027
KICKED OVER TO ANOTHER STATE SO

02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:03.395
AT LEAST A CONSTITUENT GETS.

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:04.796
PERSON ON THE PHONE.

02:10:04.863 --> 02:10:05.797
AND SO THE REASON AMENDMENTS --

02:10:05.864 --> 02:10:07.399
DEALING WITH OVERFLOW ATTEMPT TO

02:10:07.466 --> 02:10:08.934
DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.

02:10:09.001 --> 02:10:09.735
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT

02:10:09.801 --> 02:10:11.103
MATCHES UP WITH THE CONTRACT

02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:12.204
PROVISIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY

02:10:12.271 --> 02:10:15.641
BEEN NEGOTIATED THAT DEAL WITH

02:10:15.707 --> 02:10:16.975
OVERFLOW MY UNDERSTANDING.

02:10:17.042 --> 02:10:17.876
IS THAT AGAIN SOME OF THESE

02:10:17.943 --> 02:10:18.510
CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC LIMITS

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:19.645
OF THE PHONE RINGS A CERTAIN

02:10:19.711 --> 02:10:20.612
NUMBER OF TIMES.

02:10:20.679 --> 02:10:22.514
AND ISN'T ABLE TO BE ANSWERED IN

02:10:22.581 --> 02:10:23.215
CALIFORNIA KICKS TO ANOTHER

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:25.350
STATE THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL

02:10:25.417 --> 02:10:26.118
DEALING WITH OVERFLOW.

02:10:26.185 --> 02:10:28.220
IT HAS TO BE A 30% INCREASE IN

02:10:28.287 --> 02:10:30.289
CALL VOLUME -- AND THEN THEY CAN

02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:31.924
GO TO OVERFLOW BUT ONLY FOR

02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:33.225
FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND WE THINK

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:34.660
THE EXISTING.

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:35.627
CONTRACT PROVISIONS THAT HAVE

02:10:35.694 --> 02:10:36.628
BEEN CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED DEAL

02:10:36.695 --> 02:10:38.597
WITH.

02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:39.965
CALL VOLUME AND AND WHEN CALLS

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:41.333
ARE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER STATE

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:42.768
SHOULD CONTROL.

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.536
THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT THE

02:10:44.603 --> 02:10:46.238
OVER FLOW AMENDMENTS DO NOT LINE

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:47.406
UP WITH THOSE EXISTING CONTRACT

02:10:47.472 --> 02:10:49.007
REMEDIES SO. FOR THESE REASONS

02:10:49.074 --> 02:10:50.943
AGAIN WE HAVE FUNDAMENTAL

02:10:51.009 --> 02:10:51.977
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL.

THIS STATE ONE OF THE EMPLOYERS

THAT WE REPRESENT WHICH IS

02:12:51.997 --> 02:12:53.532
EIGHTEEN T. THERE WAS.

02:12:53.598 --> 02:12:54.800

02:12:54.866 --> 02:12:57.102
SIXTY EIGHT EMPLOYEES THAT WERE

THE WARN ACT DID NOT APPLY IN

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:06.411
THE REASON THAT IT DID NOT APPLY

02:13:06.478 --> 02:13:07.846
BECAUSE HE'S OUR TECHNICIANS

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:09.314

YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE.

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:16.555

02:13:16.621 --> 02:13:19.458
EXACTLY RIGHT BUT I WILL TELL

02:13:19.524 --> 02:13:20.125

WHEN YOU ARE THE PERSON AND WE

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:23.228
ARE BECAUSE WE REPRESENT THESE

02:13:23.295 --> 02:13:24.563
WORKERS AND WE HAVE TO TELL THEM

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:26.131
THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO LOSE THEIR

02:13:26.198 --> 02:13:27.032

02:13:32.471 --> 02:13:34.005
IT WAS THAT LONG.

02:13:34.072 --> 02:13:35.006
WHEN YOU HAVE TO TELL SOMEBODY
