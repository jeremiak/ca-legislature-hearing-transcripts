AND PEOPLE COME RUNNING OKAY SO DON'T DO THATUSE YOUR BADGE HERE SELF INTO THAT DOOR TO THE REAR FOR MEMBERS BUT THAT WE WILL PROCEED WITH THEIR FIRSTITEM AB SEVENTEEN OH THREE THAT'S WHY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS. WAS RIGHT THERE AND YOU MISTER RAMOS YOU MAY PROCEED. WHEN READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARM. AND ENCOURAGEMENT AWAY MASSES WITH DURING TESTIMONY ALSO- IT'S YOUR CHOICE I'M NOT WEARING ONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AB SEVENTEEN OH THREE WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN EDUCATION ACT STUDENTS RECEIVE INSTRUCTION ON CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY STARTING FROM THE THIRD AND FOURTH GRADE THEN ON TO THE EIGHTH GRADE WITH THEM HISTORY ON THE ON THE UNITED STATES AND ELEVENTH GRADE WITH GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE- THROUGHOUT THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE HAVE LONG EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT THE HISTORY TAUGHT DURING THESE INSTRUCTIONAL PERIODS IS INACCURATE AND MISSING OR MISLEADING AND MANY TIMES FOCUSING ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE TRUE HISTORY THAT IMPACT IMPACTED THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE AND ALSO THE ACTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. THE TEACHING OF OUR TRADITIONAL LOCAL MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE OUR HISTORY AND CULTURE. WE WORK HARD TO BREAK THOSE MISCONCEPTIONS MISCONCEPTIONS THAT ALL NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SIMILAR WHEN IN FACT THERE ARE GREAT DIFFERENCES ONE STEREOTYPE IS THAT ALL NATIVE AMERICANS USE DRUMS FOR THEIR MUSIC. WHEN IN OUR LOCAL AREAS WE USE GOURD RATTLES IN HOPES OF ANIMALS AND ELDERBERRY FLUTES. THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR FACTUAL HISTORY. LIKE THE TELLING OF THE CREATION OF THE STATE MILITIAS FROM THE EIGHTEEN SIXTIES PERIOD. THAT WAS THEIR SOLE MISSION TO GET RID OF INDIAN PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE THOSE MILITIAS WERE PAID FOR BY TAXPAYERS DOLLARS THAT PART OF FACTUAL HISTORY STILL NEEDS TO BE TOLD THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE ALSO MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT NATIVE AMERICANS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE PAVE THE WAY FOR EXAMPLE MANY ROADS TRAVEL TODAY INTERSTATES AND HIGHWAYS WERE ONCE INDIAN TRAILS. SO THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS STILL NEED TO BE ACCREDITED TO THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. AB SEVENTEEN OH THREE WOULD ENCOURAGE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO FORM CALIFORNIA INDIAN EDUCATION TASK FORCE. WITH CALIFORNIA TRIBES LOCAL TO THE REGENTS. THIS BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE THOSE TASK FORCE TO DEVELOP CURRICULUM MATERIALS. FOR USE IN TEACHING ABOUT THE HISTORY CULTURE AND GOVERNMENT OF LOCAL TRIBES WITH THE INPUT. OF VOICES THAT MANY TIMES HAVE DOLLAR OF THE PROCESS. THIS PROCESS WOULD DEVELOP A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE AND CAN BUILT ON MUTUAL RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING. OF THE PRESENT CULTURE AND HISTORY OF OUR PEOPLE. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE VICE CHAIRMAN JOHNNY HERNANDEZ FROM THE SALMON WELL TRIBAL GOVERNMENT. AND VICE CHAIR JANET GENEVA MODEL FROM THIS OF BOBA TRIBAL GOVERNMENT TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN OH THREE. AND I WILL HAVE- VICE CHAIR.

THIS WAS THE CERES STEREOTYPE THAT MY FELLOW CLASSMATES LEARNED IN THE HISTORY BOOKS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT GRADE SCHOOL AND BECAUSE I WAS INDIAN I MUST STILL LIVE IN THE SAME WAY KNOWING THAT ONLY PARTICULAR TRIBES WERE TAUGHT IN HISTORY AND BRUTAL BATTLES SOMEONE DID IT INDIAN STILL EVEN EXISTED BEING IN THE FOURTH GRADE WE WERE TAUGHT ABOUT THE SPANISH MISSIONS WHO WERE SO CALLED CAME TO RESCUE AND TO CONFORM THE NATIVE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY DID NOT TEACH THE CHU AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF THE HARSH REALITY OF THE LIFE THAT OCCURRED TO CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE NOT KNOWING THAT THE TIME IN FOURTH GRADE I CHOSE MISSION FAMILIES RAY AS MY PROJECT HAD I HAVE KNOWN I WOULD HAVE DONE MY OWN TRIBE'S HISTORY AT IS AS EQUALLY IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT GIVEN NOW THAT MY OWN TWO CHILDREN ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SUCH PROJECTS I ALWAYS HAVE THEM DO SOMETHING THAT RELATES TO CIBULKOVA. OR. ANY OTHER TRAVEL AFFILIATE. NOW SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN BUT TO EDUCATE THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS AS WELL AS THEIR INSTRUCTOR. THE PRIDE THAT THEY HAVE TO PRESENT ABOUT THE CULTURE AND COMMUNITY MAKES THEM PROUD OF WHO THEY ARE. WHETHER THE TRUTH IS HARD HARSH THE TRUTH NEEDS TO BE TOLD AND BY THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES. WHO HAVE INHERITED THE RICH HISTORY AND CULTURE. THEY NEED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO CONSIDER AB ONE SEVEN OH THREE TO ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE WITH THE TRIBES LOCAL IN THE REGION. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE FIRST PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THOSE WHO RESIDE IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA NATIVES HAVE BEEN RESILIENT AND SURVIVE THE MOST EXTREME ACTS OF GENOCIDE AND COLONIZATION. IT'S TIME TO TEACH THE TRUE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. OF THE HUNDRED AND NINE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE TRIBES THAT REMAIN AND RECOGNIZED IT'S IMPORTANT TO TEACH ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE IN ALL SCHOOLS. HOW INSTRUCTION IS DEVELOPED AND OFFERED IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE TRIBES. WE ARE EAGER TO SHARE. OUR CULTURE HISTORY AND OUR COMMUNITY.

AS SOMEONE WHOSE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHO PENNED PERSON BEEN EVACUATED FOR MY HOME MULTIPLE TIMES I KNOW HOW IMPORTANTIT IS TO BE PREPARED. UNFORTUNATELY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE'VE EXPERIENCED MORE AND MORE NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS WILDFIRES AND FLOODS AND SADLY WE ARE EXPERIENCING HUMAN CAUSE TRAGEDIES SUCH AS AN ACT OF VIOLENCE ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS OR AT THE DISASTROUS CHEMICAL SPILL. AB TWENTY EIGHT FOURTEEN WOULD AUTHORIZE A MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR COMPETITIVE EMERGENCY PLANNING GRANTS TO HELP LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES PRIORITIZING THESE AWARDS FOR ELEAZAR FACE THE GREATEST RISK OF OR HAVE LESS CAPACITY TO PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIES THE BILL WOULD PROVOKE PROMOTE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF STUDENTS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES DURING AN EMERGENCY. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION BETWEEN EMERGENCY PERSONNEL AND ELEAZAR TO BE BEST PREPARED FOR EMERGENCIES HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DR STEVE HERRINGTON SUPERINTENDENT FOR CINEMA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND DEB CUBAN SUPERINTENDENT OF THE HI A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU WITNESSES. AND GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS STEVE HARRINGTON COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT FOR CINEMA COUNTY. AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT FOURTEEN. THE BILL SPONSORED BY SOME WOMEN WOULD. IT WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE THE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS FOR BETTER NATURAL DISASTER PREPAREDNESS. I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE. A FITNESS CALIFORNIA EDUCATOR FOR FIFTY ONE YEARS. I'VE GONE THROUGH FOR NATURAL DISASTER FIRES TO FLOODS. EARTHQUAKE SO I TELL YOU BASED ON THOSE EXPERIENCES AND THE PANDEMIC. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. ORDINATED SERVICES IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS DISTRICTS INCLUDING MY OWN HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THIS WORK ON. VOLUNTARILY HOWEVER MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. FROM COMING UP WITH A CONTINGENCY PLAN AND SAFETY MEASURES FOR WILDFLOWER FIRES AND FLOODS HEAT WAVES POWER SHUT OFFS STAYING ON TOP OF COOLEY PROTECTIVE MEASURES. LOCAL EDUCATION EDUCATION AGENCIES BECOME KEY PARTNERS IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AND HEALTHY. SINCE THEN PRESIDENT SERIES OF MASSIVE WILDFIRES DESTROYED MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND HOMES IN SONOMA COUNTY THE STAFF AT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN IN THE STATE OF REGULAR COLLABORATION WITH OUR COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. PREVIOUSLY SUCH DISASTERS OCCURRED ROUGHLY ONCE IN A GENERATION. IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT THANKS IN PART TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS INCREASE DROUGHT AND THE SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AS I SAID EARLIER. FOR MASSIVE WILDLAND BLAZES SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND WE'VE ENTERED INTO A MORE INSTRUCTIONAL LOSS IN OUR COUNTY WITH THE FORTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF OVER TWELVE HUNDRED SCHOOL DAYS. TAKEN FOR EXEMPTION SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA GRAPPLING WITH A WORSENING OF THE DROUGHT THE WILDFLOWER FIRES REMEMBER SANTA BARBARA IN THE MUD SLIDES. THOSE THINGS WERE COORDINATED AND WE LOST IT INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS INCIDENT SANTA BARBARA IN IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AT THE MONTECITO. EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS CONTINUE TO MULTIPLY AND AFFECT MORE OF OUR STATES. THIS BILL BY ASSEMBLYMAN WOULD WOULD BE IF IS A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR OUR LOCAL SCHOOLSDURING RECENT DISASTERS BEING PREPARED IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU WELL DONE YOUR NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE I'M SUPERINTENDENT DEB CUBAN SUPERINTENDENT FOR UKIAH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN BEAUTIFUL MENDOCINO COUNTY. IN ADDITION TO THE MANY FIRES WE HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS EIGHT MONTHS AGO WE HAD AN EXTREMELY CONCERNING FIRE IN THE HILLS LESS THAN A MILE DIRECTLY WEST OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL. SCHOOL IS IN SESSION AND WE ARE CLOSE TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS AND STAFF ON CAMPUS DURING THAT TIME. THANKFULLY CAL FIGHTER IN OUR LOCAL RESPONDERS WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN THE FIRE. DURING A DEBRIEFING WE DISCUSSED EVACUATION ROUTES ARE YOU KIND OF VALLEY- FIRE CHIEF EDUCATED US ON THE BEST EVACUATION ROUTES CONSIDERING HOW NGUYEN TYPICALLY RUNS THROUGH THE AREA BY OUR HIGH SCHOOL. AND IT WASN'T THE ROUTE WE HAD IN OUR PLAN- IN REALITY OUR ROUTE WAS NOT THE SAFEST ONE CONSIDERING THE WINDS AT THE TIME. AND COMBINING THE EXPERTISE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE ANDEMS WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL PROFESSIONALS WILL HELP US DEVELOP THE STRONGEST CRISIS RESPONSE PLANS. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN ENOUGH NATURAL DISASTERS AND DR HARRINGTON DESCRIBED THEM WE ARE NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. THAT I KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS A BIG LEARNING CURVE WHEN EVERYONE GETS TO THE TABLE. AT THE MINUTE COUNTS AND I'M SPENT GETTING ON THE SAME PAGE TAKES AWAY FROM PRECIOUS MOMENTS NEEDED TO ENSURE SAFETY AND SAVE LIVES. WE NEED TO BE A STEP AHEAD OF THE NEXT UNKNOWN AND CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE ONE. DISTRICTS LIKE OURS IF WE HAD MORE TIME TO UNDERSTAND IN PLAN IN A DEEPER MORE HOLISTIC- AGENCY WIDE COMMUNITY WIDE WAY OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WOULD ULTIMATELY COME OUT ON TOP. WHEN WE'RE CHALLENGED WITH THAT NEXT NATURAL DISASTER YOU CAN HELP US PREPARE FOR THE INEVITABLE NEXT CRISIS I URGE YOU TO PASS AB TWENTY EIGHT FOURTEEN.

SO THAT MEANS OTHER MEMBERS NEED TO GET DOWN HERE SO WE CAN HEAR THEIR BILLS. SO HIS IS IT I HAVE FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN. THAT'S AB TWO ZERO SEVEN TWO MR GABRIEL YOU MAY PROCEED ONE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN THE NEW HEARING ROOM IT LOOKS NICE SO IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU I'M IT ACTUALLY YEAH EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY TWO TWO ZERO SEVEN TWO. NICE NICE THE DETAILS OF THE CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD- THIS IS A BILL THAT PICKS UP ON A TOPIC THAT I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE WORKED ON A LOT WHICH IS THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE- AND ALSO BEING PREPARED FOR DISASTER SITUATIONS WHETHER THOSE ARE WILD FIRES. OR MAN MADE DISASTERS SUCH AS GUN VIOLENCE SITUATIONS AND THE POINT OF THIS BILLS TO ENCOURAGE LITTLE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO COORDINATE AGREEMENTS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THE KIND THAT THEY HAVE WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS RESPONDING TO A BIG WILD FIRE OR A BIG. EMERGENCY SITUATION BECAUSEWE KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN EXPERIENCE TRAUMA AS A RESULT OF THIS WE KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PERSONALITY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL TO RESPOND. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE TRAUMA OF THOSE EVENTS- CAN LAST WITH STUDENTS FOR SOME TIME- AND I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE LIVE THIS PERSONALLY I CERTAINLY SITE WHEN THE WEALTHY FIRE RIPPED THROUGH PART OF MY COMMUNITY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD STUFF IN THERE IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT HOW FREQUENT THESE WILDFIRES HAVE BECOME HOW HOW PROLIFIC THEY BECOME ACROSS THE STATE AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AT CHARTER SCHOOLS TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER TO MAKE SURE IN THE EVENT OF A TRAUMATIC. INCIDENT THEY CAN'T SHIFT RESOURCES BACK AND FORTH TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE GETTING THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED WITHOUT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY. DR HARRINGTON THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT FROM THE CINEMA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL-LIKE THE POPE. CHILD NATURAL DISASTER- YOU ARE. YEAH I AM I HAD A NUMBER OF THEM. YES I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MINSK. GABRIEL'S BILL. I'VE ALSO BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR THE UNITED STATES HOUSE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON MUTUAL AID BILL. AS IT RELATES TO FEMA. STUDENTS WHO GO THROUGH THE TRAUMA OF THE NATURAL DISASTER IT STAYS WITH THEM. YOU HAVE SMALL COME INTO THE VALLEY STUDENTS ARE PETRIFIED AGAIN. I SO I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU AN ADVOCATE FOR TO YOU. THE REASON FOR THIS BILL. THE COORDINATES OF MUTUAL AID TYPE SYSTEM SO THAT LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. CAN QUICKLY DEPLOY A QUALIFIED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AND OTHER PERSONNEL. IN THE AREAS OF EXPERIENCE OF NATURAL DISASTER AND TRAUMA. IN OUR COMMUNITY AS I STATED EARLIER. WE NEEDED A ROBUST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS AND BECAME APPARENT AFTER OUR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. NORTH BAY WILDFIRE. WE LOST TO SCHOOLS. FIVE THOUSAND HOMES. AND THE NEED IS GROWING FOLLOWING THREE MORE WILDFIRES IN THROUGH TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. STATE THE STRESSES BROUGHT ON YEARS. THE KINDERGARTNERS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN ARE SIXTH GRADERS TODAY WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH THAT TRAUMA EVERY TIME SMOKE COMES IN THE VALLEY. IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEED AND TO SURVEY THE DATA SHOWING OF OUR STUDENTS KNOW COUNTY. CREATED ITS OWN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. BECAUSE IT WAS SO APPARENT TO ME THAT CHILDREN NEED OUR SUPPORT. RESPONDING TO NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER TRAUMATIC EVENTS IS A YEAR ROUND UNDERTAKING. MY STAFF WENT OUT TO BE YOU COUNTY WHEN IT EXPERIENCED THE PARADISE FIRE BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THE NEED. MY COUNTY THE COUNTY WENT OUT TO MRS CENA COUNTY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. BUT THIS IS ONE COUNTY PROVIDING SUPPORT TO ANOTHER COUNTY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN IT. BUT WE NEED TO COORDINATE OUR SERVICES STATEWIDE AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO COORDINATE THOSE SERVICES BETWEEN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SMALL COUNTIES JOINING TOGETHER TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR MUTUAL AID. OUR TEAM OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ALREADY WORK TO ASSIST SCHOOLS AND THAT WE DEVELOP RESOURCES. WE HAVE. BASICALLY ALREADY PROVIDED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SOFTWARE SYSTEM WHERE PARENTS STUDENTS CAN LOG IN AND IDENTIFY THEIR NEEDS FORCE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT ALL ALL BASED ON THE EFFORTS OF OUR OWN EXPERIENCE BUT THAT SHOULD BE REPLICATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THIS BILL BECAUSE INVEST COUNTY OFFICES WITH THE FORMER RESPONSIBILITY OF COORDINATING HEALTH. SUCH AN APPROACH WILL HELP ENSURE OUR SCHOOLS WILL BE PROACTIVE RATHER THAN REACTIVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE HANDLE THE COLLECTIVE ACTS OF MULTIPLE TRAUMAS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES REPORT SEEING ON ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS DEREK CLASS WITH THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS ASSOCIATION ARE PROCESS COMES AFTER THIS HEARING BUT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING. THANK YOU- SO NO FURTHER SUPPORT- ANY MEMBER ANY ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SAYING NO NO NOBODY IN OPPOSITION AS BRING IT BACK ANY COMMENTS FROM ANY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE BALLOT. AT I JUST WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A PERSONAL. EXPERIENCE TO REINFORCE OF CERTAINLY THE COMMENTS OF BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THE SUPERINTENDENT IT'S TAKING ITS TIME TO BE HERE TODAY- THAT IS AT I WAS COACHING- RECENTLY OF A GROUP OF YOUNG BOYS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD. AND THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED SMOKE STARTED BILLOWING IN. AND WE WENT FROM A COMPLETE FOCUS ON ATHLETICS. TO THERE WAS TREMENDOUS KIDS IT WOULD IT. YOU KNOW IS THERE A FIRE DO WE HAVE TO GO IT WAS JUST I WAS AND THIS WAS YEARS AFTER THE THOMAS FIRE HAD COME THROUGH SO- YOUR STATEMENT THAT THIS HAS A REAL IMPACT ON ON YOUNG PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME. THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL THANK YOU A MOVIE RECOMMENDED ACTION. MENAMBAH EXECUTIVE. VICE CHAIR DAHLE. SO SOMEONE WHO IS- IN MY DISTRICT THE FIRST THE SENATE DISTRICT WE'VE EXPERIENCED GREENVILLE LAST YEAR WHICH WAS TERRIBLY TRAUMATIZING- FOR OUR COMMUNITY I THINK THE CONCERN FOR ME I APPRECIATE THE SPELLING I'LL BE VOTING FOR TODAY IS WE'RE SO WE'RE SO SHORT MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND OUR RULE COMMUNITIES I I'M A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER SO A MANDATE COMING DOWN ON TO A SMALL SCHOOL AND YOU. DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO EVEN TO COORDINATE BETWEEN THREE SMALL COUNTIES IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT AND LASSEN AND MODOC AND SIERRA. SO I THINK WE- IN FUTURE DISCUSSIONS WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT PERHAPS EXEMPTIONS ARE PARTNER SOMEHOW PARTNERING WITH A LARGER COUNTY BECAUSE- IT'S ALWAYS SOUNDS GREAT. BUT WE- WE DON'T HAVE GRANT WRITERS WE DON'T WE LITERALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS SO. I KNOW YOUR SITUATION WELL AS WE SINCE STAFF THERE. SO IT IS A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL LOOKS AT IS THE DEVELOPING A LINE OF COMMUNICATION WHO WOULD PLUMAS CALL ON TO GET SUPPORT. WHERE IS THAT SUPPORT. WAS A PLASTER COUNTY OR IS IT- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE PROBABLY THE LARGER COUNTY THE COULD COME UP TO GIVE YOU SUPPORT. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER I APPRECIATE THE IN THE COMMENTS AND I THINK THEY'RE WELL TAKEN I'M HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT CRAFTED WE HAD INTENSELY BAKED. A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY INTO THIS BILL BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS AND YOU KNOW RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN MY COMMUNITY AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND SO WE WANT DISTRICTS TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. TO DO THE COORDINATION THAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST IN DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE BUT WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR FEEDBACK AS WE- MOVE THIS BILL THROUGH THE PROCESS I THINK I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT. GREAT THE MANDATE IS THAT THEY TALK NOT NECESSARILY THAT THEY HIGH FIVE BODIES IDENTIFIED THAT THEY CAN CALL RIGHT AWAY. AND THEY DON'T HAVE LIABILITIES. I'M WITH THAT- WE HAD A MOTION AND A SECOND- YOU MAY CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FROM ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU- SURGERY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM SEVEN AB TWO ZERO SEVEN TWO THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED YOU ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. O'DONNELL I O'DONNELL I DALLI. DALLI II BENNETT. BENNETT I CAN MCCARTY AYE QUIRK-SILVA YES THE BILL HAS SIX VOTE SO IT IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU BOTH. IT WITH THAT- WE NEED AUTHORS HERE WE NEED MR LEVINE- MISSTATED IS. COOPER WAS ALREADY DID IT MATTER MISTER CARTER EDUARDO GARCIA- MISS CARILLO THIS RUBIO I'M AT THIS MCCARTY- YOU'RE HERE- MRS THREE OF US. IT'S RECORDED HERE'S A LITTLE HAD TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN IT'S A B. TWO FIVE SEVEN THREE SIXTEEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT THIS BILL IT'S ABOUT- ARE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM AND OUR TEACHERS WORKING IN CAREER TACK AND ADULT EDUCATION MAKING SURE THEY HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO PURSUE THEIR CAREER GET FAIR TREATMENT. FIRST I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS STABLE EXPERIENCE IN HIGH QUALITY TEACHERS TO HELP THEM REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. ESTABLISHING A PATHWAY FOR QUALIFIED TEACHERS TO ATTAIN PERMANENT EMPLOYEE STATUS PROVIDES GREATER STABILITY FOR BOTH TEACHERS. AND STUDENTS AND OUR CREATOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY. THIS BILL WILL GIVE ALL TEACHERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE PERMANENT PERMANENT EMPLOYEE STATUS PERMIT EMPLOYEES HAVE A BETTER JOB SECURITY. ARE ENTITLED TO GREATER DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND HAVE PREFERENTIAL RE HIGHER RATES THAN NON PERMANENT EMPLOYEES HOWEVER EXISTING LAW. AS A TWO TIERED SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WE EXCLUDE SOME GROUPS OF EDUCATORS FROM THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN PERMANENT STATUS. MAINLY FOCUSING ON ADULT EDUCATION AND CTE TEACHERS TO AREAS WE NEED. EXTRA ATTENTION IN CALIFORNIA ALSO TEACHES A VERY SMALL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES. BLIGHTED CALIFORNIA'S CRISIS LEVEL TEACHER SHORTAGE AND COVER NINETEEN WE HAVE AN ISSUE ENSURING QUALIFIED TEACHERS ARE ABLE TO RETURN BASIC PROFESSIONAL RIGHTS THIS SHOULD BE A NO BRAINER FOR ALL OF US. BUT THIS IS NOT A FREE PASS TEACHERS MUST DEAL SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE. TWO YEAR PROBATIONARY PERIODS BEFORE THE EARNED PERMANENT STATUS FURTHER NOTHING IN THIS BILL PREVENTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES FROM TERMINATING. BERMAN EMPLOYEES FOR JUST BECAUSE THEY JUST HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS LIKE OTHER CREDENTIALED TEACHERS HAVE TO GO. I THIS ENSURES TEACHERS HAVE PROPER- RIGHTS AND DUE PROCESS AND WE HAVE A FAIRNESS FOR ALL CREDENTIALED TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA. WITH ME TO TESTIFY ARE A LOCAL TEACHER FROM THE L. GROVE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION MAYES A BUTTON THERE. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK I'M KATIE HARTMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION PTA THE CROWD OF PRODS CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WANTED THANK MISTER MCCARTY AND OUR OTHER JOINT AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I DO KNOW MOST TEACHERS ARE PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN PERMANENT STATUS- AFTER THEY COMPLETE A PROBATIONARY PERIOD. AND THIS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE CERTAIN JOB PROTECTIONS AND DUE PROCESS IF DISAGREEMENTS ARISE HOWEVER AS WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY OF OUR TEACHERS ACROSS THE STATE THESE PROTECTIONS ARE NOT PROVIDED TO ALL EDUCATORS CERTAIN TEACHERS ARE EXCLUDED INCLUDING THOSE IN REGIONAL OCT OCCUPATIONAL CENTERS ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM PROGRAMS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES WITH LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY THREE WOULD CHANGE THAT TO PROVIDE THOSE EMPLOYEES WITH THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS OTHER TEACHERS AT OBTAINING PERMANENT STATUS DE TA BELIEVES ALL TEACHERS SHOULD BE TREATED AS PROFESSIONALS AND AFFORDED DUE PROCESS RIGHTS REGARDLESS OF WHAT SUBJECT THEY TEACH OR WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY TEACHING. THIS BILL DOES NOT PREVENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM LAYING OFF STAFF OR ELIMINATING PROGRAMS DUE TO CHANGES THE NEEDS AND THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE FOR LAYOFFS AND MAKING PROGRAM CHANGES THIS BILL JUST ENSURES THAT TEACHERS ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND PROFESSIONALLY IN THAT PROCESS. MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED TEACHER AND STOCKINGS SHORTAGES AS YOU ALL KNOW AND THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE MORE STABILITY FOR OUR TEACHER WORKFORCE AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S BETTER FOR STUDENTS SO. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S DAVE SWINDLE I AM AN ADULT ED TEACHER WITH ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL pTEACHER. I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS OF WORKING WITH ADULTS. AT R. GERBER OFFICE AS WELL AS WITH- STUDENTS IN OUR JAILS AT SACRAMENTO COUNTY JAIL AND RIO CONSUME THAT'S CORRECTION CENTER A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY ROLE AS A TEACHER AND REALLY HOW THIS BILL WOULD AFFECT US- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED AS I HAVE COME FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I WORKED IN THE CLEANING INDUSTRY FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. SO I TEACH THE CUSTODIAL TRADES AND IN DOING SO- IT'S ALL. BEEN A VERY LUCRATIVE THING WHERE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP A LOT OF STUDENTS BE ABLE TO ATTAIN JOBS WHEN THEY COME OUT OF JAIL. IT'S LOWER DOT SOME OF THE RECIDIVISM ISSUES THAT WE SEE WITH STUDENTS. BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM COULD FOLLOW A CAREER PATHWAY. SO THAT'S PROVIDER BE A LOT OF JOY. AT THE REALITY IS THOUGH I LEFT A VERY LUCRATIVE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO BECOME A TEACHER. I DID THAT BECAUSE I HAD A PASSION FOR TEACHING AND FOR HELPING PEOPLE. ONE OF THE THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN I TOOK ON THIS ROLE IS THAT MY POSITION AS A TEACHER WAS A TEMPORARY ONE. WHERE EVERY YEAR I WOULD BE LAID OFF FROM MY POSITION. AND EVERY YEAR I WOULD HAVE TO BE REHIRED. BUT THAT DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE CASE SO FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SEE SOMETHING THAT WOULD CHANGE THAT. AND ALLOW ME TO KNOW THAT I HAVE. AN ABILITY TO GROW IN MY CAREER AND CONTINUE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AND STUDENTS. REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO MY FELLOW TEACHERS AND ADULT EDUCATION. SO THIS IS ASUB MIGHT. ASK YOU GUYS TO GIVE CONSIDERATION TO. AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT OUR STUDENTS THE BENEFITS THAT WE CAN BRING TO OUR STUDENTS AND HOW IT'S GOING TO AFFECT- ADULTS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS IN THE ROOM IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON NAVNEET PER YEAR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. FIFTY MARK ON BEHALF OF CFT A UNION EDUCATORS AND CLASSIFIED PROFESSIONALS WE ORDER SUPPORT AS A PROUD BECAUSE BONSER. GOOD AFTERNOON MY PATTERSON ON THE AUTOMOTIVE TEACHER AT SOUTH TAHOE HIGH SCHOOL ALSO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. REPRESENTING TEACHERS ON THE NORTH STATE- THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE PERMANENT STATUS BECAUSE ROOTS WHILE COUNTY OFFICES AND SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. ALEXANDER KHANDAN AND YELLED INSTRUCTIONAL COACH AND TEACHER AND OAK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I'VE ALSO WITH CTA. AND HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE ADULT EDUCATION TEACHERS AS A LEADER AT MY LOCAL THINK UNITED I AM SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT SEEM TO OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL YOU CAN COME FORWARD. SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE TO. THERE'S TWO THERE'S TWO FOLKS COME UP TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT ALL THANK YOU. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. A AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RICH TO BARNEY TAME A COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS SCHOOLS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION S. STA AS OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY THREE BECAUSE OF ITS EFFECT IT WOULD BE HAVE ON THE STATE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY THREE WOULD REDUCE SMALL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS CHANGING NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS POPULATION FOR ELEAZAR WITHIN ABA OF LESS THAN TWO FIFTY EVEN SLIGHT FLUCTUATIONS IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT CHANGES STAFFING NEEDS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT SMALL ONLY AS RETAIN THE ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO CHANGES THE STUDENT ENROLLMENT AS OUR BUDGETS DO NOT ALLOW US TO KEEP THE WORK FORCE BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS AND SCHOOL COMMUNITY CURRENT LAW ALLOWS A LEASE WITH THE SMALL STUDENT ENROLLMENT TO BE ADEPT AT STE MEETING STAFFING CHALLENGES AND HEARD. OF BEING SMALL THERE IS PRECEDENT THROUGHOUT ADD CODE TO TREAT SMALLER DISTRICTS DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE SMALL DISTRICTS ARE EXEMPT FROM BUDGET RESERVE CAP AND NECESSARY SMALLSCHOOLS RECEIVE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS SSPA ALSO HAS REAL CONCERN WITH THE BILL'S LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PROBATIONER TEACHERS CREDIT FOR A FULL YEAR SERVED SO LONG AS A PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE SERVES JUST 75% OF THE NUMBER OF DAYS REQUIRED OF THE ASSIGNMENT REGARDLESS OF THE ASSIGNMENT DURATION. ASSIGNMENTS OFTEN INCLUDE PART TIME EMPLOYMENT THE SPANS ONLY A FEW MONTHS AND SOMETIMES. SO THIRTY DAY CONTRA SIXTY DAY CONTRACT WOULD- SEND THAT PERSON ON THEIR WAY TO PERMANENCY. THESE ASIGNMENT COURAGE DO NOT PROVIDE THE TIME NEEDED USTO ASSESS PROBATIONARY TEACHERS AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE SKILLS ALL OF OUR KIDS DESERVE IN THEIR EDUCATORS. NEARLY HALF OF OUR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND 20% OF DISTRICTS HAVE AN ETA OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR LESS. THESE REPRESENT A DISTINCT TYPE OF L. EA IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT WE VALUE OUR TEACHERS TREMENDOUSLY. BUT WE CANNOT HIDE FROM THE REALITIES OF WORKING IN OUR STATE'S SMALLEST OF SMALLS WERE NEEDS CHANGE RAPIDLY AND OFTEN WITHOUT NOTICE NOTICE FOR THESE REASONS SST A REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OF DONALD MEMBERS MY NAME IS JULIE DUNCAN I'M REPRESENTING K. ROB IN THE C. T. E. J. P. A. COALITION COMPRISED OF R. C. P. R. P. PROGRAM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. UNFORTUNATELY I'M HERE TODAY TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY THREE AND THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS IT WILL HAVE AN R. O. P. PROGRAMS. I'M NOT HERE TO OPPOSE TEACHERS HAVING DUE PROCESS IN THE LAYOUT PROCESS. HOWEVER THIS BILL WILL CREATE HUGE HURDLES- PLACE AN IMPOSSIBLE BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS IF YOU'RE FORCED TO IMPLEMENT LAYOFFS. THAT RELIANCE SENIORITY RATHER THAN SUCCESSFUL INNOVATIVE AND INDUSTRY RELEVANT PATHWAYS WE TEACH. CURRENT STATURE ALLOWS OUR PEACE TO BE FLEXIBLE SO WE CAN ADAPT OUR CTE PATHWAYS ALWAYS TO SAY CURRENT AND RELEVANT. TO THE LOCAL AND STATE ECONOMIES. INDUSTRY CHANGES AND AFFECTS WHAT COURSES WE OFFER OR WE DON'T OFFER BASED ON LOCAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. FOR THIS REASON RP STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO CLASSES LIKE VIDEO GAME ART DESIGN CYBERSECURITY SPORTS MEDICINE. ROP COURSES AND PROGRAMS TO MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT. OR RESULT IN FURTHER EDUCATION IN THE FIELD OF STUDY SO THEY HAVE CAREERS BY CHOICE AND NOT BY CHANCE. IMPLEMENTING SEARED SENIORITY BASED LAYOFFS WOULD FORCE US TO RETAIN TEACHERS AND PROGRAMS THAT MAY NOT HAVE LABOR MARKET DEMAND. OR FOR WHICH THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROPER EXPERTISE IN TRAINING BECAUSE THE WAY C. G. CREDENTIALS ARE STRUCTURED. FOR EXAMPLE A TEACHER IN DENTISTRY HAS THE SAME EXACT SEJUK HE CREDENTIAL HEALTH SCIENCE. AS A TEACHER IN SPORTS MEDICINE. A NETWORK TECHNICIAN HAS EXACT SAME ICT CREDENTIAL AS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER. BUT IF I NEED TO IMPLEMENT A LAYOFF THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ME TO LAY OFF BASED ON SENIORITY AND NOT THE COURSE THAT HAS GREATER INDUSTRY DEMAND BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME EXACT CREDENTIAL. ARE- HE'S ALSO DO NOT HAVE STABLE FUNDING. DEDICATED FUNDING WITH THE ELIMINATION OF KARAKUL FUNNY ARE UP HE'S REALLY ON RELY ON YOUR TO YOUR ON COMPETITIVE GRANTS SUCH AS THE C. T. AND CENTER GRANT THANK YOU O'DONNELL. AND K. TWELVE STRONG WORKFORCE GRANTS BOTH. SUPPLEMENT ARE FUNDING BUT DO NOT COVER A FRACTION OF OUR COST. AND AGAIN OUR FUNDING IS COMPETITIVE NOT GUARANTEED. ARE YOU MANY FUNDS TO OPERATE OR DEPENDENT YOUR YOUR UPON MEMBER DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES LOCAL DECISIONS. THE CLASSES WE OFFER OUR A LACK. IN OUR LOCAL DECISIONS ON STUDENT A MAN. LABOR WORK FOR SEASON PRIORITIES OF THE DISTRICTS NOW MORE THAN EVER ARE ABUSING TO RETAIN THE CURRENT LAW. THAT GIVES US THIS FLEXIBILITY FOR PROGRAMS. FOR THESE REASONS PLEASE RECONSIDER THE IMPACT AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE WOULD HAVE AN R. O. P. PROGRAMS. THE PATHWAYS WE OFFER TO STUDENTS SHOULD BE DICTATED BY THE LABOR MARKET NEEDS. NOT TO YOUR SENIORITY OF TEACHERS YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MAY COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON DEREK LENNIX ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON DOROTHY JOHNSON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION AND THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION RESPECTFULLY POST. ELIZABETH ASK OF ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE YOU KNOW FURTHER OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR MANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER BENNETT A- IT TO THE AUTHOR I CASTERLY SUPPORT YOUR CONCEPT IT WITH REGARDS TO THE SMALL SCHOOLS AND- GETTING THEM ON THE SAME TENURE TRACK- I DO THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE R. O. P- PEOPLE ARE WILL THAT I HOPE AS IS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THAT I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AND SEE IF YOU CAN WORK THOSE THOSE- THOSE ISSUES OUTSIDE OF THE RP PROGRAMS ARE. MORE COMPLICATED AND TO BE MORE NIMBLE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU I JUST A COMMENT ON THAT TOPIC MISTER BENNETT. AS I UNDERSTAND IT ACTUALLY LAW TODAY. DOESN'T NECESSARILY. THE LAST IN FIRST OUT. IT'S A MISNOMER AND THAT'S- PROMULGATED BY GROUPS WHO WANT TO GET TEACHERS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT SAYS IF I'M CORRECT I THINK I AM IS LAST IN FIRST OUT AND LAST. THAT LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD ADOPTS A DIFFERENT POLICY. SO TO BE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD TO ADOPT A DIFFERENT POLICY I DO AND I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN. MR THANK YOU SO OCT BEFORE I WAS ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY I SAT ON A VERY SMALL SCHOOL BOARD- I'M STRONGLY OPPOSED BECAUSE I THINK WITH IT THIS IS ACTUALLY GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LAY A TEACHER OFF WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW I HAVE SCHOOLS ROBIN DISTRICT THERE WERE FIRES OR SCOLDED WE HAD CHILDREN MOVING 30% OF KIDS MOVE FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER SO YOU HAD TO UP YOUR TEACHERS AT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WAS OPENED IN PERSON. THEN THERE THEN THE NEXT YEAR YOU'RE BUDGET LOOKS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THOSE CHILDREN HAVE GONE BACK TO ANOTHER SCHOOL I THINK THIS IS- TIME TO POORLY BECAUSE OUR SCHOOLS ARE REELING RIGHT NOW AND ARE STILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE FUNDED IN THE YEARS TO COME I RESPECT TEACHERS VERY MUCH AND I WOULD LOVE AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY PERMANENT STATUS FOR ALL OF THEM THAT CAME THROUGH BECAUSE I VALUE THE WORK THAT YOU DO. BUT- BUDGETS ARE WHAT THEY ARE AND I'M I AM VERY CONCERNED THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE. THE OPPOSITE. EFFECT FOR TEACHERS ARE GOING TO FEEL EVEN MORE LESS- SECURE IN THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OUR OUR SMALL SCHOOLS WHICH THIS LITERALLY TARGETS MY ENTIRE DISTRICT. SO I AM STRONGLY OPPOSED TODAY. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER COMMENTS FROM ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEES MR LEE. THANKS TO SHARE. I THANK THE AUTHOR BRING THIS BILL BACK AGAIN FOR THIS COMMITTEE I CERTAINLY AS WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH TEACHER RETENTION RECRUITMENT RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE STATE I DO HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE GIVES ONE MORE PIECE OF MIND TO ARE. A DIFFERENT TEACHERS DIFFERENT SITUATIONS CERTAINLY I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR FOR THEM TO AS YOU SAID YOUR STORY THAT YOU HAVE TO GET HIRED YOUR FEW WITHOUT THAT KIND OF HIS IDEA AS WE ALREADY HAVE. A HARD ENOUGH TIME ATTRACT NEW TALENT OF COURSE THEY DO SHARE SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM WILLIAM BENNETT ABOUT HOW WE CAN ADAPT TO MAKE SURE CITY SCHOOLS CAN STAY NIMBLE I THINK THERE MUST BE SOME BELTING NIP YOU KNOW RESPONDING TO THE- CLASSES THE TRADES I NEED TO BE TAUGHT WITHOUT. SACRIFICING THE PEOPLE THAT TEACH IT IN A WAY I THINK THAT ON BALANCE THERE AND I DO HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH R. J- OUR CITY SCHOOLS IDEA CITY SCHOOL IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL THAT. I'D CERTAINLY IS VERY VALUABLE BUT WE WANT TO HOPEFULLY TREAT THOSE WORKERS AND EDUCATES RESPECTABLE SO HAVE YOU SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- AND TECHNICAL. IT KNOW WHAT MISTER MARK. CAN AS CHAIR OF SUB. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THIS MAKE SURE THAT WE ADEQUATELY. FUND OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND I KNOW HE'S GOING TO DO THAT. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE CALAMITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED. MISTER BENNETT. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ONE THING AS- I DO I THINK THE IDEA. I JUST. MY VIEW FOR THE RECORD IDEA THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO LAY TEACHERS OFTEN THEIR FIRST YEAR. MY PERCEPTION AFTER BEING AN ADMINISTRATOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME IT. IS THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU HAVE TO IT'S THE SECOND YEAR THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE HARD DECISION AS AN ADMINISTRATOR- MOVING FORWARD NOT. NOT THE FIRST YEAR. OF THE FIRST YEAR IT'S VERY CLEAR IS A SECOND YEAR BY MARCH WHEN YOU HAVE TO SEND OUT THAT EMPLOYMENT LETTER. THAT STARTS THEM FOR THE THIRD YEAR SO. YOU DO HAVE TIME AND- MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN ADMINISTRATORS ARE EITHER GOING TO GET IT IN GEAR AND GET OUT AND DO THE EVALUATIONS AND ALL THAT ARE. OR THEY AREN'T AND- SO THAT'S THAT'S PART OF. WHY I THINK IT'S- IT'S JUSTIFIED. IN IN TERMS OF DOING THIS **** SO. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT- THAT WAS CLARIFIED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- MISTER MCCARTY MAY CLOSE YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES AS WELL SO I'LL TALK TO. THE BILL ON THE MERITS AND SECOND BUT JUST THE BIG PICTURE. THE FISCAL ISSUE NOT A FEW OF YOU ARE ON OUR SUBCOMMITTEE. WE DON'T HAVE A MONEY PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN A PEOPLE PROBLEM. WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO FILL THE JOBS THAT THAT'S THE ISSUE WE SPENT FOUR HOURS YESTERDAY. TALKING ABOUT HOW WE SPENT LAST YEAR. ONE BILLION DOLLARS. TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN. TEACHERS WERE DOING BRING PEOPLE INSTRUMENT WHEN TO MAKE IT EASIER. TO GET THIS PERFECT PROFESSION WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO INTO PROFESSIONAL IT'S- UNSTABLE YET TO JUMP AROUND YOU HAVE TO GO TO COLLEGE FOR ADDITIONAL YEAR. IT AN ADDITIONAL- THAT DEBT LOAD. TO GET A JOB THAT PAYS LESS THAN YOUR FRIENDS GET WITH A FOUR YEAR DEGREE SO IT'S ALREADY SUPER HOW. COMPLICATED GET PEOPLE TAKE A JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THEN YOU KNOW RESPECTFULLY TO OUR VICE CHAIR. FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER- WE'VE SINCE. SINCE WE GOT ACTUALLY SINCE THE OTHER DOLLAR GOT HERE YOU'RE THE BETTER DOLLY OF COURSE. IS THE OTHER DOLLY GOT HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE. WE'VE DOUBLED SCHOOL FUNDING. DOUBLED LIKE THE PER PUPIL FUNDING IS DOUBLED WHEN WE WERE A DECADE AGO RED RECORD LEVELS OF SCHOOL FUNDING SO WE DO. NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM EIGHTY EIGHT GOING OUT IN THE FUTURE. VERY VERY EVEN MORE SO ROSY WITH THIS WHOLE BEGAN SITUACIÓN THE ONE THING THAT WE KNOW WILL WIN IN THE SITUATION SCHOOLS ARE MORE AND MORE MONIES TO GOING TO PROP THE IN OUR SCHOOLS WE JUST NEED TO GET PEOPLE. TO GO AND WORK IN THIS PROFESSION AND REALLY IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED SCHOOL DISTRICTS YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT MY SCHOOL DISTRICT WE DO THIS ANYWAY. 94% OF TEACHERS ANYWAY WE JUST HAVE THE SECOND TIER. RULES FOR PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THIS CATEGORY OF WORKING IN OUR SCHOOLS THIS IS BRINGS ABOUT A FAIRNESS AND I THINK THAT WE'VE WORKED TO FIND- A SOLUTION HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE ARAMBULA. GREAT THANK YOU I JUST JUST A COMMENT MR MCCARTY. I THINK WE DO HAVE A MONEY PROBLEM AND THAT IS WHERE THE MONEY GOES. THE SEVILLA PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR IT'S DRIVING MONEY AWAY IN THE CLASSROOM AND I JUST ROB NINETY EIGHT MONEY AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM AND I JUST THINK THAT'S TRAGIC I KNOW THE BUDGET IS AN EXERCISE. YOU'RE PART OF IT- BUT PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE NOTE THAT THE A LOT OF MONEY IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR IS NOT GOING INTO THE CLASSROOM WILL NOT BE SPENT ON TEACHING. RIGHT AND THAT TO ME IS A TRAGEDY WE NEED TO FUND THE BASE. SO WE GET TEACHERS RIGHT AND GET KIDS EDUCATE WORK WITH ON THAT YES THANK YOU FOR THAT I DO WE DO HAVE A MOTION. THIS LEE WHEN YOU MOVE.

FOR A PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH SEIZURES SEIZURE DISORDER OR EPILEPSY IF THE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM A SEIZURE THE VOLUNTEER WOULD BE TRAINED IN RECOGNIZING THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF SEIZURES IN THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO TAKE TO RESPOND TO THOSE SYMPTOMS THE VOLUNTEER WOULD ALSO BE PROVIDED WITH THE STUDENT'S INDIVIDUALIZED SEIZURE ACTION PLAN. WHICH WOULD INCLUDE INFORMATION FROM THE STUDENTS DOCTOR AND PARENTS. THERE ARE NEARLY SIXTY THOUSAND CHILDREN LIVING WITH EPILEPSY IN CALIFORNIA AND I AM THE FATHER OF ONE SEIZURES ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND CAN OCCUR ANYTIME INCLUDING DURING THE HOURS A CHILD IS AT SCHOOL. SCHOOL NURSES ARE TRAINED TO ADMINISTER MEDICATION BUT MAY NOT BE ON SITE OR AVAILABLE TO ADMINISTER ANTI SEIZURE MEDICATION WHEN ONE OCCURS CALIFORNIA HAS ENACTED SIMILAR LAWS FOR THE USE OF BENEFITING. FOR ALLERGIC REACTIONS ANILOX OWN FOR OPIOID OVERDOSES IN ADDITION TWELVE STATES ALREADY HAVE IMPLEMENTED VERSIONS OF THE SEIZURE SAFE SCHOOLS ACT AB EIGHTEEN TEN WOULD PROVIDE SCHOOL SITES WITH THE INFORMATION AND TRAINING NECESSARY TO AID CHILDREN LIKE MY SON.

VIVIAN STARTED KINDERGARTEN PERSON LAST APRIL A CHILD'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL IS EMOTIONAL STRESSFUL FOR ANY PARENT. FOR MY WIFE HILLARY IN MAY IT WAS ALSO TERRIFYING. IT'S NOT EASY LEAVING A SIX YEAR OLD EPILEPSY SOMEWHERE NEW WE BASICALLY NEVER DONE IT. WE WAITED OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL THAT ENTIRE FIRST DAY JUST IN CASE. WHEN IT WENT OFF WITHOUT A HITCH IN VIVIAN CAME OUT BEAMING AND PROUD WE WERE ECSTATIC. THE NEXT DAY I WAITED OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL AGAIN WE WEREN'T READY TO BE FAR AWAY.

I THANK HER AND ASK HER A LITTLE INCREDULOUS HOW DID YOU STAY SO CALM. AND SHE SAID. IT WAS ALL THE TRAINING WE KNEW WHAT TO DO. A WEEK BEFORE A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYEES AT VIVIAN SCHOOL HAD VOLUNTEERED TO ATTEND A BRIEF TRAINING. WITH A SCHOOL NURSE ON RECOGNIZING AND RESPONDING TO SEIZURES. THEY LEARN ABOUT WHAT'S YOUR LOOK LIKE. THEY LEARNED THAT IF YOU HAD A SEIZURE TO TURN AROUND OUR SITE AND PROTECTOR HAD. LEARNED WHEN IT WOULD BE TIME TO GIVE YOU HER MERCY MEDICATION. AND WE'RE THAT MEDICATION WOULD BE AND HOW TO USE IT. EVER IN THAT ROOM WAS PREPARED FOR A SEIZURE. THAT'S WHY THEY WERE ABLE TO STAY SO CALM. ND ALSO KEEP VIVIAN'S CLASSMATES COM. AVOIDING WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE THERE. AND THE NEXT DAY. OR THIRD DAY OF KINDERGARTEN.

OUR LAST BUDGET SAW HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN THE FORM OF A ONE TIME ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FOR DISPUTE PREVENTION TO ELEAZAR SELFIES BECAUSE OF INCREASED SPECIAL EDUCATION DISPUTES RELATED TO PANDEMIC SCHOOL DISRUPTIONS. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAD FOUR TIMES THE NATIONAL RATE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION LITIGATION BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. WITH EVERY DISPUTE WE RISK LOSING MUCH MORE THAN DOLLARS RELATIONSHIP AND TRUST WITH FAMILIES ARE DAMAGED OUR TIME AND ATTENTION IS THEN REFOCUS TOWARD LITIGATION. THE INVESTMENTS LAST YEAR PROVIDED MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES TO BEGIN-TRANSFORMING CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUUM OF ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND PREVENTION BUT MORE FUNDING AND EDUCATION ARE NEEDED TO CONTINUE THIS WORK. MANY OF US JUST RETURNED FROM THE SOP ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL EIGHTY OUR CONFERENCE IT WAS INSPIRING AS WE WITNESSED ACTUAL EXAMPLES OF HOW THESE DOLLARS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN REAL TIME.

STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS ARE REELING FROM THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL ISOLATION DISTANCE LEARNING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP AND MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS. THESE FUNDS ARE SO APPRECIATED. BUT AT THIS TIME MORE IS NEEDED. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT EDUCATIONAL TEAMS COMPOSED OF PARENTS STUDENTS TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AND SUPPORT STAFF NEED ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO COME TOGETHER TO BUILD TRUST IN THE SYSTEM TO RESOLVE THOSE DISAGREEMENTS DISPUTES AND CONTESTED RULINGS.

EIGHT THE MOTION IS BE ADOPTED TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR O'DONNELL HI DONNA HI SALLY SALLY I SENATE. BENNETT I CHEN N. I. LI LI I MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE QUIRK-SILVA SEVEN VOTED OUT THANK YOU WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK A CARILLO I WILL GO TO A FINE NUMBER ELEVEN. ELEVEN IS AB. TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY NINE WHICH WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONNECT FAMILIES IN NEED WITH NONPROFIT COMMUNITY VISION PROVIDERS SO THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE A FULL VISION EXAM AND GLASSES AFTER A REFERRAL FROM A SCHOOL NURSE. UP IS PRESENTED WITHIN THE CLASSROOM IS VISUAL AND STUDIES SHOW THAT INTERVENTION TO CORRECT THE CHILD'S VISION PROBLEM HAVE IMMEDIATE POSITIVE LEARNING OUTCOMES A CHILD COPING WITH AN UNCORRECTED VISION PROBLEM WILL LIKELY NOT ONLY EXPERIENCE LEARNING PROBLEMS BUT DISENGAGEMENT FROM EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AS WELL. THEY COULD EVEN EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL PAIN SUCH AS HEADACHES AND FATIGUE. INTERCEPTS BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY VISION PROVIDERS ARE ALREADY HAPPENING AND ARE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL. SCHOOL NURSES ARE TASKED WITH CONDUCTING VISION SCREENINGS AND WHERE THESE PARTNERSHIPS EXIST THE SCHOOL NURSE CAN THEN REFERRED THE STUDENT TO THE PROVIDER FOR A FULL EXAM AND GLASSES IF A PROBLEM. IS IDENTIFIED WHEN THIS HAPPENS FAMILIES IN NEED ARE RECEIVING A- SPECIALTY SERVICE FREE OF CHARGE THAT THEY MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ACCESS. BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE. THE TO SUCH A MEANINGFUL INTERVENTION LIKE THAT TO A CHILD IN MY COMMUNITY IS SOMETHING THAT I. CARE VERY DEEPLY ABOUT IN IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME. HOWEVER THERE IS A POINT OF FRICTION THAT WE NEED TO REMOTE. AND THAT IS THE PARENTS MUST OPT IN. ON A FORM THAT MUST BE RETURNED FOR THE EXAM. VISION EXAMS ARE NON INVASIVE PROVIDER SOME BACK ARE ALREADY BACKGROUND CHECKED. AND RECALL AS REQUIRED BY EXISTING LAW AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WITH DISTRICT STAFF PRESENT THIS BILL WILL STILL ENSURE THAT PARENTS ARE INFORMED OF THE AVAILABILITY. OF A VISION EXAM FROM A COMMUNITY PROVIDER HOWEVER. WE JUST CANNOT ACCEPT THE FATE OF A CHILD'S LEARNING OUTCOMES MAY REST ON A MISPLACED PIECE OF PAPERWORK. I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE THAT SERVE MY COMMUNITY AND CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THIS BILL. I WILL LET THEM INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. AT. SYSTEM AT THE IT SHOULD BE A WHITE BUT NO THIS IS MIKE OKAY. ENOUGH ABOUT IT. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON CHERO DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MERRY JANE PUFFER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES TRUST FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH. I REPRESENT AN INDEPENDENT BIBLE ONE SEE THREE SEPARATE JUST HEALTH AND EDUCATION TO ACHIEVE STUDENT WELLNESS. WE EFFECTIVELY WORK WITH SCHOOL STAFF AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO INTEGRATE CHILD HEALTH SERVICES. AND PROVIDE PREVENTION EDUCATION ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES BECAUSE WE KNOW DISTRICTS CAN'T DO THIS ALONE. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT AND AN ALLIANCE WITH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO THAT THERE ARE PROVIDERS READY TO SERVE. SUPPORT FOR OPT OUT EXAMS FOR VISION IS CRITICAL FOR VULNERABLE FAMILIES. WILL BE SCREENING MAY BE THE FIRST AND ONLY WAY THAT VISUAL COMPROMISE CAN BE DIAGNOSED. EARNING AN EXAMS ARE PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY THAT SUPPORTS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND IN THIS CASE THAT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS IS EDUCATION. DUNCE HAPPENS UNIVERSITY CONDUCTED A CLINICAL TRIAL FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN ANALYZING THE PERFORMANCE OF TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FOR STUDENTS IN GRADES THREE TO SEVEN. WHO RECEIVE SCREENINGS I EXAMS AND GLASSES. FOR CHILDREN'S RECEIVING FOR CHILDREN RECEIVING GLASSES READING SCORES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER ONE YEAR AND COMPARED TO THOSE WITH GLASSES AND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS SEEN IN ALL MATH AND ALL ELEMENTARY GRADES. THE CIVIC IMPROVEMENT FOR GIRLS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AND THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS WAS EVIDENCED AND ATTEMPT IT MADE A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR CHILDREN IN THESE CATEGORIES CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE VISION PROBLEMS I DON'T WANT STUDENTS ARE TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN NINETY NINE TITLE ONE STUDENTS TO HAVE AN UNDETECTED OR UNTREATED VISION PROBLEMS. REQUIRING PARENTAL CONSENT FOR NO COST VISION EXAMS CREATES AN UNNECESSARY BARRIER FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. UNLIMITED ACCESS TO CARE BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND VISION PROVIDERS. PARENTS MAY FORGET TO OR CANNOT RETURN THE PAPERWORK FOR A MYRIAD OF REASONS. BUT CHILDREN'S HEALTH SHOULD NOT PRE PAY THE PRICE. AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE REMOVES THOSE BARRIERS TO KERR. AND GRANTS ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL VISION VISION EXAMS. FOR THESE REASONS THE LOS ANGELES TRUST FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH IS IN FULL SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE AND WE HOPE FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU TO THE NEXT WHAT THE WITNESS GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON WILL SALAS DEAN I AM THE DIRECTOR OF WELLNESS PROGRAMS FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. BEFORE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR OUR DISTRICT AND OUR STUDENTS. ALL SENSES UNIFIED IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE VISION EXAMINATION PROVIDER- AND ALLOWS PARENTS TO OPT OUT. SCHOOL I HELP PROGRAMS INCLUDE SCHOOL BASS VISION SCREENINGS WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED BY OUR SCHOOL NURSES. A REFERRALS FOR EYE EXAMS THAT ARE EITHER SCHOOL BASED OR AN OUTSIDE ORGANIZATION. IN AN EYE GLASSES ARE DELIVERED. TO UNDERSCORE THIS POINT AN INCREASE IN VISION EXAMS DOES NOT TAKE WORK AWAY FROM OUR SCHOOL NURSES SAYS THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INITIAL SCREENINGS. IN THE EYE EXAMS ARE CONDUCTED BY OPTOMETRISTS. THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED EVERY STUDENT RECEIVES A VISION SCREENING A SPECIFIC GRADES AS REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW. HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO VISION EXAM STUDENTS ARE EITHER REFERRED TO OUTSIDE PROVIDERS ARE OFFERED SERVICES WITHIN A SCHOOL BY A VISION PROVIDER. WHILE I CONSENT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR SCREENING. CAROL CONSENT IS REQUIRED FOR AN EYE EXAMINATION. WELL SENDS UNIFIED FUNDS ONE FULL TIME AND TWO PART TIME OPTOMETRIST TO PROVIDE FREE VISION EXAMS AND GLASSES TO STUDENTS AT A FEW OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CLINICS. VISION PROVIDERS WHO HAVE ESTABLISHED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH LOS ANGELES UNIFIED ALSO PROVIDE FREE EYE EXAMS AND GLASSES TO STUDENTS. THE GOAL OF AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE IS TO PROVIDE MORE STUDENTS ACCESS TO NO COST VISION EXAMS BY ALLOWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE VISION EXAMINATION PROVIDER. AND THEN PROVIDE A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO GIVE PARENTS THE OPTION TO OPT OUT OF THE SCHEDULE VISION EXAM. BODY'S EXAM PROCEDURES ARE IN NON INVASIVE PARENTS WILL HAVE A CHOICE TO OPT OUT. IN ADDITION IT'S BILLS PERMISSIVE BUT THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DESIRE TO OFFER THESE PROGRAMS AND US IT DOES NOT CREATE A MANDATE IF DISTRICTS CHOOSE NOT TO LEVERAGE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. IF THE BILL PASSES LOS ANGELES UNIFIED IS HOPING TO DEVELOP A CONSENT. THERE WILL BE AN ELECTRONIC FORMAT IN ORDER TO ALLOW PARENTS AND CARE GIVERS TO EASILY ACCESS INFORMATION REGARDING THE AVAILABLE SERVICES AND TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS PLEASE SUMMARIZE. INCLUDING INCLUDING IN THE OPT OUT FORM. AND SO WITH THAT AGAIN LAW SAYS UNIFIED IS PROUD TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE AND WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEE NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SIGNOFF POSITION RIVER BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT IT. BILL MAKES A LOT OF COMMON SENSE THANK YOU BE SUPPORTING THE BILL A MOVE RECOMMENDED ACTION. MOVED AND SECONDED- ANY OTHERS. WE GATHER COMMENT COMMITTEE COMMENTS NOW WITH THAT ARE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I JUST WANNA SAY TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY INTO THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF INVESTMENT AND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ACTUALLY KATE THROUGH TWELVE PRESCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL AND ESPECIALLY THE WORK DONE TO ENSURE THAT. ALL OF THAT SUPPORT AN OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS ARE LANGUAGE THAT THEY MAY SPEAK AT HOME BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN OR DOES IT EVEN MATTER IF AT THE END OF THE DAY A CHILD SIMPLY CANNOT SEE THE BOARD IN FRONT OF THEM THE BOOK IN FRONT OF THEM AND CAN'T HAVE ACCESS TO LEARNING BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CANNOT READ THE WORDS IN FRONT OF THEM. I HAVE BEEN IN THE CLASSROOM I HAVE PUT GLASSES ON A CHILD AND HAVE SEEN THAT CHILD COMPLETELY TRANSFORM ALL ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIANS. AND UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT A CHILD'S ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO READ AND SEE THE BOARD AND SEE THE WORK IN FRONT OF THEM. WHAT ARE WE DOING. SO THIS IS A GOOD COMMONSENSE APPROACH. THESE PARTNERSHIPS ALREADY EXIST. AND MISTER CHAIR OF MOMENT PRIVILEGE I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK. AT CHAIRING THIS COMMITTEE THIS MAY BE THE LAST TIME THAT I PRESENT A BILL- BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS BODY SO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE TO AND THAT'S- THE NEEDS OF EDUCATION FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SEVEN AND A FRIEND OF THE COMMITTEE TEAR TODAY. I WOULD LIKE. TO BEGIN BY THANKING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND BY ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL INTO UNTIL THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE ACADEMICS A YEAR. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SEVEN WEST OF WILL STARTING IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE ACADEMIC YEAR LOWERED THE AGE OF WHICH POST SECONDARY TRANSITION PLANNING FOR STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS BEGINS FROM. AGE SIXTEEN DOWN TO AGE FOURTEEN FOR MANY YOUTH WITH AUTISM AND OTHER DISABILITIES THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD BEGINS WITH AN INTERVAL INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLAN OTHERWISE KNOWN AS AN I. E. P. UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. PLANNING IS NOT REQUIRED TO BEGIN UNTIL AGE SIXTEEN WHEN MANY STUDENTS ARE IN THEIR JUNIOR YEAR AS A RESULT THE STATE IS NOT PROVIDING STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING A DISABILITY WHAT THE ESSENTIAL TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE SKILLS FOR ADULT LIFE. AND THE TIME FOR SCHOOLS- PARENTS INSISTED SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP IT IS TIME I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT IT IS TIME FOR STORE. FIRST- FOR US SCHOOLS PARENTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP MEANINGFUL INDIVIDUALIZED TRANSITION PLANS. TO THAT END THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ESTABLISHED A STATEWIDE IP WORKING GROUP TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE. THE PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING IEPS FOR STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION ND RELATED SERVICES. THE WORKING GROUP DEVELOPED TWENTY FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE IP PROCESS. AND TO ENSURE THAT IT PEAS ARE DESIGNED AND- ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE STUDENT OUTCOMES. THIS INCLUDES RECORD I THIS INCLUDED- A RECOMMENDATION FOR CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TO REVISE THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE. TO ADJUST THE REQUIRED AGE FOR BEGINNING POST SECONDARY TRANSITION PLANNING FROM EIGHT SIXTEEN TWO EIGHT FOURTEEN. I AND NOTED THAT MOST US STATES AND TERRITORIES BEGIN TRANSITION PLANNING AT AGE FOURTEEN. AB TWO AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SEVEN WILL DO JUST THAT. FINALLY RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND IP'S CAN HELP STUDENTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION AND LIVE MORE INDEPENDENTLY AFTER GRADUATION. BY IMPLEMENTING THESE STRATEGIES TWO YEARS EARLIER CALIFORNIA WILL BEGIN TO SEE IMPROVED LONG TERM OUTCOMES. YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OUR VOTE AND I DO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MELISSA CORTEZ ON BEHALF OF AUTISM SPEAKS WHO IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL ALSO REGISTERING SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR AUTISM AND RELATED DISORDERS- AS THE ANALYSIS NOTED EARLIER TRANSITION PLANNING IS SUPPORTED BY A VARIETY OF STUDIES THAT SHOW HIGHER EMPLOYMENT RATES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO MENTIONED THE- STATE BUDGET BUDGET ACT AND TO THE WORKING GROUP WITH THAT RECOMMENDED THE AGE BE LOWERED TO FOURTEEN- THAT WORK GROUP WAS COMPRISED OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM C. D. E. THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES ELEAZER CELLPHONES AND OTHER RELEVANT EXPERTS SO REALLY THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT THIS POLICY WHO WERE IN THE WEEDS AND ARE LOOKING. AT WHAT THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOMES COULD BE MADE THIS RECOMMENDATION- LOWERING THE AGE TRANSITION PLANNING WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TIME TO IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS READINESS FOR AND STRENGTH RELATED TO. THE MANY TYPES OF TRANSITIONS IN THE I. E. P. IT'S ALSO CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW WHICH STATES THAT PLANNING FOR TRANSITION FOR SCHOOL TO POSTSECONDARY ENVIRONMENTS SHOULD BEGIN IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WELL BEFORE THE STUDENT LEAVES WITHOUT ALL THE FOR THE REST OF MY TIME TO KELLY HAS WORKED WITH. AUTISM SPEAKS. THANK HIM THANK HIM- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. MISTER CHAIRMAN AS VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M KELLY HAD TO COME ON THE STAFF OF AUTISM SPEAKS AND IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH US WE'RE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. THAT IS IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTISM COMMUNITY. OUR MAIN ACTIVITIES ARE TO FIND RESEARCH- PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT AND SERVICES. I'M PROMOTE AWARENESS AND ACCEPTANCE OF AUTISM AND ADVOCATE AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS ON A REALLY FOCUSED SET OF PUBLIC POLICY PRIORITIES. AMONG THESE A SPECIAL EDUCATION INCLUDING THAT REALLY IMPORTANT TIME FROM- ARTISTIC STUDENTS TRANSITION FROM PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION TO ADULT LIFE. AS YOU'VE HEARD STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT QUALITY TRANSITION PLANNING WHICH STARTS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND INCLUDES A KEY FOCUS ON PAID WORK INTERNSHIPS APPRENTICESHIPS- AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IS CORRELATED WITH BETTER OUTCOMES IN THEIR ADULT LIVES. ADDITION PLANNING SHOULD INVOLVE THE STUDENT AND THEIR IP TEAM VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION STAFF AND OTHERS WHO CAN HELP THEM- PLAN THAT THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES PLAN FOR RELEVANT. A POST SECONDARY EDUCATION HOUSING EMPLOYMENT AND SERVICE NEEDS. A MAJORITY OF STATES USE FOURTEEN NOW AS THE AGE- TO REQUIRED START OF PLANNING AND AS YOU'VE HEARD CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY IS THAT SIXTEEN. WHICH IS TYPICALLY SOPHOMORE TO JUNIOR YEAR SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ARCTIC SEA THIS- IN CALIFORNIA. STUDENTS WITH AUTISM AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OFTEN NEED ADDITIONAL PREPARATION AND ADJUSTMENT TIME THAN THEIR NEUROTYPICAL PEERS AND- THIS BILL WOULD HELP ADDRESS BATS. I'M GONNA SKI I WAS GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A STORY BUT YOU HAVE A VERY LONG AGENDA SO I'M GOING TO SKIP THAT AND JUST SAY THAT- WITH GOOD PLANNING AND PREPARATION SOME STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO ATTEND COLLEGE OR OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION MANY CAN WORK WITH OR WITHOUT ACCOMMODATIONS. I EVEN AS THEY MAY HAVE CONTINUING SERVICE NEEDS- AND- WE STRONGLY OR TO THE BILL AND URGE AND I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. I SEE NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS FOR MANY THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE HAVE A MOTION. AND MOVED BY THE VICE CHAIR AND SECOND WHY. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU AS A FORMER TEACHER AND A MOTHER OF A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD I CAN TELL YOU THAT- REGULAR EDUCATION STUDENTS NEED THIS AS WELL SO- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOUGHT. THANK YOU A PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM TWELVE AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL I'VE DONE ALL I DALLI. DALLI I'D BENNETT. BENNETT I CHEN N. I. LI. LEAI MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE QUIRK-SILVA QUIRK-SILVA I. AS SEVERAL SERVICE OUT THANK YOU. WITH THAT MOVE WILL NOT FILE ITEM SEVENTEEN AB TWO ZERO FIVE EIGHT BY O'DONNELL'S ANIL TURN OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR. AND. A READY MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU MATTER CHERRY PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWO ZERO FIVE EIGHT WHICH WILL STREAMLINE K. TWELVE CT PROGRAMS BY CONSOLIDATING TWO FUNDING STREAMS INTO A SINGLE PROGRAM AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND INCREASE THE LEVEL OF REGIONAL SUPPORT FOR THESE PROGRAMS. HIGH QUALITY CTE PROGRAMS IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS GAIN THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO ENTER THE WORKFORCE OR EMBARK ON POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING. THE STRENGTH OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY DEPENDS UPON A SKILLED WORKFORCE AND CTE PROGRAMS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF BUILDING THAT WORKFORCE. CURRENTLY SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO APPLY TO TWO SEPARATE PROGRAMS TO FUND THEIR CTE COURSES AND PATHWAYS. THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR SEATED AS WE CALL AROUND HERE. AT CD THAT'S WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH TYPICALLY HANDLES K. TWELVE MONEY- THE US STRONG WORK FORCE MONEY IS HANDLED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. I'VE I'VE DID I BELIEVE IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BE ADMINISTERING A K. TWELVE PROGRAM AND I REQUESTED AN AUDIT OF THE PROGRAM LAST YEAR THE THE AUDIT OF THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM THAT'S THE ONE ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE- THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THE AUDIT FOUND SEVERAL SHORTCOMINGS IN THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE APPLICATION OF GRANT SELECTION PROCESS LACK OF EQUAL ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPORT STAFF AS THERE IS ONE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER. FOR EACH OF THE SEVENTY TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY ELEAZAR ARE WITHIN THAT DISTRICT. SOME SELECTION COMMITTEES WERE FOUND TO HAVE INSUFFICIENT SAFEGUARDS AGAINST UNFAIR GRANT DECISIONS DUE TO INCONSISTENT SCORING. AS WELL AS AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST AS MEMBERS OF. THE SELECTION COMMITTEES MAY WORK FOR ELLIE AS APPLYING FOR GRANTS. OR CLEAR CONFLICT OF CONFLICT THERE AB TWO ZERO FIVE EIGHT ADDRESSES MANY OF THESE ISSUES BY COMBINING BOTH PROGRAM PROGRAMS INTO THE EXISTING SEATED PROGRAM UNDER CD. THIS WILL REDUCE THE BURDEN ON ELEAZAR BY REQUIRING A SINGLE APPLICATION AND THEN ANNUAL REPORT RATHER THAN MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS AND MULTIPLE REPORTS. ELEAZAR WILL BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THEIR AVAILABLE MATCH FUNDS BY DEDICATING THEM TO A SINGLE APPLICATION. RATHER THAN TRYING TO BALANCE BETWEEN TWO PROGRAMS. APPLICATIONS WILL BE SCORED CONSISTENTLY AT THE STATE LEVEL THEREBY AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FINALLY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED ON A REGIONAL BASIS BY K. TWELVE EDUCATORS FAMILIAR WITH THE ROLE OF C. T. E. WITHIN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. THESE CHANGES WILL ENSURE THAT STATE FUNDS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HIGH QUALITY CTE PROGRAMS AN EQUITABLE WAY. AND HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE AB TWO ZERO FIVE EIGHT R. DR BARBER AND I'M CO SUPERINTENDENT NAPPY KIDNAP ACCOUNTING COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND MERRY. A RESIDENT WHY DID US CG COORDINATOR AT THE MERCED COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU I CAN THROW THIS AWAY THE ASSEMBLY MEN SO THE PERFECTLY IT'S ALL IN THE BILL- HONESTLY I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THE MONEY WAS BIFURCATED IN THE FIRST PLACE WHY WOULD YOU TAKE MONEY FOR ONE PARTICULAR AREA AND MAKE PEOPLE WRITE TWO SEPARATE APPLICATIONS TO TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES THE STRONG WORK FORCE APPLICATION THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PARTICULARLY CUMBERSOME. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO WRITE REPORTS TO DO DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND EVALUATIONS IF I'M SORRY IT'S MADNESS- WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THE MONEY BACK WITH THE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND CTE PROGRAMS K. TWELVE. ALSO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HOLD BACK 30% OF THE MONEY UNTIL YOU'VE SPENT THE OTHER MONEY FIRST WHICH MAKES NO SENSE TO ANY OF US AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY IN THEIR- THEIR PROCESS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS SO IT'S ALL VERY NICE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF- FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR ADMINISTRATORS BUT THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD IN THE CLASSROOM. NO I KNOW YOU ALL SUPPORT C. D. E. AND YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT THAT KIDS GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY ARE CLUELESS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AFTER HIGH SCHOOL WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEXT YEAR I'M GOING TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHAT DO YOU STUDYING I DON'T KNOW. HE TO TAKE C. T. E. NO THEY HAVE AN IDEA AND MAYBE THE IDEA IS THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO BUT THAT'S GOOD TOO BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS NEED SOMEONE TO SPEND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE SENDING THEM TO COLLEGE TO MAJOR IN SOMETHING THAT THEN THEY FIND OUT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO. CZ IS CRITICAL LET'S MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR ELEAZAR TO GET THE MONEY AND TO RUN FOR PROGRAMS LET'S NOT MAKE IT HARDER DID YOU THINK WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PAPERWORK YOU KNOW IN OUR OFFICE WE. CALL THE LAST TWO YEARS PLAN DEMOCRATS. SO I SUPPORT THIS THAT MORE THAN I CAN SAY THANK YOU TELL. JOB WELL THAT'S GONNA BE HARD TO FOLLOW. I'M AS I WAS INTRODUCED MERRY WHY DID COORDINATOR- FOR THE MERCED COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAM PAST PRESIDENT OF THE C. A. R. O. C. P. AND ASSOCIATION CURRENT COLLEGE READINESS AND PRESIDENT ELECT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION. I'M HONORED TO HAVE DEDICATED THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN THE CLASSROOM AND IN ADMINISTRATION TO THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES AND ENHANCEMENT CITY BRINGS DECADES TWELVE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THE C. T. FILLED IS GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT AND THE DECISIONS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER R. DONNELL AND THIS COMMITTEE HAVE MADE TO BUILD BACK C. T. FUNDING AFTER L. CFF. PRIOR TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE. CO EASE THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION'S AND COOPERATIONS WITH CDP WERE RESPONSIBLE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ELLIE AS- REGARDING THEIR CTE PROGRAMS AND PATHWAYS. THIS WAS A NATURAL ROLE FOR CO EASE ESPECIALLY IN MY ORGANIZATION AND FOR THOSE CO YOU TO CONTINUE TO RUN TRADITIONAL RO PIECE. MANY OF THE C. ALWAYS PROVIDE SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO FUNDING SEVERAL CTE PATHWAYS NOT ONLY TO LARGER DISTRICTS BUT TO SMALLER AND RURAL SCHOOLS. THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTIES. C. ALWAYS HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING EXPERTISE AND HISTORY OF K. TWELVE C. T. WITH LONGSTANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CD AND ELLIE ACE IN THEIR COUNTIES. THIS FAMILIAR RELATIONSHIP POSITIONS THEM TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SUPPORT OF CTE PROGRAMS PATHWAYS AND THEIR REGIONAL AREA. THE TRANSITION TO K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE TECHNICAL SYSTEM MODEL HAS CAUSED SOME CONFUSION AND MISCOMMUNICATION IN THE FIELD. WITH SOMETIMES MULTIPLE K. TWELVE STRONG WORKFORCE PATHWAY COORDINATOR SERVING ONE COUNTY MESSAGES ARE OFTEN DILUTED CONTRADICTORY OR MISSING TO SOME ELLIE ACE. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER THE CURRENT MODEL DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF EXPERTISE OR HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS AND ARE IN EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED. WITH SOME COORDINATORS HAVING TEN ALLEY AS WHILE OTHER SERVE UP TO THIRTY EIGHT. THIS MODEL CONCENTRATES ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS RATHER THAN K. TWELVE DISTRICTS LEAVING SOME OF OUR RULE SCHOOLS WITHOUT THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND INFORMATION OF OTHER SCHOOLS IN OUR COUNTY. INSTANCE UNDER THE CURRENT CURRENT MODEL TO A MERCED COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS LOST% LONGSTANDING ARTICULATIONS AND EARLY CLLEGE CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION BASED ON THE COMMUNITY DISTRICT COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT LINES. THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF DIRECTION FOR MANY PATHWAY COORDINATORS LEADING TO INCONSISTENCIES AND DUTIES ACROSS THE STATE. THE C. O. E. T. A. M. TECHNICAL SYSTEM MODEL WILL BRING BACK NECESSARY CONSISTENT MESSAGING AND COOPERATION WITH CD TO SUPPORT K. TWELVE PATHWAYS MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT LEAVING SOME VALLEY AS WONDERING WHERE THEY FIT IN. AND FINALLY FOR CTE PATHWAYS TO MAINTAIN AND GROW IT'S A CENTRAL FOR ELLIE AS TO HAVE ACCESS TO ON GUN GOING STABLE FUNDING AND NOT BE DEPENDENT ON GRANT FUNDING THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE SUSTAINABILITY BEYOND THE THIRTY MONTHS I'VE EACH AWARD. WHILE THE C. T. FUNDING FORMULA IN C. T. ALLOCATIONS NEED REVISION FOR EQUITY AND INCLUSION FOR ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING COURT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS BILL WILL FIX THE ISSUES TO ENSURE AN EFFICIENT. AND IMPROVE SEATED PROCESS BENEFITING ALL MOVING FORWARD WITH SECURE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR C. T. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND PROBABLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM IN SUPPORT.

BUT ALSO A BIGGER FAN OF CONSOLIDATING AND STREAMLINING PROGRAMS I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING DIRECTLY TO STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS NOT TO MORE MORE. BUREAUCRACY OR ADMINISTRATION IN THAT SENSE AND I THINK WE'RE- YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE ALMOST MORE THAN DOUBLED OUR C. T. E. MONEY IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT GOES IN CLASSROOMS. GET SINCE PREPARE FUTURE EVEN A FEW. CITY SCHOOLS IN MY REGION AND SILICON VALLEY WHERE NOT EVERYONE WANTS BECOME A TECH PROGRAMMER.
