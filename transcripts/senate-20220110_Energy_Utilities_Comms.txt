THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL- WE WILL BEGIN NOW COURT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED LET'S NOW HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR WELCOME SENATOR WIENER- HE IS PRESENTING AN S. V. THREE SEVEN NINE. BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- I'M CALLING FOR LATER FIRST- THANK- THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS GIVEN THE TIGHT TIMELINE FOR JANUARY SESSION. I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THEM AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS BOTH FROM THE ENERGY COMMITTEE AND ALSO THE AMENDMENTS WE WORKED OUT WITH THE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE BUT LOGISTICALLY WERE UNABLE TO TAKE AS PART OF A COMMITTEE HEARING LAST WEEK SO EXCEPT ALL THOSE MOMENTS FROM BOTH COMMITTEES. ADDITIONALLY THESE AMENDMENTS WILL INCLUDE CHANGES- THAT WE WORKED OUT WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS CALVO- SPECIFYING THAT- MORE MAKING EXTRA CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THIS ONLY APPLIES TO RESIDENTIAL SOLAR PROJECTS WHICH IS ALWAYS THE INTENT OF THE BILL. AND ALSO EXEMPTING CITIES. WITH A POPULATION UNDER FIVE THOUSAND. PAUL AS YOU'LL HEAR IN THE CUSTOMER TODAY. ARE THESE CHANGES HAVE BROUGHT- CALVO AND THE LEAGUE OF CITIES- AS WE UNDERSTAND THAT TO A NEUTRAL. POSITION ON MEETING THAT AS FAR AS WE KNOW THIS BILL CURRENTLY HAS NO OPPOSITION- SO SP THREE SEVENTY NINE. REQUIRES JURISDICTIONS OF A CERTAIN SIZE TO IMPLEMENT ONLINE AUTOMATED ONLINE SOLAR PERMITTING PROCESSES FOR SIMPLE RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR AND SOLAR PLUS STORAGE SYSTEMS AND THIS ONLY APPLIES TO RESIDENTIAL AND IT ONLY APPLIES TO SIMPLE SYSTEMS ANY KIND OF COMPLEX LARGER SYSTEMS ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS BILL ANY COMMERCIAL- SOLAR SOLAR STORAGE IS NOT COVERED. BY THIS BILL- TO ACCOMMODATE THIS REQUIREMENT FOR CITIES LAST YEAR WE PLACED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET- FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GRANTS TO CITIES- FOR THE MODEST COSTS BUT THEY MAY ENCOURAGE IMPLEMENTING AUTOMATED SOLAR PERMITTING- THIS AUTOMATED SORE PERMITTING IS ONE OF THE MAIN METHODS FOR AVOIDING UNNECESSARY. DELAYS SAVING FINANCIAL AND STAFF RESOURCES AND INCREASING THROUGHPUT OF PERMITS. CURRENTLY SOLAR PERMITTING PROCESS THESE ARE ALL TOO OFTEN INEFFICIENT. THANK YOU INCREASE OFF COSTS BY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS THAT FRANKLY DROP OUT OF THE PROCESS BEFORE INSTALLATION. AND DETER POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS FROM ENGAGING IN A DRAWN OUT PROCESS TO GET TO OBTAIN A RESIDENTIAL SOLAR SYSTEM. AUTOMATED ONLINE SOLAR PERMITTING ALLOWS FOR A SIMPLIFIED AND FAR MORE EFFICIENT SOLUTION BY ALLOWING APPLICANTS. TO APPLY AND IMMEDIATELY RECEIVE A TERMINATION IF THEIR PROPOSED SYSTEM IS CODE COMPLIANT. OUR CURRENT AUTOMATED PERMITTING SYSTEMS ARE CAPABLE OF HANDLING FOURTEEN TIMES MORE PERMITS. THAN TRADITIONAL- PERMIT METHODS AUTOMATED SYSTEM SO IT'S 6100% INCREASE IN PERMITS THIS INCREASED VOLUME OF PERMITS IS NOT A BURDEN ON BUILDING DEPARTMENT STAFF HOWEVER. AS THE SYSTEMS ALLOW FOR SOLAR PERMITS- TO BE MANAGED AUTOMATICALLY- FURTHERMORE DEPARTMENTS WILL SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FEE COLLECTION. BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED PERMIT ACTIVITY- ALTHOUGH SP THREE SEVENTY NINE DOES NOT MANDATE A SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY OR SYSTEMS. OF THE BILL'S INTENT IS DIRECTLY TIED TO SOLAR OUT PLUS A RECENTLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE SYSTEM FROM THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LOTS OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. CREATED WITH STRONG EMPLOYER PARTICIPATION BY VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING BUILDING APARTMENTS SAFETY EXPERTS. SOLAR INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS AND SO FORTH. SO THERE ARE PLACES FREE AND OPEN SOURCE AND CAN BE EASILY IMPLEMENTED BY ANY JURISDICTION. BUILDING APARTMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO ON BOARD THE SYSTEM WITH ONLY AN EMAIL ADDRESS REQUIRED. AND EVEN MERGE THE PROGRAM WITH OTHER COMMONLY UTILIZED GOVERNMENT SOFTWARE IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY- IS COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SOLAR PLUS- AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED ALREADY. TO SUPPORT THE SOFTWARE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS- SOLAR UP PLUS SPECIFICATIONS ARE BASED ON MODEL BUILDING AN ELECTRICAL FIRE CODES. UNDER CROSS REFERENCE WITH THE LEADING PERMITTING GUIDEBOOKS IN CALIFORNIA MORE THAN FIFTY JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE SOFTWARE. AND CITIES- SUCH AS MODESTO MENIFEE OCEANSIDE IN PLEASANT HILL- VARIOUS STAGES OF ADOPTION NONE OF WHICH HAS COMMITTED AN ISSUE. IN ADDITION SAN JOSE. LOS ANGELES AND OTHER CITIES HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED SOLAR UP CLOSE- MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE B. THREE SEVENTY NINE AS A CLIMATE BILL- AND WILL HELP US GET TO OUR GOAL. OF A THAT NUMBER NEEDS TO TRIPLE IN THE NEXT DECADE IF WE EXPECT TO MEET CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. OTHERS WILL ALSO INCREASE RESILIENCY DURING WILDFIRES AND OTHER DISASTERS- COLLEAGUES- THIS IS A BILL WHOSE TIME HAS COME. I RESPECT LAST YEAR I WROTE. TODAY WITH ME TO TESTIFY OR NOT TO SETTLE WITH SUSAN G. FOR POLICY AS PER ONE OF OUR- SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND LARGELY IN THE STATE DIRECTOR AT ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA. OR OTHER CO SPONSORS THANK YOU.

THREE SEVENTY NINE CONFINEMENT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOLAR NOT STATE. YOU CAN MAKE IT QUICKER AND CHEAPER TO INSTALL SIMPLE RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR SYSTEMS DESPITE POSSIBLY JUST LATER PERFORMANCES DON'T COST TOO MUCH AND TAKES TOO LONG TO CUT MADE IT SIMPLE RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR SYSTEM COSTING THE TYPICAL. CUSTOMIZABLE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE SOLUTION IS TO ON THIS. OF TALKING TO DURING THE SYMBOLS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AUTOMATED THE PERMITTING THE RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR SYSTEMS THE CITY'S APPROVAL PUNDITS POLITICAL PUNDITRY REVENUE AND INSTALLED MOST MOST ALERT AS A RESULT. S. B. THREE SEVENTY NINE DIRECT CITIES AND COUNTIES OVER CERTAIN POPULATION THRESHOLDS. INCREMENTAL TO MAKE THE PERMITTING PERSONAL RESIDENTIAL. ROOFTOP SOLAR SYSTEMS. IMPORTANTLY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS I WOULD NEEDED EMAIL TO SIGN UP TO USE THE CELL LAPTOP PLUS SYSTEM WHICH IS FREE SOFTWARE DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION WILL ALSO HAVE A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAMS WILL BE FUNDED OUT OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TO COMPENSATE JURISDICTIONS AT ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOCTOR WILL TO MAKE. THIS BILL IS NOT AN UNFUNDED MANDATE. WITH SP THREE SEVENTY NINE CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE MAJOR STRIDES TO POWERING UP STATE WITH A 100% CLEAN ENERGY AT NO ADDITIONAL COST.

THE TOP BILLER IN THE MOST POPULAR KIND OF ENERGY AND IN THE STATE- BUT OUR POTENTIAL TO EXPAND ROOFTOP SOLAR IT'S REALLY ENORMOUS- WE COULD MEET THREE QUARTERS OF OUR EIGHT OUT I THINK YOU NEED. JUST BY CATCHING THE SIGN ON EXISTING ROOFTOP ACCORDING. TO THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB. THANK YOU PROCESS. FILLER PERMIT HAS OVER BURDEN LOCAL. WITH OUR OF P. WORK.

AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I MOVE THE BILL. BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT. IT IS WE IN THIS LEGISLATURE STEP BACK AND TRY TO DEAL WITH MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE. THE FRUSTRATION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS IN DEALING WITH GOVERNMENT AND A SLOW AND DIFFICULT IT IS WHETHER IT'S BUILDING HOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR WHATEVER ELSE IT MAY BE. WHAT THIS NATION DOES IT'S IMPORTANT LESSON TO ALL OF US. HERE IT IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKING IN COORDINATION WITH US TO CREATE THE DEATH ROW THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABS. THAT CREATE A PLAN THAT AUTOMATES PLAN REVIEW PROMOTES A- CODE COMPLIANT APPROVALS AND ISSUES PERMITS. FOR SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS. IT WAS SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS. THAT IS ONE SMALL STEP FOR GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND NOW WITH SENATOR WIENER'S MEASURE STATE GOVERNMENT WORKING TOGETHER WE SAUCE PRESIDENT CLINTON DO THIS ON MARCH FOURTH TWO THOUSAND WHEN HE GAVE ACCESS TO THE SATELLITES THAT THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WERE USING THAT WE NOW HAVE WITH ALL OF OUR PHONES SO WE CAN USE OUR GPS SYSTEMS. AND SO I SHARE THIS. BILL FOR US THAT APPEARS TO BE A SMALL STATEMENT IN A VERY BIG ISSUE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE UNIFORMS A LEVEL OF THINKING THAT WE SHOULD ALL ENGAGE IN. IN TERMS OF FINDING PLACES WHERE GOVERNMENT AT EVERY LEVEL CONGLOMERATE AND WE CAN DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL FRUSTRATIONS AND FUNDAMENTAL PUBLIC POLICY PROBLEMS THAT WE DEAL WITH SO AGAIN I STAND IN SUPPORT AND APPLAUD THE- AUTHOR FOR HIS. EFFORT IN THIS REGARD AND HOPE THAT THIS IS JUST ONE SMALL STEP FOR US IN GOVERNMENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO HAVE APPROVALS ON IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY AREAS. LIKE HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AMONG OTHER AREAS THANK YOU. ONE SMALL STEP FOR GOVERNMENT AND ONE LARGE STEP FOR MANKIND THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY ELOQUENT WORDS- WHAT ELSE- CENTER GROVE. WELLS ANYONE ELSE VACANCY HAND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU S. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GO I THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IF- THESE PROJECTS WERE APPROVED FASTER BUT I DO HAVE A CONCERNS WITHIN THE DISTRICT AND- JUST OUTSIDE OF MY DISTRICT IN THE NORTHERN AREA. FOR INSTANCE- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS ASKED WITH FRESNO WITH ONE OF PERMITS ISSUED ONLINE THERE'S NO WAY TO VERIFY THE STRUCTURE IS FULLY. PERMITTED WHERE THE SOLAR WILL BE INSTALLED. THIS COULD CAUSE A PROBLEM- WHEN A FINAL INSPECTION AS REQUESTED. SO WHEN ANY PERMIT IS ISSUED IN FRESNO THE PLANNING STAFF REVIEWS A SITE PLAN AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO OUTSTANDING ISSUES ON THE PROPERTY. PRISON WAS ALSO NOT DIGITIZED THE RECORDS OF RESEARCH CAN TAKE SOME TIME- WE'LL LOCALS AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OR THE HAVE THE FINAL PERMITTING. PROCESS IN THIS LEGISLATION YES SIR- THROUGH THE CHAIR. ON A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL WHEN SOMEONE FIRST OF THIS BILL. DOES NOT IN ANYWAY TAKE AWAY CITIES ABILITY TO CONDUCT A PHYSICAL INSPECTION. SURVEY IF THERE'S SOME SORT OF SAFETY ISSUE- SOME SORT OF STRUCTURAL ISSUE THAT'LL COME OUT AN INSPECTION AND THEY DISPOSED NOT TAKE AWAY THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT. IN ADDITION AND THE PERSON THE AUTOMATED PERMITTING PROCESS. THEY HAVE TO ANSWER THE CONTRACTOR WHOEVER IS INSTALLING. HAS THE ANSWER I BELIVE IT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE QUESTIONS TO ENSURE. FULL COMPLIANCE AND SO A LOT OF ISSUES FOR WELL IT THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE QUESTIONS. AND THEN OF COURSE THEY CAN STILL DO A PHYSICAL INSPECTION THEY'RE VERY ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL- WE CHANGED THE PHYSICAL INSPECTION. TO A VIRTUAL INSPECTION THAT CAUSED SOME. CONSTERNATION AND SO WE REMOVE THAT PART BILL PREVIOUSLY- SO THAT. THE THAT'S I CAN RESP- TO THE THANK YOU AND AN WORK. AT IT MY UNDERSTANDING IT I AM ALL THE THIS IS WAS RE FROM THIS BUT YET WAS UP. TO STILL BY COW BUILDING IF. CAN GO- YES THE CAL. BILL INTO. SO DAY. S. TOMB. AND EXCHANGE WOULD DROP THEIR PERSON. WE TAKE BOTH AMENDMENTS AND YOU KNOW. WERE ACCEPTING.

THAT TESTIMONY WAS A LITTLE BIT I BELIEVE HE AID THAT HE'S DROPPING HIS OPPOSITION ALTHOUGH IT WAS. IT WAS GARBLED BUT ONCE IT GOES INTO PRINT MY UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT THEY WILL DROP THEIR OPPOSITION AND THE LEAGUE OF CITIES IS ALSO AS I UNDERSTAND IT GOING TO DROP ITS OPPOSITION. ONCE THE AMENDMENTS ARE IN PRINT. THANK YOU SIR. WE'LL GO TO SENATOR BECKER.
