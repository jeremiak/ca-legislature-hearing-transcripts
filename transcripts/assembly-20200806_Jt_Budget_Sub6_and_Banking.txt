AGAIN A GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO OUR JOINT HEARING WITH THE BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION. WE KNOW THE PROPOSAL HAS CHANGED SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET THIS HEARING WAS SCHEDULED IN MARCH BUT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WE ARE NOW GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY SURE THE PROPOSAL- WE HAVE MISSED THE BOAT HOOKS CHILDREN. WAKING COMMITTEE AS OUR CULTURE AND ANY MEMBER WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE MAKE OPENING REMARKS WE CAN OFFER THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THEIR MARK. THE ME KNOW JUMP IN. STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK IN GUIDING US THROUGH THE MOST CHALLENGING BUDGET PROCESS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION THE SPEAKER AND THE PRO TEM FOR AGREED TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS IMPORTANT PROPOSAL TO STRENGTHEN CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CHAT AS OF THE STATE BUDGETING IS DEALING WITH ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WHICH CAUSE REDUCTIONS REVENUE AT THE SAME TIME THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN THE SAME TIME THE CONSTITUENTS NEED EVEN MORE HELP. BUT THE PROPOSAL THAT WILL HERE TODAY IS BOTH TIMELY AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY GENERAL FUND SPENDING. MEANING THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT PRESENT A TRADE UP WITH OTHER IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS LIKE EDUCATION PUBLIC HEALTH OR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TIMES OF ECONOMIC STRESS CALIFORNIANS DESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND HONESTLY BY FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. AND THIS PROPOSAL WILL GIVE THE STATE BETTER TOOLS TO WORK TOWARD THAT GOAL. AT BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT RECORD NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS ABOUT. PRODUCTS LAST MONTH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE SEEN MORE THAN A 40% INCREASE IN CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. CALL THE AN INJURIES. ON THE ON SINCE THE ONSET OF COBIT NINETEEN. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU HAS REPORTED NEW RECORDS OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS EACH SINCE MARCH AN OVERALL COMPLAINTS ARE UP 50% FROM SINCE LAST YEAR. THOSE COMPLAINTS VAN FROM A RANGE OF TO DEBT COLLECTION MORTGAGES STUDENT LOANS AND VEHICLE FINANCING. AND I FEAR THE PROBLEMS ARE ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE AS WE ENTER THE MOST TROUBLING STAGE OF THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS DUE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO EXTEND ENHANCED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THAT. WORK WILL KEEP MORE FAMILIES AFLOAT. THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION HAS CLEARLY SHOWN AS THAT WE CANNOT RELY ON THEM TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THE CFPB HAS TRANSFORMED FROM AN AGENCY WITH A CLEAR MISSION OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS INTO AN AGENCY THAT'S CAPTURED. BY THE INDUSTRY AND IS. IT THE INDUSTRY THAT IS INTENDED TO REGULATE. BUT WE DO NOT RELY ON THE FED IN THE SPACE THE DODD FRANK ACT WHICH CONGRESS PASSED IN THE LAST CRISIS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZES STATE LEGISLATORS. TO SERVE STATE LEGISLATURES TO SERVE AS FRONT LINES OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS WE ARE NOT GRANTING THE STATE ANY NEW FOR MORE AUTHORITY WE'RE SIMPLY ALLOWING A STATE AGENCY TO APPLY UNDER EXISTING AUTHORITY UNDER FEDERAL LAW. LAST YEAR INTRODUCED BILL TO START THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION A STRENGTHENING OUR CAPABILITIES AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE BANKING COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN OR WE HEARD FROM FEDERAL LEADERS LIKE FORMER CFPB. DIRECTOR RICHARD CORDRAY. SUBSEQUENT THAT WE TO SHAPE A VAGUE CONCEPT INTO A SPECIFIC SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. THE GOVERNOR'S INCLUSION OF THE PROPOSAL IN HIS LAST JANUARY BUDGET PROVIDED A PATHWAY FOR DB O. TO RECEIVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND AUTHORITY TO CARRY OUT A RENEWED VISION OF PUTTING THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS FIRST. THE PROPOSAL WITH THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US TODAY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH OUR STATE AS A LEADER IN THIS SPACE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO GIVE NEEDED SUPPORT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. I HOPE THAT OUR CONVERSATIONS IS NOT SIMPLY FOCUS ON THE PERCEIVED BURDEN IT MIGHT ADD TO INDUSTRY AND INSTEAD WE ENGAGE AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN AND SHOULD MAKE THIS WORK FOR ALL PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION INTO ADVANCING THIS IMPORTANT AND TIMELY PROPOSAL. THANK YOU CHARLIE MON ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. MR GABRIEL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU ALSO TO OUR BANKING CHARGE MY COLLEAGUES FOR INDULGING ME IN SOME OPENING COMMENTS I- UNFORTUNATE HAVE TO DEPART A LITTLE BIT SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS BEFORE- BEFORE I HIT THE ROAD- FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO SAY THAT I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE I THINK THIS IS RIGHT PART WHAT. WITH OUR BANK THE CHAPLAIN NIGHT AS A SORT OF ACCIDENT OF GEOGRAPHY AND AGE HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE OF THIS. THAT WERE INVOLVED. IN ABOUT AGENCY. AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD WORK THAT IT DID IN ITS EARLIER SINCE I. REALLY BELIEVE THAT HAVING STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS HAVING A STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT I REGRET IN SOME WAYS THAT IT BECAME A PARTISAN ISSUE IN WASHINGTON DC I DON'T THINK THE CONSUMER PROTECTION SHOULD BE A PARTISAN ISSUE I DON'T THINK THAT. PROTECTING FOLKS FROM PROPER BUSINESS PRACTICES OR DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. SHOULD BE SOMETHING IT SHOULD BE A- CAUSE FOR DISAGREEMENT I THINK THAT KIND OF THING THAT. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS DO. SO CAN BE AS- AS- THIS. I DID WANT. REALLY A PART OF IT COMMITTEE CHAIR FOR. INTRODUCING BASED ON THE SIZE. OF GETTING. PROCESS CONCERTS HERE- YOU KNOW I'M I'M SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT PROCESSMATTERS THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. A GREAT IDEA AND A GREAT DAHLE BETWEEN- BUT AND- YOUR THE DETAILS MATTER POLICY MAKING IN THE TO HAVE LET'S JUST HAVE. REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION THAT THAT WORK WE'VE GOT A- GOT TO REALLY HAMMER OUT THE DETAILS AND I AGREE WITH THE L. A. R. BUT THIS ISN'T. REALLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD GO THROUGH THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH- AND THE COMMITTEE PROCESS WITH WITH COLLEAGUES. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF- A LOT OF MEMBERS WHO HAVE AN OF THE OPPORTUNE TO FOCUS ON THE DETAILS HERE SOME GLAD WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS HEARING TODAY- BUT I REALLY DO. HOPE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO. FURTHER DEVELOP THIS THROUGH. LOS CENTER I JUST LIKE. TO THE LARGEST. STAMP ON ON THIS WORK IN FOR WHERE THAT LEAVES ME IS B. A STRONG SO OF THIS OF BELIEVING THAT IN THE- CAN'T H. CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY- BUT I THINK WHAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO NEED TO BE ENGAGED AND PROVIDE STRONG GUARDRAILS AND DIRECTION AND OVERSIGHT AND JUST TURN OVER THE KEYS TO AN AGENCY TO THE ADMINISTRATION. I JUST LIKE HAS A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS PROCESS. I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT- AND SO AGAIN I JUST WANT TO. YOU KNOW URGE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PLAY A REALLY ACTIVE ROLE IN THIS PROCESS SO. YOU TO THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF THIS AGENCY I THINK THAT THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL BEFORE HE'S GONNA HAVE A STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY. WE'RE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I REALLY REALLY APPLAUD THE INTENT HERE- AND BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT IDEA. AGAIN I THINK THE PROCESS REALLY MATTERS AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH SOME CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD FROM HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR STILL. THE CHAIR AND I TOO WOULD LIKE TO THANK LIMóN FOR THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE I SHARE SOME OF THE KIDS ARE TALK TO SO THE PROPONENTS AND THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL AND I DO. WORRY THAT THE WAY THIS WAS BROUGHT TO US THIS YEAR. IT JUST KIND OF TALK TO THE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE SETS A BIT OF AN ALARMING PRECEDENT. HOWEVER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHERUB OF BANKING AND FINANCE WE HAVE HEARD. ABOUT THIS IDEA WE'VE HAD HEARINGS ON THIS IDEA. WE HAVE HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO FRAME WHAT ULTIMATELY IS BEFORE US HERE TODAY AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR CHIRLA MOANS INVOLVEMENT IN THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE- LOOKING AT AND IT WILL BE A PART OF THI. BUDGET TRAILER BILL- I WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT US JUST TAKING LANGUAGE AND THEN PASSING IT ON. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE CHAIR HAS BEEN. A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART OF CRAFTING THIS BASED ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE. SO WE IN FACT HAVE PUT OUR STAMP. ON HOW THIS. BUDGET TRAILER BILL IS MOVING FORWARD. IT DES NEED TO BE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT DOES NEED TO BE MADE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BUDGET COMPONENT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO GENERAL FUND. THERE ARE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS TO THIS BECAUSE THE WAY THE STATE COLLECTS AND DISTRIBUTES MONEY. FOR MEMBERS I WILL TELL YOU THIS IS PROBABLY Vì MOST SIGNIFICANT. PIECE OF POLICY. WE COULD BE DOING TO BENEFIT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY IT'S GOING TO BECOME HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER TO PASS. WE'RE NOT ADDING LAYERS OF REGULATION WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS GIVING APPROPRIATE TOOLS TO OUR REGULATE. TO GO AFTER THOSE WHO ARE WHO ARE PREYING ON CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. WITH FINANCIAL APPLICATION THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN MISSING SINCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO BACK OFF ON ITS PROTECTION OF CONSUMER SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR IT AND THE ADMINISTRATION I HOPE IS HEARING US LOUD AND CLEAR ABOUT HOW THEY BRING FOR. TO A HAD WE NOT BEEN SO INVOLVED AND HAD SUCH AN ABILITY TO FRAME WHAT THIS IS I THINK IT MIGHT END UP WITH A DIFFERENT RESULT SO WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT LOSING THIS OPPORTUNITY HERE. TO DO OUR BEST FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THAT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY NEED TO DO SO I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. ABSOLUTELY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IDEA ALL ALONG I'VE BEEN A PART OF ALL OF THE HEARINGS AND THE CONVERSATIONS. THAT WE CREATE THIS MECHANISM IN CALIFORNIA TO BENEFIT CONSUMERS SO I'M HOPING WE DON'T GET LOST IN SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND THAT BECOMES A SMOKE SCREEN. FOR US TO DO WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT FOR. MEMBERS SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BEAR THIS OUT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. INSPIRATION AND THANK GOD CHAIRWOMAN RAMON FOR HER WORK ON THIS AND BRINGING IT FORWARD AT THIS TIME YOU KNOW I HAVE- I THINK I PROBABLY HAVE THE RECORD I'VE SERVED ON THE BANKING COMMITTEE SINCE I CAME HERE SO I'M BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE LONGER THAN ANY OTHER OF MEMBERS THE ASSEMBLY RIGHT NOW IS A BIT ON THE COMMITTEE NOW FOR EIGHT YEARS AND- IN A MATTER HOW MUCH LEGISLATION WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO MOVE FORWARD AND TO WORK HARD ON WE HAVE MET MARC AND TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS. AT UP. THEN WE THE MANY MANY PROGRAMS WERE IF WE HAD HAD SOME KIND OF PROTECTION IN PLACE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF YOU KNOW WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF LIKE OUR PACE PROGRAM WHERE WE HAD YOU KNOW LOTS AND LOTS OF FOLKS IN MISINFORMATION. PEOPLE BASICALLY GETTING OFF TO ONE ELATED AND AS A RESULT WE HAD IT TOOK US A LONG TIME TO REALIZE HOW MUCH DAMAGE THAT WAS BEING DONE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOSING THEIR HOMES. BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THERE HAD BEEN NO REAL. OVERSIGHT WITH REGARDS TO THE PROGRAM UNTIL. IT WAS SO FAR AWAY ALONG THE PEOPLE WHO WERE REALLY DAMAGED BY IT AND WE NEED SUBSTANTIVE REGULATIONS. WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION IN THE COMMUTE. A BEFORE AND SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S BROUGHT TO YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A CONCEPT AND THIS ITEM DONE ON IT. STILL WORK TO BE DONE. IT TIME IN. WHICH WE REALLY NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS. WHAT'S I WOULD NOT SHORT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE STATEMENT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD SO I'M NOT IT WOULD HEARING WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE SEEN THIS BEFORE AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AND HE'S BEEN A VAST WITH TIME IN THE BANKING COMMITTEE TRY SURFING THAT CONSUMERS WE GET SO FAR AND BECAUSE OF ALL THE TECHS IN THE STEP HAPPENS NOW TO MOVE OFFSHORE WE DO A LITTLE. I HAVE NOTHING ONE THING THE- THIS IS. WORKING ON IT. SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO WE HAVE TO DO- AND WE NEED TO WORK ON IT AND THEN THERE'S STILL MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND THAT'S THE GOOD. THING ABOUT. THIS PROPOSAL THAT WE STILL TIME TO REALLY. DO SOME WORK ON IT EVEN IF IT'S PUT INTO OUR BUDGET PROCESS THERE'S ALSO. POLICY BASIS STILL. WORK OUT SOMEONE THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU MR ABOUT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE CHAIRWOMAN FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING I THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND DOES MISS STONE MENTION IT'S A BIPARTISAN ISSUE CONSUMER PROTECTION IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENFORCE AND- I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS JUST ON BOTH THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER CAN COMMITTEE AND THE BEST. I WAS NOT HAPPY FOR BILL. IN THOSE COMMITTEE. I CONSUMER AND TRYING FIGURE OUT WHY THE APPROPRIATE LINE IS BETWEEN ALLOWING BUSINESSES FREEDOMS TO INNOVATE ON BUSINESS PRACTICES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DO OUR JOBS AND PROTECT THE CONSUMERS THAT WE REPRESENT. SO BY THAT IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOPIC- AS WE GO THROUGH THIS HEARING TODAY I'M GONNA BE FOCUSED ON TO CONCERNS THAT I WITH THIS PROPOSAL FOR IT THAT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE. THE GOVERNOR IS ASKING WE SPEED UP ACTUAL AMOUNT OF FOR. AS A LEAD. SECOND BRANCH. BY CAN ABOUT THAT IS THAT I THINK THAT WE SERVE A VALUABLE PURPOSE IN TRYING TO MAKE THESE WEIGHTY DECISIONS AND I'M VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT. GIVING THAT AUTHORITY TO ESSENTIALLY UNELECTED BUREAUCRACY AND EMPOWERING THEM TO DO THE JOB THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE EMPOWERED TO DO THAT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF BEING NOT ONLY LAST PRESENT BUT ALSO BLESSED CURRENT SO ARE. ABOUT THAT AND I THINK WE TO BE VERY CAR ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THE WORK WE GIVE. AT MUCH OF THE RETRAIN OURSELVES BECAUSE THOSE COMMITTEES THAT I JUST MENTIONED EVERY YEAR WE SPENT. HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS OF HOURS% LISTENING TO TESTIMONY AND WEIGHING THESE DECISIONS AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S THERE'S VALUE IN THAT TRANSPARENCY IN THAT PROCESS. AND THEN MY OTHER CONCERNS THAT OUR WORK WE'RE TAKING UP THIS ISSUE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN WORKED ON FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. BUT LEGISLATORS TAKING UP THIS ISSUE SO LATE IN THE PROCESS THIS YEAR. I MEAN WE HAVE LITERALLY WHAT THREE WEEKS LEFT IN OUR SESSION. BUT IT'S SO I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS MR GABRIEL EXPRESSED THAT. FOR THE PERHAPS WERE SHORT CUTTING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND WE'RE NOT. GOING TO BE DELIVERED. AN ISSUE THAT'S THIS WEIGHTY THAT WE MAKE GOOD DECISIONS SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING HERE AND- LOOKING FOR THE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COLLEAGUES MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. SINAN LET'S MOVE TO OUR FIRST PANELIST WE HAVE COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT COMMISSION OFFERS. GOOD MORNING JERRY TANG CHAIRMAN ON AN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. MY NAME IS MANUAL ALVAREZ THE COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. PRIOR TO SERVING MY CURRENT ROLE I SERVED IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CAPACITIES OFF AS A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ATTORNEY. ON BEHALF OF THE STATE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS A GENERAL COUNSEL TO A FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANY- WHERE I ADVISED THE EXECUTIVE TEAM AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ABOUT HOW TO NAVIGATE. HE AND FEDERAL LAW AND- HOW TO INNOVATE. WHICH IS ALL TO SAY THAT THIS TOPIC OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ON THE ONE HAND AND NNOVATION ON THE OTHER. ONE IS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. AND I DO NOT SEE. I DO NOT SEE THEM AS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE PRINCIPLES. I WANT TO THANK THIS BODY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO DISCUSS THIS ONCE AGAIN WITH YOU SENSE LAST HEARING IN MAY. IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR HIGHLIGHTED THE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO BETTER PROTECT IT SOME CONSUMERS. IT IS EVEN MORE URGENT TODAY. WE KNOW THAT THE RECOGNIZE THIS TO AS MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN LEADERS AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND IT KNOWLEDGE THIS PROPOSAL CONTINGENT FUNDING IN THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET PASSED JUNE. SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DE PRIORITIZED CONSUMER PROTECTION. SHUDDERING CONSUMER PROTECTION EFFORTS AND REWRITING OR SCUTTLING KEY RULES THAT OFFERED INCREASED CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. SINCE THE ONSET OF THE COVE IT CRISIS. DVO HAS RECEIVED A 40% INCREASE IN CALLS AND COMPLAINTS. AND THOSE ARE JUST THE CONSUMERS WHO FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIND US. AND WE'RE NOT EVEN THROUGH THE WORST PART OF THE ECONOMIC RECESSION YEAH. LAST GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES HERE WHY DON'T WE WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR. THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION. BUT THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. AND BECAUSE- IT FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE TREMENDOUS INPUT AND EXPERTISE THAT IS ALREADY BEEN PROPPED THERE AT WORK SPEED. AND QUICK SUMMARY THE PROPOSAL IN THE LANGUAGE HAVE BEEN POSTED SINCE JANUARY THIRTY ONE WE AT THE DEPARTMENT HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS IN CONSULTATION WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS. TO CLARIFY ELEMENTS AND RESOLVE CONCERNS RAISED BY MEMBERS THERE IS- AND I OF COURSE WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAMONT. WISE GUIDANCE AND COUNSEL THROUGHOUT US. IF WE WAIT LONGER MY FEARS OF CALIFORNIANS WILL GO THROUGH THE WORST PARTS OF THIS RECESSION. WITHOUT IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. THIS FINANCIAL CRISIS THREATENS TO HAVE A LONG TAIL. AND AS WE ARE LEARNING PROBLEMS WITH THE LONG TAIL. REQUIRE DECISIVE ACTION EARLY ON SO THAT WE CAN BEND THE CURVE OF FUTURE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS. WHAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES IS IT ADDS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION TO THE LIST OF AGENCIES THAT CAN ENFORCE CRITICAL PROVISIONS OF DODD FRANK. AND IT WOULD GIVE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION CRITICAL MARKET MONITORING CAPABILITIES TO DRIVE SMARTER REGULATIONS INTO WORK IN A DATA DRIVEN FASHION IN BETTER AND BETTER FASHION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. DODD FRANK STATES THAT FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATORS HAVE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE CERTAIN YOU DEBT PROVISIONS UNDER THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT. IN THIS PROPOSAL SIMPLY MAKES EXPRESS THE DEPARTMENTS AUTHORITY IN THIS AREA. THE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT NEW THE REMEDIES ARE NOT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT THREE CONCERNS THAT SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAVE RAISED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. FIRST YOU TO. AS NOTED THIS IS NOT A NEW LAW IN ALL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCT OR SERVICE PROVIDERS SHOULD ALREADY BE COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW AND THEIR COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS SHOULD ALREADY BE ADHERING TO THESE SPOT STANDARDS. IT SHOULDN'T BE SCARY IT NEEDED TO BE SCARY. THIS PROPOSAL MERELY PROVIDES CONSUMERS ANOTHER ASKING FOR PROTECTION AND COMPLAINTS. SECOND INCUMBENT LICENSEES HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LAW AND ITS ORGANIZATION AND HAVE NEW USED AND HOW NEW YOU DON'T PROVISIONS WOULD APPLY TO. I AM- I AM HAPPY TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR INCUMBENT LICENSEES- AND I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO WORK THIS OUT IN SHORT ORDER. THIRD THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND WE ARE PREPARED TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY IN A WAY THAT PROMOTES BOTH THE AGILE REGULATION THAT IS MUCH NEEDED IN THIS FAST EVOLVING SPACE. WHILE PROVIDING THIS BODY THE DATA AND THE INSIGHTS NEEDED FOR IT TO DO ITS JOB. AND SO LONG THOSE LINES WE'RE CERTAINLY PREPARED TO COME BEFORE YOU OFFER BUDGET HEARINGS ONLY. WE ARE HAPPY TO PRODUCE ANNUAL REPORTS- ADDITIONALLY- THE SENATE OF COURSE- HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONFIRM THE DEPARTMENT'S COMMISSIONER IT SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ASSEMBLY MAY WISH. MADE MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT AND WE OF COURSE REMAIN OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS THERE. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR THAT THERE ARE SOME CONSUMER FINANCIAL BUSINESSES. THAT HARM CONSUMERS AND WILL BENEFIT FROM NO REGULATION OR VERY LIGHT REGULATION. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THEY WOULD COME UNDER THE DEPARTMENTS UMBRELLA. AND SOME OF COURSE WILL REMAIN FOREVER OPPOSED BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO MONITOR THERE ARE REGULATED OR LIGHTLY REGULATED SPACE. LET ME NOW SPEAK TO SOME OF THE PROPOSAL AND THE ITEMS INCLUDED IN. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH GREATER COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND OUTREACH OMBUDSPERSON FUNCTION. AN INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY OFFICE FOCUSED ON EMERGING AND CHANGING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE TRAILER BILL OUTLINES HOW THE DEPARTMENT EXPANDED OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY WOULD FUNCTION. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT REGULATION IS FUNDAMENTALLY ROOTED IN LICENSING STATUS SO WHEN A CONSUMER TODAY HAS A COMPLAINT. THE FIRST QUESTION WE ASK IS WHETHER THE BUSINESS HAS A LICENSE FOR SHOULD HAVE A LICENSE. IF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL BUSINESS DOES NOT DOES NOT FALL SQUARELY WITHIN. THE PRESCRIPTIVE DEFINITION IN STATUTE. DDO DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OR ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER THAT ENTITY AND DPO CANNOT ACT REGARDING DECEPTIVE OR FRAUDULENT PRACTICES BY A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROVIDER THAT IS NOT LICENSED BY DVO. EVEN IF CONSUMERS ARE BEING HARMED. THE TRAILER BILL PROVIDES AUTHORITY FOR THE COMMISSIONER TO REQUIRE CURRENTLY UNLICENSED FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT. EXAMPLES OF CURRENTLY UNLICENSED- PRODUCTS MAY INCLUDE- DEBT COLLECTORS THAT RESOLUTION SERVICE PROVIDERS CREDIT REPAIR HE'S INCOME SHARE AGREEMENTS. THE NAME OF. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPERVISE THESE NEW COVERED PERSONS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH CONSUMER LAWS INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS AGAINST UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES. THE LAW WOULD ALSO AUTHORIZE THE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE YOU TAP. ALL THOSE UNDER THE DEPARTMENT'S PURVIEW. INCLUDING EXISTING LICENSEES. AND WHILE EXPANDING THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS AGAINST UNFAIR DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES THE SUBSTANTIVEYOU DAPPER PARLIAMENTS WOULD NOT CHANGE YOUR DATA IS CURRENTLY ROUTED IN FEDERAL LAW AS FOUNDED DODD FRANK. AND THIS PROPOSAL WOULD NOT CHANGE THAT. IN SUMMARY WE ENVISION CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS BEING PROTECTED BY A SENSIBLE BASELINE LEVEL OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THESE LAWS AND LEARN INFORMATION ABOUT CURRENTLY REGULATED INDUSTRIES ARE PROPS THROUGH THE REGISTRATION PROCESS. WITH THAT INFORMATION AND HANDS THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO CREATE OR HOW BEST TO STRUCTURE YOU LICENSING PROGRAMS. LET ME NOW SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE PROPOSAL STRIVE TO BALANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION WITH INNOVATION. THE GOAL OF THE INNOVATION PIECE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN INNOVATION. AND REGULATION SO THAT EMERGING IDEAS CAN BE VETTED AND REGULATORY HURDLES IDENTIFIED IN A COLLABORATIVE AGILE ENVIRONMENT. THIS WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO REAP% THE BENEFITS OF NEW PRODUCTS USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES WELL THE DEPARTMENT WORKS IN THE BACKGROUND TO HELP ENSURE THAT REMAIN SAFE FOR CONSUMERS. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US SO TIRELESSLY OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS. SINCE THE TRAILER BILL WHICH WAS MADE PUBLIC BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY. I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAMONT FOR HER INVALUABLE ADVICE AS WE CRAFTED AND REDRAFTED THE PROPOSAL. OVER THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS WE HAVE TAKEN A VARIETY OF AMENDMENTS ADDRESSING STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS. FROM WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY% GENERAL'S OFFICE TO WORKING WITH OF ADVOCATES AND INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE INCREASED CLARITY. WE HAVE AN OF COURSE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ALL TO MOVE FORWARD THE BEST POSSIBLE PROPOSAL. THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP UP AND PROTECT ITS CONSUMERS. CALIFORNIANS JOYS THE WORLD CLASS ECONOMY AND IT DESERVES A WORLD CLASS FINE. REGULATOR NOW AND AT ANY OTHER TIME. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF THIS COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. THIRTY WE'RE GOING TO GO NEXT TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE DREW SODERBERGH. AND ALEJO. THE REPORT OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR ASKING US TO SPEAK TODAY- IN REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL OVER OFFICE HAS IDENTIFIED A SERIES OF LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS IT EVALUATES THIS PROPOSAL. THEY PROBABLY FALL INTO TWO DIFFERENT BUCKETS. TO BEGIN WITH I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE POLICY ISSUES RAISED BY THE PROPOSAL. TO BEGIN WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO WANT TO CONSIDER HOW TO ENSURE THAT ITS PRIORITIES ARE REFLECTED IN WHATEVER TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION IS PASSED. AND TO ENSURE THAT IT'S ABLE TO PROPERLY EXERCISED OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT AS IT IMPLEMENTS ITS NEW RESPONSIBILITIES. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MANY KEY DETAILS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD NOT BE CODIFIED STATUTE. INSTEAD THEY BE LEFT TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS MEANING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO WORK OUT KEY DETAILS HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE OPTIONS TO ENSURE THAT ITS PRIORITIES ARE REFLECTED IN WHATEVER PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD. TO BEGIN WITH THE LEGISLATURE COULD MOVE UP SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING LOCKED THE REGULATORY PROCESS DIRECTLY INTO STATUTE. HOWEVER TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ARM. INTERESTED IN ALLOWING BE ADMINISTRATION TO PURSUE THESE THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE COULD STILL EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT WHATEVER REGULATIONS THE DEPARTMENT. THEY PLAYED. IT SUNSET ON THE AUTHORITY THAT IT GIVES THAT APART THIS WOULD IN THAT THERE IS A NATURAL CHICKEN POINT WHICH THE BUDGET COULD ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE REGULAR WHETHER THE THIRTY TO BE CHANGES AND IT THE THIRTY NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND INTO THE FUTURE. ALL IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER HOW TO BALANCE THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP A DETAILED PROPOSAL. WITH ITS DESIRE TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND ON A TIMELY BASIS. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT THE CODE. HAS TRUNCATED THE USUAL BUDGET AND POLICY PROCESS. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TAKING MORE TIME TO EVALUATE THE PROPOSAL AND TO WHERE YOU FEET PER COAT BUT WAIT A PROPOSAL. PARTICULARLY IF IT DECIDES TO MOVE. MORE OF THE PROPOSAL OUT FOR REGULATORY PROCESS DISPATCHER. IF THE LEGISLATURE ONCE MORE TRYING TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL IT COULD DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT. TO RICHARD THE PROPOSAL AND IT IN NEXT LARGEST SLEIGHT SESSION AND ON REFINING IT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE DELAYED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSAL SO THE LEGISLATORS GOING TO WANT TO WEIGH THIS AGAINST ITS DESIRE TO. PLACE GREATER. FOR CONSUMERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ON THE FINAL POLICY CONSIDERATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER CONSIDERING THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE STATE VERSUS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOUSING HEARD WHEN HE JUSTIFICATIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD FOR THE PROPOSAL IS THAT THE FRONT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. HAS STEPPED BACK FROM ITS TRADITIONAL- REGULATORY ROLE- WITH RESPECT TO MANY OF THESE ENTITIES HOWEVER IT'S POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS WILL TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH TO THE EXTENT THAT HAPPENS IT COULD RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALUE ADDED OF THE STATE'S ROLE IN THESE AREAS I'M NOT LIKE TO SPEAK TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT. ISSUE DID TO BE FOR THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSAL. TO BEGIN WITH THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO CAN SO THE OF. THAT IS PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT TO WHATEVER IS AGREED TO IN THE FINAL LEGISLATION NOT TO PROVE. THAT'S PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IN FINAL BUDGET DELIBERATIONS THE BUDGET PACKAGE IS SET ASIDE. FONG FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSAL AS IT EXISTED IN JANUARY. HOWEVER SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE JANUARY PROPOSAL MANY CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO IT. INCLUDING REMOVING OR LIMITING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER THERE HAS NOT BEEN PUT FORWARD A NEW ESTIMATE. OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSAL GIVEN THESE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO WANT TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER LEVEL FOR IT PROVIDES. IS CONSISTENT WHATEVER IT ULTIMATELY APPROVED. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER OF WAITING. ADDING TO FUTURE FUNDING INCREASES NOW DESPITE THE DEPARTMENT SPOTS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF THE FUTURE COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING THE PROPOSAL THERE ARE MANY UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY- FIRST THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES OF THE PROPOSAL. WOULD COVER NINE THOUSAND NEWLY COVERED PERSONS THAT OFFER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE PROPOSAL WILL REGULATE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW RELATED PRODUCTS AND- NUMBER OF NEARLY. BE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENT WHICH WOULD A MAJOR EFFECT ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING NECESSARY SECOND AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DELEGATES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ALL THE DETAILS TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS. WHATEVER REGULATIONS ARE ULTIMATELY ADOPTED WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING NECESSARY. AS SUCH THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER ONLY PROVIDING THE INITIAL FUNDING NECESSARY TO BEGIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS AND PERFORM OTHER INITIAL PROGRAM FUNCTIONS. FUNDING NECESSARY IN OUT YEARS COULD BE REQUESTED WHEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF WORK LOAD NECESSARY AND BY EXTENSION THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THAT WORKLOAD. FINALLY READ ENCOURAGED LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THE WAY THE PROPOSAL INTERACTS WITH OTHER PENDING LEGISLATION. IN PARTICULAR SB NINE OH EIGHT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY OVERLAP WITH THE PROPOSAL BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO LICENSE. THAT COLLECTORS. UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL MOST OF THE NEWLY COVERED PEOPLE WOULD BE DEBT COLLECTORS ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD ONLY BE REGULATED AS REGISTRANTS WHICH IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE. A LOWER LEVEL OF REGULATION THAT ENVISIONED UNDER S. B. BY NOW EIGHT IF THE LEGISLATURE PASSES SB NINE- IT MAY WISH TO FUND ALL OF THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATING THAT COLLECTORS. AS PART OF A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION COULD COULD PUT POURED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO IMPLEMENT IT IMPLEMENT SB NINE AWAIT AS IS TYPICALLY DONE FOR ME LEGISLATION. RATHER THAN PROVIDING THE REGULATED THAT FLATTERS. WE'RE I'M HAPPY TO HEAR ANY QUESTION. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO GO TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE KIMBERLY HARBISON. GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS ON KIMBERLY HARBISON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I HAVE SURELY MANNING WITH ME HERE AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO COMMISSIONER OF ROSES GRATITUDE FOR PRIDE PROVIDING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL WITH YOU TODAY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME AND FEEDBACK. AS THEY WORK WITH US TO REFINE THIS PROPOSAL OVER MANY MONTHS AND THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL YEAR. AS YOU KNOW THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT INCLUDES FUNDING IN A SET ASIDE ITEM THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVELS THAT WE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR CREDIT BCP. THIS IS. AN OVERALL TOTALS BUT IS NOT YET AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. IT IS CONTENT THE FINAL LEGISLATORS APPROVAL AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNATURE OF THE RELATED LANGUAGE. AS THE LEGISLATURE EVALUATES THIS PROPOSAL OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE WITH YOU. ON YOUR PROPERTY RESOURCE LEVELS NEEDED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THESE FUNCTIONS OVER THE COMING YEARS. THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS FOR FINANCE IN THE AGENDA. DO WE ANTICIPATE REQUESTING FUNDING THROUGH THE JAIL BECAUSE HE PROCESS BEFORE THIS LEGISLATION A SIGN. AND IS THIS A NORMAL PRACTICE. IN SHORT NO WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE REQUESTING FUNDING FOR THE JAIL BC PROCESS BEFORE THIS LEGISLATION ASSIGNED. IN ONE OF OUR WEEKLY CHECK IN CALLS WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF ON THIS ISSUE IN JULY WE TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THAT APPROACH. PLEASE REST ASSURED THIS IS NOT OUR NORMAL PRACTICE BUT THIS IS NOT A NORMAL YEAR. WHEN WE INITIALLY INTRODUCED THIS PROPOSAL IN JANUARY WE EXPECT THE TYPICAL SPRING PROCESS LIKE ANY OTHER YEAR. WITH COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. THIS DELIVERED A PROCESS USUALLY RESULTS IN SUCCESSFUL PROPOSALS BEING INCLUDED IN THE GYM BUDGET ACT. AND DEPARTMENTS BEING ABLE TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION ON JULY FIRST. GIVEN THE DESTRUCTION THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND CALENDAR. WE WERE BRAINSTORMING CREATIVE APPROACHES TO POTENTIALLY SINK THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PASSAGE OF THE BILL. OUR INTENT IN SUGGESTING THIS IS A POSSIBLE APPROACH WAS NOT TO BE PRESUMPTUOUS IN ANYWAY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PASS THIS BILL BUT THAT IF IT PASSED. TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO LAUNCH ITS ACTIVITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THIS YEAR. THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY PROPOSAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR COOPERATION IN PROVIDING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. TO THOSE CALIFORNIANS IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS. WERE VULNERABLE TO UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS AND THESE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES. WE HAVE TAKEN LEGISLATIVE AND STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND THINK THIS PROPOSAL ACHIEVES THE CONSUMER PROTECTION THE ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING. ON A RELATED NOTE WE POSTED THE CURRENT ITERATION OF THE LANGUAGE ON OUR WEBSITE LAST WEEK TO MAKE SURE IT WAS WIDELY AVAILABLE BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING. LATER TODAY AFTER THE HEARING. WILL REPLACE THAT FILE WITH WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL COMPLETED THIS WEEK. THERE ARE NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES BETEEN THE TWO DOCUMENTS. IN THE FILE WILL NOT INCORPORATE ANY CHANGES RESULTING FROM TODAY'S HEARING. ARE AND WE WILL BE POSTING IS SIMPLY THE CLEANED UP MORE FORMAL VERSION THAT THE PLEDGE OF LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TYPICALLY PROVIDES- THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME BACK TO THE- COMMITTEE- SEE WHO HAS WHAT MR OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR MISTER ALVAREZ. HEY IF WE COULD GET HIM BACK ON THE SCREEN. I THINK YOU HAVE TO ASK YOUR QUESTIONS AND THEN WHEN HE STARTS TALKING HE'LL COME BACK ON THE SCREEN ALL RIGHT SO- I I'VE I BELIEVE MR ADDRESS CAN YOU HEAR US. YES I CAN THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO MISTER ALVAREZ MY FIRST QUESTION IS- WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING HERE IS A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT STRUCTURE THAN THE LEGISLATURES ADOPTED ANOTHER COMMERCIAL SECTORS IN THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD. DECIDE THROUGH REGULATION AND WHAT CONSTITUTES AN UNFAIR DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICE RATHER THAN ON THE LEGISLATURE PUTTING THAT- THAT UNDERSTANDING IN STATUTE AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON WHY YOU THINK THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE GIVEN THAT THAT'S REALLY NOT THE WAY THAT WE DO IN OTHER COMMERCIALS. THANK YOU SO. ONE THING SAID- WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES- CONTEXT. THERE THERE IS A RECOGNITION WHEN TALKING ABOUT UNFAIR DECEPTIVE- ACTS AND PRACTICES. THERE'S A PRACTICAL RECOGNITION THAT IT IS DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AROUND EVERY SINGLE CORNER AND IDENTIFY WITH WITH PRESCRIPTIVE CLARITY. WHAT CRACK WHAT ACTION PRACTICES EXACTLY- WILL BE DEEMED OFF YEP CONSTITUTE DECEPTIVE OR UNFAIR PRACTICES SO THE CRITICAL POINT WHEN DEALING FINANCIAL SERVICES IT TO MAKE SURE. THE SENSIBLE GUN PROP THESE AND THAT THERE IN A TENSION TO THE EMPLOYER THAT IS- THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING FROM BOTH REGULATORS IN FOR FROM CONSUMERS SO. THE UPSHOT IS THAT UNFAIR DECEPTIVE PRACTICES CAN EVOLVE OVER TIME. AND THEY DEPEND ON THE GOVERNANCE PROCESS SEES THE COMPANY HAS IN PLACE INTERMIX OR THAT THEY ARE AVOIDING SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE ON DUTY HARMING THEIR THEIR CONSUMERS. OKAY THAT REALLY DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHY WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT FINANCIAL SERVICES THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN OTHER COMMERCIAL SECTORS- IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD A HEARING IN THE CONSUMER THE PRIVACY CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE THIS WEEK IN WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT UNFAIR DECEPTIVE PRACTICES IN USER INTERFACES FOR- DIGITAL ACCEPTANCE OF TRANSACTIONS AND- THAT'S IT EXTREMELY COMPLICATED TOPIC I JUST AS YOU SAID IT'S SOMETHING WHERE- WHERE WE HAVE THIS OF ALL THE INTERESTING OF WHAT CONSTITUTES UNFAIR DECEPTIVE. AND YET IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRYING TO PARSE IT AND TAKE INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY- FROM OUR CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCIES AND INDUSTRY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE FAIR BALANCED SO I THOUGHT I CAN WHAT WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT FINANCIAL SERVICES WORK WHERE A AN AGENCY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SHOULD BE HARD TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND- THAT OF THE LEGISLATURE. I CAN'T WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT SERVICES VIS A VIS A COMMERCIAL SECTORS I. THE FIRST IN THE INTRICACIES OTHERS. WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE NOTION OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION WITHIN CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES. IS NOT NEW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IS NOT YOU- AND IN OTHER CONTEXTS THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION HAS. IT'S UNFAIR DECEPTIVE STANDARD WHICH IS WHICH IT HAS APPLIED TO- TO VARISCAN OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR SOME TIME. THE CFPB OF COURSE- DOES SOMETHING SIMILAR- WHERE THEY STRIVE FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION AGAIN- AND I THINK. BUT THE WAS. PART OF WHAT THIS PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO GET. IS YEAH THERE'S IT OR ADD IT ALL WITHIN WITH THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL AND SPACE AGAIN WE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO REFINE- TO REFINED DEFINITIONS WITH TIME- BUT THERE IS PRECEDENT AGAIN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OF CREATING BASED LEVEL OF. SINGAPORE STANDARDS AND APPLYING THOSE AN AGILE FASHION BROKER WELL I THINK THAT A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD DISPUTE. THE ASSERTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T BE AGILE AND IN RESPONDING TO SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS. BUT LET ME MOVE ON TO MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS- THE FINANCES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS CREATING A LICENSURE. REQUIREMENT FOR A CERTAIN ENTITIES IN THE COMMERCIAL SPACE AND THEN IMPOSING A REGISTRATION FEE ON THOSE AGENCIES TO FIND AT THE OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN DONE AND OTHER COMMERCIAL SECTORS. CAN YOU TELL US. WHAT YOU THINK THAT REGISTRATION FEE MIGHT BE AND WHICH- WHICH ENTITIES WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR YOU THINK IT MIGHT APPLY TO. ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY ONE PIECE SO AGAIN THIS ISN'T. THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T CREATE ANY LICENSING REQUIREMENTS IT IS IT IS A REGISTRATION- REGIME- BUT YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE PROPOSAL CONTEMPLATES. REGISTRATION FEES WOULD BE IMPOSED ON ALL NEW COVER PERSONS- THE AMOUNT OF C. WORD TO PAY. ON SIZE OF COMPANY AND A PARTICULAR SECTOR BUT FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES IT DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE- FEES REGISTRATION FEES- CERTAINLY NOT IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS BUT MORE AND THE THREE TO FOUR DIGIT FRANK FIVE RANGE- BUT IT'S GOING TO DEPEND IT' GOING TO SCALE. ACCORDING TO- THE SIZE OF A PARTICULAR SECTOR- SIZE OF A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY- AND THE REASON ONE OF THE REASONS IN WHICH- THAT- THAT REGISTRATION FEE IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE WITH RESPECT- OUT REVENUE GENERATION. WE DON'T WANT THE PROPOSAL TO BE SINGULARLY DEPENDENT ON REVENUE GENERATED BY AT NOON FOR SOME ACTIVITY BECAUSE THAT OF COURSE CREATES- OTHER OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. RIGHT. SO WHAT WHAT'S THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU ANTICIPATE RAISING THROUGH REGISTRATION FEES. I AM HAPPY TO- COME BACK TO YOU ON WITH THE SPECIFICS OF HOW MUCH MONEY WE WOULD WE WOULD PROJECT RAISING IN A IN A GIVEN YEAR I JUST I DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL DETAILS AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AT THIS MOMENT. OKAY AND THEN LASTLY I WONDERED IF YOU COULD EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR TESTIMONY REGARDING. THE URGENCY OF GETTING THIS PASSED IMMEDIATELY. I YOU'D MENTIONED. THE NECESSITY OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS DURING THE PANDEMIC. WHEN THEY'RE MOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE WHICH IS SOMETHING I THINK EVERYONE IN THE CHAMBER CAN AGREE WITH- BUT- WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT OF COURSE AGAINST. THE NEED FOR US TO BE DELIVERED AND MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE BEING FAIR AND BALANCED AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT. MAKING WHAT'S GOING TO BE. EVENTUALLY A FAIRLY MAJOR CHANGE ON THIS PART OF- OF CALIFORNIA FINANCE SO COULD YOU TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. YEAH I'D BE HAPPY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK THROUGH PASSED- FINANCIAL CRISES AND- WHAT WHAT WE CAN OBSERVE IS THAT THERE IS THERE ARE COMMON PATTERNS WHENEVER WE GO THROUGH A FINANCIAL CRISES OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING- EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES AS THEY GO THROUGH VARIOUS CYCLES- WITHIN CONSUMER FINANCE WITHIN CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SO. FOR EXAMPLE AND WHAT WE I THINK ARE STARTING TO SEE WITH THE INCREASING COMPLAINTS. AS THE HOUSEHOLD BALANCE SHEETS STARTS TO EXPERIENCE A- A FREEZE ON THE GROWTH SIDE- THE STRUGGLE BECOMES WHERE THEN TO DEPLOY YOUR NEXT DOLLAR RIGHT WHICH DEBTS DO YOU APPLY THEM TO. AND CONCURRENTLY WITH. THERE IS TO BE OUR THEY ARE BAD ACTORS OUT IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT ARE LOOKING TO CAPITALIZE ON SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ANXIETIES AND FRUSTRATIONS OF CONSUMERS AND SO YOU START TO SEE- ANY NUMBER OF SCHEMES WHETHER IT BE THROUGH- INVESTMENT SCHEMES OR DEBT RELIEF SCHEMES OR CREDIT REPAIR SCHEMES. OR ANY NUMBER OF COMPANIES WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ECOSYSTEM ARE THEN VYING FOR THAT CONSUMERS LAST DOLLAR AND SO THE OBJECTIVE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE ABILITY TO STEP IN AND STOP HE- UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES OR REPRESENTATIONS THAT ARE MADE TO CONSUMERS AND THE MARKETPLACE SO THAT THEY ARE NOT UNDULY PARTED FROM- TOOK THEIR LAST DOLLARS ESSENTIALLY. OKAY YEAH I UNDERSTAND YEAH AND- I THINK WE ALL SHARE YOUR DESIRE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM THOSE DECEPTIVE PRACTICES I'M JUST STILL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE SHORT CALENDAR HERE UNDER WHICH RATE BEING ASKED TO DELIBERATE THIS VERY SUBSTANTIVE ACTION SO I CHECKED WITH MY QUESTIONS AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE GET BACK TO US ON- THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU. HAVE LIKE TO RAISE IN FEES THAT THAT'S JUST IT'S GONNA BE A CRITICAL ISSUE NOT JUST FOR OUR DELIBERATIONS BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF PROP TWENTY SIX AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT. WE DON'T COLLECT ANY MORE THAN THE COST OF REGULATING- SO- YOU KNOW THE IS YOU KNOW THERE'S A LONG HISTORY THERE OF I HAVE TO JUSTIFY. THE FEES THAT ARE COLLECTED AND HOW THE SPEAKER USE THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU WILL DO THANK YOU. MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MISTER KING OF OBVIOUSLY MISTER ALVAREZ- DEFERRED LIKE COMMENTS YOUR COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT OVERSIGHT THAT'S WITH THE BIG ISSUE TODAY'S JUST OVERSIGHT HEARING THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY POLICY. DEBATE ABOUT THIS AND NO PRECISE THAT'S WITH THE BIG ISSUE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE SEPARATE AND CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. AND WHAT I FIND INTERESTING AND IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO THIS. IS THE LANGUAGE THE CC. FPL EXPRESSLY GIVE THE D. F. PI THE POWER LIBERALLY CONSTRUE THE PROVISIONS. AND THAT CREATED SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN LIBERALLY CONSTRUED. THE TECHNICAL TERM. DOES THAT MEAN THAT D. F. P. LIKE IN YOUR ALLEY UNILATERALLY IN FOR LEGISLATIVE INTENT. I MEAN WE NEVER DO LAKE WAS LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF HIS LEFT TO. COULD BE A BIG DEAL WITH AND THAT'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT. SO THE WILL THAT LANGUAGE MEAN FOR US AS LEGISLATORS. I THINK THE CONCEPT THAT LOOKED UP THE PHRASE LITTLE LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION IS SEEKING TO CAPTURE IS AGAINST THIS THIS NOTION OF AGILE REGULATION THAT CAN- THAT CAN ADDRESS- FAST EVOLVING PRODUCTS SERVICES ON THE MARKET PLACE. THIS VARIOUS CONCEPTS IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WERE BORROWED FROM THE TWENTY TEN DODD FRANK ACT AND I CAN'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THIS THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION BUT I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF- IF THAT CONCEPT WERE WERE BORROWED FROM DODD FRANK ITSELF. BUT IT'S WIDE OPEN SO I MEAN IT'S OPENTO INTERPRETATION SO WHATEVER BUREAUCRAT- PERSON THE AGENCY THAT. IT CAN BE VERY CAN VARY WIDELY. AND THAT'S THE ISSUE WITH THE SPECIFIC IN LANGUAGE AND WE'VE SEEN WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES HAVE DONE. IF IT BASICALLY FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS DOWN WHATEVER THEY WANT AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW STUDIES HE'S RESPONDING TO LEGISLATORS REQUESTING COMMENT SO I MEAN WHY WOULD YOU INSERT LANGUAGE LIKE THAT. IS TO BE MORE SPECIFIC. AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK THE INTENT HERE IS TO IS TO RESERVE SOME ABILITY TO- TO SCALE AND TO- WORK IN AGILE FASHION TO MEET THE FAST EVOLVING- FINANCIAL SERVICES LANDSCAPE- THE LAST DECADE OF COURSE IN CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN- A RESURGENCE IN TREMENDOUS GROWTH WITHIN THE DIVERSITY AND THE TYPE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES- SO I WOULD JUST AGAIN ECHO- EARLIER COMMENTS WHICH IS- THAT'S THE VELOCITY OF CHANGE WITHIN FINANCIAL SERVICES OVER THE LAST DECADE HERE IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR HAS BEEN FAIRLY ASTOUNDING I CERTAINLY DON'T SEE. THAT CHANGING ANYTIME SOON LET ME MAKE ONE- LET ME JUST OBSERVE ONE OTHER POINT- A STRUCTURAL PIECE- YEAH AND A PART OF THE PROPOSAL- VERY THERE IS CONTEMPLATED A ROLE FOR AN OMBUDSPERSON WHOSE FUNCTION WOULD BE TO- LIAISE WITH WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT IF THERE EVER WERE- I'M CONCERNS ABOUT DECISIONS BEING MADE AT THE COMMISSION LEVEL OR ELSEWHERE THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT THERE WOULD BE. THAT INDEPENDENT CHANNEL FOR PEOPLE TO COMPLAIN TO AND- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A- YOU KNOW THE INTENTION THERE WAS TO CREATE A STRUCTURAL SOLUTION TO THE- TO THE OBSERVATION YOUR MAKING. GIVEN NINETEEN IN OUR ECONOMY. ASKING OUR STATE EMPLOYEES TO REDUCE THEIR SALARIES AND OTHER WORKLOAD AND FINANCIAL CHALLENGES FACING OTHER STATE AGENCIES SUCH AS D. SUCH AS EDT. IN THE DMV FAST FIASCO IS NOW THE TIME. TO STAND UP NEW DEPARTMENTS. NOW ALSO ALL OF THIS WE WILL ACTUALLY COMING UP IN NOVEMBER WE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT. PRESENT A NEW PRESIDENT WHO REESTABLISH THESE THESE PROTECTIONS. AND IF THIS LANGUAGE PASSES IT WILL TAKE EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR. SO LET ME CHANGE THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE. THANK YOU SO- YOUR YOUR FIRST POINT YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE CREATION NO THE NEW DEPARTMENT- AGAIN WE DON'T SEE THIS AS AS CREATING A NEW DEPARTMENT WE SEE IT AT REVAMPING OUR EXISTING AUTHORITIES OF GIVING- THE CURRENT DEPARTMENT. BETTER TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO BETTER PROTECT CONSUMERS AND- AND SO MY ANSWER TO THAT FIRST QUESTION IS YEAH. I WANT STOP YOU THERE ON THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING FOR. FORTY FOUR POSITIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN THE NINETY POSITIONS AT TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO IT'S NOT JUST THE CURRENT FOOTPRINT YOU'RE EXPANDING THAT FOOTPRINT ON THAT. SO HOW CAN YOU SAY IT'S NOT CREATED APARTMENT YOU'RE ADDING ADDITIONAL BODIES TO IT. AND WITH THAT FUNDING OBVIOUSLY GOING ON IS THERE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE FEES. ARE WE GONNA GENERAL FUND MONEY IS A SUFFICIENT MONIES IN THE SETTLEMENT ACCOUNTS. THE PROPOSAL NEEDED GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT SO JUST TO CLARIFY THE PROPOSAL CONTEMPLATES A TOTAL OF NINETY NEW POSITIONS OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT'S NOT NINETY INCREMENTAL AND YOUR THREE IT'S NINETY TOTAL NEW POSITIONS OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD WHICH REFLECTS 15% GROWTH OF THE CURRENT DEPARTMENT- THE OTHER POINT I THINK THAT IS THAT IS WORTH- AT NOTING IS THAT THE SALES REPORT ISSUED EARLIER THIS YEAR- OF THE QUESTION LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS WAS A NEW DEPARTMENT OR DEPARTMENTAL REORGANIZATION DELEO REPORT- NOTED THAT IT WAS IT WAS NOT. THE OTHER POINT THAT YOU MAKE ABOUT WHETHER- WHETHER GENERAL GENERAL FUND MONEY WHATEVER YOU NEED IT- IT WOULD NOT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE EVER NEEDED MEETING GENERAL FUND MONEY AND WE WOULD CERTAINLY STRUCK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT- THAT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I BUT- BE ABLE TO FOR OUR OWN WITH. WITH OUR OWN WITH OUR OWN REVENUES AS AS WE'VE DONE FOR FOUR YEARS NOW- IF I COULD GO BACK TO. ONE OF THE AND I APOLOGIZE YOU HAD ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT. WHETHER PRIORITIES REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CHANGE IF WE SAW- IF WE SAW A PARTICULAR OUTCOME IN IN NOVEMBER I WITH RESPECT TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND I BELIEVE YES THIS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE NEEDED IN ANY EVENT- BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIAN TORQUE AND TORQUE VALUES AND CRITICALLY- BECAUSE I THINK THAT- AMPLE COVERAGE IS ALWAYS- IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A CONCERN- AND- ONE IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS. WHEN THE TWENTY TEN DODD FRANK ACT WENT INTO EFFECT IN TWENTY ELEVEN. IT DEPUTIZED EVERY ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE COUNTRY AND- AND I BELIEVE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IT DEPUTIZE THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO USE THE TOOLS WITHIN DODD FRANK- AND TO AND TO INVESTIGATING CIVILLY PROSECUTE UNFAIR DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES WITHIN FINANCIAL- WITHIN FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THAT HAPPENED OVER A DECADE AGO AND SO I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD TEN YEARS LATER SAY. THAT WE'VE COMPLETELY STAMPED OUT THAT ACTS AND PRACTICES WITHIN FINANCIAL SERVICES EVEN THOUGH DAHLE DEPUTIZED LONG ALL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS STATES TO DO SO OVER A DECADE AGO. IT JUST GOES BACK TO HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE G. DMV CAR I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT IT ABOUT OVERSIGHT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED YOUR YOUR- INTRODUCTIONS THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS BILLS. TALK ABOUT IN JANUARY WELL WE WILL KILL IT WE REALLY HAVEN'T MET THAT MUCH IN TALK ABOUT COMMITTEE HEARINGS- MOST COMMITTEES WE OVER HOW TO COMMITTEE HEARINGS IN A REGULAR YEAR. THIS YEAR YOU KNOW MY COMMITTEES MET LIKE BELIEVE TWICE SO THE COMMITTEES. HAVE NOT MET THEY HAVEN'T THEY'RE NOT BUSINESS THAT SUBSTANTIAL DISCUSSION OF POLICIES SO JUST ACCESS TO PASS THE SMELL TEST. THAT IS BEING PUT TO THE TOP OF IT IS. WE ARE NUMBER ONE. OUR NUMBERS ARE THAT STATE AND THERE'S OTHER MORE IMPORTANT WE FOCUS CONSUMER REPORT. BUT I THINK IN NOVEMBER THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE. AND I JUST SAID IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN THAT. AND THAT'S WITH MY ISSUE THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR FONG. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A- JUST A FEW BROAD QUESTIONS- TO- TO JAVARIS- CERTAINLY- THE ECONOMY IS IN A IN A CERTAINLY DIFFICULT SITUATION AND- INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES NEED CAPITAL AND RESOURCES AS THEIR AND THIS AREA IS VERY COMPLEX- WOULD ADDRESS AND WITH UNDERSTAND CONSEQUENCES ANYTIME YOU TAKE ACTIONS- AS BROAD AS THAT- HAS THERE BEEN ANY. ANALYSIS OR NOT HAS BEEN DONE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CREATING THIS NEW RESTRUCTURING. ON THE SECTOR ON THE ON THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE'S BEEN NO BROAD- MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS LOOKING AT THE IMPACTS OF THIS OF THIS BUDGET ON ON THE ECONOMY IS THERE IS THERE ANY CONCERN YOU KNOW AS YOU AND POSE AS AS THE MEDICATION. THE IS CONSIDERING IMPOSING REGULATIONS AND FEET. A TIME WHERE A LOT OF A LOT OF. A LOT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE STRUGGLING IS THERE IS THERE CONCERN THERE. WELL WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THERE'S CERTAINLY THERE CERTAINLY INTERESTS AND- AND HAVING BETTER TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND DEEPER ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST WITH RESPECT TO REGULATION BUT FRANKLY- HOW FOR EXAMPLE CHANGING- CHANGING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HOW INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY ARE HAVING BROAD IMPACTS ACROSS THE ECONOMY SO- YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY- THERE IS- THERE CERTAINLY. TRISTAN NOT JUST THE IMPACT OF REGULATION THE IMPACT OF CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IMPACT OF IMPACT OF CHANGING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR- THEY'RE VERY MUCH INTEREST IN IN ALL. AND WHY IS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL MY PERSONAL VIEW ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ONE IMPORTANT ASPECTS IS- DEVELOPING SOME ABILITY AT THE STATE LEVEL TO. MONITOR IT AND TO DEVELOP THE TYPE OF INTELLIGENCE THAT THAT I THINK YOUR YOU'RE SEEKING. OKAY ON. YES I HAVE A CONCERN OF MINE IS. THE TIME WHEN WE NEED TO BE PUTTING MORE RESOURCES AND CAPITAL INTO THE ECONOMY THAT THAT THE ACTIONS TAKEN HERE COULD POSSIBLY CREATE A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S LESS CAPITAL AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING- THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING WAS FOCUS ON ON REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS- DOES. THE DEPARTMENT HAVE SPECIFIC GOALS IN MIND WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ACCOMPLISH GIVE ME GOAL WAS TO GO AFTER ON COVERED A PERSON JORDAN. OUR TO DO WHY ARE ALL FINANCIAL AND COVERED IN THIS PROPOSAL. I THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY I THINK THE ORIGINAL INTENSE- OF THE PROPOSAL AND THE INTENSE TODAY AND AS ALWAYS THERE- TO CREATE A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES SOME ELEMENT OF BRINGING AN- UNREGULATED MORE LIGHTLY REGULATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES- BY NOT TO THE EXCLUSION OF EXISTING LICENSEES AGAIN. THE PART OF THE OVER ARCHING OBJECTIVE. LEVEL PLAYING FIELD I THINK- AN OVER CORRECTION BY BY FOCUSING ONLY ON NEW COVERED PERSONS- WHILE IT WILL COMPLETELY CARVE OUT FROM THE PROPOSAL- INCUMBENT LICENSEES- IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE- MORE LEVEL PLAYING. OBJECTIVE AND IT MAY BE AND WORK THINGS THAT PHENOMENON NOW IF THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE. COME THE LICENSEES WE CONTINUE TO DO SO- TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS TAILORED TO THEIR SPECIFIC OF LICENSING REGION'S. I GUESS THAT'S THE BROADER CONCERN OF THAT- I KNOW THE MISTER OBERNOLTE CAN HIGHLIGHTED BUT WHEN YOU SAY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. IS THAT DEFINED BY THIS AGENCY OR IS THE U. ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE. TO AT LEAST. PROVIDE A YOU HAVE THAT AUTHORITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE- IT WHAT CONCERNS ME IS THAT. THE THIS AGENCY THAT IS- THAT'S NOT ELECTED- IT'S A NEW BUREAUCRACY THAT YOU GUYS ARE DEFINING WHAT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. AND ALAMEDA MARKET. TO FUNCTION IN ITS FOR CHRISTIANS. A COUPLE OF POINTS ON THAT I DON'T BELIEVE- IT IS. IT IS MY VIEW THAT THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T- ISN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WITH THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORTING- EVEN WITH THE PROPOSAL IN PLACE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO ASK ME LAWS CREATE NEW LICENSING REGIMES DEFINED CONTEXT SANDERS PROHIBIT FEATURES OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SO ON AND SO FORTH WHEN I REFER TO A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD SUPPOSE WHAT WHAT I MEAN IT IS A- UP. LOVE OF REGULATION AND I IN FRONT FRANKLY IS THIS IS AN OBSERVATION AND A COMMENT THAT- I HAVE HEARD MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF TIMES FROM OUR EXISTING LICENSEES WHICH IS- WE FRANKLY I WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR SOME SOLUTION THAT IMPOSES- SENSIBLE REGULATION AND EXPECTATIONS ON UNREGULATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE THE INCUMBENTS. BEAR A COST OF COMPLIANCE AND- AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE COMING INTO THE MARKETPLACE THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE- THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE SAME EXPECTATIONS AND SO I WOULD- YOU KNOW I TAKE YOUR POINT ABOUT ALLOWING THE MARKET FUNCTION. ON ITS OWN I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT I THINK ONE HAS TO QUESTION THE PREMISE OF WHETHER YOU HAVE AN EFFICIENT MARKET WHEN YOU HAVE. REGULATED INDUSTRIES ON THE ONE HAND AND THEN ON REGULATED INDUSTRIES- TRYING TO BUY THEIR WAY INTO THE MARKET PLACE- AND GRAB AND GRAB MARKET SHARE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK THAT'S THE CHALLENGE DUCKING ABOUT THE MADE WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE CELL SIGNIFICANT HERE IN. THE ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED HERE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO THIS AND I CAN MAKE SOME. TIME UP. CERTAINLY IT I THINK IT HERE'S RECKONS FOR ALL LOT OF MEMBERS. AND I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION IS MADE CERTAINLY A LOT OF BROADER TORTILLAS BEING PROVIDED A PROPOSED IN IN ADD TO THIS. TO THIS NEW OF RESTRUCTURING. IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT. THAT AT. THAT IF THIS PROPOSAL GRANTS. THAT THEY'RE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- THAT PRODUCTS THAT ARE LEGAL TODAY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ARE LEGAL TODAY WOULD BE OR COULD BE DEEMED ILLEGAL IN THE FUTURE BY THE FBI. I DON'T. IT IS MY VIEW THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT- PRODUCTS THAT REGULATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALREADY EXIST IN THE MARKETPLACE TODAY- IT IS NOT MY VIEW THAT THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES- CURRENTLY REGULATED WHAT RETROSPECTIVELY BE DEEMED ILLEGAL TOMORROW. SO USING THE ARE EXPECTED TO BUY IN AND THAT'S IT LET'S SAY AT THE USING- ARE USING THESE OBERNOLTE EXAMPLE THAT- YOU. DO YOU IN IT DID NOT YOU BUT THE AT THE AGENCY- CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF A OF A PRODUCT AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT PRODUCT IS NO LONGER. ALLOWED TO BE- SOLD IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT POSSIBLE. I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE AND THAT'S NOT MY EXPECTATION. OKAY I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THE ANSWER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS BURKE. M. SO I HAVE BEEN LISTENING I HAVE A COUPLE I WANT TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES WITHIN THE SENATE ABOUT- HOW THIS IS BEING DONE QUITE FRANKLY THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T EVEN AGREE WHETHER IT'S AN EXPANSION OR NEW DEPARTMENT IS REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY CONCERNING. HOWEVER I ALSO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ABILITY TO BE AGILE AND THE FACT THAT YES DIFFERENT PRODUCTS COME UP QUICKLY WE EXPERIENCE THAT AN ACROSS THE BOARD NOT JUST IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND THE ONE THING THAT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME IS THE FACT THAT IN A NORMAL DEBATE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY I HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT. THAT MR OVER. NUMBER OR AT SOME MEMBER BILL. AND I THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND MY CONSTITUENTS AND WHAT THEY MAY NEED AND I'M- CURIOUS THIS OMBUDSPERSON OR THIS DEPARTMENT. I AM I'M WONDERING FIRST OF ALL. MY IMPRESSION IS THERE IS ALREADY AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. AND CONSUMER PROTECTION THE EIGHTEEN. THE TV ALREADY HAS CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT. I'M WONDERING. HEY WHY WE NEED ANOTHER LAYER OF ENFORCEMENT AND BE HOW DO WE HAVE THAT PROPER CONVERSATION AND NOT PROPER TO BE WHERE. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS SOMETIMES THE PRODUCT. MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. COMMUNITIES WOULDN'T NEED HOW DO THEY GET THEIR VOICE INTO THIS CONVERSATION IS NOT ON THE TENTH PERSON HAVE ACTUALLY SOME pTHE DEPARTMENT HAVE DIFFERENCE TO US EIGHT IF WE DON'T EVEN FUND THEM. AND HE WANTS ME TO GIVE AWAY SO MUCH ABOUT A FORTY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GOING TO YEARS YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT AND I APOLOGIZE I WOULD YOU MIND RESTATING THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION. REMEMBER I THINK THE FIRST PART OF MY QUESTION WENT WITH FIRST PART OF A STATEMENT ONCE IT'S CONCERNING TO ME THAT WE WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION WHEN WE CAN'T EVEN ALL AGREE. OUR NEXT. HOW DO WE HAVE A BALANCED CONVERSATION WHEN THE LEGISLATURE WHO IS. ELECTED TO. TO REPRESENT DIFFERENT DIVERSE COMMUNITIES HOW IS THAT COMMUNICATED WITH THIS DEPARTMENT AND WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THIS DEPARTMENT HAVE. IF IN FACT WE DON'T EVEN CONTROL THEIR BUDGET. I MEAN IT IS ALL RIGHT IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET WHERE WE CAN SAY-OKAY. I'M DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES YOU ARE NOT PERFORMING. WE HAVE EXERCISED AUTHORITY OVER YOU EVEN AT A BUDGETARY LEVEL OR ON. WHAT ANY OTHER DEPARTMENT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT ACTUALLY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER BROUGHT UP OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN WHICH- WE ARE GDP WERE WORTH HAVING ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOW HOW WHERE ARE THE CHECKS AND BALANCES BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS NEW DEPARTMENT OR EXPANDED DEPARTMENT. AND DOES THAT COME TO THIS ON THE FIRST. TO EXPLAIN. YEAH IT FOR A SITTING. I THINK. ONE OF THE SO AGAIN I WOULD I WOULD REITERATE- MY COMMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT'S COMMITMENT TO WORK- HAND IN HAND WITH THE LEGISLATURE AROUND. SENSIBLE GUARDRAILS- AGAIN I DON'T VIEW I DON'T VIEW AS BEING ACTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THE FUNCTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE BY THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND- THE LEGISLATURE IS FUTURE WORK. YOU YOU ASK- I THINK YOU'RE ASKING VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE- THE UNIQUE MEETS THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF MEMBERS WITHIN WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITIES WITHIN YOUR DISTRICTS- AND- YOU KNOW I'LL BE LIMIT LET ME. UNPACK THAT THIS WAY. I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT- THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST DECADE AND- THE INFLUENCE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION WITHIN FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. I THINK ONE OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS HAS BEEN THE ABILITY TO DELIVER- QUALITY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES I BELIEVE THAT VERY DEEPLY AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A FULL VERSION OF THAT. THAT IS WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE SOME OF THE- ASPECTS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE THOSE MARKET MONITOR FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE ENHANCE CONSUMER. OR WE WOULD HAVE FOR AND OFFICE FOCUSED ON- ON SERVICE MEMBERS OR STUDENTS OR NEW AMERICANS WORK OTHER- HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- I THINK THE OBJECTIVE IS TO BE DATA DRIVEN TO LISTEN TO- THEIR THEIR PARTICULAR CONCERNS AND EXPERIENCES WITH FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SO THAT WE CAN AGAIN HELP DRIVE. BOTH SMARTER REGULATION BUT AS WELL AS- BECOME A BETTER PARTNER ON ON IN POLICY CONVERSATIONS RELATED TO THOSE THOSE CONSTITUENTS. AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK YOU AND IT'S NICE TO HEAR BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT'S NOT YOU. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT'S WHEN IF THERE IS A DIFFERENT LEADER WHO PUTS A DIFFERENT PERSON IN YOUR PLANE AND THEN. MY COMMUNITY HAS WHERE DOES MY COMMUNITIES WAYS COME INTO THE CONVERSATION IF AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IF THIS. DEPARTMENT OR EXPANSION OCCURS. AGAIN I THINK THE STRUCTURAL WE WOULD LIKE TO- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THOSE STRUCTURAL CHANNELS- GET BUILT AND STAY IN PLACE AS PART OF AS PART OF THE FUTURE DEPART AND I THINK REALLY THIS LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE FUTURE DEPARTMENT OUGHT TO OUGHT TO HAVE THAT MECHANISM TO WORK HAND IN HAND- AND HAVE AND HAVE A SENSIBLE CHECK INS IN MY LAST COMMENT IF IT THROUGH THE TEARS. ONE LAST COMMENT- AND THAT WOULD BE GREAT THE HARD THING IS AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT A LOT OF US ON ON THE SIDE ARE FACING IS THAT WE HAVE STRUGGLE TO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH INSPIRATION I THINK THAT REALLY THIS STRUGGLE HERE IS THAT WE'VE I DON'T THAT FOR LIKE ON SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITY OPERA. WE'VE HAD TO MISERY THE. NEXT THING HAS BEEN A WAY TO. AND I AND- IF IT DOESN'T. TO DO GREAT BUT I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE A THE FRONT END NOT ON THE- AND A BLOOD. I E WOULD HAVE TO SEE IF IT PROCESS. THANK YOU THOUGH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TIME AND ANSWERS. THANK THANK YOU MR STYLE. THANK YOU COMMISSION I GUESS I WAS SCRATCHING MY HEAD WHEN. LEGISLATIVE TALK ABOUT GIVING UP WITH FORTY BECAUSE YOUR DEPARTMENT YOUR AGE THE ONLY EXISTS UNDER THE AUTHORITY. OF THE STATUTES THAT WE CREATE AND- THAT NEVER CHANGES BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE REGULATING UNDER THIS STATUTORY AUTHORITY SO MY QUESTION IS. WE'RE STEPPING INTO TERRITORY WHERE THAT OF FORTY. MAY NEED TO CHANGE OVER TIME BASED ON WHAT YOUR FINDING. N. THE I OUT IN THE FIELD THAT AND I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES IT'S LONG PAST TIME THAT CALIFORNIA HAVE A FUNCTION LIKE THIS SO HOW HOW CAN YOU BETTER WORK WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GIVEN YOU THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY WHICH I THINK AT THIS POINT. I'M PERFECTLY FINE WITH. BUT THAT OVER TIME. WE'RE ABLE TO COME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR SEEING ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE THEN CAN MODIFY THAT OF FORTY AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PROVIDING THAT% FUNCTION. TO ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES APPROPRIATELY ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- LET LET ME START BY- JUST HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE- SOME SOME OF THE- SOLUTIONS- TO THE QUESTION YOU'VE YOU'VE ASKED WE OF COURSE WOULD COMMIT TO. PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE AN ANNUAL REPORT ON OUR ON OUR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES- RULEMAKING ACTIVITIES- AS WELL AS OUR OUR DEEPER ENGAGEMENT WITH- WITH COMMUNITIES- AND WITH- AND WITH NEW MARKETS-IT IS- AGAIN IT'S MY HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT WE CAN- DEVELOP THAT SORT OF MUSCLE THAT THAT. INCREASE AND NOT IN HIT ITS- SPIRIT C. AND FLOATING BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IN THE MARKETPLACE WHAT WE CAN THAT PROVIDE TO OUR TO OUR- TO OUR PARTNERS AND TO ENTER THE LEGISLATURE- THERE IS THERE THERE WILL OF COURSE REMAIN- THE- THAT THE CRITICAL BUDGET OVERSIGHT THAT YOU ALL- THE YOU ALL EXERCISE- AND- WE- REMAIN. WE REMAIN COMMITTED AND I THINK WE HAVE WE HAVE AN OPEN MIND TO HEARING- OTHER OTHER THOUGHTS AND OLUTIONS- THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE ABOUT HOW HOW TO BETTER- PARTNER TOGETHER. THANK MISTER DOCTOR REGULAR. THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO START COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ BY ROAD MAPPING WHERE I'M GOING TO BE ASKING QUESTIONS AND THEY WILL BE UNDER THE STAFF COMMENTS NUMBER SEVEN AND THEN NUMBER THREE. BUT WITH PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO. READ TO START AND ALSO TO THANK CHAIRWOMAN. LEADERSHIP IS NOT ABOUT BEING IN CHARGE LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT TAKING CARE OF THOSE IN YOUR CHARGE. THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU BROUGHT BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE LAST YEAR SHOWED REAL LEADERSHIP TO TAKE CARE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO START BY THANKING YOU. FOR STARTING US DOWN THIS PATH. WHAT I BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL IS BEING PRESENTED TO US TODAY. IS TO HELP CALIFORNIA CREATE A BASELINE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION STANDARDS. SO THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT OCCURS IN NOVEMBER ELECTION WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW LEADERSHIP AND TO PROTECT OUR CONSUMERS AND CHARLAMAGNE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU RECEIVE THAT APPROPRIATE RECOGNITION FOR THAT. NOW FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. I'D REALLY LIKE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND. TRANSITIONS BECAUSE I SEE WHERE IT IS YOU'RE TRYING TO GET US TO. BUT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR YEARS ONE TWO AND THREE AS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN AGILE FRAMEWORK. AND YOU ARE TELLING US WE CAN REFINE THIS WITH TIME WATER YOUR- EXPECTATIONS THAT WILL OCCUR IN THESE FIRST FEW YEARS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT OUR OUR TRANSITIONAL ROADMAP- HERE'S WHAT WE- HAVE DISCUSSED AND CONTEMPLATED AT A AT A HIGH LEVEL. YEAR ONE WOULD BE FOCUSED ON HIRING KEY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND STARTING TO SCALE UP SOME OF THE CRITICAL FUNCTIONS SO. THAT WOULD INCLUDE OF COURSE- IDENTIFYING RECRUITING AND RETAINING. SOME OF THE KEY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS INCLUDING THE- THE DEPUTY OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION DIVISION AS WELL AS- THE PERSON THAT WOULD LEAD THE OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION- BUILD OUT WORK WITH. NEW LEADERSHIP TO BUILD OUT EACH OF THOSE NEW FUNCTIONS. START TO LEVERAGE THE MARKET MONITORING AND ENHANCED CONSUMER- RESEARCH AND INSIGHTS FUNCTIONS TO GET OUR HANDS AROUND THE NEW COVERED PERSONS AND NEW TERRITORY- THE FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION OFFICE WOULD ALSO BE ENGAGING WITH. THOSE NEW INDUSTRIES AND ENTREPRENEURS- TO START LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A LONG TERM STATE WORKING RELATIONSHIP- AND THE TARGETED CONSUMER OUTREACH OFFICE WOULD START TO DEVELOP- TOOLS COMMUNICATION TOOLS WEB TOOLS. AND OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED TO EDUCATE AND EMPOWER CONSUMERS TO MAKE BETTER INFORMED FINANCIAL DECISIONS- YEAR TWO WE WOULD START TO START DOWN THE PATH OF LOOKING AT- AREAS RIGHT FOR REGULATION- THE EDUCATION OFFICE WOULD REACH OUT TO YOU CALIFORNIANS SENIORS AND STUDENTS THROUGH VARIOUS- EDUCATION EFFORTS. WE WOULD CONTINUE HIRING OBVIOUSLY NEW POSITIONS INTO THAT SECOND YEAR AND BUILDING UP- PUTTING MORE MORE FLESH ON THE BONE AS IT WERE WITH RESPECT TO- SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS. AND WE WOULD WE WOULD EXPECT I WOULD EXPECT TO START USING AN EXAMINING SOME OF THE NEW PERSONS- TO ENSURE I GET COMPLIANCE WITH THE BASELINE LEVEL OF EXPECTATIONS- AND SO THAT WE CAN START TO THE DEVELOP SOME OF THE SOME MUCH NEED. MARKET DATA TO REPORT BACK TO UP TO CRITICAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE- AND OF COURSE WE WOULD- WE WOULD WORK ON DEVELOPING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS. YOUR THREE HOUR FINALIZING REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE REGISTRATION FRAMEWORK. YOUR THREE WOULD BE THE THIRD WAVE OF HIRING SO- HIRING AT FULL CAPACITY- AND WE WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE ALL RESOURCES ON BOARD BY THREE. I KEPT. YEAH HIGH LEVEL OF RECESSION YOUR ONE IS ABOUT- HIRING LEADERSHIP AND GETTING OUR ARMS AROUND- AROUND IN YOUR TERRITORY YOUR TWO IS ABOUT STARTING TO. IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE NEW TOOLS AND GOING INTO THE NEW TERRITORY AND DEVELOP LEARNING IN YEAR THREE AS ABOUT. ROUNDING OUT THE- THE PROPOSAL AND- INTEGRATING IT INTO AND INTO THE DEPARTMENT BRIT BRIT MARCH. LET ME START BY- OPINING THAT- I BELIEVE YOU'VE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS TODAY FOR THE NEED FOR INCREASED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR TWO BRANCHES AND- HOW THAT WILL HELP US TO. MORE EFFECTIVELY COLLABORATE IN THE FUTURE BUT I WANT TO FOCUS ON YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR TO IN WHICH OF REGULATIONS WILL BE PROMULGATED. SO HOW WILL THE DEPARTMENT ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS UNDER THIS LAW BEFORE THE REGULATIONS ARE PROMULGATED AND- WILL THEY BE RETROACTIVE. THANK YOU SO V. ON ON DAY ONE THE DEPARTMENT% WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE- PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ON UNFAIR DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES SO THERE WOULD BE THE AUTHORITY ON DAY ONE TWO- YOU CAN LOOK AT CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AND COMMENCE. INVESTIGATIONS AS TO AS TO THOSE BAD AXE PRACTICES- THAT WOULD NOT BE- THAT WOULD NOT BE RETROACTIVE AS AS AS DRAFTED IT WOULD IT WOULD NOT. BE LOOKING BACK WE WOULD BE LOOKING FORWARD OF COURSE THAT- AT BAD AXE- THAT. THEY COME UP ON A LEADERSHIP. I WAS MOVED BY YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE VELOCITY OF CHANGE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO I WILL JUST AGAIN AND BY ENCOURAGING AS MUCH COMMUNICATION AS WE CAN BETWEEN OUR BRANCHES- AND I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK TOWARDS THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR- CHAIR HERE AND- BANKING AND FINANCE TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE END UP AT THE TOP THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA NEXT WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BARRICADE HAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AB I WANT TO ECHO I WANT TO START BY ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- INCREDIBLE WORK CARRYING ON ON THIS. EFFORT I THINK WE HAVE SEEN THOSE OF US TO SIT ON YOUR COMMITTEE THE PAST YEAR LAST- AND YOUR DESIRE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS AT ALL TURNS. AND AS WE SIXTEEN IN LAST DECADE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER MARKETS MOVE FASTER THAN- SOMETIMES WE CAN RESPOND AND I THINK YOUR FORWARD LOOKING THOUGHT AROUND THAT AND HOW WE CAN CREATE AN AGILE. AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WAS. BRILLIANT AND- YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR LEADERSHIP IS PLAYING OUT IN THIS PROPOSAL SO THANK YOU. AM I HAVE. YOU KNOW I CONSUMER PROTECTIONS SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT AND THE PRIORITY OF EVERYTHING WE DO AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS BEFORE US TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR MOVING THAT FORWARD- BUT I. I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES REGARDING. SORT OF FUTURE LOOKING- CONCERNS AROUND OVERSIGHT AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE LAST YEAR WHEN. WE WERE CONTEMPLATING CHAIRWOMAN'S INCREDIBLE BILL THAT LOOKED AT PREDATORY LENDING THE CONVERSATION IS ROBUST AROUND. SORT OF FOCUSING ON THE FACT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT ALSO ROBUST MARKETS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BORROW IS CRITICAL. AND SO HOW DO WE BALANCE SORT OF TAKING THOSE PREDATORY PRACTICES AWAY WHILE ENSURING PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO BORROWING. AND MY CONCERN REMAINS THE SAME HERE WHICH IS ALTHOUGH IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS PERSON GO AFTER UNFAIR PRACTICES WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE MARKETING SURE WE'RE PROTECTING ACCESS TO CAPITAL BEING TIME. AND SO LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IS CRITICAL IN MAKING SURE WE RETAIN THAT BALANCE. AND SO I WANT TO JUST BRING A QUESTION BACK TO THING THAT CAME UP DURING A FAMILY OR BURKE. HI WHICH IS THE BY. WHICH IS OF OUR MAIN SOURCES OF OVERSIGHT FOR THE AGENCY'S AS WAS MENTIONED AND I THINK WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE SEEN THAT WHERE WE GIVE FUNDING WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT IT- NOT THAT'LL BRING UP HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE- THAT WE THEN LOSE THE ABILITY. TO REVISIT AND HAVE OVERSIGHT IN THOSE. INSTANCES AND SO I GUESS WHICH SHE MENTIONED I WANT A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARIFICATION OF HIS ONCE WE APPROVE THIS EXPENDITURE. WE CAN'T LOOK BACK AS WE DO WITH OTHER AGENCIES IS THAT RIGHT THE YOUR- YOUR FUNDING IS ONGOING AND IS NOT REVISIT IN FUTURE BUDGET. I GUESS DEPARTMENT FINANCED IN RESPONSE THAT IF THEY FEEL LIKE THE MORE APPROPRIATE. HI KIMBERLY ABSENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES WE'VE BUILT THIS IN AS ONGOING FUNDING RAMPING UP OVER THREE YEARS AS THE COMMISSIONER NOTED. OKAY WHEN I WOULD URGE US TO REVISIT THAT QUESTION AND MAYBE THAT'S WHERE OVERSIGHT WILL COME IN- BECAUSE I DO THINK WE NEED TO LOOK. LONG AND HARD AT HOW WE CONTINUE TO EXERCISE OUR AUTHORITY AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT THAT. THANK YOU OUT OF HERE. THANK YOU SOME AIRBAGS. MCCARTY. ARE THEY ON OUR OKAY- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS AND THEN- DEBATE ABOUT THE POLICY AND FIRST I'M I'M NOT ON THE BANKING COMMITTEE I'M NOT A SUB FOR THIS IS THE OVERSIGHT HEARING OF SUBJECTS OF SOMEWHAT NEW TO THIS POLICY AREA BUT- ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE VERY INTEREST IN FINANCIAL SERVICES THIS IS A BIG ISSUE WE'VE HEARD FROM. I STAKEHOLDERS. BUT BUT THE ISSUE I JUST WANTED TO SAY ABOUT BEING AT RUSHED THROUGH I THINK THAT- A LITTLE BIT SHALLOW. FOR REASONS WE HAD SOME BUDGET TRAILER BILLS THAT LITERALLY WERE PROPOSED. A COUPLE NIGHTS BEFORE THEY WERE IN FRANCE AND WE SAW THAT ABOUT A MONTH AGO. WHERE THEY WEREN'T IN THE JANUARY BUDGET THEY WEREN'T IN THEM MAY REVISE THEY WERE. CAME TO LIGHT SOME OF THE IDEAS JUST SEVENTY TWO HOURS BEFORE THE PROPOSED BE VOTED ON THIS FLOOR SO THAT I THINK IS VERY PROBLEMATIC AND I OBJECTED TO THAT. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT WAS SUBMITTED IN THE MAY REVISE OUR BEFORE THAT IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN USE THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS DIDN'T HAVE AMPLE TIME FOR- I'VE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND FOR VETTING GRANTED WE DIDN'T HAVE THEIR VETTING THIS YEAR WE HAD AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE YEARS BUT TO SAY THAT IT'S- SPRUNG UPON US AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR I THINK- IS NOT QUITE ACCURATE SAYS. FOR THE RECORD I WANT TO SAY THAT- YOU KNOW OVERALL- IN THIS. COLD ED WORLD WE SEE A REALITY THAT. THAT PEOPLE OF AND- YOU KNOW HOW ECONOMIC STRESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES SOURCES ARE GETTING HAMMERED AND WE SEE THAT LEFT AND RIGHT. AND JUST FOR THE PURE ECONOMICS OF JOB WAS THERE THERE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THERE LIFE SAVE THAT ON BUT THERE ARE. ANAND RESOURCES AND SOMETIMES ON PEAK BEING IMPACTED IT IS COMPOUNDED UPON THAT AND SELL- CONSUMER PROTECTION IS A KEY THING I THINK WE ALL AGREE UPON THAT THINK LAST IS THAT THE BALLOT. PROTECTING OUR CONSUMERS AND SO. TAKING A STEP BACK AND I'M NOT IN THE WEEDS LIKE CHER LIMóN WHO HAS DONE A GREAT JOB IN THIS FIELD FOR LAST COUPLE YEARS PROTECTING CONSUMERS BUT- YOU KNOW MIKE FORTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL TO SOMEONE WHOSE. YOU KNOW. SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO MY COMMUNITY DURING THE LAST RECESSION WHEN I WAS THE LOCAL FISH ON THE CITY COUNCIL ON. THE HOUSING CRISIS AND HOW YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. IT KNOWING THAT MORE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IF IT'S NOT GONNA pIS A GOOD THING. AND I'M JUST KIND OF AT A LOSS AS FAR AS HOW THIS WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACTS. AND THROW. YOU KNOW THANK YOU RENTS IN IN. IN THE INDUSTRY THAT IT WHAT'S IT WHAT HARM THEM FROM DOING THEIR BUSINESS I MEAN IS IT MORE PAPERWORK IN OVERSIGHT OR IS IT REALLY GOING TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. FOR COOPER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THIS FINANCIAL MESS INDUSTRY ITSELF. I KNOW WE WILL HAVE NEXT- A SERIES OF COMMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENTS I THINK WITH. YOU KNOW STRONG. BUT IN THE END I I'M COM. THAT THE COMMISSIONER. COMMISSIONER AL. AND EVEN THE L. A. L. HAS HEARD THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL. AND I WOULD LIKE- FOR THEM AT THIS POINT. TO YOU KNOW BASICALLY- RESPOND AS FAR AS- HOW YOU THINK THAT THESE REGULATIONS. WILL NOT BE OVER BURDENS THEM TO THE FINANCE MINISTRY IN CALIFORNIA AND- AS OPPOSED. TO THE FOR THE IDEA TO PUT FORTH IS PROVIDING MORE. CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA RELATED TO THEIR BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. HOPE YOU GOT THAT QUESTION SORRY FOR THE ROUNDABOUT WAY ASKING IT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- WHEN I YOU KNOW IN IN MY MIND I FRAME I THINK OF ENHANCE REGULATION NOT NECESSARILYIS- MORE BURDEN CENTER OR MORE VOLUMINOUS BUT I THINK OF IT AS- SMARTER REGULATION AND- SPEAKING YOU KNOW REPLYING IN. A BIT ON MY PAST EXPERIENCE WITHIN. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE ABOUT TO NAVIGATE. FINANCIAL LOSS OR IT IS MY IT IS MY SINCERE BELIEF AND I DON'T THINK I'M ALONE AND IN SAYING THIS BUT IT IS MY SINCERE BELIEF THAT. THAT CLEARER SMARTER REGULATION- IS NOT AT ALL BURDEN ON BUT IS ACTUALLY A BOON TO INDUSTRY WHAT WHAT OPERATORS MOST OFTEN EXPECTATIONS AND AGAIN THAT IS. PART OF WHAT- WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS PROPOSAL BY- BY IMPOSED- BUT TRYING TO ACHIEVE A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. THE WHOLE TATIAN. I THINK THAT'S THE IT'S OFTEN BENEFICIAL TO CONSUME BUT ALSO THAT A LOT OF IN CLEAR THAT THAT BRINGS TO THE MORE IS A THAT TO COMPETE SO ALSO AGAIN I'M SOMEONE THAT WILL BE THAT THE TWO THE TO OF PROTECTION AT EIGHT. ARMY CHU EXCLUSIVE THEY THEY NEEDED TO BE FACTORS BELIEVE THAT THE AND BECAUSE- UNDER THAT THERE ARE FEW GROWTH ACROSS. D. PLEASE S. ON CONSERVE PRINCE BECAUSE MAKE SENSE IT MAY A GOOD. SENSE TO DEVELOP A LONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AS OPPOSED TO TIME TRANSACTION AND- VOEPEL LAST THING I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT IS. WE AGAIN WE SEE WE SEE TO ACHIEVE A LEVEL OF SMARTER BYE BYE DEVELOPING FROM OF FRANKLY WE JUST DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE- AT AT THE STATE AT THE STATE REGULAR LEVEL NAME. MARKETMILE WHERE WE ARE MORE PRICE READ OUT AND KEEP OUR FINGERS THE PULSE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY CHANGING AND THE MARK. I THINK TO DATE WE ARE WE TEND TO BE A UP MORE ON THE RECEIVING END THAT THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND- AGAIN I EIGHT IT IS HARD FOR ME TO SPEAKTO WHAT MAKES FINANCIAL SERVICES SO TO SOME DIFFERENT FROM OTHER COMMERCIAL AREAS BECAUSE I'M NOT I'M NOT EXPERT AND OTHER COMMERCIAL AREAS- BUT I CAN- VERY MUCH STATE AGAIN. HOW TO CLEAR THAT THE LAST DECADE HAS SEEN TREMENDOUS- TREMENDOUS GROWTH AND CHANGE RIGHT- AND CHANGE WITHIN FINANCIAL SERVICES- ONE. I OFTEN PEOPLE IS. UP WHEN IS LAST TIME YOU WALKED IN A BRICK MORTAR LOCATION TO DEPOSITOR WITHDRAW MONEY CHANCES ARE THAT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT AS AS OFTEN OR AS AS AS RECENTLY AS YOU'VE USED. SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO MOVE MONEY- SO I THINK THERE IS- I THINK THAT THERE'S A VERY REAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT- BUT THE VELOCITY CHANGE FINANCE SERVICES HAS DEBT FOR THE- WHETHER GOOD OR BAD- IT IS IT IS REAL. AND I THINK IT'S GONNA PROCESS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THANK YOU. FIGURES MCCARTY I WAS GOING TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND TURNED OVER TO CHARLIE MON- MID ROBERTS KEEP CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE THAT YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR RESUME A LITTLE BIT BUT HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU WORKED IN THE- FINANCIAL SECTOR. IT WAS. GOING ON JUST UNDER ATTACK I SPENT JUST UNDER TWO YEARS AS AN ENFORCEMENT TRAINING WITH THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS SPENT THREE YEARS AS WHEN IT BEFORE SPENT TRAINEES WITH THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU- AND THEY SPEND ROUGHLY FIVE YEARS AS AS A GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE- L. G. COMPANY WHERE WE- YEAH I. I HELPED THE COMPANY GROW FROM ROUGHLY THIRTY EMPLOYEES TO- JUST JUST UNDER SEVEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU FIFTEEN MINUTES SEEMS LIKE BASED ON THOSE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE OF QUITE A LOT OF FAMILIARITY WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS HOW THEY ARE REGULATED THAT PROCESS. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY YES. CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF THE IN DOESN'T IN THAT REALLY WELCOMES REGULATION AND SORT OF EMBRACES- CONSUMER PROTECTION WOULD YOU SAY. THEY TEND TO- FIGHT THESE PROPOSALS AS THEY'RE PRESENTED. QUITE HONESTLY I THINK IT DEPENDS- I THINK THERE I DO THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE- PLENTY OF. MISSION COMMITTED COMPANIES THAT SEE THE VALUE IN REGULATION THAT SEE THE VALUE PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETPLACE AND- AND SEE THEIR ROLE AS WORKING. HAND IN HAND AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH- WITH THEIR FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR- WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT TODAY HAS- GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH. ALL OF OUR THE LICENSEES WE HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR OUR TREAT ASSOCIATION THE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OUR LICENSEES- THERE ARE OF COURSE. ALWAYS GOING TO BE. CONCERN FOR. ANY NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN FINANCIAL SERVICES WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGE- THAT BECAUSE CHANGE IS HARD BUT YOU KNOW CHANGE IS ABOUT THE ONLY CONSTANT IN ANYONE'S LIFE AND MORE THAN ANYTHING I THINK IT'S THAT IT'S THAT CHANGE MANAGEMENT THAT IS THAT IS DIFFICULT AND COSTLY ON- ON COMPANIES WITHIN THE SPACE- BUT IS ALSO MY VIEW THAT CHANGE MANAGEMENT IS NOT- IT IS NOT UNIQUE TO REGULATION CHANGE MANAGEMENT IS A WAY OF LIFE. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE- CHANGING PREFERENCE THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF A CUSTOMER AGAIN HOW MANY MORE CUSTOMERS ACCESSING CAPITAL THROUGH ONE OF THESE THAN WALKING INTO BRICK AND MORTAR THAT PRESENT VERY PROFOUND- VERY PROFOUND CHALLENGES. UNDERSTANDABLE PALACE FOR COMPANIES PRODUCT IN THE. IT'S AND THEN OF COURSE WILL BE SOME OF AN ACTOR WITHIN THE PRODUCTS AND SPACE OUR THAT WILL BE ALLERGIC TO THE NAY OF REGULATION AND WILL WILL OBJECT TO- ANY ANY NOTION OF REGULATION OF ANY KIND OR OR INCREMENTAL REGULATION AND I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THAT THERE WILL OF COURSE ALWAYS BE SUBSTANCE OF ACTOR. WILL OBJECT TO REMAIN ALERT TO ANY KIND OF. SO FOR THOSE OF ACTORS HOW DO YOU HOW EVEN THE FIELD OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE. AT THAT YOU DESCRIBE AS A FOLKS THAT WERE WILLING TO- MORE LIKELY PARTNER WITH THE REGULATORS IN THE U. HAVE- SOME COMPANIES THAT SEEM TO BE A LARGER TERM REGULATIONS HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE'S PLAN BY THE SYMBOLS. WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO BRING TO BEAR ALL OF THE- ALL OF THE TOOLS. WITHIN A REGULATORS DISPOSAL- AGAIN TODAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE. THE ABILITY TO SUPERVISE EXAMINE- BORSIG NUMBER OF COMPANY IN ACTORS WITHIN FINANCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES ECOSYSTEM. ONE OF THE- ARE THERE WERE A COUPLE OF- REALLY IMPORTANT AND PROFOUND- ASPECTS TO DODD FRANK WHEN IT WHEN IT PASSED- ABOUT A DECADE AGO. ONE OF THE- PROFOUND ELEMENTS OF DODD FRANK WAS- THE WRECK IN THE RIGHT THE RECOGNITION AND THE NEED FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION THE NOTION THAT. THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS IN THE TYPES OF STE COMPANIES WITHIN THE SPACE WILL WILL ALWAYS CHANGE- VERY VERY RAPIDLY AND SO THERE WAS THAT THERE WAS A RECOGNITION FOR. THE NEED TO FUNCTIONALLY REGULATE THAT INDUSTRY AND THEN THE SECOND I THINK IMPORTANT INSIGHT- THAT THAT OFFERING TAUGHT US AND THAT WE BORROW FROM FOR THIS PURPOSE. IS D. VAN OF HAVING MULTIPLE TOOL TO BRING CARE TO A TO A PROBLEM SO GOING BACK TO YOUR OPTIONS. SEARCH IN IS THAT ARE FOR A ALLERGIC TO. AND DOES ONE DO AS OF RIGHT. THE ONE BRING TO BEAR THE TOOL AND ALL THE TOOLS RIGHT SO THAT'S EVERY FROM FROM EXAMINE. A COMPANY'S AND IT IS INDUSTRIES TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE. THE FINAL LEVEL WHAT ARE THE BUSINESS PRACTICES WHAT IS WORKING WHAT IS NOT WORKING FOR CUT CONSUMERS. USING YOUR ENFORCEMENT TOOLS- IF AND WHEN APPROPRIATE AND USING THEM IN SUCH A WAY AS TO AS TO ENCRYPT HAVE- GENERAL DETERRENT EFFECT AND TO ENCOURAGE- AND TO ENCOURAGE OTHER COMPANIES. TO REALLY LOOK CLOSELY WITH IN- AND ASK THEMSELVES HOW CAN WE DO BETTER BY OUR CUSTOMERS. YOU ALSO HAVE THE VERY IMPORTANT TOOLS AND FUNCTIONS- OF CONSUMER EDUCATION WE CAN'T- THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T FIGHT THIS FIGHT ON ITS OWN IRREGULAR THERE CAN'T FIGHT THIS ON ITS OWN YOU NEED- YOU NEED TO EDUCATE AND INFORM CONSUMERS SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE CHOICES. IF I NEED A LOT. SO IN IN YOUR YOU KNOW AS- A GIVEN NUMBER YOUR YOU SPELL I A REGULATOR AND INVOLVED AND- OVERSIGHT OF THIS INDUSTRY. AS YOU OBSERVE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- AND THIS IS JUST AN OBSERVATION- DO YOU DO YOU FEEL THAT IT'S- EASY TO PASS- CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION OVER DIFFICULT TO PASS BECAUSE SOME PROTECTION LEGISLATION. I YEAH I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT IS- IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO- TO ADDRESS CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES THROUGH THROUGH LEGISLATION. BUT I BUT I I'M SORRY THE GRANT. AB BUT BUT TO BE CLEAR I OF COURSE I'VE I'VE NEVER. I CANNOT SPEAK TO FIRSTHAND THE- THE TYPES CHALLENGES OR THE PROCESS SEES THAT THE LEGISLATURE GOES THROUGH. WELL IS THE I THINK OUR PRECIOUS TIME YOU CAN'T BE FIRST HAND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM DIEGO FIRST SHE TALK ABOUT. THIS IS A LIKE INTO LEGISLATURE TOGETHER TO THIS IS HER YEAR ON THE BANKING COMMITTEE IN IN HER A THE LEGISLATURE HAS FALLEN SHORT IN TERMS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ESPECIALLY. IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA IN FACT A THE LAST TIME I THINK THE LEGISLATURE DID SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THIS AREA WAS. THE HOMEOWNERS BILL OF RIGHTS IN RESPONSE TO THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS. AND THAT WAS A PARTICULAR CRISIS WHERE AGAIN- WE AS A COUNTRY WE STATE. FELL SHORT AND THEN WE S. TAXPAYERS WERE ASKED TO BAIL OUT THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SO NOT ONLY DO WE FOR THE SHORT IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS. WELL WE. HAD TO PAY THE BILL. AND SO THE STATE. ARE HIGH IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO IT RIGHT IT POTENTIALLY. COMESBACK AND HITS THE TAXPAYERS. BECAUSE THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE. THAT'S SINCE TWO BAKER. BECAUSE WE NEED A FINANCIAL INDUSTRY NEED OVER IN THIS WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY DECIDE WHETHER WITH WATER AND WE ACTUALLY NEED TO HAVE ONE ON AND SO THIS IS THIS IS A CONSTANT. THAT IF IT'S NOT THANK THEN. THESE EVEN POSITIONS NINETY PER THE AFTER PRETTY SMALL. BECAUSE THE BILLION IN TWENTY DOLLARS ARE SPENT. A BILL THE INDUSTRY. ON I AM. VERY HONORED FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE- WORST OF THE LEADING. THE LEADERS IN THE FIFTH AREA IT'S A VERY INTO THAT'S VERY EXCITED HEREBY THE INNOVATIVE IN THIS. WOULD YOU SEE YOUR ROLE AND OF REALLY. PROVIDING SOME OVERSIGHT REGULATION GUIDANCE TO THIS PARTICULAR DISTRICT. WELL I THINK MY ROLE THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSIONER OF THIS DEPARTMENT ITIT'S- IT'S MULTI FACETED AND AGAIN RELIES ON- VARIETY OF TOOLS AT THE DEPARTMENT'S DISPOSAL- FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK I THINK MY ROLE IS TO. PRESERVE IT TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY SO THAT IT IS SAFE FOR CONSUMERS AND CUSTOMERS TO INTERACT WITH- AND SO THAT IT IS IT IS VIBRANT AND ROBUST SO THAT- CONSUMERS HAVE. A GOOD CHOICES- AND SO IN THAT REGARD YOU KNOW IT'S PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY OF THE PRODUCTS WE HAVE. HAD TO MAKE SURETHAT CONSUME. REMAIN PROTECTED AS WELL AS LEAD WITH WITH CRITICAL. LIKE THE LEGISLATURE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- GOOD OUTCOME ARE CHIEF. FOR CONSUMERS. YOU KNOW LOOK PERSONALLY MY PERSONAL NOTE HERE I HAVE TO TWO YOUNG ONES AT HOME AND- OFTEN WHAT I WHAT I THINK ABOUT THROUGH MY DAY TO DAY IS WHAT KIND OF- WHAT KIND OF FINANCIAL ECOSYSTEM WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT DO I WANT THEM TO- TO EXPERIENCE BECAUSE- IT DIDN'T. PLENTY OF PEOPLE HAVE ACCUSED- THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY OF BEING OVERLY- A SO TERRIFIED AND I JUST DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY AT ALL I THINK- FINANCIAL SYSTEMS REPLACE SUCH A CRITICAL ROLE IN ESTABLISHING- IN IN IN ESTABLISHING THE BUILDING BLOCKS THAT WE ALL NEED TO BUILD THE KIND OF- LOTS OF WE WANT FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN WHETHER THAT BE ACHIEVING BETTER. IN OUR HEALTH CARE OR WHAT HAVE YOU SO CRITICAL. THE V. ABLE. ZERO THE HARD EARNED CAPITAL OF K. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE TO PARTY AND THAT AND VIBRANT SO THAT SO THAT EVERYONE CAN WIN I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE LIVE IN THERE ARE SOME GAMES. SO WHAT ONE OF THE- MAYBE THE COMMENTS THAT YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES- WERE CONCERNED OF THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE VERSES THE ROLE OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH- ONE OF THOSE GOALS. HAVE PUT FORWARD TO SORT OF BALANCE- SORT OF. CREDIT GREATER CHECKING BALANCES POTENTIALLY TO HAVE A SUNSET DATE- FOR THE AGENCY IT'S VERY COMMON WITHIN THE BUSINESS A PROFESSION- COMMITTEE WHICH I HAPPEN TO SIT ON- THAT. YOU KNOW NUMBER OF AGENCIES COME BACK FOR HOME REVIEW THE CALL CENTER REVIEW IT'S- AN OPPORTUNITY WERE- YOU HAVE TO YOU'LL GET YOUR- GET YOUR AGENCY OR YOUR DEPARTMENT OR YOUR COMMISSION. SORT OF REVIEW AND RE. I IS SOMETHING THAT YOU BE TO CONSIDERING. GET THE SHORT TIME BUT ALL THE I THE INTO REALLY HAVE CAN LEAD TO AND- I THINK IT'S A SOLUTION IN THE WE ARE. I HAVE WE WOULD LOVE TO DIAL ON MORE WE KEEPING UP MIND TO IF I MAY I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST IDENTIFY- A COROLLARY CONSIDERATION OF THAT I THINK WOULD WOULD BE WORTH- BEARING IN MIND AS PART OF THIS PART OF OUR ONGOING CONVERSATION. AND IS THERE THANK. SUCH A PIECE OF INITIAL THAT THAT THIS PRINT IF INTO. HI ORDER TO IMPLEMENT IT RELY ON. THE A BILL TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN- TOP TALENT- AND SO THE ONE CRITICAL OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE THERE IS IF THERE IS. IF THERE IS- IF THERE IS A MATCH. THAT UNDERMINES THE ABILITY TO- TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TOP TALENT THEN I WOULD FEAR THAT- I WOULD FEAR THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE PROPOSAL STARTS TO WOBBLE BUT I THINK I A DO THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT IS PROBABLY. SOMETHING THAT IS SOLVABLE I CAN BE THEY COULD BE MARRIED UP WITH- WITH THE IDEA YOU'VE YOU'VE PUT FORTH. I THINK THAT'SFOR A I THINK THIS TIRE STATE GOVERNMENT SACRAMENTO HAS A CHALLENGE WITH- ATTRACTING TOP TALENT TO. AS PART OF THE STATE I THINK IT'S NOT STUNT- I ISSUE FOR YOUR PARTICULAR AGENCY. HAVING SAID THAT A NUMBER OF OTHER AGAINST COMMISSION'S. DIVISIONS DEPARTMENTS- GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE- AND AGAIN I THINK GIVEN. GIVEN WHERE THIS PROPOSAL IS IN THIS PARTICULAR DATE AND TIME I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY ACTUALLY NEED TO HAVE. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE SUPPORTER OF MOVING ANYTHING- ANYTHING FOR I THINK YOU DO- YOU REALLY SHOULD SHOULD CONSIDER IT AND SORT OF WHAT WOULD BE- WHAT WOULD BE THE WAY TO. YEAR MAKE A WORK HAVING SAID THAT THE FIRST REVIEW OCCURS WE HEAR A IN THE TO. OR COMMISSIONS THAT THEY ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT- BEING ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK OR YOU SEE A- YOU SEE A TURNING OF EMPLOYEES IN FACT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SENSOR VIEWS VERY REGULARLY- EVERY YEAR. AND WE PROBABLY HERE OR ABOUT ANY NEGATIVE PARTICULARLY IMPACTS THE STAFF SO I THINK. I IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU TO. CONSULT YOUR- WHO HAVE TO GO. THROUGH THE PROCESS. THAT YOU VERY MUCH OF THE TURN OF NOW TO THE CHIRLA. THANK YOU CAN TANK I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS SOME. ON THE FIRST PLAY A AT I'LL SOME MET THEIR WAS MEANT ABOUT A LOT OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE TRAILER BILL ARE YOU SENSUALLY ALREADY COVERED UNDER EXISTING STATE OR FEDERAL LAW.% I THINK SOME EXAMPLE THAT MIGHT HELP FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. CAN YOU SEE EXAMPLES OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS THAT YOU RECEIVED BUT YOU CANNOT ACT ON AND THEN CAN YOU SHOW US HOW THAT WOULD CHANGE IF THIS PROPOSAL APPROVED. YEAH ABSOLUTELY- SO IN IN REVIEWING AND REVIEWING THE VARIOUS TYPES OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED SINCE MARCH- ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE A GOOD NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS- SPANNING ALL SORTS OF PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND SERVICES- HI THERE OF COURSE- COMPLAINTS AND CONTACTS ABOUT ABOUT. MORTGAGE AND MORTGAGE RELATED ISSUES BUT THERE WERE ALSO A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT- PERSONAL LOAN PRODUCTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WITH THEIR PURVIEW- ABOUT REFUNDS OWED FOR PRODUCTS FOR ONLINE TYPE PRODUCTS TO BE DON'T THE WE DON'T. ABOUT ABOUT DEBT OR OR CRY REPAIR TYPE SERVICES THAT WE CURRENTLY TOUCH AND I THINK THOSE ARE ALL THE ARE ALL ACT ILUSTRE EXAMPLE OF THE TYPES. AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTS. THAT WE- CAN'T CURRENTLY REACH WE DON'T KERN HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER FOR EXAMPLE THAT RESOLUTION A CREDIT REPAIR PRODUCTS- WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY- WITH RESPECT TO HAVE VARIOUS ASSET RECOVERY- COMPANIES THAT COLLECTION COMPANIES OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PRECISELY THE TYPES OF. ATTICS AND SERVICES THAT WOULD COME WITHIN COME WITHIN THE AMBIT OF THE DEPARTMENT- SHOULD SHOULD THE PROPOSAL- YOU KNOW WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU- THE NEXT QUESTION IS GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION THERE ARE MANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT D. E. B. O. IN PARTICULAR MIGHT BE CAN ABOUT SO CAN YOU SHARE WHAT THOSE PRODUCTS- MIGHT BE THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT REGULATING. CAN WE LOOK TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LAST DOWNTURN IN FORM OUR EXPECTATION OF WHAT MIGHT BE COMING DOWN THE ROAD. THANK YOU ALL ALL ALL STAR WITH THE LAST PART YOUR I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN. I THINK THE LAST DOWNTURN IS INSTRUCTIVE ABOUT- WHAT WE MAY EXPECT- AGAIN WELL I THINK IT IS IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO- TO IDENTIFY WITH PRECISION THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS OF THE TYPES OF SCHEMES THAT ARE LIKELY TO FLOURISH BUT AT ONE CAN. EVEN WE CAN GENERALIZE AROUND THE TYPES OF- ACTIVITY THAT THAT HAS STARTED TO EMERGE IT WILL LIKELY EMERGE AS AS THIS DOWNTURN PROCESS SO- SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW WE START WITH. WE START BY LOOKING AT THOSE CONSUMERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS TODAY THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES- THAT ARE LIKELY- THAT ARE LIKELY TO TARGET THOSE AT THOSE CONSUMERS ARE THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT PROMISE- SOME FORM OF RELIEF IN EXCHANGE FOR A FEE WHETHER IT'S SOME OF FROM FROM THE DEBT THEY'RE CARRYING IN EXCHANGE FOR RELIEF- SOME FORM OF RELIEF FROM- FROM MARS ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT IN EXCHANGE FOR RELIEF- OR- YOU KNOW SOME. OTHER SOME OTHER TYPE OF ACTIVITY AIMED AT AGAIN TAKING- I TO TAKE THE ALL. OF THE CONSUMER WHETHER THROUGH SOME COLLECTION ACTIVE OR THROUGH SOME THROUGH SOME. EXCHANGE FOR SERVICE AND THAT IS WHERE WE START TO SEE A LOT OF I PURCHASED IF YOUR BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE REPRESENTATION. WHAT IN OR OR THEY GO. I BELIEVE DAMAGING PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT. I FRANKLY THE COMMUNITIES OF AND A L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G AND&lt;/c&gt; HIGH INCOME INCOME COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT TO A FEW COME A DAY. HEARD YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS THAT MIGHT COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN AND I WANT POINT OUT COUPLE THING ONE. WHILE I IN. A PROPOSAL AND TWENTY NINETEEN REGARDING THIS ISSUE- IT ALWAYS CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THIS ISSUE COULD NOT BE A STAND ALONE POLICY ISSUE. THERE IS A BUDGET AT THAT IT WOULD MAKE THIS A PARTICULAR POLICY REAL SO IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOME KIND OF A BUDGET PROCESS. SO WE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE A PURE POLICY BILL AND WE WERE ALWAYS NEED A BUDGET PROCESS TO GO TO SO I'M GONNA. RECOGNIZED I THINK. NOT A WILL THERE'S JUST THAT WORK THERE'S NOT A WAY TO MAKE THEM HI UNLESS WE GO A BUDGET. AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMMENTS THE TIME OF THIS I JUST YOU KNOW ROOM FOLKS THAT WE INTRODUCED A BILL N pMARCH TWENTY EIGHT AND MARCH. AT WE INITIALLY THIS YEAR HAD A- HEARINGS GOT. EIGHTEENTH WE KNOW THAT TODAY'S. YOU KNOW AUGUST SIX BUT MARCH EIGHTEENTH WE HAD A HEARING SCHEDULED ABOUT THIS AND LIFE CHANGED OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL- WE'VE I WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. BUT WE KNOW THAT AND YOU KNOW HAVING WORKED ON THIS IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND ALSO SEEN THE FIRST TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY- A REDRAFT IN MAY. I THINK. IT LEGITIMATE I REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE PER DOCK. AT BEEN AVAILABLE FOR SOME INPUT. FOR SOMETIME WE JUST. REGRET BECAUSE OF THIS. HAVE NOT ABLE TO THE HEARINGS THAT WE ALL WANTED TO HAPPEN THAT WE WILL SCHEDULE. AT HOUSE I WOULD SAY THAT AT. THE EIGHTY SOLVE FOR. I AM AND WE IF THE STAFF HAVE. BEEN ENGAGED THIS YEAR. LICENSEES A THINK WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY EXAM. IT LICENSEES FROM MOST OF THE BILL- THERE IS ONE SECTION THAT IT'S STILL THERE AND THAT'S THE SECTION FOR YOU DATA. WHICH IS FOR THE PROHIBITION OF UNFAIR DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES. AND ENFORCEMENT THERE OF AND SO I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW AGAIN SHOWS THAT THE AMENDMENTS AND THE CHANGES SHOW THAT THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN HAPPENING- IN CERTAINLY- WE ALSO NEED TO ASK OURSELVES DO. FOR EXEMPTION KNOWING THAT. YEAH UNFAIR TO DEVELOP ACTS AND PRACTICES IS A PART OF THE FEDERAL LAW I'M SO THIS WOULD ALLOW STATES TO ADD A STATE AGENCY AT TO ONLINE TO THE FEDERAL TO THE FEDERAL LAW AND TO ALSO BE SURE AND THAT WE HAVE SOME WAY IN OUR STATE- TO PRESERVE WHAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT- IN THE END I THINK THAT ALL OF THESE AT. ANY TIME T. FOR ANY FINANCIAL AND CAN BE OF AND IF CONSUMERS ARE TREATED FAIRLY. AT THE BY LINE ONE. AND SO I THINK THE GOAL IS CREE AN THAT HELP ENHANCE THE TRADITIONS DO THE RIGHT THAT ADAM AND LOOK AT TRENDS THAT MAY BE HAPPY PERHAPS ON THE STATE REGIONAL BUT THIS THE GOAL IS NOT AND I GOT TO THE GOAL IS TO DO RIGHT FOR CONSUMERS CAN BEND MEANS THE SYSTEM IS WHAT. SO I THINK THAT'S A IMPORTANT MISSION BELL BUT A LOT ABOUT THE FIFTH I HAVE TO REMIND FOLKS THAT THERE'S ABOUT FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO ONE MORE ENFORCEMENT POSITION OR A MILLION. IS GOING THAT BREAK I'M- ACT THAT YOU KNOW I IT'S MUCH. YES I WAS WALKING THE BILL AND SOME WHO WORK HERE IN THE BUILDING. STOP ME AND SAY IT I KNOW YOU ON I THINK YOU AND FINANCE CHAIR AT ISSUES CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME SOME ADVICE ABOUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE A LICENSEE CONCERN- HAVE A CONCERN WITH CINCY AND HOW THEY QUE FAISAIT AND I REMEMBER MY DID. HUMILITY BUT THE BASE. OUR TEAM TO FIX THE- AND DON'T THINK EVERY LOOKING GO AFTER THEY JUST WANT TO HOW TO FIX A FINANCIAL PROBLEM PROBLEM WITH THE PRODUCT THAT THEY HAVE- INSTILL YOU KNOW IT'S- THIS IS. IF THIS ISN'T YOU KNOW HAPPENING ONA REGULAR BASIS AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHO TO TURN TO I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THEM. FIND SOMEONE I DON'T. BELIEVE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD I'D- END. SHE THAT WENT TO THE- SO IT'S PART OF THE FIRST INCREASE. THAT WE'VE SEEN AS AFFORD DBS IN TERMS CONCERN THAT HAVE BEEN. AND I THINK HEN WE'RE C. A 40% INCREASE THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL OF CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS THE FIFTH CENT INCREASE. AT THE FEDERAL WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS- AND FINALLY YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN AT COMMENTS MADE IN TERMS. OF THE SUN SETTING- OF THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE BUT WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP BASED IN. AUTHORITY INTACT AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY. IMPORTANT AGAIN. THE GOAL IS NOT THEY WERE ALL GET ENFORCED. YOU KNOW. YES SIR AMOUNT I AM I THINK THAT THEY HAS TO BE THE A- TO IT FOR A TO OUR KIDS. THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT. CRISIS OR NOT- THAT WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT THEY CAN SEE YOU KNOW BETTER BENEFIT FROM THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AT IT DOES NOT BENEFIT OUR STATE. AT TO SEE A WORLD WHERE OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES COLLAPSE EITHER AND THAT IS A CONCERN TO THE GOAL ISN'T TO WE GO AFTER. AN TO MAKE SURE THE WORKING WELL WITH ARKANSAS I KNOW THAT CALLS OF A LOT ABOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT- AND I WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT WE STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO RUN BILLS AND DIRECT ON SPECIFIC ISSUES. CERTAINLY THERE WAS REFERENCE MADE IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT A DEBT COLLECTION BILL THAT'S COMING THROUGH THE PROCESS WHICH I THINK IS AN EXAMPLE- OF OUR ABILITY TO KEEP INFLUENCE. AT THE WORK DVL IN THIS MODEL OR IN ANOTHER MODEL SO- WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR PATH YOUR NAME ALL THE PANELISTS FOR YOUR INFORMATION FOR THE FEEDBACK. I WANT TO THANK OUR CALL FOR AT GOOD IN THE DIALOGUE I APPRECIATE THAT WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS ISN'T A PART. ISSUE WANT THING THINK. THE TWINS.
