SEVENTY ONE WHICH CELEBRATES JANUARY TWENTY SECOND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AS THE FORTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ROE V. WADE CASE. AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL THE WAY AWARE ROBY WADE WAS DECIDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE AND IT WAS A PIVOTAL SUPREME COURT CASE THAT SECURED EVERY WOMAN'S RIGHT TO ACCESS AN ABORTION. AS SOON AS WOMEN ONE THAT'S RIGHT HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTLESS ORGANIZED MOVEMENTS TO REVERSE IT YET FORTY FIVE YEARS LATER ROE V. WADE HAS STOOD STRONG. EFFETE WE WISH TO RECOGNIZE IN THIS RESOLUTION. HR SEVENTY ONE ALSO COMMEMORATE PLANNED PARENTHOOD AS ONE OF THE PARTNERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT AT ONE OF OUR PARTNERS AND ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S LEADING PROVIDERS OF QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR WOMEN IN NEED. FOR OVER A CENTURY SERVING APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PATIENTS A YEAR SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF WHICH ARE WITHIN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE POVERTY LEVEL. PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS A TRUSTED PROVIDER OFFERING PRIMARY PREVENTATIVE CARE THAT IS VITAL TO WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. IN PARTICULAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAD PROVIDED THESE MUCH NEEDED SERVICES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WITCHES. NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART WHERE SERVICES ARE SCARCE AND COST PROHIBITIVE. DESPITE THE SERVICES AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS THIS ORGANIZATION PROVIDES THAT HELPS LOW INCOME WOMEN WHO MAY OTHERWISE NOT RECEIVE CARE. BOTH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS INVOLVING FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS CONTINUALLY PUTTING QUESTION BY OPPOSING FORCES. THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TO PRESENT HR SEVENTY ONE TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE VITAL SERVICES THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AND MEN RELY ON AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

ON AS YOU HEARD NEXT MONDAY IS THE FORTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT LANDMARK DECISION ON ROE V. WADE. THIS HISTORIC RULING AFFIRMS THAT EVERY WOMAN HAS THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO AN ABORTION WHICH IS A MEDICAL PROCEDURE THAT NEARLY ONE AND FOR WOMEN. WILL AVAIL HERSELF OF IN HER LIFETIME. ACCESS TO REPURPOSE HEALTHCARE INCLUDING ABORTION ENSURES THAT WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE IF. WHEN AND WITH WHOM TO HAVE CHILDREN. THIS CONTROL OVER ONE'S BODY IS CRITICAL FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL BEING. IF YOU SUPPORT WOMEN HAVING ACCESS TO BASIC HEALTH CARE. THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENSURE WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HOME TO NEARLY TWENTY MILLION WOMEN.

FIFTEEN TWENTY SIX BY MISTER KALRA RIGHT I'M NUMBER ONE MR GLORIA PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I THINK TO ALLOW THE PRESENT AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. THIS IS SIMILAR LAST YEAR'S AB TWO THIRTY THREE WHICH YOU WAS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE. THE BILL ENHANCES THE DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF STUDENTS TO WEAR CULTURAL ADORNMENTS AT GRADUATION CEREMONIES. UNDER EXISTING LAW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PERMITTED TO DEVELOP REASONABLE DRESS CODE POLICIES THAT FOSTER POSITIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND PROTECT THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF STUDENTS. UNFORTUNATELY SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS ADMINISTRATORS HAVE A TEENY ENFORCED WHAT ARE KNOWN AS NON DORMANT POLICIES THAT PREVENT STUDENTS FROM WEARING CULTURAL CEREMONIAL AND RELIGIOUS ADORNMENTS AT GRADUATION CEREMONIES. SEVERAL INCIDENTS INVOLVING NATIVE AMERICAN STDENTS CALIFORNIA ATTEMPTING TO WEAR EAGLE FEATHERS REVEAL THAT THESE POLICIES PREVENT STUDENTS FROM RECOGNIZING CULTURAL TRADITIONS ARE CELEBRATING THEIR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY BE UNFAMILIAR THE EAGLE FEATHER IS A SYMBOL REPRESENTING PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT AND ONCE PASSAGE INTO ADULTHOOD. OF THIS PROGRAM THIS PROBLEM HOWEVER IS NOT RESERVED R. UNIQUE JUST NATIVE AMERICANS IN OUR STATE. IN NEARBY ELK GROVE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENT WAS PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING IN HIS GRADUATION CEREMONY. AFTER REFUSING TO REMOVE A KENTE CLOTH. BUT PROTECTING A PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO WEAR CULTURAL GARMENTS A SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONIES AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT ENHANCES THE DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. MIND TENSION THIS YEAR IS TO SYDNEY IS TO SIT DOWN WITH THE OPPOSITION TO NEGOTIATE LANGUAGE THAT BALANCES THE STUDENT'S RIGHT TO. FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WHILE. WITH THE SCHOOLS EQUALLY UNQUESTIONED RIGHT AT TO PREVENT DISRUPTION OF IMPORTANT SCHOOL FUNCTIONS WITH ME TODAY AS I HAVE CATHOLIC FOR AND THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU EITHER. THANK YOU WHEN ISN'T SUPPORT THE MORNING CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT IS AN INFANT NEEDED CLARIFICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF STUDENTS TO WEAR RELIGIOUS CEREMONIAL OR CULTURAL ADORNMENTS AT SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONIES. THE SEMINAL SO YOU S. SUPREME COURT CASE OF TINKER VERSUS TO MOINS INVOLVES EXPRESSION BY THE WEARING OF AN ITEM. IN THAT CASE BLACK ARMBANDS TO PROTEST THE VIETNAM WAR. THE SUPREME COURT HELD THAT STUDENTS RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ALLOW THIS TYPE OF PROTEST SO LONG AS IT DID NOT DISRUPT THE OPERATION OF THE SCHOOL. THIS TYPE OF EXPRESSION IS ALSO PROTECTED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. STUDENTS SHOULD EQUALLY BE ABLE TO WEAR ADORNMENTS AS AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL HERITAGE AGAIN AS THE BILL MAKES CLEAR SO LONG AS DOING SO IS NOT DESTRUCTIVE. BY CLARIFYING THE LAW AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT WILL PROTECT STUDENTS RIGHTS AND OFFER GUIDANCE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO AS TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR UNNECESSARY LITIGATION. AS ANYONE WHO HAS ATTENDED A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY KNOWS IT IS A JOYFUL AN IMPORTANT CEREMONY FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT IS A TIME FOR CELEBRATION NOT ONLY OF THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AND WHAT HE OR SHE HAS JUDGED ACCOMPLISHED BUT ALSO OF EVERYONE WHO HELPED GET THE STUDENT TO THAT POINT. THE FAMILY AND THE HERITAGE OF THE STUDENT. IT IS ALSO THE MARKING OF AN IMPORTANT TRANSITION. STUDENTS WHO ARE MARKING THAT TRANSITION SHOULD CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BE ABLE TO WEAR THE ADORNMENTS THAT THEIR CULTURES USE ON SUCH OCCASIONS. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. A TEAR MEMBERS FRIGHTENINGLY NO BEHALF OF THE SAME NAME AS MANAGE EMISSIONS IN THE SALMON WHAT BAND OF MISSION INDIANS IN SUPPORT. CHAIR MEMBER SEAN FLANIGAN ABOUT OFFICE QUAN TRAVESTY DIEGO IN STRONG SUPPORT MAKE THANK YOU. IT. SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND THE SECOND ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS NANCY CHINA SINCE BEEN ALSO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. ONCE AGAIN WE MUST REGRETFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL OF REALLY DUE TO THE APPROACH THAT IT TAKES SO PAGE FIVE THE SECOND PARAGRAPH IN YOUR ANALYSIS POSITS THAT. UNDER THIS BILL THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD STILL AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE STANDARD THAT SAYS THAT. THEY COULD BORROWED ADORNMENT IF IT WAS LIKELY TO CAUSE A SUBSTANTIAL DISRUPTION BUT UNDER A LEGAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN THIS BILL WE FIND THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE. THE SOLD LEGAL FOUNDATION TO USE SUCH A DEFENSE AND IN FACT THE VERY PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL WOULD LIKELY SU LOCAL EDUCATION SCHOOL DISTRICTS IF THEY TRY TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS. SO THAT IS OUR CONCERN WITH THE APPROACH IN THIS BILL WE THINK THAT IT ACTUALLY. IT IT GOES FARTHER THAT IT NEEDS TO TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR SO WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. AND HOPEFULLY. COMING TO SOME MUTUALLY AGREEABLE AND SOLUTION IN THE FUTURE AND AND ONE VERY MINOR FACTUAL CORRECTION THE ELK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT DID NOT PROVIDE A A STUDENT FROM PARTICIPATING IN GRADUATION. I DON'T THINK IT'S MATERIAL TO SEE S. B. A.'S POSITION BUT I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT ON THE RECORD UNDER THE SITUATIONAL CERTAINLY MISHANDLED. BUT THE STUDIO WAS NOT PREVENTED FROM. SPITTING IN THE CEREMONY. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEN NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. AS GLORIA NO THAT. WELL THIS PASSED THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE FAIRLY READILY AYE I UNDERSTAND CSPA ITS CONCERNS AND AND THE NOTE FOR DISRUPTION BUT I THINK. WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BALANCE THE NEED FOR SOME CULTURAL PROTECTIONS HERE FOR STUDENTS WHO. AND WHO DO HAVE. SOMETHING OF CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE THAT THEY WANT TO. BRING TO A CEREMONY LIKE THIS TO TO BE ABLE TO CELEBRATE TIED APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM. MEMBERS.
