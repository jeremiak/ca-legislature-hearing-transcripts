THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND HIS TEAM MEMBERS. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE WHY WE SEEKING TO AMEND THE LAW IN CALIFORNIA IS THERE LEGITIMATE PURPOSE. AND THE JUDGMENT PURPOSE HERE IS THAT WE HAVE A HISTORY WITH THE JANITORIAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A JANITORIAL BUSINESS ON MAKE IT SHORT. HE THE GENTLE BUSINESS WHICH IS UNIQUE BECAUSE THERE'S EXTRAORDINARILY DOWNWARD PRESSURE FOR COMPETITION IN CONTRACT OUT JANITORIAL SERVICES YOU KNOW MATTER OF FACT IS THAT THE REPORT HERE CALLED RACE TO THE BOTTOM REALLY A MAKES THE POINT OF BY BERKELEY SOME OF IT BACK IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH RESPECT TO THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY FOLKS IN THIS BUSINESS AND SO THE QUESTION IS CAN WE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD- RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS WHAT CAN WE DO THAT'S CREATIVE IN THE LAW. TO INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR THAT AVOIDS THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE TO PUT THIS DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THESE FOLKS THAT ARE ALWAYS PUSHED TO THE BOTTOM. THIS UNBELIEVABLE COMPETITION AND SO THIS MEASURE. WHICH DEALS WITH OUR- EXEMPTING JANITORIAL SERVICES NEARLY CRAFTED UP FROM PAGA IF THE EMPLOYEES WORK IS COVERED BY A VALID COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT COVERS THIS ISSUE. WE THINK IT'S A CREATIVE APPROACH IN THAT REGARD AND SO I WILL CUT IT SHORT SINCE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY VERY STEAMED WITH THIS.
