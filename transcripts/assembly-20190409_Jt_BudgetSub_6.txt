IN THE FUTURE -- AND I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT TO ADD THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE PUT INTO. I TRYING TO TRANSFORM THIS DEPARTMENT FOR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK MISS FRAZIER. MR TING THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY -- AT THIS HEARING. AS I SAID LAST YEAR'S JOINT HEARING IN MANY WAYS THE DMV IS THE FACE OF CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT. IT IS THE AGENCY THAT CALIFORNIA'S MOST OFTEN INTERACT IN SOME WITH IN SOME WAY. WHETHER IT'S FOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION OBTAINING A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR RENEWING A DRIVER'S LICENSE. GOING FORWARD. SINCE OUR HEARING LAST AUGUST WE'VE SEEN A MODEST. IMPROVEMENT AT THE DMV WAIT TIMES ARE DOWN ABOUT AN AVERAGE OF AN HOUR. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT OVER ONE THOUSAND NEW EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN HIRED AT FIELD OFFICES. DMV IS ALSO EXPAND THE USE OF CHAOS TO GIVE CONSUMERS MORE OPTIONS FOR COMPLETING THEIR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS. DMV IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEEN. IN FACT THE ENVY IS PROVIDING MONTHLY WAIT TIME REPORTS TO US. RECENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS COMPLETED AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF THE CHALLENGES DMV IS FACING. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IS MADE DMV A PRIORITY WHICH I APPRECIATE IS THE CHAIR. SO FAR I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND THE DMV STRIKE TEAMS EFFORTS TO MAKE MUCH NEEDED REFORMS. THAT BEING SAID I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES DMV IS CURRENTLY REQUESTING. FOR THE COMING YEAR. SIMPLY ADDING MORE EMPLOYEES IS NOT ENOUGH AS THE DEPARTMENT -- FINANCE ON IT HIGHLIGHTS. DMV IS HAS TO TAKE MORE STEPS TO MAKE SURE THE USER EXISTING WORKFORCE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE MANNER. FURTHER WELL WAIT TIMES ARE DOWN WHAT FROM LAST SUMMER THEY HAVE YET TO MEET THE THE FORTY FIVE MINUTE GOAL THAT THEY HAD SAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE STRIKE TEAM. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ACTING DIRECTOR KATHLEEN WEB WHOSE I'VE HAD MANY MEETINGS WITH AND I APPRECIATE HER TAKING THIS ON AND HOW WE GET AS THE LEGISLATURE CAN. BECOME A PARTNER. WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION FIXING THE AGENCY SO MANY OF US CAN INTERACT ON A REGULAR BASIS INSTEAD OF WHEN IT'S CONSIDERED. EMERGENCY. THANK YOU MISTER TAKE. THANK MISTER ANY OTHER COMMENTS OPENING COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MR BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER AT AND MISTER CHAIR AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A LITTLE BIT LATE BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DAYS IS IN THAT -- THE DMV HAS BEEN HAVING ONE OF THOSE DAYS FOR COUPLE HERE SO NOW AND AND I WANT TO BE PROACTIVE AND HELPFUL IN. FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN MOVE THE DEPARTMENT FORWARD WILL BE SPENDING CUT CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME PROVIDING OVERSIGHT IN REVIEWING THE OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL -- I IN MY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION HERE TODAY AND AND OF THE HOURS THAT WILL SPEND TOGETHER IN COMMITTEE. I THINK THIS BILL MISS SMITH. THANK YOU TO OUR CHAIRS TODAY AND I I ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTS -- FROM MY COLLEAGUE UNFORTUNATELY I THINK MINE IS ONE OF THE DISTRICTS PERHAPS WHERE WE HAVEN'T SEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT -- FROM THE DAY THAT I WAS FIRST WORN IN A NUMBER OF OUR CONSTITUENT CALL THE DOCTOR VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER HAVE BEEN DIEM BE RELATED AND HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUES HERE. FOR MANY THAT IS THEIR FIRST AND SOMETIMES ONLY INTERACTION WITH OUR STATE'S GOVERNMENT AND SO -- I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BE HERE TODAY MY COLLEAGUES IN ON PUTTING THIS PANEL TOGETHER. AND AND ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M HERE TO SAY IS HELP ME HELP YOU. BECAUSE I'VE EVEN ASK MYSELF I HAVE BEEN RECENT VISIT TO THE DMV TO GET MY REAL ID I SAID WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS WHAT ARE THE SILOS WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO HELP WITH. THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR CONSTITUENCIES BETTER SO I THINK YOU -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE HERE WILLING TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU MISTER. NEITHER OPENING COMMENTS. LET ME TO START VERY QUICKLY THIS IS A FOLLOW UP HEARING FROM OUR HEARING. IN AUGUST SOME OF YOU ARE HERE AGAINST MOVE YOUR NEW TO THAT HEARING BUT JUST TO REFRESH EVERYONE'S MEMORY -- THAT HEARING WAS HELD BECAUSE OF THE ATROCIOUS WAIT TIMES THAT WERE OCCURRING ALL AROUND THE STATE. NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT OF SAN FRANCISCO BUT REALLY IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE AND UNFORTUNATELY -- THE DEPARTMENT -- WAS LATE TO THE GAME AND REALLY REACTING HAVING A PLAN -- I DO WANT TO COMMEND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THEIR VERY GOOD AUDIT THAT THEY JUST FINISHED. ABOUT UNFORTUNATE WHEN WE HEAR LAST IN AUGUST THERE WERE APPROPRIATION REQUEST. WE DID OUR PART IN MAKING SURE THAT THE BUDGET THAT WAS PASSED IN JUNE HAD APPROPRIATE. APPROPRIATION WE ALSO DID OUR PART TO DO AUGMENTATION LATER ON IN THE FALL. UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THAT AUGMENTATION WENT TO STAFF THE STAFF WERE HIRED WITH THE AUDIT DEMONSTRATED WAS. THE STAFF PORTRAIT. SO IT JUST IN MY EYES SMALL OBSERVATION STOP THAT WERE DEPLOYED AT DIFFERENT OFFICES WERE EITHER STANDING AROUND REALLY NOT ABLE TO DO -- THE MOST BASIC DUTIES THEY WERE JUST STANDING AROUND HANDING OUT FORMS RATHER THAN ACTUALLY BEING BEHIND THE COUNTER -- TRAINED ON THE COMPUTERS ABLE TO SERVE IN PROCESS CUSTOMERS -- WE WERE TOLD BY BY THEN -- BY THE DâN DIRECTOR THAT ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS AROUND WAIT TIMES WAS EVERY. EVERY -- FIELD OFFICE WAS GONNA GET WAS GONNA GET TABLETS OF THE TABLETS GOING TO BE USE REAL TIME TO REALLY HELP MANAGE WAIT TIMES WHAT WE FIND. WE FOUND THAT YES THE TABLETS WERE PURCHASED. BUT THEN NOT USED. SO AGAIN IF WE APPROVE NEW COMPUTERS AND YOU BY THE NEW COMPUTERS IS GREAT BUT THE JUST SIT IN THE BOX IN YOUR DMV FIELD OFFICES I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MEETS -- OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. WHAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE? SPENT ON IN ADDITION WE TALKED ABOUT SHE SHE VERY PROBABLY TALKED ABOUT THE TEXTING SOFTWARE THAT WAS TO BE USED AT THE FIELD OFFICES. SO AGAIN SOFTWARE WAS USED. SOFTWARE WAS I PURCHASED SO SO THE LICENSES I ASSUME WERE THERE. WE GUESS WHAT. THEY WERE USED. SO THE QUESTION COMING BEFORE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE IS. YOU HAVE. A 10220% -- REQUEST. TO TO INCREASE YOUR BUDGET BY 10220% YOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. TO BE INCREASED BY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. COM. HOW HOW CAN YOU GIVE US THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL BE SPENT CORRECTLY? AND IT WILL BE SPENT EFFICIENTLY -- WALL ARE -- TRANSPORTATION CHURCH CORRECT -- THE WAIT TIMES ARE DOWN SO THAT'S GOOD -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE COULD BE COMING IN FOR REAL ID'S. SO WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THE NEXT TWO FIVE YEARS TO REALLY -- DEPLOY RESOURCES WE WE SAW -- WHAT'S PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THE FINANCE ON ITS RECOMMENDATION AND I GUESS WHO ARE WE GIVING THE MONEY. TO SO THE PREVIOUS DIRECTOR. WHO IS NO LONGER HERE DECIDE TO RETIRE WHICH I THINK WAS A SMART MOVE BEFORE COMING BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE -- SWORE TO US THAT THEY WERE IMPLEMENTING ALL THESE THINGS. AND THEN HIGH TAILED IT OUT OF TOWN. AND DIDN'T DIDN'T DO IT. SO WHY SHOULD WE GIVE YOU AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF RESOURCES TO SPEND ON TO SPEND ON TABLETS THAT'S IN THE CLOSET AND TO SPEND ON SOFTWARE THAT'S NOT USED IN TO SPEND ON PEOPLE THAT ARE TRAINED. SO IF YOU COULD ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS -- WOULD WELCOME NOT TO THE IN THIS COMMITTEE -- AGAIN WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PANELS AND SEGMENTS SO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA BE A FIRST JUST GETTING SOME BACKGROUND -- AND THEN TALKING ABOUT THE WAIT TIMES UPDATE THE WE HAVE. A DISCUSSION ON THE EVALUATION OF THE DMV OPERATIONS WITH THE STRIKE TEAM COME BEFORE THEN ARE GOING FORWARD WE HAVE THE DISCUSSION AROUND CURRENT YEAR AND A YEAR AND BUDGET YOUR FUNDING REQUESTS BUT LET'S -- LET'S BEGIN -- ACTING DIRECTOR ACTING DIRECTOR WITH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN TING AND FRAZIER INSURE ONE PATRON NORRIS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM KATHLEEN WEB. I AM THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND WITH ME TODAY IS ROBBIE CROCKETT OR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. AND COLLEAGUES SOLOMON OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FIELD OPERATIONS DIVISION AND WE HOPE TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS -- THE THAT YOU HAVE RAISED HERE -- AMONG ALL OF YOU -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE YOU AND ADDRESS OUR PROGRESS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING AND REDUCING WAITING TIMES IMPLEMENTING REAL ID. AND THE PROGRESS THAT IS BEING MADE TO REINVENT THE DMV. NOT ONLY AT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVEL. BUT ALSO AT THE TOP OF THE ORGANIZATION. AS THE NEW ACTING DIRECTOR I AM EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MODERNIZE THE DMV OPERATIONS. AND THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO NOLLIE BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS. BUT TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND TRUST BACK INTO THE DEPARTMENT. THAT HAS SEEN STRUGGLES LEAD TO PUBLIC FRUSTRATION. AND GOVERNMENT EMBARRASSMENT. LATER ON YOU'LL HEAR FROM SECRETARY VOUCHER AND WE BOTH SHARE A PERSPECTIVE. IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS. FOCUSED UPON DELIVERING SERVICES. TO CUSTOMERS IN THE WAY THEY WANT US TO DELIVER IT. THE DMV IS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT ACTION TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. AS FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS ARE CERTAINLY NEEDED. ADDITIONALLY WE ALSO NEED TO THINK OF CREATING THE DMV IN THE FUTURE. THIS REQUIRE A COMMITMENT FROM THE WHOLE TEAM AT DMV AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THIS. I'M ALSO VERY APPRECIATIVE THE SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY STRIKE TEAM WITH THIS EFFORT AND THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE BEEN MAKING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DELIVERING EASILY AND EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PERFORMANCE AUDIT REVEALED THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY CHALLENGES FACING DMV. MUCH IMPROVEMENT IS NEEDED AT ALL LEVELS OF DMV'S OPERATION AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. INDEED NEW LEADERSHIP NEW INSPIRATION. NEW IDEAS ARE ALL NEEDED IN THIS PROCESS OF REINVENTING. THE MOST PUBLICLY ACCESS DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE. SO I'M HERE TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION. I AM PAYING ATTENTION. AND I TAKE THIS AUDIT VERY SERIOUSLY KNOWING WE NEED TO INSTILL. MORE THAN EVER. GOOD FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES AND PRACTICES. AND GREAT WORK PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS TO ACHIEVE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES. THIS WILL HELP THE LEGISLATURE IN KNOWING THAT THE DMV IS MANAGING ITS RESOURCES AND DELIVERING ON ITS COMMITMENTS. DAVIES FUTURE DEPENDS ON IT AND EVERY RECOMMENDATION THE PERFORMANCE ON IT WILL BE THOROUGHLY EVALUATED RESPONDED TO IN OUR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WITHIN THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS. AS I MENTIONED THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS TOWARD SOMETHING BETTER. THE DMV THE FUTURE. IS AN ACHIEVABLE DESTINATION WE CAN GET THERE TOGETHER WITH MANY ADDITIONAL PREVENTS IN THE SHORT TERM AND OTHERS COMING OVER TIME. THE DMV IS COMMITTED TO REDUCING WAIT TIMES FOR CUSTOMERS OFFERING MORE EXTERNAL SERVICE CHANNELS TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR FIELD OFFICE VISITS. AND WITH THE HELP OF OUR PARTNERS RE IMAGINING DELIVERING SERVICES IN WAYS THAT CUSTOMERS WANT THEM. TO BE LIVER NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. THIS MEANS IMPROVING REAL ID TRANSACTIONS. IMPROVING REAL ID OUTREACH IMPROVING REAL ID TRAINING. DEVELOPING BETTER FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER FLOWS STRATEGIES. DEPLOY MORE SELF SERVICE TERMINALS PROVIDING MORE CUSTOMER SERVICES ONLINE AND THROUGH OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND RESHAPING THE DMV DECISION MAKING PROCESS AT AN ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL. AND WHAT I MEAN BY RESHAPING IS THAT FOR FAR TOO LONG. DMV'S DECISION MAKING HAS BEEN A TOP DOWN HIERARCHY. THAT RESULTED IN REACTIVE DECISION MAKING MADE AT THE VERY TOP OF THE ORGANIZATION. BUT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS. THERE ARE MANY EMPLOYEES AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION WHO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING. THE HOW TO MAKE MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS TO DMV. A MORE ROBUST ENGAGE ENTERPRISE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT EMPHASIZES AND EXAMINES THE BEST SOLUTIONS AS A TEAM. WE'LL HAVE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY ASSURING THOSE SOLUTIONS ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. LAST SUMMER. WAIT TIMES WERE EXTREME AN UNACCEPTABLE. I WISH TO APOLOGIZE TO EACH OF YOU AND ALL OF OUR VALUED CUSTOMERS WHO HAD TO EXPERIENCE A LONG WAIT TIMES. I WISH TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. THAT'S SINCE LAST AUGUST THE DEPARTMENT OF SUCCESSFULLY REDUCE THE AVERAGE STATEWIDE WAIT TIME BY NINETY ONE MINUTES. AS MAINTAIN AN AVERAGE STATEWIDE WAIT TIME OF ONE HOUR OR LESS SINCE OCTOBER. DMV IS ACHIEVED ITS OVERALL WAIT TIME GOALS IN THE PAST CONSECUTIVE MONTHS SINCE OCTOBER. IN ALL THE DMV IS ACHIEVED ITS GOALS THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT OUR WORK IS DONE. DMV WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT CUSTOMER SERVICE REDUCE WAIT TIMES ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE A DMV FIELD OFFICES. AND PROVIDE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR ADDED CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL FIELD OFFICE. OUR SUCCESS REDUCING WAIT TIMES IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SOLUTIONS FUNDED THROUGH PRIOR BUDGET ALLOCATIONS. AND WE DO SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATOR SUPPORT AND FUNDING. HIRING NINE HUNDRED TEMPORARY NEW EMPLOYEES BY OCTOBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TRIAGE IN CUSTOMERS WAITING TO APPROVE AN EX BUT I HANDLING OF TRANSACTIONS. USING SMART TABLETS TO CHECK CUSTOMERS INTO THE QUEUE FASTER AND TO ALSO ASSIST CUSTOMERS WITH ASSESSING. ACCESSING ONLINE SERVICES AND TO SCHEDULE APPOINTMENT. PROVIDING AN EXPEDITE LINE FOR EASIER TRANSACTIONS LIKE OBTAINING A DRIVING RECORD OR PICKING UP LICENSE PLATES AND THE SABBATH DISABLE PLACARDS. PROVIDING TEXT MESSAGE NOTIFICATIONS TO CUSTOMERS SO THEY CAN HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO LEAVE THE DMV FIELD OFFICES. AND RETURN WHEN THEIR QUEUE NUMBER IS TO BE CALLED. IMPROVED INTEGRATION OF OUR DRIVERS LICENSE APPLICATION PROCESS SO THAT TECHNICIAN KEYSTROKES ARE REDUCED AND CUSTOMERS SPEND LESS TIME AND A TECHNICIAN WINDOW. ADDITIONAL SERVICE HOURS SEVEN AM START TIME IN SIXTEEN OFFICES. AND SATURDAY SERVICES AT SIXTY TWO OFFICES FROM EIGHT AM TO FIVE PM. ENHANCING OFFICE PERFORMERS EFFICIENCIES AS SOME FIELD OFFICES FOR CUSTOMERS WAITING BY PRE SCREENING THEIR DOCUMENTS SO WHEN THEY ARRIVE IN A TECHNICIAN WINDOW. THE DOCUMENT REVIEW IS ALREADY COMPLETE REDUCES THE TRANSACTION PROCESSING TIME. MONITORING FIELD OFFICE WAIT TIMES A REAL TIME THROUGH THE DMV COMMAND CENTER. AND OFFERING SERVICES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE VISITING A FIELD OFFICE. WE ACKNOWLEDGE WE SUBMITTED SIGNIFICANT BUDGET REQUEST FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY TO THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED FURTHER IN PANEL. THREE WE DO NOT TAKE THIS LIGHTLY. AND WE MUST BE GOOD STEWARDS OF RESOURCES AND FUNDING GRANTED. AND TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT OUR EFFORTS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE PUBLIC TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND TRUST. BUT ON THE ISSUE OF WAIT TIMES I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A FIELD OFFICE CONCERN. IT IS ALSO A CONCERN DMV'S CALL CENTERS. THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER CALL WAIT TIME IS FIFTEEN MINUTES. AND THE MAXIMUM WAIT TIME IS BEEN AS HIGH AS TWO HOURS TO ALMOST FIVE HOURS DURING PEAK PERIODS. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE AND EVEN WITH FEATURES THAT INCLUDE VIRTUAL HOLD. PROVIDING A CALLBACK TO CUSTER WHEN A CALL CENTER REPRESENTATIVES AVAILABLE. THIS VIRTUAL HOLD ALSO GETS OVER PRESCRIBED IS NOT AVAILABLE TO ALL CUSTOMERS. DO YOU MAY WANT TO ENSURE THAT ALL CUSTOMERS CONTACTING DMV BY PHONE OR ONLINE OUR TIMELY SERVED IN DO NOT ENCOUNTER A LONG FRUSTRATING WAIT TIMES. THAT'S WHY DMV IS PROPOSING NEW SERVICES THAT ARE WIDELY USED BY ALMOST EVERY MAJOR RETAILER. SERVICES LIKE LIVE CHAT IN CUSTOMER SERVICE EMAIL. ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO CONTACT VIA THE INTERNET TO A REAL DMV REPRESENT OF WHO CAN LAND CUSTOMER SYSTEMS. AND CHAT BOT VIRTUAL REPRESENTATIVE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE ON SOME OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND TOPICS OF DMV. THESE ARE JUST TWO SERVICES THAT WILL ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE REDUCE WAIT TIMES. FOR ASSISTANCE AND DELIVER SERVICES IN THE WAYS CUSTOMER ONE THING IF YOU COULD. YES [inaudible] I'M SO. WE WE HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS THAT WE NEED TO GO AND DRESS THESE CHALLENGES ARE ONLINE APPOINTMENT SYSTEM IS ANOTHER AREA THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THOSE AND WORKING WITH OUR VENDOR. TO EXPAND SERVICES AND ALSO MANAGE THE BLOCKING OF APPOINTMENTS -- THE REAL ID IS THE MAJOR PRIORITY OF WHAT WE NEED TO ACHIEVE IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT AND OUR COMPLIANCE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY AGGRESSIVELY MARKET AND RAISE AWARENESS AND EDUCATION. WITH OUR CUSTOMERS SO THEY COME IN THE MOST PREPARED IT EVERYTHING INDICATES THAT WHEN A CUSTOMER COMES IN MOST PREPARED. THE PROCESSING TIME IS SO MUCH SHORTER THAN WHEN THEY DON'T WE HAVE HEARD THAT CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY THAT COMING PREPARE CAN GET IN AND OUT OF THAT TRANSACTION IN TEN MINUTES. SO THAT IS A GOAL WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY ADDRESSING BECAUSE THAT WE THAT MEANS WE CAN SEE MORE PEOPLE -- WE'VE ACTUALLY -- SELF PAY THANK YOU. AGAIN LET ME JUST REITERATE. WHY WERE HERE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR SPEECH -- ACTING DIRECTOR WEB. BUT IT SOUNDS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE SPEECH THAT WAS GIVEN TO US IN AUGUST -- IN TERMS OF MANY PROMISES THAT WERE MADE AND NOT FOR FILLED SO THE QUESTION IS IS. HOW DO WE ENSURE? THAT WHAT YOU SAID ACTUALLY GETS DONE SO I'M GONNA GIVE -- MISS CROCKETT A MINUTE AND MISS MARTIN AND MINUTE NOR MISTER CROCKETT. AND MINUTE EXCUSE ME -- AND LET'S GET TO MEMBER QUESTIONS. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN YOU DON'T YOU YOU COULD BE THE MOST POPULAR GUY IN THE ROOM NOT [inaudible] FINANCE. THANK YOU I'M IN MARIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE VERY BRIEFLY BY WAY OF BACKGROUND YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE SIX LAYS OUT THE FUNDING. REQUESTS HIS FOR THE FUNDING REQUEST THE FIRST VOTE FOR ROSE INCLUDING THE AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN REQUEST PRESENT PURSUANT TO PROVISION TO HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PROPOSAL WAS ORIGINALLY A FIVE YEAR PROPOSAL BUT THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDING THAT IMPLEMENTATION WAS JUST GETTING STARTED. THE ONLY APPROVED THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF FUNDING INTO SPRING THAT WE WOULD BE BACK IN NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE NOW. THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO SUBMITTED THEIR SONORA QUEST ON JANUARY THIRD THROUGH JAIL BC PROCESS AND BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF WE COMMITTED TO EXTENDING THAT REVIEW PERIOD. UNTIL WE COULD HAVE UNTIL YOU COULD HAVE A HEARING WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY -- IN KEEPING WITH THAT COMMITMENT WE HAVE RELEASED THE AUDIT. THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE STRIKE TEAMS WORK AND OUR SPRING PROPOSAL TO BE DISCUSSED LATER. AT LAST THAT WOULD JUST NOTE AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THE BUDGET ACTOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN REQUIRES DMV TO SUBMIT MONTHLY WAIT TIME REPORTS. THROUGH AT LEAST DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS ACT FOR THE OCTOBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE AND WE WILL CONTINUE. TO SUBMIT THOSE TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE APPRISED OF OUR PROGRESS THANK YOU THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THIS PETRIE-NORRIS. SEC I THINK. AT THE CHAIR RAISED I THINK SOME CONCERNS IN TERMS OF PROMISES THAT HAD BEEN MADE PREVIOUSLY AND AND NOT MET AND I THINK THERE'S A RESISTANCE AND IT JUST SORT OF POOR GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD AS THE CASE MIGHT BE. I'M I THINK YOU AS WELL LIKE KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO REBUILD KIND OF CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN THE DMV AND IN. THE DMV'S LEADERSHIP'S ABILITY TO ACTUALLY GET THINGS DONE ACTUALLY DELIVER ONE SUGGESTION I I WOULD HAVE IS I THINK A WAY TO REBUILD CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IS. BY SETTING YOU KNOW NEAR TERM CONCRETE DELIVERABLES AND MILESTONES AND I DO APPRECIATE. YOU SEEM TO HAVE A MORE EXPANSIVE AND AMBITIOUS AGENDA BUT I DO WHICH I DO APPRECIATE BUT I THINK WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL CERTAINLY FOR ME AND FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO SAY OKAY. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER IN THE NEXT YOU KNOW TWO MONTHS FOUR MONTHS SIX MONTHS. AND THEN AS WE HIT THOSE MILESTONES WE CAN ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDING I'M IS A IS IS THAT. APPROACH SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH AND BE WHAT ARE THOSE CONCRETE DELIVERABLES AND MILESTONES THAT THAT WE COULD LOOK FORWARD TO OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT. EIGHT TWO FOUR AND SIX MONTHS. I'M SO WE'RE GONNA ADDRESS A LOT OF THAT I THINK SECRETARY OF ACTUAL ADDRESS SOME OF THAT WITH OF OURS FOR WORK WITH THE GOV UP STRIKE TEAM. HEY THERE THE WAY I WOULD -- PROBABLY APPROACH THIS IS. ONE ALTERNATIVE SERVICE -- WE REALLY NEED TO MOVE FOR WITH OFFERING ALTERS SERVICES AND GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICE. SO THE EXPANSION OF CHAOS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MEASURE -- I BELIEVE ALSO THE EXPANSION OF ONLINE SERVICES AND IMPROVING OUR WEBSITE SOMETHING WE CAN MEASURE. I THINK THOSE ARE ARE TERRIBLE AND THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T ILLUSTRATED CAPABILITY AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS TO MEASURE THE TAKE UP RIGHT. I THINK YOU KNOW ARE THESE HITTING THE MARK FOR OUR CUSTOMERS DO WE SEE A TAKE OPERATE GOING ON WELL I THINK -- CHAIRMAN YOU BROUGHT UP SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS IMPORT TO ME IS WHAT ARE THOSE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE AT THE DMV. THAT MEASURE WERE ACHIEVING THE CUSTOMER GOALS THAT WE ARE SEEKING -- WE KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO PROCESS REAL ID WHICH REQUIRES IN PERSON HANDLING THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. FOR US TO ISSUE A REAL ID -- I NEED TO MOVE TRANSACTION THAT TRANSACTION SO THE FIELD OFFICE SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE THEY'RE GONNA BE COMING AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS -- IN FURTHER DETAIL BUT EARLY PROJECTIONS I WOULD SAY ARE WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE COMING IN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- BONO ON A MONTHLY BASIS ON A MONTHLY BASIS I WISH IT WAS ANNUAL. ON A MONTHLY BASIS THEY SHOULD BE COMING IN SO THE MORE THAT I CAN MOVE OUT -- AND ALLOW THE FIELD OFFICE TO HANDLE COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS OR REAL ID TRANSACTIONS. THE MORE TIME WILL HAVE FOR THOSE APPOINTMENTS SO LET'S MEASURE THAT I THINK THE OTHER THING IS CALL CENTERS I THINK WE NEED A MEASURE HOW QUICKLY WERE ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND SERVICE PEOPLE IN THE CALL CENTER. WERE LOOKING AT THE ABILITY TO HANDLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE CALL CENTER ENVIRONMENT -- IN OUR NEW CONTRACT WITH OUR VENDOR BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE WAITING AND IN IN A CALL CENTER ENVIRONMENT WHEN THEY NEED SOME IMMEDIATE ANSWERS -- SO AGAIN PROVIDING THOSE ALTERS COULD BE MEASURABLE AREAS AGAIN WHAT TO TAKE A BREAK. OUR CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY USING THESE TOOLS DOES THIS MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS NOT MEETING THEIR NEEDS THAT I SAY WE STOP USING IT. BUT PERMITS MARKETING THOSE TOOLS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE AVAILABLE I THINK AS I POINTED OUT. THESE ARE TOOLS ARE CUSTOMARILY AVAILABLE IN ANY KIND OF RETAIL ENVIRONMENT OR IF YOU GO ONLINE AND DO ANY KIND OF WORK WITH AN ONLINE. ENTITIES SO WHY NOT MAKE THESE AVAILABLE FOR DMV CUSTOMERS AS WELL -- FROM THE FIELD OFFICE STANDPOINT -- WE AGREE WITH YOU WERE LOOKING AT WAYS TO GO AHEAD AND DO BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT AND ALL OF OUR OFFICES. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAME UP IN MY MEETINGS WITH ALL OF YOU IS THOSE THAT ARE OFFICES THAT ARE HIGH PERFORMING -- WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES IN THOSE HIGH PERFORMING OFFICES THAT ACTUALLY COULD BE APPLIED ANOTHER OFFICES? THERE ARE SOME NUANCES THAT WE HAVE TO BE -- MINDFUL OF NOT EVERY OFFICE IS DESIGNED THE SAME WAY THEREFORE FLOW IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME -- THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE AWARE OF IS IN CERTAIN OFFICES -- THERE ARE CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT ARE -- CUSTOMERS WANT VERSUS OTHER PRODUCTS AND WE LOOK AT PRODUCT LINE BEING SERVICE BASED ON THOSE OFFICES IN THOSE CUSTOMERS -- BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE SOME SHOULD SEIZE I THINK THE THING I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT -- AND I THINK CAN GIVE US SOME MEASURABLE -- KEEP PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IS THE WORK WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING WITH MACKENZIE. AND THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW -- WE ANTICIPATE GETTING A REPORT FROM THEM -- BY MADE JUNE I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME OUTSTANDING RECOMMENDATIONS COMING FROM THEM -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THE OTHER THING WE'RE ASKING -- FROM ALL OF YOU. IS -- THE ABILITY TO EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS. AND AGAIN AS I SAID EARLIER PREPARE CUSTOMER MEANS IT'S A SHORTER EXPERIENCE AT THE DMV IF THEY COME IN FULLY PREPARED WITH ALL THEIR DOCUMENTS. IN HAND WE CAN PROCESS THEM VERY VERY QUICKLY WHICH MEANS I CAN ACTUALLY HAVE MORE PEOPLE COME INTO THE OFFICE FROM AN APPOINTMENT STANDPOINT. IF IT'S NOT A THIRTY MINUTE EXPERIENCE JUST IN FRONT OF A COUNTER IT'S A TEN MINUTE EXPERIENCE THE THINK ABOUT IN THAT SAME PERIOD TIME I CAN ACTUALLY TAKEN THREE MORE PEOPLE. MULTIPLY THAT BY ALL THE CUSTOMER COUNTERS THAT MEANS WE CAN START TAKING IN MORE PEOPLE SO. WE SAY ONE OF THOSE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS WE CAN PUT THOSE THINGS IN PLACE. WE NEED THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT -- THAT'S THE REQUEST FOR MAKING ALL OF YOU AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WE'VE GOT A SHORT TERM NEED THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. IN ISSUING READ REAL ID WHAT I'M ALSO -- THOUGHTFUL ABOUT AS A GOOD STEWARD. IS THAT AS WE GET THROUGH THIS IMMEDIATE NEED TO ISSUE A REAL ID WHAT ARE THE EFFICIENCIES THAT WERE GAINING AS WE GO FORWARD. AND HOW DO WE NEED TO STAFF THE DMB ON A GO FORWARD BASIS. AND THOSE OR SOMETHING I THINK WE OWE TO YOU AS WELL. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I'VE GOT SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS BUT I MIGHT SAVE THEM FOR THE SECRETARY'S FIVE PRESENTATION TO ON A STEEL. SEWER THUNDER. THIS IS A JUST A JUST A FALL PROGRAM MR FONG ON WHAT IS THE TAKE OPERATE FOR KIOSKS IN ONLINE AS OF NOW. I DON'THAVE THOSE NUMBERS ARE FROM MALE SEE IF MY COLLEAGUES DO BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU -- AT THE CHAOS AT THE DMV OFFICES HAVE STAYED ABOUT THE SAME. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I AM VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT IS. PUTTING KEY AWESOME DMV OFFICES MEANS I'M TAKING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE DMV OFFICE -- WHAT WE ARE FINDING AS WE PUT THEM OUT TO RETAIL OUTLETS OR TRIPLE A OFFICES THE TAKE UP RATE -- IN THOSE OFFICES ACTUALLY -- INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AND SO WE BELIEVE WITH GOOD MARKETING AND EDUCATION OF PEOPLE ABLE TO GOOGLE AND FIND WERE A KIOSK AS THEY CAN ACTUALLY PROBABLY SEE A HIGHER TAKE UP RIGHT. THE OTHER THING IS OUR VENDORS VERY GOOD AT LOOKING BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A KIOSK IF IT'S NOT GONNA GET TRAFFIC -- IS WORKING WITH THEM TO IDENTIFY GOOD RETAIL OUTLETS IN OUR TRIP WAY PARTNERS WHERE WE CAN BENEFICIALLY PUTTING KIOSK. TO TAKE UP THAT -- ACTIVITY SO WE HAVE A MARKETING PLAN FROM THE VENDOR -- TO LOOK AT THAT AND YOU GUYS [inaudible] YEAH. SO I'M SORRY GO IN A DIFFERENT YOUR PREFERENCE ON FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE SST THEIR SELF SERVICE TERMINALS WE PROCESS ABOUT. A HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS. AND INTERPRET WHAT A LOT OF OUT OF HIM WHAT KIND OF HAMMY KIOSK -- THAT WAS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND HE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND NO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO NOW IF I THINK ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY MONEY COME. TO TWENTY FIVE SMALL. ANDTHEN AND THEN -- FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN IT WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND I WAS AT A HUNDRED FIFTY TWO KIOSKS. AND AGAIN THOSE ARE WITH LIMITED SERVICES AND I'M RIGHT NOW CORRECT WITH EXPANDED SERVICES WE COULD SEE A TAKE OPERATE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO MONITOR. OKAY. AND THEN WHAT ABOUT ONLINE. ONLINE WE PROCESS ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILLION TRANSACTIONS A YEAR. AND HAS A CUT ON THE DOWN. OR DOWN CONTINUOUS TOOK TO CLIMB INTO THE CALL -- MAYBE CLIMBS ABOUT A MILLION A YEAR. BUT AGAIN WITH EXPANDED SERVICES WE CAN SEE THAT ACTUALLY GROW. CUT -- AND THEN JUST JUST A FINANCE -- DECIDE JUST WANNA HAVE THE STATED FOR THE RECORD THE THE BUDGET -- THE APPROXIMATE. BUDGET FOR THE AGENCY DMV'S ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS WITH -- ABOUT -- EIGHT THOUSAND FULL TIME FULL TIME EMPLOYEES ROUGHLY OR FOR THE THOUSAND PLEASE WITHOUT. ONE IF. PRIOR TO DISCUSS ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION AND A THOUSAND SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT. EIGHTY THREE SO THE REQUESTED. FOR TWO THOUSAND NEW POSITIONS IN -- FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS SO JUST ROUGHLY YOU'RE ASKING FOR A 25% INCREASE ON MONEY AND BODY. TWENTY AND ALSO A AND ALSO A 25% INCREASE ON STAFFING IS THAT ROUGHLY CORRECT [inaudible] SO. IN TERMS OF TOTAL TEMPORARY POSITIONS. TWO THOUSAND IS IS CORRECT WE ONLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT OF THOSE ARE PERMANENT POSITIONS BECAUSE WE ARE ANTICIPATING. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN TRAFFIC SO TWO THOUSAND TEMPORARY POSITIONS IS WHAT WE ESTIMATE BASED ON OUR ASSUMPTIONS. RELATED -- TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL BE COMING IN FOR A REAL ID AND THE DOLLARS THAT GO WITH THEM. SELECT THE TIME TO BE SAID TO BE ASKING FOR THREE YEARS -- HOW HOW MANY YEARS AGO ASKING FOR THE TEMPORARY POSITIONS? THE TWO THOUSAND IS THE HIGHEST OF ONE YEAR IS THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN AND THEN IT IT DROPS DOWN AS WE WOULD EXPECT THE WORKLOAD TO DROP DOWN THIS PROPOSAL -- FLUSHES OUT OUR SANCTIONS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OKAY THANK YOU MISS. FOR THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- I ECHO -- THE THE SENTIMENTS -- OF OF THE CHAIRMAN -- AND AND OF A SERVER. APACHE NORRIS. MY MY PATIENCE I DON'T I'D I GUESS I CAN SAY I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE ANYMORE WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. IT'S IRONIC TO ME AND I WAS TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE REPAIRS TODAY THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING. AT THE VERY DAY THAT. ACCORDING TO YOUR TWITTER ACCOUNT. DMV OFFICES WERE IMPACTED BY A CONNECTIVE ITTY ISSUE THIS MORNING FROM A HARDWARE FAILURE AT THE STATE DATA CENTER OPERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. SO YOU HAD A STATEWIDE FAILURE TODAY. SEKARANG. WE HAVE AN OUTAGE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED YOU SHOULD SHARE SOME SPECIFICS OF WHAT HAPPENED -- I WAS SHARING WITH YOU FROM A LAY PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS -- A SYSTEM -- AT CVG WHICH SUPPORTS -- THE DMV SYSTEMS BUT ALSO SUPPORTS OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL -- AND IT HAD A FAILURE WHICH THEN AFFECTED ALL OF OUR OFFICES BUT WE WERE ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND RESTORE FULLY TO OUR ALL OUR OFFICES I BELIEVE WAS GOING ABOUT. TEN O'CLOCK TEN THIRTY AND THEN WE HAD A FULL TRANSPARENCY AYE BECAUSE OUR OFFICE AT NOON AND IT WAS SOLD OUT. WHY CALL THE ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER I JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY TO SEE IF IT WAS A FUNCTION YES SO THEN WHAT I WAS GOING TO FALL OFF AND SAY IS THAT WE HAD A SUBSEQUENT -- FAILURE WITH ABOUT FIFTY OF OUR OFFICES AND AT THIS POINT TIME IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE RESTORING THOSE OFFICES WE HAD TO GO THROUGH A REBOOT. OF ARE AT A DMV A SYSTEM AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CALL NOW. HAVE A LOOK AT MY EMAILS YEP MAYOR STANDING AS THEY WOULD BE FUNCTIONAL AT THIS POINT IN TIME SO JUST SO THAT EVERYONE HERE UNDERSTANDS IN THE PUBLIC THEY WERE TOO OUTRAGEOUS TODAY YES [inaudible] OKAY -- IN A NOW I WANT TO DELVE INTO THIS THAT THIS SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES HAS WITH -- THE THE CALIFORNIA BERMAN TECHNOLOGY ON PAGE FOUR OF OF THE END OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OF IT OUTLINES -- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IMPACT ON THE FIELD OFFICES CUSTOMER EXPERIENCING YOU OUTLINED A NUMBER THERE'S OF COURSE OUTLINED IS IS A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH INSUFFICIENT NETWORK SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE -- WEAKNESSES IN EXISTING PRO DMB PROJECT PRIVATIZATION -- WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE? CALIFORNIA PART OF TECHNOLOGY WHO IS WHO ENDS UP BEING ACCOUNTABLE. IN THE END IN BETWEEN THAT RELATIONSHIP IS THAT IS. IS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ACCOUNTABLE WHEN SOMETHING GOES WHEN SOMETHING FAILS OR IS IT THE DMV -- WILL NOT SPEAK FOR CDT BUT WE ARE A CUSTOMER OF CD TEAM AND THEY HANDLE -- SOME OF OUR HARDWARE AND OUR TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT MECHANISMS -- SO WE DO HAVE A WHAT I CALL SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT WITH A CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH A FOR THOSE SERVICES -- AND SO THERE ARE PROGRAMMING THINGS THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE -- FOR AND THEN IT'S KIND OF OUR BACK UP SYSTEMS AND OUR IBM SYSTEMS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT WE HAVE A GREAT NEED TO ADDRESS -- THEY ARE I THINK OUR OUTAGES POINT OUT -- WE HAVE A VERY FRAGILE SYSTEM AT THE DMV -- AND IT AND IT'S AN OLD SYSTEM. SO WHEN THERE IS A WHEN THERE IS AN OUTAGE OR WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS LIKE TODAY -- WHO DOES THE CITY COMING FIX IT OR DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT GO AND FIX IT WALK ME THROUGH THE RELATIONSHIP ON WHAT HAPPENS? SO IT FOR THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION BECAUSE IT THE FAILURE OCCURRED WITH THE CVT SYSTEM. CITY WAS ACTUALLY STAFF WAS WORKING WITH REPAIRING THE SYSTEM WITH PROBABLY THE VENDOR I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY BUT PRESUME IT WAS WITH A VENDOR. TO GO AHEAD AND REPAIR OR REBUILD THAT SYSTEM THEY WERE THEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH OUR IT FOLKS WITH OF OURS WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO ON OUR SIDE. AND ALSO BE ABLE TO DRESS WHAT WE COULD FROM OUR SIDE BUT WHEN WE ISOLATED AND DID SOME ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THAT WAS THE FAILURE WAS ACTUALLY WITHIN A SYSTEM AT THE END AT C. D. T. -- ALL WE CAN DO THEN IS AND FORMER STAFF AND TRY TO GO AND HANDLE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE TO THE BEST WE CAN OUR OFFICES -- AND THEN WORK WITH THEM WITH REGARDS TO ANY KIND OF REVIEW WE HAVE TO DO OF OUR OWN SYSTEM. ON OUR SIDE SO THERE IS A SEQUENTIAL ACTIVITY THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AS WELL AND THEN TESTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN IT DOES COME UP WE HAVEN'T LOST ANYTHING AS WELL. SO THAT JUST SIMPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN WHO DO WE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. AND IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE. WHO IS OUR ULTIMATE RESPONSE WAS A CITY? YOU KNOW THAT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU -- IT WILL ONLY TWO ENTITIES YEAH I DISEASE THE IDEA OF THE AND THERE'S DIEM. AND THEN THERE IS INCREDIBLY OLD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT JUST CAN'T BE SUPPORTED ANYMORE -- WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS AN IBM SYSTEM THE IBM CAN'T SUPPORT ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO MIGRATE OVER TO AN UPDATED IBM SYSTEM AND I WILL TELL YOU IT'S NOT EVEN WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE BUT IT GETS US IN A MORE STABLE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE NEED TO BE. SO I CAN ALSO TELL YOU IT'S AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE HAVE. PRACTICE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON THIS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED SO THEN WHEN YOU ROLL THESE KIOSKS AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED AT THESE TABLETS THAT -- AT THE GERMAN TING TALKED ABOUT. THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE SUPPORTED BY THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. CORRECT THEY RECEIVE INFORMATION FED FROM OUR SYSTEMS THE THE KEY ALSO BASICALLY STALE SYSTEMS BUT THEY DO RECEIVE INTERFACE WITH OUR SYSTEM SO WE CAN PROCESS THE APPLICATION SO WHEN THE SYSTEMS GO DOWN. TO THESE KIOSKS TO WORK. THE CHAOS MINERS THEY ARE ALSO IMPACTED I THINK TRIPLE A WAS IMPACTED THE KIOSKS WERE IMPACTED. SO SO IT'S IT SEEMS TO ME THAN THAT. THAT'S THAT WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN EVERYTHING STOPS. AT THAT LEVEL YES. OKAY AND THEN SO WHO IS AN OLDER RESPONSIBLE DENT IT SO. AS A CUSTOMER CDT MARIJUANA PECAN CT BUT IT'S IT'S ON IT'S THAT NO CHOICE RIGHT. IS THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THESE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE IBM MAINFRAMES AND WHAT AND WHAT NOT. DO YOU GO TO SEE THE TùAND SAY WE WANT YOU TO PURCHASE AN UPGRADE AND AND AND AND AND EMPLOYMENT WHAT WE WANT OR DOES HE NEED TO COME TO YOU AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR YOU. AND THEN YOU SAY YEA OR NAY. SO THAT'S A JOINT EFFORT BECAUSE THERE IS OVERSIGHT THE CITY HAD CITY HAS FOR THE DMV -- BUT I ALSO WILL TELL YOU THE APPROACH THAT WE WANT TO TAKE THIS YEAR -- IS PUT IT OUT BECAUSE I THINK TECHNOLOGY -- TECHNOLOGY IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY RICH IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF PARTNERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT I THINK CAN ACTUALLY HELP US SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS DMV AND SO OUR GOAL IS TO REACH OUT. TO OUR TECHNOLOGY PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNER TO LOOK AT SOLVING THE TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM WITH DMV. AND SO OUR APPROACH -- IN THE FIRST THE FRONT AND SUSTAINABILITY IS TO TAKE THAT STRATEGIC APPROACH AND NOT TRY TO SOLVE IT OURSELVES. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH I THINK IS TO REACH OUT. TO OUR AGAIN ARE ARE RICH RICH TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT. HOW TO TRANSFORM THE DMV TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE THIS IS A TRANSFORMATION IT IS A FULL ON TRANSFORMATION? HOW DO WE TRANSFORM THE DMV SYSTEMS WHILE ALSO ENSURING THE PROTECTION OF REALLY CRITICAL DATA AND THE SECURITY OF THAT DATA AS WE TRANSFORM SURE? ARE YOU SAY THIS AND I I I DO WANT TO SPRING THIS ON YOU SO I APOLOGIZE BUT IT'S SOMETHING THEY THEY COMES UP BECAUSE THERE'S A CLEAR PATTERN. OF FAILURES HERE WHEN IT COMES TO AND IT MAY BE. MORE CITY THAN TO DMB SO I JUST WANT WILL THROW IT OUT THERE BUT SO YOU'VE GOT THE SMART TABLETS THAT ARE BEING ABLE MAY BE AT THE OUTAGES. TO OUTAGES THAT HAPPENED TODAY AND THEN THERE WAS A VERY CONCERNING INVESTIGATIVE STORY IN LA TIMES TODAY ABOUT THE MISMANAGEMENT OF THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM AND THE CONFUSION AND CHAOS THAT WAS EVIDENT AS IS ROLLING OUT. AND OF COURSE THE DMV AND AND C. T. WERE INVOLVED WITH THAT ALONG WITH THE SECTORS STATE. AND SO -- I GUESS THE CONCERN FOR ME IS THAT -- AS WE ROLL OUT THESE AYE IF THE I'VE AYE IF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE I. T. SYSTEM IS THE CORE PROBLEM. THEN AND YOU'RE ASKING. FOR TWO OR FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS ABOVE THE EXISTING BUDGET HOW MUCH OF THE TWO ONE FOUR TWO MILLION IS GOING TO NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND I. T. PRO. OR ARE PROVING THIS THIS -- IN FROM IT INFRASTRUCTURE. CHALLENGES THAT TURNED A ROBBIE TO THOSE NUMBERS FOR YOU. BUT TWO THINGS THAT I HOPE WILL GIVE YOU SOME ASSURANCE WAYS PULLING UP THE NUMBERS IS. I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO GIVE YOU INSURANCE THAT'S GOING TO SPEND APPROPRIATE PART OF ITS ESTABLISHING A VERY STRONG GOVERNANCE ¡UCTURE THAT LOOKS AT THE ENTERPRISE A MEASURES RISK. MEASURE STRATEGIC GOALS AND MEASURES PERFORMANCE THE OTHER PIECE THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO BRING IT CONSULTANT -- TO HELP WITH THAT IN PLACE IN A BET THAT INTO THE DMV ORGANIZATION. THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WANT TO BRING IN BECAUSE I DON'T THINK OUR STRENGTH IS IN THIS AREA AT DMV. IS PROJECT MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLE OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE GOING ON I WANT TO HAVE STRONG PROJECT MANAGEMENT THAT'S ACTUALLY REPORTING TO ME. AND THEN THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART BUT IF THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT IS AT C. T. AND C. T. IS THE ACTUAL. PROBLEM THEN WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY CREATE A PROBABLY MADE THE PROBLEM WORSE CORRECT CORRECT AND I'M NOT GOING THAT ROUTE I'M ACTUALLY GOING OUT WITH A CONTRACT TO BRING IN SOMEBODY OUTSIDE TO BE A PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE FOR ME A PARTING DIRECTLY TO THE WHY. DO WE HAVE THE CITY T.. WELL AND SUFFER I'M NOT SURE OF THAT THEIR STAFF TO ACTUALLY HANDLE THE VOLUME THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DMV AND I AGAIN I WOULD HAVE IS AND THIS IS A HEARING AS EASY AS I APOLOGIZE I'M JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND IF IF. IF YOU COULD THE NUMBER THAT THE NUMBERS SO YES SO WITHIN THE THE PROPOSAL WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO ITEMS THAT ARE SO SHOULD WITH LIFE IMPROVEMENT ONE IS. A PER I COULD REDUNDANCY WHICH IS WORKING THROUGH SPEAKING ABOUT FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND SO THAT'S AN ANNUAL COST WHAT THAT IS IS FOR OUR LARGER OFFICES GRADE THREE FOURS AND FIVES. SMALLER OPPOSITE R. GRADES ONE AND TWO SO THE GREAT BEFORE THE FIVE OFF THE TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL LINE COMING IN THE OFFICE SELECT ONE OF THE LINES COMING FROM C. T.. FOR WHAT EVERYTHING GOES DOWN THERE'S ANOTHER LINE THAT GOES INTO THAT OFFICE. THE FACT THAT OKAY TONS OF FOUR POINT SIX MILLION FOR THAT AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER THREE POINT ONE MILLION - FOR I KEY COMPONENTS AND IT'S REALLY AN ANNUAL REPLACEMENT -- AND THAT'S FOR SERVERS ROUTERS SWITCHES THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES AS THEY RELATE TO JUST FROM AT AN OUTDATED A REFRESH PROCESS. TO DO THAT SO THIS IS IMPORTANT PART POINT WHICH I THINK IT DOVETAILS INTO -- A WHAT IS A NUMBER THAT PETRIE-NORRIS SAYS THAT IF WE WANTED. MILESTONES AND METRICS SO WHAT HOW MUCH WOULD IT TAKE TO FIX. THE I. T. PROBLEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. NOTTHE PEACE MIL FOUR POINT SIX AND THREE POINT ONE MILLION WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO FIX THE PROBLEM. MAY YOU YOU SAID AND RIGHTFULLY SO IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE DMV OF THE FUTURE. RIGHT. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN APPROVING A BUDGET AUGMENTATION THAT DOESN'T FIX THE PROBLEM. SO WHAT FIXES THE PROBLEM. NOT MORE STAFF. BUT HOW IF INFRASTRUCTURE IS THAT THE KEY COMPONENT AND OF YOUR TWO THOUSAND STAFF MEMBERS CAN EVEN DO THE WORK BECAUSE THE I. T. SYSTEM FAILED. AND THEY'RE SITTING THERE DOING NOTHING AND THE GETTING YELLED AT BY CUSTOMERS RIGHTFULLY SO. HOW MUCH FIXES THE PROBLEM AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO FIX THE PROBLEM? SO ALL THAT ROBBIE SPEAK TO BUT I KNOW WE PUT TOGETHER A A FIVE YEAR PLAN -- ON ADDRESSING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS ENTITLED FRONT AND SUSTAINABILITY WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD SOME FURTHER STRATEGIC CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE MANNER WHICH WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD -- MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS INTO YOUR POINT AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SEE PUT IN PLACES ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURAL PLAN. THAT MOVES US INTO THE FUTURE. AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT PLAN RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAVE TO CREATE THE ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURAL PLAN THAT KNOWLEDGE IS ALL THE PRODUCT LINES THAT ARE SERVICE BY DMV. AND THEN THE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW DO WE TRANSITION FROM OUR AGING INFRASTRUCTURE TO A NEW -- SYSTEM THAT'S MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE NIMBLE AND AND ROBUST FOR OUR NEEDS -- THAT'S A FIVE YEAR PROJECT AND I THINK THE GOAL IS TO TAKE AN AGILE APPROACH THAT FOR THE FIRST THING IS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR SYSTEM BUT I WHENI SAID I WANT TO GO OUT WITH A PROBLEM STATEMENT. IS THAT HOW DO WE GO AHEAD AND SOLVE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE DMV TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT ACTUALLY MEETS OUR NEEDS ON A REGULAR BASIS TWENTY FOUR BY. SEVEN I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER I THINK I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT WE NEED A PLAN WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS PLAN FOR VERY LONG TIME I'M ONLY IN MY SECOND TERM AND I BELIEVE THAT MY PREDECESSORS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT PLAN AS WELL. SO. FROM I I'M NOT PICKING ON THE DMB I'M I'M FIVE MORE PICKING ON THAT FORMER TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK FOR US AS LEGISLATORS. AS LEGISLATOR WARS AS STEWARDS OF THE TAX DOLLAR WE HAVE TO SEE THE PLAN FIRST. AND SO I CAN'T WE MAKE DECISIONS I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE THE LAST HEARING I'M I'M REPEATING MYSELF BUT WE MAKE DECISIONS ON IMPERFECT INFORMATION. ALL OF US. TO AND WE KNOW ONE INCH ABOUT EVERYTHING AND SO PROVIDING US WITH ADDITIONAL INCHES OF INFORMATION IS CRITICAL. AND SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS ABOVE IT BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET YOU ALREADY HAVE. AND SO A YOU'VE AND ALL THE ALL THE RESULT ALL THE REVIEWS THAT OUTLINED THE SAME PROBLEM. AND YOU EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE SAME PROBLEM. AND AND SO IF IT'S I. T. IF IT'S CHAOS IF IT'S OUTSOURCING TO THE TRIPLE A OR EVERYTHING THAT ARE ALL THE THINGS WE THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS PLAN. THEN JUST TELL US THE PLAN. AND WE CAN EVALUATE WHAT THAT PLAN IS AND THEN WE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER WE SHOULD FUNDED AT THAT LEVEL. BUT IF YOU'RE PIECE MILLING IT AND ALL WE'RE DOING IS APPROVING TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE YEAR ON TOP OF THE BILLION DOLLARS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT DOESN'T FIX THE PROBLEM. WITHIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO YOU WHEN WE COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND WE'RE HAVING THIS EXACT SAME HEARING. AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IF THE PROBLEM IS TECHNOLOGY AND CD T. ISN'T DOING THEIR JOB. AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN YOU'RE GOING TO DO AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT WERE NOT EVEN GOING TO USE C. D. T. YOU'RE GONNA CREATE YOUR OWN SYSTEM WITH YOUR OWN I KEY PEOPLE THAT WE'VE CREATED MULTIPLE. AGENCIES AND MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENTS AND THAT SEEMS INEFFICIENT TO ME AND A WASTE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS SO I HOPE THAT. OVER TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND WORK THAT OUT IN TERMS OF WORKING OUT A LONG TERM PLAN AND IF THE GOAL AND WE ALL SHARE THIS GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A DMB OF THE FUTURE THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF THAT CUSTOMERS WILL. BE PROUD TO GO INTO OR NOT GO INTO AS WE HOPE THEY PROBABLY DON'T GO INTO NOW -- THAT WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT SO I I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION -- ABOUT I CAN I HOPE YOU CAN -- TELL THAT MY FRUSTRATION IS VERY HIGH [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU I KNOW -- MISTER COOPER IS TO LEAVE HIM TO LET HIM GO FIRST AND THEN TURN TO MISTER PATTERSON. I'LL JUST KEEP IT SHORT AND AN AWFUL OF MR FUNDS QUESTIONS REALLY THE BIG THING IS -- IN THE IT AYE AYE KNOWS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET YOU WANT -- SIX POINT TWO MILLION FOR SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED NEW PERSONAL COMPUTERS. FOR MOST IT PROGRAM YOU'RE VERY REPLACE REFRESH PROGRAM WHERE YOU GO ALONG IT REPLACED A FEW EVERY YEAR SO IT'S IT'S ONE BIG BANG. AND THAT REALLY GOES BACK TO FUNDAMENTALLY FOR THE FOR THE DMV THAT'S A BIG -- ONE ALL ALONG. YOU KNOW YOU STILL DO THE EFFORT IT BEFORE I KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT BUT DO NOT REFRESH REPLACE. AND AS FAR AS YOUR YOUR PROJECT MANAGERS GO PROJECT MANAGEMENT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENTIST. IT IS HOW THE PROJECT KEEPING ON TASK AND FOLLOWING IT SO I I KNOW YOU WANT TO GO OUT YOU MENTIONED BY GOING OUT DOING SME GOOD PROJECT MANAGERS. I THINK YOU HAVE THOSE FOLKS IN PLACE ALREADY THERE IN THE STATE EMPLOYMENT ALREADY. WHY ARE WE GONNA GO OUT ALREADY? AND YOU HAVE PROJECT MANAGER OVER SOME OF THESE PROJECTS. I'VE BEEN TOLD WITH THE REAL ID. AND WITH THE CUT THE OTHER I CAN'T THINK OF WHAT IT WAS. THE SIXTY OF THEM. YEAH MOTOR VOTER WILL NOT MOTOR VOTER THAT'S IT SO WAS THE SAME CHIEF. OVER THOSE BOTH PROJECT MANAGERS FOR THOSE PROJECTS. THE CHECKS AND SHE FROM YOUR AGENCY. I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA BUT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU FROM A STAFF STANDPOINT OR A TEA SHOP -- IS WE DO NEED TO MODERNIZE THAT OPERATION -- I'M ALSO FACE WAS SOME SUCCESSION PLANNING ISSUES THAT WAS NOTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AUDIT -- SO I NEED TO BE LOOKING AT WHO DO I NEED TO RECRUIT IN YOUR RIGHT PROJECT MANAGEMENT I CAN GO OUT AND RECRUIT. FOR BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT I HAVE AN IMMEDIATE NEED WITH A MULTITUDE OF PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW. WITH SOME STAFFING VACANCIES THAT I HAVE BUT I ALSO WANT TO GIVE SOME ASSURANCE -- TO THOSE WHO QUESTION OUR CAPABILITY TO DO THE JOB IS TO BRING SOMEBODY OUTSIDE TO DO THE JOB BUT I ALSO SEE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME POWERFUL KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER. I THINK OUR FOLKS NEED THAT SKILL SO ANY CONTRACT THAT I WOULD GO OUT WITH AND HAVE SOMEBODY COME IN AND DO PROJECT MANAGEMENT IS WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL. OF DEVELOPING MY STAFF AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER THAT THEY NEED TO DO THAT WORK. AND WE NEED TO PROBABLY RE EXAMINE HOW WE HANDLE PROJECTS AT DMV. THAT'S BEEN SOME OF CHALLENGES WE HAVE BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE FOR TV AGAIN BECAUSE OF OUR A LEGACY SYSTEM. WE DON'T GIVE OURSELVES ENOUGH TESTING TIME TO TEST SOMETHING BEFORE WE LAUNCH IT -- AND THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE WHEN WE'VE LOST SOME OF OUR PROJECTS TO SOME OF THE UNFORESEEN -- GLITCHES AND ROLLING OUT SOMETHING BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME OF VERY OLD ASSEMBLER KAULBACH COATS WE HAVE WITH THE DMV. SO YOU HAVE SOME THE OLDEST -- NETWORKING SYSTEMS COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. IS THAT CORRECT THERE IS MY UNDERSTANDING YES AND I KNOW YOU THE ACTING DIRECTOR RIGHT NOW HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WITH THE IN BEFORE. US SINCE FEBRUARY FIRST OKAY THE MINARET Là BUT A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN FOLKS COME AND GO BUT STILL YOU'RE YOU'RE MIDDLE MANAGEMENT THE CRUX THEY RUN THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS. THOSE FOLKS HAVE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT STRATEGIC GOALS THESE ARE GREAT WORD PHRASES AND AND CATCH PHRASES BUT ULTIMATELY COME DOWN TO LEADERSHIP DOING THAT IT. REALLY STARTS AND WITH ACCOUNTABILITY SO THE HARD PART IS WITH A LOT OF MONEY. AT DMV YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY MORE PERSONNEL IT'S REALLY HARD TO HAVE CONFIDENCE BECAUSE THERE'S A TRACK RECORD HERE GOING BACK ON THE BCP'S. AND AFTER THAT IT HAPPEN OVER MULTIPLE YEARS AND NOT MUCH IS JAMES GODDING IT'S GOTTEN WORSE I REALLY DO HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE. IN DMV RIGHT NOW TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WITH THAT IT EVEN JUST GOES A POINT THAT THE COMPUTER JUST BASICS. SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED COMPUTERS. YOU CHANGE COMPUTERS OVER HERE MAYBE A THOUSAND EVERY YEAR FIVE HUNDRED EVERY EVERY OTHER BUDGET CYCLE BUT TO CHANGE. ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND PETERS A ONE TIME. AT REALLY MAKES NO SENSE FOR SOMEONE HAVE A GOAL TO PUT THAT IN. WHERE WERE YOU? THE PAST FEW YEARS HE'S MAKING THIS RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS. I I T. IS NOT I MEAN FOR CERTAIN PARTS OF IT IS NOT REALLY THAT HARD. BUT THAT THAT'S JUST THE FRUSTRATING PART. AND I SEE THIS AND IT'S JUST WAS WASTING THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY. THAT'S BY THE MOST TROUBLING THING SITTING HERE -- TO TRY TO RECONCILE THAT NOTHING THE BROUGHT COMPLETELY HEARD ABOUT THE IN THE MY FIELD OFFICE WHICH IS IN SACRAMENTO ELK GROVE. NUMBER CAN PLAY FREEZE AGENCY IS ABOUT YOUR AGENCY. SELESAI THE WORD ONCE BEING IGNORED AMOUNT OF MY PURSE MIKE STAFF TIME ON THE IN THE ISSUES. AND YOU KNOW FOR FOLKS TO CALL AND THEY GOT THE PRETTY. PO. SELECT THAT YOU KNOW -- IN A LOT DON'T CALL AND SO TO ME THE PROBLEM IS MUCH MORE -- SIGNIFICANT THEN ON THE SURFACE SO. THAT'S THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY FOR NOW. THANK MISS COOPER MISTER PATTERSON. THEY JUST UP. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO REAL ID AND YOUR CUSTOMER WAIT TIMES AND WHEN I ASK A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THERE AND THEN LATER. WHEN THE SECRETARY AB THE BACHELOR IS HERE -- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE THAT THE ENVY OF THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. AND THEN JUST KIND OF SETTING THE STAGE HERE. I REALLY THINK WE HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM NOW. AND YET THERE I BELIEVE THERE IS A POTENTIAL IN A POSSIBILITY TO GET TO A D. M. V. OF THE FUTURE. BUT THE CHALLENGE YOU HAVE IT SEEMS TO ME IS YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF KEEPING A D. M. V. OPERATING WHILE YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU ENTIRELY RE ENGINEERING. SO UNLESS WE'RE WILLING TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO SHUT IT DOWN TODAY TURN IT OFF FOR AWHILE AND THEN FIX IT. I'M THAT'S NOT REALISTIC EITHER SO WE'VE GOT THE PROBLEM OF TODAY. BUT THEN I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY OF TOMORROW AND I WANT TO ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE BIT WITH. WITH THE SECRETARY AND I'M GONNA PREFACE IT WITH THIS WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. ON THE PLAN. WITH HOME. OF SILICON VALLEY. UP WE ARE -- THE STATE THAT HAS REALLY DEMONSTRATED WHAT. TECHNOLOGICAL AND AIDED CUSTOMER SERVICE REALLY LOOKS LIKE. FOR EXAMPLE AMAZON OR ANY OF THE OTHER LARGE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. ARE. AND SO I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL TALK ABOUT RIGHT HERE AND NOW. WITH A COUPLE OF ISSUES OF CONCERN. AND THEN LATER I WANNA EXT I WANT TO REALLY EXPLORE WHAT THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY DMV. CAN LOOK LIKE. I WANT TO SAY ALSO FROM THE OUTSET THAT I APPRECIATED YOUR VISIT WITH ME YESTERDAY. AND WE HAD SOME VERY YOU GOT DIRECT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM MORE ENCOURAGED NOW -- THAN I WAS WHEN THE GOVERNOR INITIATE THAT THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR INITIATED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A RATHER LATE AND SORT OF LACKLUSTER APPROACH TO THIS. WHAT WE DO HAVE NOW IS A GOVERNOR WHO IN MY ESTIMATION JUMPED OUT VERY EARLY ON THIS IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE? AND HE ARE FRANKLY A APPOINTED SOMEONE -- THAT I HAVE KNOWN -- AND HAVE WATCHED AND UP FOR SOMETIME. AND I AND I THINK THAT SECRETARY BATCH OR WAS IT WAS A GREAT CHOICE ON THIS. AND I THINK THE STRIKE FORCE REALLY DOES HAVE SOME REAL OPPORTUNITIES HERE. BUT THERE IS A BIG BIG CHASM BETWEEN WHERE WE ARE NOW AND WHERE WE HAVE GOT TO GET. TO AND SO I WANT TO JUST REMIND US THAT THIS IS THE THIS IS THE STATE THAT HAS LED. THE WORLD IN TECHNOLOGY AND YET WE HAVE A DMV THAT THE INSTITUTION THAT FACES MORE PEOPLE WITHOUT A ESSENTIALLY ALMOST A MONOPOLY ON THEIR SERVICE AND THEIR TIME. AND IT IS IN FACT. JUST IN. IT IS SPECIAL NOT WORKING -- AND WE ALL KNOW THAT WE WE WE WE'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT. YOU KNOW OUR BUT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PAST THE THE PATIENT'S SIDE. AND YEAH I REALLY THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A BIT OF A WAR A WORD OF WARNING HERE. THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. M. YOU CAN'T JUST CLOSE THE DMV DOWN. YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT PROBLEMS NOW WANT YOU YOU KNOW DECONSTRUCTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN DO. LIMITED FEW FUNDAMENTALS BUT THEN THERE IS THE NEXT QUESTION WHAT DOES THAT TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. D. M. V. LOOKS LIKE I THINK IF YOU CAN DO AMAZON LIKE TECHNOLOGY AND YOU CAN DEVELOP A A DMV THAT DOESN'T JUST HAVE. A YOU KNOW A REALLY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE DMV SERVE THE CUSTOMER NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. AND I'VE HEARD ALSO SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT DECENTRALIZING IT. ASKING YOUR PARTNERS TO DO MORE -- THE TRIPLE A IS A PER PERFECT EXAMPLE THERE LOTS OF OTHER WAYS THAT YOU CAN REDUCE THE WAIT TIMES. MOVE FOLKS -- TO TO OUTSIDE -- PLACES THAT'S MUCH MUCH MORE CONVENIENT AND ACTUALLY HELPS TO CUT THOSE WAIT TIMES DOWN BUT THE TWO THINGS I WANT TO JUST ASK DIRECTLY HERE. FROM -- SUCH A FROM MY RECOLLECTION THIS IS ABOUT REAL ID. THE DMV HAD A PLAN TO CORRECT ITS COMPLIANCE ISSUE BY APRIL FIRST. BUT APPARENTLY FAILED TO MEET ITS OWN DEADLINE. NOW. I GUESS THE THE DMV IS SAYING IT'S THE END OF THE MONTH. I'M MY CONCERN IS ARE YOU. COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL. REQUIREMENTS OR NOT IT SEEMS LIKE THE FEDERAL. THE AGENCY. IS SAYING OUR WHERE TESTING TO SEE THAT YOU'RE COMPLIANT WILL MAKE A DECISION AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE DMV IS SAYING WELL WE'RE COMPLIANT WE'RE WAITING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- TO APPROVE OUR COMPLIANCE MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU IN FACT REAL ID COMPLIANCE NOW OR ARE YOU IN DEFAULT OF COMPLIANCE AND ARE STILL WORKING ON A DEADLINE IN WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. SO IN THE COMPLIANCE BASE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WE RECEIVED OUR LETTER YESTERDAY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- THEY'VE EXTENDED OUR COMPLAINTS PERIOD TILL MAY TWENTY FOURTH -- TWENTY NINETEEN THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY SEE US IMPLEMENTS. THE CHANGE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING BOTH FOR WHAT I CALL KIND OF GO THE SECOND GENERATION OF GOING FORWARD WHICH IS REQUIRING TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS. WHERE THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT WE WAITED TO HEAR FROM HOMELESS CREE SO WE KNEW HOW TO IMPLEMENT -- THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION. WAS OUR FOLKS AND I REFER TO THEM AS OUR EARLY ADOPTERS WE ROLLED OUT -- THE REAL ID BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE WERE ONLY REQUIRING ONE RESIDENCY DOCUMENT. WE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED WHAT OTHER ANOTHER STATE HAD ACTUALLY DONE AND PUT THAT FORWARD AS OUR PLAN GOING FORWARD. WE LATER LEARNED FROM HOMELAND SECURITY THAT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS. SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ADDRESS ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THERE'S ABOUT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION AT THIS POINT. THAT -- HAVE THEIR REAL ID BUT SUBMITTED ONE RESIDENCY DOCUMENT -- WE PUT FORWARD A PLAN HOW TO GET THE SECOND RENTS THE DOCUMENT BECAUSE MY KEY GOAL WAS. NOT HAVING THOSE THREE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE COME BACK TO THE OFFICE. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT EITHER ONLINE OR BY MAIL. THE OFFICE OF HOMELAND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROVE THAT PLAN. WE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD THE TIMELINE IN WHICH TO GO AHEAD AND CLICK THE SECOND RUNS A DOCUMENT -- IN THEIR LETTER BACK TO US -- BASICALLY WE HAVE TO PASS THEY CAN COME IN ANY TIME NOW IF THEY WANT TO GO AHEAD AND ADD THEIR SECOND RAZZIE DOCUMENT. TO THE REAL IDEA WILL REFLECT OUR RECORDS OR AT THEIR SUBSEQUENT RENEWAL. THEY CAN COME IN WITH THEIR SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENT. SO OUR CONCERN WAS THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY ARE IN REQUIRES TO DO THAT ALSO BY OCTOBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY TO COLLECT ALL THE SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS THEIR LETTER TO A SAYS. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE REQUIREMENTS SO CAN HAPPEN OVER THE COURSE OF TIME UNTIL THEY RENEW THEIR ON THEIR CURRENT LICENSE -- AND THEN WE BASICALLY HAVE BEEN GOING FOR WITH THE SECOND RESIDENT DOCU WE BASICALLY DID A SOFT LAUNCH MANY OF OUR FOLKS OF APPLIED FOR REAL ID HAVE COME IN. WITH TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS -- I THINK ARE I BELIEVE OUR WEBSITE ALSO REFERS THEM TO BRING TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS SO WE HAVE ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE PROBABLY SINCE JANUARY THAT HAVE NOT BROUGHT INTO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS. BUT OFFICIALLY GOING APRIL GOING FOR APRIL TWENTY NINTH THEY MUST ACTUALLY PROVIDE AND PROVIDE TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS TO GO HEAD SECURE THEIR REAL ID THAT'S THE CHANGE THAT'S THE COMPLIANCE PIECE THAT WERE BEING HELD. TO BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY [inaudible] SO THE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEN THAT THE ANSWER IS YOU ARE PRESENTLY NON COMPLIANT. AS OF AS OF APRIL TWENTY NINTH WE WILL BE COMPLYING WITH HOMELAND SECURITY THEY WANT TO SEE IS IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THAT WILL BE THAT THE DATE WE'VE SAID WE WILL START OFFICIALLY. NO BUTS WILL OFFICIALLY BE ASKING FOR TOO RESIDENCIA DOCUMENTS [inaudible] AND WHEN YOU OFFICIALLY ASK FOR TO YOU ARE IN COMPLIANCE. THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THAT PART OF HOMELAND SECURITY THEY WILL ACTUALLY THEN. GET BACK WITH US BY HERE'S A BEFORE MAY TWENTY FOURTH OF TWENTY NINETEEN TO LET US KNOW FOR COMPLIANCE AT MY MY STANDING AS THE MAY TWENTY FOURTH IS THE EXTENDED PERIOD CORRECT -- IN -- EMAIL INFORMATION. YOU WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE. SIGNIFICANT INDIVIDUALS -- WHAT -- THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY. SORT OF WHISTLE BLOWERS INSIDE OPERATIONS AND WE ARE. WE HAVE INFORMATION AT THAT THE WE WE PAY SOME ATTENTION. TO ADD IN SOME EXCHANGES WITH THE SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT -- SIX SUGGESTS THIS AND AND IN AN EMAIL THAT THIS REVIEW PERIOD WILL AND NO LATER THAN MAY TWENTY FOURTH OF TWENTY NINETEEN ONCE CALIFORNIA MEETS ALL REAL ID REQUIREMENTS. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WILL APPROVE THE STATE AS FULLY COMPLIANT SO AS OF NOW WE ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE. COMPLIANCE AND THE ACTIVITIES THAT YOU ARE UNDERTAKING BETWEEN NOW AND MAY. TWENTY FOURTH. WE'LL BRING YOU INTO COMPLIANCE. AND SO CAN YOU SAY THAT WHAT YOU HAVE LAUNCHED. AND THAT WILL MEET THE TIMELINE. WILL RESULT BY OR EARLIER THAN MAY TWENTY FOURTH [inaudible] HOMELAND SECURITY'S -- CERTIFICATION THAT YOU ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE. OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INDICATE THAT THEY WILL GIVE US COMPLIANCE ONCE I SEE IS ROLLING OUT AS OF APRIL TWENTY NINTH -- THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE CONVEY TO US AND THAT -- WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING WILL ACTUALLY PUT US INTO COMPLIANCE YOU YOU REFERENCE THE THREE POINT SOME ODD MILLION -- I'M I'M SURE YOU HAVE SEEN THE SACRAMENTO BEE STORY ON THIS TODAY -- HI. AGAIN I WOULD I I REALLY HOPE THAT. THE PRESENTATIONS THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY THAT SOUND VERY MUCH LIKE TO PRESENTATIONS. WE WERE HEARING THAT BACK FORMALLY [inaudible] SOUNDS SIMILAR. AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING WITH RESPECT. TO THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND YOU SAY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THROUGH THE DOOR. WHAT HE SAID A DAY? MONTH A MONTH MONTH A MONTH THANK YOU [inaudible] THERE ARE. MY POINT IS THIS THAT ARE I REALLY THINK THE REAL ID IS IS IS. THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID HERE TO GET THIS RIGHT -- AND AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME DEADLINES HERE TO MEET. AND IF WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE IT IS INSUFFICIENT TO GET TO THE COMPLIANCE. WETHOUGHT OUR WEIGHT LINES AND OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE PROBLEMS IN THE DISTANCE APPOINTMENT WITHOUT -- CUSTOMERS AND AND CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA WAS BAD BACK THEN. WAIT UNTIL WE HIT A HARD LINE WHERE THEY HAVE BY. TWENTY TWENTY AND WE'VE GOT. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS SAYING ALL MY GOODNESS I GOT TO GET IN AND GET. SO IT DOESN'T IT BEHOOVE YOU TO GET COMPLIANCE. AS SOON AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN AND CAN YOU ASSURE US THAT COMPLIANCE WILL BE MET BY THIS DEADLINE. SO FROM A COMPLIANCE STANDPOINT AS FAR AS REQUIRING TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS YES ABSOLUTELY WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THAT. THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE WITH REAL ID IS THE FACT THAT IT'S ALSO NOT MANDATORY IT'S VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE. AND WHILE WE CAN FORECAST THE ONGOING ANNUAL RENEWAL OF DRIVERS LICENSE AND IDEAS THAT COME UP WE CAN FORECAST THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE I THINK ARE FORECAST IS ABOUT 75% OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL OPT. FOR HAVE A REAL ID -- WHETHER AS A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR AN ID CARD BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A PASSPORT OR SOME OTHER APPROVED DOCUMENT PASSPORT WITH A DRIVER'S LICENSE WILL ALLOW YOU TO BOARD A PLANE -- THE UNCERTAIN TODAY IS REALLY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NEED REAL ID AND WANT REALITY AND THAT'S THE UNKNOWN PIECES HOW MANY PEOPLE IN ADVANCE OF THEIR REGULAR RENEWAL CYCLE. WILL WANT TO COME INTO THE OFFICE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO OPT IN TO GET REAL ID BEFORE THEIR RENEWAL IS DUE. THAT'S A BIT OF A GUESSING GAME WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER STATES AND LOOKING AT THE TAKE OPERATE. THAT THEY'RE SEEING AGAIN HOW CAN WE SHARE BEST PRACTICES WHAT ARE WE LEARNING DO WE NEED TO ACTUALLY FORECAST AT A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. TO YOUR POINT I WISH I HAD A CRYSTAL BALL HAD MORE CERTAINTY WITH EXACTLY THE VOLUME WE ARE. GIVING OUR BEST ESTIMATE ON WHAT WE THINK IS GOING TO BE THE TAKE OPERATE NOT ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE RENEWALS BUT PEOPLE WHO MAYBE WILL COME IN ADVANCE OF THEIR RENEWAL. BUT COMPLIANCE IS REALLY FROM AN INDIVIDUAL STANDPOINT WE WILL BE A COMPLIANCE BECAUSE WE FIND WE HAVE A PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND GET REAL ID IF THEY WANT A REAL ID. THEY CAN COME IN AND GET IT THE QUESTION IS WHEN THEY SHOW UP IN AN AIRPORT AND THEY WANT TO FLY. DO THEY HAVE ALL THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION AS A CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT. ONE FINAL QUESTION IN THIS AREA. HAD HAVE YOU HAD ASSURANCES THAT THE THAT THE REAL ID FORMAT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND IT PHYSICAL WHEN YOU HAVE IT. IS THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YES THAT IS -- ONE OTHER POINT HERE WITH RESPECT TO CUSTOMER WAIT TIMES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. TROUBLED ME ABOUT THE WHAT IT. WAS THE AT THE APPARENT -- LACK OF CANDOR AND FRANKLY I'M I'M NOT. I'M NOT I DON'T WANNA SAY THE THE WASN'T TELLING THE TRUTH BUT IT SURE FELT LIKE IT WHEN IT COMES TO TRACKING THE TIME A CUSTOMER WAITS IN LINE BEFORE THEY ARE CHECKED IN. AND SO IF YOU GO ON THE WEBSITE THE WEBSITE REPRESENTS A CERTAIN WEIGHT TIME. AND THE AUDIT DETERMINED. I THINK THAT THAT WAS NOT ACCURATE -- I ASKED FORMER DIRECTOR SHE MOTOR ABOUT THIS THE LAST TIME SHE WAS HERE. AND SHE WAS SHE INSISTED THAT THE DMV WAS WORKING ON WAYS TO TRACK THE COMPLETE DIRECTION. THE DURATION OF WAIT TIMES. AND AS OF THE AUDIT THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE AUDIT MENTIONS THAT THIS AS WELL. OF THAT THIS THIS. PRE Q. ISSUE -- SO BASICALLY -- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO WAIT OR NOT IN A LINE TO GET TO TAKE YOUR ICKET. SEEMS LIKE THE WHAT THE DMV IS DONNA SAID THAT'S THE WAIT TIME WHEN YOU TAKE THE TICKET. NOBODY SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND OR WANT TO REPORT. THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA END UP SITTING IN IN IN A WAIT TIME IN IN A LINE THAT IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE TIME IT TAKES YOU TO GET THE TICKET. AND TO GET TO THE WINDOW -- CAN YOU ASSURE US THAT. THE WAIT TIME INFORMATION WILL BE PRECISE AND ACCURATE AND REPRESENT THE REAL WAIT TIME -- THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO INDOOR. I MUST TELL YOU THAT. MOST PEOPLE WHO CONTACT US ABOUT THE DMB AND IT'S BEEN A LOT OVER THIS. THESE LAST THREE YEARS -- THEY TAKE IT THE TRUST FACTOR IN THE BELIEVABILITY OF THE DMB IS IS JUST THAT SHREDDED. AND PART OF IT IS THAT. YOU CAN'T TRUST. WHAT SHOWS UP ON THE DMV WEBSITE TO BE ACTUAL PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU GOT AN HOUR WAIT? AND THERE AND THEY GO IN AND THEY WAIT AN HOUR AND A HALF OR TWO OR YOU HAVE A HALF HOUR WAIT TIME AND IT'S ACTUALLY AN HOUR AN HOUR AND A HALF -- SO CAN'T IT WILL THE DATA AND THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PUT ON THE WEBSITE THAT SAYS TO PEOPLE. YOU'RE GONNA EXPECT THIS AT FRESNO WE'RE GONNA EXPECTED SHIP SACRAMENTO AND THAT IT WILL BE AN APPROPRIATE CALCULATION FROM THE TIME THAT THEY GET IN THE FRONT DOOR. WAIT THROUGH THE LINE TO GET THE TICKET. PULL THE TICKET AND THEN GET TO THE WINDOW. SO I'M GONNA TURN THIS OVER TO COLLEEN BUT I WANT -- TO CLARIFY THAT WE HAVE A METHODOLOGY AND ALL HAVE CALLING SPEAK TO THAT METHODOLOGY. BUT WE ALSO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT METHODOLOGY TO ENSURE ACCURACY I THINK YOUR POINT WE NEED TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT WHEN THEY GO TO ONE OFFICE WHAT IS THAT WAIT GOING TO BE. AND SO WITH THAT CALLING YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE CURRENTLY MEASURING NOT SURE SO I'M A CURRENTLY YOU CAN HEAR ME I'M CURRENTLY AND AS YOU STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON IT IS IT'S A MANUAL TRACKING SYSTEM. SO THE TOPIC EACH OUR VERY A CAN SHE WENT. IT IS THE LATTER PART TYPE -- AVENUE TAKE THAT CARD AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR WE GIVE IT WE RECORDED AND IT SAN MANUEL TRACKING. AND I SHARE YOUR CONCERN AS WELL THAT WHAT YOU SEE ON THE WEBSITE TRULY IS THE ONLY REFLECTIVE OF THE TIME A TICKET IS ISSUED AND TELL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. AND OVER THESE LAST COUPLE MONTHS WE'VE REALLY BEEN EXPLORING WAYS THAT WE CAN TRACK THE TOTAL CUSTOMER JOURNEY. EVERYTHING CANNOT MEET AGAIN HI MEDI WE HAVE AN OFFICE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- ARE CARMICHAEL OFFICE THAT HAS MOBILE WORKSTATIONS BOTH MOBILE WORKSTATIONS HAVE THE TABLET ON THE ARBITRON FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD. AND AS THE CUSTOMER COMES IN THERE IMMEDIATELY AND TURNED INTO THE QUEUE AND THEN THEY HAD ONTO THEIR DL NEXT STEPS AND THEN BE OUR NEXT STEP. THAT MOBILE WORKSTATION HAS THE ABILITY IT CHARGES OVERNIGHT HAS THE ABILITY TO GO OUT FIGHT AS WELL. MIKE WAS UNIQUE OFFICES HAVE REPEATERS AND IT IS SIGNAL GOES OUT WE HAVE OTHER OFFICES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE ALSO KILEY MISSED. AND REALLY IT IS ON AND IT'S CONTINGENT UPON THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SINGLE REACH OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING SO WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE IT SO WHAT YOU SEE FOR CARMICHAEL IS TRULY REFLECTIVE YOUR ENTIRE CUSTOMER DIRTY. IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT YEAH WITH THE A SUGGESTION YEAH. YOU HAVE A METHODOLOGY THAT IS -- AT THE BEST ON CLEAR AND POSSIBLY EVEN A BIT. DECEIVING. IT'S NOT ACCURATE. WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING ON THE WEBSITE PAGE THAT SAYS THIS IS AN ESTIMATE YOU MAY? END UP WAITING -- YOU KNOW A LOT LONGER DO YOU DO THAT. PRESENTLY DO YOU WARN THEM. THAT THIS IS A GAS. IT COULD BE WORSE. IT OUT OF IF YOU IF YOU SHOW UP SOMETHING THAT BASICALLY TELLS FOLKS WE UNDERSTAND AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO OUR BEST. BUT WHEN YOU TELL THEM ONE THING AND THEN THEIR EXPERIENCE IS SOMETHING ELSE AND YOU DON'T GIVE THEM THE KIND OF WARNING THAT EVERY RETAILER EVERY. TECHNOLOGY OPERATION. YOU SEE IT ON ADVERTISEMENTS RIGHT THE THE THE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ADVERTISEMENT I RESULTS MAY VERY. THIS IS A REAL WORLD OF REAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH REAL PEOPLE I'M HOPING THAT. YOUR COMMUNICATIONS. WILL WILL NOT TRUST ITSELF IN A IN A IN A FORMULA. THAT IS MISLEADING AND THAT YOU CLEARLY LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT THAT'S WHY THEY'RE COMING TO THE WEBSITE. NOW I APPRECIATE THAT SUGGESTION IT DOES INDICATE ON OUR WEBSITE IT PROBABLY COULD BE A LOT MORE PREDOMINANT A LOT MORE. OUT THERE IN VISIBLE THAT DAY. THE TIME IT'S REFLECT ON THE INTERNET IS REFLECTIVE OF THE TICKET. ENTIRE TRANSACTION IT DOES NOT INDICATE THE FREAKY TIME BUT AGREED WE CAN DO A FAR BETTER TIME. YES AND IN THAT WAY WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT WAIT TIMES COULD POSSIBLY BE LONGER WE DO NOT. IN. NINETEEN THANK YOU FOR THE SUGGESTION. MR FRAZIER HAD ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO MISTER BROWN WHEN I'M GONNA. ASK. QUESTION BETWEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THIS THIS ON AND AND AGAIN YOU KNOW PLEASE TAKE THIS IS CONSTRUCTIVE -- DIALOGUE -- WE TALKED IN THE PAST IN THE LEGISLATURE'S AND I AND I BEG YOUR PARDON IF THIS IS BEEN ASKED AND ANSWERED I DO OVER TO HUMAN Và. HOA SERVICES TO TESTIFY BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE QUITE A WORKLOAD FOR THE DMV OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. CAN YOU. SHARE HAS IT ADEQUATELY BEEN FUNDED. WITH WHAT THE LIKE AB. SIXTY A MOTOR VOTER AB NINETY THREE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE CONTINUALLY PILE UP. AND THEN. US GOING WELL. WE TOLD YOU. HELLO CAN YOU SHARE WITH ME THE ADDITIONAL. THINGS THAT WE'VE ASKED YOU TO DO HAS IT BEEN -- FUNDED IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY. NOT ONLY FUNNY BUT THE MANPOWER THAT IT WAS REQUIRING. AN WHERE YOU JUST TAKEN IT ALL ON IN JUST. AS AN ORGANIZATION IN SAINT LEGISLATURE WANTS US TO DO THIS WE'RE GONNA DO THE BEST WE CAN. SO I'M GONNA -- HAVE ROBBIE PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE BUT LET ME SHARE WITH YOU MY OBSERVATION AND THE TWO AND A HALF MONTHS I'VE BEEN A TEAM MADE. I THINK THERE IS A BIT OF A GOOD SOLDIER -- ATTITUDE THAT THEY THEY JUST PRESUME THERE IS WHEN THEY'RE ASKED TO DO THINGS THEY DO IT BUT WHAT IT DOES ALSO IS -- BECAUSE A RE PRIVATIZATION OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE -- I KNOW THAT SOMEONE MEMBER COOPER BROUGHT UP -- THE REFRESH AND YOU'RE RIGHT IN ANY OTHER DEPARTMENT I WOULD SEE REFRESHES A NORMAL ACTIVITY. BUT NOT WHEN YOU'RE ABSORBING COSTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY. NOT FACTORED INTO YOUR BUDGET THEN IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THOSE COSTS THAN SOMETHING ELSE HAS TO GO IN THE DMV IS BEEN FACED. WITH THOSE CHALLENGES WITH THE CARS THERE BUDGET -- WITH REGARDS -- TO PROBABLY THE HISTORY WE RAN -- KIND OF A TALLY OF THE NUMBER OF BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN THE LATE LAST EIGHT YEARS THAT -- REQUIRED DMV TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY -- ADDRESS PRO RING PROGRAMMING CHANGES WITHIN ARE VERY FRAGILE TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENT. AND THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLS. THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRING THE DMV TO DO SOMETHING WITH REGARDS TO ITS PROGRAMS AND PRODUCTS THAT IT'S SERVICES. NOW MOTOR VOTER WHICH I'VE BECOME VERY ACQUAINTED WITH IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I AM INSTITUTING RIGHT NOW AT DMV BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET MOTOR VOTER RIGHT. AND I HAVE TO STAFF IT CORRECTLY -- IT'S BEEN TREATED BASICALLY AS A PROJECT. AND WHAT I MOVING FOR THIS ESTABLISHING A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND THEN I'M INSURING THAT I GET THE DATA. THE DOCUMENTS THE F. T. E.'S REQUIRED TO RUN A MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM AND IN THE MANNER WHICH WERE DELIVERING IT RIGHT NOW. AT DMV WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE PROCESSES BECAUSE WHEN I COME BEFORE YOU IF THERE'S A A RESOURCE REQUEST WE HAVE TO PRESENT TO YOU. MAYBE NEXT YEAR WE'LL SEE BUT I WANT TO COME IN WITH FULL JUSTIFICATION OF WHAT THE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR DMV. TO HANDLE MOTOR VOTER AND I DON'T KNOW THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN DONE AT DMV I'M NOT SENSING THAT HERE IS THAT LEVEL OF ASSESSMENT. TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT WHAT DOES THAT REQUIRE. SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A PROGRAMMING CHANGE BUT OUR PROGRAMMING PROGRAMMING CHANGE OF DMV ON ITS IT SYSTEM IS ANYTHING BUT EASY -- AND AGAIN I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK AND RE EXAMINE. AND WHAT I WOULD ASK IS YOUR CONSIDERATION IN ANYTHING YOU TASK AS WITH FURTHER. IT REALLY IS AN EMERGENCY GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM THE ORGANIZATION BEFORE YOU ASK US TO DO MORE PROGRAM CHANGES TO A SYSTEM THAT'S JUST. NOT EQUIPPED TO DO IT. BUT I ASKED THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE SEVERAL BILLS IN MY COMMITTEE THAT AIM. OF CONTEMPLATING HOLDING BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPACTFUL ON THE DMV AND TRYING TO ALLOW THE STRIKE FORCE TO BE PROACTIVE AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON BEFORE WE PASSED MORE BILLS. AND CREATE MORE OWNERS -- TEST FOR YOU. BUT I WILL TELL YOU SOME OF THESE TASKS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN ON MAY HAVE. IN A BURDEN IN SOME WAYS A FORM BUT LIKE A. B. NINETY THREE THE VETERANS DESIGNATION. RIGHT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO VETERANS BENEFITS -- WITH THE SP ONE IN THE PROGRAM CHANGES THAT YOU HAD TO DO WITH THE REGISTRATION. YOU KNOW THE TOTAL PROCESSES OF FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OUT AND TRANSPORTATION SO. THERE IS A MULTIPLIER SOMETIMES YOU BEAR THE BRUNT. BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S OTHERS THE BENEFIT. AND I NEED EVERYBODY TO RICK RECOGNIZE THAT GOING FOR IT'S A BIRD THAT BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE SOMETIMES YOU. LOSE A LITTLE HERE BEGIN A LOT HERE THANK YOU. ONE QUICK QUESTION -- YOU MENTIONED THE PILOTING THE CARMICHAEL REGARDING. THE TRACKING THE WAY TIME SO SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS. WE WERE HERE IN AUGUST -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN AUGUST IT IS NOW. SEVEN MONTHS LATER AND IN SEVEN MONTHS THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN THE PILOT THIS IN ONE OFFICE. SO WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE TO DO THIS AND EVERY SINGLE OFFICE. AND HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE. THANK YOU SO PART OF THE NEED FOR THAT WITH PART OF THE JAIL BC ASK AS EARLY FOR FOR FUNDING. IN SEOUL AND REGARDS TO WHAT CALLING WAS MENTIONED IN REGARDS THE REPEATERS IS A LOT OF THE OFFICES DON'T HAVE THE THE WIFI JUST LIKE AT YOUR HOME. AS LIKE TO EXTEND THE OUTSIDE THE OFFICES IN ORDER TO TO DO THAT. AND WE EITHER WE NEED TO PURCHASE THE REPEATERS HOW WHICH TO THE WALL FROM THAT THE CONTRACT IN PERSPECTIVE. AM AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO WORK WITH THE OFFICES IF THEY ARE LEAST OFFICES WE'VE GOT TO WORK WITH THE LESSORS. AND SO AT THIS POINT IT'S WORKING VERY SUCCESSFUL AT THE RELEASED THE CARMICHAEL WE PLAN TO THERE'S ABOUT NINETY OFFICES THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO INSTALL THOSE REPEATERS THAT -- AND THEN WILL CONTINUE TO ROLL IT OUT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE THE THE TIME LINE I'LL HAVE -- TO TO FORGET TO CALLING AS ARE LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S WHEN THE REASON THAT THEY RELATE TO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT BEFORE IT WAS A CONCEPT AND THEN IT BECAME PART OF THE JAIL BC ASK. AND THEN WE DID THE THE CONTRACTING PROCESS FOR THE REPEATERS THEM ABOUT INSTALL THEM AND IN THE PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD. BUDGET BUT ALSO THE CHARACTER SO IN SEVEN MONTHS. THE DEPARTMENT COULD ONLY INSTALL ONE YOU CALL THAT A REPEATER. IT IS A REPAIR HELPS TO AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL SENATE CAN GO OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING RIGHT THREE FIVE MUCH OF IT ONLY STOLE. ONE YES THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE THUS FAR AND WORKING VERY VALUE IN YOUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE IS ROBBIE INDICATED WE HAVE A PLAN BE FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT HAVE. THE HIGHEST PEAK HE WAIT TIMES. YOU KNOW AS WE ALL WHEN THE NOMINEE. YES A QUESTION SO WHAT WHY IS THAT YOU COULD ONLY INSTALL ONE IN SEVEN MONTHS. AT AT THIS PACE THEN YOU KNOW TO BE LIKE THIRTY YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN INSTALL. INSTALL THE REST EVERY DEPARTMENT HAVE THE REST OF THESE. ONE OF THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OR WAS IT FOR OR WAS IT JUST NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE IT WAS A PRIORITY FOR US NO IT WITH THE PARTY BUT IT ONE OF THINGS IS THE POWER TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS WITH I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND AND DO. SOME INSTALLED ON ALL THE OFFICES AND FIND OUT THAT IT'S NOT OKAY FOR DR YOU KNOW WORKS HOW IS IT TO TO DO THE REST OFFICE. AND SO DO WE HAVE THE SCHEDULE. YEAH WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE FINAL SCHEDULE. OKAY SO THEN WHEN WHEN. YOU COME BACK FOR APPROPRIATION WE'RE GONNA THE SAME ANSWER. THAT WASN'T WHAT WE NEED TO SCHEDULE I KNOW A LOT OF IN REGARDS TO OUR LEAST OFFICES IT TAKES ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE MONTHS OF THEIR LIVES TO WORKING WITH THE LESSOR. BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A CONTRACTED OUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE STATE DOES IN THE STATE OWNED FACILITY THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO OURSELVES THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST A COLUMN AYE AYE I APOLOGIZE TO MR BROKE THAT YOU KNOW -- IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF URGENCY TO THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US AND AGAIN. IT THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN SHE'S COMPLETELY BIPARTISAN BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING HAMMERED BY ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR PHONES ARE LIGHTEN UP AT HOME. IF THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME BETWEEN NOW. IN THE MIDDLE JIM. SO MISTER BROWN. THE APOLOGIZE ALMOST JAPANESE ARE VERY VALUABLE QUESTIONS. I JUST WANNA MAKE COMMENT OFF THE LINE OF QUESTIONING FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU'RE A REAL ID PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T GET ON PLANES THEY REALIZE THE TO COME TO YOU IN YOUR OFFICE IS GOING TO BE FLOODED. I WANT TO DELVE DOWN INTO THE SELF SERVICE KIOSK -- PROGRAM. IN THE LAST BUDGET WE ALLOCATED EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR YOU CAN YOU -- GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON HOW MANY WERE BOUGHT WHAT SITE SELECTION PROCESSES. SO WHAT THE F. AS THE PROGRAM -- WE DON'T PAY FOR THE ACTUAL AT THIS PLEASE WELL I'M AT THE PER TRANSACTION COST. AND SO WE WORK WITH THE VENDOR AS IT RELATES TO PUSHING THEM OUT INTO IN THE RETAIL SO NOW WE HAVE THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO PRIOR TO THAT WE WERE I'M RIGHT AROUND A HUNDRED SO WE EXPANDED OUT THE NUMBER OF ETHNICITIES. SO WE WORK WITH THE VENDOR AND ACTUALLY FOR THE EXTERNAL ONES THE BIG PUSH FOR THE DEPARTMENT. IS -- TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EXTERNAL AT FIFTY THAT WE HAVE SO THAT WE WE DON'T HAVE INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY GOING INTO THE OFFICE PICKING UP A PARKING SPOT WALKING IN THE LOBBY. AND SO. THE BIG PUSH AND AND THE DIRECTION HAS BEEN AS IS TRY TO GET AS MANY EXTERNAL AT FIFTIES AS POSSIBLE OUT THERE -- AND SO WE HAVE AN INCREASE THAT THAT BAND WITH -- IN THE VENDOR CHARGES -- THAT'S THREE NINETY FIVE PER TRANSACTION. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE VENDOR THE GOAL IS IN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE THE STRIKE TEAM IS THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY EXPAND THE THE NUMBER OF AT THIS SEASON AND ACTUALLY DO ANOTHER -- TWO HUNDRED THE WITH THE GOAL OF DOING ANOTHER HUNDRED THIS SUMMER AND ANOTHER HUNDRED BY THE END OF THE FISCAL OR THE CALENDAR YEAR. OKAY SO RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THAT'S BASICALLY THREE PER COUNTY. IF YOU SPENT ABOUT AN HOUR THEY ALLOCATED LIKE THAT OR HOW THEY ALLOCATE OUR HUNDRED I'M GO TO LA FIFTY I'M GO TO SAN FRANCISCO. I DON'T KNOW THE ALLOCATE SOMETIME AND I KNOW IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN AT THIS TI -- LOCATOR I DON'T KNOW THE LOCATION OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD OKAY. WE'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY THE SHIPPING AND FREIGHT INDUSTRY THAT THE SAY THERE'S A TREMENDOUS BACKLOG AND CARRIER PERMIT APPLICATIONS. CAN YOU DISCUSS THAT. SO -- I KNOW THERE WAS AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP AND I I SPOKE WITH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF PATTERSON ABOUT THAT AS WELL THERE WAS -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WAS A PROGRAM -- GLITCH FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM IN THAT SYSTEM AGAIN THAT'S KIND OF A A PRODUCT LINE SYSTEM -- IT WAS ON BOTH THE PROGRAM SIDE AS WELL AS THE I. T. SIDE THE SAID NOTHING TO DO WITH CDG IS MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT ISSUE WAS ADDRESSED AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE DON'T HAVE ANY OUTSTANDING PERMITS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROCESS RIGHT NOW. NOW THAT BEING SAID -- WE CERTAINLY HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE ASSOCIATIONS THAT WE COMMUNICATE WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS TO IDENTIFY ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES. THAT THEY PLEASE STILL EXIST AND I KNOW ONE OF THE ASSOCIATIONS THAT EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS AND SPOKE TO SOMEONE MEMBER PATTERSON ABOUT THAT AS WELL IS THE A TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION SO I'VE ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO THEM AND WE WILL HAVE A MEET AND GREET AND FIND OUT IF. THERE'S ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO RESOLVE FOR THEM OKAY SO IF IF SOMEONE CAN'T GET IN BECAUSE OF AN APPOINTMENT. LACK OF AN APPOINTMENT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PENALIZE THEM. I HAVE NOT EXPIRED LICENSE -- SO SO FROM THE STANDPOINT. THERE ARE ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH AND WE TRY TO GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS THE NOTHING NOTICE TO HANDLE THEIR RENEWALS IN AN APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY WAY. AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE THAT RELIES ON THE ON THE DAY THAT IT'S EXPIRING THAT THEY NEED TO GET INTO AN OFFICE WHICH IS WHY WE ACTUALLY MAINTAIN. THE NOT APPOINTMENT LINES IN OUR DMV OFFICES IN OUR OTHER BUSINESS CENTERS -- SO TO THE EXTENT WE TRY TO GO HEAD PROCESS THOSE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN WHEN THEY COME IN WHEN THEY SUDDENLY REALIZE THEY HAVE AN EXPIRING -- LICENSE OR REGISTRATION WE TRY TO HANDLE THAT BUT I DO WANNA -- VISIT WITH THE THE TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION OTHERS TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE THE REAL CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY STREAMLINED PROCESSES FOR THESE FOLKS ARE THERE SOME FIXES. WITHIN OUR OWN PROCESSES ARE YOU EVEN PERHAPS OR REGULATION -- SOMETIMES OUR OUR REGULATIONS ARE VERY DATED IN THE PROBABLY COULD STAND TO BE MODERNIZE AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE AS WELL OKAY. OF FINAL QUESTION IS YOU KNOW SO YOU'RE EXTENDING SATURDAY HOURS AN EVENING HOURS. SO IN MY HOME COUNTY OF ORANGE. YOU HAVE EXTENDED HOURS IN SANTA ANA AND YOU HAVE SATURDAY SERVICES IN COSTA MESA. BUT WE'RE A COUNTY OF THREE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE IS THERE ANYWAY TO ROTATE THE SATURDAYS SO SAY LAGUNA HILLS ONE SATURDAY A MONTH WILL BE OPEN. FOR IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RIGID WHERE MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE TO GO TO SANTA ANA COSTA MESA FOR THESE EXTENDED HOURS. I WILL ALLOW COOLEY TO ADDRESS OUR FIELD OFFICE PLANTS. WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT JIMMY VAN. EXPLORING THE IDEA OF KIND OF HAVING THESE BUT HE SAID NOT HAVING US REALLY SET SATURDAY'S BUT KIND OF POP UP LOCATIONS OPENNESS THAT RT. IN A PARTICULAR ROTATING AREA TO ALLOW. THOSE FOLKS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A SATURDAY OFFICE CLOSE TO THEM. AND SO I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE ARE I'M STRONGLY CONSIDERING BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT AS WELL IS NOT WE DO HAVE EXTENDED HOURS FROM SEVEN TO FIVE MANY IN YOUR REGION. I'M ALSO THIS SUMMER BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INCREASE IN FOLKS ARE COMING IN. YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT PEOPLE OUT OF SCHOOL VACATION THEY WANT TO COME INTO THE ANTI THAT WE ARE ALSO EXTEND THE ADDITIONAL HOURS AND FIFTY TWO OF OUR OFFICES FOR THE SUMMER FOR JULY AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. SO THAT SHOULD PROVIDE YOU SOME RELIEF AS WELL NO THANK YOU CAN TRAIN YOUR REGION WE'VE GOTTEN SEVERAL. LIKE IN HERE YEAH YOU'VE GOT WESTMINSTER DANNY I'M STANTON THAT THOSE THOSE ARE STILL COSTA MESA AREAS LIVE LAGUNA HILLS IN SACRAMENTO. I'VE GOTTEN A GOOD HEALTH YEAH. THERE THERE ARE LESS THAN WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED OF A PUBLIC AND WE ACTUALLY TOUCH THE PUBLIC WOULD YOU LIKE A CITY OF A MATE DO YOU PREFER EARLY. AND US BUT WE'D RATHER DO IT ON THE WAY AND NOT STOP BY ON THE WAY HOME FROM WORK AS WELL THAT'S ALSO A SAFETY AND SECURITY ISSUES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE US CHEN. THANK MISCREANT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR PREVIOUS TESTIMONY THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE ON TRACK TO MEET THE MAY TWENTY FOURTH EXTENDED THAT LINE% THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GAVE US. FOR REAL ID COMPLIANCE IS THAT ACCURATE THAT'S ACCURATE OKAY MY QUESTION IS. WHAT IS THE CONTINGENCY PLAN IF YOU DO NOT MEET? AND WHAT IS THE LEGAL WHAT IS THE LEGAL OR REAL WORLD THE FACT OF NOT MEETING THAT DEADLINE WHAT HAPPENS. I THINK WE'D HAVE TO BE IN CONVERSATION WITH HOMELAND SECURITY -- TO EXPLAIN WHY WE DIDN'T ROLL OUT ON APRIL TWENTY NINTH. BECAUSE THE GOAL IS TO ROLL OUT IN APRIL TWENTY NINTH IN THE WORLD AS I SAID BEFORE WERE ALREADY ASKING FOR SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS -- WERE PREPARE FROM A PROGRAMMING STANDPOINT THIS IS MORE OF A PROGRAMMING ASPECT WE'RE PREPARE FROM A PROGRAMMING STANDPOINT FOR OUR COUNTER OFFICES TO BASICALLY ACCEPT. AND RECORD TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS THAT'S READY TO ROLL -- THEY'VE COMPLETED THEIR TESTING AND ARE YOU AWARE COLLEEN OF ANY ISSUES AT THIS POINT I'M NOT AWAE OF ANYTHING. YEAH WE'RE READY TO GO HEAD IMPLEMENTED -- OFFICIALLY APRIL TWENTY NINTH AND SO I I I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT WILL KEEP US FROM COMPLYING. OKAY AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON ON CRATER ANALYSIS OR HISTORY OF THIS BUT HOW DID HOW DID THIS HAPPEN. ANYWAY. THE REAL ID ACT PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND FOR THIRTEEN YEARS THINGS KIND OF BOB ALONG I GUESS AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN. OF WHERE THE BIGGEST STATE IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL POWERHOUSE OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND WE ARE ARE WE ARE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT -- WHAT IT IS WE HAVE TO DO TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL LAW HOW DO HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN -- I REALIZE THIS ISN'T YOUR YOUR YOUR NEW. BUT AND BUT PLEASE JUST I MEAN JUST TELL US. I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE A TIME I ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS WHAT I CALL MILESTONES AND EXCHANGES THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. BUT YOU THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS THERE'S BEEN KIND OF A SEQUENCE OF CONVERSATIONS AND EVEN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WHEN IT CAME THROUGH IN. TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT WAS HOW ARE THEY GOING TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND HAVE OVERSIGHT WITH ALL THE STATE'S WHAT I FIND FASCINATING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF IT WE'VE HAD. ONE STATE THAT ACTUALLY FILE -- FILE THEIR OWN LEGISLATION TO NOT ACTUALLY COMPLY -- WE'VE HAD OTHER STATES THAT FRANKLY HAVE ONLY JUST STARTED TO ROLL OUT REAL ID SO YOU KNOW ARE ALL OUT TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN SOME CASES IS WAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE OF MANY STATES WHO -- ARE STILL ALL ADDRESSING THIS -- BUT PART OF IT WAS. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ALSO BEING SURE OF WHAT IMPLEMENTATION LOOKLIKE WORKING THROUGH THE NUANCES OF WHAT IMPLEMENTATION IS WHAT WOULD BE THE STANDARD OF ACCEPTANCE AND THEN INDIVIDUALLY EVERY STATE FIGURE OUT HOW. TO HOW TO MANAGE IT HINDSIGHT'S ALWAYS TWENTY TWENTY I CAN LOOK BACK AND SAY YEAH WE COULD HAVE PROBABLY DONE A BETTER JOB OF PLANNING YES WE COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB AROUND GOVERNANCE -- BUT I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU IT IT GOES BACK TO AGAIN WHAT I SHARED WITH YOU EARLIER WHEN YOU HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLS COMING OUT YOU WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING AND YOU'VE GOT TO DO PROGRAMMING A REAL ID. BUT THEN YOU GET BILLS THAT HAVE SENSITIVITY AROUND TIMELINES FOR IMPLEMENTATION WE ARE HAVING TO RE PRIORITIZE. AND SO I MOVING STAFF AROUND FROM OUR PROGRAMMING STANDPOINT TO ADDRESS THE THINGS OF A COMING IN LEGISLATIVELY. AND THEN REMEMBER ON THE HEELS OF ALL THE REAL IDEA ACTIVITY WAS IMPLEMENTING MOTOR VOTER -- AND SO WE HAD A LOT ON OUR PLATE IN AND OUT IT'S NOT PREFER PERFECT I CAN'T DEFEND IT YES IT WAS A WELL PLANNED. BUT WE SIT HERE TODAY BUT I THINK WE REALLY HAVE A SOLID PLAN GOING FORWARD AND THEN OUR HOPE IS THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT WE REALLY WANT TO BE COMPLIANT -- I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF THROWING PEOPLE AT SOLUTIONS BUT PEOPLE AT THE SOLUTIONS TO GET US THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY IS REALLY IMPORTANT UNTIL WE IT -- REALLY CREE ALTER OF METHODS IN GREAT THE DMV OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AND I THINK THE SUMMER IT AS YOU POINTED THAT OUT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN ONE OR TWO YEARS -- BUT WE DO HAVE TO MEET REAL ID AND I AGREE WITH -- THAT WHICH WAS RACES TWENTY TWENTY ONE COULD ALSO BE A BIG YEAR FOR US WHEN PEOPLE REALIZE THEY WANT A REAL ID. SO THE THE HEADLINE TODAY'S THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS MIGHT HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DMV AFTER ID FAILURE. I THINK YOU SAID THE REAL NUMBERS PROBABLY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION ARE THESE REAL IDEAS THAT WERE ISSUE THERE AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEEMED NON COMPLIANT. WHAT WHAT COMPRISES AT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION? SO THE ROOM THREE PORT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION WHO RECEIVE THEIR REAL ID ARE COMPLIANT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. IF THEY DON'T COME IN DURING THE RENEWAL PERIOD AND WILL HAVE TO WORK OUT WE'RE STILL IN CONVERSATIONS OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE -- IF OF THAT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION THEY DO NOT PROVIDE US A SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENT THE POINT IN TIME THAT THEY ARE UP FOR RENEWAL. WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO WHAT STEPS ARE YOU ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO TAKE OR ARE TAKING. TO NOTIFY OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT NEED TO PROVIDE A SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO SO WE HAVE -- MAILERS GOING OUT -- TO ALL THOSE FOLKS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY -- PART OF THE THREE POINT FOUR MILLION WE HAVE A LETTER. OUR HOPE IS THAT THE LETTER ITSELF WILL ACTUALLY SERVE AS A FORM SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENT. THEY CAN COMPLETE THAT LETTER IN THE FORM THAT'S WITH THAT AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAIL IT BACK TO US THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO IT IN A SEND UP PUT IN A DROP BOX AT A DMV OFFICE. I THINK THE OTHER PROCESS WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE INTERNET -- IS HAVING THE CAPABILITY TO PROCESS ON THE INTERNET WILL THEY BE ABLE TO SCAN IT INTO A PDF AND UP UPLOAD IT TO SOMETHING ONLINE WE'VE ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT DOING THAT AS WELL AND THAT'S AND THAT'S CERTAINLY. A PROCESS I THINK FOR US -- WHEN WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE SCANNING OF IT? I'M IS THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOMEBODY AT THE DMV OFFICE AND TO STAFF APPROPRIATELY TO GO AHEAD AND HANDLE THE SCANNING COMING AND AND THEN THE MAKING SURE IT WAS THE RIGHT DOCUMENT THAT WAS BEING SCANNED SO. I THINK AT THIS POINT -- WE WERE LOOKING AT WORK LOW DEMAND ASSOCIATE WITH ALSO ADDRESSING THE SECOND RUNS A DOCUMENT WE FELT THAT THE THE THREE APPROACHES WE GAVE A WOULD ALLOW US TO MANAGE THAT FROM WORKLOAD FOR SURE THE ACCURACY OF IT AND BILL SAYS FIRE SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT YOU'RE GONNA GIVE PEOPLE A VARIETY OPTIONS TO FULFILL THAT REQUIREMENT. THAT DO NOT REQUIRE THEM ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY GOING TO THE DMV AROUND POINT IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT AND SO THE ONES THAT WOULD BE LEFT WOULD BE THE FOLKS THAT DON'T OPEN THEIR MAIL OR THEY DON'T GET THEIR MAIL OR THEY GET. REALLY BUSY THAT MONTH -- OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT RIGHT AND AND WE ALSO HAVE TALK ABOUT -- AND PUTTING INTO PLACE FOLLOW UPS BECAUSE WE WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO IF HEY WANTED TO BE COMPLIANT WE DON'T WANT THEM TO NOT BE COMPLIANT WELL AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE NONE OF US WANT TO HAVE CONSTITUENTS THAT. HAVE A FLIGHT TO GO SEE THEIR ILL FAMILY MEMBER AROUND THE HOLIDAYS WHEN THIS THING FINALLY TAKES A FACT AND THEY TRY TO GET ON AN AIRPLANE THEY'RE TOLD THEY HAVE NOT COMPLAINED ID RIGHT. I MEAN NONE OF US TO DEAL WITH THAT. RIGHT IRATE CONSTITUENT. AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE FOR A GOVERNMENT AGENCY IF THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT DEGREES SO I I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU PLEASE YOU KNOW. I GET I GET THE YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF MANDATES AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF BALLS IN THE AIR AS IT WERE AND I ICE WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU AND LISTEN TO THIS IS THAT YOU'VE GOT. AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE THAT SERVE PERMEATING A LOT OF THESE ISSUES OLD. YEAH LET'S FIX THAT I MEAN LET'S FIX IT AND NOT THROW MONEY AT MORE STAFF WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH. WITH TECHNOLOGY HEY WE IT'S TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I MEAN I YOU KNOW I I RUN MY BUSINESS WITH A VIRTUALLY PAPERLESS IF IF NECESSARY MINUTE YOU CAN UPLOAD THINGS AND SCANNED THINGS IN FACT THINGS BUT THERE'S JUST SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. OF THE MALE GENERALLY WORKS I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT. THE THAT IT. AND A GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAN USE TECHNOLOGY TO NOT REQUIRE PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO BURN THEIR TIME TO GO AND PHYSICALLY STAND SOMEWHERE IN A AND IN A LONG LINE WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S REALLY. IT'S REALLY GONNA BE. SO. YOU KNOW AS WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD AND THE FIVE YEAR PLAN OR WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS I JUST. ENCOURAGE YOU ASK YOU BIG YOU [inaudible] PLEASE. LOOK AT TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS FIRST BECAUSE I THINK IN THE LONG RUN THAT'S THE KIND OF INVESTMENT AND THAT'S GOING MODERNIZE. THIS AGENCY I MEAN. I THINK YOU'RE HEARING FROM EVERYBODY HERE I MEAN PEOPLE ARE PASSED ABOUT THIS. AND IF YOU WERE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WASTED THEY'RE GOING AFTER I GOT CONSTITUENTS ON HERE ABOUT ALL THE TIME. ALL THE TIME. AND THE NUMBER. HI. WE GOT TO FIX THESE ISSUES AND AYE AYE AYE. I THINK THE STRIKE FORCE OF GIVE YOU SOME OPTIONS. I LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING IN TERMS OF YOUR ANSWER. PLEASE IF IF WE CAN CUT THAT NUMBER OF THREE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HAVE TO COME BACK IN. TO GET IT AN ID THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS VALID BECAUSE OF A SCREW UP BY SOMEBODY ELSE THE WASN'T THEIR FAULT. DOWN TO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE NUMBER THAT WOULD BE EXCELLENT I AGREE WITH YOU BECAUSE THAT'S JUST REALLY NOT FAIR TO PEOPLE JUST ISN'T SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS PATTERSON UP. I I DID I ACCURATELY UNDERSTAND THEY THEY AUDIT. WITH RESPECT. TO RELY DE SAID THAT [inaudible] THE DEPARTMENT REALLY DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT OF A VERY IMPORTANT -- PRIORITY UNTIL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS THAT THAT WAS IN THE AUDIT. I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I ATE A I WOULD HAVE TO TURN MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE MORE INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE BY THAT LET'S JUST SAY I KNOW THAT THE CONCLUSION OF THE AUDIT. WAS PRECISELY THAT. THAT WAS THAT THAT WASN'T AN AN ISSUE UNTIL TWENTY SEVEN ANOTHER AND UNLESS YOU. I THINK THAT THE AUDIT. WHAT WOMAN THIS WASN'T ACCURATE? THE AUDITOR THE FOLKS WHO DID THEY ARE COMING UP NEXT IF YOU WANT TO ASK A QUESTION TO THEM YEAH I THINK I WOULD JUST ADD WE LAUNCHED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO I HAD TO BE ENOUGH OF A PRIORITY FOR US TO LAUNCH IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN QUICKLY ON THE THAT THE MOTOR CARRIER PERMIT -- WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING A LOT OF AN INPUT IN MY OFFICE FROM THIS -- WE HAVE HAD SOME INFORMATION FROM. YOUR LIAISON LET LEGISLATIVE LIAISON FOLKS WITH RESPECT. TO WHERE IT IS AND THAT THAT COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN. THAT THE BACKLOG IS OVER BUT THAT THAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE THE TIME PROBLEMS. ARE STILL THERE IT'S ONE THING TO CLEAR A BACKLOG IT'S ANOTHER TO PROCESS. THE CURRENT INPUT. IN A TIMELY FASHION WE'RE GETTING. A LOT OF TRUCK OPERATIONS SOME SMALL SOME VERY VERY LARGE. GOT A GARBAGE TRUCK OPERATORS -- I MENTIONED THE THE TOW TRUCKS -- IT IS. HAVE WE SEEN THE LAST OF THIS. PROBLEM HERE BECAUSE IT JUST HERE IS ANOTHER. ONE AND THEN ANOTHER ONE AND THEN ANOTHER. ONE AND SO WE HEAR THAT THE BACKLOG IS GONE. BUT WHEN WE ASK FOR CLARIFICATION WE REALLY DON'T GET A CLEAR ANSWER WELL IF THE BACKLOGS GONE IS THE TIME DELAY GONE AS WELL I WAS NUMBER. ONE NUMBER TWO WE SORT OF GOT AN ANSWER WHETHER WAS ONLY FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SOME ODD. WELL. THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE WELL THAT'S JUST A SMALL LITTLE AMOUNT. BUT THOSE PERMIT HOLDERS THEY MAY HAVE A HUNDRED TRUCKS. THEY MAKE AND IN THE CASE THAT I MENTIONED ON THAT THE TOW TRUCK -- THAT THAT COULD HAVE SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED TRUCKS STATEWIDE SO IT FEELS LIKE BY THE INCOMING WE'RE GETTING THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT AND SERIOUS. SLOWDOWN THAT IS AFFECTING A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO LOGISTICS AND THE TRANSPORTATION OF GOODS SO HELP ME. UNDERSTAND ARE WE REALLY OVER THIS PROBLEM. I THINK TO THE EXTENT WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT CREATED THE BACKLOG YOU TALKED ABOUT I BELIEVE THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED. AS A RELATES TO THE BUSINESS PROCESSES SO SAY WITH PROCESSING THESE -- VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS ARE LICENSES -- I NEED TO VISIT WITH NOT ONLY MY TEAM WHO ACTUALLY MANAGES THAT. BUT I ALSO WANT TO HEAR FROM OUR CUSTOMER -- I HAVE SINCE I'VE BEEN -- IN MY POSITION HAVE MET WITH A NUMBER OF ASSOCIATIONS -- WHETHER IT'S A NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION OF THE INDEPENDENT CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS. TO LOOK AT THE PROCESSES IN WHICH WE GO AHEAD AND AND INTERACT AND DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ACTUALLY. LOOK AT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES WITH THEM HAND IN HAND -- IF FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN STREAMLINE SOME OF THOSE PROCESSES THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A SOME OF OUR REGULATIONS WHO WHICH ARE VERY OLD IN SOME CASES. IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT MODERNIZING OUR REGULATIONS AND IN SOME CASES. THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OPPORTUNITY TO MODERNIZE OUR REGULATIONS AND SOME OF OUR REQUIREMENTS SO TO ME THAT'S A PARTNERSHIP DISCUSSION WE NEED TO HAVE WITH THEM HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT WE PROVIDE THE A LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE SAFETY ON OUR ROADS ALSO. ENSURE THAT THE PROCESSES ARE EFFICIENT SO I WANT TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE WITH THEM. IT'S JUST IT'S STILL REMAINS A A CONCERNED WE'RE STILL GETTING INPUT IN MY OFFICE TODAY AND IT'S NOT JUST FROM OUR REGION. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR THREE YEARS IT STARTED WITH TRUCK DRIVERS. AND NOW HERE WE ARE. WITH ANOTHER TRUCK DRIVING PROBLEM MAY WE WOULD MAKE WE WERE MAKING THESE TRUCK DRIVER STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED FROM -- EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ACCREDITED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE HAVING TO WAIT LONG LONG PERIODS OF TIME JUST TO GET TAP TESTED. AND THEY WERE LOSING JOB OPPORTUNITIES AT A TIME WHEN WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND ON FIELD. TRUCKING POSITIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NOW THREE YEARS LATER HERE HERE'S ANOTHER TRUCK DRIVER -- ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO PERMITTING. AND HONESTLY THOUGH THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE. FAILURE IS REALLY TROUBLING BECAUSE MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE SAID. WELL IF YOU CAN'T. IF WE CAN'T GET YOU THE PERMIT IN TIME. THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS SHUT DOWN. THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION. AND YET MY HOPE IS THAT THE OLD. WORK WITH THE DMV AND OTHERS WITH RESPECT TO ENFORCEMENT YOU CAN'T. MISS THESE KIND OF IMPORTANT PERMITS AND THEN MAKE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PAY. THE CONSEQUENCE GETTING PULLED OVER FOR SOMETHING THAT REALLY WAS OUT OF THERE. ABILITY TO CONTROL SO I WANTED TO RAISE THAT I STILL THINK THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS THERE AND LET'S HOPE WE CAN WE CAN GET TO THOSE IT'S IT'S A FIRE DRILL THAT I THINK NEEDS. TO NEEDS TO HAPPEN I WOULD LOOK FOR TO HAVE A FUTURE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ON ALL OF THAT. THANK YOU. THANK INCLUDE SOME ARE SHORT PANEL. ONE SO WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING -- TO PANEL TO WILL BE GOOD TO TALK ABOUT THE EVALUATIONS OF THE DMV OPERATIONS -- THANK YOU TO THE SECRETARY BADGER FOR YOUR PATIENCE AS WELL AS THE STAFF FROM THE OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE SENATOR BADGER. START WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THAT I OWN. I'M SORRY SO I NEED THE WRONG ABOUT THE NUMBER THAT WAS ME POLITICS. I'D I'D BUT MY EARS ARE PLUGS SO I WASN'T SURE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ON BUT I CAN HEAR ONLY UP WHEN YOU'RE TODAY -- ANYWAY SO I WILL CONTINUE I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE STRIKE TEAM IS DOING THAT I BELIEVE WILL HAVE LONG TERM IMPACT. FOR THE DMV AND ITS CUSTOMERS THESE ACTIONS COUPLED WITH OUR BUDGET PROPOSALS WILL BRING SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. AND REINVENTION THAT IS SO CRITICALLY NEEDED IN THE DMV AND TO THE PEOPLE. THEY SERVE FIRST LET ME BE CLEAR. ABOUT THE MISSION OF THE STRIKE TEAM OBJECTIVE IS TO BEGIN THE WORK OF REINVENTING THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC FACING AGENCY WE ARE NOT SIMPLY TALKING TO PEOPLE AND THEN PLANNING TO WRITE A REPORT. THE DMV'S TRACK RECORD AND SYSTEMIC SHORT COMINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THEM FROM -- JENNIFER -- IS FROM THE AUDIT AND DMV'S CUSTOMERS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT ANY LONGER FOR THE CHANGE THAT IS SO NEEDED. THE STRIKE TEAM IS ACTION ORIENTED AND ARE ALREADY MAKING CHANGES THAT WE EXPECT WILL HELP THE DMB AND ITS CUSTOMERS NOW AND WELL INTO THE FUTURE. WE ALL KNOW THE DMB IS GRAPPLING WITH TO SIGNIFICANT ISSUES REAL IDEA MOTOR VOTER THE REAL ID HAS A FAST APPROACHING DEADLINE WHICH WE'VE DISCUSSED TODAY. EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHO NEEDS TO FLYER AND RE SECURE FEDERAL FACILITY OR MILITARY BASE. AND DOES NOT HAVE A VALID. SPORT MISS HAVE A REAL ID BY OCTOBER. ONE TWENTY TWENTY GETTING A REAL ID REQUIRES A VISIT TO THE DMV OFFICE AND WHILE THERE IS NO WAY AROUND THAT VISIT WE ARE ALREADY WORKING ON SEVERAL EFFORTS WHICH I'LL DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL. TO GET A REAL ID TO AS MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED ONE BEFORE THE DEADLINE WAS SICK. WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING FIELD OFFICE WAIT TIMES MOTOR VOTER IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE WE BELIEVE BETTER OUTCOMES ARE WITHIN REACH AS A DMB IMPROVES ITS TRAINING. PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGY. AS WITH EVERYTHING WHEN CHANGE IS NOT THE SILVER BULLET ESPECIALLY FOR AN ORGANIZATION IS AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS DMV NOT TO MENTION. ONE WITH A HIS HISTORY OF SILO TO TOP DOWN DECISION MAKING THE STRIKE TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING ON A SERIES OF ACTIONS THAT I BELIEVE WILL BRING NEW WAYS OF OPERATING. BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY TO DMV'S. THESE MAY START WITH ONE FOCUS BUT WILL. I BELIEVE. B. THEN ABLE TO BE CARRIED THROUGH ALL CORNERS OF THE ORGANIZATION THE STRIKE TEAM WORKED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO LAUNCH A SEARCH FOR A PERMANENT DIRECTOR OF THE DMV -- IT IS NOW POSTED OF COURSE ON THE GOVERNOR'S -- WEBSITE THE SEARCH FOCUSES ON THE NEED FOR A VISIONARY PRAGMATIC DIRECTOR TO SERVE ALL OF CALIFORNIANS. THE STRIKE TEAM IS WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT. IN SEEKING QUALIFIED APPLICANTS TO FEEL IMPORTANT VACANCIES AND A NUMBER OF KEY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS INCLUDING LEADERSHIP AND CUSTOMER CENTERED PROCESS REDESIGNS THESE ROLES ARE ESSENTIAL. TO A CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION WHICH I BELIEVE IS REQUIRED TO CREATE A CUSTOMER CENTERED DMV ORGANIZATION THE STRIKE TEAM REVIEWED DEPARTMENT'S IT CAPACITY. TO ASSESS THE DMV'S READINESS TO MODERNIZE THE DELIVERY OF IT SERVICES. THIS MEANS BUILDING I TO CAPACITY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON HUMAN AND TECHNICAL INFO INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUSED ON DELIVERY SERVICE DELIVERY SECURITY AND RELIABILITY. ULTIMATELY THIS PORTFOLIO REVIEW OF THEIR IT SYSTEMS WE FOUND A GREAT DEAL A GREAT NEEDS GIVES ME TO SHORE UP KEY TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. THE DMB AUTOMATION SYSTEM THE DM VA WHICH HAS BEEN REFERRED TO EARLIER. HAS OBSOLETE PROPRIETARY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND LACKS FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT OPERATIONAL CHANGES. WE DECIDED THAT TECHNICAL INSTABILITY SHOULD BE ADDRESSED PRIOR TO MODERNIZING THE FRONT AND SYSTEMS USED BY DMB STAT IN ORDER TO REDUCE SYSTEM OUTAGES THAT AFFECT THE PUBLIC AND INSURE A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE TECHNICAL. AND BUSINESS CHANGES AS I MIGHT SAY WE HAVE -- EXPERIENCE SOME OF THOSE TODAY OUT EVER I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE OUTAGE THIS MORNING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT WAS A ADD. AS DATA. AS CENTER ISSUE AT CDT WAS NOT AT THE DMV A ISSUE ONE OF THE PERENNIAL FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE DANNY IS THAT WHILE YOU CAN USE A CREDIT CARD ONLINE OR AT A KIOSK YOU CAN'T USE. ONE WHEN YOU GO TO THE FIELD OFFICE GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS CALLED THIS OUT AND I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT IT MAKES NO SENSE. THAT IN AN ERA WHERE I CAN USE MY CREDIT CARD ALMOST ANY LOCATION THE WORLD I CAN'T USE THE DMV OFFICE. THE STRIKE TEAM LOOKED AT PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO CREDIT CARD USE AT THE DMV INCLUDING SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES. THE STRIKE TEAM IN THE DMV RELEASED AN INVITATION TO NEGOTIATE FOR BIDDERS TO RESPOND. TO ON MARCH ELEVENTH THE CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED BY THE END OF APRIL TO A CREDIT CARD VENDOR. IN MAY JUNE WILL WORK TO COMBINED DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD SERVICES BEGIN TO PILOT IN THE FIELD OFFICE BY JULY WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. AS ACTING DIRECTOR WEB MENTIONED ONE OF OUR KEY EFFORTS IS TO AVOID UNNECESSARY VISITS TO THE FIELD OFFICE. WE WANT TO IMPROVE. THE DMV WEBSITE AGAIN THIS BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. TO MAKE SURE -- CAN EASILY FIND INFORMATION THEY NEED WE PROPOSE AN OPERATION TO DO A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF THE WEBSITE USING BEST PRACTICES OF HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN WITH A FOCUS ON ONLINE SERVICES. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO DESIGN A MODERN WEBSITE THAT PUTS CUSTOMERS FIRST AND MAKES IT MAKES IT EASIER TO CONDUCT ONLINE TRANSACTIONS. IF YOU CAN'T FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON THE WEBSITE THE NEXT STEP IS OFFICE TO OFTEN TO PICK UP THE PHONE. WELL THAT EXPERIENCE HAS ALSO BEEN FRUSTRATING FOR DMV CUSTOMERS THE STRIKE TEAM BROUGHT IN THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WHO OPERATES ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT. CALL CENTERS IN THE STATE TO DO A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE DAM THESE CALL CENTER PRACTICES AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES. AMONG ITS FINDINGS WERE. THAT THE DMB SHOULD DEVELOP AN ANNUAL COMP COMPREHENSIVE HIRING AND TRAINING PLAN USE CUSTOMER SERVICE SIMULATION SIMULATIONS TO EVALUATE CANDIDATES FOR BASIC SKILLS. NEEDED IN A CALL CENTER MANAGER ONES HAVE SPENT UP 280% OF THEIR TIME ON PHONE SINCE AUGUST THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE FOR STAFF DEVELOPMENT COACHING COMPLETING REPORTS OTHER SUPERVISORY FUNCTIONS WHICH WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE. OUT OF FOREIGN AND TWENTY NINE PHONE AGENTS AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE OR ON THE PHONES BECAUSE THEY'RE PERFORMING BASIC OFFICE WORK. UPGRADE TO PERSONAL COMPUTERS SO THAT TECHNICIANS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO EMAIL AND ONLINE MANUALS CURRENTLY TECHNICIANS MUST REFERENCE PAPER MANUALS TO LEARN THE PROCESSES MONOPODS HERE FOR ONE SECOND BECAUSE A MEMBER COOPER RAISED A REFRESH OF OF COMPUTERS ON OUR IN OUR LEARNING AND THAT OF A FINANCE. THERE WERE -- YEAR AFTER YEAR REFRESHING OF COMPUTERS AND THE TECHNICIANS OF THE CALL CENTERS DON'T EVEN HAVE A COMPUTER SO WHEN A WHEN A CUSTOMER CALLS UP AND HAS SOMETHING THEY CAN'T DO A WORD SEARCH EXCEPT BY DOING IT THIS WAY. IT'S TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE AND INEFFICIENT THE DMB IS ALREADY PREPARING AN ACTION PLAN TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES -- THAT AD FTP HAS DISCOVERED AND THEY ARE ALREADY BEGINNING. TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS ADDITIONALLY AS ACT ACTING DIRECTOR WEB TESTIFIED WE HOPE TO EXPAND SERVICES FOR THE PUBLIC BY ADDING TOOLS SUCH AS CHAT BOT. LIVE CHAT AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO PROCESS MORE ROUTINE TRANSACTIONS BY PHONE TECHNICIANS THE LIMITED ANOTHER NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THEY CURRENTLY ALLOWED TO PERFORM WE'RE WANTING TO EXPAND THOSE. ALL OF OUR EFFORTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP CUSTOMERS FIND ACCURATE EASY TO UNDERSTAND INFORMATION IN THE MANNER THAT BEST WORKS FOR THEM WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE FIELD OFFICE. TO THAT END WE ARE PLANNING TO EXPAND THIS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL THE NUMBER OF SELF SERVICE TERMINALS ARE KIOSKS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND ADDING SERVICES TO THOSE KIOSKS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY WHICH YOU'VE HEARD A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO KIOSKS IN FIELD OFFICES AND RETAIL AND OTHER NON FIELD OFFICE LOCATIONS. WE HOPE TO ADD I THINK ROBBIE SAID THIS EARLIER WE HOPE TO ADD AT THE STRIKE. TEAMS A SUGGESTION A HUNDRED SELF SERVICE TERMINALS AT KEY LOCATIONS BY SUMMER AND ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THE USAGE OF THESE CHAOS HAS RISEN AGAIN WAS. MENTIONED EARLIER AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS WERE PROCESSED ON THE KIOSKS IN FEBRUARY. THIS IS WHY WE HOPE TO NOT ONLY ADD MORE KIOSK BUT ALSO TO ADD MORE SERVICES -- CURRENTLY THE ONLY PROCESS. THE ONLY MACHINES THAT THE MACHINES CURRENTLY ONLY PROCESS SKEWS ME VEHICLE REGISTRATION RENEWALS BUT WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THEY DO MANY MORE FUNCTIONS AND OTHER STATES SAME VENDOR. FOR EXAMPLE THE ABILITY OF CHAOS TO ISSUE A REPLACEMENT DRIVER'S LICENSE WOULD SAVE THOUSANDS OF FIELD OFFICE VISITS A YEAR. AS ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LOSE THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE A YEAR AND THEY END UP VISIT IN A FIELD OFFICE TO HAVE A REPLACEMENT THE STRIKE TEAM IS ALSO WORKING ON A PILOT PROJECT TO BRING THE DMV. TO MAJOR COMPANIES IN THE STATE IN ORDER TO HELP THEIR EMPLOYEES GET A REAL ID THIS POP UP DMV IS AIMED AT STATES BUSINESS TRAVELERS WITH ADVANCE NOTICE AND COORDINATION EMPLOYERS COULD PREPARE EMPLOYEES TO PULL TOGETHER. REQUIRED DOCUMENTS FOR THE REAL ID BRING THEM TO WORK ON A DESIGNATED DAY AND COMPLETE THE ENTIRE APPLICATION PROCESS AT THEIR WORK LOCATION IN MINUTES. WE HAVE THE FIRST PILOT SCHEDULED FOR HEALTH NET HERE IN SACRAMENTO REGION FOR LATER THIS MONTH IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE HOPE TO HAVE MANY MORE X. LARGE CORPORATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE INVOLVED IN OUR DMB POP UP -- PLAN WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN GET APPOINTMENTS AT THE DMV WHEN THEY NEED THEM. THAT IS WHY I HAD MET WITH THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER TO MATIC THE DMV'S APPOINTMENT BETTER. VENDOR TO IMPROVE THE PROCESSES AND TO ESCALATE AND RESOLVE ISSUES AND MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO PREVENT INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES FOR MAKING MULTIPLE APPOINTMENTS. WE ALSO ARE GOING TO EXAMINE THE COMMUNICATIONS AROUND REAL ID WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHOSE LICENSES ARE EXPIRING BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY KNOW THAT THEY NEED A REAL ID IF THEY INTEND TO FLY OR ENTERING SECURE FEDERAL. FACILITY OR DO NOT HAVE A VALID PASSPORT JUST AS IMPORTANT AS KNOWING WHETHER A REAL IDEAS NEEDED IS KNOWING WHAT DOCUMENT TO BRING WITH THEM TO THE FIELD OFFICE. OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE ONE VISIT ONLY IN ORDER TO GET A REAL ID THAT MEANS WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE CLEARLY ABOUT WHAT EVERY PERSON NEEDS TO BRING WITH THEM. AND IN SOME CASES SUCH AS WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A NAME CHANGE IT CAN BE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED UNTIL NOW DM THE HAS CREATED ALL OF THE MESSAGING AND MATERIALS. AROUND REAL ID IN HOUSE WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF KNOWING WHETHER THE MESSAGING IS RESONATING. AT A TARGET AT A TARGETED AUDIENCE THIS IS WHY THE STRIKE TEAM IS ASKING FOR FUNDING FOR A MAJOR OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. THE STRIKE TEAM. INTERVIEWED VENDORS WITH EXPERIENCE RUNNING NATIONAL AND STATE WIDE CAMPAIGNS WE TALKED TO OUR COLLEAGUES AT COVER CALIFORNIA AND COMPLETE COUNT SENSES. TWENTY TWENTY OFFICE ABOUT THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF THEIR CURRENT MARKETING AND OUTREACH EFFORTS ON STATEWIDE CAMPAIGNS. RESEARCH IS CRITICAL AND WE EXPECT THE CAMPAIGN TO USE A NUMBER OF STANDARD AND CUSTOM TOOLS TO ASSESS THESE DIFFERENT MARKET SEGMENTS. AND LEVERAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE INFLUENTIAL IN THOSE SEGMENTS TO HELP SPREAD OUR MESSAGE IN A WAY THAT RESONATES WITH SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY. WE WANT A COMPREHENSIVE CAMPAIGN THAT IS BOTH EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT THE DEADLINE FOR GETTING THE REAL ID WELL STATED OCTOBER. ONE TWENTY TWENTY HAPPENS TO FALL IN THE THICK OF THE GENERAL ELECTION WHEN MEDIA BUYS ARE AT A PREMIUM PREMIUM. TO MEASURE SUCCESS WILL GAUGE AWARENESS WITH A PRE CAMPAIGN SURVEY AND THEN FOLLOWED UP WITH A POST CAMPAIGN SURVEY TO ASSESS IT. WE ALSO WANT TO INCREASE OUR COMMUNICATION AROUND REAL ID BY ESTABLISHING BOOTHS AT THE MAJOR CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS AROUND RELY DE. AND OTHER DMV SERVICES THE STRIKE TEAM AND DMB ARE WORKING WITH TSA -- ON THE PLACEMENT OF THESE POSTS NOW IN ANOTHER EFFORT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS VISITING FIELD OFFICES TO COME. PLATE TASTIC COULD BE DONE ONLINE WE ARE TALKING TO VENDORS ABOUT MODERNIZING THE DMV'S APPROACH TO AUTHENTICATING CUSTOMERS IDEA ONLINE SERVICES. CURRENTLY DIEM THESE CUSTOMERS CAN CONFIRM THEIR ID ONLINE -- FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE AND IDENTIFICATION CARD APPLICATIONS THE SERVICE COULD BE EXTENDED TO STREAMLINE THE REAL ID APPLICATION PROCESS. BY ALLOWING DMV CUSTOMERS TO UPLOAD AND STORE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS BEFORE GOING INTO THE FIELD OFFICE OR WHILE WAITING IN LINE. THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE THE CUSTOMER HAS A COMPLETE APPLICATION AND REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION WHEN VISITING A FIELD OFFICE THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE COMPLETED QUICKLY AVOIDING RETURN VISITS. THE FIELD OFFICE TECHNICIAN WOULD ONLY NEED TO VERIFY THE CUSTOMER'S DOCUMENTS THIS COULD. SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE TRANSACTION TIMES THIS IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION WILL BE SEAMLESS TO THE CUSTOMER AND CUSTOMERS WILL NO LONGER NEED TO REMEMBER A LOG IN. OR PASSWORD TO USE ONLINE SERVICES CURRENTLY DMV'S IDENTITY MANAGEMENT REQUIRES CUSTOMERS INTO THE LAST FOUR DIGITS OF THEIR SSN. THIS CHANGE WILL ALLOW MORE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AND USE DAM THESE ONLINE SERVICES. DMV ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE THREE POINT SIX MILLION CUSTOMERS WHO USE ONLINE TRACKS ACT TRANSACTIONS REQUIRING A LOG IN ANNUALLY. AND AS WE LOOK TOWARD DMB OF THE FUTURE THE STRIKE TEAM IS LOOKING TO PUT OUT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. TO DEVELOP WORKPLACE STRATEGIES ANALYTICS AND USE RETAIL DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE BASIS OF A NEW DESIGN THAT WILL OPTIMIZE THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. TO A MORE FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN A DMV INDEED OF THE FUTURE FINALLY WE BELIEVE THERE MUST BE A COMPREHENSIVE CHANGE IN HOW THE DMV WORKS. THE STRIKE TEAM AND DMV HAVE ENGAGED MCKINSEY AND COMPANY TELL DMB FOCUS. THE START OF ITS CULTURAL CHANGE ON IMPROVING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AROUND REAL ID THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO UNDERTAKE A SERIES OF THREE RELATED DESIGN SPRINTS. FOCUSING ON COMMUNICATIONS EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND FIELD OFFICE ACTIVITIES FOR ISSUING REAL ID'S. EMBEDDING DIEM THE EMPLOYEES INTO THE PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL TO GETTING IT RIGHT AND KEY TO TEACHING STAFF NEW WAYS TO REDESIGN OUTMODED PROCESSES QUICKLY. LAST WEEK AND MAKING Z. MADE THREE FEEL BEST AT OFFICE VISITS AND PLAN TO VISIT ANOTHER DOZEN. IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. MCKENZIE SENT OUT A SURVEY TO LEARN ABOUT REAL ID MARKET SEGMENTS AND WHAT MOTIVATES DECISION MAKING THEY ARE ANALYZING FIELD OFFICE DATA FROM DMV AS WELL AS FIELD OFFICE OBSERVATIONS FROM SITE VISITS INCLUDING THE MAPPING OF CUSTOMER JOURNEYS. TO THE FIELD OFFICE THEY WILL USE THESE ELEMENTS AND OTHERS TO START DEVELOPING PROTOTYPES FOR IMPROVED FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER FLOW. THEY WILL THEN TEST AND REFINE SIMILAR PROTOTYPING SPRINTS FOR COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT REAL ID IN TRAINING FOR THE FIELD OFFICE EMPLOYEES WILL RESULT IN BETTER PREPARED CUSTOMERS BETTER TRAINED EMPLOYEES AND REDUCTION IN TIME. THE TRANSACTIONS TAKE. THIS WILL HELP THE FIELD OFFICE TO HANDLE THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN CUSTOMER SEEKING REAL THE ID'S AND ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS WHO LACKED THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS DON'T WAIT IN LINE ONLY TO LEARN. THAT THEY ARE PREPARED ONCE THEY GET TO THE COUNTER. WELL ALL OF THE MACKENZIE'S WORK IS FOCUSED ON THE PROCESSING SURROUNDING REAL ID'S THESE LESSONS OUR RESEARCH OUR USER RESEARCH USING PROTOTYPES TO TEST NEW APPROACHES AND FOCUSING SOLUTION ON CUSTOMER NEEDS WILL CASCADE AND TRANSLATE. TO OTHER KEY DMB FUNCTIONS ANOTHER KEY AREA THAT BOTH THE STRIKE TEAM N. O. S. I.. O. SE SKEWS ME -- AS A SAY LET'S SEE ALSO WAS AYE. SKEWS ME AUDIT FOUND LACKING IS TRAINING TRAINING MATERIALS ARE OUT OF DATE AND WHILE DMB SETS ASIDE AN HOUR FOR TRAINING EACH WEEK IT IS UNCLEAR HOW WELL THIS TIME IS USED AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS. THE LACK OF ROBUST TRAINING IS WHY WE ARE ORGANIZING A TRAINING STAND DOWN. DAY THIS SUMMER FOR ONE DAY WE WILL CLOSE DMV OFFICES TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE UNIFORMED TRAINING AND ALL FIELD OFFICES. I KNOW THAT THIS IS IT SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT BUT I THINK WE NEED. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT TO MAKE CLEAR TO OUR DIEM THE EMPLOYEES. HOW IMPORTANT THEIR WORK IS TO THE STATE AND INDEED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS? I HOPE THIS IS GIVING YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THE STRIKE TEAM HAS BEEN DOING. I BELIEVE WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT PROGRESS AND ARE ON A PATH TO MAKE MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DMV AND OF COURSE I'M VERY HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU WANT. TO YOU WANT TO GO NEXT. PLEASE. I DON'T THINK THIS IS ON GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JENNIFER WOULD OCCUR AND I'M FROM THE OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS AND ALSO WITH ME IS MARYLAND STANDING HORSE WHO IS THE MANAGER ON THE ASSIGNMENT. AND WE'RE GOING -- TO GIVE YOU A I DON'T THINK IT'S ON SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVITE US TO THIS HEARING SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE A BRIEF -- SUMMARY OF OUR DMV AUDIT RESULTS AS YOU KNOW IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AT THE DIRECTION OF GOVERNOR BROWN FINANCE BEGAN. THE PERFORMANCE AUDIT AT THE DMV AND WE ISSUED OUR REPORT IN MARCH OF MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND WE HAD TO AUDIT OBJECTIVES AND WE BEGAN THE AUDIT THE FIRST AUDIT OBJECTIVE WAS THE ASSESS THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DMV'S OPERATIONS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR PRACTICES. AND ENHANCE THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER SERVICE OUR SECOND OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE DMV'S IT SYSTEM AND ITS IMPACT ON THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER SERVICE BOTH OBJECTIVES -- WERE AROUND THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WELL PERFORMING OUR AUDIT WE INTERVIEWED OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EMPLOYEES AT DMV SACRAMENTO HEADQUARTERS IN FIELD OFFICES RANGING FROM THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF DMV. TO MOTOR VEHICLE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE FIELD OFFICES WE EVALUATED OVER THREE HUNDRED RESPONSES RECEIVED VIA OUR WEBSITE WE HAD A A EMPLOYEE CAUGHT PLAY OR A CUSTOMER FORM ONLINE WHERE PEOPLE COULD COME IN AND PROVIDE ANONYMOUS FEEDBACK TO US. AND WE ALSO AND DESERVE OPERATIONS FROM THE CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE AT THREE THIRTY FIELD OFFICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHERE AND STAFF WERE -- WENT IN AND NOT ON IT THEY WERE ANNOUNCED THEY WERE NOT AN AUDITOR ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY WHEN THEY WENT AND THE AUDIT MANAGER WILL NOW SHARE THE RESULTS OF THE BOTH OBJECTIVES. THANK YOU THE AFTERNOON MARYLAND STANDING HORSE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. AS DESCRIBED IN OUR AUDIT REPORT DMV OPERATIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. MANY OPPORTUNITIES EXIST TO IMPROVE DMV'S PRACTICES AND ENHANCE THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. OUR AUDIT REPORT RESULTS ARE ORGANIZED INTO TWO CHAPTERS ONE FOR EACH OF OUR AUDIT OBJECTIVES. EACH FINING THE COMPANY BY DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT DMV HAS TO ENHANCE THEIR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE. WITH REGARD TO THEIR OPERATIONS AND IT -- I WILL NOW PRESENT A SUMMARY OF THOSE FINDINGS. OURFIRST AUDIT OBJECTIVE ON DMV OPERATIONS AND THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. RESULTED IN SEVEN FINDINGS AS FOLLOWS [inaudible] FINDING. ONE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REAL ID PROGRAM. THESE INCLUDED AN INCONSISTENT APPROACH FOR PLANNING FOR REAL ID AND THE DECADE LEADING UP TO IMPLEMENTATION. DELAYED PRIORITIZATION OF THE RELATED IT PROJECT UNTIL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO REDESIGN POLICY FOR THE FREQUENCY THAT CUSTOMERS REQUIRED DMV SERVICES. THE SECOND FINDING. IS THAT DMV OPERATES UNDER AN OUTDATED ORGANIZATIONAL AND REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR EXAMPLE FIELD OFFICE GRADES GRADES WHICH DETERMINE THE SIZE AND RESOURCE NEEDS OF FIELD OFFICES. WERE LAST ASSESSED STATEWIDE IN. NINETEEN NINETY FURTHER MORE REGIONAL OFFICE OVERSIGHT OVER FIELD OFFICES IS IT. INCONSISTENT AND DMV'S INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURE TO FIELD OFFICES IS INEFFICIENT. IN PART DUE TO FIELD OFFICE EMPLOYEES NOT HAVING -- A DMV EMAIL -- DMV EMAIL ACCESS. OUR THIRD FINDING IS THAT DMV STAFFING AND BUDGETING APPROACH IS NOT FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING FIELD OFFICE CAPACITY. ON AVERAGE 30% OF FIELD OFFICE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED AND THEREFORE NOT ASSISTING CUSTOMERS DURING OUR OBSERVATIONS. IN ADDITION LONG TERM RELIABLE DATA ON FIELD OFFICE ABSENTEEISM WAS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. ALSO DMV DOES NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE PROCESS TO ALLOCATE POSITIONS TO FIELD OFFICES TO EFFECTIVELY HANDLE THEIR CUSTOMER DEMAND. OUR FOURTH FINDING IS THAT APPOINTMENT PRACTICES NEED IMPROVEMENT. SPECIFICALLY DMV'S APPOINTMENT SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR DIFFERENCES AND APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THE RESERVATION OF DUPLICATE APPOINTMENTS. OUR FIFTH FINDING IS THAT STATEWIDE MONITORING OF THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THESE IMPROVEMENTS. INITIATIVE SUCH AS THE COMMAND CENTER AND LEAN SIX SIGMA TEAM WERE UNTIMELY AND IMPLEMENTED WITH REGARD TO THE SUMMER TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAIT TIMES. AND THESE GROUPS COULD DO MORE TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. ALSO DMV'S INTERNAL AUDIT UNIT DOES NOT AUDIT CUSTOMER SERVICE RELATED TOPICS. OUR SIXTH FINDING IS THAT THE FIELD OFFICE -- FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOLS SUCH AS LINE TRIAGE AND ACCURATELY TRACKING AN ADVERTISING CUSTOMER WAIT TIMES. AND TABLET IN TEXAS A FEW CATIONS WERE INCONSISTENTLY IMPLEMENTED. OUR SEVEN FINDING. IS THAT FIELD OFFICE EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND RESOURCES ARE INADEQUATE FOR EXAMPLE MORE THAN OFFICES WE VISITED. HAD ATTENDED NEITHER A DRIVER'S LICENSE NOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION TRAINING -- ARE SECONDS AUDIT OBJECTIVE AND THE SECOND CHAPTER REPORT FOCUSES ON I TEASE IMPACT ON THE FIELD OFFICE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. AND THAT SECTION HAS THREE FINDINGS. THE FIRST FINDING IS THAT THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES AND LACK OF NETWORK MONITORING PROCESS SEES WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO FIELD OFFICE OUTAGES. ALSO DMV'S PRIORITIZATION AND RESOLUTION OF I. T. ISSUES NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. THE SECOND I. T. RELATED FINDING IS THAT THE REAL ID I. T. PROJECT DID NOT FOLLOW IT INDUSTRY STANDARDS WITH REGARD TO PRIORITIZATION. RESOLVING PROJECT THE FAX TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION. AND THE THIRD FINDING. IS THAT DMV'S USE OF LEGACY COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR SUCCESSION PLANNING RISKS. WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR REPORT DMV WILL CONTINUE FACING CHALLENGES AND EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY DELIVERING SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS. WE REQUESTED DETAILED CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN FROM DMV WHICH IS DUE IN MAY. DESCRIBING THEIR PLANNED ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE FINDINGS ARE CORRESPONDING RECOMMENDATIONS. OUR PLAN IS TO MONITOR THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN PROGRESS. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TO SHARE AND DISCUSS THE RESULTS WITH YOU TODAY. WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE REGARDING THESE RESULTS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. THIS BOOK. SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE PRESENTATIONS BUT YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY NOT UNLIKE THE FIRST PANEL WHAT I'M NOT HEARING TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY'S POINT EARLIER IS. I AM AND AND PERHAPS THAT'S PART OF THE THE AUDIT CORRECTIONS SUGGESTIONS BUT A SYSTEM BY WHICH THE MOST CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES ARE MET IN A TIMELY MANNER. METRICS FOR MEETING THOSE MOST CRITICAL NEEDS TO TRY TO RIGHT THE SHIP AND THEN WHAT THE TIME LINE FOR THAT WORK LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE WHAT I AM HEARING AS WE UNDERSTAND THERE ARE THERE ARE MYRIAD CONCERNS. THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT VERY OFTEN INSTITUTIONALLY WHEN YOU GO TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ALL AT ONCE YOU'RE ACCOMPLISHING RELATIVELY NOTHING IN AND IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME TO DO THAT. AND SO I THINK AND I'VE HEARD CONSISTENTLY FROM THIS COMMITTEE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHAT DOES THE TIMELINE LOOK LIKE WHAT ARE THOSE MEASURABLE METRICS WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE IT? ALL SPEAK THE REGARDING THE AUDIT -- ARE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WHICH IS DUE SIXTY DAYS FROM THE AUDIT ISSUANCE WHICH WILL BE AROUND MAY -- TWENTY SIX WE'VE REQUESTED THAT DMV INCLUDE MILESTONES TIME LINES -- FOR EACH OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND FINDINGS. GREAT [inaudible] ARM. ONE THANK YOU SECTOR BATCH OF YOUR COMMENTS ARE APPRECIATE THE ACTING DIRECTOR FOR YOUR COMMENTS JUST GOING BACK -- TO AUDIT. AT THE OTHER TEAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR VERY -- COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT -- WHAT WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT YOU PAINT A PICTURE OF AN ORGANIZATION? THAT HAS THE INABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THINGS THROUGH IMPLEMENTED -- PROJECTS AND PUT MY IMPLEMENTED GOALS IMPLEMENT -- THE MOST -- BASIC -- OF BUSINESS PROCESSES THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION IN A CONSISTENT. MANNER IS THAT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION [inaudible] YEAH. SO SO GIVEN THAT -- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T JUST NEED. MILESTONES IN DATES BUT YOU NEED A COMPLETE OVERHAUL. OF THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE WHAT WHAT WE AGAIN. YOU KNOW THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY A REPEAT OF THE AUGUST HEARING. WE HAD A FORMER DIRECTOR WHO CAME HERE. EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID TODAY WAS SAID. IN AUGUST. THE BIG DIFFERENCES. GOING THE THE AUDITOR'S VERIFY EXACTLY WHAT WE BELIEVED THAT. WE DIDN'T TRUST THE IMPLEMENTATION. WITHIN TRUST THAT THE RESOURCES WOULD GET TO THE FIELD -- THE DMV STAFF WHO WORK HERE BECAUSE SOME MORE SOMEWHERE HERE IN AUGUST CAN ATTEST. TO THE CONSISTENCY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD. IN THE CONSISTENCY OF THE ANSWERS. ON BEHALF THE DM B. B. HERE'S WHAT WAS INCONSISTENT. WAS WHAT ACTUALLY GOT PUT INTO ACTION. SO. RATE RELATIVE TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS SO YOUR AUDITING -- WHERE IS THIS WAS HIS FAULT A FAIRLY -- CONSISTENT WITH OTHER DEFICIENCIES OR IS THIS -- YOU KNOW. WE WITH THIS WITH THIS CALL IN A FIVE ON A SCALE OF ONE TO FIVE WITH FIVE BEING -- SORT OF THE MOST -- MOST CONCERNING WITH -- ONE KIND OF BEING -- SORT OF JUST A MINOR CONCERN WHAT WE'RE WE'RE THIS FALL AND ALL THE DIFFERENT ARTISTS THAT YOU DO. IN THE STATE. THAT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER BECAUSE LIKE WE SHARED AT THE BEGINNING OUR OBJECTIVES WERE VERY NARROW FOR DMV AND EVERY TIME WE GO INTO A DIFFERENT STATE IS AGENCY WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT THINGS DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES -- BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THERE WAS SOME LEADERSHIP THAT YOU KNOW THAT I THINK THE UNDERLYING MESSAGE OF THE REPORTERS THERE WERE SOME LEADERSHIP FAILURES AND SO -- I THINK THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO SAY WELL IS THERE LEADERSHIP BETTER THAN SOMEONE ELSE'S LEADERSHIP IT WAS AT THE TIME WHEN WE ENTERED AND WE WERE LOOKING AT THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT THEY HAD IN PLACE. THAT THEIR COME AND PREVENTS COULD AND MAKE. SO SO GIVEN THAT -- THE SITUATION. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OCCURS FROM? TOP TO BOTTOM WE WE HAVE AN ACTING DIRECTOR THE CAME FOR SHE'S BEEN THERE FOR TWO MONTHS. ON HOW HOW DO WE ENSURE. ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION. AGAIN A DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE GENERALLY THE AUDITOR'S GO OUT THEY PROVIDE A REPORT THEY CITE WHAT THEY SEE BUT IT IS AT THE DEPARTMENTS DISCRETION TO IMPLEMENT OUR UP RECOMMENDATIONS. SO -- AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF TEETH TO SAY NO FULLER DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT BUT WE DO. YES SO I GET THAT SO I GUESS THE THE THE QUESTION IS IS -- AT THIS POINT THERE'S A COMPLETE LACK OF CONFIDENCE ACROSS THE BOARD. IN THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY. TO DO WHAT THEY SAY. SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP. WELL DONE IF I MAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS AB ADDED THAT THAT CHANGE WILL HAPPEN AT THE DMV. ANY STARTING OFF WITH THE TOP THE LEADERSHIP. AND AS I SAID RECRUITMENT HAS BEGUN -- FOR A NEW DIRECTOR THERE ARE OTHER VCANCIES -- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND OTHER. OTHER VACANCIES IN THE TOP LEADERSHIP -- THE GOVERNOR WILL ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT MOTIVATED -- PERSONS PERSONS WILL BE APPOINTED AND THEIR THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR NOT ONLY THE THINGS THAT THE STRIKE TEAM. IS IS -- DEVELOPING BUT ALSO TO THE TO AS YOU SAID THIS EXTREMELY THOROUGH AUDIT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID. SO SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORDS THAT THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT HERE'S WHAT'S MISSING. THEY'LL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO WHAT. TWO TWO AND IN MAKING THE MANY IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE AUDIT HAS HAS -- IDENTIFIED THINGS THAT THE STRIKE FORCE HAS IDENTIFIED AND HAS ALREADY TAKEN. INTO ACCOUNT AND IS WORKING ON% HERE BECAUSE A PROBLEM EVEN IN YOUR OWN SPEECH I GIVE YOU SOME LATITUDE BECAUSE IT WAS A LITTLE BIT LONG I AM CALLING -- AND ALSO TO THE DIRECTOR SPEECH WAS EXCESSIVELY LONG THERE WERE -- THINGS THAT WERE MISSING. SO THEN WHAT WHAT WAS MISSING WAS DATA [inaudible] FAX TIMELINE BENCHMARKS PERFORMANCE MEASURES SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. TO DETERMINE. OR TO HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE. THERE WAS NO WE'RE GONNA REDUCE WE TIMES BY THIS MUCH THIS IS HOW MANY CUTS WAS WE'RE GOING TO SERVE WE'RE GONNA. YOU KNOW IT TOOK. SEVEN MONTHS TO ROLL OUT WHY FIGHT TO THE EXTERNAL. OF ONE D. M. V. FIELD OFFICE. HOW MANY FIELD OFFICES ARE THEY'RE PRETTY IN THE? SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO SO BASED ON THAT PAGE HOW MANY YEARS WOULD IT TAKE TO ROLL OUT EVERY SINGLE ONE I DON'T THINK THAT WILL DO THEM SOME SEQUENTIALLY -- BUT BUT BUT I A WEALTH BUT BUT I GET THE FEELING. BUT I'M JUST SAYING THE POINT IS IN AUGUST WE DISCUSS THIS ISSUE. THIS WAS A MAJOR PRIORITY HOW LONG ARE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE WE ARE ASSURED WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA -- WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS BETTER FASTER. SO SEVEN MONTHS LATER WE FOUND OUT. ONLY ONE IN CARMICHAEL HAS BEEN DONE. SO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW LONG PEOPLE I MEAN SO THE WAIT TIMES ARE DOWN HER. THE CALCULATION BUT WE DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW THE WAIT TIMES ARE DOWN BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW. AGAIN THE THE THE PEOPLE IN MY AREA. STAR WAITING IN LINE LIKE AT FIVE AM. AT SIX AM SOLD FOR THE THREE HOURS THAT THEY WERE IN LINE. BEFORE MAYBE THIS THREE OR FOUR HOURS THEIR ONLINE BEFORE THE STAFF EVEN GET THERE GUESS WHAT. THAT'S NOT HELD. THAT'S STILL TIME OUT OF THERE SO SO I I MEAN I'M TRYING. TO BE UNDERSTANDING AND UNFORTUNATELY -- I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT SO YOU JUST HAVE ME BUT THIS BUDGET REQUEST CANNOT WILL NOT BE APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE. HAS THIS. THERE ARE NO MEASUREMENTS THERE'S NO YOU'RE ASKING FOR A BUDGET INCREASE AFTER THIS AUDIT WHICH POINTS OUT FLAWS TO EVERY SINGLE PART. O. V. DEPARTMENT. ON TOP OF THAT IT DOES EVEN IN THIS IS AND WE'VE A GOT TO AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. SO HOW HOW CAN [inaudible] THIS PROPOSAL. WHAT FORWARD IN THIS FASHION? WITHOUT ANY WAYS SO HOW HOW WAS THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PROVE THIS WITH THE TRUST US WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. HOW HOW CAN ANYBODY ELSE FOR THAT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT? I'M A I'M A LITTLE BIT IN SHOCK BECAUSE WE MET YESTERDAY MY OFFICE OKAY WE HAVE A PLAN WE HAVE PRESENTATION. SO AGAIN. NO FAX NO DATA. NO PLAN. ALL I HAVE IS A LINE ITEM. TO TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. I'M SORRY. TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH IT RIGHT. WHERE THEY DON'T? WHERE THEY DO IT? TO THE OTHER THE OTHER PART THE AUDIT MENTION WAS THERE THEY'RE NOT EVEN BEING TROUT THE GONNA BE TRAINED THE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. IS THERE IS THERE COUNTER SPACE AT EACH THE FIELD OFFICES TO DO THIS ARE THERE ENOUGH COMPUTERS. FOR THE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. SO WHAT ARE THESE TO THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE DOING. I I THINK THE FOLLOWING PANEL IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED -- AND UPDATING THE BUDGET -- LOOK LET ME JUST CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH MY AUDIT QUESTIONS IF THAT'S OKAY HE THE FIRST. HOW DO THEY RESOLVE THE PLANNING? AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES. HOW HOW HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT THAT DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE? HOW TO PRIORITIZE HOW DO YOU TEACH THEM HOW TO PRACTICE? SORRY CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE EXAMPLE OF THE RELY D. I. T. PROJECT PRIORITIZATION. OUTLINED PRACTICES THAT WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT OTHER STATE ENTITIES -- REGARDING USING METRICS TO PRIORITIZE PROJECTS. CAN HAVING CONSISTENCY AND HOW THEY DO THAT DO YOU WANT TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE [inaudible] SURE. SO. OUR REPORT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALL SUMMER AS AN APPENDIX C. OF OUR REPORT WHICH I BELIEVE WAS ALSO AN ATTACHMENT TO THE AGENDA TODAY. TOWARDS THE END FOR FINDING TO POINT TO A WE TALK ABOUT REVIEWING HOW. THE IN THE PRIORITIZE THEIR PROJECTS AND EXCUSES ACCEPTED SCORING AND RANKING TABLETS TO DO SO. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THEY HAVE A SYSTEMATIC SCORING SYSTEM FOR THEIR I. T. PROJECT SO THAT THEY CAN -- HAVE A UNIFORM METHOD FOR PRIORITIZING DIFFERENT THINGS AS THEY COME ACROSS THEIR TO DO LIST -- WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THEY REFINE THEIR EXISTING TEMPLATE SO THAT THEY ALIGN WITH THAT SYSTEMATIC SCORING SYSTEM. AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THEY USE THEIR EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT'S COUNSEL TO ADVISE THEM ON WHAT. PROJECTS ARE FACING DMB. SO SUGGEST TO SECRETARY ROGER SO WHO WHO ON THE DMV TEAMS BEEN ASSIGNED THIS. WHEREAS THERE'S AN ASSEMBLY LINE ANSWER TO THE AUDIT YES. THE THE REST OF THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATION WAS TO ASSIGN A DEDICATED TEAM. TO TO ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RELY T. BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT PROPER PRIORITIZATION OF FUTURE PROJECTS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS ACTING DIRECTOR WEB IS -- HAS ASSIGNED ALREADY EIGHT EIGHTEEN THAT IS PUTTING TOGETHER THE RESPONSE TO THE TO THE AUDIT. AND I'M ASSUMING IT IS OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM -- THEY COUNSEL THAT WAS JUST REFER. TO I'VE ASKED HER WHAT IF THEY PUT A PLANNING DOCUMENT TOGETHER I DIDN'T ASK -- IT IT IT HAD BEEN ASSIGNED. TO I SHOULD SAY TO HOME. IN TERMS OF ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE -- YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU. PLAN TO HAVE BETTER ALIGNMENT BETWEEN CENTRAL OFFICE IN THE FIELD OFFICES. WHAT WAS THE RECOMMENDATION THERE? SO FOR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE WE LOOKED AT THE DIVISION AND THE SPREAD OF THEIR REGIONAL OFFICES THAT OVERSEE THE FIELD OFFICES -- AND AS WE SAY IN THE REPORT. THERE ARE CONSTRAINTS ON THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE REGIONAL OFFICES AND THEN THE QUANTITY. OF REGIONAL OFFICES WITH RESPECT TO THE FIELD OFFICES THERE'S EIGHT REGIONS AND OVER A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIELD OFFICES. SO -- WE RECOMMEND DMV. ANALYZE THEIR MAKE UP A FIELD OFFICES IN AND IN ADDITION TO REASSESS THE GRADING. OF FIELD OFFICES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE ADEQUATE LEVEL OF SUPPORT -- BUT THE OVERALL I I GUESS JUST A STEP BACK I UNDERSTAND YOUR HONOR WAS WAS VERY SPECIFIC RIGHT TO STEP BACK TO THE OVERALL PICTURE. YOU PAINTED WAS AN AGENCY SOMEWHAT UNDER SIEGE FROM FOR LACK OF FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD. AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS SORT OF ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE JUST DOING TO INSPECT EVERY DAY BUT DOESN'T STOP AND ACTUAL PLAN AND IMPLEMENT -- DIRECTIVES ORDERS A STEP BACK AND ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT KIND OF WATER WHAT WE KNOW. NOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO TODAY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BIG THINGS COMING DOWN THE PIKE. SO HOW DO YOU GET AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT TO ACTUALLY. STOP NOT JUST TO WORK EVERY DAY BUT ACTUALLY. SIT BACK AND PLAN. WHAT I THINK IT GOES BACK TO THE LEADERSHIP THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS THAT IF THEY HAVE A STRONG LEADERSHIP -- GUIDING THEM THROUGH WHATEVER. THREE THIS AND THEIR VISION -- SO. THERE WAS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE SACRAMENTO HEADQUARTERS AND THE FIELD OFFICES AND SO WE RECOMMENDED IN OUR REPORT HAT THERE BE A BETTER. ALIGNMENT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THOSE. TWO MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THE SACRAMENT HEADQUARTERS. I DO NOT HAVE THAT NUMBER APPROXIMATELY. I MEAN I GUESS THREE THOUSAND I I DON'T I REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER EITHER. IN IN OF THE THREE THOUSAND HE SAID THERE'S A LEADERSHIP VACUUM ON AND THE GOVERNMENT'S VACUUM AS WELL. AND HOW MANY PEOPLE AT THE TOP OR ARE ARE THERE. PARDON HOW MANY PEOPLE AT THE TOP AND CERTAINLY THE NAP LEVY DIRECTOR BILL ROUGHLY LIKE WHAT. SIXTEEN TWENTY EXCELLENT LATEST CHANGED SINCE WE'VE BEEN THERE. LIKE WHAT TWELVE I BELIEVE THERE'S EIGHT DIVISIONS AND SO BE AS MUCH OF IT BUT YOU HAVE A TEN YEAH RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL DIRECT REPORTS INTO THE THE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE LIKE PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND SO FORTH. SO IT'S WE HAVE A COUPLE VACANCIES I KNOW THAT RIGHT. BUT WITHIN THEIR THEY'RE STILL. TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL THERE [inaudible] SO HOW. HOW DO YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED FROM THE FIELD OFFICES AND RECONNECT THEM? YOUR YOUR AND YOUR ANSWERED EVERYTHING IS IS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I REALLY -- THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP HAS TO RUN THE SHIP AND IF AT RISK IF OF RUNS AGROUND IT'S THE CAPTAIN'S CAPTAINS RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT WHICH IS WHICH IS WHY MY MY POINT IS IT'S HARD TO DO IT. 25% BUDGET AUGMENTATION WHEN THERE'S NOT CLEAR LEADERSHIP. NOT CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY. NOT CLEAR BENCHMARKS NOT CLEAR GUIDELINES NOT CLEAR TIMELINE IT'S NOT CLEAR. RIGHT THIS IS I MEAN THIS IS NOT UP POLICY COMMITTEE THIS IS BUDGET COMMITTEE. IN A BUDGET COMMITTEE WE PREFER TO DO THINGS AND DATA. AND WHAT I HEARD TODAY WAS A LOT OF TALK BUT NOT A LOT OF DATA OR FAX. SO I MADE TO THE TOM EXCUSE THE THE HONORS BECAUSE WE'LL GET TO THE NEXT PART. BUT BID WHAT CAN REALLY APPRECIATE. AUDIT I MEAN I THINK I THINK THE ON IT WAS VERY VERY WELL DONE VERY THOROUGH REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR YOUR JOB I KNOW -- THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING. HOUSE YOU ARE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF COMPLETING ABLE TO ANSWER ALL OF THEM BUT HAVING SAID THAT I THINK. THE AUDIT PAINTS A VERY CLEAR PICTURE OF THE DEFICIENCIES. I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S NOT CLEAR IS. WHO'S GOING. TO AGAIN BE ACCOUNTABLE. TO CORRECT THEM. AND WHO DO WE HAVE CONFIDENCE AND TO APPROPRIATE THE RESOURCES AND GIVE THE UNIVERSE. WHO WHO WHO'S GONNA BE THERE TO RESTORE THE PUBLIC TRUST? SO THANK YOU THANK YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA PANEL THREE NOW IN -- NOT. OKAY THANK YOU AS A TRAVESTY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FREEDOM BY DIRECT WEB YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO BEGIN OR SECRETARY PATRICK. SO -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- AGAIN CAPPING WEB ACTING DIRECTOR IN I WOULD POSE A QUESTION I CAN GO INTO HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO INTO QUESTIONS ON THE ESSENCE OF TIME. YOU CAN DO A VERY. HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY YOU WISH ALL RIGHT. SO FOR THE CURRENT YEAR TO REQUESTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE PERSON TO PERSON TO OF THE BUDGET ACT. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO AUGMENT DMV'S FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET -- THAT AMOUNT IS FORTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION TO PREVENT INCREASED WAIT TIMES AND REALLY ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY THE REAL ID DEMANDS THAT WE HAVE. THE THORNY WOULD FUND CURRY ACOSTA SAYS THEY WITH INCREASED HOURS OF OPERATION OVER TIME INCREASED PERMANENT PI HOURS. USE OF RETIRED ANNUITANTS THE STAFF BORROWED FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND STAFF TRAINING. THIS FUND. THIS WILL ALSO FROM THE EARLY HIRING OF TRADING THREE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL TRUMP TEMPORARY POSITIONS BEEN REQUESTED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET -- ALONG WITH THE EARLY HIRING TV IS REQUESTING A MILLION DOLLARS IN CURRENT YEAR FOR AN INSERVICE TRAINING DAY WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO BASICALLY BASELINE AND EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH OUR SIMPLE MANY REAL ID -- AND IS ALSO BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS IN COORDINATION WITH THE COVER UPS RIGHT TEAM. THIS WILL BE CRITICAL TO ENSURE I THINK THAT CONSISTED OF DELIVERY THAT YOU'VE BEEN ALL TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGET YOUR TOTAL REQUEST. IS FOR TWENTY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION TO FUND A HUNDRED SEVENTY POINT EIGHT PERMANENT. ADDRESS SHORT TERM CHALLENGES ALONG WITH LONG TERM OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BOUNCES IMMEDIATE NEEDS FOR TEMPORARY RESOURCES TO ADDRESS REAL ID. WITH THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES BUT ALSO -- REALLY ADDRESSING WHAT I CALL SYSTEMIC -- AND INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS AT DMV. IN RESPONSE TO THE OFF THE STATE ALSO VALUATIONS PERFORMANCE REVIEW -- AND THE GOV UP TO YOU THE DMV REINVENTION TEAM THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING FOR THE NUMBER OF LONG TERM PROGRAMS THAT WILL TRANSFORM DMV FOR THE BETTER. THESE NEED A CUSTOMER FOR WAS WILL INCLUDE ACCEPTING CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS THE FIELD OFFICES OFFICES WHICH WILL MAKE TRANSACTIONS FASTER AND EASIER. ALSO INCLUDES PASSING ON THE CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION FEES TO THE CUSTOMER SIMILAR TO THE EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WHICH WILL REDUCE OVERALL EXPENDITURES FOR THE DMV. AND GENERATE BUDGETARY SAVINGS OF A HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT FOR OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THE REDESIGN IS STREAMLINING OF THE DMV'S WEBSITE IS REALLY ESSENTIAL AND WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO COMPLETE TRACK TRANSACTIONS ONLINE REDUCE UNNECESSARY. FIELD OFFICE VISITS -- INCLUSIVE IN THE REQUESTED SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS AN EMAIL ADDRESS FOR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE ENQUIRIES SOMETHING YOU WOULD THINK WE COULD DO ALREADY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WILL ALSO REQUIRE RESOURCES FOR D. V. TO APPROPRIATELY STAFF AND READ AND BE RESPONSIVE. TO THE PROPOSAL ALSO FUND A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS BESIDES TRAINING INCREASE RANCH REGIONAL MAN FROM PROVIDER SIDE OF THE FIELD OFFICE OPERATIONS TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE ENSURE THE TRAINEES IMPLEMENTED CONSISTENTLY. WE ALSO WANT TO BRING AID -- CONSULTANT DMV TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE DESPERATELY NEEDED AT DMV AND TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO BETTER CORDY AND MANAGE RESOURCES ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION. MY GOAL ALSO WITH REGARD TO THIS REQUEST IS TO ESTABLISH A PERFORMANCE OF MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT. THAT INCLUDES KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THERE ARE TIED TO STRATEGIC PLANS AND THE OPERATING GOALS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE -- IN ADDITION WE ARE SEEKING A MILLION DOLLARS FOR A VENDOR TO HELP REDESIGN IS STREAMLINED THE DMV FIELD OFFICE FOR THE FUTURE WE THEN WOULD CONDUCT A FIELD OFFICE THE PILOT THAT DMV OFFICE OF THE FUTURE. AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY PLANS TO EXPAND TRANSACTIONS THAT CUSTOMERS COMPLETE ON ITS WEBSITE CIVIL SERVICE TERMINAL HE ALSO CUSTOMERS DO NOT NEED TO VISIT A FIELD OFFICE. AT THE REQUEST ALSO PROVIDES FOR CRITICAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING REPLACEMENT OF OUTDATED UNRELIABLE HARDWARE. SUCH AS TERMINAL SERVICES CIRCUITS AND EXPANDED NETWORK REDUNDANCIES TO STABILIZE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M DIEM FOR THE DMV BELIEVES THE CUSTOMER OUT REGION EDUCATION IS A KEY COMPONENT I KNOW I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME. RIPPLES INCLUDES NINE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN FOR VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS AIMED AT REDUCING WAIT TIMES TO BETTER PERFORM AND INFORM THE PUBLIC -- I THINK THE END OF THE DAY I JUST WANT TO REASSURE HER THAT THERE ARE SOME SHORT TERM NEEDS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO ADDRESSED TO ADDRESS REAL ID BUT THERE ARE TRULY SOME LONG TERM SYSTEMIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES THAT WERE ALSO ADDRESSING. THANK YOU FINANCE. BRIEFLY SINCE THIS IS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AT LIKE TO ADDRESS -- A NUMBERS ISSUE THE AGENDA DOES SAY TWO AND FORTY TWO AND THAT IS THE TOTAL ASK WITH AND BE A THE TWO TWENTY FIVE THE DIRECTOR. REFERENCE IS ALSO ACCURATE WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REDUCTION FROM OTHER FUNDS RELATED TO PASSING FOR THE CREDIT CARD. FEES SO IT THERE ARE MANY NUMBERS AROUND THE SUPPOSED DEPENDING ON WHICH ASPECT YOU ARE LOOKING AT THANK. THANK YOU ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE L.. QUESTION TO THE COMMITTEE. SO I HAVE A QUESTION WHICH LEADS OVER FROM FROM THE THE PRIOR PANEL AND AND NOW WITH ACTING DIRECTOR AND AND THE HEAD OF THE STRIKE TEAM HERE. NO I THE ENVIRONMENT I COME FROM IS PUBLIC EDUCATION SENATE SERVE NINE YEARS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. AND OVER THE LAST DECADE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE HONORED UNDERGONE TREMENDOUS STATE MANDATED TRANSFORMATION WE'VE GONE ON TO A NEW COMMON CORE SET OF STANDARDS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT TESTING WHICH MEANT THAT EVERY STUDENT HAD TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR HAND IN ORDER. TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE ASSESSMENTS IN A VERY SHORT TIME WINDOW THAT WAS PROVIDED. TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. DISTRICTS ROSE TO THAT CHALLENGE IN A DIMINISHED FUNDING ENVIRONMENT RIGHT THERE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SCHOOL FUNDING TO REALLY RESOURCE WHAT ALL OF THE NEEDS ARE. AND SO I'M LEFT AT THE END OF THESE THREE PANELS CONVERSATION SAYING IS THE LEADERSHIP CHANGE THAT'S NEEDED. A DEVOLVING A DMB LEADERSHIP TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE AT THIS POINT TO SHIFT THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO LOCAL LEADERSHIP AND INSTITUTIONS WHERE THERE'S A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE CONSTITUENTS BEING SERVED AND THEREFORE A REAL TIME NEED TO ACTUALLY MAKE THESE CHANGES HAPPEN. BECAUSE I AM I JUST BEING HERE IN FEW HOURS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE TODAY IN THE FEW MONTHS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE CAPITAL THE DMV IS MY SINGLE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION AND I'M A PROBLEM SOLVER. AND I'M STILL NOT HEARING A COUPLE OF HOURS IN HOW WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS I HEAR A RE FRAMING OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE BUT I AM NOT HEARING A ROAD MAP FOR HOW WE FIX IT. AND IN MANY CASES WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GOOD GOVERNMENT SERVICE THE BEST. MODEL TO PROVIDE THAT. IS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO SHARE TO ME YOUR CONCEPT OF WHAT THE NEW. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE I WANT SOME MEASURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN MY DISTRICT THAT I CAN GO TO DIRECTLY NOW TO GET THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED -- YOUR READERS THAT FROM NOW ON YOU MAY HAVE SOME THOUGHTS YOU WANT TO SHARE. I'M. SO. GREAT QUESTION IN ONE OF THESE I WILL TELL YOU THAT -- IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT I AM A BIG ADVOCATE OF WHAT THEY CALL THE BALANCED SCORECARD IT SOUNDS LIKE THE SCHOOLS WERE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES -- AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANY ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS ONE OF THE PRIMARY GOALS FOR SERVING YOUR CUSTOMERS AND ONE OF THE METRICS YOU NEED TO BE PUTTING IN PLACE. AND THEN YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE TO ENSURE YOU HAVE WHAT I CALL HORIZONTAL -- ENTERPRISE FOCUS OF HOW RICH EVEN BECAUSE ONE IS I FIND INTERESTING AND GOVERNMENT. IS THE PROGRAMS GET GOING BUT THERE IS SOMETIMES AND THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ACTUALLY ON IT ON THE SAME TEAM TOGETHER A PART OF WHAT I NEED TO DO IS AT DMV IS MAKE SURE THERE'S A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING. OF OUR MISSION OUR VISION OUR CUSTOMERS THE GOALS WERE ALL TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE ROLE THAT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN ALIGNED WITH THE WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY. HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY -- FACILITIES MAN FOR SOUNDS LIKE HOW DO THOSE GOALS ALIGNED WITH ACTUALLY DELIVERING SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. BUT IT ALL STARTS WITH A STRONG ENTERPRISE GOVERNANCE TEAM AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE EXECUTIVES THE DEPUTIES ALL LINED AND MEASURING AND HOLDING EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE. BECAUSE I ALSO THINK IT'S HOLDING EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE TO ACHIEVING THE GOALS BUT I THINK EVEN MOST IMPORTANTLY YOU'VE ALL STRESSES AND I I COMPLETELY AGREE IN I KNOW SECRETARY AGREES AS WELL. AS WE DO NEED TO PUT OUT A PERFORMANCE MANAGER REPORT NOW I I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT A REPORT ON A MONTHLY BASIS -- THAT TALKS ABOUT THE INITIAL WAIT TIMES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I WOULD OFFER AND I'VE TALKED TO SOME OF THE BUDGET STAFF THAT WE RE VISIT THE REPORT THAT WE GIVE TO YOU ON A MONTHLY BASIS. AND THAT WE AGREED TO ONE OF THE KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON TO ADDRESS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES. BUT ALSO ASSURE YOU GOOD STEWARDSHIP OF THE FUNDS THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY. GIVING TO US I OFTENTIMES TELL MY STAFF TO THOSE WHO ARE GIVEN MUCH MUCH IS EXPECTED. AND I THINK YOU HAVE A FAIR FAIR REQUEST TO EXPECT US TO REPORT TO YOU -- ON THOSE EFFORTS -- WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IT'S A CULTURE THAT'S EXISTED FOR A LONG PERIOD TIME IN THE WAY THAT ARE CURRENTLY OPERATES? SO WHAT I DO AND WHAT WE GO IN WITH THE GOV UP STRIKE TEAM ISN'T GOING TO JUST TURN IT AROUND ON A DIME THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE A FULL EFFORT THAT ADDRESS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THE DRESS IS BUSINESS PROCESS DEVELOPMENT. DRESSES TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMATION IN ADDITION TO REALLY KIND OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS THE BUSINESS MODEL FOR THE DMV GOING FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW IF INCORPORATES WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT UP. BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME GOOD DISCUSSIONS WE CAN HAVE IS WHAT IS THE RIGHT BUSINESS MODEL FOR DMV IN CALIFORNIA ON A GO FORWARD BASIS. SECRETARY VETERAN DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT NO I I I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'VE SAID AND I ALSO AGREE MISTER CHAIRMAN. THAT -- METRICS AND AND SOME BENCHMARKS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND NEEDED -- WE WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT A LARGER ORGANIZATIONAL AND REVIEW AT THE STRIKE TEAM WE HAVE LEFT OPERATIONAL STATISTICS -- TO WE KNEW THEY ON IT WOULD BE -- FORTHCOMING ON THOSE THINGS AS WELL AS THE DMV BUT I DO AGREE THAT METRICS ARE IN VERY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WILL COME FORTH WITH THEM WITH THE METRICS THAT WE NEED. ON THE GOVERNANCE. STRUCTURE BOTH BOTH SPECIFIC IN CERTAIN AREAS OF DMV THE I. T. AREA IN PARTICULAR. AS WELL AS THE OVER ALL EXECUTIVE TEAM I'M IS LACKING AND HAS BEEN LACKING -- I CAN'T ADDRESS THE REASONS AS TO WHY -- BUT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS GOING FORWARD -- FIXING THOSE THINGS AND HAVING THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WE HAVE STATED. AS WELL AS THE RIGHT STRUCTURE THAT INDEED DOES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THOSE FIELD OFFICES ARE CRITICAL THEY ARE. SMALL LITTLE CITIES AND TO THEMSELVES DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT STRUCTURE AS I THINK ACTING DIRECTOR WEB SAID EARLIER. ALL OF THE FIELD OFFICES ARE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT AND WHEN THEY'VE BEEN BUILT I MEAN THE PHIL OFFICE IN SAN FRANCISCO IS EXTREMELY DIFFERENT THEN THE DALY CITY. THEN -- AND THOSE THAT ARE IT MORE MODERNIZED AND THEY THEY LACK TRAINING ROOMS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN STUDIED IN TERMS OF THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE THROUGH THEM -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE WE'VE. BEEN WORKING WITH MACKENZIE ON IS HOW DO YOU AND OPERATE WITHIN THE SPACE WHEN THE SPACE IS VERY DIFFERENT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE THE THE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE IF THEY HAVE -- CHAIRS THERE FOR THEM THEY'RE LITERALLY SITTING THERE LOOKING AT AT THE FUNCTIONING OF DMV THE INEFFICIENCIES BEFORE THEM WINDOWS OPEN IN SO FOURTH WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW PEOPLE FLOW THROUGH THESE OFFICES. AND ON COME UP WITH A MUCH BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT PLAN -- FOR FOR ALL OF THE DMV'S IF YOU WILL BUT LOCAL -- CONTROL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND LOCAL OUR CONCERN IS NATION'S GETTING THE PROPER TRAINING. DO WE HAVE THE PROPER AND STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF HAVE THE REGION'S ALLOCATED PROPERLY ARE THEY AS THE AUDIT DONE WELL INDICATED -- I THINK COLLEEN'S LOOKING VERY CLOSELY THROUGH THE THROUGH THAT AND TO THAT -- I THINK THE AUDIT POINTED OUT WELL THAT THE THE REGIONS AND THE DM B. FIELD OFFICES HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT AND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY WE ADVANCE GREATLY IN HOW WE PERFORMED WORK. HAVE THOSE PROCESSES THAT THEY PERFORMED IN LIKE THAT AND THOSE ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO HAVE DONE NOW. THE SPEECH IN OURS. I THINK WHEN SO ONE RECURRING THEME IN OUR CONVERSATION HAS BEEN I THINK SOME CONCERN ABOUT. A LACK OF A CLEAR READ MATH AND A LACK OF SEEMING LACK OF CLEAR DELIVER ALSO. JUST GOING BACK TO I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT FIVE OR LIKE I'M TAKING A THAT THERE'S LIKE FIVE HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS. REAL ID OVERALL TECH REMEDIATION AND REDEVELOPMENT ONLINE CALL CENTERS AND KIOSK ROLLOUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE FIVE SO FOR EACH OF THOSE IS THERE RIGHT NOW TODAY A DOCUMENTED PROJECT PLAN. THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO TO SHARE WITH US FOR EACH OF THOSE FIVE PROJECTS. SO WE DO HAVE A PLAN AND I THINK. WHAT I WOULD OFFER IS I THINK? WE OWE YOU PROBABLY A MORE FORMALIZED PLAN AROUND WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THE TIME ONCE AROUND THOSE THINGS. FOR EACH OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED I HAVE INDIVIDUAL PLANS THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH -- I THINK IT'S KIND OF BRINGING THEM INTO PROBABLY A THE DMV REPORT THAT KINDA HOLISTICALLY BRINGS THOSE THINGS TOGETHER I'M NOT I'M FINE WITH THAT AGAIN CHARTING I LIKE AGAIN CHART RIGHT. YEAH I AGREE I CAN SPEAK AT LEAST TO THE THE ONE OF THE AREAS AS AN EXAMPLE THE KIOSKS I'VE MET WITH THE VENDOR THE I. T. I. -- AND ASKED THEM NOT ONLY FOR A COMMUNICATIONS PLAN WHICH THEY HAVE PUT TOGETHER BUT FOR A REVIEW OF THEIR METHODOLOGY WHAT HOW DO THEY DECIDE WHERE KIOSKS GO. AND REVIEW OF THEIR MEDIA AT METHODOLOGIES AND A PLAN AS TO WHERE THEY WOULD PUT THE HUNDRED THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR AS WELL AS A PLUS. ONE HUNDRED THAT WE HOPE TO HAVE OUT IN THE FIELD -- BY THE END IS THE END OF THE YEAR AND I UNDERSTAND COLEEN THAT THEY ARE PUTTING THAT TOGETHER. SO -- THAT IS AT AT A PLAN FOR THE KIOSKS BOTH A RECHECK OF THEIR METHODOLOGY WHERE BEST TO WE PLACES CARIASO A REVIEW OF WHETHERTHEY'RE APPROPRIATE STILL THAT. HAVE MORE IN THE IN THE DMV OFFICES WHICH DRIVE TRAFFIC INTO THE FIELD OFFICE WHICH IS AGAIN NOT ONE OF OUR GOALS. SO THAT IS ONE OF THE PLANS AROUND ON AROUND THE KIOSKS ERA. AS AN EXAMPLE. AND I WON'T SPEAK I'M YEAH I WANT TO FOR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE OR THE CHAIR BUT I THINK THAT. YES I VIçT LIKE VERY CLEAR PLANS WITH CLEAR. DELIVERABLES FOR EACH OF THOSE FIVE I THINK WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO GETTING PEOPLE COMFORTABLE WITH. YOU'RE MAKING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OR AT LEAST BEING ABLE TO TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE [inaudible] THIS FALL. BUT I JUST. SOME QUICK QUESTIONS AND SEE THAT THERE ARE -- THE STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ARE AT LIVING WITH ID WHAT. WHAT STATES ARE DOING IT WELL? CALLING YOU JUST CAME FROM THE NATIONAL. YOU KNOW THAT'S A FASCINATING QUESTION TO ASK -- I THINK I AM CALLING JUST CAME FROM A NATIONAL -- ASSOCIATION MEETING WHERE THIS WAS MUCH TALKED MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATORS AROUND THE COUNTRY. SO I I'M I'M I'M THEN I'M ALL YEARS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND ME WITH FIFTY DIFFERENT. STATE FOR THE DIFFERENT DMV'S. WHO'S DOING IT WELL. THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION -- I I'VE HAD I TRIED AT S. TWO TWO EASY QUESTIONS YEAH YOU KNOW I LOVE I LOVE IT AND HAVE A LOT OF CONTACT WITH THE STATE OF INDIANA I THINK THAT THEY REALLY KIND OF WELL. THEY HAVE AN AS SECRETARY FACTORS AND ACTING DIRECTOR WHAT. THEIR PRIMARY GOAL HAS AGAIN. TO REALLY GET FOLKS OUT DO NOT COME IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO THEY'VE DEVELOPED SOME. A WONDERFUL CONNECTS CENTERS VERY SIMILAR TO AND I CAPITOL ONE CAFE. VERY HIGH TECH SILICON VALLEY WHERE YOU CAN GO IN THERE IT'S THIS MAN BY ONE PERSON AND IT'S GOT KIOSK IN THE WALL AND YOU COULD YOU KNOW ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS SO? I THINK THEY DO THAT WHILE THEIR WEBSITE IS FANTASTIC. I AM I ATTENDED ONE OF THEIR CONFERENCES ON CALL CENTER IT SAT CALL CENTER CENTER CITY. OF WE SHARE THAT WITH OUR COMMUNICATION PROGRAMS DIVISION I THINK THAT THEY'VE ALL DONE I THINK INDIANA HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE LEARN FROM THE OTHER STATES AS WELL SO WE'VE GOT OUR FRIENDS IN TEXAS ARE MANDATORY REAL ID LEARNING FROM BAD ABOUT. YOUR VENDORS YOU'RE KIDDING YOU KNOW YOU'RE QUEUING SYSTEM HAVE YOU TRIAGE PEOPLE SO I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW WE LEARN FROM ALL DIFFERENT SOURCES BUT FROM MY PARTICULARLY I THINK INDIANA DOESN'T VERY WELL. I I'D ECHO THE THE REVIEW THAT WE'VE MADE OF DIFFERENT STATES -- AS A STRIKE TEAM INDIANA HAS DONE SOME SUPERB THINGS YEARS AGO THEY OFFLOADED IF YOU WILL THEIR VEHICLE REGISTRATION OUTSIDE OF FIELD OFFICES SO THEY'VE MADE SOME STATUTORY CHANGES TO WHAT IS -- WHAT IS UTILIZED WHATEVER FIELD OFFICES UTILIZED FOR THEIR THE OPPOSITE COOLEY WAS JUST REFERRING TO IS VERY MUCH A DMB OF THE FUTURE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HOPE TO LOOK AT? IN AND ARE WITH THE ARE IF TO THAT WE HAVE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER AND IT'S A IT'S A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN D. M. V. THAT AS SHE DESCRIBED. YOU HAVE KIOSKS AND IN THE WALL SERVICES LIKE AN ATM AND EIGHT ONE PERSON CAN STAFF THIS IT'S IT IT IT. IT TODD AND IT LOOKS LIKE FRANKLY AN APPLE STORE IT'S A VERY INVITING ENVIRONMENT AND PEOPLE CAN -- USE IT AT ONE AM IN THE MORNING A ONE PM IN THE AFTERNOON SO ARE WE LOOKING. I GUESS TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL ABSOLUTELY SO AND AND SO THAT IS PART OF THE DISCUSSION I GUESS AND IN THIS PLAN THAT WE'RE GONNA GET IS IS THAT LONG TERM VISION OF OF THESE KIOSKS AND AND A LOT OF THEM GUESSING THAT WE DON'T WOULD. INDEED ALL THE STE THE EDITION ALL TEMPORARY STAFF. AND WE UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY IS IT MY CORRECT. WELL AND DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT YES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS STRIKE TEAM IS LOOKING AT IS NOT ONLY A IN THE AND I'D LIKE -- TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SERVICE AND DMV BUT A WHOLE A WHOLE NEW DESIGN DMV WHERE -- PEOPLE ARE SERVICED OR PEOPLE ARE SERVED AND PEOPLE FLOW THROUGH AN OFFICE IN -- A MATCH NEW MODERN WAY AND OUR SERVICE IN TERMS OF HOW HOW HOW THEY ARE AND EITHER UTILIZING THE TECHNICIAN HOW THEY'RE UTILIZING. THINGS LIKE SELF SERVICE SURE SO WE HAVE ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IS INDEED A FOR A R. F. Q. TO HAVE A VENDOR. PUT INDEED THAT PLAN TOGETHER -- FOUR EIGHT FUTURE DMV SO SO WHAT'S YOUR TIME LINE I MEAN I MEAN THERE THERE ARE VENDORS I'M SURE THAT COULD GET COULD DO WHAT THE REGISTRATIONS THAT COULD DO RENEWAL AS THEY COULD -- YOU COULD WE COULD DO TO YEAR -- LICENSE RENEWALS SO WHERE THE FOLKS ON THE COME IN EVERY YEAR -- MAIL WHAT IS YOUR TIMELINE AND MEET THEIR INTEREST RATE SPECIFICALLY BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING FOREVER IN THE FOR THE GOP I'M AND I THINK YOU HIT THE STREET NEXT WEEK WELL FOR EVERYTHING SO THE A MAN GUESSING YOU'RE GONNA TRIAGE WHAT YOU GOT. WE ATTEMPTING TO AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA DO A TIER ONE TIER TWO TIER TWO PRIORITIES TRYING TO GET AT SOME POINT. YOU KNOW I WOULD I THINK THAT FOR US IN THE LEGISLATURE WE THINK TO SHORT TERM SO LET'S GO OUT. TWENTY YEARS AND GO AND WORK BACKWARDS SO HOW FAST CAN WE GET THERE AS WE ARE WHAT ARE THE MILESTONES YOU THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO KINDA. PULL SOME INFORMATION FROM YOU IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU ENVISION. AND CHANGING THE DMV MODERNIZING THE DMV AND HOW FAST CAN WE GET THERE. WELL ON WITHTHE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE APPROPRIATION THAT WERE ASKING FOR SOME OF THE THINGS IN TERMS OF THE MODERNIZATION AND THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. DEPEND ON OF COURSE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE -- IN TERMS OF OF DMB OF THE FUTURE THAT'S SOMETHING HOPEFULLY THAT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY OPPORTUNITIES -- TO WITH NEW RELEASES COMING DO WITH -- SOME LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT ALLOWS -- DMV'S TO ACTUALLY CONSIDER I'M TRANSFERRING AND EXCHANGING LAND I THINK SAN FRANCISCO IS IS ONE IN THE LEGISLATION RANCHO CUCAMONGA. AND SAN DIEGO AND THAT'S THAT'S AGAIN -- IN A PLAN THAT WOULD COULD BE IMPLEMENTED LITERALLY IN THE IN THE NEXT YEAR. THERE ARE MANY MORE TIME FRAMES THAT WEEK WEEK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I THINK WE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT A VERY IMPORTANT. ROAD MAP. IS WHAT WILL BE DUE AT THE END OF MAY AND THAT IS A ROADMAP TO IMPLEMENT THE AUDIT. AND THAT WILL HAVE MATRIX THAT WILL HAVE -- TIME FRAMES BENCHMARKS -- AND THAT WILL BE DUE AND THE ACTING DIRECTOR WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S DONE IN A TIMELY WAY. IT WOULDN'T AND THAT PLAN THOUGH IS IS PHASED OVERLAID WITH A LONG TERM VISION RIGHT I MEAN IT'S LIKE I'M SURE I'M I'M SURE MISTER FRAZIER GOOD. APPRECIATE THIS EXAMPLE WHERE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NOTHING FRUSTRATES MIKE INCISIONS MORE WHEN THEY WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING TO BUILD A ROAD AND AND SO. THEY THEY BUILD A SIDEWALK. AND THEY SPENT HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND DOLLARS A BILL THE SIDEWALK AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY FIX THE ROADS THE TERROR OF THE ROAD EDITOR OF THE SIDEWALK IT IS BUILT IN AND THEN REBUILD THE WHOLE THING ALL OVER AGAIN. SO ARE WE YOU KNOW WE GONNA. PUT OTHERS -- INVESTMENT INTO THESE INTO THESE ALL THESE STRUCTURE AND AND IN THESE BROKEN MORTAR STUFF AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IN FIVE YEARS YOUR VISION IS NOT TO HAVE BROKEN WATER ANYMORE. IT'S HAT IS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE OUT OF THESE BUILDINGS AND WE'RE GOING TO AND THEN AND WE'RE TO CREATE THESE BRAND NEW COOL CHAOS AT THAT APPLE STORE RELATED AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IN THE BUILDINGS THAT WE USE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN. IT'S NOT YET YOU IS A MAKES AS WE'RE NOT IT'S NOT LAYERED AND AND WE ARE IN INDIA THERE'S SYNERGY. WE'RE THEY THESE ARE EXAMPLES CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT GOING. TO TO REINVENT EVERY DMV OFFICE IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO AND AND AND TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN WE HAVE A THOMAS VEHICLES AND WE HAVE FEWER. PEOPLE DRIVING -- AND AND MAYBE WE ARE REALLY TURNING THE DMV IN TWENTY YEARS INTO AN IDEA AUTHENTICATION -- SHOP AND NOT NOT SOMETHING THAT DEALS WITH THE VEHICLES I MEAN THAT THOSE ARE THINGS WORK. WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH HERE AND AND CERTAINLY NOT CONTEMPLATING IN TERMS OF THE IMMEDIATE PLANS BUT WE WOULD NEVER WANT. TO YOUR EXAMPLE OF TEARING UP THE SPENDING MONEY AND TEARING SOMETHING UP ONLY -- TO WASTE THE TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS OBVIOUSLY NINE APPRECIATE THAT AND I I THINK THAT MY VERGE OF QUESTIONING AYE I THINK IT'S A MEMBER SMITH IS IS CORRECT MAYBE. THERE IS NEW WHAT THE NEWTON LOCALIZED -- APPROACHES AND THEN AND THEN T&lt;c.cyan&gt; GET INTO WHAT&lt;/c&gt; OTHER STATES ARE DOING -- I THINK IT IT MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT WE LOOK AT OTHER STATES ARE DOING IT VERY WELL LEARN FROM THE STATE'S SAID A FAILED. BOB WE WOULD I WOULD I WOULD PROBABLY SAY THAT OUR STATE HAS STRUGGLED CLEARLY OVER THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE DAY -- IN TERMS OF A AMPLE NAY WILL ID AND SELL LET'S NOT RECREATE THE WHEEL BUT I THINK I SHARE AS AS YOU SAID EARLIER I I SHARE SOME NUMBER ESTIMATES FRUSTRATION -- IN THIS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. THANK YOU. GREAT QUICKNESS FRAZIER. SO I APPRECIATE US SECRETARY AND IN THE INTERIM. RECTOR COMING IN TALKING TO ME YESTERDAY ABOUT THE VISION OF GOING FORWARD. AND AGAIN I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IT IS. TROUBLING TO ME IS. FOR LOCAL SEVEN YEARS THAT I'VE. NOWBEEN HERE -- IN FOUR YEARS IS THE CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION -- I'VE HAD THIS EXPECTATION THAT WE'D HAVE RESULTS. AND I'VE BEEN TOLD OVER OVER OVER WE THROWING MONEY AT IT -- PROMISES MADE WERE NEVER PROMISES KEPT [inaudible] AND SO [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] APPREHENSIVE ABOUT. THIS AGENCY BECAUSE OF THE REPUTATION IN THE PAST. NOW I DO. HAVE SOME RENEWED -- EXCITEMENT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE SHARED WITH ME YESTERDAY AND WHAT YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY SHARED WITH THIS COMMITTEE TODAY -- I'D APPRECIATE THE THE GOVERNOR PUTTING. YOU IN THIS PLACE -- LONG OVERDUE -- BUT UNITE. WE TALKED ABOUT CULTURE YESTERDAY ALSO. BROWN ALL CULTURE -- AND THE EXPECTATION OF THE PUBLIC. AND I THINK MISTER PATTERSON WAS KIND OF SPOT ON WE TALKED ABOUT THE THE ABILITY TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. WHEN I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A TNT? THEY TELL ME BETWEEN EIGHT AND TWELVE AND THEY USUALLY SHOW UP AT TWELVE OKAY SO. MAKING. A GOOD FAITH EFFORT I THINK IS IS AN HONORABLE THING. REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED -- BUT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT CROSS TRAINING OF STAFF I DON'T WANT AN EMPTY WHEN. IF SOMEBODY CALLS IN SICK I WANT SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO MAN THAT. OR WOMAN THAT THAT WINDOW SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO PROVIDE EVERY TRANSACTION YOU TALKED ABOUT MOBILE POP UPS -- RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE CAPACITY FOR TRANSACTIONS PEOPLE WAITING LINE WE CLOSED IF YOU ARE I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER BUT WE CLOSE SOME DMV'S. A IN THE PAST. I DON'T THINK IT WAS A LOT BUT THERE WERE THERE WERE. WINDOWS THAT. WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPACITY. I WANT TO SEE A BIGGER MOVE TOWARDS. ACCOMMODATING IN SOME KIND OF MODULAR FASHION -- THE RURAL AREAS -- WHERE YOU HAVE TARGETED -- HABITUAL. EAST AND YOU KNOW PROBLEMS OF GETTING PEOPLE SERVICE -- BUT I THINK ACCOUNTABILITY TO ME IS IS THE BIGGEST FACTOR IS I DON'T THINK WE'RE GETTING ENOUGH REAL TIME INFORMATION BACK -- ON A REGULAR BASIS NOW THE MONTH EVERY MONTH NOW HAS BEEN. YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A REFRESHING THING AND I READ THAT REPORT -- AND AGAIN I'M TRYING TO HOLD BACK BILLS AS YOU ASKED -- BECAUSE OF THE ONEROUS OF FASHION IT WOULD TAKE TO THE AGENCY RIGHT NOW -- SO THAT YOU'RE NOT IMPOUNDED WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER EXPECTATIONS. THAT BEING SAID I MEAN. YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU YOU'RE ASKING FOR A LOT OF MONEY TO BE ABLE TO FIX THIS. AND WE TALKED ABOUT MY RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY IS THE DMV IS THAT AS THE POLICY CHAIR BUT I OVERSEE. THE HOT HIGHWAY PATROL -- T. S. AND CALTRANS IN MY FASHION. AND I ASKED FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. FROM THE HIGHWAY PATROL BECAUSE WE'RE VERY SHORT IN OFFICERS. WERE THOUSAND OFFICERS DOWN. WHEN I WAS DENIED IT WAS VETOED? AND WORD UP 27% AND DEATHS. SO AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE'VE GOT TO MAKE. A DECISION ABOUT PRIORITIES. I APPRECIATE THAT WE CAN GET AN ECONOMY OF SCALE WITH A LOT OF EFFICIENCIES ARE PUT IN PLACE. BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT ADDITIONAL MONEY BECAUSE PROMISE AS HAVE NOT BEEN KEPT UP TO DATE. MY EXPECTATION IS TO SAVE LIVES. AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND IF I CAN DO THAT I SAID OFFICER KILLED IN RIVERSIDE. HEY I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOW IT FROZE OFFICERS ON THE ROAD. IT'S HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO DO THAT SO. I THINK WE HAVE AN EXPECTATION. OF OF BALANCE. BUT YOU KNOW. AGAIN. SHOW ME THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT AND KEEP IT IN BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A REVOLVING DOOR. BUT YOU CAN KEEP IT ROLLING. AND THEN I'M MORE APT TO BE. LOOKING AT OTHER RESOURCES FOR REVENUE FOR YOU. OUTSIDE OF THE NBA OR IN YOUR A PAST CITY LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY YOUR CAPACITY TO RAISE REVENUE AND OTHER AREAS. BUT I HAVE SO MANY OTHER NEEDS. IN THE MBA. THAT I JUST I CAN'T SEE THIS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT FOR ME. AND AND I APPRECIATE. THE WILLINGNESS TO BRING THIS BACK IN THIS DISCUSSION. YOU'VE OF ALL. YOU OF THE VAULT AND YOU'VE TAKEN THIS AGENCY TO ANOTHER PLACE IT. I THINK IT CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT I'M ALWAYS AFRAID OF THAT AGGRESSION -- DIGRESS IS. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER. PETRIE-NORRIS IS IT ONE QUICK QUESTION I'M I THINK. THAT MR FONG BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON IT BUT THERE WAS AN ARTICLE TODAY IN THE LA TIMES ONLINE THE MOTOR VOTER. ROLLOUT. I HAVEN'T WHEN DID YOU SEE IT IF YOU HAD ANY REACTIONS TO THAT ARTICLE IF YOU'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON AND SOME OF THOSE FINDINGS WELL. FIRST I WILL ASSURE YOU THAT A DV WE TAKE THE MOTOR VOTER RESPONSIBLE IN GETTING IT RIGHT VERY SERIOUSLY WE ARE COMMITTED TO IT. I WILL ALSO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE -- BEEN IN CONSTANT CONVERSATION THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS WE MEET ON A WEEKLY BASIS. WITH A SEPARATE STATE TO LOOK AT HIM PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING RECORDS OVER TO THEM THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY HANDLE. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPY -- HELPFUL IS -- ERNST AND YOUNG AUDIT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD RECEIVING THAT AUDIT THERE ARE STILL IN OUR OFFICE RIGHT NOW DOING SOME ASSESSMENTS. BUT I THINK ALL OF THAT COMING TOGETHER. WILL BE VERY HELPFUL MAKE SOME DECISIONS GOING FORWARD I I ANTICIPATE SOME OF THE FINDINGS MAY NOT BE DIFFERENT THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AUDIT EITHER. I DO FIRMLY BELIEVE GOVERNANCE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE I KNOW WE'VE REPEATED THAT ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT ANY HEALTHY ORGANIZATION AND ANY PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATION NON PROFIT OR EVEN IN THE STATE. IT USUALLY STARTS WITH A REALLY COOL IT'S STRONG ENTERPRISE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AT THE TOP. AND IT'S IT DEALS WITH THE BREAKING DOWN OF SILENCE DMV IS A RICH IN SILOS. AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS BREAK DOWN THOSE SILOS SO THERE THAT ACTIVITY IN EFFORTS THAT ARE. BEING ADDRESSED -- AND THAT'S A CULTURAL CHANGE -- BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRESHER AND ADDRESS THE CULTURE PEAS AND AND THE MORALE AND AND AND FOLKS ARE FULLY LITTLE BEATEN DOWN AND TRYING TO DO BUT THE BEST THEY CAN WITH THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE -- AND AND WHAT I NEED TO DO AND AND MY KIND OF MY MESSAGE TO PEOPLE IS I WANT TO MOVE. FROM MAINTAINING OUR GRANDPARENTS DMV TO CREATING OUR CHILDREN STAMPING AND I BECAUSE THEY ALL KNOW THEIR CHILDREN WOULD NOT LIKE GOING INTO THE DMV THAT EXISTS TODAY. BUT WE ALL COLLECTIVELY COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO BE ON THAT ROAD TOGETHER AND I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF KIND OF A VISIONING SESSION THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE JUST US BY OURSELVES. BUT WHAT DOES THE FUTURE DMV LOOK LIKE IN INDIANA CERTAINLY IS A MODEL FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT ON THE MOTOR VOTER AND GETTING BACK TO THAT PIECE -- I WOULD TELL YOU THERE'S BEEN GREAT PROGRESS -- SINCE THE THE RESEARCH ASSOCIATE WITH THAT ARTICLE -- WE DO HAVE A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IN PLACE -- ONE THINGS I AM PUTTING TOGETHER IS A MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM IT'S NOT A PROJECT THE TV IT'S A PROGRAM. AND WE NEED A STAFF AND AS A PROGRAMMER APPROPRIATELY IT TOUCHES MANY OF OUR PROGRAM AREAS AND SO I'M WORKING THROUGH ESTABLISHING REALLY THAT PERMANENT PROGRAM UNDERSTAND THE F. T. EASE THE AND THE P. WISE THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO GO HEAD SUPPORT THAT PROGRAMMING ON A GO FORWARD. BASIS IT HAS BEEN A RESOURCE DEMAND. BUT I ALSO SAY THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN AS EFFICIENT AS WE COULD BE AND HOW HE MANAGE IT SO WE'RE ALSO. DOING A LOT OF PROCESS IMPROVEMENT AND NUMBER THE AREAS AROUND A MOTOR VOTER. SO DO YOU THINK ANY FURTHER INQUIRY. WOULD BE WARRANTED KIND OF BASED ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT ARTICLE POINTED TO OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. I THINK THE ERNST AND YOUNG -- ASSESSMENT WILL BE REVEALING TO WHAT THEY FOUND AND THEN I THINK THIS BODY CERTAINLY HAS ABILITY TO MAKE A DETERMINATION GOING FORWARD OKAY SO PRINCETON YOUNG. DVD BUT IT [inaudible] THIS PAST. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS BENEFIT DRESSED -- HAS ANYBODY ASKED. WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY DMB? IF YOU COULD DO THE ETCH A SKETCH TURN THE MISTAKES UPSIDE DOWN. AND DESIGN THE DMV OF THE FUTURE. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. WELL AND AS YOU AND I THINK DISCUSSED YESTERDAY WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER ABOUT -- SOME OF THE IDEAS AROUND -- THE IDEA AND AND SKIS WITH THE DMV OF THE FUTURE ONE BEING A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SELF SERVICE DMV. BUT NO LINES AND PEOPLE MOVING FREELY WITH THROUGH AN OFFICE IN A STREAMLINED MANNER -- WITH WITH. UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE -- THEIR SERVICE WHERE THEY CAN GO TO GET THE SERVICE THEY NEED IN A VERY. EASY AND THOUGHTFUL WAY LIKE AN APPLE STORE -- FOR INSTANCE A PLEASANT ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENT THAT IT'S CLEAN EFFICIENT -- ONE THAT SERVES EVERYONE THAT IS THERE TO BE SERVED IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY AGAIN YOU MENTIONED AMAZON TYPE OF SERVICES AND WE TALKED ABOUT AN APPLE STORE. WE'VE TALKEDTO I'VE TALKED TO THE ARCHITECTS ACTUALLY THEY HAVE DESIGNED THE ORIGINAL DESIGNERS OF THE APPLE STORE. I'M HOPING THAT THEY CAN BE ENGAGED IS AS AS ONE THAT PERHAPS ANSWERS THEY ARE IF Q.. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT WE HAVE HAD I WISH WE COULD HAVE AN ACTION AT TO SKETCH AND START OVER BUT I THINK YOU NOTED -- SIR EARLIER WELL THAT AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE DMV IN ITS CURRENT STATE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO EVERY DAY WHILE WE ARE LOOKING. AND MAKING -- IN REAL TIME CHANGES NOW BUT STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING MORE CHANGES WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH A VERY AGED AN UNSTABLE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR I. T. WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND UNDER RESOURCE AND AND RESOURCE TECHNICIANS IN THE CALL CENTERS AND INDEED EVEN AT THE WINDOWS. AND SO. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH AND DEAL WITH NOW WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING THAT DMV OF THE FUTURE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AFTER NOT BUT IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING -- WITH RESPECT TO THIS BUILDING. RIGHT WE HAVE TO OPERATE IN IT AND SO WE'RE BUILDING SOMETHING OVER THERE. WE'RE GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA GO OVER THERE. YEAH AND THEN. THIS GETS FIXED I MEAN THE BIG CHALLENGER TO ME IN THE AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT. IS YOU GOTTA KEEP THE THING GOING FOR THIS EVEN IF IT IS HERKY JERKY AND JUST. AND THEN. BRING IT DOWN. AND THEN TURN AROUND AND BRING UP THE NEW. ONE WE WERE DOING THAT WITH THIS BUILDING  CAN YOU DO IT WITH THE DMV. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S I LOVE THE ASPIRATIONAL APPROACH THAT YOU'VE TAKEN ON AND I THINK I MENTIONED THAT TO A COUPLE TIMES I APPRECIATE I DO. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SO JUST THE ARMY GET BACK -- TO ISSUES -- BUDGET REQUEST SO JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN AS WELL OF MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN YEAH. FORTY POINT FOUR MILLION REQUEST -- SIX MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST THOSE REQUESTS WERE NOT APPROVED. BY JAIL BC A BECAUSE WE WERE WAITING FOR THIS HEARING. HAS THAT MONEY BEEN SPENT. AND THE INITIAL FORTY POINT FOUR MILLION THAT WHEN THAT REQUEST WENT OVER AND IN REGARDS TO WORKING WITH -- THE WAIT TIMES AND EVERYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES WHEN THAT REQUEST WENT OVER IN IN JANUARY WE HAD NOTATED THAT THERE WAS AT THAT POINT TIME SEVENTEEN MILLION. THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT TO DATE AND THAT THE PROJECTION WAS FROM JANUARY THROUGH -- JUNE THAT ANOTHER -- TWENTY TWO MILLION WAS GOING TO BE SPENT AND SO WE'RE NOW AT A POINT SINCE WE'RE IN APRIL YEAH THAT THE MONEY IS CONTINUING TO GET SPENT. OKAY SO YOU'RE YOU'RE. THE MONEY HAS BEEN APPROVED THE SPENDING AND DEFICIT. UNFORTUNATELY YES. SO SO THE THE THE REASON THE MONEY WAS NOT APPROVED BECAUSE WE'RE WAITING. FOR THIS HEARING IN HOPES THAT WE WOULD HEAR -- ONE THE WORK THAT HAD BEEN DONE. AS WELL AS THE PLAN. FOR THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHAT WE GOT IN THIS HEARING WAS. THE WAR THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE WHICH DIDN'T GET DONE. WE DID GET A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. I ALWAYS HAVE IS JUST NUMBERS AND BODIES -- WHERE THESE -- WORK WERE YOU KNOW NUMBERS AND BODIES AND THAT'S IT. SO AT THIS POINT I STILL CAN'T. AUTHORIZE AT LEAST FOR FOR OUR HOUSE TO APPROVE [inaudible] THIS MONEY. SUCH AS THE TECH INTO THE ON THE JOB IS THE REQUEST AND I'LL -- DEFERRED FINANCE AS WELL IS OBVIOUSLY THE THE POINT THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WAS TO ASSIST WITH WAIT TIMES. AND SO WITH THE JAIL BC THAT WAS TO BRING THE WAIT TIMES -- BACK DOWN TO TO AT LEAST WITHIN OUR GOALS. RIGHT BUT WE WE JUST DISCUSSED. THE WAIT TIME INFORMATION YOU HAVE. WADE IS NOT ACCURATE. I SAID ALRIGHT EARLIER YOU PRO IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM WHEN I SAID THIS BUT AGAIN I HAVE PEOPLE THEY GET IN LINE AT FIVE AM. AT SIX AM. THERE ARE THREE HOUR OR FOUR HOUR WAIT TIME. IS NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. CORRECT IN AND I'M FOURTEEN THERE'S REALLY GONNA BE NO WAY FOR US TO TO TRACK THAT UNTIL SOMEONE IN THE OFFICE RIGHT. YOU YOU YOU HAVE THE DIRECTOR START OFF BY SAYING WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE PEOPLE PREFER TO COME IN FIRST IN THE MORNING RATHER THAN. LATER. SO. IN ESSENCE MORE PEOPLE COULD BE COMING IN EARLIER INSTEAD OF LATER. THEY COULD JUST BE DECIDING HEY WE'RE JUST PANEL WAS GONNA GET THE FIVE AM AGO WAIT INDIA BECAUSE JUST JUST TO GET IT OVER WITH -- BUT WE HAVE NO SO WE A WE DON'T KNOW THE LEVEL OF THE ACCURACY OF YOUR DATA. YOUR DATA IS NOT RIPE. SO THE THE WAIT TIME DATA THAT'S IN THE MONTH REPORTS THAT WE SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATURE. IS DOES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE QUEUE WAIT TIME WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ALL AWARE OF IN REGARDS TO WIN THE Q. TICKET IS GIVEN. AND THEN THEY ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE THE PRICKLY WAIT TIME AND SO THAT'S INCORPORATED ABOUT BUT IT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IF SOMEONE IS WAITING AT THE OFFICE BEFORE THE OFFICE EVEN OPENS AND THERE'S NOBODY THERE -- DOES WAIT TIMES ARE NOT TRACKED. SO AGAIN -- YOU YOU HAVE DATA THAT'S NOT ACCURATE. SO WE ARE. THAT THE BUDGET WAS CONDITIONAL UPON. APPROVAL WE WE CAN'T APPROVE IT. AT THIS POINT AGAIN -- WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION WE WAITED FOR THE STRIKE TEAM WE WAITED FOR THE AUTO SO I THINK WHAT WE DO HAVE IS. WE HAVE A CLEAR EVALUATION OF WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS? WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT? SO IF I MAY SO ON A NUMBER OF ITEMS IN THE IN THE FINANCE LETTER. INTO THE FINANCE LETTERS BROKEN UP INTO SECTIONS AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER RIGHT TO THE TOP SECTION AT THE SOCHI WITH REAL ID. THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD OTHER LIKE THAT THE WE JUST CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT THAT BEFORE TRANSACTIONS MINUTES. THE WISE. BUT THEN ALSO IN THE IN THE REQUEST IS A LOT OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED PER THE SAY AUDIT OR PER THE STRIKE TEAM AND IN THE NARRATIVE OF THE FUNDING REQUEST ACTUALLY BREAKS OUT ITS RELATED WHICH I'D RIVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE APRIL FINANCE. NUMBER LETTER YEAH YEAH YEAH I'M TALKING ABOUT THE JANUARY IN THE MARCH FINANCE MATTERS. THE DEAL WITH THE NOTICES. THE THE WHOLE POINT OF THE JAIL BC NOTICES WHERE -- PRIMARILY TO MAINTAIN THE WAIT TIMES AT IT EXCEPT WHEN I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE I'M JUST SAYING THAT. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. THOSE LETTERS WERE NOT APPROVED. THAT APPROPRIATION. WAS NOT APPROVED. BECAUSE THERE WAS A LACK OF FAITH. IN THE DEPARTMENT TO EXECUTE. WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO? NOW WE HAVE AN AUDIT AUDIT THAT PROVES NOT ONLY. DID THEY NOT EXECUTED THEY HAVE A PROBLEM -- THEY THEY THEY SAID THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED IT DIDN'T DO. THE THOUGHT IS VERY CLEAR ON WE CAN GO BACK AND WE CAN LOOK AT THE AUGUST TESTIMONY YOU WERE THERE YOU'RE DOING A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE. SO WE CAN GO BACK AND WE PLAYED OUT BUT IT'S CLEAR WHAT WAS SAID WAS NOT. TO SO AGAIN YOU'RE YOU'RE RUNNING A DEFICIT NOW BECAUSE JANUARY AND MARCH THE FORTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION NOT PROVE SO YOU'RE SPENDING THE MONEY IS NOT APPROVED ON A WE CAN GET FROM -- AND THEN YOU GOT APRIL FINANCE MATTER AT THIS POINT I'M SAYING HOUSE OF THIS. THIS MOMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION. WE HAVE TODAY I CAN'T RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL. I CAN'T I MEAN. THE AGAIN. THERE'S NO PLAN. THERE WAS NO WHERE THIS MONEY IS GOING TO GO WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE USED FOR ALL I HAVE IS A NUMBER OF BODIES. THERE WAS NO HOW IS THIS GOING TO IMPACT THE WORK OF THE FUTURE. IF IF YOU HAVE PLANS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE THERE'S KIOSKS OR WHETHER IT IS A STAFF IN THE FIELD OFFICES OR THE I. T. GREAT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT. WHERE I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER SAID HEY? DON'T GIVE US INFORMATION DON'T GIVE US YOUR PLANTS. IN FACT THAT'S BEEN THE ON GOING REQUEST FROM THE COMMITTEE WHICH WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE INFORMATION. THE OTHER POINT JUST TO GO BACK I MEAN JUST TO TAKE A FIVE POINT ON CHAOS. AGAIN AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH BASED ON YOUR ROUGH NUMBERS YOU KNOW. EVERY KIOSKS WAS SEEING ABOUT -- THIRTEEN THIRTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY TRANSACTIONS AND THEN AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN YOU'RE SEEING ONLY ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS. SO AS YOU'RE DEPLOYING MORE KIOSK TO GETTING LESS USAGE PER CHAOS IS NOT SO IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR. YOUR THE DATA DOESN'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT -- HEY WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE CHAOS. NO I DID MY TIME THAT IS CORRECT AS IT RELATES TO AS YOU ROLL OUT A NEW KIOSK IT'S REALLY THE ADOPTION RATE IN FOR THE NEW CHAOS WHEN THEY FIRST GO OUT. THEY DON'T HAVE A HUGE UPTAKE IT'S A MATTER MAKING SURE THE COMMUNITY IS AWARE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG BIG POINTS AS IT RELATES TO I KNOW THAT. STRIKE COMMITMENT IN WORKING WITH MARKETING THE DATE ON THAT. AGAIN LIKE I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS BE PERSUADED BY INFORMATION. BY FAX. WE CAN GET YOUR OTHER LIVE THROUGH IT SO SOUTHERN. THERE IS A SINGLE OPTIC RATE THAT'S WHY WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE SLAUGHTER CREEK HOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR TO PICK UP YEAH WE CAN GET YOU THAT THAT'S NO PROBLEM. HELLO THE TICKET TAKER I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION DIRECTLY WITH ME. THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS I WOULD SAY PROBABLY DEPENDS ON THE LOCATION FOR INSTANCE AS YOU MAY KNOW ROUGH WE HAVE ONE IN THE LIBRARY. APPROACHING THERE'S I WOULD PROBABLY SAY IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR. AND FOR THE MOST OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE GONNA USE IT THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION ARE GONNA USE IT ONCE A YEAR. BUT IT IS SIR ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I ASKED THE VENDOR. TO REVIEW THEIR METHODOLOGIES AND AND ALSO PUT TOGETHER A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNICATIONS PLAN BECAUSE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THEY ARE INDEED -- ADVERTISE MARKETED AND ARE IN VISIBLE PLACES AND IN HIGH TRAFFIC PLACES AND IN USEFUL PLACES THEY HAVE -- CONTRACTS WITH MANY OTHER STATES AND THEY PROVIDE THE SAME SERVICE AND MANY OTHER STATES HAD AND AND INDEED EVEN GREATER GREATER TRANSACTION SERVICES. WHAT WE WHICH IS GREAT I THINK WE FORGET STRESS? I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO YOUR PLACE COMMENTS AND PLEASE ON THE FRONT OF DALE B. C. NOTIFICATION -- AS NOTED IT IF IF PRESS WILL BE MISTER TO HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED A LETTER BACK FROM JAIL BC SAYING IT'S NOT APPROVED RIGHT THIS IS THIS WAS A POTS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS HEARING. IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE THAT AS NOTED IN OUR JANUARY THIRD LETTER. YOU ASKED WHETHER GOING TO GET THE MONEY THERE. ARE LETTER INDICATED THAT WITHOUT THIS AUGMENTATION DMB IS GONNA HAVE TO ELIMINATE STAFFING -- TO THE OVERTIME SOME OF THE SATURDAY SERVICES -- AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO REDUCE OUR BASE BUDGET AND SO THAT IS ALL THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT IF IF THIS FUNDING IS NOT APPROVED AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE PHONE CALLS WE WILL ALL BE GETTING I'M. IF THAT HAPPENS WITH REGARDS TO YOU SAID YOU'D BE PERSUADED BY DATA WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE DATA AND THAT WE CAN -- WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING THE MONTHLY WAIT WAIT TIME REPORTS AND AS YOU KNOW WE CAN TRACK FROM THE TICKET BUT NOT NECESSARILY. PRIOR TO THAT AND WE WE WOULD WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY. QUESTIONS AS TO HOW WE CAN IMPROVE WE'RE APART WE'RE WE'RE GETTING IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING PHONE CALLS RAPID WRECKED OUR PHONE CALLS TO BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING PLAN SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA GET ANYMORE PHONE CALLS. FOR OUR AND IN FACT IF YOU HAVEN'T VISITED A DMB REALLY REALLY I I THINK IT'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD ALL DO A SIX IN THE MORNING. BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I DO. SO ARE. IF IF THAT IS A THREAT THAT'S FINE I AM. YOU KNOW AGAIN. THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT I THINK I THINK. THEM JUST FINISH SO I THINK. I SAY THIS TO REITERATE THE LACK OF SERIOUSNESS THE DEPARTMENT TOOK. UPON THIS YEAR. IT WAS CLEAR WE WERE WAITING FOR THIS HEARING TO APPROVE. THIS YEAR'S MONEY AND TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE WE WOULD BE FOR THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE DEPARTMENT DID NOT COME FORWARD. WITH A PLAN. THEY DID NOT COME FORWARD WITH ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF A BUDGET RIGHT. BY A SPECIFIC DEPLOYMENT PLAN HOW THEY WERE GOING TO ADDRESS. THE DEFICIENCIES THAT WE KNOW EXISTED THE AGAIN THE AUDITOR'S CODIFIED WHAT WE KNEW WAS ALREADY GOING ON SO I I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUDITORS -- WERE ABLE TO CODIFY IN A SINGULAR DOCUMENT THE PROBLEMS. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WERE SURPRISED. ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN IN A DMV IS NOT SURPRISED BY ANY OF THIS INFORMATION. SO KNOWING THAT THIS INFORMATION EXISTS NOW YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT SO YOU COULD YOU HAVE ROAD MAP. BUT AGAIN. CLEARLY THE DEPARTMENT THE AGENCY DID NOT PREPARE. FOR THIS HERE THIS HAS BEEN ON THE RECORD THEY THAT YOU KNEW THIS IS COMING UP FOR MONTHS SO AGAIN. WE NEED A PLAN. WE NEED A CLEAR DELINEATION WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE SPENT ON ARE YOU CAN GIVE IT DOWN TO THE FIELD OFFICE I DON'T CARE IF YOU GIVE IT DOWN TO THE COMPUTER. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME. DURING DURING WHICH I'VE BEEN CHAIRMAN BY SAYING -- YOU'VE GIVEN ME TOO MUCH INFORMATION THIS IS WAY TOO MUCH DATA. GIVE IT TO ME A FAIR DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO REVIEW IT I HAVE NOTHING BUT FREE TIME. I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO IT RIGHT I I SPEND MY WEEKEND READING THIS AUDIT COVER TO COVER I FOUND A GREAT. SITE JUST AGAIN JUST TO COMMEND AUDITING. BUT THE FACT THAT. THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT SHOW THE COMMITTEE THE RESPECT TOGETHER. A WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN. IT WILL FOR PROPOSAL KNOWING THAT THE TWO LETTERS HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED. AND WE'RE BEING HELD FOR THIS HEARING. IS VERY TROUBLING HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC. AND THE FACT THAT THE MONEY THAT WAS APPROVED. WAS SPENT AND WHAT'S NOT SPENT APPROPRIATELY AGAIN PER THE AUDIT STAFF. MONEY WAS SPENT PEOPLE WERE TRYING. AGAIN TABLETS. TABLETS WERE BOUGHT NOT USE. THE TEXT MESSAGING. PROBABLY GONNA GET. THIS IS JUST THESE ARE JUST THE HIGHLIGHTS WE COULD GO ON I COULD BE HERE TILL MISTER FRAZIER DINNER IS OVER AND WE COULD KEEP WE CAN JUST GO DOWN THE LIST. BUT AGAIN I THINK YOU GET THE PICTURE BUT AGAIN. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT BRING FORWARD. HI. AND LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO INFORM OUR DEAL BC CHAIR. THAT WE ARE REJECTING. THE LETTER. CAN WE WILL END AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW THE ASSEMBLY CANNOT INCLUDE THIS APPROPRIATION REQUEST OR THE FORTY SIX MILLION THAT YOU ASK FOR FOR THIS YEAR. IN THE OUR VERSION OF THE BUDGET. TYLER HOW HOW ANY CLEAR I COULD BE. SO WHEN CAN WE GET THE INFORMATION WE WOULD LIKE. WE CAN WORK WITH AMERICA THERE IS -- THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED A LITTLE MORE DETAIL THAN WHAT'S IN THE FINANCE LETTER AS AT LEAST ON PAGE TWENTY THREE THAT BREAKS OUT ALL THE MONEY -- HELLO HELLO WHERE WHERE THESE PEOPLE GO ON FIELD OFFICES I WANT TO KNOW -- WHAT HOW HOW THIS IS GONNA -- HOW THIS IS GONNA ACCOMPLISH EACH OF THE GOALS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? YEAH I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS. LIKE LIKE I LOVE THE SPREAD SHE DON'T GET ME WRONG THAT THE SPREADSHEETS GREAT. RIGHT WITHOUT A PLAN. AND UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. YOU DON'T HAVE. THE ENTIRE STATE INTO UPROAR ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S PERFORMANCE WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION JUST BASED ON THE SPREADSHEET. THESE ARE NOT NORMAL SYMBOL AND FORTY THESE ARE NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY'VE BEEN GOING ON FOR TOO LONG. SO THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. THIS IS THIS IS NOT ANY DIFFERENT. I MEAN WE'RE HAVING THE SAME THIS IS LIKE GROUNDHOG DAY WE'RE HAVING THE SAME HERE WE HAD IN AUGUST. IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING. I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM. BECAUSE WE DISCUSS THIS IN AUGUST. AND WE SAID HEY WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA GREEN LIGHT THIS LETTER AND WE TOOK GRIEF IN THE PRESS. FOR GREEN LIGHTING THIS LATTER END SO NOT ONLY DID YOU NOT REWARD OUR FAITH. YOU DEMONSTRATED THAT WE SHOULDN'T TRUST THE DEPARTMENT. TO DO WHAT IT SAYS. SO WHAT MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE. SO YOU SEE YOU BETTER COME WITH AN INCREDIBLE DETAIL WHERE THIS IS GOING HOW'S IT GOING TO BE SPENT WHO'S GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE. AND THEN I WANT TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR BECAUSE THE DIRECTORS G AT BEAT BEAT YOUR YOUR THE YOUR THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF THE MONEY. SO -- SO LET ME ASK YOU HOW COME TABLETS WERE BOUGHT THE NOT USED. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS HERE AUGUST. YEAH AND I WOULD SAY THAT THAT TABLETS WERE WERE UTILIZED TABLETS WERE DEPLOYED OUT TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THE OFFICES THEN WENT ALL OUT TO ALL HUNDREDS OF ME WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED. I THINK OF THAT RELATE TO IT THE CONSISTENCY CHALLENGE AND SOME OF THE TABLETS MAY HAVE BEEN USED IN THE ARMY KNOWLEDGE TEST AREA AND NOT AT THE FRONT FRONT AREA ANSWER LIKE THAT THE PEOPLE TAKE THE ARMY KNOWLEDGE TEST. WILL CHECK THEM AND GET THEM APPOINTMENTS THERE SO SHE WAS A DIFFERENT YOU HAVE NO WAY. OF KNOWING WHICH TABLETS GUY USE WENT. TELLING YOU DO. NOT. WE DO HAVE A WAY AND SO WE HAVE A MECHANISM OR WE CAN TRACK THE LAST TIME THAT THE TABLET WAS. LONG GONE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR IT INFRASTRUCTURE TO FIND OUT NOT USUALLY WHAT WAS LYING ON THE TIME THE OFFICE FOR AND THEN. MEET UP WITH A FEW YEARS HAVE YOU DEPLOY. THERE ARE HOW MANY IN TOTAL -- FIVE HUNDRED YEAH I THOUGHT WHAT'S PROPER PUT PERCENT OF BEING USED. LAST THE LAST TIME I GOT A REPORT IT WAS A HUNDRED AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT TABLETS OVER. ABOUT SEVENTY OFFICES I I THINK OF ONE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE AND A TABLET MAY JUST BE AN OFFICE MAYBE YOU SEE ONE TABLET WAITING FOR THE OTHER TO CHARGE SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IN A SMALLER OFFICE. AND A LARGER OFFICE YOU. I DON'T KNOW TOTALLY I CHARGE MY TABLET OVERNIGHT. SO -- AGAIN -- SO ALL THE FIVE HUNDRED YOU AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO TABLETS OF BEING USUALLY. YEAH SO SO WHAT'S WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE THE OTHER. THREE HUNDRED TOM WAS DOING BEING CHARGED. THAT'S OUR TRAINER IMMEDIATE RIGHT NOW TWENTY IS THE ROOT CAUSE WHY ARE THEY NOT BEING USED AS A TRAINING. IN WHERE WE'RE ON THAT PATH AND I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT TEXT MESSAGES AS WELL. SO YES WE SHARE YOUR CONCERN THERE ON TEXT MESSAGES ARMY UNDER UTILIZED. YOU KNOW AND WE ARE WORKING TO KEEP MATIC ASPECT OF SPEAKING YES SECRETARY ABOUT HER SAID OUR VENDOR WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIND OUT HOW MANY TEXT MESSAGES ARE SENT HAPPENING DAY OR TO SPECIFIC PART OF TIME. BUT WE CAN'T TIE IT BACK TO THE OFFICE AND THAT IS THE PATH THAT WERE GOING DOWN THE CAN MANAGE. TO TIE IT BACK TO THE OFFICE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. WHO'S DOING IT WHEN THE THINGS THAT I'M USING GIVE SEVEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS TODAY. HOW MANY I'M SORRY YES SEVEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS TODAY RIGHT WE WENT WE WENT BACK KNOW HOW MANY CUSTOMERS THE OTHER DAY? HOUSE A WEEK I'M SORRY ALL. CUSTOMER TODAY ANYWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY AND EIGHTY TO EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND RIGHT PERFECT SERVICE SEVENTY EIGHTY FIVE YEAH RIGHT. I APOLOGIZE HOW ME TEXT MESSAGES HELLO. LAST THE DAY I J. YESTERDAY WHEN I LOOKED WE HAD. BUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR SENT OUT. BUT I DO WANT TO BUT HAVE YET NOT YOU HAVE TO HIT A THRESHOLD IN ORDER FOR THE TEXT MESSAGE TO BE SENT OUT. SO EVEN THOUGH I MAY FIND OUT FROM ONE OF MY WAIT TIME DOESN'T TAKES THE THE TIME THE MESSAGE WOULD BE SENT OUT SO I THINK IT'S FAIR THAT WE WE HAVE A BUFFER IN THAT FORMULA AS WELL. AND AND THAT'S AND THAT'S FINE BUT AGAIN BUT LIKE I THINK MY CONCERN IS. THESE QUESTIONS ARE GETTING. ANSWERED AND BUDGET COMMITTEE WITH NOT NOT AS MUCH DETAIL AS ONE I WOULD LIKE BUT WHAT IT DEMONSTRATES IS THAT THERE'S NOT AS MUCH ATTENTION. AS WE WOULD LIKE ON THESE FRIES VICIOUS BECAUSE WHEN YOU AS A DEPARTMENT CAME FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. LAST TIME HE SAID THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE TO POINT THIS IS WERE SPENDING THE MONEY RIGHT. SO THEN YOU HAVE YOU HIRED -- F. R. FORGOT HOW MANY STAFF. BE HIRED. NINE HUNDRED STAFF THANK YOU NEITHER STAFF DID RECEIVE TRAINING. THAT THEY WERE THE PRIMARY HOW MANY HOW MAY RECEIVE. I BELIEVE THE I DID INDICATE THAT 20% OF THE FOLKS THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT YOU HAD NOT. AND YOU'RE RIGHT LOOKING BACK IN PERSPECTIVE WE ARE HIRING QUICKLY. WE HAD A LARGE NUMBER OF ON FORTY WE DIDN'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF TRAINING SESSIONS THAT WE NEEDED FOR ACTON ROBIN ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO YOU. PART OF THAT ASK IS FOR MORE TRAINER SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT. BUT I THINK LONG TERM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT MODALITIES IT CAN'T JUST BE THIS THIS CLASSROOM DIDACTIC INSTRUCTION SO WE'RE LOOKING AT LEARNING MANAGEMENT ALL OF THAT IS IS IT'S PART OF OUR ASKING. I KNOW IT'S A IT'S A TOUGH TASK I I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT LOOK AT WHEN WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN THE THE VARIETIES OF THINGS BY. THE THE CHALLENGES IS THERE'S A COMPLETE LACK OF CONFIDENCE THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED AGAIN. YOUR I CAN DIRECTOR GAVE ALMOST THE IDENTICAL SPEECH THAT WAS GIVEN IN AUGUST [inaudible] ALMOST VERBATIM [inaudible] SO [inaudible] AGAIN. ALL I CAN DO IS THIS IS WHAT I HEARD LAST LAST TIME WE HAD THIS HEARING. IF WE GET THE SAME RESULT THAT'S COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE GONNA GET A DIFFERENCE ALL. ABSOLUTELY WITH MY NEW SHERRY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PLAN WILL HAVE THE STATISTICS IN THE MATRIX AND THE BENCH MARKING. ON MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR AND WE WILL HAVE -- A MUCH MORE ROBUST AND MORE THOROUGH AND REPLY. I'M I'M A TECH I MIGHT STRIKE FORCE PERSON I AM I'M SAYING THAT ON BEHALF OF THE OKAY BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT RATHER SECRETARY AND I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE THREE OF THEM AND BECAUSE CAN YOU CHECK AGAIN. THE ONLY PERSON WHO SAID THEY WERE DOING STUFF GUESS WHAT SHE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW. FROM LOOKING AT THE THREE DEPARTMENT PEOPLE FROM DEPARTMENT HOW DO WE INSURE THIS GETS DONE. I MEAN YOU HEARD THE AUDITOR OKAY THIS ABOUT LEADERSHIP THIS IS ABOUT YOUR TEAM. DOING THIS. THAT'S WHY I'M LOOKING AT THE THREE OF YOU OW DID THE THREE OF YOU GET THIS DONE. PRESSURE TEAM. I'M I'M I'M STILL WAITING FOR AN ANSWER SO. FIRST WERE WORKING ON THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WHICH WILL HAVE SOME MILESTONES AND I THINK YOU'LL SEE SOME SPECIFIC DATES. COMING OUT WITH THE CARS THE TARGETED ACTIVITY THAT WE'RE GONNA DRESS AND WHETHER THEY'LL BE DONE BY THE BY WHAT THEY DO MAY -- SIXTY DAYS WERE LOOKING AT AND THE MAIN THIS THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT SO SO I I I WOULD I WOULD. WRECK RECOMMEND YOU GET IT DONE BEFORE WE CLOSE DOWN OUR VERSION OF THE BUDGET BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT DONE BEFORE THEN IF IT'S NOT THEN TO OUR SATISFACTION. YOUR APPROPRIATION WELL I I WILL GUARANTEE IT WILL NOT BE IN OUR PERSONAL BUDGET. I WOULD SAY -- SECONDARILY -- WE HAVE DOCUMENTS THAT SUPPORTED THIS BUDGET REQUEST AND WE JUST NEED TO GO BACK AND PROVIDE YOU THE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. WITH OURS THE BUDGET REQUEST AND SO WE WILL WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WITH THE STAFF THERE WERE SO MANY INFORMATION AND PULL THE DETAILED INFORMATION FOR YOU. SUCH A RIGHT NOW THIS IS FAIR AS BUSIEST TIME OF THE YEAR SO SHE MAY NOT HAVE TIME. TO GO THROUGH THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL SO I'LL BE REVIEWING THAT [inaudible] AND I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO BE GOING BACK AND FORTH FOR MORE INFORMATION. SO MY REQUEST TO YOU IS. GIVE ME EVERYTHING YOU GOT. LET'S TRY TO DO IT ONE TIME. DOES THAT SOUND FAIR SOUNDS FAIR AND HAPPY TO MEET AND HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. AND HOW SOON CAN WE HAVE THE WHEN YOU WANT. I WANTED TO TODAY. I WANTED IT LIKE A WEEK AGO SO I CAN GET READY FOR THIS HEARING SO WE COULD APPROVE THE FORTY SIX MILLION YOU ASKED. FOR WE CAN'T DO THAT I'M GONNA SEND A LETTER TO JAIL B. C. TONIGHT. SO WHEN YES THAT'S WHAT I WANTED. SO IT'S A GREAT. SEVEN MILLION A QUICK. THIS FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN WE WERE DOING SB ONE WITH THE CALTRANS THE AGENCY WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE METRICS AND WHAT NOT. WE REQUIRE THEM ALSO BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO GET LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO BE [inaudible] EFFECTIVE. WAS THAT THEY HAD TO PROVIDE US WITH A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. I THINK IN YOUR PLAN YOU ALSO NEED TO SHOW WE'RE GONNA. CAPTURE EFFICIENCIES AND NOT JUST BE SPENDING LARGE AMOUNT OF MONIES TO BE CATCHING SO IT HAS TO BE BOTH WAYS -- AND AGAIN. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. I AM DISHEARTENED AT THE INFORMATION HAS AMBER BEEN PROVIDED AS EXPECTED -- BUT I THINK THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE YOU KNOW MY MY POSITION AS THE POLICY CHAIR IS. IS THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT MY CONSTITUENTS DESERVE FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING. AND IF I WAS TO DO A CASH BENEFIT ANALYSIS -- I WOULD LOOK AT ANOTHER WAITED FUND THIS. I WOULD LOOK AWAY ANOTHER WAY TO MAN THIS PROJECT -- COME FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I'M NOT GETTING A VALUE RIGHT NOW. AND SO IN THAT [inaudible] VEIN -- WE'VE ALSO IGNORE SOME LEGISLATION THAT. VENDORS WERE GAMING THE SYSTEM ON APPOINTMENTS. WERE HANDLING THAT -- MAKING SURE THAT. THAT LAWS CODIFIED CONCERNING LAW THE WHICH IS MAKING SURE WE CAN TRY TO MAKE SURE THIS AN EFFECTIVE USE OF YOUR APPOINTMENT SCHEDULE FOR THE CONSTITUENTS -- YOU GO TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING TO US -- WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN AND AS I SHARED WITH YOU I FULLY INTEND TO GO TO YOUR STAND DOWN. WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES. SHARE WITH THEM MY FAX NUMBER ONE BUT ALSO. HOPING THAT THEY RETURN THE FAVOR AND WORK WITH US. THAT THE CONSTITUENTS TO COME IN. HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND SO. AGAIN. IN SOLITARY LIMIT MY CHAIR I AM THERE I MEAN JUST I HAVE TO BE THERE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER -- YOUR OF YOUR THAT HERE THE FACE OF GOVERNMENT. I'VE SAID THAT BEFORE. AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT GETTING -- THE VALUE. AND I I JUST NEED REASSURANCES. BECAUSE AND OTHER AGENCIES IF THE REPORTS ARE LATE THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY THEY JUST BLOW US OFTEN. YOU KNOW I THINK CARP HAS ONE THAT WAS DOING DECEMBER AND NOW THEY'RE TELLING ME IT'S GONNA COME IN. AUGUST. I NEEDED THAT REPORT SO I COULD DO. OF A PROPER JOB AS THE CHAIRMAN OF OF JUDGING LEGISLATION GOING THROUGH. THEY'VE HAD THEY'VE TIED MY HANDS [inaudible] SO. WHAT HAPPENS IS IS? YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE PROBABLY. AND GOING TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS AND WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS JOB DOESN'T PAY. I KNOW IF MONEY. THE WERE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG I'VE GOT SIX MORE YEARS HERE SB TURNOVERS. I SAID THREE ONE IS IN A FINAL THOUGHT I'M. I THINK A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SHARED WITH YOU THAT DMV ISSUES AN DMP COMPLAINTS ARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE TOP OF THE LIST IN TERMS AS DISTRICT ISSUES NOT TRY MENTION THIS YESTERDAY BUT I'M THE ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE WE DID A SURVEY OF DISTRICT OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE. YOU PROBABLY WON'T SURPRISE YOU TO LEARN THAT -- EIGHTY ONE IN NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER. TWO COMPLAINT ITSELF. WELL NOW WE'VE GOT A BIG ISSUE AND I ALSO KNOW WHEN I WHEN I KNOWLEDGE THAT. THE BOTH OF YOU WERE WERE BROUGHT IN TO TRY TO WRITE A FOUNDERING SHIP. AND YOU KNOW. CALL THE PARKING AT A TIME WHEN PERHAPS THE SHIP WAS SINKING SO I DO APPRECIATE YOU STEPPING INTO THAT BREACH I'M. I THINK I'VE GOT. CAN OF THESE THREE REQUESTS LIKE FOR MY PERSPECTIVE I'M NUMBER ONE IS LIKE I SAID YOU A PROJECT PLAN FOR THE TOP FIVE PROJECTS WE DISCUSSED AND IN MY MIND AND GOD. GENTLEMAN FROM DMV IT'S IT'S NOT A MATTER OF MORE DETAIL THAN THIS IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT LETS US GO ARE WE ACTUALLY ON TRACK TO DELIVER THESE IN LARGE SCALE. BIG PROJECTS THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE AN ACTUAL ABLE TO DELIVER SO THAT'S ONE NUMBER TWO ON THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE I THINK WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT AND YOU SAID YOU HAD THAT THE FIVE YEAR. TECHNOLOGY PLAN. ISN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN DO IN THE SHORT TERM BUT I PERSONALLY THINK WE HAVE TO BE A LOT MORE AMBITIOUS THAN IT IT SOUNDS LIKE. WE DON'T HAVE FIVE YEARS TO REBUILD THIS PLATFORM IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME AND THE NUMBER THREE I WOULD LIKE. I AM TO SUGGEST A REQUEST A REVIEW OF THE MOTOR VOTER. PROGRAM AND THAT PERHAPS IS JUST THE INSTEON AUDIT THAT'S THAT'S ALREADY UNDERWAY BUT I WOULD LOVE TO RECEIVE A COPY OF THAT SO WE CAN. JUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO UNDERLYING ISSUES THERE THAT ALSO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED I SAID. THAT WOULD BE MY PARTING THREE REQUESTS ISING BEFORE IT THANKS THANK YOU. SO I THINK JUST TO SUMMARIZE. WE HAVE A BUDGET REQUEST AT THIS POINT IS LACKING [inaudible] HOME. THIS IS THE COMPLETE DEFINITION OF INSANITY AND WANT TO QUOTE OUR GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE USED THIS QUOTE QUITE OFTEN WHEN HE WAS MAYOR. THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY AS WE ALL KNOW IS DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT. SO WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THAT MISTAKE. SO AGAIN WE'RE ASKING THE DMV. TO TAKE THAT FEEDBACK TO TAKE THE CUSTOMER'S FEEDBACK TO KEEP ALL THESE THINGS AND I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S SAD IS. IN THE TOUGHEST PART FOR ME IS I DON'T I JUST DON'T KNOW IF YOU IN THE CENTRAL OFFICE REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE DIFFERENT FIELD OFFICE? BECAUSE WHEN I'M THERE AND I'LL TELL YOU MY COLLEAGUES WILL REITERATE I I SEE A LOT OF HARD WORKING PEOPLE. THEY ARE WORKING REALLY HARD THEY GOT LINES. OUT THE DOOR THEY'RE JUST TRYING. TO SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE. MANY OF WHOM ARE VERY UPSET BECAUSE OF OF HOW LONG THE LINES ARE AND THINGS THAT ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE CONTROL OF OF THE STAFF. AND AND THEY DO THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN A WE CAN'T SIT HERE FROM OUR COMFORTABLE PLACE AND SACRAMENTO STATE THAT'S OKAY. TO CONTINUE THAT. WHAT YOU'VE PUT TOGETHER AS A PLAN? HAS DEMONSTRATED TO ME. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING. TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. IN THE FIELD OFFICE. SO WHEN YOU PUT TOGETHER A PLAN THAT SAYS IN DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU'VE HEARD US. BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD OUR CONSTITUENTS. WE HEAR THE I GO TO THE GROCERY STORE I GET THIS. I GO ON PUBLIC I GET THIS I MEAN YOU PROBABLY NONE OF YOU I DON'T KNOW LAST ME THAT ANY OF YOU WERE STOPPED AT A GROCERY STORE TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE. SO SO FAR AS A FINANCE TO SAY YES. THANK THAT'S GOOD. THAT DEMONSTRATES THE THOUGHTFULNESS. TO REALLY GO AND ATTACK THIS ISSUE. THESE FIELD OFFICES ARE UNDER SIEGE THEY'RE JUST IS LESS LIKE THEY'RE LIKE AN EMERGENCY ROOM THEY'RE JUST TRIAGE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. JUST CONTINUES THAT [inaudible] ATTITUDE. JUST CONTINUES THAT BUSINESS AS USUAL TRIAGE AND IS THE SAME OLD SAME. IT DOESN'T GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO. IT DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU YOU HEARD US DEPLOYING. THE VARIETIES OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. ANOTHER NEW DIRECTORS ONLY THAT CONVERTS ONLY BEEN THERE FOR A FEW MONTHS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S SO I THINK YOU YOU KNOW YOU HAVE EXCUSE BUT THE REST THE TO YOUR TEAM HASN'T. ONLY BEEN FOR TWO MONTHS. AND THE OTHER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN SACRAMENTO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR JUST [inaudible] TWO MONTHS SO THIS. HOUSE TO CHANGE. HAS TO CHANGE -- KIND OF WE HAVE TO TAKE MORE DRASTIC MEASURES THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT. YOU HEARD MISS SMITH. IT OUT OF THE BOX IDEA LET'S [inaudible] DECENTRALIZED. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
