SPEAKER- WE TO DO NOT TO BILLS

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:49.013
THAT'S A PERFECT BUT WE THINK

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.581
IT PROVIDES CRITICAL.

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.216
PROTECTIONS THAT MUST BE

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:55.720

BILLIONS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.661

IT'S GOING VERY SLOWLY. THAT'S

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:09.667
THE LYNCHPIN OF ALL OF THIS SO

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:10.434
WHILE WE EXTEND THESE

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.537

GIVEN THE PACE IN WHICH THOSE

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:32.590
DOLLARS ARE GOING OUT. I THINK

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:33.991
IT'S CRITICAL THAT AS WE MOVE

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:35.359

BECAUSE IN FACT THERE'S BEEN A

00:45:32.696 --> 00:45:34.398
AND I'VE ARGUED FROM THE VERY

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.232
BEGINNING THAT THE WAY TO DEAL

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:37.835
WITH THIS WAS TO PROVIDE THE

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:38.368

THIS OUT THERE FROM THE FEDERAL

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:06.663
AND STATE LEVEL- THAT IT'S IT

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:07.764
APPEARS TO ME IN APPEARANCE

00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:08.932
FROM THE DATA FROM THE AMOUNT

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:09.500
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:11.401

PEOPLE ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING.

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.151
AND MY PROBLEM ALSO FROM THE

00:46:27.217 --> 00:46:29.219
BEGINNING HAS BEEN. THERE'S NO

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:30.687
ONE HERE REPRESENTING THE SMALL

00:46:30.754 --> 00:46:33.891
MOM AND POP LANDLORDS. AND SO I

CONTINUE TO TRY AND SPEAK FOR

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:36.226
THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:37.995
LOBBYIST TO SHOW UP AS A YEAH

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:43.967
GETTING SHORT CHANGED. FOR NOW

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:46.336
FIFTEEN MONTHS ON RENT. AND

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:48.305
HAVE NOTHING TO DO ABOUT IT AND

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:49.706
THEN IT AND ACCORDING TO THIS

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:50.974
ONLY FIVE THOUSAND FOREIGN

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:52.209
TWENTY TWO APPLICANTS LESS THAN

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:53.577
5% OF THE MONEY HAS ACTUALLY

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:55.712
BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. TO SMALL

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:57.047
MOM AND POP LANDLORDS THIS

00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:58.615
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THIS IS SOME

00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:01.018
HUGE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM- THAT

00:47:01.084 --> 00:47:02.886

AND THAT. YOU KNOW HERE HERE

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:06.957
COMES A CLIFF IF WE DON'T

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:08.392
APPROVE IT THAT JUST DOESN'T

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:10.594
APPEAR TO BE THE CASE. AND I

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:11.161
WON'T EVEN GET INTO HOW WE

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:12.829
STARTED THIS WHOLE THING IT

00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:14.698
WASN'T US IT WAS ACTUALLY THE

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:16.066
GOVERNOR BY EXECUTIVE ORDER WHO

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:18.035
CHANGE LANDLORD TENANT LAW

00:47:18.101 --> 00:47:19.436
OVERNIGHT. WHICH I DON'T KNOW

HOW MANY TIMES I GOT A HARP ON

00:47:20.804 --> 00:47:21.605
THAT BUT IT'S A BIG PROBLEM

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.240
THAT THE EXECUTIVE IS CHANGING

00:47:23.307 --> 00:47:25.309
YOUR LAWS. AND WE HAD NOTHING

00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:27.945
TO SAY ABOUT IT- AND THAT IS A

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:29.680
JUDICIAL COUNCIL DECIDED TO SAY

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:32.115
HEY COURTS. NO YOU CAN'T DO

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:34.084
YOUR JOB OF EXECUTING THE LAW.

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:34.751
ALL THESE THINGS ARE

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.853
PROBLEMATIC AND AGAIN I JUST

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.056
DON'T SEE. THE NEED TO CONTINUE

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:41.491
THIS MORATORIUM. SUPPOSEDLY

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:43.694
CALIFORNIA'S RE OPENED YOU KNOW

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.562

00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:48.498
REOPENED OR BACK TO BUSINESS

00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:50.500
BUSINESSES OPEN AGAIN PEOPLE

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.805
WE'RE DOING SO GREAT THE

00:47:54.871 --> 00:47:57.107
ECONOMY IS JUST GOING TO GANG

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:58.609
BUSTERS BUT NO WE DESPERATELY

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:02.212
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USING AGAIN

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:04.381
LESS THAN 5% OF THE MONEY BEING

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:05.682
EXPENDED AND I WONDER IF THAT'S

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:07.284
ACTUALLY THE CASE LET'S

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:09.386

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.359
WERE ALLOCATED TO HELP PEOPLE.

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:16.560
WITH RIGHT RELIEF AND THEN

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:17.928
ACTUALLY NONE OF THAT MONEY

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:19.763
ACTUALLY GETS OUT. TO HELP

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.266
PEOPLE RIGHT IT'S SO VERY GAVIN

00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:24.935
NEWSOM. ANNOUNCE A BIG PROGRAM

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:28.071
NOTHING GETS REALLY EXECUTED-

00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:28.639
BUT WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO

00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:30.741
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS. YOU KNOW

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:33.477
THIS IS GREAT POLICY IT'S NOT

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:33.977
AND I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:39.783
ANYMORE. THIS GONZALEZ. I WANT

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.551
TO THANK YOU- FOR WORKING ON

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:45.989
THIS I A I A REPRESENT A- LARGE

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:47.557
QUESTION MY DISTRICT TO RENTERS

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:49.459
I ALSO HAVE A LARGE PORTION OF

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:50.227
A DISTRICT THAT WAS HIGHLY

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:52.529
AFFECTED NOT BY STATE HOME

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:53.697
ORDERS WITH THE FACT THAT THERE

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.465
ARE- SERVICE WORKERS IN THE

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:57.501
TOURISM INDUSTRY AND DESPITE

00:48:57.567 --> 00:48:58.935
OPENING BACK UP THAT DOESN'T

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.637
MEAN THINGS GET BACK TO NORMAL

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:01.538
RIGHT AWAY DOESN'T MEAN

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:04.241
EVERYBODY'S- BEING HIRED BACK.

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:06.810
AND I ALSO HAVE A HIGH NUMBER

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:08.612
OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO ARE

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.881
UNDOCUMENTED AND QUITE FRANKLY-

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:12.649
SOMETIMESHAD TO STOP WORKING

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:15.986
BECAUSE A CO ED- AND WE'RE

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:18.221
STRUGGLING TO PAY THE RENT THIS

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.157
IS NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:21.725
EVERYBODY SEEMS A LITTLE HAPPY

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.593
IN A LITTLE UPSET THAT PROBABLY

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.762
MEANS IT'S THE RIGHT SOLUTION-

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.798
AND IT DOES PROVIDE A HUNDRED

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:32.669
PERCENT- RECLAIMING OF AS MANY

00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:34.171
FOR THE LANDLORDS AND THAT'S

00:49:34.237 --> 00:49:34.971
IMPORTANT AS WELL WE DON'T WANT

00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:38.208
PEOPLE LOSING- THEIR THEIR

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:39.976
RENTAL PROPERTIES WE DON'T WANT

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:41.845
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES. SO

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:43.914
HAVING GONE OUT WITH MY STAFF

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:44.915

00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:46.717
FORMS I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:48.318
WAS A DAUNTING EXPERIENCE

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:50.554
THERE'S A REASON SO LITTLE OF

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.022
THIS MONEY HAS GONE OUT IN

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:53.757
ANYONE WHO HAS ACTUALLY GONE

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:55.359
OUT AND TALKED TO CONSTITUENTS

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:56.993

00:49:58.695 --> 00:49:59.696
HOURS TO TRY TO FILL OUT THESE

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:01.298
FORMS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:02.999
APPLY FOR THE MONEY KNOWS THE

00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:04.668
BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES WE'RE

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.570
DEALING WITH AND SOME OF IT NOT

00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:08.171
BECAUSE OF US BUT BECAUSE THE

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:08.605
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:10.674

THE RENTAL RELIEF SO- IS A

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:14.444
PERFECT YOU KNOW WILL KEEP

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:17.114
PEOPLE FROM BEING DISPLACED AND

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.849
GROWING- NUMBER OF HOMELESS

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:20.817
ABSOLUTELY IT WILL AND I THINK

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:21.918
THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:22.652
WE'RE TRYING TO PUT SO MUCH

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:25.555
MONEY INTO ENDING HOMELESSNESS-

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:27.224
THE LAST THING WE WANT IS FOR

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.692
MORE FAMILIES BE HOMELESS AND

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:31.728

CONSTITUENTS ARE FACING. AND

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:45.909
THE VERY REAL DYNAMIC OF NOT

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:47.911
BEING ABLE TO PAY BACK RENT AND

THE LAST FEW WEEKS I DO WANNA

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.095
RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF POINTS

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:40.297
THAT WERE RAISED ACROSS THE

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:42.232
AISLE IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:44.668
NOT SEEN. THE WAVE OF ACTIONS

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:46.102
THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:47.604
AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE PUT

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.940
THESE PROTECTIONS AND THAT IS

00:51:50.006 --> 00:51:52.275
BECAUSE WHEN THE COURT-

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:54.244

EIGHT IT IS BECAUSE- AND- I

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:04.054
THINK BEFORE OUR CALL THE CAME

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.856
INTO THIS COMMITTEE HEARING I'D

00:52:05.922 --> 00:52:07.190
MENTION A COUPLE THE STATISTICS

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:10.060
THAT JUST THIS MONTH ONE POINT

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:10.927
SEVEN FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIA

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.596
RENTAL HOUSEHOLDS REPORTED TO

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.464
THE CENSUS. SLIDER NO

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:15.866
CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:17.501
PAY THE NEXT MONTH'S RENT THE

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.803
RECENT POLICY LIKE ANALYSIS

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:20.270
NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:21.638
HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE BEHIND ON

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:22.672
THEIR RENT AND THEIR STATISTICS

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.274
ON HOW FAR THEY ARE BEHIND ON

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:26.176
THE RENT WE KNOW THAT WHILE NOT

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:26.910
EVERYONE IS STRUGGLING AT THIS

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:29.012
MOMENT WE STILL HAVE MANY

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:31.047
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE BEHIND-

00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:32.516
AND LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT

00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:33.383
THAT MONIES HAVING GONE OUT

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.752
FIRST OF ALL. IT IS TRUE A VERY

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.521
SMALL FRACTION OF CHECKS HAVE

00:52:37.587 --> 00:52:38.755
ACTUALLY GOTTEN IN THE HANDS OF

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:39.656
STRUGGLING TENANTS AND

00:52:39.723 --> 00:52:41.491
LANDLORDS BUT MANY FOLKS OF

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:42.792
APPLIED THEIR APPLICATIONS ARE

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:44.895
LITERALLY PENDING AND SO THE

00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:45.896
IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE WOULD

00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:47.497
ALLOW THE ACTIONS TO START AND

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:49.065
THREE DAYS WHILE FOLKS ARE

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:50.467
WAITING TO SEE WHETHER THEIR

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:51.735
APPLICATIONS WILL BE APPROVED I

00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:53.703
THINK WOULD BE CHALLENGING- I

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:54.704
WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:55.972
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ASKED A LOT

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.841
WHY THE DISBURSEMENT HAS BEEN

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.676
SO CHALLENGING. IT'S BEEN A

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:01.478
NUMBER OF REASONS- FIRST OF ALL

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:03.280
THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM IT WAS

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:05.348
JUST SET UP A FEW MONTHS AGO WE

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:06.983
ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:07.751
SET UP NEW PROGRAMS

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:10.453
PARTICULARLY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.888
CONFLICTING AND SHIFTING

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:13.156
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE COMING

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:14.024
DOWN FROM THE FEDERAL

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.292
GOVERNMENT FROM THE STATE

00:53:15.358 --> 00:53:16.326
GOVERNMENT AND FOR MANY

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:18.528
JURISDICTIONS AROUND CALIFORNIA

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:19.296
SO FEDERAL STATE LOCAL

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:20.964
PROVISIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN

00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:22.265
CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:23.934
EDUCATING MILLIONS OF TENANTS

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.635
AND LANDLORDS CHALLENGES AROUND

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:27.103
LANGUAGE ACCESS CHALLENGES

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.105
AROUND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- AND

00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:30.874
CHALLENGES FRANKLY IN THE

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:32.175
COMPLICATED APPLICATION THAT

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:34.144
HAS JUST BEEN STREAMLINED AGAIN

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.512
THIS PAST MONTH SO THESE ARE

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:37.080
ALL THINGS THAT HAVE LED TO

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.381
WHERE WE ARE TODAY BUT THE FACT

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:40.150
OF THE MATTER IS WE'RE SITTING

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:41.952
ON OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:43.887
RENTAL ASSISTANCE. THAT COULD

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:45.021
GO TO FOLKS WERE STRUGGLING AND

00:53:45.088 --> 00:53:46.389
AGAIN THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD

00:53:46.456 --> 00:53:47.624
TURN ON THE FICTION SPIGOT IN

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.392
THREE DAYS- WHEN WE COULD HELP

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:51.962
THESE FOLKS IS NOT ONE THAT I

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:55.165
THINK MAKES SENSE- I KNOW OUR

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:56.299
COLLEAGUES. ACROSS THE AISLE

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:57.767
TALKED ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD

00:53:57.834 --> 00:53:59.436
FOCUS ON PROVIDING RELIEF FOR

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:01.104
THOSE WHO NEED IT AND- THAT'S

00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:02.906
EXACTLY WHAT. THIS BILL

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:04.441
ENVISIONS THIS BILL ENVISIONS

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:05.542
THAT POTENTIALLY IN THREE

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:07.310
MONTHS ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH.

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:09.746
EVICTIONS WILL BEGIN AGAIN. AND

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:11.948
WHAT IT ALSO SAYS IS THERE ARE

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:14.818
PROTECTIONS. FOR TENANTS WHO

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.319
HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE FINANCIAL

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:17.787
SYSTEMS THAT THEY MIGHT.

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:19.889
REQUIRE THEIR PROTECTIONS WHEN

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:21.091
OF ACTION START TO BE ABLE TO

00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:23.159
DO THAT AND THAT IS- WERE

00:54:23.226 --> 00:54:24.361
REALLY LITERALLY TRYING TO

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:26.563
ENVISION WHAT- WHAT WAS

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:27.130
SUGGESTED AND HOW WE SHOULD

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:28.898
STRUCTURE THIS. I KNOW TERE'S

00:54:28.965 --> 00:54:30.133
ALSO BEEN SOME SUGGESTION THAT

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.301
THERE ARE TENANTS OUT THERE

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:34.270
WHO- COULD AFFORD TO PAY- BUT

00:54:34.337 --> 00:54:35.438
IF NOT IN A FEW THINGS I WOULD

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:37.874
JUST LIKE TO MENTION. IS AT

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.315
PASSED TO ALLOW LANDLORDS TO

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:21.685

ABOUT- THAT THERE IS- THERE IS

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:50.747
RECOURSE THERE BUT I WOULD JUST

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:51.815

AREA MEDIAN INCOME WHICH WOULD

00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:00.724

00:56:02.058 --> 00:56:03.960

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.072
IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE WOULD TURN
