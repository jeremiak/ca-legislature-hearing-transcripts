CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:34.178
WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW. I FEEL

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:36.247
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE-

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:38.282
REPRESENTING TEN OF MY ELEVEN

K. PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY. I

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:48.092
UNDERSTAND THIS BILL DOESN'T

SPECIFICALLY SPEAK TO MAKE SURE

K. BUT TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE A

00:33:51.295 --> 00:33:52.964
WORKAROUND IT LOOKS LIKE THE

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.032
VOTERS VOTED WE DIDN'T LIKE IT

00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:56.234
SO IN SACRAMENTO WE'RE GONNA

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.102
TELL THEM WHAT THEY SHOULD DO.

00:33:58.169 --> 00:33:59.137
IT ALSO MAKES YOU FEEL A LITTLE

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:00.905

GET THE OUTCOME THAT THEY WANT.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:12.984
I DO BELIEVE THAT A ONE TERM

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.153
TERM LIMIT IS TERRIBLE AND IT

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.888

THE EXPERTISE. BUT IT I ALSO

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:20.591

PERCEPTION IS OUR REALITY. AND

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:16.207
I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:17.675
NOT SEE IT AND KNOW THAT IT'S

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:19.644
