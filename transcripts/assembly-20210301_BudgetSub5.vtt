CHANGES LIKE I SAID EARLIER.

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.217

THREE BROAD POINTS. NUMBER ONE.

COLLEAGUES FROM THOSE VIDEOS

YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:54.530
CREDIBILITY PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:57.500
ON THIS ISSUE GIVEN WHAT WE

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:59.001
WERE TOLD TWO YEARS AGO WHEN WE

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:01.303
APPROVE THIS MONEY HOW IT WAS

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.105
USED AND THE STANDARD THAT WAS

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:06.308
SET UP. TO USE THIS MONEY AND

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:11.380
TO ADDRESS. YOU MAKE COMPLAINTS

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:15.284
ABOUT STAFF ACTIONS IS JUST

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:20.422
ASTONISHING TO ME THAT THE.

01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:22.825
EXCUSE OF IT BEING COMPLICATED

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.528
WHEN REALLY YOU IT SEEMS LIKE

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.997
THE SYSTEM WAS SET UP. WITH TOO

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.932
MANY GATES TO ENSURE THE

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.267
COMPLAINTS AND NEVER GOT TO THE

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:34.770
UNIT. AND NOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.940
ASKING US FOR MORE MONEY. TO

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:40.943
PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR A SYSTEM

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.945
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:44.914
OVERSIGHT OVER COMPLAINT DRIVEN

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:48.684
SYSTEM. AND BY THAT JUST BY THE

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:52.187
NUMBER. THAT THE INSPECTOR

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:55.824
GENERAL REPORTS. A FIFTH OR

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:58.894
LESS OF THE EXPECTED ACTIVITY

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.496
HAPPENED WITH WHAT WE WERE

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:03.832
FUNDING. SO I HAVE TO ASK IN

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:05.668
THIS IS PROBABLY THE LEAST

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:07.303
SIGNIFICANT QUESTION IS WHERE

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:10.005
DID THE REST OF THE MONEY GO.

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:12.474
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AND SO

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.010
THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE THAT.

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.812
THAT IF WE ALLOCATE MONEY FOR

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.781
SOMETHING AND IT'S CLEARLY NOT

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:20.583
BEING SPENT THEIR IT IT'S BEEN

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:23.852
SPENT SOMEPLACE ELSE. WHEN YOU

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:24.386
COME BACK AND ASK FOR MORE

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:27.389
MONEY FOR SOMETHING. IT'S

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:27.856
REALLY HARD FOR US TO

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:31.026
UNDERSTAND. AND HAVE CONFIDENCE

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:33.929
THAT THAT MONEY WILL BE SPENT

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:35.531
ON ON HOW IT'S HOW YOU'RE

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:39.034
SAYING. I'M NOT SURE THIS

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:41.770
COMMITTEE SHOULD ALLOW. MORE

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:45.841
MONEY TO FIX THE PROBLEM THAT

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:48.210
SHOULDN'T HAVE ARISEN IN THIS

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:51.447
WAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.247
THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE FOR ME

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:53.816
SITTING HERE RIGHT HERE NOW I

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:55.951
KNOW YOU CAN BE WORKING WITH-THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:58.721
ANOTHER SOME PROCESSES THAT

01:10:58.787 --> 01:10:59.321
THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:03.792
TO BE CLEANED UP. SO FOR. HOW

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:06.462
MAY BE WILLING TO SPEND MORE

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.797
MONEY IN THIS AREA I THINK WE

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:10.366
REALLY REALLY NEED TO

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:13.435
UNDERSTAND HOW. THIS IS GOING

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:16.572
TO BE FIXED. AND IT'S FAIRLY

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:21.143
CLEAR. THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:23.479
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY OF

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:24.713
SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.883
WARDENS TO HEAD OFF A COMPLAINT.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.252
AND MAKE IT SEEM INSIGNIFICANT

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:33.656
WHEN IT MIGHT BE. AND SO YOU

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:36.058
YOU'VE GOT VARIOUS LEVELS OF

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.727
ACTUAL INTERFERENCE. WITH A

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:42.498
PROCESS THAT YOU DESIGN. AND

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:45.868
THAT WAS SOLD TO US AS BEING

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:46.402
WORTHY OF SOME ADDITIONAL

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:49.304
FUNDING. WITH THE RHETORIC

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:51.340
THAT. WE SEEM TO HAVE HAD

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:55.344
AGREEMENT. ON WHAT WAS MOVING

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:57.279
FORWARD AND HOW IN THE AND THAT

01:11:57.346 --> 01:12:00.182
TURNED OUT TO BE JUST NOT TRUE

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:02.618
SO I'M REALLY STRUGGLING RIGHT

01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:05.721
NOW. WITH HOW WE CAN MOVE

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:09.224
FORWARD. AND HOW YOU ARE GOING

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:12.561
TO BE ABLE TO SET UP A SYSTEM.

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:16.065
GIVEN THEIR INTERNALCULTURE

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:18.701
AND THE PROTECTIVE NATURE OF

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:19.835
YOUR POINT CURRENT EMPLOYMENT

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:23.305
STRUCTURE. THAT SEEMS TO

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:27.142
PREDETERMINE. OUTCOMES FROM

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:29.411
COMPLAINTS OR TO DISMISS

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:33.449
COMPLAINTS. ARBITRARILY WITHOUT

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:35.617
GIVING ANY REAL SERIOUS

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:38.353
CONSIDERATION TO WHAT TRULY

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.222
HAPPENED AND WHAT THE REMEDIES

01:12:40.289 --> 01:12:44.626
ARE GOING TO BE. SO HOW ARE YOU

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:47.663
GOING TO. BE ABLE TO CONVINCE

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:53.135
US N. AND HOW TO RECOVER THE

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:56.705
CREDIBILITY HERE. IN A WAY THAT

01:12:56.772 --> 01:13:00.876
THAT WE CAN. BOB IS REALLY

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:01.477
TRYING TO FIND A PATH TO MOVE

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:05.047
FORWARD WITH ALL OF THIS AND I

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.148
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THOSE

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:09.284
CHANGES MADE AND MADE NOW.

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:10.886
BEFORE YOU GONNA COME BACK TO

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.321
US TO ASK FOR MORE INFO FOR

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:14.823
MORE MONEY BECAUSE IT JUST

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.092
LOOKS TO ME LIKE MONEY THAT HAD

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:19.261
BEEN SPENT. FOR THE MONEY THAT

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:22.097
WE GAVE YOU HAS BEEN MISSPENT.

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:23.899
AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE

01:13:23.966 --> 01:13:25.768
THIS PROCESS FIXED. AND FIXED

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:30.439
RIGHT AWAY. AND IN A WAY THAT

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:33.675
THAT IS TRACEABLE IS AUDIBLE IS

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:37.112
MANAGEABLE. AND THAT YOU CAN

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:42.317
SHOW SOME SIGNIFICANT OUTCOMES.

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:44.620
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE TO

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:46.822
SUGGEST AS A WAY OF KIND OF

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:47.356
GETTING BACK SOME OF THAT

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:49.158
CREDIBILITY TO ME WHEN I READ

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:50.626
THIS I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT AND

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:52.194
THEN JUST SITTING HERE

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.962
LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY. AND

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:55.564
THINKING BACK TO THE HEARINGS

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:57.666
FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I'M

MEETING AND WE'RE IDENTIFYING

01:23:29.904 --> 01:23:33.475
VERY CRITICAL PIECES TO FIX AND

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:34.843
THOSE WITH THE TOP THREE THAT

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:37.112
WERE IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:38.279
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:39.814
WE'RE GOING TO VOLUME WISE

HANDLE THE LOAD BECAUSE I HAVE

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.685
TO TRAIN STAFF THIS TRAINING

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:45.720
CRITICAL COMPONENT I HAVE TO

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:46.721
MAKE SURE THAT THE STAFF

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:49.457

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:50.825
CHOIRS ARE THOROUGHLY TRAINED

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:54.696
SO THAT THEY. CAN BE HANDLED IN

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:55.697
A PROPER MANNER. WHAT WILL YOU

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.132
WEAR OF THE ISSUE PRIOR TO THIS

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.234
GENERAL'S REPORT BEING RELEASED.

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.302
HE YES WE HAD SOME INDEPENDENT

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:05.540
REVIEWS GOING ON- THROUGH OUR-

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:08.143
COOKS CORRECTIONAL RESEARCH

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.711
CORRECTION POLICY RESEARCH AN

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:12.147
INTERNAL OVERSIGHT UNIT. WAS

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:14.282
DOING INDEPENDENT REVIEWS AND

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:16.251
DISCOVERED SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:17.852
CONCERNS AND THEY HAD ALREADY

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:20.422
RECOMMENDED. THAT WE CHANGE

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:22.090
SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS.

01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:26.060
WARDENS I WILL SAY THAT THE

01:24:26.127 --> 01:24:27.896
WARDENS WERE MADE THERE WAS NO

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:29.631
EVIDENCE FOUND THAT THE WARDENS

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:32.534
WERE NOT APPROPRIATELY APPLYING

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.501
WHAT WE GAVE THEM WITHIN THE

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:35.103
PARAMETERS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.905
PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH THAT

01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:38.840
DEFINITION THAT MAY LEAD TO

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.543
ADVERSE ACTION. WHAT WAS THE

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:43.912
NUMBER ONE AREA OF CONCERN- BUT

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.313
WE DIDN'T FIND WATER BORDERS

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:47.148
pWERE INTENTIONALLY NOT

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:49.417
FORWARDING CASES ON THAT IS NOT

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:51.319
WHAT WE FOUND IT WAS HONESTLY

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:53.721
THAT. THE PROCESS WAS TOO

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:55.156
COMPLICATED THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:56.758
ENOUGH INFORMATION SO

01:24:56.825 --> 01:24:58.326
DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:00.528
HAVING A OUTSIDE SCREENER AND

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:02.564
THEN. GIVING THEM GOOD

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:09.037

AN- PROCESS THAT WILL BE

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:20.882
IMPLEMENTED. I'M THIS IS WHAT

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.350
I'M GOING TO SAY BECAUSE I

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.985
THINK WE HAVE TO HIRE SOME

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:28.223
STAFF- AND GET THEM TRAINED SO.

01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:29.657

OUR INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:53.741
BEEN REFERRED. SOMETIMES EVEN

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.209
OUTSIDE OF AN ALLEGATION CHOIR

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:56.978
SOMETIMES WARDENS HAVE ENOUGH

01:26:57.045 --> 01:27:00.548
TO FORWARD AND INCIDENTS- FOR

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:02.684
ADVERSE ACTION DIRECTLY OUTSIDE

PROCESSING YOU YOU HAD

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:13.194
MENTIONED THAT OBVIOUSLY TAKES

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:16.831
TIME- THE STATE'S TRADITIONALLY

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:17.966
STRUGGLED WITH PUTTING

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:20.435
TOGETHER- DATABASES- I. T.

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.769
PROJECT I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG A

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.671
PROJECT THIS IS THE YOU

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.773
ENVISIONED HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.008
THINK YOU IT WOULD TAKE TO COME

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.009
UP WITH A CENTRALIZED DATA

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:33.314
PROCESS. OUR SYSTEM. YES I

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.782
WOULD AGREE THAT'S PROBABLY THE

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:41.289
MOST COMPLEX- PROCESS AND- TO

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:44.292
BE ANY KIND OF ID PROCESS AND

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:45.393
SHE SAID I'VE BEEN AROUND A

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:48.162
LONG TIME- IT TAKES A LONG TIME

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:49.731
TO GET THAT DONE I

01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:52.233
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.935
HOPEFULLY HAVE SOMETHING UNDER

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:56.170
WAY WITH PLANNING OF DEPLOYMENT

01:27:56.237 --> 01:28:00.341
BY THE END OF MAY OF. OUR

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:00.908
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT JUST

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:02.143
OCCUR IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE IT

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:05.179
JUST A SIMPLER. DATABASE I MEAN

01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:06.981
I'M NOT RECOMMENDING LIKE.

01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:09.484
EXCEL OR ACCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:10.885
A WAY TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:13.655
MORE. OFF THE SHELF AND HOW TO

01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:16.391
DO SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:20.261
PRETTY TIME INTENSIVE. NOT THE

01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:21.763
BEST PERSON TO ANSWER THAT IS

01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:23.865
I'M NOT A COMPUTER EXPERT BY

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:27.301
ANY MEANS- AND I MAYBE MISS

01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:29.170
MILLER HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:30.338
TO ASSESS THE FLOOR FURTHER

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:32.740
THAN I HAVE- SO I'M GONNA AND

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:34.776
ASKING ME TO. PROVIDE THIS

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:36.244
INFORMATION AND GOOD AFTERNOON

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:39.580
ASSEMBLYMEMBER TANG- SO THE IT

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:41.115
THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR

01:28:41.182 --> 01:28:42.417
TRACKING ALLEGATIONS THAT AN

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.318
INSTITUTION IS DONE ON A LOCAL

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:46.254
ALLOCATION LOG IN UP TO THIS

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.555
POINT IT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN A

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:50.491
PRETTY SIMPLE- SPREADSHEET IF

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:51.959
YOU WELL- THE UNFORTUNATE

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:53.161
REALITY IS YOU COULDN'T

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:54.595
ACTUALLY CROSS REFERENCE ANY

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:56.631
INFORMATION IT. IT DIDN'T HAVE

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:58.766
WHAT YOU NEEDED TO DO THAT- THE

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:00.435
OTHER COMPLICATED PIECE OF THIS

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:03.104
IS THAT WE ACTUALLY. KEEP

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:03.571
INFORMATION IN SEVERAL

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:05.506
DIFFERENT DATABASES. WITH THAT

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:06.507
SAID THE DIVISION OF ADULT

01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:07.975
INSTITUTIONS IN OUR ENTERPRISE

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.610
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND OTHERS

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:10.945
HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.647
THEY'RE WORKING OUT AN I. T.

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:14.348
SOLUTIONS. IDEALLY IT WOULD

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:16.217
HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACTIVATED BUT

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:17.785
UNFORTUNATELY WITH CO THAT

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:20.621
RESOURCES WERE WORTH- MOVE

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:22.256
OTHER PLACES OVER THE LAST

01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:23.591
YEAR- AND SO I ASK THIS

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:26.027
PANDEMIC. STARTS TO TWO THINGS

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:28.129
START TO GET BETTER- THE

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.131
SECRETARY HAS COMMITTED TO

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.499
MAKING SURE THAT THE RESOURCES

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:33.134
ARE AVAILABLE TO GET THAT I. T.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.136
SOLUTION IN PLACE AND SO-

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.071
ALREADY THERE'S ACTIVITY ON

YOU THINK THAT DEPARTMENT CANBE DOING STARTING TOMORROW

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:09.463
BEFORE MADE AT THE COULD BE

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.132
IMPLEMENTED TO CREATE A BETTER

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.366
SYSTEM WHAT CAN WHAT ARE

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:12.967
IMMEDIATE THINGS WE COULD DO

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:15.303
NOW IN YOUR- IN YOUR OPINION

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:17.538
HERE. WELL I THINK THE

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:19.407
SECRETARY ADDRESSED SOME OF

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:21.909
THOSE THINGS- AGAIN WE HAD A

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:24.679
DISCUSSION LAST WEEK- GETTING

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.380
THE INSTITUTIONS OUT OF THE

01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:31.953
PROCESS. IS A BIG PART OF THAT-

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:36.090
ELIMINATING THE OFF RAMPS FOR-

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:40.294
INCREASE TO BE DUMPED AND OF

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:42.997
SETTING UP A PROCESS WHERE-

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:45.499
REPORTS CAN BE RUN AND DATA CAN

01:31:45.566 --> 01:31:49.070
BE CAPTURED TO ASSESS HOW THE

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:51.038
PROGRAM IS WORKING ARE HUGE

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:56.444
STEPS AND I THINK THOSE ARE-

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.044
PROBABLY THE MAJOR THINGS THAT

01:31:57.111 --> 01:32:03.284
NEED TO BE DONE. IT CAN I MEAN

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.019
CAN ALL THESE COMPLAINTS JUST

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:11.492
BE SENT DIRECTLY TO AIMS NOW. I

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.461
AYE SINGLE IMPEDIMENT TO THAT

01:32:13.527 --> 01:32:16.364
THE THERE HAS TO BE A PLACE

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:18.599
THAT AIMS FOR THEM TO GO. BUT I

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:21.969
THINK THAT- THE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:32:22.036 --> 01:32:24.739
A VERY GOOD MODEL IN ITS- IN

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:28.442
ITS- OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:32.246
FOR HAVING A CENTRAL- REVIEW OF

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:34.916
ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. SO I

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:37.451
DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY CAN'T

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:40.888
OTHER THAN- ASSIGNING THE

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:43.024
DUTIES. HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:46.961

02:07:29.808 --> 02:07:31.176
RESOURCES REQUESTED FOR THE

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:32.244
COMMISSION ON CORRECTIONAL

02:07:32.311 --> 02:07:33.245
PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND

02:07:33.312 --> 02:07:35.447
TRAINING OR SEATPOST. WE THINK

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:36.982
THAT THE RESOURCES WOULD BETTER

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:38.283
POSITION SUPPOSED TO FILL ITS

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:39.718
LEGISLATIVE MANDATES AND SO WE

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:41.620
RECOMMEND APPROVING THEM

02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:42.721
HOWEVER WE'RE CONCERNED THAT

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:44.556
THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T FACILITATE

02:07:44.623 --> 02:07:46.125
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND

02:07:46.191 --> 02:07:47.793
THAT'S BECAUSE- WHILE THE

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.962
PROPOSAL WHICH PROVIDES DEPOTS

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:51.363
WITH FUNDING TO BETTER MONITOR

02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:53.298
STAFF TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE.

02:07:53.365 --> 02:07:54.666
IT DOESN'T PLAN TO ACT IT

02:07:54.733 --> 02:07:55.801
DOESN'T INCLUDE A PLAN TO KEEP

02:07:55.868 --> 02:07:57.202
THE LEGISLATURE INFORMED OF

02:07:57.269 --> 02:07:58.837
THESE FINDINGS WE THINK THAT

02:07:58.904 --> 02:08:00.339
THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

02:08:00.406 --> 02:08:01.974
IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE HEARD IN

02:08:02.041 --> 02:08:04.376
ISSUE ONE TODAY- TO THE EXTENT

02:08:04.443 --> 02:08:06.178
THAT GAVE RECENT OUT THERE THE

02:08:06.245 --> 02:08:07.479
REPEATED ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:09.348
MISCONDUCT COULD BE TIED TO

02:08:09.415 --> 02:08:11.817
TRAINING DEFICIENCIES- SO WE

02:08:11.884 --> 02:08:13.352
RECOMMEND PASSING TRAILER BILL

02:08:13.419 --> 02:08:14.720
LEGISLATION REQUIRING SUPPOSED

02:08:14.787 --> 02:08:16.088
TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE

02:08:16.155 --> 02:08:18.557
LEGISLATURE BEGINNING JULY ONE

02:08:18.624 --> 02:08:19.091
TWENTY TWENTY TWO ON DATA

02:08:19.158 --> 02:08:20.159
RELEVANT TO TRAINING OUTCOMES

02:08:20.225 --> 02:08:21.960
AND CONCLUSIONS BECAUSE- DRAWS

02:08:22.027 --> 02:08:23.362
FROM THE DATA AND ANY PLANS IT

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:29.868
HAS TO ADDRESS. THE CONCERNS.

02:08:29.935 --> 02:08:30.502
ARE CHALLENGES THAT IDENTIFIES.

02:08:30.569 --> 02:08:31.503
SECOND I WE RECOMMEND. FUND FOR

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:32.938
THE NEW. FACILITY FOR HIM ON.

02:08:33.005 --> 02:08:34.239
FOR CORRECTION OFFICERS GIVEN

02:08:34.306 --> 02:08:36.175
THAT IT APPEARS THAT WORTHWHILE

02:08:36.241 --> 02:08:37.609
TO INSURING CORRECTIONAL

02:08:37.676 --> 02:08:38.277
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:40.079
SUFFICIENTLY. PREPARED TO BEGIN

02:08:40.145 --> 02:08:43.348
WORKING. THIRD WE THINK THAT

02:08:43.415 --> 02:08:45.651
THE IDEA OF THE JOB SHADOWING

02:08:45.717 --> 02:08:46.919
PROGRAM SIMILARLY SEEMS

02:08:46.985 --> 02:08:48.687
WORTHWHILE BUT WE DO HAVE

02:08:48.754 --> 02:08:50.923
CONCERNS WITH THAT TWO OF THE

02:08:50.989 --> 02:08:52.424
RESOURCE AS REQUESTED TO

02:08:52.491 --> 02:08:55.727
SUPPORT IT- SO FIRST THE THIRTY

02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:56.228
THREE SERGEANT POSITIONS

02:08:56.295 --> 02:08:58.931
REQUESTED. BY THE PROGRAM

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:00.032
SEVENTEEN OF THOSE POSITIONS

02:09:00.099 --> 02:09:01.900
ARE DRIVEN BY WORKLOAD THAT'S

02:09:01.967 --> 02:09:03.669
NEW AND ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOB

02:09:03.735 --> 02:09:06.271
SHADOWING PROGRAM. HOWEVER THE

02:09:06.338 --> 02:09:08.073
REMAINING SIXTEEN POSITIONS ARE

02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:10.075
INTENDED TO RELIEVE EXISTING

02:09:10.142 --> 02:09:12.444
STAFF OF CERTAIN TASKS SUCH AS

02:09:12.511 --> 02:09:13.879
MAINTAINING FITNESS EQUIPMENT

02:09:13.946 --> 02:09:15.681
TESTING EQUIPMENT SO THAT THE

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:18.217
OTHER- EXISTING STAFF ARE SO

02:09:18.283 --> 02:09:19.751
THAT THOSE EXISTING BACK

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:20.552
INSTEAD FOCUS ON OTHER

02:09:20.619 --> 02:09:22.488
ACTIVITIES. LIKE SCHEDULING

02:09:22.554 --> 02:09:23.689
STAFF FOR THEIR ANNUAL

02:09:23.755 --> 02:09:24.723
TRAININGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:26.792
REPORTS ARE NOT GETTING DONE IN

02:09:26.859 --> 02:09:28.327
A TIMELY MANNER BUT THE

02:09:28.393 --> 02:09:29.528
DEPARTMENT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO

02:09:29.595 --> 02:09:31.163
PROVIDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION ON

02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:32.865
THE EXTENT THAT THOSE TASKS

02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:35.734
AREN'T. EVEN BEING- COMPLETED

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:39.738
IN A TIMELY MANNER- IN OTHER

02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:41.974
WORDS- THE DEPARTMENT HAD AT

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:44.810
PROVIDED DETAILED ANALYSIS ON-

02:09:44.877 --> 02:09:46.545
CURRENT WORKLOAD AND THE NUMBER

02:09:46.612 --> 02:09:48.547
OF POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:49.081
REQUIRED TO COMPLETE IN A

02:09:49.148 --> 02:09:51.483
TIMELY MANNER. SO WE RECOMMEND

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:53.218
AT REJECTING SIXTEEN POSITIONS

02:09:53.285 --> 02:09:54.319
THAT AREN'T TIED DIRECTLY TO

02:09:54.386 --> 02:09:56.088
THE NEW JOB TRAINING PROGRAM

02:09:56.155 --> 02:09:57.156
WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE FUNDING

02:09:57.222 --> 02:09:58.223
NEEDED BY TWO POINT SEVEN

02:09:58.290 --> 02:09:59.958
MILLION ANNUALLY. AND THE

02:10:00.025 --> 02:10:02.027
SECOND RESOURCE THAT- WE HAVE

02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:03.495
CONCERNED WITH THAT'S REQUESTED

02:10:03.562 --> 02:10:04.062
FOR THE NEW JOB SHATTERING

02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:06.165
PROGRAM IS THATYOU SIX POINT

02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:07.599
TWO MILLION TO PAY NEW OFFICERS

02:10:07.666 --> 02:10:08.934
WHILE THEY'RE DOING THE JOB

02:10:09.001 --> 02:10:10.702
SHADOWING- AND THE REASON WE

02:10:10.769 --> 02:10:11.737
ARE CONCERNED WITH THAT IT'S

02:10:11.803 --> 02:10:13.472
SIMPLY THAT THE FUNDING AMOUNT

02:10:13.539 --> 02:10:15.841
AS SOON. ONE THOUSAND EIGHT

02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:16.608
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NEW OFFICERS

02:10:16.675 --> 02:10:18.777
PER YEAR BUT CDC ARE A SINCE

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:21.446
REVISED THAT ESTIMATE TWO ONE

02:10:21.513 --> 02:10:22.414
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY

02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:23.048
SIX NEW OFFICERS IN THE BUDGET

02:10:23.115 --> 02:10:25.150
YEAR. SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:26.051
REDUCING THE FUNDING

02:10:26.118 --> 02:10:30.522
ACCORDINGLY- WHICH WOULD BE BY

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:32.090
ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. AND

02:10:32.157 --> 02:10:33.759
FOR- OVER ARCHING COMMENT IS

02:10:33.825 --> 02:10:35.761
THAT PRISON CLOSURES WILL

02:10:35.827 --> 02:10:37.329
REDUCE FUTURE NEED FOR

02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:38.797
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. AND

02:10:38.864 --> 02:10:40.599
THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN PRISONS ARE

02:10:40.666 --> 02:10:42.234
CLOSE OFFICERS AT THOSE

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:44.136
PRESENTS CAN. HAVE THE

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:45.671
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE ELSEWHERE

02:10:45.737 --> 02:10:47.239
IN THE STATE TO FILL VACANCIES

02:10:47.306 --> 02:10:48.874
AT THE REMAINING PRESENTS.

02:10:48.941 --> 02:10:50.242
REDUCING THE NEED FOR NEW

02:10:50.309 --> 02:10:53.245
OFFICERS- TO BE PRODUCED. BY

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:57.149
THE ACADEMY. SO WHILE

02:10:57.216 --> 02:10:59.218
HISTORICALLY THAT THE NEED FOR

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:00.219
DOCTORS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:02.588
CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR-

02:11:02.654 --> 02:11:04.790
MEANING AND AS A RESULT CDCR

02:11:04.856 --> 02:11:07.826
BUDGET. ISN'T ADJUSTED ANNUALLY

02:11:07.893 --> 02:11:08.927
TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN THE

02:11:08.994 --> 02:11:10.929
NUMBER OF OFFICERS NEW OFFICERS

02:11:10.996 --> 02:11:13.865
AT NEEDS TO PRODUCE- HOWEVER.

02:11:13.932 --> 02:11:16.368
GIVEN PRISON CLOSURES ON THE

02:11:16.435 --> 02:11:19.271
HORIZON- CTC ARTS. BASED BUDGET

02:11:19.338 --> 02:11:21.073
FOR THE PROPER TRAINING AS WELL

02:11:21.139 --> 02:11:22.241
AS THE PERFECT PROPOSALS BEFORE

02:11:22.307 --> 02:11:24.676
YOU TODAY- ADVOCATES OFFICER

02:11:24.743 --> 02:11:27.946
TRAINING- PROGRAM. COULD BECOME

02:11:28.013 --> 02:11:29.448
EXCESSIVE SO WE RECOMMEND

02:11:29.514 --> 02:11:30.549
PASSING BUDGET TRAILER

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:31.617
LEGISLATION REQUIRING THE

02:11:31.683 --> 02:11:33.385
ADMINISTRATION TO PROPOSE.

02:11:33.452 --> 02:11:35.087
ADJUSTMENTS THE CITY'S AIRSPACE

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.855
BUDGET FOR TRAINING NEW

02:11:36.922 --> 02:11:37.422
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ON AN

02:11:37.489 --> 02:11:39.491
ANNUAL BASIS- THIS WOULD BE

02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:40.759
SIMILAR TO HOW OTHER AREAS OF

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:41.693
CITIES YEAR'S BUDGET ARE

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:43.862
CURRENTLY. ADJUSTED ANNUALLY.

02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:49.935
BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS LIKE.

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:50.469
THE NUMBER OF INMATES ARE

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:53.472
PAROLEES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:11:53.538 --> 02:11:54.973

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:04.182
NECESSARY. TO PUT IT INTO

USEFUL REPORTING METRICS WE

02:12:13.425 --> 02:12:14.726
WOULD WANT TO EVALUATE WHAT

02:12:14.793 --> 02:12:16.328
REPORTING THAT DEPARTMENT

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:17.829
CURRENTLY DOES AS WELL AS ANY

02:12:17.896 --> 02:12:19.665
POTENTIAL FISCAL IMPACTS OF

02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:21.867
PROPOSED REPORTING ALTERNATELY

02:12:21.933 --> 02:12:23.735
CCAR'S COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESS

SERGEANTS FOR THE JOB

SHATTERING. IT WE BELIEVE IT'S

02:12:32.177 --> 02:12:33.679
CRITICAL TO HAVE A SERGEANT AT

02:12:33.745 --> 02:12:35.314
EACH INSTITUTION DEDICATED TO

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:36.448
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:38.350
PROGRAM INSTITUTIONS HAVE

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:39.818
DIFFERENT MISSIONS DIFFERENTLY

OTHER UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES AND

02:12:44.022 --> 02:12:44.890
IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT THE

02:12:44.956 --> 02:12:46.258
STAFF WHO OVERSEE THE JOB

02:12:46.325 --> 02:12:47.859
SHADOWING PROGRAM ARE WELL

02:12:47.926 --> 02:12:49.428
VERSED IN THE SPECIFICS OF

02:12:49.494 --> 02:12:52.497
THEIR INSTITUTION. THAT WAY THE

CRIMINAL OFFICERS CAN RECEIVE

02:12:54.499 --> 02:12:56.501
SITE SPECIFIC TRAINING

ACADEMY OUT WE DON'T BELIEVE IT

02:13:31.303 --> 02:13:32.471
WE BELIEVE IT'S PREMATURE TO

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:33.939
CONSIDER THIS TYPE OF AN

02:13:34.005 --> 02:13:35.440
ADJUSTMENT THERE'S STILL

02:13:35.507 --> 02:13:36.608
NUMEROUS UNKNOWNS IN THE

02:13:36.675 --> 02:13:38.043
FORESEEABLE FUTURE WHICH MAKE

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:39.144
IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:41.546
OFFICER NEEDED LONG TERM FUTURE

02:13:41.613 --> 02:13:43.081
ATTRITION RATE IS BASED ON A

02:13:43.148 --> 02:13:44.449
NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE

02:13:44.516 --> 02:13:46.385
EFFECTS OF COCAINE SALARY AND

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:48.120
BENEFIT COMPENSATION AND THE

02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:49.755
EFFECTS OF PRESIDENT BUSH OR

EVEN IF THERE IS REDUCING IT

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:53.191
TEMPORARILY. THERE WILL BE

02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:54.659
CONTINUED RETIREMENTS WHICH

02:13:54.726 --> 02:13:56.361
WOULD NECESSITATE OFFICERS ARE

02:13:56.428 --> 02:13:59.064
WILLING WE BELIEVE IT ARE STILL

02:13:59.131 --> 02:14:01.400
PREMATURE TO IT SURE DOES THAT
