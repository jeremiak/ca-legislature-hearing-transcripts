ONE I WANT TO WELCOME MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION ALSO KNOWN AS C. C. L.. PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR PROBABLY REACTING DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO PRESENT ON OUR COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING OR CCL AS YOU MENTIONED. TODAY -- THIS IS OUR SECOND LARGEST DIVISION -- IN THE DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING NEARLY SEVENTY THOUSAND FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERYTHING FROM INFANT CARE UP TO ADULT WAS SENIOR CARE AND HOT WITH INCLUDING HOSPICE AT THE END -- AND SO WITH ME TODAY IS PAM TO CROSS WHO IS THE DEPUTY OF OUR COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION -- WHO'S GOING TO DO THE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS FOR YOU YOUR AGENDA DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF LAYING OUT THE BACKGROUND IN THE HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT SO WE THOUGHT. WITH YOUR A PERMISSION WE WILL GO STRAIGHT TO THE QUESTION. THANK YOU SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS. PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE INSPECTION FREQUENCY AND THE CONFIDENCE LEVEL TO OBTAIN AND REACH ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AS PRESCRIBED IN CURRENT LAW. SO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE RECEIVED FUNDING TO DO AT INCREASE OUR INSPECTIONS FOR ALL THREE PROGRAMS CHILD CARE CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL ADULT SENIOR CARE FROM FIVE YEARS TO THREE YEARS. SO WE BACK BEGAN THAT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEVEN AND THEN IN TWENTY EIGHT TEAM WE WENT TO TWO YEARS FOR CHILDCARE AND CHILDRENS RESIDENTIAL AND STATE AT THREE YEARS FOR CHILD CARE WHEN WE MET THOSE MANDATES ABOUT NINETEEN WERE AT UP -- TO ANNUAL INSPECTIONS FOR ADULTS SENIOR CARE AND THEN TWO YEARS FOR CHILDCARE AND CHILDRENS RESIDENTIAL SO. AND THERE'S AS ALL SPEAK TO AT THE END THERE'S MANY IN THE BUDGET TO DO ANNUAL INSPECTIONS FOR CHILD CARE SO. THAT IS GREAT NEWS TO WRITE WE DO SEE THAT THE CHILD CARE CENTERS ARE ON TRACK TO BE VISITED ANNUALLY WITH THE THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER THAT WE RECEIVED AND I KNOW THAT. WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS -- MAY EIGHTH. AT THE SIDE ON MAY EIGHTH HEARING SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT THAT IS GREAT NEWS YEAH IT'S CURRENTLY IN STATURE THAT THREE YEARS BUT CORRECT. KAY AND THAT'S WHAT WE INTENDED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THE THREE YEARS BUT I THINK WE'RE ON TRACK FOR THE ONE YEAR. WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN WE CAN DO IT. SEC ANY QUESTIONS NO NO PLEASE CONTINUE OKAY I JUST WANTED LIKE THAT THIS IS EXCITING NEWS I WANTED TO BE SURE WE WENT OVER ON THE SAME PAGE ON THAT YES THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS IMPOSSIBLE IMPEDIMENTS TO THE NEW INSPECTION TOOLS SO THE NEW INSPECTION TOOLS -- THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFITS TO IT WHO -- WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS WE JUST COMPLETED OUR FIRST PILOT WITH WITH SENIOR KERR. WE HAVE A WE DID OVER THREE HUNDRED FACILITIES AND THE PILOT WITH TWENTY L. P. A.'S SO WE RECEIVED A LOT OF INFORMATION AND DATA FROM THAT TO WHERE WE'RE UPDATING THE TOOLS TO PROVIDE MORE MORE EFFICIENCIES MAKE THEM SHORTER. SO THE TOOL IS DEVELOPED AROUND THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE -- DIFFERENT FROM HOW THE KIT WAS STILL IN THE IN THE INSPECTION WE GET MORE OF A OF A WELL BALANCED -- LOOK AT HELP THE HELP THE FACILITY IT GOES AROUND IT'S BUILT ON DOMAINS LIKE PHYSICAL PLANT MEDICATIONS EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS -- RESIDENT RIGHTS AND SO IT'S FOCUSED ON ALL OF THOSE AREAS AND IT'S ALSO GOT THE ABILITY FOR CONTINUALLY UPDATED THAT WHEN THERE'S NEW LEGISLATION WE UPDATE IT SO IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE TOOL WE DON'T HAVE A STANDARD COM -- COMPREHENSIVE TOOL FOR OUR PROGRAM SO IT'S ALL THE TRAINING IN THEIR HEADS THAT THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT TO GO AROUND AND AND CHECK MOST OF THAT NOW WE HAVE A STANDARD. ANOTHER BENEFIT IS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A BASELINE OF DATA WE USE OUR DATA TO SEE WHERE WE IDENTIFY CHALLENGES IN IN CHILDCARE OR ADULT SENIOR KERR -- WE'VE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TRAINING IN THOSE AREAS WHERE WE'RE SEEING THEY'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD SYMPOSIUMS TO TRAIN. EVEN THE STAFF IN THE FACILITIES AS WELL AS OUR OWN STAFF LIKE FOR INSTANCE PRESSURE ULCERS THEY'VE HAD. YOU KNOW AT A LARGE INCREASE IN PRESSURE ULCERS IN OUR ADULT SENIOR CARE FACILITIES IN THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT CLINICIANS SO WE'RE TRAINING THEM ON HOW. TO PREVENT THEM AND HOW TO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY CHANGE MEDICATIONS WITH AN ADULT HOW THEY INTERACT TOGETHER THEY MIGHT LOOK FOR THINGS LIKE SLEEPING MORE. MOVING THEM AROUND GIVING THEM ACTIVE SO I MEAN THERE'S THINGS THAT WE TRAIN OUR LPH TO TRAIN THEM FOR BEST PRACTICES CHILD CARE WE DID -- CHALLENGING BEING CHILDREN WITH CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT WE TRAINED YOU KNOW BOTH THE CARE GIVERS AS WELL AS OUR OWN STAFF. AND THAT'S ALL. PART OF THIS NEW TOOL IS TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION WHEN THEY GO OUT AND DO AN INSPECTION TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHILE THEY'RE OUT AT THE FACILITY INSTEAD OF DECIDING THEM AND AND AND WHAT WE WERE DOING IN THE PAST. USING ARMED FORCE MEANT. AND THEN WE WERE JUST SHUTTING THEM DOWN SO WE WERE SEEING IT WASN'T DOING ANY GOOD WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF BEDS IN THE STATE AND SO THAT THAT IS THAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR THE NEW TOOLS WE WERE SEEN WE WERE IN THERE DOING pLATER THEY'RE HAVING PROBLEMS THAT WERE NOT IDENTIFIED WHEN WE WERE IN THERE PRIOR WITH THE KIT -- AND THEN SOME OF THE IMPEDIMENTS IT'S CERTAINLY THE TOOL TOOK LONGER IN THE PILOT BUT IT'S A IT'S A COMPREHENSIVE TOOL AS OPPOSED TO THE KIT WHICH IS AS A SHORT ABBREVIATED TOOL. SO FROM THAT COMPREHENSIVE TOOL WE'RE GOING TO DEVELOP THE STANDARD TOLL WHICH WILL BE A MUCH SHORTER ONE SO THE TOLL IT TOOK A LONG TIME SO THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS. BUT WE'VE ALREADY. WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THAT THEY AND LICENSED LICENSEES AS WELL AS THE L. P. A.'S. AND GOT SOME OF THEIR FEEDBACK FROM THE TOOL SO WE'VE ALREADY REDUCE THE REGULATIONS ON THAT TOLL FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED BASED ON THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF ALL OF OF THE REGULATIONS WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT. THAT FINDING TO OCCUR LOOKING AT PASSED STATUS SO WE'VE ALREADY REDUCED IT DOWN SO WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH SHORTER -- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE IMPEDIMENT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION YOU KNOW THERE'S LIMóN LIMITATIONS. WITH OUR LEGACY SYSTEMS WERE LOOKING TOWARDS GETTING ON A NEW -- I. T. SYSTEM BUT OUR OUR SYSTEMS ARE VERY SLOW -- SO BUILDING THAT INTO THAT SYSTEM THAT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT OF A LIMITATION BUT WE'RE STILL YOU KNOW GOING TO GO FORWARD WITH THAT -- WORKING AROUND THOSE CHALLENGES. SO THE NEXT QUESTION WHAT ARE THE AREAS OF CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMPLAINT PROCESSES. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE COMPLAINTS WE'VE HAD A BACKLOG YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND WE RECEIVE THIRTEEN POSITIONS. AND TWENTY FIFTEEN LIMITED TERM POSITIONS AND WERE ASKING FOR AN EXTENSION OF FUNDING FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS FOR THOSE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WE DIVIDED THOSE THAT BETWEEN ADULTS SENIOR CARE AND AND CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL BECAUSE ACTUALLY THOSE. THE RESIDENTIAL INSPECTIONS TAKE MUCH LONGER THAN THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES -- AND SO WE DIVIDED THEM UP TO CONTINUE AT WE HAVE REDUCE THE BACKLOG CONTINUALLY OVER THE YEARS. HOWEVER THE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING -- OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS SO WE'VE BEEN KEEPING UP WITH THE INCREASE COMPLAINTS AND JUST WHITTLING AWAY AT THE BACKLOG. AND AS WELL AS KEEPING UP WITH OUR INSPECTIONS. WE'VE ALSO DIVIDE -- DEVELOP THE STATE WIDE TRIAGE PROCESS SO WHEN THE COMPLAINTS COME IN WE HAVE PEACE OFFICER INVESTIGATORS THAT WORK FOR US A SMALL CADRE OF PEACE OFFICERS SO THEY DO OUR PRIORITY ONES WITH CHURCH SEXUAL ABUSE -- IT FOR ONE EXAMPLE AND SO WE'VE DEVELOPED A TRIAGE PROCESS SO IT'S EASY AND QUICK AND IT'S A STANDARD ACROSS THE STATE THAT. THE COMPLAINT -- TRIAGE AND THEN THEY'RE SENT EITHER TO THE THE PEACE OFFICERS OR THEIR SENT TOWARD L. P. A.'S. THE MOST OF THEM GO OUT OF OUR LPA IS THAT ARE THE THE NORMAL ANALYSTS THAT DO THE INSPECTIONS BUT IT'S MUCH FASTER IT'S MORE EFFICIENT -- THE INVESTIGATORS THE PEACE OFFICERS ARE TAKING ON MORE WORK SO THAT THAT'S ONE WAY THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED -- SOME OF THE BACKLOG SO AND WE JUST CONTINUE TO JUST LOOK FOR EFFICIENCIES AS FAR AS WE STILL WANT TO DO THOROUGH INSPECTIONS WE DON'T WANT TO RUSH THROUGH THESE INSPECTIONS SO OF THE PRIMARY THE BACKLOG OR PRIORITY THREE AND FORCE. WHICH ARE -- THEY COULD BE COLD FOOD OR IT COULD BE -- PAPER ISSUES THEY'RE NOT HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES. AND SO THE LAST QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE FEEDBACK FROM DISTRICT STAFF ON THE CHANGES ACROSS THE CO. SO THAT HAS BEEN -- IT'S A IT'S A LONG CULTURE TO CHANGE THAT THAT GOING FROM STRICTLY ENFORCEMENT TO FOCUSING ON PREVENTION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO KEEP THESE FACILITIES AND COMPLIANCE -- AND SO THEY VIEW THAT AS A POSITIVE THEY THEY LIKE HAD TAKEN THE TIME TO DO THAT AND MAKING SURE THAT THE LICENSEE UNDERSTANDS THE REGULATION THEY VIOLATED BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND. IS WHEN WE WERE CITING THEM THEY REALLY DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE THE RED REGULATION SO PART OF THE TOOL IS. THEY NEED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM SHOW THEM THE REGULATION AND EXPLAIN TO THEM AT THAT TIME. WHERE THE VIOLATION OCCURRED SO IT'S MORE OF A ADD A ADD TRAINING AT THAT TIME AS WELL? SO THAT. PART OF THAT WAS THE POSITIVE FROM THE STUFF -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES IN HOW WE WRITE UP OUR REPORTS WITH PRINCIPLES OF DOCUMENTATION THEY USED TO WRITE FREE HAND AND SO THERE WAS NO. STANDARDIZATION THE THE REPORTS ARE UP ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE LIKE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HITS ON OUR WEBSITE A MONTH SO. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME STANDARDIZATION SO THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE VIOLATION WAS AND AND HAVE A SPECIFIC FORMAT SO -- WE'VE EMBEDDED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESSES THROUGHOUT. IS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CANCEL ON WE IMPLEMENT THESE NEW CHANGES THAT WE REALLY LOOK TO SEE IF THEY'RE THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE NEW GUIDELINES ON AND FOR THE MOST PART THERE ARE THERE ARE -- THEIR SUPPORT OF OF THE OF THE NEW PROCESS AS THEY SEE IT WAS NEEDED IT WAS NEEDED IN THE INDUSTRY -- AND IN IT WE JUST INCREASED OUR TRAINING TEN FOLD -- ALL YEAR LONG WE'RE CONTINUALLY FINDING NEW THINGS AND TRAINING GIVEN THE BEST PRACTICES TO HELP THE LICENSEES -- AND THEN LASTLY WE HAVE -- YOU'LL SEE A PROPOSAL COMING UP ON THE CHILD CARE POSITIONS THE MONEY WAS BUILT INTO THE BUDGET LAST YEAR AND SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A OF A PROPOSAL COMING FORWARD TO ASK FOR THE POSITIONS -- TO DO THE INSPECTIONS. WELL WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING IN TERMS OF ENCOURAGING THEM TO EVERY EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR CHILD CARE. YES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ONLY ONE THING I WANNA ADD IS I HAVE TO HAND OUTS FOR YOU FOR LATER THAT I HAD PASSED OUT ONE IS ARMS INSPECTION PROCESS PROJECT THAT. IT'S THAT IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE AND THEN OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN YEAR IN REVIEW THAT KIND OF GIVES YOU A SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF THE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE PAST YEAR THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE [inaudible] HELLO. BUT WE WE KNOW THAT USUALLY CCL IS USUALLY PART OF THE FOSTER CARE ISSUE -- IN THE SUB THREE HEARINGS BUT WE DECIDED TO NEEDS TO BE PUT AT THE FRONT -- BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE THE CHILDREN. AND OUR SENIORS ARE ADULTS. AND WE APPRECIATE THE INPUT AND YOU'VE PROVIDED. I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT GOING ANNUALLY WITHI THINK THAT WITH THE TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION -- THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT INTO THE BUDGET TO WORK OUT I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT. NOW HAVING THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS A WONDERFUL. LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS POINT. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME'S TONY TICKET TELLEM A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. A LOT OF OUR WORK IS IN SENIOR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES. NEARLY TO PRAISE THE WORK OF COMMUNICATE LICENSING -- THEY'VE DONE A FABULOUS JOB IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN KERR WAS GETTING PRETTY BAD. THE LEGISLATURE RESPONDED THE PAST TEN DIFFERENT OF BILLS TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE GOING ON IN AND SEE SEE A REALLY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE NAY BEEN. BUSY EVER SINCE A LOT OF REGULATORY PACKAGES TO IMPLEMENT THOSE LAWS. COMPLAINTS ARE ARE REALLY GOING THROUGH THE ROOF UNFORTUNATELY -- AND THE INCREASED NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS WHICH IS GREAT -- THEY'VE DONE A FABULOUS JOB WITH ALL THIS IT'S A IT'S A GREAT TEAM. THE LEAP FROM THE LEADERSHIP ON DOWN THEY'RE VERY DEDICATED SUPER COLLABORATIVE -- YOU CAN TELL THEIR HEART IS IN THE WORK AND IT REALLY SHOWS.

I CERTAINLY. IS THAT BETTER OKAY GREAT I'M BEFORE WE GET INTO THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM I WANTED TO JUST BRIEFLY MENTIONED THE DEPARTMENTS -- PRIMARILY FUNDED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE RECEIVE ON A ANNUAL BASIS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THOSE DOLLARS ARE FOR OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND OUR WEATHER'S ATION. ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN ADDITION WE RECEIVE WE HAVE RECEIVED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWO MILLION IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS. FOR OUR LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. THE PRIMARY MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT IS TO REDUCE POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA AND ALL OF THE PROGRAMS PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORT. TO THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY AND STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. WE ALLOCATE THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT FUNDING TO A SIXTY A LOCAL AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION ALONE CAN CALIFORNIANS BENEFIT EVERY YEAR FOR FOR OUR THIS PROGRAM. THROUGH THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT FUNDS ENERGY ASSISTANCE THAT HELP CALIFORNIANS PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS PREVENT DISCONNECTIONS AND IMPROVE THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AND HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR HOMES OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS -- RECEIVE PROGRAM OF SERVICES EVERY YEAR. WELL THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET RECOMMENDS ELIMINATING ALL OF ARE FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS CONGRESS HAS HISTORICALLY SUPPORTED FUNDING. THESE PROGRAMS AND FUNDING LEVELS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY STEADY -- THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND EVEN SOMETIMES INCREASING. AS THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTI POVERTY TOOLS AVAILABLE THE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CLAIM THAT THE FEDERAL AND STATE CREDITS. A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT HAS LED A REDUCING POVERTY WORK GROUP. MADE UP OF PUBLIC AGENCIES AND PRIVATE NON PROFITS COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING STRATEGIES AND COORDINATING THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME. TAX CREDIT EDUCATION AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. AS PART OF THIS EFFORT CST HAS PARTNERED WITH FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. TO ADMINISTER CAL EITC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. GRANTS. AS WELL AS THE NEW TAX ASSISTANCE PREPARATION GRANTS.

THIS YEAR THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE OF 42% AND THE NUMBER OF CALLIE IT SCRIPT CREDITS ISSUED -- AS OF APRIL THIRTEENTH AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND CAL E. I. T. C. HAS BEEN CLAIMED WHICH IS A 13% INCREASE. NOW ON TO THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES. SOLAR VOTER PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY. YOUR REDUCES ENERGY EXPENSES FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FREEING UP LIMITED DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS THIS IS THE ONLY PROGRAM OF ITS KIND IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDING LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITH SOLAR PEAVEY.

RECEIVED ROOFTOP SOLAR PEAVEY SYSTEMS THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES RECEIVING THESE SERVICES ARE MADE UP OF FIVE REGIONS IN THE STATE. AND FOR THE FIVE REGIONS FUNDING HAS BEEN COMPLETELY EXPENDED THE FIFTH REGION WILL BE FULLY EXPENDED THIS MONTH -- I BELIEVE YOU RECEIVED AN UPDATED FROM WHAT WAS IN THE AGENDA SO CURRENTLY -- IN OUR REGION FOR THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS REMAINING AND THAT WILL BE COMPLETELY EXPENDED THIS MONTH. CONTINUATION OF STATEWIDE SINGLE FAMILY AND SOLAR PEAVEY SERVICES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON FUTURE FUNDING. THE SECOND COME A COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND INCENTIVES FOR THE INSTALLATION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES AND SOLAR PEAVEY. IN LOW INCOME MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS TO BENEFIT LOW INCOME TENANTS WHILE ALSO HELPING TO PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A TOTAL OF FIFTY FOUR MILLION HUSBAND ALLOCATE.

BY JUNE THE ENROLLMENT OF ADDITIONAL A MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS WILL BE CONTINGENT UPON FUTURE FUNDING. THE TWO NEW COMPONENTS OF THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM ARE THE COMMUNITY SOLAR PILOT AND THE FARM WORKER HOUSING THE COMMUNITY SOLAR PILOT IS DESIGNED TO EXPAND ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. INCLUDING THOSE THAT DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARK DISSIPATE IN EXISTING LOW INCOME SOLAR PEAVEY PROGRAMS. EITHER DUE TO A LACK OF HOME OWNERSHIP OR INADEQUATE ROOFING OR OTHER FACTORS. FOR THE PILOT GREAT ALTERNATIVES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SANTA ROSA BAND OF COOLEY INDIANS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAS BEEN AWARDED A LITTLE OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

THANK YOU AND I'M SURE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE A LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PALACE BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. TO THE REST OF THE SHIRT WAS TO THE REST OF THE PRESENTATIONS AND UNLESS THERE IS A QUESTION. THAT IS VERY PRESSING OKAY. MADAM CHAIR -- AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS MEDICALLY SARAH AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LOCAL BUT IF YOUR CAMPESINA. ECHO BUT IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY ATION. OF NATIONAL FARM WORKER PROGRAM'S DESIGNATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EIGHTY TWO ACCESS POINTS LOCATED IN ALL OF THE THIRTY FOUR CALIFORNIA'S MOST SIGNIFICANT AGRICULTURAL COUNTIES. WE SERVE OR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR AND OVER FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THESE ARE FARMWORKERS. WE HAVE BEEN AT ACTIVELY SEEKING CAP AND TRADE FUNDS THE SERVER THE FARM WORKER COMMUNITIES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. OUR STATE HAS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED FALL SOME FARMWORKERS. AND 18% OF DEALT WITH OWN HOME. IN SPITE OUR USUAL FOR RECALL SCHOOLS TO HAVE EXTENDED FAMILY LIVING WITH HIM. SO THE CONSUMPTION PER UNIT APOSTLE IS MUCH GREATER. EVERY YEAR WE HAVE SOUGHT OF FUNDING TO OFFER EXTENSIVE WHETHER INFLATION. APPLIANCE REPLACEMENT AND SOLAR PANEL INSTALLATION FOR DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN X. MENTIONED BEFORE LOCAL BUT IF YOU I RECEIVED FUNDING FROM CAP AND TRADE THROUGH THE LANGUAGE PROGRAM -- ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUTER SERVICES IN DEVELOPMENT WE SERVE THE REGION FIVE WHICH INCLUDED FIVE COUNTIES. SOME OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FARM WORKER POPULATIONS. IN CONNIE FLIGHT RIVERSIDE AND IMPERIAL ENERGY IS A HUGE EXPENSE DUE TO EXTREMELY HOT WEATHER. WE WERE ABLE TO SERVE OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED HOMES AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX OF THESE WERE. INSTALLED SOLAR PANELS. THE POPULATION WE SERVE HALF AN INCOME THAT RANGES FROM TEN TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. OUR GOAL IS TWO FOLD. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS OBVIOUSLY TO REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. BUT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ALSO IS RAISING THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOME THIS IS HUGE FOR OUR PEOPLE -- AND THAT'S WHERE WE MY HARD IS IT IS THAT WITH THIS PROGRAM -- IN FACT WHEN WE READ TO YOU. BOUGHT FOR THIS MORNING FOR THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. QUOTE THE PROGRAM HAS HELPED MY FAMILY AND HOME AMANDA SO. THE COST OF MY ELECTRIC BILL IN THE SUMMERS USED TO BE ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED A MONTH. BY NOW IRON PAYING LESS THAN TWENTY DOLLARS SOME I'VE. THAT'S GREAT WHEN I WAS A KID WE USED TO PAY A MERCHANT CALEXICO PART PERFECT FOUNDER DOLLARS MONTH. SECOND QUOTE. IT IS LOWER MY GOOD ACTORS TO THE BILL MY FIRST BILL WAS TWO DOLLARS AND FORTY FOUR CENTS. IN UPCOMING BAIL IS FOUR DOLLARS AND FORTY FOUR CENTS. I WISH I WOULD HAVE SIGNED UP SOONER. ANOTHER ONE MY ELECTRIC BILL USED TO BE SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY DOLLARS A MONTH. AROUND JANUARY BUT THIS MONTH ONLY PAID FIVE DOLLARS. AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT THE PROGRAMS ON THE BOTTOM BUT IT SHOULD BE ALL ABOUT. BESIDES REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY SERVICES DEVELOPMENT RECENTLY AWARDED LOOK OVER AT THE WHITE WAS SMASHED BY THE DIRECTOR. OF A GRANT. TO SERVE TWELVE CONTESTS IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT IS OUR HOPE THE FUTURE CAPTAIN FREE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED FOR FARMWORKERS AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THE CURRICULA IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE AND I MYSELF WILL ADVOCATE FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND THE EXPANSION TO FOR FARMWORKERS AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S IN THE FACTORY IN ALL. WE SPENDING BILLIONS TO REDUCE. THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE MUST NOT FORGET. OUR POOR PEOPLE THE WORKING POOR. THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO BE GREEN UNLESS WE INTERVENE AND HELP THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLACE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANNA AND YOUR BROOKS I'M THE WEST COAST DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR ENERGY AFFORDABILITY. AND WE'RE A NONPROFIT TECHNICAL SERVICES AND TRAINING ORGANIZATION THAT'S DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN BUILDINGS IN ORDER TO FOSTER AND MAINTAIN AFFORDABLE AND HEALTHY HOUSING AND COMMUNITIES. WE'RE CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED FOR THE STATEWIDE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM FOR MULTI FAMILY AND IN THAT ROLE WE PROVIDE ALL OF THE TECHNICAL AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED BY PROPERTY OWNERS. IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT DEEP ENERGY RETROFIT PROJECTS -- WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING LOW INCOME MULTI FAMILY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE. ENERGY PROGRAMS UP FOR A VARIETY OF STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES UTILITIES SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND I CAN DEFINITIVELY SAY. THAT THIS PROGRAM IS THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND IMPACTFUL -- THE WE'VE EVER BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH. RESIDENTS OF MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT POPULATION TO SERVE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. INCLUDING THE INHERENT SPLIT INCENTIVE THAT EXIST BETWEEN PROPERTY OWNERS TO PAY FOR AND PURCHASE THE ENERGY CONSUMING EQUIPMENT IN THE BUILDING AND THE TENANTS ARE TYPICALLY PAY FOR THE UTILITY BILLS -- OTHER CHALLENGES INCLUDE THE JUST THE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES TRYING TO GET INTO EVERY. UNIT OF A MULTI FAMILY BUILDING IN ONE PASS IN ONE OF A KIND OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECT -- THE COORDINATION OF THE VARIOUS TRADES AND CONTRACTORS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM THESE COMPREHENSIVE RETROFITS AND JUST THE LIMITED BUDGETS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS -- MANY OF THESE PROPERTIES OPERATE ON VERY VERY THIN -- MARGINS AND AND AND WITH VERY RESTRICTED OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCESS THAT -- SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE CHALLENGES AND THE LIVE AT MULTI FAMILY PROGRAM HAS ADDRESSED MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES IN VERY UNPRECEDENTED WAYS. IT'S THE FIRST MULTI FAMILY PROGRAM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO BREAK DOWN THE KIND OF ARTIFICIAL SILOS THAT IF THE THAT EXIST BETWEEN ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SOLAR AND IS ABLE TO DELIVER BOTH OF THOSE RESOURCES TO THESE PROJECTS -- IN A SINGLE KIND OF DELIVERY MODEL AND A SINGLE -- FOR TO REFUND SINGLE FUNDING SOURCE. IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST MULTI FAMILY PROGRAM IN THE STATE TO DEVELOP A MEANS OF OF REALLY INCENTIVIZING AND AND DRIVING BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION AND D. CARBONIZATION PROJECTS. IT'S THE ONLY MULTI FAMILY PER LOW INCOME PROGRAM THAT'S ABLE TO SERVE BOTH DEED RESTRICTED REGULATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL AS NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- UNREGULATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AND IT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING A FARM WORKER HOUSING ELDERLY POPULATIONS AND FORMALLY HOMELESS. FACILITIES THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR FORMALLY HOMELESS. SO THERE. THERE ARE FEW USERS THE FEW OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE LANDMARK PROGRAM UNFORTUNATELY. DESPITE ITS SUCCESS AND THE OVERWHELMING DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM. IT'S STILL REMAINS FAIRLY UNDER FUNDED AND VERY UNPREDICTABLY FUNDED -- AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE A WAITING LIST THAT REPRESENTS OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN OVER A THOUSAND BUILDINGS CURRENTLY. THIS IS IT THE THE MULTI FAMILY PROGRAM IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF PROGRAM BUT THE ONES THAT DELIVER MULTIPLE BENEFITS TO THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS. POVERTY HEALTH HOUSING COSTS RESILIENCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION THAT REQUIRE LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE AND PREDICTABLE FUNDING. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LOUISE SPONSORS AND I'M THE CEO OF COMMUNITY RESOURCE PROJECT A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED IN SACRAMENTO -- AND FOR FORTY SIX YEARS WE PROVIDED MUCH NEEDED A POVERTY INTERVENTION SERVICES TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

WE UNDERSTAND THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THE TYPE OF HOUSING THAT WE ENCOUNTER WHEN. WHEN WE'RE TRYING -- TO INSTALL THESE DIFFERENT.

ONE IS CARE -- WHICH IS A DIRECT RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TARGETING INCOME QUALIFY THE OTHER IS HE SAID. WHICH IS ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF LIGHT WHERE BECAUSE IT IS A VERY UNIQUE PROGRAM IT COMPLEMENTS WHAT WE DO WITH EASE A VERY WELL. BUT IT GOES INTO AREAS OF SERVICE THE OESA IS VERY LIMITED. IN OTHER WORDS IT IT STANDS GREATER LEVELS OF WEATHERIZATION IT ALSO PROVIDES A SOLAR COMPONENT WHICH THE UTILITY PROGRAMS DO NOT. SO I THINK THAT REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS IS THAT THE CPU SEE WE REALLY USE Y. WEAPON THAT DISCUSSION OF LIGHT WEAPON THE WE NEED TO GROW THIS PROGRAM WITHOUT A DOUBT. IS REALLY A FOUR RUNNER FOR WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH LOW INCOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE. SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF NOT ONLY LIVE WEB BUT CST. IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CONTINUED PERFORMANCE IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOGIN WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. AND I WOULD HUMBLY REQUEST THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM A CONNECTION WITH NOT ONLY THE EXISTING BUDGET BUT ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ ADDIS ON BEHALF OF CENTRAL COAST ENERGY SERVICES WERE ACTUALLY FRUSTRATED PARTY WHEN IT COMES TO SEE ES DE AS YOUR STAFF. ANALYSIS NOTES THERE'S BEEN AN ISSUE WITH THE FUNDING FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE COMING OUT OF CST WHEN THEY MADE A MAJOR CHANGE TO THE POLICY WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT. AFTER SOME FRUSTRATION WE'VE EVEN COME TO THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST WE ASK FOR CHANGE AND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED SOME COMPROMISE LANGUAGE THEY WOULD SUGGEST THE AGENCY WHEN IT. SAYS PRESS ANY MORE FUTURE MONEY OUT YOU WOULD TRY TO WORK WITH TRADITIONAL LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY. EVIDENCE OF THAT. I WANT TO BE CLEAR IF THE AGENCIES TRYING TO DO WITH FARM WORKER HOUSING. IN MULTI UNIT HOUSING WE ARE SUPER SUPPORTIVE AND IF TRADITIONAL LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN'T DO THAT IT IS FINE TAKE SOME FUNDING TO GO DO THAT. INSTEAD WITH THE AGENCIES DOWN IS A RIP THEM THE MONEY AWAY FROM THE LOCAL THE TRADITIONAL LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND THAT NO LONGER ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING AND USE OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE GROUND SO WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU HOLD THIS FUNDING OR PUT IN SOME KIND OF PROVISION TO MAKE SURE THAT. SOME FUNDING IS GOING TO GO TO LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO ARE LEVERAGING FEDERAL FUNDING THANK YOU. EXCELLENT POINT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MILES MILLER WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. NRDC SUPPORTS CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN -- CRITICAL AND IMMENSELY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM FOR MAINTAINING HEALTHY AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THE WEATHER IS ASIAN AND SOLAR INSTALLATIONS -- OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OFTEN FACING DISPROPORTIONATE AND YOU BURDENS. AND SETTLED HIGH NEED HIGH ENERGY BILLS THEY CANNOT AFFORD. LOGAN HOUSEHOLDS SPEND UP 215% OF THEIR INCOME ON ENERGY ALONE AND UP TO THREE TIMES AS MUCH OF THEIR INCOME ON ENERGY AS OTHER HOUSEHOLDS. THE THREE MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS LIVING MULTI FAMILY APARTMENTS FACE ADDITIONAL STRUCTURAL BARRIERS. THE RESULT IN EVEN GREATER DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY SERVICES AND FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO HOUSEHOLD HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE LOW INCOME ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS IN THE NATION FOR EXPANDING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY SERVICES. TO LOW INCOME AND MULTI FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS ACHIEVING ON AVERAGE 30% REDUCTIONS IN HOUSEHOLD ENERGY BILLS. AND 40% REDUCTIONS IN ENERGY USAGE THERE IS COMPREHENSIVE WHOLE BUILDING APPROACH. THE PROGRAM FILLS A CRITICAL GAP IN CLEAN ENERGY BILL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND SUPPORT HOUSING AND ENERGY AFFORDABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S. LOWEST INCOME RESIDENTS IN MULTI FAMILY RENTAL HOUSING. ACCORDINGLY WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT CONTINUED AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE ITS ABLE TO CONTINUE SERVING THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEE NORTHERN SUPPORT ANY IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] OPPOSE. ALL RIGHT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. MISS FRAZIER. HOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND THE VAST AMOUNT OF -- COMMUNITIES THAT YOU TRIED TO HELP. BACK IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION -- THERE WAS THE DEMISE OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE ID DE POPULATION. AND WE RE -- A MAJORITY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN A GROUP ON STRUCK COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. HAS THERE BEEN ANY EFFORT TO CREATE ANY KIND OF PROGRAM THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY AUGMENT THESE GROUP HOMES WITH THIS SOLAR PROCESS OR WHATEVER WERE MORE MONEY. THE MOST MONEY SAVINGS COULD ACTUALLY BE UTILIZED IN. THE TRAINING OF THESE ENVISIONED END OF THE ID POPULATION. OF AND ALSO IN IN HELPING. EACH ONE OF YOU. IN THE INTEGRATED WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. COMPONENT -- BECAUSE HE'S A LOT OF JOBS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS CAN ACTUALLY ACQUIRING DO. WITH HIGH LEVELS OF PROFICIENCY. BUT I'M I'M THINKING THAT YOU KNOW. WE CREATED A A COST. BY RELOCATING THEM WE THOUGHT WE WERE SAVING MONEY BUT IF WE WERE ABLE TO USE THIS PROGRAM ALSO BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW INCOME OR NO INCOME. THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY AGAIN THEN UTILIZE A SAVINGS FOR TRAINING. AND AND AND KIND OF CROSS HYBRID MODEL OF YOU CROSS UTILIZATION. I JUST I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE. MR WITH. YEAH JUST CURIOUS -- HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES YOU GO INTO? IS THAT BASED ON GREENHOUSE GONE ON THE GAC FUND AND THE ENVIRO SCAN. SO IS BASED ON THE VIRUS CAM. SO YOU DON'T GO IN ANY MY COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW GOING TO SOME OF THE POOREST COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORIA BECAUSE WE DON'T HIT. THE BENCH MARKS ON THE VIRUS SCAN BECAUSE WE HAVE CLEAN AIR AND WE HAVE CLEAN WATER WE GOT A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME. THE HUGE PROBLEM FOR ME. SPECIFICALLY THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM AND HOW IT'S CURRENTLY IS ADMINISTERED IT IS BASED ON THE CALAVERAS GREEN I THINK IT'S WRONG QUITE FRANKLY I GOT SOME REALLY POOR PEOPLE. IN REALLY AND AND REALLY DIFFICULT CLIMB METS AND THEY CAN'T GET ACCESS TO THIS I THINK IT'S UNFAIR WE DO HAVE THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT'S FEDERALLY FUNDED AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. SO WE DO HAVE A LOCAL ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. JUST WITH A DIFFERENT FUND SOURCE BUT I I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN. AND IF I CAN ADD -- AS A DIRECTOR STOP MENTION IN THEIR REMARKS THAT WE RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED TWO MILLION DOLLARS -- FROM THE GIRAFFE A THE FUN Là WOULD SINCE -- FISCAL YEAR FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND THE EARLY APPROPRIATIONS WERE LIMITED -- TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES EXCLUSIVELY HOWEVER SOME OF THE MORE RECENT -- APPROPRIATIONS DID PUT A ALLOW FOR CERTAIN A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OF INVESTMENTS TO BE MADE OUTSIDE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AND FOCUS MORE ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND SO WE UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT COMMUNITIES QUITE FRANKLY -- DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO WATER BY PROJECTS BUT WE DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE DECISION THE FUNDING THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. BASED ON THE G. G. R. F. AND I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE THAT'S ONE REASON YOU HEAR MEMBERS IN THIS. IN THIS IN THIS HOUSE TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRO SCANNED I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY UNFAIR -- TO COMMUNITIES AND RURAL RURAL AREAS THE STATE WHERE THE AIR QUALITY MIGHT BE GOOD. BECAUSE WE CAN'T CHECK ALL FOURTEEN BOXES. AND AND I I REPRESENT SOME OF THE PORTS ON THE POOREST THE THE THE LOOK AT THE MISTER AS AS MISTER MATHIS OVER THEIR NIGHT MEANT MISTER IS ANY BRING UP A GREAT POINT I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING A LOT OF US AGREE ON THAT WE COULD LOOK AT AS FAR. AS LANGUAGE MOVING FORWARD YEAH I JUST THINK IT NEEDS TO BE MORE EQUITABLE I MEAN. NOT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- THE COMMISSION OF MINE AND I'LL SHOW YOU AND THEN. BUT IN AGAIN THERE'S BEEN SO MANY FAT FACETS OF CALAVERAS SCREEN THAT WE HAVEN'T. AND THE BAY AREA OF NOT AGREED THAT IS AN EQUITABLE KIND OF SHARING OF OF PROCESS. WE THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE ANOTHER FORM OF FORMULA OR METHOD OF OF ALLOCATION. BASED ON NEEDNOT ON PERCEIVED HE ALL RIGHT MOVE THERE'S ANY NOTHING ELSE FROM THE DíAS -- GO AHEAD IN -- CLOSE UP ON THIS ISSUE AND MOVED TO ISSUE THREE AND I'LL PASSED THE GAVEL REMOVED OR NOT LOOK AT HER AND WE BACK TO THE CHURCH THE NOT A LIKE [inaudible] EXCUSE ME. ON THAT ISSUE NUMBER. TWO I KNOW THAT YOU WALDRON EXCUSE [inaudible] HELLO YEAH YEAH. I TRY TO GET BACK QUICKLY BUT NOT QUICK ENOUGH. I DO WANT TO DO THE L. CST -- ALL RIGHT I I DID WANT YOU TO DESCRIBE IT A BIT MORE DETAIL HOW YOUR ASSURING THAT THE SERVICE PROVIDERS. DO HAVE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE. ONE THING WE ARE VERY -- AWARE OF IS THE FACT THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO HAVE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT AND ENSURING THAT WERE HAVING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. SO WITH THE MOST RECENT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL WE HELD -- COMPREHENSIVE OF A STAKEHOLDER EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE WERE IN FRESNO WE GOT A REQUEST TO DO A STAKEHOLDER EVENT IN SALINAS WE WENT TO SALINAS THERE WAS AT LEAST -- I THINK FORTY DIFFERENT MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTED. WE DID INITIALLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE GETTING AS MUCH FEEDBACK AS WE POSSIBLY COULD AS WE LOOKED AT MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY TIES WHICH IS REALLY ESSENTIAL AND IMPORTANT. WAS BEING ACKNOWLEDGED AND SO WE TOOK THE INFORMATION BACK WE HELD WEBINARS AND RESPONDED TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE INQUIRIES THAT WE GOT FROM THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS. I'M AND WE ALSO -- WERE WERE VERY COGNIZANT ESPECIALLY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE DONE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AFTER A SB EIGHTY NINE WHICH HAD A THE VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND FOR THIS REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION OF FARM WORKER HOUSING WE REALLY FELT THAT THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF WHAT WE WERE TARGETING AS WELL AS THE LOW INCOME IN GENERAL. AND AS WELL AS THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY EXPERIENCE SO I I THINK THAT THE OF OUR OF P. THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND DID TAKE IN THAT FEEDBACK -- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT STILL ARE NOT AND WE HAVE A CONTRACTOR THE STILL IS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME BUT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT WAS VERY TRANSPARENT. AND AND HAD OF MULTIPLE FORMS AND AND MAYBE OTHERS -- WITH REGARD TO THOSE THAT WERE ON THE RECEIVING END OF EVERYTHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEAD FROM THE STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVE MIGHT BE BETTER TO FILL IN SOME INFORMATION IF THEY HAVEN'T LEFT. BUT I THINK I THINK -- MARCO COULD ALSO SPEAKS ABOUT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO HEAR FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS ON THE RECEIVING END OF OUR EFFORTS AROUND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT BEFORE YOU LEAVE AND I LAST MARK ON JUST A MOMENTYES IT. IS IS THERE A NEED FOR CAPACITY BUILDING. SO THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE HAVE. SO THAT THE COMMUNITY TIES ARE THERE -- WHEN WE WHEN WE DO IT? WHEN WE DO ISSUE THE CONTRACTS? ONE SPEAKS OUT RIGHT -- SO THAT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL -- INCLUDED -- REQUIREMENTS WHERE PROPOSES HAVE TO SPECIFY THEIR THE REGION'S THE REGIONAL AREAS THAT THEY WERE INTENDING TO SERVE -- SUBSTANTIATE THAT THEY HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL AS TO ELABORATE ON THEIR SERVICE CONNECTION TO THOSE AREAS BECAUSE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING PHYSICALLY IN THE AREA AND THEN BEING ABLE TO SERVICE THE AREA ABSOLUTELY -- SO IN IN ADDITION THE THE ART PIECE SCORED HIS SCORING RUBRIC THAT EMPHASIZE -- HIGHER POINTS TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT MET THOSE TWO KEY CRITERIA -- BUT TO SPECIFIC QUESTION ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE PROGRAM DOES FACE. IS THAT YOU KNOW THE HAVING SOME -- IT THE COTTON WITH THE IN FINDING -- BECAUSE THESE PUT THESE EFFORTS THAT WE UNDERTAKE FOR EACH. PROGRAM CYCLE -- ARC WE ARE ASKING A LOT OF OUR CONTRACTORS NOT ONLY ARE WE ASKING THEM TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM BUT WE ALSO ARE ASKING THEM TO BE INNOVATIVE IN THE LOOK AT WRAPAROUND SERVICES OR WORKFORCE DEVELOPING UP BETWEEN THESE THAT. CAN NIGHT THAT CAN COMPLEMENT THE THE CORE OBJECTIVES OF REDUCING GHG AS WELL AS REDUCING THE ENERGY BILLS FOR LOW INCOME. AND THOSE STRATEGIES SOMETIMES A LIMITED BECAUSE THE FUNDING IS SHORT TERM OR WE CAN'T SUSTAIN THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED AT EACH A PROGRAM CYCLE. AND SO THE THING IS WHAT YOU WERE HEARING FROM SOME OF THE MINISTRY THERE IS -- WAS THAT POINT OF ENSURING THAT THERE'S LONG TERM FINDING AND THAT WE CAN SUSTAIN SOME OF THESE EFFORTS LOCALLY. THAT IN THE GUIDANCE THAT WAS LISTED BY THE DEPARTMENT. ON COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE IT TALKED ABOUT REGIONAL. AS OPPOSED TO MORE SPECIFIC -- WHY WHAT WAS WIDE THAT THAT TERM -- WHY WAS THAT TERM USED SO THE TERM -- SO FOR THE FARM WORKER PROGRAM WE IDENTIFIED THE TWELVE COUNTIES THE HAD THE HIGHS FORMER CO POPULATION. BUT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAMMERS APPROXIMATE TEN MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS -- TO TO EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM SO WE WEEK ESTABLISHED TO SERVICE REGION'S WITH SIX COUNTIES EACH AND THEN -- WE ASKED PROPOSES TO DETAIL THEIR PLANS FOR HOW THEY WERE INTENDING TO MEETALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND ESTABLISH A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN SERVING. THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES THAT MAKE UP EACH REGION AREA SO -- THAT'S BASICALLY HOW THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED SO THAT YOU NICELY ENCOMPASSES -- AN ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT -- SERVICES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU[inaudible] MR ETCETERA -- QUESTION. THERE IS NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ABOUT HAVING A TIES TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING TO BUY ENSURE THAT -- THOSE WHO WERE CONTRACTED DID HAVE COMMUNITY TIES AND BECAUSE YOU WERE ON THE RECEIVING AND TO HOW HOW WAS THAT. QUESTION ELSTOW WAS THAT -- HOW IMPORTANT WAS THAT IN YOU? APPLYING FOR AND RECEIVING THIS. THE TWO OF YOU FOR EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT FITS US. EVEN THE FACT THAT WE ARE AN ASSOCIATION THAT SPREAD OUT THROUGH THIRTY FOUR PORT COUNTIES WITH OFFICES ACTUALLY WITH EIGHTY TWO ACCESS POINT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROGRAM WHERE. ARE YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE PEOPLE THE QUALIFIED BY CENSUS TRACKS. OKAY SO YOU MIGHT HAVE AN AREA WITH FEW CENSUS TRACKS SO YOU COMBINED INTO OUR REGION. NOW YOU HAVE THE QUANTITY THAT MAKES IT A LOT MORE FEASIBLE ECONOMICALLY AND USE ECONOMIC. CONSCIOUS SCALE TO DO THAT SO THE REGIONAL MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO US AND WE HAVE BEEN IN HAVE YOU KNOW OFFICE SYSTEM A LOT OF IS THAT LITTLE TINY SMALL TOWNS. BROUGHT. IT ALL ALL THE WAY TO IMPERIAL VALLEY TO CALEXICO. AND PEOPLE KNOW US WE WERE THERE FOR FIFTY YEARS THAT WE HAVE SOME TRUST. AND THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN SERVING THIS COMMUNITIES TODAY. BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SCAMS. IT ALL WITH SOLAR PANEL INSTALLATIONS THAT HAVE GONE OUT IN FACT WE RUN INTO THAT. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING MADAM CHAIR. WELL THEY ALL CAME BACK I HAD MORE QUESTIONS ON GETTING ALL RIGHT. ISSUE NUMBER. THREE I DO WANT TO WELCOME THE NEW DIRECTOR THANK YOU -- ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON WHEN UNIQUE WHEN YOU'D LIKE AFTERNOON THAT DAY BECAUSE WE'RE DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES -- BEFORE YOU TODAY IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- FOR THE CHOPPER PROGRAMS INCREASE FUNDING [inaudible] THIS INITIATIVE SEARCH THREE MAJOR PURPOSES FOR OUR ORGANIZATION -- AS THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED ONE OF HIS MAJOR PARTIES IS -- THIS BATTLE AND AND CHALLENGE AGAINST POVERTY WITH CALIFORNIA. THE CHARLES FOR PROGRAM. FLEX OVER TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO BILLION OF THAT GOES TOWARDS THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. OF THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES THAT THIS PARTICULAR FUNDING IS GOING TOWARDS -- HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES IN THE STATE A AN AVERAGE OF FIFTEEN POINT 1% -- AS OPPOSED -- TO AND SOME AS HIGH AS 21% IN FRESNO KERN MADERA -- THE SECOND PIECE OF THIS FUNDING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- TO THE ADMINISTRATION IS THIS NEED TO IMPROVE SELF SUFFICIENCY MUCH THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE -- CHILD SUPPORT IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AS INCOME ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SERVICES IN THESE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES IN PARTICULAR ARE ARE BROUGHT UP TO THE SAME STAND LEVEL OF SUPPORT THAT. AND THE REST OF THE STATE IS RECEIVING HAVE THE LAST PIECES ABOUT FINDING A QUALITY THERE'S BIG DISPARITY IN A BIG GAP BETWEEN THE LOS FUND COUNTIES IN HIGH SPENDING COUNTIES IN THE EFFORT TO DELIVER CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. THE TWENTY ONE IDENTIFIED HERE -- ON AVERAGE GET ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED ONE DOLLARS PER CASE WHILE THE REMAINING STAKE IT'S ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR DOLLARS PER CASE. THIS FUNDING METHODOLOGY IN THE THE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO BRING IN I'M PUTS -- BASELINE FUNDING -- EXPECTATION OUT THERE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE AND THIS IS MINIMUM THRESHOLD THAT WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT FOR CARRYING OUT THE BUSINESS OF CHILD SUPPORT. SO THAT WE'VE GOT THAT EQUITY ACROSS THE AND START IT INTERSTATE IS NOT HERE SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE DEPARTMENT TWO THOUSAND ONE THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL ATTEMPTS AT FUNDING METHODOLOGIES NONE OF COME THROUGH. THEM SO FAR AND SO THERE'S BEEN NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ALLOCATIONS OF THE LOCAL TRANSFERRED AGENCIES EXCEPT FOR PEACE MINOR -- INFLUXES OF MONEY SINCE THAT TIME SO WE'RE HOPING TO RECTIFY THAT HIM AND GET SOMETHING MOVING FORWARD -- IF YOU'D LIKE WE CAN GO THROUGH THAT BUDGET PROPOSAL A BIT MORE DETAIL. I THINK THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. INTRODUCED MANSION OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THANK HIGH SOME. HER NAME'S MANSION AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY COME TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES REQUEST ONE POINT ONE BILLION THREE HUNDRED THREE NINE NINE GENERAL FUND FOR FISCAL YEAR TWO IN. NINETEEN I'M THIS IS AN INCREASE OF SIXTY ONE MILLION COMPARED TO THE UNITED BUDGET. THE SIX SEVEN MAJORITY OR FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS I'M OF THIS INCREASES FOR THE APARTMENTS LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY BUDGET ALLOCATION PROPOSAL -- IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CYCLE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH THE CHILD SUPPORTDIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. TO SOLVE THE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY FUNDING ISSUE THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED FAMILY CODE SEVENTEEN SEVEN OH FIVE WHICH QUALIFIES THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN DECSS AND CSTA TOWARDS THIS EFFORT. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID WE SET FORWARD -- TO WORK TOGETHER AND THE RESULT OF THIS EFFORT WAS PUT FORWARD IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE PROPOSAL REQUESTS FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS NINETEEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN. NINETEEN TWENTY A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OR SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THIS REQUEST IS BASED ON AN IMPROVED LCS ALLOCATION OF METHODOLGY DOES BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM VOTE WAS PUT FORWARD IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE PROPOSAL THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY CONTINUES TO USE THE IDEOLOGY. OF A CASE TO F. T. RATIO BUT GOES FURTHER TO BUILD OUT OTHER COMPONENTS NECESSARY TO FUND LCS THE OPERATIONS. AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING A CASE F. T. E. RATIO BASED ON WORKLOAD PATRICK'S. THIS REPRESENTS A BALANCED APPROACH OF IMPROVING CUSTOMER OUTCOMES THE FAMILIES ADDRESSING LCS A CURRENT AND FUTURE COST PRESSURES AND EFFICIENCIES OF SHARED SERVICES. FUNDAMENTALLY THE METHODOLOGY ENCOMPASSES THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS BASE LEVEL OF STAFFING FOR CASE WORK OPERATIONS CALL CENTER OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES. IT IS BUILT UPON I CORPS UNDERSTANDING OF THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WAS THE HOLD HARMLESS DEAL CSA'S THAT WORK BETTER CURRENTLY FUNDED MORE THAN WHAT THE METHODOLOGY CALCULATED. THIS WOULD AVOID STAFFING LAYOFFS THAT WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT COUNTY PERFORMANCE. BUT IT WOULD ALSO SET AN EXPECTATION THAT THESE -- CSA'S WILL MANAGE THEIR EXISTING RESOURCES THROUGH ATTRITION TELL COST PRESSURES BRING THEM UP TO THE CALCULATED ALLOCATION. THE CURRENT STATE WHAT ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WELL THE REALLY IS LACKEY METHODOLOGY TODAY. AND THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO FIND SALARIES AND WAGES INCREASES BENEFIT INCREASES THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO GROSS -- OVER THE LAST DECADE -- SAYS IS HAVE OPERATED THROUGH STAFFING REDUCTIONS AND AT RISK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE DEGRADATION PRODUCTIONS CONTINUE -- THE AGENDA DOES A GREAT JOB OF EXPLAINING THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE FUNDING FORMULA SO KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. MY NAME IS MARIE -- LET I'M THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES DIRECTOR. THANK YOU AND WELCOME I LOVE HEARING THE WORD SAN BERNADINO NOW. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR IS IN A STEAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF NOT ONLY SAN BERNADINO BUT ALSO THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF WHICH I AM THE TREASURE. AS WELL AS THE FORTY NINE MEMBERS OF THAT ASSOCIATION. THE FUNDING PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU ALIGNS VERY WELL WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S LARGER POLICY GOALS OF LIFTING CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY. THIS INCREASE IN LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT FUNDING WILL RESULT IN BETTER LIVES FOR ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. THE STATE'S INVESTMENT OF NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION IS MATCH TWO TO ONE WITH AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY SIX POINT NINE MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS. THE UNDERLYING BUDGETING METHODOLOGY IS INTENDED TO BE ROLLED OUT OVER FOUR YEARS. REGIONAL CALL CENTER FUNDING IS INCLUDED FOR MERE ONE AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE FUNDS ARE ADDED TO THE METHODOLOGY IN YOUR FOR THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION HAS WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES TO DETERMINE THE FUNDING NEEDS OF LOCAL. VOTE OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND TO IDENTIFY THOSE COUNTIES WITH THE LOWEST LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THEIR CASE SIZE. AS IT HAPPENS THOSE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES ARE ALSO AMONG THE POOREST OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. THE IMPACT OF LIMITED FUNDING ON POVERTY AVOIDANCE IS CLEAR LESS SPENDING RESULTS IN GREATER INSTANCE OF POVERTY. AND THAT IS EQUALLY TRUE IN CHILD SUPPORT. CHILD SUPPORT IS MANDATED BY FEDERAL REGULATION THE OFFICE OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT UNDER THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION OF CHILDREN'S AND FAT CHILDREN FAMILIES. HAS RECENTLY PROMULGATED WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE FINAL RULE. MOST OF THESE CHANGES TO THE VARIOUS STATES PROGRAMS IN THE FINAL RULE REQUIRE A SHIFT FROM SYSTEM GENERATED TASKS TO A MORE HUMAN CENTRIC TASK. THAT HUMAN CENTRIC MODE WILL LIKELY BE MORE COSTLY THAN THE SYSTEM GENERATED PROGRAM WITH MIGRATED TO UNDER PRESSURE OF LIMITED FUNDING. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN SOCIAL POLICY AND HAS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED MOST OF THE FINAL RULE RECOMMENDATIONS HOWEVER MANY LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES LACKS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT REMAINING FEDERAL CHANGES. AND REACH ADDITIONAL FAMILIES THAT COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES IDENTIFIED IN THE PROPOSED FUNDING HAVE BEEN TREADING WATER HOWEVER EACH YEAR WITH THE LIMITED FUNDS AVAILABLE THEY OFFER INNOVATIVE SERVICES INCLUDING. REFERRALS FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES POP UP AND MOBILE OFFICES OUT REACH TO INCARCERATED PARENTS ESTABLISHING ORDERS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE AND DEVELOPING ACHIEVABLE PAYMENT PLANS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN FUNDING BETWEEN COUNTIES WHICH AFFECTS PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE TO FAMILIES. THE PROPOSED SPENDING IS A PRELIMINARY STEP TOWARD A REASONABLE FUNDING METHODOLOGY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. WE SUPPORT ALL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST REITERATE A LOT OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID WHICH IS THAT. THEY'LL SAY SAY FUNNY PROPOSALS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY CHILDHOOD BUDGET PACKAGE WHICH IS ONE OF HIS PRIORITIES. SPECIFICALLY THIS INVESTMENT IS INTENDED TO EASE THE FINANCIAL PRESSURES ON PARENTS THINKING ESCAPE THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND FOCUS ON THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. OF THEIR CHILDREN THE ADMINISTRATION VIEWS THIS INVESTMENT AS A BASELINE ADJUSTMENT TO CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE FUNDING DISTRIBUTION ACROSS ALL COUNTIES AND REDUCE GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN FUNDING. AFTER FULL IMPLEMENTATION THE INCREASE COLLECTIONS RESULTING FROM THIS INVESTMENT WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT FAMILIES AND REDUCE CHILD POVERTY PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE LCS SAYS THEY'RE CURRENTLY RELATIVELY UNDERFUNDED. AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. JACQUELINE ROSY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- A FEW WEEKS AGO OUR OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT IN WHICH WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IN THE REPORT WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT YES THERE AND IS CONCERNED ABOUT FINDING AND HOW THAT IS -- DECIDED IN TERMS OF FUNDING LEVELS FOR EACH LTSA -- WITH REGARD TO THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THE PROPOSED NEW METHODOLOGY WE DID RAISE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS -- ONE BEING THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S PREMATURE FOR TWO REASONS -- AS WAS NOTED -- IN THE AGENDA ON LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE DID PASS SOME REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRED THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK FOR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES BOTH OF THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. THAT WOULD THEN AND FORMER FINE MINTS TO THE BUDGET METHODOLOGY THAT SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES IS DUE BY. JULY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN I'M GIVEN THAT THAT IS PENDING -- DEPENDING ON THE FINDINGS OF THAT REPORT -- THOSE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES COULD HAVE SOME IMPLICATIONS ON BOTH THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO DO -- EVERYDAY TASK OR RUN -- ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM -- BUT THEN ALSO -- DOES A COULD -- INFORM DIFFERENCES AND FUNDING LEVELS AND ALSO HOW FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED ACROSS ALL CSA'S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE FLAGS THAT THIS PROPOSAL THAT THE METHODOLOGY IN AND OF ITSELF MAY BE PREMATURE. AS WAS MENTIONED THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDERGOING -- A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE FEDERAL FINAL RULE -- AS WAS NOTED SOME OF THESE COMPONENTS -- COULD AFFECT -- EVERYDAY OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM EITHER REQUIRING MORE -- HUMAN CENTERED TOUCHES THAT COULD THEN REQUIRE HIGHER LEVELS OF A EFFORT -- BUT THEN ALSO MORE COST -- SO UNTIL WE HAVE A PLANT ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT WE FIND THAT [inaudible] I'M. ADOPTING OF BUDGET METHODOLOGY MAY BE PREMATURE AT THAT TIME SETTING ON THOSE DIVIDE TWO CONCERNS ASIDE WE DID REVIEW THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL AND ALSO RAISED A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL CONCERNS. I'M SOME OF THAT INCLUDES -- IN IT AND THERE ARE SET AS IN THE CALCULATION OF BASELINE STAFFING LEVELS A LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN WHICH THEY SURVEYED FIFTEEN COUNTIES. LOOK DAD A MANDATED TASK TASK THAT ARE NEEDED JUST TO WORK AS AN EVERYDAY CHILD SUPPORT CASE -- AND THEN TRY TO TIME EACH TASK OUT TO THEN DETERMINE THE NECESSARY -- EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S REQUIRED TO WORK A CASE. THAT LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDY ONLY PARTIALLY INFORMED TO THE OVERALL BASE LEVEL OF STAFF. THAT THEY REACHED BUT EVEN WITHIN THAT LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDY IT DID DEMONSTRATE WIDE VARIATION AND HOW THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED ACROSS ALSEA ESSAYS -- AGAIN THAT IN IT OF ITSELF -- DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF WIDE VARIATION IN HOW THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED AND THAT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THEN EVALUATE OUR THEIR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES OR BEST PRACTICES THAT COULD BE LEARNED FROM CERTAIN LC ESSAYS. AND THEN IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE SYSTEM ON THE PROPOSAL AS OPPOSED OF TAKING THAT APPROACH OF FUNDING TO THE BEST PRACTICE LEVEL JUST -- PICKED AN AVERAGE -- SO IT HAS THOSE BIG TEN VARIATIONS AND THE PROPOSAL ITSELF AND LASTLY AS AS WAS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA. THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT -- KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE MISSING THAT -- WOULD FACILITATE SOME FORM OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BOTH IN TERMS OF KNOWING HOW THE DOLLARS ARE SPENT ULTIMATELY BUTALSO A LACK OF METRICS OR A LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA GAP -- FROM THE DOLLARS I'M IN THE REPORT. AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF MY COMMENTS WE DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FUNDING IS A CONCERN -- SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO IN THE MEANTIME IS THAT WHILE IT'S DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY ASSESS WHICH ALL CSA'S. MAY BE UNABLE TO PERFORM CORE FUNCTIONS YOU TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE STOP GAP FUNDING. AND ONE OF ONE OPTION IN THAT STOP GAP FUNDING COULD BE TO PROVIDE AN INFLATION ADJUSTMENT TO ALL LCS SEASON -- TWENTY NINETEEN THAT THAT'S JUST AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT FUNDING IS AN ISSUE SOME OF THESE CAN COMPONENTS LIKE THE LEGISLATIVE REPORT THAT'S DUE JULY FIRST AND THE APPROACH TO THE FEDERAL FINAL ROLE ARE PENDING. AND ONCE WE GET FURTHER CLARITY ON THAT I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO THEN READJUST AND TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF ACTUAL FUNDING NEEDS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. WE'RE ALL DONE. ALL RIGHT -- WHY DON'T WE OPEN THIS UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT THEM SOMEBODY FIRST. SORRY HAVE LOST A BIT OF MY VOICE. HI MY NAME IS NATALIE DAILY -- I'M THE DIRECTOR OF A COLUSA SATTAR AND YOLO COUNTIES CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES. ALTHOUGH THESE THREE COUNTIES ARE NOT PART OF THE TWENTY ONE SLATED FOR THE ENHANCED FUNDING RECOGNIZED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET METHODOLOGY. WE ALL THREE COUNTIES ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS FUNDING METHODOLOGY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I IS PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION CO FACILITATED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE WORK GROUP THAT DEVELOPED THIS FUNDING METHODOLOGY. IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE THAT WE IMPLEMENT THIS FUNDING METHODOLOGY SO THAT IN THREE YEARS WE CAN REPORT ON ITS EFFICACY AND HOW IT'S ADDRESSED TO A POT CHILD POVERTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU AND IS FOR THESE REASONS AUTHOR KENNY SUPPORT THE SPENDING THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON -- JODY HAYES CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR STANISLAUS COUNTY. HERE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- CHILD SUPPORT DOES TREMENDOUS WORK IN A COMMUNITY YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD MUCH OF THAT IN THE STAFF COMMENTS -- IN STANISLAUS COUNTY WE GENERATE ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR SPENT. WE SERVE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND CHILDREN BRING IN FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS PROPOSAL PUTS US AT LEAST ON A PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY IN THE FUTURE WHERE AS WE'VE BEEN FLAT FUNDED FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS NOW IN THIS PROGRAM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS HIGHLIGHTED IS THAT WE'RE LEVERAGING TWO DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR EVERYONE DOLLAR OF STATE FUNDS IN THIS PROPOSAL -- BUT THERE ARE NUMEROUS BENEFITS -- MANY OF WHICH WERE ALREADY MENTIONED HERE. THIS PUTS FOOD DIRECTLY ON THE TABLE IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND IT HURT IN IT HELPS SOME OF THOSE I AM MOST NEEDY -- DEFINITELY IMPROVE SELF SUFFICIENCY IN OUR COMMUNITY WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON STANISLAUS COUNTY AND THE ONE ITEM THAT WE HAVE NOTICED -- THE MOST OUR COMMUNITY ARE THOSE STORIES OF REUNIFICATION OF PARENTS IT'S NOT WHAT USUALLY GETS TALKED ABOUT IN THE CHILD SUPPORT. A CONVERSATION -- BUT SOME OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF POSITIVE WORK AND IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAPPEN OUR CHILD SUPPORT DEPARTMENT WHEN WE DO HAVE RENO YEAH REUNIFIED FAMILIES. AN ABSENTEE PARENTS THAT AND TO THE LIVES OF THEIR CHILDREN AGAIN THAT PAYS NOT JUST THE TWO TO ONE AND THE FOUR TO ONE RATIO THAT PACE. MUCH MUCH MORE DOWNSTREAM IN THIS PROCESS SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SURE WARDELL TRY HOME THE DIRECTOR OF THE MERCED MARIPOSA REGIONAL DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES -- MY COUNTIES SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET AND APPRECIATE HIS RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK THAT OUR PROGRAM DOES. THE CHOPPER PROGRAM'S TERMS OF THE MARKET COMMUNITIES MOST FRAGILE FAMILIES IN MERCED COUNTY 44% OF FAMILIES WITH SINGLE MOTHERS ARE LIVING IN POVERTY AND 27% OF CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. OUR LOCAL PROGRAM CREATES ECONOMIC SELF SUFFICIENCY FOR THE FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. OF THE TWENTY SIX MILLION COLLECTED LAST YEAR OVER TWENTY THREE MILLION WENT DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES -- EITHER. FORMALLY OFF AID OR HAVE NEVER RECEIVED AID. AS A RURAL COMMUNITY STILL RECOVERING FROM THE LAST RECESSION THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM IS A NECESSARY AND VALUABLE TOOL IN OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE POVERTY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DOCTOR STEPHEN GOLIGHTLY I'M DIRECTOR OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. I SPENT OVER FOUR DECADES OF MY LIFE WORKING AND PROGRAMS FOCUSING ON LOW INCOME CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE CHILD SUPPORT. ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX AND ONE OF THE MOST REWARDING PROGRAMS I'VE EVER WORKED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. BOB WE KNOW THAT TO A CHILD SUPPORT IS ONE OF THE TOP THREE ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMS IN THE NATION. LAST YEAR IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE COLLECTED ALMOST ONE HALF OF THE BILLION DOLLARS. 88% OF OUR COLLECTIONS WENT DIRECTLY TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. WE HAVE. MILLION CASES LOCATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES AND THIRTY NINE FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THROUGHOUT WERE A BIG OPERATION AND I GET TO SEE EVERY DAY THE IMPACT IN OUR LOBBY SO FAMILIES AND CHILDREN THE COMMAND. WHEN I SIT AND TALK TO THEM? NOT EVERYONE IS HAPPY OBVIOUSLY BUT IN THE INSTANCES WHERE WE'RE ABLE TO SEE DIRECTLY HOW THE FUNDS THAT WE COLLECT. CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF PEOPLE THAT ARE LOW INCOME AND POOR WE'RE WORKING CONTINUOUSLY. TO REDO OUR BUSINESS MODEL TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE OUR MOTTO WE STAY CONTINUOUSLY AS WE SERVE ONE FAMILY AT A TIME -- WE ARE NOT SURPRISINGLY OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND QUITE FRANKLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE CASELOAD SIZE SO THAT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF SERVING THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN OUR BACKYARD. THANK YOU.

MY DEPARTMENT IS HOME TO ONE OF THE STATE'S EXIST EXISTING CALL CENTERS IN ADDITION TO OUR OWN CALLS WE WE SERVE NINE OTHER CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES.

MORE THAN MONEY RUNNING A CALL CENTER REQUIRES SKILL AND TRAINING AND WE'RE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE TO OTHER CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES -- WE DO IT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN TRYING TO HELP THE PROGRAM BECOME BETTER. THE PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE THIS TYPE OF INNOVATION AND STATEWIDE EFFICIENCY FOR THESE REASONS EVEN THOUGH BIãU WOULD NOT BE A RECIPIENT OF THE OF THE FUNDING -- WE SUPPORT THE THE FUNNY PROPOSAL FOR THE REASONS I STATED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR REYES MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LAURIE CRUZ I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES.

TRANSPORT PROGRAM HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN PERCEIVED AS A COLLECTION REMEDY THAT FOCUSES ON REIMBURSING THE GOVERNMENT FOR ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS. THAT PERCEPTION IS NO LONGER REALITY IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY THE CHILD SUPPORT TEAM COLLECTED SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. IN FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR 171886% OF THOSE DOLLARS WENT DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES AND CHILDREN IN MY COUNTY TO PARENTS TO PAY FOR CHILDREN'S FOOD CLOTHING AND THEIR OTHER NEEDS. FOR FRAGILE FAMILIES THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM IS AN ANTI POVERTY MEASURE. IN CALIFORNIA 18% OF CHILDREN UP TO AGE. SEVENTEEN LIVE IN HOMES WHERE THE ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS OF NO MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. CHILD SUPPORT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT AND SUPPORTING CHILDREN. WHOSE PARENTS OR LESSEN THE FEDERAL POVERTY THRESHOLD. IN FACT CHILD SUPPORT MAKES UP ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED FAMILIES. THE GOVERNOR'S FUNDING REQUEST FOR LOCAL TRIALS FOR AGENCIES ONE ABLE UNDERFUNDED TOLD FOR AGENCIES TO HIRE ADDITIONAL CASE WORKERS. THAT ARE VITALLY NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE CASE WORK TO TURN A PERRANCE REQUEST FOR HELP. INTO A CHILD SUPPORT JUDGMENT IN TURN SURE THAT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES RECEIVED CONSISTENT. AND RELIABLE CHILD FOR EACH MONTH. WENT BY THE WAY I LIVE IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY NOT LONG AGO. YEAH A WELCOME BACK WHEN YOU WANT TO COME BACK. JUSTIN GARRETT CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- ONE EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE GOVERNOR IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR INCLUDING THIS IN THE CHILDHOOD POVERTY PACKAGE.

SINCE TWO THOUSAND OUR STAFFING LEVEL HAS GONE FROM A HIGH OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES TO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FULL TIME EMPLOYEES TODAY. WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN UR BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR THE NEXT STATE FISCAL YEAR AT THE CURRENT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FULL TIME EMPLOYEE LEVEL 91% OF MY FUNDING FOR OUR COUNTY. WILL BE USED FOR SALARY AND BENEFITS WHICH MEANS THAT I HAVE TO CUT POSITIONS. WE'VE BEEN KNOWN IN CONTRA COSTA AS AN INNOVATOR OF TECHNOLOGY TO AUTOMATE AS MANY OF THE WORK FUNCTIONS THAT WE CAN AND WE ARE OUT OF THE ABILITY TO DO THAT WE'VE AUTOMATED EVERYTHING THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN. IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR THE DWINDLING STAFFING WE DESPERATELY NEED AN INCREASE IN OUR FUNDING AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON TOP OF THE CURRENT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WHEN THAT CHILD SUPPORT DEPARTMENTS FOR SPLIT OUT OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS ABOUT.

SINCE TWO THOUSAND NAUTICAL AND NOTHING SO WHATEVER DOLLAR AMOUNT YOU GOT IS WHAT YOU GET. AND AS PART OF THAT AGREEMENT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A FORMULA ACTUALLY STYLISH BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ONE AT THE TIME. THREE EFFORTS ROUNDER TAKEN BY THE STATE TO DEVELOP A FORMULA AND THEY NEVER REACHED WHEN. THEY'RE HERE BEFORE YOU THE WHOLE ASSOCIATION EVEN THE COUNTIES ARE GETTING ANYBODY TO TELL YOU THAT THEY REACHED AGREEMENT. SO WE HEAR THE LA -- INSANE YOU KNOW THERE'S A REPORT COMING ON JULY ONE WILL JULY WHEN IS UNFORTUNATELY JUST WHEN THE NEW BUDGET START SO WE'RE HOPING THAT -- THE FUNDING CAN MOVE OUT AND THEY CAN MAKE REFINEMENTS TO THE FORMULAS THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD BUT THEY FINALLY REACHED A FORMULA SO PLEASE DON'T LET THAT WERE CUT AWAY THREE URGE YOUR APPROVAL AND THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR IS A PERMANENT FINANCE FOR INCLUDING THIS.

ALAMEDA COUNTIES -- STRONGLY APPRECIATES AND IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECOGNITION. OF THE IMPORTANCE THE CHILD SUPPORT PAID PLAYS IN HELPING CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY. AS THE DIRECTOR OF ALAMEDA COUNTY AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. MY COLLEAGUES AND I REALLY UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT WE PLAY AND THAT CHILD SUPPORT IS A SAFETY NET FOR FAMILIES. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE HAVE OVER THIRTY ONE THOUSAND CASES WE COLLECTED OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR AND 84% FAN OF THAT. COLLECTION WENT TO THE FAMILIES. WE HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY AND THE NUMBERS. BUT THE REAL DISCUSSION IS THAT THIS FUNDING HAS AN IMPACT A HUMAN IMPACT TO THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. IN ALAMEDA AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AND ALAMEDA NOT OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT. WE REALLY STRONGLY -- WHICH WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO EXCEPT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO I FIGURE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT -- TERREUS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CRAIG WILSON I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CHILD SUPPORT ASSOCIATION -- WE OF COURSE AS A BIG PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS BIG BEFORE YOU GO AND THE AUTHOR OF THE LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDY ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE NEW FUNDING. TO MISS NANCY IS POINT THAT THIS IS -- HUMAN EFFORT THE MONEY THAT'S COLLECTED FROM ONE PARENT AND PROVIDED TO ANOTHER -- VIA THE WORK THAT THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS DO THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S PUTS CHEERIOS ON THE TABLE SPEAKERS ON THE FIGHT ON THE FEET OF THE CHILDREN. AND A BACKPACK FOR THEM TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH AND ABSOLUTELY DOES IMPACT CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE MEASURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN IN WEEKS AND MONTHS SIX MONTHS IS A LONG TIME IN A CHILD'S LIFE A YEAR IS A LONG TIME IN A CHILD'S LIFE. EIGHTEEN YEARS IT'S AN ENTIRE CHILD'S LIFE AND WE'VE GONE EIGHTEEN YEARS WITHOUT A FUNDING INCREASE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS ANYMORE MONTHS OR WEEKS IN THE CHILDREN'S LIVES WE WOULD URGE YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA BARTH LOW IN THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE A CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM WE HAVE AGENCIES IN AT THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE DOING THE JOB OF COLLECTING FROM THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENT -- THE THE MONEY OWED TO THE CUSTODIAL PARENT OR FOR THE CASE OF WELFARE RECIPIENTS TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REMEMBER THAT FOR THOSE RECIPIENTS ONLY FIFTY DOLLARS. OF THE BENEFIT IS PASSED THROUGH A TO THEM FOR MOST CASES -- WE THINK THAT THESE AGENCIES SHOULD BE. WELL STAFFED THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE ON THE BILL FAMILIES IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE'RE WE'RE HOPING TO BE PART OF THE SHIFT TO MORE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT -- MORE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR FOR BOTH PARENTS TO HELP THEM DO THE GOOD JOB OF GOOD PARENTING AND SUB AND BECAUSE SUPPORTER OF THIS CHILD -- AND SO OUR SUPPORT OF OF OF THE EFFORT TO TO CORRECTLY AND ADEQUATELY FUND ON THIS WORK YOU WILL SEE OUR PROPOSAL THAT WE HOPE CAN ACCOMPANY THIS FUNDING -- AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT ITEM -- BUT WOULD JUST LIKE TO GO ON RECORD TO SAY THAT WERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS WE THINK THAT PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVANTS SHOULD PROVIDE THIS WORK AND WE THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE FUNDED TO DO IT. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS YES MOST FRAZIER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'M LOOKING ON PAGE. TWENTY THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PERFORMANCE -- IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE. THE RATIO TOTAL COLLECTIONS TO TOTAL PROGRAM COST. CAN SOMEBODY SHARE WITH ME IS THAT TWO DOLLARS FIFTY CENTS PER DOLLAR RECOVERED. IT'S STILL AS A FIFTY CENTS DISTRIBUTED OUT AM PER DOLLAR A CUSTOMER IN THE PROGRAM. OKAY SO WHAT WAS THE EFFICIENCIES PER. FOR FOR MONEY SPENT WHAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED. FROM WHEN WE HAVE THAT. OUR BUDGET IS ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN AND WE DISTRIBUTE OUT THE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SO THAT'S THE TWO DOLLARS OF IT AS A RECOVERY. THE RECOVERY P. SPECIFICALLY IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS GOES TOWARDS RECOVERY 50% THAT GOES TO THE FEDS TO RECOVER ON THEIR BEHALF. RETAIN FORTY SEVEN POINT 5% OF THAT AND THE TWO POINT 5% IS RECOUPED IN RETURN TO THE COUNTIES. OKAY. SO THERE'S A REPORT THAT SAYS IT'S DUE IN. JULY FIRST I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT -- COULD WE HAVE ACCELERATED THAT DATE BEFORE BUDGET. SO THAT WE COULD BE MORE INFORMED. A GOING FOR I KNOW WE ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRAILER BILL LATER. BUT WHY WOULDN'T WE HAVE IT BEFORE MAY REVISE SO WE WERE GIVEN. TO REQUIREMENTS LAST YEAR TO THE BUDGET CYCLE ONE WAS TO CREATE THIS METHODOLOGY IN THE SECOND WAS TO WORK ON EFFICIENCIES -- SO WE SPENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRST PART OF LAST YEAR -- GELLING INTO JANUARY THIS YEAR TRYING TO GET THAT BUDGET METHODOLOGY IN PLACE IN TIME FOR THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT HIS BUDGET AS SOON AS THAT WAS AND WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO DEFICIENCIES REPORT. THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO TRY AND GET THAT OUT BY JULY FIRST. SOARING APRIL DO YOU HAVE A DRAFT. WE HAVE A AT THE START OF CHAPTER THINK ALL OF THE PIECES ARE PUT TOGETHER WORKING ON THE FINALIZATION THERE. THERE ARE EFFICIENCIES IN IT THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THEIR NOT EFFICIENCIES IN THAT REPORT THAT ARE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN% SAVINGS TOWARDS MOVING AS A LOT OF THE EFFICIENCIES THAT WE ARE BEING. WE ARE HIGHLIGHTING AND REALLY GO TOWARDS MORE EFFICIENTLY DELIVERING THE SERVICES THAN THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THE CALL CENTER RE AT REGIONALIZATION THE CALL CENTERS WAS A A BIG COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES IN THE TRAINING ENVIRONMENT AND A FEW THINGS LIKE THAT TO REGIONALES TRAININGS AND REALIZE SOME OF THE SPECIALTY TYPE SERVICES. THE CORE OF WHAT WE DO THOUGH AT THE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES IS ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL SITTING IN FRONT OF FAMILY -- AND WORKING ON THEIR FINANCIAL ISSUES TO GET IT OUT THERE SO THERE ISN'T A WHOLE LOT MORE WE'VE ALREADY SPENT TWO DECADES REALLY TRYING TO REFINE OURSELVES AND MAINTAIN SERVICES WITH THAT WITH THE DWINDLING RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. THAT BEING SAID WHAT IS YOUR RETENTION RATE ON YOUR CASE MANAGERS -- GOING FORWARD I MEAN -- HEARING OTHER AGENCIES -- SAYING HER EMPLOYEES ARE UNDERPAID. AND FIND BETTER PAYING JOBS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHAT'S YOUR RETENTION READER YOUR AVERAGE -- STAY FOR YOUR EMPLOYER YOUR OF TV'S AND I DON'T HAVE THAT FOR EVERY COUNTY BUT IN MY TOUR DAY GETTING TO THE STATE SPOT I'VE BEEN IN FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTIES TO LARRY LOS ANGELES SAM AND DEAN ON RIVER SIGN IN AND ALL OF THOSE INSTANCES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF STAFF STAY IN THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR VERY LONG TIME AS AN AFFECT THEM I DARE SAY THAT THE THE DIRECTORS ARE ACTUALLY FACING A LARGE CONTINGENT STAFF THAT ARE READY TO RETIRE AND WALK OUT THE DOOR. AND SO THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN GEARING UP TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO REPLACE THOSE BUT FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE OF THE CLASSIFICATION THE COR CASE WORKER CLASSIFICATION. WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF TURNOVER IN THAT IN THAT TOWN IN THAT ROLE THANK THEM FOR ME I CERTAINLY WILL [inaudible] DOCTOR WOULD. I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND OF COURSE IT HAS TO DO WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LA -- OF BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION ENVISIONS A HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ASSURE ACCOUNTABILITY. UNDERSTANDING THAT. MY COUNTY STANDS TO GAIN SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AFTER LOS ANGELES -- SUMMER TO DO NO COUNTY WOULD RECEIVE THE HIGHEST AMOUNT. BUT THEY'VE BEEN AT THE VERY BOTTOM FOR SO LONG. SO. WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING WE WANT THAT? THE METHODOLOGY HOUSE TO BE IN PLACE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW THEY WERE. WE WE NEED SOMETHING THERE'S MORE THOUGHT FOR MARK MORE COLLABORATIVE. SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO USE THE GOVERNOR'S MONEY. AND THEN WE NEED TO CODIFY IT. OF SO WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE. ON THE APPROACH BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE -- TO ADD TO IT THAT WE'VE OUTLINED ON PAGE. TWENTY SEVEN IN THE AGENDA. SO SIMILAR TO THAT THE THE WHOLE OVER FUNDING THAT WAS PUT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET LAST YEAR THE EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WAS REALLY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE FEDERALLY MATCHED -- YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE S. MAY NEW F. TO EASE THAT WERE AND THE NEED TO BE BROAD ENOUGH THAT MONEY THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THIS MONEY PREDOMINATELY GOES TOWARDS. AND THE INCREASE IN STAFF AND THESE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES THE GOAL IS TO GET THEM TO THAT -- FTE CASELOAD RATIO THAT WE'RE EXPECTING IN THE IN THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY HARD AND FAST TO TO NECESSARILY HOLD THE COUNTY ACCOUNTABLE THEM FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE WE ALLOCATE ACCORDING TO THIS MODEL WE GIVE THE COUNTIES THE MODEL AND THEN THIS IS A STATE RUN LOCALLY OPERATED MODEL THIS LOCAL COUNTY DIRECTORS DO HAVE SOME DISCRETION IN. AND DECISION MAKING AS TO HOW THEY UTILIZE THAT FUNDING. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS FROM STAFF LA -- IS THE NEED TO ADOPT FORMALIZED METHODOLOGY WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE -- RESPONSE TO THAT. SO I AGREE THERE ISN'T NEED TO ADOPT THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY FORMALIZING CODIFYING I WOULD BE HESITANT TO CODIFY THAT NECESSARILY TODAY WE HAVE A PRETTY STRONG A METHODOLOGY THAT'S OUT THERE I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD FEEL ABOUT WHAT THAT IS -- BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD A METHODOLOGY IN CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM IN TWENTY YEARS IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THAT THREE YEARS AND HOW THIS MONEY IS UTILIZED. AND HOW THE METHODOLOGY PLAYS OUT BEFORE YOU OFFICIALLY CODIFIED BUT IF THERE'S LANGUAGE OR SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN THERE THAT THAT MOVES TOWARD CODIFYING THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO DO SO. WELL I I WOULD ASK. THAT THE DEPARTMENT THAT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OUT WORK WITH OUR STAFF TO DEVELOP THAT TRADE A BIT TRAILER BUT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- BUZZ BUDGET A BILL LANGUAGE. IT IS IMPORTANT WE DO NEED TO CODIFY IT -- THERE HAS TO BE A AS WAS AS WAS NOTED BY THE LA -- MORE FORMALIZED METHODOLOGY -- I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU HAVE A FEEL FOR IT. UNFORTUNATELY. OR FORTUNATELY I I DON'T KNOW. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? FINALLY GETTING. OF THE ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT HAS BEEN NEEDED FOR SO LONG. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO HAVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IT AND THAT -- YOU FOR EXPECTING THE COUNTIES TO SPEND IT IN A PARTICULAR WAY. AND THEY HAVE TO REPORT THERE HAS TO BE A THE METHODOLOGY SET IN PLACE AND THAT HAS TO BE FROM THE STATE. WE CAN'T LATER SAY WILL CENTER TO DO YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. THEIR HANDS ARE GOING TO GO UP SO WHAT WERE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WE USE THE MONEY WE DID EVERYTHING THE WAY WE FELT WE SHOULD DO IT. AND THAT WOULD BE TRUE FOR EVERYONE OF THE COUNTIES. I WANT MY COUNTY AND I AND EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS THEIR COUNTY TO RECEIVE THE MONEY THAT IS SO SO NEEDED. I THINK WE WE WOULD ALL AGREE WITH EVERY EVERY COMMENT THAT WAS MADE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE CHILDREN IN DEEP POVERTY. THIS IS MONEY THAT IS NEEDED. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE PRUDENT WITH WITH WHAT WE ASK OF OUR COUNTIES. ONCE THE MONEY IS GIVEN. WE CAN'T GIVE IT AND THEN LATER SAY WHAT DID YOU DO IT DID YOU DO WHAT. AT THE THE METHODOLOGY DOES HAVE TO BE SET UP SO I I WOULD ASK THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT ALL. MEET WITH STAFF TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. TO BE HAPPY TO DO SO. THANK YOU -- I'D I'D ALSO -- ELSE THE TO TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE COLLECTED COLLECTIBILITY STUDIED -- AT YOU'VE ALREADY UNDERTAKEN AT YOU SAY YOU HAVE YOUR A ROUGH DRAFT CAN WE GET MORE DETAILS -- MORE SUBSTANCE -- TIME LINES CAN WE GET THAT BY MAY FIRST. YES AT LEAST A DRAFT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ABSOLUTELY JUST YES YOU'VE GOT UNTIL JULY FIRST BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME LANGUAGE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHERE WE ARE. OKAY AND DISCOVER THAT STILL IMAGES DUE JULY FIRST THERE WAS ANOTHER COMMENT ABOUT EFFECTIVELY STATE IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND THAT FOLKS ARE WANTING US TO REDO BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE THE THE STUDY THAT IS DUE. JULY FIRST YES YOU'VE GOT A ROUGH DRAFT. YES THAT IS WHAT I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO SHARE WITH STAFF. ALL RIGHT AND MAY FIRST. WE WILL DO OUR VERY BEST. I KNOW YOU WILL. AND I APPRECIATE THAT. OUR THIS BILL CHECK MYSELF. CENTER. YES MISTER FRAZIER WE TALK ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY YOU LOOK ON PAGE. TWENTY FIVE TO MY COUNTIES SOLANO IS 3% AUGMENTATION -- AND THEN CONTRA COSTA IS 15% I THINK IT EQUATES TO TWO MILLION. FOR CONTRA COSTA AND IN ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SOLANO COUNTY. WHEN YOU PUT THESE NUMBERS OUT ARE YOU AT? ATTEMPTING TO TALK TO THESE COUNTIES AND SAY LISTEN. I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SKEWED -- CHART HERE. AND THEY SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO WORK FOR THEM. IN OR HOW DO YOU RESPOND. TO POSSIBLY UNDER FUNDING OR HARMING. THE ABILITY TO CARE FOR CHILDREN. THE WAY WE WENT ABOUT A PLEA SURE THE WAY WE WENT ABOUT DOING THE METHODOLOGY WHAT. THIS THE STATE DEPARTMENT DID NOT WANT TO TAKE A POSITION TO SAY THIS IS WHAT THE FUNDING THAT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE DO YOU AGREE OR NOT WITH THE LOCAL CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES THE THIRD THE THE DRIVE FROM US WAS TO ENGAGE THE TRUCKS WERE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. HAVE THEM REALLY WORK ON AND THE THE STUDY TO SEE HOW MUCH TIME AND ENERGY IT TAKES TO WORK CASES AND HAVE THEM WORK ON THAT PROPOSED METHODOLOGY COME TO AGREEMENT FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE ON THE KIND OF THE CORE OUT LIKE. IN IN IN AGREE TO THAT WITH US SO WE'VE ALREADY GOT THERE BY IN ON THE FUNDING MYTHOLOGY BECAUSE THEY WERE ONE OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS FOR DEVELOPING. RIGHT IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THE LAMAR. AND I THINK THAT WE I'M SORRY. I WAS GOING. BUT THAT WELL MISTER FRAZIER WOULD YOU LOOK AT PAGE TWENTY THREE BECAUSE THAT THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME. WHICH WHICH WHICH COUNTY DO WE SEE AT THE VERY BOTTOM. WAIT A MINUTE AND NOW WE HAVE A NEW CHAIR. NO. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS ANY HELP. THEN IT HELPS I JUST LIVE NO THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE LARGEST COUNTY AND YOU SEE THEY ARE DEAD LAST. I I DO APPRECIATE THAT LONG BEFORE I WAS APPOINTED TO THIS POSITION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE INDEPENDENTLY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO WITH THE CHILDREN WHO ARE IN DEEP POVERTY. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP AND BY THIS THE GOVERNOR THEN PROPOSING -- TO TO ADD THE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. BUT ALSO MENTION IN THE SPRING TWO YEARS AGO WE WERE WORKING ON A METHODOLOGY THE RATIO IS ACTUALLY HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR CASES PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. AFTER THE STUDY DONE BY THE COUNTIES THEY CAME BACK AND AGREED THAT IT WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT CASES CRAFTY SO EVEN THROUGH THEIR ANALYSIS THE RATIO IS ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN IT WAS INITIALLY -- KIND OF BRINGING DOWN THE OVERALL ASK THAT WERE HERE. TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT TODAY. IN ONE LAST QUESTION. OF I WANT TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE ON INCREASING THE PASSED THROUGH TO THE FEDERALLY ALLOWABLE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SYSTEMS -- A TO FAMILIES SO THERE'S ACTUALLY A A BILL WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH RIGHT NOW ON ON THE PASSED THROUGH WE'VE HAD A PRETTY TIGHT -- CONTROL ON THAT HERE IT HAS BEEN FIFTY DOLLARS DISREGARD IS PASSED THE FAMILY THE BALANCES RECOUP TEN RETURN TO THE STATE SO -- FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I'M I'M REALLY LOOKING TO THE STATE AS A WHOLE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AN INNOCENTLY INCIDENT AS OUR CLIENTS HOW MUCH CHILD SUPPORT YOU WANTS TO COLLECT ON BEHALF THE STATE AND HOW MUCH OF IT WOULD YOU PREFER THAT WE PASSED TO THE FAMILIES AND SO. AM WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS AT THIS POINT WE'RE PRETTY NEUTRAL ON WHERE THIS NEEDS TO GO WE'RE GIVING TECHNICAL ADVICE ON THE IMPACTS OF THAT DECISION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. SO AS OF NOW THE THE ADMINISTRATION IS NEUTRAL ON THIS YES. OKAY WHEN A TAPE POSITION AT THIS TIME. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. AND I I THINK YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT. THE LAST WORD DECEMBER TODAY NO I'M GOOD I'M GOOD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING ON AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO TO ALL OF OUR COUNTIES -- WHERE THERE WERE GETTING A SMALL AMOUNT OR A LARGE AMUNT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TRY TO HELP THESE CHILDREN? IN THE END SO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ISSUE FOR ADVOCACY PROPOSALS FOR CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. YEAH. WE HAVE JAMIE AUSTIN SENIOR DIRECTOR INSIDE AND ANALYTICS TIPPING POINT. REPLACING JESSICA [inaudible] RIGHT YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JAMIE AUSTIN HERE DIRECTOR TO BE POINT COMMUNITY. GRANT MAKING ORGANIZATION TO FIGHT POVERTY THE BAY AREA. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO THE POINT IS RAISE MORE THAN TWO AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BEST PARTY FIGHTING. NONPROFITS TO EDUCATE EMPLOY HOUSE AND SUPPORT THOSE IN NEED. OUR LAST MONTH TIPPING POINT COOPER THE PAY BACK PROBLEM THAT DISCUSSES HOW EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY TO NOT RECEIVE ALL OF THEIR CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. MADE BY THEIR PARENTS. INSTEAD MOST OF THEIR PARENTS CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS ARE INTERCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY BACK THE COST OF TEN F.. MEDI CAL AND OTHER FORMS OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND NOT TO THEIR CHILDREN. TIPPING POINT ON BEHALF OF THE INSIGHT CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY LINK THE SAM'S IS GOV FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT. AND WESTERN CENTER AMMAN PARTY -- IS HERE DISCUSS THIS REQUEST FOR INCREASED BUDGET BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE COLLECTION STRATEGIES SHOULD BE TIED TO THIS ASK. ON THE FIRST OF THE ADVOCATES REQUESTS. ARE WE'RE DROPPING A REQUEST FOR THE COLLECTIBILITY STUDY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY COMMITTED TO DOING THIS. AND THE SECOND REQUEST DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSIONS WE BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION SINCE THE SENATE HEARING ON THIS ISSUE. BUT TO REVIEW WHEN NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS CANNOT REPAY THE COST OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND FALL MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS BEHIND THE PROCESS FOR SUSPENDING DRIVER'S LICENSES BEGINS. AND THE SUSPENSION OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL LICENSES WORKS SIMILARLY. THESE POLICIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT LOW INCOME FAMILIES OF COLOR IS NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO. AND BY OUR ESTIMATE A MAJORITY OF THEM MAKE LESS THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THESE PENALTIES ARE AND JUST KIND OF PRODUCTIVE AND UNDERMINED FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST STRINGENT POLICIES REGARDING DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSIONS. WHEN PARENTS LOSE A LICENSES THEY CANNOT DRIVE TO WORK AND THAT'S REDUCING A MEANS TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT? CALIFORNIA ELIMINATED DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION FOR FAILING TO PAY TRAFFIC COURT THAT THAT MAINTAINS A STRINGENT POLICY FOR CHILD SUPPORT DEBT. WE UNDERSTAND IS LOTS OF WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS ISSUE. ON THE THIRD REQUEST INCARCERATION. I WENT EVEN WHEN DEBT IS OWED TO THE GOVERNMENTS TO REPAY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. THE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES CAN INCARCERATE FOR FAILURE TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT THAT. THE NUMBERS MAY BE SMALL. WHEN PARENTS ARE INCARCERATED THEIR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PAID BACK GROWS EXPONENTIALLY AS THE INTEREST RATE ON THIS DEBT IS THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRE THAT A PARENT IS PROVEN TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY THEIR SUPPORT OWED BEFORE THE COURT CAN ISSUE A CONTEMPT ORDER. ONE COURSE RATE AND A CURSORY APPARENT FOR NON PAYMENT. THIS WILL NOT ONLY PREVENT PARENTS FROM BEING INCARCERATED DUE TO POVERTY. WILL ALSO BRING CALIFORNIA IN ALIGNMENT WITH FEDERAL LAW. AS REQUIRED BY THE OBAMACARE A FINAL RULE AND THE SUPREME COURT CASE TURNER VERSES ROGERS. MARCH ROBIN WITH THE PARENTS -- DRIVEN DEEPER INTO POVERTY IN THE HIGHER LEVELS OF THAT THE DRIVERS LICENSE SUSPENSIONS AND INCARCERATION SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO KEEP UP WITH OUR PAYMENTS. TO SPENDING DRIVERS THE VESSEL IN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE AND PARTICULAR CAN KERR SERRATION FOR EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF TRANSPORT THAT ISN'T I'M JUST PRACTICE. IN SERVE ONLY TO REDUCE APPARENT ABILITY TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN FAMILIES. WE SUPPORT THE TRAILER BILL TO AND INEFFICIENT AND HARMFUL PRACTICES WE WOULD APPRECIATE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS -- ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. YOU KNOW AND THIS. ONE WHICH WAS OFF ON A FINANCE WANTING POSITION AT THIS TIME I JUST ALSO RECEIVE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SO WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH IT [inaudible] THANK YOU -- DAVID OVER AGAIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE ALSO JUST RECEIVED THE TRAILING REGION HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH IT AND HAVE SOME ANALYSIS. ON THIS BASED OFF LAST TIME BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A POSITION ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. I THINK -- THAT THE FIRST POINT THAT HE MENTIONED ABOUT THE THIS THE STUDY BEING DONE COLLECTIVELY STUDY THAT WAS THE OTHER STUDY I WAS REFERRING TO EARLIER. THAT WAS DONE IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND TALKS ABOUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY CLICKED ON CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM SO WE HAVE INITIATED IN. A STATEMENT WORKING OR GOING OUT TO BID TO HAVE THAT STUDY UPDATED AND FOR A CALIFORNIA TO TO REALLY SEE HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT OUR PROGRAM -- I DO HAVE MORE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DRIVER'S LICENSE LANGUAGE IN THERE AND THAT WE HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH HOW WE WOULD IMPLEMENT THAT TEN AND ITS EFFECT WHILE I AGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF OF A DISPROPORTIONATE VICTIM POVERTY I THINK THE WAY THAT THAT'S WHERE THE WRITTEN HERE MIGHT. BE CHALLENGING FOR US. AS TO THEIR INCARCERATION PIECE ON ON ON CONTEMPT. THERE'S ALREADY THE FINAL RULE THAT WILL WORK IN IMPLEMENTING A PEACE THAT FINAL RULES ABOUT REDUCING. THE CONTENT PROCESS WE CURRENTLY HAVE A GRANT GOING ON IN SAN BERNARDINO RIVERSIDE. NINETY TWO REVIEW THIS AND TRYING TO SEE IF THERE ARE -- PROCEDURAL. ALTERNATIVES TO THE CONTEMPT PROCESS AND SO THAT'S BEEN A THREE YEAR STUDY. WELL ACTUALLY IT'S FIVE OR STUDY BUT THREE YEARS AT THAT THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF ACTUALLY TESTING THESE RESULTS ON WE'RE ANTICIPATING SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM THOSE. COMPANY OVERALL EXPECTATION THE FINAL RULE IS ACTUALLY TO DECREASE -- DAY THE CONTEMPT PROCESS AND CERTAINLY NOT PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL AS REQUESTED. BUT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT -- NEXT WITNESS. HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT LEGISLATURE DID STAFF MANY [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LET'S OPEN THIS UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA BARTLETT WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI SABRINA HAMMER THE CALIFORNIA AT THE BUILDING COALITION -- WE SUPPORT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO HELP LOW INCOME PEOPLE GET OUT OF POVERTY YOUR STRONG SUPPORT OF A CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT SYSTEM 1100% OF PAYMENTS GO DIRECTLY TO CHILDREN. NOT -- RECOUPED BY BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE STRONG SUPPORT OF NOT UNDERMINING ANY -- NOT THE TOTAL PARENTS ABILITY TO REAP TO PAY THOSE PAYMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. IF ANYONE WITH THE CSU CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN WORKERS AND WE CAN COUNTY THE BOARD THE COUNTY SAN JOAQUIN DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE HOWEVER. AS A CHILD FOR PROFESSIONAL OF TWENTY NINE YEARS I WOULD SAY THAT THESE PROPOSALS ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE CHILD FOR AGENCIES. AND THEY ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE COST TO PARENTS WHO WOULD REAP OUR COLLECTION EFFORTS. THE DRIVER'S LICENSE. REMEDY RIGHT NOW ALLOWS A LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY. TO SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR SOMEONE WHO IS FAILED TO PAY HIS OR HER CHILD SUPPORT. IF WE WERE TO HAVE TO GO TO COURT THAT WOULD. BE DELAYED THE TIME FOR US TO THAT COLLECTION AND GET THAT MONEY TO THE FAMILIES SO I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE EFFECT. ON THE CHILDREN FAMILIES WE SERVE [inaudible] THANK YOU. HELLO ARE ONCE AGAIN GREG WILSON WITH THE CHARLES WHAT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THAT ORGANIZATION WE ALSO AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD JUST RECEIVED -- NOT LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO COPY OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH ANALYZING -- THE DETAILS OF THAT IS QUITE EXTENSIVE IT'S TWENTY PAGES LONG IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME WE DO SEE SOME INITIAL CHALLENGES -- AND WE ARE MUCH MORE WE ARE VERY WILLING TO WORK WITH -- THE COALITION TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE LANGUAGE -- THAT IS BENEFICIAL FOR IT NOT ONLY THE FAMILIES BUT ALSO THE STATE -- AND THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS SO -- WE OFFER OUR SUPPORT -- BUT WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THIS ITEM AT THE MOMENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME'S ANTHONY ROBLES THAT THE YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION IN LA AND THAT SOMEBODY HAS BEEN PERSONALLY IMPACTED BY. CURRENT CHILD SUPPORT POLICIES ON MY FATHER WAS INCARCERATED AND ON WHEN HE GOT OUT YOU KNOW HE ACCRUED ALL KIND THE CHILD SUPPORT THAT. HE OVER HAPPY CHECK WITH CARNAGE TWENTY FIRST CAME ON A STARTED WORKING AND NONE OF THAT MONEY OR VERY LITTLE OF THAT MONEY EVER GOT BACK TO US -- SO AS SOMEBODY THAT'S BEEN IMPACTED THAT WE HAVEN'T SUPPORT ANY ALL GOOD CHILD SUPPORT POLICIES ON PHONE SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU. TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MANAGER. SO. I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE. AT A COMPOUNDS IN AND CREATES MORE. BAD THAN GOOD -- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- REVOKING A DRIVER'S LICENSE IN. A LOT OF THE SITUATIONS. SO WHERE IS THE DETERRENT EFFECTS TAKEN AWAY. I THINK I'D BE A BIT OF THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINE I THINK IN THIS INCIDENT YOU'RE MAKING THE SUGGESTION I MAKE THIS. SO YOU NEED TO BRING THE SOLUTION ALL THEY ALL CALL TURN OF ALSO. I MEAN YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE. IF YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ONE ALTERNATIVE YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE. THE OTHER SAID DON'T LEAVE IT TO THEM. YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO BE SUPPORTED THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE OR WORDS THE DETERRENT -- AND I AGREE WITH YOU. BUT JUST DON'T HANDED OFF AND SAY WE WANT THIS AND THEN. BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION WHAT WILL BE THE DETERRENT. I BECAUSE AS IT THE OTHERS WHO HAVE STATED. IN ARMS THE CHILDREN. SO HERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE HAVE [inaudible] A REASON. TO NOT SKIP OUT. AND KNOWING THAT THAT NOW IF WE TAKE THAT AWAY. WHAT'S THE DETERRENT SITE YOU KNOW DEPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THE AGENCY -- TO CREATE THE POSSIBILITY. OF BECAUSE IF NOT. THERE'S NO OTHER ALL DETERRENT. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED ALTHOUGH TO KEEP IT. YEAH I WOULD I WOULD. AGREE WITH -- MISTER FRASIER'S COMMENTS THAT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO US IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT YOU DON'T WANT. BUT IT'S NOT OBVIOUS WHAT YOU DO AND SO. YOU KNOW IT ISN'T REALLY I MEAN WILL WILL REACT TO WHAT YOU BRING FORWARD AS AS ADVOCATES AND AGREE THERE'S A WEEK WE THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND WE DO WE DO BUT WE DON'T DON'T WANT TO SEE CHILDREN HARM. BUT I DO TO HAVE A CONCERN THAT WITH WITH THERE'S NO DETERRENT THAN. HOW DOES HOW DOES HOW DOES THIS ULTIMATELY WORK OUT FOR THE KIDS? THIS IS A KIND OF A LOT TO WORTH IT BUT DEPARTMENT ON THIS I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO PICK THANK YOU. THANK YOU BYE I DO WANT TO ASK THE DIRECTOR -- HOW WIDESPREAD THE PENAL CODE VIOLATION OF CONTEMPT? ARE USED AS TOOLS CONTENT. THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTENT THERE'S A CRIMINAL CONTEMPT IN A CIVIL CONTEMPT CRIMINAL CONTEMPT IS A VERY COSTLY PROGRAMMING HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY COMPLETELY ELIMINATE ACROSS ALL THE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE IDEA OF GOING AFTER AND CREATING SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL VIOLATION IN THE PUTTING SOMEONE IN JAIL BECAUSE OF CHILD SUPPORT IS CLEARLY NOT GOING TO IMPROVE THE BENEFIT. AND TO THE CHILD THAT THE PERSON NEEDS TO BE OUT NEED BE WORKING THE CIVIL CONTEMPT IS A PROCESS THAT WE USE -- PRIMARILY AS A TOOL TO GET SOMEONE INTO OUR OFFICE AND ENGAGE WITH THAT AS LONG AS THEY'RE ENGAGING WITH US WE DON'T MOVE. THE FOLKS AT IGNORE US THAT TENDS TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS AND I DON'T THINK THAT. AND THE FINAL CONTEMPT RESULT ACTUALLY HELPS THEM IT PROBABLY HURTS THEM MORE FROM GETTING THEIR JOB BUT LACKING THE DRIVER'S LICENSE OR CONTEMPT ACTION TO SPUR SOMEBODY TO ENGAGE WITH US. WE DO STRUGGLE WITH GETTING SOMEONE. TO OPEN THEIR MAIL OR CALL US SOARING ENGAGE WITH US IN ANY SORT OF HUESO. AND THAT'S WHAT THE CONTENT PROCESSES USED -- FOR I CAN'T THINK OF A TIME WHEN WE PUT SOMEONE IN JAIL BECAUSE OF CHILD SUPPORT STILLER CRIMINAL I'D HAVE TO GO BACK. A LONG WAYS TO FIND ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES AND BUT THERE ARE INCIDENCES AND HE'S SPEAKING MORE TO FOLKS THAT ARE IN POVERTY AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THE CONTEMPT PROCESS ITSELF IS MOST BENEFICIAL WHEN WE ACTIVELY KNOW SOMEONE IS HIDING FROM US OR ATTEMPTING TO AVOID US AND THAT. IS OUR ONE OF OUR STRONGEST REMEDIES TO REALLY GET THE COR INVOLVED AND MAKE SOMEONE PAY WHO HAS THE KEPT CAPABILITY AND THE CAPACITY TO PAY BUT IS JUST ACTIVELY CHOOSING NOT. TO YES MOST FRESH. IS THERE A NUMBER THAT YOU HAVE. THAT IS COLLECTIBLE RIGHT NOW. TO ALL OF THE FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED. WELL THE ARREARS BALANCE IN CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ARREARS DO. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS INTEREST? A BIG PORTION OF THAT IS INTERESTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF ABOUT NINE MILLION OR EIGHT MILLION IN PRINCIPLE ON THE BALANCE IN INTEREST. BUT OKAY THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE I'M GOING OFF TOP OF MY HEAD. IS THERE EVER BEEN A PROGRAM THAT WOULD WAIVE THE WILL INTEREST IF IT WAS A MADE. OF THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT WAVE THE INTEREST TO AND THE CHANCE FOR PROGRAM THE ONLY COLLECT PRINCIPLE THERE ARE STATES THAT HAVE A 0% INTEREST RATE 3% INTEREST RATE CALIFORNIA IS SET AT TEN AND THAT'S THAT ACROSS ALL OF THE JUDICIAL MATTERS SO IT'S NOT JUST OUR INTEREST. RATE BUT IT CAN BE CARVED OUT IF IF THE RULING WHICH TO DO THAT AND THERE ARE ACTUAL PROPOSALS THEY'RE GOING TO THE AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS RIGHT NOW THAT SPEAKING TO INTEREST RATES MAYBE 10% IS NOT THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR AND I KNOW THE DMV DOES THOSE -- CRASH. WHERE THE WIPEOUT? AMNESTY PROGRAM THANK YOU FOR THE WORD YOU KNOW. WE WILL WAIVE THE INTEREST IF YOU IF YOU CATCH UP. HAS THAT EVER BEEN DONE SO WE DO HAVE A CO PROGRAM THAT IS AMNESTY AND USUALLY IF SOMEONE IS PAYING 10% OF WHAT'S OUT NOW THIS IS SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNMENT WE DON'T WAVE -- MOTHERS ARE STILL DEPARTMENT JUST THE FOR THE GOVERNMENT -- USUALLY IF SOMEONE IS PAYING TO PAY A LUMP SUM OF THEY PAY OVERTIME WILL WIPE UP 290% OF THE DEBT OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT -- FOR FOLKS THAT ARE TRYING TO GET BACK ON TOP OF THEIR LIFE AND AM IN WILLING TO PAY SO WE DO HAVE THAT PROCESS THERE. AND THEN WE HAVE THE PROPOSAL'S GOING TO TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT AND WHETHER WERE WILLING TO WAIVE FOR WIPE THAT OUT TO CLOSE THE CASE IN ENTIRETY. AND THAT'S PART OF THE FINAL RULE AND IT'S PART OF THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE WORKING THE WAY TO THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. SO IS IT SOMETHING THAT -- CALIFORNIA CAN ADOPT. FOR INSTANCE A ONE OR TWO YEAR AMNESTY PROGRAM. TO COLLECT. THE ARREARS. I'M NOT SURE ADDRESSING. IF THE THE THE CHILD SUPPORT THAT IS OWED ON THE BOOKS. IS. WHAT DID YOU SAVE OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION? AND THEN THE REST WAS ALL INTEREST YEAH THERE'S SAID ABOUT A BILLION -- TO ODIN PRINCIPAL AND THEN THE THE BALANCES OWED AN INTEREST -- IN NOW THAT'S THE GRAND TOTAL THERE'S A SMALLER PORTION IT'S OWED SPECIFICALLY TO THE STATE AND PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WHICH IS A BIG TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS WORK IN A WAY THROUGH. AND THAT'S REALLY FROM THE STATE'S TOLERANCE LEVEL AS TO HOW MUCH WE'RE WILLING TO WAVER FORGIVE THROUGH THAT PROCESS. I HAVE A QUESTION THAT YOU NEW YORK HAS A NEW PROPOSAL NEW PROGRAM -- PROPERTY PROGRAMMER ORDER ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH IT. NOW I WAS GETTING AT QUICK LOS ANGELES YEAH. IN THAT WE CAN SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD RECENTLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT NEW YORK STATE IS DONE RECENTLY TO ADDRESS THE HUGE ON BURGEONING ARREARS PROBLEM. THEY HAVE A POVERTY LEVEL ORDER AND A MINIMUM ORDER THE POVERTY LEVEL ORDER IS SET WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL. FOR INSTANCE IN A STUDY APPARENT HIS INCOME IS BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THE COURT THEN ESTABLISHES THE ORDER TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. HAS MULTIPLE USES AND BENEFITS ONE IS A GETS THE KNOX SO THE APPARENT CONNECTED. TO THE CUSTODIAL PARENT AND THE CHILD BECAUSE THEY SEE THE PAYMENTS ARE BEING MADE. AS OPPOSED TO A ZERO ORDER OR IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO ASSUME IF WE HAVE NO WARNINGS HISTORY. THAT THE PARENT IS WORKING FULL TIME AT MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT'S PUT INTO OUR CALCULATOR THEY END UP WITH AN ORDER THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS AND THEY CAN'T PAY WHY NOT GIVE THEM IN ORDER THAT THEY CAN PAY. IT THROUGH THE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY POVERTY LEVEL TO GET THEM STARTED WE CAN ALWAYS INCREASE IT IF THEY BECOME EMPLOYED. THEN THE OTHER FIFTY DOLLAR ORDER IN NEW YORK HAS TO DO WITH SOMEONE BEING BELOW 2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL I THINK THERE'S A LOT THERE WHAT THEY'RE DOING THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANKS [inaudible] THANK YOU. IN GOING BACK TO TO SOME OF THE TOOLS ARE USED. DO. DO THE PRACTICES WHETHER WERE USING THE PENAL CODE OR THE DRIVER'S LICENSE. DO THESE PRACTICES IMPROVE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO DETERMINE WHETHER. THE FAMILY THE MOM AND DAD ARE ACTUALLY TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND NOT TO OR WHETHER CHILD SUPPORT IS THE IS THE THING THAT'S BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AT THE THING THAT'S KEEPING THEM APART -- I THINK IT'S HAPPENING BOTH WAYS RIGHT NOW -- BECAUSE WE'RE WE HAVE THAT CHILD SUPPORT ORDER RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING SO THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW WELL WE ARE CREATING AN ENGAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE PER SE OR A SEPARATION BECAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING A PERSON PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT AND THEY MIGHT BE UPSET ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE FACT THAT TWO THIRDS. OF NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS THAT ARE IN ARREARS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO -- IT THEY ARE ALSO -- AT BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO COLLECT THE CHILD SUPPORT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RULES AND HOW THEY AFFECT THOSE WHO CAN LEAST. AFFORD TO HAVE. HAVE THE RULES SET IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT JUST PUTS THEM FURTHER AND FURTHER NOT ONLY FOR THE FURTHER INTO POVERTY. BUT ALSO FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO THE SHADOWS. AND THEN THAT WORKS JUST EXACTLY AGAINST FAMILY ENGAGEMENT WHICH BECOMES A SERIOUSPROBLEM I THINK NEW YORK MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING -- MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT BUT I SINCERELY APPRECIATE -- THE THE THE PRESENTATION THE PROPOSAL ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND BEFORE WE CONCLUDE I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP A TO PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ANY OF THE NON DISCUSSION ISSUES IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE -- TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] SEEING NONE. THIS COMMITTEE IS ADJOURNED
