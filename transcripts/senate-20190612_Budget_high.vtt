NINETY EIGHT SAID ABOUT FUNDING

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:49.295
THIS IS FUNDING OWED UNDER

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.863
PROPOSITION I HIGHER FISCAL

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.568
A SECOND HIGHLIGHT OF THIS BILL

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.837
IS A CHANGE TO THE PROPOSITION

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.472
NINETY CERTIFICATION PROCESS.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.907

CANNOT GO DOWN AND IT ALSO

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:13.720
ELIMINATES THAT COT ALLOCATION

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.688
SCHEDULE THAT WAS CREATED IN THE

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:16.889
PREVIOUS BUDGET ACT THAT

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.524
PREVIOUSLY WOULD USE ACCESS

PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.060

CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED UNDER

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.741
LAW -- BUT WHEN COAL -- FOR LCF

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.009
EXCEEDS THE OVERALL GROWTH IN

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.710
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THERE

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:38.878
WOULD BE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THAT

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:45.318
CALL LEVEL UNDER THIS BILL SO

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:45.885
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST.

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:54.093
WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.895
ELABORATION AS TO THE

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.997
PROHIBITION OF OF NO DOWNWARD

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.932
ADJUSTMENTS FOR PROP NINETY

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.901
EIGHT IN THE FUTURE WE KIND OF

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:02.769
INCOME BRING [inaudible]

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:05.471
FUTURE.

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:06.873
PLAYED.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.275
LAKE JURORS -- IN AN ECONOMIC

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:10.209
DOWNTURN IN.

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.110
WHAT KIND OF IMPACT WOULD THAT

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:12.812
HAVE ON THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.347
IN THE GENERAL FUND WERE PAYING?

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:17.116
FOR SCHOOL BOND PAYMENTS.

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:18.718
SO IT WOULD PROBABLY PUT AN EVER

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.486
MORE STRESS I WOULD THINK ON THE

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:21.054
GENERAL FUND SO I'M I'M JUST

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.622
TRYING.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.223
TO UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.925
SO I'LL MAKE A COUPLE POINTS IN

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:26.459
AND JUST GIVE MY TEAM CAN

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.794
ELABORATE AS WELL I THINK THE

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.562
FIRST THING IN TERMS OF GENERAL

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.730
ENCUMBRANCE ON FUTURE.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.466
LEGISLATURE'S ALL OF THIS IS IN

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.935
STATUTES SO -- SO ANYTHING --

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:36.703
FUTURE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE ANY

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.939
ACTION ON ANY OF THE ITEMS IN

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:40.673
THIS BILL OR IN CURRENT LAW.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.009
IN THE PAST YES -- AND SO AND SO

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.644
THAT'S THE FIRST BROADER POINT --

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.012
I THINK SECOND -- WELL -- THE

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.979
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.948
ADMINISTRATION REALIZES FOR

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.349
SCHOOLS IT CAN BE VERY TOUGH

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:51.751
WHEN THEY'VE GONE THROUGH A

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:52.685
FISCAL YEAR THEY BELIEVE THAT

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.954
THIS IS THE MONEY THAT THEY ARE

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.522
ENTITLED TO UNDER PROPOSITION.

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:57.490
NINETY EIGHT AND THEN AFTER THAT

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:58.825
YEAR IS OVER -- IT ACTUALLY

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.593
TURNS OUT UNDER PROPOSITION

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.227
NINETY EIGHT THEY WERE SUPPOSED

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:02.495
TO SPEND LESS THAN THAT AND AND

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:04.263
THAT CHANGES WHAT THEY GET IN

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.264
FUTURE YEARS EVEN THOUGH THAT IS

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.866
THE GUARANTEE WHAT THEY'RE

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:07.667
SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE IN FUTURE

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:08.067
YEARS.

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:10.069
SO WE SEE THIS AS GIVING SCHOOLS

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:11.738
MUCH MORE PREDICTABILITY -- THAT

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.573
WE SHOULD HAVE UNDER PROPOSITION

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.440
NINETY EIGHT WE ALL KNOW IT'S A

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:16.876
VERY COMPLICATED FORMULA BUT

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.278
ONCE THE FISCAL YEAR IS OVER WE

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:21.681
BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL OF THAT

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:22.348
SHOULD BE WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED.

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:22.982
TO AND THEN THE LAST THING IN

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.917
TERMS OF FISCAL PRESSURE THAT

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:26.319
YOU MENTION SENATOR MORE LOCK --

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:28.354
THE LAST CHANGE THAT I MENTIONED

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.756
IN TERMS OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:30.490
COAL LOT.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:31.824
THAT'S DESIGNED TO ADDRESS IN

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:32.825
MANY WAYS THE CONCERN THAT YOU

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:33.993
RAISED IN THAT WHAT IF YOU HAVE

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.362
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THAT'S

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:37.430
GROWING AT A LEVEL THAT'S MAYBE

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:38.965
LESS THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:40.199
AND YET THE COLA THAT WE HAVE IN

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:41.534
STATUTE WHICH IS CONTINUOUSLY

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.903
APPROPRIATED IS MUCH HIGHER.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.404
THAN WE MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.540
WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OR

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:48.975
EIGHT MY CROWD OUT YOU KNOW THE

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.576
LCS OUT FUNDING MY CRIED OUT

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:51.377
OTHER PROGRAMS WITHIN THE

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:52.011
GUARANTEE AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.045
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOME OF

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:53.946
THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS IN

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:54.814
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IN BUDGET

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.315
COMMITTEE WHETHER IT'S SPECIAL

OR AFTER SCHOOL FUNDING OR OTHER

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.987
PROGRAMS SO THIS CHANGE IT

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:02.622
REDUCES THAT PRESSURE BY

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.957
ALIGNING THE COLA WITH GROWTH IN

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:05.892
THE GUARANTEE IF THE GROWTH IN

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:12.999
THE GUARANTEES LOWER THAN

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.767
ANTICIPATED.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.836
THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

THIS.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:24.477
THIS ISSUE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:25.411
BUT MAYBE NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE ME

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:26.445
A NO VOTE ON IT BUT IT DOES

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:28.681
CONCERN ME THE I DON'T KNOW I

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:29.615

SO I'LL MAKE ONE POINT AND THEN

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:41.694
A JESSICA CAN ELABORATE I THINK

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:42.295
THE MAIN THING HERE IS THAT.

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:42.728
BY OFFERING GREATER

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:43.529
PREDICTABILITY AND CERTAINTY FOR

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.498
PRIOR YEAR APPROPRIATIONS.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.266
GIVE THOSE SCHOOLS MORE

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:50.136
STABILITY US TODAY AT THE TIME

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:50.636
IF THEIR ENROLLMENTS ARE

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.004
DECLINING.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.639
THEY'RE NOT ALREADY ALLOW

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:54.907
ALREADY TO DEALING WITH THAT

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.242
THEY'RE NOT ALSO DEALING WITH

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.143
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GUARANTEE.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.945
AND THE OVERALL POINT THOUGH IS

00:07:59.011 --> 00:07:59.946
THAT WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENT --

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.180

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:18.898
ON THE THE TEST ONE TEST TO TEST

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.032
THREE THATWE FIND THAT ARE ADA

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.834
DRIVEN SO CURRENTLY BECAUSE WE

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.269

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.905
ENVIRONMENT WE ARE IN A TEST.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:26.906
ONE AND THAT ENSURES THAT EVEN

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:27.206
IF.

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:29.242
THE ADA DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:30.543
WE'RE STILL RECEIVING THAT

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.845

WAS HIGHER TO MAINTAIN FUNDING --

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:57.603
IN THEIR CURRENT YEAR SO THERE

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.237

OPTICS.

00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:31.824

FOR HAVING NEW JUDGESHIPS

UNDER STRESS SO THIS IS INVOLVED

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:11.462

FOR GREATER PART OF A DECADE IN

00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:02.339
JUST WANTED TO BE A CIVIC CENTER

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:04.041

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:05.042
TO BE DETERMINED HERE IN THE

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:06.076
COMING WEEKS AND I THINK IT'S

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.177
IMPORTANT WE START HAVING THAT

00:44:07.244 --> 00:44:08.278
CONVERSATION NOW ON THIS

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:15.853
WITH YOU MORE. THIRTY NIELSEN.

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:17.988
WELL I WILL REITERATE MY

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:19.456
COLLEAGUE DID THAT THIS IS BEEN

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:21.492
AROUND A LONG.

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:22.960
AND IT'S BEEN.

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.328
THE FRUSTRATING AND THE MANNER

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:25.496
IN WHICH IT IS BEEN PURSUIT.

00:44:25.562 --> 00:44:27.164
AND I THINK IN NO SMALL MEASURE

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:27.965
BY THE MANNER WHICH HAVE BEEN

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:28.866
PURSUED HAS BEEN REJECTED.

00:44:28.932 --> 00:44:31.802
UNTIL NOW.

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:33.303
AND NOW I AM CONCERNED.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:35.339
THOUGH BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:37.775
IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT TO

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:39.410
IT'S PRETTY TOUGH FOR ME TO SAY

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.377
NO.

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.579
BUT I THINK THAT THIS A LITTLE

00:44:42.646 --> 00:44:43.914
BIT AGREED HERE.

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.883
WHEN THIS IS ALLOWING AN AGENCY

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:49.653
OF GOVERNMENT? TO CYCLE UP TO IS

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.089
MUCH IS EIGHTY CENTS.

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:55.125
RAISING THE NINE ONE ONE IF YOU

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:56.727

00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:17.848
