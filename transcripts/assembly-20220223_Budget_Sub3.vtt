00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:26.671
THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE OF THIS

00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:28.473
PLAN ISSUED- BASICALLY TAKES

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.207
INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE'VE HAD

00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:31.609
SOME- MORE ROBUST ON A RECENT

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:33.611
CAP AND TRADE AUCTIONS. AND

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:34.946
PROJECT THAT THOSE HIGHER

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:37.148
REVENUES COULD INCREASE IT HAD A

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:42.821
SCENARIO WHERE THOSE- THOSE

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:45.190
CONTINUE TO TWENTY THIRTY. I'M

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.458
THIRTY THREE. THAT THIS MONEY

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:47.592
WILL BE RUN FIFTY TECH. THE COST

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:51.362
THE WRIST TO BAKER. THANK I'M

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:52.831
KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T FUNDING

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:56.000
SOURCES FOR THE REMAIN OF ONE.

00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:57.635
I'M AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

00:28:57.702 --> 00:28:58.837
THIRTEEN THAT WE IDENTIFY FOUR

00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.572
KEY ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:03.675
CONSIDERATION- SO FIRST WE KNOW

00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:05.510
THAT THERE'S BEEN A RECENT

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:07.545
AGREEMENT- BUT THE AUTHORITY HAS

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:08.947
ENTERED INTO. A REALLY

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:10.348
COMPLICATED LEGISLATIVE DECISION

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:13.384
MAKING SO SPECIFICALLY IN JUNE

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:14.185
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE AUTHORITY

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:15.920
ENTERED INTO A REVISED AGREEMENT

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:16.821
WITH THE FEDERAL WORRY GOT GOT

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:18.423
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXCUSE ME AS

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:19.924
PART OF THE SETTLEMENT- A

00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:21.860
SIMPLIFICATION RELATED TO THE FY

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:23.728
TEN FEDERAL GRANTS. AND UNLIKE

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.330
PRIOR AGREEMENTS THAT THE THAT

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:27.065
WE HAD ENTERED INTO THIS ONE

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:27.966
SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:29.400
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE CENTRAL

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:31.336
VALLEY SEGMENT AS A TASK THAT

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:32.370
WILL BE COMPLETED BUT THE GRANT

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.139
FUNDS. SO BASICALLY THAT

00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:35.340
CONNECTS THE TWO ELECTRIFYING

00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:36.908
THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT

00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:38.276
UNLESS IT'S ABLE TO RENEGOTIATE

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:39.210
THE AGREEMENT THE FEDERAL

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:42.814
GOVERNMENT. ARE POTENTIALLY PUT

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:44.249
THOSE FUNDS AT RISK. I'M WE DO

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:45.517
KNOW IN A LIKE. ONE HUNDRED NINE

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:47.619
MILES. I'M PROUD WOULDN'T BE

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:48.686
WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IS

00:29:48.753 --> 00:29:49.854
PROBABLY IMPRACTICAL TO RUN AN

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:52.157
ELECTRIFIED SERVICE ON- AND I

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:54.459
THINK MADE BETWEEN. AND CHAPTER

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:55.760
I'M SO SHOULD THE AUTHORITY

00:29:55.827 --> 00:29:56.528
ELECTRIFY THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:58.163
SEGMENT WE THINK IT MIGHT. MIGHT

00:29:58.229 --> 00:30:00.331
MAKE SENSE TO EXTEND THAT TO

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:00.932
MORE LOGICAL CONNECTION POINT

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:03.434
SUCH AS MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD-

00:30:03.501 --> 00:30:04.469
AND CERTAINLY THE UTILITY OF

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:05.870
THAT STATEMENT WOULD DEPEND A

00:30:05.937 --> 00:30:07.939
LOT ON HOW WELL. WE'RE SAID TO

00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:09.073
BAKERSFIELD ARC- THIS

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.277
CONNECTIONS ARE MADE TO OTHER

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:15.046
SERVICES- ARTIST. MAJOR ISSUE

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:16.948
FOR A- LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:18.983
WE I DON'T. THAT EXACTLY TO US

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.752
THERE'S THEY'LL BE CIVIC FUNDING

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:22.754
TO COMPLETE PERCENT. STILL

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.391
SEGMENT. PROBABLY THIS IS

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:27.659
BECAUSE COST COULD INCREASE AND

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:29.260
I KNOW THAT THEY CAN BE IS VERY

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:30.228
WELL AWARE THAT THERE'S BEEN A

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:31.796
HIS ACROSS INCREASES ON ON THIS

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:32.397
PART. AND CERTAINLY LARGE AND

00:30:32.463 --> 00:30:34.299
COMPLEX PROJECTS LIKE- THERE'S

00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:35.333
INHERENT RISK THAT COSTS WILL

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.735
INCREASE ALSO BECAUSE REALLY

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:40.405
THERE WASN'T- THERE HAVE BEEN A

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:42.574
LOT OF UPDATES LAST IN TERMS THE

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.741
CONSTANT AT THE COST OF MERCED

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:46.311
TO BAKER'S. I'M CERTAINLY YOU

00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:47.278
KNOW IT THOSE WERE UPDATED WE

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:48.880
THINK THAT THEY THEY COULD WELL

00:30:48.947 --> 00:30:51.049
BE HIGHER ON AND THERE COUPLE

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:52.717
REASONS WE THINK- WE THINK THIS

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:54.419
COULD BE HIGHER IF THEY IF THEY

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:57.155
WERE FULLY UPDATED- ONE OF THEM

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:59.557
IS THAT- THEREARE YOUR STANDING

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:01.326
IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CLAIMS

00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:02.293
THAT ARE BEING MADE BY THE

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.030
CONTRACTORS ARE CURRENTLY DOING

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.065
WORK ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:07.799
AND SOME OF THOSE KINDS COULD

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:09.500
POTENTIALLY BE SAID. AND SO ONCE

00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:11.636
THOSE COSTS ARE FULLY. INTO THAT

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:14.205
THE COST ESTIMATE- YOU KNOW ONCE

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:15.773
THEY'RE STARTED. BY THICK OR ANY

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.408
KIND OF. REACHES SETTLEMENT AND

00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:19.077
THERE'S A BROUGHT IN- THAT COULD

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:20.378
CERTAINLY INCREASE COSTS OF THAT

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:21.913
SEGMENT- AND THEREFORE THE

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:26.551
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. OF ONE

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:27.652
HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILES ON

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.320
THANK. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:31.422
NOTE THAT EVEN JUST IN THE LAST

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:33.091
YEAR STATE- REALLY THIS IS BEEN

00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:36.628
A UP ABOVE. EVEN THAN- DYNAMIC

00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:37.862
BUT THERE BEEN THINK BECAUSE

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:38.696
INCREASES RELATED TO

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:40.331
CONSTRUCTION- COST ESCALATION

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:42.333
AND CERTAINLY WE THINK THAT

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.234
COULD IT. COULD AFFECT THE COST

00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:46.404
OF THE PROJECT. YOU TO RELATE TO

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:48.640
Y. EIGHT IT'S UNCLEAR IF THEY'LL

00:31:48.706 --> 00:31:49.774
BE SUFFICIENT FOR RESEARCH TO

00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:51.776
BAKER'S. IS THAT SOME OF THE

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:53.111
FUNDING THAT'S PROJECTED MAY NOT

00:31:53.177 --> 00:31:55.880
MATERIALIZE. AND WE GOT THAT AS

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:57.282
I MENTIONED BEFORE THE THERE'S

00:31:57.348 --> 00:31:58.816
RENOWNED COULD SCENARIO THAT

00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:02.086
ISSUE. THAT SORT OF A HIGHER AND

00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:03.454
HIGHER REVENUE FROM CAP AND

00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:04.522
TRADE THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:06.491
RECENTLY WILL CONTINUE TO TWENTY

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:07.325
THIRTY AND WE THINK THERE'S A

00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:08.426
LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THEY

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:09.560
BASICALLY USE OUR OFFICES

00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:11.596
PROJECTION THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:13.298
TO TWENTY THREE EXPENSE. THE

00:32:13.364 --> 00:32:14.732
TWENTY THIRTY I THINK THERE'S A

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:15.833
LOT OF UNCERTAINTY- RELATED TO

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.302
WHAT HAPPENED TRIANGLE DO

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:19.003
PARTICULARLY ARE OUT INTO THE

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.039
FUTURE. AND SO IT'S CERTAINLY

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.141
POSSIBLE THAT THAT- ESPECIALLY

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:29.347
THAT HIGHER REVENUE SCENARIO- AT

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:31.482
ME NOT TO REALIZE. I WE KNOW

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:33.251
THAT THERE'S NO BY PLAN. WORST

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:36.954
TO BAKER- THE OCCURRING READ

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:38.990
ABOUT THE OF YOU SOME OTHER

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:40.892
FUNDING INCLUDING OF THE SOME

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:42.193
FROM THE FOR TRANSFERRED PACKAGE

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.462
WHICH I THEY CAN WILL BE BACK-

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:45.963
EXTENDING CAP AND TRADE TWENTY

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.666
FIFTH SICK. SINGAPORE THAT THE

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:51.302
THREE OF TYPICALLY GOT THE 25%

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:52.337
I'M MORE THINKING FEDERAL FOR

00:32:52.403 --> 00:32:52.837
YOUTH THREE THE FEDERAL

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:53.371
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WOULD

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:56.040
PROVIDE THEM. GRANT POTS THAT

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:56.974
THE THREE COULD POTENTIALLY

00:32:57.041 --> 00:32:58.843
COMPETE FOR. HOWEVER THESE

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.411
FUNDING SOURCES- REALLY ARE

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:01.479
SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:03.848
UNCERTAINTIES SO IT'S UNCLEAR-

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:06.417
REALLY HOW MUCH THEY'LL THEY'LL

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:08.786
BRING IN. I FOR WE IDENTIFIED

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:11.422
THAT THE AT THE- PRETTY ACTION

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:13.391
THANK CONSTRAIN SOME. SOME

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:14.859
ALTERNATIVES TO THE FUTURE.

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:17.028
THREE WE I DID THREE. ACTIONS

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:19.430
THAT KIND OF TERM MATCH. ONE IS

00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:20.932
THAT THE PLANTS AWARD A TRACKING

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.734
SYSTEMS. AND THIS WOULD BE FOR

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.103
ELECTRIFIED AND NON ELECTRIFIED

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:26.971
TRACKING SYSTEMS LATER THIS YEAR

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:28.639
LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:30.608
SO THAT WILL FURTHER COMMIT THE

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:33.277
STATE TO ELECTRIFICATION AND

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.579
REALLY TAKING THAT APPROACH.

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:35.847
SECOND THE AUTHORITIES PLANNING

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:39.150
ADDITIONAL ACT- BEYOND TO BAKER

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:40.852
THINK ADVANCE DESIGN AND THEN

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:43.521
WHAT'S A DANCE IS. THE IT'LL

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:45.123
START TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:46.791
LIKE- ACQUIRE PERSON AND THOSE

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:47.992
KINDS OF STEPS WILL AGAIN I

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:50.528
KINDA- THIS THE THIS STATE

00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:52.563
MORNING. TOWARD COMPLETING-

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.900
OTHER PORTIONS THAT. ONE AND

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:58.202
THEN THIRD- WE KNOW THAT THE

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:00.138
AUTHORITY AND- TO SEEK SOME

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:02.306
FEDERAL. I THINK A MENTION

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.275
INCLUDING FROM A THE FEDERAL.

00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:06.344
BILL AND THERE COULD BE SOME. OF

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:08.446
GRANTED- AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:09.447
SURE THAT WHATEVER PROVISIONS

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:10.882
INCLUDED THIS GRANT AGREEMENT

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:12.350
IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH THEM IN A

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:15.286
LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE. I DON'T

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:18.456
WANT PAGE SEVEN. WE HIGHLIGHT

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.224
SOME KEY DECISIONS THAT WE

00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:21.392
REALLY THINK THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:22.960
KIND OF WANT TO THINK ABOUT-

00:34:23.027 --> 00:34:24.662
THIS YEAR. WE THINK A

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.164
FUNDAMENTAL CHOICE REALLY FACING

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.232
THE LEGISLATURE IS ITS LEVEL OF

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.400
COMMITMENT TO FULLY FUNDING THE

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:30.968
PROJECT. AND THAT'S NOT JUST

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:32.203
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IS REALLY

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.572
FUTURE PHASES AS WELL. DEPENDING

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.040
ON THAT SCOPE THAT THE

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:37.275
LEGISLATURE COMMITTED TO FINDING

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.342
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE WILL

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:39.677
WANT TO TAKE DIFFERENT ACTIONS

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:41.679
BOTH REGARDING ITS FINDINGS

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:42.980
RESIDENTS AS WELL AS THE

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:44.215
STATUTORY DIRECTION THAT

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:46.851
PROVIDE- WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.320
TO LEGISLATURE MAKE ITS CHOICES.

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:51.689
YOU CAN. REACH GOING TO CONTINUE

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:53.057
GOING TO YOU KNOW TAKE SOME

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:58.896
STEPS. THAT WILL PROBABLY. YOU

00:34:58.963 --> 00:35:00.998
KNOW ADVANCE PLAN COMPLETE- WORK

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.533
AND I LIKE TO PAY WITH A BIGGER

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:07.238
SAY AND- MAKE PROGRESS. TOWARDS

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:10.475
THE- AND THOSE ARE ARE BECAUSE

00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:13.077
CENTERS THAT. I'M OF THE

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.212
LEGISLATURE COMFORTABLE WE THE

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:16.080
AUTHORITY APPROACH AND IT'S TO

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:18.616
FULLY FUND NOT DISBURSING FIELD

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:21.052
BUT ALSO ALL THE PHASE ONE WE IT

00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:22.253
MAKES SENSE TO APPROACH THE PROP

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.821
ONE A. AS ITS PROPOSED AND

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:25.790
REQUEST BY THE GUY- WE NEVER

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:27.225
THAT THERE'S SOME RISK THAT

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.259
WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE IT JUST

00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:29.460
FUNDING TO COMPLY OR SAID TO.

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:34.999
FEEL. BUT THERE ARE HIGHER COST

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:36.901
OR SOME OF THE THAT CAN THINK

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:38.769
THAT. AND ADDITIONAL WE THINK

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:40.438
THAT THEY- I HIGHLY HAD THIS

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:41.038
WOULD HAVE TO COME.

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:41.873
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPLETE

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:43.975
PHASE ONE. UNLIKELY FROM THE

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:48.045
GENERAL. I AND IF THE

00:35:48.112 --> 00:35:48.579
LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:50.114
PRESERVE BUT THE BILL TO PUSH

00:35:50.181 --> 00:35:51.415
OTHER. APPROACHES AND THEN THE

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:54.952
ONE THAT. WERE INVITED TO. WE

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:57.822
WERE THAT MAKE BUDGET. THAT PER

00:35:57.889 --> 00:36:00.358
. ITS NATURAL. POINTS AND IT'S

00:36:00.424 --> 00:36:01.659
FIFTY CONTROL THE PROJECT HE HAD

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:02.693
THIS PROJECT DOESN'T HAVE A OF

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.328
NOT THIS IS A POINT IN FIFTH

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:05.329
CONTROL WITH THE COULD YOU.

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:06.898
APPROPRIATION AND THIS IS TO THE

00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:09.200
LAST. THE LAST MAJOR POOR PROP

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:11.302
ONE A. IT ALREADY PROBABLY WON'T

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:13.471
HAVE TO COME. FOR APPROPRIATION

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:14.438
. FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND IT MAY

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:15.806
NOT BE ABLE OF ACTUALLY. POINT

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:18.175
SO- LEGISLATURE ME WHEN I

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:20.678
PRESERVE THOSE AND ALSO PROVIDE-

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:23.214
FROM STATUTORY CHANGES. THAT-

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:24.649
THAT HELP PRESERVE ITS FOR. SO

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:26.517
WITH HER TO THE THIS IS POINTS.

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:28.619
I A COUPLE OF. THE LEGISLATURE

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:30.621

WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK TO ASK

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:40.231
FUNDING- PERMITTING BANDS.

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:42.066
FOURTEEN WE IDENTIFY ABOUT. OF

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:43.334
MODIFYING TO CONTINUE ITS

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:44.735
APPROPRIATION PROJECT HAS SO

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:51.642
IT'S BEEN RECEIVING. TWENTY CAP

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:53.844
VERY FLEXIBLE MAKING USE THEM

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:55.379
FOR A OF DIFFERENT. 'M THE

00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:56.480
LEGISLATURE COULD MY TO THAT FOR

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:58.516
EXAMPLE. CAP AND TRADE ON ANY

00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:01.118

CASH MONEY TO THE- AND AGAIN THE

THREE WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:06.123
FOR. A REQUEST THAT WOULD GIVE

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.758
LEGISLATURE NATURAL TO. IT'S

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:09.660
CHECK A WITH THE PRIDE. AND MAKE

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:12.196
SURE IT'S ON TRACK. I WOULD BE

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:13.397
TO STAFF. CHIU TO PRESERVE

00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:15.833
CHOICES IDENTIFIED. OF ON. COULD

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.202
CAN SAY FOR. IT COULD END UP

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:19.403
BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE THAT

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.738
LIMITS OR PREVENTS THE AUTHORITY

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:22.273
EXPENDING FUNDS BEYOND WHATEVER

EXISTING FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:29.180
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:30.581
ENVIRONMENTAL FOR PHASE ONE TO

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:31.382
THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:32.416
GRANT AGREEMENT. BUT BEYOND THAT

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:35.987
THE LEGISLATURE COULD LIMIT. THE

00:37:36.053 --> 00:37:38.756
PRETTY. I THIS WOULD BE. BECAUSE

00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:39.991
THAT'S WHERE YOU GET. HAVE A

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:42.493

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:46.230
BETWEEN THEIR- ABOUT IT COULD

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:48.199
THE LEGISLATURE NOT COMMITTED

00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:49.967
TO. MAKE TICKETS COMPLETING WORK

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.369
BEYOND THAT YOU CAN PROTECT

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:53.371
RESULT IN STRANDED- IF THE

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:54.171
LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY DOES.

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:57.008
FIND THE FEATURES. OR EXACT.

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:58.976
POTENTIAL PEOPLE CUTTING DOWN-

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:01.178
FROM CENTER. IF FUNDING THAT I'M

00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:02.313
IS CURRENTLY. FOR THAT PERCENT

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.316
BIG. THING IS YOU. OTHER PARTS.

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.752
I MET- AND ANOTHER OPTION THAT

00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:10.621
WE- IT'LL JUST. COULD

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.223

THE- COMPRA. WITH SPENDING THAT

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.866
WOULD BE. IN STATURE- AND WE

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:22.733
THINK THIS COULD BE IMPORTANT

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.568
GIVEN THAT AGAIN YOU'VE ALREADY

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:25.670
HAS A HISTORY OF ENTERING INTO

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:27.505
SOME GREAT AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.407
CONSTRAINED LEGISLATIVE CHOICES-

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:31.008
SO THIS WOULD HELP PRESERVE

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:32.109
HELP. THEM PREVENT THAT FROM

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:33.678
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. AND

OVERALL THE TWENTY TWO DRAFT

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.772
PLAN DOESN'T BRING MUCH NEW

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.774
INFORMATION TO THE TABLE. IT

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:18.876
CONTAINS A CENTRALLY MOST OF THE

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:19.977
NUMBERS AND THE FACTS AND THE

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:22.112
THRUST OF THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:24.548
BUSINESS PLAN. THERE ARE SOME

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:26.417
POSITIVE ELEMENTS THAT ARE NEW

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:28.419
AND THEY'RE USEFUL TO RECOGNIZE

00:41:28.485 --> 00:41:29.954
FIRST. THERE IS A REAL

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.856
POSSIBILITY FOR NEW FEDERAL

00:41:31.922 --> 00:41:34.024
FUNDING. THOUGH THE AMOUNTS AND

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.826
THE DEGREE OF CALIFORNIANS

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:37.394
PARTICIPATION ARE NOT YET

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:40.097
DEFINED. WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:42.032
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR OTHER

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:44.068
FUNDING AND FOR EXAMPLE TO BUILD

00:41:44.134 --> 00:41:46.303
BACK BETTER BE A WHOLE. LOT IF

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.839
ANY BUT IN ANY CASE NONE OF THIS

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:50.407
WILL REFORM TO RESOLVE THE

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:53.410
STATE'S FUNDING PROBLEMS OF THE

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:55.412
PROJECT. THE REASON RUPE BETTER

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:57.248
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEGATIVE

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:59.116
IMPACT OF COVERED ON THE PROJECT

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.517
AND THAT IMPACT HAS BEEN

00:42:00.584 --> 00:42:02.553
SIGNIFICANT AND WE NEED TO

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.654
ACKNOWLEDGE IT. THE

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:05.322
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCES ARE

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:07.958
MOVING AHEAD THERE IS A BETTER

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:09.860
AND MORE POSITIVE RECOGNITION OF

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:11.795
THE IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTIVITY

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:13.898
AND IMPACTS ON LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:16.133
OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. THIS IS

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.368
IMPORTANT TO THE STATE'S

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:18.869
TRANSPORT NETWORK AND IT

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.337
HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:22.239
SUPPORTING AGENCIES NOT JUST THE

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:24.275
HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IN

00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:25.609
THIS IS A POINT WE HAVE TRIED TO

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:28.212
TOUCH ON BEFORE THAT THERE IS

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:29.980
MORE TO THIS THAN JUST SPEED

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:33.083
RAIL AUTHORITY'S ROLE. THEN THE

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.485
OTHER HAS BEEN INTRODUCING

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:36.654
BETTER MANAGEMENT. INCLUDING

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.289
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT AND

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:40.391
STAGE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT THESE

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:42.359
TOOLS HAVE BEEN LONG NEEDED THEY

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:44.395
ARE TIMELY AND THEY SHOULD HAVE

00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:46.864
AN IMPACT ON MANAGING COST

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:49.033
CONTROLS. BUT AND THIS IS

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:51.735
IMPORTANT. THERE IS A WIDE RANGE

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:53.671
OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT COST AND

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:55.539
SCHEDULES THAT REMAINS IN FACT

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:59.843
IT PROBABLY HAS EVEN INCREASED

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.679
BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS.

00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:02.947
FIRST THE CONSTANTS GADGIL

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:05.049
EXPERIENCE SO FAR IS NOT

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:07.851
ENCOURAGING. THE AVERAGE COST

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.186
INCREASE ON THE CONSTRUCTION

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:11.555
PROJECT ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:13.624
IS EIGHTY SIX POINT SEVEN

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:15.726
PERCENT. AND THE AVERAGE GRADUAL

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:20.064
INCREASES A 118% REAL ESTATE

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.733
PARCELS ARE STILL ONLY 90% THE

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.302
CARD THE RIVER ROAD PARTIALS OR

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.237
73% REQUIRED IN THE TIER ONE

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:30.708
UTILITY PARCELS ARE ONLY 65%

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:33.544
REQUIRED. THIS IS AFTER SIXTY

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:36.847
NINE YEARS OF CONTRACT AWARDS.

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:39.416
THIS EXPERIENCE DOES NOT INCLUDE

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:41.051
CLAIMS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FILED

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:42.753

ACCOUNT FOR FUTURE CLAIMS THAT

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:48.993
HAVE NOT YET BEEN FILED BUT MAKE

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:51.996
WILL BE. THE PROJECT BUDGETS

00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:54.898
WERE OUT OF DATE. DASHBOARDS

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:56.100
THAT WORD MEANT TO PROVIDE A

A 116% THE NEXT THOROUGH UPDATE

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:26.764

TWENTY TWENTY THREE PROJECT- DAY

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:30.200
REPORTS OF THAT'LL BE SOMETHING

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:32.436
MORE THAN A YEAR FROM NOW. THERE

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.605
IS AS YET NO EXPERIENCE WITH

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:36.240
MAJOR PROJECT COMPONENTS THAT

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:37.941
REPRESENT MORE THAN HALF OF THE

00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:39.543
COST OF THE PROJECT THAT MEANS

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.912
TIMELINE ELECTRIFICATION

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:43.881
SIGNALLING AND ROLLING STOCK. IN

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:45.582
THIS REGARD IT'S USEFUL TO NOTE

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:47.651
THAT CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:49.720
PROJECT IS ABOUT 25% OVER

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:52.356
BUDGET. IN THE BART VTA

00:44:52.423 --> 00:44:53.590
EXPERIENCE WITH THESE TYPES OF

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:55.526
COMPONENTS HAS NOT BEEN

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:58.562
ENCOURAGING. IN ADDITION AND MAY

00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:00.164
BE OVER WRITING THAT'S THE

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.232
AFTERMATH OF CODED AND POSSIBLY

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:03.967
OF THE UKRAINE DISCREET WE DON'T

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:07.004
KNOW THIS YET. MAY PRESAGE AND

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:08.539
AFTER A PERIOD OF UNUSUALLY

00:45:08.605 --> 00:45:10.374
RAPID COST ESCALATION THAT COULD

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.276
TAKE TIME TO WORK THROUGH THE

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:14.111
SYSTEM AND COULD LEAD TO FURTHER

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:16.613
COST INCREASES. OVERALL AS I

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.549
SAID THE UNCERTAINTY THAT AND

00:45:18.615 --> 00:45:20.150
THIS PROJECT RIGHT NOW IS VERY

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:22.853
SIGNIFICANT AND IT MAY BE

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.090
INCREASING. END YOUR LOWER PRIOR

00:45:26.156 --> 00:45:27.925
ISSUES AND CRITICAL ISSUES THAT

00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:29.860
REMAIN UNADDRESSED AND

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:31.595
UNRESOLVED THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:34.231
SHOULD BE AWARE. PRIMARY

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:36.500
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HAS NOT

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.202
IMPROVED RELATIVE TO THE

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:40.904
CHALLENGES AND THE EXTREME.

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:43.640
RIDER SECOND THE FUNDING AS WE

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:45.175
HAVE SAID MANY TIMES IS

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:47.211
INADEQUATE AND IT'S UNSTABLE AND

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:48.712
THAT MAKES MANAGED OF THE

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:51.615
PROJECT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:54.318
NOT IMPOSSIBLE. THIRD EVEN WITH

00:45:54.384 --> 00:45:56.153
NEW FEDERAL FUNDING THE STATE

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.222
CANNOT GET OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL

00:45:58.288 --> 00:46:00.224
VALLEY THE PROJECT CAN'T GET

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.825
OUTSIDE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:04.628
WITHOUT ADDED STATE FUNDING FROM

SOURCES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN

00:46:07.197 --> 00:46:08.866

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.501
WE LOOK AT ALL THIS TOGETHER WE

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:11.869

ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEAR. THAT IS

00:53:18.828 --> 00:53:20.030
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT WILL

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:08.091
TWENTY TWENTY THREE HOWEVER WE

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:10.093
KNOW THAT INFLATION DELAYS AND

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.961
THE CURRENT COST OF MATERIALS.

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:13.730
MUST IMPACT THE TOTAL COST OF

00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:15.932
THE PROJECT. CAN THE AUTHORITY

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:18.401
EXPLAINED WHY THESE WERE NOT

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:20.837
EVALUATED AS PART OF THE- TWENTY

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:23.439
TWO BUSINESS PLAN. MISTER

00:57:23.506 --> 00:57:24.974
CHAIRMAN THE ANSWER IS MOSTLY

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.009
BECAUSE THEY WERE THEY WERE

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:28.578
EVALUATED IN THE PLAN THAT WE

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:30.180
RELEASED JUST TEN MONTHS AGO.

00:57:30.246 --> 00:57:32.315
AND WE HAVE NOT MADE. OF UPDATES

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:33.883
TO THOSE AT THIS POINT WITH

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.318
RESPECT TO THE INFLATION THAT'S

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:38.621
A PART OF THE- CONSUMER. PRICE

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:40.824
INDEX FOR THE OTHER ELEMNTS. WE

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.091
CONDUCT A REVIEW OF OUR PROPOSED

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:44.294
CONSTRUCTION ESCALATION RATES IN

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.029
THE BUSINESS PLAN. AND COMPARE

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:47.530
THAT TO THE US ARMY CORPS OF

00:57:47.597 --> 00:57:49.465
ENGINEERS ESCALATION MANUAL

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:51.334
WHICH IS CALLED THE CIVIL WORKS

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.069
CONSTRUCTION COST INDEX SYSTEM.

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:55.038
RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE TWENTY

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:57.507
TWO ESCALATION RATES ARE WITHIN

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:58.107
THE RANGES AS COMPARED TO THE

00:57:58.174 --> 00:58:00.543
LONG TERM- LET'S WORK WILL

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.378
PERFORMANCE OF THE INDEX. AND SO

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:03.580
WE'RE NOT MAKING AN ADJUSTMENT

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:05.715
AT THIS TIME WE NOTE. THAT THE

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:08.084
INFLATION BLIP HERE IS AT THIS

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:11.888
TIME. UP A POINT IN TIME- EVENT

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:13.256
. OUR PROJECTIONS IN OUR

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.858
ESCALATION RATES COVER MULTIPLE

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:18.695
YEARS. AGO FOR. A LONGER PERIOD

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:20.363
OF TIME THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.233
TO MONITOR AND WATCH. A THAT IT

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:24.467
WILL MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS WE

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:25.602
NEED TO MAKE AT THE APPROPRIATE

00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:27.403
TIME BUT AT THIS POINT BSED ON

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:30.306
THE METRIC WE USE. WE DIDN'T WE

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:31.474
DIDN'T MAKE THAT THAT'S- AND

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:32.375
THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:34.611
ADOPTION OF OUR FORMAL BUDGET

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:35.678
WHICH IS INTERNALLY HERE AT THE

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:38.181
OR- WE DID OUR BOARD DID

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:39.515
APPROVED AUTHORIZED EXPENDITURE

00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:41.017
THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:43.253
BUDGET THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE

00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:44.487
TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. IN

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:47.123
DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.558
AND THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT.

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:49.993
CHANGES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:52.195
THAT PLAN. THAT WE'RE COST

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:54.597
ESTIMATES BASED ON OUR INCREASES

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:57.367
IN THIS VALLEY MOSTLY TIED TO.

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:59.269
OUR SCOPE STILL GETTING IN THAT

00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:01.537
A CONTRACT FROM. DECISIONS WELL

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:04.240
BEFORE I ARRIVED HERE- HOWEVER

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:06.542
WE ARE FINALIZING THAT WORK NOW-

00:59:06.609 --> 00:59:08.811
BUT THE ACTIONS THAT WE TOOK. IN

00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:11.347
THE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS WE MADE A

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:13.383
WE ESTIMATE WILL BE SUFFICIENT.

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:14.550
TO COVER WHAT WHAT WE HAVE WHAT

00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:16.019
WE NOW KNOW WAS ARE NO COST

00:59:16.085 --> 00:59:18.454
ESTIMATES IN THAT REGARD. SO AS

00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:19.856
WE GO FORWARD AND WE WORK

00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:22.225
THROUGH- CONTINUES COPIOUS USE

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.359
ON THIS PROGRAM WE WILL UPDATE

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:26.062
AGAIN. AND WE WILL DO. AS SOON

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:27.563
AS WE COMPLETE SOME OF OUR

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.265
COMMERCIAL. THAT EXHAUSTION. AS

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:31.935
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE- OF.

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.469
NUMBERS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:37.607
BUDGET ARE BASED ON. TWENTY

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:38.207
NINETEEN- INFORMATION IS THAT

00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:43.780
CORRECT. THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:45.348
BUSINESS PLAN ESTIMATES ARE

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:47.517
BASED ON THE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:49.218
ESTIMATES THAT THAT WE PUT IN

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:51.154
PLACE JUST BEFORE WE RELEASE THE

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.889
PLAN AND THE PLAN WAS RELEASED

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:54.924
IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:57.193
ADOPTED IN APRIL OF TWENTY

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.628
TWENTY ONE WE UP TO UPDATE THEM

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:00.830
AS BEST WE CAN ALL THE WAY UNTIL

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:03.099
THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL PLAN-

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:05.435
AND SO THAT IS THOSE EXCLUDED

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:06.736
ARE ESTIMATES FOR WHERE WE

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:09.138
IDENTIFIED. ACOSTA MIGHT MOVE IN

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.673
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THAT PLAN

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.976
WE IDENTIFIED ABOUT ONE POINT

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:13.977
THREE BILLION IN COSTS THAT

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:15.778
WOULD GO UP WITH THE CENTRAL

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:18.147
VALLEY BASED ON- COMMERCIAL

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:20.717
DISPUTES AND CHANGE ORDERS THAT

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:23.119
WE- WERE NOT. INCLUDED IN THE

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:25.021
PRIOR A PROGRAM THAT WE DON'T

01:00:25.088 --> 01:00:27.323
NEED TO BE INCLUDED AND SO WE

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.225
ADJUSTED THE BUDGET AT THAT TIME

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.527
WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED NEW OR

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.429
ADDITIONAL ONES AT THIS POIT-

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:36.199
TO ADD TO THAT BUDGET. AND SO

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.400
ARE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.402
BUDGET WHICH REALLY ARE BOARD

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.670
DID NOT INCORPORATE UNTIL

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.572
DECEMBER OF TWENTY ONE JUST TWO

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:44.807
MONTHS AGO INCORPORATES OUR

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:46.743
ESTIMATE OF COSTS FOR THAT

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.911
SECTOR AND THE WOULD THAT

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:53.649
INCLUDE THE COST FOR CHANGE.

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:54.417
ORDERS- THAT WERE. YEAH YOU WITH

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.285
WE WILL AWARE OF WE ESTIMATED IN

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:57.754
THAT PROGRAM WHAT WE CALLED ARE

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.255
KNOWN AND UNKNOWN COSTS AND WE

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.657
DID THAT BY. CUTTING DOWN COSTS

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:03.059
IN THE SPECIFIC BUDGETS OF EACH

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:04.660
OF OUR CONSTRUCTION PACKAGES.

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:05.995
AND THAT WE INCLUDED A

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:07.196
CONTINGENCY INCREASE FOR EACH OF

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.032
THOSE PROTOCOLS ARE UNDER

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:11.067
BECAUSE WE ARE IN COMMERCIAL

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.335
DISPUTE OR COMMERCIAL SETTLEMENT

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:14.203
ISSUES WHICH YOU CONTRACTORS

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.472
NOW. AND AS THOSE RESOLVE IF

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:17.607
THERE'S ANY ADJUSTMENTS WE NEED

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:19.509
TO MAKE WILL INDICATE THAT TO

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:20.777
THE LEGISLATURE. AND WILL

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.612
INDICATE THAT TO MY BOARD PUBLIC

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:25.081
WITH. ADS BUT AT THIS POINT BUT

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:26.649
WE HAVE NOT MOVED OFF THE

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:27.950
ESTIMATES THAT WE PUT IN THE

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:31.220
TWENTY TWENTY. THIS IS. THANK

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:34.090
YOU AB. A FOR THE- IS-

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:35.825
CHRISTINE. OF WHAT ARE THE

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:37.894
OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE FOR

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.228
OVERSIGHT ON THE PROJECT CAN

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.997
YOU- REVIEW THOSE AGAIN FOR US

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:44.367
AND ALSO- INCLUDING REMARKS WHAT

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:46.135
HAPPENS IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:51.174
NOTHING. SURE THANK YOU AND JUST

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.275

BELIEVE IT WHAT I BELIEVE THAT

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:55.311
EVEN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.712
PLAN DIDN'T FULLY AT THE ALL THE

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:58.281
COST FOR THE WHOLE OF THESE ONES

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.382
THAT SOME OF THAT SO THERE ARE A

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:00.683
NUMBER OF BECAUSE THEY REALLY

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:01.918
HAVEN'T BEEN FULLY UPDATED SINCE

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.419
TWENTY NINETEEN SO I THINK THAT-

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:05.054
THAT THAT'S- THAT THAT IS STILL

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:06.622
AT AN IMPORTANT POINT. AND THEY

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:09.158
TRY TO MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION-

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.793

KNOW AS I MENTIONED IN MY

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.735
COMMENTS- I THINK WHAT IS.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:20.736
REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO THINK

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:23.039
ABOUT IS- YOU KNOW THE

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:24.040
LEGISLATURE HAVING A LITTLE BIT

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.075
MORE CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT OF

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:27.143
THIS PROJECT AND PART OF THAT IS

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.478
THESE NATURAL DECISION POINTS

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:29.512
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.647
BECAUSE- I'M PART OF YOU KNOW

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:34.117
THIS THIS PROJECT- AGAIN BECAUSE

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:35.051
THEY CONTINUE TO CORPORATION

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:36.752
BECAUSE THEY GET THESE BIG. YOU

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.187
KNOW BUCKET THE PROP ONE A. AND

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.288
THEN WE'RE GONNA BASICALLY BE

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:41.824
DEMOCRATS TWENTY NOW- AND THAT

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:42.625
BECAUSE HE WAS A PREPARATION

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.360
JUST KIND OF COMES IN ON THE

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:45.294
NATURAL THE LEGISLATURE ISN'T-

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.330
IT REQUIRED- YOUR DOES IT

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:48.931
DOESN'T HAVE YOU KNOW THAT HAVE

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.066
TO MAKE IT APPROPRIATIONS AND

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:52.502
ANNUAL BASIS- AND ALSO BECAUSE

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:54.871
THE AUTHORITY. IS REALLY

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.372
GOVERNED BY A BOARD AND THE

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.241
BOARD CAN MAKE A LOT OF CHOICES

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.343
THAT ARE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:01.277
GO TO THE LEGISLATIVE IT IF WE

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:03.346
DON'T HAVE TO GO TO LEGISLATURE

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:05.414
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT YOU KNOW

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:06.315
WHAT DINNER TO GRANT AGREEMENT

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.650
WANTS TO INTERFERE WANTS TO MAKE

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:08.684
OTHER CHOICES TO BEFORE THE

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.820
PROJECT- SO THIS PROJECT THIS

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:13.089
PROJECT CAN REALLY KIND OF- GO

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:15.558
ALONG ON ITS OWN WITHOUT. A LOT

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.660
OF LEGISLATIVE CONTROL AND LET

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:19.061
THE LEGISLATIVE LATE LEGISLATURE

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:21.164
SHOULD EXERT ITSELF I'M THIRTY

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.698
THINK ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.033
BE NATIONAL DECISION POINT THE

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.169
BUDGET PROCESS AGAIN I'M MAKING

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:27.069
YOU KNOW MAKING SOME

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.437
OPPORTUNITIES WITH ALLEGED WHERE

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:29.972
THAT ALREADY HAS TO COME BACK TO

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.073
THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK FOR

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.942
FUNDING. AND GET THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:34.644
OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU HAVE THE

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:35.878
AUTHORITY COME MAKE THANK YOU

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.380
KNOW COSTS GO UP NEXT YEAR WE

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:38.548
SEE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:39.849
PROJECT UPDATE REPORT

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:40.983
LEGISLATURE CAN REVIEW THOSE

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.652
COSTS CAN. ASK THOSE QUESTIONS

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:43.753
AND MAKE THOSE DECISIONS SO WE

01:03:43.819 --> 01:03:52.862
THINK THAT- ONE OPTION.

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:53.462
CERTAINLY ALSO PROVIDING MORE

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:54.063
STATUTORY DIRECTION RIGHT NOW

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.064
THE CABIN. FUNDS THEY MENTION

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:57.066
ARE RE. FIVE YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:57.967
THEY'RE REALLY JUST KIND GIVE

01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:59.368
INTO THE AUTHORITY FOR THE PER.

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:00.136
THOSE COULD BE USED YOU KNOW. I

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:02.004
ON THE ALIGNMENT FOR- AND- THAT

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:02.872
COULD BE A- AT THE- CONSISTENT

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:03.906
LEGISLATIVE. BUT THE LEGISLATURE

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:05.841
HAS. MORE DIRECTION ABOUT HOW IT

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:07.777
WANTS THOSE FUNDS TO BE USED OR

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:08.778
THE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS THEY

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:09.645
WANT THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:11.581
INTO- WE THINK IT'S PERFECTLY

01:04:11.647 --> 01:04:12.982
APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:16.118
TO- YOU KNOW TO. PROVIDE THAT

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:17.320
STATUTORY DIRECTION THAT WOULD

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:19.989
FURTHER- FOR DIRECTING IT TOWARD

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.123
THE END AND REALLY MAKE SURE

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.759
IT'S CLEARLY. TO THE AUTHORITY-

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:27.330
MISTER WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S-

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:29.265
YOU ARE. PREFERRED APPROACH IT

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:31.234
IS- THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.168
HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:34.670
RECENTLY- AS AN OFFICE BUT- I

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:35.938
KNOW OUR OFFICE BROUGHT UP.

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.607
SEVERAL YEARS AGO FOR EXAMPLE

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:39.642
AND BACK WAY BACK IN TWO

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:40.576
THOUSAND ELEVEN IT FEELS LIKE A

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:41.711
ALMOST A DIFFERENT WORLD A LOT

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:42.812
OF THE PRAHLAD OF THE ISSUES

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:44.447
FACING THE PROJECT. ARE STILL

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:47.216
SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES- THAT WE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.685
WERE TACKLING YOUR TEN YEARS AGO

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:51.420
. WORK FOR EXAMPLE WE TALKED

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.389
SOME ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WITH

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:54.991
THIS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FROM

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:56.592
THE LEGISLATURE. PERSPECTIVE

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:58.427
ABOUT THE BOARD HAVING A LOT OF.

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.630
SORT OF ACT. YEAH A LOT OF

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:03.099
MATURITY AND- AND SOMETIMES IT

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:04.500
BEING HARD FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.168
HAVE OVERSIGHT TO THAT PROCESS.

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.270
TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT

01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:08.537
REPORT ABOUT SOME DIFFERENT

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:10.840
OPTIONS FOR POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:12.141
YOU'RE MODIFYING THE BOARD- SO

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.776
THERE ARE A LOT OF CHOICES YOU%

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:14.577
COULD ALSO HAVE SOME SORT OF

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:16.012
SEPARATE COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE I

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:17.813
KNOW IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT- BY

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.515
FOLKS YOU KNOW THAT BUT LOOK AT

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:20.549
CHANGE ORDERS OR SOME KIND OF

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:22.051
OUTSIDE GROUP THAT LOOKS. THAT

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:24.020
LOOKS AT THE AUTHORITY- OR THAT

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.821
COULD DO YOU I'VE EVER VICE COST

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:26.656
ESTIMATE FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S AND

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:28.824

RIDERSHIP AND COST ESTIMATES

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:38.501
BUT- YOU KNOW ANOTHER OPTION AS

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:42.805
WELL. YOU KNOW. SHOULD THIRD

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:44.006

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.474
OF THOSE. THAT THEY'RE A WHOLE.

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.276
OF OCT. THAT I KNOW- HAVE BEEN

THE- OVER OVER THE YEARS- WITH

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:51.314
THIS PROJECT- THEY'RE PROBABLY.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.448
YOU KNOW A NUMBER IN THE

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:54.183
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.651
AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF OUR

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:57.253
REMARKS TODAY WE REALLY FOCUSED

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.755
ON A FEW- A FEW RELATED TO THIS

01:05:59.822 --> 01:06:01.857
DECISION POINTS AND PROVIDING

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.059
THAT STATUTORY DIRECTION BUT-

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.360
BUT THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:05.328
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED IF THE

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:07.196
LEGISLATURE- IS INTERESTED IN.

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:08.731
AND FURTHER PURSUING ANY OF

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:13.202
THOSE- THOSE POSSIBILITIES.

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:14.036
THANKS VERY MUCH MS FRIEDMAN.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.338
THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:16.939
ALL THREE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:19.909
AND- SPENDING TIME WITH US THIS

01:06:19.975 --> 01:06:23.512
MORNING- YOU KNOW I. STILL BUY

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:24.280
INTO THE DREAM OF HIGH SPEED

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:26.015
RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. I STILL

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:27.850
THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.853
VISION FOR- FOR TRANSPORTATION

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.021
IN THE FUTURE AND SOMETHING THAT

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.389
COULD BE HUGELY BENEFICIAL TO

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.024
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS A GROSS.

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:37.026
AS WELL. BUT I ALSO REMAIN

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:40.529
CONCERNED- ABOUT THE PROJECT-

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:46.202
GIVEN. ALL OF THE- ISSUES THAT

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:48.104
IT HAS WITH FUNDING AND IT'S

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.138
CERTAINLY NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:50.706
AUTHORITY'S FAULT- BUT THE

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.608
PROJECT IS UNDERFUNDED FOR WHAT

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.543
IT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED. HOW

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.645
MUCH IS UNCLEAR YOU KNOW WE HEAR

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:57.680
DIFFERENT NUMBERS FROM DIFFERENT

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:59.281
GROUPS- WE HEARD TODAY FROM

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.283
MISTER THOMPSON CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.052
THE COST CONTINUING TO ESCALATE

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:05.888
BEYOND WHAT WE SEE IN THIS-

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:08.891
DRAFT A BUSINESS PLAN. AND WE

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:11.160
ARE IN AN UNKNOWN OF A POSITION

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:12.495
IN TERMS OF FEDERAL FUNDING AND

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:14.029
WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:15.998
TO BE ATTAINABLE. AND AT SOME

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:18.334
POINT. IN THE EGISLATURE OR THE

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:19.335
VOTERS ARE BOTH ARE GOING TO

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:21.370
HAVE TO ALLOCATE QUITE A BIT OF

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:23.205
MONEY TO FINISH THIS PROJECT.

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:26.742
AND MY- REASON FOR QUESTIONING

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:28.144
THE BUSINESS PLANET EVERY POINT

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.879
THAT WE CAN IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.147
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:32.848
THAT THE POINT WHICH IS OF THE

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.383
LEGISLATURE THE VOTERS ARE BOTH.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:37.153
ARE ASKED TO GIVE ALLOCATE A LOT

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.187
OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO THIS

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:40.523
PROJECT. IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.324
BEST SHAPE IT CAN BE IT NEEDS TO

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:43.859
BE SOMETHING THAT IS SHOWING THE

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:47.696
PROMISE OF WHAT HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:48.597
COULD MEAN FOR THESE REGIONS. I

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:51.634
REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT. FOCUSING

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.636
ON BUYING TRAINS AND RUNNING

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:55.738
TRACK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:56.939
MILES RUNNING THROUGH HIGH SPEED

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:59.041
ELECTRIFIED TRAIN FOR A HUNDRED

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.776
FIFTY MILES WHICH IS NOT AN

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:02.611
ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF DISTANCE TO

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:03.245
SHOW THE PROMISE OF THE

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:05.347
TECHNOLOGY AND IN THIS CURRENT

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:06.415
BUSINESS PLAN AS FAR AS I CAN

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:08.451
SEE WE'RE NOT RUNNING IT INTO

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:09.685
OUR POPULATION CENTERS TO

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.720
DEVELOP THE KIND OF RIDERSHIP

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:13.255
THAT A SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM WOULD

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:18.527
DO. SO I. CONTINUE TO THINK THAT

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.663
WE SHOULD. LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.199
AT LEAST HAVE. AT THE POINT AT

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.034
WHICH THE BOND MONEY IS

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.302
FINISHED. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.037
COMING BACK TO LOOKING FOR

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:30.773
ANOTHER LARGE. POT OF MONEY.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.775
THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT HAS

01:08:32.842 --> 01:08:35.845
AS MUCH UTILITY. FOR ACTUAL

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:38.013
WRITERS AS POSSIBLE. IF THERE

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.782
ARE PEOPLE RIDING THE SYSTEM

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:41.150
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO CONVINCE

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:42.718
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.954
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IT. IF IT

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.355
IS A TRAIN THAT'S FAST RUNNING

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:48.491
BACK AND FORTH. WITHOUT A LOT OF

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:50.292
WRITERS I THINK THAT A LOT OF

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.494
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN NAY

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.595
SAYERS AND MAYBE EVEN THOSE WHO

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:54.597
HAVE BEEN SUPPORT BY HAVE SECOND

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.832
THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PROJECT. WE

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.367
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ABILITY IN

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:00.135
THIS LEGISLATURE TO IMPACT THIS

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:01.971
PROJECT EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.639
US FOR FUNDING THAT'S OUR ONLY

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:04.907
OPPORTUNITY IS THE ALEJO'S JUST

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.675
SAID. WE NEED TO USE THIS

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:07.977
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT AS

01:09:08.043 --> 01:09:09.712
WE MOVE FORWARD WE DO IT. WITH

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:11.447
THE BEST POSSIBLE BUT PLAN THAT

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:14.583
WE CAN. SO WHEN I WHEN I ASK

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.051
QUESTIONS IT'S NOT AN ATTACK ON

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:17.219
ANYONE IN PARTICULAR I THINK

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:19.021
THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:19.688
AUTHORITY. HAS BEEN GIVEN A

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:21.991
DIFFICULT TASK. OF A PROJECT

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:22.691
THAT IN SOME WAYS IS

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:25.661
UNDERFUNDED. AND HAS A LOT OF

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:28.030
EXPECTATIONS. AND OF COURSE

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:29.198
THEY'RE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.666
GET AS MUCH BUILT AS THEY CAN

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:34.370
WITHIN THEIR ORIGINAL MANDATE-

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:36.939
BUT IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT FOR

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.140
US TO MAKE DECISIONS WHEN WE

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:39.341
DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.342
WE EVEN HAVE WHEN WE DON'T KNOW

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:41.577
WHAT'S COMING FROM THE FEDERAL

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:42.645
GOVERNMENT. AND WE DON'T KNOW

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:43.846
WHAT THIS PROJECT EVEN TO FINISH

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:45.147
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IT'S

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:46.882
ACTUALLY GOING TO COST. THERE

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:47.850
ARE STILL SEGMENTS THAT HAVE

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.585
BEEN PURCHASED WERE HEARING. A

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:50.953
DIFFERENT ANALYSIS FOR MISTER

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.187
THOMPSON FROM THE INDEPENDENT

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:54.056
PEER REVIEW GROUP ABOUT COST THE

01:09:54.123 --> 01:09:56.425
MORE HEARING THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:59.662
REFLECTED IN THE BUSINESS PLAN-

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:01.897
I WANTED TO ASK. ALL THREE. AND

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.198
I'M SORRY BUT AT TEN THIRTY I

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:04.066
ACTUALLY HAVE TO LEAVE FOR A FEW

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:05.868
MINUTES- AMONG THE URBAN

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:06.802
SCHEDULE PREVIOUSLY AND I'LL

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.870
COME BACK AND I'VE ASKED MY

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.138
STAFF TO BOOK MARKING TAPE

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:10.339
EVERYTHING SO I CAN HEAR ALL THE

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:12.074
ANSWERS. BUT I THINK MAYBE IF I

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:14.043
CAN ASK A FEW QUESTIONS. AND

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:15.945
THAT WAY IF I NEED TO LEAVE

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:17.379
THEIR OF THEIR ASSETS. I WANTED

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:17.980
TO KNOW YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.715
SOME DIFFERENT- SUGGESTIONS

01:10:19.782 --> 01:10:21.517
ABOUT SPENDING MONEY. IN OTHER

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:23.185
PARTS OF THE STATE ON CALTRAIN

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:25.521
OR ON- YOU KNOW LACE ISN'T IN

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:27.256
LOS ANGELES. AND YET WE HEAR

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.891
THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE THE FUNDING

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:30.159
AVAILABLE WITHIN WHAT WE HAVE.

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:31.594
TO FINISH MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.329
SO I WANTED TO ASK ALL THREE.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.763
ABOUT THE OPTION OF NOT SPENDING

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.699
ANY MONEY OUTSIDE OF THE MERCED

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:40.502
BAKERSFIELD- PROJECT AREA INTO

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.237
AND- UNTIL WE'VE COMPLETED THAT.

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.539
I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE WISDOM

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.707
OF ACTUALLY ENTERING INTO

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.208
TRACKING SYSTEM CONTRACTS AND

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:48.210
ESSENTIALLY BUYING TRAINS.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.612
BEFORE WE'VE HAD THE MONEY TO

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:51.080
CONNECT OUR SYSTEM TO ANY

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:53.015
POPULATION CENTER. AND WHY THE

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.516
RUSH TO DO THAT. INSTEAD OF

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:55.618
PUTTING ALL THE MONEY THAT WE

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:57.086
CAN'T INTO DOING A TWO TRACK

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:58.520
SYSTEM WE STILL HAVE A ONE TRACK

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.522
SYSTEM IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN BY

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:01.457
THE WAY. ONE TRACK WITH TRAINS

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:04.827
HAVING TO PULL OVER TO PASS EACH

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:07.029
OTHER. SUBOPTIMAL FOR SURE- AND-

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.497
I ALSO WANTED TO ASK MR KELLY

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:10.532
ABOUT THAT CONNECTION. TO A

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.434
STRAIN OR TO OTHER ANOTHER TRAIN

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:14.770
SYSTEM. I'M STILL VERY UNCLEAR

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:16.071
ON THIS BUSINESS PLAN ABOUT

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.539
WHERE THIS TRAIN WHERE THE

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.174
STATION IS GOING TO BE. AND WHO

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:21.110
PAYS FOR CONNECTION. AS FAR AS I

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:22.611
CAN SEE IF THE TRAIN STOPS IN

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:24.313
MERCED AT A STATION THAT'S TO BE

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.414
BUILT BUT THERE'S NO CONNECTION

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.416
TO ANY OTHER TRAIN SYSTEM. AND

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:28.217
HOW LONG IT'S SUPPOSED TO

01:11:28.283 --> 01:11:30.119
OPERATE. FROM OUTSIDE OF

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:31.286
BAKERSFIELD NOT EVEN INTO

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:32.788
DOWNTOWN BAKERSFIELD BUT OUTSIDE

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:34.790
OF BAKERSFIELD. TO A STATION

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:36.191
NUMBER SAID WITH NO CONNECTION

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:38.060
TO ANYTHING ELSE. AND WHAT ARE

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.862
THEIR RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THAT

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:40.429
THEY'RE GOING TO PRESENT AS

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:42.031
REFLECTED THAT REALITY. BECAUSE

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:43.699
THEN WE'RE WAITING TO TRY TO

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:44.733
FIND MORE FUNDING TO CONNECT

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.502
THIS TRYING TO SOMETHING. AND I

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:47.703
BELIEVE THAT TO HAS WOULD HAVE

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.371
UTILITY THIS TRAIN HAS TO GO.

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:51.707
BEYOND MERCED. THEY WON WHEN IT

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:54.810
OPENS NOT DOWN THE LINE NOT IN

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:57.312
FIVE YEARS NOT IN TEN YEARS. SO

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:59.615
MY CONCERN ABOUT THE PROJECT HAS

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:01.250
BEEN THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.351
TO REALLY FOCUS MORE THAN

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:03.886
ANYTHING ON THAT CONNECTION SO

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:05.487
THAT WHATEVER IS RUNNING ON THIS

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:07.389
BEAUTIFUL NEW SECTION O TRACK

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:08.490
SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:10.092
PEOPLE TO WHERE THEY'RE WORKING.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.428
OVER THEY WANT TO GO. NOT TO GET

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:13.762
ON A BUS AND TRAVEL ANOTHER FEW

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.531
MILES TO ANOTHER TRAIN SYSTEM.

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:16.565
THAT MAYBE HAS SERVICE THAT

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:17.666
DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH THIS TRAIN

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.268
SERVICE BUT SOMETHING THAT.

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:22.304
REALLY HAS UTILITY. AND THAT ALL

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:23.906
OF OUR FUNDING SHOULD BE FOCUSED

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:25.507
ON COMPLETING THAT SECTION OF

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:27.676
TRACK WITH TWO TWO TRACKS. MY

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:28.677
LAST QUESTION WILL BE ABOUT THE

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:29.945
ELECTRIFICATION IN THE AND

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.047
THAT'S NOW SOMEHOW FOUND ITS WAY

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:34.316
INTO THIS FEDERAL APPROPRIATION

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.518
. IS AND THIS IS FOR ALEJO. OF

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.587
COURSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO RUN

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:39.188
HIGH SPEED RAIL WITHOUT BEING

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:40.622
ELECTRIFIED THAT'S OBVIOUS BUT

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:42.758
BUT MY QUESTION IS IF WE DO THE

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.993
PRELIMINARY WORK. TO ELECTRIFY

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.562
THE TRACK BUT NOT COMPLETE THAT

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:47.763
UNTIL WE'VE ACTUALLY BOUGHT OUR

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.531
TRAINS INCLUDED OUR SYSTEM. DOES

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:51.333
THAT SORT OF COUNT WITHIN THE

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.901
FEDERAL FUNDING IN OTHER WORDS.

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:53.869
CAN WE TO START THAT

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.904
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT STILL RUN

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:58.207
SOMETHING IN TERM ON THAT TRACK-

01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:00.542
INTO WE COMPLETE OUR SYSTEM OR

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:01.810
DOES IT HAVE TO BE FOR THE

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.078
FEDERAL FUNDING THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:04.413
DO. EVERYTHING EVEN IF YOU'RE

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.748
NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO RUN A

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:07.816
TRAIN OR CONNECT TO ANYTHING SO.

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.952
I'LL WAIT IN HERE AND I'M SORRY

01:13:10.018 --> 01:13:11.720
IF I HAVE TO GO OUT AND COME

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:13.422
BACK BUT- AGAIN I REALLY

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:15.057
APPRECIATE AND I DEFINITELY WANT

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:16.825
TO HEAR FROM MR THOMPSON WHO IS

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:18.694
OUR INDEPENDENT- A SORT OF

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:20.662
ANALYST IN ALL OF THIS- I'D LIKE

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.264
TO HEAR IF HE HAS ANY- ANSWERS

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:24.133

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:28.804
PANELISTS KEEP YOUR ANSWERS AS

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:30.639
CONCISE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:33.876
HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS TO US

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:36.779
THIS MORNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:38.046

THOMPSON. THANK YOU FOR THOSE

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.623
QUESTIONS WHICH I WILL HAVE TO

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:50.325
SAY ARE NOT EASY- THEY REQUIRE A

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:52.494
LITTLE BIT OF THOUGHT FIRST I

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:54.696
THINK MY REACTION IS THAT WHAT

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.265
YOUR QUESTION DOES IS HIGHLIGHT

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.033
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIRECTION FROM

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.103
THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT IT

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.172
WANTS. ARE YOU DO NOT IN THIS

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:05.073
CASE WANT TO DILUTE THE EFFORT

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.942
OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.845
IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO. A MERCED

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:11.947
THE BAKERSFIELD THERE ISN'T

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:14.049
REALLY ANY MONEY TO TALK ABOUT

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.617
SHIFTING OUT OF THE CENTRAL

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:17.452
VALLEY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.188
IT SHOULD REMAIN FOCUSED ON THE

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:21.490
OBJECTIVE OF MERCED THE

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:24.760
BAKERSFIELD. ALL WE ALL

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.662
CONNECTION AT MERCED THIS WAS AN

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.197
ISSUE THAT WAS ISCUSSED IN

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:30.532
DETAIL IN OUR LETTER LAST YEAR

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:32.367
AND IT REMAINS A MATTER OF GREAT

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:35.370
CONCERN. IT INVOLVES STATE

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:36.738
MINING AND STATE COMMITMENT TO

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:39.007
FINISHING YOUR CONNECTION SAID

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:41.577
AND LOCAL COMMITMENT FROM THE US

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:43.145
AND GENERAL KEANE JOINT POWERS

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:45.681
AUTHORITY. BOOSTER PLAN OPERATE

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.282
THAT STATION OPERATE THE

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.418
CONNECTING SERVICES AND UNDER

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:51.353
THE PLANS OF THE AUTHORITY.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.455
ACTUALLY OPERATE UNDER CONTRACT

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:55.791
HI SPEED TRAINS FROM MERCED THAT

01:14:55.858 --> 01:14:57.693
BAKERSFIELD. AND THOSE ARE

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.928
ISSUES WHICH WE SAID THEN- NEED

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:01.697
DID A LOT FOR THE RETENTION OF

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:04.466
CLARIFICATION THAT HAS NOT YET

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:07.202
BEEN DONE SO IT'S A- DESERVES.

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:09.104
SOME AND ALL THAT ALL RIGHT SOME

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.506
ATTENTION ON THAT. I GUESS FINAL

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.175
ELECTRIFICATION A ROLE IN THIS

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:16.411
OFF TO A BRAND OR ALONE BUT- I

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:18.313
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TERMS OF THE

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.116
OF THE FEDERAL. REQUIREMENT FOR

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:23.452
ELECTRIFICATION OF MERCED THE

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:25.954
BAKERSFIELD ART. AND I'M NOT

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:28.023
SURE WHAT OBJECTIVES THE FEDERAL

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.892
GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO SOLICIT

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.860
SATISFIED BY REQUIRING

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:34.329
ELECTRIFICATION. AS AS PART OF

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:37.366
AN AGREEMENT- INDEED YOU COULD

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:40.602
OPERATE HI SPEED DIESEL TRAINS.

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.371
ON THE SEGMENT FOR SOME INTERIM

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.573
PERIOD OF TIME. AND THAT WOULD

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.974
HAVE HOW DO BECAUSE THEY TO

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.443
CONNECT DIRECTLY TO SACRAMENTO

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:50.846
IF YOU WANTED TO DO SO WITHOUT

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:53.649
REQUIRING ANY CHANGE IN OUR SET.

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.584
UP WITH THE SUIT WITH THE

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.586
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY

01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:59.421
INSIST ON ALECTRA EDUCATION

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:01.089
BEFORE COMPLETION OF EVERYTHING

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:03.025
ELSE I DON'T KNOW. THAT WOULD BE

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.893
A MATTER FOR DISCUSSION WITH THE

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.995
BIDEN MINISTRATION BUT- MY

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:08.864
EXPERIENCE THUS FAR IS THAT

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.632
THEY'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TRY

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:11.967
TO WORK WITH THE STATE FOR

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:19.741
ANYTHING. THAT THE STATE WANTS

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.243
TO DO. WHICH INCLUDES BACK TO

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:22.110
THE QUESTION WHAT THE ALLIANCE.

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:23.512
REALLY WANT THE SPEED RAIL OF

01:16:23.578 --> 01:16:25.247
THE- TO DO. I DO WANT TO ADD ONE

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:26.248
OTHER THING- THAT THEY WE CAN

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.850
THE SIZE DATA IS THAT. TO PUT

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:30.819
ONE IS. LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:33.121
COULD INCLUDE A NUMBER OF THINGS

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:38.260
THAT FELL AND HAS MENTIONED- BUT

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:39.161
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.762
BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE AS OF

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:43.231
NOW LOOKS AT THE PROJECT ONCE OR

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:45.133
TWICE A YEAR WITHOUT PEOPLE WHO

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.302
ARE EXPERIENCED IN THE PROJECT

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:48.737
WITHOUT PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD YEARS

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:51.273
OF. CONTINUITY IN OVERSEEING

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.908
ISSUES OF THE PROJECT AND

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.609
WITHOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE FOCUSED

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:56.411
ON THE LARGEST PROJECT THE STATE

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:59.047
IS EVER UNDERTAKEN THAT DESERVES

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:02.985
SOME THOUGHT. WELL I GUESS THE

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:05.387
OTHER THOUGHT IS THAT. HELP

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.656
STABLE INADEQUATE FUNDING FROM

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:09.624
WHATEVER SOURCES THE LEGISLATURE

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.560
DESIGNATES WITHOUT STABLE AND

01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:13.929
ADEQUATE FUNDING YOU'RE ASKING

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:16.331
BRIAN KELLY TO DO SOMETHING THAT

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:19.034
HE CAN'T DO. HE'S GOT TO HE HAS

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.436
TO JUGGLE TOO MANY THINGS AND HE

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:23.238
HAS TOO MANY THINGS THAT HE

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.040
DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN DEPEND

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:27.342
ON. SO AT SOME POINT PART OF THE

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:29.044
LEGISLATURE'S ACTION ON THIS

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:30.846
PROJECT HAS GOT TO BE TO

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.948
ESTABLISH A CLEAR SET OF

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:35.250
OBJECTIVES AND FUNDING THAT IS

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:37.386
ADEQUATE AND STABLE TO ACHIEVE

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:38.587
THOSE OBJECTIVES UNTIL YOU DO

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:41.456
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:42.224
THE SAME KIND OF ISSUES EVERY

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.993
YEAR. OF THAT AS HELEN SAID THAT

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.162
WE'VE OF THOSE OF US WHO HAVE

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:48.096
BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.032
SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE AND I

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:52.067
HANG OUT. THESE ISSUES HAVE COME

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:56.004
UP NEARLY EVERY YEAR AND I

01:17:56.071 --> 01:18:01.443
REALLY NEED TO BE RESOLVED.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:07.449
MISTER CHAIRMAN MAY I. OKAY SO

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:10.952
ON THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- FIRST

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:12.921
WITH RESPECT TO THE SUGGESTION

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:13.822
THAT WE'RE SPENDING MONEY

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:16.291
ELSEWHERE OUTSIDE THE VALLEY OF

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:17.626
LUCK WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUDGET

01:18:17.692 --> 01:18:19.594
THAT WE ESTIMATE WE HAVE BETWEEN

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.430
BOND DOLLARS. THE AVAILABLE

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:23.899
FEDERAL DOLLARS WE ALREADY HAVE

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:25.634
NOT NEW BUT THE AVAILABLE DATA

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.202
DOLLARS WE ALREADY HAVE AND THE

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:28.870
CAP AND TRADE MONEY THAT WE

01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:31.573
ESTIMATE WE HAVE BETWEEN NOW AND

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.307
TWENTY THIRTY WE ARE NOT

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.276
PROPOSING TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:36.111
OUTSIDE OF THE VALLEY. WHAT WE

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:38.080
ARE OBSERVING IS THAT WE'RE AT A

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:40.315
TIME A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE NEW

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.551
FEDERAL DOLLARS HAVE COME IN AT

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.152
A LEVEL OF INVESTMENT HIGHER

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:46.088
THAN WE'VE SEEN IN DECADES. THE

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:47.923
GOVERNOR HAS ADDED A FOURTEEN

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:51.159
POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:51.693
TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.196
PROGRAM. INTO THAT FEDERAL POT

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:55.864
RIGHT NOW. AND SO THERE'S AN

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:57.732
OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS HERE FOR

01:18:57.799 --> 01:19:00.435
US TO PURSUE FEDERAL MONEY. TO

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.204
ELIMINATE THE CONSIDERATION OF

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.472
THE SINGLE TRACK BETWEEN MERCED

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:05.540
AND BAKERSFIELD AND DO A DOUBLE

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:08.243
TRACK. AND TO USE OTHER STATE OR

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:10.545
FEDERAL FUNDS TO ADVANCE WORK

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:12.314
AROUND THE STATE THAT SOME HAVE

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.749
ADVOCATED WE DO. I'M THROUGH

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:16.151
WITH THOSE DOLLARS TO ADVANCED

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:18.587
DESIGN WORK WHERE WE FINISH THE

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:19.988
ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. WE ARE

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:21.623
WORKING ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.459
DOCUMENTS STATEWIDE- FIVE

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:26.561
HUNDRED MILE SEGMENT. AT FOR

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:27.729
FIVE YEARS BEFORE I GOT HERE

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:29.030
THORNY HAD NOT CLEARED THE

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:30.966
RECORD OF DECISION. WE'VE NOW

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:32.734
DONE FOR IN THE LAST TWO YEARS

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:35.103
AND WILL DO TO MORE IN TWENTY

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:36.671
TWENTY TWO. THAT'S SIX SEGMENTS

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:38.907
CLEAR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:40.609
MILES OF THE FIVE MILE SYSTEM WE

01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:42.644
ARE. WE THINK IT IS WISE TO

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:44.212
ADVANCE THE COULD THE DESIGN

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:45.780
WORK IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT AND

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:47.716
WE WOULD HOPE THAT IN THE BUDGET

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:48.650
DISCUSSIONS THIS YEAR. THEY'LL

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:49.784
BE SOME MONEY IDENTIFIED FOR

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:50.986
THAT PURPOSE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN

01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:53.955
ADVOCATED FOR BY SOME OF THE

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:55.390
LEGISLATURE AND WE SUPPORT THAT.

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:56.758
I DON'T HAVE IT WITHIN MY

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:59.327
CURRENT BUDGET TO DO IT BUT I DO

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:01.563
SUPPORT USING ADDITIONAL FUNDS

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.733
TO ADVANCED DESIGN WORK

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:05.233
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NO

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.768
QUESTION ABOUT. SECONDLY ON THE

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.303
WISDOM OF RUSHING FOR TRACKING

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:10.238
SYSTEMS CONTRACT. OR BUYING

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:12.741
TRAINS. FAR FROM RUSHING WE ARE

01:20:12.807 --> 01:20:15.143
DELAY. WE ARE DELAYING THE

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.711
TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT WE

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:18.480
HAVE DONE IT SEVERAL TIMES. AND

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:20.048
WE ARE NOT EVEN CONSIDERING

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:21.583
BUYING TRAINS IN THIS FISCAL

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.852
YEAR UNTIL. THIS CONVERSATION

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:25.854
WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS SUBTLE.

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:27.088
OUR HOPE IS THAT THROUGH THE

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:29.257
BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR. WE

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:30.926
WILL COME OUT OF THIS WITH THE

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.727
CLARITY. ON HOW POLICY MAKERS

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:33.461
WANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:35.997
PROJECT. AND THEN WE WILL REACT

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:38.733
TO THAT. AND WE WILL DETERMINE

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.769
TOGETHER HOW WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:20:40.835 --> 01:20:42.771
ARE WE WHAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:43.738
DO UNDER THE LAW THIS BUSINESS

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:46.174
PLAN. IS TELL YOU HOW WE WOULD

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:47.742
MOVE FORWARD UNDER A CONSTRAINT

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:49.744
BUDGETS. AND ARE CONSTRAINED

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:52.447
BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:53.381
THREE TWENTY FIVE BILLION.

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.116
BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRD.

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.851
THAT'S CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS THE

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:59.054
REMAINING BOND FUNDS. AT THE

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.056
FEDERAL FUNDING WE ALREADY HAVE.

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:03.925
NOT NEW FEDERAL FOR. NEW FEDERAL

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:04.859
FUNDING WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:07.062
THAT. SO WE ARE YOU INTEND TO

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:08.296
PURSUE NEW FEDERAL DOLLARS

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:09.864
BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE. BECAUSE

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:11.199
WE HAVE THE BEST WORKING

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:12.434
RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD WITH THE

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.469
US DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION AND

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.238
THE UP ALREADY IN THE HISTORY OF

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:18.073
THIS PROJECT. WE THINK NOW IS

01:21:18.139 --> 01:21:22.043
THE TIME TO GO SETTLE ISSUES

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:23.378
LIKE ONE TRACK VERSUS TO TRACK.

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:24.713
THE OTHER THING I JUST MENTION

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:25.780
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:27.749
TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT BILL.

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:29.517
BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE DESIGNED

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:31.186
AND YOU NEED TO MOVE. TO

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:32.420
AUTOMATE CONSTRUCTION AS WE

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:34.823
COMPLETE THE CIVIL WORKS. THE C.

01:21:34.889 --> 01:21:38.226
P. FOR CONTRACT WILL BE DONE. AT

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:39.294
THE VERY BEGINNING OF TWENTY

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:41.696
TWENTY THREE. AND SO. THE DESIGN

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:43.531
AND THE EARLY PROCUREMENT OF

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:45.500
MATERIALS WILL BE NECESSARY TO

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:46.801
AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTE TRACKING

01:21:46.868 --> 01:21:48.570
SYSTEMS HOWEVER. IF WE DON'T

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:49.771
KNOW WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:51.673
ELECTRIFIED SYSTEM OR NOT. THEN

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.075
WE SHOULD WAIT. WE SHOULD WAIT

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:56.678
OUR VIEW IS FOR THE AMOUNT OF

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:57.746
MONEY WE'RE SPENDING IN THE

01:21:57.812 --> 01:21:59.247
CENTRAL VALLEY. WE SHOULD HAVE

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:00.315
AN ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:02.917
SYSTEM. WE DID A ALL SIDE BY

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:06.054
SIDE ANALYSIS OF THIS IN TWENTY

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:08.023
NINETEEN WE REPEATED IT IN

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:09.190
TWENTY TWENTY WE SHARED IT WITH

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:10.825
THE LEGISLATURE WE CHATTED WITH

01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:12.360
PEER REVIEW GROUPS. THE PEER

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.728
EVIEW GROUP THAT WE SHARED IT

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.497
WITH SAID IT WAS REASONABLE THAT

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:16.998
WE THINK THAT'S THE BEST

01:22:17.065 --> 01:22:18.800
APPROACH FOR CONSTRAINED BUDGET.

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:21.469
THAT ALSO IS IN LINE WITH WHAT

01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:24.039
PROP ONE A. **** TO DO. SO WE

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.407
WANT TO GET AN OPERATING SEGMENT

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:26.708
GOING ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.543
TRAINS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.278
BENEFIT FROM DOING THAT FROM

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:31.479
RIDERSHIP PERSPECTIVE IN THE

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:33.448
BALLOT. AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:34.783
TO ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK

01:22:34.849 --> 01:22:36.651
EVERYWHERE ELSE SO WE CAN

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:38.586
PREPARE THE NEW SEGMENTS FOR

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:40.255
CONSTRUCTION. AND MAKE SURE WE

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:42.424
DO IT RIGHT UNLIKE THE BEGINNING

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.392
OF THIS PROJECT ON THE BALLOT.

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.728
WE WANT TO GET MORE RISK THE NO

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.064
EARLIER WE WANT TO IDENTIFY THE

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.865
DID THE WHAT EXPAND DESIGN

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:51.933
IDENTIFY THE RIGHT AWAY THAT'S

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.601
NEEDED. WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:56.471
UNDERTAKE THAT WORK UNTIL WE'VE

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:59.074
MOVED THE WORK IN THE VALLEY

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.709
WE'VE GOT A PERCENT BAKERSFIELD

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.577
STRETCH OPERATIONAL OR GOING

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.045
WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AS A

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:05.380
STATE. AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:06.781
HOW TO GET HOW TO ADVANCE THE

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:08.483
WORK BE ON THE BALLOT AND YES IT

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.218
WILL TAKE ORE MONEY AND IT WILL

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:15.957
TAKE MORE TIME. BUT YOU KNOW I.

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:16.758
COME UP WITH A BUSINESS PLAN

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.026
EVERY YEAR. AND I CAN. THE I DO

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:20.128
HAVE FUND. FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:22.597
OF THE VALLEY RIGHT NOW. I DO

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.232
NOT HAVE DENTIFIED FUNDING AND

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:25.567
THAT'S WHAT LIEU THOMPSON IS

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:27.869
THAT SAYING FOR FIVE YEARS MAYBE

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:29.971
LONGER AND SO I'M GIVING YOU A

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:31.639
PLAN OF HOW WE CAN DO THIS

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:34.008
WITHIN OUR TRAIN BUDGET SEGMENT

01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:36.578
BY SEGMENT ARAFAT IS USE THE

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:38.480
ASSETS WERE BUILDING NOW GET THE

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.382
ELECTRIFIED SYSTEM GOING THERE

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:42.083
THERE ARE RIDERSHIP BENEFITS

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:43.852
TRAVEL BENEFITS CONNECTIVITY

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.553
BENEFITS GREENHOUSE GAS

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.789
BENEFITS. WE LAID ALL THOSE OUT

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.191
IN TWENTY NINETEEN AGAIN IN

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:52.093
TWENTY TWENTY WE SUBJECTED TO

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.862
PEER REVIEW AND IT WAS A FIRM.

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:55.296
AND SO THAT IS OUR PROPOSAL

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.432
GOING FORWARD IF THE LEGISLATURE

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:59.134
POLICY MAKERS WANT TO DO

01:23:59.200 --> 01:23:59.634
SOMETHING ELSE WE'LL DO

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.903
SOMETHING ELSE. BUT THAT THAT IS

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.905
WHAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PUT IN A

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:04.773
PLAN HERE IS HOW WE WOULD

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:06.875
PROCEED I DO NOT HAVE MONEY YOU

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:08.843
HAVE TO GET TO THE BAY AREA OR

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.912
INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT BUT

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:13.715
WE CAN ADVANCE THOSE SECTIONS BY

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.683
GETTING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE.

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:16.718
AND DOING ALL OF THE ADVANCED

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:19.154
DESIGN WORK SO WE KNOW MUCH MORE

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.855
BEFORE WE GET THERE AND THAT'S

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:21.623
WHAT OUR THAT'S OUR APPROACH

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.691
ENTAILS TWO OTHER POINTS JUST

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:27.896
AFTER MISTREATMENT. QUESTIONS I

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:28.797
MAKE A BRIEF PLACE. WHY ON THE

01:24:28.863 --> 01:24:30.999
CONNECTION MERCED. LOOK TODAY

01:24:31.065 --> 01:24:32.434
WHETHER OR NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.701
IS OPERATING BETWEEN PERCENT OR

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:35.870
BAKERSFIELD. TODAY WITH THE

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:37.972
EXTENSION OF AS IN THE DOWNTOWN

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:39.073
PERCENT WHICH IS ALREADY FUNDED

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.775
BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.577
HAPPENING. AND SHOULD BE

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:44.045
AVAILABLE TO MERCED AT THE END

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:46.514
OF THE DECADE. BOB THEY'RE GOING

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.650
TO A DIFFERENT STATION IN MERCED

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:50.552
SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM WOULD GO TO.

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:52.253
AND THE CITY OF MERCED AND MOST

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.389
TRANSIT ADVOCATES WOULD SAY WE

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:55.657
ARE TO BUILD A SINGLE STATION IN

01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:57.926
MERCED. FOR ALL OPERATORS TO GO

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:58.760
TO SO WE HAVE BETTER TRANSIT

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.895
CONNECTIVITY. AS GOES TO THE BAY

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:02.831
AREA THE SAN JOAQUIN'S GO TO

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:05.233
SACRAMENTO AND OAKLAND. AND YET

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.968
THE IDEA IS FOR A SINGLE STATION

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:08.803
AND WERE SET. AS WE INDICATED

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:10.872
LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE.

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:13.241
THAT STATION STILL HAS TO BE.

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:15.310
DESIGNED IT CLEARED AND FUNDED.

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:16.244
AND WE DON'T THINK THE HIGH

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:17.579
SPEED RAIL FORTY SHOULD FUND

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:19.614
THAT STATION BY ITSELF BECAUSE

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:22.484
THE BENEFITS INVOLVED. AS IN THE

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.352
SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM WHICH NOW

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:25.253
GETS FUNDING FROM THE STATE OF

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.288
CALIFORNIA TO OPERATE. SO

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:28.723
ALTERNATELY A SINGLE STATION IN

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.725
MERCED IS THE RIGHT DECISIONWE

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.460
AGREE WITH THAT. AND WE THINK

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:33.728
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.697
INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY TO DO

01:25:35.763 --> 01:25:37.165
ALL THE WORK TO GET THAT SINGLE

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:39.634
STATION LOCATED FUNDED AND BELT.

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.736
AND IT'LL BENEFIT RIDERS GOING

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.404
TO OAKLAND. SACRAMENTO AND OTHER

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:45.139
POINTS IN THE BAY AREA. IT WILL

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:49.410
ALSO. IMPROVE CONNECTED IN THE

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:50.178
HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND LASTLY ON

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.513
THE ONLY. QUESTION IN THE

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:52.380
AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:55.884
GOVERNMENT. UP EVEN THE ORIGINAL

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.986
OUR AGREEMENT AS A PRINCIPLE

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:59.654
MATTER SAID THE RESULT OF THESE

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:01.589
FUNDS LIKE TO FIGHT HIGH SPEED

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.525
RAIL SYSTEM ABOUT. AND SO WHAT

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.059
WE GET BACK WITH THE TRUMP

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:07.262
ADMINISTRATION. BUT PROPOSED TO

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:08.830
RESCIND FEDERAL DOLLARS THIS

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:11.099
PROJECT AT AND WE NEGOTIATED

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:13.234
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- HOW

01:26:13.301 --> 01:26:15.937
TO GET THOSE DOLLARS BACK. THE

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:16.971
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVESTMENT WAS

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.339
STILL THE SAME THE LECTURE BY

01:26:18.406 --> 01:26:19.607
HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM IS

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:21.609
OPERATING ABOUT SO THE AGREEMENT

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:24.512
SAYS THAT. NOW IF CALIFORNIA AS

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:26.981
A STATE THE SIZE. WE'RE NOT

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:27.949
GONNA DO ELECTRIFIED IN THE

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.617
VALLEY THE START IT'S JUST A

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:31.085
MATTER OF LIKE TO DO ELECTRIFIED

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:31.986
EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT I DON'T HAVE

01:26:32.053 --> 01:26:34.389
MONEY. FOR IT SO IF WE DON'T DO

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:35.823
ELECTRIFIED SYSTEM OPERATING IN

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:37.592
THE VALLEY NOW YOU HAVE TO GO

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:39.260
BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:41.362
AS A STATE AND FIGURE OUT IF

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:43.765
THAT'S OKAY. AND THEY'LL HAVE TO

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:44.732
THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE A JUDGMENT

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:46.367
ABOUT THE- BUT- CAN. SINCE THE

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:47.802
BEGINNING OF THE ARE FUNDS.

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:49.604
THROUGH THE RECENT DOCUMENT IS

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:51.606
FOR LIKE TO FIVE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.041
SYSTEM OPERATING CALIFORNIA WITH

01:26:53.107 --> 01:26:55.043
THE FEDERAL MONEY THEY KEPT. WE

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:56.377
SEE GREAT BENEFITS TO THAT IN

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:58.313
THE VALLEY AS THE ORIGINAL AND

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:00.281
FIRST BUILDING BLOCK. WHICH WILL

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.250
EXTEND. FROM THERE BUT THAT'S

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:03.851
THAT'S WHY IT'S IN THE

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:05.320
AGREEMENT. THAT WE THINK IT'S

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:06.054
CONSISTENT WITH WHERE THE

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:06.788
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:09.824
BETTER. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:11.893
RESPONSE. YOUR TURN WE- WOULD

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.394
YOU LIKE ME TO ADD ON AS WELL

01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:15.063
AND MISTER CHAIR. IF YOU CAN DO

01:27:15.129 --> 01:27:17.732
SO VERY BRIEFLY WERE RAPIDLY

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:19.334
RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK CARE. I

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.037
APOLOGIZE AND JUST A FEW CLICKS

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:24.539
. I'M WITH REGARD TO THE

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:25.506
SPENDING OUT ON OTHER PARTS

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:26.507
OUTSIDE OF MERCED TO

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:28.977
BAKERSFIELD- AS WAS MENTIONED BY

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:32.647
AND BY MISTER KELLY- THE

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.282
AUTHORITY WANTS TO DANCE DESIGN

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:36.417
OUTSIDE OF THAT OF THAT MERCED

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:38.419
TO BAKERSFIELD AND YOU KNOW

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:39.554
THAT'S A PROBABLY IMPORTANT

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:40.455
THING IF YOU'RE REALLY COMMITTED

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:41.589
TO DOING WORK OUTSIDE OF

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:43.124
REJECTED A CONCEALED THAT'S

01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:44.292
CURRENTLY NOT BUDGETED AS WAS

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:45.760
MENTIONED IT'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:46.394
MILLION DOLLARS THAT THAT THEY

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:48.396
EXPECTED TO COST TO DO THAT

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:49.564
ADVANCED DESIGN. THAT'S NOT IN

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:51.666
THE BUDGET SO EITHER WE HAVE YET

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.001
FEDERAL FUNDS TO DO THAT AND

01:27:53.067 --> 01:27:54.902
MAYBE THEY MATCH THIS THAT WITH

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:55.870
THEM STATE BENEFITS AND CLEAR

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.039
WHAT AND THIS WOULD BE SO- I

01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.841
THINK IT IS IT IS A QUESTION I

01:27:59.907 --> 01:28:00.942
MEAN IT'S THEORETICALLY EVEN

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:02.510
THOUGH IT'S NOT IN THE BUDGET

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:03.878
PLAN HE'S ALREADY COULD USE SOME

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.146
OF THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS TO

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.214
MATCH FEDERAL FUNDS. ARE

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.949
POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW PERHAPS

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:09.350
OTHER STATES WHICH IS TO BE USED

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:10.485
FOR THAT BUT THAT'S NOT

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:12.320
CURRENTLY BUDGETED- AND SO TO

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:13.721
THE EXTENT FUNDS WERE USED FOR

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:14.822
THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD THAT

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:16.524
WORK YOU ARE CURRENTLY THIRD

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:17.725
DESIGNATED FOR MERCED

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:18.860
BAKERSFIELD THAT COULD INCREASE

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:20.094
THAT FUNDING GAP SO THAT WAS OUR

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:21.729
POINT THERE ON THE TRACKING

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:23.264
SYSTEMS WHAT HE'D WANT TO COMMIT

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:24.966
TO THAT BEFORE AND THE LINE

01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:26.267
CONNECTED TO POPULATION CENTERS.

01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:27.568
JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT ONE I

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:28.803
THINK ONE IMPORTANT

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:29.470
CONSIDERATION OUT WHEN YOU WANT

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:30.838
TO DO TRACKING SYSTEMS IF YOU

01:28:30.905 --> 01:28:32.140
WANNA MAKE SURE YOU GOT ENOUGH

01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:33.274
OF THE RIGHT AWAY AND THE CIVIL

01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:35.143
WORKS IS REALLY FAR ENOUGH ALONG

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:36.944
THAT YOU DON'T START LOOKING

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:38.346
TRACK I MEAN I KNOW THE

01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:40.448
ORIGINAL. RP THERE HAD LAYING

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:42.684
TRACK IN IN VERY SMALL SEGMENTS

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:44.686
LIKE LESS THAN TEN MILES-

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:46.387
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:48.356
GONNA GET ALL OF THE WORK THAT

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.924
ENHANCE FACT THAT TO CHALLENGE

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.292
LIKE BACK BACK WE REALLY

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:53.027
PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO BE DOING

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:54.262
WE WANT TO WAIT MAKE SURE WE AT

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:56.330
LEAST HAVE THE CIVIL WORKS IN

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:57.632
GOOD SHAPE BEFORE STARTLING

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:59.701
TRACK THAT WE DON'T END UP IN A

01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:01.002
SITUATION WHERE- YOU KNOW WHERE

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:02.437
WE HAVE TO LAY CLAIMS- AND

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:03.738
THAT'S BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR THE

01:29:03.805 --> 01:29:05.740
STATE IN THE PAST- SO I THINK

01:29:05.807 --> 01:29:06.774
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.843
YOU. TO THINK ABOUT ALSO TWO

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:11.412
TRACKS- ARE A VERY VALUABLE

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:14.515
AGAIN AS MR KELLY MENTIONED SO

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:16.684
I'M GETTING RESPECT TO PROBABLY

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:18.486
NEED FEDERAL FUNDING TO DO THAT

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:19.921
SO DO WE WANT TO RELEASE THE

01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:30.531
CONTRACT AWARDED TRACKING.

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:31.566
SYSTEMS CONTRACT BEFORE WE NO IF

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:32.767
THAT FEDERAL. IS AND THERE INTO

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:34.335
THE- WHERE THE- WORDING THAT

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:35.303
COULD. LATER THIS YEAR TO CLEAR

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:37.371
THAT KNOW ABOUT. FUNDING THAT.

01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:38.272
SO THAT I THINK I KNOW KEY FOR.

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:41.876
TO THINK. THEIR CERTAINLY- OF.

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:43.311
YOU KNOW THERE ARE NONE. OF KEY

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:44.979
THING ALSO I DO A PRE. CERTAINLY

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.681
THE AT THE WORD TO LAY THE TRACK

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:47.315
INSIST CONTRACT SOMEWHERE

01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:47.949
ALREADY. BUT WOULD NOW- KNOW.

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.150
AGAIN THAT THAT. THAT THAT WE

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:50.718
TALK ABOUT THAT GRANT AGREEMENT.

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:51.586
EFFECTIVELY CONNECT THE STATE'S

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:53.087
ELECTRIFICATION SO ON ONE HAND

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:54.122
THROUGH DIFFERING THAT ACTION

01:29:54.188 --> 01:29:56.257
BUT THEN. I'M YOU REALLY.

01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:57.892
PREVIOUS GRANT AGREEMENTS REALLY

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:58.693
HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.928
ELECTRIFICATION. AND THIS GRANT

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:01.729
AGREEMENT HOW THAT WITH THE

01:30:01.796 --> 01:30:03.531
TROOPS. IN MANY PLACES

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:06.033
THROUGHOUT THE AGREEMENT SO-

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.201
AGAIN IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER WE

01:30:07.268 --> 01:30:09.403
COULD KIND OF- YOU RENEGOTIATE

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:10.304
WITH THAT WITH THE FEDERAL

01:30:10.371 --> 01:30:11.539
GOVERNMENT. OR WHETHER WE DO YOU

01:30:11.606 --> 01:30:12.473
KNOW WHAT WHAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:13.441
HAVE TO REDDING ELECTRIFIED

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:15.476
TRAINS. I HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THE

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:18.146
DETAILS AGAIN BUT- BUT IT REALLY

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:19.680
IS A CHANGE IT WAS VERY NOTABLE

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:20.681
BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS GRANT

01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:21.549
AGREEMENT IN THIS ONE.

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.417
ELECTRIFICATION WITH ADAM YOU

01:30:23.484 --> 01:30:24.285
KNOW NUMEROUS TIMES THROUGHOUT

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:25.520
THE DOCUMENT. AND THEN JUST

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.588
FINALLY- ON THE CONNECTION TO

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:28.890
MERCED I THINK IT'S CRITICAL.

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:30.291
THAT WE HAVE A GOOD CONNECTION

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:31.192
RESET AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:33.561
RIGHT NOW. THE PLAN IS. THAT THE

01:30:33.628 --> 01:30:35.496
CURRENT STATIONS WOULD BE THIRTY

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:36.664
THREE OF THEM RIGHT ONE

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:38.566
CONSERVING THE SAN JOAQUIN. ONE

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:39.534

HE'S TRYING TO COME INTO YET A

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:42.370
THIRD ONE. I'M SO I THINK

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:43.738
EVERYONE AGREED THAT THAT

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:45.106
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WE NEED IT TO

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:46.774
BE ONE STATION. RIGHT NOW.

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:54.081
EXTENDING. OUR HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:55.449
WE WILL HAVE TO EXTEND. TO GET

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:57.385
TO THAT PROPOSED A STATION AND

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:58.019
THEN THE SAME WORKING WITH TO

01:30:58.085 --> 01:30:58.986

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:03.591
CAUGHT. SO AGAIN THEY WANT YOU.

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:04.492

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.394
THEY WANT TO DO YOU THEY WANT TO

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:07.428
EXTEND NORTH TO GET TO THE

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:08.362
STATION ASU'S PLANNING THAT'S

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:10.097
NOT IN THE BUDGET YET. THEY'RE

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:11.365
ALL THESE PIECES THEY WANTED YOU

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:12.867
DOUBLE TRACKS IT'S NOT REALLY

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:15.269
THAT THE- BUDGET BUT- AGAIN IT'S

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:16.470
NOT CLEAR BACK BEFORE. YOU HAVE

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:18.072
AN OPENING FOR THEIR A LOT OF

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:19.540
PIECES OUT THERE. IMPORTANT

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:21.175
PIECES OF THE PROJECT TO MAKE

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.510
THE PROJECT WORK REALLY WELL BUT

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:24.979
AGAIN AS MR KELLY MENTIONED. THE

01:31:25.046 --> 01:31:26.080
AUTHORITY REALLY HAS VERY

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.316
CONSTRAINED FUNDING RIGHT AND

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:29.217
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT

01:31:29.283 --> 01:31:30.184
ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:32.153
NEEDED. TO REALLY MAKE THAT

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.822
STATION. B. AS GOOD A CONNECTION

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.991
AS POSSIBLE TO REALLY MAKE THAT.

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:38.159
DON'T YOU KNOW DOUBLE TRACKING

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:40.161
HAPPENED. TO DO THAT AGAINST THE

01:31:40.228 --> 01:31:41.362
FINE WORK AND THAT'S CERTAINLY

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:42.597
TO DO OTHER WORK OUT TO PAY FOR

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:44.599
SUCH A BAKERSFIELD- SO I KNOW

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:45.733
THAT WAS VERY QUICK BUT

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.001
HOPEFULLY THAT WAS. THE

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:49.937
PREFERRED IT- BUT- ANY OTHER

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:56.844

OVERSIGHT ON TOP THE AGENCY-

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:14.829
JUST WANT TO START WITH MISTER

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:16.464
THOMPSON I REALLYAPPRECIATED

I'M TALKING. ABOUT TWO

01:32:24.538 --> 01:32:26.507
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROJECTS.

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:29.210
SO- SOMEONE FROM. USER FRANCISCO

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:30.311
HIGH SPEED RAIL VERY IMPORTANT

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:31.812
TO US WHEN WE HAVE A STATION

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:33.414
THAT WE'VE ALREADY BUILT OUT

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:35.082
THAT'S WAITING FOR A TRAIN. I

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:36.217
FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT DURING

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:38.219
MY TENURE LEGISLATURE I'VE SEEN

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:40.388
THE- THE REBUILDING OF THE BAY

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:41.756
BRIDGE AS WELL AS OUR NEW

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:43.357
TRANSBAY TERMINAL SERVING THE

01:32:43.424 --> 01:32:45.927
EAST BAY. OF WHICH THERE IS AN

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:48.162
EMPTY SHELL OF A TRAIN STATION

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:50.031
WAITING TO BE BUILT OUT FOR. A

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:54.468
HIGH SPEED RAIL AT SOME POINT.

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:56.103
SO GORGEOUS GOING TO- MR ARE.

01:32:56.170 --> 01:32:57.471
MISTER THOMPSON FOR A SECOND

01:32:57.538 --> 01:33:00.975
JUST. COULD COULD YOU- IF YOU DO

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:02.977
WOULD YOU HAD ADVISED US TO HAVE

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:05.680
SOME SORT OF ONGOING OVERSIGHT

01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:07.248
WITH MORE EXPERTS TO MORE

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:11.519
EXPERTISE IT SEEMS LIKE. WE NEED

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:13.454
TO HAVE A PROBLEM MUCH DEEPER

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:15.990
DISCUSSION WITH MR KELLY THE

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:17.792
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND REALLY

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:21.295
FLESHING OUT WHAT THIS WHAT

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:24.198
REALISTICALLY. IT CAN BE DONE

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.433
WITH THE SORT OF FORTY AND I

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:27.368
THINK IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:28.135
DISCUSSION SEEM TO HAPPEN

01:33:28.202 --> 01:33:30.237
SPORADICALLY BUT NOT WITH THE

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:31.372
CONSISTENCY THAT'S NEEDED TO

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:34.075
REALLY FLESH OUT OF PLANS I WAS

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:35.776
HOPING TO GET YOUR ADVICE

01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:36.544
BECAUSE HE SEEMED. YOUR REPORT

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:37.611
WAS EXTREMELY THOUGHTFUL BUT

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.780
ALSO- JUST READING BETWEEN THE

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:43.117
LINES SEEMED RATHER PESSIMISTIC

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:44.285
TO AT THAT THAT THAT THE SAME

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:51.492
POINT. ALL WE HAVE SAID SINCE HE

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:53.728
I SAW HER FIRST REPORTS ON THE

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:55.696
PROJECT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:57.832
NEEDS TO DEVOTE MORE ATTENTION

01:33:57.898 --> 01:34:01.736
AND MORE RESOURCES TO CONTINUING

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:03.804
OVERSIGHT OF THE PROJECT. THE

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.973
PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS NO

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.975
DEDICATED STAFF OF PEOPLE I

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:10.277
DON'T KNOW THAT IT REQUIRES A

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:12.179
LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BUT A-

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:14.548
DEDICATED NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WITH

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:16.550
ACCESS TO ALL OF THE INFORMATION

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:18.919
THEY NEED WHO CAN ADVISE THE

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:21.689
LEGISLATURE YEAR AFTER YEAR ON

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:23.691
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE PROJECT

01:34:23.758 --> 01:34:26.360
INSTEAD WHAT WE'VE HAD IS

01:34:26.427 --> 01:34:28.629
HEARINGS ONCE A YEAR OF

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:30.464
DIFFERENT PEOPLE MANY TIMES ON

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:32.800
THE DIFFERENT HEARINGS. AND NO

01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:36.170
SENSE OF CONTINUITY OR HER DEATH

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:39.874
IN THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW OF

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.108
THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE- BY

01:34:41.175 --> 01:34:43.110
ANY MEASURE THIS IS THE LARGEST

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:44.779
PROJECT THE STATE HAS EVER

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:46.614
UNDERTAKEN AND THAT'S LIKELY TO

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.682
BE THE LARGEST PROJECT THE STATE

01:34:48.749 --> 01:34:51.819
EVER UNDERTAKES. SO IT DESERVES

01:34:51.886 --> 01:34:55.256
THE MORE REVIEW MORE ATTENTION

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:57.758
AND MORE UNDERSTANDING. ON THE

01:34:57.825 --> 01:34:59.794
PART OF THE LEGISLATURE OF WHAT

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.729
THE PROPOSAL'S MEANING OF WHAT

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:04.298
THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT IS AND

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.933
WHAT THE RISKS ARE IN A

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.469
REALISTIC WAY- THIS COULD BE

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:10.704
DONE EITHER AS WE DIDN'T WE

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:13.007
SUGGESTED POSSIBLY A SPECIALIZED

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:15.309
STAFF WITHIN THE L. A. O. BUT

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:17.011
THERE MAY BE MANY OTHER WITH.

01:35:17.078 --> 01:35:19.313
COMP WHICH THIS ON AMTRAK FOR

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.215
EXAMPLE HAS AN INTERNAL

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:23.984
INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT REPORT TO

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:26.087
THE CONGRESS ON ON THE ISSUES

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:27.888
AND AMTRAK THAT THE INSPECTOR

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:29.156
GENERAL CONSIDERS TO BE

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:31.792
IMPORTANT FOR ON ISSUES THAT THE

01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:34.595
CONGRESS HAS ASKED THE INSPECTOR

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:36.230
GENERAL TO ANALYZE FOR THEM.

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:37.598
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.834
WAYS TO DO THIS THE MAIN

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:42.937
EMPHASIS IS ON IMPROVED AND

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:45.773
CONTINUING LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.775
OF THE PROJECT I BELIEVE IN THE

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:49.176
INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:52.680
SOMETHING. YOU WOULD ONLY NEED

INSPECTOR GENERAL SO I THINK A

01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:00.087
REALLY GOOD IDEA. WE HAVE ONE

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:01.589

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:04.391
WOULD SAY THAT ONE OFFICES WORK

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:06.727
IN THAT ONE AREA HAS REALLY-

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:08.796
BEEN ONE OF THE ONLY BRIGHT

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:10.531
SPOTS IN THAT SYSTEM I WOULD SAY

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:12.399

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:45.526
WOULD REQUIRE THAT EVERY THING

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:49.263
GO RIGHT. OF EXPERIENCE WHICH WE

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:52.266
HAVE NOT HAD TO DATE. SO THERE

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:54.368
IS A RISK AND I WOULD NOT BE

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:56.537
CONFIDENT THAT WITH THE EXISTING

01:37:56.604 --> 01:38:00.140
MONEY THAT BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:01.976
CAN BE COMPLETED THAT WOULD

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:04.178
DESTROY FEDERAL MONEY OF COURSE

01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:06.347
BROUGH CHANGE THAT. WHAT WE NEED

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:08.249
TO ADD AND I DID SAY TODAY AND

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:10.918
BRIAN ALSO AGREED. THAT GETTING

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:12.987
OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S

01:38:13.053 --> 01:38:15.956
GOING TO REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:18.025
SOURCE OF NEW MONEY THAT HASN'T.

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:20.361
TRIED YET. THANK YOU I'D

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:21.929

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:24.265
PUTTING- PUTTING A SOME BALL IN

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:25.733
OUR COURT WHICH IS A THAT WE

01:38:25.799 --> 01:38:27.101
HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WE'RE

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:28.869
COMMITTED TO AS A LEGISLATURE.

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:30.271
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WORKING WITH

01:38:30.337 --> 01:38:31.505
THE AUTHORITY IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:32.806
OFFICE HOW TO HOW TO FIND AND

01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:35.342
PAY FOR THIS- AND THAT THERE ARE

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:36.510
THERE ARE YOU AGREE WITH YOU

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:38.946
THAT THERE PROBABLY DOES NEED TO

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.447
BE A CLEARER. MESSAGE COMING OUT

01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:41.682
OF THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:43.484
WHAT WE'D LIKE TO KNOW A NUMBER

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:44.318
OF US REPRESENT OUR OWN

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:46.053
DISTRICTS AND THEIR THOUGHTS IN

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.354
THIS AREA BUT I DON'T KNOW I

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:48.789
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU I KNOW THAT

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:50.624
THERE IF THERE IS ONE Q. SET OF.

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:53.794
LEGISLATIVE THOUGHT- SO DON'T GO

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:56.730
JUST MISTER KELLY JUST KIND OF

01:38:56.797 --> 01:38:58.198
PIGGYBACKING ON. MISTER MISTER

01:38:58.265 --> 01:38:59.667
THOMPSON'S POINT OF VIEW WOULD

01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:01.201
YOU AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:03.704
THAT- IN ORDER TO FINISH THE

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:05.472
CURRENT PROJECT WE'RE GONNA NEED

01:39:05.539 --> 01:39:08.709
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING. WELL

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:11.578
AS WE ARE IN LET ME JUST CHECK A

01:39:11.645 --> 01:39:13.881
COUPLE THINGS FIRST- ONE THING

01:39:13.947 --> 01:39:16.116
THAT LIEU THOMPSON HAS BEEN SPOT

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:17.951
ON FROM FROM DAY ONE I CAN.

01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:19.820
THINK WE CONCUR WITH. YOU ARE

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.588
OUR ONLY SOURCE OF ONGOING

01:39:21.655 --> 01:39:23.023
FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT RIGHT

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:25.159
NOW IS CAP AND TRADE FUNDING

01:39:25.225 --> 01:39:26.093
INTO EVERYTHING ELSE IS ONE

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.996
TIME. BOND DOLLARS WHAT TIME

01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:30.731
FEDERAL FUNDING. WHEN WE CAN GET

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.466
- BE ONGOING STABLE SOURCES CAP

01:39:32.533 --> 01:39:34.668
AND TRADE AND CAP AND TRADE HAS

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:36.236
HAD MOMENTS OF VOLATILITY. AND

01:39:36.303 --> 01:39:38.405
SO THE NUMBER ONE RISK THAT WE

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:40.174
IDENTIFIED IN THIS BUSINESS

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.876
PLAN. FOR ANYTHING THAT WE'RE

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:44.411
GOING TO DO IS A FUNDING RISK.

01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:46.980
WHAT WE HAVE ADVOCATED IN FOUR

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:49.283
CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS. THAT THE

01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:50.818
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BE

01:39:50.884 --> 01:39:53.687
EXTENDED TO THE COMPLETION DATES

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:56.090
AND THE A PROGRAMMATIC BATES OF

01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:58.058
THE BENEFITS OF THAT PROGRAM TO

01:39:58.125 --> 01:39:59.159
TWENTY FIFTY. OR WE ASKED HIM

01:39:59.226 --> 01:40:00.728
REQUESTED THAT WE BE ABLE TO

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:02.529
FINANCE AGAINST THOSE PLANS

01:40:02.596 --> 01:40:04.498
WOULD YOU BRING MONEY FORWARD SO

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:05.265
I DID YOU KNOW FUNDING

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:07.468
STABILIZATION IS A KEY PART OF

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:10.404
WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE ADVOCATING

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:11.572
FOR AND WHAT WE HAVE ADVOCATED

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:13.374
FOR. R. THE HARDEST PART OF MY

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.411
JOB AMONG MANY DIFFICULTIES. IS

01:40:17.478 --> 01:40:19.980
TRYING TO DEFEND TO FOLKS. THAT

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:21.482
I SOMEHOW HAVE FUNDING TO DO IT

01:40:21.548 --> 01:40:24.118
ALL. I DON'T. NOT QUITE CANDID

01:40:24.184 --> 01:40:26.653
ABOUT THAT. I HAVE A WE HAVE

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.056
ESTIMATED A BUDGET WE HAVE TO

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.024
TWENTY THIRD. AND WE THINK THAT

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:32.693
WE HAVE ESTIMATED WHAT WE CAN DO

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.595
WITH THAT. AND WE THINK IT GETS

01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:36.130
AN OPERATING RUN GOING TO THE

01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:38.565
VALLEY THE KEY RISK IS A FUNDING

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:41.435
RISK. BECAUSE CAP AND TRADE HAS

01:40:41.502 --> 01:40:42.603
BEEN VOTER. AND I WILL BE NEW

01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:44.471
WILL MORE I WILL LIKELY NEED NEW

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:46.039
FEDERAL MONEY TO MAKE SURE I CAN

01:40:46.106 --> 01:40:48.075
DO THAT AS A DOUBLE TRACK. AND

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:50.444
WHAT THAT IS NOT A NEW OR

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:51.678
SURPRISE. WE INDICATED THAT LAST

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:54.081
YEAR. AND SAID YOU KNOW BECAUSE

01:40:54.148 --> 01:40:55.282
OF BUDGET CONSTRAINTS WE

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:56.784
CONSIDER A SINGLE TRACK BUT A

01:40:56.850 --> 01:40:58.252
DOUBLE TRACK. WILL TAKE

01:40:58.318 --> 01:40:59.920
ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN FEDERAL

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:01.889
FUNDS IS A GOOD PLACE TO GO. AND

01:41:01.955 --> 01:41:03.757
SO OUR OPPONENTS OF THE QUESTION

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:06.727
BUT- BUT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY YEAH

01:41:06.794 --> 01:41:08.595
HE'S RIGHT THE VOLATILITY OF ARE

01:41:08.662 --> 01:41:11.732
FIGHTING TO. GET BIGGEST

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:12.599
CIGARETTES AND THE LIMITATIONS.

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:13.801
NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK

01:41:13.867 --> 01:41:16.036
I THINK. THE CHURCH ADDRESS I

01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:18.105
THINK YOU'RE THE ONE BY TAKE

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:19.440
AWAY WITH. MISTER THOMPSON I

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:22.242
TOTALLY AGREE WITH HIM IS- IT I

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:24.011
WOULD EVEN SAY THE- BEYOND THE

01:41:24.077 --> 01:41:25.312
LEGISLATURE NOT BE ON THE SAME

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:27.915
PAGE THE ASSEMBLY THE SENATE ARE

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:31.552
ON THE SAME PAGE- AND- YOU KNOW.

01:41:31.618 --> 01:41:32.653
YOU IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON

01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:35.756
THE SAME PAGE WITH US AND- IF WE

01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:38.192
WOULD LIKE THIS PROJECT TO GO

01:41:38.258 --> 01:41:39.993
FORWARD I THINK WE DO NEED TO

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.562
TAKE MISTER THOMPSON'S DEVICE.

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:44.364
GET TOGETHER- TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:45.499
WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE THAT

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:47.568
DISCUSSION AND YOU AND I HAVE

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:48.135
TALKED ABOUT THAT DISCUSSION

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:49.369
EVEN GOING BACK TO LAST YEAR.

01:41:49.436 --> 01:41:51.972
THE DISCUSSION HASN'T HAPPENED-

01:41:52.039 --> 01:41:54.408
THERE THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:56.143
THERE IS NO AGREEMENT THERE USE.

01:41:56.210 --> 01:41:58.479
THAT HASN'T EVEN BEEN A- OUTSIDE

01:41:58.545 --> 01:42:00.881
OF THESE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS A-

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:03.851
DISCUSSION REALLY. ABOUT WHAT IS

01:42:03.917 --> 01:42:06.086
THE YOU KNOW THE STATE'S LONG

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:07.354
TERM VISION AND I'VE MET WITH

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:08.655
PARTS OF THE STATE I MEAN.

01:42:08.722 --> 01:42:09.857
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT LET

01:42:09.923 --> 01:42:12.025
LEGISLATURE YOUR YOUR BODY YOUR

01:42:12.092 --> 01:42:14.761
BOARD. MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS

01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:16.296
WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO IT I

01:42:16.363 --> 01:42:17.931
THINK YOUR- YOUR YOUR FRUSTRATED

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:19.466
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GETTING. A

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:21.068
FUNDING COMMITMENT. AND THE

01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:22.803
LEGISLATORS ON WILLING TO GIVE

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:25.172
YOU A FUNDING COMMITMENT BECAUSE

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:26.974
WE HAVEN'T SIGNED OFF ON A PLAN

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.977
. AND SO I THINK IT'S VERY

01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:31.311
COMMON THIS IS A VERY LARGE

01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:33.113
PROJECT MR THOMPSON'S RIGHT A

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.147
LOT OF MOVING PARTS LOT

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:36.316
UNCERTAINTY. THAT IS THE-

01:42:36.383 --> 01:42:38.151
BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AT

01:42:38.218 --> 01:42:42.356
THIS. TIME SO I THINK IF YOU. IN

01:42:42.422 --> 01:42:43.423
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE WANT

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:44.691
THIS PROJECT BEFORE I THINK YOU

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:49.129
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO- SIT DOWN.

01:42:49.196 --> 01:42:50.364
WITH OUR HOUSE THAT DOWN WITH

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.765
THE SENATE CAN REALLY HAMMER

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:53.600
THIS OUT I THINK WE HAVE TO DO

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:56.503
IT FRANKLY TOGETHER- EURO YOU

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:58.238
OTHERWISE YOU COULD I THINK YOUR

01:42:58.305 --> 01:43:00.040
YOUR FAIR YOU'RE COMPLETELY FAIR

01:43:00.107 --> 01:43:02.175
TO SAY HEY. I THINK A COMMITMENT

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:03.377
I'M GONNA DO WHAT I CAN

01:43:03.443 --> 01:43:05.078
WHAT I GOT THAT'S ALL I CAN DO

01:43:05.145 --> 01:43:06.313
AND I THINK AND I THINK THAT'S

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:07.281
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO SOME

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:09.182
EXTENT I THINK THAT'S A VERY

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:10.651
FAIR STATEMENT- WE ON THE OTHER

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:12.452
HAND CAN EXPECT ANY MORE ANY

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:15.355
LESS. AND LESS WE COMMIT A

01:43:15.422 --> 01:43:16.790
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING BUT

01:43:16.857 --> 01:43:18.325
AGAIN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:19.826
TO COMMIT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:22.262
WE'RE COMMITTING TO DOUBT. FOR

01:43:22.329 --> 01:43:24.331
ME PERSONALLY FOR MY DISTRICT

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:26.400
FOR MY CITY I THINK WE CONTINUE

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:29.603
TO BE- ARE. FULLY COMMITTED TO

01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:30.904
THIS VISION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:31.772
THIS CONNECTION FROM SAN

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:33.707
FRANCISCO TO LA I FOR ONE WOULD

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:34.808
LOVE NOTHING BETTER TO BE ABLE

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.476
TO. HOP ON A TRAIN IN DOWNTOWN

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:38.545
SAN FRANCISCO AND END UP IN IN

01:43:38.612 --> 01:43:39.580
DOWNTOWN LA YOU KNOW A FEW HOURS

01:43:39.646 --> 01:43:42.349
LATER- SO HAVING SAID THAT THAT

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:43.784
THE VISION IS SOMETHING THAT.

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:45.752
YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY REMAIN

01:43:45.819 --> 01:43:47.387
COMMITTED TO I KNOW OUR OUR

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:49.256
REGION STANDS FAIRLY COMMITTED

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:51.158
TO THAT BUT- I FEEL LIKE I'M IN

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:52.593
THE MINORITY MY CAUCUS AND ALSO

01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:54.161
I THINK I'M IN THE MINORITY IN

01:43:54.227 --> 01:43:55.662
THE STATE AT THIS POINT- SO. I

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.598
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO

01:43:57.664 --> 01:43:58.532
DO. I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:00.734
CHAIRS LEADERSHIP AND REALLY

TRYING TO KEEP KEEP THE BALL

01:44:01.568 --> 01:44:03.804
MOVING- ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE

01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:06.473
BUT I REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE-

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.241
ALL OF US WHO WHO CARE ABOUT

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:09.276
THIS PROJECT AND WE ALL NEED TO

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:10.644
KIND OF SIT DOWN AND HAMMER OUT

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:12.346
A LOT OF THESE. DETAILS AND

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:13.647
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HER DOCTOR

ON THAT- AS WE- CONCLUDES. OUR

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:22.889
HEARING TODAY I DO HAVE AN

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:25.559

BED IN BUILDING SO- AS SOMEONE

IN MY COMMUNITY BAKERSFIELD-

01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:28.955
CERTAINLY- THIS IS. A BIG DEAL

01:45:29.022 --> 01:45:31.058
AND- OVERSIGHT IS NECESSARY I

MAY COME TO A DIFFERENT

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:37.798
CONCLUSION. BUT I THINK MORE

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:39.366
OVERSIGHT IS COMPLETE NECESSARY

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:41.068
AND- I HUMBLY REQUEST MAYBE WE

01:45:41.134 --> 01:45:43.770
HAVE AN ADDITIONAL- HEARING MAY

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:45.172
BE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE-

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:47.174
ON THE ON GOING TO THE SPECIFICS

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.143
OF HIGH SPEED RAIL- BUT- I JUST

01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:51.478
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND MY

01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:52.345
QUESTIONS ARE ARE DIRECTED TO

01:45:52.412 --> 01:45:54.347
THE L. L. BUT- I FIND IT VERY

01:45:54.414 --> 01:45:55.549
INTERESTING AND I WOULD

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:56.683
HIGHLIGHT THIS TO MEMBERS IS

01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:58.585
THAT. WHAT SHE SAID IN HER

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:01.021
TESTIMONY WAS THAT HE- REPORTS

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:03.256
TEN YEARS AGO HIGHLIGHTED. THESE

01:46:03.323 --> 01:46:05.992
ISSUES AND THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED.

01:46:06.059 --> 01:46:07.694
AND I'VE SAID THIS IN THIS

01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:08.729
COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:10.063
IN THE PAST THAT THE ONLY

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:11.798
PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:16.470
PAST BEHAVIOR AND SO WE EXPECT.

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:17.237
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:18.405
CHANGE SOMEHOW. WELL SOMETHING

01:46:18.472 --> 01:46:19.139
SOME EXTERNAL FORCE HAS TO BE

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:21.541
PLACED ON IT. AND AND AS THE

01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:23.877
CHAIRMAN SHOULD BE FOR- AND OUR

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:25.846
FREIGHT ALFREDO IT DIFFERENTLY.

01:46:25.912 --> 01:46:29.216
IT'S INTERESTING TO ME. THAT THE

01:46:29.282 --> 01:46:30.217
HIGH THROUGHOUT THIRTY IS ASKING

01:46:30.283 --> 01:46:32.519
FOR MORE MONEY. BUT THEN WE

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:33.620
DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:35.322
DOING WITH THE MONEY SO WHY

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:37.090
WOULD WE GIVE. THEM MORE MONEY

01:46:37.157 --> 01:46:38.625
IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:40.894
BEEN HAPPENING. I WILL LASTLY

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:43.263
SAVED IN MY COMMENTS. THAT WHEN

01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:44.798
WE WENT HIGH SPEED RATHER ONE

01:46:44.865 --> 01:46:46.666
THE CONCEPT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:46:46.733 --> 01:46:47.601
OR THIS PROJECT WAS FIRST PUT ON

01:46:47.667 --> 01:46:49.569
THE BALLOT. THE ESTIMATE WAS

01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:51.972
THAT THIS ENTIRE PROJECT WOULD

01:46:52.038 --> 01:46:53.507
BE THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS

01:46:53.573 --> 01:46:55.242
. AND NOW WITH APPROACHING A

01:46:55.308 --> 01:46:57.677
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS- ON THE

01:46:57.744 --> 01:47:00.914
ON THE HIGHER RANGE. SO SO MY

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:03.650
QUESTION TO THE ELIO IS. HOW

01:47:03.717 --> 01:47:06.319
REALISTIC. IS THIS BUSINESS PLAN

01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:07.654
I MEAN IN IN YOUR IN IN YOUR

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:09.356
CANDID ANALYSIS I'LL THE

01:47:09.422 --> 01:47:10.257
SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY STATE

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:14.461
THAT. JUST FOUR- AN EXAMPLE. THE

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:15.328
HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY

01:47:15.395 --> 01:47:16.997
ASSUMES AN INFLATION RATE OF TWO

01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:19.432
POINT 25% FOR COST MATERIALS THE

01:47:19.499 --> 01:47:20.567
CURRENT RATE OF SEVEN POINT FIVE

01:47:20.634 --> 01:47:22.536
PERCENT. AND YOU INDICATED IN

01:47:22.602 --> 01:47:24.871
YOUR HAND OUT THAT THE INFLATION

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:27.641
FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. WAS

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:30.243
13% TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO TO THE

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:32.646
ELIO HOW REALISTIC IS THIS

01:47:32.712 --> 01:47:35.849
BUSINESS PLAN. I THINK THERE'S

01:47:35.916 --> 01:47:37.484
JUST A LOT OF RISK RIGHT THERE

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:39.319
AND WE TALK ABOUT THIS I THINK

01:47:39.386 --> 01:47:40.587
ABOUT THIS BUT IT IS-

01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:43.089
PRESENTATION A LITTLE BIT BY- I

01:47:43.156 --> 01:47:45.292
THINK THERE'S A RISK ON THE ON

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:46.626
THE CONSTRUCTION COST SIDE AS

01:47:46.693 --> 01:47:48.829
YOU AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED- ASSEMBLY

01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:50.564
MEMBER CERTAINLY COST COULD BE

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:51.832
HIGHER I MEAN THIS IS REALLY

01:47:51.898 --> 01:47:53.400
NOT. A TIME WHERE WE'VE SEEN A

01:47:53.466 --> 01:47:55.168
LOT OF AND INCREASES IN

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:57.003
CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND THERE'S

01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:58.605
JUST A LOT OF RISK- IF IT'S

01:47:58.672 --> 01:48:00.407
PROJECT THERE'S THE AGAIN FOR

01:48:00.473 --> 01:48:01.408
THAT INITIAL CONSTRUCTION

01:48:01.474 --> 01:48:02.809
SEGMENT THAT RESEARCH OR CENTRAL

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:03.844
VALLEY SEGMENT SOMETIMES

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:05.445
REFERRED TO THAT ONE HUNDRED

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:07.480
NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT- YEAH WE

01:48:07.547 --> 01:48:08.949
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE FINAL

01:48:09.015 --> 01:48:10.150
CONTRACTOR CLAIMS WILL BE

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:12.352
RESOLVED THAT AND THAT AMOUNT

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:14.120
COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WE

01:48:14.187 --> 01:48:15.622
JUST DON'T KNOW RIGHT WE DON'T

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:18.225
HAVE INFORMATION. AND AT YET-

01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:19.726
FROM THE AGORI WERE HOPING TO

01:48:19.793 --> 01:48:21.695
GET SOME- WE'RE WE'RE THANK YOU-

01:48:21.761 --> 01:48:23.697
WITH THEM AND- OUR OFFICE IS

01:48:23.763 --> 01:48:24.764
MAJOR QUESTION- BUT AT THIS

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:27.167
POINT WE DON'T HAVE HAVE- ANY

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:29.169
INFORMATION REALLY ON WHAT THE

01:48:29.236 --> 01:48:30.937
SCALE OF THOSE COSTS WILL BE

01:48:31.004 --> 01:48:32.906
THEN THE EXTENSION TO MERCED

01:48:32.973 --> 01:48:34.708
AND- BAKERSFIELD THOSE ARE

01:48:34.774 --> 01:48:36.309
REALLY STILL THE VERY EARLY

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:38.612
PLANNING STAGES. NO THERE'S JUST

01:48:38.678 --> 01:48:40.013
THERE'S RISK THERE TO YOU RIGHT

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.549
SO THERE'S GONNA COSTS AND THEN

01:48:42.616 --> 01:48:43.984
ADDS MR KELLY MENTIONED THERE

01:48:44.050 --> 01:48:45.118
CERTAINLY WAS GONNA ON THE

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:46.586
REVENUE SIDE TO YOU I MEAN

01:48:46.653 --> 01:48:48.922
CAPITAL RESTORED CLEAN HANDS I'M

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:50.390
HAS GONE UP AND DOWN OVER YOU

01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:51.191
KNOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS IT'S NOT

01:48:51.258 --> 01:48:52.926
SUPER CONSISTENT SO WE HAD A

01:48:52.993 --> 01:48:54.661
COUPLE REALLY ROBUST RAP-

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:57.530
AUCTIONS. BUT WHAT I CAN SEE THE

01:48:57.597 --> 01:48:58.431
TWENTY THIRTY THERE'S JUST A LOT

01:48:58.498 --> 01:49:00.634
OF UNCERTAINTIES SO I'M I WOULD

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.369
HAVE LIKE THAT I THINK IT'S JUST

01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:05.538
IT'S TOUGH TO SAY- NO PROBLEM

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:06.506
YEAH BUT WE NEED TO GET A LOT OF

01:49:06.573 --> 01:49:07.574
FEDERAL FUNDING MAYBE THAT WILL

01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:09.075
HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE I THINK

01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:10.610
HISTORICALLY THE FEDERAL

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:11.578
GOVERNMENT HAD IT FUNDED I.

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:13.013
WOULD SURMISE BY THE SAME THING

01:49:13.079 --> 01:49:14.981
TWICE SO- YOU FIGURE OUT WHICH

01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:16.516
PIECES WE CAN GET THEM TO FIND

01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:18.652
THEY'VE ALREADY FUNDED- YOU KNOW

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:21.087
THE ONE NINETEEN ON THE TRACK

01:49:21.154 --> 01:49:22.188
WELL WHAT THEY COULD TO GET THEM

01:49:22.255 --> 01:49:23.823
HELP WITH EXTENSIONS WOULD WE

01:49:23.890 --> 01:49:25.325
WOULD THAT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:27.027
IN GRANTS YOU KNOW. I'M GRATEFUL

01:49:27.093 --> 01:49:28.061
SITUATION THERE'S NO MONEY

01:49:28.128 --> 01:49:29.296
THAT'S DEDICATED FOR THIS

01:49:29.362 --> 01:49:30.630
PROJECT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:32.365
BELL- MORE FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:43.009
AND INFRASTRUCTURE. BILL SO IT'S

01:49:43.076 --> 01:49:43.810
COMPATIBLE SO IT'S JUST ME JUST

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:45.578
DON'T KNOW- AND- THERE'S A LOT

01:49:45.645 --> 01:49:46.579
OF UNCERTAINTY OUT THERE AD

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:48.014
WELL THAT'S BECAUSE- COSTS. YOU

01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:48.581
KNOW THAT THEIR- HIGH. OF

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:50.517
INFLATION INCREASE IN CONTINUE.

01:49:50.583 --> 01:49:51.751
IF IT DOES I THINK THAT THAT

01:49:51.818 --> 01:49:52.519
WOULD BE. CERTAINLY JOHN FOR THE

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:53.486
PRIDE BUT- BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST

01:49:53.553 --> 01:49:55.055
HARD HARD TO THAT CRISP BALL.

01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:57.324
WHAT I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT IF

01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:57.991
THEY'LL BE INCREASE ITS MUCH IS

01:49:58.058 --> 01:49:59.259
THE SO A WHAT IT MAKES. FOR THE

01:49:59.326 --> 01:50:05.031
L. A. ELEMENT. DIFFERENT

01:50:05.098 --> 01:50:07.667
CALCULATIONS BASED ON DIFFERENT

01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:09.636
RANGES ASSUMING. DIFFERENT

01:50:09.703 --> 01:50:12.072
INFLATION RATES- AND MAYBE THIS

01:50:12.138 --> 01:50:14.074
IS A QUESTION FOR- FOR THE

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:16.142
THOMPSON AS WELL. BUT IT SEEMS

01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:19.646
TO ME THAT. ALL THE BUSINESS

01:50:19.713 --> 01:50:21.948
PLAN IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE

01:50:22.015 --> 01:50:23.416
ASSUMPTIONS IN IT. ANY OF THE

01:50:23.483 --> 01:50:24.918
ASSUMPTIONS ARE WRONG THEN WE'RE

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:27.187
MAKING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF

01:50:27.253 --> 01:50:30.423
INVESTMENT- ON SOMETHING THAT IS

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:33.293
INCORRECT AND SO IF THERE'S A

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.762
TWO POINT 25% AND INFLATION RATE

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:37.797
ASSUME TO BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:38.431
AUTHORITY WOULD MAKE SENSE TO

01:50:38.498 --> 01:50:43.670
DO- DIFFERENT RANGES ASSUMING 5%

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:48.708
7% OR SOMETHING HIGHER. I'M SO-

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:50.110
I'LL DEFER TO LIVE IN JUST A

01:50:50.176 --> 01:50:51.478
MINUTE YEAH I MEAN I THINK I

01:50:51.544 --> 01:50:53.480
THINK THAT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:54.080
TO HAVE A RANGE RIGHT AND IT

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:55.515
ALREADY HAS INTRODUCED IN THE

01:50:55.582 --> 01:50:56.883
LAST FEW BUSINESS PLANS THEY'VE

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:58.151
INTRODUCED THEM YOU KNOW

01:50:58.218 --> 01:51:00.053
AFFECTIVE RANGES AND SO THERE IS

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:01.554
CURRENTLY A RANGE FOR EXAMPLE

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:02.956
FOR CENTIMETERS. BUT YOU'RE

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:03.990
RIGHT IT DOESN'T INCORPORATE

01:51:04.057 --> 01:51:06.026
THAT SORT OF MAYBE EXACTLY THE

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.727
RANGE OF CONSTRUCTION COST

01:51:07.794 --> 01:51:08.828
INFLATION SO I THINK THAT'S

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:09.963
CERTAINLY SOMETHING REASONABLE

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:11.998
TO THINK ABOUT- JUST RECOGNIZING

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:13.433
ESPECIALLY THAT THE I MEAN I

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.435
THINK FOR YEARS RIGHT WE WERE IN

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:16.569
THIS RELATIVELY LOW INFLATION

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:17.771
ENVIRONMENT AND MAYBE THIS WAS

01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:19.572
JUST LESS OF A CONCERN. AND

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:20.707
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL WE WERE

01:51:20.774 --> 01:51:22.609
SEEING YOU KNOW PRETTY MODEST-

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:25.145
INFLATION AND YOU KNOW OVER THE

01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:26.946
LAST YEAR THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:28.648
THAT DYNAMIC AND WE'VE SEEN MUCH

01:51:28.715 --> 01:51:30.083
MORE PRONOUNCED INFLATION YEAH

01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:31.851
MORE BROADLY AN ECONOMY AS WELL

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:32.786
AS- CERTAINLY THE CONSTRUCTION

01:51:32.852 --> 01:51:34.621
COSTS SO- I THINK IT IS WORTH IT

01:51:34.687 --> 01:51:35.855
SORT OF REVISITING THAT AND

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:36.856
THINKING ABOUT HOW THAT SHOULD

01:51:36.923 --> 01:51:38.625
BE. IT SHOULD BE WORKED AND

01:51:38.691 --> 01:51:39.225
HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:41.694
AUTHORITY ON THAT AND WILL- I

01:51:41.761 --> 01:51:46.266
DON'T KNOW IF YOU. HAVE ANY

01:51:46.332 --> 01:51:47.267
OTHER COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO ADD

01:51:47.333 --> 01:51:49.069
. I JUST WONDERED IF THE- THAT

01:51:49.135 --> 01:51:52.138
THE WORD I KEPT YOU. WAS AND-

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:53.907
THAT IS WE DON'T KNOW THERE IS A

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:55.775
WIDE RANGE OF. OUTCOMES FROM

01:51:55.842 --> 01:51:59.012
THE- COST ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:01.781
ARE M. S. I DON'T SEE THIS TO BE

01:52:01.848 --> 01:52:02.782
CRITICAL OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:04.484
AUTHORITY I SIMPLY SAY IT TO

01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:05.952
MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE

01:52:06.019 --> 01:52:08.755
LEGISLATURE. THAT WE DON'T KNOW

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:10.190
HOW THESE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO

01:52:10.256 --> 01:52:12.659
TURN OUT AND WE CAN'T HELP THESE

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:14.661
NUMBERS TURNED OUT PART OF THAT.

01:52:14.727 --> 01:52:16.763
IS THAT PAST EXPERIENCE DOESN'T

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:19.799
GIVE US RIGHT YET CONFIDENCE IN

01:52:19.866 --> 01:52:21.734
FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THAT WE

01:52:21.801 --> 01:52:23.536
WILL BE NICE IF IT DID BUT IT

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:25.538
DOESN'T. LESSONS HAVE BEEN

01:52:25.605 --> 01:52:27.006
LEARNED AT I THINK IMPROVEMENT

01:52:27.073 --> 01:52:28.575
IS THERE BUT THE LESSONS HAVE

01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:30.810
BEEN LEARNED HAVE BEEN EXPENSIVE

01:52:30.877 --> 01:52:33.780
AND THEY'VE BEEN LEARNED THE

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:36.749
HARD WAY. BUT ALSO. WE DO KNOW A

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:38.651
LEADERSHIP DON'T WHO PROJECT

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:41.788
BUDGET ARE NOT UP DATE HELLO AS

01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:43.256
WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T COURT. AS

01:52:43.323 --> 01:52:45.892
MUCH OF BIG. WE MY HAVE. WE

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:47.861
DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE WITH

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:49.629
STUFF THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE YET

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:51.197
LIKE ELECTRIFICATION OR

01:52:51.264 --> 01:52:53.666
TUNNELING OR OR SIGNALING A

01:52:53.733 --> 01:52:55.101
ROLLING STOCK IN THAT REPRESENTS

01:52:55.168 --> 01:52:58.338
MORE THAN HALF OF THE COST OF

01:52:58.404 --> 01:53:00.507
THE PROJECT. AND WE DON'T KNOW

01:53:00.573 --> 01:53:01.174
WHAT THE FULL IMPACT OF COVER IT

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:03.643
IS GOING TO BE IN TERMS OF

01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:04.144
INFLATION AND TERMS OF

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:07.280
PERFORMANCE. ALL IN I HAVE TO

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:08.982
TELL YOU THAT I WAS RUNNING THE

01:53:09.048 --> 01:53:10.416
NORTHEAST CORNER. DURING THE

01:53:10.483 --> 01:53:12.652
CARTER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:14.854
TRIED TO UPDATE. BUDGETS THE

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:16.656
WHAT INFLATION REALLY ONES WE

01:53:16.723 --> 01:53:18.124
WERE TOLD BY IT WOULDN'T BE THAT

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:19.192
THAT CONFLICTS WITH THE

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:21.661
ADMINISTRATION'S REVEAL TRUTHS

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:23.062
ABOUT WHAT INFLATION IS GOING TO

01:53:23.129 --> 01:53:26.533
BE. SO YOU CAN'T UPDATE. SO

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:28.268
BRIAN IS OPERATING WITHIN

01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:30.003
CONSTRAINTS THAT MAKE IT REALLY

01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:34.073
HARD FOR HIM TO GIVE YOU.

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.642
ACCURATE INFORMATION. NORMALLY

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:37.944
WHAT YOU WHEN THIS SEARCH. MAKE

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.846
A MAJOR EFFORT TO ATTRACT ALL OF

01:53:39.913 --> 01:53:42.916
THE AREA BOB. SOME YOU CAN'T

01:53:42.982 --> 01:53:44.083
ATTACK WE DON'T KNOW WHEN

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:45.518
INFLATION IS GOING TO BE NEXT

01:53:45.585 --> 01:53:48.154
YEAR HOW LONG THAT IS GOING TO.

01:53:48.221 --> 01:53:50.623
CONTINUE BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.058
ATTACK THE NEED FOR UP TO DATE

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:53.760
THE MOST RECENT UP TO DATE

01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:55.962
INFORMATION THE MOST RECENT.

01:53:56.029 --> 01:53:58.665
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAS

01:53:58.731 --> 01:54:01.067
HAPPENED TO DATE AND- THEN

01:54:01.134 --> 01:54:03.803
CERTAINLY PRESS OWN THINGS LIKE

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:05.605
ALL TRYING TO GET ESTIMATES THE

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:07.740
BEST AVAILABLE ESTIMATES OF

01:54:07.807 --> 01:54:10.944
STUFF THAT HASN'T DONE YET BASED

01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:12.011
ON FOREIGN EXPERIENCE SO.

01:54:12.078 --> 01:54:14.214
OVERALL I THINK THE ADVICE THE

01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:16.416
LEGISLATURE IS THAT TAKE THESE

01:54:16.482 --> 01:54:19.552
NUMBERS WERE CAUTIOUSLY. BECAUSE

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:21.721
THEY ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE RANGE

01:54:21.788 --> 01:54:24.557
OF OUTCOMES END OF THE TRIED TO

01:54:24.624 --> 01:54:27.293
DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO ACQUIRE

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.395
THE BEST POSSIBLE UNDERSTANDING

01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:32.665
OF WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN AND

01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:34.767
WHAT THE EXPERIENCES TOLD US. I

01:54:34.834 --> 01:54:35.868
THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON I THINK

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:37.770

RISK AND UNCERTAINTY HAVE BEEN

01:54:41.874 --> 01:54:44.110

I A BUNCH TRAILING LIMITING OR

01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:09.636
PREVENTING- HSR A FROM

FUNDING AS SPECIFIED IN STATUTE

01:55:20.413 --> 01:55:21.481
THIS COULD BE IMPORTANT GIVEN

01:55:21.547 --> 01:55:22.482
THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:55:22.548 --> 01:55:23.850
AUTHORITY HAS ENTERED INTO

01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:24.550
PASSED GRANT AGREEMENTS THAT

HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS

01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:36.296
CONSTRAINED OUR- OUR ABILITY TO

01:55:36.362 --> 01:55:38.431
MAKE DECISIONS. WELL I WOULD

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:40.233
ARGUE THAT THAT THAT SORT OF THE

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:42.235
ORIGINAL GRANT AGREEMENT THAT WE

01:55:44.871 --> 01:55:46.839
SET IN MOTION A LOT OF THIS

01:55:46.906 --> 01:55:48.408
PROJECT IN A LOT OF THE

01:55:48.474 --> 01:55:49.242
CHALLENGES THAT THE PROJECT IS

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:50.643
BASED- I THINK EVEN THE

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:52.211
AUTHORITY- HAS MENTIONED A

01:55:52.278 --> 01:55:54.647
NUMBER OF TIMES THAT. YOU KNOW

01:55:54.714 --> 01:55:55.982
WE RUSHED WE ENTERED INTO THIS

01:55:56.049 --> 01:55:57.016
AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDS WERE

01:55:57.083 --> 01:55:58.418
GONNA DO THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:55:58.484 --> 01:56:00.553
RIGHT WE HAD TO START RIGHT AWAY

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.688
YEAH THESE THESE THAT THESE VERY

01:56:01.754 --> 01:56:05.458
SHORT- DEADLINE. I TO SPEND ERA

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:07.694
FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE AND WE THAT

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.496
WE- ENTERED INTO THAT. TO

01:56:10.563 --> 01:56:12.632
CONTRACT BEFORE WE REALLY DONE

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:14.467
THE PRELIMINARY WORK BEFORE WE

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:16.369
DIVE RIGHT AWAY BEFORE WE DONE

01:56:16.436 --> 01:56:18.805
THE DESIGN- AND THE STATE ENDED

01:56:18.871 --> 01:56:21.607
UP- HAS HAS BEEN PAYING FOR IT-

01:56:21.674 --> 01:56:22.909
REALLY EVER SENSE AND THOSE ARE

01:56:22.975 --> 01:56:24.811
STILL THE ISSUES THAT. I THINK

01:56:24.877 --> 01:56:26.045
MISTER KELLY WAS REFERRING TO

01:56:26.112 --> 01:56:27.313
SOME OF WHICH ARE SO HE'S HE'S

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:29.615
STILL WITH SOLVING YOU KNOW

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:30.650
CLAIMS AND OTHER ISSUES THAT

01:56:30.717 --> 01:56:32.618
RELATE TO THAT RIGHT. SO YOU

01:56:32.685 --> 01:56:34.554
KNOW THAT'S PART OF IT'S GREAT

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:35.922
TO GET FEDERAL MONEY I THINK WE

01:56:35.988 --> 01:56:37.190
KNOW WHAT WE AT THE STATE ALWAYS

01:56:37.256 --> 01:56:39.892
LIKE TO GET- GET ADDITIONAL

01:56:39.959 --> 01:56:40.426
RESOURCES FROM THE FEDERAL

01:56:40.493 --> 01:56:41.828
GOVERNMENT THAT WE DO NEED TO BE

01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:43.930
REALLY CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS.

01:56:43.996 --> 01:56:46.532
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE-

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:47.767
DO THOSE AGREEMENTS WITH THE

01:56:47.834 --> 01:56:49.202
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHERE DO SO

01:56:49.268 --> 01:56:50.937
IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HAVE

01:56:51.003 --> 01:56:52.438
REQUIREMENTS THAT COSTING US

01:56:52.505 --> 01:56:54.640
MORE YOU KNOW. I'M AND CREATING

01:56:54.707 --> 01:56:56.042
MORE CHALLENGES FOR THE STATE SO

01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:57.176
I THINK THAT'S BEEN JUST REALLY

01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:59.545
HISTORY OF THE PROJECT FROM FROM

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:00.913
REALLY YOU KNOW IT'S BEGINNING

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.181
THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONSTRAINED BY

01:57:02.248 --> 01:57:04.484
OUR FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENTS-

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:06.853
AND THAT SORT OF- YOU KNOW. MADE

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:08.588
MADE MADE THE PROJECT MAKES THEM

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:10.957
STOP OPTIMAL CHOICES RUSHED

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:13.059
THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

01:57:13.126 --> 01:57:15.395
RUSHED PERHAPS- AND MADE IT MORE

01:57:15.461 --> 01:57:16.796
CHALLENGING AND THEN AND

01:57:16.863 --> 01:57:18.131
CERTAINLY THIS MOST RECENT-

01:57:18.197 --> 01:57:19.265
GRANT AGREEMENT THAT THAT

01:57:19.332 --> 01:57:21.134
REALLY- IDENTIFIES ALIVE. THE

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.201
ELECTRIFICATION REALLY

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:23.903
THROUGHOUT SO THAT'S IT THAT

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:26.139
THERE'S I THINK I THINK. AGREE

01:57:26.205 --> 01:57:27.907

01:57:44.891 --> 01:57:46.426
MAY ISSUES THAT ABOUT BEEN OUT

01:57:46.492 --> 01:57:47.894

IT IS ROLLING STOCK PURCHASES IN

02:02:16.195 --> 02:02:18.464
THE BUSINESS PLAN AND IF SO

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:20.966

THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LOVE TO

02:02:52.965 --> 02:02:54.934
SIT DOWN AND- TRY TO WORK OUT

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.971
THESE DETAILS. AT THAT WE HAVE

02:02:59.038 --> 02:03:00.406
MISTER SMITH NEXT OF ALL BY

02:03:00.473 --> 02:03:02.308

02:03:04.543 --> 02:03:06.278
MEETING HERE. BUT THE PROBLEM IS

02:03:06.345 --> 02:03:09.348
WE GOT ON A BUDGET PLAN. THAT WE

02:03:09.415 --> 02:03:10.983
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S IN THE

02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:13.018
BUDGET. BECAUSE WE HAVE A OF

02:03:13.085 --> 02:03:14.987
BUSINESS PLAN THAT WE'RE TRYING

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:17.923
TO. APPROVE FUNDING FOR. WE

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:19.391
WON'T HAVE THE BUDGET FOR

02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:22.428
ANOTHER YEAR. SO MY QUESTION IS

02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:25.731
IN REGARDS TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:27.600
PACKAGE SETS BEFORE US. WHAT IS

02:03:27.666 --> 02:03:28.534
GONNA HAPPEN TO THE REST OF THE

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:31.070
PROJECT IF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:03:31.137 --> 02:03:34.740
DOES NOT GET IT FUNDING. MAYBE

02:03:34.807 --> 02:03:37.243
THE L. A. O. OR WHO CAN ANSWER

02:03:37.309 --> 02:03:40.946
THAT QUESTION. AND THEN I WOULD

02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:43.849

BUDGET CHAIR KING AND VICE CHAIR

02:03:49.989 --> 02:03:52.725
FONG IF WE CAN TOTALLY SEPARATE

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:55.294
THIS OUT IN THE BUDGET STRICTLY

02:03:55.361 --> 02:03:58.564
FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL WE ALL HAVE

02:03:58.631 --> 02:04:00.065
MAJOR CONCERNS WITH IT. I DON'T

02:04:00.132 --> 02:04:01.734
THINK IT SHOULD BE A PACKAGE

02:04:01.801 --> 02:04:03.235
WITH OTHER ITEMS THAT WE HAVE

02:04:03.302 --> 02:04:04.637
MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE

02:04:04.703 --> 02:04:06.872
NEED TO DO IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:04:06.939 --> 02:04:10.643
HAVE A STAND. BUDGET ITEM. AND

02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:12.945
WE WILL KNOW FOR THE VOTE OF THE

02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:15.447
LEGISLATORS FOR THE- PEOPLE IN

02:04:15.514 --> 02:04:18.584
THEIR DISTRICTS KNOW EXACTLY HOW

02:04:18.651 --> 02:04:20.820
THEY STAND WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:04:20.886 --> 02:04:22.521
. AND NOT KEEPING THE BALL DOWN

02:04:22.588 --> 02:04:25.024
THE ROAD. FOR THIS PROJECT

02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:27.126
BECAUSE IT STARTED OUT WITH THE

02:04:27.193 --> 02:04:29.461
VOTERS APPROVED IT IN TWO

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:30.062
THOUSAND EIGHT IT'S GOING TO

02:04:30.129 --> 02:04:32.064
COST THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:33.332
AND I WAS GOING TO GET ON IN LOS

02:04:33.399 --> 02:04:36.068
ANGELES AND BE IN FRISCO. IN AN

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:39.338
HOUR TO. THERE WERE NO WHERE

02:04:39.405 --> 02:04:43.776
NEAR THAT. OVER A 130% OVER

02:04:43.843 --> 02:04:45.945
BUDGET ALREADY THERE WERE NO

02:04:46.011 --> 02:04:47.046
WHERE NEAR WHERE IT'S GOING TO

02:04:47.112 --> 02:04:48.848
BE. WE HAVE A PROJECT IN THE

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:51.984
CENTRAL VALLEY. IT MIGHT BE A

02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:53.786
BICYCLE PATH TO WE STARTED WITH

02:04:53.853 --> 02:04:55.821
TWO TRACKS NOW WE'RE DOWN TO ONE

02:04:55.888 --> 02:04:58.157
TRACK WE HAVE NO TRACK AND NO

02:04:58.224 --> 02:05:00.559
TRAINS. WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK

02:05:00.626 --> 02:05:01.827
AT THIS PROJECT AND I THINK IT

02:05:01.894 --> 02:05:03.729
NEEDS TO BE A STANDALONE BUDGET

02:05:03.796 --> 02:05:06.932
ITEM. SO THE EIGHTY MEMBERS OF

02:05:06.999 --> 02:05:09.201
THE ASSEMBLY. CAN VOICE OUR

02:05:09.268 --> 02:05:11.370
CONCERN FOR CONSTITUENTS THEY

02:05:11.437 --> 02:05:12.371
REPRESENT IN THE STATE OF

02:05:12.438 --> 02:05:14.273
CALIFORNIA AND FINALLY SAVE

02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:24.383
THING- CHAIR TANGO IS NOT HERE.

02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:26.986
TO HEAR YOU REFER TO IS CITY BY

02:05:27.052 --> 02:05:31.624
SHORTHAND THAT'S NOT PREFERRED.

02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:33.592
MISTER SMITH BENNETT. THANK YOU

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:34.793
VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO JUST TRY

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:37.696
TO POINT OUT SOME RISK THAT I

02:05:37.763 --> 02:05:38.797
THINK HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED

02:05:38.864 --> 02:05:41.734
OR APPROPRIATELY- CLARIFIED

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.469
WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN

02:05:43.535 --> 02:05:45.070
STATED THAT THE GREATEST RISK IS

02:05:45.137 --> 02:05:47.740
THE LACK OF- CONSISTENT FUNDING

02:05:47.806 --> 02:05:48.841
FOR THE PROJECT BUT I WOULD

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:51.243
OFFER TO YOU EQUALLY AS GREAT IS

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:53.612
A COMPLETE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT.

02:05:53.679 --> 02:05:54.847
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH COST

02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:56.882
AND THEY THEY ARE TWO SIDES OF

02:05:56.949 --> 02:05:59.018
THE SAME COIN BUT WE DON'T KNOW

02:05:59.084 --> 02:06:01.954
WHAT THE FUNDING SOURCES ARE WE

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:03.422
ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST

02:06:03.489 --> 02:06:05.291
ARE NOW IF YOU IF YOU JUST WENT

02:06:05.357 --> 02:06:06.926
TO THE PUBLIC AND SAID. YOU KNOW

02:06:06.992 --> 02:06:08.427
WE'RE GOOD RARE TACKLE THE

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:09.962
BIGGEST PROJECT WE'VE EVER DONE

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:10.529
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:06:10.596 --> 02:06:11.897
FUNDING IS GOING TO BE AND WE

02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:13.098
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST ARE I

02:06:13.165 --> 02:06:14.166
THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY

02:06:14.233 --> 02:06:16.068
THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD PLANNING IN

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:17.569
TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD. BUT

02:06:17.636 --> 02:06:19.838
THIS PROJECT WAS INITIATED BY

02:06:19.905 --> 02:06:21.974
INITIATIVE FRIED BITE BITE BITE

02:06:22.041 --> 02:06:23.542
OF OVER THE PUBLIC SO DIDN'T GO

02:06:23.609 --> 02:06:24.109
THROUGH THE NORMAL PLANNING

02:06:24.176 --> 02:06:25.644
PROCESS BUT I WOULD OFFER A

02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:28.247
THIRD RISK THAT I THINK IS GOING

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:30.182
TO CONTINUE TO COME UP BECAUSE

02:06:30.249 --> 02:06:31.784
WE'RE SO DESPERATE FOR FUNDING.

02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:34.820
AND THAT IS THAT A DESPERATE

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:37.356
SEARCH FOR SHORT TERM FUNDING IS

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:39.058
CAUSING US TO MAKE DECISIONS

02:06:39.124 --> 02:06:41.093
STEP PUT THE WHOLE PROJECT AT

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:43.829
RISK. AND YOU JUST HEARD STAFF

02:06:43.896 --> 02:06:46.098
SAY WE ONE OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY

02:06:46.165 --> 02:06:47.700
WE HAD TO GET CONTRACTS SIGNED

02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:48.934
RIGHT AWAY SO WE SIGNED

02:06:49.001 --> 02:06:50.669
CONTRACTS BEFORE WE EVEN HAD

02:06:50.736 --> 02:06:54.039
DESIGNS. AND NOW WE'VE GONE BACK

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:56.942
AND WE FIND OUT AND WE'RE WE'RE

02:06:57.009 --> 02:06:59.445
WE'RE MOVING TO THE POINT WHERE

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:01.647
WE'RE GOING TO THE PUBLIC AND

02:07:01.714 --> 02:07:02.848
THE POLITICAL SUPPORT NEEDED FOR

02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:04.683
THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO JUST

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:06.185
TAILSPIN DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:07.920
SAYING THAT THEY CAN'T GET THEIR

02:07:07.987 --> 02:07:09.989
HANDS ON THIS SO I WOULD OFFER A

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:14.994
THIRD RISK. IS THAT WE CAN. A

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:17.663
THE TO. OF GRAB. SHORT FUNDS.

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:19.865
THAT REQUIRE US TO DO THINGS

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:21.166
THAT IN THE LONG RUN ARE NOT

02:07:21.233 --> 02:07:23.902
GOOD FOR THE PROJECT RIGHT- AND

02:07:23.969 --> 02:07:26.839
SO. THAT INITIATIVE IS THE

02:07:26.905 --> 02:07:29.441
EXACT. OPPOSITE WAY OF HOW YOU

02:07:29.508 --> 02:07:31.043
WOULD LAUNCH THE BIGGEST PROJECT

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:32.945
AT AND IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT WE'RE

02:07:33.012 --> 02:07:35.781
NOW STUCK WITH WHERE WE ARE. SO

02:07:35.848 --> 02:07:44.723

REASSESS ALL OF THOSE RISK AND

02:07:53.899 --> 02:07:55.901
TRY TO ELIMINATE AS MANY OF US

02:07:55.968 --> 02:07:57.736
POSSIBLE GIVEN WHERE WE ARE WITH

02:29:13.210 --> 02:29:14.845
VISIONARY APPROACH TOWARDS A

02:29:14.912 --> 02:29:16.881
TRANSIT AND INVESTMENT IN ACTIVE

02:29:16.947 --> 02:29:19.150
TRANSPORTATION I WE HAVEN'T SEEN

02:29:19.216 --> 02:29:21.652
THAT KIND OF VISION BEFORE OF I

02:29:21.719 --> 02:29:23.220
THINK FROM THE GOVERNOR AND IT'S

02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:24.588
REALLY GREAT TO SEE AN CERTAINLY

02:29:24.655 --> 02:29:26.324
COMPLIMENTARY OF ALL OF OUR

02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:28.159
GOALS WITH CLIMATE AND EQUITY

02:29:28.225 --> 02:29:29.126

WE'RE TRYING TO DO I WILL

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:32.296
CONTINUE TO PLUG FOR EVEN MORE

02:29:32.363 --> 02:29:34.632
MONEY TO GO INTO TRANSIT- YOUR

02:29:34.699 --> 02:29:36.100
PARTICULARLY IN OUR POPULATION

02:29:36.167 --> 02:29:37.068
CENTERS THERE'S A GREAT HUNGER

02:29:37.134 --> 02:29:38.903
OUT THERE TO IMPROVE EXISTING

02:29:38.969 --> 02:29:41.038
TRANSIT AND TO EXPAND ON IT. AND

02:29:41.105 --> 02:29:43.341
GIVEN THE FEDERAL APPETITE FOR

02:29:43.407 --> 02:29:44.342
THOSE INVESTMENTS I THINK THAT'S

02:29:44.408 --> 02:29:45.776
ALSO A GREAT PLACE FOR

02:29:45.843 --> 02:29:46.844
CALIFORNIA TO PARTNER WITH THE

02:29:46.911 --> 02:29:48.079
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THOSE

02:29:48.145 --> 02:29:49.847
GOALS AND IT CLICKED CHECKS

02:29:49.914 --> 02:29:52.216
EVERY BUTTON THE JOB BUTTON THE

02:29:52.283 --> 02:29:55.186
EMPLOYMENT BUTTONED- AND IS A TO

02:29:55.252 --> 02:29:56.754
BE CHECK BOX THE CLIMATE

02:29:56.821 --> 02:29:58.289
MOBILITY EQUITY IT'S ALL OF

02:29:58.356 --> 02:29:59.623
THOSE THINGS WRAPPED UP INTO ONE

02:29:59.690 --> 02:30:00.658
BUT I ACTUALLY MY QUESTIONS ARE

02:30:00.725 --> 02:30:01.892
ACTUALLY ABOUT THE ACTIVE

02:30:01.959 --> 02:30:03.260
TRANSPORTATION PART OF THIS

02:30:03.327 --> 02:30:04.161
WHICH IS ALSO EXTREMELY

02:30:04.228 --> 02:30:07.331
EXCITING- WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD

02:30:07.398 --> 02:30:09.533
THIS REALLY UNFORTUNATE UBTECH

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:11.602
IN FATALITIES. FOR PEDESTRIANS

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:12.803
AND CYCLISTS LAST COUPLE

02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:14.138
OF YEARS AND IT JUST CONTINUES

02:30:14.205 --> 02:30:15.539
TO TRACK ABOARD IT'S SOMETHING

02:30:15.606 --> 02:30:17.942
THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN I TO ME

02:30:18.008 --> 02:30:19.076
TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WE SEE IT

02:30:19.143 --> 02:30:20.177
BEING TALKED ABOUT FINALLY

02:30:20.244 --> 02:30:21.979
NATIONALLY THIS IS ACROSS THE

02:30:22.046 --> 02:30:23.180
COUNTRY IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO

02:30:23.247 --> 02:30:25.249
CALIFORNIA. AND ALONG WITH THAT

02:30:25.316 --> 02:30:26.183
INVESTMENT IN ACTIVE

02:30:26.250 --> 02:30:29.720
TRANSPORTATION WE ALSO- CLEARLY

02:30:29.787 --> 02:30:30.554
DID NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

02:30:30.621 --> 02:30:32.390
INVESTMENTS ALSO INCREASED

02:30:32.456 --> 02:30:34.058
SAFETY FOR THOSE USERS FOR

02:30:34.125 --> 02:30:35.292
PEOPLE THAT ARE WALKING AND

02:30:35.359 --> 02:30:37.128
PEOPLE THAT ARE CYCLING AND I

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:39.163
ALSO AND I'M CONCERNED THAT SOME

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:43.734
OF OUR INVESTMENTS DON'T. REALLY

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:44.735
DO THAT THAT ADDING- ADDING THE

02:30:44.802 --> 02:30:46.103
- WITHOUT PRIOR. THIS FOR THOSE

02:30:46.170 --> 02:30:47.805
USER- LEADS TO A DANGEROUS

02:30:47.872 --> 02:30:49.874
SITUATION AND DISCOURAGES PEOPLE

02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:51.509
FROM FULLY UTILIZING THOSE

02:30:51.575 --> 02:30:52.610
SYSTEMS AND I HEAR THAT A LOT

02:30:52.676 --> 02:30:56.480
FROM. PEOPLE LIKE ME A MIDDLE.

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:58.482
THIS ALMOST MIDDLE AGED WOMEN

02:30:58.549 --> 02:31:00.684
WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO- TO BIKE

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:02.219
AROUND BUT OUR MAYBE NERVOUS TO

02:31:02.286 --> 02:31:03.954
DO SO BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FULLY

02:31:04.021 --> 02:31:05.222
PROTECTED BIKE LANE THEY WANT TO

02:31:05.289 --> 02:31:06.390
KNOW THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND I. I

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:07.358
THINK THAT CONNECTING THE

02:31:07.425 --> 02:31:08.893
SAFETY- WITH ACTIVE

02:31:08.959 --> 02:31:10.161
TRANSPORTATION IS EXTREMELY

02:31:10.227 --> 02:31:11.595
IMPORTANT AYE I GUESS MY

02:31:11.662 --> 02:31:13.998
QUESTION IS HOW. IN FOR HOW

02:31:14.064 --> 02:31:15.733
INFORMATION ABOUT THE BIKE

02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:17.134
SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS THAT

02:31:17.201 --> 02:31:18.502

AND HOW. THEY ARE FUNDED. AND I

02:31:26.544 --> 02:31:27.578
WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF

MAKE TO OUR FINDINGS- PROGRAMS

02:31:32.850 --> 02:31:34.785
AND WHAT WE CAN DO IN THIS

02:31:34.852 --> 02:31:35.753
PACKAGE TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY

02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:37.388
ARE WE INVESTING IN. AFTER

02:31:37.455 --> 02:31:38.489
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE

02:31:38.556 --> 02:31:41.025

MILES TRAVELED THAT THE

02:31:57.441 --> 02:31:58.876
RECREATIONAL CYCLING IS

02:31:58.943 --> 02:32:00.144
IMPORTANT BUT IF WE REALLY WANT

02:32:00.211 --> 02:32:01.545
TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS

02:32:01.612 --> 02:32:02.446
WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS

02:32:02.513 --> 02:32:04.515

ELECTRIFICATION OF THE STATE I

02:35:07.564 --> 02:35:08.832
THINK WE NEED TO USE OTHER
