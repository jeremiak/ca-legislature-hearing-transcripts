00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:45.990
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANTLY

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:47.959
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:50.061
THAT MUST BE HANDLED BY MANUAL

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:51.863
PROCESSING. IT IS ALSO SLOWING

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.398
THE GROWTH OF THE BACKLOG BY

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:55.266
ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR MANUAL

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:57.435
VERIFICATION OF MANY CLAIMS.

00:28:57.502 --> 00:28:58.903
THERE ARE INDICATIONS THE TOOL

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.505
IS WORKING TO BLOCK BLOCK

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.407
INVALID CAIMS AT THE DOOR. BUT

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:03.942
MORE DATA IS NEEDED IN THE

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:06.244
UPCOMING WEEKS TO MAKE A CLEAR

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:07.812
DETERMINATION ABOUT WHY CLAIMS

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:09.781
ARE AND AREN'T MAKING IT

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:11.883
THROUGH IT. AFTER A THOROUGH

EXTRACT DATA FROM PD SYSTEMS TO

00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:41.479
INFORM OPERATIONS. THIS IS A

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:43.314
CRITICAL CHIFFRE ET DE KNOWING

00:29:43.381 --> 00:29:44.949
WHERE IN THEIR SYSTEM CLAIMS

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.317

00:31:11.469 --> 00:31:12.837
STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDED THAT

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:15.406
EDIE USE DATA DRIVEN EFFORTS TO

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:17.308
PREVENT FRAUD AND ABANDON OLDER

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.444
PROCESSES THAT ARE NOT BASED ON

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.012
THE MODERN ATTEMPTS TO DEFRAUD

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:23.881
EDIE'S PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY

00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:25.083

THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:43.868
INNOVATION SHOULD BEGIN

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:46.804
IMMEDIATELY ONCE THE BACKLOG

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.206
HAS BEEN RESOLVED. WE ALL KNOW

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:49.474
THAT THE CODE NINETEEN EPIDEMIC

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.808
TRIGGERED AN UNPRECEDENTED

00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:51.943
VOLUME OF CLAIMS THAT HAS

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.378
OVERWHELMED THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:55.380
SYSTEMS AT ITS CORE. THE

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:56.781
DEPARTMENT HAS GROWN OVERLY

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:58.383
RELIANT ON A SINGLE GROUP OF

00:31:58.449 --> 00:31:59.784
PEOPLE WHO MUST PERFORM HIGHLY

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:01.719
SPECIALIZED TASKS TO PROCESS

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:04.255
CLAIMS. IN THE LONG RUN THE

00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:05.556
DEPARTMENT MUST TAKE STEPS TO

00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:06.791
SIMPLIFY THAT WORK BY

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.626
MODERNIZING THE PROGRAM

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:09.093
TOGETHER WITH THE NEW

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.130
TECHNOLOGY. FOR THIS REASON WE

00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:13.564
HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT EDT

00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:16.301

00:32:27.245 --> 00:32:28.746
FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:31.582
EXPERIENCE OF THOSE FILING FOR

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:32.283
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THIS

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.319
PROJECT WILL ALSO RESULT IN

00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:35.720
LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.388
TAXPAYERS IN THE DELIVERY OF

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:40.224
THESE BENEFITS. GOING FORWARD

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:41.759
THE STATE WILL NEED HYBRID ECH

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:44.062
POLICY TEAMS TO SUPPORT THE

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:45.396
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO

GUIDE- SOME OF THEIR

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:30.927
TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS- BUT

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:32.395
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT DABABNEH

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:35.231
AGENCY ITSELF IS NO LONGER

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:36.533
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE

TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS. AND GIVEN

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:44.040
OUR ASSESSMENT THAT MANY OF

00:55:44.107 --> 00:55:47.110
THE- MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:48.078
CAUSES OF THE BACKLOG AND DELAY

00:55:48.144 --> 00:55:49.612
WERE OPERATIONAL IN NATURE

00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:51.381
RATHER THAN TECHNOLOGICAL WE

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:52.148
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:54.484
LEGISLATURE ON REQUEST THAT GOV

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:56.853
OFFICE REMAIN CLOSELY INVOLVED

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.887
WITH THE PROJECT AND PROVIDE

00:55:57.954 --> 00:55:59.989
OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE AT LEAST

00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:02.058
UNTIL EDT HAS ELIMINATED THE

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:04.327
BACKLOG. THANK YOU ARE HAPPY TO

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:05.895
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. YOUR

00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:07.063
CONVENIENCE SURE THANK YOU

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.164
MISTER ALMOST TALK ABOUT

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:10.166
OPERATIONAL SHORTCOMINGS THAT'S

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:11.501
NOTHING NEW TO EASY TO USE IF

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:13.536
THE CAR FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:15.772
TWO DIFFERENT CHANGES OF

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:19.275
LEADERSHIP IS THAT CORRECT. I

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:20.176
THINK I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT

00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:22.812
AS AS SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL

00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:25.582
SHORTCOMINGS THAT. IMMEDIATE

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:27.350
DEFENSE DON'T NECESSARILY

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:28.251
APPEAR ASSHORTCOMINGS WHEN

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:29.853
WORKLOAD IS LOW BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:32.088
MANAGEABLE. BUT I DO BELIEVE

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:33.523
THAT SOME OF THESE SAME ISSUES

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.325
AROSE DURING THE GREAT

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:36.493
RECESSION MORE THAN TEN YEARS

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.862
AGO- THAT WE'RE SEEING NOW

00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:40.497
DURING DURING THE PANDEMIC SO

00:56:40.563 --> 00:56:42.332
YES SIR. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:44.734
THE FOCUS ON FRAUD- ISN'TIT IS

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:45.902
IT TRUE THAT A LOT OF THAT

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:48.371
FOCUS IS MANDATED BY THE

00:56:48.438 --> 00:56:49.906
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOT SO MUCH

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:53.777
CALIFORNIA POLICIES. THAT'S

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:56.446
TRUE SIR- THAT DO YOU I PROGRAM

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:58.348
IS A STATE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP

00:56:58.414 --> 00:56:59.582
THE STATE RECEIVES FEDERAL

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:00.950
FUNDING AND WITH THAT FEDERAL

00:57:01.017 --> 00:57:02.252
FUNDING THAT THE FEDERAL

00:57:02.318 --> 00:57:03.686
GOVERNMENT SETS PERFORMANCE

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:05.054
STANDARDS NOW THEY SET

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:07.557
STANDARDS ON UP OVERPAYMENTS

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:08.625
WHICH IS THAT THE FRAUD

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:09.793
STANDARD WE'RE TALKING HERE BUT

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:11.127
THEY ALSO SET STANDARDS ON

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:13.997
BENEFIT TIMELINESS- IN THE

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:15.165
OPINION OF THE STRIKE TEAM

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:17.000
REPORT IN SOME OF THEIR

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.535
FINDINGS THEY POINT OUT THAT

00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:20.603
THE STATE HAD. TENDED TO

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:23.106
EMPHASIZE THE FEDERAL

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:24.974
REQUIREMENTS ABOUT FRAUD. MORE

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.109
SO THAN THEY'VE EMPHASIZED THE

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:27.076
FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ABOUT

00:57:27.143 --> 00:57:30.113
BENEFIT PAYMENT TIMELINESS AND-

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.147
WITH THE POINT WE WOULD RAISE

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:33.116
IS. AT THIS POINT DURING A

00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:34.717
PANDEMIC GIVEN THE ECONOMIC

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:38.521
CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT BALANCE-

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:42.225
MAY HAVE BEEN. I CHALLENGE FOR

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:44.994
EDT N. AND ADDRESSING ITS

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:48.631
BACKLOG- GIVEN ITS HISTORICAL-

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:50.066
FOCUS ON THAT FRAUD PREVENTION

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:52.335
MEASURE BUT REGARDLESS THESE

00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:52.869
ARE BOTH FEDERAL MANDATES

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:55.605
CORRECT. THEY ARE YES OKAY SO

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:56.739
ITEMS SUCH AS WILL MAKE IT

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:57.473
CLEAR THAT IS NOT SOMETHING

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.442
THAT CALIFORNIA. IS DOING OF

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:01.578
ITS OWN VOLITION IS MANDATED BY

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:05.181
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I THINK

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:06.516
THAT'S A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:09.018
SIR- THE MANDATES THEMSELVES

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:11.020
ARE PERFORMANCE TARGETS SO THE

00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:12.188
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDE SOME

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:13.690
GUIDANCE ON HOW WE SHOULD GO

00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:14.958
ABOUT MEETING THOSE TARGETS.

00:58:15.024 --> 00:58:15.892
BUT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:17.927
PRESCRIBE EXACTLY HOW WE WOULD

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:20.930
DO SO- ONE INSTANCES THAT IT

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:22.165
MAY WELL BE THE CASE THAT THE

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:24.934
STATE COULD HAVE REACHED ITS-

00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:27.070
OVERPAYMENT FEDERAL TARGET. BY

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:29.405
USING A DIFFERENT STRATEGY FOR

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:32.342
VERIFYING CLAIMS- THE ID NEED

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:33.943
TOOL IS CERTAINLY ONE EXAMPLE

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.711
THAT THE STATE COULD HAVE

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:37.280
INSTITUTED. SEVERAL YEARS AGO-

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:38.715

WENT DOWN FROM ONE POINT SIX

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:53.963
MILLION TO ONE POINT THREE

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.899

LONG BECAUSE THAT'S THE THAT

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:16.452
THE WORK IS VERY COMPLEX AND

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:18.588
COMPLICATED. AND WE HAVE X.

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:20.590
NUMBER OF A PROFESSIONAL STAFF

THAT ARE SKILLED IN AND

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:24.494
TRAINED. IN THOSE AREAS EVEN

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.963

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:38.174
MOST COMPLEX. TASS AND RT SIX

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:40.643
VARIANTS PEOPLE ARE NOT USED-

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.645
COMPLEX TASK UNTIL SUCH TIME WE

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.013
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.615
THEM. SO WE'RE UTILIZING ALL

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:47.383
AVAILABLE RESOURCES IN A VERY

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.919
SYSTEMATIC WAY TO ENSURE THAT

FOR YOU KNOW IN THE NOVEMBER

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:25.488
DECEMBER. WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:26.089
THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME ON THESE

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:29.826
CASES. YEAH IT JUST DEPENDS ON

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:32.028
WHAT THE SITUATION AND WHERE

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:34.097
THEIR- I GUESS STUCK IN THIS IN

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:35.965
THE PROCESS BUT WE DO HAVE

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:39.002

OLDER ONES. SO YOU'RE TALKING

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:46.976
JUNE JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER

OCTOBER IN THOSE PLANS ARE

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:49.679
STILL PENDING OUT THERE AND

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:50.980
THAT'S THAT'S FIVE MONTHS FIVE

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.915
OR SIX MONTHS ALREADY. YES

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.751
THAT'S VERY LENGTHY- RICK

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.419
REGARDING YOUR THE YOUR

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.820
INVESTIGATIONS WITH CC ARE

01:00:57.887 --> 01:00:58.588
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GETTING THE

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:00.523
INMATES LIST THERE'S NOT ONE

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.724
BUT WE SEE A LOT OF FOLKS IN

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.493
COUNTY JAIL INMATES HERE

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.128
SEVERAL COUNTY THAT HAVE.

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:06.963
RACKED UP TEN OR TWELVE

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.564
THOUSAND DOLLARS USING THE

01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:10.233
STATE ISSUED OR COUNTY ISSUED

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:13.569
IPADS TO DO THESE CLAIMS. HOW

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:16.005
MANY INVESTIGATORS HAVE AN

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:18.941
EIGHTY D. WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:24.313
INVESTIGATORS. FROM AN EIGHTY

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.481
TWO FOR THESE PRODUCT THESE

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:27.316
CRIMINAL FRAUD ACTIVITIES- THE

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:30.119
CDC ARE IS IT IS VERY- MORE

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.454
AFTER THE FACT BECAUSE

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.622
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:34.390
LIST THAT WE CAN CROSS MATCH IT

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:37.193
IN AT THE VERY GET GO. BUT WE

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.628
ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO DO

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:41.097
WHAT WE CAN TO IDENTIFY ANY

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.232
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT'S GOING

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:44.367
ON UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:47.103
PANDEMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:48.905
THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY. IT HAS

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:51.307
IT'S LENIENT RULES THAT- IF

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.709
PEOPLE HAVE THE UTILIZED THEIR

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:54.577
OWN NAME AND SOCIAL SECURITY

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.913
NUMBER AND- YOU KNOW PRIVATELY

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.548
IT STATE OR NOT AND YOU KNOW

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:00.349
NOT A CURSE RATED. IT'S VERY

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:02.251
HARD TO DETECT LET'S WE KNOW

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.286
THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.455
INCARCERATED SOMETIME WE ONLY

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:09.392
KNOW THAT IS IF CDCR IS ABLE TO

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:09.959
GIVE US THE INFORMATION WE

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:11.327
NEED. SO THERE'S NO WAY YOU

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.395
WOULD KNOW IF SOMEONE'S DOING

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:14.964
IN THE COUNTY JAIL BECAUSE MOST

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:15.498
FOLKS ARE GOING BACK STATE

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.833
PRISON THESE DAYS. I THINK IT'S

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:17.800
INTERESTING BECAUSE THE COUNTY

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.502
HERE SEVERAL COUNTY WHEN FOLKS

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.304
WENT INTO CUSTODY A LOT OF A

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.438
RECEIVING GENERAL ASSISTANCE

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.207
THEY HAD THEY'RE ABLE TO TALK

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.042
WITH. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:27.743
THAT ONCE THOSE FILES FROM THE

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.912
CUSTODY THERE STOPPED THEY STOP

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:31.214
GETTING GENERAL ASSISTANCE. AND

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.149
THAT WAS DEEMED TO BE VERY

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:38.020
EFFECTIVE WITH THAT- ARE. YOU

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:38.621

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:40.790
POINT BEEN WORKING WITH

MORE ON THAT LEVEL- WORKS IN

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.731
FOCUSING ON THAT. BUT CERTAINLY

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.199
OUR HOPE IS TO WORK WITH THE

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:52.335
COUNTY. SURE SO SINCE YOU HAVE

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:53.336
TWENTY SEVEN INVESTIGATORS AT

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:57.240
MILLION PEOPLE. I NOW OKAY MOST

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:59.108

SPRING IN THE SUMMER. OF WAS

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:57.706
REALLY BASED ON- WORKLOAD OF

HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO US

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:19.762
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.930
PROBABLY SITUATIONS WHERE THEY

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:23.465

MY THIS THE COMING MONTH

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:10.913
BECAUSE TO BE HONEST IT'S VERY

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:11.814
HARD FOR US TO TELL OUR

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.949
CONSTITUENTS. THAT WE HAVE A

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:15.551
100% CERTAINTY THAT THIS WILL

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:16.318

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:18.120
MONTHS GIVEN. THE TRACK RECORD

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:20.889
NAPS- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:21.824
THAT THAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.326
SOME. SOME PRIDE IN IN THE

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.562
IMPLEMENTATION OF IT MAY. I DO

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:27.930
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS JUST ON THE

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.097
PRESS RELEASE THAT WE WERE

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:30.232
PROVIDED IN THE LAST TWELVE

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.100
HOURS. YOU SAID MORE THAN STE

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:34.203
ABOUT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. OF

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:35.871
INDIVIDUALS WERE ABLE TO VERIFY

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.439
THEIR ID ONLINE TO READY MADE.

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:39.708
PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION YOU

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:41.777
TOLD THE PUBLIC THAT ABOUT 60%

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.111
OF APPLICANTS WERE ABLE TO

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:44.613
AUTOMATICALLY VERIFY OR PUT

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.349
ANOTHER WAY. 40% WERE FLAGGED

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:48.851
FOR MANUAL REVIEW AND THAT'S

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:51.520
WHAT TOOK SO MUCH TIME. SO FROM

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.155
WHAT WE CAN TELL LOOKS LIKE

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.023
WE'VE GONE FROM 60% AUTOMATIC

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:58.093
VERIFICATION. 66% AUTOMATIC

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.962
VERIFICATION WHEN YOU TOLD US

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:01.630
WEEKS AGO THAT ID ME WOULD

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:03.665
AUTOMATICALLY VERIFIED OVER

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.267
NINETY ONE. PERCENT OF

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.669
ADVOCATES. SO HAS THIS TO MEET

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:08.270
YOUR EXPECTATIONS IT DOESN'T

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:11.340
SEEM LIKE THAT FROM THE VERY

01:15:11.406 --> 01:15:12.841
NUMBER PROVIDED US. YEAH

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:14.543
ABSOLUTELY IS PERFORMING AS

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.612
EXPECTED AS FAR AS THE UP THE

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:19.314
COMPLETE 9091% THAT WE'RE GOING

01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:20.749
FOR IS STILL TOO EARLY TO TAKE

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:23.318
A LOOK AT. THOSE NUMBERS- WE

01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:24.453
JUST HAVE SARTED GETTING

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:26.221
CLAIMS IN AND THEY HAVEN'T RUN

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:27.789
THROUGH ALL OF OUR AUTOMATED

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:30.826
PROCESSES EVEN OUTSIDE OF. IT

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:34.162
ME SO THE WE DON'T WE DON'T

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:35.497
REALLY HAVE ANY GOOD METRICS

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:38.200
YET AS FAR AS AS WHAT'S BEING

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:39.735
DONE THROUGH AUTOMATICALLY. WE

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.236
DO HAVE METRICS AS FAR AS HOW

01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:43.272
MANY PEOPLE ARE. GETTING

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:46.208
THROUGH IT ME AND- WERE THERE

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:46.775
BEING VALIDATED AND THEY'RE

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:48.277
BEING CLEARED. IF I COULD JUST

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:49.778
SAY YOU KNOW WE WERE EXPECTING

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:51.947
AN AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION OF

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.315
91% AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.751
IS AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION OF

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:57.052
SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. THAT'S A

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.254
REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE I'M JUST

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:01.056
GONNA LEAVE THAT AS A COMMENT-

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:02.991
AGAIN I'M NOT JUST WHICH- IS

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:03.792
ACTUALLY MOVING THINGS FASTER

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.727
BUT I HOPE TO BE. UP ENOUGH

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:06.261
HOPE THAT WE'LL GET MORE

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:07.963
INFORMATION. MORE TALK FOR A

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:09.498
MOMENT ABOUT THE DASHBOARD AND

01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:11.400
JUST MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT IT.

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.936
THIS LEGISLATURE LED BY OUR

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:15.904
COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY.

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:16.939

OUR CHAIRMAN. AB ONE OH SEVEN

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:22.511
SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A SENSE

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.746

YOU YOU YOU PROVIDE A

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.757
DASHBOARD. THAT'S VERY

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:36.925
DIFFICULT FOR THE PUBLIC TO

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:38.527
FIND. IT SHOULD BE EASILY

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:40.095
ACCESSIBLE ON YOUR WEBSITE BUT

INSTEAD IT'S LINKED IN A PRESS

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:44.066
RELEASE. IT'S IN A PDF FORM. SO

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.701

TRANSPARENT IT'S NOT

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:57.245
ACCOUNTABLE. THIS IS NOT THE

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.113
SPIRIT OF WHAT WE ASK YOU TO

L. WE REFER TO. AND THAT'S

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:13.862
EXACTLY WHAT WE DID- I

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:15.364
CERTAINLY WILL GO BACK AGAIN

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.798

ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO MAKE IT

01:17:20.535 --> 01:17:22.270
MORE USER FRIENDLY BUT WE WERE

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:23.872
RESPONDING TO EXACTLY WHAT THE

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.640

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.392
ABOUT IT BUT I DON'T THINK THIS

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.993
THE DASHBOARD YOU PROVIDED

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.328
MEETS WITH THE SPIRIT OF WHAT

CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT EVERY

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:43.512
DAY. IT'S JUST NOT A QUICK FIX

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:45.046
IT JUST IT TAKES TIME AND

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:47.115
RESOURCES. BUT I TELL I TOTALLY

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:48.416

ENGLISCHER OR NON ENGLISH

01:19:55.023 --> 01:19:56.925

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:02.497
SHEER MASSES IN THIS YEAR

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:05.600
VOLUMES. SO YEAH THAT'S NOT A

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:07.169
GOOD SITUATION I TOTALLY AGREE.

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.870
SO IF I COULD JUST RESPOND TO

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:10.238
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN THAT SAME

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.806

THIS AREA- AND I'M AT A POINT

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.055
WHERE WHEN A CIVIL RIGHTS

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:27.956
ORGANIZATION BRINGS THIS TO MY

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:30.659

BACKLOG IT'S CLEAR- THERE ARE

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:06.187
SEVERAL ITEMS WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:07.022
FOCUSING ON ONE IS TO WORKING

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:08.023
WITH THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:10.325
INNOVATION- WORKING WITH FROM

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:12.127
MY PROCESS RE ENGINEERING

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:14.362
ASPECT. LOOKING AT THE CURRENT

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:16.965
OPERATION IN POLICY AND

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:20.035
PROCEDURE ASPECTS OF THE EIGHTY

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.803
TO TAKE A LOOK WHAT IMPROVEMENT

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:23.371
THAT CAN BE MADE. SO IT'S NOT

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:25.407
NECESSARILY APPLYING TECHNOLOGY

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.075
TO THE EXISTING PROCESS BUT

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:29.344
USING TECHNOLOGY AS A WAY AND

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:31.646
AS ENABLE OUR TO STREAMLINE THE

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:33.548
PROCESS. AND I BELIEVE- L. A.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.916
O. WAS ALSO REFERENCING THIS

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:36.685
THAT IT'S REALLY BAD POLICY

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:39.354
TECH OF COMBINATION. IS WHAT WE

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:41.056
NEED TO LOOK AT MODERNIZATION.

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:44.292
SECOND TO THAT THERE ARE THREE-

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.795
MODULES IF YOU WOULD OUR FOCUS

01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:49.230
FOR THE BSN. THAT IS-

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.299
DISABILITY INSURANCE AS WELL AS

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:53.001
PAID FAMILY LEAVE THAT'S ON TOP

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:57.706
OF- UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. AND

01:22:57.772 --> 01:23:00.475
WHEN THE RE ASSESSMENT BEGINS

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:01.276
NEEDS TO LOOK AT HOW ARE THE

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:04.045
PRIORITIZES JOKES WITH APPLY.

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:05.914
AND THEN SPECIFICALLY APPLY TO

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.215
THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS ON WHAT YOU

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:09.384
DID THE SAME PROVIDE. AND THIRD

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:11.219
ITEM MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:14.656
FROM A USER- INPUT ASPECT. NOW

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:16.191

TREMENDOUS OF- EXPERIENCE THAT.

01:23:20.795 --> 01:23:22.797
THIS WOULD GAIN Y EDT IN TERM

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:25.300
OF WHAT THE BEST WAY TO SERVE-

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:27.569
THOSE- CLAIMANTS OR INDIVIDUALS

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:29.671
NEED SERVICE FROM EDT. TAKING

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:32.240
DOES IMPORT ESTHER DRIVING THE

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:34.743
FOCUS AND THE PRIORITY AND HOW

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.745
TO BE. A STREAMLINED TECHNOLOGY

01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:38.012
SYSTEMS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:40.315
THOSE IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:42.350
IMPORTANT. AND WITH ALL OF

WELL AS INNOVATIVE IDEAS FROM

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:56.464
MANY OF THE FIRMS IN VARIOUS IN

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:57.966
SIZE AND THAT SHOULD BE BY

01:23:58.032 --> 01:24:00.802
DESIGN SO WE CAN HEAR- MANY

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:02.570
DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:04.539
RESOLVING THIS PROBLEM. THANK

01:24:05.473 --> 01:24:06.708
ONGOING CONVERSATION INTO THE

COMING YEARS- I KNOW I'M GONNA

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:10.545

SAID THE QUESTIONS AND THAT IS

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.088
ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN

THIS REPORT SO THE STRIKE TEAMS

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:23.725
FINISH ITS WORK AND I THINK THE

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:25.393
TOP CONCERN MANY OF US HAVE IS

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.161
THESE ARE GREAT

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.362
RECOMMENDATIONS. HOW DO WE

ENSURE THEY'RE ALL GONNA GET

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.832
DONE WE LEARNED TODAY THAT

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:31.866
FIFTY THREE OF THE HUNDRED

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:33.001
ELEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS AREN'T

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:35.336
EVEN IN PROGRESS. AND WE

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:37.472
HAVEN'T RECEIVED AN ACCOUNTING

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:40.008
OF WHAT THE SIX SIX AND SO. MY

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:42.811
QUESTION TO THE DIRECTOR IS I'M

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:44.345
ASSUMING YOU SUPPORT THE

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:45.914
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE ELIO

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.549
ABOUT A PROGRESS TRACKER SO

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:49.684
THAT WE CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.419
ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE-

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:52.720
LIKE TO ALSO ASK THE STREET

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:53.888
TEAM WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:57.091
INVOLVEMENT FOR ENSURING THESE

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:57.759
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DONE LET ME

01:24:57.826 --> 01:25:00.094
JUST. NOTE FROM DISTRICT TEAM

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:02.464
REPORT. THAT THERE WERE MANY

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:03.798
INSTANCES IT WAS IT WAS

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:05.200
FASCINATING READING BECAUSE WE

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:09.070
LEARN FOR EXAMPLE. THAT EVEN

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:09.537
THOUGH THE STRIKE TEAM

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:11.039
RECOMMENDED. THAT EDT TURN OFF

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:12.140
CERTAIN THINGS THAT WERE

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:13.641
FLOODING PLANES FOR MANUAL

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:16.678
PROCESSING. EDT RESISTED THAT

01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:18.246
AND DISTRICT TEAM CONCLUDED

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.347
THAT EDT COULD'VE AVOIDED

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:20.448
SENDING HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.217
OF CLAIMS TO MANUAL PROCESSING

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:26.154
IF IT. AND LISTEN TO THIS TRACK

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:27.388
TEAM REPORT. DISTRICT ALSO.

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:28.423
WROTE THAT A NUMBER OF THESE

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:30.124
ISSUES WERE SO SIMPLE TO FIX

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:31.326
THAT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR WHY

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:32.627
THEY WEREN'T DRESSED PRIOR TO

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:34.095
THE RELEASE OF THIS REPORT. SO

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:36.064
MANY OF US READ THIS. ARE

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:37.999
CONCERNED BECAUSE WE PROVIDED

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.300
MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:40.969
THIS REPORT TO EDT FOR MONTHS

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:42.837
AND WE WERE NOT. WE WERE NOT

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:45.039
LISTEN TO. SO THE CONCERN IS

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:46.608
NOT THAT THE STRIKE TEAM IS DON

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:48.309
WHO'S ACTUALLY GOT A WHOLE EDT

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:49.777
ACCOUNTABLE. FOR GETTING THIS

01:25:49.844 --> 01:25:52.080
DONE SO. SO TO DIRECTOR

01:25:52.146 --> 01:25:54.148

THE L. A. RECOMMENDATIONS

01:25:56.851 --> 01:25:58.653
AROUND PROGRESS TRACKING AND TO

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.855
THE STRIKE TEAM ONE UNDERSTAND

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.624
YOUR ROLE MOVING FORWARD YES

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:30.464
OR MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY GO TO

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:33.167
YOU I ONLINE AT EIGHTY TO APPLY

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:36.503
FOR A CLING. SO THAT PERCENTAGE

01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:38.939
AS OF- SHARON HAS MISSION. WE

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:40.507
ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH EDT

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:42.676
AND EDP IS MONITORING THAT ON A

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:44.445
DAILY BASIS TO SEE HOW THAT

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:46.547
PERCENTAGE IS BEING ACHIEVED.

01:39:46.613 --> 01:39:48.415
BUT THE NINETY ONE NINETY FOUR

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:50.184
PERCENTAGE IT'S ABOUT THE U. I.

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:53.187
ONLINE NOT THE SAME AS THE ID

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:54.722
NEED VERIFICATION PERCENTAGE

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:57.558
WHICH CURRENTLY IS SIXTY FOUR

01:39:57.624 --> 01:39:59.293
TO SEVENTY PERCENT. AND AS IN

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.160
JUST FOR THE MOTHER POINT OF

01:40:00.227 --> 01:40:03.564
REFERENCE- ID ME IMPLEMENTATION

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:06.300
IT'S AT A NATIONAL LEVEL- AT

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:07.935
THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE FEDERAL

01:40:08.001 --> 01:40:09.903
VETERANS AFFAIR. AS WELL AS

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:11.305
SOCIAL SECURITY MINISTRATION

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:13.006
JUST TO NAME A FEWHAVE

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:14.108
IMPLEMENTED IT AND SEVERAL

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:15.609
OTHER STATES. SO ON THIS

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:18.846
NATIONAL AVERAGE THE PASSING

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:21.348
RATE OR SO SAYS IS HOVERING AT

01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:23.684
ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT. AND FOR

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:26.253
THE STATE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.555
HIGHER PERCENTAGE OR COMPLEXITY

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.724
POTENTIALLY DUE TO FRAUD. THE

01:40:30.791 --> 01:40:32.426
AVERAGE THAT WE HAVE SEEN IS

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:35.028
HIRING BETWEEN SEVENTY TO

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:35.662
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. SO WITH

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:38.065
THAT. FROM THE EARLY INDICATION

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:39.266
THAT WE HAVE SEEN WE ARE

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:41.869
ACTUALLY QUITE HAPPY WITH THE-

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:47.141
PASSING RATE OF. 70% ACHIEVED

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:48.242
BUT AT ANY. OKAY ALL RIGHT

01:40:48.308 --> 01:40:48.809
ANDERSON THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:51.879
THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M AND

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:53.380
FIVE DIRECTOR HILLIARD COUPLE

01:40:53.447 --> 01:40:56.750
OF QUESTIONS FOR YEAR- SO. I'M

01:40:56.817 --> 01:40:58.719
NOT TOO TO BE LOOKING BACKWARDS

01:40:58.786 --> 01:40:59.820
BUT I THINK I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:02.423
WRAP MY HEAD AROUND. AT THE

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:04.691
ASSESSMENTS IN THE STRIKE TEAM

01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:06.994
REPORT AND REALLY WHERE WE GO

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.530
FROM HERE SO WHEN WE HAVE HAD

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:11.198
WE'VE HAD TWO PREVIOUS HEARINGS

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:14.935
AND- YOU BLAMES THE DEPARTMENT

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:16.637
BACKLOG AND THAT THE FIVE

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:17.638
ISSUES IN THE NIGHTMARE THAT

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:19.473
WAS UNFOLDING AT U. D. D. ON

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.774
TWO THINGS YOU BLAME IT ON THE

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:22.976
LEGACY SYSTEMS. ISSUES AND THEN

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:24.678
YOU BLAMED IT ON A LACK OF

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:27.581
STAFFING AND WERE FIVE MOVING

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:28.482
TO HIGHER AND I THINK ACTUALLY

01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:29.817
DID HIRE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE

01:41:29.883 --> 01:41:31.185
THOUSAND PEOPLE AS I READ THE

01:41:31.251 --> 01:41:32.686
STRIKE TEAM REPORT IT'S

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:34.354
ACTUALLY REALLY A FUNDAMENTAL

01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:36.190
REBUKE. OF BOTH OF THOSE

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:37.825
STRATEGIES ARE BOTH OF THOSE

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:41.562
ASSESSMENTS SO. AND IT NUMBER

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:43.130
ONE IS THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:44.698
POINTS OUT THAT THIS BACKLOG IS

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:46.500
DO YOU. NOT TO OUTDATED

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:48.168
TECHNOLOGY BUT TO OPERATIONAL

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:52.139
SHORTCOMINGS SO DO YOU AGREE

01:41:52.206 --> 01:41:54.575
WITH THAT ASSESSMENT WELL FIRST

01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:58.212
OF ALL IT AT. IT'S MORE OF THE

01:41:58.278 --> 01:41:59.246
CHECK I SEE IT MORE OR THE

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:01.215
TECHNOLOGY WHERE THE ID ME WAS

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:03.083
SO INSTRUMENTAL BECAUSE ONCE

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:05.452
THE WAY PROGRAM CAME INTO PLAY

01:42:05.519 --> 01:42:06.487
I'M FROM AN OPERATIONAL

01:42:06.553 --> 01:42:08.422
STANDPOINT IT WAS A VERY SLOW

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:09.723
PROCESS SAYING THAT WE DIDN'T

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:11.658
HAVE THE CORRECT TOOLS TO HELP

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:13.660
WITH OPERATIONS. AND THEN ONCE

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:17.164
WE DID WE IMPLEMENTED RECENTLY-

01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:19.666
THAT'S JUST PUTTING US IN A

01:42:19.733 --> 01:42:24.137
MUCH BETTER POSITION. OKAY AND

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:29.343
I IN TERMS AS THE HIRING OF HE

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:30.711
HAS THOUSANDS OF NEW STAFF

01:42:30.777 --> 01:42:33.113
MEMBERS THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.648
POINTS OUT THAT THAT WAS NOT

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:37.518
ONLY JUST A TOTAL WASTE OF

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:39.186
TAXPAYER DOLLARS BUT THAT IS

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:42.489
ACTUALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND

01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:44.892
FIVE. ULTIMATELY MADE THINGS

01:42:44.958 --> 01:42:47.761
EVEN WORSE SO AND THEY ADVISE

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:50.063
YOU TO STOP HIRING THOSE PEOPLE

01:42:50.130 --> 01:42:51.732
I GUESS TWO QUESTIONS. DO YOU

01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:53.834
AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT AND

01:42:53.901 --> 01:42:56.904
NUMBER TWO WHAT IS THE PLAN NOW

01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:59.907
WITH THOSE FIVE FIVE THOUSAND

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:02.476
NEW PDT STAFF MEMBERS. SO IT

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:03.710
WASN'T A MATTER THAT WE DIDN'T

01:43:03.777 --> 01:43:05.312
NEED EVERYBODY IT WAS A MATTER

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:07.748
OF HOW WE WERE- ALLOCATING OUR

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:11.385
STAFF- AND WHILE WE'RE TRYING

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:14.087
TO TACKLE THE BACKLOG. SO WE DO

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:16.690
NEED ALL THESE PEOPLE AND- OUT

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:18.292
WE JUST MOVE THEM TO DIFFERENT%

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:20.460
AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY UNTIL

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:22.329
SUCH TIME TO GET TO THE BACKLOG

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:23.096
AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO THE

01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:26.166
TRAIN THEM. NOW WE HAVE ABOUT

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:27.067
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE STILL

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:29.303
WITH US FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:30.504
AND OTHER BRANCHES WITHIN OUR

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:31.772
DEPARTMENT THAT WILL BE

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:33.774
RETURNING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.676
MONTHS SO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

01:43:35.742 --> 01:43:38.045
WE HAVE HIRED THAT- ARE ALREADY

01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:39.746
HELPING TO MITIGATE AND BRING

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:42.482
DOWN THE BACKLOG. THAT'S NOT

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:44.051
SOME OF THE LESS COMPLEX STUFF

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.819
BUT NO THERE NEVER THE LESS

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:47.454
IT'S ALL GOES TO THE BACKLOG I

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:48.722
WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:50.023
PICK UP THEIR TRAINING AGAIN

01:43:50.090 --> 01:43:51.792
FOLLOWING THE BACKLOG BEING

01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:55.629
BURNED DOWN. SO AGAIN THAT. IT

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:57.197
IS EVERY SINGLE PERSON IS

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:59.633
NEEDED- IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:03.370
HOW WE WERE UTILIZING- AND

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:04.071
ALLOCATING OUT THE WORK. I

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:05.472
THINK I AM I WOULD I WOULD SAY

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:07.341
AND WE CAN UNFORTUNATELY IT

01:44:07.407 --> 01:44:08.075
SOUNDS IT LOOKS LIKE SECRETARY

01:44:08.141 --> 01:44:09.576
RICHARDSON'S NOT HERE SO

01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:10.811
PERHAPS WE CAN GET ONE OF THAT

01:44:10.877 --> 01:44:12.179
DISTRICT TEAM FOLKS TO CLARFY

01:44:12.245 --> 01:44:13.947
THE ASSESSMENT BECAUSE- THE WAY

01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:15.115
THAT I READ THE ASSESSMENT. IS

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:17.084
THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF A

01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:19.186
RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:20.621
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:23.523
TECHNOLOGY FIX FOR IDENTITY

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:24.758
VERIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE.

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:26.693
IT YOU HAVE KEPT 40% OF CLAIMS

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.995
FROM GOING TO MANUAL PROCESSING

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:30.397
WOULD HAVE OBVIATED THE NEED.

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:32.299
TO HIRE. THOUSANDS OF

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:33.367
ADDITIONAL STAFF MEMBERS THAT

01:44:33.433 --> 01:44:34.935
THAT WAS HOW I READ DISTRICT

01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:36.903
TEAM ASSESSMENT WHICH SOMETHING

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:40.440
WAS DIFFERENT THAN. YOURSELF AB.

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:42.476
AND SO I GUESS JUST MIGHT MY

01:44:42.542 --> 01:44:44.778
FINAL QUESTION IS THAT THE

01:44:44.845 --> 01:44:47.781
STRIKE TEAM AB REPORT NEEDS THE

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.316
TAG IN ADDITION TO SOME OF

01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:52.085
THESE TACTICAL ISSUES. IN ORDER

01:44:52.152 --> 01:44:53.987
TO MOVE EDT FORWARD THERE NEEDS

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:56.356

ALONE WE'VE RECEIVED. NEARLY

01:59:36.035 --> 01:59:38.538
SIX HUNDRED FIFTY ENVELOPES

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:39.605
THAT WE SUSPECTED FRAUDULENT

01:59:39.672 --> 01:59:41.307
BECAUSE THE NAMES OF THESE

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:43.442
ENVELOPES THAT ARE ON THESE

01:59:43.509 --> 01:59:45.545
ENVELOPES NEVER LIVED AT THE

RESIDENCES NOT MULTI UNIT

01:59:51.217 --> 01:59:52.818
COMPLEXES SO THERE'S NO REASON

01:59:52.885 --> 01:59:55.488
FOR CONFUSION. MANY OF THE

01:59:55.555 --> 01:59:58.090
ENVELOPES HAVE AS WE'VE BEEN

01:59:58.157 --> 01:59:59.859

02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:31.190
OFFICER- JUST PREVIOUSLY. IN

02:00:31.257 --> 02:00:33.960
BEVERLY HILLS I IT I SUBMIT TO

02:00:34.026 --> 02:00:35.795
YOU THAT STATEWIDE THIS IS A

02:00:35.861 --> 02:00:38.698
GARGANTUAN PROBLEM. I WOULD I

02:00:38.764 --> 02:00:41.267
WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST. THAT THE

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:43.803
GOVERNOR RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:44.870
FOR WHAT IT IS BECAUSE THESE

02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:46.973
ARE STATE RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:00:47.039 --> 02:00:47.607
GOING TO BE BADLY BADLY NEEDED

02:00:47.673 --> 02:00:49.675
AS WE'RE- GONNA BE FACING

02:00:49.742 --> 02:00:51.243
DEFICITS IN OUR BUDGET HERE IN

02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:55.448
THE NEAR FUTURE. WE NEED TO.

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:57.083
INVESTIGATE AND HAVE THEM

02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:58.784
MITIGATION PROCESSES IN PLACE

02:00:58.851 --> 02:01:01.053
RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.822
IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW

02:01:02.888 --> 02:01:04.290
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD

02:01:04.357 --> 02:01:06.659
SET UP WITH A TASK FORCE THAT

02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:08.861
COULD HELP UNITE LOCAL

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:11.464
RESOURCES AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF

02:01:11.530 --> 02:01:13.699
STATE RESOURCES ARE WOEFULLY.

02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:15.401
UNABLE TO HANDLE THIS- PROBLEM

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:17.103
AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE

02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:18.537
WOULD GIVE IT THE ATTENTION IT

02:01:18.604 --> 02:01:20.539
DESERVES BECAUSE THESE.

02:01:20.606 --> 02:01:23.509
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. GOING

02:01:23.576 --> 02:01:25.277
WITHOUT ANY KIND OF

02:01:25.344 --> 02:01:27.346
INVESTIGATION IN MOST CASES. WE

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:28.981
NEED TO DO BETTER THAN THIS OUR

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:31.017
RESOURCES ARE. NEED TO BE

02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:32.852

02:01:40.926 --> 02:01:42.461
FOR THE CHIEF AND MAYBE THE

02:01:42.528 --> 02:01:44.330
MAYOR BUT WHEN YOU INVESTIGATED

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:45.531
THESE CASES IN YOUR OWN

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:47.566
JURISDICTION. OBVIOUSLY YOU

02:01:47.633 --> 02:01:49.802

HOW DID YOU. FIND THESE CASES

02:01:56.375 --> 02:01:58.144
WERE ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE I

02:01:58.210 --> 02:01:59.045
WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE

02:01:59.111 --> 02:02:02.682
DONE AND FIGURE OUT WHY ET DE

02:02:02.748 --> 02:02:07.353
HASN'T DONE THE SAME THING.

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:10.389
YEAH SO WE- IT WAS REALLY A

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:13.392
CASE BY CASE BASIS WE- THE

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:16.696
SHORT ANSWER IS WHEN WE MADE.

02:02:16.762 --> 02:02:18.531
THE WHATEVER INVESTIGATIVE STOP

02:02:18.597 --> 02:02:21.200
WE DID. WE NOTICED THAT THE

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:24.203
CARD HOLDER I DID NOT MATCH THE

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:26.072
PERSON THAT WAS DETAINED. AND

02:02:26.138 --> 02:02:27.506
THEN WHAT WE DID IS WE ALSO

02:02:27.573 --> 02:02:30.643
TOOK THE RECEIPTS FROM WHATEVER

02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:34.547
RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT- THAT.

02:02:34.613 --> 02:02:35.681
THAT THE MERCHANDISE WAS

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:37.983
PURCHASED FROM AND WE'RE ABLE

02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:40.986
TO MATCH THE FRAUDULENT DEBIT

02:02:41.053 --> 02:02:43.823
CARD TO THE REALLY THE STOLEN

THAT WAS PURCHASED WITH THE

02:02:46.459 --> 02:02:48.761
FRAUD SO DOES THE SHORT ANSWER

02:02:48.828 --> 02:02:51.230
IS WE WERE ABLE TO- IDENTIFY

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:53.299
THE PERSON WHO WE HAD DETAINED.

02:02:53.365 --> 02:02:56.035
AND WE SAW THAT THAT WAS NOT-

02:02:56.102 --> 02:02:58.637
THE PERSON ON THE CARD AND THEN

02:02:58.704 --> 02:03:00.973
YOU REALLY- ASKED A QUESTION

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:04.276
THAT SEGWAYS INTO THE FOLLOW UP

02:03:04.343 --> 02:03:06.312
BESIDES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:03:06.378 --> 02:03:08.247
WHO THE CARD IS REALLY- IN THE

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:11.050
NAME OF. IS VERY CHALLENGING

02:03:11.117 --> 02:03:13.018
AND VERY LABOR INTENSIVE. GOT

02:03:13.085 --> 02:03:15.087
IT. SO WHEN YOU FIRST IDENTIFY

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:16.622
THE INDIVIDUAL HOW DID THAT

02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:18.491
HAPPEN WAS THAT BECAUSE OF

02:03:18.557 --> 02:03:19.959
SOMETHING IDENTIFIED FOR ME

02:03:20.025 --> 02:03:22.728

INDIVIDUAL AND WHICH LED TO

OBVIOUSLY THE BIGGER

02:03:29.301 --> 02:03:35.107
DISCOVERIES. A LOT OF TIMES IT

02:03:35.174 --> 02:03:36.609
CAME FROM A CALL FOR SERVICE

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:11.957
RIGHT WHAT'S RIGHT OKAY SO I'M

02:12:12.024 --> 02:12:13.258
ASKING THAT BECAUSE I'M JUST

02:12:13.325 --> 02:12:14.826
TRYING TO GET A SENSE IF ONCE

02:12:14.893 --> 02:12:17.062
WE GET TO NINE THOUSAND AND

02:12:17.129 --> 02:12:18.964
THEN WE CUT BACK BY ANOTHER

02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:22.401
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WE'RE WE'RE

02:12:22.467 --> 02:12:25.270
ROUGHLY AROUND SIXTY FIVE

02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:27.606
HUNDRED. SO ON AN ONGOING BASIS

02:12:27.673 --> 02:12:28.173
WE'RE GONNA HAVE SIXTY FIVE

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:31.043
HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. WHICH WE

02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:33.412
TREAT THE WHICH MEANS THAT

02:12:33.478 --> 02:12:35.614
THAT'S THREE TIMES THE NUMBER

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:37.282
OF EMPLOYEES WE HAD AT THE

02:12:37.349 --> 02:12:40.919
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. SO AT

02:12:40.986 --> 02:12:42.421
AND EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS ARE

02:12:42.487 --> 02:12:45.223
DWARFING THE NUMBER OF

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:47.993
EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS. HOW IS

02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:51.563
THAT BEING MANAGED. WELL I- FOR

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:53.131
ONE THING THAT NEW HIRES ARE

02:12:53.198 --> 02:12:55.534
LIMITED TERM BECAUSE WHEN THE

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.436
PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT AND

02:12:57.502 --> 02:12:59.171
PROGRAM STARTED THE CURES ACT

02:12:59.237 --> 02:13:02.641
IT WAS TEMPORARY IN NATURE- SO

02:13:02.708 --> 02:13:06.144
AT SOME POINT THEY WILL OF. NOT

02:13:06.211 --> 02:13:08.046
BE WORKING FOR EDT ASSUMING

02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:10.148
THAT CONGRESS DOESN'T PASS

02:13:10.215 --> 02:13:11.350
SOMETHING IN THE END OF

02:13:11.416 --> 02:13:13.518
DECEMBER AND WE HAVE SOMETHING

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:15.554
ELSE TO TAKE ITS PLACE OR TO

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:21.793
CONTINUE IT. SO OKAY AND WHEN

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:24.730
DO YOU SEE THAT TAPERING OFF.

02:13:24.796 --> 02:13:28.800
ALL THIS WHEN. WHAT WOULD YOU

02:13:28.867 --> 02:13:31.570
SAY SIX MONTHS. A GOOD SIX

02:13:31.636 --> 02:13:32.938
MONTHS- ASSUMING IT'S NOT

02:13:33.004 --> 02:13:36.308
EXTENDED. SO WHAT AND WHAT

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:38.543
WOULD THE NUMBER COME BACK DOWN

02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:39.778
TO WOULD IT GO BACK TO AGAIN

02:13:39.845 --> 02:13:42.814
TWO THOUSAND OR- IT COULD BUT

02:13:42.881 --> 02:13:44.883
WITH THE NEW TOOL THAT THE-

02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:47.652
STRIKE TEAM PROVIDED US. IT'S A

02:13:47.719 --> 02:13:49.654
BURN DOWN CHART I AS I REFER TO

02:13:49.721 --> 02:13:51.456
IT IS A PREDICTIVE MODEL WHERE

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:53.191
WE CAN PUT IN INVENTORIES

02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:55.260
WORKLOADS AND STAFFING AND

02:13:55.327 --> 02:13:56.795
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED

02:13:56.862 --> 02:13:58.263
AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN BETWEEN

02:13:58.330 --> 02:13:59.798
THE WORKLOADS. SO THAT'S WHAT

02:13:59.865 --> 02:14:01.233
WE'LL BE USING MOVING FORWARD

02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:03.068
TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

02:14:03.135 --> 02:14:05.270
RIGHT NUMBER OF STAFF- AT THE

02:14:05.337 --> 02:14:07.506
RIGHT LEVELS UP TO MEET ALL OF

02:14:07.572 --> 02:14:10.108
OUR WORKLOADS. RIGHT NOW IT

02:14:10.175 --> 02:14:13.478
SAYS WE NEED ALL OF THEM. K.

02:14:13.545 --> 02:14:17.749
BUT SAID. LET'S LOOK AT THINGS

02:14:17.816 --> 02:14:19.284
ON A ON A THIRTY THOUSAND FEET

02:14:19.351 --> 02:14:22.854
VIEW- THE STRIKE TEAM HAD MADE

02:14:22.921 --> 02:14:24.723
SOME EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF-

02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:27.926
DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU

02:14:27.993 --> 02:14:29.995
WHAT DOES EDT OR DO YOU AND

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:32.497
YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM AGREE WITH

02:14:32.564 --> 02:14:34.099
ALL OF THEM. YES WE DID AGREE

02:14:34.166 --> 02:14:36.601
WITH ALL OF THEM. JIM WHO'S

02:14:36.668 --> 02:14:38.236
GOING TO BE IN CHARGE WITH

02:14:38.303 --> 02:14:38.670
IMPLEMENTING ALL THE

02:14:38.737 --> 02:14:40.572
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WHAT

02:14:40.639 --> 02:14:44.176
TIMELINE. SO WE WILL HAVE A

02:14:44.242 --> 02:14:45.210
TIME LINE COMPLETED BY THE END

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:47.179
OF THE MONTH- AND WE'LL BE GLAD

02:14:47.245 --> 02:14:51.583
TO PROVIDE YOU ARE MATRIX- THAT

02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:52.984
THAT SHOWS ALL THE

02:14:53.051 --> 02:14:55.454
RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL AS THE

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:56.354
WHEN WE EXPECT TO IMPLEMENT

02:14:56.421 --> 02:14:59.458
THEM- MOST OF THEM AND I THINK

02:14:59.524 --> 02:15:01.393
NINETY ONE OF THE HUNDRED AND-

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:04.429
ELEVEN R. I. T. US SOLUTIONS.

02:15:04.496 --> 02:15:07.699
OF SO R. I. T. BRANCH WILL BE-

02:15:07.766 --> 02:15:09.100
IMPLEMENTING THOSE IN

02:15:09.167 --> 02:15:09.901
PARTNERSHIP WITH ARE YOU AYE

02:15:09.968 --> 02:15:12.170
BRANCH- AND OUR NEW CHIEF

02:15:12.237 --> 02:15:14.239
DEPUTY DIRECTOR CAROL WILLIAMS-

02:15:14.306 --> 02:15:15.841
HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE

02:15:15.907 --> 02:15:18.877
IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THOSE ON

02:15:18.944 --> 02:15:19.778
STRIKE TEAMS RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:15:19.845 --> 02:15:24.483
OKAY SO THEN THE NON NINETY

02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:25.951
PLUS SAFETY OF STRIKE TEAM

02:15:26.017 --> 02:15:27.319
TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE CULTURE

02:15:27.385 --> 02:15:29.020
OF DVD AND THE CHANGES THAT

02:15:29.087 --> 02:15:33.124
NEEDED TO BE MADE. EDT AGREE

02:15:33.191 --> 02:15:36.995
WITH THE ASSESSMENT. I THINK

02:15:37.062 --> 02:15:38.864
THE MAIN EXCHANGE OF CULTURE

02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:40.799
AND HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT

02:15:40.866 --> 02:15:44.102
CHANGING THE CULTURE. THE MAIN

02:15:44.169 --> 02:15:45.637
CULTURE CHANGE YOUR THEY'RE

02:15:45.704 --> 02:15:47.572
REFERRING TO IS REALLY AROUND-

02:15:47.639 --> 02:15:50.642
FRAUD AND- HOW WE ARE LOOKING

02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:52.444
AT THE BALANCE OF MAKING SURE

02:15:52.511 --> 02:15:54.446
WE PAY PEOPLE YET PROTECT THE

02:15:54.513 --> 02:15:56.681
FUND- AND THAT'S A TRICKY

02:15:56.748 --> 02:15:57.516
BALANCING THAT IS VERY

02:15:57.582 --> 02:15:59.985
DIFFICULT. SO AGAIN AND I THINK

02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:01.386
PART OF OUR CULTURAL CHANGE

02:16:01.453 --> 02:16:03.154
WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE AS

02:16:03.221 --> 02:16:04.623
WITH THE HIRE OF A NEW

02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:06.224
EXECUTIVE TEAM. THAT I

02:16:06.291 --> 02:16:07.959
MENTIONED EARLIER WITH OUR NEED

02:16:08.026 --> 02:16:09.294
TO CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTORS AS

02:16:09.361 --> 02:16:12.430
WELL AS A NEW CHIEF COUNSEL-

02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:15.834
AND NEW LEADS DIRECTOR- HAVE

02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:17.903
ALREADY SHOWN IMPROVEMENT BUT

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:20.805
THE BRAND. NEW FRESH IDEAS AND

02:16:20.872 --> 02:16:23.208
A NEW LOOK AT THINGS SO I

02:16:23.275 --> 02:16:25.443
WELCOME THAT AND- THERE THEY'VE

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.345
ALREADY BEEN EXTRAORDINARY AND

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:28.613
WE'RE GETTING IN AND MAKING

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.982
SURE THAT- IS REFLECTIVE IN A

02:16:31.049 --> 02:16:34.386
CULTURE. THAT WE'RE ALL PROUD

02:16:34.452 --> 02:16:37.122
OF. SO THEN I DON'T WANT. HEY

02:16:37.188 --> 02:16:38.356
BENEFITS SINCE AND SPEAKING OF

02:16:38.423 --> 02:16:39.925
THE FROM ISSUE. AND GIVEN THE

02:16:39.991 --> 02:16:41.259
FACT THAT IT WITH YOUR YOUR

02:16:41.326 --> 02:16:43.595
MORE. AS AS IT WAS POINTED OUT

02:16:43.662 --> 02:16:44.729
WITH SOME OF THE PREVIOUS

02:16:44.796 --> 02:16:47.966
QUESTIONS THAT MORE OF THE- IT

02:16:48.033 --> 02:16:49.601
SEEMS LIKE THE APPROACH AND THE

02:16:49.668 --> 02:16:53.071
LEANING WAS TO- NOT PAY AND

02:16:53.138 --> 02:16:54.773
ASSUME THAT THERE'S FRAUD AND

02:16:54.839 --> 02:16:56.474
SO VERY FEW GO THROUGH EXHAUST

02:16:56.541 --> 02:16:59.044
THE VERIFICATION. WHERE WAS

02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:01.146
THAT COMING FROM WAS THERE A

02:17:01.212 --> 02:17:03.381
HIGH RATE OF INCIDENCE. FOR A

02:17:03.448 --> 02:17:06.117
FRAUD OR WAS IT- THE

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:08.386
SPECIALIZED IN SPECIFIC REGIONS

02:17:08.453 --> 02:17:10.889
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHAT WAS.

02:17:10.956 --> 02:17:11.723
WHERE WAS THAT THINKING AN

02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:14.859
APPROACH BASED ON YEAH THAT

02:17:14.926 --> 02:17:16.828
THOSE ARE PERCEPTION- AND LIKE

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:17.829
I SAID IT IS A VERY HARD

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:20.332
BALANCE- I THINK WE'RE REALLY-

02:17:20.398 --> 02:17:21.533
FOCUSED IN WAS A COUPLE YEARS

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:23.134
AGO THERE IS A NATIONAL IT'S

02:17:23.201 --> 02:17:25.103
CALLED SPRING BREAK BREAK CASE

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:26.705
AND HIT THE UNEMPLOYMENT ASSIST

02:17:26.771 --> 02:17:28.473
AND- INSURANCE PROGRAMS HARD

02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:30.375
THROUGHOUT THE NATION-

02:17:30.442 --> 02:17:33.044
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR HAS- WAS

02:17:33.111 --> 02:17:33.945
THE ONE THAT REALLY LED THE

02:17:34.012 --> 02:17:35.313
CHARGE AND WORKING WITH ALL THE

02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:37.115
STATE'S. BUT THAT'S WHEN WE

02:17:37.182 --> 02:17:38.483
REALLY STARTED A COUPLE YEARS

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:39.718
AGO WE REALLY STARTED SEE AN

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:43.188
INFLUX OF- PEOPLE HAVING OTHER

02:17:43.254 --> 02:17:45.056
PEOPLE'S ID AND OTHER

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:47.292
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SO THEY

02:17:47.359 --> 02:17:49.094
COULD INFILTRATE OUR SYSTEMS

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:51.129
WORKING REALLY BAD WAS WHEN

02:17:51.196 --> 02:17:53.164
CONGRESS PASSED THE PANDEMIC

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:54.566
UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:56.134
IMPLEMENTED THAT BECAUSE IT HAS

02:17:56.201 --> 02:17:56.935
VERY LITTLE CHECKS AND

02:17:57.002 --> 02:17:59.704
BALANCES- AND MADE IT JUST YOU

02:17:59.771 --> 02:18:01.706
KNOW UNFORTUNATELY. THE

02:18:01.773 --> 02:18:03.708
ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT THAT THAT

02:18:03.775 --> 02:18:05.577
THE INCENTIVE WAS TO MAKE SURE

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:07.112
EVERYONE GETS PAID AND THAT WAS

02:18:07.178 --> 02:18:09.014
WHAT THEIR FOCUS ON THE%

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:10.382
DOWNSTREAM THE FACT WAS THAT

02:18:10.448 --> 02:18:12.150
OPEN THE DOOR FOR FRAUD IN A

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:14.753
WAY THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN

02:18:14.819 --> 02:18:20.191
BEFORE. SO THEN WHAT. WELL OKAY

02:18:20.258 --> 02:18:22.060
I WILL I WILL I DON'T WANT TO

02:18:22.127 --> 02:18:22.627
GET TOO MUCH INTO THE FRONT

02:18:22.694 --> 02:18:29.934
ISSUE RIGHT NOW. GOING BACK TO

02:18:30.001 --> 02:18:32.070
THE CULTURE ISSUE REASON WHY I

02:18:32.137 --> 02:18:35.006
WAS BRINGING IT UP AND YOU YOU

02:18:35.073 --> 02:18:39.744
SAID THAT IT HAS TO DO A LOT

02:18:39.811 --> 02:18:44.549
MORE FOCUS ON FRAUD I. THE

02:18:44.616 --> 02:18:45.950
REASON WHY I WAS BRINGING IT UP

02:18:46.017 --> 02:18:47.118
IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:18:47.185 --> 02:18:50.455
SOMETHING LIKE THE VERY IDEA

02:18:50.522 --> 02:18:53.258
VERIFICATION FOR THE CLAIMANTS

02:18:53.324 --> 02:18:55.427
AND THE FACT THAT THE SCANNER-

02:18:55.493 --> 02:18:57.929
IN THE VERIFICATION UNIT

02:18:57.996 --> 02:18:59.798
COULDN'T DETECT THE RED COLOR.

02:18:59.864 --> 02:19:03.735
AND HAT CREATED QUITE A BIT OF

02:19:03.802 --> 02:19:05.036
A BACKLOG BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS

02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:08.073
NEEDED TO GO IN AND MANUALLY

02:19:08.139 --> 02:19:13.144
CONDUCT THAT. THE REASON MY

02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:15.246
ASSOCIATE THIS WITH CULTURE IS

02:19:15.313 --> 02:19:18.083
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE. WEEKLY

02:19:18.149 --> 02:19:21.052
MEETINGS EXECUTIVE MEETINGS OR

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:21.686
BI WEEKLY OR HOWEVER WAY YOU DO

02:19:21.753 --> 02:19:24.422
IT. YOU DISCUSS DIFFERENT

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:27.459
ISSUES AND YOU SEE THINGS THAT

02:19:27.525 --> 02:19:28.960
YOU CAN POINT OUT TO THAT. ARE

02:19:29.027 --> 02:19:30.695
IN MASS CREATING A PROBLEM AND

02:19:30.762 --> 02:19:32.731
A HOLD UP. M. I AM JUST TRYING

02:19:32.797 --> 02:19:34.999
TO UNDERSTAND. SOMETHING THAT

02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:36.668
MAY HAVE BEEN SO OBVIOUS THAT

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:39.604
COULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. AND

02:19:39.671 --> 02:19:45.009
CREATED SO MUCH BACKLOG. HOW

02:19:45.076 --> 02:19:49.013
WAS THAT NOT READILY SEEN OR OR

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:50.949
COME UP IN YOUR MEETINGS I MEAN

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:52.550
I SUSPECT YOU DO HAVE EXECUTIVE

02:19:52.617 --> 02:19:53.918
MEETINGS ON A RELATIVELY

02:19:53.985 --> 02:19:55.787
FREQUENT BASIS HOW WAS

02:19:55.854 --> 02:19:58.256
SOMETHING LIKE THAT NOT

02:19:58.323 --> 02:20:01.025
IDENTIFIED AND BROUGHT UP. AND

02:20:01.092 --> 02:20:03.962
IT REQUIRED THE A STRIKE TEAM

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:06.898
TO COME IN AND IDENTIFY IT.

02:20:06.965 --> 02:20:09.300
ABSOLUTELY I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

02:20:09.367 --> 02:20:12.303
SAYING SO. THE DEPARTMENT FOR

02:20:12.370 --> 02:20:13.938
THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE HAD A

02:20:14.005 --> 02:20:16.374
PROJECT PORTFOLIO AND WE TRIED

02:20:16.441 --> 02:20:17.842
TO PRIORITIZE ALL THE PROJECTS

02:20:17.909 --> 02:20:20.111
ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE AND APPLY

02:20:20.178 --> 02:20:22.547
RESOURCES AS WE CAN WHO MAKE

02:20:22.614 --> 02:20:25.850
SURE THAT WORK- IMPLEMENTING.

ALL THE APPROVED MENTAL

02:20:27.051 --> 02:20:28.753
DEFICIENCIES BUT LIKE ANY

02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:30.889
DEPARTMENT WEVE GOT MORE WORK

02:20:30.955 --> 02:20:32.190
AND THEN WE HAVE ACTUAL

02:20:32.257 --> 02:20:33.892
RESOURCES AND WHEN THE PANDEMIC

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:35.827
HIT. IT BECAME EVEN MORE

02:20:35.894 --> 02:20:37.929
CHALLENGING THAT'S WHY THE

02:20:37.996 --> 02:20:39.164
STRIKE TEAM CAME IN THEY

02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:41.065
ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN CAME IN AND

02:20:41.132 --> 02:20:43.401
BROUGHT IT DITION RESOURCES-

02:20:43.468 --> 02:20:44.836
BECAUSE I YOU KNOW THERE'S A

02:20:44.903 --> 02:20:46.304
LOT THAT IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH

02:20:46.371 --> 02:20:49.040
OF US THAT WORK- ABLE TO

02:20:49.107 --> 02:20:50.708
ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES SWIFTLY

02:20:50.775 --> 02:20:53.011
ENOUGH. OUR FOCUS OUR PEOPLE

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:55.180
ARE MAINLY ON ACTUALLY PAYING

02:20:55.246 --> 02:20:56.614
THE BENEFITS OF PRODUCING THE

02:20:56.681 --> 02:21:01.586

DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT

02:21:11.663 --> 02:21:14.566
JUST DOESN'T. BUT I'M POINTING

02:21:14.632 --> 02:21:16.467
OUT TO SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC

02:21:16.534 --> 02:21:19.070
THAT. I WOULD HAVE HOPED WHEN

02:21:19.137 --> 02:21:20.839
THIS IS CONTRIBUTING I THINK I

02:21:20.905 --> 02:21:22.440
REMEMBER SOMETHING ABOUT AROUND

02:21:22.507 --> 02:21:25.043
40% OR THIS WAS THIS HAD A

02:21:25.109 --> 02:21:27.812
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE

02:21:27.879 --> 02:21:31.249
LACKING OF THE PROCESS. SOME

02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:33.084
I'M NOT EXACTLY SOMETHING LIKE

02:21:33.151 --> 02:21:35.553
THIS ONE I WOULD HAVE ASSUMED

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:38.122
WOULD HAVE COME UP. RELATIVELY

02:21:38.189 --> 02:21:39.757
QUICKLY OR OR AT LEAST WITHIN A

02:21:39.824 --> 02:21:41.626
MONTH'S PERIOD OF TIME WHEN IT

02:21:41.693 --> 02:21:43.261
BECOMES VERY NOTICEABLE THAT

02:21:43.328 --> 02:21:46.464
THIS IS AN ISSUE. I WOULD

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:47.999
EXPECT AND WE ENCOURAGE OUR

02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:49.734
EMPLOYEES TO- SPEAK TO THEIR

02:21:49.801 --> 02:21:51.236
MANAGERS AND REYES ALL ISSUES

02:21:51.302 --> 02:21:53.438

YEAH I WOULD HOPE SO TOO I'M

02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:05.416
NOT FAMILIAR WITH EXACTLY THE

02:22:05.483 --> 02:22:07.285

02:22:07.352 --> 02:22:09.053
YOU KNOW. ABSOLUTELY WE'RE

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.054

IMPROVEMENTS AND WE ARE IT'S I

02:22:12.624 --> 02:22:14.525
MEAN AS A CONSTANT. OKAY THIS

02:22:14.592 --> 02:22:15.226

PICKING ON SOMETHING RELATIVELY

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:38.883
SIMPLE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.885

HAD A HUGE NUMBER OF CASES OF

02:24:04.302 --> 02:24:06.237
FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR SO SOMEHOW

02:24:06.304 --> 02:24:07.338
EVEN THOUGH THE CULTURE WAS

02:24:07.405 --> 02:24:09.807
VERY MUCHFOCUSED. ON FRAUD

02:24:09.874 --> 02:24:11.109
SOMEHOW THEY THEY MISSED ALL

INTERACTING WITH APARTMENT ARE

02:24:29.894 --> 02:24:32.096
IN NO WAY CONCLUSIVE. AND THEN

02:24:32.163 --> 02:24:33.698
SECONDARILY I WOULDN'T WANT TO

02:24:33.765 --> 02:24:36.834
SEPARATE WITH A LONG STANDING.

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:39.937
FOCUS ON FRAUD PREVENTION PER

02:24:40.004 --> 02:24:41.806
FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR THE

02:24:41.873 --> 02:24:46.077
STATE'S NORMAL UNDERLYING YOU IPROGRAM ON A SEPARATE THAT FROM

02:24:46.144 --> 02:24:47.345
FRAUD THAT'S BEEN SEEN WITH THE

02:24:47.412 --> 02:24:49.547
PO A PROGRAM THAT WAS PASSED AS

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:51.749
PART OF THEIR KERR SACKED

02:24:51.816 --> 02:24:53.151
BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE TO.

02:24:53.217 --> 02:24:55.086
DIFFERENT ISSUES I THINK AND

02:24:55.153 --> 02:24:58.423
ARGUE SO FIRST RELATED TO. THE

02:24:58.489 --> 02:25:00.058
LONGSTANDING FOCUS ON FRAUD

02:25:00.124 --> 02:25:02.427
PREVENTION. IN IN IN MY

02:25:02.493 --> 02:25:03.394
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:04.562
DEPARTMENT AND EXPERIENCE

02:25:04.629 --> 02:25:06.497
WORKING WITH DVD IT'S CLEAR

02:25:06.564 --> 02:25:08.733
THAT. THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:10.134
READING INCENTIVES FROM THE

02:25:10.201 --> 02:25:11.869
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PERTAINING

02:25:11.936 --> 02:25:13.871
TO MINIMIZING THE NUMBER OF

02:25:13.938 --> 02:25:16.541
OVERPAYMENTS- THAT ISSUES AND

02:25:16.607 --> 02:25:17.675
THAT GUIDANCE COMES FROM THE

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:20.611
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. AND AS ALL

02:25:20.678 --> 02:25:21.946
STATE DEPARTMENTS DO THAT ARE

02:25:22.013 --> 02:25:23.314
THAT ARE INTERACTING WITH WITH

02:25:23.381 --> 02:25:25.116
FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS THAT THAT

02:25:25.183 --> 02:25:26.617
DICTATE RULES AND REGULATIONS

02:25:26.684 --> 02:25:28.352
THAT THAT THE PART WAS TAKING

02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:29.787
EFFORTS TO MEET THOSE.

02:25:29.854 --> 02:25:32.123
INCENTIVES AND MESSAGES FROM

02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:33.057
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT

02:25:33.124 --> 02:25:34.258
SAID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:25:34.325 --> 02:25:37.095
ALSO EQUALLY PRIORITIZES THE

02:25:37.161 --> 02:25:40.131
PROMPT PAYMENT OF BENEFITS AND-

02:25:40.198 --> 02:25:41.299
SO WHEN WE COMPARED THE

02:25:41.365 --> 02:25:45.169
DEPARTMENT'S TREATMENT OF THOSE

02:25:45.236 --> 02:25:48.272
TO. HAVE WHAT'S SAY- TARGETS

02:25:48.339 --> 02:25:50.441
THAT THAT MAY BE IN OPPOSITION

02:25:50.508 --> 02:25:52.477
OR OR IMBALANCED- IT APPEARS

02:25:52.543 --> 02:25:54.579
THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TENDED

02:25:54.645 --> 02:25:55.780
TO PREFER FOCUSING ON FRAUD

02:25:55.847 --> 02:26:00.218
PREVENTION RELATIVE TO ISSUING-

02:26:00.284 --> 02:26:01.919
BENEFIT PAYMENTS IN A TIMELY

02:26:01.986 --> 02:26:03.521
FASHION. NOW TO THE SECOND

02:26:03.588 --> 02:26:05.790
POINT MR TANG RELATED TO FRAUD

02:26:05.857 --> 02:26:07.225
THAT'S RECENTLY BEEN BEEN

02:26:07.291 --> 02:26:09.360
UNCOVERED IN THE P. WAY PROGRAM

02:26:09.427 --> 02:26:11.095
AS BOTH THE THAT SECRETARY

02:26:11.162 --> 02:26:12.897
RICHARDSON AND- DIRECTOR SO

02:26:12.964 --> 02:26:15.099
YOU'D MENTIONED THE FEDERAL

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:17.135
PROGRAM RECENTLY STOOD UP

02:26:17.201 --> 02:26:19.804
INCLUDED VERY FEW STEPS THAT

02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:20.938
WOULD LIMIT THIS SORT OF

02:26:21.005 --> 02:26:24.475
ACTIVITY- IF- A FRAUDULENT

02:26:24.542 --> 02:26:27.145
ACTOR HAD OBTAINED- IDENTIFYING

02:26:27.211 --> 02:26:28.079
INFORMATION FROM A PREVIOUS

02:26:28.146 --> 02:26:29.714
DATA BREACH. THEY COULD SUBMIT

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:31.015
THAT INFORMATION THROUGH THE

02:26:31.082 --> 02:26:33.151
REQUIREMENTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW

02:26:33.217 --> 02:26:35.353
FOR THE P. YOU A PROGRAM AND

02:26:35.419 --> 02:26:36.587
THE CLAIM COULD GO THROUGH

02:26:36.654 --> 02:26:38.256
CLEANLY THERE WOULD BE NOTHING

02:26:38.322 --> 02:26:39.323
BUILT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE

02:26:39.390 --> 02:26:40.925
CLAIM TO CATCH THAT FRAUDULENT

02:26:40.992 --> 02:26:43.828
ACTIVITY. NOW WHEN ET DE DID

02:26:43.895 --> 02:26:45.630
BEGIN NOTICING THE TRENDS IN

02:26:45.696 --> 02:26:46.931
THIS FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY

02:26:46.998 --> 02:26:48.866
MULTIPLE CLAIMS GOING TO A

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:50.902
SINGLE ADDRESS I'M JUST LOOKING

02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:52.069
AT THE TRENDS LINES IN THE

02:26:52.136 --> 02:26:53.171
NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THERE

02:26:53.237 --> 02:26:55.506
WERE SOME INCONSISTENCIES. THEY

02:26:55.573 --> 02:27:00.745
TOOK SEVERAL STEPS TO NOT ONLY.

02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:01.913
STEP ESTABLISHED PRODUCERS AT

02:27:01.979 --> 02:27:03.648
THE AT THE OUTSET BUT ALSO TO

02:27:03.714 --> 02:27:04.815
REDUCE THE INCENTIVES SO THAT

02:27:04.882 --> 02:27:05.883
THE MAIN STEP THAT I WANT TO

02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:07.351
POINT OUT IS THAT THAT THE

02:27:07.418 --> 02:27:10.621
DEPARTMENT- STOPS AUTOMATICALLY

02:27:10.688 --> 02:27:12.490
CERTIFYING PRIOR WEEKS BENEFIT

02:27:12.557 --> 02:27:14.659

02:27:16.327 --> 02:27:18.129
BACKDATED CLAIM UNDER THE POOL

02:27:18.196 --> 02:27:20.097
PROGRAM NOW- THERE'S ANOTHER

02:27:20.164 --> 02:27:21.999
TOUCH POINT WITH PD TO CONFIRM

02:27:22.066 --> 02:27:24.068
THE IDENTITY OF THAT CLAIM AND-

02:27:24.135 --> 02:27:26.137
AND THIS PREVENTS. A FRAUDULENT

02:27:26.204 --> 02:27:28.573
ACTOR FROM CLAIMING SAY FIFTEEN

02:27:28.639 --> 02:27:29.974
OR TWENTY WEEKS OF BACK

02:27:30.041 --> 02:27:31.375
PAYMENTS WHICH IS WHY YOU WERE

02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:34.045
SAYING TEN TWELVE FIFTEEN

02:27:34.111 --> 02:27:34.912
THOUSAND DOLLAR EDT DEBIT

02:27:34.979 --> 02:27:37.181
CARDS- THAT WERE BEING USED

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:40.051
FRAUDULENTLY ALL SIGNS INDICATE

02:27:40.117 --> 02:27:42.086
AS OF NOW THAT THAT STEP.

02:27:42.153 --> 02:27:43.154
FATHER WAS INSTITUTED SEVERAL

02:27:43.221 --> 02:27:44.722
WEEKS AGO BY THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:27:44.789 --> 02:27:45.856
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE

02:27:45.923 --> 02:27:48.159
NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS- FOR THE

02:27:48.226 --> 02:27:50.194

CONFUSING. THEY DEMONSTRATE

02:38:02.439 --> 02:38:04.208
THAT THE DATA IS NOT EASILY

02:38:04.274 --> 02:38:08.312

02:38:08.378 --> 02:38:11.148
TOO AGAIN TO HAVE IT ON ALL OF

02:38:11.215 --> 02:38:13.483

SPENDING TIME ON YOUR WEBSITE

02:38:25.896 --> 02:38:27.865

02:38:27.931 --> 02:38:29.766
WHAT THEY WOULD BE LOOKING AT

02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:12.749
YOU WOULD THINK. THAT YOU

02:53:12.815 --> 02:53:13.816
