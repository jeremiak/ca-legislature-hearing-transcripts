THEYTOO HAVE FACED HOSPITAL CLOSURES IN THEIR DISTRICTS. A HOSPITAL DECISION TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE SERVICES CREATE SERIOUS CHALLENGES FOR COMMUNITY UNFORTUNATELY THE NOTIFICATION TIME FRAMES REQUIRED BY EXISTING LAW ARE SIMPLY NOT SUFFICIENT.

TO PREVENT THE CLOSURE OF A CRITICAL HOSPITAL THAT WAS A SITUATION OF MY DISTRICT THE TIMELINE JUST WASN'T LONG ENOUGH TO FIND ANOTHER OPERATOR. AT THE VERY LEAST THIS BILL ALLOWS PATIENTS THE RESIDENTS TO BETTER PREPARE FOR THEIR NEXT EMERGENCY NOW THAT THERE LOCAL HOSPITAL IS GONE AND ALSO PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE PARAMEDICS -- HAVE TO PLAN AS WELL A FIRE DEPARTMENTS WITH THAT -- HERE TO TESTIFY MAYBE IS TAYLOR JACKSON OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION SHE MAY BE EN ROUTE IF NOT -- WE MAY PROCEED I HOPE HI THERE.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I'M SURE EVERYONE'S AWARE OF THE DEVASTATING CAMPFIRE THAT OCCURRED IN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR WAS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE CAN'T FIRE IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY. ALSO THE DEADLIEST IN THE MOST COSTLY IS DESERT NATIONAL DISASTER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I THINK A NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WERE ALONG ON THE LEGISLATIVE TOUR OF THE TOWN OF PARADISE IN JANUARY IT WAS INCREDIBLY POIGNANT. TO DRIVE THROUGH THOSE DEVASTATED NEIGHBORHOODS AND SEE ENTIRE HOUSING TRACTS BURNED TO THE GROUND. ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING THINGS ABOUT THAT TOUR WAS THAT THE WE HAD TESTIMONY FROM THE FIRST RESPONDERS ABOUT THE LACK OF EGRESS IN PARADISE SO PARADISE HAS. FOR EGRESS ROUTES ALL OF THEM WERE COMPLETELY PACKED WITH CARS BECAUSE OF THE RAPID SPREAD OF THAT FIRE. AND THEY TOLD US STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE SHELTERING IN PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTIONS AND THANK GOODNESS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAT DEATH TOLL WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HIGHER. WE HAVE MANY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WITH EVEN WORSE EGRESS THEM PARADISE -- I LIVE IN A TOWN WITH ONLY THREE EGRESS ROUTES THERE ARE MANY WITH ONLY TWO OR EVEN. ONE SO THIS BILL WILL CREATE A VERY EARLY VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW EGRESS ROUTES THOSE ARE ONLY IN CASES WHERE. THE BOARD OF FORESTRY HAVE DETAILS DETERMINE THAT THERE IS A DIRE NEED AND THE AMENDMENTS TAKE A NATURAL COMMITTEE NARROW THE BILL SO IT IS VERY SPECIFICALLY TARGET JUST THOSE PROJECTS SO I THINK IT'S A WERE THE BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE A THANK YOU. SPEARS IN SUPPORT. YOUR SINGLE PARTY WITH A CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION -- WE BELIEVE THESE CHANGES ARE INTENDED TO APPROVE EGRESS ROUTE SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY.

JACK ANDERSON WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S SIXTY ONE LOCAL DEPARTMENTS AND SUPPORT. ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR -- CAPPING LYNCH REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION WE'RE NOT REALLY HERE OPPOSED TO THE POLICY -- WHAT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT WE JUST CHANGE THIS LAW LAST YEAR? WE JUST PUT INTO EFFECT NEW WARNING LABELS THAT ARE REQUIRED ON PACKAGING. THAT JUST WENT INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY AND NOW WE'RE CHANGING IT YET AGAIN THIS IMPACTS. ALL THE INDUSTRIES THAT SHIP IN THE CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S A BUSINESS IMPACT THEIR BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT I WANT. TO INFORM THE COMMITTEE OF IS THAT THE NATIONAL SHOOTING WE ALWAYS GET CRITICIZED FOR NOT DOING THINGS. BUDGET AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS A FISCAL YESTERDAY ON MEANS OF HOW IT AFFECTS THE STATE FISCALLY IS IS WHAT YOU'RE WELL. YEAH BUT WHAT I WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION AND THE AMERICAN SO SUS. SOCIETY FOR A SUICIDE PREVENTION HAVE JOINTLY SPONSORED A PROGRAM NATIONWIDE TO GET INFORMATION OUT ABOUT SUICIDE PREVENTION INCLUDING ALL KINDS OF COMMUNICATION. THAT'S POSTED EVERYWHERE AT RETAIL AND THIS BILL ACTUALLY COULD UNDERMINE THAT BECAUSE YOU TO HAVE CONFUSING POSTING THEY MIGHT PULL OUT THEIR ADVERTISING IN CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW THAT -- THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN IS CONCERNED ABOUT VETERANS IN PARTICULAR AND THAT THE INFORMATION IN THE SUICIDE PROGRAM THAT OUTLINED COVERS VETERAN TESTS HOTLINE NUMBERS IT HAS A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS. SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT TO THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS WORK IS UNDER WAY IT'S REACHING A LOT OF FOLKS AND I'D HATE FOR CALIFORNIA TO GET CUT OUT OF THE EQUATION THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FILE. WE DON'T CLOSE -- I'M SORRY YEAH. THE AUTHOR COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT COMPONENT BECAUSE AS I UNDERSTAND IT. A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT ARE TO BE ASKED ABOUT. MENTAL HEALTH ACTUALLY ALREADY EXIST IN THE CURRENT -- ACTIONS LIKE IF YOU GO TO PURCHASE A GUN AND YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN AWHILE BUT YOU THE TICKET COUNTER SAFETY COURSE YOU DON'T HAVE PROOF. IF YOU TAKE A THIRTY QUESTION TEST IT DOES IDENTIFIED THE QUESTIONS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN THERE YOUR BILL REALLY PERTAINS MORE TO SPECIFIC -- SIGNING COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT. OF YES I CAN ADDRESSES SO I MEAN THE BACKGROUND IS THAT I HAD A DEPUTY FROM MY DISTRICT APPROACH ME -- HIS BROTHER WHO IS A VETERAN HAD TESTS -- COMMITTED SUICIDE USING A GUN AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE SAID WAS THAT THE HE DID NOT HAVE QUICK ACCESS -- TO ANY SERVICES SO THE THE NATIONAL SUICIDE HOTLINE HAS -- IF HE HAD JUST HAD THAT NUMBER AND BEEN ABLE TO PUSH ONE FOR VETERANS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN. SOME INFORMATION. THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED THEM AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HIS BROTHER THINGS SO THIS IS THIS IS -- THIS WOULD BE A SEPARATE SIGN THAT YOU JUST HAS THE THE SUICIDE HOTLINE NUMBER. IT WOULD BE -- THE PHONE NUMBER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE EXAM AND IT WOULD BE -- PACKAGING GOING FORWARD THAT JUST SAYS NATIONAL SO AT ALL THE SUICIDE HOTLINE NUMBER. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I I APPRECIATE FOR THE CLARITY. RIGHT NOW AND YOU KNOW THE APPROPRIATIONS AND ALSO STATES THAT THERE ARE NEGLIGIBLE COSTS SAID BUT I THINK THIS IS THIS COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION -- THAT CONSISTENT INDIVIDUAL IN CRISIS SELF RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MICHAEL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING AFFORD THAT GETS OUT ON A ROLL CALL.
