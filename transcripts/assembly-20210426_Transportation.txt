THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OKAY- WILL NOT BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM AS A MEMBER DAVIES THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO FIRST OF ALL THERE'S NO ARGUMENT PUBLIC SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. MY QUESTION IS IF YOU COULD JUST CLARIFY ON IN REGARDS TO- HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE BASICALLY- TWO TIMES- YOU KNOW BEING PULLED OVER CHECK FOR INFECTION IS THIS IF YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A DRIVER'S LICENSE YOU JUST DIDN'T RENEW IT OR WOULD BE IF SOMEONE THAT DID EVEN EVER GET THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE TWO INFRACTIONS. OKAY LET ME LET ME SEE WHAT THE BILL DOESN'T HOPEFULLY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION BASICALLY SAYING IS IF YOU HAVE AN INFRACTION YOU SHOULD HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE TAKEN AWAY SO THAT HAPPENS- THE FIRST TIME AS I AS I UNDERSTAND WRITTEN THE WAY WE DRIVE TODAY- YOU GET A HUNDRED DOLLARS OF HAPPENED A SECOND TIME. MEANING- THE GET ANOTHER DOLLARS IN THE FOURTH SORRY THE THIRD ONE- WOULD BE- FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS- BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY NAY I WOULD TELL YOU. OTHER THINGS A JUDGE CAN DO OR THE COURTS CAN DO BECAUSE- OFTENTIMES PEOPLE SAY WHAT THE TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE I TEMPOR SAYS BUT THERE'S- THERE ARE. FINES IF YOU COULD NOT- INCREASE UP TO FIFTY PERCENT. I CAN SEND FTD BUT WHAT THE CORE OF THIS REALLY IS TRYING TO DO IN THE DOES HAPPEN MYSELF ALMOST RECENTLY- OR I- GOT A SPEEDING AND- THE IN MY CASE I WAS ABLE TO CATCH- THE DATE OF WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO COURT. AND THE HOME OF MISTY BUT TO A MISSED IT- AND HAVE MY DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENDED SIMPLY BECAUSE I WON A FEW. EXTRA A LITTLE BIT FASTER THAN I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE- MAKES NO SENSE IN PARTICULAR WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT SOME- LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN WITH OUR LANGUAGE BARRIERS. IT'S A HARSH PENALTY TO TAKE SOMEBODY'S- LICENSE AWAY. OVER AN INFRACTION SO. I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY IT IS. I WANNA DANCE QUESTIONS I. OKAY THANK YOU AND- THE CAN JUST CLARIFYING THIS TWENTY IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT THE DO YOU AYE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AS WELL THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD THE WAY WE DRAFTED IS IT STILL ALLOWS FOR THE JUDGES HAVE DISCRETION OVER CERTAIN CATEGORIES- OF INFRACTIONS IN THOSE WOULD INCLUDE- DO YOU EYES RECKLESS DRIVING AND CAUSING BODILY HARM. THE REALLY WHEN TRAINING OUT HERE IS. SOMEBODY FOR SOME MISFORTUNE MAKES A RIGHT HAND TURN. AND FOR SOME MISFORTUNE CANNOT ATTEND. A COURT HEARING DATE AND THEN HAS A- LICENSE. SUSPENSION WHICH HAVE CAUSED MUCH GRAVER DAMAGE AND ULTIMATELY CUT COSTS. US A LOT MORE THAN TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I ADDRESSED EXACTLY WHICH SETS OF THOSE THREE CATEGORIES OF JUST HOW TO SCRATCH. OKAY AND THEN AGAIN JUST ONE PLAYER FIND THIS WOULD BE IF YOU HAD YOUR YOUR WHEN YOU GOT YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE AND SAY WAS SUSPENDED OR OR SOMETHING LIKE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT IF SOMEONE IS PULLED OVER NEVER GOT A DRIVER'S LICENSE DOES THAT PERTAIN TO THAT AS WELL- WELL THEY NEVER HAD A DRIVER'S LICENSE IT WOULD BE SUSPENDED. YOU WANT RECESSED SPENDING IT. AT THE COURTS FOR NOT FOR SHOWING UP FOR A FRACTION. OKAY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE WINTER BE DIFFERENT. OF THEIR CAUGHT DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE DOT. HAVE GOTTEN. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPROVED. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I AM GOING TO ASK ANY THE MEMBERS WHO WERE OUT OF THE ROOM TO COME BACK IN SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM PLEASE AND WE CAN. ACTUALLY VOTE ON THIS BILL. I MISTER SANTIAGO I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL I WAS CONCERNED ORIGINALLY. THAT WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAD THEIR LICENSE SUSPENDED FOR. DRUNK DRIVING OR FOR. RECKLESS DRIVING BE ABLE TO DRIVE AROUND WITHOUT THAT LICENSE UP. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT A DRIVER'S LICENSE IS DRIVING IS A PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT. AND THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN BASIC LEVEL OF. COMPETENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY TO DO IT. BUT THIS BILL NOW HAS BEEN NARROWED. TO FAILURE TO APPEAR AND LEFT UP TO THE DISCRETION OF A JUDGE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. THAT OFFENSE WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR SO I THINK THAT IT DOES- REALLY HELP PEOPLE WHO. REALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO STILL DRIVE- DO SO BUT KEEP DANGEROUS DRIVERS OFF THE ROAD SO I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE AMENDMENTS WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- CAN WE- WHAT'S ESTABLISH A TERRIBLE WE CALL RECALL.

FLEEING VEHICLE AND INTO A TRUE AND FOR I CAN RECOVERY GROWTH OF HIGH CALL JOBS DISADVANTAGED WORKERS BY ENSURING THAT PUBLIC FUNDING TO PURCHASE CLEANER VEHICLES IF TIED TO LABOR STANDARDS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT THAT THE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS THESE CHANGES INCLUDE AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS. EXCLUSIVELY AT EXEMPTING OFF ROAD VEHICLE THE THOMAS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ALLOW TIME FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE NATIONAL CONTENT STANDARDS AND DIRECT CARP TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY TO SET ACHIEVABLE STANDARD ON DOMESTIC- CONTENT AND ALSO GIVE CARD THE ABILITY TO POSTPONE STANDARDS THAT ARE NOT FEASIBLE MODIFY THE REPAYMENT PROVISIONS OF INCENTIVES AND NARAL COMPLIANCE TO SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF LABOR LAW AND ALLOW FOR THE AN APPEALS.

CLIMATE INVESTMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE STRATEGIES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE COVER NINETEEN DOWNTURN IN THE GOVERNOR'S THE CLIMATE EXECUTIVE ORDER HAVE MADE THESE INVESTMENTS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ECONOMIC EQUITY AND CLIMATE TOOLS THIS BILL INCORPORATES HIGH ROAD WORKFORCE STANDARDS AND TO CALIFORNIA'S NEW CLEAN VEHICLE INCENTIVE DOLLARS. THESE STANDARDS WILL LEVERAGE HIGH ROAD HIGH ROAD JOBS FOR DISADVANTAGED AND DISLOCATED WORKERS IN VEHICLE MANUFACTURING BATTERY PRODUCTION AND TRUCK DRIVING WORKFORCE STANDARDS GUARANTEE THE REPUBLIC DOLLARS DELIVER. AT WE NEED TO STRONG CALIFORNIA WORK. AND YOU WERE CALLA JOB IN THE CVV TRANSIT. THIS IS BECAUSE THAT COME PUBLIC THE AND- COMPANIES TO FOR AT THEIR FOR. DELIVER HIKES JOB AND TAKE A- FOR MISSION. THE AUTO AND AS A STORE OF A MONEY FOR TO AND NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. AND ONE ONE MILLION. PEOPLE NATIONWIDE. BUT JOB QUALITY IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED BY OFFSHORING RELIANCE ON TEMPORARY WORKERS. ATTACKS ON WORKERS FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND WEEKEND HEALTH AND SAFETY ENFORCEMENT. I WANT TO JUST FOR INFLATION. WAGES WERE PUT. WORKERS IN OTTAWA AND AUTO PARTS OF DECLINE BY OVER 20% IN THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. THIS IS WHY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO AUTO COMPANIES NEED TO INCENTIVIZE. HIGH QUALITY JOBS THAT ARE BASED IN THE UNITED STATES. AND LOS ANGELES PORK TRUCK COURT TRUCKERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOVING ALMOST HALF OF THE NATION'S CONTAINER IMPORTS. OF THE ALLEY PORTS IN CALIFORNIA HAS OTHER AFTER PORTS WITH MAJOR TRUCKING OPERATIONS AS WELL. PORCH ROCKING AND SHORT HAUL TRUCKING GENERALLY ARE HOME TO AGREED TO DISMISS CLASSIFICATION OF CONTRACTORS. BY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS BETWEEN 7290% OF DRAYAGE TRUCK DRIVERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED MAKING THIS THE DOMINANT BUSINESS MODEL IN THE INDUSTRY. POLICIES AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO UPGRADE FLEETS WITHOUT LABOR STANDARDS PUNISH HARDWORKING DRIVERS AND INSURANCE MATH CLASSIFICATION. USA TODAY CALLED CONDITIONS AT THE LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH PORTS MODERN DAY INDENTURED SERVITUDE. AFTER THE FIRST CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAM.

FROM EXTREME WORKER EXPLOITATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL NON COMPLIANCE TO HIGH ROAD JOBS IN CLEAN VEHICLES THAT DON'T POLLUTE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LIKE THE ONES THAT I REPRESENT. MY DISTRICT IS SURROUNDED BY THE FIVE THE TEN THE SIXTY THE ONE TEN THE TO THE ONE THIRTY FOUR. AND PERHAPS THE SEVEN TEN ANOTHER SEVEN MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN. WE ARE SURROUNDED BY FREEWAYS AND BETTER QUALITY. I THOUGHT AB SEVEN NINE FOUR CREATES A PATHWAY TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS AND FLEETS. PRESERVING GROW HIGH QUALITY US IN CALIFORNIA JOBS AND AUTO MANUFACTURING BY TYING WORKFORCE STANDARDS TWO INCENTIVE DOLLARS. THIS BILL HELPS PRODUCE MUCH CLASSIFICATION OF TRUCK DRIVERS AND GUARANTEE THAT OUR PRECIOUS. PUBLIC INVESTMENTS DON'T SUBSIDIZE COMPANIES THAT ILLEGALLY CLASSIFY THEIR WORKERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS STILL THEIR WAGES AND FAIL TO COMPLY WITH OUR STATE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. ADDITIONALLY AB SEVEN NINE FOUR ENCOURAGES MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE VEHICLES USING STATE OR FEDERAL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS OPERATOR TRAINING PROGRAM OR PROVIDE A BLUEPRINT. FOR HOW THEY EXPECT TO DELIVER TRAINING TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL WORKPLACE SKILLS. AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT OF AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION CALIFORNIA CANNOT AFFORD TO FAIL ON COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES TO SOURCE LOCALLY. BOTH LOCAL AND NATIONAL ECONOMIES AND BUILD OUT CRITICAL MANUFACTURING SUPPLY CHAINS WITH EQUITY. AND JOB QUALITY GUARANTEES FOR THE JOBS FOR THE FUTURE AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY.

LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THEY'RE THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLLUTION.

WAREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION CENTRES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE OR NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THE AUTHOR REFERENCE BETTER SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY THREE WAY. SO THE PRIMARY OF AB SEVEN NINETY. IS THAT THE STATE CLIMACOOL. ARE IN EXTRA LINKED TO ECONOMIC JUSTICE GOAL. IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS INEQUALITY AND EXPLOITATION THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF A MORE GREEN ECONOMY. AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES IT TIED TOGETHER AND LINK LABOR STANDARDS WE ARE IN THE- GOALS WHICH ARE. THE OTHER SPOKE ABOUT THE MEDICAL. OF PORT DRIVERS. AND WHY IS SO TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE PORK CHOPS ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF EMISSIONS AND THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO MEET CLIMATE GOALS DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON COMPLETE PURCHASERS TRANSITIONING TO ZERO EMISSION TRUCKING FLEET. YET A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS IS THE MIDDLE. OF PORT TRUCK RIVERS AND THE REASON IS THAT MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS ARE MAKING THE MINIMUM WAGE AND A BARELY TAKING HOME ENOUGH MONEY TO SURVIVE AFTER THEY PAID FOR THE GAP AND MAINTENANCE. OF THEIR EXISTING TRUCK. THE DRIVERS NOT. THE COMPANY SEGMENTS. THEM BY THE THAT HAVE TO BEAR COST OF BY A ZERO EMISSIONS.

OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITHOUT WILL GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAS QUESTIONS. FRAZIER FONG. A DESERVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- TO THE AUTHOR- I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD- GIVE US AN EXPLANATION OF WHY- WHY WILL WHAT THE CARP ROUTE IN TERMS OF- BEING THAT THE- THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE LABOR MORE POOR STANDARDS- AS OPPOSED TO THE CALLOSUM. DEMI THIS CAR HAVE THE BANDWIDTH. TO EVALUATE LABOR COMPLIANCE- TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE THINKING BEHIND. THAT DECISION. SURE MADAM THIRTY WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO. THANK YOU- SO RIGHT NOW I'LL BE CALIFORNIA LABOR COMMISSIONER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND INFLUENCE TO ACTUALLY- SEE HOW MANY LABOR VIOLATIONS ARE CURRENTLY- IN PROCESS- AND HOW MANY OF THE- ASSIST THE TRUCK DRIVERS ARE IN ASSOCIATION ALSO AND NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH LABOR LAW. HOWEVER THOSE REPORTS ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH CARP THE GOAL WHICH I THINK WAS MENTIONED I'M IN ONE OF THE CALLS THAT WERE WITNESSES IN THAT CAR WAS ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT- CHALLENGED AND PASSED WITH TRULY DEFINING CALIFORNIA'S. EMISSION GOALS AND CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ALIGNMENT TOGETHER SO THAT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS CARP PASSED THE DATA THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE THAT'S WHY WE'VE ALSO ADDED A FOR YOUR PROVISION. AND ALL OF THE PROVISIONS AND AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT CAR HAS THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW WE MOVE THIS FORWARD. OKAY DO YOU MIND MOVING A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MIKE THAT'S A REALLY HARD TO HEAR YOU BACK HERE CHECK. SORRY ABOUT THAT THANK AYE SO I. I CAN. I CAN APPRECIATE- THAT SENTIMENT I GUESS THAT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE. WELL WE'RE LINKING TWO THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF APPLES AND ORANGES SO YOU HAVE I'M SORRY WHAT TO THINK THAT WHAT WE WERE LINKING TO THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO SAY WE HAVE WE'RE LOOKING LIVE OVER FOR STANDARDS TO LIKE EVEY INCENTIVES- WHICH WOULD GO TO THE CONSUMER NOT TO THE MANUFACTURERS SO WE'RE- WE'RE- WE'RE KIND OF. PUTTING THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER SO I GUESS THAT IS A MAYBE IT LEADS TO MY SECOND QUESTION IS THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS BILL REQUIRES THE MANUFACTURER. TO REIMBURSE THE STATE IN THE EVENT THAT IS A VIOLATION. EVEN THOUGH THE EEVEE INCENTIVES GO TO THE CONSUMERS NOT THE MAIN FACTORS SO I WAS MAYBE YOU CAN- EXPLAINED. THAT THE THOUGHT PROCESS THERE SO PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT ARE USE FOR ANY TYPE OF INCENTIVE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. IS ALONG THE REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT A JUST TRANSITION. SO AS LARGEST. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT WHAT A JUST TRANSITION OF WORKERS LOOKS LIKE FIVE YOU'RE SEEN THAT PLAY OUT IN THE CONVERSATION AROUND FOSSIL FUELS AND FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS AND THE WORKERS THAT% WORK AT. REFINERY THIS IS A VERY SIMILAR CONVERSATION AND IT SEEMS A LITTLE STRANGE BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY HAS NEVER BEEN DONE. PART OF THE COMMENTARY THAT I RECEIVED ON THIS BILL. EVEN WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT PRIORITIES FOR SOME OF THE CAUCUSES IS THIS A LABOR BILL. OR IS THIS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BILL IT'S BOTH. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE SITUATION AND CONUNDRUM THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN. IS THAT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO ADDRESS TRANSITION OF WORKERS. AND ENSURE THAT THE WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES A GOOD JOB. INCENTIVES BENEFITS ALL OF THOSE THINGS WITHOUT BEING MISCLASSIFIED. AND TYING IT INTO LABOR LAW AND TYING IT INTO ONE OF OUR MENTAL CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. THAT THE FAITH THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN. AND THAT'S WHY YES IT'S NEW IT'S INNOVATIVE IT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE AND THOSE ARE. THE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK YOU AND I ANOTHER CONVERSATION HAVE ALSO TRIED TO ANSWER. AND SO WE HOPE THAT THIS IS. IF YOU KNOW ALL SITUATION GIVEN THEY HAD MOVED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IS THAT IT ACTUALLY SET THE TONE IT ACTUALLY SET THE PATHWAY. OF THE OF A JUST TRANSITION AND WHAT THAT COULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE BOTH FOR WORKERS FOR EMPLOYERS AND FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THIS WOULD APPLY TO ALL MANUFACTURERS. CORRECT YES IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY I HAD- I AM. I GUESS I'M I'M I'M A LITTLE UNEASY SO I MEAN I PLAYED BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS THANK YOU SURE- I WAS% NOTIFIED THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE LEAST ONE CALLER WHO'S IN Q. WHO WASN'T CALLED ON SO I'M ACTUALLY IF YOU USE THAT ARE PART IN THE- MISS CREO- I'M GONNA ASK THE OPERATOR TO GO BACK AND OPEN UP THE PHONE LINE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WAS IN QUEUE. FOR EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR HAD A CHANCE TO GIVE THEIR TESTIMONY OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE PHONE LINES AGAIN. FOR EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR. THANK YOU IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THE TIME. WE WILL CLOSE THE LINE NUMBER TWO SEVEN ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. MY NUMBER TWO SEVEN ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. PLEASE CHECK YOUR MUTE BUTTON. I HAVE NO RESPONSE FROM THAT LINE WE WILL GO TO MY NUMBER TWO SIX ZERO PLEASE GO AHEAD. VENTURE MEMBERS MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF TEST LIVE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION- WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WE STILL BELIEVE THE BILL PUTS CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO OTHER COLLEGE INTO OKAY CHRISTY THANK YOU- THERE ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK MISTER BERMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WANNA THINK THE AUTHOR- AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT OUR TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS IS A JUST TRANSITION THAT CREATES HIGH QUALITY JOBS FOR DISADVANTAGED WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. BY AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE FLEET PURCHASING PART OF THIS BILL BUT I HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT APPLIED TO VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS. I SUPPORT THE REQUIREMENTS THAT MANUFACTURERS COMMIT TO HIRING DISADVANTAGED WORKERS HAVE BEEN DISLOCATED FROM THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY AND PARTICIPATE IN JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS THIS COMMITMENT SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF ADDRESS TRANSIT YEAH I'M A JUST TRANSITION AS- THE AUTHOR HAS HAS. SPOKEN ABOUT HOWEVER THIS BILL CONDITIONS CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FOR MANUFACTURERS ON COMPLIANCE WITH LABOR LAWS IN THE STATE WHERE THE VEHICLE IS MANUFACTURED. I WORRY THAT COMPANIES TO MANUFACTURE IN STATES LIKE ALABAMA WILL HAVE A MUCH LOWER COMPLIANCE BAR TO MEET AND THUS HAVE EASIER ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA STATE FUNDED INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THEN CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING COMPANIES. I DON'T SEE HOW THIS INCENTIVIZES GOOD LABOR PRACTICES GOOD PAYING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA OR HELPS US REACH OUR CLIMATE GOALS- AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. DOES SO AND I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT THIS I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL IN COMMITTEE TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR TO THE AUTHOR AND TO THE SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. THAT OF THE PROVISIONS AROUND MANUFACTURING ARE NOT EITHER TAKEN OUT OR SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED I'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO VOTE NO ON THE FLOOR AND. AND RAISE THE SAME CONCERNS AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU MR MEDINA THANK YOU- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORD AND I JUST WANNA ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALO ALTO AND- BUT I DID HEAR THE AUTHOR SAY IN HER REMARKS THAT SHE IS. GONNA BE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION- WITH THEIR CONCERNS AND AGAIN JUST TO- EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS ALSO ON THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF IMPACTS IT COULD HAVE ON CALIFORNIA A COMPANIES AND URGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK. OF IN IN THAT DIRECTION I WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISSED WHEN DID YOU. I WANTED CAN I ALSO MADAM CHAIR CAN I ASK A QUESTION. YES FOR FUN. RIGHT WELL APPRECIATING- AUTHOR. AND YOUR EFFORT MIGHT I GUESS KIND OF A STATEMENT SLASH QUESTION IS. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS SO AGGRESSIVE THAT MY FEAR IS THAT YOUR- HERE SETTING THESEFLEET PURCHASER OF FAILURE BY MAKING INCENTIVES MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN RATHER THAN EASIER- BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MANDATES YOU HAVE IN HERE IT'S MORE OF LIKE OKAY. THERE'S NO POINT. OF THE SECOND AND THE OTHER PART IS. THIS DOESN'T AFFECT PUBLIC TRANSIT BUSES RIGHT. NOT ONE NOT. THAT'S NOT THE FOCUS OF THE BILL. DOES THIS AFFECT SAY A NONPROFIT. IF THEY'RE PURCHASING SAY BUSES FOR THEIR ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF NON PROFITS IN MY DISTRICT LET THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB EXEDRA THEY ARE THEY HAVE BUSES THAT THE BUS KIDS TO SCHOOL. THEY'RE NOT A- PUBLIC TRANSIT. THEY'RE NOT A PRIVATE- WOULD THEY BE AFFECTED BY THIS. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO RESPOND. THIS IS NOT THE WAY THAT NONPROFIT INCENTIVES WORK ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THAN. WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS WHICH IS ABOUT MATH CLASSIFICATION OF PORT TRUCK DRIVERS AS WELL AS INCENTIVIZING THE MANUFACTURING OF- MORE GREEN TECHNOLOGY- VEHICLES BOTH AND MEDIUM AND HEAVY LIFT TRUCKS- THERE IS THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD IN TERMS OF. WHAT IS THE TRUTH JUST TRANSITION OF WORKERS LOOK LIKE WHICH IS WHAT WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS WITH THIS BILL. NOT QUITE SURE THAT NONPROFIT BUYING OF. OF A BUS FOR THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB NECESSARILY FALLS IN LINE WITH THIS. KIND OF DOES A COMMON MADAM MADAM CHAIR I AM. WE'VE SEEN NOW MORE THAN EVER THAT OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA IS JUST BEEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND I SEE THIS AS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE CONTINUES MANDATE. THAT'S JUST GOING TO BRING ALL THESE MANUFACTURERS AND GIVING THEM AN INCENTIVE TO LEAVE AND SO I. I'M REALLY REALLY CONCERNED THAT JUST THE TRIGGER EFFECTIVE AS ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER WE'RE GONNA START LOSING A LOT OF THAT WE HAVE BEEN ALREADY AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOSE THOUSANDS OF MORE JOBS. BECAUSE OF BILLS LIKE THIS THAT MAKES IT MORE ONEROUS. THAN AN INCENTIVE TO COMPLY SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER WARD. THANK THAT MORE THAN ONE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ON BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I THINK AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED IN YOUR STATEMENT AS WELL IT'S CREATED SOMETHING NEW- AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC IN ANY SOME OF THIS ROOM I WONDER IF YOU COULD BECAUSE THIS IS A NEWISH CONCEPT AND WE TALK ABOUT IT BUT WE REALLY GOTTA SLOW DOWN AND EXPLAIN. WHAT IS A JUST TRANSITION. WELL A JUST TRANSITION- IS REALLY ABOUT ENSURING THAT AS WE- GO FORWARD WITH CALIFORNIA. GOALS THAT WE JUST PASSED SB ONE HUNDRED THAT WOULD MANDATE 1100% RENEWABLE. VEHICLES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF. GOALS TO END FOSSIL FUELS- THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS HERE IN THE STATE- ENDING FRACKING IN THE STATE. BUT ALL OF THOSE JOBS. ALL OF THOSE- INDUSTRIES HAVE JOBS. THE PEOPLE RELY ON. AND SO BEFORE WE BEGIN TO HAVE CONVERSATION OF SHUTTING THINGS DOWN. A REAL CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO TRANSITION. THOSE WORKERS WERE EARNING A- SPECIFIC SALARY. AND WHO ARE ALSO GOOD UNION JOBS. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY BE INCENTIVIZED TO. GO TO A CLEANER- TECHNOLOGY. WILL NOT LOSING THEIR JOB WHILE STILL BEING ABLE TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. HEALTH BENEFITS WITH THEIR UNION TO BE ABLE TO PUT THEIR KIDS THROUGH SCHOOL. THERE IS A HUMAN BEING ATTACHED TO THE JOB THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT JUST TRANSITION ENSURES THAT WE ARE. TALKING ABOUT THE PERSON FIRST. AS WE THINK ABOUT. OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AS WE THINK ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES HOW WE THINK ABOUT ELEVATING. OTHER INDUSTRIES. IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO. BUILD BACK. BETTER AND HAVE FEDERAL STANDARDS AND FEDERAL MANDATES THAT ARE BEING ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE- ACTUALLY GET. TO CLEAN GREEN. ENERGY THESE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAPPEN AND THEY IN MY OPINION CANNOT HAPPEN. WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE WORKERS AND THE PEOPLE. WHO DO THESE JOBS. AND SO THE WHOLE. GOAL HERE IS TO ACTUALLY. MERGE FOR THE FIRST. LAKE AND STANDARDS THAT'S WHAT THANK YOU THAT'S WHY. IT'S A HEAVY LIFT AND IT'LL IT'S A GOOD CONVERSATION TO BE HAVING. IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT IS IT REALLY LOOKED LIKE. AND SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT OR WE CAN ACTUALLY TRY TO DO POLICY THAT HELPS US GET THERE THANK YOU MISS BROWN I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND I WHY I THINK THIS IS SO CREATIVE DESIGN I TRIED TO SIMPLIFY IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT. I ALREADY KNOW THAT IS A AYE CONSUMER AYE YOU SLICE ONCE AND THAT'S THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM SO WE HAVE THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS EXHAUSTED WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD MORE DEMAND FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SO MUCH SO THAT THE AMOUNT THAT WE PUT OUT THERE AND ACTUALLY BEEN- CONSUMED OUT THERE AND SO WHEN WE WHEN WE SEE THIS INTEREST OUT THERE THIS DEMAND FROM CNSUMERS AS DEMAND FROM COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE MOMENT. AND ACTUALLY DO MORE WE'RE IN A POSITION NOW TO BE ABLE TO TIRE POLICIES TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT OTHER KIND OF COAL BENEFITS COULD WE BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE. THROUGH IDEAS LIKE THIS OF THIS CONCEPT THAT WE SEE HERE AND ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY FOUR SMART. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR OTHER AREAS OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE IN MANY OF OUR AREAS OF LEGISLATIVE. ABILITIES AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR TIRING TYING THESE TWO TOGETHER BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THIS. IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TURKEY- ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY OUT THERE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY. INCENTIVIZE THE MARKET PLACE TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER TO MEET HIS EXACTING STANDARDS AND THEN MORE CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WIN BECAUSE OF THIS. FOR THE SAME POTS OF MONEY FOR THE SAME KINDS OF THINGS ARE DOING YES I APPRECIATE YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING AT SOME- OPTIONS FOR AND THEN IS TO TRY TO. MAKE IT MAKE IT WORK SO THAT THIS IMPLEMENTS WELL ON BECAUSE IT REALLY COULD BE TRANSFORMATIVE ON HOW WOULD YOU POLICY I THINK BEYOND. EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR ITSELF SO WITHOUT AND HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR AS WELL AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR ALL THE EFFORT. YOU PUT INTO THIS. THANK YOU MISS. LEE I JUST WANT TO THANK THE ARE DIFFERENT BRING THIS BILL FORWARD AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ONLY CAR MANUFACTURING SITE IN THE STATE AS WELL AS THE ONLY EVEY MANUFACTURING SITE IN THE STATE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAKE SURE IN THOSE WORKING FOR US TO MAKE WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE A GREENER ECONOMY ARE ALSO NOT LEFT BEHIND IN THE BENEFITS OF THE GREEN ECONOMY. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO VERY TO CALARE PUT YOU SAW THE COMMENTS I WAS GONNA SAY BUT YOU KNOW THE MARKET IS THERE THE DEMAND IS THERE ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA WHERE THESE CARS ARE BEING MANUFACTURED- AND I REALLY THINK IT'S REASONABLE STANDARDS THAT YOU'RE SITTING OUT THERE AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE AVOID THE NOT SO PLEASANT HEADLINES ABOUT PEOPLE BEING MISTREATED AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE BEING TREATED WELL AND MAKING SURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE PART OF THAT TALK AS WELL. I KNOW THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN TAKING A LOT OF AMENDMENTS TO CAUGHT TO ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE HAPPENING AND SO I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY RESULTS SO VERY HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTING THIS AND REALLY HAPPY. THAT YOU BROTHERS BEFORE. THANK YOU MS WORKS. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I ALSO- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND PARTICULARLY YOUR ARTICULATION OF THE CONCEPT OF JUST TRANSITION AND YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT WE HAVE REFINERIES THERE. AND THERE IS NO DOUBT WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MOVE OFF OF FOSSIL FUELS AND WE KNOW THIS AND THE SCIENCES THERE AND IS THE MOTHER OF A FOUR YEAR OLD AND NOW NINE MONTHS OLD TODAY NINE MONTHS TODAY. YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THEIR FUTURE AND THE WORLD THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE IN. AND WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE I ALSO KNOW WE HAVE GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS RIGHT THAT ARE- THAT FEW PEOPLE FAMILIES AND THE BALANCE OF THOSE TWO THINGS AND HOW YOU DO THAT. IT IS NOT AN EASY QUESTION TO TACKLE BUT IT'S A CRITICAL ONCE I WHEN IT ACTUALLY THANK YOU FOR THAT I'LL BE SPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I'M GLAD YOU'RE JUMPING ON THIS I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE SPACE OR OTHERS- TO THAT END. I DO HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH ALSO JUST THAT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT- SOME MEMBER BERMAN AND TOUCHED ON I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT IT THIS IDEA THAT- MANUFACTURERS FROM OTHER STATES ALMOST HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THEY WOULD HAVE THE SAME LABOR CENTER COULD YOU JUST ADDRESS THAT- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. SURE WE TOOK A NUMBER OF- OF AMENDMENTS TO HELP. ALSO CLARIFIED THAT TO LET ME JUST MAKE SURE THAT- WE HVE THE LATEST INFORMATION FOR YOU AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS. BECAUSE IT'S TRUE- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE. AT IN THE ASSEMBLY PART OF THE MANUFACTURING IS A BIG PART OF THE QUESTION TOO IF- IF A BUMPER IS MADE IN CHINA AND THEN. BROUGHT TO THE U. S. AND MANY FISH AND PUT AN ASSEMBLED. IN A FACTORY IN DETROIT. IS THAT CONSIDERED AMERICAN MADE. SO THOSE ARE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT DETERMINE SOMETHING TO BE. U. S. MADE OR NOT- THE SAME. AS STANDARD AS APPLYING TO WORDS- DIFFERENT STATES AND WHAT WE AGREED TO. ONE IS THAT THE BIGGEST- COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER STATES HAVE IS ACTUALLY OW WAGES IN RIGHT TO WORK LAWS WHICH ARE VERY DIFFERENT. THAN CALIFORNIA STATE LABOR LAWS. SO THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR EXAMPLE IN ALABAMA AND SEVEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS. FAR BELOW. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS. AB SEVEN NINE FOUR REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO PAY A HUNDRED AND 20% OF THE CALIFORNIA. MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL WORKERS AND THE PREVAILING WAGE FOR PRODUCTION WORKERS. IN AUTO MANUFACTURING TO QUALIFY. SO WE ARE SETTING THE TONE DIFFERENTLY. WE ARE SETTING A DIFFERENT AGENDA. WE ARE SAYING WE WANT TO CREATE JOBS. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE JOBS THE HERE THAT WE ARE EMPLOYING. AMERICAN WORKERS TO DO. WHAT WE ALL WANT TO DO WHICH IS ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AND ENSURE THAT. PRODUCTION MANUFACTURING ASSEMBLING TAKES PLACE HERE. THOSE ARE THE MANDATE TO BUILD BACK BETTER AND CALIFORNIA. IS ALREADY LEADING ON THAT UNTIL. THE YES. IF COMPLICATED BIG. WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT BETTER WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ENSURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE WORK THAT I DO HEAR. THAT WE ARE PROVIDING. MORE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE CREATING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE. IN THE- STATES. IF WE ARE TRULY GOING TO ACHIEVE. THE PILLARS OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL WHICH IS. A JUST TRANSITION. AMOUNT ENJOY. INCOME CHANGE. APPROPRIATE THAT AND- YOU KNOW A THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE WITHIN BERMAN GROUPS AND LABOR GROUPS COMING TOGETHER ON THIS WHICH I THINK IS CRITICAL SO JUST APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. MR DALY THANK YOU I JUST BRIEFLY- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I DO HAVE CONCERNS- ALIGNED WITH THE POINTS MADE BY THE MEMBER FROM PALO ALTO IN THE MEMBER FROM RIVERSIDE- THIS IS VERY VERY AMBITIOUS BILL AND- I'LL BE WATCHING THE AMENDMENTS AS THEY COME FORWARD AND HOPE THAT- EVERYTHING COULD BE ALIGNED AMONG ALL THE VARIOUS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WILL PEOPLE. YES DID YOU EVER HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER WISHING TO SPEAK. WELL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND BRINGING IT BEGINNING THE VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE HAVE A REAL JUST TRANSITION- I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU PARTICULARLY. YOUR SPONSORS FOR BEING SO WILLING TO WORK WITH US AND TO ADDRESS. OUR CONCERNS WHICH WERE MANY AND TO TAKE SO MANY AMENDMENTS IN GOOD FAITH AND TO MAKE THIS REALLY A VERY EASY PROCESS- TO MOVE TO A SUPPORT IMPLEMENTED POSITION ON THE BILL- I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. OF A LENGTH OF ELABORATING ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL- OF COURSE WE WANT THE HIGHEST LABOR STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE CREATE. GREEN INDUSTRY WE ALSO CREATE. EXCELLENT JOBS AND PATH TO PROSPERITY FOR PEOPLE FOR WORKERS AND TO ENCOURAGE MANUFACTURING TO BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE SAME TIME WE DON'T WANT TO HINGED OUR RENEWALS- HOW DO WE MET AND JEOPARDIZING OUR ABILITY TO GET. ELECTRIC TRACKS OUT INTO THE FIELD I WE DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THOSE INCENTIVES IN AND LEAVE I TO WHERE WE DON'T HAVE INCENTIVES FOR WHAT RIGHT NOW IS A VERY RISKY AND EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION- FOR- COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS- SO FINDING THAT RIGHT BALANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE DO HAVE THE INCENTIVES OUT TO MARKET. AND THAT WE HAVE A PATH TO. THIS JUST TRANSITION THAT TRULY. ACHIEVABLE SO HAVING GOOD GOALS. ALL A REALISTIC IN THE HOLDING FOR YOU TO OUR MENU. TO BUT NOT. JEOPARDIZING OUR ABILITY TO- INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO BUY THESE- THESE NEWER VEHICLES IS ALSO IMPORTANT. SO WITH THAT I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT YOU- TOOK AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS- THE WHOLE RANGE OF CONCERNS IT'S JUST TO BUT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW HOW. MUCH WORK WAS DONE ON THIS. YOU TOOK- AMENDMENTS THAT ADDED AN APPEALS PROCESS FOR VIOLATIONS THAT AND A PATHWAY BACK INTO COMPLIANCE FOR ENTITIES THAT FALL OUT OF COMPLIANCE. THAT MODIFIED REPAYMENT PROVISIONS TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN WITH THE PERIOD OF NON COMPLIANCE. AND HAVE HORRIBLE EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DOMESTIC CONTENT REQUIREMENTS NOW. IS GONNA BE MORE WORK ON THIS BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE LANGUAGE. AND I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION IS MOVED. TO OUR HOUSE AND FOR THE SENATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE- IS WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL ALSO BE IN THE SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERS WHO ARE. I THINK REALLY. GOING OUT ON A LIMB TODAY- TO SUPPORT THIS AND REALLY WANT TO SEE IT SUCCEED AS WE ALL DO AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS TO BRING THIS FORWARD. I DID WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE IT AND WE HAVE A SECOND. SO THE- MOTION IS A SUPPORT AS AMENDED. WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE MACCOLL'S. I'M SORRY. SHE HAS TO CLOSE I CAN'T HEAR YOU SHE HAS THE CLOTHES I'M SORRY YES WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH SORRY. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS FOR YOUR VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION TODAY. I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS A NEW SPACE FOR ALL OF US. AS WE TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GET IT DONE IF WE ARE TRULY WORKING TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE. THE GOALS THAT THE STATE HAS AS WELL AS THE GOALS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS- SO I AM OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION I'M OPEN TO CONTINUING TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO MANUFACTURING I WANT CALIFORNIA'S STRONG CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING JOBS. JUST LIKE WHAT I WANT TO SEE THAT ACROSS THE NATION AS WE TRULY TRULY WORK ON A JUST TRANSITION AND- AND THE TRANSPORTATION NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT. AS CONSUMERS WE HAVE MORE OPTIONS FOR EV'S BUT ALSO AS JUST RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT ANY TRUCKS THAT ARE THAT ARE GOING. IN AND OUT OF CALIFORNIA AS WE REALLY ARE THE CRADLE IN WHICH THE REST OF THE NATION RETRIEVED- GOODS AND SERVICES AND THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND IN THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. THAT THOSE WORKERS ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE THE BUYING OF CLEANER. GREENER MORE JUST TRANSITIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE ORIENTED VEHICLES TO ENSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO- AND SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF A LOT OF WORK ON THIS BILL AND I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO. TO WORK ON IT TO GET IT RIGHT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I WILL THINK MANAGER. THINK. YOU'VE MADE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. THE MOTION IS DEEP AS A MAN TO PER. FREE HI FREE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE YOU ARE HERE FOR EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY AND YOU MAY RECEIVE ONE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE BETTER PART OF FOUR YEARS. EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY THE SAFE STREETS ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU I'LL MAKE THIS SHORT I WANT TO OF COURSE THANK THE CHEERING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER DILIGENT WORKING OR DELETE YOUR DEEP COLLABORATION ON THIS BILL WITH MY STAFF AND OUR COALITION. EVERY YEAR I ATTEND A MEMORIAL FOR MY CONSTITUENTS KILLED IN HIGH SPEED COLLISIONS. EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS OVER A THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE DIED IN SPEED RELATED CRASHES. WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE SEVERELY INJURED. AND EVERY YEAR THESE HUMAN TRAGEDIES MAKE LESS AND LESS SENSE BECAUSE THIS IS ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE. THERE'S A TESTED WIDELY USED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN PREVENT THESE INJURIES AND DEATHS. THE TOOL USED EFFECTIVELY BY OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY CITIES AND SIXTEEN STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT SPEED SAFETY SYSTEMS CAN LEAD TO DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS ON SAFE LOCATIONS. REDUCING SPEEDING BY AS MUCH AS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. SERIOUS INJURIES IN FATAL CRASHES BY UP 258% THIS BILL WILLALLOW FIVE CITIES IN THE STATE TO PILOT THIS PROVEN SAFETY TOOL IN SENSITIVE AREAS AROUND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. LIKE SCHOOLS AND SENIOR CENTERS AND ON EACH CITY'S HIGH INJURY NETWORK. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME BUILDING INTO THE LEGISLATION SIGNIFICAN PRIVACY PROTECTIONS EQUITY PROVISIONS FOR LOW INCOME DRIVERS AND DUE PROCESS. TO ADDRESS EQUITY. CITATIONS UNDER THIS PROGRAM WILL BE CIVIL NOT CRIMINAL WILL NOT RESULT IN ANY POINTS ON A DRIVER'S RECORD. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CITATIONS WILL BE CAPPED AT FIFTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF SPEEDING. CITIES WILL NEED TO OFFER DIVERSION PROGRAM AND COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR FOLKS WHO CAN'T PAY. TO ADDRESS PRIVACY THE BILL FORBIDS FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND DRIVER PHOTOS BEING TAKEN BY SYSTEM. DATA CAN BE ACCESSED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR FOR ANY PURPOSE EXCEPT FOR THIS PILOT AND DATA MUST BE DESTROYED BY DATE SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. TO ADDRESS THE PROCESS CITATIONS WILL ONLY BE ISSUED TO DRIVERS TRAVELING AT LEAST ELEVEN MILES ABOVE THE SPEED LIMIT. CITIES MUST CLEARLY SIGN POST SENATORS TO IDENTIFY THE PRESENCE OF A SYSTEM CAN ONLY ISSUE WARNING NOTICES AT THE BEGINNING OF A PILOT. AND HAVE TO PROVIDE AN APPEALS PROCESS. SB SAFETY SYSTEM CAN'T BE OPERATED BEYOND THE FIRST EIGHTEEN MONTHS UNLESS SPECIFIC SPEED REDUCTIONS ARE MET. I WANT TO THANK REPRESENTATIVES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ENGAGE IN DEEP DISCUSSIONS ON AMENDMENTS REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS THAT HAVE BROUGHT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HIGHWAY PATROL. AND PARK TO NEUTRAL. WE'RE ALSO IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE TEAMSTERS AND ARE COMMITTED TO REACHING A POSITIVE RESOLUTION THAT WORKS FOR ALL PARTIES. THIS POLICY IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND IMPROVING THE SAFETY OF SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CONSTITUENTS. ARE CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL. BICYCLISTS HEADING TO WORK SENIORS DOING ERRANDS. WE MUST REMEMBER THOSE WE HAVE LOST BUT ALSO TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT PEOPLE WE KNOW WE CAN SAVE. AB FIVE FIFTY IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. AND WITHOUTTESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY ARGENTI YOU. A FOUNDING MEMBER OF BAY AREA FAMILIES FOR SAFE STREETS AND SELENA RENTALS THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.

WE TRY TO HOLD ON TO THE GOOD MEMORIES EVEN AS HE LASHES OUT AT US. BUT WE CAN CONTROL DELETE A WORST. PRACTICE LIKE THE ONE THAT DESTROYED OUR FAMILY ARE PREVENTABLE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM BY THE LEGISLATION EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO START TO ADDRESS THE DEVASTATING TOLL SPEED. AND TAKING IN OUR CITY. NOT IN TERMS OF ABOUT THE SPEED RELATED DEATHS EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO REALLY INJURED AS WELL. SHE FIFTY SYSTEMS CAN PREVENT SO MANY DEATHS. IN SO MUCH SUFFERING WE NEED A POWERFUL TOOL AND WE NEED IT URGENTLY. I HAVE FOUNDING MEMBER OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA FAMILIES FOR SAFE STREETS A GROUP OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY TRAFFIC CRASHES. AND ASKING TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE MEMBER TO PLEASE SUPPORT EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY. EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY WILL SAVE LIVES AND PREVENT. MORE TRAGEDIES FROM DANGEROUS BEATING. THANK NEXT PLEASE. I CAN'T REMEMBER STILL LEADER CHEN MANAGER OF THE LAST TO OF AND SUPPORT OF AB FIFTY I SPOKE LAST WEEK TO THE ABOUT THE DANGERS SPEEDING AND EFFORT WITH- ONLY SEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC THIS BEARS REPEATING AND SUBSIDIES ARE AFFORDED EVERY TOOL AVAILABLE TO PUT AN END TO THE UNNECESSARY DEATHS CAUSED BY TRAFFIC CRASHES ON OUR STREETS. NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS DYING CRASHES EACH YEAR AND MORE THAN THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT OR SEVERELY INJURED TRAFFICKED UP IN LOS ANGELES ARE UP 55% IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE MANY DUE TO MOTORISTS DRIVING WELL ABOVE THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT THE SERIOUS INJURIES AND DEATHS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG. LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR CHILDREN OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WALKING SPEED KILLS AND IT ROB THEIR COMMUNITIES OF SECURITY AND VITALITY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AIMS TO ELIMINATE TRAFFIC DEATHS WE LEAVE WITH ENGINEERING STREET DESIGN AND EDUCATION BUT ELIMINATING TRAFFIC FATALITIES REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH ENSURING SAFETY ON OUR STREETS MEANS HOLDING RECKLESS DRIVERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA NEED THE MOST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO IMPROVE SAFETY FOR EVERYONE. BY PROVIDING RELIABLE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DRIVING WELL ABOVE THE SPEED LIMIT SPEED SAFETY SYSTEMS ARE PROVEN TO LOWER THE INCIDENCE OF SPEEDING AND REDUCE SEVERE INJURIES AND DEATHS BY UP 258% EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY WOULD ALLOW CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THE PILOT SPEED SAFETY SYSTEMS ON THEIR STREETS TO FURTHER REDUCE SPEEDING AND IMPROVE SAFETY FOR EVERYONE WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND SHARE FRIEDMAN HAVE PUT INTO CRAFTING THIS BILL TO AUTHORIZE PILOTED AND PROTECT PRIVACY. ENSURE EQUITY IN DEPLOYMENT REDUCE THE LEGAL PENALTY OF CITATION AND PROVIDE LOW INCOME PAYMENT ASSISTANCE TO ENSURE THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ABUSED IT ALSO REQUIRES CITIES TO INVEST REVENUE IMPROVING SAFE STREET DESIGNED FOR THEIR RESIDENTS EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY WILL IMPROVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND SAVE LIVES.

A SPECIFIC PROGRAM PROHIBITION AGAINST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ADDING ANY ADDITIONAL FEES ON TO THE STATE IS FINE AMOUNTS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LATE PAYMENT FEES AND HEARING SCREENS A PROHIBITION AGAINST BOOTING TOWING ARE HOLDING THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION RENEWAL FOR NON PAYMENT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT THE BASIC SPEED LAW AND SPEECH TRAP PROTECTIONS APPLY TO CAMERA ISSUE TICKETS SIMILAR TO POLICE ISSUE TICKETS LIMITING THE USE OF CAMERAS TO ENFORCE SPEED LIMITS IN SCHOOL ZONES THE TIMES. AND DISTANCES CURRENTLY IN STATE LAW. WHY MAKE IT WORSE. CAMERAS ARE USED TO FOR SCHOOL SPEED SCHOOL ZONE SPEED LIMITS. THE SPEED LIMIT EXT MILES PER HOUR WHEN FLASHING SIGN BE USED WITHOUT SUCH SIGNAGE MOTORISTS ARE LEFT WONDERING IF AND WHEN THE SCHOOL SPEED LIMIT IS IN EFFECT ARE CAUGHT IN A GOTCHA SITUATION. THAT A WARNING NOTICE BE ISSUED FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION UP TO TWENTY MILES PER HOUR OVER THE SPEED LIMIT. WE FEEL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS NEED TO BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ON A MONTHLY BASIS DATA ON THE NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS CAPTURED AT EACH SPEED IMPROVEMENT NUMBER WARNING NOTICES. AND TICKETS TICKETS ISSUED NUMBER OF REPEAT OFFENDERS AND THE DISPOSITION OF EACH CASE ALL THE NEWS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE AND REPORT THIS DATA WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE DATE WE RECEIVE PROMOTION RESTRICTIONS. USING READ LIKE TAX FURTHER WE BELIEVE ANY EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM'S EFFECTIVENESS BE DONE BY AN INDEPENDENT PARTY NOT THE JURISDICTION RUNNING THE PROGRAM AT THIS AT THIS CONSTITUTES A CONFLICT BEST. INTEREST FINALLY WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF REVENUE GENERATED BY THE PROGRAM STILL PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE FOR CITIES TO RUN THE SYSTEM WITH THE PROFIT MOTIVE.

THE CHEN IS AREA WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FIRST AND FOREMOST I'D LIKE TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR THE pHE'S DEMONSTRATED TO THIS ISSUE AND FOR THE DIFFERENT ITERATIONS THAT HE'S BROUGHT FORWARD IN THE PAST I'VE SUPPORTED THIS WITH THE COPY OUT THAT I MAY NOT WANT TO SUPPORTED MOVING FORWARD- I'VE BASICALLY HAD A VERY CHALLENGING CHALLENGE DIFFICULT TIME. BRINGING MYSELF TO SUPPORT BECAUSE OF- THE TECHNOLOGY BEING UTILIZED AND I'VE SPOKEN TO THE AUTHOR AND HE'S CLARIFIED THAT OBVIOUSLY HE'S HE'S MADE QUITE A BIT OF CHANGES AND ALSO THE AMENDMENTS THAT HE'S TAKEN. MY I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT MY MAIN CHALLENGE IS THAT I FEEL. PROJECTS PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. CREATED DELINEATING LYING BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS- I MYSELF HAVE RECEIVED A TICKET. ALONG THE METRO LINE IN MY DISTRICT- AND I HATED FULLY WELL KNOWING THAT HAD I NOT HATED I WOULDN'T BE HELD TO ACCOUNT. AND IT FRUSTRATES ME TO KNOW THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE SAVVY THE CONNECTIONS THE- MAYBE LEGAL APTITUDE OR OR KNOWLEDGE- OR OR HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO BE INFORMED. THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING IT. CAN CAN GET AWAY- BUT THOSE THAT MAY BE OF LESSER MEANS MORE MODEST MEANS- WILL NOT QUESTION IT AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MAKE EVERY- ATTEMPT TO PAY IT AND BE GOOD IN ACCORDANCE TO LAW SO. BECAUSE OF THAT I JUST HAD A BIT OF A CHALLENGING TIME BUT I SO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND ALL THE CHANGES YOU'VE MADE. THAT HI I'M I'M OF TWO MINDS I'M TRYING TO LISTEN TO THE REST OF THE HEARING AND SEE WHERE I WOULD GO MYSELF BUT I WOULD WANT TO AT LEAST GET TO A PLACE WHERE I CAN GIVE YOU THE THIS AND WHAT I ALSO DO APPRECIATE IS THE FACT THAT IT'S A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. AND SEE HOW THIS WORKS BUT I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT MY FRUSTRATION HAS BEEN WITH HE PREVIOUS PROGRAMS AND HOW pEXTENT. I'M ALMOST VERY MUCH TEMPTED TO INTRODUCE A BILL. DEMANDING THAT. ALL THE- AGENCIES THAT DEPLOYED. CAMERAS IN THE PAST THAT ERRONEOUSLY. ASSESSED FEES ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BUT NOT AND DIDN'T GO AFTER OTHERS. GIVE BACK ALL OF THOSE FEES NOW WITH INTEREST. BECAUSE IT'S SO FRUSTRATING TO SEE THAT WE WOULD DO THAT AND CREATE A VERY- THREE EIGHT DELINEATING LINE BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAVE AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT. SO BUT AGAIN I'M GO VEERING OFF A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH OFF OF THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND I'M GONNA LISTEN AND TRY TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE I CAN SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU MISTER LEE. I WANT TO THANK OUR CALLING CONSENSUS COOPER BRING FOR THIS REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE BEFORE US I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT WE SHOULD BE SOLVING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS WITH INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS AND I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WHAT IT IS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR VERY NEARLY TAILING THIS BILL PUTTING A LOT OF CONDITIONS IN IT AND ULTIMATELY- TRUSTING THAT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING MY CITY CENTRE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS EFFECTIVELY AND KEEP YOUR SEATS STREETS SAFE. AS WE HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE OR THEIR LOVED ONES HAVE HAD FATAL COLLISIONS HAPPENING AND THIS IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE AND I THINK THAT WE'RE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY DEPLOY MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE CAN DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE FATE I TELL OUTCOMES OF SPEEDING AS WELL AS EVERYTHING TOO OFTEN THE FATAL INTERACTIONS OF POLICE DISCRETION AS WELL FROM TRAFFIC INCIDENTS SO I THINK THIS BILL IS GREAT BECAUSE IT DOES TWO THINGS AT ONE TIME. AND HOPE THAT MORE COMMUNITIES- AND MORE CITIES WILL BILL THE BENEFIT THESE PILOT PROGRAMS BUT AGAIN I WANT. TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. ALSO MAKING SURE THAT- THE FINES ARE NOT TO OVER BURDENSOME ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW THAT. I TRUST THIS AUTHOR TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW THE BILL THE GOAL THE BILL. IS TO IS TO HAVE SAFER STREETS NOT TO PENALIZE PEOPLE. SO I REALLY DO HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR CONTINUE WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT BILLS CONTINUE IN THAT SPIRIT. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO VOTE FOR TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA THANK YOU I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTONOMY TRANSMITTANCE HIM- YEAH I KNOW THAT- WE'VE TALKED A LOT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ON THIS BILL I'M NOT GOING TO BE OUT THERE BUT THE CITY IS SAN JOSE WHICH IS A STRONG. PROPONENT OF THE BILL WE HAVE. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES OVER THE YEARS AND FORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK THAT THE STAFF REPORT ANALYSIS OF PROBABLY POINTS OUT THAT- AUTOMATED SPEED ENFORCEMENT CAN ABSOLUTELY HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT IN TERMS OF DISCRIMINATIVE DISCRIMINATORY TRAFFIC STOPS OF BUT THE SAME TIME THE AREAS WHERE THEY GET LOCATED ALSO TEND TO BE HIGHER DENSITY TEND TO BE. THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT ALSO TEND TO GET- MITIGATED MORE- DO BY EITHER WAY AND SO I DO APPRECIATE IS A MOTHER CALLING FROM SAN JOSE POINTED OUT OF ALL THE MEASURES THAT ARE TAKEN TO DEAL WITH ISSUES OF EQUITY BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY WE KNOW. THIS PROGRAM AND FOR FIVE YEARS NOT ALL THE MONEY THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HOPEFULLY THIS WILL LEAD TO TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES ON THOSE CORNERS BECAUSE THAT'S ULTIMATELY THE LONG TERM SOLUTION IS SAFER STREETS AND DOES TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES BUT- I DO BELIEVE THAT IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE MEASURES LIKE THESE. THAT CAN SLOW THE TRAFFIC DOWN AND SAVE LIVES- AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY WE JUST SEE TO HAVE- SAFER STREETS AND SO I APPRECIATE THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THE OTHERS PUT INTO IT. AND I KNOW THAT THE- THE OPPOSITION WE HEARD FROM OUR PART TO PRESERVE THE TEAMSTERS- AND AS THEY INDICATED THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT I'M CONFIDENT THEY'LL BE RESOLUTION OF THOSE ISSUES AS WELL AS A THANK. YOU THANK YOU MISS DAVIS. THANK YOU MR CHIU QUICK. AMERICA TO THE TWO SOUTHERN CAL. SO DUE TO WHICH ONES THOSE ARE. SO WE WANT TO MAKE THAT WE A CITIES NORTHERN. AND SOUTHERN- AND THE CITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO SAN JOSE OAKLAND HAVE WANTED TO DO THIS- DIRECTION MANY OTHER CITIES AROUND THE STATE THEY ARE INTERESTED LOS ANGELES. OBVIOUSLY BEING THE LARGEST CITY IN THE STATE BY A FACTOR OF MANY- WILL BE PART OF IT THE FACILITY IS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED IT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH- WITH THE CHAIR OF WHAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE- I SUSPECT WE WILL WORK THIS OUT- IN THE IN THE COMING COMMITTEES- BUT- HAPPY TO. RECEIVE FEEDBACK ON THAT AND I ALSO WANNA JUST GO THANKED THE LEAGUE OF CITIES FOR SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THIS IS A PILOT. AS NECESSARY TO SAVE LIVES AND- AND OF COME ON BOARD. IT JUST- A COMMENT THAT OF ONE OF THE OF WITNESSES TO PUT OUT THERE I THINK BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE DATA COME YOU KNOW THE- SOONER THAN LATER- JUST TO KEEP TRACK SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE TRANSPARENCY AND REALLY SEE THE RESULTS INSTEAD OF. WAITING TO THE END OF THE STUDY THE PILOT. IN I CAN THERE ARE A LOT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL AND IN FACT ONE. ASPECT OF THE BILL- THAT- I REALLY WANT CREDIT CARD FOR CHAIR FOR PUTTING AND- IS THE BILL. LITERALLY SAYS IF WE DON'T SEE A DEMONSTRABLE DROP. IN THE BEHAVIOR THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE. AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE SYSTEMS COULD BE SHUT DOWN- WE BASICALLY PUT A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS- TO. ENSURE THAT WERE EITHER GOING TO SEE QUICK ACTION AND QUICK RESULTS. FOR THE SYSTEMS WILL BE SHUT DOWN. SO I THINK HOPEFULLY THAT WILL AGAIN CONTINUE TO BUILD- CONFIDENCE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE SO I WILL GIVE MY COMMENTS I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU. MISTER CHIU FOR. WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS- IT'S- AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I FEEL LKE NOW BECAUSE OF THE RIVER GROWING REALIZATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING- INTERACTIONS AND A LOT OF COMMUNITIES BETWEEN LAW. LAW OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC. BECAUSE OF IMPLICIT BIAS AND KNOWING THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE GET STOPPED MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO BUILD- AUTOMATION AND- FOR FAIRNESS AND EQUITY REASONS- I WANT TO ALSO THANK MR CHIU FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND WORKING WITH US SO CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BILL. THAT WE COULD BRING FORWARD TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD IN THE PAST WHICH ARE ALL VERY LEGITIMATE- A FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT ABOUT THE BILL- BESIDES. THE FACT THAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE CLEARLY ABOUT REDUCING SPEEDS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SPEED. REALLY IS THE DETERMINING FACTOR BETWEEN SURVIVING. A COLLISION OR NOT SURVIVING A COLLISION MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THAT THIS BILL DOES REQUIRE. WARNINGS BEFORE YOU ENTER A SPEED CAMERAS OWN. NOT OUT OF FAIRNESS BUT ACTUALLY TO REDUCE THE SPEED THE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING BECAUSE WE THINK OF WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE IS GET PEOPLE TO SLOW DOWN. SO WE THINK THAT HAVING THAT MORNING IN AND OF ITSELF AND GET PEOPLE TO SLOW DOWN. AND AS HE MENTIONED IF IT DOESN'T THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE SYSTEM ANYMORE. IT ALSO SAYS THAT IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE RESULTS THEY WANT THEY HAVE TO INVEST IN TRAFFIC COMING IN ORDER TO USE THE SYSTEM TO REALLY ENCOURAGE CITIES. TO LOOK AT THIS HOLISTICALLY TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS THEY NEED IN THE ENGINEERING TO MAKE THE ROADS SAFER. AND THEN SO THAT WE ADDRESS THE CONCERN ABOUT SPEED TRAPS. THE MONEY THAT'S GENERATED CAN'T GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND OF THE CITY IT GOES RIGHT BACK INTO THOSE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HAVING THE TICKETS. TO DO THOSE KINDS OF ROAD IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE THOSE COMMUNITIES SAFER. IN ADDITION I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEED YOU WANT TO GET A TICKET FROM A SPEED CAMERA BECAUSE THESE FINES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD GET. FROM A POLICE OFFICER AND IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME WE ALSO BUILD IN. A A REDUCED- FEET FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS SO. THE BILL CENTERS FAIRNESS IT CENTERS EQUITY AND IT REALLY HASN'T I TOWARDS THE GOAL OF REDUCING SPEEDS AND THAT'S BUILT IN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE BILL. I WANT TO I THINK THEAUTHOR THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER ALSO WANT TO THANK LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ACT. AND A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROLMAN FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH THE OFFER AT AUTHOR AND MOVING THEIR OPPOSITION. TAKING THAT MAKING SURE THIS BILL IS THE BEST BILL COULD BE AND TAKING THAT LEAP OF FAITH TO LET THIS PILOT PLAY OUT TO THE WE CAN ALSO BE DATA. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK TO BE ADDED AS A JOINT AUTHORS. OF THIS BILL IF YOU WOULD. BE WILLINGTO HAVE ME- I WOULD- CERTAINLY SUPPORTS THIS TODAY AND THE- MOTION IS. TO SUPPORT WITH THE AMENDMENTS- DOES ANYBODY HAVE I FIRST I'D LIKE TO LET THE AUTHOR- CLOSE IF YOU WOULD LIKE. ANY CONCERNS YOU HEARD I WAS GOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS- BUT. YOU'LL REALLY APPRECIATE I THINK YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF THE AT. YOU KNOW I TO ADDRESS OUR CALL FROM AUSTIN. AND SOME OF HIS. IN SAY THE FOR. WHICH IS. RED LIGHT CAMERA PROGRAMS ADMITTEDLY HAD A CHECKERED HISTORY IN OUR STATE THERE ARE MANY MANY MANY CHALLENGES WITH THEM. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS IS DIFFERENT- AN AUTOMATED SPEED ENFORCEMENT NOT ONLY. LITERALLY OPERATES DIFFERENTLY. BUT WE HAVE. LEARNED ALL OF THE MISTAKES. AND LESSONS FROM THE PAST TO BUILD AND AS THE CHAIR SAID FOR EXAMPLE ISSUES OF EQUITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RATHER THAN- A CRIMINAL PENALTY OR A POINT ON SOMEONE'S RECORD THAT IMPACTS THAT INSURANCE THAT COST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- MANY FINES IN THE FIFTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY CAPT- WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO THINK THROUGH EQUITY. THIS IS NOT ABOUT GOTCHA MOMENTS SO THE BILL REQUIRES. IF YOU'RE DRIVING IN A ZONE YOU WILL SEE SIGNAGE THAT SAYS THERE IS A SPEED SAFETY. SYSTEM HERE- WE ARE REQUIRING JURISDICTIONS TO EDUCATE. NEIGHBORHOODS SO THAT FOLKS KNOW WITH. WITH PLENTY OF TIME- THAT THERE IS A SPEED SAFETY SYSTEM- ON TOP OF THAT- WE- IF THIS IS ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL OUR HOPE IS THE SYSTEMS ARE MAKING MONEY. BECAUSE THE IDEA IS PEOPLE STOP SPEEDING. UP AND THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL AND TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT REVENUE- WE HAVE BAKED INTO THIS BILL. AFTER A STRONG SUGGESTION OF THE CHAIR A REQUIREMENT THAT ANY REVENUES HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES FOR. STREET IMPROVEMENTS- AND THEN AFTER A COUPLE YEARS THOSE REVENUES WOULD HAVE TO GO TO ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. BUT AGAIN IF THERE'S NO DOCUMENTED SUCCESS. THESE PROGRAMS WILL SHUT DOWN AND THIS IS AGAIN A PILOT FOR FIVE CITIES THAT DESPERATELY WANT- LET ME JUST CLOSE BY THANKING. THE COALITION REPRESENTING PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES REPRESENTING LAW ENFORCEMENT. REPRESENTING TRANSIT PEDESTRIAN BIKE SAFETY ADVOCATES REPRESENTING SENIORS. AS I SAID BEFORE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES BUT IN PARTICULAR. LOS ANGELES OAKLAND SAN FRACISCO AND SAN JOSE. AND THEN OF COURSE I WANT TO JUST AND BIKING OLOGY- THE TREMENDOUS ADVOCACY. BORN OUT OF TRAGEDY OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES. DUE TO THIS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT IT WITH AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TRY AND THAT'S MY ASK OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT WE ALLOW THESE FIVE CITIES TO PILOT THIS LET'S SEE IF IT WORKS. WE CAN IMPROVE IT IF WE NEED TO- BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU WE'VE SPENT YEARS. DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PILOT WILL HOPEFULLY BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE. AND WITH THAT ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

NEXUS NUMBER THREE TWENTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. SAN FRANCISCO- WHAT THE BILL. AND AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MANAGER THANK YOU OPERATOR WE'LL TAKE IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISS DAVIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I GUESS I GUESS MY QUESTION HERE IS ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS- WE JUST LOST SOMEONE. J. WATKINS BEEN AFFECTED FORTY YEAR OLD GENTLEMAN AND THEY GET HIT BY A CAR BUT TO BLOCK MY HOUSE WE'VE ALSO IN THE LAST YEAR. LOSS ANOTHER CHILD THAT J. WALKED IN. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS AN ADULT WE CAN MAKE PRETTY GOOD JUDGMENTS. BUT IS THERE AN AGE ON THIS BECAUSE AN EIGHT YEAR OLD OR A- YEAR OLDS. FIRST CHILDREN THAT ARE WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE DOING THIS BY EXAMPLE THINKING WELL IF THEY CAN DO WHAT I CAN DO IT I JUST. THAT'S MY CONCERN IS YOU KNOW. IN THE DOOR THE POLICE ARE GONNA KNOW HOW OLD ARE YOU I UNDERSTAND THE FINE PART. I'M JUST REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO JUST YOU KNOW IF IT'S RED LIGHT BUT I THINK I CAN WALK AND I DON'T SEE ANYBODY I CAN GO AHEAD AND CROSS OVER. THAT'S MY CONCERN WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY IN LIFE IT ESPECIALLY WE JUST. GO AHEAD AND PASS THE BILL WITH THE PILOT PROGRAM BECAUSE OF SPEEDING AND THAT'S A CONCERN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW SO. IF YOU COULD JUST- MAYBE CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR SIDE TO THAT IT'S REALLY THE H. A LOT THAT'S REALLY HITTING ME THANK YOU. NOT FOR YOUR QUESTION. I DON'T BELIEVE WE SET AN AGE LIMIT. IN THIS BUT- AS AS A PARENT IF YOUR CHILD IS A CERTAIN AGE I WOULD HOPE THEY WOULD BE WALKING WITH THEIR PARENTS. I THINK THERE ARE DAYS WHERE THEY CAN'T MAKE THOSE JUDGMENTS BUT I I'M HAPPY TO TALK TO MY STAFF AND SEE. IF THERE IS AN AGE LIMIT ON THE BILL. WHY SEE ANY. ELSE WHICH IS- I WANT TO THANK YOU BRING THIS. I THINK THE- IS A VERY GOOD BILL. AND JUST TO ANSWER. MYSTIQUE IS VERY REASONABLE CONCERN I THINK THAT THAT IS A BIG CONCERN. MY CHILD. IS GOING TO NOT. J. WALK WHEN IT'S DANGEROUS. NOT BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF FORGETTING A TICKET BECAUSE IS VERY RARELY A POLICE OFFICER AROUND. SHE'S GOING TO LEARN NOT TO J. WALK WHEN IT'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE I WILL EXPLAIN TO HER THE DANGER. OF WALKING IN TRAFFIC- THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE SAFER I DON'T THINK ANY THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHERE PEOPLE. STOP AND LOOK AROUND AND CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING DANGEROUS JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NO LAW ENFORCEMENT. IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO THAT ARE DANGERS THAT WE DON'T CRIMINALIZE- I DON'T. WANT TO TELL MY DAUGHTER NOT TO JUMP OUT OF A SECOND FLOOR WINDOW BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET ARRESTED. I TRY TO EXPLAIN THE DANGERS FOR HER AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TREAT. J. WALKING IN THE SAME WAY AND ADDITIONALLY. IN MANY PLACES WE HAVE REALLY MADE WALKING VERY INCONVENIENT AND UNPLEASANT. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WALK REALLY FAR SOMETIMES TO GET TO WITH THE LEGAL CROSSWALK. AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE CITIES TO LOOK AT THE WEIGHTED ENGINEER THEIR STREETS TO MAKE THE MORE PLEASANT. AND LASTLY I'LL JUST SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO WALKS AROUND. SACRAMENTO A LOT MYSELF AT NIGHT. THERE ARE TIMES WHERE I DON'T FEEL SAFE TO NINETY ONE. SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE REASONS WHY WE SHOULD GIVE PEOPLE. THE ABILITY TO USE THEIR OWN COMMONSENSE- WHEN THEY CROSS THE STREET. RATHER THE AND MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER IN TERMS OF THE WAY TO DESIGN. AND NOT THINK THAT SOMEBODY WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO GET A TICKET IS GOING TO BE THE PRIME MOTIVATOR AS TO WHETHER THEY ACT. SAFELY OR DANGEROUSLY SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD BILL I THINK THAT. REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF TICKETS THAT PEOPLE ARE GIVEN FINES AND SOMETIMES VERY UNFAIRLY USING A LOT OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN A LOT OF BULLYING BEHAVIOR. IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO STOP AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS A GOOD STEP TO DO THAT. SO I DID WE HAVE A MOTION I FEEL LIKE I HEARD ABOUT EIGHT DIFFERENT MOTIONS ABOUT EIGHT DIFFERENT SETTINGS SO. YOU CAN PICK WHOEVER YOU SAW FIRST. AS A MOTION AND A SECOND. AND THE- MOTION IS TO DO A TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST- RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO FOR CREATIONS FRIEDMAN. HI. FRIEDMAN I FONG. FONG I BERMAN. BERMAN HI CAN. CUNNINGHAM ON DALY DAILY I DAVIES.

OKAY. TWO TWELVE TO GO TO THE BILL'S OUT LIBERAL OPEN THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE EDU THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE MISTER WOULD WITH AB FORTY ONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND GOD BLESS YOU ALL THANK YOU. THIS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE OF THE MYRIAD WAYS IN WHICH THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF THROUGHOUT THERE ARE STATE THIS PAST YEAR. THE SOLUTION I PUT FORWARD PUT PUT FORTH IN AB FORTY ONE ARE NOT SILVER BULLETS THEY ARE IMPORTANT STEPS AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO BRING CALIFORNIA'S DATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SINCE TAKING OFFICE COMMONSENSE EXPANSION OF RURAL BROADBAND ACCESS HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF MINE. THE CONCEPT OF DIG ONCE IS NOT A NEW POLICY AREA FOR ME. WELL I AM FRUSTRATED THE LACK OF PROGRESS SINCE I FIRST RAISED THE ISSUE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I'M HEARTENED BY A COMMITMENT FROM CALTRANS TO MAKE THIS RIGHT. MY OFFICE IS TO WAY FOR SPECIFICS WHAT WE BELIEVE THERE IS- THERE HAS ONLY BEEN A SINGLE INSTANCE OF DIG ONCE UTILIZED SINCE I STARTEDWORKING ON THAT. THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT IN ALL OF OUR ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT- BRUCKMAN'S PASSING THROUGH ALL OF OUR UNDERSERVED CONSTITUENCIES THAT THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE OPPORTUNITY IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. TO DIG ONCE. WE CANNOT FACILITATE SIMPLE EFFICIENCIES IT DRASTICALLY SAVE ON BUILDING COSTS WHEN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WILL CONTINUE TO WROTE. QUOTE EQUITY THE DIGITAL TO THE DIGITAL I WILL CONTINUE TO ROADS. EQUITY IN OUR STATE PUT SIMPLY AS WE UPGRADE OUR STATE ROADWAYS WE NEED TO DETERMINE HOW. NOT IF BROADBAND IS A PART OF THAT IMMINENT- INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER TIME DELAY CON DO IT THEN WHEN WE HAVE THE GROUND OPEN UP ALREADY. WE'RE GOING TO INVESTING CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO ASK A LITTLE MORE OF OUR PARTNERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. PRINT PART FRANKLY I THINK WE'VE INCREASED TREND WITH WE NEED INCREASED TRANSFER PARENTS SEE NOW BROADBAND IS ROLLED OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WILL BE SURE THAT EVERY HOUSEHOLD IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL CUSTOMER WHEN WE BUILD OUT INFRASTRUCTURE. NEEDED TO BETTER THEIR INSTANCES IN MY DISTRICT WHERE BUSINESSES OR INDIVIDUALS TO PAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. TO BRING BROADBAND SERVICE TO THEIR PARCEL. OPPOSITION FROM OF. SIX THAT COMMUNITIES SHOULD JUST USE THE LINE EXTENSION PROGRAM. I KNOW THIS IS A TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. BUT THIS LINE EXTENSION PROGRAM- ISN'T WORKING QUITE IS IT WORKING WELL. I FEAR THIS SENT TO ME IS BEING PASSED THROUGH NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PROFITABLE BECAUSE THEY AREN'T PROFITABLE ENOUGH RIGHT NOW WE'RE LETTING CURRENT INCOME IT'S CARVE UP OUR RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE SAME FRENZY. AS A SOTHEBY'S ART AUCTION HIS BITTERS NGUYEN AND YOU HAVE TO BE FABULOUSLY WEALTHY TO GET IN THE DOOR. WE EVEN HOPE THAT NARROW EXTENSIONS WOULD HAVE CONNECTED OTHERS ALONG THE WAY FOR MORE INDIVIDUALS NEAR THE DESTINATION BUT THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. BRITAIN DESIRE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AHEAD OF THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY. ONE ENTITY PAIN STAGGERING SUMS IS NOT WHAT WE WHAT THE MARKET DICTATES IT'S BROADBAND GERRYMANDERING. ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CHOICE STERLING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S RECORD OF WORK OFFICE. I LOOK FORWARD TO A SOLUTION THAT SERIOUSLY CONSIDERS EACH A POTENTIAL CUSTOMER FOR THIS VITAL RESOURCE EVERY TIME A SHOVEL BREAKS GROUND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBM. THANK YOU OPERATOR CAN WE PLEASE HAVE CHOI STERLING. SB THIRTY FORTY ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR WHAT IT MEANS TO DELIVER BROADBAND TO OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. THE HIGHWAYS THAT BISECTED STATE MIGHT SEE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS ONLY ONCE IN MY LIFETIME. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS ANY OPPORTUNITY TO INSTALL HIGH SPEED FIBER OPTIC CABLE. AS YOU NO BIG ONE DRASTICALLY SAVE ON COSTS. IDENTIFYING STANDARDS FOR OUR STATE ROADWAYS IS MERELY A PRACTICALITY. LET ME ASSURE YOU THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS A PUBLIC POLICY PRIORITY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HEALTHCARE EDUCATION AGRICULTURE AND TRANSPORTATION. NAMELY OPERATIONS MAINTENANCE ROAD SAFETY TRAFFIC FLOW THE ADVENT OF THE THOMAS CARS AND TRUCKS. DR WOODS BILL IS A KEY PART OF THE PRACTICAL PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION STAGE OF BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE MOVING FORWARD TO ACTUALLY BUILDING OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER BILLS MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WILL HELP THE STATE WORK WITH NEW FEDERAL INVESTMENT AND EXPAND ELIGIBILITY FOR FUNDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBES AND NONPROFIT. PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR ARE KEY TO COST EFFECTIVELY MEETING OUR IMMEDIATE AND FUTURE BROADBAND NEEDS. BIG ONE IS THE LOW HANGING FRUIT. I HOPE YOU WILL ALSO HEAR DOCTOR WOULD APPEAL. FOR INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURES IN INTERNET SERVICE AREAS. ONLY WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THE GAPS CAN WE PROPERLY SERVE OUR CONSTITUENCY. AB FORTY ONE IS A NECESSARY STEP IN GIVING OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES THE MEANS. TO ACTUALLY FINALLY GET ON THE- THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. TWO IT IS IN UP. THE FIRST IS HERE IN THE ROOM OR CLOSE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FOR OROZCO WITH CAL CABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION- FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING DILIGENTLY ON THIS BILL WE HAD SOME GREAT MEETINGS TO DISCUSS OUR OPPOSITION. AND I THINK RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN SOME AMENDMENTS TO IMPROVE THE PORTION DEALING WITH THE- CONDUIT INSTALLATION- IT'S NOW TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL WHICH IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ISSUE SO THAT WAS ADDRESSED IN THE LATEST MOMENT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. AND THEN ALSO IN IDENTIFYING THE APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS WHERE CON DO IT SHOULD BE INSTALLED- PREVIOUSLY AND HAVE BEEN SOME LANGUAGE ADDRESSING- THE A PREVIOUS REPORT FROM THE PC THERE WAS OUTDATED. BUT WITH THE AMENDMENTS IS NOW THE BROADBAND COUNCIL I STILL THINK THAT MANY SOME WORK THERE I'VE DISCUSSES WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS I THINK PROBABLY TO MAKE THAT THE EASIEST APPROACH IT SHOULD BE JUST AREAS IDENTIFIED. THAT HAVE LESS THAN- PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF TWENTY FIVE AND THREE I THINK THAT OULD MAKE IT THE MOST SIMPLISTIC AND WE COULD WORK WITH THE CALTRANS AND IDENTIFYING THOSE AREAS. SO THIS SEASON MY MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN IT HOWEVER WE ARE STILL OPPOSED BECAUSE OF THE TRANSPARENCY OF RELEASING CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY INFORMATION NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS COMMITTEE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT ISSUE. BUT THANK THE. COMMITTEE FOR THE IMPROVEMENTS THE BILL. HILL US POST THE MEASURE THAT OVERALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN WE HAVE STEVE CARLSON ON THE PHONE. OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE BY MISTER CARLSON. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON- CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS OUNSEL FOR CPA WHERE THE TRADE ASSOCIATION. FOR THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE OPPOSED TO AB FORTY ONE. CTIA THAT'S MEMBERS FULLY SUPPORT IT COLLABORATED WITH POLYMET POLICY MAKERS AND REGULATORS TO ENHANCE BROADBAND ACCESS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND AGREE- COMPLETELY ON THE NEED FOR BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. AS SUCH OUR OBJECTIONS ARE NOT TO THE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE DIG ONE SECTION TO THE BILL. AND WE SUPPORT EXPLORING COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO USE CONDUIT INSTALLED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. BUT INDICATED BY MISTER ROSCOE- THE AMENDMENT- HAVE BEEN ARE- BENEFICIAL AND ARE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS TO FURTHER CLARIFY ASPECTS OF THAT SECTION. REGRETTABLY WE MUST OPPOSE SECTION ONE IN ITS ENTIRETY THAT REQUIRES COMPETITIVE COMPANIES TO BROADCAST THE BILL THAT PLANS. PUBLISHING COMPANY TO PUBLICIZE THE COMPANY DEPLOYMENT PLANS TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD DOES NOT ADVANCE THE BILL OR DO YOU WANT. INSTEAD IT FORCES COMPANIES TO REPORT AND COMMUNICATE BUSINESS PLAN- TO PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING PRICING INFORMATION ALSO TO COMPETITORS WHICH COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE AND I TRUST IMPLICATIONS. ALSO PUBLIC FUNDING ON THE PATIENT PUBLICIZING THE LOCATION OF FACILITIES JEOPARDIZES THE SECURITY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO CONNECT NETWORK VULNERABLE TO ACT OF VANDALISM THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND NATIONAL SECURITY IMPACTS. WE AGREED TO PROVE BABSON IMPROVED BABSON NEEDED ON THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION WITHIN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING THOSE RULES BUT UNFORTUNATELY UNTIL THAT ISSUE IS THE IS THE DRESSED WE MUST RESPECTIVELY OPPOSE. AB FORTY ONE IN ASKING ABOUT. THANK YOU MUCH. THE OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE FIRST OF ALL THERE TO ANYONE ELSE IN THE CHAMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK TO ANYONE IN THE WITNESS ROOM. K.

AND AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MANSION. OKAY WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS AMONG'S COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE ONE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR- CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT TO THE DIG ONCE POLICY AND I AM SUPPORT OF THAT MAYBE YOU COULD ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF. OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE SECURITY SIDE OF IT- ON SECTION ONE. WELL I CAN YOU. CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO NOT HAPPEN I'M ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE KNOW WHERE. WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS- AND IT DOESN'T NEED TO MEAN MEAN TO. THAT WE NEED TO THE WORLD TO KNOW WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUT BUT INTERESTED PARTIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SO. HAD THAT HAPPEN MAYBE- MAYBE CALTRANS WOULDN'T HAVE- DESTROYED A FIBER OPTIC LINE IN MY DISTRICT AND THAT THE WHOLE NORTH COAST OUT OF INTERNET ACCESS IF YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO- YOU KNOW SO. I GUESS IF YOU WOULD EVER CONCERNED ABOUT SECURITY ISSUES OF PEOPLE KNOW WHERE OUR WATER SUPPLIES ARE THEY KNOW WE'RE ELECTRIC SUPPLIES ARE- THESE ARE BURIED FOR THE MOST PART AND- AND THOSE THAT AREN'T. RUNNING ON LINES AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE THAT THERE ARE SECURITY CONCERNS BUT THEY'RE SIX SECURITY CONCERNS ABOUT ALL OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO WORK AROUND THAT AND WE CONTINUE. TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. OKAY THE SURVEY DANCER- SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE- I DO MOTION SECOND.
