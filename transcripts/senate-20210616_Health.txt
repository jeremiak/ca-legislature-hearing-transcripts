SO THE COROLLA SEVEN TWO WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL ALL RIGHT LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO- ITEM NUMBER TWO EIGHTY THIRTEEN FORTY FAR AGAIN BY SUMMER RAIN DELAY- PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU DR CANNON SENATORS SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS S. EAT PEAS HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL IN REDUCING HIV HEPATITIS C. AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN CALIFORNIA. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL PROTECT THESE VITAL SERVICES BY PROVIDING THESE PROGRAMS WITH AN EXEMPTION TO SEE CORE REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A RISE IN DRUG RELATED HARMS INCLUDING OVERDOSE DEATHS HEPATITIS C. DIAGNOSIS RATES AND INCREASED RATES OF POTENTIAL HIV TRANSMISSION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCESS TO STERILE SYRINGES REDUCES HIV AND VIRAL HEPATITIS INFECTIONS WHILE BEING SAFE EFFECTIVE AND COST SAVINGS. CALIFORNIA S. C. PEAS PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES IN ADDITION TO SYRINGE ACCESS AND DISPOSAL INCLUDING HIV AND HEPATITIS TESTING. OVERDOSE PREVENTION TRAINING AND REFERRALS TO DRUG TREATMENT HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THESE SERVICES HAVE HELPED GARNERED THE TRUST IN PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE SEEK OUT HARM REDUCTION SERVICES. BUT RECENTLY UNEXPECTED LEGAL CHALLENGES HAVE ARISEN DESPITE THE CLEAR LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE THAT THIS SECTION IS TO OPERATE NOTWITHSTANDING. ANY OTHER LAW. ON IN ORDER COUNTY HAS INTERPRETED AS HE PEES AS PROJECTS SUBJECT TO THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT BECAUSE THE PROGRAM COULD NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT I COLLECTED ALL THE SYRINGES DISTRIBUTED. SUBSEQUENTLY THE PROGRAM WAS FORCED TO SHUT DOWN. ANOTHER PROGRAM IN BUTTE COUNTY HAS BEEN FORCED TO RESEND THE CDPH APPROVED APPLICATION IN THE FACE OF SIMILAR LITIGATION. ADDITIONALLY A SIMILAR LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST AN S. E. P. AND SANTA CRUZ IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE MUST BE REMINDED THAT THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EXPAND AS HE PEES IN OUR STATE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUR LOOMING OPIOID PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE'S BEEN A SHARP INCREASE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AS EVIDENCED BY THE CDC. THE NEED FOR ACCESS TO SERVICES PROVIDED BY NCP'S IS NOW GREATER THAN EVER. THESE TYPES OF SUITS ARE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW REQUIRING SEQUEL REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS IMPROPERLY PLACES DISEASE PREVENTION ND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AT ODDS. WITHOUT IMMEDIATE LEGISLATIVE ACTION THE PUBLIC HEALTH PREVENTION SERVICES PROVIDED BY C. S. C. P.'S DIRECTLY AUTHORIZED BY CITY PH WILL BE CURTAILED AND NEW PROGRAMS WILL BE DETERRED AT THE PERSON HI THE PRECISE TIME. WHEN THE NEED FOR THEM IS INCREASING. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL HELP PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM THE RAPID SPREAD OF HIV HEPATITIS OR ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY DEADLY OR DISABLING INFECTIONS THAT ARE SPREAD THROUGH THE SHARING OF USED NEEDLES AND SYRINGES BY PROTECTING THESE VALUABLE COMMUNITY BASED S. C. PEAS. I AM JOINED TODAY BY WITNESS MARICELA SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE.

TRANSMISSION AND ENGAGE WITH REGARDS TO THE TREATMENT AND REDUCE THE OVERALL DRUG USE. DURING SERVICES PROGRAMMES DID MORE THAN JUST PROVIDE SYRINGES IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DISTRIBUTE THE OPIOID ANTIDOTE NALOXONE TO PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS AND THEY PROVIDE LNKAGE TO DRUG TREATMENT AND SOMETIMES SERVICES ON SITE ENTERING CODED EVERLIGHT KOBE TESTING VACCINATION.

DR ANGELA SAID THIS HAS LED TO OTHER PROGRAMS CLOSING IN CHICO AND NOW ONE CAN ACCRUE THOSE UNDER LEGAL THREAT ONE OF THE MAIN COMPLAINT OF THOSE OPPOSING PROGRAM IS THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS CONTRIBUTE CHOOSE YOUR FRIENDS LATER WITH IMPORTANT NOW THAT WE NEED TO WAIT IS NOT.

YOUR CHAIRMAN MADAM VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS FILLED MY NAME'S TODD HIMANSHU WHO CARRY SUPERVISOR VIEW COUNTY. YOU CAN ONLY POSES A TEMPLATE BILL THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO EXEMPT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORIZATION A SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS FROM SECRET PROCESS. ONE OF THE MOST SOLEMN OBLIGATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS AT EVERY LEVEL IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND TO ENSURE THE ENVIRONMENT REMAINS PRISTINE AND LITTER FREE AS POSSIBLE BOTH FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. NEEDLE LITTER IS AN UNAVOIDABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE LOOSELY REGULATED DRUG PARAPHERNALIA DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH HAVE NO REQUIREMENT TO EXCHANGE USED NEEDLES FOR CLEAN ONES. WHILE C. E. P. H. SIX TO EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM THE CONSEQUENCES THE DANGER TO THE PUBLIC REMAINS. FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN MUST NOW WORRY ABOUT THE DANGER OF POTENTIAL NEEDLE STICKS WHEN VISITING PLAYGROUNDS PARKS AND WATERWAYS. THE IMPACT THE SUPPER ARE JUST AS REAL AS HIV AND HEPATITIS THE- DO YOU COUNTY AND THE CITY OF CHICO IN PARTICULAR HAVE EXPERIENCE NEEDLES BEING DISCARDED IN MANY OF THESE AREAS IF THIS IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD I'M NOT SURE WHAT IS. YOU COUNTY AND ALL FIVE INCORPORATED CITIES IN BUTTE COUNTY. ORDINANCES TO BAN ANY NEEDLE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AND TELL. IF THE RULING PARTY MENTAL REVIEW CAN BE COMPLETED. BUTTE COUNTY STRONGLY ENCOURAGES THIS COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT SEEK WHAT. THE SEQUEL PROCESS IT'S PART OF BEING EVEN LEGAL OR DRUG.

AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN OUR QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU LET'S NOW BRING IT BACK TO ME- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL- NEEDLE- EXCHANGING THE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS- OR LIFESAVING- DAILY- REDUCE. HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTIONS THERE'S REALLY NO LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT AGAINST THE EFFICACY OF THESE PROGRAMS- NEEDLE EXCHANGE- ORIGINATED IN SAN FRANCISCO DURING THE WORST OF THE AIDS. CRISIS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES NINETEN NINETIES WHEN IT WAS COMPLETELY ILLEGAL AND THE CITY FINALLY WAS. ABLE TO GET AUTHORIZATION FROM THE STATE BUT- YOU KNOW THIS IS- THERE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION BY EVEN SOME CONSERVATIVE ARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE RESISTED IT HAVEENDED UP IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS WHEN HIV EVEN RUNS OUT OF CONTROL- AMONG IV DRUG USER POPULATIONS- AND SO UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH WE SEE- CONTINUING PUSH BACK FROM SOME IN THE COMMUNITY- AND I THINK SOMETIMES THERE'S THIS FALSE PERCEPTION THAT. HAVING A NEEDLE EXCHANGE ANY OF THIS TO BE SOME PROGRAM IS SOMEHOW GOING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO START INJECTING. DRUGS WHICH IS COMPLETELY FALSE THEY'RE ALREADY INJECTING DRUGS AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO DROP THOSE DEALS IN THE GROUND THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT WHETHER OR NOT- A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM. EXISTS THE IDEA THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE FUELING A SYRINGE LETTER. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT FRUSTRATES SAN FRANCISCANS AS MUCH AS A FRUSTRATED ANYONE NO ONE WANTS TO SEE NEEDLES ON THE GROUND BUT- THAT THAT IS NOT CONNECTED TO WHETHER THERE'S A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE EITHER GOING TO DO IT OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT- AND HONESTLY LIKE THE IDEA OF. TAKING SO SEQUEL- IS- THE IDEA THIS WOULD EVER BE IN SEQUENCE TO BEGIN WITH IS. FRANKLY AN INDICTMENT OF. LET'S SEE WHAT THIS IS NOT A SECRET ISSUE WHY C. C. WHO WAS AN ACTOR TO- TO MAKE SURE WE'RE EVALUATING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT. IT IS. A STRETCH AT PAST THE SUIT THIS IS A LEGITIMATE- SYKORA SITUATION AND SO. CLARIFYING THIS IS ACCEPTANCE EQUAL I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA SO I MOVED. THANK YOU FOR THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SERRA WINNER CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER ED TERRIBLE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. SO TO THE CHAIR- IS THERE ANY ANY STUDY JUST BASED ON WHAT THE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO SAID. ANY STUDY ON THE IMPACTS OF- NEEDLES BEING. THROWN TO THE GROUND IT IT I GUESS THE REASON WHY I'M ASKING IS I KNOW EACH ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS IS DIFFERENT. AND JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO JUST SAID THAT SAN FRANCISCANS ARE FRUSTRATED NOBODY WANTS TO SEE NEEDLES ON THE GROUND IN PLAYGROUNDS TO SPECIFICALLY- WHEN YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET. WE HAVE A- THE KERN RIVER INTO OUR DISTRICT AND A LOT OF OUR HOMELESS AND DRUG ADDICTED LIVE ON THE RIVER SO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO WATER- TENSE I MEAN THERE'S CONSTANT GARBAGE ALL KINDS OF FECES ALL ALONG THE RIVER BED IT'S JUST A MESS. BUT WE DO NOTICES THERE'S A LOT OF- A LOT OF NEEDLES- INVENTED WITHOUT TRASHING GARBAGE IS THERE ANY TYPE OF STUDY OR ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN DONE. ON THE IMPACTS- THAT THESE USED NEEDLES ARE THESE NEEDLES THAT THEY'RE USING- IT HAS ON THE ENVIRONMENT- THIS SUMMER VENTILATED YOU WISH TO DRESS THE QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE SOURCE FROM THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WE DREW THIS FROM. THE RESEARCH DOES SHOW THAT AS THE PEAS DO NOT INCREASE SYRINGE LITTER AND COMMUNITY. IN FACT PEOPLE WHO OBTAIN SYRINGES FROM S. C. PEAS FOR MORE LIKELY TO DISPOSE OF THE SYRINGES. PROPERLY I WILL READ A QUOTE FROM THE ABSTRACT THAT I REFERENCED. BUT IT SAYS THAT OBTAINING SYRINGES FROM A SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WAS FOUND TO BE PROTECTIVE AGAINST IMPROPER DISPOSAL. AND INJECTING IN PUBLIC SPACES WAS PREDICTIVE OF IMPROPER DISPOSAL. THUS I'M HAPPY TO GIVE YOU THE SOURCE FOR WHERE THAT CAN. THAT'S VERY GOOD INFORMATION I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SIR FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTION. THANK YOU- CEREMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO MY- YOU KNOW IT'S A COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASSEMBLY REPRESENTING FRESNO- FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AS SOME OF YOU KNOW NAMES BEEN QUITE THE DEFENDERS SECRET DURING THE TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE AND- ALSO BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. THE SYRINGES TAKES PROBLEMS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS AND THAT THEY PROVIDE AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THE LAWSUITS AGAINST THESE PROGRAMS WANT TO ENSURE THAT SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WENT THROUGH SECRET COMPLYING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AND MANY OF THE LAWSUITS ALSO FOCUSED ON NON SECRET ISSUES- SUCH AS PUBLIC NUISANCE CONCERNS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY FIXED BY THIS BILL SO- THREW THE CHAIR AT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE WHAT FOR WHAT ARE THE PROCESSES IN PLACE. THAT THE PROGRAMS USED TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS PARTICULARLY SYRINGE LITTER AND ARE THESE MITIGATION MEASURES CODIFIED IN LAW. OR REGULATIONS. I'M GOING TO ASK HER. TO MARRY SOMEONE WHO IS OUR WITNESS TO COMMENT ON THIS AS THE EXPERT AND APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND- SO. MODERATE PLEASE BRING ON MEMORY CELL UP BACK ON THE LINE AND- HOPE SHE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO QUESTION AND- RESPOND. TO THE QUESTION SEVERAL MONTHS. HI THANKS IT. YES BY AND REGULATIONS- TO ADDRESS SYRINGE WEIGHT ISSUES THE REGULATION THAT IMPLEMENT THE SECTION THAT WERE AT THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WHAT A MAN SHARE THAT IN ORDER TO BE CERTIFIED BY THE PH TO RUN ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS YOU HAVE TO SAY GOT THAT LOOK I AM HAPPY INDICATE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH YOUR INJURY- IT'S ALSO THERE IN THEIR LIVES THAT REQUIRED THAT. HE DISCLOSE THAT AND IT'S VERY VERY PARTICULAR WAY IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART BUT RUNNING A CERTAIN SERVICES PROGRAM TO PROPERLY DISPOSE THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT. AND FINALLY- THERE WOULD REMAIN A NUISANCE CLAIMS WHICH WERE BROUGHT AND SETTLED THE LAWSUIT THEY NEVER BEEN LITIGATED BY A LOCALITY COULD BRING IN NEW PEOPLE CLAIM IF THERE WAS A DIRECT LETTER PROGRAM- PROBLEM DOES THAT ENSURE QUESTION IT DOES THANK YOU AND- AND ANOTHER QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR- AND IN THIS COMPUTER FOR. YOU THIS IS. OR- FOR THE OFF. ARE THERE ARE PRETTY NEAT HE'S FOR PUBLIC AND- TO CALM ON. AS EXCHANGE PROGRAMS- DO THOSE OPPORTUNITIES EXIST. THANK YOU SENATOR AND THE CURRENT PROCESS DOES REQUIRE QUICK CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITH PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERSHIP AND A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND I WILL ASK MARISELA TO PROVIDE ANOTHER LAYER OF DETAIL- VERY SILLY. ACTUALLY THE DOCTOR AND- I HANDLED IT PERFECTLY YES THE REGULATIONS VERY REGULATION BUT ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT THAT PROGRAM MUST HAVE A WAY TO PROPERLY DISPOSE OF THE TREMENDOUS. SAYING THAT THERE'S-A PERIOD OF PUBLIC COMMENT IN CONCORD LET THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALL AS THAT. SO THE REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING SECTION HAVE ALWAYS BUILT IN A CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY- BOTH IN TERMS OF SYRINGE WEIGHTS AND- YOU KNOW PUBLIC OUTREACH. THANK YOU I A. THE INTEREST. AND YOU KNOW I'VE STRUGGLED ON WHERE I'M GOING TO BE BUT I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I DON'T LOOK FOR SECRET SANCTIONS BUT IN MY MIND. BASED ON THE TESTIMONY OF THE ANALYSIS THAT I READ. THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL AS MOST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS KNOW IT- AND I AM A SUPPORTER OF THE SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS- AND THINK WE NEED TO. ENSURE THAT THERE IS PUBLIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR PROJECTS BUT- FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED SEQUEL IS. MEANT TO pPROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER ADMIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- I GUESS I JUST LIKE TO. REFOCUS US BACK ON HEALTH THIS IS THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH ISSUES PUBLIC HEALTH MOST PACIFIC LEE ON THIS AND WE KNOW. THAT THERE IS A LARGE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF A HIV AIDS THAT IS IT THAT THAT THAT IS CREATED AS WELL AS ABSENCES AND INJURIES. FROM DIRTY NEEDLES SO TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A CLEAN NEEDLE EXCHANGE JUST MAKES GOOD COMMON SENSE. AND I GUESS IT ALSO JUST AT IT THIS ALSO GIVES THEM SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF THEM. CONCERNS ABOUT. NEEDLES OUT IN PUBLIC WHICH IS WRONG NOBODY WANTS THAT NOBODY WANTS THAT AT ALL- THAT ANOTHER POLICY THAT HAS BEEN BEFORE THIS. COMMITTEE ON SAFE INJECTION SITES AND IS NOW MOVING TO THE OTHER HOUSE PERHAPS IS. ANOTHER ARGUMENT FOR. THAT LEGISLATION BECAUSE THEN IT NEEDLES ARE NOT LEFT AROUND. AND JUST THOUGHT ON THAT SAME TOPIC WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NEEDLES AND AN IV DRUG USE. WE KNOW RIGHT NOW AND WE'VE KNOWN FOR AWHILE THAT FICTIONAL WHICH WAS MOSTLY ON THE EAST COAST HAS NOW MADE ITS WAY TO CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE AMOUNT OF OVERDOSES THAT WE'RE SEEING AND WILL CONTINUE TO SEE AND THE COMPLICATIONS FROM THAT ARE ONLY GOING TO GROW. AGAIN LEADING TO THE SUPPORT OF A OF THE SAFE INJECTION SITES BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD SO- I THINK IT INSTEAD THE- INTERESTING COMMENTS ABOUT ABOUT SEQUEL BUT I THINK FOR THIS COMMITTEE WE SHOULD STAY FOCUSED ON HEALTH. PUBLIC HEALTH AND- I HAVE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SETON DUMPSTER GROWTH IS YOUR MICROPHONE UPPER. DECKS ON THE SHIP OKAY. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- SOME RAMBLE- I TO THAT STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WOULD MAKE NOTE THIS BILL IS STAN- IF IT PASSES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL GO TO THE COMMITTEE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY WILL PRIDE PERHAPS MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED THE SEQUEL ISSUES- ALTHOUGH I CERTAINLY HAVE MY OWN OPINIONS THAT THIS- THAT SEE BECAUSE BEING MISUSED IN THIS BUT WE WILL LEAVE IT TO THAT THAT COMMITTEE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION- BUT I. DO ALSO WANT TO JUST REINFORCE THIS BEING THE HEALTH COMMITTEE THE PUBLIC HEALTH ASPECTS AND I KNW IT'S REALLY BEEN DESCRIBED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE COMMITTEE- BUT WE KNOW THAT NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS BRING DOWN THE RATE OF. HIV HEPATITIS C. THESE CONTAGIOUS DISEASES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF DIRTY NEEDLES WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DIRTY NEEDLES- THAT END UP ON THE GROUND ARE NOT BECAUSE WE GAVE THOSE NEEDLES TO PEOPLE IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE USING THE DRUGS AND THAT'S AND THEN THEY'RE DISPOSING OF IT IN FACT NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AS YOU CITED IN THE IN THE PAPER. ACTUALLY DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF NEEDLE- WASTE THAT'S THERE SO. CERTAINLY AREAS DON'T THAT- DON'T HAVE NEW SCENES PROGRAM STILL HAVE NEEDLE WASTE. AS AS WELL- I WOULD ALSO JUST MAKE NOTE FOR EXAMPLE- TALKING ABOUT IT SAID THE IMPACT. ON INFECTION IT IS- THE STATE OF INDIANA UNDER A GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE WHO MIGHT HAVE HEARD US- THAT FINALLY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAD AND RAGING HIV EPIDEMIC THAT FINALLY THEY- DID INDEED- EXCHANGE. WHICH FINALLY HELPED THEM BRING IT UNDER CONTROL. RIGHT SO WE THINK ABOUT THE TRADE OFFS HERE- THERE IS MUCH OF A TRADE OFF YOU CAN HAVE LESS DISEASE. AND EVEN PROBABLY LESS WASTE OR YOU GET MORE DISEASE AND- AT LEAST THE SAME IF NOT MORE WASTE SO TO ME IT'S A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD EQUATION. SO IT'S ONLY UP IN SUPPORT YOUR BILL WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT AT THE MOVIES I THINK IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER WINNER- THE MOTIONS DO PASS THE FIRST.

ALL RIGHT WELCOME. VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A B. ONE FOURTEEN THE RARE DISEASE SEQUENCING FOR CRITICALLY ILL INFANTS ACT. WHEN WE THINK OF WELCOMING A NEWBORN BABY WE EXPECT THEM AND HOPE FOR THEM TO BE BORN HEALTHY HAPPY. AND READY TO LIVE A FULL LIFE UNFORTUNATELY SOME INSTANT% INFANTS ARE BORN WITH CRITICAL ILLNESSES. THAT REQUIRE SERIOUS MEDICAL ATTENTION AS SOON AS THEIR LIVES BEGAN. SOMETIMES THE CAUSE OF THE SYMPTOMS ARE NOT EASILY DIAGNOSABLE AND DOCTORS OFTEN HAVE TO RESORT TO INVASIVE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND PROCEDURES. IN THE MOST CRITICAL CASES DOCTORS HAVE TURNED TO GENOME SEQUENCING. OF REVOLUTIONARY AND COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC TOOL. THAT EXAMINES THE STRUCTURE OF A PATIENT'S DNA. THE SIMPLE BLOOD TEST CAN POINT TO ABNORMALITIES FOR EXTREMELY RARE DISEASES. THAT MAY EXPLAIN THE INFANT'S ILLNESSES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS CO CHAIR OF THE RARE DISEASE CAUCUS WE SECURED TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE BUDGET TO FUND PROJECT BABY BEAR. A PILOT PROJECT THAT EXPLORED THE BENEFITS OF RAPID WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING. IF IT WAS TREATED AS THE STANDARD OF CARE. RATHER THAN A LAST RESORT. PROJECT BABY BEAR SEQUENCED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT CRITICALLY IL BABIES ON MEDIC COW AND THE RESULTS WERE IMPRESSIVE. THIRTY FIVE RARE CONDITIONS WERE DIAGNOSED. PATIENTS SPENT AN AVERAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN FEWER DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL. AND ELEVEN FEWER MAJOR SURGERIES WERE PERFORMED. RAPID WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING PRODUCE RESULTS THAT HELP DOCTORS DEVELOP MORE TARGETED MANAGEMENT. OF PATIENT CARE AND ULTIMATELY SAVE THE STATE AN ESTIMATED TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN HEALTH CARE COSTS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS LIFE CHANGING TOOL ISN'T. EQUITABLY ACCESSIBLE. PATIENTS ON MEDI CAL HAVE NEEDED TO RELY ON DONATIONS OR CLINICAL TRIALS IN ORDER TO COVER THE COSTS THE SEQUENCING. AB ONE FOURTEEN SIXTY. AT CLOSE THIS DISPARITY. AND PROVIDE RAPID WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING IS A COVERED MEDICARE BENEFIT FOR CRITICALLY ILL BABIES WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER. RECEIVE AN IN PATIENT CARE AND INTENSIVE CARE UNIT TODAY- WITH AT WITH ME TODAY TELEPHONICALLY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR TWO PIONEERS IN THE FIELD.

WHO WAS BROUGHT TO OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LAST% OCTOBER WITH INCONSOLABLE CRYING FOR TWO HOURS. HIS DOCTOR NOTICED AS NEUROLOGIC EXAM WAS ABNORMAL. AND ADMITTED THE BABY AFTER DOING AN EMERGENCY BRAIN CT SCAN. WHICH CONFIRMED THAT HE HAD AN ABNORMAL BREATHING- FILE THE NEXT DAY HIS MOM AND- CONSENTED FOR US TO DETAILS OF THEIR BABY'S GENOME BECAUSE THERE WERE OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED DIFFERENT GENETIC DISEASES THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE CAUSING HIS SYMPTOMS THIRTEEN AND A HALF HOURS LATER WE HAD PINPOINTED THE CAUSE OF THE BABY'S ILLNESS IT WAS A RARE GENETIC DISEASE BUT ONE WHICH IS EMINENTLY TREATABLE WITH TWO DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS BIETEN AND FIREMAN WE PROMPTLY STARTED THOSE. BABY WENT HOME A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER ON IT EIGHT MONTHS OF AGE SHE'S THRIVING COMPARE HIS CASE WITH HIS OLDER SISTER WHO ARRIVED AT THE SAME EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TEN YEARS EARLIER NOT BACK THEN WE DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING ON THE DIAGNOSIS WAS NEVER MADE IN HER CASE SHE SPENT MOST OF THE ENTIRE ONLY YEAR OF HER LIFE IN HOSPITAL WITH CONTINUOUS SEIZURES BEFORE DYING.

BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TO TWELVE MILLION ADULTS AGE SIXTY AND AOVE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE US CENSUS BUREAU PROJECTS SENIOR CITIZENS WILL OUTNUMBER YOUTH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH FOUND A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES AND DEFICIENCIES IN THE CURRENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STRUCTURE FOR OLDER ADULTS.

EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY THREE IS SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH AND WILL ALSO PROVIDE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT TO THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING AND INNOVATIONS. UNDERWAY FOR MEDICAL AND MEDICARE. IN CALIFORNIA. WE COMPLETED A STUDY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON OLDER ADULTS AND WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT UNMET SERVICE NEEDS AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES ACROSS THE STAGE. WE FOUND FEW PROGRAMS TAILORED FOR THE COMPLEX CARE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS. THOUSANDS OF MEN AND DATA WERE LIMITED AND VARIABLE BY COUNTY. AND IMPORTANTLY THERE WAS A LACK OF LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE FOR OLDER ADULTS MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. OUR FINDINGS WERE SUPPORTED BY A DATA REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNCIL. A THE ESTIMATE SEVEN THOUSAND OLDER CALIFORNIANS IN NEED OF BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH. ONLY EIGHTEEN. OLDER ADULTS ARE 16% OF THE ADULT MEDICAID POPULATION YEAH LESS THAN 3% RECEIVED EVEN ONE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. THE BILL ALSO SUPPORTS THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING- SPECIFICALLY THE HELP REIMAGINE GOALS AND ELSIE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS BEGAN THIS DECISION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE IN PLACE.

DR FRANK. MY RESEARCH INVOLVED MAKING CONTACT WITH SEVERAL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THAT UNDERSERVED OLDER ADULTS WE'RE FACED WITH THE ABSENCE OF COORDINATED SERVICES WHICH MEANT THAT THERE WAS POOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCONSISTENT REPORTING CRITERIA HOWEVER. SOME COUNTIES PREPARED PLANS REQUESTING FUNDING BUT WHEN FUNDS WERE SUPPLIED THE ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY USE THEM FOR OTHER PROJECTS NOT MENTAL HEALTH THIS TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE. OR NO ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH IN MY OPINION IT IS UNACCEPTABLE IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES FACING UNDERSERVED OLDER ADULTS I BEGAN TO SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF. MENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IMPACTING THIS POPULATION LONELINESS ANXIETY DEPRESSION SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND END OF LIFE ISSUES IN ADDITION TO SHELTERING IN PLACE SOCIALIZED IN ADDITION SHELTER HIM PLACE SOCIAL ISOLATION FEAR ANXIETY ALONG WITH- ALONG WITH HIM- ENGLISH CAPABILITY AND A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE EVERY TECHNOLOGY IDENTIFIES MORE ISSUES. FACING THIS POPULATION ACCELERATED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC IT WOULD BE THREE TWO THREE IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES AND INCLUDE SOME CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ASPECTS FOR EXAMPLE STANDARDIZED GERIATRICS TRAINING FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS THAT WOULD COVER CULTURAL LINGUISTIC AND FIXED.

INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO SMOKE CIGARETTES AS INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT SUCH DISORDERS AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM TOBACCO RELATED ILLNESS. AND FROM THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION THAT BRINGS THEM TO TREATMENT. THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION NOTES THAT SMOKING IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER ODDS OF RELAPSE. AND THE CDC RECOMMENDS THE INTEGRATION OF TOBACCO TREATMENT INTO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY FIRST IN THE UNITED STATES ON ASKING ABOUT TOBACCO IN THIRTY SECONDS ON PROVIDING TOBACCO TREATMENT COUNSELING AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT- I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY. THE DEFINITION OF TOBACCO TO INCLUDE ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS REFER TO THE MOST RECENT DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR TOBACCO TOBACCO USE DISORDER.

AND BERMAN EIGHTY FIVE FORTY ONE WHICH REQUIRES A COMPUTER STORAGE FACILITY WITHOUT THE CLIENT FOR TOBACCO USE INFORM PATIENTS HOW CONTINUED TOBACCO USE CAN AFFECT THEIR RECOVERY. AN OPPORTUNITY OR REFERRAL FOR TREATMENT OF TOBACCO USE DISORDERS. AS YOU HEARD ARE THERE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH RATES OF TOBACCO USE AMONG YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. PATIENTS IN THE RANGE OF 70% COMPARISON 211% IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND THE CDC REPORT THAT A FAMILY MEMBER AND MENTIONED. HIM STRAIGHT A POOR SHOWING ON THE PART OF CALIFORNIA RELATIVE TO OTHER TREATING THAT IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. IT CLEAR THAT THE IS SOMETHING JUSTICE ISSUE AND THAT- TOBACCO USE DISORDER AS WE KNOW DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. IN SETTINGS WHERE STAFF IS TRAINED TO TREAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IT IS. OVER TIME TO BACK A DEPENDENT THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR PEOPLE IN RECOVERY. NO JACK WAS OFTEN PARTS OF THE PLAINS PATTERN OF USE OF OTHER SUBSTANCES AND SERVED AS A POWERFUL. POTENTIAL TRIGGER TO REALIZE. HI YOUR NO THAT'S ABOUT TREE AND STOP FUTURE TREATMENT SETTINGS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE. INCREASED THEIR SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY FROM THEIR OTHER SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS BY 25% AND THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT QUITTING TOBACCO DECREASES STRESS AND DEPRESSION.

STAFF WITH MOCKING WITH CLIENTS IN BUYING FACTOR FOR PATIENTS THE MESSAGE WAS THAT TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IS STRESSFUL ENOUGH WITHOUT ALSO ADDRESSING WITHDRAWAL FROM NICOTINE ADDICTION. IN THE WOMEN'S ONLY FACILITY THERE WERE TWO CONSTANTS THAT SMOKING WITH OUR CORPORATE SOCIALIZATION AND THAT SMOKING A COLD STRESS RELIEF GRANTED I WAS INTRIGUED THEM MANY YEARS AGO BUT NOW IS THE LEADER IN OUR INDUSTRY I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN SLOW TO ADOPT BEST PRACTICES. AROUND RECOGNITION AND TREATMENT OF NICOTINE ADDICTION CERTAINLY HELLO IN CALIFORNIA'S OUR STATE RANKS LOW ON TOBACCO TREATMENT IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE THE PATIENTS WE TREAT IN RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS ARE QUITE LIKELY TO HAVE NICOTINE DEPENDENCE CENTER PLAYED BY THE IMPACT OF THAT DEPEND AS LONG AFTER BEING TREATED FOR THEIR PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS. SIMPLY RECOGNIZING IS THAT STILL PUTS FORTH THAT NICOTINE ADDICTION IS IMPACTFUL AND PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR TREATMENT WHAT ENCOURAGES SUPPORT OF POLY SUBSTANCE FREE RECOVERY NICOTINE IS CERTAINLY AN ADDICTIVE DRUG OF CHOICE AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE DELIVERY PERCENT. CIGARETTES PIPES AND CHEWING TOBACCO AND SADLY NOW THEY WHICH ARE PROBLEMATIC ON SO MANY LEVELS FOR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY HI PORT EIGHTY FIVE FORTY ONE AS AN ENTRY LEVEL TOBACCO INTERVENTION FOR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION AS OPPOSED TO MORE SIGNIFICANT CALL TO ACTION.
