WERE INFORMED WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED ON THE LINE WAITING TO TESTIFY SO WE WILL PROCEED AS TO OUR PROTOCOL AND I WILL ANNOUNCE THOSE SINCE. PRIOR TO MAKING SOME TESTIMONY. OUR SU CHI IN PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FORTY FIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATORS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. AB THREE FORTY FIVE. THIS IS A TO YOUR BILL THAT SEEKS TO ADDRESS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THAT HAS EXISTED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FOR TOO LONG. THIS BILL WILL PROTECT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OVER 90% FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FROM THE HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS OF OIL DRILLING IN THE BACKYARDS WHERE CHILDREN LIVE IN PLAY AND GO TO SCHOOL AND WHERE THE SICK AND ELDERLY RECEIVE MEDICAL CARE. THIS BILL RURAL PART THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAM WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY NEAR OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES INCLUDING A REGULATION TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM SETBACKS BETWEEN OIL AND ACTION ACTIVITIES. AND HOMES SCHOOLS PLAYGROUNDS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. STUDY AFTER STUDY LINK THE PROXIMITY TO OIL AND GAS WELLS THROUGH INCREASED RISK OF ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES WHICH ARE OF HEIGHTENED CONCERN DURING THIS CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. OTHER HEALTH RISKS THIS INCLUDES CANCER PRE TERM BIRTHS AND HIGH RISK PREGNANCIES. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN PURSUANT TO S. B. FOUR BY SENATOR PAVOLETTI THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ISSUED A REPORT RECOMMENDING THE MINIMUM OIL DRILLING SETBACKS THAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR. YET DESPITE NUMEROUS STUDIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS CALIFORNIA STILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT OIL AND GAS DRILLING NEAR SENSITIVE LAND USES LIKE HOMES SCHOOLS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. OTHER OIL PRODUCING STATES AS WELL AS CITIES HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED MINIMUM OIL DRILLING SETBACKS. COLORADO AND MARYLAND HAVE ADOPTED A THOUSAND FOOT MINIMUM SETBACK REQUIREMENTS. PENNSYLVANIA WYOMING NORTH DAKOTA LOUISIANA THEY HAVE ADOPTED FIVE HUNDRED FOOT SETBACKS. AND EVEN THE CITY OF DALLAS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS HAS ADOPTED A FIFTEEN HUNDRED FOOT OIL DRILLING SETBACK REQUIREMENTS. CALIFORNIA SHOULD ADOPT AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAM INCLUDING A PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY BUFFER ZONE TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ESPECIALLY WHERE 90% OF NEIGHBORHOOD DRILLING HAS TAKEN PLACE N. BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES. NOW I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF JOBS. AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS BILL WITH THREATEN GOOD UNION JOBS IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND GOOD UNION JOBS. THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE. WE CAN HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND GOOD JOB. FIRST I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS BILL IS COSPONSORED BY ASKED ME YOU D. W. AND SUPPORTED BY SEIU CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IN THEIR LETTER OF SUPPORT ASKED ME YOU W. STATES FOR FAR TOO LONG WORKERS AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM AND CLIMATE CHANGE. AB THREE FORTY FIVE IS A BILL THAT PROTECTS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE CONTINUOUSLY EXPOSED TO FOSSIL FUEL POLLUTION. ON AND THEN OFF THE JOB. SECOND THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ABOUT JOB LOSSES ARE BASED ON A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL WHICH MANDATED A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOOT SETBACK. WE SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED THIS BILL FROM LAST. AFTER THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES PLAN TO INITIATE A RULEMAKING PROCESS TO UPDATE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS FOR COMMUNITIES NEAR OIL AND GAS DRILLING OPERATIONS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE GUIDANCE TO SPECIFICALLY CALL FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES OIL DRILLING SETBACKS. BUT AGAIN LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOOT SETBACK OR A SET BACK OF ANY SPECIFIED DISTANCE. INSTEAD OF THIS BILL DIFFERS THE DEPARTMENT TO CONDUCT ITS MAKING IT ELSE. THANK AND ECONOMIC IMPACT AND ALL ON HOW TO SET. WELL PRESERVING OR A FOR. NEW JOBS. AND SOME THIS BILL IS ABOUT A BAR JUSTICE. AND WE CANNOT FIGHT SYSTEMIC RACISM WITHOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WE CAN HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND GOOD JOBS. I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THIS BILL. I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINED IN THE GALLERY. BY KATE WITH THE VALENZUELA THE POLICY AND POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE. AS WELL AS RUBEN RODRIGUEZ A RESIDENT OF COALINGA AND A FORMER OIL INDUSTRY MECHANIC WILL BE TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AN ON THE RECORD FOR ACCEPTING THOSE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS JUST BEFORE WE MOVED TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- LET ME REMIND YOU THAT DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS. TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS IN CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAY INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY. EACH SIDE WILL BE PER IN AMOUNT OF TIME. AS I DID. IN TODAY THAT WILL BE FOUR MINUTES ON EACH SIDE SO THE FIRST TESTIMONY BROUGHT BY THE AUTHOR IN SUPPORT CAN DIVIDE FOUR MINUTES AMONG THE TWO. AND THEN WHEN WE AND THEN THAT'LL BE FOLLOWED BY THE TELEPHONIC OR PEOPLE THAT MAY BE PRESENT ADD ON NAME. FILIATION AND ENDED YOUR SOME. FOR YOUR OPPOSITION FOR THE BILL THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER TESTIMONY AFTER THE PRIMARY WITNESSES HAVE IS TO THEIR MINUTES. AND JUST BEFORE WE MOVED TO THE WITNESSES LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION HAS NO POSITION ON AB FORTY FIVE. THEY WERE MISTAKENLY LISTED IN SUPPORT ON THE ANALYSIS AND HAVE NO POSITION SO PLEASE CORRECT YOUR COMMITTEE AND ANALYSIS ACCORDINGLY AND NOW WE WILL GO TO THE GALLERY FOR THE TESTIMONY OF KATIE VALENZUELA.

VICE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANNA RISE IN A COUPLE OF COMMENTS REGARDING THE CHAIR'S RULING ON ON CUTTING OFF DEBATE. STAND THAT WERE IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES NOW REGARDING THE PROCUMBENT TEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE'S REACTION. TO THAT PANDEMIC IN OUR STATE- WHICH REQUIRES US TO HAVE- UNPRECEDENTED MEETINGS. AND PRESIDENT TIME FRAMES AND UNPRECEDENTED RESTRICTIONS ON OUR LEGISLATION. WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S POINTED OUT CLEARLY AND I THINK YOU HAVE ACTUALLY DONE A GOOD JOB OF POINTING OUT THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE- HI. FOLKS ON THE LINE THAT ARE WISHING TO COMMENT ON THIS BILL- OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT ON THE LINE I THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT AS WELL. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FOLKS WATCHING IN THE COMMITTEE ARE ALL. ADDITIONALLY IN ENCOURAGED TO GET THEIR COMMENTS WRITTEN AND TO THE COMMITTEE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE THIS BILL. GOES TO THE FLOOR- ONE MORE COMMENT I WANT TO COMMEND THE SENATE CHAIRS AND VICE CHAIRS. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE PRO TEM THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY COLLABORATIVE LEE AND ALL OF OUR COMMITTEES ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BILLS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE TIME. COVET NINETEEN WILDFIRE RESPONSE IN HOMELESSNESS THIS BILL DOES NOT COMPLY WITH ANY OF THOSE THREE ITEMS. AND IN A MEMO THAT I SHARED WITH IT WHICH CHAIR STERN OF THIS COMMITTEE. I ENCOURAGED HIM- AS BEST AS I COULD TO NOT SET THIS BILL FOR HEARING I DON'T THINK IT COMPLIES WITH. WHAT THE SENATE PRO TEM AND ALL OF US AS SENATORS HAVE AGREED. IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE- WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR STATE TODAY. AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE THOSE COMMENTS IN REGARD TO THE RULING OF THE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE FEW MOMENTS TO SPEAK THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR HERE SIR DO LEAN- DID I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE STAFF IN THE MODERATOR WHO HELPED FACILITATE. TECH TO ALLOW AN A RECORD NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE. TELL AND IN THE THING. WHERE GOING TO BRING THE CAR ASIAN. BACK TO THE CA. WE'RE GOING TO TURN FOR. TO SENATORS. JOINS US REMOTELY. ESCAPE SENATORS PLEASE STAND UP BY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD IN OFF ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR THE AUTHOR OR COMMENTS ON AB FORTY FIVE- OUR TEAM HELP BRING IN SENATOR STERN. YES I MEAN. PLEASE SENATOR STERN PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- UNDER. INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND PRESHEAF YOU BEING ABLE TO SERVICE CHAIR TODAY. IN LIGHT OF COVIDIEN MY VERY SENSITIVE CARE TAKING RESPONSIBILITIES I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING THERE TO HELP YOU I DO THIS ALL IN PERSON. I ALSO I DID TO THE VICE CHAIRS POINT I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAD CLARITY IN TERMS OF- THE RULES OF OUR HOUSE- THAT WE'RE WE'RE COMPLYING WITH- PRECISELY THE SENATE'S RULES- IN TERMS OF TESTIMONY SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RIGHT NOW BUT AT SOME POINT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL- GIVEN THE PASSION ON BOTH SIDES. OF THIS ISSUE AND THE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO TESTIFY AN ASSOCIATION WITH VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY HAVE ALREADY TO. IS ONE OF. THERE BEING IS TO. THE CURRENT FOR THE RULING AT THIS SO- BUT THAT'S ONE PROCEDURAL POINT I'M HOPING WE CAN GET SOME CLARITY ON- IT IS SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL HERE ON THIS LEGISLATION. I THINK THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO BE HEARD RIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT. DESPITE THE CODE CRISIS GOING ON AND ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF IT THE ADMINISTRATION IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING ACTION. IN THIS SPACE AND THE OPPOSITION OF THE PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION IS CORRECT THAT THERE ALREADY IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING UNDER WAY AND SO SOME OF YOU MAY ASK THEN WHY IS THIS NECESSARY I THINK TO THE LEGISLATURE HAVING POLICY DIRECTION AND CONTROL OVER MAJOR ISSUES AFFECTING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE HELD THIS NEAR AND DEAR TO PEOPLE WORKING IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY- THERE IS URGENCY TO THIS- THESE JOBS ARE REAL RIGHT NOW THIS CHEN IS REAL RIGHT NOW IN THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS VERY MUCH HERE RIGHT NOW. THIS IS NOT SO. I THINK WE SHOULD BE. TO IT. TO PROCEED WITH A AND ALL DUE RESPECT BECAUSE I SINCERELY ADMIRE- THE GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVE ON THIS AS WELL AS OUR LEADERSHIP AT BOTH CALLIE PA AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY I THINK THEY'VE LAID OUT A- AN EVIDENCE BASED FRAMEWORK. I DON'T THINK THIS BILL CONTRAVENES THAT I DO THINK THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES. TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE AND I WELCOME THAT DEBATE AMONG THE MEMBERS I THINK THAT'S A VERY HEALTHY CONVERSATION TO HAVE IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW HOW HOW YOU LAY OUT A FRAMEWORK. DO YOU TO MANDATE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FOOTAGE FOR SET BACK DO YOU REQUIRE SET BACK AT ALL- IS THERE A BETTER WAY. TO REGULATE OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS ON STRICT HEALTH AND SAFETY BASIS I THINK THERE ARE- VALLEY VIEW POINTS- ON BOTH ON ALL SIDES OF THAT ISSUE I TAKE. THE AUTHORS LEGISLATION TO HEW VERY CLOSELY TO THE PENNY ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION- IF YOU'LL NOTICE A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS SHALL QUE PETER. SO THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED THAT I KNOW IS. CONCERT TWO. MANY OF OUR CALLERS IN MANY OF THE STATE CALL HERE I UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE- NOT A MANDATORY US AMOUNT OF SET BACK BUT THE AMOUNT THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE PRECEDING I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A HEALTHY AN IMPORTANT METRIC TO UNDERTAKE IS A CONSIDERATION BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T MANDATE THAT- I ALSO DON' SEE ANYTHING IN CURRENT LAW THAT WOULD STATE THAT. IS NURSES EARLIER TAKING AND I THINK PRESIDENT THEY SHOWN THAT IN. THE MANY OTHER STATES AROUND THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE SUCH SETBACKS- WE TRIED TO IN THESE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ZONING AND LOCAL. ADMINISTRATORS IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE LAND USE ISSUES BEYOND THEIR IMPACT ON STATE OIL AND GAS AND CLIMATE POLICY OTHER CERTAINLY IS- IMPACT ON LOCAL LAND USE AND ESPECIALLY THE TIME WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD MORE HOUSING- IN OUR BACKYARDS. I EAT I AGREE WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SAYING THERE SHOULD BE. YES IN MY BACK WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT NO IN MY BACKYARD BECOMES THE MORAL AND GASTRIC. BY I GO TO. A LOT OF PLACES THAT LA AND IT MAKES ME VERY ANXIOUS- TO BE WITH. FAMILY FRIENDS LOVED ONES- IN A PLACE THAT I CAN'T ASSURE THEM IS COMPLETELY SAFE AND WE WENT THROUGH THAT A VERY PERSONAL WAY WITH THE LEAST SO CANYON THIS BILL ISN'T STRICTLY LIMITED TO OIL OPERATIONS IT ALSO INCLUDES. A GAS OPERATIONS AND THE PROXIMITY OF A LEASE SO CANYON TO A SUBURBAN COMMUNITY- SHOULD GIVE YOU STARK EVIDENCE AND REMINDERS NOT JUST THE PEOPLE LIVE THERE THE FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN LITIGATION OVER THE POLLUTION THEY FACED AS A RESULT OF THAT URBAN FACED IN GAS FIELD. AND NUMEROUS OTHER OPERATIONS INCLUDING ALLEN CO IN THE HEART OF BELLAY WHICH WAS JUST CITED UNDER CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR THEIR NOT ENDURANCE THE STATE REQUIREMENT- IT THIS MORNING OR LAST NIGHT BY THE CITY ATTORNEY MIKE FEWER. SO I EVERY THIS IS A TOUGH TO- AND I READ AND I READ TRULY DO RESPECT THE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON IT BUT I THINK TO DO A BIG DEAL WE REALLY SHOULD NOT AVOID. AND I DO WELL THANK CONVERSE BECAUSE WE FOR I AYE BE TO PREVENT IS HERE. IN THE NEXT WHILE IF FOR HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTS BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THE BILL IN HERE IS DOLLARS. AND WORTH. PASSING TODAY. THANK YOU SENATORS. IN I HEAR THAT AS A COMMENTARY WITH YOUR OBSERVATIONS NO QUESTION DIRECTED TO THE AUTHOR- I DO NOW RECOGNIZED IN THE QUEUE I HAVE SENATOR HERTZBERG FOLLOWED BY SENATOR JACKSON. IN THEN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR GORGEOUS. CENTER HERTZBERG THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN. BOMB. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT YOU KNOW. WE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. WITH AN AGENCY CALLED DOGGER. WE HAD LEADERSHIP FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE MOLD LAST YEAR IN AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN. BUT NOT JUST RENAME THE AGENCY BUT ALSO REFOCUSED IT TO DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. AND I WANT TO SPEAK AS WE SPEAK HERE TODAY AND ON THIS MEASURE TALK TO KATIE VALENZUELA AND WHAT SHE SAID IF SHE STILL LISTENING OR RUBEN RODRIGUEZ IF HE'S LISTENING. AND THE THOUSAND GRANDMOTHERS THE JACQUI COLD GOLDBERG TOLD ME WE'RE LISTENING THAT MY FRIENDS FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. TEXTED ME AND PAGED AND CALLED. AND I WANT TO TAKE A SERIOUS APPROACH TO WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. BECAUSE IN MY EXPERIENCE IN THIS BUILDING OFTEN MEASURES. TAKE ON A WHOLE LIFE OF THEIR OWN. THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH. AND IN CONTRAVENTION WITH. WHAT THE LAW ACTUALLY SAYS. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ME THOSE WHO WORK WITH THE FOR MANY YEARS WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. LET'S LOOK JUST FOR A MOMENT THROUGH THE TEN THE ELEMENTS ARE GO FAST. WHAT THIS BILL SAYS. AND HOW IT WAS HOW WE AS A GOVERNMENT. ARE RESPONDING TO THE VERY CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT. THE FIRST ONE SAYS. SECTION TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR EIGHT OH FIVE POINT FOR THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES EXIST TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAM WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS GAPS IN EXISTING PROGRAMS POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES THAT MAY IMPEDE ACHIEVEMENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. I SUPPORT IT A 100% CORRECT THE RIGHT THING TO DO AT EVERY LEVEL. BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY AND WHAT IN FURY H. ME AS A LEGISLATOR IS I HAVE BEEN CROSSED. THAT WILL IN THIS LEGISLATURE JUST PASSED BY MAJORITY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT HE CREATES ESTABLISHES A POSITION OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IF YOU LOOK AT SB SEVENTY FOUR ON PAGE NINETY SIX. A MEASURE THAT THIS BODY PASSED IT SETS FORTH IN APPROPRIATIONS FOR THAT MONEY. SO WE'VE GOT THIS ENERGY AND WE'VE GOT THIS ANXIETY WHERE PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR A VOICE IN A BAR MENTAL JOB THIS. AND IS- THIS LEGISLATION HAS DONE EXACTLY THAT. I AM TIRED OF BILLS JUST PUSH PEOPLE'S BUTTONS AND PUSH PEOPLE'S NERVES AND SO I SAY THE CAT KITTY BALANCE WAIVER AND RUBEN RODRIGUEZ MORE ON THE GAME WE'RE DOING THIS WE HAVE PUT IN THE BERMAN. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE VOICE SOMETHING IS TO HAPPEN BEFORE. IT IS COMPLETELY WRONG TO BE ABLE TO PUT LEGISLATION FORWARD IN MY JUDGMENT THAT IS ALREADY BEEN ACTED ON BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO TOUCH PEOPLE'S BUTTONS THAT IT'S WRONG LET. ME WALK THROUGH THE REST OF IT. THREE FOUR. BECAUSE THIS PARA CUMPLIR TALK ABOUT IN FEES BUT DOESN'T HAVE ANY THERE'S NO TO EVEN TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT SAYS UPON FUNDING IN THE FUNDING STUFF ISSUES ARE OVER TO RELEVANT IT'S NOISE. PARAGRAPH THREE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. IT SAYS HONOR BEFORE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE DEPARTMENT ADOPT REGULATIONS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY NEAR OIL AND GAS FIELDS. J. JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO OKAY IT'S NOT AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR GOVERNMENT WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR GOVERNMENT. THE REALITY IS IF YOU GOT IT THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS MEASURE THAT SAYS WE HAVE TO DO ANYTHING IT'S JUST DOT REGULATIONS GUESS WHAT AS A RESULT OF WHAT WE NEED LIMóN DID IT RESTART WISHING THIS AS A RESULT OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND HIS NEW DIRECTION AS A RESULT OF WHAT WAIT CROWFOOT IS DOING HIS DEPARTMENT. THEY'RE ON THE JOB. AND SO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE AND MAKE SURE THAT EQUITY KERR'S IT'S HAPPENING NOW. FORTY THOUSAND COMMENTS. HEARINGS IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH. THIS CALLS FOR RULEMAKING THE WAY RULEMAKING WORKS IS YOUR FIRST LISTEN TO EVERYBODY GET A PRE RULEMAKING GUESS WHAT WE'VE HAD A BUNCH HEARINGS AND GUESS WEN THE NEXT ONE IS IT'S TOM MORROW TOMORROW LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. SO WE HAVE IN THE MAKING AND THEN YOU GO TO THE LEGAL EVIDENCE FREE PROCESS THAT TAKES ABOUT A YEAR. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE ADMINISTRATION IS ABSOLUTELY BASED UPON WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MONIQUE LIMON DID IS ON TRACK TO DO THIS. THIS BILL. VALENZUELA RUBEN HEARD. DIPS IF AND EVERY OTHER GROUP DOES THIS SLOWER THAN WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING IT IT DOESN'T ACHIEVE THE WEEK THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IT GETS WE GET INTO THESE ARGUMENTS AND IT RATHER THAN TO ME ISSUES DO THE HOMEWORK DO THE HOMEWORK READ THE BILL DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING AND MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. PARAGRAPH FOUR DEVILISH MINIMUM SETBACK DISTANCES AND THAT IS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE SAYS THE DEPARTMENT SHALL CONSIDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET SUPPORT TERM BUT DOESN'T REQUIRE IT IT SAYS SHALL CONSIDER IT WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR SAY. THE GOVERNOR SAYS THAT THE RULEMAKING WILL CONSIDER DOESN'T SAY SHALL CONSIDER. IT WILL SPECIFICALLY TO ME WITH ONE OF THE DEBATES WE HAVE ON THIS FOR ALL THE TIME. NOW WE'RE COMMITTEE. IS A DIFFERENCE HE SHALL MAY THEN WILL WILL BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT POLICY. THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S STATEMENT YOU CAN CALL IT A PRESS RELEASE BUT THE COACH DIRECTLY FROM THE GOVERNOR DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY OF RESOURCES. AND BY THE WAY IF THEY DON'T DO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN SESSION NEXT YEAR HEY WE CAN KICK THEIR **** WE HAVE THAT ABILITY BECAUSE OF COURSE. RULEMAKINGS NOT REQUIRED UNTIL. JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. UNDER THIS THING. AND CURRENTLY THEY'RE ON TRACK TO GET THIS DONE. WITHIN A YEAR ADVANCE OF WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR. THE RULEMAKING WILL CONSIDER A RANGE OF PROTECTIVE MEASURES. INCLUDING PROHIBITING OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF HOMES. SCHOOLS HOSPITALS AND PARKS. THE PRE REGULATORY PROCESS WILL BEGIN IN TWENTY TWENTY IT DID. BY THE WAY THE DATA. A. J. NOVEMBER. SENATE MODIFIED RULES OKAY THEY'RE DOING IT THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO SPEND TAXPAYER DOLLARS. YOU HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT EVIDENCE THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE AND IS MOVING AT BREAKNECK SPEED I'M ALMOST FINISHED INSTRUMENT THESE I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR BECAUSE- EVERY ONE OF THESE ELEMENTS WERE ALREADY DOING THIS IS NOT A BILL. ESTABLISHES LAW IT'S JUST NOT WHAT IT DOES NOT WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE THE COMMUNITIES THAT REACHED OUT TO ME BY CONSTITUENTS THE COUPLE DOZEN LAWMAKERS IN LA. THE IT'S IN DEVELOPING THIS WILL IT WILL LOOK AT THE BEST AVAILABLE DATA AND SCIENCE AGAIN IF YOU READ NOVEMBER NINETEENTH IT SPECIFICALLY QUOTES THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO RELY ON THE TALKS ABOUT FOR PRE RULEMAKING DECISIONS THEY'RE ALREADY DONE. ASKING FOR SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE IT'S ALREADY DONE. AND THEN IT SAYS THIS IS THE REAL KICKER. ON OR BEFORE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE DEPARTMENT SHALL PROVIDE AN UPDATE. ON THE PROCESS. AND THE SCRIPTING OF THE REGULATIONS BEING CONSIDERED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCE AND WATER THIS COMMITTEE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DONE BY THAT PERIOD OF TIME. SO YOU KNOW WHEN I LOOK AT THIS BILL. I UNDERSTAND IT TOUCHES NERVES. I GET IT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED THIS MOVE MY WHOLE LIFE. BY LEFT GOVERNMENT LAST TIME I WAS HERE AND I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE WORKING IN. ENVIRONMENTAL SPACE IN VARIOUS ITERATIONS IN COUNTRIES THAT. ARE POOR AND HAVE HUGE CHALLENGES. IT'S IN MY HEART IT'S WHAT I'M ABOUT. BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. THE AUTHOR THIS BILL SENT ME A TEXT LAST NIGHT AT FIVE THIRTY TO FOUR PM SAID DO THE RIGHT THING IS THE RIGHT THING TO READ THE BILL IS THE RIGHT THING TO READ THE BUDGET IS THE RIGHT THING TO TELL THE TRUTH. THIS IS NOT THAT. I LIVE NEAR A BE MY I REPRESENT COMMITTEES NEARLY SO CANYON I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE FIGHTS I AM A BELIEVER BUT I AM BUT I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS REPUBLIC TO DO THE HOMEWORK TO TELL THE TRUTH THE STAND TALL FOR THE VALUES YOU BELIEVE IN BUT DO IT BASED UPON DOING THE HOMEWORK. AND SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I'D LOVE TO HEAR RESPONSES BY THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE BECAUSE I'VE ONE PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH I HAD THE BILL CERTAINLY STUDY IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT. MARCH I'M. UNLESS YOU JUST DON'T BELIEVE THIS GOVERNOR YOU THINK THE SECRETARY RESOURCE A LIAR AND YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE NOT MOVING FAST AND YOU THINK THAT THE ALLOCATION IN THE BUDGET IS FALSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR THANK YOU SENATOR TOM LET ME SEE IF THE AUTHOR IS TO RESPOND AT THIS POINT OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO. DO IT IN YOUR CLOTHES. I CAN RESPOND OUT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU I APPRECIATE TO. THE MAJORITY LEADER. TAKEN A CLOSE LOOK AT AT THIS BILL I KNOW THAT HE IS A- VERY THOUGHTFUL- AND EXPERIENCE POLICY MAKER AND I RESPECT HIS OPINION- BUT I MUST. BY IN TERMS OF HIS CHARACTER CREATION OF THIS BILL DOING NOTHING. HE DIDN'T MAKE THE POINT. THAT THE GOVERNOR. HAS ISSUED HIS PRESS RELEASE- WHERE HE SAID HE WILL CONSIDER. SOME SET BACK A PUBLIC HEALTH INS IN SAFETY BUFFER ZONES TO PROTECT THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING BY REQUIRING. ON SETBACK DISTANCES THOSE ARE TWO AND VERY CLEAR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONSIDERING A SET BACK AND THIS LEGISLATURE MAKING THIS MEANT THAT LIKE IT'S A CROP FREE WE SHALL REQUIRE MINIMUM SET DISTANCE BETWEEN OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES AND SENSITIVE LAPIDES THIS SO. HI I WOULD JUST TO. AT THIS POINT TO MAKE THEIR CLEAR THIS IT WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS HAS ANNOUNCED WHAT THE SECTOR OF NATURAL RESOURCES IS WORKING ON AND WHAT THIS BILL REQUIRES. NEXT IN ORDER SENATOR JACK IN THE FIRST. THANK YOU NOT SURE. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES- MY SENSE IS IF THIS BILL DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WE WOULDN'T OF HAD TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE ON THE LINE MORNING TO TALK ABOUT IT. WHEN THEY'RE- IS SAID IS A LEGISLATURE WE HAVE A DUTY NOT TO ABDICATE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES OUR VALUES AND OUR POLICY MAKING- TO ANY OTHER BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. WE ARE ALL CùNG INCHES WE ALL THIS FUNCTIONS. I THINK IT'S A THERE BE ARE SURE WITH THE GOVERNOR OUR PRIORITIES AND I THINK THE PRIORITY IN THIS BILL OF CONSIDERING SAFETY. AND HEALTH. AS IN A INVITE. ARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WORLD WHERE MY WE KNOW THAT MOST OF THESE FACILITIES ARE BUILT IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO KNOW THROUGH MODERN SCIENCE AND RESEARCH AND MEDICINE THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT SUBSTANTIAL ADVERSE. IMPACTS TO PARTICULARLY CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHEN THEY LIVE NEAR THESE FACILITIES. OUR THIS IS A MEASURE AS I UNDERSTANDIT THAT IGNORE ALLEGES THAT. THAT SAYS ARE THERE SHALL BE SETBACKS AND NO INITIALLY IT'S SAID THAT THEY WILL BE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET OR MORE MY INTEREST IS THAT HAS BEEN A- THE L. THE EXPERT. SITTARD THE SHALL BE SET PROJECT. IN AREAS OF WHERE THEIR SCHOOLS CHILD CARE CENTERS. THESE ARE ARE THESE ARE CHILDREN THESE ARE OUR FUTURE AND THE- THAT WE HAVE NOT THAT WE- I THINK ONE OF THE ONLY OR THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE. OIL PULLING THE- ACT. TO ME THAT'S. STOPPING BECAUSE WE YOU LOOK AT OR- PRODUCING STATE. THEY CHEN ARE NOT IS COMMITTED TO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AS WE ARE HERE. SO I WOULD HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY. HI THIS WITH THE NOTION THAT WE DON'T HAVE A ROLE IN THIS I THINK WE HAVE A CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS- THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE ABOUT HALL ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORK OPPOSITION I'VE BEEN ADVISED IN. THIS IS PERFECT OUR- GET ON YOU KNOW YOU. A STAND IN A QUEUE. DAN OF CATION WORRY DISTINGUISH SUPPORT FOR OPPOSITION I'M TOLD THAT THE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WANTED TO GIVE THERE'S- A TAPE TO EXPRESS IT SO I'M GOING TO LIST A FEW OF THEM. I THINK IT'S PRETTY GIVEN VICE CHAIR. BUT ALL THIS IS IN OUR NATION THE BILL YOU HAD THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE THE FIVE JURISTS INSTITUTE THE CENTER FOR ALL SHE SHE HAD ACQUIRED THIS RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. BAY IN CAP. SO. SHE PLASTIC OCEANS BASHAM PLUS POLLUTION COAL. SAVE OUR SHOW SEVENTY. ADVICE UPSTREAM STORY CHUMASH FUND OF MY DISTRICT ZERO WASTE USA THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP VOICES FOR PROGRESS THREE FIFTY AREA ACT. FOSSIL FREE CALIFORNIA THREE FIFTY RIVERSIDE GREEN ACTION FOR HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BY NATIONAL SHOULD. DEVELOPMENT I'M SORRY. WHAT PART I THINK IT IS WHAT INDEED COMMUNITIES. GREENPEACE SA OIL CHANGE USA STANDING TOGETHER AGAINST NEIGHBORHOOD RULING COALITION. IN THIS IN COUNTY OF WASHING. THREE FIFTY RIVER SUNRISE BAY SUNRISE GILLETTE INVOICE PRAGUE WAS ARE JUST AMONG THE GROUP AND DID NOT GET IT TO. SO I SAY THAT CLERK TO CLEAR THE RECORD AND TO WITH THAT UP IN MARIN MIDDLE JUSTICE WE KNOW THE IMPACT OF WHAT NO THAT CONSERVE. IS A BILL TO REQUIRE THAT WE LOOK AT IT AND PUT IT. BEING OF OUR COMMUNITY AND IT CALLED WORLD WE HAVE THE SEPTA UNITIES ARE MY CAR OF. THE CAR. OF WAR. WE COMMUNITIES OR NEAR THEIR COMING. THIS IS CLEARLY INITIAL. PROPRIO BROUGHT HERE TODAY ARE N. DOT APPRECIATE THE OFF BRING IN BILL AND WILL VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR I WILL ROOM BOTH SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS IF YOU'RE- COMMENTARY WASN'T HEARD TODAY YOU ARE WELCOME TO SUBMIT IN WRITING TO THE NATURAL. IN ORDER IT WILL BE THIRD. IN TWO NOTED AS PER OF THE PER. TODAY RIGHT NOW MOVING TO SENATOR PORCHES YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU MISTER. I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I HEAR THE MAJORITY LEADER OF PUT UP IS MIKE AND SPEAK SO FORCEFULLY ON AN ISSUE. CAPTURES MY ATTENTION. WHAT I HEARD FROM THE MAJORITY LEADER ON THIS BILL IS THAT IT. UNDER DELIVERS AND IS NOT TERRIBLY RELEVANT TO THE MORE SIGNIFICANT- EXECUTIVE ACTIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING RIGHT NOW. SO I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POLITICAL BACKGROUND UNDERSTAND ALL THE AGREEMENTS AND ALL THE DISCUSSIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE GONE ON. THE SUBJECT MATTER. BUT THAT DOES GIVE ME PAUSE THAT IF THE GOVERNOR AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTALITY IS GOVERNMENT. ARE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION ALBEIT EVEN QUICKER THAN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WOULD ALLOW THEN I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A AS A STEP BACK SAYING WE- CLING DO ANYTHING OF REAL SIGNIFICANCE HERE. AND IF NOT WE SHOULD. SERIOUSLY TO VIOLATE WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL SHOULD HAVE EVEN BEEN HEARD TODAY. AND I IN MIND. IN THIS. IS THAT THE BIG OF THE CALL EXPERIENCE WE WERE OUT BY LEADERSHIP IN WRITING AND ORALLY TO DRUM. RE ORIENT JUSTLY TO FOCUS TO THE IT THAT ONE SIGNIFICANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FIRST AND FOREMOST KOBE NINE RELATED MATTERS WILDFIRES HOMELESSNESS THAT EVENTUALLY GOT PARED DOWN TO DOES THIS HAVE A EMERGENCY INSIGNIFICANCE A COMPONENT ESPECIALLY IN THE COVERED CONTACT. I WOULD FROM TWELVE BILLS DOWN TO TWO I KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES- HEEDED THOSE RECOMMEND BY THE PRO TEM AND SIMILARLY DRAMATICALLY SCALED BACK THEIR LEGISLATIVE PACK. SO IF THAT WAS THE DIRECTION OF THIS BODY AND I BELIEVE THERE WAS COUNTERPART DIRECTION FROM THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AS WELL. WHY ARE WE LOOKINGAT A BILL LIKE THIS. DURING A PANDEMIC. THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST I'M NOT EVEN CERTAIN THIS SHOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD IN THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE THEY SHOULD PROBABLY BE WHICH TO BE DEFERRED I THINK TO JANUARY. THE SECOND IS. WHAT IS THE COST. ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. THAT WE TALK ABOUT SETBACKS I HAVE TWO LITTLE BOYS. WHO WERE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I EIGHTY I'M HERE I CAME FROM A FAMILY OF EDUCATORS I HAVE A SOFT SPOT MAKING CERTAIN THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK SET AS I AM IN MY PREVIOUS COOPER ON THE OF SUPERVISORS IN A FIRE CON. AT BELIEVE THAT. LOOKING AT EIGHT UNDER. THIS OF ORACLE. IN THIS ED EXPERIENCE. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WELLS AND EXTRACTION SITES BEING SHUT DOWN TO THE TUNE OF I THINK ONE BEST WAS 60% 66% THE OIL AND GAS WELLS IN LEE COUNTY ALL. DOWN MY BRAIN IDEA THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE IN A COVERT CONTEXT. YET SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING PREPARED TO SHED THOUSANDS OF JOBS WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT. HAS SKYROCKETED EDT HAS NOT BEEN PERFORMING AT A LEVEL THAT IS MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES- RELATIVELY FUNCTION. MY LAST POINT ON THIS. WHAT DOES A GLORIA REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM TO HELP ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN AGENCY REGULATORY PROCESSES. I'VE BEEN AROUND GOVERNMENT LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU HAVE LANGUAGE LIKE THAT INCORPORATED INTO. BILL I BECOME SUSPICIOUS. IF IT'S TRUE TRULY ABOUT HEALTH AND WELFARE. ABOUT MAKING CERTAIN THAT THERE'S A SETBACK BETWEEN EXTRACTION SITES IN SCHOOLS EXTRACTION SITES AND HOSPITALS. THAT GIVING MONEY TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS TO BECOME ADVOCATES ARE IN IT IN ADVANCE. A POLITICAL AGENDA I'M NOT SO CERTAIN IS THE USE OF TAXPAYER MONEY. SO WHEN YOU ADD IT ALL UP THIS IS COVE IN NINETEEN RELATED. THIS IS GOING TO SHED JOBS AT THE WORST TIME POSSIBLE IT'S GIVING MONEY AWAY TO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TO PURSUE A- LEGISLATIVE SET OF. ORDERS I THINK SHOULD DEFINITELY BE WITHDRAWN IN BROUGHT BACK IN JANUARY AND ON TOP OF THAT I'D LOVE TO SEE A COST ESTIMATE THAT IF ALL THESE EXTRACTION SITES WERE SHUT DOWN. WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN TO OUR ECONOMY TO OUR EMPLOYEES INTO THOSE THAT RELY ON THAT SOURCE OF INCOME. THANK YOU SENATE MOVING NEXT SENATOR WAY SO YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK HELLO THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE UNNECESSARILY TODAY I THINK THE POINT WAS MADE BY SENATOR HERTZBERG THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ASSIST UNDER THAT'S MUCH MORE DETAIL THAN THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL THAT WILL MORE THAN IN THIS BILL WILL PLUS. ONLY THE THAT PROCESS WHICH I DON'T SUPPORT. BUT I DO WANT TO SPY I THINK I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHY WE'RE HERE IN AND OUT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A GOOD ANSWER UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT NOT TO PLEASE WILL LIVE. HERE THIS IS ACTUALLY A WASTE OF EVERYBODY'S TIME UNFORTUNATELY. AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO EVERYBODY THAT HAD CALLED IN TODAY I. WANNA APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYONE IN THE PUBLIC FOR THIS. THIS THIS EXERCISE IT REALLY WILL NOT REALLY ACHIEVE. ANYTHING AT ALL WHEN YOU WERE HERE. BUT TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNORS ARE TAKING. AND HOW DETAILED IT IS AND HOW. IT'S GONNA DRESS SOME OF THE YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL. SEEKS TO DO CERTAIN THINGS BUT SO DOES THE INTENT OF THE WORK OF THE GOVERNOR AND I THINK IT'S MORE DETAILED AND I THINK IT'S A- HOME THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT I THINK IS AT LEAST MORE CLEAR THAN WHAT IS BILL THIS BILL IS BROUGHT BILL IS NOT CLEAR THE BILL REALLY DOES NOT AYE DIRECTION SO WE GET THE LEGISLATURE. IT PROVIDING THE WE NEED DETAILED. BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR HAS TO BE PRESENTED MORE DETAILED DIRECTION BUT THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PUBLICITY STUNT AND AT A TIME WHEN WE CANNOT. THANK TWO BILLION HERE THE RULES THAT WERE SET UP BY THE LEGISLATURE TO ONLY WORK ON BILLS. THAT ARE ESSENTIAL CURRENTLY TO THE STATE I INTRODUCED FOURTEEN BILLS THIS YEAR I'M DOWN TO ONE. ONE BILL I USED A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL BILLS BILLS THAT WOULD HELP OUR ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA WHY DID THOSE BILLS DIE AND WHY ARE WE HEARING THIS ONE. WHY IS THIS BILL IMPORTANT IN MY BILLS ON THE ENVIRONMENT I HAD A BILL THAT WAS GOING TO HELP TO RECYCLE PLASTIC. AND ALSO CREATE JOBS AND ALL. REMOVE PLASTIC FROM OUR OCEANS AND RIVERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES I HAD A BILL. THAT WAS GOING TO HELP. CHILDREN GET ACCESS TO. AFFORDABLE INTERNET. AT A TIME RIGHT NOW I GOT A I GOT A CALL FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT EDUCATION TALKING ABOUT HOW THERE ARE SO MANY CHILDREN ARE STATE THAT HAVE STARTED SCHOOL THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET I WAS THAT BILL TAKE. A THAT IS A CO PLAYED A BILL YEAH WE CAN'T DISCUSS IT BUT WE'RE ALREADY DISCUSSING THIS BILL. THAT WILL REALLY DO NOTHING THAT WERE NOT ALREADY WORKING ON THERE'S A SLEW OF BILLS THAT I SUPPORTED S. B. THIRTY TWO BY HELP BE BEST FOR BY. THE ONE EIGHTY NINE FOR AYE GARCIA. SO MANY BILLS DEAL WITH. AND ENVIRONMENTAL TESTS THAT I HAVE SUPPORTED OVER THE YEARS AND I'M GLAD STAND HERE IN SUPPORT AND NOT JUST. TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES. FOR POOR QUALITY. FIVE I NEVER MISSED OF A- IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO STAND. AND ANSWER QUESTIONS AUTHOR AND HIS MOTIVES BUT I HAVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO RELIEVE. SEN HERE IN DISAPPOINTMENT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS LENGTHY DEBATE. A LENGTHY DEBATE ABOUT A BILL THAT'S ALREADY BEEN. ADJUDICATED THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I JUST THAT I FOR THAT. VERY DISAPPOINTING. ALL BILLS BUT I. HAVE WORKED ON ARE DOWN TO ONE. DOWN AT I'M STILL STRUGGLE TO GET A- FOR THAT BILL AND SO YET WE'RE HERE DISCUSSING BILL THAT'S ALREADY IN THE WORKSTO BE RESOLVED. THAT WE WORK HARD TO PUSH. STATE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS WE WERE FINALLY THERE AND THEN WE HAVE A DEBATE ON THIS. BILL UNNECESSARILY AND MISTER CHAIR I'M JUST FRUSTRATED SORRY FOR MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU SHARE THE COMMENTS. SEEING NO OTHERS IN THE QUEUE I WILL TO EXERCISE THE PROGRESS OF THE CHAIRED OFFER A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS AND TURN IT TO THE OFFICE. FOR HIS CLOTHES. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE RESPECTFUL NATURE. OF THE ENGAGEMENT AND AS WELL AS THOSE WHO. HATED REMOTELY. A LITTLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THIS LEGISLATION I DO SEE VERY DIRECT CODE NINETEEN NEXT. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TRENDS OF COVERT NINETEEN INFECTION AND DEATHS IN OUR COMMUNITIES IT IS HIGHER AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IT'S BASED ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS WHERE WE HAVE COMMUNITIES. OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OFTEN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO ALSO LIVE IN THE MOST TOXIC. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES ASTHMA WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF OTHER CHILDHOOD DISEASE AND CLUSTERS OF CANCER. AND NOT SURPRISINGLY WE FIND THOSE OFTEN PROXIMITY. TO OIL EXTRACTION IN OIL PRODUCTION. ONE THING THAT'S DISTURBING TO ME. IT SAID AS WE FACE COVERT NINE. IT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS JUST AS THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND THEY CONVERGE. IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER THE CLIMATE CRISIS PEOPLE OFTEN LOOK TO AS BEING PROSPECTIVE IT'S IN FRONT OF US FRIENDS IT IS HERE RIGHT NOW AND IT EXACERBATES WHETHER. WATER IMPACTS IN OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS THAT AFFECT DISADVANTAGED. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LABOUR RIGHTFULLY RISES WITH CONCERN OF JOB LOSS AND DISPLACEMENT. AND YET FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT SAME WORKFORCE LIVES IN COMMUNITIES THAT FACE SIMILAR PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS. WE NEED TO EMERGE FROM THIS CONVERSATION AND FIND THE PATHWAYS WHERE LABOR AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY. HE WE TOGETHER. TOOK GOOD PAYING MIDDLE CLASS UNION JOBS WORKING IN CLEAN ENERGY SECTOR AND WE'VE SEEN THAT TRANSITION HAPPENING MANY IN THE BUILDING TRADES ARE WORKING IN CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. IN THAT ARENA BUT DIFFER ON THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT NOT COVERT NINETEEN RELATED IF WE LOOK AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT. I'VE COVERED NINETY. HE RECOMMEND THE SUGGESTION CONTAINED IN THIS LEGISLATION ADDRESS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HEAD ON I WILL URGE AN AYE VOTE IN I WILL. NOW TO THE AUTHOR FOR HIS CALL THANK HIM FOR HIS PATIENTS- IN BRINGING THE BILL TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS MISTER AUTHOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- STRONG. WORDS POURED FOR THIS BILL I THINK OF. YOU HAVE ADDRESSED AND I WOULD- ECHO- YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE DIRECT NEXUS BETWEEN THIS BILL AND BECAUSE OF IT. YOU KNOW WE- ARE AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE TALKING A LOT NOT ONLY ABOUT THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC BUT WE'RE ALSO TALKING A LOT ABOUT. THE SYSTEMIC RACISM. IN AMERICAN SOCIETY AND HOW THIS COVERED NINETEEN IMPACT HAS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES. AND THIS ISSUE OF OVER 90% OF OIL DRILLING TAKING PLACE N. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE NEXUS BETWEEN COVER NECK THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. HOW IT SUPPOSES THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT IT IN OUR STATE. AND IN OUR COUNTRY AND SO THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO EXPRESS. I'M SORRY THAT THE CENTER FROM SAN DIEGO THINKS THAT THIS MAY JUST BE A PUBLIC PUBLICITY STUNT. YOU KNOW I WOULD REMIND THE SENATOR THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOUR BILLS BUT THIS IS ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT IT. FACING MANY BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE TALK A LOT ABOUT. HOW WE LET SCIENCE PREVAIL OVER POLITICS WE NEED TO. B. LED BY SCIENCE AND NOT BY POLITICS. INSIDE LIKE TO CLOSE. AMPAS THAT. OUR SCIENTISTS OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS ARE SAYING THAT WE NEED A MINIMUM SET BACK AND- THAT ONE KEY POINT IS AGAIN MY RESPONSE TO THE MEDIA MAJORITY LEADER THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. A BILL THAT REQUIRES A SET BACK AND THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCING IN A PRESS RELEASE THAT HE'S GOING TO CONSIDER SET BACKS THE QUESTION BEFORE THIS BODY TODAY ONE OF THE LEGISLATURE AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THINKS IT IS IMPORTANT. AS A POP CULTURE PARM THAT'S YOUR. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS. JUST LAST YEAR FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN ISSUED A RECOMMENDATION THAT LOS ANGELES CA ON A NEEDS TO EXPAND ITS MINIMUM SETBACK DISTANCES BETWEEN SENSITIVE LAND USES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF OIL WELLS. WE HAVE EVERY A STUDY THAT JUST CAME OUT FROM THE UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEN AGAIN. HIGHLIGHTS THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY TO OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT BIRTH OUTCOMES PARTICULARLY RURAL COMMUNITIES. THIS IS MORE. THIS IS MORE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THIS COMPELLING NEED FOR THE SET BACK. YOU KNOW I- I REGRET. THAT LABOR. IS OPPOSING THIS BILL BECAUSE I CAN'T I THINK IT'S A FALSE CHOICE. BETWEEN JUSTICE AND HAVING GOOD UNION JOBS. MANY OF THE STATEMENTS MADE ABOUT THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUES THE THOUSANDS OF JOBS THAT ARE THREATENED BY THIS BILL. IS TO SUPPORT ANY FEAR MONGERING. MANY OF THESE STATISTICS ARE BASED ON THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL THAT WAS CALLING FOR A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOOT. SETBACK THAT WAS. AGAIN IT IS WHERE WE ARE REQUIRING. THE DEPARTMENT TO ESTABLISH A MINIMAL SET BACK BUT LEAVING IT UP TO THE DEPARTMENT TO BALANCE THE CONSIDERATION BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC IMPACT WE DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND HAVE A GOOD JOBS. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI- I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTIONDO WE HAVE A MOTION ON AB THREE FORTY FIVE I HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR JACKSON.
