GOOD MORNING OF WELCOME TO ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY. M. WILL WAY TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM AT IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE GOING TO START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE SINCE MISS QUIRK IS HERE. WISH. FOR THE FIRST ONE. EVER GONNA HEAR FROM MS DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER. WORKGROUP STARS A SUBCOMMITTEE AS SOON AS WE. HAVE A QUORUM WE WILL VOTE. I LATE ITEM TWENTY FOUR. AB TWO TWENTY FIVE FIFTY CALIFORNIA TUITION FOR WOMEN MALE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. THANK YOU OF GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY FIVE IFTY A BILL RECOGNIZING THE HUMANITY OF WOMEN IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND I ACCEPT ALL OF THE COMMITTEES AND AMENDMENTS. MANY OF OUR FOR AN I AM MUCH REFER A. VISITORS ARE HERE TODAY BUT IF THEY ARE THAT'S FINE WE WILL COMPLETE SEAT. UP MANY OF OUR PRISON POLICIES ARE DESIGNED FOR MEN IN MIND AND DO NOT REFLECT WOMEN'S NEEDS. WOMEN ARE THE FASTEST GROWING POPULATION UNFORTUNATELY BEHIND BARS AT A RATE THAT FAR EXCEEDS INCARCERATED MEN. AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY MORE THAN EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF WOMEN LOCKED UP ARE SURVIVORS OF PHYSICAL. UP PAST PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE. ACCORDING TO THE PRISON LAW OFFICE THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR WOMEN HAS SUICIDE RATES FOUR TO FIVE TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR ALL PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN FEMALE STATE PRISONS. FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN WOMEN COMPRISE FOUR PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION BUT ACCOUNT FOR ELEVEN PERCENT OF SUICIDES. SEARCHES WHILE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE SAFETY ARE OFTEN POWERFUL RIM REMINDERS OF TRAUMA. IN THESE INSTANCES IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE REQUIRE TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES. WOMEN CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS PERFORM THESE SEARCHES CAN MAXIMIZE FEELINGS OF PHYSICAL SEXUAL EMOTIONAL AND RELATIONAL SAFETY FOR WOMEN. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PUT REDUCE THE POTENTIAL THAT STAFF ACTIONS WILL TRAUMATIZE A RE TRAUMATIZED PEOPLE IN WOMEN'S PRISONS BY PROHIBITING MAIL OFF CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. FROM PAT DOWN SEARCHES BEING IN VIEW OF OR RETURNING INTO AN AREA WHERE INCARCERATED WOMEN. ARE IN A STATE OF UNDRESS SUCH A SHOWER ROOMS AND BATHROOMS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS BILL ALSO SEEKS TO HOLD CORRECTION OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE ENSURE THE DOCUMENTATION IS SUBMITTED WHEN WOMEN ARE PET SEARCHED ARE SEEN IN A STATE OF UNDRESS BY MAIL. OFF A MALE GUARDS THIS COMMONSENSE BILL ALIGNS CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE WOULD BEST PRACTICES AND THE FEDERAL PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SCOTT IS SPONSORED BY CUTS THE CUTS IF I MEAN HAS TAX CUT FIFTY AND THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION SUPPORT AND SUPPORTED BY THE ACLU. ARE ALL LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE IN THE PRISON LAW OFFICE. I'M NOT SURE OF ME OUT TO MIDNIGHT IS HERE WHO WAS FROM THE COMMUNITY GAZE WHAT DIRECTOR.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BUILD A PLACE HERE REPRESENTING CUT FIFTY I APOLOGIZE A OUR PEOPLE MIGHT'VE GOTTEN. CAUGHT UP IN THE TRAFFIC. THIS BILL EXCELLENT BILL AND IT'S PART OF A NATIONAL PROGRAM THAT. SEEKS TO. ADDRESS A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER. OTHER DIRECTIONS OF THIS CAN GO. IN THE FUTURE OF OTHER LEGISLATION BUT. WE FEEL THIS IS A VERY VALUABLE. VERY VALUABLE BILL AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CDC ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE COVERED. THAT WOULD BE THINGS FOR INSTANCE. EMINENT ESCAPE A RISK DISASSOCIATED STAFF OR TO. INMATE. AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DOCTOR WEBER YOU MAKE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE? I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND THANK YOU CUT FIFTY FOUR. SPONSORING A BILL. DR WEBER YOU MAY CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE HUMANITY IN THE WOMEN'S WHEN WOMEN BEHIND BARS AND MOVE FOR WITH COMPASSION AND TREATMENT. I'M GRATEFUL THAT CUT OF THAT HAS TECH AT FIFTY ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR IS ONE OF THE FIRST ISSUES OBVIOUSLY THE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF ISSUES RELATED TO WOMEN IN PRISON. BUT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE OF BILL THAT BASICALLY MOST OF US WOULD AGREE WITH THAT PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF SAFETY. AND DOUSED HOPEFULLY SECURITY FOR THE WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED I RESPECTFULLY ASK ME I BOTH AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY. OKAY DOT WEBER AND. THIS BILL ENJOYS A A AND I RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR. AND OF ONCE WE GET. QUORUM. WILL BE ABLE TO. AND. WE WOULD VOTE ON A. DEL ONLY THING I'M I'M SORRY DO WE HEAR FROM ALL YOUR YOUR WITNESSES I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR EVERYBODY THEIR EUROPA VERY INTERESTING WOMEN WHO ARE STRONG ADVOCATES AND I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT. YOUR ACTION THIS BILL HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE BUT WHEN YOU GOT A QUORUM. THANK YOU HAVE MY WHAT MICHAEL LOT THIS HERE MISTER LET. THE SUREST. NEXT IS. MISTER GLORIA. TODD. AB TWENTY ONE. BOTH THREE. GOOD MORNING SHARON GOOD MORNING I AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I BRING BEFORE YOU TODAY EIGHT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE OH THREE. COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO CARRY A LOADED CONCEALED WEAPON. YOU MAY KNOW THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW PERSON WAS NEVER EVEN FIRED A GUN OR RECEIVE PROPER TRAINING ON HOW TO SAFELY HANDLE ONE CAN RECEIVE A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT. FROM A LOCAL JURISDICTION AND IN LEGALLY CARRY A LOADED FIREARM IN PUBLIC. I BELIEVE IT'S PUTS THE PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK. AS THESE DEADLY WEAPONS COULD IT UP THE WRONG AN UNTRAINED HANDS. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AB TWENTY ONE OH THREE ESTABLISHES SOME COMMON SENSE STANDARDS FOR CONCEALED CARRY APPLICANTS. FIRST A BETWEEN ONE OF THREE WOULD REQUIRE ALL TRAINING COURSES CURRENT CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR CONCEALED WEAPON LICENCES TO BE AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS IN LENGTH. WELL STATE LAW CURRENTLY ESTABLISHES A MAXIMUM OF SIXTEEN HOURS FOR THE TRAINING COURSES THERE'S CURRENTLY NO MINIMUM. WE BELIEVE IN EIGHT HOURS. ACQUIREMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT LICENSING AUTHORITIES OF ALREADY REQUIRE FOR CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS AND IN MUCH CALIFORNIA. SECONDLY AB TWENTY ONE A THREE REQUIRES CONCEAL CARRY APPLICANTS TO DISTRICT TO DEMONSTRATE SAFE HANLEY PROFICIENCY ON A FIRING RANGE. AGAIN WITH THIS PROVISION WE ARE CODIFIED BEST PRACTICES DRAWING HEAVILY FROM WHAT LOCAL LICENSING AUTHORITIES GENERALLY REQUIRE. HOWEVER IN THIS CASE WE ARE WHERE AT LEAST ONE LICENSING AUTHORITY DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY LIVE FIRE TRAINING. IN MY MIND THAT COULD THAT COULD HAVE THE PERSON. BEEP AUTHORIZED TO CARRY A CONCEALED PERMIT IN A WEAPON IN PUBLIC WITHOUT DEMONSTRATE PROFICIENCY. A WHICH IS ULTIMATELY A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. LASTLY RECENT ADMINISTERED AB TWENTY ONE OR THREE REQUIRE LOCAL LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC LIVE FIRING PROFICIENCY STANDARDS TO MAKE THOSE STANDARDS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. WE BELIEVE AT THIS PROVISION IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE RIGOROUS UNIFORM STANDARDS AMONG TRAINING PROGRAMS WHILE THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING LOCAL CONTROL. TO PUT THIS BILL IN PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIA REQUIRES APPLICANTS FOR DRIVERS LICENSES TO DEMONSTRATE BEHIND THE WHEEL PROFICIENCY OF A VEHICLE BEFORE THE DMV WILL ISSUE A LICENSE. YES STATE LAW FEELS PRESCRIBE SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS FOR CONCEALED CARRY WEAPONS THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO REMEDY. AS MENTIONED MOST SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL LICENSING AUTHORITIES RD ADOPT SIMILAR KINDS OF PROVISIONS IN THE LOCAL POLICIES AND WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. THAT IS WHY AB ONE A WEEK AB TWENTY ONE OR THREE IS SO NECESSARY WE MUST ESTABLISH A FLOOR TO MAKE SURE THAT STANDARDS DON'T FALL BELOW IT. AS THEY DO IN OTHER STATES I'M PROUD TO COUNT THE CALIFORNIA SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE INEQUALITY CALIFORNIA AMONG THEM WITNESSED OF MANY SUPPORTERS OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. SEACM THIS MORNING WE ARE WITH ITS SHARES INDULGENCE I HAVE THREE WITNESSES WHO WILL AGREE TO SPLIT THEIR TIME AND IT HERE TO THE COMMITTEES LONG STANDING AND VERY WISE RULES. DAVID BRAIN OF ROCKLAND A FATHER HUSBAND AND NO ARMY VETERAN GUN OWNER AND SUPPORTER OF COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA. I'D JONES OUT KAZERUN IAN. SEE I DON'T PARTISAN NOW LOS ANGELES AREA AYE DANVILLE. RESIDENT A MOM AN EDUCATOR IN THE LEAD BUT LOCALLY FOR MOMS DEMAND ACTION FOR GODS AND. CPO COUNTY MANY OF YOU MAY RECOGNIZE RICHARD A WITNESS TEAR A TIRELESS ADVOCACY FOR GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC DEATH OF HIS SON CHRISTOPHER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE TWENTY FOURTEEN. ISLA VISTA RAMPAGE ALTERED OVER TO MY WITNESSES NO COULD YOU JUST WE WANT TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM WHAT WE HAVE MEMBERS HERE AND THEN WE'LL GET RIGHT TO YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU SIR MAN FACTOR. JONES SAWYER HERE LACKEY. CARDIO. GONZALEZ FLETCHER KILEY. QUIRK. SANTIAGO. QUORUM IS PRESENT YOU MAKE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS RICHARD MARTINEZ. BUT I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE MY SON CHRISTOPHER IS DEAD. SHOT AND KILLED IN ISLA VISTA CALIFORNIA ON MAY TWENTY THIRD TWENTY FOURTEEN. CHRIS WAS A STUDENT AT UC SANTA BARBARA JUST TWENTY YEARS OLD. HE WAS OUR ONLY CHILD AND HE WAS THE CENTER OF OUR LIVES. HE WAS EVERYTHING TO US. NOTHING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME BEFORE CHRIS WAS KILLED IS IMPORTANT TO ME NOW. THE ONLY THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME NOW IS THE WORK THAT I DO TO TRY TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY. I DON'T WANT ANOTHER FAMILY TO EXPERIENCE OUR LOS. AS AMERICANS AND CALIFORNIANS WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT TO PROTECT OUR FAMILIES BY ADOPTING COMMON SENSE MEASURES. CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT. TO REDUCE IT INJURIES GUN INJURIES AND DEATH. I'M HERE WITH YOU TODAY TO SUPPORT A COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURE THAT WILL HELP PROTECT OUR FAMILIES. AB TWENTY ONE OH THREE WOULD REQUIRE PEOPLE WITH CONCEALED CARRY LICENSES TO COMPLETE LIVE FIRE SAFETY TRAINING BEFORE. THEY CAN CARRY A CONCEALED LOADED GUN IN PUBLIC. AS THE U. S. ARMY VETERAN I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF LIVE FIRE SAFETY TRAINING. I'VE TRAINED WITH THE M. SIXTEEN. FORTY FIVE CALIBER HANDGUN SHOTGUN AND M. SIXTY MACHINE GUN. TWENTY FIVE STATES HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT AND CALIFORNIA DOES NOT. WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE LICENSED TO CARRY CONCEALED LOADED GUNS IN OUR STATE ARE PREPARED TO DO SO SAFELY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO SUPPORT OF BELT TWENTY ONE NO THREE REQUIRING LIVE FIRE TRAINING FOR CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS IN OUR STATE. MY NAME IS JOAN BECAUSE IRANIAN BY BACKGROUND IS IN EDUCATION AND CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. I'M A CO LEADER OF CALIFORNIA CHAPTER MOMS DEMAND ACTION FOR GUN SENSE IN AMERICA AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I AM A MOM. I GOT INVOLVED IN GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION AFTER THE ISLA VISTA SHOOTINGS BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN MY DAUGHTER. AS SHE WAS THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL. INSTEAD. IT WAS HER PEERS LIKE CHRISTOPHER RICHARDSON WHO WERE TRAGICALLY SHOT AND KILLED THAT HORRIFIC EVENING. ALL BECAUSE OF A YOUNG MAN THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAD A GUN IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE AT THAT TIME WE DID NOT HAVE A SAFETY LINE PLACE LIKE OUR CURRENT GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN A MECHANISM TO THE SHOOTERS FAMILY AS WELL AS LAW ENFORCEMENT. I AM PROUD THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER ON GUN SAFETY LAWS BUT UNLIKE TWENTY FIVE OTHER STATES WE DO NOT HAVE A LAW REQUIRING LIVE. FIRE TRAINING FOR PEOPLE PERMITTED TO CARRY AHEAD AND LOADED GUN IN PUBLIC. AMENDED THE LAW TO REQUIRE THE LIFE RIGHT FIRE TRAINING FOR CONCEALED CARRY WOULD MEMORIALIZE AND PRESERVE A POLICY THAT CALIFORNIA SHARES AND POLICE CHIEFS HAVE RT ADOPTED AND WANT. ADDING A LIVE FIRE TRAINING REQUIREMENT INTO STATE STATUE WOULD INSURE THAT THIS COMMON SENSE REQUIREMENT CONTINUES TO BE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ONE A THREE. I AM A FATHER ARMY VETERAN BOY SCOUT LEADER. AND A GUN OWNER. I'VE GROWN UP AROUND GUNS FROM A YOUNG AGE I'VE RECEIVED AND PROVIDED FIREARM SAFETY TRAINING. I NEVER GO SHOOTING WITH SOMEONE. UNLESS I KNOW THEY KNOW HOW TO HANDLE A WEAPON. I RECENTLY TOOK MY KIDS OUT TO THE SPENCERVILLE FIRING RANGE ON BLM LAND NOW OUT NEAR SMARTS WILL. THERE WAS A YOUNG LADY WITH HER BOYFRIEND SHOOTING ASSAULT STYLE WEAPONS A CLAY PIGEONS. I'M MORE THAN ONE OCCASION SHE SWUNG THE MUZZLE. TOWARDS US AND OTHER SHOOTERS. SHE DID NOT REGULARLY PUT THE WEAPON ON SAFE AND HAS OBVIOUSLY NOT PREPARED TO HANDLE THAT WEAPON. WE GOT THE HECK OUT OF THERE FAST. JUST IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A SMALL HANDGUN. LOCKED AND LOADED READY TO GO CONCEALED CARRIED BY SOMEONE WHO HASN'T DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO SAFELY HANDLE A GUN. ONLY THAT THEY CAN PAY A FEE AND ANSWERS OF QUESTIONS AND THEN SHOVES IT IN THE OTHER POCKET THEIR PURSE THEIR BACKPACK THEIR GLOVE COMPARTMENT. WHAT CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION REQUIRING BACKGROUND CHECKS BEFORE BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE A FIREARM AND ALSO REQUIRE SAFETY CLASSES BEFORE PERSON CAN CARRY A GUN IN PUBLIC? THERE IS NO PROOF OF PRACTICE REQUIRED. THANKFULLY MOSHARRAF CYBER PRACTICE OF REQUIRING A PERSON TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN SAFELY HANDLE LOAD DISCHARGE CLEAR AND RETURN A WEAPON TO SAFE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A UNIFORM REQUIREMENT ACROSS THE STATE. IF WE'RE GOING. TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE NATION IN GOOD COMMON SENSE APPROACHES TO GUN SAFETY WE MUST REQUIRE POTENTIAL COULD SEE CONCEALED CARRY OWNERS. PROVE THAT THEY CAN OPERATE A FIREARM SAFELY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PAYMENT ORGANIZATION ONLY PLEASE.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND READ HERE ON BEHALF THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION. WE'RE HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY. WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL IS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH FOR PROBLEM. CCW HOLDERS ACROSS THE NATION AND IN CALIFORNIA OR SOME THE MOST LAW ABIDING CITIZENS OUT THERE. AND TAKE. CARRYING A FIREARM VERY SERIOUSLY WE HAVE SOME VERY STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA REGARDS TO TRAINING. I'M CURRENTLY A PERSON WHO WISHES TO OBTAIN CCW A MASCOT THEIR EXTENSIVE PROCESS THAT INCLUDES. TRAINING THAT IS ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT TO SIXTEEN HOURS THAT IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE. AND. THE FOLKS TODAY'S OBVIOUSLY ON LIVE FIRE IN MOSHE ARENS DO REQUIRE LIVE FIRE. OR SPECIFIC TRAINERS AND IT'S GONNA GO INTO THEIR CHORUS CREEK CURRICULUM. WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO REQUIRE IT BUT WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN A CLASSROOM FOR SIXTEEN HOURS. THERE'S A LOT OF MATERIALS THAT ARE COVERED ARE WERE UNAWARE OF ANY ANY PROBLEMS WITH LACK OF TRAINING CURRENTLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TIME ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION IN THE REQUIREMENTS IS EVERY TWO YEARS. PERSON WISHING TO RENEW THEIR PERMIT IT'S GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK. NOW DUE TO LACK OF TRAINING OR LACK A LIVE FIRE AND WE FEEL THIS IS SOLUTIONS ARE FOR PROM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRADLE IS ABOUT THE FIRES POLICY COALITION ALEKO THE THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE. A. REALLY AS WE'RE LOOKING FOR QUOTE UNQUOTE COMMON SENSE FIREARMS LEGISLATION. MIKE MY CONCERN IS ONCE AGAIN THE WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT SOLVE A PROBLEM AND I'VE YET. I'VE YOU HAVE YET TO HEAR ONE PERSON BRING UP ONE INCIDENT WHERE YOU WHERE A CCW HOLDERS. AYE HAS BEEN INVOLVED A IN IN WHERE'D WHERE'D LACK OFTRAINING OF A CCW HOLDER HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY INCIDENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SINCE. AS FAR AS I KNOW NINETEEN TWENTY THREE WHEN CCW FOR FIRST STARTED STARTED BEING ISSUED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I I BELIEVE THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO LOOK TO SOLVE A PROBLEM WITH THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY UP PERHAPS WE ABIDING CITIZENS BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD ACTUALLY START. LOOKING AT OUR POLICIES RELATING TO A RELEASING THOSE FROM. FROM INCARCERATION WHO HAVE PROVEN TO BE VIOLENT OUR SOCIETIES WITH THAT THESE CONCERNS THAT WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST WONDERING I'M GONNA CALIFORNIA I KNOW THERE'S A VERY LONG LINE OUT THERE I MEAN SAM WAS SEPARATE AS WITH GUN OWNER IT WAS GOING TO BE HERE IN OPPOSITION AS WELL. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD MAKE IT AND HE IS A TRAINER. AND HAD SOME REALLY GOOD INSIDE AND I'M SURE HE ACT THAT NEWSLETTER SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE QUIRK. BOB I JUST LIKE TO MENTION THAT OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE PEOPLE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY CONCEALED CARRY. HOLDERS ARE ABOUT HALF OF THOSE BY SUICIDE I DO THINK THEY NEED MORE TRAINING. AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BELL. AND I'LL SECOND. I'VE. GOOD MISTER KILEY. I THINK U. SO I WAS RECORDED YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY. SHE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICES DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE SORT REQUIREMENTS NOW. SO WE HAVE. YOUR WHERE POLICE ONE COUNTY THAT EXPLICITLY REFERENCES NOT REQUIRING ANY SPECIFIC TRAINING THAT'S GLENN COUNTY. WERE ALSO IN TO HAMMER VENTURA AND SOLANO COUNTY THERE'S NO EXPLICIT MENTION OF REQUIRING LIVE FIRE TRAINING. TIME JUST APPROVED LIST OF TRAINERS OF SO THERE'S SOME DISPARITIES BETWEEN COUNTIES WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILLS ATTEMPTING TO RECTIFY. I SAY I'M IN CLASS BECAUSE OF THE OPPOSITION IF. IF SOMEONE WANTS TO RETURN. JUST TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND SO IF THIS IS SORT OF ALREADY REFLECTIVE OF EXISTING PRACTICE YOU SEE ANY. PARTICULAR HARM. FROM HAVING THE STATE. COME IN AND AND REGULATE THIS MORE IF IT IS MERELY REFLECTING EXISTING PRACTICE. MISTER CHAIRMAN THROUGH YOU TO MISTER KILEY A COULD YOU REPEAT YOUR QUESTION PLEASE YES SO I THINK IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAID THAT THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW MORE AWESOME LINE WITH WHAT I. YOU KNOW I SEE CW COURSES ALREADY INTEL I DID YOU SEE ANY ACTIVE HARM FROM THE STATE COMING IN IN REGULATING AND AWAY THAT RT REFLECTS. EXISTING PRACTICE. MISTER CHAIRMAN THROUGH YOU TO MISTER KILEY. READ RIGHT NOW THAT WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS A PRESUMPTION THAT THIS IS THE ONLY TRAINING THAT SOMEONE. WHO'S GETTING A CCW MIGHT TAKE. OR EVEN IT ANY HANDLING AND MOST CCW HOLDERS THAT I KNOW. TO DATE THEY TAKE OTHER COURSES THERE. REGULARLY OUT FIRING RANGE EXCITER. AND AGAIN. THERE'S. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WE HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS SOME STATES. HAVE EVERYTHING FROM PERMIT WAS CARRY. OTHER STATES WITH PERMITS. DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC MENTION OR SPECIFIC MINIMUMS WHEN IT COMES TO A. TO THE SPECIFIC TRAINING. WHETHER IT INVOLVES. LEGAL ASPECTS OR OR CERTAIN COURSES A PIRATE CETERA. AND SO. WE JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE HAVE NOT BEEN PRESENTED WITH ANY EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS AN EXISTING PROBLEM. AND SO THAT SEACM A PROPOSITION I SEE A SET OF GOD AND. TIED TO THE A TO THE MEMBERS TO THE THROUGH THE CHAIR. YEAH I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT I UNDERSTAND THAT OUT ONE BECAUSE THERE IS NO THERE IS NO REAL PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE IS. A WHEN HAS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR THIS BODY NOT SOUGHT TO ONCE IT STARTS REGULATING TO INCREASE THAT REGULATION TO CHANGE THAT REGULATION AND THE ONE THING THAT WE'VE SEEN COMING IN PARTICULAR FROM THIS BODY IS THE FACT THAT. THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM REGULATING US SOMETHING WITH WHICH THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OR UNDERSTANDING. AND THAT THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE REGULATIONS EVENTUALLY PUT IN PLACE A THAT HAVE NO BEARING IN REALITY OR UNDERSTANDING OF. A OF CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS OR OF FIREARMS OR THE FIREARM INDUSTRY OR CULTURE. A. I AND UNFORTUNATELY I WOULD NORMALLY I WOULD NOT DESCRIBE MAIENSCHEIN WE'RE NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE SLIPPERY SLOPE THEORY BUT I THINK THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS PROOF POSITIVE WHEN IT COMES TO FIREARMS THAT THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE. OKAY THANK YOU SO MISTER ARE GONNA HOW YOU RESPOND TO SORT OF THAT THAT THE POINT OF HEARING IS A SOLUTION. SEARCH OF A PROBLEM I MEAN THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME CONSENSUS THAT THIS MORE LAST REFLECTS EXISTING PRACTICE MAYBE THERE'S SOME COUNTY BID ON SOME OF THE ROLE OF RELIGION. PROBLEMS THERE I I DO THINK THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS KIND ON YOU. TO SHOWED EVIDENCE THAT. WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS A NEW LAW WILL? CHANGE EXISTING PRACTICES IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY IMPROVES GUN SAFETY SO WHAT'S YOUR EVIDENCE THAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN. OF. THE EVENING NEWS EVERY DAY MISTER KILEY THAT EVERY NEWSPAPER. WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING IN MARYLAND I MEAN FOR SOMEONE TO SIT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND SUGGESTED THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY WITH GUNS? THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION NOW WITH REGARD TO THIS SPECIFIC PIECE OF LEGISLATION MISTER KILEY WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT COUNTIES WITH DIFFERENT WAYS OF OPERATING. AND IT WAS SUGGESTED PERHAPS ADVOCATES OF THIS BILL HAVE NO. EXPERTISE SIR. EXPERIENCE WITH GUNS I WAS ON THE RIGHT FOOTING A. IN WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I WE WENT EXTENSIVE TRAINING A BEFORE WE WERE ALLOWED TO BE ON. THE FIRING RANGE. AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS NOT TO SAY THE CASE IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IN SO I MUCH LIKE WE HAVE AS A BODY CHOSEN TO REGULATE. THE USE OF A VEHICLES ON OUR STREETS WHICH ARE DEADLY WEAPONS SO IS A CONCEALED LOADED GUN IN PUBLIC AND SO WE SHOULD ESTABLISH A MINIMUM TRAINING REQUIREMENT THERE IS CURRENTLY A MAXIMUM. THERE IS NO MINIMUM AND WE CAN DO THAT. AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S NOT JUST HIS BODY AT THE TIME TO DEREGULATE THIS AS YOU WELL KNOW MISTER KILEY THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED ADDITIONAL GUNS SAFETY LEGISLATION. IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION SO IT ISN'T JUST US THAT'S DOING THIS WERE RESPONDING TO THE WHAT THE WILL AND DESIRES OF THE VOTERS CALIFORNIA. THANK OKAY I THINK I'M AT THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THERE DOES NEED TO BE SOME SORT OF TRAINING THAT GOES INTO IT THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THAT GOING TO ENTAIL AND SO. THAT MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT WE'D HAVE SOME REASON FOR THE PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS WE'RE GONNA SET FORTH IN STATURE RATHER THAN JUST SAYING THAT THESE. YES SOME PRETTY GOOD SO DO YOU YOU KNOW IS HAS THERE AT IS THIS EVEN STUDIED AND SHOWN A CAVE YOU HAVE THESE REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE THEN THERE'LL BE A. AN INCREASE IN GUN SAFETY. THIS PARTICULAR BILL WAS CRAFTED WITH LOOKING AT THE BEST PRACTICES OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED TRAINING PROGRAMS AND AND HAVE WORKED WITH THEIR WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES TO ESTABLISH THAT I THINK WHAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD AGAIN IS REFLECTIVE OF WHAT MANY COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY DO. I WEAR ESTABLISHING THE FLOOR FOR WHICH ALL COUNTIES HAVE TO OPERATE ON NOT JUST THE ONES THAT I THINK ARE GOOD ACTORS IN TRYING TO ENGAGE IN THIS IN A SENSIBLE WAY. OKAY AND INSIDE IS MY LAST QUESTION AND I STILL HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN ANY EVIDENCE LINKING THESE BIGGER PRACTICES THEN PROVE GOOD GUN SAFETY IS THERE ANY. PLACE I COULD FIND THAT SOMETIMES FOLKS ARE ENCOURAGED NOT TO SEE WHAT'S BEFORE THEIR OWN EYES AND WHAT WE HAVE IS A GUN SAFETY CHALLENGE IN THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO CARRY A LOADED WEAPON IN PUBLIC. THE SHOULD HAVE SOME TRAINING WITH WITH REGARD TO THAT AYE THEA THINK WE SPECIFICALLY ASKING IS CAN WE PROVE IN THE COUNTIES WHERE A% MINIMUM STANDARD HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THOSE COUNTY SOMEHOW HAVE FEWER OF GUN VIOLENCE SUCH. SITUATIONS. AYE WE CAN WORK ON THAT MISTER KILEY AS YOU WELL KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL I IMAGINE WE'RE GOING TO A LOT OF WORK RESPOND A LOT OF MEMBERS OF QUESTIONS. WILL WORK ON THAT AND I THINK THAT THE SHERIFF'S IN THOSE LOCAL OFFICIALS ESTABLISH THOSE THOSE MINIMUMS BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WAS WHAT WAS. WOULD IMPROVE SAFETY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND I I'M A STAND WITH THE SHERIFF'S AYE IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS WITH REGARD TO THAT. THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU. MISTER QUIRK JUST TO ANSWER% MISTER KYLIE'S QUESTION. IF YOU LOOK AT CALIFORNIA VERSUS FLORIDA PLACE ONE PLACE WITH STRICT GUN CONTROLS ONE WITH NOT. WHAT YOU SEE IN FLORIDA AND PARTICULAR IS MORE UNINTENTIONAL CHILDREN? BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN TRAINED ARE WE WHICH A PREDOMINANTLY IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE TRAINED AND I THINK THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THAT HELPS. EVEN IF IT'S NOT EVERY COUNTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I MISTER. GLORIA I WAS JUST WHAT CLOSING TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO MY COLLEAGUES A QUESTION IN WISCONSIN SINCE MANDATORY A HONEY SAFETY TRAINING COURSES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED THERE HAS BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN FATAL AND NONFATAL INCIDENTS. DURING THE STATE'S ANNUAL DEER HUNTING SEASON MAYBE APPLES AND ORANGES BUT SINCE THE TRAINING CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE FATALITY. OF THE USE OF THESE WEAPONS I WILL GET YOU SOME MORE INFORMATION EVERY MEMBER THIS COMMITTEE I SHOULD BE FULL INFORMED IN THE DECISION MAKING IT THEY HAVE. BY THINK COMMON SENSE INTUITION SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA BE ALLOWED TO GO ON PUBLIC WITH A LOADED GUN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO APPROVED PROFICIENCY AND ALIVE OUR SITUATION. IT'S COMMON SENSE IT IS WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT ASK WHEN IVA. THANK YOU AND DUBBED. IF YOU NOTICED THIS. JUST DISCUSSION. REALLY KIND OF INTERESTING. I I HAVE A. FIFTEEN YEAR OLD WILL SOON BE SIXTY. WHO'LL. BE TAKING DRIVER TRAINING. AND DRIVER EDUCATION. AND I'VE I'VE I'M SOLD AYE GALWAY BACK TO AND WE HAD SOME LEADERS. FOR IT FOR DRIVING OUT OF THEY HAVE NOW. BUT BEATEN MISTER GLORIOUS LOOKING AT ME LIKE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. FOR THOSE OF US WHO DO KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT TAUGHT YOU ADDRESS. AND YOU WANT TO EXTENSIVE TRAINING. ON THE RULES OF THE ROAD. AND WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT. ACROSS THE BOARD NON HERE WHEN IT COMES TO GUNS SAFETY. AYE AYE. I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE. WE DO NEED TO HAVE BETTER A BASELINE OF WHAT EVERY. ONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA ON NEEDS TO OF. TO DO COME UP TO. WHETHER NOT THAT MUNICIPALITY WANNA TAKE IT UP ANOTHER NOTCH REVIEW MORE ACCEPTED LOCAL MUNICIPALITY BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT ACROSS STATE LINES WE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE. A MINIMAL. SET OF REQUIREMENTS INSTRUCTED MENU ON THAT AND AND AND AND. BECAUSE I'M IN OBSTINATE ES DE. THAT WE GO AHEAD AND MOVE LISTEN AND. THEN APPROVE THIS. ARE MORE SOBERING. THERE'S. THIS NOTION OF WAITING. FOR A PROBLEM. TO HAPPEN I'M I DON'T PRESCRIBE THAT. I DON'T NEED TO SEE. BODIES. LINED UP IN THE HALLWAY. BEFORE I DO SOMETHING TO PREVENT THAT. I DON'T THINK THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO SEE. FAMILIES TORN APART BECAUSE. SOMEONE. ON USES. GUNS IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY BECAUSE THEY GET THEY LACK OF TRAINING. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO SEE THAT CARNAGE BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK IT'S IT'S BEST THAT WE HAVE A LEGISLATURE THAT WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT. DENTIST DE. THE FORETHOUGHT TO THINK AHEAD OF THIS. AND TRY TO PREVENT IT. AS OUR EVEN. YOU SOME MISTER COLLEAGUES WORD. HOPE I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH GOING AHEAD AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TRAINING. SO I'M RECOMMENDED WE HAVE AYE VOTE. THE BIG PROBLEM OF CONSECUTIVE. AB TWENTY ONE MAIENSCHEIN THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER ITEMS ARE AYE LACKEY. CDVA CDVA I GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY.

NO LESS THAN ONE HALF OF THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SET BY THE BOARD FOR COUNSELING SERVICES PROVIDED BY A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER WHICH IS ABOUT FORTY ONE DOLLARS A FORTY DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS. IT. WOULD ALSO EXPAND THE POOL OF ELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS TO INCLUDE THOSE THEY MAY BE ON PROBATION PAROLE POST LEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OR MANDATORY SUPERVISION IF THEY'RE VICTIMS OF COURSE. AND IN THE DISCRETION OF. THE CABBIE CPM AND THEN FINALLY THE BILL WE AUTHORIZES THE VIOLENCE PER COUNTY PROVISIONS. I WHICH IS SET TO EXPIRE IN TWENTY NINETEEN.

HAVEN'T COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON BE THERE TO SUPPORT OF ME AND ACTUALLY EXPLAIN WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH. LIKE OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AFFECTS THE FEAR THE PARANOIA THE ON. THE BEING HAVEN'T WALKED THROUGH THAT SAME. SPOT WHERE THAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE MY HOUSE. HOME I HAVEN'T FLOWN. SO. THERE'S PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT AND SUPPORTED ME AND PEOPLE WHO ARE. LIKE YOU THE LIVE LIKE CURRIE'S OWN THAT CAME OUT AND OFFER MENTORSHIP TO ME. THAT THAT CAME TO VISIT ME AT THE HOSPITAL. THAT HOME BASICALLY ON. EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHAT WHAT THIS ALONE ON PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS AND HOME OF THAT KIND OF TRAUMA HAD HIM ON MY BODY. AND BE ABLE TO OWN SO THE. YEAH START THE HEALING JOURNEY AND ON. YES SO SO WERE. WELL WHY WILL LOW'S ABLE TO COME OUT WAS ON BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THOSE EMOTIONS INSTEAD OF HIDING ON THE SET OF MASK IN THEM SUBSTANCE ABUSE THROUGH. A LOT OF ON DIFFERENT NEGATIVE ON OUTLETS I WAS ABLE TO OWN. SO I UNDERSTAND AND AND BASICALLY MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE AND RIGHT NOW I CURRENTLY WORK AS A HOME. MENTOR FOR THE YOUNG FOLKS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE SAME ISSUES THAT I DEAL WITH SO I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU WE DID EXTREMELY WELL SIR. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MIKE MAKE LIVELY I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT GIFFORD'S LA CENTER AND I DIRECTOR URBAN GUN VIOLENCE INITIATIVE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING THIS MORNING THIS TIME IN MARYLAND AND THIS IS A TOPIC THAT I THINK IS ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS WHAT CAN WE DO. AS A COUNTRY WHAT CAN YOU DO AS LEGISLATORS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THIS EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY AND TO OUR STATE'S CREDIT WE DO HAVE SOME OF THE STRONGEST. GUN LAWS IN THE COUNTRY. BUT WHAT WE STILL NEED TO DO IS IDENTIFY AND SCALE OUT EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT REALLY GET AT THE ROOT. OF GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR STATE AND HOSPITAL BASED BALLOTS INTERVENTION PROGRAMS ARE ONE OF THOSE SOLUTIONS THAT REALLY DESERVE OUR SUPPORT. AYE CALIFORNIA STILL HAS DESPITE ITS GUN LAWS STILL HAS MORE THAN A THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE KILLED BY GUN RELATED HOMICIDE EACH YEAR. AND OVER FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE SHOT NON FATALLY IN THE STATE SO WE STILL HAVE AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM WITH GUN VIOLENCE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. THIS STRATEGY IS SO EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING INJURY RECIDIVISM BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SHOT AT A VERY HIGH RISK OF BEING SHOT AGAIN AND OUR HOSPITALS HAVE ESSENTIALLY BECOME REVOLVING DOORS. WHERE PEOPLE WITH A GUNSHOT INJURY RECEIVE ACTS LIKE CARE AND TREATMENT BUT ARE THEN RELEASED BACK INTO THE SAME EXACT SITUATION THAT GOT THEM THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? AND SO HOSPITAL WE FOUND THAT INVENTION PROGRAMS REALLY USE THAT TEACHABLE MOMENT WHERE SOMEONE HAS BEEN BADLY INJURED AND THEY'RE READY TO HEAR MESSAGE OF CHANGE THEY'RE READY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ROOT CAUSES. THAT LED TO THE INJURY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SOME OF THE VERY HEROIC. PEER VIOLENCE COUNSELORS THAT ARE EMPLOYED BY EACH VIP'S HAVE HELPED TO REDUCE YOUR SENTIMENT RECIDIVISM RATES OF INJURY AND CRIME IN CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO. AND. I IN THE IN THE HANDFUL OF PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS OUR STATE WE'VE SEEN STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW EFFECTIVE THESE PROGRAMS ARE. SO AB TWENTY ONE HUNDRED IS THE COMMON SENSE AND REALLY A MODEST PROPOSAL TO HELP USE VICTIM COMPENSATION DOLLARS TO REIMBURSE THEM THEIR PEER VIOLENCE COUNSELORS. THAT ARE PROVIDING THIS VERY CRITICAL SERVICE WHERE THEY'RE CONNECTING WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN SHOT WORKING WITH THEM AFTER THEY'VE BEEN DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL TO HELP IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSES LIKE. LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. GANG MEMBERSHIP WHATEVER IT IS THAT MIGHT HAVE LED SOMEONE TO BE SHOT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO THIS IS SUCH AN EFFECTIVE POLICY THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF AIDS VIP'S IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ADDRESS OUR GUN VIOLENCE PROBLEM WE NEED MANY MORE OF THESE PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND AB TWENTY ONE HUNDRED IS ONE WAY TO HELP ENCOURAGE. THESE PROGRAMS TO EXPAND AND GROW BY PROVIDING MODEST REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE FOLKS THAT ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES ON THE GROUND AND WE THINK IT DIFFERENCE LAS AND OUR. THAT EMBRACING THE STRATEGY AT THE STATE LEVEL EYES AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THE URBAN GOT ABOUT THAT REALLY DRIVES THE MAJORITY OF SHOOTINGS THAT WE SEE. IN OUR STATE SO WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU. OR ANY OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAME AN ORGANIZATION.

AND ONE I THINK. A CHAIR AND STUFF FOR THE HELP THAT YOU PROVIDED ON THIS MEASURE AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE WHO FEAR COMMITTING SUICIDE TO VOLUNTARILY AND. CONFIDENTIALLY ADD THEIR OWN NAME TO A CALIFORNIA DO NOT SELL LIST TO PREVENT THEMSELVES FROM PURCHASING. A FIREARM SUICIDE HAS SURPASSED. HOMICIDES AS THE MOST PREVALENT CAUSE OF DEATH RESULTING FROM THE MIS USE OF A FIREARM DESPITE A TEN DAY. WAITING PERIOD A STUDY FOUND THAT CAL THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE FIFTY SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT. SUICIDE IN THE FIRST WEEK AFTER PURCHASING A FIREARM FIREARMS ARE ALSO. AT THE MOST LETHAL AND MOST COMMON METHOD OF SUICIDE MORE PEOPLE WHO DIE BY SUICIDE USE A FIREARM THAT ALL OTHER METHODS COMBINED ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS WITH A FIREARM AND IN DEATH AS COMPARED TO FIVE PERCENT ONLY FOR OTHER OF METHODS OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS WE KNOW THAT. SUICIDE CAN BE AN IMPULSIVE DECISION PEOPLE USUALLY MAKE A DECISION TO KILL THEMSELVES AN ATTEMPT TAKE THEIR LIFE. IN LESS THAN A DAY. NINETY PERCENT OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE A SUICIDE ATTEMPT DO NOT GO ON TO DIE BY SUICIDE HOWEVER SUICIDE ATTEMPTS WITH A FIREARM. REALLY AFFORD A SECOND CHANCE THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW PEOPLE. AT RISK FOR SUICIDE HAVE THE OPTION TO PREVENT THEMSELVES FROM BUYING A FIREARM DURING A TIME WHEN THEY FEAR. THEY CAN HARM THEMSELVES SPECIFICALLY AB NINETY TWENTY SEVEN. WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO DEVELOP AND LAUNCH A SECURE INTERNET BASED PLATFORM TO ENABLE A PERSON TO VOLUNTARILY CONFIDENTIALLY AT THEIR NAME. TO THE DO NOT SELL LIST. THAT WILL PREVENT THEM FOR PURCHASING A FIREARM. THEY CAN REMOVE THEIR NAME AT ANY TIME UPON REQUEST AFTER YEAR. AND AND PRIOR TO YEAR THEY CAN REMOVE THEIR NAME WITH THAT SUPPORT OF DECLARATION FROM A LICENSED PHYSICIAN OR PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST INDICATING THAT THE NOT. A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. CALIFORNIA HAS ENACTED MANY OF THE STRONGEST. A. LAWS TO ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE AND BUT WE HAVEN'T YET. TAKEN ON THIS UNIQUE ISSUE THIS UNIQUE SPACE WHICH CAN REALLY SAVE A LOT OF LIVES WHICH IT WILL HELP RESTRICT INDIVIDUALS ABILITY SELF RESPECT INDIVIDUALS ABILITY TO PURCHASE. THEIR OWN FIREARM WE'RE NOT ALONE IN THIS EFFORT TO IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY APPROACH FIVE OTHER STATES ARE MOVING SIMILAR BILLS RIGHT NOW. AND STATE OF WASHINGTON THERE'S A BILL THAT SOMEONE TO OURS ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AWAITING THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE. AND AS THIS BILL MOVES ALONG A PLAN TO. DO ADDITIONAL WORK IF. BAH I'M ABLE TO MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE ON TO THE NEXT STEP. I REGARDING IDENTITY VERIFICATION. INTO THE ALSO INCLUDE A PENALTY FOR FALSELY SIGNING SOMEONE ELSE UP FOR INCLUSION ON THE LIST ANOTHER THAT'S BEEN RAISED AS AN ISSUE WE WANT TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST MEASURES TO PREVENT SUCH A THING FROM HAPPENING. WITH AB NAKED TWENTY SEVEN WE CAN GIVE INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF SUICIDE THE TOOLS TO BE PROACTIVE AND SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES. AND ARE WE WE KNOW THE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT A UP TO FORTY PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALSWITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WOULD SIGN UP FOR SUCH A LIST IF IT WERE OFFERED TO THEM. SO WE THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE USED ARAB IT IF IT WERE ABLE TO ENACTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IF IT SAVES ONE LIFE I THINK IT'S MORE THAN WORTH IT SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I HAVE WITH ME TWO WITNESSES I HAVE ANY ERRORS PROFESSOR AT YALE LAW SCHOOL WHO HELPED DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL IN THIS CONCEPT. ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT IS AMANDA WILCOX REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT. GUN VIOLENCE. GOOD MORNING THAT MY NAME IS IAN HEIRESS AYE I'M THE WILLIAM TOWNS AND PROFESSOR AT YALE LAW SCHOOL. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN AB NINETEEN TO TWENTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA COULD TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY ON SENSIBLE. GUN REGULATION. ALTHOUGH MASS SHOOTINGS GRAB THE HEADLINES GUN SUICIDE CLAIMS MANY MANY MORE LIVES. THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER KILLED FIFTY EIGHT PEOPLE GUN SUICIDE KILLS THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE EVERY DAY. AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE WHO FEAR SUICIDE PUT DISTANCE BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND FIREARMS. THE BILL IN EFFECT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO OPT INTO A LONGER WAITING PERIOD. THE CURRENT WAITING PERIOD IS NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT MANY SUICIDES. JOE'S OF BREMEN WAITED THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED DELAY PERIOD FOR DELIVERY OF A A NEW HANDGUN IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THE THREE DAYS LATER THAT I SHOT HIMSELF BUT I AS REPORTED IN THE LA TIMES BREMEN WAS SITTING IN THE BEDROOM OF HIS. OAKLAND HOME WITH HIS WIFE MICHELLE WHO'S BLIND THE COUPLE WERE. MAKINGOUT A GROCERY SHOPPING LIST IN BREMEN WHO HAD JUST TAKEN A SHOWER GOT UP AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM. MICHELLE BREMEN HEARD WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS THE WAS A CAR BACKFIRE THEN SHE HEARD WHAT SATELLITE WATER SPLASHING AGAINST THE SHOWER CURTAIN AND WONDERED WHY. BREMEN WITH WAS BATHING AGAIN. AND THEN I THOUGHT I SMELLED GUNPOWDER SHE SAID I SCREAM FOR HIM AND I RAN INTO THE BATHROOM. BRAIN WAS SLUMPED OVER THE BATHTUB IS BLOOD FROM HIS HEAD SPRAYED AGAINST THE SHOWER CURTAIN. JOSEPH BREMEN IS NOT ALONE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA KILL THEMSELVES EACH YEAR. AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN PROVIDES MUCH MORE PROTECTION. THEN. A WAITING PERIOD DURING THE FIRST YEAR AFTER SIGNING UP A PERSON CAN PURCHASE A GUN ONLY IF THEY SUBMIT A DECLARATION FROM A PHYSICIAN OR PSYCHOLOGIST. ATTESTING THAT THE PARTICIPANT IS NOT PRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF HARM. TO SELF OR OTHERS WITH A FIREARM. THERE GOOD REASON TO THINK THIS ADDED LAYER PROTECTION WILL PREVENT MANY SUICIDES. THE GREAT VIRTUE OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT'S COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY NO ONE IS AFFECTED TOO DOESN'T WANT TO BE. BUT A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM IS IT IS EFFECTIVE OF COURSE ONLY IF PEOPLE VOLUNTEER WHAT'S WHAT IF CALIFORNIA PASSES THE BILL BUT NO ONE SIGNS UP. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND I I KNOW THIS FOR PERSONAL AS WELL AS EMPIRICAL REASONS. MY COAUTHOR FRED VARS AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN TWO DIFFERENT STUDIES SHOWING THAT MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES. WOULD BE WILLING TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO PURCHASE GUNS. ONE STUDY OF PEOPLE SEEKING PSYCHIATRIC CARE AT A MAJOR MEDICAL CENTER FOUND THAT FORTY SIX PERCENT WOULD RESTRICT THEIR FUTURE GUN PURCHASES IN THIS WAY. A MORE RECENT STUDY OF INTERNET USERS FOUND THAT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE GENERAL POPULATION AND FORTY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED. WITH AMENTAL DISORDER WOULD BE WILLING TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE OR POSSESS GUNS. THE DEMAND FOR THIS KIND OF VOLUNTARY WAIVER ISN'T ABSTRACT MY CO AUTHOR ON THIS STUDY. FRED VARS HAS BIPOLAR DISORDER AND HAS AT TIMES IN THE PAST BEEN SUICIDAL FRED CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF A WAIVER REGISTRY. BECAUSE HE REALIZED THAT HE IT COULD HELP HIM SAVE HIS OWN LIFE. FIFTEEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER DIED BY SUICIDE IF FRED HAD HAD EASY ACCESS TO A GUN AT CERTAIN POINTS IN HIS LIFE HE'D ALREADY BE ONE OF THEM. PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN SEVERELY DEPRESSED CAN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE YOU LOSE JOY YOU LOSE HOPE. AND YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO MAKE RATIONAL DECISIONS. HOWEVER LIKE ALMOST ALL PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS FRED HAS PERIODS OF CLARITY DURING THESE THESE PERIODS HE WANTS TO PROTECT HIMSELF AGAINST FUTURE DARK DAYS. TWO MONTHS AGO THE PARKLAND MASSACRE A BILL FOR TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE PARKLAND MASSACRE. SHOOTER HIMSELF NICOLAS CREWS CALLED NINE ONE ONE AND TOLD THE DISPATCHER THAT HE QUOTE KIND OF GOT MAD AND STARTED PUNCHING WALLS. CRUISES CALL TO NINE ONE ONE WAS A LITERAL CRY FOR HELP IF THE DISPATCHER HAD ALERTED HIM TO AN OPTION. TO TEMPORARILY WAIVE HIS RIGHT TO PURCHASE AND POSSESS FIREARMS KEY LIKE HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE IN OUR STUDIES MIGHT HAVE VOLUNTARILY DISARMED. THERE'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THERE COULD YOU WRAP IT UP BEYOND USING UP ALL THE FIVE MINUTES AND I'M SORRY IN THE BRADY CAMPAIGN I KNOW THEY WANT TO SPEAK SORRY. SO. THAT THE COST OF. THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF SUICIDE ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE PERSONAL AND EMOTIONAL COST I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PASS A BE NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU. I'LL I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF AGAIN AMANDA WILCOX HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. THIS BILL SUPPORTS ARE CALLED OUR CORE MISSION OF WHICH IS TO REDUCE FIREARM INJURY AND DEATH IN OUR NATION AS WELL AS IN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF FIREARM DEATHS NATIONALLY OR SUICIDE BY FIREARMS. AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE GUN DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA A BY SUICIDE AND SADLY THAT NUMBER IS GROWING PERHAPS BECAUSE GUN OWNERSHIP. AYE IS INCREASING SO CLEARLY TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR STATE WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF SUICIDE BY FIRE. MANY OF OUR LOST MANY OF WHICH I'VE WORKED ON AND YOU ALL HAVE SUPPORTED. A DEAL WITH THAT. OUR GOAL TO KEEP. FIRE ARMS OUT THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS AND DANGEROUS HANDS BUT CLEARLY WE NEED TO TRUST THE PROBLEM A SUICIDE BY FIREARM AND WE NEED EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO DO THAT AND THIS IS ONE OF THE TOOLS. I'M THE PRESIDENT OF OUR TWENTY CALIFORNIA BRADY CHAPTERS OUR. PEG MCCRAW MISS FROM LONG BEACH CHAPTER AND SHE VERY MUCH WANTED ME TO SHARE HER EXPERIENCE WHICH IS THAT HER DAUGHTER ARE EXCUSE ME HER SISTER SUFFERS FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. HER SISTER IS A KIND GENTLE SOUL BUT WHEN CHOOSING CRISIS SHE DOES THINGS THAT SHE WOULD NOT NORMALLY DO SHE'S NOT HERSELF. AND HER SISTER WOULD BE HORRIFIED IF SHE IN ANYWAY INJURED ANOTHER PERSON ARE OBVIOUSLY HERSELF A WHILE SHE'S IN HER CRISIS STATE. IN THE BILL OF THE TO SELF REFER TO A LESS. I DO NOT SELL LISTS WOULD NOT ONLY PUT HER SISTERS MINDED EAST BUT ALSO THE ENTIRE FAMILY. THE MY OWN PERSONAL STORIES I'M FROM A RURAL COUNTIES YOU KNOW NEVADA COUNTY ARE GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROBLEM IS SUICIDE BY FIREARM. ON MY DAUGHTER AS YOU KNOW WAS KILLED IN THE RAMPAGE SHOOTING BY AN INDIVIDUAL WITH MENTAL ILLNESS I ACTUALLY BELIEVE HE IS TRYING TO DO SUICIDE BY COP. OR MAYBE IN THE END TO SHOOT HIMSELF EATING GET THAT FAR BUT HE KILLED THREE OTHERS. SINCE THAT TIME I'VE BEEN ON THE SUICIDE PREVENTION TASKFORCE IN NEVADA COUNTY AND EVERYONE HAS EMBRACE ALL STAKEHOLDERS THE CONCEPT THAT MEANS MATTER HOW HE TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF. MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN WEATHER THAT SUICIDE IS COMPLETED AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SOMEONE TRY SOMETHING OTHER THAN A FIREARM. THAT SUICIDE MAY NOT BE COMPLETE IN THAT PERSON STILL ALIVE. ON AND THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PEOPLE WHO ATTEMPT SUICIDE. BUT DO NOT SUCCEED AND THEREFORE LIVE DO NAP LATER DIE BY SUICIDE BECAUSE WE OFTEN HEAR THEY DON'T HAVE A FIREARM THAT JUST TRY SOMETHING ELSE. APPOINTMENTS. BY SUPERVISOR AND BOTH ON THAT TASK FORCE I MENTIONED THE MENTAL HEALTH FOR WERE VERY FOCUSED ON. EMPOWERING CLIENTS OUGHT TO MAKE. GOOD DECISIONS REGARDING THEIR OWN SELF CARE TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN SAFETY PLANS AND TO. USED TO EMPOWER THEM TO USE THEIR OWN ACTIONS ARE TO MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER AND SAFER IN THIS IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH THAT PHILOSOPHY. THAT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN NEVADA COUNTY HAVE. FINALLY IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME FOR JUST A MOMENT I GET VERY UPSET WHEN I HEAR OVER AND OVER HALF THE SHOOTINGS AND I SEE IN THE AGAIN AND ANNOUNCES. THAT WERE SPOKE FOCUSED ON GUNS INSTEAD OF THE UNDERLINING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM. IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR OBVIOUSLY IT'S BOTH. RIGHT. MY HUSBAND I WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT PASSED GAVE A LOT PERSONAL MONEY TO IT TO GET MORE RESOURCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN CALIFORNIA. LAURA'S LAW WAS NAMED AFTER MY DAUGHTER AND THAT'S TO GET THOSE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS WITH NO INSIGHT. I INTO THE ILLNESS INTO TREATMENT THROUGH COURT ORDER I MENTIONED I'VE BEEN ON THE SUICIDE PREVENTION TASK FORCE AMONG THE MENTAL HEALTH BOARD WHERE WE DETERMINE OUR PRIORITIES. UNDERSTANDING AND WELTS NEEDING CAO OF IN NEVADA COUNTY AND HOLDING UP OUR OUR PROVIDERS IN OUR COUNTY ACCOUNTABLE. OR WORKSHEET HUTTON HEADS AND OBVIOUSLY WE DO THAT NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT ASPECT I DON'T THINK ANYONE AGREES BUT WHY WE DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES WHICH A VERY HARD IN COMPLICATED TERMS OF. MENTAL HEALTH CARE LESS IT'S STILL ONLY STOP THE BLEEDING BY REMOVING ACCESS TO FIREARMS BY THOSE WHO ARE AT RISK OF DANGER TO SELF OR OTHERS. THANK YOU I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. BUT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE A FAIRLY COME BEHALF OF DIFFERENT LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE CAN SUPPORT. OKAY VERY WELL WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. OF CHIU. ADDRESS THE WORKABILITY ISSUES TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORTHY GOALS THAT THAT THE BILL. AIMS FOR ON WITHOUT ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN THE FOR TO CONTINUE THAT DISCUSSION THANK YOU. OKAY YES. M. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THAT GOES CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CURRICULA ON BEHALF OF THE FIREARMS POLICY COALITION IN OPPOSITION. WE ARE YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO IN OUR CONCERNS ARE PRIMARILY REGARDS TO INDIVIDUALS BEING ADDED TO THE LIST TO AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE LIST. A ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH ANY INTERNET BASED GOVERNMENT DATABASE. THERE THERE ARE CONCERNS OF IDENTITY THEFT AND WE'RE IN AN AGE WHERE IDENTITY THEFT IS A HUGE ISSUE. A OUR OUR CONCERN IS THAT IN INDIVIDUALS SOMEONE MAY OBTAIN SOMEONE'S INFORMATION AND REGISTER THEM ON THE THIS ON THIS WEBSITE. AND WE KNOW THAT THIS HAPPENS ALREADY BECAUSE THERE ARE ALREADY EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE WHO GET ALL WHO WHO REGISTER TO VOTE ONLINE THAT ARE EXPLICITLY REGISTER TO VOTE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING TAX ID'S THAT ARE SUPPOSE TO BE ABLE TO GET TAX ID'S ARE PEOPLE APPLYING FOR TAX REFUNDS THERE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE GET TAX REFUNDS. A OUR CONCERN IS THAT. EYES IS FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT ONCE AGAIN GETTING ON THIS LIST AND THEY WANT IT GIVE PEACE PEOPLE MAY BE ADDED TO THIS LIST THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THIS LIST. OF OREGON IS OFFERED A MEASURES WERE ACTUALLY YOU GO INTO THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE AND YOU HAVE YOUR NAME ADDED TO THE LIST AND. AND THEN YOU'D GO IN THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE AND HAVE YOUR NAME REMOVED UP FROM THE LIST A DID THAT'S A. WE BELIEVE THAT IS A MUCH MORE AYE TENABLE INSUPPORTABLE POSITION. DANNY IS THAT IS HAVING ONE ONCE AGAIN INTERNET BASED WEBSITE THE OTHER CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS BY REPORTING THIS INFORMATION TEN NECKS. WHICH IS THE NATIONAL BASED SYSTEM OUT WHILE THE BILL SPECIFICALLY MAY SAY THAT YOU HAVE NOT CREATE YOU HAVE NOT COMMITTED A CRIME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT YOU MAY BE DOING BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE ADDED TO THE NEXT AT A BASE AND THEN IF YOU ATTEMPT A PURCHASE A FIREARM? YOU STILL REUS IS AS WE UNDERSTAND IT AND READ IT YOU STILL MAY HAVE COMMITTED A FEDERAL CRIME BY BEING PROHIBITED ATTEMPTING TO PURCHASE A FIREARM ONCE AGAIN NOTHING IN THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. OF THE OTHER CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS IS ONCE AGAIN WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT NEEDS TO BE REPORTED WHITE NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED IN NEXT ANYWAY UNLESS IS A CONCERN THAT AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO'S THINKING ABOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE IS GOING TO DRIVE ACROSS STATE LINES IN ORDER TO BE IN ORDER TO PURCHASE FIREMAN OF THE STATE WHICH BY THE WAY HAPPENS TO BE A CRIME. SO. ANYWAY THE FOR THESE REASONS ONCE AGAIN WE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT OF THE ISSUE THAT OF THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO ADDRESS A WE HAVE THESE THESE PRIMARY CONCERNS. I ENDO IS UNFORTUNATE THAT UNFORTUNATE WERE GONNA HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE AS IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED. THANK YOU. MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE RECORD DAN READ. AT THIS TIME WERE WERE IN OPPOSITION AYE ECHOED THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER TO LOSE HIS HAS. STATED HERE AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS. DONE HAS BROUGHT SOME AMENDMENTS AND IS WILLING TO WORK TO ADDRESS A PRIMARILY THAT THE PRIVACY CONCERNS IN THE VERIFICATION OF WHO IS ACTUALLY GOING INTO THIS DATABASE. AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE FURTHER PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH THE SAME OR SIMILAR NAMES OR DATE OF BIRTH ETCETERA. I'M ARE NOT INADVERTENTLY GETTING INTO THE SYSTEM. AND THEN AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT. AS MR LUCE MENTIONED WITH THE NEXT ISSUE. I KNOW THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT TALKS ABOUT REGULARLY UPDATING NEXT BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE EVENT THAT SOMEONE'S INADVERTENTLY PUT IN THERE THAT THEY ARE REMOVED SO THEY DON'T. A. THEY'RE NOT AT RISK OF COMMITTING A FEDERAL CRIME EXETER SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IN SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY WE'VE TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT I WANT TO INFORM THE COMMITTEE. THAT THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION LAST YEAR LAUNCHED ONE OF THE LARGEST NATIONWIDE AYE SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. WHERE THEY ARE TALKING TO? GUN RANGES GUN STORES. MANUFACTURERS ALL PEOPLE IN THE IN THE FIREARMS INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY. A PEOPLE WHO ARE POTENTIAL FOR SUICIDE AND TO. HELP GET THEM SOME HELP SO I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AS OF LAST YEAR. THE FIREARMS INDUSTRY IN THE FARMS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH SOME OF THE MAJOR ANTI SUICIDE GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. WHERE WE CAN HELP HIM AT THAT GUN RANGES IN THE GUN STORES AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG HELP? I I HOPE THAT IS HELPFUL TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN THE AUTHOR TO TO SEE THAT WE ARE NOT. FOR SUICIDE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY AGAINST. SO. SOME WOMEN QUIRK I'VE SEEN FIND THAT FUNNY. THANK MOVE THE BILL. BUT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THREE JAMS KILEY. I CITING THIS IS. I REALLY. CONSTRUCTIVE PROPOSAL AND I'M GLAD BUT AFFORD AN AYE AYE. AYE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR. ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF SUICIDE YES GUN RELATED SUICIDES WHICH PROBABLY DOES NOT GET ENOUGH ATTENTION. AFTER POLICYMAKERS PERHAPS BECAUSE TO TAKE A PHRASE FROM THE LAST PRESENTER YOU DON'T SEE AS MUCH ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS. AND I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO OUT TO WORK WITH THAT THE OPPOSITION AROUND THESE ISSUES OF A POTENTIAL FRAUD I AM I WOULD BE OKAY MISTER. A CHAIR TO ASK MR UP MISTER AYERS LE TO COME BACK AS A COUPLE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS. THE PROFESSOR AS HEIRS. SINCE THIS IS SORT OF ROOTED IN THE STYLE WATER YOU ARTICLE HE HAS HERE. WHICH IS WHICH IS AN INTERESTING ARTICLE AND I REALLY APPLAUD THE SORT OF FRESH AND ORIGINAL. IDEA I'D I NOTICED THAT IN YEARS MODEL A PROPOSAL WHAT'S A TWENTY ONE DAY. YOU CALL YOUR FOR THIS IS THE DURABILITY OF YOUR WAIVER AND DIE UNDER YOUR PROPOSAL. YOU CAN WAVE AT ANY TIME. AND THEN JUST TWENTY ONE DAYS LATER YOU. SORT OF. RESUME YOUR. ORDINARY SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS WHEREAS WITH THIS IT'S A YEARLONG. PROCESS UNLESS YOU GET THAT SORT OF POSITION ARE PSYCHIATRISTS KNOW WHICH I'M NOT SURE HOW. OFTEN THAT WOULD BE UTILIZED SO WHAT DO YOU WHY DID YOU MAKE THE CHOICE TO MAKE IT A TWENTY ONE DAY. PERIOD IN YOU KNOW WHILE YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE WAY THIS IS FORMED. WELL V. THE QUESTION OF HOW DURABLE. THE WAIVER. THAT I SHOULD BE IS. CAN DEPEND ON WHAT THE BACKGROUND RULES OF PARTICULAR STATES AND SO SAFE THAT DON'T HAVE A WAITING PERIOD AT ALL TO GO. THERE THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT. THAT GUN SUICIDE IS OFTEN IMPULSIVE AND IF YOU CAN GET PEOPLE THROUGH THAT PERIOD OF IMPULSE. YOU CAN SAVE A LOT OF LIVES AND THAT PERIOD OF IMPULSIVE VARIES IN LENGTH AND. AND GETTING THEM. IF IF THERE'S A STATE THAT HAS NO WAITING PERIOD. SEVEN DAYS WOULD SAVE SOME LIVES AND. THREE WEEKS WOULD SAVE SOME MORE LIVES AND A YEAR WOULD SAVE SOME MORE LIVE AND THERE IS A. AND SO ONE ONE VERY PRACTICAL QUESTION IS JUST. TAKING IN A PARTICULAR STATE WHERE IDEAS AND THINKING ABOUT. WHAT KIND OF AN EXTRA OPTIONS YOU'RE GOING TO GET INDIVIDUALS TO LENGTHEN THE WAITING PERIOD FROM WHAT IT CURRENTLY IS THAT'S A MANDATORY MATTER? RIGHT SO IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOUR PROPOSAL IS AS YOU AYE IN YOUR MODEL OR ADOPT IN CALIFORNIA. IT ACTUALLY WOULDN'T DO ALL THAT MUCH BECAUSE MOST OF THE BENEFITS RT CAPTURED UNDER EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TEN DAY WAITING HEARING YOU SAY HERE IN THE ARTICLE. A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE KINDLY TO SET UP A CENTRAL TO THE REGISTRANTS TO RESCIND THE WAIVER BECAUSE THEY WISH TO KILL THEMSELVES ACCORDINGLY ARE NOT LIKELY TO SEE IN THIS DESIRE OVER ENFORCED WAITING PERIOD. AND SO I. YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALREADY REALIZING A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSAL WOULD DO UNDER EXISTING LAW SO WHAT DO YOU ENVISION IS KIND OF THE THE MARGINAL BENEFIT. OF OF THIS BILL DOES PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE SUSTAINED IMPULSES BEYOND. A THREE WEEK PERIOD AND. AND THE THE PROPORTION THAT WOULD BE CAPTURED THAT YOU WOULD SAVE IN JET WITH JUST A THREE WEEK PERIOD VERSUS A YEAR PERIOD. THERE'S NOT STE GREAT SOCIAL SCIENCE TO DETERMINE OLD YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE. EXPERTS SENT IN LINE AND AND. AND THAT'S WHAT WHY PERCENT IN THE NEXT BUT THAT'S THE THE SENSES YES. THAT EVEN THAT TO GO FROM NO WAITING PERIOD TOOL WEEK. HAS BEEN ESTIMATED. FAIRLY ACCURATELY TO SAVE LIVES THERE'S JUST ISN'T AS MUCH SOCIAL SCIENCE ON THE MOVE FROM THREE WEEKS TO A YEAR RIGHT. YEAH SO THAT'S WHERE I'M KIND OF STRUGGLING WITH THIS IS THAT I YOU KNOW THIS IMAGE OF YOU WHAT'S THE SIDE TYING HIS HANDS TO THE MAST THAT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT YOUR. RATIONAL SELF AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME WILL. PURPOSELY RESTRAIN YOUR FUTURE SELF BUT WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE A WAITING PERIOD YOU'RE ACTUALLY DEALING WITH TO FUTURE SELVES RIGHT FUTURE SELF WOULD BY THE GUN. IN THE FUTURE SELF THAT TEN DAYS LATER WOULD THEN TAKE ACTION THAT'S HARMFUL THEMSELVES AND OTHERS WELL THAT THIS MIGHT HELP YOU THE BILL ALSO HAS THIS OPTION WHEN YOU REGISTER TO. LEAVE UP TO FIVE EMAILS AND THIS GOES. OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS A VERY PRACTICAL THING THAT THEY CAN DO. TO HELP HELP PEOPLE NOT JUST REGISTER BUT TO LEAVE. THEIR EMAIL ADDRESSES AND THAT GIVES A LOVED ONES OR MET. OR. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THEN A THREE WEEK PERIOD. TO. CONTACT THIS PERSON. AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR. TRYING TO RESCIND OR TRYING TO REGAIN THE RIGHT FOR. REASONABLE PERIOD BECAUSE AFTER YEAR YOU CAN'T RESCIND BUT. THREE WEEKS FOR THAT TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IF AFTER YOUR LONG CAREER THAT'S RIGHT AND AND THAT WOULD BE THREE WEEKS WORK ANY EMAIL RECIPIENT COULD CHECK IN TO MAKE SURE THAT. NONE OF THE WAITING PERIODS HAVE THIS EMAIL CHECK IN PERIOD OF THREE WEEKS WHICH COULD. THOUGHT YEAH DAVE LIVES THAT MISTER BONTA GERMANY SINCE THE COST OF SETTING UP THIS WHOLE THING I MEAN I'VE SEEN SIR REALLY MINOR TECHNOLOGIES THAT I COULD. ACCESS ON MY PHONE SUDDENLY BECOME MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS FOR THE STATE AND THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY. MASSIVE SYSTEM YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST. WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA TAKE KEEP COSTS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE WE THINK THIS IS OF THIS IS A SEPARATE LIST FROM. THE APPS LESS THAN AND SOME OF THE OTHER LESS FIFTY ONE FIFTY LISTED IT'S IT BUT TO DO NOT SALAS THE PISSED OFF ON VOLUNTARILY YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY GOVERNMENT HAS STRUGGLED IN THE PAST WITH THE AM SOME OF OUR DATABASES AND AND AND TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS BUT WORKING WITH DOJ NOW TO KEEP COSTS A MINIMAL. DON'T EXPECT THIS TO HAVE A. HIGH COST LIKE I CAN GIVE YOU WHAT IT IS WE HAVE HAD APPROPRIATIONS ANNOUNCES. ALRIGHT SO THAT'S WHERE I KIND AND I YOU KNOW THE THE. WITNESS FROM THE BRADY CAMPAIGN AYE I HEAR HER POINT THE YOU DON'T WANT TO. MAKE IT'S EITHER OR. BY I ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH I THINK PRETTY SPECULATIVE BENEFITS HERE GIVEN THE EXISTING WAITING PERIOD IN CALIFORNIA AND THE FACT THIS IS A YEAR LONG. WEAVER PUREED AS OPPOSED TO THE WASHINGTON BILLION REFERENCE WHICH I THINK WAS ONE WEEK. YOU DO NEED TO CONSIDER A CABLE TO SPEND FIVE MILLION OR TEN MILLION ON THIS. IS THAT IT IS THIS GOING TO SAVE MORE LIVES THAN SAVE HIRING MORE COUNSELORS AT THAT HIGH SCHOOLS WHO COULD ADDRESS UNDERLYING. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO THAT BE PART OF MY CONCERN WITH THIS I THINK. AND I I DO HAVE TO MENTION A APART THIS ARTICLE THAT I FOUND. A LITTLE TROUBLING AND IS THIS IDEA THAT. THIS COULD SOMEHOW. STILL TAPE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN SOME WAY AND THERE'S THIS I THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW FRIEND AND FAMILY DEMANDS TO KIND OF REGISTER WITH THE SYSTEM MAY BE A.

SANTIAGO AYE. OF. FRIEDMAN AB TWENTY TWO FORTY THREE. THANK YOU FOR WAITING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS IT WAS VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR US. AB TWENTY TWO FORTY THREE WOULD WORKERS WHO WANT TO REPORT A CRIME OF VIOLENCE PERPETRATED AGAINST THEM DURING AN ACT PROSTITUTION. OR WANT TO TESTIFY AS A WITNESS TO SUCH A CRIME. BY PROHIBITING EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY IN SUCH CASES WERE REASSURING ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN OUR STATE THAT THEY DESERVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS EVERY OTHER CALIFORNIAN. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS PROMOTED THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF OUR STATE BY ENCOURAGING EVERY VICTIM EVERY WITNESS TO COME FORWARD. HOWEVER SEX SEX WORKERS OFTEN AVOID REPORTING CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THEY FEAR BEING PROSECUTED FOR THEIR PROSTITUTION. AND A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO SAINT JAMES INFIRMARY RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF SEX WORKERS FACE SOME FORM OF ASSAULT WHILE ENGAGING IN SEX WORK. THIRTY TWO PERCENT REPORTED A PHYSICAL ASSAULT WHILE TWENTY NINE BEFORE FOR A REPORTED A SEXUAL ASSAULT. CURRENTLY MANY PROSECUTORS PROVIDED UNITY THE SEX WORKERS WHO ACT AS COOPERATING WITNESSES AB TWENTY TWO FORTY THREE WOULD SIMPLY CODIFIED THIS PRACTICE. WHICH IS COMMON. THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT TURNING ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN. CRAFTED SIMILAR POLICE POLICIES LAST YEAR AND A SEEM ENCOURAGING RESULTS. TESTIFYING TODAY IS MINISH KENDELL THE WOMEN'S POLICY DIRECTOR FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MEAN YOU SCANDAL I'M THE WOMEN'S POLICY DIRECTOR AT THAT DEPARTMENT THE STATUS OF WOMEN FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO I WANNA THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. IN THIS ERA OF ME TOO AND IT'S TIME AND WE SAID ENOUGH WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN IN ALL INDUSTRIES AND PROFESSIONS ARE PROVIDED A SAFE ROUTE AND SUPPORTED IN REPORTING SEXUAL. HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE AND SEX WORKERS ARE SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE VICTIMS SUBJECT TO EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AND ASSAULT. AND BECAUSE SEX WORK IS CRIMINALIZED ADDS AN EXTRA BARRIER FOR SEX WORKERS TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT BEING. ASSAULTED BECAUSE THEY MAY FEAR THAT THEY MAY BE ARRESTED. THIS BILL WAS INSPIRED BY A LOCAL POLICY AS WAS MENTIONED THAT WE DEVELOPED IN SAN FRANCISCO OUT OF OUR. MAYOR'S TASK FORCE ON AND A HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND IN COLLABORATION WITH SEX WORKER RIGHTS GROUPS AND ARE JUST RETURNEES OFFICE IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT WE IMPLEMENTED THIS POLICY LATE LAST YEAR AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN. THAT BENEFICIAL RESULTS I WAS RECENTLY TALKING TO AN INSPECTOR IN OUR SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SAN FRANCISCO. AND HE DESCRIBED A RECENT INCIDENT WHERE A SEX WORKER WAS BRUTALLY ASSAULTED AND STABBED ON A STREET IN THE MISSION NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAN FRANCISCO AND A NEIGHBOR HEARD HER SCREAMING AND WANTED TO CALL FOR. AND AMBULANCE AND SHE REALLY DIDN'T WANT HIM TO DO THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID SHE WAS GOING TO GET ARRESTED AND WHEN HE SAW HER BLEEDING HE INSISTED AND WHEN THE POLICE SHOWED UP AGAIN. SHE WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO TELL THEM. WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHO HAD DONE THIS TO HER IN PART BECAUSE SHE WAS BEING PROSECUTED IN ANOTHER COUNTY FOR PROSTITUTION AND THE OFFICERS LITERALLY TOLD HER ABOUT THIS POLICY AND EVENTUALLY WERE ABLE TO SHOW HER A WRITTEN COPY OF THE POLICY? AND IT GAVE HER COMFORT IN PROVIDING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WHICH LED TO THE ARREST OF. THE. THE PERPETRATOR SO. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN HOW HELPFUL IT CAN BE TO HAVE A POLICY LIKE THIS IN WRITING OR CODIFIED EVEN IF IT IS THE ACTUAL PRACTICE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO PRIORITIZE MORE SERIOUS CRIMES SO. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY TWO FORTY THREE WHICH PROVIDES A WAY FOR SEX WORKERS TO SAY ME TOO. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE ALICE KESSLER ON BEHALF OF A QUALITY CALIFORNIA ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING KATIE MILLER ON BEHALF OF SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY GEORGE GASTON STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MOVE THE BILL AND. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. IS THERE SECOND. THIS QUESTION ON THIS SO I'M. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ACTUALLY ARE QUITE A FEW TYPES OF LOW LEVEL CRIMES THAT MAY TEND TO. OCCUR A LOT AND THAT THE PRESENCE OF A HIGHER LEVEL CRIMES I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY'RE GENERALLY TOOLS A PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION TO. UNIFIED SOMEONE WITHOUT IMMUNITY IF THEY COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY FOR THE HIGHER CRIME SO AND THIS IS THE KIND OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH IN JUST THAT. TOTAL ACROSS THE BOARD BAR ON THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE IS THERE ANY PRECEDENT FOR THIS AND WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS AN APPROACH THAT IS NEEDED BEYOND KIND OF THE EXISTING TOOLS THAT PROSECUTORS HAVE. I CAN'T SPEAK AS TO WHETHER THERE'S A PRECEDENT BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE'VE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THE PROSECUTORS AND FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY DO EXPERIENCE TIMES WHERE SEX WORKERS ARE AFRAID TO. ON THE BE A WITNESS OR TO COME FORWARD ABOUT THEIR OWN VIOLENT CRIME BECAUSE IF YOU'RE PROSECUTION. SO WE DO KNOW THAT THAT IS A BARRIER TO REPORTING AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AT THE COMPELLING. CRIME THAT THEY WANT TO. PREVENT ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMMITTING VIOLENT ACTS IN AND. THAT'S THE YOU KNOW THE THE. PUBLIC BENEFIT IF THIS IS REALLY TO GET PEOPLE THAT ARE VIOLENT SEXUAL PREDATORS AND VIOLENT PREDATORS OFF THE STREETS AND IF THERE'S A BARRIER LIKE THIS THAT WE KNOW OF. I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMOVE THAT BARRIER. CAN I RESPOND BECAUSE ACTUALLY IS A PRECEDENT. IN THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING SPHERE THERE'S AN EVIDENTIARY EXCLUSION ABOUT EVIDENCE THAT SOMEONE THAT A HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIM WAS ENGAGED IN PROSTITUTION I'M CANNOT BE USED AGAINST THEM IF THE PROSTITUTION WAS A RESULT OF THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING SAID THERE IS I'M A. VERY SIMILAR PRESIDENT IS THAT A. IS AN EVIDENTIARY BAR DOES IT GO TO ASK WHETHER THE THE AN ELEMENT OF THE OFFENSE WHEN YOU HAVE IT AND IT'S IN THE EVIDENCE CODE. YEAH AND THEN ON TO GET YOUR POINT ABOUT DON'T PROSECUTORS ALREADY HAVE TOOLS IF PEOPLE ARE FREE TO REPORT IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WON'T EVEN GET TO THE PROSECUTOR'S DESK TO OFFER THAT IMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW WE SAW IN THE CASE. THAT I. GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF IF THE POLICE HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO REASSURE THAT PERSON AT THE TIME THEY WERE REPORTING ABOUT THIS IT NEVER WOULD HAVE EVEN MADE IT TO THE PROSECUTOR TO OFFER THAT KIND OF IMMUNITY SO WE RELEASED. SEE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IT EARLIER ON IN THE PROCESS TO BE SURE PEOPLE. KNOW IT BUT HELPFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. COLD OF. I JUST ONE MORE COMMENT. AGAIN I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE BILL AND BE AT BEING ADDED TO SCOTT WALKER. THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE HAPPY TO DO THAT. BURKE SECTOR CALL THE ROLL. ON AB TWENTY TO FORTY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE AYE LACKEY AYE AYE LACKEY AYE CARILLO. CARILLO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE. THAT MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR WOULD. AB NINETEEN NINETEEN. I HAVE A NOTE HERE. THIS SAYS TESTIMONY ONLY. UNDERSTOOD CRICKET OP. BEFORE MAKE SURE ROZAY PAGE GET GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. LATE ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER EIGHTH LAST YEAR WILDFIRES RAGED THROUGH NAPA CINEMA LAKE AND MENDOCINO COUNTIES AND LIVES WERE FOREVER CHANGED. THE FIRES THAT DESTROYED NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES AND CLEARLY IN INCLUDING NEARLY SIX THOUSAND HOMES IN MY DISTRICT ALONE. THOUSANDS MY CONSTITUENTS LUSTER OF HOMES THAT IN ONE NIGHT. THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO TOOK WHAT WAS ALREADY A DIFFICULT HOUSING MARKET AND TURNED IT INTO A CRISIS. THE NORTH A FIRESTORM BECAME QUICKLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE HISTORY AND IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. THE GOOD WORK OF MY COLLEAGUES INCLUDING MANY OF YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE HAS ENSURED THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE STRONG PRICE GOUGING PROTECTIONS. CURRENT LAW PREVENTS THE COST OF ANY GOOD OR SERVICE INCLUDING HOUSING OF FROM BEING RAISED MORE THAN TEN PERCENT DURING TO DECLARE DISASTER. UNFORTUNATELY UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORDS AND VACATION RENTAL HOST HAVE MANAGED TO SKIRT THESE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE. OF THOSE WHO LOST EVERYTHING. IN LESS THAN A WEEK THE MEDIAN RENTAL RATE IN CINEMA COUNTY JUMPED BY OVER THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. THERE WERE DOZENS OF EXAMPLES OF HOMES BEING OFFERED FOR MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PREVIOUS ASTOR PRICE OF SIMILAR HOMES. THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE A METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE BASE RENT OF A HOME. AND THAT AND THAT WAS NOT OF THAT WAS NOT ON THE RENTAL MARKET BEFORE DECLARE DISASTER. AS A RESULT HOMEOWNERS WHO WHO HAVE A SECOND HOME IN THE AREA. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT THEIR HOUSE ON THE MARKET PRETTY MUCH WHATEVER PRICE THEY WANT. WITH AN INFLUX A TEMPORARY INSURANCE MONEY FOR TEMPORARY LIVING EXPENSES AND THE LOSS OF OVER FIVE PERCENT OF THE COUNTIES HOUSING STOCK OVERNIGHT. MY DISTRICT IS BECOMEA PRIME HUNTING GROUND FOR LANDLORDS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FIRE VICTIMS. AB NINETEEN NINETEEN CLOSES THE NEW RENTAL LOOPHOLE IN EXISTING LAW BY REDEFINING BASED READ AS A HUNDRED SIXTY PERCENT OF THE HUD FAIR MARKET VALUE. THIS DEFINITION CLEAR PRO PROVIDES A CLEARLY DEFINED NUMBER OF FOR BOTH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS TO ENSURE EVERYONE IS PLAYING BY THE RULES. I LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF OF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. AND WHEN THE TIME COMES SAYS VOTE FOR A VOTE ON IT AT SOME POINT EVERY DAY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS. OF THE BILL IS A SEMI COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY A MAC CHEEVER AND CAROLINE FOWLER. U. MORNING MY NAME'S MATT CHEEVER I'M A I'M A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE CINEMA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I PROMOTED HIM I'M SORRY. YEAH THAT'S AS WELL TO GET THAT MAKES PERFECT. IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIRES AND AND AND AND ACTUALLY WILL SOME OF THE FIRES WERE STILL BURNING OUR OFFICE DID EXTENSIVE OUTREACH. TO TRY TO GET THE WORD OUT TO. REAL THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT PRICE GOUGING TO TRY TO. DO WE COULD TO DETER IT AND. WE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS FROM LANDLORDS TENANTS PROPERTY MANAGERS REALTORS. YOU NAME IT ASKING WHAT THEY COULDN'T COULDN'T DO WHAT THE LAW ALLOWED. THAT THERE WERE NUMEROUS QUESTIONS. AND WE ALSO RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS WE INVESTIGATED OVER TO OUR COMPLAINTS OF PRICE GOUGING. ALMOST ALL OF WHICH ARE RELATED TO RENTAL HOUSING. I AND WE THINK THAT THAT NUMBER'S UNREPORTED WE THINK THERE WERE MANY OF REPORTED CASES BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CALLED. WOULDN'T GIVE US THEIR NAME CONTACT INFORMATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WHEN NEEDED. TO DO AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE. FOR FEAR OF OF RETALIATORY EVICTIONS. SO FAR WE'VE FILED FOR CRIMINAL CASES ARE STILL PENDING IN THE COURTS AND WE HAVE. AND MANY OTHER CASES THAT WERE STILL REVIEWING FOR EITHER CRIMINAL OR CIVIL ENFORCEMENT. PEOPLE COULD SECTION THREE NINETY SIX CURRENTLY LUMPS RENTAL HOUSING AND WITH OTHER CONSUMER GOODS OR SERVICES LIKE BOTTLED WATER FOR EXAMPLE. AND WE'VE LEARNED INVESTIGATING IN REVIEWING THESE CASES THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL UNIQUE ISSUES. AND APPLYING TO APPLY THE STATUTE TO RENTAL HOUSING. THERE AREN'T ANY REPORTED CASES. THAT INTERPRET THREE NINETY SIX AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED OTHER IN VERY FEW PROSECUTION STATEWIDE UNDER THE STATUTE. BEFORE THE DISASTERS THAT WERE THAT WERE ADDRESSING NOW. WE NEED CLEAR STANDARDS FOR REAL ESTATE THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY FOR LANDLORDS TENANTS. AND FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DETER PRICE GOUGING AND TO MAKE PROSECUTIONS WORKABLE. AB NINETEEN NINETEEN WOULD CLARIFY CERTAIN ASPECTS OF PENAL CODE SECTION THREE NINETY SIX AS IT APPLIES TO HOUSING. I WOULD EXTEND THREE NINETY SIX IS A REACH TO A COUPLE OF SITUATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY COVERED. AND I'LL TALK FIRST ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATUE EXTENDED. OF THE CENTER OF THE PRESS DEMOCRAT RAN A STORY SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE FIRES THAT ACCORDING TO ZILLOW MEDIAN RENTS RENTS IN THE COUNTY. WERE UP THIRTY SIX PERCENT. THIS IS LARGE THIS WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO NEW RENTALS ON THE MARKET WHICH WERE. PROPERTIES THAT ONLY CAME UP FOR RENT AFTER. THE FIRES. AND FROM VACATION RENTALS THAT WERE NOW BEING OFFERED ON A MORE LONG TERM OR PERMANENT BASIS. AND OUR VIEW PEOPLE CUT THREE NINETY SIX ISN'T CURLY ADDRESS ADDRESS THOSE SITUATIONS. SO AFTER THE FIRE SOME PROPERTY OWNERS RECOGNIZE THAT COULD PULL THEIR HOMESTHAT WERE LISTED FOR SALE OFF THE MARKET. AND RENT THEM OUT INSTEAD FOR. A VERY HIGH RENTS AND SINCE THREE NINETY SIX DOZEN APPLIED THESE DO RENTALS. THEY COULD CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANTED. SIMILARLY VACATION RENTAL OWNERS. WHO HYPOTHETICALLY BEFORE THE FIRE MIGHT'VE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT? AND MAYBE RENT THEIR VACATION ROLL OUT TEN NIGHTS. A MONTH. EARNING YOU KNOW THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ROUGHLY. BUT ABSENT THE FIRE THEY WERE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CHARGE NOTES TO EARN NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH AND A LONG TERM LEASE. SO THE SITUATION SKEWED THE MARKET IS THE PRESS DEMOCRAT ARTICLE EXPLAINS. AND ALSO REYES BASIC FAIRNESS ISSUES ABOUT WHY ONE LANDLORD COULD ONLY CHARGE THREE OR FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH AND THEIR NEIGHBOR MIGHT BE ABLE TO CHARGE NINE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. HYPOTHETICALLY. BECAUSE OF THREE FOUR HUNDRED AND IT THREE FOUR THOUSAND. AND THE NEIGHBOR Y. PILCHARD NINE THOUSAND. IF IF THE. ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE FOLKS FROM PUTTING ADDITIONAL HOUSING ON THE MARKET. PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE'S A HOUSING SHORTAGE. WE BELIEVE AB NINETEEN IN NINETEEN WOULD PROVIDE A FAIR RETURN PROPERTY OWNERS WHO. WHO AREN'T ATTEMPTING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OF THE OF A DISASTER? AND EIGHT SO AB NINETEEN NINETEEN WOULD OFFER WOULD GO TO CLEAR MARKET MARKET STATE FAIR MARKET STANDARD IN THE SITUATIONS. WHICH WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY PERCENT OF THE FAIR MARKET RATE IS ESTABLISHED BY HIDING IT IS PUBLISHED ON THEIR ON HUD'S WEBSITE. AND NOT EASILY DETERMINABLE NUMBER. ITS EASY FOR LANDLORDS TO FIGURE OUT ITS EASY FOR US AS PROSECUTORS TO PROVE IF WE BRING THESE CASES TO COURT. AND THE NEXT YEAR I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSED OR OF ACTIONS BY LANDLORDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING RENTS BY MORE THAN TEN PERCENT. ACCORDING TO LEGAL AID CINEMA COUNTY SOUGHT TWENTY SIX PERCENT INCREASE IN EVICTIONS POSE FIRE. AND WE RECEIVED DOZENS AND DOZENS OF COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE EVICTED. AND THEN SAW THEIR FORMER HOUSE ADVERTISE THEIR MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN MUCH HIGHER RENT THEM WHAT THEY WERE PAYING. WE'VE YOU THE SITUATIONS IS MORE EGREGIOUS THAN NORMAL PRICE GOUGING THE EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM BY. CREATING MORE HOMELESS PEOPLE AND PUTTING THOSE PEOPLE INTO THE HOUSING MARKET. AND FURTHER. MAKING THE PROBLEM WORSE. SO AB NINETEEN WOULD ADDRESS THIS BY MAKING EVICTIONS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNLAWFUL. I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER NOW TO MY COLLEAGUE CAROLINE FOLLOWED FROM MY OFFICE TO DISCUSS. SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT WE THINK AB NINETEEN NINETEEN WOULD CLARIFY THE PRICE GOUGING LAW. THANK YOU CHAIR SIREN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT IS MR HUBER INDICATED ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT A. B. NINETEEN NINETEEN ATTEMPTS TO DO IS TO CLARIFY FOR THOSE. PROPERTY OWNERS WHO WERE ALREADY IN THE RENTAL HOUSING MARKET HOW THIS STATUTE APPLIES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S CURRENTLY LUMPED IN WITH GOODS AND SERVICES. THEY'RE NOT VERY. CLEAR ARTICULATE STANDARDS FOR THE REALTORS FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND. FOR THE TENANTS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED IN THE LARGE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CLARIFICATIONS. ADD TO DEFINE IN THE CONTEXT OF HOUSING WHAT THE BEFORE AND AFTER RENTAL PRICES ARE BASED ON. WOULD GREATLY ASSIST IN DETERRING THIS AND ASSIST US IN HAVING TO BRING PROSECUTIONS WHEN IT'S NECESSARY. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THE BILL WOULD DO IS ALSO CLARIFY THAT WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF RENTAL HOUSING IT COVERS MOBILE HOME PARKS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE WELL AWARE. I'M OUR MOBILE HOME PARKS AT UP IN OUR HOMES TO MANY SENIORS AND MANY LOW INCOME. AT TENANTS WE HAVE SEEN INSTANCES WHERE. MOBILE HOME RIGHT SPACES HAVE RECEIVED NOTICES IN ACCESS OF THE TEN PERCENT INCREASE AND BECAUSE THE PROPERTY OWNERS BELIEVE THAT MOBILE HOMES ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THE CURRENT LAW. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT POINT. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE'VE FACED IS THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE COME IN AND RIGHTFULLY TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR INSURANCE AND GET THEM HOUSING UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAS DRIVEN UP THE MARKET. AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF JUSTIFICATION FROM PROPERTY OWNERS THAT IT'S ONLY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SO WE'RE NOT REALLY PRICE GOUGING. BUT EVEN THOUGH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE PAYING THE TAB IT REALLY DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE VICTIMS BECAUSE IT DIMINISHES THEIR COVERAGE. SUCH THAT THEIR REPLACEMENT HOUSING MAY ONLY LAST FOR SIX MONTHS INSTEAD OF A YEAR OR LONGER THAT MAY TAKE FOR THEM TO REPLACE THEIR HOUSING. MORE IMPORTANTLY AT PRICES OUT THOSE VICTIMS WHO ARE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE INSURANCE WE HAD A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE RANCHERS. AND WHO LOST THEIR HOMES DURING THIS FIRE AND THEY HAVE NO INSURANCE AND THEY CAN'T COMPETE IF PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO. GO BEYOND THE PRICES THAT ARE SET FORTH IN PENAL CODE SECTION THREE NINETY SIX. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE WITH THE CURRENT VERSION OF THREE NINETY SIX THERE'S THERE'S A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS. AND THE SELLER OF GOODS TO THAT WERE ON SALE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EMERGENCY DEBATE THE TEN PERCENT INCREASE ON THE REGULAR PRICE OF THE GOOD. SILVA BOTTLED WATER WAS ON SALE FOR A DOLLAR NINETY FIVE MINUTES NORMALLY TO FIFTY. AND THE SELLER CAN GO BACK TO THE TWO FIFTY PER PRICE AND THEN INCREASE IT BY TEN PERCENT. AND WE'VE RECEIVED ARGUMENTS FROM OWNERS THAT THIS MEANS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN THEIR PROPERTY TO FAIR MARKET VALUE IF IT WAS. AND I DON'T BELOW MARKET RATE BE PRIOR TO THE EMERGENCY. THIS CREATES A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT STANDARD TO DETERMINE WHAT SHOULD BE THE FAIR MARKET RENTAL IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. THOSE MISTER CHEEVER SAID WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS A FAIR EASILY DETERMINABLE RATE THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE TO THE PUBLIC TO THE REAL ESTATE COMMUNITY AND TO THE PROPERTY OWNERS. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY THEY'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH US TO EDUCATE THEIR MEMBERS AND I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING FOR A COMMON GOOD OF TRYING TO MAKE IT CLEAR LAW. THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS. AND WE WITH THANK YOU AND REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON AB NINETEEN NINETEEN THANK THANK YOU. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT NAME IN. ORGANIZATION YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN A DEBRA CARL FOR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. AND THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CLARITY WE APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION THAT WE HAVE SO FAR. THANK YOU. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. IN SUPPORT. BOOKS. IT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DANVILLE ASSAULT ON HALF A LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IT'S PART. THANK YOU. NICHOLAS GONZALEZ OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANYWHERE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. WHAT TAKE A SEAT? I'M CATHERINE OR WITH THE WESTERN MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITIES WERE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO DEAL WITH THE UP THE MOBILE HOME PARK SPACES. MOST OF NOT ALL THOSE SPACES ARE CURRENTLY UNDER RENT CONTROL SO THE TEN PERCENT MAYBE. VERY LOW IF SOMEBODY HAS BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND NOW SPACE. WHAT OF NORMALLY GONE UP? SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM ON THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS A CREAM GREASY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS OVER CURRENTLY AN IN BETWEEN A POSITION WE WERE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. ON. AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT A LANDLORD MAY STILL OF TENANT FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT A DURING THE TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. SO I BELIEVE THOSE AMENDMENTS BEING TAKEN TODAY IN COMMITTEE AND WE DO WANT TO SINCERELY THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THAT ONE ONCE WAS AMENDMENTS ARM PRINT WE WILL BE MOVING TO A NEUTRAL POSITION. THANK YOU. SO ARE YOU BOTH TWEENER. OKAY. OFFICIAL TERMINOLOGY HERE. MAYBE. ADDICT. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DIRT KILEY VERY INQUISITIVE TODAY. SO I I YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE A GOOD DEBATE AS TO WHETHER I THE SORT OF RESTRICTIONS ARE THAT HUMANE WAY TO RESPOND CONDITIONS OF OF TEMPORARY SCARCITY BUT I. THE QUESTION I WOULD ASK IS IS THE. IS IS USING THE CRIMINAL LAW AND THE SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOTICED THE SUPPORT FOR SOME D. A.'S HERE I AND I HEAR WHAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WHY ARE WE TREATING THE PENALTIES Y. ARE MAKING MORE THINGS ILLEGAL. OUT WIRE WIRE CIVIL PENALTIES AND NOT ADEQUATE TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHY DO WE HAVE TO. TRY TO CRIMINALIZE WHAT WOULD ORDINARILY BE JUST TYPICAL MARKETPLACE ACTIVITY. WELL. SO PEOPLE COULD THREE NINETY SIX IS THAT RT PROVIDES THE CRIMINAL LIABILITY IN THIS IN THIS AREA. BUT IT DOES ALSO MAKE. THESE VIOLATIONS UNLAWFUL. UNDER BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SEVENTEEN TO HUNDREDS OF THE CIVIL ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU. SO I THINK I THINK THE ANSWER IS. BUT THIS ATTORNEYS HAVE DISCRETION TO BRING THESE ACTIONS EITHER CRIMINAL OR CIVIL E. BASED ON. A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT HEMINGWAY WHEN WHEN REVIEWING A CASE IN DETERMINING WHAT THE APPROPRIATE RESOLUTION WOULD. AT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA TRY TO CREATE NEW LAW WE'RE TRYING TO. MODIFY EXISTING LAW AND THE CRIMINAL THE CRIMINAL PENALTIES ARE ALREADY THERE. I THINK IT DOES EXTEND THEM TO ENCOMPASS THE AREAS THAT NOW YOU'RE BRINGING ON IBM BUT IF THAT IS RIGHT NOT JUST WATCHING EXPANSION CURRENT LAW CORRECT YEAH SO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT MISTER WHAT AND WHY IS IT THAT WE NEED TO. USE THE CRIMINAL LAW HERE. RATHER THAN JUST THE CIVIL PENALTIES THAT ARE ALSO THAT WELL I WOULD SAY THAT. YOU KNOW I. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT IS THE A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO HAVE DISCRETION I THINK THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE REALLY REALLY EGREGIOUS AND I THINK THOSE ARE DESERVE OF A HIGHER POTENTIAL PENALTY QUITE FRANKLY. I THINK IT ALSO CREATES A GREATER DETERRENT FOR THOSE THAT ARE INCLINED TO DO IT AS OPPOSED TO JUST FACTORING IN THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. TO JUSTIFY THEM JACKING UP THEIR RATES TO HIGH RATE AND THEN DEAL WITH THAT LATER ECONOMICALLY RATHER THAN. HAVING A THREAT OF A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AGAINST THEM. YEAH SO I SEE YOUR POINT I MEAN JUST SEEMS THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF THESE ACTORS DOING THIS IS TO YOU KNOW MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS AND IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE CIVIL PENALTIES THAT OUR MONETARY NATURE THAT WOULD. COUNTERACT THAT BENEFIT THEM THAT THAT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT RENT ME OUR HOPE IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO TURN IN AN IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD LIKE TO NOT EVER HAVE TO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S BEEN. VERY DIFFICULT HAVING TO LISTEN TO THE VICTIMS OF THE FIRE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SO WE FEEL THAT THERE IS A GREATER DETERRENT EFFECT. DO YOU HAVE THE CRIMINAL. PROCESS THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND. YOU MAY. CONCLUDE. HUESO THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THINK FOR THE QUESTIONS THIS IS AN ACUTE PROBLEM IN IN OUR AREA AND. AND WE WANNA BE SURE THAT IN THE FUTURE OTHER OTHER AREAS DO NOT EXPERIENCE THE SAME SAME KIND OF ISSUE AT THE END OF THE DAY. INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE PAYING FOR A LOT OF A LOT OF THESE. HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN RENTED AT REALLY REALLY HIGH RATES AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE AS CONSUMERS WILL PAY FOR THAT. IN IN HIGHER PREMIUMS FOR FOR INSURANCE AS WELL IN THE MEANTIME. THAT THE CONSUMER LOSES UMP THE RENTAL MARKET IS ALREADY EXTREMELY TIGHT. AND. WE'RE JUST GOING TO GIVE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THE DISCRETION BILL TO GO AFTER THE MOST EGREGIOUS ACTORS HERE. AND. HOPEFULLY I CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND PROTECT OUR CITIZENS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEY GOT IN A NOTICES FOR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR. WE JUST RAN OUT OF TIME. WERE WORD SMITHING ON THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW WHERE. WE'RE SO CLOSE IT. WE COULD BE BACK VERY SOON AND SO ANYONE THAT HAS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS I WOULD GET TO MISTER WOULD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WHERE THAT CLOSE. ON TO COMING BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE WHICH I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY. TOM BUT AYE RECOMMENDATION SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ONLY AND WILL HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE YOU BACK REAL SOON THANK YOU ARE SEARCHING CHAIR WILL SEE IT WOULD JUST VOTE ON IT WENT OKAY. I'LL BE HERE TO WATCH THE VOTE TO BE HERE TO WATCH THE VOTE. MR VOEPEL WHO'S BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING FOR. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER VOEPEL ROGER THAT SERVE MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU AID BE. TWENTY ONE SIXTY NINE THAT ENABLES VEHICLE RENTAL COMPANIES TO REPORT THEFT AS VEHICLES BECOME OVER DO. RATHER THAN BEING REQUIRED TO WAIT FIVE DAYS AFTER THE AGREED UPON VEHICLE RETURN DAY. VEHICLE THEFT IS UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT ANY WASTED TIME IN THE REPORTING PROCESS ALLOWS THE CRIMINAL TO FURTHER. GEOGRAPHICALLY DISCONNECT FROM THE SCENE. MOTIVATION FOR AUTOMOBILE THEFT IS HIGHER WHEN THERE WAS A FIVE DAY GRACE PERIOD GIVEN. LEAVING PLENTY OF TIME TO FLEE THE SCENE AND DISMEMBER THE VEHICLE FOR THE SALE OF PARTS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE RENTAL COMPANY AND THE PERSON PRESUMED TO BE STEALING THE CAR. VIA CELL PHONE TELEPHONE TAX ACCEPT IRA AND WHATEVER FUTURE TECHNOLOGY MAY COME. AND IF LEFT UNRESPONSIVE THROUGH A MAIL NOTICE SNAIL MAIL NOTICE IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE MISUNDERSTANDINGS. WHEN FRAUD IS DISCOVERED IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT BE NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY RATHER THEM WAITING UNTIL THE FIVE DAYS EXPIRE AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE CAR RENTAL LEASE. COLLEAGUES ASK YOU THAT TODAY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT SIMPLY EXPEDITED IMPROVES THE SYSTEM OF TRACKING DOWN STOLEN CARS. THIS EMPOWERS THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL VEHICLE PROPERTY AND ENABLES THAT SECURITY IS NO DIFFERENT. THAN THE PROTECTIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST AROUND ANY OTHER FORM OF CAPITAL. AND THE AMENDMENTS DO YOU. EXCEPT THE AMENDMENT. ABSOLUTELY. WE NEED YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE AT RISK YES SIR. DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES. SUPPORT. OF THERE IS NO OPPOSITION THAT I'M AWARE OF AND I DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE THE COMMITTEES TARNISHES IN SUPPORT. THE MAC IS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT NO YOU GO. AHEAD OF ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SHARKEY WOULD WANNA WITH PENTAGON VAN RENTALS. HERE IN SUPPORT. OTHER ANY WITNESSES THAT OPPOSITION. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THE BILL BUT JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT BUT WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS. WORKING WITH US ON SOME CONCERNS THAT WE HAD AND LOOK FORWARD TO. CONTINUING TO WORK ON THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING. A. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE BILL. SEC DID YOU. I JUST HAVE A QUESTION I AM IS THIS A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER THEFTS LIKE. IN CAR RENTAL WE KNOW WHO THE PERSON IS WHO IS RENTING A CAR CRACKED. CORRECT IS ONLY AS THEIR PRESENT DEAN. ACCURATE AND TRUE IDENTIFICATION EXCEPT FOR ALSO YOU HAVE. IN INSURANCE ISSUE IN THE SENSE THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO ARE LEGALLY RENTING CARS. WILL. WORK AT LEAST ONE THEFT SO THEY DON'T ESTABLISH A PATTERN. AND WORK OUT A DEAL WITH WHOEVER'S CHOP IN THE CAR SO I MEAN THERE THERE IS THIS IS A. A VIABLE. NOT GREAT LEAD. BURNING NEED TO NEED BUT IT IS GOOD ESPECIALLY WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. TO KEEP TRACK OF RENTAL FLEETS. BUT ANY OTHER WITNESS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER QUIRK. SO. I THINK FORTY EIGHT HOURS IS A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME. I WOULDN'T HAVE CONCERNED IF IT WENT TO THREE DAYS HERE FOR ABOUT. I'M OKAY WITHOUT TWO DAYS. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE SOMEBODY HOLDING THE CAR OVER TWO DAYS IN NOT REPORTING THAT SAM OKAY WITH THAT. WE HAVE AN INCONSISTENCY YEAR IN THAT YOU CAN'T USE THE GPS TO TRACK THE CAR FOR A WEEK. ARM IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO WORK OUT SOMETHING AS YOU GO INTO IT IF THE BILL MAKES IT TO THE SENATE. I WOULD SUGGEST DISCUSSING THAT WITH. AS A POSSIBLE AMENDMENT IN THE SENATE TO ALLOW GPS TRACKING ONCE THE CAR HAS BEEN REPORTED AS HIM BASALT AS YOU DISCUSS. THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY. YOU MAKE CONCLUDE. GOOD TO VOTE YES PLEASE. WE HAVE A MOTION JESSICA. CALL NOW HONORED OLDER RIGHT PATIENTS YES ON AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY I GOT VIDEO. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE THAT IS YOUR PATH THAT MEASURE PRESSES CONGRADULATIONS. MISTER WEINER. S. B.. SEVEN EIGHT FIVE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY FIVE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GREAT. I MISSED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY. I SB SEVENTY FIVE I DON'T BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFFS. FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE BILL AND A LAST WEEK WE DID PUT AMENDMENTS ACROSS THAT REFLECT THE. COMMITTEES ARE. REQUESTED AMENDMENTS TO THOSE SHOULD ALL BE IMPRINT OUT BEFORE YOU. ARE TODAY. SP SEVENTY FIVE. IS THEY ARE PROCEDURAL CHANGE THE EVIDENCE CODE. TO PREVENT IRRELEVANCE INFORMATION ABOUT A WITNESSES IMMIGRATION STATUS OPERA BEING MENTIONED IN OPEN COURT. ODDLY VERY CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT. EXCLUDE ANY EVIDENCE THEIR OTHER LOOK. LAWS ON THE BOOKS. DIED. INDICATE WHEN IMMIGRATION STATUS IS RELEVANT OR IRRELEVANT. THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE ADMISSIBILITY OR LACK THERE OF. OF IMMIGRATION STATUS ALL IT DOES IS CREATE A PROCEDURAL PROTECTION. AYE SO THAT WHEN IMMIGRANT IS TESTIFYING. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A PROFFER FIRST TO THE JUDGE TO SHOW THE ADMISSIBILITY OF IMMIGRATION STATUS BEFORE YOU JUST BLURTED OUT IN COURT. I THIS IS A VERY REAL ISSUE WE ARE SEEING OP I IMMIGRANTS ON THE STAND. BEING GRATUITOUSLY QUESTION HEY WHAT'S YOUR IMMIGRATION STATUS AYE EVEN IF IT HAS NO CONCEIVABLE RELEVANCE IMMIGRATION STATUS CAN BE RELEVANT UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. I UP TO GO IN A CRIMINAL CASE TO SHOW BIAS. BY ANOTHER AND OTHER SITUATIONS IT'S COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AND IT ADMISSIBLE. AND SO WE ARE SIMPLY SAYING THAT IF AN ATTORNEY WANTS TO QUESTION. AND IMMIGRANT ABOUT HIS OR HER IMMIGRATION STATUS. YOU HAVE TO GO IN CAMERA WITH THE JUDGE MAKE A PROPER. IS WHAT I WANT TO ASK I AM THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE IT'S ADMISSIBLE. AND THE JUDGE WILL THEN MAKE A RULING AND IF THE JUDGE RULES IT'S ADMISSIBLE YOU GO BACK OUT IN THE OPEN COURT AND YOU ASKED THE QUESTION. THIS IS VERY SIMILAR IT'S ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE PROCEDURE THAT ALREADY EXISTS IN RAPE CASES ARE WHERE IF YOU HAVE. DE VICTIM ON THE STAND AS AN ATTORNEY YOU CAN'T JUST GO UP AND START QUESTIONING THE WITNESS THE WITNESS ABOUT HIS OR HER SEXUAL HISTORY. YOU FIRST HAVE TO GO AND MAKE A PROFFER TO THE JUDGE. ABOUT WHY IT'S ADMISSIBLE AND THE JUDGE WILL THEN MAKE A RULING. ON THIS HAS A REAL. CONSEQUENCES ALONE WE START HAVING HARASSING AND GRATUITOUS IN A RELEVANT QUESTIONING OF IMMIGRANTS ON THE STAND ABOUT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. OUGHT WE WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE. GOING TO QUIRK. I AND WHAT IF THE MINUTE THAT IMMIGRANTS. I THINK THAT IF I GO TOO COR I'M GONNA BE ASKED ABOUT MY IMMIGRATION STATUS AND I MIGHT GET DEPORTED. THERE NOT GONNA GO TO QUIRK THAT ARE GOING TO REPORT CRIMES ARE NOT GOING TO SHOW UP AT TESTIFIES VICTIM OR AS A WITNESS AND WE WILL ALL BE LESS SAFE. WE KNOW THAT I USE IS IN OUR COURT HOUSES OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES HAS TOLD US THAT WHEN OUR CHIEF JUSTICE. OUR YOU WHO A REPUBLICAN APPOINTED BY REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR ASKED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT TO DO THAT STOP STALKING PEOPLE IN OUR. COURTHOUSES AND JEFF SESSIONS RESPONDED. WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE COURT HOUSES. AND WHILE WE CAN'T PHYSICALLY STOP THEM ALTHOUGH THERE IS A BILL ON THAT. WE CAN AT LEAST MAKE SURE THAT OUR ATTORNEYS. ARE NOT. CAUSING IMMIGRANTS TO BE FEARFUL OUGHT TO GO TO COURT. WE HAVE. WORKED EXTENSIVELY ON THIS BILL WE DID HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IN THE SENATE WITH THE I BELIEVE THIRTY TWO VOTES IF MY MEMORY SERVES. AND WE HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS. WITH. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. WITH THE NEWSPAPER EDITORS AND WE TAKE IN NUMEROUS. AMENDMENTS. I'M I DO WANT TO KNOW. THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS JUST. CAME OUT I THINK LAST WEEK AGAINST THE BILL I'M NOT THEY'RE NOT AGAINST OUR PHILOSOPHICALLY AGAINST THE BILL. BUT THEY WANT US TO PUT AN AMENDMENT IN ABOUT. MAKING ABOUT BRADY. OBLIGATIONS CLUB THE BILL IS VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE DISCOVERY OBLIGATION SO IT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS TO PUT THAT AND. AND WE WE ACTUALLY TALK TO COMMITTEE STAFF ABOUT THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS NOT. IN THE EVIDENCE CODE THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO BE PUTTING. RULES ABOUT BRADY OBLIGATIONS DOES EXIST AND THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE OUR. NOT IN ANY WAY. I DO. WANT TO NOTE THAT SINCE WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK SOME AMERICANS OFF FLETCHER FOR PARTNERING WITH US ON THE BILL. SINCE WINS INTRODUCED THAT ARE WATCHING AND STAY ADOPTED A SIMILAR RULE AS A RULE OF COURT. SO I COLLEAGUES I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND I WANT TO. TURNED OVER TO MY TWO WITNESSES TODAY CHRIS SANCHEZ I WITH THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND KATIE MILLER ON BEHALF OF OUR SPONSOR THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I I REALLY WANT TO THANK SENATOR WIENER FOR HIS SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP ON THIS. VERY IMPORTANT BILL TO OUR OFFICE I'M WITH THE CLIMATE OF FEAR IN OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. RAISING THE AND THE STATUS OF THURMOND IMMIGRATION INQUIRED IF IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO THE CASE IS REALLY DONE FOR NO PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO DISSUADE ARE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES FROM FEELING COMFORTABLE PARTICIPATING IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND MAYOR A CRITICAL PART OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IN OUR ABILITY TO BE EFFECTIVE IN BOTH PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE OF CASES. AND WE KNOW THAT HAVING FOLKS COME FORWARD WHEN THERE'S A CRIME AS THE SENATOR SAID REALLY PROMOTES COMMUNITY SAFETY. AND AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE LOOKED AT SOME DATA IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO. OF REPORTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENTS AND WE SAW SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN OUR ASIAN AND LATINO COMMUNITIES SO IT'S JUST A SIGN OF HOW I THINK IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE FOLKS ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT COMING FORWARD AND BEING PART OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. I'M WHEN IMMIGRATION IS AN ISSUE FOR THEM. A WE ARE PLEASED TO. TO BE A PART OF THIS BILL WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT WE THINK IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR ABILITIES AGAIN BUT TO PROSECUTE CASES BUT ALSO IN THE BUILDING A DEFENSE TO BRING IN WITNESSES WHEN THEY NEED TO. HOOK HIM HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN BUILDING THEIR CASE. AND I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT OUR PUBLIC DEFENDER IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS SUPPORTED THE SPELL. AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT AS WELL SIR THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. YOU. CHRIS RESPONSIBLE CHAIR OF THE COALITION FOR ME IMMIGRANT RIGHTS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I JUST LIKE ALL THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT I AYE EARLIER THIS YEAR IN JANUARY I SENT OUT A DIRECTIVE ARE REGARDING THE POLICY THAT THE AGENT SHOULD BE HAVING WHEN ENTERING COURTROOMS AND APPREHENDING INDIVIDUALS. THE DIRECTIVE CLEARLY STATES THAT THEY SHOULD BE TARGETING SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS HOWEVER ARE WE KNOW THE ICE AGENTS HAVE BEEN WAITING OUTSIDE COURT ROOMS. ARE AS A RESPONSE TO THIS OUR DIRECTIVE AS THEY. ARE NO LONGER BEING TOLD TO PICK UP ANYONE ON. A IN THE CALL INSIDE THE COURTROOM HOWEVER OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM WE HAVE REPORTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN QUOTE UNQUOTE STOCKED OUTSIDE THE COURTROOMS ARE WHEN SOMEONE MIGHT BE RELEASED OUR FIRST YOU KNOW THEM. THERE'S NO CHARGE OR THEY'RE NOT ARRESTED THERE'S JUST OUTLINED FOR HEARING AND AS THEY COME OUT OF THE COURTROOM VIENEN ARE DETAINED BY ICE. HA SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE HIGHLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THREE I'VE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT NAME AND ORGANIZATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STAFF ASSAULT ON BEHALF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S PRESENTING ALAMEDA COUNTY. ARMENIANS ARE MILEY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAROLING ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN THE SAN FRANCISCO COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN PUT IN SUPPORT TICKET. TALK. NICHOLAS GONZALEZ FOR THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT. YOU. ARE ANY WITNESSES ARE YOU BETWEEN. THAT CHAIR MEMBERS TAMPON FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AS THE SENATOR INDICATED WE HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH HIM HIS STAFF THE SPONSORS A AND COMMITTEE STEFAN. AT THE MOST RECENT ROUND OF AMENDMENTS WHICH MAKES THE BILL MUCH MORE WORKABLE FOR THE COURTS AND WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS WE NOW HAVE NO POSITION TO REMOVE OUR PRIOR CONCERTS THANK. THANK YOU. WHAT WILL YOU? IF YOU CAME HERE TWEENER IT MILLION DO NOW. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN VERS ACROSS YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE HERE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF COOL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS. IN PRIVATE PRACTICE ALSO WORKING PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES. WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL YET WE'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE SINCE LAST YEAR THROUGHOUT LAST YEAR. ON THIS BILL SOME OF OUR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED OTHER STILL SOME A FEW THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT. BEEN A COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. TWO THINGS WE DO TAKE ISSUE WITH REPRESENTATION THAT FROM A DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARE. A GRATUITOUSLY ASKING THESE QUESTIONS AND COR ARE MEMBERS WE SURVEYED A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING AT LEAST WITH OUR MEMBERS I JUST WANNA PUT THAT ON THE RECORD. HOWEVER WE DO WORK A LOT ON THESE IMMIGRATION ISSUES WE'VE COSPONSORED. BILLS WITHOUT WITH SOME OF THE PROPONENTS. HERE WE DO WITH THE. SOME WOMAN GONZALEZ FLETCHER WERE WORKING ON BILL RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT AND ALSO WE THINK IT'S. UNFORTUNATE THAT WITH ICE GOING TO COURT HOUSES THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT THAT'S HOW WE LOOK AT THIS BILL BUT WE STILL THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF PROCEDURAL ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE. CLARIFIED I DO APPRECIATE AND REALLY LIKE THE AMENDMENTS BUT PUT FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE TO WILL CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK. SOMETHING OUT GOING FOR. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM E. WERE WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THE BILL. UNFORTUNATE WE HAVEN'T GOT TO A POINT YET WHERE. WERE OFF THE BILL. BUT I I DO WANT TO INFORM THE COMMITTEE ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE AND WHY WE ARE STILL OPPOSED. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE AN AUTOMATIC GAG ORDER FOR ANY PARTICIPANT IN A CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. AND THAT DOES NOT MEET THE CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS CREATED BY THE U. S. SUPREME COURT FOR. PROCEEDINGS IN BOTH A CIVIL OR CRIMINAL CONTEXT. THERE IS A PRESUMPTIVE RIGHT OF ACCESS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS TO DIS TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS. AND. THAT CAN BE OVERCOME WHEN IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO CLOSE EVEN PARTIALLY. FOR A MORE COMPELLING INTEREST AND IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT. THE ADMISSIBILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S IMMIGRATION STATUS MEETS THAT STANDARD. ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND UNDER THE EXISTING RULES RIGHT NOW WE THINK THAT THAT WORKS WELL. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS. A PROBLEM WITH. THESE ROUTINE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE AGREED TO INITIALLY BEING MADE. EXISTING ONE NOW PROVIDES THAT THE ATTORNEY WHO. OUR FEELS THAT WAY CAN OBJECT AND THEN GO BEFORE THE JUDGE AND THAT DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE AT THAT POINT BUT IT'S IN AN OPEN COURTROOM. THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A PER SE BAN ON THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO SEE THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THE JUDGE'S QUESTIONS ON THE PARTICULAR ISSUE. AND THAT CAN BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO WITNESSES. AND THE HIGH PROFILE TRIALS EVEN ON THERE WAS A SITUATION IN ORANGE COUNTY WHERE THIS ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF WAS PLANTING JAIL INFORMANTS. ARE IN ORDER TO EXTRACT CERTAIN TESTIMONY FROM ALLEGED DEFENDANTS IN THEIR CUSTODY. AND THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT THE PUBLIC FROM SEEING THE JUDGES. ARE PROBING OF THOSE WITNESSES WITH RESPECT TO THE IMMIGRATION STATUS. WE WOULD ALL BE DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. MOREOVER WE DON'T THINK THAT DECISIONS THE OBJECTIVE THAT IT STATED TO CHIEF ARM BECAUSE. IT'S NOT GONNA PROVIDE A LEVEL OF COMFORT TO THOSE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED COMING FORWARD BECAUSE THERE'S STILL THE POSSIBILITY EVEN IN THIS PROCEEDING. THAT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS WILL COME OUT AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN. ARMED THERE STILL NOT GOING TO WANT TO COME FORWARD AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE PROCESS. AND. IN DOING SO ARE HOWEVER THE JUDICIAL IN THE. INTEGRITY OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS WILL BE COMPROMISED AND WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS. ENOUGH. AND FOR THAT REASON WE'RE POST FINICKY. ANY OTHER WITNESS. GOOD MORNING GUS HERE AM I DS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER ASSOCIATION AND FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR WE ARE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. AND FOR. AND WE HOPE TO MOVIE FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK. IN PROTECTING IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS ARE BOTH VERY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OBVIOUSLY. WE ARE CONCERNED. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE PROCEDURAL ASPECT IN TERMS OF WHAT COMES IN DURING THE PROCEEDINGS WE ARE MUCH MORE CONCERNED WITH WHAT WE GET BEFORE THOSE PROCEEDINGS. BECAUSE OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT THERE'S BEEN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF CONFUSION REGARDING THE PROTECTIONS SURROUNDING THE U. VISA WHICH IS AN IMMIGRATION BENEFIT THAT IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAVE? PARTICIPATED AND WHO HAVE ACTUALLY RECEIVED A CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION I'M SORRY. A CERTIFICATE OF HELPFULNESS FROM THE PROSECUTING AGENCY OR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHICH IS A PREREQUISITE BEFORE PERSON CAN EVEN APPLY FOR THIS IMMIGRATION BENEFIT. SO WHAT WE WANT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT WITHSTANDING PILL COULD SECTION SIX SEVENTY NINE ELEVEN WHICH PER FOUGHT PROVIDES THE PROCEDURES FORGETTING THAT CERTIFICATION WITHIN NINETY DAYS THAT IF A PERSON HAS RECEIVED THIS CERTIFICATION. NOTWITHSTANDING SOME OF THE THAT THERE SOME CONFUSING LANGUAGE IN SOME SIX SEVENTY NINE POINT ELEVEN AND IN MY OPINION THE LANGUAGE THAT'S CURRENTLY CONTAINED. AND AS THE STATUTE IS PRESENTLY DROPPED IT IS INSUFFICIENT TO PUT MAKE SURE THAT PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES AND FRANKLY EVEN DEFENSE COUNSEL UNDERSTAND. THAT THE RULES INVOLVING DISCOVERY AND BRADY ARE APPLICABLE EVEN IN THESE SITUATIONS AND I FEAR THAT IF WE DON'T GET THE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY WITH. SENATOR WIENER STAFF MEMBERS THAT WE WILL NOT GET THAT INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAD A CLIP WE HAD A CLIENT IN LOS ANGELES AND THIS WOMAN WAS A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SHE ONE DAY DEFENDED HERSELF AND HER HUSBAND HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND WAS ENTERED IN THE PROCESS. NOW. AS A RESULT OF THESE INJURIES SHE WAS CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND IT WAS NOT INTO HELL WE WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE INFORMATION REGARDING HIS APPLICATION AND HIS STATEMENT IN SUBMITTING THE U. VISA APPLICATION. THAT WE FOUND OUT THAT HIS STORY HAD HAD THAT HIS VERSION OF WHAT HE SUBMITTED TO DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HOW. HOW HE PRESENTED THE INFORMATION TO THE POLICE OFFICERS AT THE TIME OF THE ARREST? AS A RESULT OF GETTING THAT INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. THEN WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE A DISMISSAL FOR THIS CLIENT AND BY THE WAY SHE HERSELF WAS AN IMMIGRANT AND BY DOING SO SHE AVOIDED A CONVICTION FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHICH ALLOWED HER TO NOT BE DEPORTED AND STAY IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER CHILDREN. SO I DISAGREE THAT THE THE STATUTE AS THE BILL AS IS CURRENTLY WORDED IS SUFFICIENT TO PROPERLY PROTECT BUT THE BRADY. THE BRADY THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED UNDER BRADY VERSUS MARYLAND AND I WOULD PASS I THINK IT'S A SIMPLE. WAY TO FIX THE STATURE AND THERE WE WOULD OF. I WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION AT ALL THAT WE ARE ASKING IS JUST FOR CLARIFICATION THAT THE BRADY VERSUS MARYLAND DISCOVERY PROCEDURES ARE FULLY EMPLACED. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE A QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. GONZALEZ FLETCHER I JUST WANNA THANK YOU OBVIOUSLY I'M A CO AUTHOR ON THIS I KNOW. THAT WERE BOTH COMMITTED TO TO MAKING UP A LAW THAT PROTECTS TO THE TO THE ADMISSIBILITY. IMMIGRANTS ON ALL SIDES OF THE LEGAL STATUS IT WILL SAY I'M TO THE TO THE GERMAN CAME BEFORE WE WE DID THIS BILL. WITH REGARD TO TO CIVIL MATTERS ALREADY AND IT HAS ALREADY. CHANGE BEHAVIOR OMELET WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING FORWARD AND ABLE TO. GO TO COURT NO WAY. THAT PROTECTS THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR. IMMIGRATION TASK BEING USED AGAINST THEM SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S A TOUGH WORK I UNDERSTAND AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR. I'M IT'S ALWAYS EASIER TO BE THE JOINT AUTHORED SIT BACK WHILE THE OTHER WORK GETS DONE. SAW ONE APPLY THE AUTHOR AND ON THE WORK HE'S BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND I KNOW HE'LL CONTINUE. ON TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORK S. THAT ACCOUNT SAM I'M DEFINITELY WILL LIVE THE BILL. SECOND. YOUR QUESTION. YOU MAY CLOSE. I THANK YOU SO CHAIRMAN TOUCH WITH BROAD VERY BRIEFLY I I WON A CLEAR REGARDING MR HERNANDEZ'S SAW STATEMENT WE'RE NOT IMPLYING THAT ALL. ATTORNEYS ARE DOING US A LARGE MAJORITY OF COLONEL DEFENSE TURNS ARE NOT DOING THIS IT'S I THINK IT'S IT'S REAL. AND NOT JUST IN SAN FRANCISCO TO LA TO BUT IT'S NOT EVERYONE DOING AT MOST TURNS ARE NOT DOING US. THIS DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO THE FACT THAT APPLIES TO THE PROSECUTION. ARE AS WELL AS AT A REPLIES TO EVERYONE BECAUSE REALLY ANYONE ANY ATTORNEY COULD BE TEMPTED. OUGHT TO DO THIS. AND THEN IN TERMS I JUST TO BE CLEAR TURNS THE BRADY WE DO HAVE A STATEMENT IN THERE THAT WHEN AND I I BELIEVE. DURING THE SENATE PROCESS THAT NOTHING IN THE BILL LIMITS DISCOVERY IN A CRIMINAL ACTION AND. AND JUST MAKING CLEAR WHAT WAS IMPLICIT. AND I THINK. WE AGREE WITH. THE COMMITTEE THAT PUTTING AN ACTUAL AFFIRMATIVE BRADY OBLIGATION INTO THIS BILL JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT OBLIGATION EXISTS. AND FRANKLY BY PUTTING IT INTO THE BILL IT ALMOST IMPLIES THAT MAYBE IT DOESN'T EXIST OTHERWISE. AYE I THINK BRADY IS WHAT IT IS TO BE DISCOVERED IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THAT HAPPENING THAT THAT'S A BROADER ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS THE VEHICLE TO. TO DO THAT BUT I DO RESPECT. THE POSITION PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS. WE HAVE A. WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND METRIC CALLED WORLD. S. B. SEVENTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY I CARILLO. KALLIO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY KILEY AYE QUIRK.

THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE COUPLE WITNESSES. YEAH WHO LIKE TO BEGIN MISTER CHAIR BRIGHT ENOUGH WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FAIR FOREMAN HEARING OUR FAVORITE.

TIFFANY MATHIS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING LUCIA MUCH I'M HALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ELIZABETH ESPINOSA ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALSO IN SUPPORT. YOU. LIEUTENANT SHIRLEY SO WILLIAM SEVERED IN A SHERIFF'S ON BEHALF OF SHERIFF MCMAHON IN SUPPORT. YOU. BRANCH ALONG WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. I WE RESPECTFULLY MUST OPPOSED TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. I DO WANT TO START BY THANKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO AND HIS STAFF FOR AND ENGAGING WITH DISCUSSIONS WITH US ABOUT OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT'S DISCUSSIONS AND HOPEFULLY. TO RESOLVING THOSE CONCERNS. THAT SAID. LET ME ASK EACH OF YOU TO IMAGINE JUST FOR A MOMENT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF ABUSING A CHILD. THIS UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT A RARE OCCURRENCE AND NOW IT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU. IMAGINE THAT YOU'VE BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED YOU ARE ALSO NOTIFIED THAT YOUR NAME IS GOING TO BE INCLUDED ON A LIST OF PERSONS SUSPECTED OF CHILD ABUSE. WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED BY VARIOUS AGENCIES IN CONNECTION WITH SOME KINDS OF LICENSING AND EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS IN IN IN ADDITION TO. INVESTIGATIONS OF OTHER CHILD ABUSE. YOUR CASE GOES TO TRIAL YOU ARE NOT ONLY ACQUITTED BUT THE JUDGE MAKES A FINDING OF FACTUAL INNOCENCE. YOU THEN SEEK TO HAVE YOUR NAME REMOVED FROM THE LIST. ONLY TO BE TOLD BY THE AGENCY THAT INITIALLY CONDUCTED THE INVESTIGATION THAT IT STILL BELIEVES THE IT IT THE ALLEGATIONS TO BE SUBSTANTIATED. AND THAT THEREFORE YOUR NAME WILL REMAIN ON THE LAST. YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE STIGMA OF BEING A CUTE AN ACCUSED CHILD ABUSER INDEFINITELY. YOUR OPTIONS FOR WORKING IN CHILD RELATED PROFESSIONS OR FOR ADOPTING OR BECOMING A FOSTER PARENT. MAY BE FORECLOSED. THAT WAS THE SITUATION THAT FACED MISTER AND MRS HUMPHRIES IN THE CASE OF HUMPHRIES VERSUS THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DECIDED BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. WELL LAW REGARDING HOW YOU GET ON THE CA SEE AYE INDEX AND HOW YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET OFF HAS CHANGED BY THAT SINCE THEN. BUT NOT BY THAT MUCH THE STANDARD NOW IS THAT ALLEGATIONS MUST BE FOUND TO BE SUBSTANTIATED FOR A PERSON TO BE PLACED ON THE LIST. BUT THE CHARGES AGAINST THE HUMPHREYS IN THAT CASE HAD BEEN FOUND TO BE SUBSTANTIATED. AND THE LAW NOW PROVIDES THAT A PERSON HAS A HAS THE RIGHT TO A HEARING TO CHALLENGE THE LISTING. A HEARING HELD BEFORE THE AGENCY THAT CREATED THE LIST AND. THE HEARING IS REQUIRED TO SATISFY DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS THAT IS THE LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE. WITH NO STATEMENT OF WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CHANGES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PROTECT THOSE WHO R. WRONGFULLY PUT ONTO THAT THE CHILD ABUSE A CENTRAL INDEX LIST FROM THE INJUSTICE OF REMAINING ON THAT LIST WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN WRONGLY ACCUSED. UNDER A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REGARDING SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCIES MORE SPECIFIC DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS CONSIDERABLY MARKET SPECIFIC DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS COMPARABLE NOT EQUAL BUT COMPARABLE TO SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS AVAILABLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ARE AVAILABLE TO PERSONS WHO ARE PUT ON THE LIST BY THOSE SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCIES. BUT THOSE PROTECTIONS ARE NOT IN THE STATUTE AND THEY WOULD NOT BE. THEY WOULD NOT APPLY TO THE PERSONS WHO WOULD BE LISTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AS PROPOSED UNDER THE BILL. NOR DO EVEN THE SETTLEMENT PROTECTIONS GUARANTEE THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN ACQUITTED OF THE CHARGES AGAINST THEM OR WHO HAS HAD THE CHARGES ADJUDICATED IN IN JUVENILE COURT PROCEEDINGS IF IF. IT INVOLVES I'VE DEPENDENCY PROCEEDINGS THAT THEY WERE NOT TRUE THAT THEY CAN BE REMOVED FROM WILLISTON IN AN EASY FASHION. THE ACLU HAS GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ANY GOVERNMENT DATABASE WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE LISTED SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF ACCUSATIONS. THESE CONCERNS ARE HEIGHTENED WHERE THE STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES FOR SUCH AS FOR CHALLENGING SUCH A LIST LISTING ARE NOT SPECIFIED. FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE FROM THE CHANGE PROPOSED IN AB TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE GREATLY OUT WHEN HIS THE BENEFIT AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE. THANK YOU EITHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OUR. FIRST OF ALL I VERY MUCH RESPECT BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE ACLU IN THEIR POSITIONS. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AT THIS TIME. I WOULD APPRECIATE THE CHAIR. ARE DISCUSSING. Y. HE HAS MADE A A YES RECOMMENDATION I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HELPED MOVE FORWARD. AND UP AND THE COMMITTEES. TO TALK ABOUT THE COMMITTEES VIEW. ON. WHAT THE PROTECTIONS ARE NOW AND I WOULD THANK THE CHAIR VERY MUCH FOR? IF HE'S ABLE TO DO THAT. YEAH I'M I'M SORRY ó OKAY SO I KNOW YOU WERE CONSULTING. THE CHIEF CONSULTANT. I THINK THE ACLU IS BROUGHT UPS FIRST OF ALL I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL ATTRACTED TO BEEN MOVED HERE. YES ARM. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. ARE TO BE ABLE TO PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE LAST. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF THE ACLU. I WOULD LIKE TO CHAIR I KNOW THE COMMITTEE HAS A DIFFERENT VIEW THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAD A DIFFERENT VIEW THAN THE ACLU. ON. WHAT PART WHAT PROTECTIONS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND AT THE LOFT CHAIR COULD ADDRESS THAT NOW OR? AFTER. THE MEMBER CLOSES AND. IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DISCUSS. WHAT PROTECTIONS THERE ARE FOR PEOPLE? GET ON THE LIST TO GET OFF THE LIST SO THANK YOU. WITH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ACTUAL LIKE. D. AUTHOR OR. OPPONENTS BUT THE THE BUILDING GO AHEAD AND TALK ABOUT PRODUCTION BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU IF E PASS IT OUT OF HERE. OF IT IS IT IS A CONCERN OF NOT ONLY CHAIR BUT IT COMMITTEE. ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE ON. WHO HAD BEEN WRONGLY? ACCUSE AND HOW TO GET THEM OFF A. GUY I THINK I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE. MISTER RON. BONTA AS BILL. WHERE IT IS A CONCERN ESPECIALLY GANG INJUNCTIONS THAT SHE SANTIAGO AND I ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH? WHERE INDIVIDUALS GET ON? AND THEY MAY HAVE JUST DRESSED. LIKE A GANG MEMBER AND THEY COME FROM VERY LITTLE CLASS AFFLUENT FAMILIES. AND THEY GET ON THE LIST BUT NEVER GET OFF AND I FOUND OUT LATER WHEN YOU'RE AND TRYING TO GO TO COLLEGE. THAT OR WHAT WHEN THEY GET ARRESTED FOR A TRAFFIC VIOLATION. THERE IS A PATTERN. OF THEM BEING PART OF A GANG THAT HAS. THAT THEIR PARENTS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT NOBODY KNEW ABOUT SO. GETTING TO MISTER CORKS CONCERNED AN ACL USED CONCERN AND IT MAY NOT BE SO THAT WE CAN. GO THROUGH A DISCUSS NOW BUT. IF THE BILL GETS OUT HERE MOVE FORWARD. THAT YOU WORK WITH THE ACLU. TO PROVIDE THE. ASSURANCES. THAT THEY NEED THAT ON THIS WALL THIS WILL CREATE MORE HARM. ON DEM WHAT YOU TRIED TO DO. WELL THAT WE TOOK WE TAKE THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE VERY SERIOUS AND TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE INNOCENT OR NOT FALSELY ACCUSED. I AND AND ALL RE ITERATE THE AIM OF THIS LEGISLATION IS REALLY UP TO PROTECT KIDS OF ARE POTENTIALLY ABUSED AND SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK. ON ENSURING THAT THOSE WERE WRONGLY ACCUSED DO NOT END UP ON THAT LIST ABU WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE IT AT THE IN A DAY. THERE IS A GRAVE NEED. TO PROTECT ON CHILDREN. FROM ABUSIVE SITUATIONS AND THERE'S A GREAT NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE KNOW WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE. AND SO THE IF THEY'RE APPLYING FOR A JOB IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE NEAR KIDS THAT WE PROTECT OTHER KIDS. AS WELL AND. AND THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT WHEN WE ENTERED THIS. IT MAKES NO SENSE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. HOW THE IN ABILITY UP TO PUT A PERSONAL DATABASE IF THEY KNOW WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN FACT? I THAT THERE IS THAT THERE IS SOMEBODY. WHO IT WHO IS ABUSING A CHILD OTHERS A PROCESS? THE CASE THAT WAS STATED. WAS IN REFERENCE TO. TO AND TO AN INDIVIDUAL BUT SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN A PROCESS PUT IN PLACE AND AND I WOULD HAND OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE TO DOES ELEVEN THAT WAS PUT PLACE FROM A MISTAKE. YOU'RE CORRECT IN AND MISTER CHAIR IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO REFER TO OUR CAPTAIN SPECIAL VICTIMS BUREAU WHO KNOWS THIS PROCESS ALL TOO WELL. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR DOING A COUPLE MINUTES TO EXPLAIN. JUST LIVING A BACKGROUND MYSELF I'VE BEEN AT THE SITE SPECIAL VICTIMS BUREAU THREE DIFFERENT TIMES THROUGHOUT MY CAREER AND I HAVE THIRTY YEARS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE MOST OF IT WITH CHILD ABUSE CASES. HARM YOU ARE CORRECT IN WHAT YOU STATED AS WITH THE PROBLEM WAS BEFORE HOWEVER IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THE LAW CHANGE SO TO THE DEFEAT XIN OF SUBSTANTIATED CASES WHICH MADE IT. NOW ALSO THAT IT HAS TO BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THEN THE VIOLATIONS THAT OCCUR. THAT WAS NOT THE DEFINITION PRIOR TO THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT OUR DEPARTMENT HAS PUT DIFFERENT PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE DEPARTMENT CHILDREN FAMILY SERVICES AND LA COUNTY. IN THE PROCESS THAT A PERSON WHO FEELS THAT THEY WERE PUT IN THE DATABASE WRONGFULLY CAN APPEAL IT. IF IN THAT FIRST APPEAL THEY ARE STILL NOT SATISFIED WILL PRIOR TO THAT OF OUR DETECTIVES IN THE MOVING FORWARD. CAN NOT ONLY. SUBMIT THE CASE TO. THE CENTRAL DATABASE BUT HAS TO BE APPROVED BY A SUPERVISOR BEFORE THE SUMMIT THE NAME. SO IT'S NOT JUST ON THE DETECTIVE SHOULDERS BUT IT ALSO HAS A SUPERVISOR REVIEW. ONCE A PERSON WANTS APPEAL IT IF THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE FIRST APPEAL WHO WILL BE DONE BY LIEUTENANT WITHIN OUR UNIT. THEN GOES TO OUR CAPTAIN. WHICH CURRENTLY IS ME I WILL THEN CONSULT NOT ONLY WITH THE. THEIR REVIEW ALL THE CASES BUT WILL CONSULT WITH COUNTY COUNCIL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON THE SAME TERMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON WHO WAS PUT INTO THE DATABASE. IS RIGHTFULLY DONE SO. AND SO WE WILL FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS THAT PRETTY MUCH DCFS FOR OUR COUNTY FOLLOWS BASED ON THE LAW. OR THE CASE THAT YOU BROUGHT FORWARD. I'M OKAY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE TELLING ME WHAT THE PROCEDURE IS IN LA COUNTY. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IN THE BILL AS REQUESTED BY THE ACLU. THAT THERE IS A PROCEDURE. AND. I'M GONNA RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR UNTIL I FIND OUT. WHAT THE PROCEDURE IS AND MAY WE JUST? CAN'T RESOLVE THAT RIGHT NOW BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS A UNIFORM PROCEDURE ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST IN LA COUNTY. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT. IS A AS FAIR PROCEDURE AT NIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS RIGHT NOW BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. AND YOU MAKE. BUT THAT'S A CONCLUSION. YES RESPECTFULLY ASK I VOTE. AND SO I BUT I THINK IS IMPORTANT THAT I SAW. AND WE PUT DALY DIEGO ON. AND A BASS BY BY SO DAMN. SHAKE HIS HEAD YES WE TALKED ABOUT COMING UP WITH SOME. VERB IF YOU'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL. GIVE US NOT ONLY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE EXPRESSIONISTIC. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK. SOME CONFIDENCE THAT YEARS AGO CROSS THE BOARD. TYPE OF UP PROCEDURES IT MAY FOLLOW EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IN LA COUNTY WHICH I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN. A DEBT WE APPRECIATED THAT WE NEED TO THE SCENE LIKE THAT DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE LAW. AND I'D ALWAYS SAY BETWEEN WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO WHEN YOU IMPLEMENTED. AND SO LET'S TRY TO RESOLVE THAT AS IT AS IT HOPEFULLY MOVES FOR. CHAIRS RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE.
