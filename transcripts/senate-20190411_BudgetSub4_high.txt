SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FOR HEARING. A TODAY'S HEARING WE WILL REVIEW BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION AND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD -- HOWEVER FIRST ON THE AGENDA -- WE HAVE A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THAT TARGETED CHILD TAX CREDIT. OF WHICH A SENATOR CABALLERO IS HERE TO PRESENT CENTER CABALLERO PLEASE [inaudible] ON WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT THAT TARGETED CHILD TAX CREDIT. ALMOST TWO MILLION CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA LIVE IN POVERTY AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE IN DEEP POVERTY. AND WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR TARGETED CHILDCARE TAX CREDIT T. CTC. WHERE ARE THESE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN THE POVERTY THERE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IN MY DISTRICT FORTY SIX THOUSAND CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY POVERTY? SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM LIVE IN ABJECT POVERTY IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE'S THREE SENATE DISTRICTS ALONE THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED CHILDREN LEAVE LIVE IN DEEP POVERTY I'M. WHO ARE THE FAMILIES IN DEEP POVERTY MANY FACE OBSTACLES TO WORK INCLUDING UNSTABLE HOUSING AND RELIABLE CHILDCARE LACK OF EDUCATION CRIMINAL RECORDS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS PROBLEMS THAT AREN'T SEVERE ENOUGH TO QUALIFY? FOR DISABILITY BENEFITS BUT THEY CAN LIMIT LIMIT STEADY WORK. MANY ARE FACED WITH A PARENT OR CHILD DISABILITY THAT MEAN MAKES A STATE OF A WORK DIFFICULT. A THIRD INCLUDE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS AND THEY ARE LIVING AT OR BELOW 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THEY'RE LIVING BELOW TWELVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR THAT'S DEEP POVERTY? AB IMAGINE TRYING TO SURVIVE ON LITTLE BIT MORE BUT LITTLE BIT UNDER THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THE TARGETED TAX CREDIT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ENDING THE POVERTY FOR THESE CHILDREN IT ADDRESSES A CORE OBJECTIVE OF THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE. TO END DEEP CHILDHOOD POVERTY AS QUICKLY AS FEASIBLE AND WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED WILL DO SO IN FOUR YEARS. ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE TOTAL A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND FAMILY RECEIVE NO BENEFITS THROUGH THE CAL WORKS OUR EITC PROGRAMS. THE REMAINING -- EL ELEVEN HAD AT AT ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND FAMILIES RECEIVE SOME BENEFITS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PUT THEM ABOVE THE POVERTY THRESHOLD. LET ME BE CLEAR THAT PROPOSED EXPANSION OF CAL WORKS YEAH I. T. C. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS CHILD TAX CREDIT PER FAMILY. ARE IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS AND I HOPE OR IMPLEMENTED BUT REACH RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THESE INVESTMENTS SUBSTANTIALLY ADDRESSED SHALLOWER POVERTY NOT DEEP POVERTY. THE TARGETED TAX CREDIT IS COMPLEMENTARY TO CAL WORKS IN THE IDC -- AND IT PROVIDES BASIC STABILITY THAT ALLOWS PARENTS TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS IF THEY ARE IF THEY'E ELIGIBLE. THE CREDIT WILL HELP PREVENT A NEW GENERATION OF CHILDREN FROM GROWING UP IN POVERTY AND WILL ALLEVIATE THE EXPOSURE TO THE TOXIC STRESS THAT IS EXPERIENCE WHEN FAMILIES DEEPLY LEVIN DE UM. IN DEEP POVERTY. THE CREDIT WILL HELP TO STABILIZE HOUSING FOR THESE FAMILIES THE MAIN REASON WHY SO MANY OF THE CHILDREN ARE ON THE STREET IS THAT THEIR PARENTS CAN'T AFFORD THE RENT -- AND THAT T. C. T. C. WILL GET THAT WILL HELP THEM TO PAY THE RENT GET INTO STABLE HOUSING AND ALLOW THE PARENTS TO RETURN TO THE WORKFORCE. FINALLY THIS WILL BOOST THE ECONOMIES OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES 80% OF THE FUNDS SUPPORTING THESE BASIC NEEDS ARE SPENT IN THE FAMILIES LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SO WE CAN. ELIMINATE DEEP POVERTY FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN BY FINDING THE TARGETED. CHILD TAX CREDIT SO IT'S UP TO US -- WITH ME HERE TODAY IS CON WE CALL AS CULTURE -- CO CHAIR OF THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE. THANK YOU SENATOR. MORNING. THANK YOU. A WORD ABOUT THE HOW THIS WOULD BE -- ADMINISTERED TO THE MINISTER BY FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OF THE CLAIMED ON A PERSONAL INCOME TAX RETURN. CLAIMING THE CREDIT WOULD INVOLVE TWO SIMPLE STEPS. THE NET RESOURCES OF THE FAMILY BOTH OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESOURCES WOULD BE POUT CALCULATED. A BASED ON THE AGAIN THEY'RE BOTH PROBABLY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BENEFITS. AND THEN THOSE NET RESOURCES WOULD BE COMPARED 250% OF THE CALIFORNIA POVERTY LINE. IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH THEY RESIDE THE CAT CALIFORNIA POVERTY LINE IS A STEP FURTHER THAN WHAT THE CENSUS BUREAU PROVIDES BECAUSE IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT -- THE THE SPECIFIC COST OF HOUSING IN CHILDCARE ANOTHER COSTS IN THE SPECIFIC. COUNTY IN THE CREDIT IS SIMPLY THAN EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO I'D LIKE TO JUST EMPHASIZE THE TWO MOST CRITICAL POINTS. ABOUT THE TARGET A CHILD TAX CREDIT. THE TARGET A CHILD TAX CREDIT IS NOT IN PLACE OF CAL WORKS IN CALLOUS EXPANSION E. I. T. C. IN THE E. I. T. C. EXPANSION. BOTH OF THOSE VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AS PRIORITIES -- BY THE TASK FORCE. TO THE TARGET A CHILD TAX CREDIT IS NOT IN PLACE OF THOSE BUT NOR ARE THEY IN PLACE. OF THE TARGETED TODD THE CHILD TAX CREDIT THESE SERVE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. THOSE THOSE BENEFITS VENN EITC AND CAL WORKS ARE CRUCIAL. BUT THEY GENERALLY DON'T A DRESS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DEEP POVERTY IN THE STATE AND THE SENATOR IS INDICATED -- THE NUMBERS JUST REPRESENTED ED IN EACH OF YOUR DISTRICTS WHICH IS ABOUT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND CHILDREN -- FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND FAMILIES ARE IN DEEP POVERTY. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WHOSE NEEDS WOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE TARGETED CHILD TAX CREDIT AND REALLY ONLY BY THE TARGET THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. SO THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE FACING. SONIC INSTABILITY IN TERMS OF ACTIONS -- HOUSING AND SECURITY -- IN AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS -- BROKEN CARS EXPIRING TELEPHONE CONTRACTS -- I ON UNRELIABLE CHILD CARE. AND SO THE PROBLEM IS UNLESS WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES OF BASIC STABILITY. THESE ARE FOLKS THAT CAN'T BEGIN TO CLIMB THE ECONOMIC LADDER AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CAL WORKS IN THE I. T. C.. WE'VE GOT AT LEAST A PROVIDE THAT STABILITY SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO TO USE THAT AS A FOUNDATION. TO THEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CAL WORKS AND AND THE I. T. C. [inaudible] THE ALONG THAT SAME LINE THE PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR. TAX CREDIT. TO FAMILIES IS AN EXCELLENT PROPOSAL AND AND AND WE STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR. DAD ADDRESSES SHALLOW POVERTY. AND THAT ADDRESSES THE FOLKS THAT ARE NEAR POVERTY SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES PEOPLE. WHO PEOPLE OVER IN DEEP POVERTY THAT AVERAGE BENEFIT JUST TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM WHERE THEY ARE? TO ABOVE THE DEEP POVERTY LINE WILL BE ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. AND SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY COGNIZANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE OTHER BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF DEEP. POVERTY IN THE STATE. THE THE FINAL POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT THIS IS THE THIS OBVIOUSLY ACOSTA ISSUE. LONG TERM THIS PAYS FOR ITSELF MANY TIMES OVER. SHORT TERM THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME COSTS. BUT IT'S IT'S REALLY I THINK VERY SIMILAR TO IF IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A OF BRIDGE. EARTHQUAKE SAFE -- IF. AND KNOCKS A HOLE IN THE ROOF. BOTH ISSUES OF DEFECTS THOSE THINGS. AND THE THE ISSUE IS YOU PROBABLY DO BECAUSE IT'S A PRIORITY FOR YOU. AND SO I THINK ONE THING THAT'S CRUCIAL IS THIS IS LOOKED AT IS OUR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IN THE STATE. A SUFFICIENT PRIORITY TO SAY WE NEED TO DO IT TO TO SPEND THE MONEY SHORT TERM. IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LONG TERM BENEFITS OF THOSE PARENTS BEING ABLE TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT STABILITY AND THE CHILDREN BEING ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THEIR ENTER NOT A HOMELESSNESS THE REALITY IS. THEY'RE NOT ABLE. TO ADJUST THE JUST THE MARTELLO FROM WESTERN CENTER WAS THE CHAIR OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE. CHECK A MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST GIVE OUR FLOW WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND ALSO ON THAT THE TEAM CHILDREN OUT OF A PARTY TASK FORCE. MY JOB TODAY IS JUST TO BRIEFLY REMIND YOU WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE POVERTY AMONG CHILDREN -- AS YOU KNOW DE POVERTY HAS AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON CHILDREN A NEGATIVE IMPACT -- PREVENTING THEM FROM PARTICIPATING IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND IN THEIR SCHOOLS FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HIGH NUMBERS OF KIDS ANTI POVERTY. THE ENTIRE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT IS COMPROMISED THE INVESTMENTS THAT OUR STATE AKES AN EDUCATION ARE COMPROMISED. AT THE INVESTMENTS THAT OUR STATE MAKES IN HEALTH FOR THESE CHILDREN ARE ALSO COMPROMISE BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY IMPACTS CHILDREN'S PARTICIPATION IN SCHOOL. BUT ALSO -- INC S.. INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THESE CHILDREN WILL SUFFER FROM THE TOXIC STRESS CAUSED BY DEEP POVERTY TOXIC STRESS HAS BOTH LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM CONSEQUENCES -- INCLUDING DEPRESSION. THEY'VE IDENTIFIED DEPRESSION AMONG INFANTS. AS YOUNG AS FOUR MONTHS OLD. AND THEY EXPERIENCE BASICALLY DESPERATION. FOUR MONTHS OLD -- THE LACK OF BASIC NEEDS CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY -- TO MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH -- CRISIS. AND AS YOU'VE PROBABLY READ -- MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH AT PROBLEMS AND AND MATERNAL -- DEPRESSION IS ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS -- TO CHILDREN NOT BEING READY FOR SCHOOL BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS DON'T INTERACT WITH THEM AND YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN. ARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE CHILDREN NOTHING ABLE TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF YOUR CHILDREN -- AND AND WHAT KIND OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT WOULD CREATE AND SO DISTANCE CRATES BETWEEN THE CHILDREN AND THE MOTHER THEY DON'T READ TO THEM THEY DON'T SING TO THEM NO CODDLED EARLY HOLD THEM AS AS MUCH -- AND THE DATA IS THERE TO SHOW THAT -- I DO HAVE ALSO A DOCUMENT THAT I WILL EMAIL THE COMMITTEE WITH CITATIONS FOR EACH OF THE POINTS I MAKING. DEEP POVERTY IS SO DANGEROUS TO CHILDREN AT THAT ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT -- GROWING UP ANTI POVERTY MORE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED A CHILD AND THEIR LIFE CHANCES THE NEONATAL. EXPOSURE TO COCAINE. THE POVERTY IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IT'S THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND AND THE MOST AMAZING THING AS BEFORE TODAY WE'VE HAD PLANS FOR HOW TO ADDRESS THE POVERTY WITHIN POCKETS. OF THE COMMUNITY THERE WAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR LAST YEAR IN SUPPORT OF ENDING THE POVERTY FOR THE COUCH PROGRAM -- IN SB NINE EIGHTY TWO AND WE APPRECIATED THAT BILL -- AND THERE HAS BEEN MOVEMENT AND REDUCING AT THE POVERTY WITHIN CAL WORKS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT A PROPOSAL HAS COME FORWARD AND SAID WE WILL ANDY POVERTY FOR ALL CHILDREN. IT'S A PRIORITY OF OUR STATE TO DO SO -- AS AS A BODY ELECTRIC ELECTED BODY BUT ALSO AS AS A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WE CAN CONTINUE TO POINT OUR FINGERS AT THE PARENTS TO SAY YOU OUGHT TO BE DOING MORE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS BUT EACH TIME WE DO THAT UNTIL THE KIDS ARE OUT OF THE POVERTY. FOUR FINGERS ARE POINTING BACK AT US. SO THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SAY TO THE CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE IN YOU NO MATTER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU GROW UP IN -- WE BELIEVE YOU HAVE A FUTURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO [inaudible] IN CLOSING. AND I LIKE TO SAY THAT SOME OF THESE KIDS HOPEFULLY. ONE DAY WE'LL COMES TO TO BE HERE TO BE WHERE I'M SIT SITTING OR WHERE YOU'RE SITTING. AND A LOOK BACK AT TODAY AND IF WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES THE LOOK BACK AND LOOK AT THE VOTES FROM TODAY -- AND FROM THE DECISIONS OF THIS BODY AND KNOW THAT THOSE DECISIONS HELP THEM GET TO WHERE THEY ARE. IF WE DIDN'T MAKE THIS CHOICE AND THEY SUFFERED GREATLY IF THEIR SIBLINGS WERE STUCK IN POVERTY IF THEIR LIFE CHANCES -- ARE TRUNCATED OR THEY EXPERIENCE DEBILITATING AND PAINFUL LIFELONG DISEASES BECAUSE OF THE TALKS EXPRESS EXPERIENCE IN DEEP POVERTY. THE LHASA REMEMBER WHO'S. WHO'S VOTE I WASN'T CATH I'M FOR THAT TO BE PREVENTED. I KNOW AS AS SOMEBODY WHO'S A MYSELF EXPERIENCE CHILDHOOD DEPRIVATION OF OF BASIC NEEDS. I HAVE GONE BACK TO SEE WHO VOTED AGAINST MY INTERESTS AS A CHILD. AND I WOULD EXPECT THE SAME OF THE CHILDREN COMING UP TODAY TO DO THAT TO DO THAT AS WELL. SO I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU -- I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY BELIEVES -- WE CAN DO AND AND IF WE CAN DO IT AND WE SHOULD DO IT AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- WE HAVE PUBLIC THE QUESTION. COMMA SIR SENATOR [inaudible] THE APPORTIONMENT. OF THE CREDIT FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WILL THAT BE TO A CUSTODIAL PARENT OR THE FAMILY STRUCTURES ARE VERY. ILL DEFINED NOW. STILL HOW HOW IS IT GOING TO BE DECIDED WHO GETS THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THEN HOW DO WE ASSURETHAT THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CHILD'S. FUTURE. NOT JUST THE THE PARENT THE WHATEVER CUSTODIAN. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS ANOTHER IS ANOTHER BILL. THIS ONE IS IS A TAX CREDIT. THAT IS THAT GOES TO THE CUSTODIAL PARENT. IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS FILING THE TAX RETURN OKAY AND SO THAT'S THE ANSWER. AND YOU JUST HOPE THEY WILL USE IT FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED THEM WELL YOU KNOW WHAT -- I I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH THESE FAMILIES IS THERE'S A LOT OF CHAOS -- AND THE CHAOS IS CREATED BY THE FACT THAT THERE IS THERE ISN'T THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY COMING IN TO HELP THEM -- STABILIZE THEIR THEIR THEIR SITUATION AND SO -- WHAT THIS DOES IS IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IT IT IS A SIZEABLE CHECK FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE RENT -- YOU KNOW GET INTO HOUSING IF THEY DON'T HAVE IT. MANY OF THESE FAMILIES -- OUR OUR ARE ARE HOMELESS -- OR THEY'RE STAYING IN SOMEBODY'S GARAGE -- THEY'RE NOT IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY ALL THE BILLS AND STILL MEET THE MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR OF THEIR CHILDREN AND SO. BY PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE. TO GET A CHECK THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME STABILITY FOR THEM WE BELIEVE THOUGH IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE OUT THERE IT'S SO IT IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE OTHER SERVICES ARE PREPARED. TO WELCOME THE MEN AND TO HAVE THEM BE A PART OF THEIR PROGRAMS SO AND SO WE CAN WE CAN WORK AT AT LINING UP THE SERVICES SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT -- WANTS PEOPLE TO HAVE A STABLE HOUSING AND THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET SOME OF THEIR BASIC NEEDS THAT THEY THEN CAN GET INTO THESE PROGRAMS. CAN I ADD ONE ONE THING SO PLEASE -- YOU KNOW WHAT THE TASK FORCE YOU CAN IMAGINE GOD VOLUMINOUS STUDIES AND DATA AND MOST OF IT ARE THINGS THAT YOU KIND OF KNOW ALREADY. THERE'S A LOT OF DATA. THE THE DATA THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST. WAS HOW CLEAR THE EVIDENCE IS. THAT WHEN PARENTS HAVE ADDITIONAL MONEY. THEY SPEND IT ON THEIR KIDS. AND IT'S IT IS. ANY PERCEPTION THAT THE PEOPLE IN DEEP POVERTY -- DON'T SPEND IT THAT WAY IS INCORRECT BECAUSE THE DATA SHOWS VERY CLEARLY. THAT THEY THEY SPEND IT ON THEIR KIDS PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THEIR KIDS AND BY THE WAY THEY ALSO SPEND IT IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WITH NOT BEEN DEFINED YET WHAT THE PROPOSAL OF THE FIVE HUNDRED IS NOW THAT. WE HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVEN GOT THE SPECIFICS ARE PRESENTED TO US YEAH [inaudible] THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL THANK. THE THREE OF YOU FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TO OUR ATTENTION MR CALLS I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR MANY YEARS AND YOU -- ARE TO BE CONGRATULATED AND ADMIRED FOR THE TIME EFFORT AND PASSION YOU PUT INTO CALIFORNIA'S NEEDIEST TICKET AGE CHILDREN. THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO ADJUSTED ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SCENARIOS NOT HERE IN TERMS OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS HOW DOES THAT WORK. OF THIS SHE MAY MAYBE. IT WILL THEY REALLY RICH COME COMMENT RESPOND [inaudible] TYPICALLY THE ALL RIGHT DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT THAT'S GOOD -- I DON'T SEE THEM HERE -- ALL RIGHT IN IN THE NEXT IS -- IT'LL BE PHASED IN IS IT TO OUR NINETY MILLION IS HIS FIRST YEAR COSTS WHAT WHAT DO YOU TO SPEED THE OUT YOUR COSTS TO BE. I'M YEAH THAT THAT THE TASK FORCE FOR ALL THE PROPOSAL'S WRAPPED IT UP OVER. WRAPPED UP THE CUSTOMER TEN YEARS IN THE FIRST TWO WERE. DESIGNED TO FIRST OF ALL BE WITH. DURABLE IN IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET -- THE WITH THE WITH THE IDEA THAT DID THAT AFTER TWENTY TWENTY THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF TAX REFORM ISSUES OTHER THINGS. SO THE FIRST YEAR COST IS TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION PLUS. THEY'LL BE ADMINISTERED CLASSES FOR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IN ORDER FOR THEM. TO RAMP UP THERE'S A PLACE HOLDER IN TERMS OF THE COST OF I BELIEVE THREE MILLION ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY THERE COST MAY BE. AND IT MAY BE BEYOND THAT TO RAMP UP THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN THE OUT REACH IS GOING TO BE CRUCIAL TO GET PEOPLE TO SIGN UP FOR NEWS TWENTY MILLION IN. TO DO THE SAME WAY I TO SEE REQUIRED. THE REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE AND GETTING THEM TO SIGN UP THIS IS. THIS IS THE SAME THING SO THE THE THE SECOND YEAR COST AND SO THAT'S THE ONLY COVERS FOR THE FIRST YEAR. I CHILDREN ZERO TO THREE IN ORDER TO KEEP THE OVERALL COST OUT AND RICH IN INITIALLY. WHEN FULLY UTILIZE TEN YEARS OUT -- WHEN AT THAT POINT YOU'D HAVE? A NORM IS COST SAVINGS FROM IT WOULD BE TWO POINT FOUR BILLION. BUT AT THAT POINT THE RETURNS FROM IT IN TERMS OF REDUCED OTHER KINDS OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- TAX RECEIPTS FROM THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE RECEIVED SERVICES IN THE PAST WOULD FAR OUTWEIGH THE THE DIRECT BUDGETARY COST. IF I MIGHT ALSO JUST THAT I KNOW IT'S NOT THE CUSTOM TO CONSIDER THAT SAVINGS PRESSURES OF THESE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS BUT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT YOU HAVE PRODUCED TRANSCEIVER SO INCREASE SCHOOL PARTICIPATION AND FUNDING COMING FROM THAT. YOU HAVE -- REDUCE HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS OF CHILDREN -- BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM AS A GROWING TO ADULTS AND AND NOT HAVING LONG TERM IMPACT OF THAT -- DE POVERTY AS WELL -- FEWER PEOPLE ACTUALLY THE THE FEWER YEARS YOU SPEND IN THE PROPERTIES A CHILD THE LESS LIKELY YOU ARE TO IT TO BE ANTI POVERTY AS AN ADULT AND TO RELY ON PUBLIC BENEFITS AS AN ADULT. SO I RECOGNIZE THESE ARE MANY FOUR YEARS OUT OF BUT I LIKE TO CALL THEM SAVINGS PRESSURES -- THAT WE WOULD EXPECT SAVINGS AND OTHER PLACES. MADAM CHAIR OF MR SEVEN JOB IF IF I COULD ASK IF WE HAVE SOME. LA -- DEPARTMENT FINANCE NOT NOT TODAY OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT HERE. BUT OF COMMON FOR US THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. OKAY THANK YOU WILL GO. JUST ONE MORE UP QUESTION. WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF HOW YOU WILL OR HOW THIS PROGRAM. WILL HELP THOSE FAMILIES GET THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT. BRINGING SOME STABILITY TO THE FAMILY CLEARLY. JUST THIS IN THEIR LIVES IS NOT GOING TO TAKE THEM. OUT OF THE ALL THE ISSUES THAT THEY'VE BEEN FACING OBVIOUSLY FOR AT LEAST SOME NUMBER OF YEARS. SO THEY'VE BEEN A VERY CRITICAL CRITICAL. SITUATION. IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF HERE SOME. FUNDING TO HELP YOU. HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THEY REALLY GET THE FULL SERVICES? THAT'S REALLY IT A CRITICAL IN GREAT QUESTION -- AND IT WHAT IT GOES TO IT IS THAT. THE SERVICES AND SUPPORT THAT PEOPLE NEED HAS TO BE COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED. AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE PAST. IS THAT WHAT THAT ISN'T THE WAY WE'VE WE'VE GENERALLY OPERATED. AND IT ACTUALLY IT IT ALSO GOES BACK TO THE POINT I WAS MAKING WITH REGARD TO CAL WORKS IN THE I. T. C.. AND THE TARGET A CHILD TAX CREDIT THESE THINGS WORK TOGETHER WE CAN'T JUST DO ONE THING. IT'S A TOP RATED COMPREHENSIVE COORDINATED APPROACH SELF THIS IS PART OF THE CONTINUUM THAT THAT STARTS WITH WITH HEALTH CARE AND PRENATAL CARE. HOME VISITING PROGRAMS CHILDCARE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ALL THESE THINGS HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER INCLUDING THE COORDINATION OF THESE PROGRAMS THROUGH THINGS LIKE PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHERE PEOPLE ARE? WITH AN ABLE TO TAKE A GIVEN ACCESS TO THE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS THAT THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER SERVICES. WHILE THEY'RE BOUNCING IN AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. FOR EXAMPLE. SO BUT BUT AS PART OF THAT WHEN WHEN WHEN THEY'RE REACHED OUT TO TO GET INTO SIGNED UP SIGN UP. THE WAY THIS YEAR. WOULD BE WORKING AND SHOULD BE WORKING. IS THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BE MADE AWARE OF THE OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. IN TERMS OF CHILDCARE AND CHAU% AND AND AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SO THAT'S ALSO THIS PART OF THE THE OUTRAGE WHEN YOU'RE GETTING PEOPLE TO SIGN UP. SO IF I COULD AS WELL ON THE THE GROUP THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE LISTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE IS THAT -- IS THAT THE THE TASK FORCE WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY TO PUT TOGETHER -- THE STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING POVERTY AND THEY THEY THEY ALSO -- HIGHLIGHTED. WHICH ONES WOULD HAVE THE MOST IMPACT ON THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF POVERTY AND I ON ANOTHER BILL THAT I'M WORKING ON A WILL START TO SET SOME -- GOALS. SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE DEEP POVERTY WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND POVERTY WITHIN ANOTHER PERIOD OF TIME JUST LIKE WE DO OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND AND A REPORT THAT WOULD COME BACK BACK BY ANY BY IN A LITTLE BY IN LIEU OF THE BY AND BY. I ANNUALLY THAT'S RIGHT IT IS BI ANNUALLY THAT THAT -- THAT TELLS US HOW WE'RE DOING. AND THEY CAN GIVE US RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO MAYBE MAKE SOME OF THE LINKAGES AND WHAT'S WORKING IN SME COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT KIND OF THING SO WE'RE THIS IS. THIS IS REALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BE MUCH MORE ORGANIZED AND DISCIPLINED ABOUT HOW WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND TO DO IT -- OFF THE BILL THAT OFF THE WORK THAT THAT'S BEEN DONE OVER THE PAST -- EIGHTEEN MONTHS THERE ARE SO THAT THAT THAT THIS IS A GROUP HAS BEEN MEETING AND SO -- OUR YOUR POINT IS REALLY WELL TAKEN IN THE END TO JUST -- THROW MONEY AT SOMETHING DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO LINK AND MAKE IT MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE. AND I KNOW YOU SAID I THINK THIS IS A GREAT KIND OF ADDITION TO MY THINKING I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT. THE PLATFORM FOR SAY THAT WE MIGHT HAVE SOMEBODY GO THROUGH AND ALL THE WORK WE'VE DONE TO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU'RE APPLYING ONLINE FOR SCHOOL MEALS YOU GET TO LEARN ABOUT MEDI CAL AND SNAP. OR YOU'RE BUYING ONLINE FOR THESE OTHER PLACES WE'VE DONE THE WORK TO CONNECT THOSE AT LEAST LIKE WITHIN AN ONLINE PORTAL. SO WE'L BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT ABOUT THAT WE WORK ON THE TRAILER BILL FOR THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT INCLUDES THAT VISION OF YOU KNOW NO WRONG DOOR. AND SO I I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT THAT -- QUESTION IS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. UP AND NOTHING ELSE IS IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TODAY REALLY APPRECIATE [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'M SORRY THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER FOLKS PUBLIC COMMENT ANYBODY.

WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL [inaudible] FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THESE ARE CRITICAL RESOURCES. FOR A PROJECT THAT'S THAT'S ON TRACK OKAY. THE AND I'VE STILL GOT LOTS TO LEARN HOW DOES THIS INTERACT WITH THIS GIRL -- WE PROVIDE SOME DATA DIRECTLY -- TO FISCALE IN TERMS OF WHAT CASH RECEIPTS ARE COMING IN BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S NOT AT A DIRECT. INTEGRATION WITH THAT SYSTEM OKAY. MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND I THOUGHT FISCAL ALWAYS GOING TO BE SORT OF THE OVERALL. BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM FOR THE STATE IS THAT IS THAT WRONG. SO THIS SYSTEM IS JUST FOR THE TAX ADMINISTRATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE LIKE THE THE BUDGETING PROCESS AND COST FOR THE DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE. WITH THIS SYSTEM. BASICALLY BRINGS IN REVENUE RIGHT THAT'S OKAY SO REVENUE COMES IN. AND THEN SOMEBODY SOMETHING ACCOUNTS FOR THAT REVENUE RIGHT CORRECT AND BALANCES THE BOOKS YES RIGHT. AND SO. IN IN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE IS IT FISCAL THE DOES THAT. SO WE'RE TRACKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER LEVEL RIGHT ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITH OUR TAX AND FEE PAYERS. AND THE INFORMATION IS THEN PROVIDED AT HIGHER LEVEL TO OUR FISCALE -- TO OUR STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. AND THROUGH THE FISCAL SYSTEM SO THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT'S PROVIDED -- IS A HIGHER LEVEL RIGHT IT'S A GOOD THE GROSS AMOUNT WE'VE GOT XML THAT LEAVE. RECEIVED FROM WHATEVER IT MAY BE ONE TAX SOURCE. OF AN IN HOUSE THAT INTEGRATION AND AND HOUSE OF PROGRESSING SURE IT'S IT'S GOING -- MY NAME IS JAY SMALL AND THE CFO CDT EFFECT SO THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS CROSSES OUR COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM SO WE COLLECT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND WE ALSO DIRECTLY DISTRIBUTE AROUND FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TO A THOUSAND PLACES JURISDICTIONS. SO THAT IS OUR COLLECTION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FISCAL OWL IS OUR BOOKKEEPING AND EXPENSE SYSTEM SO THE MONEY COMES IN THAT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS. RIGHT NOW IT'S OVER FIFTY FIVE BILLINGS OF A COUPLE ROLL OUT FOR CROSS THAT GETS RECORDED INTO FISTS GAL. AND OF RECORD SO THEY THEY DO INTEGRATE WE ARE THAT WE DO HAVE A PROJECT TO LINK THE TWO SYSTEMS TOGETHER WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE THE NUMBER REVENUES WE HAVE. AND HOW'S IT GOING. I'M IT'S GOING WELL IT'S GOING WELL I MEAN. WE STILL WE'VE CLOSED A MONTH IN FISCALE -- THERE STILL IS TEETHING GOING ON TO BE HONEST -- BUT WE WERE WORKING CLOSELY WITH BOTH CROSS SANTA SCALE TEAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT LINK -- DOES HAPPEN -- AND HAPPEN SMOOTHLY. THAT LINK WILL -- SHOULD COMPLETE IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR. BUT THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE PERSONAL INCOME TAX IS THAT RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY. AND THEN THERE'S A REASON THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TO COLLECT DIFFERENT KINDS OF TAXES -- SO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WANTED. PRINTER SEX BOARD IS THE ONE ADMINISTERS THE TAX SO THEIR SYSTEM. THE SEPARATE THAN CVT IT PAYS FOR ADMINISTERING -- THE OTHER PROGRAMS [inaudible] SO. AGAIN YOU HAVE TO INDULGE MY NEWNESS OF IGNORANCE. IT WOULD BE SMARTER IF WE WERE STARTING OVER AGAIN THEY HAVE THEM COMBINED. NOT SURE I'M IN A POSITION TO OPINE ON BUT I CAN TELL YOU -- JUST HAVING BEEN AT THE DEPARTMENT TAX AND FEE FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS MYSELF -- IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLEX -- THE NUMBER OF TAX PROGRAMS THAT WE IMPLEMENT -- I CAN ONLY IMAGINE OUR COUNTERPARTS THAT FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAVE THE SAME I THINK. LIKE MANY THINGS CALIFORNIA IS JUST SO BIG AND COMPLEX AND SO MUCH REVENUE COMING IN -- BUT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE ACTUALLY TO HAVE -- SEPARATE ROB REPORTING ENTITIES BUT SURF CHRISTINE LA L. -- SENATOR -- THE NOTION OF TAX AGENCY CONSOLIDATION HAS BEEN DISCUSSED OF RADIUM POINTS OVER THE YEARS AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU SOME OF THE SORT OF MATERIALS WE PUT TOGETHER IN THE PAST ON THAT. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU -- DIMENSION ONE IT IS ONE OF THE GOALS -- IS -- TO IMPROVE THE USER EXPERIENCE CORRECT -- OR FOR A FROM A TAXPAYERS POINT OF VIEW MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT CORRECT CAN YOU TELL ME. WIRE HOW THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. SO A NUMBER OF THE SERVICES THAT THE CDT IF THEY HAD PROVIDED IN THE PAST WERE DONE. EITHER BY PAPER OR VISITING AT A FIELD OFFICE -- A HELLO MUCH OF THE CAPABILITIES OF THE SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR THE TAX AND FEE PAIR TO GO ON TO OUR TAXPAYER PORTAL. AND CONDUCT A LOT OF THEIR THEIR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ONLINE -- IN SOME CASES GETTING APPROVAL AUTOMATED -- IN ROUTE IMMEDIATELY SO -- THAT ALSO WITH OUR RETURN FILING CAPABILITY -- MUCH OF THE RETURNS THAT ARE PROCESSED FOR THE DEPARTMENT ARE STILL BEING HANDLED BY PAPER -- THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO ALLOW ALL TAX AND PREPARES TO FILE ONLINE -- AND MAKE PAYMENTS ONLINE. THAT BY ITSELF DOESN'T MEAN IT'S USER FRIENDLY. THE FACT THAT IT'S GOING ONLINE CORRECT I MEAN. YEAH SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE. THE PAPER TRAIL IS EASIER -- DEPENDING ON WHAT THE SYSTEM IS THAT YOU USING SO SURE HOW ARE YOU INCORPORATING. AND MAKING SURE IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE USER FRIENDLY NOT ONLY. MAKING IT ONLINE SURE SO WE DID -- SEVERAL USABILITY STUDIES AND FOCUS GROUPS ONCE WE HAD A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO ALLOW -- THE PUBLIC TO START USING OUR SYSTEM AND THEN FROM THOSE USABILITY FOCUS GROUPS -- WE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE USABILITY OF THE SYSTEM AND WHAT WE NOTED WAS -- AFTER WE MADE THOSE USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS -- THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY FOR E. FILING -- WAS EASIER IN THE SENSE THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WAS TAKING OUR TAXPAYERS TO FILE THE RETURN. I DECREASED FROM A WAS IN OUR PRIOR SYSTEM. AND WE DID IF I COULD ADD TO THAT OUR USABILITY GROUPS WERE. AT DIFFERENT TYPES OF TAXPAYERS TO SO SMALL LEARNS TAX PREPARERS -- WE REALLY TRY TO GET AS MUCH FEEDBACK -- FROM THAT THOSE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF TAXPAYERS THAT WEEK. HE EXPLAINED A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE VENDOR -- WHAT THE VENDORS GETTING OF PAID? THE COMPANY YEAH SURE SO IT'S A FIXED PRICE CONTRACT. FOR EIGHTY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE WAY THE COMPENSATION FOR THE VENDOR WORKS. IS THE VENDOR DOES NOT GET PAID UNTIL THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED THE SYSTEM. AS WELL AS REALIZE SOME BENEFIT OR REVENUE INCREASE FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND STATE. AND SO -- THE STATE DOES TO A COMPONENTS IN PLACE ALLOW US FOR US TO TO MAKE COMPENSATION TO THE VENDOR BUT IT BUT IT'S CAPPED AT THE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS AWARDED BACK IN AUGUST OF SIXTY WILL GET SOMETHING BETWEEN NOW AND YES YEAH FOR EACH. BABIES ARE RELEASE -- THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION FOR THAT PARTICULAR IMPLEMENTATION. WHICH WILL REALLY KNOW HOW SUCCESSFUL YOUR UNTIL. WHEN YOU START SAYING? THE REVENUE WILL WORD STARTING TO TRACK REVENUE INCREASE -- IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT FIRST RELEASE. SO YOU HAVE A IDEAS YOU GO YES ME. MORE NO MORE QUESTIONS OKAY I WOULD GO TO PUBLIC.

IS A BACK UP. IT'S BOTH IT SAYS STORY. ACTIVE STORAGE AND BACKUP AND RECOVERY. GOT IT OKAY PUBLIC COMMENT. MOTION MADE ROLL CALL PLEASE. SENATOR RAZA HI SIR NIELSEN. THEY'RE A MEMBER [inaudible] OKAY. NOW WE GO ON TO ISSUE THIRTEEN SEVERAL BILLS. WITH RESPECT TO THE NEW TESTAMENT YEAH [inaudible] OKAY. THIS IS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. EXPANSION [inaudible] GOOD MORNING -- OKAY. SORRY. YOU GO FIRST. OKAY. YOU ASKED US TO PREPARE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE STATE'S IN EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND SO WE PREPARE THIS HAND OUT TO EXPLAIN. SOME OF IT. THE CREDITS HISTORY IN WHAT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ARE A EVALUATION OF THE OKAY. PAGE ONE OF THE HANDOUT SHOWS THE GRAPH OF WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL THE VOLCANO CHART WHICH SHOWS OF HOW THE CURRENT FEDERAL. EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IS STRUCTURED. SO ON THIS GRAPH THE HORIZONTAL AXIS SHOWS THAT THE THE TAX FILERS INCOME BEFORE CALCULATING YOUR AND INCOME TAX CREDIT. IN THE VERTICAL AXIS SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF THE E. I. T. C. THAT THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. FOR SO AS YOU CAN SEE ARM. AT VERY LOW LEVELS OF INCOME. WE'RE UP FOR IN WHAT WE CALL THE PHASE IN RANGE WHERE THE CREDIT AMOUNT IS INCREASING AS THE FILERS EARNED INCOME INCREASES. AND EARNED INCOME ISN'T THEIR TOTAL INCOME IS JUST TO FIND AS THEIR WAGES AND SALARIES ARE IN THERE'S PLUS THEIR SELF EMPLOYMENT INCOME SO ITS INCOME THAT COMES FROM WORK. AS OPPOSED TO COMING FROM OTHER SOURCES. SO. UP THROUGH IN INCOME LEVEL OF ABOUT. FOURTEEN THOUSAND THE AMOUNT OF THE A. T. C. INCREASES AS THE FILINGS INCOME INCREASES AT A RATE OF ABOUT 40%. SO THAT AT THE THE P. E. I. T. C. LEVEL WHICH YOU REACH AN INCOME OF ABOUT FOR A LITTLE OVER. FOURTEEN THOUSAND THE EITC AMOUNT IS A LITTLE BIT BELOW. SIX THOUSAND OKAY SO THEN THERE'S OF WHAT WE CALL A FLAT RANGE OF THE A. T. C.. ARM BACK UP. THIS GRAPH SHOWS WHAT A FILER. A SINGLE PARENT WITH TWO ELIGIBLE DEPENDENT CHILDREN WILL GET. FOR FILERS WITH ONE DEPENDENT CHILD -- ELIGIBLE DEPENDENT THESE AMOUNTS ARE SOMEWHAT LOWER FOR THREE EITHER SOMEWHAT HIGHER. IF THE FILE HAS NO DEPENDENCE NO ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS IT'S A LOT LOWER. BUT FOR SIMPLICITY AND TO AVOID CLUTTERING UP THE GRAPH WE ONLY SHOWED IT. FOR TWO PEOPLE WITH TWO KIDS TO SHOW HOW THE BUT BASICALLY HOW THE FEDERAL EITC WAS BECAUSE A QUESTION SO I DON'T GET. FURTHER LOST -- I'M LOOKING AT THE CHART. AND I THINK YOU SAID THAT -- RIGHT THERE YES -- OKAY BECAUSE ARE REVEALED THAT IS THE QUESTION THERE WE GO. OKAY. PERFECT NO I'M NOT AS OKAY. OKAY SO AFTER YOU HIT THE PEAK THERE'S WHAT'S CALLED A FLAT RANGE OF THE A. T. C. GOES UP TO ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. OF INCOME AT WHICH YOU KNOW. SO IN THAT WHOLE RANGE BETWEEN ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THOUSAND OF THE FILES FEDERAL EITC AMOUNT IS THE SAME. THEN THE CREDIT STARTS TO PHASE OUT AS THE FILERS INCOME INCREASES AND SO. AS THE GRAPH SHOWS IT PROPORTIONALLY GOES YOU KNOW GETS LOWER AND LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL YOU HIT IN INCOME OF ABOUT FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AT WHICH POINT YOUR INELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT. SO THAT'S AGAINST. HER ON TO WHICH THE STATE HIS. YOU KNOW CRAFTED IT. TEEN LOOKS LIKE [inaudible] AND SO THIS CHART HAS THE SAME. SAME SCALE AS THE CHART ON PAGE. ONE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S GEARED -- MUCH MORE TOWARD PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST AT THE LOWEST END OF THE INCOME SCALE THERE [inaudible] SO. UP THROUGH AN AGAIN WE'RE SHOWING IT OUT FOR A FILE WITH TWO DEPENDENTS. UP THROUGH AN INCOME OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS ABOUT HALF OF THE THE INCOME IN THE FEDERAL PHASE IN RANGE. IT INCREASES IT ALMOST THE SAME RATE THE FEDERAL EITC DOES IT'S AT A RATEOF 34% COMPARED 240% FOR THE FEDERAL. SO WHAT IN INCOME OF SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. A STATE EITC FILE WOULD COLLECT A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BUT AT THAT POINT. THE STATE CREDIT STARTS TO PHASE OUT AT THE SAME RATE THAT IF THEY USED IN. SO BY THE TIME YOU'RE IN INCOME AROUND FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS THE THE END OF THE FEDERAL PHASE IN RANGE THE STATE CREDIT IS GOING. TO ZERO AGAIN THIS CRAFT IS NOT SHOW WOULD A FILING WITH ONE DEPENDENT OR A FILE WITH THREE OR MORE DEPENDENTS GETS. ITS SLIGHTLY MORE GENEROUS THAN THIS FOR FILING WITH THREE OR MORE DEPENDENTS IT'S CONSIDERABLY LESS GENEROUS FOR FILER WITH ONE DEPENDENT. A WE DO SHOW WAIT A FILE WITH NO DEPENDENTS GETS IN AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A AT THAT POINT IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH -- THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE FEDERAL CREDIT DOES THE AMOUNTS FOR FILERS WITH NO DEPENDENTS ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THE FILE THE AMOUNTS FOR FILERS WHO HAVE DEPENDENTS. ALSO THE WHEN THE STATE CREDIT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN -- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SELF EMPLOYMENT INCOME WAS NOT COUNTED TOWARDS -- DO. PAGE THREE SHOWS HOW THE STATE CREDIT WAS EXPANDED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OF SITES THAT. FREQUENT. ON THEM WHEN THEY CREATED IT DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE. YES ISN'T. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN A LITTLE LESS THAN UNDER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FILERS TOOK THE CREDIT. IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AT THE STATE LEVEL. THANK YOU OKAY. SO PAGE THREE SHOWS THE STATE CREDIT WAS EXPANDED IN EIGHTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE STATE RAISE THE INCOME LIMITS CONSIDERABLY. AND ALSO THE THEY DECIDED TO ALLOW SELF EMPLOYMENT INCOME TO COUNT WHICH YOU KNOW BRINGS THE STATE CREDIT IN MORE IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL CREDIT ON THAT -- IN THAT WAY. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE INCOME LIMITS WERE RAISED AGAIN. BOB AND SO NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW THE INCOME LIMIT IS ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A LITTLE LESS AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FOR FILERS WITH NO DEPENDENTS. IN JUST UNDER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER FILERS WHO HAVE DEPENDENTS. THE OTHER CHANGE WAS MADE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS IT. FILERS WHO HAVE NO DEPENDENTS AND ARE EITHER YOUNGER THAN AGE TWENTY FIVE OR OLDER THAN AGE SIXTY FIVE WERE MADE ELIGIBLE FOR THE A.. OF THESE FILERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL EITC SO THAT'S SORT OF THE ONE OF ONE RESPECT IN WHICH THE STATE EITC IS MORE GENEROUS THAN THE FEDERAL EITC IT COVERS SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL CREDIT. NOW THE CHART SHOWS HOW. THE I. E. A. T. STRUCTURE LOOKS NOW. IN AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A YOU KNOW PRETTY STEEP ASCENT TO THE PEAK IN THAT IS STEEP BUT DESCENT ONCE YOU GET ONCE YOU HIT THE PEAK. NOW YOU CAN SEE THERE'S SORT OF A LONG TAIL AT THE END THAT -- WHEN THE INCOME LIMITS FOR EXTENDED THE AMOUNTS THAT WENT TO PEOPLE WHO MAY WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT BEFORE WORK KEPT FAIRLY LOW I MEAN THIS IS SORT OF BY DESIGN IS A? THERE IS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO EXPAND THE ATC. THE UP. THE LEGISLATURE MADE THE DECISION TO OFFERS NO CUT IN EXPANSION THAT WAS FAIRLY BROAD ALTHOUGH NOT ESPECIALLY GENEROUS FOR ANY OF THE NEW FILERS. SO. YEAH WELL MORE PEOPLE CAN CLAIM THE EITC THE FOR PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR THE ORIGINAL VERSION THE AMOUNTS THAT THEY GET ARE NOT ALL THAT HIGH IN. THE SORT THE TAIL EXHORTED EVEN MORE EXAGGERATED FOR FILERS WITH NO DEPENDENTS BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING FROM A LIMIT OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO LIMIT -- TO SEVEN IN THEIR THE RECEIVE FAIRLY MODEST AMOUNTS. PAGE FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. YEAH. AROUND THAT. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE AMOUNTS CLAIMING IT HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME. IN FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN UNDER THE ORIGINAL VERSION. ABOUT A LITTLE LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR FILERS TOOK THE CREDIT EVERY YEAR IN THE AMOUNT WAS AROUND TWO HUNDRED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR WAS AROUND TWO HUNDRED MILLION. NOW IN SEVENTEEN AFTER THE EXPANSION. THE NUMBER OF FILERS WHO TOOK IT NO ROSE BY NEARLY IN NEARLY QUADRUPLED SO IN NEARLY A MILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE. OR NOT PEOPLE NEARLY MIL MILLION AND A HALF RETURNS HAD THE ATC ON IT ACTUALLY IT REPRESENTS A LOT MORE THAN A MILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE BECAUSE MOST RETURNS ESPECIALLY FOR THE IDC. ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME DEPENDENCE ON THEM -- THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE A. T. C. WENT UP TO THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION SO THE AVERAGE CREDIT AMOUNT AS YOU CAN SEE GOT A LOT LOWER. AND THIS IS MOSTLY BECAUSE THE MOST OF THE NEW FILERS RING THAT LONG TAIL AND WERE ELIGIBLE FOR RELATIVELY SMALL E. I. T. C. AMOUNTS. SO WITH IT REALLY GROW THE NUMBER OF THOSE ON THE LOWER INCOME. SIGN NO WITH THE EXPANSIONS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE AFFECT ON PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST END OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION AND LESLIE AT SELF EMPLOYMENT INCOME. OR IN LESS THE WERE -- SINGLE FILERS WHO WERE UNDER TWENTY FIVE ARE OVER. SIXTY FIVE DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE REALLY REACHING IN TERMS OF THE ELIGIBLE -- TAXPAYERS IT'S HARD TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT BUT IT 40% OR TWENTY YEAR PROBABLY CLOSE PROBABLY CLICK MORE LIKE SEVENTY BUT IT'S HARD TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT BECAUSE TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO USE THE DATA FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU. AND THE INCOME DEFINITIONS -- FOR FOR TAX PURPOSES DON'T REALLY MATCH UP ALL THAT WELL THE INCOME DEFINITIONS IT THE CENSUS USES SO IT'S IT'S KIND IT'S KIND OF UNCLEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE. ILL WITH THE POPULATION IS THAT YOU KNOW IS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS BUT ISN'T TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT. OKAY AND WE DO HAVE SO AT THIS POINT SOME PRELIMINARY DATA FOR A TAX YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOR WHICH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FILING THEIR RETURNS YOU KNOW. SINCE JANUARY. SO FAR OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION FILE FILERS HAVE ALREADY CLAIMED THE E. A. T. C.. FOR THIS YEAR WHICH IS I BELIEVE -- AHEAD OF THE SCHEDULE FROM LAST YEAR DO YOU. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH. OKAY WE'LL GET YOU -- WE CAN GET THAT FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE -- WOULD JUST KEEP GOING WITH THIS FOR NOW. WE HAVE YET [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] PLEASE. ACTUALLY THIS IS ABOUT ON PACE WITH. LAST YEAR FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OF FILERS AND THIS TIME OKAY -- NO WE'RE LOOKING THE WRONG THINGS. A MISTAKE YES IT'S ABOUT A MILLION AND US ONE POINT. THREE OKAY SO IT'S THAT'S SO FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE FILERS THE LAST YEAR SO [inaudible] OKAY. PAGE FIVE SHOWS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED THE ATC EXPANSION SO. ON THIS GRAPH. THE SOLID LINES SHOW THE CURRENT EA T. C.. AND THE DOTTED LINES SHOW THE PROPOSED -- EXPANDED THE ATC. AND SO IT IS YOU CAN SEE THE THE PROPOSED EXPANSION DOES NOT ALTER THE BENEFITS THAT FILE IS WOULD GET UP YOU KNOW WHO WERE. BASICALLY UP TO THE CURRENT KING POINT WHERE THE AMOUNT. OF THE A. T. C. STARS DECLINE MORE SLOWLY. HE USES THE TERMINOLOGY I WAS USING EARLIER THE TALE OF THE ATC IS NOW GETTING HIGHER AND LONGER. FOR FILE IS WITH WITH TWO DEPENDENTS. AND SHOWN HERE. IF YOUR INCOME IS ABOUT YOU SAY THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE YOU GET A YOU START TO GET A OF IN THE INCREASE THE ATC AMOUNT. AND AROUND THE CURRENT KING POINT IS ACTUALLY WHERE THE THE BIGGEST INCREASE COMES WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT BELOW [inaudible] FIFTEEN THOUSAND NO. THE INCOME LIMITSFOR ALL FILERS ARE BEING EXTENDED TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHETHER YOU HAVE KIDS OR NOT SO THAT'S IT. THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS A BIGGER INCREASE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE KIDS DEPENDENCE. BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE AMOUNTS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE DEPENDENTS ARE NOT ESPECIALLY LARGE COMPARED TO THE AMOUNTS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEPENDENTS. SO THE PEOPLE IN THE THE FILE IS NEW CLOSER TO THE UPPER END OF THE CURRENT INCOME DISTRIBUTION WILL GET A BIT MORE OF AN INCREASE. THEN THE THE FILERS WHO WERE AT THE LOWER END WHO WON'T SEE AN INCREASE. FROM THIS PARTICULAR FROM THIS A COMPONENT OF IT. FOR FILERS WHO ARE WHO DO NOT HAVE ANY DEPENDENCE THE KING DISAPPEARS AND SO YOU INSTEAD YOU JUST GET A GRADUAL DECLINE. ONCE YOU HIT THE OF ONCE YOUR INCOME PASSES THE THE AMOUNT FOR WHICH YOU GET THE P. D. A. T. C. YOU GET A GRADUAL DECLINE ALL THE WAY TO THE NEW INCOME LIMIT OF THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THE OTHER THING THAT THE A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES THAT IS NOT SHOWN. IS IT FILERS WHO HAVE SILLY SOME INCOME SOME ELIGIBLE INCOME. AND AT LEAST ONE DEPENDENT UNDER THE AGE OF SIX WILL GET FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NOW WILL BE THE SAME AS IF THAT BE THE SAME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IF YOU HAVE ONE KID UNDER THE AGE OF SIX IS IF YOU HAVE. SIX IT'S JUST IS IF YOU HAVE ANY ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTY GET A FLAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THAT IS IF YOUR INCOME. IS ABOVE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS THE AMOUNT PHASES OUT PROPORTIONATELY AS YOU GET TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO YOU COULDN'T GET THAT IF YOU'RE A 300-003-0000 DOLLARS IT WOULD BE ZERO OR NOT YEAH. THIRTY THOUSAND IS THE MAX INCOME. YES FOR ANY OF THIS YES OKAY. PAGE SIX SOME. SHOWS THE LA OWES ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REACH A LOT OF PEOPLE WE ESTIMATE THAT IT WOULD NO MORE THAN TWO MILLION CALIFORNIA FILERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS. SPENT IN MOST OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE OR NOT TOO FAR ABOVE IT. NOW THAT SAID BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THIS PROPOSAL REALLY KIND OF GOES BROAD INSTEAD A DEEP IT PROVIDES A MODEST BENEFIT TO A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE -- THEY WOULDN'T MOVE ALL THAT MANY PEOPLE ABOVE THE POVERTY LINE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY BELOW WHAT WE ESTIMATE THAT IT WOULD MOVE ROUGHLY. FIFTY THOUSAND FILERS FROM BELOW THE POVERTY LINE TO ABOVE IT IN MAYBE TWELVE THOUSAND FILERS OUT OF DEEP POVERTY WHICH IS DEFINED AS HALF THE POVERTY LEVEL. SO IT'S IT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO THE THE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN EXPANSIONS AND IN IN THAT IT'S SOME. IT GIVES A MODEST BENEFIT TO A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AS OPPOSED TO A MORE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO A SMALLER NUMBER OKAY -- WE DON'T EXPECT IT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT PEOPLE WORK. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT. THE MAIN EFFECTIVE THE EITC ON LABOR MARKETS IS. TO IN ARMED PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE YOU KNOW NOT HAVE WORKED IN THE FORMAL LABOR MARKET AT ALL. SO WITH. ON THE OTHER HAND IT -- TENDS NOT TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY WORKING IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T MUCH AFFECT THE NUMBER OF HOURS THEY WORK YOU KNOW CONDITIONAL ON ALREADY ON ON THEM ALREADY BEING IN THE FORMAL WORKFORCE. AND SO AS A IN VIEW IS THIS WE DON'T EXPECT A HUGE IMPACT FROM -- THIS PROPOSAL ON LABOR HOURS BECAUSE THE THE MAIN INCREASE IN BENEFIT GOES TO PEOPLE WHO WERE. YOU KNOW. AT THE MAIL TOWARD THE UPPER END OF THE EITC ELIGIBLE DISTRIBUTION WHICH IS -- WHICH IS IT WE EXPECT THIS TO MOSTLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE WORK FORCE I MEAN THE PRICE WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOME IMPACT IN TERMS OF DRAWING NEW PEOPLE IN THAT BECAUSE THE BENEFITS ARE. SORT OF TILTED TOWARD THE UPPER END OF THIS -- THIS ELIGIBLE RANGE WE THINK IT WOULD BE -- PROBABLY SMALLER THAN IF THE BENEFITS WERE TILTED MORE FOR THE LOWER AND OKAY -- THE LAST THING WE WOULD ADD IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE COULD -- TRY -- TO GIVE WORKING PARENTS IN INCOME BOOST ONE OTHER THING WE WOULD. WHAT SUGGEST AS A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE FOR ADDITION TO WITH THIS IS A? THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE -- TO TAKE THE CURRENT CHILDCARE CREDIT THAT'S ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW. THE AND MAKE IT REFUNDABLE AGAIN AND SO. WE THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE. IT CAN BE MADE REFUNDABLE AGAIN AS IT WAS BEFORE TWO THOUSAND TEN AND POSSIBLY EXPANDED EVEN. FOR COST OF YOU KNOW AROUND A HUNDRED MILLION OR SO. ANNUALLY. NOW WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS WOULD IT. POSE A LIKE THAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE IN A SOMEWHAT. WOULD HELP A SOMEWHAT HIGHER INCOME POPULATION IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD BECAUSE KERR. MAKING THE CHILD CARE CREDIT REFUNDABLE WOULD PROBABLY HELP PEOPLE UP TO AN INCOME OF ROUGHLY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS COMPARED TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THIS CREDIT. ON THE OTHER HAND THE THE CHILD CARE CREDIT THAT'S ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW. SEEMS A LITTLE BIT -- INCONGRUOUS IS THE IS A SORT OF ANTI POVERTY POLICY BECAUSE IT'S NOT REFUNDABLE IN THERE FOR IT. PROVIDES NO BENEFIT TO THE LOWEST INCOME FILERS WHO DON'T HAVE ANY -- THAT LIABILITY AFTER A THEIR CREDITS ARE CALCULATED. AND SO WOULD. TAKE QUESTIONS NOW YEAH. ALL OF THESE [inaudible] SOLD. IF. YOU KNOW. WHICH ALREADY HAS WHAT. DO WITH THE OTHER. SO HERE'S THE YOU CAN DO THAT EASIER THAN I CAN THERE'S THOSE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. RIGHT THE EITC AND THEN YOU HAVE SEVERAL PROPOSALS. WELL WE HAVE THE GOVERNOR. IS THAT THE ONLY WOMEN'S CONSIDERED. A REAL. SO THERE'S THE THERE IS. A LINK TO EXISTING CREDITS ARE THOSE ARE THE STATE EITC AS IT'S CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED. ALL VOLCANO PLUS A LITTLE TALE -- AND THEN THERE IS THE CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT WHICH THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS ON THE BOOKS BUT IT IS NON REFUNDABLE SO IF YOU. DON'T HAVE ANY TAX LIABILITY YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING BACK I IN THE PAST THAT WAS A REFUNDABLE CREDIT. AND THEN THERE IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND -- THE EITC CREATE MAKE THE TALE MUCH LONGER ON IN ADDITION TO THE CHILD CREDIT. ON AND THEN THERE WAS THE PROPOSAL YOU I HEARD THIS MORNING FROM THE SENATOR. AS WELL WHICH IS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL AND THAT'S THE DEEPER THAT'S REALLY TARGETED. AT THE AYE DEEPER PROPERTY CORRECT YES. NOT. EXTENDING OR INCREASE IN THE THE EXISTING CREDITS IT WOULD BE A NEW AND DIFFERENT CRIED A SALARY THAT'S CORRECT YEAH IN. A MONTH RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT OKAY -- YES YOU [inaudible] YES SIR. GOOD MORNING -- THANK YOU FOR A MONEY WAS TEACHING WITH A REFINED THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY PERCENT. OF THE GOVERNOR'S ATTACKS PROPOSAL I'M IN A MINUTE I'LL BE GOING. ON OVER THE THE EIGHTY PROPOSED BY FIRST ONE START OFF BY TALKING ABOUT THE THE COMBINED EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND CONFORMITY. OF PACKAGE -- THE VERY HIGH LEVEL THIS INCLUDES AN EXPANSION OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT -- WHICH WE'RE CALLING ON THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT A COST OF LIVING REFUND. AND CONFORMITY PACKAGE WILL RAISE ENOUGH REVENUE BILLION DOLLARS. TO PAY FOR THE CURRENT EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EXPANSION. WE'RE COMBINING THESE TWO PROVISIONS BECAUSE WITHOUT THE CONFORMITY PACKAGE THERE'S NO WAY TO PAY FOR THE EXPANSION. OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THE AND THE EXISTING ERNESTINE TAX CREDIT. THIS COMBINED PACKAGE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE BALLOTS AND RESILIENT BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. IN JANUARY. SO -- WITHOUT GOING TO TOO MUCH DETAIL BECAUSE OF MR CHRISTIE FROM THE LA -- DID OF TO FIND. DESCRIBING IT WE SENT YOU HAVE WE HAVE THREE COMPANIES TO OR ARE EXPANSION PROPOSAL -- THE FIRST ONE IS HE SAID WOULD MOVE. THE CALL FINE INCOME UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ALL TAXPAYERS WITH THE INDEPENDENT OR NOT -- AND THAT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IS PAID AT FULL TIME. FOR THE S. PERSON EARNING FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR. FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR WILL BE THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. DALY CITY WITH SCHEDULED RIGHT NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO WE'VE PAID AT THE THEN -- MINIMUM WAGE. AND OUR FORCES TO KEEP IT AT THAT THIRTY THOUSAND UNTIL. THE FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE KICK SAND AND THEN FROM THERE ON INCREASE WITH CONFLICT -- SO THE SECOND PART IS -- THE SECOND PART IS TO THAT A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CREDIT PER FAMILY WITH WITH A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF SIX AND AS MR CHRISTIE POINTED OUT IT WOULD BE PHASED OUT. OF BETWEEN -- INCOMES AND FINALLY -- WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS OF THE THE STRUCTURE IS BEING CHANGED TO THE TAXPAYERS [inaudible] EARNING -- WELL LET ME JUST GO BACK. THE THE WE'VE READ IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THE BUDGET IS EXPANDED THE EARNED TOUCH WITH THE OLD ABILITY. TO THAT -- SIGNIFICANT MORE AMOUNT OF OF PEOPLE WILL QUALIFY FOR BUT THE NON CREDIT SEE GOT WERE VERY LIMITED AVERAGING BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER PERSON. FOR THOSE THOSE TAXPAYERS -- SO WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO GIVE A THOSE TAXPAYERS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE. TO OUR FOCUS HERE HAS BEEN -- THIS ORDER THE ORIGINAL FOCUS OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WAS REALLY FOCUS ON PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST IN. THE WAY WE STRUCTURE IT WAS REALLY JUST ON THE ON THE VERY. EARLY PART OF THE FEDERAL. EARNED INCOME TAX ON THOSE TAXPAYERS SO WHAT ARE WELL HERE IS TO TRY TO BEEF UP THE CREDIT THAT WE'RE GIVING. TO PEOPLE AT THE AT THE UPPER END IS IT REALLY. IF IF RESOURCES WERE NOT A CONSTRAINT WE'VE BUILT WE WOULD LIKE FEEL THE MAT AND ROLLS -- TEXT TO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TRYING -- TO SINCE WE DO HAVE SOME RESOURCES OR WE WILL GET THOSE RESOURCES WITH THE CONFORMITY PACKAGE -- TO EXPAND IT SO THAT WE'RE WE'RE PROVIDING A MORE MEANINGFUL CREDIT -- TO TO THOSE TAXPAYERS ON THE UPPER END. OF THE OF STILL BLOW POVERTY BUT ABOUT THE UPPER END OF THE ON THE UPPER END. OF THE END OF POVERTY YEAH RIGHT. THE SO ARE IN TOTAL ARE PACKED -- PACKAGES IS EXPECTED TO COST ANOTHER THE CURRENT -- INCOME TAX RETURN [inaudible] DOLLARS. HOW ARE PROPOSAL SHOULD COST ABOUT ANOTHER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- AND WE EXPECT THAT HE WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS BENEFITING. FROM THEIR INCOME TAX RATE FROM ABOUT -- TWO MILLION TAXPAYERS TO THREE MILLION. HOME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. QUESTION YOU JUST SAID IT WOULD EXPAND THE NUMBER ELIGIBLE NUMBER ELIGIBLE. TWO MILLION THREE MILLION. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE YEAH I THINK WHAT MISTER GROSS SAID WAS IT TWO MILLION TAXPAYERS WOULD BENEFIT. SO INCLUDING THE MILLION WHO ARE NEWLY GETTING ANY IDC AND THEN MIL AND ANOTHER MILLION WHO WOULD BE GETTING A SOMEWHAT HIGHER. BEFORE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S IT'S TO TO MILL TWO HUNDRED MILLION. THESE TO ME TWO MILLION IT'S GOOD WE'RE GOING FROM TWO MILLION TO THREE MILLION. SO SO THEY'LL BE THREE MILLION WIN THIS. IF THIS IS ADOPTED WE WOULD WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS BENEFIT. FROM THE DISTRICT. CAN I ASK YOU WHAT WHAT. WHAT WAS THE THINKING BEHIND? NOT GIVING. MORE TO YOU WERE THAT WERE IN. YEAH AND YOU CAN POVERTY RIGHT THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S. COACH SO TO GO BACK TO WIN WIN THIS ORIGINALLY STARTED IT WAS REALLY FOCUS ON ON FOLKS IN IN THE DEEPEST POVERTY. AND SO WE ARE. WE ARE TRYING TO TRYING TO EXPAND THE ATC TO HELP. PEOPLE SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL CREDIT NOW WE'RE NOT WE DON'T. OUR INCOME GOOD JUST GO NEARLY SIZE A FEDERAL CREDIT GOES BUT WE WANT TO GIVE. PEOPLE EARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE. ADDITIONAL SO THAT ARE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IS A IS MORE -- HOLISTIC IS IS HELPING PEOPLE WERE STILL IN PRETTY DIRE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES -- BUT IT'S IT'S SPREADING THAT MONEY MORE EVENLY AGAIN IT'S IT'S A IT'S A QUESTION OF RESOURCES HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO PAY -- FOR GREATER EXPANSION IT'S NOT YOU DON'T SEE THAT IT WOULD LESSEN THE NUMBER OR IN -- DEEPER POVERTY IT WOULD LESSEN THE NUMBER NO NO NO ONE WOULD BE HURT BY THIS IS TOTALLY DISABILITY BENEFITS TO ANY TAXPAYER [inaudible] THE OKAY. OKAY NOW WE CAN GO TO YOU. WERE WITH THE BUDGET POLICY CENTER THAT'S RIGHT M. HAS TO GET RUNNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT MY NAME IS SARAH CAM RELIN AND I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST. WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTER. AM I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL AT THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE CALLIE ITC. TWO AT TWO TAX FILERS WHO USE AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER -- AND AS I WENT TO I WILL START TODAY BY DESCRIBING WHAT THAT PROPOSAL INCLUDES -- THEN I'LL HIGHLIGHT A FEW REASONS THAT THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT AND THEN I'LL FINISH BY DESCRIBING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUALS LIKELY BENEFIT FROM THE PROPOSAL. AND SO I WANT TO START BY JUST EMPHASIZING THAT THE CALLIE ITC IS A VITALLY IMPORTANT INVESTMENT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC SECURITY IN OUR STATE -- IT HELPS WORKING FAMILIES MAKE ENDS MEET -- IN OUR HIGH COST STATE AND THERE IS A WEALTH OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT EARNED INCOME TAX CREDITS AND POLICIES MY GENERALLY THE INCREASE THE INCOMES OF FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH ECONOMIC AND SECURITY. ARE LINKED TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES AND OF WRITER DO MEANS INCLUDING EDUCATION AND HEALTH EMPLOYMENT -- AND EVEN TO IMPROVE LONG TERM ADULT OUTCOMES FOR THE CHILDREN WHO ARE GROWING UP IN POVERTY. SO -- FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE EXTENDING THE CALLIE IDC IN ORDER TO REACH EVEN MORE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH LOW INCOMES IS A SMART SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM STATE INVESTMENT. AT THE PROPOSAL I'M SPEAKING ABOUT TODAY SPECIFICALLY WITH EXTEND ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT CALLIE ITC TO TAX FILERS WHO USE INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS ARE I TENS IS THAT CALLED. AND SO CURRENTLY. THE KELLY IDC PARALLELS THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE FEDERAL EITC AND REQUIRING THAT ALL FILERS INDEPENDENCE -- WHO ARE CLAIM FOR PURPOSES OF THE KELLY ATC MUST HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THAT IS VALID FOR WORK -- THIS EXCLUDES MANY IMMIGRANT -- FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LIVING IN OUR STATE -- AND FILING TAXES FROM BENEFITING FROM THE KELLY AT YOU SEE EVEN IF THEY ARE WORKING AND THEY HAVE VERY LOW INCOME SO THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT. SO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM BENEFITING RIGHT NOW INCLUDE IMMIGRANT WORKERS WHO DO NOT HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AS WELL AS THEIR CHILDREN WITH THE CHILDREN ARE U. S. BORN ARE DREAMERS -- AND ALSO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THAT IS VALID FOR WORK THROUGH FEDERAL POLICIES LIKE DHAKA OR TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS. BUT WHO SUBSEQUENTLY LOSE THEIR IMMIGRATION RELIEF DUE TO CHANGES IN FEDERAL POLICY. AND THEY WOULD THEN BECOME AN ELIGIBLE FOR THE KELLY ATC -- SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS TO APPLY FOR A FEDERALLY ISSUED I TEN IN ORDER TO FILE INCOME TAXES OR IDENTIFY CHILDREN AS DEPENDENTS ON TAX FORMS AND MANY. OF INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT -- AND SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW TAX FILERS TO USE THOSE FEDERALLY ISSUED I TENS OR ANY FEDERALLY ISSUED SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TO FILE FOR AND CLAIM THE KELLY IDC. PROVIDED THAT THE FILE THERE MADE ME IT'S ALL OTHER KELLY IDC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA -- I WANNA KNOW CALIFORNIA IS NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE SAME ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AS THE FEDERAL EITC. IN FACT -- AS AT THE LA -- NOTED PREVIOUSLY WE'VE ALREADY CHOSEN TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY BEYOND TO THE PILOTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL EIGHT THE ATC. IN EXTENDING THE CREDIT TO WORKING YOUNG ADULTS ANTI WORKING SENIORS ABOUT DEPENDENT CHILDREN -- AND ALSO THE FTP ALSO ALREADY ACCEPTS INCOME TAX PAYMENTS FROM FILERS WHO USE I TENS. UM AND ALL FILERS ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWED TO USE SELF EMPLOYMENT INCOME TO QUALIFY FOR THE KELLY SEE WHICH IS THE TYPE OF INCOME THAT WOULD I TEN FATHERS WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO REPORT. AND SO AT IMMIGRANTS OF FILING TAXES WITH HIGH TENS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ESSENTIALLY THE ONLY REMAINING MAJOR GROUP OF WORKING CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW INCOMES WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM ACCESSING THE BENEFITS OF THE KELLY I. T. C. NOW -- AND I WANTED TURN NEXT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THREE KEY POINTS -- FOR WHY INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE ALLEY TO SEE COULD BE WELL WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT. ANSWER TURNING TO THE TO THE HAND OUT -- THAT I PROVIDED -- SO AS SHOWN ON THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. ONE KEY CONSIDERATION IS THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE REALLY VITAL TO CALIFORNIA'S LABOR FORCE. SO -- WE ALL KNOW OUR STATE IS AN ECONOMIC POWER HOUSE WE HAVE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD ROUGHLY ONE SEVENTH OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. AS A STATE WE CAN TRAP YOU ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TIMES AS MUCH TO NATIONAL GDP AS ANY OTHER STATE -- AND WE COULD NOT BE THE ECONOMIC POWER HOUSE WITHOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS -- AS THIS -- CHART SHOWS IMMIGRANTS -- MAKE UP ONE AND THREE WORKERS IN THE STATE. AND ALSO I THINK THE FACT THAT NEARLY ONE IN FIVE WORKERS IN THE STATE ARE YOU ES BORN BUT GREW UP AS THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS. HOW IT'S THE FACT THAT INVESTING IN THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES -- IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC FUTURE AS WELL. TURNING TO THE NEXT SLIDE OVER THE NEXT -- CHARTS -- I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT IMMIGRANTS INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND SO ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM THE KELLY IDC. ALSO MAKE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO STATE AND LOCAL TAXES -- AS SHOWN IN THIS CHART -- WITH THE ESTIMATE IS THAT THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ARE MADE BY -- UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN CALIFORNIA -- I ALSO WANTED OF THAT. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ALSO MAKE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO FEDERAL TAXES AND RECENT TAX POLICY CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAVE REDUCED THE ELIGIBILITY OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES FOR FEDERAL TAX CREDITS. SO SPECIFICALLY THE TAX CUTS AND AT BACK AND JOBS ACT TO CHANGE THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE FEDERAL CHILD TAX CREDIT. TO REQUIRE THAT ALL CHILDREN CLAIM FOR THE CREDIT MUST HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER VALID FOR WORK -- SO ESSENTIALLY THIS TAKE AWAY ELIGIBILITY FOR THE FEDERAL CHILD TAX CREDIT FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE DREAMERS -- AND MADE THEIR FAMILIES ELIGIBLE INSTEAD FOR A MUCH SMALLER CREDIT THAT IS NOT REFUNDABLE SAID PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGES -- LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND THEIR CHILDREN -- SO THAT YOU COULD SAY THAT THE PROPOSAL TO ALLOW AYE TENDS TO BE USED. FOR THE CALIFORNIA -- CALLIE IDC -- COULD IS A IS AN APPROACH TO HELPING TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECTS OF THIS FEDERAL ACTION. I'M TURNING NEXT -- TO THE NEXT PAGE THE HAND OUT. THE FINAL PLAN I WANNA MAKE IN TERMS OF THE CONSIDERATIONS HERE AS THAT EXTENDING THE KILEY TO SEE TO MORE WORKING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ALSO MAKES SENSE BECAUSE CHILDREN. WHO GROW UP WITH AN IMMIGRANT PARENT I'M MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE GROWING UP IN POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA AS CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE AN IMMIGRANT PARENT -- AND WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN HAVE BETTER SHORT TERM OUTCOMES AND BETTER LONG TERM OUTCOMES IF THEY GROW UP WITH ECONOMIC SECURITY -- AND AGAIN THIS IS ALSO IMPORTANT -- FOR THE WELL BEING OF THOSE CHILDREN AND BECAUSE IMMIGRANTS ALSO ARE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S WORK FIRST THIS IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT. CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE WORK FORCE AS WELL. SO AND FINALLY I WANT TO TURN -- TO THE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO IT LIKELY BENEFIT FROM FROM THIS PROPOSAL. AND SO AT THE BUDGET CENTER HAS MODELED THIS PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE KELLY IDC TIGHTEN USERS USING -- CENSUS DATA IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SOME ESTIMATES THAT SHOW THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD LIKELY BENEFIT. I'M SO THESE ESTIMATES SHOW -- THAT EXTENDING THE CURRENT KILEY IDC TIGHTEN USERS COULD BENEFIT YOU KNOW AS MANY AS HALF A MILLION OR MORE INDIVIDUALS. THE COUNTY FILED INDIVIDUALS AND BENEFITING TAX UNITS INCLUDING AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE MORE -- IT'S BASED ON A RELATIVELY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF TAKE UP AT I TEN USERS WERE ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EXPANSION. AND THAT EXPANSION WERE ADOPTED -- THAN THE NUMBER BENEFITING WOULD BE LARGER. I'M. AND I'M AN ESTIMATED 97% OF THE BENEFICIARIES WOULD BE PEOPLE OF COLOR. ON AN ESTIMATED 74% OF THE BENEFITING TAX FILERS WOULD BE LIVING IN HOUSEHOLDS THAT INCLUDE CHILDREN BUT THEY'RE NOT THAT THE CHILDREN WERE IN THE TAX FILERS -- TAX UNIT -- SO IT REALLY WOULD OVERWHELMINGLY BENEFITS HAVE FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. I'M IN SOME OF THE COMMON OCCUPATIONS AMONG THE BENEFITING WORKERS INCLUDE -- OCCUPATIONS LIKE FARMWORKERS HOUSEKEEPERS COOKS CONSTRUCTION LABORERS JANITORS AND GROUNDS MAINTENANCE WORKER SO PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING A LOT OF THE CRITICAL WORK THAT SUPPORTS SO MUCH OF THE TIME -- PERSONALIZE AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OF OUR STATE. I AM AND I WOULD ALSO ANOTHER THE THE BENEFITS TO PEOPLE OF COLOR INTO TEXT FILES WITH CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY INTENSIVE POVERTY BECAUSE ALREADY DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS CHILDREN OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA SO -- SO I JUST WANNA CONCLUDE -- BUT NOTING THAT ALL THESE POINTS TOGETHER SUGGEST THAT EXTENDING THE KELY IDC TYSON USERS COULD BE A STRATEGY TO STRENGTHEN. THE KELLY IDC ANTICS AND THE BENEFITS OF THE STATE INVESTMENT TO THE LAST REMAINING GROUP THAT HAS REMAINING MAJOR GROUP OF WORKING. FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED -- AND THEREBY INCREASING THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF THIS IMPORTANT GROUP OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SENATORS. QUESTION. NO COMMENTS -- PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. THESE. GOOD AFTERNOON OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION AROUND -- THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE NEARLY SOUND ABOUT WHAT THE UNITED WAYS -- OF CALIFORNIA WE FIGHT FOR THE HEALTH EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY OF EVERY PERSON AND EVERY [inaudible] OF NOT ONLY OF STRENGTHENING THE KELLY I TO SEE THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT -- I TEN FILERS ARE NOT EXCLUDED FROM THE KELLY I TO SEE -- I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT SPECIFICALLY THAT -- THIS EXCLUSIONS PARTICULARLY HOW HARMFUL FOR FAMILIES WERE EVEN IF THERE'S A US CITIZEN CHILDREN WITHIN THE FAMILY SIDE -- THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CREDIT -- WE ALSO WORK WITH -- BY THE SITES ARE FREE TAX PREPARATION SITES AND WE SEE FIRSTHAND WHAT THIS EXCLUSION DOES I WANTED TO JUST. SHARE REALLY QUICKLY A STORY FROM A MOM OF THREE I REMAINED A WHO WORKS HAVE HARVESTING GRAPES THAN A BILLIARD SHE WENT TO A FREE TAX BY THE SITE SHE'S THE DOCTOR RECIPIENT. AND SHE GOT ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS ON HER FEDERAL NY I TO SEE RETURN -- IF SHE WERE TO LOSE HER DOC I STATUS SHE WOULD ESSENTIALLY LOSE HER. KELLY I TO SEE ON HER FEDERAL EITC -- THIS CONSTITUTED ABOUT A ONLY MADE ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS -- A YEAR SO -- YOU DON'T THIS INCLUSION OF ITEM PILAR'S IS DEFINITE DEFINITE LEE ESSENTIAL -- I ALSO WANTED TO SPEAK -- TO THE INVESTMENT AROUND FREE TAX BUT BUT NOT REACH A NOTE -- THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE AND INCREASE THE THE BEST A MULTI YEAR FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. TO REACH THE FAMILIES WHO NEED THOSE CREDIT THE MOST -- SOIL IN ST WE STRONGLY URGE -- TO TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL THAT REMOVES THE EXCLUSION OF I TEN FILERS AND ALSO -- TO HAVE CONTINUED AN INCREASE FUNDING -- FOR WILL TELL YOUR FREE TAX PREP AND OUT REACH AS WELL THANK YOU.

WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION HAPPENED HERE TODAY ON THE CAL YET TO SEE AN SPECIFICALLY ON I TEN FILERS I MEAN WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU EIGHTY C. HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER PROGRAM TO LIVE FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. OUR RESEARCH AND EVALUATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE AGENCY PROMOTES EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY. I IMPROVES CHILD AND MATERNAL HEALTH. I IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN ONE THIRD TO THE STATE'S GDP AS WAS MENTIONED AND ARE VITAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. THEY MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AS WAS MENTIONED CONTRIBUTE OVER THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR MANY YEARS. I AND YET THOUSANDS A WORKING IMMIGRANT HOUSEHOLDS WITH THE RANGE OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IS. ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM ACCESSING THAT CAL YET YOU SEE BECAUSE OF THEIR I TEND TO USE TO FILE OTHER TAXES THIS EXCLUSION ALSO HARMS THOSE WHO HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. BUT LOSE OUR DOC OUR TPS IMMIGRATION RELIEF WHICH WE THINK IS ALSO CRITICAL. THE EXCLUSION NEGATIVELY IMPACTS TO ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE AS MANY IMMIGRANTS LIVING MAKE STATUS HOUSEHOLDS WITH U. S. CITIZEN CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE COUNTY ATC. BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS IMMIGRATION STATUS AND WE THINK THE INCLUDING I TEN FATHERS AND CAL UTC MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE IS BASED ON SOUND RESEARCH -- THAT SUPPORTS ITS EFFICACY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WOULD ENSURE THAT OUR STATE'S INVESTMENTS IN FIGHTING POVERTY -- IN FIGHTING POVERTY WORK TO FIGHT POVERTY FOR EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN THANK YOU SO MUCH. HI THANK YOU SO MUCH MY NAME IS THE BRAINY HAMMOND WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSET BUILDING COALITION COM MUCH LIKE WITH THE PREVIOUS PEOPLE HAVE SAID WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EXPANDING CAL CAL YET THE ITC.

AS SOON AS I WAS RELEASED FROM WORK I ATTENDED CLASSES AT A CONTINUATION SCHOOL TO LEARN ENGLISH. NOW I WORK ABOUT THIRTEEN HOURS A DAY RUNNING MY OWN DOLLAR STORE IN MY COMMUNITY. I WOULD INVEST IN THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE THAT WOULD PROVIDE MY FAMILY MORE LONG TERM INCOME. THE LITTLE I MAKE IS PAYING BILLS FOR MY HOME AND AT THE END THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT EXPANSION WOULD ASSIST ME IN PAYING THOSE BILLS AS WELL AS SAVING FOR THE REST OF THE BENEFIT OF MY FAMILY.

HI THERE TERRY ONLY WITH ECONOMIC SECURITY PROJECT ACTION WE ALSO ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE PROPOSAL HER TODAY TO INCLUDE I TENS IN THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM. I'D ALSO LIKE TO CALL ATTENTION TO TO YOU OTHER THINGS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INITIALLY CALLED -- FOR EXPANDING OR CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF THE IDC SO THAT PAYMENTS COULD BE -- DISPERSED ON A MONTHLY OR PERIODIC BASIS AND WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR STAFF AND OTHERS ON THAT TO MAKE THAT A REALITY WE THINK TAT WOULD DO GO A LONG WAY TO ADDRESSING INCOME VOLATILITY THAT A LOT OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS. WE KNOW THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE POPULATION THIS COUNTRY CAN'T WHETHER AN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE THE PAYMENTS -- MORE REGULARLY. PART OF THEIR INCOME ON A REGULAR BASIS WOULD -- WOULD REALLY HELP ADDRESS THAT OF THAT PROBLEM I KNOW IT COULD BE COMPLICATED BUT I THINK THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE COULD -- THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN ESPECIALLY. SINCE THERE IS -- I THINK THE REAL HOPE TO EXPAND THE THE THE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING GOING FORWARD SO THAT -- YOU BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING MORE REAL AND ON A MONTHLY BASIS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT. I'M AND FINALLY I ALSO REALLY WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE GOVERNOR'S -- CHILD YOUNG CHILD BOOST I THINK THAT IT GOES A LONG WAY TO RECOGNIZING THAT THE IMPORTANT WORK AT THAT HOUSEHOLDS DO TO CARE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN EVEN DOWN.

OUR REPORTED HAVING A MEMBER OF THEM DIDN'T HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SO WE THINK THAT. ARE WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXPANSION OF EITC AND AS WELL AS EXPANDING IT TIGHTEN FILE AS WE THINK THAT WOULD REALLY HELPTHE THE FOLKS THAT WE SERVE AND WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT WE SERVE REPORT THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR FOOD COMES FROM OUR SERVICES A MORE REALLY MEANT TO BE A A SUPPLEMENT -- AND SO HELPING LIFT FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY ILL MEAN THAT THEY'LL BE REQUIRED TO RELY LAST HEAVILY ON OUR SERVICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JACK ALONG WITH GRACE AND SUFFERING CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN I JUST WANNA LINE MY COMMENTS WITH NAY LA SOUND OF ALL WITH THE ON THAT YEAH I TO THE COALITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOSH RIGHT AGAIN WITH CALLS IT OPPORTUNITY WE RUN CAL YET YOU SEE FOR ME ONE OF THE OUT REACH PROGRAMS AROUND THIS -- AROUND THE IDC IS REALLY FUN TO HEAR THE HISTORY OF HOW THIS PROGRAM HAS EXPANDED SO DRASTICALLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND SO WE'RE SO EXCITED. TO SUPPORTTHE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND IT AND REACH MORE FAMILIES -- WANTED TO SHARE ONE QUICK STORY FROM A WOMAN WHO WE WORK WITH NAY MARLENE HOFFMAN WHO WORKS AT THE EAST MIND COMMUNITY CENTER IN EAST LOS ANGELES. WHO TALKED TO US AND TOLD US ABOUT WHAT THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PROPOSED INCREASE -- FOR HAVING CHILDREN WOULD MEAN TO HER AND SHE PAUSED AND SAID. IT WOULD MEAN THAT MY CHILDREN WOULD HAVE SHOES THAT WOULD FIT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MEANS IS ABOUT COVERING BASIC NEEDS FOR WORKING FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORTER THAT WERE AWESOME STRONG SUPPORT OF INCREASING THIS TO INCLUDE I TEN WORKERS AND THEN LASTLY JUST WANT TO PUT A FINE POINT. ON THE OUT REACH PORTION OF THIS BECAUSE AS WITH MANY OF US KNOW WHO WHO ARE WORKING IN THIS DAY TO DAY. MANY OF THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO REACH ARE ACTUALLY NOT REQUIRED TO FILE TAXES. AND SO IN ORDER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY CLAIM THIS CREDIT IN ORDER FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO BE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ACTUALLY NEED TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MONEY IS AVAILABLE WHICH IS WHY THE AVERAGE AN EDUCATION COMPONENT SO IMPORTANT. AND THIS BODY HAS INVESTED A SIGNIFICANTLY AND AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT REACH AS POSSIBLE AND THAT IS WHY THIS YEAR WERE ACTUALLY NEARLY 40%. AHEAD OF WHAT WE WERE IN PAST YEARS -- IS ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE WE ARE INCREASING AND YOU GUYS HAVE INVESTED INCREASING OUTREACH EFFORTS. SO WE WOULD ACTUALLY ASK THAT THE THAT THE SENATE. CONSIDER INCREASING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PUT IN TO JUST BACK TO THE BASIC LEVEL WHAT YOU INVESTED LAST YEAR BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY WORKING WE'RE SEEING IT WORK AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES. HAVE THIS BENEFIT THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOES THE BIRTH OF AND WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE'VE ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT THESE WORKERS SHOULD BE INCLUDED AND RATHER THAN. AT CALLING FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE I. T. C. WE WOULD LIKE TO END THE EXCLUSION. OF WORKING PEOPLE FROM THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD I GET THE SAME TAX CREDIT OTHER WORKING PEOPLE GET THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] ANYMORE. COMMENT WELL I REALLY APPRECIATE DONE -- WHAT EVERYBODY HAS RAISED TODAY AND IN RESPONSE TO THE? GOVERNOR'S UP -- CERTAINLY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME THAT WE ARE. ONE WITH THE I. -- TEN THE FACT THAT -- THEY'RE WORKING POPULATION AND THEY'RE PAYING TAXES. AND THEY DON'T. THEY CAN'T -- THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE. OF FOR THE EIGHTY SI JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. SO -- I APPRECIATE THE THE COMMENTS -- IN SUPPORT OF EXTENDING ELIGIBILITY -- TO THOSE WITH AYE TEN I THINK IT'S PART OF THE COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITY THAT LIVES IN POVERTY. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR POLICIES ARE STATE POLICIES ARE CONSISTENT. IN THERE'S A BIG MIX OF OF BOMB. ON THE BIG MIX MESSAGE OUT THERE TO OUR COMMUNITIES THAT SUMMER ELIGIBLE FOR SOME SOMETIMES HERE SOMETIMES THERE -- AND IT REALLY DOESN'T SEND THE RIGHT MESSAGE AS FAR AS OUR GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED AND THE TRUST OF OUR GOVERNMENT. THAT THERE ARE THESE MIXED MESSAGES AS TO WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR WHAT SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS AS WELL IS TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. NOT ONLY THE FINANCIAL -- AND HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP FAMILIES IT JUST OVERALL WHAT ARE WE SAYING TO OUR COMMUNITIES WE SHOULD BE SAYING THAT YOU'RE ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE'RE GONNA TREAT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IN THE SAME WAY I THINK THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE CONSIDERATION [inaudible] NUMBER ANYMORE [inaudible] NO. PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON A WE HAD -- OKAY THIS IS THE QUINLAN. OKAY ON TAX CONFORMITY. YES -- RIGHT THANK YOU SO ARE TO PAY FOR THE ENTIRE. EARNED INCOME TAX FOR THE BOTH THE FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO THE CURRENT LAW AND FOR THE THE EXPANSION. ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A TAX CONFORMITY PACKAGE. THE LAW UP SEVERAL CHANGES THAT WILL MAKE TAX COMPLIANCE ADMINISTRATION EASIER FOR TAXPAYERS TAX REPAIRS AND FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. HAS WELLS ADOPT OTHER. FEDERAL TAX LAW CHANGES THAT MAKE GOOD POLICY SINCE. TWO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE TAX CODE. KNOWN AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT. THAT CHANGE THE WAY INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS CALCULATOR TAX LIABILITY. OUR PROPOSAL IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE CALIFORNIA PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND CORPORATE TAX SYSTEMS. ARE INEVITABLY INEVITABLY LINKED TO THE FEDERAL TAX SYSTEMS. AND IN SOME CASES CONFORMITY TO CERTAIN FEDERAL TAX PROVISIONS IS NECESSARY FOR THE EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OF OUR OWN TEXAS. IN ADDITION THERE ARE SEVERAL CHANGES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT MAKE GOOD POLICY CENTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I WANT TO GO THROUGH DESCRIBED WE'VE GOT -- TWELVE OR THIRTEEN THIRTEEN A DIFFERENT ITEMS I'M GONNA GO THROUGH FAIRLY QUICKLY SO I I WANT TO KEEP YOUR TO ALL BUT I'VE. TOGGLE FROM FAIRLY QUICKLY AND THEN -- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MORE DETAILS. OKAY YOU MAKE A DISTINCTION AS TO THOSE THAT HAVE LIKE THE MOST IMPACT. ARE YOU GONNA SURE I I MAY I HAVE THAT RIGHT AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PROBABLY THOSE THAT HAVE. YEAH I LIVE NEXT TO HIM ON ON PAGE THIRTY TWO I BELIEVE OF THE OF THE AGENDA -- THERE IS A TABLE. OF THAT IT SHOWS. THE SHOWS THE REVENUE -- BUT IN FACT I CAN. I WILL AFFECTED AS I GO THROUGH MY WILL I WILL TELL YOU WHICH HOW MUCH REVENUE. AND JIM I THINK WHAT I WILL DO IS TALK ABOUT THE THE SECOND YEAR REVENUE AND THE REASON BEING THAT FOR SURE REVENUE THIS IS SOMEWHAT INFLATED. BECAUSE YOU THE WAY THE WAY IT WORKS YOU END UP GETTING TWO YEARS COMBINED INTO ONE OF THE FIRST YEAR BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE ENACTED. AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR AND SO SOME TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IMPACT WILL. MOVE SHOP LATER IN THE YEAR IN THE END THAT TWENTY TWENTY SO -- SO WITH WITHOUT OF WHEN WE STARTED -- I DO WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT THE THE NUMBERS ARE ARE LISTED. I GET THE WRONG TABLE PAGE -- THIRTY TWO BUT OUR CONFORMITY PACKAGE HAS CHANGED SINCE BEEN KIND OF SMALL. SMALL WAY SENSE THIS TABLE WAS PUBLISHED AND SO THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO LINE UP PERFECTLY -- SO PLEASE GIVE A REAL GOOD BALLPARK OF OF WHAT WHAT THE REVENUE SHOULD BE. SO THE FIRST ITEM IS -- SMALL BUSINESS ACCOUNTING REFORM IN SIMPLE RULES. UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW WE ALLOW CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES MORE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY DO THEIR ACCOUNTING -- GENERALLY -- GENERALLY BUSINESSES HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF THEIR EXPENSES AND THE RECEIPTS IN A WAY THAT THAT. IS VERY PRECISE AND AND WANTED A WITH THAT WITH YOUR THAT IT. BELONGS IN WE GIVE MORE LEEWAY TO SMALL BUSINESSES TO TO NOT HAVE TO DO BE SO PRECISE IN THEIR OWNING A MAKES IT SIMPLER FOR THEM TO TO DO THAT -- AND AND SO -- PRIOR TO THE THE OF FEDERAL TAX LAW CHANGES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAVE THE SAME DEFINITIONS BUSINESS ESSENTIALLY IN THAT TAX SUCH CHANGE. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGED. WHAT IS MEANT BY A SMALL BUSINESS SO ESSENTIALLY IT IT MOVED -- THE DEFINITION SMALL BUSINESS. TO ANY ANY BUSINESS WITH GROSS RECEIPTS OF TWENTY% FIVE MILLION OUR LAPS -- AND SO DID AND TYPICALLY RIGHT NOW WITH OUR THRESHOLD IS AT ONE MILLION OR FIVE MILLION SO. IF WE DON'T CONFORM TO THIS REALLY A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES BUSINESSES HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MORE GENEROUS ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS FRIDAY BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OR DOING TWO SETS OF BOOKS ONE FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONE FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE CONFORMING WERE WERE PROPOSING WE CONFORM TO THOSE CHANGES. AND NOT NOT ACTUALLY THAT IS IS EXPECTED TO BE A REVENUE LOSS -- THAT IS I THINK THE FIFTH ITEM ON THE LIST -- TO TO IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO LOSS OF HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OKAY SO THE SECOND ITEM ON OUR LIST IS A REPEAL OF TECHNICAL TERMINATION OF PARTNERSHIPS. UNDER PRIOR FEDERAL LONG KERR A STATE LAW FOR PARTNERSHIP HAS A TRANSFER OF MORE THAN 50%. OF TOTAL INTEREST IN THE PARTNERSHIP -- WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD THE PARTNERSHIP IS CONSIDERED TO BE TECHNICALLY TERMINATED BY WHICH ONE IS THAT ON HERE. THIS CAN BE TOWARDS THE BOTTOM -- FOUR THREE ONE OKAY. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE OKAY SO -- SO WHAT THIS DOES IS -- IT IT CHANGES THE THE VALUATION OF ASSETS THE WAY THE SENSHI CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING FOR THAT -- FOR THAT FIRM SO AGAIN IF WE DON'T CONFORM -- WE WILL LEAVE A LOT F PARTNERSHIPS WITH HAVING TO DO TO SET TO BOOK ONE PER CALIFORNIA ONE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HI AND RALPH FOR BOTH THESE FIRST TWO WERE WERE PROPOSING NOXIOUS CONFORMITY -- IN STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUT WE ARE WHO WE ARE PROPOSING AND ELECTION. FOR THOSE TAXPAYERS WHO WANT TO TO CONFORM ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO THAT THE BOOKS ARE. CONSIST WITH FEDERAL FEDERAL LAW SINCE THE TAX OR CHANGE. THIS IS THE THIRD ITEM OF IS TO LIMIT LIKE CAN EXCHANGES. AND OF THAT WOULD BE THE THIRD ITEM ON THE LIST RACES TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND UNDER FOR PRIOR FEDERAL IN CURRENT STATE LAW. IF CERTAIN TYPES OF REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY OR DISPOSED OF THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF THAT ASSET. IS TO IS DEFERRED FOR TAX PURPOSES. IF THE IF IT IS EXCHANGE FOR LIKE KIND HOUSES. SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- WHAT THEY DID IN THE IN THEIR LAW CHANGE WAS A RESTRICTED THE USE OF LIKE KIND EXCHANGE DEFERRALS TO JUST APPLY TO REAL PROPERTY WE ARE PROPOSING WE CONFIRM CONFORM TO THAT? THAT SAME LIMITATION. THE FOURTH ITEM PERTAINS TO EMPLOYEE FRINGE BENEFITS OF THAT ARE PROVIDED BY BUSINESSES BY EMPLOYERS THAT ARE NOT TAX TO THE EMPLOYEE. AND THAT IS -- THAT'S THE FOURTH ITEM. ON THE ON THE LIST AND IT RAISES A HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SO WHAT THE FEDERAL LAW DID WAS IT LIMITED THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES. TO DEDUCT THESE TYPE OF EXPENSES -- THIS PARTICULAR PERTAINING TO A CERTAIN MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT AND TO TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS AND AGAIN WE PROPOSE CONFORM TO THOSE LIMITATIONS. SO WITH THAT. MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE BUSINESS TO USE. IT WOULD IT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WOULD -- IS THE BEST YOU'VE YOU'VE SO YOU'VE SO FOR INSTANCE -- ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES. THAT OF WERE PROVIDED TO A TO A EMPLOYEE. IN THE PASSWORD DEDUCT 50% OF THOSE WOULD BE DEDUCTIBLE NOW WORSE NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID NUMBER TODAY AND WE'RE SAYING. THAT WE WOULD ALSO. I'VE ALREADY HAD TO REACH OUT THINGS AND AND RE VALUE. PROVIDING THESE BENEFITS THAT ARE NOT. TO GET OF CLOSING THAT WE CONFORM TO THAT. QUICK QUESTION SO IT. WITH THESE CONFORMITY MEASURES PARTICULAR LAST ONE ARE WE CONFORMING -- TO EXACTLY MODEL FEDERAL FEDERAL LAW. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A IF A BUSINESS HAD A WORKING LUNCHEON AND PURCHASE LUNCH FOR ITS EMPLOYEES. OF WITH WITH THAT INCLUDES INCOME TO THE EMPLOYEE. NO -- IN WOULD BE DEDUCTIBLES THAT QUESTION YEAH I WOULD NOT BE IT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED AS AS COMPENSATION TO THE EMPLOYEE AND AND NEITHER BEDS NOR ARE PROPOSAL DO THAT -- BUT WE WOULD IT WOULD NO LONGER BE TODAY. IN ITS NOT DEDUCTIBLE UNDER FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAURIE NOTES RIGHT. OKAY. LET CHANGE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WAS MADE DO YOU KNOW WHEN AND HOW WITH THOSE IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TAX SEVEN JOBS ACT YEAH. HOW MANY SENSE OF WHAT IMPACT? THAT HAS HAD -- ON THE BUSINESSES IN THOSE -- PRESUMABLY IT IS GOING TO MAKE. MY THIS IS JUST MY I GUESS I HAVE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE DATA MY GUESS IS THAT. IF YOU'RE ALREADY PROVIDING THOSE BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO TAKE THOSE AWAY. BUT IF YOU'RE A NEW BUSINESS ARE YOU MAY THINK TWICE BEFORE PROVIDING THOSE THOSE BENEFITS. YEAH I'M JUST HAVING COME OUT OF THE HOT TELEVISION THE STREET. IT'S A OF VERY LARGE SOME PERCENTAGE. OF OF THE BUSINESS IS FROM THE ABILITY TO TAKE THOSE BUSINESS PROTECTIONS. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO IF THERE'S ANY. YEAH I I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DATA. ON ON THE MARGIN THERE WILL BE SOME MOVEMENT AWAY FROM THAT I HOW BIG THAT IMPACT. AND THE AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE -- POINTING TO THAT IT WOULD. TO THE EXTENT OF I THINK IS A HUNDRED SIXTY HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION UHHUH UHHUH. THAT'S BASED ON WHAT THAT IS BASED OF THESE OF THESE RESTAURANTS TAN BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND THIS ONE I AND I ON LOOKING AT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTIMATED THAT THEY WOULD GET AND THEN TAKING CAL YOUNG PRO RATED CALIFORNIA BASED ON OUR SHARE OF THE POPULATION. AND OUR TAX RATES [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OKAY -- SO THE FIFTH ITEM IS A CHANGE IN THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION -- TO TOP EMPLOYEES OF BY PUBLIC CORPORATIONS. CAN FOR PRIOR IN FEDERAL FOR PRIOR FEDERAL ENCOURAGE STATE LAW -- WE WE AT EMPLOYERS PUBLIC CORPORATIONS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DEDUCT -- COMPENSATION OVER A MILLION DOLLARS ME TOO A THIRD CERTAIN TOP EMPLOYEES -- THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION FOR PERFORMANCE SPACE -- PAYMENTS SENSHI STOCK OPTIONS. THE FEDERAL TAX BILL ELIMINATED THIS EXCEPTION FOR PERFORMANCE BASED PAY AND THEN EXPAND THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OF TOP EMPLOYEES FROM. FOUR TO FIVE AND IT ALSO EXPENSE TYPE OF COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THIS LIMITATION. I'M AND WE'RE PROPOSING CONFORMING -- OF TO THAT PROVISION OF AND THAT IS EXPECTED. OF THAT'S ABOUT SIX UP I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN [inaudible] TWENTY TWENTY ONE REYES OKAY OKAY. SIXTH AND SEVENTH ITEMS OF FLIGHT ABLE ACCOUNTS ABLE COUNTS OR OR ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE COUNTS FOR PERMITTED. BY FEDERAL LAW IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AS A TAX ADVANTAGED SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. A CALIFORNIA CONFRM TO THE TO THE ASSEMBLY FROM TO BE ABLE TO COUNT. THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT EXPANDED THOSE ACCOUNTS BY ALLOWING BENEFICIARIES OF THE COUNTS TO CONTRIBUTE UP TO THE POVERTY LEVEL. TO ENABLE ACCOUNT IN ADDITION THE FEDERAL LAW ALLOWED FIVE TWENTY NINE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS BE ROLLED OVER INTO ABLE INTO THE ABLE COUNTS -- WE PROPOSING CONFORMING IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND I SHOULD JUST IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE REVENUE DID. FOR IT THE REVENUE IS IS LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS -- AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST THERE. I AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THESE OF RULES ON ON TAX DEFERRED SAVINGS ACCOUNTS COMPARABLE BETWEEN FEDERAL STATE SO THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T FALL THE TRAP OF WITH THE STATE OF NON QUALIFIED PLAN. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE FEDERAL SO -- PLATFORM POSING CONFORMITY ON THAT. THE EIGHTH ITEM THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WON THE RACE MOST REVENUE -- THAT'S EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- ALL -- IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS TO USE BUSINESS LOSSES TO OFFSET NON BUSINESS INCOME. THE TAX CAN JOBS ACT ONLY ALLOWS. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A BUSINESS LOSSES FOR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR JOINT RETURN. TO BE USED AS AN OFFSET AGAINST NON BUSINESS INCOME. SUCH AS WAGES INTEREST DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS SO IF YOU'VE GOT BUSINESS LOSSES YOU CAN OFFSET AS MUCH BUSINESS INCOME AS YOU WANT. BUT IF YOU'VE MET YOUR BUSINESS INCOME LOSSES TOGETHER AND YOU END UP WITH FIVE HUNDRED BUT WITH WITH. LET'S SAY A MILLION DOLLARS. OF NET BUSINESS LOSSES YOU CAN ONLY USE. UP. TO FIVE JOINT RETURN UP TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THAT TO OFFSET YOUR OTHER INCOME. TO WE PROPOSE CONFORMING AND ON THIS CASE THE CONFORMITY ISN'T ISN'T PRECISE OF PRECISELY THE SAME AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE WE WE PROPOSED DOING. IS LIMITING ONCE YOU ONCE YOU HAVE AN IN THAT EXAMPLE YOU'D HAVE YOU'D USE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND KERN YOU'RE YOU AND YOU HAVE A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR ACCESS. OF BUSINESS LOST JERRY FORD WE'RE PROPOSING THAT THE USE OF THAT CARRY FORWARD IS ALSO LIMITED BY THAT SAME FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE FEDERAL RULE BECAUSE THEY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY CHANGE THEIR NET OPERATING LOSS RULES SO THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN CARRIED OVER WITH ALL YOUR WITH ANY OTHER NET OPERATING LOSSES YOU HAVE. BUT IN THAT IN FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR FOR THEIR THEIR LAW. YOU'RE LIMITED TO ONLY OFFSET IN SEVEN YEARS 80% SO WE'RE BOTH. WHAT WE'RE DOING SIMILAR TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING IN TERMS OF LIMITING YOUR USE AND SUCH FOR YEARS? IT'S JUST THEY THEY TOTALLY REVAMPED THEIR NET OPERATING LOSS RULES AND WE ARE -- WE'RE SIMPLY. LIMITING THE USE OF RATHER RATHER CHANGING ALL OR AND AND WILL RULES FOR SIMPLY SAYING THIS PARTICULAR LOS. SUBJECT -- TO TO LIMITATIONS THE CENTER MAY I ASK WOULD WITH THIS RESULT IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT BOOST REVENUES THE CALIFORNIA THOUGH. YES. HERE'S ONE OF MY POINTS THEN I WOULD SUGGEST ADMINISTRATION IN ARTICULATING THIS IDEA. STOP CALLING IT CONFORMITY. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NOT CONFORMITY OKAY. AND AND THAT'S DECEPTIVE JUST CALL IT THE NEW PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD PREFER THAT THAT'S JUST MY TWO BITS WERE. I'VE I'VE BY APPRECIATE THAT BUT I I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT IS THAT WE ARE CONFORMED AND AND IF. YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE WE ARE IN FACT CONFORMING. TO TO A SECTION OF FEDERAL CODE. WITH A WITH EXCEPT WITH TO HAS A COMMON. NOT. THAT'S JUST MY PROOF THAT YOU DID DON'T. YOU KNOW TAKE THAT AS A CRITICISM YOU SORT ALL I KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION -- MORE GENERALLY SPEAKING TO THE WORLD OUT THERE. WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THIS IN A NICE IN PLACE THAT WE DEAL WITH HERE BUT VERBIAGE AND WORDS DO MEAN THINGS? THAT I'M FUSSING ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME CHOOSE ME. IT JUST ALONG THE LINES OF SENATOR. THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN EXERCISE THAT YOU DO WE GO THROUGH THIS EVERY TIME THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE FEDERAL ON LAW RIGHT RIGHT. AND WE WE LOOK AT IT TO SEE ARE WE GOING TO CONFORM THE SAME OR NOT OR SOME PUT RIGHT HYBRID OR WHATEVER RIGHT ENDS AND SOME ISSUES. THAT SOME THINGS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES. CONFORMITY MAY NOT MAY OR MAY NOT MAY NOT MATTER MAY NOT REALLY TRIED ANY SIMPLICITY AND OTHER CASES IN THE YOU KNOW PARTICULAR IN THE IN THE ACCOUNTING RULES IN THE THE PARTNERSHIP TERMINATION THERE I THINK IT IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT -- FOR FISHER TAX ADMINISTRATION THAT WE DO IT -- SO IT IT REALLY IS. REALLY IT IT'S GOOD THAT THE STATE HAS SOME FLEXIBILITY IN DECIDING WHAT TO CONFORM TO BUT YS GENERALLY. WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES A A MAJOR TAX OVERHAUL -- OR EVEN EVEN MORE FOR MINOR CHANGES IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THAT AND AND SEE WHAT SORT OF THINGS WE NEED TO CONFORM. TO OKAY SO THE NINTH ITEM ON THE LIST. IS A LIMITATION ON THE DEDUCTION FOR FTA SEE PREMIUMS AND THAT OF THAT. IS LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE IF THE RACE IS ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION IN -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO. ESSENTIALLY WHAT WHAT WHAT THIS DOES IS UNDER PRIOR FEDERAL LONG CURRENT STATE LAW. ALL FTA SEE PREMIUMS WHICH ARE PREMIUMS PAID BY BANKS TO INSURE DEPOSITS ARE DEDUCTIBLE. THE FEDERAL LAW CHANGE TO MAKE THE PREMIUMS NOT THE DUCTAL FOR LARGE BANKS THOSE FACETS OVER FIFTY BILLION. AND AND TO REDUCE PRODUCTION ALLOWED FOR BANKS WITH ASSETS BETWEEN TEN BILLION FIFTY BILLION WE PROPOSE CONFORMING TO THE FISH. THE THE TENTH ITEM -- THAT WE'RE WE'RE PROPOSING IS ELIMINATION OF A SEPARATE SECTION THREE THIRTY EIGHT ELECTION. SECTION THREE THIRTY EIGHT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO TO ALLOW TAXPAYER. WHO PURCHASES CORPORATION TO THINK OF ONE CORPORATION PURCHASING ANOTHER CORPORATION? TO TREAT A PURCHASE OF OF THE CORPORATION STOCK HAS A PURCHASE INSTEAD. OF THE ASSETS OF THE CORPORATION. SO WHAT MAKES TO MAKE THAT. THE TO THE RELEASE OF SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE THERE ACTUAR SOME TAX CONSEQUENCES AS TO WHERE THE WERE THAT THE SALE OF OF WHERE THAT INCOME IS CITED WHICH STATED CITED. TO SO -- BY ALLOWING A SEPARATE ELECTION WHICH WE DO WHICH CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY DOES RIGHT NOW. FOR STATE PURPOSES THAT DIFFERS FOM THE ELECTION THE TAXPAYER MAY MAKE FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES HE CREATES HOSPITALS POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR INCOME TO AVOID BEING TAX BY ANY STATE SO WE'RE PROPOSED REQUIRED JUST REQUIRE THE TEXTURES WHATEVER ELECTION MAKE THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEY MAKE THE SAME. ELECTION AT STATE LEVEL. AND I THINK. OKAY NO THE SAP. THAT IS EXPECTED -- THANKS AGAIN AND HAVE BEEN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE -- DISAFFECTED RING SIXTY FIVE MILLION AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THE TWELVE ITEM AGAIN IS FAIRLY SMALL -- IT'S IT'S TOWARDS BOTTOM LIST -- LOSS OF EXPECTED TO E A LOSS OF ONE MILLION. AND THAT RELATES THE TREATMENT OF STUDENT LOANS JUST CHARGE ON ACCOUNT OF DISABILITY OR DEATH -- GENERALLY -- FORGIVENESS OF ALONE IN TAX LAW IS TREATED AS INCOME TO THE PERSON WHO'S DEBT IS FORGIVEN -- UNDER THE NEW FEDERAL LAW. ANY STUDENT DEBT. THAT IS FOR GIVEN. UP ON ACCOUNT OF DISABILITY OR DEATH IS NOT CONSIDERED INCOME AND WE PROPOSED CONFORMING TO THAT THE TREATMENT. THE FINAL ITEM I WANT TO TALK VOTERS OPPORTUNITIES OWNS OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT CREATED OPPORTUNITIES OWNS UP FOR A LITTLE BACKGROUND. ON ON THE ALL STATE WERE ALLOWED TO DESIGNATE OPPORTUNITIES OWNED IN CERTAIN ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AREAS WITHIN THE STATE. CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATED IN THAT PROCESS. AND LAST SPRING DESIGNATED EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. INVESTMENT IN OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IS ENCOURAGED BY SEVERAL FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVES. THE FIRST INCENTIVE IS A TEMPORARY DEFERRAL OF ANY GAINS IF A TAXPAYER REINVEST THOSE GAINS. IN A QUALIFIED OPPORTUNITIES AND FUND WITHIN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OF REALIZING THE GAME. IF THOSE GAMES ARE HELD IN THE FUND FOR FIVE YEARS THE TAXPAYER RECEIVES A 10% EXEMPTION WHEN THE GAME IS REALIZED. IF THE GAMES ARE HELD FOR SEVEN YEARS THE TAXPAYER RECEIVES A REALIZED. ALL THE DEFERRED GAINS MUST REALIZE ALONG WITH ANY EXEMPTION BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX IN ADDITION ANY GAINS ACHIEVED WITHIN OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUN ARE TAX FREE IF HELD FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE. WE ARE PROPOSING TO CONFORM TO THESE TAX INCENTIVES. FORT BUT ONLY FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS SO WE ARE PROPOSING THAT WE PROVIDE SIMILAR TAX INCENTIVES. HOME FOR INVESTMENTS IN OPPORTUNITIES AND FUND -- WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES ON FOOT WERE TO CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITIES OWN AND ONLY FOR CERTAIN QUALIFY TYPES OF INVESTMENTS? THE TIME TO INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD QUALIFY WOULD BE A LOW INCOME WOULD BE INVESTMENTS IN LOW INCOME HOUSING CLEAN TECHNOLOGY OR GREEN JOBS. BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL GENERAL THE GENEROUS FEDERAL TAX BREAK THAT SEEMS. VERY LIKELY THAT THAT MANY INVESTMENT DOLLARS WILL BE FLOWING INTO OPPORTUNITY ZONES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THE PURPOSE OF OUR PROPOSED CONFORMITY IS TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR VETS IN INVESTORS. MORNING OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND PROVIDE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS. TO CALIFORNIANS AND ALSO WE WANT TO DO IT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DONE IN A WAY -- WERE WERE ENCOURAGING THE RIGHT TYPE OF INVESTMENT IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- RIGHT NOW THAT THAT OF THAT SCORE HERE AS AS A AS AN EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR REVENUE LOSS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON THE REVENUE LOSS WOULD WOULD -- A. B.. IT ACTUALLY PROBABLY LESS THAN THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE SCORE THAT HAVE TO BE HAVE TO BE GAVE TO IT. WITH BEFORE WE HAD -- BEFORE LIMóN NEEDED TO TO TO A CERTAIN TYPE TO INVESTMENT TO THE PRIVATE ACTUALLY LESS INVESTMENT -- YEAH I GET AND AND AND AND SO THERE'D BE THERE'D BE REVENUE LOSSES FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO BE READ BIG REVENUE GAIN. AND THEN THERE BE MORE REVENUE LOSSES IN THE OUT YEARS AFTER. OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN HELD FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE SO -- MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE WITH THIS IS THAT. UNLESS THERE'S MORE SPECIFIC. YOU KNOW WE CAN REALLY GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS. AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS TO BE MEANINGFUL -- IT DOESN'T WORK AND BASICALLY WE JUST. YOU KNOW GIVING A TAX OF YOU KNOW TAX CREDIT HERE SURE I'M USING THAT TERM LOOSELY I'M NOT THE PROFESSIONAL HERE. BUT OF I'VE JUST SEEN SO MANY PROGRAMS WHERE THE TERMINOLOGY IS SO BROAD. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IT'S TRULY AN INVESTMENT. THAT'S WORTHY OF US USING THAT REVENUE. WHAT I CAN SAY THAT WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD ON THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE AND WE'RE VERY VERY COGNIZANT OF THE NEED TO MAKE DEFINITIONS VERY CLEAR AND AND PRECISELY WE GET? SO WE WE GET THE TYPES INVESTMENTS THAT WE WANT -- NOT. JUST ON AND ON A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WE WE HAVE PUBLISHED. LANGUAGE FOR EVERYTHING ALL THE PROVISIONS RIGHT NOW THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AS WELL AS THE AS WELL AS ALL THE CONFORM YOUR PRISONS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE OPTIMISM BECAUSE WE ARE. WORKING WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY TIGHT LANGUAGE. AND UNDER WHICH DEPARTMENT WITH BILLS ALL. WOULD THE OPPORTUNITIES ON HOW WOULD WHO WOULD BE ON THE RENTAL VEHICLE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WOULD ADMINISTER THE THE TAX BREAKS A HAN [inaudible] OF I I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I KNOW THAT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I I THINK -- HOW? I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A TO F. T.. I YOU KNOW I I THAT'S GOOD I I'VE BEEN THINKING OF TO BE WITH WOULD BE -- AUDITING -- BUT BUT I WILL -- I'LL GET BACK OKAY. I MEAN YOU KNOW THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE SUCH A BIG ISSUE ALL THESE ALL THESE. ARE BIG ISSUES BUT ARE WE REALLY GOING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT SO I ALWAYS FIND IF YOU DON'T HAVE. THE COMPLIANCE AND YOU HAVEN'T. BEEN AGENCY THAT'S REALLY GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT JUST BEING USED AS A WAY. UPDATE TAX YES. OKAY GOOD POINT [inaudible] OF WE HAVE OKAY CAN I JUST I JUST WHAT I JUST WANNA TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE REVENUE SO -- SO YOU NOTICE THAT THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE TABLE ON PAGE THIRTY TWO CHOSE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN. THE NINETEEN TWENTY AND ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE MORE WORKING WITH HAVE TO BE TO GET OUT LONGER RANGE REVENUE AUSTIN SO WE KNOW WITHOUT LONG TERM AND ALSO TO GET. REVENUES MORE CLOSELY TIED WITH WITH THE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE. ALSO THESE NUMBERS MAY CHANGE BUT BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS AS AS THE IT WAS MENTIONED. IN IN SOME OF THEIR AND THEIR ANALYSIS OF OF OUR CONFORMITY PACKAGE -- OF IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THESE REVENUE ESTIMATES THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND THEM AND AND PARTICULARLY AROUND -- PROVISIONS THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE SUCH AS THE TO TO THE OPPORTUNITIES OWN SUCH AS THE LIMITATION ON THIS IS LOSS -- OFFSET -- AND SO WE WANT TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE RVENUE THAT WE THAT WE GET. IS SUFFICIENT TO TO PAY. FOR IS SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR THE EIGHTY SI NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. SO -- THAT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THESE NUMBERS -- WE WE ARE TREATING THEM WITH A LITTLE BIT OF OF WITH THE KNOWLEDGE WITH THE THAT THEY MAY NOT. EXACTLY COME TO FRUITION THANK YOU. YES PLEASE. BRAIN WHETHER FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE'LL TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF AND LOT OF THE TIME BUT THERE ARE A FEW POINTS THAT WE FEEL LIKE WE NEED. TO SO FOR FIRST ON IN REGARDS TO THE LAST POINT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAKE. WE WE DO RECOMMEND CONSIDERING THE PROPOSED EA T. C. EXPANSION SEPARATELY FROM THE ON THE PROPOSED INCOME TAX CHANGES -- THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS TO FUND -- THE EXPANSION OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND BOTH OF THESE ARE IT'S IMPORTANT POLICY CHANGES DESERVING OF YOUR CONSIDERATION AND CONSIDERATION -- IN LINE WITH WITH ALL OF THE OTHERS LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES -- MOREOVER AS AS THE DEPARTMENT JUST MENTION THE FISCAL ESTIMATES OF THE PROPOSED TAX CHANGES ARE INDEED -- HIGHLY ENDS. AND OVER TIME AND NOT ONLY WILL THE ON THE COST OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT CHANGE BUT BUT THESE ME CHANGE TO AS AS TAX FILERS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE CHANGES IN THE RULES BOTH THE FEDERAL THE STATE LEVEL. THESE WILL CHANGE OVER TIME AS WELL AS ON CHANGES IN THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION -- THE YOU KNOW WAIT IS AND AND AND AND BUSINESS INCOME WILL. CHANGING PORTRAIT OF TIME AND SO TYING THE PROGRAMS TOGETHER BECAUSE PROBLEM. SO YOU HAD ON REGARDING THE PROPOSED TAX CHANGES YOU HAD ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT TAX CONFORMITY -- VERY BROADLY AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION SO. GENERALLY I'M STATES FROM LINCOLN THEIR INCOME TAX LAWS OF MOST STATES DUE TO THE FEDERAL TAX LAWS AND THERE'S VARIOUS REASONS FOR THIS WEEK. THE STATE TAX AGENCIES CAN AND FILERS CAN RELY ON REGULATIONS FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND TAX -- TAX RULINGS TO GUIDE THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX LAWS BOTH AT NOT ONLY THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT ALSO STATE LEVEL AND SO. FOLLOWING ANY MAJOR FEDERAL TAX CHANGES STATES OFTEN DO -- IT MAKE CHANGES TO THE STATE TAX LOSS TO CONFORM SO -- FOR EXAMPLE FOLLOWING THE LAST MAJOR OVERHAUL OF THIS THE FEDERAL LAWS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX CALIFORNIA PASSED A COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM. BILL IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AT THIS POINT -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS MAY HAVE CHANGED BUT ONLY ARIZONA CALIFORNIA MINNESOTA HAVE NOT YET ACTED IN RESPONSE THE FEDERAL TAX CHANGES AND SO -- EARLIER IN THE YEAR WE DID PREPARE -- AN ANALYSIS OF TAX CONFORMITY GENERALLY AND SO ON THE TABLE IN YOUR AGENDA -- PROVIDES SORT OF OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S TAX GOOD FOR YOU PROPOSALS WE UNDERSTOOD IT IN MARCH ON MARCH FIRST -- AND UNTIL RECENTLY THE DETAILS OF THESE THIS PROPOSAL WERE UNCLEAR -- AND AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTION SOME OF THE DETAILS OF STILL NOT BEEN BEEN PROVIDED TO US SO WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAS POSTED YESTERDAY -- BUT WE DID WANT TO MAKE. JUST A FEW. COMMENTS ABOUT -- SOME THE LARGER -- OR MORE -- PROMINENT PROVISIONS -- WE UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO NON CORPORATE BUSINESS LOSSES MAY DIFFER FROM THE THE CHANGES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ADDRESS THAT PRETTY WELL -- HOWEVER WE DO NOT YET FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THOSE DIFFERENCES. OUR AND SO -- WE'RE STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR GOOD -- ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST TO THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO LIKE KIND EXCHANGE RULES BUT GENERALLY -- WE DO FIND -- ON THE ON THE MORE STRICT ITEMS THAT ARE ARE STRICTLY CONFORMING TO FEDERAL CHANGES -- GENERALLY FAVOR. WE FIND THIS PAPER -- LASTLY THERE HAVE -- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS VERY GENERALLY ABOUT ADOPTING THE NEW FEDERAL OPPORTUNITY ZONE TAX BENEFITS BUT WE DO NOT YET HAVE THE DETAILS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SO DON'T HAVE -- MUCH MUCH OF AN OPINION ABOUT AT THIS POINT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ENTER I ONCE I I'D NEGLECTED TO MENTION ONE OF OUR ONE OF OUR CONFORMANCE THAT IS NOT OPERATING LOSSES. SO -- GENERALLY IF YOU HAVE A LOSS AND THAT IS -- THAT IS. AND THE SECOND ITEM ON THE LIST RAISES TWO HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS. INTO THE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE GENERALLY IF YOU HAVE A LOSS WHEN YOU'RE YOU CAN USE THAT OFFSET INCOME IN ANOTHER YEAR. IT'S A WAY OF EVENING OUT TAX PAYMENTS FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE MORE. OF IS INCOMES FOR CYCLICAL. ARM. AND AND WHAT UP. UNDER PRIOR FEDERAL LAW CURRENT STATE LAW -- YOU'RE ALLOWED TO CARRY BACK THOSE LOSSES TO THE PRIOR TWO YEARS AND AND ALSO TAXES TO GET TAX REFUND FOR TAXI. FORTY EIGHT OR ALTERNATELY TO CARRY IT FORWARD AND ALSO TAXES IN FUTURE YEARS WITH THE FEDERAL GOOD GOVERNMENT DID. IS THEY SAID WE'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE KERRY BACKS. AND WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT WHEN YOU WHEN ON KERRY FORGERY LIMIT YOU TO ONLY OFFSET 80% OF THAT YEAR'S INCOME. SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THAT WE CONFORM TO THE ELIMINATION OF KERRY BACKS BUT THAT WE DO NOT CONFORM TO THE 80% LIMITATION GOING FORWARD. AND THEN AND THEN ONE OTHER THING I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND ON ON WHY WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE THESE -- BE TREATED THE SAME ARE THAT THAT THE EIGHTY SI AND CONFORM TO BE TREATED AS ONE PACKAGE THAT IS THAT. WHAT WE OWE IT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP AND BUDGET THAT BALANCE AND RESILIENT? AND WE REALLY NEED A WAY. TO PAY FOR THE EITC BOTH THE EXPANSION. AND THE THE CURRENT AHC WITH UNDER. UNDER -- AS IT IS RIGHT NOW THE THE THE THE WAY TO DO THE ONLY WAY TO PAY FOR THAT WOULD BE WITH A CONFORMITY. JUST JUST REMIND ME IN TERMS OF THE THE CONFORMITY -- THE TOTAL. FOR THE CHANGE IN IN REVENUE THE CARD RIGHT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE SEVEN AND ONE FOR YEAH I DID I I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ON GOING IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN THE IN THE ONE POINT. FOUR BILLION DOLLAR RANGE. BUT AGAIN AS AS YOU'LL USE POINT OF THOSE OF THOSE ARE VERY UNCERTAIN REVENUES AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT REVENUE. TO A POINT THAT OF DISCONNECTING IT -- I COULD I COULD SEE THAT IF WE IMPLEMENT THE EXPANSION OF THE I. T. C. THEN SOMETHING. WHAT THE REVENUE EXPECTED HERE THAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WE GO BACK AND AND AND WE AND WE SAY THEIR LINK THE V. THE? THE ADOPTION WOULD BE LIKE IT'S WE WOULD NOT BE TRACKING IN FACT FOR SOME THESE ARE NOT IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO REALLY TRACK IN REAL TIME. THE REVENUE RAISING THESE PROVISIONS SO IT WOULD JUST BE. ONE WORD WOULD BE DOING A A FORECAST OF OF HOW MUCH REVENUES CAN COME IN AND OUT OF WITH THE CONFORMING ITEMS. HOW MUCH REVENUE IS GOING TO BE GOING OUT WITH YOUR EXPAND EXPANDED IN CURRENT ARNED TAX CREDIT? AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- THAT THEIR CUT THAT IT'S BEING COVERED. YOU KNOW IN IN SUCH ONE DEPENDENT ON THE OTHER PROGRAM DISAPPEARS OR THE EXPANSION YEAH YES. THERE'S A LOT YEAH YEAH THAT WOULD BE TIED IN AND YOU KNOW. IN IN REALITY. THE WHEN THE NEXT RECESSION COMES. THAT THAT'S GONNA HURT RECENT REVENUES GOING TO GO DOWN REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO IS CONFORM AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO EVALUATE A PRIORITIES. HOPEFULLY WE'VE GOT ENOUGH YOU KNOW IN IN RAINY DAY FUND. TO TO COVER THAT BUT BUT THE THE THE FLUCTUATIONS WE HAVE HERE. MOVE WOULD REALLY BE DWARFED BY WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE. ANY OF THE THE FLUCTUATION BETWEEN WHAT WE ACTUALLY GET FROM THESE PROVISIONS AND WHAT WE EXPECTED WITH BE TOWARD. BUT WHAT WE WOULD SEE AN A ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THAT I'M SURE IF IT IF IT HELPS -- THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS IS PREDICATED ON BOTH OF THESE THE EXPANSION AND AND IS HAPPENING SO THEY THEY'VE LINK THEM. AND SO THAT'S I I BELIEVE HOW I UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MEETING. THAT THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO DO BOTH IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE FOR THE I. T. C. BECAUSE A THIS ASSUME THAT IN THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS BOTH OF BOTH OF THESE THINGS HAPPENING. IN OUR POINT IS ONLY THAT. THAT. THAT YOU YOU YOU IT AS THE LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER THESE OPTIONS -- IN AN HOLE KEEPING IN MIND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF REVENUES WILL BE AFFECTED BY BOTH OF THESE OPTIONS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. I THINK WE'RE READY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY SINCE I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE SENATORS. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- L. WESTERN CENTER ON LAW PARTY DESK OF OUR HELLO -- WE ARE INCOME AND SUPPORT OF THE CONFORMITY MENTIONED TO US WANNA A STATE THAT PUBLICLY -- AND ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN LISTENING TO OUR COMMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WE SHARE CONCERNS OF VOICE BY THE CHAIRWOMAN AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING. WITH YOU ON THAT LANGUAGE OUT SINCE YOU MENTIONED IT -- WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT AS WE THINK ABOUT THE NEXT RECESSION -- REMEMBER THAT THE POOREST WILL GET HURT THE MOST. AND ALSO THAT CALIFORNIA'S GREAT AUSTERITY THE FACT THAT WE WERE MORE OBSCURE THAN MOST OTHER STATES IN THIS -- IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE LAST RECESSION -- RESULTED IN OUR PROLONGED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. YOU A TOOK US LONGER TO RESTORE THE JOBS BECAUSE THEY WERE MUNICIPAL JOBS THAT WERE LARGELY LOST IN THOSE MUNICIPAL JOBS WERE HARD TO COME BACK THIS IS NOT MY ANALYSIS THIS IS THE ANALYSIS OF OF MOODY'S ECONOMISTS. THE CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIST WHO IF YOU YOU CAN GO BACK AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT. HOW LONG IT TOOK CALIFORNIA I MEAN NOW WE ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE MOST OF THE GROWTH IN? IN JOBS IN THE ECONOMY -- AND AT AND EVERY QUARTER EVERY MONTH WE HAVE MORE JOBS GROW SENATE THAN THAN OTHER STATES AND THEN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND SO WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF OURSELVES. BUT AS WE THINK ABOUT THE NEXT RECESSION. ENSURE THAT THE MONEY CONTINUES TO FLOW OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY THROUGH EITC INTERTEXTUAL IT'S IS GONNA BE ONE OF THE WAYS WE KEEP OUR ECONOMY GOING. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THEM WE APPRECIATE THE COMPLEX TASK THAT YOU IN THT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT IS GRAPPLING WITH IN TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE AND WE DO SUPPORT MOST OF THE FEDERAL CONFORMITY ITEMS. LIKE YOU WERE WAITING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO RECEIVING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ON OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND WHAT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND -- HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS WORKING TO TRY TO FRAME THIS IN A WAY? THAT WOULD BE AT NO COST BENEFIT FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED -- WE DO ASK THAT AS YOUR EXPLORING -- SOMETHING THAT'S NOT BEING CONSIDERED TODAY BUT YOU LOOK FOR AN INCREASE EFFICIENCIES WHEN IT COMES THAT THE UTILIZATION OF TAX CREDITS. WHEN IT COMES TO ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HAVE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS IN ENSURING THAT GOOD TAX CREDITS LIKE E. I. T. C.? CAN BE UTILIZED AN EXPANDED UP BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF THE OTHERS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT DO NOT HAVE SUNSET THAT DO NOT HAVE METRICS. FOR EFFICIENT -- FOR EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE -- THAT WE MADE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALL IN LINE WITH THE VALUES OF THE STATE WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ON THAT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU TERRY ONLY WITH ECONOMIC SECURITY PROJECT ACTION I'M WE ARE IN -- STRONG SUPPORT OF MEASURES THAT CREATE MORE TAX FAIRNESS AND MORE FAIRNESS IN OUR TAX CODE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN THE A PART WHERE IT CAN AND CREATES A TAX CODE THAT -- DOESN'T CONTINUE TO FAVOR THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE BENEFITED SO MUCH AND OF COURSE WE ARE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THE ATC MEASURES -- I THINK IT'S CHALLENGING TO THINK ABOUT -- CONNECTING THEM AND I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU ALL TO TALK ABOUT BUT I THINK THAT FROM A FROM A CONFORMITY PERSPECTIVE -- MEASURES TO CREATE FAIRNESS ARE ARE SOMETHING WE REALLY FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND. GOOD THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO IN THE MEDIA -- ANYBODY ELSE. NO. THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND BAM
