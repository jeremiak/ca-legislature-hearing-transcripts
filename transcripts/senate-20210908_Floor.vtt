ANYTHING ABOUT KOREA. AND IT

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.059
REALLY WASN'T UNTIL COLLEGE AND

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:49.528
BEYOND. THAT I LEARNED WHY THEY

IN THE NEWS ABOUT ETHNIC

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:38.130
STUDIES AS IT IS COUPLED WITH

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:39.331
CRITICAL RACE THEORY WHICH IS

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:41.333
REALLY WHAT PARENTS ACROSS THIS

THEY GO TOGETHER. AND THAT IS

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.247
THE REASON WHY YOU'VE SEEN SO

00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:56.615
MANY SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:58.483

NATION WHERE PARENTS ARE UP IN

ARMS ABOUT THIS TYPE OF

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:03.088
IDEOLOGY BEING TAUGHT TO THEIR

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:05.557
CHILDREN. I THINK THERE ARE

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:07.659
CERTAINLY MANY MEMBERS OF THIS

00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:09.895
BODY WHO HAVE THEIR IDEA OF

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.396
WHAT IT IS TO TEACH ETHNIC

00:22:11.463 --> 00:22:12.597
STUDIES AND THAT IT IS

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:14.433
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY BENIGN.

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:16.368
THAT WE'RE JUST TEACHING-

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:18.370
CULTURAL HISTORY AND IT'S

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:20.906
SOMETHING TO BE LAUDED BUT IF

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:22.507
YOU DIG DEEPER INTO WHAT

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.176
CRITICAL RACE THEORY TEACHERS

00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:25.510
ARE YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK HE

00:22:25.577 --> 00:22:28.680
WOULD- PERHAPS THINK OTHERWISE.

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:30.916
AS AN EXAMPLE IN CUPERTINO

00:22:30.982 --> 00:22:33.018

THEY HAVE. TAKEN PART IN

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:17.529
OPPRESSING OTHERS THIS IS NOT

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:19.598

HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:38.697
COLLEAGUE AND I SAID. I

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:41.566
RECOUNTED THE TIME WHEN- I WAS

TRAUMA. WE WILL NEVER GET TO A

00:26:57.882 --> 00:27:00.618
PLACE OF PEACE. AND I THINK

00:27:00.685 --> 00:27:02.320
THIS IS WHAT WE TRY TO

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:06.391
ACCOMPLISH WITH EIGHTY ONE OH

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.093
ONE. RECOGNIZING THE TRAUMAS OF

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:09.194
ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.696
INTEGRAL OR WHOSE STORIES ARE

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:13.365
INTEGRAL TO WHAT THIS BILL IS

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:16.601
TRYING TO ALLOW IT TO BE SHARED

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:19.637
TWO YOUNG FOLKS. IN A WAY THAT

00:27:19.704 --> 00:27:24.376
IS HONEST. YOU KNOW. THE

00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:26.678
REALITY IS THAT IT IS AS

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.713
IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.682
BEING TAUGHT AS IT IS TO HAVE

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:32.183
DISCUSSIONS AROUND WHO IS

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.685
TEACHING IT AND HOW THAT WILL

00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:36.554
BE TALKED. THIS IS NOT GONNA IN

00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:40.792
CULTURE WARS. BUT THIS IS ALSO

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:44.929
NOT ABOUT. IT'S NOT REALLY

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:47.198
ABOUT RACE IT'S ABOUT HISTORY

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:49.067
AND THE FACT THAT FOR SO LONG

00:27:49.134 --> 00:27:51.536
SO MANY PARTS OF OUR UNITED

00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:54.606
STATES AMERICAN HISTORY HAS

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.608
BEEN PUSHED TO THE SIDELINES.

00:27:56.674 --> 00:27:57.976
AND TALKING ABOUT RACE CAN BE

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:04.649
DONE. WITHOUT SHAMING PEOPLE.

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:07.118
WITHOUT BEING ACCUSATORY AND

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:09.654
WITHOUT BEING DIVISIVE. AND IF

00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.356
FOLKS ARE SO AFRAID TO TALK

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:14.392
ABOUT RACE. THEN I WOULD JUST

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:16.428
ASK YOU TO LEAN DEEPER IN

00:28:16.494 --> 00:28:18.363
BECAUSE YOU'VE PROBABLY TOUCHED

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.298
ON A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:22.767
VULNERABLE POINTS. AND WHO YOU

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:27.906
ARE. THAT NEEDS TO BE FURTHER

00:28:27.972 --> 00:28:33.845
DISSECTED. I EIGHTY ONE OH ONE

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:35.046
AND IS ABOUT ASKING FOLKS TO

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:37.082
TAKE THE BLINDERS OFF WE

00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:38.583
SHOULDN'T BE WHITEWASHING

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:43.621
HISTORY SO THAT IT'S- BIAR.

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:44.789
THROUGH THE ENTIRE COURSE OF

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:47.158
THIS EXISTENCE OF THIS COUNTRY

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:49.594
BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN. AND

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:51.362
LEARNING THAT DOESN'T CREATE

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:55.433
DIVISION. HOPEFULLY IT CREATES

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.203
OPPORTUNITY FOR REFLECTION. A

00:28:58.269 --> 00:29:01.005
NEW WAYS OF TALKING ABOUT FOLKS

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:02.040
AND HISTORIES THAT YOU DON'T

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:04.342
KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT BUT AT

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.777
SOME POINT WE HAVE TO STOP

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:07.679
BEING AFRAID. WHAT WE DON'T

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:13.017
KNOW. AND I'M REALLY INTERESTED

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.086
IN YOUNG PEOPLE HAVING ALL OF

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:16.287
THE INFORMATION AT THEIR

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:19.057
DISPOSAL. ABOUT HOW THIS

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:22.193
COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ABOUT WHO

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.296
HELPED TO MAKE IT GREAT. IT

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:26.931
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO SPEND ALL

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:28.166
OF OUR TIMES DURING THESE

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:30.101
COMMEMORATIVE DAYS WITH OUR

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:31.503
FLOOR SPEECHES TALKING ABOUT

00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:34.739
FOLKS. THEY'RE NOT TAUGHT IN

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:43.548
OUR SCHOOLS. SO I RISE IN

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:46.217
SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE OH ONE.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.619
BECAUSE THESE INCREMENTAL STEPS

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:52.423
TOWARDS HONESTY. ARE THE STEPS

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.859
THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING. WITH

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:57.362
SOME MORE FORCEFULNESS AND SOME

00:29:57.428 --> 00:30:01.900
MORE CONFIDENCE. SO THANK YOU

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:04.302
AND WITH THAT I'D ASK FOR AN

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:07.138
IDOL FOR EIGHTY ONE OH ONE

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:09.674
THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. THANK

STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ONE A

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.947
ONE AND I MOSTLY WANT TO THINK-

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.515
THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:19.817
MEDINA FOR HIS DOG AND WORK ON

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:21.886
THIS ISSUE. EVER SINCE I'VE

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:23.922
BEEN HERE IN THE US SENATE-

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:24.956
BEFORE WAS THE CHAIRPERSON

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:26.958
EDUCATION I SET ON SENATE

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.793
EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND HE'S

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.628
ALWAYS BROUGHT THE BILL FORWARD

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:32.397
I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED IT AND

00:30:32.463 --> 00:30:33.131
I'VE ALWAYS SAID THE SAME

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:34.999
THING. THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT

00:30:35.066 --> 00:30:36.701
EACH OTHER THE MORE WE WILL

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.636
REALIZE THAT WE ARE MORE ALIKE

00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:41.172
THAN WE ARE DIFFERENT. I WANT

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:41.973
TO LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.942
CULTURES I WANT MY CHILDREN TO

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.376
LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT CULTURES

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:46.744
I WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MY

00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:48.947
COMMENTS ALSO WITH. SENATOR

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:51.516
FROM LOS ANGELES THAT THIS

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.117
ISN'T JUST ABOUT GOING FORWARD

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:54.419
THIS IS ALSO ABOUT LEARNING OUR

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:56.487
HISTORY OUR TRUE HISTORY SO

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:58.323
ABOUT HATING ANYONE IT'S NOT

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:00.758
ABOUT HATING WHITE PEOPLE IT'S

00:31:00.825 --> 00:31:01.459
ABOUT UNDERSTANDING OUR TRUE

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:03.561
HISTORY. AND WHEN PEOPLE TALK

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:05.630
ABOUT CRITICAL RACE THEORY

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:07.932
WHICH JUST AS AN ASIDE IS NOT

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:09.934
PART OF A B. ONE OH ONE AND IS

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:12.437
NOT PART OF ETHNIC STUDIES THE

00:31:12.503 --> 00:31:13.004
DEFINITION OF CRITICAL RACE

00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:14.672
THEORY IS A BODY OF LEGAL

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:16.674
SCHOLARSHIP. AND ACADEMIC

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:18.176
MOVEMENT OF US CIVIL RIGHTS

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:20.345
SCHOLARS AND ACTIVISTS WHO SEEK

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:21.479
TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE THE

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:23.381
INTERSECTIONAL INTERSECTION OF

00:31:23.448 --> 00:31:25.483
RACE AND US LAW. AND TO

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.151
CHALLENGE MAINSTREAM AMERICAN

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:28.853
LIBERAL APPROACHES TO RACIAL

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.789
JUSTICE C. R. T. EXAMINE SOCIAL

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:33.558
SOCIAL CULTURAL AND LEGAL

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:36.194
ISSUES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:38.363
RESULT RELATE TO RACE AND

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:40.932
RACISM IN THE US. THE BASIC

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:42.133
TENANTS OF C. R. T. INCLUDE

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.735
THAT RACISM AND DESPAIR RACIAL

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.603
OUTCOMES ARE THE RESULT OF

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.205
COMPLEX CHANGING AND OFTEN

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:50.341
SUBTLE SOCIAL IN INSTITUTIONAL

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:52.777
DYNAMICS RATHER THAN. INTERNAL

00:31:52.844 --> 00:31:55.079
INTERNAL INTERNAL INTENTIONAL

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:57.348
EXCUSE ME PREJUDICES IN

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:59.217
INDIVIDUALS SO I DON'T

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:00.351
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S A BAD

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:03.121
THING SOMETIMES RACISM IS.

00:32:03.187 --> 00:32:05.089
SUBTLE SOMETIMES WE DON'T KNOW

00:32:05.156 --> 00:32:09.527
IT I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M NOT

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:10.161
BEHAVING IN A MANNER THAT WOULD

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:10.795
OFFEND SOMEONE. AND I DO AGREE.

00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:12.063
CHILDREN ARE NOT BORN RACIST

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.165
THAT'S A 100% CORRECT. BUT

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.500
CHILDREN DO LIVE WITH RACIST

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.335
PARENTS SOMETIMES IF THEY DON'T

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:18.236
LEARN SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:20.238
SCHOOL THEY WILL LEARN TO BE

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.440
RACIST I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT.

00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:24.175
AGAIN I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE

00:32:24.242 --> 00:32:26.010
MEMBER MEDINA FOR HIS DOG AND

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:27.845
WORK ON THIS AND I HOPE THAT WE

00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:29.447
WILL SEE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:31.182
DESK AND GET SIGNED I URGE A NO

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:39.824
VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WAY SO.

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:41.025
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THIS

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:43.394
DEBATE AND- I JUST WANT TO ADD

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.063
A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF THE-

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.564
ISSUE OF SCIENCE BECAUSE THIS

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:49.067
IS REALLY ABOUT EDUCATION. AND

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.368
THE WAY WE PERCEIVE SCIENCE AND

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:52.537
YOUTH I'M GLAD THAT. CRITICAL

00:32:52.603 --> 00:32:54.205
RACE THEORY WASN'T WRITTEN TO

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:55.606
THE BUILDING OF SOMEBODY RISES

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:56.908
UP AND SAY THIS IS ABOUT

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:58.810
CRITICAL RACE THEORY THERE THEY

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:01.112
DIDN'T READ THE BILL. AND YOU

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.181
HAVE TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THE

00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:03.981
CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS THAT

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:06.551
AS- ACTUALLY ONE THEORY IN

00:33:06.617 --> 00:33:07.952
SCIENCE THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.054
OTHERS AND IF. YOU KNOW ABOUT

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:11.389
SCIENCE YOU KNOW THAT SCIENCE

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:13.224
IS ALWAYS ALWAYS WORKS ON

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:16.928
CHALLENGING. OUR OWN

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:19.364
UNDERSTANDING IT'S A CONSTANT

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.833
CHALLENGE OF THE WAY WE VIEW OF

00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:23.101
THE WORLD AND THE WAY WE'VE

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.268
COME TO UNDERSTAND THINGS AND

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:26.871
IF YOU. TAKE A POSITION IN

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:28.506
SCIENCE AT THINGS ARE CERTAIN

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:31.776
WAYS YOU'LL PROBABLY. BE IN B.

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:35.580
THE- WRONG IN TERMS OF HOW HOW

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:37.882
WE WOULD VIEW. SOCIETY IN THE

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:40.852
WORLD. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:45.323
WE- INCLUDING EDUCATION IN

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.426
EVERY ASPECT OF RAISING OUR

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:49.560
CHILDREN PREPARING THEM FROM

00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:52.897
THE WORLD WE HAVE TO. RAISE

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:54.198
PEOPLE THAT- ARE ARE PROUD OF

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:56.100
WHO THEY ARE ON THE ONE HAND

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:57.301
AND ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE

00:33:57.368 --> 00:34:00.671
THAT ARE GROUNDED. IN ROME AND-

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:03.408
IN KNOWING HOW TO INVESTIGATE

00:34:03.474 --> 00:34:05.209
THINGS TO THE SCIENTIFIC

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:07.478
PRINCIPLES THAT ALLOW OUR

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:10.047
CURRENT OUR OUR WORLD TO

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:12.517
FLOURISH AND DEVELOP IN THE

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:13.484
LAST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS.

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:19.390
SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A

00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:21.159
NATION OF PEOPLE WHOSE HEADS

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:23.861
ARE IN THE SAND. IF YOU REALLY

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:27.498
WILL CHALLENGE. THE PROSPERITY

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:28.900
AND THE POSITION OF OUR COUNTRY

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:32.236
IN THE WORLD. IN A IN A IN A

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:37.208
VERY MAJOR. EXTENT SO DON'T BE

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:39.043
AFRAID OF EDUCATION DON'T BE

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.279
AFRAID OF UNDERSTANDING OTHER

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:43.381
PEOPLE I GOT A CATHOLIC

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:45.116
EDUCATION GROWING UP AND ONE OF

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:46.651
THE THINGS MY SCHOOL DID MY

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:48.252
CATHOLIC SCHOOL DID WAS TAKE ME

00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:52.657
TO LEARN. WE WENT TO A WELCOME

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:54.158
TO MOSCOW WE WENT TO A

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:56.494
SYNAGOGUE WE WENT TO A BUDDHIST

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:59.831
TEMPLE AS PART OF OUR RELIGIOUS

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:03.968
EDUCATION AND IT WAS EXTREMELY.

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:06.270
REVEALING TO ME AND IT WAS JUST

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:08.439
A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND OTHER

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:12.443
PEOPLE I COME TO RESPECT THEM.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.945
AND THAT WAS A WONDERFUL

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:15.980

AFTER YOUR LAWN MOWERS

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:17.606
GARDENERS WON'T HAVE TO BE ABLE

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:18.641
TO YOU KNOW ON ONE BILL THESE

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:20.175
GAS LAWN MOWERS GAS MEDIATORS

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:21.710
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND WE

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:22.811
WERE PRACTICALLY LAUGHED OUT OF

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:24.713
THE ROOM AND HERE WE ARE JUST A

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.081
DECADE LATER COMING AFTER LAWN

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:28.784
MOWERS AND WEED EATERS. AND I

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:30.219
THINK ABOUT HOW THIS WILL

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:32.421
AFFECT- YOU KNOW ENTREPRENEURS

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:33.622
AND START THEIR OWN ONE MORE

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:34.957
BUSINESS I THINK ABOUT A

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:36.792
NONPROFIT THAT IN BAKERSFIELD

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:37.826
HAS TAKEN THIS MEN'S RECOVERY

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:39.495
HOME AND- THEY ACTUALLY STARTED

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:40.295
A LAWN WHERE BUSINESS LOT OF

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:41.664
THINGS WERE DONATED I THINK

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.065
ABOUT RANCH PROPERTIES THAT

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:46.568
HAVE. LARGE YARDS THAT HAVE YOU

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:51.106
KNOW RIDING MOWERS. AND I ALSO

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:53.676
THINK ABOUT- HOW MANY LAWN

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:54.610
MOWERS ARE ACTUALLY IN THE

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:56.011
STATE OF CALIFORNIA CIVIC

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:57.112
THERE'S FORTY MILLION PEOPLE

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:58.681
DIVIDED BY TWO SO TWENTY

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:00.382
MILLION PEOPLE AS A COUPLE PER

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:04.219
SE A HOUSEHOLD- LET'S JUST SAY

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:05.521
THERE'S TWENTY MILLION LAWN

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:06.021
MOWERS IN THE STATE OF

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:08.157
CALIFORNIA. ELIMINATING ALL

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:09.625
THOSE LAWN MOWERS EVEN IF THERE

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:10.926
WERE THAT MANY WOULD NOT IN ANY

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.261
WAY SHAPE OR FORM ELIMINATE

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:14.229
CARBON EMISSIONS THAT COME FROM

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:16.298
ONE FIRE. AT THE CREEK FIRE

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:17.332
THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:19.001
DEVASTATING HUNTINGTON LAKE IN

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.803
THE SHAVER LAKE AREA- I GREW UP

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:23.706
THERE. AND MY MOM GREW UP AT

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:26.308
THEIR- END AND- YOU SMELL THE

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.876
WALK TO THE LAKE AND WE HAD

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.178
BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOREST

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:30.512
MANAGEMENT MITIGATION AND ALL

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:31.580
THOSE THINGS AND SEE VARIOUS

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:34.149
BILLS. FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME

01:12:34.216 --> 01:12:35.484
AND YOU SMELL THE WALK TO THE

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:36.318
LAKE BUT NOW YOU CAN'T YOU

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:37.386
COULDN'T EVEN WALK TO THE LATE

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:38.954
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO MUCH.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.190
UNDERBRUSH IN SO MANY FAN SMALL

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:43.392
TREES- THEY'RE NOT THERE

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:44.326
ANYMORE IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.028
THAT DR SEUSS BOOK NOW THE

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:47.996
LORAX WHERE ALL THE TREES ARE

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.264
GONE IN THAT BEAUTIFUL WOODED

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:53.368
MOUNTAIN AREA. SO ONE FIRE- TO

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:55.838
STOP THAT. TO STOP ONE FIRE IN

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:56.939
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.841
MITIGATE A LOT OF THE CARBON

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:01.076
EMISSIONS THAT WE HAVE- LOOK AT

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:02.911
CARBON CAPTURING NEW TECHNOLOGY

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.446
TO DO CARBON CAPTURE. AND THEN

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.414
THERE'S A BILL THAT WAS

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:06.381
FLOATING AROUND ON THE ASSEMBLY

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:08.183
SIDE. TO ELIMINATE ANY NEW

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.918
TECHNOLOGY FOR CARBON CAPTURE

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:10.986
BECAUSE THAT WOULD ALLOW WHAT

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.821
THEY CALL THE- OIL INDUSTRY TO

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:13.889
BE ABLE TO OPERATE LONGER

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:14.823
BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.425
CAPTURE. CARBON EMISSIONS. I

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.359
MEAN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE

ADDING POWER PLANTS. DO THE

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:44.086
ENERGY SUPPLY CONCERNS. THEY'LL

HAVE FIVE NEW GAS POWERED POWER

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:47.589
PLANTS THAT WE OUTLAWED

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:48.724
BASICALLY IN THE STATE OF

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.659
CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY REALIZE

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.061
THAT WE CAN'T DO THIS WE CAN'T

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:55.464
ACHIEVE 1100% RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.800
BY THAT DATE. THAT IS SET BY

01:13:57.866 --> 01:13:59.668
THIS LEGISLATURE NO MATTER WHO

AND OIL AND GAS. INDUSTRY RIGHT

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:08.977
NOW WE'RE IMPORTING IT INSTEAD

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:11.079
OF PRODUCING IT HERE. BUT THIS

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:13.182
SPECIFIC BILL OUTLAWS AND HURTS

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:14.616
SMALL BUSINESSES IT HURTS

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:15.951
INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE TO GO

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.286
OUT AND BUY A NEW ELECTRIC LAWN

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:19.087
MORE. ON THE PORTABLE EQUIPMENT

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:20.389
THE GENERATORS WE HAVE THOSE P.

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:22.724

WINTERS. AND WHEN THEY WERE OUT

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.303
OF POWER FOR FOUR FIVE AND SIX

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:35.103
DAYS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THOSE

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:37.139
PORTABLE GENERATORS. WELL THOSE

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.074
PORTABLE GENERATORS OPERATE ON

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:40.576
GASOLINE AND IF ALL OF YOUR

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.778
POWER IS OUT. IT DOESN'T MAKE

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.046
ANY SENSE HOW YOU WOULD PLUG IN

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.714

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:03.098
NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.566
CHANGE ISSUE IF YOU REALLY WANT

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:05.400

AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CLIMATE

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:15.878
CHANGE IT'S ABOUT PROBLEM

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:18.247
SOLVING. N. F. FORCE MITIGATION

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:19.081

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:20.282
BEST THINGS. AND YOU KNOW I

PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN. I

ENGAGED AND START- DEALING WITH

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:41.303
THIS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE- IN A

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.472
REALISTIC MANNER. AGAIN I THINK

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:44.606
THAT DOING PASSING THIS BILL

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.308
WILL HARM. A LOT OF OUR SMALL

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.210
BUSINESS OWNERS- AND IT WILL

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.946
COST- A REGULATORY PROCESS WILL

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:52.281
COST A LOT OF MONEY FOR THESE.

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.283
INDIVIDUALS AND IT WILL DO NEXT

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.884
TO NOTHING TO CHANGE THE

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:58.587
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE NOW.

I AM HAPPY ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:07.896
WERE TAKEN IN THE SOUTH OF

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:09.331
SUSPECTED GENERATORS BECAUSE

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.165
THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.567
COLLEAGUES- REEK WITH COMMON

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:14.403

SHUT OFFS OR OTHER THINGS

01:16:15.537 --> 01:16:17.239
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A SOURCE IN

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:19.041
THE INTERIM TO GENERATE POWER.

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:20.309
IN THE SECOND THING AND I KNOW

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.443
IT'S NOT ALWAYS POLITICALLY

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:22.644
CORRECT BUT I THINK IT'S TRUE

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:24.613
WHAT I REMEMBER IS CHAIR OF THE

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.014

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:33.455
IMPACT OF FIRES AND CLIMATE

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:36.558
CHANGE IN ON GREENHOUSE GASES

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.360
IT IS TRUE THAT THE FACT OF THE

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:39.895
MATTER IS THAT WE MADE SO MANY

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:41.463
EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS BUT WE

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.765
HAVE TO PRIORITIZE THE FIRES WE

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:45.701
LOOKING AT THE TIME IT TAKES IN

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.202

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:55.503
GETTING AN ABORTION AND TRYING

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:57.238
TO FIGURE OUT- OR HAVING A

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:58.806
MEDICAL PROCEDURE ANY MEDICAL

01:32:58.873 --> 01:33:00.808
PROCEDURE- WITHOUT YOUR PARENTS

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.910
KNOWLEDGE AND CONSULTATION. THE

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:04.946
BILL ENCOURAGES. CHILDREN TO

01:33:05.012 --> 01:33:06.614
ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES ALONE TO

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:09.116
HIDE IT FROM THEIR PARENTS- I

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:09.717
THINK THAT CREATES A DIVISION

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:12.620
BETWEEN PARENTS. AND CHILDREN-

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:13.888
I THINK THE STATE INTERFERING

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:16.157
IN RAISING CHILDREN- THESE DAYS

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:18.159
IS JUST CONTINUALLY OVER

01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:20.194
REACHING I KNOW IT ALWAYS SEEMS

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:21.062
LIKE IT'S AROUND THE ISSUE OF

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:25.366
ABORTION- SEIZURES- REGARDING

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.702
SEX- SEXUAL TRANSITIONS AND

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:28.803
THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHAT

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.638
THE- THE LANGUAGE HAS BEEN THE

01:33:30.705 --> 01:33:32.473
LAST FEW YEARS. BUT I CAN TELL

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:33.507
YOU THAT NOT ONLY PARENTS ARE

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:34.642
BEING REMOVED FOR HAVING THEIR

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:35.509
SAY IN THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:36.510
LIVES BUT THIS BILL GOES

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:37.945
FURTHER TO REQUIRE. SOME

01:33:38.012 --> 01:33:39.914
TERRORISTS TO PAY FOR THOSE AND

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:41.749
DISCLOSED PROCEDURES ARE BASED

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:44.752
ON THEIR MEDICAL INSURANCE. AND

01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:46.153
NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO PAY

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.355
FOR A BILL THAT WE HAD NO

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.190
INFORMATION ON THE BILITY. TO

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:52.226
ADDRESS- WHAT HAPPENED I THINK

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:53.828
THE MONEY IS JUST A SECONDARY

01:33:53.894 --> 01:33:54.929
THING I THINK THE ISSUE IS

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.063
BETWEEN THE PARENT AND THE

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:58.499
CHILD. AND HAVING A PARENT A

01:33:58.566 --> 01:33:59.500

01:33:59.567 --> 01:34:02.303

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:10.311
ABOUT MEDICAL ISSUES RIGHT

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:11.579
COULD YOU IMAGINE AS A PARENT

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:13.080
MOST OF US ARE PARENTS IN HERE

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:15.049
SOME OF US ARE NOT. COULD YOU

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:15.816
IMAGINE IF YOU SEND YOUR KID

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:17.385
OFF TO SCHOOL AND- AND YOU

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:18.886
DIDN'T KNOW THAT AS A TEACHER

01:34:18.953 --> 01:34:20.955

THAT CHILD LOST ITS LIFE. I

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:30.765
MEAN YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:31.866
SOME OF THESE PROCEDURES THAT

01:34:31.932 --> 01:34:34.101

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:39.774
WITHOUT THE PARENTS KNOWLEDGE.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.842

THE LIFE OF THE UNBORN WE

01:34:48.749 --> 01:34:49.650

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:02.556
VACCINES A LOT OF THE

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:04.425
MISINFORMATION COMES FROM CNN

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:07.060
MSNBC THE ADMINISTRATION. US

01:41:07.127 --> 01:41:08.996
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CONSISTENT

01:41:09.062 --> 01:41:11.398
RIGHT. FOR INSTANCE. LAST YEAR

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:12.966

THEY ARE ABOVE THE LAW AND THAT

02:05:24.383 --> 02:05:26.752
ACT IN SUCH A WAY THAT DISPLAYS

02:05:26.819 --> 02:05:29.121
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE REGARD

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:31.023
FOR THE LAW. THAT THEY WOULD

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:33.993
NOT CONTINUE IN SUCH SERVICE

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:35.761

WOULD- PERSONALLY SUPPORT A

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:55.941
POLICY OF DECERTIFICATION FOR

APPROVED IN THE ASSEMBLY OR

02:07:01.847 --> 02:07:03.082
IMPROVED ACTUALLY IN THE

02:07:03.148 --> 02:07:04.616
ASSEMBLY IT STILL HAS

02:07:04.683 --> 02:07:06.151
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT

02:07:06.218 --> 02:07:08.320
JUSTIFY A NO VOTE. THE

UNELECTED BODY OF APPOINTEES

02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:21.800
THE POST ADVISORY BOARD ITSELF

02:07:21.867 --> 02:07:23.235
IS PROBLEMATIC SINCE TWO PUBLIC

02:07:23.302 --> 02:07:24.403

02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:26.071

TRIAL OR A FAIR HEARING. I'M

02:07:35.047 --> 02:07:35.948
ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT STRIPPING

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:37.983
AWAY STATUTORY PROTECTIONS SUCH

02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:39.018

ASSEMBLY THE FLOOR JACKIE SAID

02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:46.725
THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL. I

02:07:46.792 --> 02:07:49.261
WOULD SAY- IT'S A BAD BILL AND

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:50.596
THAT WHEN WE MAKE IT EVEN MORE

02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:52.097
DIFFICULT TO BECOME POLICE

02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:54.400

CAREER INTO THE HANDS OF A

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:06.011
BIASED UNACCOUNTABLE BOARD-

02:08:06.078 --> 02:08:07.479
THIS UNACCOUNTABLE BOARD IS NOT

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:08.547
ON THE STREET AT NIGHT WHEN

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:10.049
OFFICERS HAVE TO MAKE A SPLIT

02:08:10.115 --> 02:08:12.384
SECOND DECISION IT'S ALL EASY

02:08:12.451 --> 02:08:13.452
FOR US TO YOU MONDAY MORNING

02:08:13.519 --> 02:08:15.287
ACCORDING QUARTERBACKING AND

THAT HAVE HAPPENED- THAT POLICE

02:08:18.590 --> 02:08:19.892
OFFICERS MADE A SPLIT DOES

02:08:19.958 --> 02:08:22.294
SECOND DECISION ON NOT KNOWING

02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:23.162
WHAT THEY KNEW THE FOLLOWING

02:08:23.228 --> 02:08:25.064

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:30.035
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST OFFICERS

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:31.370
BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT RUNNING

02:08:31.437 --> 02:08:32.671
DOWN AN ALLEY CHASING SOMEBODY

02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:33.739
THAT HAS SOMETHING IN THEIR

IT'S WHATEVER IT IS WHATEVER

02:08:38.844 --> 02:08:40.846
THE STORY ENDS UP BEING AT THAT

02:08:40.913 --> 02:08:42.047
VERY MOMENT POLICE OFFICERS

02:08:42.114 --> 02:08:43.415
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S SUCH A

02:08:43.482 --> 02:08:47.052
BROAD DEFINITION IN THIS BILL.

02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:47.719

HUMAN WITH RIGHTS. AND HE WAS A

02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:03.869
BAD POLICE OFFICER. BUT THE

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:05.804
JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS. ERIC

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:07.339
CHAUVIN IS NOW SERVING OVER

02:09:07.406 --> 02:09:09.041
TWENTY TWO YEARS IN PRISON. SO

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:10.075
THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN

02:09:10.142 --> 02:09:11.810

COM LONGER.

02:11:10.696 --> 02:11:11.730
MADAM CHAIR I TO

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:15.367
RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO- YOU

02:11:15.434 --> 02:11:17.369
KNOW THIS BILL HAS. GONE

02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:20.739
THROUGH- A METAMORPHOSIS QUITE

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:23.775
FRANKLY- SINCE IT LEFT THIS

02:11:23.842 --> 02:11:26.211
FLOOR- AND TRAVELED ON TO THE

02:11:26.278 --> 02:11:30.649

02:11:30.716 --> 02:11:34.786
IT IT. ARE THERE ARE SO MANY OF

02:11:34.853 --> 02:11:37.990
THE CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS ON

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:40.559
THAT THE AUTHOR HEARD- FROM SO

02:11:40.626 --> 02:11:42.794
MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES ON THIS

02:11:42.861 --> 02:11:45.430
BILL. AND I THINK AT THE END OF

02:11:45.497 --> 02:11:47.866
THE DAY IT IS IMPORTANT TO

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:50.836
REMEMBER A FEW THINGS. THAT THE

02:11:50.902 --> 02:11:54.106
ADVISORY COMMITTEE DOES NOT

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:57.676
HAVE THE FINAL SAY. THE

02:11:57.743 --> 02:11:58.844
ADVISORY COMMITTEE MAKES

02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:01.513
RECOMMENDATIONS FOLKS SHOULD

02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:03.915
NOT BE AFRAID OF AN ADVISORY

02:12:03.982 --> 02:12:06.852
COMMITTEE. IF YOU WANT TO BE

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:09.187
COMPLETELY HONEST YOU KNOW THAT

02:12:09.254 --> 02:12:11.690
OFTEN TIMES FOLKS DON'T ALWAYS

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:13.425
TAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF AN

02:12:13.492 --> 02:12:16.895
ADVISORY COUNCIL. BUT THEY LIKE

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:19.364
TO HAVE THAT ENTITY THERE. GIVE

02:12:19.431 --> 02:12:22.301
SOME ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE.

02:12:22.367 --> 02:12:24.903
THIS BILL STILL WILL ALLOW FOR

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:26.838
THE DECERTIFICATION OF BAD

02:12:26.905 --> 02:12:29.207
APPLES AND WHAT WE KNOW FOR

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:33.712
SURE IS THAT BAD APPLES. PUT

02:12:33.779 --> 02:12:36.748
EVERYONE'S LIFE IN DANGER.

02:12:36.815 --> 02:12:39.084
INCLUDING THE LIVES OF THEIR

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:42.521
PARTNERS AND THEIR COLLEAGUES.

02:12:42.587 --> 02:12:44.022
AND THEIR FELLOW OFFICERS ON

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:46.658
THE FORCE AND THE LAST THING I

02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:51.296
JUST WANT TO REMIND US IS THAT.

02:12:51.363 --> 02:12:53.965
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER HOW

02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:56.001
YOU LABEL YOURSELF IF YOU'RE AN

02:12:56.068 --> 02:12:57.969
ACTIVIST IF YOU'RE AN ACADEMIC

02:12:58.036 --> 02:13:00.272
IF YOU'RE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IF

02:13:00.339 --> 02:13:04.009
YOUR PRACTITIONER. YOU CAN COME

02:13:04.076 --> 02:13:04.609
TO THE TABLE WITH ALL OF THOSE

02:13:04.676 --> 02:13:09.281
LABELS. WHAT'S AT STAKE IS WHAT

02:13:09.348 --> 02:13:11.483
HAPPENS WHEN. ALL OF THOSE

02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:16.188
FOLKS COME AND LISTEN TO CASES.

02:13:16.254 --> 02:13:20.792
AND DIG INTO THE INVESTIGATION.

02:13:20.859 --> 02:13:22.394
AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE NOT

02:13:22.461 --> 02:13:25.464
STILL CONTINUING TO BE AFRAID

02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:27.632
OF THOSE LABELS AND SUGGEST

02:13:27.699 --> 02:13:29.634
THAT IF YOU'RE AN ACTIVIST YOU

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:31.770
CAN'T BE PRO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT

02:13:31.837 --> 02:13:33.905
IF YOU'RE A PRACTITIONER YOU

02:13:33.972 --> 02:13:35.107
CAN'T BE AGAINST LAW

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:37.409
ENFORCEMENT THAT IF YOU'RE A

02:13:37.476 --> 02:13:38.944
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER YOU

02:13:39.010 --> 02:13:41.747
CAN'T BE AGAINST. CITIZENS WHO

02:13:41.813 --> 02:13:43.949
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT POLICE

02:13:44.015 --> 02:13:46.518
MISCONDUCT. WE SHOULDN'T LET

02:13:46.585 --> 02:13:50.722
LABELS MOTIVATE OUR FEARS ABOUT

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:53.258
WHAT WE ARE HOPING THIS

02:13:53.325 --> 02:13:55.160
ADVISORY COMMITTEE CAN ADD.

02:13:55.227 --> 02:13:57.529
WHICH AT THE END OF THE DAY ARE

02:13:57.596 --> 02:13:59.498
JUST DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.

02:13:59.564 --> 02:14:01.466

WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES.

02:14:11.042 --> 02:14:12.544
WHY WOULD WE THINK THAT THAT

02:14:12.611 --> 02:14:14.279
WOULDN'T HAPPEN IN THIS CASE

02:14:14.346 --> 02:14:17.749

THANK YOU- I NEED TO HAVE A

04:29:50.807 --> 04:29:52.075
COUPLE OF CONCERNS AND HAVE A

04:29:52.142 --> 04:29:53.510

QUESTIONS. S. H. THANK YOU VERY

MUCH SO- A COUPLE THINGS IN THE

04:30:03.387 --> 04:30:06.890
BILL ONE. IT TALKS ABOUT THOSE

04:30:06.957 --> 04:30:08.258
BEING ELIGIBLE AS BEING

04:30:08.325 --> 04:30:09.793
SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGE AND I

04:30:09.860 --> 04:30:11.562
WONDER IF YOU COULD PROVIDE A

04:30:11.628 --> 04:30:13.397
DEFINITION OF WHAT SOCIALLY

04:30:13.463 --> 04:30:14.665
DISADVANTAGED MEANS FOR THE

04:30:14.731 --> 04:30:17.701
PURPOSES OF THIS BILL. SO

04:30:17.768 --> 04:30:20.904
SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED. CAN

04:30:20.971 --> 04:30:25.742
MEAN- FARMERS OF COLOR IT CAN

04:30:25.809 --> 04:30:28.211
MEAN FARMERS WHO- ARE

04:30:28.278 --> 04:30:31.281
CONSIDERED LOW INCOME- THOSE

04:30:31.348 --> 04:30:32.883
ARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES I'M

04:30:32.950 --> 04:30:34.017
SURE YOU MIGHT HAVE OTHER

04:30:34.084 --> 04:30:35.319
CONCERNS AND I WANT TO MAKE

04:30:35.385 --> 04:30:37.354
SURE THAT I CAN ELABORATE ON

04:30:37.421 --> 04:30:40.157
THAT ANSWER. WHILE YOU ASK

04:30:40.223 --> 04:30:45.662
ANOTHER QUESTION. I HAVE- JUST

04:30:45.729 --> 04:30:47.397
TWO QUESTIONS BUT THE YOU KNOW

04:30:47.464 --> 04:30:48.999
THE ONE THAT THAT HAS

04:30:49.066 --> 04:30:51.568
CONFOUNDED ME A BIT IT IS THE

04:30:51.635 --> 04:30:54.137
DEFINITION OF SOCIALLY

04:30:54.204 --> 04:30:56.873
DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE FROM- THE

04:30:56.940 --> 04:30:58.175
ANALYSIS THAT I HAVE READ AND

04:30:58.241 --> 04:30:59.443
SO THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THE

04:30:59.509 --> 04:31:00.911
QUESTION PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPAND

04:31:00.978 --> 04:31:02.012
ON IT PERHAPS I'M WRONG BUT

04:31:02.079 --> 04:31:03.080
FROM THE ANALYSIS THAT I'VE

04:31:03.146 --> 04:31:05.148
READ. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH

04:31:05.215 --> 04:31:07.684
SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED- RELATES

04:31:07.751 --> 04:31:13.657
TO- AN ETHNIC SORT OF BAD A

04:31:13.724 --> 04:31:15.559
BENCHMARK IN OTHER WORDS IT'S

04:31:15.626 --> 04:31:17.361
PARTICULARLY RELATED TO RACE

04:31:17.427 --> 04:31:19.696
AND I'M JUST CURIOUS- IS THERE

04:31:19.763 --> 04:31:21.832
ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD PUT

04:31:21.898 --> 04:31:24.401
SOMEONE IN THE CATEGORY- FOR

04:31:24.468 --> 04:31:25.936
SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED WITH

04:31:26.003 --> 04:31:28.138
RESPECT TO THESE FARMERS. YES

04:31:28.205 --> 04:31:30.340
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO

04:31:30.407 --> 04:31:33.143
IN THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF THE

04:31:33.210 --> 04:31:36.480
BILL IT DOES NOT SPECIFY THAT

04:31:36.546 --> 04:31:38.749
RACE WOULD BE A DETERMINING

04:31:38.815 --> 04:31:40.884
FACTOR. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW

04:31:40.951 --> 04:31:42.219
IF THAT WOULD BE ALLOWABLE

04:31:42.285 --> 04:31:44.287
UNDER THE LAW BUT SOCIALLY

04:31:44.354 --> 04:31:46.623
DISADVANTAGED CAN ALSO MEAN IF

04:31:46.690 --> 04:31:48.592
YOU ARE A VETERAN IF YOU ARE

04:31:48.659 --> 04:31:51.328
DISABLED. IF YOU HAVE LIMITED

04:31:51.395 --> 04:31:54.765
RESOURCES. WITH WHICH TO-

04:31:54.831 --> 04:31:56.433
CONTINUE TO PRODUCE ON YOUR

04:31:56.500 --> 04:31:58.101
FARM SO THOSE ARE OTHER

04:31:58.168 --> 04:32:02.072
EXAMPLES THAT ALSO- HELP TO

04:32:02.139 --> 04:32:03.440
HOPEFULLY DEFINE WHAT SOCIALLY

04:32:03.507 --> 04:32:06.076
DISADVANTAGED. MEANS I KNOW

04:32:06.143 --> 04:32:07.678
THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR

04:32:07.744 --> 04:32:09.980
RESIDENT FARMER ON THE SENATE

04:32:10.047 --> 04:32:11.314
FLOOR WHO TALKS ABOUT HOW

04:32:11.381 --> 04:32:13.083
EXPENSIVE IT IS TO MAINTAIN

04:32:13.150 --> 04:32:15.118
YOUR FARMLAND AND THOSE THAT

04:32:15.185 --> 04:32:16.620
ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:32:16.687 --> 04:32:17.654
THAT HAPPENS WITH LIMITED

04:32:17.721 --> 04:32:20.924
RESOURCES. THAT'S YOU SENATOR.

04:32:20.991 --> 04:32:25.729
FROM A CLOUD- ARE ALSO INCLUDED

04:32:25.796 --> 04:32:28.832
IN THIS DEFINITION. RACE IS

04:32:28.899 --> 04:32:32.803
NOT- IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE

04:32:32.869 --> 04:32:35.539
BILL. OKAY SO THEN THERE IS- I

04:32:35.605 --> 04:32:36.540
WILL GO BACK AND LOOK AT IT

04:32:36.606 --> 04:32:38.175
THERE IS A DEFINITION PROVIDED

04:32:38.241 --> 04:32:40.811
WITHIN THE BILL AS TO WHAT

04:32:40.877 --> 04:32:41.578
SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGES IS THAT

04:32:41.645 --> 04:32:46.216
CORRECT. IT IS- ACTUALLY ON

04:32:46.283 --> 04:32:49.052
PAGE FIVE OF THE BILL AND IT IS

04:32:49.119 --> 04:32:52.189
ONE OF THE- LISTED CRITERIA.

04:32:52.255 --> 04:32:54.124
AND THEY DO GIVE EXAMPLES OKAY

04:32:54.191 --> 04:32:56.359
THANK YOU AND THEN- I FOR MY

04:32:56.426 --> 04:32:58.261
FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE IF

04:32:58.328 --> 04:33:02.265
THERE IS ANY CONCERN- GIVEN

04:33:02.332 --> 04:33:04.701
THAT WE ARE ON A FEDERAL LEVEL

04:33:04.768 --> 04:33:06.503
YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME-

04:33:06.570 --> 04:33:09.840
ISSUE AND SOME. LITIGATION

04:33:09.906 --> 04:33:13.877

DISADVANTAGED- FARMERS WITH

04:33:17.080 --> 04:33:19.082
RESPECT TO COVERT RELIEF AND I

04:33:19.149 --> 04:33:20.383
BELIEVE THAT WAS CHALLENGED IN

04:33:20.450 --> 04:33:22.719
COURT AS BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL

04:33:22.786 --> 04:33:25.489
BECAUSE IT WASN'T OFFERED TO-

04:33:25.555 --> 04:33:26.723
EVERYONE IN THE FARMING

04:33:26.790 --> 04:33:28.391
COMMUNITY JUSTIN CURIOUS IF

04:33:28.458 --> 04:33:29.993
THERE'S CONCERNS WITH THE SPELL

04:33:30.060 --> 04:33:32.095
THAT THAT. MIGHT FALL INTO THE

04:33:32.162 --> 04:33:33.930
SAME CATEGORY. I DON'T THINK

04:33:33.997 --> 04:33:35.432
THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE

04:33:35.499 --> 04:33:36.800

FINANCIALLY SELF SUFFICIENT AND

04:33:49.880 --> 04:33:51.581
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

04:33:51.648 --> 04:33:52.749

GOOD HOUSING LEGISLATION- BUT

04:40:44.694 --> 04:40:46.763
THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS- AN

04:40:46.829 --> 04:40:48.298
IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS

04:40:59.075 --> 04:41:00.143
IMPORTANT PROCESS EVEN THOUGH

04:41:00.210 --> 04:41:02.812
IT CAN BE PAINFUL- POLITICALLY

04:41:02.879 --> 04:41:05.048
BUT IT FORCES THAT KIND OF

04:41:05.114 --> 04:41:06.649
DISCIPLINE TO GO THROUGH THAT

04:41:06.716 --> 04:41:08.218

CHAIR DO YOU THINK THAT THIS

05:29:42.863 --> 05:29:45.465
CHARGING AND CURRENT DEBT WOULD

05:29:45.532 --> 05:29:48.001

THE FUTURE. HI IF YES THROUGH

05:29:51.638 --> 05:29:53.206
THE CHAIR I DO BELIEVE IT WOULD

05:29:53.273 --> 05:29:54.474
CREATE A BUTTERFLY EFFECT IN

05:29:54.541 --> 05:29:56.977
THE SENSE THAT BYE BYE HOPING

05:29:57.043 --> 05:29:59.146
STUDENTS OUT WITH THEIR DAD. IT

BUSINESS TO BUY A HOME TO GET

05:30:04.284 --> 05:30:06.786
THEIR LIVES ON MOVING. THE FACT

05:30:06.853 --> 05:30:07.921
THE MATTER IS ONE OF THE BIG

05:30:07.988 --> 05:30:09.356
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SO MANY OF

05:30:09.422 --> 05:30:11.391
US AND THE NEXT GENERATION IS

05:30:11.458 --> 05:30:12.926
THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT

05:30:12.993 --> 05:30:14.327
THE NEXT GENERATION IS STARTING

05:30:14.394 --> 05:30:15.395
TO ACCRUE JUST TO BE ABLE TO

05:30:15.462 --> 05:30:16.463
AFFORD TO HAVE A HIGHER

05:30:16.530 --> 05:30:18.965
EDUCATION IS SO MUCH HIGHER.

05:30:19.032 --> 05:30:20.934
THAN IT EVER WAS BEFORE AND IN

05:30:21.001 --> 05:30:22.202
THE END OF THE DAY THAT IS

05:30:22.269 --> 05:30:23.603
WHAT'S MAKING IT SO DIFFICULT

05:30:23.670 --> 05:30:24.638
FOR PEOPLE TO REALLY START

05:30:24.704 --> 05:30:26.706
THEIR LIVES AND PROVIDE THE

05:30:26.773 --> 05:30:28.775
KIND OF ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO OUR

05:30:28.842 --> 05:30:30.777
ECONOMY INTO OUR SOCIETY THAT

05:30:30.844 --> 05:30:32.913
WE- THAT WE THAT WE WANT THEM

05:30:32.979 --> 05:30:34.314
TO PROVIDE WHEN WE WHEN WE WENT

05:30:34.381 --> 05:30:35.482
WHEN WE SENT THEM TO COLLEGE IN

05:30:35.549 --> 05:30:36.516
THE FIRST PLACE JUST TO GIVE

05:30:36.583 --> 05:30:37.918
YOU A SENSE IN NINETEEN NINETY

05:30:37.984 --> 05:30:39.219
THREE THE AVERAGE GRAD HAD

05:30:39.286 --> 05:30:40.654
NINETY THREE THOUSAND. THREE

05:30:40.720 --> 05:30:41.988
HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF DEBT

05:30:42.055 --> 05:30:44.090
NOW IT'S OVER THIRTY THOUSAND

05:30:44.157 --> 05:30:45.458
DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH THE

05:30:45.525 --> 05:30:47.494
SALARIES HAVE ONLY GONE UP. A

05:30:47.561 --> 05:30:49.362
LITTLE BIT SINCE THEN I'M SO

05:30:49.429 --> 05:30:50.463
THAT WOULD BE THE BUTTERFLY

05:30:50.530 --> 05:30:52.399
EFFECT RIGHT THE FACT THAT THIS

05:30:52.465 --> 05:30:55.001
THIS- THIS THIS IMPACT- BY BY

05:30:55.068 --> 05:30:56.770
BY BY GIVING MORE FLEXIBILITY

05:30:56.836 --> 05:30:58.205
TO THESE YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO'VE

05:30:58.271 --> 05:31:00.006
ACCRUED SO MUCH THAT. IT WILL

05:31:00.073 --> 05:31:01.975
OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM

05:31:02.042 --> 05:31:03.210
TO REINVEST IN GAYS IN OUR

05:31:03.276 --> 05:31:04.978
ECONOMY BUILD LIVES BUILD

05:31:05.045 --> 05:31:09.649

YOU FOR YOUR SPONSOR. THE

05:31:14.487 --> 05:31:16.489
BUTTERFLY EFFECT IS A SMALL

05:31:16.556 --> 05:31:18.258
CHANGE NOW WHICH READ RESULTS

05:31:18.325 --> 05:31:19.893
IN A DRASTIC CHANGE IN THE

05:31:19.960 --> 05:31:21.861
FUTURE. AND I THINK THAT THIS

05:31:21.928 --> 05:31:23.363
SMALL CHANGE NOW TO DISCHARGE

05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:25.599
COLLEGE DEBT- IS GOING TO

05:31:25.665 --> 05:31:26.933
DRASTICALLY HURT US IN THE

05:31:27.000 --> 05:31:28.034
FUTURE FINANCIALLY IN THE

05:31:28.101 --> 05:31:29.469
REASON WHY IS BECAUSE- THE SAME

05:31:29.536 --> 05:31:30.704
THING THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM

05:31:30.770 --> 05:31:32.472
LAKE ELSINORE SAID. THAT YOU

05:31:32.539 --> 05:31:33.807
KNOW THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

05:31:33.873 --> 05:31:35.775
GRADUATE WITH THE TURN FIFTY

05:31:35.842 --> 05:31:37.444
THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBT- I KNOW

05:31:37.510 --> 05:31:39.279
SOMEBODY WHO IS- WORKING ON A

05:31:39.346 --> 05:31:41.081
DOUBLE LOT AGREE THAT. A LOT A

05:31:41.147 --> 05:31:42.315
BACHELOR'S DEGREE IS SOMETHING

05:31:42.382 --> 05:31:43.817
ELSE AND- SHE ACTUALLY HAS A

05:31:43.883 --> 05:31:45.619
JOB WITH SPACEX AND MAKES A

05:31:45.685 --> 05:31:47.220
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO

05:31:47.287 --> 05:31:48.622
DISCHARGE THAT DEBT. WOULD JUST

05:31:48.688 --> 05:31:51.191
BE- NOT RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE

05:31:51.258 --> 05:31:52.492
TO PAY FOR SOMETHING IN ORDER

05:31:52.559 --> 05:31:55.262
TO BE- INVESTED. AND SO I JUST

05:31:55.328 --> 05:31:56.863
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE

05:31:56.930 --> 05:32:00.133
