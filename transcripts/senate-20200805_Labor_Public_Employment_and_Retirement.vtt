CELL THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

AS MENTIONED BY THE AUTHOR THIS

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:49.328
IS AN INCREDIBLY HUGE PROBLEM

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.430
THAT WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE SINCE

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:52.999
THE START OF THIS PANDEMIC AND-

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.134
ENDEMIC HAS PROGRESSIVELY

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:55.735
BECOMING MORE AND MORE OBVIOUS

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.236
THAT. THIS IS ONE OF THE

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:58.337
REASONS WHY WE'RE SEEING

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:00.940
OUTBREAKS IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:02.208
WORKERS ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.110
RELY ON THE RUMOR MILL TO KNOW

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:08.514
IF THERE. IS AN OUTBREAK

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.081
STARTING AT THEIR WORK. AND

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:10.016
WHAT THAT SAYS DONE IS. A LOT

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:12.718
OF THEM A LOT OF THEM WITH.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:13.853
WOULD COMPROMISE. IMMUNITY

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.088
ISSUES AND OTHER CONCERNS TO

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:17.556
JUST GO TO WORK AND HOPE THAT

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:18.791
NOTHING BAD IS HAPPENING AND

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:20.626
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW. AND ALL

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.061
THIS BILL REALLY DOES IS MAKE

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.896
SURE THAT EMPLOYERS WHEN THEY

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:25.765
ARE NOTIFIED. PUBLICATION OF

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.566
THE NINETEEN- EXPOSURE TO COVER

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:29.135
NINETEEN THAT THEY- NOTIFY THE

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.603
WORKERS THEY NOTIFY THE UNION

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.337
IN THE APPROPRIATE STATE

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.272
AGENCIES SO THAT. PEOPLE COULD

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:35.174
ACTIONS CAN BE TAKEN. AND

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.008
THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.977
EACH CASE FOR WORKERS. THEY CAN

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:39.779
DO WITH THAT INFORMATION WHAT

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.180
THEY WELL THE STATE AGENCIES

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.515
WILL HOPEFULLY USE THAT TO.

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:44.016
PRIORITIZE RESOURCES TO MAKE

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.018
SURE THAT. WHERE CASES ARE

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.119
REALLY GETTING OUT OF CONTROL

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.988
THAT THEY PAY CLOSER ATTENTION.

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.323
AND ALSO JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:51.590
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:54.327
OPPONENTS CONCERNS. AND ONES

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:55.461

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.529
FOCUS ON WHAT. AMENDMENT THAT

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:58.464
MAY BE COMING SOON TO THE BILL.

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.566
BUT THE BIGGEST ONE IS LIKELY

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:01.701
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.669
MORE CLEAR FOR EMPLOYERS SO

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:09.041
THAT. WE WANT. TO MAKE SURE

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.109
THAT THIS.BUT DON'T SURE THAT

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.610
WHEN WORKERS NOT WHEN WORKERS

AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE WANT

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:21.087
TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO EMPLOYERS

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:23.289
THAT THIS ONLY APPLIES WHEN.

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:24.623
WHEN THERE HAS BEEN THAT CLEAR

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.025
NOTIFICATION THERE ARE ALSO A

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.626
VARIETY OF OTHER AMENDMENTS

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:29.028
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE OF

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.830
WHICH IS THAT. THE EXPOSURE

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.398
MUST HAVE OCCURRED AT THE WORK

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.500
SITE- THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:35.801
EMPLOYERS TO DISCLOSE ANY

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.579
A PR IN REQUESTING CAN'T BE

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:48.014
SHARED WITH OUTSIDE AGENCIES

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.948

NOTIFICATION. ONLY ONCE THE

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:56.840
EMPLOYER BECAUSE THIS I THINK

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:13.057
OF THOSE CHANGE IS THE WILL BE.

00:43:13.123 --> 00:43:17.561

THE SOME OF THE EMPLOYERS IT'S

00:43:19.663 --> 00:43:21.098

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.840
DIFFICULT BUT I DO APPRECIATE

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:31.608

OF WHETHER WE HAVE GOOD ACTORS

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:46.991

SEROLOGY TESTS WHICH COULD BE

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:55.112
USED SOMETIMES. OF COULD DETECT

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:56.480

AN OLD INFECTION THE PERSON HAS

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:00.617

THAT BECAUSE OF. SITUATIONS

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:23.373

INSTEAD OF PERHAPS GETTING LOTS

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:54.571

THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

PROGRAM HAS BEEN CRITICAL

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:24.347
LIFELINE FOR WORKING FAMILIES

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:25.748
ACROSS THE STATE EXPERIENCING

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:28.651
SEVERE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP DURING

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:29.919
POPE AT NINETEEN. PANDEMIC SO

THE PROBLEMS WITH EDT RECENTLY

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.226
AND I THINK OUR CONSTITUENTS-

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.762
HAVE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR. WHAT

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.364
THESE DELAYS HAVE DONE TO THEM

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:43.299
BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IS THE

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:45.735
BEHIND THE SCENES ISSUES THAT

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:47.470
SOMETIMES BECAUSE THOSE DELAYS

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:50.439
AND YES- EDT DOES HAVE YOU KNOW

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:52.541
A PROCESS AND ARE TRYING TO GET

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:54.243
THROUGH A LOT OF BACKLOG. BUT

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.644
IT'S MADE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:58.080
WHEN WE HAVE COMPANIES WHO

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.882
WON'T RESPOND TO THE REQUEST.

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:02.485
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS TWO FOLD

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:05.388
ONE. IT TAKES A LOT OF WHAT IS

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:08.391
ALREADY EXISTING- NPD'S

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:11.861
PAPERWORK INTHEIR ABILITY- TO

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.562
pPURSUE THINGS AND CODIFIES IT

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:16.499
BASICALLY IT TAKES THINGS THAT

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:18.067
YOU FIND ON FORMS REQUIRED THAT

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:20.202
THE BUSINESSES RESEARCH INTO A-

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:21.470
TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT FOR TEN

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:24.373
DAYS AND KIND OF. A LAW THAT

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:27.410
WAY THE WORKER ISN'T LEFT ON

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:31.914
THE HOOK WHEN THE EMPLOYEE.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:34.984
DOES RESEARCH. WE IS. I KNOW OF

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.252
SITUATION IN SOMEONE HERE ABOUT

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.354
WHERE BURKE. HAVE WAITING FOR.

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:39.655
A REASON TIME WHICH HAS BEEN

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:40.890
THREE MONTHS BECAUSE AN

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:43.759
EMPLOYER REFUSES TO HAND OVER

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:45.995
WAGE INFORMATION ON THAT WORKER

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:48.063
SO THIS JUST STRENGTHENS EDIE'S

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.365
POSITION AND REQUIRING

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:52.334
EMPLOYERS TO DO THAT WE ARE

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:52.902
TAKING SOME AMENDMENTS THAT

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.837
WOULD BE REALLY CLEAR WE TOOK

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.672
SERIOUSLY- THE CHAMBERS

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.774
OPPOSITION BECAUSE- WE FELT

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.643
LIKE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:01.644
DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMPLOYERS

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.345
HERE WE'RE WE'RE NOT REALLY

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.680
TALKING ABOUT THE EMPLOYERS FOR

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.982
REGISTERING THEIR EMPLOYEES AB

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:08.884
ET DE INTER FOLLOWING BASICALLY

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:11.253
THE LAWS AND MIGHT MISS A FORM

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.521
AND TIME. UNDER THOSE

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:15.524
CIRCUMSTANCES WE'RE TAKING.

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:17.493
AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT THE

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.161
EMPLOYERS CAN RECEIVE AN

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:21.597
EXTENSION FOR GOOD REASON IF

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:22.898
THEY MISS THE TEN DAY-

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:24.400
VERIFICATION LETTER OR THEY

THEY COULDN'T GET TO THE MAIL

01:08:28.003 --> 01:08:28.704
OR SOMETHING. LIKE THAT

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:31.674
HAPPENED- WERE ALSO CLEAR FIND

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:35.277
THE GOOD BECAUSE EXTENSION.

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:36.912
STILL FLIES IT IT APPLIES AND

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.647
THEY CAN APPEAL THAT SO THE

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:40.716
PEEL PROCESS IS STILL IN THERE

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:41.250
STILL A THIRTY DAY APPEAL

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.152
PROCESS. WE ARE GOING TO

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:44.787
COMPLETELY TAKE OUT OF THE

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.355
BILL- IF THEY SHOULD MOVE

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:50.292
FORWARD THE PORTION ABOUT IF

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:50.860
THIS HAPPENS MORE THAN FIVE

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:51.527
EMPLOYEES WHAT WE WERE TRYING

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:53.162
TO DO IS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.030
SOME EMPLOYERS AGREE JUSTLY

01:08:55.097 --> 01:08:55.865
DOING THIS FOR EVERY SINGLE

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:58.367
EMPLOYEE. PRIMARILY OVER LEFT

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:00.035
THEY'RE JUST NOT RESPONDING AND

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:01.737
WE WERE TRYING TO STREAMLINE IT

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.038
FOR THE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE

01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:04.173
DESPERATELY WAITING ON THAT

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.942
CHECK. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.677
BUT CONFUSING AND WE ACTUALLY

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:09.879
AGREE WITH THE CHAMBER AND IT'S

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.013
BEST TO JUST TAKE THAT PIECE

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.315
OUT. SO EVERY SINGLE CLAIM IT

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:15.150

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:17.686
PROCESS BY WHICH THE EMPLOYER

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:19.588
WHAT WOULD HAVE TO RESPOND.

01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:22.224
WHAT WHAT THIS SAYS IS WHEN THE

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.425
EMPLOYER RESPONDS. WHAT DOES

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:26.962
NOT RESPOND THAT ALLOWS THE EDG

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:30.299
WORKER. TO ASSUME WHAT THE

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:32.768
WORKERS TELLING THEM THAT THE

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:35.137

THAT THEY GAVE IS ACCURATE AS

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:40.476
FAR AS WHAT THEIR WAGE WISE SO

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:41.443
THAT THEY CAN GET UP TO THE

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.946
MAXIMUM BENEFIT WHAT WE'VE SEEN

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.315
IS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO EDT

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:47.650
WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:48.884

EMPLOYEES. THERE AND THEY ARE-

01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:53.722
THEY DESERVE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:55.424
INSURANCE BUT THEY'RE GETTING

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:57.693
CLAIMS OF ZERO DOLLARS BECAUSE

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.728
THEY CANNOT GET INFORMATION

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:01.897
FROM THE COMPANIES SO THIS JUST

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.599
SAYS IT COMPANIES IF YOU DON'T

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:07.636

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.305
ARTICLES FORWARD AND WE HAD WE

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:10.706
ASSUME THROUGH THE WORK WITH

THE EMPLOYEE WHAT THEIR WAGES

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:15.744
ARE SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:18.213
GET A CHECK. NOW THIS. ACTUALLY

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:21.216
EXISTING LAW. I MEAN EDT HAVE

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:23.452
THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THIS IT

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:24.954
IT EXISTS IN THEIR PRACTICE BUT

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.822
WE'RE GONNA CODIFY INTO LAW.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:29.158
THE OTHER HALF OF THE BILL IS

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:32.094
SIMPLY TO ALLOW. BIT EDT AND

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:34.029

HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES WHO

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:42.237
DID NOT PAY INTO UNEMPLOYMENT

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.305
INSURANCE. WHAT WE KNOW IS WE

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:45.307
HAVE HAD TO TAKE OUT A LOAN

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.042
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.911
BECAUSE OUR FUND IS BROKEN. AND

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.679
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.581
WE HAVE TO PAY BACK THAT FUND

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.116
BUT THAT'S NOT PUT ON SMALL

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:55.618
BUSINESSES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:57.620
BEEN ABIDING BY THE LAW PEEN

01:10:57.686 --> 01:10:59.555

ALL THOSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN

EMPLOYER OF RECORD. THAT SHOULD

01:48:29.603 --> 01:48:31.104
ACTUALLY WILL HELP A LOT OF

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:32.606
PEOPLE WHO HAD QUESTIONS UNDER

01:48:32.672 --> 01:48:36.877

BROKER IN A TRUE REFERRAL

01:48:43.683 --> 01:48:45.719
AGENCY AND WE REALLY STRUGGLED

01:48:45.785 --> 01:48:48.221
WITH IT BECAUSE IT WASN'T

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:49.289
ALWAYS CLEAR WHEN PEOPLE ARE

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:52.025
ACTING AS A LABOR WORKER IN

01:48:52.092 --> 01:48:54.394
CALLING THEM BASICALLY REFERRAL

01:48:54.461 --> 01:48:56.863
AGENCY AND WE THOUGHT IF WE

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:59.432
CRAP UNTIL OF DIFFERENT ASK

01:48:59.499 --> 01:49:03.970
ITSELF LAST YEAR WE ARE TRYING

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:05.572
TO. PAYS EIGHTY WORKERS GEN

01:49:05.639 --> 01:49:09.209
WHAT YES. EVERYBODY FOR ALL

01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:10.644
AGES ANDERSON CIRCUMSTANCES IF

YOU'RE A REFERRAL SO AND X.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.548
THAT SO THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:18.451
OF A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:20.020
PEOPLE HAD ABOUT A THIRD OF

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:22.856
INTERPRETERS AS- THE IT. IN THE

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:24.925
WORK IS TRUE. A TO SAY YES NO

01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:26.192
TO A- THAT THEY'RE WORKING

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:27.694
UNDER THEIR OWN CONDITIONS ARE

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:30.330
WORKING AS THEMSELVES- AND

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.532
REALLY THAT THE REFERRAL AGENCY

01:49:32.599 --> 01:49:33.733
OR THE COMPANY IF YOU WILL IS

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.069
JUST DOING THE PROCEDURAL STUFF

01:49:36.136 --> 01:49:38.905
YOU KNOW CALLING THEM UP DO YOU

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:39.439
WANT THIS JOB OKAY. WE'RE

01:49:39.506 --> 01:49:42.809
PROCESSING THE PAYMENT WE DON'T

01:49:42.876 --> 01:49:43.576
CHARGE. MANY CLIENTS FOR THAT

01:49:43.643 --> 01:49:45.412
SERVICE SO THAT'S WHERE THE

01:49:45.478 --> 01:49:48.181
MONEY FLOWS AND- THAT THE

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:50.317
INDIVIDUAL CAN SAY YES THEY CAN

01:49:50.383 --> 01:49:51.785
SAY NO THEY GO OUT ON THEIR OWN

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:54.054
THEY DO IT. IT REQUIRES THAT

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.388
INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE A BUSINESS

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.590
LICENSE- THAT WAS A WHILE

01:49:57.657 --> 01:49:59.459
BEFORE I MEAN THIS IS NOTHING

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:01.861
NEW. AS I DO THE ANALYSIS WAS

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.596
WAS RIGHT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:50:03.663 --> 01:50:04.965
FIGURE OUT BECAUSE WE MADE IT

01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:06.333
ALMOST SEEMED LIKE OPTIONAL

01:50:06.399 --> 01:50:07.367
WHETHER THERE AND CHECK IT OR

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:09.336
NOT AND- WE WILL FIGURE THAT

01:50:09.402 --> 01:50:11.571
PIECE- CHOIRS THAT. IT'S A

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:13.873
CERTIFICATE CAN NECESSARY TO DO

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:17.711
THAT JOB OR BE ABLE TO DO THAT

01:50:17.777 --> 01:50:18.411
JOB THAT THEY HAVE TO. SO YOU

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:19.446
CAMPUS AN INTERPRETER WHO IS

01:50:19.512 --> 01:50:21.881
NOT SIR IN SPANISH BECAUSE WE

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:23.550
HAS BEEN A CERTIFICATION FOR

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:25.285
INTERPRETERS. HOWEVER IF IT'S

01:50:25.352 --> 01:50:27.887
AN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE- YOU

01:50:27.954 --> 01:50:29.956
KNOW FROM CARRILLO THAT THERE'S

01:50:30.023 --> 01:50:31.891
NO CERTIFICATION AVAILABLE.

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:33.593
THERE THERE'S NO CERTIFICATION

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.794
NEEDED SO THAT'S THE WAY WE

01:50:34.861 --> 01:50:35.729
DEALT WITH IT. THE NOW

01:50:35.795 --> 01:50:37.364
SUGGESTED. I THINK WE FINALLY

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:39.432
GOT IT RIGHT WE'VE BEEN REALLY

01:50:39.499 --> 01:50:41.601
STRUGGLING WITH. INSURING

01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:43.303
INDIVIDUALS WERE NEGOTIATING

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:44.404
FOR THEMSELVES ARE ABLE TO DO

01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:47.007
SO IN THE THIRD. QUALITY THEY

01:50:47.073 --> 01:50:50.643
HAVE THE THAT THEY HAVE A SKILL

01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:54.014
THAT IS DESIRABLE AND SO THEY

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.482
HAVE THE ABILITY TO- BETTER.

01:50:55.548 --> 01:50:58.485
SERVE THEMSELVES SO THIS NEW

01:50:58.551 --> 01:51:01.755
REFERRAL LANGUAGE. GIVES POWER

01:51:01.821 --> 01:51:02.989
TO BE THOSE INDEPENDENT

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:04.457
CONTRACTORS WERE WORKING UNDER

01:51:04.524 --> 01:51:08.762
IT AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT APRIL

01:51:08.828 --> 01:51:09.362
AGENCY FROM JUST BEING A LABOR

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:11.264
BROKER. AND TAKING 50% OF

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:12.899
SOMEBODY'S WAGES AND THE THINGS

01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:13.600
THAT WE'VE KIND OF SEEN

01:51:13.666 --> 01:51:14.934
HISTORICALLY UNFORTUNATELY IN A

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:16.503
LOT OF LOW WAGE WORKERS. IT

01:51:16.569 --> 01:51:19.439
ALSO DOESN'T ALLOW- CERTAIN

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:21.341
CRITTERS TO FALL UNDER THIS AND

01:51:21.408 --> 01:51:23.043
THOSE WERE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:25.512
DETAINED- HELLO SHE HAD THE

01:51:25.578 --> 01:51:27.213
DESIGNATION AS HIGH HAZARD

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.982
INDUSTRIES. BORN IN HAS

01:51:29.049 --> 01:51:30.550
DIFFICULT HIGHER RISK OF INJURY

01:51:30.617 --> 01:51:33.353
ON THE JOB. AND THE REASON WE

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:37.724
DON'T WANT THAT IS WE DON'T.

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:40.627
WANT INDEPENDENT. I READ. I'M

01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:41.795
WITHOUT THAT WORKS AND WE DON'T

01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:42.862
WANT IT TO BE USED AS A TOOL

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:45.098
AVOID WORK COMP AND FOR SECONDS

01:51:45.165 --> 01:51:48.568
AND YOU KNOW IT HIGH RISK. SO

01:51:48.635 --> 01:51:51.671
THAT. I THINK WILL SATISFY-

01:51:51.738 --> 01:51:53.773
LEGITIMATE. INDEPENDENT

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.975
CONTRACTORS IN THESE FIELDS. AT

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:57.944
THAT HAVE WANT TO WORK

01:51:58.011 --> 01:51:58.611
INDEPENDENTLY CAN WORK

01:51:58.678 --> 01:52:00.947
INDEPENDENTLY AND I'M HAVE THE

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:05.251
CERTIFICATIONS TO DO SO WE ALSO

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:08.888
HAVE- SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT WE

01:52:08.955 --> 01:52:13.126
HAVE. CAPTURED ACTIONS WE HAVE

01:52:13.193 --> 01:52:17.430
A- RECORDING ARTISTS MUSICIANS

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:18.131
WE HAVE GREATER CLARITY FOR A

01:52:18.198 --> 01:52:19.466
AND PHOTOGRAPHERS MULTIMEDIA

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:21.334
PROFESSIONALS IN SOME

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:23.036
EXEMPTIONS THAT- WE STARTED

01:52:23.103 --> 01:52:25.472
WORKING OUT RIGHT AFTER AB FIVE

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:28.374
WAS PASSED. WE STILL HAVE WORK

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:31.878
TO DO- AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO

01:52:31.945 --> 01:52:34.514
DO THE NEXT SET WHICH WE WILL

01:52:34.581 --> 01:52:36.282
WORK WITH IF THIS PASSES YOUR

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:39.486
COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL AS IT

01:52:39.552 --> 01:52:40.820
MOVES INTO APPROPRIATIONS. I

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:42.622
MISSED ONE THAT WE AT WE HAVE

01:52:42.689 --> 01:52:45.792
ALSO- JUDGES INDEPENDENT JUDGES

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:48.261
AND NOT JUDGE. JUDGE AND JURY

01:52:48.328 --> 01:52:50.130
JUDGE LIKE GETTING A CATTLE

01:52:50.196 --> 01:52:53.333
SHOW OR A DANCE COMPETITION

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:53.933
THAT THEY'RE NOT EMPLOYEES AND

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.704
WE ARE TRYING TO GET IN. M. M.

01:52:57.770 --> 01:53:00.240
TO REFEREE HE'S AT THAT THEY

01:53:00.306 --> 01:53:01.174
CAN WORK OBVIOUSLY TO REFER

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:03.443
AGENCY AND THEN THERE ARE WAYS-

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:06.146
BUT THE THINGS THAT WE'RE STILL

01:53:06.212 --> 01:53:06.746
WORKING ON. PERFORMING ARTISTS

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:08.114
TO PRESENT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:10.550
WORK. SO THIS IS A BECOME AN

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:12.719
ISSUE WHERE A PERFORMING ARTIST

01:53:12.785 --> 01:53:15.021
OWN THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK AND

01:53:15.088 --> 01:53:16.856
SO THEY'RE NOT. AND I'LL TAKE

01:53:16.923 --> 01:53:19.692
THE EXAMPLE COMEDIAN A COMEDIAN

01:53:19.759 --> 01:53:22.629

CREATED IT THE ONCE. THEY DON'T

01:53:27.433 --> 01:53:27.967
WORK FOR SOMEBODY BECAUSE OF.

01:53:28.034 --> 01:53:29.736
THIRDS OF PROPERTY ISSUE THEN

01:53:29.802 --> 01:53:32.205
FOR THE WORK THAT WE'RE WORKING

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:34.607
IN THAT. THAT SHOULD ALSO WORK

01:53:34.674 --> 01:53:39.179
FOR. CLOWN JUDGE IS IT NOT THE

01:53:39.245 --> 01:53:40.180
CHAIRED CARES DEEPLY SOME F

01:53:40.246 --> 01:53:41.748
THESE WHAT I KNOW THAT THERE IS

01:53:41.814 --> 01:53:45.151
US INTO PERFORMANCES THAT THAT.

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:46.719
THAT IT VIGILS HAFTED THEY'RE

01:53:46.786 --> 01:53:47.921
NOT TAKING DIRECTION FROM

01:53:47.987 --> 01:53:49.822
ANYONE THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS

01:53:49.889 --> 01:53:51.424
SOMEBODY WHO'S OBVIOUSLY ACTING

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:53.293
IN A PLAY OR SOMETHING WHETHER

01:53:53.359 --> 01:53:55.295
BEING DIRECTED. PRECISELY WHAT

01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:57.564
TO DO. THE RELATIONSHIP- WE'RE

01:53:57.630 --> 01:53:58.565
ALSO WORKING ON THE

01:53:58.631 --> 01:53:59.933
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO

INDIVIDUAL SUBCONTRACTORS SO

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:05.271
THIS IS INTERESTING AND TOUGH

01:54:05.338 --> 01:54:05.872
BUT IF THEY'RE TO INDEPENDENT

01:54:05.939 --> 01:54:07.440
CONTRACTORS WHO ARE WORKING

01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:10.210
TOGETHER. IN ONE JOB WHICH YOU

01:54:10.276 --> 01:54:11.177
GET THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:12.879
HAVE ONE CHECK IN SPLIT

01:54:12.946 --> 01:54:15.281
BASICALLY THROUGH THE CONTRACT

01:54:15.348 --> 01:54:18.718
THIS HAPPENS- THE WEDDING

01:54:18.785 --> 01:54:20.486
INDUSTRY A LOT YOU KNOW. THERE

BRING. IT IS VERY LIMITED.

01:54:39.839 --> 01:54:41.241
STEPS WHERE THEY COULD JUST

01:54:41.307 --> 01:54:42.575
SPLIT A CHECK AND EVERYBODY

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:43.810

MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND NO

01:55:06.899 --> 01:55:07.433
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:12.272
ABOUT. AND THERE'S ONE MORE AT

01:55:12.338 --> 01:55:16.209
LEAST- THOSE SHOULD HOPEFULLY

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:18.144
BE COMPLETE BY THE TIME WE GET

LEGITIMACY THAT CAN BE A

03:00:02.758 --> 03:00:05.027
OUTLINED THROUGH THAT I THINK

03:00:05.094 --> 03:00:06.829
IT'S REALLY AN ANSWER TO THE

03:00:06.896 --> 03:00:08.397

SERVICES. IN A GIVEN EXAMPLE IN

03:01:45.427 --> 03:01:46.262
FACT BECAUSE I THINK AT SOME

03:01:46.328 --> 03:01:47.129
POINT THERE'S SO MUCH

03:01:47.196 --> 03:01:48.664
MISINFORMATION OUT THERE RIGHT

03:01:48.731 --> 03:01:51.066

03:02:14.023 --> 03:02:16.025
THAT'S COMPLETELY LEGAL THEY

03:02:16.091 --> 03:02:18.794
NEVER FALL UNDER- THE ABC TESTS

03:02:18.861 --> 03:02:20.129

OBVIOUSLY. I WANT PEOPLE TO

03:02:48.657 --> 03:02:49.825
READ. MANY OF THESE RULES

03:02:49.892 --> 03:02:51.393
EXISTED BEFORE THOSE OF THOSE

03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:52.828
RULES DON'T EXIST BUT THERE ARE

03:02:52.895 --> 03:02:54.563
LEGITIMATE INDEPENDENT

03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:56.632
CONTRACTORS WHO NEVER THIS IS

NOT AN ISSUE FOR. IN MILLION A

03:03:00.302 --> 03:03:01.603
WORK. AND THEN OF COURSE

03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:05.474
THERE'S ALL ACTIONS WE MADE

03:03:05.541 --> 03:03:06.775
ALREADY. THE FIRST ARE ARE

03:03:06.842 --> 03:03:07.643
REALLY BE AFFECTED. AND THEN

03:03:07.710 --> 03:03:09.111
FINALLY YES. HUNDREDS OF

03:03:09.178 --> 03:03:10.212
THOUSANDS OF WORKERS THAT ARE

03:03:10.279 --> 03:03:11.714
BEING AFFECTED I WILL NAME SOME

03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:13.949
OF THEM TO DATE. THERE ARE

03:03:14.016 --> 03:03:15.417
TODAY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER

03:03:17.453 --> 03:03:19.021
THOUSANDS OF UBER AND LIFT

03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:20.723
DRIVERS WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED

ENOUGH MINIMUM WAGE THE- THEN

03:03:23.058 --> 03:03:24.393
ALAMEDA. BECAUSE FIVE THOUSAND

03:03:24.460 --> 03:03:25.894
OF THEM HAD FILED WAIT THE

YEAH OTHER BEING. DEAD BUT

03:03:29.198 --> 03:03:30.966
THAT'S A- GOOD A FACT YOU KNOW

03:03:31.033 --> 03:03:33.001
I THINK. MADE WHOLE FROM THAT

03:03:33.068 --> 03:03:35.637
THE APRS OF LOST INCOME. THAT'S

03:03:35.704 --> 03:03:38.974
POSITIVE AFFECT WE KNOW THAT

03:03:39.041 --> 03:03:40.342
THIS DOES CHANGE THE FIRST. OF

03:03:40.409 --> 03:03:43.479
LIFE IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

03:03:43.545 --> 03:03:46.281
IMPORTANT NO. TRULY THE MINUTE.

03:03:46.348 --> 03:03:52.020
THE. TRACTOR WHERE IS

INDEPENDENT YESTERDAY ARE

03:03:55.724 --> 03:03:57.092
CHANGING BECAUSE NOW THEY DON'T

03:03:57.159 --> 03:03:58.394
HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LENGTHY

03:03:58.460 --> 03:04:00.362
COURT CASE TO FIND OUT THAT

03:04:00.429 --> 03:04:01.296
THEY WERE MISCLASSIFIED IN THE

03:04:01.363 --> 03:04:03.065
LABOR COMMISSIONER CAN DO HER

03:04:03.132 --> 03:04:05.701
JOB WHICH HE'S DOING TODAY SO I

03:04:05.768 --> 03:04:10.139
WANT TO PUT THAT OUT I ALSO. IF

03:04:10.205 --> 03:04:10.706
THEY CAN GET A ON. WHAT WE

03:04:10.773 --> 03:04:14.009
HEARD FROM COMPANIES AGAIN.

03:04:14.076 --> 03:04:15.644
THERE IS NO WAY I COULD

03:04:15.711 --> 03:04:17.246
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU COULD HAVE

03:04:17.312 --> 03:04:18.714
A GROUP OF MUSICIANS COMING TO

03:04:18.781 --> 03:04:21.517
PERFORM CERTAIN TIME DOING WHAT

03:04:21.583 --> 03:04:23.352
A CONDUCTOR IS TELLING THEM TO

03:04:23.419 --> 03:04:24.820
PERFORM TOGETHER YOU KNOW

THINGS A CERTAIN FORM THAT

03:04:28.924 --> 03:04:30.993
WHATEVER PASCARELLA. SO IF IT

03:04:31.059 --> 03:04:32.594
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT WE

03:04:32.661 --> 03:04:34.596
EXAMPLE OUT SYMPHONIES ALIVE

03:04:34.663 --> 03:04:36.031

03:05:02.524 --> 03:05:03.559
HOMEWORK THIS WEEK WE

03:05:03.625 --> 03:05:05.294
DEFINITELY TRIED TO LOOK AT

03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:06.595
EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE WE'VE

03:05:06.662 --> 03:05:08.030
CREATED A FRAMEWORK HOPEFULLY

03:05:08.096 --> 03:05:10.165
THAT WILL FIT FOR MOST PEOPLE.

03:05:10.232 --> 03:05:11.533
BUT LABOR LAWS EXIST AND

03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:14.236

BE RELIEVED OF THAT THEY DIDN'T

03:05:33.956 --> 03:05:34.756

03:24:47.108 --> 03:24:49.143
OF ABUSE USE AND ABUSE OF

03:24:49.210 --> 03:24:52.880
HISTORY IT IS QUICK I MEAN I

03:24:52.947 --> 03:24:54.348
CAN EVEN. THERE THERE ARE SOME.

03:24:54.415 --> 03:24:58.252
THAT HAS. IT ON. YOUNG STRONG

03:24:58.319 --> 03:25:01.622
OF A- THE EMPLOYEES THAT I CAN

03:25:01.689 --> 03:25:02.456
THINK IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE

03:25:02.523 --> 03:25:09.730
SOME FARMWORKERS TO DO FAR

03:25:09.797 --> 03:25:10.364
BETTER UNDER P. THREE THEN THEY

03:25:10.431 --> 03:25:10.998
COULD UNDER NAP EARLY RATE BUT

03:25:11.065 --> 03:25:14.769
IT'S ALL HOW. ABUSED THREE KEYS

03:25:14.835 --> 03:25:16.837
ACT PASSED OF A BOX THE SAME

03:25:16.904 --> 03:25:18.305

03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:21.776
SOMETHING THAT THAT WEIGHS LESS

03:25:21.842 --> 03:25:23.711
THAN A POUND OR YOU COULD BE

03:25:23.778 --> 03:25:25.780
PACKING SOMETHING THAT HE'S-

03:25:25.846 --> 03:25:27.081
FIVE. AND SO. I DON'T THINK

03:25:27.148 --> 03:25:29.350
THAT THE JOB REALLY LINES UP TO

03:25:29.417 --> 03:25:31.952
A PIECE RATE KIND OF SITUATION-

03:25:32.019 --> 03:25:33.187
AND ALL THE REPORTS WERE

03:25:33.254 --> 03:25:35.289
INDICATING THAT THEY'RE USING

03:25:35.356 --> 03:25:37.658
QUOTA SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT THESE

03:25:37.725 --> 03:25:39.560
WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TELLING

03:25:39.627 --> 03:25:42.663
WAREHOUSES HAVE. NOT T. QUOTA

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:45.633
SYSTEM. INTENTIONALLY COOL AND

03:25:45.700 --> 03:25:47.535
CRUDE BUT IF THEY'RE GOING TO

03:25:47.601 --> 03:25:50.237
USE IT AT LEAST MAKE EXCEPTIONS

03:25:50.304 --> 03:25:51.272
FOR BASIC HUMAN BEHAVIOR THAT

03:25:51.338 --> 03:25:53.140
THAT GOES FOR THAT'S WHAT WE

03:25:53.207 --> 03:25:54.809
THINK IN THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO

03:25:54.875 --> 03:25:56.644
USE THE STOCK MARKET OF FIND

03:25:56.711 --> 03:25:59.013
SOME OTHER WAY OF EVALUATING IF

03:25:59.080 --> 03:26:02.183
AN EMPLOYEE IS A IS DOING THEIR

03:26:02.249 --> 03:26:07.455

ENSURE THAT. THEY'RE IN

03:26:30.611 --> 03:26:31.912

03:26:31.979 --> 03:26:33.814
CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED BY THE

03:26:33.881 --> 03:26:34.982

WE ALLOWED BY STATUTE. BUT IT

03:47:03.209 --> 03:47:05.044
ALSO MAKES A RETROACTIVE TO

03:47:05.111 --> 03:47:07.146
JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THAT'S

03:47:07.213 --> 03:47:09.382

I CERTAINLY HOPE IT DOES TODAY.

03:47:15.088 --> 03:47:17.523
THEN BY THE TIME THE AGENCY

MOST OF THE COMMISSIONERS ARE

THE BILL TRY TO RESOLVE THIS

05:08:56.484 --> 05:08:58.186
SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A-

05:08:58.253 --> 05:08:59.654
POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST

05:08:59.721 --> 05:09:01.089
BETWEEN THE PERSONNEL

05:09:01.155 --> 05:09:02.490
COMMISSION AND THE BOARD ITSELF

05:09:02.557 --> 05:09:03.892
EITHER THE YOU THE BOARD IS

05:09:03.958 --> 05:09:06.995
COMMITTEE COLLEGE BOARD OR K.

05:09:07.061 --> 05:09:07.562
TWELVE BOARD HOUSE WHENEVER

05:09:07.629 --> 05:09:09.130
THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT MAY

05:09:09.197 --> 05:09:10.632

05:09:12.467 --> 05:09:15.036
LAWYER THEN DOT SO WHEN THIS

05:09:15.103 --> 05:09:18.072
LAW IS INVOKED K. ONE MORE

05:09:18.139 --> 05:09:19.474
QUESTION IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR

05:09:19.540 --> 05:09:20.675
AND THIS WAS THE QUESTION POSED

05:09:20.742 --> 05:09:22.043
BY L. A. U. S. D. BECAUSE THE

05:09:22.110 --> 05:09:23.912
BILL IS IN KEY FISCAL. THAT'S

05:09:23.978 --> 05:09:25.346
ALSO I REALIZE THAT THE BILL

05:09:25.413 --> 05:09:26.748
WOULD GO FROM HERE DIRECTLY TO

05:09:26.814 --> 05:09:27.782
THE FLOOR WE WOULD HAVE AN

05:09:27.849 --> 05:09:29.784
OPPORTUNITY- AND APPROPRIATIONS

05:09:29.851 --> 05:09:31.019
COMMITTEE THAT TO ADDRESS THIS

05:09:31.085 --> 05:09:32.787
ISSUE. IT'S NOT KEEP FISCAL

05:09:32.854 --> 05:09:35.189
BUT- THERE'S CONCERNS THAT IT

05:09:35.256 --> 05:09:36.357
HAS FISCAL IMPLICATIONS ON

05:09:36.424 --> 05:09:38.393
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;

05:09:38.459 --> 05:09:40.728
FOURTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IN

05:09:40.795 --> 05:09:42.830
THAT THEY WOULD BE. RESPONSIBLE

05:09:42.897 --> 05:09:45.333
FOR PAYING FOR OUTSIDE COUNSEL

05:09:45.400 --> 05:09:47.902
THAT SOMEONE ARGUE COULD BE AT

05:09:47.969 --> 05:09:49.203
A HIGHER COST SO COULD YOU

05:09:49.270 --> 05:09:50.939
RESPOND- TO THE FACT THAT IT'S

05:09:51.005 --> 05:09:52.140
NOT KEEP FISCAL OF THIS A

05:09:52.206 --> 05:09:54.676
UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT WE'RE-

05:09:54.742 --> 05:09:55.944
PUTTING ON DISTRICTS WELL LIKE

05:09:56.010 --> 05:09:57.378

05:09:57.445 --> 05:09:59.414
ESSENTIALLY TACKED. ON

05:09:59.480 --> 05:10:02.450
NONPHYSICAL AND D. A. R. D.

05:10:02.517 --> 05:10:04.018
EXPECTATION IS THAT THE LAW IS

05:10:04.085 --> 05:10:05.887
NOT GOING TO BE INVOKED OFTEN

05:10:05.954 --> 05:10:07.989
TELL THAT FREQUENTLY BECAUSE

05:10:08.056 --> 05:10:08.623
THERE ARE TWO MAIN. REASONS WHY

05:10:08.690 --> 05:10:10.591
IS THAT I THINK GOD FOR

05:10:10.658 --> 05:10:11.826
CONFLICT BETWEEN BODIES. CLUB
