AS A RESULT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HISTORIC. HOMELESS AND HOUSING CRISIS BOTH NEARLY HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE LIVING ON OUR STREETS LAST YEAR. THIS BILL IS BEFORE IT MAKES THE STATE A LONG TERM FINANCIAL PARTNER. TO THE CITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MERELY PARTNER AND CONSTRUCT DESPERATELY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS IT HELPS RELIEVE POVERTY CREATE JOBS MEETS OUR STATE WIDE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WITHOUT AFFECTING OUR SCHOOL FUNDING. NOW ACCORDING TO AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS PREPARED BY CARPENTERS REGIONAL COUNCIL IN THE CALIFORNIA IN PARTNERSHIP. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NEW AND RE AND REHABILITATED HOUSING BILLS. THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND JOBS AND SPUR MORE THAN SIXTY BILLION. AND. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD. THE BILL RESPONDS TO THE NEEDS OF SIT AND COUNTIES AND PROVIDE STATE OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE FUNDS ARE USE QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROMOTE TRANSIT OR IN DEVELOPMENT ADDRESS IT ALSO ADDRESS IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. FUNDS CAN BE USED ONLY ON PROJECTS APPROVED BY STATE COMMITTEE AT LEAST 50% OF ALL FUNDING MUST BE USED TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT COMPLEMENTS THE LEGISLATIVE INVESTMENTS IN SHORT TERM HOUSING BY PROVIDING ONGOING FUNDING FOR LONG TERM FOR A LONG TERM SOLUTION HOUSING CRISIS THE BILL ALIGNS WITH OTHER STATE. AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS TO ENSURE GOVERNMENT'S LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL NON STATE GENERAL FUNDS THE STATE BUDGET IS ALSO PROTECTED. THIS BILL SETS UP A STRUCTURE FOR THE PROGRAM IN A ZERO FISCAL IMPACT UNTIL THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE ALLOCATE FISCAL AUTHORITY IN THE IN THE BUDGET.

WITHOUT WILL GO TO WITNESS TESTIMONY OF COURSE YOU WILL KEEP YOUR COMMENTS UNDER TWO MINUTES AND ONLY DEAL WITH FISCAL ISSUES. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS DAVID SANDER I AM VICE MAYOR OF THE CITY VENTURED OVER RIGHT HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA I SERVE ON THE BOARD TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA CITIES I'VE ALSO BEEN A BOARD MEMBER THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES AND I AM CURRENTLY HONOR TO BE THE FOUR CHAIR FOR SAY COG. THE COG HERE IN THE AN MPO HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION I'D SAY CUT WE ARE TAKING VERY SERIOUSLY THE STATE'S MANDATE TO IMPROVE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS SITUATION AND WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO THAT BY FINDING ALTERNATIVES TO LEAPFROG DEVELOPMENT. OUR ANALYSIS IS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT WE CAN DO THAT TO INFILL DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE ARE SERIOUS BARRIERS TO INFILL DEVELOPMENT NOT JUST IN OUR REGION BUT EVERY JURISDICTION IN THE STATE WE ALL HAVE OLD COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS THE LARGELY VACANT PROPERTIES THEY WERE ONCE PROCESS. NOW NOT PROSPEROUS AND THE MEANS OF GETTING THOSE TO A PROSPEROUS INFILL SITUATION IS CHALLENGED BY INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES I WILL GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE ON FULL SYMBOL OF ART IN RANCHO CORDOVA WE AT A RESTAURANT TOUR WHO WANTED TO GO INTO AN OLD RESTAURANT LOCATION. HE APPLIED EVERYONE WAS A FAVOR THE CITY WAS IN PORT RAN INTO A PROBLEM WITH THE SEWER DISTRICT WHERE HE HAD TO IMPROVE THE OLD GREASE TRAP FROM THE PREVIOUS RESTAURANT UPDATED CURRENT VERSION HE RAN INTO TROUBLE WITH MUD THE ELECTRICITY PROVIDER. AT A CERTAIN SIZE TRANSFORMER THEY WANTED A NEWER ONE YOU WERE UNDER THE RIGHT. I'M WITH EIGHTY. HE WAS A GROUP OFTEN THE PITCH. RAN INTO. THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM IT WAS NOT OUR NEED TO BE UPDATED TO THE NEW STANDARDS ALL OF THESE THINGS ADDED TOGETHER ADDED IN THE DOLLARS TO THE COST OF HIS PROJECT SO WHAT IT USED TO DO WHAT ANY BUSINESS PERSON WHAT HE WANTS TO THE NEW SIDE OF TOWN. BUILT AS RESTAURANT WE LOST AN OPTION FOR INFILL THAT NEIGHBORHOOD LOS AN ASSET AND PEOPLE ARE DRIVING FURTHER TO GET TO THAT RESTAURANT. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW US TO INTERVENE IN THAT SITUATION AND MAKE THOSE TO LICENSE ECONOMIC FOR OUR RESIDENTS SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN A FOR. HOUSING OR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TONY GIPSON WITH ENCORE CAPITAL GROUP HERE IN OPPOSITION I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT WHILE THERE WAS A SLIGHT REDUCTION FROM 200-021-0007 HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS FOR THE AMOUNT OF EXCEPTION THEY'RE STILL ABSOLUTELY NO MEANS TEST BEING ADDED AND THAT IS AN AUTOMATIC EXEMPTION PROTECTING ALL JUDGMENT DEBTORS FROM FROM DEBTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE. THIS IS VERY COSTLY TO THE STATE WE BELIEVE THAT THE EX PARTE REQUIREMENTS SAYS THAT WE SHALL GO TO COURT HEARINGS TO DETERMINE WHERE AND WHICH BANK ACCOUNT THAT JUDGMENT DEBTORS SHOULD APPLY THE EXEMPTION TO WE BELIEVE THIS WILL CAUSE AN INFLUX TO THE STATE WITH THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL COURT HEARINGS EVERY YEAR. ADDITIONALLY THE INDEX THAT IS BEING REFERENCED IN THE BILL NOW THE M. B. S. A. C. INDEX IS A NUMBER THAT CHANGES EVERY YEAR AND SO FORMS AND PROCEDURES BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO BE UPDATED VERY REGULARLY. ALSO AN ADDITIONAL COST TO THE STATE. AND FINALLY THAT THE LOSS OF TAX REVENUE FOR CREDITORS BUSINESSES AND ANY SMALL BUSINESS THAT DOES COLLECTIONS WORK. OR HAS DEBTS. THIS COULD BE YOUR LOCAL PLUMBER. IT WILL BE COSTLY BECAUSE THIS ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS JUDGMENT DEBTORS TO ABATE SEVEN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR. IN DEBTS FOR ALL JUDGMENT DEBTORS NO QUESTIONS ASKED THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. TIM LYNCH ON BEHALF OF THE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION WE STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT POLICY CONCERNS WITH THE BILL BUT- I SURE THE CONCERNS I REGARDING THE FISCAL IMPACTS ON THE COURTS BECAUSE THE HEARING IS MANDATORY.

AT LEAST WORKING WITH ME MY STAFF TRYING TO GET A PLACE WHERE I'M MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL AN ADDITIONAL MEMBERS SAID THAT RIGHT NOW IF WE NEED TO TAKE ON THE FLOOR I STILL THINK YOU HAVE. A. A TOUGH ROAD AHEAD BUT ON THE FISCAL WE AT. THINK IT SHOULD GET OUT TODAY SO. GOOD LUCK I'VE I LIVE ON THAT ROAD. HOWEVER I LIVE ON THAT ROAD AHEAD IF WITH REGARD TO THE IMPACT THAT THIS IS FLOOD OF EX PARTE APPLICATIONS YOU KNOW THE SHELL WAS NEGOTIATED WITH THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALL THE BANKS ARE OFF THE BILL THEIR THEIR OPPOSITION SO THAT WAS A NEGOTIATED LANGUAGE THE SECOND IS THAT. REMEMBER THE DEBTORS NOW THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO GO IN AND DO A CLAIM EXEMPTION WITH A NO LOOK SEVENTEEN HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR YOU COULD SEE THAT COME CRASHING DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE GONNA HAVE SOME MONEY TO EXIST THE EX PARTY IS GOING TO BE THE INSTITUTIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THERE AND THAT'S- UP TO THEM IF THEY FEEL THAT THEY NEED. TO GET MORE MONEY AFTER THE NO LOOKS AT WHERE THEY GET THE MONEY AFTER SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR SO WE DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THAT GREAT IMPACT ON THE COURTS AFTER HE FELL OFF THE CHANGE.

HE SAID IT WAS SUCH A JOY MOUNTAINS THANK YOU. COLOR THANK YOU AND I'M SURE I'LL BE VERY BRIEF SINCE YOU SINCE YOU TOOK A BIG PIECE OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. THE COST ESTIMATE THE CALTRANS PROVIDED IS AN ABSOLUTE EMBARRASSMENT TO THE AGENCY AND THE AGENCY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITSELF. FOR DOING THIS. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ABOUT ASKING CALTRANS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE STATE HIGHWAYS THAT ARE CITY SURFACE STREETS THAT PEOPLE ARE WALKING ON AND BIKING ON. THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENSURING THAT THOSE STREETS ARE SAFE. FOR CHILDREN OR SENIORS TO CROSS THE STREET. TO RIDE A BIKE THEY SAY THEY WANT TO DO THIS BUT THEY'RE NOT DOING A AND THE BILL SIMPLY TELLS ON THE WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY DOING. A PROJECT THAT THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER DO WE STRIPED BY PLANES DO WE ACTUALLY PUT CROSS WALKS INTO THE PEOPLE CAN SAVE ACROSS THE STREET. WE'RE NOT EVEN ASKING THEM TO INITIATE NEW PROJECTS WITHIN WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY DOING A PROJECT YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. TO DO THIS CALDERON SO THEY'LL COME IN HERE AND SAID THAT IT WILL COST THEM FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER MILE. TO DO THAT THAT'S HOW THEY COME UP WITH THEIR RIDICULOUS ONE BILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG ON THE BILL WHEN WE KNOW THAT IS PROJECTS COSTING WE'VE CANVASSED AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE. ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MILE TO AT THE HIGH END SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND IF THEY COME IN WITH A FOUR POINT FIVE.

CERTAIN TOXIC CHEMICALS IN OUR BE WASTING TANKS WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD AT TRYING TO JUST OF. TO RATIONALIZE WHY THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ESTIMATED WOULD COST THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO PUT UP SIGNAGE AND WE'VE WORKED WITH THE THAT WATER BOARD AND WHEN SENATOR MINING WAS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HE RAN THIS BILL AND IT THE COST WAS FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO WE BELIEVE THAT THAT NUMBER IS OVER INFLATED.

SELECTED WITH ADULTS DEAN GILBERT ROBESON SMITH ON BEHALF OF CAN'T COUNT NOW. FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATELY OWNED CAMPGROUNDS AND RV PARKS IN THE STATE ONE THING ALL ADD TO WHAT THE SENATOR HAS SAID IS THAT AS SHE SHE'S POINTED OUT. WE ARE WORKING ACTIVELY ON MEMBERS WITH THE WATER BOARD TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL IS IDENTICAL FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. TO THE BILL THAT WAS FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS NINE YEARS AGO. THERE IS AN EXISTING PROGRAM TO BAN PRODUCTS THAT ARE JUST LIKE THE ONES WE ARE WORKING ON IN THIS BILL. IT'S HARD FOR US TO IMAGINE WHY IT WOULD COST OVER A MILLION DOLLARS TO INTEGRATE THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS INTO THAT EXISTING PROGRAM. A RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS THOSE IN OPPOSITION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FINANCES OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE IT RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL WITHOUT PROVIDING FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE COSTS. DETAILS HE IS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO AFTER COMPLYING WITH A SPECIFIED REGULATORY PROCESS BEYOND THE CHEMICALS LISTED IN THIS BILL. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL STATES ENFORCEMENT IS CONTINGENT UPON FUTURE APPROPRIATIONS BY THE LEGISLATURE. HOWEVER THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT FEE INCREASE FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL TO BE ENFORCEABLE. ABSENCE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THIS BILL RESULT IN GENERAL FUND PRESSURE TO BACK FILL THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL COUNT. ALL RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT WHAT SHE SAID OKAY THIS BILL GETS OUT WITH REPUBLICANS NOT VOTING BUT MISTER MISTER OBERNOLTE VERY NICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. AS SEEN NO AUTHORS AT THIS TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE SENATORS WHO HAVE BILLS THAT MISTER ALLEN MISS SKINNER MISTER MCGUIRE. MISS SKINNER. YOU'LL BE PRESENTING ON SB THREE TEN AS YOU MAKE YOUR WAY UP IT ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. IT'S BEEN MOVED BY MISS CARILLO AND SECONDED BY A DOCTOR QUIRK THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR MEMBERS JUST VERY BRIEFLY I WE WILL BE AMENDING THIS BILL ON THE FLOOR. AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE WILL BE TAKING WILL HAVE THE D. A.'S NEUTRAL ON THE BILL SO THEY WILL REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION WE JUST FINISHED THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THE HEAD OF THE DA SAYS THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE DA SENSATIONAL MEETING MEETING WITH MY STAFF TOMORROW. TOO AND THERE WAS AMENDMENTS WON'T AFFECT MAKE THE RIGHT TO SERVE ON A JURY PARALLEL TO OUR CURRENT RIGHT TO VOTE BUT IT WILL ADDITIONALLY EXCLUDE FELONY XXL FENDERS SO PRIMARILY IT JUST PUTS THE BILL IN THE SAME IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE NOW IN CALIFORNIA. GIVE A FORMER ON THE RIGHT TO VOTE WE WOULD BE PARALLEL IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE ON A JURY ONCE WE MAKE THE AMENDMENTS. WITHOUT A WITH MY- WITNESSES THANK YOU ON THE FISCAL. MAYBE. I YEAH GO AHEAD I'M SORRY SORRY. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BRANDON WOODS IN THE PUBLIC FUNDED I'M TO COUNTY AND PASS PRESIDENCY PDA LIKE MICHAEL PRESENTED HERE I THINK I'M UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO DISCUSS THIS BILL I'VE BEEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS NOW. I AM THE FIRST BLACK CHIEF PUBLIC FOR THE AMERICAN HISTORY AND CURRENTLY I AM THE ONLY BLACK CHIEF PUBLIC DEFENDER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER KATIE FOR PEOPLE ACCUSED OF CRIMES. I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER TRYING TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK WHEN THEY'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME. SO I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW OFTEN I'VE SAT AT A TABLE LIKE THIS WHERE MY CLIENT WHO IS BLACK OR BROWN HAS BEEN. CHARGED WITH A CRIME GOING TO JURY TRIAL AND THEY'D HAVE A JURY. WHO LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THEM. THIS RULE HARKENS BACK TO A TIME WHERE JURIES WERE COMPOSED OF ALL WHITE MEN. SO WE HAVE SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES IN THIS RULE THIS LAW.WE'VE ALL READ ABOUT CASE OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS THAT STEM FROM RACIAL BIAS IN POLICING PROSECUTION AND WE SEEN JURIES THAT ARE NOT DIVERSE CONTINUE TO UPHOLD THESE CONVICTIONS THAT A WRONGFUL. AS WE KNOW RIGHT NOW BLACK PEOPLE SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY BE ROUGHLY CONVICTED OF MURDER AND WHAT PEOPLE. SB THREE TEN AS OF LAW THAT CAN FIX THAT. CURRENTLY OVER 30% OF BLACK MEN ARE. KEPT FROM SERVING AS YOURS NO ONE WOULD PUT A LAW IN PLACE LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW. SO. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER AS A CENTER SAID THIS BILL WILL NOT MAKE IT AUTOMATIC THAT FELONS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT AS JURORS THOUGH STILL ADORE POSSUM PLACE CLUB OR THE OR THE JURY SELECTION ANYONE WHO HAS A BIAS WILL BE ABLE TO BE EXCLUDED BY THE JUDGE. OR BY A PROSECUTOR DE A DEFENSE ATTORNEY I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF FEAR. AROUND THIS. THE PLACE THAT FEAR COMES FROM OPPOSITION. OUR PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF PEOPLE HAVE FELONY CONVICTIONS THEY'RE SCARED OF PEOPLE WHO. OUR OTHERS AND THAT FEAR REALLY IS WHAT IS TEARING THE COUNTRY APART RIGHT NOW. SO I AM HONORED TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF YOU ADVOCATING FOR SIMPLE CHANGE IN THE LAW THAT IS VERY VERY MINOR FISCAL IMPACT. THIS LAW WILL BE ABLE TO BRING BACK COMMUNITY HUMANITY TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. SO AS I CONCLUDE I JUST WANNA TELL YOU BRIEFLY I'M YOUR TIME IS UP I'M SORRY AND I DO WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE WE NEED TO KEEP IT TO A FISCAL I ALSO THIS IS. REALLY UNUSUAL AND SO I'M SORRY SEVEN NOT DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU SKINNER. THE AMENDMENTS YOU OUTLINE FOR TAKING TO THE FLOOR WILL REQUIRE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TO PULL THIS BILL BACK HERE. BECAUSE LOOKING INTO. WHETHER SOMEBODY HAS A SEX OFFENSE WILL ADD. POSSIBLY A COST WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO IF IT'S ALL RIGHT SOME ASK THE MOTION AND THE SECOND TO WITHDRAW THEIR MOTION. PUT IT OVER FOR A WEEK MAKE THE AMENDMENTS HERE AND HERE IT NEXT WEEK. DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU. YES THAT WOULD WORK. OKAY WITH THAT IT IS A MAKERS. ALL RIGHT SO MUCH CAREER WITH YOU HER MOTION THAT MEANS WHAT SINCE EVERYBODY'S HERE LET'S GO AHEAD AND FOR TESTIMONY ONLY HERE THROUGH THE SUPPORTERS PLEASE ONLY TO THE FISCAL WHICH IS KIND OF IRRELEVANT RIGHT NOW BUT IF YOU WANT TO JUST REGISTER YOUR SUPPORT EIGHT I'M SORRY IT'S JUST THE AMENDMENTS WROTE TRIGGER PULLING BACK AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MISTER CALDERON DO THAT ON THE FLOOR NEXT WEEK SO. LET'S JUST CLEAN IT UP HERE WHICH I THINK WILL HELP ME YEAH. THANK YOU OKAY. ALL RIGHT I AM. JAMES BUT ALL I'M A PROFESSOR AT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH. I'M ALSO PRACTICING ATTORNEY INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M A CONVICTED FELON. SO WHAT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH THE SET UP IS THIS IDEA THAT I COULD TRY CASE IN ANY COURT HOUSE THE STATE BUT YET I COULDN'T SIT ON A JURY IN ANY COURT HOUSE THE STATE EVEN MY IN A MINOR CIVIL DISPUTE. TO THE FISCAL POINT I'VE DONE YEARS OF RESEARCH ON SALINGER EXCLUSION YOU CAN GOOGLE IT TONIGHT AND EVERY ARTICLE YOU FINAL BE ONE WRITTEN BY ME. I DID A LOT OF WORK IN MAINE THE ONLY STATE THAT PER SE HAS NO DISQUALIFICATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONVICTED OF FELONIES. AND I CAN TELL YOU AS FAR AS FISKE. IT'S NOTHING. THE TOURNEY'S RUN THE RAP SHEETS AND OVER THE- TEN OVER THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND THEN THEY PROCEED WITH WHAT DEAR AS ANY OTHER STATE WHAT. AS FAR AS- FISCAL I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT WHICH IS THE THREAT CONVICTED FELONS POSED TO THE JURY PROCESS FIRST THE BENEFITS YOU MAY REACH. BY HAVING FOLKS A FELONY CONVICTIONS TAKE PART IN THIS PROCESS. WE KNOW THAT THIS PROCESS CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE IN TERMS OF RE ENTRY. TO THE SELF ESTEEM TURNED A CRIMINAL THIS INSTANCE. FRANKLY IT MAKES THAT PROCESS A LOT SMOOTHER RIGHT. WHEN YOU ARE REMINDED PERPETUALLY THAT YOU ARE DIFFERENT WHEN YOU ARE REMINDED PERPETUALLY THAT YOU. CAN'T DO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE CAN DO. IT MAKES REINTEGRATION RE ENTRY THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. SO WHILE THERE MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS FISCAL ADVANTAGES TO THIS ON THE FRONT END. THERE CERTAINLY ARE IN THE BACK AND BY HAVING HEALTHIER MORE PRODUCTIVE PARTICIPATING CITIZENS. LOOK I'VE DONE RESEARCH ON THIS FOR LIKE I SAID TEN YEARS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS MINIMAL TO NO THREAT AND THAT. MINIMAL TO NO THREAT INCLUDES FOLKS. JUST FOR THE RECORD ON SUPERVISION OR FOLKS WITH SEX OFFENSES. THE WAY MAIN DOES IT IS THE WAY I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA. ON A DO IT I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT WHERE WE'RE GOING. THAT'S ALL I HAVE ALL RIGHT.

A PART OF TO BE ANALYSIS RAISE CONCERNS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE THE SPECIFICITY REQUIRED FOR THE A TO BE DETERMINED HOW THEY WOULD COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THEREFORE THIS BILL COULD RESULT IN GENERAL FUND COSTS FOR THE FTV WE KNOW THAT IF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS UNABLE TO CONSOLIDATE JURY MASTERLESS USING STE TAXI TAX FILER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OF TV IT COULD LEAD TO INCREASED LITIGATION AGAINST TRIAL COURTS FOR FAILURE TO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE JURY POOL GIVEN THE COURTS WOULD BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATURE BY NOT UTILIZING ALL THE JURY MASTERLESS.
