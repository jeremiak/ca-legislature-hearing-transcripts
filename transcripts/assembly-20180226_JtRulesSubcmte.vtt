UNBIASED INVESTIGATION.

00:37:57.642 --> 00:38:01.613 region:rollup2
THAT INVESTIGATION MUST BE

00:37:59.544 --> 00:38:03.148 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE IN NATURE. AND YET

00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:05.116 region:rollup2
LIMITED IN THE NUMBER OF

00:38:03.148 --> 00:38:07.085 region:rollup2

YET IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO RESPOND.

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:23.134 region:rollup2
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:25.303 region:rollup2
PREVENT.

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:27.138 region:rollup2
PREVENTION REQUIRES EDUCATION

00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:28.840 region:rollup2
AND TRAINING OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:31.309 region:rollup2
AND MANAGERS

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:33.444 region:rollup2
HOWEVER EVEN EFFECTIVE TRAINING

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:35.713 region:rollup2
CANNOT OCCUR IN A VACUUM IN MUST

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:37.782 region:rollup2
BE PART OF THE HOLISTIC CULTURE.

00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:43.888 region:rollup2
WHEN THE TERM SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:46.224 region:rollup2
IS USE WHAT COMES TO MIND OF

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:47.692 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT THIS SMALLER

00:38:46.224 --> 00:38:49.727 region:rollup2
BUT PERSISTENT AND INTOLERABLE

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:51.930 region:rollup2
ACTS

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:53.932 region:rollup2
IT IS THE EXTREME ACTS

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:55.733 region:rollup2
THE OX WE HEAR ABOUT ON THE NEWS

00:38:53.932 --> 00:38:58.403 region:rollup2

BILL REILLY HARVEY WEINSTEIN

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:04.742 region:rollup2
YET HARASSMENT CAN TAKE MANY

00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:06.477 region:rollup2
FORMS AND EMPLOYEES NEED TO

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:08.713 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT BEHAVIOR THAT

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:11.282 region:rollup2
MAY BE SMALLER IN SCOPE BUT

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:14.852 region:rollup2
STILL PERSISTENT. AND INTO IT AN

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:15.920 region:rollup2
INTOLERABLE ACTS OF HARASSMENT.

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:17.956 region:rollup2
WE MUST THEREFORE DEFINE WHAT

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.690 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTES HARASSMENT FROM THE

00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:20.425 region:rollup2
BEGINNING OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.693 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT.

00:39:20.425 --> 00:39:24.062 region:rollup2
WE MUST PROVIDE THEM WITH THE

00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:26.197 region:rollup2
TOOLS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY WHAT

00:39:24.062 --> 00:39:28.333 region:rollup2
IT IS. WHY IT IS A PROBLEM

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:30.301 region:rollup2

EXPECT CLOSURE?

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:37.575 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE KEY TO ENSURING THAT

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:39.744 region:rollup2
OUR ACCESS AND PROCEDURES ARE

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:41.512 region:rollup2
PROPERLY UTILIZED.

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:42.981 region:rollup2
EDUCATION MIGHT MUST TAKE THE

WRITTEN POLICY.

00:39:45.016 --> 00:39:48.686 region:rollup2
EASY TO LOCATE AND EASY TO

REFERENCE.

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:52.290 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SHOULD BE INTERACTIVE.

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:54.592 region:rollup2
I CANNOT SHY AWAY FROM TOPICS

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:56.160 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE US UNCOMFORTABLE WE

00:39:54.592 --> 00:39:58.162 region:rollup2
MUST SPEAK ABOUT IT FREELY. AND

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.831 region:rollup2
EMPOWER ALL MANAGERS TO HELP

00:39:58.162 --> 00:40:01.733 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY BUT CONFIDENCE AND

00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:04.235 region:rollup2
COMPASSION.

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:05.870 region:rollup2
WE MUST INFUSE CIVILITY WITHOUT

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:10.341 region:rollup2
EMPOWER OUR COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK

00:40:08.273 --> 00:40:14.045 region:rollup2
UP AS BYSTANDERS WITNESSING

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:15.413 region:rollup2
UNWELCOME BEHAVIORS.

00:40:14.045 --> 00:40:17.749 region:rollup2

BECOME BRITTLE.

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:32.930 region:rollup2

IS THIS PROTOCOL NECESSARY IS IT

00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:56.487 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT.

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:58.723 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE GAUGE OUR CURRENT

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:09.200 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR EMPLOYEES

00:47:57.007 --> 00:48:00.678 region:rollup2
AND MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO.

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:02.880 region:rollup2
TALKING OPENLY AND REGULARLY

00:48:00.678 --> 00:48:04.081 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT SHIFTS

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.249 region:rollup2
THE CULTURE OF VIOLENCE THAT AS

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:06.817 region:rollup2
WELL ALLOWED SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:08.052 region:rollup2
FLOURISH.

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:10.354 region:rollup2
WE ONLY HAVE TO LOOK TO COLLEGE

00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:11.555 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES TO SEE HOW A CULTURAL

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:12.923 region:rollup2
SHIFT AROUND SILENCE CAN

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:14.725 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REPORT

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:16.527 region:rollup2
SEXUAL VIOLENCE.

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:18.229 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

00:48:16.527 --> 00:48:19.997 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVE COMMITTED

00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:20.631 region:rollup2
TO BETTER ADDRESSING PREVENTING

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:22.333 region:rollup2
AND RESPONDING TO SEXUAL

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:24.034 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE.

00:48:22.333 --> 00:48:26.036 region:rollup2
MANY HAVE SEEN INCREASES IN

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:27.471 region:rollup2
REPORTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE.

00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:29.039 region:rollup2
THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:30.374 region:rollup2
NOT MORE SEXUAL ASSAULT HAVE

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:31.842 region:rollup2
OCCURRED BUT RATHER THAT

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:33.744 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES HAVE STARTED TO CREATE

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:35.412 region:rollup2
CLAIMANTS WHERE SURVIVORS ARE

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:37.114 region:rollup2
MORE COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:39.016 region:rollup2
AND REPORTING THEIR EXPERIENCES.

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:41.886 region:rollup2
THIS IS A GOOD THING.

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:41.886 region:rollup2
WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE THE ROLE

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:44.455 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS AND WORKS TO CLOSE

00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:45.556 region:rollup2
THOSE GAPS

00:48:44.455 --> 00:48:46.857 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTS WHERE WOMEN A

00:48:45.556 --> 00:48:48.125 region:rollup2
ROUTINELY ISOLATED AND

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:49.960 region:rollup2
INTIMIDATED ARE RIGHT FOR SEXUAL

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:51.896 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.297 region:rollup2
IN CLOSING SUPPORTING SURVIVORS

00:48:51.896 --> 00:48:54.799 region:rollup2
IS CRUCIAL FOR PROMOTING A

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:56.567 region:rollup2
CULTURE OF INTOLERANCE FOR

00:48:54.799 --> 00:48:57.835 region:rollup2
SEXUAL VIOLENCE WE MUST PAY

00:48:56.567 --> 00:48:59.236 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO THE VARYING

00:48:57.835 --> 00:49:01.172 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES AND NEEDS OF

00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:02.907 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS. AND WE MUST ALSO

00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:04.542 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL

00:49:02.907 --> 00:49:06.443 region:rollup2
AND CULTURAL NORMS THAT HAVE

00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:07.812 region:rollup2
ALLOWED SEXUAL VIOLENCE RUNS

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:09.180 region:rollup2
RAMPANT IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND

00:49:07.812 --> 00:49:10.948 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND COMMIT TO

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:13.818 region:rollup2
CHANGING NAM. THINK YOU SO MUCH

00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:14.885 region:rollup2
FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY.

00:49:13.818 --> 00:49:16.053 region:rollup2
THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:17.555 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS NOW AND I JUST HAVE

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:19.890 region:rollup2
ONE QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND

00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:22.993 region:rollup2
JUST TO START OFF.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:24.695 region:rollup2
.

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:27.364 region:rollup2
SO CLEARLY THERE ARE CHALLENGES

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:29.366 region:rollup2
TO. ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO COME

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:30.901 region:rollup2
FORWARD HERE THERE WAS SEXUAL

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:32.803 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:34.138 region:rollup2
AYE IN THE ASSEMBLY SUPERVISORS

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:35.806 region:rollup2
ARE GIVEN AN EXTRA TWENTY

00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:36.941 region:rollup2
MINUTES OF TRAINING. BUT IT

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:38.342 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO ME THAT IN TWENTY

00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:40.144 region:rollup2
MINUTES MAYBE ALL YOU CAN DO IS

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:41.679 region:rollup2
TELL THEM HOW TO REPORT. AND BY

00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:42.947 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE DON'T REQUIRE PEOPLE

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:44.048 region:rollup2
TO REPORT TO THE SUPERVISORS

00:49:42.947 --> 00:49:45.816 region:rollup2
THAT CAN ACTUALLY REPORT

00:49:44.048 --> 00:49:46.584 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO HUMAN RESOURCES THEY

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.752 region:rollup2
CAN REPORT TO A NUMBER OF

00:49:46.584 --> 00:49:50.187 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS. BUT IT SEEMS THAT

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:51.755 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:53.791 region:rollup2
OF HELPING PEOPLE.

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:55.659 region:rollup2
FACE THOSE CHALLENGES THAT IS A

00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:57.094 region:rollup2
LOT OF ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:59.497 region:rollup2
ON MANDATORY REPORTERS AND

00:49:57.094 --> 00:50:01.499 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS TO KNOW HOW TO.

00:49:59.497 --> 00:50:02.533 region:rollup2
TAKE THOSE REPORTS AND TO MAKE

00:50:01.499 --> 00:50:05.269 region:rollup2
EVERYONE THAT THEY COME IN

00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:07.104 region:rollup2
CONTACT WITH UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:09.673 region:rollup2
THERE IS A WAY TO REPORT THAT

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:11.041 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW HOME AND AND TO BE

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:12.476 region:rollup2
MORE ENCOURAGING OF REPORTING

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:14.378 region:rollup2
WENT WHEN THESE WHEN.

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:16.914 region:rollup2
THERE ARE. ISSUES IN THE

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:19.683 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE SO WHAT WHAT DOES.

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:21.652 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING LOOK LIKE

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:24.555 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS THERE

00:50:21.652 --> 00:50:25.623 region:rollup2
ANY BEST STANDARD OUT THERE.

00:50:24.555 --> 00:50:27.391 region:rollup2
PACIFIC WE FOR MANDATORY

00:50:25.623 --> 00:50:29.393 region:rollup2
REPORTERS AND SUPERVISORS.

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:30.194 region:rollup2
.

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:31.295 region:rollup2
I I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE

00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:33.097 region:rollup2
SAME TYPE OF TRAINING MAYBE

00:50:31.295 --> 00:50:34.665 region:rollup2
THAT'S GIVEN TO TO THE MEMBER

00:50:33.097 --> 00:50:36.066 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WANT WE'VE HER ARE ON

00:50:34.665 --> 00:50:36.634 region:rollup2
THE OTHER END OF THE TELEPHONE

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:37.801 region:rollup2
OR WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING A

00:50:36.634 --> 00:50:39.603 region:rollup2
LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT. DO YOU

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:41.038 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY IDEAS OF HOW WHAT WE

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:43.541 region:rollup2
CAN LOOK TO.

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:46.210 region:rollup2
TO BEEF UP WHAT'S CLEARLY.

00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:47.611 region:rollup2
I AT THIS POINT IN AN ADEQUATE

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.146 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TRAINING THAT'S GIVEN

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:51.282 region:rollup2
TO THE THAT SORT OF FRONT LINE

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:52.716 region:rollup2
OF INDIVIDUALS.

00:50:51.282 --> 00:50:55.786 region:rollup2
SURE THINK YOU CHAIR FRIEDMAN.

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:57.521 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD SAY THAT I.

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:58.889 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I CAL BECAUSE SO WE'RE

00:50:57.521 --> 00:51:01.191 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUSED ON.

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:02.726 region:rollup2
PROVIDING A TRAUMA INFORMED

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:04.228 region:rollup2
APPROACH I FIND NOT TO BE.

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:05.896 region:rollup2
A VERY SIGNIFICANT PLACE TO

00:51:04.228 --> 00:51:07.331 region:rollup2
START IS HAVING PEOPLE

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:08.799 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN SOMEONE

00:51:07.331 --> 00:51:10.334 region:rollup2
COMES FORWARD TO REPORT OF

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:12.970 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ASSAULT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:51:10.334 --> 00:51:13.637 region:rollup2
TRAUMA THAT IS ALSO COMING WITH

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.339 region:rollup2
THAT. AND.

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:17.474 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY NEED JUST

00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:19.109 region:rollup2
BORN KNOWING HOW TO DEAL WITH

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:21.111 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND THEIR TRAUMA.

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:22.646 region:rollup2
AND SO TRAINING AROUND WHAT

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:24.982 region:rollup2
TRAUMA LOOKS LIKE HOW TRAUMA

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:26.984 region:rollup2
IMPACTS PEOPLE ON IS IS IT CAN'T

00:51:24.982 --> 00:51:28.719 region:rollup2
BE DONE IN TWENTY MINUTES AND IS

00:51:26.984 --> 00:51:30.321 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. AIMS WE

00:51:28.719 --> 00:51:32.556 region:rollup2
WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:33.691 region:rollup2
COMING TOWARDS US HOW PEOPLE

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:35.626 region:rollup2
RESPOND.

00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:37.595 region:rollup2
TO A SURVIVOR WHEN THEY HAVE TO

00:51:35.626 --> 00:51:39.129 region:rollup2
CLOSE DISCLOSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:41.332 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:43.167 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY CONTINUE FORWARD.

00:51:41.332 --> 00:51:45.035 region:rollup2
I'M IN THE REPORTING PROCESS

00:51:43.167 --> 00:51:47.404 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY GET COUNSELING I'M

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:49.006 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT THEY DO NEXT TO.

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:50.307 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH THEIR TRAUMA AND HEAL

00:51:49.006 --> 00:51:50.774 region:rollup2
FROM THAT

00:51:50.307 --> 00:51:52.443 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S VERY

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:54.078 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:51:52.443 --> 00:51:57.047 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO THINK THAT.

00:51:54.078 --> 00:51:58.682 region:rollup2
HAVING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND A THE

00:51:57.047 --> 00:52:00.751 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:02.586 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS GIVING PEOPLE OPTIONS

00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:04.622 region:rollup2
GIVING SURVIVORS OPTIONS IS

00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:05.823 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S THAT

00:52:04.622 --> 00:52:07.391 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN BE A WEALTH OF

00:52:05.823 --> 00:52:08.759 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND LET THEM KNOW

00:52:07.391 --> 00:52:10.527 region:rollup2
WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AND

00:52:08.759 --> 00:52:12.830 region:rollup2
WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IS

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:13.530 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL.

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:14.398 region:rollup2
TERRIFIC THANK YOU SENATOR

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.234 region:rollup2

AND AND CULTURE CHANGE IN THE

00:52:21.038 --> 00:52:24.575 region:rollup2
ROLE OF TRAINING WITHIN IT. ALL

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.709 region:rollup2
BUT WHICH I'VE BEEN READING A

00:52:24.575 --> 00:52:27.911 region:rollup2
LOT ABOUT.

LOTS OF YOU KNOW MIXED FEELINGS

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:30.848 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ROLE OF TRAINING

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:32.149 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT LACK OF

00:52:30.848 --> 00:52:34.551 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IT'S BEHAVIOR CHANGE.

00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:36.520 region:rollup2
SO I WONDER IF.

EXPERIENCE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE

00:52:38.322 --> 00:52:42.926 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF START.

00:52:40.057 --> 00:52:45.562 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE BEGINNING.

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:47.498 region:rollup2

HARASSMENT IS IT YOU KNOW

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:28.439 region:rollup2

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:42.019 region:rollup2
EVEN WHEN OUR VISITORS ARE

00:53:39.483 --> 00:53:44.421 region:rollup2
COMING TO THE MUSEUM WHERE NOT.

00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:46.457 region:rollup2
BRINGING OUR OUR BY A CEASE ART

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:48.992 region:rollup2
THERE ARE IMPLICIT BISI SORT AND

00:53:46.457 --> 00:53:50.327 region:rollup2
IN NOT WELCOMING SET CERTAIN

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:51.862 region:rollup2
GROUPS. SO I THINK.

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:54.198 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY VERY

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:55.899 region:rollup2
VITAL TO HAVE CONTINUOUS

00:53:54.198 --> 00:53:57.301 region:rollup2
IMPLICIT BIAS. AND TO CHANGE

00:53:55.899 --> 00:54:00.037 region:rollup2
THOSE AT.

00:53:57.301 --> 00:54:02.306 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE DOES GENERAL IDEAS

00:54:00.037 --> 00:54:03.907 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE HIVE OF RULES OF

00:54:02.306 --> 00:54:06.043 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:11.248 region:rollup2
SEXES RACES.

00:54:06.043 --> 00:54:14.017 region:rollup2
OF ALSO ARE ALL ABOUT.

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:15.953 region:rollup2
IT DOES I REALLY TAKES UNPACKING

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:17.988 region:rollup2
I'M SO MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE ALL

00:54:15.953 --> 00:54:20.891 region:rollup2
GROWN UP AND AS A SOCIETY.

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:22.826 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE IS A LOT OF OF

00:54:20.891 --> 00:54:25.863 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT ISSUES BROADER

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:28.398 region:rollup2
ISSUES OF OPPRESSION AND RULES

00:54:25.863 --> 00:54:30.601 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE ALL PLAYED. ON AND I

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:32.503 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT I IT IT'S NOT THE

00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:34.471 region:rollup2
EDUCATION THAT'S THE ISSUE IT'S

00:54:32.503 --> 00:54:35.973 region:rollup2
IT'S HOW WE INTERACT SO IT'S THE

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:37.474 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT WE PUT INTO PLACE

00:54:35.973 --> 00:54:40.210 region:rollup2
AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE

00:54:37.474 --> 00:54:41.311 region:rollup2
CREATE.

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:42.780 region:rollup2
ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I WOULD

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:46.049 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO JUST

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:47.451 region:rollup2
BUILD A SYSTEM. TO REPORT AND

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:49.052 region:rollup2
CREATE SAFE REPORTING AFTER THE

00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:51.588 region:rollup2
FACT

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:53.223 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A GOAL AROUND PREVENTION

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:54.758 region:rollup2
AS WELL SO THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:55.926 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION. IN TERMS OF

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:57.895 region:rollup2
CULTURE SHIFT IN THE ROLE

00:54:55.926 --> 00:54:59.429 region:rollup2
TRAINEE PLAYS IN THAT TO TWO

00:54:57.895 --> 00:55:00.898 region:rollup2
MORE QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR IF I

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:02.833 region:rollup2
MAY. UM.

00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:04.835 region:rollup2
TO.

00:55:02.833 --> 00:55:06.570 region:rollup2
METS NATHAN HOW MANY EMPLOYEES

00:55:04.835 --> 00:55:07.738 region:rollup2
OBNOXIOUS MUSEUM OF WE HAVE

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.406 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

00:55:07.738 --> 00:55:09.973 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND A SEVEN HUNDRED

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:11.942 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERS PER ENTOMOLOGIST

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:13.577 region:rollup2
GOAL.

00:55:11.942 --> 00:55:15.445 region:rollup2
SO OUR VOLUNTEERS INCORPORATED

00:55:13.577 --> 00:55:17.314 region:rollup2
IN NEED TO GO THROUGH TRAIN IN

00:55:15.445 --> 00:55:20.017 region:rollup2
THE REPORTING SO THAT ALL THAT

00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:22.319 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE STRUCTURE. IMPECCABLE

00:55:20.017 --> 00:55:24.121 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERS A AN EMPLOYEE TAKE IT

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:24.655 region:rollup2
DAY TO GO THROUGH TRAINING YOU

00:55:24.121 --> 00:55:25.956 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

00:55:24.655 --> 00:55:28.358 region:rollup2
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO LIMIT THE

00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:29.226 region:rollup2
NUMBER PARTICIPANTS WAS THE WORD

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:30.827 region:rollup2
YOU USED.

00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:31.662 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS I ASSUME YOU

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:33.831 region:rollup2
MEANT THE NUMBER PEOPLE

00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:34.965 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING INVESTIGATE CORRECT

00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:36.300 region:rollup2
OKAY I WANT TO MAKE SURE I WAS

00:55:34.965 --> 00:55:37.634 region:rollup2
CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.169 region:rollup2
AND HOW IN BOTH OF YOUR

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:40.671 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU ARE MANAGED

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:42.906 region:rollup2
ANONYMOUS REPORTING.

00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:44.975 region:rollup2
I HAVE.

00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:47.177 region:rollup2
I HAVE AND THIS NEW SYSTEM THAT

00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:49.279 region:rollup2
WE HIVE SPEAK UP ANY CHEN.

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:51.381 region:rollup2
.

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:53.383 region:rollup2
EVER SINCE WE INSTITUTED WE HOP

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:55.519 region:rollup2
HOT ABOUT SEVEN ANONYMOUS

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:56.987 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS AND THEY'VE BEEN.

00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:58.689 region:rollup2
.

00:55:56.987 --> 00:56:00.991 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:03.894 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN.

00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:07.097 region:rollup2
VERY SOFT TOUCH ISSUES THAT A

00:56:03.894 --> 00:56:09.1000 region:rollup2
BIRD BEEN BROUGHT TO US LIKE.

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:11.368 region:rollup2
A AND MANAGERS BEHAVIOR LET'S

00:56:09.1000 --> 00:56:12.769 region:rollup2
SAY TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE'S

00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:14.271 region:rollup2
WEIGHT WHICH WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:15.973 region:rollup2
SO IT HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING

00:56:14.271 --> 00:56:17.474 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN HEAVY DUTY.

00:56:15.973 --> 00:56:19.509 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:20.777 region:rollup2
STILL WE LOOK INTO IT WE ADDRESS

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:22.279 region:rollup2
SAID RESPOND.

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:24.514 region:rollup2
AND THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS

00:56:22.279 --> 00:56:26.917 region:rollup2
ANONYMOUSLY REPORTED WILL

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:28.852 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM US.

00:56:26.917 --> 00:56:30.287 region:rollup2
AND AND I.

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:32.556 region:rollup2
THIS IS PROBABLY AN UNFAIR

00:56:30.287 --> 00:56:34.157 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND I'M GOING TO SAY

00:56:32.556 --> 00:56:36.226 region:rollup2
THAT AND THEN AFTER ANYWAY.

00:56:34.157 --> 00:56:37.661 region:rollup2
GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHY DO

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:40.230 region:rollup2
YOU ASSUME THOSE WERE ANONYMOUS

00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:40.864 region:rollup2
WAS IT FEAR OF RETALIATION OR

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.398 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU THINK MAY HAVE BEEN

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:44.968 region:rollup2
THE MOST.

00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:48.005 region:rollup2
FACTOR.

00:56:44.968 --> 00:56:51.074 region:rollup2
I AM NOT SURE EXACTLY I THINK

00:56:48.005 --> 00:56:52.843 region:rollup2
NOT SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL THAT

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:53.744 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T WANT TO THROW OTHER

00:56:52.843 --> 00:56:55.946 region:rollup2
PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS BUT IT'S

00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:57.648 region:rollup2
JUST THAT. IT'S A SMALL BEHAVIOR

00:56:55.946 --> 00:56:59.483 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS CORRECTION AND THEY

00:56:57.648 --> 00:57:01.618 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN

00:56:59.483 --> 00:57:02.919 region:rollup2
GIVING THEIR NAME GOT IT IN ONE.

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:05.155 region:rollup2
AND LAST QUESTION FOR ME IN THIS

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:07.457 region:rollup2
IS DIRECTED TO MS KLEIN JIMENEZ

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:07.958 region:rollup2
BASING YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:09.359 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:10.727 region:rollup2
EVEN.

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:12.362 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION YOU GET WHAT I'M

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:13.263 region:rollup2
CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR PERSPECTIVE

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.831 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:16.099 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:17.267 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN A

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:19.236 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF TOOL THAT ON THE

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:21.171 region:rollup2
MARKET NEXT. I'M WONDERING.

00:57:19.236 --> 00:57:23.473 region:rollup2
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IF

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:25.776 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY. IS HELPFUL WITH

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:27.411 region:rollup2
REPORTING.

00:57:25.776 --> 00:57:29.146 region:rollup2
I THINK IT CAN BE I THINK WHEN

00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:30.580 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO ANY LARGE

00:57:29.146 --> 00:57:33.784 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION WHETHER IT'S A

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:35.052 region:rollup2
COLLEGE OR I'M WHAT HAVE YOU.

00:57:33.784 --> 00:57:37.020 region:rollup2
AYE WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE

00:57:35.052 --> 00:57:38.488 region:rollup2
APPROACH AND SO THAT'S GOING TO

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.190 region:rollup2
INCLUDE TRAINING THAT'S GOING TO

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:41.758 region:rollup2
INCLUDE CHANGES TO THE

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:43.694 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT BY MY INCLUDE

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:46.096 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICALLY IN AND.

00:57:43.694 --> 00:57:47.698 region:rollup2
APPLICATION BASED FEATURES SO I

00:57:46.096 --> 00:57:48.732 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT DEFINITELY DEPENDS

00:57:47.698 --> 00:57:50.300 region:rollup2
ON.

00:57:48.732 --> 00:57:51.768 region:rollup2
THE WHAT THE GOALS ARE IT

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.936 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CULTURE IS

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:54.304 region:rollup2
OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:56.006 region:rollup2
TRYING TO IMPACTS BUT I

00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:56.440 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THINK THAT THERE CAN

00:57:56.006 --> 00:57:59.109 region:rollup2
BE A PLACE FOR IT.

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:01.345 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:57:59.109 --> 00:58:03.347 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA.

00:58:01.345 --> 00:58:04.915 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THINK YOU

00:58:03.347 --> 00:58:07.951 region:rollup2
FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. I HAVE

00:58:04.915 --> 00:58:09.820 region:rollup2
A QUESTION ON I THINK IT WAS.

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:11.588 region:rollup2
MISS CLIMB THE MENACE THAT SAID

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.623 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO PUT STRONG POLICIES

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:15.125 region:rollup2
IN PLACE.

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:16.860 region:rollup2
SO I'M WONDERING HOW WE DO THAT

00:58:15.125 --> 00:58:19.963 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:22.165 region:rollup2
POLICY HERE AT THE CAPITOL. BUT

00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:23.633 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY HASN'T WORKED AS

00:58:22.165 --> 00:58:25.369 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN SO WHAT KIND OF

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:27.904 region:rollup2
STRONG POLICIES TO BE PUT IN

00:58:25.369 --> 00:58:32.075 region:rollup2
PLACE SO THAT ARE ZERO TOLERANCE

00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:33.443 region:rollup2
POLICY ACTUALLY WORKS.

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:35.579 region:rollup2
BUT I QUESTION IT MIGHT NOT BE

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:37.714 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE THAT THE POLICY ITSELF

00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:38.949 region:rollup2
IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH BUT AGAIN I

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:41.151 region:rollup2
THINK I MENTIONED DOT.

00:58:38.949 --> 00:58:43.053 region:rollup2
A CULTURE A TOXIC CULTURE CAN

00:58:41.151 --> 00:58:44.888 region:rollup2
REALLY UNDERMINE EVEN THE PAST

00:58:43.053 --> 00:58:45.489 region:rollup2
POLICY AND SO BOTH OF THOSE

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:48.992 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:58:45.489 --> 00:58:50.761 region:rollup2
REALLY SHOULD BE AT PLAY ON NOT

00:58:48.992 --> 00:58:52.496 region:rollup2
ONLY ME AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:58:50.761 --> 00:58:53.930 region:rollup2
THAT THE POLICY MAY NOT BE

00:58:52.496 --> 00:58:55.999 region:rollup2
STRONG ENOUGH BUT IS THE POLICY

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:58.035 region:rollup2
CLEAR IS IT EASY FOR FOLKS TO

00:58:55.999 --> 00:59:00.003 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU SEE. AS A

00:58:58.035 --> 00:59:01.171 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO PEOPLE

00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:01.805 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE'S A ZERO

00:59:01.171 --> 00:59:03.974 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE POLICY.

00:59:01.805 --> 00:59:04.574 region:rollup2
SO I LOOK AT THE

00:59:03.974 --> 00:59:05.842 region:rollup2
OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:59:04.574 --> 00:59:09.246 region:rollup2

THANK YOU.

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:14.151 region:rollup2

BYSTANDERS.

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:25.762 region:rollup2
IS THERE SPECIFIC TRAINING YOU

00:59:23.527 --> 00:59:26.763 region:rollup2
GIVE TWO BYSTANDERS.

00:59:25.762 --> 00:59:30.600 region:rollup2
AND TELLING THEM WITH THEIR

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:32.636 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY IS IN REPORTING.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.938 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS TRAINING OUT THERE

00:59:32.636 --> 00:59:38.642 region:rollup2
FOR BYSTANDER REPORTING HOWEVER

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:41.344 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WEEK WE AND.

00:59:38.642 --> 00:59:43.447 region:rollup2
PRESENT TO ALL EMPLOYEES AND

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:44.915 region:rollup2
MANAGERS WHEN WE DO ANY TYPE OF

00:59:43.447 --> 00:59:46.650 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND IN BUILDING THAT

00:59:44.915 --> 00:59:48.618 region:rollup2
CULTURE THAT VOICES MATTER.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:50.787 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:54.191 region:rollup2
THIS IS AB AND ENVIRONMENT THAT

IF YOU'RE LOOKING OUT WHAT THE

SURVIVOR WANTS AND WHAT THE

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:35.752 region:rollup2

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:38.087 region:rollup2
I AND EXPRESS THAT THEY DID NOT

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:40.189 region:rollup2
WISH TO REPORT THE INCIDENT.

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:41.190 region:rollup2
.

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:43.226 region:rollup2
THE FROM A TRAUMA INFORM

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:44.961 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT DIET.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:46.563 region:rollup2
TAKING.

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:49.198 region:rollup2
THERE WHAT THEY HAVE ASKED FOR

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:50.934 region:rollup2
AND DOING OFFICE SAID WOULD READ

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:53.036 region:rollup2
COULD BE RE TRAUMATIZING.

01:07:50.934 --> 01:07:55.939 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER WAYS

01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:58.308 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE MIGHT PEOPLE TO AND

01:07:55.939 --> 01:08:00.276 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE SITUATION SO CAN NOT

01:07:58.308 --> 01:08:01.577 region:rollup2
PERSON HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:02.879 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO YOU KNOW

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:04.280 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE INCIDENT AND

01:08:02.879 --> 01:08:06.316 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.017 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANOTHER WAY THAT THEY

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:10.653 region:rollup2
COULD PERHAPS.

01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:12.922 region:rollup2
INSTILL SOMETHING THAT COULD

01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:14.824 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE SITUATION WITHOUT

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:16.225 region:rollup2
HAVING YOU KNOW THIS PERSON TOLD

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:17.994 region:rollup2

UNDER THE BUS IF YOU WILL.

01:08:21.431 --> 01:08:25.234 region:rollup2
SO I THINK DOT WHEN WHEN WE

01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:27.470 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT FROM AN ADVOCATE

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:29.138 region:rollup2

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.673 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHAT THE SURVIVOR WANTS.

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:33.309 region:rollup2
AND IF THAT MEANS THAT THEY

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:35.578 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT IT TO BE REPORTED.

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:37.146 region:rollup2
DOING SO MAY CAUSE I RETIREMENT

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:38.881 region:rollup2
HAZY XIN.

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:41.150 region:rollup2

SPEAK OUT AGAINST THAT.

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:18.388 region:rollup2
WHILE ALSO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:20.823 region:rollup2

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:10.326 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY THEY WANTED THAT

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:11.761 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THIS

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.062 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN.

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.630 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT FROM A

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:16.866 region:rollup2
SURVIVOR PERSPECTIVE THAT IS

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:23.306 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT BUT THERE IS SOME

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:24.607 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:25.641 region:rollup2
YEAH AND IT JUST REMINDS ME A

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:27.143 region:rollup2
LITTLE OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:28.711 region:rollup2
A FEW OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS

01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:30.079 region:rollup2
BUILDING WHICH IS.

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.913 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IF YOU STOCKS OF TOLD

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.148 region:rollup2
ME THAT WHEN THEY HAD FILED

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:33.883 region:rollup2

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:36.385 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WITH

FEEL. WHICH TO ME IS JUST

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:43.759 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY INSENSITIVE.

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:45.728 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD NOT MAKE ANYBODY

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:46.262 region:rollup2
WANT TO REPORT IF THAT'S THE

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:48.798 region:rollup2
WORD THAT THEY SOMEHOW ARE

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:51.267 region:rollup2

RESPOND TO THEIROWN HARASSMENT

01:12:51.267 --> 01:12:55.972 region:rollup2

MORE LEFT.

01:12:55.972 --> 01:13:00.409 region:rollup2
.

01:12:58.407 --> 01:13:05.047 region:rollup2

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:18.754 region:rollup2
AS THEIR VICTIMS HOW DO WE HELP

01:24:16.752 --> 01:24:19.955 region:rollup2
PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION SO WE CATCH

01:24:18.754 --> 01:24:21.423 region:rollup2
THINGS EARLY ENOUGH WHERE THEY

01:24:19.955 --> 01:24:23.458 region:rollup2
DON'T PROGRESS.

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:25.160 region:rollup2
TO WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF HARM.

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:26.161 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE FOUND A GENERATION

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.497 region:rollup2
THAT IS MORE READY TO SEND

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:30.232 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:31.833 region:rollup2
ARE THEY SEE SOMETHING THEY SEND

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:33.468 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND WE'VE CREATED IN

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.870 region:rollup2
THIS PLATFORM INABILITY TO

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:36.605 region:rollup2
RECEIVE SOMETHING THAT IS

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:38.774 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR

01:24:36.605 --> 01:24:39.241 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE

01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:41.510 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:43.245 region:rollup2
ON.

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:45.347 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN ONLINE IS

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:46.915 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS

01:24:45.347 --> 01:24:48.684 region:rollup2
SO PEOPLE DO NOT FEEL ALONE BUT

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:50.252 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO

01:24:48.684 --> 01:24:52.187 region:rollup2
NOT KNOW HOW TO CONNECT.

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:53.755 region:rollup2
AND WE UNDERSTAND THESE PATHWAYS

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:55.691 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO PREVENT THINGS AND

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:57.259 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MAIN PATHWAYS.

01:24:55.691 --> 01:24:58.760 region:rollup2
IS THE PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL

01:24:57.259 --> 01:24:59.861 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MANY OF THESE EVENTS

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.897 region:rollup2
TAKE PLACE WHEN PEOPLE ARE

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:03.665 region:rollup2
INTOXICATED SO WE REALLY NEED TO

01:25:01.897 --> 01:25:06.735 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW THESE THINGS

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:08.637 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AND HAD RESPOND. AND.

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:09.972 region:rollup2
FOR ARM EVERYONE

01:25:08.637 --> 01:25:12.074 region:rollup2
SO THEREFORE WARNED AND WE AVOID

01:25:09.972 --> 01:25:12.574 region:rollup2
THESE TYPES OF EVENTS.

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:14.443 region:rollup2
SO.

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:16.578 region:rollup2
BRIDGET HAS SUBJECT MATTER

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:18.647 region:rollup2
EXPERTS LIKE MYSELF IN ORDER TO

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:20.649 region:rollup2
SAY WHAT ARE THE PATHWAYS

01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:22.918 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE DO ASSESSMENTS HOW

01:25:20.649 --> 01:25:24.586 region:rollup2
CAN WE COLLECT DATA HOW COULD WE

01:25:22.918 --> 01:25:26.221 region:rollup2
RESPOND IN REAL TIME WHERE

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:28.790 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FEEL SUPPORTED. AND WHAT

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:29.324 region:rollup2
INFORMATION CAN WE PROVIDE THEM

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.959 region:rollup2
THE THREE ABLE TO MAKE IT

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:32.461 region:rollup2
THROUGH THESE EVENTS.

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:34.196 region:rollup2
MADAM CHAIR MISTER IRVING BEFORE

OUR AGENDA TODAY THAT WOULD BE

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:50.412 region:rollup2
VERY HELPFUL FOR OUR PROCESS.

01:25:47.009 --> 01:25:51.980 region:rollup2

SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THE

01:25:57.753 --> 01:26:00.389 region:rollup2
AREAS OF.

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:03.725 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGY.

01:26:00.389 --> 01:26:04.192 region:rollup2
TITLE NINE.

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:04.659 region:rollup2
FIRST AMENDMENT FOURTH

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:06.328 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT.

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:08.530 region:rollup2
.

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:11.099 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS EDUCATORS PARENTS

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:12.701 region:rollup2
TEACHERS AND THE LIKE AND WE

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:14.336 region:rollup2

IN CALIFORNIA.

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:21.576 region:rollup2
AND AS EVERYONE THING THAT'S

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:22.811 region:rollup2
BEEN SAID BEFORE IT'S ALL TRUE.

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:24.246 region:rollup2
ITS ABOUT ALL THE SEAS IT'S

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:25.947 region:rollup2
ABOUT TRUST IT'S ABOUT

01:26:24.246 --> 01:26:26.381 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING.

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:28.050 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT

01:26:26.381 --> 01:26:30.118 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:32.254 region:rollup2
AND SO AS WE BACK UP AND WE LOOK

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:33.021 region:rollup2
AT WHY HAS CULTURE CHANGE SO

01:26:32.254 --> 01:26:35.223 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST TEN

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:36.291 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:37.359 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS BEEN IN THE LAST TEN

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:38.226 region:rollup2
YEARS AND IT'S BECAUSE

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:39.995 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION HAS CHANGED

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:40.862 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY.

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:42.431 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT CHANGE

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:44.533 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION.

01:26:42.431 --> 01:26:47.302 region:rollup2
THE CULTURAL CHANGE CAME.

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:48.570 region:rollup2
WE A BRIDGET AND SAFE CAMPUS ON

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:50.372 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THEY WERE DOING ITS

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:52.340 region:rollup2
ALL AROUND HARNESSING THAT SAME

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:55.010 region:rollup2
SOCIAL TECHNOLOGY THAT SAME PUSH

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.712 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY. THAT SAME IMMEDIATE

01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:57.345 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK LOOP.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:59.014 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO CREATE DIGITAL PEER

01:26:57.345 --> 01:27:00.549 region:rollup2
PRESSURE.

01:26:59.014 --> 01:27:01.950 region:rollup2
TO CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:03.585 region:rollup2
CREATE POSITIVELY IN A RESTORED

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:05.253 region:rollup2
OF ENVIRONMENT.

01:27:03.585 --> 01:27:07.122 region:rollup2
WHITE NOW WE ARE ALL OVER RUN

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:08.557 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY.

01:27:07.122 --> 01:27:10.158 region:rollup2
BY THE IMMEDIATE POST THERE'S NO

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:12.127 region:rollup2
TIME TO REACT.

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:15.230 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO TIME TO CORRECT

01:27:12.127 --> 01:27:16.531 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SHAMING IS NOW THE NORM.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:17.899 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT'S GETS POSTED

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:19.735 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT TRUE AND OR HURTFUL

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:21.570 region:rollup2
OR HARMFUL.

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:23.338 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF PERSPECTIVE IS

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:26.208 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SHAMING AND IS THE MOST

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:28.410 region:rollup2
DIVISIVE TOOL HUMAN BEING HAS.

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:29.711 region:rollup2
SO WE COME AT THIS.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:32.347 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM AND ITS GLOBAL

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:34.249 region:rollup2
PROBLEM A IN EVERY CULTURE

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:36.318 region:rollup2
CUTTING ACROSS EVERY RACE.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:37.786 region:rollup2
EVERY EVERY TYPE. YOU KNOW IT

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:39.154 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S HAS THE SAME PROBLEM

01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:41.857 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:43.658 region:rollup2
SO THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO.

01:27:41.857 --> 01:27:45.761 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE CULTURE AND IT'S IT'S

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:46.261 region:rollup2
ABOUT LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP.

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:47.529 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:49.464 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP.

01:27:47.529 --> 01:27:51.666 region:rollup2
TAPPING THE STUDENTS

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:53.702 region:rollup2
OR THE MEMBERS.

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:55.537 region:rollup2
OR THE LOBBYISTS OR THE BUS

01:27:53.702 --> 01:27:57.339 region:rollup2
DRIVERS OR THE PARENTS AND

01:27:55.537 --> 01:27:59.007 region:rollup2
EMPOWERING THEM.

01:27:57.339 --> 01:28:00.575 region:rollup2
TO SET THE STANDARDS THAT YOU

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:02.878 region:rollup2
WANT IN TERMS OF CULTURE TO

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:05.380 region:rollup2
OPTIMIZE CULTURE VARIES IS SAY

01:28:02.878 --> 01:28:06.681 region:rollup2
THESE WORDS VERY HARD TO DO.

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.182 region:rollup2
OUR PLATFORMS ARE BUILT ON THE

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:09.417 region:rollup2
RESEARCH OF DR DOROTHEA

01:28:07.182 --> 01:28:10.352 region:rollup2
SUPPLIES.

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:11.620 region:rollup2
SHE IS THE LEADING RESEARCHER

01:28:10.352 --> 01:28:13.855 region:rollup2
AND OWLING HUSSMAN SEXUAL

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:15.023 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IN THE COUNTRY OF THE

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:15.991 region:rollup2
LAST TWENTY TWO YEARS TO HOUSE.

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:17.192 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:28:15.991 --> 01:28:20.095 region:rollup2
ILLINOIS FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS

01:28:17.192 --> 01:28:20.962 region:rollup2
NOW SHE WORKS OUT OF FLORIDA.

01:28:20.095 --> 01:28:23.465 region:rollup2
BUT HER.

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:26.001 region:rollup2
WHOLE.

01:28:23.465 --> 01:28:27.669 region:rollup2
RESEARCH WAS BASED ON HOW DO YOU

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:29.371 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU CREATE MORE POSITIVE

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:31.540 region:rollup2
SCHOOL CLIMATE RIGHT. AND YOU

01:28:29.371 --> 01:28:33.141 region:rollup2
CAN ONLY DO THAT BY ALIGNING.

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.675 region:rollup2
THE PARENT AND TEACHER IN THE

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.477 region:rollup2
CHARACTER EDUCATION OF THE

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:37.679 region:rollup2
STUDENT.

01:28:35.477 --> 01:28:38.513 region:rollup2
SAME APPLIES TO ANY CAMPUS AT

01:28:37.679 --> 01:28:40.415 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGE LEVEL OR TO ANY

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:42.150 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:44.085 region:rollup2
SO IT'S ABOUT SETTING STANDARDS

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:46.254 region:rollup2
AND TO VININGS TO FINDING.

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:47.856 region:rollup2
TO THAT END AS WE LOOK AT SEXUAL

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:50.058 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON

01:28:47.856 --> 01:28:51.493 region:rollup2
HERE TODAY. AND I'VE PARTNERED

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:52.894 region:rollup2
WITH THE WE SAID ENOUGH.

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:54.829 region:rollup2
.

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:56.331 region:rollup2
GROUP OUT OF OUT OF SACRAMENTO

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:57.632 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN VIA HAVE A

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:59.367 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH ME AND I'VE

01:28:57.632 --> 01:29:01.169 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING SCHOOLS ON PRIVACY.

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:04.039 region:rollup2
AND ISSUES ALONG THOSE AND. BUT

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:06.875 region:rollup2
AS WE FOCUS ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

01:29:04.039 --> 01:29:08.510 region:rollup2
AND SOCIAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT YOU

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:11.012 region:rollup2
HAVE TO START BUTTON FINDING IT.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:12.914 region:rollup2
AND AND MAKING IT EASY TO DEFINE

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:14.449 region:rollup2
AND AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:16.251 region:rollup2
AND SO AS WE PUT TOGETHER OUR

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:18.920 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WE WANTED TO DO THAT ON

01:29:16.251 --> 01:29:19.955 region:rollup2
BOTH A VISUAL BASIS WITH ICONS.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:21.423 region:rollup2
THAT A NON THREATENING AND ON

01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:22.724 region:rollup2
TRIGGERING.

01:29:21.423 --> 01:29:24.926 region:rollup2
AND BUT ALSO WITH DEFINITIONS

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:25.694 region:rollup2
THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE ACROSS

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:28.530 region:rollup2
ALL THE VARIOUS GROUPS THAT ARE

01:29:25.694 --> 01:29:30.098 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:31.766 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT WE REALIZED

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:32.834 region:rollup2
AS WE LAUNCH THESE PLATFORMS IN

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:34.569 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AROUND THE

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:38.240 region:rollup2
COUNTRY IS THAT. YOU WANT THE

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:39.174 region:rollup2
DETERRENT YOU WANT PREVENTION.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.842 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES HAVE ALWAYS SET

01:29:39.174 --> 01:29:42.210 region:rollup2
STANDARDS ON A FACE TO FACE

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:43.545 region:rollup2
BASIS AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.945 region:rollup2
INTERPERSONAL LOOKED EACH OTHER

01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:45.046 region:rollup2
IN THE EYE AND HAD

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:47.282 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:48.817 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE PHONE CAME ALONG RIGHT

01:29:47.282 --> 01:29:50.385 region:rollup2
NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK PEOPLE

01:29:48.817 --> 01:29:52.020 region:rollup2
IN THE I MEAN JUST PRESS THE

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:53.288 region:rollup2
BUTTON HITS AND THEN MAYBE THEY

01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.789 region:rollup2
GOT IT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T MAYBE

01:29:53.288 --> 01:29:56.291 region:rollup2
THEY INTERPRETED CORRECTLY. OR

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:58.059 region:rollup2
MAYBE THE HOT.

01:29:56.291 --> 01:29:59.761 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU CAN TAKE THAT'S IF

01:29:58.059 --> 01:30:01.896 region:rollup2
YOU REALIZE THAT.

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:03.832 region:rollup2
DIGITAL PEER PRESSURE IS NOW

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:05.133 region:rollup2
ACHIEVABLE RIGHT FACE TO FACE

01:30:03.832 --> 01:30:06.701 region:rollup2
PEER PRESSURE IS ALWAYS BEEN

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:08.136 region:rollup2
ACHIEVABLE FOR IN THIS ROOM WERE

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:09.738 region:rollup2
ALL GOING TO ACT A CERTAIN WAY.

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:10.939 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU CAN CREATE DIGITAL

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:13.174 region:rollup2
PEER PRESSURE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:30:10.939 --> 01:30:14.242 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY.

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:15.810 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN THINGS

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:17.312 region:rollup2
START TO GET BETTER.

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:19.381 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CHANGE THE RISK

01:30:17.312 --> 01:30:21.549 region:rollup2
REWARD AROUND THE BAD BEHAVIOR

01:30:19.381 --> 01:30:23.518 region:rollup2
YOU'VE CHANGED YOU BROUGHT THEM

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:25.954 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE ANONYMOUS STARK INTO

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:27.088 region:rollup2
THE LIGHT. AND IN DOING THAT YOU

01:30:25.954 --> 01:30:29.124 region:rollup2
NOW START TO HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:30.759 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

01:30:29.124 --> 01:30:32.360 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT WE CAN

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:34.129 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FROM IN TERMS OF MOBILE

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:36.031 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS DATA.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:37.399 region:rollup2
AYE MEAN DATA WORKS WE WILL USE

01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:39.000 region:rollup2
IN SO MANY POSITIVE WAYS RIGHT

01:30:37.399 --> 01:30:40.035 region:rollup2
NOW AROUND THE WORLD.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.670 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO IT AROUND SEXUAL

01:30:40.035 --> 01:30:43.471 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT ABUSE BOWLING

01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:45.173 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:46.875 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN DO IT BY STARTING

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:49.010 region:rollup2
GATHERS DATA HAD A TIME AND

01:30:46.875 --> 01:30:50.111 region:rollup2
OFTEN. AND IF YOU CAN GATHER

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:51.780 region:rollup2
THAT DATA YOU CAN START TO SEE

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:53.615 region:rollup2
TRAIN TRENDS AND AS YOU START TO

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.350 region:rollup2
SEE TRENDS YOU CAN BECOME

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:56.952 region:rollup2
PROGRESS PREDICTIVE.

01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:58.453 region:rollup2
AND THAT ALLOWS LEADERSHIP TO

01:30:56.952 --> 01:31:01.122 region:rollup2
SET POLICY AND DIRECT LIMITED

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:02.190 region:rollup2
RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY.

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.792 region:rollup2
I LOOK AT THE WORLD AS

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:05.660 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THE TRANSACTION I

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:07.062 region:rollup2
LOOK AT YOU I SMILE YOU SMILE

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:08.096 region:rollup2
BACK AT THE POSITIVE TRANSACTION

01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:09.364 region:rollup2
I LOOK AT YOU YOU DON'T SMILE

01:31:08.096 --> 01:31:11.099 region:rollup2
BACK. THAT'S A NEUTRAL OR

01:31:09.364 --> 01:31:11.933 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE.

01:31:11.099 --> 01:31:13.501 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO THE NUMBER

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:15.403 region:rollup2
TRANSACTIONS ON A BEHAVIORAL

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:16.638 region:rollup2
LEVEL THAT GO ON EVERYDAY THAT

01:31:15.403 --> 01:31:18.707 region:rollup2
CAN BE CONSTRUED AND OR

01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:20.809 region:rollup2
MISCONSTRUED. PHENOMENAL NUMBERS

01:31:18.707 --> 01:31:21.810 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:23.645 region:rollup2
GENERALLY MANAGE FROM THE TOP

01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:25.113 region:rollup2
DOWN STRATEGY BUT IT IS

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:26.247 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WORK CAN BE FROM A

01:31:25.113 --> 01:31:27.248 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WIDE.

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:29.617 region:rollup2
STANDARD WHERE EVERYONE'S

01:31:27.248 --> 01:31:31.252 region:rollup2
WATCHING EACH OTHER'S BACK.

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:32.587 region:rollup2
SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:34.589 region:rollup2
SPENT A LOT OF TIME.

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:35.623 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH VARIOUS ALL THE

TO PUT TOGETHER A PLATFORM THAT

01:31:43.298 --> 01:31:45.800 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY COULD WORKED EVERYONE'S

01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:48.370 region:rollup2

THREE OR FOUR WEEKS.

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:59.014 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS DESIGNED TO GATHER

01:31:57.645 --> 01:32:02.117 region:rollup2
DATA.

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:04.452 region:rollup2
NOT POINT A FINGER TO DEBT BUT

01:32:02.117 --> 01:32:06.287 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE METRICS AND THE

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:07.322 region:rollup2
THE EXPANSIVENESS OF THE PROBLEM

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:09.124 region:rollup2
AS IT RELATES NOT ONLY

01:32:07.322 --> 01:32:10.725 region:rollup2

THOSE POLICIES THEY GET THEM

THEY READ THEM AND THEN THEY

01:39:28.162 --> 01:39:30.398 region:rollup2
TOSS THEM ASIDE.

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:32.200 region:rollup2

POLICIES PEOPLE WOULDN'T LOSE

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:39.440 region:rollup2
THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBERS

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:41.976 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WOULDN'T.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.711 region:rollup2
SAY THEY COULDN'T GET A HOLD OF

THERE TO HELP THEM.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.250 region:rollup2
SO ONE DAY OUT OF FRUSTRATION

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:51.419 region:rollup2
AFTER LISTENING TO PEOPLE

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:53.421 region:rollup2
TESTIFY OVER AND OVER IN A LARGE

01:39:51.419 --> 01:39:54.522 region:rollup2
CLASS ACTION I WAS INVOLVED IN.

01:39:53.421 --> 01:39:55.890 region:rollup2

NUMBERS AND THOSE HOTLINE

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:03.531 region:rollup2
NUMBERS

01:40:01.896 --> 01:40:05.800 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE

01:40:03.531 --> 01:40:08.603 region:rollup2
NEVER LOSE THESE DAYS.

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:09.237 region:rollup2
THEIR PHONES THERE ARE PHONES.

01:40:08.603 --> 01:40:10.771 region:rollup2
SO THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE TO COME

01:40:09.237 --> 01:40:12.206 region:rollup2
UP WITH NOW.

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:13.307 region:rollup2
AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:15.776 region:rollup2
PEOPLE PRETTY MUCH THESE DAYS.

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:16.944 region:rollup2
TO LOSE SOMETHING.

01:40:15.776 --> 01:40:19.046 region:rollup2
SO A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:20.615 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA.

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:22.083 region:rollup2
AND WE STARTED THE DEVELOPMENT.

01:40:20.615 --> 01:40:24.085 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IS NOW CANDOR.

01:40:22.083 --> 01:40:25.419 region:rollup2
AND.

01:40:24.085 --> 01:40:27.188 region:rollup2
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING

01:40:25.419 --> 01:40:28.856 region:rollup2
THAT ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS

01:40:27.188 --> 01:40:30.758 region:rollup2
SAID TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:32.760 region:rollup2
OF TRAINING.

01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:33.995 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF OF WORKING

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.396 region:rollup2
WITH VICTIMS OF THE IMPORTANCE

01:40:33.995 --> 01:40:36.530 region:rollup2
WAS CREATING A CULTURE OF

01:40:35.396 --> 01:40:39.033 region:rollup2
RESPECT BECAUSE. I DO ALL THOSE

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:40.501 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:42.203 region:rollup2
I WORK WITH MANAGERS I TRAIN.

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:43.804 region:rollup2
MANAGERS I TRAINED STAFF I HAVE

01:40:42.203 --> 01:40:45.573 region:rollup2
SPENT MORE TIME IN THE LAST FEW

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:46.207 region:rollup2
MONTHS BY THE WAY TRAINING STAFF

01:40:45.573 --> 01:40:47.508 region:rollup2
AND MANAGERS THAT I WANT TO TELL

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:48.109 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:49.777 region:rollup2
I COULD PROBABLY DO THIS FULL

01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:51.445 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:52.914 region:rollup2
AND BODY WEIGHT BIG SUPPORTER

01:40:51.445 --> 01:40:54.315 region:rollup2
OF AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE TWO

01:40:52.914 --> 01:40:55.950 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE CHANGES OVER THE

01:40:54.315 --> 01:40:56.918 region:rollup2
LAST FEW YEARS.

01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:57.585 region:rollup2
ARE BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S

01:40:56.918 --> 01:40:59.053 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO GO IN THE

01:40:57.585 --> 01:41:01.122 region:rollup2
WORKPLACES AND WORK WITH

01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:03.457 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS AND DO

01:41:01.122 --> 01:41:06.994 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:08.963 region:rollup2
I SEE OUR APT IS ONLY AN ADDED.

01:41:06.994 --> 01:41:11.399 region:rollup2
PART OF ALL OF THAT.

01:41:08.963 --> 01:41:12.967 region:rollup2
BUT ONE THING WE DO BRING TO THE

OF COURSE THE BE A CUSTOMIZED

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:13.360 region:rollup2
MESSAGE THAT SENT BY THEM.

01:47:11.125 --> 01:47:20.768 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY EMPLOYER.

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:22.736 region:rollup2
GETS PINK IMMEDIATELY.

01:47:20.768 --> 01:47:24.305 region:rollup2
NOW I CAN SEND PHOTOS AS WELL.

01:47:22.736 --> 01:47:27.675 region:rollup2
OR VIDEOS.

01:47:24.305 --> 01:47:29.143 region:rollup2
IF THEY NEED TO.

01:47:27.675 --> 01:47:30.744 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THE

01:47:29.143 --> 01:47:31.645 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THOSE ARE THOSE ARE.

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:33.113 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO ATTACH

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:34.982 region:rollup2
IT TO SEND.

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:35.549 region:rollup2
THEY MAY BE PIECES OF EVIDENCE

01:47:34.982 --> 01:47:36.650 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE THINGS THAT THEY

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:39.253 region:rollup2
WANT US TO SEE.

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:46.093 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE.

01:47:39.253 --> 01:47:47.361 region:rollup2
SO I CAN GET ATTACHED.

01:47:46.093 --> 01:47:49.263 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE CITY THE INBOX AT

01:47:47.361 --> 01:47:50.431 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEE WOULD HAVE THAT

01:47:49.263 --> 01:47:52.232 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THEIR MESSAGES AS

01:47:50.431 --> 01:47:54.268 region:rollup2
WELL. ORGANIZED.

01:47:52.232 --> 01:47:56.070 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A COPY OF

01:47:54.268 --> 01:47:58.205 region:rollup2
HANDLE POLICIES SO THE EMPLOYER

01:47:56.070 --> 01:48:00.140 region:rollup2
HAS HIM A POLICIES OR FORMS OR

01:47:58.205 --> 01:48:02.242 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT THEY WANT ON THE.

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:03.544 region:rollup2
I MEAN OF PHONE.

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:05.179 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE A COPY SO THAT WE

01:48:03.544 --> 01:48:06.480 region:rollup2
ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SO

01:48:05.179 --> 01:48:08.382 region:rollup2
THEIR RESOURCES ARE ALWAYS THERE

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:09.016 region:rollup2
AND HAD ANY ORGANIZATIONAL MAN

01:48:08.382 --> 01:48:10.284 region:rollup2
IN THAT THE EMPLOYER WANTS THEM

01:48:09.016 --> 01:48:11.585 region:rollup2
TO SEE THEM.

01:48:10.284 --> 01:48:12.586 region:rollup2
AGAIN BECAUSE I GET FRUSTRATED

01:48:11.585 --> 01:48:14.088 region:rollup2
THAT NOBODY EVER KEEP COPIES OF

01:48:12.586 --> 01:48:15.389 region:rollup2
THEIR HANDS.

01:48:14.088 --> 01:48:18.459 region:rollup2
THAT WE WORK SO HARD TO WRITE.

01:48:15.389 --> 01:48:18.625 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY ARE AS WELL.

01:48:18.459 --> 01:48:19.994 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:21.962 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:48:19.994 --> 01:48:27.601 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THAT.

01:48:21.962 --> 01:48:30.137 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE A COPY OF.

01:48:27.601 --> 01:48:31.839 region:rollup2
WHAT BR SORRY WITH THE WHAT?

01:48:30.137 --> 01:48:33.574 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER DASHBOARD WOULD LOOK

01:48:31.839 --> 01:48:34.475 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:48:33.574 --> 01:48:36.543 region:rollup2
SO THE EMPLOYER DASH FOR HIS

01:48:34.475 --> 01:48:38.345 region:rollup2
ENTIRE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

01:48:36.543 --> 01:48:39.780 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHICH IS. ALL THE

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:41.315 region:rollup2
MESSAGES THAT ARE CAPPED

01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:44.051 region:rollup2
AND THE CAN BE ORGANIZED AND

01:48:41.315 --> 01:48:46.253 region:rollup2
FILED BY BY THE EMPLOYER. THEY

01:48:44.051 --> 01:48:46.820 region:rollup2
CAN MEET TAD SO THEY CAN BE.

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:49.056 region:rollup2
NORMALLY WE HAVE A WHOLE DEL

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:50.624 region:rollup2
MURPHY THE YOU CAN MEET HAD THEM

01:48:49.056 --> 01:48:52.059 region:rollup2
COLOR CODING SEARCHABLE.

01:48:50.624 --> 01:48:53.727 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE NOW AS

01:48:52.059 --> 01:48:55.629 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING VERSION TWO IS YOU

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:57.664 region:rollup2
CAN KEEP NOTES.

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:59.066 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SHARE THE NOTES

01:48:57.664 --> 01:49:00.634 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN KEEP NOTES ALONG SIDE

01:48:59.066 --> 01:49:02.169 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE TIME IN REAL TIME CITY

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:03.971 region:rollup2
MAKE NOTES ALONGSIDE AND THEN

01:49:02.169 --> 01:49:05.472 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ALSO HAVE THE OTHER

01:49:03.971 --> 01:49:07.207 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS.

01:49:05.472 --> 01:49:08.208 region:rollup2
IT ALSO SHARE NOTES AMONGST

01:49:07.207 --> 01:49:09.877 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES THEN OF COURSE YOU

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:11.311 region:rollup2
CAN EXPORT ALL OF THAT IF YOU

01:49:09.877 --> 01:49:13.180 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOUR

01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:14.782 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY. HAVE ACCESS TO ALL

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:15.315 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:49:14.782 --> 01:49:18.786 region:rollup2
SO BECOME THE ENTIRE CASE

01:49:15.315 --> 01:49:21.655 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT SAYS.

01:49:18.786 --> 01:49:23.824 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN WE DON'T EXPECT THAT.

01:49:21.655 --> 01:49:26.427 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATING BY AN APP IS GOOD

01:49:23.824 --> 01:49:27.895 region:rollup2
EVER REPLACE HUMAN INTERACTION I

01:49:26.427 --> 01:49:29.363 region:rollup2
WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS IS

01:49:27.895 --> 01:49:31.298 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A FIRST

01:49:29.363 --> 01:49:32.733 region:rollup2
STEP IN AN INVESTIGATION.

01:49:31.298 --> 01:49:33.734 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE WOULD HOPE THAT

01:49:32.733 --> 01:49:35.602 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WOULD COMMENT ON HAVE A

01:49:33.734 --> 01:49:37.204 region:rollup2
LIVE INTERACTION. BUT THERE MAY

01:49:35.602 --> 01:49:39.606 region:rollup2
BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE

01:49:37.204 --> 01:49:40.841 region:rollup2
NEVER REVEAL THEMSELVES AND THEN

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:42.943 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE. NO

01:49:40.841 --> 01:49:44.044 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION AND THIS OBVIOUSLY

01:49:42.943 --> 01:49:45.979 region:rollup2
THEN YOU COULD HAVE OTHER

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:47.448 region:rollup2
WITNESSES AND THINGS THAT ARE

01:49:45.979 --> 01:49:49.249 region:rollup2
PART OF AN INVESTIGATION.

01:49:47.448 --> 01:49:51.718 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE AN INTERESTING.

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:53.487 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PART OF OUR OF OUR.

01:49:51.718 --> 01:49:55.289 region:rollup2
METRICS TO LOOK AND SEE HOW WE

01:49:53.487 --> 01:49:56.090 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THE

01:49:55.289 --> 01:49:57.891 region:rollup2
CLAIMS THAT REMAIN ANONYMOUS

01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:59.426 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS AND TIME THAT SOMETHING

01:49:57.891 --> 01:50:00.394 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T.

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:01.495 region:rollup2
HOW A LOT OF AL AND LOT OF

01:50:00.394 --> 01:50:02.729 region:rollup2
INTERACTION WITH BUT WILL LEARN

01:50:01.495 --> 01:50:04.465 region:rollup2
AS WE GO UP?

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:06.433 region:rollup2
BUT ONE THING WE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:50:04.465 --> 01:50:08.001 region:rollup2
DO IS INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO

01:50:06.433 --> 01:50:09.703 region:rollup2
GET INFORMATION AND HOPEFULLY

01:50:08.001 --> 01:50:12.039 region:rollup2
INCREASE PEOPLE COMING FORWARD

01:50:09.703 --> 01:50:13.941 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE DON'T LOOK AT. ONE IN

01:50:12.039 --> 01:50:15.275 region:rollup2
FOUR PEOPLE COMING FORWARD.

01:50:13.941 --> 01:50:17.211 region:rollup2
IN THESE RASKIN CLAIMS WILL

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:18.412 region:rollup2
INCREASE THIS TO MAYBE TWO WEARS

01:50:17.211 --> 01:50:19.780 region:rollup2
THREE OUT OF FOUR PEOPLE COMING

01:50:18.412 --> 01:50:20.881 region:rollup2
FORWARD. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:22.182 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

01:50:20.881 --> 01:50:23.517 region:rollup2
I WHAT WE WILL BE DOING DOWN THE

01:50:22.182 --> 01:50:25.652 region:rollup2
LINE AND WELL AS BEING ABLE TO

01:50:23.517 --> 01:50:27.921 region:rollup2

MEASURE METRICS AS WELL.

01:50:34.228 --> 01:50:37.798 region:rollup2

WHICH WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS AND

01:52:17.331 --> 01:52:22.069 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THAT ENCOMPASSES SOCIAL

THEY'RE ALL TYPES OF ACTS THAT

ARE GOING AROUND SO WE ENCOURAGE

01:54:49.816 --> 01:54:53.086 region:rollup2
OUR STUDENTS TO USE WHAT WORKS

01:54:50.817 --> 01:54:54.554 region:rollup2
FOR THEM THEIR CONSENT APPS.

01:54:53.086 --> 01:54:55.789 region:rollup2
THREE OF THE ONES THAT WE HAVE

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:57.090 region:rollup2
PURSUED USER WE CONSENT IF

01:54:55.789 --> 01:54:59.159 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT

01:54:57.090 --> 01:55:01.661 region:rollup2
TO USE THERE'S ALSO LEGAL FLING

01:54:59.159 --> 01:55:02.195 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A NEW APP AS WELL. BUT

01:55:01.661 --> 01:55:03.029 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THAT'S A VERY

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:05.065 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC.

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:06.500 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING GOING

01:55:05.065 --> 01:55:07.667 region:rollup2

VIA THAT OUT BUT THEN I CAN GET

01:55:07.667 --> 01:55:11.071 region:rollup2
IN THAT ROOM AND I DEFTLY

01:55:08.869 --> 01:55:12.205 region:rollup2
CHANGED MY MIND.

01:55:11.071 --> 01:55:13.240 region:rollup2
I'M SO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:14.875 region:rollup2

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:16.176 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE USING TENDER

01:55:14.875 --> 01:55:17.744 region:rollup2
THEY'RE USING SALSA PLEASING.

01:55:16.176 --> 01:55:19.780 region:rollup2
MEDIA'S UPDATING SOCIAL ONLINE

01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:21.148 region:rollup2
IS A DATING SO HEY'RE ALSO NINE

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:22.883 region:rollup2
TIMES OUT OF TEN GOING TO USE

01:55:21.148 --> 01:55:23.950 region:rollup2
OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA FOR REPORTING

01:55:22.883 --> 01:55:25.318 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:26.853 region:rollup2
SO THE ISSUE WE KNOW THIS

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:28.789 region:rollup2
ALREADY THAT ONE IN FIVE CALLS

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:30.724 region:rollup2
WOMEN ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ONE

01:55:28.789 --> 01:55:32.225 region:rollup2

SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON COLLEGE

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:38.365 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:39.599 region:rollup2
IN YOUR DEPARTMENTS HERE JUST

01:55:38.365 --> 01:55:40.834 region:rollup2
THINKING OF THAT PROBABLY

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:42.135 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO WORKING YOUR

01:55:40.834 --> 01:55:43.537 region:rollup2
WORKPLACES HAPPENED SEXUALLY

01:55:43.537 --> 01:55:46.072 region:rollup2
TYPE OF INCIDENTS.

01:55:44.571 --> 01:55:47.674 region:rollup2
AND SO KNOWING THAT IN DIFFERENT

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:50.076 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS THE TRIGGERS THAT

01:55:47.674 --> 01:55:52.045 region:rollup2
OCCUR COMMENTS THAT ARE SAD THAT

01:55:50.076 --> 01:55:57.017 region:rollup2
ARE HARASSMENT TO MANY PEOPLE

01:55:52.045 --> 01:55:57.617 region:rollup2
ARE THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL THE

01:55:57.017 --> 01:55:58.218 region:rollup2
FOR SOMEBODY WHO MAY HAVE BEEN

01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:58.785 region:rollup2
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IN THEIR.

01:55:58.218 --> 01:55:59.386 region:rollup2
TIME PRIOR IN THEIR COLLEGE

01:55:58.785 --> 01:55:59.820 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

01:55:59.386 --> 01:56:00.353 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:02.389 region:rollup2
I WOULD SO THAT'S REALLY

01:56:00.353 --> 01:56:03.490 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS WE TRANSITION OF

01:56:02.389 --> 01:56:04.724 region:rollup2
OUR STUDENTS WE ALSO YOUR CHANCE

01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:05.759 region:rollup2
YOU WILL YOU'RE GONNA GO

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:07.394 region:rollup2
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

01:56:05.759 --> 01:56:08.128 region:rollup2
BUT HOW DO WE HOW ARE WE HAVING

01:56:07.394 --> 01:56:09.396 region:rollup2
THOSE CARS USE HOW REALLY

01:56:08.128 --> 01:56:10.764 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE CULTURE NOT JUST ON

01:56:09.396 --> 01:56:12.799 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CAMPUSES BUT IT WORK

01:56:10.764 --> 01:56:14.034 region:rollup2
PLACES AS WELL.

01:56:12.799 --> 01:56:15.302 region:rollup2
SO WHY DON'T PEOPLE REPORT WE'VE

01:56:14.034 --> 01:56:16.670 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THIS IN HER IS IN

01:56:15.302 --> 01:56:18.305 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PANEL THEY DON'T THINK

01:56:16.670 --> 01:56:19.339 region:rollup2
IT'S SERIOUS.

01:56:18.305 --> 01:56:20.740 region:rollup2
THEY MAY HAVE A CRIMINAL PLOT

01:56:19.339 --> 01:56:22.008 region:rollup2
PASSED

01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:23.710 region:rollup2
MANY OF OUR STUDENTS MAYBE.

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:25.545 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATS SEEM TO BE COMING

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:26.580 region:rollup2
FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. UP WE

01:56:25.545 --> 01:56:27.747 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL

01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:29.049 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:30.517 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO IN THERE ISN'T

01:56:29.049 --> 01:56:32.118 region:rollup2
THERE SOME CONCERN ABOUT THAT IF

01:56:30.517 --> 01:56:33.220 region:rollup2
I REPORT THIS.

01:56:32.118 --> 01:56:34.588 region:rollup2
BUT IS IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE NOT

01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:35.889 region:rollup2
JUST FOR ME. BUT FOR THE OTHER

01:56:34.588 --> 01:56:36.823 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL.

01:56:35.889 --> 01:56:38.325 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT NINETY

01:56:36.823 --> 01:56:39.993 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF ASSAULTS ARE

01:56:38.325 --> 01:56:43.096 region:rollup2
COMMITTED BY.

01:56:39.993 --> 01:56:44.164 region:rollup2
PERPETRATORS ARE CONTINUOUS.

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:45.732 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S AN ISSUE ON A COLLEGE

01:56:44.164 --> 01:56:47.033 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

01:56:45.732 --> 01:56:49.336 region:rollup2

SYSTEM SO IT'S AN OPT OUT

02:04:43.242 --> 02:04:47.714 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:04:45.445 --> 02:04:49.615 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT OPTING IN

02:04:47.714 --> 02:04:51.451 region:rollup2
IS REALLY HARD TO DO RIGHT NO I

02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:52.852 region:rollup2

PERPETRATORS NAME IS LISTED IN

02:04:54.654 --> 02:04:57.857 region:rollup2
THERE THEN IT HAS TO BE FOLLOWED

02:04:56.489 --> 02:04:59.859 region:rollup2
UP WITH AN A PROCESS THAT HAD

02:04:57.857 --> 02:05:01.194 region:rollup2
HAS TO GO ON THAT GOES ON WITHIN

02:04:59.859 --> 02:05:04.030 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE IN THE COMPANY.

02:05:01.194 --> 02:05:05.331 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE COMPANY OR WITHIN THE

SCHOOL AND IS ANY OF THAT MADE.

02:05:05.331 --> 02:05:08.267 region:rollup2
COULD NOT BE PUBLICLY SEEN MANY

02:05:06.566 --> 02:05:10.303 region:rollup2
OF THESE APPLICATION.

02:05:08.267 --> 02:05:11.604 region:rollup2
AND NOW IT'S ALL CLOSED ALL THE

02:05:10.303 --> 02:05:12.939 region:rollup2
MODERATORS WHO RECEIVE THE

02:05:11.604 --> 02:05:14.674 region:rollup2
REPORTS ARE TRAINED AND WHAT THE

02:05:12.939 --> 02:05:16.943 region:rollup2
LAW IS FEDERALLY ON A STATE

02:05:14.674 --> 02:05:18.077 region:rollup2
LEVEL TITLE NINE TOTAL SEVEN.

02:05:16.943 --> 02:05:19.212 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE WHISTLEBLOWER LAWS

02:05:18.077 --> 02:05:21.414 region:rollup2
ARE IN EVERY STATE BECAUSE

02:05:19.212 --> 02:05:23.149 region:rollup2
IDENTITY THREAT IS THE BIGGEST

02:05:21.414 --> 02:05:25.051 region:rollup2
THREAT THAT WE ALL FACE TODAY.

02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:26.119 region:rollup2
SO UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE

02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:27.720 region:rollup2
TO DO.

02:05:26.119 --> 02:05:30.289 region:rollup2
AND INVESTIGATION THAT IT'S

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:31.657 region:rollup2
SAFE AND NON THREATENING.

02:05:30.289 --> 02:05:34.193 region:rollup2
TO BOTH THE VICTIM AND TO THE

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:36.996 region:rollup2
AGGRESSORS OR OR PERPETRATORS.

02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:39.499 region:rollup2
SO AS WE IN OUR SYSTEMS NOT ONLY

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:41.334 region:rollup2
DO YOU GET REPORTED WHAT WENT ON

02:05:39.499 --> 02:05:43.669 region:rollup2
AND HE WAS INVOLVED YOU THEN DO

02:05:41.334 --> 02:05:45.004 region:rollup2
YOU REAP USE AND. DO YOUR ACTUAL

02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:46.072 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION EVERYTHING'S

02:05:45.004 --> 02:05:47.740 region:rollup2
TRACKED IN THE TIMELINE

02:05:46.072 --> 02:05:49.809 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING YOU DID AND THEN THE

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:51.544 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY SUGGEST

02:05:49.809 --> 02:05:54.013 region:rollup2
STORED UP PROCESS HE'S NEXT

02:05:51.544 --> 02:05:55.548 region:rollup2
STOPS MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES.

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:57.183 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE WERE BROUGH UP

02:05:55.548 --> 02:05:58.785 region:rollup2
INVOLVE EVERYTHING FROM HELP

02:05:57.183 --> 02:06:00.853 region:rollup2
LINES TO CONVERSATIONS

02:05:58.785 --> 02:06:02.522 region:rollup2
THE LESSONS BOTH FOR THE VICTIMS

02:06:00.853 --> 02:06:03.589 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE AGGRESSORS BECAUSE.

02:06:02.522 --> 02:06:04.757 region:rollup2
THE VICTIMS OBVIOUSLY NEED

02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:06.025 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SERVICES AND THERE'S

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:08.261 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP UNDER TITLE NINE THAT

02:06:06.025 --> 02:06:10.063 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO DO. AN ON THE

02:06:08.261 --> 02:06:11.898 region:rollup2
AGGRESSOR SIDE WE BELIEVE

02:06:10.063 --> 02:06:13.833 region:rollup2
RESTORED DISCIPLINE FOR THE MORE

02:06:11.898 --> 02:06:15.701 region:rollup2
LAST FOR THE LESSER INFRACTIONS

02:06:13.833 --> 02:06:18.137 region:rollup2
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN.

02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:22.375 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTAND SO. OUR THAT'S

02:06:18.137 --> 02:06:24.644 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESS WORKS.

02:06:22.375 --> 02:06:26.412 region:rollup2
NO IT'S IN BOTH.

02:06:24.644 --> 02:06:27.814 region:rollup2
SO WHEN THE SYSTEM WE BUILT IN

02:06:26.412 --> 02:06:29.682 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC EVERYTHING'S MEDITECH

02:06:27.814 --> 02:06:31.184 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:33.019 region:rollup2
RESOURCES SUPPORT RESOURCES

02:06:31.184 --> 02:06:34.587 region:rollup2
STATE AND LOCAL THE COMMUNITIES

02:06:33.019 --> 02:06:36.289 region:rollup2
CAN UPLOAD A META TAG ALL THEIR

02:06:34.587 --> 02:06:37.490 region:rollup2
OWN INFORMATION IN REAL TIME.

02:06:36.289 --> 02:06:40.193 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES CAN ALL

02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:41.494 region:rollup2
BE UPLOADED MEDITECH AND PUSHED

02:06:40.193 --> 02:06:43.229 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PUSH TECHNOLOGY IS THE

02:06:41.494 --> 02:06:45.031 region:rollup2
KEY. NO ONE WANTS TO FIND

02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:47.033 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ANYMORE ANY TYPE OF

02:06:45.031 --> 02:06:48.167 region:rollup2
STATIC WEBSITE OR OPT IN

02:06:47.033 --> 02:06:49.435 region:rollup2
APPROACH WHICH IS WHAT I CALL.

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:51.370 region:rollup2
STATIC.

02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:53.005 region:rollup2
DOESN'T GET MAXIMUM ENGAGEMENT

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:54.774 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO CHANGE COMMUNITY

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:56.342 region:rollup2
CULTURAL BEHAVIOR YOU WANT TO

02:06:54.774 --> 02:06:57.877 region:rollup2
START WITH EVERYONE. BEING IN

02:06:56.342 --> 02:06:59.178 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM OF SOMEONE STOPPED

02:06:57.877 --> 02:07:00.446 region:rollup2
OUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T IN A DROP

02:06:59.178 --> 02:07:02.415 region:rollup2
DOWN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:03.549 region:rollup2
THAT'S FINE BUT IF YOU START

02:07:02.415 --> 02:07:05.518 region:rollup2
FROM A HUNDRED PERCENT AND YOU

02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:07.186 region:rollup2
END UP AT NINETY PERCENT VERSUS

02:07:05.518 --> 02:07:08.354 region:rollup2
STARTING AT FIVE PERCENT TRYING

02:07:07.186 --> 02:07:10.990 region:rollup2
TO GET TEN PERCENT.

02:07:08.354 --> 02:07:12.325 region:rollup2
THE DESIRED IMPACT ON CULTURE

02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:14.193 region:rollup2
DIGITAL PEER PRESSURE AND

02:07:12.325 --> 02:07:15.928 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY IS COMPLETELY

02:07:14.193 --> 02:07:17.530 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU

02:07:15.928 --> 02:07:18.898 region:rollup2
GOT YOUR LICENSE YOU CAN OPT IN

02:07:17.530 --> 02:07:21.467 region:rollup2
TO GIVING YOUR EYES AND GIVING

02:07:18.898 --> 02:07:22.902 region:rollup2
YOUR ORGANS IN THE U. S. SO WE

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:25.471 region:rollup2
HAVE FIVE PERCENT PARTICIPATION.

02:07:22.902 --> 02:07:27.039 region:rollup2
OVERSEAS IN SCANDINAVIA YOU OPT

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:28.908 region:rollup2
OUT AND THEY GET NINETY FIVE

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:31.711 region:rollup2
PERCENT SO IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING

02:07:28.908 --> 02:07:34.013 region:rollup2
IT EASY RIGHT MAKING THE CHOICES

02:07:31.711 --> 02:07:36.716 region:rollup2
EASING. SAMPLES PATH IS ALWAYS A

02:07:34.013 --> 02:07:37.183 region:rollup2
PATH WE WANT SO AS WE BUILT THIS

02:07:36.716 --> 02:07:38.784 region:rollup2
WE BUILD IT IS CHOICE

02:07:37.183 --> 02:07:39.952 region:rollup2
ARCHITECTS.

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:42.288 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIEST

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:44.824 region:rollup2
FOR. THE VECTOR THE AGGRESSOR

02:07:42.288 --> 02:07:45.825 region:rollup2
THE BYSTANDER THE PERSON ON THE

02:07:44.824 --> 02:07:47.727 region:rollup2
TIMELINE CORD INFESTED DRESS

02:07:45.825 --> 02:07:48.661 region:rollup2
THAT THE POLICE TO HAVE TO GET

02:07:47.727 --> 02:07:50.029 region:rollup2
INVOLVED OR DON'T HAVE TO GET

02:07:48.661 --> 02:07:53.032 region:rollup2
INVOLVED THE PARENTS WHO HAVE TO

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:55.201 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP. AND SO ON SO YOU HAVE

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:57.036 region:rollup2
TO GRAEME THEORY EVERY SCENARIO

02:07:55.201 --> 02:07:58.704 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUT THERE. AND FIGURE OUT

02:07:57.036 --> 02:07:59.972 region:rollup2
OKAY WHERE WE GONNA END UP HERE

02:07:58.704 --> 02:08:01.707 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

02:07:59.972 --> 02:08:03.276 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT THE RISK REWARD OF

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:04.043 region:rollup2
STARTING THAT PROCESS AT THE

02:08:03.276 --> 02:08:06.712 region:rollup2
BEGINNING.

02:08:04.043 --> 02:08:08.447 region:rollup2
SO IN FORMING YOUR STUDENTS YOUR

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:10.750 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES YOUR LOBBYIST.

02:08:08.447 --> 02:08:12.385 region:rollup2

CHOICES NO TIMELINE COORDINATOR

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:34.307 region:rollup2
YOU CAN HANDLE IT INTERNALLY.

02:08:32.772 --> 02:08:36.642 region:rollup2
SECURITY CAN HANDLE IT ON CAMPUS

02:08:34.307 --> 02:08:38.778 region:rollup2
OR YOU GO TO THE POLICE. ALL OF

THEY'RE GOING TO DO ONE OR

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:45.084 region:rollup2

BUILD ALL THESE CHECK LOOPS INTO

02:08:48.654 --> 02:08:52.692 region:rollup2
OUR PUSH TECHNOLOGY AGAIN WE'RE

02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:54.527 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MOVE THE RISK. OFF THE

SYSTEM YOU ARE BUILDING IN

02:10:44.704 --> 02:10:46.172 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION WITH WE SAID

02:10:45.705 --> 02:10:48.074 region:rollup2

THIS WEEK IN SAN DIEGO ONE AS

02:10:48.074 --> 02:10:51.644 region:rollup2
IT WAS PRESENTED.

02:10:49.975 --> 02:10:53.579 region:rollup2
ARM AND AS I UNDERSTOOD IT.

02:10:51.644 --> 02:10:55.648 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE A DATA COLLECTION

02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:56.682 region:rollup2
TOOL BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT MADE

02:10:55.648 --> 02:10:58.684 region:rollup2
WAS THAT WE DON'T HAVE DATA

02:10:56.682 --> 02:11:00.853 region:rollup2
COLLECTION WE DON'T HAVE A SET.

02:10:58.684 --> 02:11:02.421 region:rollup2

AND SO.

02:11:06.225 --> 02:11:09.428 region:rollup2
THE TOOL BEING BUILT.

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:10.963 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT IT

02:11:09.428 --> 02:11:13.466 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A TOOL THAT COULD

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:16.035 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LAUNCH INVESTIGATION.

02:11:13.466 --> 02:11:18.137 region:rollup2
CASE MANAGEMENT TOOL USED BY

02:11:16.035 --> 02:11:19.238 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS SO TO GET BACK TO

02:11:18.137 --> 02:11:20.973 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMPS IS.

02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:22.775 region:rollup2
.

02:11:20.973 --> 02:11:25.478 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT THAT WHO OWNS THE

02:11:22.775 --> 02:11:26.812 region:rollup2
DATA SO SO HELP CLARIFY FOR ME

02:11:25.478 --> 02:11:28.447 region:rollup2
WHAT THE TO YOU TOOL YOUR BILL

02:11:26.812 --> 02:11:29.949 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR BACKGROUND.

02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:31.984 region:rollup2

COLLABORATIVELY SAID ENOUGH

02:11:35.354 --> 02:11:38.691 region:rollup2
WILL BE TO DO WHAT OKAY.

02:11:37.656 --> 02:11:40.326 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS THERE TO

02:11:38.691 --> 02:11:42.928 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ONE IS WE BUILD A

02:11:40.326 --> 02:11:44.630 region:rollup2
PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY PRIDE. AND

02:11:42.928 --> 02:11:47.433 region:rollup2
ON THAT PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY IT

02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:49.602 region:rollup2
CAN EXTEND ANY COMMUNITY. I CAN

02:11:47.433 --> 02:11:50.803 region:rollup2
CREATE A NATIVE OUT FOR THAT

02:11:49.602 --> 02:11:53.506 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS

02:11:50.803 --> 02:11:55.674 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN SIX WEEKS TIME.

BOTH ANDROID AND YOU CAN UPLOAD

02:11:55.674 --> 02:11:58.944 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOUR MATERIALS ARE AND

02:11:57.409 --> 02:12:00.379 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO CAPTURE.

02:11:58.944 --> 02:12:03.315 region:rollup2
WE SELL ENOUGH CAME TO US

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:04.750 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AND ASKED US.

02:12:03.315 --> 02:12:06.018 region:rollup2
A WHAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT BUILDING

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:07.219 region:rollup2
A MAP WHERE YOU WOULD NAME

02:12:06.018 --> 02:12:08.254 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND ALL THAT AND WE WERE

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:10.055 region:rollup2
LIKE. YOU WANT TO GATHER THE

02:12:08.254 --> 02:12:11.991 region:rollup2
DATA SO THE WHOLE IDEA BEHIND

02:12:10.055 --> 02:12:14.026 region:rollup2
THE WE SAID ENOUGH. WHICH IS A

02:12:11.991 --> 02:12:15.361 region:rollup2
SEPARATE APPLICATION IS TO DO

02:12:14.026 --> 02:12:18.798 region:rollup2
JUST THAT.

02:12:15.361 --> 02:12:20.933 region:rollup2
ANY USER. ANY FEMALE MEL

02:12:18.798 --> 02:12:23.402 region:rollup2
TRANSGENDER WHATEVER AFFILIATION

02:12:20.933 --> 02:12:25.137 region:rollup2
FATHER MOTHER CAN INPUT ANY

02:12:23.402 --> 02:12:27.173 region:rollup2
BOUNDARY CROSSING OUR SEXUAL

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:28.841 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT THAT THAT'D BE EITHER

02:12:27.173 --> 02:12:30.209 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED OR THEY SEEM. LIKE

02:12:28.841 --> 02:12:31.777 region:rollup2
MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN SEXUALLY

02:12:30.209 --> 02:12:33.145 region:rollup2
HARASSING POLYTECHNIC ROUTE

02:12:31.777 --> 02:12:34.914 region:rollup2
TIMES I COULD PUT THOSE AND.

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:37.583 region:rollup2
AND WE GATHER NOT WE GATHER WITH

02:12:34.914 --> 02:12:39.084 region:rollup2
GREAT GRANULARITY THE TYPE OF

02:12:37.583 --> 02:12:40.519 region:rollup2
SEXUAL BOUNDARY CROSSING OR

02:12:39.084 --> 02:12:42.988 region:rollup2
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT WENT ON

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:44.256 region:rollup2
WE ALSO GATHER THE PERIODICITY.

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:45.791 region:rollup2
SO WE GATHER WHAT TO DO STARRING

02:12:44.256 --> 02:12:47.193 region:rollup2
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO BECOME

02:12:45.791 --> 02:12:48.928 region:rollup2
MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL

02:12:47.193 --> 02:12:51.530 region:rollup2
COLLEGE GRADUATE SCHOOL THE

02:12:48.928 --> 02:12:53.566 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE BECAUSE THERE IS NO

02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:55.301 region:rollup2
GOOD DATA OUT THERE. ON THESE

02:12:53.566 --> 02:12:57.236 region:rollup2
THINGS AND SO THE IDEA WITH WE

02:12:55.301 --> 02:13:00.272 region:rollup2
SAID ENOUGH WAS TO LAUNCH THE

02:12:57.236 --> 02:13:02.174 region:rollup2
SAP TO THE WORLD FOR FREE.

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:03.375 region:rollup2
STARTING PROBABLY PRODUCT IS

02:13:02.174 --> 02:13:04.977 region:rollup2
APRIL FIRST BECAUSE OF SEXUAL

02:13:03.375 --> 02:13:06.212 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT WHERE THIS MONTH.

02:13:04.977 --> 02:13:07.847 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WE COULD DO IT THIS

02:13:06.212 --> 02:13:09.315 region:rollup2
WEEK IF WE WANTED TO. AND THE

02:13:07.847 --> 02:13:10.716 region:rollup2
WHOLE IDEAS TO HAVE EVERYONE OUT

02:13:09.315 --> 02:13:13.018 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:13:10.716 --> 02:13:14.253 region:rollup2
POPULATE THEIR EXPERIENCES THAT

02:13:13.018 --> 02:13:15.187 region:rollup2
THEY'VE EVER HAPPENED THAT

02:13:14.253 --> 02:13:16.689 region:rollup2
THY'VE EVER HAD AS LONG AS IT'S

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:17.289 region:rollup2
ON TRIGGERING THAT THEY WANT TO

02:13:16.689 --> 02:13:24.463 region:rollup2
SHARE BOTH NOW AND IN THE PAST

02:13:17.289 --> 02:13:27.366 region:rollup2
OR FRIEND OR SOMEONE ELSE. TO

02:13:24.463 --> 02:13:30.703 region:rollup2
REALLY MAP A LANDSCAPE OF PAIN

02:13:27.366 --> 02:13:33.105 region:rollup2
HARM SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE

02:13:30.703 --> 02:13:34.673 region:rollup2
BREADTH OF THIS ISSUE AND THE

02:13:33.105 --> 02:13:36.942 region:rollup2
DATA. ON IT WHEN I SAY PEOPLE

02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:39.378 region:rollup2
MEN WOMEN EVERYONE BECAUSE IT'S

02:13:36.942 --> 02:13:40.579 region:rollup2
UP TO ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO

02:13:39.378 --> 02:13:43.349 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS.

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:44.617 region:rollup2
AND SO NOW I'M CLEAR BETWEEN WE

02:13:43.349 --> 02:13:45.684 region:rollup2
FIT ENOUGH APT THAT'S

02:13:44.617 --> 02:13:48.220 region:rollup2
FORTHCOMING AND.

02:13:45.684 --> 02:13:51.390 region:rollup2
BRIDGET AT THAT EXIST

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:53.592 region:rollup2
SO SO YOU BUILD IT.

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:55.060 region:rollup2
I POPULATE I GUESS I CAN'T NAME

02:13:53.592 --> 02:13:57.096 region:rollup2
NAMES BECAUSE THIS DATA

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:58.430 region:rollup2
COLLECTION YOU CAN NAY NIGHTS IN

02:13:57.096 --> 02:13:59.298 region:rollup2
THIS ONE YOU CAN TIME

02:13:58.430 --> 02:14:03.002 region:rollup2
PERPETRATORS.

02:13:59.298 --> 02:14:04.069 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND AND.

02:14:03.002 --> 02:14:07.806 region:rollup2
AT IT IS THAT DATA GOAL YOU SET

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:08.841 region:rollup2
YOUR INTRO POLICYMAKERS

02:14:07.806 --> 02:14:10.376 region:rollup2
THE PRESIDENT GOES INTO A LOT

02:14:08.841 --> 02:14:12.077 region:rollup2

DO YOU ROLL IT OUT KIND OF TELL

02:14:12.077 --> 02:14:15.748 region:rollup2
THE WORLD IN THIRTY THEY ROLLED

02:14:14.613 --> 02:14:17.483 region:rollup2
OUT ON IT THE WE ROLLED OUT ON

02:14:15.748 --> 02:14:19.218 region:rollup2
THE DE IDENTIFIED EVASIVE SO

02:14:17.483 --> 02:14:20.552 region:rollup2
IT'S ALWAYS PROTECTED WE'RE NOT

02:14:19.218 --> 02:14:21.921 region:rollup2
SELLING THE DATA WERE NOT RE

02:14:20.552 --> 02:14:24.223 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTING THE DATA. FOR ANY

02:14:21.921 --> 02:14:27.826 region:rollup2
OTHER REASON WE HAVE RESEARCHERS

02:14:24.223 --> 02:14:29.194 region:rollup2
WHO MAY WANT TO MIND THE DATA ON

02:14:27.826 --> 02:14:29.728 region:rollup2
A DE IDENTIFIED BASIS

02:14:29.194 --> 02:14:31.697 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE FEEL AS THOUGH

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:32.665 region:rollup2
THAT'LL BE BENEFICIAL TO

02:14:31.697 --> 02:14:33.799 region:rollup2
SOCIETY SIMILAR ACTUALLY WANT TO

02:14:32.665 --> 02:14:34.633 region:rollup2
DO THAT. WILL PUBLISH THE DATA

02:14:33.799 --> 02:14:36.035 region:rollup2
IN REAL TIME ON OUR MAPS. SO

02:14:34.633 --> 02:14:39.171 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A CONSTANT

02:14:36.035 --> 02:14:40.372 region:rollup2
AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM GOT.

02:14:39.171 --> 02:14:41.840 region:rollup2
AS AS WE TALK ABOUT OUR OUR NEED

02:14:40.372 --> 02:14:44.677 region:rollup2
TO.

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:46.612 region:rollup2
AFFECT CULTURE CHANGE AND

02:14:44.677 --> 02:14:48.347 region:rollup2
IMPLICIT BIAS KIND OF FOCUSED

02:14:46.612 --> 02:14:50.482 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE A DATA POINT THAT

02:14:48.347 --> 02:14:52.384 region:rollup2
WE COULD HAVE A.

02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:53.485 region:rollup2
BROADER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT UC I

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:55.621 region:rollup2
THINK EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THE

02:14:53.485 --> 02:14:57.122 region:rollup2
I. T. ON THE HARVARD WEBSITE

02:14:55.621 --> 02:14:58.657 region:rollup2
I'VE TAKEN FIFTY THIRTY. TWO

02:14:57.122 --> 02:15:00.259 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES WE'VE WRITTEN ABOUT

02:14:58.657 --> 02:15:01.794 region:rollup2
IT AND BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS

02:15:00.259 --> 02:15:03.996 region:rollup2
THEIR IMPLICIT BIASES AND YOU

02:15:01.794 --> 02:15:04.797 region:rollup2
ALWAYS HAVE THEM IT'S LEARNING

02:15:03.996 --> 02:15:06.298 region:rollup2
HOW TO MANAGE YOUR EXPLOSIVE

02:15:04.797 --> 02:15:08.601 region:rollup2
BIAS. AND HAVING THOSE

02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:11.303 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS AND BY THE WAY.

02:15:08.601 --> 02:15:12.571 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION AT EVERY LEVEL IS

02:15:11.303 --> 02:15:13.973 region:rollup2
THE ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS

02:15:12.571 --> 02:15:15.541 region:rollup2
DECIDING CLIMATE WHETHER YOU'RE

02:15:13.973 --> 02:15:16.942 region:rollup2
GOING INTO SIX GREAT FOR THE

02:15:15.541 --> 02:15:19.078 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME. WHETHER YOU'RE

02:15:16.942 --> 02:15:21.347 region:rollup2
JOINING THE STATE LEGISLATURE

02:15:19.078 --> 02:15:23.082 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU'RE IN NEW LOBBYIST

02:15:21.347 --> 02:15:24.950 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GOT UP STARTING OFF AS

02:15:23.082 --> 02:15:27.286 region:rollup2
A FRESHMAN AT SCHOOL THAT

02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:29.555 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION PERIOD IS SUCH A

02:15:27.286 --> 02:15:30.789 region:rollup2
CRITICAL POINT AT WHICH TO

02:15:29.555 --> 02:15:31.657 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS.

02:15:30.789 --> 02:15:32.124 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD CHALLENGE FOLKS.

02:15:31.657 --> 02:15:33.626 region:rollup2
TO AT.

02:15:32.124 --> 02:15:34.426 region:rollup2
THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER OF

02:15:33.626 --> 02:15:35.294 region:rollup2
BILLS THAT WERE INTRODUCED IN

02:15:34.426 --> 02:15:35.928 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT ANTI

02:15:35.294 --> 02:15:37.396 region:rollup2
BELIEVED I WAS A MEMBER OF THE

02:15:35.928 --> 02:15:39.131 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY WHEN MANY THOSE BILLS

02:15:37.396 --> 02:15:40.833 region:rollup2
WERE DEBATED AND HEARD CITY

02:15:39.131 --> 02:15:42.401 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. TALK

02:15:40.833 --> 02:15:43.068 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE SHOULD JUST MAN

02:15:42.401 --> 02:15:45.070 region:rollup2
UP IN BUILDING WASN'T THAT BIG A

02:15:43.068 --> 02:15:46.205 region:rollup2
DEAL AND SO THE REASON I TALK

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:47.439 region:rollup2
ABOUT IMPLICIT BIASES BECAUSE

02:15:46.205 --> 02:15:49.241 region:rollup2
THAT LIVED HERE AND EXPERIENCED

02:15:47.439 --> 02:15:51.710 region:rollup2
AND HEARD IT FIRST HAND. AND SO

02:15:49.241 --> 02:15:53.045 region:rollup2
NOW WE ALL SEEM TO BE SINGING

02:15:51.710 --> 02:15:55.014 region:rollup2
THE SAME THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:15:53.045 --> 02:15:56.815 region:rollup2
IN A SHAME BUT FOLKS NEED TO BE

02:15:55.014 --> 02:15:57.850 region:rollup2
HELD ACCOUNTABLE ABOUT. WHAT

02:15:56.815 --> 02:16:00.519 region:rollup2
THEY THOUGHT AND WHAT THEY

02:15:57.850 --> 02:16:03.489 region:rollup2
VIEWED A GREAT READ IS WHISTLING

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:06.425 region:rollup2
VIVALDI FOR THOSE OF YOU HAVE

02:16:03.489 --> 02:16:11.096 region:rollup2
READ IT IT'S A GREAT READ? LET

02:16:06.425 --> 02:16:11.497 region:rollup2
ME MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ROBERT.

02:16:11.096 --> 02:16:12.664 region:rollup2
ARE IN TERMS OF.

02:16:11.497 --> 02:16:13.666 region:rollup2
HOW MANY COMPANIES HAVE ARE

02:16:12.664 --> 02:16:14.600 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY USING CANDOR AND WHAT'S

02:16:13.666 --> 02:16:15.234 region:rollup2
THE FEEDBACK YOU GET? WE ONLY

02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:15.634 region:rollup2
HAVE A COUPLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

02:16:15.234 --> 02:16:17.669 region:rollup2
WE JUST LAUNCHED.

02:16:15.634 --> 02:16:19.872 region:rollup2
INTERESTINGLY MOST OF THAT.

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:21.440 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EMPLOYEE CLAIMS OF

02:16:19.872 --> 02:16:23.042 region:rollup2
COMING SO FAR ARE NOT ABOUT

02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:24.810 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT ALL

02:16:23.042 --> 02:16:28.313 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT SURPRISING.

02:16:24.810 --> 02:16:34.286 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THEM ARE SHIITES.

02:16:28.313 --> 02:16:34.286 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT ISSUES DATED DAYS.

02:16:34.353 --> 02:16:40.059 region:rollup2
THIS PERSON'S LOOKING AT ME OR

02:16:37.189 --> 02:16:42.094 region:rollup2
TREATING ME OR I WOULD EVEN CALL

02:16:40.059 --> 02:16:43.829 region:rollup2
THEM PULLING ISSUE JUST CONFLICT

02:16:42.094 --> 02:16:44.697 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE ISSUES WHICH.

02:16:43.829 --> 02:16:46.432 region:rollup2
BUT HONESTLY.

02:16:44.697 --> 02:16:48.467 region:rollup2
I THINK.

02:16:46.432 --> 02:16:50.169 region:rollup2
THIS PRESENTS.

02:16:48.467 --> 02:16:52.004 region:rollup2
GREAT PRESSURE VALVE.

02:16:50.169 --> 02:16:53.972 region:rollup2
.

02:16:52.004 --> 02:16:55.641 region:rollup2
THE FIRST CLIENT WE LAUNCHED

02:16:53.972 --> 02:16:57.676 region:rollup2
THAT IS IT.

02:16:55.641 --> 02:16:58.577 region:rollup2
CLIENT THAT I'VE HAD FOR YEARS

02:16:57.676 --> 02:17:01.080 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE A TRADITIONAL

02:16:58.577 --> 02:17:02.147 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER HOTLINES.

02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:03.582 region:rollup2
AND THEY TOLD US THAT THEY

02:17:02.147 --> 02:17:05.217 region:rollup2
NORMALLY GET A COUPLE OF PHONE

02:17:03.582 --> 02:17:07.920 region:rollup2
CALLS A MONTH OUT OF THE EIGHT

02:17:05.217 --> 02:17:09.621 region:rollup2
HUNDRED NUMBER. AND THE AMOUNT

02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:11.724 region:rollup2
OF OF.

02:17:09.621 --> 02:17:13.092 region:rollup2
HICKS THEY GOT ON CANDOR WAS

02:17:11.724 --> 02:17:15.094 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT MORE EVEN IN THE

02:17:13.092 --> 02:17:16.929 region:rollup2
FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

02:17:15.094 --> 02:17:18.664 region:rollup2
SO THE ENGAGEMENT LEVEL WE THINK

02:17:16.929 --> 02:17:19.631 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE A LOT HIGHER. BUT

02:17:18.664 --> 02:17:21.500 region:rollup2
HONESTLY JUST

02:17:19.631 --> 02:17:24.636 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:26.138 region:rollup2
DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEES.

02:17:24.636 --> 02:17:28.240 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE GRUMBLING LEVEL THAT

02:17:26.138 --> 02:17:30.309 region:rollup2
I'M FEELING AMONGST MY CLIENT

02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:32.678 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE BASE HAS BEEN GROWING

02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:34.480 region:rollup2
OF THE LAST FEW.

02:17:32.678 --> 02:17:36.148 region:rollup2
MONTHS MAYBE EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO

02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:38.751 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS COULD BE A REALLY

02:17:36.148 --> 02:17:40.552 region:rollup2
INTERESTING PRESSURE VALVE.

02:17:38.751 --> 02:17:42.020 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW STEAM HEALTH YOU KNOW

02:17:40.552 --> 02:17:44.690 region:rollup2
KIND OF THING THAT I THINK WILL

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:46.859 region:rollup2
HELP. EVEN IF IT'S NOT SEXUAL

02:17:44.690 --> 02:17:49.361 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT JUST TO SORT OF LET

02:17:46.859 --> 02:17:51.597 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES VENT. AND WHEN I'M

02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:53.966 region:rollup2

GET BACK TO PEOPLE IS WHAT

THEY'RE TELLING ME. SO THEY'RE

02:18:00.139 --> 02:18:03.108 region:rollup2

DO THE TEXT ORGANIZATION TO BEG

02:20:44.603 --> 02:20:48.206 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION.

02:20:46.138 --> 02:20:50.409 region:rollup2
IF NINETY PERCENT ARE REPEAT

02:20:48.206 --> 02:20:51.710 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS WHAT IS HAPPENING THE

02:20:50.409 --> 02:20:54.346 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME THEIR FANDOM THE

02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:56.248 region:rollup2
SECOND TIME THEY HAVE FOUND.

02:20:54.346 --> 02:20:57.516 region:rollup2
YEAH AND MANY FROM COLLEGE

02:20:56.248 --> 02:20:59.284 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES WE KNOW STUDENTS ARE

02:20:57.516 --> 02:21:00.686 region:rollup2
REPORTING.

02:20:59.284 --> 02:21:02.354 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FEEL LIKE IT IS AN

02:21:00.686 --> 02:21:03.622 region:rollup2
ISOLATED EVENT AND SO THEY ARE

02:21:02.354 --> 02:21:06.858 region:rollup2
NOT REPORTING THAT INFORMATION

02:21:03.622 --> 02:21:08.327 region:rollup2
BUT THEN ONCE ONE PERSON THAT'S.

02:21:06.858 --> 02:21:09.661 region:rollup2
SUCH IN A COLLEGE CAMPUS SO WE

02:21:08.327 --> 02:21:10.796 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN CALLED THE RUMOR MILL.

02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:12.130 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE ONCE USES LIKE

02:21:10.796 --> 02:21:13.365 region:rollup2
I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS IN SOMEONE

02:21:12.130 --> 02:21:15.434 region:rollup2
ELSE'S I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT TOO

02:21:13.365 --> 02:21:18.070 region:rollup2
WE REALIZE IT'S THE SAME PERSON

02:21:15.434 --> 02:21:18.737 region:rollup2
SAME INDIVIDUAL? IS A THAT'S WHY

02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:20.372 region:rollup2
THE COSTUMES LOOK WE'RE LOOKING

02:21:18.737 --> 02:21:22.574 region:rollup2
AT CLIMATE. IS A CALLISTO ALLOWS

02:21:20.372 --> 02:21:24.009 region:rollup2
FOR US AND WE HAVE OTHER FORMS

02:21:22.574 --> 02:21:25.944 region:rollup2
OF REPORTING AS WELL SO WE HAVE

02:21:24.009 --> 02:21:27.179 region:rollup2
MAXI IT WAS A DATABASE FOR

02:21:25.944 --> 02:21:28.080 region:rollup2
STUDENTS CAN GO ON A REPORT

02:21:27.179 --> 02:21:29.614 region:rollup2
STAFF AND FACULTY CAN GO

02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:31.650 region:rollup2
UNREPORTED INCIDENTS. AND WE

02:21:29.614 --> 02:21:32.751 region:rollup2
TRACK BEHAVIORS SO I GET TO

02:21:31.650 --> 02:21:33.952 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS OF THE THING STUDENT

02:21:32.751 --> 02:21:35.987 region:rollup2
WERE OUT REACHING TO THE

02:21:33.952 --> 02:21:38.256 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WERE SAYING. HEY

02:21:35.987 --> 02:21:39.391 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF IF THAT SURVIVOR

02:21:38.256 --> 02:21:43.462 region:rollup2
VICTOR WANTS TO COME FORWARD

02:21:39.391 --> 02:21:43.862 region:rollup2
SAYING WE'VE BEEN MADE AWARE OF

02:21:43.462 --> 02:21:44.463 region:rollup2
THESE BEHAVIORS.

02:21:43.862 --> 02:21:44.963 region:rollup2
WE NEED YOU TO COME INTO OUR

02:21:44.463 --> 02:21:46.665 region:rollup2
OFFICE WE NEED TO HAVE A

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:48.133 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE MAY BE GOING TO

02:21:46.665 --> 02:21:49.334 region:rollup2
A FORMAL INVESTIGATION BECAUSE

02:21:48.133 --> 02:21:51.236 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO

02:21:49.334 --> 02:21:52.671 region:rollup2
STOP THAT BEHAVIOR. AS EARLY AS

02:21:51.236 --> 02:21:55.273 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T

02:21:52.671 --> 02:21:56.141 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

02:21:55.273 --> 02:21:58.844 region:rollup2
ONE COMMENT TENS OF THAT

02:21:56.141 --> 02:22:01.279 region:rollup2
QUESTION. PEOPLE SELECT VICTIMS

02:21:58.844 --> 02:22:03.648 region:rollup2
THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT.

02:22:01.279 --> 02:22:04.983 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE LOW SELF ESTEEM THE

02:22:03.648 --> 02:22:06.952 region:rollup2
GROOM THEM THEY MAKE THEM FEEL

02:22:04.983 --> 02:22:08.053 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WENT ON

02:22:06.952 --> 02:22:09.888 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GAVE ME THE

02:22:08.053 --> 02:22:12.391 region:rollup2
MESSAGES.

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:14.459 region:rollup2
AND SO PART OF WHAT GOES ON WITH

02:22:12.391 --> 02:22:16.762 region:rollup2
PREDATION IS HOW YOU SELECT

02:22:14.459 --> 02:22:18.230 region:rollup2
SOMEONE AND YOU TO SOMEONE WHO.

02:22:16.762 --> 02:22:19.598 region:rollup2
IS LESS LIKELY TO COME FORWARD

02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:20.565 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE SAID ENOUGH IN

02:22:19.598 --> 02:22:21.700 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE THINGS EMPOWER

02:22:20.565 --> 02:22:22.968 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO COME

02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:23.969 region:rollup2
FORWARD. THAT'S PART OF WHAT

02:22:22.968 --> 02:22:26.371 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

02:22:23.969 --> 02:22:29.041 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL.

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:31.209 region:rollup2
IN THE BROCHURE.

02:22:29.041 --> 02:22:32.577 region:rollup2
TITLE TITLE MY FOR UNIVERSITY

02:22:31.209 --> 02:22:34.079 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO.

02:22:32.577 --> 02:22:35.414 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDDLE SECTION OF SAYS

BROAD RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SOCIAL

02:22:36.748 --> 02:22:41.920 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS FOCUSED ON SEX.

02:22:40.018 --> 02:22:44.089 region:rollup2
EIGHT ONE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:45.957 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM OTHER SPEAKERS OF THE

02:22:44.089 --> 02:22:48.427 region:rollup2
PRESENTERS. IS THAT IT'S NOT

02:22:45.957 --> 02:22:50.796 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEX IT'S ABOUT POWER NAY

02:22:48.427 --> 02:22:52.998 region:rollup2
GOES BACK TO BASICALLY GROOMING

02:22:50.796 --> 02:22:54.466 region:rollup2
THIS PERSON TO MAKE THEM FEEL

02:22:52.998 --> 02:22:55.734 region:rollup2
POWERLESS.

02:22:54.466 --> 02:23:00.072 region:rollup2
NEXT TO YOU.

02:22:55.734 --> 02:23:01.206 region:rollup2
TO THEM.

02:23:00.072 --> 02:23:03.241 region:rollup2
TO THAT TO THEM

02:23:01.206 --> 02:23:04.643 region:rollup2
SHIRLEY HARASS THEM.

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:06.978 region:rollup2
GREAT OVER OUR BROCHURE HERE'S

02:23:04.643 --> 02:23:08.146 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON FACTS INTERGENDERTHAT

02:23:06.978 --> 02:23:09.681 region:rollup2
HAVE LIKE INEFFECTIVE STARTING

02:23:08.146 --> 02:23:11.683 region:rollup2
SO WE BREAK IT DOWN FOR EACH

02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:14.086 region:rollup2
POLICY SO SEXUAL RASCO IT

02:23:11.683 --> 02:23:15.387 region:rollup2
AWFULLY NO THAT'S MORE SO IT CAN

02:23:14.086 --> 02:23:16.822 region:rollup2
BE BASED ON HER POWER DYNAMICS.

02:23:15.387 --> 02:23:19.091 region:rollup2
SO MY FACULTY MEMBER ARE

02:23:16.822 --> 02:23:20.225 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR SAYS. HEY YOU NEED TO

02:23:19.091 --> 02:23:21.126 region:rollup2

COME TO OFFICE HOURS YOU'RE NOT

02:23:21.126 --> 02:23:23.895 region:rollup2
GOING TO PASS THIS COURSE WE

02:23:22.794 --> 02:23:25.664 region:rollup2
KNOW THOSE POWER DIFFERENTIALS

02:23:23.895 --> 02:23:26.798 region:rollup2
THERE BEFORE BASED ON WHO ARE

02:23:25.664 --> 02:23:27.833 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LIKE THE FEDERAL

02:23:26.798 --> 02:23:29.601 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES BASED OFF OF ITS ARE

02:23:27.833 --> 02:23:30.836 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION BASED OFF OF SEX

02:23:29.601 --> 02:23:32.938 region:rollup2
OR GENDER. IS ABOUT WITH THIS

02:23:30.836 --> 02:23:36.675 region:rollup2

MISTAKEN FROM BOZEMAN OF SORRY.

02:23:36.675 --> 02:23:38.677 region:rollup2
I THINK SO.

02:23:38.110 --> 02:23:40.245 region:rollup2
IF YOU IS IT DIFFERENT WHEN

02:23:38.677 --> 02:23:42.848 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A FACULTY

02:23:40.245 --> 02:23:45.317 region:rollup2
MEMBER WHO IS SEXUALLY HARASSING

02:23:42.848 --> 02:23:48.453 region:rollup2
OR HAS RAPED A STUDENT.

02:23:45.317 --> 02:23:49.955 region:rollup2
VERSUS STUDENT ON STUDENT.

02:23:48.453 --> 02:23:51.756 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS THERE ARE PROCESS.

02:23:49.955 --> 02:23:53.492 region:rollup2
.

02:23:51.756 --> 02:23:54.526 region:rollup2
ALL PARTIES LIKE WE HAVE.

02:23:53.492 --> 02:23:56.128 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS STARTS WITH THAT THE

02:23:54.526 --> 02:23:58.296 region:rollup2
REPORT.

02:23:56.128 --> 02:24:00.165 region:rollup2
I'M IF THERE IS A FACULTY MEMBER

02:23:58.296 --> 02:24:01.766 region:rollup2
INVOLVED WITH A STUDENT. THAT

02:24:00.165 --> 02:24:03.835 region:rollup2
WAS GONNA GO THROUGH TITLE NINE

02:24:01.766 --> 02:24:05.470 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO EACH ARE.

02:24:03.835 --> 02:24:07.205 region:rollup2
I'M IF IT'S STUDENTS IF IT'S

02:24:05.470 --> 02:24:07.973 region:rollup2
ONLY STUDENTS OF ALL THE PROCESS

02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:10.041 region:rollup2
SINCE GONNA GO THROUGH TITLE

02:24:07.973 --> 02:24:12.010 region:rollup2
NINE AND THEN STUDENT CON.

02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:12.911 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROCESS AS FAR AS AND

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:15.747 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SERVICES IN THE

02:24:12.911 --> 02:24:17.415 region:rollup2
RESOURCES. IS ALL GOING TO BE

02:24:15.747 --> 02:24:17.983 region:rollup2
THE SAME IT'S JUST OPINION WHICH

02:24:17.415 --> 02:24:20.151 region:rollup2
OFFICE IS GOING TO TAKE THE

02:24:17.983 --> 02:24:21.219 region:rollup2
LEAD.

02:24:20.151 --> 02:24:22.587 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T COVERAGE OF JAPAN

02:24:21.219 --> 02:24:25.390 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF I THINK USED TO

02:24:22.587 --> 02:24:27.225 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT FACTORS HERE.

02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:28.894 region:rollup2
I'M ONE IS WE KNOW IN OUR PUBLIC

02:24:27.225 --> 02:24:30.328 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS NINETY PERCENT OF

02:24:28.894 --> 02:24:31.830 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ARE

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:33.632 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES ABUSE BECAUSE THEY

02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:35.267 region:rollup2
MAKE SUCH BAD REPORTERS.

02:24:33.632 --> 02:24:37.302 region:rollup2
UP PART OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH

02:24:35.267 --> 02:24:39.404 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN COLLEGES

02:24:37.302 --> 02:24:41.072 region:rollup2
WHICH IS DRIVEN ALL THIS WAS THE

02:24:39.404 --> 02:24:42.874 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR WOULD SAY THE PERSON'S

02:24:41.072 --> 02:24:44.976 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN THERE ARE COLLEGE.

02:24:42.874 --> 02:24:46.578 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE IS A SENSE OF ARE

02:24:44.976 --> 02:24:47.779 region:rollup2
YOU ABLE TO SAY YES WHEN THERE'S

02:24:46.578 --> 02:24:49.614 region:rollup2
THAT MUCH OF A POWER

02:24:47.779 --> 02:24:51.082 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL THAT'S WHY SEXUAL

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:52.450 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT IS FREQUENTLY DEFINED

02:24:51.082 --> 02:24:53.885 region:rollup2
IN FRONT. IN TERMS OF QUID PRO

02:24:52.450 --> 02:24:55.287 region:rollup2
QUO.

02:24:53.885 --> 02:24:57.222 region:rollup2
IS THIS CAN AFFECT YOUR GRADE

02:24:55.287 --> 02:24:58.690 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU GET IN RETURN. AND THE

02:24:57.222 --> 02:24:59.891 region:rollup2
SAME THING HAPPENS IN IN TERMS

02:24:58.690 --> 02:25:01.059 region:rollup2
OF THE ASSEMBLY WHAT'S GONNA

02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:02.193 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO YOUR CAREER GOING TO

02:25:01.059 --> 02:25:03.461 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN

02:25:02.193 --> 02:25:06.097 region:rollup2
POLITICS.

02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:06.798 region:rollup2
UNLESS IF YOU SAY NO IF YOU PUSH

02:25:06.097 --> 02:25:08.600 region:rollup2
SOMEONE AWAY WITH THE BE

02:25:06.798 --> 02:25:10.535 region:rollup2
OFFENDED. AND SO THOSE ARE THE

02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:12.938 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT BRING IT IN TERMS OF

02:25:10.535 --> 02:25:14.439 region:rollup2
POWER. BUT THERE'S GRATIFICATION

02:25:12.938 --> 02:25:16.908 region:rollup2
BEING SADDAM MANY DIFFERENT LATE

02:25:14.439 --> 02:25:18.376 region:rollup2
LEVELS THAT ARE INTERSECTING.

02:25:16.908 --> 02:25:19.544 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS SO

02:25:18.376 --> 02:25:21.146 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE FOCUSING

02:25:19.544 --> 02:25:22.013 region:rollup2
ON.

02:25:21.146 --> 02:25:23.381 region:rollup2
I'M ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT WORK

02:25:22.013 --> 02:25:25.016 region:rollup2
WITH HIS COMMUNITY MATTERS THE

02:25:23.381 --> 02:25:26.718 region:rollup2
DEALS WITH BOWLING.

02:25:25.016 --> 02:25:29.154 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE

02:25:26.718 --> 02:25:30.255 region:rollup2
MAKE REAL GENUINE CONNECTIONS

02:25:29.154 --> 02:25:31.489 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE A CONNECTION

02:25:30.255 --> 02:25:33.391 region:rollup2
WITH SOME OF THE HEART YOU'RE

02:25:31.489 --> 02:25:34.426 region:rollup2
LESS LIKELY TO HARM SOMEONE.

02:25:33.391 --> 02:25:36.895 region:rollup2
THE SHOOTINGS WE JUST SAW ON

02:25:34.426 --> 02:25:37.362 region:rollup2
PARK LAND INVOLVED A YOUNG MAN

02:25:36.895 --> 02:25:38.597 region:rollup2
WHO DID HAVE VERY GOOD

02:25:37.362 --> 02:25:39.731 region:rollup2
CONNECTIONS

02:25:38.597 --> 02:25:42.367 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE SOMEONE TO

02:25:39.731 --> 02:25:44.169 region:rollup2
AN OBJECT. IF YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE

02:25:42.367 --> 02:25:45.303 region:rollup2
OF EMPATHY WE HAVE TO WORK

02:25:44.169 --> 02:25:46.771 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND CREATING

02:25:45.303 --> 02:25:47.939 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S APATHY

02:25:46.771 --> 02:25:50.709 region:rollup2
THAT HOUSE BE PART OF.

02:25:47.939 --> 02:25:52.577 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS DIALOGUE.

02:25:50.709 --> 02:25:53.945 region:rollup2
THE REASON FOR MY QUESTIONS IS

02:25:52.577 --> 02:25:55.780 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT WHEN

02:25:53.945 --> 02:25:58.249 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:59.351 region:rollup2
CO EMPLOYEES SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

02:25:58.249 --> 02:26:01.920 region:rollup2
BETWEEN EMPLOYEES HERE IN THE

02:25:59.351 --> 02:26:04.389 region:rollup2
CAPITAL AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT

02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:06.291 region:rollup2
FROM LEGISLATOR SUPERVISOR

02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:08.093 region:rollup2
TOWARDS AN EMPLOYEE. BECAUSE OF

02:26:06.291 --> 02:26:10.629 region:rollup2
THE POWER DYNAMICS

02:26:08.093 --> 02:26:11.763 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT I WOULD IMAGINE

02:26:10.629 --> 02:26:13.832 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE ARE DEALT WITH

02:26:11.763 --> 02:26:14.866 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY.

02:26:13.832 --> 02:26:15.967 region:rollup2
YEAH YEAH BUT WHEN YOU SEE

02:26:14.866 --> 02:26:17.202 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE SURVIVOR YOU KNOW

02:26:15.967 --> 02:26:19.037 region:rollup2
THEIR CLIQUES THEIR FORMED

02:26:17.202 --> 02:26:20.205 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WANNA GET ACCEPTED. THAT

02:26:19.037 --> 02:26:21.439 region:rollup2
THERE A LOT OF RELATIONSHIP

02:26:20.205 --> 02:26:22.674 region:rollup2
DYNAMICS THAT GO ON EVEN WHEN

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:24.175 region:rollup2
THEIR PEERS.

02:26:22.674 --> 02:26:24.709 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE'RE REALLY FORTUNE

02:26:24.175 --> 02:26:26.711 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE THAT WE HAVE

02:26:24.709 --> 02:26:27.679 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATIVE CAN.

02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:29.014 region:rollup2
WHAT I YOU KNOW WHAT POSITION

02:26:27.679 --> 02:26:31.416 region:rollup2
ARE YOU AND HOW DO YOU FEEL

02:26:29.014 --> 02:26:33.018 region:rollup2
ABOUT AT ARE YOU ABLE TO SAY NO?

02:26:31.416 --> 02:26:34.352 region:rollup2
I'M ALL THOSE THINGS BECOME

02:26:33.018 --> 02:26:35.854 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE

02:26:34.352 --> 02:26:37.889 region:rollup2
TRY TO BUILD INTO BRIDGET WHERE

02:26:35.854 --> 02:26:38.390 region:rollup2
THEIR SUPPORT IF SOMEONE FEELS

02:26:37.889 --> 02:26:39.658 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES STUCK IN THAT

02:26:38.390 --> 02:26:40.959 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

02:26:39.658 --> 02:26:42.227 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE COULD TALK ABOUT

02:26:40.959 --> 02:26:42.694 region:rollup2
WHAT HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS WHEN

02:26:42.227 --> 02:26:44.229 region:rollup2
YOU'RE IN THAT TYPE OF

02:26:42.694 --> 02:26:45.930 region:rollup2
SITUATION?

02:26:44.229 --> 02:26:46.998 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE A

02:26:45.930 --> 02:26:48.366 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE MEN WERE VERY

02:26:46.998 --> 02:26:50.035 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

02:26:48.366 --> 02:26:51.002 region:rollup2
THE REALLY HAVE NOT LEARNED

02:26:50.035 --> 02:26:52.671 region:rollup2
INTERPERSONAL SKILLS THEY KNOW

02:26:51.002 --> 02:26:53.505 region:rollup2
HOW TO SPEAK IN ME IN FRONT OF

02:26:52.671 --> 02:26:55.607 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW

02:26:53.505 --> 02:26:56.174 region:rollup2
TO ASK SOMEONE WHETHER THEY'RE

02:26:55.607 --> 02:26:57.309 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN THEM AND THEY

02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:58.543 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:26:57.309 --> 02:27:00.045 region:rollup2
OF BOTH.

02:26:58.543 --> 02:27:02.247 region:rollup2
HIGH.

02:27:00.045 --> 02:27:04.082 region:rollup2
SILVA VALUE BUT LOW SELF ESTEEM

02:27:02.247 --> 02:27:05.383 region:rollup2
UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE AND AND

02:27:04.082 --> 02:27:07.285 region:rollup2
THEY DO THINGS LIKE EXPOSE

02:27:05.383 --> 02:27:07.919 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES AND DO THINGS YOU SAY

02:27:07.285 --> 02:27:08.920 region:rollup2
THEY'RE AFRAID THEY'RE GONNA GET

02:27:07.919 --> 02:27:10.822 region:rollup2
REJECTED.

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:12.457 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS SO

02:27:10.822 --> 02:27:13.725 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE

02:27:12.457 --> 02:27:15.327 region:rollup2
THE PATHWAYS WERE THE SIGNS OF

02:27:13.725 --> 02:27:16.761 region:rollup2
THESE INDIVIDUALS HOW HOW CAN WE

02:27:15.327 --> 02:27:18.296 region:rollup2
HELP THEM CONNECTED A LEVEL

02:27:16.761 --> 02:27:20.031 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY DON'T LOSE THE SENSE

02:27:18.296 --> 02:27:21.566 region:rollup2
OF THE PERSON. THAT THEY ARE

02:27:20.031 --> 02:27:23.368 region:rollup2
HARMING.

02:27:21.566 --> 02:27:25.303 region:rollup2
BY THEIR CONDUCT AND DON'T

02:27:23.368 --> 02:27:26.871 region:rollup2
FORGET DON'T FORGET TO THAT THAT

02:27:25.303 --> 02:27:28.640 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT CO

02:27:26.871 --> 02:27:29.841 region:rollup2
WORKERS THAT.

02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:31.409 region:rollup2
EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A QUID

02:27:29.841 --> 02:27:33.011 region:rollup2
PRO QUO SITUATION YOU HAD A

02:27:31.409 --> 02:27:34.079 region:rollup2
HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT SITUATION

SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THEY'RE

02:27:35.413 --> 02:27:37.582 region:rollup2

SOMEONE AND SO.

02:29:32.697 --> 02:29:35.934 region:rollup2
IT DEPENDS WHAT THE BEHAVIOR IS

02:29:34.699 --> 02:29:37.535 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE ACTION AS IF WE

02:29:35.934 --> 02:29:38.903 region:rollup2
COULD STOP SOMETHING EARLIER.

02:29:37.535 --> 02:29:39.971 region:rollup2
THEN THERE ISN'T SOMETHING LEGAL

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:41.706 region:rollup2
AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE TERMINATED

02:29:39.971 --> 02:29:43.174 region:rollup2
OR PUT ON LEAVE. SO WERE TRYING

02:29:41.706 --> 02:29:45.043 region:rollup2

EARLIER IN TERMS OF WHAT IS

02:29:48.046 --> 02:29:51.916 region:rollup2
GOING ON RYAN A RELATIONSHIP.

02:29:49.681 --> 02:29:52.750 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT

02:29:51.916 --> 02:29:53.585 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE IS THIS TYPE OF

02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:56.054 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP.

02:29:53.585 --> 02:29:57.355 region:rollup2
.

02:29:56.054 --> 02:29:59.090 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN'T CONSENT TO THE

02:29:57.355 --> 02:30:00.425 region:rollup2
POWER DIFFERENTIAL.

02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:01.626 region:rollup2
LIKE THERAPIST CAN HAVE SEX WITH

02:30:00.425 --> 02:30:03.528 region:rollup2
PATIENTS DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE

02:30:09.133 --> 02:30:12.337 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A CERTAIN POSITION.

02:30:10.802 --> 02:30:13.438 region:rollup2
SOMEONE REALLY CAN'T CONSENT AND

02:30:12.337 --> 02:30:15.006 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE FOR YOU

02:30:13.438 --> 02:30:15.974 region:rollup2
TO GET INVOLVED WITH THEM. SO

02:30:15.006 --> 02:30:17.108 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU CATCH IT EARLY

02:30:15.974 --> 02:30:18.443 region:rollup2
ENOUGH

FOR EDUCATION.

02:30:25.316 --> 02:30:28.119 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:30:26.618 --> 02:30:29.220 region:rollup2
DO WITH PREVENTION IS HAVE

02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:31.356 region:rollup2
PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT IN A

02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:32.891 region:rollup2
TIMELY FASHION BEFORE SOMEONE

THEY'VE CROSSED THE LINE THEN

02:30:38.763 --> 02:30:41.766 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE TO BE CONSEQUENCE YES

02:30:40.732 --> 02:30:43.501 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE CONSEQUENCES

02:30:41.766 --> 02:30:45.069 region:rollup2
REPEAT BEHAVIOR OF IT IF THERE

02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:46.671 region:rollup2
ARE CONSEQUENCES IT CONTINUES

02:30:45.069 --> 02:30:48.706 region:rollup2
AND YOU WANT THE CONSEQUENCES TO

02:30:46.671 --> 02:30:49.474 region:rollup2
BE PROPORTIONAL. AND ONE OF THE

02:30:48.706 --> 02:30:51.242 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH HOSTILE WORK

02:30:49.474 --> 02:30:52.477 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THAT HAPPENS IS WE

02:30:58.616 --> 02:31:02.253 region:rollup2
EVALUATING SOMEONE WHO USED TO

02:31:00.518 --> 02:31:04.055 region:rollup2
WORK IN THE TEXAS LEGISLATURE IS

02:31:02.253 --> 02:31:05.823 region:rollup2
A PAGE. THEY USE TO MAKE THE

02:31:04.055 --> 02:31:07.425 region:rollup2
WOMEN WHO WERE PAGES WHERE LOW

02:31:05.823 --> 02:31:08.426 region:rollup2
CUT TOPS AND TRY TO SEE WHO

02:31:07.425 --> 02:31:09.460 region:rollup2
COULD PUT THE MOST AMOUNT OF

02:31:08.426 --> 02:31:10.929 region:rollup2
QUARTERS IN THEIR TOPS BY THE

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:12.196 region:rollup2
END OF THE DAY.

02:31:10.929 --> 02:31:12.997 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT WAS THE SORT OF

02:31:12.196 --> 02:31:14.799 region:rollup2
CULTURE THAT EXISTED IN THE

02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:16.267 region:rollup2
TEXAS LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TO BE

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:17.635 region:rollup2
AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN

02:31:16.267 --> 02:31:18.670 region:rollup2
TERMS OF GOVERNMENT. AND AND

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:20.672 region:rollup2
CULTURE AND AND WHAT'S

02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:22.273 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE.

02:31:20.672 --> 02:31:24.008 region:rollup2
MY HAS NOT SO PROUD OF THE WAY

02:31:22.273 --> 02:31:26.244 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PUT

02:31:24.008 --> 02:31:28.012 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND THE VERY FIRST

02:31:26.244 --> 02:31:29.514 region:rollup2
MEETING HAD TO DO WITH CULTURE.

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:31.749 region:rollup2
IN CHANGING THE CULTURE.

02:31:29.514 --> 02:31:34.385 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE IT BEGINS.

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:36.888 region:rollup2
THIS CHANGE IN THE CULTURE.

02:31:34.385 --> 02:31:38.790 region:rollup2
BUT I'D LIKE TO ALSO ADD THAT.

02:31:36.888 --> 02:31:39.724 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE IN YOUR EXAMPLE

02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:42.060 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU HAVE A PROFESSOR IN A

02:31:39.724 --> 02:31:42.360 region:rollup2
AND IT'S AND A GRADUATE STUDENT

02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:43.661 region:rollup2
OR STUDENT.

02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:45.029 region:rollup2
.

02:31:43.661 --> 02:31:46.531 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE PROSSER'S BREAKING

02:31:45.029 --> 02:31:47.265 region:rollup2
POLICY STEPPING OVER THE LINE IN

02:31:46.531 --> 02:31:48.900 region:rollup2
SO MANY WAYS BECAUSE OF THE

02:31:47.265 --> 02:31:50.001 region:rollup2
POWER IMBALANCE.

02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:51.836 region:rollup2
THERE NEEDS TO BE PUNITIVE

02:31:50.001 --> 02:31:53.571 region:rollup2
RESPONSE BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO

02:31:51.836 --> 02:31:55.673 region:rollup2
BE RESTORED OF RESPONSE.

02:31:53.571 --> 02:31:57.241 region:rollup2
AND THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE

02:31:55.673 --> 02:31:59.544 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT SOLVING THE LONG TERM

02:31:57.241 --> 02:32:00.979 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. AND IT'S A LONG TERM

02:31:59.544 --> 02:32:02.547 region:rollup2
PROBLEM FOR THE FACULTY MEMBER

02:32:00.979 --> 02:32:03.948 region:rollup2
BUT YOU STILL HAVE NOT RESOLVE

02:32:02.547 --> 02:32:05.149 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE FOR THE STUDENT.

02:32:03.948 --> 02:32:06.784 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE PROFESSOR IT IN THIS

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:08.620 region:rollup2
CASE.

02:32:06.784 --> 02:32:09.988 region:rollup2
HAS HE USED THEIR POWER SO YOU

02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:11.823 region:rollup2
YOU WERE YOU'RE WORKING ON

02:32:09.988 --> 02:32:12.623 region:rollup2
RESTORATIVE. DISCIPLINE FOR THE

02:32:11.823 --> 02:32:14.892 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO

02:32:12.623 --> 02:32:17.061 region:rollup2
THE VICTIM.

02:32:14.892 --> 02:32:18.363 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IN THAT

02:32:17.061 --> 02:32:20.098 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT THE PROP THE

02:32:18.363 --> 02:32:22.333 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR NEEDS TO BE REMOVED

02:32:20.098 --> 02:32:24.502 region:rollup2
FROM THE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THE

02:32:22.333 --> 02:32:26.537 region:rollup2
STUDENT CAN'T THRIVE OTHERWISE

02:32:24.502 --> 02:32:28.373 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME.

02:32:26.537 --> 02:32:29.807 region:rollup2
JUST REMOVING THAT PROFESSOR

02:32:28.373 --> 02:32:30.675 region:rollup2
WHICH WE'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER

02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:32.110 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND THEN THEY GO SOMEWHERE

02:32:30.675 --> 02:32:33.511 region:rollup2
ELSE JUSTICE YOU SEEN IN THE

02:32:32.110 --> 02:32:35.647 region:rollup2
CATHOLIC CHURCH AND WITH PRIESTS

02:32:33.511 --> 02:32:37.115 region:rollup2
AND OTHERWISE. IT DOESN'T SOLVE

02:32:35.647 --> 02:32:39.417 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM SOCIETAL PROBLEM

02:32:37.115 --> 02:32:41.052 region:rollup2
SO PREVENTION IS THE BEST

02:32:39.417 --> 02:32:42.553 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE TO BOTH HAVE A

02:32:41.052 --> 02:32:44.122 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARY AND RESTORATIVE

02:32:42.553 --> 02:32:46.524 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT RECONNECT

02:32:44.122 --> 02:32:48.493 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON. TO SOME COMMUNITY

02:32:46.524 --> 02:32:50.461 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN START

02:32:48.493 --> 02:32:52.063 region:rollup2
TO BEHAVE IN A NORMALIZED

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:53.498 region:rollup2
FASHION THEN YOU WILL BE

02:32:52.063 --> 02:32:55.466 region:rollup2
FIGHTING THIS FIGHT AND YOU WILL

02:32:53.498 --> 02:32:56.534 region:rollup2
BE PUTTING MORE. YOUNG PEOPLE AT

02:32:55.466 --> 02:32:57.969 region:rollup2
RISK OR PEOPLE AT RISK IN

02:32:56.534 --> 02:32:59.771 region:rollup2
GENERAL AND THIS ALSO VICTIM

02:32:57.969 --> 02:33:01.239 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT CAN HAPPEN TO THE

02:32:59.771 --> 02:33:02.507 region:rollup2
LATE SEVENTIES.

02:33:01.239 --> 02:33:04.409 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT WASN'T UNTIL VINCE IN

02:33:02.507 --> 02:33:05.810 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER CASES THAT YOU BREAK

02:33:04.409 --> 02:33:07.311 region:rollup2
SHOULD LAWS REPLIED SEXUAL

02:33:05.810 --> 02:33:08.613 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT WERE YOU COULD ARGUE

02:33:07.311 --> 02:33:09.881 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEONE WAS DRESSED.

02:33:08.613 --> 02:33:11.215 region:rollup2
BASICALLY WAS THE BASIS OF WHY

02:33:09.881 --> 02:33:12.650 region:rollup2
YOU COULD OF ASSAULT SOMEONE YOU

02:33:11.215 --> 02:33:14.052 region:rollup2
NEED TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO COME

02:33:12.650 --> 02:33:15.686 region:rollup2
FORWARD BECAUSE IT TAKES A

02:33:14.052 --> 02:33:16.921 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COURAGE.

02:33:15.686 --> 02:33:18.389 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT

02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:19.924 region:rollup2
IN IN THE MIX

02:33:18.389 --> 02:33:21.392 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON

02:33:19.924 --> 02:33:22.894 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING THOSE TO COME COME

02:33:21.392 --> 02:33:24.395 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND ENCOURAGING THEM

02:33:22.894 --> 02:33:26.130 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE PUSH BACK TECHNOLOGY

02:33:24.395 --> 02:33:27.265 region:rollup2
THEY GET SOMETHING BACK. THAT'S

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:28.1000 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO SEE THE NUMBERS

02:33:27.265 --> 02:33:31.035 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE THAT

02:33:28.1000 --> 02:33:32.236 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE LATELY.

02:33:31.035 --> 02:33:33.037 region:rollup2
LET'S LET'S NOT FORGET THAT WITH

02:33:32.236 --> 02:33:33.838 region:rollup2
THE EXCEPTION OF INTERNS AND

02:33:33.037 --> 02:33:35.707 region:rollup2
FOLLOWS.

02:33:33.838 --> 02:33:37.141 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT.

02:33:35.707 --> 02:33:39.377 region:rollup2
EXACTLY LIKE BROUGH.

02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:41.412 region:rollup2
FACULTY AND STUDENTS.

02:33:39.377 --> 02:33:42.080 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF

02:33:41.412 --> 02:33:44.015 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE THAT ARE MARRIED

02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:46.184 region:rollup2
TO STAFFERS.

02:33:44.015 --> 02:33:47.985 region:rollup2
I'M OWE WHO START OUT IS CO

02:33:46.184 --> 02:33:48.519 region:rollup2
EQUAL STAFFERS AND SOMEBODY GETS

02:33:47.985 --> 02:33:49.921 region:rollup2
ELECTED OR SOMEBODY GETS A

02:33:48.519 --> 02:33:53.091 region:rollup2
PROMOTION.

02:33:49.921 --> 02:33:55.493 region:rollup2
SO EVEN THOUGH IT ANTI NEPOTISM.

02:33:53.091 --> 02:33:55.693 region:rollup2
OR CO HABITATION AYE OR WHAT IS

02:33:55.493 --> 02:33:56.494 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:33:55.693 --> 02:33:58.729 region:rollup2
WHICH THE TERM.

02:33:56.494 --> 02:33:59.097 region:rollup2
.

02:33:58.729 --> 02:34:00.865 region:rollup2
YEAH.

02:33:59.097 --> 02:34:03.067 region:rollup2
POLICIES IN WE SHOULD DISCUSS

02:34:00.865 --> 02:34:04.435 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE

02:34:03.067 --> 02:34:05.937 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO THAT

02:34:04.435 --> 02:34:08.072 region:rollup2
WHILE YOU DON'T WANT THE. YOU

02:34:05.937 --> 02:34:11.142 region:rollup2
KNOW CREEPY LEGISLATOR ASKING

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:12.744 region:rollup2
OUT YEAH. COULD.

02:34:11.142 --> 02:34:14.312 region:rollup2
NOT NOT SAY ANY NAMES BY THE WAY

02:34:12.744 --> 02:34:15.680 region:rollup2
HAS ALSO YOU ALSO DON'T WANT

02:34:14.312 --> 02:34:16.881 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT HAVE LEGITIMATE

02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:18.149 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS HAVING TO HIDE

02:34:16.881 --> 02:34:19.917 region:rollup2
THEM FOR FEAR OF SOMEBODY LOSING

02:34:18.149 --> 02:34:21.319 region:rollup2
THEIR ALL THE ICE. SO IT'S A

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:22.286 region:rollup2
LITTLE TRICKIER THAN IN THE CASE

02:34:21.319 --> 02:34:23.955 region:rollup2
WITH FACULTY RIGHT REALLY

02:34:22.286 --> 02:34:25.123 region:rollup2
GETTING IS A BRIGHT LINE. WE

02:34:23.955 --> 02:34:25.923 region:rollup2
DON'T OF THE LUXURY OF THAT

02:34:25.123 --> 02:34:27.125 region:rollup2
BRIGHT LINE WITH SOME OF THESE

02:34:25.923 --> 02:34:28.626 region:rollup2
ISSUES HERE AT GOOGLE AND

02:34:27.125 --> 02:34:29.761 region:rollup2
FACEBOOK JUST PUT A POLICY IN

02:34:28.626 --> 02:34:32.730 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN ASK SOMEBODY AT

02:34:29.761 --> 02:34:34.165 region:rollup2
ONCE AND IF THEY SAY. NO THAT'S

02:34:32.730 --> 02:34:35.266 region:rollup2
THAT BIT THAT YOU HAVE A ONE

02:34:34.165 --> 02:34:37.435 region:rollup2
YEAR ONE STRIKE AND YOU'RE OUT

02:34:35.266 --> 02:34:38.703 region:rollup2
POLICY DOES NOT REALIZE THAT

02:34:37.435 --> 02:34:39.303 region:rollup2
SOME.

02:34:38.703 --> 02:34:40.505 region:rollup2
HOLLYWOOD I WAS A DEVELOPMENT

02:34:39.303 --> 02:34:43.207 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE I WILL HAVE TO REWRITE

CHASED IS IS THE. IS THE FIFTH

02:34:52.116 --> 02:34:53.951 region:rollup2

TEND TO MEET THE PEOPLE IN THE

02:35:23.714 --> 02:35:27.151 region:rollup2
CIRCLE OF WHERE WE'RE WORKING.

02:35:25.616 --> 02:35:28.186 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO

02:35:27.151 --> 02:35:29.053 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT WITH WITH THE VERY

02:35:28.186 --> 02:35:32.056 region:rollup2
NATURE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE

02:35:29.053 --> 02:35:34.992 region:rollup2
COMMITTED.

02:41:47.264 --> 02:41:50.167 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

02:41:48.265 --> 02:41:50.834 region:rollup2
FEDERAL CONSENT DECREE CASE

02:41:50.167 --> 02:41:52.836 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF

02:41:50.834 --> 02:41:54.405 region:rollup2
THAT CASE.

02:41:52.836 --> 02:41:55.940 region:rollup2
WAS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:41:54.405 --> 02:41:57.708 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT

02:41:55.940 --> 02:42:00.010 region:rollup2
POLICY.

02:41:57.708 --> 02:42:02.646 region:rollup2
I WAS THE LEAD COUNTY COUNCIL

02:42:00.010 --> 02:42:04.415 region:rollup2
ON THE CASE THE TIME. AND MYSELF

02:42:02.646 --> 02:42:07.051 region:rollup2
IN A GROUP OF A SUBJECT MATTER

02:42:04.415 --> 02:42:09.320 region:rollup2
EXPERTS OUTSIDE COUNSEL SPENT

02:42:07.051 --> 02:42:11.922 region:rollup2
ABOUT. SIX MONTHS.

02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:13.724 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING WHAT WE NOW REFER TO

02:42:11.922 --> 02:42:15.893 region:rollup2
AS THE COUNTY POLICY OF EQUITY.

02:42:13.724 --> 02:42:17.394 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THOUGHT AND

02:42:15.893 --> 02:42:19.930 region:rollup2
DELIBERATION WENT INTO THIS

02:42:17.394 --> 02:42:21.632 region:rollup2
MODEL. AND I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT

02:42:19.930 --> 02:42:23.367 region:rollup2
FOR ANY MODEL.

02:42:21.632 --> 02:42:25.436 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIME AND CONSIDERATION

02:42:23.367 --> 02:42:27.237 region:rollup2
MUST BE PUT FORTH IN ORDER TO

02:42:25.436 --> 02:42:29.206 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE YOU GET A MODEL THAT

02:42:27.237 --> 02:42:30.774 region:rollup2
WORKS FOR YOUR CULTURE.

02:42:29.206 --> 02:42:32.576 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT YOU'VE

02:42:30.774 --> 02:42:34.645 region:rollup2
BEEN TALKING TODAY A LOT ABOUT

02:42:32.576 --> 02:42:36.614 region:rollup2
CULTURE CHANGE THAT IS EXACTLY

02:42:34.645 --> 02:42:38.148 region:rollup2
WHAT IS AT ISSUE HERE.

02:42:36.614 --> 02:42:39.216 region:rollup2
UP IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

02:42:38.148 --> 02:42:41.118 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS WAS

02:42:39.216 --> 02:42:43.087 region:rollup2
NOT A EASY CULTURE TO CHANGE

02:42:41.118 --> 02:42:44.922 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE THOUSAND. SWAT YOU

02:42:43.087 --> 02:42:48.192 region:rollup2
KNOW EMPLOYEES.

02:42:44.922 --> 02:42:49.260 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN THOUSAND SWORN OFFICERS

02:42:48.192 --> 02:42:51.328 region:rollup2
UP UNDER A FEDERAL CONSENT

02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:53.063 region:rollup2
DECREE.

02:42:51.328 --> 02:42:55.666 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS STILL RESISTED.

02:42:53.063 --> 02:42:57.334 region:rollup2
I AND IT TOOK A COUPLE YEARS

02:42:55.666 --> 02:42:59.036 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE STARTED TO SEE A

02:42:57.334 --> 02:43:01.639 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN THAT CULTURE.

02:42:59.036 --> 02:43:04.274 region:rollup2
BUT THE CULTURE DID CHANGE.

02:43:01.639 --> 02:43:06.877 region:rollup2
AND TODAY IT'S A CULTURE WHERE

02:43:04.274 --> 02:43:09.780 region:rollup2
REPORTING IS THE NORM.

02:43:06.877 --> 02:43:10.314 region:rollup2
SO THAT CULTURE BUT CHANGE WAS

02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:12.282 region:rollup2
NOT LOST ON OUR BOARD OF

02:43:10.314 --> 02:43:13.951 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS.

02:43:12.282 --> 02:43:15.052 region:rollup2
AND IT WORKED SO WELL IN THE

02:43:13.951 --> 02:43:16.353 region:rollup2
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND BROUGHT

02:43:15.052 --> 02:43:17.688 region:rollup2
THEM INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE

02:43:16.353 --> 02:43:19.290 region:rollup2
FEDERAL CONSENT DECREE WHICH IS

02:43:17.688 --> 02:43:22.126 region:rollup2
NO SMALL TASK.

02:43:19.290 --> 02:43:24.328 region:rollup2
THAT OUR BOARD WANTED IT TO BE

02:43:22.126 --> 02:43:26.730 region:rollup2
A COUNTY WIDE MODEL.

02:43:24.328 --> 02:43:28.432 region:rollup2
SO BEGINNING IN TWENTY ELEVEN.

02:43:26.730 --> 02:43:30.601 region:rollup2
MYSELF IN A GROUP OF PEOPLE

02:43:28.432 --> 02:43:32.670 region:rollup2
WERE ASKED TO TURN IT INTO A

02:43:30.601 --> 02:43:34.505 region:rollup2
COUNTY WIDE MODEL. OUT WHICH WE

02:43:32.670 --> 02:43:36.006 region:rollup2
DID AND AGAIN WE SPENT SIX

02:43:34.505 --> 02:43:37.841 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

02:43:36.006 --> 02:43:39.910 region:rollup2
IN YOU KNOW WITH A SMALL GROUP

02:43:37.841 --> 02:43:41.979 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE WORKING IN. AND OUT IN

02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:44.114 region:rollup2
A WAR ROOM TYPE ATMOSPHERE

02:43:41.979 --> 02:43:45.716 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING WHAT IT DOWN THE

02:43:44.114 --> 02:43:47.785 region:rollup2
COUNTY POST YOU'VE EQUITY.

02:43:45.716 --> 02:43:49.486 region:rollup2
SO GIVEN THE LATE HOUR I'M JUST

02:43:47.785 --> 02:43:51.188 region:rollup2
TO TOUCH ON OF PUBLIC

02:43:49.486 --> 02:43:52.756 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS.

02:43:51.188 --> 02:43:54.591 region:rollup2
OF THE COUNTY POLICY OF EQUITY

02:43:52.756 --> 02:43:56.093 region:rollup2
WHICH WE BELIEVE MAKE IT THE

02:43:54.591 --> 02:43:57.327 region:rollup2
BEST MODEL AND DISTINGUISH IT

02:43:56.093 --> 02:43:59.730 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER MODELS.

02:43:57.327 --> 02:44:00.664 region:rollup2
.

02:43:59.730 --> 02:44:02.232 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THING THE POLICY

02:44:00.664 --> 02:44:04.168 region:rollup2
ITSELF

02:44:02.232 --> 02:44:06.470 region:rollup2
MOST HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION

02:44:04.168 --> 02:44:07.404 region:rollup2
RETALIATION POLICIES.

02:44:06.470 --> 02:44:09.206 region:rollup2
START WITH HARASSMENT

02:44:07.404 --> 02:44:11.275 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION.

02:44:09.206 --> 02:44:12.810 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTY WHAT WE DID IS WE

02:44:11.275 --> 02:44:15.079 region:rollup2
ADDED HADN'T AN ADDITIONAL

02:44:12.810 --> 02:44:16.680 region:rollup2
STANDARD. AND THAT STANDARD IS

02:44:15.079 --> 02:44:19.283 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT TOWARDS

02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:20.451 region:rollup2
OTHERS BASIN A PROTECTED CLASS

02:44:19.283 --> 02:44:21.685 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE POLICY THAT

02:44:20.451 --> 02:44:23.120 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES MORE THAN SEXUAL

02:44:21.685 --> 02:44:24.722 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT ADDRESSES ALL THE

02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:26.156 region:rollup2
PROTECTED CLASSES. AND I WOULD

02:44:24.722 --> 02:44:27.458 region:rollup2
SUMMIT ANY.

02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:29.360 region:rollup2
IF YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO THE

02:44:27.458 --> 02:44:31.228 region:rollup2
EXERCISE OF PUTTING IN PLACE A

02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:32.029 region:rollup2
NEW MECHANISM YOU MIGHT AS WELL

02:44:31.228 --> 02:44:33.964 region:rollup2
JUST ADDRESS ALL PROTECTED

02:44:32.029 --> 02:44:34.698 region:rollup2
CLASSES BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY

02:44:33.964 --> 02:44:36.533 region:rollup2
THE BEST PRACTICE IN TODAY'S.

02:44:34.698 --> 02:44:38.435 region:rollup2
TODAY'S WORLD.

02:44:36.533 --> 02:44:40.270 region:rollup2
SO THIS INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT

02:44:38.435 --> 02:44:42.339 region:rollup2
TOWARD OTHER STANDARD BASED IN A

02:44:40.270 --> 02:44:45.075 region:rollup2
PROTECTED CLASS IT REQUIRES MUCH

02:44:42.339 --> 02:44:46.143 region:rollup2
LESS THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED TO

02:44:45.075 --> 02:44:47.778 region:rollup2
VIOLATE HARASSMENT OR

02:44:46.143 --> 02:44:49.747 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION POLICY. FOR

02:44:47.778 --> 02:44:51.648 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE INAPPROPRIATE

02:44:49.747 --> 02:44:54.051 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE NEED

02:44:51.648 --> 02:44:56.286 region:rollup2
NOT BE SEVERE OR PERVASIVE OR

02:44:54.051 --> 02:44:57.988 region:rollup2
UNWELCOME OR INTENTIONAL TO

02:44:56.286 --> 02:44:59.089 region:rollup2
VIOLATE THE COUNTIES POLICY OF

02:44:57.988 --> 02:45:00.924 region:rollup2
EQUITY. IT CAN JUST BE

02:44:59.089 --> 02:45:02.526 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE BUT IT HAS TO BE

02:45:00.924 --> 02:45:03.527 region:rollup2
TETHERED TO ONE OF THE PROTECTED

02:45:02.526 --> 02:45:06.330 region:rollup2
CLASSES

02:45:03.527 --> 02:45:08.565 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE AN INAPPROPRIATE

02:45:06.330 --> 02:45:10.667 region:rollup2
JOKE ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR

02:45:08.565 --> 02:45:13.137 region:rollup2
RACE OR SEX OR RELIGION. MAY

02:45:10.667 --> 02:45:15.272 region:rollup2
TRIGGER A POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF

02:45:13.137 --> 02:45:16.807 region:rollup2
OUR POLICY. AND RESULT IN A

02:45:15.272 --> 02:45:18.675 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT BEING FILED AN

02:45:16.807 --> 02:45:19.777 region:rollup2

02:45:18.675 --> 02:45:21.178 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE ACTION YOU KNOW

02:45:19.777 --> 02:45:23.580 region:rollup2
BEING TAKEN.

02:45:21.178 --> 02:45:24.248 region:rollup2
WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THAT

02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:26.216 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S WORK SO WELL IN THE

02:45:24.248 --> 02:45:28.552 region:rollup2
COUNTY. IT'S BECAUSE THE

02:45:26.216 --> 02:45:30.087 region:rollup2
STANDARD IS LOWER THE EMPLOYERS

02:45:28.552 --> 02:45:32.923 region:rollup2
PUT ON NOTICE OF INAPPROPRIATE

02:45:30.087 --> 02:45:34.525 region:rollup2

DISCRIMINATION. YOU'RE ABLE TO

02:45:34.525 --> 02:45:39.096 region:rollup2
INTERVENE EARLY AND CORRECT IT

02:45:37.094 --> 02:45:41.165 region:rollup2
AND THAT RESULTS IN OFTEN FOLKS

02:45:39.096 --> 02:45:42.866 region:rollup2
NOT LOSING THEIR JOB BUT INSTEAD

02:45:41.165 --> 02:45:44.201 region:rollup2
MAY BE RECEIVING COUNSELING OR

WRITTEN REPRIMAND OR SOMETHING

02:45:44.201 --> 02:45:48.038 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT. WHICH IS REALLY THE

02:45:45.969 --> 02:45:49.640 region:rollup2
CULTURE YOU WANT. YOU DON'T WANT

02:45:48.038 --> 02:45:50.741 region:rollup2
THAT IF THE CONDUCT IS SEVERE

02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:52.376 region:rollup2
ENOUGH OF COURSE THAT MAY RESULT

02:45:50.741 --> 02:45:54.778 region:rollup2
IN SOME BE LOSING THEIR JOB BUT

02:45:52.376 --> 02:45:55.312 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT WERE ABLE

02:45:54.778 --> 02:45:56.213 region:rollup2
TO GET AT THE CONDUCT MUCH

02:45:55.312 --> 02:45:57.714 region:rollup2
SOONER.

02:45:56.213 --> 02:45:59.316 region:rollup2
AND OUR CULTURE IS ONE THAT

02:45:57.714 --> 02:46:00.951 region:rollup2
INSISTS THAT SUPPORTS FILING

02:45:59.316 --> 02:46:02.252 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS

02:46:00.951 --> 02:46:03.453 region:rollup2
WE WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:46:02.252 --> 02:46:05.389 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IN THE COUNTY OF LOS

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:06.824 region:rollup2

A YEAR.

02:46:08.025 --> 02:46:10.060 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M

02:46:09.059 --> 02:46:12.196 region:rollup2
OFTEN ASKED ABOUT WHEN THEY

02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:13.463 region:rollup2
DISCUSS OUR POLICY SOME FOLKS

02:46:12.196 --> 02:46:14.364 region:rollup2

IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS

02:46:14.364 --> 02:46:17.634 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS

02:46:15.666 --> 02:46:19.303 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT IT IF YOU

02:46:17.634 --> 02:46:20.704 region:rollup2
HAVE NO COMPLAINTS YOU HAVE A

02:46:19.303 --> 02:46:22.172 region:rollup2
LOT PROBLEMS IF YOU HAVE SIX

02:46:20.704 --> 02:46:23.774 region:rollup2
THOUSAND COMPLAINTS YOU'VE GOT A

02:46:22.172 --> 02:46:26.109 region:rollup2
HEALTHY WORKPLACE WHERE PEOPLE

FEEL SAFE. TO COME FORWARD AND

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:28.812 region:rollup2
COMPLAIN AND THAT'S THE MODEL

02:46:28.312 --> 02:46:30.948 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO KIND OF MOVE

02:46:28.812 --> 02:46:32.216 region:rollup2
TOWARDS.

02:46:30.948 --> 02:46:35.319 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CRITICAL.

02:46:32.216 --> 02:46:37.054 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO ANY

NEW POLICY THAT YOU ROLL OUT IS

02:46:37.054 --> 02:46:41.892 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MUST EDUCATE BEHIND IT

02:46:39.456 --> 02:46:43.727 region:rollup2
YOU MUST HAVE A ROBUST EDUCATION

02:46:41.892 --> 02:46:45.629 region:rollup2
ARM WHEN YOU INTRODUCE NEW

02:46:43.727 --> 02:46:48.232 region:rollup2

DEPARTMENTS GO TO IMPLICIT BIAS

02:46:55.272 --> 02:46:59.710 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND THAT SORT OF.

02:46:57.507 --> 02:47:02.112 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO EDUCATING THE

02:46:59.710 --> 02:47:03.013 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE IS REQUIRED FOR

02:47:02.112 --> 02:47:04.214 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO BE

02:47:03.013 --> 02:47:07.050 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE HAVE TO

02:47:04.214 --> 02:47:07.851 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT'S A NEW DAY.

02:47:07.050 --> 02:47:10.654 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK IT'S

02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:12.823 region:rollup2
FUNNY. A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT. AND

02:47:10.654 --> 02:47:15.592 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO EDUCATE AND YOU

02:47:12.823 --> 02:47:17.394 region:rollup2
CAN'T DISMISS THAT CONCERN.

02:47:15.592 --> 02:47:19.796 region:rollup2
I MEAN FAIR ENOUGH

02:47:17.394 --> 02:47:21.765 region:rollup2
FOR FOLKS TO THINK YOU MEAN I

02:47:19.796 --> 02:47:23.967 region:rollup2
CAN'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. AND THEY

02:47:21.765 --> 02:47:25.636 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE TRAINED THAT'S RIGHT

02:47:23.967 --> 02:47:27.905 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ANYMORE A

02:47:25.636 --> 02:47:29.606 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THAT TAKES SOME TIME

02:47:27.905 --> 02:47:32.309 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE INTRODUCE THE COUNTY

02:47:29.606 --> 02:47:34.444 region:rollup2
POLICY OF EQUITY WE SPENT THAT

02:47:32.309 --> 02:47:37.648 region:rollup2

DIFFERENT

02:47:42.252 --> 02:47:45.422 region:rollup2
THEN THE REST OF THE WORKFORCE

02:47:43.921 --> 02:47:48.292 region:rollup2
IN THE LONG CALIFORNIA REQUIRES

02:47:45.422 --> 02:47:50.294 region:rollup2
THAT. SUPERVISORS MUST HAVE A

02:47:48.292 --> 02:47:52.396 region:rollup2
MUST BE TRAINED DIFFERENTLY IN

02:47:50.294 --> 02:47:54.164 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THEIR ROLE IS WHAT

02:47:52.396 --> 02:47:55.866 region:rollup2
THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AND

02:47:54.164 --> 02:47:58.402 region:rollup2
WHAT THE LIABILITIES FOR THE

02:47:55.866 --> 02:47:59.903 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER IF THEY FAIL TO ACT.

02:47:58.402 --> 02:48:01.605 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA IF A

02:47:59.903 --> 02:48:03.507 region:rollup2

02:48:03.507 --> 02:48:07.644 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER YOU DON'T HAVE A

02:48:05.208 --> 02:48:09.579 region:rollup2
DEFENSE YOU'RE LIABLE. SO THEY

02:48:07.644 --> 02:48:10.514 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE EDUCATED IN THAT.

02:48:09.579 --> 02:48:12.549 region:rollup2
ANOTHER KEY.

02:48:10.514 --> 02:48:15.018 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BETWEEN.

02:48:12.549 --> 02:48:17.354 region:rollup2
ABOUT OUR POLICY IS THAT WE

02:48:15.018 --> 02:48:19.356 region:rollup2
HAVE A CENTRALIZED INTAKE UNIT.

02:48:17.354 --> 02:48:21.692 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO BARRIER TO FILING A

02:48:19.356 --> 02:48:22.259 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT UNDER A POLICY OF

02:48:21.692 --> 02:48:24.127 region:rollup2

BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE

GO TO THEIR BOSS WITH THEIR HR

02:48:49.286 --> 02:48:52.689 region:rollup2

COMPLAINTS COMING ONLINE.

02:49:38.535 --> 02:49:41.805 region:rollup2

GETS AN INITIAL INVESTIGATION.

02:49:47.177 --> 02:49:50.180 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

02:49:48.645 --> 02:49:52.416 region:rollup2
OFTEN THE COMPLAINING PARTY IS

02:49:50.180 --> 02:49:54.584 region:rollup2

EVIDENCE IN THE INTAKE UNIT THEN

02:50:01.158 --> 02:50:04.895 region:rollup2
MAKES AN ASSESSMENT WHETHER

BASED ON THAT INITIAL COMPLAINT

02:50:04.895 --> 02:50:07.798 region:rollup2

THE POLICY OR NOT.

02:50:07.798 --> 02:50:11.401 region:rollup2
IF THEY DETERMINE THEIR REYES

02:50:10.634 --> 02:50:12.803 region:rollup2
THEN IT GOES FOR FURTHER

02:50:11.401 --> 02:50:14.337 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION

02:50:12.803 --> 02:50:15.505 region:rollup2
AND THE FURTHER INVESTIGATION

02:50:14.337 --> 02:50:17.474 region:rollup2
INVOLVES INTERVIEWING THE

02:50:15.505 --> 02:50:18.608 region:rollup2

TO BOTH SIDES OF THIS EQUATION.

02:50:23.847 --> 02:50:27.617 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST NOT APPROPRIATE TO

HEAR A BASE A DECISION ON ONE

02:50:27.617 --> 02:50:30.320 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THE STORY YOU HAVE TO

THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

02:50:32.255 --> 02:50:35.659 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE COMPLAINTS THAT WHERE

.

02:50:43.066 --> 02:50:46.403 region:rollup2

THE INVESTIGATION BEFORE THAT

02:51:42.592 --> 02:51:45.028 region:rollup2
HEARINGS THAT THEY'RE

KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE FACTS.

02:51:45.028 --> 02:51:47.731 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S FABULOUS ABOUT THESE

02:51:46.530 --> 02:51:49.533 region:rollup2
HEARINGS IS THAT'S WHERE THE

02:51:47.731 --> 02:51:50.934 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE IN THE EDUCATION

02:51:49.533 --> 02:51:52.302 region:rollup2

INVOLVED DEPARTMENT MEMBERS.

02:51:56.706 --> 02:52:02.646 region:rollup2
WHY THIS CONDUCT VIOLATED OUR

02:52:00.510 --> 02:52:04.214 region:rollup2
POLICY AND THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:52:02.646 --> 02:52:05.715 region:rollup2
FOR FOLKS TO ASK QUESTIONS TO

02:52:04.214 --> 02:52:07.684 region:rollup2
PUSH BACK TO GET CLARIFICATION

02:52:05.715 --> 02:52:10.053 region:rollup2
ON BOTH SIDES?

02:52:07.684 --> 02:52:11.388 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE END OF THE PIANO

02:52:10.053 --> 02:52:12.956 region:rollup2
THEN MAKES A RECOMMENDATION TO

02:52:11.388 --> 02:52:14.124 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF WHAT THEY

02:52:12.956 --> 02:52:15.659 region:rollup2
THINK IF THE POLICIES AND

02:52:14.124 --> 02:52:16.259 region:rollup2
VIOLATE WHAT THEY THINK THE

02:52:15.659 --> 02:52:17.194 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINE SHOULD

02:52:16.259 --> 02:52:19.362 region:rollup2
BE.

02:52:17.194 --> 02:52:19.930 region:rollup2
AND NOT JUST GUIDED BY YOU KNOW

02:52:19.362 --> 02:52:21.832 region:rollup2
THE SEVERITY OF THE CONDUCT

02:52:19.930 --> 02:52:23.066 region:rollup2
INVOLVED. ULTIMATELY IT'S UP TO

02:52:21.832 --> 02:52:24.634 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT TO ACCEPT THE

02:52:23.066 --> 02:52:25.902 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION OR NOT.

02:52:24.634 --> 02:52:27.671 region:rollup2
NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME

02:52:25.902 --> 02:52:28.972 region:rollup2
THEY DO BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE

02:52:27.671 --> 02:52:31.875 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:52:28.972 --> 02:52:33.210 region:rollup2
SPENT IN IN.

02:52:31.875 --> 02:52:35.345 region:rollup2
COMING FORWARD OR SUBSTANTIATING

02:52:33.210 --> 02:52:37.847 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDATION

02:52:35.345 --> 02:52:38.882 region:rollup2
SO THAT HAS WORKED VERY WELL.

02:52:37.847 --> 02:52:41.184 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DISTINGUISHING

02:52:38.882 --> 02:52:42.719 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS SUPERVISORS IN

02:52:41.184 --> 02:52:44.387 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

02:52:42.719 --> 02:52:45.956 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT SUPERVISORS THEY HAVE

02:52:44.387 --> 02:52:47.958 region:rollup2
AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY.

02:52:45.956 --> 02:52:50.026 region:rollup2
TO REPORT POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS

02:52:47.958 --> 02:52:52.229 region:rollup2
OF THE POLICY OF EQUITY.

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:53.763 region:rollup2
SO IF I'M A SUPERVISOR A MANAGER

02:52:52.229 --> 02:52:55.398 region:rollup2
AND I WITNESSED SOMETHING OR

02:52:53.763 --> 02:52:56.800 region:rollup2
FROM PUT ON NOTICE OF SOMETHING.

02:52:55.398 --> 02:52:57.400 region:rollup2
A POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF OUR

02:52:56.800 --> 02:52:59.369 region:rollup2
POLICY AND I FAILED TO REPORT

02:52:57.400 --> 02:53:01.738 region:rollup2
IT.

02:52:59.369 --> 02:53:02.272 region:rollup2
I MYSELF WILL BE SUBJECT TO

02:53:01.738 --> 02:53:03.340 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE FOR FAILURE TO

02:53:02.272 --> 02:53:03.873 region:rollup2
REPORT.

02:53:03.340 --> 02:53:05.108 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS WORKED LIKE A

02:53:03.873 --> 02:53:07.410 region:rollup2
CHARM.

02:53:05.108 --> 02:53:09.346 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:10.847 region:rollup2
IF A SUPERVISOR SEES SOMETHING

02:53:09.346 --> 02:53:12.449 region:rollup2
AND SWEEPS IT UNDER THE RUG AT

02:53:10.847 --> 02:53:14.217 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER IS LIABLE FOR THAT

02:53:12.449 --> 02:53:15.952 region:rollup2
CONDUCT SO WE WANTED TO MAKE OUR

02:53:14.217 --> 02:53:18.622 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVE

02:53:15.952 --> 02:53:19.389 region:rollup2
SOME SKIN IN THE GAME. AND.

02:53:18.622 --> 02:53:22.292 region:rollup2
AND IT'S WORKED VERY WELL.

02:53:19.389 --> 02:53:24.961 region:rollup2
.

02:53:22.292 --> 02:53:26.863 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS IN. THAT THAT I

02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:29.532 region:rollup2
WOULD RECOMMEND ANY BEST

02:53:26.863 --> 02:53:31.334 region:rollup2
PRACTICE MODEL MUST HAVE AN

02:53:29.532 --> 02:53:32.802 region:rollup2
HOUR'S HAS IS AN OPTION FOR

02:53:31.334 --> 02:53:34.804 region:rollup2

WOULD LIKE TO GO THROUGH IT IT'S

02:53:37.941 --> 02:53:41.745 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY. BUT IT GIVES ANOTHER

02:53:40.043 --> 02:53:43.880 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY TO BE

02:53:41.745 --> 02:53:46.016 region:rollup2

AND. FINALLY. I GUESS WHAT I

02:53:50.587 --> 02:53:53.523 region:rollup2
WOULD CONCLUDE WITH THERE ARE

02:53:52.055 --> 02:53:55.692 region:rollup2
TWO POINTS.

02:53:53.523 --> 02:53:58.328 region:rollup2
ONE IS NO MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL

02:53:55.692 --> 02:54:00.730 region:rollup2
YOUR MODEL IS.

02:53:58.328 --> 02:54:03.033 region:rollup2
IT WILL NEVER ELIMINATE. ALL

02:54:00.730 --> 02:54:03.667 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT OR INAPPROPRIATE

02:54:03.033 --> 02:54:04.868 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE I JUST

02:54:03.667 --> 02:54:06.269 region:rollup2
WANT.

02:54:04.868 --> 02:54:08.204 region:rollup2
BUT A WILL SIGNIFICANTLY

02:54:06.269 --> 02:54:10.640 region:rollup2
MITIGATED IN THE COUNTY OF LOS

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:12.609 region:rollup2
ANGELES WE'VE CUT OUR EMPLOYMENT

02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:14.177 region:rollup2
LITIGATION COSTS AS A RESULT OF

02:54:12.609 --> 02:54:15.779 region:rollup2
THIS MODEL IN HALF.

02:54:14.177 --> 02:54:17.614 region:rollup2
FROM THIRTY MILLION DOWN TO

02:54:15.779 --> 02:54:19.249 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN MILLION OCCASIONALLY AT

02:54:17.614 --> 02:54:21.017 region:rollup2
SPIKE'S WE HAVE A BAD CASE BUT

02:54:19.249 --> 02:54:22.619 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T ELIMINATED WE STILL

02:54:21.017 --> 02:54:24.087 region:rollup2
HAVE BAD CASES SOMETIMES PEOPLE

02:54:22.619 --> 02:54:25.622 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T COME FORWARD. BUT

02:54:24.087 --> 02:54:27.023 region:rollup2

THE CONDUCT.

02:54:29.626 --> 02:54:32.762 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY AS I'VE SAID

02:54:31.127 --> 02:54:34.064 region:rollup2
BEFORE BUT I'LL SAY AGAIN TO THE

02:54:32.762 --> 02:54:36.066 region:rollup2

ZONES.

02:54:41.037 --> 02:54:45.175 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MUST TAKE A MINUTE.

02:54:43.473 --> 02:54:47.010 region:rollup2

YOUR WORKPLACE THIS ISN'T

02:54:51.081 --> 02:54:53.984 region:rollup2
SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST SLAP

02:54:51.648 --> 02:54:56.586 region:rollup2

02:58:39.842 --> 02:58:42.812 region:rollup2
IS STUDENTS.

02:58:41.277 --> 02:58:44.113 region:rollup2
WE NEXT QUIRK TO CREATE A

02:58:42.812 --> 02:58:45.114 region:rollup2

CHOICES FOR HELP THEY COULD GO

02:58:51.821 --> 02:58:54.324 region:rollup2

02:58:54.324 --> 02:58:57.427 region:rollup2
TRAINED TITLE NINE OFFICER

02:58:55.491 --> 02:58:59.362 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCED FOR HOW.

02:58:57.427 --> 02:59:00.430 region:rollup2
IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO A GO TO

02:58:59.362 --> 02:59:02.365 region:rollup2
EITHER OF THOSE THEY DIDN'T

02:59:00.430 --> 02:59:03.766 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE A CHOICE.

02:59:02.365 --> 02:59:06.102 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THOSE RESOURCES HAVE

02:59:03.766 --> 02:59:07.637 region:rollup2
BEEN TRAINED PROVIDE A SUPPORT

02:59:06.102 --> 02:59:09.439 region:rollup2

AND STAFF AND FACULTY THAT HAVE

02:59:09.439 --> 02:59:12.875 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT. BUT.

02:59:11.641 --> 02:59:14.577 region:rollup2
THOSE FOLKS DID NOT HAVE THE

02:59:12.875 --> 02:59:16.446 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO BE ONE HUNDRED

02:59:14.577 --> 02:59:17.013 region:rollup2

02:59:16.446 --> 02:59:18.247 region:rollup2

PROGRAM.

02:59:18.247 --> 02:59:20.583 region:rollup2
WE STARTED OUT WITH THE IDEA

02:59:19.182 --> 02:59:22.018 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD APPOINT ONE OR TWO

02:59:20.583 --> 02:59:23.286 region:rollup2

02:59:24.854 --> 02:59:27.690 region:rollup2
WE QUICKLY LEARNED THAT THE LAW

02:59:26.122 --> 02:59:29.192 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO DO THAT

02:59:27.690 --> 02:59:30.693 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:59:29.192 --> 02:59:32.028 region:rollup2

SAY NINETY NINE POINT NINE

03:08:56.592 --> 03:08:59.461 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF WHAT THEY'RE DEALING

03:08:57.593 --> 03:09:00.930 region:rollup2
WITH OUR EMPLOYEES THAT WHEN

03:08:59.461 --> 03:09:02.431 region:rollup2
THEY MAKE THAT SHIFT DO YOU FEEL

03:09:00.930 --> 03:09:04.433 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S ENOUGH GUIDANCE FOR

03:09:02.431 --> 03:09:05.968 region:rollup2
THEM OR ENOUGH UNDERSTANDING OF

03:09:04.433 --> 03:09:07.903 region:rollup2

THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS.

03:09:10.339 --> 03:09:13.843 region:rollup2
ARE UNDER YOU KNOW IT'S WE'RE

03:09:12.074 --> 03:09:14.710 region:rollup2
NOT EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGISLATURE

03:09:13.843 --> 03:09:16.478 region:rollup2
WILL YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT

03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:17.112 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND AND KIND OF HOW

03:09:16.478 --> 03:09:18.447 region:rollup2
THAT ACCOUNTABILITY WOULD HAPPEN

03:09:17.112 --> 03:09:19.815 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD BE.

03:09:18.447 --> 03:09:23.018 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EITHER FOR THE VOTERS

03:09:19.815 --> 03:09:23.786 region:rollup2
OR FROM OUR COLLEAGUES YES SO DO

03:09:23.018 --> 03:09:25.888 region:rollup2
YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT IT

03:09:23.786 --> 03:09:28.157 region:rollup2
THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING

03:09:25.888 --> 03:09:30.793 region:rollup2
WITH THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT

03:09:28.157 --> 03:09:31.660 region:rollup2
THE SAME MODEL WOULD WORK WELL

03:09:30.793 --> 03:09:33.395 region:rollup2
ARGUED THAT THIS DROP ACTUAL

03:09:31.660 --> 03:09:33.963 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER

03:09:33.395 --> 03:09:34.597 region:rollup2
IF WE KIND OF WENT DOWN THAT

03:09:33.963 --> 03:09:36.265 region:rollup2
ROAD.

03:09:34.597 --> 03:09:37.600 region:rollup2
AND AND TRY TO PURSUE SETTING

03:09:36.265 --> 03:09:39.001 region:rollup2
UP A SIMILAR.

03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:40.269 region:rollup2
KIND OF OF PANEL TO DEAL WITH

03:09:39.001 --> 03:09:42.504 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE

03:09:40.269 --> 03:09:44.273 region:rollup2
I MEAN A IN MY EXPERIENCE NOW

KNOW A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

03:09:45.608 --> 03:09:48.677 region:rollup2
YEARS.

03:09:46.075 --> 03:09:49.812 region:rollup2
ARMADA WORKS LIKE A CHARM

03:09:48.677 --> 03:09:50.713 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE INVENTIVELY ON

03:09:49.812 --> 03:09:52.881 region:rollup2
PLANES AGAINST ELECTED PERSON OR

03:09:50.713 --> 03:09:54.516 region:rollup2
NOT I MEAN THIS IS AN AREA OF

03:09:52.881 --> 03:09:55.651 region:rollup2
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE THIS IS

03:09:54.516 --> 03:09:56.852 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT LAW.

03:09:55.651 --> 03:09:58.721 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE

03:09:56.852 --> 03:10:01.090 region:rollup2
LAWS WELL DEFINED.

03:09:58.721 --> 03:10:02.424 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW IT MAKES IT EASIER

03:10:01.090 --> 03:10:03.993 region:rollup2
AT THE ELECTIONS JUST SUBJECT

03:10:02.424 --> 03:10:05.661 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES TO THE POLICY WE

03:10:03.993 --> 03:10:07.029 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THE ANALYSIS

03:10:05.661 --> 03:10:09.131 region:rollup2
ON WHETHER THEY'RE. YOU KNOW

03:10:07.029 --> 03:10:10.1000 region:rollup2
WHEN EMPLOYEE ARE NOT THEY JUST

03:10:09.131 --> 03:10:12.601 region:rollup2
PUT THEMSELVES INTO THE PROCESS

03:10:10.1000 --> 03:10:15.537 region:rollup2
BUT THAT ANALYSIS COULD BE DONE.

03:10:12.601 --> 03:10:18.374 region:rollup2
AND I MEAN THIS IS A WORKPLACE.

03:10:15.537 --> 03:10:20.576 region:rollup2
IN IN TODAY'S CLIMATE I WOULD.

03:10:18.374 --> 03:10:23.112 region:rollup2
SUGGEST MOST ELECTED MAY WANT TO

03:10:20.576 --> 03:10:24.713 region:rollup2
SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THIS MODEL

03:10:23.112 --> 03:10:28.083 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THEY

03:10:24.713 --> 03:10:30.753 region:rollup2
FEAR FEEL AND THAT WE DELIVER.

03:10:28.083 --> 03:10:32.454 region:rollup2
FAIR OBJECTIVE MODEL.

03:10:30.753 --> 03:10:34.790 region:rollup2
OUT WHERE THE INVESTIGATIONS OF

03:10:32.454 --> 03:10:37.893 region:rollup2

I AND THAT IT'S FAIR.

03:10:39.762 --> 03:10:44.900 region:rollup2
AND THE YOU KNOW. OVERSIGHT IS A

03:10:42.464 --> 03:10:46.835 region:rollup2
BIG WORLD A BIG WORD OUR EQUITY

03:10:44.900 --> 03:10:48.570 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT PIANO IT'S REALLY JUST

03:10:46.835 --> 03:10:50.172 region:rollup2
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHO COME

03:10:48.570 --> 03:10:52.241 region:rollup2
IN AND LOOK AT THE WORK PRODUCT

03:10:50.172 --> 03:10:53.876 region:rollup2
AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO.

03:10:52.241 --> 03:10:54.476 region:rollup2
A BACK TO THE COUNTY A WHAT THE

03:10:53.876 --> 03:10:55.144 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED DISCIPLINE SHOULD

03:10:54.476 --> 03:10:56.679 region:rollup2
BE.

03:10:55.144 --> 03:10:59.481 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT OVERSIGHT IN LIGHT THE

03:10:56.679 --> 03:11:00.249 region:rollup2
FTP SEE SENSE OF OVERSIGHT.

03:10:59.481 --> 03:11:03.752 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT

03:11:00.249 --> 03:11:05.421 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE AS OF. A AN EMPLOYEE.

03:11:03.752 --> 03:11:08.290 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE YOU KNOW CAN LOOK

03:11:05.421 --> 03:11:10.292 region:rollup2
LIKE A SUSPENSION OR TRAINING

03:11:08.290 --> 03:11:11.927 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD TYPICALLY LOOK LIKE.

03:11:10.292 --> 03:11:12.928 region:rollup2
IN THIS MODEL FOR ELECTED

03:11:11.927 --> 03:11:14.330 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS SOMETHING SHORT OF

03:11:12.928 --> 03:11:16.899 region:rollup2
REMOVING FROM OFFICE WHAT OTHER

03:11:14.330 --> 03:11:17.866 region:rollup2
TYPES OF. OF DISCIPLINE.

03:11:16.899 --> 03:11:19.301 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WOULD YOU SEE

03:11:17.866 --> 03:11:20.502 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED THEM OVERALL

03:11:19.301 --> 03:11:22.404 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING AND IF THEY'RE

03:11:20.502 --> 03:11:23.439 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING WHO IN OUR MODEL

03:11:22.404 --> 03:11:24.907 region:rollup2
WOULD THEY RECOMMEND TO IF ANY

03:11:23.439 --> 03:11:25.874 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS OF HOW HOW DOES THAT

03:11:24.907 --> 03:11:28.043 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THE COUNTY.

03:11:25.874 --> 03:11:29.878 region:rollup2
I AM IN THE MODEL FOR ELECTED

03:11:28.043 --> 03:11:31.413 region:rollup2
THE WRECK OF DEPENDING ON YOU

03:11:29.878 --> 03:11:33.315 region:rollup2
KNOW THE SEVERITY AND THE

03:11:31.413 --> 03:11:35.084 region:rollup2
FREQUENCY AND I AND ALL OF THAT

03:11:33.315 --> 03:11:37.419 region:rollup2
BUT IF IT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU

03:11:35.084 --> 03:11:38.988 region:rollup2
KNOW SOMEWHAT INNOCENT.

03:11:37.419 --> 03:11:39.922 region:rollup2
I IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS MEN

03:11:38.988 --> 03:11:42.558 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE RECOMMENDED

03:11:39.922 --> 03:11:44.159 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE COULD BE. COUNSELING

03:11:42.558 --> 03:11:45.794 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE MEDIATION.

03:11:44.159 --> 03:11:47.529 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT YOU KNOW AND WE'RE

03:11:45.794 --> 03:11:49.665 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF THE NEED TO KEEP

03:11:47.529 --> 03:11:51.700 region:rollup2
THINGS CONFIDENTIAL IT WE VIEW

03:11:49.665 --> 03:11:52.201 region:rollup2
IT AS A PERSONNEL MATTER AND

03:11:51.700 --> 03:11:53.135 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO

03:11:52.201 --> 03:11:54.770 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY.

03:11:53.135 --> 03:11:56.905 region:rollup2
AND WE GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO

03:11:54.770 --> 03:11:58.240 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM THAT AND PROTECT THEM.

03:11:56.905 --> 03:12:00.843 region:rollup2
AYE AND IT'S YET THE DEPARTMENT

HEAD LEVEL AT AT AT THE ELECTED

03:12:00.843 --> 03:12:03.379 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

03:12:01.677 --> 03:12:04.480 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S HOW WE'VE HANDLED IT

03:12:03.379 --> 03:12:06.515 region:rollup2
AND IT'S

03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:09.151 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S RARE.

03:12:06.515 --> 03:12:11.420 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS AT THAT LEVEL BUT IT

03:12:09.151 --> 03:12:13.188 region:rollup2
HAS THE IT MAY BE AT THAT LEVEL

03:12:11.420 --> 03:12:14.890 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE HANDLED IT I BELIEVE

03:12:13.188 --> 03:12:16.225 region:rollup2
WELL AT THAT LEVEL.

03:12:14.890 --> 03:12:17.426 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE WHO THE

03:12:16.225 --> 03:12:19.495 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS BEING MADE TO

03:12:22.197 --> 03:12:27.236 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON WHO'S INVOLVED AND IT

03:12:24.366 --> 03:12:28.771 region:rollup2
MAY. DEPENDING ON THAT AND MAY
