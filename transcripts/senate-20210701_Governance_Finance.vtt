ALL- AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL- I

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:48.540
DO AGREE WITH- WITH C. SACK

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:51.643
THAT WE'RE LONG PAST TO TAKE A

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.178
BROADER LOOK AT THE BROWN ACT

00:21:53.245 --> 00:21:56.014
AND HOW IT CAN BE MODERNIZED ON

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:59.985
HAVING SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS-

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:01.219
ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:02.087
SAN FRANCISCO SUBJECT THE

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.955
PRODUCT ARE MANY GOOD THINGS IN

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:05.724
THE BROWN ACT BUT BUT IT WAS

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:07.526
DEFINITELY WRITTEN. IN A

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:10.162
DIFFERENT ERA AND I THINK OUR-

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:12.164
REPRESENTATIVES HE SACKED-

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.032
REYES SOME EXAMPLES OF WAYS

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:15.367
WHERE THE PRODUCT IS JUST WAY

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.569
OUT OF DATE AND WE MAKE A VERY

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:19.905
VERY HARD AT TIMES FOR LOCAL

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:22.307
GOVERNMENTS REALLY OPERATE

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:23.208
EFFECTIVELY IN A COMMON SENSE

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.410
WAY- AND THAT'S AGAIN THE

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:27.612
THOUGHT HE KNEW HERE THERE FOR

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:29.281
THIS PARTICULAR BILL BUT I

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:32.250
THINK IT'S A VERY VALID POINT-

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:34.853
TO RAISE. I WILL SAY- IN TERMS

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.089
OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH PUBLIC

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:39.257
COMMENT- AND THE CONCERN I

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:41.093
THINK HE MENTIONED THAT THERE

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:42.360
WAS A TIME WHEN SEVEN HUNDRED

00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:44.196
PEOPLE CALL THEN YOUR LOCAL

00:22:44.262 --> 00:22:49.134
GOVERNMENT UNLIKE. THE

00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:49.668
LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE THE

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:50.235
ABILITY TO PUT. THE LIMITS

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:50.836
ALTHOUGH I THINK THERE SOME.

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:53.238
VALVES SITUATIONS WHERE LOCAL

00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:56.341
GOVERNMENT CAN DO THAT BUT THEY

00:22:56.408 --> 00:22:56.808
SHOULD HAVE SOME MORE

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:58.610
FLEXIBILITY OF. APPARENTLY

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.045
ENTIRE PROCESS IS BEING

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:03.281
COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED- WHEN I

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:05.117
WAS ON THE VERGE SUPERVISORS WE

00:23:05.183 --> 00:23:06.418
HAD SOME WE HAD NO TELEPHONIC

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:08.186
COURSE WE HAD THERE WERE

00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:10.155
HEARINGS OR WE HAD EIGHT HOURS

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:11.089
OF PUBLIC COMMENT WHERE PEOPLE

00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:13.525
JUST. CAME DOWN THE OLD FASHION

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:15.627
WAY AND IT TOOK SIX SEVEN EIGHT

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:17.963
HOURS OR EVEN MORE- SO EVEN

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:20.132
WITH LIVE TESTIMONY YOU CAN

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:20.799
REALLY HAVE AN OVERWHELMING

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:23.602
AMOUNT OF. A PUBLIC TESTIMONY

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:25.804
AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT I WHEN

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:27.272
WE WENT TO TELEPHONIC TESTIMONY

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:29.741

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:36.548

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:37.549
TESTIMONY IN WHAT IS THAT GOING

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:40.018
TO BE LIKE. AND I AS A

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.853
COMMITTEE MEMBER AND ALSO AS A

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.189
CHAIR. THERE'S ONLY BEEN A FEW

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:44.923
TIMES HEN WE REALLY HAVE A

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:49.828
LIMIT- THE TIME OR THE TIMING-

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:51.329

OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:57.536

00:23:57.602 --> 00:24:00.005
IS- JUST FOR US TO BE SO

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:00.639

AND THEN WE CAN REEVALUATE. AND

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:12.017

ENGAGING WITH THEM SINCE DAY

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:25.347

THE CHAIR. PROPERLY MENTIONED

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.918
AT THE TOP OF- THIS DISCUSSION.

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.320
IS THE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:32.587
AT THE BILL THAT WAS PRESENT

01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:35.223
EARLIER BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE.

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:36.959
WHO ALSO HAS A IN A POINT ON

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:39.361
THE SPACE TO INCREASE. THE

REMOTELY ARE THOSE THAT'S VERY

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:44.733
IMPORTANT BUT THE EFFORT WE

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.435
HAVE HERE IS VERY DIFFERENT- IN

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:47.636
FACT I'M A CO AUTHOR OF

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:48.637
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEASE BILL

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:51.173
BECAUSE I SUPPORT. THAT AS WELL

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:51.773
SO IT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.275
TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION-

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:57.679
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THEY- YEAH-

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:59.581
YOU KNOW THEY- HAVEN'T IN MY

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:01.316
OPINION. WANTED TO SERIOUSLY

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:04.486
ENGAGE WITH OUR BILL- THEY'RE

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.088
VIEWED IT AS AN OP YEAH BUT A

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:07.456
BILL THAT'S A COMPETITION WITH

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:09.391
MISTER LEE'S BILL WHICH HIGH- I

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.293
DISAGREE WITH. OTHER EXHAUSTION

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.494

AS WE HAVE FROM DAY ONE AND I

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:15.497
THINK. YOU KNOW THE ONE THING

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:18.166
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS A WE

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:19.668
ARE DOING DID YOU KNOW AND OUR

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:22.237
EFFORT IS WHAT THE POINT IS WE

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.271
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER LAST

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:24.339
YEAR AND A HALF OF. THE DISK

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:26.274
AND THEN IT. IS THE IMPORTANT

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:28.310
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE.

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:29.378
PREPARED FOR THE NEXT

01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:31.380

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:32.514
HOPEFULLY WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:33.949
USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS I KNOW

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:35.484
IT HAS A SUNSET OF TWO YEARS.

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.185
BUT CERTAINLY AND IN THOSE NEXT

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.187
TWO YEARS LOCAL AGENCIES WILL

01:17:39.254 --> 01:17:40.756

HUNDRED MILES OF LAND DEVOTED

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:12.826

THE POLICY THAT WE HAVE NOW

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:42.056
ENCOURAGES CAR DEPENDENCE AND

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:43.857
DISCOURAGES MASS TRANSIT USE

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:45.092
INCREASING VEHICLE MILES

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:59.907
PASSED ON TO HOUSEHOLDS

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:00.507
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY OWN

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:04.745
A CAR. RIGHT NOW. I KNOW

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:06.046
THERE'S BEEN A CONCERN ABOUT

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:07.481
WHAT THIS WILL DO TO DENSITY

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:09.683
BONUS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:10.751
CONCERN IS THAT BECAUSE

01:38:10.818 --> 01:38:13.020
DEVELOPERS TAKE THAT PARKING

01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:13.921
REDUCTIONS AS PART OF DENSITY

01:38:13.988 --> 01:38:15.222
BONUS THAT MAYBE IF WE DO

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:16.390
COUPLE THAT AND DON'T FORCE

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:17.858
THEM TO BILL PARKING WE CAN

01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:19.059
SOMEHOW LEVERAGE THAT BACK TO

01:38:19.126 --> 01:38:21.528
THEM. HOWEVER THE ONLY REASON

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:22.496
THE PARKING REDUCTIONS-

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:24.098
INCLUDED A DENSITY BONUS FOR

01:38:24.164 --> 01:38:25.499
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S JUST

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:27.501
SERVICE THE ADDITIONAL DENSITY

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:28.736
IT'S A THAT DENSITY AND THE

01:38:28.802 --> 01:38:30.237
ABILITY TO BUILD AFTER UNITS

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:31.538
THAT ADDS VALUE TO THE

01:38:31.605 --> 01:38:33.507
BUILDING. NOT THAT ONE TIME

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.409
COST REDUCTION OF THE PARKING

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:37.111
HOW DO WE KNOW THIS FOR A FACT

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:38.646
WE KNOW IT BECAUSE SAN DIEGO

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:39.613
ELIMINATED MINIMUM PARKING

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.515
REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR TRANSIT

01:38:41.582 --> 01:38:42.616
PRIORITY AREAS IN TWO THOUSAND

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:44.618
NINETEEN. AND TWO THOUSAND

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:46.754
TWENTY. AFTER THIS WAS ADOPTED

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.389
THE CITY SAW MORE THAN A FOUR

01:38:48.455 --> 01:38:49.890
TIMES INCREASE IN AFFORDABLE

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:51.992
HOUSING UNITS PROVIDE. SO WE

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:53.227
KNOW THAT REDUCING THE AMOUNT

01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:54.295
OF PARKING THAT'S NEEDED THAT

01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:55.396
ELIMINATING THAT MANDATE DOES

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:57.064
NOT NEGATIVELY AFFECT

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:58.132
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNDER

01:38:58.198 --> 01:38:59.600
DENSITY BONUS. AND WE HAVE

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:01.602

01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:03.537
HOUSING PRODUCERS AT THIS WELL

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:04.838
GIVEN THE KIND OF CERTAINTY

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:06.440
THEY NEED TO BUILD WILL HELP

01:39:06.507 --> 01:39:07.741
THEM WITH FINANCING WILL IT

01:39:07.808 --> 01:39:09.376

01:39:13.847 --> 01:39:15.316
THE MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING THAT

IS NOT SUBSIDIZED THEY'RE NOT

01:39:16.817 --> 01:39:18.252
GETTING TAX CREDITS FOR. FOR

ABLE TO BUILD UNITS AND RENT

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.255

TWO TO ONE. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

02:03:51.857 --> 02:03:54.660

MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS

02:04:35.134 --> 02:04:36.769
INCREDIBLY PERNICIOUS AND EVAN

02:04:36.836 --> 02:04:38.938
SO MANY STUDIES. AND BOOKS

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:40.773
WRITTEN ON THIS. GUY IT'S LIKE

THEM PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT. WORKING

02:05:08.167 --> 02:05:09.168
MINIMUM TO GETTING RID OF IT

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:11.070
THEY THINK OH MEANS NO PARKING

02:05:11.136 --> 02:05:12.972
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. IT MEANS

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:14.373
THAT WENT OUT DEVELOPMENT IS

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:16.508
BEING FORMULATED YOU CAN TAKE

02:05:16.575 --> 02:05:18.310
INTO ACCOUNT WHAT IS THE NEEDED

02:05:18.377 --> 02:05:21.480
PARKING. THERE IF PARKING IS

02:05:21.547 --> 02:05:22.948
GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO

ATTRACT PEOPLE LIVE THERE.

02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:26.352
THERE'S GOING TO BE PARKING IF

IT'S NOT THEN THEY'LL BE LESS

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.856
PARKING OR NO PARKING AND SO

02:05:30.923 --> 02:05:33.692
HAVING THAT FLEXIBILITY- IS

02:05:33.759 --> 02:05:35.261
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT SO AS A

02:05:35.327 --> 02:05:37.663

HOUSING SO DRAMATICALLY THAT

02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:49.308
MAKES HOUSING. MORE AFFORDABLE-

02:05:49.375 --> 02:05:51.744
THE DENSITY BONUS HAS A LOT OF

02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:53.779

THINGS- A BIG FAN OF MR STIVERS

02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:46.704
I DO ACTUALLY OF A DIFFERENT.

02:35:46.770 --> 02:35:47.671
PERSPECTIVE ON THE

02:35:47.738 --> 02:35:49.973
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HA I AGREE

02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:51.909
THAT FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE HA

02:35:51.975 --> 02:35:54.278
WAS BORDERLINE. DEAD LETTER NO

02:35:54.344 --> 02:35:56.914
ONE WAS USING IT- WE ACTUALLY

02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:58.782
THANKS TO LEADERS OF THE CENTER

02:35:58.849 --> 02:36:01.285
SKINNER. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN-

02:36:01.351 --> 02:36:03.387
DREW SIGNIFICANTLY BEEFED UP

02:36:03.454 --> 02:36:05.622
THE HA THE REMEDIES ABILITY TO

02:36:05.689 --> 02:36:07.324
USE THAT. ABILITY TO GET

02:36:07.391 --> 02:36:09.059
ATTORNEYS FEES AND I THINK EVEN

02:36:09.126 --> 02:36:10.627
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY

02:36:10.694 --> 02:36:12.796
PENALTIES- FROM. CITIES THAT

02:36:12.863 --> 02:36:14.364
WAS A VERY HARD BILL THAT

02:36:14.431 --> 02:36:15.399
REALLY GAVE LIFE TO AND I'VE

02:36:15.466 --> 02:36:18.736
SEEN. IN THE BAY AREA. I'M

02:36:18.802 --> 02:36:21.472
INCLUDING MY OWN HOMETOWN- WE

02:36:21.538 --> 02:36:24.475
HAVE SEEN. OUR DEVELOPERS BE

02:36:24.541 --> 02:36:26.977
WILLING TO SUE. US CITIES AND

02:36:27.044 --> 02:36:28.812
CITIES HAVE TO. PAY ATTORNEY'S

02:36:28.879 --> 02:36:30.380
FEES AND I THINK IT HAS

02:36:30.447 --> 02:36:31.915
ACTUALLY SHIFTED THE DYNAMIC

02:36:31.982 --> 02:36:33.784
CITIES NO INCLUDING MY OWN CITY

02:36:33.851 --> 02:36:35.285
OF SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HAS NOT

02:36:35.352 --> 02:36:38.088
ALWAYS BEEN- 100% TIME THE BEST

02:36:38.155 --> 02:36:40.023
DR. CITY OF BERKELEY WHICH USED

02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:41.458
TO BE A VERY BAD ACTOR AND JUST

02:36:41.525 --> 02:36:43.694
RECENTLY DENYING PROJECTS

02:36:43.761 --> 02:36:44.628
WEALTHY CITIES ON THE

02:36:44.695 --> 02:36:46.130
PENINSULA. SO I THINK IT HAS

02:36:46.196 --> 02:36:48.098
HAD A REAL IMPACT I BUT I DO

02:36:48.165 --> 02:36:50.267
AGREE THAT HAVING. A MINUTE

02:36:50.334 --> 02:36:52.703
MINISTRY TO PROCESS- WHERE YOU

02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:53.704
DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE

02:36:53.771 --> 02:36:55.639
POLITICIZATION. IS A GOOD IDEA

02:36:55.706 --> 02:36:57.341
AND THAT'S WHY SUPPORT THOSE

02:36:57.407 --> 02:36:59.042
ARE BUILT ON THERE'S I KNOW

02:36:59.109 --> 02:37:00.677
THAT- THERE'S GONNA FOCUS ON

02:37:00.744 --> 02:37:01.645
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THIS BILL

02:37:01.712 --> 02:37:03.213
BUT TO BE CLEAR IT'S OFTEN I'VE

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:05.315
DISCUSSED. THIS BILL APPLIES AS

02:37:05.382 --> 02:37:06.884
LONG AS THERE'S 20%

02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:09.353
AFFORDABILITY- WHICH HAPPENS TO

02:37:09.419 --> 02:37:11.155
BE THE INCLUSIONARY ABOUT A LOT

02:37:11.221 --> 02:37:11.722
YOU KNOW A FAIR NUMBER OF

02:37:11.789 --> 02:37:14.658
CITIES. HAVE SO A LOT OF

02:37:14.725 --> 02:37:16.093
SUPERMARKET RATE WITH

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.761
INCLUSIONARY MIXED INCOME

02:37:17.828 --> 02:37:19.830
HOUSING WILL BE PART OF THIS-

02:37:19.897 --> 02:37:21.732
AS WELL AND SO AS WE DO THESE

02:37:21.799 --> 02:37:23.734
CLARIFICATIONS- THEY NEED TO

02:37:23.801 --> 02:37:32.176
BE. ABLE TO- BUT I'M HAPPY. THE

02:37:32.242 --> 02:37:33.410
BILL- WITH MACHINE ON THE- BY.

02:37:33.477 --> 02:37:35.846
AS SOON WE PLEASE ENTER. YEAH-

02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:37.481
SINCE THIS IS BY BACK AND FOR

02:37:37.548 --> 02:37:38.282
THE BILL HERE WITH THE- AND

02:37:38.348 --> 02:37:39.550
WHAT WAS THEIR- HE- ME THROUGH.

02:37:39.616 --> 02:37:41.852
WHAT THIS NOW MEANS THE END

02:37:41.919 --> 02:37:44.955
RESULT. WHAT ARE THE CHANGES

02:37:45.022 --> 02:37:46.690
COMBINING WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY

02:37:46.757 --> 02:37:48.625
HAD. WITH THE AMENDMENTS. WHAT

02:37:48.692 --> 02:37:50.627
DOES THAT MEAN NOW. YEAH

02:37:50.694 --> 02:37:52.362
ABSOLUTELY SENATORS SO- ALL

02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:53.197
WALKING THROUGH THEM AND THEN

02:37:53.263 --> 02:37:54.464
OF COURSE IF THAT THE CHAIR

02:37:54.531 --> 02:37:55.666
WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANY COMMENTS

02:37:55.732 --> 02:37:57.067
TO THAT. SO PART OF THIS IS

02:37:57.134 --> 02:37:59.236
BEFORE WE WERE HAVE- A NUMBER

02:37:59.303 --> 02:38:00.270
OF FOLKS ON THE COMMITTEE THAT

02:38:00.337 --> 02:38:02.673
WOULD BE- APPOINTEES OF THE

02:38:02.739 --> 02:38:04.041
GOVERNOR AND OTHER FOLKS THAT

02:38:04.107 --> 02:38:04.875
WERE COMING FROM LOCAL

02:38:04.942 --> 02:38:06.743
GOVERNMENT OR HAD EXPERTISE. IN

02:38:06.810 --> 02:38:08.178
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE NOW

02:38:08.245 --> 02:38:09.413
REPLACE THAT WITH A PANEL OF

02:38:09.479 --> 02:38:11.281
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES. SO

02:38:11.348 --> 02:38:12.516
WE'LL HAVE THOSE FOLKS INSTEAD

02:38:12.583 --> 02:38:15.052
OF THE APPOINTEES- A SUNSET IT

02:38:15.118 --> 02:38:18.355
HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE BILL OF

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:19.223
JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY

02:38:19.289 --> 02:38:22.025
NINE. THE CAN OCCUR- ONLY AFTER

02:38:22.092 --> 02:38:23.260
THE LOCAL AGENCY HAS MADE A

02:38:23.327 --> 02:38:25.095
FINAL DECISION. SO THAT'S

02:38:25.162 --> 02:38:27.364
CLEAR- BUT WE'VE ALSO BUILT IN

02:38:27.431 --> 02:38:28.866
TIME FOR THE LOCAL AGENCY TO

02:38:28.932 --> 02:38:31.134
CURE THE DECISION- SO THAT IF

02:38:31.201 --> 02:38:32.836
THAT. IF THEY MAKE A DECISION

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:33.670
AND THEN THERE'S SOME DISPUTE

02:38:33.737 --> 02:38:34.805
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S COMPLIANCE

02:38:34.872 --> 02:38:35.739
COMPLYING WITH THE HOUSING

02:38:35.806 --> 02:38:36.807
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT THE PARTIES

02:38:36.874 --> 02:38:38.642
WOULD THEN HAVE. SOME TIME TO

02:38:38.709 --> 02:38:40.143
GO BACK AND TRY TO NEGOTIATE

02:38:40.210 --> 02:38:41.211
SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY FELT

02:38:41.278 --> 02:38:43.647
GOOD ABOUT. BEFORE THAT. REVIEW

02:38:43.714 --> 02:38:45.515
PROCESS WOULD BE TRIGGERED-

02:38:45.582 --> 02:38:46.750
THERE WERE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO

02:38:46.817 --> 02:38:48.952
A FEW TIME LINES IN THE BILL-

02:38:49.019 --> 02:38:50.220
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT

02:38:50.287 --> 02:38:51.922
THAT THE TIMELINE WAS WORKABLE-

02:38:51.989 --> 02:38:53.090
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THIS FINAL

02:38:53.156 --> 02:38:54.625
POINT. ABOUT USING THE

02:38:54.691 --> 02:38:56.193
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS NOT

02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:57.694
FIRST SO THOSE WERE THE THOSE

02:38:57.761 --> 02:39:00.264
ARE THE MAJOR- THOSE ARE THE

02:39:00.330 --> 02:39:01.498
MAJOR MINUTES I THINK I'VE YOU

02:39:01.565 --> 02:39:02.399
KNOW IF YOU WANT ANYTHING MR

02:39:02.466 --> 02:39:03.567

UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW YOU'RE I

02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:05.202
THINK YOU'RE- YOU'RE PRETTY

02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:06.570
MUCH SPOT ON THERE AS A MEMBER

02:39:06.637 --> 02:39:07.938
I THINK THAT THE ONE PIECE THAT

02:39:08.005 --> 02:39:09.539
WE- HAD FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO

02:39:09.606 --> 02:39:11.208
GOING INTO. A POTENTIAL

02:39:11.275 --> 02:39:13.277
CORRECTIVE ACTION BEING ABLE TO

02:39:13.343 --> 02:39:15.078
GET THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE

02:39:15.145 --> 02:39:16.113
SIXTY DAYS TO BE ABLE TO GET IT

02:39:16.179 --> 02:39:17.681
DONE UNDER THEIR J. I DIDN'T

02:39:17.748 --> 02:39:19.149
DEATH TO BE ABLE TO CORRECT IT.

02:39:19.216 --> 02:39:20.617
NUMBER ONE. AND THEN RATHER

02:39:20.684 --> 02:39:22.386
THAN ANY OF THE POLITICAL

02:39:22.452 --> 02:39:24.187
APPOINTMENTS. WE'RE TAKING A

02:39:24.254 --> 02:39:25.322
VERY SIMILAR APPROACH THAT WE

02:39:25.389 --> 02:39:25.989
DO WITH THE BOARD OF

02:39:26.056 --> 02:39:27.624
EQUALIZATION OR THE PUBLIC

02:39:27.691 --> 02:39:28.425
UTILITIES COMMISSION WHERE WE

02:39:28.492 --> 02:39:29.693
HAVE A CONTENT EXPERT IS

02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:31.328
ADMINISTERED LAW JUDGE. HEARING

02:39:31.395 --> 02:39:33.964
THAT AS WELL- SO THAT'S THE

02:39:34.031 --> 02:39:35.565
REMAINDER OF THE BILL HASN'T

02:39:35.632 --> 02:39:37.868
BEEN TOUCHED IT SIMPLY- THE

02:39:37.935 --> 02:39:41.638
PROCESS. RELATING TO WHO. AND

02:39:41.705 --> 02:39:43.941
IN WHAT TIMELINE I WILL HEAR

02:39:44.007 --> 02:39:45.809
ANY OF THESE ALLEGED

02:39:45.876 --> 02:39:49.680
VIOLATIONS. SO IT SO THE-

02:39:49.746 --> 02:39:53.016
THERE'S STILL- THE OP. THERE'S

02:39:53.083 --> 02:39:55.018
STILL THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT.

02:39:55.085 --> 02:39:57.020
YOU HAVE TO GO TO LITIGATION

02:39:57.087 --> 02:39:59.523
THEY EVEN. EVEN WITH THIS

02:39:59.589 --> 02:40:01.692
PROCESS IT IT IT WOULD BE

02:40:01.758 --> 02:40:03.160
ABSOLUTE TO SAY THAT IN

02:40:03.226 --> 02:40:04.261
INDIVIDUALS IN FRONT OF THE

02:40:04.328 --> 02:40:05.762
MINISTRY OF LOGICS THEY HAVE TO

02:40:05.829 --> 02:40:06.163
BE TO COMPLETE THE

02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:07.965
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JEFF PROCESS

02:40:08.031 --> 02:40:09.599
BUT THEN THEY COULD TAKE- THE

02:40:09.666 --> 02:40:10.834
JURISDICTION TO COURT. AFTER

02:40:10.901 --> 02:40:16.206
THEY. GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS

02:40:16.273 --> 02:40:18.075
100% TWENTY FIVE. IT DOESN'T IF

02:40:18.141 --> 02:40:19.476
IT DOES ELIMINATE THE LET'S NOT

02:40:19.543 --> 02:40:21.244
LOSE SIGHT DOESN'T. OF THEIR

02:40:21.311 --> 02:40:22.579
LIVES AND A NUMBER YOU CAN AND

02:40:22.646 --> 02:40:23.113
I'M I JUST HAD ONE OF THE

02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:24.948
THINGS OR IF I MAY THAT. FOR

02:40:25.015 --> 02:40:26.083
THEIR DIFFERENT CLASSES OF

02:40:26.149 --> 02:40:27.284
PLAINTIFFS PEOPLE WHO CAN BRING

02:40:27.351 --> 02:40:28.318
CHALLENGE UNDER THE HOUSING

02:40:28.385 --> 02:40:29.987
KIND OF ALL THE ACT AND SO FOR.

02:40:30.053 --> 02:40:31.722
CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS OR

02:40:31.788 --> 02:40:32.622
PROSPECTIVE TENANTS THEY HAVE

02:40:32.689 --> 02:40:33.857
THE ABILITY TO GO IMMEDIATELY

02:40:33.924 --> 02:40:36.493
TO COURT THE- THE REVIEW PANEL.

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:37.728
IS INTENDED SPECIFICALLY FOR

02:40:37.794 --> 02:40:38.962
APPLICANTS RICHEST DEVELOPERS

02:40:39.029 --> 02:40:40.931
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SO

02:40:40.998 --> 02:40:42.699
WOULD YOU CONSIDER THIS THAT

02:40:42.766 --> 02:40:46.436
IT'S GOING TO. EXPEDITE GIVE

02:40:46.503 --> 02:40:48.438
THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPEDITE.

02:40:48.505 --> 02:40:49.773
BUT IT STILL GIVES THE

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:51.441
OPPORTUNITY TO STILL GIVES THE

02:40:51.508 --> 02:40:54.244
RIGHT TO GO TO COURT SO. HOW

02:40:54.311 --> 02:40:55.812
HOW DOES THAT REALLY EXPEDITE

02:40:55.879 --> 02:40:58.448
CORRECTIVE CHAU- THE IDEA HERE

02:40:58.515 --> 02:41:00.984
AND PART OF THIS IS BASED ON-

02:41:01.051 --> 02:41:01.618
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM

02:41:01.685 --> 02:41:02.786
FOLKS IN THE FIELD BUT ALSO

02:41:02.853 --> 02:41:04.087
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES

02:41:04.154 --> 02:41:04.821
THAT HAVE. THAT HAVE ADOPTED

02:41:04.888 --> 02:41:07.290
THIS APPROACH. IF SOMEBODY NOW.

02:41:07.357 --> 02:41:09.059
D. FILES A LAWSUIT IN ALL

02:41:09.126 --> 02:41:10.427
LIKELIHOOD IT'S GOING TO TAKE

02:41:10.494 --> 02:41:12.095
THEM TO YEARS OF TIME RIGHT TED

02:41:12.162 --> 02:41:12.963
WE'VE GOT GOING THROUGH THE

02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.797
PROCESS OF LITIGATION IT'S

02:41:13.864 --> 02:41:14.731
GONNA COST THEM HUNDREDS OF

02:41:14.798 --> 02:41:15.499
THOUSANDS OR EVEN MILLIONS OF

02:41:15.565 --> 02:41:16.867
DOLLARS. TO HAVE THAT

02:41:16.933 --> 02:41:18.802
LITIGATED- AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:41:18.869 --> 02:41:20.137
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THAT

02:41:20.203 --> 02:41:21.872
PROCESS MIGHT WORK OUT. IT'S A

02:41:21.938 --> 02:41:22.739
LOT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:41:22.806 --> 02:41:24.307
DEVELOPERS HAVE SAIDTHEY ARE

02:41:24.374 --> 02:41:25.575
EXTREMELY RELUCTANT EVEN WHEN

02:41:25.642 --> 02:41:28.078
THERE'S A CLEAR. OPEN VIOLATION

02:41:28.145 --> 02:41:29.012
OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY

02:41:29.079 --> 02:41:30.347
ACT TO ENGAGE IN LITIGATION

02:41:30.414 --> 02:41:32.516
PROCESS AND SO. THIS PANEL IS

02:41:32.582 --> 02:41:33.850
SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN GO

02:41:33.917 --> 02:41:35.118
BECAUSE OF THE TIME LINES THAT

02:41:35.185 --> 02:41:36.653
ARE SET UP. YOU CAN GET A

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:38.789
DECISION MUCH MORE QUICKLY. YOU

02:41:38.855 --> 02:41:39.956
CAN HAVE A LESS ADVERSARIAL

02:41:40.023 --> 02:41:51.601
PROCESS- LESS EXPENSIVE PROCESS

02:41:51.668 --> 02:41:52.169
AND WHAT REALLY STRUCK TO ME

02:41:52.235 --> 02:41:52.803
ABOUT THIS. IS WHEN WE LOOK AT

02:41:52.869 --> 02:41:53.370
THE RE THAT WAS DONE ON HOW

02:41:53.437 --> 02:41:53.970
IT'S BEEN IN. ANOTHER STATES

02:41:54.037 --> 02:41:54.638
BUT MASTER. A VERY SICK. NUMBER

02:41:54.704 --> 02:41:56.106
OF THESE. THESE APPEAL. ACTION

02:41:56.173 --> 02:41:57.007
OF SADDAM THEY'RE NOT HEARD BY

02:41:57.074 --> 02:41:57.974
THE BOY SO. THE ME FACT THAT

02:41:58.041 --> 02:41:59.342
THERE AN APPEAL. SURE TO GET

02:41:59.409 --> 02:42:00.377
THE- TO GO. THEY CAN NEGOTIATED

02:42:00.444 --> 02:42:01.912
FAITH OUT A DEAL GET TO YES AND

02:42:01.978 --> 02:42:03.747
BE ABLE TO. TO PROCEED FOR TO

02:42:03.814 --> 02:42:05.215
THE IDEA HERE IS TO CREATE. A

02:42:05.282 --> 02:42:06.149
PROCESS THAT IS LESS

02:42:06.216 --> 02:42:08.685
CONFRONTATIONAL LESS EXPENSIVE

02:42:08.752 --> 02:42:10.821
QUICKER AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH

02:42:10.887 --> 02:42:12.823
EXPERTS AS AS THE AS THE

02:42:12.889 --> 02:42:17.861
CHAIRMAN. CHEN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:42:17.928 --> 02:42:18.528
LAW JUDGES WHO HAVE DEEP SOUTH.

02:42:18.595 --> 02:42:19.096
EXPERTISE WHO CAN HELP TO

02:42:19.162 --> 02:42:20.730
RESOLVE THESE TO. MARC OKAY.

02:42:20.797 --> 02:42:23.166
WELL YOU'RE HOPEFUL. RIGHT THIS

02:42:23.233 --> 02:42:25.135
IS THIS IS B. THAT THIS WILL IN

02:42:25.202 --> 02:42:28.505
FACT HELP. OF TO BRING PEOPLE

02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:29.706
TOGETHER TO THE PARTIES

02:42:29.773 --> 02:42:31.908
TOGETHER TO THE FALL I GUESS

02:42:31.975 --> 02:42:33.610
I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT IF

02:42:33.677 --> 02:42:34.611
THEY'RE STILL THE RIGHT TO GO

02:42:34.678 --> 02:42:37.581
TO COURT THEN IS THIS ANOTHER.

02:42:37.647 --> 02:42:39.716
ANOTHER DELAY. YOU KNOW IN THE

02:42:39.783 --> 02:42:41.118
PROCESS YEAH I DON'T TO SENATE

02:42:41.184 --> 02:42:42.352
SENATOR IF I MAY YOU KNOW THAT

02:42:42.419 --> 02:42:43.887
THAT MIGHT MY HOPE HERE IS BORN

02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:44.855
OUT OF TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ONE

02:42:44.921 --> 02:42:46.623
IS THE RESEARCH WHICH- WAS DONE

02:42:46.690 --> 02:42:48.558
BY MIT. THAT HELPED US TO

02:42:48.625 --> 02:42:50.160
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS. IN

02:42:50.227 --> 02:42:52.095
IN IN YOU KNOW IN PRACTICE IN

02:42:52.162 --> 02:42:53.263
THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS

02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:53.930
WHERE YOU'VE HEARD IT'S BEEN IN

02:42:53.997 --> 02:42:55.999
PLACE FOR SEVERAL DECADES- AND

02:42:56.066 --> 02:42:57.834
ALSO MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS AN

02:42:57.901 --> 02:42:59.669
ATTORNEY- AND UNDERSTANDING THE

02:42:59.736 --> 02:43:00.904
RELUCTANCE OF PEOPLE TO GO

02:43:00.971 --> 02:43:01.771
ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN THE

02:43:01.838 --> 02:43:03.340
LITIGATION PROCESS JUST HOW

02:43:03.406 --> 02:43:04.941
EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE. AND

02:43:05.008 --> 02:43:06.109
TIME CONSUMING CAN BE IT SO

02:43:06.176 --> 02:43:07.310
OFTEN LITIGATION TO GET INTO

02:43:07.377 --> 02:43:08.912
COLLATERAL ISSUES OF. WHAT

02:43:08.979 --> 02:43:09.779
DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE

02:43:09.846 --> 02:43:11.014
DISCOVERED DISCOVERY WHOSE

02:43:11.081 --> 02:43:12.149
DEPOSITION YOU GET TO TAKE I

02:43:12.215 --> 02:43:13.984
MEAN YOU CAN JUST GO DOWN ALL

02:43:14.050 --> 02:43:14.584
KINDS OF RABBIT HOLES IN THE

02:43:14.651 --> 02:43:16.419
LITIGATION PROCESS. AND YOU

02:43:16.486 --> 02:43:17.420
KNOW IN SOME WAYS THIS IS MORE

02:43:17.487 --> 02:43:20.490
I CAN TO YOU KNOW AN EXPEDITED-

02:43:20.557 --> 02:43:22.325
NEGOTIATION PROCESS OR OR AN

02:43:22.392 --> 02:43:23.593
EXPEDITED RESOLUTION PROCESS

02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:24.461
WHERE THE WHERE THE PARTIES CAN

02:43:24.528 --> 02:43:25.862
GET TOGETHER. GET TO THE HEART

02:43:25.929 --> 02:43:26.930
OF THE ISSUE WITH IT WITH AN

02:43:26.997 --> 02:43:28.465
EXPERTISE WITH WITH FOLKS WITH

02:43:28.532 --> 02:43:34.104
EXPERTISE. GET SOME KIND OF

02:43:34.171 --> 02:43:35.772
RESOLUTION SO ULTIMATELY THERE

02:43:35.839 --> 02:43:38.275
IS THAT OPTION OF LITIGATION AT

02:43:38.341 --> 02:43:40.677
AT THAT THAT STILL REMAINS. BUT

02:43:40.744 --> 02:43:42.512
I THINK BECAUSE OF INCENTIVES

02:43:42.579 --> 02:43:44.581
IN ECONOMICS AND TIME AND A LOT

02:43:44.648 --> 02:43:45.815
OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THEY'RE

02:43:45.882 --> 02:43:47.184
GONNA BE VERY STRONG INCENTIVES

02:43:47.250 --> 02:43:49.052
FOR FOLKS TO USE THE APPEAL

02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:49.719
PANEL RATHER THAN TO ENTER INTO

02:43:49.786 --> 02:43:51.788
LITIGATION. AND I KNOW THE ONLY

02:43:51.855 --> 02:43:53.823
SAY THAT I'M SORRY NOT TRYING

02:43:53.890 --> 02:43:56.226
TO BE CYNICAL OR NEGATIVE BUT-

02:43:56.293 --> 02:43:59.229
OBVIOUSLY- ANY ENTITIES THE

02:43:59.296 --> 02:44:01.665
FIGHTS. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:44:01.731 --> 02:44:02.832
AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD

02:44:02.899 --> 02:44:04.801
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY GET

02:44:04.868 --> 02:44:07.370
PRETTY A DUG IN THEIR HEELS SO

02:44:07.437 --> 02:44:11.208
I'M HOPEFUL. ON AND I THINK YOU

02:44:11.274 --> 02:44:11.808
SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:44:11.875 --> 02:44:12.375
DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:44:12.442 --> 02:44:16.046

FURTHER TO US IN REQUIRE CENTER

02:44:20.617 --> 02:44:22.319
ROSS'S QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S

02:44:22.385 --> 02:44:24.454
ACTUALLY THE ISSUES YOU RAISE

02:44:24.521 --> 02:44:25.322
ARE EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN

02:44:25.388 --> 02:44:27.190
DISCUSSING FOR THE FINAL

02:44:27.257 --> 02:44:29.259
AMENDMENT WHICH- THE BILL AS

02:44:29.326 --> 02:44:31.361
INTRODUCED MAKES THE

02:44:31.428 --> 02:44:33.463
ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL OPTIONAL

02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:34.231
TO SOMEONE CAN GO TO COURT

02:44:34.297 --> 02:44:35.565
RIGHT WHERE THEY WANT WHERE

02:44:35.632 --> 02:44:37.067
THEY CAN PURSUE THIS AND MANY

02:44:37.133 --> 02:44:38.969
PEOPLE WILL PURSUE THE- OFF IF

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:39.936
THEY HAVE AN OPTION THE

02:44:40.003 --> 02:44:41.037
ADMINISTRATIVE CODE BECAUSE IT

02:44:41.104 --> 02:44:42.772
IS. I AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY

MEMBER IT'S CHEAPER IT'S FASTER

02:44:44.841 --> 02:44:46.610
AND MORE EFFICIENT BUT THEN

02:44:46.676 --> 02:44:47.644
THERE ARE OF COURSE THERE ARE

02:44:47.711 --> 02:44:49.679
THE DESTRUCTION OF CITIES THAT

02:44:49.746 --> 02:44:51.047
ARE WILLING TO PAY WHATEVER WE

02:44:51.114 --> 02:44:52.148
KNOW WE SORT OF KNOW WHO THEY

02:44:52.215 --> 02:44:54.117
ARE- WHERE THERE COULD BE AN

02:44:54.184 --> 02:44:55.986
UNSETTLED QUESTION OF LAW THAT

02:44:56.052 --> 02:44:56.753
REALLY ALL TO MY HOUSE TO GO TO

02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:58.755
THE COURTS. AND ONE OF THE

02:44:58.822 --> 02:45:00.790
THINGS THAT- REALLY WORKING ON

02:45:00.857 --> 02:45:04.194
NEXT WEEK IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:45:04.261 --> 02:45:05.895
FIRST SOLAR THERE REALLY FIRM

02:45:05.962 --> 02:45:07.063
TIME LINE SO YOU CAN'T GET

02:45:07.130 --> 02:45:09.266
CAUGHT UP IN A IF IT IS GOING

02:45:09.332 --> 02:45:10.834
TO BE NOT A GOOD ADMINISTRATIVE

02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:12.369
PROCESS BUT YOU'RE NOT CAUGHT
