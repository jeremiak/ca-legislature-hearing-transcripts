00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.581
HOPED FOR BECAUSE IT STARTED IN

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:04.349
SEPTEMBER AND I THINK THAT. IT

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:05.684
WAS FINALIZED SOMETIME IN

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:08.153
DECEMBER WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT ODD

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.187
SO THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A

00:23:09.254 --> 00:23:10.589
LITTLE BIT OF RESISTANCE ON THE

00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:12.824
PART OF CDC ARE MAYBE PRIVACY

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.459
ISSUES AND ALL OF THAT. I

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:16.061
UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAINLY THAT

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:17.896
TERM UNFORTUNATELY I STILL HAVE

00:23:17.963 --> 00:23:19.397
HAD MANY CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE

00:23:19.464 --> 00:23:21.633
CONTACTING ME REGARDING THEIR

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.602
EDT ACCOUNT FROZEN BECAUSE THEY

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:25.604
WERE TOLD- THAT THEY WERE IN

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.640
PRISON AND DO YOU TO- I STAFF

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:30.275
WORKING DILIGENTLY WE'VE BEEN

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:32.043
ABLE TO GET THROUGH OF SOME OF

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.245
THOSE TO CLEAR UP MANY OF THE

00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:35.881
ACCOUNTS HOWEVER- I AM

00:23:35.947 --> 00:23:37.949
CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS CDD

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:40.352
HAS PUT IN PLACE TO ASSIST. WE

00:23:40.418 --> 00:23:41.553
DEVELOPMENT CLAIMANTS ARE

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.488
RESOLVED THEIR CASES WHEN THEY

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:45.590
ARE FLAG THIS POTENTIAL FRAUD

00:23:45.657 --> 00:23:46.892
AND I KNOW THAT SPAN AGAIN

00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:48.226
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE IN THE

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:49.594
MIDDLE OF THAT IT WOULD BE VERY

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:50.662
HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:52.931
PROCESS SO THAT OUR DISTRICT

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:54.599
STAFF'S MIND IN PARTICULAR AND

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:55.834
I KNOW THAT I SHARED THIS WITH

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.235
ALL OUR COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE

00:23:57.302 --> 00:23:58.870
LEGISLATURE THEY'RE BASICALLY

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:00.872
ALMOST PRO BONO WORKERS FOR.

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:02.774
EDT CLAIMS AND A U. I. B.

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:04.943
CLAIMS EXCUSE ME AND IT WOULD

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.245
BE GREAT IF THERE'S A PROCESS

00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:09.447
IN PLACE THAT A CLAIMANT CAN GO

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:11.416
DIRECTLY THROUGH EDT AND GET

00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:14.085
THAT RESOLVED RATHER THAN- OF

00:24:14.152 --> 00:24:15.754
HAVING TO BE THE INTERMEDIARY

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.322
FOR THEM BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:18.957
ISSUES THAT ARE THERE

00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:24.162
OBVIOUSLY- FOR MANY WHO HAVE

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:26.331
JUST APPLIED. AND ARE. BASED ON

00:24:26.398 --> 00:24:27.566
SOME OF THE- STAFF REPORTS AND

00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:28.333
GET. IT FILLED BETTER BUT WE

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.168
SEE HAVE ONES THAT GO WAY BACK

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:30.936
AND I THINK THOSE ARE ONES THAT

00:24:31.002 --> 00:24:33.305
ARE STILL. PROBABLY WOUND UP IN

00:24:33.371 --> 00:24:35.240
SOME OF THE FRAUD ISSUE SO-

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.775
COULD YOU GIVE A LITTLE MORE IN

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:38.743
DEPTH DISCUSSION ON THE PROCESS

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.313
THAT EDT IS USING TO. ASSIST

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:43.014
THE CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE HAD.

00:24:43.081 --> 00:24:44.716
THEIR KEY FLAGGED AS A

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.718
POTENTIAL FRAUD AND- PERHAPS-

00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:50.755
TIED UP WITH THE- THE- THOSE

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.824
WHO WERE IN PRISON IN HAND ON

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:54.426
THESE. THEIR VIEWS THEIR

00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:56.461
IDENTITY TO OBVIOUSLY-

00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:59.197
ILLEGALLY GOT TO MAKE A CLAIM

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:01.032
AND ACTUALLY RECEIVE BENEFITS.

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:02.634
ABSOLUTELY AND AGAIN I WANT TO

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:04.069
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS

00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:07.739
MORNING- SO JUST BRIEFLY ON THE

00:25:07.806 --> 00:25:09.808
CDCR DATA SHARING AGREEMENT YES

00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:11.910
IT WAS ENTERED INTO INTO IN

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:14.713
DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR- AND IT

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:18.116
HAS ALLOWED EDT TO- TO CLEARLY

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:20.118
SEE DATA AND ANALYZE IT AGAINST

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:22.220
OUR CLAIM AT POPULATION. AND WE

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:24.890
DO THIS VERY REGULARLY- WHAT

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:28.627
WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT THE DATA

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:30.862
IS NOT AS CLEAN- AS AS WE WOULD

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:32.998
HAVE HOPED- AND IT'S IMPORTANT

00:25:33.064 --> 00:25:35.200
THAT WE CHECKED AGAINST MANY.

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:36.768
MORE WAYS OF IDENTIFYING A

00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:39.237
CLAIM IT BECAUSE AT THE DATA

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:41.006
CAN BE IN PERFECT SHOULD ALSO

00:25:41.072 --> 00:25:43.475
SUPPLEMENTED THAT DATA WITH A

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:45.777
REGULAR CHECKS AGAINST. A THIRD

00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:49.414
PARTY VENDOR AT THOMSON REUTERS.

00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:52.484
ALLOWS US TO ALSO LOOK AT-

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.185
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND

00:25:54.252 --> 00:25:55.954
ACROSS OTHER STATES AS WELL AS

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:58.623
SOME COUNTY JAILS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.358
I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT THE

00:26:00.425 --> 00:26:02.661
PROCESS HAS BEEN- CLOSELY

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.396
REVIEWED IT TO ENSURE DUE

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:07.432
PROCESS TO ALL CLAIMANTS- IT IS

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:10.936
IMPORTANT THAT. WE GET AND TRY

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.470
TO MAKE A REASONABLE CONTACT

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:14.606
WITH THE CLAIM IT BEFORE THEY

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:16.074
ARE DISQUALIFIED FROM RECEIVING

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:18.343
BENEFITS AND AROUND THE ISSUE

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.211
OF INCARCERATIONS IT'S SUCH A

00:26:20.278 --> 00:26:21.846
TRICKY ONE BECAUSE BEING

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:24.482
INCARCERATED- WHILE RECEIVING

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:27.686
BENEFITS IS THAT- AWAY MEANS TO

00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:29.821
DISQUALIFY HAVING BEEN

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:31.856
INCARCERATED IN THE PAST ISN'T.

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:34.025
AND WHAT WE'RE ALSO LEARNING-

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:35.093
IS THAT THE DATES OF

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.097
INCARCERATION ARE ALWAYS WHAT

00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:40.231
THEY APPEAR TO BE. AND SO IT IS

00:26:40.298 --> 00:26:43.001
IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:45.437
CONTACT CLEMENS AND CLARIFIED

00:26:45.503 --> 00:26:49.741
THAT INFORMATION- BUT BEFORE-

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:51.676
IT LEADS TO DISQUALIFICATION OF

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:52.744
COURSE THAT WORKS ABOUT THE

00:26:52.811 --> 00:26:55.380
CLAIM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO APPEAL

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:55.981
AND GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AS

00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:57.749
WELL. WITHOUT DOUBT GOING TO BE

00:26:57.816 --> 00:26:59.351
VERY HELPFUL IF THE THAT GET

00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:01.720
SOME REFINED IS SO THAT A CLAIM

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.822
IS GOING DIRECTLY TO EDT AND-

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:05.090
THEN THAT FLAG SOLVE THE

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.858
SITUATION AND IT SHOULD BE ABLE

00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:08.593
TO BE RESOLVED I WOULD THINK.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.861
PRETTY QUICKLY WHEREAS RIGHT

00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:11.663

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.231

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:20.605
ONE WHEN YOU HAVE A SYSTEM THAT

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:22.640
SEEMS TO BE SO UPSIDE DOWN. IN

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:25.010
ARE BEING INUNDATED AND IN A

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:26.544
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH

BUT IN THIS CASE. THIS

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.838

THEY'RE ALLOWED THROUGH

00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:16.507
SEPTEMBER- AND IT'S ANYONE'S

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:17.942
GUESS WHAT THE FEDERAL

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.443
GOVERNMENT WILL DO- COME

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.112
SEPTEMBER I'VE HEARD I'VE HEARD

00:36:21.178 --> 00:36:23.814
BOTH WAYS SO I CAN'T SAY FOR

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:25.116
CERTAIN. I WAS HOPING YOU HAD

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:31.055
AN INSIDE TRACK. IS THERE A

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:32.456
POSSIBILITY I'VE HEARD ALSO

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:33.491
THAT THERE'S A- THAT THE

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:35.626
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL AND

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:38.596
WILL AND I DON'T SEE FOR GIFT

00:36:38.663 --> 00:36:43.301
BUT- AT THE END. NOT CHARGE THE

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:47.104
TAX CREDIT TERM AS UPON OR IS

00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:49.106
THAT NOT TRUE. MY UNDERSTANDING

00:36:49.173 --> 00:36:51.309
THAT CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:52.443
GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY WAIVING

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.980
THE INTEREST- THAT THE STATE OF

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.648
CALIFORNIA WOULD OTHERWISE BE

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.850
PAYING- AND I BELIEVE THE LAST

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:00.851
INTEREST PAYMENT WOULD HAVE

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:02.820
BEEN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE.

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.523
MILLION DOLLARS- SO I DO KNOW

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.359
OF THAT WAIVER- I CAN'T SAY IF

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:12.897
THERE IS ANY PLANS TO REDUCE.

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:15.299
THE TAX. I GUESS IN THE FUTURE

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:16.500
SO THERE WE'VE THE INTO BUT THE

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:19.503
NOT THE PRINCIPLE. THAT'S MY

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.305
UNDER THAT'S- SO THERE'S

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:22.740
APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE POINT

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:23.774

WITH THE THIRD PARTY REVIEW

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:01.818
PROCESS GIVEN THEY HAVE TO

DEAR TO MY HEART I HAVE WORKED

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:20.590
ON BEHALF OF MISCLASSIFIED

WORKERS I AM FOR MUCH OF MY

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:25.061
CAREER- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:26.195
WE CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THE LAWS

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:27.297
IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE MISS

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:29.532
CLASSIFICATION DOES REALLY HURT

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:31.234
THE STATE IT HURTS BUT THE

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:32.602
CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE TO GO

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:34.737
THROUGH A VERY ARDUOUS PROCESS

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:35.571
TO BE FOUND ELIGIBLE FOR

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:37.440
BENEFITS TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:39.876
WERE IN FACT EMPLOYEES- BUT

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:42.412
ALSO IT HURTS. THE COMPLYING

00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:43.846
BUSINESSES THE ONES THAT ARE

00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:46.015
ARE PAYING INTO THE FUND- AND

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.617
SO THIS IS CERTAINLY AN AREA OF

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:51.587
PRIORITY OF OURS- AND WE HOPE

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:53.189
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME STRIDES

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:55.224
IN THIS AREA I THINK THE

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:56.960
IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FIVE WILL

00:59:57.026 --> 01:00:01.164
BE HELPFUL BEFORE I JANUARY

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.764

OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:09.505
INCONSISTENT RESULTS AND WITH

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:11.607

FORWARD. WE REALLY HOPE TO HAVE

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:16.379
MORE CONSISTENT OUTCOMES IN

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.047
THESE MATTERS WHICH I THINK

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:25.488
WILL BE HELPFUL. TO EVERYBODY.

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.457
HAVING MORE. AS TO WHAT IS. AND

THEIR BENEFITS TO GET IT- TAKE

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:48.144
THEM IT'S ALSO I THINK

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:50.747
IMPORTANT I. TO AND I SHARED

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.448
WITH THE STATE ON AND SOMEONE

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:54.417
ELSE EDT AT ANOTHER HEARING I

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.719

THEIR INFORMATION WAS ACTUALLY

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:06.262
USED. A FRAUDULENTLY TO COLLECT

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.531
BENEFITS AND I ALSO HAVE TO

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.533
ASSUME THAT JUST AS A MATTER OF

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.404
TIMING THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.472
FOLKS WHO- DID WERE. AND

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:17.540

ALTHOUGH. PRISON MIGHT BE

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:30.086
HARDER TO. RECONCILE BECAUSE IT

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:32.021

GO TO PRISON ON WEDNESDAY- SO.

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:39.662
I ALSO HOPE THAT THERE'S

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:41.798
THOUGHT GIVEN TO THE FACT THAT

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:42.765
YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME FOLKS

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.901
WHO MAY HAVE ENDED UP IN JAIL

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:47.036
OR IN PRISON. MORE LIKELY IN

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:51.007
JAIL- THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:52.842
BENEFITS AND IF THERE ARE WAYS

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:55.044
THAT THOSE CAN BE. TRANSFERRED

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:56.779
I GUESS WITH THEIR APPROVAL OR

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:58.815
SHARED TO FAMILY MEMBERS-

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.950
BECAUSE WHEN FOLKS ARE LOCKED

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:03.519
UP YOU KNOW. THEIR FAMILY-

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.822
MEMBERS ARE ALSO SUFFERING- AS

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:10.726
A RESULT OF THAT PERSON- YOU

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:11.561
KNOW NOT BEING ABLE TO WORK.

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:15.031
I'M I JUST YOU KNOW. WANTED TO

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:18.034
SHARE. WITH YOU THAT.

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.769
UNEMPLOYMENT AND YOU KNOW THIS

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:20.937
I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS FROM OUR

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:23.706
DISCUSSION IS SO IMPORTANT. YOU

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.041
KNOW I REMEMBER GROWING UP MY

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:27.977
MOTHER IS AN ACTRESS AND SO

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:28.544
THAT MEANS SHE'S A SEASONAL

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:30.179
WORKER. AND UNEMPLOYMENT

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:30.913
INSURANCE WAS PART OF OUR

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.315
EXISTENCE I KNEW WHEN SHE

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:34.016
STOPPED WORKING THAT SHE

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.751
STOPPED GETTING A PAYCHECK IN

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:36.953
THE NEXT PAYCHECK SHE WOULD

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.889
GET. QUOTE UNQUOTE PAYCHECK WAS

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:42.325
GONNA COME FROM UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:42.959
AND I KNEW THAT WHEN SHE WAS ON

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.894
ON EMPLOYMENT. WE HAD TO BE

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.529
REALLY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.698
FOOD THAT SHE PURCHASED IN OUR

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:51.134
CONSUMPTION. AND THAT MEANT HOW

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.602
MUCH MORE OFTEN WE WOULD GO TO

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:57.106
THRIFT STORES- AND THE THINGS

01:02:57.173 --> 01:02:57.673
THAT I. DECIDED THAT I WOULD

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.042
ASK FOR. BECAUSE WE COULDN'T

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:02.078
AFFORD. AND WE LIVE WITH

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.013
UNEMPLOYMENT IN OUR LIVES FOR A

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.649
VERY LONG TIME. WHILE I WAS IN

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:08.484
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AND IN

01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:10.486
MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND IN THE

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:13.589
BEGINNING OF HIGH SCHOOL. IT

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.992
WAS PART OF HOW WE SURVIVED.

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:18.361
AND I SHARE THAT BECAUSE I KNOW

01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:20.163
THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:21.764
FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA WILL

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:24.467
PROBABLY HAVE A SIMILAR STORY.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.602
AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF MY

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:29.505
MOM. WAS NOT ABLE TO GET HER

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:33.442
CHECK. THAT SHE NEEDED. TO FEED

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:37.046
HER ONLY CHILD. AND SO I THINK

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:38.915
ABOUT THAT STORY WHEN THE

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:42.418
CONSTITUENTS CALL MY ACTIONS.

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.321
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:50.126
HAPPEN IF WE DIDN'T EIGHT. AND

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:52.428
THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF FOLKS. ARE

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:55.264
HAVING TO DEAL WITH- BUT I

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.600
BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT YOU ALSO

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.069
BELIEVE THAT AND I CAN HEAR IT

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:02.138
IN THE RESPONSES. THAT YOU

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.613
EXAMPLE DEALS WITH THE SUICIDE

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.083

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:15.203
HEALTH- AND HAD BECOME HEALTHY

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.771
AGAIN AND THEN WENT BACK INTO

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:18.773
THE SYSTEM WHERE THESE THINGS

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.642

OUR PRISONS AS FIVE YEARS AFTER

MR ROMERO DIDN'T NEED. A CHECK

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:49.550

ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID DURING

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.143
THAT HEARING IS HOW DO WE

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:18.346

AGO. HE AND- THEY NEVER THOUGHT

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:25.097

IN SPEAK WITH OUR OUR

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:31.237
POPULATION THE WOULD HAVE NEVER

01:58:31.304 --> 01:58:32.605
ENVISIONED THEMSELVES THERE AND

01:58:32.672 --> 01:58:34.974
UNDERSTANDING YOU FOR. OUR OF

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:37.410
REHABILITATION AND SO WE TALK A

01:58:37.477 --> 01:58:40.012
LOT ABOUT GIVING BACK IN THAT

01:58:40.079 --> 01:58:41.714
BE TAKEN SO MUCH FROM SOCIETY

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:43.216
THAT WERE GIVEN HIM AN

01:58:43.282 --> 01:58:44.450
OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE BACK AND

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:46.452
THAT'S THAT GOES A LONG WAY

01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:49.255
FOR- OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT

01:58:49.322 --> 01:58:51.557
TO ME IS AN EMPLOYEE WELLNESS.

01:58:51.624 --> 01:58:54.627
ARMS SAFE SECURE FACILITIES ARE

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:56.095
THOSE ALL IMPORTANT THINGS BUT

01:58:56.162 --> 01:58:58.231
IT ALSO GOES A LONG WAY YOU ARE

01:58:58.297 --> 01:59:00.132
COMMUNITIES INDIVIDUAL IS

01:59:00.199 --> 01:59:01.934
RELEASED BACK IN OUR COMMUNITY

01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:05.304
AND IT IMPACTS. SO MANY PEOPLE

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:06.672
NOT JUST GRAPPLING COURSE

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.608
LEADER PERSON THEY HAVE WIVES

01:59:08.674 --> 01:59:10.510
THEY HAVE HUSBANDS THEY HAVE

01:59:10.576 --> 01:59:18.684
DAUGHTERS. COUSINS FAMILIES.

01:59:18.751 --> 01:59:21.387
FRIENDS THAT THEN WE POSITIVE

01:59:21.454 --> 01:59:25.491
IN ARE COMMUNITY. ARE B. O. B.

01:59:25.558 --> 01:59:27.493
OF THAT HAVE NON WORK. IN THE

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:28.694
COMMUNITIES OF OUR OF OUR

01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:29.562
PRISON SYSTEMS ACTION BENEFIT

01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:33.099
FROM THE LIKE FOOD IN DIFFERENT-

01:59:33.165 --> 01:59:34.767
S. FROM THE INCARCERATED

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:36.702
POPULATION SO I THINK THAT'S

01:59:36.769 --> 01:59:38.704
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RESTORATIVE

01:59:38.771 --> 01:59:40.039
JUSTICE YOU SPOKE ABOUT THAT

01:59:40.106 --> 01:59:41.073

01:59:43.442 --> 01:59:43.976
WELL AND I'M A BIG RESTORATIVE

01:59:44.043 --> 01:59:47.613
JUSTICE- ON AVERAGE IT I THINK

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:49.015
IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I

01:59:49.081 --> 01:59:51.284
THINK HAVING OFTENTIMES FROM A

01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:52.852
DEFENSE PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:54.153
SPEAK ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:56.689
FAIR IN ALL. THE TIMES YOU HEAR

01:59:56.756 --> 01:59:59.792
FROM VICTIMS REYES JR FROM ARM

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:02.662
PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY ON

02:00:02.728 --> 02:00:07.533
CRIMES IN OUR. IN OUR AND

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:08.467
COMMUNITIES AND- THEY NEED THAT

02:00:08.534 --> 02:00:11.070
FOR THEM SO TO ON HIS WAY HE-

02:00:11.137 --> 02:00:13.205
IN ONE PER- SPOKE ABOUT HI

02:00:13.272 --> 02:00:16.842
AUBURN- THAT THEY HAD TO SHOOT

02:00:16.909 --> 02:00:20.146
AMENDS WITH. THE PERSON THAT-

02:00:20.212 --> 02:00:22.348
ARMS VICTIMIZE DAMAGE IN THE

02:00:22.415 --> 02:00:24.050
SAID THAT AFTER THAT THAT THEY

02:00:24.116 --> 02:00:26.552
WERE ABLE TO THE MOVE ON THE IN

02:00:26.619 --> 02:00:27.687
THE IN THE FOUNDER THEY WERE

02:00:27.753 --> 02:00:28.854
CONTINUING TO VICTIMIZE

02:00:28.921 --> 02:00:29.855
THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY GOT THAT

02:00:29.922 --> 02:00:31.624
OPPORTUNITY SO. THERE'S A LOT

02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:33.593
OF GREAT THINGS HERE NOW WITH

02:00:33.659 --> 02:00:35.261

HUMONGOUS THEY ARE IN IN FROM

02:00:58.451 --> 02:00:59.619
MY PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW

WITH NOT ONLY OUR STAFF WRITER

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:07.960
GROCERY I THINK THAT GOES A

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:10.696
LONG WAY. I THINK THAT'S

02:01:10.763 --> 02:01:12.798
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONGOING

02:01:12.865 --> 02:01:21.107
FORWARD SHARK RESEARCH. FOR YOU

02:01:21.173 --> 02:01:21.741
HAVE GIVEN ME THAT OPPORTUNITY.

02:01:21.807 --> 02:01:22.908
THANK YOU I MEAN NOT NOT TO BE

02:01:22.975 --> 02:01:24.844
A PROBABLY A BUT ON BEING AT

ALL PSYCH MAJORS IT THERE A

02:01:26.912 --> 02:01:29.115
GREAT. WHICH IS DECADE OLD NOW

02:01:29.181 --> 02:01:31.217
THE DARK LIKE. THE SKIN. A

02:01:31.283 --> 02:01:32.151
STEADY THAT WAY AND THE PEOPLE

02:01:32.218 --> 02:01:34.086
ARE. WITH AN- OF BILL LERNER

02:01:34.153 --> 02:01:36.355
AND THE WOULD BE. TAKE A LITTLE

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:38.257
LONGER THAT YET LAST MUCH

02:01:38.324 --> 02:01:40.092
LONGER PERHAPS A LIFETIME AND

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.727
THAT THAT'S I THINK WHAT BUT

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:43.562
WHAT THE GOAL IS HERE BUT IT'S

02:01:43.629 --> 02:01:45.231
A VERY DIFFICULT ONE TO OBTAIN.

02:01:45.297 --> 02:01:47.033
WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

02:01:47.099 --> 02:01:48.934
SPENT A LIFETIME ON THE WRONG

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:52.038
SIDE YOU KNOW OF THE LAW AND-

02:01:52.104 --> 02:01:54.473
GROWING U IN A SOCIETY THAT.

02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:56.409
PROBABLY PROMOTES THAT FRANKLY

02:01:56.475 --> 02:01:57.943
WE KNOW THAT WITH THE GAMES

02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:59.345
AND- THE GAMES THAT ARE LISTED

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:01.380
IN HERE YOU GOT YOUR RYAN RYAN

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:04.750
NATION. AS NUMBER ONE- I DON'T

02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:06.185
KNOW WHETHER WAS PUT ON THE TOP

02:02:06.252 --> 02:02:08.087
I THOUGHT THAT WAS. PERHAPS NOT

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:09.555
ACCURATE BECAUSE I THINK SOME

02:02:09.622 --> 02:02:11.323
OF THE LONG TERM. GAINS THAT

02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:12.825
HAVE BEEN THERE ARE ALL

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:15.728
DIFFERENT. WALKS OF LIFE- AND-

02:02:15.795 --> 02:02:17.329
WHAT CRIME THEY'RE INVOLVED

02:02:17.396 --> 02:02:19.098
WITH THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL EQUAL

02:02:19.165 --> 02:02:20.433
AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE A VERY

02:02:20.499 --> 02:02:22.435
DOMINANT ROLE INSIDE THE PRISON

02:02:22.501 --> 02:02:23.803
WALLS SO THEY WOULDN'T BE HIGH

02:02:23.869 --> 02:02:25.371
ON REHABILITATION BECAUSE THEY

02:02:25.438 --> 02:02:27.039
STILL WANT TO MAINTAIN POWER SO

02:02:27.106 --> 02:02:28.507
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:30.576
VERY AWARE OF THAT. THAT LAST

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:32.178
QUESTION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT

02:02:32.244 --> 02:02:33.145
THE FOLKS THAT YOU ARE LETTING

02:02:33.212 --> 02:02:35.748
OUT WITH A- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:37.516
NUMBERS TWENTY THREE THOUSAND

02:02:37.583 --> 02:02:38.751
ORIGINALLY AND NOW WE'RE

02:02:38.818 --> 02:02:39.518
TALKING ABOUT SEVENTY THREE

02:02:39.585 --> 02:02:41.420
THOUSAND. SO WHAT SORT OF

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:43.956
SCREENING IS DONE IN TERMS OF

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:45.691
THESE INDIVIDUALS HOOTERS WHO

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:46.592
SUPPOSEDLY ARE HAVING THEIR

02:02:46.659 --> 02:02:48.794
SENTENCES REDUCED BECAUSE THEY

02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:51.163
HAVE BEEN. THREE REBEL ATTACK

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:54.633
REHABILITATION- AND HAVE A GOOD

02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:57.069
CREDIT FOR. THAT ARE MANY OF

02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:58.571
THEM ARE IN THERE BECAUSE THEY

02:02:58.637 --> 02:03:01.474
USE GUNS. IT USED TO BE USED

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:03.442
AGAIN GO TO GO TO PRISON. AND

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:05.544
IT WHERE THOSE PEOPLE ARE OUT

02:03:05.611 --> 02:03:06.545
AND THEY STILL HAVE THE ACCESS

02:03:06.612 --> 02:03:12.051
TO. A GUN- ILLEGAL GUNS- THAT

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:13.819
IS VERY TROUBLING THAT EVEN

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:20.459
THOUGH THEY'RE. PLAYING THE

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:21.093
GAME YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PER SO

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.094
OF THESE P. WHO ARE. REALLY

02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:23.696
WANTING TO. BE REAL BILL IN TO

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:24.296
GET BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE BUT

02:03:24.363 --> 02:03:25.831
YOU GO A PURSE. OF USING A BELL

02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:27.700
CURVE WHICH IS USED WITH MANY

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:29.201
OF THE STUDIES. THERE ARE THOSE

02:03:29.268 --> 02:03:32.104
WHO PLAINLY GAMING THE SYSTEM.

02:03:32.171 --> 02:03:33.038
IT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE

02:03:33.105 --> 02:03:35.107
SCREENING THAT'S DONE ON THE

02:03:35.174 --> 02:03:36.776
RELEASE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS.

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:39.745
ARE TO REALLY DIG DEEPER IN

02:03:39.812 --> 02:03:41.514
TERMS OF WHAT THEIR CRIMES WERE

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:44.850
IN THEIR ACCESS TO GUNS. AND I

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:45.818
DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF

02:03:45.885 --> 02:03:47.119

02:03:47.186 --> 02:03:48.888
THING I'D LIKE YOU TO INCLUDE.

02:03:58.798 --> 02:04:00.766
SCREENING IS DONE. WITH PEOPLE

OCCASIONS THE MULTIPLE CRIMES

02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:06.372
MAYBE OFFENSE ENHANCEMENTS.

02:04:06.438 --> 02:04:07.873
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:09.742
UNPOPULAR PRESENTLY BUT IF YOU

02:04:09.809 --> 02:04:11.076

THE DIVERSITY THAT WE HAVE

02:15:55.113 --> 02:15:57.215
WITHIN OUR OWN RANKS AND HOW WE

02:15:57.282 --> 02:15:59.217
