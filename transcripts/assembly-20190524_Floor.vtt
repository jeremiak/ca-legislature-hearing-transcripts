FORMER HOUSING GETS BILL.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.375
IT DOES NOT ADD ADDITIONAL RED

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.712

00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:04.434
TO BE DONE AROUND THIS ISSUE.

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:05.869
BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:08.505

FORMER HOUSING.

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:15.846
AND I COULD SPEAK ABOUT IT FROM

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:18.248

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:38.969
BASIC BUT IT WAS DECENT.

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:39.903
AND OUR ROLE OF FARM WORKER

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.605
HOUSING.

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:42.973

OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER LIFE.

00:50:58.455 --> 00:51:00.056
BUT MANY FARMWORKERS THEN AND
