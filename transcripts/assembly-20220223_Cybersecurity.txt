NOW ON TO THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S HEARING THE RECENT STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT ENTITLED STATE HIGH RISK UPDATE INFORMATION SECURITY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT LIMITS THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ENSURE INFORMATION SECURITY. BEFORE I MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS. TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS AS CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS. THANK YOU OUT OF HERE PROCEEDS YOU- INVITING B. AS FOR THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE WE KNOW THAT WE'VE DONE A COUPLE OF HIGH RISK ADULTS OF A OUR CYBER SECURITY NOT ONLY BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN BUT EVEN RECENTLY AS OF THIS YEAR'S REPORT THAT CAME OUT- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY COMPUTERS AND CYBER SECURITY IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF WHAT WE DO EVERY SINGLE DAY. I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE SINCE- I ATTENDED THE TWENTY NINETEEN HEARING- WITH THE STATE AUDITOR OF THE HIGHER RISK- PROGRAM BUT ALSO- TO JUST UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT CYBER SECURITY HOW ARE WE HARDENING OUR SYSTEMS OUT OF SERVICE FOR THE SAY SPECIALLY THOSE WITH INTO THIS AGE WHERE THE STATE IS LOOKING TO INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AS WE BECOME MORE RELIANT ON THE ELECTRIC GRID- WHAT WE DO IS ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN THAT AND PREVENTING OURSELVES FROM CYBER ATTACKS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE WORLD- CONTINUING WITH TO INCREASE I KNOW FOR ME SPECIFICALLY HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW I HAD LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO HAVE. BEEN HELD TO RANSOM WHERE- BECAUSE OF SOME THE CYBER ATTACKS AND YOU KNOW HOW TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. THE CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE BEST. FOR NOT ONLY OUR SCHOOLS. BUT JUST ALL OF OUR STATE AGENTS. ALL OF OUR TO. ARE WHAT'S THE PLAN. HOWEVER WE- HARDING THAT SISTER AND THEN WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO HOPEFULLY PREVENT THESE ATTACKS IN THE FUTURE AND SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING. AND APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND I'M SURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH CHAIR SALAS AS WE BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING. I WANT TO MAKE A FEW OPENING REMARKS MYSELF THE CYBER SECURITY OF ANY ORGANIZATION IS TO IS A DIFFICULT AND EVER DEVELOPING RESPONSIBILITY. DEFENDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S NETWORK AND COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE IS NO SMALL FEAT. WITH THE FEDERATED IN STRUCTURE OF HUNDREDS AND- HUNDREDS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE ENTITIES AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ENDPOINTS TO PROTECT. ADDRESSING THREATS IS NOT ALWAYS A SIMPLE TASK. AND NEW THREATS EMERGE AND ARE IDENTIFIED BY SECURITY PROFESSIONALS EVERY DAY. BUT CYBER SECURITY IS NOT A LUXURY IT IS A NECESSITY. THAT IS WHY THE STATE AUDITOR HAS BEEN REPORTING ON THE STATE'S ASSESS DEFICIENCIES SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. AS A HIGH RISK ISSUE AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN HOLDING HEARINGS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO ADDRESS THEM. DUE TO THE LEGISLATIVE DEADLINES I'VE ALREADY INTRODUCED AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FIVE AND AB TWENTY ONE NINETY. WHICH ARE VEHICLES FOR THE AUDITORS LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS REPORT. I WANT TO NOTE HOWEVER THAT I'M VERY INTERESTED TO LEARN MORE TODAY FROM BOTH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE CDT AND THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD AND REFINE THESE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. AS I HAVE EVEN. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO NOW I WOULD LIKE TO- GO TO THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME AT THE STATE AUDITOR FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ACTING STATE AUDITOR MIKE TILTON AN AUDIT PRINCIPAL BEN WARD. TO COME UP THANK YOU GENTLEMEN. AND WE WILL LISTEN TO YOUR PREPARED REMARKS AND THEN OPEN THE- THE PANEL TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT A GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MISTER SALAS- AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- JUST FOR THE RECORD I'M MIKE TILDEN AND THE ACTING CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. AND JOINING ME IS MISTER BEN WAR HE IS THE AUTHOR PRINCIPLE IN OUR DATA ANALYTICS UNIT. SO I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION- WE HAVE BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT THE STATUS OF THE INFORMATION SECURITY OF STATE ENTITIES AS YOU SAID SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. AND SINCE THEN WE'VE ISSUED FIVE DIFFERENT REPORTS WHERE WE'VE REPORTED ON CONTINUING DEFICIENCIES WITH THE STATE'S INFORMATION SECURITY IN OUR MOST RECENT REPORT THAT WE ISSUED LAST MONTH. WE FOCUS ON CD TEASE OVERSIGHTS OF THE INFORMATION SECURITY- ENTITIES THAT REPORT TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OR THE GOVERNOR THESE ARE THE REPORTING- DEPARTMENTS. AND WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE NOT THAT ARE NOT- REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH C. T. T.'S POLICIES AND GUIDANCE. AND REALLY ASSESS THERE THE- REALLY THE CONDITION OF THEIR SECURITY SYSTEMS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH THEIR OWN- STANDARDS AND FRAMEWORKS. SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO FIRST IS WALK THROUGH. THE FINDINGS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THE REPORTING ENTITIES AND KIND OF TALK YOU THROUGH WHAT WE FOUND. SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THERE AND THEN I'M GONNA WALK THROUGH THE RESULTS OF OUR WORK RELATED TO THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES AND TALK ABOUT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FOUND IN OUR AUDIT IS THAT CDT STILL DOESN'T HAVE. A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATUS OF THE STATE'S INFORMATION SECURITY SO THAT'S- THAT'S BEEN A LONG STANDING PROBLEM. IN ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE TWO OF THE HEARING DOCUMENT THAT I BELIEVE THE SERGEANT PASSED OUT. IT BASICALLY SHOWS THE FOUR YEAR OVERSIGHT. CYCLE THAT CD T. USES THIS IS THEIR- PRIMARY MECHANISM FOR OVERSEEING THE REPORTING ENTITIES. AND THE CONDITION OF THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY. AND THERE ARE TWO KEY COMPONENTS THERE ONE CDT USES THE EVALUATIONS OF THEIR OWN COMPLIANCE AUDITS THAT THEY CONDUCT. AS WELL AS THE RESULTS OF TECHNICAL SECURITY ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY PERFORMED BY THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. THE USE THAT INFORMATION TO CONDUCT THIS SCORE IT'S KNOWN AS A MATURITY METRIC AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT PROVIDES A NUMBER THAT REALLY. DESCRIBES AND SUMMARIZES EACH ENTITY IS THE STATUS OF THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY DEVELOPMENT. SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CALCULATION. BUT WE FOUND. YOU KNOW WERE INTO REALLY THE FOURTH YEAR OF THE OVERSIGHT CYCLE AND SO AT THIS POINT CD T. SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED AUDITS. AND CALCULATED MATURITY METRICS FOR THIRTY NINE ENTITIES BUT THEY REALLY ONLY COMPLETED THIRTEEN AUDITS. AND THEY'VE ONLY CALCULATE EIGHTEEN OF THESE IMPORTANT MATURITY METRICS. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS NGUYEN CDT ESTABLISH THIS FOUR YEAR OVERSIGHT LIFECYCLE THE PLAN WAS THAT THEY HAD THE BAND WITH OR THE RESOURCES TO REVIEW. THIRTEEN ENTITIES A YEAR AND THAT'S HOW THEY CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT. THEY COULD LOOK AT THE FIFTY TWO HIGHEST RISK REPORTING ENTITIES OVER THE FIRST FOUR YEARS. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE LIFE CYCLES ARE ONLY AVERAGING TEN COMPLIANCE AUDITS A YEAR SO THEY'VE GOTTEN BEHIND- SO OUR RECOMMENDATION THERE IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IN THAT IS THAT. CD T. REALLY NEEDS TO INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY TO COMPLETE THESE COMPLIANCE AUDITS OF THE HIGHER RISK ENTITIES IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER. AND SO IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH CDT WHAT THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA REQUIRE IS THEY'RE GONNA NEED TO HIRE MORE STAFF OR THE NEED TO- SECURE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTRACTED AUDIT SUPPORT. I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE FOUR YEAR- OVERSIGHT LIFECYCLE THOSE TWO COMPONENTS THE COMPLIANCE SITES IN THE TECHNICAL SECURITY ASSESSMENTS. THE TECHNICAL SECURITY ASSESSMENTS THOSE ARE REQUIRED BY STATE LAW. TO HAPPEN THIRTY FIVE DEPARTMENTS EVERY YEAR HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THESE TECHNICAL. SECURITY ASSESSMENTS AND AS I SAID THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT IS GENERALLY PERFORMING THOSE EVALUATIONS AND THOSE ARE HAPPENING AND HAPPENING AS REQUIRED SO THAT'S NOT PART OF THE DELAY THE DELAY IS REALLY ABOUT CITIES COMPLIANCE AUDITS. SECOND THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT. FOR THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE ARE UNDER CD TEASE PURVIEW AS WE SHOW ON PAGE THREE. THOSE ENTITIES RELIEVE THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS REALLY NOT IMPROVED AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO FALL BELOW BOTH FEDERAL STANDARDS AND STATE STANDARDS. SO LET ME TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL STANDARDS FIRST. EVERY YEAR REPORTING ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED TO. CONDUCT THIS FEDERAL SELF ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY. IT'S CALLED THE NATION WIDE REVIEW AND THE PRIMARY REASON. THAT THE STATE I THINK REQUIRES THESE ENTITIES TO CONDUCT THE SELF ASSESSMENT. IS THAT IT'S OF IT'S A MECHANISM FOR THE STATE TO GET FEDERAL GRANTS FOR INFORMATION SECURITY RESULTS OF THE SELF ASSESSMENTS WE FOUND OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE REALLY FALLING BELOW THOSE FEDERAL MINIMUM STANDARDS IN AGAIN. THAT'S BEEN CONSISTENT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THEY'RE NOT HITTING THOSE FEDERAL BENCHMARKS. THE OTHER THING THAT WE LOOKED OUT AND WE DEPICT ON PAGE THREE IS THESE MATURITY METRICS THAT I TALKED ABOUT EVEN THOUGH CDT HAS ONLY CONDUCTED- SEVENTEEN OF THOSE FOR REPORTING ENTITIES FOR ELEVEN OF THOSE THEY'VE SUBSEQUENTLY CONDUCTED FOLLOW UP REVIEWS OR THEY'VE HAD SUBSEQUENT TECHNICAL SECURITY ASSESSMENTS. SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE RECALCULATE THE MATURITY METRICS SO WE LOOKED AT THAT. BECAUSE IT WE HOPE TO SEE IS THAT OVER TIME THE MATURITY METRIC SCORES WOULD BE IMPROVING BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T SEE THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPHIC OF THOSE ELEVEN ENTITIES THAT HAVE HAD. MORE THAN ONE- CALCULATION THE MATURITY METRIC SCORE ONLY THREE SHOWED ANY IMPROVEMENT. AND FOR SIX OF THE ELEVEN THEIR SCORES ACTUALLY DECLINED WHICH IS. WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY DISAPPOINTING. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS. THESE TECHNICAL SECURITY ASSESSMENTS WE LOOK AT A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE OF THOSE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO KIND OF ISOLATE THAT AND FIGURE OUT. ARE THE DEPARTMENTS ARE THE IMPROVING FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THESE MORE TECHNICAL SECURITY ASSESSMENTS. SO WE LOOK AT THESE FOR THE PERIOD OF JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE STATE ENTITIES ARE SCORING. FIFTY FOUR OUT OF A HUNDRED POSSIBLE POINTS. AND THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. THEY BASICALLY ARE INDICATING THAT A SCORE OF NINETY OR HIGHER IS THE DESIRED RANGE SO OBVIOUSLY. THESE REPORTING ENTITIES ARE WAY BELOW THAT THRESHOLD AND AGAIN OVER THIS. THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT WE LOOKED AT THEIR PERFORMANCE REALLY REMAINED FLAT. SO THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT IS THAT THE INFORMATION THAT CD T. DOES HAVE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF REPORTING ENTITIES THEY'RE REALLY NOT DOING A GOOD JOB OF PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THE ON THE MATURITY METRIC SCORES OR HOW THOSE ARE CHANGING AND THEY'RE ALSO NOT PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION ON. THE STATE DEPARTMENT'SPERFORMANCE ON THESE FEDERAL SELF ASSESSMENTS. YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND THAT AREAS OF THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REQUIRE CDT TO CONFIDENTIALLY SUBMIT AN ANNUAL STATEWIDE INFORMATION SECURITY STATUS REPORT. IN THAT STATUS REPORT SHOULD INCLUDE THESE MATURITY METRIC SCORES AND THE RESULTS OF THE SELF REPORTED EVALUATIONS- IN THAT INFORMATION WE THINK NEEDS TO BE GOING TO THE APPROPRIATE- LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP. SO IN THE AREA OF THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES. I THINK SIMILAR TO WHAT WE REPORTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE'RE STILL FINDING THAT THESE NON REPORTING ENTITIES ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH THEIR OWN SHOWS AN INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE WHEN WE SURVEY THIRTY TO THESE NON REPORTING ENTITIES WE FOUND THAT ONLY FOR THESE ENTITIES HAD ACHIEVED FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR CHOSEN INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS WHICH IS WHICH IS NOT GOOD. AND WE ALSO FOUND THAT THREE OF THESE NON REPORTING ENTITIES HAD NOT EVEN ADOPTED ANY INFORMATION SECURITY FRAMEWORK OR STANDARDS AT ALL. AND SO I THINK CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE SET BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WE FOUND THAT THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES THERE CURRENTLY IS NO COMPREHENSIVE EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT MECHANISM OTHER INFORMATION SECURITY STATUS. AND WE FOUND THAT WHEN THERE IS THIS EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT IT IMPROVES INFORMATION SECURITY PERFORMANCE. SO GIVEN THAT BACKDROP AND JUST THE FACT THAT THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE REALLY FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS REMAINED STAGNANT THEY REALLY HAVEN'T MADE ANY PROGRESS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN TERMS OF IMPROVING THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY SO GIVEN THAT WE LOOKED AT A COUPLE OF- OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR. IMPROVING THAT AND ONE OF THOSE WAS WE CONSIDERED HAVING MAKING A RECOMMENDATION THAT MAYBE CD T. SHOULD START MONITORING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES- BUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT IS AS I JUST DESCRIBED. THE CD TEES OVERSIZED REPORTING ENTITIES THEMSELVES HAS SO FAR BEEN INADEQUATE AND I'M NOT SURE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TAKE ON THIS ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY- IN ADDITION AS I SAID BEFORE C. T. DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE. NON REPORTING ENTITIES TO COMPLY WITH THEIR WITH THEIR STANDARDS UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THE PAST THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT REPORTING TO CD T. THAT SOMEHOW IT WOULD IMPEDE ON THEIR INDEPENDENCE. SO GIVEN ALL THAT. WHAT WE THINKS MAKE SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE NON REPORTING ENTITIES EVERY NOT REPORTING ENTITY. TO FORMALLY ADOPT INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS AND A FRAMEWORK BECAUSE WE'RE STILL SEEING SOME ENTITIES LIKE SAID THAT HAVE NOT YET DONE THAT. AND THAT ALSO EVERY NON REPORTING ENTITY SHOULD ANNUALLY PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON ITS COMPLIANCE WITH ITS ADOPTED STANDARDS- TO LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN- THE OVERSIGHT OF THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES. IS WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE AN AUDIT OF THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY AT LEAST EVERY THREE YEARS. AND WE FEEL THAT THE LEGISLATURE MOVES FOR WITH RECOMMENDATION. THEN REALLY IT WOULD HAVE A SORT OF A STATE WIDE VIEW OF HOW ALL THE STATE% ENTITIES ARE DOING IN TERMS OF THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY BECAUSE THAT WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE INFORMATION ON. HOW THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES ARE DOING ANY FOR OTHER RICK RECOMMENDATION IS IMPLEMENTED FOR THE REPORTING ENTITIES YOU HAVE THAT FULL BASICALLY THAT FULL. SCOPE OF INFORMATION ON HOW ALL THE STATE'S ENTITIES ARE DOING IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THEIR DATA. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE OR DRILL DOWN INTO ANY AREA IN MORE DETAIL THANK YOU- THANK YOU MR TELL THEM OR ARE YOU SPEAKING THIS REPORT- YEAH I I'M HERE TO HELP YOU OKAY- ALL RIGHT AND I JUST WANNA SAY I I'D HAVE TO SAY THIS WITH THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES ITS NOT LIKE WE HAVEN'T BEEN TRYING FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. SO WE WILL CONTINUE AND PERHAPS THIS TIME THE LIGHT WILL GO ON AYE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO. WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER- VOEPEL AND SO I HAVE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU- ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END BUT I DO HAVE ONE OF ONE QUESTION- FOR RIGHT NOW. SO OF REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL CYBERSECURITY POSTURE YOUR OUR AUDIT FOCUSED ON ASSESSING AGAINST OUR OWN- POLICY AND STANDARDS CAN YOU COMMENT ON HOW CALIFORNIA COMPARES TO OTHER STATES- I MEAN PUTTING PUTTING ANOTHER WHERE WE FALLING BEHIND BECAUSE CALIFORNIA- POLICY- IS TO MEET HIGH STANDARDS WHILE OUR PEERS. DO NOT MEET THOSE HIGH STANDARDS OR DO WE FALL BEHIND OUR PEERS WHO HAVE ALSO ADOPTED THESE HIGH STANDARDS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE LOOKED AT THAT BUT- AT LEAST START WITH THAT ONE SURE I THINK I CAN GET STARTED WITHOUT SHORTER ONE MY UNDERSTANDING AND MISTER WORKING OUT TO THIS. IS THAT I MEAN THE STATE STANDARDS THAT ARE IN THE SAN MANUEL THEY CLOSELY MIRROR THERE AT THE RELEVANT THIS STANDARDS AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND EVEN AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THERE ARE BROADLY COMPARE A BULL SO WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PARTICULAR STANDARDS THAT CDT IS REQUIRING THE REPORTING. ENTITIES TO COMPLY WITH. DID YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT THE STORE. YES- SO WHEN WE AT THE NEW WIDE REVIEW. WE IS THE FEDERAL SELF ASSESSMENT THAT- IS PART OF RECEIVING GRANT FUNDING. SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS OUT INFORMATION RELATED TO HOW ENTITIES OR HOW GOVERNMENTS DO ACROSS LIKE A BROAD RANGE. AND WE FOUND THAT WE PERFORM FAIRLY COMPARABLY WITH OTHER STATE- GOVERNMENTS AREN'T ON THAT REVIEW SO. I WOULD SAY THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE- AND IT BUT WE'RE FOLLOWING VERY SIMILAR STANDARDS A LOT OF THE STANDARDS ARE CLOSELY MIRROR. EACH OTHER AND- FOR PERFORMING ABOUT THE SAME WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY BELOW THAT FEDERALLY RECOMMENDED LEVEL. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS KNOW JUST LOOKING AFTER GRAPHIC HERE. AND THE OF THE FIFTY TWO ENTITIES THE TO RATIFIED IN THE HIGHER RISK- PROVIDE STANDING IS THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHT ENTITIES. RIGHT AND SO YOU HAVE FIFTY TWO WE ACTUALLY HAVE DATA ON AND THEN ON THE FIFTY TWO- C. D. T. ONLY COMPLETED THIRTY ONE OF THE THIRTY NINE OUT ITS SHOULD HAVE FINISHED. AND THEN IT ONLY DID MATURITY METRIC SCORES FOR ONLY SEVENTEEN OF THOSE. SO THEY'VE DONE LESS THAN HALF THE WORK THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT. AND EVEN OF THOSE THEY'VE DONE EVEN LESS WORK. IN TERMS OF THE AUDIT NOW WHEN YOU WERE GOING THROUGH ALL OF THIS AND POINTING ALL OF THIS OUT JUST BY THE METRICS. WHAT WAS THE REASON CDT GAVE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO. MEET THE EXPECTATIONS. HI MISTER SALAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CDT MENTIONED IS THAT WHEN THEY INITIALLY DEVELOPED THE FOUR YEAR HIGH RISK CYCLE MINOR SAYING IS THE INCLUDED SOME NON REPORTING ENTITIES IN THAT SCOPE AND APPARENTLY WHEN THEY PLAN OUT THESE AUDITS THE PLAN THESE THINGS I GUESS MONTHS IN ADVANCE THE COME UP WITH AN AUDIT PLAN. IN ONE OTHER EXPLANATIONS WAS THAT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO CONDUCT THE AUDIT SOME OF THESE NON REPORTING ENTITIES THAT WERE LIKE A PART OF THEIR AUDIT PLAN DECIDED NOT TO PARTICIPATE AND SO CITIES EXPLANATION WAS THAT BECAUSE THAT HAPPENED LATE IN THE GAME THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO LINE UP OTHER- BASICALLY OTHER DEPARTMENTS FOR AN AUDIT SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE EXPLANATIONS THAT THEY HAD. AND THEN OTHERWISE OUR UNDERSTANDING WAS THEY JUST REALLY WEREN'T STAFFED UP TO DO THIRTEEN OF THESE A YEAR WHICH WAS THEIR ORIGINAL PLAN OVER THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THIS FOUR YEAR LIFE CYCLE THEY'RE AVERAGING ONLY TEN SO WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT THAT AND ASK THEM IS IT A QUESTION OF DO THEY NEED MORE STAFF DO THEY NEED CONTRACTED STAFF. AND- THEY THEY THEY KIND OF RESPONDED THAT THE- I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY REALLY HAD A GREAT EXPLANATION FOR WHY THEY WEREN'T ON PASTY EVERYTHING TO ADD TO THAT MISTER WORD SO- THERE IS THE NON REPORTING ISSUE THAT. CAUSE SOME DELAYS ANOTHER DELAY ESPECIALLY THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE THIRTY ONE AUDITS IN THE EIGHTEEN MATURITY METRICS SEVENTEEN OF WHICH WERE REPORTING ENTITIES THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE AUDIT REQUIREMENTS SO ALTHOUGH THE MATURITY METRIC SCORING WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE FOUR YEAR CYCLE STARTED. IT INCLUDED- NEW CONTROLS BASED ON A REVISION OF NESS THEY INCLUDED PRIVACY CONTROLS- THOSE CONTROLS WEREN'T INCLUDED IN THAT FIRST YEAR AUDIT PROGRAM SO THEY FINISHED THE NUMBER OF AUDITS- NINE AUDITS THAT. THEY ACTUALLY CAN'T CALCULATE THE MATURITY METRICS ON EVEN THOUGH THE CRITERIA WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE AUDITS- AND THAT'S CAUSED A DELAY. IN AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THEY GO BACK IN. AND SCORE THOSE ON THE PRIVACY CONTROL SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO CALCULATE THE MATURITY METRICS RATHER PRODUCT NIGHT- PRECIADO BUT YOU KNOW. WE HAVE A AND EIGHT REPORTING ENTITIES AND THEN WHEN I EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES AND I DON'T WANT TO FUSE THE TWO. BUT EVEN OF YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES EVEN OF THOSE. YOU KNOW. THEY'VE ONLY YOU ONLY HAVE PARTIAL INFORMATION FOR TWENTY FOUR OF THEM. RIGHT AND THAT'S NOT EVEN COUNTING ALL OF THEM SO I'M JUST CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THEY TOLD. THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WHY THEY WEREN'T COMPLIANT WHAT THE ISSUE WAS YOU ASKED IF IT WAS STAFFING- I DON'T THINK IT WAS A DEFINITIVE ANSWER. AS TO WHY THAT WAS- WOULD WE CALL THEM UP I'D LOVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION. BUT BUT NO I APPRECIATE THAT THE- YEAH I DID WANT TO ASK- FOR THE NON. THE NON COMPLIANT REPORTING. WHO'S ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE IS CVT RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE I KNOW IN THE PAST I THINK AND PASSED HEARING THEY SAID- THEY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WERE YOU GUYS ABLE TO LOOK INTO- HOW DO WE- BRIDGE THAT GAP. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CD T. DOESN'T HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES. I MEAN THESE ARE LARGELY- CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH- SO THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE CDC'S REQUIREMENTS THEIR POLICIES THEIR PROCEDURES. SO I THINK THE WAY I MEAN IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH C. T. THEY JUST THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AT THE MOMENT OVER THIS NOT REPORTING ENTITIES FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY- YOU MENTIONED EARLIER MR TELL THEM ABOUT THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS OF. IN YOUR AUDIT WERE YOU ABLE TO IDENTIFY HOW MANY TIMES- THERE WAS POSSIBLE DATA BREACHES ARE THERE WAS AN ACTUAL DATA BREACH. AND HE DRIVES AND THAT'S PART OF THE METRIC BUT HOW MANY TIMES IS THAT CORRECTED YOU KNOW ARE WE ARE IS A DEPARTMENT DOING IS CD T. DOING EVERYTHING IN. YOUR OPINION THAT THEY NEED TO DO TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S PRIVACY. SO WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION A REPORT ABOUT SOME- EVENTS THAT HAPPENED SOME CYBER SECURITY EVENTS THAT HAPPENED I THINK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR- BUT MR WORKING PROBABLY HAD MORE DETAIL HERE MY UNDERSTANDING FROM WHAT WE DID. IS WE WERE REALLY LOOKING AT. THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE REPORTING IN THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES HAD POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. IN PLACE THAT WOULD PROPEL PROTECT THEIR INFORMATIONAL DATA. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE DID ANY DRILL DOWN WORK OR DENSIFIED ANY ACTUAL- CYBER SECURITY EVENTS IS THAT CORRECT MR WORD YET SO WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE- THE RESPONSE TO CYBER SECURITY EVENTS OR OR THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE- WE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON. CD'S OVERSIGHT WHICH INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE EVALUATED THROUGH THE- AUDIT PROGRAMS ALSO HIGHLY TECHNICAL- MILITARY ASSESSMENTS. THERE ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL BUT WE DIDN'T GO IN AND EVALUATE THAT WE LOOKED AT WHAT WAS BEING DONE TO EVALUATE. AND ENTITIES AND ARE THEY ARE THEY IMPROVING ARE THEY NOT AND WE FOUND THAT THEY WERE NOT IT SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE POLICY AND GUIDELINES AS OPPOSED TO HOW MANY RANSOMWARE ATTACKS. OR FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW LIKE I- SEMI OPEN COMMENTS I HAD A SCHOOL JUST THAT WAS A SUBJECT TO ONE OF THOSE AND YOU KNOW WE READ ABOUT IT IN THE NATIONAL NEWS AS WELL WHETHER IT WAS A- COLONIAL COLONIAL- PIPELINE RANSOMWARE FOR INSTANCE. OR ANY OF THE OTHERS- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE CARE A LOT ABOUT DATA PROTECTING PEOPLE'S PRIVACY. RIGHT EDT. AND ALL OF THE FRAUD THAT'S OCCURRING THERE SO. JAI THAT THEY COULD NOT ENTER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. MADAM CHAIR AMOUNT. WAS SCHEDULED IN TO BE HERE- AS PART OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEES SO I GUESS I'M IT FOR THEM JUST BY DEFAULT. SO I HAVE GREAT RESPECT AUDITORS YOU DID A EXCELLENT JOB HERE QUANTIFYING THE DATA. NOW HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA KIND OF GET OFF INTO THE DEEP END SO PLEASE INDULGE ME. WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS I COULD PUT TOGETHER INTO ANY. CYBER SECURITY THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TRUST ME IF THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN AUDIT THAT WOULD BE GREAT SO THE POINT I'M MAKING IS IT'S LIKE IN A MILITARY MILITARY HAS WAR GAMES IN ORDER TO TEST THEIR SYSTEMS THEN THEY DO. A QUICK AND DIRTY BRIEFING TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG WHAT WENT RIGHT. WHAT I RECOMMEND. IS WE FOLLOW UP MADAM CHAIR. WITH THE LEGAL PACKING COMMITTEE TO HACK KINDLE THE SYSTEMS. AND THAT WAY YOU KNOW. WHERE THE WEAKNESSES ARE IT BECOMES REAL LIFE TO EACH ENTITY THAT YOU VOTED VERY WELL SO. WHAT'S INTERESTING IF. WE PUT TOGETHER A PACKING COMMITTEE OF KIDS THEY'RE ALL KIDS- I'M SERIOUS WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS IF YOU GAVE THEM THE GO AHEAD TO DO IT LEGALLY THEY WOULD BE IN EVERY. ORGANIZATION AND- UNDER SUPERVISION. MAYBE ADULT SUPERVISION EVEN WHO KNOWS. ANYWAY THAT'S MY COMMENTS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO JUST- FOLLOW UP ON THAT THAT IS SO YOU MENTIONED OF THE PEN TESTING THAT THE- SECURITY ASSESSMENTS DONE MOSTLY BY THE- THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT AND THAT THEY ARENOT NECESSARILY THOSE TESTS ARE THE RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY IMPROVING BUT IT COULD BE THE RESULT OF. ADDITIONAL VULNERABILITIES AND LACK OF PATCHING RIGHT SO NOT NECESSARILY ANY ISSUE WITH WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING I MEAN IT COULD BE SOME OF IT COULD BE WHETHER DEPARTMENT IS DOING BETTER OR WORSE BUT SOME OF THE CALLS OF THE- ARE VULNERABILITIES THAT WERE DISCOVERED BY. ME BASICALLY THAT THEY ARE DOING HACKING RIGHT. THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT IS. BASICALLY DOING HAPPEN WHEN THEY DO THE TESTING. DOES THAT MEAN THE COULD THAT BE WHAT ARE THE REASONS THAT THE THOSE- SECURITY BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE- KEEPING UP ON THOSE. ACCORDING TO- THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED SO WHAT ARE REASONS THAT THOSE TESTS MIGHT GO DOWN YEAH I MEAN THAT'S THE THING WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE RESULTS OF THE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS THAT AS YOU SAY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT MILITARY CONDUCTS. I MEAN THERE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN GUIDELINES THE GOAL IS FOR THESE DEPARTMENTS TO SCORE IN THIS NINETY TO A HUNDRED RANGE. AND SO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE HITTING ABOUT FIFTY FOUR OUT OF A HUNDRED OVER ALL THREE YEARS FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY- IS TROUBLING SO THEY'RE A LONG WAYS FROM THE MARK AND I THINK. BASED ON. OTHER STUFF THAT WE DID IN THE AUDIT THAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT IT SEEMS LIKE THE DISCONNECT IS THAT MANY OF THESE DEPARTMENTS THEY HAVE. INFORMATION SECURITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THEY HAVE LAID THAT FOUNDATIONAL GROUNDWORK. BUT THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO A PLACE WHERE THEY'VE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THOSE POLICIES PROCEDURES AND THOSE PRACTICES. SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHY THEY'RE NOT DOING VERY WELL ON THE- THE- TECHNICAL SECURITY ASSESSMENTS. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE TO ADD TO THAT MISTER WARD ABOUT THOSE ASSESSMENTS. I THINK THAT'S AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION- THE THREATS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING- BUT THAT'S WHAT CAN BE THE VALUE OF THOSE MATURITY METRICS OR STANDARD SCORE RANGES SO. YESTERDAY YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO NEW TYPES OF THREATS BUT- THERE SCORING SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THAT. THAT DESIRED RANGE BOTH IN. THE TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS AND- SELF ASSESSMENTS AND- AUDITS THAT LOOK MORE AT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. OUR RIGHTS- THANK YOU GENTLEMEN AND YOU'LL STAY TILL THE END- SO WE CAN ASK MORE QUESTIONS OUR RIGHTS- WE ARE GOING TO. MOVE ON TO A DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU RESPOND TO SOME OF THE FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT FROM THE AUDIT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME. OF FROM CD T. RUST AND- NICHOLS THE ACTING DIRECTOR AND STATE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AND OF THE TOLLY PANACHE. BUT I GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME THE POLICY. PRIOR DAY. IT AT THE STATE THAT EACH OF HER SECURITY OFFICER IT WAS ALL. CLOSE I ALWAYS HAVE A FIFTY FIFTY TWO. OF THANK YOU FOR JOINING US GENTLEMEN. WE WILL LISTEN TO YOUR UP PREPARED REMARKS AND THEN OPENED THE PANEL UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WITHIN THANK YOU. SURE SAUSAGE WELL AND TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY- I AM REST NICHOLS ON THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. BOB TELEPICTURES STATE ISO- IS ALSO HERE WITH US AND WE'LL GO THROUGH A MOVE BIT ABOUT. THE OVERALL PROGRAM AND SOME OF THE REALLY THE CS WORKING THE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT- ASPECT OF STATE IN MY THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN STATE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENT MORE AND MORE TECHNOLOGY TO THE POINT THAT IT IS NOW IN IRAQ IN MOST OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT MAKES OUR STATE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY WORK AT ITS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE ARE OUT. WITH THAT STARBURST ACUITY AS CHAIR OR ONE OUT IS QUICKLY- MATURING DEVELOP AND THE THREAT LANDSCAPE THAT'S IN FRONT OF US IS VERY COMPLEX AND VERY BROAD BECAUSE OF THAT CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM THAT MR AND IT'S RUNS POOREST IS BURIED HAS MANY AND SCO AUTO FOCUSES ON ONE COMPONENT OR ONE SLICE OF THAT PIE WHICH IS THE SECURITY AUDIT PROCESS THAT WE OUGHT. SO. NEVER SALAS- POINTED OUT THAT WE HAVE REALLY OVERHEAD AD FIFTY ENTITIES AND STAY. ABOUT A HUNDRED NAVAL HUNDRED OUR GOALS ARE UNDER THE AUTHORITY THE GOVERNOR MOST OF THE THAT WE HAVE. BOTH OF THE STORY AND RESPONSE OF THE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATELY APPLY SECURE PRACTICE WITHIN THAT WE PER NARROWED DOWN GROUP TO BE FIFTY TWO HI SICK I RISK TYPE ENTITIES THAT WE REALLY ARE EXERCER THE AUDIT ALL THE OTHER HAND OF THAT GROUP THE MEMBERS OF THE WHITE OH EIGHT THAT ARE AT RISK R. AND I LOWER. OF A SET THIS GET THE MORE ASSESSMENTS THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE AUDIT PRO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE I- SIX THAT ARE OUT AND AS AS YOU CAN IN CYBER ONCE I FITS ALL IS NOW APPROPRIATE THE ACTUAL THAT WE FOR SYSTEMS THAT PERSONAL. AND HELP. OR STATE OFFICE LOCATIONS SO IT IS A TIERED MECHANISM INTENTIONALLY AND SO AS WE CONDUCT THESE AUDITS AND ACTUALLY I THINK MISTER TOLD AN ACCIDENT- SPOKE YOU SEPARATE COMPLETED THIRTEEN THE NUMBER IS ACTUALLY THIRTY ONE AT ONE ONE OF THOSE AUDITS OF MISTER CELLS ACTUALLY CORRECTED THAT AS WELL- AS WE GO THROUGH THOSE AUDITS WE HAVE STAFF TO OUR PROGRAM TO CONDUCT- ESSENTIALLY A QUARTER OF THOSE AUDITS OF HIGH RISK ENTITIES EACH YEAR. ON A FOUR YEAR CYCLE. IT IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT THAT AUDIT REALLY IS PROCESS AND PROCEDURE AUDITS AND THE POLICY HUNDRED OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS IT IS NOT MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE EXECUTION OF THOSE POLICIES M. S. AS MR BALL JOINTED OUT YEAH WE DO HAVE THE MILITARY ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY COMING IN AND INTENTIONALLY TRY. TO OPT. BREAK THROUGH AND ENTER THOSE SYSTEMS AND EXERCISE THAT BUT THAT IS REALLY NOT THE FOCUS OF THIS REPORT- SO THAT THE PROGRAM IN SUMMARY IS VERY BROAD WE'RE FOCUSING ON JUST. ONE PIECE AS WE TALK THROUGH THIS. D. OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO OUT IS OUR THREAT LANDSCAPE IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING AGAIN BECAUSE WE USE SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY BUT THE STATE OF THE WORLD IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING JUST SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS AGAINST OUR SYSTEMS QUADRANT. WE MEASURE THAT THROUGH- MR PARRISH'S OFFICE IN THROUGH THE- CALIFORNIA CYBER SECURITY IMMIGRATION CENTER THAT WE THAT WE OPERATE IN COORDINATION WITH WE ASKED WITH CHP. OUR MILITARY THAT IS A VERY TACTICAL AND OPERATIONAL COMPONENT OF CYBER SECURITY THAT IS KIND OF THE FRONT LINE UPDATED DATE. MONITORING AND REACTION TO CYBER EVENTS IN THE WORLD AND EVEN IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK YOU SEE INCREASED. TENSIONS AND CONCERNS. WE ADJUSTING FOR QUICK. TO RESPOND TO THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE NOT POLICY ADJUSTMENTS CLOSER ALL ADJUSTMENTS ARE TACTIC WHEN I WE SECURITY FENCE THE MESSAGING WE PUT OUT OUR- AND THE MANAGEMENT OR INFORMATION SECURE. SO BLACK NETWORK OF THAT WE DO. SO WITH THAT THE TERM- THE THINGS OVER TO MR AND H. AS HE CAN WALK THROUGH LITTLE MORE ON OUR STREETS PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN CS. SO THE BALLOT. YES THANK YOU RUSS GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HOW THE TALIBAN ITS STATE CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE MUCH NEEDED FOCUS ON CYBER SECURITY. THE GOAL OF OUR APPROACH IS REALLY RISK BASED TO MAKE OURSELVES MORE DIFFICULT TARGETED AT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND EVERY STEP OF THE ATTACK. ALL AT THE SAME TIME IS STRIVING TOWARDS OUR COMPLIANCE GOALS. FIRST BEFORE WE DIE THEN I WANTED TO SUMMARIZE AND FIRST GO INTO VANITY THREAT LANDSCAPE AS IT'S APPALLING. AND THE NUMBER TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE WAYS THAT WE MEASURE POSTURE AS WELL AS- WHAT WE HAVE DONE TO DIRECTLY. BENEFIT AND HELP THE ENTITIES BECOME A MORE DIFFICULT TARGET AND DIRECTLY DEAL WITH IMMINENT THREATS DEALING WITH THE PANDEMIC. AND THE NUMBER THREE DISCUSS OF CSA'S VALUABLE INPUT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO OR OVERSIGHT EFFORTS AS WE WORK MUTUALLY TO PROGRESS AND PUSH THE BALL FORWARD. FIRST TO REITERATE THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE THREAT LANDSCAPE. WE ARE TRACKING NEARLY OVER NINETEEN HUNDRED CRIMINAL AND NATION STATE THREAT ACTORS ALONG WITH FIVE HUNDRED PLUS NEW MALWARE SAMPLES OR NEW MALWARE FAMILIES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NATIONALLY RANSOMWARE SOARED BY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE PERCENT. FISHING WAS UP BY TWENTY TWO PERCENT. OF THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN IN OVER THEFT AND A 13% INCREASE IN PHISHING BASED ATTACKS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN SIXTY SIX ZERO DAY VULNERABILITIES. OR VULNERABILITIES THAT THE THAT WERE DISCLOSED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT DID NOT HAVE FIXES. UPON THE TIME OF THIS CLOSURE. THIS WAS UP BY TWENTY FIVE OR FROM TWENTY FIVE LAST YEAR. WE ALSO SAW EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY NINE SECURITY VULNERABILITIES DISCLOSED GENERALLY MORE THAN THAN ANY YEAR. DEBATE BUT WE'VE ALSO WITNESSED AN INCREASED RECONNAISSANCE AND DISCOVERY ACTIVITY TARGETING OR WORDS THE TECH THAT ARE BY BY OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS EFFORTS. ASSISTING NEARLY FORTY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DAILY SIGNALS WE'VE ALSO SEEN AN AMPLITUDE IN THE NATION STATE SPONSORED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS TARGETED AT OUR NETWORKS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE PANDEMIC OPENED NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVERSARIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION INCLUDING REMOTE WORK ENVIRONMENTS AS A RESULT THE CDT. EMPLOYED IMMEDIATE MEASURES TO ENABLE ALL DEPARTMENTS TO DEAL WITH THE PANDEMIC SAFELY AND SECURELY WHILE MAINTAINING CLOSE FOCUS AND SECURITY OVERSIGHT. MITIGATED THREAT ACTORS ATTEMPTING TO EXPLOIT AND DISRUPT. THE OPPORTUNITIES AROUND EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS. AND THEN AS OVER A COURSE OF A MONTH DURING THE PANDEMIC THE STATE HAS SHIFTED ITS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. REMOTE WORKFORCE TO BEING TELEWORK ENABLED. WHILE DOING SO WE PERFORMED AND SCALE THEIR TEAMS TO CONDUCT POINTED RAPID ASSESSMENTS OF ALL DEPARTMENTAL REMOTE WORK RESOURCES. SO THIS INCLUDED. PENETRATION TESTING HOME ENVIRONMENTS AND LOOKING FOR IMMEDIATELY EXPLOITABLE VULNERABILITIES THAT OUR TEAMS-COLLECTIVELY WORKED ON AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS REMEDIATE. OUR TEAMS ALSO WERE PRIORITIZED OFFICIALS CONSOLIDATED AND THEN IT WOULD JUST X. REPORTING VACCINE MANAGEMENT. AND ALL WITH SECURITY AND PRIVACY PRESERVING PRACTICES IN MIND. THIS DIRECTLY RESULTED IN RELEASING DOZENS OF CODE RELATED APPLICATIONS AND DASHBOARDS TO SUPPORTER DEPARTMENTS. IN ADDITION CDT PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ESTABLISHING THE CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY INNOVATION CENTER OR AS WE CALL CAL SICK. THROUGH THE CAL SIXTY T. PROVIDES A DEDICATED THREAT INTELLIGENCE RESPONSE TEAM TO ASSIST STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES IN DEALING WITH IMMEDIATE IN IMMINENT THREATS RESULTING FROM ATTACKS SUCH A SOPHISTICATED RANSOMWARE SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS AND SOPHISTICATED IDENTITY THEFT. AS PART OF THE CAL SIXTEEN CDT SECURITY OPERATIONS TEAMS ARE OFTEN DEPLOYED TO INVESTIGATE AND RESPOND TO INCIDENTS AT LOCAL LEVELS REGULARLY CAUSED BY RANSOMWARE. AS A RESULT MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS IN SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERED FROM SUCH INCIDENTS WITH THE ASSISTANCE TO HARDEN THEIR NETWORKS DID FOR THEM TO DO BETTER GOING FORWARD. ON TOP OF THAT THE SURFACE SO DATED INCIDENT RESPONSE EFFORTS. MITIGATING AND REMEDIATING SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES CAUSED FROM SOLAR WINDS OF LOG FOUR J. AND THEN WHILE DEALING WITH THE THREAT TACTICALLY AT THE STRATEGIC LEVEL. WE RELEASE THE CALIFORNIA'S FIRST FIVE YEAR CYBERSECURITY ROADMAP CAL SECURE IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR ROADMAP'S LOTS OF CLOUDS WHAT'S A PATH FORWARD FOR STATE ENTITIES AND LOCAL ENTITIES TO ACHIEVE AN INCREASE CYBERSECURITY MATURITY LEVEL. LAST YEAR IN ADDITION CDT SHIFTED ITS SECURITY OPERATIONS AND AUDIT COST FUNDING MODEL TO ALLOW STATE ENTITIES. TO REALLY RETAIN A LOT OF THEIR INTERNAL FINDINGS WERE INTERNAL INTERNAL FUNDING TO REMEDIATION EFFORTS. AS WE MADE SHIFTED DEAL WITH SUCH IMMINENT SECURITY THREATS AROUND THESE EMERGENCIES. WE MAINTAINED OUR OVERSIGHT PROGRAM ON OUR HIGH RISK AND NON HIGH RISK ENTITIES AS SUCH I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE YEAR OVER YEAR STATISTICAL IMPROVEMENTS. WHICH WE- WE DO COLLECT COMPLIANCE COMPLIANCE METRICS THROUGH AUDITS HOWEVER WE DO ALSO RELY ON OUTCOME BASED MEASURES THROUGH THESE TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS. SO TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS YEAR OVER YEAR INDICATED A DECREASE IN HIGH RISK VULNERABILITIES BY NINETEEN PERCENT. LOWER PHISHING SUSCEPTIBILITY BY 9% INTERNAL PENETRATION TESTING RESISTANCE IMPROVING BY 18% SO MEETING DEPARTMENTS ARE ARE ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES BY 18% BETTER TOWARDS MINISTRATION TESTING EXERCISES. OVERALL THESE TACTICAL ASSESSMENT SCORES ARE IMPROVING BY 5% AND AN ANNUAL INCREASE AND WE TRACK THESE METRICS AND BENCHMARKS. AS OVERALL AVERAGES AS NOTED EARLIER ON THE CURRENT AVERAGE IS FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. PRIOR PRIOR YEARS IT WAS FORTY EIGHT AND WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. OUR COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK PROGRAMS TO MAKE THE SCORE MORE DIFFICULT AND HARDER TO ATTAIN AS THE THREAT LANDSCAPE KEEPS. KEEPS EVOLVING SO OVERALL WE'VE SEEN THEIR SCORES IMPROVED BY SINGLE DIGIT NUMBERS. AREAS THAT HAVE HELPED AND REQUIRE MORE FOCUS. ON ABILITY SCANNING AND REMEDIATION PROCESSES AND PRACTICES IMPLEMENTATION OF ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURES HAVE HELPED. ALSO ADOPTION OF NEXT GENERATION ENDPOINT PROTECTION TOOLS WHICH WE'VE MIGRATED NEARLY EVERY DEPARTMENT TO THE NEXT GENERATION ENDPOINT PROTECTION DEFENSE MECHANISM. IN ADDITION DEPARTMENTS DIDN'T DO NEED MORE HELP AND SYSTEM SECURITY PLANNING DOCUMENT DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR OVERALL SECURITY PROCESSES AND PRACTICES AS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE AUDITS. ALTHOUGH THESE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS ALTHOUGH THE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE ATTACK SURFACE CONTINUES TO EXPAND WE MUST CONTINUE TO IMPROVE CYBERSECURITY OVERSIGHT TO BE SUSTAINABLE INTO THE FUTURE. NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THE FIVE SELECTED RECOMMENDATIONS. AND SET CONTEXT BUT THEY DO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL VALUES ARE OR OVERSIGHT PROGRAM CAPACITY OR INCREASE OUR CAPACITY TO PERFORM TIMELY COMPLIANCE AUDITS. AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE CD KOMMT IMPLEMENTS A FOR YOUR OVERSIGHT LIFECYCLE. THAT IS THIS DESIGNED TO ASSESS HIGH RISK DEPARTMENTS IMPACTFUL SERVICES. THIS CYCLE ENCOMPASSES COMPREHENSIVE POLICY AND PROCESS AUDITS AS WELL AS TECHNICAL WATER ABILITY ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED BY THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. AND THAT THOSE ENGAGEMENTS ARE REALLY TARGETED FOR HIGH END ON HIGH RISK ENTITIES. WHERE'S AUDITS ONLY TARGET THE HIGHEST RISK ENTITIES. HI HIGH RISK ENTITIES ARE DEFINED AND ASSIGNED BY THEIR PRIORITY. BASED ON THEIR ATTACK SURFACE BASED ON THEIR PRIOR ASSESSMENT RESULTS THEIR COMPLIANCE FILINGS- AND HOW MANY CRITICAL SYSTEMS THEY OWN AND OPERATE SO WE TAKE A REALLY MEASURE OF RISK BASED APPROACH AND FACILITATED EMPLOYMENT AUDITS ASSESSED AND ASSESSMENTS AND SELF REPORTED CAPABILITIES ON THE HIGHEST RISK ENTITIES. AND RELY ON ASSESSMENTS IMPRACTICAL TECHNICAL METRICS ON THE LOW RISK MARKETS. SO GENERALLY AS WAS MENTIONED WE PERFORM APPROXIMATELY. TEN AUDITS PER YEAR AS AN ANNUAL AVERAGE THAT DEPENDS ON RISK AND ARE OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY SESAC KNOWLEDGES CDT COMPLETED. THIRTY ONE OF THIRTY NINE AUDITS AS OF LAST YEAR. ACCORDINGLY EIGHT ENTITIES WERE ACCOMMODATED FOR SCHEDULING PURPOSES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND THE BICK PRIORITIZATION BASED ON ON THEIR MATURITY. AS OF TODAY. WE ARE TRACK TO COMPLETE FORTY EIGHT HIGH RISK AUDITS ON TOP OF THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN PLUS ASSESSMENTS THAT WE CONDUCT WITH THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. OF THESE METRICS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO OUR OVERSIGHT POSTURE INVISIBILITY INTO ALL OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT ENTITIES THAT WE HAVE- VIEW OVER. AS AN OPERATIONAL EFFORT WE FOCUSED ON BUILDING UP OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER. WE HAVE NEARLY THIRTY ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN ONBOARDED TO OUR MANAGED SECURITY OPERATIONS SERVICE BRENT HANSON TRIAL MONITORING THIS PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR ENTITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE STAFFING MARKET CAPACITY TO MONITOR THEIR OWN INTERNAL NETWORKS. AS RESPECTIVELY AUDITS PROCESS IS NOT TO TREAT ALL ENTITIES THE SAME BUT TO FOCUS ON. HIGH RISK ENTITIES RATHER THAN A SPECIFIC NUMBER. HOWEVER HIGH RISK IS A FACTOR DETERMINED AT A POINT IN TIME HAN ANNUALLY WE REALIZED RISK INVOLVED WITH THE THREAT LANDSCAPE. AND A COLLEGE THE RECOMMENDATION TO LOOK. AT THE LOOK AND EXPLORE FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO SCALE OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION EXPLORE WAYS TO BE MORE CONSULTATIVE AND ADVISORY TO HELP OUR OUR ENTITIES. THAT CANNOT SOMETIMES HELP THEMSELVES AS A SUB RECOMMENDATION TO THE NUMBER ONE. CDT SHOULD PRIORITIZE CALCULATING MATURITY METRIC SCORES FOR NINE ENTITIES THAT DID NOT HAVE PRIVACY CONTROLS AUDITED BEFORE PROCEED CONTROLS WERE ACTUALLY ADDED OVER OR BRAIDED INTO OUR AUDIT PLAN ERNEST. WE KNOWLEDGE THIS RECOMMENDATION AND WILL WILL EVALUATE THE NINE MENTIONED ENTITIES BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS C. T. SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE DENSITIES ON WHAT CONSTITUTES A CRITICAL SYSTEM AND FOLLOW UP ANNUALLY. DURING SELF ASSESSMENT PROCESS HE'S CDT WILL CLARIFY GUIDANCE ON WHAT THE CRITICAL SYSTEM DEFINITION IT IS. BY APRIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THREE- AGENCY REVIEWS AND OTHER SELF REPORTED NET MECHANISMS WILL FACTOR AND METRICS. TO COMPASS IN OUR OVERSIGHT PROCESS. NUMBER THREE UTILIZE INFORMATION FROM ENTITIES SELF ASSESSMENT SELF ASSESSMENT REPORT AS WELL AS FROM THE NATIONWIDE CYBERSECURITY REVIEW AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. TODAY WE LEVERAGE THE NCS ARE NATIONWIDE CYBERSECURITY REVIEW TO INFORM AND HELL BE SUBJECTIVE AND CSR SCORES CORRELATE TO OBJECTIVE AUDIT AND ASSESSMENT METRICS THAT WE DO HAVE ON HAND WITH THE NCS ARE WITH THIS CYBERSECURITY REVIEW PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AGGREGATED AND TRENDING REPORTS THAT WILL BE USED AS PART OF THIS RECOMMENDATION. HISTORICALLY AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE THE NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY REVIEW WAS LEVERAGED FOR GRANTS ADMISSION PURPOSES AND BY VERY NATURE HAVE BEEN VERY SUBJECTIVE. HOWEVER WE WILL CONSIDER EVALUATING AND CSR AND INCORPORATING AND CSR AS PART OF OUR RISK MAKING METHODOLOGY WITH APPROPRIATE WAITING. IN LINE TO WORK TOWARDS OUR SECURITY MATURITY METHODOLOGY. NUMBER FOUR CDT SHOULD COMPLETE THE NECESSARY UPDATES THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL IN OUR STATEWIDE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT MANUAL THE REFERENCE LATEST REVISION OF THE FEDERAL MISSED SPECIAL PUBLICATION EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE. WELL CITY HAS GENERALLY ADOPTED THIS SPECIAL PUBLICATION EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE. AS A MINIMUM STANDARD FOR STATE ENTITIES INVESTORS WERE RELEASED REVISION FIVE TO THE STANDARD PUBLICATION DURING THE PANDEMIC IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. ALTHOUGH THE PANDEMIC ALL ALL ALL THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE BEEN CONTINUALLY UPDATING SPECIFIC PREFERENCES AND HIGHLIGHT APPLICABLE CONTROLS THE PARTICULAR UPDATES ARE MADE TO ADDRESS IMMINENT IMMEDIATE THREATS OF GAPS WE ARE FACED WITH ON AN IMMEDIATE BASIS TO NOTE WE HAD RELEASED FOR IMPORTANT PRIVACY AND SECURITY STANDARDS JUST PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. WILDER VISION FOR WAS WASN'T DROUGHT THAT THE NATIONAL LEVEL OUR STANDARDS HOW OUR FOURTH STANDARDS WERE IMPLEMENTED THE COVER EMAIL THREAT PROTECTION EMAIL PROTECTION PRACTICES ENDPOINT PROTECTION PRIVACY THRESHOLD AND PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES AS WELL AS MINIMUM SECURITY STANDARDS. FOR STATE DEFINED PARAMETERS. DURING THE PANDEMIC CDT WAS ABLE TO PUBLISH SIX MORE STANDARDS WHICH ADVANCE THE STATE WIDE INFORMATION SECURITY PRO PROGRAM. AND THEY'LL STILL DO COVER ABOUT SECURITY PRACTICES VISHING EXERCISE STANDARDS VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT SECURITY EVENT NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSE PROTOCOLS. UPDATES TO THE RELEASE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH AS WELL AS OUR CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY MATURITY METRIC FRAMEWORK. WHICH ON AN ONGOING BASIS CONTINUALLY EVOLVES AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. CTA KNOWLEDGES THIS RECOMMENDATION AND HAS BEGUN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING FROM REVISION FOR DIVISION. FIVE TO BE COMPLETED BY FISCAL YEAR END CLARIFY REMOTE ACCESS GUIDANCE BY FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO PERTAINING TO EMPLOYEES USING PERSONAL DEVICES. CDT IS ISSUING REFERENCE UPDATES TO THE REMOTE REMOTE ACCESS INTERNAL WORK STANDARDS PERTAINING TO PERSONAL DEVICE GUIDANCE. THIS WAS INFORMAL GUIDANCE WITH RELEASED DURING THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THAT'S PART OF THE RECOMMENDATION WE WILL EMBED THIS IS OUR OFFICIAL TELEWORK ACTIVE STANDARD GOING FORWARD. WE AGREE THAT TELEWORK SECURITY WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND BE AT GREATER RISK GOING FORWARD AND WILL BE COMMITTED TO INVOLVING OUR PRACTICES AND STANDARDS AROUND REMOTE WORKFORCE OF OUR OF OUR- DEPARTMENTS. I DO APPRECIATE CSA'S VALUABLE AND PUT THEM INTO COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER EVOLVING IT. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NEARING AN ENDEMIC WE ARE STILL A CYBER EPIDEMIC WE CAN TRULY SAY WE FACILITATED. THE CORRECT COURSE OF ACTION AND AS A RESULT KEPT ENTITIES OUT OF HOT WATER DURING THESE EMERGENCIES. HOWEVER THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE INCREASED COLLABORATION BETWEEN ALL OF OUR OFFICES AND GETTING. AND EVOLVING OUR STATE. AND NUMBER THIRTY JOURNEY. AND NOW I WILL TURN IT BACK OVER TO RUSS. I THANK THE POWERS YOU CAN SEE CYBERSECURITY IS VERY DETAIL AND LOTS OF INFORMATION HERE ARE THE REGION PUBLISHED THE SOUTH HOW SECURE- PLAN THIS ARTICULATE A ROAD MAP TO GUIDE STATE ENTITIES. AS THEY WON'T START RISKY ACTIVITIES AND RAISE THAT BAR ACROSS THE STATE AGAIN THAT THE AUDIT PLAN OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE RUN BECAUSE SHE'S ABOUT OVERALL PLAN BUT IT IS NOT. ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE PARK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT DURING THE COURSE OF THE PAIN THAT WE CAN DECISIVE AND IMMEDIATE ACTION TO DEAL WITH THE TELEWORK AND THE OTHER CYBERSECURITY. OUR RESEARCH THE B<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; SPOKE WITH THAT&lt;/c&gt;</u> I THINK THE COMMITTEE AND IN FACT CSAA FOR CONTINUED ATTENTION ON CYBER SECURITY IT IS IMPERATIVE. WE GET THIS RIGHT ADDRESS WE THAT WE ARE TO TAKE A QUESTION THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR MUCH AND I THE ASSEMBLY SALAS. DO YOU HAVE SOME. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM- WILL TO START WITH THE FIRST THREE QUESTION THAT ASKED. ARE AND YOU- ALLUDED SOME OF THE ANSWER. BUT THE REASON WHY OF THE HUNDRED AND EIGHT REPORTING ENTITIES ARE THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN ONES IS HIGH RISK AND LOW RISK BUT- WHY TO PHRASE THIS LESS THAN HALF OF IT WAS DONE AND WITH THE AUDITOR AND ESTABLISHED YOU'RE TOLD THAT. YOU KNOW WAS IT BECAUSE OF IT OR DID THEY GIVE YOU A REASON WASN'T STAFFING WAS OF THE PANDEMIC WAS IT WHY WHY WEREN'T THESE DONE- TO THE EXPECTATIONS WERE WERE WE'VE GOT MORE OF A WOULD BE COMPLETED CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME A- DIRECT ANSWER ON THAT HIGH RISK ENTITIES. TO ACHIEVE FORTY EIGHT OF THE- FIFTY TWO THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. SO THEY'RE CORRECT IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM WE ACCOMPLISH THIRTY ONE. OF THE THIRTY NINE THAT WERE SCHEDULED- BUT SOME OF THOSE THAT WEREN'T COMPLETED BY THE END OF YOUR THREE WERE ACTUALLY WHITE SO. SO WE ARE ON PACE. TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH ALMOST ALL OF THE ENTITIES ARE. THE FOR YOUR COMPOST ARE ACTUALLY ESSENTIALLY PUSHING BACK AND SAYING THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARTICLES SO WE'RE IN OUR VIEW WE ARE ACTUALLY NOT BEHIND A HIGH RISK AUDITS. AGAIN THE REST OF THE HUNDRED KNIGHT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AN AUDIT SO THAT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED PRESSBOX. WONDERWORKER PARKS. AND CURRENT STRUCK OKAY WITHIN FORTY FORTY EIGHT THE FIFTY TWO THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AS HIGH RISK WILL BE COMPLETED. YES GOT IT ALL RIGHT AND THEN LET ME JUST ASK- ALSO YOU KNOW THE AUDITOR AND SUGGESTED THAT CD T. USE THE RESULTS OF THE FEDERAL NATIONWIDE CYBER SECURITY REVIEW TO INFORM THE STATUS OF THE STATE'S INFORMATION SECURITY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT CTE IS ALREADY REQUIRING REPORTING AGENCIES TO COMPLETE THE NATIONAL REVIEW EVERY YEAR. RIGHT I BELIEVE IT'S CONDITION FOR RECEIVING SOME- GRANT FUNDING FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. AS THE QUESTION IS- WHY DOESN'T CD T. USE THAT INFORMATION TO COULD GAIN A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE STATUS OF THE END. OF THE STATE'S INFORMATION SECURITY. IN THE PAST WE DID NOT INCORPORATE THAT RECORD BECAUSE IT WAS SELF REPORTED INFORMATION. BYE WEEK KNOWLEDGE THE RECOMMENDATION WE THINK IT IS A GOOD INDICATION- WHICH IS MUCH BETTER THAN NOTHING AND PLAN TO INCORPORATE THAT IN THE FUTURE BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN PART OF THE SECURITY POLICY THE CYBER SECURITY POLICY OF THE STATE. UP UNTIL THIS POINT. ALLEN RIGHT NOW I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK- WE CAN INTEGRATED IN THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY IF THAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE SO WHETHER IT'S UNDER THE- ST FIFTY THREE HUNDRED OR THE SAM- GUIDELINES I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL JUST GIVE AN OVERALL PICTURE. OF WHERE WE'RE AT. AT THE STATE IN TERMS OF SECURITY- I DO WANT TO. ASK ANOTHER QUESTION IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR- YOU KNOW MISTER NICHOLS I BELIEVE YOU STATED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN AN INCREASE IN ATTACKS INCLUDING PHISHING AND RANSOMWARE- IN THE PAST YEAR- DCA A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ENTITIES UNDER ATTACK. AND THE RECENT- SECURITY STATUS MAY BE WITH THE AUDITS- AND- ALREADY HAVE THEM. DO ANY OF THEM LOCKED THE POLICIES UNDER THE STATE AUDITOR'S REVIEW. LET ME DEFER TO MISTER PENICHE TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS THAT I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS AND- THANK YOU. SIX CERTAINLY HAS MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS THERE IS GENERALLY AN INCREASE IN SOME OF THESE INCIDENTS. WHICH IS WHY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE'VE BUILT UP. IT'S A SOPHISTICATED INCIDENT RESPONSE CAPABILITY THE NEW THE SUPPORT OF CAL SICK AND THAT'S REALLY INTENDED TO. MITIGATE MITIGATE SOME OF THE NEGATIVE OR ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT POTENTIALLY CAN STEM STEM FROM A PHISHING ATTACK WERE RANSOMWARE ATTACK SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OR A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO CONTAIN THE ACTUAL THREAT BEFORE IT CAUSES HARM FULL DAMAGE. SO WE'VE- INSTITUTED THIS INCIDENT RESPONSE AND THREAT INTELLIGENCE PRACTICE ALL FOR THE PURPOSES OF MITIGATING. THE GAPS OR ISSUES THAT MAY BE. NOT THAT MAY BE EVIDENT WITHIN AT THE DEPARTMENTS SO THAT THERE IS THE POTENTIALLY CORRELATING POINT THERE WHICH IS WHY WE USE THAT TO INFORM WHAT WE DO. WITH OUR SECURITY COMMUNITY TO ESTABLISH NEXT GENERATION INCIDENT RESPONSE CAPABILITIES ESTABLISH. A THREAT INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES THAT THAT THAT'S USEDTO INFORM OUR STATEWIDE SECURITY OPERATIONS PRACTICES AS AN OVERARCHING MITIGATE- WHILE THE DEPARTMENT OF AT A LOCAL LEVEL THIS IS ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY- REMEDIATE THE ISSUE REMEDIATE AN ISSUE BY FOR EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTING BETTER ACCESS CONTROLS IMPLEMENTING. BETTER IN POINT PRODUCTION STANDARDS IMPLEMENTING BETTER SECURITY AWARENESS PRACTICES ASK GUIDE GUIDED BY BY OUR OFFICE TO POLICY MEASURES SO THERE'S A CORRELATING POINT THERE THAT WERE LEADING POINT. AIMS TO INFORM WHAT WE DO AS A STATE STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY COMMUNITY WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS. IN THE VAN THAT THE CAL SICK. SOME MUCH SO TWENTY THREE IF I CAN ASK OUR ONE AT A STRIP YOUR CALL. AS WE GO THROUGH OUR AUDITS DO NOT PUBLISH PUBLIC SPUR SCORES WERE FOR DOCTOR. IN THIS S. R. C. S. AUDIT ALSO THAT THEY ARE AND A ENERGY P. WITH INTENT NOT. EXPRESS MAKING TARGETS MANY OF OUR OLDER WILL VERY CAREFUL. WITH THAT. WE DO PROVIDE THE SPECIFICS BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH THEM TO HELP EDUCATE THEM ON THE THINGS THAT WE DO. ARE YEAH NINE UNDERSTAND THAT WOULD ONE. PUBLIC LIST SOME THAT WE DON'T PUT THE AT FURTHER RISK BUT I DO WANT TO. I DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER HAVE THE POWER. IN PLACE OR WHETHER IT'S A NEXT GENERATION INCIDENT RESPONSE OUR THREAT INTELLIGENCE THAT WERE USING THE BEST PRACTICES FOR THOSE ENTITIES. THAT'S IMPROVE THEIR SECURITY SO WHETHER YOU KNOW IT'S AND IT WHETHER TDD WHICH I MENTIONED EARLIER ANYBODY ELSE. IS THAT TECHNOLOGY BEING. UTILIZED AND IS CD T. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR IMPLEMENTING THE STATE'S SECURITY LIKE HOW ARE WE GETTING THAT OUT TO ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND I KNOW WERE FALLING BACK ON SOME OF THE ARTISTS BUT NOW YOU'RE ON PACE BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE STILL PROTECTING YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S PRIVACY IN THEIR SECURITY THAT THESE. MEASURES ARE ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT MAKES SENSE. SO I'LL LET ME BACK UP HOW OFFICE. WE DO COURTNEY BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR PARK. TO CAN SECURITY POLICIES AND THE TOOLS AND PRACTICES. THAT ARE IN PLACE. AND SO. SINCE YOU MENTIONED EATING DE UM ALL USE THAT EXAMPLE. AS THE. EXPERIENCED ACROSS EVENT THAT THAT THEY HAVE WE WORK WITH SOME OF OUR PARTNERS AND BROUGHT IN TECHNOLOGY TO HELP WITH IDENTITY. MATCHING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE THE APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE TO THE EXTENT THAT FRAUD COULD BE PERPETRATED. BY BAD ACTORS AND IN THIS SOCIETY SO WHILE SOME OF THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY A POLICY CHANGE WERE ABSOLUTELY USING THOSE SPEEDS FROM. OUR OWN. FROM OUR CYBER SECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER FROM THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND FROM OUR PARTNERS TO IMPROVE THAT PLATFORM CONTINUE. IT AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT IF I MAY ANSWER A WEEK WEEK WE DO COLLECT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS A LOT OF ACTION A MILESTONE KIND OF A RISK REGISTER INVESTMENT AND ASSOCIATED PLAN FROM EACH DEPARTMENT. AND WE ULTIMATELY AGGREGATE THAT DATA POINT AND A BUNCH OF OTHER DATA POINTS COLLECTED FROM AUDITS AND ASSESSMENTS. AND GO OVER A LOT OF THESE DETAILS AND CORRELATOR COROLLARY CAUSE AND EFFECT POINTS. AT THE AGENCY LEVEL TO REALLY ENABLE OUR OUR OUR AGENCIES TO HELP PUSH DOWN FROM THE TOP DOWN EFFECTIVE AND BETTER. BETTER CHANGE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND THEN WE DO THAT ENOUGH OBVIOUSLY IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER MATTER PARTICULARLY. AROUND THE SPECIFIC HOLD BUILDINGS OF SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS THAT APPLIED TO THOSE ENTITIES. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU I AM DID HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION IF I MAY JUST HAVE UNDERSTAND- THE METRICS THE TO USE YOUR MATURITY METRICS. RIGHT AND I'M UNDERSTAND IT'S LIKE ON A SCALE OF ZERO TO FOUR CIVIC KIND OF EXPLAIN. DESERVE A MISSING ISRAEL'S WORSENED FOR IS EXCEPTIONAL- BUT KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WE ONLY HAD SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN BUT ACTUALLY THAT YOU ACTUALLY DEVELOP METRICS FOR IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT AND IT THAT A CERTAIN POINT POINT IN TIME LAST YEAR AS WAS MENTIONED TRACK TO COLLECT THIRTY NINE METRICS AND BY THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR FOR FORTY EIGHT. METRICS AS A RESULT FROM BOTH AUDITS AND ASSESSMENTS. AND JUST TO REITERATE KIND OF THE SCALE OF THESE METRICS OF IT SCALES FROM ZERO TO A FOR. ZERO IT MEANS YOU'RE DOING NOTHING IN A PARTICULAR SECURITY CONTROL CATEGORY A ONE MEANS YOU HAVE EIGHT. A POLICY A TWO MEANS YOU HAVEN'T AND ASSOCIATED PROCESSING PROCEDURE. IN A THREE AND A FOUR GENERALLY IS THE OUTCOME BASED MEASURE OR SUCCESS MEASURE HOW EFFECTIVE YOU ARE WITHIN A SECURITY CONTROL CATEGORY. OFTENTIMES THE ISSUE IS THAT AN ENTITY OR DEPARTMENT MAY NOT BE MATURE AND HAVING A POLICY STANDARD PROCEDURE. BUT MAY PERFORM WELL IN A SECURITY CONTROL CATEGORY WITHOUT A POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SO GENERALLY BY THE VERY NATURE METRICS. WOULD BE SCORED LOWER. THAT THAN WHAT THEY'RE IS POSTURE. WHAT WOULD REALLY BE IN REALITY SO WE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED THAT THE ELECTRIC METHODOLOGY TO ENCOURAGE AND THE PUSH DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THEY ALSO FOCUS ON POLICIES STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES WHICH ULTIMATELY LEADS LEAD TO YOUR OVERALL LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF YOUR SECURITY. POSTURE IN YOUR SECURITY PROGRAM- HELLO HOWEVER WE DO ENCOURAGE DEPARTMENTS ALSO BE TACTICAL AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE- MEET ME TO GET AT THE END OF THE ROAD BASED UPON THE- SO IT'S A BALANCE AND THAT THAT IS WHY WE OFTEN KIND UNDER RAVEL THE METHODOLOGY AND LOOK AT. LOOK AT ASSESSMENT SCORES INDEPENDENTLY AS WE ALSO RELY ON BOSNIA SIX SECURITY MATURITY SCORES WHICH ENCOMPASSED THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES SO BUT BOTH. BOTH FRONTS ARE NEEDED OR BOTH EFFORTS ARE NEEDED SO WE GENERALLY DE COUPLE THE COUPLE ARE BENCHMARKS. IT'S A REALLY DEAL WITH THE IMMINENT THREAT SECONDHAND. PRODUCT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLOITATION BUT SOME FOR THE SEVENTEEN REPORTING ENTITIES. THAT RECEIVE SCORES BOB IGER FOUND THAT THEY ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE SCORE OF ONE POINT THREE. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S AN- FIGURE EIGHT ON PAGE TWENTY TWO OF THE REPORT. SOME- SOME SHOW LITTLE OR NO PROGRESS FOR SOME ENTITIES. AND FIRST OF OTHER ENTITIES ARE SCORES OF ACTUALLY DECLINED. SO WHAT CD HE'S PERSPECTIVE ON THIS AND YOU KNOW. SEDG SAYING LOOK WE SHOULD TRY TO HAVE A MINIMUM SCORE OF AT LEAST A THREE ON THESE METRICS. AND WHAT IS CDT DOING TO HELP IMPROVE- THOSE ENTITIES THAT. OVERALL METRICS COURSE. YES SORRY OUR GOAL IS ALWAYS TO CONTINUALLY RAISE THE BAR- DEFINITELY WE NEED TO RAISE THE BAR AND BE AT A MINIMUM OF A TO OUR BLOG MEETING YOU HAVE A HEALTHY POLICY PROCESS AND PROCEDURE IN PLACE HOWEVER THIS YEAR. MATURITY METRICS DON'T DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- IT DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW EFFECTIVE YOU ARE HOW IT AFFECTED YOUR DOING AS IT PERTAINS TO YOUR SUSSMAN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A POLICY IN MIND SO WITHOUT WEEK WE ARE CONTINUALLY RELEASING TEMPLATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT DEPARTMENTS COULD IT TAKE TAKE A DOLPHIN CHARLIE ON THEIR OWN TO DATE WITH PUBLISHED BETWEEN SIXTY SIXTY TO SEVENTY TEMPLATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THAT DEPARTMENTS COULD TAKE RIGHT AWAY AND THEN IMPLEMENT AND PUT FORTH INTO PRACTICE WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION SO THAT THAT'S ONE MEASURE. I MEASURE IS- FOCUSING ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENTAL FOCUSED WORKSHOPS EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS. VULSO IT ENABLED WERE BUILT OUR INFORMATION SECURITY LEADERSHIP ACADEMY SO THAT WE CAN EDUCATED PARDON FOR MISSION SECURITY OFFICERS TO EFFECTUATE. THESE POLICIES THESE. POLICY AND PROCEDURAL CHANGES FROM WITHIN. SO JUST WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE FOR US TO HELP THESE ENTITIES IMPROVE THEIR SCORES TO AT LEAST IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU SAID A MINIMUM OF THE TWO- I MEAN IS IT REALLY JUST IMPLEMENTING THESE POLICIES IS GOING TO TAKE. MORE BUDDY YOU TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BUT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GET THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S LOW OF THE SERVING ONE SOME HAVE SHOWN NO MOVEMENT AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. SOME OF THE CLIENT- I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AT HOW DO WE- FIX THIS. STILL THE PLAN IT'S REALLY TO ALIGN ENTITIES AND SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR JOURNEY. OF IMPLEMENTING WHAT'S OUTLINED AND CAL SECURE. CAL SECURE WHICH OUTLINES. BROUGHT PROCESS. RIGHT PROCESS- TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP IN AND ON. AND I WORKFORCE ROAD MATH SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORTER DEPARTMENTS AND BUILDING UP THEIR SECURITY DEFENSES AUDIENCE CAPABILITIES AS IT AS IT IS MAPPED TO CAL SECURE. SO MR SAUCE ON ME MAYBE. A LITTLE WORK ON A TRUCK WITH PRIOR TO. CAL SECURE PLAN LAST FALL DEPARTMENTS REALLY OPERATE WITHIN THOSE POLICIES ARE WITHOUT. OVER GUIDANCE FROM FROM DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY NEED NOT GIVING THEM A ROAD MAP THE CONNECTED WHERE THEY ARE TO WHERE WE WANT THEM TO BE. THAT IS THE INTENT OF THAT CAL SECURE. TO ESSENTIALLY LAID OUT AS A SERIES OF OBJECTIVES WE'RE GOING. TO COMPLETE. ENGINE THE FUNDING BACK THAT MR AND- MENTIONED DURING HIS COMMENTS. GIVES THEM THE FUN INTO. TO ME MOVEMENT ALONG THOSE ROADS THAT WHERE WE KNOW. IF IS A GAP THERE YEAR TO TWO YEARS TO SEE WHERE THEY ARE IN THE ARE THAT MAKE. CDT IS- YEAH IN THAT BUSINESS UP IMPLEMENTING THERE'S PROCEDURES POLICIES THEM TO FRANKLY THAT'S WHY DOES ORDER HAVE. AND SECURITY WITH THE EACH. IS TO BE PERFECTLY ALIGNED THERE MODEL. SO WE WERE PROVIDED THEM NOW WITH THE ROAD MAP AND ALL. AND HELPING TO GUIDE THEM DOWN THAT DIRECTORS AGENTS STAFF INFORMATION SIX STAFF AT BOTH LEVELS THE WOMAN'S. THAT REALLY START WHICH THE A BIG PIECE OF THIS IS IN UPGRADING ESSENTIALLY CULTURE OR PROCESS. DEBTS SECURITY GOT TO BE A FUN PART OF ANY PROGRAM THAT. SHOULD END IN THE REAL. HOUSE IS NOT SPECIAL AN HOUR. THAT WE BRING IN WE ARE CHANGE THAT MESSAGING WERE CHANGING THAT CULTURE- AND I BELIEVE WE ARE MAKING PROCESS. OUR PROGRESS AGAINST THAT BECAUSE YOU SEE THE METRICS- WE'RE STAYING YOU KNOW RELATIVELY STAGNANT AND WITH THAT OBSERVATION. WE ARE RAISING THE BAR WE'RE WE'RE ACHIEVING SIMILAR SCORES BUT THOSE SCORES ARE AGAINST MORE MORE RIGOROUS METRICS AS WE GO. SO WE ARE IMPROVING. THE SECURITY. A PROFILE WHICH IS NOW WORK WANT TO BE. IN A WOULD ALSO. POINT OUT OR- IN THINGS LIKE THE MILL IS WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT A SCORE CALL. IF ANY SAYS ACTUALLY TO AND- TWO ON. IT IS ALMOST ON YOU SO IT'S QUITE OFTEN. BETWEEN INFORMATIONS. AND THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DEPLOY WHETHER IT'S ASSISTANCE INSIDE AN APARTMENT OR PUBLIC FACING. IT'S GOT TO BE USABLE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS OR FOR OUR RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA TO. OBTAIN SERVICES FROM SPECTRUM WITH ONE. ARM UP PERFECTLY SECURE SYSTEM WOULD BE ONE IT'S SO UNUSABLE NOBODY WHATEVER. TO THAT TO EXPERIENCE. YEAH NINE. A PRE THAT THE- ANSWER BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I TALK TO YOU LIKE MY CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME THE- THE FUNDAMENTAL. QUESTION THEY ALWAYS ASK ME IS YOU KNOW I DO MY BANKING SECURELY AND WHY CAN I DO ALL THESE OTHER SERVICES SECURELY I CAN USE AN ATM I CAN GO ONLINE I CAN USE MY PHONE. AND IT'S THROUGH SECURE SYSTEM SO THE- SECURITY VERSUS ABILITY TO- ACTUALLY USE A SYSTEM A YOU KNOW. FOR FOLKS BACK HOME IS JUST A VERY SIMPLE THING IF I COULD DO IT FOR MY BANKING WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH ALL THESE OTHER ENTITIES. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW CAL SECURE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR SO ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD JUST. YOU KNOW HEALTH CARE THE WAY TO GO AND- THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA INCREASE- THE METRICS WHETHER IT'S- THE NATIONAL OR WHETHER IT'S THE ZERO FOUR- GET UP. CASCAR IS A WAY TO DO THAT. CALCULAR IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY. BUT IT DOES PROVIDE THE ROAD MAP THAT THAT NOW PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO THE DEPARTMENTS THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE THAT SCORE- IN FACT IT IS ACTUALLY BEEN REFERENCED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE NUMBER OF FORMS AS BEING A STANDOUT AMONG STATES. IN ACTUALLY PROVIDING THAT TYPE OF THE ROAD MAP OF THE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VENTURE. HI I HAVE A THANK YOU MISTER SALAS SO I JUST NEED TO. SOME CLARITY I. HOW MANY AUDIT. ARE GOING TO BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY TWENTY TO THE AUDITOR. NOTES THAT YOU NEED TO COMPLETE SEVENTEEN- TO MEET THE FORTY EIGHT AUDITS IN YOUR LETTER. BUT THE CD T. HAS ONLY AVERAGED ELEVEN SO ARE YOU GOING TO BE HIRING ADDITIONAL PEOPLE I GUESS I'D I'D- I DON'T KNOW THE CLEAR ANSWER TO THAT. I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER TO THAT. IT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT MONEY-BECAUSE OF THE REFERENCE SO WE'RE THREE YEARS. THREE YEARS COMPLETED IN THAT AUDIT CYCLE FOR YEARS. AT THE END OF THE THIRD YEAR WE COMPLETED THIRTY ONE. IT'S THERE WERE OTHER AUDITS THAT WERE IN PROCESS BUT NOT COMPLETED SO IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE TO START SEVENTEENTH START AND FINISH SEVENTEEN AUDITS IN THIS LAST YEAR. WE HAVE TO COMPLETE THOSE SEVENTEEN SO A NUMBER OF THEM WERE VERY CLOSE TO FINISHING IN THE FIRST PLACE. BY THE END OF THE FOUR YEAR CYCLE WE ARE ON TASK TO COMPLETE FORTY EIGHT OF THE FIFTY TWO AUDITS THAT WOULD BE ON THE HIGH RISK ENTITIES STATE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT SO YES SO BASICALLY RIGHT NOW TO DO THAT WORK YOU DON'T SEE THAT YOU NEED TO. ASSIGN MORE STAFF OR CONTRACT OUT YOU HAVE THE PERSONNEL YOU NEED. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. OF- SINCE MANY OF THE A METRIC- CATEGORIES ARE SUPPLIED BY. NEED TO SINCE MANY OF THE METRIC CATEGORIES ARE SUPPLID BY AUTO PERFORMANCE HOW DO YOU CALCULATE A METRIC A MATURITY METRIC FOR LOW RISK ENTITIES THAT- DON'T RECEIVE AN AUDIT. KELLY WON'T DRESS UP YEAH NOT SOMETHING WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS ON THE HUB PLANNING IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR PLAN WILL BE TO SHORE UP THE METRICS. SO CURRENTLY WE WOULD RELY ON SELF SELF ASSESSMENT SUBJECTIVE QUESTIONNAIRES AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT THAT'S HOW WE WOULD WOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT THOSE METRICS. WE ARE EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES AND CONDUCTING FISCAL ANALYSIS UP ON HOW TO. MORE OBJECTIVELY- COVER THOSE OTHER ENTITIES WITHOUT RESORTING TO SUBJECTIVE MEASURES LIKE QUESTIONNAIRES AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING AS A PLAN OF ACTION GOING FORWARD. OKAY CITIES LETTER NOTES THAT THE METRIC DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- THE SOCCER CAL SICK- SERVICES- WHY IF THAT'S THE CASE THE CDT FEEL THAT THESE SERVICES MAY MEDIC- MEDICAID A LESS MATURE AND EIGHTY. SO WE WERE BUILDING THE STATEWIDE SECURITY CONTROLS AS A COMPENSATING CONTROL FOR ENTITIES. REMEMBER WHICH CANNOT IMPLEMENT SECURITY CONTROLS LOCALLY FOR EXAMPLE. CONDUCTING INCIDENT RESPONSE PROCESSES LOCALLY SOMETHING THAT THAT SOME OF OUR ENTITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ABOUT EXCELLED IN AND THAT WAS THE MAIN DRIVER MOTIVATOR AND ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM SO THAT WE CAN DO THAT FOR THEM HOWEVER THE METRICS SOLELY MEASURE DEPARTMENTS. SCORES AND ABILITY AND MATURITY TO DEAL ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT STATEWIDE CENTRALIZED SERVICES. OKAY SO- I SHOULD SELL THE SELL THESE ENTITIES PARTICIPATION WITH THE SOCCER CAL SICK IMPROVE THEIR MATURITY. YES IT WILL IMPROVE THEIR MATURITY AND THEIR ABILITY TO BE RESILIENT TO THE THREATS RATS AND HANDS. OKAY AND THEN LEVEL THREE I'M SORRY DON'T DON'T SORRY WE DON'T MEASURE THAT IS PART OF THE CURRENT RISK MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY THAT'S AN INDEPENDENT COMPENSATING CONTROL THAT THAT HELPS DEPARTMENTS. WITH THEIR LACK OF FULFILLING A SECURITY CONTROL CATEGORY. SO SHORT. MYSTERY AND IT TO YOUR POINT FRANKLY THERE'S A GAP IN PART OF THE SCORING METHODOLOGY WHEN I ESPECIALLY A SMALL ORGANIZATION. HOW IT WORKS WITH OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER TO ACQUIRE SOME OF THOSE SECURITIES SERVICES ACTUALLY CAL IN THEIR SECURITY SCORE BECAUSE THE WAY THE SECURITY SCORE IS CALCULATED IS BASED ON WHAT THEY DO. AND HENCE FOR SCORING METHODOLOGY ACTUALLY DOES NEED TO BE UPDATED TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. RIGHT SO JST. TO CLARIFY IT ARE HAVE YOU DO YOU HAVE MATURITY METRICS FOR ANY LOW RISK ENTITIES. FOR NON HIGH RISK ENTITIES NO WE DO NOT. WE WILL RELY ON THE ASSESSMENT SCORES. OUR RATE- SO- LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE. SO I DO I DO I DO WANT TO SAY WITH- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A BRIEFING OF THE LEGISLATURE I'VE APPRECIATED THE VOLUNTARY COOPERATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND BRIEFING ME AND SOME OF MY FORMER COLLEAGUES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. BUT OF MORE FORMAL MECHANISM IS A INTERESTING RECOMMENDATION BY THE AUDITOR AS CYBER SECURITY MAY BE TOO IMPORTANT OF AN ISSUE TO LEAVE TO IT INFORMAL REPORTING IS THERE ANY INTEREST BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO BUILD UPON OUR CURRENT BRIEFING- FORMAT. WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE INTERESTED IN HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT. I CAN'T COMMIT TO THAT I HAVE NOT HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH GOVERNMENT'S OFFICE PROJECT WILL PUSH WHAT'S- OKAY. RIGHT I THINK THAT WE ARE- DONE WITH. THE QUESTIONS I REALLY APPRECIATE- YOUR TIME AND OF. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE QUESTIONS WHILE WE ARE DISCUSSING THE AUDITORS- RECOMMENDATIONS BUT- WE WILL MOVE ON TO THAT. FOR THE AUTO PAY SO IF WE COULD HAVE YOU COME BACK UP. ALL RIGHTS OF THE AUDITOR HAS MADE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS- TO THE LEGISLATURE AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I'VE INTRODUCED TWO BILLS TO USES VEHICLES FOR. LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SO I WANTED TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS ESPECIALLY RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT NON REPORTING ENTITIES WHO. HAVEN'T GOTTEN AS MUCH OF FOCUS TODAY. SO- FIRST TO US YES THEY RECOMMEND FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUIRE CDTV TO REPORT CONFIDENTIALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE IS- TO THE LEGISLATURE AND CSR SCORES IMMATURITY METRIC SCORES AS YOU CONSIDERED THESE MORE DETAILED- INFORMATION THAT STATISTICAL INFORMATION ABOUT AYE ESSAYS AND THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY RECEIVES SO FIRST IS HOW DO THESE TWO SCORES- WHICH PROVIDE NO INSIGHT TO WEAKNESS OR STRENGTH JUST OVERALL MATURITY. HOW ARE THEY MORE HELPFUL. SO I THINK IT GIVES- THEY WERE DESIGNED TAKE QUICKLY SEE WHERE AN ENTITY- IS AS FAR AS THEIR MATURITY- ARE THEY PROGRESSING AND ARE THEY MEETING THOUGH SENT MINIMUM STANDARDS SO I THINK- JUST LIKE WE DISPLAY IN THE REPORT THAT ON AVERAGE THE MATURITY METRIC SCORES WERE ONE POINT THREE WHERE THEY SHOULD BE AT LEAST A TWO AMP I'M POTENTIALLY HIGHER I THINK THOSE SUMMARY STATISTICS AND- IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SPECIFIC DEPARTMENT THAT'S A EASY NUMBER THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT AND CAN GET A SENSE FOR. HOW ARE WE DOING AS A STATE HOUSING DEPARTMENT DOING AND- DEFINITELY FURTHER DISCUSSIONS COULD BE HELPFUL- BACK AND FORTH QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S OF A ONE POINT EASY NUMBER THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT THE TRACK OVER TIME AND COMPARE ENTITIES TO EACH OTHER. AND WHAT ABOUT- GETTING THE FULL I. SA- TO GET THE WHOLE OF THE WHOLE STORY. SO I THINK THE I A SAFE THAT SINGLE SCORE IS HELPFUL FOR COMPARING THAT THE FULL I. SA WOULD DEFINITELY PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION- THAT IF YOU GOT ALL OF THE ISAY'S WE LOOKED AT SCORES FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU FOUND HELPFUL. YEAH I THINK IT PROVIDES A LOT OF DETAILED INFORMATION. AND THEN THE CSA'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NOT REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE LAST A PUBLISHED REPORT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHY- YOU HAVE SWITCHED OVER TO REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATIVE. LEADERSHIP AS OPPOSED TO REPORTING TO- POLICY COMMITTEES WITH THE JURISDICTION. YEAH SO WE HAD IT ADICIONAL DISCUSSIONS- A SWEEP I KNOW ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH NON REPORTING ENTITIES ARE INDEPENDENCE IS THEIR INDEPENDENCE- SO WE FIVE. THAT REPORTING AT A HIGHER LEVEL AND DEFINITELY THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP COULD REFERRED THAT DIRECTLY TO A POLICY COMMITTEE- BUT WHEN WE THOUGHT THAT THAT MIGHT- REPORTING A HIGHER LEVEL MADE. WOULD MAYBE BE MORE ACCEPTABLE TURN ON REPORTING ENTITIES AND THEN IF THE LEGISLATURE THINKS IT'S MOST APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A COMMITTEE LIKE THIS LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION THEN THAT'D BE DEFINITELY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY. YOU'RE JUST TRYING SOMETHING ELSE FIRST THEY DIDN'T LIKE CDT AND THEN THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE POLICY COMMITTEE SAYS THIS IS THE THIRD THE THIRD TRY IS THAT IT'S- WE NEVER RECOMMENDED DIRECTLY TO CDT WE WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE UNDER WAS THAT SHIFT FROM A SPECIFIC COMMITTEE. AND IT ANOTHER CONCERN WITH THE COMMITTEE WAS LAST TIME WE- RECOMMEND IT- PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE AND I DON'T BELIEVE AT THAT TIME THERE IS A QUICKLY SENATE. COMMITTEE SO THEN THERE IS THE CONCERN OF OUR WE ONLY GIVING INFORMATION TO THE ASSEMBLY SO- TECH DRESS THAT ALSO GOING AT A HIGHER LEVEL AND THEN THEY CAN DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES TO DIG INTO THE INFORMATION I KNOW YOU NEVER RECOMMENDED CD T. BUT IT WAS ON IN ONE OF THE EARLIER BILLS THERE SO YEAH. YES OKAY WELL THAT THAT'S A- MAY SENSE- CSA'S RECOMMEND FOR NOT REPORTING ENTITIES- CONTINUES TO HAVE A THREE YEAR CYCLE FOR ISA'S EVEN THOUGH BOTH ARE LOW RISK AND HIGH RISK REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE A TWO YEAR CYCLE UNDER CD T. WIDE VARIANCE. SO DID THREE YEARS WAS. WAS INTENDED TO BE A LITTLE MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN THAN THE I SAY BECAUSE I SAY IS HIGHLY TECHNICAL POINT TIME AND WE- WE ENVISION THIS BEING A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ALSO LOOK AT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND BASED ON. A REPORT IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE LOOKED AT- THE INCREMENTAL OF. THE PEOPLE OF THE NUMBER FOR ENTITIES THAT WERE DOING THEM HOW FREQUENTLY WERE THEY DOING THEM WE LOOK FOR GUIDANCE AND BEST PRACTICE AND THAT'S HOW WE ENDED ON THE THREE YEARS SO- TAKE TO HAVE THAT MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK. IF IT'S APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT MORE TECHNICAL LOOK EVERY TWO YEARS IS LIKE HEY I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE BUT- WE GAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN JUST THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT ASSESSMENT. OKAY SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS FOR AN AUDIT AND I ESSAY EVERY THREE YEARS. IT'S. WE SAY AN AUDIT OF INFORMATION SECURITY- IN OUR TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT WE TALK ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE IN IN THAT REPORT WE TALK ABOUT ENTITIES WERE ONLY LOOKING AT PORTIONS OF THEIR CONTROLS- IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT WE ACTUALLY VISITED SOME PLACES THAT ONLY HAD THE MILITARY ASSESSMENT DONE BUT THEY HAVEN'T EVALUATED OTHER ASPECTS THAT THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT HADN'T ADDRESSED SO WE RECOMMENDED A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT HERE- SO. OBVIOUSLY THE NON REPORTING ENTITIES ARE OUTSIDE THIS OTHER FRAMEWORKS- SO THEY WOULD HAVE DISCRETION ABOUT. DO THEY WANNA BRING IN THE MILITARY ASSESSMENTS AND SUPPLEMENT WITH AN AUDIT DO THEY WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER ENTITY WE DIDN'T SPECIFY THAT KNOWING THE ISSUES WITH INDEPENDENCE. OKAY AND THEN- FINALLY THE AUDIT DOESN'T SEEM TO INDICATE THAT- MILITARY DEPARTMENT AS ANY DIFFICULTY AND CONDUCTING I STAYS IN A TIMELY FASHION. YEAH A NON REPORTING ENTITIES COULD PER YOUR RECOMMENDATION EVEN CONTRACT WITH- THIRD PARTIES UNLIKE THE DEFAULT FOR REPORTING ENTITIES. YES YES. MAYBE THIS YEAR WILL BE ARE ARE A LUCKY YEAR FIVE I REALLY- I ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE- AUDITOR DOES- IT JUST GIVES INCREDIBLE INSIGHT ESPECIALLY IN THIS AREA THAT SO COMPLICATED EVERY TIME YOU COME BACK AND GIVE US GREAT. IDEAS FOR BILLS SO THANK YOU ARE RIGHT AND WE ARE- WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. AND APPARENTLY THE NUMBER THAT I GAVE BEFORE IS INCORRECT SO THAT NUMBER IS. ONE EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT. SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THEN THE ACCESS CODE IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE ONE TWO SIX AND I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF BY NAME AFFILIATION ANSWER PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF SO DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ONLINE. AT LEAST YOU DON'T SHE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME AGAINST. ONE ZERO. CURRENTLY NO PARTY'S QUEUING UP. OKAY WELL A AGAIN THANK YOU GENTLEMEN AND OF ALL FOUR OF YOU- THAT THIS WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL AND HOPEFULLY IN A FEW YEARS SHE'LL COME BACK AND DO THIS AGAIN AND THE REPORT WILL BE. IMPROVED WE CAN YOU KNOW I KNOW THEY HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENTS AS- IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WE'VE YOU KNOW CONSIDERING THE SITUATION WE WERE BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IN SPITE OF THIS REPORT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD- EVEN WITH THIS REPORT I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD NEGATE. EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE DONE THAT TO REALLY BRING UP- THE CYBERSECURITY MATURITY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IF YOU REMEMBER BACK THEN IT WAS NOT A PRETTY PICTURE. SO BUT WITH THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE AND WE APPRECIATE SAID- ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE TO. HELP POINT THAT OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THINK WITH THAT WE WILL. ADJOURN.
