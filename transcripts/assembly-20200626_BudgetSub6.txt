OKAY SEE NONE WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO OUR FIRST BILL AB EIGHTY NINE THIS IS AN AMENDMENT. TO THE BUDGET BILL DO WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DISTURBANCE FOR NATHAN ON THE ON THE LINE. THANK GOD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TO TAKE THIS ONE OUT AND FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I ALSO HAVE SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES. ON THE PHONE- SAID EXTENT AND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WILL INTO SOME DETAIL. BE REFERENCE THAT AS WELL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO OF THESE A- BUT AS YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR. THAT FIRST BILL ON THE AGENDA FOR EIGHT EIGHT EIGHTY NINE WHICH IS IN A- TO THE BUDGET BACK TWENTY TWENTY THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ON JUNE EIGHTEENTH COURSE IS A VERY BIG BILL WITH ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PROVISIONS OUT WHAT I'LL DO RIGHT NOW IS JUST TO THE- HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BILL THAT TOTAL ESTIMATED. ENSURE UNDER A SPELL ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITION- THE END OF THE BUDGET WE ARE PROJECTS- SERVICE ACT IN EWING EVEN AFTER THAT INCLUDES. THE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SIX RESERVE AND EIGHT POINT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE RAINY DAY FUND AFTER ONE TRANSFER IS MADE FOR THE BUDGET. IN ADDITION WE WOULD TWO POINT SIX AND DOLLARS IN THE SPECIAL FUND FRACKING UNCERTAINTY IS TO ADDRESS. EMERGENCIES OR OTHER PERSON ADVANCE. LAST POINT I'LL MAKE ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THIS BILL- BASED ON A LOT OF DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE- IS THAT IT DOES INCLUDE. SO NOW WITH THE CUT GOING TO A FACT BUT IF FEDERAL FUNDS ARE RECEIVED BY OCTOBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY AND WITH THE AMOUNT OF FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. THOSE CUTS WILL BE RESTORED IN A IN A WHILE NEGOTIATION AND DISCUSSION. ABOUT THE CONTENT THAT OUT SELECT. IN ELKS AND DEFINE IF THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO COMMAND BUT THEY'RE UNDER FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL BE. ON A- BASIS. SO THAT'S RIGHT. TO TAKE SINCE. QUESTION THE COMMITTEE. BEFORE THE QUESTION WE GO HELP MR PANIC WITH LEO. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MR VICE CHAIR- AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BUT WERE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. VERY WILL WILL US FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT BILLS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR IT'S NOT A QUESTION FOR MR PADDOCK WELL WE'VE GOT YOU HERE. THE STATE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES US TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET SO THIS IS THE- AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO BALANCE REVENUES WITH EXPENSE YOURS BUT WONDERING ABOUT YOUR OPINION OF WHETHER NOT. BALANCE GIVEN THE FACT THAT SO MUCH ON DEFERRALS ON LOANSKNOWN INTER FUND TRANSFERS TO ACHIEVE- THAT THAT EQUILIBRIUM. BUT YES MISTER OBERNOLTE- WELL I WOULD JUST SAY UP FRONT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF INSIGHT ABOUT SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT GO INTO THE PACKAGE- BUT- USE OF DEFERRALS AND INTER FUND LOANS ARE. A SOURCE AT ONE TIME RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- KICKSTAND THEY'RE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE BUDGET YOU'RE EXPENDITURES THEY COULD CONSIDER. AS CONTRIBUTING TO BUDGETARY BALANCE. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A PERMISSIBLE USE OF THOSE FUNDS TAT WE CAN POINT AT THIS BUDGET AND SAY THIS IS A BALANCED. PERMISSIBLE IT DOES TO SOME EXTENT YOUR RISK TOLERANCE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ECONOMY DOES NOT CONTINUE IN A RECOVERY MODE AND IF THE IF THE RECOVERY BEGAN TO ALTER OVER THE COURSE OF THE COMING. THEN I THINK THE LATER WOULD BE FACED WITH MAKING MORE AND DEEPER- ONGOING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE EXPENDITURE BASE- NEXT YEAR SO TO SOME EXTENT YOU KNOW THERE'S A CHOICE THAT YOU'RE MAKING BY USING A ONE TIME RESOURCES DISH THERE. WEST OF THEM WERE BORN WE YEARS IF THEY WOULD BE NAY. I CERTAINLY SHARE YOUR AND I ALSO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN WHICH IS THAT. I BELIEVE THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROVISION OUR STATE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES A BALANCED BUDGET IS TO SAY WE CANNOT DEFINITELY SPEND. OUT OF A RECESSION THAT POWER THE DEFENDER FROM IT HAS THAT. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE AND I FEAR THAT WHEN WE TRY TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET BY BORROWING FROM. FUNDS TO BE THE GENERAL FUND WILL ALMOST TO PAY IT BACK IN THE FUTURE NO DIFFERENT REALLY THE DEFICIT SPENDING. WITH THE TREASURY BONDS AWAY THE GOVERNMENT AND SO. WHILE OF THAT. CONCERN WITH THE IT THE DEBATE ABOUT THE HAS BEEN ACHIEVED SURE NOT. NINE OKAY SEEING NONE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT FOR MAYBE EIGHTY NINE PLEASE COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU LOST. IS THERE ANYBODY IN A STOCK STATE.

AB SEVENTY EIGHT. YES AB SEVENTY EIGHT FIRST I TO THE I BANKRUPT CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THANK AND WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DOIS IT WOULD ESTABLISH A CLIMATE CATALYST FOR OF ALL ON FIND A NIGHT THAT. THIS WILL MAKE ANY POSSIBLE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE MORE ATTRACTIVE- WHEN THEY HAVE A PLACE TO DEPOSIT THAT FUNDING- AND THIS FUND WOULD BE. ADMINISTERED BY THE AYE BANK BUT WITH HELP FROM THE WEB OR FORCE NOT AGENCY. AS DISTRICT ROAD COUNT. ONE EMPHASIZE THAT. IS WAITING TO GHOST AN AGREEMENT THE ADMIN. FINE NO BY WILL BE APPROPRIATED FROM DAYS FIND- WITHOUT THAT% CONSENTED SELECT. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS ON AB SEVENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- WHEN I WATCHED THE HEARING ON THE SENATE SIDE I SAW OUR SENATOR FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE SPEAK ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT I ALSO WANTED TO ELEVATE HERE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT ARE GONE THROUGH A POLICY COMMITTEE I WOULD LIKE TO. ADD A BIT OF- PERSONAL REFLECTION ON A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE PASSED AT THE STATE CALLED FORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES. AND AS WE LOOK TOWARD THIS AYE BANK SPEND SOME OF THEIR FUNDS ON I JUST WANT TO SPEAK PERSONALLY TO. THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THE MARK. THIS WAS AN EXAMPLE WHERE OUR COMMUNITY CAME TOGETHER AND IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITY A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND DECIDED FOR OURSELVES WHICH PROGRAMS WE WANTED TO INVEST IN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND TRANSFORM OUR- IF WE MADE INVESTMENTS AND THINGS LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PERMACULTURE GARDEN. WE MADE INVESTMENTS INTO URBAN GREEN. MAKING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN A DISTRICT THAT NEVER HAD SOME OF THOSE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE STRENGTH OF THIS PROGRAM AND HOPE. THAT THIS AYE BANK CAN FIND IT. TO WORK THROUGH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO MAKE SIMILAR INVESTMENTS LIKE THIS. INTO PLACES LIKE THIS CYNICAL ABOUT THE PLACES LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE. PLACES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY NEEDED THOSE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS AND- LOOK INTO THE ADMINISTRATION TO DRIVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER WILL NOT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VISIT NATHAN HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE REVENUE BONDS THAT THIS TRAILER BILL AUTHORIZES- THE CLIMB A CATALYST REVOLVING LOAN FUND TO ISSUE. OUT WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE WHAT BONDS WOULD BE ISSUED AND HOW WITH THOSE BONDS. SO IT'S A RIGHT NOW AND I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE- TO RESET CALVERT AS WELL AS GOING COME ON THE LINE IN TERMS OF THAT PROCEDURE- BUT I WILL SAY THAT- RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS SPECIFIC FIND- DOESN'T HAVE. THE MONEY IN IT AND EVEN IF DID IT IN A PROBLEM. JUST WAIT. REYES INTO THOSE THINGS WERE HAPPEN BUT LET ME TURN IT. AT TO RESEARCH AND INTO QUITE IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT. THE PROCEDURE REPAIRS AND AS YOU KNOW THE AYE BANK HAS OTHER PROGRAMS- THAT MAY OPERATE IN A SIMILAR WAY SO FIRST TO RESEND THEM TO QUITE. GOOD MORNING TO READ THE COVER FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES THIS FUND IS A AND THAT'S LANGUAGE SET UP A FRAMEWORK PRINTED FUND IN ANTICIPATION OF FUTURE FEDERAL FUNDS AND AGAIN IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION. SO I'M NOT DON'T HAVE THOSE BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT TIME. ALL RIGHT INDICATE THAT CLICK HELP CALLUM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING IT- BUT BASIC LAID OUT THAT. WHETHER THIS WOULD BE BONTA GRANT OR THAT FINANCING STRUCTURE WOULD ROUTE REALLY REALLY BE DEPENDENT ON WHAT. THE AND- GRAIN. IN PLACE THOSE OUR PEOPLE THAT ARE PROVIDE THE FIND OUR ORIGINAL WHICH ISN'T CONTEMPLATED HERE WHAT INTO BONDS PROGRAM BUT MORE O A FINANCING PROGRAM TO ADDRESS GAPS USING EXISTING- USING GENERAL FUND MONEY. SO FOLLOW ON QUESTION IF WE'RE NOT ANTICIPATING ON USING BONDS TO FUND. THE CLIMATE CATALYST REVOLVING LOAN FUND THEN WHY IS THERE LANGUAGE IN THIS TRAILER BILL AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF THOSE BONDS. SO I CAN SPEAK TO THAT AND THEN- QUITE CAN WAY AND ALSO THE REASON THAT WE WANTED TO CREATE AS AS YOU KNOW IN ANYWHERE IN THE GOVERNOR HAD OPPOSED TO RAP FOR. YOUR PERIOD PUTTING ONE PERSON GENERAL I'M INTO A CLIMATE CATALYST ONE PROPOSAL OF COURSE WITH THE PANDEMIC ANY ECONOMIC FACTS- THAT- FUN THINGS ROLLED AND IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. ARE THE KIND OF KIND OF TIME THANK YOU- ASSETS OF. NOT INITIAL THINKING THAT WE HAD HAD IN JAN. THERE WERE NOT BE BONTA ALL THE REASON THE THAT LINE. IS IN THE TRAILER BILL IS THAT WE FOR EXAMPLE. LINK FROM THE FEDERAL BUT FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CONTINGENT ON SAID IN SOME TYPE BOND PROGRAM. BACKED BY THOSE FARMS. THEN THAT CASE WE WANT TO RETAIN THE ABILITY TO DO THAT OF COURSE DOESGOT TO BE A- THE LEGISLATURE. BEFORE WE CANNOT ON THOSE FINES AS A BACK SO THIS IS BASICALLY WELL WE HAD ONE WAY OF DOING THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO IN A DIFFERENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. IF THE FEDERAL INCOME GROWTH WITH ANOTHER SET OF CONSTRUED. WITH MAKE SURE WE CAN. IT WOULD BE BACK. UNDER THE CAR I'M MORE WE WERE TO ADD FIND IT WOULDN'T BE A FUND OUTLOOK. I AM. I THINK IT'S ON FOR THAT THE LANGUAGE IS STILL THERE OF THE IN IS CURRENTLY NOT TO USE. REVENUE BOND THAT I THINK THAT WE SHOULDN'T AUTHORIZE THE USE OF REVENUE BONDS AND IN THE FUTURE AS YOU SAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- ALTERS THE CONDITIONS FOR THE PROVISION OF THE- THANK YOU CAN ALWAYS COME. BACK TO US IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN. GET THE OP STATIONED AT THAT- THAT USED TO THE PROGRAM I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE IT TO HAVE IT UP FRONT WHEEL BUT WORRIED ABOUT DRIVING THE STATE FURTHER INTO. THE WOODEN DON'T HAVE A PLAN. BOB WITH THE RIVER. THANK YOU. YOUR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY GOING TO PUBLIC COMMENT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON AB SEVENTY EIGHT.

THANK YOU MISTER PHONE. BUT STILL PALMER FINANCE COULD YOU AS A COULD YOU GIVE ME SOME CLARIFICATION ON THE MANAGED CARE EFFICIENCIES SECTION. IT STATES THAT THE AS YOU PROPOSE THESE- RISK CORRIDORS AND PUT A PROPOSED RATE CUTS THAT IT SHALL BE IMPLEMENTED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY NECESSARY FEDERAL APPROVALS ARE OBTAINED. AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL PROVISIONS AVAILABLE AND IS NOT OTHERWISE JEOPARDIZE IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD RECEIVE APPROVAL FROM CMS- AT TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS TO THE STATE AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE SAVINGS FROM THE MANAGED CARE FOR HIS. PROPOSALS WITH THIS PERTAIN VERSE. BACK GOVERNMENT. YES SO I HAVE RYAN MILLER ON THE LINE I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD THOSE EXACT TYPES OF PERCENTAGES ARREST MAKES WITH US RIGHT NOW ABOUT RYAN KIDS.

AND CO GOOD RESPONSE BUT ALTERNATIVE ACTUALLY TO MY COLLEAGUE JACOB LAMB TO MEET THE NEEDS TO SPEAK SOME OF THE MORE DETAILED THE ASPECTS OF THE QUESTION. ARTICLE ONE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I CALL THE WRANGLER IS CORRECT THIS IS FAIRLY STANDARD LANGUAGE THAT WE INCLUDE IN THE MAJORITY OF OUR MEDI CAL- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BECAUSE THIS IS A- PROGRAM THAT RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE ANY CHANGES THAT WOULD FURTHER JEOPARDIZE THAT FUNDING MOVING FORWARD. I DO NOT HAVE THE SPECIFIC FOLDER IN FACT FOR THE EVENING. AND BUT I CAN'T. ALL THAT UP AND SHARE WITH ALL. THAT WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED OKAY BUT ARE YOU ARE YOU PROJECTING SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS COMING TO THE STATE OR IS IT IS IT NATURALLY. IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY OCCUR WHERE SOME OF IT COMES TO THE STATE AND SOME OF IT GETS SENT BACK TO THE FOR A GOVERNMENT. BOB PORTION OF THE SAVINGS WOULD BE RETURNING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT BE PAYING THE SAME RATE. OF HOWEVER BASED OFF. WHAT WE'RE TRACKING WE ARE ASSUMING- SAVINGS OF EIGHTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND AND BUDGET YOUR FROM THE MANAGED CARE OF PATIENTS THE- AND- I CAN AND I CAN PULL UP THE INFORMATION FOR THE ONE POINT 5% RATE ADJUSTMENTS OR WITHDRAW THAT THAT BE PERFECT I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THE EXPANSION OF FULL SCOPE MEDICAL BENEFITS TO UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS WAS BEING- SUSPENDED THIS YEAR BUT IT WAS GOING TO BE PRIORITIZED IN FUTURE BUDGET YEARS AND THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT DEFINES THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH- THAT WOULD OCCUR. AND LINKS IT TO THE BALANCE OF THE SFE YOU FUND- HOWEVER WERE MAKING A LOT OF OTHER PAINFUL CUTS IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT'S OF ALMOST A BILLION. TO CSU IN PERSON IF CALIFORNIA'S ARE YOU SAYING THAT IN FUTURE YEARS- AS ECONOMY RECOVERS THIS EXPANSION MEDI CAL WILL CURB FOR THOSE CUTS ARE STORED. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THIS- WE'RE SIGNALING THAT THIS WILL BE A PRIORITY- THAT BEING SAID THE LEGISLATURE OF WILL HAVE TO APPROVE A BUDGET WITH FUNDING FOR THOSE ITEMS IN IT BEFORE IT GOES. FORWARD AND WE ARE CERTAINLY HOPING THAT THE ECONOMY WILL RECOVER AS ROBUSTLY AS POSSIBLE BUT AS YOU MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET MISTER VICE CHAIR- WE DO HAVE SOME WAYS. TO GET THERE. OKAY WELL I MEAN JUST PERSONALLY ON ON A HOT I KNOW I'M NOT ALONE IN THIS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO- PRIORITIZE. EXPANDING THIS ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM AHEAD OF RESTORING THE CUTS THAT WERE HAVING TO MAKE. TWO OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY EXIST THIS YEAR SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S THE COMPROMISE THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO. THE BUDGET MOVE POOR BUT I THINK IT'S VERY TRUE. THAT THE LANGUAGE WAS WRITTEN IN THE WAY WAS. GREAT THE THANK YOU MISTER IN YOU KNOW I THINK OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING IT'S THAT THE HEALTH OF EACH OF US IS DEPENDENT ON THE HEALTH OF ALL OF US. AND THAT SHOULD BE A RALLYINGCRY FOR WHY WE WORK TOWARDS HEALTH FOR ALL. AND I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS THE DRIVE TO WORK TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND THAT THE INTENSE LANGUAGE THAT'S PRESENT IN THIS BILL WHILE NOT PERFECT IS. STILL WORKING TOWARDS IT ANTI WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERN AND FRUSTRATION I OUR CALL ON THE SENATE SIDE FROM LOS ANGELES. AND ELEVATE THE ISSUE BUT KNOW THAT WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN LEADING ON THAT ISSUE. AND WORKING WITH OUR DOCTOR POPULATION TO GET THEM COVERAGE RIGHT NOW THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. WHILE WE'RE ON. EIGHTY THOUGH I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR SUPPORT. YESTERDAY SENATOR BELL HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT IT AND WAS ASKING ABOUT A WAIVER THAT CURRENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING. AND I WOULD JUST ECHO SUPPORT FOR THE INCLUSION OF PEER SUPPORT AND THAT WAIVER REQUEST AS IT MAY ALLOW US TO PULL DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS AND UTILIZE SAY- OF NEW WORST WAY FOR US TO BETTER MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT. I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE AFTER THIS PANDEMIC IS A TSUNAMI OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ISSUES AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED PEER SUPPORTS pTSUNAMI AND WE JUST ASK THE ADMINISTRATION. TO PREPARE FOR IT BY INCLUDING IT IN THEIR WAY FOR THAT THEY'RE MAKING TO OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU EITHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEE NOT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. SINGLE PUBLIC COMMENT WAS GOOD AB EIGHTY TWO. AB EIGHT HERE IS THAT GENERAL STATE GOVERNMENT TRAILER BILL NUMBER PROVISIONS I'LL JUST MENTION THREE OF THEM FIRST IS RELATED TO THE- CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT- SHIFTING SOME INVESTIGATORS FROM THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATIONS TO THE BUREAU CANNABIS CONTROL A SECOND ITEM OF THIS BILL OF NO FOR WAYS TO BROADBAND. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THERE'S A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR A FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. FUNDING GRAHAM WHICH CALIFORNIA Y. TO DO APPLY LOGIC. PRINT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS TRAILER BILL BASICALLY NUMBER ASK CHANGES RELATED TO THE STRUCTURE OF THAT CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND ENABLE THE STATE BETTER COMPETE FOR THOSE GREAT. NAY BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO PROVIDE A FUN. IT'S RELATED TO COLLECTION OF USED CAR SALES TAX. ANY QUESTIONS MISTER BROUGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'VE FIVE MOST OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL SUPPORTABLE BUT I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT A NEW PROGRAM ESTABLISHED IN THE TRAILER BILL AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD TELL US WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S A LOT EARNERS FOR NET AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. GRAHAM TELL ME WHY THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED HOW MUCH FUNDING IS ALLOCATED TO IT. YES ON THIS LET ME TURN IT OVER TO I'VE GOT ERICA LEE ON THE PHONE AND EITHER SHE OR SOMEONE ON THAT WOULD AND A HAT THOUGH- THIS UNIT WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT. HI GANG UP AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THE PHOTO ON PAGE ONE YOUR AD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE TRAINING AND WORK MICHAEL GRANTS TO INDIVIDUALS. AT THE FIVE TARGET POPULATE. SUPPORT THEM. MARCHING ENTERTAINING OUR SMALL BUSINESS IN THE STATE AND THEIR TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME AND BUDGET FOR THAT. THANK YOU AND TELL US WHAT THOSE TARGET POPULATIONS ARE. SURE AND AGAIN DANIEL BRANDON FINANCE INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFESSOR PROFICIENCY AB REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION OR CITIZENSHIP STATUS AND ALSO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NEED ARE UNITED STATES CITIZENS AND LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS WHICH INCLUDED BUT NOT LIMITED. ACTIONSCHILD DIVIDE TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS. LAW AND IS THERE A PARALLEL SEED PROGRAM FOR IMMIGRANTS THAT DO HAVE LEGAL STATUS IN CALIFORNIA. SO I CAN- IS IT JUST SPEAK MORE BROADLY I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE ENTREPRENEURSHIP- AT BUT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL INCLUDING IN THIS OVERALL BUDGET PACKAGE- THERE IS EXTENDED FROM THE MIDDLE FRANCHISE TAX. THIS IS A MAP YEAR SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE A COMPARATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING. FOR POPULATIONS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER RESOURCES. OKAY I UNDERSTAND I FIND A VERY TROUBLING THOUGH THAT WERE YOU MIGHT CONSIDER TEN MILLION DOLLARS SMALL AND MAYBE IN THE CONTEXT. OF THE STATE BUDGET SMALL BUT IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER MONEY AND I THINK THAT THE VERY INAPPROPRIATE. THOSE FOUGHT ESPECIALLY NEARLY A FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT. IN YOU KNOW MAY I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS BACKGROUND I'VE ADVOCATED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND CERTAINLY- SEED MONEY FOR HELPING PEOPLE ESTABLISH A SMALL BUSINESSES SOMETHING ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. BUT TO LIMIT THE ABILITY. AS WE DO IN THE- BILL TO RESIDENTS THAT LACK DOCUMENTED IMMIGRATION STATUS I THINK IS A- SUCH A SUCH A BAD PRECEDENT. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

SO EIGHTY EIGHTY FOUR IS A TRAILER BILL RELATED TO CALPERS AND CAL STARS- AND BASICALLY- THE KEY PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL- AND MANY WAYS INTERACT WITH A TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT OF THE TWENTY NINETY BUDGET ACT HAD MADE A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION OR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. CALPERS AND SCHEDULED FOR AND- ADDITIONAL SOME PAYMENTS OVER THE THREE YEARS. THAT DECISION WAS OF COURSE MADE IN A VERY DIFFERENT FISCAL ENVIRONMENT THAN THE ONE WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW SO WHAT THIS BUDGET DOES IS IT TAKES NEARLY ALL THAT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT. AND USES IT SEC CALLOUSED. COPPERS CHANGE BOTH IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY WE DO NOT MAKE THAT ARE NOT OUR- THREE YEARS ANYMORE AT THE FISCAL PRESSURES A NEED TO RE DIRECT THAT TO A BASE PRIORITIES IN ADDITION THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT HAD PROVIDED TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO WORD- PENSION RELIEF LONG TERM FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYERS THIS BILL RE DIRECT THAT TO PROVIDE PENSION RELIEF OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS- AND FINALLY THE- GET ONE YEAR. ARE FREE WHEN IT COMES TO A CONTRIBUTION ASTERS PLAN. MR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO ISN'T DIVERTING THIS TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS AWAY FROM- THE PENSION SYSTEM GOING TO ROUTE INCREASE THE LONG TERM- UNFUNDED LIABILITY BUT THEN THAT'S- SO IT IS THE CASE. OBERNOLTE THAT- WITH THAT PENSION CONTRIBUTION THE MORE YOU PUT IT AT ANY LEVEL THE MORE YOU PUT IN THE GREATER YOUR SAVINGS ARE OVERTIME SO ONE OF THE REASONS THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT HAD MADE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAIN. IS TO ACHIEVE THINGS TIME. CORRECT THAT I SHOULD HOWEVER THAT THESE PAYMENTS WERE ALWAYS DESIGNED TO BE AND WORK A LOT OF THE ACTUAR WE REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION. TO THE STATE IS NOT SO SPENDING IT'S REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION THERE'S NO PENSION HOLIDAY OF ANY TYPE THIS IS SIMPLY SAYING THAT ARE MAKING THE- VISION. TO MAKE BUT- SHOULD NOT BE SHARES WERE NOT PHYSICIAN TO MAKE THOSE RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE NEED TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE- UNFUNDED LIABILITY IN PERSON STIRS IS. SO I HAVE A THE APPROXIMATE RANGE OF FIGURES AND I ALSO HAVE EVELYN SUITS ON THE PHONE- TO PROVIDE MORE EXACT FIGURE BUT GENERALLY IN TERMS OF RANGE AS- THE STATE'S SHARE OF THE PERSONAL LIABILITY. IS AROUND SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS I FOR CALLOUSED ERRORS IT'S GENERALLY AROUND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. SO WHEN USED TO THE WORK IN THE ACTUAR ONLY REQUIRED. CONTRIBUTIONS YOU'RE REFERRING TO STATE LAW NOT TO. THE NECESSITY OF FUNDING THOSE PENSION SYSTEMS. THAT IS CORRECT ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT THESE REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS ALSO INCLUDE- DOLLARS TO MAKE UP FOR THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THAT HAS ACCRUED OVER TIME. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T FALL TO SAID- YES SO- WHEN AN UNFUNDED A LIABILITY- DEVELOPS- THE STATUS IS REQUIRED TO PAY THAT OFF OVER TIME SO. THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THE STATE MAKES ARE BOTH CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE NORMAL COST OF PENSIONS- ADVERTISE ALLEGATIONS IN THE PRESENT YEAR- BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PASSED UNFUNDED LIABILITIES NOW YOU CAN CERTAINLY MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT- STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS SHOULD BE MAKING. THOSE PAYMENTS ON UNFUNDED LIABILITIES MORE QUICKLY- BUT THAT IS PART OF A CONTRIBUTION- THAT'S REQUIRED OF THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ONCE. QUESTIONS PUBLIC COMMENT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. I SEE NO PUBLIC COMMENT WAS MOVED AB AT IT. EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHT IS THE PUBLIC SAFETY TRAILER BILL AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL SO LET ME JUST MENTION A COUPLE VERY BRIEFLY AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS INCLUDING ON SOME ELEMENTS THAT MAY NOT HAVE COME UP- THE FIRST BASED ON A LOT OF DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE- IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE STATE TO IDENTIFY. A STATE OWNED PRISON OFFICIALS FOR CLOSER BOTH ON JANUARY TENTH OF NEXT YEAR AND GENERATE TEN A YEAR AFTER SO THAT'S THE CURRENT PLAN WHICH TOLD TO CLOSE THE STATE IT'S- OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AT THIS LAYS OUT WINDOWS PRESENCE NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED FOR CLOSURE AND WE HOPE IF THIS PROCESS. INVOLVES BUT THAT WILL RESULT IN SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. A SECOND ITEM OF NOTE IS A BAND THE BOX TYPE OF PROVISION FOR POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS- WHICH MEANS THAT. SHOULD NOT BE ENQUIRING ABOUT CRIMINAL HISTORY DURING THE OUT PATIENT AND ADMISSIONS PROCESS- IT WOULD STILL ALLOW. A-CONSIDERATION OF THAT HISTORY AT BEFORE THE ENROLLMENT DECISION IS MADE- BUT THIS IS RELATED TO THE ADMISSIONS APPLICATION PROCESS. IN IS THE X. OF OUR COURT APPEARANCES FOURTH AT BASED ON A LOT OF DISCUSSION IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW MAXIMUM TERM FOR PAROLE FOR MOST OFFENDERS- AND THEN FAITH IS. A DEFINITION. WHAT CAUGHT IT'S AN S. TO REFLECT THE STATE'S OUT ONCE. RULES WORK OUR AT OR SALE ASSAULT WEAPONS BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. MISERABLE TO THE SO I UNDERSTAND HOW THE DEBATE ABOUT CLOSING A STATE PRISON- IS FISCAL AND I UNDERSTAND WHY WERE HAVING THAT DISCUSSION IN THE CONTEXT OF TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGET BUT THE THINGS THAT YOU DETAILS TO BE POLICY CHANGES AND NOT BUDGETARY- SO HOW ARE THINGS LIKE REDUCING THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF STAY TO PRICE PAROLE. AUTHORIZING MISDEMEANOR DIVERT OVER OVER THE OBJECTION OF PROSECUTORS EXPANDING THE EARLY RELEASE OF CRIMINALS FROM STATE PRISONS HOW HOW ARE THOSE- OF FISCAL AND NOT POLICY AND WHY ARE WE HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS NOW. TRAILER BILL. THAN HAVING THOSE BILLS TO SEE PROCESS. YES MISTER OBERNOLTE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ON THIS- BUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT THESE- IMPLEMENT THE BUDGET BELT- THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND RELATED TO. PROVISIONS OF THE CHECK- AND PART OF THE OVERALL FISCAL PLAN AND WE BELIEVE IN MANY IF NOT MOST OF THESE CASES OF THESE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AND DEBATED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS- SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE PRO. FOR INCLUSION HERE. WELL I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND I KNOW THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE. ON BOTH SIDES OF THESE ISSUES HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT THE REASON WHY WE HAVE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE DEBATES IN A PUBLIC FORUM. AND WE'RE NOT DOING THAT HERE WERE RUSHING THROUGH THIS AND A BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND I THINK THAT'S- YOU KNOW VERY WERE. THIS COOPER. THIS IS FOR FINANCE- I THINK I'M GONNA HANG ON THE LESS WE'RE JUST SAID FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION SO ONE OF THE MOST MINUTE VERSION PROPOSAL THIS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING CRIME ANNOYING OR MOLESTING A CHILD POSITION IT'S NOT YOUR FEE SEXUAL BATTERY. ONE WE'RE STILL SIX OF THIS. TIER ONE PRESIDENT. MISDEMEANOR CHILD PORN ORAL COPULATION IN SEXUAL BATTERY. CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE RATIONALE FOR INCLUDING SEX CRIMES IS ELIGIBLE FOR MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION. YES WHEN WE TURN IT OVER AT WE HAVE BOTH CLICK CAL ON AND ERIN EDWARDS ON THE PHONE- WHEN WE TURN IT OVER TO THEM TO SPEAK TO THAT. GOOD MORNING THIS IS ERIN I'VE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WITH RESPECT TO. THOSE PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF CRIME- THEY I SUPPOSE COULD POTENTIALLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS MISDEMEANOR PROGRAM IN THE SENSE THAT. THE PROGRAM CREATE. ARE A DIVERSION PROGRAMS. ANY MISDEMEANOR OFFENSE- AND SO IN THAT SENSE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY BE ELIGIBLE NOW IN TERMS OF THE RATIONALE FOR NOT EXCLUDING PARTICULAR TYPES OF CRIMES- THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL SO I CANNOT. SPEAK TO THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THAT- WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT- TO THE AT THE LEGISLATION DOCTORS REQUIRE- JUDICIAL- DISCRETION AND REVIEW- AND SO IT WAS ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY JUDGE. HAD A QUESTION OF WHETHER IT WAS A PRO. YEAH BUT SOMEONE IN ONE OF THE- HAVE IS THAT RIGHT. INTO THE JUDGE COULD CERTAINLY BLOCK THAT FROM. WELL YOU SAID POTENTIALLY YOU IS THERE SO THAT THAT'S WHEN THINGS THAT WERE THE IS LEGISLATION WE'RE- IT'S BEEN WRITTEN AND YOU HAVE OF- APPLYING DONE IT SO. I HAVE ISSUE WITH POTENTIALLY SO EITHER IT IS OR ISN'T SUMMIT TAKE THAT AS THEY ARE ELIGIBLE CORRECT. THEY ARE ALL BOATS PRACTICE IN AND WHAT'S THE REASON BEHIND THAT AND I'LL PUT TO SOMETHING WHEN DURING COLD IN NINETEEN- THE SUPREME COURT WAY THEN SAID WE'RE GONNA HAVE NO BILL TO REDUCE POPULATIONS FROM OUR JAILS AND- PRISONS. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT CLOSELY. THE SAME CHARGES THE SUPREME COURT EXCLUDED. SO I MEAN THE I THINK THEY SAW THE POTENTIAL SOLVE THE ISSUES WITH IT AND SOME THE PUBLIC OUTCRY SO THE CHANGE FROM A LOST ANY POSITION OF INCLUDING EVERYBODY AND- TO EXEMPTING THESE FOLKS FROM THIS. SO I'M TRYING TO RATIONALIZE THAT AND CORRELATE THE TWO. SURE SO AGAIN I. CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE FOUGHT CROPPED UP OF THE LEGISLATURE. THIS IS THE SENATE PROPOSAL ON SO I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE- THOUGHT PROCESS THAT WENT BEHIND IT BUT I WOULD SAY. AGAIN THAT YOU KNOW IN THOSE PARTICULAR CATEGORIES THE DESCRIBING THE JUDGE DOES HAVE THE DISCRETION TO. PREVENT SOMEONE FROM ENTERING INTO THIS PROGRAM. I THINK THE BROADER RATIONALE. GETTING THE DIVERSION PROGRAM TO YOUR LEFT IS THAT. IT IS. IT AN ATTEMPT TO SORT OF BREAK BREAK THIS CYCLE OF CRIME- AND ALLOW FOR THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS TO INDIVIDUALS. OTHERWISE YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK. CREATE OPPORTUNITY TO REHABILITATE TOPS AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WATER RATIONALE FOR. CREATING THE PROGRAM TO BE. THE BOTTOM LINE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS IT SO THE SENATE MAY HAVE. MANUFACTURED WELL WITH THE MINISTRATIONS OF SAID WE A BIG ISSUE WITH IT. WOULD SAY I DON'T SEE ANY MY COLLEAGUES. THE PUBLIC. TALKING ABOUT IN SUPPORTING THESE FOR TOM LESS SEXUAL BATTERY. IF YOU GRAB. IN PRIVATE PLACES I'M THINGS LIKE CHILD **** ORAL COPULATION SEXUAL BATTERY I DON'T SEE ANYBODY AND I SAID NO CONSTITUENTS CALL ME AND SUPPORTED GETTING FOLKS LIKE THAT WITH THE MISDEMEANORS AND ALSO WAS WHICH WAS TROUBLES AND ALSO THIS IS ALSO FOR FINANCE. IT TALKS ABOUT PROHIBITS SECONDARY EDUCATION SO IF THIS IS LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS SEE A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS RUN THROUGH COLLEGES AND ONE HERE SECOND RUN THROUGH COLLEGE. APPLY AND THE WILL HAVE TO REBUILD PAST HISTORY. THEY MAY GRADUATE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING PROGRAM. AND THEN GET HIRED IT MAY NOT BE THAT'S BOSTON YU SEE THAT THAT RUNS THAT PROGRAM GET HIRED BY SOMEBODY ELSE. AND WHICH IS TO GO TO WORK AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY I'M JUST WONDERING FINANCE WHO WHO DO THE RESEARCH ON THAT. AND DO YOU SEE THAT AS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM OCCURRING. THAT WE- CHRIS FERGUSON I THE LINE WHO ARE BEAR YOU CAN BEGIN ON. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT ONE WILL PROBABLY MORE APPROPRIATE FOR EITHER CUENTA FOR PRESS. THIS IS CHRIS FERGUSON BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN- FEEL THAT THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE AROUND- ADMISSIONS AND NOT ENQUIRING DOES NOT APPLY TO A BASIC LAW ENFORCEMENT RANKING PROGRAM SO. PROGRAM CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM THOSE TRACKS. OKAY. AND THEN ALSO JUST ONE MORE THING ACTUALLY COUPLE MORE THINGS- UNDER NUMBER TEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. GONNA COMPASSIONATE RELEASE RIGHT NOW THE BOARD OF FOR SOMEONE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO TAKE IT FROM SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS THE BORDER PATROLS ALWAYS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY GET TO REVIEW THE PACKAGE THEY GOT IN THE KNOWLEDGE AND DETAILS OF WHAT THAT. PERSON'S HISTORY IS AND WHAT THE THREAT IS WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S RATIONALE FOR REMOVING THE BOARD APPROVAL FROM THAT PROCESS. ALL RIGHT. YES BUT CALLEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THAT REMOVING THE BOARD SEEMS LIKE- DUPLICATIVE PROCESS- IT'S A CLINICIAN MAKING A DETERMINATION ON SOMEONE'S- LIKELY ARE ACTUALLY HAVING A TERMINAL ILLNESS THAT WAY THAT THEY'RE LIKE WOOD AND WITHIN SIX MONTHS ORIGINALLY NOW BEING MOVED TO TWELVE MONTHS- THAT IS SORT OF THE MARKER FOR THAT AND THAT ALWAYS GOES TO THE SECRETARY FOR DECISION AND THEN DOCTOR REFERRED TO THE COURT- FOR FINAL DETERMINATION SO IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE- THE BOARDS- INPUT IN THAT PROCESS WAS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE- GIVEN THAT ULTIMATELY THE COURT THAT MAKES A DECISION. AND IF THE CLINICIAN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION ARE UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITION THAT MAKES THEM ELIGIBLE YOU TALK ABOUT CLINICIAN BUT THE BOARD IT'S BEEN IN EFFECT FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE BEEN AFFECTED WITH THAT SO I'M IF THIS REASON IF THAT WAS TO BE A BETTER PROCESS WITH THAT I AND I'M A- PASSED NEARLY. BUT ONE MAKE SURE THAT THE END OF THE DAY NUMBER ONE IS THE PUBLIC SAFETY IS THE PUBLIC SAFETY IS ASSURED AND I THINK BY HAVING POWER MANY DAYS THIS IS THE PLACE TO ASSESS IT WORK BUT I'M GOT THAT. ALSO IN WHEN THE AGE. WHAT DO THE- YES THERE IS AN EXPANSION TO THE ELDERLY PRO PROGRAM I THINK. THE BAY. TWENTY IN YOUR HEIRS OF PARKER CENTER HERE'S A- TWENTY EIGHT YEARS CARS ARE THAT THAT MAY SOMEONE A LEGIT FOR LIFE FOR SUITABILITY AND- I AS YOU OF STATE THAT THE VERY. OF RGOROUS PROCESS THAT CLINICAL RESEARCH. BANDS BUT COMMITTEE REVIEW. INCLUDE THE A- VICTIM PARTICIPATION- AND THOSE THAT ARE RELEASED TO THAT PROPER TIME INCREDIBLY LOW RECIDIVISM RATE I THINK IT'S AROUND. 224% AND EVEN THOUGH THAT RISK. RIGHT RIGHT NOW THE VICTIM BUT I I'M NOT I MAY DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING VICTIMS DON'T. THE WAY THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW VICTIMS DON'T HAVE A SAY SO IN SOME OF THESE ISSUES WITH THAT. I BELIEVE THERE'S NOTIFICATION AND- AND THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO PROVIDE INPUT- ON THAT. IN INTO THOSE HEARINGS- BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS- TWO SIDES TO EVERY DISCUSSION. BUT THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE. YOU KNOW A GOOD WAY TO MAKE RELEASED DECISIONS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE INCARCERATED. OKAY THANK YOU IT WAS REPORTED. THANK YOU THAT MR TRIES WHEN I ASK ABOUT TO. TWO ISSUES THAT I WAS TRYING TO PULL UP THE ACTUAL BILL RIGHT HERE AND I COULDN'T GET IN TIME BUT ONLY NOW SAYS ABOUT THIS WHOLE BAND THE BOXING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'M- NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT WROTE THAT BAN THE BOX LAWYER TWO YEARS AGO FOR EMPLOYMENT AND MY UNDERSTANDING- OF HOW IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED. IS THAT THE INITIAL APPLICATION. FOR YOU CAN'T ASK THE QUESTION BUT-LATER ON IN THE PROCESS YOU CAN YOU CAN INQUIRE ONCE THERE'S A CONDITIONAL JOB OFFER MADE SO THAT SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIED HERE TO THE- TO THE THIS CALL IS OBLIGATION PROCESS WHERE THE INITIAL- PIECE WOULD BE PROHIBITED BUT TO BE LATER DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE THE FINAL DECISION. THERE WERE THERE WOULD BE. THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR MY MISSING SOMETHING YES SOMEONE MEMBER MCCARTY AND I'LL CHRIS ON THE LINE TO PROVIDE ANY DETAIL BUT BASICALLY THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IS A SIMILAR PROCESS AND THAT- THE POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS TO WHICH THIS PROVISION IS APPLICABLES WHEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER SAID DISCUSSION THAT'S NOT EVERY SINGLE INSTITUTION THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS BUT TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS WERE IT IS APPLICABLES COULD BE BY OUR TACTIC GENERATION FOR ADMISSIONS DECISIONS OUT THAT YES OR NO ON THE ADMISSIONS- CANNOT CONSIDER- SOMEONE'S CRIMINAL BACKGROUND HISTORY HOWEVER BEFORE THAT INDIVIDUAL IS ABLE TO ENROLL. YOU SHOULD IF IT WERE. CAN'T BETTER THAT HISTORY BEFORE MAKING AT ACTUALLY. DECISION FOR THE STEW TO BE IN THE SCHOOL- BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS TO PROVIDE ANY OTHER DETAILS. YEAH I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT TO DURING THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT QUESTION OR ASK FOR YOU TO LIKE THAT INFORMATION. BUT PRIOR TO STUDENT IN ROLLING THEY CERTAINLY. I WOULD BE ABLE TO CHAT- AND THEN ALSO I NEED TO DO SHE WOULD NOT BE PROHIBITED FROM VERY CLEARLY AND ALL OF THEIR- OUTREACH MATERIALS TO STUDENTS AND IN ADMISSIONS MATERIALS TO STUDENTS. WOULD BE ABLE TO OUTLINE. YOU'VE GOT A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW LIKE THE TO REQUIREMENTS THINGS THE DISTRICT MUST- BE ABLE TO OR MUST BE AWARE OF. OR MADE AWARE OF BIGGER WILL. ASK DURING. THANK YOU. SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO WITH OUR AND EMPLOYMENT BOXING THE CRATES A SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO WEED OUT INDIVIDUALS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL IF SOMEONE APPLIES WITH MINOR DRUG OFFENSE OR D. Y. AT THE AT THE OUTSET AND THEN MAYBE THERE WASN'T THE KIND OF PRIVATE FIRST PLACE BUT IF THEY HAVE. SERIOUS OFFENSE LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR THE WAR SOME TYPE THAT YOU KNOW SERIOUS BATTERY- LATER BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY DO THE ENROLLMENT YOU WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCLUDE THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS IT IS THAT THE RATIONALE. FOR THE SOLE POLICY. IT TOO TO NOT- PUSH AWAY INDIVIDUALS WITH MAYBE MINOR. INFRACTIONS WHEN THEY LOOK TO. APPLY FOR SUCH PROGRAMS. YES GENERALLY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY AT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THIS IS PART OF A BROADER SHIFT I THINK WE ARE SEEING IN THE CONVERSATION IN THIS AREA- THAT PART OF REHABILITATION- IS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE PASSED INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ONE ELEVEN BETTER LIVES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO- WITHOUT BEING- DISPROPORTIONATELY TREATED BASED ON SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST SO AS YOU NOTED- THIS DOESN'T BAR THE CONSIDERATION OF BACKING ATION BUT- WE HOPE THAT IT ENCOURAGES INSTITUTIONS- TO FOR ABOUT. REST OF A PERSON'S RECORD- BEFORE INCLUDING THAT OTHER ACT FROM THE BACKGROUND BUT HERE SHE MAY HAVE SO JUST TO MAKE US MORE COMFORTABLE BEFORE THERE'S AN ACTUAL ROLE MEANT IF IT SO I FOUND OUT THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO DIDN'T ANSWER YET L. CATION CODE IS NOT. HAS THAT HIS OF SERIOUS TO MASS VIOLENCE ASSAULT AND BATTERY WOULD HAVE YOU. THAT'S THE TIME WHERE THE INSTITUTION WOULD WOULD MOST LIKELY. DID DENY THE INDIVIDUAL FROM FROM PROCEEDING WITH THE- EDUCATION PROGRAM SEKARANG. THEY WOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION TED TO MAKE A DECISION THERE YEAH WELL IS THAT THE INTENT THAT YOU WOULD BE THAT THERE WOULD BE- THAT WE WOULD WAIT OUT IN THE INSTITUTIONS OF WEED OUT INDIVIDUALS. CANCERS THAT TIME. I SAID THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE CASES WHERE THIS IS APPLYING TO PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS- I DON'T THINK THE STATE IS IN A POSITION TO DETERMINE- WHICH- WHICH PARTS OF A PERSON'S CRIMINAL HISTORY SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED. VERSUS NOT AT YOU EVEN THAT YOU CAN SEE VERY SCENARIOS IT'S ALL BASED ON CONTACT- BUT TO YOUR POINT THAT INSTITUTION WOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR ITSELF IN MAKING THE WRONG DECISION. WHICH FACTORS- TO WHITE. SO THIS IS FOR ALL I'M I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED NO THIS IS NOT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS IT'S FOR. ALL HIGHER EDUCATION ENROLLMENT I SHOULD CLARIFY NAMED CHRIS CAN WEIGH IN A IT APPLIES TO A NUMBER OF POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS- BUT WITH EXCEPTIONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING THERE ALSO EXCEPTIONS RELATED TO PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS SUCH AS IN A LAW SCHOOL THESE ARE GOVERNED BY THEIR OWN SET OF STANDARDS AND THEYHAVE OWN GUIDELINES BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS TO DESCRIBE THAT THE DIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS. BUT CERTAINLY IF YOU DON'T APPLY TO ALL OF THE STATE. INSTITUTIONS WHETHER THEY'RE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WITH UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS SPECIFICALLY. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. A LARGELY DO NOT AFFECT QUESTION ON THEIR ADMISSIONS APPLICATIONS TODAY. SO THERE THERE IS NO IMPACT ON THAT SIDE OF THE EQUATION. FOR UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS I THINK THAT THE THIRD STILL USE OF A COMMON APPLICATION AND MANY PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THAT DON'T HAVE THAT QUESTION ON THAT- IN BOTH INSTITUTIONS WOULD HAVE ONE YEAR TO. ALTER THEIR PROCESS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO NOT CONSIDER THAT AS PART OF THE NATION'S BUT CERTAINLY THEY CAN DO THAT AS PART OF ENROLLMENT. BUT THE SORT OF LARGER- DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HEARD. IS MOST OF THE INSTITUTIONS ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTERING A PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH THEY CAN'T OBTAIN LICENSE FOR AT THE END- AND I THINK ON THE FRONT AND SORT OF THE RATIONALE THAT WE'VE HEARD. YES IT IS- LIMITING A CYCLE COMPARE YOUR TO STUDENTS WHO ARE IN THAT SITUATION THEY BEGIN A CAJUN TO. SEEK ADMITTANCE TO AN INSTITUTION- BUT THEY THEY STOP. A PAST THAT QUESTION AND THEY FAILED TO COMPLETE THEIR APPLICATION- FOR CONSIDERATION TO THE INSTITUTION I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS LANGUAGE IS FOCUSED ON THE- SHORTER MOVE MATT BEAR KIRK ON THE FRONT END OF APPLYING BUT STILL UNABLE. TO JUSHIN TO MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHO BE ABLE TO. IN ANY PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS ARE CONTROL. THE GIVEN WITH HER FOR ONCE THE IGNITION. A BEEN MADE. AND ALSO OUR INSTITUTIONS WERE BE ABLE TO CHECKS FOR THINGS LIKE. HOUSING AND ON IT SERVE ONE TAKES STUDENT. HAS ADMIT FOR THE MOST ARE PER BEACHES. I DO TRACKS AT THE BEGIN TO. DEVELOP ON EDUCATIONAL PLAN WITH EACH STUDENT AS THEY- SAY- YOU KNOW SEEK TO. OUR DRIVE TO WORK FOR THAT PARTICULAR- MAJOR WAR PARTICULAR PROGRAM LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL COURSES SO IT'S REALLY DONE AS PART OF THOSE EDUCATIONAL YOUR PLANS FOR STUDENTS FOR THE MOST PART. THAT THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO CHECKS WOULD. ARE TRADITIONALLY CAR AT MANY OF THE INSTITUTIONS. SO TO CONFIRM TO THAT TO CONFIRM IS NOT. MAINLY FOR YOU SEE THIS IS NOT REALLY AT ALL FOR OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES COMMITTEE COLLEGES SEE IS HERE YOU SEE YOU DON'T ASK THE QUESTION AT ALL BUT FOR MORE OF THE- PRIVATE ATTENSITY THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. WE SHOULD GIVE THEM A GOOD UC AND CSU AND COMMUNICATIVE ANYWAY MUCH CHEAPER- ANOTHER ISSUE- JUST REAL QUICK I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE-THE PAROLE OVER FOR THEM PROPOSAL WHEN IT WAS PROPOSED IN IN MAY- THERE IS SOME LEGISLATIVE CONCERNED THAT- IN CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAD SEX OFFENSES WHETHER THEY'RE THEY'RE REGISTERED TO NINETY IN THE IDOLS OR OR- IN IN THAT- IN THAT VICINITY. THERE IS A THERE IS A FEW CATEGORIES THAT WERE AND THEY WERE NEGLECTED IN THE MAY PROPOSAL AND THOSE ARE SAYING THAT WAS GOING TO BE- TIGHTENED UP IN ADDRESSED. HERE AND I HEARD THAT QUESTION FROM MY- COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE. AND I'M AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DID- DO THAT WHAT WE HAD pLITTLE BIT CONFUSED ON THIS NEW ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY. BY BUT BUT MISTER COOPER HAVE YOU CAN HELP ME HERE. YES WHEN WE TURN IT OVER JACQUELINE CALLUM AND ALSO AIRED EDWARDS ON THE PHONE. AT THE ORIGINAL- PAROLE REFORM PROPOSAL IN THE MAYOR VISION AND- ALLOWED OR- SHORTENED TERM BEEN A DISCHARGE REVIEW PROCESS FOR- PENAL CODE TO NINETY REGISTRANTS- THAT HAD BEEN EXCLUDED- FROM THE FINAL BUDGET AND I HAVE RELATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THAT HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THE TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT- MISTER COOPER NOTED ARE NOW. ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME OTHER. ELEMENT TO THIS TRAILER BILL. YEAH THOSE ARE TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ONCE THAT AGENT ROLE REFORM OKAY I'LL I'LL I'LL PACK BUT TO. MY COLLEAGUE. SO THE PROGRAM THAT MISTER COOPER WAS REFERRING TO IS- MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION PROGRAM- TO THAT THAT SEPARATE PROGRAM THAT'S CREATED TO ALLOW- AT THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE- THE- ADMISSION OF- SOMEONE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR. INTO A DIVERSION PROGRAM WHERE BY THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN PARTICIPATE. WIRED WE BOTH STATION PROGRAMMING AB ON THE SATISFACTORY COMPLETION OF THAT PROGRAMMING- THE COURT CAN DISMISS THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. MISS COOPER THE FULL QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER THIS NOTHING TALKED ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THE DISEASE LOW LEVEL OFFENSES SO AND MIKE WANTED UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS. OVERPOPULATION A LOW LEVEL OFFENSE SOCIAL BATTERY LOW LEVEL OFFENSE. SO WHEN WE WILL MAKE COLLEGE SANTA THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL PROGRAM. NOT ALL THE GUTS AS NOTHING MORE QUESTIONS SO WITH THE VERSION IT CAN BE GRANTED OVER THE OBJECTION OF A DA. AND SO SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH- DO YOU LIVE OBVIOUSLY MULTIPLE DO YOU EYES WITH PRIORS INCLUDING FELONIES- CAN BE DIVERTED HIS AS WELL FOR DIVERSION. PHILLIES MESSICK VIOLENCE WITH THE PRIOR AND WE KNOW DURING THE CALL THE NINETEEN OTHER MISS CAUCUS HE MISSTATED THE NUMBER TO MISTER LOT OF CASES WHEN OF DRAMATICALLY. AND ALSO CHILD pSO THEY CAN BE DIVERTED AND IF THAT INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT WANT TO REVEAL THEIR RECORD THEY DON'T HAVE TO SO LET'S SAY- THESE CRIMES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN THIS. TODAY'S BILL WE'RE GONNA HEAR ONE O'CLOCK. IN THE SEXUAL BATTERY ORAL COPULATION IF THE VERDICT INCOMPLETE DIVERSION AND MIND YOU KNOW THE VERSION. IS CAN BE ANYTHING INCLUDING JUST PICKING UP TRASH ON THE WEEKENDS. NOT SKINNER BECAUSE YOU WENT THROUGH A COURSE OF SEX OFFENDERS COURSE BUT- TAKING UP TRASH ON A WORK PROJECT. SO YOU COMPLETE THAT. YOU GET DIVERTED. YOU APPLY FOR A JOB AS A MASSAGE THERAPIST MAYBE OR A SCHOOL YARD DUTY. THAT IS EXPUNGED FROM RECORD. SO HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION. WRAP THEIR ARMS AROUND THAT ONE. YES THIS IS A NET IN A CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL REHABILITATION EVER BUT WHEN WE SPEAK OUT WHEN WE TURN OVER TO CLICK HERE TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO BE EXAMPLES YOU MUCH. THE FOR THEIR NETWORK SO I THINK- AS I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR. CORRECT ENOUGH SO I THINK- ARE VETO HE IS THAT THE IN THE IN THOSE SORTS OF CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK. THE JUDGE WOULD- NOT OFFER DIVERSION IT AGAIN IT IS UP TO THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION SO BUT YOU THINK I. KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT EXCUSE ME. YOU THINK. NOT CUT IT THAT DOES NOT OKAY THAT'S NOT SEPTIMAL. YOU THINK. IT'S UP TO A JUDGE'S DISCRETION THAT AS A HUMAN BEING YOU'RE DOING WITH THEIR DISCRETION A JUDGE CAN DO ANYTHING AND WE SAW THE BROCK TURNER CASE AND STAND FOR THE STANFORD RATE CASE. JUDGES MAKE MISTAKES. SO I MEAN YOU THINK DOES NOT CUT IT. SO IT A LOT THIS CUTTING SPELLED OUT IN THE LAW WHAT IS ALLOWABLE WAS NOT ALLOWABLE THAT'S NOT OKAY SO I MEAN FOR YOU TELL ME YOU THINK. THAT THAT'S NOT GOOD LAW. NOT A GOOD PRACTICE. WELL I THINK I WOULD JUST SIMPLY SAY THAT IN THIS. IN THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM- THE JUDGE DOES HAVE DISCRETION IN TERMS OF COULD A LOT AND THEY ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE IMPARTIAL OUR BURGERS AND- ACCEPTING WHAT IS IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND SO. SO THE JUDGE AS THOSE ARE. PART OF A NAKED CERTAINLY BLOCK THM NOT TRAIN BUT BUT IF SOMEBODY IF SOMEBODY GETS DIVERSION. AND THEY COULD BE DIFFERENT THAN. THEY DON'T HVE TO REVEAL THEIR% RECORDS SO. IN MY IN MY INCORRECT THAT THEY GO OUT AND BE A YARD DUTY A YARD ONDER TO SCHOOL FOR MASSAGE THERAPIST. AM I INCORRECT IN THAT ASSUMPTION THEN. I DON'T I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION I DON'T HAVE THOSE SORTS OF DETAILS- I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU IN TERMS OF WHAT- SECONDARY PROBE PROHIBITIONS WHAT APPLY. THOSE SORT OF WILL NOT TO VOTE ON HOW. NOT TO VOTE ON THIS AND- A COUPLE HOURS I MEAN IT HERE WE ARE. AND YOU GUYS ARE ATTORNEYS OR WHOEVER YOU GOT TO DEFEND THIS ALREADY. I MEAN THIS IS THE IT IS IT'S A BAD BILL IS AS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR SAID EARLIER. THIS SHOULD EARN A POLICY COMMITTEE NOT A TRAILER BILL. THAT WE DON'T KNOW THESE THINGS THIS THIS IS CRITICAL AND I GOT A KID I'M FOUR DAUGHTERS AND THESE NUMBERS APPEAR HAVE KIDS GRANDKIDS NIECES AND NEPHEWS. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE TRISHA THIS STUFF THROUGH AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE WE'RE- PUBLIC. DOES IT GIVE A- HECK ABOUT CHILD MOLESTERS PEOPLE THAT BEAT THEIR SPOUSES. THAT ARE INVOLVED IN CHILD **** THERE'S ONE ADVOCATING FOR THEM OUT HERE INNATE LET'S WILL HAVE QUE FOR THESE FOLKS THEY DON'T THEY DON'T GET A BREAK. SO THIS IS JUST I'M NOT. THIS IS CRAZY NOW WE'RE THIS IS UP HERE TODAY. AND STAFF FINANCE. DOESN'T KNOW THE DETAILS THE BILL THERE'S LITTLE TO FIND OUT UNACCEPTABLE. GOING TO MISTER FOR. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR- ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE HAS STATED IF THEY HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL FINISHES AND A DIVERSION PROGRAM ARE THE IS THEIR RECORD EXPUNGED. YES THEY COMPLETE THE DIVERSION PROGRAM ANOTHER WHAT THEY GO THROUGH THE REQUIRED WE HAVE PUT IN A PROGRAMS- COMPLETE ALL THE CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE COURT- THE COURT CAN DISMISS THAT UNDERLYING CHARGE. OKAY SO THE SO THE RECORD IS AT THAT POINT CLEARED. YES I BELIEVE DECLARED. SO THE SCENARIO THAT MY COLLEAGUE OUTLINED IS POSSIBLE WHERE IF SOMEONE WERE TO FINISH IT IN EXPLAINS A RECORD THAT THAT WAY IF THEY WERE TO APPLY FOR. ANY ANY JOB AND IN REGARDS TO WEAR THEM THAT. THAT THEY THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE ON THE RECORD. I'M RESEARCHING THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION RIGHT NOW I WILL GET BACK TO YOU VERY SHORTLY WITH AN ANSWER TO SAY THE ABS I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. I AM LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE AT THE MOMENT I CAN GET BACK TO YOU VERY SHORTLY AFTER. OKAY WELL WE WILL WE GET AN ANSWER BY ONE O'CLOCK LEGAL. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THANK YOU. SO WHAT I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS TERM FINANCE ON CAN YOU. DISCUSS THE BAND A BOX PROGRAMS WERE AND HOW IT ENTER WORLDS WITH LAST YEAR'S BUDGET APPROPRIATION FOR PROJECT REBOUND. WHICH WAS A PROGRAM THAT WE FIND IT AT NINE CAL STATE SCHOOLS. LET ME TRY IT YES I TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS FERGUSON TO DISCUSS THAT. I. THINK THE WAY THAT THIS- BANDBOX LANGUAGE COULD ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW WE'D VERY NICELY WITH. A PROJECT REBOUND GET THAT ADDS MORE STUDENTS APPLYING AND FINISH THEIR APPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT BE IN THIS. IN A GIVEN SITUATION AND I CAN SAY A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. THEY WOULD THEN AT THE AT THE EDUCATIONAL MASTER PLANS ARE WORKED OUT BETWEEN EACH STUDENT. AND THEIR COUNSELOR THE COUNCIL WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE STUDENT IS IN THIS SITUATION AND HELP THEM GET. YOU SET PROJECT REBOUND IN THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED BY PROJECT REBOUND- WHICH IS. FOR THE LARGE PART AS WE LEARNED LAST YEAR I'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS COMPLETE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAMS AT THE CSC. THANK YOU. JUST GOING BACK TO THE- PAROLE QUESTION- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THE ELDER PAROLE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE FISCAL PETITIONS REGARDING THE- PAROLE POLICY. IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS. YES. YET AT GOING CALLUM AGAIN- SO THERE'S TWO MAIN COMPONENTS THERE'S THE PAROLE- REFORMS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE MAYOR OF BEIJING AND WHICH SHORTEN TERMS FOR CERTAIN PAROLEES THAT ALLOW FOR AND- AND EARNED DISCHARGE PROCESS FOR THOSE WITHOUT- ANY VIOLATION ON THEIR PAROLE PERIOD- THAT EXPECTED TO SAVE ABOUT TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR GROWING TO SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR- ADVOCATING TDK ARE MUCH MUCH OF THEIR COSTS ARE DRIVEN BY THE POPULATION THAT ARE EITHER IN THE INSTITUTION AND THAT PROVIDING HOUSING TREATMENT OR REHABILITATION YOU ARE SUPERVISING IN THE COMMUNITY SO HERE AS WE- AT SHRINK THE PAROLE. TO ME. UP WITH THAT MùT PEOPLE ARE SO TO BE IN THE YEAR THIS DOES GENERATE I'M QUITE A BIT A GENERAL FUND PAVING. AND THEN THE EXPANSION OF ELDERLY PAROLE- WE EXPECT TO GENERATE- SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THE NET NEIGHBORHOOD OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS POTENTIALLY GOING TO MILLION. IN THE OUT YEARS- AS YOU COMPARE THE COURT THE COST OF THE NATIONAL SUITABILITY HEARINGS VERSUS THOSE RELEASED- BUT AGAIN THAT THAT THE GENERAL FUND SAVING AND AN AREA WHERE. THE PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE A REALLY LOW RECIDIVISM LEVEL. THANK YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU ALSO ADDRESS FOR COST SAVINGS. THROUGH THE MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION POLICY AS WELL. TO OR ANY POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS. THERE ARE NOT WORDS IN TERMS OF THE COST SAVINGS UP WE HAVEN'T SCORED ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY AND THE BUDGET- I THINK THE THERE ARE POTENTIAL. SAVINGS DOWN THE LINE TO THE EXTENT THAT- A LOT OF TIMES WHAT WE SEE IS PEOPLE WHO CYCLE THROUGH MISDEMEANOR OFFENSIVE- AND SOMETIMES LOWER LEVEL OFFENSIVE DO AT SOME POINT TO PROGRESS TO THE POINT WHERE DID YOU COMMIT MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES THEY DON'T GET. REHABILITATIVE SERVICES AND SO- I THINK IF TO THE EXTENT INDIVIDUALS GO INTO THESE PROGRAMS ARE ABLE TO- GET REHABILITATIVE SERVICES AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM THERE COULD BE SOME DOWNSTREAM SAVINGS- IN TERMS OF. FUTURE REDUCTION FUTURE PRESENT COMMITMENTS- BUT THAT IS. SOMEWHAT BACK WHAT IS IT SO WE HAVE AN SCHOOL ANYTHING IN THE BY SHOULD THAT OCCUR IT WOULD GET PICKED PICKED UP AT SEVEN LATER WHEN WE DO OUR ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS- BASED ON THE PRISON POPULATION. OKAY THANK THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE TALKED WEBER. I WANT TO- FIRST WHAT I'M AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT STAFF IS DONE AND I THINK- SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT THESE- PROPOSALS AND UNFORTUNATELY- DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS WE HAD WE HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MUCH DISCUSSION IN THE UNIVERSE OF COMMITTEES ON THESE ISSUES AND SO THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PIECE. I KIND OF UNDERSTAND MOST OF IT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE HAVE BEEN STE RECYCLED THROUGH THE HOUSE AT SOME POINT IN SOME PROXY OR SOME BUILD UP THERE BUT- IT'S UNFORTUNATE NOT HAD ENOUGH NEEDED MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE HEAR IN THIS PACKAGE TO. IT DOESN'T WITH THAT'S BEEN BREACHED BY THE THREE D. SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY- I UNDERSTAND AND THE BOX ANDI THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND I THINK SOMETIMES WE GET CONCERNED BUT THE REALITY IS IT DOES EXIST IN OUR BIG SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE THE UC'S IN THE C. ISSUES DON'T ASK THESE QUESTIONS AND THE N. AS HAVING BEEN A PROFESSOR I'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ACTS OF IS IN CLASSES WORKING ON A GREAT DEGREE. AND I'VE IN CURRENT THEY WILL IMPROVE THE THAT THEY WANTED TO DO BETTER BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO FOR SEE. AND GO THROUGH ALL THAT WORKING HARD WORK IS THERE BECAUSE SOME OF THEM DON'T QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL AID AND ON AND ON AND ON AND SO IT'S BILLION CARDS WHEN. WHEN I THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE. GONNA THE WRONG PATH AND COME BACK AND NOW THEY HAVE TO UNIVERSE. EARNING DEGREES AND SOME OF MY STE. AND NOW. TO A ONCE IN. WERE PROFESSOR AND HAD. A REAL CHALLENGES WHEN THEY WERE EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND A FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON. AND COME BACK AND DECIDE TO GO TO THE IN THE FAMILY THAT ARE GOING TO REBUILD A LIFE. DONE IT. AND OUR REAL CREDIT TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WORK IN. A SOCIAL WORKERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO. IT IS IT IT YOU KNOW I THINK YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT REHABILITATION WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ALL. AND I THINK. ONE OF OUR KIDS WHO'VE BEEN STREAMLINED COME I DON'T FIRST WOULD BE HAPPY. WE HATE TO HAVE THE NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND UNIVERSITY BECAUSE- THEY HAD A PRIOR. BETTER SO ARE YOU KNOW THAT'S IMPORTANT INVESTED AT TO ALWAYS REMEMBER BE. WE SAY WE BELIEVE IN THE ABILITY. AND SOMETIMES UP. WE LOOK AT IT ONE WAY BUT THEN. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND REALITY IN. TERMS OF WHAT WE REALLY GOING. TO HELP YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN GONE ASTRAY. BASICALLY REBUILD THEIR LIVES IS GOING TO TAKE SOME WORK. AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE STORY ASKING TAT. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BUT PEOPLE STILL GET UP. AND STILL REPEAL THE LICENSE I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I THINK IT IS REALLY- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT WE HAVE CONSTANTLY SAID WHAT. BOTH OF THE CYCLE BECAUSE WITH YOU LOOK AT. WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH US AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OVER. NUMBER PRISONS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS. WE KEEP SAYING WE NEED A BETTER WAY TO ASSESS PEOPLE. BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE GIVE. A HARD. TIME THE BILL WILL BE THE ONES WHO NEED A HARD TIME VERSUS. A LOT OF FOLKS WHO COME IN WE GIVE HIM A HARD TIME. AND WE MAKE THEIR LIVES WORSE BECAUSE PRISON IS HARD. SO TALKING ABOUT DIVERSION ROGRAMS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION HALF. IS IMPORTANT OPTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND IS NOT EASY. TO GET TO THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. IT IS NOT EASY TO GET OUT OF A DIVERSION PROGRAM. BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET IN IT YOU ARE CONSTANTLY MONITORED AND SUPPORTED. AND HAS SOLD IF YOU FALL OFF ONE LITTLE BIT YOU'RE OUT. YOU'RE OUT OF THE DIVERSION PROGRAM AND THEN YOU'RE BACK INTO THE REGION WHICH- WHICH OF THE FELONY OR WHATEVER IT WAS. SO IT'S NOT AN EASY THING WHEN YOU TALK TO JUDGES AND- OTHERS THAT IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO DO. AND GIVING JUDGES SOME DISCRETION GIVING IDA SOME DISCRETION TO REALLY MAKE. DECISIONS BASED ON. WHO WE SEE. BEFORE THEM AND WHAT THAT PERSON'S POTENTIAL IS WHAT. PASSES BEEN. BECOME IMPORTANT ACT I KNOW WHEN WE WERE. DOING THINGS. FOR YEARS AGO WHEN WE- AT. OUT OF THINGS THAT WE- IT WOULD TAKE THE BAIT ALL RIGHT. VERSION PROGRAMS THAT INVOLVES AND SOCIAL WORK IN ALL KINDS OF FOLKS MAKE THESE TO. AND IF QUITE INTENSIVE AND EVERYONE DID MAKE IT THROUGH THE DIVERSION PROGRAM YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT BUT THOSE WHO DID BOB YOU KNOW DID SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TERMS OF BUILDING THEIR LIVES AND GO BACK AND HAVING ONLY HNGING OVER HERE. COMING OUT. BUT I ALSO THINK SO THE THINGS ARE COMP. AND NONE OF THEM ARE. GUARANTEE YOU KNOW OUR PRISON SYSTEM IS A CRAP SHOOT YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT AND THEY REALLY REAL BILL THE TABLE TO MAKE THEM WORK AND SO IT'S A CONSTANT EFFORT TO. TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES OF JUST PEOPLE WHO FLIES IN HOW IN THE AND WHAT HUMAN BEINGS DO- AND SO IT'S NONE OF IT IS SECURED AND ABSOLUTE AND WE FOUND THAT MANY OF OUR ABSOLUTE PROGRAM TO ONES THAT DON'T WORK WHEN WE HAVE AN ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF SENSE. THAT A PERSON HAS TO HAVE BEEN ABLE DETERMINES. IT AND WE SEE IT THREE STRIKES OKAY THREE STRIKES AMEND WHAT THE STRATEGY IS YOU GET IT'S NOT A PEOPLE AND YOU GET X. NUMBER OF YEARS AND SO WE GET SOMEOF THESE FOLKS. IN PRISON FOR. THIRTY FOUR. UNDER THIS TERM IS BLOWING UP. AND ALL OF OUR- BECAUSE A THE- OF THE LACK OF SINCE IT'S- WE HAVE. IN THE IN THE IN THE BIG. OF A FIVE. SO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BACK OUT OF THAT ABSOLUTE STUFF. AND GET TO THE POINT WHERE OUR JUDGES AND OUR- AND LAWYERS AND OTHERS HAVE SOME DISCRETION TO MAKE- RATHER THAN JUST BELIEVING THAT YOU HAVE TO GET X. NUMBER OF YEARS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS AND HAVE TO HAVE THAT- THAT. BEEN DOING- TIME FRAME I WOULD GO TO COURT WITH PEOPLE WHO WOULD ALMOST BE IS IF. THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP AND IT WILL GIVE THEM HAVE CALCULATED NEVER. AND THEY- HAD A SYSTEM IN SO MANY YEARS YOU HAVE SO MANY SO. MANY FIND THESE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF YEARS. BASED ON US TRYING TO BE. HARD ON CRIME HARD ON INDIVIDUALS. MAKER EVEN SO WITH THIS ONE. AND WE DON'T SEE ANY FEEL. SAFER THAN WE HAD BEFORE SO. AS WE LOOK AT IS- I WAS SAFE TRY TO LOOK AT THIS DISCRETION HAVE. SOMEBODY SOMETHING. I JUDGES. OF THE BILL SHOW ME TO JUDGE. AND. MAKE SOME. YOUR BILL TO. EVERY NOW THEN LOOK A PERSON SEE THEM LIVE. THAN SOME ELSE ALL. AND THEY PUT SOME OF RESTRAINTS AND SOME. SOME FOCUS ON SO I THINK. YOU KNOW WE HAVE. CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT AND WE CAN THINK OF THE MOST EXTREME CASES. AND WE ALWAYS LOOK AT THOSE WITH THE ALSO SOME CASES THAT ARE NOT THAT EXTREME. THEY NEED SOME DISCRETION WITH THAT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR- FOR STAFFER FINALLY. OF GETTING TO THE POINT WHO WHO WAS SAYING WE REALLY GOING TO CLOSE TO PRISONS. AND THIS IS THE DATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THIS FOR YEARS. AND I'M OPTIMISTIC FROM SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE SEEN THAT THERE WILL BE SOME STANDARDS. BY WHICH WE JUDGE THOSE THOSE PLACES THAT WOULD BE CLOSE. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO FIND OURSELVES- IN A POSITION WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE STANDARDS AND THEN. WE'RE CLOSING YOUR PRISON BUT THAT YOUR PRESENT AND NOBODY CAN TELL YOU WHAT. WAS IT BASED ON. THE NEED WAS A BASED ON HOW MUCH. MAINTENANCE NEED TO HAPPEN WAS IT BASED ON WHAT THE NOT THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE. IN IT. WE'RE WE'RE CORRECT ARE WE REALLY DOING ANY SAVINGS DOES THIS LEAVE. WITH A SYSTEM. STILL IS ABLE TO MEET THESE TEN OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT NEEDS AND ME THAT BECOME IMPORTANT. YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN OKAY. WITH GRAPPLING WITH OBVIOUSLY OF THE VIRUS IN PRISON STILL GONNA HAVE SOME HEARINGS ON THAT. THOSE WHO INTERESTED BECAUSE- WE HAVE BEEN DEMAND. CAN ASK. HI CAN. AND THE HAVE NOTS. HAD A PLAN THAT WAS A- PLAN. AND ALL WE SEEM HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. QUOTE ANOTHER PLACE IN TERMS PLAN WHICH- OUR OUR OF. THE PERSON WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE PRISON AND NOW A GUY WHO HAS THE OVERSIGHT AS WELL AS OUR- INSPECTOR GENERAL AS WELL AS OUR WAR. AS WELL AS I HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN THOSE THINGS AND NOT. FUNCTIONING WELL. TOGETHER AND AT THE RESULT SEE WHAT WE GET. AND SO WE'VE BEEN. CONCERNED ABOUT AND SOME OF YOU HAVE. ISSUES WITH THE BUT WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED AND I'M WE- I DON'T. IS THE ALSO I'M NOT. THAT THEY WILL FALL THAT PROBLEM. WE HAD A CONVERSATION YOU. WITH AND HAVE COME. IN HEARING. BUT I'D SEE OF. IN MY MIND THAT I DON'T SEE THAT THE PAST FOR WHAT WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT SOME DRAMATIC CHANGES. IN WHO'S RUNNING FOR AT THIS POINT. THAT'S NOT A STATEMENT BUT I DON'T THINK STAFF ARE WORKING HARD ON THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SAY NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. ARE THERE IN FORTY TWO A TWO OR A STACK STATE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO AB NINETY. THE SERVICE FROM AT THE- AB NINETY IS THAT TRANSPORTATION TRAILER BILL ALL MENTIONED TWO ITEMS OF NOTE WITH THAT NEVER FIRST IS STATUTORY RELIEF AT FOR LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES- FOR EXAMPLE- SOME OF THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR WAY TOO AT THE CHARGING A FAIR ISN'T FAIR REVENUES OR RIDERSHIP REQUIREMENTS AND THIS BILL BASICALLY MAKE SOME CHANGES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY CODED. IN TERMS OF THE INTERACTION OF THOSE ENTITIES WITH STATE LAW AND STATE PROGRAMS AND THE SECOND IS RELATED TO HIGH SPEED RAIL- THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD DELAY THE RELEASE OF THE BUSINESS PLAN UNTIL DECEMBER FIFTEENTH OF THIS YEAR- AND BECAUSE THAT IS LATER IN THE YEAR AT THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT NEXT SPRING I WOULD NOT BE TAKING PLACE- SO DELAYS THE DEADLINE FOR THE BUSINESS PLAN. THANK YOU MISS FROM. THE US SO ON THAT NOTE SO YOUR JUSTIFICATION FOR ELIMINATING A PROJECT UPDATE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HAS A REAL PRO OF PROGRAM IS THAT. IT WAS YOU'RE GONNA PUSH BACK THE TWENTY TWENTY SO WE DON'T NEED ONE TWENTY ONE. SO LET ME TURN IT OVER MARK AND ROSE ON THE LINE AND HE CAN TALK ABOUT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO ITEMS. THE FINANCE AND SO THAT THE LANGUAGE HERE IS THE CORRELATIVE TO THE HIGH THE BILL BUSINESS PLAN THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DUE OUT OF IT YOU EVERY TWO YEAR AND HIGH SPEED RAIL DID CRITICS ONE NEXT YEAR- IT- CAME OUT THE FLAT THE WORKER SUCH BORING- THAT WE DON'T SIXTY DAYS. NOTES BUT YOU PASSED BY NAY- BUT- OBVIOUSLY A LOT HAPPENED FROM THE BETWEEN THE TIME THAT FOR NOW AND FIND OUT- AND THAT DEADLINE AND SO THIS THISDELAY LANGUAGES ACTUALLY AT THE REQUEST OF THE ASSEMBLY- TO GIVE ME A FORTY MORE TIME- WE HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERYTHING THAT AND THE PLAN- ESPECIALLY AS THEY RELATE. TO THE CALL THE CRISIS. AND SO IT SHOULD COME OUT IN DECEMBER AND THEN- ON THE IDEA TO VEGAS WHEN THE FUNDING PLAN THE BILL WOULD STILL. HAVE THAT NEXT YEAR I PLAYED. THIS SITE OUT TIME HERE BUT I SUCH THAT JUST MAKE SURE. AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS THERE A BUSINESS PLAN OR A REPORT THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE. FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL. SO THANK YOU IN TWENTY TWENTY AT THAT THE PLAN IS TO IT WILL COME OUT BUT IT WILL BE AT THE DECEMBER AND THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- A FUNDING PLAN. WELCOME OUT. A FUNDING PLAN WILL COME OUT. A WINNER WOULD THAT BE. BECAUSE IT IS YOUR ELIMINATING THE REQUEST HERE YOU SO THE HIGH TO OTHERS AND GIVE US A FUNDING PLAN BUT NOT A PROJECT UPDATE. NO SIR THE- EVER LOW THE WAIT SET UP IS THAT WE HAVE A BUSINESS PLAN THE- AFTER CORRELATES WITH FORTY HAVE TO PUT OUT OF THE YEAR. SO THE LANGUAGE HERE DISTILLATE THAT BUSINESS PLAN AND THEN NEXT YEAR THERE WOULD BE A FUNDING PLAN ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. OKAY SO WE ARE GETTING SOMETHING NEXT YEAR. YEAH OKAY SO I GUESS THEN WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF ELIMINATING THEIR THEIR PROJECT UPDATE REPORT WHY WHAT WHY CAN'T WE GET TO REPORTS I MEAN LOOK THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL THINGS ARE CHANGING MONTH BY MONTH THEY'RE THEY'RE EXPANDING ITS NAME AGAIN NOT OF DOLLARS- THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT THERE'S A FEDERAL DEADLINE AND TWENTY TWENTY. AND YEAH THEY COULD BE CALLED BACK I THINK THAT WOULD I WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WE THOUGHT WE NEED MORE OF MORE UPDATE ON- A ON A REGULAR BASIS HIGH SPEED RAIL BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS ALL THOSE TAPPING NOT LESS. OKAY WELL. ONE OF THE THINGS. NOTE THOUGH IT- BUT THE REAL OF FORTY QUOTE. THERE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE UPDATED EXPENDITURE RECORDS- ON WINE ON THE WEBSITE. THEY PUT THEM ON A MONTHLY BASIS- BUT THERE'S- NOT. A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE. BUT CERTAINLY IF ANYBODY IS INTERESTED AND GOING THROUGH AND SEEN. AND UNDERSTAND BETTER EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I THAT INFORMATION IS ALL. AVAILABLE ON THE AFFORD WEBSITE. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AT THE PLANNER FOR PLAN THE OBJECT THEY PROVIDE THEM UPDATE AND THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORTS. KIND OF PULL TOGETHER SOME OF THAT INFORMATION BUT CERTAINLY ALL AVAILABLE THERE. HELLO YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE THAT THE BUSINESS PLAN TWENTY PLAN WITH THIS PLAN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE- THAT A LOT OF THAT IS LOOKING FORWARD AND SAYING OKAY WELL. BASED ON WHERE WE'RE AT. HERE IS. THAT WE SEE THAT PROJECT AT THE END IN THE COMING YEARS. SO THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED IT- THE OUTLOOK LOOKING FORWARD THAT'S AN IMPORTANT REPORT IS IN IT. YES THEY COULD USE IT EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS BUT IF. YOU'RE ELIMINATING THAT REPORT FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M SORRY SO. YEP WHAT IS THE NEXT BILL HERE WOULD JUST THE WAY IT DOES NOT PLAN THAT IS SCHEDULED TO COME OUT WHAT COULD NOT COME UP WITH THAT NAY AND NOW MOVES. NUMBER RIGHT I LOOK I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE DELAYING THE DECEMBER FIFTH YOU'RE DELAYING THE- MAY FIRST TO TWENTY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY BUT- YOU ALSO ARE ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT IF THERE WOULD BE PROVIDED PROJECT UP A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. UP ON OR BEFORE MARCH FIRST. TWENTY ONE. AND THAT IS. IN THAT INFORMATION WILL BE. PROVIDED AS PART OF THE THAT DID NOT PLAN TO SOME EXTENT AND THEN CERTAINLY THAT INFORMATION IS STILL AVAILABLE ON THE FORTY FOOT THAT CAR. OKAY I'M NOT GONNA HAVE GO BACK AND FORTH ON THE ON DATES I'M JUST SAYING THAT IT SEEMS A LITTLE TONE DEAF THAT AT A TIME WHEN THE LEGISLATURE WANTS MORE INFORMATION FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GIVING US LESS. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS PUBLIC COMMENT. IN THAT PEOPLE IN FACT STATE OR THEIR PLEASE LINE UP TO GO HAD. IS IT ON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY WE SUPPORT THE TRANSIT OPERATION PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL AND THINK THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE FOR THEM. THANK YOU ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. REPUBLICAN IN A SACK STATE. THE FIRST SINGLE FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT LET'S GO TO IT AB NINETY TWO. YES AB NINETY TWO IS THATTHE RESOURCES TRAILER BILL- I'LL JUST MENTION TO PROVISIONS FIRST ARE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS REGARDING THE LEAD ACID BATTERY CLEANUP FUND AND THAT SECOND AND WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION OF THIS WITH THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING FOUR OH ONE CERTIFICATION ALLOWING EARLIER CERTIFICATION FOR THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD UNDER CERTAIN SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. ABOUT HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. SINGLE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE. CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTOPHER KELLY ON BEHALF OF THE HUMBLE AND MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES AND WE SUPPORT THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. THE CARD IS GOING TO KEEP MOVING GOING TO AB NINETY THREE. EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE RELATES TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT- DE IT BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT IS BEFORE YOU FOR SERVICE THE EXPANDED EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AS WELL AS THAT WITHIN AT THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT THAT WAS ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU ALSO EXPANDS ELIGIBILITY FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND RELATED YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDITS FOR UNDOCUMENTED FILERS FILING TAX RETURNS IN CALIFORNIA. AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A LEAST ONE CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF SIX. THANK YOU QUESTIONS MR WROTE. MR VISHWANATHAN A WHAT'S THE COST OF EXPANDING THE EITC TO THE THAT UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION. SO IN THIS FIRST YEAR WE ARE PROJECTING ACOSTA SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO OUT OF CURIOSITY WHAT'S THE RATIONALE IN PICKING THIS YEAR TO DO THAT EXPANSION BECAUSE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WORK WITH AN AGONIZING THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS OVER- THAT THEIR PAINFUL CUTS THE REVENUE MATRIX TO PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE AND YET HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING OVER SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ON EXPANSION OF THIS CONTROVERSIAL PROGRAM. YES I'LL MAKE TO ITS I THINK THE FIRST IS THAT- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YOU KNOW WE'VE YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE WHOLE BUDGET YOU CERTAINLY SOMETHING NAY REVISION- VERY CLEAR EYED ABOUT THE FISCAL CHALLENGES WE FACE. AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE PRIORITIES FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION WAS WHEN I CAME TO CORP SAFETY NET. PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT LOW INCOME FAMILIES OR FAMILIES THAT ARE LIVING IN POVERTY OR CLOSE TO THE POVERTY LINE AND OFTEN WORKING FAMILIES WE'RE GONNA TRY TO PRESERVE. SOME OF THOSE BENEFITS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO YOU SEE THIS IN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. NO CHANGES TO MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY NO CHANGES TO CAL WORKS ELIGIBILITY FOR CALPERS GRANTS OR THE SIZE OF THOSE GRANTS. NO CHANGES TO AT THE SIGN THAT SAYS- AND THAT WOULD BE THE REASON WHY THE ADMINISTRATION PRIORITIZED. PRESERVING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO EXPAND STAND- IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CAN I WE KNOW THAT. I ALREADY SEVERAL LET NIGHT OF LEADERS AND THE MINUTE. TO NOT HAVE TO. WITH LANGUAGE. I THINK I MADE THE POINT ITS THE- EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM AT SUBSTANTIAL COST IS DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY A YEAR WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A LARGE DEFICIT IN OUR HAVING TO CUT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT I THINK ALSO HAVE CHAMPIONS IN THE LEGISLATURE. THEY ARE DIRECTLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- FIRST I WANTED TO RECOGNIZE YOUR ADVOCACY MISTER CHAIR IN THE SPACE FOR A LONG TIME FOR THE I. T. C. AND ONE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION FOR MAKING THIS EXPANSION I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT OUR TAXPAYERS PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING AND- STRUGGLING TO PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE AND THIS PANDEMIC. SHOWS US THE ECONOMIC DISTRESS THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH REALLY WANT TO APPRECIATE IF I CAN THE INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA SAYS IT WILL HELP MANY PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY TO MAKE ENDS MEET SPECIFICALLY THOSE WHO HELP YOUNG FAMILIES I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THEY SPEAK ABOUT THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN OUTREACH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT IN FOR BOTH CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC. OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO MAKE SURE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS AS I THINK HE INSTRUMENTALISTS. WITH THAT I JUST WANTED. SHE ATTENDED. SO WITH HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO RECOGNIZE THAT ALL WORKERS ARE TREATED EQUALLY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THIS IS A POSITIVE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU I ALSO WANTED JUST TO ADD MY COMMENTS TO THAT I THINK IT'S- IT THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL PROGRAM AND WALL. I KNOW THAT THAT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE ADDING TO A PARTICULAR PROGRAM. THIS IS A POPULATION THAT AS WE ALL KNOW DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. SO IF THEY ARE FACING HARDSHIP. S. DE THE NET THAT OTHER MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. HOW TO BUILD THEMSELVES TO SO WHILE WE ARE. PRUNING AND CUTTING DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BUDGET. WE HAVE GREATLY EXPANDED THE AMOUNT OF UNEMPLOYMENT. INSURANCE BENEFITS TO PEOPLE TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT OF WORK IN SO THIS PROGRAM- WILL HELP THOSE FAMILIES WHO WERE WORKING THAT IN PARTICULAR HARD WORKING- AND ARE STRUGGLING AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE- WAYS THAT WE COULD TO THEM WITH. PROGRAM I THINK MAKES A SICK CAN AMOUNT OF SENSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD CHAMPION LEGISLATIVELY LAST YEAR I BROUGHT  BROADER PROGRAM WE'RE UNABLE TO GET IT. BUT THE FACT THAT THESE FAMILIES THESE WORKING FAMILIES AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO SENATE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE- WHEN THEY WERE WORKING BUT THEY CAN'T BECAUSE- OF THEIR- DOCUMENTATION STATUS I THINK. THIS PROGRAM MAKES A LOT OF SENSE IT'S A VERY SMALL INVESTMENT CONSIDERING DIFFERENT TO THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'VE SPENT ON UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE- TO REALLY HELP A FEW THESE FAMILIES WHO ARE ARE VERY MUCH STRUGGLING SO. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING ON THAT WITH US AS WELL. SINGLE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ONE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE. AB NINETY THREE. NOT SEEING ANY PUBLIC COMMENT LET'S GO TO AB ONE HUNDRED. AB ONE HUNDRED IS ANOTHER AT STATE GOVERNMENT DALE AND ALL THAT YOU TO PROVISIONS OF DOUBT- THE FIRST IS REGARDING- ELECTION ADMINISTRATION FUNDS AND SO THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW PREVIOUSLY- ALLOCATED FUNDS TO BE USED FOR THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS- AND THEN THE SECOND ITEM OF NOTE AND THIS. IS THE TRANSFER OF THE SEISMIC SAFETY MISSION TO THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL PROVIDE GREATER ON WINE RED IN THE FACE OF THAT TYPE OF DISASTER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON. AB ONE HUNDRED. CASEY NOTHING FROM THE COMMITTEE ANY PUBLIC ON. A PUBLIC COMMENT ON AB ONE HUNDRED. OKAY WHAT'S GOOD AB ONE OF TWO. AB ONE OR TWO REFERS TO THE CAL SAVERS PROGRAM- FORMERLY KNOWN A COUPLE YEARS AGO I SECURE CHOICE AND THIS BILL MAKES OF TECHNICAL CHANGES RELATED TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND TRANSFERS THOSE FROM THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO THE CAL SAVERS BOARD AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AND IT ALSO CLARIFIES THE OPT IN OPT OUT REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS PROGRAM UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. THIS AROUND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE RATIONALE WAS FOR SHIFTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENFORCEMENT FROM THE EDT TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD BECAUSE EDT STILL SEEMS LIKE A NATURAL FIT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE IT'S EMPLOYERS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM. YES I'VE GOT EVELYN SEE SOME THE WIND YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT THIS- YOU KNOW AND HEARD FROM THAT STAKEHOLDERS AND CAL AND THE CAL SAVERS ARE PROGRAMMED AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS MADE THE MOST SENSE FOR THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE PROGRAM BACK. LET ME TURN IT OVER TO EVELYN STAYS ON THE PHONE. YES THIS IS EVELYN. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AS- IT'S OUR BEST A LOT THEN- I BELIEVE- EXPRESSED- DE SB OUT JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT'S CORRECTLY- SO ACCORDING TO CAL SAVERS I DO TO THE CALL THE NINETEEN- PANDEMIC EIGHTIES EXPERIENCING SEVERE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS AS IT CONTENDS WITH LABOR MARKET DISRUPTIONS IN RECORD BREAKING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS. THAT CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND THEREFORE AND EIGHTY HE HAD INDICATED THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE DUTY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. CHURCH SO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE'RE MAKING A STRUCTURAL DECISION THAT'S GOING TO LAST FOR MANY YEARS THIS IS. A TEMPORARY PROBLEM WITH EDT AND I KNOW THAT. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR- INCREASING STAFFING EDH TRYING US ALL THIS WORKLOAD ISSUE FOR THEM BUT I MEAN HOPEFULLY THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE SEVERAL YEARS FROM NOW ON WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE HAVING TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM I WAS JUST. CONCERNED THAT WERE BEING TOO HASTY HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS COMMENTS ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON AB ONE OF. TO AB ONE TO ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY LET'S GO TO AB ONE OH THREE. AB ONE OF THREE REFERS AT TO UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION- AND  WILL GO TO CHANGES AT THE FIRST IS WITH REGARDING- COVERT SPECIFIC UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAMS- THIS BILL SAYS THAT THESE PAYMENTS SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED AGAINST THE EMPLOYERS PRESERVE ACCOUNT- AND THIS BEING TOLD JULY OF NEXT YEAR OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND THEN THE SECOND ITEM OF NOTE. OF RELATES TO TRIGGERS ON CERTAIN BENEFITS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE FAT AT CORONA VIRUS RESPONSE I. GOT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND SO- HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND I'VE GOT DIRECTLY ON HER TEAM ON THE LINE AS WELL WITH REGARD TO YOU I ISSUES. MR WOULD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FIRST LET ME SAY THAT I AM VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE ARE PAYING SOME ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT IS IN DIRE NEED OF ADDRESSING- THE EDT IS GOING TO RECALCULATE THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CONTRIBUTION RATES FOR EVERY EMPLOYER IN THE STATE AND DECEMBER AND IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION THEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE LAYOFFS THAT OCCURRED. AT NO FAULT OF THE BUSINESS BUT AT YOU KNOW AT AT THE REQUEST OF THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO GET NOW AND UP ANY CHARGE AGAINST THESE EMPLOYERS AT THE ACTUALLY ON TIME IT'S GOING TO BE THEY'RE TRYING EMERGE FROM THIS CRISIS AND- THEY'RE GONNA BE STRUGGLING SO BOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT I KNOW A LOT OF UPSET AND- THE PUSH. THIS THE PART OF THE BILL THAT TALKS ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY I FOUND A LITTLE PUZZLING- I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY FOLLOWING EXACTLY HOW MUCH THAT EXPERT THAT- ELIGIBILITY IS BEING EXPANDED AND WHO IS PAYING FOR IT SO COULD YOU DETAIL THAT FORUM FOR US PLEASE. YES TURN IT OVER TO ERICA AND HER TEAM AND THEY CAN TALK ABOUT THAT IN DETAIL. GETTING OUT BRAND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE TRAILER BILL AN ACTUAL BENEFIT WEEK THE TRAILER BILL WOULD ADD AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN WEEKS HOWEVER WHAT WOULD ENACTING NEED LONG CHARGING PROVISIONS WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT. THE ENTIRE TWENTY WEEKS OF THE EXTENDED PROGRAM WOULD BE FEDERALLY FUNDED WITHOUT THESE CHANGES TO THE NON CHARGING PERVADES AND THE STATE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING 50% OF THE COST FOR THE FIRST THIRTEEN WEEKS. AGAIN UNDER THIS TRAILER BILL WITH THE NON CHARGING PROVISIONS. IT'S AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN WEEKS THAT SAID. HE WE COULD BE EARLY FUND AT. OKAY SO I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDER BECAUSE I FOUND THIS OF THE BILL LANGUAGE A LITTLE CONFUSING- IF WE MAKE THIS CHANGE. THE PAYMENT FOR THOSE EXTRA WEEKS OF- UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY WILL BE GOVERNMENT. IF WE ENACTED NON CHARGING PROVISIONS CORRECT. SO THE TITLE TWELVE LOANS THAT WE'VE BEEN FORCED TO TAKE TO SHORE UP THE SOLVENCY OF OUR UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM ARE NOT GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY EXPANDING THAT ELIGIBILITY IS THAT RIGHT. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY WELL THANK YOU I- ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION- ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S- IT'S LAUDABLE THAT WE'RE TAKING ACTION ON MAKING SURE THAT LAYOFFS ARE NOT COUNTING EPIDEMIC RELATED LAYOFFS DON'T COUNT AGAINST EMPLOYERS- CONTRIBUTION RATES ARE WE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THE EMERGENCY SOLVENCY SURCHARGE BECAUSE- GIVEN ALL THESE CLAIMS I'M SURE THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE KICKING AND NEXT YEAR. AND I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING THE TRAILER BILL RELATING TO THAT. WHAT ARE YOUR QUESTIONS OKAY SO ARE WE ARE SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO CARRY OUT. EPIDEMIC RELATED LAYOFFS AGAINST EMPLOYERS- EXPERIENCE RATIO WOULD WE RECALCULATE THEIR RATES FOR NEXT YEAR HOWEVER THE STATE COULD ALSO HAS A PROVISION THAT SAYS. THAT IF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND BECOMES INSOLVENT THERE'S AN EMERGENCY SOLVENCY SURCHARGE THAT'S ADDED SO I'M I'M MY QUESTION IS A WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO. TO SAY TO AN EMPLOYER OKAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHARGE LAYOFFS AGAINST YOUR EXPERIENCE RATE IF WE THEN TURN AROUND AND ALSO IMPOSE AN EMERGENCY SOLVENCY SURCHARGE THAT ESSENTIALLY DOES THE SAME THING. THE MORNING AFTER OBERNOLTE THIS IS ERIC CALLING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND JUST TO CLARIFY ARE YOU THINKING- OF THE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT CáC. THE TO THE THAT WOULD KICK IN- THE REDUCTION IN THE CREDIT. NO I'M TALKING ABOUT. WELL LET ME LOOK IT UP. THIS SECTION NINE SEVENTY SEVEN OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CODE THAT DICTATES HOW THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CONTRIBUTION RATES ARE CALCULATED- SAYS THAT IF THE UNEMPLOYMENT FUND BECOMES INSOLVENT THERE'S AN EMERGENCY SOLVENCY SURCHARGE THAT'S IMPOSED ON EMPLOYERS SO I'M WONDERING- WHAT GOOD IT DOES TO NOT CHARGE THESE LAYOFFS AGAINST THEIR EXPERIENCE RATE. IF WE THEN TURN AROUND AND CHARGE THEM EMERGENCY SOLVENCY SURCHARGE WHEN WE CALCULATE THE RATES FOR NEXT YEAR MISTER ARNOLD THE WE MAY HAVE TO WE HAVE TO VOTE SOON SO WE MADE- IF YOU. CONSIDER WILL LOOK INTO THAT RIGHT NOW MAKE SURE WE HAVE ALL OF OUR FACTS AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU BEFORE THE AFTERNOON THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT THE DOES GOOD WORK ON THE REST OF IT I I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. COURTESY OF A COMMON WITH GOOD A. B. ONE NINETEEN. SO AB ONE NINETEEN REFERS TO- BARGAINING UNITS IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AS ALL OF YOU KNOW- BASED ON THIS BUDGET AGREEMENT THERE ARE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SAVINGS THAT ARE SCORED IN THIS BILL AND WHEREVER POSSIBLE AT IT'S THE GOAL OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND UNDER THIS BUDGET AGREEMENT TO ACHIEVE THOSE SAVINGS AT THE BARGAINING TABLE- SO THIS BILL MAKES CHANGES ALLOWING FOR THE RATIFICATION AT AMMO USE IN ANY ATTACK DEATHS. RELATED TO SEVERAL BARGAINING UNITS AND I'LL JUST READ ABOUT BARGAINING UNITS. 1-346-911-1415 SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE- ANY PARTICULAR INCLUDES A PROVISION- BASED ON AT THE FISCAL YEAR THE NEW FISCAL YEAR JUST BEING A COUPLE DAYS AWAY- THAT THESE AGREEMENTS- WOULD BE RATIFIED- THROUGH THIS BILL ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AS LONG AS IT REFLECTS THE SAVINGS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT IS REFLECTED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT WE KNOW THAT THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT PROVISIONS HERE AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER WINTERS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I ACTUALLY THINK THE MO USER LARGELY SUPPORTABLE THAT WERE PROVING HERE BUT I HAVE SOME- IMPORTANT CONCERNS WITH ONE SECTION OF THIS TRAILER BILL. THE IT SECTION TO GET APPARENTLY DOES THE ADMINISTRATION THE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE ANY ADDITIONAL AMMO USE THAT THEY NEGOTIATE BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE MONTH AS LONG AS THOSE MO USE RESULT IN SAVINGS TO THE STATE DID I READ THAT RIGHT BECAUSE- I DID THAT SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE TO ME. SO THIS IS A VERY TEMPORARY PROVISION GIVEN THAT THE FACT THE END OF THE MONTH IT'S JUST A COUPLE DAYS AWAY AND THAT IF THESE AGREEMENTS ARE FINALIZED AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THERE ARE SEVERAL CONSEQUENCES RELATED TO THAT BASED ON WHAT'S IN THE AGREEMENTS RIGHT NOW BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MARY HALTER MAN ON THE PHONE WHO CAN SPEAK TO THAT QUESTION. MERRY ALTERING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND YET FELT GOOD FOR MAKING UNPRECEDENTED CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE IS THE PROVISION NOT AS ALLOWING TO ITS STREAMLINED RATIFICATION PROCESS FOR ANY AGREEMENT BETTER REACHED BY JUNE THIRTIETH. THE NEXT TUESDAY. I AM ME. AND THAT'S WILL ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO REALIZE THE SAVINGS THAT ARE- BUDGETING CONTROL SECTION THREE POINT NINE- AT THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR. AND IT WILL ALSO ALLOW THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS TO BE IMPLEMENTED FOR THE JULY TWENTY TWENTY PAY PERIOD. I WHICH MAY INCLUDE VARIOUS ITEMS THAT WOULD HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON EMPLOYEES BY AND- THE VARIOUS UNIONS ARE COMING TO AGREEMENTLAST. AND THEIR SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS ON WHAT GREEN CAN BE INCLUDING A STREAMLINED PROCESS THAT. AND SO THEY MUST. CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONTROL SECTION THREE POINT NINE UPDATING BETTER BUDGET. AND ANYTHING THAT COMES IN. AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH THE STARTING ON JULY ONE NEXT WEDNESDAY. WE WILL GO BACK TO THE OLD AND- RATIFICATION A NOTIFICATION. PROCESS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU SAY. RATIFICATION PROCESS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS WITH NO LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND I FIND THAT VERY TROUBLING BECAUSE WE'RE IN SESSION NOW WE CAME BACK. FOR THIS HEARING AND FOR A FOUR SESSION TODAY WE CAN COME BACK AGAIN IF WE NEED TO RATIFY AMMO USED BEFORE THE FIRST OF JULY BUT- TO ME THERE'S- IN MY THINKING THERE'S NO REASON WHY. WE SHOULDN'T EXERCISE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN APPROVING THESE MO USE SO- I REALLY AM- REGRETTING THAT THAT- THAT PROVISION IS IN HERE BECAUSE OTHERWISE I THINK THIS BILL WOULD BE PRETTY UNCONTROVERSIAL. IT THANK YOU ARE JUST QUESTION TO DEPART FINANCE WHAT'S THE AS OF THE WRITING THE BILL WHAT'S THE OVERALL EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SAVINGS IN THE BILL SO THE OVERALL WHEN IT COMES TO BOTH GENERAL FUND AND SPECIAL FUNDS SAVINGS- IT'S A LITTLE UNDER THREE BILLION DOLLARS SO ABOUT TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU. I SEE NO FURTHER COMMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. ON AB ONE NINETEEN ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY GOOD SB NINETY EIGHT. SO SB NINETY EIGHT IS- THE TRAILER BILL RELATED TO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- WHICH IS FOR K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES- AND BE UPDATED GUARANTEE ESTIMATE FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FOR THE COMING YEAR IS THAT SEVENTY POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS I SHOULD NOTE THAT THAT'S THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AMOUNT WITH BUT THE GENERAL FUND AND PROPERTY TAXES IN ADDITION THIS BILL ALLOCATE SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS IN CORONA VIRUS REALLY FIND AS WELL AS OTHER FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS IN THIS TIME OF FISCAL PRESSURE. AND THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES A SUPPLEMENTAL OBLIGATION TO SCHOOLS BEGINNING THE YEAR AFTER TWENTY TWENTY DASH TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON AND IT ALSO INCLUDES VARIOUS PROVISIONS RIGHT RIGHT TO ATTENDANCE AND HOLD HARPER PROVISIONS. DIED ON ITS WAY THERE'S A. TAKE A QUESTIONS. MR WANTED TO. THANK YOU MISTER SO YOU MENTIONED THE SERVE BILLION DOLLARS IN CORONA VIRUS RELIEF FUNDING THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE AT THIS BILL I'M WONDERING WHY THE BILL SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES CHARTER SCHOOLS FROM ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT FUNDING. I SO LET ME TURN IT OVER AT JESSICA HOLMES- CAN SPEAK TO A HOUSE THAT FUNDING IS ALLOCATED. YES THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF TROUBLE OBERNOLTE- SO IN FACT AND THE- NOT A WITH ALL CHARTER SCHOOL FROM AT RISK AT FEDERAL FUNDS HOWEVER DOES IT. NON THE CHARTERS THEN THE REASON BEHIND THAT WAS- THE THUNDER INTENDED TO ADDRESS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH- HAVING TO AND CHANGE GREAT BUT THAT THE WAY THAT THEY DO BUSINESS IN ORDER TO MEET- THE- ISSUE FACED WITH NINETEEN NOT COPY. CHARTER BECAUSE PROVIDE AT LEAST 80% OF THEIR INSTRUCTION OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM- WERE LARGELY AS NOT AT THAT HEAVILY IMPACTED BY BECAUSE THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC- AND SO GIVEN THAT- WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED THEM AND AS- INTO THESE FUNDS. I THANK YOU IN THIS REGARD. YEAH THANK YOU. OVERALL THIS- EDUCATION- PIECE OF THE BUDGET. HIS IS A GOOD BALANCE IT PRETTY MUCH IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAD PUT FORWARD A FEW. WEEKS AGO WITH OUR BUDGET SO GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FOR THE MOST PART IN COVEN NINETEEN. OUR KIDS AND FRANKLY HELPS US REAL PUT OUR ECONOMY ESPECIALLY WITH THE INVESTMENTS IN CHILD CARE. I THERE ARE THREE OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT WE'RE GETTING LOTS OF QUESTIONS ON FROM. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND LEGISLATORS. IN IN- THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE CELLS HOPING THAT FINANCE COULD HELP MUST ADDRESS THEM TODAY ONE IS THE DISTANCE LEARNING- TO IS THIS THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS AND EIGHTY A IN THREE IS LAYOFFS SO MAYBE WE CAN START. AT THE TOP WITH DISTANCE LEARNING- I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF CONFUSION. ON ON DISTANCE LEARNING SOME CONFUSION FROM C-SPAN ACTS THE LAST COUPLE DAYS AS FAR AS- THE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR DISTRICTS TO HAVE IN IN IN SIGHT- SCHOOL BASED LEARNING VERSES- DISTANCE LEARNING BASED UPON WHAT ORDERS ARE GIVEN FROM THEIR LOCAL. HEALTH OFFICIALS SO CAN YOU HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONFUSION THERE ON WHAT THE ACTUAL LAW STATES WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE. YES JESSICA HOLMES CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK TO ALL THREE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED. THANK YOU YES REPARTEE SO- ON THE FIRST ISSUE OF DISTANCE LEARNING WEEKS HAVE HEARD ON CONFUSION FROM THE FIELD- REGARDING HOW TO INTERPRET THAT STATUTE AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF AND THE STAFF OF THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT- WE ARE ALL PROVIDING THE SAME GUIDANCE- IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH- FOLKS IN THE FIELD BUT- BEYOND THAT WE ARE ALSO ALL WORKING ON. A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARITY AROUND THE INTENT OF THAT LANGUAGE THE TYPICALLY WHAT WE ALL DISCUSSED IN WHAT THE AGREEMENT WAS WITH THAT IN TERMS OF THE LAND THROUGH WHICH SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND AT CHARTER SCHOOL THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION- LOOK THROUGH IN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAM. EIGHT YOU SHOULD BE I THINK THAT SHOULD BE. TO REALLY. THAN MINE FIRST BEING THE RIGHT OF REASONS THE PRIORITY SHOULD ALWAYS BE UP OR IN CLASS. WE KNOW THAT. FOR OUR POPULATION THAT WHO ARE YOU KNOW LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNER HIS DISABILITY FOR THE FOR THE CHILDREN ESPECIALLY IN CRACKING INSTRUCTION REALLY HAS- THE BEST- OUTCOMES FOR THEM THE SECOND THING THAT WE WANT FOLKS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE TYPE PROGRAM THEY'RE GOING TO OFFER THAT YOU TO DO IT WOULD HELP ME SAFETY- INFORMAL BUT THEY NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT IS THE STATE AT ALL GOT. IT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHAT IS THEIR LOCAL I'M COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS GUIDANCE- FOR ENSURING SAFETY IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF COURSE PUBLIC SAFETY IS FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR ALL OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ON THE ALL OF THAT. SOME QUESTION WHETHER. CAN OFFER A HYPER OR A DIFFERENT BURNING PRO YOU KNOW WITHOUT- THE BEACON TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DOCTOR CERTAINLY THEY DON'T NEED TO GET PERMISSION OR APPROVAL IN ORDER TO DO THAT BUT THEY DO NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE HEALTH AND SAFETY HOW THEY CAN IMPLEMENT THAT GIVEN- THAT THE PHILIPPINES AND STAFFAND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY CURRENTLY HOT. SO HOPEFULLY THAT. THIRTY BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER YOU MAY HAVE YEAH I THINK THAT HELPFUL I WAS GOING TO. SUGGEST THAT EITHER THAT CLEAN UP LEGISLATION BUT IF YOU THINK LOWER THE JOURNAL WOULD SUFFICE THAT THE INTENT OF THAT. I THINK THAT IS- THAT THAT SAID- A PATH AS WELL. HE HE DIDN'T ASK THE ONE OTHER QUESTION THAT THAT- HAS BEEN NOW SAYS. WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON WHAT TO DO DURING KOBE NINETEEN- SOME PARENTS MAY WANT TO KEEP THEIR KIDS AT HOME. AND SO THERE IS A RISK ALSO. QUESTIONS AS FAR AS WHETHER THAT WOULD- PROHIBIT SCHOOLS FROM OFFERING FOR FROM OFFERING. OR PROVIDING SOLELY DISTANCE LEARNING FOR PARENTS WHO WANT TO KEEP THEIR THEIR STUDENTS ATHOME DURING THE- CALL THE NINETEEN ERA. YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I THINK THAT OUR- FIRST PRIORITY REALLY IS- TO ENSURE THAT- EVERY CHILD IS GIVEN THE OPTION TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT. HEALTH AND SAFETY PERMITTED TO HAVE BEEN IN CLASSROOMS- EXPERIENCE- THAT THAT CERTAINLY THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY- YOU KNOW I. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO GUESS WHAT- CODED NINETEEN IS GOING TO DO THROUGHOUT THE NEXT YOU KNOW YEARS THE TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE. YOU KNOW% A WONDERFUL OUTCOME WORKABLE NINETEEN BECOMES NO LONGER AN ISSUE FOR US- IT'S CERTAINLY THE INTENT OF THE STATE WE GO BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL IN CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION- AND THAT IS. OUR GOAL- FOR SCHOOL TO THAT ONE OFFER OPTIONS FOR PARENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHO ORDER TO ALIGN WITH SOCIAL THE REQUIREMENT THEY DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES- TO. TO A COP PERSONAL BUSINESS AND THEY'RE OFFERING PARENTS THREE CHOICES THE FIRST WOULD BE A FULL CLASSROOM- INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL THANK YOU HI IN THE WOULD BE. LEARNING ONLY AND THROUGH THAT BECAUSE THEY'VE COME OUT READ TO THEIR PARENTS THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO HELP DOWN LOW. DOWN THERE ON THAT. TO COMPLY WITH HEALTHY SAFETY SO I IF THE QUESTION IS CAN THIS PROVIDE A DISAPPOINTING ONLY PRO THAT THEIR PARENTS PREFERENCE IS I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT CONTEMPLATE BY THE LAKE HOWEVER TO THE X. THAT THAT THERE ARE- PROGRAMS BEING PUT IN PLACE ON HELP INSURE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OPT INTO THE PROGRAM AND THAT IS CERTAINLY I THINK. DO THAT PROVIDES CLARITY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OKAY THANK YOU. THE SECOND ISSUE IS RELATED TO EIGHTY A AND HOLD HARMLESS AND SO I UNDERSTAND THAT'S% CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SPECIALLY AT SCHOOLS HAVE KIDS NOT SHOWING UP FOR WHATEVER RIGHTY REASONS AND WE DON'T. WANT TO HAVE THEM BE- FINANCE AND STABLE BECAUSE OF THAT SO CONTINUE WHAT WE DID THIS PAST SPRING. IN KEEPING SCHOOL FUNDING- STABLE WITH THAT. AND OF OUR STANDING IS HOW WE CAME UP WITH THIS COMPROMISE ON PROP ANY FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. IS WE LOCK IN THE RATE OF LAST YEAR WITH THE ADDITIONAL- FOR PEOPLE EIGHTY EIGHT- AMOUNTS- NOT FOCUSING ON THE ACTUAL HEAD COUNT. SO THERE'S BEEN- A FEW SCHOOL DISTRICTS- COUPLE HERE LOCALLY THAT I'VE ASKED ABOUT HOW THAT RELATES TO THE TO GROWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS. DISTRICTS THAT HAVE- POPULATION GROWTH SO- WHAT IS OUR ANSWER TO THEM AS FAR AS HOW THEY BE ABLE TO SURVIVE. DURING THIS NEXT- BUDGET YEAR. YES WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT QUESTION UNTIL WHEN WE WERE MAKING THE DECISION AROUND EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE BUDGET AND DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY REDUCTION TWO LPS FAST- TO SPEND FELT THAT THE COLD FOR WHEN YOU'RE BUT IT KEEPS THE RATES LARGELY AT NINETEEN TWENTY LEVEL- AND DOES NOT INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS TO ANY CATEGORICAL THERE'S LOTS OF THOSE ARE HUGE. HUGE MAINTENANCE AS OF FUNDING FOR SCHOOL- THAT WE THOUGHT WERE REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE AN EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS- THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WE KNOW THAT IN- IN IN ANY NORMAL YEAR WE WOULD BE IN A DECLINING ENROLLMENT ENVIRONMENT- STATEWIDE. AND ACOSTA LPS THAT- REFLECT THAT THAT ONGOING DECLINE HOWEVER WITHIN EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS WE ARE AS YOU MENTIONED- OPENING THE ADA FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH WHAT IT WAS NINETEEN TWENTY LIKELY TO BE HIGHER- AND- CREATE THIS. HOT YOU WERE. WE WERE AT THE WHOLE HEART THE QUESTION IS REALLY DOING NOT IMPLEMENT EIGHTY HARMLESS AND THE THAT HAVE. WILL BE A TO BE FOR GROW. AND THOSE THAT HAVE DECLINE WILL WILL SIMPLY BE FUNDED AT A LOWER LEVEL. OR TO BE FUN AND EIGHTY HOLD HARMLESS AND MAY BE- SCHOOL DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE GROWTH THEY WOULD OTHERWISE IT'S DEAN. BUT ALSO THOSE WHO WERE OTHERWISE DECLINING BUT NOT EXPERIENCE THOSE REDUCTIONS- AND EIGHTY A AND GIVEN THE VOLATILITY- IN IN ATTENDANCE- AND THEN ALSO- AS THE BE A BREAK EVEN THOUGHT. ABOUT FOR THE TENANT THAT COVERED NINETEEN CREATE- AND GET AND ALSO GIVEN THE- FISCAL SITUATION OF SCHOOL DISTRICT VETERAN DECLINING ENROLLMENT. WHICH TEND TO BE- YOU KNOW LESS AND LESS HOT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE LESS PREPARED FOR- I RESPECT. THAN THOSE WHO ARE NOW AND IT HAS A GROWING ENROLLMENT SITUATION- WE CLOSE TO GO WITH EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS. RECOGNIZING THAT YES. YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOL THAT ARE GROWING- WILL NOT BE THE ADDITIONAL FOR. A SEAT AT THE FACT THAT THAT. YOU KNOW REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROTECT. AND PROVIDE. A LEVEL. WELL DISTRICTS. AND ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE PRONE TO FISCAL TO. HAS THE GREATEST ABILITY BY. ALL RIGHT I THINK THERE ARE STILL SOME DISTRICTS THAT WILL HAVE- QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BUT I REALIZE THAT IT WAS THE- THAT THE SOLUTION TO HELP- THE MOST AMOUNT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNI SO I UNDERSTAND THAT. LAST ISSUES RELATED TO- LAYOFFS AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT- RESOURCES THIS BUDGET. FEDERAL FUNDING AND POTENTIALLY DEFERRALS. MAKE SURE. SCHOOL THANK OVER THE LAST YEAR SO THE LAYOFFS IS ISN'T THAT- CONCERNING BECAUSE THERE SHOULDN'T THERE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE- THE NEED- EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE POTENTIAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONE OF WHICH IS MY HOME DISTRICT RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE THEY HAVE OTHER FINANCIAL PROBLEMS THAT ARE- MULTI YEARS IN THE MAKING AND SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THOSE FEW SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THAT FAKE AT PROCESS AND- OF HAVE YOUR FINANCIAL. US AND THEY WERE POTENTIALLY GONNA BE LOOKING AT. JUST TO DEAL WITH THEIR- BUDGET SITUATION- NOT EVEN CONSIDERING THAT THAT THE CUPBOARD SITUATION- WHAT DO WE SAY TO THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND- TO BE QUITE HONESTWITH YOU- I HAD NOT THAT DOWN WITH MY TEAM AND DISCUSS SPECIFICALLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AT YOU KNOW IN FACT THAT HE'S- CASE AND SO IF IT IF IT'S ALL RIGHT AND I CAN DO THIS IN THE NEXT YOU KNOW. THIRTY FIVE AVERAGE BACK WITH MY TEAM AND- GET AN ANSWER ON THAT QUESTION FOR YOU- AN EMAIL TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF I'M I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT. YEAH I DON'T THINK IT'S- JUST THE SEX CITY THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS THROUGHOUT- CALIFORNIA. WHO HAVE THE SAME QUESTION SO. BUT YES PLEASE GET BACK BEFORE ONE THIRTY THANK YOU. OKAY BUT WERE YES- OBVIOUSLY AYE AYE YEAH I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR OF THOSE WHO WORK SO HARD ON THIS BUDGET BECAUSE I'M OF THE FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US SO WHEN I THANK YOU FOR THAT THERE IS SOMETHING AS POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUE THERE'S GREAT CONCERN ABOUT WHAT WE DOING WITH ABA AND I'VE HAD MY OFFICE IS BEEN. WITH CALLS AS WELL AS TO MY- PERSONAL LINES HAVE BEEN FLOODED WITH CALLS. BECAUSE WE ARE TRULY IT DEVIATING FROM OUR NORMAL PRACTICE OF FUNDING STUDENTS AND LEADING THE MONEY BOTTLE. THE CHILDREN WHERE THEY'RE GOING AND SO. THERE ARE SOME ALL SUCCESSFUL SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL DOING. THE PANDEMIC WHOEVER TRACK TO THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND NOW. ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY DOLLARS TO GIVEN TO THOSE STUDENTS AND- SO WHICH MAKES IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT. FOR THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR OPERATION- SOME IN SACRAMENTO SOME UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND SO. THE WORD IS THAT AND SAYS TRULY A DEVIATION FROM IT. THE WORD IS THAT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME EFFORT IN OF. AUGUST TO TRY TO. DO SOMETHING TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM IS THAT IT. KATE WHEN I OF A LOT. CHOOSE THE DOT. WHAT THEM AND THEN WHEN I HAVE OTHER SCHOOL THAT DON'T A KID WILL HAVE WAR RE THEN WE WOULD THINK THEY WOULD HAVE IN ORDER TO KEEP THOSE SCHOOLS HOPE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES HAVE WE YEAH WE ARE WE PLANNING CONTINGENCY PLAN BASED ON ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE COMING THROUGH- TO HELP THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE STRUGGLING AND THAT I'VE ALREADY MADE DECISIONS THIS ALL TIMES DUKE SO. QUICKLY IN SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE RECRUITING STUDENTS THEY'VE ALREADY AHA BOB MADE DECISIONS ABOUT OF STAFFING THAT THEY NEED THE CLASSROOM SIZES THEY MAY EVEN ENROLL STUDENTS AND WE'RE JUST A PROBABLY A MONTH OR SO AWAY FROM WHEN MANY OF THEM OPEN AND NOW THEY'RE BEING TOLD THAT THOSE STUDENTS WILL BE FUNDED WHAT HAVE WE ARE WE PLANNING AND WITH MANY OTHER PLAN IN PLACE TO BASICALLY RESPOND TO THIS RATHER THAN THE WHOLE CAR RULE WHICH- ARE SOUNDS GOOD ON THE SURFACE BUT REALLY DOES NOT- ADEQUATE. TWENTY I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BUT NOT. THE KIDS. E HAVE ANY OTHER PLAN THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE KEEP SAYING THAT THEY THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. ARE WE PLANNING ANYTHING ELSE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM ARE WE GOING TO LET THESE FOLKS SUFFER. FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR WITHOUT THE RESOURCES. I MEAN JESSICA SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE AS WELL. I THINK WE AFTER ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER AND SO CURRENTLY THE BUDGET DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THOSE ENTITIES HOWEVER AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE HAPPENING CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS ISSUE- SO I A I KNOW THAT IT IS. A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION- I CAN'T NECESSARILY COMMENT ON ON WHERE IT'S HEADED AT THIS TIME- BUT I KNOW THAT IT DID IT IS SOMETHING THAT- HAD BEEN AND THE IT'S BEEN ON THE GOVERNOR'S MIND- AS WELL AS- YES WE'VE HEARD FROM LEGISLATIVE. CAN WELL THERE IS SOMETHING COMING BACK BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO THINK OF THOSE ESPECIALLY SOME SCHOOLS THAT HAVE HAD REAL INCREASES IN A MOMENT OF NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT THEY HAVE FOR THE COMING YEAR AND THAT WOULD BE MOST UNFORTUNATE- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- LEARNING LOSS AND I KNOW THERE WERE- BILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT FOUR FIVE BILLION A CAME IN FROM THE FANS TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF LEARNING LOS. YEAH IS THAT MONEY JUST FOLDED INTO THE ACT ALLOCATION ARE WE REALLY LOOKING AT. THOSE GROUPS WHERE THERE HAS REALLY TRULY BRAND SOME LEARNING LOSS- MY UNDERSTANDING. OF FROM OF THE DEPARTMENT. OF THE CD THAT. THERE ARE POCKETS OF STUDENTS AT LIKE TWENTY THIRTY PERCENT. OF IN SOME SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES WHERE THE KIDS HAVE NEVER EVEN TURNED. THEIR ALL THEIR THEIR A DISTANCE LEARNING MATERIAL SO THAT THERE ARE. FOLKS WHO WOULD NOT EVEN ACCOUNT FOR THAT WE HAVE NOT GONE TO FIND AND TO. SEE WHERE THEY ARE AND WHY THE ART OF ROLLED IN SOME KIND OF. DISTANCE LEARNING ACTIVITY AND MOSTLY THOSE KIDS ARE AT THE BOTTOM AND SOME OF THE INNER CITY SCHOOLS SO. IS MONEY TARGETED TOWARD BETTER HAVE WE JUST. INTO THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE WE- BELIEVE WE HAVE A CRISISA WE HAVE A CRISIS AND AS A RESULT. WE JUST OF GIVING UP THE MONEY BASED ON EIGHTY EIGHT THE- THE- I THINK ITS FIBER. OF FIVE OR SIX BILLION I CAME IN FOR SUPPOSEDLY LEARNING LOSS FROM FITS. YES I'LL MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS AND- JESSICA COULD PROVIDE MORE DETAILS WELL- FIRST- SO. THEY WERE VERY SOURCES OF FEDERAL FUNDING- THAT WERE PROVIDED FOR EDUCATION BUT I THINK. WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SPECIFIC. EVER IS THEY PROVIDED OVERALL NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE IN FLEXIBLE FUNDING SO THAT COULD BE USED FOR. A VARIETY OF PURPOSES ACROSS IT. AS AS LONG AS IT'S IN RESPONSE TO COPE IN NINETEEN IMPACT. AND SAID GROUP. BEFORE I TAKES FOR. FOUR BILLION OF THAT SOME NEARLY HALF OF THE OVERALL FLEXIBLE SUNDAY- FROM THE CROWD OF OURS WE FIND A DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY. TO LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION BASED ON THE IMPACT THAT WE'VE SEEN AND THEN YOUR SECOND QUESTION AIDS AROUND. OUT WHERE ARE THESE FUNDS TARGETED AND THEY ARE NOT SIMPLY BUT IN GENERAL. I'LL SEE AT THAT TIME THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED- TO THE STUDENTS MOST IN NEED THAT WAS A MESS AND- THAT THEY- ARE MADE TO IN THE MAIL. WE DO BELIEVE THAT FINAL AGREEMENT REFLECTS THAT BUT JUST YOU COULD TALK SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDTO CONSTIPATION GRANT FUNDING. AND OTHER FACTORS HOW THAT. WE'RE GOING PURPOSES. CERTAINLY SO. THE THAT NEEDS. THAT HAD AND THAT WE- DON'T. HAVE ANY ON THE ANY. WITHOUT THE ASSET AND OTHER STUDENTS- WHO ARE AT LOWER INCOME WE HAD STUDENTS- WHO ARE. USED IN FOSTER CARE STUDENTS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- AND STUDENTS BETTER ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND SO- OF THAT LARGE PART OF FUNDING THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WILL GO OUT TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES BASED ON. NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES- TO APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT NINE BILLION WILL BE GOING OUT BASED ON SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING- WHICH IS THE PORTION OF LPS. BUT IT'S TARGETED TO I THANK AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE CALM PEOPLE TREATED YOU THEN. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL PRACTICE ONE BILLION. IS GOING TO BE GOING OUT BASED AS TOTAL LPS ALLOCATION SO THERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS ARE BEING TARGETED SPECIFICALLY TOWARD STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE IN A PARKING LOT. AND I GUESS ALL THIS IS ANECDOTAL SO UP SO YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY YOU'RE NOT USING ANY DATA ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON THE GROUND AND OF THE WORD STUDENTS WHO DID NOT GET ANY INSTRUCTION. DURING THIS TIME FRAME ARE WE IF BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LEARNING LOS ONE OF THE GREAT CONCERNS AT THE TIME WAS THAT THIS WOULD HAVE ITS GREATEST IMPACT OFTENTIMES OF ONE. OF NOT NECESSARILY KIDS WITH THE LOW INCOME BUT BASICALLY SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF KIDS OR- OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE AND WE HAVE THE DATA I UNDERSTAND OF THOSE KIDS WHO HAVE NOT. WHO JUST MISSING BASICALLY WOULD NOT OF SIGNED INTO ANY OF THE DISTANCE LEARNING ACTIVITIES BUT JUST MISSING FROM THIS FROM THE SYSTEM AND ITS IT AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO NOT USING ANY OF THAT KIND OF DATA. TO MAKE THE- USER THIS THE DAY WE HAVE. IT WAS. AND SO FORTH AND SO ON WITH REALLY. OF WANTING TO THIS WHOLE OF LE LOS THE KIDS TRULY ARE MISSING IN THE SYSTEM SO WE'RE NOT DOING THAT IS THAT CORRECT. IT WAS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WAS ABLE TO COLLECT ON CONSISTENTLY ON A STATEWIDE BASIS THIS IS A NATION MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT. THERE WERE SOME- INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT PROVIDED SOME OF THE INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HOWEVER TO GET TO THE GOOD I THINK OF WHAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE BUILT IN- SEVERAL ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IN TWO. OF THE- BE BURNING- INDEPENDENT PLAN- LEARNING COMMUTING INTENDED PLAN THAT WILL DISTRICTS AND CURSING COMING UP BUT YOU KEEP WILL BE COMPLETING IN SEPTEMBER. AND AT IN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR- NOT HAVING THAT EIGHTY HOLD HARMLESS THAT WILL DISTRICTS ARE- ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDED AND REDUCED WE HAD REQUIREMENTS IN THERE AROUND STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND WHAT CONSTITUTES. AN ATTENDANT AND ENGAGEMENT AND REQUIREMENTS AROUND- FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT TOO OLD SCHOOLS ARE NOT ABLE TO CONTACT I KNOW THAT WE BEGAN DISTANCE LEARNING- UP AND DOWN THE STATE WE IN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATE DID WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL DESTRUCTIVE I THINK WAS KIND OF STATE COUNTY AND THE INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS WE RENEGOTIATED SOME NEW CONTRACTS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING- WITHOUT- SO THAT UP. IT WAS BASICALLY A CONTRACT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF THE MODEL HOURS IT TO TEACH THAT IT TEACHER HAD THIS BAND WITH- WITH KIDS IN DISTANCE LEARNING OR WITH THE CTIVITIES OF DISTANCE LEARNING IT TALKED ABOUT- NO ONE WOULD FAIL NO ONE WOULD BE HELP. ACCOUNTABLE BASICALLY OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE AND SO FORTH AND SO ON DO THOSE CONTRACTS DEAL ARE THEY STILL BEING USED AS A BASIS WOULD YOU KNOW YEAH THEY STILL USE IT SCHOOLS ARE STILL INVOLVED IN DISTANCE LEARNING. I WOULD NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY LOOSE HAD NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND NO ONE SUPPOSED WAS GOING TO BE HARMED ABOUT STEM. AND ALSO WE KNOW BE BENEFITTED SO DO ARE THOSE COUNTRIES STILL IN PLACE FOR DISTANCE. LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDING. I CAN SPEAK TO ANY KIND. THAT ARE LOCALLY BARGAINS- WHAT I CAN SPEAK TO OUR MOST THE REQUIREMENT THAT FOR SOME OF THE- FLEXIBILITY THAT WERE ALLOWED THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDERS- BY THE GOVERNOR AND- THE THREE SB ONE SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN RESPONSE TO POSTED NINETEEN- SOME OF. THE FLEXIBILITY- THAT WERE ADOPTED IN THOSE MEASURES ARE BEING CONTINUED- BUT THOSE ARE REALLY MOSTLY- AROUND THINGS LIKE THE EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS- THERE ARE A FEW FLEXIBILITY IS AROUND- OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND PROVIDING AN EXTENSION ON. THIS RECORDING REQUIREMENT BUT LARGELY- THE- THE- ALLOWANCES THAT THOSE THOSE VEHICLES PROVIDED ARE EXPIRING- AND IN TERMS OF. SCHOOL PROGRAM. YES WE- RIGHT IN THE TRAILER BILL THAT THERE IS IN THAT QUALITY AND PRO WILL BE CAN IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR- AND THAT YOU KNOW ALL IT WITH THE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ANYTHING CALLED OUT NOT THE ALL OF THEIR LIVES WILL BE CONTINUED AND WILL BE APPLICABLE. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE CONTRACTS ARE EXPIRING DO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY EXPIRE. UNLIKE YOU I THINK THAT I CAN'T SPEAK ANY LOCALLY BARGAIN CONTRACT I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND SB ONE SEVENTEEN- AND THE MAJORITY OF. THE THIS IS THE FLEXIBILITY AND THOSE- WILL NO LONGER B AND- APPLICABLE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE. HI CARLOS MARQUEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION- JUST HERE TO SPEAK TO THE HOLD HARMLESS ISSUE THAT WAS SURFACED IN COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER FOR YOUR COMMENTS AB. THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION- IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF. THE EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION BEING LOCKED IN AT TWENTY NINETEEN. TWENTY LEVELS FOR GROWING CHARTER SCHOOLS I ALREADY MENTIONED DISTRICTS GROWING DISTRICTS WOULD ALSO BE IMPACTED. CHARTERS WILL BE IMPACTED IN TWO KEY WAYS FOR CHARTERS THAT ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR GREAT EXPANSION PER THERE AT LEGALLY BINDING CHARTER. AT THEY WILL CERTAINLY DO HAVE THE DISCRETION NOT TO EXPAND GREATS BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO- INFORM FAMILIES WHO THEY'VE ALREADY AND ROLLED OF THAT DECISION THEY'VE SECURED FACILITIES THEY'VE MADE THE HIRING DECISIONS. THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN LAYOFFS AND THE SECOND OF COURSE IS THAT SOME CHARTERS HAVE YOU SEEN A GROUNDSWELL OF INTEREST DURING THE PANDEMIC HAVING BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY. SOME OF THE OLD DISTANCE LEARNING EXPERIENCES THAT THEY'VE HAD IN TRADITIONAL- PUBLIC SCHOOLS- ALSO JUST WANTED TO- TO MENTION AS WELL THAT- THE ASSOCIATION FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE UNCERTAINTY. IS PERHAPS AS ADD AS POLICY ITSELF- JUMPED OUT TO AN SO MANY GOALS WE CANNOT WAIT UNTIL AUGUST. THIS BUDGET WILL ULTIMATELY DICTATE DECISIONS THEY'RE GOING TO BE MADE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS SELL OUT SOME CERTAINTY BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE ISSUE- WILL BE WORKED ON IN RESULT WOULD CERTAINLY BE WELCOME- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE MEASURES IN SB NINETY EIGHT NEED TO BE PASSED TODAY. WE DON'T OPPOSE THAT- FRAMEWORK MORE BROADLY- BUT WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO DO MORE- AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST MENTION ON THE NâNG NON CLASSROOM BASED ISSUE- JUST A QUICK REVISION. THAT IN FACT IN ORDER TO BE IN OUR CLASSROOM BASED STE ALL IN CALIFORNIA AT YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTION- MORE THAN 20% OF INSTRUCTION. OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM NOT MORE THAN 80% SO YOU DO HAVE NON CLASSROOM BASED OPERATORS THAT ARE FIGHTING NEAR 80% CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION- AND VERY MUCH RELIANT ON- ON RESOURCE CENTERS AND I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S MOST DISQUIETING FOR- CHARTERS AND FAMILIES IN OUR CLASSROOM BEATLES WITH RESOURCE CENTERS IT THAT. SPECIAL PATIENT STUDENTS MOST. ALL OUT REPLY AND THEY REALLY DO REQUIRE THAT FITS ACCESS TO DATE THEY'VE ALSO GONE WITHOUT DURING THIS MXL. I'M TO LET SUGGEST THAT NON CLASSROOM BASED AT SCHOOLS WRIT LARGE- ARE DESERVING OF THAT CARES ACT LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION- IS SIMPLY. NOT WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM OUR FAMILIES. AND VERTEL'S WAS WE ARE STATE AND IS HAPPY EXPERIENCE THE SAME LEARNING LOSS BY. NOT CLASSROOM BASEMENT WINDED LEARNING TAP OUT AND WE'RE THAT. WE. WANT TO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR. ENCOUNTERING A- GOOD MORNING BY IS PAUL- I AM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PACIFIC CHARTER INSTITUTE I'M ALSO SITTING BOARD MEMBERS ARE FAR SECOND A COUNTY BOARD OF- EDUCATION- I'M SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO SB NINETY EIGHT NUMBER THIRTY SIX AND SPECIFICALLY THAT CAP FUNDING- THIS BLUNT INSTRUMENT FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND PENALIZES GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS BY NOT ALLOWING THEM TO ENROLL BECAUSE OF THE CAP AND FUNDING. THIS ALSO THE A HOLD HARMLESS- OFFERS NO INCENTIVE TO FIND THE STUDENTS WHO AREN'T APPEARING IN THE SCHOOLS AND CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE INFORMATION BEING PROVIDED TO US THOSE DISTRICTS IT DID PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT THAT STUDENTS WERE BEING FOUND AND SO WHAT INCENTIVE IS THERE TO FIND THE STUDENTS. HOW CAN WE ACCOMMODATE AT RISK STUDENTS SEEKING BETTER PROGRAMS. IF THE BETTER PROGRAMS CAN'T HAVE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS. HOW MANY AT RISK STUDENTS WERE NEVER CONTACTED IN THE SPRING. HOW MANY MORE AT RISK STUDENTS WILL NOT BE CONTACTED IN THE FALL HOW WE HOLD THIS ACCOUNTABLE. PLEASE TAKE THE CAP OFF PUBLIC SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY ARE. PRICE AND BEST TEACHERS AND SCHOOL THERE TOO LOOKING FOR THE pSCHOOL DISTRICT BUT DRAMATICALLY HARMING STUDENTS. WE'LL BE PUTTING THE BEST THE BEST TEAM ON THE SIDELINES. AND FORCING A FORCING WHAT'S LEFT TO EDUCATE OUR KIDS WE'RE IN A CRISIS AS A ONE OF OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MENTIONED THE CRISIS IS NOT ONE TO TAKE. TAKE A LARGE PART OF A PART OF OUR ORGANIZATION OFF OF THE TABLE THOSE DISTRICTS ARE GROWING SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMENT THE STUDENTS THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE GROWING SHOULD BILL COME TO STUDENTS AND THOSE DISTRICTS. THAT ARE GROWING SHOULD BECOME JUST A HAVE AND FOR THOSE TWO ARE OKAY THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY SEEING NONE LET'S GO TO SB ONE ONE SIX. SB ONE ONE SIX IS THE HIGHER EDUCATION TRAILER BILL ALSO WOULD MENTION THREE PROVISIONS UP THIS BILL I KNOW WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED- THE TRIGGER MECHANISM IN HIGHER EDUCATION FISHING MORE BROADLY IN ITS PLACE IN THE BUDGET- BUT FIRST- THIS CLARIFIES- STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AND FOR CAN CALIFORNI COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AT SOME OF THE SPENDING A DEFERRAL ITEMS THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED A SECOND- THIS BILL INCLUDES PROVISIONS RELATED TO CAL GRANTS AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP BOTH OF WHICH WEREGENERALLY MAINTAINED- IN THIS BUDGET RELATIVE TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT AND THEN THE THIRD IS SOME PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM.
