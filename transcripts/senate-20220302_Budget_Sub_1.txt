SKEWS ME AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WILL GO IN THAT ORDER SO LET ME WELCOME A LIST MIGHT TO THE SUB COMMITTEE. THE MORNING UNLESS MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS DISRUPTED NORMAL EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE PATTERNS IN MANY WAYS AND IMPACTED THE COLLEGE AND CAREER PLANS OF MANY CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AGE FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. RECENT REPORTS HAVE INDICATED THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED MANY ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH GRADERS TO ALTER THEIR POST SECONDARY PLANS FOR REVISED THEIR EMPLOYMENT ASPIRATION. AT THE SAME TIME NUMEROUS SECTORS OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY INCLUDING OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND HEALTH CARE INDUSTRIES HAVE NOTED SHORTAGES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES. TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND THE OFFERING OF SEAMLESS PATHWAYS FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE AND CAREER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PATHWAY PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY IN THE FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY HEALTHCARE EDUCATION AND CLIMATE RELATED FIELDS- AND THEY WOULD BE LISTED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GOLDEN STATE PATHWAYS PROGRAM. THE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO AWARD TWO TYPES OF COMPETITIVE GRANTS ELEAZAR ONE WOULD BE A CONSORTIUM DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNING GRANT TO SUPPORT COLLABORATIVE PLANNING AND THE OTHER WOULD BE AN IMPLEMENTATION GRANT. BONDS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND AS A CONDITION FOR RECEIVING A GRANT. UNDER THIS PROGRAM- LEDS HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND SET ASIDE FUNDING WAS IN ITS OWN BUDGET OR OBTAIN FUNDING COMMITMENTS FROM PROGRAM PARTNERS TO SUSTAIN THE ONGOING OPERATIONAL COSTS. REAL BILL LANGUAGE INCLUDES PROVISIONS TO ALLOW FOR THE CONTRACTING OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS AND PROGRAM EVALUATION IS REQUIRED AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN TO BE COMPLETED BY JUNE THIRTIETH. OF TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I. WILL BE BACK LATER FOR QUESTIONS AND ALL MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL MOVE ON TO MICHAEL R. FERRIS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF THE PUBLIC TO DO SO ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ALL PROPOSALS AN ISSUE ONE. OF WILL FOCUS ARE COMMON THINGS ITEM IN JUST A FEW CLICKS SHE CONCERNS. ALSO REGARDING THE GOLDEN STATE PASSED THIS PROPOSAL OUR FIRST CONCERN IS THAT IT WOULD ADD MORE COMPLEXITY TO THE STATE'S APPROACH THE FUNDING COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. THE PROPOSAL HAS SEVERAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE STATE'S TO EXISTING HIGH SCHOOL CTE PROGRAMS. HOWEVER THE PROGRAM HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. SUCH AS HAVING PATHWAYS TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS OF COURSE REQUIREMENTS. AND REPORTING PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH- INTEGRATED SUPPORT SERVICES. THAT COULD BE BENEFITS TO ENCOURAGING SCHOOLS IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS OF THIS TYPE AS A COMPRISES MOSTLY GREATER OPTIONS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE YOU SCHOOLS OFTEN OPERATING PROGRAMS AT THREE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING AND THREE DIFFERENT PROGRAM RULES. THIS CAN MAKE IMPLEMENTING WILL. WE HAVE THE MINISTRY THE- GONNA REALLY FISCAL TIMES FOR A SCHOOL PROPOSED EXPECTED. FOR THE TYPE OF PATHWAY PROGRAMS THAT RECIPIENTS MUST DEVELOP. AND ALSO REQUIRES A GRANT TO SUBMIT A- SET OF. OUTCOME DATA. ELECT SOME CRITICAL DETAILS AND LEAVES A FEW KEY DECISIONS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. SUCH AS THE FUNDING AMOUNT THAT GRANTEES WILL RECEIVE IN THE ALLOWABLE USES OF THE FUNDS. WITHOUT THESE DETAILS IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS THE PROGRAM'S POTENTIAL BENEFITS. A RELEASE THESE CONCERNS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTED MINISTRATION PRIDE MORE INFORMATION OF THE PROPOSAL PRIOR TO THE REVISION. MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO YOUR AGENDA. FOR THIS SUMMER QUESTIONS IS ON pBOTTOM OF PAGE SIX. OH ONE OTHER CONCERN WE WANT TO RAISE. THE PROPOSAL IS A LITTLE TO TARGET FUNDING TO SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS- BENEFIT THE MALLS. THE MINISTRATION GIVES PRIORITY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH AT LEAST HALF OF THEIR STUDENT POPULATION CONSISTING OF ENGLISH TERMS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AMONG OTHER METRICS- BUT JUST ON THAT ONE METRIC OF THE PROPORTION OF STUDENTS THAT ARE YASSER LOW INCOME. WE FIND THAT AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR PRIORITY. SUCH A BROAD DEFINITION IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON STUDENTS. THAT COULD BENEFIT MOST FROM THE PROGRAM. IF THE- ADOPTS A PROPOSED WE WERE OTHERS STUDENTS WITH HIGHEST. FOR EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER INCREASING THE THRESHOLD FOR PART PRIORITY FOR DISTRICTS WITH 75% OF THEIR STUDENT POPULATION BEING ALL INCOME. FOR INVESTORS STUDENTS. LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO REQUIRE GRANTEES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS EQUITABLY ACROSS VARIOUS WILL FACE IN THE WAY THAT IS TARGETED TO BENEFIT STUDENT SUBGROUPS WITH LOWEST COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. OUTCOMES ON THE COMPUTER COMES ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THEN MOVED TO PICK QALISYA DIRECTOR OF CAREER AND COLLEGE TRANSITION DIVISION OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. MORTGAGOR LEARN OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN MY NAME ST. DIVISION RIGHT OF THE CURRENT CULTURE. VISION HE- TODAY I'M- ON BEHALF THE STATE'S. OF PUBLIC pINSTRUCTION CHUNK BERMAN. CITY IS GRATEFUL FOR THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLEGE OR CAREER PATHWAYS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM LANGUAGE IN THE GOLDEN STATE PATHWAYS HAS MANY SIMILARITIES TO LANGUAGE WITHIN. THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA. PARTNERSHIP ACADEMY PROGRAM. XIAOMI PRO IS VILLAGE ALL FORTY SHOULD GO FORWARD FIVE. IT IS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IS FOCUSED ON INTEGRATED COURSES ACROSS SPECIFIC PROPER PATHWAYS STUDENTS ROLE IN CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES HAVE HIRED. A THREE G. COMPLETION RATE THAN THE STATE AVERAGE AND HIGHER GRADUATION RATE THAN THE STATE AVERAGE WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED OPPORTUNITIES FURTHER DISCUSSES SUSTAINABILITY PLAN. FOR THE GOLD STATE PATHWAYS PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I KNOW THAT AND ONE DAY WE'RE GOING TO DO A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPARISON. OF BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OF FINANCE ON THIS ONE NOW. AND MY QUESTION IS THIS IT IS RECOMMENDED TO BE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION OF ONE NINE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS. THAT WOULD BE SPREAD OVER FIVE YEARS. R. WHY NOT TAKE THE AMOUNT OF THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THAT WOULD BE EXPANDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND TAKE THE OTHER ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS AND MEET SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT WE'VE HAD EXTENSIVE TESTIMONY ABOUT SUCH AS BY DOWN OF PERSONS STIRRERS- OLD OR FACILITIES OR OTHER THINGS THAT SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS WHY WAS IT DECIDED TO TAKE. ONE POINT FOUGHT TO RECOMMEND ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF ONE TIME MONEY OVER FIVE YEARS RATHER THAN JUST WHAT WE NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND USE THE REST OF THE MONEY FOR. FOR PRESSING NEEDS. SURE I'VE CHAIR CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE PART OF PLAIN NOTED STIRS- CALLS AS AS FACILITY CULTURE FUNDED BY GENERAL- AND HOW OF THE BROWSER NINETY- WE ARE LOOK AT THE IN THE AS YOU KNOW BEING CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING OUR OVERALL FRAMEWORK- FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW PREPARING OUR STUDENTS PREPARING THEM FOR. COLLEGE OPPORTUNITIES CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH NEEDS CRITICALLY NEEDED AREAS OF THE STATE BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO HEARD YOU KNOW FROM OUR OUR EDUCATORS OF THEIR STAFFING SHORTAGES FOR TEACHERS FOR OTHER PROFESSIONAL IF I CAN INTERRUPT FOR A SECOND WE'RE NOT ARGUING THAT WERE IN AGREEMENT ON THAT THIS IS A FISCAL QUESTION NOT A- NOT A PROGRAM QUESTION. A. N. DO SEIZED ON THE PER STORES THERE'S OTHERS THAT ARE FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES THAT ACTUALLY FIT THIS THE QUESTION IS WHY TAKE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AND PUT IT OVER FIVE YEARS RATHER THAN JUST THE AMOUNT THAT'S NECESSARY IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND USE AN EXTRA BILLION FOR FACILITIES OR ONE OF THE OTHER NEEDS TO SELL TROUBLE FOR PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT THAT'S THE QUESTION. YEAH YEAH AND I THINK WHAT I WAS SAY JUST. FACILITIES SOME FIRST STRIVE NOT BEEN FUNDED BY. THE GUARANTEED BEEN FUND OUTSIDE APPEARANCE. IS ONE POINT BILLION YEARS PROP NINETY EIGHT. OF RESOURCE. CURRENT THAT WAS THE QUESTION O IT. WORKERS SINCE I'M NOT GONNA. A CLEAR ANSWER LET ME JUST MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT WE WOULD LOVE THAT YOU GO TO MAY. TO CONSIDER THE OTHER NEEDS FOR THE ONE TIME FUNDS. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE FOUND THIS BUT MAKE SURE WE FUNDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY OF USING THE ONE TIME FUNDS FOR OTHER THINGS. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE ONE EIGHT THAT COMES FROM. THE COMMITTEE- SENATOR MANCHIN AGAIN THIS WEEKEND- OUR LIFE. WELL WE'RE GONNA ANNOUNCED THE BEGINNING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO ONE A ONE B. ONE C. ONE G. BUT- M. ONE C. IS DIFFERENT THAN ONE A. AND ONE B. ONE G. COMPARES THE MALL SO I THINK THAT WE MIGHT ASK A FEW QUESTIONS ALONG THE WAY. BUT EXPECTED OUR DISCUSSION. MIGHT ALSO BE UNDER ONE DAY. THEN I SENT MEANT. I GUESS THE QUESTION I FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALTHOUGH- I THINK THAT- FROM EDUCATION PUBLIC ANSWERED AS WELL- THIS IS A PRETTY AMBITIOUS PROPOSAL AND- IT'S A LOT OF MONEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I GUESS. THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WAS THIS PROPOSAL SOMETHING THAT WAS DRAFTED AND DEVELOPED BY THE COMMUNITY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR OR THE SYSTEM. OR WAS THIS CREATED BY THE PARDON OF FINANCE- AND I ASK THAT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT. WHETHER WE HAVE THE DEMAND I MEAN WE DON'T AS WE'VE DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNS OF POTENTIALLY DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES- YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN OUTLAY OF THIS SIZE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IT APPROPRIATE. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE GIVEN THE FACTS ON THE GROUND. AND I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THE CCC'S WERE SAYING. I GUESS I GUESS THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS THIS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE WAS THIS SOMETHING WAS THIS DETAIL PROPOSAL SOMETHING WAS DEVELOPED PRIMARILY BY CCCS. OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL CAME UP WITH. THIS PROPOSAL DEVELOPED IN AN TRY AFTER THE- OKAY AND WAS IT IN CONSULTATION OF THE CCC'S OF THE PREVENTABLE FROM THE COMMUNITY CULTURES- AND WORK WITH THEM ON NUMEROUS PROPOSALS BUT NO THIS WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY ATTRACTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND SO I GUESS THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION THAT THEN IS- D. DO YOU SEE THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR THIS I MEAN WHAT WHAT'S THAT ONE OF THE FACTS ON THE GROUND THAT YOU WOULD SAY JUSTIFY THIS TYPE OF SIGNIFICANT OUTLAY. I THINK WE SEAT. YOU HAVE REALLY TWO ISSUES ONE BEING. I NEED TO HAVE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE AND IN SEVERAL INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE ARE DISPLAYING- THAT ARE DISPLAYING STAFFING SHORTAGES AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW CONSISTENT WITH THE OUR OUR PROPOSED BROAD GOAL OF. HAVING 70% DEGREE ATTAINMENT YOU KNOW IMPROVING OPPORTUNITIES IN COLLEGE GOING CULTURE TO HAVE MORE STUDENTS YOU KNOW HOW THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FROM HIGH SCHOOL TRANSITIONING OVER INTO OUR COLLEGE SYSTEM WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND I SHARE THOSE GOALS BUT IF THE FACT IS IF PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY ATTEND THESE CLASSES OR THESE PROGRAMS- THEN WE'RE JUST SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY FOR NO GOOD PURPOSE SO. I DEFINITELY MY MAIN CONCERN ABOUT THIS- AND IT REALLY IS CONCERNING TO ME THAT THIS WAS DRAFTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. NOT IN RESPONSE TO A PARTICULAR QUESTION REQUEST BY CCC- WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE THE PROPER ORDER OF THINGS AND JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF MONEY DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD BE- RECKLESS WITH THAT I THINK ALL OF OUR BUDGETARY DECISIONS OUGHT TO BE GROUNDED IN- YOU KNOW FACTS ON THE GROUND AS I SAID IN AND IT CONCERNS ME THAT. AT THIS APPEARS TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS CAME UP WITH I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A JUSTIFICATION FOR IT AND IT'S CENTER WHERE THE CHIRLA POINTED OUT. THERE ARE A LOT OF NEEDS RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE COULD BE ALLOCATING THOSE FUNDS TO INSTEAD COBB BUT I WILL RESERVE JUDGMENT UNTIL WE- I GUESS SEE MORE DETAILS THANK YOU. AND LET ME SAY ONE THING IN DEFENSE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HE JUST TO FIND THE CCC ACRONYM AS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THAT WAS VERY GOOD BECAUSE I'M SURE PEOPLE AT HOME THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. IT IS OCHO BUG IT. JUST ONE REALLY QUICK BUT WHAT IF WE DO FIND THE PROGRAM IS THIS TIME I KNOW THAT THEIR OTHER PER THERE ARE CURENTLY ADDRESSING THE- THE NEW CAREER STANDING AREAS AND I'M JUST IN CASE WE DIDN'T FIND SOMEBODY ELSE'S. LIFE EXPECT BOTH IN MY PHONE. ALL WANT WHEN YOU'RE YOUR. SO I'M JUST GONNA WHAT WHAT WHY OR. FIFTY SO I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT TO REMIND ALL SO IT'S NOT MINE. MY NOT. TO TRY TO SEE IF MAYBE HE'S RESTARTING AT OKAY. SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT- CURRENTLY LOCALLY WITHIN DISTRICTS- OUTSIDE OF OUR TRADITIONAL- COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND SUPPORT THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF. I TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF DIFFERENT CAREERS WITHIN THEIR REGION. AND R. O. B. PROGRAMS- AS AN EXAMPLE OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS- THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES CAREER TECH- COLLEGES. IS THIS FUNNY SUPPOSED TO GO TOWARDS THESE ARE CURRENT PROGRAMS AND IN PLACE OR IS THIS. COMPLETELY A SEPARATE PROGRAM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND AND IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DIDN'T PROVIDE THIS FUNDING RIGHT NOW. IN THE SPECIFIC AREA. THIS FUNDING IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE CAREER ACADEMIES- YOU KNOW ACADEMIC SUPPORTS. THAT WILL FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC AREAS IN THE TRANSITION FROM HIGH SCHOOLS IN TO- INTER COLLEGE- ULTIMATELY IT YET CAN BUILD UPON EXISTING. PROGRAMS AND SCHOOLS TO PULL TOGETHER- THAT SAID ON THE DOWNSIDE OF NOT DOING THIS YEAR'S WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NEED FOR SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE IN MANY AREAS WE KNOW WE'RE SEEING STAFFING SHORTAGES. WE KNOW WE NEED TO INCREASE COLLEGE GOING RATES TO HELP ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DON'T PURSUE THIS PROPOSAL- AND DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME TYPES OF SUPPORTS TOWARD MEETING THAT IN GOAL. OKAY LET ME SEE IF I CAN THIS IN LITTLE DIFFERENT. SO CURRENTLY WE HAVE AND I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TO THREE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS- IN MY DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE- THE SEVEN CHURCHES IS THE CURRENT DEMAND THAT WE HAVE FOR YOU- CAREERS OR THE SHORTAGE THAT WE HAVEN'T. IN CRANE CAREERS- IN AREAS SO FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE THE R. P. PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE BETTER ADDRESSING THIS TRYING TO BRING IN SKILLED- PERSONNEL TO COME AND TEACH OUR STUDENTS ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. 'M IN AREAS THAT YOU KNOW ARE NEEDED. REGIONALLY WE HAVE- CAREER TECH SCHOOLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY DOING THE SAME THING THEY'RE- THEY'RE COLLABORATING WITH LOCAL CHAMBERS AND- AND LOCAL INDUSTRIES TO SEE. WHAT IS IT WHAT WHAT IN THE WORK FORCE TO THE NEED TO. WHAT AREAS IN WORKFORCE OF THE NEED TO SO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW IS WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING- IN AREAS SUCH AS MINE. SO I'M JUST GONNA HERE IS THIS FUNDING GOING TO HELP THOSE PROGRAMS ALWAYS IS INTENDED TO. CREATE ANOTHER- OTHER VENUES- FIND OTHER PROGRAMS. NEW PROGRAM WE'LL SEE ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THEM. SURE IT IT IN FIRST TWO THE FOLK IS ON. OF THE THAT ARE WE WOULD CONSIDER CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS WHICH IS A LOT OF WHAT THE FOCUS IS ON YOU KNOW THROUGH CURRENT PROGRAMS TO WORKERS WERE ATTEMPTING TO FOCUS ON NEW AREAS WERE ATTEMPTING TO FOCUS ON AREAS THAT OFTEN REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT. A COLLEGE EDUCATION OR HAVE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS TO COLLEGE EDUCATION I'M SO CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THAT'S ARE FOCUSED ON WE DON'T THINK THE CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE NECESSARILY FOCUSED ON THOSE PARTICULAR HERE LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP. YOU MIGHT NEED TO HEAR. AND THE FOLLOW UP IS- BECAUSE I THINK WHAT THE SENATOR WAS TRYING TO ASK IS THIS IS AN OVERLAY TO OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT DOESN'T DUPLICATE THEM AND ADDS TO THEM. AND THE BASIC UNDERLYING PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS NOW WILL CONTINUE AND IF THIS WAS APPROVED THIS WOULD BE AN OVERLAY THAT WOULD ADD. TO IT. IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH THAT WOULD BE GREAT OKAY. IT AND THE SENATOR MAY HAVE WANTED TO KNOW OF THE JUSTIFICATION FOR HAVING THE OVERLAY BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT OF HER QUESTIONS WERE DRIVING ACTED AND NOW SINCE I PUT ALL THESE WORDS IN THE SENATOR SMITH LET ME RECOGNIZE TO SENATOR. THE DECLARED I RESPECT YOU ALWAYS ACTUALLY CAN BE MADE AS LITTLE MORE TICKET LET ALONE ELOQUENTLY AND I DO SO I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR ASSISTANCE- ONE LAST QUICK. WELL MORE OF A COMMENT I GUESS BECAUSE- HE HAD A QUESTION FOR ME BUT MORE OF A COMMENT- I WANT TO BEG TO DIFFER. BECAUSE I- I ASSURE YOU THAT THE PROGRAMS IN THE SCHOOLS THAT I'M CURRENTLY VISITING- IN MY DISTRICT IN MY REGION. ARE SPECIFICALLY- ADDRESSING OR ENQUIRING AS TO THE CURRENT NEED FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- THEY'RE CURRENTLY AT IN WORKING COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL INDUSTRIES TO FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY IT IS THAT IS NEEDED IN OUR REGION TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN THAT SPECIFIC WORKFORCE. IN THAT AREA SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE IN MY REGION AND I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF EXCITED NOT TO HEAR THAT- THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY BEING VERY PROACTIVE THAT WE ARE. YOU KNOW TRYING TO PURSUE THIS YEAR LEGISLATIVELY FACT WE HAVE SCHOOLS ALREADY IN PLACE THAT ARE CURRENTLY DOING THAT AND I. I COMMEND THEM FOR THOSE EFFORTS FOR TAKING THE INITIATIVE AND- IN BEING PROACTIVE ON THAT FRONT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I THINK THAT COMPLETES- ISSUE ONE A IN FRONT OF A CLEARLY WELL CALF AND THEY DID. COMMITTEE AND SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE ONE B. DUAL ENROLLMENT ALSO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITH THE SAME THREE PANELISTS THAT WE HAD ON THE FIRST ISSUE WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I CAN MORNING AGAIN LIST MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. RECENT RESEARCH FOR ME SHE GAVE US A THIS WILL HOUSE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEADERSHIP AND SEARCH AND THE CASE ROUGHLY EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT POPULATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN DISSIPATED AND AT LEAST ONE DORM ROOM OF COURSE OPPORTUNITY WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER AND NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN BENEFITS FOR PARTICIPANTS I DO ONE MOMENT RELATIVE TO NON PARTICIPANTS. INCLUDING DONNELLY IS HAVING HIGHER RATES OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AND COLLEGE ENROLLMENT CREDIT ACCUMULATION. PERSISTENCE AND COMPLETION- FOR EXAMPLE A RECENT PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALICE'S INDICATED THAT 44% EVERY SINGLE MOMENT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN. TWO YEAR COLLEGES COMPARED GRADUATES AND 3637% ENROLLED IN FOUR YEAR COLLEGES COMPARED 226% OF ALL GRADUATES. DESPITE THE NUMBER STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN DUAL ENROLLMENT OPPORTUNITIES INCREASING IN RECENT YEARS THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE'S RESEARCH INDICATES THAT PARTICIPATION IN DAHLE ROMAN OPPORTUNITIES AND OUTCOMES VARIES ACROSS RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS AND SOME DAHLE ROMAN OPPORTUNITIES DO NOT LEAD TO COLLEGE CREDIT. IN ORDER TO EXPAND ACCESS AND PARTICIPATION IN ONE MOMENT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO INCENTIVIZE THE OFFERING A BILL ROMAN OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE ALSO COUPLED WITH STUDENT ADVISING AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO AWARD THREE TYPES OF COMPETITIVE GRANTS LEN. MONEY CAN BE USED TO ONE COUPLE WERE BEST STUDENT ADVISING AND SUCCESS SUPPORTS WITH AVAILABLE DAHLE MOMENT IN ACCELERATED COLLEGE CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES. TO PLAN FOR AND STARTUP- A MIDDLE AND AN EARLY COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL LOCATED ON THE CAMPUS OF AN- EARLY AGE. AND THREE ESTABLISH A COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAY AGREEMENT. AND FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS COMMENTS WILL MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE MORNING AGAIN MICHAEL OF THAT AS WITH THE L. A. O. WE HAVE A- OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THE PROPOSAL IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT IDENTIFIED WHAT PROBLEMS CURRENTLY EXIST FOR GLUING ROMAN IN PARTICULAR THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SPECIFY WILL BEAR YEARS ELLIE EIGHT CURRENTLY FACE IN IMPLEMENTING TO ON THE PROGRAMS AND HOW IT IS NOT FUNDING MIGHT REMOVE THESE BARRIERS. FOR EXAMPLE MOST OF THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR GOING HOME AND IS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS TUTORING. IF THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SPECIFY HOW CURRENT FUNDING. IS USED TO SUPPORT- STUDENTS IS ADEQUATE AT HIGH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. GIVEN THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES CURRENTLY ARE RECEIVING FUNDING FROM THE STATE FAR IN EXCESS OF THEIR MOMENT LEVELS. WE QUESTION WHETHER STUDENTS INCLUDING NEWLY ENROLLED STUDENTS. HAVE A AN ADEQUATE ACCESS TO TUTORS COUNSELORS AND OTHER SUPPORT STAFF. IN THE CASE OF ONE DOOMBEN TYPE OF PROGRAM CALLED CAREER AND- SORRY CREATING COLLEGE ACCESS PATHWAYS PROGRAM WHICH I'LL REFER TO AS HE CAPPED. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THE FUNDING BARRIERS EXIST AT ALL. OF THAT IS GENERAL INTEREST PROGRAMS HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN RECENT YEARS TO GET FROM WOMEN HAS GROWN EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC GOING AGAINST THE OVERALL TREND. OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. MORE RATHER THAN POSING VERY SEEK FUNDING POLICIES CAN WORK TO BENEFIT OF SCHOOL AND COLLEGES IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE. WITH STUDENTS SIX HE KEPT HORSES IN PLACE OF THE REGULAR HIGH SCHOOL COURSEWORK. IN SUCH CASES SCHOOLS CAN RECEIVE ATTENDANCE BASED FUNDING EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY ONLY BE. PROVIDING THREE HOURS OF INSTRUCTION RATHER THAN THE STANDARD SIX HOURS OF INSTRUCTION PER DAY. AS FAR AS WITH THE GOLDEN STATE PATHWAYS PROPOSAL WE HAVE CONCERNS THIS PROPOSAL DOES LITTLE LITTLE TO TARGET FUNDING TO STUDENTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT MOST FROM THE PROGRAM- AS WITH THAT PROGRAM IF THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS A DORM A PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WAYS TO TARGET FUNDING TO SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS WITH HIGHEST NEED. A COMPOSER COMMENTS THANK YOU. AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE MORNING BE CALLOUS AGAIN FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- THE CITY AGREES WITH THIS- MY EYES PROPOSAL. AND ALSO WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE NORMAL PROGRAMS MY DIVISION- SUPPORTS EARLY COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL AND MIDDLE COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER NUMERIC PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND YOUR MOMENT PROGRAMS- BETWEEN SECONDARIES ARE SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST FUNDING HAPPENS REFLECTIONS RIPPER SHAPE THAT BONE. I'M JUST GONNA ASK ONE QUESTION ON THIS BECAUSE I KNOW WILL REVISIT ALL OF THESE UNDER INFORMATIONAL ITEM T. BUT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST THEY TALKED ABOUT. THE HOTSPOT THEY'RE NOT BEING CLARITY ON HOW THIS WILL ADDRESS THE BARRIERS THAT ARE DONE FIVE DID THEY ALSO MENTION TUTORING COULD YOU RESPOND. TO THE CONCERNS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. SURE CHRIS FERGUSON FINANCE I THINK FROM OUR PER. WE NOTE THAT THAT PART OF THE ISSUE IS JUST. AND UNDER- ENROLLMENT. IN THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT COULD BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF DUAL ENROLLMENT OPPORTUNITIES WE KNOW THAT THE DATA CLEARLY DISPLAYS. THAT STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO TO COLLEGE- SO CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW THAT'S SORT OF OUR FOCUS AND THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS MEDIAN. TAKE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN DUAL ENROLLMENTCULTURE AND- THAT ALSO HAS THE BENEFIT OF YOU KNOW REDUCING TIME 2 DEGREES USING STUDENTS COST TO OBTAIN A COLLEGE DEGREE- BY ENABLING THEM TO EARN COLLEGE CREDITS WHILE THERE AND IN HIGH SCHOOL. I THINK THAT THAT'S OUR PRIMARY FOCUS K. AND S. I WOULD JUST MAKE A COMMENT WHICH IS HOME. I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHERE. EVERYBODY AGREES ON THE GOAL. THIS IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE GOAL BUT THEY'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT OF A LACK OF CLARITY OF HOW THIS WILL ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SO I JUST HOPE OVER THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND MAY- THAT THAT ISSUE IS CONSIDERED OUR ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THIS. CENTER ROADSHOW. SO S. WHO'S- OF A TWENTY TWO AND A TWENTY YEAR OLD AND THEY WENT THROUGH- THEIR HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY DID PROVIDE DUAL ENROLLMENT ON THERE. MY CHILDREN TOO AB CLASSES. AND ONE OF MY KIDS ACTUALLY WENT IN WITH ENOUGH CREDITS WITH AID TO BE A JUNIOR TRYING TO SEE WHAT THE BARRIERS RIGHT NOW TO DUAL ENROLLMENT BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE DID NOT CHOOSE TO DO THAT AND I WASN'T SURE WHETHER OR NOT. IT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIGH SCHOOL. DIPLOMA ALONG WITH A CERTIFICATE OR- DID IT EFFECTIVE- THEIR GPA WHAT WHAT. SORT OF. OBSTACLES YOU SEE TO HAVING- ARE GOING THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE FOR HIGH SCHOOL SAID I HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THOSE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGH SCHOOLS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE THE PROGRAM. SURE RIGHT I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE TYPE OF REQUISITE SUPPORT SERVICES TO ALWAYS BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES OF COURSE OUR OUR FOCUS IS. THEN YOU KNOW COURSES THAT I YOU KNOW OFFER THAT COLLEGE CREDIT WE KNOW THE DATA. FROM RECENT REPORTS FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA ARE INDICATING THAT MANY OF THE DUAL ENROLLMENT COURSE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TODAY ARE ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON REMEDIAL. COURSEWORK THE DOES NOT COUNT FOR COLLEGE CREDIT- SHOULD CERTAINLY I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO CHIU FOCUSED ON COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES THAT ISSUE COLLEGE LEVEL UNITS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THE GREEN UP PROGRAM SO YOU KNOW UPON. ENTERING A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY SO THAT I IT HELPS WITH TIME ABOUT A COUPLE OF THE BARRIERS THAT ADDS A HIGH SCHOOLS ONE OF THE BARRIERS THAT WE PERTAINING TO LEAVE FROM SCHOOLS. IS THAT THE STAFFING IF YOU WERE A DEVELOP THE AGREEMENTS TO ENTRENCH. I WOULD THIRD LOOK COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TO PULL TOGETHER THE DIP COURSE ON AND- THE THAT THERE IS. A NEED SUPPORT FOR THEM TO HAVE A SUPPORT PERSON THE POLL THAT. TOGETHER INITIALLY- AND THEN THE SECONDARY PIECE THAT WE PUT FORWARD WHICH IS YOU KNOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS. IN TAKING THOSE COURSES FOR THEIR SUCCESSFUL- WHEN THEY TAKE THAT COURSE THE FIRST TIME SO WE JUST NEED THE SUPPORT SERVICES. AS A NECESSARY COMPONENT AND IN SUPPORTING ALL TYPES OF STUDENTS IN THESE COURSES- AND CERTAINLY- THE DATA DOES SUGGEST AT THE MOMENT THAT. THERE MAY BE SOME EQUITY ISSUES AND WHO IS ACCESSING CURRENT- DUAL ENROLLMENT OPPORTUNITIES- WITH THE ODD UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. I'M NOT ALWAYS BEING HAVE THE SAME- HAVING THE SAME TYPE OF ACCESS TO THESE COURSES. I'M SO CERTAINLY WE'RE TRYING TO INCENT ABROAD USE AND ACCESS OF THESE COURSES STATEWIDE- WE KNOW IT VARIES DEPENDING ON WHAT AREA OF THE STATE YOU YOU ARE LOCATED IN AND WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. HAVE YOU. CARRERA ACCESS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS IN PLACE- WE. KNOW MANY NEW BUT NOT OLD. I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TO TRYING TO. THE STUDENTS THAT WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS I TRULY TRULY APPRECIATE THE MERIT BEHIND THAT. AND THEN ONE LAST QUESTION- THE CURIOUS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WHY IS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING ONE TIME FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS THAT WILL NEED ON GOING- OUR- SUPPORT PERSPECTIVE IT GETS THE BALANCE OF AVAILABLE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES- THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY SO IT IT DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFIC FISCAL YEAR- IT JUST DEPENDS ON. WHETHER YOU KNOW THE WHICH ULTIMATELY LEADS TO WHETHER THOSE FUNDS ARE ONE TIME OR ONGOING YOU KNOW- THERE'S ROUGHLY A BALANCE THAT SPLIT BETWEEN AVAILABLE ONGOING RESOURCES AVAILABLE ONE TIME RESOURCES WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAXIMIZE. THE ONE TIME RESOURCES WE HAVE OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD- UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE- YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF- ONGOING RESOURCES THAT WOULD ALLOW ONGOING COMMITMENT IN THIS AREA PARTICULAR FUNDING YOU WILL ACTUALLY SET IT ASIDE TO ASSURE THAT IT ACTUALLY. IS AVAILABLE FOR THE FOLLOWING COUPLE WHAT IS IT FIVE YEARS THREE YEARS OR FIVE YEARS. ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT THAT WE- SO WE I'M SORRY BECAUSE BECAUSE I GUESS WITH THE OTHER PROBLEMS AS WELL WHEN YOU HAVE PROGRAMS IN FUNDING AVAILABLE. THROUGH A PERIOD OF TIME. DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU SPECIFICALLY PUT THAT THOSE FINDINGS. TO THE SIDE AND SAY OKAY THIS WILL BE A SPREAD OVER THREE FIVE YEARS- OR DO YOU MAKE THAT COMMITMENT HERE BUT IF THE FUNDING IS NOT. ONE THREE OR FIVE YEARS. THEY DON'T RECEIVE IT HOW DOES THAT WORK. SHE WHAT THE WAS TRY THE GREEN ISN'T TO COVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WOULD BE SPENDING AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ON THE STREET SUPPORT SERVICES SITE- IN TERMS OF ENTERING INTO PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS AND DEVELOPING SOME OF THE COURSE WORK REVIEW THAT. AS A MORE LIMITED TERM ACTIVITY- AND THAT PARTICULAR COMPONENT IS ONLY FOR ONE YEAR BUT THE PROGRAM FOR AT LARGE AND IS EXPECTED TO COVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD AND GRANTEES ARE EXPECTED TO USE THOSE RESOURCES. OVER THAT MULTI YEAR PERIOD. FOR JUST FOR CLARIFICATION YOU WILL SET THIS MONEY ASIDE. AND BE ASSURED THAT IT WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THAT PERIOD OF TIME THAT IT'S A- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. I'LL NETWORK THAT'S- OKAY THANK YOU. I KNOW IT IN A THE SENATOR MAN HAS QUESTION BUT IF I CAN OFFER A. B. COMMENT ON THE LAST EXCHANGE HELLO I KNOW THIS IS PROP NINETY EIGHT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO US- ON MR FERGUSON WHERE HE WAS WHEN I WAS A CABINET SECRETARY FOR EIGHT YEARS AND FINANCE WAS ALWAYS SAYING WE CAN'T DO. NEW ON GOING PROGRAMS WITH ONE TIME FUNDS AND THEN I WAS FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND SO I AM AMUSED BY THIS AND JUST REALLY WISH HE HAD BEEN IN THE RESOURCES ASSIGNMENT WHEN I WAS BY CABINET SECRETARY LET ME RECOGNIZE- CENTER MAN OKAY HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AFTER.

EXEMPT COMMITTEE JUST HEARD THE PATHWAYS GRANT PROGRAM IS REALLY A UNIQUE TYPE OF DUAL ENROLLMENT THE COHORT OF STUDENTS TO START TOGETHER NINTH GRADE. THEY TAKE A MIX OF HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES AND THEY CONTINUED. TO AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE IN A TECHNOLOGY OR SCIENCE RELATED FIELD.

AND WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING STEM PATHWAYS TO MORE CURRENT- POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY LEFT OUT. 64% DIVIDENDS- THAT ARE BEING SERVED ARE FEMALE AND REPRESENTS A WIDE DIVERSITY INCLUDING GREATER REPRESENTATION OF BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS. HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS- AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE COMPARISON MOMENT BUT LET ME ASK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- OF.

THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED- WE ACTUALLY COLLECT I JUST STATUS UPDATES FROM EACH OF THE PROGRAM'S WILD IT AS A SHARED- WE DON'T HAVE A REPORT DUE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE DO HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY STATUS. THAT AND GIVEN THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ADVANCE OF ME REVISED TO HELP INFORM YOUR DECISIONS ON THAT IS WHERE SOME OF OUR ENROLLMENT DATA COMES LET ME KNOW THAT- NUMBER STUDENTS WERE SERVING- AND THE RACE AND ETHNICITY COMPOSITION OF THE STATE. GROUPS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. CENTER GROVE TROUBLED YOU COULD MAYBE ASK HIM AND THE NEXT THING IF YOU'RE STILL SO LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE ONE D. WHICH IS COMPARING THE GOLDEN STATE PATHWAYS GRANT PROGRAM DUAL ENROLLMENT. AND PATHWAY GRANT PROGRAM FOR HIGH SKILLED CAREER SEN WE HAVE A CHART. BOSTON ARE GENDER THAT COMPARES TO THREE AND WE JUST HEARD ABOUT EACH ONE. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S- ANYONE MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IF THERE'S ANYONE THAT WISHES TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE OVERVIEW OF COMPARING THREE. I DON'T KNOW IF MISTER STATE HOUSING OR MISTER OFFERS HAS ANY COMMENTS OR I SEE MR CABRAL RISING- IN THE- DIGITAL ETHER HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING MR CABRAL IF A GOOD MORNING- MISTER MEMBERS UNDER CABRAL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS IS THAT LOOK THROUGH I THINK WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND I THINK- YOU KNOW ASKING THE SIDE BY SIDE YOU CAN SEE THE AREAS WHERE THEIR SIMILARITIES THEY ALL ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE SORT OF SAME LONG TERM. GOAL IN A LOT OF WAYS OF INCREASING- THE EDUCATION AND SKILLS THAT THAT STUDENTS HAVE SO THEY CAN FIND OCCURS IN THE WORKFORCE- BUT THEY DO HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- ELEMENTS FOR DOUBLE THE COVERAGE OF PARTICULAR- HAS A GREATER FOCUS ON- ALIGNING WITH EIGHT ZERO COMMENTS THURMOND THAT THEIR PROPERTIES ARE GETTING A FOUR YEAR DEGREE I THINK I WOULD JUST RE READING SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ARE THAT YOU KNOW WITH WITH ALL THESE LAYERS OF PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTING ONGOING PROGRAMS THAT EXIST- BUT CRITICAL EDUCATION. BUT THIS IS A LOT OF- WE'RE NOW I'M IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS OF THE BE A THREAT TO BE BURDENSOME I'M I THINK OTHER THING I WOULD I WOULD NOTE THAT ON ON THIS ISSUE OF AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THE THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE. HELPING TO IMPROVE PARTICULARLY FOR- STUDENTS WHO HAVE OUR WEATHER STARTS HAD A ROUTE WORST COLLEGE AGREED OUTCOMES I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS PART OF THE GOAL OF THE BOB DOLE ENROLLMENT OTHERS AND SOME OF THE RECENT REPORTS THERE WAS- PARENTS THAT THE BENEFIT OF DOING THAT ARE NOT SPREAD EVENLY THROUGHOUT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE CAN GIVE YOU DO OF COURSE ANY OF THESE OPTIONS WE THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO THESE PROPOSALS. ARE NOT NOTHING IN ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE MIND ADDRESSES ANY OF THOSE ISSUES ARE BETTER THE PRIORITIZATION OF THESE PROGRAMS IS VERY MINIMAL SO IF THAT'S IF YOU'RE ABOVE AVERAGE DROPOUT RATE YOU WOULD GET YOU COULD. ALSO GET FUNDING. THERE NO REQUIRED THEN EXAMPLE ON ONCE. OR OF FUNDING FOR THE THEY PRIOR. THESE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL THAT I WOULD. HAVE LOWER OUTCOMES ABOUT YOUR CALL TEAM AND- WE THINK THOSE ARE. .ORG BE A AN AREA IF YOU DO. ANY OF- THERE'S OFTEN. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT. BUT A SEE ANY OTHER HANG. FROM THE STATE. LEVEL IN THE SO I WOULD. SUGGEST THAT. THE THOSE WERE. AND WE HAVE FOR MONTHS BEFORE THE MAY REVISE OR THREE AND THAT. THAT WE CAN SOME FROM LET ME ASK MY CALL. IF THERE'S QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS POINT SUNDARA CHOLA BOOK. I'M I NOTICED THAT M. WE ONLY HAD SIX COMMUNITY. I'M HOPING. MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY THE PREVIOUS ONE AND I APOLOGIZE BUT I'M JUST GONNA CURIOUS- IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THIS ONE BUT IT MADE TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AS WELL WE CURRENTLY HAVE SIX COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT APPLY TO THE TO THE- PROPERTY PROGRAM. AND WE HAVE I KNOW THEY WERE ORDERED TO SEVEN BUT ONLY SIX QUALIFIED. DO WE HAVE WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA. THE WE ONLY HAVE SEVEN APPLICANTS- IN ONLY SIX THAT ACTUALLY QUALIFY THEY WERE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING THESE THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE IT SEEMS COMPLETELY. UNUTILIZED EVER TRYING TO MAKE ARE. GREATER IMPACT RESISTANCE MORE OF A LIMITED- GROUP OF COLLEGES WERE WERE HELPING SO THAT WE'RE GOING TO STUDY IN THE PROCESS TO SEE IF IT WORKS. MANY TO TAKE THAT QUESTION GOOD MORNING CENTER CHAU BLOKE. AT THE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CROSSER- COLLEGES USUALLY FIFTY FIFTY EIGHT OF OUR DISTRICTS HOW DO ON ROLE MEANT PROGRAMS. SINCE THESE ARE ONE TIME DOLLARS A TEN MILLION ON THE OF WAR IT WAS LIMITED FUNDS ONLY A SEVEN. PARTNERSHIPS COULD BE FUNDED AND ESTABLISHED THEY ALSO HAVE TO STRETCH THOSE RESOURCES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD THIS REALLY HAS TO DO MORE WITH THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE. RATHER THAN- INTEREST IN THESE TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS PARTICULARLY IN AREAS STAND. BECAUSE THERE IS AN INDUSTRY PARTNER COMPONENT. IT IS FAR MORE INVOLVED THAN OTHER AND DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS- BUT WE HAVE SEEN SOME BENEFITS PARTICULARLY. FOR DIVERSE STUDENT GROUPS. SO IS THAT TO UNDERSTAND ASIDE FROM THE ONE TIME FUNDING BEING AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROGRAM IS THAT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE MORE INTEREST- IN THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM ACROSS THE STATE IN THE REST OF OUR COMMITTEE CALL. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE MORE INTEREST AND WE HAVE T GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS THAT WE RECEIVED- BUT WE ALSO- DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO FIND MORE PROGRAMS. SO WE CAN GO BACK AND LOOK- WHEN THE PROVIDE THAT STATUS UPDATE LET YOU KNOW HOW MANY TOTAL APPLICANTS WE RECEIVED- AND WHAT THE INTEREST LOOKS LIKE ACROSS THE STATE. THE FIRST NEW YORK ON. IN THIS SPACE- HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT I USE THIS INFORMATION AND MOVING FORWARD AS- I'M SORT OF A MODEL PROGRAM A PILOT PROGRAM TO SEE HOW IT ACTUALLY- MANIFESTS ITSELF IN. ITS COLD. LATER ON AND THEN PERHAPS IN- WHAT IS THE TWO THOUSAND AND. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX WE ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SOMETHING THAT AS A LEGISLATURE. A GIVEN MAYBE THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM THE THAT WE COULD PROBABLY EXPAND A LITTLE FURTHER ACROSS THE STATE. YES THE REPORTING THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WILL LET US KNOW HOW THE SCHOOL BOARD OF STUDENTS. DID WEATHER AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE CONNECTED TO PROGRAMS OUR COMPLETION RATES AND OTHER HE DATA POINTS- SO THAT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT MARKER. OUT WE CAN ALSO WE CAN PROVIDE A STATUS UPDATE AND SHOW YOU WHERE- HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE PERFORMING NOW. AND HOW MANY ARE BEING SERVED IN TRANSITIONING IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT IT IS IT IS- VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM THAT THAT CAN BE LOOKED AT WITH THE KEY FOCUS ON. IMPACT MAYES. FOR A LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE REPORT ON THE STATUS UPDATE AND HOPEFULLY INCLUDING SOME OF THE DATA ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAMS WITH. THANK YOU BYE CENTER MEANT- YES IT IS NEVER I WOULD LOVE TO I'M PROBABLY PRONOUNCING YOUR NAME INCORRECTLY BUT- IS NEVER AT- PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM DOING THAT- I GUESS I'M CURIOUS GOING BACK TO ISSUE ONE A AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ON THAT PANEL BUT- YEAH I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS ON THE ADMINISTER ABILITY OF. WHAT THE GOLDEN STATE PATHWAYS PROGRAM IS PROPOSING- YOU KNOW IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE IS S. IT BACK BY THE DATA THAT YOU YOU BACK BY THE DEMAND I MEAN IT'S A TO MY EARLIER POINT AND- FOLLOWING THE ISSUE ANY PANEL- YOU KNOW I DID RAISE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT DEPARTMENT FINANCING TO DEVELOP THIS WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH YOU ALSO I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR YOUR REACTIONS TO THIS IN IT. I SEE SEE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE HAD ANY- YOU KNOW A CHANCE TO PROCESS THIS AND WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR YOU. MORNINGS AND US SENATOR MAN. YES YOU PRINTING CORRECTLY THANK YOU. OUT KEY POINTS THAT ALL HIGHLIGHT ONE READ WE DO SEE GREAT VALUE IN DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS AND CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. THAT BEING SAID WE HAVEN'T. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GAUGE- AND DISCUSSED WITH BROADER ONCOLOGY GROUPS AND- WHETHER- THEIR IDEAS AND CONCEPTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOLDEN STATE'S PATHWAYS PROGRAM- I DO SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN GAUGING. AND LEARNING MORE AND HOW- WE CAN BE SUPPORTIVE. OR ANY FEEDBACK FROM. OUR COLLEGES AND DISTRICTS. SO IF I TO TELL IT THEN IS THAT WE HAVE AN DATA ON DEMAND FOR THIS PROGRAM AT THIS POINT. NOT AT THIS POINT- WITH. SPECIFIC LEAD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AROUND HOW MANY STUDENTS WOULD BE SERVED- BUT WE- WE DO KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS COULD POTENTIALLY QUALIFY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN. WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO EXPLORE. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST REITERATE- I THINK MY YEAH I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MORE DETAILS ON ALL THREE PROPOSALS BUT- IT STRIKES ME THAT THE SECOND AND THIRD- WITH A SECOND I WOULD I BELIEVE IS. DEVELOPED IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE THIRD ENVISIONS ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BE ROUTED THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- DOES MAKE SENSE TO ME RATHER THAN. IN OF I HAVE MY RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE FIRST CLEARLY BUT- WILL REMAIN TO BE SEEN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR. N. LET ME THANK ALL THE PANELISTS ON THE FIRST FOUR SUB ISSUES OF ITEM ONE WE HAD A LOT OF FEEDBACK. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS UP UNTIL MAY REVISED. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR BODY BEARING WITH THIS BEING HERE. BECAUSE IT WAS A GREAT DISCUSSION ON. OR WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE LITERACY LITERACY PROPOSAL. THAT'S GOOD STUMBLE OVER LITERACY ARM AND OUR THREE PANELISTS ARE MACHEL VALDIVIA OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AMY LEE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND CHERYL COTTON. THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT FOR INSTRUCTION MEASUREMENT AND IT MINISTRATION. A AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I CAN MORNING CHIANG MEMBERS MUST HAVE A LEGAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUNDS FOR GRANTS TO HIGH NEED SCHOOLS TO TRAIN AND HIRE LITERACY COACHES AND READING SPECIALISTS. ON THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL OR FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AS SET UP AS FORMULA BASED GRANTS GOING OUT ON A PER STUDENT RATE FOR EACH AT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH SIXTH GRADE STUDENT ENROLLED IN AN ELIGIBLE SCHOOL. SUCH THAT NO ELIGIBLE SCHOOL RECEIVED LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS- WE WANT THESE FUNDS TO GO TO OUR MOST HIGH NEED STUDENTS WHICH IS WHY ELIGIBLE SCHOOLS ARE DEFINED AS THOSE WITH ABOUT I. EACH OF THE CARE. I WITHIN THE TEACHER THROUGH FRIENDS IN A POPULAR. OUR MISSION ESTIMATES SHALL ABOUT. SCHOOLS WITH QUALIFY FOR FUNDING UNDER THIS PROPOSED. I'M THE RIGHT THE FUNDING OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS PROVIDED TO CONTRACT WITH. A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY OR LGA TO DEVELOP AND PROVIDE TRAINING FOR LITERACY COACHES AND MEETING SPECIALIST- WITH PRIORITY FOR APPLICANTS WITH THEM. DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS IN IMPROVING LITERACY. I'M LITERACY COACHES CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF STRUGGLING READERS AS THEY DEVELOP. LITERACY PROGRAMS AND THEN TOOK TEACHERS AND IMPLEMENT INTERVENTIONS FOR STUDENTS AND HI IT FOR STUDENTS IN NEED- OF TARGETED LITERATE LITERACY SUPPORT I'M ALSO SOME STUMBLING OVER LITERACY- AND THIS PROPOSAL MAKES THESE COACHES AVAILABLE TO OUR MOST HIGH NEED STUDENTS. I CAN BECAUSE MY PRESENTATION BUT MY COLLEAGUE AMBER ALEXANDER AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH R. O. WILL MOVE. TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRS AND A LEE WITH THE LEGACY ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE WANTED TO SHARE SENSE AND RECOMMENDED ON THE GOVERNOR'S. TO WRITE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME FOR LITERACY COACHES. OVERALL WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PROPOSAL. COOL THREE HAVE A RADIO OF EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES THROUGH WHICH THEY CAN FIND ADDITIONAL LITERACY COACHES MOST NOTABLY AT THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND SEE HOW FAST. THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET EVEN PROVIDED A ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR ONGOING AUGMENTATION TO LCF CONCENTRATION GRANT TO HIRE MORE STAFF FOR DIRECT STUDENT SERVICES INCLUDING LITERACY COACHES. THIS AUGMENTATION AND IT WOULD BE TARGETED MANY OF THE DISTRICTS THAT WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OF PROVIDING RESTRICTED FUNDING FOR CERNER DEAL EARLY LITERACY ACTIVITIES IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE REGIONAL LEGISLATIVE INTENT ALLEYS LOCALLY FUND AND- DETERMINE. PRIORITIES UNDER LCS FAST. STUDY SUGGESTS THAT LITERACY COACHING CAN'T IMPROVE STUDENT READING TEST SCORES IF EXPERIENCED COACHES ARE PLACED IN THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT ALIGN WITH THE RESEARCH IN THREE KEY ASPECTS. FIRST THE PROPOSAL IS NOT TARGETED TO THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS AS INDICATED UNDER THE STATE SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. INSTEAD THE PROPOSAL TARGETS FINDING BASED ON STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS. SECOND TEMPORARY FUNDING COULD LIMIT THE PROPOSAL'S IMPACT. GOVERNOR'S RECALLS A WOULD ONLY PROVIDE FUNDING OVER THREE YEARS GIVEN THE TIME THAT IT TAKES. HIRE TRAIN AND PLAN FOR COACHING COACHES MAY JUST BE STARTING TO BE EFFECTIVE AROUND THE TIME THAT FUNDING WOULD EXPIRE. ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION WOULD NOT PROHIBIT SCHOOLS FROM USING THIS TO SUPPLANT EXISTING FUNDING FOR COACHES ALSO LIMITING THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL. LAST WEEK CURRENT STAFFING SHORTAGES COULD RESULT IN MANY AN EXPERIENCED COACHES BEING HIRED. WE KNOW THAT MANY DISTRICTS ARE FACING WIDESPREAD STAFFING SHORTAGES INCLUDING. FOR LITERACY COACH POSITIONS AFFECT LITERACY TO HAVE. EXPERIENCE TEACHING READING AND THE CLASS. STRONG GRASP READING INSTRUCTION AND INTO. AND EXPIRY WORKING WITH EACH. SUCH CALL LITERACY COACHES COULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO ADDRESS THE STAFFING LIMITATIONS THROUGH THE PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR STATEWIDE TRAINING IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT SUCH TRAINING QUITE EFFECTIVELY BRIDGE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP. ACTUALLY SINCE THE TRAINING MIGHT NOT BE TAILORED FOR EACH SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE REJECTED THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR LITERACY COACHES. IF THE LEGISLATURE HOWEVER WERE INTERESTED IN FINDING THIS PROPOSAL WE DO OFFER SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD. BASED ON SCHOOL FINANCE WILL PERFORMING I FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT COULD EXTEND THE TIMELINE FROM THREE YEARS TO FIVE YEARS AND CLARIFY THE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT EXISTING FUNDING. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND NOW WILL MOVE. ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. MORE MISTER CHAIR AND THEN OF THE CA. I AM SURE ALL COTTON DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE INSTRUCTION MEASUREMENT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I'M PRESENTING TODAY ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC AND INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. FIRST I WISH I WANT TO WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY READ ACROSS AMERICA DAY. WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR'S LITERACY PROPOSAL AS IT RELATES TO STATE SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND STATEWIDE LITERACY AND BY LITERACY CAMPAIGN. MOST RECENTLY HE IS SPONSORING A BILL AB TWO FOUR SIX FIVE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITY LITERACY AND EDUCATION ENRICHMENT THROUGH ESTABLISHING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO ENGAGE FAMILIES TO IMPROVE LITERACY AND BY LITERACY OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS. REACHING LITERACY BY THIRD GRADE HAS LONG BEEN A COUPLE OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND A KEY BENCHMARK AND MEASURING AND PREDICTING STUDENT SUCCESS. WE MUST TAKE BOLD ACTION TO HELP STUDENTS MEET THIS IMPORTANT MILESTONE AND TO PUT THEM ON A PATH FOR LIFELONG LEARNING AND SUCCESS AS OPPOSED TO A PATH. THAT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL DROP OUT OF SCHOOL OR END UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE JUSTICE SYSTEM OVER 70% OF INMATES IN CALIFORNIA I'M SORRY IN AMERICA'S PRISONS. CANNOT READ ABOUT FOURTH GRADE LEVEL THAT NEEDS TO STOP THERE'S NO BETTER TIME THAN THE PRESENT WHEN WE ARE FOCUSED ON TRANSFORMING CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. PUTTING STRONG LEADERS THE ACQUISITION. BOTH ACCESS TO MANY BOOKS AND CAREFUL CURATION OF LIBRARIES TO BE MOST APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENTAL CULTURAL LINGUISTIC AND READABILITY NEEDS. AND ALSO REQUIRES EFFECTIVE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND SUPPORT. AS PART OF THE SUPERINTENDENT'S LITERACY CAMPAIGN THE CITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH WHERE THE STOCKS LAST WINTER BREAK TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE GIFT OF LITERACY CAMPAIGN. ALL STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE WERE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN READING AT HOME AT SCHOOL AND IN THE COMMUNITY DURING THE WINTER BREAK. THROUGH A DIGITAL LITERACY PLATFORM. IN THE THREE MONTHS OFTHIS PARTNERSHIP FROM DECEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE THROUGH FEBRUARY TWENTY SIX TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THERE ARE OVER FIVE MILLION BOOKS READ. AND OVER FOR FORTY TWO POINT SEVEN THOUSAND MINUTES OF READING. THAT SHOWS THAT IF STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED THE ACCESS THEY ARE GOING TO READ. IF WE'RE GOING TO REACH OUT I'M SORRY FOR GOING TO REACH OUR GOAL OF HAVING OUR STUDENTS READ BY THIRD GRADE. SCHOOLS THEBOOKS AND STUDENTS NEED ACCESS TO THESE FOLKS. A SUMMARY OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE HANDED. I WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU AND HAND OUT. WE ALSO LITERACY COACH WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT ONGOING AND STATE LITERACY COACHING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ISOLATED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING OR WORKSHOPS ALONG. TO TRULY SUSTAIN TEACHER PRACTICE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING MUST BE ACTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE I PROVIDE TEACHERS WITH AMPLE TIME TO LEARN PRACTICE IMPLEMENT AND REFLECT ON NEW STRATEGIES. FIRST WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE A STRONG INVESTMENT PROPOSAL PLOY AND TRAIN LITERACY COACHES AND READING LITERACY SPECIALIST STATEWIDE WHICH INCLUDES DEVELOPING SCHOOL LITERACY PROGRAMS MENTOR TEACHERS AND INTERVENTIONS FOR STUDENTS. IN NEED OF TARGETED LITERACY SUPPORT. WHAT THE CURRENT TEACHER SHORTAGE UP LIFTING NEW AND EXISTING TEACHER LEADERS IS IMPORTANT TO RAISING OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT USE OF CULTURE IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING TEACHER PRACTICE AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. ALISON COACHING MODELS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE TIME WORKSHOPS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN TEACHERS AWARENESS OF LITERACY PRACTICES BUT ARE INSUFFICIENT IF THE GOAL IS TO STAINED USE OF EVIDENCE BASED LITERACY PACTICE. AND ALSO COACHING PROVIDES ONGOING JOB EMBEDDED SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS THAT ALLOWS TEACHERS TO PRACTICE SKILLS IN THE CLASSROOM AND RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM COLLEGE. IN ADDITION TO POSITIVE IMPACTS ON TEACHER INSTRUCTION RICERCHE RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT LITERACY COACHING POSITIVELY INFLUENCES STUDENTS AND SPECIFICALLY MULTILINGUAL LEARNERS ACROSS THE CONTINENT AREAS PARTICULARLY WHEN READING LANGUAGE SKILLS VOCABULARY AND SUBJECT AREA COMPREHENSION. OR INTEGRATED INTO THE EFFORT. I'M NOT ANNOUNCED OF SIXTY CAUSAL STUDIES THAT EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF COACHING AND TRY K. TWELVE SCHOOLS INCLUDED LITERACY INCLUDING LITERACY COACHING FOUND LARGE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON TEACHER INSTRUCTION AND SMALL BUT STILL POSITIVE EFFECTS ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. CONVERSELY IMPACTS OF LITERACY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAININGS AND WORKSHOPS WITHOUT COACHING TYPICALLY FAIL TO CHANGE TEACHER PRACTICE AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT CLASSROOM TEACHERS ARE FEELING THE STRAIN OF INSTRUCTION ACROSS THE PANDEMIC THE WEIRDEST OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND ADULTS IS HEIGHTENED. CULTURES ARE EXPERIENCED EXPERT TEACHERS AND LITERACY COACHING PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR CLASSROOM EDUCATORS TO ENTER TEACHER LEADERSHIP AND CONTINUE TO POSITIVELY INFLUENCE INSTRUCTION ACROSS SCHOOL CAMPUSES FOR DIRECT IMPACT TO STUDENTS. THIS OPPORTUNITY SUPPORTS THREE AREAS ONE TEACHERS BILLS SUPPORTED ENCOURAGED AND EMPOWERED BY COACHING MORE LIKELY A TEACHER WHO FEELS OF. OUR TEACHERS FEEL SUPPORTED ENCOURAGED AND EMPOWERED BY COACHING ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN ENGAGED A PROFESSION IMPROVING BOTH SKILLS AND ASPECT. NUMBER TWO TEACHERS READY TO LEAVE THE PROFESSION NATURES TO STANAGE OCCASION AS A COACH HE BEEN INVALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE ACCORDING EDUCATION AND THREE THE MENTORSHIP ASPECT OF COACHING BUT ALSO HELP ATTRACT NEW TEACHERS TO THE PROFESSION WITH THE SUPPORTED SCAFFOLD ENTRY THAT COINCIDES WITH. THE EFFORTS TO CREATE A MORE EFFECTIVE TEACHER PIPELINE. OUR STATE HAS ESTABLISHED LITERACY COACHING NETWORKS WHICH CAN SUPPORT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN THIS WORK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ALIGNING THIS INITIATIVE WITH OUR CURRENT LITERACY PROJECTS. IN TERMS OF SMALL SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS THE L. A. L. L. A. L.'S POINT WE THINK A CONSORTIUM COACHES COULD BE DEVELOPED TO COVER THAT COVERS MULTIPLE DISTRICTS OR IS EVEN COUNTY Y. IF LEGISLATURE INDIA'S DLF ARE INTERESTED IN THIS IDEA WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON HOW THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED. IN CLOSING WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT IN LITERACY COACHES AS WELL AS THE COMPANION INVESTMENT A MULTILINGUAL AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM LIBRARY. WE CANNOT REPLY SOLELY ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES FOR MANY OF OUR KIDS. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE. LIBRARY HAVE JOHN GETTING IN FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES ALLOW OF READING. IN THIS CRITICAL THAT WE IN THE IN BOOKS LIBRARY. LITERACY COACHES MENTORS AND INTERVENTIONS FOR STUDENTS IN NEED OF LITERACY SUPPORT PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AS THIS PROCESS MOVES FORWARD WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO DEAL AFTER AND THE LEGISLATURE ON SPECIFIC POINTS RELATED TO THESE PROPOSALS. ALIEN THE REINA EDUCATION STRAIGHTER IN THE EDUCATOR EXCELLENCE AND EQUITY DIVISION FOR CD AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THIS IS A TIME FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE WHAT MASS AND GROW TROUBLED. YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. YES MONEY BIG WITH A CAR- SO PERSONAL PRIVILEGE TO HAVE IT IN A DISTRICT THAT WE HAVE LITERACY COACHES- IN PLACE AND I KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE- WITHIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE SCHOOLS- WHEN THEY'RE- WELL TRAINED AND LITERACY- I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED- TO. READ FROM THE CAPITOL WEEKLY THAT- ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE. ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF- SEE A FEBRUARY. IT STATED THE CALIFORNIA SHOCKINGLY HAS THE LOWEST LITERACY RATE OF ANY STATE- AND. WITHIN THE AYE I WANNA JUST KIND OF MENTION BUT WE'RE DOING ALREADY AS FAR AS THE FUNDING GOES FOR LITERACY- AND WHY AM I TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE OBSTACLES HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ARTICLE STATED AND THIS IS SOME FACTS THAT I'M JUST GOING TO FACE BEFORE YOU AS WE CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS PURCHASE PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IT STATES HERE THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY. THE BUDGET INCLUDED FIFTY MILLION TO ESTABLISH BLOCK GRANTS TO IMPROVE LITERACY. AND AN ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION WAS PROVIDED FOR LEAD COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. FOCUSED ON EFFECTIVE LITERACY INSTRUCTION IN EARLY GRADES. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET ALSO INCLUDED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AND IN ADDITION TO TEN MILLION. FOR STATEWIDE PRO STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON READING INSTRUCTION INTERVENTION. M. INTERVENTION IN ADDITION TO STATE FUNDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AN ON GOING BASIS AROUND TWO POINT FIVE BILLION. THAT IS FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING POOR STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND TARGETED TO STUDENTS AND POVERTY AND THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE L. C. F. F. FUNDING. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. AND I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO WHEN I LOOK AT ALFIE A FIVE- WHICH TARGETS UNDUPLICATED KIDS ARE THE OBSTACLES WHAT IS IT THAT- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE WE'VE BEEN. PROVIDING A LOT OF FUNDING FOR LITERACY WHAT OBSTACLES ARE WE ACTUALLY FACING BUT IS NOT ALLOWING US TO ACTUALLY HAVE LITERACY. ON STANDARDS THAT ARE- DIGNIFIED OF OUR KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN GO AHEAD AND START AND OTHERS CAN OUT ON- IF THERE ARE YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO MAKE ON YOUR POINT ABOUT THE OBSTACLES AND OF LCS FACT I THINK- YOU KNOW REALLY THE LCF WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO- ALLOCATE FUNDING BASED ON PRIORITIES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED LOCALLY WE DO KNOW YOU KNOW AND HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS THERE ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM DIFFERENT DYNAMICS THAT PLAY INTO THOSE CONVERSATIONS LOCALLY THEE'S OBVIOUSLY. NO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTSTHERE ARE CERTAIN- YOU KNOW SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY TO COME FORWARD AND ADVOCATE FOR CERTAIN PRIORITIES AND ALL OF THOSE GAMES FACTORED INTO INTO THOSE CONVERSATIONS SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPETING THINK YOU KNOW YOU SEE THIS. ON FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO SUPPORT LITERACY COACHES AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER MORE TARGETED INVESTMENTS THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. I'M BECAUSE WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALSO AFFECT YOU KNOW SHOOTING COULD BE A FUNDING SOURCE TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA. BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE I'M PRIORITIES AND ASK FOR THAT FUNDING AND IN ORDER TO. ENSURE THAT INVESTMENT IS BEING MADE IN THE SPACE WE DO FEEL THAT THESE TARGETED- INVESTMENTS. ARE NEEDED SO THAT FUNDING IS DEDICATED TO THE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE LITERACY OUTCOMES. DIRT COMPLETE YOUR QUESTIONS NOT MY COMMENT THOUGH OH GREG ABBOTT SO. AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVE BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER MY PREVIOUS STATEMENT. THIS WAS IN ADDITION TO THAT. SO THAT THE MONEY THAT I JUST MENTIONED IN TE AMOUNT OF THE MONEY THAT I JUST MENTIONED WAS IN ADDITION TO LCF AT. THERE WERE. ALREADY A KID A QUITE A BIT OF MONEY. TOWARDS LITERACY- THAT IN MY OPINION YOU' THINK THAT SOME OF THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS YOU KNOW. LITERACY COACHES AND WE HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE CURRENTLY HAVE THOSE IN PLACE. SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS- LET ME JUST STATE. WE PROVIDED A LOT OF FUNDING FOR LITERACY- JUST IN THE PAST TWO YEARS AGO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN ADDITION TO LCF AND YOU FIGURE YOU'RE THINKING MY- DISABILITY AND THAT INCLUDED- AS ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS I WOULD BE AVAILABLE ORDER DEDICATED FUNDING FOR- TO ADDRESS LITERACY SO- AT THE. THANK GREAT AND I AM A CENTERMAN OR NOR I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BUT I'M GONNA MAKE A COMMENT. AND- THANK SENATOR OCHO BOWED FOR MENTIONING THE NEWS ARTICLE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO MENTION IT- ON LITERACY. AND I JUST WANT TO SAVE IT. I THINK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S COMMENTS WERE ON POINT AND SO AS WE MOVE TOWARD. A MAY I'D LIKE THERE TO BE A LITTLE FOCUS. ON THIS SO THAT WE KNOW IT'S FOCUSED TO THE PLACES THAT MOST NEEDED AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO SUPPLANT IF IT'S THERE. ARE SO THAT IT'S CLEAR ANNA IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AS I MOVE AROUND AND- IN ALL OUR THE SPRAWLING DISTRICT WITH LOTS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ALL THE STATE. OUR STAKEHOLDERS ARE IN TOUCH REGULARLY ONE OF THEIR BIG BEEFS AND IT ALWAYS AMUSES ME BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT CATEGORICAL IN N. R. WE WENT FROM I'M NOT GONNA GET THE NUMBER RIGHT EIGHTY CATEGORICAL TO TWELVE ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO BUT NOW EVERYBODY'S COMPLAINING ABOUT TWELVE AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A DE FACTO CATEGORICAL IN IN THE MAKING IN THE END SO THE ONE PEOPLE WONDER HOW WE GET TO CATEGORICAL WE GET TO AMOUNT OF THINGS LIKE THIS. IN AND IT'S A A. N. I DON'T WANNA CONFUSE TWO THINGS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S COMMENTS WERE ON THE NEED FOR THIS AND THEY WERE ON POINT BUT THE QUESTION IS THE PROCESS AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IT'S TARGETED FOR MEANT TO BE EFFECTIVE WHICH I THINK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S COMMENTS WERE DIRECTED TO SO WELL THIS IS VERY WORDY AND IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK SHOULD BE DONE UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE IT'S A NEED. THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW IS IT DONE IS IT-DONE IN A FOCUSED WAY IS IT DONE IN A WAY THAT TARGETS WITH THE NEED IS GREATEST AND I THINK THAT'S IN PART WHAT SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST CONFERENCE COMMENTS WERE AND I JUST HOPE THEY'RE CONSIDERED AS WE MOVE AHEAD BUT TOWARD NAY SO I THANK EVERYBODY. FOR THAT PANEL OF WITH BEING WITH US AND WE'LL BE BACK TO THIS IN MAY WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GUIDANCE INITIATIVE C. C. G. I. N. THE PANEL CONSISTS OF ALEC SHOPE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- AMIABLY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND TESSA CARMEN TO ROY THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GUIDES INITIATIVE AND WILL GO IN THAT ORDER AND. BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT FIND- YOU THIS CHAIRMAN MORNING ALEX.

FOR REFERENCE THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR UNIFIED AND HIGH SCHOOL JUST STATEWIDE MEETING THAT'S EASY I COULD SERVE ABOUT HALF OF THE TARGETED DISTRICTS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. ALTHOUGH WE THINK THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATION IS CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE INTENT THE CJI'S PLANS TO SCALE FULLY FOR THE REMAINING DISTRICTS ARE REMAINS UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT THE- COST ONCE HE'S THE GUY IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED. AS SUCH THE CJI CAN BENEFIT FROM A LONG TERM IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING ON THE PROPOSED ONE TIME FUNDING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE THINK SUCH SUPPORT COULD BE REASONABLE BUT A REGIONAL APPROACH MIGHT HAVE LIMITED IMPACT ESPECIALLY AT LEAST. AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THE SELECTED C. O. E.

TWENTY FOUR MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO WAIVE CERTAIN FUTURE EXAMINATION FEES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE TACKLE YEAR. TWELVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO EXTEND THE CURRENT WAIVER OF BLACK CREDENTIAL AND PERMIT CREDENTIAL FEES FOR INDIVIDUALS ENSURING THE EDUCATED WORKFORCE THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE CENTS A YEAR.

FOR PROSPECTIVE EDUCATORS AS WELL AS ONE POSITION WHICH WILL WORK TO DEVELOP A MULTI FACETED WEB PORTAL TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WANTING TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION INTO A P. K.

BACKING COULD MY REMARKS ON GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTMENT TO ADDRESS THE STATE EDUCATOR WORKFORCE SHORTAGE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL MOVE TO. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU IN YOUR VALLEY OUR GANG. SO THERE ARE SOME AND YOU WORK FORCE FOR AND THIS I PLAN TO THROUGH A RECOMMEND. FOR EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS AS LISTED STARTING ON PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. STARTING FIRST WITH THE GOVERNOR'S NEWLY TEACHER RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES WHICH OPPOSES I'M GOING GENERAL FUND TO CTC FOR NEW CAREER COUNSELOR IS A NEW TEACHER RECRUITMENT WEB PORTAL AND A STATEWIDE PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE MODIFY THESE APOSTLES PROVIDE FUNDING TO ONE OF THE EXISTING ENTITIES THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THIS WORK RATHER THAN CTC. BOTH CD II ADDS THE CENTER ON TEACHING CAREERS ARE READY OPERATE SEPARATE ONLINE PLATFORMS TO RECRUIT NEW TEACHERS TO THE PROFESSION AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT TEACHER CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS. THE CENTER ALSO HAS EXPERIENCE RUNNING STATEWIDE GROESCHEL CAMPAIGNS. THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES FOR CTC WOULD. EXISTING EFFORTS RATHER THAN ESTABLISHING ONE COORDINATED AT THE WORD TITO I FORM THAT ALL PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS CAN TURN TO GUIDE THEM THROUGH THE COMP A COMPLEX PROCESS. WE ALSO THINK THAT CD OR THE CENTER WOULD BE BETTER POSITIONED TO TAX WITH ME IN RESPONSE TO PANDEMIC DRIVEN TEACHER SHORTAGES SINCE BOTH READY HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PARTNERSHIPS IN PLACE TO THE GROUND RUNNING. THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER THE BEER STREET OFFICE TO SEE IT WITH MONEY EITHER ENTITY INCLUDING LEVELS OF EXPERTISE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE ONLINE PLATFORM AND FUNDING SOURCE. NEXT ON THE PROPOSAL TO REESTABLISH THE PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAMS ARE P. MATH. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL DISTRICTS ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO PERSONAL MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE THROUGH THE FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM PERFECT MATCH. AND HE'S CURRENTLY DISTRICTS CAN REQUEST FIGMENT TO STUDY AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE THE DISTRICTS EACH. TEACHER HIRING PROCESS HE TO RETENTION RATE AND SUPPLY OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED. TEACHERS THAT'S COULD HAVE DECENT ESPECIALLY IF DISTRICTS CURRENT ARE DRIVEN BY COLLECTIVE. AGREEMENTS WHICH ARE IN LINE TO CHANGE. I'M MOVING ON TO THE CRASH THEME IN EXAMINE THEME. REBEKAH SELECTING REACH BOTH THESE FOR. WE FEES WE ARE TO MOST R. O. MORTE TO PROFESSION AND ADDRESS THE CURRENT TEACHER SHORTAGES ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST TEACHERS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE SWEEPERS BEFORE APPLYING TO PROGRAMS OTHER EFFORTS SUCH AS STREAMLINING THE STATE'S COMPLEX CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS COULD MORE EFFECTIVELY LOWER BARRIERS TO BECOMING A TEACHER. LASTLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A PROPOSAL FOR AN INTEGRATED UNDERGRADUATE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS THESE PROGRAMS OFFER A COST EFFICIENT AND QUICKER OPTION FOR INTERESTED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO RECEIVE TRAINING AND THEN BECOME TEACHERS AFTER GRADUATION. I COMPLETE MY TESTIMONY BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. GOOD MORNING SENATOR LETTER TO MEMBERS OF THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION MY NAME IS MERRY FIXIE SANDY ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMISSION. ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND I'M JOINED TODAY BY THE COMMISSION CERTIFICATION DIRECTOR AARON SCRUPLE IN OUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES DIRECTOR DAVID FIGURE. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW REMARKS THREE OF US WILLBE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS WE MOVE ALONG. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES IMPORTANT TARGETED FUNDING THAT WILL COMPLEMENT INVESTMENTS OF MADE IN PRIOR YEARS. TO SUPPORT AND DEVELOP THE TEACHING WORKFORCE PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF GRANTS ONGOING FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT HAVE WORSENED DURING THE PANDEMIC. DENTAL APPLICATION VOLUME OVERALL IS DOWN FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR TO THE PRESENT BY ALMOST 11% YOU SEEN A DECREASE OF ABOUT 11% OVERALL IN THESE LAST TWO YEARS I IN OUR CREDENTIAL APPLICATION VOLUME. DESPITE THE OVERALL DOWNTURN HOWEVER PRELIMINARY TEACHING CREDENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES CREDENTIAL APPLICATIONS HAVE ISSUED IN THE LAST YEAR- REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF ABOUT 15% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR THIS MAY BE DUE IN PART TO THE EARLY INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IN THE RESIDENTS GRANT PROGRAMS THE LOCAL SOLUTIONS. AND OTHER OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY PERMITS ISSUED. IN THE LAST YEAR DECREASED BY ALMOST HALF IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE MOSTLY LIKELY THE MOST LIKELY TO THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF FULLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. IN CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OF WHICH PREPARES CLOSE TO HALF OF THE TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENTS DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS WELL- THEY DECLINED BY ABOUT 10% BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY ABOUT A 24% INCREASE BETWEEN THESE INCREASES IN THE NUMBERS OF CREDENTIALS ISSUED THE ENROLLMENTS ARE MOST LIKELY DUE TO FLEXIBILITY AS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSION FOR EDUCATOR PREPARATION PROGRAMS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BY LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO ALLOW PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO DEFERRED COMPLETION OF THEIR READING INSTRUCTIONAL COMPETENCE ASSESSMENT. AND TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS AND ENTER. THE PROFESSION. NEARLY TAKEN TOGETHER WE BELIEVE WE INVEST PROPOSED IN THE BY RIVER A LITTLE EFFORTS AT THIS REGIONAL AND LOCAL AND INDIVIDUAL LEVELS THEY CAN SUPPORT AND GROW THE EDUCATIONAL WORKFORCE IN THE NEAR AND THE LONG TERM I'D LIKE TO- JUST BRIEFLY DISCUSSED THE BEST SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AS WELL HOWEVER WE ARE STRENGTHENING THE COMMISSION'S CAPACITY TO SUPPORT RESPECT RESPECTIVE EDUCATORS AS A CREEK IS A CRITICAL NEED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVER THE LAST DECADE THE DEMAND FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THE COMMISSION CERTIFICATION DIVISION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CURRENTLY WE RESPOND TO BETWEEN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EMAIL AND ENGAGE IN ABOUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED ONLINE CHATS PER WEEK OF ENGAGING WITH CANDIDATES SEEKING INFORMATION ABOUT CREDENTIALING A TO DATE YEAR TO DATE WE HAVE I RESPONDED TO SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND EMAIL AND OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND LIVE CHATS THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF OPTIONS AND PATHWAYS TO MEET PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDING UNDERGRADUATE INTEGRATED PREPARATION AND YOU THREE PROGRAMS. INTERNSHIP ROUTES INTO TEACHING AND DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENCIA CLASSIFIED STAFF PATHWAYS INSTITUTION. AS WELL. HE'S NEW OP FOR PERSPECTIVE TEACHERS WELL AS THE REASON EXPERIENCE OF OUR FOR ME SPACE SKILLS AND SOME MATTER. MAY THE PROCESS OF COULD PREPARATION AND EARNING A TEACHING CREDENTIAL MORE COMPLEX AND OFTEN CONFUSING FOR PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS. THE QUESTIONS ARE SHIFTED FROM HOW DOES ONE BECOME A TEACHER TOO HOW DO I BECOME A TEACHER GIVEN MY UNIQUE SITUATION AND THE ARRAY OF OPTIONS THAT MAKE SENSE. MOST CAREER COUNSELORS WILL BE DEDICATED TO CREATING AN ONLINE SYSTEM THAT LEADS PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS THROUGH THEIR UNIQUE QUESTIONS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT WHEN NEEDED. ACCESS TO ONLINE INFORMATION ABOUT PATHWAYS OPTIONS FOR MEETING CREDENTIALS PROGRAM AND GRANT OPPORTUNITIES COUPLED WITH DEDICATED STAFF ASSISTANCE WILL ASSIST ALL PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS AND NAVIGATING THE CREDENTIAL PROCESS. THE STATE DOES NEED TO HAVE A COORDINATED AND AUTHORITATIVE PLATFORM RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS AND GUIDING THAT THE PROSPECTIVE WORKFORCE INTO AND THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ARGUE THAT THAT SHOULD BE THE COMMISSION A TEACHER CREDENTIALING. THE LICENSING AGENCY THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY THE CENTER FOR TEACHING CAREERS A TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION PROVIDES AN INVALUABLE RESOURCE AND IN TERMS OF JOB SEEKERS AND A PLATFORM FOR JOB SEEKERS AND JOB. OPPORTUNITIES FOR CANDIDATES SEEKING POSITIONS. THE SITE OFFERED BY THE- HOSTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS ALSO A VERY- INVITING- WEBSITE THAT PROVIDES VERY HIGH LEVEL INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION ABOUT BECOMING A TEACHER BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GUIDING AND DEMYSTIFYING THE PROCESS AND SUPPORTING PEOPLE WHILE THEY MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS. I'M NOT EITHER OF THOSE SITES CAN REALLY TAKE THE PLACE OF THE WORK THE COMMISSION TEACHER CREDENTIALING SHOULD BE DOING WE BELIEVE THAT HAVING ALL OF THOSE SITES AVAILABLE TO OUR PROSPECTIVE EDUCATORS IS REALLY QUITE CRITICAL DURING THIS TIME OF SHORTAGES AND STAFFING NEEDS. RIGHT BACK INCLUDES MY REMARKS FOR NOW I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AS THEY COME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FROM. THAT COMPLETES THE PAN AND WILL BE TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUITE TO EITHER CAR HAVE QUESTIONS- CENTER ROADSHOWS WILL. I'M CURIOUS TO SEE FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY RESPONSE BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO WITH REGARDS TO- MISS- ARE WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE. WE ARE LOOKING FOR A HALF DAY THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING THAT'S WHO JUST SPOKE YES BUT I DON'T HAVE HER NAME ON OUR MERRY SANDY I'M SORRY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I'M SORRY SAID ADDING HAVE YOUR NAME. ON OUR LIST HERE- BUT I'VE I'M HERE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON YOUR RESPONSE. SURE HAPPY TO WEIGH IN ON THAT ANYBODY FROM ALABAMA SO I THINK DOCTOR SANDY'S COMMENTS ARE WILL TAKE AND I THINK. THAT THE MAIN CONCERN IS THAT WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE INTERESTED IN THE TEACHING PROFESSION ARE REACHING OUT TO CDC THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE READY TO THINKING ABOUT BECOMING A TEACHER I THINK OUR OR COMMENTS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE. ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT THE BROADER POOL OF TEACHERS AND ATTRACTING MORE FEATURES THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE THINKING ABOUT- TEACHING TO PUT THAT ON THE RADAR AND TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE INFORMATION THAT IS ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE TO THEM- IF THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT SERIOUSLY PURSUING THIS CAREER SO I THINK WE ARE WE ARE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POOLS OF INDIVIDUALS HERE- I DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THAT CDC WOULD BE ABOUT THE WORD OF THE YEAR SOFT SOURCE WHEN IT COMES TO. INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT CREDENTIALING AND LICENSING BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE ALREADY ONLINE PLATFORMS THAT ARE ARE GEARED TOWARDS THAT BROADER AUDIENCE TO EXPERIENCE THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS THAT WE HAD ACTUALLY PURSUING THIS TYPE FINE.WRITING JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- TAKES ON ON ON WHAT THAT PROBLEMS THAT THE SEAT IS CURRENTLY FACING IS RIGHT NOW. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION AND I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT I. MADE AND THAT IS A DRAFT SO I APOLOGIZE ON THAT FRONT OUR FAULT- THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR THE C. D. C. WAS. VERY INTERESTING LAST- I KNOW OUR COMMITTEE HEARING YESTERDAY TO HEAR THAT ONE O THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE IN RECRUITMENT STAFFING. IS DUE TO THE COST OF HOUSING IN THE AREA WOULD YOU MIND SHARING WITH THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE FOR TEACHER RECRUITMENT AT THIS TIME- IN YOUR- IN YOUR-IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION. AND I GUESS A FOLLOW UP AS WELL THIS IS THE- HAVE ANY DATA THE REGION TEACHERS. THE REASON- WHAT ARE THE LARGEST AIR STRIPS FOR A- FRIEDMAN AT THE MOMENT I THINK THAT IT'S HARD TO SAY IN A CODE MOMENT EXACTLY- UNICODE HAS HAS REALLY PUT A STRAIN ON EVERYTHING- THAT WE'RE FACING I BELIEVE THAT- WE ARE SEEN INCREASES IN APPLICATIONS GOOD. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN TEACHING- SO IS SO THAT YOU KNOW ALREADY SOME OF THE NARRATIVE IN THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CANDIDATES TO COMPLETE PREPARATION PROGRAMS. THE RESIDENCY GRANT WORK HI IS CREATING A WHOLE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT SUPPORTS CANDIDATES WHO ARE LOCALLY RECRUITED AS AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. INSIDE OF CORPORATE TEACHERS CLASSROOM WHILE THEY COMPLETE THEIR CREDENTIAL WORKING WITH A LOCAL TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM THESE KINDS OF RECRUITMENT EFFORTS ARE PROVING TO BE. VERY IMPORTANT SUBSTANTIVE- INVESTMENTS IN OUR IN SUPPORTING PEOPLE COMING IN. THAT THE RECENT- EFFORTS TO REDUCE BARRIERS FOR ENTRY INTO TEACHER PREPARATION AB ONE THIRTY LAST YEAR. I HAVE REALLY I THINK ALSO HELP TO CHANGE SOME OF THE NARRATIVE ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO GET INTO TEACHING. BY ALLOWING A GREATER- MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS TO DEMONSTRATE BASIC SKILLS COMPETENCE FOR INSTANCE WHERE SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCE THESE ARE GOING TO BE. OF I THINK BERRIER REDUCERS FOR THE POPULATIONS TEACHERS WHO MIGHT WANT TO COME INTO TEACHING- AND IT BECOMES MORE INVITING- IN MANY WAYS WHEN SOME OF THESE BARRIERS ARE REMOVED AND WHEN THEIR SUPPORT. AND GOOD POSITIVE NARRATIVE IN THE FIELD ABOUT WHY TEACH I THINK THE OTHER T. INVESTMENT THAT'S BEING PROPOSED AS THE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC OUTREACH. TO HELP. TO AMPLIFY REALLY THE WORK THAT THE COMMISSION INTENDS TO DO WITH DEVELOPING ITS WEBSITE IN ITS CAREER COUNSELOR- AND INFORMATION CAMPAIGN HERE. ARE WORKING WITH THE CENTER FOR TEACHING CAREERS AND AMPLIFYING THE- THE KIND OF THE MESSAGING. AROUND WHY TEACH. ONE OF THE THINGS WE ABOUT ON. SYSTEM TRIP MANY MANY MAY TV PEOPLE ARE COMPLETE COLLEGE LOOKING FOR WHAT CAN I DO TO CONTRIBUTE- AND THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REASONS PEOPLE ELECT TO COME INTO TEACHING SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE- WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES HERE TO AMPLIFY THAT AND COORDINATE OUR EFFORTS TO REACH OUT AND GET THAT. WE DO HAVE INFORMATION AS TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION. OUR IN OUR DATA SETS I THINK THIS IS PRIMARILY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHERE THE HIGHEST- MAKE THE COUNTIES WITH THE LARGEST DEMAND AND FORTY TEACHERS EVERY YEAR WE GET A REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT. PROJECTS EXPECTED HIRES FOR THE COMING YEAR AND THAT- THERE ARE TOP TEN COUNTIES OF DEBT THAT ARE LISTED IN THAT IN THAT DATA AND ON OUR DASHBOARD YOU'D BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP AND GIVE YOU. THAT INFORMATION NOW. AT A LATER DATE YOUR QUESTION. THEN I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- HERE AND FIRST IS FOR THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING- WE LAST YEAR BOUGHT IN THESE HEARINGS ASKED ABOUT. OUR TEACHER SUPPLY AND THERE WAS A LAG IN STATISTICS AND SO WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT HOW THE PANDEMIC HAD AFFECTED TEACHER SUPPLY AND I HEARD YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR PRESENTATION AND THEY WERE IN MANY WAYS- SPEAKING TO HOW. ARE SOME TIME PERIODS ADMIN SHORTENED HER THINGS HAD BEEN HAPPENED TO MOVE PEOPLE LAND BUT IF YOU STAND BACK AND LOOK AT THE GLOBAL ISSUE OF TEACHER SUPPLY HOW COULD YOU EXPLAIN THOSE STATISTICS AND WHAT IT TELLS US IS THERE STILL. A SHORTAGE PEOPLE COMING INTO THAT EXPEDITE PEOPLE BUT DIDN'T ADDRESS SOME BASIC SHORTAGE ISSUES COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT AGO WHEN WE CLOSED EVERYTHING DOWN. IN THE EARLY STAGES OF COVERT NINETEEN OF WE RAN INTO AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM ND I THINK WE DISCUSSED THIS PERHAPS LAST YEAR AT A BUDGET HEARING AS WELL BUT THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE DID WAS TESTING OF ALL THINGS. THAT WE COULD NOT EITHER- ALLOW THE COHORT OF TEACHERS WHO WERE ENROLLED IN TEACHER PREPARATION TO COMPLETE THEIR PREPARATION AS OF MARCH OF LAST YEAR THEY COULDN'T GET ACCESS TO TESTING CENTERS TO TAKE THEIR FINAL EXAMINATIONS- IF THEY COULDN'T GET ACCESS TO CLASSROOMS TO COMPLETE THEIR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS- STUDENT TEACHING. OPPORTUNITIES SO THE WORK FOR SERVICE IN PREPARATION AND ABOUT TO BE CREDENTIAL WAS STUCK. AND ANYONE WHO IS SEEKING TO APPLY FOR ENTRY INTO TEACHER PREPARATION AT THAT TIME WAS ALSO STRUCK BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T TAKE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS THE BASIC SKILLS TEST WHERE THAT THE SUBJECT MATTER TESTS. THE TESTING BECAME THE BARRIER THAT THAT FROZE OUR PIPELINE RIGHT THEN AND THERE AND SO WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS I WAS AND WE WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO GET THIS DONE. OF FIRST OFF WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT REMOVED TESTING IS AN ENTRANCE REQUIREMENT FOR PREPARATION. OF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ADD TO BE ADMITTED TO PREPARATION WITH THE PROVISO THAT THEY COMPLETE THEIR BASIC SKILLS AND SUBJECT MATTER BEFORE THEY GET THEIR CREDENTIAL BUT IT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO ENTER PREPARATION. IN TWENTY OF TWENTY- INTERN OF PEOPLE. PRINT USING WORSE. ORDER ALSO ALLOWED INSTRUCTIONAL COMPETENCE ASSESSMENT WHICH THEY NEEDED SAKE IN  TESTING CENTER. SO THEY CAN DEFERRED FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS GET THEIR PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL AND BEGIN TEACHING. A COMPLETE THAT WITHIN THE FIVE YEARS THAT THEY NEEDED TO EARN THEIR CLEAR TEACHING CREDENTIAL. SIMILARLY WITH THE TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE A CLASSROOM WHERE THEY CAN. THEY CAN DO THE WORK THAT'S NECESSARY TO ASSEMBLE THE MATERIALS FOR THAT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT. WITHOUT A CLASSROOM MANY WEAK MANY INNOVATIONS EMERGED IN THAT MOMENT WHERE WE LOOK AT HOW CAN ONLINE LEARNING SO YOU KNOW SUBSTITUTE FOR IN CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE THAT WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THAT. BUT DEFERRING THOSE ASSESSMENTS ENABLE THAT POPULATION TO GET IN. TWO OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION BE AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR- YES AS TEACHERS. THESE WERE VERY IMPORTANT SHIFTS HERE I APPRECIATE HOW IMPORTANT DOES WORK I'M STILL TRYING TO GET A PICTURE OF WHAT THE GLOBAL SITUATION IS. A. N. N. A. N. IF IT'S JUST AT THE DATA CAN'T TELL YOU THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW BECAUSE- IF YOU JUST GOT ALL THIS RAW DATA THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU. ANY WAY TO BREAK DOWN. THE HOUSE SOME PEOPLE WERE EXPEDITED HOW THEY WEREN'T A PART. REALLY OVERALL. ARE WE SEEING. MORE RETIREMENTS THAN THERE ARE NEW TEACHERS IN. CAR AND IN ROME AT SHIFTING AND PLACES THAT THAT. DICTATES A SHORTAGE I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT'S THE PERFECT BACKDROP. FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THIS ITEM. WELL THE TEST I GUESS SINCE TEST IS A BARRIER. THAT AND SOME OF THE CHANGE THAT OCCURRED LAST YEAR- IN. ENABLING FLEX AROUND THIS TESTING REQUIREMENTS SHOULD HELP BUT THE FACT THAT- WE SAW A 15% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TEACHING CREDENTIALS WE WERE ABLE THE ISSUE. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR WHICH IS WHAT I SHARED EARLIER- IT. SUGGESTIVE ADDED ON ON UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT FOR THAT IS THAT A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR BECAUSE COVERED REALLY DEPRESSED AT AND OVERALL WE'RE STILL. REALLY HAVING A SHORTAGE AND NOT PROCESSING AS MANY PEOPLE AS ROOF RETIRING I'M TRYING TO LOOK FOR THE OVERALL SHARON TAX. SO SUMMARY AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THESE ARE IT REGARDING DECATUR'S AT THIS POINT INDICATORS THAT WE NEED TO GO DEEPER AND WE NEED TO DO DEEPER WORK TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT. WERE THE ROOT CAUSES THAT ENABLE MORE PEOPLE TO COME AND GET CREDENTIALS THAN BEFORE WE HAVE A STRONG SUSPICION THAT LAMINATING TESTING. BARRIERS FOR ENTRY AND FOR EXIT. HELPED IN THE AND GAVE US 15% MORE LAST YEAR THAN WE THAN WE HAVE THE PRIOR YEAR- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE SEE I'M STILL NOT UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT FOR THAT I THINK. I'M SORT OF GATHERING I'M NOT GOING TO GET IT RIGHT NOW SO LET ME JUST MAKE CLEAR STATEMENT. THAT THAT. WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S THESE PROPOSALS FOR WAIVERS AND OTHER THINGS. WHAT'S OUR OVERALL SITUATION OR MANY MORE TEACHERS RETIRING THAT ARE COMING IN WAS THE BOB DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER AND THE PROBLEM MADE MORE ACUTE BY THE PANDEMIC. ARE SO THAT WE KNOW THAT ONE WERE ASKING BEING ASKED TO SUPPORT FINANCIAL WE- ARE THINGS THAT EXPEDITE TEACHERS WERE CONVINCED TEACHERS TO COME IN MIKE HAVE CHOSEN TEACHING OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT AGAINST THE GLOBAL PROBLEM OF THE SENATE IF IT TURNS OUT. YOU DON'T KEEP THOSE TO STATISTICS IN THE RIGHT WAY WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO DOES OR HOW TO DISTILL THEM OR HOW TO GET THERE BUT THAT'S- THE THAT'S THE I THINK THE ISSUE FOR US WELL LET ME. GIVE YOU JUST ONE MORE THING BEFORE YOU DO SENATOR THERE BUT IN TERMS OF RETIREMENTS WE DON'T HAVE THOSE DATA THAT CASTERS DOES LAST YEAR THERE WAS A PROJECTED- NUMBER SIXTEEN THOUSAND POSSIBLE RETIREMENTS THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE ACTUALLY SAW BASED ON CASTERS DATA ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. TEACHERS WE WE'VE SEEN- WE'RE SEEING- OF HOLES IN OF THE TEACHING POPULATION HOW MANY OF YOU ARE TEACHERS ARE PLANNING TO STAY. OR LEAVE THE PROFESSION AND THOSE NUMBERS DURING THIS YEAR OF RE OPENING SCHOOLS- ARE ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE IT COULD BE AS MANY AS 21% OF THE TEACHERS AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE SURVEYED SAID I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN STAND THIS FOR ANOTHER YEAR. BUT THIS YEAR HAS BEEN VOLATILE IN THAT RESPECT AND YOU NEVER RESPECT SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT SIR THAT'S ALL WE DON'T KNOW OKAY. THAT'S HAPPENING. JOHNSON WITH THE STATUS THIS YEAR TO. AS HE IS- WON ME ARE THEM BE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT READY NOW US SINCE THE CREDENTIALING ONLY HAS PART OF THE ISSUE IT'S PEOPLE COMING IN OR OR STOPPING WITH CREDENTIALS AND THERE'S NOT THE RETIREMENT INFORMATION DO YOU MONITOR THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES TOWARD THIS QUESTION OF WHERE WE ARE. ON TEACHER SUPPLY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATE EARLIER IT'S I THINK THIS IS- A QUINTESSENTIAL QUESTION WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHING ISSUES TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S- THE TEACHER SUPPLY LOOKS LIKE COMPARED TO THE DEMANDS I DON'T THINK JUST GIVEN THE AVAILABLE TO SEE DATA WE'VE EVER HAD A GOOD GRASP OF THAT INFORMATION. AND WE USUALLY DO LOOK AT INDICATORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY- WAIVERS AND PRETEND AND- AND URGENCY CREDENTIALS ARE ISSUED FROM YEAR TO YEAR WE CAN USUALLY LOOK ADDS- HOW OLD DAY NUMBER OF NEWLY ISSUED CREDENTIALS COMPARES TO THE PROJECTED. NUMBER OF ESTIMATED HIGHER IS THAT DISTRICTS ARE ASKING FOR ANY YEAR TO YEAR BASIS- BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T TYPICALLY HAVE AN EASY GO TO WHEN IT COMES TO ASSESSING WHAT AND I TEACHER SHORTAGES LOOK LIKE OR WHETHER OR NOT. THERE IS A TEACHER SHORTAGE OR AN OVERSUPPLY AND I THINK PART OF THAT ADDITIONAL COMPLICATION WITH. DATA RECENT YEARS IS JUST BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC WILL BE SHORT LASTING OR LONG LASTING I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE CHALLENGES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO IT THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA. BUT THEY'RE ALSO ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED TO- SORT OF THAT THE VERY SPECIFIC AS CHANGING COULD NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND FROM A GLOBAL CONTACTS WHETHER OR NOT. DISTRICTS HAVE ACCESS TO. FULLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS THAT THEY NEED TO FOR THE CLASSROOMS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK IT JUST GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT. THAT WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS AND IF HAVING A SENSE OF THIS WOULD GOVERN OF POLIY ACTIONS WE WOULD WANT TO TAKE. LET ME ASK. ONE QUESTION AND A NEW. ARENA TO THE OF FINDING AND TO THE- COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. OUR BIG YOU MENTIONED OUT EFFORTS CAREER COUNSELORS AND ROADSHOW BARGAIN I WERE AT A RECEPTION LAST NIGHT AND I MET SOMEBODY FROM SOME NONPROFIT THAT.

MAX AND THEIR RECORD AFTER IT UNTIL IF THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR NATIONAL POPULATIONS NEED TO BE TARGETED FOR MORE INTENSE ABOUT REACHED. THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE DOES PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR THAT TO OCCUR AND IN THOSE INSTANCES THE COMMISSION WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION AROUND WIDELY SPECIAL TARGETING WAS NEEDED IN THE BI ANNUAL REPORT THAT IS DUE TO FINANCE. AND THIS INVESTMENT IS INTENDED TO BE FLEXIBLE SO THAT THE PBLIC OUT REACH CAN BE RESPONSIVE AS AS NEED THE BALL AND AN ALTERNATE OVER TO THE COMMISSION TO EXPAND IF NECESSARY UPON SOME OF THE EFFORT THEY ARE UNDERTAKING IN THIS AREA MASSLESS WHAT'S THE COMMISSION YOU HAVE ANY.

AND WAS AT NAVARETTE FROM THE CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND WILL GROW IN THAT ORDER. AND WELCOME MISS KACU FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF. I KNOW FOR THE FIRST DAY IN HANOI DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO PREPARE CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE FOR TWO SPECIFIC FIELDS PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE FIRST IS FOR- ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND OF WHICH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. FIFTY MILLION IS FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND FIFTY MILLION THIS FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE DESPITE HEALTHCARE FOCUSED VOCATIONAL PATHWAYS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM WILL BE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO DEVELOP PATHWAYS FOCUSED ON LOCAL PROGRAMS INTENDED TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE AND CARE HEALTH CARE AND CARA CONNIE WORK FORCE NEEDS. THE SECOND IS FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE CC AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TEACHER CREDENTIALING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. THIS WILL BUILD ON A PILOT PROGRAM AND ALLOW FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLABORATIVES THEY'LL OFFER THE OFFERING OF TEACHER CREDENTIAL COURSEWORK REMOTELY. MY COLLEAGUE JEN COCULA WHO COVERS ADULT EDUCATION ISSUES AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OF APPRECIATE THAT WILL MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU PAUL STATE HOUSE AND WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE. CALLED FIRST TALK ABOUT THE ADULT EDUCATION. PROGRAM PROPOSED PROPOSAL AS THE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. THAT YOUJUST HEARD ABOUT AND THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PARTNERSHIP. PROGRAM SO ON ADULT EDUCATION YOU KNOW THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARD JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO ABOUT HOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT. HAD DECLINED NOTABLY- AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. WELL IN A MOMENT IN ADULT EDUCATION WHICH FOCUSES ON PRE COLLEGIATE LEVEL- INSTRUCTION AND WORKFORCE TRAINING. HAS ACTUALLY DECLINED EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY. AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES ON PAGES SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGH THEIR ADULT SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE NON CREDIT PROGRAMS. SERVED ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE THIRD FEWER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS COMPARED WITH OTHER NUMBER THEY WERE SERVING BEFORE THE PANDEMIC OCCURRED. AND BASED ON PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ADULT EDUCATION ROMAN IS RECOVERING SLIGHTLY AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUT PROVIDERS ARE STILL WELL BELOW- SERVING THE PRE PANDEMIC LEVEL OF STUDENTS. NO IN. HAS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY PROVIDERS THAT ARE FUNDED BY ADULT EDUCATION CATEGORICAL PROGRAM HAVE NOT SEEN A REDUCTION IN THEIR FUNDING AND THAT'S BECAUSE STATUTE PROVIDES OF THOSE PROVIDERS FUNDED BY THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM- THEM OUT- WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR REGARDLESS OF THEIR ENROLLMENT LEVEL SO THEY JUST IT'S A SET AMOUNT KIND OF BLOCK. A SET AMOUNT THAT GOES OUT TO THESE- ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS. AS A RESULT- ADULT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY KERR COLLEGE IS LIKELY WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY NEXT YEAR TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS AND ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE CLASSES. IN VOCATIONAL COURSES SUCH AS HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS. OF MR HANAUER MENTIONED. THEY'RE GONNA THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE CAPACITY AND THUS DON'T NEED AN AUGMENTATION AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. SO WE JUST RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD REDIRECT THE FUNDS TO HIGHER PRIORITY PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PURPOSES. ON THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PARTNERSHIP. AS YOU JANET NOTES ON PAGE SEVENTEEN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PROVIDED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ONE TIME FOR THREE- PILOT GRANT PROGRAMS IN. THE GRANT WAS SET UP TO ALLOW ITS FIERY TEACHERS WHO ALREADY HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. TO DRIVE TO A PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THERE THE STUDENT WOULD SET IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSROOM OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE COMPUTER LAB AND TAKE ONLINE. TEACHER PREPARATION COURSE WORK THROUGH A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OR OTHER UNIVERSITY TEACHING PROGRAM. SO THESE ARE NOT CALIFORNIA MAKE COLLEGE STUDENTS THEIR STUDENTS OF A POST BACCALAUREATE TEACHER PREP PROGRAM. NOW STATUTE REQUIRES OUR OFFICE TO EVALUATE THESE THREE PROGRAMS OTHER CURRENTLY BEING FUNDED. PART IS DUE TO ALLEGED BY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO BUT A YEAR FROM NOW. AS FAR AS THE PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- TO ADD ANOTHER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- WE THINK IT WOULD BE PREMATURE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE MORE GRANT FUNDING AND REMOVE IT AS A PILOT. BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE'S HAD A CHANCE TO. REVIEW THIS INITIATIVE AND THIS PROGRAM MODEL. NO THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE GIVEN HOW MUCH THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE LEGISLATURE ORIGINALLY CREATED AND FUNDED THIS PILOT. YOU KNOW NOWADAYS WITH ONLINE CLASSES TAKEN. FROM HOME IS UBIQUITOUS AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC GIVEN THE STATE'S SIGNIFICANT- INVESTMENT IN FREE LAPTOPS FOR STUDENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE- TO INCREASE ACCESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO THE INTERNET. SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE HOLD OFF IN THE BUDGET YEAR ON FINDING ANOTHER ROUND OF THESE GRANTS UNTIL LEGISLATURE HAS A CHANCE TO LEARN MORE. ABOUT THE NEED FOR FUTURE PREPARATION- ABOUT THE NEED FOR TEACHER PREPARATION STUDENTS ARE TAKING ONLINE UNIVERSITY CLASSES AT A- COMMUNITY COLLEGE- CLASSROOM AT UNITY COLLEGE LOCATION. AND WE HOPE ARE VERY POOR OFFICE IS REQUIRED TO DO NEXT YEAR I WILL HELP THE LEGISLATURE ITS REVIEW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH NORMAL TO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE CANDLE IS THAT WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CALIFORNIA IN COLLEGE- TRANSFER STUDENTS. IN TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OR CSU AVERAGE 65% OVER THE PAST DECADE GIVEN THIS CONTEXT DATA THE CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGES IN THE CSU ARE NATURAL PARTNERS IN TEACHER PREPARATION PATHWAYS. AS WAS MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING A COLLEGE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROGRAM IS LIMITED IN SCOPE AND WAS DEVELOPED PRIOR TO THE HEALTH PANDEMIC TO BUILD ON THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FOCUS ON RURAL COMMUNITIES OR COMMUNITIES WITH LIMITED TO NO ACCESS TO SEE ISSUES- AND ESPECIALLY TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS. THE PROGRAMS JUST COMPLETED A ONE YEAR PLANNING PHASE ON THIS FALL WHILE IT'S EARLY TO HAVE EACH AND AN ACHIEVEMENT MEASURES THE THREE DISTRICTS OFFERING THE PILOTS RIVER. THE COLLEGE AND MONTEREY PENINSULA COLLEGE REMAIN ON TRACK TO SERVE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS PER SITE THE PROGRAM IS SERVING CANDIDATES WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE- HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT ARE TEACHING OR HAVE LIMITED CREDENTIAL- THE- OFFERINGS- IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH THE GOAL OF KEEPING THEM THERE- TO SERVE AGAIN. A RURAL COMMUNITIES AND OUR STUDENTS THAT HAVE A LIMITED ACCESS TO TEACHERS WE CONTINUE TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS IN THE YEAR AHEAD HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A TO THE PANEL. THIS WOULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO ASK ANY. QUESTIONS DO I HAVE ANY. SENATOR MEN. SURE TO RELATED- YEAH I THOUGHT THAT THE A. O. COMMA WERE VERY AND I I'M WANT TO DATE HEAR WHAT THE- AND IF I. RESPONSIVE BE TO THOSE. AND DINNER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- DOESN'T A POINT OF CLARIFCATION PROPOSALS- OR FOR BOESER. HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO THIS BUT YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT DAILY- RECOMMENDED THAT WE- REJECT THE ADULT EDUCATION ISSUES AS WELL AS THE TEA I THINK THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING- NOT I THINK. IT WAS REJECTING BOTH THE RIGHT. THE. YEAH I DON'T EDUCATION ONLY RESIDE NOW YEAH IN PARTICULAR THE BILL THAT PIECE. THANK YOU IDENTIFY CALLING. SIX O'CLOCK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF. I'M CENTER MEN I'LL DO MY BEST TO KIND OF FIRST JUST OF THE- SOME OF THE COMMENTS IN JUST REALLY- AT THE SIZE THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM- THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM IS REALLY TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS. THAT THE STATE IS FACING WHICH HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHILE ALSO PROVIDING UPSKILLING AN EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY OPPORTUNITIES PARTICULARLY FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. HOPE EXPAND YOU KNOW DIVERSITY IN THIS WORK FORCE AREA- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S REALLY THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM AND WE AND WE STRIVE TO REALLY- YOU KNOW HAD HANDLED THIS ISSUE- AND- YEAH DO YOU HAVE. I MEAN I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I GUESS MY CONCERN THAT THE L. A. OVER HAS RAISED IS. THAT YOU'RE JUST THROWING MONEY INTO A PROGRAM WITHOUT A LOT OF- FORESIGHT OR THOUGHTFULNESS. AND THAT THAT DOES RAISE REAL CONCERNS THAT THAT THERE'S NOT A DEMAND FOR THIS. SIDE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE EXCESS CAPACITY AT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT YOU'RE ENVISIONING PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO- AND SO JUST AS I REYES SIMILAR COMMENTS AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE FIRST ISSUE. YOU KNOW I AM WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY DATA TO SUGGEST. THAT THE ALEJO'S CONCERNS ARE MISPLACED. THAT THERE IS NOT A CAPACITY EXCESS THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT ENROLLMENT.THAT BAD DO YOU HAVE SOME BASIS FOR SAYING. THAT THIS PROGRAM THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET AT A ALLOCATION. WILL ACTUALLY SERVE THE PURPOSES THAT YOU INTENDED TO SIR LIKE WE ALL WE WANT MORE HEALTHCARE WORKERS RIGHT NOW THAT'S THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT- BY. JUST THROWING A BUNCH OF MONEY AT A PROBLEM DOESN'T MAKE IT ACTUALLY GET FIXED AND SO I'M I'M WONDERING SAID WHAT WHAT THE RATIONALE IS. SPECIFICALLY RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE L. A. L. OKAY SO- TO KIND OF ADDRESS WE ARE MONITORING THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS WITH US AT THIS CURRENT TIME- BUT WE ARE THAT IS SOMETHING. WE'RE TRACKING- HOWEVER YOU KNOW THESE FUNDS IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE REALLY TO ESTABLISH- THESE TYPES OF OR OR EXPAND FEES VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS- AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY CAN BEGIN. YOU KNOW BY NOW. EXCUSE ME IF I CAN ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION I THINK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO CLARIFY. IS WHAT GOES TO ALL ADULT EDUCATION NOW. AND WHAT IS BEING ADDED AND WHAT IS BIG TARGETED FOR THE ADDITIONS SO THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE THE THING IS THAT. ARE I STRONGLY. SUPPORT ADULT EDUCATION FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BECAUSE IT. ALLOWS SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES DON'T. ARM BUT FOR THE HEALTH. WORKER OF SERIES I KNOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE BETTER POSITIONED TO DO THAT SO I'M TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND WHAT'S DONE NOW WHAT WITH THIS ADDED WHY YOU DECIDED TO DO. IT HERE AND NOT TO HELP WORK WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR- OR OTHER THINGS SO. IT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW. WHAT'S BE GIVEN TO A EDUCATION NOW AND HOW THE SAID. YEAH SO- SO THE CURRENT- EDUCATION PROGRAM RECEIVES- SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- AND THEN THIS INVESTMENT WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON TOP OF THAT- SO THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS- ALLOCATED PUTA WITH WITHIN THE CONSORT OF THE ADULT EDUCATION WILL BE CALLED THE CONSORTIUM. SO THEY WILL DISPERSE THE FINES- YOU KNOW BASED ON THEIR OWN CALCULATIONS THAT THEY USE- THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- AND THEY REALLY WORK WORK BUG THROUGH BY A VALUE WAITING THEIR OWN REGIONAL NEEDS TO KIND OF PROVIDE THE TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THAT THAT REGION WILL BE ME. THANK YOU- ME JUST THAT GIVE FOCUS TO CENTER MAN QUEST BECAUSE- IF. WE'RE GIVING SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND THERE'S DECLINING ENROLLMENT. THIS IS PROPOSING TO ADD SO HOW DECLINING ENROLLMENT IS THIS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN ARE THEY THE APPROPRIATE ONES TO DO I HINK THEY ARE FOR THE-ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE FOR. OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS NECESSARILY HOW HOW IS THIS JUSTIFIED GIVEN THE ENROLLMENT AND WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO PUT ALL OF IT FOR ADULT EDUCATION NOT SEGMENTS AND IF I MIGHT ADD JUST ONE FOLLOW UP YOU HAVE LIKE A HAT WHAT WAS THAT Y. ONE THIRTY Y. NOT ONE FIFTY ONE NOT NINETY SO WHAT WAS THE BASIS FOR THAT NUMBER. OKAY BUT I KIND OF THINK OF YOU ANSWER THE FIRST PART THEY'LL START TO GET TO THE SECOND I DON'T THINK OF IT THE SECOND WORK ON THE- LET'S SEE WHAT YOU BETTER ANSWER QUICKLY SO THAT YOU CAN CUT OUT THIS BY. OF THIS SIDE CONVERSATION HERE BEST ADDRESS US. YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS QUESTIONS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW SO FOR THE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS REALLY WITH IN THE AVAILABLE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES- AND THEN TO KIND OF. ADDRESS THE- THE QUESTIONS AREN'T YOU KNOW. THIS MAKING SENSE WITHIN THE GRAND SCHEME OF BUT- EDUCATION SO THIS IS ACTUALLY A COMPONENT OF THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR CARE ECONOMY WORKFORCE PACKAGE THAT REALLY. DISNEY THAT REALLY SERVES TO CREATE MORE INNOVATIVE AND ACCESSIBLE OPPORTUNITIES TO RECRUIT TRAIN HIGHER AND ADVANCED AND ETHNICALLY AND CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKFORCE WITH IMPROVE DIVERSITY WAGES AND HEALTH EQUITY OUTCOMES. AND I FEEL LIKE- YOU KNOW IS- WHERE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS ON ADDRESSING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS IS REALLY THE KEY COMPONENT OF THIS. PARTICULAR INVESTMENT BUT WELL. THIS IS YOU IS THIS YOUR STATEMENT THIS IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED BY THIS HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS GOING DR JON MUCH RIGHT NOW. WELL A AND I WAS GONNA ASK VOTE IT MIGHT TAKE YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT THE WHAT ONE THIRTY MILLION AS WE HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY AVAILABLE SO WE'RE JUST GONNA TOSS IT IN. WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANY KIND OF ANALYSIS OF THE DEMAND FOR THIS THIS THIS FUNDING. BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE MONITORING IT BUT I'VE NOT HEARD YET AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE HARSH BUT- I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD A JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY THIS FUNDING IS NEEDED. AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY RESPONSE PARTICULARLY TO THE ALEJO'S CONCERNS ABOUT DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AN ACCESS WITH THIS PART OF FUNDS- SO. IT MIGHT TAKE A CORRECTLY THAT WE JUST THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION. THAT YOU TOOK A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION JUST BECAUSE IT WAS THERE OR IS THERE SOME KIND OF MAN THAT YOU SAW THAT. YOU JUSTIFY THIS PARTICULAR NUMBER. I AM WHEN WITH THE OF FLYING. SO FOR THE- FOR THE L. A. O.'S. STATEMENT ON ON THE DECLINING. WITH THE DOLLAR. PROGRAM IT IT IS TRUE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW TRENDS OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY EXACERBATED BY THE COCA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AT THIS TIME WE'RE STILL MONITORING THAT TIME WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT BUT- WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE CURRENT ADULT EDUCATION- ALLOCATION MODEL OR THE APPROPRIATION AT THIS TIME I THINK WE- WE THINK- CHANGES THAT WOULD. WOULD BE PREMATURE- AND THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION THAT'S FOR THAT'S PROPOSED FOR THIS PROGRAM- IT'S AS MY COLLEAGUE- CHEN MENTIONED IT'S TO ADDRESS. HEALTHCARE SHORTAGES WHILE ALSO PROVIDING. UPSKILLING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS- INTO. A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION IT'S INTENDED TO BE SPENT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD KIND OF. SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'LL SEE WITH YOU KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MENTIONING. EARLIER DURING THIS HEARING- IT'S INTENDED TO BE SEED FUNDING TO HELP. THESE PROGRAMS WHERE. YOU KNOW. EXPENDITURES LIKE EQUIPMENT- YOU KNOW MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR- YOU KNOW- FOR. FORCE OF THESE HEALTH BOOKING AND OR- I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE I AYE BUT I TAKE IT THAT YOU. TO THE TO THE CORK I ASK ABOUT TEN MIN AGO. I DO HAVE A RESPONSE THEY ALEJO'S CONCERNS THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY NEED THIS FUNDING AND YOU HAVE A BASIS FOR THAT I TAKE IT THE ANSWERS AT THIS TIME YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY. DATA THAT WOULD SUGGEST THIS FUNDING IS NEEDED. YEAH I THINK. WE ARE TRYING TO. INDICATE THAT THE EXISTING APPROPRIATIONS FOR ADULT EDUCATION. IS NEEDED FOR THAT FOR THE PURPOSE FOR THE- FOR THE CURRENT ADULT LEARNERS IN THE STATE. I'M AND I WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION AT THIS TIME TO YOU KNOW- INSIST THAT THEY USE THEIR EXISTING APPROPRIATIONS- FOR THIS ADDITIVE PURPOSE OF THESE HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS- ARE JUST MAKE A COMMENT. AFTER THIS. I JUST THINK THERE WAS A DISCONNECT. IN THIS CONVERSATION A. N. A. N. A. IT'S AMAZING THAT WERE THE ONES THAT WANT. TO BE THE ANALYTICAL ONES. YEAH YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE WERE LOVE TO- J. DO THIS BUT I THINK. THE ROAD- THE REAL QUESTION IS WITH THE EXISTING FINANCES ARE THOSE BEING ADEQUATE SPENT. HER DOES INCLUDE THE NEED BEING MET FROM THAT. OF PATRICK WE WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND THEN BASED ON THAT ANALYSIS WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY AFTER THAT AND I STILL THINK. THERE'S AN UNANSWERED QUESTION ABOUT WHY COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN'T DO THE HEALTH WORKER PART AS OPPOSED TO THE- ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER PARK SO. I'M JUST GOING TO. SURRENDER ON THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING AND EXPECT WE'VE GOTTEN AS FAR AS WE'RE GOING TO GET SO WE SHOULD JUST. DECLARE THAT THOSE ARE OUR CONCERNS AND WE HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE DATA. OR SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSES THEM CLEARLY BEFORE WE GET TO BACK. OUR THERE ANY ADDITIONAL. ON THE SIDE. I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE IS JUST TIRED OUT. THIS IS A SO OF ME THANK THIS PANEL WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. AND AND THAT COMPLETES OUR CONSIDERATION OF- OF THE FIVE ISSUES AND WERE PREPARED TO MOVE TO A PUBLIC COMMENT.
