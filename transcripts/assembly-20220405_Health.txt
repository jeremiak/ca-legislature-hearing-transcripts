THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS. GREAT I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY EXERCISING A WORKERS RIGHT TO STRIKE SHOULD NOT MEAN RISKING THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILIES. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY ENSURES THAT IN THE RARE CASES WHERE LABOR DISPUTES GO ON LONG ENOUGH TO JEOPARDIZE THEIR EMPLOYER FUNDED HEALTH COVERAGE WRECKING THAT STRIKING WORKERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. ALTHOUGH AFFORDABLE COVERAGE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUAL WORKERS WHO LOSE BENEFITS DUE TO A LABOR DISPUTE BEING IS FOR FAMILY COVERAGE CAN COST AS MUCH AS THIRTY OR 40% OF THE FAMILY'S INCOME. IN FACT JUST TODAY THE VICE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED IT IS DIRECTING THE U. S. TREASURY TO INTRODUCE REGULATION TO FIX THIS FAMILY GLITCH. ADDITION TO COST CONCERNS WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES MUST WAIT UNTIL THE FIRST OF THE NEXT MONTH TO BE COVERED THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA THIS MEANS THERE WILL BE A GAP IN COVERAGE LEAVING FAMILIES WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE FOR WEEKS. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER WHAT THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN IS DONE FOR THOSE ON UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT PROVIDES PREMIUM SUBSIDIES AND COST SHARING ASSISTANCE AS IF THE WORKERS INCOME WAS JUST OVER THE MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY LEVEL. INCLUDING ZERO PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND FIVE DOLLAR COPAYS AND ELIMINATES THE ANY WAITING PERIOD ASSOCIATE WAS SIGNING UP FOR COVER CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE A TESTIFIED SUPPORT R. B. K.

THE BIGGEST AND RICHEST HOTEL COMPANIES IN THE WORLD ULTIMATELY AGREED TO THE WORKERS DEMANDS FOR HIGHER WAGES. STRONGER HEALTHCARE BETTER WORKLOAD AND IMPROVE THEIR JOB SECURITY. BUT ONLY AFTER THAT- WORKERS HAD TO STRIKE- IN OAKLAND WE WERE ON STRIKE FOR THIRTY DAYS- BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT OUR HEALTH CARE IS STRUCTURED NO ONE LOS HEALTHCARE. AS A RESULT OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN MERIAH STRIKE. BUT IF THEY WOULD HAVE HAD. THAT THAT LOSS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED FOR WORKERS AND ALSO THEIR FAMILIES. WORKERS WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HEALTHCARE. IN FOOD OR RENT A MAJOR HEALTH EVENT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN WORKERS GOING INTO THAT. OUR MEMBERS ARE LOW WAGE WORKERS LACK OF COVERAGE IS THE RESULT OF A STRIKE COULD BE DEVASTATING. NO WORKER WHO GOES ON STRIKE SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE- HEALTH INSURANCE WEAPONIZE AGAINST THEM.

WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL- I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND OPERATIONAL THINGS THAT NEED TO BE IRONED OUT BEFORE SOMETHING LIKE THIS. CAN BE PUT INTO A FACT AND- WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND- THE SPONSORS. ABOUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT YOU KNOW MOVING FOR WE CAN WORK SOME OF THOSE OUT BUT- HE NEEDS TO BE POINTED OUT YOU KNOW- EMPLOYEES THAT DO YOU LOSE THEIR COVERAGE- IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ALREADY QUALIFY FOR SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD AND WITH THIS BILL TRIES TO DO. IS DESIGN A DIFFERENT BENEFIT PACKAGE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES- AS OPPOSED TO- YOU KNOW EMPLOYEES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IN INDIVIDUALS IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO. THAT'S ONE ISSUE BUT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF LIKE THE- NUTS AND BOLTS OF IT ON. YOU KNOW THERE ARE OPERATIONAL AND TIMING ISSUES LIKE FOR INSTANCE OUR MEMBERS- ARE CURRENTLY FILING THEIR BENEFIT DESIGNSIN RATE FILINGS WITH STATE REGULATORS AS WE SPEAK. IN FACT APRIL FIRST AS WAS ONE OF THE DEADLINE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE. OF COURSE LEGISLATIVE CALENDARS WRITING ON A DIFFERENT RAIL IN SO- YOU KNOW IF THIS BILLS ENACTED LATER IN THE YEAR- YOU KNOW THAT PUTS OUR MEMBERS IN A BIND SO YOU KNOW WE DISCUSS THAT WITH SPONSORS AS WELL- WE DO BELIEVE THERE. THERE ARE SOME INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE ACA IN TERMS OF THE SOLUTION IN THIS BILL TO FIX THE QUOTE UNQUOTE FAMILY GLITCH- YOU KNOW FEDERAL SUBSIDIES CAN ONLY BE USED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOT OTHERS. SO I THINK THIS IS ONE WHERE STATE FUNDING MIGHT BE REQUIRED AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'D- LIKE TO TALK TO THE- YOU KNOW THIS. THIS BILL ABOUT AS WELL- SO THOSE ARE KIND OF OUR ISSUES AND AGAIN YOU KNOW- THIS SOMETHING THAT.

ANOTHER SUPPORTER OUR SECOND WITNESS OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR INDULGENCE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS B. K. WHY I'M AN OPERATOR FROM THE CHEVRON REFINERY IN RICHMOND I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF THE U. S. W. FIVE. WITH MEMBERS ARE ON STRIKE AT THIS TIME. WE WILL STRIKE TRY TO GET A FAIR CONTRACT FOR- OUR MEMBERSHIP. I WOULD BE WORKING HARD. FOR SEVENTY DAYS TO TRY TO OBTAIN THIS CONTRACT. WITH NO SUCCESS. RECENTLY ABOUT TWO DAYS AGO WE LOST OUR HEALTHCARE. NEWS YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE IS A LIFELINE FOR WORKING PEOPLE. NO WORKER SHOULD BE SHOULD LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE OUR HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THE FAMILY AS A RESULT OF CORPORATIONS WEAPONIZE IT AGAINST THOSE OF US WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO GET A FAIR CONTRACT. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AGO IT. WE'VE SEEN HOW IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE IS. AND THIS TIME NOT ONLY MY MEMBERS CAN AFFORD TO LOSE IT. OF THE LEGISLATOR IN THE GOVERNMENT HAVE PROVIDED CRITICAL PROTECTION. FOR PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS THIS LAST YEAR BY INSURANCE STRIKING THE LOCKED OUT WORKERS CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO LIFE SAVING HEALTHCARE AND EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS. THE WORKERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. RIGHT NOW WORKERS ARE FED UP AND MORE FRUSTRATED NEVER. WE'VE SEEN THE COMPANIES WILL NOT PROTECT US. SOMETIMES AS IN THE CASE OF MY UNION RIGHT NOW RICHMAN. WORKERS MUST STRIKE. IN A SUCH A PRO WORKER STATUS CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS OUR BACK. WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY. TO PROTECT THE FAMILIES AND BILL CALIFORNIA COMMITMENT TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OVERALL. WE BELIEVE WITHOUT PROTECTION ON HEALTHCARE. THAT OUR MEMBERS MAY NOT STAND UP LIKE THEY SHOULD AND FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS THAT THEY DESERVE. OUR FOR THEIR PIECE OF AMERICAN PIE. WE BELIEVE THAT IS ONE MORE THING THAT COULD DETER THEM FROM STANDING UP WHEN THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. THE HEALTH. THEIR LIVELIHOOD. AND THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS IF WE CAN REMOVE THAT ONE SECTION OUT OF IT MAYBE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL GO BACK TO OUR REGULAR FILE ORDER. A ROUGH. NEXT PRESENTER IS DR ARAMBULA. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY DOCTOR AMBULANCE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THE BILL AND I AM PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ENSURES THAT PATIENTS WHO ARE DENIED COVERAGE OF CRITICAL MEDICATIONS. CAN HELP THEIR APPEALS REVIEWED BY A PHYSICIAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THEIR CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ALSO ADDS DATA COLLECTION MEASURES TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF STEP THERAPY AND HEALTH CARE SEVEN ESTABLISHED A PROCESS WHERE PHYSICIANS COULD REQUEST INSURANCE COMPANIES COVER THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE FOR THEIR PATIENTS. THESE REQUESTS ARE TYPICALLY REVIEWED BY A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WITH OUT THE SAME QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATIENT'S PHYSICIAN. THIS MEANS THAT THOSE WHO ARE MAKING THE INITIAL NOT FULLY GRASP THE- PHYSICIAN'S MEDICAL ARGUMENTS AND CURRENTLY IF THE INITIAL REQUEST IS DENIED THE PHYSICIANS APPEAL OF THE DENIAL CAN SIMILARLY BE REVIEWED BY AN INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT% SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE MEDICAL CONDITION. THIS PROCESS IS HUGELY WAITED AGAINST PATIENTS AND CAN LEAD TO PROLONGED PAIN AND SUFFERING. FOR REFERENCE I'M COLLEGES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE MULTIPLE YEARS OF ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND SPECIALIZATION TO DIAGNOSE AND PRESCRIBE DRUGS TO TREAT CANCER PATIENTS AND SO MANY OTHERS WITH COMPLICATED ILLNESSES A FAIR REVIEW OF THEIR APPEALS. THIS BILL REQUIRES A PHYSICIAN OF THE SAME OR SIMILAR SPECIALTY TO REVIEW THEIR CASE AND THE MEDICAL ARGUMENTS WHICH ARE BEING MADE. I'M JOINED HERE TODAY BY STEVEN SCHULTZ FROM THE ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION AND TIM MADDEN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY ALLIANCE I THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TO CONTROL SOME DIRECTOR STATE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION AND CO SPONSOR OF AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY I SEE HERE- PROUD TO REPRESENT THE FIVE POINT SEVEN. MILLION PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WANTED THEY COULD START DURING THE WAR A FURTHER TRYING TO STREAMLINE IT AND ADD TRANSPARENCY TO THE UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AFTER THE RECENT NACHMAN OF AB THREE FOUR SEVEN- WHICH HAD THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS MEMBERS. I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THE PIECE OF AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO REALLY GATHER INFORMATION ON HOW UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS SUCH STEP THERAPY AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION ARE BEING. USED AS YOU MAY RECALL PRIVATIZATIONS USUALLY JUST THE STEP THAT. HELPING TO PUT IN PLACE TO REALLY CHECK IF SOMETHING'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY- AND STEP THERAPY IS THE PROCESS THAT. HEALTH PLANS USE THAT. REQUIRE A PATIENT TO TRY A MEDICATION BEFORE I TRY AND FAIL A MEDICATION FOR- STEPPING ARE FEELING THEIR WAY- TO ANOTHER MEDICATION OFTEN TIMES THE ONE THAT'S PRESCRIBED BY. THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER- THIS LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY WILL PAINT A BETTER PICTURE OF HOW UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS. ARGUES SUCH AS HOW OFTEN STEP THERAPY AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUEST OR DENIED AND FOR WHAT REASONS ARE BEING DENIED- AS A LEGISLATURE AND DEPARTMENTS THAT. ARE OFTEN CONSIDERING LEGISLATION AROUND THIS TOPIC- IN REGULATING- THIS TOPIC. I WOULD ASSUME THAT THIS WOULD BE GREAT INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO HELP- STAKEHOLDERS LEGISLATORS REGULATORS- BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB IN. FUTURE LEGISLATION AROUND THIS TOPIC A SIMILAR TRANSPARENCY PIECE- OF. COMMITTEE LAST YEAR- AND WE HOPE THAT THE SLIGHT CHANGE THAT WAS MADE. IN THE LANGUAGE TO REALLY. GO FROM REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT COMPILED THIS INFORMATION AND- COMPLETE REPORT TO SOMETHING WHERE IT'S MORE OPTION OR TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX- FOR THE- DEPARTMENTS TO USE. IS MORE PALATABLE FOR BOTH PARTIES THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. I THINK CHAIR MEMBERS DEMAND REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY ALLIANCE AND WE ARE ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY. I'M I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE PORTION OF THE BILL TO DEAL WITH HAVING A CLINICAL PEER REVIEW APPEALS. I DON'T THINK IT'S READ STATED ANY BETTER THAN WHAT DOCTOR EMILY DID. FOR RHEUMATOLOGISTS IS NOT UNCOMMON WHEN WE'RE APPEALING A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OR STEP THERAPY EXCEPTION REQUEST. THEY HAD THE REVIEWING PHYSICIAN AT THE PAYER. BE A CARDIOLOGISTS WORD BE TRAINED IN- A STATURE EXCERPT OF GYNECOLOGY. SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE RHEUMATOLOGY SO IT MAKES THAT CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF WHY WE FEEL THAT THIS APPEAL SHOULD BE GRANTED THAT. MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WE FEEL THIS IS AN FOR PROVISION THEY'LL HELP PAGE. ENSURE THEY GET THE- THEY NEED IN A MORE TIMELY. FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD AND. YOU'RE GONNA COME TO THE TABLE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEFF HAMPTON WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS A REGRETTABLY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY WHICH REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO REDESIGN THEIR UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROCESSES REQUIRE THAT THE NILES OF THE STEP THERAPY CEPTION REQUEST FOR CERTAIN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS REVIEWED BY CLINICAL PIER. WITHIN THE SAME SPECIALTY DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR- THE SPONSORS AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO DATE ON THIS BILL. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT TO MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SUCH AS PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND STEP THERAPY. A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TOOLS USED BY HEALTH PLANS TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS RECEIVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY MEDICAL CARE. WHILE ALSO ENSURING PATIENT SAFETY AND CONTROLLING HEALTHCARE COSTS. SPECIFICALLY STEP THERAPY PROTOCOLS ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY. BY ENCOURAGING PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS UNDERTAKEN MORE EVIDENCE BASED. MEASURE APPROACH TO TREATMENT THAT IS TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL. BY GAUGING A PATIENT'S RESPONSE TO LESS HARMFUL MEDICATIONS BEFORE GRADUATING. MORE POTENT HIGH RISK DRUGS. STEP THERAPY ALSO INSURERS THE HEALTH PLANS ARE GOOD STEWARDS OF PREMIUM DOLLARS PAID BY THE EMPLOYER IN THE ENROLLEES BY REQUIRING DRUG THERAPY FOR A MEDICAL CONDITION- TO BEGIN WITH THE SAFEST AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE DRUG BEFORE PROGRESSING TO THE OTHER MORE COSTLY THERAPIES- CURRENTLY EXISTING LAW ALLOWS ENROLLEES AND PROVIDERS TO REQUEST AN EXCEPTION TO HELP PLAN STEP- P. PROTOCOLS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG. HEALTH PLANS MUST RESPOND TO THIS WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR SEVENTY TWO HOURS DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE. UNFORTUNATELY WE BELIEVE AS WRITTEN THE AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY REMIND THESE EXISTING PROCESSES BY CREATING NEW ONEROUS CLINICAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR SPECIFIED DRUGS DESPITE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT ENSURE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE DELIVERY OF QUALITY HEALTHCARE. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL WOULD CREATE A ADMINISTRATIVELY CUMBERSOME THE POTENTIALLY COSTLY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON HEALTH PLANS. DESPITE EXISTING CHALLENGES ON CURRENT DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS. I WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE COMMITTEE- AMENDMENTS- ARE OUT AND POTENTIALLY MAY DEAL WITH THE KIND OF CLINICAL PEER REVIEW PROCESS. WE'VE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THE LANGUAGE THAT SPECIFICALLY- BUT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING ANALYZING THE AMENDMENTS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OUR MEMBER HEALTH PLANS- BUT HOWEVER- SPEAKING TO THAT THE BILL PRINTS OUT WE ARE OPPOSED AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY. AND THE FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORITIES MEASURE. THANK YOU. SEARCH OUR MEMBERS SEVENTY WALKEN'S ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- ACCO MUST MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS WE ARE CONCERNED- ABOUT THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THE ONEROUS AND COSTLY REQUIREMENT IN ADDITION TO NO TIME FRAMES ON THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO WHILE IT IS LIMITED TO THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTING THE INFORMATION THERE'S NO ACTUAL TIME LIMIT FOR WHICH WE WOULD HAVE TO HOUSE STORE IN COAL THAT POTENTIAL INFORMATION.

RAYS OF THE FOOT AND ANKLE THEY WOULD NEED AT LEAST A CALIFORNIA X. RAY TECHNICIAN. LIMITED PERMIT WITH EITHER THE EXTREMITIES CATEGORY OR A LEDGE WE ADDRESS CATEGORY. HOWEVER THERE ARE NO SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA WHO OFFER THIS PERMIT. THIS IS WHAT A DIRE SHORTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST IN PERFORMING X. RAYS. AND PODIATRIC OFFICES WHICH CREATES A SITUATION THAT HARMS INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP PRACTICES ABILITY PROVIDE PROPER CARE RESULT IN X. RAYS EITHER NOT BE PERFORMED BEFORE TO OUTSIDE CENTERS WERE OTHER INFERIOR MODALITIES BEING EMPLOYED. THIS ULTIMATE DANGERS THE PUBLIC. THE REPORT. DR SURPRISE MEDICINE CANNOT FIND X.

AND WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING IN IN THE PODIATRIC OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE. THAT IS THE INABILITY TO FIND AN EMPLOYER QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM LIMITED X. RAYS OF THE FOOT AND ANKLE. ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND PUT AFTER MEDICINE. ONLY ABOUT 20% OF OUR PATIENTS REQUIRE AN EXTRA. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES THE USE OF PLAIN X. RAYS USING A TYPE OF DIGITAL EQUIPMENT WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO THE FOOT AND ANKLE. AND WHICH HAS BUILT IN SAFETY FEATURES. MANY OF THE COMMON PATHOLOGIES WE TREAT INCLUDING TRAUMA INFECTION PRE AND POST SURGICAL CARE ALL REQUIRE AN IMMEDIATE. X. RAY READ TO DETERMINE PROPER TREATMENT. FAILURE TO OBTAIN THAT IMMEDIATE READ CAN DIRECTLY AFFECT THE TRAJECTORY OF THESE PATHOLOGIES. WITHOUT QUALIFIED STAFF AVAILABLE TO ASSIST US. THE REALITY OF TIME MANAGEMENT IN MOST OFFICES MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR PODIATRISTS TO TAKE OUR OWN EX RACE. THIS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE CERTIFIED BY THAT REGULATION HEALTH BRANCH AS RADIOLOGY SUPERVISORS AND OPERATORS OURSELVES. THE REALITY IS THAT THESE ACTUALLY STUDIES ARE EITHER IMPORTED ENTIRELY OR SENT ON TO TERTIARY FACILITIES WITH THE RESULTANT DELAY IN CARE RECEIVE IMMEDIATE CARE THAT THEY NEED BUT AFTER SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM TECHNICIANS TO PERFORM THE IN OFFICE X. RAY THESE INDIVIDUALS OR PODIA ETTRICK MEDICAL ASSISTANTS. ARE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TECHNICIANS WHO PERFORM X. RAYS IN THAT THEIR PRIMARY DUTY IS CHAIR SIDE ASSISTING. WELL FOOT ANKLE X. RAYS ARE A SECONDARY DUTY. FOR DECADES PRIOR TO TWENTY THIRTEEN OUR EXISTING PODIA ETTRICK MEDICAL ASSISTANTS WHO WISH TO INCREASE THEIR SKILLS. WOULD TAKE IN AVAILABLE COURSE IN RADIATION TECHNIQUE AND SAFETY. THIS WAS OFFERED OVER SEVERAL WEEKENDS. AFTER PASSING THE REQUIRED TEST WHICH WAS SPECIFIC THE PARTY AFTER MEDICINE. THEY WERE AWARDED A CERTIFICATION BY THE RADIOLOGIC HEALTH BRANCH. MANY OF OUR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TOOK THIS COURSE ANDINCREASE THEIR VALUE TO OUR PRACTICES. AND THEIR BY THEIR SALARIES AS WELL. BUT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE REGULATION THAT ALLOWED THIS WAS REMOVED. THE ABILITY TO BECOME EDUCATED AS LAKE PARTY OUT TRICK. X. P. IS NO LONGER EXISTS THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA OFFERING OR WILLING TO OFFER COURSES. IN THE SPECIFIC LEG PARTY AFTER COURT CATEGORY. ALSO NOW THOSE LIKE PUT AFTER TAXIS WHO DID TAKE THAT COURSE IN THE PAST. HAVE BEEN LOST TO ATTRITION. IN FACT ONLY HANDFUL REMAINING CALIFORNIA THIS IS CREATED A CRISIS FOR WHICH WE HAVE COME TO YOU OR SOLUTION TODAY. IT COULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD THAT A CERTIFIED EXTREMITY AND XTC SUCH AS ONE WHO MIGHT WORK FOR AN ORTHOPEDIC GROUP. COULD BE EMPLOYED HERE HOWEVER EVEN IGNORING THE FINANCIAL REALITIES THEY COMMAND MUCH HIGHER SALARIES THIS WOULD BE AN ERROR. THOSE EXTREMITY XTC UNDERSTANDABLY ELECT TO PRACTICE FULL SCOPE. ALMOST SOLELY AS RADIOLOGY TAX NOT AS PRIMARILY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE SIMPLY PUT THE PM'S CANNOT FIND XTC WERE WILLING TO WORK IN A PARTY AFTER OFFICE. I'LL CONTINUE THEN SO SIMPLY PUT AGAIN D. PM'S CANNOT FIND EXCUSE ARE WILLING TO WORK IN A PARTY THAT TOOK OFFICE AND PERFORM ONLY FOOT AND ANKLE RADIOGRAPHY THEY JUST DO NOT EXIST. TO REMOVE EXISTING BARRIERS TO EDUCATION AND TO ACCOMMODATE THE SPECIALIZED PUT AFTER EXITING WE NEED TO SAFELY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED AND APPROVED TECHNICIANS BY ADDRESSING OUTDATED IMPEDIMENTS THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION WHICH HAD BECOME A DE FACTO PROHIBITION. WE ARE SEEKING A SOLUTION THAT WILL ENABLE THESE INDIVIDUALS THESE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PARTICULARLY THOSE ALREADY WORKING AT A PARTY AFTER GO OFFICE TO BE FURTHER TRAINED AND PERMITTED TO PERFORM X.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND THEIR STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND WE ARE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AB EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO WILL SET THE REIMBURSEMENT FLOOR FOR RECESSION ORTHOPEDIC APPLIANCES TO BE AT LEAST 80% OF THE PREVAILING MEDICARE ALLOWABLE RATE EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO SHARES OF THE SOCIALLY VULNERABLE MEDICAL POPULATION WILL BENEFIT FROM IMPROVED ACCESS TO CRITICAL CARE. LEADING TO INDEPENDENT PRODUCTIVE LIVES WITH THE SAME TIME DECREASE THE IMPACT OF MORE EXPENSIVE CARE AND SERVICES IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WITHOUT A REASONABLE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY RATE. SOCIALLY VULNERABLE PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE STRUGGLED ACCESS OF CARE AN ONGOING SUFFER AND MOBILITY WHICH ULTIMATELY LEAVE pTO. FURTHER HEALTH ISSUES HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT WITH ME TODAY IS SPENCER GREEN PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC AND PROSTHETIC ASSOCIATION AND RODNEY HARRISON A MEDIC CAL A. B. D. AND HOPE YOU. PATIENTS THEM. THANK MISS FLOOR- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS SPENCER GREEN I'M A CERTIFIED PROSTITUTES TO AN ORTHOPEDIST OF EIGHTEEN YEARS REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR HANGER CLINIC THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA OR THOUGHT I CAN PROSTHETIC ASSOCIATION I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO. OR THE TESTS AND PROCESSES TREAT PATIENTS WITH DEFORMED DYSFUNCTIONAL AND MISSING LIMBS. THIS IS A VULNERABLE POPULATION CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING AN AND THE ACCESS TO CARE CRISIS FOR THOSE IN NEED ORTHODONTIC PROSTHETIC DEVICES. I'M REMINDED OF A MEDICARE BENEFICIARY IN BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA- THROUGH PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING EXPERIENCED PHYSICALCHANGES AND NO LONGER FIT IN HER PROSTHESIS AUTHORIZE A NEW PROPERLY FITTING DEVICE SHE SPENT FOUR MONTHS WAITING TO HOLD HER NEWBORN BABY WHILE STANDING UP. THESE CRITICAL DEVICES PROVIDE INDEPENDENCE MOBILITY AND SAFETY. TEN YEARS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S DATA SHOWS THAT THE NUMBER OF MEDICARE ALL BENEFICIARIES NEEDING OR THOUGHT I CAN PROSPECT OF VICES IS EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING WHILE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS IS NOWHERE NEAR KEEPING PACE. THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE AS THE MEDICAL PROGRAM EXPANDS. THE AVERAGE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOUGHT IT CAN PROSTHETIC DEVICES IS 51% OF CURRENT CURRENT MEDICARE. NATIONALLY MEDICAID PAYMENTS AVERAGE 75% OF CURRENT MEDICARE- CALIFORNIA STATE THE PROVIDE THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON ACCESS TO CARE AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS HOWEVER WATCHING OR THOUGHT I CAN PROSTHETIC PROVIDERS TURN AWAY FROM THESE BENEFICIARIES. BECAUSE THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THESE PRODUCTS BARELY COVERS THE COST OF GOODS CHANGE THIS PROBLEM. SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PATIENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CARE WELL THE DEVICES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME ILL FITTING. THEY LEAD TO SKIN BREAKDOWN DECREASED MOBILITY. AND OTHER HEALTH COMPLICATIONS AND ILL FITTING PROSTHESIS LEADS TO INCREASED HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES COSTS TO THE STATE. WHERE'S BENEFICIARIES THE DO HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE ARE MORE MOBILE MORE CAPABLE MORE INDEPENDENT AND THEREFORE MORE LIKELY TO REJOIN THE WORKFORCE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THESE VULNERABLE MEMBERS CALIFORNIA SOCIETY BY VOTING I ON A.

I'M IF TO PUSH THE MICROPHONE BUT IT'S ON THE ON YOUR LEFT. WELCOME TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE A LITTLE DIFFERENT WHEN I WAS IN THIS ROOM YESTERDAY SO. THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN VERSE. I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN TWENTY NINE. A BILL TO PROVIDE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION SERVICES THAT HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE AT STOPPING CYCLES OF GUN VIOLENCE AND SAVING LIVES. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS INTENSIFIED THE COUNTRY'S GUN VIOLENCE CRISIS. RECORD INCREASES IN GUN SALES SOCIAL COVER PEOPLE AT INCREASED RISK OF GUN VIOLENCE. TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR SOME OF THE DEADLIEST YEARS ON RECORD FOR UNITED STATES. IN JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WE EXPERIENCE YET ANOTHER HORRIFIC INCIDENT OF GUN VIOLENCE JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS VERY HEARING ROOM. THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE NOT ENOUGH WE MUST ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE HEAD ON NOT ONLY IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE BUT ALSO AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS HAVE SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES BUT PATIENTS ARE USUALLY DISCHARGED BACK INTO THE SAME CONDITIONS. THAT LED TO THEIR VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS CREATES A REVOLVING DOOR OF VIOLENT INDUSTRY A VIOLENT INJURY AND TRAUMA CENTERS TO OFTEN SEE THE SAME VICTIMS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AB NINETEEN TWENTY NINE ADDRESSES THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY THAT FAR TOO MANY VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR A RE INJURY. AND RETALIATION AND WE LEVERAGES FEDERAL MEDICAID DOLLARS TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAM. FOR EVIDENCE BASED VIOLENCE PREVENTION SERVICES THAT PROMOTE RECOVERY AND REDUCE THE RISK OF RE ENTRY. LIKE THE CURRENT PANDEMIC THE GUN VIOLENCE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS DEMANDS THAT WE TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT THOSE MOST AT RISK. BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO VIOLENCE PREVENTION SERVICES AB NINETEEN TWENTY NINE WILL SAVE LIVES. REDUCE BURDENS ON THE MEDICAL AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS AND ADDRESS TROUBLING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND COMMUNITY VIOLENCE OUTCOMES. THAT'S WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF GUN VIOLENCE IN PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING GIFFORDS MOMS DEMAND ACTION THE BRADY CAMPAIGN'S EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS NURSES. PEDIATRIC PACKED PRACTITIONERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT ARE GABRIEL GARCIA POLICY AND ADVOCACY DIRECTOR YOUTH ALIVE IN KINDRED SIMONS DIRECTOR FRONTLINE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AT THE HEALTH ALLIANCE FOR VIOLENCE INTERVENTION. THANK YOU AND WHEN YOU HAVE A QUORUM AND EMOTION I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY SIR. PUSH THE BUTTON THERE IF YOU DON'T MIND. GREAT THANK YOU CAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS GABRIEL GARCIA AND I'M THE POLICY AND ADVOCACY DIRECTOR FOR YOU TO LIVE WHERE CAN YOU BASED ORGANIZATION IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA THAT FOCUSES ON VIOLENCE PREVENTION. INTERVENTION AND HEALING. GOT THIS PANDEMIC WE'VESEEN- STORED INCREASES AND GUN VIOLENCE. AND AS MUCH AS HOMICIDE HAS BEEN A LEADINGCAUSE OF DEATH ACROSS THE UNITED STATES IT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG BLACK MEN UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY FOUR. SO THIS CRISIS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE GOT THE PANDEMIC THAT'S WHY WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH. THAT INCLUDES A COHERENT PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY TO ADDRESS AND REDUCE VIOLENCE ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN TWENTY NINE. WHICH WOULD CREATE A COMMUNITY VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND RECOVERY PROGRAM THROUGH OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM. WE KNOW THIS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES ALREADY PROPOSING TO DO THIS I DO A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER BENEFIT THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS PROPOSED INVESTING OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND- IN ADDITION TO THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS STOOD ON THE ROSE GARDEN ALMOST A YEAR AGO TODAY. AND CALLED FOR STATES TO FIND VIOLENCE PREVENTION THROUGH THEIR MEDICAID SYSTEMS AND THAT VERY SAME EVENT ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND SAID IN THE ROSE GARDEN. AND MENTIONED THE HOSPITAL BASED VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM THAT WAS CREATED IN OAKLAND BY YOUTH ALIVE AS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING AND REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE. REALLY PROUD OF THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT IS BASED OFF OF THE EXPERIENCES OF OUR COMMUNITIES HERE IN OAKLAND. WE'VE SEEN THESE S. SUCCESSFUL RESULTS REPRODUCE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THIS INTERNATIONAL MODEL OF HOSPITAL BASED. VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION. SO FOR US RECOGNIZING THE PATH THAT WE'VE GOTTEN TO INTRODUCE AND CREATE THIS LEGISLATION WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR AYE VOTE. WHEN THERE'S A QUORUM ESTABLISHED AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON. WHAT. GOOD AFTERNOON. HAS BEEN A VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS ARE THE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES OFFERED TO SURVIVORS OF COMMITTING VIOLENCE AT HOSPITAL BEDSIDE WELL THEY'RE STARTING THEIR JOURNEY TO HEALING. THE CONCEPT OF H. VIPS WAS DEVELOPED INDIVIDUAL SHERMAN SPEARS WHO IS A SURVIVOR OF GUN VIOLENCE HIMSELF. THE ONE THING THAT STOOD OUT FOR SHERMAN DURING HIS INITIAL HEALING PHASE WAS THAT THERE WERE NOT PEOPLE AROUND HIM THAT COULD RELATE TO HIS EXPERIENCE THAT COULD RELATE TO HIS TRAUMA SOMEONE THAT COULD OFFER SUPPORT FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE. VIVUS PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS. WHO WORK ON THE FRONT LINES OF H. VIPS ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT SHERMAN NEEDED. WHEN HE WAS STARTING HIS HEALING JOURNAL. AND BECAUSE THEY'RE SHERMAN H. VIPS EXIST WE NOW KNOW AND DOCUMENTED STUDIES AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE PROVEN THAT H. PHIPPS REDUCE RE INJURY RATES EVERY DEUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFECTIVE COMPONENT OF H. VIPS IS THE INCREDIBLE IS THE CREDIBILITY OF HVS AND THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE IN THE PORTAL WORK THEY ADVISE PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS DO ON THE FRONT LINES TO SUPPORT SURVIVORS OF COMMUNITY VIOLENCE YEAH WE CANNOT FORGET THAT VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS ARE ALSO SURVIVORS WITHIN THEIR HEALING JOURNEYS. AB NINETEEN TWENTY NINE WOULD ALLOW AGENCIES WHO EMPLOY VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS WHO CONTINUOUSLY BILL MEDICARE AS AN ADD A FUNDING SOURCE THIS WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO INCREASE OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROFESSIONAL SALARIES TO ACTUAL LIVABLE WAGE A ROBUST MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ALSO EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SO THEIR VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS CAN SEEK THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NEEDED. TO CONTINUE MANAGING THEIR OWN TRAUMA. WHY THEY SUPPORT SURVIVORS THE COMMUNITY VIOLENCE WHO THEY NEEDED BAD SIDE. BY THIS PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS ARE A CRUCIAL COMPONENT TO H. VIPS AND WE MUST KEEP THEM BOTH MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY SAFE TO CONTINUE TO THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT THEY DO IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE IS THERE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. C.

GOOD AFTERNOON AMY BROWN REPRESENTING THE CITY OF LONG BEACH IN SUPPORT THANK YOU NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AND MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE OF THE BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM. AT A MOTION SO- MR GABER WHICH I CLOSE I WOULD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WANT TO DIRECT MY COMMENTS TO OUR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE WHO ARE NOT DEMOCRATS- I KNOW TAT SOMETIMES WHEN WE DEAL WITH BILLS THAT RELATE TO GUN VIOLENCE THEY CAN VERY EASILY BECOME PARTISAN AND I JUST WANT TO. EMPHASIZE HERE THAT THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT WHO CAN HAVE A WEAPON UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THEY CAN HAVE A WEAPON IT SIMPLY SPEAKS TO THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN WHAT WE DO ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS. AND WE KNOW THAT 44% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS ARE LIKELY TO BECOME RE VICTIMIZED IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND SO THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BREAKING THE CYCLES OF VIOLENCE AND KEEPING THOSE PEOPLE SAFE SO I REALLY WANTED TO UNDERSCORE THAT. IN ALSO SAYS WE'RE ALREADY INVESTING MONEY IN THESE PROGRAMS WE PUT TWO HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS INTO OUR BUDGET TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS WHAT THIS SAYS IS LET'S ALSO USE MEDICARE AND IT'S A WAY WE CAN SPLIT THE COST WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SAVE RESOURCES FOR TAXPAYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE- FISCAL ANALYSIS OF A PRIOR VERSION OF THE SPELL. THAT THE COSTS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY LOW THEY'RE A MERE COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS I THINK WE CALCULATED LAST TIME THAT IF THIS BILL WERE IF THESE SERVICES WERE TO SAVE- YOU KNOW PREVENT ONE OR TWO SHOOTINGS THAT THEY WOULD PAY FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD SAVE THAT THEY'D SAVE RESOURCES FOR TAXPAYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I KNOW OFTEN ARE ARE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT GUNS BECOME PARTISAN. BUT I JUST HOBLEY SUGGESTS TO- ARE REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT COLLEAGUES THAT AT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ABOUT ABOUT SAVING LIVES ABOUT SAVING TAXPAYER RESOURCES AND IT DOESN'T GET INTO THOSE OTHER CONVERSATIONS I CAN BE MORE DIFFICULT AND WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GABRIEL THANK YOU TO WITNESSES. SEE MR HOLDEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL MR HOLDEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT WILL ENSURE THAT CHILDREN ARE PROTECTED WHILE THEY'RE AT DAY AND SUMMER CAMPS. THIS COMING SUMMER CHILDREN FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA WILL ATTEND THOUSANDS OF CAMPS. OF THESE CAMPS ONLY OVERNIGHT CAMPS ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW STATE REGULATIONS IN VIRTUALLY NONE ARE INSPECTED TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN ATTENDING. INSPECTIONS THAT ARE CARRIED OUT DO NOT FOCUS ON STAFF QUALIFICATIONS OR BACKGROUND CHECKS BUT INSTEAD ARE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED ON BUILDING AND FOOD COMPLIANCE. THE CODE INFOBANK CODE COMPLIANCE. EVEN IF CANCER FOUND TO BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SHUT DOWN UNSAFE CAMPS OR PROGRAMS. FURTHER DAY CAMPS ATTENDED BY CHILDREN WHICH CONSTITUTE THE VAST MAJORITY OF CAPS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW ANY REGULATIONS OR LAWS REGARDING CHILD SAFETY INCLUDING SEX OFFENDERS AND BACKGROUND CHECKS. THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THESE DEFICIENCIES IN CURRENT LAW BY REQUIRING CHILDREN'S CAMPS TO ADOPT BASIC SAFETY STANDARDS A REGISTER WITH THEIR COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. PUBLIC HEALTH. IT ALSO REQUIRES COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO VERIFY THE CAMPS ATTENDED BY CHILDREN ARMENIAN THOSE SAFETY STANDARDS ALSO REQUIRES THE CHILDREN CAP OPERATORS CONDUCT ANNUAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR ALL PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT STAFF. MANY ARE PREVENTABLE TRAGEDIES WE HAVE SEEN ACCOUNTS INDICATE THAT WE MUST DO MORE TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. IN THE CASE OF ROCKS THE FORBES THE SIX YEAR OLD WHO DROWNED WHILE ATTENDING A DAY CAMPING OUT TO DINNER THESE PROTECTIONS WILL BE TOO LATE. BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO PREVENT FUTURE CHILDREN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES FROM SUFFERING THIS HEARTBREAKING EXPERIENCE. HERE TODAY WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN IS DOUG FORD'S THE FATHER OF ROXY. I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT I AM COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO IMPROVE. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WILL DO SO AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. OUR STATES CAPS CAMP SAFETY REGULATIONS MUST CHANGE TO ENSURE THAT STAFF ARE FULLY QUALIFIED. INSPECTIONS MEANINGFUL ENSURE CHILD SAFETY AND PARENTS MAY REST ASSURED THAT THEIR CHILD WILL TOOK RETURN HOME SAFELY. LIKE TO THANK YOU AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND- OUR WITNESSES- TODAY MR FORBES JUSTIFY. GREAT THANK YOU MR HOLDEN AND PLEASE GO AHEAD MR FORBES. I'M SORRY THERE WE GO THERE WE GO. MY NAME IS DOUG FORD'S THIS IS MY WIFE ELENA AND MY SIX YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ROXY. SUMMER CAMP OPERATORS ADMITTED TO SHOCKING ACCIDENT KILLED ROXY. LATEST DESPAIR EVENTUALLY RAVAGED HER IMMUNE SYSTEM. SHE DIED FOUR WEEKS AGO. HE WAS ONLY FIFTY SO YOU MIGHT IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS IS FOR ME RIGHT NOW TO BE HERE. I STOOD OVER MY LIFELESS CHILD WITH HER EYES STUCK HALF OPEN PUPILS BLACK SKIN COLD AND BLUE I ADMINISTERED CPR. MY BELOVED WIFE KNOWING IT WOULDN'T WORK. BUT I PROMISED THEM THAT I WOULDN'T STOP UNTIL I PREVENTED OTHER CHILDREN FAMILIES FROM SUFFERING AS WE HAVE. I NOW RUN THE NATION'S ONLY CAMP SAFETY FOUNDATION. OUR ALLIANCES INCLUDE THE BEAU BIDEN FOUNDATION AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CALIFORNIA. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT L. A. COUNTY AMONG OTHERS. THEY KNOW WE SEEK LONG OVERDUE PROTECTION SO THAT KIDS AVOID HARM TO CAMPS NATIONWIDE. WE INTRODUCED OUR FIRST CAMP SAFETY BILL IN TWENTY TWENTY. OPPOSITION CAME FROM COUNTIES AND COUNTY HEALTH LOBBY GROUPS IN CAMP LOBBY GROUPS. ONE COUNTY OPPOSITE OPPOSITION LETTER SAID QUOTE OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS NOT EQUIPPED TO OVERSEE CHILD SAFETY AND WELLBEING. THAT COUNTY IS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INCLUDING CHILD SAFETY. THESE COUNTIES LOBBY GROUPS NO I'M NOT EQUIPPED WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I'M NOT EQUIPPED WITH THE FAMILY. AND YET I STOP AT NOTHING TO PROTECT CHILDREN A CAPS. THESE COUNTIES ESSENTIALLY ADMITTED TO YOU THEY'RE NOT EVEN A BITING THE WOEFULLY DEFICIENT TWO THOUSAND AND NINE ORGANIZED CAMP LAW. WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO ENFORCE A FEW SIMPLE SAFETY MEASURES. THIS ORGANIZED CAMP LAW ALSO STATES THAT THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA IS CORDY TRUE PROTOTYPE OF AN ORGANIZED CAMP. YET WE KNOW THE BSA'S EXECUTED THE WORST CHILD MOLESTATION CAMPAIGN IN U. S. HISTORY USING COUNTLESS CAPS. THIS IS FACTUAL HARM. THEY'RE NOT ALONE. THERE'S HARD LIKE THIRTEEN MOLESTATIONS AT THE PAINTED TURTLE CAMP ARE FOR SERIOUSLY ILL CHILDREN IN L. A. COUNTY. ARE LIKE THE MOLESTATIONS OF SIXTEEN GIRLS UNDER EIGHT SEVEN AT THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH CAMP IN SAN JOSE. ARM RIGHT HERE IN THIS CITY WITH RATES AT THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH CAMP PENDLETON. AND A DEATH AT CAMP SACRAMENTO WHICH COST TAXPAYERS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. I KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DIED OR NEARLY DIED OF FOUR DIFFERENT CAMPS FIFTEEN MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE. THIS HARM THIS KAMPAR PROCESS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY TWELVE STATES. THAT DOES NOT LICENSE DAY CAMPS AND OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THEY DO NOT COUNTIES DO NOT AFFORD MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT OF OVERNIGHT CAMPS. CALIFORNIA HIGHLY REGULATES DAY CARE OPERATIONS WITH FINGER PAINTING AND SINGALONGS. YET CALIFORNIA CAMPS HAVE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN SHOOTING LIVE ROUNDS FROM TWENTY TWO CALIBER RIFLES AND BALANCING ON ROPES A HUNDRED FEET HIGH WITHOUT STATE REQUIREMENTS THAT PROTECT THEM FROM HARM. THE STATE DOES NOT REQUIRE CERTIFICATION FOR CAMPS. TO OPERATE THOSE HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES OR REQUIRE BACKGROUND CHECKS TO PREVENT MOLESTATIONS OR EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS OR TRAINED HEALTH SUPERVISORS OR EVEN MEANINGFUL SAFETY INSPECTIONS OR LICENSES. FOR DECADES CAMP LOBBYISTS HAVE CONVINCED US THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT BUT DESPITE MY NEARLY UPON BEARABLE SUFFERING I'M HERE BECAUSE- MY SELF AND MY FOUNDATION PROTECT MILLIONS OF CHILDREN LIKE YOURS OF OUR- FOUNDATION HAS NOW SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THIS LEGISLATION. IN L. A. COUNTY WITH TEN MILLION RESIDENTS. I ASK THAT YOU JOIN THEM. AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YES IT THREE MINUTES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS LILY ANA CORONADO I SERVE ON THE BOARD OF THEM YOUNG OUT FOUNDATION THE FOUNDATION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN HONOR OF PROXY FORCE IN THIS PICTURE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MAN HOLDEN AND HIS STAFF FOR HIS TIRELESS WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND HIS LEADERSHIP. FROM I'M ALSO OF THE MOTHER OF TWO BOYS A FIVE YEAR OLD AND AN EIGHT YEAR OLD. MY EIGHT YEAR OLD WENT TO SCHOOLWITH ROXY. AND THAT IS HOW I BECAME FRIENDS WITH DOG AND ELENA- IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE- WHEN ELENA. OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BE HERE- SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND AND SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. ON HER BEHALF. AND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. TO ME THIS LEGISLATION AS THIS EMPLOYMENT SAID IT'S COMMONSENSE BASIC SAFEGUARDS FOR OUR CHILDREN. AS A PARENT IT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE HOW WE- DO NOT REGULATE OR OVERSEE DAY CAMPS BUT WE REGULATE AND OVERSEE CHILD CARE FACILITIES WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE INFANTS I REMEMBER BEING ABLE TO GO TO THE DATABASE THAT DSS AFFORD TO PARENTS TO LOOK AT COMPLAINTS AND PRIOR INCIDENTS OF- INJURY TO BE ABLE TO EXAMINE AS A PARENT. IF THE FACILITY WAS SAFE FOR MY CHILD THAT WE CAN'T DO THAT FOR CAMPS IS JUST NONSENSICAL AND THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW PARENTS A LOT MORE TRANSPARENCY AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THEIR OWN DUE DILIGENCE ABOUT CAPS- IT DOESN'T SET A CEILING IT REALLY SETS A FLOOR IT REALLY IS THE MOST BASIC- THAT WE CAN- WE CAN EXPECT FROM THE INDIVIDUALS ENTRUSTED TO CARE FOR CHILDREN WHEN MANY OF US ARE WORKING. I'M I THINK ONE THING I WANTED TO SAY AS WELL IS THAT. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW MR FORBES GAVE MANY EXAMPLES OF- INJURY AND HARM INCLUDING WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR DAUGHTER- BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE- A DATABASE OR RECORD KEEPING OR OVERSIGHT OR REGISTRATION OR EVEN LICENSING AND SO I THINK ONCE WE- DELVE INTO THIS ISSUE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THERE. THIS THE MAGNITUDE IN THE SCOPE IS FAR BEYOND WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD IMAGINE. AND SO- I WOULD ASK YOU AND URGE YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SO THAT WE CAN DO EVERYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLE TO PROTECT OUR MOST PRECIOUS CHILDREN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD AND. A MICROPHONE BUTTON THERE PLEASE OUR- THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON TERM MEMBERS MICHELLE GIBBONS AT THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE MORE HEARING RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL CHECK FIRST WANTS TO COMMEND THE GOAL THAT THE AUTHOR HAS TO CREATE AN OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT STRUCTURE FOR CHILDREN'S CAMPS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN WHILE IN THEIR CARE. WELL WE AGREE WITH THE SCHOOL. WE MUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH HOW- THE BILL SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC DEMONSTRATED WHY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS EXIST THEY EXIST TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES. I AM AT RELATED ILLNESSES AND CHRONIC DISEASES LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DO NOT HAVE EXPERTISE IN CHILD SUPERVISION AND PLACING THE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITY OF CHILDREN'S CAMPS WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL FALL SHORT OF THAT INTENDED GOAL AND WILL NOT PROVIDE A SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAMED AREAS WHERE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE FOCUSED IN AREAS WHERE WE ARE DEFICIENT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FOCUS IS ON FOOD SAFETY IS BECAUSE THAT'S AN AREA OF OUR EXPERTISE THE CHILD SUPERVISION IS NOT. WE'VE APPRECIATED THE ENGAGEMENT WITH AUTHORS OFFICE TO DATE WE CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO INSTEAD PLACE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHILDREN'S CAMPS WITH AN AGENCY WITH APPROPRIATE X. EXPERTISE AND OVERSIGHT OF ENTITIES WITH CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. CDSS CDSS HAS A COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION THAT LICENSES VARIOUS FACILITIES THAT PROVIDE CARE TO CHILDREN INCLUDING CHILD CARE FACILITIES IN FACT SOME CHILDREN'S CAMPS SUCH AS YMCA PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY LICENSED BY CDSS AS CHILD CARE FACILITIES YET THEY'VE SOUGHT LICENSURE IS DAY CAMPS DURING SCHOOL BREAKS FROM OTHER ENTITIES. CDSS HAS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN BE EXPANDED UPON TO OVERSEE CHILDREN'S CAMPS THIS INFRASTRUCTURE CONSISTS OF THREE MAIN COMPONENTS PER THEIR WEBSITE PREVENTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT. ACCORDING TO CDSS THE PREVENTION THEY CAN REDUCE PREDICTABLE HARM TO CHILDREN BY PROVIDING AN ORIENTATION PRIOR TO LICENSURE PERFORMING BACKGROUND CHECKS MAINTAINING STAFFING REQUIREMENTS HEALTH SCREENINGS PRE LICENSURE AND TRENDS AND PROVIDING INFORMATION REGARDING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THEIR COMPLIANCE CDSS INSURERS CHILDCARE FACILITIES OPERATING ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND ARE MADE AND MAINTAIN THAT THROUGH AN ANNOUNCE FACILITY INSPECTIONS COMPLAIN INVESTIGATIONS ISSUING DEFICIENCY NOTICES CONSULTATIONS AND FURTHER. LASTLY ENFORCEMENT ENFORCEMENT IS TAKEN WHEN AN ENTITY FAILS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND PERSONAL RIGHTS OF CHILDREN I WITHIN THEIR CARE AND THEY CAN DO THIS DO SO WILL. IN THE- LAW AND LEGAL ACTIONS DENIALS OF APPLICATIONS PROBATION SUSPENSION REVOCATION OF A LICENSE AND SO FORTH. THERE INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAR MORE SUITED TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN AND THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN ATTENDING DAY CAMPS WHERE IS OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS INSTEAD FOCUS ON PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS. ARE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE OPERATING OUTSIDE OF THEIR EXPERTISE AND IN ADDITION WE NEED TO. ACQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT WORK FORCE AT A TIME WHEN PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE ALREADY LOSING STAFF DUE TO A LACK OF ONGOING FUNDING AND EVEN MORE SO DUE TO BURNOUT HARASSMENT. AND THAT THREATS EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT EXPANDING THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBILITY BEYOND THE SCOPE. AND WE JUST ASK THAT YOU PLEASE PUT CHILDREN'S SAFETY FIRST AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE THAT CAN DO THAT ACCORDINGLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU X. WITH THIS PLACE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ON KATHY BURBANK AND I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION FOR USE AND I TO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR HIS OFFICE HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY. ACCOMPLISH YOUR ACCOUNT TO ACCOMPLISH. SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T DRINK LUNCH NO THAT IS A GREAT OFFER. HE IS- TO WORK WITH OUR ORGANIZATION TO TRY TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES WE HAVE BEEN OURSELVES INTERESTED IN SEEING DAY CAMPS HAVE OVERSIGHT AND IN FACT WE'VE SPONSORED A NUMBER OF BILLS ONE OF THEM VETOED BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR. THAT WOULD HAVE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE DAY CAMPS BE REGISTERED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND OVERSEEN BY THEIR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ARE UNFORTUNATELY- WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO IN TERMS OF THIS BILL UP BECAUSE THE BILL CONTAINS A LOT OF ONEROUS POSITION UP UP PROVISIONS WE NEED TO CONTINUE OUR WORK WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE TO SEE IF WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE. AND OUR ORGANIZATION IS MADE UP OF THE CHRISTIAN CAMPS THE INDEPENDENT CAMPS THE AMERICAN CAMP ASSOCIATION AND A LOT OF TRADITIONAL YOUTH SERVING ORGANIZATIONS WHO ALL WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE WE LIKE TO SEE. INPUT FROM THE CAMPS TO MAKE THEM STRONGER AND TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE SAFE THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT AND THAT'S WHAT WE ALL ARE WORKING TOWARDS SO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S TIME ON THIS AND- HAVE PLEDGED. TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WITH HIM. THANK YOU. I THINK THAT IN THIS CASE WE I HOST WE HAVE SOME TWEETERS OF WHAT WE CALL THEM SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO. COME TO THE MICROPHONE WILL ALLOW YOU TO SPECIFY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR REALLY APPRECIATE THE COURTESY I'M CHRISTINA TO CARL REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.

THESE ARE LASTING FIVE DAYS OR LONGER SOMETIMES MULTIPLE WEEKS AND SOMETIMES AN ENTIRE SUMMER THE COULD BE ROBOTICS CAMPS COMPUTER CODING CAMP SO WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THE HIGHER RISK EVENTS.

A FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR SOME IMPORTANT FOOD FOR THOUGHT AND HOW WE CAN- BRING TOGETHER SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED NOT JUSTIN. ADDRESSING THOSE OF OPPOSITION OR- CONCERN- BUT THOSE ELEMENTS OF THIS ANALYSIS THAT RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR ON OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE THAT IS MUCH MORE. PROFOUND THAN WHAT EXISTS CURRENTLY- I WILL ALSO SAY THAT- LOOK FORBES MY VIEW IS SHOWN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COURAGE. I I'M NOT SURE I COULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE'S DONE HERE TODAY- HAVING LOST TWO VERY IMPORTANT. MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY. BUT I THINK IT IS ALSO A TESTAMENT TO SAY THAT LIFE DOES GO ON.

CONCERNS I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR SOME CHANGE. AND THAT WE NEED TO. TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY.

A YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF. WE WILL CERTAINLY SIT DOWN AND ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND WITH GREAT EARNEST AND DEDICATION. SOMETHING THAT I THINK WILL BE RESPECTFUL. OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN RESPONSIVE- BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WHAT WE DO PUT IN PLACE AS THE RIGHT KIND OF. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE CAN WALK AWAY FROM AND FEEL THAT IT IS GOING TO DO WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO. IT IS NOT JUST PUTTING SOMETHING IN A BILL AND SAYING WELL. LET'S HOPE IT WORKS.

GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MISTER CHEN MEMBERS THAN HERE PERCENT AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY WHICH WILL ESTABLISH A PILOT PROGRAM FOR FIVE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT CAPACITY BUILDING FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE BILL ISUNLIKE ANY OTHER BECAUSE THAT PUTS IT PUTS THE EXPERTS CLINICIANS AND CLIENT FACING STAFF IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT OF CHANGE TO DEVELOP PRACTICES THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE CLIENT POPULATIONS MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WOMEN OF COLOR LGBTQ PLUS LOW INCOME RURAL IMMIGRANT. AND PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. FACE SOME OF THE HIGHEST WITH IN NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE PATIENTS ARE MOST CERTAINLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF MATERNAL MORTALITY THERE WILL CANCER MORTALITY STI INFECTIONS AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND EDUCATION. THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION STUDY CONDUCTED INTO OUR COUNTY FOUND THAT CULTURAL STIGMA AND ADEQUATE INTERPRETATION SERVICES AND THEY NOT MAKES OF DOMESTIC ABUSE INPATIENT RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE SOME OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO PATIENTS. LENNIX STAFF UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR PATIENTS INTERSECTING IDENTITIES IMPACT CARE BUT DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING OR SUPPORT TO ADEQUATELY RESPOND POPULOUS AND MOST EVERY STATE IN THE US THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS UNIQUELY POISED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. BECAUSE OF THIS DIVERSITY. THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH PROVIDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. WITH TEXAS AND REACHED THEM BAN ON ABORTIONS AND IMPENDING SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY REPEAL ROE VERSUS WADE THE FUTURE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS HANGS IN THE BALANCE AND NEVER BEFORE. PROJECTIONS BY THE GUTMACHER INSTITUTE INDICATE THAT CALIFORNIA COULD SEE AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE TRAVELING FROM OUT OF STATE TO SEEK REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. CALIFORNIA HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO BECOMING A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE A PERSISTING GAPS IN SERVICE IN CHRONIC UNDER RESOURCING OF OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINICS CONTINUE TO BRING IN PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS HERE IN THE STATE. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY IS JUST POOREST THE FORMER WOMEN'S FOUNDATION PHILLIES POLICY INSTITUTE ALUMNI. ENGINE NAME SERGEANT WOMEN'S FOUNDATION STUDIES POLICY INSTITUTE READING THE FELLOW. THEY MET I RESPECTFULLY ASK FROM ABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. PUSH THE BUTTON THERE SO ALL RIGHT. ITS EXAM EXCEPT IT'S NOT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBER WOULD AND HEALTH COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JUST R. AS I USE THEY THEM PRONOUNS I AM CURRENTLY THE ARTISAN RELATIONS MANAGER AT THE LITTLE MARKET I BRING FIFTEEN YEARS OF DEDICATION TO COMMUNITY BUILDING IN THE ANTI TRAFFICKING ANTI. CENTER BASED VIOLENCE MOVEMENTS I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINIC INITIATIVE FOR INITIATIVE FOR INNOVATIVE CARE PILOT PROGRAM. I AM ALSO IS ALWAYS POLICY INSTITUTE ALARMS SUCCESSFULLY PASSING MULTIPLE BILLS THAT SUPPORT CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AND SURVIVORS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. I WOULD LIKE TO USE THIS TIME TO CREATE A SHARED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE ABUSE CONTINUUM'S OF POVERTY GENDER BASED VIOLENCE HOMELESSNESS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ILLNESS THE PREGNANT PEOPLE IN MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES FACE. WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I BEGAN IDENTIFYING AS QUEER MY MOTHER OUTRIGHT REJECTED ME AND I BECAME AND HOUSE PORTABLE ALONE AND GROOMED I WAS RECRUITED BY APPEAR WITH THE PROMISE OF FOOD AND SHELTER AND THEN WAS MERCILESSLY SEX TRAFFICKED FOR THREE YEARS. EVENTUALLY A MAN THREE TIMES MY AGE AGREED TO HOUSE ME IF I AGREED TO BE HIS GIRLFRIEND UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THIS ONLY LED TO SIX YEARS OF VIOLENT TORTURE- BUT ALSO CHILD WITH THIS MAN. AS MUCH AS THE FATHER. AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE AND A LIFETIME OF DEBILITATING CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS NOW PREGNANT WITHOUT INSURANCE AND DURING SEVERE. INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. I DISCOVERED A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC PROVIDING ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WITH A SLIDING SCALE OPTION. THIS MIRACLE PROVIDED FEASIBLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND RELIEF FOR MY LIFELONG FEAR OF PUBLIC CHARGE AND POSSIBLE DEPORTATION. WHEN I MET WITH. DESPITE LIVING HERE SINCE I WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD. WHEN I MET WITH MY NURSE AN OBGYN FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS ENCOURAGED TO CARRY MY PREGNANCY TO TERM WITHOUT DISCUSSION OF ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND GIVEN STANDARDIZED INFORMATION ON WHAT TO EXPECT. IN THE COMING MONTHS I WAS SO APPRECIATIVE OF THE SERVICE AND OF ITSELF THAT I EXPECTED NOTHING MORE AND WOULD HAVE SETTLED FOR MUCH LESS. MY PARTNER MONITORED ALMOST EVERY APPOINTMENT HE OFTEN SCREAM TO BE LITTLE ME IN FRONT OF STAFF- WHILE THE STAFF PRESENT AND IN THE EXAM ROOM AND ON WHAT MORE THAN ONE OCCASION LASHED OUT AT PROVIDERS THEMSELVES. OUTSIDE OF MY PARTNER'S FAMILY THESE CLINICIANS WERE THE ONLY OTHER PEOPLE WITH WHOM I INTERFACE. HOWEVER BEYOND CHECKING MY VITALS AND THE FETAL HEART RATE NOTHING MORE WAS SAID DONE OR OFFERED. LOOKING BACK NOW I CAN RECALL DESPERATELY WISHING SOMEONE ANYONE WOULD HAVE ASKED ME ARE YOU SAFE. ARE YOU OKAY IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU WITH. I'M ESPECIALLY ON THE RARE OCCASION WHEN I WAS ALONE AND VISIBLY BATTERED- MONTHS AFTER MY CHILD WAS BORN I FINALLY CAME TO REALIZE THAT THOUGH I MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXCUSE OR ACCEPT ABUSE MY PERSONAL NORM I COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT ALLOW THIS TO BE MY CHILD'S REALITY. AND DO MY OWN AND YIELDING AND DESPERATE SEARCHING HAS FINALLY CONNECTED TO AN ORGANIZATION SERVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS THIS WAS A PIVOTAL TURNING POINT IN MY LIFE. WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU ALL TO TAKE AWAY FROM MY STORY AND I THE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS I VISITED TO HELP ME HOW MYSELF. HOW DRUMMOND FORMED REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE TRAINING COULD HAVE HELPED SCREENING FOR ABUSE SCHERING. MORE OPTIONS THAN JUST CARRYING A PREGNANCY TO TERM PROVIDING PERSONALIZED INFORMATION CARE FOR SOMEONE IN MY UNIQUE SITUATION I'M AN IMMIGRANT WITH THEIR OWN PARENTS SURVIVING. SURVIVING A LOT AND NOT JUST THE STANDARD INFO HOW CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES KIND OF HELPED ME CONNECT TO LIFESAVING ORGANIZATIONS MUCH EARLIER IN MY JOURNEY AND I WOULD NOT HAVE TO JUGGLE ALL THIS ON MY OWN AS A NEW MOM. HOW INCREASE LANGUAGE SERVICES ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHOSE LANGUAGE NEEDS. DO NOT MEET LANGUAGE THRESHOLD COULD HAVE HELPED OTHERS. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE CLINIC INITIATIVE FOR AN- INITIATIVE FOR INNOVATIVE CARE PILOT PROGRAM SEEKS TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC SETTINGS. AND HAS A TRANSFORMATIVE CAPACITY TO TRAIN PROVIDERS IDENTIFICATION. EXPENSE OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE CULTURAL EMPATHY COMMON FORM CARE SUPPORT TO PROVIDE WRAPAROUND CARE AND CASE MANAGEMENT. AS WELL AS TREND TRANSLATION SERVICES FOR THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY STRUGGLING TO ADVOCATE FOR THE CARE THEY NEED. AND WANT. GRADING MODELS FOR OTHER CLINICS FACING THE SAME LIMITATIONS TO THE STATE AND GETTING ALL PREGNANT PEOPLE THE HEALTH CARE THEY DESERVE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE I ON AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBER WOULD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS GINNY SERGEANTS AND I WILL BE READING A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR DERREN ALLARD A FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. MY NAME IS DOCTOR DERREN ALLARD AND I AM A FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN IN SANTA MARIA CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS I HAVE PROVIDED COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY CARE SERVICES INCLUDING BIRTH CONTROL COUNSELING STI SCREENING AND TREATMENT PRENATAL CARE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EDUCATION TO THIS UNDERSERVED CENTRAL COAST COMMUNITY AND HOSPITALS COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. MOBILE HEALTH UNITS AND FREE CLINICS. ALTHOUGH THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND BROUGHT THE TERM SOCIAL DETERMINANTS TO HEALTH INTO THE PUBLIC LEXICON THESE CONCEPTS ARE NOT NEW. FOR YEARS INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY LGBTQ PEOPLE IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HELPLESSNESS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE SHORTER LIFE EXPECTANCIES HIGHER INFANT MORTALITY RATES HIGHER RATES OF UNTREATED STIS AND POOR OUTCOMES WITH THEIR CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE SAFETY NETS OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FILLING A CRITICAL VOID WERE UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS MANY OF WHOM FALL INTO THE CATEGORIES I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CAN GAIN ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALTY HEALTH SERVICES THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THEIR BEST INTENTIONS THE RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE C. H. SEES ARE LIMITED BY FINANCES. IN PERSON INTERPRETING SERVICES ARE COSTLY AND OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE AND PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ARE FORCED TO WAIT ON HOLD FOR MINUTES WHILE TELL INTERPRETERS ARE CONTACTED. CUTTING INTO THE ALREADY SHORT APPOINTMENT TIME. REMOTE INTERPRETERS OFTEN MISS COMMUNITY LINK OFTEN MISS BODY LANGUAGE OR NON VERBAL CUES THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO PATIENT PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS. PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE OFTEN DRIVEN BY INDIVIDUALS RATHER THAN SYSTEMS AND DISSOLVE WITH HIGH STAFF TURNOVER. IN THE ABSENCE OF FORMAL TRAINING ON TRAUMA INFORMED CARE VICTIMS OF PAST OR PRESENT DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES LIKE SEXUAL ASSAULT INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OR HUMAN TRAFFICKING CAN INADVERTENTLY BECOME RE TRAUMATIZED MAKING IT LESS LIKELY FOR THEM TO SEEK CARE AT A CLINIC OR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN GENERAL. AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY WOULD ALLOW C. H. SEIZE TO INVEST IN THE NEEDS OF THEIR PATIENTSAND IMPROVE HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE FROM HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS. IF THE PANDEMIC HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING IT IS THAT THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY DEPENDS ON THE HEALTH OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME LEVEL SKIN COLOR CULTURAL HERITAGE GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO VOTE AYE ON AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. C.

THANK YOU ALSO TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF ESPECIALLY MISS JUDY BABCOCK FOR WORKING AND REFINING AND HELP IN THIS BILL TO BECOME BETTER. SO WE TRULY DO ACCEPT AND APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. DURING MY TIME AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. I'VE SEEN THE POTENTIAL POSITIVE IMPACT THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS CAN HAVE ON CALIFORNIANS. AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE LIVES FOR THE BETTER POSSIBLY EVEN SAVE A LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE NOT SEEN MUCH WORK TO IMPROVE THESE HOLDS SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE LANTERN ACT. WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES HOWEVER- AS A RESULT OF THE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION AS WE LOOK AROUND AND SEE THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. PROTECCI SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS BY ENSURING THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS ARE UNIFORMLY APPLIED IS A KEY STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING AND ADVOCATING FOR GRAVELY DISABLED POPULATION. WE SEE THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE SUFFERING AND NOT GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. MY BILL I BELIEVE WILL ACTUALLY HELP RESOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS. BY INCLUDING STAKEHOLDERS FROM VARIED DISCIPLINES OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. SO THAT WE CAN GATHER AND ENSURE THAT WE APPLY THE AND THE LANTERN ANAK FAIRLY ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE COLLUDING SUCH GROUPS AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HELLBOY IS. DISABILITY RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA AND EVEN MORE. OCCLUDING MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS PROCESS WILL ENSURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO BEST SERVE THOSE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF HELP. LET'S TAKE THIS STEP TOGETHER AND I HOPE THAT- YOU'LL SUPPORT THIS BILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN I LIKE TO INTRODUCE. A MAT GALLAGHER WHO IS AN ATTORNEY FOR CALAVERAS IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES FOR THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE CHRIS ROCKY WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR.

WE KNOW BASED UPON THE AUDITOR'S REPORT IN THE WORK THIS COMMITTEE IS DONE. AT THE LPS THAT ACT IS NOT BEING. APPLIED CONSISTENCY WITHIN ALL CONSISTENTLY WITHIN ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S COUNTIES. WE KNOW WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IS NOT WORKING IN THIS BILL SEEKS TO IMPROVE THAT. BY BRINGING SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TOGETHER TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES TO LOOKING GRAVELY DISABLED WHO IS A THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS AND IT. IMPLEMENTING VARIOUS OTHER MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE LPS ACT. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GO FORWARD BETTER TOGETHER. WITH THAT SAID WE RESPECTFULLY ASK pI VOTE WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE THANK YOU.

AND THIS WILL BRING SOME UNIFORMITY WHICH WE NEED- SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL WHEN WE HAVE A CHANCE. VERY WELL AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM I THINK I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT ALL DAY SO. THAT HASN'T CHANGED- THE BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION MR LACKEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST REAL BRIEFLY I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT. I'VE HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH THIS- FIFTY ONE FIFTY. INTERPRETATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT ACTUALLY ARE MENTAL HEALTH. PROVIDER SYSTEM RELIES ON A LOT OF THIS FIFTY ONE FIFTY. ONE FORSMAN. BECOMES OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSION AND IT'S NOT FAIR IT'S NOT RIGHT. AND WE NEED TO STEP FORWARD AND ACTUALLY DO IT IN A MORE MEANINGFUL. AND UNITARIANS WAY. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS NOT THE FIX ALL. BUT IT BUT IT IS ACTUALLY A STEP IN THE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION REALLY THIS CALL FOR THIS TIME SO. WE APPRECIATE THE AYE VOTE WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY COMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR LOOKING THANK YOU TO WITNESS THANK YOU. THEN WE DON'T HAVE OTHER AUTHORS PRESENT MR RODRIGUEZ ARE YOU PREPARED TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. THESE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY WHICH WOULD REQUIRE CERTAIN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTED AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO INSTALL AND MAINTAIN SIX TRAUMA KITS ON THEIR PREMISES IN ORDER TO TREAT PEOPLE IN NEED OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. DURING A DRAMATIC EMERGENCY EVENT. RESPONSE TO THE TRAGIC MASS SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A GROUP OF DOCTORS CONVENE A PANEL OF NATIONAL EXPERTS. FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TO CREATE IMPROVED RESPONSE SYSTEM DIRECTED PRIMARILY AT THE CONTROL OF LIFE THREATENING BLOOD LOSS. IN THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS THE GROUP OF EXPERTS CONCLUDED THAT BYSTANDERS IMMEDIATE RESPONDER SHOULD BE TRAINED AND EMPOWERED TO STOP HEMORRHAGE IN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES. THESE EXPERTS ALSO RECOMMEND A TRUMP COULD BE PLACED IN PUBLIC PLACES SUCH AS SHOPPING MALLS SCHOOLS SPORTS VENUES. TRANSPORTATION CENTERS ETCETERA NEXT TO E. D. RECOGNIZING THE FULL THE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN DIRECT PRESSURE THEY ALSO RECOMMENDED THE USE OF TOURNIQUETS TO CONTROL SEVERE BLEEDING. WITH MASS CASUALTY EVENTS BECOMING MORE COMMON IN TWENTY FIFTEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA LAUNCHED STOP THE BLEED CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE BYSTANDERS TO BECOME TRAINED AND EMPOWERED TO TAKE LIFESAVING ACTION WHILE EMS PERSONNEL ON ROUTE. SACRAMENTO LIKE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS NO STRANGER TO THIS DRAMATIC EMERGENCY EVENTS IN THE LAST FIVE WEEKS THERE HAVE BEEN TWO MASS SHOOTINGS THAT HAVE TAKEN THE LIVES OF TEN INNOCENT VICTIMS. DURING THESE TRAGIC EVENTS A PERSON SUFFERED FROM SEVERE BLOOD LOSS AND DIED WITHIN FIVE MINUTES FOR EVERY SECOND COUNTS. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT ASSURE OUR MEDIA RESPONDERS HAVE THE INSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO SAVE AND RENDER MERCY CARE. AT THE SCENE OF EMERGENCY. WITH THREE PROVIDE TESTIMONY.

SHE GOOD AFTERNOON I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING YOU MY NAME IS DR ANY LEOPARD I AM A TRAUMA SURGEON ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF SURGERY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO. I'M A DOUBLE BOARD CERTIFIED. GENERAL SURGEON AND THE SURGICAL CRITICAL CARE. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS THE THREE CHAPTERS. ARE IN CALIFORNIA MERCADO SURGEONS AND MYSELF. I WORK IN AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS LEVEL ONE VERIFIED DROP TRAUMA CENTER AND PROVIDE THE MOST ADVANCED AND EXPEDITED CARE TO INJURED PATIENTS. JUST AS THE LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER HERE AT UC DAVIS PROVIDED THIS LEVEL OF CARE TO THIS VERY COMMUNITY JUST A FEW SHORT DAYS AGO AND AS THEY DO EVERY DAY. THE CABBIE OUGHT TO THIS KERR SAID THE INJURED AND BLEEDING PATIENT. MUST SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH. TO ARRIVE AT THE TRAUMA CENTER BEFORE THEY HAVE DIED FROM BLEEDING OUT. WITH A% MAJOR BLEEDING INJURY IN ADULT COMPLETED DEATH WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. EVEN BEFORE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES CAN CAN ARRIVE. INJURIES TO THE ARMS LEGS AND SCALP DIMITRI WITH MINIMAL EQUIPMENT THAT IS BOTH EASY TO USE AND EASY TO TRAIN THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THIS IS A TRAUMA KIT THAT CAN ALLOW PATIENTS TO SURVIVE TRANSPORT TO THE TRAUMA CENTER. IT CONTAINS SIMPLE EQUIPMENT LIKE GLOVES AND A MASK THAT'S BLUNT TIPPED TO REMOVE CLOTHING TO ACCESS THE WOUND. GAUZE PACKING THAT DOES NOT EXPIRE. AND A VERIFIED TOURNIQUET THAT CAN BE TAUGHT TO THE PUBLIC EASILY AND SIMPLY TO SAVE LIVES. THE STOP THE BLEED PROGRAM IS SPONSORED BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS THE WHITE HOUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. IS CURRENTLY TAUGHT BY US TRAUMA SURGEONS IN THE UKRAINE TO MAXIMIZE THE SURVIVAL OF INJURY THERE. AND WHILE MANY OF THESE TECHNIQUES WERE DEVELOPED AN INITIALLY STUDIED IN A COMBAT ENVIRONMENT. THEY'RE GENERALIZABLE TO ALL SOURCES OF BLEEDING THAT OCCUR IN CIVILIAN LIFE. I HAVE TREATED PATIENTS. THAT HAVE USED TURN IT HAD IT NEEDED TOURNIQUETS ARE OTHER BLEEDING CONTROL TECHNIQUES APPLIED AFTER MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE CRASHES INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS HOME SHOP INCIDENCES AND EVEN BREAKAGE OF GLASS WINDOWS OR COFFEE TABLES NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF MAJOR VASCULAR BLEEDING INJURY. EDUCATION THE PUBLIC IS WIDESPREAD IN FREE CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE EFFORT TO REQUIRE READY AVAILABILITY OF EIGHTIES COLOCATED THESE BLEEDING CONTROL KITS WITHIN THOSE SAME CONTAINERS AND LOCATIONS MAKE THESE TOOLS ACCESSIBLE TO SAVE LIVES AND REDUCES COST. EIGHTY MANUFACTURERS EVEN ENCOURAGE THIS COLOCATION THESE KIDS ARE FORTY DOLLARS A PIECE MAKING THIS LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ALL SIX REQUIRED BY THE BILL- AND THIS IS 15% OF ONE EIGHTY MISSION COSTS. LOCAL STUDIES IN CALIFORNIA PROVES THAT THIS SAVES LIVES WITH WIDESPREAD AVAILABILITY OF THESE TOOLS AND THESE TECHNIQUES MORE LIVES WILL BE SAVED AND RESULT IN LESS BLOOD TRANSFUSION. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB TWO TO SIXTY FOR BLEEDING CONTROL KITS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED IN THE COMMUNITY TO SAVE LIVES. AND TO STOP THE BLEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT TO THE C. THIRTY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. CNN WILL GO.

IT'S ALEX KEEPS SAYING THAT OPEN WE GET A QUORUM BUT YOU KNOW HOW WE WILL AT SOME POINT SO WE CAN ENTERTAIN A MOTION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES BACKGROUND FROM ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO WITNESSES FOR I THINK YOU SHOULD. MISTER O'DONNELL. IF ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWO ZERO THREE FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN FACT ALL ALL SERVICES THAT A STUDENT MAY NEED FIRST I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY STAFF TO IMPROVE THE BILL. WE ALL KNOW HOW CRITICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE FOR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF RETURNING TO SCHOOL. FROM CODE. THE CODE LOCKDOWN IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST. HOUSING FOR ONE MINUTE WE HAVE A QUORUM WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT ALL DAY. MADAM SECRETARY TO MY MIND CHAIR YES I AM. THANK YOU THIS REMINDER HERE WALDRON AGUIAR-CURRY ARAMBULA. BIGELOW REAL. LARA. MAIENSCHEIN MAYES. MCCARTY NAZARIAN. RIVAS RODRIGUEZ. SANTIAGO KALRA. WE HAVE A QUORUM AND I DO APOLOGIZE BUT I WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT SO YOU KNOW PICK IT UP WHEREVER YOU WANNA START OVER WHATEVER YOU WANT AYE NAZARIAN FORMS ARE GOOD THING THEY ARE AND I'LL JUST PROCEED FROM AND NOW YOU HAVE A MOTION I DRIVE A SECOND- RESEARCHER. WITHOUT THE L. A. B. THE ALLEY A BILLING SYSTEM ALLOW SCHOOLS TO BE REIMBURSED FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR. SERVICES PROVIDED TO ANY MEDIC CAL ELIGIBLE PUPIL BY SCHOOL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. FOR TOO LONG A DH CS THE DH CS AUDIT PROCESS HAS BEEN A BARRIER. TO INCREASING ACCESS TO THE SCHOOL SERVICES VENTURA DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS TO RECOUP THEIR COSTS THEREFORE THEY REALLY DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM SO WE SEEK TO DATE TO TODAY. IS TO RECTIFY THAT ISSUE WITH THE HEAVY ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND PUNITIVE AUDIT FINDINGS FOR THE ALLEY A- BUILDING PROGRAM. MANY DISTRICTS OF FACE SIGNIFICANT DIS ALLOWANCES REQUIRING THEM TO RETURN A LOT OF MONEY TO THE STATE IN FACT 75% OF LDA CLAIMS AUDITED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN REQUIRED SOME LEVEL OF REPAYMENT TO THE STATE. AND DURING THAT TIME NOT A SINGLE L. EA ONE FORMAL APPEAL. SCHOOL STUDENTS TYPICALLY DO NOT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE FROM DH CS I DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY SUBMIT A CORRECTIVE PLAN ACTION PLAN TO ADDRESS AUDIT FINDINGS. REPAYING DISALLOWED CLAIMS MEANS THAT SCHOOLS ARE DIPPING INTO THEIR GENERAL FUND. TAKING FUNDING AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM AND OTHER SERVICES. THEY PROVIDE TO STUDENTS AS A RESULT SCHOOLS ARE DROPPING OUT OF THE PROGRAM ENTIRELY OR NOT BILLING FOR ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. CURRENTLY ONLY FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE ELEAZAR OR PROXIMALLY ONE HALF OF THE ALLEY IS IN CALIFORNIA. PARTICIPATE IN THE ALLEY A BROGUE BILLING PROGRAM. THIS MEANS THAT WE ARE LEAVING FEDERAL MONEY ON THE TABLE. CALIFORNIA GENERATES TWENTY NINE DOLLARS FOR MEDICAL MEDICAL WHILE MONTANA IS RECEIVING FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.PER ELIGIBLE CHILD. THESE FEDERAL DOLLARS CAREER AND REINVESTED IN OUR SCHOOLS INTO INCREASED HEALTH AND MENTAL SERVICES THEY CAN OFFSET- THE BURDEN ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE'RE IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR OFTEN COMING UP WITH THEIR OWN DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AB TWO ZERO THREE FOUR REQUIRES REFORMS TO THE AUDITING PROCESS IS BY ENSURING THAT SCHOOLS ARE REIMBURSED FOR ALL ELIGIBLE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT PRECLUDED BY LAW. FEDERAL LAW SHIFTING THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF AUDITS AND RECOUPMENT OF CLAIMS TO EASE TO TWO CASES OF FRAUD WASTE OR ABUSE. REQUIRING THE AUDIT TEAMS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO L. A.'S WITH LARGE DISALLOWANCE IS END RECORDING ARTISTS AND APPEAL PROCESS THESE TO BE COMPLETED IN A TIMELY MATTER IN OTHER WORDS THEY REALLY NEED TO EDUCATE DISTRICTS HOW TO CONDUCT THE BILLING PROCESS HOW TO PERFORM THE BILLING PROCESS. SO THEY CAN DO IT CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME AND NOT BE BURKE IN SOME TYPE AUDIT THAT HAPPENED SEVEN YEARS AFTER THAT THE ORIGINAL BILL. THESE CHANGES WILL ENCOURAGE MORE SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ALLEY BILLING PROGRAM BRING MORE FEDERAL MONEY TO THE TABLE AND ULTIMATELY INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF CRITICALLY NEEDED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. TO OUR SCHOOL CAMPUSES. I'D WITH ME HERE TODAY MISTER CHAIR IS DOCTOR MERRY ON TO ONE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND KATIE NELSON. A SCHOOL NURSE FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HOWEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST. THANK YOU HI I'M DOCTOR MERION TO ONE I AM THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CTA C. CESA AND THE SCHOOL NURSES ASSOCIATION. MY APPRECIATION TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS CRITICAL BILL THAT PRIORITIZES STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS. IN SANTA CLARA AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE STUDENT HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ARE IN CRISIS. SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC INTENTIONAL SELF HARM AMONG THIRTEEN TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS INCREASED BY NINETY ONE PERCENT. AND OVERDOSES INCREASED BY NINETY FIVE PERCENT. DIAGNOSIS OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER INCREASED BY 84% IN JUST THE LAST YEAR. IN MY COUNTY WE HAVE LAST SIX STUDENTS TO SUICIDE IN THE LAST FIFTEEN MONTHS. SCHOOLS HAVE LONG PROVIDED THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT STUDENTS NEED TO ACCESS THEIR EDUCATION. DURING THE PANDEMIC EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE TOOK ON SIGNIFICANT HEALTH ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ADDITION 95% OF SCHOOLS SPENT A PORTION OF THEIR STIMULUS FUNDING TO INCREASE ACCESS. THIS CONTINUES TO SEARCH SCHOOLS UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO CONTINUE TO FUND ON CAMPUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. HOWEVER THE ONLY ON GOING FUNDING AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THIS WORK IS THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY BILLING OPTION PROGRAM ALLEY A BOP. THE PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY PUNITIVE AUDITS ARBITRARY AND CHANGING RULES AND UNFOUNDED DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS ALL OF WHICH HAVE PREVENTED STUDENTS FROM RECEIVING CRITICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOL. ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN-DATA DH CS AUDITORS CURRENTLY. DISALLOW PORTION OF 75% OF THE ALLEY A BOB CLAIMS SUBMITTED BY SCHOOLS THIS RATE OF DISALLOWANCE IS UNPRECEDENTED UNPARALLELED IN ANY OTHER STATE OPERATING A SIMILAR PROGRAM. AND HAS REMAINED CONSTANT SENSE ON ITS BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. OR CALIFORNIA TO DRAW DOWN MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES MORE ALIGNED WITH OTHER LARGE STATES IT WOULD INCREASE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SCHOOL BASED STUDENT HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BY APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND THESE DOLLARS WOULD ENSURE THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS HAVE ONGOING FINANCIAL SUPPORT. I URGE YOU TO JOIN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND SUPPORTING AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLACE GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR.

VENDOR THAT OPERATES WITHIN THE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM DIVISION AT S. J. C. O. E. WHEN SPEAKING WITH DISTRICTS AND COMPLETING PROGRAM REVIEWS. THERE ARE SOME COMMON THEMES REGARDING THE ALLEY A MEDICAL BILLING OPTION PROGRAM I HAVE IDENTIFIED. THE FIRST BEING THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT IS THAT IT MAY CAUSE SOME ELEAZAR ESPECIALLY SMALLER DISTRICTS. I HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF SMALL OF SEVERAL SMALLER DISTRICTS RECENTLY DISCONTINUING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM. DUE TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OUTWEIGHING THE BENEFIT OF POTENTIAL INTERIM FIRST MET. WHEN AUDITS OCCUR THERE'S A HIGH POTENTIAL DISTRICTS WILL HAVE FUTURE REIMBURSEMENT WITH HELD. OR REPAYMENTS DUE TO VARIOUS REASONS LACK OF DOCUMENTATION IS TYPICALLY ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT AUDIT FINDINGS. THIS IS OFTEN DUE TO HIGH STAFF TURNOVER. FOR THE PROGRAM COORDINATOR AT THE L. A. LEVEL NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE PROGRAM. AND THE MANY REQUIREMENTS OR NOT RECEIVING ADEQUATE TRAINING AND SUPPORT. THERE'S ALSO THE REALITY THATDIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE L. EA ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE PROGRAM WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING. OF THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY THE NEW STATE PLAN AMENDMENT WAS IMPLEMENTED WHICH EXPANDED THE L. A. OPTION BILL BILLING OPTION PROGRAM. ADDING NEW PRACTITIONERS ADDITIONAL SERVICES AS WELL AS LIFTING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CLAIMS ALLOWED FOR GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. FROM TWENTY FOUR SERVICES PER STUDENT PER YEAR. TO ALLOWING FOR ALL QUALIFIED HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED TO BE CLAIMED. MANY ELEAZAR UNAWARE OF THIS EXPANSION ESPECIALLY THE ABILITY TO CLAIM FOR MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE DHS OFFERS AND FACILITATES ADVAIT ADVISORY WORK GROUP MEETINGS AND TRAININGS EVERY OTHER MONTH THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR ALTHOUGH THESE TRAININGS- MEETINGS AND TRAININGS ARE HELPFUL ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND SUPPORT IS NEEDED FOR ELLIE IS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM.

OR SOMETHING. A GUY NOW I'M HEARING THINGS THIS IS SCARY OKAY THERE'S NO DOOR OVER THERE APPARENTLY OKAY I'LL. THREE OF US I'M SORRY MR CANS OUT THERE ISN'T SHE YEAH. WELCOME BACK MISS BARRICADE HAND. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU I HAVE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE GONNA START WITH AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX AT THIS IS A BILL TO PROTECT ABORTION CARE LAWS ACROSS THE COUNTRY- MAKING ABORTION A CRIME WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PENALTIES FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS THE SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED NOT TO STAND WITH ROE V. WADE AND CHOSEN TO STAND ASIDE AND LET THE LAWS UNDERMINE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THAT WAS SO HARD FOUGHT. THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER BUT WILL HAPPEN THEY WILL HAPPEN THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE RISK IN RUIN THE LIVES OF THOSE SEEKING THEM OR PROTECT THEM WHETHER PORTION WILL BE SAFE OR DANGEROUS AND WHETHER WILL CHOICE WILL BE LEGAL OR FINANCIALLY RUINOUS WITH ABORTION LEFT UP TO THE STATES IT'S UP TO A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA TO STAND UP FOR THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX APPROACH TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM CIVIL LIABILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS TO RECEIVE PROVIDE OR AID IN ABORTION CARE AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX SIMPLY DECLARES ANY CIVIL ACTION FOR EATING IN OR RECEIVING ABORTION TO BE CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC POLICY OF CALIFORNIA AND THEREFORE UNENFORCEABLE IN OUR STATE COURTS. OPPOSITION ARGUES THAT THIS BILL LEGALIZES MALPRACTICE LET ME BE CLEAR THIS IS ENTIRELY UNTRUE. ANYTHING THAT IS CURRENTLY ILLEGAL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW WILL REMAIN SO. AS AN ATTORNEY I UNDERSTAND THE POWER THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE. THE PUBLIC PUBLIC SEE EXEMPTION WHICH YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT FROM OUR WITNESS OF THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE STATES THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ONE STATE TO APPLY AND OTHER STATES LAW THE VIOLATES ITS OWN LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY. CALIFORNIA HAS NO OBLIGATION TO ENFORCE CIVIL PENALTIES WOULD VIOLATE THE ABORTION RIGHTS PROTECTED IN OUR OWN CONSTITUTION. WHEN A PREGNANT PERSON'S CHOICE ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES QUESTIONED THE LIVES OF ALL PREGNANT PEOPLE ARE AT STAKE WE IS A STATE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING THIS IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE. AB SIXTY SIXTY SIX CREATES THE PROTECTIONS TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A SANCTUARY FOR THOSE MAKING REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES AND THOSE PROVIDING CARE. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OR SALINAS AND ALL AN OBGYN PROVIDER UC SAN DIEGO INDIA DOESN'T RUN A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. THEY WERE MOST BY MISS KOREA SECOND BY MISTER NAZARIAN SILENT MOTION BUT SITE SO. OF THESE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR WITNESSES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TESTIMONY TODAY MY NAME IS DR SALINAS ANIMAL A BOARD CERTIFIED OBGYN A COMPLEX FAMILY PLANNING SPECIALIST I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE OF ABORTION COUNSEL. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING DISTRICT NINE OF THE MERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS WHO IS CO SPONSORING ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX. ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX PROVIDES PROTECTIONS TO ABORTION PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS. BY PROHIBITING CIVIL ACTION FROM ANY OTHER STATE LAW FROM BEING APPLIED TO THOSE IN CALIFORNIA. AS A PHYSICIAN WHO PROVIDES FULL SPECTRUM ABORTION CARE I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE PROTECTIONS OF AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX ARE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE UNITED STATES IS ALLOWING FOR UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNTS OF LEGISLATION AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. IN CALIFORNIA MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE ALREADY SEEING PATIENTS TRAVELING FROM TEXAS UNDER SB EIGHT TO OBTAIN CARE. OKLAHOMA RECENTLY PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE. AN ESTIMATED THIRTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE WHO CAN GET PREGNANT WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ABORTION IF THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE VERSUS WADE. I PROVIDED ABORTION CARE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. AND I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE EFFECTS OF LIMITING ACCESS TO ABORTION. AGENTS ARE FORCED TO DELAY THEIR CARE THEY TROUBLE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF MILES IF YOU FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AND TIME AWAY FROM WORK JUST UNDERGO A SIMPLE AND SAFE MEDICAL PROCEDURE. UNFORTUNATELY THESE PATIENTS ARE THE LUCKY ONES THE ONES WITH THE PRIVILEGE IN THE MEANS TO ACTUALLY TRAVEL OUT OF STATE. THE MAJORITY PATIENTS DON'T HAVE THIS ABILITY TO LEAVE THEIR STATE AND ARE ULTIMATELY FORCED TO CONTINUE PREGNANCY IS THAT MAYBE THREATS TO THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR SAFETY. PERHAPS EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS A RECENT LEGISLATION OUT OF MISERY. WHICH SUPPORTS CIVIL SUITS AGAINST ANYONE PERFORMING AN ABORTION ON A MISSOURI RESIDENT OR ASSISTING A MISSOURI RESIDENT OBTAINING AN ABORTION. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THAT ABORTION TAKES PLACE. I TAKE MY PATIENTS AT THESE VALUE THEY COME TO ME WITH THE NEED FOR A SERVICE THAT I CAN EXPERTLY PROVIDE. I WILL NEVER INTERROGATED PATIENT ABOUT THEIR STATE OF ORIGIN AND I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES TREAT THEIR PATIENTS WITH THE SAME RESPECT. THIS IS NO LONGER THEORETICAL UNFORTUNATELY IN THESE LEGISLATION LIKE THIS PUT OUR CALIFORNIA PROVIDERS AT RISK. WE KNOW THAT ABORTION IS ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE. CALIFORNIA IS BECOMING A SAFE HAVEN AND A DESTINATION STATE FOR PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. I AM SO HONORED TO SERVE MY PATIENTS BUT I CAN ONLY CONTINUE TO DO THIS SAFELY WITH THE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS. PLEASE ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES AND I THE PEACE OF MIND TO FOCUS ON THE PATIENTS SITTING IN FRONT OF US EVERY DAY. AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY DESERVE. HELP US PROTECT ABORTION ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA. BY VOTING I OUT ON ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING. MY NAME IS DIEGO ZAMBRANO AND I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT STANFORD LAW SCHOOL. I WRITE AND TEACH IN THE FIELD OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. IN THE PAST YEAR I'VE BEEN STUDYING TEXAS S. B. ANTI ABORTION BILL. I'M HERE TODAY TO COMMENT ON POTENTIAL FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES TO AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX. I BELIEVE THE BILL COMPLIES WITH THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION AND WOULD LIKELY SURVIVE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE. SO I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL'S CONSTITUTIONALITY. AS THE BILL REPORT DISCUSSES THE MAIN POTENTIAL ISSUE. WITH THE BILL IS THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE OF ARTICLE FOUR SECTION ONE OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. UNDER THAT CLAUSE STATES ARE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE OTHER STATES STATUTES PUBLIC RECORDS AND COURT DECISIONS. THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE HOWEVER IS NOT IRON CLAD IN AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TWO WELL RECOGNIZED EXCEPTIONS. THE PUBLIC POLICY EXCEPTION FOR PROVISION BE ONE. IN THE PENAL JUDGMENTS EXCEPTION FOR PROVISION BE TO. FIRST A COURT WOULD MOST LIKELY OF HOLD AB SIXTY SIXTY SIX B. ONE THE PROVISION WHICH PROHIBITS CALIFORNIA COURTS FROM ENTERTAINING CLAIMS. UNDER ANTI ABORTION LAWS LIKE TEXAS SB EIGHT. THAT PROVISION IS PROBABLY CONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE PUBLIC POLICY EXCEPTION WHICH PROVIDES THAT SEATS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO APPLY ANOTHER STATE'S LAWS THAT VIOLATE THEIR OWN LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY. AND THE PROTECTION OF A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO TERMINATE PREGNANCY IS DEFINITIVELY WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S ONLY GERMAN PUBLIC POLICY. TO BE SURE WHETHER THE STATE'S PUBLIC POLICY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING IN OTHER STATES IS RELEVANT. BUT AB SIXTY SIX SIX DOES NOT AT ALL DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OUT OF STATE CAUSES OF ACTION IF FLAT OUT STATES A GENERAL OPPOSITION TO ANY SUCH LOSS IN STATE OR OUT OF STATE. FURTHERMORE THE BILL STRENGTHENED BY ITS AFFIRMATIVE DECLARATION OF CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY AGAINST SUITS TARGETING ABORTION PROVIDERS. SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT CALIFORNIA MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PENAL JUDGMENTS EXCEPTION TO THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE TO PREVENT ITS COURTS FROM ENFORCING SB EIGHT STYLE JUDGMENTS. IF F. B. IF SB EIGHT IS PENAL CALIFORNIA IS NOT BOUND TO ENFORCE SB EIGHT STYLE JUDGMENTS IN ITS COURTS IN AB SIXTY SIX SIX B. TWO WOULD PASS CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER. ACTIONS THAT- PENAL IN NATURE HAVE TO BE IN FORCE IN THE STATE WHERE THEY OCCURRED IN THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION THAT MAKES OUR OWN PENAL IS WHETHER A CLAIM REMEDIES A PRIVATE INJURY. CALIFORNIA HAS A GOOD ARGUMENT THAT SPD'S PENAL BECAUSE IT LACKS A PERSONAL INJURY REQUIREMENT IT PROVIDES FOR TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND STATUTORY DAMAGES AND IT IS ATTEMPTING TO PUNISH AN OFFENSE AGAINST THE COMMUNITY. SO IN SOME I BELIEVE THE LAW WOULD SURVIVE CHALLENGES ON THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION BECAUSE OF THOSE TWO EXCEPTIONS AND I AM THEREFORE IN SUPPORT OF THE LAW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY THAN ANYONE IN OPPOSITION HERE. HELLO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JENNIFER MILBORNE AND I'M THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COORDINATOR FOR ABORTION SURVIVORS NETWORK THE ONLY ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES THE SURVIVORS OF ABORTION AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD PROHIBIT THE APPLICATION OF LAWS THAT AUTHORIZES CIVIL ACTION AGAINST PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO SEEK PERFORM INDUCE AID OR ABET THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ABORTION CONTRARY TO THE INTERESTS OF THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE THAT ABORTION IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS CITIZENS BOTH BORN AND UNBORN. I SPEAK ABOUT THIS WITH SPECIFIC AUTHORITY BECAUSE I AM THE VICTIM OF A FAILED ABORTION. DATA REPEATEDLY SHOWS THAT ABORTION HARMS THE UNBORN CHILDREN BY TERMINATING THEIR LIFE STOPPING A VIABLE HEART BEAT. AND THE MOTHERS OF THOSE UNBORN CHILDREN WHO OFTEN SUFFERED VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE SCARS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. ABORTION IS NOT HEALTH CARE AND WHEN I HEAR STATEMENT THAT ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE I ARGUE THE ONLY REASON THAT I AM ALIVE TODAY IS BECAUSE OF THE FAILED HEALTH CARE MY BIOLOGICAL MOM RECEIVED. THE ABORTION DOCTOR FAILED TO COMPLETE THE ABORTION PROCEDURE. NOW DOESN'T THAT SOUND STRANGE A LIFE WAS SAVED BECAUSE A DOCTOR FAILED. USUALLY WHEN A DOCTOR FAIL SOMEONE DIES JUST THINK ABOUT THAT. I WAS MUCH FURTHER ALONG IN JUST A TIONAL AGE THAN WAS ANTICIPATED. AND DESPITE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE ABORTION INDUSTRY ABORTIONS REGULARLY ARE PERFORMED ON BABIES THAT ARE MUCH FARTHER ALONG THAN ESTIMATED. WHICH CAN CROSS THE LINE VIABILITY. I WAS NOT I DID SENIOR. THAT NEEDED TO BE TREATED I'M A HUMAN BEING. HOW CAN SOMETHING BE CONSIDERED HEALTH CARE WHEN THE DESIRED OUTCOME IS THAT A HEART BE IS STOPPED. NO I DON'T WISH TO CRIMINALIZE WOMEN THAT SEEK ABORTIONS. HOWEVER I WOULD ARGUE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS AN INTEREST IN PROVIDING BETTER OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN IN THEIR UNBORN CHILDREN. THIS BILL WILL HAVE THE CONSEQUENCE PERHAPS INTENDED OF MAKING CALIFORNIA A DESTINATION OF ABORTION AS STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY RECOGNIZE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND THE SACREDNESS OF LIFE AT ALL STAGES. THE ABORTION INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL COLLABORATE TO EXPLOIT VULNERABLE WOMEN AND EXTINGUISH THE LIVES OF PREBORN INFANTS. YOU MUST UP HOLD THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHICH STATES ALL PEOPLE ALL PEOPLE ARE BY NATURE FREE AND INDEPENDENT. AND HAVE AN ALIEN OPAL RIGHT. AMONG THESE ARE ENJOYING AND DEFENDING LIFE AND LIBERTY. HOW CAN A RIGHT TO AN ABORTION SUPERSEDE MY OWN RIGHT TO LIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU X. WITNESS PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIDGET BLAIR I AM THE FORMER CEO OF HOLLISTER PREGNANCY CENTER AND THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE SILENT NO MORE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN I HAVE HAD THREE FIRST TRIMESTER SUCTION D. AND C. ABORTIONS AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN I BECAME PREGNANT I WAS NAIVE AND IMMATURE A CHILD I WENT TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO HAVE AN ABORTION AND WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED I WEISS I WAS SIGNED UP FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL. AND HAD A FREE ABORTION WITHOUT MY PARENTS CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE SAW THE COLLECTION BOTTLE FILLED WITH THE BLOOD AND PARTS OF MY BABY I WAS TRAUMATIZED. AFTER THE ABORTION I SPIRALED INTO DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE I BECAME PREGNANT AGAIN AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN. THE PAIN AND SHAME I CARRIED COMPOUNDED WHEN I FOUND MYSELF BACK AT THE CLINIC A SECOND TIME. I BECAME DEPRESSED AND BEGAN STRUGGLING IN SCHOOL I CUT CLASSES AND HAD TO GO TO A LOCAL JUNIOR COLLEGE TO EARN EXTRA CREDITS TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. WHEN I FOUND MYSELF PREGNANT A THIRD TIME I WENT TO THE CLINIC AN EMOTIONAL WRECK. I WAS EMOTIONALLY FRAGILE AND UNSTABLE. I FELT HOPELESS I DID NOT RECEIVE AN ASSESSMENT REGARDING MY EMOTIONAL HEALTH NOR WAS I OFFERED ANY TYPE OF PREGNANCY OUTCOME OPTIONS. ON THE MEDICAL TABLE I WAS CRYING I WAS VULNERABLE ON MY BACK MY FEET WERE IN THE STIRRUPS AND THE NURSE LOOKED DOWN AT ME AND SAID. YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS DO YOU. I SAID NOW. THE NURSE SAID IT WILL BE OVER SOON. I WAS INVISIBLE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS YET THE CLINIC PERFORMED THE ABORTION EVEN THOUGH I SAID NO BEFORE THE PROCEDURE BEGAN. THEY DENIED MY RIGHT TO CHOOSE. THEY DIDN'T THEY DENIED MY RIGHT TO CHANGE MY MIND. AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX WON'T PROTECT WOMEN. THE ONLY PEOPLE AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX WILL PROTECT OUR ABORTIONISTS RAPISTS AND HUMAN TRAFFICKERS WHO VIOLATE VIOLATED OTHER STATE LAWS PROTECTING WOMEN. AB SIXTEEN SIX WHAT WILL REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE VALID JUDGMENTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR ABORTION MALPRACTICE COMMITTED IN OTHER STATES AGAINST SUCH VICTIMIZERS. IGNORING THOSE JUDGMENTS WILL VICTIMIZE WOMEN A SECOND TIME. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO VOTE NOW ON AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX THANK YOU.

FIRST DAY JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS INCREDIBLY. BOLD AND COURAGEOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AS WE ARE SEEN AT WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND- A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO. NEED THIS TYPE OF SUPPORT I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME. I DO WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST SAY THANK YOU TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE OPPOSITION AS WELL. IT IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING AND HARD AND DIFFICULT TO SHARE THE STORIES. AND THEY ARE NO WAY TO BE DISMISSED. I THANK YOU TO THE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AS WELL BECAUSE YOU ARE ALSO SHARING THE VOICES OF. INDIVIDUALS PEOPLE AND WOMEN WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY. OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE TEXAS LEGISLATURE IS MOSTLY WHITE IT IS MOSTLY MALE AND IT IS NOT A REFLECTION. OF THE ENTIRE STATE OF TEXAS. AND AS- REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE CONTINUES TO BE ATTACKED. ACROSS THE NATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA. DOES WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. AND THAT ULTIMATELY. THE DECISIONS THESE INCREDIBLY HARD CHOICES AND DECISIONS. THE PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE CONVERSATION. AND I JUST INCREDIBLY THAT ASPECT. AND AS CALIFORNIA GOES SO DOES THE NATION ARE SO I HOPE. ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGER NATIONAL CONVERSATION OF. ROE V. WADE CALIFORNIA AND THE FACT THAT. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR. MORE WOMEN ELECTED INTO OFFICE AND REPRESENTATION MATTERS. AND SO WELL. WHITE MALE LEGISLATORS AND WHITE LEADERS WHITE MALE LEADERS IN TEXAS AND- WHITE MALE GOVERNOR IN TEXAS WILL MAKE DECISIONS ON. WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA IT IS WOMEN. IN IT IS PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT ARE MAKING DECISIONS. FOR WHAT IS TRULY A REPRESENTATIVE STATE ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND FOR THAT. I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND I WILL BE ONE HUNDRED SUPPORT.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU M. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER CREO FOR HER COMMENTS I KNOW SHE HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE CHAMPION. FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN FORCIBLY STERILIZED HERE IN OUR STATE AND DONE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT. AND I THINK THAT THAT EMPHASIZES THE POINT YOU MADE WHICH IS CHOICE MEANS CHOICE RIGHT IN THOSE WOMEN THAT YOU'VE ADVOCATED FOR SO INCREDIBLY IN THIS LEGISLATURE WERE FORCED. NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN RIGHT AND SO WHAT WE STAND FOR AS A STATE AND AS A BODY. IS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND SO I THINK IT'S THANK YOU FOR KNOWLEDGE IN THE TESTIMONY OF THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE REMEMBER. WHAT IT IS WE STAND FOR AND THAT IS THE RIGHT FOR EVERY SINGLE. WOMAN IN THIS STATE. TO DECIDE FOR HERSELF WHAT HER FUTURE HOLDS. AND THAT MEANS THE RIGHT TO SEEK HEALTH CARE FROM INCREDIBLE DOCTOR DR SANTA PAULA I WANT TO THANK FOR PROVIDING THIS HEALTHCARE. EVERY DAY TO THOSE WHO NEED IT. AND THAT WE AS A STATE WILL NOT STAND. FOR FOREIGN STATES TO TELL US WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR PROVIDERS. AND OUR CITIZENS WITHIN OUR STATE BOUNDARIES BECAUSE HERE. YOU MAY COM AND WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT ABOUT. THANK YOU AGAIN MR QUE HANNAH IS A WHITE MALE CALIFORNIAN I SUPPORT YOU 100% MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WOOD I WOULD I WALDRON WALDRON NO AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY AYE ARAMBULA ARAMBULA AYE BIGELOW. RIO RIO AYE FLORA. MAIENSCHEIN MAYES MCCARTY. THIS AREA NAZARIAN I'D RIVAS RIVAS AYE RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I SANTIAGO. ALL RIGHT KALRA I. YOU HAVE A BOAT SAYS THE FIRST BILL OUT TODAY AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE THANK. THANK YOU MR YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL. I DO NOT GOING ANYWHERE SORRY MR SALAS I. I AM NOW WE WILL TAKE A BABY TWENTY EIGHTY NINE. I THINK YOU AT MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PRESENT THIS BILL. WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS WHAT SURGERIES OR HOSPITALIZATIONS HAVE YOU HAD. HOW OFTEN LAST YEAR HAVE YOU HAD FIVE OR MORE ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AND ANYONE OCCASION. WHICH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH. ON A SCALE OF ONE TO THREE HOW OFTEN DO YOU FEEL AS IF SOMETHING TERRIBLE MIGHT HAPPEN. IF YOU ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE ANY INFORMATION INFORMATION COLLECTED WOULD BE PROTECTED BY HIPPA. BUT IF YOU ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS TO CONNECT CONNECT TO A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER THROUGH AN APP YOUR INFORMATION WILL ONLY BE PROTECTED BY THE C. PRS. THIS SERVICE COULD AND DOES LEGALLY SELL THIS INFORMATION OR USE IT FR ADVERTISING. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PANDEMIC THE ONLINE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SPACES EXPLODED WITH AS MANY AS TWENTY THOUSAND APPS IN THIS CATEGORY GLOBALLY. FIRST THESE COMPANIES WILL TARGET THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS INDIVIDUALS BASED OFF OF PROBABLE DIAGNOSIS. THEN THEY WILL REQUIRE A DETAILED SURVEY WITH QUESTIONS TARGETING HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION LIKE THE ONES I'VE GIVEN YOU. WE'VE SEEN THESE DATA SHARED WITH THESE APPS SHOP ACROSS THE INTERNET AND EVEN SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES IN THE CASE OF A SUICIDE SUPPORT TEXTING LINE.  STUDY OF THE THIRTY SIX TOP RANKED APPS FOR DEPRESSION AND SMOKING FOUND THAT TWENTY NINE TRANSMITTED DATA TO SERVICES PROVIDED BY FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE. IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT IF PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH CARE THEY KNOW HOW THEIR DATA IS SHARED AND HOW IT IS PROTECTED IF AT ALL. THIS BILL LIMITS COMPANIES FROM SHARING OR SELLING DATA UNLESS IT IS DE IDENTIFIED DATA STANDARDS. THE INFORMATION IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO BE SHARED AND THE CONSUMER AFFIRMATIVELY CONSENTS TO THE SHARING OF THIS INFORMATION WHICH IS CRITICAL. YOU HAVE TO SAY IT IS OKAY TO SHARE YOUR- MENTAL HEALTH DATA. THE SECOND PORTION OF THE BILL REQUIRES THE DEVELOPERS TO REGISTER WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHICH WILL ADDRESS THE NEED FOR IDENTIFICATION OF THE GOOD ACTORS IN THE MURKY SPACE. ESPECIALLY FOR PROVIDERS LIKE YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY. MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS UNIQUELY VULNERABLE AND IT IS BECOMING-DIGITAL AND WE MUST PROTECT IT AS SUCH. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS MAUREEN MAHONEY SENIOR POLICY ANALYST FOR CONSUMER REPORTS AND I WILL BE READING A STATEMENT FROM DR PALMER SEAL A PSYCHOLOGIST WITH OVER THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE AND THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ADVOCACY COORDINATOR FOR THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. PLEASE GO AHEAD CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AT CONSUMER REPORTS WE APPLAUD THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR INTRODUCING AB TWENTY EIGHTY NINE BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE CONSUMERS HE PROTECTIONS OVER THE PRIVACY OF INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MENTAL HEALTH APPS CONSISTENT WITH PROTECTIONS OVER THE PRIVACY OF SUCH DATA COLLECTED IN A MEDICAL SETTING. MORE PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED BECAUSE THE COMPANY TÍNH PANDEMIC HAS LED TO HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION AND MENTAL ILLNESS BUT THE SAME TIME IT'S MADE IT HARDER TO OBTAIN CARE. MANY CONSUMERS HAVE TURNED TO MENTAL HEALTH APPS TO FILL THE GAP BUT BECAUSE THESE APPS ARE INCONSISTENTLY COVERED BY STRONG HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS LIKE HIPAA. IN CMA CONSUMERS ARE VULNERABLE TO THE INAPPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE OF THEIR INFORMATION SUCH AS WELL WHETHER THEY SUFFER FROM ANXIETY POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS OR EATING DISORDERS. CONSUMERS AND THERAPIST LIKE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THE DATA WILL BE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED WHEN USING A MENTAL HEALTH UP. SOME APPS COLLECT CONNECT CONSUMERS WITH LICENSED THERAPIST OVER VIDEO WHICH WOULD TYPICALLY BE COVERED BY HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS BUT- THE SAME APPS ARE SIMILAR SOUNDING ONES MAY PROVIDE ME TRACKING DIARIES THERAPY CHAT BOTS. OR ASK YOU TO COMPLETE A QUESTIONNAIRE ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM SYMPTOMS WHICH TYPICALLY WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS. THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE CONSUMER REPORTS TESTING HAS FOUND THAT MENTAL HEALTH APPS SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT USERS WITH TECH COMPANY THE TRACK THEIR BEHAVIOR ACROSS OTHER APPS. THAT INFORMATION COULD BE USED TO TARGET ADS TO YOU BASED ON INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THEIR DATA MIGHT BE SHARED- MISCUES. WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT THE STATE IS COVERED BY- THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT THIS WAS NOT ADEQUATE TO PROTECT SUCH SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA. IT GIVES CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR INFORMATION BUT THIS BILL IS MUCH STRONGER BECAUSE IT WOULD PROHIBIT MOST CASES OF DATA SHARING. AT ALL AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY CONSUMERS AREN'T AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE CCPA AND WON'T ACTIVELY REACH OUT TO STOP THE SELL THEIR INFORMATION. AND ALSO WE FOUND THAT EVEN WHEN CONSUMERS DO NOW AND TRY TO OPT OUT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO SO. FINALLY PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR AMENDED THE CCPA TO EXPLICITLY SET A FLOOR NOT A CEILING ON THE MEASURE IT'S INTENDED TO BE STRENGTHENED. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE BETTER PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF DATA THAT DESERVES GREATER PROTECTIONS. FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO SECURE KEY MENTAL HEALTH PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. FOR CONSUMERS. AND WITH THE CHAIRS PERMISSION I WILL READ THE TESTIMONY OF DOCTOR PAUL MARCEL. LICENSE I CALL JUST WAS UNABLE TO BE HERE IN PERSON TODAY. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD TO AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS DR PAUL MARCEL. I AM A LICENSE A CALIFORNIA LICENSE ECOLOGISTS AND I AM PLEASED TO PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK ON AB TWENTY EIGHTY NINE. I LIVE IN HAVE A PRIVATE PRACTICE IN SARATOGA NEAR SAN JOSE I WORK WITH BOTH ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS AND AS ARE MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE MOMENT I AM COMPLETELY INUNDATED WITH REQUESTS FROM INDIVIDUALS. SEEKING HELP FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS I'VE PROVIDED CARE TO OVER A HUNDRED PATIENTS DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC FROM THE AGES OF EIGHT TO SEVENTY FIVE. I'VE BEEN MEETING WITH MY PATIENTS VIRTUALLY TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF MY PATIENTS AND MYSELF. WITHOUT THE OPTION OF MEETING BY VIDEO OR PHONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSIST THESE INDIVIDUALS. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE A SUCH HOMES WE'VE NEVER EXPECTED AS MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DIGITAL PRIVACY. AS PROVIDERS WE TAKE RULES REGARDING PATIENT PRIVACY CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND HIPAA COMPLIANCE VERY SERIOUSLY. CERTAIN ONLINE SERVICES OFFER COUNSELING CONNECTIONS OF SLOW START TIME IS PROVIDERS WITHOUT MAKING IT CLEAR THAT WHEN WE CONNECT THROUGH THEM IT'S NOT THE SAE AS WHEN PATIENTS VISIT OUR OFFICES WHEN A PATIENT COMES INTO THE OFFICE I KNOW THAT EVERY PECE OF PAPER THEY TOUCH IN EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION THEY GIVE ME. AS A LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER WILL BE PROTECTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF HIPAA AND ANYTHING A PATIENT SHARES A CONFIDENTIAL I WOULD NEVER BE SURE WITHOUT THE WRITTEN PERMISSION. HOWEVER WHEN WE GO THROUGH SOME OF THE SAME COMMERCIAL PLATFORMS THE ADVERTISER SERVICES OR RIGHT OR WE RECOMMEND AN OP THE COULD BE USEFUL TO OUR PATIENTS THE DATA THAT OUR PATIENTS ARE AT THE TOP AND NOT DIRECTLY TO US IS NOT PROTECTED BY HIPAA. EVEN THOUGH THE DATA THEY PROVIDE CAN HELP THEM RECEIVE CARE FROM HAVE A COVERED ENTITIES LIKE OURSELVES A RECEIVE CARE IN LINE WITH THE CARE FROM THESE ENTITIES IT REGARDING THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITIONS ARE PRIVATE PERSONAL DETAILS REMAIN EXPOSED. MAY BE SOLD BY THE APAP FORM. WHEN I RECOMMENDED OCCUPATION I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE THEM TO VERIFY WHAT PERSONAL DATA IF ANY. WE SHARED OR SOLD BY THE POP FORM. BUT THIS INFORMATION IS OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR PATIENTS TO OBTAIN OR FIND IT IS NOT OUR JOB IS PROVIDERS TO ENSURE EVERY STEP OF CONSUMER. GOES THROUGH TO REACH US OR OBTAIN HELP PROTECTS INFORMATION BUT IS OUR CONCERN. REACHES OF THE PRIVACY COULD EVEN BE USED TO FURTHER EXACERBATE. A PATIENT'S MENTAL HEALTH. COMPANIES PROMISE ACCESS TO CARE OUR PROFESSIONAL CREDIBILITY IS ON THE LINE. WE WORK WITH INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CLIENTS INFORMATION THAT WHEN EXPLOITED COULD LEAD TO PREDATORY ADVERTISING OR EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION. WE DESERVE TO KNOW THAT WHEN WE USED TO TELL POP FORMS OR RECOMMEND THEM TO OUR PATIENTS THEIR EXACTLY AS SECURE AS OR IN PERSON DISCUSSION. I BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY THAT STRONG GUARDRAILS ON DATA COLLECTION FOR THIS POPCORN TO ADOPTED AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU VOTE I ON AB TWENTY. NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU M. ARE THERE IS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ANY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THEY KNOW WILL GO TO SUPPORTER OPPOSITION THE BILL FROM MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WHEN DISASTER NAME. ADDITION AN ORGANIZATION IS AVERY WHO LED THE SENATE CHANGE AND I'M FROM CAMPO THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND ORGANIZATIONS AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

BE YOU KNOW EVERVERSE. THEY MAY NOT COME BACK FOR CARE OR YOU KNOW SO I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

MAIENSCHEIN MAYES MCCARTY MCCARTY I IN THIS AREA. NAZARIAN I RIVAS RIVAS I RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I SANTIAGO KALRA ALL RIGHT. IN THE ZERO ZERO YOUR BILL THAT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHERS THAT ON THINK I'M ON A ROLL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THIS RIVAS SORRY MR SALAS MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS I'M CURRENTLY WORKING WITH CANNABIS STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND PLAN TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE BILL AT A LATER DATE AND THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE FOR HELPING ME. WORK THROUGH THIS BILL. WITH THE AMENDMENTS OF AB SIXTEEN NINETY OF THIS BILL WILL TRANSITION THE SALE OF ALL IN ONE DISPOSABLE VAPES WHICH ARE NOT RECHARGEABLE TO REUSABLE OR RECHARGEABLE SMOKING PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS. IMPACTS THAT THESE SINGLE USE PRODUCTS HAVE ON OUR HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT. ACCORDING TO THE CDC THE UNITED STATES IS EXPERIENCING AN EPIDEMIC OF LUNG INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH USE. ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. USE OF VAPES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OVER STUDENTS REPORTED USING VAPES IN SCHOOLS INCLUDING CLASSROOMS AND BATHROOMS. THE USE OF DISPOSABLE E. CIGARETTES INCREASED ABOUT A CIGARETTE USERS AND TWENTY TWENTY. TEAMS MAY NOT REALIZE THAT NICOTINE IS DEEPLY ADDICTIVE THE NICOTINE FROM THESE VAPE PRODUCTS CAN SPELL TROUBLE AT ANY LIFE STAGE BUT IT'S DANGEROUS BEFORE THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED. NICOTINE ACTUALLY CHANGES ADOLESCENT'S BRAIN CELL ACTIVITY IN THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTENTION LEARNING AND MEMORY. IT CAN ALSO WORSEN ANXIETY. STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT IT CONTAINS THE LETTER AND VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS SOME OF WHICH ARE LINKED TO CANCER. AS VAPE USAGE SURGES IN THE UNITED STATES THEY OFTEN OVERLOOKED FOR THE FIRE DANGER THAT THEY POSE FOR WASTE AND RECYCLING WORKERS. ACCORDING TO THE FDA VAPES CAN CATCH ON FIRE OR EXPLODED SERIOUSLY HURT PEOPLE. A VAPE PENS MAIN SAFETY ISSUE LIES IN THE LITHIUM ION BATTERY IT CONTAINS TO FUEL THE HEATING ELEMENT OR A ADAM ATOMIZER. RUSSIA HAS HOW TO SAY THAT- LITHIUM ION BATTERIES ARE QUITE POWERFUL AND SPARK THERMAL EVENTS ARE FIRES WHEN THEY'RE DAMAGED. THE SHAPING CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES CAN MAKE THEM BEHAVE LIKE FLAMING ROCKETS WHEN A BATTERY FAILS. BETWEEN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINE AND DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE SEPARATE INCIDENTS OF EXPLOSION AND FIRE INVOLVING AN ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES WERE REPORTED BY THE U. S. MEDIA. 62% OF THE INCIDENCE OF EXPLOSION. INVOLVING AN ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE OR ITS BATTERY OCCURRED WHEN THE DEVICE WAS EITHER IN A POCKET- ACTIVELY IN USE ADDITIONALLY VAPES CAN ALSO CONTAIN HEAVY METALS BATTERY ACID NICOTINE AND OTHER HARMFUL CHEMICALS. IMPROPERLY DISPOSING OF THESE ALL IN ONE DISPOSABLE BABES ARE KNOWN TO LEACH TOXIC CHEMICALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT POLLUTE WATER AND HARM WILDLIFE THE MICROPLASTICS AND HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS THAT LEACH FROM THIS VAPE WASTE ACCUMULATES IN THE FOOD CHAIN AND AFFECTS WHOLE ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDING THE HEALTH OF SOILS. CURRENT LAW PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND A. B. NINE THIRTY NINE SAID OUR WASTE HIERARCHY AT SOURCE REDUCTION FIRST THEN RECYCLING. REUSABLE REUSABLE VAPES ARE ALREADY WIDELY AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET AND OUR LAST WASTEFUL ALTERNATIVE AND ALIGN WITH CALIFORNIA'S WASTE HIERARCHY. BY MOVING AWAY FROM ALL IN ONE DISPOSABLE VAPES VAPES THE SMOKING INDUSTRY WILL BE DRIVEN TO TRANSITION THEIR PRODUCTS TO BE LAST WASTEFUL. TODAY I HAVE HEIDI SANBORN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL SERVING AS OUR WITNESS THANK YOU. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBER RIVAS CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HEIDI SANBORN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL A NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES FOR CIRCULAR AND EQUITABLE ECONOMY AND WE ARE THE SPONSOR OF AB SIXTEEN NINETY. AS DISCUSSED BOTH COMMITTEES SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AND THE PROPOSED SIXTEEN NINETY YOU'LL BE VOTING ON TODAY IS DIFFERENT THAN THE BILL AND PRINT. THEREFORE ONLY FOCUS ON THE AMENDED VERSION AND SINGLE USE VAPING PRODUCTS IN MY TESTIMONY. NON RECHARGEABLE VAPING DEVICES INCLUDE A BATTERY THAT CANNOT BE REMOVED TO RECHARGE. BATTERIES ARE CONSIDERED UNIVERSAL WASTE IN CALIFORNIA AND ARE PROHIBITED FROM DISPOSAL. HOWEVER MANY NON RECHARGEABLE ELECTRONIC VAPING DEVICES WE FIND ONLINE. ARE ADVERTISED AND LABELED AS DISPOSABLE WHICH IMPLIES THAT THEY CAN BE DISPOSED OF IN THE TRASH. THE FOR MANY CONSUMERS DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE HAZARDOUS AND YOU THROW THEM IN THE TRASH IN THE RECYCLING ILLEGALLY. THE FREQUENT TOSLINK CRUSHING AND SHREDDING IN THE WASTE AND RECYCLING STREAMS CAN CAUSE BATTERIES TO BE DAMAGE AND IGNITE CATCHING FIRE TO ADJACENT MATERIALS. AND VAPING VIA DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS ON A QUOTE IS ON THE RISE FOR BOTH TOBACCO AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS. AMONG USE CIGARETTES ESPECIALLY DISPOSABLES ARE MORE POPULAR THAN TRADITIONAL TOBACCO PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE NATIONAL YOUTH TOBACCO SURVEY MORE THAN TWO MILLION U. S. MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED USING E. CIGARETTES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NON RECHARGEABLE VAPES ARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND THEREFORE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN AND TEENS. THE USE OF DISPOSABLE E. CIGARETTES INCREASED MORE THAN MIDDLE SCHOOLERS THAT USE E. CIGARETTES IN TWENTY TWENTY. REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF NON RECHARGEABLE VAPING PRODUCTS. NUMBER RIVAS MENTIONED SOME POINTS AD I'LL ADD A FEW MORE ONE ELECTRONIC VAPING PRODUCTS ARE PROPERLY DISPOSED IN THE ENVIRONMENT TOXINS AND PLASTICS LEACH INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT AND IMPACT PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM EXPOSURE. JUST THIS WEEK LAST WEEK IT WAS REPORTED THAT RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND MICROPLASTICS IN HUMAN BLOOD FOR THE FIRST TIME. WITH SCIENTISTS FINDING TINY PARTICLES AND ALMOST 80% OF THE PEOPLE TESTED. ADDITIONALLY THE STATE WIDE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL ADOPTED ON FEBRUARY TWENTY THIRD THE FIRST IN THE NATION STATEWIDE MICROPLASTICS STRATEGY WHICH INCLUDED THE RECOMMENDATION TO PROHIBIT THE SALE OF SINGLE USE TOBACCO PRODUCTS THE DEMONSTRABLY CONTRIBUTE TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS PLASTIC POLLUTION. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. ADDITIONALLY THIS CALIFORNIA SIXTEEN MEMBER STATEWIDE RECYCLING COMMISSION WHICH I CHAIR VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO APPROVE A POLICY RECOMMENDATION THAT QUOTE SOME PRODUCTS OR JUST TOXIC AND UNNECESSARY AND HAVE SAFER AND CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES. MAKING THEIR SALE UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY. INCLUDING SINGLE USE VAPING PRODUCTS THE COMMISSION INCLUDES REPRESENT OF SOME GOVERNMENTS WASTE HAULERS NONPROFITS AND UNIONS. THREE THANK THE HEALTH COMMITTEE STAFFER THERE- HELP AND HOPE THAT THIS AMENDED VERSION WILL PASS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS RIVAS COUNTY VETERAN NORRIS AND MARK STONE FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL.

WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE A CIGARETTE **** ARE. QUITE LIKELY THE MOST LITTERED LITTERED ITEM ON THE PLANET. SMOKING IS MY ENEMY I'VE BEEN A PASSION ANTI SMOKING ADVOCATE MY ENTIRE LIFE. THE MY VERSION TO SMOKING- MADE THIS BILL PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING. REPEATEDLY SHOW MYSELF AS A PROTECTOR OF THE ENVIRONMENT SO ONE WOULD THINK I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL- POWER MY CONCERN THE CONCERN THAT MANY MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE BROUGHT TO ME IS THAT BANNING. THE PRODUCT WOULD SIMPLY NOT SOLVE THE LITTER PROBLEM THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FILTERS AND THE CIGARETTES SO. CIGARETTES WILL CONTINUE TO BE SMUGGLED INTO THE STATE OR PURCHASED OUTSIDE THE STATE. SOVEREIGN TRIBES COULD STILL SELL CIGARETTES THAT WITH FILTERS ON THEIR LAND. THAT MEANS BANNING THE PRODUCT WOULD NOT STOP LITTERING OR SMOKING IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE NEED A DIFFERENT SOLUTION TO LITTERING LITTER PROBLEM. AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE AUTHOR CAN DO THAT- AS WE OFFER THESE AMENDMENTS WHICH YOU HAVE ACCEPTED BUT I THANK YOU FOR THAT. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL- THE BILL. AS AMENDED AS AS YOU'VE ACCEPTED- DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION IT WOULD BE DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE- IS THERE A MOTION. MOTION BY MISTAKE OR CARRY A SECOND BY MISS CARILLO.

AS HEALTH COMMITTEE MEMBERS I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF BILLS WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST YEARS WITH SUGGESTED CHANGES TO THE LANDER MEANT THAT FOR SHORT ACT. WHILE WE INTENDED THE WELL WELL WELL INTENDED THESE PROPOSALS TENDED TO ADDRESS SINGLE ASPECTS OF LPS RATHER THAN AT THE BROADER MORE SYSTEMIC SYSTEMIC ISSUES OF A FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD PROGRAM THAT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. HAS NEVER HAD A FULL EVALUATION OR REPORT. THAT'S WHY LAST DECEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND I AGREED TO CONDUCT A JOINT HEARING ON THE L. P. S. ACT. AFTER NEARLY NINE HOURS OF TESTIMONY AND DISCUSSION. IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS ADDRESSING. MOST ALARMING WAS THE LACK OF CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN SOME BASIC ACTS ASPECTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT. INCONSISTENCIES THAT RESULT IN PEOPLE BEING DETAINED ON FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS. TREATED DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY RESIDE OR HOW THINGS ARE INTERPRETED. THE SECOND MOST ALARMING REVELATION WAS THE ALMOST COMPLETE LACK OF DATA. EITHER REAL TIME OR HISTORICAL. HOW CAN A SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND SERVE OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DATA. ON WHICH TO ASSESS ITS EFFECTIVENESS. HOW CAN WE AS A LEGISLATURE BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE RIGHT THING ON BEHALF OUR CITIZENS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE IS A RELATIVELY SIMPLE BILL AND DEFEND DEFINITELY A WORK IN PROGRESS. FROM THE DATA PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE LAID OUT A REPORTING FRAMEWORK AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TO SPECIFY EXACTLY WHAT DATA SHOULD SHOULD BE REQUIRED FROM THE COUNTIES. THE FACILITIES THE L. E. O.'S AND OTHERS. THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. MR STONE JOINT AUTHOR IS HERE TO ADDRESS THE PERSON THE MORE PROCEDURAL CHANGES THIS BILL WILL ACCOMPLISH THROUGH CLARIFICATION OF EXISTING LPS ACT LPS REQUIREMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STUFF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS AN ELEMENTAL BILL. AND IT'S ONE THAT COMES AFTER VERY LONG HEARING AND A LOT OF DEBATE OVER ISN'T WORKING AND ONE OF THE- AS THE CHAIR POINTS OUT. DATA COLLECTION AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE DO AND DO NOT KNOW IS A REAL GAP HERE. THE DUE PROCESS CONSIDERATIONS WHICH ARE THAT PART OF THIS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO MY COMMITTEE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT DUE TO INCONSISTENCIES IN INTERPRETATION OF LPS ACROSS THE STATE. AREAS INDIVIDUALS DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE WHICH COUNTY THERE IN AND WHERE THOSE. INTERPRETATIONS ARE HAPPENING CAN BE BEING HELD. ON BEYOND WHAT THE STATUTE ACTUALLY ALLOWS. AND IN SOME INSTANCES THERE TREATED A LOT MORE FAIRLY SO WE HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT INCONSISTENCIES AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THAT THIS BILL IS WORKING TO TRY AND CLEAN UP. IS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION IF WE'RE GOING TO BE USING. THAT WITH THE CARE COURT PROPOSAL WITH A LOT OF OTHER PROPOSALS AROUND CONSERVATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN COMING OUT LPS SYSTEM IS ULTIMATELY THE FOUNDATIONS THE BACKSTOPS. TO ALL OF THIS SOME OF THE PROPOSALS IT'S UNCLEAR. MIKE TRIED TO AMEND THE LPS SYSTEM WHICH IS A BIT FRUSTRATING SINCE WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA TO KNOW REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO AMEND YET. WAR THEY'RE GOING TO RELY ON THE LPS SYSTEM BEING THAT. BACKSTOPS TO THE FRIEND AND SERVICES THAT THEY WANT TO PROVIDE. SO IF WE HAVEN'T CLARIFIED AND DON'T HAVE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THE LPS SYSTEM. WE'RE POTENTIALLY HEADED FOR SOME REFORMS THAT WILL. BE A BIT OF ACCORDION NOT UNFORTUNATELY. SO HI THIS IS. IMPORTANT WORK ITS REALLY FOUNDATIONAL WORK IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE DOING THIS TOGETHER. AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR STONE- WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES TO SPEAK TO A TO THE BILL TODAY MICHELLE CABRERA. WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND DEBORAH OFF WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRS MICHELLE CABINET I WITH THE- COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. CBH DA MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY NET. PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH SIGNIFICANT NEEDS INCLUDING OVERSIGHT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF THE LPS ACT. CBH DA HAS A SUPPORTING CONCEPT ON AB TWO TWO SEVEN FIVE AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE LPS ACT. STARTING WITH THE FOUNDATIONAL INFORMATIONAL AND OVERSIGHT HEARING IN THE FALL AND CULMINATING WITH THIS BILL. FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT OUR MEMBERS TAKE THEIR OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER LPS LAW VERY SERIOUSLY. OUR MEMBERS UNDERSTAND BOTH THE AWESOME RESPONSIBILITIES AFFORDED TO THEM IN DETERMINING WHEN AND HOW AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS CAN BE REMOVED. AS WELL AS THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN LIFE WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL MAY BE A RISK TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS DUE TO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. WELL COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING WHO MAY PLACE AND REMOVE HOLDS AND COORDINATION WITH OUR PUBLIC GUARDIANS TO ARRANGE FOR TREATMENT SERVICES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WE SHARE OVERLAPPING ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH VARIOUS OTHER SYSTEMS AND ENTITIES INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT. HOSPITALS COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. EXISTING REPORTING STRUCTURES FALL SHORT BECAUSE THEY FEEL TO RECOGNIZE THIS COMPLEXITY. NOT ALL LPS ACTIVITIES HAPPEN IN THE CONTEXT OF DESIGNATED FACILITIES AND COUNTY BEER HALL DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNDER CURRENT LAW TO COMPEL OUR PARTNERS. WHETHER LAW ENFORCEMENT HOSPITAL OR HEALTH PLANS. TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO US SO THAT WE CAN IN TURN PROVIDE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF INVOLUNTARY HOLDS AND TREATMENT TO THE STATE. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT AB TWO TWO SEVEN FIVE PRESENTS FOR S. TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PRODUCT PROGRESS IN ANSWERING A SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT SET OF QUESTIONS. WHO IS PLACED ON HOLD. FOR HOW LONG AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. WE BELIEVE THAT BASIC MACRO LEVEL DATA CAN HELP THE STATE TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER AND WHEN INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT IS USED AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT MAY BE. TO THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE AS WELL AS OUR SYSTEMIC PARTNERS WELL I MEMBERS HAVE CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IN THE BILL WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GOALS ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF THE AUTHORS AND BALANCING TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY. AND TRYING TO STANDARDIZE PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE SO WE'RE VERY EAGER TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS AND ACHIEVE THOSE AIMS THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MADAM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ART DEBRA DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WHAT ARE CHAIR WOULD ENSURE STONE ARE ARE DOING WITH THIS BILL- I THOUGHT THE HEARING WENT OVER NINE HOURS IT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE LONGEST LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS I HAVE EVER WITNESSED. AND IT WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT REVIEW OF THE LAND TERMAN PETROUS SHORT ACT. AND AT THIS POINT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THIS BILL THAT THE PART THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIS. NOT SO MUCH THE DATA. BUT TO CLARIFY WHAT IT MEANS TO PUT SOMEONE ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. IT REALLY TREATS PEOPLE UNFAIRLY AND TAKES AWAY RIGHTS ACROSS COUNTY LINES DEPENDING ON WHICH FACILITY YOU'VE BEEN TAKEN TO AND HOW THINGS UNFOLD AFTER THAT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT CLARIFIES THAT THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR CLOCK. STARTS TO RUN. THE MOMENT YOU ARE DETAINED SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY SIMPLE CONCEPT BUT WHAT WE FIND IS IN REALITY IS THAT IF A PERSON IS TAKEN TO A FACILITY THAT IS NOT THE COUNTY DESIGNATED FACILITY. THEY MAY LANGUAGE THERE UNTIL A TRANSFER IS NAY IS ABLE TO BE AFFECTED AND SOMETIMES THAT COMES CLOSE TO OR EVEN PASSED THE SAID THE INITIAL SEVENTY TWO HOURS. WE'VE ALSO NOTICED THAT DIFFERENT COUNTIES TREAT THINGS ARE TREAT THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONS DIFFERENTLY SO MAYBE YOU'RE LUCKY IF YOU GET YOUR FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND ONE COUNTY RATHER THAN ANOTHER AND IT JUSTSIMPLY SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY PEOPLE HAVE RIGHTS. AND THOSE RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND THE LETTERMAN PATRICK SHORT ACT SO WE SEE THIS AS AS A CLARIFYING CHANGE. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT- BECAUSE THIS BILL CONTAINS HAPPENS IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND BEYOND TO FACILITIES CONTROL. TO TRANSFER TO A COUNTY DESIGNATED FACILITY CERTAIN DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WILL ATTACH AT THAT POINT WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT VERY REASONABLE APPROACH AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE- ANY FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE WHO- JUST TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. NAME ORGANIZATION POSITION ONLY. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR TIBETAN REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF AMERICAN CALLED MERCY PHYSICIANS WE HAVE A SUPPORT OF A MINUTE POSITION WE APPRECIATE THE TIME WITH BOTH AUTHORS CONSULTANTS IN THE FORTY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.

AND I WANT TO THANK YOU I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR THE COLLABORATION ON THIS SIDE I'M NOT AWARE THAT THERE'S BEEN COLLABORATION WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NOW HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME- SO I I'M THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE THE OPTION TO WORK TOGETHER- AND THIS IS THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE. OF HOW OUR INTERIM HEARINGS LEAD TO LEGISLATION AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET FOUNDATIONAL DATA FOUNDATIONAL INFORMATION BE ABLE TO RIGHT SOME WRONGS- AND- MAKE THIS ACT A MORE. FAIR MORE UNIFORMS- WERE MEANINGFUL FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO IT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE KNOW IT'S NOT A PANACEA. BUT WE KNOW IT WILL ENSURE THAT DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS FOR INVOLUNTARY. DETENTIONS COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS INCREASED OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. TO ENHANCE DATA COLLECTION.

ADDRESSES AFFORDABILITY PROVIDING BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL HELP TO CONSUMERS PURCHASING HEALTH COVERAGE THROUGH COVERED CALIFONIA ALLOWS COVERED CALIFORNIA TO OFFER PRODUCTS WITH LOWER OUT OF POCKET COSTS SPECIFICALLY ZERO DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER COST SHARING THESE PRODUCTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS EARNING UP 26100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY A POVERTY LEVEL. AND WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA'S MODELING OF DIFFERENT COST SHARING OPTIONS THIS BILL ALIGNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET THAT STATES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON OPTIONS TO FURTHER IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY AND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE WITH ME TODAY IS DIANA DOUGLAS WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA AND BIANCA BLOMQUIST THE SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DIANA DOUGLAS ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATEWIDE CONSUMER ADVOCACY HEALTH CARE COALITION. THANKS TO SIGNIFICANT PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PROVIDED FIRST BY THE STATE AND THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MORE CALIFORNIANS THAN EVER HAVE ENROLLED IN OUR COVERED CALIFORNIA MARKETPLACE. WE ARE PLEASED TO BE HERE TO SPONSOR AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY FURTHER REDUCE THE BURDEN BY ADDRESSING COST SHARING FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES. EVEN WITH COVERAGE RISING DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS KEEP CARE OUT OF REACH FOR MANY. FEELING WORRIED ABOUT OUT OF POCKET COSTS WHEN USING HEALTH INSURANCE A GREATER PERCENTAGE THAN THOSE WORRIED ABOUT COST OF HOUSING UTILITIES OR GROCERIES. THIS IS UNSURPRISING GIVEN DEDUCTIBLES OFTEN AMOUNT TO SEVERAL MONTHS WORTH OF WAGES. A PERSON IN A STANDARD SILVER PLAN MAKING JUST OVER TWO THOUSAND PER MONTH MAY HAVE A DEDUCTIBLE OF THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED. AND AMOUNT THAT WILL RISE TO FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED BY NEXT YEAR. THEY'LL BE PAYING FORTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A REGULAR DOCTOR VISIT TO SEE A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS OF LEAD TO HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS SKIPPING OR DELAYING CARE THIS PAST YEAR. AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WILL LIMIT DEDUCTIBLES FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES AND SILVER PLANS AND ALSO UPGRADE ALL SILVER ENROLLEES INTO MORE AFFORDABLE TEARS OF COST SHARING. THE BILL ALSO EXTEND CARSHARING HELP TO THOSE MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS MAKING ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER YEAR. WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT FEDERAL PREMIUM SUBSIDIES WILL BE EXTENDED LATER THIS YEAR WHICH GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS COST SHARING. WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO RESOLVE ANY OPERATIONAL ISSUES THAT MAY IMPACT TO THE SYSTEMS WE AIM TO PROVIDE. WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANKS TO THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED TO SUPPORT AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS THAT IMPROVES AFFORDABILITY FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THERE ARE OVER FOUR MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAKE UP 99% OF TOTAL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN HALF OF ALL ACA ENROLLEES NATIONWIDE ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES OR SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS. RECENT FEDERAL ACTION TO MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA ONE SOON TODAY THE STATE CAN TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE OUT OF POCKET COSTS THAT ARE HINDERING ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN OUR STATE. THE NEED FOR AFFORDABILITY AMONG CALIFORNIAN ENTREPRENEURS IS GROWING. KEEPING IN MIND THAT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA DEPEND ON THE JOBS PROVIDED BY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ACCORDING TO OUR RESEARCH MORE THAN ONE IN THREE SMALL BUSINESSES REPORT THAT IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE TO OBTAIN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES DURING THE PANDEMIC. 16% HAVE REPORTED THEY'VE CONSIDERED REDUCING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESSES OPEN. ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR WERE MORE LIKELY TO INDICATE MAKING THIS CHANGE. A STRONG AFFORDABLE MARKET PLACE IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA ENTREPRENEURS AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR. OVER THE CUT OFF FOR HEALTH CARE SUBSIDIES WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. PLUS OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 70% OF THOSE POLLED SUPPORT EXPANDING COST SHARING SUBSIDIES TO INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE UP LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF FEDERAL TAX CREDITS MORE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. CALIFORNIA MUST BEGIN TO ADDRESS ESCALATING COST SHARING AS AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT DOES. AND CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET WE MUST ACT TO SUSTAIN A STRONG RECOVERY FROM THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.
