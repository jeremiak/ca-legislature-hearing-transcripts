HEARING ENTITLED THE AGE OF WILD FIRES PRE AND POST WHILE FOR FIRE PLANNING. AND HOUSING DELIVERY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A TO NOTE THAT IT IS A WHILE FOR FIRE. AWARENESS WEEK AND I KNOW CAL FIRE IS PROMPTING A NUMBER OF EVENTS THIS WEEK TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF PREPARATION FOR WILD FIRES GOOD TIMING GUYS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK MY TWO CO CHAIRS ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM GRAY CHAIR OF THE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITTEE WE'RE HOPING YOU CAN JOIN US TODAY. AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE STAFF OF ALL THE COMMITTEES FOR ORGANIZING THIS HEARING. SECOND I'D LIKE TO PASS ON MY APPRECIATION TO OUR PANELISTS TODAY FOR JOINING US -- THIS AFTERNOON IT'S A BUSY TIME OF YEAR AND WHAT'S GOING ON AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. THE CONCEPT FOR THE HEARING AT LEAST FOR ME HAS BEEN. BREWING FOR A WHILE. I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE DEVASTATION OF SO MANY FOR OIL FIRES IN MY DISTRICT TOO MANY TO COUNT SINCE I WAS ELECTED IN THE ASSEMBLY. I'VE TALKED WITH TOO MANY CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES. WHERE FACE SO MANY CHALLENGES AND DIFFICULT DECISION POST WILDFIRE? I WANT TO WATCH STAR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS CITY COUNTY AND SPECIAL DISTRICT STAFF. AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS DOING EVERYTHING EVERYTHING THEY CAN AFTER A WHILE FOR FIRE TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS AND BEGIN TO HEAL. ARTICLES IN THE NEWSPAPER CALL THIS THE NEW NORMAL. THE REALITY OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA THE REALITY OF FIRES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I CAN'T HELP FEELING THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND DO BETTER PLANNING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BEFORE WE ACCEPT THIS NEW AT THIS NEW FATE. WITH THAT IN MIND WE'VE GATHERED THE EXPERTS FOR WHAT I THINK WOULD BE A GREAT INFORMATIONAL HEARING TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUES. OUR FIRST PANELIST WILL DISCUSS THE STATE'S ROLE IN PERSPECTIVE. THEY WILL HELP US TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE'S INTERACTION WITH LOCAL PLANS. AS WELL AS WHAT CAL FIRE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH ARE WORKING ON GIVEN THE LAST FEW USE. OF INCREDIBLE DEVASTATION. THE SECOND PANEL WILL LOOK AT ISSUES FROM A LOCAL LEVEL. WE WILL HEAR THE LAND USE OF PLANNING PERSPECTIVE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE WRIST PERSPECTIVE. FINALLY WE WILL CONSIDER THE TYPES OF ISSUES WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THAT AFFECTS THE OTHER CRISIS THE STATE IS FACING. A SHORTAGE OF HOUSING SUPPLY. AND HOW WE CAN ATTEMPT TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH WE NEED WHILE RESPECTING THE REALITY OF WILDFIRE RISK. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK BY CO AUTHORED ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR HIS REMARKS AND THEN OTHERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A REMARK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK ALL OF YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING ARE LIKE MY FELLOW CO CHAIR -- THIS IS A TOPIC THAT I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN THINKING ABOUT SINCE -- THE BEGINNING OF OF THE TRAGEDIES AND CERTAINLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I'VE HAD. MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES SOME OF THEM ARE HERE TODAY AND OTHERS OF US THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATURE REPRESENTING. DIFFERENT VULNERABLE PARTS OF OF OF THE STATE IN WHAT CAN WE DO TO AVOID FUTURE -- HORRIFIC TRAGEDIES -- WE ALL IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE AFTERMATH OF TRAGEDIES BUT I THINK PART OF TODAY'S HEARING. IS TO BOTH PLAN FOR WHAT WE DO IN THE AFTERMATH BUT HOW DO WE PREVENT IN IN THE FUTURE -- IT CERTAINLY IS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY ELEMENT COMMITTEE -- THERE ARE SPECIFIC ISSUES WITHIN THOSE TWO WORLDS OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY OUT MEANT THAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT. HOW DO WE ASSIST COMMUNITIES AND PLANNING FOR WILDFIRES HAD WE RESPOND AS A COMMUNITY ONCE A HAPPEN? AND HOW DO WE REBUILD QUICKLY OFFICIALLY AFTER DISASTER. WILDFIRES HAVE MADE OUR STATE HOUSING CRISIS WHICH IS ALREADY THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. EVEN MORE INTENSE WITH RECORD VACANCY RATES WITH INCREDIBLY HIGH RENTS WITH A RECORD NUMBER OF ON SHELTERED PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WE KNOW THAT THE STANDARD CHALLENGES TO BUILDING HOUSING WHICH ARE HIGH COSTS LABOR CHALLENGES SLOW LOCAL APPROVALS. ARE THE SAME IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED BY WILDFIRE BUT THERE INTENSIFIED AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU ADD TO THAT DISPLACED FAMILIES WERE FACING HOMELESSNESS OR OVERCROWDING. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE A STATE HOUSING DEFICIT -- SUCH THAT WERE BUILDING ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS A YEAR BUT WE NEED TO BE BUILDING OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS A YEAR. AND WHILE WE MOVE FOR POLICIES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO EXPEDITE HOUSING PRODUCTION TO HOLD CITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO BUILD THERE ARE OTHER UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO FACE WHEN IT COMES TO GRAPPLING WITH THE ISSUES THAT IS ARE THE SUBJECT OF TODAY'S HEARING. HOW DO WE DECIDE WHERE IT IS SMART TO BUILD AFTER A WILD FIRE HOW DO WE BUILD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ONCE WE DECIDE WHERE DOES THAT WE BUILD WHAT IS IT THAT WE REQUIRE A REBUILDING STANDARDS? AUTOMATION THIS YEAR MY HOPE IS WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING FORWARD A NUMBER OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BILLS. THAT FOCUS ON THE THREE PIECE OF HOW WE PRODUCE MORE HOUSING. HOW WE PRESERVE THE HOUSING WE HAVE AND HOW DO WE PROTECT THOSE RESIDENTS FROM BEING FORCED OUT OF THE HOUSING THAT THEY CURRENTLY ARE IN -- AND THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO REALLY SHOWCASE AND HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACED. IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE GRAPPLED WITH TOO MUCH SO WITH THAT AGAIN WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO HERE TODAY AND OPEN IT UP THERE ANY COLLEAGUES I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS. TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY. MR OUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND IN APPRECIATE TO BOTH YOU AND GERMAN AG AGUIAR-CURRY FOR HOLDING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TODAY -- YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW I'M. LIVE IN THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW -- AND AND I KNOW. THE CHAIR WOMAN HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS -- ALSO IN CINEMA AND LAKE COUNTIES AND SO. OBVIOUSLY I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS OR REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. BOTH -- HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF THESE DISASTERS -- AND AND CERTAINLY IT IS SIGNIFICANT MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW -- WITH THE CAMPFIRE -- AND THE DEVASTATION TO THE TOWN OF PARADISE Và GALIA CON CO -- YANKEE HILL. FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED AND YOU KNOW AS AS ARE A REPORT KIND OUTLINES THERE WAS ALREADY A HOUSING CRISIS IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS -- PRIOR -- TO THIS DISASTER BUT CERTAINLY WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU LOSE HOUSING THAT WAS HOUSING FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE -- IT IS BEATEN GREATLY EXACERBATED WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY PRECARIOUSLY HOUSE RIGHT NOW LIVING. WITH FAMILY MEMBERS. AND FRIENDS AT BEST -- BUT IT WORST INTENSE -- YELLOW HOMELESS -- TRYING TO FIND OUT HEY HOW DO WE MAKE THAT NEXT STEP IN AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOST IMMEDIATE THINGS IS HOW DO WE GET HOUSING DELIVERED -- YOU. AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE -- IN THESE REGIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MEANT THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY DEVASTATED -- SO THE PEOPLE WHO WHO WHO HAVE THEIR LIVES THERE THEY HAVE THEIR SCHOOL THEIR KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL. THERE YOU KNOW STILL EMPLOYED AT AT JOBS THEIR FAMILY AND CONNECTEDNESS COMMUNITY IS STILL ALL THERE THEY WANT TO STAY IN THE REGION BUT THERE'S A ZERO VACANCY RATE -- SO AND AND WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS AND OTHERS -- YES SOME GOOD POLICY PROCESS -- POLICIES AND BILLS THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THAT WERE THEIR HELP IN THAT THAT SITUATION -- BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM YOU KNOW AS AS AS BOTH OF YOU OUTLINED. YOU HOW CAN WE GET TO A BETTER PLACE IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FIRE RESILIENT THAT THEY'RE SAFE. THAT WE HAVE -- THIS COULD THIS CONVERSATION I CAN TELL YOU IS HAPPENING. IN PARADISE RIGHT NOW IS THERE PLANNING DOING THEIR PINE EFFORTS TO REBUILD THAT THEY WANT TO YOU KNOW ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITY IS BUILT. HOUSES ARE BUILT OUT OF BETTER MATERIALS -- THAT THEY'RE BETTER PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED DEFENSIBLE SPACE. IS NOT ONLY CONDUCTED BUT THEN AND FORCED -- AND YOU KNOW SO A LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO HEY FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE POLICIES THAT WILL ENSURE -- LONG TERM SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND PERHAPS JUST AS IMPORTANT MAYBE MORE IMPORTANT HOW DO WE GET OUT THE VEGETATION BUILD UP THAT WE HAVE IN OUR FORESTS AND AND WILD LANDS -- AND ENSURING THAT WERE REALLY GETTING ON TOP OF THAT BECAUSE WE COULD BE FACING. THE NEXT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IF WE DON'T AND SO WITH THAT I JUST THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND AND LOOKING. FOR TO FROM THE EXPERTS ON ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES. ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. YES. SOMERS TRANSFER. HOUSE ONE OF FOR FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER -- IN IN MY MISSPENT YOUTH WHICH SAVE LOS ANGELES THE HOUSE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS COORDINATOR FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND ALSO WAS. DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE AND MANY TIMES I WOULD COME. TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND ASK FOR FUNDING FOR BREAST PRIOR% CLEARANCE IN. AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND WE WOULD PUT IN. THE BUDGET ONE MILLION TWO MILLION FIVE MILLION TEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND BECAUSE IT WAS TOUGH TIMES IT WOULD. BE TAKEN OUT OF THE BUDGET AND I WOULD. INSIST THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE NOT LESS WE NEED NOT TO ZERO IT OUT BECAUSE ONE DISASTER WOULD COST. NOT ONLY IN LIVES BUT IN PROPERTY IN THE VALUE OF THOSE PROPERTIES WOULD. OUTWEIGH THAT ONE MILLION TWO MILLION DOLLARS AN AMOUNT OF MONEY WE COULD SAVE JUST BY -- LISTENING TO PEOPLE LIKE TO DEPARTMENT OH OH YES -- AND AND AND THEIR PLANS FOR HAZARD MITIGATION -- I DON'T THINK WE DO ENOUGH -- AND GOVERNMENT HAS A MITIGATION. BECAUSE WE TRY TO TAKE YOUR THINGS THERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES -- WE NEED TO DO MORE ABOUT LOOKING. FOR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS DOWN THE LINE WHEN WE KNOW. WITH JUST ONE MATCH WHEN CAMPFIRE IT COULD CAUSE THE DEVASTATION THAT WE'VE UNFORTUNATELY EXPERIENCED AND SO I'M I'M HERE. TO TO MAKE SURE THAT -- IS A VOICE. FOR FOR EARLY PLANNING -- OF OF MY STAFF MEMBER ASKED ME OF SORRY TALKING ABOUT A TIME WHERE WE CAN JUST TOTALLY STOP ALL OF THESE. FIRES LIKE I SAID KNOWS ABOUT MITIGATING. THE THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE AND THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED AND SO LIKE -- I APPLAUD YOU IN DOING THIS I'M HOPEFUL WE HAVE A PRESCRIPTION -- AND HOPEFULLY DISCUSSION HOW WE CAN FUND. MITIGATION EFFORTS SO THAT THE IMPACTS ON ON ON MY ON EACH OF YOU THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS DEVASTATION THAT WE CAN MITIGATE IT TO A POINT. WHERE WE CAN OVERCOME A LOT QUICKER AND FASTER THANK YOU? THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANY OF THAT ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK. OKAY SIGNAL ONE WE GO AHEAD AND INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL TO UP TO THE DíAS -- I'D LIKE TO ASK MEMBERS TO HOLD THE QUESTIONS TO THE END OF THE PANEL. AND WE WILL HAVE CHIEF THOMAS PORTER THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND MANAGEMENT SECTION. CHIEF MICHAEL RICH ONE STATE FARM ARE MARSHALL CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. ALSO I BELIEVE MARK ILA DO CHEESE HERE. THE OTHER IS. OF DIRECTOR OF GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. CAKE GORDAN. DIRECTOR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH SENIOR ADVISER TO THE GOVERNOR ON CLIMATE CHANGE. AND WILL HAVE THE NEW IN TARA CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROGRAM DIRECTOR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US EVERYBODY. THANK YOU CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THIS -- IMPORTANT COMMITTEE -- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND OPEN -- THIS IS TOM PORTER -- AND DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE -- IN FRAME -- KIND OF THE PICTURE AS WE SEE IT AND THANK YOU MEMBER STORIES PASSED IT JONES SAWYER -- YOU YOU HAD A LOT OF THE ITEMS THAT THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT I THINK IN THIS LONG RANGE KIND OF PLANNING -- PLACE THAT WE NEED TO BE -- SO. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS -- WELL FIRE WELL WILDFIRES ARE A NATURAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S A LANDSCAPE AND VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE LANDSCAPE -- THEY ARE BECOMING MORE -- PREVALENT ON THE ROUTE THE LANDSCAPE -- AND MUCH MORE DESTRUCTIVE -- THERE MANY -- MANY ISSUES THAT ARE CAUSING THAT -- AND IT WILL BE A KIND OF A ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH THAT'S NECESSARY IN ORDER. TO MITIGATE THE RISKS TO THE PEOPLE AND PROPERTY. OF THE STATE. I WELL WE ALSO ALLOW FOR SOME OF THE LANDSCAPE TO BURN AND REPLENISH ITS NATURAL STATE AS WELL. SO OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS -- WE'VE HAD THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE SEASONS AND I'M JUST GONNA JUST GONNA PUT IT IN IN -- STRUCTURE TERMS. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAD OVER TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES -- THAT BURNED DUE TO WILDFIRES. THAT WAS THE WORST IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN COMES AROUND. AND WE DOUBLE THAT MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND STRUCTURES BURNED IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE MOST -- OF DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY. WILDFIRES OCCURRED. OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE -- PASSED AWAY DUE TO WILDFIRE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SIX OF THOSE BEING FIRST RESPONDERS. A TRAGIC YEAR -- FOR SURE. SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A COMBINED EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- FIRE SUPPRESSION ACTIVITIES LAND USE PLANNING ACTIVITIES OVERGROWN -- FOREST AREAS. THAT HAVE NOT BEEN MANAGED OR ALLOWED FOR NATURAL MANAGEMENT THROUGH FIRE ACTIVITY -- AND THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO THESE LARGER AND MORE DAMAGING FIRES. THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE SEEING IS. A LOT OF GROWTH OF OF HUMAN ACTIVITY AND DEVELOPMENT INTO THESE AREAS. AND THAT'S HAPPENED OVER DECADES IT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT'S A NEW PROBLEM. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BECOMING VERY CLEAR TO US IS THAT THERE IS -- A VULNERABILITY ISSUE THAT WE DID NOT PREVIOUSLY REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT -- THE OLD VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- INCLUDING -- YOU PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVE MOBILITY ISSUES COMMUNICATIONS ISSUES -- OR EVEN A LACK OF OF TRANSPORTATION FEW CARS PER HOUSEHOLD -- MAYBE YOUNG CHILDREN. SCHOOL AGE AT HOME AND ARE NOT. OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITY DURING THE DAYTIME -- ALL OF THOSE ISSUES ARE ARE -- VERY KEY -- TO MITIGATING THIS PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE AND IT'S NOT JUST A RURAL PROBLEM. THERE CITIES THROUGHOUT -- CALIFORNIA THAT ARE VERY MUCH IN PERIL -- CLOSE TO US -- SANTA ROSA AS WE KNOW. GLARING EXAMPLE OAKLAND AS WELL AND MANY OTHERS [inaudible] SO. I WANT AYE IT'S NOT NOT ALL DESPAIR -- CAL FIRE AND THE OFFICES OF OF A STATE GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE RESPONSE -- RESPONSIBILITY -- INCLUDING -- CALLOW YES -- ARE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES TO PLAN FOR THESE ACTIVITIES THAT NEED TO BE DONE -- AND PREPARING FOR A RISK REDUCTION -- WELL IT'S NOT JUST FIRE RESPONSE -- IT INCLUDES -- HAZARD ASSESSMENT RISK ASSESSMENT -- AND THEN FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES DOING THOSE THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY FUELS MANAGEMENT. PRESCRIBED BURNING -- AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS. AND I THINK -- WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO I MEAN I I'M GONNA PASS THIS -- TO MY PARTNER. THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL -- MIKE RICH WINE -- TO TALK MORE ABOUT THOSE THOSE -- PLANNING AND KIND OF LONG RANGE -- PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ISSUES THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH. TWENTY THANK YOU CHIEF. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES GOOD AFTERNOON. A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU. OF THE ALSO THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL SUPPORTS THE FIRE PREVENTION MISSION OF CALIFORNIA -- THROUGH A WIDE VARIETY OF FIRE SAFETY RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDING REGULATING. LIFE SAFETY AND BUILDINGS WHICH PEOPLE LIVE CONGREGATE OR COMPLYING. WRITING STATEWIDE DIRECTION FOR FIRE PREVENTION WITH THEM WHILE AND AREAS. DEVELOPING IN REVIEWING REGULATIONS AND BUILDING STANDARDS AND PROVIDING TRAINING AND EDUCATION AND FIRE PROTECTION METHODS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. SINCE OUR FOCUS TODAY IS ON HOUSING AND THE THREAT TO HOUSING POSED BY WILDFIRE. I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE OUR PROGRAMS. THAT MOST DIRECTLY IMPACT THE SAFE DEVELOPMENT IN OCCUPANCY OF HOMES IN WELFARE PRONE AREAS. AND WHILE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS INDIVIDUALLY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT ADOPTING A WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRES A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH. IT REQUIRES PLANNING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARDENED AGAINST WILDFIRES WITH FEW BREAKS IN AND AROUND THE COMMUNITIES. ENSURING COMMUNITIES HAVE PROPER EVACUATION ROUTES WATER SUPPLIES IN FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES. IN BUILDING HOMES AT A TIMBER REDEEMER RESISTANT MATERIALS WHILE MAINTAINING A ONE HUNDRED FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE. BY REMOVING DEAD AN OVERGROWN VEGETATION WHICH ALSO AND ALSO EDUCATING THE PUBLIC TO PREVENT THE START AND SPREAD OF HUMAN BECAUSE WILDFIRES. WELL BEFORE HOUSES ARE BUILT IN COMMUNITIES ARE DEVELOPED THOUGH. WE IDENTIFY AND MAP FIRE HAZARD AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE AREAS ARE ZONES ARE MAPPED USING A SCIENCE BASED COMPUTER MODEL. THAT ASSIGNS A HAZARD SCORE BASED ON MANY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE FIRE LIKELIHOOD AND FIRE BEHAVIOR. THE FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE FIRE HISTORY. EXISTING AND POTENTIAL FUEL NATURAL VEGETATION. TOPOGRAPHY FLAME LINK BLOWING MEMBERS AND TYPICAL WEATHER FOR THE AREA. OUR FIRE RESOURCE ASSESSMENT PROGRAM. USES THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND DATED TO OF AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP AND FIELD TESTING MODEL. THAT IS USED TO IDENTIFY THREE INCREASING FIRE HAZARDS. MEDIUM HIGH IN VERY HIGH. WE HAVE BEGUN THE PROCESS FOR UPDATING THE FIRE HAZARD TO THEIR DESIGNS USING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES AND MAPPING. NEW MAPPING WILL INCLUDE NEW FACTORS INCLUDING. THE RECENTLY AND USE CHANGES NEW SIGNIFICANT WIND EVENT DATA AS WELL AS THE MODEL THAT IS MORE SPATIALLY DETAILED. TWO HUNDRED ACRES DOWN TO TWO ACRE PARCELS. MAPS ARE IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IN LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS. WHERE THE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE TRIGGERS WELL IN BUILDING CODES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION? OF COURSE THESE CODES APPLY TO ALL THREE ZONES IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. IT'S BEEN ASKED AT THESE MAPS SHOULD BE UPDATED MORE FREQUENTLY AND THE REALITY IS MOST OF THE FACTORS ARE CONSTANT. OVER THE YEARS AND ARE STILL RELEVANT. HOWEVER WE UPDATE THE MODEL IS NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE BECOMES AVAILABLE. AND FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE JUST NOW COMPLETING NEW DATA AVAILABLE ON SIGNIFICANT WHEN DEFENSE. THESE ISOLATED AND EXTREME WIND EVENTS HAVE BEEN THE ROOT OF SEVERITY. OF THE NORTH BAY FIRES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN THE CAMP FIRES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND BUTTE COUNTY. SO THIS NEW DATA ON MICRO CLIMATES IS AN IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT WILL REQUIRE RE MAPPING. AFTER FIRE HAZARDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THE LONG BEFORE CONSTRUCTION BEGINS. CAL FIRES LAND USE PLANNING PROGRAM WORKS WITH THE LOCAL PLANNING BUILDING AND FIRE OFFICIALS TO ASSIST THEM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAFETY ELEMENTS IN THEIR GENERAL PLAN. THE PROVIDE THEM WITH INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT THEY MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS BASED ON FIRE THREAT AND RISK IN THEIR AREA. THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED BY SENATE BILL TWELVE FORTY ONE SENATOR KEOGH IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND REQUIRES THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. TO REVIEW AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO SAFETY ELEMENTS TO ADDRESS THE RISK. OF FIRE IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. AND LOCAL RESPONSIBLE AREAS WITH VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARDS VERITIES OWNS. WE ARE IN CONTACT WITH FIFTY SIX COUNTIES AND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES IN THE STATE. AND THIS YEAR WE WILL BE ASSISTING THIRTY ONE COMMUNITIES TO UPDATE THEIR SAFETY ELEMENTS. AS A PART OF THEIR THEIR PLAN UPDATES. THE LAND USE PLANNING PROGRAM PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON STATE FIRE REGULATIONS. INCLUDING ROAD STANDARDS FOR FIRE EQUIPMENT ACCESS. STANDARDS FOR STREET SIGNS AND BUILDING IDENTIFICATION. MINIMUM PRIVATE WATERSUPPLY RESERVES FOR EMERGENCY USE. AND FUEL BREAKS IN GREEN BELTS. WE ALSO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH INCORPORATING WELFARE MITIGATION MEASURES IN OUR CAL FIRE UNIT PLANS. OUR LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS AND EVEN THE COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE PREVENTION PLANS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PLANNING ELEMENTS ARE ALL SINK IN CONSISTENT. WE'RE IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF OUR WORK WITH THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. IN REVIEWING SUBDIVISIONS AND WHILE IN AREAS BUILT WITHOUT SECONDARY EMERGENCY EGRESS. TO IMPROVE BOTH PUBLIC EVACUATIONS AND EMERGENCY ACCESS. AS A RESULT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN SPILL. AND THOSE POSITIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WHEN CONSTRUCTION OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSING IS READY TO COMMENCE? CALIFORNIA HELPS ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES ARE RESILIENT TO WILDFIRE THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT WHILE AND BUILDING AND FIRE CODES IN THE WORLD. AS YOU KNOW AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND NINE NEW BUILDINGS LOCATED IN ANY FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE WITHIN THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY AREA. IN VERY HIGH FIRE ZONES AND LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS. ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW BUILDING AND AND FIRE CODES. ARE KNOWN AS ARE WE WE CODES. THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE OR WE WE BUILDING CODES ARE REVIEWED EVALUATED AND AMENDMENTS ARE RECOMMENDED AT REGULAR INTERVALS. ARE WE WE COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVE OF BUILDING AND FOREST PRODUCTS MANUFACTURERS. BUILDING AND FIRE OFFICIALS ACADEMIA. THEY SERVE THE DEPARTMENT -- TO ADVISE A NEW AMBER RESISTANT PRODUCTS TECHNOLOGIES. AND EVEN BUILDING TECHNIQUES -- IN RECENT CO DEVELOPMENT CYCLE THROUGH THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION FIVE PROPOSALS FROM THE WE COMMITTEE WERE APPROVED. INCLUDING UL LISTED GARAGE DOOR WEATHER STRIPPING. AN AMBER RESISTANT SCREENS OVER SKYLIGHTS. AND OF COURSE. AS YOU KNOW THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION. IS HOW DO WE PROTECT THE TWO AND A HALF MILLION HOMES ESTIMATED. IN THE S. R.. THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL MAINTAINS A LIST OF UPGRADES THAT HOMEOWNERS IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS. CAN UNDERTAKE TO HARDEN OR MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE RESILIENT TO WILDFIRE WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING TO UPDATE THAT LIST. INCLUDING GETTING RID OF WOOD SHAKE SHINGLES WOOD SIDING AND REPLACING IT WITH AMBER RESISTANT BUILDING MATERIALS. A LOT OF REALLY. GREAT INFORMATION IS FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE. READY FOR WILDFIRE DOT ORG SLASH HARDENING YOUR HOME. WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING A LOW COST BUILDING RETROFIT LIST. WE THINK IT'LL BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL GUIDE TO HOMEOWNERS -- THAT WILL HARDEN THE HOME AGAINST WELFARE EMBERS. BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EDUCATE AND INCENTIVIZE HOMEOWNERS TO UPGRADE THEIR HOMES THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE THE NEW. WE WE BUILDING AND FIRE CODES. THE SEPARATE MUST BE COMMUNITY BASED TO AVOID IN CONSISTENT APPLICATION. BECAUSE WHEN ONE HOME IS COMPLIANT IN THE NEIGHBORS NEXT DOOR AREN'T -- BOTH HOMES ALL HOMES ARE STILL AT RISK -- MORNING IS A CRITICAL STEP IN MAKING A COMMUNITY FIRE RESISTANT. IN FACT OR DAMAGE INSPECTION ANALYSIS OF WILDFIRES HAS SHOWN THAT 93% OF ALL THE STRUCTURES THAT CATCH FIRE. IN A WILDFIRE WILL BE DESTROYED. REPORTER RETURNED BACK TO YOU. I THANK YOU CHIU CHEAPER RICH -- ONE AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS KIND OF FRAME THIS BACK -- TO KIND OF JUST. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE SIMPLE TERMS OF WHAT ALL THIS MEANS -- THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNICAL WORK THAT'S GOING ON IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND IN THE THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT. WHAT -- WILD FIRE CAN AND WILL DO UNDER CERTAIN WEATHER CONDITIONS AND AND FUELS CONDITIONS AND ALL THOSE THINGS. AND SO -- WELL WELL -- WE'RE WORKING HARD I DILIGENTLY ON THAT -- WHAT WE ARE ALSO DOING AT SAME TIME IS NOW TAKING THAT INFORMATION -- MAKING IT MORE DIGESTIBLE TO THE PUBLIC -- LOOKING -- FOR AT WAYS OF OF UTILIZING OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR OUR COMMUNICATIONS SHOPS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. TO REALLY -- FOR REALLY BETTER AND DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS THAT'S THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN THE LANDOWNERS RESPONSIBILITY -- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE VERY MUCH ARE DOING THIS WEEK -- WITH WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS WEEK AND HEALTH -- PEOPLE GOING THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- EDUCATING THE PUBLIC BOTH THROUGH THE MEDIA BUT ALSO TO THOSE THAT ARE ARE ATTENDING THESE EVENTS -- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE'RE LOOKING TO DECREASE AND MITIGATE THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY WHAT HAPPENED TO BE MOSTLY HUMAN CAUSED EVENTS THESE FIRES. AND SO PART OF THAT IS EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ON WHAT THEY CAN AND NEED TO BE DOING TO ENSURE THAT. THAT WE AS HAS PEOPLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT OR NOT CAUSING THESE FIRES. SO THAT THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO TO THE THE MESSAGING. 95% OF THOSE FIRES ARE CAUSED BY HUMANS WILDFIRES [inaudible] SO. WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING IN THAT IN THAT SPACE -- YOU FOR THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND I'M I'M NOT GONNA TAKE -- I'M NOT GONNA MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY IT AGAIN BUT READY SET GO IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE TEACHING -- BECAUSE READY IS WHAT YOU DO AS A PERSON NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN CALIFORNIA TO GET PREPARED. FOR EMERGENCIES HAVE. PREPARED -- FOR ANY KIND OF EVENT THAT MAY HAPPEN EARTHQUAKE WHILE FIRE PILE POWER OUTAGES. ALL OF IT. WINTER STORMS -- THAT AND THAT IS -- THAT'S THE GET READY AND YOU NEED TO DO THE SAME FOR WILDFIRE PLAN YOUR EVACUATE EVACUATION ROUTES ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS -- HAVE HAVE ALL OF YOUR COMMUNICATION PLANS WITH YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND ACTUATION KITS READY TO GO. OR EMERGENCY KITS -- SET IS WHEN WE'RE IN BIG CONDITIONS THAT THAT WARRANT. RED FLAG WARNINGS -- JUST BEING THERE AND BEING -- THE PEAK FIRE SEASON FOR MOST OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE THE STUFF READY TO GO THE SET. AND WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO. IT'S TIME TO GO AND GO AND GO EARLY -- SO RELATED TO THAT -- AND THEY FURTHER THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES -- CAL FIRE DEVELOPED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AN APP -- THAT IS READY FOR WILD FIRE -- IT CAN BE -- YOU CAN SEARCH CAL FIRE ON ANY ANY APPS STORE -- ON YOUR WHATEVER YOUR PREFERRED MOBILE DEVICES AND YOU CAN GET -- YOU CAN GET VERY DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO DO EVERYONE OF THESE THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY -- HARDENING YOUR HOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- EVACUATION OF PLANNING COMMUNICATIONS PLANS. GETS ALL OF THAT IS ON THIS APP AND AND YOU CAN TRACK YOUR PROGRESS IN MEETING YOUR GOALS TOWARD MEETING THAT [inaudible] THE NEXT THING. MOVING OUTSIDE OF THE THE HUMAN AND TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE STRUCTURE. IS DEFENSIBLE SPACE WE NEED. EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR DEFENSIBLE SPACE EVERYBODY. IS LIKE HARDENING HOMES IF 90% DO AND 10% DON'T. THAT 10% IS GOING -- TO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SOME OF THE OTHER 90% PROBABLY NOT ALL OF IT FOR MAYBE. SO WHAT YOU YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW IS THAT WE WE FIND AT THAT AND WE'RE TRYING TO TOUCH EVERY -- EVERY HOPE HOUSEHOLD ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS WE ARE NOT MEETING THAT BUT THAT IS THE THE GOAL -- WE FIND THAT -- 82% OF OF OUR FIRST INSPECTIONS ARE COMPLIANT INSPECTIONS. AND BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE THIRD INSPECTION -- 92% OF ALL STRUCTURES ARE MEETING THAT -- THAT COMPLIANCE. IT DOESN'T MEAN EVERY. PROPERTY IS COMPLIANT. SO. FROM THERE WE NEED TO MOVE INTO THE KIND OF THE THE WE WE THE THAT ZONE THAT IS BETWEEN THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND WHAT I'LL CALL THE WOODS OR THE BACK COUNTRY. OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN THEN WHERE WE HAVE DANCE HOUSING. DEVELOPMENTS MAYBE THERE'S A HOUSE EVERY FIVE TO TEN ACRES BUT THAT'S KIND OF OUT THERE THIS WILL EASE OWN IN BETWEEN -- THE THE CONSTRUCTED AREA OR THE OR THE BUILT OUT AREA AND AND THOSE MORE WERE OF RURAL AREAS -- WE NEED TO DO OF LANDSCAPE LEVEL FUEL STREETS [inaudible] AND THE GOVERNOR KNEW SOME -- ORDERED -- THE CALIFORNIA YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE WOULD DO THOSE IN THE SHORT TERM THIS YEAR THIS SEASON -- IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RISK TO THE VULNERABLE -- ELEMENTS OF COMMUNITIES WHICH I WAS MENTIONING PREVIOUSLY. AND WE DID WE PUT THOSE SCREENS OVER -- OUR PLANNING PROCESS WE CAME UP WITH THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS THAT WE COULD GET DONE THIS YEAR -- THAT NEEDED TO GET DONE THIS YEAR TO PROTECT -- VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES OF TWO HUNDRED PLUS -- COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THE IMPORTANT THING THAT IS DIFFERENT IS THIS SOCIO ECONOMIC AND MOBILITY SCREEN THAT WE PUT OVER IT. SO IT'S NOT EVERY COMMUNITY THAT'S IMPERIL TO WATCH WILDFIRE. BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY THE COOLEY THOSE THAT HAVE VULNERABLE. ELEMENTS WHERE WE COULD HAVE CATASTROPHIC SITUATIONS OCCUR A FIRE RUNS THROUGH THOSE AREAS MEETING. LOSS OF LIFE [inaudible] SO. WE'VE UNDERTAKEN THOSE PROJECTS THE OTHER SCREENING ELEMENT OF THOSE PROJECTS WERE THEY THEY DID NOT HAVE SEEK WHAT ON SO. THE REQUIREMENT WAS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY -- DECLARED IN ORDER -- TO UNDERTAKE THEM. WE DID THAT -- THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS WHILE THEY DO NOT HAVE A FORMAL SEEK WHAT PROCESS. ALL OF THAT PLANNING AND ALL OF THAT REVIEW PROCESS IS TAKING PLACE -- UNFORTUNATELY WE WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO DO THE THE PUBLIC SCREENING OF THAT BUT WE DID DO THE THE WORK ON THAT TWENTY EIGHT OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS ARE ARE -- BEING ACTED ON NOW AND THE OTHER SEVEN ARE IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING FINAL APPROVAL. NEXT FACE. LANDSCAPE LEVEL THE CARBON PLAN -- CALIFORNIA CARBON PLAN. FIRST CARBON PLAN CALLS FOR A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF OF TREATMENT -- BY A THAT STATE AGENCIES AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS -- IN -- EVERY YEAR. STARTING IN ABOUT -- TWO THOUSAND I'M -- TO TWO THOUSAND THIRTY IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT AND YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THE GAP FROM WHERE WE ARE WITH THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS. AND START TO DO THESE PROJECTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IS WE NEED TO GET THE CAL -- CALVI T. P. WHICH IS CALIFORNIA VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAMMATIC HE I ARE APPROVED -- IT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY THIS YEAR -- WE EXPECT BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR WE WILL TEAR ALL OF OUR FUELS REDUCTION PROJECT WORK. UNDER THAT SEQUEL COMPLIANT DOCUMENT -- FOR FOR THE FUTURE SO THAT'S WHERE WE BRIDGE AND WE STOP HAVING TO CALL IT -- CALL OUT EMERGENCIES FOR THESE FUEL REDUCTION PROJECT WORK -- LAST THING. IS RELATED TO GRANT GRANT PROJECTS -- IN THE WE WE AREA WE HAVE -- WE HAVE GRANTED -- FOR FIRE PREVENTION -- GRANT TYPE PROJECTS -- ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS -- FUNDS TO DO THAT THAT WE WE TYPE. LANDSCAPE LEVEL BUT CLOSE TO THE STRUCTURES AND CLOSE TO THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT WORK -- WE HAVE HAD WE HAVE GRANTED ANOTHER -- ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FOREST HEALTH GRANT. GRANTS AND THAT'S TO DEVELOP THAT RESILIENCE OUT IN THE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE WHERE WE ARE PROTECTING WATERSHEDS WILDLIFE -- AIR QUALITY -- AND AND ALL OF THOSE NATURAL RESOURCES AND REDUCING THE THREAT OF FIRE COMING OUT OF THOSE AREAS INTO THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT [inaudible] IN CONCLUSION. WE ARE REALLY DESCRIBING FOR YOU TODAY A AND ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH. WE NEED TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS. THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET. THIS IS THIS IS A DEFINITELY A PLACE WHERE WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH EVERYTHING YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ON ALL PANELS TODAY -- IN A SYSTEMATIC BUT ALSO -- ALL OF THE ABOVE TYPE OF WAY. AND THAT WILL. DEVELOP A RESILIENT. FIRE SKATE FOR CALIFORNIA AND FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- VERY INFORMATIVE AGAIN WE'LL WAIT IF FOR SOME OF THE MEMBERS TODAY WILL BE TAKING QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL -- GOOD AFTERNOON MR GOING TO CHI. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AND WE'RE NOT IN A FIRE ALL RIGHT GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON. THAT'S SO WRONG WITH THAT. GET OUR TECHNICAL PEOPLE OVER HERE TO FIX THAT FOR YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE THE MARKET RDG DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES -- THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I LET ME LET ME START OFF BY JUST [inaudible] REALLY. CAPITALIZING ON JI PORTER CHI FOR TRANS COMMENTS THEY HEADED SPOT ON I MEAN THE AND AND WE KNOW. AS WELL WE'RE ALL WORKING THROUGH THESE -- COMPLEX -- AND REALLY YOU KNOW THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE DISASTER THREE SENIOR WHICH IS REALLY DRIVEN HOME THE THE POINT THAT THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE HERE TODAY AND THAT IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE NEED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY IN OUR COMMUNITY PLANNING WE NEED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY IN OUR COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS-- WE NEED TO BUILD CAPACITY WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES TO PREPARE FOR THESE KINDS OF DISASTERS AND TODAY WE'RE FOCUSING ON WALL FIRE BUT YOU KNOW NEXT WEEK AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT EARTHQUAKE SO. WERE WERE CERTAINLY DISASTER PRONE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF REST THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. AND SO YOU KNOW COLLECTIVELY ALL OF THESE EFFORTS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT -- TRULY OUR OUR SPA ARE SPOT ON AND YOU KNOW NO ASKED WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR WITH OUR OTHER STATE AGENCY PARTNERS BUT WERE ALSO VERY MUCH ENGAGED WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WHICH IS REALLY YOU KNOW THEY SAY ALL THIS ACTORS ARE LOCAL AND IT REALLY IS WHERE. WHERE COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW THRIVE WHERE PEOPLE GO TO WORK AND GO TO CHURCH AND SHOP AND AND AND AND THAT AND IT'S AT THAT PLACE THAT? WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BY DOWN THE REST CAN WE DO THAT IN CALIFORNIA REALLY -- THROUGH -- HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING AND AND IN FACT -- BOB WHERE THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES DON'T. EXPERIENCE THESE LARGE SCALE DISASTERS TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY HAVE IS TO PRIORITIZE AND WHERE APPLICABLE FIND HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS -- IT'S IT'S NOT. EXCLUSIVELY A GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY IT'S A WHOLE OF COMMUNITY APPROACH PUBLIC PRIVATE NON GOVERNMENTAL THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FAITH BASED AND THE CITIZENS ALL COMING TOGETHER. TO WORK TOGETHER AS CHIEF PORTER SAID ALL OF THE THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR HAVE TO COME TOGETHER -- IN AN EFFORT THIS IS THIS IS A THIS IS A WHOLE OF COMMUNITY APPROACH AND AND REALLY WHAT IS MITIGATION IT IT IT IS THE IS THE EFFORT TO REDUCE LIFE. A LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY -- BY LESSENING THE IMPACTS OF THE DISASTER WE'RE BUYING DOWN WHAT THE IMPACTS WE'RE NOT GOING TO PREVENT THE DISASTER FROM HAPPENING. BUT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO BUY DOWN THE IMPACTS OF THE DISASTER AND AS WE'VE SEEN IN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN UP AND DOWN THE STATE IT'S IT'S AN R. M. YOU KNOW WHY WE RESPOND TO ALL OF THESE IN SUCH A TREMENDOUS WAY. TRULY THE ACHILLES HEEL OF ANY THESE DISASTERS IS THE RECOVERY IT'S THE COMPLEX -- ABILITY TO GET PEOPLE'S LIVES BACK UP ONLINE THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND AND HELPING OUR PARK OUR COMMUNITIES RECOVER -- THAT CAN BE LESSENED SIGNIFICANTLY BY STRONG HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND REALLY THERE'S MEDICATION IS IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT FORMS AS PRE DISASTER MITIGATION THAT'S THAT'S THE EFFORTS THAT CAN BE PUT IN -- DURING AB A BEFORE AN EVENT ACTUALLY OCCURS AND THEN -- POST DISASTER MITIGATION WHERE WE'RE LEARNING FROM WHAT OCCURRED -- MUCH LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY -- AND BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL EFFORTS -- TO BUY DOWN ANY FUTURE RISKS -- THE FIRST PART OF THAT OF COURSE IS UNDERSTANDING -- THE WHAT WHAT RISKS KIRK AND OUT AGAIN IS AB AND SO ARTICULATELY CHEAP FOR AND SHE FOR TRIED LAID OUT IS. IS THEY THEY REALLY TALKED ABOUT THE RISKS THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE -- THE REPORT THAT CHIEF PORTER TALKED ABOUT GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S REPORT AND BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE THOSE -- THOSE THIRTY FIVE PRIORITY -- LOCATIONS AND AND BY DOWN THE RISK. ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS THEY NEED. TO GO INTO -- THEIR COMMUNITIES WORKING WITH THEIR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT THEIR FIRE DEPARTMENT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE ROB PUBLIC SERVICES AND REALLY DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR COMMUNITY TO FIND. OUT WHERE THE HIGHEST CHRIS ARE AND THEN PRIORITIZE -- UP POTENTIAL MITIGATION PROJECTS WHERE THEY CAN START TO BUY DOWN THOSE. THOSE RISKS -- IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WILDLAND FIRE AND OF COURSE -- I TEACH SHE'S RATE RETRY REALLY. LAID OUT A GREAT NUMBER OF OF THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT -- A VENT. IN CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE THE STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. THAT PLAN REPRESENTS THE STATE'S PRIMARY HIT -- HAZARD MITIGATION GUIDANCE OF FOR NOT ONLY JUST ALL THE STATE AGENCIES BUT ALSO FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- IT PROVIDES -- AN UPDATED ANALYSIS OF THE STATE'S HISTORICAL AND CURRENT HAZARDS. HAZARD MITIGATION GOALS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES AND WHAT ACTIONS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE THE MOVE FORWARD -- IT SETS UP -- THE PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIES FOR ALL OF THE FUNDING THAT WE MAY GET. FOR HAS MITIGATION AND UP IT ALSO DESCRIBES HOW RISK ASSESSMENTS AND MITIGATION STRATEGY INFORMATION IS COORDINATED AND LINK BETWEEN LOCAL. GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT -- LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS AND THE STATE AS MITIGATION PLAN AND PROVIDES A A RESOURCE FOR OR LOCAL PLANNERS -- OF RISK INFORMATION AND AND THAT MAY AFFECT THE PLANNING AREA. THIS IS ALSO DONE IN COORDINATION WITH OUR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WHICH IS WORKING ON LAND USE PLANNING SO THE IDEA IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GENERAL PLAN AND THE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN THEY COME TOGETHER. THEY LINK TOGETHER AS DEVELOPMENT STARTS -- TO BE CONSIDERED -- THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT DEVELOPMENT IT SHOULD GO FORWARD AND THEY'RE PUTTING A MITIGATION EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. DEVELOPMENT OUR COMMUNITY IS AS RESILIENT AS POSSIBLE MOVING FORWARD. IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT DISASTER SO THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORTS AND ACTIONS DEPENDING ON WE'RE A COMMUNITY IS SITTING OR INDIVIDUAL IS SITTING WITH THEIR HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM. INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO MISSION PLANS BUT AS CHIEF FOR MY MENTION INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES REALLY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL. TO LOOK AT THE RISKS THAT EXIST AROUND THEIR HOUSE THEIR HOME THEIR PROPERTY. AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT IT IS THAT THEY CAN DO TO START TO BUY DOWN THE REST A SIMPLE THING IS DEFENSIBLE SPACE. RIGHT BUT IT COULD ALSO BE -- BASIC RETROFITTING OF YOUR HOME IF YOU LIVE IN THE MOVIE -- IN THE WILD AND LAND URBAN INTERFACE AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A SPECIFIC PARTICULAR RASK -- TO ENSURE THAT YOU'VE DONE SOME BASIC MITIGATION EFFORTS TO YOUR HOME -- ISSUES SHOULD THERE BE A FIRE IN THE AREA TO BUY DOWN THAT RISK. IN IN IN THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WHEN I STOCK ABOUT HALL OF COMMUNITY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE HAZARD MITIGATION FUNDING. THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE FROM THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY MAY GO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE COULD HELP INDIVIDUALS -- THROUGH -- GRANTS -- OR DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMS TO HELP DO THAT RETROFITTING TYPE PROGRAM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS ANOTHER KEY PLAYER AND ALL OF THIS AND THAT AND A KEY PLAYER IN THAT. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST TO ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS -- HAVE AS RESILIENT A HOME AS POSSIBLE TO THE KIND OF RISKS THAT THEY FACE WHETHER YOU LIVE ON AN EARTHQUAKE FAULT -- AND YOU RICH FOR YOUR HOME FOR A POTENTIAL EARTHQUAKE WELL YOU LIVE IN THE WILD LAND FIRE AREA RETROFITTING YOUR WHOLE FOOTBALL FIRE IS A PRUDENT RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO. AND IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO HELP HOMEOWNERS BE ABLE TO GET THERE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. ARE IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THE THE PLAN CALIFORNIA OUR STATE HAS MITIGATION PLAN WAS JUST UPDATED APPROVED IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW IT -- IF IT IS ALSO FOLDED IN ALL OF THE CLIMATE IMPACTS INTO THE PLANNING ACTIVITIES -- IN FACT -- IT HAS THE MOST EXTENSIVE CLIMATE SCIENCE AND STRATEGIES THAN ANY OTHER PLAN IN THE NATION AT THIS POINT. WITH REGARDS OF A CURRENT -- SCIENCE UNDERSTANDING AND WHAT WE'VE WE'VE PUT INTO THE A PROGRAM. AND BECAUSE OF THE HISTORIES OF DISASTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- YOU KNOW ENCOURAGING COMMUNITIES TO ADOPT THEIR LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. EARLY IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR US -- IN FACT YOU BE SURPRISED THAT -- OR MAYBE NOT THAT -- WHEN THESE DISASTERS YET WE STILL HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE UP TO DATE HAS A MEDICATION PLAN OR HOW FAST MITIGATION PLAN? AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IT'S A PRIORITY FOR AS IS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR US TO GET COMMUNITIES -- FOCUSED ON THEIR HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN -- AND THEN MAKE SURE THIS TIED TO THAT GENERAL PLAN -- IN FACT THE FEDERAL DISASTER MITIGATION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND DOES REQUIRE THAT STAGE REVIEW LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS AS PART OF THEIR STATE. HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING PROCESS WHICH WE DO WHEN WE WENT AWAY AT YES -- THE INTENT OF THAT IS THREE FULL FIRST IS TO GATHER HAZARD VULNERABILITY AND MITIGATION INFORMATION FROM OUR LOCAL -- LEVEL AND AND USE IT FOR STATE LEVEL PLANNING. SECOND IS TO ENSURE THE STATE LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING IS COORDINATED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT. PRACTICAL AND THIRD IS TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE MADE AWARE. OF THE HAZARD -- HASN'T VULNERABILITIES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION AND TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THOSE VULNERABILITIES -- SO. WE GET FUNDING THROUGH FEMA TYPICALLY SO THERE'S A COUPLE WAYS WE GET FUNDING TO SUPPORT HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAMS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL -- WHEN WE HAVE A FEDERALLY DECLARED DISASTER IN CALIFORNIA --% ROUGHLY BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND 20% OF THE TOTAL COST OF THAT DISASTER IS COMES BACK TO THE STATE. IN THE FORM OF FUNDING FOR HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GET THEM TO IDENTIFY IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC FOR ANY. PARTICULAR TYPE OF DISASTER. WHEN HAS A MITIGATION FUNDS COMMAND IT'S UP TO US TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF HOW HOW WE WANT TO USE THOSE FUNDS -- BUT WE WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SEEK THEM TO APPLY FOR GRANTS THAT WE CAN -- WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON FOR EXAMPLE -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAD SIXTY SIX MITIGATION PROJECTS -- THAT -- TOTALED CLOSE TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WE THEN MOVE THOSE MITIGATION -- PROJECTS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY WERE FUNDED BY FEMA AS PART OF THE FEDERAL DOES -- HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAD AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT PROJECTS -- TOTALING CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS AND THESE PROJECTS RANGED FROM -- SOMEWHERE SEISMIC IN NATURE SOMEWHERE DROUGHT POST DROUGHT RELATED IN NATURE -- SOMEWHERE -- WILDFIRE IN NATURE COMMENTS SO WE WE WE LOOK AT WHERE THE PRIORITIES EXIST FOR THE STATE BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY HIGH RISK -- CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA FROM NATURAL DISASTER IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHILE WE'RE FOCUSING ON HIGH PRIORITY WE ALSO NOT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT. ALL OF THESE RICH THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. IN ADDITION WE HAVE A SEVERAL ONGOING FIRE MITIGATION PROJECTS FROM MULTIPLE EVENTS IN THE PAST INCLUDING YOU KNOW PROJECTS LIKE -- RETROFITTING OF WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FOLLOWING THE FIRES IN MENDOCINO COUNTY IN -- TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND WORK IN THE NORTH BAY -- AND SANTA ROSA WE WE GET WEEK BUT I RELATED TO REVEGETATION SLOPE ARE WE PLANTING MEDICATION TO WATERSHED. AREAS -- IN MARIPOSA COUNTY -- ECCENTRIC. AND OF AT IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- SORRY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- DID CHANGE UP THEIR THEIR POSTURE ON HAZARD MITIGATION AND THE THE PRESIDENT DID SIGN IT INTO LAW THE DISASTER RECOVERY REFORM ACT -- AND THIS PARTICULAR ACT -- ALLOWS FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PRE DISASTER FUNDING WHICH WE HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT GOT IN CALIFORNIATO ANY DEGREE -- PRE DISASTER FUNNY NOW IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION. I TO COMPETITIVE PROCESS THAT CALIFORNIA IS APPLYING -- FOR TO BE ABLE TO GET -- A SHARE OF THE MONEY BUT THESE ARE THESE ARE -- TO DO MITIGATION PROJECTS IN ADVANCE OF A DISASTER WHICH IS VERY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT PLAYS INTO WHAT A LOT OF CAL FIRE IS DOING NOW IN BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY HIGH RISK AREAS. AND BEING ABLE TO PUT FUNDING AND CAPABILITIES -- BEHIND THOSE THOSE PRE EVENT -- PROGRAMS SO -- I JUST SAVE -- INC IN CLOSING YOU KNOW IS A FOCUS ON HOW TO MITIGATION. PLANNING IS ANOTHER PIECE -- MOB PART OF THE A LOCAL PLANNING -- INCLUDES -- EVACUATION PLANNING ON HAVING AN UPDATED EMERGENCY PLAN -- THAT REFLECTS THE CURRENT RISK THAT COMMUNITIES FACE -- THESE ARE PLANS THAT SHOULD BE ALL HAZARD IN NATURE A CHEAPER MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT BUT OUR OUR PLANS ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE GOING TO DEAL WITH ALL THE KINDS OF DISASTERS ARE GOING TO FACE -- SO THAT THERE'S AYE AYE NOW IF OF ATTENTION GIVEN TO DO WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES HOW WE THOUGHT THROUGH THE RESILIENCY AND CAPACITY OF OUR COMMUNITY. DO WE HAVE A AFFECTED ENOUGH EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER CAPABILITY. IF I DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCE TO I KNOW WHERE TO GET THEM. AND THEN OUR ABILITY TO RAPIDLY AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TRANSITION FROM RESPONSE INTO RECOVERY MODE WHICH INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM HOUSING -- TOO YOU KNOW -- INFRASTRUCTURE REBUILDING -- KEY THINGS LIKE WATERS IN SEWERS AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT GET DAMAGED AFTER A DISASTER. THERE ARE. LITERALLY A MILLION CASCADING. ISSUES FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER OF THAT THAT WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. HOPING TO THINK THROUGH AS MANY OF THOSE. AS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF OUR LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT IS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY -- AND EFFICIENTLY RECOVER FROM AN EVENT LIKE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GOOD AFTERNOON MISS CORDON WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH. I SO I'M K&lt;c.cyan&gt; GORDON AND THE&lt;/c&gt; DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH WHICH ALSO HOUSES THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WHICH I CHAIR I'M ALSO THE GOVERNOR SENIOR ADVISER ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO. IN THOSE MULTIPLE ROLES I HAVE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATION OVER THE LAST HUNDRED DAYS ABOUT FIRE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE -- THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE THREE COMMITTEES FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AND THOSE OF OVERALL CLIMATE -- OVERLAY OF THIS OF THIS TOPIC DURING THE WILDFIRE AWARENESS WEEK AND I THINK WHAT WHAT ALSO A REALLY BUILDS ON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING -- FROM MY COLLEAGUES -- TO MY LEFT. SO AS IN THE VARIOUS ROLES THAT I PLAY IN PARTICULARLY THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WE DO A LOT OF WORK ACROSS ALL OF THESE AREAS PARTICULARLY ON I PLANNING IN LAND USE WHICH I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT BUT ALSO THE INTERSECTION WHICH YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING -- AND EMPHASIZED PARTICULARLY CHURCH YOU ON OF HOUSING -- AND TRANSPORTATION ON THESE ISSUES. HOW WE INTEGRATE THESE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT OF RISK AND RESILIENCE INTO OUR LONG TERM HOUSING? AND PLANNING IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR THE STATE GOING FORWARD AND ONE THAT I THINK WILL REALLY SHAPE CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. LET ME GIVE A QUICK OVERVIEW FIRST OF OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH IS ROLE IN LONG TERM PLANNING WE EXISTENCE STATUTE AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW AS THE LONG TERM PLANNING AGENCY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE CABINET. AS A RESULT OF THAT ROLE WE END UP DOING A LOT OF WORK SORT OF AT A HIGH LEVEL ON GENERAL PLANNING CLIMATE RESILIENCE -- WE ALSO AS YOU KNOW I'VE MANAGED TO SEE WHAT GUIDELINES BUT WE ALSO DO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK INTERACTING DIRECTLY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DEPARTMENTS AND SPENDS THE MOST TIME TALKING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SO WE'RE IN A PRIVILEGED POSITION TO REALLY. HEAR ALL THE TIME ABOUT HOW THESE POLICIES AT A HIGH LEVEL ARE INTERACTING AT A LOCAL LEVEL. WHICH I THINK IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS. WE'RE IN TODAY IN TERMS OF PLANNING. OPR PRODUCES THE GENERAL MIND GUIDELINES -- WHICH GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE INFORMATION AND THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO DEVELOP A LONG RANGE PLANS AND BLUEPRINTS FOR HOW THEIR COMMUNITIES WILL GROW. AND DEVELOP GIVE AND POPULATION PROJECTIONS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTIONS LAND PROJECTIONS -- THE GENERAL PLANS AS YOU MAY KNOW -- INCLUDE BOTH REQUIRED ELEMENTS SO YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH IS A REQUIRED ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN ALSO RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDED ELEMENTS THERE'S A CLIMATE ELEMENT FOR INSTANCE WHICH IS RECOMMENDED. AND DATA TOOLS AND WE AT OPR DO A LOT OF WORK HELPING PEOPLE KIND OF SORT. THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE UP TO DO THE GENERAL PLANS HAPPEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN INCLUDED. FIVE EIGHT AND IMPORTANT FOR THIS CONVERSATION GUIDANCE FOR CLIMATE INCORPORATING CLIMATE CHANGE INTO THOSE. GUIDELINES WE ALSO. AS YOU HEARD FROM DIRECTOR GO GEE GEE WE'RE WE'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN WORKING WITH WITH HIS OFFICE ON THE HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS WE ALSO HELP COMMUNITIES WITH THE SAFETY ELEMENT. OF THE GENERAL PLAN WHICH IS A MANDATORY ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN AND THAT INCLUDES SPECIFICALLY CONSIDERATIONS FOR WILD FIRE HAZARDS AS WELL AS OTHER HAZARDS. IN THE STATE IN THE SAFETY ON OF THE GENERAL PLANS COMMUNITIES MUST IDENTIFY FIRE HAZARD STONE'S. EXISTING AND PLANNED DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE AREAS OF HIGH FIRE HAZARD AND IDENTIFY THE AGENCIES AND SORT OF THAT RESPONSE PLANNED OUT RESPONSIBLE FOR FIRE PROTECTION. AND THE GOAL THAT SAFETY ALLMAN IS REALLY TO PROTECT COMMUNITY FROM UNREASONABLE RISKS SITE ESSENTIAL FACILITIES AWAY FROM HIGHEST SO IF FIRE HAZARD DOES WHEN POSSIBLE INTAKE MITIGATION MET MEASURES TO REDUCE RISK TO CURRENT STRUCTURES. WE ALSO -- I SHOULD SAY THAT SB THREE SEVENTY NINE PASSED BY SENATOR JACKSON IN TWENTY FIFTEEN REQUIRED UPDATES TO THE SAFETY ELEMENT. TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT INTERSECTION IN A MINUTE -- BUT THAT UPDATE. NEEDS TO BE BASED ON STATE RESOURCES THAT WE AND OTHERS MANAGE INCLUDING KHALLID OUT AND CALIFORNIA ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDE -- AT OPR WE ALSO PRODUCE THE FIRE HAZARD TECHNICAL ADVISORY TO HELP COMMUNITIES -- AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THINK YOU'RE WILD FIRE MITIGATION AND PREPAREDNESS SO. ALL OF THOSE PIECES IN COMBINATION WITH EVERYTHING YOU HEARD HERE ARE REALLY THE SHORT TERM WHAT COMMUNITIES DO WITH THEIR EXISTING STRUCTURES WITH THEIR EXISTING PLANS. UP TO BETTER PROTECT THEMSELVES AND TO REDUCE RISK BUT THERE'S ALSO A LONGER TERM PART OF THIS CONVERSATION WHICH IS THE HOW DO WE START TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. WHEN WE KNOW AND MY COLLEAGUE AND TERRIBLE TALK MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS BUT WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXACERBATING ALL THESE IMPACTS? OF THAT WET SEASONS COMBINED AND DRY SEASONS AS YOU KNOW CREATE MORE VEGETATION WHICH THEN DRIES OUT WHICH CREATES A SITUATION. THAT'S RIGHT FOR MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WILDFIRES THAT IS HAPPENING IN COMBINATION WITH. AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN THE STATE THAT'S MOVING PEOPLE FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT OF SOME OF THE MORE URBAN JOB CENTERS OF THE STATE. I I WAS THAT I IDEA EVENT WITH A NUMBER OF FOLKS FROM PARADISE RECENTLY WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH TWO BEDROOM HOUSES IN PARADISE. THAT'S NOT A NUMBER YOU HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE MOVING FURTHER OUT IN PART TO FIND AFFORDABILITY A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS ARE SENIORS ON MIXED AND ON FIXED INCOMES. WE KNOW FROM ALL THE DATA AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE FATALITIES IN THESE FIRES WE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE OVER. SIXTY FIVE ON ZERO SORT OF GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED SOCIALLY ISOLATED FOLKS HAVING LESS MOBILITY HARDER TO GET OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND A LOT OF THAT IS EXACT NOT ALL BUT SOME OF IT IS EXACERBATED BY THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. SO ALTERNATELY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT THESE RISKS WHEN DOING LONG TERM PLANNING. WE NOW ON THE HOUSING SIDE WHICH WERE ALSO VERY INVOLVED IN THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PLAN FOR THEIR HOUSING NEEDS WERE HAVING A VERY ACTIVE STATE CONVERSATION AND OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS. HAVING AN ACTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THOSE PROJECTIONS LOOK LIKE AND WHAT ARE HOUSING NEEDS ARE. UNFORTUNATELY SHORTFALLS IN OUR HOUSING HIS COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS THIS URGENCY IN THIS EMERGENCY AFFORDABILITY SITUATION THERE IS AN EXTREME SHORTAGE OF HOUSING IN THE STATE AS YOU KNOW EVERYONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS HAS THIS PROBLEM. YOU POINTED OUT -- REQUIRING CALIFORNIANS TO SPEND AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF MONEY ON HOUSING BUT ALSO AN INCREASING AMOUNT ON TRANSPORTATION. SO IT'S SORT OF EXACERBATING ALL THESE ISSUES AND THEN ULTIMATELY PUSHING FOLKS -- IN SOME CASES INTO THESE WE WE AREAS THESE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREAS. WE CANNOT USE THE HOUSING CRISIS AS A REASON TO EXPAND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OVER THE LONG TERM INTO AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE THAT ARE. EXTREMELY HIGH RISK. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE ACROSS ALL THESE AREAS WHETHER IT'S RISK AND LIABILITY TO THE STATE AND INDIVIDUALS. BOB ALSO WHETHER IT'S RISK TO UNDERMINING THE VERY CLIMATE GOALS THAT CALIFORNIA LEADS ON THAT ARE WE HOPE. GOING TO EVENTUALLY MINIMIZE OUR FIRE RISK IF WE CAN BRING EMISSIONS DOWN. WE'RE THE AREA IN WHICH WE ARE INCREASING EMISSIONS MOST EVERY DAY IN THE STATE IS IN TRANSPORTATION AND LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES PEOPLE TRAVELING. FARTHER AND FARTHER TO GET FROM HOME TO WORK TO GET FROM HOME TO SCHOOL THESE ARE INTER RELATED ISSUES AND WE CAN'T RISK OUR CLIMATE GOALS. BY NOT ADDRESSING THIS LARGER CRISIS OF HOUSING AND LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT. SO ALL OF THESE KIND OF ISSUES CAN TO GOD CAME TOGETHER IN -- THE REPORT THAT RECENTLY CAME OUT FROM THE WILD FIRE STRIKE FORCE OF THE ENERGY STRIKE FORCE TEAM OF THE GOVERNOR WHICH BOTH CHIEF PORTER. AND I WERE PART OF ANY IN THAT REPORT -- ONE SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ACTUALLY ON LAND USE THE REPORT DID SURFACE SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND MAKE THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS -- FIRST OF THAT STATE AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN PLAINER SHOULD INCORPORATE CAL FIRES RISK PROJECTIONS AS WELL AS FIRE PROJECTIONS IN CLIMATE PROJECTIONS FROM THE ADAPTATION CLEARING HOUSE AND FOR CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. INTO SHORT AND LONG TERM PLANNING THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN'T THINK OF THIS AS A LUXURY. OR A SIDE ISSUE TO INCORPORATE THESE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY CRITICAL IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE REST TO DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS IN COMMUNITIES. BOB WE I IN THAT REPORT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE MADE THE CASE THAT WE SHOULD BE. DE PRIORITIZE A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN VERY HIGH RISK EXTREME VIRUS CARRIES OF THE STATE. AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS DOING AND MANY OF YOU LEGISLATURE DOING. PRIORITIZING I'M DEVELOPMENT AND I EXISTING URBAN AREAS THAT ARE LOWER. IN ORDER TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE THE HOUSING CRISIS WITHOUT PUTTING. MORE AND MORE PRESSURE ON THESE HIGH RISK SOUNDS. WE ALSO -- OR THE REPORT ALSO DIRECTED MY OFFICE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH TO PRIORITIZE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HIGH FIRE RISK AND YOU IN TURN I THINK WE'LL TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING THAT WE'RE DOING A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK IN THOSE COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW. ON THE GROUND. I'M MANY OF THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE RURAL AND UNDER RESOURCE TO AND LACKING IN THE KIND OF PLANNING CAPACITY THAT SOME OF THE MORE URBAN AREAS OF THE STATE HOUSE. AND SO THERE'S A BIT WE FEEL IN OUR OFFICE THAT WE'VE A PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY. TO REACH OUT TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THOSE AREAS. ULTIMATELY WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH THESE FIRES -- WHICH OF A FACT EVERYONE'S ABILITY TO LIVE AND THRIVE IN THE STATE. WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVELY THINKING ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE THESE RISKS AND JUST TO MY COLLEAGUES POINT A PARTICULAR DIRECTOR GIL REACHES POINT. WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THAT NOT JUST IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF FIRES FIRES ARE TODAY'S ISSUE TO MARS ISSUE WILL BE FLOODING AND THEN THE NEXT ISSUE WILL BE EXTREME HEAT AND PASS AND THEN THE NEXT ISSUE WILL BE. SEA LEVEL RISE IMPACTS ON OUR WATER SUPPLY AND THEY'RE KIND OF CALIFORNIA IS A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL STATE WITH THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY OF HAVING EVERY CLIMATE IMPACT THAT EXIST EXIST SOMEWHERE IN IT. SO WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS THROUGHOUT OUR LONG TERM PLANNING AND AND GROWTH CONVERSATIONS AND IT REALLY IS A MOMENT I THINK THIS. GIVES US A MOMENT TO REALLY TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK STRATEGICALLY ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS. AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND HOW WE CAN REALLY PLAN. MORE -- MORE ADEQUATELY FOR THE FUTURE IN A WAY THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T THAT PUT OUR OUR PEOPLE AND OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK. I'M TO TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE RETARDED TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT BOTH THE CLIMATE IMPACT SIDE OF THIS ISSUE AND THE COMMUNITY SIDE THANK YOU. WELCOME. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES -- FOR INVITING ME HERE TO JOIN THIS PANEL TODAY I'M NEW IN TARA KEY I AM ARE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROGRAM DIRECTOR IN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. I ALSO CHAIR OUR ADAPTATION TECHNICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL AS WELL WHICH I'LL DESCRIBE HERE IN A MINUTE. A BUILDING OFF OF MUCH OF WHAT THE REST OF THE PANEL HERE AND AND DIRECTOR GORDON HAS -- LAID OUT I'M GONNA BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT HOW WE WORK TO SUPPORT LOCAL ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE EFFORTS THROUGH THE INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROGRAM OR R. ADAPTATION PROGRAM AND PR. I CARP IS THE ACRONYM SO IF I USE THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS OUR ADAPTATION PROGRAM -- SO SENATE BILL TWO FORTY SIX ESTABLISHED I CARP IN OUR OFFICE AND THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS PER THE ENABLING LEGISLATION. THE CREATION OF A TECHNICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL WHICH I'LL DESCRIBE IN A MINUTE AS WELL AS OUR ADAPTATION CLEARING HOUSE WHICH ALSO DESCRIBE. BUT OUR CHARGE PER THE ENABLING LEGISLATION IS REALLY TO WORK TO BETTER ONLINE STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS ON ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE BUT REALLY WITH AN EYE TOWARD SUPPORTING LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION. SO GIVEN THE POINTS THAT DIRECTOR GORDAN LAID OUT IN OUR ROLE IN -- PR WE REALLY HAVE THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY AT OPR TO HELP WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- PARTNERS AROUND THE STATE AND TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT OF THEIR NEEDS AND AND WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO GET WORK IMPLEMENTED ON THE GROUNDS THAT BUILDS OUR RESILIENCE. SO WE TAKE A BROAD VIEW AS IN MANY OF THE MY COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE ALSO MENTIONED IN TERMS OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT RESILIENCE AND WE THINK ABOUT RESILIENCE IN. THE TERMS OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER THAT'S HOUSING OR ROADWAYS OR YOU KNOW OTHER BUILD ASSETS BUT WE'RE ALSO THINKING ABOUT RESILIENCE AND HOW WE'RE MANAGING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND NATURAL ASSETS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEN EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES AND MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITIES. ALL MEMBERS OF COMMUNITIES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO AND THRIVE IN SPITE OF THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SO GOING BACK TO OUR PROGRAM QUICKLY JUST TO GIVE A HIGHLIGHT ON THOSE TWO COMPONENTS OF OUR WORK -- WE HAVE THE ADAPTATION CLEARING HOUSE WHICH IS REALLY INTENDED TO SERVE OF A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE AROUND THE STATE AND REALLY TRYING TO HELP SUPPORT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL PRACTITIONERS BUILD THEIR CAPACITY IN BRINGING CLIMB IT INTO THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING ON THE LONG RANGE PLANNING INTO ALSO AND ALSO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFORTS IN THE NEAR TERM. SO WE YOU SEE THE CLEARING HOUSE AS OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BRING MANY OF THE RESOURCES THAT WERE DESCRIBED HERE THAT OUR SISTER AGENCIES DEVELOP AND THOSE TOOLS TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO AXIS. WE DEFINITELY HIGHLIGHTS STATE RESOURCES LIKE CALIDAD UP AS WELL AS THE STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN AND GUIDANCE FROM CALLOW YES AS WELL AS MANY OF THE OTHER RESOURCES YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT HERE. THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM IS OUR TECHNICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL AND THE COUNCIL REALLY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ACROSS STATE AGENCIES WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER CRITICAL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. NON PROFITS AS WELL AS BUSINESS AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL IN THIS SPACE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WATER THE CHALLENGES AND BEAR YEARS THAT COMMUNITIES ON THE GROUND ARE FACING AND HOW DO WE AS STATE AGENCIES AND AS PARTNERS IN THIS HELP TO ALIGN OUR EFFORTS. AND MANY OF THOSE EFFORTS WERE TALKED ABOUT HERE BUT ALL HIGH LIKE A COUPLE OF THOSE THAT WE'VE BEEN IN YOU KNOW IN PARTNERSHIP SPECIFICALLY WITH CALLOW YES FOR EXAMPLE ON A LINING GENERAL PLANTS AND LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS. BUT THE COUNCIL IS A REALLY A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO INFORM THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ITS STATE AGENCIES. SO OUR COUNCIL PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO OPR INTO OUR ADAPTATION PROGRAM ON A BROAD ARRAY OF RESILIENCE TOPICS AS WAS MENTIONED YOU KNOW WILD FIRES ONE OF MANY MANY CLIMATE IMPACTS HERE -- BUT WHAT KEY AREA ESPECIALLY FOR THE OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO HAS BEEN OUR TOPIC HAS BEEN AROUND SB THREE SEVENTY NINE AND HOW LOCALS ARE ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD IN IMPLEMENTING. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR IN THEIR GENERAL PLAN AND TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE IN ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO INCORPORATE CLIMB INTO THEIR GENERAL PLANS. AND THE THE ISSUE OF PRE AND POST WILD FIRE PLANNING HAVE BEEN TWO VERY IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT HAVE COME UP THROUGH THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION WITH OUR COUNCIL AND THE WORK FOR DOING IT -- PR. SO ONE AREA THAT I WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT -- WAS MENTIONED HERE -- BUT EARLIER IS THAT WE'VE DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK TO TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE FACTORS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE DRIVING VULNERABILITY WITHIN COMMUNITIES RECOGNIZING THAT UNDERLYING SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS YOU KNOW ACCESS IN OUR BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND OTHER UNDERLYING CONDITIONS ARE JUST EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE IMPACTS SO WE GO THROUGH OUR COUNCIL HAVE DEVELOPED A DEFINITION FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS GUIDANCE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IN THEIR PLANNING PROCESS SEES ON HOW TO MAKE THAT DEFINITION ACTIONABLE IN THEIR WORK. AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT TO MAKE SURE THAT WORK AND THE INPUT THAT CAME THROUGH THAT PROCESS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WAS REFLECTED IN THAT STATE EFFORT. SO RETURNING BACK TO SB THREE SEVENTY NINE AND THE GENERAL PLAN WE KNOW THATFOR MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THREE SEVENTY NINE AND MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT WILL REALLY BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY ARE INCORPORATING. CLIMATE INTO THEIR COMIC ADAPTATION INTO THEIR GENERAL PLAN. SO WE ARE VERY INTERESTED GIVEN THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY NEW REQUIREMENT IN BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE LOCAL CHALLENGES BARRIERS AND ALSO INNOVATIONS THAT LOCALS ARE TAKING IN BRINGING THIS INFORMATION IN. SO WE ARE EMBARKING ON DOING KIND OF A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND TO ENGAGE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GET THAT INFORMATION. TO HELP INFORM OUR WORK AS WELL AS THAT OF OUR STATE PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE RIGHT TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO ENABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS -- ANECDOTALLY WE'VE HEARD THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF A LOCAL PARTNERS ARE AND YOU KNOW RUNNING INTO STICKING POINTS WITH SOME OF THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS AND PARTICULARLY RUNNING INTO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF HOW TO INCORPORATE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS. INTO PLANNING GIVEN THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY AND ALSO COMPOUNDING ISSUES BETWEEN CLIMATE BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE YOU KNOW AND ALSO -- YOU KNOW CASCADING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE LIKE WILDFIRE AND FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES -- AND HOW THAT HOW DO YOU INCORPORATE THAT INTO YOUR PLANNING EFFORTS. SO ONE OTHER AREA THAT ALL BRIEFLY TOUCH ON IS WE'VE DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL AND STATE PARTNERS TO ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW WE SUPPORT PLAN ALIGNMENT. AND THIS IS WHERE THROUGH A GREAT PARTNERSHIP WITH CALLAWAY YES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY AROUND HOW WE SUPPORT ALIGNMENT BETWEEN GUIDANCE WE'RE GIVING ON THE GENERAL PLANS -- YES IS GIVING ON LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS AND REALLY WORKING TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE THESE LOCAL PLANS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SUPPORTIVE OF BOTH NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM CLIMATE AND PLANNING GOALS -- WE ALSO -- THIS BRINGS ME TO MY AS A SORRY THIS POINT ON PLAN ALIGNMENT ALSO BRINGS ME NOW THE LAST POINT ABOUT OUR WORK THROUGH I CARP WHICH IS. REALLY WORKING TO COORDINATE STATE EFFORTS SO MANY STATE AGENCIES ISSUE A LOT OF GUIDANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS THERE I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN FOCUSING ON IS HOW WE BRING. OUR STATE PARTNERS TOGETHER SO THAT IN WHEN WE'RE ISSUING GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES TO LOCALS WHERE ALIGNED AND SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR NEEDS. SO THE LAST POINT -- BEFORE I CONCLUDE HERE IS THAT I WANT TO JUST MENTION THAT OPR IS WORKING AS PART OF THE STATE RECOVERY SUPPORT FUNCTIONS AND RECOVERY EFFORTS IN BUTTE AND PARADISE. AND WE ARE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH CALLAWAY YES AND MANY OF OUR OTHER STATE PARTNERS. TO REALLY PROVIDE THE RECOVERY SUPPORT NEEDS FOR COMMUNITIES -- FRONT THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE CAMPFIRE AND IN REAL TIME WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES HOW WE HAVE NEAR TERM RECOVERY EFFORTS AND PROJECTS. HELP SUPPORT LONG TERM RESILIENCE AND AND COMMUNITY PLANNING EFFORTS -- SO YOU KNOW WE THINK WE'RE ALL WORKING HERE TOGETHER AS OUR STATE PARTNERS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE REALLY SUPPORT LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION AND BUILDING RESILIENCE ACROSS THAT WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONAL PARTNERS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- YOUR INFORMATIONS OVERWHELMING AND I MUST ADMIT A LITTLE BIT OF DEPRESSING. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS WE'RE GONNA GO MY GOSH AGO THE RUPIAH HEAD OF US -- I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS FOR LETTING ME CRASH ON THE HEARING TODAY --I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE AND GIVING US SUCH COMPREHENSIVE -- PRESENTATIONS I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE VERY WELL SERVED BY ALL OF YOU AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL TAKE SOME COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT WE HAVE -- EXPERTS LIKE YOURSELF DEVOTING ALL OF YOUR TIME TO I TRYING TO KEEP US SAFE AND MAKE A SAFER SO THANK YOU -- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS MY FIRST IS -- YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER BEEN TO JAPAN BUT I'M TOLD THAT THEY HAVE EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC TRAINING ABOUT EMERGENCY PREPARATION AND HAVE EXTREMELY ORGANIZED. BLOCK CAPTAINS AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO AN EMERGENCY KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH KINDERGARTEN KIDS BUT YOU KNOW FOR ADULTS AND FOR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE OUR SEARCH PROGRAM WHICH SOME PEOPLE DO AND WHICH IS GREAT BUT TENDS TO BE KIND OF FUNDED THE NOT FUNDED AN ACTIVE NOT ACTIVE IN ITS VOLUNTARY AND YOU MAY HAVE ONE PERSON ONE AREA THAT'S DONE IT BUT THE REST OF PEOPLE ON THE BLOCK DON'T. EVEN KNOW SO IS A TIME FOR US TO THINK ABOUT IN SOME AREAS A MORE. COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE PROGRAM THAT IS NOT VOLUNTARY FOR PEOPLE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE DRILLS AND HAVE TO LEARN WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY AND WHAT THEIR ROLE IS AND WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S ROLE. I PROBABLY FALLS WITH ME ON THAT -- ONE SO I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED UP QUITE A BIT IN JAPAN AND AND AND WORK WITH THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT -- AND WE'VE GOT PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE JAPANESE -- EIGHT FIRST OF ALL -- THEY THEY DO HAVE -- A VERY EXTENSIVE. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM -- BUT THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT CULTURE THAN WE DO -- AND AND THEIR THEIR CULTURE IS IS ONE OF OF BATES -- YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT BANKS HAVE TRIED MY BEST WORDS BUT YOU KNOW THEY IT'S A COMPLIANCE. MORE COMPLIANT CULTURE -- THEY START AT A VERY YOUNG AGE PRESCHOOL AND AND AND START START TRAINING. ALL ON THE FACT PREDOMINANTLY EARTHQUAKE RELATED BECAUSE THEY HAVE HUGE EARTHQUAKES IN JAPAN AND SO -- EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS IS ONE OF THEIR HUGE -- FOCUS POINTS -- THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OTHER KINDS DESPERATE TSUNAMI IS ANOTHER ONE THAT THEY FOCUS IN ON AND THEIR THEIR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. DOES -- FIND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OF EFFORT TO PROVIDE TRAININGS AND IT BECOMES A THEIR CULTURE A SENSE OF COMMUNITY PRIDE. TO BE ABLE TO BUILD BLOCK. CAPTAINS IN BLOCK TEAMS -- AND THEY ACTUALLY ACT WE ACTUALLY HAVE -- COMPETITIONS. THAT MOVE FORWARD -- HERE CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW -- I I THINK THAT -- ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS THAT WE CAN -- ENCOURAGE IS BUILDING A CULTURE PREPAREDNESS -- WE DO. IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY -- AND NOT AS A COMPLETE A COMPLIANT -- AS THE JAPANESE ARE BUT YOU LOOK AT FIRE SAFETY AND AND YOU KNOW NOW CAN ACTIVE SHOOTER AND OTHER KINDS OF THINK EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS DOC -- DROP COVER AND HOLD SCHOOL KIDS START TO DO THAT THEY THEY LEARNED THAT THROUGH THEIR WHOLE LIVES IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EARTHQUAKE RISK -- WILDFIRE DROP -- AND ROLL THAT'S RIGHT. I MAKE SURE I GOT IT STOP DROP AND ROLL -- I I I I THINK THERE'S A BENEFIT THOUGH FOR US TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT OF ADS. ONCE YOU BUILD THAT INTO THE YOUTH AND IT STARTS TO COME FORWARD AND IF IT GETS REINFORCED OVER AND ALL AND THEN IT'S PRACTICED. AS THEY GET OLDER -- IN BUSINESSES EXCEPT -- FOR AND I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE PROBABLY HAD THE BEST COMPLIANCE FOR THIS IN THE AREA OF EARTHQUAKE AS WELL SO WE HAVE THAT. THE THE THE THE SHAKE OUT EVERY YEAR -- WE'VE GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN THAT -- SCHOOLS BUSINESSES EXCEPT. FOR AND AND IN YOU A STRESS AGENTS IN YOUR COMMUNITY REALLY ARE GREAT REPRESENTATION TO GET COMMUNITIES TO FOCUS IN ON DISASTER PREPAREDNESS. OF FUNDING MICE YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN HIT AND MESSES UP AND DOWN DEPENDS ON WHERE WE CAN GET THE FUNDING -- TO BE ABLE TO DO IT -- IT IS I WOULD JUST SAY NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE BOARD BUT YOU KNOW BETWEEN OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS IN WHAT WE GET FROM FOR STATE TAB PROGRAMS AND WHAT LOCALS THEMSELVES PUT INTO IT -- YOU KNOW WE TRY TO GET THE JOB DONE. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT -- WHAT WORKS IN ONE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE TO BE ALTERED? FOR THE CULTURE OF OUR STATE -- AND WE DO OFFER TRAINING IN THERE OR SOMETHING SO PEOPLE KNOW -- BUT I HAVING BEEN THROUGH SOME EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER DISASTERS MYSELF -- A LOT OF PEOPLE KIND OF KNOWING HOW TO DO SOME THINGS BUT THEN FEELING COMPLETELY ON THEIR OWN AND NOT HAVING ANY ORGANIZED STRUCTURE -- AFTER EMERGENCY HITS AND SORT OF WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO RESCUE THEM -- I THINK WE NEED TO I PERSONALLY THINK WE HAVE TO RETHINK THAT STRATEGY -- YOU KNOW I REMEMBERED IN THE IN THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE AND I HAD JUST MOVED OUT. RECENTLY WITH WATCHING PEOPLE DRIVE. LIKE MANIACS UP AND DOWN DEAD END STREETS TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT OF LOS ANGELES AND PEOPLE AND FEELING MYSELF COMPLETELY ISOLATED. AND ALONE AND HAVING NO IDEA. WHAT TO DO IF YOU KNOW SORT OF THINGS HAD GONE ON LONGER IN TERMS OF POWER BEING OUT THAT KIND OF THING SO? I THINK THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR NO MORE ORGANIZATION OF COMMUNITIES -- ON THE GROUND I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT OR WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT I THINK pBUILDING OFF OF I'M NOT TO SWITCH TO HOUSING I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THIS TENSION NOW BETWEEN OUR DESIRE TO BUILD THE HOUSING THAT WE NEED. AND FIGURING OUT WHERE TO BUILD IT AND YOU EVERYBODY LOVES TO TALK ABOUT DOING MORE BUILDING BUT WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO INDIVIDUAL CITIES ENTITLING PROJECTS IN OUR URBAN AREAS WE SEE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF RESISTANCE FROM PEOPLE. I JUST TODAY IN THE LA TIMES THERE WAS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HOW SOME OF WHAT SOMEHOW BUILDING TALLER BUILDINGS IT'S GOING TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM SKATEBOARDING ON SIDEWALKS AND PLAYING BALL IN THE STREET AND JUST YOU YOU HEARD HEARING CRAZY ARGUMENTS AGAINST BUILDING HOUSING SO PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED. FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT. BUT HOW DO WE YOU KNOW DON'T WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TO JUST SORT OF STOP BUILDING IF IT'S GOING TO BE IN AREAS THAT ARE NOT DEFENSIBLE I MEAN IS A COME IS IT JUST THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE. WHATEVER BUILDINGS MUNICIPALITIES WANT TO DO -- AS DEFENSIBLE AS POSSIBLE OR IS THERE A POINT AT WHICH WE SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THESE AREAS ARE JUST GOING TO BE OFF LIMITS TO DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING TO BE TOO DANGEROUS DO YOU HAVE ANY. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. THANK -- NO I THINK IT'S IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT IN AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS ISSUE OF COURSE IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ALREADY LIVE IN THESE AREAS I THINK -- AND AND I YOU ALL CAN CORRECT ME IF THIS IS WRONG BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IT'S ABOUT TWO POINT. FOUR OR SOMETHING MILLION PEOPLE AND IF YOU LOOK AT JUST THE WE WE GENERALLY IT'S LIKE ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE SO IT'S A VERY LARGE POPULATION OF OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S ALREADY IN THESE AREAS. SO WE'RE NOT OBVIOUSLY IN A POSITION I KNOW ONE WOULD SAY THAT WERE IN A POSITION TO SAY. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE RETREATING IN SOMEWHERE RIGHT -- THE QUESTION BECOMES. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DEFENSIBLE AND DEFENSIBLE WITH THE RIGHT KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT YOU ALL HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND AND WITH I THINK MUCH STRONGER? YOU KNOW FRANKLY MUCH STRONGER INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAKING ON SOME OF THE DEFENSE OF SPACE WITH HELP SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES SPACE WHICH IS ALSO. IN OUR OPEN SPACE AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE BUILT IN SO IT'S NOT YES SO THIS IS NOT YOUR LOOK OUT AND FILL IN ALREADY DEVELOPED AREAS RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT AND SO GOING TO THE OTHER PART IS SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH PLACES THAT HAVE NOT. YET BEEN DEVELOPED SLASH -- PLACES THAT ARE -- OR ARE REALLY REALLY HIGH RISK AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY. GOOD QUESTION I MEAN AGAIN THE THE THE GOVERNOR STRIPPERS REPORT I THINK WENT. FURTHER THAN MANY THINGS HAVE GONE IN THE PAST BY EVEN SAYING WE SHOULD DISCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT. IN SOME OF THESE HIGH RISK AREAS -- WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO DISCOURAGE I THINK PART OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IS INCREASE IS ENCOURAGING IT ELSEWHERE? SO ONE THING WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT AT OPR IS BARRIERS TO DEVELOPING THE KIND OF INFILL HOUSING THAT WE ALL TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME AND I THINK THIS STATE I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE STATE IS IN A POSITION TO LOOK AT LOWERING SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS. ON TO THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT SO THAT YOU'RE NOT PUTTING DEVELOPERS IN A POSITION WHERE IT'S JUST CHEAPER AND EASIER. FRANKLY TO BE IN A GREEN FIELD -- OPEN SPACE AREA ONE OTHER THING THAT THAT FEEDS IN AND I DIDN'T SAID EARLIER BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT TO FEES IN THIS CONVERSATION WE KNOW FROM SOME OF THE FIRES THAT IT JUST HAPPENED THAT ACTUALLY AGRICULTURE LAND. WAS A BUFFER -- THAT STOP FIRE FROM SPREADING IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THIS CONVERSATION IS HOW DO WE PROTECT. AGRICULTURE LAND THAT'S A BUFFER IN THESE HIGH RISK SITUATIONS AS WELL AS BEING PART OF THAT THE ECONOMY SO I THINK. IT'S SORT OF WHAT THIS DOES IS OPEN THE DOOR TO KIND OF JUST TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A STEP BACK AND HAVING THIS LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT [inaudible] WHERE IS? WHERE IS DEVELOPMENT MAKE THE MOST SENSE -- AND WHERE DO WE AS A STATE WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE ARE RISKS AND LIABILITIES ARE AS WELL AS RECENT LIABILITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS I DON'T HAVE THE PERFECT ANSWER ON THAT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION. AND I JUST HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME JUST TWO MORE QUICK ONES THANK YOU -- BUT SO WE DON'T PROHIBIT DEVELOPMENT IN THESE AREAS WE SORT OF WE DO LEAVE IT UP TO DISABILITIES AND COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I'VE NEVER SEEN A PROJECT IS APPROVED FROM BECAUSE OF FIRE RESCUE NO NO MATTER HOW REMOTE. IT SEEMED -- EVEN VERY LARGE DEVELOPMENTS WE DECIDED TO TWENTY THOUSAND UNIT DEVELOPMENT APPROVED AND MARK YOU KNOW COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES -- AND WE DO RECOVER. BETTER BUILDING REQUIREMENTS NOW WE HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE A LOT OF OF THE STANDARDS BUT WHAT IS THE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM I MEAN WHO ACTUALLY GOES OUT AND DECIDES WHETHER AND NEW DEVELOPMENT. IS UP TO THOSE STANDARDS AND IF THEY'RE NOT WHAT HAPPENS AND WHO WOULD ENFORCE THAT. FOR FIRED FOR ALL OF OUR FIRE WITH FIRE. WELL. FOR CAL FIRE ALL WE DO IS IS WE PRIDE PROVIDE INFORMATION CONSOLE -- WE DON'T WE DON'T MAKE A RECOMMENDATION WE DON'T DECIDE FOR THEM -- YOU KNOW WE CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH A FIRE HISTORY. WE CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH THE FIRE WEATHER -- WE CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH THE ELEMENTS THAT THAT LEAD TO THE TO THE HAZARD. AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON MITIGATING RISK BUT THE DECISION TO BUILD IS A IS A LOCAL DECISION. IT JUST ADDED THAT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN AND THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY STRONG INTEREST IN CONTINUING WITH LOCAL KIND OF VERY LOCALLY SPECIFIC. APPROACHES TO LONG RANGE PLANNING THAT ARE THAT ARE. RELEVANT TO LOCAL AREAS. I WILL SAY THAT PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN A ROSE IS A REALLY INTERESTING EXAMPLE ALSO CENTER IS OBVIOUSLY. WENT THROUGH A VERY. STRESSFUL AND TRAGIC FIRE SITUATION IN A WHAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF AS A FIRE AREA RIGHT I MEAN THOSE THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WERE NOT FORESTED. COMMUNITY -- BUT WHAT SANTA ROSA HAS DONE AND I THINK IT'S INSTRUCTIVE JUST FROM A LOCAL LEVEL WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN TERMS OF REBUILDING. THEY FIRST OF ALL -- HAVE REALLY REDUCE BARRIERS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS THAT WE SEE IN A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE ON THIS. LOCAL LOCAL ZONING AND PLANNING IS PROBABLY THE LARGEST BARRIER TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY IT SEEK WELL BUT MOST OF THE MOST THE THE DAY EVIDENCE IS NOT BEAR THAT OUT ITS LOCAL ZONING PLANNING. CENTER IS A REDUCED THEIR PERMIT. DAYS FROM BIG FINALLY PERMIT TO A PERMIT -- APPLICATION TO FIVE DAYS. BUT MY QUESTION WAS NOT ABOUT. ROSS IS MY QUESTION WAS IF A LOCAL COMMUNITY IS RIGHT IT IS NOT FIRE FOLLOWING THE FIRE REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. WHO ENFORCES WHO MODULE? OVER WHO WHO'S OVER WHO IS OVERSIGHT OF THAT AND WHO IN FORCES -- WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT IS THE MECHANISM? THE GOVERNING BODY WOULD BE THE ENTITY THAT ENFORCES. TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRE AGENCIES ENFORCING AND IF A COMMUNITY IS NOT HAVING THAT OVERSIGHT. I'M SELF IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY'RE NOT DOING IT DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO DO IT DON'T HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL WE JUST CHOOSE NOT TO IS THERE ANY OTHER OVERSIGHT THAT CAN COME IN. AND SAY YOU ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH EITHER BUILDING A A IN FORCING BUILDING CODES OR DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS. NOT FROM STATE OKAY. GREAT LAST QUESTION I'M SB ONE EIGHTY TWO DIED ON SENATOR JACKSON REQUIRES THAT ALL -- PARCELS WITHIN A DEVELOPMENT ARE SUBJECT TO AN ONGOING AND PERMITTED FEE TAX OR ASSESSMENT. OR SOME SOMETHING SIMILAR TO ENSURE THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE MAINTENANCE A CURSE AND IS FUNDED -- SHOULD DEFENSIBLE SPACE COMPLIANCE -- SHOULD COMMUNITY REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THAT WORK HAPPENS UP FRONT. DO YOU THINK. OR IS IT OKAY FOR TO JUST KIND OF GO ON FOR YOU KNOW -- INDEX BE PUSHED OFF SORT OF INTO THE FUTURE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FUNDING MECHANISM TO THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE. PAID UP FRONT CORD IS OVER THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE OF A COMMUNITY OR DEFENSE YEAH FUNDING RECORD FOR THAT -- RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICALLY -- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT -- AGAIN IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- AND WE DON'T HAVE -- A ROLE IN DIFFERENT AND DEFINING THAT OR HOW THAT WOULD BE -- IMPLEMENTED AHEAD OF DURING AFTER -- AND WHEN WE GET -- TO DEVELOPMENT IN THE S. R. A. ONCE IT IS DEVELOPED THEN -- DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND INDIVIDUAL STRUCTURES -- IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OWNER OF THAT STRUCTURE -- BUT BEYOND THAT THERE IS THERE ISN'T A MECHANISM AND THAT'S WHERE WHERE THE TEETH OF OF OUR COMPLIANCE INSPECTION PROGRAM -- COME IN AND THEY COME INTO THE INDIVIDUAL LANDOWNER IN THAT STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA -- AND THERE ARE AREAS AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE THAT ARE THAT ARE IN LIEU LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREA THEY'RE STILL IN A VERY HIGH -- FIRE SEVERITY ZONE -- AND THEY'RE NOT PART OF OF THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL IN THOSE CASES. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK THIS IS GOING TO BE A A HUGE ISSUE AND WE HAVE MILLIONS OF STRUCTURES AND A HAVE TO BE RETROFITTED AND MILLIONS OF LANDSCAPES. THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT AND I THINK WE YOU HAVE A BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES IN SACRAMENTO THAT ARE YOU KNOW VERY ANXIOUS TO WORK WITH YOU AND ALL THE SOLUTION SO THANKS AGAIN. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OUT FOR SO LET ME ALSO REITERATE MY THANKS TO YOU IN YOUR EXPERTISE AND WOULD LOVE SOME IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE US WITH THE WRITTEN TESTIMONY SO WE CAN -- ABSORB AGAIN ALL THE ACRONYMS AND AND AND FAX YOU PROVIDED TO US SO AS SOON AS WE THINK ABOUT THIS FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES I WANNA TRY TO BREAK IT DOWN. MORE SIMPLY IF WHAT. I'LL JUST THROW OUT TO PRINCIPLES OF I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD DO WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. IT SEEMS THAT WE SHOULD BE -- WE SHOULD BE BUILDING IN CERTAIN AREAS I THINK WE ALL. COULD AGREE WITH THAT AND WE SHOULD BE BUILDING MORE QUICKLY IN AREAS THAT WE CAN AGREE WE SHOULD BE BUILDING. BUT THE CHALLENGES AS MISS FREEMAN I THINK. PUT A GOOD POINT TO WE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN DOING EITHER I LIKE TO JUST EXPLORE BOTH FOR A MOMENT -- I'VE HEARD I THINK MS GORDON TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO DE PRIORITIZE DEVELOPMENTS IN HIGH RISK AREAS I HEARD THE TWO CHIEFS TALK ABOUT -- HAZARD SCORES AND THE AN ANALYSIS THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THIS BUT THE REALLY. ISN'T WE HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION AS A STATE THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER NOT. DEVELOPING -- AND IT THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A ROLE FOR STATE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I DO THINK. I'M GONNA PUT THIS DIFFICULT TOPIC OUT THERE BECAUSE I'D. I'D I'D LIKE YOUR FEEDBACK ON ON HOW WE WE DO THIS -- THERE'S NOT A SINGLE LEGISLATOR WHO WILL NOT SUPPORT THE IDEA OF LOCAL CONTROL -- BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE THERE HAVE TO BE SOME NATURAL IMITATIONS TO LOCAL CONTROL AND INTERESTINGLY. WE ALL BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL WHEN IT COMES TO LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING -- BUT WE HAVE STATEWIDE RULES AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE CALIFORNIA -- CRIMINAL LAW WE HAVE STATE WHAT RULES AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH AROUND PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR POPULATION. AND THE TOPIC WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY INTERSECTS THOSE TWO THINGS AND SO. AGAIN I I GUESS I WOULD POSE THE QUESTION A LITTLE MORE INTENSELY THAN MS FREEMAN TO YOU. DO YOU THINK THERE ARE. PARTS OF THE STATE OR COMMUNITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN RAVAGED BY WILDFIRES. THAT WE REALLY SHOULDN'T DEVELOPMENT AND IF THAT'S THE CASE IN AT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT UNDERSTANDABLY WANT TO REBUILD WHERE THEY LIVED BEFORE WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND SAME WITH WE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY. I KNOW IT'S A HARD QUESTION BUT THIS THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT I THINK WE NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH HERE. GO AHEAD I MEAN. YEAH I I THINK YOU'RE KIND OF TOUCHING ON A LOT OF OUR AREAS AYE YOU KNOW IT IT IS -- LOOK. WE COULD BE HAVING THIS SAME CONVERSATION ABOUT. THE EAST BAY. HEY WOULD FALL RUNS RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE EAST BAY. EVERY MAJOR HOSPITAL EVERY MAN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ACCEPT ALL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE ON THE EARTHQUAKE FAULT. THAT'S A BAD THING IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S A GOOD COULD PRODUCE OF A SEVEN POINT EIGHT EARTHQUAKE YET WE BUILD AND LIVE. ON THIS FALL. OKAY THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO. KNOWING THAT WE'VE GOT SOME LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF RISK OF SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF RISK THE NEXT STEP IS. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU BUILD YOU BUILD? TO MAKE MORE RESILIENCY YOU INCREASED. BUILDING CODES. YOU YOU YOU MAKE MORE RESILIENT STRUCTURES IN THE CASE OF EARTHQUAKE THAT'S RETROFITTING ITS BUILDING TO HIRE BUILDING CODES. IN THE CASE A WHILE I FIRE TO CHIEF REPRISE POINT IT'S IT'S IT'S LOOKING OUT OUR EXISTING CODES. AND INCREASING THE COACH TO TRY TO MAKE. HOMES THAT ARE GOING TO BE BUILT IN THE WE WE MORE RESILIENT BUT IT'S ALSO LOOKING AT THE FIRE CORRIDOR AREA AND DETERMINE YOU MAYBE NOT EVERY PART OF THAT COMMUNITY. IS BUILDABLE MAYBE SOME OF IT HAS TO HAVE GREEN SPACE IN IT TO BUILD THESE FIRE BUFFERS THE QUE TALKED ABOUT. SO SO SO THAT SO THAT THERE'S THE ABILITY -- TO SLOWER DEFERRED FIRE SHOULD HAPPEN RIGHT THAT HAS TO BE BUILT INTO ALSO. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT A DEFENSIBLE SPACE PLANNING. SO IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE CHIEF'S QUARTERS. POINT NOT A SILVER BULLET IT'S A COMPENDIUM OF OF EFFORTS -- BUT WE NEED TO GET OVER THAT HURDLE FIRST. BIT THAT SAYS. BOOK. I JUST THINK THE TAX BASE AND I NEED TO BUILD. AND YOUR REGARDLESS OF THOSE RISKS. WAR. WE'RE GONNA PROVE DEVELOPMENT AND WE'LL WORRY ABOUT THE RISK LATER. OR TEN INSURANCE PROBLEM OR THE FEDERAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT WILL COME IN THE DISASTER RECOVERY. WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO IS TAKE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF SAFETY AND SECURITY AND PUT IT ON THE FRONT END OF OUR? GENERAL PLANNING FOR COMMUNITY AND BASED UPON THAT ASSESSMENT THEN BUILD YOUR MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR WITH YOUR BILL THAT MATCHES MY POINT CAN'T BE THAT. HARD. YEAH A AGAIN TOM BORDER -- CAL FIRE I I I I I AGREE WITH -- DIRECTOR GIL DO CHEESE -- COMMENTS A IT REALLY IS -- CALIFORNIA AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING -- ALL AFTERNOON IS A DISASTER PRONE -- LANDSCAPE IN THERE ARE VERY FEW AREAS OF THE STATE THAT YOU COULD SAY ARE TRULY NOT. IN PERIL BY SOME NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSED DISASTERS. AND SO -- WELL THAT -- KIND OF FIT IS A BIT OF A DEFEATIST -- STATEMENT -- WE DO NEED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO BUY DOWN THE RISK AND SO -- WELL WE DO HAVE TWO MILLION PLUS -- HOMES IN VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONE MAP AREAS ALREADY -- AND THERE ARE LOCAL A LAND USE PLANS THAT HAVE PLANS TO DEVELOP MORE IN THOSE SAME AREAS -- PART OF THE EQUATION HERE IS REALLY THAT. ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH AND BUYING DOWN THE RISK BY DOING FUELS MANAGEMENT THAT IS. DISTANT TWO ADJACENT TO AND WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS HARDENING THE STRUCTURES OR ENSURING THAT FUTURE STRUCTURES ARE HARDENED TO THE POINT WHERE. THEY CAN -- THE COMMUNITY CAN BE RESILIENT THROUGH THE NEXT FIRE THAT COMES WHEN TALKING ABOUT FIRES OF COURSE WE HAVE -- MULTIPLE TYPES OF OF RISKS THAT ARE KIND OF OVERLAPPING WHETHER IT'S EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE EARTHQUAKE FIRE FLOOD -- SETO WAS A WAS A COMMUNITY THAT WAS REALLY HIT HARD BY FLOODS THAT. THAT WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE SEEN COMING BUT THEY ALSO WERE MUCH MORE EXTREME THAN WE EXPECTED EVER TO SEE. SO IT ALL OF THESE THINGS I I BELIEVE -- MEMBER CHIU THIS IS THIS IS AYE AYE AYE UP APPLAUD THIS DIFFICULT DECISION A DECISION COVER CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING BUT IT REALLY IS. THERE THERE'S WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM A VERY HOLISTIC APPROACH. JUST BRIEFLY TO ADD TO BOTH MY COLLEAGUES VERY GOOD COMMENTS ON THIS I I WOULD SAY THAT -- ONE OF THE CLASSIC TENSIONS THAT WE HAVE WHICH YOU BOTH REFER TO IS THIS SORT OF ECONOMIC TENSION PEOPLE WANT TO BUILD IN ORDER TO GET THEY THEY THE TAX BASE. BOB AND IT'S HARD TO LOOK OUT FOR IF YOU'RE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL ESPECIALLY WHO IS ON A SHORTER TIME HORIZON. ONE THING THAT I DO THINK THOUGH IS REALLY BECOMING MORE CLEAR AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS PAST FEW MONTHS HAVE MADE IT MORE CLEAR. IS THAT CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE NOT A FAR OFF THING ANYMORE THE AND THAT NOT ONLY THAT. BUT THEY ARE HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE ECONOMICS OF THESE DECISIONS SO THE FACT THAT OUR MAJOR UTILITIES WERE DOWNGRADED. RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED IN PART BECAUSE OF AN ABILITY TO REACT TO SOME OF THE INCREASED FIRE RISK IN STATE. IS AN IMPORTANT TOUCHSTONE BECAUSE IT IT IT IT IS AN EXAMPLE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE OF RAIDER BOND RATERS INSURERS ISSUERS STARTING TO ACTUALLY INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE RISKS INTO THEIR DECISION MAKING IN AND FINANCES. WE ARE A FEW YEARS AGO STATE FARM ACTUALLY SUED THE CITY OF CHICAGO FOR NOT BEING APPROPRIATELY RESPONSIVE TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING. MANY PEOPLE EXPECT MORE OF THOSE TYPES OF LAWSUITS GOING FORWARD AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. CLIMATE RISKS ARE DIFFERENT THAN EARTHQUAKES IN THAT THEY ARE MUCH MORE PREDICTABLE. SO THE THE WORLD OF INVESTORS LONG TERM INVESTORS IS ACTUALLY STARTING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT PREDICT RISK. I THINK WE WILL SEE MORE ECONOMIC IMPACTS FROM THOSE PREDICTIONS IN THESE PROJECTS THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION OF WHAT THE STATE SHOULD BE DOING. BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT I THINK WHERE SOME OF THESE DECISIONS ARE GONNA START BEING MADE POTENTIALLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE DO FEEL LIKE OUR ROLE AT THE STATE IS TO MAKE THOSE DATA AS AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT WHEN COMMUNITIES ARE LOOKING AT THE PREDICTIVE REST WE CAN GIVE THEM AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO SAY. THIS IS WHERE WE SEE A HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD BECOMING A TEN YEAR FLOOD THIS IS WHERE WE SEE SEVERITY AND AND AND FREQUENCY INCREASING. AT SORT OF STAGGERING RATES THIS IS WHERE WE SEE THE IMPACTS HITTING SOONER AND THEN LATER WE DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY WE THINK TO PROVIDE THAT. BECAUSE THAT FEEDS INTO THESE DECISIONS. APPRECIATE THAT. I HAD A NUMBER OF OTHER QUESTIONS BUT IN RESPECT TO OTHER COLLEAGUES LET ME JUST MAKE TWO COMMENTS SO ON THE ONE HAND -- IT IT'S MY PERSPECTIVE WE'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE WE DON'T BUILD BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE. OF WE ARE CLEARLY NOT DOING A GOOD JOB OF BUILDING WHERE THERE IS LESS RISK -- TO CHECK POOREST POINT ASSUMING EVERY AREA HAS SOME REST I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE MANY PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE LESS RISKY FOR US TO DO AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT AS I'M. LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONIES YOU LATER ON ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ANALYSES AND HAZARD MITIGATION FEES AND SEQUEL AND AND IT ADDS TIME. AND AND MONEY TO ACTUALLY BUILDING HOUSING SO SO I THINK THE IRONY HERE IS -- THERE'S A NATURAL DESIRES FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN RAVAGED AND DESTROYED TO REBUILD THEMSELVES AND THEIR ISSUES WITH THAT. AND THEN BECAUSE OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE CHALLENGES WERE LAYERING ON AND ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY MAKING IT SLOWER TO BUILD WHERE WE SHOULD. AND THAT'S JUST A COMMENT AND AND I WOULD SAY COLLEAGUES I HOPE WE CAN ENGAGE IN THIS AND THINK OF WHAT CAN WE DO TO SPEED UP PRODUCTION WE ARE IT IS LESS RISK IN THE LAST THING I WANT TO JUST. ASK FOR SUGGEST IS I KNOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME HIS PROPOSED. NEW PLENTY DOLLARS THIS YEAR UP WHEN IT COMES TO THINK ABOUT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BUT IT'S OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS PLANE DOLLARS ARE REALLY FOCUSED AS MUCH AS THEY COULD BE ON COMMUNITIES. LIKE THE ONES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT REALLY NEED TO DO AN AWFUL LOT OF PLANNING TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND AND I WOULD SUPPORT THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP. THOSE COMMUNITIES DO THIS PLANNING FASTER SO THEY CAN TAKE THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE AND TAKE THE BEST THINKING THAT WE GOT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO EITHER REBUILD OR NOT. AND THEN TO MAKE SURE OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE BUILDING EVEN FASTER TO DEAL WITH THE THE THE THE THE THE STRIKE THAT THE CRISIS. AND STRESS SO. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION TO LOOK FOR TO OTHERS -- WITH -- WITH HER COLLEAGUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU US A MEMORABLE FELL. MADAM CHAIR IN MY COLLEAGUES -- I HAVE DEFINITION QUESTION AND DIRECTION HERE POSSIBLE DIRECTION THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE MAY POSSIBLY TAKE. SO FOR DEFINITION -- JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE -- TAKE JUST A FEW SECONDS. INSURANCE SERVICE. OFFICE. STARTED SEVENTY YEARS AGO BASICALLY AS AN INSURANCE PAPERWORK FACTORY OKAY. NOW THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES THE I. S. O. INSURED SERVICE OFFICE. DOES FIRE -- ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS. SO THE FIRE ASSESSMENT DISTRICT FOR INSURANCE PREMIUM PURPOSES GOES FROM. AYE SO ONE THROUGH I. S. O. TEN NOW -- WITH THAT ESTABLISHED I WOULD LIKE TO ASK CAL FIRE. HOW MANY I SO NINE AND I. S. O.? TEN DISTRICTS ARE THERE IN CALIFORNIA. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER I WOULD SPECULATE THAT MANY OF THE RURAL VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENTS. ARE PROBABLY IN THOSE CATEGORIES IN THE CLASS ONES ARE PROBABLY MORE THAN LARGER METRO DEPARTMENTS OKAY NOW THESE ARE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS OKAY. I'M. I'M NOT GOING DOWN THE PLACE YOU'RE NOT GONNA OF LIKE TO GO TO RIGHT. SO THE REASON I SET THAT UP FOR I SO NINE AND I ALSO TEN IS. I ALSO TEN AND NINE IS VERY HIGH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND MANY TIMES THE HOMEOWNERS IN THOSE AREAS THAT WE REALLY DON'T WANT THEM TO BUILD AND BUT THERE THERE. OKAY MANY TIMES THEY DO NOT BUY INSURANCE BECAUSE EITHER IT'S NOT OFFERED ON THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKETS. FOR THE CALIFORNIA HAS THE FAIR PLAN. WHICH MEANS IF YOU CAN'T GET INSURANCE YOU BUY IT FROM THE FAIR PLAN. WELL THE FAIR PLAN HOUSE DID NOT GO BROKE SO THOSE PREMIUMS ARE VERY HIGH. NOW. WHERE THAT BREEZES IS? YOU ALL HAVE A DATABASE. YOU KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN AYE SO AREAS OF DEVASTATING FIRES GOING TO BLOW THROUGH THERE EVERY TWENTY TWO YEARS I'M JUST MAKING THAT UP FOR ILLUSTRATION. BUT YOU KNOW I SO KNOWS SO THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO GET. THE I SO. IS FOR NINE AND TEN WE NEED TO GET THE DATABASE FOR YOU ALL. COMPARE OKAY HERE'S WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS AND YOU'LL LIKE WHERE I'M GOING TO WRITE SO. ACCORDING -- TO ONE OF MY BILLS YOU CANNOT PRECLUDE AND CAN COOLEY WILL. EITHER CONFIRM IZZARD DENY IT BECAUSE HE IS OF SMART ATTORNEY. YOU CANNOT PRECLUDE ANYONE FROM SUING. SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE THAT'S MACRO IN CALIFORNIA IS. THESE FIRES BLOW THROUGH AND NOW EVERYONE SUES PGN THE S. D. G. IN THE EDISON WHATEVER. FOR A GAZILLION DOLLARS AND I JUST MADE THAT NUMBER UP -- WHICH MEANS THAT BY DEFAULT THE ELECTRIC COMPANIES OR WHOEVER ELSE CAN BE A DEEP POCKET IS THE INSURER FOR PEOPLE THAT REFUSE TO GET THE INSURANCE. SO. ONE OF MY POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS TO GO IN. IS. YOU CANNOT PRECLUDE ANYONE FROM SUING. BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS PRESIDENT SO WE NEED TO RESEARCH THIS IS A COMMITTEE. TO LIMIT HOW MUCH YOU CONSUME FAR IN I SO NINE AND ISO. TEN THAT COULD BE A POSSIBLE WAY OF GOING -- BUT WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THOSE DISTRICTS ARE. AND THE I SO PEOPLE WON'T. RELEASE IT LETS YOU PAY MONEY OR YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT BODY. NOW I DID NOT TRY TO GET THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE I WANTED TO DEFER. TO THIS COMMITTEE AND THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE. SO THAT IS A POSSIBLE WAY OF GOING. TO MITIGATE. YOUR PROBLEMS AND THE MACRO PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY. FOR THE ELECTRIC COMPANIES. NOW. IF. YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH MONEY YOU'LL GET PAID FOR A LAWSUIT pWHEN YOU BUILD YOUR GIANT CABIN UP IN THE MOUNTAINS. AND MAYBE GROW SOME TO YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW -- YOU'LL THINK TWICE ABOUT BUILDING THE OR DOING WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING UP IN THE MOUNTAINS ESPECIALLY. IF WE ALSO WITHIN A POSSIBLE BILL IN THE FUTURE PUT IN THAT YOU HAVE THAT WHOEVER IS SELLING THAT PROPERTY HAS TO DO A FULL DISCLOSURE. ON THE FIRE RISK IN HOW MANY HOW OFTEN THE FIRE BLOWS THROUGH THERE. SO YOU CAN DO SOME INTERESTING NEAT THINGS FROM AN INSURANCE VIEWPOINT. AND THAT'S MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONLY KNOWN. THANK YOU I THINK YOU OFFER YOUR PRESENTATION AND I AM WANT TO KIND OF FOLLOW UP AND TRY TO DIG JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER AND WHAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES UPSET -- YOU MENTION MONEY CO I REPRESENT WANT TO CO AND CERTAINLY AND THAT'S BEEN HARD AND A LOT OF EXAMPLES HAVE BEEN GIVEN OF THINGS I THINK THAT BEEN TURNED SANTA BARBARA COUNTY HAVE EXPERIENCE INCLUDING THE AD BUFFER -- FOR THE CITY OF SANTA PAULA AND YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT WANT TO SEE YOU AS AN EXAMPLE AS IT RELATES TO BUILDING HOUSING WE KNOW SYMBOL I KNOW SO MUCH MORE ABOUT A ALLUVIAL FANS NOW. THAN I DID BEFORE BUT I ALSO WITHIN READ THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE BUILDING. ON THE SAME ALLUVIAL FANS THAT BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE. AND SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE. IN ANY THINK MY COLLEAGUES WRITE WERE TRYING TO GET AT THIS TOO BUT WHERE'S THE NEXUS BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE THOUGHTS AND THE FEEDBACK YOU'VE SHARED WITH US WITH HOW IT BECOMES. REAL IN COMMUNITIES IN MODESTY DO THERE WERE AREAS THAT THE COUNTY BOUGHT OUT -- BECAUSE THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD BUT I MEAN I READ IN PAPERS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT BUILDING MAJOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SAME AREA. WE HAVE -- IN NEED -- ADDED DESIRE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING IN THIS STATE BUT I MEAN WHERE IS THE NEXUS BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY AND WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HOUSING -- I THINK IT'S PLAYED ITSELF OUT IN A VERY COMPARABLE COMPLICATED WAY IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT -- AND I KNOW WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER NATURAL DISASTER -- INVENTOR IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WE'VE HAD -- REGRETTABLY MANY BUT I MEAN WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH THIS HOUSING SITUATION AWAY WE HADN'T -- IN ADDITION TO WE HAVE THE HIGH FIRE AREAS -- AND THEN WE HAVE A ONE A ONE AND THAT BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- IS ERODING SO I'M THINKING EVACUATION PLANS I MEAN THIS IS I'M LIKE HOW. ONE NIGHT I HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT EVACUATED SO I'M THINKING HOW DOES THIS ALL COME TO ONE TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE POLICIES WERE ALSO SEEN. ARE REALLY -- I DON'T THINK THEY DIG DEEP IN THIS AREA AND I AND I FIND MYSELF STRUGGLING WHAT DO WE REQUIRE. CITIES COUNTIES -- TO DO THAT CHANGES THE WAY OUR LOCAL COULD THE TOOLS THAT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE AND USED TO MAKE THESE VERY VERY. DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE HOUSING IS BUILT AND WHERE IT IS NOT BUILT. THAT'S A TOUGH -- ONE NO YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGING THINGS ABOUT THIS ISSUE IS THAT AND A AND THE FIRES REALLY UNDERSCORED THAT IS THAT HE DOES BRING ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER WERE USED TO BEING ABLE TO THINK ABOUT. OUR CLIMATE MITIGATION AND WE HAVE SOME OF OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOES OVER HERE AND THEN WE HAVE SOME BRAZILIAN STUFF OVER HERE AND THEN WE HAVE ALL THIS LIKE. EVERY DAY FOCUS ON PLANNING RATE AND AND ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ALL THIS AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE THE SAME THING. AND IT -- AND AND I JUST WANT TO GREW WITH WITH WITH WHOEVER WAS YOU SAID -- ADDING ON MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS NOT A GREAT ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BECAUSE ESPECIALLY IN MANY OF THESE PLACES WERE TALK ABOUT SMALL COMMUNITIES WITH. VERY FEW PLANNING RESOURCES THAT'S ANOTHER THINGTHAT WE HEAR EVERY SINGLE TIME WE GO TO ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONVERSATION AS WE DON'T HAVE ANY CAPACITY TO BE PLANNING -- AND SO. YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT IT -- PR I I THINK IT'S IT'S REFLECTED IN THE WORK SOME BUSTED ON THE STRIKE FORCE IS THE NEED TO START REMAIN STREAMING THIS A LITTLE BIT TO INCORPORATING SOME OF THESE ISSUES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT ALL OF OUR AGENTS HE'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT. INTO THAT MAINSTREAM THINKING AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN ADDING ANOTHER LAYER TO A GENERAL PLAN IT CAN MEAN. YOU DON'T ACTUALLY INCORPORATING THESE ISSUES INTO LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE INTO HOW WE THINK ABOUT HOW BUDGETS ARE CONSTRUCTED HOW WE THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT HOW WE'RE WE'RE GETTING BOND MONEY AND IT WE DO KNOW AND AGAIN JUST GOING BACK TO THE MARKETS WE DO KNOW THAT BOND. ISSUERS AND BOND RATERS ARE PAYING MORE AND MORE ATTENTION TO THIS SET OF ISSUES BECAUSE THE IT IS. GONE FROM A LONG TERM RISK TO AN IMMEDIATE RISK FINANCIALLY. AND SO I THINK WILL WILL BE FORCED I THINK THE LOCAL LEVEL AND STATE LEVEL FRANKLY TO TO BE INCORPORATING THAT MORE INTO THINKING. HOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY PLAY OUT ON THE GROUND THAT'S THE WORRY RIGHT IT'S LIKE THAT DOESN'T HELP US WITH SOMETHING THAT THE PRODUCT PROPOSED TODAY? BUT AT LEAST WE SHOULD I THINK ALL IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO START THINKING ABOUT. HOW TO DO THAT HOW TO HOW TO HOW TO MODEL THAT IS A STATE HONESTLY AND THEN HOW TO THINK ABOUT KIND OF INCORPORATING SOME OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS INTO? INTO LOCAL PLAN IT DOES MAKE ME NERVOUS TO THINK I WILL ADMIT TO THINK ABOUT ADDING ANOTHER LAYER. TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES -- BUT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT LAYER SO MAYBE THERE'S A WAY WE CAN TRY TO GET MORE EFFICIENCY BY BUT ALSO BRING IN THIS. THIS SET OF ISSUES BECAUSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT MEAN ARTWORK CONSTRAINED AS A STATE BECAUSE ALL THIS IS A LOCAL. THIS IS ALL LOCAL CONTROL EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW -- AND WE HAVE. VERY VERY IMPORTANT CLIMATE GOALS AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE VERY IMPORTANT FISCAL GOALS AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE AN OVER ARCHING GOAL THE GOVERNOR'S NUMBER CAN CALL OF OF YOU KNOW INCLUSION AND ADDRESSING INEQUALITIES ARE ALL RELATED. BUT ULTIMATELY THESE PLANNING ISSUES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE. HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- AND AND SO. I THINK AT LEAST TODAY OUR ABILITY TO AS THE STATE TO CAN AFFECT THAT IS FAIRLY LIMITED. ON I THIS IS VERY COMPLEX BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU I I THINK IT STARTS BACK WITH. A CULTURE ISSUE RIGHT WE AS A CULTURE. NEED TO RETHINK THE WAY WE ARE DOING THIS RIGHT. WHEN WHEN I LOOK AT SO LIST TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT THERE ARE COUNTRIES I'VE BEEN TO HOLLAND FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A MASSIVE FLOODING PROBLEM FOR THE LONGEST TIME? WE DID THEIR THEIR WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THE FACT THAT THEY PUT MITIGATION EFFORTS FIRST BEFORE THEY BUILT. THEIR COMMUNITIES UP THEY WERE GETTING REPETITIVE LOS REPETITIVE LOSS RIGHT -- IT WAS HARD BECAUSE IT MOVE BUSINESSES THAT PRECLUDED WITH BUILDING WAS GOING TO GO. BUT BUT THEY DID IT AND NOW THEY HAVE A BASICALLY ZERO AMOUNT OF FLOODING THAT HAPPENS IN THEIR MAJOR MAJOR CAPITAL. I'VE BEEN TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD INDONESIA WHICH HAS TSUNAMIS IN CHINA -- THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WHERE THE CULTURE. DICTATES THE FACT THAT LOOK. MAKE ME FEEL WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT FIRST AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BUILD AROUND THAT IDEA. BEFORE WE JUST GO. BILL FIRST AND THEN BUILD IN A SAFETY AND SECURITY OR JUST DO THE MINIMUM. BUILDING CODE OR TO THE MINIMUM -- THAT'S REQUIRED -- THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHANGE AND ASK HAVE BECAUSE FROM A DISASTER STANDPOINT. THE COST OF THESE FAR OUT TO SEA -- EXCEEDED. AFTERWARDS IN ECONOMIC LOSSES IN LIFE LOSSES IN PROPERTY INFRASTRUCTURE THEN WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING ON THE FRONT END BEFORE YOU REPAIR. SO EGYPT WE JUST NEED TO THINK THROUGH IT DIFFERENTLY AND THE MARKETS WILL PROBABLY END UP. DRIVING IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU MAY NOT GET -- BE ABLE TO GET LOANS OR WHATEVER TO DO THIS BUT WE ALSO AT THE STATE CONTROL THE PURSE TO SOME DEGREE AND WE SHOULD BE. DRIVING SOME REQUIREMENTS I KNOW THIS BY. LOCAL GOVERNING OTHER REALLY MAD AT ME BUT YOU KNOW I THINK WE'D HAVE THAT THE TOP DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. I DON'T THINK WE'RE REALLY DOING IT. RIGHT RIGHT NOW. FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT IS GETTING YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST TOO MANY REST THE REST. AS THE INCREASE IN POPULATION. FOR THE MOST POPULOUS STATE -- COURSE WE GET MORE PEOPLE IMPACTED BECAUSE WE ARE THE MOST POPULOUS STATE -- BUT IT'S NOT JUST HERE VIEW LOOKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN CLIMATE RELATED DISASTER IMPACTS. ARE SEVERE THERE REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND THERE ARE COMMUNITIES GETTING WIPED OUT TIME AND TIME LICENSE LIVES LOST -- WHERE THEY COULD HAVE MITIGATED SOME OF THAT IN IN IN -- NOT BUILDING IN CERTAIN AREAS OR DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS SO I MEAN I THINK THIS IS A WHOLE NOTHER EFFORT JUST TO SIT AND TALK ABOUT THAT BUT IT IS A IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT. THING WILL WE CHANGE OUR THOUGHT PROCESS CAN I CHIME IN ON THAT JUST. MAKE IT VERY QUICK. RELATED TO WILDFIRE SPECIFICALLY -- WE DO HAVE -- A MODEL THAT WE'RE UTILIZING THROUGH OUR LAND USE PLANNING -- GROUP THAT THAT IS WORKING WITH -- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BOTH CITIES AND COUNTIES PARTICULARLY COUNTIES -- TO WHEN THEY OPEN THEIR THEIR SAFETY ELEMENT OF THEIR GENERAL GENERAL PLAN INCORPORATE MANY OF THE CONCEPTS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY PARTICULARLY WHAT. WHAT CHIEF RICH ONE WAS TALKING ABOUT BUT ALSO THE HOUSING ELEMENT WE CAN ALSO GET IN THERE AND AT THAT TIME AS WELL I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO SPREAD THE CULTURAL ELEMENT THAT ANYTHING DIRECTOR GIL GIGI. AND GORDON HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE REALLY NEED TO CHANGE THE MINDSET OF THOSE THAT ARE DOING THE PLANNING AND APPROVING THE PLANS. THAT ARE COMING THROUGH AND MODELS TO LOOK AT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- THAT HAS BEEN VERY -- PROGRESSIVE IS IN SAN DIEGO -- THEY HAVE A VERY LONG TERM -- PLANNING PROCESS THAT HAS HAS REALLY TIGHTENED -- AND ENCOURAGED. THIS INCENTIVIZE THE THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE BACK COUNTRY AND INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CORRIDOR AREAS WHERE THERE'S MORE INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND THERE'S ALSO AN EXAMPLE -- TO PREVIOUS POINT. THAT OF OF DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS BEEN HELD UP FOR YEARS BECAUSE IT CAN'T MEET FIRE SAFETY ELEMENT OF THAT AND IT IS IN THE GROWTH SO SO. WE DO HAVE THESE AREAS THAT ARE KIND OF OUT THERE THAT THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH AND AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT MIGHT HAVE. KIND OF THAT -- STATE -- FLAVOR TO THEM THAT WE'RE LOOKING. FOR THANK YOU RAIN RUN WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT BEHIND BUT WE'RE GOING TO LET ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY SPEAK IF YOU COULD KEEP IT. SHORT WE HAVE -- WE'RE RUNNING BEHIND WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL STILL TO SEE OKAY I WILL TRY TO BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE -- LET OUT I THINK A LOT OF LEGITIMATE CONCERNS BROUGHT UP BY DIFFERENT COLLEAGUES TODAY -- BUT I THINK DIRECTOR GEAR Là DUDE SHE IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND WHAT HE SAME WHICH IS. I THINK IT'S LESS ABOUT WHERE WE SHOULD BUILD OR NOT BUILD. AND MORE ABOUT HOW DO YOU PLAN FOR AND PAY THE COST OF MITIGATING THE RISK THAT EVERY PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. HAS -- INSURANCE CAN ALSO PLAY A ROLE -- AT THE PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE I MEAN IF YOU CAN'T GET INSURANCE [inaudible] DESPITE. YOUR DOING MITIGATION THE MAYBE THAT ISN'T A PLACE. TO BUILD BUT I THINK IF WE TRY TO OVER SIMPLIFY THIS. AND START SAYING WELL HERE'S THE PLACES IN CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD BUILD AND NOT BUILD I THINK WE'RE MISSING A MAJOR POINT THERE -- AND AND A GREAT PLAN MEAN SHOULD WE DO PRIORITIZE PLACE THE I. D. PRIORITIZE PLACES THAT HAVE EARTHQUAKE RISK. AS SHE WE DO PRIORITIZE PLACES THAT HAVE FLOOD RISK -- WE'RE GONNA START RUNNING OUT OF PLACES THAT WE CAN BUILD AND WE KNOW WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS. FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE NEED TO BUILD TO CATCH UP. TO WHERE WE NEED FOR A HOUSING DEMAND. IN THIS STATE -- I WANT TO CONTEXTUALIZE A LITTLE BIT -- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT. NUMBER ONE I MEAN THIS WAS A ONE IN A MILLION FIRE. EVERY FIREFIGHTER THAT I'VE TALKED TO SAID YOU KNOW. WHERE THIS FIRE STARTED IN A VERY REMOTE LOCATION HARD TO GET TO MADE IT HARD TO GET TO THE FIRE EARLY? BUT EVEN WITH THAT FIFTY MILE AN HOUR WINDS WERE BLOWING EXACTLY RIGHT AT COM CAL. AND ULTIMATELY PARADISE IN THIS FIRE JUMPED TO CANYONS. TWO OF A IN A MATTER OF IT IN A MATTER OF HOURS IN THE STARTING SPOT FIRES IN PARADISE BEFORE ANYBODY. WOULD HAVE EVER EXPECTED EVERY FIREFIGHTER SAID THIS QUICKLY BECAME NOT A FIRE FIGHT BUT A LIFESAVING MISSION. IMMEDIATELY IT WAS A NATURAL DISASTER -- AND YOU KNOW MAYBE TO PUT IN AN URBAN CONTENTS AND IMAGINE IF WE DID HAVE. A LARGE SCALE EARTHQUAKE IN SAN FRANCISCO OR THE BAY AREA AND IT WAS LOCAL FIND SOIL IN THERE WAS BUILDINGS FALLING DOWN ALL OVER THE PLACE -- YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO GET OUT AND THERE'S ONLY SO MANY PLACES TO GET OUT AND YOU'RE TRYING TO EVACUATE. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. FROM AN AREA AND YOU ONLY GOT SO MANY BRIDGES IN. THE SAME EXACT THING COULD HAPPEN YOU KNOW. SO LET'S CONTEXTUALIZE A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THE COMMENTS LIKE WELL WE SHOULD ONLY BIRD BUILD IN OUR YOU KNOW MAYBE ALREADY URBANIZED AREAS AND BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE. AND THAT AND EVEN THE THE CONTENTION THAT THAT'S WHERE THE HIGH PERFORMING SCHOOLS ARE -- AND REALLY -- IS WE HAVE HIGH PERFORMING SCHOOLS TO AND WE HAVE ACCESS TO JOBS. IN ON ALL OF THAT -- BUT IMAGINE THOSE URBAN AREAS HAVE SOME SOME HIGH RISK TO UNDER THE RIGHT I THINK JUST FOCUSING ON HEY THIS IS WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THIS IS. IS KIND OF THE WRONG WAY TO LOOK AT IT. UNDERSTAND THIS ABOUT PARADISE. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE MOVE THERE BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO NOT BECAUSE THEY HAD. TO YES THERE WAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING UP THERE AND FOR SOME THAT WAS THE THING. BUT IF YOU KNOW THIS COMMUNITY PEOPLE WANTED TO LIVE THERE. IT WAS WHERE THEY IT HAS A VERY STRONG PLATE SENSE OF PLACE AND COMMUNITY AND IT'S BEEN THERE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS THIS WASN'T A COMMUNITY THAT JUST. YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF GROWTH PATTERNS ALL THE SUDDEN APPEARED. YOU KNOW HERE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IT'S IT'S BEEN THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME -- CLIMB IT MEANS WE HAVE MANY AREAS OF RISK FOR EXAMPLE RISING SEA LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE AFFECTS COASTAL COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE MOSTLY URBAN. COMMUNITIES RIGHT -- AND YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO JUST BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND URBAN PARTS. OF THE STATE. IT WITH THE MARKET FORCES ARE THE HIGH COST. OF THAT THE KOREAN LAND AND ALL THE REGULATIONS AND RULES YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A HUGE TAX SUBSIDY -- TO GET PEOPLE DOWN TO RENTS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND PRICES ARE AFFORDABLE. SO LOOK YOU DO HAVE TO LOOK AT RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. TO MEET OUR AFFORDABILITY AND HOUSING DEMANDS AND UNDERSTAND IS THIS IS WHERE I THINK I PLAY A ROLE. IS THAT I OFTEN DO THIS IS I'M TRYING TO BRING. TO EXPLAIN WHAT RURAL CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY LIFE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEEN THERE AND THAT'S WHY DO SO MANY TOURS. UP INTO MY DISTRICT IN AND ASSEMBLYMAN DOLLY DOES THE SAME THING -- NOT ALL OF RURAL CALIFORNIA IS THE SAME THERE'S A PRETTY BIG DIVERSITY OF GEOGRAPHY. UP THERE AND OUT THERE IN. YOU KNOW IN THE HINTERLANDS IF YOU WILL -- SO FOR EXAMPLE BUTTE COUNTY PARADISE YES IS IN A MOUNTAINOUS WOODED AREA. BUT THERE'S A LARGE PORTION OF BUTTE COUNTY THIS DOWN IN THE VALLEY. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T HAVE FIRE RISK SO CAN KIND OF LOOKING AT BUTTE COUNTY AS THE WHOLE AREA IS A YOU KNOW A LOUIS. IS NOT ACCURATE IT'S WRONG -- AND THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD TRULY AFFORDABLE MARKET RATE HOUSING IMMORAL PARTS OF THE STATE IF WE LOOK AT EXISTING COMMUNITIES SO EXAMPLE IN BUTTE COUNTY WE HAVE. THE CITIES OF CHICO AND BILL BIGGS AND GRIDLEY THEIR EXISTING COMMUNITIES. WHERE LAND ACQUISITION AND OTHER COSTS ARE MUCH CHEAPER WE COULD BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S NOT IN THE HI FIRE HAZARDS -- THESE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO SO JUST. I WANT TO REALLY PUSH BACK AGAINST MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF A BIAS TOWARDS A WE CAN OF WE GOT A STANDARD BEEN AREAS WE CAN'T GO OUT AND RURAL AREAS. THAT'S DANGEROUS. THAT'S NOT TRUE I MEAN IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE CHARACTER IN THE DIVERSITY OF THESE REGIONS -- RURAL DEVELOPMENT -- YOU KNOW CAN BE DONE YOU KNOW AS I SAID AROUND THESE EXISTING COMMUNITIES. THAT REBUILDING IN A PLACE LIKE PARADISE. I THINK CAN BE DONE. YOU KNOW IT'S A MATTER OF MITIGATING THAT RISK AND I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT HIS BILL BETTER AND MORE RESILIENT -- AND GETTING BACK TO PLANNING. THANKS THIS YEAR IN ABOUT A BREWING COMPANY WHO MADE A LARGE DONATION TO THIS THEY HAVE A PLANNER RIGHT NOW IN THE IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE IN A CHURCH THAT STILL STANDING UP THERE -- HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERING AND THEY'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE BUILD SMARTER. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SAFER HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT ROADWAYS CONNECTED DON'T DEAD END -- AND THEY'RE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW THEY TRULY MITIGATE. THE RISK FOR THIS COMMUNITY AND AND AND I THINK IT CAN BE DONE THIS CAN BE A MUCH SAFER RESILIENT. COMMUNITY IN THE LONG TERM THAT SHOULD BE OUR GOAL -- NOT TO SAY OH NO YOU NEVER YOU KNOW -- YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BUILD AND AND AND A PLACE AGAIN -- AND A AND M. AND NOBODY IS IGNORING THAT RISK [inaudible] WHATSOEVER -- IT'S SOMETHING I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY COGNIZANT OF BUT YOU KNOW THE ISSUE SHOULD REALLY BE HEY HOW DO WE REALLY MAKE SURE THAT'S BETTER IN FOR AN AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN BROUGHT UP I THINK WE DO NEED. A MUCH BETTER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. FOR ENSURING THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND YOU CAN BE ENFORCED AND AND THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT DOING IT -- BECAUSE THAT WAS A HUGE ISSUE -- FOR EXAMPLE IN PARADISE. BUILDING HOUSING SO THAT THE EMBERS CAN'T GET UNDERNEATH THE EASE MANY OF THE HOUSES IN PARADISE BURNED DOWN FROM THE INSIDE OUT. BECAUSE EMBERS GOT INSIDE TO THE EAVES. IT WASN'T AND AND IT WAS A VERY QUICK BURNING FIERY IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TAKEN OUT AS MANY HOUSING. AS MUCH HOUSING HAD IT BEEN BUILT TO BETTER STANDARDS -- IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THE COST ACTUALLY FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. TO BUILD A MORE FIRE RESILIENT HOUSE VERSUS THE OLDER STANDARDS THE COST IS VERY NEGLIGIBLE THERE'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE. SO WE CAN DO THAT AND STILL DO IT IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY -- AND THEN IN THE LONG TERM. WE DO HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES ARE FIRE RESILIENT RATE THAT RIGHT NOW TODAY NEED TO BE RETROFITTED. THAT'S WHERE THE EXPENSES IS PRETTY TOUGH TO GET THERE RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HEY HOW CAN WE DO AS IT LOW COST LOANS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. HAS LEGISLATION THAT HE'S WORKING ON RIGHT NOW THE MAYBE CAN ASSIST PEOPLE AND MAKING SURE THEIR HOMES ARE RETROFITTED TO BECOME -- MORE FIRE RESILIENT -- AND THAT WOULD BE A GETS EXPENDITURE OF MONEY THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY THAT WE COULD. NOT IT WOULD BE LITTLE IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT BUT ID BE MONEY. WELL SPENT BECAUSE WHAT'S THE COST OF A DISASTER AND I THINK THAT WAS A GREAT POINT THE CASA DISASTERS. MY IS EXPONENTIAL SO IF WE CAN IF WE CAN DO SOME OF THESE THINGS AND REALLY THINK ABOUT HEY HOW DO WE REALLY. PAY THE COST OF AND MITIGATE RISK -- WE CAN MEET OUR HOUSING GOALS. AND WE CAN  WE CAN SAFER AND MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES LONG TERM -- AND I AND I IN A AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE AGREEMENT NEEDS TO COME AROUND AS IS FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THAT. RATHER THAN GETTING INTO A WILL HATE THIS PLACE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BUILD WE'RE ONLY GOING TO BUILD HERE AND I JUST THINK THAT'S THE WRONG WAY TO CONCEPTUALIZE IT THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU SO REMEMBER GALLAGHER AND OUR FINALS A QUESTION SOME REMEMBER COOLEY. WELL I HAVE MORE COMMENTS I WANT TO SAY ACTUALLY I AGREE WITH MR GALLAGHER'S POINT. I THINK WOULD BE AS SERIOUS FAILURE THE INSTITUTION. TO NOT BE HAVING A STATEWIDE SOLUTION. RURAL VERSUS URBAN. I JUST THINK WE CAN'T SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT WAY. RURAL AREAS YOU TEND TO HAVE LARGER LOT SIZES AND FRANKLY I THINK YOU COULD ROUND REVERT RURAL AREAS. YOU REALIZE. ON OFF A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THOSE LARGER LOT SIZES. THEY'VE TAKEN CARE OF THEIR PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXPECT THAT IF THERE'S A FIRE THAT THE FIRE SERVICE TO GET THERE SOONER UP TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. SO MUCH MORE THAN OUR SERBAN DWELLERS IT'S A MATTER OF SELF PRESERVATION TO TRY TO CREATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IF YOU HAVE. URBAN OR RURAL PROPERTY. I THINK AS YOU MOVE FORWARD I THINK THIS. TIME IS TO IDEAS OF HOW DO WE MEET OUR HOUSING NEEDS HOW TO ADDRESS OUR OUR FIRE RISK OR DISASTER RISK. I ACTUALLY THINK COLLEAGUES WERE SORT OF IN AN ERA OF NEEDING A CALIFORNIA TYPE OF MARSHALL PLAN. WE NEED TO SCALE UP OUR SOLUTIONS TO DO WITH THESE TWO GREAT CHALLENGES. THAT BIND THE FUTURE STATE TOGETHER. IN A CONCERTED WAY. AND AND I JUST WANT TO OFFER THE OBSERVATION THAT WHEN USED AS LAWMAKERS. SAY WHAT THE HECK OF THE TOOLS ARE TOOL KIT. THEY ARE MORE THAN MONEY. THERE ARE MORE THAN PROGRAMMATIC I THINK AS LAWMAKERS. ARE JOB REALLY IS TO ASK HOW DO WE RELEASE ENERGY ON THIS PROBLEM. MONEY MAY BE A WAY A NEW PROGRAM MAY BE AWAY WE KNEW IT REALLY DOES HELP WHAT OTHER DYNAMICS WHERE YOU CAN AFFECT THE CHEMISTRY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. IN PEOPLE'S HEADS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL COURSE I WAS FIRST B. P. OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES SO ALMOST PRESENT LEICA COME TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I SEE MY COLLEAGUES WHY SO SHE WITH THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN THE ROOM. I THINK I WOULD SAY WE OUGHT TO BE GOING TO THE CIVIL CODE WHICH I HAD MY STAFF BRING TO ME. TO JUST SPEND A LITTLE TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM IN LIGHT OF CIVIL CODE PROVISIONS. ELEVEN OH TWO THE TRANSFER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT THAT AROSE IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE TRYING TO PROVE DISCLOSURES ON PROPERTY -- THE NATURAL DISASTER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT ELEVEN OH THREE THE CIVIL CODE. NINETEEN NINETY NINE LOOKING AT FIRE FLOOD. EARTHQUAKE. BECAUSE ACTION WHEN YOU READ THOSE TO JUST THOSE TWO PROVISIONS. YOU'LL START REALIZING OLDER'S MAPS OUT THERE THE PEOPLE OF CREATED TO GET FILED THE LOCAL LEVEL PUT PEOPLE ON NOTICE THEY MAKE INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS ON NOTICE. THAT SENDS A HEIGHTENED LEVEL RESPONSIBLE TO THE SYSTEM. I WOULD SAY. THAT WE MAY NEED OTHER SOLUTIONS BUT HONESTLY I THINK WE WOULD ENLARGE OUR FRAME OF REFERENCE ON THIS CONVERSATION. TO LOOK AT HOW THE TRANSFER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT THE TDS OF LUBBOCK TO AFFECTED. REAL ESTATE IN CALIFORNIA. THE NATURAL HAZARD DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. THE STRUCTURES ARE OUT THERE THE WAY INFORMATION GETS ON MAPS RATED INUNDATION EXPOSURE AND HOW THAT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE THE HOUSING SYSTEM. AND NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO A CONVERSATION WHERE I THINK IT'S MORE OF THE RELEASE OF ENERGY CATEGORY. WHAT CAN YOU DO IN A NEW WANTS WAY THIS STARTS GIVING PEOPLE MORE OF A STAKE IN THE SOLUTION? AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT I DEFINITELY AGREE -- RURAL FOLKS THEY REPRESENT A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF SELF HELP INTEGRAL TO WHAT IS DONE. I DO THINK THE PARADISE FIRE WAS VERY UNIQUE EVENT -- AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE THEREFORE. DON'T TREAT IS A DATA SET WHAT HAPPENED SANTA ROSA AS WAS POINTED OUT VERY UNIQUE EVENT. WE SORT OF NEED TO LOOK AT HOW THESE DIFFERENT FACT THINGS FACTORED SOLUTION. BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS IS A PLACE FOR THE STATE THESE LEADERSHIP I THINK IT NEEDS A MARSHALL PLAN. THE GOVERNOR USE OUT ON AN OPERATION EXPECTED HOMELESS. I THINK I AGREE WITH THATBUT I THINK WE NEED THE SAME SORT OF EMPHASIS ON THE FIRE ISSUE. THAT IS WHERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD ORCHESTRATE SOLUTIONS FOR FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS BUT I THINK IT'S MORE THAN MONEY AND MORE THAN PROGRAMS WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW DO YORKERS AFFECT PEOPLE'S MOTIVATION. THIS RELEASE OF ENERGY CONCEPT WHICH I THINK. AS LAWMAKERS AND PARTNERS A SECOND BRANCH WE CAN WORK ON THAT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW THERE'S PLENTY MORE QUESTIONS ON THIS COMMITTEE BETTER -- BECAUSE OF TIMING -- WE WOULD LIKE -- TO BRING UP FOR SECOND -- PANEL BUT WE WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH I I THINK THEY WERE OVERWHELMED OF HOW WELL THIS WENT TODAY AND HOW MANY QUESTIONS AND IT'S PROMPTED ADDITIONAL -- FOUGHT FOR ALL OF US AND I REALLY -- BUT I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING TODAY -- EXPECT TO GET EMAILS AND OTHER QUESTIONS FROM US IN THE WEEKS TO COME SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT WILL NOW I INVITE OUR SECOND PANEL UP WHILE FILED THE BE THE WILDFIRE PLANNING EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND HOUSING DELIVERY SOME LOCAL PERSPECTIVES. A PEEP PARKINSON OF A. I. C. P. PAST PRESENT AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER FORMER CINEMA COUNTY PLANNING DIRECTOR. DANA CAREY EMERGENCY SERVICES MANAGER FROM THE YELLOW OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. KEITH WOODS CEO NORTH COAST BUILDERS EXCHANGE AND BRIAN RING ASSISTANT CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER FROM BUTTE COUNTY. WE WELCOME YOU ALL. AND ONCE YOU GET -- COMFORTABLE MISTER PARKINSON PLEASE START. I'M READY. FOR YOUR PATIENCE OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS. A GOOD AFTERNOON CO CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES -- YOU SAID MY NAME IS PETE PARKINSON AND I'M HERE TODAY WITH THE PERSPECTIVE BOTH OF A WILDFIRE SURVIVOR. AND OF A PROFESSIONAL PLANNER WITH OVER THREE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN THREE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ALL OF WHICH HAVE. EXPERIENCED DEVASTATING WILDFIRES AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER -- I WAS THE DO PLANNING DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY OF CINEMA UNTIL TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND MY FAMILY LOST OUR HOME IN THE SNOW BUT COUNTY WILDFIRES OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND AS YOU NOTED. I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF APA CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I WANT TAKE JUST A MINUTE TO START WITH MY OWN -- FIRE STORY IF I CAN. MY WIFE AND I IN OUR THEN NINE YEAR OLD SON WERE SLEEP THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER EIGHTH. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WOKE TO THE SMELL OF SMOKE IN THE GLOW FIRE IN THE DISTANCE. WE INITIALLY EVACUATED TO MY WIFE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE IN A MOBILE HOME PARK IN SANTA ROSA. UNFORTUNATELY WE ENDED UP EVACUATING GRANDMA IS WELL IN HER PARK WAS LARGELY DESTROYED BY EIGHT IN ENTIRELY SEPARATE FAR THE ROAD INTO SANTA ROSA FROM THE NORTHEAST THAT NIGHT. DESPITE OUR EXPERIENCE LOSING A HOME THAT WE DEARLY LOVED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WE OWNED AND ONE OF OUR TWO DOGS. I CONSIDER OUR FAMILY TO HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE WE WERE SPARED THE HORRIFYING EXPERIENCES THAT MANY OF MY NEIGHBORS WENT THROUGH. RUSHING OUT OF THEIR HOMES WITH THEIR YARDS ALREADY ON FIRE ABANDONING BURNING CARS AND STRIKING OUT ON FOOT. CUTTING THROUGH BARBED WIRE FENCE AND DRIVING OVER LAND WITH A CAR FULL OF KIDS WHEN THE ROADS WERE BLOCKED BY FIRE AND FALLEN TREES. SHELTERING IN PLACE WHILE THE HOMES AROUND THEM BURNED IN LARGE NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET WHO PASSED AWAY IN HIS HOME. BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET OUT. OVER 70% OF THE HOMES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WERE DESTROYED IN JUST UNDER HALF OF THESE. OUR UNDER ALL ARE NOW BEING REBUILT ALMOST TWO YEARS AFTER THE EVENT. BUT THAT MEANS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE NOT YET STARTED REBUILDING. SOME CAN'T AFFORD IT TOO PERVASIVE OVER UNDER INSURANCE A HIGH BUILDING COSTS. BUT IS ALSO A TRAUMA THAT IS THAT VISITS PEOPLE IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION. AND THEY REMAIN TRAUMATIZED BY WITH THE EXPERIENCE THAT NIGHT AND THEN IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED THAT IT'S PALPABLE WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM. IT REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT INTERFERES WITH THE FOCUS AND DECISIVENESS THAT'S NECESSARY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A A REBUILDING PROJECT SO MY GUESS IS AROUND REBUILD. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FACE THE ADDITIONAL STRESSES AND DELAY THE LIKE THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESS ENTAILS. IN MY POINT IN RAISING THESE ISSUES IS TO EMPHASIZE THE HUMAN TOLL THAT THESE WILDFIRES TAKE I KNOW THE THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER IS VERY VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS I'M SURE -- BUT IT'S MORE THAN STRUCTURES IT'S MORE THAN DOLLARS IT'S MORE THAN MATERIAL THINGS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO KEEP IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS. AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THESE HAZARDS AND REDUCE RISK IN THE FUTURE. IN WITH THIS IN MIND I'M OUT OF TOUCH ON AN ISSUE THAT YOU'VE ALREADY TOUCHED ON HERE. BUT IT'S REALLY A SHIFT THAT I BELIEVE IS NEEDED AND HOW WE PLAN FOR WILD FIRE HAZARDS. IN THE NEAR OUR COMMUNITIES IN ABOUT PLANNING FOR DEVELOPMENT GENERALLY IN WHILE FAR AREAS. SO IT'S A AS THE FOLKS FROM CAL FIRE INDICATED IT SHOULD BE PAINFULLY OBVIOUS TO ALL OF US NOW THAT WE LIVE. IN AN ENVIRONMENT MORE FOR FIRES AN ONION UNAVOIDABLE PART OF OUR LANDSCAPE. EVEN WITHOUT A SINGLE HUMAN STRUCTURED OUR STATE CALIFORNIA WOULD STILL HAVE WILDFIRES SOME OF THOSE FIRES WOULD BE VERY LARGE. IN THIS NATURAL PLANT LANDSCAPES DO. THE WILD LANDS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ADAPTED TO THIS WILDFIRE REGIME AND NOW WE HAVE SCIENCE CALLED FIRE ECOLOGY. THE TELLS US THAT MANY OF CAL CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY RELY ON REGULAR FIRES. TO MAINTAIN THEIR ECOLOGICAL HEALTH AND DIVERSITY. BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T LIVE IN A PRISTINE STATE OF NATURE ALREADY ABOUT A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS. LIVE AND WORK IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREAS AND MORE PEOPLE ARE COMING ALL THE TIME. AND AS YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST CENTURY OR SO WHILE FAR MANAGEMENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN BASED ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION. AND WE NOW KNOW AS THE AGAINST THE FOLKS FROM CAL FIRE TOLD YOU. THE ONE RESULT OF THAT APPROACH IS A HUGE BUILD UP OF WILD LAND FUELS THE CONCERT CONTRIBUTES CONSIDERABLY TO THE DRAMATIC AND CATASTROPHIC FIRES. THAT WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY. WE'VE GOTTEN SO GOOD AT FIRE SUPPRESSION THOUGH THAT WE HAVE IT'S LED TO A CERTAIN HUBRIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE OF THINGS IN MY VIEW. THE SHARE OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION IN WE AREAS -- IT CONTINUES TO GROW EVEN NOW. AND HERE'S THE IS HERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE INCLUDES FAR MORE THAN JUST THE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. MY OWN HOME FOR EXAMPLE WAS IN AN AREA THAT WAS MAPPED BY CAL FIRE IS ONLY MODERATE -- FIRE HAZARD SECURITY. WE'VE DEVELOPED FIRE SAFE STANDARDS AND WE BUILDING CODES THAT ESSENTIALLY SAY GO AHEAD AND BUILD IN THESE AREAS WE CAN PROTECT YOU. AND I THINK THAT THE THE THE PUTTING THE LIE TO THAT IF YOU WILL IS SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US ARE REALIZING COLLECTIVELY HERE THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. AND AS WE'VE DONE THIS THOUGH AS THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS INCREASED OUT IN THESE WE WE AREAS. WE'VE ADDED LITERALLY ANOTHER MAJOR SOURCE OF FUEL TO THE FIRE. THE FIRE STORMS WE EXPERIENCE IN CINEMA COUNTY BUTTE COUNTY WERE EVERY BIT AS MUCH STRUCTURE FIRES AS THEY WERE WILD LAND FIRES. MEANING THAT THE STRUCTURES THAT WE HAD PUT IN THE PATH OF WILD LAND FIRES. ESSENTIALLY BECAME THE FUEL THAT RESULTED IN EVEN LARGER AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE FIRES. TO THE POINT THAT -- IN OUR AREA FOR EXAMPLE. FIRE SAFE STANDARDS AND WE BUILDING CODES OFFERED ONLY LIMITED PROTECTION FROM WIND DRIVEN FIRE STORMS THAT -- IN AREAS THAT WERE DEVELOPED AT SUBURBAN DENSITIES. SO THE SHIFT I'M TALKING ABOUT MEANS THAT INSTEAD OF PRETENDING THAT WE CAN KEEP BUILDING IN HAZARDOUS AREAS. AND ACTUALLY PROTECT OUR HOMES AND BUSINESSES AGAINST LITERAL FIRE STORMS. DRIVEN BY HIGH WINDS AND EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO STOP MAKING THINGS WORSE BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF NEW DEVELOPMENT. THAT OCCURS IN THESE AREAS THIS STARTS WITH GOOD LAND USE PLANNING. THE REDUCES DENSITIES IN OUTLYING AREAS AND STRONGLY DISCOURAGES UP ZONING AND SUBDIVISIONS AND FIRE HAZARD AREAS. AND FOR THIS REASON APA CALIFORNIA'S VERY HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTING THIS YEAR -- EIGHT SB EIGHT ONE EIGHTY TWO WHICH I KNOW YOU YOUR COMMITTEES WILL BE HEARING AT SOME POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE OTHER REASON THE GOOD PLANNING IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE IS NEEDED IS TO ADDRESS THE OTHER SUBJECT OF YOUR HEARING TODAY HOUSING DELIVERY. FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS. TO GUIDE LAND USE DEVELOPMENT IN WAYS THAT MAKE OUR STATE MORE SUSTAINABLE I TALKING HERE ABOUT LAWS LIKE. THE SMART GROWTH PRINCIPLES OF AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN AND THE LINK BETWEEN THE LOCATION OF NEW LAND USES. AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS UNDER SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE ALL THESE BILLS ALIGNED WITH THE COMMON THEME THAT IF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO GROW MORE SUSTAINABLY WE NEED TO ACTIVELY DISCOURAGE INCREASE ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT IN SOME AREAS AND DISCOURAGED IN OTHERS. IN MY HOME REGION THE BAY AREA GROWTH IN HOUSING ALLOCATIONS ARE ALREADY FOCUSED AS THEY SHOULD BE IN URBAN CORE AND JOB RICH AREAS AND AWAY FROM GREEN FIELD DEVELOPMENT IN AGRICULTURAL IN OUTLYING AREAS. SO WHAT IS THIS MEETING WILD FIRE HAZARD AREAS IT MEANS QUITE SIMPLY. THAT ADDING MORE FAR FLUNG RURAL SUBDIVISIONS IN OUTLYING WILD FIRE HAZARD AREAS IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE LAND USE PRACTICE. IT MEANS THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES WITH WE WE ARE IS THE TO FOCUS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE LEASE HAZARDOUS AREAS. EVEN IF IT MEANS INCREASING DENSITIES IN THOSE AREAS. AND THEY NEED TO INCLUDE ROBERT ROBUST FIRE PROTECTION IN MITIGATION MEASURES. IN APPROVING THOSE TWO DEVELOPMENTS AND ALL OF THAT TAKES GOOD PLANNING. EVERY COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S URBAN OR RURAL NEEDS TO MEET THEIR AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS AT STATE ROUTE LAW REQUIRES AND AS OUR COMMUNITY SO DESPERATELY NEEDS. BUT THEY NEED TO DO IT IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY. BUT COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO APPROVE NEW UPSCALE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS OR RECREATION. OR RECREATIONAL OR SECOND HOMES SUBDIVISIONS IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS DEVELOPMENT THAT ONLY INCREASES HAZARDS FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU A CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME IS SCARY. BEST TO SEE YOU. THANK YEAR CHAIRS -- AND MEMBERS OF TAKE COMMITTEES -- FOR ASKING ME HERE TO KIND OF SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HAS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I HAVE. YOU HEARD THE PREVIOUS PANEL TALK ABOUT. ACRONYMS THAT NOBODY REMEMBERS -- MAYBE EVEN ASKED FOR SOME OF THAT TESTIMONY IN WRITING SO THAT YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THAT. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE CHALLENGE OF TAKING EVERYTHING THAT COMES DOWN FROM THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL AS EITHER A MANDATE OR A BEST PRACTICE OR TIED TO FUNDING AND MOST OF US WANT THAT FUNDING. WE NEED THAT MONEY TO DO THE WORK THAT WE HAVE THAT. GIVEN MY CHOICE. 1100% OF THE TIME I'LL TAKE ANY MONEY THAT COMES MY WAY AND PUT IT TO STAFFING BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HAVE. A LACK OF PERSONNEL SHE JUST SURELY TO GET THIS INFORMATION ACROSS TO THE PUBLIC. THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THE PLANS HOW EVERYTHING INTERACTS WHAT WE NEED THEM TO KNOW IS SO COMPLEX. THAT SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP GOING OVER. BASS LINE AFTER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S VERY CHALLENGING FOR US AND REALLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THAT IS IN PERSON -- I CAN SHARE THINGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA I CAN PUSH OUT WEBSITE INFORMATION BUT NOTHING HEADS HOME MORE THAN STANDING IN FRONT OF THAT RESIDENT. AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME. SO I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO AND I'VE GIVEN YOU AN INFOGRAPHIC ABOUT THREE MAIN PLANNING -- KIND OF OUR PLANS IF YOU WILL. AND PLANNING EFFORTS THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN THE FIRST ONE BEING THE GENERAL PLAN NOW OBVIOUSLY UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE AS SIX FIVE THREE HUNDRED AND WE HAVE A MANDATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO ADOPT A GENERAL PLAN. BUT IN MANY JURISDICTION GENERAL PLANS ARE NOT FREQUENTLY TOUCH OR REVISIONS. IN A WHOLE SOMETIMES ONLY PARTS IT'S BECAUSE OF ONE SPECIFIC MANDATE. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DOESN'T TYPICALLY CONTROL THE TIMELINE OR THE STATUS OF GENERAL PLAN UPDATE SO IT MAKES IT VERY CHALLENGING TO PUT SOMETHING IN THAT AT THAT LEVEL OF PLAN IN OUR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- THE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN THAT'S ONE BIT MY JURISDICTIONS SPECIFICALLY IS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE JUST WENT THROUGH OUR FIVE YEAR FEMA PLANNING REVISION CYCLE THAT IS A FIVE YEAR CYCLE. WHEN WE TIE THINGS TO THAT PLAN YOU HAVE THE PROPENSITY TO ONLY SEE THAT DONE IN FIVE YEARS TIME FROM TODAY IF THEY GET APPROVED BY SCHEME OF THIS YEAR? SO AGAIN ANOTHER LINK THE STANDARD IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING INTEGRATED BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL FIVE YEARS OF THAT TIME INCLUDES PUBLIC MEETINGS. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S IN ABOUT FOUR PUBLIC MEETING IS WHERE WE MESSAGED OUT TO EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTY. TO COME AND SHARE THEIR PERSPECTIVE WITH US. ABOUT MITIGATION WHAT PROJECTS WE SHOULD BE IT -- TACKING WITH THESE FUNDS YOU HEARD SOME PHENOMENAL. FUNDING AMOUNTS KIND OF THROWN OUT WITH THE LAST PANEL AND TELLING YOU THEY'RE SMALL WHEN THEY GET TO MY LEVEL THEY'RE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WHEN THEY GET TO MY LEVEL. THEY'RE VERY HARD TO GET. SO IT'S NOT AN END ALL BE ALL SOLUTION FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WE'RE WE'RE VERY PROGRESSIVE ANY OTHER WE HAVE CLIMATE CHANGE IN OUR MITIGATION PLAN NOW THE ONLY. LEGAL STANDARD IN THERE IS TO HAVE THE NATURAL HAZARDS. NOT ANY OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL ARE MANMADE HAZARDS WHICH INCLUDES WILD FIRE. SO THAT MAKES IT SO THAT IN A LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY HAS TO BE PROGRESSIVE HOUSE TO GO OUT HAS TO TALK PEOPLE INTO INCLUDING MORE THAN WHAT'S MANDATED AN ALREADY VERY LONG TRYING CYCLE. THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF HANDS ON AND TOUCHING OF OUR COMMUNITY I CAN TELL YOU THIS PUBLIC MEETINGS WE HAD AN AVERAGE OF THREE PEOPLE SHOW UP TO EACH OF THEM. THREE OUT OF A COUNTY OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND OKAY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT THE CITY OF DAVIS CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS. AT THE WINTERS PUBLIC SAFETY BUILDING THESE ARE NOT SMALL VENUES WERE PLANNING FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE TO COME WE WANT TO QUESTIONS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. WHEN WE WE HAVE EIGHTEEN PAGES OF MITIGATION PROJECTS IN THE NEW YOLO COUNTY HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN? WE HAVE SOME THAT WE'VE ALREADY ACTUALLY APPLIED NOTICE OF INTENSE TO APPLY FOR MITIGATION FUNDS OUT OF MULTIPLE MEDICATION PATHWAYS PRE DISASTER MITIGATION -- MITIGATION MONIES THAT OPEN UP AFTER A DISASTER HAPPENS ALL OF THOSE WE TRY TO MAKE USE OF ALL OF THEM. SOME OF THEM WE'VE BEEN TURNED DOWN FOUR AND FIVE TIMES IN JUST RECENTLY ON THIS. THE SIX APPLICATION DID IT GET AWARDED. SO IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING TO GET THOSE GRANTS EVEN THE MONEY IS THERE AND IT'S THERE FOR VERY GOOD REASON AND WE ALL WANTED IT IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE YOU'RE COMPETING AGAINST. EVERYONE OF THE OTHER FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CITIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS LARGE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES -- ELECT UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE THEY ALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR THESE GRANTS. AND IF THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL BASES TO OUTSOURCE THEIR GRANT WRITING AND THINGS LIKE THAT QUITE FREQUENTLY THEY WILL BEAT US OUT IF WE DO IT IN HOUSE. AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FACT WE REALLY REALLY WANT TO THAT MONEY WHEN WE TRAVEL TO THE VERY BOTTOM THIRD SECTION THAT INFOGRAPHIC WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN. THAT'S ONE OF MY INDUSTRY FREQUENTLY TOUCHES ALL THE TIME -- IF WE'RE FOLLOWING THE COMPREHENSIVE PREPAREDNESS GUIDE AND SET FORTH BY FEMA WE'RE UPDATING THAT PLAN EVERY YEAR OR TWO YEARS THE MAIN BASE PLAN. AND THEN WHAT A COMPANIES THAT BASS PLAN IS ANY NUMBER OF ANNEXES INYO COUNTY WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE INDEPENDENT PLANS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN. ANYTHING FROM HOW TO ISSUE EMERGENCY CAL FRESH CARDS TO PEOPLE WHO NEED THOSE FOOD STAMPS AFTER EVERYTHING THEY HAVE WAS LOST BY A WILD FIRE OR FLOOD. BECAUSE ALL OF OUR PLANS ARE ALL HAZARDS WE'RE ROLLING OUT BRAND NEW EVACUATIONS OWNING WE HAVE A COMMUNITY MEETING TONIGHT IN WINTERS. SHAMELESS PLUG -- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR FOUR YEARS TO GET THE COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY NEED TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM WITH ON THE SYSTEM FOR FOUR YEARS. OUT OF THE ESTIMATED TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN POPULATION FOR YOLO COUNTY WHICH IS OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE CAN ESTIMATED NOT CENSUS DATA. NOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DATA POINTS IN OUR MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IN IT OUR CULMINATED FROM WHITE PAGES DATA YELLOW PAGES STATUS IS NOT IN REVERSE NINE ONE ONE DATA THAT WE PAY. FOR BUT OUT OF THE CITIZEN OPTIONS WE HAVE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE LESS THAN 10% OF THE COUNTY. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO IN MANY CASES IT'S BECAUSE OUT OF FOUR YEARS THEY HAVEN'T HEARD IT UP OF IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY SIGNS WE PUT INSIDE YOLO BUS WHICH IS RUNNING RIGHT NOW IN EVERY SINGLE BUS IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT I WAS ON DAVIS -- MEDIA BROADCAST VIDEO TAPES THE OTHER DAY WITH THAT SAME MESSAGE SO NOW THAT'S UP ON THEIR WEBSITE AND ON THE PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNEL WE'VE DONE KCRA RADIO SPOTS. OUR OUR KTLA THINK IT WHATEVER IT WAS IN SACRAMENTO. THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO EITHER WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME WE RUN ANNUAL TESTS OF THAT SYSTEM. WE ASK FOR PEOPLE TO FOLLOW OUR INSTRUCTIONS WE'RE GETTING LOTS OF COMMUNITY FEEDBACK WHICH IS REALLY GREAT ON THE EVACUATION PLANNING THAT WERE ROLLING OUT RIGHT NOW. LOTS OF THINGS WE'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF AND SOME OF THEM ARE SO SIMPLE THAT WE WONDER WHY WE DIDN'T THINK OF THEM I DON'T KNOW START A COMMUNITY MEETING THE OTHER NIGHT. A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAME UP TO ME AND SAID. WELL I HAVE LARGE ANIMALS OUR FORCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT I NEED A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO KNOW WHERE TO TAKE THEM AND WHEN WE SAY WE PUT IT OUT ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNEL WE PUT IT ON THIS WEBSITE WE BLASTED OUT THROUGH THE SYSTEM. HE SAYS I DON'T DO SOCIAL MEDIA I WANT A PHONE AND YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO CALL WHEN WE WERE UP IN THE CAPE PAY VALLEY. I NEED A PRINT VERSION OF THIS MAP I DON'T USE A COMPUTER THERE'S NO CELL SIGNAL UP HERE. I CAN'T USE MASS NOTIFICATION IN SYSTEM IN THE CAPE PAY VALLEY. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGERS HAVE CONNECTING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY WILD LAND. PLANNING PROCESS TO THE URBAN FORESTRY. PLANS THAT ARE NOW INCLUDING WILDFIRE INFORMATION IN THEM. COURTESY OF OTHER CAL FIRE GRANTS ARE ALL GREAT PLANNING PROCESS SEES. IF WE HAVE THREE TO FOUR URBAN FORESTRY PLANS AND THEN FOR COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE PROTECTION PLANS. MY INDUSTRY HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE ALL THOSE PLANS WORK TOGETHER AND LET THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY KNOW WHERE THE CROSSOVERS ARE. IS WE'RE NOT JUST PLANNING FOR ONE TINY LITTLE CIRCLE OF OUR JURISDICTIONS THOSE HAZARDS. IF IT'S WATER IT FLOWS OUTSIDE OF THE AREA IF IT'S FIRE IT BURNS WE'VE HAD HISTORICAL FIRES INYO COUNTY. THAT OUTPACE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES ON I FIVE BECAUSE OF THE WINDS BLOWING THEM THAT FAST. FOUR OUT OF FOUR YEARS AND I'VE BEEN EMERGENCY MANAGER -- WE'VE HAD OUR ANNUAL FIRE OUTSIDE OF WINTERS MOST PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER OUR FIRE OUR NINETY THOUSAND SQUARE ACRE FIRE LAST YEAR. BECAUSE BECAUSE NOBODY DIED AND NOBODY REALLY LOST A PRIMARY RESIDENCE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A WHAT THEY CALL A TYPE ONE LEVEL INCIDENT FOUR OUT OF FOUR YEARS IN YOLO COUNTY AND IT CROSSED. INTO NAPA AND SOLANO COUNTIES IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE SO EMERGENCY MANAGERS FROM THREE COUNTIES HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. TO MAKE SURE OUR PLANS TO JIVE LOCKED TOGETHER AND WILL WORK TOGETHER ESPECIALLY FOR PUSHING OUR POPULATION INTO. THE NEIGHBORING COUNTY. SO THERE THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE CHALLENGES I CAN LIST THEM FOR DAYS IT'S REALLY THAT INHERENT. THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON WE HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE IT'S VERY CHALLENGING -- PLANNING. LANDSCAPE AT THIS POINT THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS WE NEED THEM TO DO LOTS OF THINGS WE NEED THEM TO AND TO SIGN UP FOR MANUALLY -- MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A KIT. THAT THEY ARE INFORMED THAT THEY KNOW THEIR PRIMARY EVACUATION ROUTE AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT TONIGHT IN THE CITY OF WINTERS. IF THE CHOICE IS TO GO TO MY CHILD SOCCER GAME FOR MY GRAND CHILD'S PLAY. OR COME LISTEN TO THE EMERGENCY MANAGER OF THE COUNTY TELL ME WHAT MY PRIORITIZE EVACUATION ROUTE IS. THE CHILD AND GRANDCHILD THEY'RE GOING TO WIN. THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S HEARTFELT AND I'LL TALK TO FOLKS MORE LATER. GOOD AFTERNOON MR WITH. SO A LITTLE BIT BETTER. HI MY NAME'S KEITH WOODS ON THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE NORTH COAST BUILDERS EXCHANGE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A BUILDER SIX CHANGES YOUR IN THE MAJORITY OF MONTHS MOST PEOPLE. SIMPLY PUT WE'RE CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION OF THE ONE I WORK FOR FOR THE PAST NINETEEN YEARS REPRESENT SO ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CONTRACTORS AND PEOPLE ASSOCIATED CONSTRUCTION. IN CINEMA MENDOCINO LAKE AND NAPA FIRESTONE SO WE'VE BEEN VERY BUSY FOR THE PAST -- EIGHTEEN MONTHS -- THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING -- SHOW YOU HOW IT TO UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT I THINK THIS IS THE CHIU HEAR FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF BUILDERS I DO WITH HOME BUILDERS AND OTHERS. EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE TO UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS I GAVE AWAY MY WARRIORS ROCKETS TICKETS TO THE PLAYOFF GAME TONIGHT -- THERE BY MAKING YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THE ONLY CURRY THAT ALL BE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH -- FOR THE AFTERNOON BUT IT'S WORTH IT IT'S A PLEASURE TO TO BE HERE LET ME GET RIGHT TO THE POINT IN MY LIMITED TIME I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU NOT THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LOOKING DOWN -- THE VISION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A REBUILD -- I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE POURING -- FOUNDATIONS AND HAMMERING NAILS AND GETTING PEOPLE BACK INTO THEIR HOMES I'LL MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS AND A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS ON IF YOU WANT SOME SPECIFICS ON WHAT. THOSE OF US THAT ARE IN AND AROUND THE INDUSTRY THING HOW -- WAITS AT THE STATE COULD HELP ALL OF BRING THOSE TO YOU -- IT'S BEEN A DICKENSIAN PASSED -- EIGHTEEN MONTHS IT'S BEEN THE BEST OF TIMES AND THE WORST OF TIMES THE WORST OF TIMES IS VERY CLEAR WE HAD -- IN FOR COUNTY AREA SEVEN THOUSAND PLUS HOMES DESTROYED ANOTHER COUPLE THOUSAND BILL OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER BUILDINGS AND IT'S JUST BEEN LIKE NOTHING I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED HAPPENING. AND I COULDN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING WORSE UNTIL OUR FRIENDS IN PARADISE I WENT THROUGH WHAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH DOT ALLOWING EVERY OUT A PROBLEM THAT WE HAD IT ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE NUMBER OF US FROM THE NORTH BAY BEEN OVER -- TO CHICO IN PARADISE TO TRY AND HELP OUT AN ADVISE WHAT WE LEARNED AND I GO BACK BOTH HARDENED AND DISHEARTENED THE WORST OF IT IS SPEND THE DEVASTATION THE PERSONAL TOLD IT'S TAKEN. ON US SO MANY FAMILIES IN CENTER -- SO WE'RE WE'RE HEADQUARTERED NOW CENTER ROSE ALONE WE LOST AROUND FIFTY THREE HUNDRED MAKE THAT CINEMA COUNTY THREE THOUSAND PLUS IN SANTA ROSA DEVASTATION LIKE YOU CAN IMAGINE TO YOU'VE DRIVEN THROUGH IT. FLOWN OVER OR SEEN EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED -- AS A SIDE NOTE OF IN THE GOOD THINGS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF IT IS THE UNITY I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE OUR COMMUNITY CAN COME TOGETHER NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS WHO. EITHER LOST OR DID LOSE THEIR HOME -- PUBLIC OFFICIALS THE MEDIA BUILDING COMMUNITY THE BEST OF ALL OF THIS IS BEEN THE THE UNITY AND I I COULDN'T. I COULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT SINGLING OUT A SENATORS MCGUIRE AND DODD AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM WOOD FOR THE YEOMAN WORK IF THEY DID -- TIRELESSLY IN TRYING TO HELP COORDINATE -- EFFORTS TO REBUILD AND BRING -- THE POWER OF THE STATE TO THE LOCAL LEVER TO HELP US OUT SO I I WANTED TO SINGLE THEM OUT -- YOU KNOW -- THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A FEW POINTS ON AND WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU THE FLAVOR OF IT FROM WORKERS AND SOMEWHAT STACCATO FASHION HERE -- NO POINTS I WANT TO MAKE -- ONE THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS DISASTER IS AT THE ROOT OF EVERYONE OF OUR REBUILDING PROBLEMS OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO THIS SO WE'RE LESS THAN 20% FAR LESS THAN 20% REBUILD WITH PEOPLE IN. A BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE FIVE YEAR MARK WILL PROBABLY HAVE 60% PLUS OF HOMES TO REBUILD OR BUILT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT. TO FEMA TOLD ME WHEN I WAS WORKING AT THE FEMA CENTER RIGHT AFTER THE FIRES ON A STE NATIONWIDE ON ANY A NATIONAL DISASTER MAJOR DISASTER. 435% OF PEOPLE DON'T REBUILD FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WELL I'VE TALKED TO HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BUILDERS AND LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF FIRE VICTIMS IN MEETINGS AT NIGHTS AND ON WEEKENDS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP THEM AND I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT 40% OF OUR PEOPLE PROBABLY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS ARE NOT GOING TO REBUILD. AND THE STATE REALLY NEED UNDERSTAND OF HOUSEHOLDS SERIES OF AN ISSUE THIS IS FOR A COMMUNITY TO LOSE THAT MANY PEOPLE -- THE SANTA ROSA JUNIOR COLLEGE A CLOSE FOR TWO WEEKS AFTER THE FIRES -- IN OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN THEY OPEN THEY WERE A THOUSAND STUDENT SHORT WHO WOULD DISAPPEAR -- THE CENTER OF THE CITY SCHOOLS LAW SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY STUDENTS WHO DID NOT COME BACK TO CLASS AND THE TOLL THAT TAKES ON THE COMMUNITY IS STANDING. UP FOR BUILDERS OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROBLEM -- I NEED TO GIVE YOU A FACTOID THERE WERE MORE IN IN THE FIRE IF WE EXPERIENCE THERE WERE MORE HOMES AND BUSINESSES DESTROYED THEN THERE ARE LICENSED CONTRACTORS. SO IF YOU WONDER WHY WILL ALWAYS TAKE OR IN MY MIND HALF A DECADE TO A DECADE FOR US TO LOOK ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT WE LOOK LIKE BEFORE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CONTRACTORS AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE WORKERS. THE THE IT'S CALLED GREAT PROBLEMS I WILL GIVE A ALSO CREDIT TO THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD -- THEY HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN ACCELERATING TRAINING FOR NEW CONTRACTORS THE LICENSING OF NEW CONTRACTOR TO GET THEM -- ELIGIBLE TO BE DOING THE WORK BECAUSE WE NEED THEM -- ON A REALLY BADLY AND THEY THEY'VE BEEN A GREAT HELP ON THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WAS BUSY BEFORE THE FIRE SO THEIR BODY UNDERSTANDS EVERYONE WAS BUSY. DURING A RECESSION WELL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY LOST HALF OF ITS PAYROLL HALF OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WERE NO LONGER CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AT THE END OF THE RECESSION THEY WENT ON TO DO OTHER THINGS SO WE WERE STRAPPED. AND IT HAS CAUSED GREAT DELAYS ON OUR PART NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD BUT THEY CONTRACTORS HAVE PEOPLE LINED UP WHO WANT TO GET THEIR HOMES BUILT. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE WORKERS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM POINT NUMBER TWO BESIDES A SHORTAGE OF CONTRACTORS BUT GENERAL AND SUBS -- I MENTIONED THERE ARE NO WHERE NEAR ENOUGH WORKERS THE CONSTRUCTION WORKER YOU SHORTAGE THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT IS VERY RELIGIOUS NON MANUFACTURED AT ALL WE LOST SO MANY OF THEM DURING THE RECESSION. WE'RE TRYING TO REGENERATE OURSELVES HOW CAN STATE GOVERNMENT HELP -- I I CAN ADVISE YOU ANYTHING YOU CAN DO WITH CP PROGRAMS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS STATE A APPRENTICESHIPS PROGRAM THROUGH THE UNIONS FOR THE GREAT TRAINING THAT THEY DO ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN -- SUPPORT THAT -- LEADS TO MORE WORKERS WILL ACCELERATE NOT ONLY IN PARADISE BUT IN MENDOCINO CINEMA LAKE AND NAPA COUNTY AS WELL WE'RE GROWING OUR OWN THAT ARE BUILDERS EXCHANGE WE GOT A GRANT -- FOR TO EXPAND WHAT WE HAVE IS A PROGRAM ON NORTH BAY CONSTRUCTION CORPS WHERE A TAKING HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS SO WHO ARE INTERESTED IN CONSTRUCTION THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A FOURTEEN WEEK PROGRAM ONE NIGHT A WEEK ONE SATURDAY. AND THEN A TWO WEEK BOOT CAMP WHETHER OUT ON A PROJECT AND WE FIGURED OUT AS I INTERVIEW -- BUILDERS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET NEW WORKERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE INTO THE AREA IS GROW OUR OWN SO WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT ON THE MARKET PLACE. UNDER THAN FIFTY POTENTIALLY SHARP YOUNG NEW WORKERS WHO ARE PHENOMENAL A READY TO GO SO WE CAN DO THOSE SORTS OF THINGS I CAN TELL YOU IS A BY ANOTHER POINT. WHAT WE LEARNED IS A PROJECT OF A BUILDING PROJECT LIKE IS HAPPENING IN THE NORTH BAY DOESN'T FIT A BUILDER'S NORMAL MODEL? YET LET ME EXPLAIN THAT A BUILDER'S HIRED BY A DEVELOPER THE DEVELOPER HAS TEN ACRES -- TWENTY ACRES THEY WANNA BUILD A DEVELOPMENT OF A HUNDRED FIFTY HOMES SO THEY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT THEY THEY BY THE LAND THEY PUT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDERS BUILD A HOMES THEY MARKET THEM THEY SELL WOMAN THEY LEAVE. THIS DOESN'T FIT IN PARADISE OR IN OUR AREA ANY BUILDING PROJECT MODEL THAT ANY OF THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT WORK WITH HAS EVER EXPERIENCED THEY NOW HAVE FIVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT DEVELOPERS. AND THEY'RE NOT USED TO BUILDING A HOME OVER THERE THEN MOVE THEIR CREW BILL HOME OVER THERE THERE THERE AND THERE IT IS THROWN US FOR A LOOP. AND COFFEE PARK THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOMES WERE LOST THESE ARE THE EASY BUILD SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOTS OF WITH -- THAT ARE FLAT EASIER TO BUILD ON AND THERE AREN'T ANY GIVEN TIME A HUNDRED OR MORE DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS AND WORKERS ROAMING AROUND THE STREETS AND AND TRAFFIC CLOGGING UP WITH TRUCKS. THE COORDINATION ANYTHING THE STATE CAN DO TO HELP A COORDINATE THINGS LIKE HIS AND IT'S PROBABLY MORE LOCAL BUT BE AWARE OF THE SERIOUS PROBLEM WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP IN AN AREA THAT'S ENTIRELY. DIFFERENT THAN A MAJOR PROJECT MY LAST COUPLE POINTS BEST THING FOR HOME BUILDERS IN THE FAMILIES ARE HELPING IS OF FAST TRACKING -- I GIVE SUCH CREDIT TO OUR CITY OF SANTA ROSA IN PARTICULAR COUNTY OF CINNAMON PERMITS CINEMA THEY UP TO THEIR GAME. THEY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE INSTEAD OF THE SIX OR NINE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS TO GET A PERMIT FOR SOME STRUCTURES AND HOMES. IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER I BY KATE GORDON I THINK FIVE DAYS IS THEIR GOAL THEY'VE BEEN INUNDATED IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS SINCE THAT TWO YEAR RENTAL ASSISTANCE FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES. RUNS OUT IN OCTOBER SO THERE'S A TSUNAMI OF PERMIT APPLICATIONS THAT'S BEEN COMING IN THE REBUILD LOOKS LIKE A HOCKEY STICK IT WAS FLAT FOR SIX MONTHS AND FOR LAST SIX MONTHS TWO YEARS JUST SPIKED UP. AND THE CITY AND THE COUNTY HAVE DONE WONDERFUL WORK AND I GIVE THEM A FULL CREDIT BOTTOM LINE -- THE BUILDERS ARE THERE AND READY TO GO IT'S THE WORKERS -- SHORTAGE THAT'S HOLDING THINGS UP AND NOT THE PERMITTING IT'S AROUND TEN TO TWELVE DAYS NOW TO GET A PERMIT AND BUILDERS AND FAMILIES ARE JUST ECSTATIC AT THE AT THE CHANGE THE PROBLEM FOR US CITY IN A COUNTY IS -- THE BUILDING DEPARTMENTS WHICH MISTER -- MY FRIEND PETE PARKINSON USED TO HAD NOW WE KNOW THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT YEAH YOU KNOW AND SO NOW WE I'VE TALKED TO TENNIS WHERE IN. THE BUILDING OFFICIALS GENERAL'S WE WANT THEM TO LIFT UP THEIR BEST PRACTICES DURING THE REBUILD AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR THE OTHER HOUSING THAT WE DO NEED. A WRAP UP AND LET ME STRING TAKE OVER HERE IN A MOMENT WHAT I'D LIKE OUT OF YOU I HOPE YOU WILL PROVIDE FUNDING TO THESE CASH STRAPPED GOVERNMENTS. TO HELP THEM ADD STAFFING FOR PERMITTING. THE THEY GET YEAH THEY'RE STRETCHED THIN AND THE BEST THING YOU COULD DO IS SAY WE'VE GOT A LITTLE -- STASH HERE THE WERE WILLING TO GIVE YOU TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE OR OUT SOURCE THE PERMITTING SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS MOVING ISN'T JUST FOR THE BUILDER SYSTEMS FOR THE FIRE VICTIMS. TO HAVE EMERGENCY FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR SPECIAL PROGRAMS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN THINK OF WE REALIZE RIGHT AWAY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF A CONSTRUCTION WORKERS LOST EVERY TOOL THEY'VE GOT -- CONTRACTORS DID SO -- OUR ORGANIZATION TO BUILDERS EXCHANGE -- WE CREATED A TOOL REPLACEMENT PROGRAM WE GOT A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DONATIONS AND OF TOOLS HELD OPEN HOUSE AND TRIED TO GET THEM BACK TO WITH THE TOOLS OF THEIR TRADE. SOMETIMES WE COULD HAVE DONE MORE IF WE HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE FUNDING TO LEVERAGE THAT FUNDING TO BUY MORE TOOLS TO PROVIDE PEOPLE -- THREE CAREFULLY REVIEW IT WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL THE CODES CHANGES AND UPGRADES THAT ARE BROUGHT TO YOU -- THEY'RE ALL GREAT A BY ENERGY EFFICIENCY FIRE RESISTANT MATERIALS -- DEFENSIBLE SPACE THIS IS ALL GREAT BUT THERE'S A REAL PRICE TAG THAT GOES WITH THIS AND WE MAY NOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND ALL THE CODE CHANGES THAT I'M NOT ARGUING AGAINST BUT PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW THEM ONE OF OUR BUILDERS TOOK THE SAME HOME BE BUILT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IN COFFEE PART FIFTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT THREE BEDROOM TWO BATH. AND HE PRICED OUT WHAT IT WOULD BE IF HE REFILL TODAY WITHOUT ALL OF CODE CHANGES AND IT ADDED ONE HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE COST OF REBUILDING THAT HOME. AGAIN I'M NOT ARGUING ABOUT THOUGH AND AND NECESSITY OF THESE CODES BUT PLEASE BE VERY VERY HELPFUL OF FINALLY IN PROSE OF THE POST A DISASTER -- PROVIDE ALL OF FUNDING THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD NEEDS FOR INSPECTORS BEEN ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BECAUSE WE HELD A MEETING THE OTHER NIGHT FOR A BUYER'S REMORSE FOR PEOPLE IT GOT SCREWED BY UNSCRUPULOUS UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS. WHO THE CSO BE HAS BEEN A GREAT AT FERRETING THEM OUT BUT ANY MONEY THEY NEED TO GET -- ENFORCEMENT IN THERE IT'LL SAVE PEOPLE ALL WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE AND A LOT OF MONEY IN THE LONG TERM. FINALLY I GUESS THE STATE. COULD GENERATE A LOT OF GOOD WILL WITH A SIZEABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE KEITH WOODS RETIREMENT FUND I THINK THIS IS A WORTHY CAUSE SAID YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER THANK YOU FOR LET ME HAVE MY TIME HERE TODAY IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO ME TO BE HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER WOODS. I WELCOME MR RING. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN MY NAME'S BRIAN REGAN THIS ISN'T CHAU WITH THAT YOU COUNTY SO THE MUCH CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE I THOUGHT I WOULD FIRST. JUST GIVE YOU ALL A BRIEF UPDATE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UP TO TO THE TOWN AND THAT THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY THE FIRE AND I TAX OR ONE OF THE SUSPECTS EXPRESS MY THANKS. TO SOME GALLAGHER IS BEEN UP THERE AND HOW MANY BUT BY EVERY DAY JUST ABOUT -- IN -- FOR ALL THE EFFORTS HE'S PUT IN -- HELPING TO REBUILD OUR COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THIS QUICK AT THIS IT'S HARDLY IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS TODAY IT'S AFTER UNBELIEVABLE BUT A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD NEWS ABOUT IT START OUT WITH IS THERE ARE THE DEBRIS MISSION IS IN FULL SWING THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED FORTY CRUISE UP THERE. WITH OUR STATE -- THE STATE CONTRACTORS CALLAWAY -- YES PROGRAM AND THEY'RE DOING SOME TREMENDOUS WORK -- AT AS OF THIS MORNING THERE WAS OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED LOTS THAT HAVE BEEN NOW CLEANED. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WHICH IS A PRETTY PRESS OF OF OF THERE'S OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND LOTS THAT WERE DESTROYED -- WITH THAT OVER FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN [inaudible] CLEARED SO. IT'S TECHNICAL IS CLEAN AND IT'S CLEAR THESE FOR OVER FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES CAN ACTUALLY NOW START TO REBUILD PROCESS OF THAT SO I THINK IT IT'S SOME POSITIVE NEWS FOR THE COMMUNITY -- STILL LOTS OF WORK TO DO TRANSBAIKALIA NEXT TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT IS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN AS FAR AS CHALLENGES GO TO HAVEN'T DISCUSSED YET HERE TODAY THAT I KNOW SOMEONE GALLAGHER IS VERY VERY WELL AWARE OF BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE ON EVERYONE'S. MIND -- FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IMPACTED IN A WAY SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT -- YOU COUNTY WAS IMPACTED. THERE'S THREE OR FOUR SIGNIFICANT ISSUES. BEYOND HOUSING HOUSING CERTAINLY IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE BOTH INFORMALITY IN IN PERMANENT HOUSING. COUPLE OF THINGS RIGHT NOW THAT WE REALLY ARE DOING WITH THIS IS A TREES. NO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT IS NOW -- WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT NEED TO NEED SOME PROCESS A MECHANISM TO BE REMOVED. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THE TREES WE HAVE TREES THAT ARE ON PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY WE HAVE A GOOD PROCESS TO DEAL WITH THOSE PUBLIC TRIP PUBLICLY OWNED MAINTAIN TREES BUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND TREES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY THE IMPACT RIGHT AWAY. COULD POSSIBLY IMPEDE AND FALL ON A NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY -- SOLUTIONS JUST OUR WORD THERE'S NOT A CLEAR SOLUTION FOR THAT RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY ON THAT TRYING TO TRYING TO RESOLVE THAT SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE ISSUE I THINK SHOULD BE ON EVERYONE'S MIND. FOR FOR FUTURE POTENTIAL DISASTERS. ALSO ROADS -- WHEN YOU HAVE SO MUCH? CONSTRUCTION AND HEAVY TRUCKS GOING ON ROADS MANY OF OUR ROADS ARE JUST SIMPLY DETERIORATING ON THEIRS AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP THEY WEREN'T -- I WANTED WERE DESIGNED TO HAVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE DESIGNED HAVE HEAVY TRUCK ON THEM BUT PROBABLY NOT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF TRUCKS A DAY -- THE WEAR AND TEAR INTO THESE ROADS ARE IS TREMENDOUS AND ON I KNOW WE'VE WRITTEN SOME LETTERS AND WE NEEDS WE NEED SOME SUPPORT HERE BECAUSE ONE ACCESS ROAD WHERE ARE LANDFILLS AT RIGHT NOW IS LITERALLY -- ITS NEW ROAD GOING UP BUT FROM NINETY NINE UP TO PARADISE IT IS THERE'S SPOTS WHERE IT'S ALMOST TRINITY GRAVEL SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY BAD. THE WATER SITUATION I KNOW IS VERY WELL KNOWN BOTH IN PARADISE IN IN THE IN A CORPORATE AREA -- CERTAINLY THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE THAT IS HIGH ON OUR PRIORITY LIST TO MAKE SURE WE CAN -- HAVE WATER SYSTEMS PROVIDING CLEAN WATER TO OUR RESIDENTS BECAUSE TO BE A KEY AND CRITICAL COMPONENT BEFORE THE COMMUNITIES TRULY BEGAN. TO REBUILD SO THOSE ARE A FEW THINGS BEYOND JUST THE THE ENTRANT HOUSING IN THE IN THE PERMANENT HOUSING THAT I WANTED AT LEAST HIGHLIGHT AND PUT ON THE RECORD FOR FOR FUTURE -- GENERATIONS. AS FAR AS PLANNING GOES YOU KNOW I THINK. I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO THINK YOU COUNTY WAS PRETTY PREPARED -- I THINK THE TEN A PARADISE TODAY I HAD A VERY ACTIVE FIRE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND THEY HAD EVACUATION ROUTES IN THE AND IS THAT A LOT OF WORK. AND FORTUNATE WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF FIRE SMALL MUCH SMALLER FIRES OVER THE YEARS WHERE WE'VE HAD A PRETTY EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND MERGE OPERATIONS CENTER AND WERE PRETTY PREPARED BUT TO SO MANY DOLLARS POINT THIS IS. PROBABLY A ONCE IN A LIFETIME FIRE ALL THE THE PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR A CRITICAL FIRE LINED UP IN IN IT HAPPENED -- BUT WITH THAT SAID SOME THINGS THAT THAT I LIKE TO RECOMMEND FOR OTHER ENTITIES TO THINK ABOUT IN THE FUTURE. IF YOU'RE IN A BIT HIGH HAZARD AREA OR JUST ANY YEARS IS I THINK. THINKING AHEAD AND KNOWING WHAT YOUR INVENTORY IS LIFE AS FAR AS HOUSING GOES -- WHAT KIND OF PROPERTIES DO YOU HAVE WITH THE PRIVATELY OWNED OR PUBLICLY OWNED WHAT TYPE OF PROPERTIES AT INFRASTRUCTURE ON THEM? BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IF YOU IF YOU ENCOUNTER DISASTER SUCH AS THIS FINDING. AVAILABLE PROPERTY TO PUT MANUFACTURED HOMES TEMPORARY HOUSING ON IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE WE'RE SIX MONTHS INTO THIS AND WE'RE STILL I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET OUR FIRST MH YOU ON SITE I BELIEVE MANUFACTURED HOUSING UNIT FROM FEMA. TOMORROW OR LATER THIS WEEK SO. SIX MONTHS AND WHEN WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH THAT AND YOU KNOW IT. I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH FEMA AND YES HAVE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS BUT THERE'S JUST CHALLENGES. THAT IF YOU CAN DO SOME FORWARD THINKING PLAN AHEAD I THINK WOULD HELP US IN A HELP INTO THESE IN THE FUTURE SO. AGAIN IDENTIFY PROPERTIES POTENTIAL RENTAL CAPACITY AGAIN WE ARE IN A COMMUNITY WITHIN THAT HAD NEXT AND WE WERE PRETTY FULL CAPACITIES OF ALL THIS AND YOU HAVE. FIFTY THOUSAND FOLKS EVACUATED YET FOURTEEN HOME THOUSAND HOMES LOST -- WHERE PEOPLE GO IT'S IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE -- SO IDENTIFIED ANY. ALTERNATIVE -- LOCATIONS WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY OR YOUR SURROUNDING COMMUNITY A LOT OF OUR FOLKS WANT TO STAY WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY WANT TO STAY THERE THEIR KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL THEY'RE INVESTED IN THE COMMUNITY LEVEL LIVING UP THERE THEY HAVE JOBS UP THERE SO. ANYTHING WITHIN THE COMMUTER WILL DISTANCE I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ENTITIES LOOK AT TRY TO IDENTIFY OPTIONS WORK IF YOU HAVE A DISASTER EVEN A SMALLER SCALE WORKING PEOPLE. TEMPORARILY RESIDES HE CAN. KIND OF GET THOSE RELATIONSHIPS IN THOSE MAYBE PUT IN PLACE IN ADVANCE. THE BIG THING I THINK WOULD BE -- AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIS AFTER SITTING DOWN WITH MORE WITH FEMA AND CAL WE **** AND TALK ABOUT LAND USE. RULES REGULATIONS THE POLITICAL CLIMATE THE APTITUDE THIS DISC ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO YEARS PARTICULAR JURISDICTION AS WELL I THINK WOULD GO A LONG WAYS -- AGAIN EVERYONE IS TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A MESS THE THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE IN -- GET WAS ONE THING I THINK WE COULD HAVE DONE A LITTLE BETTER IS SET DOWN WITH EVERYBODY IS ABLE ONE TIME AND IDENTIFY. YOU KNOW JUST WHAT SOME OF THE THE ROAD BLOCKS MIGHT BE WITH WITH REGARDS -- TO HEALTHY OBVIOUS IF YOU COUNTY AGRICULTURE IS A VERY VERY VERY BIG. A COMPONENT OF OUR COMMUNITY AND AND THAT'S IT IT'S REALLY PROTECTED LAND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE WE WOULD WANT TO BUT HOUSING ON AND CERTAINLY THERE'S ENOUGH JEN AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THERE SO IT'S YOU KNOW YOU GOT AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW THESE THINGS WHEN YOU'RE COMING INTO COMMUNITY. OKAY WORK WE PUT UP ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE REPURPOSE HOW'S IT THERE'S THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE JUST UNIQUE TO EACH COMMUNITY -- AND I THINK ALSO EDUCATING YEAR. YOUR GOVERNING BODIES IN YOUR RESIDENCE YOU KNOW WE'VE SIX MONTHS INTO THIS SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED NOT ONLY JUST A TOWN OF PARADISE AND COUNTY IN OR BILL AND ALL THE BIG GREATLY -- CHICO WE HAVE A LOT WE HAVE CHICO HADLEY FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE COME TO THEIR COMMUNITY OVERNIGHT SO. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ABOUT OBVIOUSLY SERVICE LEVELS GO UP THERE'S THERE'S MUCH MORE TRAFFIC -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO LIVE WITH THAT IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE THAT WAY WE WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR OUR SURVIVORS UP THERE AND WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT IT JUST. BUT THERE ARE TRAFFIC ISSUES OR SEWER ISSUES JUST WHEN IT WHEN IT TOWN ABSORBS SO MANY PEOPLE SO QUICKLY THAT YOU HAVE. TO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT -- ANY ZONING ISSUES I THINK IT WOULD RECOMMEND ENTITIES LOOK AT YOU KNOW AGAIN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN -- GET TEMPORARY HOUSING IN YOUR COMMUNITY WE'VE PASSED A NUMBER OF URGENCY ORDINANCES SO IF YOU DO A SOME OF THAT ON A FRIEND AND IT MIGHT HELP YOU. TRY TO MAKE IT UP AS YOU GO AS WE'VE BEEN DOING IT THANKFULLY WE'VE HAD GREAT PARTNERS UNFORTUNATELY FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL. FOR US AND AND AND AND LEARNING FROM THEM BUT I THINK DOING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL -- BEYOND THAT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW AS FAR AS YOU KNOW NEEDS OF OF OF AREAS. THAT ARE SIMILAR TO VIEW COUNTY OR JUST YOU KNOW EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS YOU KNOW WE WE ALL NOWADAYS RELY ON TECHNOLOGY SO MUCH TELEPHONE CELL PHONES INTERNET -- SOME FOLKS ESPECIALLY HER THIS EARLIER IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THEY ARE IN REAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TETHERED TO A CELL PHONE -- SO WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT I THINK EFFORTS IN PROVIDING NUMBERS TO LOCATION SYSTEMS THAT ARE TED TETHERED TO TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF COMMUNITIES NEED TO LOOK AT BEYOND THAT I THINK WE'VE -- WE'VE A LOT OF OTHER LESSONS LEARNED AND WE CONTINUE TO LEARN THROUGH FEMALE YES I THINK AGAIN WE'RE STILL KIND OF IN RESPONSE STAGE FRANKLY WE STILL HAVE OVER FIFTY OR SIXTY FAMILIES AND NINE HUNDRED HOUSING CHILDREN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PLACES FOR THEM TO GO YET. SO -- WE'RE LEARNING AND WE'RE TAKING NOTES AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE OTHER LESSONS LEARNED AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH THE PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR TESTIMONY -- FIRST OF ALL I FEEL LIKE EVERY LIVING WHAT I WENT THROUGH I HAD. FIVE FIVE I'M IN THREE THREE YEARS OF FIRES AND FIVE MY COUNTIES -- AND I STILL HAVE PEOPLE IN LAKE COUNTY AND HOME. AND THERE'S SO MANY PIECES TO THIS IS THE YOU KNOW YOU CAN POINT FINGERS AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED THE FACT THE MATTER IS WE GOT TO GET BETTER AT IT. AND I AT MY ARM I FEEL SO SORRY FOR YOU BECAUSE I'LL NEVER FORGET WHERE I WAS WHEN I GOT THE PHONE CALL FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER WHAT CAN YOU HELP ME DO. EVERYONE I JUST LIVE RELIVED IT NICE TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH THE PEOPLE GONNA COME HELP. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOUR FACES ON THE FRONT OF ALL YOUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW HOW STRONG YOU ARE IN THE YOU'RE WORKING AS A TEAM. AND LUCKILY WE WERE REALLY BLESSED WITH HAVING INCREDIBLE TEAMMATES AS THEY ALSO REGISTRY SERVICES TEAM OF THE CITY'S THE COUNTIES EVERYBODY COMES AND HELPS WHEN YOU NEED IT. BUT THESE THINGS LIKE YOU SAY IS LIKE IT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME IS LIKE WHEN YOU SEE THE TREE REMOVAL -- YEAH THE BEEN THERE DONE THAT WE REALLY WORKED HARD TRYING THINKING AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER TRYING TO THINK OF WAYS WE CAN GET OUR TIMBER OUT THERE. IF IT'S NOT TIMBER WHAT ABOUT THE ACT WASTE SO WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW THE RATE ROSE TO TERRY I SAW ROADS ARE STILL BECAUSE OF ALL THE TRAFFIC THE TRUCK TRAFFIC TO MOVE THAT -- DEBRIS -- HOW DO YOU FIX THAT HOW YOU DOING THE TIMELY MATTER HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU STILL GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BUILD HOMES IN THOSE AREAS AND GET IT IN AND OUT OF A -- MODULAR HOMES MOBILE HOMES TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE YOU GONNA PUT THEM HAVING FEWER WHERE YOU I MEAN ALL THOSE THINGS YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT. AS A COMMON ELECTED OFFICIALS. UNTIL YOU ARE FACED WITH IT AND SO I'VE HAD MY LAKE FIRES OF IN MY CINEMA FIRES I'VE HAD MY NAPA FIRES. I FEEL LIKE I COULD ALMOST HEALTHY YOU KNOW DESIGN A PLAN NOT THAT I WANT -- TO BUT YOU KNOW AND THE OTHER ONE IS IS REALLY HARD TO WEAR THE PEOPLE THE WHERE DID OUR RESIDENTS GO TO LIVE IN THAT AREA I WISH I HAD A DATABASE OF LIKE I SAID AS WHO WAS THERE AND WHERE THEY GO. AND ARE THEY SAFE OR HOW DID THEY DID OR THE LIVING WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS -- ARE THEY LIVING IN CHICO -- ALL THOSE IMPACTS YOU JUST DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT UNTIL YOU ARE FACED WITH THIS TERRIBLE -- EXPERIENCES. SO -- WITH THAT I I HAVE A COMMON I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO MISCARRY SO I GET COME I GET FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE COMING WITH WITH COMPETITION FUNDING. AND I THINK -- MISTER GALLAGHER IS PUTTING IN THE FACE THIS EXACT SAME THING IS BECAUSE SOME. I NEED TO FIND OUT AND I'M GOING TO DO THIS FOR YOU TO FIND OUT WHAT THE ACTUAL -- FORMULA IT IS TO COMPETE. WHAT IS IT THE WHY IS THE WE ARE NOT GETTING? THE OF FUNDING IN SOME OF OUR RURAL AREAS. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE'VE HAD OTHER THINGS ALONG THE WAY THAT I'M. IN WHETHER IT'S EDUCATION HEALTH CARE AND FUNDING AND THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER SOME OF OUR AREAS ARE MORE IN SUBURBAN AREAS. WHEN WE'RE REALLY IN A RURAL AREA COMPETING WITH LARGER COMMUNITIES? SO AND IF I MAY JUST RESPONDED THAT REALLY QUICKLY I WOULD LIKE TO THROW OUT THERE THAT YOLO IS INCREDIBLY PROGRESSIVE IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. WE'VE GOTTEN BACKING FROM ALL FOUR CITY COUNCILS AND THE COUNTY BOARD AND THE A TO DO HE WENT TO NATION. TO GO AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ACCREDITATION BEEN WORKING TOWARDS IT FOR FIVE YEARS. SO THE FACT THAT IT'S HARD FOR US. JUST REALLY KIND OF SETS THAT STAGE THAT WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS THERE'S A LOT OF SMALLER COUNTIES THAT WE HELP AND ADVISE WE SENT. A NUMBER OF YEARS HE PERSONNEL UP TO THE PARADISE YOU SEE DURING THE THANKSGIVING WEEKEND AND EVERYTHING. AND THEY'RE NOT AT THE SAME LEVEL WHERE AT AND THEY FACE THE SAME CHALLENGE RIGHT SO -- THERE'S SO MUCH THIS HERE IN THE ALL THE TESTAMENT TO THEY IS JUST BEEN -- OPENS UP A WOUND THAT I FEEL LIKE I STILL HAVE FROM ALL THE FIRES -- THE LABOR ISSUES. FROM DAY. ONE WE HAD PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO BUILD HOMES IN LAKE COUNTY AND AFTER THE FIRES WENT THROUGH IN -- SANTA ROSA. THEY LEFT THE AREA LAKE COUNTY AND WENT TO WHERE THEY GET TO DO MORE WORK IN A SHORTER PERIOD TIME UNLIKE IN AND THE INSPECTORS AMID THE IT HAVING INSPECTORS AND HAVING -- YOU KNOW STAFF TO ABLE TO HELP OUT. EVERY COUNTY NEEDS. AND THE COLLECTED THE THANK YOU EARLIER SO LET ME CORRECT THAT RIGHT NOW FOR YOUR HELP IN. IN A TERRITORY THAT WE WORK IN IT IS THE BIG ISSUE WELL IF WE HAD ENOUGH WORKERS WE COULD WITH THE PERMITS BEING ISSUE WE COULD MOVE THIS ALONG MUCH FASTER -- WHAT HAS SLOWED MOST OF THE RESIDENTS HAVE THE INSURANCE ISSUES YES VOTES FOR THE TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE IN THE NORTH THEY WERE UNDER INSURED EITHER MODERATELY OR SERIOUSLY? YOU'VE HEARD THAT STORY BEFORE BUT THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENTS NOW PEOPLE ARE COMPANY CONTRACTORS ARE POACHING OFF EACH OTHER'S WORKERS AND I HATE TO SEE THAT BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO BE OF BUILDING COMMUNITY. BUT IT'S HARD WHEN SOMEBODY'S TAKING YOUR EMPLOYEES AND THE THERE ON A FRIDAY AND THEY DON'T SHOW UP ON A MONDAY THAT'S MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT SO ANY HELP WE CAN GET ON SUPPORT. FOR PROGRAMS ALL BETTER YEAH WE HAD I AM CONTRACTORS FROM THE SACRAMENTO AREA DRIVING TO SANTA ROSA EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH. A WHOLE BAND FULL OF EMPLOYEES TO GROUNDWORK GO BACK AND FORTH SO. I'M WITHOUT WITH ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER RELIGIOUS YOU KNOW THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR -- YOU KNOW NOT ONLY FOR THIS HEARING BUT ALSO -- YOU KNOW AS YOU WERE TALKING AYE I REMEMBER GETTING THAT CALL ONE I REMEMBER TALKING TO YOU LAST YEAR YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING GOING ON IN YOUR DISTRICT. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO PUT YOURSELF IN THAT PLACE INTO YOU'VE GONE THROUGH IT RIGHT AND AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW -- LAST YEAR WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE WE DEALT WITH AND TRYING TO FIND. YOU KNOW. RESOURCES AND POLICY SOLUTIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE OF THE FIRES IN YOUR YOUR DISTRICT. I NEVER WOULD'VE IMAGINED THAT. YEAH I'D BE FACING THE SAME THING AND SO I'M AND YOU WERE YOU WERE ONE OF THE FIRST TO CALL ME WHEN -- WHEN THE CAMPFIRE -- OCCURRED IN AND ALL THOSE THINGS AND GIVEN ME I STILL HAVE MY NOTES -- OF THINGS THAT TO HE SAID HEY HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO BE READY -- FOR AND IT'S IT'S UNFORTUNATE -- AND YET. THE FACT THAT YOU WENT THROUGH THAT AND THAT YOU GUYS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES HAVE KIND OF DEVELOPED. IN A WAY -- A TEMPLATE FOR HOW YOU CAN YOU KNOW COME BACK AND HOW YOU CAN START PLANNING FOR THESE THINGS IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD AND AND BRIAN HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW RUNNING OUR ORDERS ARE JOINT TASK FORCE THE UNITED I BELIEVE THE TEMPLE WAS KINDA STARTED IN IN CINEMA -- BUT YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL RESOURCES ARE TRYING TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WORK TOGETHER AND THAT'S BEEN A NO. YOU KNOW. SOMETIMES JEAN YOU KNOW AND BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY WORKED REALLY WELL TOGETHER I THINK. IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS. TWO THINGS I JUST KNOW THAT WE KIND OF BROUGHT UP. YOU KNOW FEMA HAS A TEN YOU KNOW HAS THEIR WAY OF DOING THINGS IN TERMS OF INTERIM HOUSING. AND YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S SOME IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED OVER TIME BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS THEY LOOK. TO BRING IN TEMPORARY INTERIM HOUSING LIKE MOBILE MH USE AND TRAILERS THEY WANT TO FIND SITES THAT ALREADY HAVE SEWER AND WATER. AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THEM YOU KNOW AND AND THEN.
