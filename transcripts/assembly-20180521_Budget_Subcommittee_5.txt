JANITORIAL PROPOSAL OKAY WE'RE GOING TO I THINK WE HAVE A PANEL OF INDIVIDUALS. THE JANET OF THE AGENDA ARE PROPOSED REQUESTED AID NET AUGMENTATION OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHICH INCLUDES A REDUCTION. OF TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXISTING PRIDE CONTRACT AND AN INCREASE OF THIRTEEN POINT ONE. MILLION FOR CIVIL SERVICE STAFF TO TAKE OVER THE GENITAL SERVICES THIS ASSUMES A RAMP UP IN HIRING OVER THE COURSE. THE MAY REVISION ADJUSTMENTS CONTAINS TWO COMPONENTS FIRST THERE IS A REQUEST FOR EIGHT MILLION. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO RESTORE PARTIAL YOUR FUNDING FOR THE PRIDE CONTRACT. THE PLAN IS FOR THE CONTRACT TO BE RAMPED UP OVER THE COURSE OF THE BUDGET YEAR AS WE HIGHER CIVIL SERVICE STAFF. HOWEVER IN JANUARY THE CONTRACT WAS INADVERTENTLY ZERO OUT COMPLETELY THIS FUNDING WOULD SIMPLY RESTORE THAT PARTIAL YOUR PHASE OUT. FINALLY THE MAY REVISION ADJUSTMENTS REALIZE THAT CUT THE AUTHORITY FOR CONTRACTING WITH PI EIGHT UNCLE TO OVERSEE THE GENITAL SERVICES AND CCR TO CORRECTIONAL HEALTH. CARE SERVICES. WE HAVE WITH US AS HE AYE YOU ACTUALLY MARTINEZ PRIDE DON NELSON. A DISABILITY RIGHTS. CURTIS CHILD IN CDC ARE THE RECEIVER. THEY WILL COME FORWARD. OKAY INTRODUCED. OKAY OKAY WE CAN BEGIN WITH ASHLEY MARTINEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ACTUALLY MARTINEZ HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION LOCAL ONE THOUSAND. WE REPRESENT OVER NINETY SIX THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES INCLUDING THE STATE'S CUSTODIANS AND WE ARE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE PLAN TO TRANSITION THE WORKERS CURRENTLY UNDER THE PRIDE CONTRACT BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AFTER THE DEPARTMENT FOUND THAT THEY WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION ONE NINE ONE THREE ZERO. OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE WHICH LAYS OUT WHEN A DEPARTMENT OR STATE AGENCY CAN ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR PERSONAL SERVICES. IN ORDER TO BECOME CLIP COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW THE DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHED THE TRANSITION PLAN WHICH IS LAID TO MOVE ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES AND THE STATE CIVIL SERVICE WHERE THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE COMPARABLE SALARIES. FULL HEALTH BENEFITS AND A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FROM THE STATE. AS NOTED BY THE RECEIVER AT LAST WEEK'S HEARING AND. THOUGH PROBABLY TALK ABOUT IT TODAY. WORK CURRENTLY IN YEAR TWO OF THAT TRANSITION. AND IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT TRANSITION HAS ALREADY BEGUN. LOCAL ONE THOUSAND IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT NO WORKERS DISPLACED DURING THIS TRANSITION. I WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE FAILURE TO APPROVE THIS PLAN AS PROPOSED COULD POTENTIALLY DISRUPT THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE FACILITY. THEN PUT THE TRANSITION OF THE EMPLOYEES AT RISK AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR IN THE BEST INTERESTS. OF THE WORKERS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE THE DEPARTMENT AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THIS. TRANSITION IS SUCCESSFUL AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. STUDENT ALSO. HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DON NELSON VICE PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS FOR PRIDE INDUSTRIES. PRIZE A NONPROFIT COMPANY. FOUNDED IN THE BASEMENT CHURCH IN AUBURN IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX IN OUR MISSION IS TO EMPLOY PEOPLE DISABILITIES. AND WE START OUT THE. STOCKTON PRISON CONTRACT AND HAVE WORKED OUR WORK FORCE TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NOT EMPLOYEES WITH DISABILITIES. THE ON THAT PROJECT WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED. INSTITUTION THROUGH AN OFF OF IT OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL INSPECTION. ACA AUDIT AND ALSO A JACO AUDIT AND THE STATE AUDITOR'S AUDIT TO TO RETURN THE FACILITY BACK TO A HOSPITAL HEALTHCARE STANDARDS. OF WHICH IT WASN'T PERFORMING PRIOR. NOT OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE GONNA R. EMPLOYS A DISABILITIES WILL NOT HAVE THE SUPPORTS. IN THE SYSTEMS IN A STRUCTURED THAT WE PROVIDE. UNDER OUR PRIDE INDUSTRIES A TO PERFORM THE WORK. IF THE TRANSITION OVER STATE CIVIL SERVICE ON POSITIONS. OKAY. ANYONE ELSE CURTIS CHILD. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CARE CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND THAT INCLUDES. FOR INCREASING MORE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. LET ME JUST SAY AT THE OUTSET ON ON THIS PROPOSAL. WE ARE WE ARE OPPOSED BUT. WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON WHETHER. THIS. IS THE EMPLOYMENT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IS THROUGH A CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYMENT OR IS AND CONTINUED DUH WITH THE CONTRACT WITH. WITH PRIDE WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS ASSURING THAT THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. CURRENTLY EMPLOYED DE IN THESE POSITIONS BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. THOSE. POSITIONS AND AND THERE IT SPENT DISCUSSION ABOUT POTENTIAL WAYS OF OF DOING THAT WHICH IS INCLUDED DUH THE LISTS AND THE LEAP PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT WILL INDEED ASSURE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ABLE TO. KEEP THEIR EMPLOYMENT AND AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO CDC ARE. AND GOING BACK AND LOOKING AT THEIR NUMBERS ON THE. THEIR EMPLOYMENT OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES SPENT QUITE DISAPPOINTING. IN IN THE PAST AND PARTICULARLY USING THE ONLY PROGRAM TO. TO GET TO THAT EMPLOYMENT. WHAT WE WOULD ASK? IS THE COMMITTEE LOOKED TO. DOING IS ASSURING THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME IF YOU MOVE FORWARD. WITH. WITH THE. BCP IS TO ASSURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE THAT WOULD SURE THESE INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT A CAP CAN KEEP THEIR EMPLOYMENT SHOULD THEY SO DESIRE. AS. CIVIL SERVICE. IF THERE IF THERE IS A DESIRE TO GO IN THE DIRECTION OF RETAINING THE CONTRACT THEN I THINK THAT ISSUE DOESN'T. PRESENT ITSELF BUT EITHER WAY. I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO SEE ON A LANGUAGE THAT TO THATWOULD ENSURE THEIR CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE OTHER PIECE THAT I THINK IS CRITICAL JUST TWO YEARS AGO. WE HAD FINISHED UP WITH WITH THE. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND DDS AND AND DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION A BLUEPRINT FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF. PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND WITH A CALL IN A DESIGN FOR CALIFORNIA AND INCREASING COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND WE THINK THIS WOULD GO IN THAT DIRECTION THE CONTRARY TO THAT THANK YOU. SO IT THE RECEIVER SEE OUR BUSINESS SEAT. YEAH. PUTTING HIM UNDER MINEAR ON THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE POLICY IN ADMIN FOURTH RECEIVERS DID. FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE TRANSITION PLAN OF PRIDE THE IMP IN PRY CONTRACT TO CIVIL SERVICE. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION ONE I WANT THE RIO TELLS ME THAT I NEED TO HIRE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES. WHEN WE MADE THE DECISION WHEN THE DECISION WAS MADE THAT WE NEEDED TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR JANUARY OR SO WE'VE BEEN DOING LOT OF ACTIVITY TO TRY TO. ASSIST THE PRIDE EMPLOYEES IN A CURRENT OBTAINING OF THE ABILITY TO GET ON THE CERTIFICATION LIST SO THAT WE CAN THEN TURN THEM INTO CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES. I DON'T KNOW OF ANOTHER WAY THAT I CAN GET THEM TO BECOME CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS. OUT OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX CUSTODIANS THAT THEY HAVE WE'VE GOTTEN NINETY ON THIS. THE CERTAIN LIST SO THAT'S FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF THEIR EMPLOYEES IS ON THE LIST. WE HAVE A PHASED ROLLOUT OF FOR THE POSITIONS SO JANUARY THEIR POSITIONS THAT COME ON IT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN THOSE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN FIELD ONE THIS WITH. A PRIDE EMPLOYEE. WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY SEVEN TO FORTY EIGHT POSITIONS THAT COME ON IN SEPTEMBER. I THINK IT'S NOVEMBER DECEMBER IT'S LIKE FORWARD. FOR THREE THREE ADDITIONAL PRAISE THAT SINCE ABOUT FORTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT POSITIONS WITH THAT MANY PRIDE EMPLOYEES ON THE LIST. THE HOPE IS THAT SOME OF THOSE PRIDE EMPLOYEES GET PICKED UP TO BE CALM CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES. AND SO THE THAT. PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT THEY WANT ME TO DO SOMETHING THAT I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO I HAVE TO GO WITH CIVIL SERVANTS THAT'S WHAT. THEY WANT THEY ASK. WHEN I SAY THEY ITS PRIDE OKAY OKAY. IN THE DISABILITY VITAMIN. THAT'S WHO I'M SPEAKING ABOUT BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO WITH THAT I HAVE TO GO WITH THE PROCESS IN THE PROCESS FILLS ME I HAVE TO GO THROUGH CIVIL SERVICE. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WE HELD EVENTS AT THE CH C. F. SPECIFICALLY WE TOOK COMPUTERS THEY ARE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF CAMPAIGNS. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET. THEIR EMPLOYEES ON THE CERTIFICATION LIST BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR PATH TO BECOMING CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES. AND WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL EVENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN HOLDING UP AS A CONSEQUENCE WE GOT A LOT OF CANDIDATES ON THE LIST SO WE'VE YOU KNOW PUT SOME ATTENTION AND SOME FOCUS ON IT. WITH THAT RECRUITMENT EFFORT AND SO THEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM I'M DOING WHAT I THEY'RE DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET THEM ON THE LIST TO GET THEM A PATH. TO BECOME CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES AND I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF ANY OTHER THING THAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST THEM. EXCEPT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND LIKE I SAY WE'VE GOT LIKE NINETY ARE ALMOST FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF THEIR. STAFF ON THE CERTIFICATION LIST. SO YOU'VE YOU'VE BEEN. SO SEWING IT I THINK THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO A WHAT WAS GOING ON SO ONE MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS AND PRIDE THAT ARE. CURRENTLY IN THE KNOW. WORKING IN THE FACILITY HOW MANY OTHER. THE FACILITY I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN OR SO READ ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN EMPLOYEES THERE. CURRENTLY A OF THAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES PERFORMING ON THAT PROJECT ALSO YET SO OUT OF THE TWO SEVENTY THAT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO SEVENTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SKIS ME. AND. AND HUNDRED AND TWENTY ARE. BASICALLY PRIDE EMPLOYEES THERE OUGHT LAW THE ALL TOO SEVENTEEN ARE PRIDE EMPLOYEES OKAY OF THAT TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR EMPLOYEES WITH DISABILITIES OKAY OKAY SO THAT ARE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES DISABILITIES ABOVE AND BEYOND EIGHTY A OKAY SO. WHERE ACCOMMODATIONS ARE MADE THAT ARE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT EIGHTY EIGHT FIRES RIGHT? SO WE PROVIDE COUNSELING AND SUPPORTS NAM DAY MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL ON THE JOB OKAY AND YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO CERTIFY HOW MANY OF THEM. WHAT WHAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IS THAT THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX? IN THE CUSTODIAN SERIES RIGHT AND. OUT OF THOSE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX WE'VE GOT NINETY PEOPLE ON THE CERTIFICATION WILL IT. SUB THAT'S ABOUT FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL CUSTODIANS THAT THEY HAD MOVED TO I'M NOT CLEAR ABOUT HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE WERE THE ONES THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT TWENTY ONE THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT OR IF THE ONE TWENTY ONE THAT HE'S SPEAKING THAT IS ALL CUSTODIAN CLASSIFICATIONS BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS THERE SO I'M NOT CLEAR ABOUT THAT HERE THAT ONE TWENTY FALLS WITHIN A COUPLE CLASSIFICATIONS BUT. ABOVE ALL OF OUR WORKFORCE OUT THERE. TO ONE TWENTY OUR EMPLOYEES A DISABILITIES WHETHER THEY'RE CUSTODIANS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE TECHNICIANS OR FLOOR TECHNICIANS. IN IN UPPER LEVEL POSITIONS. IF THEY MOVED UP AND IN BEEN PROMOTED. SO IN THIS IN THIS ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE FOR THIS TRANSITION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS I MEAN BECAUSE YOU GOT ALL THESE DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS AND AND YOU'RE MAKING A IF YOU'RE MAKING THE CHANGE TO? TO MOVE THEM INTO I GUESS INTO TO CIVIL SERVICE IF YOU CAN. I'M NOT MAKING THE CHANGE TO MOVE THEM INTO CIVIL SERVICE WHAT I'M DOING IS GOING TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET ON. THE CERTIFICATION LIST SO THAT THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME CIVIL SERVANT ANGLO OKAY YEAH HOW DOES AND WHAT IS REQUIRED ON THAT IS THERE TESTING YES RAINY HOPE THERE'S A TEST PROCESS THAT DIDN'T PROCESS. AND WHAT WE DID IS WE HELD RECRUITMENT EVENTS WHERE WE. SET UP COMPUTERS FOR THEM AND IF I DIDN'T THEM WITH LOGGING INTO THE SYSTEM TO DO THE APPLICATION AND TO GET THE A. TO GAVE THE ABILITY TO GET ON THE CERTIFICATION LIMITS AND WE DON'T AN ACCORD IT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY. OF YOUR MEMBERS ARE DISABLED THAT ARE ON THAT ARE CUSTODIANS WE DON'T KNOW THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF OUR DISABLED OF THE ONE TWENTY I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS TO APPLY I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS ON THAT ARE. YOU KNOW WE WERE NOT TRACKING YOU KNOW WHO'S DOING APPLICATIONS AND HAS NOT. TO DO YOU HAVE NO MEMORY DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL I DO NOT KNOW YES. AND THIS THIS TRANSITION IS TO CURE OCCUR WHEN. JULY FIRES OH. OKAY YES MA'AM THIS IS THE LAST YEAR OF THE DELIVERY YEAR TRANSITION. THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING. FOR SOMETIME OKAY WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME SO MOST OF THE TRANSITION HAS OCCUR. WHEN WE SAY THAT NOW AND FOR THE TRANSITION PRIDE IS DOING THE SERVICE. UP UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH% JUNE THIRTIETH. SEVEN ONE THERE IS A PHASED IN APPROACH TO TRANSITIONING PRIDE OUT OF PROVIDING THE SERVICES AND CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES PROVIDING THE SERVICES. SO EFFECTIVE. JULY FIRST THERE'S ABOUT FOURTEEN POSITIONS THAT COME ALIVE WE'VE ALREADY DONE THAT. INTERVIEW PROCESS WE'VE GOT COMMITMENTS. INDIVIDUALS TO COME ON JULY FIRES THE NETS ROLLOUT PHASE IT'S SEPTEMBER OKAY THIS YEAR SO SLOWLY BUT SURELY YOU'RE BASICALLY REPLACING THEM WITH CIVIL SERVICE YES OKAY. AND. AND EVERYONE I ASSUME IS APPLYING FOR THOSE POSITIONS AT NO FOLKS THAT. WE'RE JUST MOVING AND EVERYONE IS APPLYING FOR ONE OF THE POSITIONS THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT WE'RE HAVING CONDUCTING INTERVIEW PROCESS GOING THROUGH THE INTERVIEW PROCESS COMPETITIVE PROCESS. CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS TO FILL THOSE VACANCIES. OKAY. I ASSUME IT IT IS A LITTLE I'M NOT SO I GUESS THE CONCERN IS THAT WE WERE MOVING A NUMBER OF DISABLED INDIVIDUALS OUT OF THOSE POSITIONS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BUT THAT WAS A CONCERN. AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S. THAT THAT HAS TO OCCUR A LEASE THE TRANSITION TO CIVIL SERVICE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY. PROGRAM THAT WOULD BASICALLY ALLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS TO CONTINUE TO WORK. BUT. THE ONE OF THE. PROBLEM TO ME BECOMES THIS THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO GRANDFATHER THEM FROM CONTRACT EMPLOYEES INTO CIVIL SERVANT OKAY THERE'S NO MECHANISM THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT TRANSITIONS THEM FROM A CONTRACT EMPLOYEE TO CIVIL SERVICE AND. THEY HAVE TO COMPETE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES THE GAY CIVIL SERVICE STATUS IT'S A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. THERE IS A LEAP EXAMINATION LIMITED. EXAMINATION APPOINTMENT PROCESS YOU'RE PROBABLY IT WHERE IT DIDN'T AND WE DID ESTABLISH A. OF. EXAM FOR THE CUSTODIANS WITH THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY MONICA TO IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE SAFETY DESIGNATION THAT COMES WITH IT WHEN I ASKED MY STAFF TO LOOK AT THAT LIST IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE. THERE'S ABOUT TWELVE. TWELVE UPRIGHTS PEOPLE ON THE LEAP FROM THIS BUT THEIR OWN BELIEF LIST THAT'S NON CF SO I ASKED THEM TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE TO GET ON THE ONE WITH THE CF DESIGNATION IN ORDER TO WORK FOR US BECAUSE. THAT IS THE LEAD LISTS WE WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT A SEA OF DESIGNATION IT'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. AT THE SITE AT THE FOUR REQUIREMENTS OKAY I'M GOING HOME. DID YOU HAVE THEM MADAM CHAIR IF I MIGHT. JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS I THINK THAT TED NOT TO TO COMPLICATE THIS BUT. CERTAINLY THE OFFER OF A PLACE ON THE LIST DOES NOT ASSURE THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL WILL BE ABLE TO BE EMPLOYED. EITHER THROUGH LEAP OR OTHERWISE AND AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT THE LIST HAS. THOSE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR THIS JOB THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALS WHO. CURRENTLY ARE EMPLOYED IN THE POSITION WHERE F.. WITH PRIDE RIGHT NOW. SO THERE IS. I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT CHANCE AND AGAIN LOOKING A BIT TO HISTORY THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ALL GOING TO BE PICKED UP OR EVEN IF THEY DO THEY MAY THERE MAY BE SOME SIGNIFICANT GAP. IN BETWEEN THE. DATE OF TERMINATION AND AND IF THEY MAKE THEIR WAY. UP ON THE LIST THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT WHAT PRIDE PROVIDES. FOR MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS AS JOB COACHING AND SO THERE'S AT LEAST THREE I THINK POSITIONS FOR. JOB COACHES. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR ISN'T SUCH A. A. CLASSIFICATION FOR A POSITION THERE SO INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE IN NEED OF JOB COACHING TO COMPLETE THEIR. JOBS WOULD NOT BE AND BE ABLE TO. BE. EMPLOYED IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT SO SUPPORTS THAT HELPS THEM. GETTING TO WORK IF THERE ARE PUSH CERTAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE JOB. PRIDE CAN CERTAINLY SPEAK BETTER THAN I BUT BUT THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF FUNCTION. THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOW PROVIDING TO KEEP THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EMPLOYED. THAT YOU WOULD LOSE AND I THINK. THEY WOULD NOT AT ALL HAVETHE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH LIST OR OTHERWISE TO CONTINUE THAT. THEIR EMPLOYMENT I THINK THESE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED OVER SIX MONTHS. FOR THE POSITION THEY'RE WELL TRAINED THEY'RE QUALIFIED THEY'RE DOING THE JOB. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE VIETNAM. WE WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN PARTICULARLY FOR THIS GROUP THAT IS NOW WORKING WITHIN. THE FACILITIES TO KEEP THEM EMPLOYED. YOU HAVE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE OF THE TESTIMONY IN THE AUDIENCE. THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL. IS THE TURN IT OFF ALRIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. WHERE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE OF THIS PROPOSAL AT ONE ADELINE MACINNES OF THOSE SERVICE YEAH YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS IS? THE FINAL STAGE OF A TRANSITION PLAN THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SKINNER. CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS WHERE THEY'LL HAVE. SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER BENEFITS WOULD HAVE A PENSION WHERE THEY HAVE CONFERENCE. HERE WE BELIEVE THAT. THE STEEP REALLY PROGRAM AND OTHER INITIATIVES CAN A USE THOSE TOOLS TO BUY EIGHTEEN TO WORK IN A MITIGATING ANY ISSUES WITH A TRANSITION WORKERS OVER ITS OF THE PARTICULARLY WORKERS WITH WITH DISABILITIES AND ALSO. AS OUR POSITION THAT WE BELIEVE THAT BILLIARDS WERE FIELDING TO PROVIDE THE FUNDS TO COMPLETE THE TRANSITION WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE ENSIGNS IT CONSEQUENCES BUT WORKERS IN THE FACILITIES OF SOME. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME VERSION OF WHAT I THINK YOU I THINK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS WERE NAY BAYARDO SLU CALIFORNIA WE ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE LABOR FED. HOME IN SUPPORT OF THE PCB. THANK YOU OR ANYONE. THE POST THE PROPOSAL. VENTURE MEMBERS BOB JEREMY HAVE THE NATIONAL UNION HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND. I THINK EVERYBODY HERE IN THE COMMITTEE KINDA DANCED AROUND THE ISSUE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADULTS AND HAVE FUNCTIONING AUTISM. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADULTS THAT HAVE DOWN SYNDROME WE'RE TALKING BASICALLY THE ONLY REASON THAT THE RECEIVER SAID THAT'S CORRECT THEIR FIFTY ONE PEOPLE OF THE WORK OR FIFTY ONE PERCENT. HAS BEEN ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE LIST THE REST OF THEM CAN'T PASS THE TEST MADAM CHAIR AND THAT'S THE ISSUE. THAT'S THAT'S WHO THEY WANT TO PUT OUT OF WORK OR PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED WHO HAVE JOBS THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE WORKING THAT CAN'T PASS THE CIVIL SERVICE EXAM. AND THAT'S WHAT THE. THAT'S WHAT THE RECEIVER IS IMPLYING SHE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF. SHE CAN'T MAKE A TEST THAT THEY CAN PASS SO THAT'S THE ISSUE. WHO? YEAH. MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS.

I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT STUPID PLAY WITH A DISABILITY WAS I DON'T START MAY BE FISCAL WHATEVER WAS BUT. OUR EMPLOYEES ARE CAPABLE. PEOPLE DOING WHAT THEY CAN AND DATE ARE VERY BRIGHT. I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE SUPPORTED WITH THIS TRANSITION. WITH ALL THE SUPPORT THAT WE PROVIDE FOR ARM ARE PLEASE WITH DISABILITIES. SO I EMPLOYEE GOSTOSA PLEASE THINK ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. DOCTOR WEBER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. RECALLING TRIPS SENDING ARCA DISSOCIATION REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES THAT WE'RE HERE I IN SUPPORT OF THE EFFORTS OF PRIVATE INDUSTRIES. AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE. EMPLOYMENT OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. HIS IS A ABYSMAL ON WE HAD ON OUR NEVER NEVER A. REACHING CLOSE TO OUR GOALS OF. TRYING TO US SUPPORT HIM TO KEEP UP PEOPLE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES EMPLOYED OF THIS IS A STEP BACKWARDS AND AGAIN WE SUPPORT. OUR ARE GOOD PROVIDER AT TO ALTER REGIONAL CENTER UPRIGHT INDUSTRIES THANK YOU THANK YOU. THEY COME IT'S A QUESTION FOR THOSE HERE DANCE LACKEY. YEAH. I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT SO I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS AN INTENTIONAL ATTACK AGAINST PRIDE INDUSTRIES BUT IT IS THAT. WE HAVE. IT'S VERY REGRETTABLE WHAT'S BEING CONSIDERED. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF. PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROVEN TO BE. PRODUCTIVE. AND CAPABLE. AND BECAUSE OF A POLITICAL. TAKEOVER. THEY'RE GOING TO BE UNEMPLOYED. AND REALLY NOT COMPETITIVE. IN ANY OTHER ATMOSPHERE. AND I JUST THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE. UNSAVORY TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE POLICYMAKERS. AS A A PERSON WHO. BELIEVES VERY STRONGLY IN ADVOCATING FOR THOSE WHO CAN ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES. WE HAVE KNOW GREATER CALLING AS PUBLIC SERVANTS. TO STAND IN DEFENCE. AND A FIGHT FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T FIND FOR THEMSELVES AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE HERE. AND SO I HOPE WE CAN COME TO A REASONABLE SOLUTION I THINK THAT. THERE IS A WAY TO SYNTHESIZE. LABOR. AND THESE THESE UNIQUE WORKERS. AND IF WE CAN'T DO THAT SHAME ON US. ANYONE ELSE. MISTER JONES SAWYER. ARM. YOU KNOW I HAVE A. THIS IS. I'M UNIQUELY QUALIFIED LOT OF WAYS. TO SPEAK HONEST. ON ONE. S. FORMER SEIU THREE FORTY SEVEN MEMBER BEFORE BECAME SEVEN TWO ONE WE UNDERTOOK. BOMB AND ANALYSIS A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WOULD. THEN REPUBLICAN MAYOR RICHARD RIORDAN TO SEE WHETHER NOT CONTRACTING OUT WAS BETTER THAN USING INSIDE. INDIVIDUALS ONE YOU COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES. GOVERNMENT PLOYS OUTSHINED ON PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES. EVERY TIME IN EVERY SECTOR. AS AN A MAIN REASON FOR IT. COINCIDENTLY FOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE. AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING YOU'RE PROUD TO BE A CITY EMPLOYEE TO PROUD. TO GET A PENSION PROUD TO GO TO WORK EVERYDAY AND SO THEY WORK EXTRA HARD. IN A LOT OF OUR BUILDINGS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE CLEAN SENATOR IN SAFE. AND AND SO AS WE WENT THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE'RE ABLE TO PROVE. TO THAT. THAT MAYOR WHO WANTED TO CONTRACT EVERYTHING OUT. THAT SEIU. EMPLOYEES MOSTLY CONSULTANT. WHERE THE BEST CHOICE AS FAR AS? CONTRACTING. THIS SECOND PARTS A LITTLE MORE. AND I WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU. WITH THAT BECAUSE WE ALSO TRANSITION I'VE INVOLVING TRANSITIONING. I'M FROM PRIVATE SECTOR CUSTODIAL. A CONTRACT AND BRANCHING OUT TO MORE PUBLIC SECTOR SO HAD THAT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL CIVILLY. EXPERIENCE AND IF I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. TOO MUCH WHICH IS PROBABLY. CLOSER TO MY HEART ITEM. AND I'VE SAID A COUPLE TIMES. I WAS YOUNG. HE WAS TOLD FOR THAT WE COULD BRING HIS SAN AYE DOG. TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DID NOT A COMEDY THAT. OH MY BROTHER BEING. A LITTLE REBELLIOUS SET FROM THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE UNTIL DEPRESSION EVERYBODY CAME. AND NOW IN DC SCHOOL SYSTEM BAILOUT. YOU TO BRING YOUR SYNAGOGUE. BUT WE HAD TO PUSH IT. WE HAD A PUSHY WHEN HE WASN'T. MIDDLE SCHOOL WITH THE PUSH ACCOMMODATIONS FOR HIM FOR BRAILLE WHEN HE WASN'T. IN HIGH SCHOOL TO DO DO IT WHEN HE WAS IN COLLEGE. AND EVEN TODAY MY BROTHER WHO'S DOCTOR FREDRIC CLIFFORD JONES. WHO THE VICE PRINCIPAL AND THE DC SCHOOL DISTRICT? SOMETIMES COME TO WORK LATE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE BUS. OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T DRIVE. AND BEFORE UBER AND LEFT HE WOULD TAKE THE BUS ANY WILL GET WRITTEN UP SOMETIME FOR BEING LATE BECAUSE BUSES ARE ALWAYS ON TIME. ANY COULD STAY LATE. SO HE'D AGAIN PUT HIS FOOT DOWN AND MADE TO DC SCHOOLS. DISTRICT. ACCOMMODATE HIM. SO THE HE'D BE ABLE TO TO DO ITS WORK. I THINK. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. IS THE SAME THING THAT I'VE SEEN ALL ALONG MY BROTHER'S LIFE THAT. WE WANNA HELP BUT I HANDS MIGHT BE TIED. AND IF IT IF IT TAKES. AND I KNOW AT THE END OF OUR. SESSION AND BUILD WITH IT TAKES A BILL. TO GIVE YOU THE FLEXIBILITY. TO BE ABLE TO BRING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND TO THE SYSTEM. SO THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN DO THE WORK ESPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO ALREADY. AND TO BRING THE MEN. I AM MORE WILLING. TO WORK WITH A GOOD DEPARTMENT. OR WITH ANYONE UMP TO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IT IS DEFINITELY NOT EASY BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THE SYSTEM IS A ROBUST ENOUGH RIGHT NOW. TUTOR TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT BE EXAMPLES ALREADY A SOUND LIKE PRIDE IS ALREADY WORKED ON THAT. OF HOW WE CAN. WE COULDN'T IT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT. AND ALSO. MAKE SURE THEY'RE AT LEAST UP TO A CERTAIN PROFICIENCY. WITH ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND HELP ON BUT THAT'S. MISTER LACKEY SAID THAT'S KINDA ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN. IN THAT WHAT WE TRY TO TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR DO ALL THE TIME. SHOULDN'T WE. BE DOING THAT TOO AND SHOULDN'T WE. AND I SAY WE JUST APPEAR LAWMAKERS AND ADMINISTRATORS. WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY. THAT WE CAN BRING IN AS MANY AS POSSIBLE ON KNOCKED ST IT IS POSSIBLY YOU KNOW ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BUT WE SHOULD. COME UP WITH THE PLAN EARLY% SEPARATE DISCUSSION WITH THEM. AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT INDIVIDUALS WHO DO THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND EXCITING HERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW. WE CAN WORK WITH EXPERTS ON THIS ON SO THAT WE CAN BRING IT IS IN MANY. POSSIBLE. BUT MOST IMPORTANT. AND I I KNOW WE ALREADY HAVE A A BUDGET FOR THIS. BUT IF WE EVER GONNA COMEDY AND WE BELIEVE IN IT. IF WE NEED TO INCREASED THIS BUDGET SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE. INDIVIDUALS LET'S DO THAT ABOUT THE DISHES A GREAT IDEA A GREAT IDEA AND THAT NOT ONLY DO YOU. YOU GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE. BUT YOU'RE INCORPORATING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHICH I HAVEN'T SEEN. AND THE GOVERNMENT OF A LOT AND SO I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. TO BE THE BOILERPLATE BUT TO BE THE STANDARD BEARER OF HOW. WE BLEND BOTH WHAT ARE CIVIL SERVICE RULES AND REGULATIONS AND AND I DON'T AND I WOULD LOVE TO SIT WITH YOU AND. I'VE TAKEN MORE CIVIL SERVICE TEST LAW ALLOWS WHY I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THEM. FARE FAMILIAR CIVIL SERVICE RULES AND REGULATIONS. I'M BUT I ALSO KNOW ABOUT ACCOMMODATION. BECAUSE I HAD TO MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS AND. OVER NINE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE CITY FACILITIES. HOME WHAT THE. WITH A STAFF OF ABOUT. ON OVER A THOUSAND AND NOT ALL OF THEM. WE'RE FULLY ABLE. AND WE WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE IN THE CITY OF LA. WASN'T EASY. BUT SINCE WE WANTED TO DO IT. WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO ON. BOTH FRONTS AS FAR AS. MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE BEST QUALIFIED CIVIL SERVANTS WORKING AND DOING A GREAT JOB. TAKING OVER THOSE POSITIONS BUT ALSO HOW DO WE. SERIOUSLY SIT DOWN A TRANSITION INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGE IN GETTING THERE. MADAM CHAIR MARVIN PINNELL WITH CAPITA STRATEGIES GROUP HERE WHAT PRIDE IF I MAY HAVE JUST A MINUTE TO ANSWER MISTER GREG JONES SAWYER. I SHE JUST FOR CLARIFICATION SURPRISED IS THE NONPROFIT AND WE DO EMPLOY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE HAVE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH. US W. W. I WOULD WITH OPERATING ENGINEERS AND WHAT. ANOTHER UNION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO. WE HAVE OVER ONE THOUSAND OF OUR OF OUR WORKERS THAT ARE FAVOR SO WE WE SUPPORT LABOR I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT AND PUT THAT ON THE RECORD. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE DO WANT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THE WORKERS ARE PROTECTED I HAD THE WHOLE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE CONTRACT COULD EXIST BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT CODE. AYE THERE IS A CODE IN THE WOOFERS INSTITUTIONS CHO DEAD AT THE WAS. THIS IS HOW THE CONTRACT WAS PROVIDE TAUGHT US IN DON HAS MORE BACKGROUND INFORMATION AT WHICH WE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS SO THERE IS A A. CODE SECTION THAT ENCOURAGES US NONPROFITS THAT IMPOSED WITH DISABILITIES TO DO SOME OF THESE JOBS AND I ACTUALLY MARTINEZ IS THE IT'S A GREAT FRIEND AND WOOD WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND. I AND WE THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY TO GET OUT SOMEWHERE HERE AND. AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU OUT. A YEAR FROM NOW WE COULD BE LOOKING BACK IN I'M IN THAT MIGHT BE COMING BACK AND SAYING SOME MOST OF THESE WORKERS ARE OUT OF A JOB. WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR FOR EVERYONE IN FOR US BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. BUDGET CRAP FINAL IN ODD THAT WE ARE A NONPROFIT AND AND ALL OF US AND YOU HAVE FOR PEOPLE OF PRACTICAL WILLING IF. SOMEONE'S. THE DIRECTORS HIS HANDS ARE TIED. WELL WE HAVE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WHERE FLOOR OF A HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE LIKE HIM A LOT FOR THIRTY EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND SO IF IF IT NEEDS SOME TWEAKING TO MAKE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO EASIER TO MAKE. SHE'S DOING EASIER WILL WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TALKS THANK YOU. DON'T. THANK YOU. AND. THE THING THAT I'M JUST NOT. HAVE I GOT SOME HAVE TROUBLE WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IS IT SEEMS LIKE A ZERO SUM GAME HERE WHEN IT'S REALLY NOT. WE HAVE TWO VERY STRONG. SO PUBLIC POLICIES THAT WE OPERATE UNDER AND THAT IS TO TRY TO NOT CONTRACT OUT. AND HAVE A STRONG CAPABLE WORKFORCE FOR. DECISIONS ARE ALL THE REASONS THAT YOU SAID BUT WE ALSO AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DISABILITIES HAVE. A ROLE HAVE A JOB AND HAVE THAT AS WE HEARD THE PRIDE. THE ABILITY TO. THE DIGNITY TO WORK AND AND PROVIDE HOUSE AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE NOT ALL INCOMPATIBLE SO THERE'S. THERE HAS TO BE AWAY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IF IT'S MONEY HERE THAT WHICH IS WHAT THIS COMMITTEE IS ALL ABOUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN POTENTIALLY PUT ON THE TABLE BUT. THERE THERE'S ALSO OF A. APPEARS TO BE A CLASH OF POLICIES THAT SHOULD NOT AND DO NOT ACTUALLY CLASH. IF WE'RE SMART. AND IF WE ENSURE THAT WE CAN HAVE. THE WORK FORCE THE WAY WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO LOOK AND THE WORK FORCE IT INCLUDES ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING CALIFORNIANS WITH WITH DISABILITY SO. AND I AM HOPING WE CAN WORK A LITTLE BIT HARDER POTENTIALLY. PUT MONEY ON THE TABLE IF WE NEED TO BUT ENSURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING WITH AND AND. WE NEED TO CHANGE POLICIES WHICH I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NECESSARILY NEED TO. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BUT. DO WE WE NEED TO KEEP. PEOPLE EMPLOYED HERE WHO HAVE BEEN PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENED SO. FRUSTRATED THAT THEY SEEM ZERO SUM IT'S NOT AND WE NEED TO SORT THIS OUT AND WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO DO THAT SO I I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD. I HAVE THEM. AND AND MAYBE MISTER MARTINEZ CAN YOU HAVE CAN LET US KNOW. YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU THAT SEEM TO SAY IF IT'S. ON THE SURFACE APPEARS TO BE RELATIVELY SIMPLE BUT I GUESS IT REALLY IS NOT MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. THAN WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE AND I THINK EVERYONE'S HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE. I'M NOT SURE HOW WE GET THERE IN TERMS OF POLICY IN LAWS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE OUR MEMBERS WHO WERE ON THE DISABLED COMMUNITY IS A PART OF THE UNION AND GETTING THE BENEFITS IN THE RETIREMENT. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND I I AND. AND I KNOW HAVING WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DISABILITIES THEY ARE OF HARD WORKING VERY DEPENDABLE AND LOYAL EMPLOYEES. BETTER THAN THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE DISABILITIES IN TERMS OF THEIR CARE FOR THEIR JOB IN THE PRIVATE THEY HAVE BEEN. AND AND AND REALLY YOU KNOW OF LIKING WHAT THEY'RE DOING SOME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT IS PASSED. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THREE YEARS A TRANSITION IS COMING. THEY MOVING FROM PRIVATE TO CIVIL SERVICE I MEAN I GUESS WHO BEEN SUED OR SOMETHING IS THAT IT AND WE LOST THE LAWSUIT WE LOST SOMETHING. AND AS A RESULT THAT HAS THAT HAS TO THAT'S MONTHLY IN ME. RIGHT IN SO THERE'S THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT. FIRST IS YOU KNOW OF LOCAL ONE THOUSAND HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN FIGHTING AGAINST THE CONTRACTING OUT OF STATE WORK FOR MULTIPLE REASONS ONE. AS MISTER JONES SAWYER HAD MENTIONED THE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER HAD MENTIONED AT USUALLY A GREAT COST TO THE TAXPAYER TO CONTRACT THAT OUT SO WITH TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND OUTSOURCE CONTRACTS THAT THE STATE HAS. WE DO THE BEST WE CAN WITH OUR RESOURCES TO CHALLENGE THOSE. AND VICIOUS HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE CONTRACTS THAT WE CHALLENGED. WHEN WE DID CHALLENGE THE CONTRACT THROUGH THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS THE. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES. REVIEWED IT. REALIZED IT WAS A VIOLATION OF THAT GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION AND INSTRUCTED THE DEPARTMENT TO TRANSITION THAT CONTRACT AND THE CIVIL SERVICE. SO AND IN THE DEPARTMENT PUT TOGETHER THIS TRANSITION PLAN IF THIS. WAS GRIEVED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD PROCESS. I THINK IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE TODAY SO THE TRANSITION PLANT THAT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BY THE DEPARTMENT INCLUDES. MANY ELEMENTS TO MOVE ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES FROM THE PRIDE CONTRACT AND ITS STATE CIVIL SERVICE. NOW THIS YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RELEASED A CIVIL SERVICE IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT NOW. IT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR DEPARTMENTS TO DRAW FROM THOSE LESS AS THEY IT MENTIONED THEY'RE BRINGING MORE PEOPLE ON. AND THAT'S CURRENTLY MOVING. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT NOW TICKET HELP FACILITATE. MORE PEOPLE COMING ON TO THE TO THE LESS BUT I'DALSO LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE LEAP PROGRAM. I KNOW THAT THEIR IT'S NOT PERFECT. AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT. WE CAN DO TO HELP FACILITATE FOLKS. IT WITH DISABILITIES TO NOT ONLY GET THROUGH THE LESS BUT ALSO TO. GAIN EMPLOYMENT PEN IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE REALLY TWO. QUALIFICATIONS THAT A PERSON WITH DISABILITIES ASKED ME ONE DAY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE A DISABILITY AND TWO THAT THEY CAN PERFORM THE FUNCTIONS OF THE JOB WHICH. THE FOLKS THAT HAVE DONE THE PRIDE CONTRACT THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY BE THAT THEY MEET BOTH OF THOSE. SO I THINK WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT. TO. BRINGING MORE FOLKS. INTO STATE CIVIL SERVICE ACROSS THE BOARD WE THINK THAT THERE'S A PATHWAY THAT EXISTS THAT THE STATE CAN USE TO SELECT TAPE THAT TRANSFER OVER. AND. AS THE DEPARTMENT HAS MENTIONED THE TRANSITION STILL HAS ANOTHER. WHAT IS IT TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS? TO BE COMPLETED SO IT'S NOT LIKE ON JULY FIRST. STEWART I THERE'S A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE WE CAN WORK ON THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY COMES OVER AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. AND IF. SURE. EARLY ON WHEN STATE INTO THE MIKE SO OKAY. SORRY. EARLY ON WHEN WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO PUT TOGETHER THE TRANSITION PLAN IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE DID TRY TO KIND OF BY FOR KATE THE PROCESS WE WANTED TO RETAIN PRIDE ON ONE OF THE YARDS AT THE C. H. CF. AND UTILIZE THOSE STAFF TO KIND OF TRANSITION INTO THE CIVIL SERVICE YOU KNOW BUT POSITIONS BUT PRIDE SAID IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THEM. TO DO THAT THAT THAT PIECE OF PUT THAT ONE YARD AND SO WE DID LOOK IT OPTIONS. THAT WE THOUGHT WE POTENTIALLY COULD GET THROUGH THE PROCESS BY HAVING IT WILL BIFURCATED WITH. YOU KNOW ACCOMMODATING PRIDE TO A DEGREE AND THEN CIVIL SERVICE THE MAJORITY OF THE POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE THAT'S TRUE BUT. THEY DID THEY DIDN'T WANT TO ENGAGE IN IN THAT CONCEPT DE THEIR. MA'AM FROM A ADAM JUST TO COMMENT BACK ON. IT WAS TWENTY THREE POSITIONS. THAT THEN WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A FEEDER POOL TO CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES AND. THE REQUIREMENTS OF HAVING SIX MONTHS EXPERIENCE WOULD HAVE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO BE THE FEEDER AND. AND. ACCOMPLISHED A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION WITHIN A PARTICULAR YARD CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. TWENTY THREE PEOPLE IS PRETTY SMALL. IN THAT SIX MONTH WINDOW OF EXPERIENCE WOULD REALLY REQUIRED US TO HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY PEOPLE ON STAFF AT ANY ONETIME TO BE A FEEDER PULL. SO IT DIDN'T SEEM THAT THAT WAS GONNA BE EX EXCESSIVE ALL OPTION FOR EITHER PARTY THAT WOULD OF CA COMPOSTED REQUIREMENT. SO SO THAT WAS WHERE WE COME INTO THE DISCUSSION. LOOKING FOR OTHER OPTIONS. WE WERE ABLE TO FLEX OUR WORK FORCE IN PROVIDE JOBS. BECAUSE WE'RE CONTRACTED FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN POSITIONS. BUT WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY DEPENDING ON WHAT MONTH IT IS IN OURS WERE HIRING PEOPLE. SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO BE FLEXIBLE PROVIDE PART TIME JOBS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE CAN ONLY DO FOUR HOURS A DAY OR MAYBE KILLING DO. YOU KNOW TWENTY HOURS A WEEK. WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED WE ALSO PROVIDE YOU TRANSPORTATION FOR EMPLOYEES TO DISABILITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY WAY OF GETTING TO WORK. I DON'T THINK THOSE COUNSELING AND JOB COACHING. THE BENEFITS WOULD BE THERE ARE UNDER THE STATE'S CIVIL SERVICE% AND THAT WE PROVIDE THAT MAKES OUR EMPLOYEES SO SUCCESSFUL. IN A VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT. I I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WILL WORK. KEEPING THE FACILITY IN COMPLIANCE WHICH IT HASN'T BEEN WHICH YOU KNOW WENT INTO RECEIVERSHIP IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BECAUSE OF ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE WITHIN THE FACILITY. TODAY IT'S IT'S A HUNDRED PERCENT IN THE PRIVATE AREA THERE ARE NO DEFICIENCIES. YOU KNOW AUDITOR DID ANOTHER REVIEW LAST WEEK WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES OUR PAPERWORK OR COMPLIANCE OR PERFORMANCE. ARE SECTIONS PAST WEEK PASSED NAY CA AUDIT OPPOSITE INSPECTOR GENERAL AUDIT JACO AUDIT AND AUDITOR'S OFFICE PRODUCTS. AND THAT'S ALL BECAUSE PRIDES IN THERE NOW DOING THE WORK SO. I I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HERE FOR EMPLOYEES WITH DISABILITIES AND HOPING THAT WE CAN SAVE THOSE JOBS. NON PROPOSED DISABILITIES OKAY. THERE COMETH THE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A. SO THIS IS. BUT COMPLICATED THE ISSUE AND WE'VE GOT. WHERE IT WILL HOLD WE HOLDING THE ITEM OPEN WE HAVEN'T OUT? VOTED ON IT AND WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK. AND THAT'S THE MAIN GOAL YOU KNOW I KNOW S. YEAH YOU WANT TO MAKE IT WORK MOST OF US UP HERE HAVE VOTED AGAINST OUTSOURCING BECAUSE WE DO RECOGNIZE. THE VALUE OF BEING A CIVIL SERVANT AND AND THAT VALUE IS NOT ONLY FOR. EVERYONE IT'S ALSO FOR THOSE WHO DISABLED ARAB TRULY BENEFITS ONE RECEIVES FROM FROM BEING A PART OF. OF LABOR ORGANIZATION IN TERMS OF THEIR LONGEVITY AND RETIREMENT AND THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO TO SURVIVE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SO WHAT WE'RE HOLDING THE ITEM OPEN HOPEFULLY BETWEEN. NOW AND. THURSDAY OF WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOMETHING. IF NOT IN ACTUAL. ALLOCATIONS OF SAYS THAT MAYBE THE LANGUAGE AND INTENT OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THAT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU IS ALMOST THE SAME THING WE WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK. AND YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IN ALL CALIFORNIANS AND AND ALL OF US KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE DISABILITIES TO GET JOBS. THEY GET DECENT JOB THAT THEY CAN UP PARTICIPATED FILL VALUE AND THAT AND AND HAVING THOSE HAVE BEEN WORK FOR THE SYSTEM FOR A COUPLE YEARS. I KNOW THEY'RE PROBABLY VERY ATTACHED TO THESE POSITIONS AND ATTACHED TO THE PEOPLE WHO IN THE FACILITIES AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND SO. WE WANT TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT EXISTS IN THE STATE OF. ó THAT. THAT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO TO TO SATISFY EVERYONE WE KNOW WHERE THE TIME CONSTRAINTS AND AND WE UNDER LAWSUIT SO WE HAVE TO COMPLY. WITH THAT AND MAKE THAT TRANSITION BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW A IN ADDITION TO THE RULES THAT WE HAVE TO LIVE BY. THEIR ALSO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. WORKING AND AND AND AND WANT TO BE A PART OF IT SO HANK YOU ALL FOR COMING I REALLY APPRECIATE IT ARE HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO REACH OUT. TO YOU REACH OUT TO OUR STAFF THE NEXT DAY OR SO SO WE CAN TRY TO. FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS AND AND WE KNOW THE TRANSITION IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE OVER HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE TO DO THE TRANSITION CITY YEAR. IT'S ABOUT TEN MONTHS TEN MONTHS SO IT'LL BE HAPPENING THIS YEAR YEAH AND SO. HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO AT LEAST ACCOMMODATE MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WORKING. WITH THEIR WHO KNOW THE JOB YOU KNOW AND BECAUSE WHEN I HAVE TO OUR FOLKS ANYWAY AND ALSO HOPEFULLY. THAT'S A PART OF THE PROCESS IS NOT LIKE WHICH PLACE ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THE OF THOSE JOBS AT THE AND THIS THAT AND.
