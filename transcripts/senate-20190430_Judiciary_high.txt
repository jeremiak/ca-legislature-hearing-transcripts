I WOULD ASK THAT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE THIS COMMITTEE ROOM. THAT WE TRY TO KEEP THE DOORS CLOSED THE SOUND FROM THE HALL IS -- A MAGNIFIED TREMENDOUSLY IN IS A VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR IN VERY DISTRACTING SO -- THAT WOULD BE ON VERY HELPFUL TO US -- WE HAVE FIVE ITEMS ON PROPOSED CONSENT.

THE WELCOME AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE FIVE IN COMMON THREE IS THAT CORRECT RIGHT VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT -- SENATOR HERTZBERG OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS -- STEAM COMMITTEE -- IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE WASHINGTON POST. REPORTER ABOUT A FOUR YEAR OLD BOY IN BROOKLYN. WHO SUFFERED SEVERE NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE AFTER LIVING IN AN APARTMENT THAT WAS A LEGALLY COATED WITH LEAD PAINT? FOUR YEAR OLD BOY. THE BOY'S PARENTS TO THE LANDLORD. IN IN THE LITIGATION THE LAWYERS REPRESENTING THE BOY ESTIMATED THAT HE SHOULD BE AWARDED. THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DAMAGES THE AMOUNT WOULD HAVE EARNED OVER A LIFETIME WITHOUT INJURY. BUT LISTEN TO THIS MEMBERS THIS IS WHY I'M HERE IN THIS BILL. THE DEFENSE TEAM CALCULATED THE BOYS DAMAGE TO BE LESS THAN HALF AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN TERMS OF THE VALUE OF HIS LIFE. THE LANDLORDS ATTORNEY NOTED THAT BECAUSE THE BOY WAS LATINO. HE WAS UNLIKELY TO OBTAIN AN ADVANCED EDUCATION THAT WOULD GARNER THE LARGER INCOME AND THAT THE DEFENSE ESTIMATED HE COULD. HIS ATTORNEY ARGUED THE PORT THE PORTION OF HISPANIC COMPANIES ATTAINING MASTERS DEGREES WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 7%. SO HE WAS DECIDED WHAT IS WARDS WOULD BE AS ON THAT IS JUST ONE OF MANY MANY CASES THAT WE SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY JUDGES AND JURIES RELYING CALCULATION TABLES. MEMBERS THAT FORENSIC ECONOMISTS AND I HAVE A STEAM FRIENDS ECONOMIST HERE TODAY YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM. THAT USED TO PREDICT PLAINTIFFS LOST EARNINGSAND WAGES ON THE BASIS OF MEMBERSHIP IN A PROTECTED CLASS. THESE TABLES ARE BASED UPON THE FEDERAL CENSUS AND DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STATISTICS THAT BREAK DOWN POTENTIAL FUTURE EARNINGS. ALONG RACE AND GENDER LINES BECAUSE HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND WOMEN. IN UNITED STATES EARN LESS ON AVERAGE THAN THE WHITE AND MALE COUNTERPARTS FOR EXAMPLE THE DAMAGES THEY RECEIVE CAN BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER. THE PRACTICE IS UNCONSCIONABLE. BOND CONSTABLE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD NOT BE VALUED BASED UPON THEIR IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTIC SUCH AS RACE OR GENDER. AND YET THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING THE PLAINTIFFS IN CALIFORNIA COURT ROOMS AT THIS MOMENT. BEYOND THE INDIVIDUAL IMPACT ON THE PLANE IS THE ENACTED THIS INEQUITABLE AND REPUGNANT PRACTICE. HAS BROADER AFFECTS IT PERPETUATES SYSTEMIC INEQUITY. IT'S DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BECAUSE IT TELLS COMPANIES THAT YOU DON'T. HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DOING BAD ACTS IN POOR COMMUNITIES. ALL CALIFORNIANS MEMBERS ALL CALIFORNIANS DESERVE FAIR AND JUST COMPENSATION AND CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A STATE THIS IS NOT LED COURTS VALUE PEOPLE BASED UPON THEIR GENDER. WHAT THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN? AS I SAID I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND WITH ME TODAY IS VERY ESTEEMED GENTLEMAN ROBERT JOHNSON WHO IS A LEADING FORENSIC ECONOMIST.

INCOME FROM ANY OTHER RACIAL GENDER OR ETHNIC GROUP. OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO I WAS A FORENSIC ECONOMIST OF A TRIAL. IN WEST VIRGINIA THE THE EVOLVING A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. THE DEFENSE COUNSEL ASKED ME IF I HAD TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. HIS. THE FACT THAT HE WAS BLACK AND I SAID YES HE SAID BUT YOU USED WHITE MALES I SAID I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE. I SAID IN THE REASON IS BECAUSE IN AMERICA WE PAY PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR WORK ETHIC IN THEIR INTELLIGENCE. THE GOVERNMENT ATTAINMENT TABLES THAT. ALL ECONOMIST UTILIZE. NUMBER ONE THEY ALL. HAVE A FOUNDATIONAL BASS STARTING IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WELL THAT'S BEFORE BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION THE EQUAL PAY ACT I KNOW OF NO ECONOMIST. WHO STATE THAT WOMEN AND MINORITIES WERE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN HIRING PAY AND PROMOTION? THE ASSUMPTION OF THE ECONOMY IS GOING FORWARD IS ALWAYS. TO ASSUME THAT THEY PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW THE LAW EMPLOYERS WILL FOLLOW THE LAW. I TOLD THEM I HAD NO CHOICE AND THEN I SAID TO HIM. YOU WOULD PAY IN THE SAME HIS ANSWER WAS OF COURSE YES I SAID CITY. I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE THERE WILL BE NO SHORT. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA OVER 70% OF ALL STUDENTS. A SKINNY 70% OF THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA THE MNORITY OUR STUDENTS. AND WITH THAT MUCH OF THE POPULATION YOU NEED TO BE ABLE. TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF RACE GENDER AND ETHNICITY THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM OF JUST. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. I DID A CASE IN FRESNO WERE DROPPED BY. OVER 40% THE DAMAGES FOR AN HISPANIC MALE I HAD A WHITE FEMALE IN SAN DIEGO. WHERE WE WERE USING -- EARNINGS CAPACITY FOR MALES THE OTER ECONOMIST DID IT FOR FEMALES IT WAS A 3240%. REDUCTION AND FINALLYIN -- IF WE HAD A CASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY.

THEY'RE FINE WITH THE BILL I ASSUME SO -- WILL BRING THE BILL UP TO THE DYESS SO ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ART WE HAVE A A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL SENATOR ALLEN YOU HAVE A QUESTION I'M GONNA FOR SURE YOU'RE HAVING BROUGHT THIS TO THE COMMITTEE IT'S A THAT'S A DEPLORABLE AND THAT. ISSUE TRYING TO FIX AND I I AM VERY MUCH SUPPORTED. THANK YOU SIR SO I HAVE ONE QUESTION -- IT AND I ALSO AM DELIGHTED -- BECAUSE THIS IS -- CERTAINLY LONG OVERDUE BUT STATISTICALLY SPEAKING WOMEN LIVE LONGER THAN MEN SO AS WE'RE DOING THESE TABLES. I WONDER HOW WOULD THIS BILL PLAY OUT IN RELATION TO THAT FACT. WELL -- I THINK AS LONG AS WE DON'T UTILIZE. OF RACE OR GENDER TO LOWER. ANY CATEGORY THERE'S NO ISSUE. THANK YOU THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS HOPING TO HEAR ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION -- BY SENATOR. WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM THIS RIGHT I'M SORRY WE ARE STILL ONE SHORT OF A QUORUM. ALL RIGHT -- SENATOR HERTZBERG CLOSE LIKE TO CLOSE YES I'D LIKE TO READ THE BILL IN MY CLOTHES. THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. WHICH I APOLOGIZE FOR TIME BUT I'M GONNA READ IT TOO BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT. TO ONE SENTENCE ESTIMATION MEASURES ARE CALCULATIONS OF DAMAGES SHALL NOT BE BAED UPON SHALL NOT SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON AND SHALL NOT CONSIDER RACE ETHNICITY GENDER RELIGION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD AND WHEN THE TIME COMES AND WE HAVE A QUORUM WE WILL TAKE UP THAT VOTE THANK YOU SR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL DO -- YOU -- SB THREE EIGHTEEN IS ON CONSENT BUT SB. THREE FORTY TWO ARE AGAIN LET'S WAIT A SECOND FOR THE NORRIS. TO LEAVE. THIS IS OUR FILE ITEM NINE SB. THREE FORTY TWO NO. OTHER CONSENT ITEM WAS. SB. THREE EIGHTEEN ALL RIGHT THE SENATOR HERTZBERG MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'LL BE TAKING ON A FROM PAGES SIX AND SEVEN COMMENT NUMBER. THREE CORRECT I WILL BEGIN BY ACCEPTING COMMITTEES RECOMMEND AMENDMENTS ON THE PAGE SIXTEEN ALICE'S OWNERS YEAH. PAGE SIX IS SINCE SIX AND SEVEN REGION SEVEN OKAY. EXCEPT THE BY THE WAY THANK YOU FOR THE CONSENT IT WAS A BAIL BILL AND I HAD NEVER HAD AVAILABILITY CONSENT BEFORE IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME. TO SO I TAKE IT IN SO I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH -- THIS BILL HAS TO DO WITH WHAT'S CALLED THE TRUST IT'S ABOUT TRUSTED TICKETING EVERYBODY GOES OUT AND USES THESE YOU KNOW THESE AGENCIES ALIKE TO GET TICKETS. AND THESE THIS TECHNOLOGY MADE THINGS EASIER AND EASIER FOR US TO GO TO EVENTS IN THE LIKE TICKET SCALPERS. USED TO WAIT OUTSIDE OF GAMES AND CONCERTS SELLING OVERPRICED TICKETS THEY NOW CAN DISGUISE. THEMSELVES AS A CREDIBLE VENDOR ON LINE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS MEASURE SOME DISHONEST MARKETING COMPANIES MANIPULATE THE INTERNET SEARCHES FOR THAT WHEN SOMEONE TYPES IN THE VENUE OR AN ARTIST NAME. THEIR BAITED INTO VISITING A WEBSITE WHERE THEY'RE TRICKED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE PURCHASING A LOWEST PRICE TICKETS DIRECTLY FROM THE VENDOR WHICH ISN'T THE CASE THIS IS REALLY JUST KIND OF TRUTH IN ADVERTISING. ON THE INTERNET REALITY THEY'RE% PAYING AN ADVERTISING FEE AND SOMETIMES PAY MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE COST OF THE TICKET. THAT EXTRA MONEY SPENT BY CONSUMERS DOESN'T BENEFIT THE ARTIST FOR THE VENUE. BUT THESE ARE THE HIGH PRICES HAVE BEEN SHOWN ACTUALLY TO REDUCE ATTENDANCE AND REDUCED PRICING CAPACITY FOR TALENT. THIS MEASURE BASICALLY PUT HAVE DOES THE FOLLOWING ONE IT PROHIBITS A TICKET WEBSITE OPERATOR U. R. L. FROM INCLUDING THE NAME OF THE TEAM. THE NAME OF THE LEAGUE OR THE NAME OF THE VENUE WHERE THE LIVE ENTERTAINMENT EVENTS ARE HELD WE THINK THAT FOR PURPOSES OF PEOPLE DOING ONLINE SEARCHES THIS WILL AVOID. SOME OF THIS PROBLEM THAT HAS QUITE FRANKLY IN A SURPRISING MANNER HAS REALLY SPRUNG UP IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WAY AND WITH THE INTERNET AND THE MUSIC SIDE TAKING AWAY SO MUCH REVENUE FROM ARTISTS BECAUSE THEY CAN DOWNLOAD ANYTHING. IS JUST ANOTHER WAY WHICH IMPACTED PEOPLE'S CREATIVITY OR OR OR PEOPLE'S WORK WITH ME TODAY IS BRIAN HAS. ON BEHALF OF SPORTS FANS OUT ORG AND JOE RIGHT OUT. OF CONSUMER ACTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES EACH. THE CORD AFTER WERE LESS GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S JOE RIGHT OUT REPRESENTING CONSUMER ACTION SUPPORT OF SB THREE FORTY TWO WHICH A CRACKDOWN ON IMPOSTER. TICKET SELLING WEBSITES DECEIVE CONSUMERS SEEKING TICKETS TO EVENTS THESE WHITE LABEL TICKET VENDORS. ARE TYPICALLY OUT OF STATE COMPANIES THAT FALSELY IMPLY AN OFFICIAL CONNECTION TO LOCAL BOX OFFICES OR PERFORMERS OFTEN INCLUDING THE NAMES OF SPECIFIC. LOCAL VENUES WITHIN THEIR DOMAIN NAMES EVEN THOUGH THESE MIDDLEMAN SELLERS HAVE NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER TO THE LOCAL. THEN YOU ARE ARTISTS CONSUMERS WHO BUY TICKETS THROUGH THESE SITES PAY HUGE MARKUP OFTEN EXCEEDING 1100%. OVER THE COST OF EQUIPMENT TICKET BOUGHT THROUGH THE PLATFORM OF THE LEGITIMATE VENUE. WE DID A GOOGLE SEARCH AS AN EXAMPLE YESTERDAY FOR TICKETS TO THE TO RESCUE TRUCKS SHOW AT THE SACRAMENTO MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM ON MAY TWENTY FIRST. ON THE OFFICIAL TICKET SELLING SITE OF THE VENUE WHICH INCIDENTALLY APPEARS QUITE LOW IN THE SEARCH RESULTS WITH SELLING BALCONY TICKETS TO THE SHOW FOR THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS. BUT THE TOP OF THE SEARCH RESULTS HAD AN IMPOSTOR WEBSITE WITH THE U. R. L. AUDITORIUM SACRAMENTO DOCK WORK. HERE THE BALCONY TICKETS IN THE SAME SECTION WERE SELLING FOR SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS EACH AND EVEN WORSE SERVICE CHARGE WAS HIGHER TWENTY SEVEN TEN APIECE VERSUS THIRTEEN FIFTEEN FIFTY AT THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE CONSUMERS ALL TOGETHER WOULD SPEND 76% MORE. IF THEY WERE TO BUY THEIR TICKETS FOR THE MISLEADING LINK THAT APPEAR AT THE TOP OF THE SEARCH RESULTS. ZOOMER ACTIONS HOTLINES ALSO HEARD NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM FRUSTRATED CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WHOSE EXPERIENCES WHITE LABEL TICKET SELLERS HAVE LEFT HIM FEELING CHEATED AND MISLED. I'LL SHARE WITH YOU A FEW OF THEM. THIS FROM CHRISTY I FELT LIKE I WAS COMPLETELY MISLED BY A COMPANY CALLED SAM CISCO THEATER COMPANY. SELLING TICKETS TO A COMEDY SHOW IT DOESN'T MASONIC FOR WELL OVER DOUBLE WHAT THE ACTUAL MASONIC TICKETS GO FOR I CALLED TO COMPLAIN THEY ARE BASED IN CHICAGO UNDER SECONDARY MARKETPLACE SELLER I THINK IT IS CRIMINAL TO PASS THEMSELVES OFF AS AN SF THEATER. TICKET SELLING AGENT THAT ACTUALLY IS BASED IN CHICAGO AND RESELLS TICKETS THIS FROM EDITH SHE BOUGHT SOMETHING FROM TICKETS DASH CENTER DOT COM. I DID A WEB SEARCH TO BUY CONCERT TICKETS. AND WENT TO THE ORGANIZATION THAT WAS ORGANIZING THE CONCERT AND THEIR TICKETS WERE FIFTY DOLLARS LESS THAN WHAT I PAID FOR THANK YOU I THINK YOU MAKE THAT POINT. NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JACKSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIAN HAS I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SPORTS FANS COALITION THE NATION'S LEADING FAN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA SPORTS FANS I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT OF SB. THREE FORTY TWO FOR THE LAST DECADE SFC IS FOUGHT FOR FANS WE TACKLE ISSUES SUCH AS THE PUBLIC FINANCING A SPORTS STADIUM SPORTS BETTING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. MEDIA ACCESS FOR LOW INCOME FINANCE GENDER PAY EQUITY IN SPORT AND TICKET FRAUD. PASSING SB THREE FORTY TWO IN A RICH SPORTS CULTURALLY CALIFORNIA'S WOULD BE A MASSIVE BLOW THE FRAUDSTER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FANS. ESPECIALLY LESS TECH SAVVY ONES. WHILE ABLE TO GET SITES TO SEE FANS WHO THINK THEY'RE BUYING DIRECTLY FROM THE VENUE BOX OFFICE AT FACE VALUE BUT IN REALITY YOU'RE BUYING FROM A THIRD PARTY PRETENDING TO BE OFFICIAL. WELL I'M HERE ADVOCATING TO PROTECT SPORTS FANS THE FRAUD IMPACTS ALL FANS OF LIVE EVENTS. WHAT LABEL FRAUD LOOKS LIKE THIS THE CONSUMER WILL USE GOOGLE OR ANOTHER SEARCH ENGINE FOR TICKETS? MANY SITES WILL BE DISPLAYED. AND THINKING THEY'RE BUYING FROM THE OFFICIAL ONE BECAUSE THE WORD OFFICIAL WILL APPEAR IN THE U. R. L. -- THEY WILL CLICK DON'T GO THROUGH SEVERAL STEPS BEFORE REALIZING THEY'VE BEEN HIT WITH UPWARDS OF A THIRD OF A HIGHER PRICES ON THE FACE VALUE ITSELF. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WE INVESTIGATED THIS PRACTICE AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS FAR MORE RAPID THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED -- ON A SEARCH FOR WRIGLEY FIELD TICKETS FOUR OF THE TOP FIVE PAID RESULTS WERE DECEPTIVE WHITE LABELS AND FIVE OF THE TOP FIVE ORGANIC RESULTS WERE DECEPTIVE YOU ARE ELSE. WE ARE THE PROCESS OF REPLICATING THE STUDY FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE AND WALL. BUT THE PRELIMINARY PICTURES IS NOT GOOD. THE DANGERS OF THIS PRACTICE GO BEYOND JUST FALLING FANS IN THE PIC CLICKING ON THEIR SITE. THERE ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR SPORTS FANS FOR EXAMPLE RESELLERS WHO USE VIVID SEATS AND TAKEN THAT WORKS WHITE LABEL PLATFORMS FOR THE DECEMBER SIXTEENTH RAMS FIRST EAGLES GAME. DECEIVE FANS IN THE PURCHASING TICKETS FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MORE THAN THE FACE VALUE. IN SOME CASES BY CHARGING SERVICE FEES EQUAL TO ONE THIRD THE DISPLAY PRICE. SPORTS FANS COALITION BELIEVES OF THE USE OF DECEPTIVE WHITE LABEL U. R. L. SHOULD BE BANNED. AND ALTHOUGH THE FTC UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO CURB THIS PRACTICE WITH THE CONSENT DECREE. THERE IN FORCE IT WAS FAR TOO NARROWAND THE PRACTICE HAS PROLIFERATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE TESTS ARE WE ACTUALLY ARE HAVE A QUORUM SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND ESTABLISH THAT -- MEMSIC TERRY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK PRIOR HERE ON BEHALF OF A E.

FOR THE RECORD YES. JUST A JOKE NO I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR THIS. I AM A FIRST HANDWITNESS OF A CONCERT AND EVENT IN GETTING. A PLETHORA OF WEBLINKS AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO DISCERN WHICH IS AN OFFICIAL ONE SO. I WILL BE GLAD -- TO MOVE THIS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR BORCHERS. NO IT ARE WE HEARING THAT -- THIS WOULD BE TAKEN UP BY THE FEDS AT ALL. BUT WHAT THE FEDS -- THE CONGRESS. REMAIN. I WORK IN THIS ISSUE YEAH. YOU CAN ANSWER BUT OKAY HAVING TO GIVE AN OPINION THAT YOU ANSWER -- THERE IS SOME ACTION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND I'M I AM -- INVOLVED IN MY ORGANIZATION WITH THE FTC'S ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS INTO SEVERAL -- TICKET. A LIVE EVENT HARMS -- SO THERE IS A WORKSHOP COMING UP IN JUNE WHICH THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY TOPICS -- AND THERE ARE SOME OF FEDERAL LAWMAKERS WHICH ARE WORKING ON SOME LED BROADER LEGISLATION WHICH THIS COULD BE -- FOLDED INTO BUT AS A SAUSAGE GETS MADE IN DC WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU KNOW GETS CUT OUT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY GO TO CONFERENCE SO. WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD -- IF WE GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- AND AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL SO ON BEHALF OF MY WIFE MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. HAVE YOU EVER EXPLORED OR CENTERS FOR HAVE YOU EVER EXPLORED -- NOT JUST ENTERTAINMENT AND BUT AT THE OTHER THINGS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE AIRLINE TICKETS. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE WITH -- FOLKS BUYING AIRLINE TICKETS AS WELL. I HAVEN'T BUT IT BUT QUITE FRANKLY AS A ENGAGE IN THIS I DID A NUMBER OF THINGS WERE PEOPLE DO THESE PHONY DEALS WHERE. USED A COUPLE YEARS AGO IN THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE SIGNED UP AND THEY THEY STATE KEEP YOU SIGNED UP ON AND YOU CAN YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THE TICKET AND I'VE DONE A BUNCH OF THE STUFF INTERNET THE TO THE LEVEL AND RATE WHICH THE STUFF HAPPENING IS. PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY SO WHAT NO BUT IT'S A IT'S A GOOD IDEA. GOOD IDEA. SO NEXT YEAR THE HAVE A CLOSE IS MOSTLY THIS IS BECAUSE I HAD RUSSIAN. I'M SURE HAVE QUESTION -- SO I NOTED HERE THAT THERE IS A VERY -- ROLE BUST PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WHICH SOME OF US BELIEVE ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO ENFORCING RIGHTS WITHOUT THAT WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO FORCE OF RIGHT RELIEF WITHOUT A REMEDY IS NO RIGHT AT ALL SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH US YOUR THINKING ON WHY. I IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE YOU FELT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WAS APPROPRIATE. WELL I THINK THAT TO THESE ARE SMALL CONSUMER CASES BY AND LARGE YOU'VE GOTTA LOOK I JUST. THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU GOT A LOOK VARIOUS FACTORS UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS THIS WAS A GOOD. ONE ABOUT THAT. ALRIGHT WELL I KNEW I WAS GETTING SET UP ON THAT WITH THE STATE I I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR CREATING HAD ROOMS I CAN PUT MY SERVICE TAX ON THESE TICKETS. WELL THAT'S ANOTHER COMMITTEE BUT IN THIS COMMITTEE -- SERIOUSLY -- YOU KNOW BUT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS BEEN A PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC AND CONTINUES TO BE SO AND I'M JUST. CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOU FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO PROVIDE OF VICTIMS OF THIS KIND OF FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR TO BE ABLE -- TO EXERCISE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. IF YOU COULD GIVE US YOUR TWENTY SMALL CASES THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE I THINK IT'S AN EFFECTIVE TOOL SOMETIMES IT IS SOMETIMES IT ISN'T. I THINK YOU JUST GENERALLY SMALLER COMPANIES THAT ARE OUT THERE DOING THIS KIND OF THING AND BY AND LARGE IT'S A IT'S AN EFFECTIVE TOOL WE WE USE AND THE PRIVACY BILL -- FOR PURPOSES OF VERY LARGE -- ISSUES AS IT RELATES -- TO WHAT'S IT CALLED THE THE RATE DATA BREACHES YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR BOTTOM DOWN HAVE A DECADE YOU CAN TALK TO SOMEONE REPRESENTATIVES CONSUMER ATTORNEYS HERE. AND SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND THIS ONE I THINK THAT THESE ARE BY AND LARGE SMALL CASES THOUGH USUALLY SMALL PLAYERS. AND IT IN GRAYSON NECESSARY BALANCE I THINK TO MAKE SURE WE GET HIM OFF THE INTERNET. SO IT'S A IN SMALL CASES YOU THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE. I THINK IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL IT'S IT'S A GOOD IDEA. ALL RIGHT WELL [inaudible] OBVIOUSLY. IF YOU WERE NOT GOING TO GET AN ANSWER THE QUESTION I THINK IT RAISES A GOOD POINT THOUGH AND I AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S SOMETHING OF CONCERN TO ME THAT WE HAVE -- OF CONSIDERABLY BROADER I CAN TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR MITCHELL. NO NO NO I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR SENSE OF WHY YOU BOTHER TO PUT IT IN SINCE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE. A GOOD CONTROVERSIAL CONSUMER THEIR CONCERNS AND CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHY THIS ONE BUT I WAS APPROPRIATE TIMES AND IN THE YEARS I'VE BEEN AROUND INTRODUCED MEASURES IN SUPPORT LEGISLATION WITH PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN MANY MANY DIFFERENT DYNAMICS AND AND THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS THROUGHOUT. THE MANY YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS -- I CAN GO AND GIVE YOU A LISTOF THEM BUT IT'S NOT AS IF I'M AGAINST IT I THINK IS A REAL VALUE TO THE TIMES IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S WHAT I MAY I GENERALLY BELIEVE. LIKE I THINK BECAUSE IS MORE CASES I THINK THE GENERALLY ARE THESE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE THESE COMPANIES ARE OUT THERE DOING THESE PHONY BALONEY DEALS AND AS A WAY. TO SHUT HIM DOWN. IT'S HARDER FOR GOVERNMENT TO GO AFTER HIM AND THIS IS A CASE WHERE THAT IT WORKS [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT UGH DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE. ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU. WE HAVE DO WE HAVE A MOTION.

TWO WITNESSES ON EACH SIDE IF THERE AREN'T ANY WITNESSES THAT'S FINE. TOO ARTS CENTER CHIANG FLOOR SHORES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SB ONE EIGHTY REQUIRES THAT ALL SELLERS OF GENE THERAPY GETS KNOWN AS DO IT YOURSELF CRISPER KIDS MUST INCLUDE A NOTICE BEFORE PURCHASE AND WARNING LABEL ON THE PRODUCT TO NOTIFY CUSTOMERS. THAT THESE KIDS ARE NOT FOR SELF ADMINISTRATION. CHRISTOPHER'S AN ACRONYM FOR CLUSTERED REGULARLY INTERSPACE SHORT PALINDROMIC REPEATS WHICH ARE UNIQUE DNA SEQUENCES FOUND SOME BACTERIA AND OTHER MICROORGANISMS. CRISPER CAST NINE IS A NEW GENE EDITING TECHNOLOGY THAT OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR CAN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER. OTHER GENE EDITING TECHNOLOGIES AND EASE OF USE EFFICACY AND COST THE MOST STUDY CRISPER SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAST NINE PROTEIN AND IS KNOWN AS CRISPER. CAST. NINE DURING TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY THIRTEEN RESEARCHERS MODIFY CRISPER CAST NINE TO SERVE AS AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY FOR EDITING. THE GENOMES OF PLANTS ANIMALS AND MICROORGANISMS. MANY IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY BELIEVE CRISPER CAST NINE HAS ROUGH REVOLUTIONIZE GENE EDITING WITH ITS SIMPLICITY AND LOW COSTS RELATIVE TO OTHER. METHODS OF GENE EDITING AND CREATION OF NEW RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES. ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE ON CHRIS FOR TECHNOLOGY MANY EXPERTS CLAIM THAT CRISPER CAST. NINE TECHNOLOGY MAY OFFER THE MEANS PREVENT TREAT OR CURE MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES MALARIA SICKLE CELL DISEASE AND MORE HOWEVER. THERE ARE CONCERNS WITHIN THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY ON THE AMATEUR USE OF THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MATERIALS WITH THE CAPABILITIES OF EXPERIMENTING WITH CRISPER TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE BY IT BY THE PUBLIC. THESE DO IT YOURSELF CRISPER KIDS HAVE BEEN MARKETED FOR SELF ADMINISTRATION. THE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY THESE PRODUCTS HAVE BENEFITTED EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON CONSUMER SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. THEIR FINANCES IS CAUGHT ON VIDEO OF INDIVIDUALS INJECTING THEMSELVES WITH QUICK CRISPER CAST NINE EDITED MATERIALS WITH THE INTENTION OF EDITING THEIR PHYSIOLOGY. AS DR EMMA FROM OLD SYSTEM PREVENTION BIOENGINEERING POLICY IN SOCIETY FROM ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY HAS STATED. CHRIS BETWEEN EDITING TECHNOLOGY STILL QUITE NEW IN THERE ARE SEVERAL SAFETY AND EFFICACY QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOOSE TO EXPERIMENT ON THEMSELVES ARE POTENTIALLY PUTTING THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY AT RISK. SINCE THIS IS STILL VERY NEW TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE NEW HEALTH RISK EMERGING AS WE GO FORWARD. SEVERAL ARTICLES HAVE BEEN CITED HAVE EVEN SIDE OF POTENTIAL CANCER RISKS. THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH RESEARCH TEAMS HAVE RECREATED EXTINCT STRAINS OF VIRAL DISEASES FROM SCRATCH. THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY STATED THAT THE SALE OF GENE THERAPY PRODUCTS WITH THE INTENT OF SELF ADMINISTRATION IS AGAINST THE LAW. AND THE DEPARTMENT STATES CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY RISKS TO ENSURE CONSUMER PROTECTION WHEN PROTRUDE PURCHASING THESE -- TO YOURSELF CRISPER KIDS SB ONE EIGHTY REQUIRES THAT ALL SELLERS PROVIDE A NOTICE ON THE WEBSITE THAT IS DISPLAYED. FOR THE CONSUMER PRIOR TO THE POINT OF SALE AS WELL AS A LABEL ON THE PACKAGE CONTAINING THE CHRIS BOURQUE IT THINKING THAT THESE CHRIS FOR KIDS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR SELF ADMINISTRATION. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU'VE AGREED TO AMEND THE BILL AS US -- INDICATED IN ON PAGE SEVEN ITEM THREE TO AMEND THE BILL TO REQUIRE THE NOTICE BE PLACED IN A CONSPICUOUS LOCATION ON THE SELLER'S WEBSITE. AND REQUIRE THE LABEL TO BE IN PLAIN VIEW AND RENTAL READILY LEGIBLE ON THE PACKAGING SO YES ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ARE THERE ANY. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MARCHING NON LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS I JUST HAVE -- ONE COMMENT I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING. THIS BILL. I IT ALMOST SEEMS TO ME THAT. TO TO JUST SIMPLE SIMPLY. REQUIRE LABELING ON THE PACKAGING IN A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE MAY VERY WELL TRY TO ALTER THEIR OWN DNA -- SEEMS TO BE A BAND AID ON WHAT COULD BE A POTENTIALLY ENORMOUS PROBLEM -- BUT CERTAINLY. WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE FTA F. D. A. A STEP IN AND REALLY TAKE SOME ACTION HERE. BUT THEY HAVE YET TO DO SO SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS SORT OF AS A AND M. IMMEDIATE STEP THAT WE CAN. DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT ARGUABLY BEING PREEMPTED -- THIS IS KIND OF SCARY STUFF. AND IT'S SUB. OF CONCERN TO ME THAT THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THEY CAN ALTER THEIR OWN DNA OR BE RECKLESS REALLY ARE GOING TO PAY A WHOLE LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE PACKAGING. ON THE OTHER HAND IF IT DOES HELP A FEW PEOPLE REALIZE THAT. THE POTENTIALS HERE CAN BE -- ARE ARE THE POTENTIALS ARE UNKNOWN AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO -- I SUPPORT THE BILL AND THAT MEASURE WHICH MORE COULD BE DONE BECAUSE REALLY WE ARE NOW MESSING WITH MOTHER NATURE AND IN A MAJOR WAY SO -- I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT AGAIN I WISH WE COULD DO MORE BUT UNTIL THAT TIME THIS SEEMS LIKE A A GOOD. SMALL BUT IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT IS OUR MOTION. MOVE BY SENATOR BORCHERS SAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES SAYS SO JUST LIKE YOU HAD MENTIONED YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE DO NEED TO BE PROACTIVE ESPECIALLY WITH TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS THIS RATHER THAN REACTIVE -- AND WE REALLY JUST DON'T KNOW ALL THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE. REALLY QUITE INNOCUOUS AND FRANKLY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE HELPFUL OF BE HELPING BUSINESSES. WHO ARE DISTRIBUTING THESE KIDS? IF THERE WERE. TO HAVE SOMETHING HAPPEN TO YOU KNOW A CUSTOMER THAN THEY CAN SAY WELL WE HAVE A WARNING LABEL YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SELF INJECTING SO WITH THAT REDUCE BY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE SUPPORT.

THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- I JUST -- REITERATE THAT I AM GOING -- TO MOVE FOR WITH THIS AND TAKE THE AMENDMENTS -- MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS TEND TO HAVE LOWER INCOME THAN -- THE NON MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS IN A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEM LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. MOBILE HOMES ARE ONE OF THE FEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS THIS BILL HELPS KEEP. THIS SOURCE OF HOUSING AFFORDABLE AND HELPS KEEP SENIORS AND DISABLED PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. FIRST THIS BILL CLARIFIES A COMPANION LANGUAGE FOR MY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SB. ONE FORTY SEVEN SB ONE FORTY SEVEN PROVIDED FOR MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS WHO LIVE ALONE TO BE ABLE TO DESIGNATE A COMPANION. TO LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT A FEE SOME PARK OWNERS WHO HAVE INTERPRETED THE ONE CAMPAIGN THAT PER YEAR. AS ONE CAMPAIGN A TOTAL PER YEAR. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THE RESUME HAVE ONE CAN BE ANY THAT THE TIME UP TO THREE IN ONE CALENDAR YEAR. SECOND OF A MOBILE HOME PARK IS DESTROYED BY WILDFIRE OTHER NATURAL DISASTER THIS BILL WOULD OFFER PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS. THE THE FIRST OFFER TO LIVE IN THE PARK IF IT IS REBUILT. AS WE SEE -- YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASONS A GLOBAL WARMING LEADING THE CHANGES IN WEATHER PATTERNS NATURAL DISASTERS WILL BECOME. EVER MORE COMMON. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS IN MOBILE HOME PARKS AND ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES IN THE PARK IF MANAGEMENT CHOOSES TO REBUILD. THE ANALYSIS DOES RAISE SOME QUESTIONS THOUGH REGARDING THIS PROVISION IN I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- A AND STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK TO FIND LANGUAGES STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN ALLOWING HOMEOWNERSTO RETURN WHILE ALSO ENCOURAGING PARK HOMEOWNERS ARE SKEWS ME PARK OWNERS. TO REBUILD. THIRD THIS BILL PROVIDES A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT PARK MANAGEMENT SHALL CONSIDER WHAT APPROVING OR DENYING A PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER. AND WHAT PERSPECTIVE PURCHASERS CAN PROVIDE THE PARK MANAGEMENT. THESE CHANGES HELP CLARIFY WHAT PARK MANAGEMENT IS CONSIDERING IN THEIR DECISION PROVIDES GUIDELINES OF WHAT IS PRESENT -- THE PRESUMPTIVE ABILITY TO PAY AND LIMITS WHAT DOCUMENTS THE PARK MANAGER CAN REQUIRE. FURTHER THIS BILL STATES THAT THE PERSON IF A PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER IS DENIED FOR ABILITY TO PAY REASONS THEY CAN CHOOSE THEIR TO PROVIDE BANDS WITH ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION. THE GOAL OF ALL THESE CHANGES THE COURSE ARE TO HELP VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. BEAT BECAUSE OF AGE DISABILITY INCOME OR COMBINATION THERE -- FOR WHOM MOBILE HOMES ARE ONE OF THE LAST VESTIGES OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH ME TODAY YOU TESTIFIED SUPPORTERS BROUGH STANTON -- CORPORATE COUNSEL FOR THE GOLD STATE MANUFACTURED HOME OR SLEEK RESPECTFULLY ASK RIBA. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD WITNESSES PLEASE TWO MINUTES EACH. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE APPRECIATE YOUR HEARING ME TODAY. MY NAME IS ROGER JOHNSON. I AM A MOBILE HOMEOWNER. I LIVE IN A MOBILE HOME PARK I'M A SENIOR AND A VETERAN. SB TWO SEVENTY FOUR DEFINITELY WILL HELP OF WITH THE CLARIFICATION -- OF COMPANION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WE'VE ALREADY EXERCISED THE PROGRAM IN THE LAW IN EXISTENCE. AND IT'S HELPED MANY A PERSON A SENIOR PERSON. ON A FIXED INCOME. IN WHAT WE CALL AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITUATION. IN THE CASE WHERE A AND WE'VE HAD. THIS JUST HAPPENED IN THE LAST YEAR IN A NUMBER OF CASES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHERE. THE COMPANION OF WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO COHABITATING THE PROMISES AND HAD TO LEAVE DUE TO SICKNESS AND IN ONE CASE. DUE TO A DEATH. OF SOUL. WE'VE ASKED TO HAVE IT SPECIFIED THAT NO MORE THAN THREE COMPANIONS ONE AT A TIME. IN A CALENDAR YEAR BE DESIGNATED TO HELP WITH THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITUATION WHICH CLEARLY CLEARLY ALLOWS. IN MOST CASES THE SENIOR PERSON THE SINGLE PERSON TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE RESIDENTS. OF IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IT HELPS WITH THEIR DAY TO DAY IT HELPS WITH THEIR ASPECT ON LIFE AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN. THEIR VERY EXISTENCE IN SOME CASES ALSO BOB. WITH REGARD TO MOBILE HOME PARKS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED THROUGH THESE WILDFIRES IT CETERA IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH A GREAT IDEA TO OFFER THE FOLKS WHO CALLED. THOSE PARKS HOME IN THE PAST FOR THEM TO BE ABLE. TO RETURN TO HOME ONCE THE PARK IS REBUILD AND RE ESTABLISHED OF THERE'S NO PLACE BETTER THAN THE HOME THAT YOU ORIGINALLY LIVED IN -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EVERYONE'S AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLACE TWO MINUTES. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRUCE STATS AND I'M THE CORPORATE ATTORNEY FOR GSM WELL. I'LL JUST ECHO VERY -- QUICKLY THE COMMENTS OF THE PRIOR WITNESS I ACTUALLY HAD A CASE LAST YEAR WHERE THAT VERY THING HAPPENED WHERE THEIR DESIGNATED COMPANION IF YOU WILL MOVED OUT MID YEAR IN THE PARK HONOR DENIED MY CLIENT THE RIGHT TO REPLACE THAT COMPANION. CITING WHAT THEY A I BELIEVE TOOK AS A LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW BUT I DON'T THINK THAT. THAT WAS IT INTENDED CONSEQUENCE SO WEIRD YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS SECTION ONE WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO CLARIFY AND CURE THAT. AS TO SECTION TWO OF THE BILL WHICH IS THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL FOR RESIDENTS YEAH WE'RE PARKS A REBUILDING AFTER A BURN OUT. THAT. THERE WITH THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS A CLAIM THAT THIS IS TOO RESTRICTIVE AND I'D LIKE TO OFFER. TO A REJOINDER TO THAT FIRST. THIS SECTION ON THE ADDRESS IS THE STARTING TERMS OF THE TENNESSEE. IT'S DESIGNED TO BASICALLY RETURNED THE STATUS QUO IT DOESN'T PREVENT THE PARK OWNER FROM RAISING RENTS IF THE PARK WOULD NEED TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE BEING NEEDED TO BE SUPPORTED. IF IN FACT THERE'S NO RECKON TROLL -- ANY KIND OF A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE RENTAL AGREEMENT COULD BE NEGOTIATED. AND BASICALLY THE PART WOULD BE IN THE SAME POSITION IT WAS IN BEFORE THE FIRE WHICH WAS A COULD CHARGE WHATEVER IT WISHED. UNDER THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IF THERE IS RANKING TROLL THEN THE PARK COULD ALWAYS APPLY FOR FEAR RETURN INCREASE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ORDINANCE. IF THE PARK GOING TO BELIEVE NOW WE CAN'T SUPPORT THIS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE PREVIOUS ROUND. ADD TO SECTION THREE THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE. IN MY EXPERIENCE I CALLED. THE BLACK HOLE OF THE MOBILE -- RESIDENCY LAW BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW PERSPECTIVE PURCHASERS ARE PROVED WE HAVE THIS. LANGUAGE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PAY THE RENT TO RATHER CHARGES OF THE PARK BUT THERE'S NO DEFINITION REALLY GIVEN TO THAT. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS AS THE PARK OWNERS HAVE CREATED THIS INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF THIS THREE TO ONE RATIO. OF INCOME OVER HOUSING RELATED EXPENSES BUT WHAT THEY DON'T. TYPICALLY DO IS COUNT ANY OTHER ASSETS THAT THE RESIDENT HAS BEYOND SOCIAL SECURITY AND CALM JOB INCOME. AND SO YOU HAVE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE OUR PERSPECTIVE PURCHASERS WHO HAVE I. RISEN STOCK. TRUST FOUR OH ONE K.'S OTHER REAL PROPERTY AND NONE OF THEM ARE AT HIM AND CONSIDERED I HAD TWO SITUATIONS A BRIEF THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS FOLLOWING UP WILL BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO BUT AGAIN ON THE TWO MINUTE TEACHING GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXTRA ROOM AS WELL -- OTHER OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT IF YOU PLEASE STEP. TO THE MICROPHONE YOUR NAME. YOUR AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR ELIZABETH ESPINOSAHERE THIS AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY NAME IS HELEN FREDERICKS AND I'M A SENIOR MOBILE HOME OWNER AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. MY NAME IS ROBIN LEWIS AND I'M A RESIDENT AT HERITAGE JOKES CLAYTON. IN ORANGE FILE AND I AM I AM HOPING THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. ARM WHILE FELLOWS. FROM MY MOBILE COUNTRY CLUB IN RANCHO CORDOVA. AND I'M A MOBILE HOME OWNER AND A MEMBER OF G. S. M. ON YES THEM WHILE. I ASH YOU FOR VOTING FOR MONDAY. THANK YOU SIR. MY NAME IS JOE FELLOW SULLIVAN. IN A MOBILE HOME PARK. I AM A MEMBER OF G. S. M. O. L. I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO PLEASE VOTE FOR THIS. FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHELLE MONNING I AM THE H. O. A PRESIDENT OF A THREE HUNDRED PLUS FLIGHT HOME MOBILE HOME PARK. I AM ALSO THE SACRAMENTO AREA COALITION MOBILE HOME OWNERS ASSOCIATIONS LONG WORDS -- THERE SECRETARY AND A MEMBER OF GSM ALLOWED AND I AM URGING SUPPORT OF SB. TWO SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU. JOHN CLARK MANUFACTURED HOMEOWNER AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR. PROPERTY MERRY VAN CLEEF I'M THE INTERIM PRESIDENT OF ALMOST CHAU SECTION. OF THE MOBILE COUNTRY CLUB WHICH HAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED OWNERS. AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD STEP FORWARD TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. JASON ANCHORED WITH THAT'LL STING GILBERT ROPES AND SPENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE AND OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- WANT TO START BY EXPRESSING MY SINCERE AND HEARTFELT SYMPATHIES TO TO VICTIMS OF OUR CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES. I GREW UP -- JUST SHY OF AN HOUR FROM THE TOWN OF PARADISE AND I I DO KNOW FOLKS WHO ARE ARE VICTIMS WHO LOST HOMES IN THE CAMP FIRE LAST YEAR -- SO IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE TOUCHES A LITTLE CLOSE TO HOME AND AGAIN WE WE HAVE A LOT OF SINCERE SYMPATHY FOR IT. HOWEVER WE WE ACTUALLY SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT ARE NOTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS. THAT THAT THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL THAT'S INCLUDED IN SB TWO SEVENTY FOUR COULD POTENTIALLY ACTUALLY. I CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR PARK OWNERS TO REBUILD THEIR PARKS -- THE IN SHORT WHAT THE WRITER FIRST OF REFUSAL REQUIRES IS THAT FORMER RESIDENTS BE GIVEN A SIX MONTH PERIOD IN WHICH THEY CAN RETURN TO THE PARK ONCE IT IS REBUILT. AND CLAIM. A SPOT UNDER THE SAME A TENANCY AGREEMENTS THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY HAD AS IS ACTUALLY NOTED BY THE PROPONENTS THE REALITY IS THAT. A POKE PARK OWNER IS ALSO THE VICTIM OF A WILDFIRE WHEN THEY'RE PARK IS DESTROYED THERE ARE A LOT OF COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLEAN UP THERE ARE A LOT OF COST ASSOCIATED WITH REBUILDING. AND A PARK WILL BE REBUILT WITH NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND POTENTIALLY NEW AMENITIES AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY THE THE RENTAL AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE. WHEN A RESIDENT BECAME OR A TENANT OF THE PREVIOUS PARK THE PARK THAT WAS WAS DAMAGED AND BURNED DOWN A WILDFIRE? DOES NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL COST AND THE MARKET VALUE OF THAT. OF THAT SPACE GOING FORWARD SO THE REALITY IS THAT THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL INCLUDED IN THE BILL. MIGHT POTENTIALLY REQUIRE APARK OWNER TO OFFER A SPACE EITHER AT AT A LOSS OR OR AT THE VERY LEAST. A BELOW MARKET RATE -- SO AGAIN THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT WHEN FACING THAT AS A PERSON WHO IS A VICTIM OF WILDFIRE AND ONE FACING THE COST OF REBUILDING. YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY CHOOSE. TO AVOID THE RISK OF OF HAVING TO DO THAT AND AVOID THE RISK OF HAVING FURTHER LOSS AND DID NOT-REBUILD THE PARK SO WE ARE CONCERNED AGAIN IS THAT. YOU WOULD CREATE A SITUATION IN WHICH A A PARK OWNER MAY CHOOSE NOT NOT TO REBUILD THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY MY NAME IS JOE CARROLL -- MEMBERS THAT PRECEDED BEING AIRED THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND MY ACT I'M A LOCAL SACRAMENTO ATTORNEY I REPRESENT ABOUT A THOUSAND PARKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I HAVE -- OPPOSITION TO SECTIONS TWO AND THREE BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SECTION THREE FIRST -- THIS RELATES TO SOME OF THE CHANGES THE CIVIL CODE SECTION SEVEN NINETY EIGHT SEVEN FOUR I AM CONCERNED THE CHANGES PROPOSED. MAY SEVEN PLACES CENTER WE COULD SEE AN INCREASE IN RESIDENTS DEFAULTING AND FAILING TO PAY SPACE RENT. THIS COULD ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A RESIDENT LOSING THEIR HOME WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT AN OUTCOME ANYONE WANTS. AS THEIR VERSUS CALIFORNIA'S IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STANDARDS DEPENDING ON WHERE THE PARK IS LOCATED. THAT BEING SAID ALL MOBILE HOME PARKS REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW TO PUBLISH THEIR STANDARDS OF OCCUPANCY. AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO POTENTIAL RESIDENTS OF THAT THERE IS NO MYSTERY TO THE PROCESS IN OTHER WORDS. IF YOU'RE SELLING A HOUSE THE PARK OWNERS REQUIRED TO GIVE YOU THEIR STANDARDS OF ARGUMENTS IN IT MAYBE THREE TO ONE OF MAYBE. FOUR TO ONE THEY MAY ALSO REQUIRE THAT THERE NOT BE ODD YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE A CREDIT SCORE BUT IT'S ALL CONSIDERED TOGETHER. AND SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT -- DESERT THESE STANDARDS ARE IN THERE TO ENSURE THAT -- THERE TO BE ACTUALLY APPLIED TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES BY ARBITRARILY LOWERING THE STANDARDS REDUCING ONE OWNER CONSIDER WHEN APPROVING A RESIN FOR TENDENCY. FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRED APART TO ACCEPT OR PROVE APPLICANTS WHO EITHER HAVE LESS INCOME AND OR BAD CREDIT. IT'S FORESEEABLE THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO MORE OBJECTIONS WARS HAVE MORE PEOPLE COMING LOSING THEIR HOME. ONE WHERE I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY MAJOR ISSUES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW RELATED TO THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND A RESIDENCY STANDARDS. IF THE COMMITTEE DOES CHOOSE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL TODAY. I WOULD SUGGEST CHANGES TO BE MADE THE CIVIL CODE SECTION SEVEN NINETY EIGHT SOME FOR D. AND FOR TWO SEVEN NINETY EIGHT SOME FOR DE TO TO BE ELIMINATED IN ITS ENTIRETY -- IT. IN REGARDS TO CIVIL CODE SECTION SEVEN NINETY EIGHT SOME. FOR REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE PARK IS LOCATED IF THE BILL GOES INTO LAW AS IT CURRENTLY STATES -- REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE PARK IS LOCATED OF ITS ON THE OCEAN WHAT AMENITIES IT OFFERS. IF EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO GO BY THE THREE TO ONE RATIO -- I SEE TO CONCERNS OF WHAT COULD OCCUR -- COULD YOU WRAP IT UP VERY QUICKLY I WILL SO THE UNDER THE UNDER CURRENT STANDARDS -- ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT WITH THE LOAN PROVISION WHERE IF YOU AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY FOR BANK LOAN. IT'S NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH I MEAN NOT FAMILY MEMBER COULD LOAN MONEY AND THEREFORE THEY WERE AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFIED WE THINK THAT. AS THE CITY THAT PROVISION SHOULD BE ELIMINATED IN ITS ENTIRETY. AND THAT WE BE ALLOWED TO LOOK AT BOTH. INCOME STANDARDS AND CREDIT SCORES AND NOT ONE OR THE OTHER SO IF YOU HAVE CREDIT. BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO SEE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE MAY HAVE INCOME TERRIBLE CREDIT IT'S ALSO EASY TO SEIZE THE DOORS WERE SO MAY HAVE GOOD CREDIT. LAST POINT AND I TYPICALLY I US AMERICA TROUGHS OF WAITED A SEVEN NINETY EIGHT EIGHT SIX THIS PROVISION THIS PENALTY PROVISION IN HERE BASS SHOULD BE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED. THAT IS -- THE SEVEN NINETY EIGHT SOME FOR ANY CAN AND TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH PROVISIONS THANK. AB THREE MINUTES WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THAT SO SOMEBODY HAS QUESTIONS THEY'LL BE HAPPY. TO OFFER YOU AND OF ANY OTHER WITNESSES PLEASE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING AND HEARING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DIET SHOULD ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. QUESTION FOR ONE OF YOUR SUPPORT WITNESSES. THE THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY DETERMINATION. THE REASON A MALL. AND YOU SAID THE RULE OF THUMB IS. THREE TO ONE WHAT'S THAT BASED ON THAT'S BASED ON AN INDUSTRY PRACTICE THAT'S JUST SORT OF BEEN CREATED BY PARK OWNERS AND THEN FOLLOWED. TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT NEVER REALLY TRACKED INTO LANDING PRACTICE. AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I'VE ALWAYS SEEN WITH THIS SENATOR IS THAT. THE PARK OWNER. PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER REQUIREMENTS ARE STRICTER THAN THE MOBILE HOME LENDING REQUIREMENTS EVEN THOUGH THE LENDERS HAVE A FAR GREATER RISK HERE -- THEN THE PARK OWNERS HAVE. SO I HAVE A CONSTITUENT A RETIRED POSTAL WORKER LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME. BEEN PAYING HER RENT FOR THE SPACE OF THE MOBILE HOME SHE OWNS IN A PARK SOME. HAS BEEN DENIED A RENEWAL. BASED ON THIS FINANCIAL -- CAPACITY QUESTION SHE'S NEVER MISTER RENT PAYMENT. BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET HER OUT OF THE PARK. USING THIS STANDARD. WITH THIS BILL ALLOW HER TO PROVIDE. OTHER INFORMATION OTHER THAN HER -- RETIREMENT INCOME I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THE SITUATION YOU DESCRIBE IS NOT. THE SAME AS WHAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE SINGLES ADDRESSING A PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER. IN FACT -- I'D WANTED TALK TO HER AND KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. BECAUSE PARK OWNERS CAN'T DO WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED RIGHT -- WELL I APPRECIATE THAT COUNSEL AND MAYBE WILL FOLLOW UP. LATER -- BACK TO THE BILL IN CHIEF -- WITH THE THE QUESTION THIS FOR THE AUTHOR MAY DID -- FOR PARK OWNERS FROM REBUILDING IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED. BY FIRE WERE DESTROYED BY FIRE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. WELL THAT WAS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT -- I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT -- BE WELL WOULD TO WORK WITH THE YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION ON THIS I THINK WHEN YOU REALLY. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN BURNED OUT OF THEIR HOMES PARTICULARLY IN MOBILE HOMES THAT HAPPENED OVER AND SNOW MY COUNTY -- GIVING THEM THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL AT THE END THEY KNOW THE YEAH OF THE AL GOOD SOMEBODY'S CREDIT IS A AHEAD OF TIME IS. YOUR EXAMPLE I THINK WAS IN TUNE WITH WHAT MY INTENTION WAS HERE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S BEEN READING IN THIS PARK. FOR FIVE YEARS FOR TEN YEARS A ADD -- NEW YELLED LOOK AT WHEN THEY HAVE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INCREASE THEIR RATES. BUT IF SOMEBODY'S GOT A TRACK RECORD WITH THE COMPANY IN TERMS OF THEIR CREDIT PAYING THEIR BILLS ON THEIR MONTHLY RENT ON TIME I THINK THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY SHOULD DESERVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. TO COME BACK IN A AND READ THAT SPACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MEASURE -- THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THE MOBILE HOME OWNERS. ARE THE THE OFTEN THE GREATEST VICTIMS DURING THESE DISASTERS JUST BECAUSE VERY DIFFERENT INSURANCE FRAMEWORK VERY DIFFERENT REBUILDING FRAMEWORK SO I APPRECIATE YOU. TRYING TO GET THEM SOME. SOME KIND OF CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT LIFE LOOK LIKE AFTER THE RECOVERY -- SO I'VE I'M HEARING FROM YOU WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES I WANT TO SIGN ON TO THIS WITH YOU AND JOIN IT WHATEVER YOU DO TAKES AMENDMENTS AS A AS A CO IF YOU. IF YOU -- BE WILLING TO BUT DO YOU WANT TO FLESH OUT. I DIDN'T WANT TO CUT OFF THAT CONVERSATION AT IF IT'S PRODUCTIVE TO BE HAD THIS REMAINING ISSUE. SURE OF THAT THAT FINAL SECTION THAT THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP. THE WORTH FLUSHING THAT OUT WOULD YOU MIND. YEAH I I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY. POSSIBILITY THAT I'M GONNA STRIKE -- TWO SECTIONS OF THIS BILL OUT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR AND HONEST AND FORTHRIGHT TO THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT. IS WE DON'T WANT TO DIS INCENTIVIZE MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS FROM COMING BACK IN IN REBUILDING THE VERY PLACES. THAT WE NEED THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO THIS BILL. THAT WOULD MAKE THAT EVENTUALITY -- MOOT -- IS SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE. TO THAT'S THE TYPE OF LANGUAGE I WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER -- AS IT FAR AS THE MEMORY THIS BILL AND YOU. AND IS THERE ANYTHING SOUTH OF JUST STRIKING ENTIRELY THAT YOU THINK CAN RESOLVE THAT ISSUE OF YOU GUYS GIVEN THAT ANY THOUGHT. YOUR YEAH WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS IS THAT THERE IS ALREADY IN CIVIL CODE SECTION SEVEN NINETY EIGHT EIGHT SIX OF THE MOBILE RUNS A LOT IN ORDER THE ALLOWS -- FOR IF THERE'S A CLAIM FOR WILLFUL BREACH OF THE STATUTORY SCHEME TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PENALTIES AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT WE WOULD THAT AND WHAT THEIR MAKE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL SAYS THAT THERE'S A VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE. THEN THERE'S A PRESUMPTION BUT THERE'S ALSO A VIOLATION SEVEN NINETY EIGHT EIGHT SIX WILLFUL DAMAGES. EVEN IF THERE'S A NEGLIGENCE SITUATION SO FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE MADE A MISTAKE IN CALCULATING THE NUMBERS. AND SOMEONE'S DENIED WHETHER OR NOT THEY DID IT BY INTENTION NOW THAT THIS BILL SAYS THAT THERE'S A PRESUMPTION THAT. THERE IS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO WILLFUL DAMAGES. AND SO ON WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING THAT'S NOT A LOSS OF NINETY EIGHT SIX A BUT THERE IS WELL FULL THEY STILL HAVE THAT RIGHT BT IF IT'S NEGLIGENCE WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN. IS THAT ALSO BE PENALTY DAME DAMAGES FOR NEGLIGENCE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I AM A I THINK THE ANALYSIS DOES A GOOD JOB RECOGNIZING THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL THE SHAPE THE OBSERVATIONS ARE. THAT THIS IS STILL NEEDING SOME WORK I MEAN THE GOAL IS BASICALLY WE DON'T WANT. TO SEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. OF HAD MOBILE HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED FIRES NOT BE ABLE TO REBUILD WE DON'T WANT TO DIS INCENTIVIZE SAID -- AND I THINK YOU I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES NOW THE THE QUESTION ABOUT -- THE PARK OWNERS REBUILDING BUT HAVING TO BASICALLY LEAVE CERTAIN EXPENSES THE SAME WAY THERE'S INSURANCE THAT COMES IN -- THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF FACTORS THAT -- I THINK ARE CERTAINLY AVAILABLE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION HERE BUT I APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF THIS MEASURE -- I ALSO APPRECIATE THE NEED TO HAVE A PENALTY. THIS IS NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN PARK OWNERS AND HOMEOWNERS AND THAT IS BEEN A CHALLENGE. WITH THESE MOBILE HOME PARKS FOR A LONG TIME AND IN ORDER TO TRY. TO EQUALIZE THAT PLAYING FIELD IF YOU WILL -- SOME OF THESE TYPES OF SANCTIONS I THINK APPROPRIATE BUT I'M SURE THAT -- SENATOR DODD WILL -- ENGAGE IN FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR ABOUT. NOT BEING WILLING TO TAKE OUT A FEW OF THE OF THE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS OF THE BILL AND I SUPPORT YOU ON THAT WEEK WE REALLY NEED TO FIND A WAY. TO TO GET PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR HOMES IF THAT IS THEIR THEIR CHOICE AND NOT. TO TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND CERTAINLY DO IT IN A WAY THAT -- WHERE THIS SELF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING OF THE PARK OWNER -- BECOMES AN OBSTACLE WOULD I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WAS ARE APPRECIATE THAT AND WITH THAT -- WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION AND THEN ASK YOU TO CLOSE CERTAIN CAN MAKE A QUICK COMMENT ON SOARED INTO THAT YOU HAD A QUESTION -- YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR DODD -- I CERTAINLY AS AS YOU MAY BE AWARE MY DISTRICT IS VERY -- THE MOBILE HOME COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO MY DISTRICT AS WELL I'M A FIRE PRONE DISTRICT ALSO -- I SUPPORT THE BILL IN THE THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE AMENDMENTS ARE SIGNIFICANT AND OUR STAFF HASN'T HAD A ENOUGH TIME TO REVIEW THE MALL SOMEONE BE LAYING OFF TODAY. BUT I I THINK IT'S GONNA BE SUPPORTABLE WE JUST WANT TO GET TO A HIGHER LEVEL CONFIDENCEON THANK YOU. RIGHT WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THAT JUST JUST. MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS THAT ED TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED -- SB ONE FORTY SEVEN THAT BILL IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS QUITE DIFFERENT THAT AND THE BILL THAT ENDED UP PASSING AND AND FRANKLY WE'RE BACK HERE TODAY. CLEANING UP SOME OF THAT BECAUSE WE PERHAPS ALLOWED MAYBE ONE TOO MANY OF THEM IT ODD THAT SPECIFIC BILL. BUT AS IS I THINK MY REPUTATION HERE I WILL WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS -- TO TRY TO TO COME TO SOME COMPARABLE COMPROMISE WHICH AGAIN TO THE CHAIRS BOYD. YOU KNOW HELPS HELPS MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT -- MOBILE HOPE HOME PARK OWNERS ARE NOT DISINCENTIVE IZED -- TO REBUILD SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. WITH THAT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FLOOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS ALLEN. ALLEN I CABALLERO. JONES. MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN STERN I AM BURKE. WHITE HOUSE SKI. ALL RIGHT THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES AND WE WILL PUT IT ON CALL THANK YOU -- CENTER DOT THANK YOU TO THE WITNESSES. UP NEXT SENATOR MITCHELL OF FILE ITEM EIGHT SB [inaudible] THREE TWENTY NINE AND AGAIN MINUTES TEACHER WILL HOLD OFF FOR A MOMENT SO THAT WE CAN CLEAR. THE ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR WHAT ARE YOU? THANKS FOR COMING TODAY THE NUMBER. FIVE I'M DEBORAH THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL HAVING YOU ARE YOU GOING TO TESTIFY FOR THE DOOR. WHEN BOTH OF OUR NATION LET'S [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OUR COLLEAGUES WE ARE ON A FILE ITEM EIGHT SB. THREE TWENTY NINE HOLD ON ONE SECOND. WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT. THE HALLWAYS VERY BUSY MADAM CURRENTLY SO AND IT THE NOISE IN THIS -- HEARING ROOM BECOMES. ALWAYS VERY HARD TO HEAR. ALL RIGHT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOME. SOME ORDER IN THE COURT SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON WITH FILE ITEM MADE SENATOR MITCHELL FLOORS YOURS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL THREE TWO NINE COLLEAGUES. THIS BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT LANDLORDS CANNOT REJECTED TENANTS SOLELY BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEIR RENT IS PRIMARILY IS PARTIALLY PAID FOR BY GOVERNMENT. ACROSS OUR STATE CALIFORNIANS RECEIVING HOUSING ASSISTANCE ARE STRUGGLING TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY DO THE BLANKET POLICIES OF LANDLORDS WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT. AT THE SAME TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO HOUSING ASSISTANCE AS A WAY OF SHIELDING TENANTS FROM HIGH HOUSING COSTS IMPROVEMENT IN HOMELESSNESS. AS REPORTED IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES EDITORIAL ON THE NINETEENTH OF THIS MONTH. SENATE BILL THREE TWO NINE WOULD NOT REQUIRE THAT LANDLORDS RENT TO SUBSIDIZE TENANTS. LANDLORDS SIMPLY WOULD HAVE TO TREAT TENANTS TO RECEIVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE THE SAME WAY THEY TREAT OTHER PROSPECTIVE TENANTS. PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO SCREEN TENANTS FOR RENTAL OR CREDIT HISTORY. CHECK REFERENCES AND SET OTHER COMMON STANDARDS. EVEN COUNTY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES THROUGHOUT OUR NATION HAVE IMPLEMENTED WATER CALL SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS FOR ASSISTED FAMILIES WITH GREAT SUCCESS. CITIES IN THE OUR STATE INCLUDING SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE HAVE INCLUDED THEM. THE CITY COUNCIL LOS ANGELES OF CURRENTLY HAVE VERY RECENTLY AS OF LAST WEEK DRAFTED AN ORDINANCE IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IS LOOKING INTO IT AS WELL. AGAIN LANDLORDS WOULD STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCREEN VOUCHER HOLDING APPLICANTS USING THE SAME CRITERIA THEY USE FOR ANY OTHER POTENTIAL TENANTS. THIS BILL WOULD BAR THEM FROM REFUSING SOMEONE'S APPLICATION JUST BECAUSE THEY GET HELP TO PAY THE RENT. THE US DEPARTMENT. OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PUBLISHED A REPORT THAT LOOKED AT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF HOUSING FOR FAMILIES WITH SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS. THAT STUDY FOUND THAT FOR EVERY THIRTY NINE RENTAL ADVERTISEMENTS FOR APARTMENTS THAT A FAMILY WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE COULD AFFORD THERE WAS ONLY ONE THAT DID NOT EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT VOUCHER HOLDERS FROM APPLYING. WHERE SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS WERE NOT IN PLACE DENIAL RATES FOR ASSISTED FAMILIES WERE AS HIGH AS 75% OR MORE? IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS THIS DID NOT RATE WAS ALMOST CUT IN HALF. THIS SITUATION IS UNACCEPTABLE IF WE FIND OUR FOUNDER CELLS FOR EXAMPLE FACING DATA THAT 75% OF GROCERY STORES REFUSED TO ACCEPT CAL FRESH AND PEOPLE COULD USE IT TO BUY FOOD. WE WOULD CRY FOUL. WE SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THE SITUATION FOR THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE WE GIVE ARE STRICTLY RESIDENTS EITHER ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A PROVEN POLICY AVAILABLE TO CORRECT IT. THE HOUSING CRISIS IS IT HARD FOR LOW INCOME RENTERS RISING RENTS LACK OF AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND STAGNANT INCOMES MAKES ITS POPULATION THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS. YOU ARE COLLEAGUES AND THE COMMITTEE HAVE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF LETTERS OF OPPOSITION AND SOME CONCERNS I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR TODAY. AND SO I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE MAGICALLY SOME OF THE MAJOR -- CONCERNS RAISED IN AND CHALLENGE -- THEIR POSITION. LET ME CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VOUCHERS IN THE MARKET. NOR REQUIRED THAT ALL LANDLORDS EXCEPT EVERY VOUCHER HOLDEN APPLICANT. THE BILL REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO ALLOW ASSISTANT RESIDENTS TO APPLY WHILE ALSO ALLOWING THEM TO RE APPLY TO EXCUSE ME TO APPLY THEIR RENTAL CRITERIA. TO ACCEPT TO DENY A FAMILY WITH ASSISTANCE IN THE SAME WAY THEY WOULD ANY OTHER FAMILY. BECAUSE THE BILL DOES NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VOUCHERS WE DON'T THINK IT WILL INCREASE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS FOR HOUSE FOR THE HOUSING AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE STATE. IF ANYTHING HOUSING AUTHORITIES WILL BENEFIT FROM THE FACT THAT FAMILY WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCESSFULLY USED THEIR VOUCHER RATHER THAN RETURNING IT WHEN IT EXPIRES ON THE HOUSING AUTHORITY BEING FORCED TO REPROCESS A RE ISSUE THE VOUCHER. WE'RE PLEASED TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HOUSING AUTHORITIES AS A CO SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. FURTHER THE BILL DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT LANDLORDS MAKE CHARGE FOR RENT. IF AN ASSISTED FAMILIES ABLE TO AFFORD THE RENT BEING CHARGED THE BILL ALLOWS THEM TO APPLY BUT DOES NOT FORCE LANDLORDS TO RENT ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL OR TO COMPLY WITH SECTION EIGHT PAYMENT STANDARDS. WHEN SOMEONE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER APPLIES FOR DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THE APARTMENT IS INSPECTED TO MAKE SURE IT MEETS BASIC REQUIREMENTS? WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THAT MIGHT CAUSE A UNTENABLE DELAY FOR THE LANDLORD. THE HOUSING AUTHORITY LOS ANGELES IS WORKING TO REDUCE THE TIME FOR INSPECTION FOR EXAMPLE FROM WHAT THEY REPORT TO BE THE CURRENTLY ONE WEEK. THE INSPECTION SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A BURDEN SINCE IT IS PERFORMED TO MAKE LANDLORDS COMPLY WITH THEIR EXISTING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PROVIDING HEALTHY HOUSING FOR ALL THEIR TENANTS. LASTLY THERE WAS A CONCERN EXPRESSED ABOUT -- INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND IF THEY WOULD BE THEY THEY WOULD UNDULY INCREASE. INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY BARRED FROM ASKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER HOUSING ASSISTANCE IS ACCEPTED BY A PROPERTY OWNER. THERE WAS A BILL -- PREVIOUSLY A MAIENSCHEIN BILL -- THAT COVERED THIS ISSUE BUT AGAIN LET ME BE CLEAR. UNDER CURRENT LAW. INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE BARRED FROM EVEN ASKING THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER HOUSING ASSISTANCE IS ACCEPTED BY THE PROPERTY OWNER. CALLING THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF HOUSING VOUCHERS WAS TO HELP PEOPLE ATTAIN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ENABLE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE AWAY FROM AREAS WITH CONCENTRATIONS OF HIGH POVERTY. AREAS WITH GREATER OPPORTUNITIES. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES WHY THIS IS -- A VALUABLE WAY TO HAVE DIVERSE COMMITTEES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS IN TERMS OF ACCESS - TO GREEN SPACE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION AND FEDERAL. THIS BILL WILL ENABLE FAMILIES WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO SUCCESSFULLY APPLY FOR AND OBTAIN HOUSING THEY CAN AFFORD. IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT BEING LITERALLY TURNED AWAY AT EVERY DOOR AND FORCED TO RETURN THEIR ASSISTANCE AND USE. TODAY I AM PROUD TO HAVE WITH ME MADAM CHAIR LATOYA MCNEIL WHOSE AND AFFECTED RESIDENT WHO CAN TELL US HER OWN STORY AS WELL AS DEBORAH THOUGHT WITH THE NATIONAL HOUSING LAW PROJECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON A TWO MINUTE TEACHER IF YOU WOULD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR M. MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. MY NAME IS LATOYA MAKE MALE AND I REPRESENT FAITH IN THE VALLEY SAN JOAQUIN AND PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. I AM HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. THREE TWO NINE WHICH WILL HELP TENANTS WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE BY REQUIRING LANDLORDS TO LET THEM APPLY FOR HOUSING JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE. I PREVIOUSLY HAVE SECTION AND HAD A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER TO HELP ME PAY MY RENT. ALTHOUGH INTERNALLY I WAS EMBARRASSED AND I HATED THAT I NEEDED THAT KIND OF HELP. I WAS STILL VERY GRATEFUL. MY HOPE WAS THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT WOULD. PROVIDE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE STABILITY FOR MY SON SO THAT HE DIDN'T BECOME ANOTHER STATISTIC. WHEN I GOT THE VOUCHER I ONLY HAD TWO MONTHS TO LOOK FOR AN APARTMENT THAT INCLUDED THE OWNER ACCEPTING IT ME MOVING IN? I ENDED UP LOOKING AT THIRTY TO FORTY APARTMENTS PAYING THE APPLICATION FOR EVERY SINGLE. ONE AFTER I GOT MY VOUCHER I HAVE RECALL I HAVE TO REQUEST AN EXTENSION. THAT WILL -- SO THAT I HAD MORE TIME YEAH -- BECAUSE NONE OF THE APARTMENTS. WERE ALLOWING ME TO APPLY WITH MY VOUCHER. KNOWING THAT THE VOUCHER WAS GETTING READY TO EXPIRE I WAS SO STRESSED I WAS SICK TO MY STOMACH I WAS HAVING A ARD TIME SLEEPING. I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON WHAT SEEM TO BE A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY. WHEN I FINALLY FOUND AN APARTMENT? I WAS SO ECSTATIC. IT WAS THE LAST DAY THE VERY LAST DAY BEFORE THE EXT. IT WAS GOING TO EXPIRE. I CANNOT EVEN GET BEGIN TO EXPRESS HOW OVERWHELMED WITH JOY I WAS. I HAD FINALLY SECURED A SPOT FOR MY SON AND I THAT WE COULD AFFORD. AND WE WERE NO LONGER HOMELESS. ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER MOVING IN I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN I REALIZED THAT. I NEEDED TO FIND A NEW HOME-BECAUSE THIS PLACE WAS INFESTED. IN THE ENTIRE COMPLEX AND I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE HOME INVASIONS. UNFORTUNATELY. I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE WITH THAT VOUCHER. SO I WENT AHEAD AND GAVE UP THE VOUCHER. SO THAT I COULD FIND SOMETHING SOMEWHERE ELSE NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO GIVE UP THEIR HOUSING ASSISTANCE AFTER SPENDING YEARS WAITING. TO FIND. SOMEONE THAT WOULD ACCEPT IT. PLEASE VOTE YES ON SB THREE TWENTY NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES. THAT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS DEBORAH THROW FROM ASUPERVISING ATTORNEY AT THE NATIONAL HOUSING LAW PROJECT OR SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. ALONG WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS SB THREE TWENTY NINE A HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES ACT PROVIDES THAT LANDLORDS CANNOT THE NINE APPLICANT HOUSING. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE USING A FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL RENT SUBSIDY THE LAW WOULD APPLY TO ALL HOUSING ASSISTANCE BUT THIS WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON RENTERS LIKE LATOYA. THAT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WHO OF HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS SUCH AS SECTION. EIGHT ACTUALLY ABOUT HER BY FAR THE LARGEST FEDERAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN OUT IN CALIFORNIA. THERE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THE STATE USING SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS TO LIVE IN SAFE AND STABLE HOMES. THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS IS THAT OF AFTER HOLDER MUST FIND A LANDLORD IN THE PRIVATE MARKET WILLING TO PARTICIPATE. WHAT'S THE TENANT SIGNED THE LEASE THE TENANT THEN PAYS THE LAMB ARE DIRECTLY FOR THEIR PORTION OF THE RENT WHICH IS TYPICALLY 30% OF THEIR INCOME. AND THE HOUSING AUTHORITY PAYS THE REST OF THE RENT DIRECTLY TO THE LANDLORD. IN PART TO THE COMPETITIVE RENTAL MARKETS IN MANY PARTS AROUND OUR STATE THE REALITY IS NOW THAT FAMILIES ARE UNABLE TO USE THEIR VOUCHERS I'M SIMPLY BECAUSE THE WAY I LARGER UNWILLING TO RENT WITH THEM. THE DOOR IS CLOSED BEFORE THEY EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO APPLY. THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR MANY REASONS FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT IT CAUSES MANY FAMILIES TO RETURN THE HIGH POVERTY AREAS AND WE'RE REMAIN HOMELESS. IT ALSO MEANS THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT RECEIVING THE FULL BENEFIT FROM THE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES IT RECEIVES BECAUSE VOUCHERS ARE NOT BEING UTILIZED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS MEN MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ADOPTED LOCAL SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTION SOME TO BRIEFLY TELL YOU WHAT THE BILL WILL DO AND WHAT IT WILL NOT DO IMPORTANTLY. THE FIRST BILL PROHIBIT ALL LANDLORDS IN CALIFORNIA FROM DENYING AN APPLICANT HOUSING SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF USING A SUBSIDY LIKE SECTION EIGHT SO IT'S GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR TO NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. IT WILL PROHIBIT ALL LANDLORDS IN CALIFORNIA FROM ADVERTISING NEW SECTION EIGHT AND I URGE YOU ALL TO GET ON CRAIGSLIST AFTER THIS HEARING GET A AND LOOK AT THE HOUSING LISTINGS AND YOU'LL BE SHOCKED ABOUT THE NUMBER. OF ADS THAT SAY THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON CHURCH JACKSON MEMBERS -- CREAM THREE CM HALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS -- HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO SB. THREE TWO NINE US SB THREE TWENTY NINE REDEFINED SOURCE OF INCOME TO INCLUDE AMONG OTHER THINGS -- SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS -- THIS IN OUR ESTIMATION EFFECTIVELY REQUIRES ALL RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS TO PARTICIPATE IN HARD TO SECTION EIGHT HOUSING PROGRAM. A IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT SECTION IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE VOLUNTARY BECAUSE UNLIKE CASH VOUCHERS SECTIONING TALES EXTENSIVE COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY. UNIT INSPECTIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS TO TAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR PHIL WILL THE UNITS IT'S VACANT. MOST NOTABLY SECTION REQUIRES THE LANDLORD TO ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT KNOWN AS A HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS OR HAVE A CONTRACT. SB THREE TWENTY NINE REQUIRES ALL LANDLORDS PARTICIPATE IN THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM. HE'S ME BY FORCING THEM TO ENTER INTO A HOT A HAPPY CONTRACT THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH MAY BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FILL. OUT LAST YEAR SEE OUR WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON SB THREE ON SB EXCUSE ME ON AB. TWENTY TWO NINETEEN TEN WHICH REQUIRES ALL LANDLORDS. TO ACCEPT CASH VOUCHERS FROM THIRD PARTIES HOWEVER THAT BILL EXCLUDED SECTION EIGHT BECAUSE SIX NAY REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO CONTRACTUALLY ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT AND SUBJECTS AND OTHER BURDENSOME STANDARDS -- CA ARE ENCOURAGES THIS COMMITTEE -- AND THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE BUT TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS SUCH AS SB FIVE TWO ONE BY SENATOR PORTANTINO -- WHICH WOULD STEP EXCUSE ME WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A TAX CREDIT. TO INCENTIVIZE MORE LANDLORDS TO VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM. HOWEVER FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED -- WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR NO VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON AT DEVER CARL TO THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SO FIRST LET ME STATE IS NOT ABOUT. THE TENANTS IT'S ABOUT THE PROCESS IN FACT MOST OF OUR OWNERS WILL SAY THAT -- SECTION EIGHT TENANTS ARE VERY GOOD TENANTS THEY PAY ON TIME AND FOLLOW THE RULES IT THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT THAT MANY OWNERS FIND IS. AS MR TREES HE SAID IT'S ABOUT THE PROCESS AND WHILE LA WE HAVE FOUND IS A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT. MANY THE HOUSING AUTHORITIES ARE NOT -- WE WOULD LIKE AS AGAIN AS MR GREASY IT INDICATED -- IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO ENCOURAGE OWNERS THROUGH A TIGHT TO TAX CREDITS -- AND SOME SORT OF EDUCATION PROCESS BECAUSE OF COURSE HOUSING AUTHORITIES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE TIME TO PROVIDE THE EDUCATION THAT MANY THE OWNERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE LENGTHY -- CONTRACTS AND IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO SHORTEN UP THIS INSPECTION PROCESS SO THAT OWNERS DON'T FEEL THAT THEY ARE LOSING. RENT AND TIME I THINK THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME WAY WHETHER IT'S THROUGH TAX CREDITS OR SOME SORT OF OTHER PROCESS. TO HELP WITH THE PROGRAM AND FOR THAT -- WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE RUN KINGSTON REPRESENTING THREE REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS EAST BAY RENTAL HOUSING. THE APARTMENTS S USUAL ORANGE COUNTY AND THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STUDIES WE URGE YOUR OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AFTER MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ADAMANTLY BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN RESPECT OPPOSITION THANKS THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. JONATHAN AIRBORNE BEHALF OF THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LOS ANGELES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BARTLET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR CAFIERO. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS -- CAN ANYBODY TELL ME WHAT THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION. EIGHT OUR THAT OUR OWNERS. SPECIFICALLY A YES SENATOR -- SO ONE OF THE CONTRACTUAL AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL -- ONE OF THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS -- DEALS WITH THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE -- TO PASSED THROUGH ALL YOUR RENT INCREASES -- THROUGH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY -- AND THEY'RE ALSO OTHER PROVISIONS AS WELL WE ARE THE RESPONSE TIME IS SUCH FROM THE FROM THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY THAT THAT IF THAT WOULD SHORTEN THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL -- AND I'M SORRY I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT -- BUT THERE'S THERE OTHER -- PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THERE THAT A BY THINK THE MAIN THING IS THAT BASICALLY ANYTHING IN THE CONTRACT -- THAT YOU WANT. TO I'M SORRY THAT YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH IN IN TERMS OF RENT INCREASES OR ANYTHING DONE TO THE UNIT HAS TO PASS THROUGH THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY AND SOMETIMES THE RESPONSE TIMES ARE SUCH THAT IT CAN TAKE UP TO SIXTY DAYS -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE FIND PROBLEMATIC -- THAT AND AS MISS CARLTON NOTED -- YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT -- SMALL MOM AND POPS OF FOR INSTANCE IF. YOU'RE OLD YOU'RE AN ELDERLY COUPLE AND YOU ON A SINGLE FAMILY HOME AND YOU HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL UNIT AS A RENTAL UNIT. AND YOU GET A PROSPECTIVE TENANT WHO IS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE BUT HAS SECTION. EIGHT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT SMALL LANDLORD -- WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM OR FINDING OUT ABOUT THE HAVE CONTRACTOR CONTACTED LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY -- SO THERE'S AN EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT AS WELL. IN A AT THE WHEN I CLARIFY SO THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME REGULATION AROUND SOME OF THOSE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE EVERY INSPECTIONS REYES A LOT -- UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN THE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER PROGRAM ACTUALLY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY HAS TO DO THE INSPECTION OF THE UNIT PRIOR TO THE TENANT MOVING IN WITHIN TWO WEEKS ON THERE SOME EXCEPTIONS BUT FOR THE MOST PART. HOUSING AUTHORITIES ARE REQUIRED% TO DO THAT INSPECTION PRETTY QUICKLY SO THE IN MOST CASES IT WILL BE WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME PERIOD THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME NEW FEDERAL REGULATION AROUND THINGS LIKE BACK PAYMENT OF RENT -- SEWER RECENT CHANGE IN THE LAWS THAT HAVE A RESIDENT MOVES INTO A VOUCHER UNIT -- AND LET'S SEE THE INSPECTION DOES TAKE TWO TO THREE WEEKS THE LAMMERS NOW ACTUALLY ENTITLED TO BACKGROUND -- UP UNTIL THE DAY THAT THE TENANTS ANALLY SO. EITHER ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I'M SORRY NO NO I I THINK YOU FOR THAT AYE AYE THE THE REASON I ASK THE QUESTION IS THAT I YOU KNOW I I GENERALLY -- REALLY RESPECT THE RIGHT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO DO WITH THEIR PROPERTY WITH A WELL -- BUT THE SITUATION IS GOTTEN SO OUT OF CONTROL RECENTLY. THAT -- THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF BEING ABLE TO GET AND KEEP A PLACE AND TO ACTUALLY FIND SOME PLACE TO RENT HAS BECOME OVERWHELMING. FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE AND IT EIGHT FIVE EIGHT YOU KNOW IT. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH PEOPLE THAT TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEIR RENT WENT UP A 100%. IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND THEY'RE DESPERATE BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE STEP AWAY FROM ENDING UP ON THE STREET AND SO. OUR ABILITY TO COME UP WITH THESE VOUCHER PROGRAMS AND TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE GET AND MAINTAIN -- A PLACE TO LIVE BECOMES CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I AM I IT IT'S OVERWHELMING AND IN IN MY DISTRICT AND IT'S ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE ISSUES THAT I HEAR OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S THE REASON I ASK THE QUESTION BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO GET A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT. IS THE BURDEN THAT WERE ASKING THAT THE REALTORS OR THAT THE MAN LE LAND MANAGERS FOR THE OWNERS TO TO BEAR AND ARE THERE THINGS WE CAN DO ABOUT IT TO MAKE IT EASIER AND SO I APPRECIATE THE DETAIL BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME TO KNOW. WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION OF OF THE THE LANDOWNER SO DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS HAVE NO FOR THE QUESTION [inaudible] VERY BRIEFLY. ONE COMMENT IF I MAY. A SENATOR. THE FOUR HUNDRED PAGE CONTRACT WHICH IS PLACED BEFORE EVERY PROPERTY OWNER THAT ACCEPTS A SECTION EIGHT HAS TWO OTHER REALLY ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS WHICH CAUSE A DELAY. IN BECAUSE REALLY CURIOUS RELUCTANCE OF FOREST ONE IS INSPECTIONS INSPECTIONS AT THE INCEPTION OF THE CONTRACT. DON'T TAKE A WEEK I JUST CONFIRMED -- WITH THREE LARGE PROPERTY OWNERS AND MANAGERS IN LA. AND IT'S THIRTY DAYS TO FORTY FIVE DAYS FOR GONE RENT. AND WHERE IS THEY COULD RENT TO SOMEBODY WHO A MEDIA LADY. WHO IS AVAILABLE TO MOVE IN NOW TO INSPECTIONS EVERY YEAR? YEP THEY HAVE INCIDENTS IN LOS ANGELES WHERE THE TENANT SECTION EIGHT TENANT REFUSES TO LET THE INSPECTOR IN. IN DURING WHICH TIME. THE LANDLORD IS NOT PAID IN A GOES ON WEEK AFTER WEEK AFTER WEEK. THESE TYPES OF ISSUES -- ALL THE SUBSTANTIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THE INSPECTIONS WITHHOLDING RANT NON PAYMENT OF RENT. DURING ALL THESE DELAYS CAUSES US -- RELUCTANCE NOT TO ENGAGE IN SECTION EIGHT IF YOU THINK YOU. WE'RE DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR POINT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR ALAN. SO I MEAN THESE. SO I GUESS MY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR MISS SOME OF THE PROPONENTS HOW HOW DO YOU AND IS IT DO YOU KNOW OF WORK AFOOT TO TRY -- TO YOU KNOW MAKE SECTION A LITTLE BIT MORE -- YOU KNOW A APARTMENT OWNER FRIENDLY IN IN YOU KNOW THE SENSE SAID -- MAKING IT SO THAT IT'S IT THEY DID THEY THEY WANT [inaudible] TO TAKE -- THEY DID THEIR MORE MOTIVATED TAKE SECTION A CLIENT ON THE NATURAL. THE LET ME FIRST CLARIFY A MISSTATEMENT THAT CONTINUES TO BE RATED THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYONE TO ACCEPT SECTION. EIGHT IF YOU HAVE THREE APPLICANTS. ONE A SECTION EIGHT ELIGIBLE TO ARE NOT AS LONG AS YOU PUT EVERYONE TO THE SAME CRITERIA. AND THEY ALL MATCH YOU CAN PICK WHICHEVER -- TENET YOU CHOOSE. THIS IS NOT REQUIRING ANYONE TO ENTER INTO A SECTION A CONTRACTED THEY AS A LAND OWNER DON'T CHOOSE TO DO SO. SECTION EIGHT IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM -- I THINK THERE'S THE TRUTH IS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE WE'VE HEARD HOUSING% AUTHORITIES SAY THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE A LONG THIRTY TO FORTY DAYS SO SOME OF THESE EXPERIENCES I'M SURE ANECDOTAL I DON'T KNOW IF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY ASSOCIATION GIVE US A AN AVERAGE I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THAT WE ALL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO WORK WITH SECTION EIGHT WITH OUR HOUSE THE OUR LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITIES IN AND TALK TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. I ALSO KNOW THAT ALL OF US AS WE'RE LOOKING AT HOUSING PACKAGES IN TRYING TO THAT ONLY RE HOUSE RESIDENTS IN OUR DISTRICTS BUT KEEP PEOPLE HOUSE. WE CAN STEM THE TIDE OF THE EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF HOMELESS. BOMB. EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT WHAT ABOUT SECTION EIGHT AND THE ASSUMPTION IS HE WEIGHTLESS WE ALWAYS ASSUME PEOPLE ON THE WEIGHTLESS I THINK FEW OF US WERE REALLY AWARE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH VOUCHERS IN HAND. WHO CAN'T USE THEM OR TRAIN THOSE DOCTORS BACK INTO THE HOUSING AUTHORITIES? THIS IS A REAL STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. THIS BILL AND THE THE THE PORTANTINO BILL THAT DEALS WITH -- INCENTIVES FROM FOURTH FOR LANDLORDS ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. GREAT LIFT INCENTIVIZE OF LANDLORDS TO THE DEGREE THAT WE CAN THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THIS BILL AGAIN DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYONE INTO INTO A CONTRACT. AND I WOULD ALSO -- DID JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER YOU OWN AND HALF FOR RED ONE UNIT OR HUNDREDS YOU. AS A LANDLORD NOW ABOUT YOUR HOUSING. AUTHORITY REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO PAY A FEE PER UNIT TO THIS NOTION THAT -- SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WOULDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO READ THE CONTRACT ENGAGE I THINK IT'S A FALSE NARRATIVE BECAUSE AS A LANDLORD WITH ITS ONE UNIT OR HUNDREDS THERE IS A PROCESS YOU GO THROUGH IN TERMS OF MAINTAINING. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF YOUR PROPERTY -- AND GOING THROUGH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- I AGREE WITH US INTO CABALLERO AS A LANDLORD THATEVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO WITH THEIR PROPERTY WHAT THEY SO CHOOSE AGAIN THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE. THAT ANYONE TAKE SECTION EIGHT IT SIMPLY SAID THAT YOU CAN'T BAR SECTION EIGHT APPLICANTS FROM APPLYING IN ONCE IF YOU HOLD THEM TO THE SAME STANDARD. YOU HOLD ANYONE ELSE. BACKGROUND CHECKS -- CORRECT CREDIT THANK YOU CREDIT CHECKS ALL THOSE THINGS THAT THEY JUST BE GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY. THE THE HOUSING AUTHORITY EVEN MAKE THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD THE RENT FELT ALL OF THAT WORK IS DONE. THANK YOU SENATOR BORGIAS. THANK YOU -- QUICK QUESTION CENTER MITCHELL -- I HAD A LANDLORD ASKED ME A QUESTION NO THE ANSWER FORGIVE ME IF YOU ALREADY ANSWERED IT EARLIER -- IS THERE A IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN HOW -- IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN HOUSING STANDARDS. IN OTHER WORDS IF A SECTION EIGHT ELIGIBLE COMPLEX. I AM MUST BE HELD TO A STANDARD THAT IS DIFFERENT. MAY. CERTAINLY THE HABITABILITY AND SHE WAS THE BASELINE BUT ABOVE THAT. IS THERE A DISTINCTION. OR SO -- WE TALK ABOUT INSPECTIONS FOR THE VOUCHER PROGRAM ARE USING A STANDARD CALLED THE HOUSING QUALITY STANDARDS IT'S U. S. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES. HAVE A SET OF STANDARDS BY WHICH THE INSPECTORS AND INSPECT THE INDIVIDUAL UNITS PRIOR TO THE TENANT MOVING IN -- BOX AT BEING VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE STANDARDS THERE RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AND FRANKLY I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THOSE UNITS ARE GETTING INSPECTED EVERY YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN SAFE AND HABITABLE CONDITIONS RIGHT AND SO. ONE AT THIS ALSO GOES TO THE EARLIER -- QUESTION AROUND FEDERAL STANDARDS SO ONE CHANGE TO HOUSING QUALITY STANDARD RECENTLY FOR THE VOUCHER PROGRAM IS THAT. OF LANDLORDS CAN ACTUALLY NOW SUPPLEMENT OTHER INSPECTIONS SO LET'S SEE YOU ON A TAX CREDIT BUILDING WHICH BY LAW YOU HAVE -- TO HAVE ALREADY THERE IS A PROTECTION FOR ABOUT HER FAMILY'S OR SOME OTHER FEDERAL SUBSIDY YOU ACTUALLY CAN SUPPLEMENT THAT INSPECTION PROCESS FOR THE HOUSING QUALITY STANDARDS JUST OFF ANOTHER JUST. WAY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MAKING IT EASIER FOR LANDLORDS THAT ARE ALREADY UNDERGOING SOME TYPE OF FEDERAL OR STATE INSPECTION TO ALLOW IT TO QUALIFY. FOR THAT ANNUAL INSPECTIONS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO UNDERGO MULTIPLE INSPECTIONS YEAH SO ON FOR HABITABILITY PURPOSES -- I'D IZZARD ANNUAL INSPECTION REQUIRED. THROUGH ACCOUNTING FOR EXAMPLE EVERY YEAR. SEPARATELY YEAH THERE'S NOT WHETHER IT'S SEPARATELY THEN THE VOUCHER PROGRAM. YEAH I'M TRY TO FIGURE OUT IS THERE A DISTINCTION AND IS THERE MORE -- IS YOUR MORE WORK CREATED FOR LANDLORDS -- IN SECTION EIGHT SCENARIOS THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN ON SECTION EIGHT SCENARIOS FOR PURPOSES OF MAINTAINING THE PROPERTY SO ON AND SO FORTH. IF THE COUNTY DIDN'T HAVE AN ANNUAL INSPECTION PROCESS THEN THEY THE DOCTOR PROCESS WOULD BE IN PLACE YESTERDAY IF THEY WERE OTHERWISE RUN SUBJECT TO IT WITHOUT PUBLIC FUNDS ARE BEING USED I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE MAKE SURE THE SINCE PUBLIC FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO COVER THE VOUCHER. THAT WE'VE DETERMINED THAT THERE IS A BASE LEVEL OF OF OF SAFETY IT'S REQUIREMENTS SO. I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE THAT THERE IS AN INSPECTION ASSOCIATED -- WITH WITH WITH WITH SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS YET AND THAT'S WHAT I'M I WAS GETTING TO THE THE DIFFERENCE PROPERTY RIGHTS. DISCUSSION IT WAS PUT FORWARD BY -- SENATOR MOMENT AGO IS THERE A DIFFERENT STANDARD. FOR THOSE THAT MAINTAIN SECTION EIGHT PROPERTIES AS OPPOSED TO NON SECTION EIGHT PROPERTIES. YES THERE IS. YES AND AND I GUESS THE ARGUMENT I'M I'M GOING. FURTHER TO SAY ON THIS IS AND I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT BECAUSE AS A LAND OWNER LORD YOU ARE ACCEPTING -- PUBLIC BENEFIT FOR YOUR PROPERTY. I AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT -- THAT THERE IS A STANDARD THAT WE EXPECT THAT YOU MAINTAIN YOUR PROPERTY FOR THE PLEASURE AN OPPORTUNITY RECEIVING PUBLIC BENEFIT. THANK YOU. SENATOR STERN THE MANAGER. THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGH EXPLANATION CENTER MITCHELL OF THE LEGISLATION -- IS THERE ANY IS THERE ANY DISPUTE COMING FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE AUTHORS CENTRAL PREMISE THAT THIS IS NOT A MANDATE I GET I GET THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF INSPECTION PROCESS AND THE TIMING BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR HERE. THE WAY I READ THE BILL THE WAY THE ARGUES OFF AUTHORS ARE ARGUED THE BILL. IT SEEMS LIKE IT YOU'RE STILL IN THAT THREE RENTER POTENTIAL RENTER SCENARIO YOU'RE NOT BOUND TO ACCEPT THE SECTION EIGHT OVER THE OTHERS AS LONG AS IT'S NOT. SOLELY ON THAT BASIS IS THEIR DISPUTE ABOUT THE MANDATE QUESTION -- OF WHAT I WOULD SAY SENATORS THAT -- IF YOU HAVE AN OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE APPLICANT. AND THERE THEY HAVE A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS IS FINE THERE OTHERWISE THEY'RE ELIGIBLE. YOU WOULD HAVE TO YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT TENDED AND THEREFORE BE FORCED INTO THAT HAVE CONTRACT -- I MEAN IT'S ONLY ONE ADDED IF THERE IS ONLY ONE APPLICANT I MEAN I I I I SUPPOSE IF YOU IF YOU RECEIVE THREE APPLICATIONS AT THE AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. EVEN TWO OR EVEN -- TO THEN YES YOU YOU COULD YOU COULD MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. THANK YOU VERY COULD MOVE THE BILL THE APPROPRIATE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SEEING NON -- APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND THE CONCERNS THAT ARE EXPRESSED -- A IS I UNDERSTAND IT THE STANDARDS OF HABITABILITY ARE NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT BUT WITH THE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER THEY ARE ANNUALLY INSPECTED. WHICH I THINK ONE CAN ARGUE IS A GOOD THING -- WITH HOUSING SO -- THE IT OBVIOUSLY. THIS BILL -- THE PROVIDES. MUCH NEEDED ACCESS TO HOUSING REMARK REMEMBERING OF COURSE THAT SECTION EIGHT HOUSING IS PUBLIC FUNDING -- AND SO THERE ARE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PLACED ON IT AS WELL AND THAT IF YOU HAVE. OTHER THAN AGAIN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE SEEKING THIS UNIT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO AGREE. IT IS TRUST IF THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO IS SEEKING. THAT HOUSING AND YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO COMES FORWARD WITH A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER YOU CANNOT TURN THEM AWAY. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. WITH THAT THERE IS A MOTION OF AND WE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU CLOSE AND THEY WILL TAKE ABOUT. I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION THAT ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD. SIMPLY AGAIN CALLED THE LOS ANGLES TIMES EDITORIAL -- BY FAILING THAT VOUCHERS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE FIND STABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY OF THEIR CHOICE NEAR GOOD JOBS AND QUALITY SCHOOLS. BLANKET NO SECTION EIGHT BANDS AND SUB THREE DISCRIMINATION A ROAD THE CORE PREMISE OF THIS PROGRAM. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT VITAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS WORK BUT THE STATE'S NEEDIEST RESIDENTS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE ABOUT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU OUR MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE TWO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HIGH JACKSON I BORDERS. ALLEN. ALLEN HI CABALLERO. CAREER I JONES.

AND SENATOR LEYVA YOU ARE. PATIENT HAVE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY AND IN FACT THERE'S NOBODY AHEAD OF YOU AND I WAS GOING TO CALL ON YOU ANYWAY. YOUR PATIENCE IS BEING REAL WAR WAS GOING TO BE REWARDED BUT IN FACT IS THE ONLY ONE SITTING HERE -- WAITING -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION ON FILE ITEM. SEVENTEEN SB FIVE SIXTY FOUR WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND JUST WAIT UNTIL WE CLEAR THE ROMAN HAVE THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR [inaudible] YOU COULD ALL RIGHT IF WE COULD JUST THE CLOSE THE DOOR. SENATOR LEYVA GOOD AFTERNOON TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES TEACHER IF WE COULD. TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH CHAPTER YOU PRESENT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THINK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL IS MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU SO WE'RE LOOKING AT PAGE THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED ON PAGE SEVEN COMMENT. NUMBER. ONE BRECHT VERY GOOD. SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY FOUR HAS TWO MAIN COMPONENTS ONE ESTABLISH CLEAR PARAMETERS OF WRITTEN CONSENT IN ORDER TO DEPICT A PERSON AS PERFORMING IN THE NUDE OR IS ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY. TO PROVIDE VICTIMS OF NON CONSENSUAL DIGITALLY PRODUCED SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL A CIVIL CAUSE OF ACTION TO SUE BAD ACTORS IN OPEN COURT FOR ECONOMIC. REPUTATIONAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM. MEMBERS NEW DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ALLOW CONTENT CREATORS TO MANIPULATE IMAGES TO DEPICT INDIVIDUALS AS ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY OR IS PERFORMING IN THE NUDE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT OR PARTICIPATION. FILMMAKERS CAN ALSO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY IN MAINSTREAM CONTENT TO DEPICT ACTOR OR ACTRESS AS PERFORMING IN THE NUDE OR AS ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITHOUT MEANINGFUL CONSENT. THIS FORM OF DIGITAL DOUBLING DOUBLING CAN CAUSE ENORMOUS HARM. EVEN THOUGH THE AUDIO VISUAL WORK DOES NOT SHOW THE PERFORMERS ACTUAL INTIMATE BODY PARTS. IN MOST PRODUCTION THE MOST EXCUSE ME IN POST PRODUCTION THE MAKERS NOW HAVE TOOLS TO REMOVE UNDERWEAR. CREATE A DIGITAL REPLICA OF THE PERSON OR TO REPLACE THE HEAD OF A PERFORMER ON THE REAL BODY OF ANOTHER. UNFORTUNATELY SOME PERFORMERS HAVE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN FILM PRODUCTION. AND THE PROBLEM WILL ONLY INTESA INTENSIFY AS THIS TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE ADVANCED AND FREELY ACCESSIBLE. THIS FORM OF ONLINE SEXUAL ABUSE OF INDIVIDUALS MOSTLY WOMEN IS VERY TROUBLING. THERE ARE PRESENTLY OVER FIVE THOUSAND NON CONSENSUAL PORN SITES PORN VIDEOS BEING MONETIZE ON PORN WEBSITES AND THE POTENTIAL PERPETRATORS AND VICTIMS CAN REALLY BE ANYONE. SO IT GOES FAR BEYOND IMPACTING JUST THOSE WORKING IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. AN EX BOYFRIEND A FORMER BOSS AN ANGRY STUDENT OR ANYONE WITH AN AXE TO GRIND CAM PERPETRATE THIS TYPE OF ONLINE ABUSE AND EVEN WORSE MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR OBTAINING MEANINGFUL CONSENT FOR DIGITALLY PRODUCED SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL. IT IS A BASIC EXPECTATION THAT AN INDIVIDUAL SIGN A DULY CONSIDERED NEGOTIATED NUDITY WRITER BEFORE BEING DEPICTED IN THIS WAY IN ANY MOTION PICTURE. IT IS A SERIOUS DECISION FOR ANY PERFORMER TO DO A NUDE SCENE AS IT WILL FOREVER AFFECT THEIR HOME LIFE CAREER PUBLIC PERCEPTION FAN BASE OR EVEN THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. ANY SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL SHOULD BE CAREFULLY SCRIPTED AND GREET UPON IN ADVANCE. IT IS WRONG TO AMBUSH A PERFORMER WITH A NUDITY RIDER ON SET AWAY FROM AN AUTHORIZED PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OR THEIR LABOR UNION. THESE LAST MINUTE WRITERS ARE A PROBLEM IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND ANY APPLICABLE LAW SHOULD LEGALLY PROHIBIT THEM UNLESS CERTAIN SAFEGUARDS ARE SATISFIED. MEMBERS SB FIVE SIXTY FOUR WILL ADDRESS THE SERIOUS ISSUE BY CREATING A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR ESTABLISHING CONSENT FOR DIGITALLY PRODUCED SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL. I WOULD PROVIDE CIVIL REMEDIES WHEN CONSENT HAS NOT BEEN OBTAINED. HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY IS SHANE GUTMANN MICHELLE HEARD WAS SAG AFTRA. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES EACH IF YOU WOULD. MADAM CHAIR SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF SAG AFTER THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND ALSO -- THE TEAMSTERS WHO SUPPORT THEIR FELLOW UNION MEMBERS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AMID A FOR MY TIME BECAUSE WE HAD ANOTHER WITNESS TRAVEL UP -- SOMEONE FROM THE TALENT AGENTS SO -- WITHOUT ALL THE OFFENDED OVER TO MICHELLE THANK YOU. HI. I'M MICHELLE HEARD AND I AM AN ACTOR. AND THE NATIONAL BOARD MEMBER OF SAG ACTOR. I'VE BEEN ACTING FOR THIRTY YEARS WHICH IS HARD TO SAY OUT LOUD -- IN FACT I HAVE MY NEW JOB WE WOULD A FULL MAYES. THANK YOU HI I LOVE YOU NOW -- IN FACT MY NEW GIVE THEM DOING RIGHT NOW WHICH I STAR TRACK WITH THE PATRICK STEWART GAVE ME THE DAY ALSO THAT COULD COME HERE AND TALK ON THIS. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO MAKE MY LIVING AS AN ACTOR SOLELY. AS AN ACTOR FOR THOSE ENTIRE YEARS AND THE REASON I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE I HAVE BUILT A CAREER. AS AN ACTOR. BECAUSE THIS IS MY JOB. THIS IS MY CAREER MY CAREER IS GIVING ME MY LIVELIHOOD. THIS. IS MY BUSINESS. FOR ALL INTENDED PURPOSES THIS. IS MY PRODUCT. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU GUYS TODAY TO SPEAK ON THIS CRUCIAL BILL AND I THINK YOU. SENATOR CONNIE LAY BEFORE OFFERING THIS BILL AND FOR THIS COMMITTEE. TO GIVE US THIS TIME. SB FIVE SIX FOUR ADDRESS IS A SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING PROBLEM IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT ACTORS. PARTICULARLY FEMALE ACTORS. NEW TECHNOLOGIES ALLOW ONTENT CREATORS TO ALTER A PERSON'S IMAGE TO DEPICT THEM THAT INDIVIDUAL AS ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY OR TO APPEAR AS PERFORMING IN THE NUDE WHEN NEITHER ACTUALLY OCCURRED. THIS SO CALLED DEEP FAKE TECHNOLOGY IS OFTEN USED AS A TOOL. OF EXPLOITATION AND HARASSMENT ON THE INTERNET HOWEVER IT CAN BE USED BY MAINSTREAM FILMMAKERS AS WELL. FILMMAKERS WITHOUT THE MEANINGFUL CONSENT OF THE ACTORS INVOLVED. CAN DIGITALLY ALTER A SCENE TO SHOW MORE NUDITY. OR SEXUALLY EXPLICIT AXE IN POST PRODUCTION. THIS CAN BE INCREDIBLY DAMAGING TO A REPUTATION AND A CAREER. ONCE THE DIGITALLY ALTERED FILLMORE IMAGES OUT THERE IN THE WORLD IT'S NEGATIVE IMPACT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. AND THE DAMAGE. CAN BE LONG LASTING [inaudible] EVEN PERMANENT. FOR MY FELLOW ACTORS. THIS TYPE OF NON CONSENSUAL DIGITAL DOUBLING IS AT ITS VERY CORE EXTREME WORKER EXPLOITATION. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAW THE THE LAW HASN'T EVOLVED AS FAST AS TECHNOLOGY. TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF THING FROM OCCURRING THIS IS WHY. WE ARE WORKING SO HARD TO MAKE SB SIX FIVE SIX FOUR AND OTHER SIMILAR PROPOSE LAWS AROUND THE COUNTRY. A LEGAL REALITY [inaudible] IF ENACTED. THIS BILL WILL TRULY HELP PROTECT. FARMERS AND OTHERS. POTENTIALLY HARMED BY THIS TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDING A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR CONSENT AND CIVIL REMEDIES TO COMPENSATE THE VICTIM WE'RE CONSENT. ISN'T OBTAINED. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS BILL IS IT'S NOT DOESN'T JUST PROTECT PERFORMERS BUT ALL. CALIFORNIANS WHO FALL PREY TO THESE HARMFUL PRACTICES ONLINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT NEXT WITNESS PLEASE HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JACKIE -- LIPSKY AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF TALENT AGENTS IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE SIXTY FOUR WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A CIVIL CAUSE OF ACTION. AGAINST NON CONSENSUAL DIGITALLY PRODUCED SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIALS THE ASSOCIATION OF TALENT AGENTS OR ATA IS A LOS ANGELES BASED NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION COMPRISED OF OVER. ONE HUNDRED TALENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA AT ACE MEMBER AGENCIES REPRESENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKING ARTISTS INCLUDING ACTORS IN FILM TELEVISION RADIO COMMERCIAL MODELING AND OTHER ENTERTAINMENT ENTERPRISES WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING OUR ARTISTS CLIENTS. IN AN INCREASINGLY TECHNOLOGICALLY COMPLEX WORLD WHERE ARTISTS REPUTATIONS CAREERS AND QUITE FRANKLY THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO PRIVACY CAN BE THREATENED BY UNSCRUPULOUS CONTENT CREATORS AT THE CLICK OF A MOUSE. SB FIVE SIX FOUR RESPONSE TO THE RISE OF THE SPECIFIC ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED TECHNOLOGY COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS DEEP FAKE **** IT IS USED TO PRODUCE OR ALTER NON CONSENSUAL DIGITIZE SEX SCENES. AND NEWT PERFORMANCES AND MOTION PICTURES THIS LEGISLATION WOULD UPDATE THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE TO PROTECT VICTIMS AGAINST THIS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FORM OF SEXUAL ABUSE. BY PROVIDING FOR COMPREHENSIVE DAMAGES AND REMEDIES THAT WILL TURN DETERRENCE SUCH REPREHENSIBLE PERPETRATORS OF DEEP FAKE BERNARD GRAFFITI ACCOUNTABLE AND PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AGAINST ONLINE SEXUAL ABUSE. FOR THESE REASONS EIGHTY A STRONGLY SUPPORT SB FIVE SIX FOUR AND THINGS SENATOR LABOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION I ALSO WANT TO REGISTER THE SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA I OUT SEE COUNSEL AND THE ENTERTAINMENT UNIONS COALITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JACKSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND WHAT HE PROP WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION -- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS WE HAVE HAD SOME WHAT I THINK ARE VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. OUR CONCERNS AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ON THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD. WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THE PROBLEM THAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS ARE REALLY WITH THE BILL. AS WRITTEN ON THAT IT COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO SB. FIVE SIXTY FOUR RELIES ON A NUMBER OF BROAD DEFINITIONS THAT HAVE THE PTENTIAL TO CREATE VERY SERIOUS LIABILITY. FOR ACTIONS THAT THE BILL DOES NOT APPEAR. TO BE INTENDED TO TARGET SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE BILL'S DEFINITION OF DISCLOSE WHICH TRIGGERS LIABILITY UNDER THE LAW. INCLUDES TRANSFERRING AND MAKING AVAILABLE ONE OF THESE VIDEOS THAT COULD INCLUDE SOMETHING LIKE. A VIDEO THAT SHARED WITH THE REPORTER IF THE REPORT OF AN SHOWS THAT TO THEIR EDITOR TO DECIDE IS THIS SOMETHING WE WANT TO DO A STORY ABOUT. THEY'VE NOW TRANSFERRED ABOUT VIDEO THEY'VE MADE AVAILABLE TO SOMEONE ELSE AND THAT COULD TRIGGER LIABILITY UNDER THE LAW. IN ADDITION THE BILL'S DEFINITION OF SEXUAL CONDUCT COULD BE READ TO INCLUDE AS SOMETHING AS INNOCUOUS AS A POPSICLE. TO BE CLEAR WE DON'T THINK IT WAS THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO COVER THESE SITUATIONS AND TO CREATE LIABILITY BUT WE DO NONE THE LESS BELIEVE THAT THE BILL. DOES OPEN THE DOOR TO THOSE CLAIMS. IN ADDITION THE LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF SB. FIVE SIX FOUR THE MPA IS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT ALLOW FOR THE STUDENT AUTONOMOUS COURT FILINGS AND THE CLOSING OF COURT RECORDS. THE PUBLIC ACCESS WITHOUT AN INDIVIDUALIZED CONSIDERATION OF THE FAX -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT ON THIS THEY FOUND THAT STRICT SCRUTINY AND ALSO SHOULD BE APPLIED -- WHEN THEY'RE ISSUES OF ACCESS TO JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS ARE NOT RULE HAS BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA RULE OF COURT TWO POINT FIVE FIFTY WHICH ALLOWS THE COURT TO SEAL RECORDS -- UPON A SHOWING OF CERTAIN FACTORS. SO WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID WE APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS OF THE AUTHOR TO WORK WITH US ON THESE -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK OU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MANY TWEETERS ANYBODY WHO'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE BUT CERTAINLY HAS CONCERNS. ALL RIGHT OF A WILL BRING THIS -- TO THE DYESS WILL START WITH CENTER MONNING FALL BY CENTER AND ON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ONLY THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD FOR THE WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE. SO IS I READ THIS IT CREATES. A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO BRING A CIVIL SUIT. DOES IT ESTABLISH ANY CRIMINAL LIABILITY. IT DOES NOT. THROUGH THE CHAIR THIS BILL DOES NOT ESTABLISH KAMAL LIABILITY ALTHOUGH THERE IS -- LEGISLATION MOVING THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY RIGHT NOW THAT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE THAT IF IT WAS ENACTED YES I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE IN. CONSCIOUS EGREGIOUS. ABUSES HAS BEEN DESCRIBED -- THE REMEDY SHOULDN'T JUST BE CIVIL I MEAN IN SUPPORT OF OF THIS TODAY -- IN AS WAS POINTED OUT BY THE WITNESSES WELL. MAYBE THE FOCUS IS THE EXPLOITATION OF PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC VIEW ACTORS ACTRESSES -- FILM INDUSTRY BUT I THINK THERE EXAMPLES ALSO OF JUST. ABUSE THE INTERNET ABUSE OF BOWLING OF THE DISGRUNTLED. PARTNER -- THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF POSSIBILITIES -- DO THE INTERNET COMPANIES THAT MIGHT KERRY THIS HOW DO THEY FIT IN IN TRYING TO CONTROL IF YOU'RE GOING TO COURT TO GET A T. RO. THE DAMAGE IN SOME WAYS HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE SO ONE OF YOUR REMEDIES IS HAD A YOU. CALCULATE THE DAMAGE TO A CAREER TO AN IMAGE -- SO I GUESS THAT'S ONE QUESTION HOW DO YOU CALCULATE DAMAGES AND HOW DO YOU GET IT REMOVED. IS THIS BILL PROVIDE THE TOOLS OF THEIR THEIR IT REMAINS ON THE ON THE FIRST QUESTION THE DAMAGES ARE EITHER THE ECONOMIC AND OTHER DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE VICTIM. THERE'S ALSO STATUTORY DAMAGES IN THOSE INSTANCES WHEN IT'S DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT WHEN A CAREER IS SO DAMAGED. HOW YOU DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL ECONOMIC DAMAGES THERE'S -- A STATUTORY RANGE OF DAMAGES IN THE BILL -- IN TERMS OF THE SECOND QUESTION ABOUT PREVENTING HARM AND AND AND HOW TO GET IT REMOVED THERE IS A PROVISION FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. IN THE BILL OF COURSE IF YOU SHOT THAT RELIEF YOU'DHAVE. TO PROVE ALL THE THINGS YOU NEED TO PROVE UNDER EXISTING LAW IN ORDER TO GET THAT. RELIEF AND IT'S A PRETTY HIGH BAR AS YOU KNOW I MEAN IF YOU GET THE RELIEF FROM A COURT I IMAGINE ONCE IT'S OUT. EXAM REELING IT BACK IN RIGHT RIGHT AND THAT'S AND THAT'S REALLY THE POINT OF OF HAVING THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN THERE ARE SAFE IN SOME INSTANCES WHEN WE CAN CATCH IT. TO PREVENT IT FROM ACTUALLY GETTING OUT IN THE WORLD BEFORE THE DAMAGE IS DONE. THEN I HEARD THE REFERENCE THIS IS DESCRIBED AS DEEP FAKE TECHNOLOGY. THIS WON'T GET CONFUSED WITH FAKE NEWS WELL IT. ABSOLUTELY NOT NO. PLEASE LET HER CALIFORNIA THANK YOU -- THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER MONEY SENATOR ALAN. I JUST KNEW WITH WITH RESPECT OPPOSITION ARGUMENT AYE AYE. YOU KNOW I HEAR YOU. ON THIS ISSUE OF THE MEETING SOMETHING BUT IT REALLY IT DOES SAY IS IT'S GOT TO BE SEXUALLY EXPLICIT YOU KNOW SO -- SO I I UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD BE A LOGICAL EXTREME BUT BUT IT THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY FOR THIS BILL TO COVER THAT SITUATION NOW. I'M I THINK OUR CONCERN IS JUST WITH THE WAY THE DEFINITIONS ARE WRITTEN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE'S A DEFINITION FOR SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL THAT BEEN INCORPORATES. THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL CONDUCT WHICH HAS A WHOLE LIST OF EXAMPLES -- IN ONE OF THOSE INCLUDES. OBJECTS BEING INSERTED IN THE MOUTH AND SO WE JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AGAIN I DON'T THINK WHERE THE INTENTION OF THE AUTHOR THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE CARVE THOSE AND SO THAT THIS BILL IS ACCOMPLISHING WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO ACCOMPLISH BUT NOT. ROPING IN -- OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THAT REALLY AREN'T -- RELEVANT TO WHAT THE BILL'S TRYING TO TARGET. THE MAN I MEAN THROUGH THE CHECKING ASKED AUTHORED IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN WORK ON YEAH I WAS GONNA SAY AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WE THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN AGREE ON AND AND GET TO EITHER -- SUPPORT OR AT LEAST. NEUTRAL BUT YEAH WE'LL KEEP WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION IF I CAN JUST AFFIRM THAT THE I I THINK YEAH. THEY'RE JUST SAYING THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER WILL CONTINUE TO AND IF FOR FOR CONSOLATION. AND SUCH ON PAGE -- THREE THE DEPICTION HOUSE THE RESULT FROM AN INTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE I MEAN THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF PROTECTIONS THAT. HAVE BEEN -- ANTICIPATED BUT CLEARLY -- WHEN IT COMES TO THESE FIRST AMENDMENT TYPE ISSUES AND DEALING WITH NEWSPAPERS REPORTING THERE'S A? A CERTAIN HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY AND I THINK THE BALANCE IS SOMETHING THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO WORK AND SHE WAS SAYING IT THE WE WOULD BE AN INTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF SOME PLAYFUL. VIDEO OF SOMEONE THE NUMBER OF POPSICLE OR SOMETHING BUT I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING YOU GUYS HAVE TO KIND OF SHE WON A LITTLE BIT WORK. KEEP WORKING MY ART YEAH I THINK THERE WILL BE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM MIGHT I THINK YOU'RE. YOU'RE NOT IN DIFFERENT PAGES HERE YOU'RE JUST NEEDING. FOR SURE ALL RIGHT DOES SENATOR BORCHERS AND THEN WILL -- EXCEPT THE MOTION AND ASK YOU TO CLOSE. YOU KNOW IT UNTIL ON THIS CAME FORWARD I I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS WAS AS BAD AS IT AS IT SOUNDS -- SO I REALLY DON'T HAVE TOO MANY QUESTIONS MORE OF A COMMENT THAT. INTUITIVELY I WOULD THINK AN ACTOR AND ACTRESS ANYONE THAT PUTS THEMSELVES OUT THERE IN THAT INDUSTRY [inaudible] SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO OWN THEIR LIKENESS. BUT IF THEY DON'T THAT. SOMEONE ELSE'S OWNERSHIP OF THAT LIKENESS SHOULD BE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF HOW IT WAS ORIGNALLY. CONVEYED -- IN TRANSACTED -- BECAUSE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT. IS A BASTARDIZATION OF WHATEVER HAD BEEN OCCURRING IN THE ENTERTAINMENT OR IN THE ART PRODUCT. WHATEVER IT IS SO I THINK -- AND IF THIS IS BAD AS IT SOUNDS IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU KNOW A WORK ON THE DEFINITIONAL -- ISSUES -- TO FIND THAT COMMON GROUND THEM ALWAYS A FIRM BELIEVER -- THAT REASONABLE MINDS CAN COME TOGETHER BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT SENATOR THANK YOU TO WE HAVE A MOTION. MOVED BY SENATOR MORNING I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR TESTIFYING AND THE IT'S A REMINDER TO YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT ACTORS. YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S VERY DIFFERENT LIGHT SOMETIMES BUT THIS IS YOUR WORK.

YOUR REMINDER THAT FACT IN THE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THIS CAN BE ABUSED AND WE'VE SEEN. WE'VE SEEN IN A DOZEN DOZENS OF INSTANCES WHERE THIS KIND OF ABUSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND A KIND OF BEHAVIOR -- SEEMS TO HAVE. SOME SOME LAKES IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS UP AS IT IS ELSEWHERE BUT CERTAINLY IT HAS A TREMENDOUS IMPACT. OF BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC NATURE OF THE WORK YOU DO SO.

IN CALIFORNIA A DOES THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IS OUR PROTECTION ADVOCACY AGENCY AND THE SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. SO SB THREE NINETY EIGHT A WHAT WE INTEND TO DO WITH THIS IS UPDATE STATE LAW. REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY AGENCY TO CONFORM. CALIFORNIA LAW THE FEDERAL PROTECTION ADVOCACY AGENCY REGULATIONS THERE WERE ADOPTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SO IT'S IT'S TO CONFORM ARC STATE WITH OUR FEDERAL LAW -- THIS BILL ALSO THE SECOND THING IS THAT IT DOES IS TO SPECIFICALLY CLARIFY. THAT THE MEANING OF CORN QUOTE FACILITY OR PROGRAM. INCLUDES OF FACILITY USED TO HOUSE OR DETAIN NON CITIZENS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CIVIL IMMIGRATION CUSTODY. ARE SUSTAINING THIS ACCESS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF A RECENT REPORT BY DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. THAT REPORT COVERED THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND OTHER DISABILITIES. IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION AT G. E. O. THE GROUPS ARE THE LAND TOLL. ICE PROCESSING CENTER IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. AMONG OTHER FINDINGS THAT REPORT. FOUND THAT OTHER LANDELL HAD INADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND MEDICAL CARE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. WHICH WERE MADE ALL THE WORSE BY THE FACILITIES COUNTER THERAPEUTIC CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES. IT ALSO FOUND THAT THE G. E. O. GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER REPORTS DATA ON THE NUMBER OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS THAT OCCUR AT ON THE LAWN. TO WITH ME AND WILL SERVE AS OUR TWO WITNESSES ARE CREE CHILD OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND ON THE DAY I LEAVE IT OUT OF CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON.

TO GO INTO ICE -- FACILITIES -- TO INVESTIGATE THE CONDITIONS WITHIN -- THOSE WE HAVE HISTORICALLY CODIFIED THIS FEDERAL LAW IN -- IN STATE STATUTE AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CODIFIES THE MORE RECENT SET OF REGULATIONS FROM -- TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IN TWO OF THE STATE LAW SO THAT WE CAN FORM STATE LAW -- CONSISTENT WITH -- WITH THE THE FEDERAL LAW AND AS NOTED -- IT DOES ALSO -- CLARIFY AND CONFIRM THAT -- WE DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO INTO -- IMMIGRATION FACILITIES ICE FACILITY SPECIFICALLY AND WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN -- QUITE ACTIVE OF RECENT IN GOING INTO THOSE FACILITIES AND CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS IN THE CONDITIONS -- NOT ONLY ADELANTO BUT YELLOW WHERE THE YOUTH HER HEALTH -- ORANGE -- AS WELL AND SO WE WOULD URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS ENJOY RIVERA PRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. SB THREE NINETY EIGHT WOULD ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DETAINED AND IMMIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES AND HAVE MENTAL HEALTH -- DISABILITIES -- HAVE THE SERVICESTHAT THEY REQUIRE INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND LEGAL SERVICES. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE NINETY EIGHT AND IN PARTICULAR ONE CRITICAL PROVISION OF THE BILL WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF A FACILITY OR A PROGRAM. TO SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE IMMIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS TO INCREASE OVERSIGHT OF IMMIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES -- IN PARTICULAR WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB ONE OH THREE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AB ONE OH THREE DIRECTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO MONITOR AND PRODUCE REPORTS ON THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE FOUND IN DETENTION FACILITIES. AND IN FEBRUARY THE AG RELEASED THEIR FIRST REPORT. AND THAT REPORT THEY NOTED THAT -- INCIDENCES OF SUICIDE AND DEATH AND DETENTION FACILITIES ARE AT ALL TIME HIGH. AND DETAINEES OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY REQUIRE. FEDERAL OFFICIALS REPORT THAT APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DETAINED AND-NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DO NOT GET ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES. AMONG THE MOST TRAGIC CASES THAT MISTER JOSE. ANTONIO FRANKEL GONZALEZ WHO IS AN IMMIGRANT AND WAS DETAINED -- AND HE WAS NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO TO HIS MENTAL DISABILITY AND MISTER FRANKEL GONZALEZ WAS DETAINED FOR FIVE YEARS WITH NO HEARING OR A LAWYER. AND HIS FAMILY WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE HIM DURING THAT TIME. THIS CASE RESULTED IN WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE FRANCO RULING WHICH REQUIRES LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR ALL -- DETAINEES WERE MENTALLY IMPAIRED. HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE NO ONE TO VOUCH FOR THE CONDITIONS OF VETERAN SIDE OF THESE FACILITIES AND SB THREE NINETY EIGHT COMBINED WITH OTHER STATE PROTECTIONS. WHAT ENSURE? INSTANCES OF ABUSE WHEN I'M SURE BUT INSTANCES OF ABUSE AND PROBABLE CAUSE FOR NEGLECT ARE HANDLED IN A TIMELY MANNER. FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. MOTION BY SENATOR Y.

BURGER ADAM CHAIR FLOORS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT SB -- FOR THIRTY FOUR WHICH WILL PLACE INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES IN THE DAVIS STIRLING ACT FOR MANAGERS AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES TO FOLLOW WHEN TRANSFERRING ASSOCIATION DOCUMENTS. HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS OR H. AWAYS ARE COMMONLY KNOWN ARE SELF GOVERNING DWELLINGS THAT SHARE COMMON SPACES AND AMENITIES. AND REPRESENT ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE HOUSING STOCK IN CALIFORNIA. H. AWAY IS COMMONLY HIRE A PROPERTY MANAGER TO HANDLE THEIR DAY TO DAY AFFAIRS AND KEEP RECORDS. THESE RECORDS INCLUDE EVERYTHING FROM MEMBERSHIP LISTS TO BANK STATEMENTS THE BOARD MEETINGS MINUTES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CCAR'S IN ALL THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS WITH H. O. AGE. THESE RECORDS ARE THE PROPERTY OF THE ASSOCIATION. BUT ARE NORMALLY KEPT IN THE PROPERTY THE MANAGERS POSSESSION. WHEN AN H. AWARE OF -- ELECTS TO CHANGE MANAGERS PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSFER OF THESE DOCUMENTS CAN ARISE. AN H. AWAY CANNOT AFFECTING PERFORM ALL ITS DUTIES WITHOUT THE TRANSITION OF THE DOCUMENTS FROM ONE OLD MANAGER TO THE NEW MANAGER. AN EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW THERE IS NO TIMELINE OR PROCEDURE GOVERNING THE RETURN OF THE TRANSFER OF THESE RECORDS. AND THAT IS WHERE MY BILL COMES INTO PLAY. SB FOUR THIRTY FOUR WILL PLACE AN INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES IN THE DAVIS STIRLING ACT FOR MANAGERS AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES TO FOLLOW WHEN TRANSFERRING ASSOCIATION DOCUMENTS. SPECIFICALLY. SB FOUR THIRTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE AN H. AWAY MANAGER. WHOSE CONTRACT HAS BEEN TERMINATED TO HAND OVER THE H. ALWAYS PROPERTY AND RECORDS TO THE H. AWAY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. OF THE REQUEST OR THIRTY DAYS WITHIN TERMINATION DATE. SB THIRTY FORMA BORROWS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS CODE OF ETHICS AND WILL CREATE A UNIFORM STANDARD FOR ALL COMMUNITY MANAGERS IN CALIFORNIA. CONCERNS WERE RAISED IN SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE. THAT EXEMPTIONS IN THIS BILL WERE TOO BROAD. AND THE FORMAT IN WHICH THE DOCUMENTS WERE TO BE TRANSFERRED WITH UNDEFINED. WE'VE MADE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THESE REASONS I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE CONCERNS. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. FOR THEIR WORK -- IN THIS BILL. AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND ASK FOR AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS I HAVE LIEU OF LOUIS BROWN LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION INSTITUTE.

THIS PRACTICE WILL CODIFY BEST PRACTICES IN THE INDUSTRY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN SUPPORT. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARJORIE MURRAY FROM THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW. AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR RETIRED AMERICANS I I'M NOT SRE I'VE EVER MENTIONED. BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE THAT I ACTUALLY LIVE IN HAND ONE OF THE OLDEST ASSOCIATIONS IN CALIFORNIA FORMED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTEEN SPECIFICALLY TO ENFORCE RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY COVENANTS. SO I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE WE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE HOUSING COMMITTEE ACT WHICH COMMITMENTS WERE MADE. TO OF CLEAN UP SOME OF THE EXEMPTIONS WERE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMENDMENT TO BE TAKEN IN COMMITTEE TODAY THAT IT LOOKS LIKE EXEMPTIONS CLOSED IN DIFFERENT WORDS. THAT THE PROPERTY MANAGER IS EXCUSED FROM PROVIDING RECORDS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST OR DESTROYED DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES OUTSIDE THE MANAGING AGENTS CONTROL. SO THAT LANGUAGE STILL IS OF CONCERN ALONG WITH THE PROVISION. THAT THE MANAGING AGENT DOESN'T HAVE TO PRODUCE RECORDS EVEN UNDER COURT ORDER UNDER SUBPOENA. THAT WAS NOT AN ISSUE ADDRESSED IN SENATE HOUSING BUT I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE HERE. THE ISSUE OF SUBPOENA I THINK IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. ACTUALLY I WOULD LIKE AT THIS POINT. TO YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME. TO A STATEMENT PREPARED BY. ARE THE VICE PRESIDENT OF A SAN MATTEO HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION WHICH WAS THE VICTIM. I ONE OF THE BIGGEST SWINDLES IN THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION UNIVERSE IN CALIFORNIA -- HE VERY GENEROUSLY TOOK THE TIME TO LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS AND HAS PREPARED. AND EXECUTED STATEMENT FOR THE COMMITTEE WHICH HE HAS ASKED ME TO READ. DEAR SENATOR JACKSON AND COMMITTEE AS A LONG TIME RESIDENT AND I KNOW YOU'LL TIMELY SENATOR JACKSON. AS A LONG TIME HOPE H. O. A RESIDENT AND CURRENT BOARD VICE PRESIDENT I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT SB. SEVEN FIVE FOUR THE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU MY ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE WAS THE VICTIM OF A TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR EMBEZZLEMENT SCHEME ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. THE SAN MATTEO DISTRICT ATTORNEY PROSECUTED ARE PROPERTY MANAGER. AND HER CO CONSPIRATOR WHO ARE NOW IN STATE PRISON FOR THEIR CRIMES. IN ADEQUATE RECORD KEEPING AND BLACKS OVERSIGHT CONTRIBUTED TO THE PERPETUATION OF THIS FRAUD WHICH WENT ON FOR YEARS BEFORE BEING DISCOVERED. IN OUR CASE RECORDS WERE KEPT IN SUCH A HAPHAZARD MANNER. THAT AND ONCE THE FRAUD WAS DISCOVERED THE MANAGER DESTROYED MANY RECORDS KEPT IN A SECRET LOCATION. AT THE JUDGE STATED AT SENTENCING THE AMOUNT OF THE ACTUAL LOSS TO THE ASSOCIATION WAS LIKELY MCH GREATER THAN THE TWO POINT EIGHT FOUR MILLION. THE DESTROYED RECORDS MAY HAVE PROVED THIS THE ASSOCIATION WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT THAT WAS STOLEN. I HAVE TWO MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT SBSEVEN FIVE FOUR SORRY. SORRY SB FOUR THREE FOUR AS THE AMENDED BILL NOW STANDS FIRST BEING THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE RECORDS ARE CREATED STORED AND MAINTAINED. THE SECOND BEING THE RETENTION PERIOD. RECORDS ARE SO VITAL TO ONGOING H. O. A BUSINESS. FRAUD DETECTION TAX RETURN PREPARATION AND H. AWAY BOARD OVERSIGHT. FURTHERMORE THEY MUST BE HELD FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIODS OF TIME. THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE FOR YEARS IN CASE OF A TAX AUDIT. THEREFORE THEY MUST BE PROTECTED FROM LOSS OR DESTRUCTION. MANY H. AWAY MANAGERS OPERATE WITH HIGH LEVELS OF AUTONOMY WHICH EXPOSES THE H. AWAY TO FINANCIAL FRAUD WASTE AND ABUSE. IN THIS DAY AND AGE CRUCIAL RECORDS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE AND BANK RECORDS SHOULD BE MAINTAINED IN ELECTRONIC FORM WITH BACKUP SYSTEMS WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR AN EXEMPTION. FOR LOST RECORDS DUE TO COMPUTER ERRORS OR VIRUSES. FURTHER MORE RECORD SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TO BE CREATED DONE. THANK YOU. GET THE POINT THANK YOU AND IT'S AN YOU HAVE SOME FAIR STATEMENTS I THINK THE CONCERN AND I'M. GOING TO ASK A CENTER ARCHULETA TO RESPOND TO SOME OFTHEM -- OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE SUBPOENAS SUBJECT TO CONTEMPT OF COURT SO THAT ISSUE. SHOULD BE TAKING CARE OF OF RIGHT UP FRONT GOOD IT GOOD AFTERNOON SIR YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND OPPOSITION. MY NAME IS GUS PETRA BOARD PLASTER COUNTY. AND I AM OPPOSITION OF THIS MEASURES WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS ELAINE AND I'M CALLING FROM ALL THE WAY FROM LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA AND MEDINA THEIR RATE. THEN ENTER OUR TO LET THE REALLY QUICK. YOU I'M TAKING MY POWER NO NO NO NO WAY NO CHANCE OF YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION LLENA BUT DRAGON YOUR POST DATED MARINE ETHICAL AND I OPPOSE THANK YOU FOR NOT A GOOD. BILL FOR ME THANK YOU. I'M JACOB MARCUS ALSO FROM LOS ANGELES AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU SIR. I'M MICHAEL WILLIAMS FROM CHOWCHILLA CALIFORNIA AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. I AM LINDA HOBBS FROM SAN PEDRO CALIFORNIA AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. HI MY NAME IS THERESA LUCAS I'M FROM WEST SACRAMENTO YOLO COUNTY HOW IS A FORMER BOARD MEMBER AND HAD TO RESIGN BECAUSE THE DYSFUNCTION AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES. I HAVE ALL THE OF IT THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS PATRICK CORRIGAN I FLIPPED LOS ANGELES OPPOSES. THANK YOU SIR. MY NAME IS ROBIN DISPLAYING KOREAN AND FROM ROSEVILLE. AND AYE OPPOSED THIS BOAT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT OPENING IT UP TO THE FLOOR SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE I THINK THE OBJECTIVE. IS CONTINUITY OF PRESERVATION OF RECORDS. BETWEEN A PRIOR MANAGER IN A SUCCESSOR. BUT I SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IT JUST SEEMS. THIS COULD BE TIGHTENED UP SOME. THERE'S AN EXCEPTION IF THE CLIENT RECORDS HAVE BEEN LOST TO DAMAGE OR ALTERED. WELL SOMEBODY COULD MILITIA SLEEP FEED THEM INTO A PAPER SHREDDER. IN. THE EXCEPTION WOULD APPLY. IT SEEMS IF YOU SIMPLY. WOOD AS THIS MOVES FORWARD. STATE INTENT INCLUDE THERE SHOULD BE. THE SHOULDN'T ALLOW FOR INTENTIONAL DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS IN THE WAY IT READS NOW. AS I READ IT. YOU COULD GET A SUBPOENA YOU CAN GET A REQUEST FROM THE SUCCESSOR MANAGER THAT THEY WANT CERTAIN RECORDS. AND YOU COULD DESTROY THE MALL. AND SAY SORRY THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE. WHERE THEY'VE BEEN ALTERED BECAUSE I POURED COFFEE ALL OVER THEM? YOU CAN DRIVE A TRUCK THROUGH THESE EXCEPTIONS SO -- ALL DEFERRED TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE AUTHOR WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE TO RESPOND WELL LET ME JUST PUT THE QUESTION TO DIRECTLY -- WOULD YOU BE OPEN -- TO TIGHTENING THE UP SO THAT SOMEBODY CAN'T INTENTIONALLY DESTROY RECORDS AND BE PROTECTED YES CENTER THE THE WORD IS INTENTIONAL I I THINK OF IT IT'S A PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND I THINK THAT JUST TO THIS IS TO SEE THAT WHEN THERE'S A TRANSFER OF MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE IN A IN TODAY'S WORLD HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS --ARE OPEN TO BID EVERY FIVE YEARS SEVEN YEARS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE FOR MAINTENANCE AND ECCENTRIC CETERA RIGHT SO THAT ASSOCIATION -- IF THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB. OR THEY HAVE NOT DONE A GOOD OB. WHATEVER RECORDS A HAVE SHOULD TRANSFER TO THE NEW MANAGEMENT COMPANY IS IT'S BASICALLY THAT SIMPLE AND WE'RE SAYING THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN A REGIONAL RUNNER TIME WE THINK THIRTY DAY SHOULD BE THE PINE. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS PERTAIN TO THE THE THE ASSOCIATION ITSELF THERE PRESIDENT ICE PRESIDENT WHATEVER SOME OF THINGS ARE BROUGHT UP THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL. IT JUST TO GO AHEAD AND WHEN IT'S REQUESTED TO GO OVER AND AND I MIGHT POINT OUT. THAT -- THE LENDERS THAT ARE MAKING THE HOMEOWNERS SPECIALLY THAT FIRST TIME HOME BUYER -- WHO THE BANK IS TRYING TO MAKE THE LOAN TO THEY WILL ASK FOR A COPY THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BUDGET IS INTACT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE? THAT THERE'S NO LAWSUIT IN THE HISTORY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IT'S IT'S NOT RENTED -- THAT'S ALL IN THE DOCUMENTS AND IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY HOLD BACK. THIS BILL WOULD SAY LET'S GO AHEAD AND TRANSFER OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE AND AND THEN IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE AUDITED. LET IT BE AUDITED BY THE NEW PERSON SO THEY CAN HAVE QUESTION BUT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER HIT IN AYE AYE TOTAL IMAGE IF JUST FINISH AND I APPRECIATE THAT BEING THE OBJECTIVE. AND IT'S IT'S CLEARLY MINISTERIAL OR CLERICAL IF IF THEY'RE JUST PASSING LONG RECORDS THE PROBLEM IS IF THERE'S BEEN MALFEASANCE IF THERE'S BEEN CORRUPTION OF A PRIOR MANAGEMENT COMPANY. HAS DIVERTED FUNDS OR WHATEVER. THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY THOSE RECORDS AND NOT PASS THE MINE IN THE USE THE EXEMPTION CITED HERE. AS THE RECORDS WERE ALTERED THE RECORDS. AND THE KEY WORD THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WHICH WAS WOULD COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE AS I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE TOTAL WORD CRAFTING THAT WOULD BE. TO TIGHTEN THIS UP SO IT DOESN'T PROTECT SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING TO COVER UP MALFEASANCE. THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO AVOID PASSING ALONG INFORMATION SO IT MIGHT BE WE COULD TIGHTEN SO IF IF I MAY IF YOU LOOK AT AMENDMENT -- FOR UNDER. PAGE -- TO STRUT STRIKING OUTLINES -- TWENTY TWO TO THIRTY ONE UNDERSEA ONE IT SAYS THE RECORD HAS BEEN LOST OR DESTROYED DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES SO. THERE ARE IF IF IN FACT THIS IS DONE INTENTIONALLY -- AND IT HAS TO BE OUTSIDE OF THE MANAGING AGENTS CONTROL. SOLD BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY I THINK CLEARLY THAT'S YOUR INTENT AND PERHAPS TIGHTENING IT UP EVEN FURTHER -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE WHAT I THINK WE ALL SHARE -- THE NOTION THAT -- WE CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN THIS IN THE POLITICAL WORLD SUDDENLY DOCUMENTS DISAPPEAR ARE SHREDDED OVERNIGHT. THERE'S A SEVENTEEN MINUTE GAP IN THE TAPE -- THAT THE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT -- THAT CAN OCCUR BUT THOSE FOR INTENTIONAL SO. CERTAINLY WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT -- AND I AND I HOPE THAT TO AND I'M SURE YOU'RE COMMITTED TO DURING THAT ARTS. CENTER WERE CASKEY. I GUESS THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP THE IDEA OF HAVING THE RECORDS DIGITIZED BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S SAID CHALLENGE HERE OF WHO OWNS RECORDS IS THAT THE H. AWAY HE'S. PROPERTY THAT THEY OWN OR THIS PROPERTY MANAGER THAT'S BEEN HIRED FOR A FIVE YEAR -- IT WOULD IT WOULD BE THE UNDER THE OWNERSHIP OF THE H. AWAY RIGHT AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THIS OR THAT SUGGESTION IS IS THAT IT PITS DIGITIZE AND THEN IT'S ELECTRONICALLY TRANSMITTED TO THE H. AWAY. AND THE BOWL. THE AGENT AND THE H. AWAY. RETAIN IT THEN THERE'S LESS POTENTIAL FOR MALFEASANCE AND THE DESTRUCTION UP IN THE IN THE TO THE H. AWAY THAT HAS UPDATED RECORDS WHETHER THEY BE HARD COPY WHETHER THEY BE A COMPUTER. THE THE THE THE IDEA OF THIS SB FOUR THIRTY FOUR IS TO MAKE SURE THEY TURNED IT OVER AND OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER THAT'S IT WILL MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT. ON THE OTHER BUT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM SO IT CAN HAPPEN. MADAM CHAIR IF AFFECT FALL AYE I GUESS THE THE LANGUAGE I WAS NOT SUPPORT IN THE HOUSING -- COMMITTEE AND I'M LOOKING FOR AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY YOU KNOW THAT WE WE WE CREATE DUTIES ALL THE TIME FOR FOR FOLKS AND AND THERE'S A THERE'S A A PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY HAVE BUT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE ON THESE VITAL RECORDS. THIS SUGGESTION THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN. THEY THEY HAVE OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY MANAGERS AND I I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE COME A LONG WAYS TO CLOSE THE GAP BUT BUT I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR HERE IS THAT. IS THAT A DUTY TO PROTECT IN IT AND THAT THE THAT THEY ARE IN IGNORE WHICH MEANT THAT THEY ARE THE H. ALWAYS IT'S IT'S THERE BUT I MAYBE. WE CAN WE CAN. TAKE THOSE UP A LITTLE FURTHER AND AND MAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS. VERY GOOD WELL WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING YOU WILL BE AGREEABLE I I AGREE TO THERE HAS TO BE THAT THESE DO NOT BELONG. TO THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND THAT'S I THINK BEEN PART OF THE PROBLEM I MEAN YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL AND IT. SEEMS VERY COMMONSENSICAL BUT THERE'S JUST BEEN A MISSILE. A MISUNDERSTANDING BUT POLITELY ABOUT WHO OWNS THE DOCUMENTS AND CLEARLY IT DOES THE IT BELONGS TO THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION SO WITH THAT COMMITMENT I THINK THAT THAT -- HELPS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS SENATOR ALLEN THAT'S IMMENSELY HELPFUL I MEAN I WOULD JUST SAY TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE HERE WHO ARE RAISING CONCERNS YOU KNOW PLEASE. IN A MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE IN WRITING SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE. IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH COMMITTEES GONNA DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK WITH AUTHOR AND JUST GET THESE ISSUES -- CLEARED UP WE DON'T WANT -- YEAH ME TOO IS DESERVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT. TO YEAH THIS INFORMATION -- IT'S IT'S THEIR WITH THEIR PREPARED YOUR PROPRIETARY INFORATION NAY IT SOUNDS IT THAT'S WHAT THE OF THE CENTERS TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE AND SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE IN WILL. GET THE BILL CLEAN UP. APPRECIATE THAT AND AND THERE'S ANOTHER OPTION TWO IF THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION -- ONCE IT'S RECORDS KEPT IN A PARTICULAR FORMAT OR THEY CAN AND PROBABLY SHOULD -- SPECIFY THAT THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT THAT SHOULD BE CONTRACTUALLY PERHAPS WORK WE COULD YOU COULD ADD THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT IS -- SHALL BE PART OF ANY CONTRACT WITH THE BILL'S WORDING MATTER WAY IN A MANAGEMENT CAN DO THAT. VERY GOOD -- ALL RIGHT SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS. I'M SORRY CENTER CABALLERO. I AM I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE DID ON THIS I DID NOT SUPPORT THIS IN HOUSING BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE TOO MANY -- TOO MANY WAYS FOR THE PROPERTY MANAGER TO DESTROY RECORDS AND SAY GEE SORRY I CAN'T GIVE THEM TO YOU -- I THINK IT'S BEEN TIGHTENED UP AND I DO RECOMMEND THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WE'RE HERE WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR AND I THINK IF YOU READ THE THE AMENDMENTS OR THE WAY IT'S BEING CRAFTED NOW YOU'LL LIKE IT BETTER THAN IT WAS -- BEFORE AND I DO LIKE THE SUGGESTION OF A DUTY BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY-IMPORTANT I THINK THAT THE PROPERTY MANAGER HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE AS A DUTY AND HIS DUTY THAT PHRASE TO HIS CLIENTS AND THAT START SETTING UP ALL THESE RESPONSIBILITY SO. APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THEN APPRECIATE COMMITTEE -- NARROWING THE BILL AND WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE I AM PREPARED TO MAKE THE MOTION ON THIS. THANK YOU -- AND I THINK A YOU'VE HEARD THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION. BUT IT DOES NEED TO BE TIGHTENED AND SO WITH THAT COMMITMENT -- WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE THIS MANAGER THANK YOU -- I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTED AND I THINK WE'RE ON THE TWO YARD LINE. AND WILL BE ABLE TO PUT THIS TOGETHER AND COME BACK TO YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE TO TAKE IT FORWARD. VERY GOOD THANK YOU -- ALWAYS GOOD TO BE ON THE TWO YARD LINE GOT TO GET INTO THE END ZONE ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FLOOR. AND MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU WOULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS. FOR JUST AYE ALLEN ALLEN AYE AYE CABALLERO. CABALLERO AYE JONES MONNING. MONEY AYE STERN [inaudible] I'M BURKE. WHITE HOUSE SKI NOT VOTING HE DID. SEC THIS IS ON THE SECOND THE YARD LINE [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD OF A FIVE THE FIVE VOTES -- WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS I THINK I CENTER AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. ALL RIGHT. IT'S A PROGRESSION YES. ALRIGHT IF WE COULD JUST WAIT ONE MOMENT [inaudible] FOR ROOM. TO THE DOOR TO CLOSE HER HOW TO GETTING QUIETER SO GOOD SENATOR MORLOCK EUROPE NEXT AND YOU HAVE OF FILE ITEM. NINETEEN SB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR THE I DON'T SEE ANY WITNESSES DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH FOR WITNESSES SO -- GOOD AFTERNOON THE FLOOR IS YOURS HAPPY TO GET WITNESSES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. I WILL ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS REQUESTED BY THE COMMITTEE. AND THE BIG QUESTION. WITH MY BILL IS WHEN IS ELECTION AN ELECTION. IRAN FOR REELECTION FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY TREASURER -- THREE TIMES. NEVER HAD AN OPPONENT. I GET 98% OF THE VOTE I NGUYEN BUT WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR GOING THROUGH A SINGLE SLATE. ELECTION WAS IT EVEN NECESSARY THE RESULTS OF THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME THEY JUST SAID AT THE END OF FILING THAT -- YOU YOU YOU WON THE ELECTION WHICH IS DONE FOR A LOT OF MUNICIPALITY RACES -- BUT THE WAY TO HAVE AN ELECTION IS TO HAVE AT LEAST TWO CANDIDATES. FOR EACH OPEN POSITION THAT IS A DOUBLE SLATE. A SINGLE FLIGHT IS REDUNDANT AND COSTLY AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION SO. COLLEAGUES THE DAVIS STIRLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT NEEDS ANOTHER. BUT RATHER SIMPLE TWEAK. FOR THE BOARD ELECTIONS IF ONLY THE SAME NUMBER OF CANDIDATES OR LESS SUPPLY FOR THE AMOUNT OF OPEN SEATS. DURING THE FILING PERIOD THEN THE NOMINEES ARE CONSIDERED ELECTED BY ACCLAMATION -- I I LIVE IN TO HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS OF ONE HERE AND ONE AT HOME. IT IT'S TOUGH TO GET PEOPLE TO EVEN RUN FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BUT WHY SHOULD I BE RECEIVING A BALLOT IN THE MAIL. AFTER THE FILING PERIOD -- ON A SINGLE SLATE SB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR SAVES ON MAILING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IT'S ONE COMMUTER MY DISTRICT YOU'LL HEAR THE WITNESS YOU KNOW IT'S A CONSIDERABLE COST. SO THIS IS IDENTICAL TO SB ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT SENATOR ROBB FROM LAST YEAR. IT WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE -- LEGISLATURE -- WITH FULL SUPPORT BY BIPARTISAN BUT IT WAS A VETO BY THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE FELT THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IT -- WITH SOME MINOR CHANGES TO THE DAVIS STIRLING ACT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS BILL. SO FOR THOSE THAT HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH SEVEN FIFTY FOUR I WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT THEY GET A DOUBLE FLAYED GET MORE CANDIDATES THAN THE AVAILABLE SEATS. AND WITH THAT COLLEAGUES LET'S AND SB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR DOOR GOVERNOR AND GIVE CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS IMPACTED COMMUNITIES A BUDGET SAVING OPPORTUNITY. THEY WILL BE THANKFUL FOR AND I HAVE WITNESSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A TWO MINUTE TO VIEW IT. AND I'M CHAIR EMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME'S JEFF PARKER ON THE CEO AT LAGUNA WILL WOODS VILLAGE -- VERY LARGE HOMER SOCIAL ATION AND COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UNITS. APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE ON FXED INCOME AVERAGE AGE IS PROXIMALLY IN THE MID SEVENTIES. HAN WE HAVE THREE ELECTIONS EACH YEAR. AND THOSE ELECTIONS ARE COSTING US APPROXIMATELY -- SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THE THREE CUMULATIVE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE WE HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH CANDIDATES TO FILL THE SEATS OR JUST ENOUGH CANDIDATES TO FILL THE SEATS. AND YET WE'VE GONE AHEAD AND HAD THE ELECTION BECAUSE OF THE LAW RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S COST OUR RESIDENTS OUR COMMUNITY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHEN WITH THE ACCLAMATION THAT WE'RE REQUESTING? WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE THAT MONEY FOR OUR RESIDENTS AND PUT THAT BACK INTO THEIR POCKETBOOK AS OPPOSED. TO JUST SPENDING IT FOR SOMETHING THAT WASN'T NEEDED BECAUSE WE HAD THE NUMBER OF CANADA'S BUT NO EXTRAS. WE'VE DONE OUR EFFORTS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE AND GET THEM INVOLVED. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A VERY ACTIVE H. AWAY. AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMMITTEES AND WATER RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BEING ON THE BOARD WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS. IT BECAUSE IT'S AN ACTIVE COMMUNITY THEY CHOOSE THEIR ACTIVITIES IN WAY OF GOLF TENNIS AND OTHERS OTHER THAN BEING ON OUR BOARD. SO IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE BUT WE DO WANT TO GET PEOPLE RUN THAT WOULD BE THE BEST -- BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THE BEST DEMOCRATIC WAY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION TO SAVE OUR RESIDENTS MONEY AND WE'D APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT -- I JUST WANT TO REITERATE I WAS A CITY MANAGER PREVIOUSLY AND CITY OF CLAREMONT AND THE AND THE CITY OF TUSTIN AND IN COUPLE OF ELECTIONS WE HAD. SOME JUST ENOUGH CANDIDATES RUN ITS SAVE THOSE CITY SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BOTH OF THOSE ELECTIONS SO. IT MEANS A LOT TO OUR RESIDENTS TO SAY THAT KIND OF MONEY WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] WITNESS [inaudible] IN SUPPORT. NOW ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON MARJORIE MARIE AGAIN FROM THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA. HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW I WANT TO BELABOR THESE BASIC POINTS WHICH I HAVE MADE BEFORE TO THE COMMITTEE -- ALL BUT ALL FOUR FOCUS ON TWO ISSUES ONE IS THE COST ISSUE THE OTHER IS THAT. THERE IS AMPLE PRECEDENT IN OTHER. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES LIKE SCHOOL BOARDS EVEN CITY COUNCILS FOR THE USE OF ACCLAMATION. HOWEVER. SO WHAT THE SUPPORTERS HAVE OMITTED IS THAT. THE USE OF ACCLAMATION IS NOT. ABSOLUTE THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR THE ELECTORATE TO CHALLENGE THE USE OF ACCLAMATION AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH SB. SEVEN OF FIFTY FOUR THAT THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ELECTORATE THAT IS FOR HOMEOWNERS TO OBJECT TO THE USE OF ACCLAMATION. IT'S DONE BY FIAT BY THE BOARD WHICH SIMPLY DECLARES WE CAN'T FIND ENOUGH QUALIFIED PEOPLE AND THEREFORE WE HAVE GONE OUT TO FIND OUR OWN PEOPLE AND WE HAVE. A FILL THE EMPTY SEATS WITH THE CANDIDATES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED WHICH RAISES ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT I'S THE BOARD SETTING THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH CITY COUNCILS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL BOARDS. THOSE QUALIFICATIONS ARE SET BY THE ELECTIONS CODE. BUT IN THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION ENVIRONMENT. YOU HAVE NO SEPARATION OF POWERS TO HAVE A BOARD THAT SETS QUALIFICATIONS THAT RUNS ELECTIONS THE CHOOSES THE EQUIVALENT OF THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS. THAT COUNTS THE BALLOTS AND THEN DECLARES THAT THE CHOICE OF DIRECTORS. IT'S A DONE DEAL. SO IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD COMPARISON TO SAY. THAT THESE OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES USE ACCLAMATION AND THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE MIMICKED IN THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION ENVIRONMENT. AND FURTHER MORE IN SOMETHING LIKE A SCHOOL BOARD IF ENOUGH VOTERS AND THIS IS SET AGAIN IN THE ELECTIONS CODE. DEMAND THAT ELECTION BE HELD ITS HEALTH BUT THERE IS NO SUCH PROVISION IN SB SEVEN FIVE FOUR THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY TO OBJECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MON COST OF LONG CALIFORNIA WINES RETURN AMERICANS REPRESENTING OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. WE AE STRONGLY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YOUR CALL MARCUS FROM LOS ANGELES I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR.

HI THREE SALUKIS WEST SACRAMENTO YOLO COUNTY WAS REVIEW ON THE RIVER YOU. TO ENTERING FIFTY TWO U. CONDOS I WAS ON THE BOARD. I HAVE WHATEVER AND THE FACT IS DYSFUNCTIONAL. AND I'VE GOT ON THE MAN THANK YOU. ELLEN D'AGOSTINO I LIVE IN A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION ITSELF SACRAMENTO AND I'M OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL THANK YOU. GHOST BETTER BOARD PLASTER COUNTY I LIVE IN AN ASSOCIATION WE HAVEN'T HAD A NOMINATING COMMITTEE IN FOUR YEARS OR ELECTION IN FOUR YEARS. MY NAME IS FOR WITNESS WINE CO -- ROSEVILLE Là AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. MY NAME IS LINDA HOPS FROM SAN PEDRO CALIFORNIA WE GET THE SAME BOARD PRESIDENT FOR THIRTY YEARS I OPPOSED THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COURSE THIS BILL -- ADDRESSES WHEN THERE ARE NO OTHER PEOPLE RUNNING SO I THINK THAT THAT IS. A DIFFERENCE FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE ANY AMENDMENTS ALSO REQUIRE ELECTIONS SO IF YOU HAVEN'T IS SOME OF THESE OBJECTIONS WHILE. MANY OR OR WILL A TAKEN -- THERE ARE. THEY AREN'T ALL REFLECTIVE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN HERE -- SO -- LET'S SEE WE HAVE -- AMENDMENTS TO PROTECT AGAINST THE ABUSE OF DISQUALIFICATION SO I THINK THIS WAS CENTER WHITE HOUSE KEYS CONCERNED. ABOUT A ABUSING THE DISQUALIFICATION PROCESS AS A METHOD OF INSULATING IN COMMENTS -- IN THEIR BOARDS AGAINST. AND THOSE HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN IN THIS BILL -- AND THE GOAL IS TO TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHERE THERE ARE NOT PEOPLE RUNNING SO THAT WHEN THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN ELECTION BUT AS CENTER Y. CASKEY POINTED OUT. THREE ELECTIONS IN ONE YEAR I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S A HA HA HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN. WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT MUTUALS -- WHICH THEY HAD THREE BOARDS SEPARATE BOARDS SO THEY HAVE FOR EACH MUTUAL THEY HELPED OUT ELECTION INDEPENDENTLY. AND AND LET ME JUST FINISH UP THEN I'LL GO AHEAD AND OPEN AT THE OTHER MAN MEANT -- REQUIRES A CHOICE TO CONDUCT AN ELECTION AT THE END OF EACH DIRECTORS EXPIRING TERM BUT IN NO EVENT LESS THAN ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS SO. THE CONCERN ABOUT SORT OF THE HEAVY HANDEDNESS. WHICH IS A PROBLEM. IS AVOIDED HERE AT WORST. HOPEFULLY ABORTED HERE AND AGAIN THE GOAL HERE IS WHERE AND PEOPLE DO NOT WISH TO STEP UP. THAT THERE WILL BE THOSE OF MEN THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCLAMATION BUT CERTAINLY OPEN TO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS OF ANY ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS SENATOR CAFIERO. VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I GUESS -- YOU KNOW AS I'VE BEEN READING ALL OF THESE -- H. AWAY BILLS COMING THROUGH I WONDER. SEEMS TO BE THE H. AWAY YEAR. SENATOR AYE KASKI WAS. COMMENTING -- I WONDER WHETHER THIS CAN BE DONE IN THE IN THE IN THE BY LAWS. OF THE H. AWAY. AND IT'S IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING TO MAKE THE CHANGE SO THE BY. SO IT IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS ONCE WE ALLOW IT AS A PERMISSIBLE. OPTION THAT THEN THEY CAN BE ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN THE BY LAWS MY UNDERSTANDING OKAY THAT THAT THAT CLARIFIES IT FOR ME BECAUSE I IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO RUN AGAINST OTHER. OTHER INDIVIDUALS YOU DON'T WANT TO YOU DON'T WANT TO SET IT UP SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE NOTICE IN YOUR KIND OF JUST RUNNING THE SHOW ALL BY YOURSELF RIGHT. YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE THE THE THE THE MEMBERS OF THE H. AWAY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT AND AND THAT CLARIFICATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR ALLEN FULL BY CENTER MONNING JUST TO PROTECT INTEGRITY THOSE ELECTIONS CAN CAN YOU SORT OF WALK THROUGH WHAT'S REQUIRED IN TERMS A NOTICE. SO THAT FOLKS WILL BE GIVEN SOME. DEGREE OF WARNING THAT YEAH THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO RUN FOR THE BOARD AND ENGAGE. OTHERS ALREADY IN LAW A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE A NOTICE PERIOD. AND SO IT'S LIKE A FILING PERIOD YOU'RE YOU'RE TOLD BY THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION IF YOU WANT TO SERVE ON THE BOARD PLEASE APPLY BY THIS PARTICULAR DATE WHO HAS THAT DISSEMINATED TO THE RESIDENTS BUT DEPENDS IT'S USUALLY A MANAGEMENT COMPANY. RETIRED BY THE BY THE THE BOARD AND AND THEY HANDLE ALL THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE BOARD. THE THE DO THEY HAVE TO MAIL SOMETHING TO ALL THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS IS THAT. THAT'S HOW I HOW I GET AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I GET MINE WELL WE ALSO HAVE -- THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS. WHICH IS HIRED AS PART OF THE PROCESS -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE WITH WITH THE THE VILLAGE -- BECAUSE OF THE SIZE WE'VE -- CONTRACT OUT THE ELECTION PROCESS AS FAR AS HANDLING ALL THE BALLOTS AND NOTICING REQUIREMENTS. AND SO THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO THAT NOTICING OF THIRTY DAYS PRIOR. TO OKAY SO THAT THE DETAILS GET CLARIFICATION LIKE THE LAW SAYS THAT EVERY. MEMBER OF ANY JOE A HAS TO BE RECEIVING MAILS NOTICE. THIRTY DAYS BEFORE YOUR FILING DEADLINE IS THAT IS THAT THE LAW. THAT'S THE WAY THAT'S THE FORM OF NOTICES YOU HAVE TO BE POSTING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE BUILDING OR YOU WOULD DO WE WOULD DO THAT ALSO -- BUT THIS IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IRON WILL I MEAN I MAYBE BEST PRACTICE THIRTY DAY. JUST THE OKAY. NO POSTING IS NECESSARY. UNDER LAW. I BELIEVE SO. JUST WANTED TO JUMP AND I APOLOGIZE SENATOR -- EXISTING LAW HAS A FORTY FIVE DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENTS GENERAL NOTICE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE'S AN ELECTION COMING UP. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN ADDITION TO ABOUT IS IF A BOARD -- INTENDS OR THAT ACCLAMATION MAYBE AN OPPORTUNITY -- THIRTY DAYS BEFORE NOMINATIONS ARE TO CLOSE THEIR REQUIRED TO SEND INDIVIDUAL NOTICE TO EACH OF THEIR MEMBERS SO THAT INDIVIDUAL NOTICES EITHER THROUGH EMAIL. THROUGH MAIL -- THEY WOULD ALSO MORE THAN LIKELY POSTED ON THEIR THEIR WEBSITE AND IN COMMON AREAS BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE CHEN OF INDIVIDUAL NOTICE. OF BECAUSE OF THE OPPONENTS CONCERNS OVER NOTICE REQUIREMENTS. IT REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL NOTICE THERE'S NO INDIVIDUAL NOTICE. I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT THE WHEN THERE'S AN ELECTION THERE HAS TO BE INDIVIDUAL NOTICE. AS WELL. THERE IT WOULD IT END UNDER THIS BILL YOU HAVE TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL NOTICE THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF NOMINATIONS THERE'S IF THERE'S NO. ONE ELSE RUNNING BEYOND THE COMPASS. IF THE BOARDED UP HOUSE THE INCLINATION THAT THEY MIGHT CHOOSE TO USE ACCLAMATION IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE THAT NOTICE YOU HAVEN'T MET THE LETTER OF THE LAW AND YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE THE ACCLAMATION. OF THE PROCESS. OKAY I I I I SOUNDS LIKE JUST A LITTLE MURKY ABOUT WHAT. WITH THE LIES IN TERMS OF THE NOTICE REQUIRED FREE ACCLIMATION. THE THE THE ONLY NOTICE IT'S REQUIRED IN EXISTING LAW IS THE FORTY FIVE DAY NOTICE THAT AN ELECTION WILL BE COMING UP. AND I NOTICE IT TAKES WHAT FORM EXACTLY. A AND I BELIEVE THAT IS GENERAL NOTICE SO THAT COULD BE POSTED ON THE WEBSITE IT COULD BE POSTED IN A COMMON AREA -- MY RECOLLECTION AND I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT -- IT IS GENERAL NOTICE NOT INDIVIDUAL NOTICE JUST THAT THERE'S AN ELECTION COMING UP. SO IS IT SECTION GFI MAY IT'S JUST WHEN AS OF THE CLOSE OF NOMINATIONS FOR DIRECTOR ON THE BOARD. THE NUMBER OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES IS NOT MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES TO BE ELECTED. AS DETERMINED BY THE INSPECTOR OR INSPECTORS OF THE ELECTION THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES SHALL BE CONSIDERED ELECTED BY ACCLAMATION. IF THE ASSOCIATION PROVIDED INDIVIDUAL NOTICE. ARE ALL OF THE ELECTION AND THE PROCEDURE FOR NOMINATING CANDIDATES AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THE CLOSE OF NOMINATIONS SO IT DOESN'T BECOME EFFECTIVE THE REGIONAL ACCLAMATION. IF THEY HAVEN'T COMPLIED WITH THIS NOTICE REQUIREMENT. THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THE CLOSE OF NOMINATIONS. THE CENTER MONNING IT'S ON PAGE IF YOU'D LIKE TO LOOK AT IT'S PAGE -- THREE I SECTION GEE IT'S A NEW IT'S AN AMENDMENT INCLUDED IN THE BILL. SO IN THAT ALSO FEATURED PAGE SEVEN MM [inaudible] FOR THE THE ASSOCIATION. PROVIDES INDIVIDUAL NOTICE OF THE ELECTION IN THE PROCEDURE FOR NOMINATING CANDIDATES AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THE CLOSE OF NOMINATIONS. SO EVERY MEMBER OF THE H. SHOW A WILL RECEIVE NOTICE OF THE PENDING ELECTION. THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF THE NOMINATION PERIOD. SO IF YOU'RE THE MEMBER AND YOU WANT TO RUN YOU CAN NOMINATE YOURSELF -- BUT I DO THINK THERE WAS A MAYBE A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING. IF THIS PASSES IT'S NOT OPTIONAL FOR THE H. SHOW A IT WOULD BECOME THE LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT WOULD. REQUIRE A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION TO PROVIDE THIS NOTICE. THIRTY DAYS PRIOR -- AND TO ALLOW QUALIFIED CANDIDATES WITH ONLY A NUMERATOR EXEMPTIONS SO THAT THE EXISTING BOARD COULDN'T DISQUALIFY SOMEBODY [inaudible] WHIMSICALLY. ONLY BASED ON SPECIFIC ACCEPTABLE CRITERIA. ON SO I THINK WITH THE AMENDMENTS. IT PROVIDES PROTECTIONS FOR A AWAY. RESIDENTS AND MEMBERS DUES PAYERS -- TO INTERVENE AND ELECTION THEY CAN'T. THIS PROVISION OF ACCLAMATION ONLY FOLLOWS. THERE'S NOT TOO CANDIDATES FOR SINGLE POSITION. SO JUST PLAYING THIS OUT IF I COULD. IF YOU HAVE THREE OFFICER POSITIONS PRESIDENT. VICE PRESIDENT SECRETARY. IN THREE PEOPLE FILE FOR PRESIDENT. TWO PEOPLE FILE FOR PRESIDENT NOBODY FOR VICE FOR ONE FOR VICE PRESIDENT ONE FOR SECRETARY. YOU CAN ELECT THE VICE PRESIDENT SECRETARY BY ACCLAMATION YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD AN ELECTION. FOR THE CONTESTED PRESIDENT POSITION IS THAT CORRECT. DID YOU FOLLOW ME. HE SAID NO YOU CAN'T EXERCISE THE ACCLAMATION PROVISIONS IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE CANNON RIGHT SO MY MY FIRST RESPONSE CENTER MINING IS THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION AND THEN I MADE IT MORE CONFUSING. NO NO. GREATER PRO OKAY -- THE SECOND IS -- I EAT A USUALLY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU VOTE FOR A SLATE OF CANDIDATES I DON'T THINK YOU VOTE BY OFFICER RIGHT TO BE CORRECTED BY BY MISTER PARKER BUT BUT IF THERE ARE. THREE SLOTS OPEN. AND EIGHT PEOPLE RUN YOU HAVE AN ELECTION IT RECORDS IF THERE ARE THREE SLOTS OPEN AND TWO OR ONE OR THREE RUN. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE VOTING FOR THEM FOR THEIR PARTICULAR OFFICE THAT IS DONE BY THE BOARD ITSELF. THANK YOU HAVE A FOLLOW THAT CLARIFICATION. IS WELL -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION OFFERED BY THESE AMENDMENTS. WOULD ENCOURAGE THOSE. MEMBERS HERE WITH CONCERNS TO READ THOSE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. WE HAVE TRIED TO TIGHTEN THIS UP SO THAT THESE HORROR STORIES THAT. MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED ARE NOT GOING TO TRANSLATE INTO. THIS KIND OF RUNNING ROUGHSHOD WITH BLUE -- ALEXIAN IS BY ACCLAMATION AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS THIS THIS A BILL THAT DIE BILLY SENATOR ROTH WORKED ON LAST YEAR WE TOOK A NUMBER THESE AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE. IT WAS AMENDED EVEN FURTHER -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS DEAD CENTER MORE LIKE IT'S TAKEN THOSE AMENDMENTS. AND THEN SOME SO THAT -- WE THINK WE'VE TIGHTENED THE SHOP -- EFFECTIVELY. ABSOLUTELY WELL THAT'S THE HOPE. OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SEEING NON SENATE-ROOM. DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. ALL RIGHT TO WE HAVE A MOTION. MOVED BY SENATOR BORCHERS AS AMENDED SENATOR MORE LOCKED THE FLOOR IS YOURS TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR AMENDMENTS IN YOUR CLARIFICATIONS -- I I I KNOW THEIR HORROR STORIES IN DEALING WITH A MANIPULATED BOARD. THAT ORDINANCE GROUP OF HIS BOARD GETS IS A WHOLE FRUSTRATING THAT TESTED OR WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH BUT THEY'RE NOT THE NORMAL WE'VE GOT OVER FIFTY THOUAND HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS -- THAT COULD USE A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF -- SO YOU KNOW OPPOSING A VOTE BY ACCLAMATION DOESN'T SOLVE THEIR ISSUES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

AWAY NO EXCUSE ME -- WITH THESE AMENDMENTS AS THIS ONE YEAH NOT THIS ONE SB THREE OH THREE CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW WHICH GENERALLY ARE PROJECTS TO CONSERVE. CONSERVATIVES GOVERNMENT BENEFITS FROM BEING USED TO PAY CONSERVATORS FEES ADDITIONALLY THE BILL STRENGTHENS THE STATUE CONCERNING THE SALE OF THE CONSERVATIVES RESIDENTS BY REQUIRING A SHOWING OF CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE TO THE COURT. OF THE NEED AND BENEFIT FOR THE SALE THE IMPORTANCE OF A HOME CANNOT BE OVERSTATED WHAT THE SALE MAY BE NECESSARY IN CERTAIN CASES WE MUST ENSURE THAT IS ACTUALLY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CONSERVATIVE.

SUPERIOR COURT CONSERVATIVE MICHELLE TURN IN AND HER ATTORNEY RUBIN SENDING WHO IS NOW COMMISSIONER AND THE SAME PROBATE COURT. MY MOM'S TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP IS A MEMBER. OF THE P. FACT THIS P. FAC MEMBER WAS APPOINTED TO BECOME THE SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE OF MY FAMILY'S LIVING TRUST AND COLLECTED SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS AFTER. MY MOTHER WAS RELEASED FROM THE TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP OF THE PERSON. THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE AWARDED APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEES FOR NINETY DAYS TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP WITHOUT INVENTORY AND FAILURE TO PROVIDE OUR FAMILY AND UPDATED ITEMIZED ACCOUNTING. OF THE CORRECT FEES -- FEES CLAIM TO BE -- FLUCTUATED FROM TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ALMOST SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AFTER THE JUDGE DROPPED THE TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP CASE IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN UPON THE TERMINATION OF THE TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP WHAT MY MOM'S SS BENEFITS WERE BEING FEES. WITH THE COURT'S APPROVAL. IN APPARENT VIOLATION OF FEDERAL REGULATION. FAMILY WAS FORCED TO PROVIDE FOR FOOD PUTTING THE BURDEN ON THE REST OF THE FAMILY. AFTER FASTER TRUSTEE THE CONSERVATOR SERVED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED ACTION ON MY PARENTS AND THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE FAMILIES TRUSTS THREATENING TO SELL MY PARENTS PROPERTY WORTH EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS WAS AFTER THE CONSERVATIVE IN HER ATTORNEYS TOOK MOST OF THEIR FEES AND THE BALANCE LEFT WAS JUST SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB THREE OH THREE TO PROTECT OUR ELDERLY INDEPENDENT ADULTS FROM ABUSE OF THEIR ASSETS THANK YOU. VERY MUCH OF THE NEXT WITNESS AND I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF STORIES WHERE WE'VE SO I KNOW OF SOME MYSELF AND THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT AREA WHERE THERE IT.

GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS GERRY DOES MEN AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. A TREE GROUP STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR CO SPONSORED THE LEGISLATION THAT ESTABLISHED PROFESSIONAL PRETTY SURE WE ACT A LICENSURE AN EXAMINATION AND EDUCATION SCHEME WE HAVE FOR HER AND FIFTY FIVE MEMBERS ARE LICENSED. AND I'LL OFFER OF FIRST OFF THAT WE SEE THE AMENDMENTS -- WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO DIGEST A MEMBER A GIVER FORMAL -- REMOVAL OF OPPOSITION WHERE TEIR CONCERNS REMAIN BUT I CAN HIGHLIGHT WHAT I THINK WE SEE ADDRESSED. AND TO SAY OF TO START WITH AS P. FACT THAT THE PROTECTION OF THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CONSERVATIVE -- BUT MOST AND THAT IS A GUIDANCE SO IT SHOULD PROVIDE TO EVERYBODY THAT'S INVOLVED -- WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS IN IT IN PREPARATION FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHORS TAKING WOULD TREAT MUCH APPRECIATE AND THAT. OF COMMITTEES DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THERE'S AN ATTEMPT. TO ACKNOWLEDGE OF THE ISSUES HAT ARE PROP IN OUR OPPOSITION FIRST IS THE RULES OF THE COURT AND THE LAWS THAT APPLY IN THESE SITUATIONS. THE SECOND IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE AREN'T UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BEING THAT A PERSON WHO IS A CONSERVATIVE HE DOESN'T GET THE CARE THEY NEED BECAUSE HAS INTRODUCED THE LEGISLATION WOULD PROHIBIT ANY GOVERNMENT SOURCE OF FUNDS. TO PAY FOR A CONSERVATIVE AND IF I WERE TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE SEE IN THAT WILL INFORM US AS WE LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS. WHICH WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATE IT'S A BOOK. STATUTES AND COURT DECISIONS AND RULES OF COURT THAT ARE IN THE A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND JUST. TO MENTION THE THREE IN A CONCLUDE MY TWO MINUTES ONE IS THE RULES THAT APPLY TO THE TO THE ROLE O THE CONSERVATIVE OF THE CONSERVATORY IN CONSERVATORSHIP SAND THAT IS TO EXERCISE DILIGENCE. AND CARE IN THESE IN THESE SITUATIONS AS PROBATE CODE. TWENTY FOUR OH ONE ANOTHER IS THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COURTS AND AS MENTIONED ON PAGE THREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF ANALYSIS IT'S TO DILIGENTLY SCRUTINIZE THE ACTIONS OF THE CONSERVATOR THE GUARD. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT AND THE THIRD IS THE ISSUE OF COMPENSATION AN ANALYSIS STATES THAT ON PAGE THREE AGAIN THAT IT'S TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT ON REASON THAT THEY ARE JUSTIFIABLE AND REASONABLE. AND THAT THERE IS A GOOD BOOK FAITH BELIEF IN THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THEM AND THEN FINALLY IN THE RULES OF COURT HAVING TO DO WITH THE CRITERIA TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE COMPENSATION IS JUST. WELL THERE IS A LIST TO THE COME TO MY MIND TO TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION HERE IS THAT THE COMPENSATION IS TO THE BENEFIT OF THE CONSERVATIVE AGAIN THE OF MOST INTEREST THAT WE OUT. AND ALSO THAT THEY ARE NECESSARY SO WITH THAT SEEN THE AMENDMENTS WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE EFFORT TO BLEND IN THE ROLE OF THE COURTS WHICH WE THINK IS UP MOST INAPPROPRIATE. AND THEN ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A A REASONABLE BASIS FOR THE FOR THE LIMITATIONS AND ALSO NOTE THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE FIRST SET OF AMENDMENTS. ADDRESSING THE A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE FOR WHETHER THE RESIDENTS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR THE CONSERVATIVE WE KNOW THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME WORK OF MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS OF WHAT IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE. WHAT IS THE COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO ADDRESS THE PRESUMPTIONS AND ALSO TO TO TO TO FIND THAT AND TO ADDRESS WHAT IF THERE IS THE CONSENT OF THE CONSERVATIVE? AND THOSE ARE ALSO MENTION IN THE ANALYSIS SO WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE IN THE AUTHOR IN THE PROPONENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEIR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE BRINGING OF BACK TO THE DíAS I WANT TO JUMP IN HERE I HAVE SEEN. A NUMBER OF CASES IN A CONSERVATIVE THESE ARE FREQUENTLY PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER PHYSICALLY OR COGNITIVELY DISABLED THE NOTION THAT A CONSERVATIVE HE MIGHT SAY YES SELL MY HOUSE -- MAY NOT VERY WELL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO -- THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW CENTERS SADLY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE SUFFER WITH DEMENTIA OR OR OTHER FORMS. OF COGNITIVE -- CHALLENGES SO -- OF I I THINK THAT IT'S I APPRECIATE THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSERVED. ARE CONSERVED USUALLY FOR VERY GOOD REASON AND THAT THEY ARE. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY NEED THAT ASSISTANCE AND THAT WE DO HAVE WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC GUARDIANS ARE CONSERVATIVES. PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO AND CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE. AND THEN WE HAVE THE COURTS -- AND FREQUENTLY THERE THE JUDGES ARE KIND OF BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE HERE WOULD WITHOUT ENOUGH TIME TO REALLY STUDY EACH CASE BUT AFTER AWHILE. YOU SAIL HERE COMES ANOTHER CONSERVATORSHIP CASE WITHOUT REALLY -- HAVING. THE ABILITY TO X. TO APPRECIATE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL CONSERVATIVELY OR THE THE EXPERTS OF THE CONSERVATOR SOMETIMES OUR FAMILY MEMBERS SOMETIMES THERE'S A LACK OF FUNDING -- AND AND THERE ARE CERTAIN NEEDS THAT ARE -- REQUIRED BUT CERTAINLY IN TODAY'S WORLD AS WE BECOME AN AGING POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE HALL TO HOUSE OUR SENIOR POPULATION THE MORE WE CAN HOUSE PEOPLE AT HOME -- THE BETTER FOR THEM AND THE BETTER FOR OUR OF OUR SOCIETY WE JUST DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR THESE FOLKS AND WE DON'T WANT THEM OUT IN THE STREET WHICH IS WHERE A LOT OF SENIORS ARE ENDING UP THESE DAYS SO. APPRECIATE THE PROTECTIONS I THINK A CLARA CONVINCING STANDARD IT'S A HIGH ONE BUT I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE THINGS I'VE JUST MENTIONED ALSO THE USE OF GOVERNMENT FUNDS -- YOU KNOW FOR A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THIS IS IT. THE CHOICE BETWEEN DOG FOOD OR CAT FOOD -- MEDICINES AND ALL AND AND AND YET THERE'S THAT SWEET SPOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COURT NEXT IS THE VOICE OF THESE. INDIVIDUAL SO I DO APPRECIATE THE THIS PROCESS IT IS AN IMPERFECT TWENTY BEST -- THE STORIES ARE LEGEND OUT THERE AND I KNOW MANY OF THEM MYSELF -- BUT I THINK THIS REALLY DOES GO A LONG WAY AND SO I I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THE MEASURE AND WOULD OPEN UP IF THERE ARE ANY COMMENTS. MOTION BY CENTER MONNING ANY QUESTIONS NINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YOUR CHEN I VOTE VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND WITH THAT. WE HAVE A MOTION DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FLOOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THREE ON PAGES FIVE TO SEVEN COMMON FOR THAT YOU WILL BE ACCEPTING IS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS CORRECT EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB. THREE SEVENTY ONE WHICH ADDRESSES THE ALARMING NUMBER OF SCHOOL CHILDREN STRUCK BY VEHICLES WHILE GOING TO AND FROM THEIR SCHOOL BUS. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS. AND WILL BE ACCEPTING THEM AS I AS WITH AS THEY ARE PROPOSED AND I MIGHT MENTION THERE BEING PASSED AROUND THIS IS ALLEGE COUNCIL VERSION SO YOU CAN SEE IN PRINT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE DEAD A WRITTEN UP IN THE ANALYSIS THAT ARE NOW IN THAT FORMAT THAT WE CAN. LOOK AT SOME THANK YOU THANK YOU. DURING EVER SCHOOL DAY IN CALIFORNIA SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN RIDE A SCHOOL BUS TO AND FROM THEIR SCHOOL. ACCORDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PEOPLE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES THERE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC NOR THE STATE SCHOOL BUS STOP LAW. AS A SPEED BY SCHOOL BUSES AS CHILDREN APPROACH -- EXIT THIS BILL WOULD AMEND THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE TO PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE OPTION TO INCORPORATE SCHOOL BUS. STOP LAW VIDEO TECHNOLOGY THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT STOP VIOLATIONS. SB THREE SEVENTY ONE CONTAINS PRIVACY JUDICIAL PROCESS SIGNAGE REQUIREMENTS AND PUBLIC EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS BEFORE VIDEO TECHNOLOGY CAN BE UTILIZED THE BILL ALSO PROTECTS SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS. AS WELL AS SCHOOL EMPLOYEES FOR MANY INCREASED LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VIDEO TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYED ON THE BUS WHILE THEY'RE DRIVING. THESE PRACTICES ARE TAKEN FROM SIXTEEN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED VIDEO TECHNOLOGY. CALIFORNIA HAS TRAFFIC SAFETY LAWS IN PLACE FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN THE LAW REQUIRES DRIVERS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FLASHING RED LIGHTS. AND THE STOP ARM ON SCHOOL BUSES DRIVERS BY LAW ARE REQUIRED TO STOP BEHIND A SCHOOL BUS WHEN DRIVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. AND BEFORE A SCHOOL BUS WHEN DRIVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THE FACT THAT CHILDREN TODAY CONTINUE TO BE STRUCK BY DRIVERS WHO DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAW INDICATES THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS BILL PROVIDES SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH ANOTHER TOOL TO ENSURE CHILDREN ARE SAFE BOTH IN SCHOOL AND IN AND ITS VICINITY IF THEY WISH TO USE IT. SB THREE SEVENTY ONE PUT CHILDREN SAFETY FIRST AND IT'S IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT IT'S AN OPTION IT'S A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. MY NAME IS THE BARREL AND I'M THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR STATEWIDE FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH AND ALSO THE CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA UNINTENTIONAL INJURY PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN PROJECT. TRY TO GET A LONGER NAME BUT WE COULDN'T -- THAT IS A PROJECT AS TRYING TO ELIMINATE UNINTENTIONAL INJURY FROM BEING THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AND HOSPITALIZATION POOL DROWNING SUFFOCATION TRAFFIC NON TRAFFIC ISSUES. THIS BILL IS PART OF THE TRAFFIC SUB COMMITTEES -- TOP TEN RECOMMENDATIONS TRYING TO ADDRESS PEDESTRIAN ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING OUR CHILDREN AND AS THE AUTHOR -- THE SENATOR LAYS OUT. WE STOP LAW HAS BEEN IN CALIFORNIA LAW FOR OVER TWENTY SOME YEARS IT'S AN OLD LAW. IT MOST PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THIS MOST PEOPLE ARE ARE SUPPOSED TO STOP WE HAVE THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION CARS THAT VIOLATE THEIR OWN JUST CREEP BY ABOUT SAY JUST DRIVE FULL SPEED RIGHT BY A BUS EVEN THOUGH THE FLASHING LIGHTS AND STOP ARM. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN HIT SINCE. TWO THOUSAND AND SIX ACCORDING TO OUR C. H. P. COLLISION DATA -- THOSE ARE FATAL AND SEVERE INJURIES OR THEY WOULDN'T SHOW UP IN THAT BACK DATA BASE -- WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN TRYING TO GO TO AND FROM THE SCHOOL BUSES THAT IS THE SENATOR SAYS SO IT'S NOT JUST THE ONES THAT ARE GETTING HIT IT'S THE ONES THAT ARE NEAR MISSES AND WHEN YOU WATCH THE FILMS FROM OTHER STATES SIXTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE HAD. TO GO TO THIS CAMERA SYSTEM. JUST TO TRY TO FIND SOME WAY OF GETTING PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE STOP LAW. AND SO IT HAS WORKED IN MARYLAND THEY HAD A 50% DROP IN THE VIOLATIONS IN GEORGIA THEY HAD A BUT IT DOES HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON GIVING PEOPLE A BIG NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP INSIDE THE BILL THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE STAFF. THEIR WORK WITH THIS HARD ON PRIVACY RIGHTS PROCESS ISSUES JUDICIAL ISSUES -- AND IT AND NOW THERE'S A LONG EDUCATIONAL PERIOD THE THERE'SA LONGER WARNING PERIOD WERE YOU ONLY CAN GET A WARNING EVEN IF YOU'RE CAUGHT BY ONE OF THESE CAMERAS IF A SCHOOL DIFFERENT. DISTRICT DOES CHOOSE TO TO THANK DAVIS ON SO WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOES YOUR MEMORY IT REALLY SOLVE A LOT OF THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOT THAT STOPWATCH READY SENATE. ALL MADAM CHAIR MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M CATHY RANK AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH I'LL BE VERY BRIEF I JUST WANT. TO EMPHASIZE THOSE NUMBERS AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK WE SAID I'M KIND OF FAST BUT NATIONALLY THE HIGHWAY INSTITUTE INFORMS US THAT THERE ARE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN. THAT ARE TREATED IN EMERGENCY ROOMS EVERY YEAR FOR INCIDENTS RELATED TO GETTING ON OR GETTING OFF A BUS. AND WHILE SEVEN CHILDREN ARE KILLED ANNUALLY FROM BUS CRASHES NINETEEN ARE KILLED ANNUALLY BY BEING HIT BY A CAR TRYING TO PASS THE SCHOOL BUS TOO QUICKLY. THE REALLY SAD PART ABOUT THIS IS THAT THESE KIDS THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE CHILDREN THAT STRUCK BY A CAR IS FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS OLD. THEY'RE A LITTLE. I SEE TEN YEAR OLDS FORGET TO LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE THEY GO OUT INTO THE STREET SO IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS. TO KEEP THESE VERY VERY YOUNG CHILDREN SAFE AND SENATORS MEASURE WILL GO A LONG WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT SITUATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON [inaudible] THEN. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON OUR CONCERNS AND AND FOR THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WHICH WHICH TO GO SOME WAY STE IN RESOLVING OUR CONSENT CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE SOME CONCERNS I'M EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT THAT SHE'S TAKEN IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE PRIVACY ISSUES -- IT IS SPECIFICALLY SB THREE SEVENTY ONE DOES NOT INCLUDE PARTS SPECIFIC PROTECTIONS AGAINST THE USE OF AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READER TECHNOLOGY OR VIDEO ANALYTICS WHICH CAN BE USED TO COMPILE DATABASES OF INFORMATION CAPTURED. BY SCHOOL BUS CAMERA THAT CAN THEN BE USED TO TRACK THE LOCATIONS OF VEHICLES AND THE PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE VEHICLES -- WE WE HAVE ASKED THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED SPECIFICALLY TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES WITH THE SCHOOL BUS VIDEO RECORDING SYSTEMS -- WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY USE THE INFORMATION FROM THE SCHOOL BUS CAM RECORDINGS FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE SCHOOL BUS PASSING VIOLATIONS -- WE ASK THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO CLARIFY THAT THIS IS THE ONLY USE PERMITTED -- FINALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED THIRTY DAYPERIOD OF ATTENTION FOR THE RECORDINGS REMAINS TO HIGH IF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ONLY USING THE RECORDINGS TO REVIEW THEM WHEN INFORMED BY A DRIVER OF A POSSIBLE VIOLATION. THERE'S NO NEED TO KEEP THEM FOR A FULL MONTH WE WOULD SUGGEST A SEVEN DAY RETENTION PERIOD -- IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT FORTUNATELY THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW INCIDENTS OF OF INJURIES TO SCHOOL CHILDREN FROM FROM -- VEHICLES -- ILLEGALLY PASSING THE SCHOOL BUSES WELL OF COURSE WE SHARE THE CONCERN THAT TO PROTECT THEIR SAFETY -- WE WE WHAT -- AT EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO BALANCE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED ANY TIME THERE IS A GOVERNMENT OPERATED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS CAMERA THAT THAT WILL BE USED BY SCHOOL DISTRICT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE BRINGING IT BACK TO THE DíAS -- CENTER BORCHERS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES THAT WAS IT NINETY DAYS AND THAT WAS DROPPED. TO THIRTY YEAH IN T. THAT STILL. NOT SATISFACTORY BUT IT WELL SUBMIT ANY TIME INFORMATION LIKE THIS ARE RECORDINGS OF LISTS ARE KEPT THE LONGER THEY'RE KEPT THAT THE MORE OPPORTUNITY THERE IS FOR THERE TO BE SOME MISUSE OF THEM AND WHERE. THEY ARE ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR THE SPECIFIC -- PURPOSE AND THIS IS ONLY FOR THE RECORDS THAT DON'T SHOW A VIOLATION RIGHT TO WHERE THEY SHOW A VIOLATION THEY CAN BE KEPT. ON THROUGH THE PERIOD NEEDED TO ENFORCE AGAINST THAT VIOLATION BUT WHERE THEY DON'T SHOW A VIOLATION THERE'S INSTANT SIMPLY NO REASON FOR THEM TO BE KEPT FOR A FULL MONTH IT THERE IS. A SHORTER TIME PERIOD IS PLENTY OF TIME FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND SAY. YEAH THERE'S NO VIOLATION IN THIS PART WE NO LONGER NEED TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION YOUR OTHER RECOMMENDATION WAS -- TO DISALLOW. ANY USE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT DOES NOT PERTAIN TO VEHICLES AND CHILD SAFETY. ARE THE DOES NOT PERTAIN TO THE SPECIFIC PASSING VIOLATIONS IN IN QUESTION [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING. YEAH I GUESS PICKING UP ON THAT LAST POINT FOR THE AUTHOR -- DO YOU HAVE ANY. PROBLEM WITH PROHIBITING. USE OTHER THAN ENFORCEMENT OF TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS FROM THE INFORMATION GATHERED. SALOMEA SAY THAT -- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN NEGOTIATING AND AT SOME POINT YOU GOT TO GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU SAY THIS IS. THIS IS IT AND WE'VE TAKEN ALL YOUR SUGGESTIONS SO WE WE TOOK THE SUGGESTION TO LIMIT THE TIME. THAT THE VIDEO COULD BE -- IN SOMEONE'S HANDS FROM NINETY DAYS TO THIRTY DAYS AND WE ALSO WORKED REALLY HARD. TO GET IT AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MAKING THE DECISION WHETHER THERE WAS A VIOLATION -- AND SO IT GETS TRANSFERRED FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE EVALUATION IN ISSUE A TICKET IF IF IF IT'S APPROPRIATE -- AND SO WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM ENOUGH TIME TO ACTUALLY GET TO IT AND THEN THERE IS AN AMENDMENT THAT REQUIRES THAT THE BUS DRIVER LET THEM KNOW THAT SOMEBODY PASSED. SO THAT THERE'S THERE'S A AND NOTICE THAT THEY NEED TO LOOK AT AT THE AT THE TAPE IN ORDER TO FIND THAT VIOLATION AND ISSUE THAT THE WARNING OR THE TICKET WHERE WHICHEVER -- IS IS -- IS APPROPRIATE AND THEN THE VIDEO CANNOT BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE. IT IS A RECORDING OF THE LICENSE PLATE NOT THE FACES OF THE INDIVIDUAL FOR PRIVACY ISSUES. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT ANYBODY ELSE COULD GET A COPY OF THE VIDEO IS IF THERE'S A COURT-ORDER. THAT A JUDGE HAS DETERMINED THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ON THEIR BEHALF VIDEO THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME SO WE'VE TRIED TO SEAL OFF THE THE USE OF THE VIDEO FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO IDENTIFY THAT LICENSE PLATE ISSUE -- I OR WARNING TO BUT MORNING OR A TICKET TO THE TO THE DRIVER AT TO THE VEHICLE VIOLATOR YES THE VEHICLE MY LATER. AND ONCE A CITATION IS ISSUED. FROM THE RECIPIENT OF THE CITATION HAS. EVERY RIGHT TO APPEAL SHOULD THEY CHOOSE. TO THE CITATION THAT'S CORRECT IT'S IT'S TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER VEHICLE CODE VIOLATION AND FRANKLY THERE'S THERE IS IT SET UP SO THAT THERE'S THERE'S A A WARNING AND THEN -- AND THEN A PERIOD DURING WHICH THERE'S ANOTHER WARNING AND YOU'RE YOU'RE GIVEN A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES TO VIOLATE WITHOUT THERE IS ACTUALLY BEING A TICKET. AND FRANKLY IF A POLICE OFFICER. SEE SOMEONE. VIOLATE THIS PARTICULAR LAW -- THAT THE LAW THAT UNDER DISCUSSION IF A POLICE OFFICER SEES THAT WITH ALL OF THE FEES AND THE FINES THAT GET ACCUMULATED ON A ON A MOVING VIOLATION NOT ONLY WOULD THEY END UP WITH A POINT ON THE RECORD. BUT THEY WOULD ALSO BE PAYING OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE FINE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THIS IS IT AS AS A DIFFERENT SCENARIO RIDDICK TRYING TO GET COMPLIANCE. THROUGH MY MORE MECHANIZED -- UP PROCESS EDDIE YOU PREVENT FALSE POSITIVES FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD -- AND THE REASON I ASK THIS I CAME ACROSS THE CARQUINEZ STRAITS I PAID MY TOLL. ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER I GOT A CITATION IN THE MAIL WITH A PHOTO OF MY LICENSE PLATE. IN AN EIGHTEEN DOLLAR FINE. I HAD A RIGHT TO GO APPEAL IT I THINK IN MARTINEZ IN MISS A DAY OF WORK I SENT A CHECK FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. AND NOW I ALWAYS ASK FOR A RECEIPT -- BUT HOW DO YOU AVOID SOMEBODY RECEIVING THAT CITATION IN THE MAIL. EXCELLENT QUESTION WELL THERE IS A THERE IS A PROTECTION THAT YOU CAN SWEAR UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY IT WASN'T YOU. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE TICKET. THANK YOU LOOK I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT YOU GET INTO THIS AND DON'T WANNA GET LOST IN THE NUMBER ONE OBJECTIVE WHICH IS PROTECTING THE LIVES OF CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO I HAD A QUESTION -- IF YOU WERE IF YOU'VE GOT THE ARM DOWN THE VIDEOS FLOWING AND YOU SEE A KIDNAPPING. AND IT'S ON TAPE. I WOULD HOPE THAT IN OUR EARNESTNESS TO KEEP THIS -- IT'S LIMITED TO THAT FUNCTION THAT IF THERE IS A CRIMINAL ACT. OF THAT IS IN FACT OBSERVED ON THE TAPE HA HA TOOK [inaudible] I THEY CAN BILL OKAY BUT I BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT THE IN YOUR IN YOUR SCENARIO IF THE KIDNAPPER ISN'T USING A VEHICLE. THEN IT'S THE VEHICLE IT THAT SETS OFF THE CAMERA OKAY WELL THAT WHAT MY CONCERN IS F YOU'VE GOT IT CAUGHT ON TAPE. YEAH THE NOTION THAT IT THAT IT HAS TO BE DESTROYED WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE SOMETHING LIKE THAT A AND PERHAPS WE CAN CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE AGAIN WE THAT'S TRUE. AND I THINK THE THIRTY DAYS I THINK THE THIRTY DAYS ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT SOMETIMES. POLITICALLY WITH THE OUR POLICE OFFICERS GOING TO TELL US THAT THEY'RE PRETTY WELL MAXED OUT IN SOMETIMES I CAN'T GET TO IT THEY CERTAINLY BEEN USING THAT EXCUSE WHY THEY CAN'T TEST RAPE KITS FOR WILL FOR YEARS SO. I THINK GIVING THEM THIRTY DAYS ISN'T TOO AND BUT APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS I THINK THAT WE HAVE TIGHTEN THE SUB DRAMATICALLY -- I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER CONCERNS IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I AND I'M SURE APPRECIATE ALWAYS THE HL YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRIVACY. THIS ONE MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BIT OF BALANCE GOING FORWARD BUT I I I CERTAINLY THINK YOU'VE IMPROVE THE BILL TREMENDOUSLY AND WITH THAT. THERE'S A MOTION BY SENATOR BORCHERS -- THE CENTER CUBBY YEAR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE QUESTIONS AND IN THE COMMENTS -- WE'VE WORKED REAL HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING CARE OF IT AS MANY OF THE CONCERNS AS POSSIBLE AND SO. ON I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS AIM RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FLOOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS. BORDERS AYE ALLEN. ALLEN I COVER EURO. CABALLERO I'D JONES. MORNING. MONEY AYE STERN STERN I BURKE. WHITE HOUSE SKI HI BUT BECAUSE HE AYE. ALL RIGHT THAT BILL HAS SEVEN VOTE AND WE WILL HOLD THE ROLL OVER OPEN FOR THE APPS MEMBER THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT SENATOR COVER YEAR ARE YOU HAVE ONE MORE IT'S FILE ITEM. FOURTEEN WHICH IS S. BEFORE. SEVENTY TWO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ALL RIGHT THIS IS THE AGAIN WE HAVE A AMENDMENTS. ON PAGE. SIXTEEN TO NINETEEN COMMENTS SIX ARE. OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE TAKING THOSE AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT GREAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS BOB FIRST LET ME THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE CHAIR FOR THEIR DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK AND AS ARTICULATED WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN SECTION SIX OF THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE. SIXTEEN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PART 2% SB FOUR SEVENTY TWO WHICH PROVIDES STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO REGULATE EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ALLOW CONSUMERS TO ACCESS A PORTION OF THE WAGES THEY HAVE ALREADY EARNED PRIOR TO THEIR SCHEDULED PAYDAY. HERE IS HOW A SIMPLE PROGRAM WORKS. A CONSUMER REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO HIS OR HER MONEY BUT THEIR CHECK IS NOT. READY TO BE PAID. USING AN APP THE CONSUMER AN QUICKLY ACCESS UP TO HALF OF THE AMOUNT OF HIS OR HER HER. ALREADY EARNED ON PAID INCOME DURING A GIVEN PAY PERIOD FOR A SINGLE FIXED FEE. THIS FEE IS NON RECURRING AND ONLY PAID IF AND WHEN A CONSUMER CHOOSES TO USE THE PROGRAM. AND THE FEE IS LESS THAN A TYPICAL BANK OVERDRAFT FEE OR A LATE FEE. WITH A FEW SCREEN CAPS USERS CAN HAVE INSTANT ACCESS TO THEIR ALREADY EARNED. UNPAID WAGES WHETHER IT'S TO COVER AN UNEXPECTED COST OR JUST TO AVOID A LATE -- OVERDRAFT FEES SOMETIMES PEOPLE NEED A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY IN FACT 70% OF THE U. S. HOUSEHOLDS LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK EVEN PEOPLE OF MEANS. AND FINANCE CHARGES INTEREST PAYMENTS CHECK CASHING FEES LATE FEES ON MONTHLY BILLS AND OTHER AND UNEXPECTED EXPENSES CAN OFTEN RUN AS MUCH AS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS FINANCIAL TAX IS A HIGHLY REGESSIVE TAX IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO WERE. OFTEN AT LEAST ABLE TO PAY. BY CREATING A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS WE CAN PROVIDE A SAFE. A SAFE WAY FOR CONSUMER TO GET THEIR MONEY WHEN THEY NEED IT IT'S A TOOL FOR PEOPLE TO USE THAT COMES WITH GUARD RAILS PROTECTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY. NEED TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED. THERE IS NO DEBT CREATED FOR A CONSUMER ACCESSING THEIR CURRENT AND PAINT INCOME. THERE IS NO INTEREST CHARGE. THERE THERE IS NO RECOURSE AND NO LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF NON PAYMENT THERE IS NO REPORTING OF NON PAYMENT TO A CREDIT BUREAU. AND THEREFORE A CONSUMER'S CREDIT CREDIT SCORE IS NOT AFFECTED AND SINCE IT'S NOT ALONE USERS CANNOT DEFAULT AND THERE IS NO COMPOUND IS INTEREST IN OR THE POSSIBILITY OF A COLLECTION AS A DEBT. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING SAFE AND INEXPENSIVE WAY FOR FOLKS TO GET ACCESS. TO THE MONEY THAT THEY NEED THEN WE NEED MUST CONTINUE TO HAVE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY I'M THANKFUL TO THE CONSUMER GROUPS LABOR AND OTHER EARNED INCOME ACCESS COMPANIES. FOR CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I WANT TO REPEAT THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER YEAH A PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE THEIR INPUT IN THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT AND WITH ME IN IN SUPPORT. IS DAN QUAN WHO IS MOST RECENTLY SERVED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS SENIOR ADVISER TO THE DIRECTOR RICHARD CORDRAY AT THE CONSUMER FIND FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND MY COMPANY -- ON BEHALF OF ACTIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY CARPENTER ON BEHALF OF PAY ACT OF THE SPONSOR WERE EXCITED IN TWOS TO SPONSOR THIS BILL -- AS THE SENATOR JUST SAID EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS ARE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. INNOVATIVE AND COMPLETELY CONSUMER DRIVEN PROGRAMS THAT SIMPLY ALLOW WORKERS AND CONSUMERS TO ACCESS A PORTION OF THE WAGES THEY'VE ALREADY EARNED. IN ORDER TO BETTER MANAGE THEIR BETWEEN PAYCHECK -- CASH FLOW NEEDS WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF AND THEN MADAM CHAIR AND HER STAFF. AND THE OTHER EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROVIDERS THE CONSUMER GROUPS AND AND THEY'LL LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TO OF ENGAGE WITH US AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK -- TO FASHION A STRONG STATUTORY REGIME -- THE REASON WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS DON'T FIT INTO ANY EXISTING REGULATORY CONSTRUCT. AND SO -- THE DPO HAS ASKED US TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE SEEKING THAT STATUTORY -- TORY CLARITY. THIS BILL DOES JUST THAT IT PROVIDES FOR THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK WE NEED. IT CREATES STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IT IMPOSES MEANINGFUL CONSUMER FRIENDLY REQUIREMENTS ON THE PROVIDERS OF EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS. OUR DATA SHOWS THE VALUE OF THESE PROGRAMS IN HELPING CONSUMERS MANAGE THEIR MONEY AND AVOID DEATH TRAPS. 31% OF OUR CONSUMERS ACCESS THEIR INCOME IN ORDER TO AVOID PAYING -- OVERDRAFT FEES 38% ACCIDENTS. ARE THERE IN THEIR OWN ICOME TO AVOID PAYING LATE FEES ON ROUTINE BILLS SUCH AS PHONE BILLS AND OTHER BILLS AND 22%. OF OUR CONSUMERS USE THESE. OPPORTUNITIES TO AVOID TAKING OUT PAYDAY LOANS SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE FAR LESS RISKY AND FOR LESS EXPENSIVE FOR CONSUMERS. CASH STRAPPED CONSUMERS WHO MAKING TO MANAGE THEIR MONEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DAN CALL I AM MOST RECENT IS SERVING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS SOON TO THE VISOR TO DIRECTOR RICHARD CORDRAY. THE CFPB WHERE I LEAD A FEEDBACK OFFICE ONE OF OUR KEY ACHIEVEMENTS WAS FACILITATING EARNED INCOME ACCESS OR EIA A INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY THAT DISRUPTS SHORT TERM HIGH COST CREDIT PRODUCTS. THE CFPB CLOSE THE EXAM THE AYE PROGRAMS AND CONCLUDED THAT HE AYE PROVIDES A SAFE AND INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO SHORT TERM CONSUMER LOANS. AS A RESULT IN HIS FINAL PAY THE RULE RELEASING LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CFPB CREATED A SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS. TO ACCOMMODATE RESPONSIBLE YEAH A MODELS THOSE EXEMPTIONS REQUIRE THE EIA PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE MEANINGFUL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THE PROGRAMS WERE NOT PREDATORY. AND SENATOR CABALLERO HAS INCORPORATED A MANY SUCH CAR REELS IN HER BILL. A FEW KEY POINTS ALL WHAT. IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT. YEAH I IS NOT CREDIT. WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY THE CITY BE DECISION TO EXAM T. I. A FROM THE ABILITY TO REPAY REQUIREMENT IN HIS FINAL PAY THE RULE. NO FUTURE WAGES ARE IMPLICATED NOTE THAT OBLIGATION IS CREATED NO INTEREST IS CHARGED NO COLLATERAL OR SECURITY INTERESTS YOU TAKEN FROM THE EMPLOYEE CONSUMER OR EMPLOYER NOW SECOND. YEAH I IS A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE WHILE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE ME MARKET FORCES I UNDERSTAND -- WHY STATES WANTING STILL -- PRICE CAPS SO IN THIS CASE THIS BILL INSTALLED A STRICT CAP OF FOURTEEN DOLLARS. A MONTHLY FEES WHICH MAKES THESE PROGRAMS FAR LESS EXPENSIVE THAN PAYDAY LOANS LATE FEES AND BANK OVERDRAFT FEES. YEAH I IS BY THE VERY STRUCTURE. A FAR LESS RISK ALTERNATIVE. THE FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE THERE'S NO DEBT CREATED THE CONSUMER DOES NOT AWAITING THEY CREATE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDENS FOR THEMSELVES SECOND THIS BILL REQUIRES THE EIA SHALL BE COMPLETELY NON RECOURSE. IF THE CONSUMER DOESN'T PAY. THEY'RE STILL HELD COMPLETELY HARMLESS. THIRDS THIS BILL CAPS THE AMONG THE CONSUMER TO ACCESSING EACH PAY PERIOD THIS IS FOR THE CULTURAL ALWAYS HOW FUNDS AVAILABLE ON THE ACTUAL PAYDAY TO MEET OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. FORCE THIS BILL PROHIBITS PROVIDERS FROM COMPELLING CONSUMERS TO ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM AS A PRECONDITION TO RECEIVE THE I A THANK YOU VERYMUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. I JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE UP ACTIVE C. O. O. WHO IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY. THANK YOU TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THE JAZZ ON WAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. A TERM MEMBERS IS AND MARTIN DEL CONSUMER REPORTS FORMALLY CONSUMERS UNION WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL A VERY APPRECIATE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OTHERS WILLING TO TAKE AMENDMENTS AND WE WILL KEEP WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WIENER SOIR LET'S START WITH THE TWO WINNERS AND THEN WE'LL GO. TO OF WELL WOMEN. WE HAVE -- TOWARD. WHO IS IT IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION? ALL RIGHT THEY WILL LET THE TWEETERS COME IN AND BE THE OPPOSITION AND AT LEAST FOR PURPOSES OF EACH HAVING TWO MINUTES EACH TO SPEAK BUT I'M SURE MEMBERS DUNCAN MCFETRIDGE REPRESENTING DAILY PAY I HAVE HERE -- JASON LEE THE CEO OF THE COMPANY WE WANT TO THANK -- SIR CABALLERO AND HER STAFF FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE WE THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE PRODUCT -- ONE THAT WILL HELP CONSUMERS IMMENSELY -- HOWEVER WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- WITH THE BILL WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH CENTER CUT YOUR BUT WE WANTED TO LET THE COMMITTEE -- NO ABOUT -- DALY PAYS CONCERNS. SURE AND I KNOW IT'S LATE SO I'LL KEEP IT SHORT -- MY NAME'S JASON LEE ON THE CEO OF DAILY PAY. DILLON PAYS A SOFTWARE PROVIDER. TO EMPLOYERS AND PAYROLL COMPANIES -- AND WE DO A VERY VERY SIMPLE THING. OUR SOFTWARE ENABLES EMPLOYERS TO OFFER TO THEIR EMPLOYEES ACCESS TO THEIR OWN MONEY. YOU CAN THINK OF US A BIT LIKE AN ATM MACHINE. WHEN YOU GO TO AN ATM MACHINE YOU CAN ACCESS ALL OF YOUR MONEY? THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS YOUR MONEY. EARN WAGES ARE THE EMPLOYEES MONEY. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WHEN AN EMPLOYEE QUITS OR IS ACTUALLY TERMINATED BEFORE PAYDAY. SHE IN FACT GETS ACCESS TO ALL OF OUR MONEY SHE DOES NOT FOREGO ANY OF THAT PAY SIMPLY BECAUSE PAID IS NOT OCCURRED. NOW WE ARE SUPPORTIVE. OF SB. FOUR SEVENTY TWO BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL PROVISIONS. HIS WITH HIS MILITARY OF SOME QUIET ON THE DíAS PLEASE SO THAT WE CAN HEAR THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESSES. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE. OF THE INTENT BEHIND US BEFORE SEVENTY TWO BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL PROVISIONS THAT CREATE UNINTENDED AND IN SOME CASES HIDDEN COST. FOR THE CONSUMER. NOW THESE COSTS MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS TO A NON PRACTITIONER. BUT AS THE PREMIER PROVIDER IN THE MARKET PLACE WE HAVE A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE. AND DATA. ABOUT THE OPTIMAL FORMS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. MOREOVER THIS BILL COULD LIMIT THE EMPLOYER AND CONSUMERS CHOICE TO AVAIL HERSELF OF OTHER MODELS IN THE MARKETPLACE. FOR EXAMPLE OUR COMPANY DAILY PAY HAS A VERY DIFFERENT MODEL. AND IT'S ONE THAT IS USED TODAY BY WARREN BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. ATP THE LARGEST CABLE PROVIDER IN THE COUNTRY. AND BURGER KING. CAN I ASK YOU TO STOP I'M SURE THERE WILL BE FURTHER QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE THAT WILL BRING THOSE FORWARD IN OUR DISCUSSION APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY BUT LET'S GET ON WITH THE OR ARE YOU A TWEENER OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT IF YOU WOULD STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE ENSURE BETTER BECOME AFTER THE NATIONAL PAYROLL REPORTING CONSORTIUM THE PAYROLL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY AS WELL. HAS GREAT POTENTIAL WE DO THINK THIS NEED TO BE A THOUGHTFUL COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION THERE SOME COMPLICATED ISSUES AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH DOCTOR AND THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE. IN STRONG NEUTRALITY OR OPPOSITION. OUR EIGHTEEN HEARING NONE. OF LET'S GO TO OF THE DIET SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR IN TRYING TO CREATE THIS -- AVAILABILITY TURNED WAGES FOR EMPLOYEES. MY QUESTION AND IT WAS PARTIALLY RAISED BY THE WINNERS. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY PAYING ACTIVE IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT. IT'S A COMPANY THAT STANDS TO BENEFIT SHOULD THIS BECOME LAW. THEY ARE ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE THE STANDARD BENEFIT THAT IS CORRECT [inaudible] IN. HOW DO OTHER COMPANIES BENEFIT OR? BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST SHOULD THE BILL AS SUPPORTED BY PAYING ACTIVE MOVES THROUGH. WELL IT'S IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER BILL WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE IN THE THE THE DIFFERENT PRACTICES AND YOU TRY TO MODEL THE BILL SO THAT IT'S IT IT IT IS INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE. SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE TAKEN OR SOME OF THE CUTS CONSTRUCT THAT WE'VE TAKEN HAVE BEEN ADVOCATE GROUPS. THAT BOMB HAVE -- THAT HAVE BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT. INDIVIDUALS CAN ACCESS THEIR MONEY AND THEY WANT SOME THE BIGGER GUARD RATE WE'VE BEEN TRIED TO PUT THE GUARD RAILS ON IT THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT -- I THINK WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS TO REACH OUT AND TO GET AS MANY OF THAT. PRACTITIONERS AS POSSIBLE AND MAKE THE THE DETAILS OF HOW. AS BROAD AS POSSIBLE BUT STILL WITH THE GUARDRAILS THAT PROTECT% CONSUMERS. WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO THAT AND AGAIN. I'D I'D LIKE TO ASK MISTER LEE MAYBE JUST FINISH HIS CONCERNS BECAUSE FOR ME I ALWAYS HAVE A CONCERN. WHEN THERE'S LEGISLATION? THAT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'S IT'S BROUGHT IN THE INTEREST OF A SINGLE COMPANY -- AND YOU KNOW I THINK FOR ALL OF US SOME RED FLAGS GO UP AROUND THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT -- TO THE SPONSOR THIS BILL IS JUST. WERE IN AN OPEN COMPETITIVE MARKET PLACE IN WHEN THE LEGISLATURE SHOULDN'T BE TEAMING UP. PERSPECTIVE BUSINESS ADVANTAGE FOR SINGLE COMPANY SO WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ASK. MISTER LEE IS THAT CORRECT SHARKS. WHAT? WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR THIS BILL TO CREATE -- FAIR ACCESS TO THESE PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE I THINK OUR OVERALL REACTION IS THE BILL IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS SOME STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND STATUTORY CLARIFICATION THAT'S REQUIRED GIVEN THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING -- BOTH ACTIVE IN OURSELVES AND A FEW OTHERS SORT OF FALLS WITHIN THE CRACKS -- OF THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE. AND REGULATORY SCHEMA MY VIEW THOUGH IS THE BILL PROBABLY DOES TOO MUCH -- I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS IN THE BILL -- POTENTIALLY COULD BE PERCEIVED AS FAVORING ONE MODEL OVER ANOTHER AND SO I THINK THE ONUS. OR THE THE AT THE PRIMARY DRIVER BEHIND THIS IS QUITE ADMIRABLE WHICH IS TO PROVIDE THAT STATUTORY CLARIFICATION. BUT THAT'S PROBABLY ALL THAT'S REALLY NEEDED AT THIS POINT TO ENSURE THAT THE MARKET PLACE DEVELOPS FAIRLY.% THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ANALYSTS TO THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION. IN TO THE AUTHOR WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I AM ME. HOLD OFF TODAY ON THIS SEE HOW IT PERCOLATES -- AS IT MOVES FORWARD BUT THANK YOU. I ED THE TWO HAD AONG MY QUESTIONS -- THE FACT THAT -- IT APPEARED THAT THIS BILL WAS FOCUSING ON A THE BUSINESS MODEL OF ONE COMPANY WHICH HAS. A CENTER MINING INDICATES IS. INAPPROPRIATE FOR US AS A LEGISLATURE. I AM I AM CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT -- WE HAVE SEEN WITH SO MUCH OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE SEEN. NO GUIDELINES NO REGULATIONS AND THE US WE HAVE SEEN A WILD WEST AMONG SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. SO THAT WHEN WE FINALLY REALIZED THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WE'RE TOLD HE WILL DESTROY OUR BUSINESS MODEL -- SO FOR ME I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT SETTING SOME GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS TO ASSURE THAT. THIS THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS AND WHAT OUR DEMANDS -- WILL BE IS PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. ENCOURAGING THE KINDS OF EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT DO EXIST WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY SO -- I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT -- YOU THINK THAT THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH. DIRECTION GIVEN HERE -- KEEPING IN MIND THAT WE WANT TO GIVE DIRECTION FOR WHOEVER IS GOING TO BE THE NET APP PRODUCE THE NEXT PRODUCT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EMPLOYEES TO ACTUALLY ACCESS THE REAL MONEY. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS -- AND AT THE SAME TIME A RECOGNIZING UNLIKE PAYDAY LENDERS WHO CHARGES EXORBITANT RATES ON THE THEORY THAT THE RISK IS HIGH. THERE'S NO RISK HERE BECAUSE THE MONEY'S ALREADY BEEN ORINDA JUST HASN'T BEEN TRANSFERRED. I DO YOU HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT ARE PERHAPS -- SENATOR CAFIERO COULD CONSIDER GOING FORWARD -- THAT WOULD RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS FIELD ON A FROM MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS. WELL AT THE SAME TIME GIVING GUIDANCE TO THIS NEWLY EMERGING INDUSTRY. AND I'D ARE VITAMIN FROM YOU WHEN FROM THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL [inaudible] SURE AN LOOK LET ME START BY SAYING THE PERIL HASN'T CHANGED IN ABOUT TWO CENTURIES. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE -- IS VERY CUTTING EDGE AND IT DOES REQUIRE A FAIR AMOUNT OF THOUGHT -- AND REALLY DELIBERATE CONSIDERATION -- AROUND ALL OF THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS AROUND TRYING TO CHANGE THINGS WITH PAYROLL. HAVING SAID THAT -- I THINK AS A COMPANY -- AND CERTAINLY AS WE SURVEY EMPLOYERS AND OUR USERS THE THING THAT IS VERY APPARENT IS. FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'VE ALREADY EARNED THESE WAGES. IT IS THEIR MONEY AS AS AS YOU SAID MANAGE IT ALREADY IS THERE MONEY THEY'VE ALREADY EARNED IT. AND SO ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT AT LEAST WE HAVE HELD OURSELVES TO IT'S ENSURING THAT EMPLOYEES CAN ACCESS THAT WHEN THEY WANT. IT IS A LITTLE BIT ODD THAT SOMEONE HAS TO QUIT A JOB. IN ORDER FOR HER TO ACTUALLY GET EVERYTHING THAT IS DUE -- TO AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DO SEE SITUATIONS LIKE THAT WHERE SOMEONE IS IN SUCH DIRE CONSTRAINTS. BECAUSE THEY NEED TO PAY A BILL THAT THE WIND UP QUITTING A JOB. JUST SO THEY CAN GET. WHAT IS ACTUALLY -- TO THEM SINCE PAID IS NOT UNTIL NEXT WEEK AND SO ONE I THINK VERY IMPORTANT PREMISE HERE. IS THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RESTRICTING THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO THE AND EMPLOYEE. VERSUS GIVING HER WHAT IS ALREADY HERS AND WHAT SHE'S ALREADY AREN'T. I UNDERSTAND AS A BROADER DIALOGUE TO BE HAD AROUND THAT TOPIC BUT I THINK THAT IS ONE THING THAT I WOULD JUST MARK -- AS ONE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS SPACE. OF FROM THE SUPPORT IS THE BILL. APPETITE THANK YOU -- THE IT JUST BE FROM BE ACTIVE. TOOL FOR SO FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO ALLEVIATE TO CONCERN A PERCEPTION THAT YOU KNOW THIS WAS A ONE ONE COMPANY BILL BECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE BILL CONSIST OR OR CONSISTENT TALES. A BUSINESS MODEL THAT WE DON'T EVEN OPERATE AS AN EXAMPLE -- BECAUSE THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER MODEL FOOL V. BEEF LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS -- AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AND Vì WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE DOING THAT OUR HOT ON ACCESS TO OWN BRIDGES IS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE GIVEN IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER -- NOT UNRESTRICTED MANNER SO YES WE CAN WORK ON THE FREQUENCY OF GIVING MAYBE MORE FREQUENCY THAN WHAT THE BILL TODAY ALLOWS. BUT BE PHILOSOPHICALLY OR PRACTICALLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS -- TO AND INCOME WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION -- THEY SHOULD BE SOME GUARDRAILS IT SHOULD BE GIVEN IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER BECAUSE BE HERE REALLY. AT THIS POINT TO BE A NOT PREPARED TO GET PAID EVERY DAY AND WE HAVE DONE SOME HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN STUDIES ON IT -- AND SO YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE A PERSON. VINDICATE PAID ON PAYDAY THEY HAVE A ZERO CHECK. CORRECT SOLD THAT'S KIND OF J. BUT GIVEN THE MIDDLE GROUND GIVEN TO WORK WITH THEM ABSOLUTELY -- BUT PHILOSOPHICALLY V. BELIEVE -- AND WHAT OUR PRACTICE AND PRODUCT SHOWS THAT RESPONSIBLE AXIS IS THE WAY TO PROCEED. SENATOR OF Y. CASKEY WERE SMILING THE ONE STATION THEM FALL BY SENATOR STERN IS I THINK. AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL IT'S LIKE NOT STICK THERE ARE SIX PLAYERS IN THIS BUSINESS. SOME OF THEM HAVE DIRECT CONSUMER ACCESS THEY TALK TO THE CONSUMER AND THEY SAY CONSUMER YOU DECIDE WHAT MONEY YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT OF YOUR YOUR PAYCHECK THE OTHERS WORK WITH THE WITH THE EMPLOYERS AND THEY ACCESS THE EMPLOYERS. YOUR BUSINESS ALLOWS. PEOPLE TO COME IN EVERY DAY TAKE OUT EVERYONE F. AS MUCH MONEY AS THE URINE IN AS ACT TO PAY HAS SAID WHICH WE HAVE SO YOU COULD. GET TO PAY THE WITH ZERO YOU'RE A FREE MARKET MODEL WHICH IS YOU KNOW OKAY THAT SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THE BILL IN ANY OF IN ANY WAY LIMITS THE SIX DIFFERENT PLAYERS YOU KNOW YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU YOU HAVE ACCESS TO DO IT. IT'S POTENTIALLY UP TO THE EMPLOYER THAT WILL SAY I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE FIFTY FOR A DAY TAKE MONEY OUT THAT'S AN EMPLOYER. AGREEMENT WITH THE EMPLOYER AND THEN THE QUESTION IS IS THAT IF CAN THE DOUBLE DIP CAN THE CONSUMER. USE ONE SERVICE THAT. AT THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER TO ACTIVATE UP 250% AND THEN GO AROUND AND GO WITH THE CONSUMER -- TO THE DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER MODEL AND TAKE MORE I MEAN I GUESS. MY ECONOMY OR ECONOMICS PROFESSOR WOULD SAY THAT'S UP TO THE CONSUMER RIGHT AT ME. BUT I'D. IS THAT A FEAR REPRESENTATION WE ARE IN THIS BILL TODAY. YEAH JUST ONE SMALL CLARIFICATION AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M IF I HAVE THIS WRONG. I THINK THE BILL TECHNICALLY AS A THREAT AND DOES HAVE A STATUTORY LIMITATION OF 50% -- HOWEVER THE POINT THAT YOU'VE MADE IS A GOOD ONE SENATOR WHICH IS. OFTENTIMES IN THESE MODELS YOU DO WHAT THE EMPLOYER CHOOSE. AND SO CERTAINLY WE WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF JUST HAVING THE EMPLOYER CHOOSE THE EMPLOYER TYPICALLY KNOWS -- THE EMPLOYEE BASE THE PAST -- THEY HAVE A BUILT IN INCENTIVE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE RIGHT FOR THE EMPLOYEE BASE -- AND SO CERTAINLY WE THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD COMPROMISE [inaudible] SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MENTORED IN LIGHT OF THE AGNOSTICISM THAT I FEEL IS THE INTENSE [inaudible] MY COLLEAGUE. MENTION I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. OTHER COMMENTS -- I APPRECIATE THIS WE NEED TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION I'M NOT SURE WE'RE GOING TO COME TO THE RESOLUTION. OF BLOOD WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL KEEP WORKING ON THIS -- AND THAT THIS DOES NOT REFLECT A BIAS IN FAVOR OF ONE OPTION VERSUS ANOTHER AND ALSO IN CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE -- GAMING THE SYSTEM SO THAT THEY END UP TRYING TO GET MORE THAN WHAT IS THEIR ENTITLEMENT TO OR THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES. IN DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT LEADS THEM INTO THE CONDITIONS OF THAT ARE GOING TO ULTIMATELY CREATE. SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS EITHER FOR THEM OF THEIR EMPLOYER -- AND I WISH YOU LUCK IN THAT -- WE HAVE A MOTION AND I AGAIN. SORT OF WATCHING CAREFULLY HOW THIS ALL PROCEEDS AND I APPRECIATE THE MEMBER'S YOU'VE TAKEN I THINK. THERE IS A LOT MORE DISCUSSION TO HAVE THIS IS OPENING UP NEW -- A NEW -- A FRONTIER BUT ONE THAT CLEARLY WE NEED TO START MOVING INTO SO THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR STERN TO PASS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SIXTIES WHEN I'M NOT TRYING TO HURRY ANYBODY I DON'T KNOW I I I APPRECIATE -- YOU MOVING THINGS ALONG BUT I'M VERY SENSITIVE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS IS I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO ALLEGATIONS THAT I WOULD RUN A BILL. THAT TO SINGLE INDUSTRY BILL I THAT'S NOT HOW I OPERATE -- BUT THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF BILL THAT I WOULD DO AND THAT'S NOT WHICH HERE -- IT THIS IS REALLY AN ATTEMPT FOR US TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE. TO THE HIGH RISK LOANS. THAT ARE THAT ARE THE ONLY OPTION THAT THAT WHEN YOU HAVE NO MONEY THAT YOU YOUR FOR YOUR FORCED TO USE AND SO -- WE WE'VE BEEN VERY -- ENGAGE WITH THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE GROUPS IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'VE GOT THE GUARD RAILS AND THE LIMITATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO ALL OF THE OTHER -- COMPANIES THAT ARE ARE THINKING ABOUT OFFERING THIS KIND OF A MODEL OR ALREADY DO SOMEWHERE ELSE -- BUT BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH WITH THE THAT WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S REASONABLE THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE. TO ACCESS THEIR CASH IT DOESN'T LEAVE THEM WITH NO MONEY AT THE END OF THE MONTH -- BECAUSE AND THEN WE HAVEN'T SOLVED THE PROBLEM SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OF THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FLOOR. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HIGH JACKSON AYE BORDERS. BORDERS AYE ALLEN. ALLEN I COME HERE ALL. CABALLERO AYE JONES. JONES I MONNING [inaudible] STERN. I BURKE. NUMBER TWO I Y. CASKEY HI MY COUNCIL RIGHT THE VOTE COUNTY IS EIGHT TWO EIGHT TWO ZERO AND WE HAVE A FULL HOUSE SO THAT BILL. IS OUT AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A FIVE MINUTE. OF RECESS BOB. BEFORE WE HEAR SENATOR UMBERG'S BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU WE HAVE THREE MORE BILLS. ARE WE GOING TO START WITH FILE ITEM NUMBER. SIXTEEN SENATOR UMBERG EUROPE. FILE ITEM SIXTEEN THIS IS SB -- FIVE FORTY FOUR THANK YOU AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. VERY QUICK -- FIRST LET ME LET ME ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE PRESENCE OF SENATOR STERN'S PARENTS -- HERE NEARLY THEY DID NOT WANT LEAVING HOME ALONE SO -- ALL RIGHT SO -- YEAH YEAH -- THE MANAGER AND SEVEN IS BEFORE YOU IS SB FIVE FORTY FOUR AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT ISSUE IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. IS THAT -- IF YOU APPLY FOR THE STATE BAR ADMISSIONS STATE BAR YOU FILL AN APPLICATION IF IN THAT APPLICATION YOU INDICATE THERE'S ANY ISSUE -- WHETHER IT WAS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL IF YOU HAVE EVEN HAVE A MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION. THEN -- YOU ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A WAIVER TO THE STATE BAR CAN ACCESS ALL SORTS OF RECORDS INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS THAT IT PROVIDES A A CHILLING EFFECT FOR FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE HAD COUNSELING. VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT'S NOT A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE THAT IS A REAL EXAMPLE -- SAME THING WITH VETERANS WITH PTSD IF YOU'VE GOT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES YOU BASICALLY ARE GIVING THE STATE BAR. THE ABILITY AND INDEED THEY DO ACCESS THOSE RECORDS AND SO -- A NUMBER OF STATES VIRGINIA IN LOUISIANA AND THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION SAYS LOOK AT WE WE SHOULDN'T BE WE AS A PROFESSION AND AND WE AS A STATE SHOULDN'T BE. EXAMINING FOLKS MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS IN DUE COURSE AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT IT IT. BASICALLY PROVIDES THAT -- THE STATE BAR MAY NOT EXCEPT FOR IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE APPLICANT HIMSELF OR HERSELF DECIDES THAT THEY WANT TO PROVIDE THOSE MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS TO THE TO THE BAR COMMITTEE. SO I IS YOU POINT OUT MAN I'M SURE THERE IS NO OPPOSITION AND I WOULD -- DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU SO THAT WERE CLEAR ARE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I'M SORRY -- CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT WE BELIEVE SUCH A REQUEST IS INDEED A VIOLATION OF THE ADA. VERY GOOD WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ART A QUICK QUESTION WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT MEDICAL RECORDS NOT ABOUT PERHAPS A CRIMINAL CONVICTION IT'S BOB BASED UPON. OF SOME KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT ARGUABLY IS FOUND TO HAVE HAD A MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH -- COMPONENT TO IT CORRECT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS THAT'S CORRECT MANAGER BUT FORGET. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DIE SENATOR ON SECURE WHICH IS AN OR BERG -- I I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THIS -- UNTIL UNTIL YOU BROUGHT IT UP BUT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT YOU COULD HAVE FOLKS ON WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN APPLYING THE LAW SCHOOL. OR BECOMING -- APPLYING FOR MEMBERSHIP TO THE BAR AND IF THEY HAVE -- BACKGROUND THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT MIGHT DISSUADE THEM SO I THINK THAT THAT IS HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD. IF THERE WERE A SITUATION DOWN THE ROAD WHERE. SOMEONE'S MENTAL CONDITION -- WOULD REVEAL ITSELF -- AND THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE COUNSEL TO THE CLIENT -- WOULD THERE BE A SITUATION WHERE AT ANY POINT THERE THROUGH DISCOVERY OFFER MALPRACTICE FOR MALPRACTICE ACTION WITH THAT INFORMATION EVER COME OUT AT THAT POINT. BILL -- SO THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I DON'T KNOW THE AND SO SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY SOMEONE HAS INVADED SOMEONE'S THE THE THE YOU IS LAWYER RECEIVED. MONEY IN SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM AND YOU FAILED TO PROVIDE TO THE COUNT TO THE CLIENT AND THEN YOU'RE BEING DISCIPLINED AND AND FOLKS WANT TO EXAMINE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER YOU'VE SOME SORT OF MENTAL DEFICIENCY. THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THIS MAY BE A CONTINUING PATTERN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THIS THIS BILL SIMPLY. ADDRESSES ISSUES CONCERNING THE APPLICATION TO THE BARD NOT A CURRENT NOT MEMBERS OF THE BAR. RIGHT NOT BEHAVIOR GOING FORWARD RIGHT I THOUGHT AND I THINK IT SOLVES -- IN ISSUE THAT -- I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT EXIST BUT I THINK IN ANECDOTALLY WE THINK IT DOES SO I'LL BE SUPPORTIVE. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MOTION BY SENATOR MONNING SENATOR UMBERG IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE -- THIS IS IMPORTANT BILL OR DRIVE A VERY GOOD. ALRIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE PORGES BORDERS AYE ALLEN. ALLEN I CABALLERO. COME HERE I JONES. JONES I MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN STERN I BURKE. NUMBER I WHAT HEALTHY I KELSEY AYE. ALL RIGHT NINE TWO ZERO THE BILL ITSELF THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG SENATOR BORCHERS SHE HEARS SIMPLE BILL IS UP NEXT. FILE ITEM. EIGHTEEN SENATE BILL. SIX FIFTY NINE SENATOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I FOR SOME REASON I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT -- COMMITTEE WAS GOING TO FINISH AT THREE THIRTY IT'S NOT HAPPY. WELL I WAS HOPING FIVE THIRTY BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED EITHER -- WITHIN I WILL -- GUY GO AS QUICKLY AS IS POSSIBLE -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. SIX FIVE NINE SENATE BILL SIX FIVE NINE WOULD AUTHORIZE A COURT TO WARD REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES TO THE PREVAILING PARTY. WHEN THE COURT FINDS THE OPPOSING PARTY USED ACTIONS TACTICS ARE CLAIMS? MADE ON REASONABLY OR IN BAD FAITH THAT ARE FRIVOLOUS OR INTENDED TO CAUSE UNNECESSARY DELAY. WITHIN THE LIMITED CONTEXT OF INFILL DEVELOPMENT. IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT HOUSING PRICES STATEWIDE ARE GROSSLY DISPROPORTIONATE TO AVERAGE INCOMES AND I CALIFORNIA'S SIMPLY BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL IN MEETING ITS NEEDS. AS MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS CONTINUE TO SUFFER THROUGH THE HOUSING CRISIS. MANY RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS ARE LEFT WITHOUT OPTIONS SINCE PROJECTS OR DELAYED AND MARKET COSTS MAKE HOUSING OUT OF REACH FOR MANY CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THE HARSH REALITY WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE STATUS QUO. IS INSUFFICIENT. AS A STANDALONE LOS SEQUEL ITSELF EXISTS FOR A VERY GOOD PURPOSE. AS FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY BOARD I APPRECIATE THE NEED TO PROTECT TO CONSERVE OUR PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES. AND ENVIRONMENT. JUST TO BE CLEAR HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE OR ALTER SYKORA. IN ANY WAY. INSTEAD THIS BILL AIMS TO DISSUADE LITIGANTS WHO ARE FILING SEQUEL LAWSUITS AGAINST INFILL HOUSING PROJECTS THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH PROTECTING PEOPLE OR THE ENVIRONMENT. A TWENTY EIGHTEEN SECRET STUDY CONDUCTED BY HALL IN AND NIGHT USE THREE YEARS WORTH OF EMPIRICAL DATA TO CONSIDER THE MOST COMMON TAUGHT TYPES. OF LAWSUITS ACTUALLY FILED UNDER SEEK WORK. RESEARCHERS OBTAIN COPIES OF EVERY SEQUEL PETITION SUBMITTED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS PUBLIC RESOURCES C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; CODE&lt;/c&gt;</u> TWO ONE ONE SIX SEVEN POINT SEVEN REQUIRES. A COPY OF THE COMPLAINT BE SENT TO THE AG. ALSO REQUIRED UNDER THE CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE THREE EIGHT EIGHT BECAUSE OF ALLEGATIONS OF POLLUTION OR ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS [inaudible] TO DATE. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY STUDY THAT HAS REFUTED THEIR DATAOR SUMMARY OF IT IN HERE TO KEY TAKE AWAY POINTS. 87% OF ALL LAWSUITS. WERE AGAINST INFILL TYPE PROJECTS RESIDENTIAL RETAIL TRANSIT 87%. THE SECOND FINDINGS THAT 49% OF ALL RESIDENTIAL SEQUEL LAWSUIT STATEWIDE TARGETED MULTI FAMILY HOMES. SO DEVELOPING MORE INFILL HOUSING ALSO DIRECTLY DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE CHANGE IN LAND USE PLANNING GOALS. AS OUTLINED IN THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES STRATEGY. JUST THIS LAST YEAR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD RELEASED A REPORT THAT STRONGLY STATED THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SPUR INFILL TYPE DEVELOPMENT IF THE STATE IS GOING TO MEET ITS CLIMATE CHANGE TARGETS. SET OUT BY SB THIRTY TWO WHICH CALLS FOR A 40% REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY. TWENTY THIRTY THE HARSHER REALITY. CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION IS NOT GETTING ANY SMALLER. AND THE GEOGRAPHY OF OUR STATE IS GETTING BIGGER. WE NEED IS NOT GETTING BIGGER WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE CITIES TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOT CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE A SYSTEM THAT ENCOURAGES LAWSUITS TO HOLD AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. IN ON THIS GOVERNOR NEW SOME IS RIGHT. GOVERNOR NEW SEVEN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS SAID THAT IT'S TIME FOR SEQUEL IMPROVEMENTS TO MEET OUR HOUSING NEEDS. WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED JOBS A WE NEED TO BREAK THE STATUS QUO IF WE WERE TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE SMART GROWTH WITHIN OUR CITIES. SB SIX FIVE NINE CREATES A MECHANISM FOR THAT BY AUTHORIZING THE COURT TO AWARD REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES. BY ENSURING ALL PARTIES ARE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH IN CHANGING THE REGULATORY STATUS QUO AROUND SEE WHAT WE CAN PARTIALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THAT HOLD INFILL HOUSING PROJECTS. IN BECAUSE COSTS TO SKYROCKET FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY. OUR ADAM RELATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA -- CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND COREY SMITH WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO HOUSING ACTION COALITION. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB SIX FIVE NINE AND WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT EVERYONE IS AWARE. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS -- AND AMENDMENTS MADE TO THIS -- BILL I BELIEVE THIS WAS FROM THE FROM THE COMMITTEE I WANNA MAKE CERTAIN EVERYONE HAS A CALL WHAT WHAT WHAT WAIT A SECOND AGES WHAT WHAT AMENDMENTS. THESE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVING COME FROM THE COMMITTEE. THESE ARE MOMENTS AT WHICH WAS PASSED OUT NOW SO THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT BILL -- WE OPERATING OFF OF AT THIS MOMENT I WE OPERATING OFF OF THE BILL THE TO IMPRINT THAT'S BEEN ANALYZED OR WE OPERATING ON A BILL WITH AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE JUST SEEN. WE ARE WE WILL BE OPERATING. ON AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PUT FORWARD AND APPARENTLY -- RECEIVED RECENTLY BY AND BY YOU AND AND THIS AND THE STAFF. WERE QUITE SIMPLY RECEIVED EXCUSE ME JUST RECEIVED LET'S BE CLEAR THESE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM THE COMMITTEE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS HE'S OR AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED. BY SENATOR UMBERG IN CHECK CORRECT. FOR THE MOST PART THAT'S CORRECTIVE THERE'S SOME OTHER FOLKS THAT ADDED INFORMATION BUT YES OKAY SO THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL -- WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO EXAMINE THIS DOCUMENT SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR WHAT'S BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND FRANKLY RICHEST TO ANALYZE SOME ANALYZING THEM AT THIS MOMENT A GOING FORWARD SO IT AS LONG AS WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR WHAT IT IS WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT A PROBLEM VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I THINK -- FOR EVERYONE'S. BENEFIT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WAS THE DELETION. THAT'S ALL THAT REALLY OCCURRED HERE AND THE THE NUMERICS THAT WERE ATTACHED OUR THAT WERE ADDED TO THIS WERE SIMPLY BREAKING DOWN AT A PRE EXISTING SENTENCE. AND SO IT IS. IF MY EYES DON'T FAIL ME -- THE THE COURT MAY APPOINT A MOTION OF A PARTY WORD REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES -- TO A PARTY IN ACTION OR PROCEEDING FILE PURSUANT TO THIS -- DIVISION IF THE COURT FINDS NUMBER ONE THE PARTY IS A PREVAILING PARTY -- AS DEFINED IN SECTION TEN THIRTY TWO OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. AND NUMBER TWO THE PIT PETITIONER USE ACTIONS TACTICS ARE CLAIMS THAT WERE BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING COLON. A MAIDEN REASONABLY ARE IN BAD FAITH AND BE FRIVOLOUS OR INTENT TO CAUSE UNNECESSARILY DELAY IS. AND AT THE REQUEST OF INDIVIDUALS -- WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS AND REMOVE THE WORD ON REASONABLY POSSIBLY PUTTING IN A SENATE NAM -- BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONSENSUS -- SO THE PROPORTIONALITY MADAM CHAIR. THE ONE SENSE PROPORTIONALITY WAS TAKEN OUT [inaudible] WELL. IN REVIEWING THE ORIGINAL BILL AND THEN THE AENDMENTS SOME MIGHT SAY THAT THIS WAS THE IN SPITE OF WHAT IS DELETED -- SOME MIGHT SAY THAT THIS IS. LIKE PUTTING LIPSTICK ON A PIG SO IT'S NOT QUITE. NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE AS JUST TAKING AND DELETING A SENTENCE -- BUT THIS SERVICE. THIS PROCESS IS -- HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE AND I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S AN EFFORT. TO TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH THREE MILLION UNITS SHORT IN THE STATE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS. IS ONE OF THE WAYS TO GET OF THE KIND OF DEVELOPMENT THAT DID SHE KEEP MENTIONING THE GOVERNOR. A PROPOSED -- HICKEY HI I WOULD SUSPECT THIS WASN'T QUITE THE APPROACH SHE HAD IN MIND BUT A SO WE'RE CLEAR -- THE CHEST THE DELETION HERE DELETION THERE AND IS AN ATTORNEY WE ALL KNOW WORDS MATTER SO. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ADDRESSING THIS I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE REFERRING TO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. ODD THAT WE CHOSE TO IT WOULD HAVE JUST COME TO OUR KNOWLEDGE HERE. AND THE REASON FRANKLY THAT WE TOOK THAT LITTLE BREAK WAS SO I COULD TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY WERE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED. AT FIVE MINUTES TO SIX SO -- THERE'S IT IS AS I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT WHAT IT IS YOU FRUSTRATED WHICH IS EXACTLY. THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS JUST PASSED OUT TO US IS THAT CORRECT. I WANT TO KNOW I WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL DEALING WITH THE SAME I THINK WE'RE ABSOLUTELY ALL DEALING ON THE ON THE SAME PAGE -- SORRY. EDITOR ROBERT I'M. A THEIR THE VERSION THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND MADAM CHAIR MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE I CAN'T SEE WHICH MORTGAGES. READ BECAUSE IT IN THE VERSION THAT WAS HANDED OUT THE TERM UNREASONABLY WAS DELETED SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT WE SHALL GIVE THAT TO YOU. NO PROBLEM -- I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO WORD OF BRING THAT UP FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES -- BUT YES I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE -- MADAM CHAIR -- DAN I THINK MAYBE NOT IF THAT NOW. I WOULD LIKE OKAY LET YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE ANOTHER FIVE MINUTE BREAK AND WE'RE GOING TO CUT TRY TO GET SOME YES THEY'RE FINE QUESTION CENTER MONNING. HANDOUT I RECEIVE SAYS AMENDED -- SENATE FOR TWENTY NINE NINETEEN THAT WAS YESTERDAY. IS THAT THE SAME [inaudible] ONE THE MARKET. ON THE BOTTOM LEFT THIS THIS ISN'T LEFT THIS ISN'T THE WAY WE SHOULD BE DOING BUSINESS HERE SO LET'S TAKE A FIVE MINUTE BREAK FIND OUT. WHAT EXACTLY IT IS THAT IS BEFORE US AT THIS MOMENT? AND WE WILL. RECONVENE. AS SOON AS WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO I AM GOING TO READ THIS SO THAT EVERYBODY THE WHO'S INTERESTED IN THIS WILL BE CLEAR. SECTION ONE SECTION TWENTY ONE ONE SEVENTY FIVE IS ADDED TO THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CO TO READ. SUBDIVISION A THE COURT MAY UPON MOTION OF A PARTY AWARD REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES IN AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING FILE PURSUANT TO THIS DIVISION IF THE COURT FINDS. THAT ALL OF THE FOLLOWING APPLY NUMBER ONE THE PARTY IS A PREVAILING PARTY IS DEFINED IN SECTION. TEN THIRTY TWO OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE NUMBER TWO THE PETITIONER USED ACTIONS TACTICS OR CLAIMS THAT WERE BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING. A MADE IN BAD FAITH BE FRIVOLOUS OR INTENDED TO CAUSE UNNECESSARY DELAY. SUBSECTION BE THIS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATED TO A PROJECT INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING. AT AN INFILL SITE SEE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SHALL ADOPT THE RULE OF COURT TO IMPLEMENT THIS SECTION [inaudible] SECRETARY [inaudible] VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AYE MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD TURN IT OVER -- TO ARE -- IS THE VISITORS. AND IF YOU WOULD PLEASE ADDRESS THE AMENDED VERSION ONLY. YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU. THREE D. MADAM CHAIR ADAM RIGHTLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HOBBIES. JUST TO CLARIFY THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS. THERE'S NO SENATE M. THERE'S NO AND REASONABLY SENATE RIGHT. IN THIS IN THIS VERSION NOW OKAY. THAT'S THE ONE WE'RE CONSIDERING OKAY [inaudible] START. THAT REDDING CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I WANNA BEGIN BY STATING THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TO THE SURPRISE OF SOME -- BELIEVE SEQUEL -- IS ACTUALLY A INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT STATUE TO PRESERVING CALIFORNIA'S -- ENVIRONMENT ENSURING PROJECTS DO SO SUSTAINABLY AND WITH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION SO THE ISSUED WITH SB SIX FIVE NINE IS NOT TO CHILL PUBLIC PARTICIPATION OR UNDERMINE ANYWAY THE SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS OF SEEK WELL. THE ISSUE THAT THE SENATOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHEN SEE CA IS NOT USED TO FURTHER PUBLIC INTEREST FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. WE WORRY ABOUT THE PERVERSION OF SEQUEL -- TO FURTHER A PRIVATE INTEREST WHOLLY UNRELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION -- FROM VARIOUS DISCRETIONARY PROJECTS THE SU AND SETTLED TACTICS OR THREATEN TO SUE IN SUBTLE TACTICS ARE INEXPENSIVE FOR PLAINTIFFS TO FILE THEY DELAY HOUSING PROJECTS AND ADD SIGNIFICANT COSTS. TO THESE PROJECTS EVEN WHEN A DEFENDANT ULTIMATELY IT WINS. THIS BILL ISN'T IS INTENDED TO DETER ANYONE FROM ATTENDING TO UTILIZE SEEK WAS VERY BROAD STANDING REQUIREMENTS TO FILE MERITLESS OR FRIVOLOUS SEQUEL LAWSUITS. IF THEY KNOW. THAT THEY COULD WIN AN ATTORNEY'S FEES FROM DEFENDANTS OVER ANY OF ITS OF THEIR CLAIMS. THE PERVERSION OF SEQUEL BEYOND ITS ORIGINAL TEN INTENT UNDERMINES ITS INTEGRITY AND AND ROADS PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. IN A LAW THAT HAS SERVED TO SUSTAINABLY DEVELOP CALIFORNIA FOR MORE THAN FIVE DECADES. AS STATED THE CHAMBER DOES SUPPORT SYKORA AND EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE STATUTES ORIGINAL INTENTION OF OF INSURING THAT PROJECTS MITIGATE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS TO LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT. WE BELIEVE EVEN ON THE AMENDED VERSION IT IS IT NARROWLY pINFILL HOUSING AGAINST FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. FRANKLY THIS IS AN OBJECTIVE THAT I THINK ALL SIDES SHOULD AGREE ON THAT DETERRING LAWSUITS WITH NO ENVIRONMENTAL MERIT. ONLY EXACERBATED THE STATE'S CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS. FOR THIS REASON WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANKS. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. EVEN CHEN MEMBERS COREY SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSING ACTION COALITION OUR TWENTY YEAR OLD NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES FOR HOUSING ON BEHALF. OF ALL LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY AND ONE MAKE IT CLEAR WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE ARE AGAINST THE ABUSE A SEQUEL LAWSUITS AND I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES THAT HAVE COME UP. A RECENTLY OF OF PEOPLE USING SEQUEL TO STOP HOUSING FROM BEING BUILT ON THE NAVIGATION CENTER CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED IN SAN FRANCISCO ALONG THE EMBARCADERO -- WHERE OPPONENTS OF THE TWO HUNDRED BED SHELTER I'VE ALREADY RAISED A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS -- TO PREVENT THE HOMELESS FACILITY FROM BEING BUILT ON FOR SOME SAN FRANCISCO'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS -- THERE'S A HABITAT FOR HUMANITY PROJECT ON JEFFERSON AVENUE IN REDWOOD CITY THAT WAS DELAYED SIXTEEN MONTHS -- BY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ACTUALLY A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY WHO HAS JUST PUBLICLYSTATED THAT HE JUST DOES NOT WANT THIS HOUSING TO GET BUILT I HE HAD FILED LAWSUITS PREVIOUSLY -- USING SICK WAS WELLTO DELAY AND TRY TO IMPEDE HOUSING OUT ONE SPECIFIC ASPECT ABOUT THIS THE PROJECT HAD ACTUALLY. ALREADY HAD ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND METICULOUSLY REVIEWED AND THAT THE I. R. WAS UNANIMOUSLY IMPROVED -- AND HABITAT IT WILL BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR THEIR REPUTATION. WOULD STOP THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER FROM MOVING FORWARD -- AND THEN RECENTLY THERE WAS A PROJECT ON RUSH STREET IN SAN FRANCISCO'S SOUTH OF MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD. SIXTY NEW HOMES RATE -- WERE TURNED DOWN BECAUSE OF A SHADOW ON A BASKETBALL COURT LATE IN THE EVENING -- DURING THE SUMMER AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME YOU DON'T WANNA SHOOT BASKETS -- INTO THE SUN IT MAKES IT PRETTY DIFFICULT SO -- THESE ARE JUST THREE RECENT EXAMPLES AND AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY MANY MORE ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE AMENDED VERSION OF THE BILL WHICH WE'VE JUST RECEIVED. OKAY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD EVENING TWO MINUTES TEACHERS THROUGH ANTI MANAGER MEMBERS AS ARE THE OTHER HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL STRONG OPPOSITION. WE BELIEVE SB SIX FIVE NINE IS UNNECESSARY RESTRICTS EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ND WOULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON ENFORCEMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE MUST BE CLEAR SIGNAL IS A KEY LAW FOR PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH BUT IT ALSO GIVES RESIDENTS OF VOICE IN LAND USE DECISIONS FOR IMPORTANT VOICE. THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CARE ABOUT AN ISSUE SUCH AS GENTRIFICATION DISPLACEMENT LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND AFFECTING ISSUES OF THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE BELIEVE THE STATE LAW ALREADY PROVIDES FOR SANCTIONS INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES ONE IF A PARTY ACTS IN BAD FAITH TO IN THE FOR REAL THIS WAY. FOR THREE SOLELY INTENDED TO CAUSE UNNECESSARY DELAY WANNA JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THE THEY ARE ANALYSIS WHICH IS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND VERY THOROUGH. WE BELIEVE THE REAL PURPOSE OF SB SIX FIVE NINE IS TO DISSUADE PARTIES FROM CHALLENGING GOVERNMENT'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROVISIONS OF SECA. IT IS WELL SETTLED THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES COMPLIANCE WITH SECA IMPLICATES IMPORTANT RIGHTS AFFECTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST. SB SIX FIVE NINE WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERMINED THE BASIC PURPOSE A SEQUEL BY IMPEDING OR DISSUADING PUBLICAN FORSMAN OF SEQUEL AND FOR THOSE REASONS RECHARGE YOUR STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES PLACE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWO MINUTES LET ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER TREES OF CALIFORNIA I I THINK THE QUESTION HERE IS NOT. THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL BUT THE FACT OF THE BILL -- I KNOW BECAUSE ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS DRAGGED INTO A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ISSUE I HAD NOTHING TO DO A SEQUEL BEFORE I THOUGHT EVERYONE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS WERE NIMBIS. I'D LEARNED A LOT DURING THAT THING AND THE WAY DEVELOPERS OFTEN ACT THE BAD DEVELOPERS NOT THE GOOD ONES IS IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP WHO HAS THE GUTS TO BRING A LAWSUIT. THEY WILL NOT TALK TO YOU IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY ARE VIOLATING SEQUEL. SINCE THAT TIME SO THIS WAS AN URBAN INFILL PROJECT IN SAN DIEGO WE WANTED URBAN INFILL WE WANTED MORE HOUSING UNITS AND WE WANTED RETAIL WE JUST WANTED IT DONE RIGHT. BECAUSE DEVELOPERS WANT TO DEVELOP COMMUNITIES WANT DEVELOPMENT THAT IS GOOD AND PROPER. SO WHAT I SO SINCE THAT TIME FOURTEEN YEARS AGO I HAVE WATCHED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE. THESE FOLKS TO FIGHT THESE BATTLES. I'M SURE THERE ARE NEWBIES. THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE SEEN DO THIS OVER THE YEARS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ARE COURAGEOUS CIVIC MINDED PEOPLE IF MORE CALIFORNIANS WERE IS DEDICATED TO SOME OF THE FOLKS. THAT ENGAGE IN THESE LAWSUITS. WE WOULD BE A FABULOUS FABULOUS STATE. SO THE EFFECT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE THESE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS THESE ARE JUST REGULAR PEOPLE. WHEN THEY ARE FACED WITH THE POSSIBILITY? OF BEING SANCTIONED OR HAVING TO PAY THE OTHER SIDE'S ATTORNEYS' FEES THESE ARE DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH BATTLES TO BEGIN WITH. IS THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL NOT BE BROUGHT THERE ARE FAR BETTER WAYS. TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES THESE ARE JUST READ ACTIONS. PASSED LEGISLATION TO SPEED ALONG THE REPAIR PROCESS THAT'LL TAKE CARE OF ANY PROBLEM WITH ANY BASIS LAWSUITS OR EVEN LAWSUITS THAT ARE BASIS BUT JUST NEED TO BE LITIGATED. BUT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE THE WRONG OF FACT IT IS THE WRONG MEASURE FOR THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D STEP FOR DAMON AFFILIATION PLEASE A BURNING DAWSON -- ON WITH SEE A CALIFORNIA IF I MAY JUST MAKE ONE POINT THAT THE THE INSISTED MAKE -- THE BILL DOES NOT DEFINE INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND INFILL DEVELOPMENT IS. HAS MULTIPLE DEFINITIONS WITH MANY OF WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARILY A POINT -- MANY OF WHICH ARE BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT ESSENTIALLY -- UNDER THIS BILLS I DO DEVELOPER COULD ESSENTIALLY MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S INFILL DEVELOPMENT BUT HE ONLY PROVIDES FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THANK YOU AND SO THAT POINT. WE WOULD HAVE TO OPPOSE BILL THANK YOU. MONSTER MARROW WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS STRONGLY OPPOSED. THANK YOU. ABC LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRONGLY OPPOSED THANK YOU. MATTHEW BAKER PLAYING CONSERVATION THE WE HAVEN'T TAKEN A FORMAL POSITION ON ON THE BILL BUT WE DO SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

OF FALL BY SENATOR Y. CASK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR HIS COMMITMENT AND I THINK A SHARED OBJECTIVE ON THIS DíAS. THE FIGURE OUT WAYS. TO INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INFILL IT'S A TRUCK. TO ME THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE THAT WERE GRAPPLING WITH IN IN THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE -- ARE YOU AWARE OF CURRENT. REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO A JUDGE FOR ENTERING SANCTIONS. ANA PARTY THAT ACCENT OF FRIVOLOUS MANNER. ONE TWENTY EIGHT SOUL PROCEDURE YES AND WHY IS THAT NOT SUFFICIENT. THERE'S THERE'S ALREADY HAS IN I'M SORRY BUT IN MY READ OF ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT [inaudible] FIVE THE JUDGE. MAY ORDER A PARTY OR THE PARTIES ATTORNEY OR BOTH TO PAY THE REASONABLE EXPENSES. INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES INCURRED BY ANOTHER PARTY AS A RESULT OF ACTIONS ARE TACTICS MADE IN BAD FAITH. THAT ARE FRIVOLOUS OR SOLELY INTENDED TO CAUSE UNNECESSARY DELAY -- THAT'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THAT UP -- IF I BEFORE I ANSWER THAT I WOULD LIKE -- TO EXTEND MY APPRECIATION TO ALL THE FOLKS THAT -- WERE PART OF MAKING THIS BETTER FIRST AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY -- TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE -- ON WERE REQUESTED -- AND THEN OF COURSE -- PRIOR -- TO OUR OUR HEARING TODAY MEETING WITH FOLKS THAT -- WANTED TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER AND I THINK REALLY I IT SHOWS THAT WE WANT TO BE CONSENSUS BUILDERS EVEN ON ISSUES -- THAT CAN BE CONTROVERSIAL THE IDEAS WE WANT TO MOVE THE NEEDLE FORTY WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS -- IMPORTANT -- STEP IN IN DEALING WITH THE SOME OF THE SECRET CHALLENGE WE HAVE. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ADDRESSING OUR HOUSING. TO GO DIRECTLY TO YOUR POINT -- AND I KNOW THAT MY MY MY COLLEAGUES HERE -- ARE ABLE TO COMMENT FURTHER BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS THAT DIFFERENTIATE -- CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE ONE TWENTY EIGHT FROM FROM THIS ONE I SEE WHAT. RELATED SANCTIONS SHOULD APPROPRIATELY BE IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. SO FAR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT OVER THERE -- THE SECOND IS A IMPRESSING UPON -- CALIFORNIA THE IMPORTANCE OF HOUSING IN HOW WE BELIEVE BY VIRTUE OF THIS -- THAT LEGISLATION THE POLITICAL MESSAGES THAT WE WANT. TO PRESERVE SEQUEL BUT WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE MERITORIOUS ACTIONS AND I THINK. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT -- AND SEQUEL HAS BEEN USED BY BY CERTAIN FOLKS -- FOR DIFFERENT REASONS ALSO IT EXTENDS ODD TO CLAIMS. AND IT ALSO -- ON HAS -- OTHER MODIFICATIONS. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S THAT WE BRING IT IN TO BRING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE INTO THE PUBLIC RESOURCES -- CODE AND WITH THAT I'D MAYBE I'LL PASS OVER. MADAM CHAIR THEIR PERMISSION VERY BRIEFLY. THE DISTINGUISHING FACTOR WITH ONE TWENTY POINT FIVE IS IT INCLUDES THE BOARD'S SOLE PURPOSE WHICH THE COURTS HAVE INTERPRETED AS A SUBJECTIVE STANDARD VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVE UNDERSEA WHEN YOU BRING -- NUMEROUS CLAIMS I THINK THE ISSUE ITS SOLE PURPOSE TO HARASS THIS BILL -- ADDRESSES REALLY JUST MERITLESS SEQUEL CLAIMS AND ACTIONS SO IT'S ALITTLE BIT BROADER IN THAT SENSE BUT NARAL ANOTHER SENSE THAT WE CAN SPEAK -- TO ALSO ONE TWENTY POINT FIVE IS NOT A UNIVERSAL SANCTIONS STATUTE THAT ALL DIFFERENT LAWS RELY UPON FOR EXAMPLE YOU THE FEE SHIFTING STATUTES UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE. ONE TWO NINE SIX FIVE AND ALSO UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT UNDER -- CCP SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THERE'S ALSO IF YOU SERVED IN STATUTE AND SO TO THE SENATOR'S POINT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HOW IS IT. IN THE LAWN WHICH WERE DEALING WITH BECAUSE IT'S A DETERRENT STATUTE AND SEE IF YOU'RE READING SEEK WHAT YOU WANT NO IT'S IN THE FALL OF RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY CAN QUEUE AND THROUGH THE CHAIR. PLEASE -- THE SEQUEL ACTION DOES NOT BAR A JUDGE FROM INVOKING. ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE WE LOOKED AT TWENTY YEARS OF CASE LAW WE HADN'T FIND AT A SINGLE CASE THAT -- IT WAS APPLIED AT BUT I DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HER ACT IT'S DOESN'T BAR IT. THANK YOU YEAH AND THROUGH THE CHAIR I MIGHT ASK. THE OPPONENT IF YOU WOULD. ADDRESS AND WHY. C. C. P. ONE TWENTY POINT FIVE OR JUST BEFORE I GO THERE. YOU KNOW BACK TO THE AUTHOR AGAIN. WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING? IS THAT THERE'S A POLITICAL PURPOSE TO THIS TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF INFILL HOUSING. BUT TO ME THAT'S IF IF WE ALREADY HAVE IN STATUTE. JUDICIAL DISCRETION THAT CAN IMPOSE THESE PENALTIES. THEN I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE USING CREATION. OF ANOTHER LONG TO UNDERSCORE A POLITICAL POINT IT ALREADY EXISTS BUT THROUGH THE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO GO TO THE OPPOSITION WITH THE SAME QUESTION WHY ISN'T I RESPOND. TO KNOW WHAT WE'VE GOT THAT I THAT WAS A STATEMENT NOT A WRIST NOT A QUESTION I DON'T BELIEVE. RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR IT IF I COULD HAVE THE OPPOSITION ANSWER THAT AND THEN. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THROUGH THE CHAIR ALL VERY GOOD ON BACK TO THEAUTHOR THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE APPLIED THERE WOULD BE NO REPORTED CASES BECAUSE IT IS AWARDED BY TRIAL COURTS IT WOULDN'T BE ANY PUBLISHED DECISIONS ON THAT. AND I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT DISCOVERY SANCTIONS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR FAILURE FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE RIPPER SEATING TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD. DISCOVERY SANCTIONS ARE REGULARLY -- IMPOSED BY TRIAL COURTS THEY'RE VERY EFFECTIVE AND THEY'RE VERY AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE COMMONLY USED. THANK YOU AND THEN THROUGH THE CHAIR I COULD ASK THE AUTHOR TO ANYONE TO FURTHER EXPOUND ON THAT WELL I THINK -- WHAT WE HEARD OF -- IS THAT -- DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A RECORD -- THAT -- ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE IS ACTIVELY USED -- I THINK. I THINK IT IS IT IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. THAT IF WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE INTELLECTUALLY HONEST IN THINKING. THAT I THAT THE DELAYS IN THE COST OVERRUNS THAT OCCUR WITH ODD THESE SAYS SEEK RELATED -- MATTERS. IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IF YOU REDUCE THE SEQUEL LAWSUITS AND THERE WAS AT HALL IN THE NIGHT -- STUDY IN MY JOB MIND YOU THAT WAS DURING THE RECESSION THAT WE HAD ABOUT -- SIX HUNDRED MATTERS THAT WERE -- THAT WERE A LITTLE PIECE OF LITIGATION THAT WERE FILED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THAT'S ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED PER YEAR THAT WAS DURING THE RECESSION SO I THINK AS TIME GOES ON WILL. IF ANYONE IS SERVED ANY TIME IN LOCAL POLITICS WHETHER BE THE CITY OR A COUNTY. WE SEE HOW IT'S USED THE PROBLEM IS I AGREE THAT SEQUEL IS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT. IN THIS IS ONE WAY OF MAKING CERTAIN THAT SEQUEL IS REMAINS INTACT. BUT THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING ARE ACTING IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY AND ON THE MERITS. SO FINAL QUESTION IN YOUR REVIEW OF ALL THOSE CASES. AS A PREVAILING PARTY EVER BEEN PREVENTED. FROM ASKING A JUDGE TO IMPOSE. CCP ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE SANCTIONS I THINK YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE YOUR QUESTION IS A FAIR ONE IN THE A MORE FAIR RESPONSE IS. IS BECAUSE IT MAY BE IN PRINT DOES IT MEAN THAT IT'S ACTUALLY UTILIZED ON IT. AND THAT'S ALL THAT OVER THE PHONE UNDER CURRENT LAW FROM A PREVAILING PARTY. TO SEEK ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE RELIEF WHEN? THERE IS NO PROHIBITION BUT IF I MAY X. NO I THINK THE THE QUESTION WAS A SIMPLE ONE LET'S BE FUN TIME THANK YOU MAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CENTER Y. CASKEY FALL BY SENATOR ALAN. I GUESS THERE'S A QUESTION OF IS THIS LITIGATION THAT WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT AS PRONOUNCED SAYS JENNIFER HERNANDEZ FROM HOME ON THE NIGHT HAS SUGGESTED. SUGGESTED ON PAGE EIGHT OF OUR ALICE'S FOOTNOTE FIVE TALKS ABOUT JENNIFER HERNANDEZ I LOVE JENNIFER WHEREVER YOU ARE BUT HE SAID IT IN FEEL SHE DEFINED IT IS ANY PROJECT. WITHIN THE STE THE CONFINES OF A CITY OR ANY PROJECT IN AN UNINCORPORATED AREA THAT WAS ADJACENT TO SOMETHING IS THAT SOMETHING BILL SO THAT WAS BY FAR THE MOST EXPANSIVE. DEFINITION THAT WE'VE EVER HAD OF INFILL IN FACT I BELIEVE. WE'VE BEEN USING A DEFINITION HERE AT LEAST FOR INFILL NOT WHAT. IS THAT IT'S HE USED UP OF PARCEL THE AS PREVIOUS ROOM USED FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE. SO SO THERE WAS A TWO YEAR STUDY BY THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY THE CAME OUT THAT SAID WE HAVE LITIGATION IN ABOUT 1% OF ALL THE GOVERNMENT PROJECTS HIS MANY OF THE PROJECTS TO REDWOOD CITY ARE THE LEAD AGENCY IS THE CITY WE CONTACTED ALL THE CITIES. AND THEY SAID 1% OF ALL THE C. QUIRK [inaudible] I CHECKS. TURN UP TO LITIGATION SO WE WORK WERE USING. HERNANDEZ'S EXPANSIVE VIEW OF WHAT IN PHYLLIS IN AND AND THEN THE THAT ARE SO THE SENATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITIES PHONE -- REPORT SALUTE THEN THERE WAS UC BERKELEY JUST CAME OUT WITH IN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER WITH THE REPORTED SAID. THE INCIDENCE OF LAWSUIT. WITH IN SEQUEL CHALLENGES BECAUSE YOU GOT NEGATIVE DECKS. YOU KNOW -- MITIGATED NEGATIVE TAKES FULL E. R. R.. IS 2% 2% THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY SUE SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. THE CALIFORNIA BAR MIL QUALITY ACT. ONLY ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO SUE THERE'S NO ENVIRONMENTAL SAR THAT CAN SAY YOU GOT IT RIGHT YOU GOT IT WRONG THE ONLY AFTER YOU THE COMP THE CONSUMER HAS IS TO SUE. THAT'S THE LAW THAT'S ALL WE MAY SIT HERE AND CRITICIZE IT BUT THAT'S THE ONLY OPTION THEY HAVE SO. WHY WOULD WE WANT? TO YOU'RE SO RIGHT WHY WOULD WE WANT -- TO SHE'LL THE AND ADD A LITIGANT'S OPPORTUNITY -- TO USE THE ONLY RECOURSE A HALF OF THE PROJECT THEY ABOUT OBJECT TO BUY SIX BY. I'D ACTUALLY ALLOWING -- FOR OR FRIGHTEN THEM TO SAY THAT THEY MAY BE HIT WITH ATTORNEY FEES IF THEY ARE USING THE LANGUAGE. CAUSING UNNECESSARY DELAY IN -- CASKEY THAT IS A FANTASTIC QUESTION AND I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH YOU. IF IT IF INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS OR COMMUNITIES WANT TO CHALLENGER PROJECT -- UNDER SEEK WERE [inaudible] THEY SHOULD. THEY JUST NEED TO BE ON THE MERITS. AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IN IT WITH WITH A LESS SELECTIVE READING IT IS BAD FAITH. AND I IN USING THIS TO INTENDED FOR DELAYS. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE A BIG SEPARATION HERE YOU AND I PHILOSOPHICALLY IS THAT -- I WANT TO SEE WHAT MATTERS TO GO TO LITIGATION PROCESS I JUST WANT THEM TO BE ON THE MERITS BECAUSE IF THEY'RE ON THE MERITS THERE ARE NO ATTORNEYS FEES. BUT IN LITIGATION. YOU KNOW PEOPLE THROW THE KITCHEN SINK IN AND THEIR PLEADINGS AND THEY PLEAD EVERYTHING IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION AND WHAT WHAT IT APPEARS THAT THIS. THIS LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE IS THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE CAUSES OF ACTIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRYING DAD YOU MAY BE SECOND GUESSED BY. THE DEVELOPER WHO WANTS TO BUILD THE PROJECT THAT YOU'RE SIMPLY DELAYING IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE FORTY SEVEN CAUSES OF ACTION YOU HAVE. THREE EN EN THAT'S NOT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER AREA OF THE LAW THAT I KNOW OF I'M A COMPLAINT. SO. I DIDN'T HAVE SUPPORT THIS IN EQ. LIKE A SUPPORTER TODAY. QUESTION I'LL THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO START THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN. WELL I MEAN JENNIFER HERNANDEZ CAN DEFINE INFO ALL SHE WANTS BUT THE COURTS ARE NOT GONNA GIVE. ONE OUT OF THE DAM BECAUSE IT'S DEFINED IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE AND ALSO IN SECRET GUIDELINES SO -- THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT IS THE TERM WAS USED. TO THE FINANCIAL AND AND THAT'S WHAT THE YOU KNOW THE FOOTNOTE GOES ON TO TO DESCRIBE THOSE. TWO PORTIONS OF BOTH REGULATION AND AND STATUTE THAT -- DEFINED INFILL -- I GUESS SO THIS IS AN INTERESTING THING TO WATCH BECAUSE THAT I I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THESE. EVERYYOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE BASICALLY IS IS TURN INTO LITIGATION OVER THE MERITS OF C. QUIET SEQUEL LAWSUITS IN GENERAL TO THAT WE HAVE THESE TWO ENORMOUS ARMIES THAT ARE HERE. AND AND AND YOU KNOW MAKING THEIR CASE -- BUT THEY'RE REALLY FIGHTING OVER CENTIMETER -- YOU KNOW THE END OF THE DAY HEY THIS BILL -- SO WHEN WHEN THIS BILL CAME TO YOU Q.. FIVE YOU KNOW THE SENATOR WANTED. TO TEST OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND A POSSIBILITY OF OF AN AND REASONABLE AS STANDARD. AND I THINK WE WERE WILLING -- TO LET THAT BE TESTED OUT HERE IN JUDICIARY BECAUSE WE KNOW THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DOES A GREAT JOB PROVIDING. DETAILED ANALYSIS TO LOOK AT THE RAMIFICATIONS IMPLICATIONS OF THE USE OF THAT TERM -- IN A IN AND ONCE AGAIN OF COURSE OUR OUR% GREAT STAFF HERE PRODUCED A SIXTEEN PAGE ANALYSIS THAT I READ CAREFULLY. AND I THINK YOU KNOW PARTLY AS A RESULT -- YOU ARE ASKED TO DROP THE AND REASONABLE IS STANDARD -- FROM YOUR BILL. AND SO NOW THE BILL AND AN END VERY VERY SIGNIFICANTLY. YOU ASKED TO DROP THE SECOND SENTENCE OF YOUR BILL AS IT AS IT ORIGINALLY WAS LAID OUT. BECAUSE IT DID CREATE AN IMBALANCE OF STANDARDS BETWEEN THE PETITIONER AND THE DEVELOPER OR THE THE YEAH THE THE AGENCY THE LEAD AGENCY. AND THEY ACTUALLY TOOK DISCRETION AWAY FROM A JUDGE. OUR BY CREATING THIS KIND OF CONVOLUTED PERCENTAGE SYSTEM BASED ON THE CLAIMS I MEAN I ALSO DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF OF OF AND EXPLAINING WHY THAT WAS A PROBLEM -- IT TALKS ABOUT THAT IN SECTION SIX WHICH IS ON PAGES TWELVE AND THIRTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND AND YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE ONLY REASON TO SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TO GIVE. A LITTLE BIT MORE DISCRETION TO A JUDGE -- YOU KNOW WHO'S ACTUALLY GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AND EXAMINE THE ISSUES AT HAND AND THAT SECTION THAT YOU HAD IN YOUR BILL RELATING -- TO THE THE CLAIMS AND AND PERCENTAGES TOOK AWAY DISCRETION SO -- I I I THINK THAT -- IN THE END OF THE DAY. WE ARE NOW WITH LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES. A JUDGE TO HAVE A FINDING THAT THE PETITIONER ACTED IN BAD FAITH. SO IT -- IT FOR YOU FOR FOR THERE TO BE ANY AWARD ANY POSSIBILITY OF A WARNING. OF ATTORNEYS FEES NOW A BAD FAITH FINDING IS A VERY HIGH BAR AND IT'S OR LOOK. THE CORE CONCERNS THAT WORD YOU KNOW THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IN THE ANALYSIS -- WORD OF YOUR USE OF AND REASONABLE AS HE WAS A CONSUMER ATTORNEY'S IN THEIR LETTER THAT THAT THAT THAT SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT THE AND REASONABLE THIS ISSUE -- AND AND AND AND AND THE CONSUMER TRAINEES SAY STATE AND REASONABLE THIS IS A FAR LOWER STANDARD THAN BAD FAITH. AND IT'S EASY BE ONE TWENTY POINT FIVE WAS ENACTED SPECIFICALLY FOR BAD FAITH ACTIONS ARE TACTICS IN ORDER TO RETAIN THE HIGH PROOF REQUIRED FOR SUCH AWARDS. THEREFORE IT APPLIES TO THE TRULY EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR SO AS NOT TO DETER LEGITIMATE ACTIONS AND AND REASONABLENESS STANDARD DOES NOT SHARE THE SAME HIGH BAR SO. RIGHT THERE IN THE CONSUMER JOURNEYS LETTER IT KIND OF EXTOLS THE VIRTUE OF THE BAD FAITH STANDARD THAT BADLY STANDARD IS EXAMINED AND STUDIED IN THE OPTICAL SURPLUS CASE IT'S DESCRIBED. HERE -- AND AND IT'S ALSO DESCRIBED A BIT ON PAGE SIX AS WELL SIX AND SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS SO -- YOU THAT BAD FAITH STANDARD IS A IS A WELL LITIGATED AND WELL -- EXAMINED. CANON OF LAW. AND IN THE END OF THE DAY. YOUR BACK TO ABOUT A STANDARD IN YOUR BILL I I ACTUALLY SAID HEY YOU KNOW. YOU REALLY EVEN WANT TO MOVE THIS BILL GIVEN HOW CLOSE IT. IS TO THE CURRENT STAND WITH ONE TWENTY POINT -- FIVE YOU KNOW YOU YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU WANTED -- TO BUT I I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL AS THOUGH WE'VE GOT AND EVERYONE KIND OF GIVING US THEIR STRONGLY HELD OPINIONS ABOUT CIVIL LITIGATION AND THEY'RE ALL YOU KNOW THIS IS THE BATTLE THAT WE CONTINUALLY HAVE. TO ADJUDICATE HERE -- BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BILL THAT MAINTAINS THAT MEETING THE BAD FAITH SET FINDING FOR THE AWARDING OF ATTORNEYS FEES BY JUDD SO. YOU KNOW I EIGHT EIGHT LET LET'S BE REAL HERE ABOUT WHAT THIS BUT THIS BILL WOULD YOU NEED TO BE REAL ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT DOESN'T DO AND YOU NEED TO BE REAL ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT DOESN'T DO I MEAN YOU'RE HERE YU SAID YOU'RE. TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. DO YOU KNOW OF YOUR YORK'S CONSENSUS YOUR YOUR CITING YOU KNOW HERNANDEZ AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND AND IN THE END OF THE DAY. HER HER LONG ATTACKS ON SEQUEL ARE ARE PRETTY IRRELEVANT TO WEAR THIS BILL HAS GOTTEN AND SO I'M I LOVE TO HEAR IF ANYONE HAS ANY. COGENT RESPONSE I I BUT I I I JUST I I'M I'M HAVING TROUBLE AND I BY THE WAY ICE I I WILL SAY. I TOTALLY RECOGNIZING THIS CHAIR WAS A VERY UNHAPPY OBVIOUSLY -- THAT THIS WAS JUST PRESENTED EVERYONE VERY RECENTLY -- YOU KNOW AND SO. DIE I'M SURE THAT'S THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S IN FORMING -- EVERYONE CAME IN WITH PREPARED STATEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUS BILL AND YOU KNOW WE ALL SCRAMBLING TO CRY. TO RECALIBRATE A GIVEN WHERE WE ARE AT BUT VOIGTS I WANTED. TO THANK YOU MEGA CENTER ALLEN. BEFORE YOU ANSWER IS IS YOUR QUESTION. WHAT WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW I MEAN WHAT WHAT AM I MISSING HERE THIS DOWNWARD CALLING FOR A BAD FAITH FINDING BY A JUDGE FOR THERE TO BE? OF THE THE FOR THE JUDGE TO HAVE THE OPTION. OF PROVIDING FOR FOR FOR ATTORNEYS FEES SO SO IT'S JUST. WHAT WHAT'S THE QUESTION I'M HAPPY TO HAVE SENATOR -- BOARD JUST RESPOND BUT A MENACING IS WITH IS MY QUESTION. OKAY WHAT ALL RIGHT HERE YOU'RE ALWAYS DRAWING THIS THING IN. WELL -- I THINK WHEN WE WHEN WE WHEN WE OPENED UP -- WE TALK ABOUT -- THE APPROPRIATENESS OF HAVING THIS PROVISION IN -- THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE THAT IT DOES HAVE MATERIAL -- DIFFERENCES IS A PUBLIC RESEARCH I GET THAT OLD BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES -- SOLELY CLAIMS THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES. BUT I THINK -- IT IS IT IS IT IS IMPORTANT. THAT WE ALSO SET -- A STRONG MESSAGE THAT -- BECAUSE THIS IS THAT WE ARE EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF HOUSING GIVEN ARE GIVEN OUR OUR STATE DIFFERENT SYMBOLISM THERE I THINK I DID I FAIRS. AND YES YOU HAVE. THE COUPLE COMMENTS IT WILL. I WAS GOING TO ADD THE FACT THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE SOLELY IN IT COURTS INTERPRET ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE WITH THE WORD SOLELY TO FIND A SUBJECTIVE BAD FAITH. WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO FIND SUBJECT ABOUT FATE WERE SAYING FRIVOLOUS AND MERITLESS SEQUEL CLAIMS WOULD FALL UNDER. SIX FIVE NINE ONE TWENTY EIGHT HAS SOLELY IN IT WHICH HAS A HIGHER STANDARD THAT'S RIGHT SO IT LOWERS THE STANDARD. ON WHICH THE STANDBY LOAN MAINTAINING FIGHT BAD FAITH IN THAT AND FINALLY IT WAS THAT. IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD CONSENSUS I CERTAINLY TAKING IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM -- MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LAST COMMITTEE -- I THINK I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO PUT FORWARD -- A PRODUCT THAT -- IS ABLE -- TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS AND I THINK. CERTAIN THINGS WERE TAKEN OUT -- NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BUT I IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS FORWARD IN MY LAST POINT IS THIS IS THAT. I AM PLEDGING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH -- WITH FOLKS I EVEN -- YOU KNOW MY FRIEND MR DHEAS -- FROM BUILDING TRADES AND OTHERS -- IN THOSE ON THE THIS COMMITTEE IN THOSE SUBSEQUENT TO THIS. WAYS TO IMPROVE THIS -- AS IT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE THE FOLKS ALL ALONG THE WAY TO TRY TO MAKE THIS A BETTER PRODUCT. IF YOU YES IF YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF THINGS THE FIRST FULL OF ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE DOESN'T WORK THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE IT WOULD. INEQUIVALENT WOULD WORK IN THIS CONTEXT SECOND OF ALL IF WE'RE DEALING WITH A SEQUEL ACTIONS BETWEEN SOPHISTICATED LITIGANTS. THESE FINER POINTS ABOUT BAD FAITH OR NOT BAD FAITH THEY'RE NOT GONNA MATTER THEIR SOPHISTICATED LITIGANTS. WHAT THE IMPACT REALLY IS IS ON THE ON THE FOLKS THAT GO AROUND THE SAKE WOULD YOU PLEASE CONTRIBUTE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WE CAN? HIGHER SOMEWHERE TO GO AND AND LOOK INTO WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A SEQUEL CASE YOU TELL THESE FOLKS WHO DO REALLY GOOD WORK. THAT THEY MAY ALSO GET HIT WITH THE OTHER SIDE'S ATTORNEYS' FEES IF THEY LOSE. FORGET ABOUT IT THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO GET THESE KINDS OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT LAWSUIT OFF THE GROUND TO BEGIN WITH. AND SO THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL AND REALLY IT'S NOT GONNA FACT THE PROBLEM I THINK WE ALL AGREE. EXIST WE WANT MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I'M LIKE I DON'T A PLAYER THE POINT WITH THAT BUT THE THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED SIMON V. BMUS BROTHERS WHICH WHICH YOU KNOW BASICALLY MAKES THAT POSSIBILITY SO UNLIKELY I MEAN THE OF A JUDGE OF OF A JUDGE SMACKING DOWN A A GOOD FAITH. LET AGAIN I YOU KNOW BUT BUT THE POINT WHEN WHEN A WHEN A NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP IS FACED WITH THE QUESTION OF DO WE FILE A CASE OR NOT. RIGHT AND SOMEBODY EIGHT AND THE DEVELOPERS ALREADY SAID AND IF YOU WILL AFTER US WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHERE TO GET ATTORNEY'S FEES AGAINST YOU. THAT HAS A TREMENDOUS A CHILLING EFFECT ON REGULAR PEOPLE THAT'S MY POINT I I JUST I THINK THAT IS. AN EXAGGERATION WITH RESPECT GIVEN GIVEN THE SIMON CASE BUT THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE LEGISLATURE FINALLY GET TO FIGHT OVER KIND OF MINUSCULE -- MINUSCULE CAM INCHES OF OF OF THESE MEN ARMS BATTLES. I'D OF SO I THINK -- I THINK THE THE THE THE POINT IS THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A CHILLING EFFECT. WE HAVE A LAW ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT -- FIVE A J. JUDGES ARE NOT GOING TO BE -- TRICKED BY SOMETHING NOT BEING IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE -- IT WOULD WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BY VIRTUE OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT DOES. LOWER THE STANDARD. AND TWO IF YOU WANT TO LOWER THE STANDARD THEN YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR THIS -- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOWER THE STANDARD -- YOU SHOULDN'T AND I I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT. I THINK WHAT WE THERE ARE TWO THINGS I WANT TO SAY ONE IS THAT HALL AND NIGHT REPORT HAS BEEN THE BOND. IT WAS DONE BY AN ATTORNEY WHO FOR THE TWENTY YEARS I'VE KNOWN HER HAS BEEN AN ANTI SINGLE PERSON. SO THERE'S NO OBJECTIVITY THERE WE DID HAVE A HEARING. WHERE WE BROUGHT IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY WHICH HAS COMPLETED A SURVEY? WITHOUT ANY OF A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE RESULTS THEY PRODUCE THE A SURVEY THAT I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE CHALLENGED IT'S IT'S A METHODOLOGY WAS -- ACADEMIC AND WAS OBJECTIVE AND WE HAD THE BEST OF THE JUDGES COME IN WHO TRAINS SECRET JUDGES SAID SECORD. LITIGATION IS IS MINIMAL AT BEST WE WE WE DON'T GENERALLY SEE IT -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXPEDITING SECRET PROCEEDINGS WE'VE DONE THAT WE HAVE? DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS AND IN SOME INSTANCES NOW WE'VE GOT ADDED THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY REQUIREMENT WHICH I THINK IS IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE COURTS. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT IS APPROPRIATE TO DEAL WITH OUR HOUSING ISSUE TO THE EXTENT THAT. SHE QUIT IS A PROBLEM OR IS THE SOLUTION WE ALL WE NEED TO BUILD THREE MILLION UNITS IN THE STATE AND THAT ISN'T A SEQUEL PROBLEM. SO I THINK -- WE HAVE HERE -- AN ISSUE THAT -- I THINK THERE'S A POLITICAL A TONE TO THIS WE HAVE IF THERE ARE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS WE'VE GOT A LAW THAT PROTECTS. A ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IT IS DETERMINED THAT THERE. ARE HAS BEEN BAD FAITH R. N. AS WAS POINTED OUT. LITIGATION IS THE ONLY RECOURSE FOR C. C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; WE DON'T HAVE A D.&lt;/c&gt;</u> FE H. WE DON'T HAVE A YEAH. ANY KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY THE ONLY WAY TO ADDRESS A SEQUEL ISSUE IS THROUGH LITIGATION SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU BE HERE WE GO WE WANT TO SUE WE WANT TO DELAY THINGS. IT'S THE ONLY AVENUE THAT'S BEEN MADE AVAILABLE SO -- WHAT AND I APPRECIATE I WANT? TO THANK HIM THE SENATOR UMBERG FOR REALLY TRYING. TO HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK HERE BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PUT LIPSTICK ON THIS PIC AND I AM I CERTAINLY INVITE YOU TO CLOSE ON THIS UT I THINK IT REALLY IS DESIGNED TO HAVE THE CHILLING EFFECT -- I'M SORRY YOU GOT TO DO MORE THAT YOU GET A RAISE FOR HIM THERE YOU GO SENATOR JONES. I APOLOGIZE CENTER JONES AND THEN CENTER COVER YEAR JEWISH TOOK VERY GOOD ACTUALLY IF I MAY ASK HIM -- PROCEDURAL QUESTION FIRST HOW DO YOU WANT US. TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED HIS I THOUGHT I WAS IN THE RECOGNIZE BEFORE AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T SEE YOUR HAND UP YOU HAVE. TO OKAY AT LEAST GET MY ATTENTION I DIDN'T SEE VERY GOOD AND ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN MOSTLY ANSWER I HAD THE SAME CONCERN AS THE SIERRA CLUB AND AND CENTER ACCOUNTS YOU BROUGHT UP IN. I THINK CENTER ALLEN ANSWERED THE QUESTION BY JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE AUTHORS AGREEMENT WAS CENTER ALLEN. ON THE DEFINITION OF INFILL THAT IS DEFINED IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE AND I AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE AGREEING WITH. WITH HIS EXPLANATION THANK YOU. AND I MIGHT INDICATE THE THROUGH MY EXCELLENT COUNSEL HERE THAT IT'S NOT INFILL IS TO FIND IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SECTIONS SO THERE'S NO SPECIFIC DEFINITION. TO WHICH OF THAT PHRASE SUPPLIES SO -- THAT. WOULD IT HELP THOSE CENTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WOULD HELP IF THE AUTHOR. TOOK THAT AS AN AMENDMENT TO SPECIFY WHICH DEFINITION OF INFILL HE'S REFERRING. TO SEE QUIRK GUIDELINES. OKAY -- LET LET'S. TRY IT ON THE RECORD. I HAVE A DEFINING THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION TWENTY ONE ZERO SIX ONE POINT THREE THAT. I MEAN I I THINK WE CAN GET THE TO GET A COPY OF THAT -- WHAT WHILE OTHERS MAY BE LOOKING AT IT -- THE CENTER CUBBY YEAR OFF. MADAM CHAIR I JUST -- I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF WAIT INTO THIS AND DO IT VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE I JUST DON'T I I DISAGREE WITH YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF THE HEARING THAT WE HELD AND THE DATA THAT WAS PRESENTED -- AS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT LOOKING AT THIS AREA AND I THINK I THINK WHAT YOU SEE IN THE COMMITTEE. IS THAT WE'RE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE IMPACT THAT THAT IF WE ALL AGREE THAT SEEK WHAT DOES READ SOME REALLY IMPORTANT GOOD THINGS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT THE PROCESS. FOR GETTING PUBLIC INPUT AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROJECTS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THE MITIGATION IT'S THAT SHOULD BE -- APPROPRIATE FOR THE PROJECT ALL OF THAT IS IS REALLY GOOD STUFF BUT THERE HAVE BEEN ABUSES OF THE SEA QUEST SYSTEM IN THE LITIGATION AND THE PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS PRESENTED AT THE HEARING. WAS IT QUITE FRANKLY THE THE THE STUDY WAS DONE YET THEY DID NOT INCLUDE ANY RURAL COMMUNITIES DID NOT INCLUDE -- COASTAL COMMUNITIES -- AND AND WAS REALLY REALLY VERY LIMITED AND SO IT THE CHECK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT SEEK WHAT. IS IT WE ALL COME WITH THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE ABOUT HOW HOUSE SPEAKER HAS BEEN USED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN. A SEE A PROJECT IN THE SALINAS VALLEY THAT HASN'T BEEN CHALLENGE FOR FARM WORKER HOUSING AND SO AND AND IT PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS THE THREAT OF SEQUEL LITIGATION. AND THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT IT HAS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE A LITIGATION -- PROCESS SO I I JUST WANT TO GET THAT I THINK PART OF WHY YOU SEE SOME LANGUAGE BEING WORKED ON IS BECAUSE IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO FEEL -- THAT THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO GIVE THE JUDGE THE DISCRETION AND TO BE EXPLICIT ABOUT. THE DISCRETION TO BE ABLE TO SAY IF THIS IS A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEN THERE'S THE ABILITY TO GIVE TO GIVE -- ATTORNEY'S FEES IN IN THE IN THE IN THE ANSWERS SO I I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I JUST THINK THAT. THAT YOU DISCOUNT. SO MUCH THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD BAD EXPERIENCES THAT IT IT TO ME IT JUST SEEMS DISRESPECTFUL IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING YOU YOU KNOW. IS NOT TRUE AND SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON AND DO SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S NOT MY INTENT TOWARD MY SUGGESTION IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A CODE SECTION. THAT IS AVAILABLE IN THOSE CASES AND I CERTAINLY KNOW OF CASES WHERE I HAVE QUESTIONED THE MOTIVATION OF PEOPLE BRINGING OF OF THE SECT THESE KINDS OF LAWSUITS. THE COURTS ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT WE GOING TO KEEP. WE'RE GONNA KEEP PUNCHING THEM ABOUT IT OR WE GONNA SAY YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNDER ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE TO GRANT SANCTIONS IT'S THEIR NO ONE'S TRYING TO TAKE THAT AWAY. AND OBVIOUSLY WE YOU KNOW WE WE CAN SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT MY MY POINT IS THAT WE HAVE A MECHANISM TO ADDRESS THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS. AND I HAVE WORKED ON THE SEQUEL ISSUE. OF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS BECAUSE I SURE CONCERNS IN THE BILL THE DELAYS THAT HAVE EXISTED. SO NO ONE SAYING SEEK WAS PERFECT. BUT THE QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE A PROCESS ARE WE HAVE WE BEEN ABLE. TO EXPEDITED -- WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS RECENTLY THAT THAT REQUIRE COURTS WHEN THE CASE IS TO GO TO COURT TO BE FAST TRACKED TO THE DETRIMENT OF OTHER ISSUES PUBLIC POLICY. DECISIONS WHICH I HAVEN'T NECESSARILY AGREED WITH -- AND CLEARLY WE DO WE NEED TO TAKE A GOOD HARD COLD LOOK AT HOW WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE AND MY SUGGESTION IS. THAT SEEK WHAT. HAS THE REMEDIES WITHIN IT BY WAY OF ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE TO DO WITH THE ISSUES THAT THIS AUTHOR HAS PRESENTED HERE TODAY. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO DISAGREE -- AND WITH THAT -- US SENATOR UMBERG WE'RE GONNA LET YOU HAVE THE LAST WORD AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO LET THE SENATOR BORCHERS LOSE WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- JUST TO EXPAND UPON APPOINTED CENTER I'LL MAKE I ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE RAISING THE BAR HERE BECAUSE NOT JUST BAD FATE THE COURT. SHE WILL NEED TO FIND THAT THE PARTY ACTED IN BAD FAITH IN. IT WAS FRIVOLOUS OR INTENDED TO CAUSE UNNECESSARY DELAY AND SO IT IT RATHER RATHER THAN LOWERING THE BAR I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY REYES IT'S A TOUGH STANDARD A VERY TOUGH STANDARD TO MEET IN TERMS OF ANY CHILLING EFFECT NO ONE HERE WOULD ARGUE. NOT AS OPPONENTS READY WHAT ELSE THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FILE LIVER FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT. NO ONE'S GOING TO ARGUE THAT AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT. THIS ACTUALLY RAISES THE BAR IT IT. SORT OF ENCAPSULATES IT SUCH THAT THE COURT. KNOWS ABOUT IT. AND A CORD. IN THE APPROPRIATE CASE WHERE IT IS CLEARLY FOR FRIVOLOUS OR IN BAD FAITH CAN INVOKE THAT THAT SANCTION. THANK YOU MANAGER. A GOOD SENATOR STERN IS BURSTING AT THE SEAMS. THAT'S OUR HELP MYSELF I JUST FIGURED EVERYONE'S DIVING. I JUST. WE'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON TO ME WHAT IS THE HERE TODAY. END IT WITH A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO BE WORKING ON AND I APPRECIATE YOU ALL WANT TO MAKE A POINT. BUT BAD FACING THE LAW RIGHT NOW. FRIVOLITY OF CLAIMS IN THE LAW RIGHT NOW I DO NOT KNOW WHY WE'RE SPENDING TIME ON THIS ISSUE JUST SO WE CAN HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER SEQUEL WORKS OR DOESN'T WORK I DON'T THINK IT'S DISRESPECTFUL. NECESSARILY TO THE AYE AYE YOU DON'T WELL I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE CLAY ANYONE'S CLAIMS ARE CHALLENGES OR ISSUES. BUT THIS IS SITTING IN THE LAW RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS POLITICAL THEATER HERE TODAY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU STAND ON FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION IT SITTING THERE IN THE CO TWO DAYS SO I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY WE'RE VOTE ON THIS BILL ANYMORE BUT THERE. THANK YOU CLEARLY YOU'RE GETTING CRANKY YOUR BLOOD SUGAR IS LOW AND UNIQUE DINNER. ALL RIGHT SO VERY GOOD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU NO THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU IN I WANT TO THANK. THE CHAIR FOR HER INDULGENCE AND EVERYBODY FOR MAKING THEIR BEST EFFORT HERE AGAIN I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR. FOR THE BROAD OBJECTIVE THAT I KNOW HE SEEKS IN THAT AGAIN I THINK IS A SHARED OBJECTIVE. I DO FEEL COMPELLED THOUGH JUST. TO RESPOND A LITTLE BIT IN LOOKING AT THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE IN THE AMENDMENT -- IN THE SUGGESTION THAT IT IN FACT RAISES THE BAR. IT MAY RAISE THE BAR FOR JUDICIAL DETERMINATION AFTER SUIT HAS BEEN FILED. BUT WHAT'S THE METRIC CITIZEN ACTION THAT MAY NOT BE PURSUED BECAUSE OF THE CHILLING EFFECT OF BEING TOLD IF YOU FILED THIS LAWSUIT YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY THE ATTORNEYS FEES IF WE DON'T PREVAIL. TO ME THAT. THE GREATER THREAT OF REDEFINING. WHAT IS ALREADY AN ESTABLISHED JUDICIAL AUTHORITY TO FIND BAD FAITH? IN THE PURSUIT OF LITIGATION AND AGAIN I JUST THOSE THE REASONS THAT I WON'T BE SUPPORTING TODAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING A LOT OF HOUSING WITH YOU. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SOME OF THE BILL ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR JONES -- LET'S GO AHEAD AND OF YES AS AMENDED. A MOTION AS AMENDED AND ARTICULATED HERE CENTER BORCHERS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU AND I THINK -- IT'S LATE AND I KNOW THAT FOLKS -- I'VE HAD A LONG DAY -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH TO JUST KIND OF REITERATE THAT I AM WILLING TO WORK WITH FOLKS TO IMPROVE THIS AS I HAVE -- BOTH THAT DAY EQ I AND AND ALONG THIS PROCESS. I BELIEVE IT WILL CONTINUE TO GET BETTER -- AND I DO BELIEVE IT HAS MERIT THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES. ARE BETWEEN AT ONE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE DO NOT BE SEDUCED INTO THINKING THAT EVERYTHING IS CO PATHETIC. BECAUSE IT'S NOT. WE WOULD BE LIVING WITH A LIVING WITH BLINDERS IF WE THINK THAT THE HOUSING SITUATION IS OKAY. BETSY QUOTE PROCESS SEES ARE OKAY. THAT'S NOT THE REALITY WE LIVE IN. SO UNLESS WE'RE WILLING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THESE THINGS -- I DON'T THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE AND I THINK THIS IS A SMALL PART. OF ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS THAT IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OUR LOT. AND WITH THAT -- I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST -- YOUR AYE VOTE AND ALLOW THIS TO GO THROUGH A VETTING -- WITH AT THE NEXT AVAILABLE STAGE. THANK YOU SENATOR BORCHERS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FLOOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON NOPE. JACKSON NO BORDERS. HI WE'RE JUST AYE. ALAN. ALLEN HI CABALLERO.

BOB MR BY SURE MA'AM MEMBERS EVERY TIME WE GO TO THE STORE WE SHOP ONLINE CALIFORNIA WOMEN PAY MORE THAN MEN FOR WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PRODUCT. IT'S A FEW CENTS HERE A FEW DOLLARS THERE IN OVERTIME IT ADDS UP. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN THIS WAY EACH WOMAN PAYS AN AVERAGE. OF OVER THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH YEAR FOR CONSUMER GOODS AT THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS DO NOT. IN ESSENCE THIS AMOUNTS TO A TAX FOR BEING FEMALE. COMBINED WITH THE GENDER WAGE GAP THE GENDER TAX SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINES THE ABILITY OF WOMEN. TO SURVIVE AND TO THRIVE FINANCIALLY ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH MEN. WITH TAKING STRIDES TOWARDS CLOSING THE GENDER GAP ONCE AND FOR ALL. IT IS TIME WE DO THE SAME THING WITH THE GENDER TAX. THIS BILL WOULD REPEAL THE GENDER TAX IN CALIFORNIA IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE LET ME BE CLEAR THANKS TO THE WORK OF CONGRESS WOMAN JACKIE SPEAR WHEN SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE -- CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A GENDER TAX REPEAL LAW THAT APPLIES TO SERVICES. BACK WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS I FOLLOWED UP ON THAT LAW TO BE SURE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO POST THE DIFFERENCES IN PRICING. BASED UPON THINGS LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO THE CLEANER. AND DO YOU HAVE TWO SHIRTS. ALL THE BOTH THE SAME ONE IS A AMEND SURE MUCH LARGER BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME I TOOK MY HUSBAND SHIRT IN BIG GUY. MY SHIRT LITTLE PERSON. SAME SHIRT. MIKE -- COSTS FOR ME WAS FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A COST FOR HIM WAS A DOLLAR AND A QUARTER. AND THIS KIND OF THING CONTINUED WHETHER IT WAS HAIRDRESSERS GOING TO GET A PAIR OF PANTS SHORTENED -- YOU KNOW FIGURE SHORTENING A PAIR OF PANTS. FOR WOMEN AND COST MORE EVEN THOUGH THERE'S LESS MATERIAL TO GO BUY A PAIR OF JEANS IT. WAS AT LEAST TEN DOLLARS MORE FOR WOMEN SHEEN SWITCHER LESS FABRIC. SAME STYLE. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN OF CONCERN -- TO ME FOR QUITE SOME TIME. BUT WE NOW HAVE A LAW THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T. CHARGE MORE FOR SERVICES. BUT IT'S LESS CLEAR THE PRICE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER IS OUTLAWED WHEN IT COMES TO CONSUMER GOODS. AND THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL COMES IN. SO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES TAKEN FROM A TWENTY FIFTEEN NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS STUDY. ON THE ISSUE MAN THIS BLACK FUTURO REVITALIZING DRESS SOCKS SOLD ONLINE BY WALGREENS FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS. WOMENS BLACK FUNERAL REVITALIZING TROUSER SOCKS SOLD ONLINE BY WALGREENS. FOR TWENTY ONE NINETY NINE I SUBMIT PROBABLY LESS MATERIAL THREE TOP THREE DOLLARS MORE. CONSIDER BLUE DELTA CHILDREN LITTLE FUN WALKER SOLD ONLINE BY WALMART. BLUE FOR THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS VERY SAME ITEM IN PINK SOUL FOR FORTY FOUR DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS. ELEVEN DOLLARS MORE IT'S PINK EXACTLY THE SAME ITEM IT'S JUST PIC. MEN'S PINK A CLASSIC ONE PARK A DRESS SHIRT. PINK SOLD ONLINE FOR A BI LEVI'S FOR FORTY EIGHT DOLLARS WOMEN'S PINK A ONE POCKET BOYFRIEND SHIRT IN OTHER WORDS SAME STYLE SHIRT. SOLD ONLINE BY LEVI'S FOR SEVENTY EIGHT DOLLARS. THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. THESE ARE JUST A FEW MAYOR OF MYRIAD EXAMPLES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO WATCH THE DAILY SHOW SEGMENT ON GENDER TAX FOR MORE. DONE IN ITS SLIGHTLYEDGY BUT NO LESS HUMOROUS APPROACH TO THE FACT THAT WOMEN DO INDEED PAY MORE FOR PRODUCTS THURMOND. AND ADD THAT TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE PAID LESS. THIS CREATES A GENDER GAP THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE FIXED IT'S REAL AND IT'S DISCRIMINATORY. I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THE GENDER TAXES CHOSE TO RIP OFF WELL IT IS A RIPOFF BUT I SHOULD BE TO YOU THAT IT IS FAR MORE THAN JUST A RIPOFF. A RIPOFF THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE EQUALLY IS A RIP OFF. A RIP OFF THAT IMPACTS A PROTECTED CLASS MORE THAN IT DOES EVERYONE ELSE. THIS TEXTBOOK DISCRIMINATION. YOU MAY SAY WELL IF THEY'RE BASICALLY THE SAME PRODUCT WOMEN SHOULD JUST GO FIND THE MEN'S VERSION AT THE CHEAPER PRICE AND BUY IT. TO WHICH I MUST ASK EVEN ASSUMING THAT WE ALL KNEW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE MEN'S VERSION. WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO DO THAT? WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO GO THAT EXTRA MILE TO TRACK DOWN THE EQUIVALENT PRODUCT? TRUE GENDER EQUITY DEMANDS BETTER THAN THAT. AND BEFORE THIRD TURNING THINGS OVER TO MY WITNESSES ARE WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE BILL. AND I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. I THINK THE TIME IS NOW WE HAVE TO CLOSE THAT GAP THERE MAY BE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN TWEAKING THIS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I WENT AFTER THE WHOLE QUESTION OF GENDER INEQUALITY IN IN FAIR PAY AND WE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE WITH THE OPPOSITION TO NOT DISAGREE -- END AND IT CAME TO A CONSENSUS WHICH IS NOW BEEN FOLLOWED BY FORTY ONE OTHER STATES USING THAT MODEL IN ORDER TO GET FAIR PAYIN THEIR STATES. FIRST THE OPPONENTS SAY THAT MANY THINGS GOING TO WHAT IS -- WHAT DETERMINES THE PRICE? PRICE COULD DIFFER BETWEEN A MALE VERSION OF A PRODUCT IN A FEMALE VERSION OF A PRODUCT FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS. MANY OF WHICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH GENDER. FAIR ENOUGH BUT THE BILL ACCOUNTS FOR THIS. THE BILL PROHIBITS DIFFERENTIAL PRICING BASED ON GENDER. ONLY.% IT WOULD NOT PROHIBIT BUSINESSES. FROM SETTING PRICES FOR ANY BONA FIDE REASON OTHER THAN GENDER. FOLLOWING THE TRACK THE WE TOOK WITH EQUAL PAY. IF YOU HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON TO PAY SOMEBODY DIFFERENTLY THAT'S A BONA FIDE FACTOR THAT HAS NO GENDER BASIS YOU CAN DO THAT THE SAME THING HERE. IF YOU CAN SHOW THAT THE REASON THAT YOU'RE CHARGING MORE IS NOT GENDER BASED YOU CAN DO THAT SO TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT I'M OFFERING AN AMENDMENT TODAY. THAT STATES THAT MUCH EXPLICITLY -- BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE PRICE THEY SAID AS LONG AS THEY DON'T SEVEN BASED ON GENDER. SECOND THE OPPONENTS HAVE ARGUED THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSOCIATE A PRODUCT WITH THE GENDER WITHOUT. WITHOUT RESORTING THE GENDER STEREOTYPES THAT THIS CRITICISM I FIND A BIT RICH WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW HEAVILY MANY BUSINESSES RELY ON STEREOTYPES FOR MARKETING. I THINK OF THINGS LIKE SELLING A CARL'S JUNIOR BURGER. THOSE BIG WHOPPER BURGERS HAVING WOMEN HALF UNDRESSED DROOLING OVER A BURGER. BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT EXACTLY TRYING TO APPEAL TO WOMEN WHO ARE GOING TO EAT FIVE POUNDS OF BEEF ANYWAY BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU HAVE. OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE AN ATTEMPT TO USE THOSE GENDER STEREOTYPES IN YOUR MARKETING. BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS AS BIG A PROBLEM AS OPPONENTS WOULD HAVE YOU TO BELIEVE MANY PRODUCTS ARE CLEARLY LABELED ARE ADVERTISED AS FOR MEN OR FOR WOMEN. MANY PRODUCTS ARE CLEARLY PLACED IN A MAN'S DEPARTMENT OR WOMEN'S DEPARTMENT. WAS SO SHE SAID IN A PRODUCT WITH THE GENDER IN THOSE CASES IS CLEARLY A STRAIGHTFORWARD ASSOCIATION. AND IN THOSE CASES WHERE THE INDISCHE ARE MORE SUBTLE AND RELY ON HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION WITH GENDER THINGS LIKE COLOR THE WALKER SANTA FOR INSTANCE. THE BILL TRUST THE FACT FINDERS TO USE OUR COMMON SENSE AS WE OFTEN DO IN THE LAW. TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THE PINK SCOOTER WITH THE PICTURE THE PONY ON IT IS BEING PARKING A PRIMARILY TO GIRLS. EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SAY SO RIGHT ON THE LABEL AND THAT'S SAID BY THE WAY THAT PINK SCOOTER. COSTS TEN DOLLARS MORE THAN THE BLUE SCOOTER. AND AGAIN BASED ON A DIFFERENTIAL. SET BY GENDER SO THAT SAID IF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL COULD BE IMPROVED BY IMPROVING FURTHER GUIDANCE ON HOW TO IDENTIFY GENDER FOR WHICH A PRODUCT IS INTENDED AND MARKETED. AND THAT'S CONVERSATION ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO HAVE. FINALLY. ARE GONE FINALLY THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL OF RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE REMEDY IS THIS BILL PROVIDES IN THE EVENT THAT A BUSINESSES CAUGHT SETTING PRICES BASED ON GENDER ALONE. THE MINIMUM PENALTY OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AS A AS WELL AS AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. SOME OF YOU EXPRESSED POSSIBLE CONCERNS IS CREATES A NEW CAUSE OF ACTION. IN FACT. THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME SET OF REMEDIES IS ALREADY EXIST UNDER THE ON RESERVE RIGHT CHECKED WHAT WE'RE BASICALLY DOING IS WE PUT SERVICES IN HONOR OF WHICH IS SIMPLY ABOUT A PUT GOODS IN THE SAME ON RESERVOIR CHECK. IN OTHER WORDS BUSINESSES ARE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO ANY FORM OF LIABILITY THAT ISN'T ALREADY OUT THERE. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THESE REMEDIES COULD NOW BEACH PURSUED FOR GENDER BASED PRICING OF CONSUMER GOODS AS WELL AS SERVICES. AND AS THINGS STAND THE AND RESERVE ARIGHT CHECK MAYOR OF ALREADY APPLY TO GENDER BASED CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUT THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS CLEAR. SO ALL RIGHT -- IT'S LATE I'VE GOT MANY MORE COMMENTS SO I COULD MAKE I'M VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT WE HAVE HERE TODAY TO ST MARTIN. MARTIN DEAL WITH CONSUMER REPORTS SIGNAL SHE OVER HERNANDEZ REPRESENTING THE CONSUMER'S BETTER. A FEDERATION TO CALIFORNIA I I COULD ALSO INDICATE AS WELL THAT SENATOR. THE CONGRESSWOMAN A SPEAR IS NOW JUST INTRODUCED A SIMILAR BILL IN CONGRESS. TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST BASTIONS OF THE KIND OF DISCRIMINATION THAT WE'VE GOT TO END AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- PLEASE IF YOU HAVE A KEY TO TWO MINUTES IF YOU CAN. FIND START WITH YOUR NAY KEEP IT SHORTER THAN THAT HA HA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BUY STERN MEMBERS IN MARIN DOUBLE CONSUMER REPORTS FORMALLY KNOWN AS CONSUMERS UNION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE ALSO SUPPORT THE THE FEDERAL EFFORTS. I THINK THAT -- THAT THE CHAIR -- RAISES A GREAT POINT WHICH IS YOU KNOW JUST DISCLOSURES AND PUTTING THE ONUS ON THE CONSUMER TO SOMEHOW SEARCHING FIND -- THE THE LOWER PRICED OPTION IS IS OFTEN ON WORKABLE AND SAY PARTICULARLY IN INCREASINGLY EACH COMMERCE ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING FOR THINGS ONLINE. AND THEY'RE BEING MARKETED IN A VERY TRGETED FASHION GIVEN THAT MACHINE LEARNING CAN LOOK AT ALL YOUR PAST HISTORIES AND DOES SO MUCH BIG DATA FLOATING AROUND ABOUT ALL OF US YOU MAY NOT REALLY BE ABLE TO GET THE FULL PICTURE. OF THE KINDS OF SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND MAY EVEN BE OUT THERE IN ORDER TO FIND A LOWER COST OPTION AND YOU KNOW CONSUMER REPORTS CONSUMERS UNION WAS FOUNDED ON THE PREMISE THAT PEOPLE NOT JUST NEED UNBIASED INFORMATION BUT THEY NEED TO HAVE. RULES OF THE ROAD PUT IN PLACE SO THAT THE MARKET'S NOT RIGGED AGAINST THEM -- AND SO THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHERE WE WE WE REALLY NEED TO PUT THE ONUS ON THE RESPONSIBILITY. MORE APPROPRIATELY ON THOSE WERE IN THE BEST POSITION TO KNOW -- HOW TO PRICE THESE THINGS FAIRLY IN THAT WOULD BE WITH RETAILERS AND MANUFACTURERS SO HE WAS VERY COMMONSENSE NEARLY TERREL TAILORED MEASURE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING IT FORWARD? SHE CARE NOT SURE HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CNSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA VERY PROUD SPONSORS OF THE MEASURE I THINK CENTER JACKSON CAPTURED. YOU REALLY THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THIS ISSUE IS AN ENEMY JUST HAD A COUPLE OF THINGS AND ONE IS IN THE IN THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING. A CONSUMER FEDERATION IN THE YEARS BEFORE THAT WE HAVE REGULARLY TRYING TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS SUCH AS THIS WHERE CONSUMERS ARE BEING OVER CHARGED AND JUSTLY BEING CHARGED -- FOR SOMETHING -- AND SO WE RARELY TRY TO TAKE THESE ISSUES ON WE'VE DEALT WITH IT IN TELECOM A WEATHER SCREEN AT THE CRAMMING IN CERTAIN FEES ON A PHONE BILLS -- WE'VE DEALT WITH IT IT WITH RETAILERS WERE THEY ADVERTISE ONE PRICE THE CHARGE ANOTHER I MEAN WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ON AND ON THE ONE THING THAT -- WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IS. THIS GENDER PRICING DIFFERENCE. AND IT WAS ADDRESS ON SERVICES WE DID SUPPORT THOSE BILLS. THE THING TO ME THAT'S THAT STANDS OUT THE MOST IS. ONE RETAILERS ARE VERY DELIBERATE HOW THE PRICE PRODUCTS AND WHERE THE PLACE PRODUCTS -- SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE IT ISN'T BY ACCIDENT THAT THE PRICING IS DIFFERENT IT'S VERY DELIBERATE AND REALLY THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO GET TO THOSE DECISIONS. IS TO GET TO THAT BEHAVIOR WHERE THEY'RE DELIBERATELY CHARGING DIFFERENT. FOR FOR SIMPLY BASED ON GENDER -- IT IS IT DOESN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT. THE THING I'M GONNA HAS A LITTLE YOU KNOW POINT OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW I OFTEN -- CONSULT WITH A LOT OF EXPERTS ON ON ISSUES BEFORE I TESTIFY AND BILLS THAT I WORK ON FOR THIS WHEN I ASKED MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE BECOMING VERY VERY AWARE. OF A LOT OF ISSUES AND SHE ON OUR OWN IS BROUGHT UP TO ME -- THE ISSUE OF THE TAX ON HIM AND HYGIENE PRODUCTS AND OTHER THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. I THINK HER WORDS REALLY CAPTURE ONE EXPLAINED HER WITH THIS ISSUE WAS ABOUT THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT YOU THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. IF YOU GO TO MEN'S -- DEPARTMENT VERSES WHIMS DEPARTMENT EXPLAINED THE JUST CHARGE DIFFERENTLY RAZORS IN PARTICULAR IS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. I THINK SHE CAPTURED ISSUES AS WELL THAT'S RIDICULOUS THAT WAS HER RESPONSE AND IT'S HARD FOR ME BOTH AS AN ADVOCATE ON THESE ISSUES BUT ALSO AS A FATHER TO EXPLAIED OR WHY IT'S OKAY. EXPLAINED OR WHY THE LEGISLATURE WON'T TAKE ACTION ON THIS WHY ARE WE JUST GONNA SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND SAY WELL -- IT'S JUST HOW IT IS. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FIX IS PRETTY EASY. WHEN A RETAILER HAS THE SAME PRODUCT? THIS CHARGE THE SAME WE'VE SEEN THIS ALREADY WERE SOME OF THE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN ADDRESS HAVE BEEN ADDRESS WHERE SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES -- ON THE SCOOTERS WHAT NOT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED THE BIKE HELMETS YOU START SEEING NOW THEY'RE BEING PRICE THE SAME. AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAT IF MY DAUGHTER WALKS UP TO THE REGISTER WITH WHAT WITH ONE PRODUCT MY SON WALKS UP WITH THE THE SAME PRODUCT WHICH IS BLUE VERSUS PINK. AND THEY CHARGE MY DAUGHTER MORE. AND MY SON. ITS CHARGE LESS. THAT'S A PROBLEM IT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE CAN'T IGNORE ANYMORE FOR THOSE REASONS ROUTES FOR SUPPORT. THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE -- INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND YOUR AFFILIATION. LAND TROUT NOT BEHALF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA WE COMMENDED THE AUTHOR FOR HER CONTINUED CHAMPION OF US. EQUITY THANK YOU WE ARE TONIGHT. GOOD EVENING MY THE DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU I DO WE HAVE -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. FOLLOWED THEREAFTER BY -- INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO GO TO THE MICROPHONE. LEAVE ME. ONE ALL RIGHT WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER FOR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SORRY WE JUST RECEIVED AND LIKE IN THE SIDE -- ANYWAYS I WAS A PART OF THE ACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS ON THE EQUAL PAY ACT AND WAS HAPPY TO ALTERNATELY BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT BILL BUT THIS BILL. IS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT -- AND IT'S NOT THE SAME SCENARIO AND I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT ISSUE IF MY TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD SON WENT UP TO THE REGISTER AND AT THE POINT OF SALE. WHEN THEY WERE BOTH WITH A BLUE RACER AND HANDS MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD SON WAS CHARGED A LOWER PRICE THE MY TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SIMPLY BECAUSE OF GENDER? BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE WE'RE DEALING WITH -- AT PRICE DIFFERENCE -- BASED UPON TWO PRODUCTS WHICH THE CONSUMER CAN CHOOSE WHICH PRODUCT THEY CHOOSE AND IT'S NOT AT THE POINT OF SALE IN WHICH SOMEBODY IS GETTING CHARGED A DIFFERENT PRICE BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER. SO IT'S NOT THE SAME WITH REGARDS TO THE DISCRIMINATION THAT THE UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT GENERALLY TRIES TO COVER IT'S NOT THE SAME AS SERVICES WHEN THE SAME EXACT SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. BUT AT A DIFFERENT PRICE BECAUSE OF GENDER THIS IS TWO PRODUCTS THAT WERE HAVING TO ASSOCIATE THE GENDER WITH AND AGAIN IT'S TWO PRODUCTS OF THE CONSUMER HAS A CHOICE WITH REGARDS TO WHICH ONE TO BUY -- I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL. YES IT IS AN EXISTING STATUTE -- IT PROVIDES A MINIMUM FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY OR DAMAGES NO MATTER WHAT THE ACTUAL VIOLATION IS AND NO MATTER WHAT THE ACTUAL PRICE DIFFERENTIAL IS. AND SO WE'VE SEEN THIS BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME ENFORCEMENT STATUTE WITH REGARDS TO EIGHTY LITIGATION WE'VE SEEN THIS BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME ENFORCEMENT STATUTE THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE EXISTING GENDER TAX REPEAL ACT FOR SERVICES AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN. IS THERE IS AN INCENTIVE BECAUSE OF THAT MINIMUM FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STATUTORY DAMAGES TO FILE FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION AGAINST COMPANIES A LOT OF THEM SMALL BUSINESSES WITH THIS WITH THIS TYPE OF AMBLIN MINE. ONE I HAD BECAUSE IT'S AN AUTOMATIC FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS ALTHOUGH WHEN THEY'RE WITH ANY ALLEGED VIOLATION TO THE COMPANY. AND I KNOW THAT THE COMPANY IS GOING TO MAKE A CAP A COST ANALYSIS THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS THIS DEMAND FOR FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT. IT'S WORTH IT TO GO AND FIGHT IN COURT WHICH WILL COST THEM OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PROVE THAT THE ISSUE WAS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR AS PROPOSED TO BE DEFINED IN THE BILL OR THAT IT WAS BASED UPON A GENDER NEUTRAL REASON WHICH IS WHY THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. ACTUALLY DON'T ADDRESS OUR ISSUE AND WHEN THEY'RE EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LITIGATION COSTS TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE RIGHT FOR SUCH AS PAIN THE FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT IN THE STATUTE. IT'S A COST ANALYSIS IN A BUSINESS JUDGEMENT THAT THE ULTIMATELY HAVE TO MAKE SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND OTHERS THAT I CAN'T FIT AND WE ARE OPPOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MARGARET GLANCING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION I APPRECIATE AUTHORS CONCERN ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WOMEN FACE TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE THAT ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WE DO NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST. PEOPLE BY GENDER -- AS MISS BREYER INDICATED. A BOY OR GIRL MAN OR WOMAN. PLAY THE SAME PLACE FOR A BLUE OR A PINK RAZOR WE PRICE DIFFERENTLY WE DO PRICE ITEMS DIFFERENTLY BASED ON COLOR SIZE. OF MARKETING COSTS A SUPPLY AND DEMAND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS ABSOLUTELY -- FROM DAY TO DAY IN STORE TO STORE YOU CAN GO AND FIND. BLUE SCOOTERS ON SALE IN ONE STORE BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN IN FOR AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF BLUE SCOOTERS YOU CAN FIND. PINK SCOOTERS ON SALE IN THE OTHER STORE BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF PINK SCOOTERS. IN THAT PARTICULAR STORE PRICES IT JUST NOW VERA BILLY AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN FACT IN THE E. COMMERCE WORLD TODAY WE OFTEN PRICE MATCH WITH CUSTOMER SHOWING US OUR PHONE AND SAYING WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MATCH THE PRICE OF BECAUSE I FOUND A BETTER PRICE ONLINE. THIS BILL CREATES A ONE PRICE FITS ALL MODEL THAT DOESN'T RIVER. REFLECT HELD BUSINESSES CHOOSE CHOOSER PRICING MODELS AND HOW THEY OPERATE TODAY THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MEMBERS THE PUBLIC -- OR REPRESENTATIVES THIS BE OPPORTUNITY -- TO APPROACH THE MIKE INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN YOUR AFFILIATION IN YOUR POSITION. THANK YOU ALLORA SECESSIONISTS HERE IN OPPOSITION ON BEHALF OF THE TôI ASSOCIATION WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THAT MARGARET AND JENNIFER THINK. THANK YOU. PEROT COOK FORTHE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE OPPOSE. EHRMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. AS CHAIR MEMBERS CLICK AWESOME HALF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS IN IN OPPOSITION. SINCE WE SELL. ONE OF THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE STILL NEGOTIABLE THIS BILL IS CLEARLY A PROBLEMATIC SINCE WE DON'T CONTROL OUR MARKETING THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS DO THAT'S ALSO PROBLEMATIC FOR US WE STAND STRONG UP THAT'S IN OPPOSITION CORRECT. MR TURN MEMBERS MIKE BELOW FOR THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA OPPOSED. MISTER CHAIR IN THE MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBER THE PUBLIC WISHING TO COMMENT THIS OF THAT OPPORTUNITY SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE DAIS -- SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANK MANAGER OF THE QUICK QUESTION FOLLOW ON TO ONE OF THE OPPONENTS IS WITH RESPECT TO AUTOMOBILES SO FOR EXAMPLE WE JUST BOUGHT A CAR MY WIFE NEGOTIATED GOT A MUCH BETTER PRICE. OF IS IT. IF YOU'RE JUST I I'M I'M THINKING THAT THIS BILL ONLY PERTAINS TO LISTED PRICES IT DOESN'T PERTAIN TO NEGOTIATED PRICE IS THAT CORRECT. IT'S NOT INTENDED TO DEAL WITH WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THE PRICE IF THE CAR'S ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE CAR. IT'S ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE CAR THE REASONS THAT IT'S ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IF IF -- A AND I CAN'T THINK OF AN EXAMPLE WITH A CAR WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GENDER BASE PRICE -- I DO KNOW THAT CAR DEALERS THERE USED TO BE -- DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PRICING SO -- IN THAT SHOULDN'T AFFECT THE CAR AT ALL I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE EXAMPLE OF WHEN THAT WOULD BE. SO WE'RE JUST TOM OF THE STICKER PRICE OR NOT TALK ABOUT THE NEGOTIATED PRICE RIGHT RIGHT YET WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT NEGOTIATED PRICES HERE THAT THAT'S TO THAT'S TOO SUBJECTIVE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS IF YOU GO TO THE GROW IF YOU GO TO THE STORE YOU GO -- TO A DUG STORE. AND YOUR WOMAN AND YOU WANT TO BUY MOTRIN BECAUSE YOU'RE HAVING. SOME MENSTRUAL CRAMPS. SO RIGHT NEXT TO THE MOTRIN OR THERE IS THE MOTRIN IS THERE AND THERE'S ONE A PACKAGE THAT SAYS WILL HELP WITH MENSTRUAL CRAMPS. AND RIGHT NEXT TO IT IS ANOTHER PACKAGE OF MOTRIN THE DOESN'T MENTION MENSTRUAL CRAMPS. THEY ACTUALLY CHARGE MORE FOR THE MOTRIN THAT MENTIONS MENSTRUAL CRAMPS EVEN THOUGH IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME PRODUCT. EXACTLY EVERY BIT OF IT IS THE SAME IT'S JUST PACKAGE DIFFERENT AND THEY CHARGE THE WOMEN FIFTEEN CENTS A PILL. AND IF YOU BUY THE REGULAR MOTRIN IT'S SEVEN CENTS A PILL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S A KIND OF DISCRIMINATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S IT. OUR CENTER ALLEN [inaudible] WELL [inaudible] I'M. I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS I I AM A DEMOCRAT WHO IS -- ACTUALLY COMFORTABLE WITH THE TERMS -- SOCIALISM AND CAPITALISM -- I THINK THAT THEY ACTUALLY LIVE WELL TOGETHER IN A LOT OF PLACES AND EUROPE AND EVEN HERE IN UNITED STATES IN MANY RESPECTS AND I GUESS THIS IS RESPECT THIS. REFLECTS SUCH A INCURSION INTO BASIC MARKET [inaudible] OUR ACTIVITY THAT I AM I'M STRUGGLING WITH -- WITH WITH. WITH THIS. ARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK IN THE END OF THE DAY YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO HOW TO HOW TO HOW TO HOW TO PROVE GENDER DISCRIMINATION I UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE DIFFICULT THING TO DO BUT IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE IN IN. IT YOU KNOW AT A KIND OF GOING ON FISHING EXPEDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TRYING. TO TRYING TO MEET THE STANDARDS HERE AND SO I I'M I'M SENSITIVE TO WHAT YOU JUST REYES ON THE MOTOR IN CASE I THINK THAT THAT. COULD POTENTIALLY RACISM. YOU GUYS DECEPTIVE PRACTICES ISSUES BUT I'M. YOU KNOW I I I STILL CONTINUE TO SAY TO MYSELF. IF IF IF THERE'S COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT CHARGE MORE FOR THE PAIN GREATER THAN THE BLUE AS A WHY ISN'T THERE. THE THE BEAUTY OF THE FREE MARKET IS YOU GET SOME ENTREPRENEUR WHO COMES IN IN SELLS. A PIC MARKET AT THE SAME PRICES THE BLUE AS SORT OF A PINK RAZOR THIS IS AS AS THE SAME PRICE AS THE BLUE RYES OR AND AND I'M. I'M NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHY. DO WHY WHY THERE'S NOT WHAT WHY THAT'S NOT -- PROVIDING FOR I THE ISSUES THAT THE YOU'VE BEEN RAISING. WELL BECAUSE THEY CHARGE BECAUSE THE TOP -- THE END OF MY I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IF WE MAKE THAT IT IF WE PROHIBIT GENDER BASED PRICING THEN THEY WILL SELL THEM FOR THE SAME. BUT THE QUESTION COMES WHY SHOULD WHY SHOULD A WOMAN HAVE TO TAKE AN EXTRA STEP. TO GET THE BEST PRICE FOR A PRODUCT BECAUSE SHE'S BEING CHARGE MORE THIS OF WOMAN THAT IS GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY DOES WITH RESPECT MADAM CHAIR I MEAN YOU KNOW WE WERE LOOKED UP SOME OF THE NUMBERS YOU REYES WE WE LOOKED UP ONLINE. AND WE FOUND SOME OF THE WOMEN'S ISSUES WOMEN'S ITEMS TO DON DISCOUNT -- ON ON SOME IS THAT MUCH LOWER THE PRICE OF THE YOU'RE QUOTING. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU'RE SHOPPING YOU WILL. AND YOU SEE THAT'S FINE IF IT'S A NON GENDER BASED -- THE DECISION THEN YOU WILL YOU'RE FINE IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO DISCOUNT SOMETHING AND YOU CAN SHOW LOOK I'M DISCOUNTING THIS BECAUSE I GOT FIVE THOUSAND OPEN -- AND I WANT TO CLEAR MY INVENTORY THAT'S A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE REASON. IT'S THAT IF YOU HAVE TWO BANDS AND YOU WANT TO CLEAR YOUR INVENTORY YOU'RE STILL CHARGING MORE FOR THE FEMALE VERSION THAT'S DISCRIMINATION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS. BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO AND IF WE WERE GOING TO IF YOU IF YOU WILL HAVE TRADE CHANGE THAT WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY IT WOULD HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED. THIS PROBLEM IS ENDEMIC THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT RESOLVED AND I THINK WHAT'S CLEARLY IMPORTANT IS THAT IT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WOMEN AND I THINK TOO I THINK THAT GOOD EXAMPLE YOU GOUP TO THE TO THE COUNTER -- I GET MY GRANDDAUGHTER A LITTLE HAVE. A HELMET -- FOR FOR BIKE AND IT'S PINK AND IT'S THIRTY NINE NINETY FIVE IN MY LITTLE GRANDSON ONCE A BLUE ONE AND HIS. TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE AND THAT'S AND THAT IS A FACT THAT IS GENDER BASED PRICING IN THAT SHOULD BE UNLAWFUL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE -- WE CAN -- WE CAN TALK ALL WE WANT -- BUT IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO STAND PAT ON THIS AND ALLOW THAT DISCRIMINATION TO CONTINUE I MENTIONED EARLY ON THAT I'D BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR TWENTY YEARS -- AND WE STILL HAVEN'T MADE THOSE STRIDES BECAUSE COMPANIES DO IT BECAUSE THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. WOMEN DO PAY MORE SHOULD WOMEN HAVE TO THEN TAKE THAT NEXT STEP THEY GO TO THE THEY GO TO THE STORE THEY GO INTO THE WOMEN'S SECTION OF A GAP. BECAUSE I WANT TO BUY CLOTHES THAT FIT THEM SO THEY'RE GOING TO THE WOMEN'S SECTION AND THERE ARE THEIR CHARGE MORE THAN IF THEY WENT INTO THE MEN'S SECTION. SO WHAT WE GONNA SAY WELL WOMEN IF YOU WANT TO PAY WHAT MEN PAY YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE MEN'S SECTION WHY IS. TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL IT THAT THERE'S THERE IT IS DISCRIMINATION IT SHOULD BE UNLAWFUL AND IF WE DO NOTHING THE ANNUAL COST TO CALIFORNIA WOMEN. WHO HAVE TO PAY MORE IS THE TUNE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN CALIFORNIA THE WOMEN PAY MORE BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY BECAUSE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE WOMEN? THAT'S DISCRIMINATION THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE MARKET THE MARKET THE MARKET THE MARKET'S GOING TO CHARGE WHAT IT CAN WHAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO BEAR. UNLESS WE SAY TO THE MARKET YOU KNOW MARKET. YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF GENDER WHEN YOU PRICE THESE THINGS IF YOU'VE GOT OTHER REASONS ABSOLUTELY. TOTALLY FAIR TOTALLY APPROPRIATE BUT IF YOU'RE DOING IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE. ARE YOU CAN CHARGE MORE OF FOR A A FOR MOTRIN THAT SAYS HEY LISTEN IF YOU'VE GOT MENSTRUAL CRAMPS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. AND CHARGING TWICE AS MUCH FOR A BILL -- AS YOU DO WITH THE REGULAR BOX THE MOTRIN THAT SERVES THE SAME PURPOSE WE DO WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU BUY CORNFLAKES IT TURNS OUT THEY MAKE THE SAME QUOTE THEY MAKE THE SAME CORNFLAKES AT AT THE SAME PLACE AND AND THE KROGER BRAND IS HALF. THE PRICE IS THE KELLOGG BUT IT'S NOT BEING CHAIR IT'S NOT BEING CHARGED THE PRICE ISN'T BASED ON GENDER. IT MAY BE THAT THE SAME COMPANY MAKES A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT BRAND NAMES BUT IT'S WHEN YOU CHARGE MORE BASED ON GENDER THAT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING AFTER NOT THE DIFFERENCES. NOT THE DIFFERENTIALS IN PRICES THE MARKET CONTINUES TO BE ROBUST WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS YOU TRUST CAN'T DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF OF THE THE MUSCLE CRAMPS THING IS A CLEAR GENDER ISSUE BUT WELL BUT IT'S NOT ILLEGAL. ISN'T NECESSARILY I MEAN I YOU KNOW ONE OF OUR YOU KNOW I MEAN I THAT THAT THAT THERE ARE SOME MALES WHO LOVE PINK GREAT. YEAH AND THERE ARE NO. BUT MOST MOST MOST MEN WOULD PREFER TO GET THE BLACK THEN THE PINK AND THEY'D AND THE MANUFACTURERS KNOW THAT. AND THEY CHARGE MORE FOR THE PINK. BUT BUT ARE WE GONNA ARE WE GOING TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AND LAW THAT THAT THEY PINK IS FOR GIRLS IN BLACK IS FOR MEN IS THAT KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IS A DETERMINATION IF YOU CHARGE MORE FOR PAYING. THAN YOU DO FOR BLACK AND IT'S THE SAME PRODUCT IT'S LIKELY TO BE GENDER BASED BIAS AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS [inaudible] THANK. DO YOU EVER MORE MORE QUESTIONS CENTER ALAN. YEAH WE CAN COME BACK HERE IF IF YOU WISH -- CENTER CABALLERO. SO I AM. PRECIADO THE THE DISCUSSION AND AND I'M AYE INTELLECTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE IS IS THIS IS THAT -- I'VE I'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH SMALL BUSINESSES -- ALL OVER MY DISTRICT AND AND FRANKLY THERE'S THERE THEY STRUGGLE -- THEY STRUGGLE. TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE PUT ON THEM SO TO USE YOUR YOUR EXAMPLE. OF THE HELMET. THE END UP WITH THE SMALL MOM AND POP -- LATINO BUSINESS ANYWHERE IN THE VALLEY. AND THEY'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF OF PRODUCTS [inaudible] THAT ARE. THAT DEFINE A DEFINITION IN TERMS OF THEIR STORE THEY MAY HAVE SOME FOOD PRODUCTS THEY MAY HAVE SOME GOOD PRODUCTS. AND THEY BUY WHAT THEY THINK WILL SELL IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE MAKING A DECISION BASED ON BASED ON THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE PRICE POINTS AND SO YOU HAVE A PAIN CAN YOU HAVE A BLUE. THEY'VE ORDERED THESE HELMETS -- AND THEY'RE NOT MOVING AND THEY DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOWER THE PRICE A RAISE THE PRICE. THE CHALLENGES IF THEY'RE NOT PRICE. EXACTLY THE SAME IT GIVES SOMEONE THE ABILITY TO WALK IN. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE SHELF SAY YOUR PRICING THE PINK HIGHER THAN THE BLUE. I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S DISCRIMINATION. I'M GOING TO SUE YOU. AND THEN YOU HAVE A BY A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER THAT IS LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF A LAWSUIT OVER SOMETHING THAT THEY NEVER EVER INTENDED RIGHT THE THEY'RE PUTTING THESE THINGS ON SALE I WANT TO GET HIM TO MOVE. MAYBE THE THAT THE THAT PINK'S HAVEN'T BEEN MOVING BUT THE BLUES HAVE BEEN WHATEVER. BUT THEY THEY IT'S NOT A DECISION BASED ON I'M GOING TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST GIRLS. IT'S A DISCRIMINATE TO IT'S A DECISION BASED ON THE BEST WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND MOVING THINGS AND SELLING THINGS AND THEN THEY'RE NOT. THEN THEY'RE NOT VIOLATING THE LAW. BUT THE BUT THE POTENTIAL THE POTENTIAL FOR SOMEONE TO SHAKE HIM DOWN FOR THE FOURTH WE ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT SEE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SHAKEDOWN LAWSUITS WHICH ARE. REALLY OF FICTION WE DON'T SEE THE SHAKEDOWN LAWSUITS HAVE TO TELL YOU I'VE BEEN IN THIS WE SEE THE WORLD TOTALLY DIFFERENT -- WELL I'D I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN HOW MANY SHAKEDOWN LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN IN YOUR COMMUNITY -- WE HAVE -- I I KNOW THERE. THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ADA YOU SHOULD WE NOW GIVE OF RIGHT TO CURE -- THERE THERE WAS ONE LAW FIRM I REMEMBER BACK IN THE OLD DAY AND THEY WE PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS OF ON THE BASIS OF EXTORTION BECAUSE TO SHAKE DOWN IS EXTORTION. AND IT'S A CRIME IT IS BUT THE PROBLEM IS IS IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND IN THE EIGHTY EIGHT ROME IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. BUT IT SO YOU GO TO YOUR D. A. AND YOU SAY I'M BEING SHAKEN DOWN BY THIS FIRM YOU SEE. TO TO TO CONFLATE THE TWO MAIN SHOW WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING PROBLEMS BECAUSE PEOPLE. BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY AND WE HEAR IS A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT WE HAVE WE HAVE FIRST FOR YOU NOT GOING TO BRING A LAWSUIT IT'S JUST FINISH BY SAYING. THAT THAT THAT THE MY CONCERN IT. I AS I SAID WHEN I STARTED INTELLECTUALLY I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT THE NET EFFECT OF IT IS IT THE NUMBER OF GENDER BASED. DIFFERENTIAL PRICING IS IS VERY SMALL IN COMPARISON TO ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT PEOPLE PEOPLE BY. AND AND IT YES THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BUT I DON'T SEE THAT THOSE DEFENSES BECOME EASILY UNDERSTOOD. OR EASILY EIGHT EASY TO DEFEND YOURSELF AGANST BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN SOMEBODY SEND YOU A LETTER SAYING. WERE OMINOUS TO YOU ON THIS ISSUE PEOPLE PANIC AND THEY GO AND THEY SPEND MONEY ON ATTORNEYS AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THAT'S A KIND OF ACTION AND REACTION THAT I'M. THAT I'M JUST NOT IN INTERESTED IN PUTTING IN PUTTING ON THE BACKS OF YEAH I MEAN IT'S EASY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MOTRIN. I MEAN BECAUSE THEY'RE A BIG COMPANY AND FRANKLY I DO JUST THAT THINK THAT'S DECEPTIVE -- PRACTICE A DECEPTIVE PRACTICE IN THE OUGHT TO BE SUED FOR IT BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GENDER BASED AS MUCH AS IT IS THEY FIGURED OUT WHAT IT IS THAT'S GOING TO MOVE PEOPLE AND WHAT IT IS GENDER BASED. IT IS GENERATIONAL ME CHILL SUGGEST YOU THAT. WOMEN ON AVERAGE PAY AT LEAST THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR MORE FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THEN THEN MEN DO SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR MALL YOU'RE YOU'RE LOW INCOME WORKERS WHO GOES INTO A STORE. MAKING MINIMUM WAGE OR AS A WOMAN MAKING LESS THAN WATER MALE COUNTERPARTS MAKING AND IS GOING TO SPEND A THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE ON AVERAGE A YEAR. FOR PRODUCTS BECAUSE COMPANIES FEEL AND ARE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH CHARGING MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE WOMEN. IF YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY IT'S KIND OF HARD TO ARGUE. THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THESE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS TO SHAKE DOWN LAWSUIT WE THE END RESERVE A RIGHT TO ACT NOW APPLIES TO SERVICES. BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING A PLETHORA OF LAWSUITS BASED UPON THIS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE -- ANTICIPATE BUT HAVE NOT BEEN REALIZED AND WE THE END TO TO SAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT. CIVIL RIGHTS ON THE END AND ALLOW FOR LITIGATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS VIOLATED GIVES PEOPLE REMEDY. BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK THIS NOTION THAT ALL WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE SKY IS FALLING IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN IT HASN'T HAPPENED. AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IF WE MAKE IT CLEAR. THAT -- THAT WE ARE. NOT GOING TO A BY THIS KIND OF GENDER BASED PRICING. AND MAKE IT CLEAR TO PEOPLE I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT MAYBE -- GRADUALLY PUTTING THIS IN SO THAT EMPLOYEE THAT ARE THE COMPANIES WILL KNOW THAT THAT THAT THIS IS NOT AT THAT THIS IS UNLAWFUL -- GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO REEVALUATE TO IF THEY LOOK IN THE SMALL STORE THEY CHARGING MORE FOR PRODUCT BECAUSE THEY HINK GIRLS WILL PAY MORE WOMEN -- PAY MORE AND THEN THEY FIND OUT THAT ISN'T APPROPRIATE GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE OUT. BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PINK TAX IT'S REAL AND IT HAS A VERY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WOMEN IN OUR SOCIETY. SO WHAT ARE I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES WHAT I'M SAYING IS I THINK WE CAN RESOLVE THIS BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. GOING ON FOR TOO LONG AND IT DOES HAVE A OF REALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WOMEN -- COVER YOUR AND GIVE MORE MORE QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT -- CENTER JONES CENTER I'M BURKE. THANK YOU SIR WORKS NATURE -- SENATE JACKSON I'VE I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE PROBLEM THE YEAR OUTLINING AND I ACTUALLY WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK -- BECAUSE MY MAIN CONCERN REMINDS THE REMAINS OF PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT I WAS JUST GOING TO QUIETLY VOTE NO -- BUT I'VE GOT HAS JUMPED TO THE DEFENSE OF A CENTER CABALLERO ON THIS BECAUSE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION UNDER THE EIGHTY EIGHT SCHEME. DID BECAUSE THE SKY TO FALL IN MANY COMMUNITIES I HAVE THREE MOUNTAIN RULE TOWNS -- ONE OF THEM THAT'S A VERY POPULAR TOURIST AREA. THAT. THESE ARE SCAM LAWSUITS. pBUSINESS CENTER OF THESE. OF THESE MOUNTAIN TOWNS WE'VE GOT [inaudible] I'VE GOT. OUR BUILDINGS CAN COMMUNITY AREAS IN IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW. THAT A BUSINESS WAS WIPED OUT. PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THESE EIGHTY A LAWSUIT THE PRIVATE RIGHT TO CURE. THERE ARE STILL VACANT EIGHT YEARS LATER. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO MOVE INTO A HOME AND RE OPEN ON THEY WERE SO BAD THAT THE AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT. THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO GO BACK AND TRY TO FIX PART OF THEM BY ADDING A RIGHT TO KEEP. A RIGHT TO CURE -- FOR FOR THE MERCHANTS [inaudible] SO. YOU KNOW I THAT'S WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL -- AND I'D I'D APPRECIATE CENTER CABALLERO RAISING THOSE POINTS. YOU KNOW I THINK OUR DISTRICTS ARE SIMILAR IN SOME OF THESE RURAL AREAS. THIS GUY DID FALL AND IT DID CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ADA HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LAW THE CHIP SIMPLY EXPANDS THE SAME. THE THE LOS THE LAWSUIT REMAINS THE SAME. AS SENATOR KIRBY -- POINTED OUT YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY THAT UNDER NO. INTENT ILL INTENT. ACCORDING TO TO YOUR BILL. I MEAN THEY COULD AGREE WITH YOU ONE A PERSON ON THE ISSUE BUT THEY'VE. AS CENTER ALLEN POINTED OUT THEY'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO MOVE THESE PRODUCTS. AND THEY BECOME GUILTY UNDER THE SLAB UNDER THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF CURE OR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AND YOU'RE NOT OFFERING A CURE SO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- I I THINK IS THE MAIN PROCESSOR MAIN PROBLEM FOR ME I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY ACTION BECAUSE IT'S A NON GENDER BASED REASON THAT THEY'RE CHARGING A DIFFERENTIAL. AND WOOD AND AGAIN I'D LIKE TO JUST SUGGEST WE WE ALL GO BACK TO THE A. D. A. AND I THINK THAT WE'VE. TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ADA HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRICING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRICING WE NOW WE FEEL WE HAVE -- MADE UNLAWFUL. GENDER BASED PRICING ON SERVICES WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS GUY FALL. WE ARE JUST SIMPLY ADDING TO THAT NO GENDER BASED BASIS -- FOR PRODUCTS AND AS I SAID I I'M SYMPATHETIC TO PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO UNDER BEING ABLE TO BE GIVEN NOTICE OF THIS. I AND I AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK IN DEFERRING THE IMPLEMENTATION SO THE PEOPLE DO GET NOTICE. THIS ISN'T THE GOTCHA KIND OF SITUATION THIS IS JUST SIMPLY WHERE WE ARE TRYING. TO TO CORRECT AN INEQUITY THAT HAS EXISTED FOR FAR TOO LONG LONG AND COST WOMEN. THEY PAY MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE WOMEN THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. WHAT WILL THANK YOU -- BUT MANAGER I'VE BEEN HANDED THE GAVEL SO WE'RE ALL IN TROUBLE ON SO -- I I TOLD YOU EARLIER IVES IN SUPPORT THE BILL ME TO KEEP MY COMMITMENT BUT YOU HAVE A QUESTION QUESTION IS THAT WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES BEEN REYES CONCERNING A D. A. I. GET THAT. ARM IN A RIGHT TO CURE -- WOULD WOULD YOU AT LEAST THINK ABOUT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD A RIGHT TO CURE JUST AS EXISTED ADA SO FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER -- MAY MAY OR MAY NOT BE USING GENDER BASED PRICING THAT THAT IS OFFENSIVE TO TO ALL OF US I THINK -- IF THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO CURE. BOB PERHAPS THEY FIX IT WITHOUT BEING ENGAGE IN LITIGATION SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WHETHER YOU WOULD AT LEAST ENTERTAIN THAT. IS THIS MOVES FORWARD CERTAINLY AS WE AS WE LOOK AT SMALL BUSINESSES WHO WHO ARE I THINK THE CONCERN THAT MOST OF US HAVE. A IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE MANUFACTURER IT'S YOU SO I THINK IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE THE PROPER. NOTICE SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE IN THE NECESSARY ACTION I CERTAINLY WILLING TO CONSIDER THAT BECAUSE OF THIS. WE'RE NOT OUT THERE LOOKING AT THE MOM AND POP STORE WHAT WE WANT TO GET AT IS A CULTURE. OF DISCRIMINATION AND PRICING AND WE USUALLY SEE IT FROM THE BIG FOLKS OUT THERE NOT THE LITTLE PEOPLE AND NOBODY WANTS TO GO AFTER THE LITTLE GUY. A LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. HAPPY TO DO IT. OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS. IS CENTER FOR MONNING MOVES THE BILL. I'M SORRY GOOD I'M FOR MARKET CAN I GET YEAH I CAN GET MS BROWN TO COME BACK UP AND FROM THE OPPOSITION AND CAN YOU MAYBE JUST BREAK YEAH MAYBE JUST BRIEFLY. ADDRESS THE CONCERNS IT'S CENTER CABALLERO AND I HAVE. RAISED. OR YOU KNOW MAYBE HOW YOU WOULD SEE HAVE YOU CAN PAINT A BETTER PICTURE OF HOW OUR ANALOGY. WOULD BE A PROBLEM OF FOR THIS MR. YES THANK YOU -- WITH REGARDS TO THE LITIGATION I THINK THE REASON WHY THE EIGHTY A ISSUE KEEPS BEING RAISED IS BECAUSE IT IS THE EXACT SAME STATUTE THAT IS UTILIZED TO ENFORCE. THE ATA ISSUES IN THE CONSTRUCTION RELATED ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES AND WE HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE EXAMPLES I BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED EFFORTS WITH REGARDS TO REVISING THAT BUT THE MERE FACT. THAT YOU HAVE EASY. ACCESSIBILITY STANDARD ALLEGED VIOLATION OPENS YOU UP THE LITIGATION THAT YOU AND SENATOR CAFIERO RACE WHICH IS YOU GET THE DEMAND LETTER. AND A DEMAND LETTER SAYS YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS ALLEGED VIOLATION AND YOU'RE NOW SUBJECT TO DEALING WITH WHETHER OR NOT YOU PAY FOR A COST OF DEFENSE WAS YOURS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. OR YOU JUST PAY OUT THE MINIMUM STATUTORY DAMAGES WHICH IS FOUR THOUSAND AND I WILL SAY WITH THE GENDER SERVICES -- THE GENDER TAX REPEAL ACT WE HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF LITIGATION WE DECIDED TO SEVERAL OF THE CASES IN OUR LETTER. IN WHICH THE GENDER SERVICES TAX REPEAL ACTED THERE WAS LAWSUITS NOT BY WOMEN BECAUSE A SERVICE WAS PRICE DIFFERENTLY FOR THEM BUT ACTUALLY BY MEN. BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS HIGHER FOR THEM THAN IT WAS FOR THE WOMAN AND THIS BILL ALLOWS EITHER GENDER TO COME FORWARD SO EVEN IF THE WOMAN'S MENSTRUAL. CRAMPS MEDICINE AS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN THE REGULAR ADVIL -- A MAN COULD COME FORWARD AND SAY THAT'S GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND I WOULD LIKE TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAIN AGAINST THE BUSINESS FOR HAVING A LOT HIGHER PRICE FOR MEN'S PRODUCTS. THE GENDER SERVICES TARA TAX REPEAL ACT THERE WAS A AN ATTORNEY WHICH IS REFERENCED DOWN IN THE ANALYSIS DOWN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND THE ATTORNEY WHEN AFTER APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WHO WERE -- BARBERS SALONS AND DRY CLEANERS AND SUED THEM UNDER THE EXISTING STATUTORY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM FOR NOT JUST THE MINIMUM STATUTORY DAMAGES BUT THERE IS AN EXAMPLE IN WHICH EIGHT FEMALE WHO OWNED A DRY CLEANER WAS -- REQUESTED TO DEMAND OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TWENTY CENT DIFFERENCE AND DRY CLEANING. AND YES THAT ATTORNEY WAS ULTIMATELY CONVICTED BUT THE LITIGATION WENT ON FOR ALMOST NINE MONTHS AND THOSE BUSINESSES HAD TO GO THROUGH THE COST OF DEFENSE IN LITIGATION TO PROVE. THAT THEIR PRICE DIFFERENTIALS WERE NOT BASED UPON GENDER BUT THEY'RE A BASED UPON SKILL EFFORT IN TIME THAT COST IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU GET A DEMAND LETTER FOR FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE COST OF DEFENSE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THE PROOF ULTIMATELY THAT IT WASN'T A GENDER BASIS FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL IN PRICE. THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN YOU MADE GENERAL WHAT I MEAN. THIS THANK. SOME OF THE STUFF SOME OF THE STATISTICS ELEVEN REYES BY THE CENTER TROUBLING DOES IT MEAN DOES THIS. DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT THAT THERE IS THIS PRICE DIFFERENTIAL THE AT THAT THAT WOMEN ARE PAYING SO MUCH MORE THAN MEN AND WHAT HOW TO HOW DO YOU RESPOND. WE GONNA ASK HER IN HER CAPACITY WORKING WITH THE CHAMBER OR COOPER CAPACITIES WOMAN ALL OF THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES YOU KNOW I MEAN BOTH THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE CLEAR. ORDER THE STUFF. LOOK I I DON'T HAVE I WILL SAY THIS. IF IT THEY'RE THE EXACT SAME PRODUCTS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THE EXACT SAME WAY THEN I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE REASONING IS FOR THAT BUT I DON'T THINK. THAT THIS BILL DEALS WITH THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT IT DEALS WITH SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND I THINK THERE IS A VARIETY OF REASONS AS TO WHY YOU CAN HAVE A PRICE DIFFERENTIAL. AND I THINK THAT HAVING THAT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WITH THE MINIMUM FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS EXACERBATES THAT PROBLEM OF TRYING TO PROVE WHAT THE GENDER NEUTRAL REASON IT'S I ALSO THERE IS A PART OF ME. THAT BELIEVES THAT I AS A CONSUMER AS A FEMALE CONSUMER CAN MAKE AN INDIVIDUAL DETERMINATION OF WHAT PRODUCT I WANT TO BUY AND IF I WANT THE PAIN PRODUCT AND I WANT TO PAY TWENTY CENTS MORE FOR THE PING PRODUCT. THEN THAT'S MY INDIVIDUAL DETERMINATION AS A CONSUMER AND IF I DON'T WANT TO PAY IT THEN I DON'T WANT TO PAY IT I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT AGAIN AS A POINT BACK EARLIER IF I WAS AT THE POINT OF SALE AT THE REGISTER. AND THE CLERK SAID YOU'RE A WOMAN AND I'M GONNA PAY ARE CHARGING MORE FOR THIS EXACT SAME PRODUCT BECAUSE YOUR WOMEN THAT'S NOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND I HAVE THE CHOICE TO DECIDE WHAT PRODUCT I'M ULTIMATELY GOING TO BUY. THANK YOU CENTER OLOGY HAVE ANYMORE QUESTIONS -- I I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I WASN'T PLANNING ON ON SPEAKING ON ON THIS. BUT I WAS TRYING. TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO YOU? CREATE THAT APPLE TO APPLE COMPARISON. IN YEARS MENTIONED -- WHAT YOU JUST WENT -- THAT DIFFICULTY. THE EXTERNALITIES IN THE MARKETPLACE ARE SO VARIED AND COMPLEX. I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN. FINDING THAT APPLE TO APPLE. UNLESS THEY'RE FROM THE SAME MANUFACTURER. WITH THE SAME DIES WITH THE SAME. OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS SEES. EVER. AND THEN THE SAME ADVERTISING BUDGET THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU JUST CAN'T. IN CAPSULE EIGHT EASILY. AND DOES IT FRUSTRATE ME WHEN I GO TO SUPERCUTS FOR MY FIFTEEN DOLLAR HAIR CUT AND MY WIFE GOES. TO ONE THAT I THINK IS EQUALLY COMPETENT AND SHE GETS CHARGED EIGHTY TWO I THINK THAT'S FAIR. ABSOLUTELY NOT. DO I THINK THAT MY WIFE HAS A CHOICE NOT TO TO BLOW EIGHTY DOLLARS ON A SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR HAIR CUT IF YOU WILL -- THAT'S CONSUMER WISDOM. AND YOU CAN'T REGULATE OR LEGISLATE STUPID. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE'RE ASKING OURSELVES HERE WE ARE TRYING. TO TO CREATE A PROBLEM WHICH IS INDEED I THINK REAL. BUT THE MECHANISM BY WHICH WE WOULD GO. IN THE LAKES TO WHICH WE WOULD GO TO MODIFY IT AND CHANGE THAT. WOULD BE SO ONEROUS. AND I THINK CREDIBILITY WOULD BE ENHANCE AND ALSO ALL AND OPPOSE THIS TO CENTER JACKSON. WOULD YOU CONSIDER. YES THERE IS A I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME TO SUPERCUTS EXT I BY THE WAY. WOULD YOU CONSIDER. AMENDING -- YOUR ITEM. TO TAKE AWAY THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN INSTEAD MAYBE EVEN PUT THIS INTO THE CONSUMER -- PART CENTER TO CONSUMER PROTECTION. REGULATORY SCHEME YOU KNOW I'M NOT PREPARED TO UNDERMINE THE EN ROUTE CIVIL RIGHTS ACTED THIS POINT I AM MORE THAN HAPPY. TO TO TALK APPLES TO APPLES AND APPLES TO APPLES ARE -- SERVICES IN GOOD STEAD ARE BASED ON GENDER -- I BELIEVE AT TWO TWO NINE NEUTER. TO NEUTER PEOPLE'S RIGHTS -- BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO BAD APPLES AND THAT'S IT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS GUY IN RIVERSIDE. THIS KIND RIVERSIDE HAS GONE TO PRISON FOR WHAT HE'S DONE DOES THAT MEAN THAT ALL WOMEN SHOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR PRODUCTS. BECAUSE THERE'S ONE CREEP DOWN IN RIVERSIDE THAT WE'VE NOW PUT IN PRISON IS ABOUT TO LOSE HIS BAR CARD. IT WE SHOULD WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE THERE'S ONE BAD APPLE THERE OR CAN WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING THAT MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE GET NOTICE. I GET IT CENTER CAFIERO THERE ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE OUT THERE BUT ALSO TO REVERT TO REFER A CONSUMER WISDOM VERSUS STUPID FRANKLY IS AN INSULT TO WOMEN. WE WE DON'T SPEND ALL DAY LONG WALKING AROUND THE STORE TO COMPARE PRICES BECAUSE USUALLY WE GOT A BABY OR TWO ONE HAND OR WEAR COME RUNNING HOME FROM WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE DINNER. AND HAD TO STAY LATE AT THE OFFICE AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THE KIDS TO WILL LESSEN I MEAN. YOU KNOW THIS THIS KIND OF THING. IS IT IS JUST DENYING THE REALITY OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN IT YOU DECIDE YOU WANT A FIFTEEN DOLLAR SUPER CUT THAT'S GREAT YOUR WIFE SAYS I WANT TO GO TO A HAIRDRESSER. BUT DOES HAVE HAIR DRESSER SPENT HALF AN HOUR WITH HER CHARGER EIGHTY DOLLARS AND CHARGE HALF AN HOUR WITH SOME -- SOME GUY IN CHARGE OF TEN BECAUSE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE COMPARISON IT AND IN OUR BILL HERE WE HAVE UNDER THE MARKUP AMENDMENTS. NO BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER MAY DISCRIMINATE WITH THE PRICE -- CHARGE FOR GOODS OF ANY TO CONSUMER PRODUCTS FROM THE SAME MANUFACTURER. THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR IF SUCH PRODUCTS A PRICE DIFFERENTLY SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE MARKET PLACE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ISOLATE. THE KIND OF DISCRIMINATION THAT WE SEE AN AS EXISTED FOR YEARS BASED ON GENDER AND TO CALL WOMEN'S TOO BUT I HOPE YOU DIDN'T MEAN THAT BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW. THE PRODUCTS ARE PLACED IN DIFFERENT PLACES FOR A REASON SMART MARKETERS WILL DO THAT BUT THEY'RE STILL CHARGING WOMEN MORE AND WOMEN ARE STILL. PAYING A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE A EAR IT EVERY WOMAN IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF THAT KIND OF DISPARITY OKAY SO THAT DISCRIMINATION ME AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE QUESTION. I ASKED IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER -- THE THE THEIR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE IT THE END GOAL OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE TAURUS I THINK IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE SITUATIONS AS DISPARATE. IN OBVIOUS AS THE EXAMPLES WE'VE HEARD. IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE POLICY COULD NOT BE AFFECTED WITHOUT A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION INSTEAD MAKE IT A CONSUMER PROTECTION. WELL UNDER PRESSURE THE PROBLEM IS UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION AND I KNOW CENTER COPIER ON THOSE AS WELL WE HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT ABILITIES TO ENFORCE AND IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THAT ENFORCEMENT AGENCY NOTHING HAPPENS. AND THAT'S BEEN PART OF THE PROBLEM ON ISSUES. LAW SUCH AS THIS THERE IS NO HAMMER THERE. TO TO REQUIRE ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A STRONG ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM NOW. AM I WILLING TO TALK ABOUT A WAY SO THAT WE HAVE A STRONG ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM BUT WE DON'T CATCH IN THAT WAY OF SMALL BUSINESSES ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO DO THAT. WE WILL. I CAN REMIND THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE A MOTION -- ON THE DíAS AND AT I THINK WE'RE KIND OF MOVE AROUND IN CIRCLES NOW I POINT POINT POINT TAKEN -- BUT I I DO HAVE A ANOTHER ANOTHER ANOTHER QUESTION. THE IDEA THOUGH. THE IDEA THOUGH IS THAT IF I DON'T WANT TO IN RICH I DON'T WANT TO IN RICH. ATTORNEYS -- BUT I THINK THE END GOAL IS THAT THERE IS SOME DISPARITY BUT YOU CAN'T QUANTIFY. AND YOU CAN'T. CREATE ENOUGH APPLES APPLES IN LEAST IN MY OPINION IN WAYS THAT WOULD -- ALLOW THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT SENATE CENTER COVER EURO HAD TALKED ABOUT -- IT INSTEAD ONLY GOING AFTER THE LARGE ONES I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MAKE THIS WORK -- UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I'M GONNA TAKE THE ADVICE OF MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE CENTER JONES WANTS TO GO EAT -- HE'S TIRED OF BEATING COMMITTEE. YOUR IDEAL IS GETTING COLD -- ANY OTHER -- MEMBER WISHING TO SAY ANYTHING. I BELIEVE SENATOR MINIG HAS A BILL ON THE FLOOR -- FOLKS IN HERE A MOTION IT IS GETTING LATE. IT IS A MOTION -- TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FLOOR -- WITHOUT OBJECTION I WILL ASK THE COMMITTEE SECRETARY TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AFTER. AFTER SHE GIVES A CLOSING STATEMENT. THANK YOU VERY BRIEFLY ARE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY THIS LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION IT'S ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA WOMAN -- AS CERTAINLY MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BILL BUT IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE THIS DISCRIMINATION WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ADDRESS IT. I'M HAPPY TO WORKMEN'S PEREIRA. WE'VE WORKED VERY WELL TOGETHER WE DON'T WE NEVER START OFF IN THE FROM THE SAME PLACE -- BUT I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY -- TO TRY TO COME TO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO RESOLVE THIS -- PROBLEM CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WORK ON SENATOR COMING YEAR OLDS CONCERNS WHICH WE WHICH WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE AGAIN THE GOAL ISN'T TO GOTCHA THE GOAL IS TO FIX THE PROBLEM. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ALL RIGHT CENTER MONEY HAS THE MOTION ON THE FLOOR TO PASS AMENDED COMMITTEE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
