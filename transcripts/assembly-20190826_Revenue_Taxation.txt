WHEN YOU CALL THE ROLL BURKE HERE RALPH HERE CHU GRAY MANSE MELENDEZ. MULLIN PETRIE-NORRIS. QUIRK HERE RIVAS. TING WE HAVE A QUORUM. THE CORN NO WAY FRONT AUTHOR. I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED. THE STAFF. YEAH OKAY. RIGHT THERE IS. YEAH. SOMEONE YEAH ALSO AND ME TO FILE ITEM ONE AS HE TO NINETY FIVE SENATOR IN CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH MAN CHAIR. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WOMAN INTO THE COMMITTEE AN APOLOGY I'M SORRY ABOUT BEING LATE. TRYING TO BE A TO GET OFF THE FLOOR SO I'M JUST AND SO APPRECIATIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. FIRST I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT THANK YOU FOR THE CHAIR AND HER INCREDIBLE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. THE PAST TWO DECADES HAVE SEEN A MARKED INCREASE A WILDFIRE SEVERITY. THE TWO THOUSAND A WILDFIRE SEASON ECLIPSED AS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY THIS YEAR FOR WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA AND CANDIDLY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY WILD AND FIRES ABOUT TAKING PLACE IN THE LAST DECADE. WITH OVER THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES AND OTHER STRUCTURES BEING DESTROYED BY WILDFIRES SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AS A TWO THOUSAND TEN CALIFORNIA AT FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES IN THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE. TOO MANY TWO MILLION OF THOSE ARE AT A HIGH OR EXTREME RISK FROM WILDFIRES. THAT'S ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ANALYSIS BY THERE'S A DATA AND KNOWLEDGE ANALYTICS FIRM. SOME OF THE MOST EXPOSED COUNTIES ARE ALSO THOSE WITH THE LEAST OF ME. INCLUDING MANY RURAL COUNTIES AND CANDIDLY HAVE SEEN THAT FIRSTHAND MY OWN BACKYARD. BOTH URBAN AND SUBURBAN COUNTIES ALSO FACE SIGNIFICANT RISK AND THIS IS WHERE THE BULK OF THE THREATEN HOMES CURRENTLY EXIST. FITS TO FIRE HARD HOMES CAN COST AS MUCH AS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PUTTING COMMONSENSE MITIGATION MEASURES OUT OF REACH FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT SOME KIND OF STATE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. AND FUNNY MITIGATION MAKES FISCAL SENSE. THE FEMA ESTIMATES THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON FIRE HARDING MEASURES TO BRING BUILDINGS UP TO CURRENT CODES FOR DOLLARS RECEIVED AND THAT INCLUDES COUNTLESS LIVES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTY DAMAGE AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF AVOID INSURANCE COSTS. IN CALIFORNIA THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT CAN APPROACH SIX DOLLARS SIX DOLLARS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF MITIGATION. WE'RE MODELING THIS BILL OFF OF THE VERY SUCCESSFUL BID LÃ  IN COLORADO THEY PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT ALLOWS HOMEOWNERS TO CLAIM A DEDUCTION OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT EXPENSES. HOPING LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF HOMEOWNERS MAINTAIN DEFENSIBLE SPACE SINCE THE BILL WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCE. THE BILL CREATED TO TAX CREDIT SYSTEM FOR QUALIFY TAXPAYERS WHO IN KERR COSTS WHILE PERFORMING HOME HARDENING OR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ON THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDITS ANY HOME HARDENING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT MUST COMPLY WITH STATE BUILDING CODES AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS FOR AREAS VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRE. ENSURING THAT THESE MEASURES ARE BACKED BY DATA. TAXPAYERS CAN GET REIMBURSED. 450% OF THE COST OF THE ANCHOR TO IMPLEMENT THESE MEASURES. OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR HOME HARDENING MEASURES IN A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE NATION MANAGEMENT. WE WILL ALSO BE AMENDING THE BILL TO LOWER THE INCOME THRESHOLD TO SEVENTY THOU SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR INDIVIDUAL IN FORTY THOUSAND A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR JOINT FILERS IF. THIS BILL MAKES IT OUT OF COMMITTEE IN INTO PREPARATIONS. TO FURTHER SAFEGUARD TAXPAYERS SB TWO NINETY FIVE INCLUDES RIGOROUS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IT COMPLIES WITH BEST PRACTICES FOR TAX EXPENDITURES BY OUTLINES SPECIFIC GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. IT REQUIRES A LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE REVIEW THE TAX CREDIT INTO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT INCLUDES A SUNSET PROVISION WHICH I THINK IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE REVIEWS A TAX CREDIT. IN FIVE YEARS AND I WANTED MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHAIR WHO IS BEEN SO FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE DELIVERING DELIVERED. ON THE MONEY THAT WE'RE INVESTING WHEN IT COMES TO. TAX CREDITS. THANK YOU SO MUCH HAVE ME HAVE WITH US TODAY PAUL SMITH FROM RC RC AND THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND FROM SOUTH LAKE TAHOE FIRE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS CHIEF MET SEN HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE FEEL THAT THIS ISSUE IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND IF YOU IF YOU'LL LET ME DIGRESS JUST A BABY BIT. I'VE HAD EXPERIENCES IS THE FIRST SHE PARTICULAR WHEN I WAS IN MARIN COUNTY WHERE WE- TRY TO GET HOMEOWNERS TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES. AND TO CUT THEIR WEEKS. AND THE REALITY IS THAT THAT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TASK TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED AND ULTIMATELY WE TOOK HIM THROUGH LITIGATION PROCESS IT TOOK US NEARLY TWO YEARS. I TO GET ANYTHING DONE AND THEN WE HAVE STARTED THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. SO THE INCENTIVE CONCERTS CONCEPT ABOUT DO YOU GET PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH. DO YOU CATCH BEES WITH HONEY. CATCHING WITH VINEGAR REALLY IS KIND OF APPROPRIATE IN THIS AREA. IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF YOU HARDEN YOUR HOME AND YOU. TAKE CARE OF YOUR FUEL MANAGEMENT. I YOU'RE PROTECTING YOUR NEIGHBORS HOMES AS WELL WE LOOK AT THESE LARGE URBAN CONFLAGRATIONS CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY AT THE LEADER AND THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT VERY PROUD OF. WE SHOULD BE THE LEADER AND WHILE FIRE. AND WE SHOULD BE THE LEADERS IN MITIGATION SO. I WOULD URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS INCENTIVES WORK FOR PEOPLE. IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO HARD YOUR HOME AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE. JUST DON'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT WE THINK THIS MAKES SENSE. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS PAUL SMITH WITH RC RC ALSO KNOWN AS THE RURAL COUNTIES ASSOCIATION AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW MOST OF OUR MEMBER COUNTIES ARE GROUND ZERO FOR THE WILD FIRE PROBLEM. THE WELFARE DEBATE AND PARTICULARLY THE WILDFIRES STRUCTURE LOSS. PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CAMPFIRE AND BUTTE CAR FIRE AND SHASTA THE NUMEROUS FIRES IN LEE COUNTY THAT CENTER REQUIRES EXPERIENCE IN RECENT YEARS. THESE HAVE ALL BEEN COUNTIES WITH INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE LOSS. WE BELIEVE THE ONE OF THE BUSINESS BIGGEST TOOLS WE CAN HAVE IT TO MINIMIZE STRUCTURE LOST IS DEFENSIBLE SPACE HOME HARDENING. MANY OF OUR COUNTIES ARE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF NOT ONLY ADOPTING DEFENSIBLE SPACE ORDINANCES BUT AND FORCING THEM I THINK IS THE CHIEF BIG EXPLAIN JUST A MOMENT AGO JUST HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS. SO WE SEE SB TWO NINETY FIVE IS AN APPROPRIATE TOOL TO GET SOME FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR. THOSE INDIVIDUALS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF LOWER INCOME. AND DO NOT HAVE OBVIOUSLY THE CASH FLOW OR THE UP FRONT MONIES TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK WE SEE THIS BILL AS A VERY KEY PART OF THAT CONVERSATION. AND AGAIN. AND MANY OF OUR MEMBER COUNTIES THE INCOME LEVEL IS JUST SO DIFFICULT AND THIS IS WHY AGAIN THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TOOL WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASSES AND QUITE FRANKLY THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THIS. ONE OF THE KEY ASPECTS OF. MITIGATING THE WHILE FIRED THREAT THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON LARGER MEMO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA. OF CERTAIN THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION I DO WANT TO SAY WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE WITH THE MANY ASPECTS THAT ARE PUT INTO THE MEASURE REGARDING SEND SIX SIX CETERA THAT WE'VE BEEN ADDED VACATING FOR WHILE ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR PAYING AT PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH DO APPRECIATE IT THE REASON WE SUPPORT DON'T SUPPORT THE MEASURE IS THAT IT WOULD POTENTIALLY CUT UP TO ONE POINT TWO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR SCHOOLS.MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO KIDS THE NEXT THREE YEARS SO WE DO VERY MUCH TO BELIEVE SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE IF IT'S THE PRIORITY ON THAT THIS LEGISLATURE BELIEVES THAT IT IS THEN WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT OTHER TAX CREDITS OR OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THAT MIGHT NOT GIVE YOU THE SAME RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN THE SAME BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE AND WE WOULD ASK YOU TO USE AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF FUNDING. FOR AN EXAMPLE THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE IN HIGH HIGH PRONE FIRE AREAS OF AS WELL I SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME THIS YEAR ADVOCATING TO GET IT A THIRD YOU. ARE EIGHTY A FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS IN PARADISE. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME ON THAT AND WE THINK THEY EVEN THE THREE YEARS ISN'T GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR PARADISE TO. BUILD BECAUSE THEY CAN EVEN REBUILD OUR SCHOOLS COMPREHENSIVELY. UNTIL IT COUNTY KIDS ALL THE MYRIAD OF FOUNDATIONAL SUPPORTS AND SERVICES TAKING CARE OF SO WE IN THE- SCHOOL SYSTEM ARE ALSO. HAVING TO SUFFER FROM THE RESULT OF WILDFIRES BUT WE BELIEVE THAT TAKING RESOURCES AWAY FROM SCHOOLS. THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY. PROVIDE SERVICES TO KIDS AND BUILD OUR OWN-FACILITIES SO WE CAN WITHSTAND FIRE OR ALSO ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO. WITH THIS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE AND WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT BUT WE DO ASK THAT SCHOOLS ARE NOT HARMED IN THE PROCESS OF THESE LONG TERM SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE TALKED QUIRK. SO I HAVE A COUPLE PROBLEMS ONE IS. AT LEAST AT THE TIME OF THE WRITING OF THE ANALYSIS IN THE MAY HAVE CHANGED IT'S NOT A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT WHICH MEANS THE 50% OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE WHO DON'T PAY STATE TAXES GET NO BENEFIT. THESE ARE ALSO LOWER INCOME. AND I REALIZE THIS WOULD ALSO MAKE THE BILL MORE EXPENSIVE BUT PERHAPS YOU HAVE TO THEN LOWER THE. THREE INCOME LEVELS IT WHICH YOU TOGETHER BENEFIT BUT FRANKLY THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY STATE TAXES ARE BECAUSE OF BEING OF LOW INCOME AND THESE ARE THE ONES WHO NEED THE HELP THE MOST DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THAT ANY REFLECTIONS ON WHAT YOU MIGHT DO. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH AS AN EVER AT THROUGH THE CHAIR AT SOME MEMBER QUIRK BRINGS UP A REALLY GOOD POINT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LOW INCOME OR ON FIXED INCOME IS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE MIDDLE CLASS. WE DID NOT FOCUS ON THE LOW INCOME OR THOSE SENIORS WHO ARE ON FIXED INCOME TWO REASONS ONE ASSUME NUMBER WOULD HAS A REALLY GREAT BILL THAT IS HAS CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IT'S A ONE BILLION DOLLAR REVOLVING LOAN FUND THAT WOULD BE FOCUS ON THOSE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS THAT ARE LIVING WITHIN. HI FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY SOUNDS. SENATOR RUBIO ALSO HAS A MEASURE THAT'S BEEN FOCUS ON LOW INCOME AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON FIXED INCOMES. THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS BETWEEN SEVENTY THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND YEAR WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND OR CENTER RUBIO IS LEGISLATION. AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THE MAJORITY OF HOMES WITH IN THAT HI FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNS THOSE VERY ZONES OUR MIDDLE INCOME. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ADVANCING THE TAX CREDIT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THIS HAS TO BE PART OF A LARGER PICTURE. AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE ADDITIONAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION ON TO WEATHER FRONTS. NUMBER ONE WE NEED TO TAKE A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH ABOUT HOW WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS WHETHER IT'S THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND IS A MEMBER WOOD OR TAX CREDIT WHICH MEANS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE IS GETTING. THE DATE EVERY YEAR ON NON RENEWALS. THEY DON'T INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T. DON'T CURRENTLY. HAVE A MANDATE TO BE TO PROVIDE THE NON RENEWAL INFORMATION ON ANNUAL BASIS TO THE PART INSURANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT HAS TO BE A MUST. THAT WAY WE'RE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH AREAS OF THE STATE. ARE LOSING INSURANCE THE FASTEST. THEN YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE REVOLVING LOAN FUND AND TAX CREDITS TO BE TO TAKE CARE NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITY. DOING ONE HOUSE AT IT I WILL NOT MAKE OF COMMUNITY MORE FIRE SAFE IT'S TAKING ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY. AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITH DATA WHICH WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE. IN ADDITION YOU'RE GONNA SEE LEGISLATION THAT WILL BE AN- THAT FOCUS ON TRUNCATING THE TIME. FOR CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHEN IT COMES A FIRE SAFETY AND PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PROPERTY. I'M IT COULD BE SIX MONTHS TO TWO YEARS TO BE A TO MITIGATE A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY. WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE RISK THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WE ALSO NEED TO GET CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND FIRE MARSHALS. THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT SOME SUGAR ON THE TABLE TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE FIRE STATE. SO THAT IS WHY. WE DID NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE SPACE OF THE SIM NUMBER WOULDN'T BECAUSE HE HAS A WONDERFUL PLAN. AND WE FULLY SUPPORT THAT. AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW THERE ARE GOING TO BE LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES THAT WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THAT REVOLVING LOAN FUND. AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE S. FOCUSING ON THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALSO NEARING IT DOWN. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE ISSUE OF LOCKS TAX REVENUE. I'LL SAY IS THAT. THE CITY AND ROSA CITY SCHOOLS. I THEY'VE LOST SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS SEVEN HUNDRED AND OVER THREE THOUSAND FOLKS OF LESSON ON THE COUNTY. OVER THE LAST NEARLY TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. WE HAVE FOUGHT HARD TO BE ABLE TO BACKFILL THEIR GENERAL FUND. WE TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE LONGEST AND LARGEST LOSSES OF TO OF PROPERTY TAX IT'S WHEN THESE MASSIVE FIRES WIPE OUT ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS IN ROLES. IN NASSAU WERE SEEN SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY TAX. REDUCTIONS IT'S GOING TO TAKE A GENERATION IN CINEMA COUNTY TO BE A TO GET BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE IN THE CITY SANTA ROSA IT MAY TAKE LONGER. IN THE COUNTY OF LAKE AND THE REASON WHY I BRING THAT UP IS THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO BE A TO BRING THIS FORWARD WE NEED A STRATEGIC APPROACH. MULTIPLE TOOLS IN THE BELT AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND IF WE CAN GIVE OVER TEN. BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS TO CORPORATIONS IN THE STATE WE SURE AS HELL CAN GIVE IT TO HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS TO BE TO MAKE THEIR FOR THEIR HOMES FIRE SAFE I'M SORRY YEP DON SOME NUMBER OF BUT IT. IS A GREAT QUESTION REALLY THERE WAS. A GOOD ANSWER. MY CONCERN IS. THE WAY THAT IS HIGH PRAISE FROM HIM YEAH. MY CONCERN IS NOW WE'RE SAYING IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME TO GET A LOAN IF YOU HAVE. HIGH INCOME YOU GET FREE MONEY. AND THAT JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. YOU'RE TREATING THE HIGHER INCOME PEOPLE BETTER THAN YOUR TREATING THE LOWER INCOME PEOPLE. THAT'S MY CONCERN. I MEAN WE COULD DEVELOP A LARGER LOAN PROGRAM BUT I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE THE EXPENSE OF THAT AN IMPACT ON THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT BUT AGAIN IF THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO STEP UP AND STAND TALL FOR THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS ON THE PLANET. AND GIVE THEM TAX BREAKS THEN WE BETTER IS HELD STEP UP AND PROVIDE THEM FOR HOMEOWNERS IN IN THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE CAN INSURE FIRE SAFETY BUT I HEAR YOU AND I RESPECT YOUR OPINION AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE SMARTEST. INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW WE MAY DISAGREE ON THIS BUT YEAH I GREATLY RESPECT YOUR OPINION. THANK YOU. MR GRAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR AGENCY. THE BILL THAT YOU BROUGHT HERE TODAY AND MY COMMENTS ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE OF FORCE OF THAT I THINK MAKES A GREAT DEAL OF SENSE TO GIVE SOME INCENTIVES TO HARDEN AND REDUCE SOME OF THIS RISK ON THE MACRO LEVEL I'M WELL AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTY AS RELATIONSHIP AND SAYS I HAVE A PROPERTY WITH MY FAMILY IN THE FOOTHILLS OF PREMIER POSER REGION AND WE'VE SEEN OUR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE GO FROM ROUGHLY FOURTEEN HER DOLLARS YEAR FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR IN ONE YEAR. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND GOING FORWARD BUT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SUCH CALIFORNIA AND NORTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE SAID WITH ALMOST EVERYONE OF THESE BILLS BEFORE EVERY COMMITTEE AND ON THE FLOOR IS THERE SEEMS. TO BE OR FEELS AS IF THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A. FOR CALLING PARKS EITHER PERHAPS SAY. A SENSE THAT WE'RE GOING TO IGNORE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF OTHER STATES WE HAVE FOLKS THAT REPRESENT DISTRICTS WHERE CLIMATE CHANGE IS CREATING PERHAPS A PROPENSITY FOR INCREASES IN FIRE RISK WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS HOW DO WE PROVIDE SOME BLANKET SECURITY. WALT HOMES OR COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WE HAVE INCREASINGLY HOT CLIMATES. HISTORICALLY WE'VE ALWAYS HAD OUR CLIMATE JUST AS HISTORICALLY PORTIONS YOUR DISTRICT ANOTHER HAVE ALWAYS HAD WILD FIRES. AND AS WE SEE INCREASES IN BOTH IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ENERGY RATE INCREASES ON MY CONSTITUENTS. SO IT'S LIKE SHARING IS CARING WHEN IT COMES TO WILD FIRES. AND LET'S SPREAD THE RISK AND THAT'S ALL PAY AND LET'S ALL HELP OUT. BUT MEANWHILE THE PARADE A BILL WHICH WAS A RATE YOU KNOW. RESTRUCTURING BILL FROM TWENTY. THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN STILL HASN'T BEEN ABLE IMPLEMENTED WERE TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE INCREASINGLY SEE. SIGNIFICANT HIKES IN ENERGY RATES AND TIERED RATE STRUCTURES FOR FOLKS IN THE CENTER ALLEN OTHER HOT CLIMATE SO WHAT WHILE I'M SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT EFFORTS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE TOOLS AND THE SUPPORT FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS I WOULD HOPE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD YOURSELF. MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BEGIN TO HAVE SOME EQUAL CAN EARN AN ATTENTION. TO THE VERY REAL ISSUE THEY SAID. SOME OF THE POOREST COMMUNITIES. IN THE STATE WHICH RESIDE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SUPPORT TODAY AND CERTAINLY LOOK TO SUPPORT IT AS IT MOVES FORWARD BUT WOULD ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN ELEVATING AND REYES IN THOSE ISSUES TO OUR COLLEAGUES. THE TERM WHICH WOULD BE OKAY. LOOK AT THE SOMEONE NUMBER BRINGS UP REALLY GOOD POINTS. BEING FULLY TRANSPARENT WE'VE BEEN ASKED IF WE COULD EXPAND THIS INCLUDING BOLTING OF HOMES FOR EARTHQUAKES. I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TALK WITH YOU MORE ABOUT THIS IF THAT WOULD BE OKAY AND WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO SET SOME TIME ON AT SOME OF YOUR IDEAS I THINK ON THIS ISSUE THIS CAN BE COMPLETELY CANDID WITH A COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR. I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IS LOOK AT A PILOT PROJECT THAT COULD BE ADVANCE IN THIS STATE THAT CAN BE FOCUSED ON WILDFIRE MULTIPLE TOOLS IN THE BALLOT AS WE JUST DISCUSSED THIS IN THE REPORT. AND. SOME OF OUR GREAT YOU BRING UP SOME WONDERFUL POINTS THAT IT GOES WELL BEYOND. WILDFIRES IN THOSE ISSUES EXIST PRIOR TO THIS CRISIS IN THE STATE I WOULD. BE WILLING TO IN MORE THAN WILLING IN IN HELP YOU BE WILLING TO SIT DOWN. AND TALK FURTHER ABOUT THAT IF THAT BE OKAY. ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE IT AND YEAH I THINK THAT WE MAY FIND THE ANSWER TO ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS IN WORKING TOGETHER. ON A LARGER SCALE THAT'S NOT FOR TODAY'S COMMITTEE HEARING BUT CERTAINLY. SOME WE SHOULD SIT DOWN TALK ABOUT. YOU'LL HEAR FROM US THANK YOU SO MUCH SIMILAR I'M GRATEFUL. THANK YOU. SO IN MEMORY OF US DID YOU. THANK YOU. ARE YOU TO JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THE CREEK FIRE. HAPPEN IN MY DISTRICT AND OUR COMMUNITY IS STILL. ON RECOVERING FROM THIS FIRE AND I'VE HEARD FROM MY CONSTITUENTS. ABOUT THIS SO I THINK THIS IS. THE HOME HARDENING AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ARE GREAT WAYS. TO HELP. ALL OF THE- VICTIMS OF THESE WILDFIRES AND TO PREVENT. HOMES FROM. BEING BURNED. AND AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT THAT FIRE WAS GOING ON I KNOW THERE WAS A- FIRE IN. IN YOUR DISTRICT SENATOR. AND RUMOR HAS IT THAT WHEN YOU HEARD THAT. HOME OF A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL. WAS BURNING YOU PERSONALLY WHEN IN. I'M TO SAVE SOME MEMENTOS. ON FOR THAT PERSON SO I WHEN I COMMEND YOU. FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO THIS ISSUE. SO THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT WAS A- HELL OF A NIGHT I WILL SHARE TIA AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL THANK YOU. NUMBER TING. THANK YOU SIR FOR THE BILL JUST. STERN IN TERMS OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REGARDING THE TAX CREDIT OBVIOUSLY WEEK THIS IS IN A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WE DEFINITELY DO WANT PEOPLE TO DO BETTER IN TERMS OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT MAKING SURE THERE ARE HOMES ARE FIRE RESISTANT ON THE ANALYSIS PLAY NOT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY REALLY. INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR OR WE JUST GIVING MONEY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO ALREADY DO THIS ANYWAYS CITY OF THE SENSOR DIFFERENT GIVE ANY KIND OF. STUDY OR ANY DATA THAT THAT WHAT'S MOVE US IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER NIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER TING WHAT I CAN I CAN'T SHARE WITH YOU DATA ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL BUT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU DATA WITH IN CINEMA MENDOCINO LAKE COUNTIES. WHILE THERE IS A MANDATE FOR HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE. TO ADVANCE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AS WELL AS HOME HARDENING. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT ESPECIALLY. THROUGHOUT THE FIELD AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF MEANS. SO I REPLACE IN A ROOF IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND BEING ABLE TO PUT A MANDATE ON TO THEM AS A CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL ESPECIALLY THE BACKLOG. IS SIMPLY AREN'T MOVING ON THAT. SO THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THIS NEED TO BE PART OF A LARGER PROGRAM NUMBER ONE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET. MANDATED DATA TO THE APARTMENT INSURANCE FOR NON RENEWALS. TWO WE NEED TO BE A LOOK AT THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE GREATEST NUMBER OF NON RENEWALS WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GO OFF OF WHERE INSURANCE BEING LOSS IS GOING TO FOR FAIR PLAN NUMBERS. THREE WE NEED A- BONE FORSMAN OFFICERS. WITH AN EXPEDITED TIMELINE S WE JUST HEARD FROM THE CHIEF COULD PAY TAKE TWO YEARS. TO GET AN INDIVIDUAL TO THE PROCESS. TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THE LAW. I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT NINETY DAYS THAT'S GONNA BE CONTROVERSIAL. AND THOSE CONE FORCING OFFICERS RATHER THAN JUST THROWING. A HAMMER IT FOLKS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TOOLS. AND THAT'S WHERE WE BRING. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOME NUMBER WOODS INVOLVING LONG FINE. FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOW INCOME ON FIXED. INCOME AND THERE IS A REBATE PROGRAM IN THAT FOR THE THOSE OR THE LOWEST OF LOW INCOME. AS WELL AS HELP THOSE WERE MIDDLE CLASS. I WILL WORK AS A MEMBER TING ON STATEWIDE NUMBERS I DON'T HAVE THAT ON ME TODAY AND I DON'T WANT TO. BE SCA HEARING COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. SEEING AND I AND I TO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL I DO THINK THAT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE HARDENED AND I THINK IN COMPLEMENT WITH SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS WHICH WE DID REVIEW AS PART OF REVIEWING YOUR MEASURE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE OF ALL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS ARE ABLE TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES AND TO THE OPPOSITION IN THIS ONE CASE I WILL I WILL ACTUALLY I FEEL DIFFERENTLY ON THIS ONE I WENT TO SCHOOL IN PARADISE THERE WAS ACTUALLY SAVED AS A RESULT OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND HARDENING AND THAT SCHOOL IN THOSE STUDENTS. IT'S THE ONE NORMAL THING THEY HAVE BECAUSE THE PROPERTY WAS HARDENED AND BECAUSE VEGETATION MANAGER WAS DONE THEY GET TO STILL GO TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND IT'S THE ONE THING THAT THEY HAVE TO RETURN TO REGULARLY AND THAT WAS FROM THEIR PREVIOUS LIFE AND I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. NOT JUST THE HOMES ARE HARDENED BUT THAT ALL THE IMPORTANT PROPERTIES IN THE COMMUNITY OUR OUR OUR CAT MAINTAINED AND KEPT SAFE AND WHETHER THAT'S A HOSPITAL OR A SCHOOL I AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED TO EXTEND THESE PROGRAMS TO THOSE FOLKS AS WELL BUT I THINK THAT THE DAMAGE AND THE LOSS FROM PROPERTY TAXES FROM. DEVASTATING THESE COMMUNITIES I DEFINITELY SAW THAT AS WELL AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE LOCALS AND SO FOR ME THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE MAKING SURE YOU COMMUNITIES ARE HARDENED IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NEEDS MEANS. ANY CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY OF. THIS LEGISLATURE WITH THAT. YOU HAVE IN IRAQ WHICH LEFT. HMM THANK YOU FOR WORKING. AS PLEASE IT IS AN ABSOLUTE. PLEASURE AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE I'M IN FRONT OF YOU. SEARCH FOR. VERY GRATEFUL AND WOULD APPRECIATE YOU KNOW I. THINK YOU WITH THAT MISSILE WOULD CALL THE ROLL.
