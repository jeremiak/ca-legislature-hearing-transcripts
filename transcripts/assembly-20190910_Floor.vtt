01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:26.759
BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:28.728
TO SELL FIREARMS DEPENDING ON

01:59:28.794 --> 01:59:29.829
THE TYPE OF FIREARM BEING

TRANSACTED IN SOME INSTANCES

01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:33.566
THIS MAY EXEMPT FOR EXAMPLE

FIRE ARM. THE DISPARATE

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:43.743
TREATMENT CAUSES CONFUSION AND

01:59:43.809 --> 01:59:44.510
MAKES UNCLEAR IF AND WHEN

WELL AS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:59:53.219 --> 01:59:54.353
BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF

01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:56.055
CLARITY. THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:59:56.122 --> 01:59:57.290

A SINGLE LIMIT FOR THE NUMBER

KIND OF DISCRIMINATION IN

CALIFORNIA AND WE SHOULD ALLOW

THIS KIND OF DISCRIMINATION IN

04:57:31.733 --> 04:57:34.002

LESS ALL WERE SIMPLY ASKING

04:57:58.827 --> 04:57:59.828
THEM TO DO IS TO GIVE EVERY

CALIFONE BORN IN. A FAIR SHOT

04:58:02.231 --> 04:58:03.565
AT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AT A

04:58:03.632 --> 04:58:05.667
PRICE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD.

04:58:05.734 --> 04:58:07.169
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST SOMEONE

04:58:07.236 --> 04:58:07.803
ON THE BASIS OF THEIR

04:58:07.869 --> 04:58:09.238

KEEP PEOPLE SHELTERED IS NOT

04:58:12.708 --> 04:58:14.309
ONLY UNCONSCIONABLE BUT IT'S

04:58:14.376 --> 04:58:16.111
ILLOGICAL IN A STATE WITH THE

04:58:16.178 --> 04:58:17.546
AMOUNT OF HOMELESS THAT WE

04:58:17.613 --> 04:58:19.448

THAT ARE TOO MUCH OF AN EYESORE

04:58:30.959 --> 04:58:32.894
YOU SEE THE LOGIC THAT IS NOT

IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THREE

04:59:08.130 --> 04:59:10.165
TWENTY NINE. HOUSING VOUCHERS

04:59:10.232 --> 04:59:12.034
ARE FOR THOSE ON THE VERGE OF

04:59:12.100 --> 04:59:13.602
HOMELESSNESS AND CAN BE THE

04:59:13.669 --> 04:59:15.370
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING A

04:59:15.437 --> 04:59:16.638
ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. OR BEING

04:59:16.705 --> 04:59:18.874
ON THE STREETS. CONTRARY TO

04:59:18.940 --> 04:59:19.908
WHAT YOU MIGHT HEAR THE

04:59:19.975 --> 04:59:22.144
MAJORITY OF VOUCHER HOLDERS ARE

04:59:22.210 --> 04:59:24.079
SENIOR CITIZENS SINGLE PARENT

04:59:24.146 --> 04:59:26.081
FAMILIES. AND PEOPLE WITH

04:59:26.148 --> 04:59:29.251
DISABILITIES. NOT CRIMINALS. MY

04:59:29.318 --> 04:59:31.086
CITIES AND MANY OTHER CITIES

04:59:31.153 --> 04:59:32.454
USE HOUSING VOUCHERS TO HELP

04:59:32.521 --> 04:59:34.523
FIGHT HOMELESSNESS. AND IT IS

04:59:34.589 --> 04:59:36.858
IN STE INEXCUSABLE. THAT

04:59:36.925 --> 04:59:38.694
LANDLORDS WOULD DISCRIMINATE.

04:59:38.760 --> 04:59:40.329
AND WON'T EVEN CONSIDER A

04:59:40.395 --> 04:59:43.098
PROSPECTIVE TENANT IF THEY WILL

04:59:43.165 --> 04:59:45.367
BE PAYING RENT WITH THE VOUCHER.

04:59:45.434 --> 04:59:46.435
IN MY DISTRICT THE PROB PROBLEM

04:59:46.501 --> 04:59:47.869
HAS GOTTEN SO BAD THAT MANY

04:59:47.936 --> 04:59:49.271
TENANTS WHO HAVE BEEN LUCKY

04:59:49.338 --> 04:59:50.405
ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN AWARDED A

04:59:50.472 --> 04:59:52.274
VOUCHER. CAN'T FIND HOUSING

04:59:52.341 --> 04:59:54.876
THAT WILL ACCEPT IT. I

04:59:54.943 --> 04:59:56.278
LITERALLY HAVE HOMELESS PEOPLE

04:59:56.345 --> 04:59:58.547
WITH VOUCHERSTELLING MY

04:59:58.613 --> 05:00:00.282
DISTRICT OFFICE THAT THEY ARE

05:00:00.349 --> 05:00:02.017
USELESS BECAUSE THE MINUTE THEY

05:00:02.084 --> 05:00:04.786
TELL LANDLORD THEIR SECTION

05:00:04.853 --> 05:00:05.387
EIGHT. THEIR TURN DOWN THAT'S

05:00:05.454 --> 05:00:08.090
JUST WRONG. ACCORDING TO THE

05:00:08.156 --> 05:00:11.493
LOS ANGELES TIMES 76% OF

05:00:11.560 --> 05:00:13.061
LANDLORDS CONTACTED BY THEN

05:00:13.128 --> 05:00:14.963
REFUSED TO ACCEPT VOUCHERS THEY

05:00:15.030 --> 05:00:17.866
JUST FLAT OUT REFUSE. IN A

05:00:17.933 --> 05:00:19.134
FLUID COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTY

05:00:19.201 --> 05:00:22.871
SUCH AS MY DISTRICT 82% OF THE

05:00:22.938 --> 05:00:23.905
LANDLORDS WOULDN'T TAKE

05:00:23.972 --> 05:00:26.575
VOUCHERS. DENIAL RATES WERE FAR

05:00:26.641 --> 05:00:29.111
LOWER IN CITIES THAT PROHIBITED

05:00:29.177 --> 05:00:30.812
A PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION

05:00:30.879 --> 05:00:33.548
AGAINST VOUCHER HOLDERS. THIS

05:00:33.615 --> 05:00:36.218
BILL DOES NOT FORCE LANDLORDS

05:00:36.284 --> 05:00:38.053
TO RENT TO ANY GIVEN TENANT BUT

05:00:38.120 --> 05:00:39.588
SIMPLY REQUIRES THEM TO GIVE

05:00:39.654 --> 05:00:41.423
EVERY TENANT THE SAME

05:00:41.490 --> 05:00:42.858
OPPORTUNITY TO FILL OUT AN

05:00:42.924 --> 05:00:44.993
APPLICATION REGARDLESS OF HOW

05:00:45.060 --> 05:00:46.728
THEY'LL BE PAYING THE RENT.

05:00:46.795 --> 05:00:48.330
IT'S STILL ALLOWS FOR CREDIT

05:00:48.397 --> 05:00:50.399
CHECKS RENTAL HISTORY AND OTHER

05:00:50.465 --> 05:00:53.635
REFERENCE CHECKS. MEMBERS LET

05:00:56.204 --> 05:00:57.606
CITIES ACROSS THE STATE DID

05:00:57.672 --> 05:00:59.074
THEIR HOMELESS COUNTS AND WHAT

05:00:59.141 --> 05:01:01.143
EVERY CITY FOUND WAS THAT THE

05:01:01.209 --> 05:01:03.278
RISE IN HOMELESSNESS WAS

05:01:03.345 --> 05:01:05.747
DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

05:01:05.814 --> 05:01:07.616
RISE IN RENTS AND THE LACK OF

05:01:07.682 --> 05:01:09.351
AFFORDABILITY. AROUND THE

05:01:09.418 --> 05:01:11.987
STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU

05:01:13.455 --> 05:01:15.257
WILL LET TENANTS KNOW THAT THE

05:01:15.323 --> 05:01:17.192
LEGISLATURE IS SERIOUS ABOUT TO

05:01:17.259 --> 05:01:18.927
HAVE IT PROTECTIONS. AND

05:01:18.994 --> 05:01:20.128
KEEPING PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES

05:01:20.195 --> 05:01:21.963
AS WE WORK TO SIGNIFICANTLY

05:01:22.030 --> 05:01:25.100

THE SENSATIONALISM THAT WE'VE

05:01:35.977 --> 05:01:37.679
HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO

05:01:37.746 --> 05:01:39.915
SPEAKERS IS IT SECTION EIGHT IS

05:01:39.981 --> 05:01:42.384
A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. NO

05:01:42.451 --> 05:01:44.152
LANDLORD HAS TO PARTICIPATE. IN

05:01:44.219 --> 05:01:47.155
SECTION EIGHT. ONLY IF THEY

05:01:47.222 --> 05:01:50.192
DECIDE THAT THEY WANT. TO

05:01:50.258 --> 05:01:51.893
PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT DO

05:01:51.960 --> 05:01:54.996
THEY HAVE TO THAT'S FEDERAL LAW.

05:01:55.063 --> 05:01:57.899
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS

05:01:57.966 --> 05:01:59.801
IT SAYS IF SOMEONE DECIDES NOT

05:01:59.868 --> 05:02:02.571
TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM.

05:02:02.637 --> 05:02:04.906

05:02:10.045 --> 05:02:12.714
SOMEONE WHO IS AND THEY DECIDE

NO I DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE

05:02:13.381 --> 05:02:14.850
IN SECTION EIGHT I'M GOING TO

05:02:14.916 --> 05:02:16.151
RENT. TO THE NON SECTION EIGHT

05:02:16.218 --> 05:02:20.188
TENANTS. THEY ARE NOW OPEN UP

05:02:20.255 --> 05:02:21.623
TO LAWSUITS AND THAT'S REALLY

05:02:21.690 --> 05:02:23.325
WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. IT'S

05:02:23.391 --> 05:02:24.659
ANOTHER CONSUMER ATTORNEY

05:02:24.726 --> 05:02:26.495
LAWSUIT MIL TO GO AFTER

PEOPLE CAN REJECT SECTION EIGHT

05:02:33.602 --> 05:02:34.336
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO

05:02:34.402 --> 05:02:35.337
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM

05:02:35.403 --> 05:02:37.272
THAT. IS FEDERAL LAW AND

05:02:37.339 --> 05:02:39.174
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO SO. WE

05:02:39.241 --> 05:02:41.543
DON'T NEED TO HAVE THIS

05:02:41.610 --> 05:02:42.110
PROVISION IN THERE WE DON'T

05:02:42.177 --> 05:02:43.445
NEED TO HAVE THIS PROVISION IN

05:02:43.512 --> 05:02:45.881
LAW. IN ALL THE ONLY THING THE

05:02:45.947 --> 05:02:47.382

VERY CLEAR THE ONLY THING THIS

05:02:50.719 --> 05:02:53.655
DO IS SETTING UP. LANDLORDS FOR

05:02:53.722 --> 05:02:54.256
FURTHER LAWSUITS AND WHAT WILL

05:02:54.322 --> 05:02:57.759
THAT DO. IT WILL CAUSE

05:02:57.826 --> 05:02:59.294
LANDLORDS TO RENT TO LESS

05:02:59.361 --> 05:03:01.396
PEOPLE IT WILL CAUSE PEOPLE TO

05:03:01.463 --> 05:03:02.831
LESS PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED IN

05:03:02.898 --> 05:03:04.399
IN THE RENTAL MARKET. FOR

05:03:04.466 --> 05:03:07.035
HOUSING. AND THEREBY AGAIN

05:03:07.102 --> 05:03:09.137
DECREASED SUPPLY. AND WHAT IS

05:03:09.204 --> 05:03:11.039
DECREASING SUPPLY DO THAT'S

05:03:11.106 --> 05:03:14.442
RIGHT IT RAISES RENTS. SO ALL

05:03:14.509 --> 05:03:16.945
THIS LIKE FEEL GOOD THINGS THAT

05:03:17.012 --> 05:03:17.512
WE'RE DOING WE'RE GONNA HAVE

05:03:17.579 --> 05:03:18.113
ANOTHER MEASURE BEFORE US HERE

05:03:18.179 --> 05:03:20.849

HOUSING BECOMING LESS

05:03:25.887 --> 05:03:28.156
AFFORDABLE. AND SO I WOULD

05:03:28.223 --> 05:03:32.060
ARGUE THAT. AGAIN WE DON'T NEED

05:03:32.127 --> 05:03:34.195
THIS MEASURE INTO LAW IT WILL

05:03:34.262 --> 05:03:35.931

CONFRONTED OBVIOUSLY ON THIS

05:08:20.481 --> 05:08:22.150
FLOOR WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF

05:08:22.217 --> 05:08:23.651
ISSUES CONCERNING HOUSING AND

05:08:23.718 --> 05:08:26.321
HOMELESSNESS AND WE CONTINUE TO

05:08:26.387 --> 05:08:28.056
KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD

05:08:28.122 --> 05:08:29.390
BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU DRESS SUCH

05:08:29.457 --> 05:08:30.892
AN ISSUE LIKE THAT. THERE ARE

05:08:30.959 --> 05:08:32.560
SO MANY WHO HAVE CONFLICTS

05:08:32.627 --> 05:08:33.761
PERSONAL CONFLICTS WHETHER

RENTERS AND THESE THINGS ARE

05:08:40.668 --> 05:08:41.736
CRITICAL ISSUES AND YET WE KEEP

05:08:41.803 --> 05:08:43.037
TALKING ABOUT THE HOMELESS

05:08:43.104 --> 05:08:45.173
PROBLEM IS IF SOMEONE ELSE IS

05:08:45.240 --> 05:08:47.041
GOING TO SOLVE IT FOR US.

05:08:47.108 --> 05:08:48.810
SOMEHOW ANOTHER MAGICALLY THIS

05:08:48.877 --> 05:08:50.144
IS GOING TO RESOLVE ITSELF AS

05:08:50.211 --> 05:08:51.913
WE CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH OF

05:08:51.980 --> 05:08:53.214
ALL THE PRACTICES THAT WE'VE

05:08:53.281 --> 05:08:55.216
DONE THAT BASICALLY KEEP THIS

05:08:55.283 --> 05:08:57.118
SITUATION GROWING AND GROWING

05:08:57.185 --> 05:08:59.454
IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE'S

05:08:59.520 --> 05:09:00.822
NO NEIGHBORHOOD I KNOW OF IN

05:09:00.889 --> 05:09:02.857
SAN DIEGO COUNTY THAT IS NOT

05:09:02.924 --> 05:09:04.959
AFFECTED BY HOMELESSNESS THE

05:09:05.026 --> 05:09:06.794
MOST RESIDENTIAL AREAS YOU LOOK

05:09:06.861 --> 05:09:08.496
AND SOMEONE IS UNDER A BRIDGE

05:09:08.563 --> 05:09:10.632
UNDER SOME BUSHES OR TREE OR

05:09:10.698 --> 05:09:11.399
SOMEWHERE. AND THIS IS REALLY

05:09:11.466 --> 05:09:13.735
OUR PROBLEM AND THE WE'RE GOING

05:09:13.801 --> 05:09:14.836
TO HAVE TO SOLVE IT AND THIS IS

05:09:14.903 --> 05:09:17.572
A SMALL STEP IN DOING THAT. IT

05:09:17.639 --> 05:09:21.109
REMINDS ME AS I. WHEN I WAS IN

05:09:21.175 --> 05:09:21.743
AUSTRALIA BUT A YEAR AND A HALF

05:09:21.809 --> 05:09:25.880
AGO. AND WE WERE CONFRONTED WE

05:09:25.947 --> 05:09:27.615
WOULD TIME SYDNEY. AND SOMEONE

05:09:27.682 --> 05:09:28.249
ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR HOMELESS

05:09:28.316 --> 05:09:30.151
PROBLEM. WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF

05:09:30.218 --> 05:09:31.719
PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS

05:09:31.786 --> 05:09:32.720
AND IT WOULDN'T SEE THESE WE

05:09:32.787 --> 05:09:33.621
DIDN'T SEE THESE THINGS

05:09:33.688 --> 05:09:35.456
OCCURRING AND SO WE SAID WHAT

05:09:35.523 --> 05:09:37.025
WHAT DID YOU DO WHAT ROB WHAT

05:09:37.091 --> 05:09:38.726
WE LOOK FOR THE MAGIC THAT WE

05:09:38.793 --> 05:09:40.862
THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO FIND

05:09:40.929 --> 05:09:41.429
SOME. MAJOR LEGISLATION THAT

05:09:41.496 --> 05:09:43.698
WAS GOING TO BE SO UNIQUE. AND

05:09:43.765 --> 05:09:45.833
THIS WOMAN SAID TO ME VERY

05:09:45.900 --> 05:09:48.303
HONESTLY SHE SAID WE DECIDED.

05:09:48.369 --> 05:09:49.737
THAT HOMELESSNESS WAS AN

05:09:49.804 --> 05:09:52.974
AFFRONT TO OUR HUMANITY. HE

05:09:53.041 --> 05:09:54.943
SAID EVERY TIME WE SAW SOMEONE

05:09:55.009 --> 05:09:56.844
WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE BASICS LIKE

05:09:56.911 --> 05:09:58.713
A PLACE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT THAT

05:09:58.780 --> 05:10:00.515
WAS SECURE SHE SAID I FELT

05:10:00.581 --> 05:10:02.850
LESS. THAN A HUMAN BEING. AND I

05:10:02.917 --> 05:10:06.254
FEEL THE SAME WAY. AND MOST OF

05:10:06.321 --> 05:10:09.123
YOU DO TOO WE DRIVE DOWN THE

05:10:09.190 --> 05:10:09.657
STREET WAS SOMETIMES EVEN

05:10:09.724 --> 05:10:11.659
AFRAID TO LET PEOPLE AYE AYE.

05:10:11.726 --> 05:10:12.894
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY THAT

05:10:12.961 --> 05:10:15.763
THEY ARE HURTING AND THE AND

05:10:15.830 --> 05:10:16.364
WITH THAT WE PROBABLY CAN DO

05:10:16.431 --> 05:10:18.533
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BUT WE'RE

05:10:18.599 --> 05:10:21.035
LOOKING FOR COMFORT ZONE THAT

05:10:21.102 --> 05:10:21.636
ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE TO EXIST

05:10:21.703 --> 05:10:24.038
WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING. THIS IS

05:10:24.105 --> 05:10:26.274
NOT A MAJOR MAJOR ISSUE BUT IT

05:10:26.341 --> 05:10:28.009
IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. THAT

05:10:28.076 --> 05:10:30.945
THOSE WHO WANT TO RENT A PLACE.

05:10:31.012 --> 05:10:32.113
HAVE AT LEAST THE OPPORTUNITY

05:10:32.180 --> 05:10:34.048
TO PROVE TO THE LANDLORD THEN I

05:10:34.115 --> 05:10:36.918
AM A PERSON WORTHY. WORTHY

05:10:36.985 --> 05:10:40.054
BECAUSE I'M A HUMAN BEING. OF

TIME SOMETHING COMES UP WHEN I

05:10:46.127 --> 05:10:48.262
SEE SOMEONE I JUST FEEL LIKE.

05:10:48.329 --> 05:10:49.564

TO INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

05:11:56.130 --> 05:11:58.866
ACCESS IT DOES NOT SAY YOU MUST

RENT TO FOLKS WHO ARE ON

DISCRIMINATION BILL. AND WE

05:12:13.614 --> 05:12:15.283

05:12:15.349 --> 05:12:16.918
ON SO MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES

05:12:16.984 --> 05:12:19.287
ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE EQUITY

05:12:19.353 --> 05:12:21.222
INTO THE POLICIES THAT WE ARE

05:12:23.591 --> 05:12:26.727
ABOUT GREATER EQUITY. I DON'T

05:12:26.794 --> 05:12:28.296
KNOW IF I HAVE SHARED THE STORY

05:12:28.362 --> 05:12:31.332
BEFORE BUT I AM THE PRODUCT OF

05:12:31.399 --> 05:12:35.236
A BIRACIAL MARRIAGE MY DAD IS

05:12:35.303 --> 05:12:37.972
WHITE AND MY MOTHER IS BLACK.

05:12:38.039 --> 05:12:40.641
AND IN CHICAGO IN THE VERY

05:12:40.708 --> 05:12:42.810
EARLY SEVENTIES THEY WERE

05:12:42.877 --> 05:12:44.846
LOOKING TO RENT AN APARTMENT

05:12:44.912 --> 05:12:47.048
AND MY MOTHER HADTO WORK SO MY

05:12:47.115 --> 05:12:47.548
DAD WENT OUT LOOK FOR AN

05:12:47.615 --> 05:12:51.085
APARTMENT. AND HE FOUND A NICE

05:12:51.152 --> 05:12:53.020
PLACE YOU APPLY. AND THE

05:12:53.087 --> 05:12:55.957
LANDLORD SHOWED HIM AROUND AND

05:12:56.023 --> 05:12:56.591
AT THE END HE SAID WHERE'S YOUR

05:12:56.657 --> 05:12:59.727
WIFE. AND HE SAID WELL SHE'S

05:12:59.794 --> 05:13:04.398
WORKING. AND EARLIER HE HAD

05:13:04.465 --> 05:13:05.900
DISCUSSED WANTING TO RENT TO MY

05:13:05.967 --> 05:13:10.505
DAD. AND AT THE VERY LAST

05:13:10.571 --> 05:13:11.072
MINUTE BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS

05:13:11.139 --> 05:13:13.174
NOT THERE. THE LANDLORD TOOK A

05:13:13.241 --> 05:13:18.446
PAUSE. IN SAID. I'M GOING TO

05:13:18.513 --> 05:13:21.782
FILE THE APPLICATION AWAY. MY

05:13:21.849 --> 05:13:22.383
DAD WENT HOME SHARED THIS WITH

05:13:22.450 --> 05:13:25.486
MY MOTHER. THEY CALL TWO

05:13:25.553 --> 05:13:27.088
FRIENDS OF THEIRS WHO WERE NOT

05:13:27.155 --> 05:13:30.458
MARRIED BUT WERE BOTH WHITE AND

05:13:30.525 --> 05:13:31.025
THEY SAID PRETEND TO GO AND

05:13:31.092 --> 05:13:33.161
LOOK AT THIS APARTMENT. AND SO

05:13:33.227 --> 05:13:38.299
THEY DID. AND THE LANDLORD SET

05:13:38.366 --> 05:13:41.269
SO GREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH HERE I

05:13:41.335 --> 05:13:45.273
HAVE AN APARTMENT READY FOR YOU.

05:13:45.339 --> 05:13:45.873
NO ONE ELSE HAS LOOKED FOR IT

05:13:45.940 --> 05:13:48.576
AND WENT TO THEM. AND MY FOLKS

05:13:48.643 --> 05:13:50.845
ACTUALLY HAD TO FILE AN APPEAL.

05:13:50.912 --> 05:13:52.313
WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IN

05:13:52.380 --> 05:13:54.448
CHICAGO. BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN

05:13:54.515 --> 05:13:56.751
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE

05:13:56.817 --> 05:14:00.054
MY MOTHER WAS BLACK. JUST FORTY

05:14:00.121 --> 05:14:03.558
PLUS YEARS AGO. THIS IS AN

05:14:03.624 --> 05:14:07.495
EXTENSION OF THAT EXPERIENCE

05:14:07.562 --> 05:14:08.696
NOW MY FOLKS GOT THAT APARTMENT.

05:14:08.763 --> 05:14:13.134
BECAUSE. THEY WERE VIABLE

05:14:13.201 --> 05:14:17.738
APPLICANTS. IT WASN'T SOME SORT

05:14:17.805 --> 05:14:20.942
OF RETRIBUTION FOR RACISM AND

05:14:21.008 --> 05:14:21.509
THEY TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY

05:14:21.576 --> 05:14:24.378
GOOD TENANTS. IN FACT THE

05:14:24.445 --> 05:14:25.846
LANDLORD TOLD THEM THAT A YEAR

05:14:25.913 --> 05:14:28.649
LATER HE SAID I DIDN'T EXPECT

05:14:28.716 --> 05:14:29.250
THAT YOU ALL WOULD BE SO GOOD.

05:14:29.317 --> 05:14:31.152
BUT IN FACT. YOU TURNED OUT TO

05:14:31.219 --> 05:14:35.756
BE OKAY. THIS IS AN EXTENSION

05:14:35.823 --> 05:14:38.993
OF THAT EXPERIENCE. AND SO

05:14:39.060 --> 05:14:40.261
WHILE IT MAY BE TOUGH FOR SOME

05:14:40.328 --> 05:14:41.896

SEEMED INADEQUATE FORTUNATELY

06:12:39.170 --> 06:12:41.405
THIS HOUSE REQUIRED AN AUDIT BY

THE LA L. AN AUDIT BY THE STATE

06:12:43.374 --> 06:12:44.975

WE OBTAINED THROUGH THOSE AUDIT

06:12:47.378 --> 06:12:48.779
SHOWED THAT WHAT THE STATE BAR

06:12:48.846 --> 06:12:49.180
WAS ASKING FOR WAS

06:12:49.246 --> 06:12:50.081
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THEY

06:12:50.147 --> 06:12:52.216
COULD JUSTIFY. SO WHILE THIS

06:12:52.283 --> 06:12:54.385
BILL DOES INCLUDE. AN INCREASE

06:12:54.452 --> 06:12:56.821
IN THE IN THE ANNUAL DUES. IT

06:12:56.887 --> 06:12:58.289
IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL IS

06:12:58.355 --> 06:13:00.191

06:13:00.257 --> 06:13:01.859
THIS BILL CONTAINS PROVISIONS

IN WAYS THAT THE STATE AUDITOR

06:13:06.931 --> 06:13:09.366
AND THE LA. SUGGESTED AND AGAIN

06:13:09.433 --> 06:13:10.701

06:13:15.906 --> 06:13:17.408

06:13:17.475 --> 06:13:18.242

ARE OBJECTING TO PAYING TO

06:13:21.011 --> 06:13:22.613
HIGHER FEES. BUT THE FACT THAT

THEY HAVEN'T BEEN RAISED IN A

06:13:23.514 --> 06:13:25.382
NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE FACT

06:13:25.449 --> 06:13:27.585
THAT THAT THIS NUMBER THAT IS

06:13:27.651 --> 06:13:28.986

BY BOTH THE LA AND THE STATE

06:13:30.721 --> 06:13:32.189
AUDITOR. I THINK IT IS A

06:13:32.256 --> 06:13:33.791
REASONABLE STEP BUT THAT SHOULD

06:13:33.858 --> 06:13:35.459
NOT AT ALL TAKE AWAY FROM THE
