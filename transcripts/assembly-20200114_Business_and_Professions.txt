AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. I APPRECIATE YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF CONTINUING TO WORK WITH MY STAFF AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ISSUE. I REMAIN DEDICATED TO ENSURE PUBLIC AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. IN REGARDS TO ENSURING PROPER LICENSORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO BE SURE THAT THIS IS IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY. AB TWENTY TEN TWENTY FOUR WILL ESTABLISH A LICENSING PROCESS FOR HOME INSPECTORS. FOR MOST PEOPLE A HOME PURCHASE WILL BE THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT THEY WILL MAKE IN THEIR LIFETIME. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY THE BEST TRAINED WORKFORCE. BUT ALSO A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THE CONSUMER. IS PROTECTED. THIS BILL INTENDS TO CREATE A LICENSORS THAT WILL DO JUST THAT. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF JUST A FEW PROFESSIONS THAT REQUIRE A LICENSE AUTOMOTIVE. BARBERING TEN COSMETOLOGY. CANNABIS CEMETERY IN FEWER FUNERAL CONTRACTORS ELECTRONIC AN APPLIANCE REPAIR TO SAY IF YOU. A HOME INSPECTION INCLUDES EVALUATION OF MAJOR MECHANICAL FEATURES OF A HOME THAT COULD PRESENT HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES IF NOT ASSESSED BY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH PROPER TRAINING AND EXPERTISE. ADDITIONALLY THERE CAN BE COSTLY TROUBLES ARE KNOWN TO THE BUYER. THAT MAY NOT BE VISIBLE DURING A SHOWING AN EXPERT EVALUATION IS NEEDED TO PREVENT COSTLY AND POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS LATER DOWN THE ROAD. BY REQUIRING A LICENSE THIS MEASURE WILL ALSO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR CONSUMERS WHO HAVE COMPLAINTS ADDRESSED BY THAT LICENSING ENTITY IN THE EVENT THE ISSUES. IF THEY ARISE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I WAS A CONTRACTOR FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND RECENTLY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS HAD TO HOME INSPECTIONS THAT WERE. GLARINGLY DEFICIENT. AND WHAT I'M SAYING IS A CONTRACTOR I WENT THROUGH THE PROPER OF APPLICATION PROCESS. AND THEN ALSO HAD A- APPLICATION ALL RIGHT TEST TO MAKE SURE IT WAS COMPETENT TO MOVE FORWARD LUCKILY I PASSED. BUT ON IN THAT AFFECTS RIGHT NOW TO BE A HOME INSPECTOR. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BUY A CLIPBOARD. AND GO OUT AND DO THESE INSPECTIONS. UNDERSTANDING THAT. AS I MENTIONED THE WHOLE VALUE OF THE HOME THE THINGS THAT COULD BE MISS THEIR PUT IN THE- RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UNKNOWING HOMEOWNER IT CAN COST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. BUT ALL I'M SAYING IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS NOT ONLY PROTECT THE HOMEOWNER BUT ALSO PROTECT THE INDUSTRY FOR HOME INSPECTORS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD HOME INSPECTORS OUT THERE. VERY GOOD. THE LICENSING OF PROCESS FOR THE CONTRACTORS IS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE APPLICATION AND THEN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR LICENSE FEE. BUT WHAT THEY GET IS. THAT THEY'RE VALID TEY'RE ACTUALLY RELEVANT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE PROFESSIONAL. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE HOMEOWNERS PROTECTED IN THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD INSPECTION GOING FORWARD FOR THOSE FOLKS ON THEIR LIFE SAVINGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS FRAZIER AND WILL PAUSE FOR A MOMENT TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. HELLO DEAR BRO. ARAMBULA BLOOM. CHEN CHIU. CUNNINGHAM EGGMAN. FONG GIPSON GLORIA GRAYSON ALDEN IRWIN MCCARTY MEDINA MULLIN OBERNOLTE TING. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR STEPS A QUORUM AND WILL PROVIDE UP TO THREE MNUTES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PERCENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YES UGH THE MORNING- VERY REEFS STEVE CREWS ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION HERE IN SUPPORT- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED- FOR MANY. THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT- THAT THEY'RE MAKING TRANSACTION AND FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT INAPPROPRIATE- THAT INSPECTORS ARE AE PROPERLY TRAINED AND ABLE TO CARRY OUT THESE DUTIES- AND IN A WAY THIS COMMENSURATE WITH THE INVESTMENT SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WERE HERE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE NOW LIKE TO CALL IT MEMBERS OF PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE- TABLE. AND AGAIN AND WILL PROVIDE UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. IT'S COUNTY IDENTIFY YOURSELF AS WELL. MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS DON'T RESPECT A PATH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HERE IN OPPOSITION AB TEN TWENTY FOUR. ZERO SPORTS EFFORTS TO LICENSE AND IMPROVE PROFESSIONALS WITHIN THE HOME INSPECTION INDUSTRY. HOWEVER WE MUST BE MINDFUL OF THE IMPACTS LICENSING COULD HAVE ON REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS PARTICIPATE IN OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS ANNUALLY. OUR INTEREST IN MAKING SURE HOME INSPECTIONS ARE PROPERLY REGULATED AND LICENSED AS OBVIOUS. AS A VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS UTILIZE A HOME INSPECTOR. THE HOME INSPECTORS REPORT IS A VITAL FORMA CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR BUYERS. SO MUCH SO THAT WE HAVE A STANDARD FORM THAT REQUIRES BUYERS TO FORMALLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A HOME INSPECTION AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A BUYER IS ACTING AGAINST THE ADVICE OF THE BROKER. THEY ARE ALSO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING SHOULD BE USED UNDULY RESTRICT ENTRY INTO A PROFESSION. THE LICENSING PROGRAM MUST BE TAILORED TO BOTH PROTECT CONSUMERS. WHILE ALLOWING QUALIFIED DILIGENT HOME INSPECTORS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHIN THEIR CURRENT PROFESSION. ASSURING THAT WE HAVE THE NECESSARY SUPPLY OF HOME INSPECTORS AVAILABLE TO COMPLETE INSPECTIONS NECESSITATED BY THE TRANSFER REAL PROPERTY. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE INITIAL PROPOSED AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. WHILE THE AUTHORS MOST RECENT DRAFT OF AMENDMENTS INCLUDE IN THE ANALYSIS ARE AN IMPROVEMENT WE MUST RESPECTFULLY REMAIN UP. AT THIS TIME. WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL ENSURE PARTIES TO CREATE AN APPROPRIATE LICENSING PROGRAM WHICH PROTECTS CONSUMERS. BUT DOES NOT UNDULY LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF HOME INSPECTORS TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE WITH IN REAL ESTATE. TRANSACTION AND ARTIST YOUR PROCESS. WE FROM LEAVE THE MORE TIME WE CAN REACH CONSENSUS ON HOW BEST TO ESTABLISH A LICENSING PROGRAM AND ADMISSIONS STANDARDS FOR HOME INSPECTORS. WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU YES MY NAME IS DAVID PACE I'VE BEEN A HOME INSPECTOR FOR THE PAST TWENTY SIX YEARS. PRIOR TO THAT I SPENT TWELVE YEARS IN CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AND BEFORE THAT I POUNDED NAILS. I'M A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INSPECTION ASSOCIATION KNOWN AS CREA I SERVICE THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR FOR CREA. CREA IS THE OLDEST AND LARGEST NONPROFIT STATE INSPECTOR ASSOCIATION IN THE COUNTRY. AND THIS CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC IN EDUCATION AND CONSUMER OUT REACH. THE VISION OF KOREA IS TO PROTECT THE LIVES HEALTH AND INVEST. THE POSITION OF KOREA HAS ALWAYS BEEN WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO LICENSING OF HOME INSPECTORS HOWEVER WE ARE OPPOSED TO BAD LICENSING. THE MOST IMPORTANT STATEMENT OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU IS SECTION SEVENTY ONE NINETY FOUR POINT THREE IT'S STATES QUOTE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC SHALL BE. THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF THE AUTHORITY OF HOME INSPECTORS IN EXERCISING ITS LICENSING REGULATORY AND DISCIPLINARY FUNCTIONS. WHENEVER THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC IS INCONSISTENT WITH OTHER INTERESTS OUGHT TO BE PROMOTED. THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC SHALL BE PARAMOUNT. ANY LICENSING MUST HAVE AS ITS HIGHEST PRIORITY THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC. I WOULD NOT WANT A CONTRACTOR WHO IS NOT FULLY QUALIFIED TO FRAME MY HOUSE. I WOULD NOT WANT TO NON QUALIFIED ELECTRICIAN TO WIRE MY HOUSE. I WOULD NOT WANT A PLUMBER WHO IS NOT QUALIFIED RUNNING MY WATER LINES DRAIN LINES. A CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE THE HIGHEST CONFIDENCE THAT HIS HOME INSPECTOR. EXAMINES TO STRUCTURE THE ELECTRICAL THE PLUMBING IS QUALIFIED. HAS THE EXPERT IT'S TO PROPERLY EVALUATE LIGHT THE LOCK JUST PURCHASED THEIR LIFETIME. A LICENSURE WITH QUALIFICATION EDUCATION AND TRAINING. THE IDENTIFIES THE ANSWER IS IN THE PROTECT THE CONSUMER. BECAUSE THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC AS THE BILL STATES IS PARAMOUNT EIGHTY LICENSE YOUR BILL MUST INCLUDE A PROCTORED CYCLE INACTIVITY BALLARD CERTIFICATION EXAM. SPECIFIC EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN A LICENSE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS REASONABLE LICENSING FEES A REQUIREMENT FOR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE A SPECIFIED STANDARD PRACTICE THANK YOU IF YOU COULD KINDLY JUST WRAP UP. SURE SO WHILE CREA OPPOSES AS IT IS AMENDED TODAY AB TEN TWENTY FOUR WE WILL REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION- IF IT IS AMENDED TO INCLUDE- CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT I HAVE RAISED AND WE STAND- READY TO WORK WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND WORKING OUT A- A LICENSING- BILL THAT PROTECTS THE CONSUMER AS WELL AS A- AS THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF HELP WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SEE NO ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COULD BE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME AND JUST MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE THANK YOU ALL THE FOR BRING THIS WERE ALWAYS ASSUME THAT THE INSPECTORS WILL WAS LICENSED- WHEN THEY CAME TO SOMEONE'S HOME IS IT YOUR INTENT TO WANT PROFESSIONAL LIES- THIS INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CONSUMER PROTECTION IS THERE BY HAVING SOMEONE. ASSOCIATIONS LICENSE TO THIS PARTICULAR PROCESS IS THAT YOUR INTENT. YES SIR YES I MEAN YOU KNOW THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT I SPENT AS A CONTRACTOR- AND FURTHERING MY EDUCATION GOING ON TRYING TO SCORE SEVEN OR SO WHY NOT. WHEN I HAD. WHAT I WOULD CALL A LESSON SATISFACTORY EXPERIENCE WITH. HOME INSPECTOR ON MY OWN PURCHASE. RIGHT BECAUSE I WAS AN EXPERT IN MY FIELD I NOTICED THAT IT WAS. LESS THAN PROFESSIONAL AND PUT ME AT RISK SO WE ALWAYS LOOK AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO DO BILLS THAT HAVE AN IMPACT OR BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD A LIFE EXPERIENCE. THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE CREDIBILITY. AND THE PUBLIC- THE PUBLIC OR THE CONSUMER NEWS THAT THERE WAS A PROCESS THAT TOOK PLACE. THAT MADE THEM VALID AND RELEVANT IN THEIR HOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TO THE SOLICITATION- I HEARD IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU WERE SPEAKING OF. THE FEE THAT WOULD COST TO. THE INDUSTRY AS REALLY RELATES TO- THIS PROFESSION- BEING LICENSE- DO YOU THINK THAT'S A- MORE GREATER CONCERN THAN HAVING A PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION BY WHICH THE- HIGHER FEEL COMFORTABLE KNOWING THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO PROVIDE. AS PERFECT. NEXT YEAR. AND IT'S NOT THE COST OF IT SO GREAT OF GIPSON THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS AVAILABILITY OF HOME INSPECTORS AND COST TO THE CONSUMERS ARE CLIENTS THIS IS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE PURCHASING A HOME USUALLY ON THE MARGINS- ANY INCREASE TO THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE A HOME. LIKE SCHOOL. THE UP. SIDE I'M OUR CONCERN IS IF YOU RAISE ARE SO HOT BILL CREE INSPECTION VIEWED EITHER PEOPLE WAVE INSPECTION REQUIRE WHICH THEY SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO HAVE A THIRD PARTY COME IN- AND DO INDEPENDENT. OF. COMPONENT HOMES CONSTRUCTIONS ARE GENERALLY LOVE. VISUAL INSPECTIONS OF THE HOME SIMILAR TO WHAT REALTORS DO WITHIN THE TRANSACTION PROCESS- SOMEONE WILL ALSO REQUIRE IN A BUYER'S INSPECTION THE HOME INSPECTOR COMES IN AS AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY LOOKING AT- THINGS LIKE OUT LEADS- BIG THEY'RE NOT EXPERTS IN RUSTON ON EXPERTS AND FOUNDATIONS CLEARLY- BUT THEY'RE DOING IT. A GENERAL VISUAL INSPECTION ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CLIMB UNDER A NATION ARE UP IN THE ATTIC- BUT THEY LOOK AT SORT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE OBVIOUS WITHIN THE HOME TO PROVIDE THE DISCLOSURE- ON AVERAGE WE UNDERSTAND THE COST RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOME INSPECTION. THE CONCERN IS IF YOU GO TO AN EXPERT LICENSE WHERE YOU HAD SAY CONTRACTORS DOING IT. THAT'S A SPECIAL DISCLOSURE- HOME INSPECTORS OF TOLD US THAT WOULD RAISE THE COST OF THE INSPECTION TO BE AROUND TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AS WE'VE HEARD ANECDOTAL AND WE'VE- TO GET THE WILL OF THE BOTTLE TEN YEARS. SO WE'RE NOT POST. THING PRO. JUST BE. CAREFUL WE DON'T. INTEND CONSEQUENCES. OF WITHIN THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THE- REQUIREMENT IS THAT FIVE HUNDRED INSPECTIONS BE CONDUCTED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. THAT'S TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY INSPECTIONS ANNUALLY. IN ORDER TO BE GRANDFATHERED INTO THE LICENSE- THERE'S ONLY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS IN A YEAR AND I'M NOT SURE THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY IS AN ACHIEVABLE STANDARD. FOR THOSE THAT. ARE PROBABLY STILL GOOD ACTORS AND A LICENSE GRANTED LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THERE'S GOOD ACTORS AND BAD ACTORS AND- WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DILIGENT IN CREATING A WORKABLE PROGRAM WITHOUT THE INTERNET CONSEQUENCES. AND I THINK THE INTENT OF THE AUTHORS OF MAKING SURE. THE WEEDS OUT THE BAD ACTORS IN THIS PROCESS BY CREATING A LICENSE- AND SOME BENCHMARKS IN ORDERS FOR. AN INDIVIDUAL OR COMPANY TO HAVE SUCH A LICENSE. PLATE THAT WOULD WANT PROTECT THE CONSUMER WAS PURCHASING THAT. THE HOUSE BECAUSE THAT'S WE WANT TO DO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT INSPECTION IS SUCH. BY WHICH- THE PERSON'S. PURCHASING A HOUSE THE HOUSE IS. IT'S A PARTICULAR STANDARD. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE INTENT IS AN HOUR. ARE YOU. I WORK BROUGH I MEAN AND SIR DID YOU GUYS HAPPEN HOPEFULLY YOU GUYS WILL. BE A SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL- I AGAIN I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE INSPECTOR WASN'T BACK LICENSE COMING INTO. MY HOME BECAUSE WE PURCHASE A HOME THAT'S OF YES NO THAT'S NOT A SMALL SITUATION THAT'S A HUGE INVESTMENT AS WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE- INDIVIDUAL PURCHASING THE HOME. IS COVERED AND SO ONE THANK GOD FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE SAME. THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING- AND SO IS IVORY THE BILL ALSO READ THAT THERE'S A DELAYED AND IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION TO GIVE PEOPLE TIME FIVE YEARS FIVE YEARS CORRECT- AND AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE WITH OPPOSITION AND YOU WERE ALL TRYING TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE. JUST TO MAKE-SURE THAT THERE'S A GOOD PROCESS IN PLACE. PEOPLE BUY HOMES AND THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND SO I'M SURE YOU'RE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AS AS IT MOVES FORWARD IN. THE FIVE YEAR LIMITATION OR THE HOURS ALL OF THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE THOSE ARE DETAILS THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT. AND THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO HEAD TO THE SAME PLACE AT. THAT IS FAIR AND ALSO. BOTH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS HAVE BEEN WITH US FROM DAYONE AND SO- NOT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GO AND BE AN ADVERSARY WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET TO YES AND- MATTER OF FACT I THINK THE GENTLEMAN. GROW TO BE IN IT ORIGINAL BILL FOR THIS AND WE HAD TO AMEND BECAUSE THERE WAS CERTAIN THINGS WERE PROPRIETARY THAT WE DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE NOT JUST THEIR ASSOCIATION BUT ALL INCLUSIVE THE CALIFORNIA HOME INSPECTORS AND SO WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER AND AGAIN WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE ON SOME THINGS AND WAS WE MAY JUSTHAVE TO AFFORD. BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT RIGHT NOW- YOU BY CLIPBOARD YOUR HOME INSPECTOR. IT'S A GREAT CITY. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I THINK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL THAT I DO SUPPORT- TO THE ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS DO YOU HAVE. A MATRIX OR SOMETHING THAT YOU MEASURE TO OR LOOK AT AS GUIDELINES TO QUALIFY A HOME INSPECTOR. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE QUALIFIED TO DO THAT WELL. SO REALTORS ARE NOT SORT OF A WATCHDOG IT'S NOT OUR POSITION TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT- THEIR LICENSE OR NOT I'M ARE REALTORS GENERALLY WILL PROVIDE A LIST OF HOME INSPECTORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE SOME THEY'VE WORKED WITH BEFORE SOME THEY HAVEN'T BECOMES A LIABILITY STANDARD IF THEY RECOMMEND ONLY ONE- AND SO WE GIVE WE GIVE A LIST OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEN- CAUTION THE BUYERS THAT. THEY NEED TO INTERVIEW THE HOME INSPECTORS THEMSELVES TO DETERMINE WHICH HOME INSPECTORS GOING TO BEST FIT THEIR NEEDS RIGHT BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A- A SET OF GUIDELINES OUR METRICS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A HOME INSPECTORS QUALIFIED OR NOT TO ACTUALLY DO HOME INSPECTIONS. NO IN FACT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT THE UNIVERSE OF HOME INSPECTORS ARE STATEWIDE WHICH IS PART OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND WHAT WE'VE HAD DIFFICULTY GRAPPLING WITH WITH AMENDMENTS WITH THE AT THE MOMENT IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THE LICENSING PROGRAM WOULD HAVE- WE KNOW IN ORDER THERE'S- TWO FIVE ARE LIES THESE UP- BUT- OBVIOUSLY THAT. LARGER WE KNOW OF CREEK IS MEMBERSHIP I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE HUNDRED HOME INSPECTORS THEY'RE KIND OF THE GOLD STANDARD THAT'S OUT THERE- BUT QUITE FRANKLY WE ALSO HAVE AYE SHE IS IN THE HOME INSPECTOR A TRADE ASSOCIATION I'M OUR CONCERN IS MAKING. INDIVIDUAL HAVE OCCUPATIONS CURRENTLY IN BEFORE YEAH RIGHT CONTINUE TO PROTEST ABOUT OCCUPATION THEY HAVE TO SPENDING AN FOR TEN YEARS WHETHER THEY HAVE MEMBERSHIP IN A TRADE ASSOCIATION OR NOT. OKAY SO IT SOUNDS. IT IS A- AS WE- TYPE OF PROGRAM I WOULD AGREE CAUGHT. WITH WITH FIVE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION I GIVES US PLENTY OF TIME TO ADD ANY WRINKLES AND MOVE FORWARD SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR WHAT HAD. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THE COMMENTS- FROM MY- COLLEAGUES I. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT- THE OPPOSITION DEFINITELY BRINGS UP SOME GOOD POINTS SO I WOULD HOPE THAT- IF YOU PASS THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK. SO. IN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE MISTER FISHER JEWISH TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE BY LAW THE HOME INSPECTION. AND THE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW KIND OF A SCARY THING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A LIFETIME INVESTMENT- BUT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN YOUR HOME. AT. HAVE NO RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE OF THAT DWELLING OR HOW IT WORKS- THAT'S SCARY ALSO. AND SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M I'M I'M WANT TO THE COMMITTEE TO KNOW HIS FROM DAY ONE WE CALLED IN THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS TO WORK WITH US. GOING FORWARD WE HAVEN'T TRIED TO PUSH ANYTHING WITHOUT. EATING TOO YES ON THIS ON THIS- ON THIS- ISSUE- FIVE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION- ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT AND I HEARD. A COMMENT ABOUT A TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR INSPECTION. IF THE LICENSE FEE IS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR TWO YEARS. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD INCREASE YOU IF YOU HAD TO HUNDRED INSPECTIONS TO AMORTIZE OVER A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR HOW WOULD RAISE IT TO TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT ALSO INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE ABILITY NOT ONLY TO CALL HOME INSPECTOR BUT THEY CAN CALL A LICENSED GENERAL CONTRACTORS THEY WANT. AND WE CAN MOVE TO THAT DIRECTION. IF THAT'S THE WILL OF. OF THE PEOPLE I MEAN SERIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT BUT THERE ARE YOU LICENSED THEY'RE KNOWLEDGEABLE THEY'VE BEEN TESTED. AND WE CAN WE CAN MOVE THAT MOVE THAT BALL THAT WAY. THAT WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE COST OF A HOME INSPECTION. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ESCRIBO.

WELL THE FIRST STEP IN GETTING PEOPLE TO DEMAND REGULATIONS IS SOMETIMES TO HAVE A BILL TO GET THEIR ATTENTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. KATE BUT A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR- SO THIS IS A BILL PROPOSALS WITH THE RESPECT THE VARIANCE OF A EXACTLY YES IT DOES THE ALTERED NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN THE DIFFERENCE OF TWO PERCENT. OF THE POTENCY OF CONSUMPTION. WELL WE CAN HEAR FROM ONE OF MY EXPERTS. SO A ON 2% VARIANCE WOULD BE EXTREMELY MINIMAL SO- AND IF IN A ON HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS THC PRODUCT FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD HAVE A HUNDRED TEN MILLIGRAMS OF THC VERSES HUNDRED AND TWELVE- AND NOT TWO MILLIGRAM VARIATION WOULD- I WOULD I WOULD DIE TEST CONSUMERS IN A BLIND TEST AND SAY. ABSOLUTELY THERE ARE NO- NOTICEABLE EFFECTS OF THAT AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE- THERE ALSO HASN'T BEEN ANY TESTING TO- DETERMINE IF THAT IS A DANGEROUS AMOUNT OF INCREASED AMOUNT OF THC SO- NO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A DETECTABLE- NOT FOR ANY. PERSON WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT DOES. IS THE COURT TO WHICH CLOSE YES THANK YOU AGAIN IF- IF THE REGULATORS ONCE HAVE GOTTEN THEIR ATTENTION.

THANK YOU ARE AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME AB FOURTEENTHS. OH OKAY. AB FOURTEEN- SEVENTY PREVENTS UNNECESSARY WASTE AND COST WHILE STILL MAINTAINING TESTING INTEGRITY BY ALLOWING FOR BATCH TESTING OF MANUFACTURED CANNABIS AS OPPOSED TO TESTING OF SELECTED RETAIL PACKAGE REPRESENTATIVES. SAMPLES CANNABIS SOLD TO CONSUMERS- IS REQUIRED TO BE TESTED FOR CONTENT AND FOR COULD KAMAN IT'S BY VARIOUS TOXICS UNDER CURRENT LAW THESE TEST MUST TAKE PLACE WHEN CANNABIS IS IN ITS FILE FINAL FORM HOWEVER IT IS NOT SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT IT MEANS FOR CANNABIS PRODUCT. BEYOND ITS FINAL FORM CURRENTLY THIS IS DEFINED AS THE WAY A- CONSUMER WITH PURCHASED PRODUCT HOWEVER CONTESTING SHE'S ME CONDUCTING TESTS ON FULLY SEALED IN PACKAGE PRODUCTS IS WASTEFUL AND INTRODUCES UNCERTAINTY TESTING ENVIRONMENT- AND I WILL SAY WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM RIGHT NOW WITH THE BLACK MARKET. IN THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. IS TO MAKE THE BLACK MARKET GO AWAY BY MAKING IT EASIER CHEAPER FOR THE GOOD ACTORS THE PEOPLE OF REGISTERED WHO ARE WHO ACTUALLY DO TESTING WHO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE- PRODUCTS FREE OF TOXICS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WILL STAY IN MARK IN THE MARKET. AS OPPOSED TO BEING DRIVEN OUT BY THE CHEAPER BLACK MARKET IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO. GIVE A QUALITY PRODUCT AND WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS KEEPING SAFETY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME- REDUCING COSTS- I'D LIKE TO CALL ON MY WITNESS.
