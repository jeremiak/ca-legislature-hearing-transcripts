I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH. A

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:57.500
SPECIFICALLY IN THE DUE PROCESS

02:47:57.567 --> 02:47:59.436
ISSUE SO- IN RESPONSE TO THE

02:47:59.502 --> 02:48:00.270
CONCERNS RAISED BY THE

02:48:00.336 --> 02:48:01.571
CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR

02:48:02.372 --> 02:48:03.406

WITH THE DATABASES- JUST I

02:48:07.977 --> 02:48:08.478
THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

02:48:08.545 --> 02:48:09.379
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL

02:48:09.446 --> 02:48:10.647
DOES THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS

02:48:10.713 --> 02:48:11.881
THE DATABASE IF YOU AT ALL

02:48:11.948 --> 02:48:12.749
THAT'S ALREADY CODIFIED IN

02:48:12.816 --> 02:48:14.451
CURRENT STATUTE. THERE'S A

02:48:14.517 --> 02:48:15.752
PROVISION THAT WAS ADDED TO

02:48:15.819 --> 02:48:16.953
THIS BILL THE TO THE JUDICIAL

02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:18.755
COUNCIL REFERENCED THAT

02:48:18.822 --> 02:48:20.890
REQUIRES FOR TEMPORARY

02:48:20.957 --> 02:48:22.258
EMERGENCY RESTRAINING ORDERS

02:48:22.325 --> 02:48:22.859
THAT THOSE BE FILED WITH THE

02:48:22.926 --> 02:48:24.461
COURT WITHIN THREE DAYS AND NOT

02:48:24.527 --> 02:48:25.462
ACTUALLY STRENGTHENED DUE

02:48:25.528 --> 02:48:27.530
PROCESS PROTECTION FOR- FOR GUN

02:48:27.597 --> 02:48:28.998
OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE

02:48:29.065 --> 02:48:29.833
SURE THAT THERE IS A TIMELY

02:48:29.899 --> 02:48:31.601
HEARING ON WHETHER OR NOT THERE

02:48:31.668 --> 02:48:33.102
SHOULD BE A CONTINUING TV ARE

02:48:33.169 --> 02:48:34.404
OUT SO I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE

02:48:34.471 --> 02:48:35.438
BIT OF CONFUSION THERE. ARE

02:48:35.505 --> 02:48:37.073
BILL DOESN'T TOUCH THE DATABASE

02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:38.308
ISSUE IT SOUNDS TO ME FROM THAT

02:48:38.374 --> 02:48:39.209
LETTER LIKE THERE MIGHT BE

02:48:39.275 --> 02:48:41.044
SOME- OR THE EFFORTS TO LOOK

02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:42.278
INTO THAT AND TO TRY TO CLEAN

02:48:42.345 --> 02:48:43.279
UP THOSE DATABASES BUT THIS

02:48:43.346 --> 02:48:44.714
BILL DOESN'T DOESN'T TOUCH THAT

02:48:44.781 --> 02:48:47.250
ISSUE- THE SECOND OBJECTION HAS

02:48:47.317 --> 02:48:48.718
TO DO WITH CROSS REFERENCING

02:48:48.785 --> 02:48:50.086
OUT OF STATE PROCEDURES- IT'S A

02:48:50.153 --> 02:48:51.888
WELL TAKEN POINT- YOU KNOW

02:48:51.955 --> 02:48:53.556
THERE CERTAINLY ARE DIFFERENCES

02:48:53.623 --> 02:48:55.291
FROM STATE TO STATE- AND I'M

02:48:55.358 --> 02:48:56.893
COMMITTED TO IN PARTICULAR

02:48:56.960 --> 02:48:58.294
WORKING WITH THE ACLU TO

02:48:58.361 --> 02:48:59.295

02:48:59.362 --> 02:49:00.897
ABOUT THAT I'M YOU KNOW I SPENT

02:49:00.964 --> 02:49:01.564
SIGNIFICANT TIME IS AN

02:49:01.631 --> 02:49:03.032
ATTORNEY. I PRIOR TO COMING TO

02:49:03.099 --> 02:49:04.000
THE LEGISLATURE ON CASES

UPHOLDING DUE PROCESS RIGHTS I

02:49:05.368 --> 02:49:06.336
THINK DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS

WORRIED ABOUT DUE PROCESS- THIS

02:51:08.891 --> 02:51:10.426
IS THE STRONG VOTING FOR THIS

02:51:10.493 --> 02:51:11.294

04:58:19.448 --> 04:58:19.982
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE IMPROPER

04:58:20.048 --> 04:58:21.383
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. OUR

04:58:21.450 --> 04:58:23.318
CONCERN IS TO CONSERVE NUMBER

04:58:23.385 --> 04:58:26.855
ONE IS. THE FUNDING. SB SIX

04:58:26.922 --> 04:58:27.823
SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH WHICH IS

04:58:27.889 --> 04:58:28.390
THE TRANSFER OF MONEY FROM

04:58:28.457 --> 04:58:30.592
STATE TO LOCAL. THAT THAT MONEY

04:58:30.659 --> 04:58:33.595
IS CONTINGENT UPON SUCCESSFUL

04:58:33.662 --> 04:58:34.096

REHABILITATION EFFORTS.

04:58:35.564 --> 04:58:36.565
UNFORTUNATELY MANY

REHABILITATION EFFORTS WILL

04:58:37.633 --> 04:58:38.867
TAKE LONGER TO YEARS AND IF WE

04:58:38.934 --> 04:58:39.568
DON'T COMPLETE THOSE WE'RE

04:58:39.635 --> 04:58:40.669
GONNA LOSE THAT MUCH SO THAT

04:58:40.736 --> 04:58:41.737
THAT'S A THAT'S ONE CONCERT.

04:58:41.803 --> 04:58:43.805

GREAT SOLUTION TO A DRUG

04:58:59.154 --> 04:59:01.523
PROBLEM. SO I DID A LOT OF PROP

THIRTY SIX WAS. THAT THERE WAS

04:59:08.230 --> 04:59:09.898

RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC- AS FAR

06:05:26.871 --> 06:05:28.706
AS THE INVOICE THAT WAS USED TO

06:05:28.773 --> 06:05:32.076
JUSTIFY THIS BILL- MY

06:05:32.143 --> 06:05:33.544
UNDERSTANDING AND TALKING WITH

06:05:33.611 --> 06:05:36.281
THE PUBLISHER OF THE NEWSPAPER.

06:05:36.347 --> 06:05:37.215
IS THAT THAT AD WAS NEVER

06:06:05.910 --> 06:06:08.279

06:48:48.770 --> 06:48:50.572
PAYS VERY LITTLE AND THERE'S

06:48:50.639 --> 06:48:53.208
BEEN NATIONALLY. FIVE THESE

06:48:53.275 --> 06:48:54.810
FIRE. IN THIS PART CAMP GET

06:48:54.877 --> 06:48:56.745
PAID ABOUT I THINK IT WAS LIKE

06:48:56.812 --> 06:48:58.447
A DOLLAR FIFTY A DAY SOMETHING

06:48:58.513 --> 06:49:00.816
LIKE THAT- AND I THINK THAT WE

06:49:00.883 --> 06:49:03.585
NEED TO CONSIDER HOW WE USE THE

06:49:03.652 --> 06:49:05.821
INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE. AS A WAY

06:49:05.888 --> 06:49:07.189
TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY AND

06:49:07.256 --> 06:49:10.392
RESOURCES ONCE- FOLKS ARE OUT

06:49:10.459 --> 06:49:11.760
SO I THINK THE QUESTIONS THAT

06:49:11.827 --> 06:49:13.595
ARE- THAT HAVE ARISEN TO VALID

06:49:13.662 --> 06:49:16.999
IN TERMS OF. TRYING TO- CREATE

06:49:17.065 --> 06:49:23.005
LANGUAGE AND- ASSURANCE. THAT

06:49:23.071 --> 06:49:24.873
PEOPLE CAN BE SAFE I THINK AT

06:49:24.940 --> 06:49:25.440
THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S A

06:49:25.507 --> 06:49:27.676
LOT OF PUBLIC SAFETY- QUESTIONS

06:49:27.743 --> 06:49:29.745
THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. BUT I

06:49:29.811 --> 06:49:30.445
THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS A

06:49:30.512 --> 06:49:32.281
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND

06:49:32.347 --> 06:49:33.582

HABEAS PROCEEDING AFTER THERE'S

07:38:11.964 --> 07:38:13.432

MEMBERS. DECEMBER MR LACKEY HAS

07:38:39.358 --> 07:38:42.761
A QUESTION. YEAH I REALLY HAVE

07:38:42.828 --> 07:38:43.996
TROUBLE WITH THE AMBIGUITY

07:38:44.063 --> 07:38:46.532
PIECE ON THE DEFINITION I THINK

07:38:46.599 --> 07:38:49.501
IT'S FAIR NO ONE WANTS TO. HOLD

07:38:49.568 --> 07:38:51.370
SOMEBODY ACCOUNT HAS A TRUE

07:38:51.437 --> 07:38:53.706
ELECTION DISABILITY. BUT I'M

07:38:53.772 --> 07:38:54.807
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HOW MUCH

07:38:54.874 --> 07:38:55.808
COULD BE INTERPRETED BY THE

07:38:55.875 --> 07:38:58.544
COURTS ARE NO WE JUST HEARD A-

07:38:58.611 --> 07:39:01.680
VERY- POWERFUL. DESCRIPTION OF

07:39:01.747 --> 07:39:05.017
OPPOSITION. WHEN SHE PRESENTED

07:39:05.084 --> 07:39:06.685
ATKINS VERSUS VIRGINIA I DON'T

07:39:06.752 --> 07:39:08.687
NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THOSE

07:39:08.754 --> 07:39:12.725
PER CAR. BUT THE CLEARLY THERE

07:39:12.791 --> 07:39:14.627
SEEMS TO BE. THE MEMBER UNION

07:39:14.693 --> 07:39:17.029
WHAT WHAT THIS MEANS ACT AND AN

07:39:17.096 --> 07:39:18.430
OFFER GOES TO BE TO BROUGHT I

07:39:18.497 --> 07:39:20.966
THINK WE DEFEAT WHAT THE

07:39:21.033 --> 07:39:23.035
ATTENTION AS INTENTIONAL- HAS A

07:39:23.102 --> 07:39:27.072
REAL. DISABILITY A RECORD USING

07:39:27.139 --> 07:39:29.942
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND RIGHT FROM

07:39:30.009 --> 07:39:33.712
TIMES OF AND I THINK THAT NOT.

07:39:33.779 --> 07:39:35.614
TO SEE ANYWHERE. PUT TO THAT

07:39:35.681 --> 07:39:36.815
HAS A THAT DIFFICULTY MAKING

07:39:36.882 --> 07:39:38.350
THOSE DETERMINATIONS. HOWEVER

07:39:38.417 --> 07:39:41.387
THERE'S IF THE IF IT GOES

07:39:41.453 --> 07:39:43.355
BEYOND ITS INTENTION THEN IT

07:39:43.422 --> 07:39:45.157
BECOMES A DISSERVICE AND

07:39:45.224 --> 07:39:46.859
BECOMES QUESTIONABLE AS FAR AS

07:39:46.926 --> 07:39:48.827
IT ARRIVING AT JUSTICES SO I'D

07:39:48.894 --> 07:39:51.096
LIKE TO HEAR WHAT ADDRESS

07:39:51.163 --> 07:39:52.631
ABSOLUTELY CERTAINTY ON THAT

07:39:52.698 --> 07:39:54.333
ISSUE YEAH IT'S A IT'S A LITTLE

07:39:54.400 --> 07:39:55.901
ASTONISHING TO HEAR THAT

07:39:55.968 --> 07:39:58.170
TESTIMONY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A

07:39:58.237 --> 07:40:00.105
DOING ATKINS THIS IS BASED ON

07:40:00.172 --> 07:40:02.741
ATKINS AMERICANS DECISION. AND

07:40:02.808 --> 07:40:04.977
WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID

07:40:05.044 --> 07:40:07.079
IS THAT THE STATE'S NEED TO

07:40:07.146 --> 07:40:08.781
KEEP UP WITH THE DEBT THAT SORT

07:40:08.847 --> 07:40:10.482
OF DEFINITION THAT CLINICAL

07:40:10.549 --> 07:40:12.117
CLINICAL DEFINITION OF

07:40:12.184 --> 07:40:13.619
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY THAT'S

07:40:13.686 --> 07:40:15.387
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING SO WE

07:40:15.454 --> 07:40:18.891
RELY ON THE CALIFORNIA STATUTE

07:40:18.958 --> 07:40:19.758
SAID BEEN EXISTENCE FOR DECADES.

07:40:19.825 --> 07:40:21.293
CLINICAL STANDARDS HAVE CHANGED

07:40:21.360 --> 07:40:22.962
THAT'S WHY WORKING THIS TO THE

07:40:23.028 --> 07:40:24.596
CURRENT STANDARD WHICH IS THE

07:40:24.663 --> 07:40:27.066
DSM FIVE. SO THAT'S ACTUALLY

07:40:27.132 --> 07:40:28.534
VERY CLEAR NOW THE

07:40:28.600 --> 07:40:31.470
DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD. IS UP TO

07:40:31.537 --> 07:40:32.571

DOESN'T ADDED EIGHTEEN THAT'S

07:40:40.579 --> 07:40:42.247

07:40:48.320 --> 07:40:49.021
LINE OF THINKING IN THIS WHOLE

07:40:49.088 --> 07:40:52.825
POLICY TO WORK CURRENT. MENTAL

07:40:52.891 --> 07:40:54.893

IT WHEN IT SOMEBODY IS. IT WILL

07:41:15.514 --> 07:41:17.416
BE DIVERTED AS A AS A JUVENILE.

07:41:17.483 --> 07:41:19.818
UP TO TWENTY FIVE IF IT'S CLEAR

07:41:19.885 --> 07:41:20.986

EVEN 24% OF UNEMPLOYMENT. AND

08:03:56.707 --> 08:03:58.175
SO FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE

OF THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED.

08:04:03.080 --> 08:04:05.116

ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT

08:04:17.128 --> 08:04:18.496
SPOKE ABOUT HAVING TO TRAVEL

08:04:18.562 --> 08:04:20.865
LONG DISTANCES. AND SO IF THE

PAROLE OFFICER IS WITHIN A

CERTAIN REGION IN A PAROLE LEE

IS WITHIN A CERTAIN REGION

08:04:25.503 --> 08:04:27.271
WHERE THERE IS NO WORK. WHAT

08:04:27.338 --> 08:04:28.305
ARE SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS

08:04:28.372 --> 08:04:30.074
THAT YOU MAY HAVE ON HOW WE CAN

08:04:30.141 --> 08:04:31.809

OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT WE

08:04:32.977 --> 08:04:35.179
FACE AND THAT'S REALLY ACCESS

08:04:35.246 --> 08:04:41.719
TO A JOB. YOU HAVE BUT THAT.

08:04:41.786 --> 08:04:43.254
AND QUITE A FEW QUESTION.

08:04:43.320 --> 08:04:44.789
ROLLED UP IN THERE I'D I'D

08:04:44.855 --> 08:04:46.390
START BY THING AND WITH WHAT

08:04:46.457 --> 08:04:50.327
THE- WHAT ARE POLL FOLKS NEED.

08:04:50.394 --> 08:04:52.096
MOST IS THAT AND I THINK SOME

08:04:52.163 --> 08:04:53.330
OF WHICH IS ACTUALLY CONTAINED

08:04:53.397 --> 08:04:55.366
IN THE BILL BOTH CASELOAD CAPS

08:04:55.433 --> 08:04:57.201
WILL DEFINITELY ALLOW OUR

08:04:57.268 --> 08:05:00.504
PATROL AGENT TO- BETTER

08:05:00.571 --> 08:05:02.673
FACILITATE SERVICES BECAUSE

08:05:02.740 --> 08:05:04.241
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO BETTER

08:05:04.308 --> 08:05:06.744
MANAGE THEIR CASELOADS- RIGHT

08:05:06.811 --> 08:05:08.512
NOW THEY'RE JUST SO OVERWHELMED

08:05:08.579 --> 08:05:10.614
THERE'S VERY LIMITED TIME

08:05:10.681 --> 08:05:14.385
AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY- TO

08:05:14.452 --> 08:05:17.555
ACTUALLY. BEEN TIME DEDICATED

08:05:17.621 --> 08:05:19.290
TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND SPEAKING

08:05:19.356 --> 08:05:20.858
OUT SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

08:05:20.925 --> 08:05:24.762
SECONDLY. I KNOW THAT YOU OVER

08:05:24.829 --> 08:05:25.396
THE LOT AT THE DECADE SERVICES

08:05:25.463 --> 08:05:29.099
HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY. PRODUCED

08:05:29.166 --> 08:05:31.035
AND CUT RIGHT UP IN MANY AREAS

08:05:31.101 --> 08:05:32.403
AND SO THE ACT THAT YOU

08:05:32.470 --> 08:05:34.772
SERVICES HAS REALLY DWINDLE-

08:05:34.839 --> 08:05:36.173
AND SO I THINK ADDITIONAL

08:05:36.240 --> 08:05:38.976
FUNDING FOR ACTUAL COMMUNITY

08:05:39.043 --> 08:05:43.414

HELPFULNESS THAT NEED. AS FAR

08:05:52.890 --> 08:05:55.326
AS THAT JOHN BEING AVAILABLE A

08:05:55.392 --> 08:05:57.728
PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC REGION I

08:05:57.795 --> 08:05:59.864
KNOW THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY

08:05:59.930 --> 08:06:01.632
PROPERTIES AVAILABLE NOW IN

08:06:01.699 --> 08:06:02.766
ORDER TO BE GRANTED TRAVEL

08:06:02.833 --> 08:06:04.335
PASSES FOR PAROLEES SO THAT

08:06:04.401 --> 08:06:05.703
THEY CAN TRAVEL OUTSIDETHE

08:06:05.769 --> 08:06:08.739
RESTRICTED REGION UP FOR

08:06:08.806 --> 08:06:11.675
SOMETHING LIKE A JOB. SECONDLY

08:06:11.742 --> 08:06:13.644

SCHOOL EDUCATION AND THINGS

08:06:28.559 --> 08:06:31.295
LIKE THAT SO I THINK THERE ARE

08:06:31.362 --> 08:06:32.997
OTHER MECHANISMS. BUT REALLY

08:06:33.063 --> 08:06:36.700
FUNDING. FUNDING FOR THOSE

08:06:36.767 --> 08:06:38.068
LOCAL SERVICES INCLUDING

08:07:01.926 --> 08:07:03.260
THERE IS NO INCREASE IN

08:07:03.327 --> 08:07:06.964
BUDGETS. AND PAROLEES HAVE A

08:07:07.031 --> 08:07:10.501
HISTORY OF GOOD BEHAVIOR FOR

08:07:10.568 --> 08:07:11.135

LONGER NEED TO BE ON PAROLE.

08:07:19.777 --> 08:07:20.644
THEN WHY SHOUL THEY BE ON

PAROLE WHY DON'T WE ALLEVIATE

08:07:22.646 --> 08:07:24.348
SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES FOR

PAROLE OFFICERS TO ACTUALLY

08:07:25.816 --> 08:07:27.017
CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK

AND TO. BE JUDGED BASED ON

08:07:36.694 --> 08:07:39.063
THEIR MOST RECENT BEHAVIOR- NOT
