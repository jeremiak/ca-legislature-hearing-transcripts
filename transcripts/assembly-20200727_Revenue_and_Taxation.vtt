INCREDIBLY DE MAKES THE FLOW OF

00:59:44.847 --> 00:59:47.050
IN. A VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND

00:59:47.116 --> 00:59:49.052
SO A PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR EVEN

00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:50.887
HAVING THESE QUESTIONS I WISH I

00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:52.822
COULD HAVE GOT SOME ANSWERED-

00:59:52.889 --> 00:59:56.993
BEFORE- BUT IT DOES SEEM WHEN I

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.127
LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IS. A

00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:02.098
LANGUAGE. WE'RE DEFINING. WHAT

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:03.566
IS KNOWN TODAY AS REAL

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:06.769
PROPERTY. AND WE'RE FINDING IT

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:09.539
AS PERSONAL PROPERTY. SO THAT

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:10.807
IF IN INITIATIVE THE GETS

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.842
PASSED IN NOVEMBER THIS WOULD

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:15.178
THEN BECOME BECOME A BIG

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:17.780
EXEMPTS AND YET. EVEN IN THE

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.148
LANGUAGE ITSELF FOR SAYING IT'S

01:00:19.215 --> 01:00:21.150
ONLY GOING TO BE DEFINED AS

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:24.988
PERSONAL PROPERTY INTEL TWENTY

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:27.023
TWENTY FIVE AND THEN AFTER

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:27.590
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I WANT TO

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:28.191
MAKE ONE MAKE SURE I GET THIS

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:30.360
CORRECTLY CORRECT THAT AFTER

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:30.960
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE'RE GOING

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:31.961
TO IT'S GONNA BE DEFINED AS

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:34.130
REAL PROPERTY AGAIN. SO IT

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:35.698
SEEMS LIKE WE MIGHT BE JUMPING

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:38.134
THROUGH SOME HOOPS HERE- BUT

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.669
BECAUSE THE AN INITIATIVE

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:42.338
WASN'T CRAFTED APPROPRIATE MY

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.640
ON TO SOMETHING HERE OR MY

01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:48.044
MISSING SOMETHING. THIS IS ALL

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.479
IN ALL THIS IS A FORM. CARRIER

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:53.716
THIS IS NOT THE- IS THIS NEW

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.118
WASN'T HE BEST WAY TO DRAFT IT

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:57.787
I'D SAY THAT THIS IS THE- WAY

01:00:57.854 --> 01:01:00.023
TO DRAFT ITTOO AGAIN

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.791
MAINTAINED THE DESIRED THE

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.493
VOTERS THAT FOR THE NINETEEN

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:08.264
EIGHTY- YOU KNOW WE- WE DON'T

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.599
ALWAYS GET TO LEGISLATE THE

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:11.467
PERFECT LEGISLATION I THINK

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:14.070
THIS IS THE WE DECIDED- THIS

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:16.806
WAS THE BEST WAY TO AGAIN- MAKE

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.841
SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE WILL

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:21.244
OF THE VOTERS- THAT WE CONTINUE

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.712
TO SUPPORT A VERY IMPORTANT

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:25.314
INDUSTRY THAT WAS.

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:27.517
INADVERTENTLY HARM TO BY THE

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.585
POTENTIAL BALLOT INITIATIVE AND

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:32.088
SO THIS WAY- YOU KNOW WE COULD

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:33.723
DO BOTH I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.958
THAT IT IS NOT IT IS NOT A

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:39.062
PERFECT SOLUTION BUT VERY

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:39.829
RARELY DO WE HAVE PERFECT

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.064
SOLUTIONS IN OUR LEGISLATURE

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.632
ISN'T ENOUGH TO CAN MANAGER

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:43.933
JUST ONE ON ONE MORE QUESTION

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.935
IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO BE ABLE

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:48.504
TO ADDRESS THIS OTHER THAN- IT

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.673
WRITTEN AGAIN IT SEEMS PRETTY

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.941
SLOPPY TO MEAN- THAT WE WOULD

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:53.109
BE RUNNING A PIECE OF

01:01:53.176 --> 01:01:55.078
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS AT THE AT

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.579
THIS IS OR SOME OTHER WAY TO BE

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.381
ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF. THIS

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:03.753
PARTICULAR ISSUE. THEN THROUGH.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.488
IT WHAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.622
INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST YEAH

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:09.559
SO- LOOK AS AS A FORMER. COUNTY

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:12.695
ASSESSOR I ASSURED- DECLARE.

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.664
THE IN OUR FULL WAY THAT THIS

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:15.565
WAS DONE WITH MY FORMER

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:19.102
COLLEAGUES- WE DID CLOSE A

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:21.437
LOOPHOLE THAT WAS EVEN BROADER

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:24.340
IN- AB ONE OH FIVE SO THAT'S

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.242
WHY WE'RE DOING THE SB THREE

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:28.211
SIX WAR. SO WE DID FURTHER

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:31.781
NARAL WHERE. TO AGAIN ONLY. BE

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:34.250
CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSITION

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:36.385
SEVEN FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY- SO

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.621
WE DID THAT BUT IT BUT AGAIN-

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.123
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:42.992
ANOTHER WAY TO MAINTAIN A AND

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:45.061
THE WILL OF THE VOTER. FROM

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:45.661
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR SALT- SO

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:48.631
THIS WAS- THE BEST WAY THAT WE

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:52.668
COULD. WE COULD DO ABOUT STILL

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:53.302
MAINTAIN THAT CONSISTENCY. YES

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:54.203
WE DO WE DID EXPLORE OTHER

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:59.876

OFFICE. UNFORTUNATELY I THINK.

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.866
MY COLLEAGUE RAISES IMPORTANT

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:25.902
ISSUES ABOUT THE BOTH

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:27.069
INTELLECTUAL HONESTY OR

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:29.338
DISHONESTY- CONTAINED IN THIS

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:30.773
APPROACH ALTHOUGH I ALSO AGREE

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.442
WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT THERE'S

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:35.077
A LOT OF MERIT IN WHAT'S BEING

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.748

THE STATE SENATE THAT WOULD

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:53.062
RAISE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.997
DOLLARS BY BRING IN BLACK

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:57.500

VOTING THE BILL AND FRANKLY THE

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:48.170
SENATE SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:49.605
BANDWIDTH TO HEAR ALL THE BELLS

SOME CLARITY ON THIS. I THINK

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:21.637
IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE IT UP

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:25.341

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:27.195
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. I DO

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:28.763
ACTUALLY AGREE THAT THE SHOULD

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:29.364
BE METRICS YOU CAN SEE A MORE

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.765
COMPLETE PICTURE AND THAT'S

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:33.935
SOMETHING THE AUTHOR CAN

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:34.436
CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:39.040
APPROPRIATIONS. BUT. BECAUSE WE

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:39.641
GOT THAT IN FOR FROM THE TAX

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:40.475
CREDIT WE WERE IT TO EXPAND AND

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.710
WAS A GOOD THIS. YOU KNOW SO

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:43.945
THAT'S REALLY THE THAT'S THAT'S

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.414
THE ISSUE YEAH BUT WE'RE TRYING

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:48.016
TO CONTEND WITH IN A IN A WAY

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:49.617
THAT IT'S THE REASON WE CHANGE

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:51.686
THE RULES OF THIS COMMITTEE TO

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:53.888
MAKING- MOST OF OUR TAX CREDITS

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:56.057
FIVE YEARS. BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:57.125
HAVE A WAY TO REVIEW THEM AND

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:57.859
WE ARE ASKING FOR MORE

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.961
INFORMATION ON EACH BILL NOW WE

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:02.597
REQUIRE IT. WE REQUIRE SECTION

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:03.231
FORTY ONE SO THAT WE HAVE

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:04.866
METRIC SAYS WHICH TO MEASURE IT

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:06.067
HOWEVER A LOT OF ROLE TAX

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:06.968
CREDITS WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:08.937
INFORMATION AND THEIR ON GOING

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.805
IN PERPETUITY. WELL I COULDN'T

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:11.840
SO I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH

01:25:11.906 --> 01:25:15.410
YOU THAT WE NEED TO. HAVE EVERY

01:25:15.477 --> 01:25:17.579
EVERY PIECE OF DATA POSSIBLE TO

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:18.613
EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF TAX

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.448
CREDITS AND TAX EXPENDITURES.

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:24.185
YES I'M NOT STANDING Y. TAX

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:27.088
PAYER SPECIFIC DISCLOSURE. IS

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:29.924
IN ORDER TO GET THAT. HOW HOW

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:31.226
WOULD YOU GET IT. WOULD YOU

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:33.628
COULD AGGREGATED. BY TAX CREDIT

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:35.497
RATHER THAN BY YOU DON'T NEED

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:36.865
TO HAVE RATED BUT I THINK ACTS

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:38.233
ARTICLE IN THE END OF THIS IS

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.667
TO SEE THEM OF THE MOST

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:40.768
COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE IS THERE

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:42.036
IS THAT COMPANY ALTHOUGH HIRING

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:44.939
HERE AND THERE IS A LONG TERM

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:46.875
MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:48.910
TAX CREDIT. THAT I THINK WE'RE

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.512
HOPING TO GAIN AT SOME POINT

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:52.113
YEAH I THINK INDIVIDUAL SORT OF

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.716
LINE ITEM DATA IT'S VERY HARD

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:56.518
TO YOU ASCERTAIN TRENDS ARE TO

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:58.419
DRAW CONCLUSIONS FROM AND YOU

01:25:58.486 --> 01:25:59.954
ACTUALLY NEED AGGREGATE DATA IN

01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:01.823
ORDER TO YOU. HAVE YOU PERFORM

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.292
ACCURATE ANALYSIS SEPT I CAN'T

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:05.326
SUPPORT THIS BILL TAKES IT

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:06.794
FEELS TO ME LIKE IT'S MORE KIND

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:08.329
OF IF YEAH POKING A FINGER IN

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:11.766
THE EYE OF BUSINESS WITHOUT IN

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:12.400
MY VIEW KIND OF AN APPRECIABLE.

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:24.045
WILL BENEFIT. ONE HUNDRED. IN

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:27.348
ONE SO IF I CAN JUST A COUPLE I

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:29.217
THOUGHT THIS WAS- HAD BRACER

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:32.687
FINGER EARLIER SO MY APOLOGIES.

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:37.158
DOCTOR QUIRK. AT SO BUT- I'M

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:38.393
LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS HERE

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:39.561
AND IT JUST SAYS DEFINES GROSS

01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:41.362
RECEIPTS THE SAME AS THE FINDER

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:43.898
REVVING TAX CODE SECTION TWENTY

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:44.465
FIVE ONE TWENTY IS THAT THE

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:46.768
LANGUAGE HERE. THAT SAYS THAT

01:26:46.834 --> 01:26:50.071
THIS IS- GROSS RECEIPTS ON

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:53.575
WORLDWIDE INCOME. CAN SOMEBODY.

CAN SOMEBODY ANSWER THAT

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:56.110
QUESTION I JUST I'M I'M

01:26:56.177 --> 01:26:58.313
WONDERING WHY WE DISCERN FRIEND.

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:00.615
OF ONE OR MAYBE THE CONSULTANT-

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:02.417
CAN CAN ANSWER IF SOMEBODY CAN

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.485
MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER I GUESS

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:06.788
I'M I'M REALLY WONDERING WHY WE

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:11.659
DECIDED. WHY IT'S THE FIVE

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:13.027
BILLION IS THE NUMBER. AND IT

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.929
SEEMS SOMEWHAT NOT SOMEONE IT

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.464
IS INCONSISTENT TO THINK THAT

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:18.299
THERE'S SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:20.068
INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES THAT DO

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:22.370
VERY LITTLE BUSINESS HERE. AND

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:23.471
THAT WE WOULD BE GETTING ALL OF

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:26.074
THAT INFORMATION- FROM FROM

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.508
FROM THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:29.277
MIGHT ONLY DO A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:27:29.344 --> 01:27:31.512
BUSINESS YEAR VERSUS A COMPANY

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:32.614
THAT'S MAYBE BASED IN

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.983
CALIFORNIA THAT DOES- A LOT OF

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:36.951
BUSINESS HERE SO HOW DO WE COME

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:38.453
UP WITH THAT WITH THAT FIGURE

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:40.254
IN HIS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:41.623
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS- THIS

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:43.524
IS GROSS WORLDWIDE INCOME IS

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:44.726
THAT RIGHT. IN THE ROOM THREE

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:48.529
FEET YEAH INCOME AND FRANKLY

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:50.131
THE REASON IT WAS PEGGED AT

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:52.867
FIVE BILLION WAYS TO.

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.902
RESTRICTOR FENCE IN THE AMOUNT

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:56.070
OF COMPANIES JUST BASICALLY GET

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:58.072
YOU THE TOP TWO HUNDRED

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:58.906
COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:00.842
CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF GROSS

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:02.944
RECEIPTS. SO WE'RE NOT GOING

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:05.279
AFTER SMALL BUSINESSES WERE NOT

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:07.115
REACHING AND A- YOU KNOW.

01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:09.183
ASKING THE FTP TO PROVIDE TONS

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:12.086
OF INFORMATION- THAT. DOESN'T

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:14.055
IMPACT DECISION MAKING BUT

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.223
BASICALLY TAKES A LARGEST

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:17.291
CORPORATIONS. THE LARGEST

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:19.994
COMPANIES WITH THE LARGEST

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:21.663
AMOUNT OF TAX CREDITS. AND

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:23.031
THAT'S THAT'S HOW YOU GOT THERE

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:25.099
IT IT BASICALLY RESTRICTED

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:26.100
SOMEWHERE AROUND TWO HUNDRED.

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:28.536
COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA- MISS

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:30.705
RIGHT NOW SO IS IT THE TOTAL

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:34.075
WORLDWIDE REVENUE. I BELIEVE IF

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.044

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:36.978
I'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT GET

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:40.682
BACK TO. WHAT THE- COULD YOU

01:28:40.748 --> 01:28:44.185
GIVE WOULD BE FAR WITHOUT. YEAH

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:45.553

CHAIR- YOU COULD CLOSE AND I

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:18.386
ALSO WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT THE

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:19.487
SENATOR IS ACCEPTING THE

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:21.756
AMENDMENTS SET FORTH IN THE

01:29:21.823 --> 01:29:25.293
CANADIAN ALICE'S. WHICH YOU

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:26.260
HAVE ALSO REFERRED TO. IS THAT

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:34.469
CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT. CLOSE.

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.904

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:39.607
FOR THEIR QUESTIONS TODAY YOU

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:41.075
KNOW IT THIS IT HAS BEEN A

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:43.211
CHALLENGE TO FIND THE RIGHT WAY

01:29:43.277 --> 01:29:44.912
TO REALLY ANALYZE THESE BILL

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:47.014
ANALYZE TESE TAX CREDITS WE

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:48.149
HAVE LOOKED NOT JUST FROM OUR

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:52.220
COMMITTEE LEVEL BUT ON AND OFF

01:29:52.286 --> 01:29:52.854
BASIS HOW TO BEST DO THAT. AND

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.022
THIS IS. PLANE FIRST. IN THAT

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:56.657
HOUSES THAT WE REALLY DO NEED

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.826
TO TAKE TAKE- AT SOME POINT

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:02.130
TAKE A STAB AT. WITH THAT. WHEN

01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:03.531
MISTER BURNING COMES BACK TO

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:06.134

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.470
RESPECTFULLY ACOSTA NAY ABOUT.

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:13.174
LET ME SAID THAT. MORE

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.576
REFLECTING ON A VERY DIFFICULT

01:30:15.643 --> 01:30:20.281
YEAR AND. I THINK THAT SENATOR

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:21.883
JACKSON'S BILL HAD SHE TAKEN

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:23.785
OUT THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:24.385
BEEN A BETTER WAY TO GO ABOUT

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:27.355
THIS. BUT AT THE MOMENT THIS IS

01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:29.524
THE ONLY VEHICLE WOULD HAVE.

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:32.960
HAVE WITH THE CHAIRS THE

01:30:33.027 --> 01:30:34.729
COMMISSION WILL WAIT FOR MR NON

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:36.764
LOOKS LIKE HE'S COMING BACK TO

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:47.108
ANSWER QUESTIONS. I'VE BEEN.

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:50.578
ARE BETTER FOR THE- REVENUE TAX

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:52.814
COMMITTEE CONTROLLED ON THE

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.782
SENATE SIDE AND YOU HAVE TO BE

01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:58.820
THAT IT'S WORLDWIDE REVENUES

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:01.189
FIVE BILLION. AND WORLDWIDE

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:03.758
GROSS FOR FREE. TWELVE ONE

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:05.560
NEVER SHARED WITH ANYTHING ELSE

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:11.399
TO SELL. HOW NO I DO WE DID

01:31:11.465 --> 01:31:12.900
HAVE A COUPLE AND TO YOUR

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:14.101
COMMENTS WE DID HAVE A FEW

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:15.336
BILLS TO LOOK AT THAT WERE AND

01:31:15.403 --> 01:31:18.773
THAT IN THIS VEIN- BOTH BILLS

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.541
FACE THEIR CHALLENGES WITH THIS

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:23.110
COMMITTEE- AND I DO BELIEVE

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:25.112
THAT THE AUTHOR MOVING FORWARD

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:25.813
SHOULD LOOK AT SOME OF THE

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.882
METRICS THAT ARE ANY OTHER BILL

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:30.284
HOWEVER THE- MECHANISM BY WHICH-

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:31.152
THERE'S- I CAN ISN'T ANY OTHER%

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.653
BILL THAT. WERE NOT FUNCTIONAL

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:33.788
FOR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:36.958
SO- I DO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:38.292
AUTHOR OF THIS BILL TO LOOK AT

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:39.527
SOME OF THE METRICS AS THEY

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.128
MOVED INTO APPROPRIATIONS BUT

01:31:41.195 --> 01:31:42.530
THEY DO TH LIKE I SAY. LIKE I

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:44.031
SAID WE HAVE A LOT OF TAX

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:46.100
CREDITS THAT ARE GOING. USE BUT

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:47.468
NOT REALLY BENEFITING THE

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:48.135
COMMUNITY IN THE WAY THEY

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:50.238
SHOULD. WITH THAT I

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:52.340
RESPECTFULLY QUESTION I WILL.

01:31:52.406 --> 01:31:56.777

ATC AND I IT YEP EVEN THE

01:43:41.548 --> 01:43:43.050
FEDERAL LEVEL- IT'S BEEN AROUND

01:43:43.116 --> 01:43:44.518
FOR A LONG TIME- I THINK WE IN

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:46.720
INSTITUTED THE A. T. C. FOR

01:43:46.787 --> 01:43:48.622
MEMBER CORRECTLY MAYBE IN

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:51.291
TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY. SIXTEEN

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:53.026
SO IT'S STILL ROAD NEW IN IN

01:43:53.093 --> 01:43:55.796
CALIFORNIA- THE ONE THING I'M

01:43:55.862 --> 01:43:57.431
I'M WONDERING WITH THIS IS THIS

01:43:57.497 --> 01:44:00.534
IS JUST A STUDY BILL OR IS THIS

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.302
ARE WE TRYING TO SET US UP

01:44:02.369 --> 01:44:03.837
POLICY WITH IT BECAUSE THE

01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:05.539
REASON I SAY THAT IS IT BE

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:08.408
GREAT TO NOT HAVE TO FILE A

01:44:08.475 --> 01:44:10.010
EIGHT RETURN FOR THE LOT OF

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:12.379
PEOPLE THAT WANT ONE HAVE TO.

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:14.448
FILE A FILE IT TURNED PURPOSE

01:44:14.514 --> 01:44:16.783
OF THE EIGHT PIECE AS IT'S CRAP.

01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:20.554
IS THE INTENT ON PEOPLE WORKING

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:22.923
IF THEY WORK AND HAVE INCOME

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:24.558
THAN IT GET A REFUNDABLE CREDIT

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:27.060
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THEIR WORK

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:29.062
THAT'S IT HE C. SUPPORT THE

01:44:29.129 --> 01:44:31.498
POSTED VIA. SOME DEBATE WE'VE

01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:34.935
HAD SOME TO. COUPLE BEERS

01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:36.536
REGARD THIS OFTEN. WHAT IS SELF

01:44:36.603 --> 01:44:38.105
EMPLOYED SHE GETS AND YET C. OR

01:44:38.171 --> 01:44:40.440
NOT WOULD. IT ARE THE IS THAT

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:41.908
GONNA BE STUDIED IN THIS- THAT

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:43.010
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SELF

01:44:43.076 --> 01:44:45.045
EMPLOYED WHO DON'T HAVE TEN

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:48.215
NINETY NINES- WHAT DATE- GET A-

01:44:48.281 --> 01:44:50.217
A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT WITHOUT

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:52.185
FILING ANY. A TAX RETURN AS

01:44:52.252 --> 01:44:55.122
WELL SO YOU KNOW HOW HOW DEEP

01:44:55.188 --> 01:44:57.024
IS THIS GONNA GO. BUT AGAIN

01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:58.492
IT'S SEVERAL QUESTIONSIN THERE

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:00.327
BUT- IF IT'S JUST A STUDY

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:01.795
BUILDING- CASE JUST TO STUDY

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:04.297
BILL- BUT IT'S ACTUALLY SETTING

01:45:04.364 --> 01:45:06.533
POLICY- GIVING DIRECTION. AND

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:07.868
THEN I'VE GOT SOME CONCERNS.

01:45:07.934 --> 01:45:09.670
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- MY

01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:13.206
INTENT ORIGINALLY WAS TO. HAVE

01:45:13.273 --> 01:45:14.741
THEM FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE

01:45:14.808 --> 01:45:17.444
ABLE TO. TO DO IT WITHOUT

01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:19.746
HAVING TO FILE A TAX RETURN.

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:22.649
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:24.451
DIFFICULTY OF GIVING THAT KIND

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:26.420
OF DIRECTION. WHEN THERE MAY BE

01:45:26.486 --> 01:45:28.121
OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT MAKE

01:45:28.188 --> 01:45:30.257
MORE SENSE AND THERE WERE TWO

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:32.592
PURPOSES ACTUALLY ONE IS TO.

01:45:32.659 --> 01:45:34.861
ENCOURAGE THE SHARING OF

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:36.963
INFORMATION BUT DE BETWEEN

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:38.598
DEPARTMENTS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:40.333
INFORMATION ON. THESE

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.769
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:45.072
TO GET THEM THINKING. WHAT ARE

01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:47.474
THE ALTERNATIVES. THAT MIGHT BE

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:49.910
AVAILABLE AND HOW CAN WE

01:45:49.976 --> 01:45:52.079
ENCOURAGE THAT DIRECTION IT AND

01:45:52.145 --> 01:45:53.146
PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:54.081
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING A

01:45:54.147 --> 01:45:55.716
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:57.517
THE MILLIONS. TRYING TO GET THE

01:45:57.584 --> 01:45:59.720
WORD OUT AND THE RESEARCH THAT

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:02.422
WAS DONE BY THE TIPPING POINT

01:46:02.489 --> 01:46:06.226
COMMUNITY- WAS THAT DESPITE THE

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:08.195
FACT THAT. WE SPENT THAT MONEY.

01:46:08.261 --> 01:46:09.629
MANY PEOPLE STILL DON'T KNOW

01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:11.631
THAT IT'S A CREDIT AVAILABLE TO

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:14.601
THEM- OR IF THEY DO. IT'S

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:17.237
ENOUGH OF A HASSLE TO FILL OUT

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:18.972
PAPERWORK. IF YOU DON'T KNOW

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:22.309
OUR TAX SYSTEM AND THAT. THAT

01:46:22.375 --> 01:46:24.077
THEY'RE THEY'RE AFRAID DOING IT

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:24.978
THEY JUST DON'T DO IT AND SO

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:26.179
THE QUESTION BECOMES YOU KNOW

01:46:26.246 --> 01:46:27.981
IS WAITING IT MAY BE FOR

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:31.118
EXAMPLE. TO PRE FILL OUT A FORM

01:46:31.184 --> 01:46:33.120
THEY GET SENT TO PEOPLE WHO

01:46:33.186 --> 01:46:34.287
HAVE TB THINKS MIGHT BE

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:36.389
ELIGIBLE AND THAT WOULD BE

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:39.326
MAYBE ONE ALTERNATIVE BUT

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:39.893
RATHER THAN PRE JUDGING WHAT

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:42.129
THE ALTERNATIVES ARE IT'S A

01:46:42.195 --> 01:46:45.766
STUDY REPORT. HOW WEAK ANDEXT.

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:46.733
AND MAKE IT A FOR PEOPLE TO

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.002
ACCESS THIS THIS BENEFIT THAT

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:50.070
THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THAT THEY

01:46:50.137 --> 01:46:51.238
DON'T THEY MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT.

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:53.573
AND DOES IT INCLUDE A SELF

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.875
EMPLOYED OR WOULD IT JUST BE

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:55.842
FOR W. TWO. YOU KNOW IT DOES

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:57.577
NOT EXPLICIT IN THE LANGUAGE

01:46:57.644 --> 01:47:00.781
THOUGH MIKE MY READING OF IT IS

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:05.819
THEY WOULD EXPLORE EVERYTHING.

01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:09.656
AND YOUR COMMENTS QUESTIONS. IN

01:47:09.723 --> 01:47:11.758
OUR PURVIEW WE'RE NOT CHANGING

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:13.260
THE ESSENCE OF THE EARNED

01:47:13.326 --> 01:47:16.429
INCOME TAX CREDIT OR CHANGING

01:47:16.496 --> 01:47:17.130
THELANGUAGE ON BY THE INCOME

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:19.099
TAX CREDIT IS CURRENTLY PROCESS

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:20.600
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SEE IF

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:22.235
THERE IS A WAY FOR THOSE WHO

01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:24.471
DON'TAND IT'S JUST TRYING TO

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:25.806
SEE IF THERE AND IF IT'S THE

01:47:25.872 --> 01:47:28.575
BEST ALTERNATIVE TO HAVE- A

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:30.644
WHETHER IT'S A NO TAX RETURN OR

01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:32.546
WHATEVER THE POSSIBLE-

01:47:32.612 --> 01:47:34.347
IMPLEMENTATION WOULD BE SO THAT

01:47:34.414 --> 01:47:35.816
MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:38.518
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. SO

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:40.253
IT'S DONE A BILL THAT IS NOT

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.757
TING THE ESSENCE OF EARNED

01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:45.292
INCOME TAX CREDIT THEY ARE

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:47.894
CONTACT THE IS TRYING TO. SURE

01:47:47.961 --> 01:47:49.196
THAT ALL THE THAT ARE. ARE

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:51.731
GETTING. AND THEN THE THERE'D

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:53.567
BE A POLICY WOULD COME BACK TO

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:55.068
THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:56.169
IMPLEMENT YEAH I JUST WANT TO

01:47:56.236 --> 01:47:58.438
ASK MAKE THAT ABUNDANTLY YES OR

01:47:58.505 --> 01:47:59.339
NINE THINK THERE WERE NOT

01:47:59.406 --> 01:48:01.041
SITTING ANYTHING THIS IS JUST

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:03.109
THIS IS A VERY DO LITTLE LITTLE

01:48:03.176 --> 01:48:04.811
WORK. AND THEN BRING IT BACK

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:05.979
RIGHT US TO BE ABLE TO GO IN

01:48:06.046 --> 01:48:07.881
AND WHETHER WE WOULD SUPPORT-

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:09.816
THOSE ONES THAT RESERVATION WAS

01:48:09.883 --> 01:48:11.651
AND IN THE ORIGINAL BILL IF YOU

01:48:11.718 --> 01:48:12.953
LOOK AT IT AND HAD NO EIGHT

01:48:13.019 --> 01:48:14.487
WITH NO INCOME TAX RETURN WE

01:48:14.554 --> 01:48:16.356
TOOK THAT OUT AND I BELIEVE THE

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:17.791
SENATOR IS ACCEPTING THE

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:18.859
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WE TOOK
