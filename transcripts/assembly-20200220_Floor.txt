SEVENTY SEVEN. MEMBERS WE ARE FILE ITEM NUMBER FOR HR SEVENTY SEVEN BY MISTER MURATSUCHI THE CLERK READ HOUSE RESOLUTION SEVENTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO WALDRON TO JAPANESE AMERICAN CONCENTRATION CAMPS MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED GOOD MORNING MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TO PRESENT HOUSE RESOLUTION SEVENTY SEVEN. AN APOLOGY FROM OUR HOUSE TO ALL AMERICANS OF JAPANESE ANCESTRY FOR THE PAST LESS THAN OF ACTIONS OF THIS LEGISLATURE IN SUPPORT OF THE ON JUST INCLUDE EXCLUSION REMOVAL AND INCARCERATION OF JAPANESE AMERICANS DURING WORLD WAR TWO. YES THEY MARK THE SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. NINE OH SIX SIX WHICH LED TO THE MASS INCARCERATION OF OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND JAPANESE AMERICANS WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN SIGNED THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT WHICH IS ISSUED AN APOLOGY ON BEHALF OF THE NATION. FOR THIS GRAVE INJUSTICE. SO STARK ACT OF CONGRESS FOUND THAT THE MASS INCARCERATION OF JAPANESE AMERICANS WAS NOT JUSTIFIED BY MILITARY NECESSITY. BUT INSTEAD WAS CAUSED BY QUOTE RACE PREJUDICE WARTIME HYSTERIA AND A FAILURE OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP. AND SO YOU MAY ASK WHY IS THIS RESOLUTION NECESSARY. THIS HOUSE NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S PAST MISTAKES AND LEARN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT ALLOW HISTORY TO REPEAT ITSELF. DURING THE YEARS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR TWO. CALIFORNIA LED THE NATION AND FANNING THE FLAMES OF RACISM AND IMMIGRANTS SCAPEGOATING AGAINST JAPANESE AMERICANS. OUR HOUSE OUR LEGISLATURE IN THIS CHAMBER PASSED DISCRIMINATORY LAWS LIKE THE ALIEN LAND LAW ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTEEN WHICH PROHIBITED JAPANESE EMIGRANTS FROM OWNING HOMES OR FARMS. WE ALSO PASSED SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION FIFTEEN WHICH AFTER PEARL HARBOR CALLED FOR THE FIRING OF ALL JAPANESE AMERICAN STATE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY WERE FEARED TO BE SPIES. WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS INSTITUTIONS PAST MISTAKES IN ORDER TO LEARN FROM THEM. FURTHERMORE THIS RESOLUTION IS NECESSARY BECAUSE WE SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY. MIGRANT CHILDREN FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA BEING HELD INDEFINITELY IN A FOR MORE WAR WAR TO JAPANESE AMERICAN CAMP AT FORT SILL OKLAHOMA. MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS BEING PROFILED AND TARGETED WITH SWEEPING TRAVEL BANS. CLEARLY WE STILL HAVE MUCH TO LEARN FROM THE LESSONS OF HISTORY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT ALLOW HISTORY TO REPEAT ITSELF. LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST THIS APOLOGY IS LONG OVERDUE. MOST JAPANESE AMERICANS WHO WERE IN CAMPS HAVE ALREADY PASSED AWAY. BUT THIS APOLOGY IS IMPORTANT TOO MANY CAMP SURVIVORS STILL ALIVE INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR HOUSE RESOLUTION SEVENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER VOEPEL YOUR RECOGNIZE. MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY SEVEN. AND THERE'S A DIFFERENT TAKE HERE WITH ANOTHER GROUP FROM THE INTERNET CAMPS. YOUNG SECOND GENERATION JAPANESE CALLED KNEES SAY. THEY FORMED THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SECOND REGIMENTAL COMBAT TEAM WHICH BECAME ONE OF THE MOST DECORATED UNITS OF THEIR SIZE IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY. THEY NOT ONLY FOUGHT THE GERMANS AND THE ITALIANS THEY FOUGHT RACISM. HEAVY DUTY RACISM RIGHT AFTER PEARL HARBOR THE HAWAIIAN JAPANESE FORMED AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE VARSITY VICTORY VOLUNTEERS TO HELP DIG TRENCHES BUNKERS WHATEVER THEY COULD DO FOR THE DEFENSE OF HAWAII AND OF COURSE AFTER THEY WEREN'T NEEDED ANYMORE THEY WERE DISBANDED. DIDN'T BOTHER THEM. IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FORMED THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SECOND REGIMENTAL COMBAT TEAM IT WAS COMPRISED OF TWO THIRDS HAWAIIAN JAPANESE NO THIRD MAINLAND JAPANESE NOW WHEN THEY WERE FORMED. THEY DIDN'T GET ALONG IT WAS WEIRD. MAINLAND JAPANESE NAMED THE HAWAIIAN JAPANESE BUDDHA HEADS. THE BUDDHA HEADS NAMED THE MAINLAND JAPANESE COULD PUNKS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SOUND THEIR EMPTY HEADS MADE WHEN THEY HIT THE BAR ROOM FLOOR DURING FIGHTS SO IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT. THE UNIT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE DISBANDED IF THEY COULDN'T GET IT TOGETHER. WELL THE STAFF MEMBER HAD THE GOOD IDEA OF SENDING THE COULD PUNKS TO AN INTERMETALLIC IN ARKANSAS. WHEN THE BUDDHA'S HEADS WENT WITH THEM. NOW THE WHOLE UNITS ALL WHERE THE COULD PUNKS CAME FROM THEY BECAME OF FIGHTING MACHINE. MANY BATTLES WERE FOUGHT AGAINST THE GERMANS AND ITALIANS IN ONE OF THE BATTLES AFTER THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SECONDED SPENT TEN DAYS IN HEAVY COMBAT WITH HEAVY LOSSES. ONE OF THE BATTALIONS FROM TEXAS WAS SURROUNDED AND WAS IN DANGER OF BEING WIPED OUT. THE FOUR FORTY THAT CAN SAVE THEM AND THIS WAS THE SAME BATTALION THAT A GIVEN- A HORRIBLE RACIST. GRIEF BUT THEY WERE ALMOST DESTROYED SAVING THIS BATTALION THAT'S THE COURAGE OF THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SECOND. FOUR THOUSAND WE'RE IN THE UNIT OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND ROTATED THROUGH. THEIR MOTTO WAS GO FOR BROKE EVERYTHING A ONE DICE ROLL THAT WAS THE SPIRIT. OUT OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND IT SERVED NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX RECEIVE PURPLE HEART SETS THE MOST MEDALS OF HONOR IN ANY ORGANIZATION. OF THAT SIZE THEY HAD SEVEN PRESIDENTIAL CITATIONS. THESE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD OF. HAD A GREAT GREAT GRUDGE AGAINST THEIR COUNTRY SERVE THEIR COUNTRY. AND FOUGHT AND DIED IN LARGE NUMBERS AND DID IT OUT OF PATRIOTISM AND FOR TRUTH JUSTICE AND LIBERTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER VOEPEL MS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY SEVEN ON BEHALF OF THE LATINOCAUCUS NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE JAPANESE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE MOVED FROM THEIR HOMES AND SENT TO CAMPS IN ARKANSAS AND THE WESTERN STATES. THEY WERE COMPLETELY UPROOTED AND FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES JOBS AND THEIR PROPERTY SEES. THIS DARK ERA OF OUR NATION'S HISTORY WAS RIDDLED WITH RACIAL PREJUDICE AND FAILURE OF POLITICAL IT OF LEADERSHIP. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUSTIFIED IN TURNING JAPANESE AMERICANS IN THE NAME OF NATIONAL SECURITY. THIS POLICY WAS CRUEL AND SHORT SIGHTED. RECENT NATIONAL POLICIES SPREAD FEAR IN OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES EXCLUDE SPECIFIC RELIGIONS AND ETHNICITIES FROM ENTERING THE U. S. AND PUT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN CAGES DETENTION CENTERS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK TO OUR PAST AND LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES CALIFORNIA MUST LEAD IN THIS ENDEAVOR AND SHOW THE REST OF THE NATION THAT WE WILL NOT STAND FOR RACIST AND PARANOID POLICIES THAT TAKE AWAY BASIC RIGHTS. FROM ANY PERSON. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF HR SEVENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MS RUBIO MISS FRIEDMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THIS MORNING I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HOUSE RESOLUTION SEVENTY SEVEN ON BEHALF OF BOTH THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HR SEVENTY SEVEN SHEDS LIGHT ON A DARK CHAPTER CALIFORNIA HISTORY. THE BUT THIS RESOLUTION GOES BEYOND THE INJUSTICE OF EXECUTIVE ORDER NINE. NINETY SIXTY SIX UNDER WHICH A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND AMERICANS AND RESIDENTS OF JAPANESE DESCENT WERE INCARCERATED IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS. THIS RESOLUTION ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THE ROLE THAT OUR PREDECESSORS IN THIS VERY BODY HAD IN SHAPING DECADES WORTH OF DISCRIMINATORY AND UNJUST POLICIES AND VIOLATED THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OF OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS. THEY WERE CALIFORNIANS LIKE MISS SU YEE ENDO WHO WAS FIRED FROM HER JOB AT THE DMV IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF S. C. R. FIFTEEN. WHICH REQUESTED THAT THE STATE PERSONAL BOARD DISMISSED STATE EMPLOYEES WHO MAY BE PROVED TO BE DISLOYAL TO THE COUNTRY. MS ENDO COURAGEOUSLY FILED SUIT AGAINST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT SHE WAS STILL REMOVED AND INCOME SERRATED WHILE HERS HER SUIT WAS PENDING. IT WASN'T UNTIL NINETEEN FORTY FOUR THAT SHE WAS FINALLY RELEASED FROM THE CONCENTRATION CAMP AFTER THE GOVERNMENT DETERMINED FOR LOYALTY TO THE STATE'S. RESOLUTIONS LIKE A SO M. CANNOT DO THE DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY OUR ACTIONS EIGHTY YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS WERE CERTAINLY COMPLICIT IN DESTROYING THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS. OF THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS DURING WORLD WAR TWO. HOWEVER WITH THIS FORMAL APOLOGY WE CAN TAKE A STEP TOWARDS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAT TRAMPLED OVER THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS. WITH HR SEVENTY SEVEN WE CAN ENSURE THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS LEARN FROM THE TERRIBLE MISTAKES OF OUR PREDECESSORS. AND THAT EVERY DAY WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR MORE JUSTIN OR EQUAL CALIFORNIA ALL OF OUR STUDENTS I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON HR SEVENTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THE STATE TREATMENT MISSED CALIBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOUR MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN SOME OF HR SEVENTY SEVEN- AS I OFTEN HAVE IN THE PAST WHEN WE WHEN WE OMMEMORATE AND WE- REMEMBER THE ATROCITY THAT WAS JAPANESE INTERNMENT- MANY OF MY- CONSTITUENTS. THEIR GRANDPARENTS- WERE INTERNED IN PLACES LIKE TULE LAKE ANOTHER INTERNMENT CAMPS- THROUGHOUT. THE STATE AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. THESE WERE AMERICANS OKAY THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO. EMIGRATED FROM JAPAN- BUT SETTLED HERE AT ESTABLISH FARMS HERE AND MANY OF THEM MULTI GENERATIONAL AND IT AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THEY'RE A MULTI GENERATIONAL OR NOT BUT THEY HAD BECOME. SICK SINCE. MADE THIS THEIR HOME AND WE SAID TO AMERICAN CITIZENS. PROPERTY AWAY FROM AND WE PUT THEM IN CAMPS WITHOUT ANY DUE PROCESS OF LAW. WHAT WHAT THIS COUNTRY DID AND THIS STATE DID NEEDS TO BE APOLOGIZE FOR A NEEDS TO BE. RECOGNIZE FOR THE ATROCITY THAT IT WAS THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. AS AMERICANS. AND THE STATE DID HAVE A KEY ROLE IN THAT. IRONICALLY IT WAS FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT WHO SAID WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF. AND YET WHEN HYSTERIA AND FEAR CAME IN ON THIS ISSUE HE GAVE IN TO IT. AND EARL WARREN YAHOO IS A ANOTHER KEY ARCHITECT OF INTERNMENT GAVE INTO THAT. FEAR AND MANY POLITICIANS AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT GAVE INTO THAT FEAR AND HYSTERIA. AND ALLOWED THAT FEAR. TO THEN TURN INTO TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S CIVIL RIGHTS. AND CERTAINLY I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALWAYS THINK ABOUT- WE'VE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT CHINESE EXCLUSION VERY SIMILAR. YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT- WE WOULD HAVE LEARNED OUR LESSON BECAUSE ONLY SIX YEARS BEFORE CHINESE EXCLUSION HAD AND HYSTERIA HAD TAKEN OVER AND THOSE- POLICIES WERE PASSED AND THEN- IN THE FORTIES JAPANESE INTERNMENT SO WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE WHAT HAPPENS THIS BODY IN AND IT IS RELEVANT. TO TODAY- THAT WE ALLOW FEAR TO GUIDE US. WE OFTEN DO THINGS THAT UNDERMINE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. AND I WOULD SAY WHEN WE HAVE A RIGHTEOUS FEAR EVEN WE MIGHT HAVE A RIGHTEOUS FEAR WE HAVE A RIGHT HIS FEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE. IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IF WE LET THAT FEAR. LEAD US TO UNDERMINING. CITIZENS LAWFUL AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WHEN LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. RIGHTS ARE UNDERMINED OUT OF A FEAR. OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS A VERY REAL ISSUE THAT MANY OF THIS BODY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. BUT WHEN WE HAVE A RIGHT WHEN WE HAVE A FEAR THAT LEADS US TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S PROPERTY RIGHTS. THAT LEADS US TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO WORK THE CROPS THAT THEY WANT TO GROW. THE CARS THAT THEY WANT TO DRIVE. WHEN WASTE WHEN WE START SAYING WE HAVE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR RIGHTS BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE TEN YEARS. AND WE USE HYSTERIA TO DO THINGS TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHTS WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS THERE'S MANY AND THERE'S MANY EXAMPLES THAT WE CAN POINT TO. IT'S ALWAYS RELEVANT FOR US TO REMEMBER. THAT TIME. WE DO HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF BUT LET'S ACTUALLY LIVE UP TO THAT MOTTO WHEN WE'RE MAKING POLICY LET'S NOT ALLOW FEAR. TO LEAD US TO UNDERMINING PEOPLE'S RIGHTS THAT IS A LESSON. I BELIEVE OF HISTORY AND HOPEFULLY WILL CONTINUE. HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE LEARNED THE LESSONS OF HISTORY AND I THINK IT STARTS BY SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION TODAY APOLOGIZING FOR THIS ATROCITY. OF THE PAST OF WHAT WE DID TO OUR FELLOW AMERICANS. MAY IT NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN THANK YOU. DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF H. R. SEVENTY SEVEN. WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE MISTAKES AND IN AND OF OUR OWN GOVERNMENT ITSELF TOO OFTEN WE CHOOSE TO IGNORE INCONVENIENT TRUTHS. UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE UNTIL THE PAIN HAS BEEN BORN TOO LONG ONE TWO A COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN BROKEN AND SCATTERED. WE OFTEN HAVE THE TENDENCY TO THINK THAT WERE PART THIS PILOT THAT WE CAN WASH OUR HANDS OF THESE MATTERS AND THINGS WILL BE OKAY. BUT FULLY APOLOGIZE INTO OUR JAPANESE AMERICANS WHO SUFFERED THROUGH INTERNMENT RECOGNIZES AND REQUIRES. AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING OF ACTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA TOOK. TO ENSURE THE INTERNMENT AND SUBJUGATION OF JAPANESE AMERICANS. WE SOMETIMES THINK THAT ORDER NINETY SIXTY SIX REALLY BEGAN IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO. BUT THE REALITY IS IT'S BEEN POINTED UP OUR MEMBERS. THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF ALIEN LANDECK IN NINETEEN THIRTY THIRTEEN. WAS FOR BIDDING OWNERSHIP OF LAND BY JAPANESE AMERICANS. AND IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THIS VERY LEGISLATURE ONCE AGAIN ACTED TO THE COUPLE AMERICAN CITIZENS. FROM THECIVIL LIBERTIES BY DIRECTING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THESE LAND LOSS WHILE JAPANESE AMERICANS WERE INTERNED AND ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. THE LAWS WERE THE RESULT OF RACIAL ANIMOSITY AND HIS. AND ANYTHING DO WITH SAFETY AND OF THIS NAY. WE CAN CONTINUE TO OFTEN DO THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BOB OF REFUSING TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES THAT ARE THERE THE DENIALS THE REFUSALS OF REFLECTION AND INSIST ON OUR INFALLIBILITY THAT WE WERE NOT THERE WOULD NOT RESPONSIBLE IT WAS OUR GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER SO MEMBER WHO DID THIS. AND YET WITH THAT KIND OF DENIAL AND DEEP EXAMINATION OF THIS NATION'S BIGOTRY WE FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THAT EXTREME IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WE DO. TO WALK WE DON'T WANT BE ACCOUNTABLE AND NOT BEING APOLOGIZING THE PAIN THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE OF THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS A NATION. BECAUSE WITHOUT DOING THAT IT SAYS TO THE FUTURE CHILDREN THAT WHAT TOOK PLACE WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A NEED FOR. THAT IT WAS FOR SAFETY REASONS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND YET WE HAVE NOT FULLY APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO RATIONALE FOR WHAT WAS DONE. OTHER THAN THE SOME BIGOTRY AND RACISM THAT EXISTED IN THIS COUNTRY. NO ONE RECOGNIZE THAT MORE THAN AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE PROBABLY BEEN THE MOST THE RATED IN YOUR THIS NAY. IN TERMS OF THE LOS THEIR FREEDOM THEIR LIFE AT TRY TO REACHED. LIES IN OVER. AND FIND STILL THE LOS COME IN THAT STRIP THERE BEING A MEMBER. TO THE AXE THAT. AND SO IT IS THAT WE ARE. THAT YOU WILL ALSO COLLEGES CRITICAL THE POOR. THAT THEY SOME ANOTHER YOU EQUAL A WHOLE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE TO NOT THAT THEY DE SOMETHING TO YOU IN ORDER FOR THEM TO HEAL A WELL AND DIDN'T REPEAT THOSE OF OFFENSES AND- YOU KNOW WITHOUT AN APOLOGY IS I SAID WE CINEMA TO OUT. TO WE DID JUST OF. AND THEREFORE WHEN THEY ARE FACED A SIMILAR SITUATIONS THEY WOULD DO THE SAME THING AGAIN IT IS A BIG PERSON WHO SAYS WE WERE WRONG. WE SHOULD NEVER DONE IT AND WE HOPE WILL NEVER HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. WHEN I GO TO SOUTH AFRICA IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING THE APARTHEID MUSEUM BUT AFTER YOU SEE ALL THE ATROCITIES THAT OF THE SADDAM THING MUSEUM TO. VERY END TRIP YOU. THEM TO THE IN THERE'S A ROOM. WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF ROCK. AND EVERY HAS TO PICK UP A ROCK IN SPACE VERY SIMPLE THAT'S SIMPLE STATEMENT IS NEVER AGAIN. REAL SIMPLE NEVER AGAIN. A RECOGNITION THAT THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN TO ANYONE FOR ANY REASON IN THE WORLD. AND IT'S AMAZING HOW- AFTER GOING TO THE MUSEUM MY STUDENTS ARE OFTEN IN TWO YEARS BUT THERE'S SO PROBLEM THEY PICK UP THAT ROCK IN A TOSS IT IN SAY NEVER AGAIN. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WILL WE EVER NUYS THE ERRORS OF OP STE AND WE SAY TO EVERYONE NEVER AGAIN. I MEAN IT. WE ASK FOR YOUR- FOR HR SEVEN. THANK YOU DOT WEBER MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER. I RISE AS A JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE STAIN ON OUR NATION'S HISTORY. THEREFORE IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE RECOGNIZE OUR NATION'S MISTAKES RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE PAST AND COMMITTED TO BUILDING A BETTER MORE JUST FUTURE. WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN PATRIOTIC AMERICANS WERE TORN FROM THEIR HOMES FAMILIES JOBS AND BUSINESSES AND THEY'RE VERY WAY OF LIFE. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO PEOPLE DIED IN THE CAMPS. THE HORRIFYING CHAIN OF EVENTS REPRESENTS ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT FAILURES OF LEADERSHIP. ELLER BY PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WHO ISSUED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER FAILURE BY CONGRESS TO INTERVENE FAILURE BY STATE GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS CIVIL RIGHTS AND SAFETY AND FAILURE BY THE U. UP IN COURT. IN ITS KOREMATSU RULING. YEARS LATER PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN SIGNED INTO LAW THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH APOLOGIZE FOR THE INTERNMENT ON BEHALF OF THE US GOVERNMENT. IN HIS REMARKS PRESIDENT REAGAN RECOGNIZE THE PATRIOTISM AND LOYALTY OF THE JAPANESE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVEN AFTER THEIR COUNRY TURNED ITS BACK ON THEM. SO MEMBERS TODAY WE ALSO STAND TO APOLOGIZE TO THE JAPANESE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND VOW NEVER TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST I ORIGIN I. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MR LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO FIRST OF ALL THANK OF THE MEMBER FOR TORRANCE FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORD- IS CLEARLY RECOGNIZE THAT REPRESENTATION MATTERS. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM SAN JOSE AND BORN IN SAN JOSE I COME FROM THE CAMP IN THE LEGACY OF. FORMER CONGRESSMAN FORMER SECRETARY TRANSPORTATION. NORMAN MINETA. FORMER CONGRESSMAN MIKE HONDA. WHO IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THIS BODY. MR HONDA WAS A MENTOR OF MINE AND HE WAS ALSO IN INTERMENT HIMSELF. AND GROWING UP IN SAN JOSE I DID NOT LEARN ABOUT THIS AMERICAN HISTORY. AND THAT'S WHY REPRESENTATION MATTERS AND THIS RESOLUTION IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. WHICH GIVES US SOME PAUSE TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION. THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHNIC STUDIES I LEARNED ABOUT THIS. NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL I LEARNED ABOUT IT WHEN I TOOK ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES AT THE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO WHICH THEN FORCED ME THEN TO SAY WHAT IS MY OBLIGATION AS AN AMERICAN AND HOW COME I DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT. AIR CAN MISTREAT OTHER FOURTH GENERATION CALIFORNIA. AND SO THIS RESOLUTION. IS A REMINDER THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO HELP EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITY EDUCATE THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. ABOUT THAT WE MUST REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO THESE VALUES. AND TO THE JAPANESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AN AFFIRMATION THAT WE MUST CONTINUE THE LEGACY OF THOSE WHO HAVE COME BEFORE US AND THAT YOUR WORK WE STAND ON YOUR SHOULDERS AND SO AGAIN TO THE MEMBER FROM TORRANCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR COLLECTIVE AMERICAN HISTORY. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE THANK YOU MEMBERS MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR HR SEVENTY SEVEN BUT I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING ELSE SOMETHING PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT. VOTING ON THIS APOLOGY SHOULD BE ONE OF THE EASIEST VOTES THAT WE TAKE ALL YEAR IT'S CLEARLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND YET THERE ARE SOME THINGS ABOUT IT THAT NEED TO BE MADE ENTIRELY CLEAR. THE CRITICAL POINT OF THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT THAT WE APOLOGIZE FOR NATIONAL POLICIES AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS. DURING WORLD WAR TWO. WE'RE NOT APOLOGIZING FOR CULTURAL RACISM IS FEAR ALMOST EIGHTY YEARS AGO. AND WE ARE NOT MERELY APOLOGIZING FOR THE ROLE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PLAYED IN THIS INJUSTICE. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE POINTED OUT WE ARE SPECIFICALLY APOLOGIZING FOR THE WRONGS THAT WERE COMMITTED ON THIS FLOOR. THIS FLOOR WHERE I NOW NOW STAND AND WE'RE ALL OF US ALL OF ALL OF OUR DESKS ARE NOW NOW SAID. HR SEVENTY SEVEN IS OUR RESOLUTION AND WE ARE APOLOGIZING FOR WHAT WE DID. WE THE LEGISLATURE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS APOLOGY IS OVERDUE. BUT IS NOT THE MORE DIFFICUT THING I ASK OF YOU AND OF MYSELF. IMPORTANT AS THIS RESOLUTION IS IT IS STILL JUST A RESOLUTION IT WILL MEAN NOTHING UNLESS WE LEARN FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES. IT WILL MEAN NOTHING UNLESS WE ASK OURSELVES THE HARD QUESTION THAT WE WISH OUR PREDECESSORS HAD ASKED THEMSELVES. IN ORDER THAT OUR SUCCESSORS ARE NOT LEFT APOLOGIZING FOR WHAT WE DO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ACTIONS ON THIS FLOOR. EVERY DAY. ARE TRUE AND JUST WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ACTIONS WE TAKE ON THIS FLOOR ARE NOT ACTS OF RACISM AGAINST OUR OWN CITIZENS OR RACISM AGAINST OTHERS FOR THAT MATTER. WE NEED TO STAND STRONG FOR CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES INNOCENT IT PROVING GO WE CANNOT STAY FOR IMPRISONING WITH MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN FOR THINGS THEY HAVE NOT DONE. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT INCARCERATION A LONG TIME AGO. THIS IS ABOUT OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IN THE PRESENT. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO SUFFERED BECAUSE OF THE ASSEMBLY IS ACTIONS IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES ARE NOW GONE. THEY CANNOT HEAR THE APOLOGY THAT WE OWE THEM. THIS STEMS FROM THE PAST BUT IT MUST GUIDE OUR ACTIONS IN THE PRESENT AND FAR INTO THE FUTURE. IF WE ACT JUSTLY IN THE PRESIDENT. IT WILL MEAN A BETTER FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA I ASK FOR YOUR AYE ON HR.
