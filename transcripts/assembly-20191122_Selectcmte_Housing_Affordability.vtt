AT ALL MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:51.669

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:52.269
AT CHALLENGES OF MOVING INTO

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:52.903
HOW SHIP YOU KNOW OUR OUR HARD

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.171
BECAUSE THERE CAN BE A BIG THE

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:54.705
COST OF A AND THE AVERAGE

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.540
MEDIAN RENTS RIGHT SO EVEN IF

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:11.922
THEN CONTINUE A IN AFFORDABLE

00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:12.556
THAT AND INSTEAD OF MOVING INTO

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:14.325
SHIP IN BEING ABLE TO BUILD

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:17.861
THAT EQUITY WHICH WHICH WE WANT

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:21.632
FOR PEOPLE AND IT DOESN'T TALK

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:22.266
ABOUT RATE HOW FAR PEOPLE ARE

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:23.567
HAVING TO DRIVE TO FIND THAT

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:24.935
MEETING COMMUNITY ACROSS THEIR

ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF.

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:32.276

ACTUALLY WORKS YOU CAN ACTUALLY

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:35.579
CUT. IT'S AN COST SO BUT I

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:37.114
THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:39.550
THE CONTEXT THE SCALE. OF

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:42.019
PRICES IN COMMERCIAL. AND WANT

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:44.521
TO KNOW IT IT JUST AND I THINK

00:43:44.588 --> 00:43:45.022
IS INTERESTING IN A FULL

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:45.556

FOLKS THAT ARE AT ONE TWENTY A

00:43:58.235 --> 00:43:59.703
100% AND I THINK WHEN AVERAGE

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.839
PERSON. MIDDLE THEY'RE

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:02.473
PROBABLY. REALLY WIDE BAND OF

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:03.140
FOLKS ALL THE WAY FROM VERY LOW

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:04.074
INCOME ALL THE WAY UP TO

PROBABLY. 50% AM I IT'S A MUCH

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:07.945
BROADER SPOTTED PEOPLE SO A LOT

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:10.481
OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN THE CAN

00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:11.081
BE AN AND ONE INTEREST JEFF

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:11.648
WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA OF

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.751
LATE AS- A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:15.919
JUST FIVE YEARS AGO WERE NOT

00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:18.055
MODERATE INCOME BEYOND. THE NO

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:18.689
FAULT AS INCOME. IN SOME CASES

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.524
VERY LOW INCOME BECAUSE WE'RE

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:22.092
SEEING MEDIAN INCOMES GO UP AS

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.928
WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF. IN A LOT

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:25.529
OF MONEY. THAT'S DRYING IT IN

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:28.465
INCOME UP AND WILL SETTLE. TO

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:31.969
THE BOTTOM AND. SO THAT'S

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:32.569
SHIFTING PEOPLE INTO LOWER AND

00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:36.907
LOWER INCUMBENTS. SORT OF.

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:37.541

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:42.312
THE HOUSING. SO THAT'S JUST

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:42.946
SOME OF THE DATA CONTEXT AT ING

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:45.015
AND TO GET IT TO THE SORT OF

00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:45.616
THE PACIFIC QUESTION HANNAH

YEARS IF I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:11.208
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AND SEE DID

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:11.842

THAT THERE'S PROBABLY. HOUSING.

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:38.569

00:45:38.635 --> 00:45:39.269
ISSUE FOR MIDDLE INCOME LIKE WE

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:42.005
CAN PROBABLY FIGURE OUT WAYS TO

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:42.639
PRODUCES UNITS BUT WHAT WE WANT

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:43.841
REALLY IS A BROADER RANGE OF

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.510
HOUSING TYPES. STATE WE SHIFTED

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:48.011

00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:57.855
TRIBALISM FOR PLACES AND NOW

00:45:57.921 --> 00:46:00.257
INCREASING THOUGH WE SEE IS

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:28.065
HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:30.067
THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT SOUNDS

00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:31.802
LIKE A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT UNTIL

00:49:31.868 --> 00:49:40.143
YOU TRY TO BUY A HOUSE. SO. TO

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.812
SOME WOMEN THIS POINT YEAH I'M

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:42.379
IT'S MY OBSERVATION THAT IN

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:44.481
FACT. THE PRIVATE DEVELOPERS IN

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:45.082
THIS BLOOM AREA REALLY ARE IN

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:46.750
FACT BUILDING TO THE HIGH END

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:49.519
OF THE MARKET THEY'RE NOT

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:50.153
BUILDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.988
MARKET I THINK THERE IS SOME

00:49:52.055 --> 00:49:54.658
OPPORTUNITY IF THERE'S A IF

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:56.193
THERE'S AN- DOWNTURN TO SET

00:49:56.259 --> 00:49:56.793
THINGS UP SO THE- MORE TO THE

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.695
MIDDLE OF THE MARK. AT ALL. GET

00:49:58.762 --> 00:50:02.499
TO THAT IN A MINUTE. ON THE

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:03.133
RIGHT IS IT WORTH CREATE OTHER

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.635
LAYER IN. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:07.904
GOOD IN THE ABOVE MODERATE

00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:10.474
RANGE OF A HUNDRED TWENTY TO

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.007
FIFTY OR A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:14.177
HUNDRED SAN AYE THAT'S WORTH

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:14.811
THINKING ABOUT I THINK THAT IS

00:50:14.878 --> 00:50:15.779
A POLICY IDEA WORTH CENTERING

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.848
THE QUESTION IS I THINK THEN

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:20.550
WHAT DO YOU DO. RIGHT YOU OKAY

00:50:20.617 --> 00:50:22.252
FINE YOU HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:26.723
RIGHT IN THE RENO PROCESS YOU

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:27.324
HAVE ANOTHER ANOTHER TARGET TO

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:32.028
HIT. IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT.

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:36.166
WHAT TOOLS DO YOU HAVE IN THE

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:36.867
STATE THIS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:39.836
ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE DEVELOPERS.

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:42.139
TARGETS I THINK IT IS PUT. THAT

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:46.176
IN A MINUTE. I THINK. TO THE

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:46.743
CRITICAL QUESTION I THINK IS

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:50.080
NOT NECESSARILY. IS THERE

00:50:50.147 --> 00:50:50.714
TARGET IN THE RENO WITH AS I

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.015
SAY IS WORTH CONSIDERING BUT

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:53.884
THEN WHAT TOOL DOES THE STATE

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:54.484
AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.286
MAKE SURE THIS STUFF ACTUALLY

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:58.188
GETS BUILT BECAUSE IN THE END

00:50:58.255 --> 00:51:00.424
AS YOU ALL SAID AT DINNER TIME

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.160
THE QUESTION HERE IS NOT HOW TO

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:03.794
PLAY I DID GO TO CREATE A GOOD

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:08.698
PLAN EVEN THOUGH THAT'S WHAT

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:09.299
TALKING AND THEY TAUGHT ME IN

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:09.866
SCHOOL IT'S HOW DO YOU. MORE

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:12.803
HAPPENING. ASPECTS IS THE

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:16.306
SECOND ONE WHICH. TING TYPE A

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:16.840
SECOND ONE IS THE OVERALL

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:20.710
PLYWOOD WHICH- WHICH I THINK IT

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.279
CAME UP EARLIER IS THE QUESTION

00:51:22.345 --> 00:51:23.613
OF TENURE WHAT TENURE WE SHOULD.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.249
ARE WE SHOOTING FOR MORE ARE WE

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:28.552
SHOOTING FOR RENTAL HOUSING AND

00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:30.053
FINALLY FINANCING HOW DO YOU

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.656
PAY FOR IT OR HOW DO YOU HELP.

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:35.659
HOW DO YOU HELP IT'S- TENANTS

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:36.259
TENANTS OR HOME OWNERS PAY FOR

00:51:36.326 --> 00:51:37.961
IT. GOING THROUGH THOSE VERY

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:40.197
QUICKLY. EACH ON THEIR OWN I

00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:44.534
WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:46.536
HI I AGREE WITH ON THE- THAT

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:49.773
REQUIRING FORCING OR OTHERWISE

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.307
COURAGE IN OF THE READING

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:52.075
COURAGE IN GEORGIA. LOCAL

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:54.478
GOVERNMENTS CONSIDER A WIDER

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.179
RANGE OF HOUSING TYPE IS A VERY

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:58.114
GOOD IDEA AND SHOULD BE

00:51:58.181 --> 00:51:58.648
CONSIDERED IN THE HOUSING

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.584
ELEMENT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.117
AN EXCELLENT QUESTION THE

00:52:01.184 --> 00:52:04.387
EXCELLENT ISSUE. AT THE EXIT

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:07.324
POINT ON THE SUPPLY QUESTION I

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:08.792
THINK YOU ALL SAID IT IS NOT

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:09.359
YOU'VE ALL TALKED A VERY WAS

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:14.064
ABOUT HOW THE. THE BARRIERS ARE

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:14.631
HIGH NEED TO COME DOWN THEY

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:18.134
HAVE DOWN IN MANY WAYS WE'RE

00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:22.138
THE WE'RE THAT TENDS TO GO IS

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:22.772
WHERE THAT HAS TENDED TO GO ON

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:27.210
IT GO IS TAKE A BREAK SINCE

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:27.844
ELSEWHERE FOR IN ELEMENT THAT

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:30.013
STILL PRETTY COMPLEX AND I

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.449
RELATED TO THIS TOPIC SIMPLE

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:34.084
FOR THIS OP OF A SAID I WAS

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:39.322
HAVE A SET THING THAT. SIMPLE

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:39.856
THANKS A IS ALWAYS REALLY

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:41.558
COMPLICATED. I THINK TRYING TO

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.860
FIGURE OUT HOW TO SIMPLIFY THE

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:46.329
INFILL REQUIREMENTS IS IT IS.

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:47.831
BUT THE LAST TWO POINTS TENURE.

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:49.866
I THINK OTHER THINGS HERE WHAT.

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:52.402
YOU REALLY GOING TO MISS THE

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.905
TOUGH QUESTION OF WHAT. IF

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:55.539
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:59.209
THE EIGHTY TO ONE TWENTY ENTER

00:52:59.276 --> 00:52:59.776

TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. HOW ARE WE

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:02.212
TRY TO GET THOSE PEOPLE BECOME

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:05.982
HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA. OR

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:06.650

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:10.487
WHERE I HAVE TO BE RENTERS AND

00:53:10.554 --> 00:53:11.121
IF THEY ARE PRINTERS HOW DO WE

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:13.490
HELP THEM DO THAT HOW DO WE

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:15.592
HELP THEM STABILIZE AND- IN

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:18.795
RENT AN ILLICIT SO I WOULD

00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:20.864
GETTING TO THE- MISSING. ONE OF

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:22.566
THINGS THAT WE- HAVEN'T. PLEASE

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:24.134
LET PAST EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.703
IN GETTING MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:30.507

TICKLING AND OWNERSHIP HOUSING.

00:53:34.277 --> 00:53:35.946
FOR EXAMPLE THE POSTWAR

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:37.914
EXPERIENCE HAS SOME RELEVANCE

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:40.550
NOT A LOT OF RELEVANT BECAUSE

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:43.820
THAT WAS LAND OF RICH LAND RICH

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:46.122
CHEAP LAND BUT- WHAT THE

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:46.790
FEATHER IN AT THAT POINT DID DO

00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:49.759
WAS CRY S. GREASE OF FINANCE

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:54.364
PROGRAMS THAT ALLOWED. HOMER

KNOW IT'S VERY VERY LOW.

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:03.206
PAYMENT AND I THINK YOU THINK

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:03.807
ABOUT MIDDLE TRYING TO MAKE

00:54:03.873 --> 00:54:05.208
MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING WORK AND

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:07.844
MAKE IT WORK FOR THE PEOPLE OF

THOSE INCOMES. MIGHT WANT TO

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:09.045
THINK ABOUT THERE ARE THE ARE

00:54:09.112 --> 00:54:10.880
THE IS THERE SOME OF FINANCING

00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:12.248
PROGRAM. CAN UNDERTAKE OR

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:16.286
EXPAND. THAT WOULD THAT WOULD

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:19.689
EXPECT THE BILL OF THE OF

LOT OF MONEY BUT WE ON PAYMENT

00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:26.363
AND SO THAT. THE SYSTEM THE

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:29.566
OTHER THING I WOULD SAY.

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:33.003
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT.

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:33.637

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:35.405
TO LOOK AT AMONG THE MODEL THAT

00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:37.574
WE HAVE SEEN IN OTHER STATES-

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:39.509
PARTICULARLY PROBABLY THE

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:41.211
PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS IN THE

00:54:41.277 --> 00:54:42.512
MOST EXPENSIVE MIDDLE INCOME

FOCUS ON BUT IT MAY BE THIS

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:16.579
POINT. BUT I THINK THE VERY

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:17.947
RELEVANT POINT ABOUT SELAMA IT

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:20.016

RETURNS FOR DEVELOPERS. THAT IN

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.089
A BULL MARKET. DEVELOPERS MAY

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:28.091
NOT BE SO INTERESTED IN THAT

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:28.725

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:48.050
IMPOSING A TAX. THAT MEANS THAT.

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:52.554
AND QUITE SUCCESSFUL DAY AND SO.

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:53.088
HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR CÁC I

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.289
THINK IT WOULD TAKE UP THOUGHT

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.958
ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:56.558
ON A STATEWIDE BASIS IT FEELS

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:57.159
IN A LOT OF WEIGHTS LIKE IT'S

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:59.561
SOMETHING THAT. A PARTICULAR TO

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:03.498
A BIGGER MARKET AND IS TO BE. A

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:05.701
LITTLE TOO BUT PERHAPS THERE'S

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:08.136
A WAY TO DO IT. I THINK WE DO

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:08.770
HAVE A ONE CITY RIGHT BUT IT IS

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:10.439
KIND OF THAT CITY THAT WILL

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:11.707
CITY MUCH LIKE THE PLAGUE SAME.

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:13.976
RATES AMONG THE SET OF UNIT SO

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:14.610
I THINK IT MEANS THAT THERE IS

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:16.511
A HOUSING CRISIS WE KNOW WE'RE

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:18.180
SHORT. UNITS IN THE STATE

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:20.415
DRAMATICALLY SO YOU SEE THAT

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:28.490
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT I HEAR FROM.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.092
CONSTITUENTS YOU KNOW WE KNOW.

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:30.692
THE NARRATIVE THE DOUBT THEIR

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:31.226
COMPUTER ONE MORE THING IN

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:35.931
THERE. THEY WILL YOU KNOW CUT

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:38.000
BONTA DISCARDED AND WE HEAR IT

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:41.036
FROM HOW BECAUSE. THEIR WORK

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:41.670
BUT DISPLACEMENT AND THEN ALSO

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:45.107
HAVE PIPPIN SEE ABSOLUTELY NO

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:48.944
SO MY PROBLEM YEAH THIS IS ALL

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:49.578
A BIG LIE IT'S ONLY. SHIRTS SO.

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:54.883
YOU KNOW WHAT IT. YEAH. WAS ONE

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:57.419
AND I AM IS A CASUALLY IN I

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:58.020

WHICH IS. RIGHT RIGHT DIVERSITY

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:25.814
PRODUCT. SOME VERY INNOVATIVE

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:26.315
STUFF I'VE SEEN ASSEMBLY

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:38.894
THAT TO THE. I DON'T KNOW BUT

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.797
MAKES POINTS. MAYBE IT TO WRAP

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:46.535
UP. IN THE I'D BE INTERESTED IN

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:50.105
WHAT OWNERSHIP THE CHAIR. THE

IS IN THE TOP. CUSTOM. RECALL

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.694
ABOUT HOW WE'RE USING. IS

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:15.931
INSTREAM- BUT IF THERE'S A SORT

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:17.466
OF GATE ON THAT I THINK YOU'RE

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:19.735

CLEAR BEST OF CONSTRUCTION

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:45.761
LABOR. PART OF THAT. SEEM TO ME

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:46.194
THAT ONE OF THE MOST

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:47.062
CONSTRUCTIVE THING SO I'M NOT

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:50.465
IN THIS THE STATE IS A WORK FOR

01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:51.800
IT BOB AND PROGRAMS TO

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:54.002
ENCOURAGE A- OF. CONSTRUCT IS

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:58.273
THAT EVERYBODY. I AND I THINK

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:58.907
THAT THAT WOULD BECAUSE I THINK

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:00.709
YOU'VE GOT AN UPPER LIP

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:01.343
PRODUCTION RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:04.246
CONSTRUCTION LABOR RIGHT AT

THAT THAT'S ONE THING. ANOTHER

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.285
POINT WHICH UP ABOUT

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:10.886
UNFORTUNATELY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.187

CONSTRUCTION IN NEW AREAS. IS

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:19.694
ONE OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE IS

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:20.295
A LAND USE PLAN ARE HAVING SAY

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.963

CAN BE. A TIME. I MEAN FOR AN

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:51.726
EXPENSIVE FRONTAL SAYS. NEVER

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:54.162
THE LESS THE RESEARCH DIED. YES

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:57.866
THAT IS A THIS OFTENTIMES

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:00.202

TO MIDDLE INCOME. THEIR SET BY

01:42:22.302 --> 01:42:22.803
GEOGRAPHY AND WEAKER MARKET

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:23.370
THAT'S WHERE THE REAL ESTATE

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:27.274
MARKET WON'T SUPPORT IT SET

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:33.547
LOWER. ALSO BEFORE THE HOUSING

YOU SEE SIMILAR SORTS OF.

01:42:42.756 --> 01:42:43.857
DIFFERENTIALS I MEAN I THEY

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:44.424
MAKE. THIS AN ICE MASON IS A

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:49.596
NEW. FOR ME I DON'T I CAN THINK

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:50.197
OF TO ME FEEDBACK ON THE OR-

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:50.764
YEAH I WAS GONNA SAY THAT'S

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:54.034
VERY MUCH. THIS IS FAIRLY

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:58.171
TYPICALLY WHAT WE- THE- BEING A

01:42:58.238 --> 01:42:58.805
VISIBLE DISABILITY PROCESS AND

01:42:58.872 --> 01:42:59.773
ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING THE

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.407
DIFFERENT HOUSING MARKETS WITH

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:01.775
IN A JURISDICTION AND THEN

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:03.977
ADJUSTING THE FEE RATES WITHIN

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:04.511
THE JURISDICTION BASED ON

01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:07.981
FEASIBILITY CONCERNS- THAT

01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:10.284
OBVIOUSLY THE BEST PRACTICE BUT

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:12.419
IT IS ALSO EXPENSIVE AND TING-

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.221
AND I THINK. SO I THINK THAT

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:16.557
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:17.124
WOULD CERTAINLY ELEVATE IN

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:23.096

HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:26.900
TYPICALLY PAYING FEES I THINK

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:30.571
THAT OFTEN WE FIND THAT THE-

01:43:30.637 --> 01:43:34.374
IT'S IMPORTANT. HIM IT WILL BE

GIVE CHOOSING UNIT OR- RIGHT

01:43:56.296 --> 01:44:02.636

01:44:02.703 --> 01:44:03.303
OF PRODUCTION AND AS WE TALKED

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:03.904
MORE ABOUT DENSITY THAT WOULD

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:05.939
SEEM TO BE SOMETHING WE SHOULD

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:09.242
GIVE SOME. TO OR AT LEAST.

01:44:09.309 --> 01:44:11.011

01:44:17.818 --> 01:44:19.052
SPIDER IS THE KEY THEIR

01:44:19.119 --> 01:44:19.486
INDICATION SYSTEM IS

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:25.125
SITUATIONALLY. YEAH A WAR WHAT

01:50:53.713 --> 01:50:56.516
BILL CLASS. I RENTER'S I DOING

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:57.083
THIS OR YOU'RE NOT SEEING A

01:50:57.150 --> 01:51:03.723
CHANGE. YES NO MATTER. BUT I

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:04.324
WOULD SAY THAT WHEN YOU FEED

01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:07.894
EITHER GONNA WRITE COST PRODUCT

01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:09.596
THIS CASE YOU CAN'T REYES WHAT

01:51:09.662 --> 01:51:11.364
PEOPLE MORE THAN A PEOPLE OF

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:11.931
EIGHTY FOUR ONE HEY SO YOU

01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:12.732
CAN'T JUST SAY I'M GONNA PASS

01:51:12.799 --> 01:51:14.934
THIS ON TO THE TUMOR OKAY

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:16.569
BECAUSE THIRTY SEVEN THE

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:19.072
WILLING HEY DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:19.939
YOUR YOUR PROP. WHAT IS OUT OF

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:24.044
THE VALUE OF THE LAND. AND. GET

01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:24.644
MUCH OF IT COMES OUT OF PROFIT

01:51:24.711 --> 01:51:26.012
WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE DEVELOPMENT.

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:27.947
MOMENT THIS IS PART OF ELEMENT

01:51:28.014 --> 01:51:28.581
YOU DON'T YOU THINK IN OAKLAND

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:30.183
IT'S NOT RAISING RENTS WHAT

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:30.817
ABOUT AN AREA THAT'S A NOT AS

01:51:30.884 --> 01:51:33.753
HOT HOUSING IN YOUR- YOU KNOW.

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:34.354
THIS IS PRETTY UNIQUE IT'S AN

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:35.922
EXTREMELY HOT HOUSING MARKET.

01:51:35.989 --> 01:51:38.324
VIEW WITH DOWN ON LOS ANGELES

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:43.696
BEVERLY HILLS I WORRY. THAT

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:48.368
THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN. BURBANK.

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:48.935
SO THERE IS A BIG RANGE OF

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:49.602
VALUES IN OAKLAND SO EAST OAK

01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:52.505
AND OUR OUR WEAKEST REAL ESTATE

01:51:52.572 --> 01:51:53.106
MARKET THAT'S WHY THE FEE WAS

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:54.207
SET AT ZERO. SO I THINK THE

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:54.808
QUESTION IS HOW MUCH DEPENDS

01:51:54.874 --> 01:51:56.509
SENATE ZERO WHAT HAPPENED. WELL

01:51:56.576 --> 01:51:59.679
WE'RE GETTING VERY LITTLE

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:00.280
MARKET DEVELOPMENT THERE. AND

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:00.880
SO WE CONTINUE TO SEE LACK OF

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:06.719
DEVELOPMENT THERE. YEAH I THINK

01:52:06.786 --> 01:52:09.856
IT THREE THAT. IS SUPPOSED TO

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:10.323
WORK BUT IT HASN'T IN

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:11.925
CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME SAID.

01:52:11.991 --> 01:52:13.960
DID IT SHOULD FLOW TO THE LAMB.

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:14.594
GO DOWN IN PRICE AS A RESULT OF

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:17.931
INCREASED CALL US.

01:52:17.997 --> 01:52:19.866
UNFORTUNATELY I AND AS IN ALL

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:24.204
THE CAN OCCUR THE NEW LANDFILLS

01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:28.074
SO THEY SAY AND SO. GOING ON TO

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:28.641
THEIR POWER TING ON THE LAND

01:52:28.708 --> 01:52:29.275
SIDE AND SO IT'S NOT REFLECTING

01:52:29.342 --> 01:52:30.043
THE WAY THAT THE MARKET SHOULD

01:52:30.110 --> 01:52:32.612
WORK AND SO THE ONLY WAY TO GET

01:52:32.679 --> 01:52:34.280
IT BACK. THE PRIEST CASA BY

01:52:34.347 --> 01:52:36.182
CREATING YOUR MUSIC TO INCREASE

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:36.816
SOME AS HIGH AS YOU CAN GET IN

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:38.418
THE MARKET THAT'S WHAT THE

01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:40.186
SENATE SAYS INCREASE INCREASE

01:52:40.253 --> 01:52:42.722
FRANCE. AND IF I MAY JUST ADD

01:52:42.789 --> 01:52:43.923
ON THAT POINT- I THINK IN

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:45.892
CALIFORNIA IT'S VERY SPECIFIC

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:46.526
UNDER PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THE

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:40.172
STRONG WAY WHICH IS THE

01:59:40.239 --> 01:59:42.441
CHALLENGES SPECIFICALLY THAT

01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:44.143

PEOPLE HAVE FORTY HOUSING- I

THINK ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE

IS A CRISIS OF. AFFORDABILITY

01:59:49.815 --> 01:59:54.287
FOR PEOPLE IN EXTREME POVERTY.

01:59:54.353 --> 01:59:54.887

BAY AREA AND CALIFORNIA. I

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:16.976
THINK INCREASING THE STATE IS

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:17.610
LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE I THINK A

02:00:17.677 --> 02:00:19.912
LOT ABOUT NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE

02:00:19.979 --> 02:00:20.479
LIVED IN SOUTH BERKELEY AND

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:24.584
NORTH OAKLAND. INCREDIBLE

02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:27.053
DIVERSITY OF HOUSING TYPES. IN

02:00:27.119 --> 02:00:28.120
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THERE ARE

02:00:28.187 --> 02:00:32.491
SIX HOMES IN THERE ARE COMPLEX

02:00:32.558 --> 02:00:33.125

IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:40.399
DIVERSE AND RACE AND AGE AND

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:40.900
GENDER PRESENTATION AND

02:00:40.967 --> 02:00:46.238
OCCUPATION AND NATIONALITY. ARE

02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:46.839
BUT MOST OF THE BUILDINGS IN

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:47.440

THERE I DON'T THINK A PROFESSOR

02:01:50.002 --> 02:01:50.569
THE UNIVERSITY WOULD BE ABLE TO

LIKE YOU SO MUCH FOR HOLDING

02:02:19.965 --> 02:02:20.966
HEARING HERE. IT'S AN

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:24.503
ORGANIZATION. OUR TRADITIONALLY

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:27.440
FOCUSED THE HOUSE FOR THE

02:02:27.506 --> 02:02:28.040
LOWEST INCOME IN THE BAY AREA

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:33.646
BUT- WHICH- ARE HOUSING FOR THE

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:36.549
MISSING MIDDLE AND A TREND THAT

WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING STATE

LEVEL HAS BEEN AT THAT LOCATION

02:02:40.219 --> 02:02:42.054
SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIES. ARE

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:44.256
MISSING MEN HOW OLD WHICH WE

02:02:44.323 --> 02:02:46.859
THINK YEAH. ARE ANY. BUT

02:02:46.926 --> 02:02:50.229
COMPARED TO THE LOW INCOME

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:52.298

HAVE A HOMES AT ALL WOULD BE

02:02:57.369 --> 02:02:58.804
HOMELESS WE THINK THAT A LOT OF

02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:01.941
THE PROBLEMS FOR MISSING MIDDLE

02:03:02.007 --> 02:03:02.508

DIRECT SUBSIDIES THOUGH THERE

02:03:10.316 --> 02:03:12.384
IS ALSO A ROLE TO PLAY WITH

02:03:12.451 --> 02:03:13.953
DIRECT SUBSIDIES WITHIN THE

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:16.088
HIGH COST OF THE STATE BUT

02:03:16.155 --> 02:03:17.823
FRANKLY MOST OF CALIFORNIA

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.992
ISN'T YET IN AS EXTREMIST

02:03:20.059 --> 02:03:23.929
SITUATION AS THE BAY AREA BUT

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:28.534
EVEN HERE WE- CAN DO A LOT MORE.

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:29.101
ZONING REFORM TO LOOK IMPACT

COMMENTS FOR. THE HEARING TODAY.

02:04:09.241 --> 02:04:14.146
GLORIA FOR HAVING. THIS HEARING

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:16.315
BUT WE HAD NOW A COUPLE

02:04:16.382 --> 02:04:16.916
HEARINGS AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY

02:04:16.982 --> 02:04:20.019
VERY VALUABLE- YOU DO SEE THEM

02:04:20.085 --> 02:04:20.653
IN THE LEGISLATURE ALL RIGHT UP

02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:23.789
TO HER TO TACKLE A LOT OF

02:04:23.856 --> 02:04:24.423
ISSUES. AND IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE

02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:24.957
WE- A LOT. ONLY FILL IN

02:04:25.024 --> 02:04:29.328
FIGHTING WITH OUR OWN LOCALITY.

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:32.097
SITUATIONS AND TRYING TO BE

02:04:32.164 --> 02:04:36.435
MINDFUL DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES

02:04:36.502 --> 02:04:41.240
AND DIFFERENT. AT ALL. AND

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:41.874
UNFORTUNATELY. WE HAVE SPENT A

02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:43.209
LOT OF TIME IN OUR STATE OF THE

02:04:43.275 --> 02:04:44.009
SPEAKERS MENTION SETTING UP A

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:46.512
ZONING LAWS THAT HAVE- NEEDED

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:47.146
TO WEAR FOR A LOT ARE RED. IT'S

02:04:47.213 --> 02:04:47.713
REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE IN

02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:55.421
OUR- AND. NOW WE KNOW HAVE THIS

02:04:55.487 --> 02:04:57.122
HUGE CRISIS THAT IS SOMETHING

02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:59.592
THAT'S HOLDING US BACK KLAY AND

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:00.626
CAUSING BE LIVING UP. AND I PUT

02:05:00.693 --> 02:05:01.093
WE BELIEVE YOU HAVE A

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.261
POSSIBILITY TAKEN. IF IT MAKES

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:08.868
A SOME POP. I JUST WISH. I

02:05:08.934 --> 02:05:10.836
GUESS THAT MORE PEOPLE SAW THE

02:05:10.903 --> 02:05:13.572
CONNECTION BETWEEN THEIR OWN ON

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:17.776
WILDERNESS TO SO MUCH HOW TO

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:18.377
LIVE A LITTLE BIT AND MAKING

02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:24.149
ROOM FOR EVERYONE AND I ALSO

02:05:24.216 --> 02:05:24.783
WE- ARE JOB. WITH THE DEMOCRATS

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:32.124
READING REALLY GOOD. HOLDEN I.

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:32.725
WAS I THINK THEIR JOB WITH THE

02:05:32.791 --> 02:05:36.295
BEAR. MORE THAN A- BUT YOU KNOW

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:36.929
DANCE USUALLY HAS CUT THE COST

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:39.899
OF OUR COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN

02:05:39.965 --> 02:05:40.499
ADDING TO COMMUNITIES I THINK

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:41.066
MAYBE GOES BACK TO A LITTLE

02:05:41.133 --> 02:05:44.904
ABOUT THE LACK OF ABILITY TO

02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:45.471
CREATE A VARIETY OF HOUSING

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:51.677
STYLE AND DOING IT IN PLACES

02:05:51.744 --> 02:05:53.445
WHAT MAKES IT INTO FOR PEOPLE

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:55.814
TO BE TO LIVE. AND WORK ALL

02:05:55.881 --> 02:06:00.152
AREA I. WATER RESISTANCE

02:06:00.219 --> 02:06:00.719
BECAUSE OF DENSE WE'VE DONE

02:06:00.786 --> 02:06:06.158
TEN. OFF CHANGE BUT I THINK

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:06.792
THAT'S GONNA BE PARTY EQUATIONS

02:06:06.859 --> 02:06:07.426
WHERE PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S AN

02:06:07.493 --> 02:06:09.528
UPGRADE TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD

02:06:09.595 --> 02:06:10.129
I'M NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND I

02:06:10.195 --> 02:06:10.729
WISH I COULD TAKE THEM OUT OF
