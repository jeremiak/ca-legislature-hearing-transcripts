A SPECIAL INVITATION TO DO SO

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:09.276

01:35:45.339 --> 01:35:46.707
ALLOWING THIS WHOLE DEAL TO MOVE

CONCERNED ABOUT HISPANICS

COMMUNITIES APOLOGIES FOR BEING

02:14:26.958 --> 02:14:28.260
ON THAT IS MEMBER BECAUSE IT IS

02:14:28.326 --> 02:14:29.895
A CONFUSING SAID OUR

02:14:29.961 --> 02:14:31.396
UNDERSTANDING AND AGAIN WE WERE

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:34.065
NOT PART OF CRAFTING ALL OF THIS

02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:36.468
BEEN HELPFUL AT THE TABLE TO HOW

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:38.136
CRAFT THIS WE COULD'VE WERE

02:14:38.203 --> 02:14:39.971
THROUGH SOME THINGS TOGETHER IF

02:14:40.038 --> 02:14:42.941
AT THE TIME IT WAS CREATED THERE

02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:46.545
WE COULD HAVE HAD A BOY THE BEEN

02:14:46.611 --> 02:14:48.914
STATE IN. AND THEN PUT THE

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:50.449
GRATED APPLE IS THAT KAISER WILL

02:14:50.515 --> 02:14:52.918
HAVE BASICALLY THE OPPORTUNITY

02:14:52.984 --> 02:14:54.786
TO SEE THOSE KAISER MEDICARE

02:14:54.853 --> 02:14:57.155
MEMBERS IN LARGER METROPOLITAN

02:14:57.222 --> 02:14:59.124
AREAS WITHIN THE INLAND EMPIRE

02:14:59.191 --> 02:15:00.926
WHERE THEY HAVE ALREADY. A

02:15:00.992 --> 02:15:03.428
COMMERCIAL FOOTPRINT 3% THE

02:15:03.495 --> 02:15:04.796
CLINIC INFRASTRUCTURE OR

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:06.398
HOSPITAL WHERE THEY ACTUALLY

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:09.901
REPLIED TODAY. FOR THOSE AS ZIP

02:15:09.968 --> 02:15:11.136
CODES THOUGH THEY'RE OUTSIDE OF

02:15:11.203 --> 02:15:12.304
THAT AREA WE'RE FOR YOUR

02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:15.140
DISTRICT. SEARCH OR THEY MAY

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:17.075
HAVE CONFESSED. THOSE BOXES

02:15:17.142 --> 02:15:19.077
COULD NOT CHOOSE KAISER BECAUSE

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:20.679
THEY DO NOT HAVE A CLINIC

02:15:20.745 --> 02:15:22.981
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT

02:15:23.048 --> 02:15:24.816
SO IN OUR SITUATION WE ACTUALLY

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:27.152
COVER THE ENTIRETY OF THE EMPIRE

02:15:27.219 --> 02:15:29.221
ALL TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE

02:15:29.287 --> 02:15:31.423
MILES NOW. THAT WOULD NOT BE

02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:34.159
REQUIRED BY KAISER TO FILL THAT

02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:37.395
SO THERE IS. THE SIX CONST

02:15:37.462 --> 02:15:38.630
THROUGH THIS TO IT WILL BE

02:15:38.697 --> 02:15:39.998
UNDERSTAND THROUGH THIS DIRECT

02:15:40.065 --> 02:15:41.533
CONTRACT IS IT ZIP CODE SPECIFIC

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.201
INSTEAD OF COUNTY SPECIFIC WHERE

02:15:43.268 --> 02:15:44.803
THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE REQUIRED

02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:47.439
TO SEE ALL OF THOSE FOLKS EVEN

02:15:47.506 --> 02:15:49.140
IN AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE NO

02:15:49.207 --> 02:15:51.109
GEOGRAPHIC. ACTUAL LOCATION WELL

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:53.979
SPOKE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HELPS

02:15:54.045 --> 02:15:55.280
OR NOT IT DOES BECAUSE I WAS

02:15:55.347 --> 02:15:57.516

UPON THEM IN OUR RURAL

COMMUNITIES AND THE LAST THING I

PICKING AS WELL AS- WHAT YOU

02:18:29.768 --> 02:18:31.403
INITIALLY BROUGHT UP. I THINK

02:18:31.469 --> 02:18:33.071
IT'S IMPORTANT AND WOULD LIKE TO

02:18:33.138 --> 02:18:34.706

TERMS OF CHERRY PICKING I

02:18:39.277 --> 02:18:41.146
THOUGHT WE HEARD EARLIER THERE.

02:18:41.212 --> 02:18:42.747
IS NO LOOKING AT MEDICAL

02:18:42.814 --> 02:18:45.283
INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR DEFAULT

02:18:45.350 --> 02:18:49.654
ASSIGNING A PATIENT. SO THAT 25%

02:18:49.721 --> 02:18:51.089
TO KAISER IS OING TO BE

02:18:51.156 --> 02:18:53.224
ACCEPTING. WILL BE DEFAULT

02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:57.529
BASED ON THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY.

02:18:57.595 --> 02:18:59.097
SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CHERRY

02:18:59.164 --> 02:19:02.534
PICK WHEN THE BLOCK. TO WHAT

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:04.769
THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY IS.

02:19:04.836 --> 02:19:06.604
INDECISIVE ROGEL WITH WHERE.

02:19:06.671 --> 02:19:08.206
WHAT I. IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE

02:19:08.273 --> 02:19:09.507

PERFECT BUT AGAIN IT'S WAY

02:21:39.524 --> 02:21:41.826

THOUGHT THIS IS A ISSUE WERE PER

02:22:12.023 --> 02:22:14.425
SE I'M NOT CERTAIN ON AND I KNOW

02:22:14.492 --> 02:22:16.661
SOME OF MY COUNTIES HAVE CALLED

THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT KAISER

ADEQUATE FOR CALIFORNIANS I

02:22:37.015 --> 02:22:39.617

02:22:50.194 --> 02:22:51.996
AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT AND NEED

02:22:52.063 --> 02:22:53.932
WITHIN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND-

02:22:53.998 --> 02:22:55.400
I'M EXCITED TO HAVE THOSE

02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:57.936
CONVERSATIONS WITH N. U. H. W.

02:22:58.002 --> 02:23:00.071

02:23:00.138 --> 02:23:01.539

THERE. AUDIT TO BE COMPLETED AND

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.812
THEY WOULD LIKE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:10.281
TO COME FROM THAT AUDIT BUT

02:23:10.348 --> 02:23:12.617
BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE GUESTS

02:23:12.684 --> 02:23:14.585

TO HEAR THOSE CONCERNS AND

02:23:21.192 --> 02:23:22.894
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN ADDRESS

02:23:22.961 --> 02:23:24.762

HEALTH IS. HI THANK YOU DR

02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:44.382
ARAMBULA- I THINK- ONE THING TO

02:23:44.449 --> 02:23:47.352
POINT OUT IS THAT- THAT SHORTAGE

02:23:47.418 --> 02:23:49.654
OF MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS IS

02:23:49.721 --> 02:23:50.989
REALLY IN A NATIONWIDE ISSUE.

02:23:51.055 --> 02:23:52.156
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS

02:23:52.223 --> 02:23:54.258
CERTAINLY BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:55.193
MORE RECENTLY DURING THE

02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:56.861
PANDEMIC US WITH SOMETHING THAT

02:23:56.928 --> 02:23:58.196
I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE HEALTH

02:23:58.262 --> 02:24:00.098
CARE SPACE IS WORKING THROUGH-

02:24:00.164 --> 02:24:02.734
THAT BEING SAID HOWEVER- IN THE

02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:05.136
PAST- FIVE YEARS AS AN EXAMPLE

02:24:05.203 --> 02:24:06.204
KAISER PERMANENT DATES ADDED

02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:08.406
HUNDREDS. OF NEW PATIENTS TO OUR

02:24:08.473 --> 02:24:10.475
STAFF AND WE CONTINUE TO ADD

02:24:10.541 --> 02:24:13.478
THEM ON A DAILY BASIS. AND I

02:24:13.544 --> 02:24:14.545
THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:24:14.612 --> 02:24:15.279
WOULD HAVE TO KEEP ON DOING-

02:24:15.346 --> 02:24:18.282
BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST. I THINK I

02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:19.984
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:21.452
TO HAVE TO FILL. I'M OTHER I

02:24:21.519 --> 02:24:23.087
AREAS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IS

02:24:23.154 --> 02:24:23.654
RETENTION STRATEGY THIS IS

02:24:23.721 --> 02:24:24.989
ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT.

02:24:25.056 --> 02:24:26.057
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:27.525
RIGHT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS

02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:29.093
IN OUR SYSTEM AND RETENTION IS A

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:30.561
REALLY BIG PART OF IT- AND

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:32.563
ANOTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT-

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:34.999
IS THAT ONE THING THAT HAS COME

02:24:35.066 --> 02:24:35.800
OUT CERTAINLY. MORE DURING THE

02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:37.869

THEIR NEEDS- I THINK I DOCTOR

AMULET TO THIS- I THINK- I DON'T

02:24:59.257 --> 02:25:02.193

ONE WHICH I CO AUTHORED AND WAS

02:27:33.644 --> 02:27:35.213
A BIG PROPONENT OF. THAT WHICH

02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:36.747
WAS TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE

02:27:36.814 --> 02:27:40.651
STANDARDS- BOTH FOR PLANS AND TO

IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE

NEED THAT TRANSPARENCY TO HAVE

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:08.412
THE ACCOUNTABILITY. CURRENTLY

02:28:11.882 --> 02:28:14.118
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THAT

DOESN'T ALLOW US TO HAVE THAT

02:28:16.354 --> 02:28:17.989
NECESSARY TRANSPARENCY AND

02:28:18.055 --> 02:28:19.223
ACCOUNTABILITY. IF WE'RE GONNA

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:21.192

02:28:24.629 --> 02:28:26.597
SIMPLIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM.

02:28:26.664 --> 02:28:29.000
WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL AGAIN

02:28:29.066 --> 02:28:30.901

MORE INVOLVED. HEY THERE'S A BIG

02:34:24.388 --> 02:34:24.922
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENCOURAGING

KAISER TO GET MORE INVOLVED AND

02:34:26.991 --> 02:34:29.126
REALLY. EASE OF LEGISLATION TO

02:34:29.193 --> 02:34:31.395

ACTUALLY DO IT RIGHT NOW. WHERE

02:34:33.364 --> 02:34:33.931
THE BASICALLY KIND OF TO HANDLE

02:34:33.998 --> 02:34:37.601
IT. AND THE N. MY MIND A FREE

02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:39.003
MARKET REACH BETTER RESULTS FOR

02:34:39.069 --> 02:34:41.372
EVERYBODY IN WHEN WE REDUCE OUR

02:34:41.438 --> 02:34:43.273
COMMUNITIES. ACCESS TO

02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:45.576
PROVIDERS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:34:45.643 --> 02:34:48.712
HOW THAT CREATES MORE CARE- SITE

02:34:48.779 --> 02:34:50.648
WITH YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT FOR

02:34:50.714 --> 02:34:51.448

BOARD THE CAN CAN DO THIS. WE'RE

02:34:55.052 --> 02:34:58.489
NOW KIND OF GIVE TO ONE. AND IF

02:34:58.555 --> 02:35:00.457
WE REDUCED PEOPLE'S POTENTIAL.

02:35:00.524 --> 02:35:02.192
HOW'S THAT CREATE MORE ACCESS.

02:35:02.259 --> 02:35:03.827
BUT I'LL START UP AGAIN AND THEN

02:35:03.894 --> 02:35:05.963
TOSSED IT TO DIRECTOR BOSS I

02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:07.297
THINK EARLIER WE HEARD ABOUT

02:35:07.364 --> 02:35:09.266
APPLES AND ORANGES AND I WANT TO

02:35:09.333 --> 02:35:11.268
MAKE SURE TO FOCUS ON THE

02:35:11.335 --> 02:35:13.771
INTEGRATED NATURE OF KAISER AS A

02:35:13.837 --> 02:35:15.673
PLAN. BY HAVING A PROVIDER

02:35:15.739 --> 02:35:16.907
NETWORK WHICH IS INCLUDED IN

02:35:16.974 --> 02:35:20.744
THAT THEY GROW UP TO THAT LIMIT

02:35:20.811 --> 02:35:22.279
WHEN YOU HAVE OTHER PLANS THEY

02:35:22.346 --> 02:35:24.481
MAY TAKE CONSUMERS AND THEN

02:35:24.548 --> 02:35:27.051
ATTEMPT TO BUILD THE NETWORK

02:35:27.117 --> 02:35:29.253
AFTER. WE HAVE HAD BETTER

02:35:29.319 --> 02:35:31.822
RESULTS WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THESE

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:33.757
INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND RESPECT

02:35:33.824 --> 02:35:36.293
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE UNWILLING

02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:38.028
TO GROW BEYOND THE CAPACITY THAT

02:35:38.095 --> 02:35:40.397
THEY FEEL IS. SAFE FOR THE

02:35:40.464 --> 02:35:42.266
ENROLLEES BUT WILL ALLOW

02:35:42.332 --> 02:35:45.936
DIRECTOR ASKED TO STEP IN. GREAT

02:35:46.003 --> 02:35:47.705
AND THIS IS REALLY INCREASING

02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:49.006
CAPACITY TO SERVE OUR MEDICARE

02:35:49.073 --> 02:35:49.973
BENEFICIARIES WITH THE

WHERE WHERE WHEN WE GET TO SEE

02:39:48.211 --> 02:39:50.414

IS RELATED IDEA ME SEE AUDIT

02:39:52.215 --> 02:39:53.617
AROUND MENTAL HEALTH. I THINK

02:39:53.684 --> 02:39:55.252
THIS IS- AN AUDIT THAT'S GOING

02:39:55.319 --> 02:39:57.554
TO TAKE PLACE- OVER A FIVE YEAR

02:39:57.621 --> 02:39:59.623
PERIOD- WITH TWENTY FIVE

02:39:59.690 --> 02:40:00.490
DIFFERENT HEALTH PLANS. THAT'S

02:40:00.557 --> 02:40:01.825
NOT JUST A KAISER PERMANENTE

02:40:01.892 --> 02:40:03.126
IDITAROD ACROSS THE ENTIRE

02:40:03.193 --> 02:40:05.228
SYSTEM. SO THIS HASN'T HAPPENED

02:40:05.295 --> 02:40:07.130
YET CORRECT. SO WE DON'T REALLY

02:40:07.197 --> 02:40:09.333

AND MEMBER SATISFACTION SCORES

02:40:16.673 --> 02:40:19.009
THAT CAME OUT OF THE OFFICE OF

02:40:19.076 --> 02:40:19.576

DEFINITELY HAVE THAT- AND I

02:40:20.610 --> 02:40:23.513

02:47:44.988 --> 02:47:46.289
AND CRIMINAL. THE REAL CHANGE IS

02:47:46.356 --> 02:47:48.658
REALLY NOT SO MUCH THE NUMBER OF

02:47:48.725 --> 02:47:50.326

02:48:25.295 --> 02:48:28.565
IMPORTANT. NOT NOT AND IT WASN'T

02:48:28.631 --> 02:48:30.633
