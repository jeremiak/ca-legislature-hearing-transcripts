00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:08.112
DIRECTING THE REVENUE TO ACTUAL

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.980
SITE CLEANUP WHICH WAS.

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:10.881
THE SHARED.

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:12.750
INTENT OF ALL THE PARTIES WHO

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:14.652
NEGOTIATED.

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:15.186
TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE OUR

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:16.654
PRIMARY CONCERN --

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:18.556
IS MOVING AHEAD WITH THE FEE

00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:20.191
INCREASE.

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:21.959
AS WE ARE RECEIVING ADDITIONAL

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.462
INFORMATION FROM CITY TFA AND%

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:26.564
DTS SEE WHICH WILL HELP.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.766
DEFINE OF WHAT THE REVENUE

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:30.301
BALLOTS WILL NEED TO BE GOING

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.937
FORWARD. TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY THE

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:34.672
EXISTING PROBLEMS BUT THE ONES

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.707
THAT MISS WILLIAMS ALLUDED TO

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:37.908
THE DTS HE IS.

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:39.276
STILL IN THE PROCESS OF

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:40.010
INVESTIGATING.

00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:41.812
AND UP AT THE MOMENT WE KNOW

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.781
THAT CITY TFA IS IS TRYING TO

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:45.816
DEFINE THE REVENUE POTENTIAL

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:47.518
UNDER THE EXISTING FEE STRUCTURE.

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:48.853
AND IT'S NOT JUST A CONCERN

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:51.021
ABOUT THE DISCREPANCY THAT THE

00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:53.624
ANALYSIS ALLUDES TO BETWEEN WHAT.

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:55.059
REVENUE IS BEING COLLECTED FROM

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:57.895
THE MANUFACTURER ACTED.

00:39:57.962 --> 00:40:00.765
FROM OTHER RETAIL FEE.

00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:03.434
IT'S THERE ARE OTHER ANOMALIES

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:04.668
THAT WERE TRYING.

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:07.505
TO UNDERSTAND AND DEFINE --

00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:09.173
THERE'S ABOUT A TWO AND A HALF

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.041
MILLION DOLLAR GAP BETWEEN --

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:13.210
CITY TFA IS REVENUE NUMBERS AND

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:14.912
THE PROJECTIONS FROM THE

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:16.847
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE --

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:17.815
AS I ALLUDED TO A MINUTE AGO

00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:19.383
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR AT THIS

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.585
POINT THAT EVERYONE THAT HAS A

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:22.920
COMPLIANCE OBLIGATION IS

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:24.155
REGISTERED.

00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:25.990
AND THAT EVERY REGISTRANT THAT

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:28.259
HAS A FEE OBLIGATION IS

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:30.227
COLLECTING AND REMITTING THOSE

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:32.730

ANY OF THAT MONEY ON THE TABLE

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.172
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT.

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:43.140
IT IS INVESTED --

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.975
FOR FOR THE RIGHT PURPOSES --

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:46.777
AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:50.114
TO UNDERSTAND.

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.315
WHAT THE?

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:51.816
WHAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THE

00:40:51.882 --> 00:40:53.851
DEPARTMENT CAN REASONABLY SPEND

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.719
IN A GIVEN FISCAL CYCLE MY

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.054

IT'S ADMIRABLE --

00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:50.374
OBVIOUSLY LEAD IS IS A CHEMICAL

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:52.243

THE CASE AND I AM HIGHLY

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:28.646

PASSED.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.359
AS FAR AS CLEANING GOES --

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:31.295
THE ADDRESS THAT MAYBE.

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:34.064
IT'S IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IN

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:35.432
TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:36.100
TWENTY EACH YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.801
CLEAN UP ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.269
HOMES A TOTAL OF TWENTY SIX

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:39.837
HUNDRED HOMES.

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.305
THAT THE RATE AT WHICH YOU KNOW

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:44.108
THEY'RE WORKING AT WE WE HAVE UP

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:45.442
TO TEN THOUSAND HOMES THAT NEED

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:46.910
TO BE CLEANED UP AT THAT RATE --

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:48.212
AND SO FOR THAT ALONE WE NEED

00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:49.513
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.582
MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION.

00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:53.083
FOR FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS A

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.784
FUNDING.

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:54.918
ARE WE IT WE HAVE PROVISIONS IN

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:55.986
HERE THAT THE MONEY NEEDS TO BE

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:58.589
USED FOR THIS AND NOT TO FILL

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:01.225
BACK HOLES WITH DTS T. OR WITH

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.559
HIGHER FEES ARE ALL THESE OTHER

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:03.727
PLACES RIGHT AND SO I WANT TO

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:04.695
MAKE SURE.

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.296
THAT IT'S GOING TO WHERE IT'S

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:07.731
SUPPOSED TO MY COMMUNITY SUBSET

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:08.999
THEY WERE VERY VOCAL AT THAT

00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:10.834
HEARING IN MY DISTRICT THAT THE

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:11.969
MONEY SHOULD BE USED FOR ITS

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:13.003
INTENTION.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.573
OF THE LACK OF TRUST WITH THE

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.543
MONEY BILLION MOVING AROUND.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.911
AND SO MY COMMITMENT IS NOT

00:46:20.978 --> 00:46:22.613
JUSTICE TO CLEAN UP THIS MESS

00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:24.681
WITH TO MAKE SURE WE DO WHAT WE

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:25.549
SAID OR GONNA DO FROM THE VERY

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:26.450
BEGINNING.

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:28.318
AND THAT I'M NOT CREATING YOU

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:28.952
KNOW MONEY FOR PET PROJECTS ALL

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:30.487
OVER THE STATE --

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:32.356
AND SO BUT THE REALITY IS IS

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:33.624
THAT WE NEED WE NEED THIS MONEY

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.126
AND AND WE NEED AT A AT A FASTER

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:37.661
RATE AT AT WHICH IS COMING IN.

00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:39.897
SO MY FOLLOW UP TO THAT IS.

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.465
I WAS ASSUMING A LOT OF THAT WAS

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:41.932
HAPPEN IN A WE'VE HAD

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:43.901
CONVERSATIONS SINCE THEN AND I

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:46.503
KNOW YOUR FRUSTRATION THERE --

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.172
AND YOU KNOW AS YOU RECALL WHEN

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:50.474
WE STARTED OUT THAT YOU KNOW I

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.209
WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:53.544
THE POLLUTERS WHO ARE GETTING

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.412
OFF THE HOOK BASICALLY SO THE

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.581
WAY I LOOK AT THIS IS THAT.

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:58.649
THEY DID THE DAMAGE AND THERE'S

00:46:58.715 --> 00:47:00.584
A LOT OF WRONG THINGS IN THAT

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:02.019
COMMUNITY ALONG WITH.

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:03.987
BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS AND YOU

00:47:04.054 --> 00:47:05.522
NAME IT WITH --

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:07.124
AIR QUALITY IN.

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.158
THERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THEY

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:09.927
WERE HONOR A CONTINUING PERMIT

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:11.295
FOR A LONG TIME WHICH I THINK IS

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:13.063
WAS VERY WRONG TO THE PUBLIC IN

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.565
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING NOT

00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:16.166
RIGHT THERE FOR MANY MANY MANY

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:17.467
YEARS.

00:47:17.534 --> 00:47:18.869
BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH REALITY

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:20.437
IN REALITY IS THERE'S

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.306
CONTAMINATION IN YOUR AREA SO I

00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:24.007
WAS OKAY WITH THAT BUT NOW WE'RE

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:25.809
TALKING ABOUT THESE HOST SITES

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:26.543
IN.

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.580
AND OTHER SITES OUT THERE I

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:30.447
WANNA I WANNA ASK HIM.

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:31.381
WHERE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES IN

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:33.517
THIS PROCESS I MEAN?

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:35.452
AT SOME POINT THAT THE THE OR

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:38.855
THE TAX AND MIKE IT'S IT'S ADDED

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:40.490
ON TO STE TO SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:41.858
CAUSE THE PROBLEM.

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:43.327
AND THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THE

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:44.595
PROBLEM GET TO WALK.

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:47.631
AND I THINK THAT'S NOT FAIR TO

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:49.266
THE REST OF CALIFORNIA --

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:50.334
THAT ARE PICKING UP THE TAB AND

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.903
THESE ARE BIG TABS AND THERE'S A

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.404
LOT OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE.

00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:55.205
TO YOU KNOW.

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:56.707
THAT'S OUR JOB HERE IS TO MANAGE

00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:58.075
A BUDGET AND MANAGE WHAT AND THE

00:47:58.141 --> 00:47:59.576
COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.078
CONTINUES TO RISE.

00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:02.279
AND SO I JUST WANTED YOUR

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:03.113
THOUGHTS AND AS I'M HAVING A

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.381
HARD TIME SWALLOWING THIS RIGHT

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:05.582
NOW BECAUSE I KNOW WE STILL HAVE

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:08.418
UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO TWO

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:09.019
IN OF I KNOW YOU GOT A HEAVY

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:10.921
LEFT HERE WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:11.755
I UNDERSTAND THAT SO I JUST WANT

00:48:11.822 --> 00:48:14.591
TO SHARE MY FRUSTRATION WITH YOU.

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:17.160
AND ALSO MY CONCERN ABOUT --

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:17.728
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:19.563
DAMAGE TO WHO ARE HOWEVER THEY

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.899
GOT AWAY WITH IT ARE STILL

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:23.533
GETTING AWAY WITH IT AND I JUST

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.568
THINK THAT'S WRONG.

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:25.769
HI EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE THAT

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:27.170
IT'S WRONG IF EVER IT TO ME A

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:27.804
BUNCH OF PEOPLE WOULD BE IN JAIL

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:28.405
RIGHT NOW.

00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:29.106
BUT I'M NOT THE QUEEN OF

00:48:29.172 --> 00:48:30.574
CALIFORNIA SO I CAN'T MAKE THAT

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:31.775
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT WE'RE

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:33.343
PUSHING FOR THAT THE ME SAY THAT

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.711
WHEN WE STARTED WITH THIS BILL

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.146
IT ALWAYS INCLUDED THE IDEA OF

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:37.314
THESE LEGACY STATES WE HAVEN'T

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:38.582
HAD IN THAT IT'S BEEN ABOUT A

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:39.416
FIFTH.

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:42.786
DOZEN TO FIT TO FIFTEEN AND AND

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.421
IN THE SAME WAY I AM WHOLLY IN

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:45.055
THE ADMINISTRATION ARE TRAVEL

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:46.857
ABOUT BORROWING MONEY FROM THE

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:48.925
FEE AND I'M CALLING THEM OUT.

00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:52.362
MAKING SURE THAT WE MADE WHICH

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:53.630
WITH IT'S ABOUT THE LEGACY SITES.

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:54.698
IT'S ABOUT EXCITED THE FACT THAT

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.233
WE ALREADY KNOW AND YES IT'S

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.602
UNFAIR BUT I HAVE TO WORRY MORE

00:48:58.669 --> 00:48:59.870

HAVE THESE ISSUES AS WELL AT THE

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:06.076
END OF THE DAY I FEEL

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:07.511
COMFORTABLE ASKING CONSUMERS TO

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:09.112
GIVE ME ABOUT A DOLLAR EVERY

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:09.713

WORK ON THIS.

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:55.558
AB -- FOR TO

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:58.361
AUTHORIZES THE STATE WATER BOARD

00:54:58.428 --> 00:54:59.929
TO ESTABLISH A FUNDING PROGRAM.

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.498
TO SUPPORT LOCAL OVERSIGHT OF

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:04.300
SMALL DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS.

00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:06.569
ARE THE PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING IS

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.071
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALL

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.639
SYSTEMS THAT THIRTY DIFFERENT

00:55:09.706 --> 00:55:11.107
COUNTIES.

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:13.043
AND THOSE COUNTIES MAY NOT HAVE

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:14.611
THE RESOURCES TO DO TO

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:16.179
OVERLOOKED THEM.

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:18.581
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:20.383
IS [inaudible]

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:23.053
ARM.

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.688
BECAUSE THE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE

00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:26.189
ENOUGH FEES SIX OF THE COUNTIES

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:27.557
OF ACTUALLY RETURNED DRINKING

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:29.826
WATER OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY BACK

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:31.561
TO THE STATE WATER BOARD.

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:34.097
BOB THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.765
THE STATE WATER BOARD REALLY

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:38.768
DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE OVERSIGHT.

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:40.670
OF WE THINK IT'S THEY THINK IT'S

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:42.105
BETTER DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.573
BUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.008
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:46.710
SO WHAT THEY DO HAVE IS AN OPT

00:55:46.776 --> 00:55:49.446
IN PROGRAM FOR LOCAL AGENCIES.

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:50.980
AND THE GOAL WOULD BE THAT THE

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.882
AGENCIES COULD OPT INTO THIS

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:54.017
PROGRAM.

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.719
AND THEN THE STATE WATER BOARD

00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:57.220
WHICH HAS FEES FROM THROUGHOUT

00:55:57.287 --> 00:55:58.455
THE STATE.

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:00.156
CAN NÁN HELP FUND THESE LOCAL

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:01.357
AGENCIES.

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:03.259
SO WHAT THIS BILL IS BASICALLY

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:05.862
DOING IS ASKING THE WATER BOARD

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:09.966
WITH THEIR FEES FROM OTHER AREAS.

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:11.167
TO ACTUALLY FUND THE CLEANUP ARE

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:12.936
EXCUSE ME TO FIND THE OVERSIGHT

00:56:13.002 --> 00:56:14.938
OF THE SMALL AGENCIES IN THESE

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:17.073
OTHER SMALLER TYPICALLY RURAL

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.242
COUNTIES WHICH SIMPLY DON'T HAVE

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:20.243
THE MONEY.

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:23.480
SO WE'RE LOOKING TO HELP THE

00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:25.515
SMALL RURAL.

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:28.118
WATER SYSTEMS WITH MONEY FOR

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:28.985
DATE.

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:30.954
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THIS IS

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.188
FOR I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:34.557
ANYONE WOULD NOT OPT IN.

00:56:34.624 --> 00:56:36.326
BUT IT IS STILL AN OPTION AND

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:38.128
THEY DO NOT HAVE.

00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:40.663
TO I'M HERE TODAY TO JUST TO

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.732

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:18.268
THE WHOLE IDEA HERE IS RATHER

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:19.903
THAN THE STATE TAKING OVER THE

00:57:19.969 --> 00:57:21.538

AFFORD TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:23.773
DO.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.575
THE STATE WILL SIMPLY USE THE

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:27.744

STATE AGENCY DOESN'T WISH TO SEE
