TWENTY TWO WE WERE DOWN TO. 27%

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:32.076
TO A BIG DROP THAT WAY BUT WE

00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:33.511
SEE A BIT OF A DEMOCRATIZATION

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:35.113
OF HATE SO FOR INSTANCE WITH

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:37.615

THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORTS

SHOW THAT THEY WERE ABOUT I

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.799
THINK SIXTEEN COUNTIES REPORTED

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.634
ZERO EIGHT CRIME. AND AGAIN-

00:33:56.701 --> 00:34:01.272
NATIONALLY- WE HAVE ABOUT 88%

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:03.474
THAT. EITHER SAY ZERO HATE

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.476

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:09.080
MOREOVER I THINK WE HAVE

00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:10.715
SOMETHING ELSE THAT THAT WE

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:12.683

DATE ON EXTREMIST HOMICIDES A

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:17.188
LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE

AG COUNTY WHEN THEY COUNTED.

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:20.725
ZERO ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:21.893
ACTUALLY COUNTED THREE WHICH IS

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:23.694
WAS ON THE HIGHER END OF WHAT

00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:24.896
WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST DECADE

00:34:24.962 --> 00:34:26.464
NOT BECAUSE THE AG DO ANYTHING

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:28.332
WRONG THAT INFORMATION CAME

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.501
OUT. AFTER ARREST AND DURING

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:33.438
THE INVESTIGATION AND- JUST

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:42.013
BEFORE. TRIAL BOB PUT. WE SAW A-

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:43.347

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:46.951
HOMICIDES NATIONALLY UNTIL.

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:47.585
TWENTY NINETEEN AND THIS IS THE

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:51.255
LATEST DATA WE COUNTED AT LEAST

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:52.924

NINETEEN. DEBT THAT AMOUNT THAT

00:34:59.464 --> 00:35:01.432
TWENTY SIX IS MORE THAN ALL THE

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:04.902
EXTRAS HOMICIDES COMBINED FOR

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:05.436

IN HOW THEY COUNT STUFF BUT

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.315

OTHER STATES DO. IS HAVE TASK

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.442

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:52.843
DEVOTED TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.044
IN NEW YORK NEW JERSEY THEY'RE

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.980
CONSIDERING NEW LEGISLATION.

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.748
THAT WHEN FIVE OR MORE PEOPLE

00:41:57.815 --> 00:41:59.283
ARE TARGETED THAT THAT BECOMES

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.684
AN ACT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM

00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:01.852
THERE'S THEIR THEIR ISSUES WITH

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:03.454
THAT DIFFERENT STATES ARE ALSO

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.755
LOOKING AT STREAMLINING THEIR

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.390
DATA COLLECTION METHODS. AND

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:08.125
CALIFORNIA WHICH ONCE WAS

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.861
REALLY AT THE LEAD FOR HAVING

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:12.529
THE HIGHEST NUMBER PER CAPITA

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:13.197

SO WE CAN'T REST ON OUR

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:23.107

DEPARTMENT WE ALSO SURVEYED

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:35.058
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:36.860
CALIFORNIA WE SURVEYED OVER TO

STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE IN

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:55.179
THAT WE VISITED SO WITH RESPECT

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:56.780
TO AN OUT REACH OUR CONCLUSION

00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:58.749
WAS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:00.584
IS NOT DOING ENOUGH AS FAR AS

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:02.252
CONDUCTING OUT REACH AND THE

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.287
DEPARTMENT JUSTICE COULD

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:04.621
CERTAINLY ASSIST WITH SOME OF

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:06.023
THAT. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:07.824
LOCALS TWO OF THE FOUR ENTITIES

00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:08.892
THAT WE VISITED WERE NOT

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:10.594
CONDUCTING ANY OUT REACH AT ALL

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.696
IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN THE

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:14.198
SURVEY RESPONSE INDICATED THAT

00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:17.067
ABOUT 30% OF THE ENTITIES THAT

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:18.635
WE SURVEYED THAT RESPONDED TO

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:20.771
OUR SURVEY SAID. NOW WE WILL

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:24.374
CONDUCT A REACH YOU CAN. USE.

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:26.043
AND THE A CRITICAL PORTENT ON

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:27.444
CERTAINLY BECAUSE- RESEARCH IS

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:28.178
TO. THAT HE CRIMES ARE REAP.

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:30.047
WHY IS THAT. FEAR OF FEAR OF

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:31.682
DEPORTATION LACK OF TRUST IN

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.617
THE COMMUNITY NOT REALLY A LACK

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:34.918
OF TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SO

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:36.420
THERE NEEDS TO BE A PARTNERSHIP

00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:38.121
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND-

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:39.256
VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE

00:47:39.323 --> 00:47:41.692
COMMUNITY. TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:43.193
TO REPORT HATE CRIMES SO THAT

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.262
THEY CAN BE ADDRESSED. AND

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:47.030
HOPEFULLY- YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:49.967
ARE REDUCED. DOJ WE BELIEVE IS

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:52.269
UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO ASSIST

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:53.503
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRST OF

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.338
ALL BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:56.106
STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO COLLECT

00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.375
THE DATA. THEY COULD ANALYZE

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:00.477
THAT DATA AND THEN PROVIDE SOME

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:01.845
ANALYSES TO LOCAL LAW

00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:03.947
ENFORCEMENT AS FAR AS- DO WE

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:05.048
NEED TO DO TARGETED OUTREACH

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:08.085
AND VERY. AT AREAS OF THE CITY

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.786

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:10.954
GROUPS THAT ARE IN- THEY ARE

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:14.725
VICTIMS OF THESE HATE CRIMES.

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:17.694
IN ADDITION WE IDENTIFY THE

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:20.097
ROUTE. THAT CREATED BACK IN

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:20.864
NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND WHEN

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:22.399
WE DO DURING THE TO THE AUDIT

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:23.367
THERE REALLY. A OF

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:25.168
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT

00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:27.638
PARTICULAR TEAM- COULD DO AND

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:29.072
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO FOR LOCAL

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:29.973
LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCAL

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.109
COMMUNITIES DOJ CERTAINLY WAS

00:48:32.175 --> 00:48:33.210
AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSE TEAM

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:34.911
BUT THEY WEREN'T. ADVERTISING

00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:36.280
IT THEY WEREN'T ENCOURAGING

00:48:36.346 --> 00:48:38.482
LOCALS TO REACH OUT FOR

00:48:38.548 --> 00:48:39.883
ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:40.617
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO WE

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:42.819
THINK- INCREASING AND IMPROVING

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:45.656
OUT REACH- WILL CERTAINLY HELP.

00:48:45.722 --> 00:48:47.157
THESE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OUR

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:49.826
SURVEY RESPONDENTS INDICATED I

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:51.528
THINK WAS 83% OF OUR SURVEY

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:52.162
RESPONDENTS SAID THEY HAD NEVER

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.630
RECEIVED ANY TYPE OF GUIDANCE

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:54.998
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.600
ABOUT HOW TO CONDUCT THE OUT

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:57.734
REACH. HOW IMPORTANT OUT

00:48:57.801 --> 00:48:59.736
REACHES- THE BENEFIT THE

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:01.638
BENEFITS OF OUT REACH IT CETERA

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:02.839
SO WE HAD A VARIETY OF

00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:04.174
RECOMMENDATIONS TO ALL OF THE

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.876
ENTITIES WITH RESPECT TO

00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:08.912
OUTREACH. NOW REPORTING.

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:10.547
CERTAINLY ARE WE FOUND THAT

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:12.382
HATE CRIMES WERE UNDER REPORTED

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:15.018
WE DID SOME ANALYSES OF-

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:16.586
INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVED

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:17.554
FROM THE ENTITIES THAT WE

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:19.222
SURVEYED WE ASK THEM TO REPORT

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:21.758
THEIR- A HATE CRIME DATA AND WE

00:49:21.825 --> 00:49:23.760
COMPARED IT TO THE DATA THAT

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:25.462
WAS REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:26.330
OF JUSTICE. AND THERE WERE

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:27.331
DIFFERENT. INFORMATION WE WERE

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:29.199
FROM THE- WAS HIGHER NOT

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.501
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BUT HIGHER

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:32.569
SO THERE WAS A DISCONNECT

00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:34.504
THERE. WE ALSO CAN AUDITS OF

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:37.040
CAMPUS CRIME. REPORTING THAT

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:39.242
UNDER THE CLEAR ACT THAT'S A

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:40.911
STATURE MEANT THAT WE HAVE TO

00:49:40.977 --> 00:49:42.145
LOOK AT THAT EVERY THREE YEARS

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:43.347
SO WE LOOKED AT THE CLEARY.

00:49:43.413 --> 00:49:44.981
INFORMATION AND WE AGAIN FOR.

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:46.316
PERMISSION AND A CLEAR IT

REPORTS. OF THAT UNIVERSITIES

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:50.954
HAVE TO SUBMIT THAT WERE NOT

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:52.022
SOME OF THOSE CRIME SHOULD HAVE

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:52.856
BEEN INCLUDED IN THE HATE CRIME

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.458
DATA THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:56.026
STATE TO DO JAKE. AND WE FOUND

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:57.327
DIFFERENCES THERE SO THERE'S

00:49:57.394 --> 00:50:00.831
REALLY. AT THE TIME WE

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:01.431
CONDUCTED THERE ARE THERE WERE

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:03.400
REALLY SOME CONCERNS WITH RISK

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:05.869

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.283
ENTITIES THAT YOU'RE RECEIVING

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.585
DATA FROM. AND THEY AT THAT

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:22.786
TIME DID NOT HAVE A COMPLETE

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.354
LIST OF ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:26.189
ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT

SHOULD BE REPORTING THIS DATA.

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:30.460
TO DOJ SO THAT WAS THAT WAS

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.396
CONCERNED NUMBER ONE. CONCERN

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:33.930
NUMBER TWO AGAIN WHAT DO JANE

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:35.198
PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO THE

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:36.299
LOCALS AS TO WHAT THE

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:38.869
EXPECTATIONS WERE. WITH RESPECT

00:50:38.935 --> 00:50:39.836
TO WHAT THEY SHOULD REPORT WHEN

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:43.206
THEY SHOULD REPORT IT- SO THE

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:44.574
THIS SURVEY AGAIN INDICATED

00:50:44.641 --> 00:50:46.443
THAT MANY MANY OF. A HIGH

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.445
PERCENT OVER 80% OF THE

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:49.813
ENTITIES THAT WE SURVEYED SAID

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.214
AGAIN WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:55.085
TYPE OF GUIDANCE FROM THE OKAY.

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.586
ABOUT THE TYPES OF. READ THAT

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:57.053
WE NEED TO SUBMIT THE

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.855
INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO

00:50:58.922 --> 00:50:59.689
SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:01.324
JUSTICE. AND THE FINAL THING

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:02.793
WITH RESPECT TO REPORTING IS

00:51:02.859 --> 00:51:04.094
DOJ WASN'T LOOKING AT THOSE

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:05.896
REPORTS AND DOING AN ANALYSIS

00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:06.530
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:08.565
INFORMATION THAT WAS BEING

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:09.800
REPORTED WAS ACCURATE AND

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:11.668
COMPLETE. SO THAT IF THEY DID

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:13.703
AN ANALYSIS AGAIN TYING BACKED

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.772
OUT REACH THEY WOULD HAVE THE

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:17.207
CORRECT INFORMATION TO DO AN

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:20.210
APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS- AND THEN

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:21.845
THE LAST AREA IS TRAINING

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:22.679
TRAINING IS CRITICALLY

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.214
IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WHAT WE

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:26.149
FOUND AS AS PROFESSOR LEVINE

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:27.984
INDICATED THERE WERE AND MANY

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:29.886
INSTANCES WHERE A CRIME WAS

00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:31.421
MISIDENTIFIED. IT WAS

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:32.889
IDENTIFIED AS A HATE INCIDENT

00:51:32.956 --> 00:51:33.590
AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:35.659
CATEGORIZED AS A HATE CRIME. SO

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:37.527
THAT LEADS TO UNDER REPORTING-

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:40.464
AND WE FOUND THAT CONSISTENTLY.

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.467
AMONG THE LOCAL ENTITIES THAT

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:45.602
WE VISITED WHERE THEY WERE

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:49.039
MISCLASSIFIED CERTAIN CRIMES.

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:50.507
SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:54.277
A CRIME. AND IN MANY CASES WAS

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:57.848
CLASS AND AS A INCIDENT.

00:51:57.914 --> 00:52:00.016
FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:08.325
THERE. I HATE CRIMES ALSO NOT

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:10.160
USING ALL OF THE TOOLS THAT ARE

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:11.495
OUT THERE THERE'S SOMETHING

00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:13.597
CALLED THE SUPPLEMENTAL- HATE

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:15.499
CRIME REPORT. THAT REALLY CAN

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:16.867
ASSIST LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:19.002
AND IDENTIFYING A HATE CRIME SO

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:21.004
THAT IT CAN BE REPORTED. AND

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:22.305
SOME OF THE ENTITIES WE VISITED

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:23.673
MANY OF THE ENTITIES WE

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.075
SURVEYED WERE NOT USING THIS

00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:27.077
SUPPLEMENTAL HATE CRIME REPORT.

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:28.712

ACCURATELY REPORT HATE CRIMES

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:37.554
TO. DOJ SO DOJ CAN PROVIDE

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:39.589
ASSISTANCE TO LOCALS. THE FINAL

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:41.191
AREA WITH RESPECT TO TRAINING

WHETHER OR NOT WERE A FOR.

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:37.747
ANALYZE HOW WELL AS HOW IS THIS

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:38.515
TRAINING KING THE TRAY THAT IS

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:41.284

LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:41.811
SPECIFICALLY WANTED DOJ TO

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.546
CREATE AND DISSEMINATE OUTREACH

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:45.015
MATERIALS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:47.050
OFFICERS ARE TO USE WHEN THEY

GO OUT SPECIFICALLY TO- FOCUS

00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:51.321
ON AVERAGE TO VULNERABLE

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:52.555
COMMUNITIES THOSE FROM AND-

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:53.990
EXPERIENCE A HATE CRIME AND

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:57.260
THOSE- LEAST LEAST LIKELY TO

00:54:57.327 --> 00:55:00.597
REPORTED WE DID FIND. THAT THE

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:02.032
KIND OF AT THE ONE YEAR MARK

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.867
THEY DOJ HAS UPDATED ITS HATE

00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:05.769

00:55:05.835 --> 00:55:07.337
WEBSITE. AND ALSO HOSTED A HATE

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:10.140
CRIME OF EVENTS BOB HOWEVER IT

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:11.541
IS YET TO DISTRIBUTE OR CREATE

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:13.009
ANY NEW MATERIALS RELATED TO

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:14.577
OUTREACH EFFORTS TO LAW

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:15.812
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES COULD USE.

00:55:15.879 --> 00:55:17.547
SO ALTHOUGH IT IS PARTIALLY

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:18.581
IMPLEMENTED THEY HAVE A LONG

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:20.684
WAY TO GO THERE FOR THIS FIRST

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:21.751
TWO RECOMMENDATIONS. THE THIRD

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:25.488
RECOMMENDATION THE PAGE DETAILS

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:27.424
THE HE CRIME RAPID RESPONSE

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:32.095
TEAM. NOW WITH. IDEAS EXPERTS

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:33.730
DOJ THAT GO TO THIS LONG FORCED

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.665
WHENEVER THEY- A ARRAY OF A CAR

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.267
ARE ONE X. EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.703
PRO. CASE HOWEVER ONLY HALF OF

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:40.637
LONG FOR SO AGENCIES. WE

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:41.604
SURVEYED EVEN KNEW OF ITS

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:43.373
EXISTENCE ADDED NEVER EVEN BEEN

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.208
DEPLOYED. SO WE RECOMMENDED

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:46.342
THAT AND DOJ HAS FULLY

00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:47.977
IMPLEMENTED- KIND OF SENDING

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:49.145
OUT INFORMATIONAL NOTICES

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:50.947
UPDATING ITS WEBSITE AND MAKING

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:52.782
SURE THAT ALL THE ENTITIES AND

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:55.985
STATE NEW- THAT THEY COULD RELY

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.087
ON DOJ IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN.

00:55:57.153 --> 00:56:00.223
SAID SIT OUT REACH ON THAT PAGE

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.724
THREE. WE DISCUSS

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:02.358
RECOMMENDATIONS TO DOJ RELATED

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:03.693
TO IMPROVING HATE CRIME

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.696
REPORTING. NOW THE FIRST

00:56:06.763 --> 00:56:08.164
RECOMMENDATION THERE IS TO

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:08.932
DEVELOP A LIST OF LAW

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:10.867
ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES TO ENSURE

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:11.735
THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE ALL THE

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:14.003
REPORTS THEY NEED SO WHEN WE

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.305
FIRST WENT OUT TO DOJ NOT ONLY

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:16.239
DID THEY HAVE AN INCOMPLETE

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:17.540
LIST OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:18.942
ENTITIES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:21.311
REPORT TO THE MONTHLY BUT 40%

00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:22.445
OF THE INFORMATION FOR

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:25.248
CONTACTING THOSE IN AGENCIES

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:26.349
WAS INCORRECT OR INCOMPLETE. SO

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:28.251
EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO SEND A

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:29.986
NOTE. WE COULDN'T IN ADDITION

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.287
WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THEY

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:32.322
SEND OF GUIDANCE ON HOW TO

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:34.457
REPORT ACCURATELY TO THE AGENT.

00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:34.924
TO THE TO ALL THE LAW

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:36.626
ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES. AND THEN

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:38.294
CONDUCT PERIODIC REVIEWS SO

00:56:38.361 --> 00:56:39.195
ONCE THE NEW OKAY WE'RE GETTING

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:40.530
THE REPORTS FROM EVERYONE EACH

00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:42.499
EACH MONTH. ARE THEY DOING A

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:43.266
DISTRIBUTOR WHICH FOR THAT

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:44.267
THAT'S ACCURATE BECAUSE WE'VE

00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:46.169
GOT ABOUT 20% OF THE HE CRIME

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:49.072
REPORTS. SENT TO DOJ WERE AN

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:51.541
ACTOR IN SOME RESPECT. SO DOJ

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:52.742
HAS DEVELOPED SOME NEW

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:55.512
PROCEDURES- TO LOCATE AND ADD

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:56.980
NEW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO

00:56:57.046 --> 00:56:58.381
ITS LIST. OF REQUIRED

ACCURATE. SO THERE'S- KIND OF

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.472
SOME MOVEMENT SOME PROGRESS BUT

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:25.275

COUNTY SHERIFF THINGS LIKE

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:50.667
THAT. AND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:53.236
DIFFICULT EVEN IF DOJ WERE TO

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.370
ANALYZE WHERE HE COMES A

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:56.072
RECURRING TO ACTUALLY GET

JURISDICTIONS. SO WE

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:12.455

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.222
A GOOD IDEA TO SOME WAY

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:08.657
MEMORIALIZED SECOND HERE

01:07:08.724 --> 01:07:11.394
REVIEW. IN THE STATE HERE UP

DECIDE. AND ON. GREAT ASSEMBLY.

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:29.345
IS FILLED. YES AND I SURE

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:30.179
ACTUALLY I WAS IN **** BECAUSE-

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:30.813
HE KNOW YOU CALL IT THE DEVICE.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.815
OF HATE. ACROSS ALL THE GROUPS

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.583
AND SIX COUNTIES ARE. BUT I WAS

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:35.885
WONDERING HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:37.052
BECAUSE OF DEFINITION- BECAUSE

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.421
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE GUIDELINES

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:39.155
OF PROCEDURES THAT WERE

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:41.190
IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT-

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:42.458
BECAUSE AND WE GOT TO FIGURE

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:44.493
OUT HOW WE- TAKE CORRECTIVE

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.728
ACTION WHETHER THAT'S DONE

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.062
LEGISLATIVELY OR WHETHER THAT'S

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:49.265
DONE- THROUGH ANOTHER MEANS AND

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.299
I'M JUST. TRYING TO SEE THE

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:51.801
COMET JUST ON THAT BECAUSE OF

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.436
TRYING TO FIND SOME. ACTIONABLE

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:57.306
ITEMS WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH SO

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:57.873
THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.375
JUSTICE DOES HAVE A DOES

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.043
INITIATED DESK REVIEW PROCESS

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:02.278
AND ALL OF THE HATE CRIMES TO

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.245
COME IN AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:04.046
PER CAPITA RATE OF HATE CRIMES

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:06.182
IS ALMOST DOUBLE. WHAT

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.583
CALIFORNIA'S IS AND WE BELIEVE

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:08.317
THAT THAT MIGHT THEY'RE

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:09.151
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THAT

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:10.386
MAYBE BECAUSE THAT THEY'RE

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:11.921
ACTUALLY ASKING FOR ALL OF THE

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:13.889
REPORTS FROM THE LOCALS. AND

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:15.024

CHECKING TO SEE ARE YOU

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.827
REPORTING ALL OF THEM SO THAT'S

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:18.761
WHY WE MADE THAT RECOMMENDATION

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:21.864
TO IDEA DATA ALSO. A CALIFORNIA

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:22.631
DOD TO DO THAT AND THE LATEST

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.500

COUNT AS A WHITE SUPREMACIST IT

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.643
IN THAT WE HAD POWER WAY FOR

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:15.911

HOPEFULLY IS COVERED BUT IN

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.482
MOST CASES NOT COVERED. SO YOU

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:34.550

THROUGH THE TRAINING THAT YOU

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:40.022
HATE CRIME THAT'S MY QUESTION.

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:42.758
WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT IN ALL

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.159
AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:46.261
STATEMENT ON FOURTEEN THIS IS

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:51.233
SO JUST A IN ALL OF. ON ON.

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:54.169
HUMAN TRAIT THEY THE TEND TO.

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:58.073
ISOLATE AND- OTHER THAN THEM

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.574
THEY HATE THE SOMETHING ELSE OR

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:03.945
DIFF DIFFERENT THINGS. SO WHY.

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:09.251
DO YOU THINK YOUR EX. WE'RE

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:10.819
GONNA CUT IT DOWN AND THEN I

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:15.457
WONDER JUST A COMING TO MY MIND.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:16.725
OPPOSITE OF A HATE IS SO MAYBE

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:23.365
LOVE. MAYBE PROMOTING. THE THAT

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:24.866
THE BEAUTY OF A LOVER TWO

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:27.536
CHILDREN RATHER THAN NOT TO

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:32.340
HATE. AND HOW HOW DO YOU TRAIN

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:36.144
CHILDREN NOT TO HATE EACH OTHER.

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:39.648
BUT OPPOSITE R. BA L. IN A

01:18:39.714 --> 01:18:41.349
SENSITIVITY AND THE BEAUTY OF

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.785
OUR LOVE IN A THAT MAY BE MORE

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:45.387
EFFECTIVE A HAVE YOU DONE ANY

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.022
STUDY IN THAT KIND OF THING

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:50.425
AREAS SO HOW TO REDUCE AND OF

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:53.462
WHAT THE METHODOLOGY HISTORY

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:56.264
YOU MAY PROPOSE. WHAT ARE

01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:57.866
DIFFERENT TYPES OF OFFEND. BY

01:18:57.933 --> 01:18:59.868
ANYONE TO AMOL BUT I IT WAS I

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:00.969
THINK ENFORCEMENT HAVE HAD AN

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:03.105
IMPACT WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:04.506
SEE IT AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:05.907
GETTING PIECES OF THE JIGSAW

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:07.609
PUZZLE NOT THE WHOLE PUZZLE.

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.945
BUT WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:12.047
DECLINE IN IN THE PROPERTY HATE

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:15.150
CRIMES FOR INSTANCE ALSO UP

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:18.687
WHEN WE HAVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:21.490
PROMOTE TOLERANCE- I THINK THAT

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:24.159
CREATES A NICE ENVIRONMENT BUT

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.961
WITH WITH REGARD TO TRAINING

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:27.996
IT'S IMPERATIVE. THAT THESE

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:30.298
CASES ARE COMMON TO LAW

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:31.900
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE IF THEY

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.401
DON'T WE SOMETIMES SEE THEM

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:34.469
OCCUR SEE REALLY WITH

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:39.074
ESCALATING A SEVERITY ALSO.

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:40.909
MENTAL HEALTH ON THERE A LOT

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:42.144
FOLKS WERE YOU KNOW THE HARD

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:44.312
CORE WHICH YOU'RE VERY SMALL

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:45.947
SLIVER OF OFFENDERS BUT THE

01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:46.815
MAKE UP THE OVERWHELMING

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:48.049
MAJORITY OF THE HOMICIDAL

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.352
OFFENDERS. ON AND THE TALK

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.988
ABOUT ONCE THE REFORMED- THE

01:19:53.054 --> 01:19:53.755
ONES THAT HAVE COMMITTED

CREATED SEVERAL WORKGROUPS WITH

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:05.078
THE COMMUNITY TO- IMPROVE OUR

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:06.646
RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT IS WHERE

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:07.814
OUR HATE CRIMES SUPPLEMENTAL

01:48:07.881 --> 01:48:09.716

COMMUNITY AND PLEASE-

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:14.521
DEPARTMENT MEMBERS THEY CAME UP

01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:15.922
WITH THE IDEA FOR THAT.

01:48:15.989 --> 01:48:18.692
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. I'M

01:48:18.758 --> 01:48:22.562
POLICING HAS CHANGED- WE DON'T

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:24.331
PLEASE STOCKS WE POLICE

01:48:24.397 --> 01:48:27.734
BEHAVIOR ONE OF THE REASONS

01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:30.770
THAT CROSS HATE CRIMES GET

01:48:30.837 --> 01:48:33.306
MISCLASSIFIED IS BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:48:33.373 --> 01:48:35.375
THINK OF THEM AS HATE CRIMES. A

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:37.244
HATE CRIME IS FILING SOMEONE

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:39.045
CIVIL RIGHTS BECAUSE OF A

01:48:39.112 --> 01:48:40.947
PROTECTED CHARACTERISTIC THAT

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:43.316
VERY VERY VERY RARELY OCCURS

01:48:43.383 --> 01:48:45.518
UNLESS AND IN CALIFORNIA WHAT

01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:47.821
OCCURS IS A BIAS MOTIVATED

01:48:47.888 --> 01:48:49.656
CRIME AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE

01:48:49.723 --> 01:48:53.693
THE PROBLEM. SO THE PENAL CODE

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.696
SAYS THAT. EITHER IN WHOLE OR

01:48:56.763 --> 01:48:58.531
IN PART THE BIAS MOTIVATION

01:48:58.598 --> 01:49:00.533
MUST BE PART OF WHY THE CRIME

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:03.970
OCCURRED THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS-

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:05.872
CASE LAW SAYS IT MUST BE A

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:08.208
SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR BUT THAT'S

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:11.244
ALL IT SAYS. IS 1% ENOUGH IS 5%

01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:13.647
ENOUGH DOES HAVE TO BE 51%

01:49:13.713 --> 01:49:15.115
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE ISSUE

01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:17.851
WE HAVE CRIMES THAT ARE BIASED

01:49:17.918 --> 01:49:19.953
MOTIVATED THAT GET MISS CARE

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:24.658
CATEGORY. CATEGORIZED SUCH AS A

01:49:24.724 --> 01:49:26.927
AN ARGUMENT OVER A PARKING SPOT.

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:27.961
TWO PEOPLE GET OUT OF THE CAR

01:49:28.028 --> 01:49:30.263
START YELLING AT EACH OTHER ONE

01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:31.298
SPEECH ON THE OTHER YOU HAVE A

01:49:31.364 --> 01:49:33.566
BATTERY THE PERSON WHO SPENT

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:35.902
NOW WALKS AWAY AND THROWS A

01:49:35.969 --> 01:49:39.539
RACIAL SLUR. AT THE VICTIM.

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:44.077
WHAT IS THAT. A SUBSTANTIAL

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:44.678
FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION OF A

01:49:44.744 --> 01:49:48.581
CRIME. SO THAT IS WHY WE HAVE

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:50.750
THE I CAN US TEN PEOPLE THAT

01:49:50.817 --> 01:49:53.386
QUESTION AND I'LL GET. PROBABLY

01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:54.788
FIVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS SO

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:57.857
THAT'S WHY THAT WERE HAVING THE

01:49:57.924 --> 01:50:00.160
ISSUES WITH THE REPORTS. TRYING

01:50:00.226 --> 01:50:01.628

01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:06.399
THIRTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THE

01:50:09.836 --> 01:50:11.838
INCIDENTS WHICH ARE 99% OF OUR

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:13.873

WITH THE COMMUNITY OF COURSE

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:46.666

TESTIMONY AND I DON'T KNOW

01:52:06.986 --> 01:52:08.922
WHETHER WE START THERE WE-

01:52:08.988 --> 01:52:12.025
START WITH THE FIRST ONE. BUT

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:14.227
WELL LET'S JUST START WITH A

01:52:14.294 --> 01:52:15.562
MISTER MARTINEZ OF WE CAN'T.

01:52:15.628 --> 01:52:16.930
HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER

01:52:16.996 --> 01:52:18.364
OF ERRORS AND A NUMBER OF

01:52:18.431 --> 01:52:20.033
ERRORS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:22.068
AUDIT FROM LAPD FOR INSTANCE

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:24.404
NOW IS IT MOSTLY BECAUSE OF.

01:52:24.471 --> 01:52:27.807
THE PARKING SPOT INCIDENT THE

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:28.374
SHOCKING ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:29.008
WHETHER WE SHOULD COST FOR THAT

01:52:29.075 --> 01:52:30.710
IS A GREAT I I'LL GIVE YOU. ONE

01:52:30.777 --> 01:52:32.679
OF THE ACTORS ONE OF THE HEIRS

01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:36.716
WILL. ACE A STUDENT AT A TOOL

01:52:36.783 --> 01:52:42.922
FOR OUT AS IF. IF HE DID NOT

01:52:42.989 --> 01:52:43.556
MOVE OUT OF THE WAY HE WOULD BE

01:52:43.623 --> 01:52:45.325
BETTER. BECAUSE OF HIS GLORY.

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:48.561
SO HE MISSED CLASS THAT BECAUSE

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:52.365
WE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS ENOUGH.

01:52:52.432 --> 01:52:56.736
TO BECAUSE HIS FEELING OF IT.

01:52:56.803 --> 01:52:57.637
THE SUSPECTS NEVER EXPRESSED IT.

01:52:57.704 --> 01:53:01.407
IN SO DOJ BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:53:01.474 --> 01:53:03.409
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME WE

01:53:03.476 --> 01:53:04.244
DIDN'T THINK IT SHOULD HAVE

01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:05.812
BEEN BUT IS THAT TYPE OF

01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:08.982
INCIDENT IT'S NOT THE SWASTIKA

01:53:09.048 --> 01:53:12.018
IT'S NOT THE- CALLING A SLUR

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:13.686
AND THEN HITTING SOMEBODY IT'S

01:53:13.753 --> 01:53:15.455
THE BATES NUMBERS THAT WERE

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:18.124
THAT WERE HAVING ISSUES WITH.

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:18.925
OKAY SO IT'S NOT A LACK OF

01:53:18.992 --> 01:53:20.493
SUPPORT OF THE INCIDENCES IS

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.262
JUST THE CLASSIFICATION. OF

01:53:22.328 --> 01:53:24.130
THEM MY GUESS IS. WHERE THE AIR

01:53:24.197 --> 01:53:28.568
IS YES WHAT FOR THE ON THE

01:53:28.635 --> 01:53:30.370
PLEASE DEPARTMENTS PART YES SO

01:53:30.436 --> 01:53:31.304
THERE IS CHEN THERE IS UNDER

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:32.739
REPORTING FROM THE PUBLIC AND

01:53:32.805 --> 01:53:34.440
THAT IS BECAUSE OF OUR DECADES

01:53:34.507 --> 01:53:37.911
LONG WHEN I WHEN I STARTED WE

01:53:37.977 --> 01:53:40.513
WERE AN OCCUPYING FORCE. WE

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.415
WANTED THEM TO FERRIS THAT'S

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:44.184
NOT THE WAY IT IS ANYMORE MMHM

01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:47.086
WE TRIED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:48.221
WE'RE WE'RE DOING WAY BETTER

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:52.492
THAN WE WERE. BUT IT TAKES TIME

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:53.226
TO BUILD THAT TRUST WITH

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:56.062
COMMUNITY WE'RE WORKING HARD TO

01:53:56.129 --> 01:54:00.333
DO IT AND- AS THE IF YOU LOOK

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.101
AT OUR STATS YOU'LL SEE THAT

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:02.635
ACROSS ALL THE PROTECT THE

01:54:02.702 --> 01:54:04.437
CHARACTER. SIX THE PERCENTAGE

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:06.139
GOING UP THEY THEY KIND OF

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:09.342
MATCH EACH OTHER. SO THAT LEADS

01:54:09.409 --> 01:54:10.643
US TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S OUR

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:14.814
OUTREACH EFFORTS NOT SPATE OF.

01:54:14.881 --> 01:54:15.815
CRIMES AGAINST A CERTAIN

01:54:15.882 --> 01:54:17.350
COMMUNITY IS THAT THEY'RE

01:54:17.417 --> 01:54:19.452
TRUSTING US MORE THINKING WE'RE

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:20.853
GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.855
WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE IT

01:54:22.922 --> 01:54:23.489
AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF

01:54:23.556 --> 01:54:27.193
THEM. SO AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.028
USED TO GOT IT GOT IT THAT

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:32.065
MAKES SENSE AND FOR THE

01:54:32.131 --> 01:54:34.334
REPORTING SO YOU KNOW YOU GIVE

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:35.435
TWO EXAMPLES NOW AND I'M JUST

01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:37.237
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- THEY THEN

01:54:37.303 --> 01:54:38.404
JUST JUDGMENT CALLS BY THE

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:40.873
OFFICERS IT'S RESPONDING OR IS

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:43.209
IT YOU KNOW THIS THE QUESTION I

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:45.178
HAD FOR DOJ WAS YOU KNOW THE

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:46.746
AUDIT ALSO IDENTIFIED THE LACK

01:54:46.813 --> 01:54:48.915
OF COMING UP CLEAR GUIDELINES

01:54:48.982 --> 01:54:51.684
OUR BEST PRACTICES DOES IT.

01:54:51.751 --> 01:54:52.452
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:53.853
GUIDELINES AND CLEAR PRACTICES

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:56.956
BABY FROM DOJ OR IS IT THE YOU

01:54:57.023 --> 01:54:58.057
KNOW JUDGMENT CALLS OF THE

01:54:58.124 --> 01:54:59.292
OFFICER RESPONDING TO AN

01:54:59.359 --> 01:55:00.994
INCIDENT OF TRYING TO FIGURE

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.062
OUT. THAT GAP. I BELIEVE IT'S

01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:05.732
COMBINATION. SO WE ARE UPDATING

01:55:05.798 --> 01:55:07.567

01:55:07.634 --> 01:55:09.168
OUR HE KIND POLICY AND ONE OF

01:55:09.235 --> 01:55:10.436
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE ADDING IN

01:55:10.503 --> 01:55:12.805
IS WE HAVE FIVE LEVELS A REVIEW

01:55:12.872 --> 01:55:14.674
FOR EVERY REPORT. SO THAT WE

01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:17.877
DON'T MISS IT. BEFORE IT WAS

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:21.147
TOO. IT WAS THE PERSON WHO

01:55:21.214 --> 01:55:22.682
ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM AND THE

01:55:22.749 --> 01:55:24.751
SERGEANT WHO READ THE REPORT

LAYERS SO THAT. HOPEFULLY

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:31.024
SOMEBODY CATCHES IT I'M I'M

01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:32.358

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:36.663
CORRECTS IT ANOTHER THING THAT

01:55:36.729 --> 01:55:39.198
WE'RE DOING IS WE ARE- WE

01:55:39.265 --> 01:55:41.167

THAT THE REPORT GETS CODED INTO

01:55:47.907 --> 01:55:49.609
THE SYSTEM IT'S AUTOMATICALLY

01:55:49.676 --> 01:55:51.110
POPULATED ON THE WEBSITE SO

01:55:51.177 --> 01:55:53.613
THAT THE PUBLIC CAN SEE. WHAT'S

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.748
GOING ON WHEN IT HAPPENS IF

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:58.451
SOMETHING GETS RE CLASSIFIED TO

01:55:58.518 --> 01:56:00.586
OR FROM THEY CAN INQUIRE AS TO

01:56:00.653 --> 01:56:03.589
WHY BUT IT GETS UPDATED REAL

01:56:03.656 --> 01:56:06.092
TIME TRYING TO BE TRANSPARENT-

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:07.126
SO THAT WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:10.630
NOT CAN BOOKS GOT IT. ONE

01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:12.765
COMMENT WRITE ON ON THE DO SIDE

01:56:12.832 --> 01:56:14.667
AS A MENTIONED WE HAVE- SINCE

01:56:14.734 --> 01:56:17.236
THE AUDIT- INSTITUTE A NEW

01:56:17.303 --> 01:56:19.105
QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS BY

01:56:19.172 --> 01:56:20.506
WHICH WE REQUIRE ALL THE

01:56:20.573 --> 01:56:22.575
UNDERLYING INCIDENT REPORTS TO

01:56:22.642 --> 01:56:24.711
BE SUBMITTED TO US- SO THAT WE

01:56:24.777 --> 01:56:27.847
CAN. DETERMINE HOW HATE CRIMES

01:56:27.914 --> 01:56:29.615
ARE BEING REPORTED AND IF

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:30.383
THEY'RE BEING REPORTED

01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:32.452
CORRECTLY SO JUST GOING BACK TO

01:56:32.518 --> 01:56:34.887
THE ISSUES THAT THE JUDGMENT

01:56:34.954 --> 01:56:36.055
CALL. I THINK THE NUMBER OF

01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:37.790
SCARY AS THE THAT FOLKS COULD

01:56:37.857 --> 01:56:39.492
IN THE ROOM COULD COME UP WITH

01:56:39.559 --> 01:56:40.493
ARE INFINITE RIGHT AND SO I

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.129
THINK. HAVING THAT INFORMATION

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:44.697
THE UNDERLYING INCIDENT REPORT

01:56:44.764 --> 01:56:46.733

01:56:54.207 --> 01:56:56.209
OR HOW EIGHT INCIDENTS ARE

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:57.310
DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER IS

01:56:57.377 --> 01:56:58.878
CRITICAL TO FIGURING OUT. YOU

01:56:58.945 --> 01:57:01.347
KNOW WHAT ARE THE BEST

01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:01.948
PRACTICES THAT WE'RE GONNA PUT

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:03.383

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:38.284
BASED OFF THE TEST FROM THAN TO

01:57:38.351 --> 01:57:39.285
NEED TO TREAT THAT FOR AT MORE

01:57:39.352 --> 01:57:41.387
THING OR WHY THINGS UNDER

RIGHT FROM YOUR OFFICERS ON THE

01:57:48.394 --> 01:57:50.163
STREET TO GETTING THE CORRECT

GLAD WE- PUT IN THE BUDGET FIVE

01:57:58.538 --> 01:58:00.540
MORE PEOPLE BUT- ARE THOSE FIVE

01:58:00.606 --> 01:58:02.742
PEOPLE BEING AFFECTED WITH THE

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:03.276
DATA THAT WE HAVE AND I'M

01:58:03.342 --> 01:58:04.510
TRYING TO. FIGURE THAT GAP OUT

01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:06.879
THE AUDIT. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:08.548
TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND BECAUSE

01:58:08.614 --> 01:58:10.683
OF WHAT THE AUDIT FOUND IS

01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:13.019
WE'VE MADE THESE- MORE LEVELS

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:14.787
OF REVIEW REVIEW MADE THE

01:58:14.854 --> 01:58:16.722
IMPROVEMENTS SEND DIGITAL

01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:19.192
COPIES OF THE REPORTS TO DOJ-

01:58:19.258 --> 01:58:21.060
THE- SO THESE ARE THE- THE

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:24.931
STEPS WE'VE TAKEN SINCE. THE

01:58:24.997 --> 01:58:26.365
AUDIT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DID

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:28.601
THE AUDIT RIGHT SO WE DID

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:30.436
RECEIVE- FIVE POSITIONS AS PART

01:58:30.503 --> 01:58:32.638
OF THE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN

01:58:32.705 --> 01:58:35.107
TWENTY AND ON BUDGET- AND SO

01:58:35.174 --> 01:58:37.210
THOSE WE HAVE ONE POSITION

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:37.944
THAT'S FILLED THE RESEARCHER

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:39.846
THAT I MENTIONED- AND THEN

01:58:39.912 --> 01:58:41.481
THERE'S FOR POSITIONS THAT WE

01:58:41.547 --> 01:58:43.182
ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FILLING.

01:58:43.249 --> 01:58:45.651
AND SO OR FOR. RECRUITMENT

01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:47.787
EFFORT DID NOT LEAD TO A

01:58:47.854 --> 01:58:49.121
SUFFICIENT CAñADA POLL WHICH

01:58:49.188 --> 01:58:51.190
IS WHY WE'RE ENGAGING IN A

01:58:51.257 --> 01:58:52.792
SECOND ROUND OF RECRUITMENT

01:58:52.859 --> 01:58:54.794
BECAUSE AS WE ALL GRAY WE WANT

01:58:54.861 --> 01:58:55.495
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:58:55.561 --> 01:58:57.497
EXCELLENT CANDIDATES FOR THE

01:58:57.563 --> 01:58:58.598
FOR THIS POSITION SO. I ONCE

01:58:58.664 --> 01:59:01.234
THOSE FOLKS ARE ON BOARD WILL

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:02.869
JUST CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO

01:59:02.935 --> 01:59:05.137
PROVE OUR DATA COLLECTION AND

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:09.075
TRAINING. EFFORTS. OKAY YEAH

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:09.675
I'M STRANDED AT HOW DO WE THE

01:59:09.742 --> 01:59:11.377
OF THE REPORTS TO. FIGURE THIS

01:59:11.444 --> 01:59:13.212
OUT SO THERE IS RIGHT THERE IS

01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:15.314
THE TRAINING THAT WE'RE DOING

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:17.550
ON TO ELEAZAR TO DIRECTLY TO

01:59:17.617 --> 01:59:19.619
ELEAZAR ABOUT. THIS IS HOW YOU

01:59:19.685 --> 01:59:23.389
IDENTIFY AND REPORT HE CRIMES-

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:24.423
AND THEN THERE WAS ON IT SO

01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:26.359
THAT'S- I GUESS MAYBE AT THE

01:59:26.425 --> 01:59:27.727
FRONT END AND THEN ON THE BACK

01:59:27.793 --> 01:59:30.496
AND- FOR EACH- PRIME. THAT'S

01:59:30.563 --> 01:59:31.964
REPORTED TO US WE LOOK AT THE

01:59:32.031 --> 01:59:33.799
UNDERLYING INCIDENT REPORT TO

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:36.702
SEE IF IT'S BEING ACCURATELY-

01:59:36.769 --> 01:59:37.703
ACCURATELY COATED AND

01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:39.805
IDENTIFIED. I MEAN AND THEN OF

01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:41.040
COURSE THERE'S THE UNDER

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:43.009
REPORTING THAT'S HAPPENING-

01:59:43.075 --> 01:59:45.645
BECAUSE COMMUNITIES- MAY NOT

01:59:45.711 --> 01:59:46.746
HAVE THE TRUST AND LAW

01:59:46.812 --> 01:59:48.814
ENFORCEMENT. BUT THEY NEED TO-

01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:50.316
AND SO THAT'S- A THAT'S THAT'S

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:52.251
THE ROLE THAT- AN ATTORNEY FROM

01:59:52.318 --> 01:59:54.654
DOJ COULD HELP PLAY I MEAN I

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.789
THINK. IN PARTS OF THE ERROR

01:59:56.856 --> 02:00:03.663
IS. THERE CAN BE. UP. TO EIGHT.

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:04.330
MISUNDERSTANDINGS ARE. WHAT THE-

02:00:04.397 --> 02:00:04.964
ARE OF ENGAGING WITH LAW

02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:06.866
ENFORCEMENT SO FOLKS MAY NOT

02:00:06.933 --> 02:00:08.000
KNOW THAT TO CALIFORNIA LAW

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:09.735
PREVENTS. IN A PEOPLE FROM

02:00:09.802 --> 02:00:12.271
BEING DEPORTED- AND ENGAGING

02:00:12.338 --> 02:00:13.873
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THAT.

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:15.007
YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA LAW

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:17.376
PROTECTS IN A VICTIMS SO. I

02:00:17.443 --> 02:00:19.912
THINK HAVING A DOJ ATTORNEY WHO

02:00:19.979 --> 02:00:21.747
COULD DO MORE OF THAT WORK-

02:00:21.814 --> 02:00:23.082
WITH A HUMAN THE LOOK AT THE

02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:24.483
WITH THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:25.885
WITH THE HUMAN RELATIONS

02:00:25.952 --> 02:00:28.054
COMMISSIONS. WITH THE ADVOCATES

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:29.822
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD GO

02:00:29.889 --> 02:00:32.024
A LONG WAY IN INCREASING

02:00:32.091 --> 02:00:33.859
REPORTING AT THE COMMUNITY

02:00:33.926 --> 02:00:36.462
SIDE. GOT IT. NOW DOES IT MANTA

02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:39.532
PLEASE. TELL OUR BECAUSE OF

02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:40.833
POLICY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.535
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE

02:00:42.602 --> 02:00:44.604
LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NUMBERS MAY

02:00:44.670 --> 02:00:46.606
NEVER MATCH. TO GIVE YOU AN

02:00:46.672 --> 02:00:49.809
EXAMPLE. FOR MY DEPARTMENT

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:51.611
EVERY VICTIM OF A VIOLENT CRIME

02:00:51.677 --> 02:00:53.179
GETS REPORT NUMBER SO IF YOU

02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:55.281
HAVE ONE INCIDENT WITH FIVE

02:00:55.348 --> 02:00:58.050
VICTIMS THAT IS FIVE REPORTS.

02:00:58.117 --> 02:00:59.218
WHEN I REPORT THAT TO

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:01.120
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT'S

02:01:01.187 --> 02:01:03.155
ONE INCIDENT WITH FIVE VICTIMS

02:01:03.222 --> 02:01:05.591
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE FOR MORE

02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:06.192
THAN THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ON

02:01:06.258 --> 02:01:08.260
MY FINAL NUMBERS AND NAMES

02:01:08.327 --> 02:01:10.229
THAT'S THE WAY I'M NOT SURE

02:01:10.296 --> 02:01:13.099
WITH- CYBER IS IN. AND DIVERSE

02:01:13.165 --> 02:01:14.700
WHEN THAT COMES OUT. HOPEFULLY

02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:17.303
NEXT YEAR- IF THAT'S GONNA

02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:18.771
CHANGE BUT THAT'S HOW ARE

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:20.706
REPORTING SYSTEM IS NOW SO I

02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:21.641
WOULD HOPE WITH SABRES IN A

02:01:21.707 --> 02:01:22.708
DATABASE SYSTEM WE COULD BE

02:01:22.775 --> 02:01:24.644
ABLE TO. TEASE OUT THAT DATA

02:01:24.710 --> 02:01:29.415
EITHER WAY RIGHT. WE COLLECT.

02:01:29.482 --> 02:01:31.183
AND WE ALSO COLLECTED IN THE

02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:33.019
LEVEL WE ALSO REQUIRE THE

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:34.654
OFFICE LEVEL SO THEY'RE GONNA

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:36.689
WIND AND THEN THAT HAPPENS WHEN

02:01:36.756 --> 02:01:38.324
YOU GRANT THEN YOU HAVE A

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:40.459
LITTLE BIT DOES LAW OFFICES AND

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:42.061
WE DO REQUIRE ON THE MULTIPLE

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:43.362
VICTIMS AND THE MULTIPLE

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:45.231
OFFENSES BUT IT STILL ACCOUNTS

02:01:45.297 --> 02:01:47.299
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A COUNT

02:01:47.366 --> 02:01:48.801
OF HOW MANY HATE CRIME INCIDENT

02:01:48.868 --> 02:01:53.939
THAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE.

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:55.608
IT'S AT THAT LEVEL. WHERE THE

02:01:55.675 --> 02:01:56.742
NUMBER THAT'S HAPPENED YOU CAN

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:57.877
ALSO LOOK AT THE NUMBER VICTIMS

02:01:57.943 --> 02:01:59.278
RAMBLE AND THEN OF OFTEN. WHERE

02:01:59.345 --> 02:02:01.580
WE DO WE THAT INFORMATION IS. I

02:02:01.647 --> 02:02:02.982
