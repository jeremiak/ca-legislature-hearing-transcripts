THE FIRE AND NUMBER STAFF AND HE FOR US. AB. TWENTY OF CHINA AMERICA THERE WE GO OKAY THANK YOU CHAIR- COMMITTEE STAFF COLLEAGUES MEMBERS AND THOSE WATCHING BY TELEVISION- AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES BASED ON THEIR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL ENSURES WORKING FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION TO DEAL WITH UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES STICKS CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS CLOSURES OF SCHOOLS OR OTHER CARE FACILITIES. FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION OCCURS WHEN AN EMPLOYER TAKES A NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT ACTION AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE TO CARE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER THIS INCLUDES MOTHERS AND FATHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN PREGNANT BREAST FEEDING PEOPLE AND EMPLOYEES WITH AGING PARENTS SIX PALACES OR PARTNERS THAT MAY ENCOUNTER FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION MOST EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE CARE GIVERS. AT SOME POINT IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL HOWEVER WORKING MOTHERS AND PREGNANT PEOPLE ARE MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION WITH LOW WAGE EARNERS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR DISTRICT IMPACT. WHAT THE **** THERE'S WERE SET THE NINE CENTS LESS LIKE TO BE WRECKED FOR HIGHER HALF IS LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED AND OFFERED AN OF A THE DOLLARS LESS IN SALARY FOR THE SAME POSITION AS SIMILARLY QUALIFIED ON MOTHER'S EMPLOYEES ARE STRUGGLING TO BALANCE THEIR JOB A RISK OF THE SHOULD NOT. A REASON FOR TERMINATION OR OTHER ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION. EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS LIKE TERMINATION REFUSAL TO HIRE OR DEMOTION BASED ON. A BY ISSUES ABOUT HOW WORKERS WITH FAMILY CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES WILL OR SHOULD ACT WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR WORKERS PERFORMANCE THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS LIZ MORRIS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF HASTINGS CENTER FOR WORKLIFE LAW AND JULIA WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE RECEIVED GOOD MORNING I'M LIZ MORRIS I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR WORKLIFE LAW. AN ASTOUNDING NUMBER OF WORKERS LOST THEIR JOBS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BECAUSE OF THEIR CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES. UNDER KOPET WORKING PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO CARING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN THE ELDERLY AND FAMILY MEMBERS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE FACED HEART WRENCHING CHOICES. BETWEEN PROVIDING ADEQUATE CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES AND KEEPING THE PAYING JOBS THAT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE. THESE CHOICES ARE NOT NEW DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FAMILY CARE GIVERS EXISTED LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE UNLESS WE TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS IT NOW. BIAS AGAINST MOTHERS IS THE STRONGEST FORM OF BIAS AGAINST WOMEN AT WORK IT'S LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GENDER PAY GAP. WOMEN OF COLOR SINGLE MOTHERS IMMIGRANTS AND WORKERS IN LOW PAYING JOBS FACE THE HARSHEST IMPACTS. WHEN MOTHERS ARE FIRED OR UNABLE TO WORK BECAUSE OF THEIR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES THEIR CHILDREN SUFFER WITH FOOD AND- HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER PLAGUES OF POVERTY. SADLY CALIFORNIA HAS FALLEN BEHIND NATIONALLY IN ADDRESSING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MOTHERS FATHERS AND ALL FAMILY CAREGIVERS. ROUGHLY 30% OF THE AMERICAN WORK FORCE IS ALREADY PROTECTED BY A STATE OR LOCAL LAW THAT PROHIBITS THIS FORM OF DISCRIMINATION. AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE OTHER STATES SHOWS THAT FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES DISCRIMINATION LAWS WORK FOR EMPLOYEES AND BUSINESSES ALIKE. BY ENCOURAGING EMPLOYERS TO TREAT FAMILY CAREGIVERS BASED ON THEIR JOB PERFORMANCE INSTEAD OF BIAS WHICH HAS THE POWER TO BOTH SAVE JOBS AND AVOID LAWSUITS. I TWO THOUSAND A TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT FROM THE CENTER FOR WORKLIFE LAW FOUND THAT THE LIKELIHOOD AN EMPLOYER WILL BE SUED IS ZERO POINT 0001% AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO IS IMPERATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY BECAUSE IT WILL ENSURE FAMILY CARE GIVERS ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE WORK FORCE. FOR FAILING FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES IS NOT A PRIVATE FROLIC IT'S THE HARD AND NECESSARY WORK OF CARING FOR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND RAISING THE NEXT GENERATION OF WORKERS THAT WILL KEEP OUR ECONOMY GOING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JULIA PERISH I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK. A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT THAT HAS BEEN ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WITH LOW INCOMES FOR OF A HUNDRED YEARS. AND PROUD CO SPONSOR OF MAYBE TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLANT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES OR THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS- FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE WE PROVIDE FREE LEGAL SERVICES WE HEAR DIRECTLY FROM FAMILIES FACING BARRIERS AT WORK AND STRUGGLING BECAUSE OF THE CARE OBLIGATIONS. IN SOME CARE GIVERS WHO NEED SMALL. TO THEIR WORK BUT ARE DENIED THE REALITY FOR THESE WORKERS. ESPECIALLY FOR LOW PAID WORKERS IS THAT THEY CAN BE FIRED IF THEY ARE LATE ONE TIME IF THEY HAVE AN EMERGENCY AND MISS A DAY AND THAT CAN SEND ENTIRE FAMILIES. PUSH THEM DOWN DEEPER INTO POVERTY THE CONSEQUENCES ARE REAL AND WE MUST ADDRESS THEM. WE SAW AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR FAMILY CARE GIVING DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WE SAW THE RESULTS. WOMEN WERE FORCED FROM THE WORKPLACE IN LARGE NUMBERS CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WOMEN WERE TWICE AS LIKELY AS MEN TO SAY THEY LEFT WORK FOR CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES. DUE TO CHILD CARE OR PER CHILD CARE PROVIDER OR SCHOOL CLOSURES. FOR EXAMPLE ONE MOM WHO HAS A SPECIALIZED NURSING CARE FOR HER DAUGHTER BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER RIFAAT RELIES ON A VENTILATOR IN ORDER DAUGHTER THAT IN THE ON. MOM REQUEST AN ACCOMMODATION BUT SHE WAS FIRED. WOMEN OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN LOWER PAYING JOBS WTH FEWER. AND HOW LAST ACCESS HEALTHCARE. PLANS LESS EMERGENCE CHILDCARE WHY AT THE SAME TIME MORRIBLE AND THE MOTHER ARE THE- READ. FOR THEIR COMPUTER WHAT MONTHS. UNLESS WE ADDRESS THIS. OF TO FAIL PORTABLE IS. CONTENT YOU TABLE. COLOR FAMILY. MOREOVER WORKPLACE ACCOMMODATION ARE FEES. EMPLOYERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO. ANY ACCOMMODATION THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE OR THAT WOULD IMPOSE AN UNDUE BURDEN. THIS IS A STANDARD THAT EMPLOYERS ARE FAMILIAR WITH FROM OTHER CONTEXTS INCLUDING DISABILITY ACCOMMODATIONS. I ALSO WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS AND ACCOMMODATIONS REQUESTS. THE IRAQ THE ACCOMMODATION REQUEST DOES TRIGGER THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS AND THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS CONSIDER AND RESPOND TO THE REQUEST BUT IT DOES NOT NEED TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE NEED FOR ACCOMMODATION ARISES THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS DOES NOT NEED TO BE LONG AND DRAWN OUT AND IS OFTEN QUITE INFORMAL- THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ARE.

FAILUE ENGAGE IN INTERNET PROCESS OR ALLEGE INSUFFICIENT PROCESS IS GROUNDS FOR ITS OWN SEPARATE CAUSE OF ACTION. FURTHER THE DEFINITIONS OF FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES EXTREMELY BROAD IT WOULD APPLY TO ANYONE WITH A CHILD UNDER EIGHTEEN. ANYONE WHO CARES FOR SOMEONE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD AND THAT ANYONE CARES FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. THE FAMILY MEMBERS NOT ACTUALLY LIMITED TO A FAMILY MEMBER IT INCLUDES ANYONE OF THE EMPLOYEES CHOOSING. ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS ABOUT ONE THIRD OF WORKERS HAVE A CHILD UNDER EIGHTEEN WHEN YOU ADD IN THESE OTHER GROUPS OF PEOPLE YOU GET CLASS IT IS QUITE BROAD. MAKING IT VERY EASY TO TRY AND CLEAN THE ANY ADVERSE ACTION WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN BASED ON FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES NOT JOB PERFORMANCE OR ANOTHER REASON. AND FOR THE RIGHT I THINK THIS BILL WE'RE PUTTING ANOTHER VAGUE MANDATE AND- EMPLOYERS THAT. THE SORE OF LITIGATION THE OFF A LOT YEAR THAT MISSION WHEN PREVALENT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IN STATE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS RUBBERMAID FOR CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWO TWO FOUR THREE I'M BEFORE I TOUCH INTO CONCERNS ON A FLIGHT WE'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AT SOME LENGTH AND APPRECIATE THOSE TALKS- WE HOPE TO MOVE FORWARD OF IT WITH THEM- BRIEFLY I WANNA A FLAG THAT THE MUCH OF THE TESTIMONY HAS FOCUSED ON THE CHANGES TO THE OUTDOOR HEAT REGULATION THAT CORPORATE IN THE BILL. MOST OF OUR CONCERNS COME WITH THE OTHER PORTIONS OF THE BILL THE BILL ACTUALLY TOUCHES ON MULTIPLE REGULATIONS MAKING CHANGES ARE CONCERNED CHANGES RATHER TO THE OUTDOOR HEAT REGULATION AS WELL AS THE WILDFIRE SMOKE REGULATION AS WELL AS PROPOSING THREE NEW REGULATIONS FOCUSED ON A COMBINATION OF HEATING PIECE RIGHT. MOST CONCERNED HIS MANAGER. AND TIME- I DID GET IN CONTACT WITH THE WALL. FIRE SMOKE STANDARD. DOES CONTACT HERE. AE THE WILD FIRE SMOKE STANDARD PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE- EMPLOYEES ALREADY ENTITLED AND NINETY FIVE MASK. AT ONE STAGE YOU AYE HITS ONE FIFTY. SO ADDING THERE WAS SOME TESTIMONY AS TO ACCESS ISSUES. EMPLOYEES ALREADY ENTITLED TO THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SAYS IT WOULD LOWER THE MAXIMUM PRECAUTION THRESHOLD TO TWO HUNDRED. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MAXIMUM PRECAUTION THRESHOLD ON THE REST OF REGULATION. IS WHEN EMPLOYEES MUST WEAR AND NINETY FIVES AND ALSO MUST BE FIT TESTED IN MEDICALLY EVALUATED FOR THEIR NINETY FIVE WHICH INCLUDES. WHICH WOULD CONCERNED PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF YOU MUST SHAVE YOUR FACE A FIT TEST IN NINETY FIVE. THIS WAS EXTENSIVELY DISCUSSED AT THE CALIFORNIA MEETINGS ON THIS REGULATION. AND I WOULD SAY THIS ONE THE K. WHICH- CHOOSE. A LOW LEVEL OF ACCESS TO NINETY FIVE AT ONE FIFTY. BUT A HIGH LEVEL FOR MANDATORY USAGE AT FIVE HUNDRED- WE GREAT CONCERN THIS BILL WOULD REWRITE THAT BALANCE. BUT DIGNIFY LOW. AND ALSO CREATE POTENTIAL COMPETITION ISSUES FOR NINETY FIVE. WITH THE INDUSTRIES THAT I THINK WE ALSO COME OUT LAST TWO YEARS. REALLY THE FRONT LINE HA HOSPITALS AND OTHERS BY GREATLY LOWERING THAT THRESHOLD WE'VE- I'M RACES THE OTHERS OFF AS WE LOOK FOR TO TALKING ON IT.% I DON'T LIKE TO FOR- OR NUMBER THANK HELLO. PROPOSED IN TALKS THE LAW NUMBER OSHA FORWARD DRAFT ANY POINT WAS A FIVE. HUNDRED FOR MAXIMUM THRESHOLD. THIS BILL GOES BELOW THAT- I'D ALSO LIKE TO FLAG- AS TO THE THREE PROPOSED OTHER REGULATIONS THIS BILL FLEISCHER CONSIDERATION WHICH IS I. P. STRAIGHT INTO HEAT RELATED STANDARDS RELATED TO TRAINING AT FIRST DATE- IT IS OFF OF REVIEWING THE LEGISLATION AND WE FIGHT THIS IN A LETTER. ALL OF THOSE ISSUES RELATING TO FIRST AID AND TRAINING ARE COVERED IN EXISTING OUTDOOR HEAT REGULATION. THERE'S ALREADY MANDATORY TRAINING THERE WE HOPE TO DISCUSS WITH THE AUTHOR WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CHANGES BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY COVERED BY EXISTING REGULATION FOR OUR READ- AND THE LAST POINT AS THE PEACE RIVER BELIEVE THAT'S OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF CALLOSUM WHICH IS TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED ON. ON ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS AND NOT- KIND OF RATE OF WORK BUT WORK WE WILL TALK ON THAT POINT AS IT GOES FORWARD- FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWO TWO FOUR THREE. THANK YOU.

THIRTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MATTHEW ALLEN OF WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU. NOTATIONAL LINES AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WHAT WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES I'LL GO AHEAD AND COMMENT ONLY BECAUSE I'M- HE DARN FAMILIAR. WITH THE ISSUE OF FACEMASK FACE PIECES AND NINETY FIVE MASKS USED IN WILDLAND AND ALSO- IN IN OTHER ENVIRONMENTS- I CAN TELL YOU THE FIRST THING THAT MOST OF FIREFIGHTERS WANT TO DO WHEN A GUN FIRE IS- GET THAT MASK OFF SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO WORK- ESPECIALLY IN THE WILDLAND- IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. TO WEAR THAT MASK. AND BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE WORK BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING UP THE HILL WITH A HOSE PACK- YOU ARE CONSUMING A LOT OF- A LOT OF AIR AND YOUR BODY NEEDS A LOT OF OXYGEN AND WHEN YOU'RE RESTRICTING IT WITH THE MASK. BECAUSE NUMBER- EVERY OF MINUTES FOR MINUTES IN OTHER WORDS YOU WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT OSHO WAS RECOGNIZING WHEN THEY SET THE STANDARDS THAT THEY DO AN OSHA IS VERY VERY- THEY'RE VERY DILIGENT WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT STANDARDS IT'S VERY HARD TO THEM SOMETIMES WE FEEL THAT SOME OF THEIR STANDARDS ARE UNREASONABLE- THE TESTING FOR THESE IF IT'S NOT DONE CORRECTLY OPENS UP EVERY AGENCY TO LAWSUITS- AND IT'S NOT A- EASY PROCESS. IT'S NOT A CHEAP PROCESS IT'S VERY VERY COSTLY- AND HAS TO BE DONE ONCE A YEAR AND IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE PERSON HAS THE PROPER FIT IF THEY LOSE WEIGHT. OF THEIR OF CONFIGURATION INTERFACE CHANGES THEN THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AGAIN. SO YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC- I THINK OSHA SET STANDARDS FOR PURPOSE AND- I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO- TO NOT GO BEYOND AN OSHA. AND TRY TO LIVE. THESE TYPES SAFETY HAZARDS FROM FROM THE LEGISLATURE AS OPPOSED TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS ALL ABOUT WORKER SAFETY AND- SO FOR THAT REASON- I'M GONNA BE OPPOSING THE BILL. THANK YOU. REWARD THANK YOU ONE THINK THE AUTHOR BRING THIS BILL FOR NICE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE INTENT APPLAUDED. RECOGNITION THAT AS OUR CLIMATE CONTINUES TO CHANGE AND AS WE ARE FACED WITH NOT JUST A THREAT THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY BUT INCREASED THREATS- COMING OVER TIME- WORKING ON EXTREME HEAT ISSUES AND- REALLY WORKING ON ASKING- SAID TO UPDATE SOME OF THE STANDARDS I THINK IS THAT WHAT THIS BILL IS A TALENTED CATALYZE. I'M ENCOURAGED TO NOTE YOUR WORKING DETAILS- AND WE THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE PARTICULAR MATTER- ISSUES AND WE SEE YOU KNOW NUMBERS THAT ARE ON THERE REMINDING THEM A KEY ALLY. OF TWO HUNDRED- WAS A LITTLE BIT ABOVE WHAT I THINK WE WERE EVEN EXPERIENCING HERE DOWN THE SACRAMENTO BASIN. LAST SUMMER DURING THE CALDOR FIRES AND WE COULD SMELL THAT AND WE CONTAINS THAT. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A CONDITION THAT'S EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT AS WELL. I MEAN THIS IS ABOUT PROCRIT PREVENTING KNOW ARE GOING BE COMING FROM THE KINDS OF EXPOSURE- THIS ISN'T. TO ME FORWARD- BECAUSE I KNOW YOU GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON MUCH OF THIS DETAIL- BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT. THE WORKERS CONDITIONS SO THAT THEY CAN- WORK SUCCESSFULLY AND HEALTHFULLY IN IN WHAT MIGHT BE A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT RIGHT AROUND IS SOMETHING. THAT ALMOST EXCELLENT- ANY OTHER QUESTION I WOULD SAY LOOKING UP WOULD I I'D SERVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS ON OUR BAY AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT BOARD IT TEARS WELL EARNED A LOT ABOUT PM TWO POINT FIVE AND- DAMAGING IT IS AN FIVE IT IS A- VERY HIGH NUMBER. THERE MAY BE ARGUMENTS AS TO TWO HUNDRED WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT WAS NECESSARY BUT AND NINETY FIVE IS AN EXCELLENT. TRANSACTION A THAT PARTICULAR MATTER- AND THIS ISSUE AND IS FAR TOO. FAR TOO IMPORTANT- YOU KNOW FOR US TO NOT MOVE FORWARD ON AND I REALLY APPRECIATE FOR BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT THOSE THAT ARE. THERE AND THERE IS CHANGES BETWEEN A POINT AND I CAN BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. OF SOME OF THE FIREFOX OR SOME THAT'S A FARM. THAT'S A WILL BE THE DENTIST OF- EIGHT TEN HOURS AND- AND DIFFERENT EQUIPMENT THAN A FIREFIGHTER MAYBE. THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM OR- I'M THINKING ABOUT AFTER THE HORRIBLE FIRES IN PARADISE AND- MY IT'S ALL THESE INTERVIEWS OF THESE WOMEN THAT ARE GOING IN AND CLEANING UP AT THE- END OF THE OF THE SMOKE IN THE AIR. SO THESE THAT. ON A- I HOPE THAT AT LEAST OR ON THE SAME PAGE. THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE AND THAT THAT MORNING YOU DONE.

THESE METRICS WOULD THEN BE MADE AVAILABLE ON THE AGENCY'S WEBSITE WITH THE INTENT TO USE IT TO ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTER A HIGH ROAD EMPLOYERS PROGRAM IN WHICH QUALIFIED EMPLOYERS WOULD BE ENTITLED TO CERTAIN STATE BENEFITS. THIS BILL ADOPTS A KEY RECOMMENDATION BY THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION TO ADVANCE JOB QUALITY BY LINKING STATE SPENDING TO QUALITY JOB CREATION. WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. UNLIKE LAST YEAR AND BASED ON FEEDBACK RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WHO ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO CONTINUE MEETING WITH. AB TWENTY NINETY FIVE IS AN IMPROVED AND MORE BALANCED VERSION FIRST. AB TWENTY NINETY FIVE PROVIDES MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE HIGH ROAD EMPLOYERS PROGRAM. THIS INCLUDES LISTING EXAMPLES OF INCENTIVES SUCH AS PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS TAX EXPENDITURES AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDING. AS WELL AS SPECIFYING A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT INCLUDE BOTH BUSINESS AND LABOR TO PROVIDE INPUT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROGRAM. SECOND WELL EQUITY MEASURES WILL STILL BE REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED AND COUNTED TOWARDS AN EMPLOYER'S OVERALL SCORE. THIS RAW DATA WILL NOT BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE AGENCY'S WEBSITE. THIRD WE REMOVE METRICS THAT EXTENDED PAST STATE LAW. SUCH AS THAT OF EXEMPTED TEMPORARY STAFFING COMPANIES FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. ULTIMATELY AB TWENTY NINETY FIVE IS DESIGNED TO REWARD EXEMPLARY EMPLOYERS THAT ARE TREATING THEIR WORKERS WELL AN APPROACH THAT IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE STATED INTEREST A MAJOR BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE. WORKERS CONSUMER PAUL CONSUMERS POLICYMAKERS AND COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THESE BUSINESSES OPERATE ALL HAVE AN INTEREST IN SEEING HOW COMPANIES TREAT THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES ACCORDING TO A SET OF OBJECTIVE MEASURES. IT'S TIME WE DEVELOP A NEW SOCIAL COMPACT FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS BASED ON AN INCLUSIVE VISION IN WHICH EVERYONE SHARES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS INDIRA MCDONALD ON BEHALF OF THE BILL'S SPONSOR.% AND UP FELLOW MEMBER OF THE GOVERNOR'S SPEECH OF OUR COMMISSION A CALIFORNIA STATE CONTROLLER BETTY.

AN EASY TO READ NUTRITION LABELS FOR MAC WOULD MEASURE HOW A COMPANY MANAGES ITS GREATEST ASSET ITS WORK FORCE IN SERVE TO INFORM THE INTERESTS OF MAJOR BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS WORKERS CONSUMERS IN SERVICE LOCAL OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. PLEASE INFORMATION WILL HAVE. IMPACT YOUR MIND THE POISED TO DIRECT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CLEAN ENERGY TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER LARGE SCALE INITIATIVES. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE HUMAN OF THE HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT COALITION INCLUDING CO FOUNDERS PALLISTER'S IN CALPERS I'LL THE RULE MAKING PETITION UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. TO EXPLAIN OF THE INVESTOR CASE. THE DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY THE F. C. C. FINALIZE REGULATIONS TO REQUIRE HUMAN CAPITAL DISCLOSURE. HOWEVER THE RULE MAKING IS LIMITED IN SCOPE AND ALLOWS MANAGEMENT WIDE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHICH DATA IS REPORTED AND THE RULE DOES NOT REQUIRE A UNIFORM SET OF BASELINE INFORMATION. THAT IS CONSISTENT INCOME PARABLE. IN HELPING TO DEVELOP THIS BILL WE COLLABORATED WITH THE DRUNK THE DRUNKARD INSTITUTE AT CLAREMONT GRADUATE UNIVERSITY AND ROAD TESTED THE METRICS CONTAINED IN THE BILL WITH A HANDFUL OF LARGE COMPANIES TO ENSURE THE METRICS CAN BE RECORDED. WITH BURDEN. NATIONALLY WE ARE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION THIS BILL WOULD TAKE US FOR EXAMPLE THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SO IF YOU TAKE A STANDARDIZED DATA DRIVEN DISCLOSURE REGIME COVERING WAGES DIVERSITY.

GOOD AFTERNOON ACTUALLY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY NINETY FIVE AS A JOB KILLER I DO WANT TO FIRST OF COURSE THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE SPONSOR FOR ENGAGING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND WE DO INTEND TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGE WE DO REMAIN STRONGLY OPPOSED I'M ALL I DO NOT DOUBT THAT THE MOTIVATION BEHIND A LOT OF THIS IS TO IN FACT REWARD GOOD BUSINESSES ARE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THIS BILL IS REALLY GOING TO DO SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. THE STATED GOAL IS TO CREATE A RANKING SYSTEM TO COMPARE COMPANIES- INTO USE THAT RANKING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE WHO IS A HYBRID OR LOW ROAD EMPLOYER THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAIL PROVIDED BY THE STATE INTENT IS THAT THE RANKINGS WOULD BE USED TO DETERMINE WHICH COMPANIES ARE WORTHY OF STATE CONTRACTS TAX BENEFITS OR OTHER SAY OPPORTUNITIES. REALLY STATE REDDING. CAN THE BILL IT WILL BE LABOR UNION ACTED. AND OTHERS AND ONE PLAYER REP. ARE TECHNICAL INCLUDED. BASED ON EXPERIENCE WE DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THOSE VOICES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE HEARD. AND ALSO WON'T NECESSARILY BE THE STATE DECIDING WHO'S ENTITLED TO THE STATE OPPORTUNITIES. THE BILL PROVIDES OF THE STATE MY ACTUALLY CONTRACT THAT PIECE OUT TO UNIVERSITIES AND NONPROFITS SO THIS BILL IS TAKING A RANKING PROGRAM. BASICALLY PUTTING IT IN THE HANDS OF THEIR PARTIES NOT THE STATE. THE DATE OF THESE ARE COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT INCLUDES DATA FOR THEIR ENTIRE UNITED STATES WORKFORCE. WHICH WE DO NOT BELIEVE PROVIDES AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF HOW A COMPANY TREATS ITS EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYERS THE MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES IN STATES OF FLOOR MENTAL WAY TO LOWER COSTS OF LIVING. WILL LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE LOWER MEDIAN PAY COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS. AND EVEN IF ONLY LIMITED TO CALIFORNIA IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND A WAY TO ADEQUATELY AND FAIRLY COMPARE BUSINESSES ACROSS VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. EVERY COME. COULD BE TO ONE OF. SO WILL IN. BE BE PAINTED AS LOW ROAD EMPLOYERS. NOT ONLY WILL THOSE COMPANIES LOSE OUT ON STATE BENEFITS PLANS ATTORNEYS WILL SURELY COME KNOCKING ONCE THEY SEE THIS DATA. FOR EXAMPLE COMPANIES WITH HIGHER NUMBERS OF CONTRACTORS ARE SURE TO FACE MISS CLASSIFICATION CLAIMS. THE MEDIA WILL ALSO BE READY TO WRITE ITS HEADLINES AGAIN COMPANIES OF LOWER MEDIAN PAY THAN ITS PEERS EVEN IF THEY ARE DOING GREAT OVERALL. WILL MAKE THE HEADLINES REGARDLESS OF THE REASONING BEHIND THAT P. DATA OR WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE COMPARED TO OTHERS. FOR THIS REASON WE URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. YES RESEARCHER KRISTA KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE HOLLYWOOD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANYONE OPPOSITION SEEN NONE COMMITTEE A QUESTION FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SOME SORT OF GOT A COMMENT QUESTION SO. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR BUSINESS CLIMATE. AND IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT JUST READ IT RETAINING THE EMPLOYERS THAT WE HAVE AND WE'VE HAD AN ACCIDENT OF SOME PRETTY STRONG EMPLOYERS. IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS BUT IT'S ALSO THE ATTRACTION OF THOSE TYPE OF EMPLOYERS IN THOSE TYPE OF EMPLOYER THAN TALKING ABOUT ARE THE ONES THAT CAN BRING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF JOBS. TO COMMUNITIES AND TWO REGIONS THAT NEED MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF JOBS IN ORDER FOR US TO BALANCE OUT OUR COMMUTING- OUR OUR HOUSING NEEDS ALL OF THESE THINGS DEPEND ON THIS BALANCE. AND IT WHEN I SEE MEASURES LIKE THIS- AND WHILE IT MAY BE THE FIRST IN THE NATION I ALSO SEE THAT IS WHERE THE GUINEA PIGS. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO BEGINNING PEGS ANYMORE- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO ATTRACTING BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THANK AND IT TRACKING CORPORATIONS THAT BRING THOUSANDS OF JOBS HERE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU PILE SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON TOP OF ALL OF THE OTHER REPORTING AND REGULATIONS AND SHAMING AND ALL THESE OTHER REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE WE WALKED UP WITH NOTES THANKS AND THE ONLY JOBS WE DO HAVE. OUR LOWER LEVEL RETAIL TYPE JOBS THAT DON'T PAY PEOPLE ENOUGH TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES AND SO WHEN I SEE. THE MEASURES LIKE THIS THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE WE ARE DRIVING A WEDGE BETWEEN US AND ALL THESE OTHER KIDS ALL THESE OTHER STATES. OUR TRACTOR THE- THAT WE SHOULD BE JUST BY THE NATURE OF CALIFORNIA BEING WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT HAS TO OFFER PEOPLE- WE'RE BECOMING LESS AND LESS COMPETITIVE YEAH AND I DON'T THINK THIS HELPS IN THAT RESPECT- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT. OUR OUR PEOPLE TO TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES WELL IN A LOT OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT SOME OF THIS IS AIMED AT A REALLY GOOD EMPLOYERS. YOU SHOULD HEAR SOME OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES GET THERE ALL THE THINGS THAT WE TALK ABOUT HERE. BUT THE MORE WE DO THIS THE LAST DECISION WHEN THEY HAVE A LIST OF FIVE PLACES TO GO SET UP THEIR CORPORATION OR THE COMPANY OR THEIR EXPANSION. THAT LIST MORE MORE EXCLUDES CALIFORNIA AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M I'M OPPOSING THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE FROM THE COMMITTEE. CNN VISITORS CHAIR WHICH I CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IS INDICATED YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN AMENDMENTS SINCE LAST YEAR- TO NOT REQUIRE COMPANIES REPORT ON DATA NOT REQUIRED BY LAW WHICH WAS AND IT WAS ONE OF THE CRITICISMS FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- IT TO NOT HAVE THE DATA PUBLICLY DISCLOSED- THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT THOUSAND AND MORE- EMPLOYEES THEY ALREADY HAVE. PERSONNEL THE ARCTIC SHOT THIS DATA AND I KNOW THAT- CONTROL YOU HE'S BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE WONDERFUL COMPANIES- THAT ARE HEARINGS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE VERY INTERESTED IN- IN THIS PROCESS AS WELL AS THE BY ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF AGAIN CREATING INCENTIVES FOR HYBRID EMPLOYMENT. AND YOU KNOW THE TALKING POINT THAT SOMEHOW CALIFORNIA DRIVE AWAY JOBS THE DATA SHOWS OUR ECONOMY IS THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD IT'S GOTTEN THAT WAY OVER THE LAST FOUR DECADES AS WE'VE ALSO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE AS WE'VE ALSO HAD BETTER WHAT WORK AND SAFETY STANDARDS YOU CAN DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS YOU COULD BE A GREAT PLACE FOR EMPLOYERS.

RECLASSIFIED ASEMPLOYEES THROUGH A STAFFING AGENCY TO REDUCE THEIR WORKERS COMPENSATION POLICY COSTS. THERE ARE SOME STAFFING AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE CREATED A NICHE. INDUSTRY BY SELLING THEIR ABILITY TO LOWER EMPLOYERS WORKERS COMP COST. THEY DO THIS BY ASSUMING EMPLOYEES FROM CLIENTS EMPLOYERS WITH BAD TO WORKERS COMP RATINGS. THE EMPLOYEE THEN HAS A LOWER WORKERS COMP PAYMENT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT WITH THE EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY DOES FOR A LIVING. INSTEAD OF WORKING TO GET A BETTER WORKERS COMP RATING BY REDUCING WORKPLACE INJURIES. THESE BAD ACTORS EMPLOYER BAD ACTOR EMPLOYERS ARE USING THIS LOOPHOLE TO AVOID HIRE WORKERS COMP COSTS. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY STATE THAT IN CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS OR CATEGORIES. THE EMPLOYER HAS TO BE THE ONE TO PROVIDE THE WORKERS COMP COVERAGE. IF IT IS THEIR CORE BUSINESS.

OUR CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS REALLY FOCUSED ON ONE PIECE WHICH IS THE ONGOING PROMISES WIDE NOTICE THE MUST BE GIVEN AS WELL ON WITHIN ONE BUSINESS DAY WE BELIEVE THAT THAT PIECE REALLY DOESN'T. ISN'T NECESSARY GOING FORWARD I'LL GET INTO WHY BUT AS TO THE NOTICE TO COUNTIES AND CLOSE CONTACT TRACING RIGHT NOSE NOTICES. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE OPPOSED TO HEAR- SO I THINK THAT THE REAL ISSUE KEY ISSUE FOR US IS THIS. WE ARE NOT OF THE SAME SITUATION WE WERE IN THIS BILL IS PASSED IN TWENTY TWENTY. WE HAVE VACCINATION NOW WE HAVE A HIGH VACCINATION RATE RELATIVELY NATIONWIDE RELATIVELY HIGH. THAT WAS NOT IN THE FACT THAT- THANKFULLY WE HAVE RETROVIRAL DRUGS THAT ARE BETTER WE- DISTRICT. AND HOSPICE RAISE THE GUN DOWN. THEY'RE TREATING THIS. WE ALSO HAVE A GOVERNOR NOTING THAT WE THE STATE IS MOVING TOWARDS AN ENDEMIC STATUS. I WHICH WAS DENOUNCED I BELIEVE SIX WEEKS AGO. SO WE REALLY LOOK AT THIS AS A POINT WHERE TO SAY HERE WE HOPE THAT THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WE CAN FIND AN APPROPRIATE SHIFT DOWNWARD AS YOU MAKE THAT TRANSITION- I'D LIKE TO- YOUR- THE OTHER POINT I MAKE AND I TOTALLY AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU EXPERIENCE THIS IS THAT THESE PROMISES WHITE NOTICES THE MUST. AND ON THE- HAVE. ANY OF MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES REALLY BECOME JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF ANOTHER PIECE OF SPAM THEY RECEIVE EVERY DAY THAT THEY DON'T READ. AND TO THAT POINT I THINK THAT UNDERLIES A LARGER CAN A LARGER CHANGE IN. FOCUS WHICH IS. HEARING THERE IS A CASE IN THE WORKPLACE THE PASSED THROUGH THE WORKPLACE NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS IN TWENTY TWENTY. RIGHT THOSE WERE TREATED DIFFERENTLY WE REACTED DIFFERENTLY NOW I THINK THE PERCEPTION OF RISK. ACCURATELY AMONGST THIS THING AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE IS DIFFERENT. AND I THINK THAT OUR GOALS OF THIS NOTICE REFLECT THAT CHANGE IN PERCEPTION AND CHANGE IN SCIENCE- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE.

TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THEIR OWN PRECAUTIONS WHAT ALL THINGS ARE BETTER ACROSS THE BOARD PRESS FORTUNATE. YOUR HAVE IN THIS WAY. AS A POSITIVE CHOICE DO. A TAPER. IN THE FORMS OF VACCINATION. OR MASKING OR WHATEVER ELSE THEY CHOOSE- KNOWING THAT- ARMS AND JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO BE ABLE TO HOW THEY SHOULD RESPOND ON THEIR DATE. THE BUSINESS- AND AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE VARIANTS COMING GO.

THAT GETS OUR ATTENTION RIGHT AND THEN PEOPLE CAN DECIDE HOW THEY WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT OBVIOUSLY WAS A LARGER SITUATION THAN AN EMPLOYER WILL TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS. THE RIGHT TO KNOW. ASIDE THEY WANT RESPOND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN A I THINK OBJECTIVELY BETTER SITUATION NOW. THAN WE WERE IN THE PAST WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AROUND THE CORNER AND CERTAINLY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRPERSON AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BERS. ESTABLISHED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE SEVEN YEAR STATUTE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PROTECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS FROM BEING TRAPPED IN LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS BY PROHIBITING. THESE CONTRACTS A LASTING NO LONGER THAN SEVEN YEARS. THE ABILITY TO TERMINATE A PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT UP FOR SEVEN YEARS. ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO SEEK NEW EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBTAIN IMPROVED TERMS WITH THEIR CURRENT EMPLOYER. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE RECORDING INDUSTRY LOBBY TO EFFECTIVELY EXCLUDE RECORDING ARTIST FROM SECTION TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE PROTECTIONS ARGUING THAT RECORD COMPANIES MADE LARGE INVESTMENTS OR ARTIST'S CAREER BASED PRIMARILY ON THE PROMISE THAT THE APPLE DELIVER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ALBUMS UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE MUSIC BUSINESS HAS ALSO UNDERGONE MASSIVE CHANGES DUE TO DIGITAL MEDIA AND ONLINE STREAMING. RECORD LABEL CENTER PROFIT ENORMOUSLY FROM THE JUDICIAL POP ONES BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION DISTRICT ASSOCIATED DEVELOPING AN ARTIST. IS ONLY A FRACTION OF WHAT IT USED TO BE. DESPITE THESE GAINS RECORDING CONTRACTS REMAIN OUTDATED THE TERMS FAVORING THE RECORD LABELS. IN THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY MANY ACTORS AND UNDER ARE UNDER EXCLUSIVE CONTRACTS PROHIBIT THEM FOR PERFORMING OR FINDING WORK IN BETWEEN SESSIONS IN BETWEEN SEASONS. THE ADVENT OF NEW HOMES OF CONTENT DISTRIBUTION LIKE STREAMING SERVICES HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED PRODUCTION SCHEDULES ELIMINATING THE ABILITY OF ANNUAL WORK SCHEDULES. THAT INCLUDED CONSISTENT WORK FOR NINE MONTHS AND ONLY SHORT BREAKS BETWEEN SEASONS. TODAY MANY TV AND NEW MEDIA SERVICE SURE APOSTLES FOR ONLY FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS PER SEASON I BELIEVE ACTORS ON HOLD DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR WITHOUT WORK AND PAY. ACTORS AND RECORDING ARTISTS HAVE LIMITED WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE THEIR CRAFT- LIVING AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. PROHIBITIOS ON THEIR ABILITY TO WORK BETWEEN THE TELEVISION SEASONS OR BETWEEN RECORDS LEAVE NO ROOM TO ESTABLISH AND SUSTAIN A CAREER. RECORDING ARTIST AND ACTRESS PUT FOR TO LONG HAVE BEEN HELD UNDER THE CONTROL OF INDUSTRY WHO HAS ALL THE LEVERAGE AND THE SIZE THEIR ABILITY TO WORK AND THEIR CAREERS AS AN ARTIST. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX THE FREE THIS FROM INDUSTRY RESTRICTIONS ACT OR FAIR ACT GIVES SOME OF THAT CONTROL BACK TO THE WORKERS LONG OF THE RESULTANT CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH THEIR EMPLOYER. ALL PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS WILL STILL BE BOUND BY CONTRACTUAL TERMS. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX WEEKS TO PUT AN END TO SOME OF THE MOST UNFAIR PRACTICES THAT STUDIOS AND RECORD LABELS USED. TO UNILATERALLY HOLD ARTISTS OFF THE JOB MARKET FOR UNREASONABLE PERIODS OF TIME OR RESTRICT THEIR FREEDOM TO WORK. I HAVE HAD PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE OPPOSITION CRITIC WITH THE RECORDING INDUSTRY AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE THESE TALKS WITH THE BILL PASSED TO THE ARTS COMMITTEE WITH ALL OPPOSITION. WOULD BE REVIVED TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. ARE YOUR FOR GOOD WHEN ACTRESS THE REPRESENTATIVE A SAG AFTRA. AND WILL THE PROFITS DIGGERS AND ACTIVISTS AND MUSIC EXECUTIVE WITH THE BLACK MUSIC UP UP WITH BLACK MUSIC ACTION COALITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR TO FIRST WITH US PLEASE. HI I'M JENNIFER GOODWIN I AM A FILM AND TELEVISION ACTRESS AND MY CAREER INCLUDES PROJECTS LIKE HBO'S BIG LOVEABC'S ONCE UPON A TIME. AND I VOICE JUDY HOPPS IN THE DISNEY ANIMATED FEATURES UTOPIA. I HAVE SUPPORTED MYSELF AS AN ACTRESS FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THAT PHRASE I JUST USED I SUPPORT MYSELF I HAVE SUPPORTED MYSELF AS AN ACTRESS. I AM A BREADWINNER. AND MORE MEANINGFULLY I'M ALSO A MOTHER AND A WIFE AND MY HUSBAND ACTOR JOSH DALLAS IS ALSO A BREADWINNER. BECAUSE THESE DAYS WE NEED AS MANY BREADWINNERS AS WE CAN GET. MY HUSBAND HAS TAKEN A JOB LIVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM US HIS FAMILY SO THAT WE CAN PAY FOR OUR HOUSE. CHILD CARE AND SCHOOL TUITION. THIS SITUATION PUTS ME IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO SPEAK ABOUT PERFORMERS RIGHTS. I'M HERE TO PUT A FACE ON AN ISSUE THAT HAS REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES FOR ARTISTS AND THOSE WHO RELY ON US THE CALIFORNIA FAIRFAX THE FREE ARTISTS FROM INDUSTRY RESTRICTIONS ACT AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX. THIS IS APPROPRIATELY NAMED BECAUSE IN THIS WORLD WHERE STUDIOS STREAMING SERVICES AN INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS HAVE THE FREEDOM TO CREATE ANYTHING THEY WANT. IT IS THE VERY PERFORMERS TO FILL THOSE SCREENS WHO ARE DENIED THE FREEDOM TO WORK. WE ARE IN SHORT REFUSED. E. SENSUAL WORKER MOBILITY PROTECTION. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BOTH IN RECENT YEARS NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS FOR INDIVIDUAL TELEVISION SEASONS. FIRST SERIES COMPRISED OF TWENTY TWO EPISODES OUTDATED NETWORK STANDARD MY SERIES LIKE MOST OTHER SERIES WAS PICKED UP FOR ONLY TEN EPISODES MY HUSBAND CHAU HAS BEEN PICKED UP ANNUALLY FOR TEN TO SIXTEEN EPISODES DEPENDING ON THE YEAR AND WE ARE NOT COMPENSATED FOR THE EPISODES WE CANNOT ON BUT WHICH WE NEVER SHOOT AND GUESS WHAT. WE ARE FORCED TO SIT AND WAIT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR OR MAYBE THE STUDIO'S EXTENDER CONTRACTS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO THAT MAYBE IT'S A YEAR AND A HALF. WE ARE FORCED TO SIT AND WAIT UNEMPLOYABLE BY OTHERS BECAUSE- WHAT IF THOSE WHO WILL THE CENTER CONTRACT DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO SHOOT ANOTHER SEASON. WE ARE CAPPED OFF THE MARKET NOW SOME OF OUR BOSSES. HIM WE WILL CALL ORIGINAL EMPLOYERS. ASSERTS THAT THERE ACTORS ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE WHAT WE WILL CALL OTHER JOBS DURING OUR HOLDING PERIODS. AS LONG AS SAID OTHER JOBS ARE DEEMED NON COMPETITIVE PROJECTS IN WE WILL NOT WASTE OUR TIME UNPACKING OUT HERE TODAY IT'S SUCH A RIDICULOUS CONCEPT WHAT WE WILL SAY IS OTHER JOBS. WON'T TOUCH PERFORMERS WELL WE ARE HELD UNDER CONTRACT BY ORIGINAL EMPLOYERS ANYWAY. WHY WOULD OTHER JOBS HIRE US. ORIGINAL EMPLOYERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO PULL US OFF OF OTHER JOBS THAT AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT. SHUTTING DOWN OTHER JOBS AND POTENTIALLY COSTING THEM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OTHER JOBS HAVE NO INTEREST IN THAT LEGAL NIGHTMARE AND AVAILABILITY RISK. AND I DON'T BLAME THEM SO HERE WE ARE. WE ARE ACTORS AND SNARED IN AN UNFAIR EXCLUSIVITY CLAUSE WHICH IS ONLY A REMNANT OF THE DAYS WHEN STUDIOS CONTROL THE LIVES OF PERFORMERS. NO CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATURE BEGAN DISMANTLING THAT SYSTEM ALMOST EIGHTY YEARS AGO. THERE IS STILL SO MUCH PROGRESS TO BE MADE. AS A CALIFORNIA I ASK YOU TO TAKE A STAND FOR THE CREATIVE WORKERS TO THRIVE HERE TO FILL YOUR SCREENS WHO HELPED MAKE THE STATE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS LED THE WAY AND IN KEEPING I ASK YOU TO PLEASE PASS THE CALIFORNIA FAIR ACT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR ASKING HE BECOMES A TWO MINUTES PLEASE. EXILE PROFITS FIGURES AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUSIC COMMUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT. FOR AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX THE FAIR AT. CALIFORNIA HAS A STRONG TRADITION OF PROTECTING CITIZENS CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION TWENTY FIFTY FIVE KNOWN AS THE SEVEN YEAR STATUTE CALIFORNIA PROTECTED EVERYONE FROM BEING TRAPPED IN UNFAIR PROTRACTED CONTRACTS. FOR DECADES ALL CALIFORNIANS WERE TREATED EQUALLY TO SEEK SHELTER. FROM DISPATCHING BY THE EIGHTEEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE MAJOR LABEL USED THEIR POWER TO AMEND THE SEVEN YEAR STATUTE AND EFFECTIVELY EXCLUDING ALL THIS FROM THE STATUES PROTECTION THAT WAS WRONG. AND UNFAIR. ARE THESE SHOULD NOT SHOULD RECEIVE THE SAME PROTECTION AS EVERY THER CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THE THREE MAJOR LABELS WERE COLLECTIVELY VALUED AT A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TO RECEIVE MORE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT THE OTHER EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE LET ME DISPEL ONE MYTH LABEL DO NOT MAKE UP FOR INVESTMENTS THAT COVER MULTIPLE ALBUMS RECORD CONTRACTS ARE PAY AS YOU GO MODEL WILL LABELS UNILATERALLY DECIDE WHETHER TO MOVE AHEAD OR NOT. IT IS IT IF THE LABEL IS MAKING MONEY THE DROP THE ARMY'S IN THAT IN THE IN IN THE N THE INVESTMENT KEEP IN MIND THAT THE LABEL STILL OWNS AND EXPORTS THE OTHERS COPY RIGHT AFTER WE ARE THIS IS GOING TO RESULT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHANGE RECORD CONTRACTS WITH THE LATE TODAY ARE INDENTURED SERVITUDE IS THAT SIMPLE THE TERM FOR RECORD CONTRACTS ARE EQUITABLE BECAUSE THE LABELS HAVE ALL OF THE POWER AND WITHOUT THE- NOPE MY- THE BILL. OR LOSE THEIR PROTECTION AS A RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA. FOR FINANCIAL GAINS FOR RECORD COMPANIES. THIS IS THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL AND RACIAL JUSTICE THE MAJORITY OF OUR THESE DRIVING PROFITS TODAY ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE HEADS OF THE MAJOR LABELS AND BOARD MEMBERS WHO BENEFIT FROM THOSE PROFITS ARE NOT. COMING TODAY REPRESENT OUR THIS THAT MAKE THE MUSIC THAT WE ALL LOVE THE FILM THAT HAS THE SUPPORT OF ALL OF THE GROUPS REPRESENTING WORKING MUSICIANS BLACK MUSIC ACTION COALITION CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF LABOR THE MUSIC ARTISTS COALITION THE RECORDING ACADEMY AT AFRO SO NOT AMONG OTHER THINGS THE ONLY OPPOSITION TO THE FACT OTHER MAJOR LABELS WHO ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO HOLD IT TO A SYSTEM THAT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE THEIR POCKETS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PROMISE WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR THIS ASSEMBLY. TO FIX ALL ALL. OF THE- WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU TO RESTORE JUSTICE TO PREVIOUS PRESIDENT'S OF THE STATE. THANK YOU SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

THANKS TOTALING EIGHTY NINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS NOT IT HE ON BEHALF OF AN OUTSPOKEN TALENT IN SUPPORT. HELLO ADDITIONAL LINES AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE MOVED OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX OPPOSITION COME UP. TO SEE WHAT. JUST OF THE OPPOSITION AS WE RAN A LITTLE BIT LONG ON ON THE SUPPORT SO GIVE ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES TO JUST CAN MAKE UP FOR THAT TIME AS WELL. SO SEVEN MINUTES MY THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S MITCH GLAZIER AND THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF THE RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE EIGHT NINE TWENTY SIX. I SPEAK ABOUT THE WORK SOME RECORDING SIDE OF THE BILL AND THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL DON'T ADDRESS THE EXAMPLES THAT ARE ADVANCE BUT THE SUPPORTERS BUT IT WILL HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONSEQUENCES WHEN HIS MUSIC COMMUNITY. AND ECONOMY TODAY RECORDING ARTISTS ENJOY THE ADVANCES AND ROYALTIES IN HISTORY. WITH GREATER CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITIES AND MORE PATHWAYS TO THEIR FANS AND THE SUCCESS THAN EVER. AND THAT'S BECAUSE CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBLE CUSTOMIZED MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN ARTISTS AND LABELS. AND ENCOURAGES RISK TAKING AND INVESTMENT IN NEW AND RISING ARTISTS. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX DECIMATES THIS MUTUALLY REWARDING SYSTEM BENEFITING A FEW SUPERSTAR ARTISTS. BY SHIFTING INCOME INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AWAY FROM DEVELOPING ARTISTS. IT'S SIMPLY UNTRUE THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES NEW PROTECTION TO ARTISTS UNDER CALIFORNIA SEVEN YEAR RULE. CAN ALREADY FROM ANY RECORDING AGREEMENT AFTER SEVEN YEARS AND I THINK THAT BEARS REPEATING ARTISTS CAN ALREADY UNDER CURRENT LAW WALK AWAY FROM ANY RECORDING AGREEMENT AFTER SEVEN YEARS. THE BILL SIMPLY ELIMINATES THE LABELS RECOURSE WHEN AN ARTIST HASN'T DELIVERED THE RECORDINGS THEY AGREED TO MAKE AND WERE PAID FOR DURING THAT TIME. THAT'S A PRETTY RADICAL AND UNSUSTAINABLE NOTION TO TAKE AWAY ONE SIDE'S ABILITY TO ENFORCE A CONTRACT EFFECTIVELY RENDERING IT VOID. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX ALSO PLACES SEVERE AND UNPRECEDENTED RESTRICTIONS ON ARTIS. IT'LL HAMPER THEIR ABILITY TO RENEGOTIATE AND DETER THEIR RECORD COMPANY FROM EXERCISING OPTIONS BECAUSE ITS STATUTORILY CONTROLS IMPORTANT FLEXIBLE AND NEGOTIATED CONTRACT PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW PERIODS TO TOUR. OR TO OBTAIN MORE FAVORABLE CONCERT DATA TO DEMONSTRATE SUCCESS GOING FORWARD. THE LAW MAKES VERY PERSONAL BUSINESS DECISIONS LIMITING OPPORTUNITIES AND THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH MEANINGFUL PARTNERSHIPS. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX AS DESTABILIZATION OF RECORDING AGREEMENTS WOULD LEAD TO REDUCED ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO ARTISTS. LESS INVESTMENT IN THE SIGNING DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION OF NEW ACTS. IT WOULD DETER CREATIVE SIX UNDERMINING NON COMMERCIAL GENRES AND ARTISTS SEEKING TO BREAK NEW GROUND. ALL IN FAVOR OF WELL ESTABLISHED WEALTHY ARTISTS WHO ALREADY HAVE LEVERAGE. LABELS LIKE ARTISTS ONE OF THE WELCOMES FLEXIBILITY DIVERSITY INVESTMENT AND RISK IN AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX JEOPARDIZES ALL OF THAT. SO WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX AND ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF PERFORMANCE LEFT. A CHAIR KALRA VICE CHAIR FLUORIDE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MELISSA ATTACK AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION AND OUR MEMBERS DISNEY NBCUNIVERSAL NETFLIX PARAMOUNT SONY PICTURES AND WARNER BROTHERS MPA'S MEMBERS ARE LEADING PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF MOTION PICTURES TELEVISION AND STRIP SERIES. ALL EXHIBIT PLATFORMS THE THEATERS TO BROADCAST AND CABLE TELEVISION INTERNET AND STREAMING SERVICES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST TODAY. IN OUR MEMBER OF OPPOSITION RESPECT OPPOSE AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX FOR SEVERAL REASONS. OUR OUR OBJECTIONS FOCUS ON SUBSECTION II OF THE BILL. FIRST THE BILL WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT EXISTING CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PRODUCERS AND ARTISTS BY VOIDING EXCLUSIVITY TERMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED AND ON WHICH BOTH THE PRODUCERS AND ARTISTS RELY. SECOND THE BILL WILL AT THE END OF THE LONG STANDING PRINCIPLE THEIR EMPLOYEE SHOULD DIRECT THEIR FULL ATTENTION TO ONE EMPLOYER AT A TIME. THIS PRINCIPLE IS BASED IN PART ON THE PRACTICAL REALITY THAT ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT IS MORE LIKELY TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND IMPACT JOB PERFORMANCE AND THE VACANT SUBJECTIVE TERMS SUCH AS DIRECT SCHEDULING CONFLICTAND MATERIALLY INTERFERE WITH THE EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS WILL LEAD TO A FLOOD OF LITIGATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER PARTICULAR. MEET THE OUTPOST IT'S- THIRD EXCLUSIVITY CLAUSES WHICH ARE PART OF INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS ARE EXTENSIVELY NEGOTIATED BETWEEN PRODUCERS AND ARTISTS. BOTH PARTIES BRING THEIR SIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER TO THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND IT IS THROUGH THESE NEGOTIATIONS THAT EACH PARTY BENEFITS THE ARTIST THROUGH GREATER COMPENSATION AND THE PRODUCER FOR SECURING THE ARTIST AVAILABILITY WHICH INSURES THE PROJECT STABILITY. NOT ONLY FOR THE ARTISTS PREFER THE HUNDREDS OF OTHERS EMPLOYED ON A PARTICULAR PROJECT. FOURTH ARTISTS ARE TYPICALLY WELL COMPENSATED FOR PROVIDING THEIR SERVICES ON AN EXCLUSIVE BASIS AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SIX WOULD STRIP AWAY AN ARTIST'S ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FOR HIGHER COMPENSATION IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING THEIR SERVICES EXCLUSIVELY. AND FINALLY AND BY NO MEANS LEAST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THAT THIS BILL UNDERMINES DECADES OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BETWEEN PRODUCERS AND THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT VARIOUS ARTISTS GROUPS IN MOTION PICTURE TELEVISION AND STREAMING PRDUCTION. IN TWENTY TWENTY THIS WAS A TOPIC OF NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE PRODUCERS AND SAG AFTER DURING THEIR NEGOTIATIONS SO I GOT FOR MADE A PROPOSAL THE PRODUCERS RESPONDED AND THEN SAG AFTRA MOVED ON TO OTHER PRIORITIES. AT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE WRITERS GUILD AND THE PRODUCERS THE WRITERS GUILD MADE ADVANCES AND AS A RESULT OF THOSE NICKEL. THE FAT SALARY THRESHOLD FOR EXCLUSIVITY WAS RAISED BY 60% TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER PRODUCTION JOB ON AND THAT'S TO WIN FIFTY THOUSAND IN THE CASE OF CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT OUR PRODUCER COULD NOT HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE SERVICES OF A WRITER ON A TV SERIES. IF THAT WRITER IS PAID LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS DURING THE PRODUCTION PERIOD. AND MORE TO THE POINT WITHOUT REALLY GETTING TIED UP IN THE SPECIFICS THE PARTIES NEGOTIATE THIS ISSUE AND THEY'VE REACHED AGREEMENTS. TO BARGAINING. MINIMUMS AND THRESHOLDS FOR EXCLUSIVITY THIS LAST LEGISLATION YOU SERVICE THAT PROCESS. THE BILL HAS WIDE RANGING IMPACT ACROSS MORE THAN AND THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND WITHIN THE ENTERTAINMENT IS INDUSTRY IT WILL IMPACT MORE THAN JUST SCRIPTED. TV AND STREAMING MOVIE PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE. A NEWS NETWORK WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SECURE THE EXCLUSIVE SERVICES OF A NEWS ANCHOR AND INVEST IN THAT NEWS PROGRAM IN AN EFFORT TO BEAT THE COMPETITION. THE ANCHOR COULD HAVE A CONTRACT WITH ONE NETWORK MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AND BE THE WEEK- ON A COMPETITIVE STATION I SEE THE TIME IS LAPSED LET ME JUST CONCLUDE. I DID PROVIDE YOU WITH MY PREPARED TESTIMONY THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES IN THE PREPARED TESTIMONY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WERE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SCRIPTED SERIES UP FROM TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX IN TWENTY ELEVEN. BOB AND THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE LONGER FOR PRODUCTIONS LIKE UP FEATURE FILMS THIS IS EXPLOSIVE EXPANSION ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAM ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS HAS CREATED NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL THE TALENTED AND CREATIVE PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK IN THIS SECTOR AND IT'S DRIVEN ECONOMIC GROWTH. AB TWENTY NINE TO. PUT ALL OF THIS AT RISK AND WE ASK YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MUCH YOU TO. IN ONE UP TOP IS XIN.

HELLO ADDITIONAL LINES AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HEY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SUBJECTS IN- IN THIS- WELL IN THAT THE LEGISLATURE EXPERIENCE AND CERTAINLY IN THIS COMMITTEE- IT IS BEEN ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING ONES TO REALLY- DIGEST AND- BECOME INFORMED AND- CERTAINLY BOTH OUR- INDUSTRY PARTNERS AND OUR WORKERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA I HAD A REALLY STRONG MENTALITY TO OUR ECONOMY- AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR EVERYBODY BEING OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK- AND WHAT'S FAIRNESS FOR ALL- AS I'VE BEEN COMING AND TAKING SEVERAL MEETINGS- IN BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION UP OF THIS BILL- JUST HAVE SOME THOUGHTS THAT I REALLY WANTED BE ABLE OUT THERE- I KNOW THIS WAS. REALLY THE SUCCESSOR TO AN EFFORT LAST YEAR THAT BEGAN DEVELOPMENT- AND DURING THAT TIME WE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT- AND STILL REMAINS TODAY SEEMS TO BE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE TWO BILLS IN BED AND ONE HERE- SORT OF. THERE THERE'S A TIÞN AND THEIR- A SOME SOME- CAN. TO THESE ISSUES- BUT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE- IMPROVEMENTS FOR SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE TRYING TO TACKLE WITH REGARD TO. THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY HERE. I SEE THOSE AS POTENTIALLY DISTINCT AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE SOLVABLE- TO SOME OF THE ONES THAT WHERE THEY WERE ALSO TRYING TO DEBATE AND SOUL FOR RECORDING ARTIST RECORDING INDUSTRY HERE. SO ALL THE OFTEN THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND THEN MAYBE IF YOU WANNA- SORT OF SUMMARIZES IT AND CLOSE- I DON'T KNOW IF IT THE INTENTION DOWN THE ROAD TO. BIFURCATE THIS BILL AND REALLY TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE BUT IT MIGHT- HELP TO SOLVE ONE AND THEN REALLY FOR THE DEBATE THE OTHER IS THAT THAT MIGHT DESERVE A LITTLE BIT MORE MAYOR. WITHIN THEIR MAYBE MAYBE TURN TENSION TO KEEP THESE COMBINED- FOR- HE FOR MUTUAL SUPPORT. EACH OTHER'S ISSUES- THE ONYX CLUB EXCLUSIVITY ISSUES I AGREE THAT YOU KNOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED AND CERTAINLY MÀ MEDIA HAS CHANGED OPPORTUNITIES AND I'VE CHANGED AND- YOU KNOW FROM FROM BOTH THE THAT. NEED IN THE STREET. ALL THE OPPORTUNE. FOR WORKER TO BE ABLE TO- PUT THEMSELVES FORWARD AND- WE CAPITALIZE ON ON THEIR TALENT ON ON ON WHAT THEY'RE OFFERING OUT THERE. AND THAT SHOULD BE REWARDED- HI- I THINK AS WELL ESPECIALLY AS THINGS ARE FEELING A LITTLE BIT MORE FAST PACED- I TRUST IN THE WORKERS. THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR TIME WELL ENOUGH TO- BE ABLE TO MEET MULTIPLE DEMANDS IF THEY ARE PRESENTING THEMSELVES OUT THERE- WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE. ABLE TO THEIR ORIGINAL AGREEMENTS IF SOMETHING IS STILL INTO A FACT- BUT I WOULD WANT TO DEFER TO. THAT WORKER THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE. PAYMENTS AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN THE ROAD WHERE THEY- ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE SECONDARY EMPLOYER WHILE THEY'RE ON A SIX MONTH BREAK- EXCUSE ME- THERE INVIOLATE. THE PRIME- FOR SOMETHING TO BE WORKED OUT THROUGH. THAT THE SHOULD BE SEEN AS- SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD RESOLVE ITSELF IN FAVOR OF THAT THAT THAT PRIMARY EMPLOYER SOMETHING THAT THE- EMPLOYEE- I WOULD NOT WANT TO PRESENT THEMSELVES. ADDED IN THAT POSITION AND THEN THE- WOULD DO THEMSELVES WELL TO WORK THAT'S ALL WILL WORK THAT OUT- BUT I DON'T WANT TO CONSTRAIN THEIR OPPORTUNITIES IF- IT MEANS THAT IN THE MOMENT THEY CAN. HAVE A LITTLE SIDE WORK HAVE BEEN ON THE SIDE OF OR TO ANY THAT WOULD NOT MATERIALLY CONFLICT. WITH SOME OF THAT PRIMARY WORK AND I'D LIKE TO SEE. I LIKE. THE BILL'S GOING UP ON THE RECORDING INDUSTRY SIDE OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES- YOU KNOW I FUNDAMENTALLY THINK THAT THERE'S- THERE IS A FOLLOW HERE THAT A CONTRACT IS A CONTRACT AND I KNOW THEIR INVESTMENTS MADE EARLIER ON AND I KNOW THE ALSO THE INDIVIDUALS- ME TAKE OFFAND THEY MAY BE VERY WELL- THROUGHOUT THEIR INITIAL EXPERIENCES AND- THEY MAY WANT TO SEE- THE TERMS OF CHANGED THEIR THEIR THE STATUS HAS CHANGED AND- AND- EVEN WITHIN YOU KNOW A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD- THAT ME WARRANT YOU KNOW RENEGOTIATION THAT MAY WARRANT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THEM. SOMETHING THAT. THAT THIS IS WHY HAVING A MORE CHOI WITH IT THOUGH- IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO DELIVER ON FOUR ALBUMS. SINCE DELIVER ON THOSE FOUR ALBUMS- AND BE DONE WITH AND WALK AWAY IF THE RELATIONSHIP IS NOT HEALTHY- JUST EVERY SIDE COMPLETE THEIR WORK I'M STILL HAVING TROUBLE ON THIS SIDE OF THE BILL. FIGURING OUT WHY THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT ZONE OF AGREEMENT HERE- I WOULD LIKE IT TO MOVE FORWARD AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO GO TO THE ARTS COMMITTEE AND THEY'LL BE AT THINKING EVEN DEEPER DISCUSSION ON THE COMMITTEE HAS JURISDICTION IS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE. FOCUSED ON THE SUBJECT AREA OF THIS BILL BUT I JUST LEADERS- TO THE AUTHOR AS KIND OF OBSERVATIONS- AND IN TERMS. OF THE THAT DICEY WITH THIS THAT THAT I HOPE WE'LL ON. MATURE AND- WILL- WILL GET STRESSED OUT. ABOUT THE LICENSE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE ARE- RIGHT SWINGS FOR EVERYBODY HERE THAT THAT WILL MAKE IT A BETTER WORKING ENVIRONMENT FOR- OUR TALENT- BUT ALSO- ONE THAT DOESN'T VIOLATE ANY ISSUES OF FAIRNESS FOR. OUR EMPLOYERS THAT ARE INDUSTRIES HERE IN IN THE STATE THAT THAT WE WANT TO KEEP YOUR ROOM WANT TO KEEP. KEEP HEALTHY AND BE FAIR TO THEM AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SOMEONE WOMAN. REYES THANK YOU MISTER. I WON'T BELABOR THE COMMENTS THAT MIGHT MIGHT DISTINCT COLIC HAS ALREADY SHARED TONIGHT- IT IS IT JUST AS SOON MISTER WARD I TO HAVE TAKEN MANY- MEETING WITH MANY OF THE PROPOSED SITE FROM BOTH SIDES. I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE ALSO IN OUR COLLEAGUE WHO CHAIR CHUCK- KALRA WHO HAS TAKEN ON THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTION THE RIGHT BALANCE. OF WHEN WE HAVE TWO PARTIES- SPEAK ALSO IS AN ATTORNEY MR WARD YOU HAVE TWO SIDES. IF THEY ARE BOTH. NEGOTIATING FROM THE SAME LEVEL THEN IT'S EASY TO SAY IT'S FAIR. TO DO SIGNING YOU'RE DONE BUT WHEN THERE ISN'T THAT YOU'RE NOT NEGOTIATING FROM THE SAME LEVEL THEN THERE IS A PROBLEM THERE AND I THINK SOMETIMES IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO THEN LOOK AT THOSE CONTRACTS. TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS. UNFAIRNESS THEN WE DO NEED TO STEP IN TO HELP PICK IN IT IN IN THAT PROCESS. A CONTRACT IS A CONTRACT AND IF YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY OF RESPONSIBILITY WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CONTRACTS IN THE PAST THAT HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL CONTRACTS. AND I WON'T GO INTO ONE BELIEVER THAT. WE WANT TO SOLUTION TO THIS WITHOUT A DOUBT- THE VERY FIRST COMMENT FROM MY COLLEAGUE WAS HOW IMPORTANT THE INDUSTRY IS. BOTH IN. THE FILM INDUSTRY AND THE RECORDING INDUSTRY SO IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA. AND TO HAVE BOTH PARTIES BE ABLE TO MEET TOGETHER AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS IS GOING TO THE ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT. COMMITTEE AND I KNOW THAT- CHAIR- BOERNER HORVATH IS LOOKING FORWARD. MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT WORD RIGHT. WHAT ALL OF YOU. COME AND SHARED THAT THIS YEAR YOUR SIDES. BUT I THINK THAT THIS BILL ABSOLUTELY DESERVES TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT THE CONVERSATIONS CAN CONTINUE SO THAT THE PARTIES CAN THEN DETERMINE HOW BEST TO THAT PRESENTED. TO THE BODY WHEN WE TAKE TO THE FLOOR. SO WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT AND I. TO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ON THIS I DON'T KNOW THIS BUSINESS MODEL OF JUST. WHETHER IT'S ON THE ON THE- PRODUCTION SIDE OF REDDISH RECORDS OR WHETHER IT'S MOVIES- I KNOW ARE YOU KNOW WHEN I ASKED ABOUT RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. FOR R&amp;D I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE IN OTHER BUSINESS ENTITIES WHEN YOU PUT THAT INVESTMENT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR INVESTMENT BACK- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT IS TO BE GREAT. THE BEST FORMULA FOR STUDIOS AND MUSIC COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK THERE ARE A WIDE TO RETURN ON INVESTMENT. AND BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BANKRUPT DAYS AT IT WILL BE IDIOTS LIKE PUT A GUN TO OUR HEADS IF WE WERE TO TRY TO BANKRUPT IN. INDUSTRY THAT IS NOT ANYTHING ANYBODY UP HERE WANTS TO DO OR ANYBODY IN THE CAPITAL- YOU ARE THRIVING INDUSTRY THAT KEEPS US AFLOAT AND ALIVE. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE TO STINK OUT COMPENSATION AND IN MY- YOU KNOW I. I RETIRED FROM THE CITY OF LA AND SOMEBODY MAKING THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND- IF YOU DO IT CHILDREN SO IT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THAT'S A LOT OF pIN IN MY MIND- AS YOU WERE SAYING THEY GET. WELL COMPENSATED. SO IN IN MY WORLD IN MY MIND IF YOU TALK TO ANY OF. ANY CIVIL SERVANTS IN HIS BUILDING. THEY WOULD. THEY WOULD RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS AT THAT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHERE MY CONFUSION COMES WHEN I ASKED ABOUT- HE TO GET TELEVISION THE TO YOU BUT WHEN ASKED ABOUT CYNTHIA NIXON WHOSE IN DOVER WHAT'S THAT THE GOLDEN AGE AND- AND JUST LIKE THAT SHE'S IN TWO DIFFERENT MAJOR PRODUCTIONS BUT I'M ALSO HEARINGS EXCLUSIVITY THAT WE WANT TO KEEP OUR ONLY IN ONE BOTH THE MAJOR MAJOR- PRODUCTION SO HOW DID SHE GET A DIFFERENT DEAL WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXCLUSIVITY HERE TO CHOOSE THE STUDIO'S REALLY WANT THE SAME WITH- I WANT TO TALK TO RECORDING ENTRY- GET I DON'T SOUND START STARTS ROBERT MAJOR BRIANNA OR THEY MAY TO RE ON AND THE FACT THAT SHE DOES. THE RIGHT MAKE UP AND MOVIES AND THIS AND THAT AND SHE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE COMPLETED ALL OF HER ALBUMS AT THE SAME I BET SHE'S- TO THE RECORDING INDUSTRY SO DOES THAT EXTEND HER TIME- AS FAR AS BEING UNDER CONTRACT AND HOW IS THAT MONEY GETS SPLIT UP I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY DON'T. SHARE IN IT BUT THE RECORDING. FOURTEEN THE ARE SAYING YOU'RE- SO THAT'S WHERE MY- I'M GETTING MIXED INFORMATION I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO BE ACTUALLY DELVE INTO IT TO ACTUALLY GET- WHAT'S REALLY REALLY GOING ON- WITH SWITCH YOUR WITH YOUR CONTRACT IN YOUR WORLD. I REALLY WOULD LIKE FOR THIS TO BE BIFURCATED AND I THINK THE- CHAIRMAN WILL PROBABLY ADDRESS SOME OF THAT- AS WEAK AS YOU MOVE FORWARD- BUT FOR ME. IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT REALLY. WORKS FOR BOTH SIDES. AND WELL WHILE I MAY WANT THIS TO COME GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE IF IT MAKES IT TO THE FLOOR. I MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT. LOOK AT IT BUT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T STOP HERE. AND THAT WE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BUT MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE THIS COMMITTEE AND EVERY MEMBER AT THIS POINT. MEMBER THE NEXT TO ME BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IF IT MAKES IT TO THE FLOOR. THAT EVERY MEMBER REALLY UNDERSTANDS- YOUR BUSINESS MODEL YOU ARE. IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS MODEL. FOR THE AVERAGE AMERICAN THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS PROBABLY DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF MONEY AND BUT YOU TALK ABOUT IN A WAY. WHERE IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AND SO- BUT IF IT WOULD HELP US TO UNDERSTAND- WHY THINGS HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE PAST. AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S A GOOD DIALOGUE WITH THE ARTIST. THE EMPLOYEES WHY IS NOT WORK FOR THEM THE SEVEN YEAR- I DID NOT LEAVE YOU WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME- AND NOT THAT I'M NOT DISCOUNTING THE MOTION PICTURE SIDE OF IT BUT THIS IS THIS IS PROBABLY A AN EXAMPLE OF WHY I'M- I'M I'M NOT TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. WHERE WHAT THE ALBUM IS AN ALBUM THAT ALBUM TO ME THE BUNCH OF RECORDS I GIVE IT TO YOU IT'S AN ALBUM. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT I NEED TO GET THIRTEEN SONGS AND I GIVE YOU TEN BUT THAT DOESN'T COUNT AS AN ALBUM AND YOU TELL ME I STILL OWE YOU AN ALBUM BUT I GAVE YOU TEN SONGS INSTEAD OF THIRTEEN. HOW IS THAT IS THAT NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT WITH HIS WERE ALREADY NEGOTIATING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT WHAT THAT IS- BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF I'VE DONE COLLECTIVE BARGAIN I KNOW WHAT. I KNOW WHAT THAT IS AND I'M A LITTLE MORE PRECISE PRECISE IN MY CALCULATIONS THE DUES NO AMBIGUITY AS WE MOVE FORWARD- AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FURTHER DIALOGUE ON WHAT WHAT AT THE NOW WAS AN ALBUM JUST LIKE ON. THE MOTION PICTURE SIDE. I CAN. CAN YOU HOLD SOMEONE AT AND I JUST AND PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND YOU YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA GET YOUR MOVIE OUT YOU'RE AT A GREASE I USED TO GO TODAY'S BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF MONEY A LOT OF PRODUCTION A LOT OF CUSTOMS A LOT OF RESEARCH IS A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT IN IT. WAS A LOT OF MONEY SO- YOU DON'T WANT YOUR START TRAIPSING OFF GOING SOMEWHERE WHEN YOU GOT ALL THAT MONEY INVESTED IN THERE BUT BUT THEN AGAIN I USED IN THE CITY NIXON EXAMPLE WHERE'S PROBABLY TWO MAJOR PRODUCTIONS THEY'RE DOING STUFF SO I'D LIKE TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IF THIS WERE TO MAKE IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I'M I JUST ASK ON THAT EXCLUSIVITY CLAUSE PART OF IT MAYBE ONE OF THE SUPPORTERS CAN COME UP WITH AN ANSWER BUT- IF YOU ARE- PRODUCING A SERIES. RIGHT N. N. YOU YOU CAST THAT SERIES MAYBE I'LL JUST LOOK AT ME BECAUSE I. WORK FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'RE NOT. A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WORLD BUT- HOW DOES THAT WORK HOW CAN A BUSINESS PLAN FOR THE LIFE OF THE SERIES IF THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR TALENT. MIGHT FIND ANOTHER JOB RIVER MOVING OUT OF IT BACK TO THE CONTRACT SIDE OF THIS THING. CAN YOU HELP WALK US THROUGH THAT IS HOW CAN IT WHETHER IT'S ABC OR WHOEVER RIGHT PLAN FOR A SERIES OF DURATION CAST IT THAT HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE TALENT IS GOING TO STAY THERE. WELL BECAUSE I SIGNED A CONTRACT I WOULD STILL ABSOLUTELY BE TRUE TO MY CONTRACT THAT SHOULD THIS BE SCHEDULED TO SHOOT FROM JANUARY TO MARCH I WOULD BE COMPLETELY AVAILABLE TO YOU. BUT BETWEEN MARCH AND THE FOLLOWING JANUARY. I SHOULD BE A LAUGH WILL TO TAKE A JOB IN WHAT WILL CALL FIRST BECAUSE IT WILD THE WHOLE THING WOULD BE ELIMINATING THE POSITIONS. RIGHT NOW WHEN I SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR A TELEVISION SERIES I GIVE THAT SERIES FIRST POSITION. NOW TECHNICALLY THINGS HAVE BEEN SET UP SO THAT I CAN TAKE A NON COMPETITIVE PROJECT IN SECOND POSITION. THE PROBLEM IS NOBODY WANTS TO TOUCH ME FROM MARCH TO JANUARY. BECAUSE WHAT IF THE NETWORK DECIDES THAT THEY WANT TO PICK US UP AND PUT US IN THE FALL INSTEAD SO I HAVE TO WAIT BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE COMPENSATED FOR THAT WAIT I'M NOT EVEN GONNA BE COMPENSATED FOR THE- YOU KNOW FOR THE- TWELVE EPISODES I DIDN'T SHOOT OF THE SEASON THAT I FIND FOR TWENTY TWO. I KNOW YOU PAY FOR THE TEN THAT I SHOT AND THEN I'M GONNA WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE NETWORK OR THE STUDIO WHOEVER'S IN CHARGE ME DECIDES TO DO WITH MY SHOW. AND THOUGH THERE IS THIS EXCEPTION. THAT IS YOU CAN TAKE SOMETHING IN SECOND POSITION. ALL I CAN SAY IS LIKE OFF THE BOOKS. ALL OF MY FRIENDS THAT NETWORKS AND STUDIOS TELL ME. YEAH BUT ONCE WE HEAR THAT YOU'RE UNDER CONTRACT. WE DON'T WANNA GET INTO IT WE DON'T WANT TO RISK LOSING YOU. WE DON'T WANT YOU TO COME TO WORK IT COST US MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FOR YOU TO BE HONEST SET AND BE TOLD. THEY DECIDED YOU'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO WORK TO REALLY FEEL LIKE THERE'S ALSO. PART OF THIS. THAT IS ABOUT JUST SCHEDULING SCHEDULE LAST GIVE US A TIME FRAME WHERE. YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT A MOVIE FOR SIX MONTHS. YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT- A TELEVISION SERIES AND BE AVAILABLE TEST FROM JANUARY TO MARCH THIS YEAR. AND THEN YOU CAN GO OFF AND DO OTHER WORK WHEN YOU ARE NOT. EXACTLY ON A SET BECAUSE I AM ONLY PAID WHEN I AM PHYSICALLY ON THAT SET AND YES. I AM OWNED. FOR THE REST OF MY TIME FOR THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. YES THANK YOU. YES WILL HAVE TO RESPOND I DON'T ON I'M NOT GOING TO ADDRESS A SPECIFIC SAID BECAUSE- THAT WAS A I UNDERSTAND THE EXAMPLE IN THE SPECIFICS AND- THEN SCHEDULE. WHAT WHAT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE TENDS TO PAINT WITH A BROAD BRUSH. AND I HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION. AS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOARD REFERRED TO THIS AS AS DID ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER. PRODUCTIONS ARE UNIQUE SCHEDULING IS UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE UNIQUE WE DID A SURVEY IN RESPONSE TO LAST YEAR'S BILL. OF OUR MEMBERS WITH SERIES REGULARS. AND WE THE COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY FIFTEEN HUNDRED PERFORMERS ONLY THE PERFORMER SIDE THIS. AGAIN THIS BILL IS BROADER BECAUSE IT'S ALL ARTISTS I CAN. JUST ON THE PERFORMER SIDE. THAT ON. THOSE ARTIST THE PERFORMERS WHO CAME FORWARD WITH REAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES. ON IN 95297% OF THE SITUATIONS THAT WERE PRESENTED TO THE COMPANIES. WERE GRANTED A YES WAIVER AND SET. TO GO OFF AND DO OTHER WORK AND IN THE- BARGAINING CONTRACT IT ALLOWS. FOR SPECIFIC KINDS OF OTHER WORK. ON I DON'T WANT TO DISTURB I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH- IS GOOD WHEN. THAT IT'S IT IS SPECIFIC IT IF YOU'RE IN A SERIES IT COULD BE A FEATURE FILM IT COULD BE A COMMERCIAL COULD BE VOICE OVER WORK. THERE THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. AND THE POINT I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS. ONE SIZE FITS ALL WHICH IS WHAT LEGISLATION TENDS TO BE. IT IS GOING TO BE DISRUPTIVE. WHERE IS IF YOU LEAVE US TO BE BETWEEN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS THE BASELINE. SETS AS A MINIMUM STANDARD AND THRESHOLD. AND THEN THE INDIVIDUALS COME IN WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS. THAT ALLOWS FOR THE ON THE NEW GO TO. NAVIGATION I- OF INDIVIDUAL SERVER. A AND SCHEDULES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. WAS THERE A SECOND THE MOTION. SECOND STILL CHECKING THANK YOU I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YES AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I WOULD SAY THAT UP ON THE EXCUSES EXCLUSIVITY SIDE- THE TRUST THE WORKERS IS CRITICAL AND FOR THE NEED FOR IT TO WORK FOR BOTH SIDES BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT WORKING FOR BOTH SIDES RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL- WE HAVE A UNIT UNILATERAL CHOICE OF THE STUDIO. WITH LITTLE TO NO LEVERAGE AT THE AFTER OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE A VERY BIG NAME YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE LEVERAGE BUT FOR THE FOR THE FOR MOST OF THE WORKING ACTORS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT LEVERAGE AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE GETTING ALL THE POWER OF EXCLUSIVITY TO ONE PARTY. AND THAT'S WHAT THE PART PROBLEM IS IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS LEVELS ON BOTH SIDES AND NOW THEY CAN NEGOTIATE YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO BE EXCLUSIVE LET'S NEGOTIATE EXCLUSIVITY INTO THE CONTRACT WE HAVE TAKEN THAT LEVERAGE COMPLETELY AWAY. FROM THE ARTIST THAT CASE ON THE RECORDING INDUSTRY SIDE LOOK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION TWO EIGHT FIVE FIVE TO SEVEN YEAR STATUTE THAT IS DESIGNED. TO PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING TRAPPED IN LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS BY PROHIBITING THESE CONTRASTS A LASTING NO LONGER THAN SEVEN YEARS THE ONE EXCEPTION IS RECORDING ARTISTS IS ONLY IF IT WAS AN EXCEPTION THAT WAS LOBBIED FOR A IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BY THE INDUSTRY BUT THEY COULDN'T GET. LAWMAKERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY TO EXTEND IT TO UP TO TEN YEARS. AND SO. YOUR ROOM YOU'LL AT THAT. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF I MEAN I'LL- THE SON A MATTER OF IT WE JUST LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF HOLDING ONE TO A CONTRACT LET'S REMEMBER. AS A SUMMER REYES INDICATED THE DIFFERENCE OF NEGOTIATING POWER ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNGER ARTISTS. ANOTHER ORDER INSTANTLY PUT IN A SEVEN YEAR CONTRACT. NOW IT'S ONE THING TO SAY OKAY YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR SIDE OF THE CONTRACT. BUT WHY IS THIS THE ONLY SERVICE CONTRACT WERE ONCE A SEVEN YEARS IS EXPIRED YOU'RE STILL HELD. IN THAT CONTRACT IF YOU HAVE A MONETARY DISPUTE YOU CAN RESOLVE THAT MONETARY DISPUTE. BUT THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM IS OF THESE ARTISTS GET HELD IN THESE CONTRACTS. AND WORK THE WHOLE WE DON'T DO THAT WITH OTHER WORKERS WE DON'T DO THAT. WITH WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT THE ARTIST OF ANY KIND. AND SO THIS IS ABOUT SELF DETERMINATION. THIS IS ABOUT FREEDOM. REALLY WHAT IT COMES UNDER FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHERE DO YOU WORK FOR. IF YOU HAVE A DEAL THAT HE SAID YOU HAVE TO DO A B. AND C. YOU DO A B. AND B. BUT YOU'RE AT THE END OF SEVEN YEARS TO START WORKING OUT. YOU SHOULD THE FREEDOM TO STRIP TO LEAVE AND SICK OF THE WORK AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE. NO IF THEY WANT TO PURSUE OR YOU WANNA TO MUTUALLY AGREE ON WHAT THAT. WHATEVER WAS LEFT OF THE CONTRACT TO DO OVER SHOULD KNOW YOU COULD TRY TO GET YOU GREET YOU GO TO THE COURT THE COURT SYSTEM TO USE FOR THAT. DON'T POINT IT. ALL THE TIME. BUT TO SAY THAT YOU. TO BE. IN CONTRACT OR EXTRA THE CONTRACT CONTINUES TO EXTEND- IT IS JUST NOT JUST. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IT'S A THIS IS A COMPUTER BOTH TWO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES AND TE REASON WHY SOMEONE TO LOOK THESE ARE BOTH OUTDATED. COMPONENTS THAT ARE AFFECTING ARTISTS. AND THEY ARE REALLY CONNECTED TO AN INDUSTRY THAT- THAT ALONG TIME AGO WAS FAR MORE ONEROUS BUT I THINK EVERYONE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. AND HAS IMPROVED IN MANY WAYS BUT WE DO HAVE THESE REMNANTS THAT IT'S UP TO US BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONES THAT THAT CREATED THE ISSUES THAT ARE EXISTING WE HAVE ALSO SOLVED A LOT OF THEM OVER THE DECADES. THERE ARE STILL SOME LEFT TO GO AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OBJECTIVELY SCHOOL OF.
