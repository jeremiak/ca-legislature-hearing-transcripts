PRESENT SENATE BILL FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF THEY WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH MY OFFICE TO FINE TUNE THIS LEGISLATION AND ADDRESS CONCERNS AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS PRESENTED BY THE COMMITTEE. MODELED AFTER THE SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACT PASSED BY CONGRESS AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT CLINTON IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX. SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN ALLOWS FOR REGULATORY RELIEF BY REQUIRING STATE AGENCIES TO ESTABLISH POLICIES TO PROVIDE FOR THE REDUCTION OR WAIVER. OF CIVIL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF REGULATORY OR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS BY A SMALL BUSINESS. THIS BILL DOES NOT LESSEN REGULATORY STANDARDS ON SMALL BUSINESSES OR REDUCE THE RULEMAKING AUTHORITY OF THE STATE AGENCIES. INSTEAD IT SIX TO IMPLEMENT AN ADDITIONAL REVIEW OF CIVIL PENALTIES IMPOSED ON SMALL BUSINESS TO PER TO PREVENT PENALTIES FOR MINOR INFRACTIONS LEADING TO FINANCIAL RUIN IN THE EVENTUAL BANKRUPTCY OF A SMALL BUSINESS. TO PREVENT BAD ACTORS FROM BENEFITING FROM SUCH A POLICY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRED TO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA TO QUALIFY FOR A PENALTY REDUCTION. THE VIOLATION MUST NOT INVOLVE WILLFUL OR CRIMINAL CONDUCT. IN THE VIOLATION SHOULD NOT POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT. SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN ALSO PROVIDES FACTORS FOR STATE AGENCIES TO CONSIDER IF AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE PENALTY SHOULD BE REDUCED WHICH INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH SMALL BUSINESSES COOPERATED DURING ANY DESTINATION. THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE SMALL BUSINESS ENGAGE IN SUBSEQUENT ACTION TO CORRECT THE VIOLATION. PRIOR HISTORY OF pREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THE DEGREE TO WHICH A PENALTY WOULD IMPEDE THE SMALL BUSINESS FROM CONTINUING TO OPERATE. IN THE DEGREE TO WHICH SMALL BUSINESS ACTIONS WERE NEGLIGENT. WITH THE AMENDMENTS THE STATE AGENCY MAY ALSO APPLY CONDITIONS TO THE REDUCTION OR WAIVER OF PENALTIES. INCLUDING REQUIRING THE SMALL BUSINESS TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION OR ATTEND TO SPECIFY TRAINING. MANY HAVE SEEN THAT RECENT EVENTS HAVE PROVEN SMALL BUSINESSES ARE INDISPENSABLE PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AS AN INTERVAL SHARE OF CALIFORNIA'S THREE TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE A DRIVING FORCE IN JOB CREATION AND TAX REVENUE. AS NOTE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SMALL BUSINESSES WITH LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES MAKE UP 97% OF ALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE EMPLOYEE ALMOST 35% OF THE FORCE. AND THOSE WITH LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES HAVE THE STRONGEST NET JOB GROWTH. THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S BUSINESS COUNCIL PUBLISHER ANALYSIS OF WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES. THERE WERE ONE POINT THREE MILLION WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA INCREASE OF 27% FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN OF THESE BUSINESSES 90% HAD. NO EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN THE OWNER. MINORITY WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA ALSO SAW THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF GROWTH WITH OVER 78% AMONG HISPANIC WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES 57% AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES AND 44% AMONG ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES. DURING THE PANDEMIC BUSINESS AND WORKERS HAVE STEPPED UP TO CONTINUE PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ESSENTIAL SERVICES SUPPLIES AND FOOD NOW MORE THAN EVER CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION TO PROVIDE REGULATORY FINANCIAL RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES THERE ARE A VITAL PART OF OUR ECONOMY. SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WILL FURTHER ASSIST CALIFORNIANS DURING AN ALREADY TRYING ON CERTAIN TIME.

AND SEEING NO ONE I BELIEVE NOW IT'S TIME FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION FOR APPROVAL. MOVED BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOICE SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK SILVA- I HAD I HAD A COMMON PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT- UP FIRST OF ALL. AS OR IN A PANDEMIC IN NOTHING NORMAL BUT WE NEED TO RESPOND TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY OCCURRING AND FROM THE NOTES HERE WE KNOW THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE INDEED BEEN AND ACTED AND ONE. CAT THE- SMALL BUSINESSES BUT DIFFICULT WE MIND OUR OWN SMALL BUSINESSES WOMEN VETERANS THESE BUSINESSES ARE EVEN HIT HARDER. I SUPPORT THIS BILL. AS WE KNOW THAT FOR MANY OF US WHEN. THERE IS SOMETHING BROKEN WE WANT TO FIX IT LIKE WE GET IF THE TICKET- ON OUR CARS. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I SUPPORT YOU JUST MISS BEHAVIOR OR SAFE. WORK ARE SET FORTH BUT SOME OF THE NOTES RIGHT THERE'S A 70% OF BUSINESSES ARE NOW DELAYING PURCHASES SO AGAIN LOOKING. OUR BENEFITS AND- PLACE EVER BUSINESS CLOSED IS GONNA IMPACT SOMEONE. 50% OF WORKERS AT SMALL BUSINESSES WITH LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR JOBS RIGHT NOW 4% OF THE VULNERABLE SMALL BUSINESSES JOBS FALL WITH TWO OCCUPATIONS FOOD SERVICE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE I LIVE IN FULLER TO JUST DAY ON TAP. UP THE SLOPE. SAUCE TEAM IN SMALL BUSINESSES. LIST NOT JUST IN THE LAST WEEKS SO I DO SUPPORT SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE IT FORWARD. FOR SURE I HAVE A QUESTION THANK YOU I BELIEVE- DOCTOR CHOI WAS NEXT FALL BUT THEN AS PER OUR ABOUT FIVE AND TRUMP'S. SENATOR WOULD YOUR SIDE THANK YOU. THE BILL- WHICH TRIES TO HELP A SMALL BUSINESSES AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER THIS IS ONE OF MY STRONG INTERESTS AREA- AMONG AS MANY AT THE- OF SHE IS SOMEONE A WOMAN THAT BODY. WAS SO CONCERNED WAS THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES FOR MANY TIMES A HARASSED BY INTENTIONAL. THE GATORS ALONG WITH THE ATTORNEYS SO MADE UP OF. FOR INDICATING A D. A. IN COMPLIANCE. AND THE SELLERS THE BEAT THE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO WE'RE GOING. AND WITHOUT GIVING ANY CHANCE TO FIX IT. SO I WONDER WHETHER THIS BILL. WILL COVER THAT KIND OF A PRACTICES. THANK YOU THE CHAIR IF I MAY. I THANK YOU- ASSEMBLYMAN YOU YOU BRING UP A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT THE AND I SAY THIS AS AN ATTORNEY AND A FORMER LAW PROFESSOR I'M FAIRLY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH- THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN HOW. SOME FOLKS HAVE USED THE LAW TO LARGELY AFFECT SOCIAL CHANGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY. I AS CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS NOT ALL BUT CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS HAVE FOUND A SLIGHT OR INADVERTENT MISTAKES AND EXPLOITED THOSE TO THE POINT WHERE A SMALL MOM AND POP FIRST GENERATION BUSINESS GOES UNDER. UNLESS THEY PAID THE ARE LISTED AT RISK REQUESTED AMOUNT. I THINK WHAT THIS DOES AND I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT. IT'S CLEAR I THINK WE HAD A COUPLE OF COMMENTS FROM FOLKS THAT HAD CONCERNS- ELSER WITH ONE OF THEM- IN THIS I'M DRAWING FROM THE LETTER. IT IT IS CRITICAL OF THIS BECAUSE- IT WOULD. ALLOW FOLKS TO EVADE THE CONSEQUENCES OF NEGLIGENT OR RECKLESS CONDUCT. LET ME BE FIRST TO SAY THAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS NOW INCLUDES NEGLIGENCE NEGLIGENCE AS A CONSIDERATION. OR VIOLATIONS OPPOSED TO HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT. SO TO THE BILL ITSELF SAYS THAT IN ORDER TO BE EVEN CONSIDERED FOR DISCRETIONARY REVIEW OF THE MATTER THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WILLFUL. ARE OR HAVE A CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT. AND IT SHOULD NOT HAVE POSED A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT. SHE SOME OF THE FOLKS. ARE PROVIDE THESE LETTERS WHETHER THEY'RE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION BUT I THINK THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A SITUATION HERE WHERE MAYBE THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO. APPRECIATE THE FULL BREADTH OF WHAT WAS EXPLAINED TO GETTING TO YOUR TO YOUR POINT. WE ARE NOT TAKING WAIT A FORTY. FROM ANY STATE AGENCY. I'LL BE VERY CLEAR NOT TAKING AWAY AUTHORITY FROM ANY STATE AGENCY IN FACT WE'RE GIVING THEM. AUTHORITY IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO BOB EVALUATE ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A GIVEN MATTER. THAT'S THAT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE AS IT IS THE DEPARTMENT. WE'RE JUST ALLOWING THEM TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT IF THEY WISH TO LOOK AT MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT THEY CAN'T TALK TO THEM NOT UP TO YOU TO ME IT'S NOT THIS PIECE LEGISLATION SO YOUR BILL WOULD NOT HAVE ANY ENFORCING POWER ON THE SUGGESTION NOT AT ALL AND SO YOUR QUESTION IS WHETHER NOT THIS COULD HELP IN THE SITUATION WHERE SMALL BUSINESS. SAMPLE THE- UP IN. FOR THE ELECTRICAL ON. A PORSCHE OF THE RESTAURANT AND- OR WHETHER THE- WHETHER THE HEIGHT OF THE DOOR WAS AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. THIS IS DESIGNED FOR THAT RELEVANT DEPARTMENT TO EVALUATE WHETHER THAT. FIRST GENERATION IMMIGRANT MOM AND POP RESTAURANT SHOULD GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE- OF THE- OUR CIRCUMSTANCE BUT BETTER YET IT HELPS THEM. READ A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN REMEDY THE PROBLEM WE WANT THEM TO STAY IN BUSINESS WE DO GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT IT IF THEY DON'T WELL THEN SHAME ON THAT THEN THEY DESERVE POSITION ALL THESE THAT ARE ALLOWED LAW. THIS HELPS. HELP SERVICE PLEASE HELP THIRD HELPS OUR COMMUNITIES. OUR SHE'LL BE ABLE WAS A LITTLE BIT STRONGER IN THAT THAT DIRECTION BUT THEN ANYWAY I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BEGINNING AND- TO BE CONSIDERED. THANK YOU ARE AT THE MOBILE- UNDERSTANDING OF ON OUR LIFE GO WILL FORWARD VIOLATION HIDE OFFICES. ALL TABLE WHEN BECAUSE SMALL PORCHES WHEN THE SOMEBODY BUT THAT BUSINESS. CREATION OF ADA COMPLIANCE AND THIS SECOND QUESTION THAT'S A RELATED IS THAT. ADA AS I STAND THAT'S MORE OF A FEDERAL STATUTE SO WHETHER. OUR FEDERAL AGENCY NOT STATE AGENCY ORDER BE AFFECTED BY THIS APPEAL SO THAT'LL BE ANOTHER QUESTION. THAT LAST PART SIR EIGHTY A OUR REGULATIONS ARE MORE OF A FEDERAL REGULATIONS WE HAVE MY MEASURES THAT WE HAVE STATE COUNTERPART REGULATIONS ON THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT WAS AT THE FAT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT I BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT IS LONG AS WE LOOK UPON THIS AS- THE STATE OF CAL HAS IN. AMOUNT OF PART. AND REGULATORY BODIES WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SAYS WE'D LIKE YOU AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THIS BUT MAYBE AT SOME POINT WE WILL WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR THE CONDITIONS AND IF WAY THAT YOU CAN. ARM AS AWARE A CIRCUMSTANCE CAN BE REVIEWED FOR MITIGATING OUR PURPOSES MAKING CERTAIN THAT IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE HEALTH SAFETY OR THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT WAS NOT WILLFUL OVERTLY BUDGET THEN YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT DISCRETION. ONE OF. EASIER FOR THIS LABOR DEPARTMENT TO IDENTIFY THAT THEY HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE THAT WILL SATISFY- A DISCRETIONARY MEAT. SO THEY THEY MAY VERY WELL NOT HAVE TO DO TOO MUCH OF REPORT- AT ALL BUT THE BOARD CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT BEAR ON SMALL BUSINESS I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. ALL OF THEM AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. DEVISE A PLAN THAT WOULD EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT DEPARTMENT HEADS SHOULD BEAR ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES. I LIKE YOUR BILL IT IF THERE'S ANY ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL CO AUTHORS ARE CAN YOU ACCEPT MISS CLOUT BELLAMY THIS IS FIVE. WE RECEIVED THIRTY NINE OUT OF FORTY WHAT'S HAVING ONE WAS ABSENT IN THE SENATE THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL. BECAUSE I THINK EVERYONE OR STAY THAT DO DURING IT HIGHLY THE NEED. FOR US TO HAVE BALANCED. APPROACH TO HELPING OUR COMMUNITIES HELPING OUR BUSINESSES YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THE FIRST GENERATION OR WHETHER THEY'RE THEY'RE- PHONE OR WHETHER THEY'RE A- OTHER TYPES OF A ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT START UPS. AND WE NEED TO PUT OUR ARMS AROUND- THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY BECAUSE WE ARE. GOING TO BE HURTING IF WE DON'T TAKE STRONG I. PROGRESSIVE STEPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS- SO WHO ESTABLISHES THAT THE ACTION WAS NOT WILLFUL NEGLIGENT ARE HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT WE HAD OPPONENTS TO FIVE. IT COULD BE IN THAT KIND OF DETERMINE THE BEST A THAT'S A FANTASTIC QUESTION THE BEAUTY OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION IS THAT IT IS GIVING THE AUTHORITY TO THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENT. AT THAT DEPARTMENT WHETHER IT BE A DEPARTMENT HEAD OR WHETHER BE A TEAM- WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF AS THEY PUT FORWARD THEIR OWN AND- THAT WILL ALLOW FOR A REVIEW. BY MATT IT'S GONNA BE A TO THE- TO THE TRUCK. HE THE APPROPRIATE TO SIT MAKING OUR UP. FOR OUR POSITION. AND IS THERE A CATEGORY OF PENALTIES THAT CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE DISCRETION THE UP OPPONENTS PER OUT THAT A LOT OF- PENALTIES HAVE DISCRETION TO BE ZERO IF FOR EXAMPLE THAT EXIT GET SOMEBODY WENT OUT- I WANT TO REFER. THAT OVER YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS COMP THAT NOT BEING THERE ARE NOT HAVING PAID JOBS THOSE ARE THOSE ARE NOT WE FELL NOT GEN BUT I'VE WOULD HAVE EFFECT ON SOME OF THE FILE TV RIGHT NOW. I'M OR IS THAT YOU WERE PUT LTTLE AT WITH NO CURRENT AND LAW. DESIGN AND DEPARTMENTS TO THEIR OWN OWN POLICY AND. FOR EXAMPLE USE THE BOND I'M GONNA CALL RECORD LABOR IF THE LATE DIVISION REALIZES IT STATUTORY WORDING GIVE SOME DISCRETION WITHIN THAT RESOLVES THAT IN THE INSTANCES OF IT MEANT THAT MEET HE DOESN'T HAVE STATUTORY REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO USE ITS DISCRETION THE MAP WHEN I IS WHEN I THINK IT WOULD BE ACTIVATED THIRTY WHAT'S THAT. RUN THROUGH. THE FORMULA HE WILL SET SOME. SO I GUESS LAST YEAR AROUND A BILL- ON AND- THAT REALLY LOOKED AT SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES I'VE HAD TWO SMALL BUSINESSES SO I'M ONE OF THOSE MOM POP SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURES OF CALIFORNIA. LABOR CODES- AS THEY APPLY SMALL BUSINESSES. GUESS WHERE I STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL IS. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC. OUR BUSINESSES NEED HELP NOW YOU AND YOUR BILL USE OF TAXPAYER MONEY NOW FOR SOMETHING DOWN THE ROAD THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE NECESSARY WE DON'T KNOW THE CATEGORY OF. OUR AGENCIES THEY HAVE DISCRETION. AND I KIND OF THINK AS AS AND SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW IN MY MIND THE WORLD IS ON FIRE AND WE NEED TO BE YOURSELF NOW. AND IT CHALLENGING TO SUPPORT A POLICY. THAT USES MY DIVERTS MONEY FROM SMALL BUSINESSES NOW TO THIS OTHER THING ON THE ROAD. I CAN'T THINK WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. REALLY EDUCATING OUR SMALL THE SPECIAL MICHAEL BUSINESSES I THINK THE OF THE TWENTY N. UNDERS ARE THE ONES I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT. A CITY. YEAH I KNOW WE'VE DONE SEVERAL. I'M NOT WE DO I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL AT AND BETTER OF TAX MONEY SO I GONNA PUT STAY OFF TODAY BUT APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS IN AND ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. HE IF I MAY. THE CHECK YOU BRING SME VERY IMPORTANT POINTS- THE ORIGINAL DRAFTING OF THIS WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE SENATE I HAD AN APPROPRIATION. AND IN CONSULTATION WITH THE WITH WITH LEADERSHIP AND BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE MOST OBVIOUS. WE REALIZE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ON IN A FINANCIAL POSITION RIGHT NOW. BUT I THINK WHAT'S WAIT WHILE WE CAN DISSIPATE THE RECOVERY IS WHAT TAKE A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME. SO THIS BILL DOES THAT. DOES NOT ACTUALLY HAVE AN APPROPRIATION ATTACHED TO IT. IT IS DESIGNED IN ITS IN ITS FORM NOW THERE IS NO PREPARATION ATTACHED TO THIS THIS IS THE FRAMEWORK. AND AS- THINGS MOVE FORWARD- I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL I DO DEEPER DIVES AND WE'RE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES CAN EXIST IN THE FUTURE- AND THEN. CREATE THESE- CREATE THESE DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT- SELF REVIEWS AND SELF PROPOSALS- BUT TO YOUR POINT. YEP WE'RE ON FIRE RIGHT NOW I AGREE AND- WE HAVE TO IN THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE TO INVEST IN OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. TOMORROW YESTERDAY. I THIS IS I THINK ONE OF PART OF A LARGER. OF POLITICAL DIRECT IN THAT WE GO HEALTH. I NOT GOING TO OF EVERY. WE SEE IT NOW BUT IT WILL BE HELPFUL DOWN ROAD THAT'S MY BELIEF. MR RAHMAN THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU- SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS SOME TIME THE BILL TO CHART TENSION- CERTAINLY SMALL BUSINESSES NASCO THAT THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE SUCH AS FAR SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESS. WHO ARE ASKED. A LOT DURING THE NINETEEN PARA ONE SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE TO PUT OF PETITIONS- OPEN UP AND THEN BE TOLD NO THEY CAN ONLY SERVE OUTSIDE. SO THERE IS SOME SOME NEED FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THEM ARE TOO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW. IN THIS BILL- STARTS TO ADDRESS THAT DOES NOT AND STUFF ALL IS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE FACING BUT STARTS TO OPEN UP THAT DIALOGUE THAT DISCUSSION. MILLER TO WHAT'S HAPPENED AROUND THIS DAY THIS SO SMALL BUSINESSES NEED TO BE THE BACKBONE OF. ME IN LOT ELECTION. AND DURING THE CALL THE NIGHT ERA. BE ABLE TO LOOK AT. SOME PROTECTIONS FOR BUSINESS WHERE AT IN THEM. ONE GEN REVENUE WOULD HELP THE LOCAL JURIST. RIGHT DURING THE BRING MONEY INTO THE GENERAL FUND OR AT THEM TO DO A LOT BUT THIS START NOW OKAY. FOR SAYS. BUSINESS IS THERE ARE THERE ARE ENGAGE WILLFULLY IN A LAWFUL MANNER NOT BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT ENGAGE IT WILL FOR MANNER WITH REGULATIONS THAT ARE THERE.

A AND I BE SUPPORTING BILL. YOU. OF COURSE SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE'RE SEEING THE IMPORTANCE OF THAN LIKE WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE DUE TO.
