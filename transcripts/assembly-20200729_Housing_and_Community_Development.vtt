RABBI- IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND

02:32:44.221 --> 02:32:46.457

MY KIDS GO TO SCHOOL AND IT'S A

02:32:50.928 --> 02:32:53.797
PLACE THAT IT IS REALLY

02:32:53.864 --> 02:32:54.965
IMPORTANT TO MY FAMILY ME. AND

02:32:55.032 --> 02:32:55.900
OUR COMMUNITY. LIKE MANY OTHER

02:32:55.966 --> 02:32:57.101
FAITH COMMUNITIES IN THE WEST

02:32:57.167 --> 02:32:58.235
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY ACROSS THE

02:32:58.302 --> 02:32:59.570
STATE. HAS TALKED IN RECENT

02:32:59.637 --> 02:33:01.705
YEARS ABOUT HOW WE CAN. HELP TO

02:33:01.772 --> 02:33:02.973
ADDRESS OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:04.642
WE'VE SEEN. A BIG INCREASE IN

02:33:04.708 --> 02:33:05.643
THE WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY

02:33:05.709 --> 02:33:07.511
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:08.812
AND THEIR FAITH COMMUNITIES OF

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:10.247
EVERY DENOMINATION THAT WANT TO

02:33:10.314 --> 02:33:11.549
LIVE OUT THEIR VALUES. NEVER

02:33:11.615 --> 02:33:12.683
WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION

02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:14.051
HERE. THEY WANT TO HELP OUR

02:33:14.118 --> 02:33:16.153
HOMELESS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.

02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:16.887
AND SO ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT

02:33:16.954 --> 02:33:18.522
WAS PROPOSED. WAS BUILDING

02:33:18.589 --> 02:33:20.057
SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ABOVE

02:33:20.124 --> 02:33:21.625
OUR PARKING LOT. AS A WAY TO

02:33:21.692 --> 02:33:23.360
HELP FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:33:23.427 --> 02:33:24.929
AND SO THE RABBI TALKS ABOUT

02:33:24.995 --> 02:33:26.330
HIS VISION FOR BUILDING NOT.

02:33:26.397 --> 02:33:28.432
ABOUT HOW WOULD ALLOW- KIDS

02:33:28.499 --> 02:33:29.900
LIKE MINE. WHO ARE AT THE

02:33:29.967 --> 02:33:31.068
PRESCHOOL THERE TO INTERACT

02:33:31.135 --> 02:33:31.535
WITH FOLKS OF AN OLDER

02:33:31.602 --> 02:33:32.870
GENERATION TO HELP KEEP.

02:33:32.937 --> 02:33:34.505
SENIORS OFF THE STREETS WE SAW

02:33:34.572 --> 02:33:35.739
IN THE MOST RECENT HOMES COUNT

02:33:35.806 --> 02:33:37.308
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT.

02:33:37.374 --> 02:33:39.176
FOLKS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO

02:33:39.243 --> 02:33:40.377
ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK FROM

02:33:40.444 --> 02:33:42.046
HOMELESSNESS. SO THIS IS THE

02:33:42.112 --> 02:33:43.213
KIND OF THING THAT I THINK CAN

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:44.715
REALLY BRING. BENEFITS TO OUR

02:33:44.782 --> 02:33:46.183

FAITH COMMUNITIES TO DO WHAT

02:33:47.651 --> 02:33:48.586
THEY VIEW AS AN ESSENTIAL PART.

02:33:48.652 --> 02:33:49.987
OF THEIR MISSION AND THEIR

02:33:50.054 --> 02:33:52.222
WORK. AND I WILL JUST NOTE FOR

02:33:52.289 --> 02:33:53.057
SOME OF THE CALLERS TO MENTION

02:33:53.123 --> 02:33:54.525
THAT. YOU KNOW FOLKS IN

02:33:54.592 --> 02:33:55.426
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OPPOSED TO

02:33:55.492 --> 02:33:57.094
THOSE FOLKS WHO LIVE NEAR THESE

02:33:57.161 --> 02:33:57.695
ARE OPPOSED TO THIS ACTION TO

02:33:57.761 --> 02:34:00.030

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:16.680
TO SEE WHAT THEIR REACTIONS

02:34:16.747 --> 02:34:18.215
MIGHT BE. AND THEY WERE SO

02:34:18.282 --> 02:34:19.617
ENTHUSIASTIC. THEY THEY THOUGHT

02:34:19.683 --> 02:34:20.551
THAT THIS WAS BE A BEAUTIFUL

02:34:20.618 --> 02:34:21.952

MAJORITY OPINION IN. HIS

02:34:35.532 --> 02:34:36.767

SIMPLY. RESOLVES A SITUATION

03:05:00.789 --> 03:05:02.691
THAT IS BOTH ANOMALOUS AND

03:05:02.758 --> 03:05:04.827
INEQUITABLE AS IT RELATES TO

03:05:04.893 --> 03:05:07.663
MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS SO

03:05:07.729 --> 03:05:09.298
LET ME ILLUSTRATE HOW THIS.

03:05:09.364 --> 03:05:11.300
WORKS RIGHT NOW UNDER EXISTING

03:05:11.366 --> 03:05:14.436

03:05:14.503 --> 03:05:17.272
UNITS YOU'VE GOT A MOBILE HOME.

03:05:17.339 --> 03:05:19.074
IN A HUNDRED METERS AWAY OF A

03:05:19.141 --> 03:05:21.143
TWO MILLION DOLLAR HOUSE. IF

03:05:21.210 --> 03:05:22.511
THERE'S A LOCAL RENT CONTROL

03:05:22.578 --> 03:05:25.380
ORDINANCE AND THE MOBILE HOME

03:05:25.447 --> 03:05:28.417
OWNER HAS A LEASE MORE THAN

03:05:28.484 --> 03:05:28.984
TWELVE MONTHS WHICH IS QUITE

03:05:29.051 --> 03:05:30.519
COMMON. AND THERE'S A RENT

03:05:30.586 --> 03:05:32.287
CONTROL AN INSTANCE IN AFFECTED

03:05:32.354 --> 03:05:33.856
THAT LOCALITY. THE TWO MILLION

03:05:33.922 --> 03:05:38.827
DOLLAR. HOME TENANT. CAN AVAIL

03:05:38.894 --> 03:05:39.361
HIMSELF OR HERSELF OF THE

03:05:39.428 --> 03:05:41.630
PROTECTIONS OF THE LOCAL RENT

03:05:41.697 --> 03:05:43.966
CONTROL ORDINANCE WHERE IS THE

03:05:44.032 --> 03:05:46.001
PERSON LIVES IN THE SENIOR PARK

03:05:46.068 --> 03:05:47.903
A HUNDRED METERS AWAY HAS NO

03:05:47.970 --> 03:05:50.305
SUCH PROTECTIONS. AND THIS IS

03:05:50.372 --> 03:05:52.574
THE RESULT. OF WHAT WHAT I

03:05:52.641 --> 03:05:54.543
WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS AN

03:05:54.610 --> 03:05:57.045
ANOMALY IN THE LAW. THAT SAYS

03:05:57.112 --> 03:05:58.814
THAT IF YOU ARE IN A MOBILE

03:05:58.881 --> 03:06:01.216
HOME PARK AND YOU HAVE A LEAST

03:06:01.283 --> 03:06:03.919
ONE IN TWELVE MONTHS. YOU CAN'T

03:06:03.986 --> 03:06:04.419
AVAIL YOURSELF OF THE

03:06:04.486 --> 03:06:05.621
PROTECTIONS OF ANY RENT

03:06:05.687 --> 03:06:06.822
STABILIZATION A RENT CONTROL

03:06:06.889 --> 03:06:10.359
ORDINANCE. IN THE AREA. AND SO

03:06:10.425 --> 03:06:11.960
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SIMPLY

03:06:12.027 --> 03:06:16.265
SAYS LOOK AT. ARE THE LAW WILL

03:06:16.331 --> 03:06:18.000
BE APPLIED EQUALLY. IT MEANS

03:06:18.066 --> 03:06:22.337
THAT THE LOCALITY THEN CONTROLS

03:06:22.404 --> 03:06:23.805
WHETHER OR NOT GOING TO BE RENT

03:06:23.872 --> 03:06:26.675
STABILIZATION FOR CONTROL. NOT

03:06:26.742 --> 03:06:29.478
IMPOSE STATEWIDE RENT CONTROL

03:06:29.545 --> 03:06:31.547
ARM AND THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE

03:06:31.613 --> 03:06:34.550
IS THE BENEFITS OF THAT BUT

03:06:34.616 --> 03:06:36.885
WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT RETURNS

03:06:36.952 --> 03:06:38.954
TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THE

03:06:39.021 --> 03:06:40.489
ABILITY TO MAKE THAT

03:06:40.556 --> 03:06:43.358
DETERMINATION. NOW WHILE THE

03:06:43.425 --> 03:06:45.093
OPPONENTS ARE GONNA TESTIFY

03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:47.029
THAT THIS BILL SOMEHOW.

03:06:47.095 --> 03:06:49.164
ELIMINATES LONG TERM LEASES

03:06:49.231 --> 03:06:50.165
THEN I WOULD INVITE THE

03:06:50.232 --> 03:06:52.100
COMMITTEE TO ASK THE QUESTION

03:06:52.167 --> 03:06:53.535
WHERE IN THE BILL DOES IT.

03:06:53.602 --> 03:06:56.572
ELIMINATE TERM LEASES IT DOES

03:06:56.638 --> 03:06:58.640
NOT IN IN FACT IF THERE'S AN

03:06:58.707 --> 03:06:59.908
ISSUE IF THERE IS A CONCERN IF

03:06:59.975 --> 03:07:01.810
THERE IS ABOUT WILL BE HAPPY TO

03:07:01.877 --> 03:07:03.178
AMEND THE BILL TO MAKE SURE

03:07:03.245 --> 03:07:05.681
THAT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE LONG

03:07:05.747 --> 03:07:07.983
TERM LEASES. NOW WHAT IT DOES

03:07:08.050 --> 03:07:13.789
DO IS THAT. IF THERE IS A LONG

03:07:13.855 --> 03:07:14.356
TERM LEASE. AND RENT CONTROL

03:07:14.423 --> 03:07:15.691
COMES IN BEING IN THAT LOCALITY.

03:07:15.757 --> 03:07:17.559
THEN THEY CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES

03:07:17.626 --> 03:07:19.528
OF THAT PROTECTION IT ALSO

03:07:19.595 --> 03:07:22.064
GRANDFATHERS IN LONG TERM

03:07:22.130 --> 03:07:25.701

PURPOSE OF THE DENSITY BONUS

03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:51.786

PROJECT DUE TO THE DENSITY

03:24:19.580 --> 03:24:21.882
BONUS. IT'S SORT OF TECHNICALLY

03:24:21.949 --> 03:24:24.619
DOUBLE DIPPING. AND SO WHAT CAN

03:24:24.685 --> 03:24:27.054
EIGHTY FIVE DOES IS HELP US GET

03:24:27.121 --> 03:24:29.924
IN CONFORMITY WITH A COURT

03:24:29.991 --> 03:24:30.891
RULING TO LEARN A COURT

03:24:30.958 --> 03:24:33.027
DECISION WHICH BASICALLY SAID

THAT. THE LOCAL ORDINANCES USE

03:24:36.097 --> 03:24:40.501
OF THAT FEE ON THOSE TWO UNITS

03:24:40.568 --> 03:24:42.269
WAS COUNTRY AND THERE ARE

03:24:42.336 --> 03:24:43.504
TURNING GENERAL'S RECENT

03:24:43.571 --> 03:24:45.573
OPINION WHICH IS CITED IN THE

ANALYSIS THAT EXPRESS THAT.

03:24:48.542 --> 03:24:50.878
IMPOSING FEES ON UNITS IS

03:24:50.945 --> 03:24:53.247
CONTRADICTORY TO STATE LAW SO

03:24:53.314 --> 03:24:55.783
IT THIS SO I JUST WANNA BE

03:24:55.850 --> 03:24:58.085
SOME CONFUSION THAT THE BILL

03:24:58.152 --> 03:25:00.855
DOES NOT ELIMINATE FEES LIKE IF

03:25:00.921 --> 03:25:03.524
THERE'S A STRUCTURE FEES OR

03:25:03.591 --> 03:25:04.859
OTHER TYPES OF THE SCHOOL FEES.

03:25:04.925 --> 03:25:07.395
FEES IN THOSE THINGS IT DOES

03:25:07.461 --> 03:25:09.930
NOT TOUCH THOSE AND IT ONLY

03:25:09.997 --> 03:25:14.101

CONFUSION SO I JUST WANT TO

03:25:20.307 --> 03:25:21.475
RAISE THAT. THERE'S A FEW

03:25:21.542 --> 03:25:23.010
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE RAISED

03:25:23.077 --> 03:25:25.946
THE ISSUE NOT- ARMED MEN BUT

THIS BILL- IN PARTICULAR ONE

03:43:57.257 --> 03:43:58.925
JUST HIGHLIGHT- THERE WERE

03:43:58.992 --> 03:44:01.361
PROVISIONS AROUND HOW WE

03:44:01.427 --> 03:44:02.162
ENCOURAGE MODERATE INCOME

03:44:02.228 --> 03:44:03.663
HOUSING AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

03:44:03.730 --> 03:44:05.765
I DO THINK. THE STATE SHOULD

03:44:05.832 --> 03:44:06.332
HAVE A ROLE IN ENCOURAGING

03:44:06.399 --> 03:44:08.334
MODERATE INCOME HOUSING BUT I

03:44:08.401 --> 03:44:10.570
ALSO THINK THAT THERE WAS.

03:44:10.637 --> 03:44:12.338
DEFINITELY A LOT WE NEEDED TO

03:44:12.405 --> 03:44:13.673
THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS IN A

03:44:13.740 --> 03:44:15.575
WAY THAT DOESN'T UNDERMINE OR

03:44:15.642 --> 03:44:17.010
DISINCENTIVE THE CONSTRUCTION

03:44:17.076 --> 03:44:18.478

03:44:18.545 --> 03:44:20.513
