SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MEMBERS. ARRESTERS INDUSTRY FOR NINETEEN I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS I'M HAVING WITH THE NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES OVER THE PAST- WEEKS IN LEADING UP TO THIS PRESENTATION AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE- WE HAVE A- AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY- WITH. WITH THE COMPLEX FUTURE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS THAT ARE RIDING ON THE FUTURE- WE'RE TALKING TO THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR HERE TODAY. AND TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ONLY GAS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY THE WORKERS WHO DO pGOOD BENEFITS- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SERVICING OUR WILL SENSE THE PLACES THAT ARE CLOSEST TO OUR COMMUNITIES TWO MILLION PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN A HALF MILE. I GAS WELL IN CALIFORNIA- YOU DESERVE THE VERY BEST. THIS THIS BILL- WOULD WOULD START TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES WE'VE SEEN IN MIDSTREAM SERVICES- IN THE EXTRACTION PROCESS ITSELF IN THE PLUGGING AND ABANDONING PROCESS WHERE A LOT OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING ISN'T COMING LOCALLY OR EVEN- FROM OUR LOCAL LABOR UNIONS OR SUBCONTRACTORS BUT FROM OUT OF STATE. THEY RECOGNIZE THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE WHO DO THIS WORK IT MAY NOT BE PART OF A TRADE UNION AT THIS POINT- AND- THERE IS NO INTENTION IN THIS MEASURE. TO PUT THOSE PEOPLE OUT OF WORK. SIMPLY TO WRITE A PATHWAY. TO BEING PART OF A MORE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. FOR A PARTICULAR. CLASS OF WORKER. AND THE WORK IS BEING PERFORMED WITH THESE WELL SITES. CAN BE DONE CORRECTLY OR INCORRECTLY AND THAT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE HEALTH PROPERTY OR VIRAL PROTECTION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- CONSTRUCTION DEMOLITION INSTALLATION REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE WORK IN AND THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AN INDICTMENT. OF THE CURRENT WORK GOING ON IN OUR FIELDS- THERE IS SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER AT STAKE THOUGH. WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIVES LIVE IN THE SHADOWS OF THESE OIL AND GAS- IT'S- THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE COULD BE COMING IN FROM TEXAS TO DO THIS WORK- AND DISPLACING OUR OWN CALIFORNIA WORKERS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. SO WITH THIS PHONE HERE TODAY WE'RE HOPING TO FIND SOME GROUND TO WORK ON AS A LEGISLATURE- BY NOT NECESSARILY SAYING- FIGHTING THE FIGHT OVER THE FUTURE OF OIL BUT SAYING TO THE EXTENT WE ARE PRODUCING OIL AND EVEN WHEN WE GO TO TAKE CARE OF BRANDON WELLS AND- AND PLUGGING IN FOR MEDIATION BUT THAT WORK IS DONE. BY SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKS THE VERY BEST IN THE WORLD. SO WITH THAT LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION AS WE GO FORWARD- AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN MEMBERS ARE GOING TO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I AM. RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I'M GONNA TRY TO HOLD IT TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU GUYS KNOW I DEEPLY DEEPLY CARE ABOUT MY DISTRICT. IN THIS BILL ADVERSELY AFFECTS ALMOST TWENTY ONE THOUSAND WORKERS IN MY DISTRICT. TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE SIX POINT 5% WOMEN. THEY'RE 18% UNITED STATES MILITARY VETERANS WITH TRANSFERABLE SKILLS. AND THEY ARE 30% SECOND CANCERS WE GET SECOND CHANCES FROM ALL OVER THE STATE WERE PAROLE OFFICERS GIVE HIM. A PASS OR WHATEVER TEY HAVE TO APPLY FOR TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE LA COUNTY OR- SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY OR WHEREVER THEIR FRIEND. TO MOVE TO A SEPARATE COUNTY- CONTINUOUS COUNTY SO THAT THEY CAN APPLY TO WORK IN THE OIL FIELDS. INDIVIDUALS LIKE JERRY FLORES WHO WOULD FOLLOW HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. TO PULL SOME ON THEM. HIGH SCHOOL THE FULL SOME PIPELINE IS WHAT HE CALLS IT- JERRY FLORES WAS IN AND OUT OF PRISON AND HE MAKES US HUMAN HE TELLS HIS STORY HE SAYS THAT. HIS MOM USED TO GET TOGETHER WITH FOR BAIL MONEY AND NOW HE'S WITH FUEL INDUSTRY IN THE JOB THAT HE GETS WITH THE EXCELLENT BENEFITS. EXCELLENT PAY PACKAGE HE STARTED OUT AS A GENERAL LABOR AND NOW HE IS A SUPERVISOR WHERE HE ACTUALLY MOVES ADD THE BUYING AND SELLING OF OIL PRODUCT. IS A COMPANY TRUCK HE'S A HONEST KIDS PTA HIS SON JUST GOT A- SCHOLARSHIP TO HAWTHORNE UNIVERSITY- HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY. AND IT CHANGED HIS LIFE. IT CHANGED HIS LIFE AND IT CHANGES KIDS LIVES WITH GENERATIONAL. LIKE MR VALDEZ WHO AM FOUND HIMSELF IN AND OUT OF PRISON HE LOST HIS WIFE AND HIS MOTHER RAISED HIS DAUGHTERS- IN THE PARK WHEN HE WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. AND THEN HE RECENTLY REMARRIED AND HE'S USING THE INCOME THAT HE'S ABLE TO USE AND MAKE FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY. TO PETITION FOR HIS WIFE TO HAVE RESIDENCY- THERE'S A REQUIREMENT ON A PETITION PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE CAN FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THEM. PEOPLE LIKE MISTER TAYLOR AND JAMAL AND OTHERS THAT HAVE WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY FOR DECADES- SOME ONLY A FEW YEARS BUT MR TAYLOR HAS WORKED THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS AND HE'S TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY. HE'S PAYING FOR HIS KIDS TO GO TO COLLEGE. THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE I AM FRANKIE NOTICE FRANCIS HE WAS A PHOTO. OF A PERSON THAT CAME OUT OF PRISON IN WOMEN- SHE WENT THROUGH THE OIL INDUSTRY TRAINING PROGRAM AND SHE'S BEEN WORKING IN THE OIL INDUSTRY FOR ELEVEN YEARS AND SHE JUST RECENTLY GOT PROMOTED TO A SAFETY POSITION WHERE SHE HAS A COMPANY TRUCK. AND THERE'S- BENEFITS AND GREAT PAY. I I SHOULD START BY SAYING I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR COMMUNICATION WITH ME ON THIS BILL. IN AND WORKING WITH ME I'M TRYING TO GET HIM TO TAKE AMENDMENTS WOULD GUARANTEE. THAT THESE PEOPLE WOULD NOT LOSE THEIR JOB. I TALK TO THE AUTHOR AND HE SAID THE BILL IS SILENT ON THAT WHICH IT IS THE BILL IS SILENT ON THAT IT SAYS THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THEY WILL LOSE THEIR JOB. BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE IN THIS BILL WITHOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT- THEY WON'T LOSE THEIR JOB FOR THE POSITION THAT THEY HAVE. THE BILL IS A PREMISE ABOUT SAFETY SOMEONE TO GO INTO THAT. LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN PASSED IN THIS THIS BUILDING IN THE PAST- OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES IS REQUIRED EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REPORT THEIR- INCIDENTS- LAST TIME INCIDENCES IT'S RECORDED ON OSHA THREE HUNDRED LOG THAT'S POSTED PUBLICLY EVERY YEAR FOR THIRTY DAYS. AND THEN THAT INFORMATION IS ALSO REPORTED TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS THE CAL OSHA DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WEBSITE. WHERE THAT IF INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO ALL OF US AND THE PUBLIC TO SEE WHAT INDUSTRIES. ARE CONSIDERED SAFE. SO BASED ON CALIFORNIA STATE CALIFORNIA'S WEBSITE YOUR OWN WEBSITE. FOR THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS IN CAL OSHA. IF YOU LOOK AT THE AG INDUSTRY THE T. R. I. R. WHICH IS THE TOTAL REPORTED INCIDENT RATE SO. EVERY TIME YOU HAVE AN INCIDENT AN ACCIDENT YOU HAVE TO REPORT THIS. SO IF YOU TAKE THE AG INDUSTRY THE AGNES TREES FIVE POINT SEVEN. FIVE POINT SEVEN. THE OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION INDUSTRY IS POINT EIGHT. NOT EIGHT POINT EIGHT POINT EIGHT- WASTE WATER SEWER- RELATED CONTRACTS CONTRACTORS THESE ARE ALL CONTRACTORS THAT WORK FOR- THAT- YOU KNOW LICENSE CONTRACTORS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO IF YOU LOOK AT- WASTE WATER SEWER LINE RELATED STRUCTURES THAT DO MUNICIPALITY WATER LINE STRUCTURES AND INSTALL WATER LINES ON IT FOR THE MUNICIPALITIES THEY ARE AND ACCORDING TO THE WEBSITE TWO POINT ONE. THE PEOPLE THAT DO THESE INSTALLATIONS OF WATERS WATER SEWERS ARE TWO POINT ONE WHICH IS CONSIDERED IN THE POSTION STATE. NOW IF YOU LOOK AT OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION OIL AND GAS PIPELINE THE POINT EIGHT. THAT IS IN THE GREEN STAGE OCEAN ISN'T EVEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY THAT THEY HAVE IN THE OIL FIELDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN EXCELLENT SAFETY PROGRAM THAT WAS DESIGNED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND I'LL SHARE THAT INFORMATION IN A SECOND. IF YOU LOOK AT THEM. OIL AND GAS RELATED STRUCTURES WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL. COVERS ITS POINT FIVE SIX FOR ABOVE GROUND. ANY TYPE OF THE BACKGROUND OF BELOW GROUND WORK. IF YOU JUST TAKE KERN COUNTY BECAUSE- AGAIN MY DISTRICT IN KERN COUNTY HAS 70% THAT'S WHERE 70% OF THE WORKERS IN THE OIL AND GAS LIVE BREED RAISE THEIR FAMILIES. PLAY BASEBALL AND GO TO CHURCH OR HAVE FAMILY ACTIVITIES THEY DON'T COME FROM TEXAS. THEY DON'T COME FROM OTHER STATES. THEY ARE NINETY NINE POINT 9% RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND THEY HAVE GREAT JOBS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IF YOU JUST TAKE THAT DISTRICT WHICH IS 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL NOT INCLUDING ANY OTHER COUNTY THAT HAS OIL IN THEIR DISTRICT. WE ARE EIGHT POINT THREE THREE WITH ALL OF THE CONTRACTORS AND I KNOW THAT'S KIND OF HARD TO FOLLOW BUT I WANT YOU TO MIX I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS. THAT THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL THAT IS SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE DOES NOT EXIST IN THE OIL FIELDS. IS COMPLETELY ABSURD. IT REALLY IS. THESE INDIVIDUALS WORK HARD IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE OIL INDUSTRY'S THE MAJORS REALIZE THAT. THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH THE SAFETY PROGRAM THEY WERE MANDATED TO DO THAT THEY WERE LEGISLATED TO DO THAT. THEY CARED ABOUT THE PEOPLE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WENT HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES SAFELY. SO THEY CAME TOGETHER AND THEY WORK TO THE ASSOCIATION CALLED ABC TO PUT TOGETHER A MULTI CRAFT OIL AND GAS TRAINING PROGRAM. WHICH IS REQUIRED TO DO AND GO THROUGH THIS TRAINING PROGRAM BEFORE YOU CAN GO OUT TO ANY POSITION IN THE OIL FIELDS I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE JUST. SHOPPING WEEDS WERE A LOT OF OUR WEST TECH WHICH IS OUR- CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY PEOPLE THAT START THERE. IS IF THEY CAN SHOW UP ON TIME AND THEY CAN SHOW UP EVERY DAY. AND THEY CAN JUST CHOP WEEDS CAN BE- YOU KNOW. IT JUST SHOW UP TO SHOW THAT THEY'LL BE CONSISTENT THEN THEY'LL ELEVATOR A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUAL STARTED. ON THAT WEEK FOR MAINTENANCE CREW. AND NOW THEY RUN COMPLETELY FULL OPERATIONS IN INCLUDING WATER TREE THIS. WHERE WE TAKE WATER THE IS PART. OUT OF THE OIL WELLS AND WE TURN IT INTO GOOD WATER. HAVE A PERMIT AND USE IT TO GIVE IT TO THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. IF YOU LOOK AT. THEM IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAFETY P. SEVEN THIS BILL HAS NO STANDING WHATSOEVER. JUST BECAUSE OF THE NAME AND NUMBERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL OF US ON THE WEB SITE. AT THE BELIEVER STIFFNESS TO STATISTICS. THE AUTHOR SAYS THAT THIS BILL IS SILENT ON THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T. HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR JOBS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL LANGUAGE ITSELF. AND YOU GO TO PAGE THREE. IT SAYS THAT. IT HAPPENED TO THEM THE TREE IT SAYS THAT I'M IN THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES WE PAID AT LEAST THE REPUBLIC TO PREVAILING WAGES A DIRTY PERSON. A PERSON. FOR WAGING OCCUPATION. TO BE REGISTERED AND APPROVED PRETTY SHIP PROGRAM. SO LIKE I SAID I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PREVAILING WAGES FOR CERTAIN OPERATIONS BUT I CAN TELL YOU A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE MAKING X. EXCESS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THE MINIMUM WAGE THAT THEY GET PAID IS ALMOST TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AN HOUR WHEN THEY GO OUT TO THE OIL FIELD TO START ON A WEAKER. NOW I KNOW THAT SAN FRANCISCO AND- YOU KNOW THE- PLACES AND BIG METROPOLIS AREAS THAT'S NOT A VERY GOOD WAGE BECAUSE IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO LIVE IN THOSE CITIES BUT- OUR COST OF LIVING HAS BEEN MAINTAINED IN THE STATE IN KERN COUNTY AND THAT'S EVEN A GREAT WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO START OUT IN. THE OIL FIELDS. THIS BILL ON LINE ITEM NINE REQUIRES THAT APPRENTICES ARE REGISTERED PROGRAMS ARE APPROVED BY THE CHIEF DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS. AND THAT THEY HAVE PROPER CHAINING TRAINING ON THE JOB IN SUPERVISION. THEIR REQUIREMENT THAT AT LEAST SIXTY PERCENT- JOURNEY LEVEL. THE PRINTER. OFFER KEEP UP. THE APPRENTICESHIP OCCUPATION MEANS THE OCCUPATION FOR WHICH THE CHIEF IS APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. IT SAYS AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED A CERTIFICATE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP. COUNCIL AND THE CHIEF COMPLETING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM APPROVED. BY SECTION THREE OH SEVEN BY LABOR CODE. SAYS THE INDIVIDUAL HAS TO COMPLETE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM LOCATED OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA APPROVED FEDERAL% PURPOSES. IF HE SAYS THEY HAVE TO BE A REGISTERED APPRENTICE. IT HAS TO SEE IT WHEN YOU GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF PAGE AND- FIVE OR SKEWS ME FOR AND IT'S A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE NEEDS A WORK FORCE THAT. BOTH HAS THIS NUMBER ONE. ALL WORKERS. ARE EITHER REGISTERED APPRENTICES OR SKILLED JOURNEY LEVELS. AND NUMBER TWO AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWO OF THOSE- PERCENTAGE PROCESS. THESE WORKERS THAT HAVE WORKED SIX MONTHS TWO YEARS FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS MR TAYLOR'S BEEN OUT THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS. THEY'RE GOING TO DISTILL WILL TELL MR TAYLOR MR FLOOR AS MR. VALDEZ THE PEOPLE THAT YOU GUYS WERE US TALKED. TO ON THE ZOOM CALLS. WILL TELL. THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO THEIR JOB. THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO A GOING TO THE BILL SAY THAT GUYS ARE. TO BE LEGISLATE AND YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO TRAINING TO BE A LEGISLATOR. I JUST I IMPLORE YOU TO LOOK AT THE DETAILS. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND THINK. THE FIFTEEN COLLEAGUES. THE FIFTEEN CALLING TO TAKE THE TIME OUT OF THEIR DAY TO GET ON THE PHONE WITH THESE EMPLOYEES AND LET THEM SHARE THEIR- STORIES AND HOW THIS IS THIS BILL WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT HIM. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR TIME I WANT TO THANK YOU THAT YOU WITH THEM. THE USE LIKE I SAID TOOK THE TIME OUT OF YOUR DAY TO- TO MEET WITH THESE EMPLOYEES I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR AT LEAST LISTENING AND THE AUTHOR DID TAKE A PHONE CALL WITH THESE EMPLOYEES HAD A SERIES OF QUESTIONS. COLLEAGUES THIS BILL AFFECTS EVERY SINGLE CONTRACTOR THAT WORKS FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY. THE MAJORS IN THE OIL COMPANIES THE WAY IT WORKS ON THE GROUND THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYEES. THEY CONTRACT OUT A HUGE PORTION OF THEIR WORK IT'S THE CONTRACTORS WITH THESE EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED. THESE EMPLOYEES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THIS TRAINING PROGRAM I'VE ASKED THE AUTHOR TO DO TAKE AMENDMENTS TO GUARANTEE. THAT THESE PEOPLE WILL NOT LOSE THEIR JOB. AND YOU KNOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CHEVRON IS MOVING TOWARDS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT AND THAT CHEVRON IS GOING TO- REQUIRE CONTRACTORS TO WORK UNDER PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS. BUT I WANT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WHICH I'VE GIVEN TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT GUARANTEES THEIR JOB AND IT ALSO GIVES THEM TIME TO GO THROUGH THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. IF THIS BILL. PASSES IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNS IT IN NOVEMBER OR OCTOBER. AND IT TAKES EFFECT IN JANUARY THE MINIMUM TRAINING COURSE FOR SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE ON AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM I BELIEVE IS TWO YEARS. THERE'S NO WAY THESE EMPLOYEES CAN LEAVE THEIR JOB FOR TWO YEARS GO THROUGH A TRAINING PROGRAM TO GO TO THE END OF THE LINE AT THE UNION HALL THIS IS NOT AN ANTI UNION BILL. I HAVE TO APPLAUD THE UNIONS THEY TREAT A LOT OF WATER FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY YOU KNOW I THINK THIS GOVERNOR AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE STARTED TO SHUT DOWN THE OIL INDUSTRY IF THE UNIONS HAD STEPPED UP IN AND- AND HELP THEM. THIS IS NOT AN ANTI UNION BILL THIS IS A PRO WORKER BILL AND I NEED MY PEOPLE AND I SEE MY PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE MY CONSTITUENTS. AND I FELT A LOT OF THEM GET JOBS. I AM. A WANT THIS ONE THAT PEOPLE REPRESENT THE OIL INTO. IN MY DISTRICT IN THIS STILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS CURRENT COUNTY. SO I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR TAKING THE TIME TO- TO MEET WITH THESE PEOPLE. AND TO LISTEN TO THEIR STORIES. AND AGAIN THE PREMISE OF THE BILL IS SAFETY THE DATA ON THE WEBSITE DEBUNKS NOW. AND I RESPECTFULLY RESPECTFULLY BEG FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR WENER AND THEN SENATOR ALAN SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE AS BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY KNOW I'VE BEEN. AND I'VE LEGISLATION ON THIS. EARLIER THIS YEAR AN ADVOCATE FOR MOVING CALIFORNIA AWAY FROM OIL EXTRACTION. IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY WE NEED TO PHASE OUT. OF FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION IN CALIFORNIA- AND FRANKLY ALTERNATELY. EVERYWHERE BECAUSE WE'RE DESTROYING THE PLANET- BY OUR OVER RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS- AND WE ARE AT RISK OF CREATING A PLANET THAT WILL BE UNINHABITABLE. FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND WE HAVE THE FIRES AND THE SEA LEVEL RISE IN THE FLOODING AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND WE NEED TO BE. HAVE A MUCH GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY THEN FRANKLY THE STATE HAS. ABOUT ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENDING OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM OIL EXTRACTION- AND THIS BILL I THINK WAS- INTRODUCED AS A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION. BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN THE OIL INDUSTRY. THAT THERE IS A REAL TRANSITION NOT TO LIKE pTHE JOBS THAT ARE. A THOUSAND MILES AWAY- BUT GOOD. JOBS IN MY VIEW OAKLEY UNION JOBS- WHERE THEY ARE. AND WE HAVE A HUGE NEED FOR CAPPING ORPHAN WELLS AND REMEDIATING OILFIELDS HUGE MASSIVE UNMET NEEDS THAT WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH NOW. THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPLICATED INFRASTRUCTURE WORK. AND IT SHOULD BE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE THAT IS DOING THAT WORK BECAUSE WE IT SHOULD BE SKILLED AND TRAINED PERIOD THAT'S A GOOD THING IN TERMS OF. HAVING THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY WORK- BUT IT ALSO WILL BE A TRANSITION. FOR THOSE OIL WORKERS. BECAUSE THAT WORK HAPPENS TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY NEAR WHERE THE OIL EXTRACTION IS HAPPENING OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE HE'S OUR PREVIOUS. BILLS SO IT CAN BE A WIN WIN AND SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE. OF WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IN MOVING US. TOWARDS A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE AND IS FOR MEDIATION- EFFORTS. BY QUESTION THE AUTHOR- IF THE AUTHOR WILL TAKE THE QUESTION HERE AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. IS NOT ABOUT ME QUESTION THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF THE BILL- BUT I DO. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORKERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY DOING THE WORK ARE GOING OR NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOBS- ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO. LEAVE AS WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE CONCERNS POTENTIALLY LEAVE A JOB TO DO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. TO COME BACK AND I KNOW HAVING SPOKEN WITH- FOLKS IN THE BUILDING TRADES WITH THE AUTHOR THAT IS NOT THE INTENT- MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INTENT IS TO THAT THERE CAN BE. A SMOOTH TRANSITION FOR THESE pBILL RIGHT NOW THE I DON'T I DON'T SEE THAT. AS AS BEING CLEARLY OUTLINED IN THE BILL AND I THINK FOR ME AND FOR A LOT OF US- WHO WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING- WE WOULD LIKE THAT INSURANCE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE- WANT THESE PEOPLE TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. SO- QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. WE TAKE A QUESTION CENTERS TURN YES. SEND ARENA- SO TO THE AUTHORS ARE THROUGH THE CHAIR- ARE YOU- WILLING. TO MAKE AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY- TO CLARIFY THAT THESE WORKERS WILL NOT BE FIRED BECAUSE THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THAT CREDIT SHOULD STATUS AND IT- OR AND THE LAY OUT A PROCESS. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR JOBS. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE PRESENT HERE THANK YOU- THANK YOU MY COLLECTION SERVICES CO AND FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE I'M- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE WORK FORCE IMPACTED HERE I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL- THE EMPLOYEES OF AN OWNER OPERATOR. SO I THINK THE QUESTION IS ABOUT- THE CONTRACTORS OR SUBCONTRACTORS I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR BECAUSE THE BILL ALREADY EXPLICITLY EXAMS ALL EMPLOYEES OF ALL THE OWNER OPERATORS. IT'S REALLY WHEN THEY CONTRACT OUT- WHETHER THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR PREVAILING WAGE. I THINK WE- WANT TO MAKE SURE I GOT YOUR QUESTION RIGHT BUT JUST TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO- PAGE SIX. IT'S VERY CLEAR THIRTY ONE EIGHTY FOUR I THINK I PAID SIX SECTION IS NOT APPLIED AT A CHLOE'S OF AN OWNER OPERATOR THE WEATHER PRODUCTION FACILITY OR PREVENT THE OWNER OPERATOR FROM USING ITS OWN EMPLOYEES TO PERFORM ANY OF THE WORK THAT HASN'T BEEN ASSIGNED. TO CONTRACTORS- BODY PLAYS THE CONTRACTOR PRESENT AND WORKING- SO. IF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SORT OF. THE CONTRACTED OUT WORK. THE CHALLENGE I HAVE WITH. I DON'T KNOW QUITE HOW TO ACHIEVE THE MECHANICS YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I DON'T WANT TO UNDERCUT PREVAILING WAGE IN ANYWAY HERE- SO. YOU KNOW. IF THE IF THE IF WE'RE SAYING WE WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO SAY. KEEP THAT JOB THEY HAVE NOW BUT THEY'RE BEING BEING PAID SUBSTANDARD WAGES I WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE THAT IMAGE TO ME THAT UNDERCUTS THE PREMISE OF THE BILL. I THINK. VIEW THE WAY IN PRACTICE THIS LEGISLATION THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION IS WORK WE PASSED A SIMILAR MEASURE IN THE REFINERY SECTOR- SP FIFTY FOUR I THINK IT WAS. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN HERE MAYBE SIX SIX SEVEN YEARS AGO. THERE'S AN EXPEDITED TRAINING PROGRAM. THAT- THAT WAS USED FOR ACCOUNTING BOTH PASTELS I WORKED IN THE FIELD AS WELL AS- SORT OF PERCENTAGE BASIS SO IN PRACTICE IN OTHER WORDS THE WAY THE INDUSTRY WE BELIEVE WOULD MANAGE THE IMPLEMENTATION IS LEGISLATION WOULD BE THAT ON A CRAFT BASIS NOT A 100% WOULD HAVE TO NECESSARILY COMPLETE ALL THE STANDARD APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT TO YOUR TIMELINE. OF SORT OF YOU HAVE TO BE FIRED FROM YOUR JOB AND WAIT I DON'T THAT TERM IS DOESN'T COMPORT WITH HOW INDUSTRY PRACTICES IT HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED- SO I WOULD. JUST SAY. LOOK AT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS ENACTED AWAY ANYONE'S JOB. BUT IT IS TO PUSH THE EMPLOYER'S SPECIALLY THE CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO STEP UP. INSERTING PREVAILING WAGE SO I WANT TO JUST CLEAR I MEAN ASK A QUESTION BACK TO THE QUESTION BUT I DON'T WANT. THE KIND OF AMENDMENT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IF YOU WOULD ALLOW. THEN THIS SORT OF CURRENT PRACTICES TO CONTINUE I WOULDN'T BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT- BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU HAVE IN MIND AND I'M I'M OPEN. REGULAR WINNER THANK YOU- AND SO THROUGH THE THROUGH THE CHAIR- I FULLY AGREE I DON'T WANT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE HAPPENS TO WORK FOR A CONTRACTOR INSTEAD OF THE OIL PRODUCER THAT THEY DON'T GET THE PREVAILING WAGE IN THERE- HARMS AS A RESULT. AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THOSE WORKERS ALSO BEING TRANSITIONS TO HAVING YOU KNOW. THAT THOSE ALL THE SKILLED WORKFORCE PREVAILING WAGE PROTECTIONS DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE WORKING FOR A CONTRACT. BUT THE QUESTIONS FOR THOSE NUMEROUS WORKERS WHO ARE WORKING FOR CONTRACTORS WHAT IS THE PATH GOING TO BE FOR THEM RIGHT I I'M AS I MENTIONED ARE NOT GOING TO. LOSE THEIR JOBS THEY HAVE TO WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS ARE THEY GONNA HAVE TO GO TO THE BACK OF THE LINE FOR. APPRENTICESHIPS AND I ANSWER THE QUESTION THE AUTHOR IS YOU COULD NOT NOT TO SOMEHOW EXEMPT THEM SO THEY'RENOT GETTING PREVAILING WAGE- THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS. THIS I WOULD WANT THE BILL TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE PATHWAY IS. FOR THEM AS WELL THAT THAT'S MY THAT'S THE QUESTION OKAY- THAT'S HELPFUL- G. DEPARTMENT. OF PRISONS IF YOU DON'T MIND- SO. THEN WALK BACK THROUGH THE TRANSITION PROCESS. NOT HERE- SO SKILLED AND TRAINED PROCESS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT ONLY REQUIRES A PRINTER SHOULD GRADUATE IN A PERCENTAGE SAYS SAY FROM 3260% BY CRAFT SO THE OTHER. TEN FORTY REMAINING DOESN'T REQUIRE SORT OF- COMPLETE- SKILL AND TRAIN UP AND DOWN THE RANKS SO IN THEORY IF THERE WERE SOME OF THESE FOLKS WHO WERE IN- EXISTING. BANK WITH EXISTING CONTRACTORS OR SUBCONTRACTORS BECAUSE A LOT OF HIS WORK AT SUBCONTRACTED BY THE WAY- AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY DON'T WORK FOR ANYBODY- AND SORT OF HAVE TO GO TO JOB TO JOB AS JOURNEYMEN AND- WOMEN AND MOSTLY NINE TO BE HONEST- BUT- BUT DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW LONG TERM BENEFITS- DON'T HAVE THE STABILITY OF A FULL TIME THING SO. THE ONLY TIME THE PL THEY REQUIRE APPEAL LADY S REQUIRED IF THE OWNER OPERATOR OXEN THIS BILL DOES NOT MANDATE ANY DELAYS. SO THEY CAN KIND OF MAKING KEEP CONTRACTING HOW THEY WANT A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE APPRENTICESHIP PROCESS. BUT IT DOESN'T. REQUIRE EVERYONE TO GO THROUGH IT SO. IF THAT NEEDSBE. CLARIFIED MORE HELP INDUSTRY PRACTICE WORKS- I'M I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT IN SOME KIND OF FINDING OR- OR AN EXPLANATION BUT I. I'M JUST I'M I'M- I'M A LITTLE CAUTIOUS ABOUT- ADAPTING ITS WHOLESALE AN AMENDMENT THAT. COULD HAVE- COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR SORT OF ALLOWING THAT THAT KIND OF CONTRACTING TO KEEP GOING ON I THINK THAT THAT DENIGRATES THE QUALITY OF THE WORK I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM SO- I CONCERNED THAT'S AN UNSATISFYING ANSWER BUT- I THINK THAT IF WE CAN ARTICULATE MORE THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE GOING FORWARD AND HOW THE THERE'S ALREADY CONTRACTUAL ABILITIES TO DO THIS WORK MAYBE THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME SOME- SOLACE TO FOLKS. THANK YOU SENATOR AND SENATOR WIENER. OKAY VERY GOOD SENATOR ALLEN EUROPE NEXT. MEMBERS I- I BELIEVE I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW I- I WILL I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND CONCEPTS- VOTED FOR INTERMEDIATE- BUT I REALLY DO SHARE A LOT OF THE CORE CONCERNS WE JUST RAISED BY THE CENTER FOR SAN FRANCISCO- I WAS ABLE TO LISTEN TO THE AUTHOR'S. ANSWER THERE SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY TO WHAT I THINK INITIALLY TO MANY OF US SEEM LIKE A SIMPLE PROBLEM WHICH IS HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT FOLKS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THESE RAKES FOR TWENTY YEARS AND KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING I HAVEN'T HAD ANY SAFETY PROBLEMS ARE NOT GOING TO. BE REALLY I'M JUSTIFIABLY JAMMED UP BY A BY A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO LEAVE WORK OFTEN BE BE TRAINED TO DO THE VERY WORK THEY'VE BEEN DOING FOR DECADES- SO I THINK THE CONCERN IT'S OUT THRE- AMONGST MANY OF THE MEMBERS IS HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE DO RIGHT BY THESE WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN. WORKING SO HARD IN THE FIELD FOR SO LONG WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS- WHILE THE SAME TIME ACHIEVING THE VERY NOBLE- WORKER PROTECTION LONG TERM WORKER PROTECTION GOALS THAT I THINK ARE AT THE HEART OF THIS BILL SO I. TRIED MY BEST TO LISTEN TO THE DISCUSSION- IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY HERE I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE DEALING WITH- WITH- AND- IT'S- IT'S A BROADER CONCERNS ABOUT NOT. DOING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT. UNDERMINE OUR AS SOME KIND OF CORPORATE VENTURE CORPORATE SCHOOLS REALLY KNOWS TO PREVAILING WAGE ANOTHER. PROTECTION SO. I'M CERTAIN I GUESS YET WE GOT A WHOLE DAY NOW I SUPPOSE TO SEE IF YOU CAN LAND SOME OF THESE COMPLEX ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AND- I'LL BE WATCHING THIS DISCUSSION CLOSELY. AND BUT I DO I DO WANT TO. ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THESE PRODUCTS ARE IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. HI AND THROW IN A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN WORKING- IN THESE IN THESE RATES FOR A LONG TIME UNDER THE BUS. AS WE'RE DOING RIGHT BY- BY WORKERS IN THE FUTURE AS WE AS WE TRY TO PUT THESE PROTECTIONS YOU'RE LOOKING TO PUT IN PLACE- IN A LONG TERM. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO SENATOR NEWMAN PORTENT TINO CALL MARGARET RUSSELL AND THEN SENATOR LOAN CENTER NEWMAN THE PLEASURE CENTER EIGHT WHEN I GOT YOU. DATE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OF I'LL BE BRIEF I WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN FRANCISCO I'M FROM SANTA MONICA. I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD- FOR HER DILIGENT- AND RELENTLESS WORK ON BEHALF OF HER CONSTITUENTS. THAT IS DOING HIS JOB EXACTLY HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE. SHE HAS BEEN ACCESSIBLE AND REASONABLE SHE'S CONNECTED US- TERROR CONSTITUENTS WE'VE ALL HAD A NUMBER OF REALLY INTERESTING AND CONCERNING CONVERSATIONS. AS IT RELATES TO THEIR LIVES. AND THE JEOPARDY THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES APPARENTLY UNDER AND SO WITH THAT. I WOULD URGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. BOTH WITH OUR COLLEAGUES BUT THROUGH AT THE CENTER FROM BAKERSFIELD- AND LET'S FIND A SOLUTION. THAT DOES NOT PUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF FRESH OUT. OF- KERN COUNTY AND ELSEWHERE. OUT OF WORK FOR REALLY NO REASON AT ALL OTHER THAN. A LACK OF DILIGENCE ON OUR PART THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN CENTER PORTENT TINA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I'M RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR NINETEEN AND I ECHO THE COMMENTS OF- MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY THAT- THIS IS BEEN A VERY HEALTHY DEBATE- I HAVE FAITH IN IN THE AUTHOR AND THE GOAL OF THE BILL TO BRING- BETTER STANDARDS AND WORKER PROTECTIONS. TO AN INDUSTRY- AND SO I I'M GOING SUPPORTED TODAY AND- THINK THE ROBUST DEBATES HEALTHY AND- ONE WANTED TO CONTINUE SO I THINK IT SHOULD GE OUT OF THIS HOUSE OF THAT CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE THANK YOU SENATOR PORTENT TINO CENTER COM LONGER. SENATOR COM LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT YOU KNOW- YOU COME TO THE FLOOR AND YOU THINK SOMEONE'S GONNA YOU KNOW GOING TO GO DOWN ROUTE EIGHTY AND YOU END UP ON RUBY- AS I WAS LISTENING TO. THE DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT. V. NUMEROUS CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS HAPPENING. IN MY DISTRICT. WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS ROBUST DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE A DIVERSE WORK FORCE. AND INVARIABLY IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WE ARE TOLD WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH AFRICAN AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE APPRENTICES HE CAN BE ON THIS CONSTRUCTION SITE. AND SO THE FEW THAT YOU SEE ARE THE ONES HOLDING THE STOP SIGNS. NOT REALLY FULLY BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN AN APPRENTICE OR JOURNEYMAN EXPERIENCE TO GET THE KIND OF TRAINING THAT THEY NEED. NOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF UNIONS- IN LA THAT ARE WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS AND GREAT PARTNERSHIPS. I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT BUT THAT IS A CONCERN SO AS I WAS LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT. AND WHAT WE HAVE ALSO. LEARNED AND SEEN. IS THAT WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO GET THE WORK FORCE THAT THEY NEED. THEY IMPORT THE TRAINED WORKERS. FROM OTHER STATES TO COME ON TO THE JOB SITES TO COMPLETE THE WORK. WORDING UNION. WORKERS BUT THEY ARE NOT COMING FROM OUR CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOODS. AND SO THIS MAY BE A QUESTION FOR THAT- THE AUTHORS TO THE CHAIR OR MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS BUT I TOO AM CONCERNED THAT WE ARE- UNKNOWINGLY OR UNWITTINGLY OPENING UP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS WHO CURRENTLY WORK THESE JOBS- TO BE FOR WHATEVER REASON SHIFTED OFF OF THEM- BECAUSE OF THE GOOD INTENTION OF THE BILL AND THEN ALLOWING OTHER FOLKS TO COME INTO OUR STATE TO GRAB THOSE JOBS BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST NOT ENOUGH OF X. KIND OF WORKER. OR B. KIND OF WORKER WHO IS APPROPRIATELY AND ADEQUATELY TRAINED TO PERFORM THESE JOBS I KNOW THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE DIFFERENT ACROSS THE STATE SO I AM ONLY SPEAKING ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE IN LOS ANGELES- BUT THIS IS A CONCERN I HAVE THE OIL FIELD IN MY DISTRICT MY DISTRICT IS. A FEROCIOUSLY TRYING TO CLOSE IT THE REALITY IS MOST OF THE FOLKS THAT WORK AT THAT SITE OUR BLACK AND BROWN. BEEN ABLE TO PUT THEIR KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE AND THEIR GRANDKIDS THROUGH COLLEGE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE OIL INDUSTRY AND ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR SITE. I WOULD HATE TO WAKE UP- HEY AND SEE THAT WE'RE NOT WALKING THE WALK AROUND JUST TRANSITION BUT B. I WOULD HATE TO WAKE UP AND SEE THAT ALL OF THOSE FOLKS THAT WORK THERE. HAVE NOW BEEN REPLACED BY OTHER FOLKS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY WORK SO MAYBE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE IT IS REALLY LEGITIMATE. YOU KNOW THE SUBS. AND THE SUBS THEY'RE LOOKING TO FINISH THE JOB. THEY DON'T CARE WHO THE PERSON IS. DIVERSITY BE SO IF WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE CREATING DIVERSITY IN A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT HOW SUBS MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY'RE ASKED TO MEET WHICHIS TO HAVE FOLKS ON THESE JOBS THAT KNOW HOW TO DO THE JOB AND ARE TRYING TO DO THE JOB- AND THAT MAY. REALLY PUSHES SO MANY OF OUR PEOPLE OUT OF THOSE JOBS IN ONTO THE YOU KNOW EDT ROLES WHERE WE KNOW THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GET PHONES ANSWERED AND CLAIMS APPROVED THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER CALM WATER AND SINISTER MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS IN YOUR CLOTHES WE'RE NOW GOING TO CENTRE TORONTO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VENTURE- I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS. HAS MOVED THE INTO AN ISSUE ABOUT WORKERS GETTING FIRED I UNDERSTAND THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THIS AND I'VE LIVED WITH THIS AND WORKED IN AND- THROUGH THE LABOR MOVEMENT- WITH THE BUILDING TRADES ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME MANY MANY YEARS. AND WE HAVE ADDRESSED WITH DRESSED IN A VERY SERIOUS WAY A LOT OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP INCLUDING. THE HIRING FROM WHERE LOCAL HIRE- THE NUMBERS OF LOCAL HIRE ALL OF THAT. BUT THIS IS ALL ABOUT TO ME IS A STANDARD. THAT WE AS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE SETTING AND REINFORCING AND SUPPORTING IT'S ABOUT A STANDARD. AND EVERY COMPANY CONTRACTOR SUBCONTRACTOR THAT GETS HIRED BY THE MAIN OWNER OPERATOR EMPLOYER COMPANY. THAT THEY HAVE TO FULFILL THAT STANDARD THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT A STANDARD OF WHAT TRAINING THEY'RE GOING TO GET. A QUALITY TRAINING. THAT IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SAFETY SERIOUSLY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SAFETY- WHAT THEIR WAGES ARE GOING TO BE WHAT THEIR BENEFITS ARE GOING TO BE. ALL THOSE THINGS THAT'S THE STANDARD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEREWITH THIS BILL IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRING WORKERS. AND THIS IS B. COM HAS BEEN CHANGED INTO A WHOLE DIFFERENT CONVERSATION HERE AS A WAY TO GET OVER TO GET TO GET AWAY FROM THE CORE ISSUE. THIS IS THE CORE ISSUE AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE EVERY EMPLOYER FROM THE TOP TO THE MIDDLE TO THE BOTTOM EVERY EMPLOYER MEET A HIGH QUALITY STANDARD. AND WE WANT THAT NOT FOR ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN FOR THE GOOD OF THOSE WORKERS THAT THOSE WORKERS KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET THAT KIND OF TRAINING WHEN THEY GET THAT QUALITY TRAINING. THEY'RE CERTIFIED AND THEY CAN WORK ON THESE PROJECTS AND THEY'LL GET PAID WHAT THEY DESERVE SO I REALLY YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS BEEN TWISTED INTO WORKERS ARE GOING TO GET FIRED. IT'S A REALLY SMART WAY OF DISTRACTING FROM THE CORE ISSUE HERE THE CORE ISSUE IS SKILLED TRAINED WORKERS. AND THE ABILITY TO. PUT THOSE MEN AND WOMEN TO WORK. ALL THE OTHER ISSUES I AGREE WITH I WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT WITH THE BUILDING TRADES OVER MANY YEARS. THE DONE AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB OF. CHANGING THE CULTURE TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR RECRUIT MORE WOMEN ARE RECRUITED FROM THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED YOU NAME IT EVERY GROUP THAT HAS BEEN X. IS ACTIVELY BEING RECRUITED. I'VE SEEN IT I'VE GONE TO THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THE ACTUAL TRAINING PROGRAMS I WAS JUST IN FRESNO A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO DURING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL CONSTRUCTION SITES. SO YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S JUST FOCUS ON WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO DO AND THAT IS A QUALITY STANDARD OF LIVING AND WORKING. FOR THOSE MEN AND WOMEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO SENATOR LAMONT. CALLING I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENING AND I THINK YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES TALKED A LOT ABOUT A HIGH QUALITY STANDARD AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS- IN IN I THINK OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION TWO DAYS. THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE THAT'S ALLOWED FOR LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS LEGISLATIVE INPUT AND LEGISLATIVE REVIEW. AND I ALSO THINK OF THE FACT THAT THOSE WHO ARE SUPPORTING- THIS PROCESS- HAVE YOU NOR ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS BILL BUT HAVE NOT ALLOWED THAT CONVERSATION FOR OTHER BILLS. AND I WONDER YOU KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE A TRUE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT ALL OF THIS NEEDS. TO BE ALL ENERGY JOBS NOT JUST TO THE OIL INDUSTRY WE HAVE A LIMITED OURSELVES NOT JUST IN THIS HOUSE BUT IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO ALLOWING THOSE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN. I HAVE HEARD COLLEAGUES TODAY SAY I AM HAPPY THAT THIS ROBUST CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING WHAT ABOUT FOR OTHER SECTORS. THESE ARE ALL VALID POINTS. WAGES. SAFETY STANDARD. IMPORTERS LOCAL HIRE WHERE ARE THOSE OTHER CONVERSATIONS AND I HOPE THAT AS THIS BILL POTENTIALLY MOVES FORWARD IT HIGHLIGHTS HOW MUCH THESE CONVERSATIONS CAN FEED INTO AN OUTCOME THAT HELPS EVERYONE AND I THINK THAT AS I'VE HEARD COLLEAGUES AND YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD- WE'RE NOT ALWAYS ON THE SAME SIDE OF ENERGY BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY ROBUST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO THE EVERYDAY CALIFORNIAN AND HOW WE TRANSITION THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING IN THIS SPACE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE PART OF A UNION. THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN THAT AND SO I THINK THAT THIS ISN'T YOU KNOW IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL HAS GENERATED A NEEDED CONVERSATION BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE COMMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE ARE NOT SIMPLY LIMITED TO IT SHOULD NOT IN MY OPINION BE SIMPLY LIMITED TO THIS SOURCE OF ENERGY THERE ARE MANY ENERGY JOBS OUT THERE THAT NEED THIS CONVERSATION- AND SO I HOPE THAT IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY- WE DON'T LIMIT OURSELVES TO THIS I HOPE THERE'S A COMMITMENT FROM. EVERYONE INVOLVED BOTH SUPPORTERS AND THOSE THAT FEEL THAT THIS BILL MAY HAVE LIMITATIONS TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS AND SOLVE FOR A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES. THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY THANK YOU. THANK CENTER LAMONT SENATOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS IT HAS BEEN A VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION. AND I WILL SAY I WAS SITTING NEXT TO THE SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD DURING COMMITTEE WHEN HIS BILL CAME THROUGH AND I HAVE CERTAINLY FELT AND HEARD HER PASSION ON THIS TOPIC- ALSO THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT AREAS AND IN A SPECIALLY IN THE VALLEY AND IN THE CENTER FROM BAKERSFIELD HER HER CAN HURT THE- ECONOMY IS MOSTLY AG AND AN OIL MADE UP THAT IS. THAT IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE ECONOMY AND LET'S NOT BE LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES BOTH OF THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE OFTEN UNDER ATTACK IN THIS HOUSE SUCH I MEAN IT'S JUST THE NATURE I THINK OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE OPERATE. AND I'M AND WE ALL BELIEVE IN A IN A AT PEOPLE BEING PAID A DECENT WAGE WE ALL BELIEVE THOSE THINGS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT DRESS THAT JUST TRANSITION FOR ALL WORKERS- I HAVE ALSO TALKED TO THOSE WORKERS AND THEY ARE MAJORITY BLACK AND BROWN WHO LIVE IN THAT AREA. OF FOLKS IN AREAS LIKE WE REPRESENT THAT OFTENTIMES THEY GO IN THE MILITARY OR THE PRISON SOMETIMES BOTH AND WHEN THEY COME BACK TO FAMILIES ARE THERE AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING SO I WOULD CERTAINLY ASK THAT THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO DISPLACE THOSE WORKERS BUT HELP PEOPLE COME ALONG AND NOT TO ME WE CAN TALK ABOUT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO ACHIEVE A STANDARD. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS IN THIS BUILDING ABOUT EQUITY AND EQUALITY AND SOMETIMES THAT THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS AND SOMETIMES THERE IS A LOT BIGGER BRIDGE- THAT FOLKS NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE- AND RUSHING TO DO THAT I THINK THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO. IS UPSET AND ECONOMY AND THAT HAS CREATED A MIDDLE CLASS LIFE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO OWN THEIR HOME SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE THOSE ARE THE EXACT KIND OF THINGS WE WANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES OF GENERATIONAL WEALTH IN THIS HOUSE RIGHT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT ABILITY TO OWN A HOME IN THE PAST. THAT ON YOUR KID THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF THESE WERE OCCURS IN THE BIGGEST CURRENT- WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. AND SO AS WE RUSSIAN AND LET'S NOT PRETEND THE BUILDING TRADES DON'T HAVE A LOT OF. POWER IN THIS ROOM IN THIS BUILDING OKAY. AND LET'S NOT PRETEND LIKE THIS THIS BILL IS NOT HELPFUL FOR THEM ALL RIGHT THAT'S THAT THAT IS JUST WHAT IT IS. SO THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO HELP THEM WE WANT EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO BE PROTECTED. IF THEY CHOOSE TO BE AND YOU NEED TO BE IN THE UNION. BUT LET'S NOT PRETEND AND LET HIS BLOOD IS TO BE VERY HONEST ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION. THIS BILL IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN COME BACK OVER HERE. THAT I THINK WE ARE VERY SERIOUS AND MY- CALLING FROM SANTA BARBARA MAKES THIS POINT TOO. ABOUT HOW DO WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT NOT LEAVING EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WORKING IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS IN THEIR AREA THERE ARE LOCAL. AND THEN WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DISPLACE THEM. BY SOME OF OUR LARGER. GOOD GOALS RIGHT THE GOOD GIRLS WHO WANT TO DO BUT LET'S NOT LEAVE PEOPLE BEHIND I THINK THAT HOPEFULLY IS WHAT CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT WE TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN OTHER SECTORS AND IN OTHER AREAS THAT WE LIKE TO WORK IN. LET'S DO THE SAME WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I ALSO APPRECIATE. THE SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD WHO COMMUNICATES WITH PASSION. AND FAX AND IN A REAL HEART FOR HER ONSTITUENCY. AND ALL FORTY OF OUR VOICES SHOULD MATTER IN THIS ROOM. AND ALL FORTY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE REPRESENT. ALSO SHOULD HAVE THE REPRESENTATION. THAT IS. PROMISED TO US IN THIS REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. THANK YOU CENTER EDMUNDSON. BETTER PRESENT MEMBERS- AGAIN I WAS NOT GOING TO GET UP AND SPEAK ON THIS BILL AND I'VE HEARD THIS DIALOGUE. WHICH HAS BEEN A ROBUST AND FOR MY GOOD- CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES HERE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE DO HAVE HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS. FOR LABOR IN THE STATE BUT WORDS ON A BILL MATTER. WORDS ON A BILL MATTER AND FOR MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND SANTA MONICA I APPRECIATE THE WAY THEY FRAMED THEIR DEBATE I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT IT I THINK THESE ARE GREAT UNION JOBS NOBODY SUGGESTING THAT EVEN ANY OF THESE PEOPLE I WILL NOT BE UNIONIZED MEMBERS BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE. SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR- I DON'T EVEN THINK GRANDFATHER IS AN APPROPRIATE WORD I THINK TRANSITION. THERE NEEDS TO BE A TRANSITION PLAN THERE NEEDS TO BE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL I'VE TALKED TO THE BUILDING TRADES MYSELF. IT FOR- THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL FROM LOS ANGELES WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS ISSUE ALL WEEK AND LAST WEEK AS WELL WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND THIS BILL. DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. AND WE'RE NOT THERE SO I WOULD ASK LIKE TO ASK THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES ONE FINAL QUESTION OR- SINISTER WE TAKE A QUESTION SURE YES FOR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. ARE YOU WILLING TO MAKE CLEAR. THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A TRANSITION PLAN SO EMPLOYEES. ARE NOT MOVES ARE NOT MOVED OUT OF THEIR JOBS. FUEL FOR THE FOR ANY TYPE OF TRAINING I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR I JUST DON'T WANT THESE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS I THINK THAT'S QUITE CLEAR THE THIRTY TO SIXTY. WHAT AND THEN ONE FINAL POINT TO THE CENTER. THE 3260% YOU SAY. IF THERE IS A PERCENTAGE THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE FROM DIFFERENT FROM DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS. THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THAT. IS JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO THIS BILL PASSES. AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THIS BILL LET'S JUST SAY IT AS IT IS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE LIKE TWO OR THREE MONTHS TO DO THAT THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME SO ARE YOU WILLING TO DO TO WORK IN THIS BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE WRONGS IN WRITING IN THE BILL ARE RIGHT INTO THE SATISFACTION OF A LOT OF YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE FLOOR. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MY COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA AND I APPRECIATE THE FRUSTRATION AND I HAVE BEEN- WELL BRIEFED ON. ON THE CONCERNS. I DO THINK FACTS MATTER I THINK WORDS AN APPEAL MATTER. FOR A LOT OF. ACCOLADES GIVEN FOR FACTS SO I FIGURED THAT THAT SPIRIT. APPOINTEE TO THE TRANSITION PLAN IN THE BILL- THOSE WHO WANT TO DIG INTO THE DETAILS HERE. AS OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO. 70% OF THE WORK FORCE CAN REMAIN AS IS. NO ONE IS GETTING FIRED ON DAY ONE. THAT'S A RED HERRING. SO I KNOW WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT IT'S SOME KIND OF PREMISE OF THE BILL AND PEOPLE HAVE BESTED INTERESTS IN THESE KINDS OF EXISTING CONTRACTING RELATIONSHIPS CONTINUING. 70% OF THE WORKFORCE CAN'T CONTINUE. FOR THE REMAINING 30% LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH SKILLED AND TRAINED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM RIGHT AWAY I. THE DEFINITION. OF SKILL JOURNEY PERSON IS IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDING. YOU CAN EITHER BE IN SKILLS AND TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. YOUR JOURNEY PERSONS THIS IS FOR THE REMAINING 30% NOT THE SEVENTY YOU CAN BE ANYONE EXISTING EMPLOYEES BUT THAT REMAINING THIRTY. THAT REMAINING THIRTY. AS TO EITHER BE SKILLED AND TRAINED. OR IS A SKILL JOURNEY PERS AND ENTER ANY PERSON UNDER THE BILL SAYS. CAN JUST HAVE IT AT LEAST AS MANY HOURS OF ON THE JOB EXPERIENCE IN THE APPLICABLE OCCUPATION. SO. EIGHT AM I MEAN I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO GET A COMMON PREMISE HERE ABOUT HOW THE BILL WORKS. IF YOU CUT EVERYONE OFF ON DAY ONE. AGAIN MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE WORK FORCE DOES NOT EVEN HAVE TO BE A SKILL JOURNEY PERSON DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE PAID PREVAILING WAGE RIGHT AWAY. THAT IS THE TRANSITION THEN IN TWENTY THREE THAT GOES UP TO FORTY FIVE PERCENT. AND TWENTY FOURTH CLOSE 260% SO I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT A- GROUNDED. SOME OF OUR CONVERSATION IN IN THE WORDS OF THE BILL. HERE IF FOR SOME REASON. THOSE PERCENTAGES IF FOLKS WANT TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TARGET. IF THERE'S SOME. YOU KNOW- YOU ANT TO STEER STEP OF FORTY FIVE OKAY MAKE IT FORTY PERCENT. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT BUT- THERE IS A TRANSITION PLAN IN THIS BILL LET'S BE CLEAR ON WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON HERE- SO I JUST. I APPRECIATE THE FRUSTRATION BUT I THINK WE'VE WE'VE GOT A- SOME SOME MISTAKES IN OUR PREMISES ABOUT HOW THIS BILL FUNCTIONS- IT DOESN'T FORCE UNIONIZATION. BUT WHY WOULD WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. THANK WHY WOULD WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IN THESE THESE PROFESSIONS ACTUALLY TWENTY UNION COULD TURN A PRESSURE COOKER WE'RE BY THE WAY 75% OF PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THEN IT IS A PRETTY PROGRAMS HAVE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA SO WHEN I CAN IMPORT A BUNCH OF TEXAS WORKERS LIKE WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW READ A PRESS. RELEASE ON. WELL THAT LET'S UNDERSTAND FINISH AND I. HAVEN'T HAD IT HAS RECEDED SO MY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WOULD BE. YOU'VE GOT A TRANSITION BUILT IN YOU CAN TRANSITION DURING THE BILL RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T WANT 70% TO BE JOURNEY PERSONS HERS OR PREMISES BUTTON HOW MUCH. I FEEL LIKE 70% IS A LOT TO OFFER TO KEEP DOING THE GRANDFATHER IN 70% OF THE WORKFORCE SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD OFFER- SO I JUST I GOT TO GET A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC AND I HATE TO DRILL DOWN. SORRY TO USE THE- PUT IN THERE BUT- I GOT IT GOT TO DRILL DOWN THE DETAILS HERE BECAUSE- IT. OPENED UP PAGE FIVE OF THE BILL AND IT'S SITTING RIGHT THERE. SPIKE THAT WAS SICK ARE YOU DENSE ANDERSON WITH RAM YES OKAY SENATOR DODD- I'M QUESTION. I APPRECIATE THE CENTERS FOR. PROMOTES ANGELUS ATTEMPT TO TRY TO ANSWER MY YES OR NO QUESTION. AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT CENTER STERN. ON DAY ONE. 30% OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE SKILLED. AND TRAINED. AND SO THAT IS THE BASIC PREMISE. OF YOUR COLLEAGUES CONCERNS OUR PREMISE IS NOT THAT THEY ALL SHOULD BE AT SOME POINT IN TIME. SKILLED AND TRAINED. MEMBERS OF THE UNION. THAT'S A HUNDRED PERCENT. THAT IS IMPORTANT I THINK TO MOST OF THEM IF NOT EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM HIGH QUALITY TRAINING HIGH QUALITY JOBS LIVING WAGES. AND RETIREMENT FOR SECURITY DOWN THE LINE. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE ANSWER I NEEDED I WILLNOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU SENATOR DODD SENATOR HUESO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND- I HAVE SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST TWO HOURS INVESTIGATING THE SPILL AND SPEAKING OF BOTH SIDES IN TERMS OF HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS ON. SAFETY ISSUES RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS DATING BACK TO- MY YEARS IN THE LOCAL CITY COUNCIL WE HAD AN INCIDENT THAT CALLED IT BECAUSE IN ELECTRIC. FUSION AND DEATH. OF A OF A PERSON USING SENDING US TRANSIT SYSTEM BECAUSE- A BUS STOP WAS BUILT WITH A DEFECT THAT CREATED. A HAZARD THAT KILLED SOMEBODY AND WE RESPONDED BY THAT. SO I WANT TO DIRECT MY COMMENTS TO THE MEMBERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON THE FENCE ON THIS AND I HAVE SOME CONCERNS BECAUSE I. INITIALLY STARTED TODAY SHARING THOSE CONCERNS AND I THOUGHT- MAYBE THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON BUT I WAS REMINDED OF ALL THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND SPECIFICALLY. MEMBERS WE'VE DONE THIS ALREADY. AND WE HAVE ALREADY VOTED ON BILLS. THAT SHARE THIS EXACT SAME LANGUAGE ONE WAS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SP FIFTY FOUR. THAT WAS A SAFETY RELATED ISSUE. IT DIDN'T APPLY TO THESE WORKERS IN PARTICULAR SO THIS BILL WOULD BASICALLY FOLD- THOSE WORKERS INTO THE SAME PROGRAM UNDER THE EXACT SAME PROCESS. THE WAY THAT BILL WAS- SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR PUT INTO OPERATION. MEMBERS NOT ONE WORKER WAS DISPLACED. NOT ONE WORKER WAS DISPLACED UNDER THAT BILL. AND IF THINGS ARE DONE. IDENTICAL TO THAT BILL WHICH I BELIEVE THEY WILL. NOT ONE WORKER WILL BE DISPLACED UNDER THE UNDER THIS BILL. SO I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO THE COMMENTS. WHEN WE SAY LET'S NOT PRETEND THE BUILDING TRADES ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS I'M ALSO WANT TO REMIND. MEMBERS OF THIS FLORIDA LET'S LET'S ALSO NOT PRETEND THAT THE STATE HASN'T BENEFITED. FROM BETTER TRAINED WORKERS FROM BETTER PAID WORKERS FROM HAVING PEOPLE ON THE JOB THAT YOU KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY'RE DOING. IN THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE THE INCIDENCE. OF- OF ACCIDENTS HAVE GONE DRASTICALLY DOWN. AND OFTENTIMES THOSE ARE BEING TOUTED AS- THE- THE RESULT OF THE INDUSTRY AND REALLY IT'S A RESULT OF BETTER TRAINING PROGRAMS SO. I WANT TO. I CAME IN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL I KNOW A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN I. HAVE DONE MY RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO MEMBERS TODAY CAST YOUR VOTE IN SUPPORT. OF SB FOUR ONE NINE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO NO ONE WILL BE DISPLACED WILL HAVE A BETTER TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND THEY'LL BE A BETTER PROCESS AND IT DOESN'T. PREVENT WORKERS THAT ARE- NONUNION ACCESS A NON UNION TRAINING PROGRAM BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THE PAST THOSE EXIST CURRENTLY. AND IF THERE ARE ANY SHORTFALLS THOSE CAN BE. A SHORT UP IN THE NEXT FEW. MONTHS AND IT DOESN'T TAKE. LONG TO- GET THESE PROGRAMS IN OPERATION BUT WE HAVE THEM ALREADY EXISTING. AND MEMBERS OF THE BILL DOESN'T NEED AMENDMENTS- IF YOU WANT INVESTIGATE SP FIFTY FOUR SENATORS IF YOU WANT INVESTIGATORS B. FIFTY FOUR IT'S THERE IF YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO THE PROCESS OF SB FIFTY FOUR. IT'S VERY TRANSPARENT NO MEMBERS. LOST THEIR JOBS IN THE COUNTRY. THE SAME PEOPLE WERE BETTER TRAINED AND ENDED UP WITH BETTER WAGES AND ISN'T THAT WE WANT WHAT WE WANT WE RUN FOR THESE OFFICES PROMISING A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. BETTER SAFETY AND IN A BETTER ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THIS BILL WILL GET US THERE I RECOMMEND I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO CENTER GROVE WE FORGET YOU ALSO MAKE SURE CENTER BASE IF YOU HAVE YOUR MICROPHONE UP. PLEASE PROCEED. HI I NEED TO TAKE MYSELF AND HOPEFULLY THE REST OF YOU BACK TO THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE BILL IT'S ABOUT SAFETY IN OUR GOOD SENATOR FROM CURRENT COUNTY GAVE A LITANY OF STATISTICS FOR THE SAFETY OF THIS INDUSTRY AS COMPARED TO MANY OTHERS I'M NOT SURE OF THE SB FIFTY FOUR AND THAT WAS CONTAINED IN THAT BILL THAT THERE WAS LIKE A REAL ISSUE WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT WERE BEING HARMED ON THAT JOB. SO THAT DOESN'T REGISTER WITH ME WHAT REGISTERS WITH ME FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE HAVE BEEN CAUGHT TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE AND DATA WITH REGARDS TO THE PANDEMIC WE ALL WANTED TO HEAR THAT WE NEEDED THAT TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE THINGS THAT WERE EING IMPOSED ON US BY THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS WERE TERRIBLE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE STATISTICS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM KERN COUNTY DID AN AMAZING JOB ON THIS FLOOR TO BRING US THE FINANCE IN THE STATISTICS OF THIRTY YEARS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN THE OIL FIELDS WITH THE LOWEST SAFETY RECORD OF ALL THE OTHER INDUSTRIES. THAT WERE COMPARABLE THAT SHOULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE WE'VE GOT A BILL HERE THAT IS A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE JOB OF THE SENATE TO CREATE PROBLEMS WHERE THEY DO NOT EXIST SO I URGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LOOK AT WHAT SHE PRESENTED AN- OUR IN THIS DISCUSSION IF THERE'S ANYTHING MISSING IT IS A TRUE ON THE BOOKS TRANSITION THAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED IT SHOULD BE PROSPECTIVE NOT RETROACTIVE SO WE'RE SAVING SEVENTY PERCENT. SOMETHING THEY DON'T NEED TO DO THE NEW WORKERS COMING OUT OF SCHOOLS COLLEGES PRISONS ALL OF THE AREAS THAT SHE MENTIONED THAT WE'RE GETTING WORKERS YES THEY MIGHT NEED SOMETHING A LITTLE HIGHER THIS IS CURRENTLY THERE BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT FOR THOSE FIELD. FOR ALL THESE YEARS AND DOING IT RIGHT. PERHAPS THEY SHOULD THE TRADE. I A NO VOTE. ON THE TRANSITION IS CLEAR. AND NOT SUBJECT TO ANY SORT OF MISINTERPRETATION WE ALL KNOW THAT THE INTENT OF THESE BILLS THAT WE PUT OFF THIS FLOOR OFTEN CHANGE WHEN THEY GET TO THE REGULATORY AGENCIES PRIOR TO NOVO. CENTER A BAIT SENATOR GROVE AND THEN SENT HER TALKING. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANTED TO DO A LITTLE CROSS DEBATE HERE AGAIN THINKS THE AUTHOR FROM LOS ANGELES FOR LISTENING AND CREATING A DEBATE- THE US- THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE. AND FRIEND THE- SANTA BARBARA I DO AGREE THAT DEBATE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE OFTEN WE PASS BILLS OFFER THIS FLOOR THAT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE BILLS I'M NOT SAYING I MEAN I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN I'M LIKE I'LL READ EVERY BILL. AND I GOT UP HERE AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT TEN DAYS TO REALIZE THAT'S COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE. SO AND I THINK THAT THE VIGOROUS DEBATE IS IMPORTANT AND IT DOES ADDRESS ISSUES I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A FEW THINGS. MY COLLEAGUE I'M FROM LOS ANGELES AND WHO I KNOW HER HEART AND PASSION. IS AN ACTIVIST FOR THE LABOR INDUSTRY HAS- BROUGHT HER HERE TO THIS SENATE. WITH A BACKGROUND THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN MINE I KNOW THAT AND WE'RE ALL. PRODUCTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENT IN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THAT WE ARE AROUND AND THE I THINK LIKE THAT SOME PEOPLE SAID WORDS MATTER IN WORDS MATTER. AT NO TIME IN ANY WAY DID I SAY THAT THESE EMPLOYEES WOULD BE FIRED THEY WILL NOT BE FIRED. THE ISSUE IS IN THE BILL ON PAGE FIVE AND IT SAYS IT STARTS ON PAGE FOUR AT THE BOTTOM LINE THIRTY EIGHT IT SAYS THAT THEY WILL BE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE WHICH MEANS A WORK FORCE THAT BOTH MEETS THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ONE. ALL WORKERS WILL EITHER BE REGISTERED APPRENTICES OR SKILLED JOURNEY PERSONS. TO AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FIRST AT LEAST 30% OF THE JOURNEY LEVEL GRADUATE SCHOOL DRESSES SECOND. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BILL IS THE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT CURRENTLY LIKE I SAID- 55% PEOPLE OF COLOR WE'RE MIXING KERN COUNTY WE HAVE BLACK BROWN TEN JABI- CAUCASIAN WE HAVE. IT WE HAVE SO MANY DIVERSE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE EMPLOYED IN THIS INDUSTRY THAT GIVES PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. I'M TALKING YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE IF YOU WERE WILLING TO SHOW UP AND LEARN THEY WILL TEACH YOU A SKILL ON A TRADE THAT YOU COULD ADVANCE. THIS BILL REQUIRES THESE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND WORKERS ON LIKE I SAID PAGE FIVE LINE ITEM ONE. ALL IT DOES IT SAY SOME IT SAYS ALL WORKERS. WILL BE APPRENTICES FOR RICHARD PRODUCER JOURNEY LEVEL THAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE TRAINING. THE TRAINING THAT'S OFFERED BY THESE UNIONS WHICH IS GOOD I HAVE FAITH ALL RIGHT AND IF SOMEBODY CAN HELP EDUCATE ME ON THIS ALSO. I HAVE DILIGENTLY RESEARCHED GOT THE DATA BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FOUND TRAINING PROGRAM THAT IS OFFERED. AND BY THE LABOR UNIONS THAT ADDRESS THE OIL INDUSTRY TRAINING PROGRAMS I FOUND ONE IT'S WITH ABC THAT WAS STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHICH IS CREATED EIGHT. A SAFE WORK FORCE BASED ON THE DATA THE LABOR STANDARDS IS SIXTY SIX THAT I. ADDRESSED EARLIER IN MY BILL I LIKE TO THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA FOR BRINGING IN A VERY VERY GOOD POINT IF THE GOVERNOR SIGNS THIS BILL AND THIS BILL PASSES. THERE IS A TRANSITION PERIOD LIKE THE AUTHOR SAID THE AUTHOR SAYS THERE'S A TRANSITION CREATED THERE IS AND IT'S IDENTIFIED ON. PAGE FIVE AS WELL SECTION. TWO EIGHT AND THEN A B. AND C. SO IT SAYS ON DATE. FIRST YOU KNOW. A FEW MONTHS FROM NOW ON JANUARY FIRST OUT OF THOSE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. SIXTY THREE HUNDRED WE'LL HAVE T GO BACK TO THE TRAINING COURSE WHAT SIXTY THREE HUNDRED. WHICH ONES. AGAIN I JUST I'M ASKING FOR A GUARANTEE I'D LIKE TO THINK MY CALLING FROM STOCKTON WHO. YOU HAVE GOT NO IDEA THE OIL INDUSTRY'S CAME AFTER YOU LIKE NO TOMORROW AND- YOU STILL LOOK. AT NOT A PUNITIVE SITUATION BUT THAT. TRUE INDIVIDUALS CALIFORNIANS BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES PEOPLE OF COLOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE VETERANS AND SECOND CANCERS. THIS INDUSTRY PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT PAINT JOB YOU TALKED ABOUT SKILLED AND TRAINED THE NUMBERS SHOW THEMSELVES ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS- WEBSITE. THIS IS ONE OF THE SAFEST INDUSTRIES OUT THERE IS NOT THE SAFEST. AND LIKE I SAID I THINK THE OIL INDUSTRY IS SEVEN. IS UNDER ATTACK IT'S EVIDENT BUT I THINK IT'S THE ONE OF THE GREATEST INDUSTRIES IN THE WORLD BECAUSE IT DOES OFFER INDIVIDUALS JOBS AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY TYPE OF SPECIAL TRAINING OR- OR I SEE SPECIAL TRAINING IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY COLLEGE DEGREE TO BE ABLE TO WORK THERE. THE SPECIAL TRAINING THEY GET IS A CRAFT TRAINING PROGRAM THAT WAS DESIGNED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX BY THE INDUSTRY- I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WHO. TO HER OWN ADMISSION IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SHUT DOWN A PARTICULAR LEASING LOS ANGELES. REALLY UNDERSTANDS THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE JOBS IN THIS INDUSTRY. AND- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA. RIGHT AGAIN MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO WAS ON THE CALL THIS MORNING. AT THE ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE IT'S AGAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT THESE PEOPLE BEING FIRED IT'S ABOUT THEM HAVING TO HAVE THE CERTIFICATION IN THE PROCESS. OF THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM. THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEN OPERATING SAFELY FOR ALL THESE YEARS- WITH THE LOWEST SAFETY INCIDENT READING THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE STATE WEBSITE. AND DON'T HAVE THAT TRAINING THEY MAKE EXCELLENT WAGES MANY OF THEM HAVE COMPANY VEHICLES MANY OF THEM HAVE A- FOUR OH ONE K. PLAN A RETIREMENT PROGRAM. SOME PEOPLE EVEN HAVE BRIAN'S IN SOMEBODY'S CONTRACTOR COMPANY OR COMPANY OR EMPLOYEE OWNED- IT'S A GREAT INDUSTRY. AGAIN THIS IS NOT AN ANTI UNION BILL THIS IS A PRO WORKER BILL. AND I EVEN REACHED OUT IN KERN COUNTY 1100% ONE HUNTER I BLEED OIL YOU KNOW- I THINK IT'S A GREAT INDUSTRY AVERAGE OUT TO ROBIN HUNTER. TO SEE IF HE WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS BILL AND SEE IF WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON SOME WAY. TO SAVE THEIR JOBS AND MAKE SURE NO ONE IS DISPLACED. IS NOT AN ANTI UNION ILL THIS IS A PRO WORKER BILL AND AGAIN AND THANK YOU FOR LET ME DO A LITTLE CROSS TO BEAR TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE. THAT WERE ADDRESSED AND I THINK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND ESPECIALLY- ALL OF THAT THE CALL IS ON THE OTHER SIDE ISLAND SENATOR BATES. I'M FROM ORANGE COUNTY THAT ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WERE- ABOUT THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE CENTER GROUP CENTER FOR TULLOW. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. COLLEAGUES I WILL KEEP IT SHORT AND SIMPLE JUST BECAUSE I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE AND I'M GONNA SAY IT AGAIN. KERN COUNTY NEEDS TO BE LEADING THE CONVERSATION ON THE TRANSITION AND WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. KERN COUNTY AND THE PEOPLE FROM COUNTY ARE NOT OPPOSED TO SKILLED AND TRAINED. AND THEY'RE ADJUSTING TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THAT THERE WILL BE A TRANSITION. SO OBVIOUSLY FROM THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD ON THE FLOOR TODAY. THIS BILL NEEDS WORK AND- UNTIL IT IS WORKED ON I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING- AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE CONVERSATIONS. THAT WE'VE HAD TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HER TADO MEMBERS SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR STERN PLEASE CLOSE. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. TRYING TO SEEK SOME CLARIFICATION FROM OUR A PARLIAMENTARIAN WHETHER WE CAN TABLE THIS DISCUSSION SO I CAN ACTUALLY TRY TO WORK- THE SOME OF THIS OUT WITH THE MEMBERS- BUT IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE TO BRING THE BILL UP FOR A VOTE NOW- HI- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL IT'LL CHANGE. FOLKS MINDS. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A- VARIETY OF PROPOSALS BEING PUT OUT THERE AND DO NOT LIKE TO AMEND THE BILL ON THE FLY- THE ONE CONCRETE THING I GUESS I WOULD OFFERS I'M WILLING- TO LOOK AT. HI A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR THAT FIRST DATE WE TALKED ABOUT. SO IF IT WOULD HELP. MEMBERS- TO PUT. AT THE TOP OF PAGE FIVE THAT THAT TRANSITION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF IT HELPS TO MOVE IT FROM- AS OF JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO AT LEAST THIRTY PERCENT. TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I HAVE AT LEAST 30% TO THE START THE STAIR STEP THEN. I'M GOING TO COMMIT TO THAT NOW AND IT WILL JUST SAY IS- THE PUT THE BILL UP AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES INITIALLY WE CAN KEEP TALKING THE DAY GOES ON IT GETS OUT THOUGH- I WILL COMMIT TO YOU ALL- TO CLARIFY IF NECESSARY IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT. NO ONE WILL BE FIRED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL THAT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT- IF THERE NEEDS TO BE RESTATED IN A LAW. ON I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR IN THE BILL BUT I I'M I'M WILLING TO. TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE- BUT WITHOUT UNDERCUTTING THE OVERALL. THE PREMISE OF THE BILL THAT THROUGH THIS TRANSITION WE DO WANT FOLKS TO GET PREVAILING WAGER TO BEAT SKILLS OR ANY PERSON OR TO BE A- DIFFERENCE. I KNOW WE BELIEVE IN THIS DEBATE AND I MEAN I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER WORK TO GET TO TODAY- BUT I WOULD JUST SAY- YOU KNOW TO. TO THE CENTER OF SANTA BARBARA'S POINT ABOUT THE BIGGER CONVERSATION. I SO APPRECIATE THE DILIGENCE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS AND THE DEATH AND I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEEN- PRETTY DEAF EARS OR WOULDN'T TAKE ANY OF THE CONCERNS OR- OR PLAYING A GAME. I JUST WISH WE WOULD TAKE CLIMATE CHANGE SERIOUSLY IN THIS CHAMBER. I WISH E WOULD HAVE THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THE INADEQUACY OF STATE LAW RIGHT NOW TO MAKE A TRANSITION THIS DECADE. NONE OF THOSE BILLS ARE MOVING. DAN CAN YOU STICK TO THE BILL IN HAND PLEASE. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I WAS REFERRING TO MY COLLEGE OF SANTA BARBARA'S COMMENTS ABOUT. THE BIGGER CONVERSATION OCCURRING HERE SO THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION AND I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW THIS DEBATE- AN ENTIRE CALIFORNIA JOBS PLAN DOES NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE AND THEN MAYBE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE ASKING FOR. IN THAT TRANSITION. WHATEVER THAT FRAMEWORK OUGHT TO BE OF A JOBS GUARANTEE THAT MAY BE BIGGER THAN THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. SO FOR THAT PIECE OF A JOBS GUARANTEE. THAT YOU WILL NEVER GET PROFESSIONAL NOT CHANGING YOU WILL FOREVER BE IN THAT LINE OF WORK. I THINK IT'S BIGGER THAN THIS BILL CAN TAKE ON. AND I THINK THAT HAS TO BE NEGOTIATED IN THE CONTEXT OF A BROADER. CALIFORNIA JOBS PLAN THAT WE JUST PASSED IMPORTANT PIECE OF YESTERDAY. FROM A CENTER CENTER FROM LOS ANGELES BUT I'M WILLING NOW TO OFFER. ONE YEAR DELAYED- TIME FRAME AND AS NECESSARY WE CAN CONTINUE. THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. HOW TO FIND SOME- SORT OF CLARIFICATION AROUND THE FIFTH THE THIS IS THIS ON A FALSE PREMISE THAT PEOPLE BE FIRED BY THE BILL I THINK YOU HEARD MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD SAY. SHE'S NOT SAYING THAT. NO ONE WILL BE FIRED BY THIS BILL IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT. SO THE EXPERT. ON THIS LEGISLATION HERE- IN OUR HOUSE HE'S SAYING IT DOESN'T DO THAT. JUST WANTS TO KNOW WHO IS THEIR JOB. SO ILL OFFER THAT IN MY CLOTHES- AND BEG FOR A- PICTURE THIS DILIGENCE- AS A BODY OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE BIG PICTURE TO.

SENATE BILL TWO THIRTEEN BY SENATOR CORTEZ HE AN ACT RELATING TO WORKERS COMPENSATION CENTER CORTESE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SIR ROSE TODAY TO PRESENT SP TWO THIRTEEN WHICH WILL CREATE A WORKERS COMPENSATION REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES. I DIRECT PATIENT CARE IN ACUTE HOSPITAL SETTINGS YOUR FACE HIGH RISK OF ILLNESS AND INJURIES SUCH AS INFECTIOUS DISEASE MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURY- POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN COLD NINETEEN- LET ME- INTERJECTED PAUSE AND SAY THAT- I HAVE- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. HI TWENTY YEARS PRIOR TO COMING HERE AND GOVERNMENT TWELVE ON THE SENECA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHICH RUNS UP ONE OF THE LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES MULTIPLE HOSPITALS. MULTIPLE CLINICS BLOCKS OF HOSPITAL WORKERS- I ALSO IN A COUNTY THAT HAS A VERY ROBUST PRIVATE SECTOR HOSPITAL SYSTEM- I BEEN AWARE BUT THERE COULD BE ISSUES OF FAIRNESS ISSUES FOR A LONG TIME INTERACTED ON THEM. IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN SOMETHING LONG AGO THAT I COMMITTED TO- WAS RIGHT WHEN I GOT HERE. TO DO WHAT I NEEDED TO DO TO BEGIN TO BRING EQUITY. TO THESE WORKERS IN A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FIELD. BUT SO I WANT TO TELL YOU- WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITY AND WHY. EXISTING LAW ONLY PROVIDES CERTAIN TYPES OF FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS. ELIGIBILITY FOR WORKER'S COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE A FORTY THESE PROTECTIONS OR PRESUMPTIONS RECRUIT EMTS PARAMEDICS FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS ALL OF WHICH BY THE WAY ARE CURRENTLY MALE DOMINATED FIELDS LET ME GIVE YOU THOSE STATISTICS. ACCORDING TO UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT POLICE OFFICERS ARE MEN. NINETEEN OUT OF TWENTY FIREFIGHTERS ARE MEN. THREE OUT OF FOUR EMTS ARE MEN. MEANWHILE FRONTLINE WORKERS WORK IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS SUCH AS NURSES THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE PANDEMIC OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. THEY'RE NOT ENTITLED TO THE SAME WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT. THAT NURSES PROTECT THE SAME POPULATION IN OUR HOSPITALS THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS PROTECT IN THE FIELD. NINE OUT OF TEN REGISTERED NURSES ARE WOMEN. THE CORE OF THIS BILL IS SIMPLE. S. P. TWO THIRTEEN RECOGNIZES AND ADDRESSES A GLARING INEQUITY IN CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. IT CORRECTS A HISTORICAL WRONG MATE DURING A VERY DIFFERENT TIME LONG AGO. EQUITY IS ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN ALL FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS WHO FACE THE SAME RISK OF ILLNESS AND INJURY TO THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK ARE GIVEN THE SAME GUARANTEED BENEFITS. HOW MANY MORE YEARS MUST PASS AND HOW MANY MORE EXCUSES MUST WE MAKE BEFORE WE DO WHAT'S RIGHT. DESPITE MY RELUCTANCE AGREED TO SCALE BACK THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL TO ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUES CONCERNED SO LET ME SAY RELUCTANT AS I MAY BE I APPRECIATE THE COOPERATION I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE THOSE. WHO COME FORWARD WITH SPECIFICS- THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DEAL WITH. WITHOUT DOING SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SIRI THE INTENT OF THE BILL SO I AGREED TO REMOVE CANCER. CPO COPD AND ASTHMA FROM THE BILL IN- THOSE WILL BE OFFERING THEMIT'S ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE BUT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT SPECIFIC CLAIMS. AND THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN WILLING TO WORK ON THE SCOPE. IN FACT 92% OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS- PROVED WITH THIS DEMOGRAPHIC. WITH THE SPILL ABOUT AGAIN IS LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. S. P. TWO THIRTEEN IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS RESOLVING THE ECONOMIC AND GENDER INEQUITY THAT PERVADES OUR SOCIETY TO STAY. ALL THREE THIS BILL HAS BEEN A FURTHER I OPENING EXPERIENCE AFTER MY TWELVE YEARS AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR WERE WITNESSED FIRST HAND FIRST HAND. IN THIS DOCUMENT RESPONDED TO MOTOR BOATS IN LETTERS AND FACE TO FACE MEETINGS. FIRSTHAND HOSPITALS UNDERCUTTING THE WORK FORCE PRETTYPROFITS OVER PEOPLE AND THE WORKERS. SO AGAIN I MADE A PROMISE TO MYSELF. TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. UPON ARRIVING HERE IN THIS WON'T BE THE LAST TIME THAT YOU HEAR ME COMING FROM A PLACE OF EQUITY AND FAIRNESS. THE GAP IN ACCESS TO WORKERS COMPENSATION EXPERIENCE POORER NURSES. IS A WRONG MUST BE CORRECTED. FOR ME TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. ANY EXCUSE TO REAL LIFE EXAMPLES. AGAIN AS I JUST STATED BASED ON LABOR STATISTICS. FIREFIGHTERS AND EMTS ARE 90% MALE. NURSES ARE THE EMERGENCY ROOM. GET HANDS OFF A PATIENT ON A GURNEY. AND HE HURTS HIS OWN. HE HAS A WORKERS COMP PRESUMPTION. RIGHT NOW. IN THAT MOMENT. WHEN HE HANDS THE PATIENT ON THE GURNEY OVER TO THE WOMAN NURSE AND SHE HURT HER ARM. IN THE SAME WAY SHE HAS NO WORKERS COMP PRESUMPTION. SAME CONTINUUM OF CARE. IT SAME ACUITY OF CARE SAME FRONTLINE STATUS. IN THAT SPLIT SECOND DURING THE HEAD OFF. THE CURRENT PRESUMPTION DISAPPEARS. WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE. I ASK AGAIN WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE. YOUR UNION ISSUES VERSUS NON ISSUES NON UNION ISSUES. IT'S ABOUT EQUITY. IN OUR HEAD. COLLEAGUES GOOD COLLEAGUES CLOSE COLLEAGUE SAID TO ME YES BUT IT WOULD SET A PRECEDENT. COLLEAGUES I DIDN'T HERE.THIS FOR THE STATUS QUO WHEN IT COMES TO-AND I DON'T THINK MOST OF YOU CAME HERE FOR THE EITHER I THINK WE'RE HERE TO SET PRECEDENT ESPECIALLY IN AN AREA LIKE THIS. AND THE PRESIDENT IN THIS CASE IS WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OVER FIFTY YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT THE WORK WOMEN DO. IS EQUAL. TO THE WORK THAT MEN DO AND SHOULD BE COMPENSATED THE SAME WAY. WORKERS COMPENSATION SHOULD FOLLOW THAT RULE EQUITY FOR ALL FRONTLINE WORKERS IN EQUITY FOR WOMEN. I EVEN HAD A CLOSE COLLEAGUE JUST LOOK AT ME AND SAY WHY. IN THE PERIPHERIES BOBBY KENNEDY. SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT THINGS AS THEY ARE AND SAY WHY I THINK WE'RE HERE. TO LOOK AT THINGS THAT NEVER WERE AND SAY WHY NOT AND I THINK THIS KIND OF EQUITY IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

THIS BILL WOULD PUT THE BURDEN ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN COMPENSATION CLAIMS RATHER THAN THE REQUIRED THE PERSON WHO'S BEEN WRONGLY CONVICTED TO PROVE. THEY ARE INNOCENT. WHY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO OBJECT TO ONLY THOSE CLAIMS IN WHICH THEY BELIEVE THE PERSON SHOULD NOT BE COMPENSATED. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MUST THEN PROVE BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE. THAT THE CLAIMANT IS NOT ENTITLED. TO COMPENSATION. IF THE AG DOES NOT TAKE UP THE CASE THE COMPENSATION CLAIMS WOULD GO FORWARD. THE CALIFORNIA VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO APPROVE THIS- THE CLAIM AMOUNT AND SEND IT TO THE LEGISLATURE FINAL APPROVAL- MANY HAVE SPENT YEARS EVEN DECADES BEHIND BARS BEFORE THERE AND CONVICTIONS HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED SINCE THAT THIS IS AN INTERESTING FACT EXTRAORDINARY FACTS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE CALIFORNIA INMATES WHO HAVE OBTAINED COURT REVERSAL OF THEIR CONVICTIONS AND HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER SPENDING YEARS FIGHTING TO PROVE THEIR WRONGFUL CONVICTION. AND DECADES UNJUSTLY BEHIND BARS. HOWEVER ONCE THESE WRONGLY CONVICTED PERSONS TO OBTAIN COURT REVERSALS THEY MUST RE LITIGATE THEIR CASE TO ENSURE THEY'RE FAIRLY FAIRLY COMPENSATED. THIS IS PROVEN TO BE AN UNFAIR AND UNJUST BURDEN ON PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY DETERMINED TO BE WRONGLY CONVICTED.

SENATE BILL EIGHT OH THREE BY SENATOR ROTH AN ACT RELATING TO PROFESSIONS AND VOCATIONS SEVERAL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES CONSIDER BELLATOR THREE IS THE SUNSET BILL FOR THE BOARD OF BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY SUNSET BILL THAT IS CURRENTLY BECAUSE A LOT OF CONSTERNATION. IN THE LEGISLATURE AND OUTSIDE. JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT MAKES VARIOUS CHANGES TO THE OPERATION OF THE BOARD AND PROVISIONS IN THE ACT STEMMING FROM OUR JOINT SUNSET REVIEW OPERATION. AND THOSE CHANGES INCLUDE MODIFYING THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD TO INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS REGULATED BY THE BOARD. UPDATING THE TRAINING PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGISTS. REMOVES THE-REQUIREMENT FOR COMPLETION OF A PRACTICAL EXAMINATION PRIOR TO LICENSURE BUT SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE WRITTEN EXAMINATION INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS WITH REGARD TO HEALTH SAFETY SANITATION AND DISINFECTION PROCEDURES PRACTICES AND LAWS. BENNETT LESLIE PLEASED IN TERMS OF THIS LIST UPDATES THE NUMBER OF MANDATORY HOURS OF TRAINING THE APPLICANT MUST COMPLETE IN ORDER TO BECOME LICENSED BY THE BOARD OF BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY. INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF SAFETY AND HEALTH CURRICULUM AN APPLICANT MUST COMPLETE FROM SIXTY FIVE HOURS OUTLINED IN THE EGULATIONS TWO ONE HALF HUNDRED HOURS SPECIFIED IN THE BILL IN ORDER TO PROTECT. LICENSEES AND CONSUMERS IN PURPLE PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY. THROUGH KNOWLEDGE IN TOPICS SUCH AS HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES CHEMICALS AND HEALTH. HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AGENCIES BACTERIOLOGICAL. AND PREVENTING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INFECTION AND SANITATION FOR EXAMPLE. TERMS OF THE GNU HOURS THE BILL REQUIRES ONE HUNDRED HOURS OF TRAINING AND DISINFECTION AND SANITATION. WHICH IS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE FROM THE TWENTY HOURS REQUIRED PRESENTLY ON THOSE PARTICULAR SUBJECTS. NOW THIS TRAINING OUR REQUIREMENT IS PROBABLY THE MOST CONTENTIOUS. IN THE BILL CURRENTLY THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR COSMETOLOGISTS AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS OF TRAINING FOR BARBERS. NOW WE ALL KNOW LICENSING AND TRAINING CAN BE A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT PARTICULARLY FOR OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED. AT THE SAME TIME I THINK ALL OF US CLEARLY RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TRAINING. TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY NOT ONLY OF THE INDIVIDUALS PROVIDING THE CARE IN THIS CASE BARBERS COSMETOLOGISTS AND ALIKE. BUT CONSUMERS. NOW IN THIS LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY. BEFORE MY TIME AND DURING MY TIME. WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS. WE'VE ASKED THE BOARD AND WE HAVE ASKED THE INDUSTRY FOR HELP. TO MY KNOWLEDGE ANYWAY THE BOARD IS NEVER EVALUATED THE ACTUAL RISKS TO THE CONSUMERS M. LICENSEES. EVALUATED WHERE SPECIFIC HARM ARISES IN JUSTIFYING THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOUR TRAINING REQUIREMENT FOR COSMETOLOGISTS AND THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED REQUIRED OUR REQUIREMENT FOR BARBERS YES. THE STANDARD CONTINUES TO EXIST TODAY DESPITE SEVERAL REQUESTS BY MY PREDECESSORS AND BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. FOR AN EVALUATION AND HELP IN EVALUATING THESE STANDARDS SO. IN THIS BILL WE SET THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ONE THOUSAND HOURS FOR BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGISTS IN AS I INDICATED PREVIOUSLY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED REQUIREMENTS IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH SAFETY DISINFECTION AND SANITATION WHEN WE SET THIS ONE THOUSAND R. REQUIREMENTS BASED ON INPUT FROM THE BOARD NOW. AND OUR EXAMINATION OF CHANGES MADE IN SEVERAL OTHER STATES IN THIS NATION FOR THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED. AMAT IN TEXAS DOWN TO ONE THOUSAND HOURS RHODE ISLAND DOWN TO SIX HUNDRED HOURS NEW YORK AND OTHERS CONTINUING. UNFORTUNATELY DURING THE HEARING THAT WE CONDUCTED AND I JUST HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHAIRING. WE HAD VERY LITTLE INPUT FROM INDUSTRY DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I SAY UNFORTUNATELY. OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO GET THIS THING RIGHT WE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE RIGHT REASONS PARTICULARLY IN THIS AREA. ENCOURAGING UPWARD MOBILITY FOR ALL. WELL WE ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE FULLY TOTALLY. PROTECTED WE WILL CONTINUE TO GET THIS THING RIGHT AS YOU KNOW WITH THIS SUNSET BILL IS WITH ALL OF THE OTHERS WE HAVE CONSIDERED AND WILL CONSIDER- IN THIS HOUSE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS IT'S A JOINT PROCESS WITH THE ASSEMBLY THE BILL WILL CLEARLY CONTINUE TO TAKE SHAPE THROUGHOUT THE NEXT NUMBER OF MONTHS IN THE FEEDBACK FROM OUR VALUABLE INDUSTRY PARTNERS. WHO HAVE SPENT YEARS HONING THEIR SKILLS WILL BE KEY AND THAT INCLUDES THE SCHOOLS WILL BE KEY TO DETERMINING THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION FOR THE BOARD OF BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY IN THE FUTURE AND THE STATE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE IMPOSE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND LISTENING TO ME AND HAT THE PROPRIOCEPTIVE RICK RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SO I'M I'M STANDING TODAY TOO AND I'M GOING TO BE- LAYING OFF AS P. EIGHT OH THREE- THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MY APOLOGIES. TO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM RIVERSIDE WHO I THINK IS AN EXCELLENT COMMITTEE CHAIR THERE'S BEEN SOME- LATE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AGAIN THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL HAS SAID THAT HE WILL WORK WITH HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE IS MENTIONING IT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT- WHEN YOU THINK OF ICONIC COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA YOU THINK OF YOU KNOW WALT DISNEY COMPANY. H. P. M. T. N. AND WHEN YOU THINK OF. PRODUCTS YOU THINK A PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS. WHICH WAS A CALIFORNIA COMPANY WHEN PAUL MITCHELL AND JOHN PAUL DEJORIA WHO STARTED THE COMPANY JOHN PAUL WAS LIVING IN HIS CAR THEY HAD TO BORROW SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO START THE COMPANY. TODAY THEIR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN EIGHTY EIGHT COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE. IN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THEY STARTED- COSMETOLOGY SCHOOLS CURRENTLY THEY HAVE A HUNDRED AND SEVEN SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY JUST RECENTLY OPENED ONE IN EUROPE IN CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE SCHOOLS IN PLEASANT HILL MODESTO FRESNO TWO IN SACRAMENTO SAN FRANCISCO TRUCKEE SAN JOSE. PASADENA TO MACULA SANDIEGO COSTA MESA IN SHERMAN OAKS. DAN WHAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL IS AND AGAIN IT'S ALL AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT'S ARBITRARY IS AT SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS NOW THIS FEEL WANT TO TAKE IT DOWN TWO. THOUSAND ONLY THREE STATES THAT ARE A THOUSAND ONE OF THOSE TAXES. AND WE DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF FALLING TEXAS WE WANT TEXAS TO FOLLOW US. IT WAS A CHALLENGE WITH THAT IF YOU DO LEAVE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE LEADING WE HAD A- COLLEAGUE FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MET THAT EARLIER THIS WEEK. AND YOU GO TO ANOTHER STATE IF WE WERE A THOUSAND YOU WENT TO ANOTHER STATE. YOU COULD NOT START WORKING IMMEDIATELY YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO AND MAKE UP MAKE UP THOSE HOURS. AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT WORKS. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE SO MANY HOURS AT LEAST ON THE ON THE PAUL MITCHELL SCHOOLS. BECAUSE NOT ONLY HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH IS QARAMADA SLEEP AFTER WHAT WE'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH. AND OBVIOUSLY CUTTING HERE CONFIDENTLY. BUT ALSO BUSINESS. YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING THING WHICH I DIDN'T LEARN UNTIL THIS WEEK. IS THAT ONLY GOT EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT. OF HAIR STYLIST. WORKING THOSE BIG BOX. WHERE THEIR THEIR STANDPOINT YOU'RE MENTALLY RELATIONSHIP. A NINETY ONE POINT 5% ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTREPRENEURS. THEY GO OUT IN THE V. RENT A BOOTH AND THEY CONDUCT THEIR OWN BUSINESS WHY DO THEY WANT INDEPENDENCE. MAYBE THEIR THEIR MOMS. AND THEY- THEY WANT THAT THEY WANT THE FLEXIBILITY SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE NOT SENDING THESE PEOPLE TO THE WALLS THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE SKILL SET NEEDED- TO BE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND THRIVE- ONCE THEY GO OUT INTO THE WORK FORCE. SO I'M REALLY CONFIDENT. WITH OUR THROUGH THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND THE SWEET SWEET SPOT BETWEEN EFFICIENCY OF THE PROGRAM. AND GETTING PEOPLE LICENSE IN A IN A TIMELY MANNER AND ALSO THAT THEY HAVE THE EDUCATIONAL- BACKGROUND NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT I'M I'M LAYING OFF TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. AS WE MOVE THIS TO THE NEXT HOUSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WILK FURTHER AWAY SO. WHAT ABOUT. YOU WERE NO HE DID NOT SPEAK. I'M SORRY I WAS TOLD YOU WANTED TO SPEAK CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'LL TAKE CENTRE WASTE OF TIME- AND- WHAT WHILE I WON'T STAND UP HERE IN A- HAVE A COMMERCIAL FOR AN EMPLOYER IN MY DISTRICT- I DO. HI I DO WANT TO I SUPPORTED THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE- I SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I SUPPORT THE REDUCTION IN LICENSURE HOURS- IN TRAINING- FOR BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGISTS TO ACQUIRE THEIR LICENSE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK ME TO LEAVE AND I GOT MY HAIR CUT LAST WEEK BUT I JUST HAD THE BARBER TAKE A LITTLE BIT OFF- CAN I TALK TO ME. IN THE BUSINESS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND I AND I KNEW THIS WAS COMING UP IN. HIS NAME'S CAPTAIN MIKE IS A CAPTAIN MICHAEL WE DON'T WHEN YOU GOT YOUR LICENSE. HOW MANY HOURS DID IT TAKE TO GET YOUR LICENSE I. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY HE SAID TWO HUNDRED HOURS. AND SO OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS GROWN OVER THE YOU KNOW THE DECADES OF TIME- FOR FOLKS TO GET TRAINED ON THEIR LICENSING BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS- TO BECOME A LICENSED BARBER CONVENT COSMETOLOGISTS IN CALIFORNIA THESE ARE ALL. VERY IS THAT THEY'RE ALL PROFESSIONALS THEY'LL TAKE THEIR JOB VERY SERIOUS. BUT THAT'S A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO INVEST. TO BECOME LICENSED IN THIS PROFESSION AND SO AS THIS BILL PROCEEDS AND THERE'S CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO AMEND IT AND CHANGE IT- I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE WORKING TOWARD REDUCING THE NUMBER OF. HOURS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN LOWER THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY INTO THIS PROFESSION FOR THE MANY CALIFORNIANS THAT WANT TO TAKE THIS PROFESSION SERIOUS AND GET TO WORK EARNING A LIVING SO THAT THEY CAN STAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR JONES CENTRE ALAN AND THEN SENATOR GLAZER. MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I THINK THIS IS GOING TO. IMPROVE ACCESS AND I ALSO VERY MUCH TRUST THE AUTHOR- TO STEER THIS BILL FORWARD IN IN A IN A IN A FAIR MANNER. I JUST WANT I DO WANT TO I WANT TO. JUST BRING UP ONE ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH MY FRIEND CENTER FROM FROM LOS ANGELES CENTER. COM LOGGER. AND THIS IS THE ISSUE YOU KNOW AS OUR AS OUR C. BECOMES MORE MORE DIVERSE. IT IS IMPORTANT IT IS SO IMPORTANT. THAT THOSE FOLKS WORKING BARBER IN COSMETOLOGY REALLY LEARN. THE SPECIAL SKILLS AND TRAITS. ASSOCIATED WITH- WORKING WITH PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS. YOUR COLLEAGUE OUR GOOD FRIEND SENATOR MITCHELL FOR EXAMPLE pAGO. THAT THAT DEALT WITH ISSUES RELATING TO DISCRIMINATION FOR FOLKS- FOR BLACK FOLKS IN TERMS OF HAIRSTYLES IN IN ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT. I'D CENTER AND I WERE JUST DISCUSSING WAS THE LACK OF TRAINING AMONGST A LOT OF FOLKS IN THE- BARBERING WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO WORKING WITH BLACK HAIR. HI THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I YOU KNOW IT'S IT AND IT'S I MEAN I I'VE- THE FUNNY THING TO SAY BUT I SPENT A SUMMER. LIVING WORKING IN AFRICA. AND HOW I WENT IN TO GET MY HAIR CUT. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HAIR. AND- AND I WAS A REALLY SCARY EXPERIENCE AND- AND I GOTTA TELL YOU I JUST LISTED IS THAT A VERY LITTLE BIT NAG I KIND OF GOT OUT OF THERE AND IT REALLY GOT ME THINKING TO MYSELF WHEN WHAT IS IT LIKE- YOU KNOW IF YOU. IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE LIVING IN A COMMUNITY WHERE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK LIKE YOU. ARE ALL THE AMENITIES IN THE SERVICES ARE NOT GEARED IN PARTICULAR TOWARDS ADDRESSING YOUR NEEDS. OUR SOCIETY IS BECOMING MORE MORE DIVERSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT. THAT FOLKS IN THE BARBERING WORLD ARE ABLE TO WORK WITH ALL CALIFORNIANS- AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR TO COMMIT. TO TO ENSURING THAT THAT ISSUE CONTINUES TO BE ADDRESSED. HI AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND WITH THAT I BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT HIM THAT I SEEM TO HEAR YOU WANT TO GIVE. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND SUPPORT HIS EFFORTS. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS AND I'M CERTAINLY STANDING IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT OH THREE. HI DO WE CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUE- THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE TO- IT VANCE'S GOOD WORK TO TRY TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE- HEALTH AND SAFETY AND TRAINING. I WOULD NOTE THAT. TO BE A POLICE OFFICER IN GENERAL IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRES A HUNDRED HOURS OF. TRAINING EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND COMPARE THT TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS- TO- TO CUT YOUR HAIR. SO SOMETHING'S OUT OF WHACK. I WANT TO SAY TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO- APPRECIATE HIS REMARKS ON THE FLOOR. AND HEARING THE STORIES- OF HIS OWN BARBER THE ONLY. HAVING TO HAVE TWO HUNDRED HOURS. NOW SOME MIGHT SUGGEST THAT THAT. EFFECT OF THOSE TWO I HOURS. MAY AND- THAT. MAYBE COULD USE A LITTLE BIT MORE TRAINING THAN THAT. BUT WE'LL PUT THAT ASIDE I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HOPE THAT THIS SENATOR WILL CONTINUE TO GO TO WORK ON ALL THE ISSUES AND MAKE THIS A MORE BALANCED PROCESS FOR. BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGISTS. WHO WANNA GET INTO THAT PROFESSION IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER CENTER MELINDA'S.

THANK YOU TO MY EXTRAORDINARY HARD WORKING CHIEF OF STAFF FOR A CONTAINER WHO WORKED THIS CASE GOES OUT ON THIS MEASURE OVER THE LAST MANY MONTHS. DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT- IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP NINETEEN PASSED BY THE VOTERS. THE WE WORK WITH THE ASSESSORS TO SOLVE THAT ISSUE WE GIVE AN EMERGENCY AUTHORITY TO THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION TO WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT THE VOTERS SAID. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY WE KEPT OUR WORD. WITH RESPECT TO THE MEETING IMPLEMENTATION AND INTENT OF THIS MEASURE WITH RESPECT TO. THE PROP NINETEEN RESPECT TO THE VOTERS AND THE VOTE LAST YEAR ON THIS FLOOR WELL THANK THE FIREFIGHTERS AND REALTORS FOR EXTRAORDINARY WORK ON THIS. I THINK IT COULD BE IMPORTANT MEASURE AND WITH THAT. ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG MEMBERS DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I RECENTLY MET WITH THE GOOD SENATOR FROM HEALDSBURG AND THE SENATOR FROM SAN FERNANDO VALLEY TO DISCUSS. PROPOSITION NINETEEN AND MORE SPECIFICALLY MIGHT BE O. S. V. SIX SIX EIGHT WHICH WOULD HAVE DELAYED THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF PROP NINETEEN FOM FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. A MERE TWO AND A HALF MONTHS AFTER IT WAS ODD- BY THE VOTERS TO FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE DELAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION LAWYERS COUNTY ASSESSORS AND TAXPAYERS MORE TIME TO FIGURE OUT. HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT THE LARGEST CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM SINCE PROP THIRTEEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT UNFORTUNATELY WERE NOT ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT AND HAVE MY DEAL INCORPORATED INTO THE BILL WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY. I THANK THE SENATORS SAW SPECIALLY- TAKEN OUT TIME BRINGING US. TO THE TABLE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS ON THIS ISSUE. HOWEVER I WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE TODAY BECAUSE OUR COUNTY ASSESSORS ARE DESPERATE FOR ANY CLARIFICATION. ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT PROPOSITION NINETEEN I STOOD ON THIS FLOOR LAST JUNE AND RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT ACA ELEVEN WHICH BECAME PROP NINETEEN ON THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY VALID. THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION SENT A LETTER WITH TWO PAGES OF CONCERNS AND COUNTY ASSESSORS. ARE WARNED OF THE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE REST AC ELEVEN FAMILIES HAVE BEEN HURT AND THE PROSPECT FOR BUILDING INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH THROUGH PROPERTY OWNERSHIP. FOR MANY HAS BEEN DIMINISHED. THE COLD AT NINETEEN. HAS LEFT PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS UNABLE TO MAKE TRANSFERS UNDER THE OLD% RULES DUE TO GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS BEING CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. THE NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS NOT ONLY FROM MY DISTRICT BUT FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA HAVE REACHED OUT TO MY OFFICE. HEARING THEIR HORROR STORIES REVOLVING AROUND PROP NINETEEN IN TE RUSH TO GET PROPOSITION NINETEEN WE DIDN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH TIME. FOR TAX ASSESSORS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR FAMILIES TO PLAN HOW TO IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES TO PROTECT BEARS AND THEIR FUTURE GENERATIONS PROPERTY. RULE THAT FAMILIES COUNTED ON FOR NEARLY FIVE DECADES WENT OUT THE WINDOW. WE COULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER S. B. FIVE THIRTY NINE DOES MAKE AN ATTEMPT AT RECTIFYING THE WRONGS AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT IT BUT WE ARE STILL FEELING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES BY NOT DOING MORE. WHICH WE REALLY NEED TO DO. SENATOR ALI. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE AND I WANT TO FIRST OFF- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MANY HOURS- ON ZOOM- WORKING WITH THE ASSESSOR'S A CALIFORNIA THE ASSOCIATION WHO WE THIS THIS BILL BASICALLY GIVES CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO THE ASSESSORS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS IN PRAGUE NINETY AND HOW IT SHOULD BE- HOW THE THIS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. SO I WOULD SHARE THAT- THERE'S LANGUAGE AND- FIVE NINETEEN THAT ALLOWS A FAMILY FARMS TO CONTINUE TO BE FAMILY FARMS THIS BILL- CLARIFIES HOW THOSE FAMILY FARMS WILL BE ASSESSED TO THE ASSESSORS AND HOW THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH MANY OTHER ASPECTS- PROP NINETEEN THAT WERE PASSED DO SOME SURRENDER THIS BILL HERE- I SUPPORT THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- AND THE ASSOCIATIONS THAT WE WORKED WITH. TIRES THE FIREFIGHTERS THE REALTORS AND THE LIKES OF- THIS BILL IS ABOUT- KEEPING YOUR WORD AND MAKING SURE THAT THE LEGISLATION OR THE VALIDATION THAT WAS PASSED IS IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY SO FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE STANDARDS FOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU COUPLE POINTS FIRST ON WITH RESPECT DELAY OF IMPLEMENTATION DATE WE LOOKED AT THAT BUT IT'S OUR VIEW THAT THE VOTERS SPOKE AND THIS IS WHAT THEY PUT IN AND WE WERE STILL WE WERE BASICALLY GUIDED BY THE VOTERS YOU COULD ARGUE THAT. ANY WAY YOU CHOOSE THE CLARIFICATION LANGUAGE WE FELT WE HAD FLEXIBILITY. AS WAS APPROPRIATELY EXPRESSED. BOTH ELEMENTS OF THIS MEASURE ON THE FLOOR. LAST SESSION WE CENTER HILL INSERT SYNAGOGUES. AND ALSO THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THIS VERY SAME THING A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. THE ARGUMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE LAST MINUTE ISSUE THAT I'VE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF FOLKS IN MY JUDGMENT. IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS A VALID A POINT OF VIEW. AND THE ISSUE WITH THE FAMILY FARMS WAS A CLARIFICATION APPROPRIATELY ALTHOUGH THE FARM BUREAU DIDN'T SUPPORT PROP NIGHT. AC ELEVEN. WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR BUT THEN CHANGED IT WHEN IT WAS PROP NINETEEN BUT THE CLARIFICATION WAS APPROPRIATE. AND I GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THAT. AND THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I. NEEDED THIS BILL LIKE A LOCKING CLIP.

CASKEY I WINNER I WILL I. PLEASE CALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS ROSE HI JONES NIELSEN. FIVE THIRTY EIGHT MILLER ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS MOVING ON THE FILE ITEM FIFTY ONE SENATOR ROTH MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL EIGHT OH SIX BY SENATOR ROTH AN ACT RELATING TO HEALING ARTS CENTER ALL THINK ABOUT PRESIDENT CALLING SENATE BILL EIGHT ZERO SIX IS THE SUNSET BILL FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT THIS BILL IN A SUNSET EXTENSION THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WILL EXPIRE. SO THE BILL EXTENDS BOARD OPERATIONS FOR TWO YEARS. THE MEDICAL BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT PROCESS STARTING WITH HOW COMPLAINTS FROM THE PUBLIC OR HANDLED STRETCHING ALL THE WAY TO THE END IS THE BOARD MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT LICENSE DISCIPLINE. HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND QUESTIONS FROM YOU. AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ALIKE. IN THAT REGARD SIGNIFICANTLY THE BILL PROPOSES AN ENFORCEMENT MONITOR AT THE MEDICAL BOARD TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE INDEPENDENT INFORMATION. ABOUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AT THE MEDICAL BOARD INFORMATION THAT I HOPE. WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE AS TO THE NEXT NECESSARY STEPS TO SUPPORT THE MEDICAL BOARD'S IMPORTANT WORK. THE MEASURE ALSO REINSTATES THE MEDICAL BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO RECOVER COSTS INCURRED. DURING DISAPPOINT ENFORCEMENT CASES. THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF FOR MULTIPLE SUNSET REVIEWS AND IT IS LIKELY TO PROVIDE AT LEAST SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO OFFSET COSTLY. BUT NECESSARY DISCIPLINARY ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE FEE INCREASE PROPOSED BY THE BOARD AND ADMINISTRATION. FEEDING FREEZE IN SOME AMOUNT IS CLEARLY NECESSARY NOW THIS IS BEEN A VERY CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION AS I KNOW EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU ARE AWARE FROM THE PHONE CALLS EMAILS AND TEXT THAT YOU'VE BEEN RECEIVING DURING THE SUNSET. REVIEW PERIOD FRANKLY THE MEDICAL BOARD IS BORDERING ON THE INSOLVENT AND HAS NOT HAD AN ADJUSTMENT TO FEE INCREASES AN ADJUSTMENT OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT PORT OPERATIONS FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS. THE MEDICAL BOARD IS REQUIRED TO HAVE A RESERVE ACCOUNT EQUAL TO TWO TO FOUR MONTHS OF EXPENSES IN CONTRAST TO THIS REQUIREMENT THE MEDICAL BOARDRESERVE ACCOUNT WILL SOON BE DOWN TWO POINT SEVEN MONTHS POINT SEVEN MONTHS. THE ADMINISTRATION THE UPON THE BOARD ORIGINALLY PROPOSED A FEE INCREASE EQUAL TO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS EVERY TWO YEARS THE PHYSICIAN GROUPS SUBJECT TO THE FEE INCREASE QUESTIONED THE FINANCIAL AND EXPENSE ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH THE FEE PROPOSAL WAS BASED AND REQUESTED INSTEAD BUT THE INCREASE OF EIGHTY DOLLARS EVERY TWO YEARS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE. IN REVIEWING THE FEE INCREASE ISSUE IT APPEARED. AND APPEARS THAT A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A FEE INCREASE AT EITHER LEVEL BUT CLEARLY IF THE INCREASE IS REQUIRED. SO THE BILL AS AMENDED INCREASES FEES FOR PHYSICIANS EIGHTY DOLLARS EVERY TWO YEARS AND PROVIDES IT AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THE SUNSET PERIOD. THE LEGISLATURE SHALL REVISIT THE V. ISSUE REVIEW BOARD FINANCIAL DATA AND FURTHER INCREASE FEES AS APPROPRIATE AND AS NECESSARY. TO RESTORE THE FINANCIAL SOLVENCY OF THE BOARD AND ITS RESERVE ACCOUNTS TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL. THE BILL ALSO UPDATES REQUIREMENTS FOR POSTGRADUATE TRAINING PROBATION SURE BY ACCOMMODATING RESIDENTS WHO MAY TAKE LEAVE DURING THEIR POST GRADUATE PROGRAM ENROLLMENT. PROVIDING THE BOARD DISCRETION TO APPROVE APPLICATIONS AND AUTHORIZING RESIDENCY PROGRAM DIRECTORS TO VERIFY THAT APPLICANTS SUBMIT NECESSARY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. AFTER TAKING SUCH LEAVE LIKE ALL SUNSET BILLS THIS MEASURE WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE SHAPE OVER THE NEXT NUMBER OF MONTHS. AS I DISCUSSED WITH SOME OF YOU THERE ARE FURTHER AMENDMENTS THATWE WILL NEED TO PURSUE IN THE ASSEMBLY INCLUDING. LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE ACCREDITATION OF TEACHING HOSPITALS WERE PHYSICIANS PRACTICE UNDER SPECIALTY SPECIAL FACULTY PERMITS. OUR GOAL IS TO SEND THE BILL TO THE GOVERNOR THE PROVIDES THE MEDICAL BOARD WITH THE TOOLS AND DIRECTION TO ENSURE SWIFT OUTCOMES FOR CASES. MOST ESPECIALLY CASES INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION FROM THE STANDARD OF CARE THAT RESULTED IN PATIENT HARM. THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AS YOU KNOW IS JUST THAT IT'S A PROCESS AND IF THIS BILL PASSES OUT OF THIS HOUSE. THE BILL MOVES TO THE ASSEMBLY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD WITH PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS. AND WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGES WERE NECESSARY AND TO MAKE THIS THE BEST SUNSET REVIEW BILL POSSIBLE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS- I DO RISE IN SUPPORT OF- SBA TO SEX AND APPRECIATE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM RIVERSIDE FOR HIS WORK ON ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL- FULL DISCLOSURE I AM A LICENSEE OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA- A PRECIADO. THE CHALLENGES THAT- THAT THE AUTHOR IN THE- BNP COMMITTEE- FACE IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE FISCAL. STATUS OF- THE MEDICAL BOARD. OBVIOUSLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I SHARE- THE AUTHORS GOAL THAT WE NEED TO HAVE FISCAL SOLVENCY FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD. BUT I ALSO POINT OUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S SAT ON THE COMMITTEE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A MUCH CLOSER EXAMINATION OF THE COSTS. THAT ARE BEING DRIVEN- THAT THAT LEADING TO THE FISCAL INSOLVENCY ISSUES- AND FOR EXAMPLE- ELSE ESSENTIALLY A- OVERLY EXPENSIVE COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT WAS USED NOT JUST THE MEDICAL BOARD ACROSS THE CA. ELEVATED AND INTO ME EXCESSIVE LEGAL FEES BEING CHARGED TWO BOARDS- FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTION ACTIVITIES- AND OTHERS AS WELL- BECAUSE AFTER ALL- LATENCIES WEATHERED THE MEDICAL BOARD OR OTHER. HEALTH PROFESSIONS THAT ARE LICENSED AS A CITY CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW THESE THESE FEES- THEY YOU KNOW- AND NOT IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A FREE TICKET DATES HERE- AND SOMETIMES THERE'S THAT THERE'S BEEN A FEELING THAT- WELL. WE CAN JUST JACK UP FEES- TO DEAN'S EXPENSES AND THEN SAY URN AROUND SAY WE NOW NEED TO INCREASE THE FEES TO COVER THOSE EXPENSES SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLOSE ACCOUNTING. OF WHAT THE REAL EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO THE ADD TO THE WORK OF THE BOARD ITSELF AND ITS ENFORCEMENT AND SO FORTH. A GREAT AGAIN AGREED WITH THE GOAL OF- OF A SOLVENCY BUT- WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE TRYING TO LOOK AT HOW WE MINIMISE COSTS. IN THE DEPARTMENT AND IN THE BOARDS SO THAT WE'RE NOT CHARGING EXCESSIVE FEES AFTER ALL JUST LAST YEAR WE WE'VE DRASTICALLY RAISE FEES ON MANY DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS LICENSEES- AS AS WELL- SO AGAIN I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK OF- MY- GOOD FRIEND FROM RIVERSIDE AND I KNOW HE IS- WORKING HARD TO ADDRESS THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES AND- ALSO APPRECIATE HIS COMMITMENT ALSO DRESS A POLICY ISSUE THAT WAS UP FROM LAST YEAR- IT'S ADDRESSING THE APPOINTMENT. OF- OF- FACULTY- ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS THAT- WHO CAN THEN PRACTICE WITHOUT A LICENSE THAT THOSE IMPORTANTISSUE TO TRY TO RESOLVE- BUT I DO ASK THAT WE HAVE AND I VOTE ON THIS BILL SO WE CAN CONTINUE THE WORK- MOVING FORWARD- AND RENEW THE MEDICAL BOARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. MEMBER ANY FURTHER. OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NINE CENTER OFFERS LIKE TO CLOSE FOR A MINUTE PRESENT JUST WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE- THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO. AND I CONCURRED CLEARLY OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE FINANCIAL FINANCIAL SOLVENCY OF THE BOARD WHILE ENSURING. COST EFFICIENCY OF THE BOARD OPERATIONS.
