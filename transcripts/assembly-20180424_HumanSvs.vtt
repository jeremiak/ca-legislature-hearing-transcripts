THERE'S NO WAY. AN ORGANIZATION

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:25.002 region:rollup2
WOULD SEND

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.403 region:rollup2
A STAFF PERSON OUT WITHOUT

NOT WANT TO SEE IT CIRCULATING

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:43.420 region:rollup2
IN A WHERE WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:50.761 region:rollup2

ORGANIZATION WE SEE NO

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:54.898 region:rollup2
COMPELLING REASON TO DO THIS.

00:53:54.098 --> 00:53:57.000 region:rollup2

00:59:08.178 --> 00:59:10.580 region:rollup2
WITH THE WORKERS WELL BEING AND

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:13.216 region:rollup2
MIND.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.851 region:rollup2
AND THE REALITY IS THAT FOR

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:16.787 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE COMPANIES ARE THOSE

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:18.021 region:rollup2
THAT THAT HAVE CONCERNS IF

00:59:16.787 --> 00:59:19.389 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TREATING THEIR WORKERS

00:59:18.021 --> 00:59:21.258 region:rollup2
WELL PAIN THE MILE THAT THERE.

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:22.059 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE MAKING SURE THEY'RE

00:59:21.258 --> 00:59:23.527 region:rollup2
PROPERLY TRAINED.

00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:25.462 region:rollup2
THERE'S NINE ISSUE REALLY THIS

00:59:23.527 --> 00:59:27.097 region:rollup2
IS TARGETING THOSE COMPANIES OR

00:59:25.462 --> 00:59:28.799 region:rollup2
THOSE INDIVIDUAL WORKERS WERE A

00:59:27.097 --> 00:59:31.234 region:rollup2
VICTIM OF COMPANIES THAT ARE OF

00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:33.270 region:rollup2
THAT ARE.

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:34.304 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEE WAGE THEFT OF OR IS

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:36.406 region:rollup2
NOT NOT PROVIDING SAFE

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:36.940 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THERE'S THE

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:38.108 region:rollup2
ABILITY OTHER HAS A LOT OF

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:40.744 region:rollup2
ISOLATION.

00:59:38.108 --> 00:59:41.211 region:rollup2
AND SO. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS

00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:43.213 region:rollup2
REALLY TO PROVIDE THE

00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:44.981 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKERS TO BE

00:59:43.213 --> 00:59:47.417 region:rollup2
ABLE TO NOT ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:50.353 region:rollup2
ANY BUT TO BE REPRESENTED. I YOU

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:51.721 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S I THINK SOMETIMES.

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:53.056 region:rollup2
WAIT WE'D.

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:54.658 region:rollup2
I PRESUME THAT IT'S A IT'S AN

00:59:53.056 --> 00:59:56.660 region:rollup2
EASY TASK

00:59:54.658 --> 00:59:58.228 region:rollup2
FOR UP LABOR ANY OTHER

00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.696 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION JUST TO GO IN AND

00:59:58.228 --> 01:00:00.964 region:rollup2
ORGANIZE A REALITY IS THAT THESE

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:04.901 region:rollup2
WORKERS THAT.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:06.570 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S SHOWN ARE NOT ONLY IS

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:08.238 region:rollup2
THERE RAMPANT WAGE THEFT AND

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:10.140 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY BUT THERE'S ALL THEIR

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:11.341 region:rollup2
ALSO A NUMBER OF COMPANIES I

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.076 region:rollup2
DON'T DO ADEQUATE TRAINING EVEN

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:13.810 region:rollup2
IF THEY DO THE FIVE. HOURS A

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:16.079 region:rollup2
MINIMUM.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:17.614 region:rollup2
WHEN SO.

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:20.016 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.817 region:rollup2
ORDER TO ENSURE UPS AND THAT'S

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:22.385 region:rollup2
ALMOST ONE TO KEEP MY ONE A

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:23.854 region:rollup2
PREFACE THIS BY TWO THINGS ONE

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:25.255 region:rollup2
IS. THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:27.524 region:rollup2
BROADER THAN JUST LABOR

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:28.658 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS HAD MORE OR ANY

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:30.594 region:rollup2
WILL USE THAT TO TRAINING.

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:31.495 region:rollup2
ALLEGE COUNCIL AYE ADVISE THAT

01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:33.463 region:rollup2
WE KNOW IT.

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:35.165 region:rollup2
THE AND WE TOOK SUGGESTIONS

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:36.933 region:rollup2
BOTH FROM LEDGE COUNCIL AS WELL

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:37.501 region:rollup2
AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HOLDERS

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:39.402 region:rollup2
AND OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

01:00:37.501 --> 01:00:41.505 region:rollup2
OTHERS OF COLLEAGUES OF MINE. TO

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:42.639 region:rollup2
NARROW IT OF THE GOVERNOR VETOED

01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:44.007 region:rollup2
IT BE VETOED IT BECAUSE IT WAS

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.976 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVE AND NOT A

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:48.044 region:rollup2
PROSPECTIVE AYE IT'LL CLINTON'S

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:49.679 region:rollup2
WE'VE CHANGED THE BILL. TO MAKE

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:51.148 region:rollup2
IT PERSPECTIVE GAVE IT PASSED TO

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:53.650 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE LAST

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:54.818 region:rollup2
YEAR BEFORE THOSE CHANGES AND

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:57.787 region:rollup2
I'M HOPING THAT THESE CHANGES

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:59.155 region:rollup2
BLOW UP ALLOW THE GOVERNOR TO

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:01.324 region:rollup2
FOR THE KINDLY UPON.

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:04.628 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AREA THAT I AM REALLY

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:08.498 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS IS SO.

EVERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE THEY DO

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:59.582 region:rollup2

WOULD I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:37.900 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON. WHAT THE REAL ISSUE IS

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:39.268 region:rollup2
AT HAND IS THAT THAT WE HAVE A

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.903 region:rollup2
LOT OF FOLKS WILL HUNGRY? O.

01:20:39.268 --> 01:20:41.970 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES AS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:43.072 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO PUT A LOT OF

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.506 region:rollup2
STIPULATIONS ON THINGS THAT MAKE

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:46.508 region:rollup2
IT SO COMPLICATED. THAT WE

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:47.643 region:rollup2

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:49.078 region:rollup2
I'VE TOLD SOME STUDENTS

HUNGER BILLS WE DONNA CAMPUSES.

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:53.248 region:rollup2
THAT WAS KIND OF GLAD THAT THE

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.850 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DID NOT TAKE UP THE

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:56.652 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF REGULATING THEIR FOOD

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.853 region:rollup2
BANKS AND THEIR THEIR PANTRIES

01:20:56.652 --> 01:20:59.521 region:rollup2
IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:01.323 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF SO THAT PROBABLY NO

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:02.858 region:rollup2
ONE WOULD EVER GET FOOD. OF BUT

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.926 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS HAVE THE KIND OF

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:05.794 region:rollup2
HEART THAT NOBODY WANTS TO

01:21:03.926 --> 01:21:07.162 region:rollup2
REALLY ASK FOR FOOD NO ONE WANTS

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:09.031 region:rollup2
TO BE AN ASSISTANCE. THEY ALL

01:21:07.162 --> 01:21:09.998 region:rollup2

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.433 region:rollup2
I'M HUNGRY THEY COME TO BELIEVE

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:12.301 region:rollup2
THEM WE'RE GONNA DEVELOP A

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:13.669 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SYSTEM THOUGH THAT

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:15.104 region:rollup2

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:16.839 region:rollup2
THEY COULD LOOK AT. THE ISSUE OF

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:18.273 region:rollup2
HUNGER IN A PERSON'S LIFE AND

01:21:16.839 --> 01:21:21.944 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAS BECOME

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:22.544 region:rollup2
AN IMPEDIMENT TO IT BUT I THINK

01:21:21.944 --> 01:21:23.045 region:rollup2

THE BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL CARE
