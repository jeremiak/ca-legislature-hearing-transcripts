INCREASE IN BASE FUNDING IS

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:36.685
GREAT. BUT WE NEED TO REMEMBER

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:37.553
THAT WHILE EXPANDING

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.488

LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THIS

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:51.100
IS NOT WHAT THEY NEED THEY NEED

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:53.202
FLEXIBILITY. WE NEED TO

AT THE TIME THAT I'VE SPENT

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:30.973
WITH THE DISADVANTAGED

FOR OUR SMALL DISADVANTAGED

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:50.325
SCHOOLS WHO SIMPLY CANNOT

AFFORD ALL THESE GREAT PROGRAMS.

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:54.463
THIS DOES NOT PROVIDE THAT FOR

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:56.598

IS WE CAN DO BETTER. WE CAN DO

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:20.789
BETTER THAN THROWING OUT THE

LOCAL CONTROL. THAT MANY OF US.

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:29.431

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:44.379
ME QUESTION. THE TRANSPARENCY

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:45.747
OF THIS WE ALL KNOW WE DIDN'T

DO A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WE

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:48.317

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:51.253
DIDN'T MAKE IT. YOU KNOW. THE

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.925
WAY WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:57.993
THANKFULLY WE WE'VE ALL HAD A

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.762

MEMBERS I MEAN SERIOUSLY YOU.

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:09.738
TO THROW OUT THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:10.339
FORMULA THAT WE'VE ALL WORKED

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:15.544
ON. SOME OF Y'ALL NINE YEARS

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.746
SOME OF US SEVEN YEARS. SOME OF

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.314
US ALITTLE BIT LESS BUT TO

01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:22.851
THROW THAT AWAY. NOW AFTER THE

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.887
PANDEMIC AFTER WE KNOW THAT

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:30.058
THESE PEOPLE ARE BEGGING US. MY

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:30.592
COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:33.262
CORRECT WITH OVER NINE HUNDRED

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:34.830
DIFFERENT DISTRICTS IN EVERY

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:35.330
SINGLE ONE OF THEM WORKS

01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:38.934
DIFFERENTLY. THEIR POPULATIONS

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:40.869
ARE DIFFERENT THEIR CHALLENGES

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.638
ARE DIFFERENT. WE'RE GOING TO

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:45.374
TAKE AWAY. THE ONE TOOL THAT IS

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:49.077
NECESSARY. TO HELP THEM ADDRESS

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:52.514
THEIR LOCAL POPULATIONS MEMBERS

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.783
WE CAN DO BETTER. I ENCOURAGE

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:59.688
YOU ALL. TO DO THAT I'M NOT

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:00.222
VOTING ON THIS AND NEITHER

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:05.027
SHOULD YOU. MR GALLAGHER YOU

ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH THANK YOU

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:12.234
MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- AND I

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:14.169
DO WANT TO SIDE START BY SAYING

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:15.637
I THINK THERE WAS SOME SOME

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:17.506
VERY INCREDIBLE BIPARTISAN WORK

01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:19.942
DONE THIS YEAR IN THE EDUCATION

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:22.945
BUDGET SUB- AND I GIVE CREDIT

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:24.947
TO THE CHAIRMAN. OF THAT

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.915
SUBCOMMITTEE AS WE WORK THROUGH

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.583
MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES AND I

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.218
THINK THERE IS. YOU KNOW AS HAS

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.520
BEEN SAID I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:16:31.586 --> 01:16:34.189
VERY POSITIVE THINGS- THAT HAVE

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:34.756
BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH THAT

01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:37.326
WORK- I WISH THAT SOME OF THE

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:38.627
THINGS THAT WE REALLY PUSH

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:40.195
FORWARD OF ONE OUT. IN THE

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:42.397
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR.

01:16:42.464 --> 01:16:43.131
BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO

01:16:43.198 --> 01:16:45.167
POINT TO IN TERMS OF THE

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:47.502
INCREASES TO SPECIAL EDUCATION.

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:49.037
THE INCREASE IN AND ENSURING

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:50.539
THAT THERE WOULD BE A COLA

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:53.375
INCREASE FOR C. T. VITAL CTE

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:55.610
PROGRAMS THAT WE NEED. IN OUR

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:57.879
SCHOOLS THERE ARE THINGS I

01:16:57.946 --> 01:17:00.215
THINK WE CAN POINT TO A RECORD.

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:04.419
EDUCATION FUNDING BUDGET.

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:05.420
GETTING FUNDING OTHERS

01:17:05.487 --> 01:17:06.755
DESPERATELY NEEDED IN AND

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.423
ESPECIALLY WITH EVERYTHING THAT

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:10.258
OUR SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN THROUGH

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:12.027
IN THIS PAST YEAR ALL POSITIVE

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:14.229
THINGS BUT UNFORTUNATELY I

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.264
CANNOT SUPPORT. THIS TRAILER

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:17.966
BILL IN THIS ULTIMATE DEAL

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.202
TODAY AND I WANT TO OUTLINE WHY.

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:20.702
BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:23.905
IMPORTANT. NUMBER ONE THIS BILL

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:25.807
UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:28.543
CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:30.312
INDEPENDENT STUDY REQUIREMENTS

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.447
THOUGH I THINK ARE A GOOD TOOL

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.316
TO ENSURE THAT OUR TRADITIONAL

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:38.320
PUBLIC SCHOOLS DON'T PLAY GAMES.

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:40.489
LIKE SAN FRANCISCO DID SEVER

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.557
CISCO UNIFIED DID AND NOT

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:44.626
OPENING AND HAVING IT IN PERSON

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:46.128
INSTRUCTION IT IS NOT

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:48.196
APPROPRIATE TO APPLY TO USE A

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:49.631
BACK DOOR TO SOMEHOW USE

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:51.299
INDEPENDENT STUDY TO GET AT.

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:54.302
NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:54.870
WHO ACTUALLY WERE THE SAVING

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:57.439
GRACE. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.207
DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:01.209
ACTUALLY PERFORMED VERY WELL

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:02.544
AND HELP ENSURE THAT KIDS WERE

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:04.679
GETTING AN ADEQUATE EDUCATION

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.381
AT A TIME WHEN THEY COULD NOT

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:08.784
BE. IN PERSON. WE ACTUALLY

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.786
GROWTH IN PEOPLE GOING TO NON

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:13.055
CLASSROOM BAY CHARTERS DURING

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:16.024
THIS PANDEMIC. THE CONTINUE

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:18.326
MORATORIUM ON NOT ALLOWING ANY

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:19.561
MORE NON CLASSROOM BASED

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:22.164
CHARTERS IS UNFAIR AND IT

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:25.834
SHOULD BE PART OF THIS DEAL. IN

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:27.235
ADDITION TO IT SHUTS DOWN

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:30.105
FUNDING FOR ANY CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:32.207
FOR THE NEW EXPANDED LEARNING

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:34.876
OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. OUR NON

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:36.378
CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS ARE

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:38.814
NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THAT. THIS IS

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.215
A AND KEEP IN MIND THIS IS A

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:41.883
CATEGORICAL PROGRAM NOW THAT

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.685
WE'RE CREATING THIS SUPPOSED TO

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:45.387
BE FOR OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.955
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES BUT

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:48.056
WE'RE GOING TO SAY THAT NON

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:50.926
CLASSROOM THAT CHARTERS. CAN'T

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:53.128
HAVE THAT. THAT'S WRONG. IT'S

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:53.695
WRONG TO BE IN THIS TRAILER

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:56.898
BILL. AT THE LAST MINUTE TO PUT

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:59.901
THESE THINGS IN HERE. THE OTHER

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:02.270
THING IS CONCENTRATION GRANT

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:03.872
FUNDING INSTEAD OF HAVING

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:04.773
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR ALL

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.609
DISTRICTS IS WRONG THE GOVERNOR

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:08.710
IS THE ONE WHO PUSH THAT BY THE

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:10.812
WAY THE GOVERNOR SAID MONEY

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:12.481
SHOULD GO TO CONCENTRATION.

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:14.616
GRANTS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.751
THAT MEANS THAT ONLY CERTAIN

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:17.219
SCHOOLS WILL GET THAT

01:19:17.285 --> 01:19:19.788
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND THAT

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:23.391
MEANS THAT LOW INCOME. ENGLISH

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:24.893
LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.194
KIDS IN OTHER SCHOOLS WON'T GET

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:27.729
THAT INCREASE FUNDING AND THAT

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:30.499
IS WRONG. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:31.166
SHOULD HAVE PUSHED BACK AGAINST

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:32.467
THE GOVERNOR AND SAID NO WE'RE

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.136
DOING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.605
ACROSS THE BOARD TO HELP ALL

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:39.841
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN ALL KIDS.

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:41.176
I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED WITH

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:41.943
RECORD FUNDING THEY WERE

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:43.378
PUTTING OUT THERE THERE IS A

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:44.846
VERY DANGEROUS LACK OF

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:47.249
ACCOUNTABILITY. IN THIS BILL

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:47.849
AND I'LL POINT OUT A COUPLE OF

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:50.519
THINGS. THE DASHBOARD IS ONCE

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:53.321
AGAIN SUSPENDED. YEAH I KNOW

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:55.257
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET-COMMITTEE AGREES WITH ME ON

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:56.858
THIS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.127
GET THAT ACCOUNTABILITY BACK WE

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:00.762
NEED TO HOLD THE

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:01.830
ADMINISTRATION'S FEET TO THE

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:03.899
FIRE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:05.400
LOOKING AT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:08.203
WE'RE WE'RE LOSING TWO YEARS

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.803
TWO YEARS WORTH OF DATA THAT.

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:11.239
COULD BE HELPFUL. AND HELPING

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:12.874

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:14.476
SCHOOLS TO MAKE SURE THOSE KIDS

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:16.077
IN THOSE SCHOOLS ULTIMATELY.

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:18.246
ARE GETTING A GOOD EDUCATION

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:18.914
AND THERE'S TECHNICAL

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.082
ASSISTANCE. COMING IN TO HELP

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.817
SUPPORT SCHOOLS THAT AREN'T

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:23.785
MEET THAT AREN'T MAKING THE

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:25.820
GRADE. WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.656
THIS BUDGET WE TAKE IT OUT WE

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:31.326
WAIVE. IN THIS BUDGET WE WAIVE

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.028
UNANNOUNCED VISITS TO LOW

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.529
PERFORMING SCHOOLS WHICH IS

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.698
WHERE THAT. THIRTY SECONDS AT A

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:37.866
TIME WHEN WE NEED GREATER

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.634
ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURETHAT

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:41.736
NONE OF OUR KIDS ARE FALLING

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.672
BEHIND AND ALTERNATELY AND THIS

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:45.640
IS. A BIT OF A CHANGE OF HEART

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:47.409
FOR ME I THINK THAT THE T. K.

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:49.644
FOCUS. IS THE WRONG POLICY

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:51.413
CHOICES AND I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:53.782
THIS A LOT THIS YEAR. BUT BY

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:55.584
FOCUSING THAT MONEY ON T. K.

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.352
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE WE

01:20:57.419 --> 01:20:57.886
CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THE

01:20:57.953 --> 01:20:59.821
FACILITIES. INSTEAD OF

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:01.122
INVESTING IN OUR EXISTING

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:03.225
INFRASTRUCTURE OF CHILD CARE

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:05.260
AND EARLY EDUCATION I THINK IS

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:06.995
ULTIMATELY THE WRONG. POLICY

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.930
CHOICES THINK WE WILL FIND THAT

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:10.799
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY.

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:12.701
SUSTAINABLY TO HAVE THESE T. K.

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:15.237
PROGRAMS WE SHOULD INSTEAD

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:17.839
REALLY FOCUSING ON EXPANDING-

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.307
EXPANDING SLOTS IN EARLY

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.743

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:24.846
REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE GOING

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.381
TO BE ADDRESSED BUT THAT'S

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:28.149
WHERE OUR FOCUS I THINK TRULY

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:28.783
NEEDS TO BE TO ENSURE THAT OUR

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:31.152

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:43.798
THAT'S FAMILIAR TO MANY OF US

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.433
IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.

UNIFIED GETS 40% LESS AND ABA

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.185
FUNDING THE NEIGHBORING LOS

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:08.356
ANGELES UNIFIED. YOU KNOW. I AM

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:13.761
WAITING. JUST SAYS BACK IN

01:27:13.828 --> 01:27:15.129
NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WHEN THERE

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:17.599
WERE FAMILIES THAT CHALLENGED.

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:20.668
THE INEVITABLE STATE FUNDING

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:23.838
SYSTEM THROUGH A SERIES OF

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:25.873
LAWSUITS THE SERRANO VERSUS

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.643
PRIEST LAWSUITS. THAT

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:30.645
INVALIDATED THE STATE FUNDING

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:32.246
BASED ON A DENIAL OF EQUAL

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:35.850
PROTECTION OF EQUAL. OF EQUAL

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.720
TREATMENT I AM WAITING TO SEE

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:41.155
IF SOMEONE SOMEWHERE IN THE

01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:43.057
STATE RISES UP TO CHALLENGE

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:44.926
THOSE GROWING INEQUITIES I KNOW

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:48.429
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WE TRY. TO

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:51.265
WE PUT WE PROPOSE WE PASSED THE

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:54.202
COMPROMISE THE LEGISLATIVE.

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:57.939
BUDGET HAD THE DOLLARS TO

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.574
FOLLOW THE DISADVANTAGED

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:01.943
STUDENTS WITH. THE SUPPLEMENTAL

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:04.545
GRANTS BUT THIS ABBASI'S ON THE

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.547
CONCENTRATION GRANTS THAT THE

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:09.217
GOVERNOR INSISTED INSISTED UPON

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:12.153
AS A STEP AWAY FROM YOU CAN

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.455
PROTECTION FOR ALL STUDENTS.

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:17.925
AND SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. THE

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:19.961
INADEQUACY OF THE BASE GRANT

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:20.995
YOU KNOW THE BREAD AND BUTTER

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:23.097
FUNDING THAT GOES TO ALL SCHOOL

01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:26.367
DISTRICTS. SO THAT WE CAN

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:29.537
ENSURE. THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AN

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:32.874
ADEQUATE. FUNDING I MEAN THIS

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.909
THIS BUDGET BECAUSE IT HAS SO

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:38.479
MUCH MONEY ONE TIME FUNDS FOR

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:40.048
EVERYONE IT MASKS A LOT OF

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:44.185
THESE. OF THESE PROBLEMS BUT

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:47.021
BUT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. THE

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:49.090
GROWING INEQUITY IN TERMS OF

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:49.624
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:51.759
FORMULA. I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:54.195
WORKING WELL WITH ALL OF YOU TO

ADDRESS THIS ONGOING ISSUE.

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.837
AMOS MURATSUCHI MR KILEY YOU

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:08.810
ARE RECOGNIZED. FOR FIFTEEN

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:09.977
MONTHS CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAVE

01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:11.879
BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR NO GOOD

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:13.514
REASON WE'VE BEEN FORTY NINTH

01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:15.717
OR FIFTIETH IN THE COUNTRY IN

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:16.651
GETTING KIDS BACK TO THE

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:17.852
CLASSROOM AND IS THIS RESULTED

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:19.821
IN SOME GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN

01:29:19.887 --> 01:29:21.556
DISEASE CONTROL NOW WE'VE DONE

01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:23.458
AS BAD OR POORLY AS STATES

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:25.226
WHERE KIDS HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL.

01:29:25.293 --> 01:29:27.361
FULL TIME. SO YOU THINK WE'LL

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:27.929
BE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:29.363
POWER TO MAKE SURE THIS NEVER

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:31.799
HAPPENS AGAIN. BUT INSTEAD THIS

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:34.102
BILL EXPLICITLY CONTEMPLATES. A

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:36.804
PERMANENT POLICY OF NON DATA

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:39.474
BASED SHUTDOWNS. BUT EVEN

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.309
BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN.

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:43.177
CALIFORNIA'S UNDER PERFORMANCE

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:43.978
WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:46.547
EDUCATION WAS STAGGERING WE HAD

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.382
SOME OF THE NATION'S LARGEST

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:50.551
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS WE RANK FORTY

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.386
NINE. AT A FIFTY IN EDUCATION

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:53.788
IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:54.222
IT'S EASY TO BECOME

01:29:54.288 --> 01:29:56.858
DESENSITIZED TO THESE NUMBERS

01:29:56.924 --> 01:29:57.892
BECAUSE WE'RE LAST IN SO MANY

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:59.894
THINGS BUT THAT'S MILLIONSOF

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:01.462
KIDS WHO ARE NOT GETTING THE

01:30:01.529 --> 01:30:02.764
EDUCATION THEY NEED SOME OF

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:04.065
THEM EVEN SUED THE STATE

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:06.501
SUCCESSFULLY. BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:08.469
NOT BEING TAUGHT THREE. SO WHAT

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:10.171
DOES THIS BILL O WELL IT

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:11.372
PROVIDES FOURTEEN BILLION

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.241
DOLLARS MORE IN FUNDING. AND

01:30:13.307 --> 01:30:14.642
THAT MAY COME AS GOOD NEWS TO

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:15.843
SOME BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:17.245
BELIEVE IT'S GOOD NEWS. FOR

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:19.647
CALIFORNIA KIDS. ARE EDUCATION

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:21.349
SPENDING HAS INCREASED BY SIXTY

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:22.717
BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:25.186
DECADE WITH NO DEMONSTRABLE

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:27.388
IMPACT. ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT.

01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:28.890
SO IF THE LAST SIXTY BILLION

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:30.825
DIDN'T HELP. WHILE THE NEXT

01:30:30.892 --> 01:30:33.161
FOURTEEN BILLION. IN FACT THIS

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:35.863
BILL REINFORCES. A FAILING

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:39.400
MODEL IT DIED REINFORCES A

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:42.103
MODEL WHERE KIDS ARE ASSIGNED

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:44.539
TO ONE SCHOOL AND THEY ARE

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:45.573
EXPECTED TO GO TO THAT SCHOOL

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.574
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE IT OR NOT

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:47.642
WHETHER IT'S A GOOD SCHOOL OR

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:50.478
NOT WHETHER IT'S OPEN OR NOT

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:52.580
AND THEN DISTRICTS ARE JUDGED

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:54.448
BASED UPON THEIR COMPLIANCE

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:56.551
WITH STATE MANDATES RATHER THAN

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.186
THEIR RECORD. OF STUDENT

01:30:58.252 --> 01:31:01.022
ACHIEVEMENT. WE CAN DO SO MUCH

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:03.324
GOOD FOR SO MANY KIDS WITH SOME

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:05.226
COMMONSENSE REFORMS IT'S NOT

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:06.794
BRAIN SURGERY LET'S LOOK AT

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:07.762
WHAT WAS HAS WORKED IN OTHER

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.097
STATES. TO HELP KIDS LEARN TO

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:11.766
HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED AND LET'S

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.801
START DOING IT HERE. WE DO NOT

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:16.137
NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROP UP AND

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:18.472
REINFORCE A FAILED PUBLIC

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:19.841
EDUCATION MODEL WE NEED

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.909

OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM NTK

MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:37.952
WEEK REAL PUT OUR SCHOOLS THIS

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:41.389
FALL. WE GET RID OF THE POLICY

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:44.225
THAT HAS- SCHOOLS BE ABLE TO DO

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:45.526
THE DISTANCE LEARNING AND THE

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:47.628
AND THE BIFURCATED ZOOM SCHOOL

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:48.562
BECAUSE THAT WAS AN UNMITIGATED

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:51.966
DISASTER. SO WE ARE GOING BACK

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:54.001
TO SCHOOL WITH FULLY FUNDED.

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.903
PROGRAMS THIS FALL MAKE NO

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:58.973
MISTAKE. BUT I DO WANT TO FOCUS

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.375
ON THE ISSUE THAT THE THAT THAT

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:03.544
THIS SOMEHOW WASN'T A PROCESS

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:04.445
WE LOOKED INTO THE

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:05.746
CONSIDERATION OF ALL SCHOOLS

01:33:05.813 --> 01:33:07.315
AND ALL DISTRICTS THIS WAS A

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:09.016
VERY CONSENSUS DRIVEN PROCESS

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:11.819
IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE PROBABLY

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:13.487
9098% A CONSENSUS ON OUR

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:16.090
ACTIONS. AND THIS NOTION THAT

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:18.292
WE GET AWAY FROM LOCAL CONTROL

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:20.161
IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE ABOUT TEN

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:21.662
YEARS AGO WE ADOPTED THE L. C.

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:23.831
F. F. POLICY. THAT FOCUSES ON

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:26.167
GIVING MORE MONEY TO OUR LOCAL

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:26.767
SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THEY CAN

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:29.036
MAKE THEIR CHOICES. WE DO THAT

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:30.371
WE FOCUS ON THE BASIS OF

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:33.107
FUNDING WE ALSO REALIZE. THAT

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.809
SCHOOLS THEY GET MORE MONEY

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:36.344
THEY HAVE MORE PROBLEMS AND I'D

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:38.112
LIKE TO ASK ANY OF YOU AND YOUR

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:39.981
COMMUNITIES IF YOU SAY YOU WANT

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:40.681
MORE MONEY THAN THE SCHOOL

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:42.350
ACROSS THE STREET. DO YOU WANT

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:43.851
A SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS A LOT OF

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:45.186
THESE CHALLENGES THAT FOCUSES

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:47.288
ON OVER SOMETIMES 70% OF YOUR

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:49.423
STUDENTS. OTHER LOW INCOME

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:50.291
FOSTER YOUTH ARE ENGLISH

01:33:50.358 --> 01:33:51.826
LANGUAGE LEARNERS BECAUSE

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:53.761
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EDUCATING

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:56.197
THESE SCHOOLS THESE COMMUNITIES

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:59.066
COST MORE MONEY THAT WAS. THE

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:00.401
CHOICE THAT WE MADE WITH

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.671
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT A DECADE AGO

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:05.039
WE FOLLOW THIS TO THE LAW. AND

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:06.974
WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS WHAT
