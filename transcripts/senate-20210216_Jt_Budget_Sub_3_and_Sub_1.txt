RECONVENE AND CONTINUE ON TO PART B. AFTER A THIRTY MINUTE BREAK BETWEEN PART A AND PART B. AND JUST TO CLARIFY. SINCE HER BUDGET PREVIOUS BUDGET ACT TRANSFERRED PROGRAMS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS WITHIN THE JURIDICTION OF SUB ONE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF SUB THREE IT GETS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT IF THERE'S ANY EARLY ACTION THOSE THINGS FALL BACK TO SUB ONE. OTHERWISE IT GOES THERE ARE STILL ONE PART THAT'S REMAINING WITH SUB ONE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO HANDLE THIS WAS TO HAVE A JOINT HEARING AND EVEN THE STATE OF THE TRANSITION IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE WILL BE DISCUSSING TODAY SO WITH THAT- SENATOR EGGMAN DO YOU HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS ARE JUST GLAD TO BE HERE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO GOING FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER SENATORS WISH TO MAKE AN OPENING COMMENT. SENATOR MAN YES I AM I AM NEW TO THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC AND IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT I DID JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE- WHEN I WAS A PROFESSOR AT UCI- THE SCHOOL ALL RIGHT TODD WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AND AS SOMEONE WHO SITS ON SUB ONE THE EDUCATION SUBCOMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT EARLY CHILD CARE WERE EMPHASIZING THE EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS OF IT THE RESEARCH IS VERY CLEAR. THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT IS FUNDAMENTALLY AN ISSUE OF EDUCATION AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T GET LOST AS WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR EARLY CHILD CARE I ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THIS ALL GETS MOVED OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THAT NOT. MAKING THIS A STRATIFIED PROGRAM ONE THAT IS RESIGNED TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE BUT- THEY WERE EMPATHIZING CHILDCARE FOR ALL FAMILIES- BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S IT BRIEFINGS TODAY REPORTED TESTIMONY FROM ALEJO. AND THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY CENTER GOVERNMENT. WE'RE GOING TO DO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE THE CHILD CARE OVERVIEW. AND THE PEOPLE. AND IN SOME CASES WE HAVE. A SECOND PEOPLE FROM THE SAME. AGENCY AND WILL LEAVE IT TO THE FIRST PERSON TO INTRODUCE THEM. IF THAT'S THE CASE SO IN THIS ISSUE ARE WE OBSERVE CORTEZ FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND WE HAVE SERRA BERKNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CARLOS AGUILERA IS ALSO HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN WE HAVE SERRA NOVEL MORGAN. OF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WILL GO IN THAT ORDER SO WE'LL START WITH- SARAH CORTEZ AND WILL HOLD ALL QUESTIONS. TILL AFTER ALL PANELISTS HAVE PRESENTED. ARE WELCOME THIS CORTES. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY SARAH CORTEZ AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO IF I WAS ASKED TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE STATE SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE SYSTEM. I'LL BE REFERENCING A FEW FIGURES FROM YOUR AGENDA FOR THOSE THAT HAVE THEIR AGENDA HANDY. ON DURING THIS PRESENTATION. OF THE STATE SUBSIDIZES SEVERAL CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. THESE ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR AGENDA. THE STATE SPEND ROUGHLY FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION TO SERVE AN ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN IN THE PROGRAMS LISTED ON PEACHTREE. BURKE HOW ARE SHALL CARE IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THE STATE SIR ALL CHILDREN MEETING THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. FOR ALL OTHER PROGRAMS LISTED ON PAGE THREE THE AMOUNT OF THE CHILDREN- THE STATE ABLE TO SERVE IS GENERALLY SET ANNUALLY BY THE STATE DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. THE STATE HAS TWO TYPES OF CHILD CARE PROGRAMS EITHER VOUCHER BASED PROGRAMS OR DIRECT CONTACT RAMPS. HOW TO REACH PROGRAMS PRIMARILY CAL WORKS HEALTHCARE AND THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR THESE PROGRAMS- HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE REIMBURSED BASED ON THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE. THREE ITSELF IS BASED ON A SURVEY CONDUCTED EVERY OTHER YEAR BUT THE STATE DETERMINES WHAT SURVEY TO USE WE ARE CURRENTLY USING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SURVEY- THE RATE REGIONAL MARKET RATE VARIES BY COUNTY ASIAN CHILD SERVED AMOUNT OF CARE USE AND THE TYPE OF CHILD CARE. THE TYPE OF CHILD CARE PROVIDER. FOR THESE PROGRAMS FAMILIES WILL GAIN ELIGIBILITY FROM CHILD CARE WITH THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT OR AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT AGENCY. ONCE THE FAMILY RECEIVED ELIGIBILITY YOU CAN USE THE VOUCHER- TO RECEIVE HEALTHCARE FROM ANY PROVIDER AT HER FOR HER FIRST IN ANY SETTING IT PREFERS. WE ALSO HAVE DIRECT CONTRACTOR FIGHTERS PRIMARILY EITHER PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM OR THE GENERAL CHILDCARE PROGRAM. DIRECT CONTRACT WRITERS ARE REIMBURSED BY THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE SO THIS IS THE RATE SAID ANNUALLY BY THE STATE. THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS ADJUSTED BY AGE THE AMOUNT OF CARE USED- AND SOME OTHER FACTORS IN MOST NOTABLY DIFFERS FROM THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE THAT THE VOUCHER PROVIDERS. ARE REIMBURSED BASED ON- BECAUSE THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE DOESN'T HAVE A GEOGRAPHIC ADJUSTMENT. SO THESE PROVIDERS DRIVE CONTRACT PROVIDERS CONTRACT WITH THE STATE TO SERVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CHILDREN SO FAMILIES WILL WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE CONTRACTED PROVIDER TO BECOMING A WORLD IN THESE PROGRAMS. H. FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA BEGINS THE DISCUSSION OF THE PANDEMIC IMPACT AND RESPONSE ON CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES. CHILL- HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAVE REPORTED YOU SURVEYS THAT THEY ARE SERVING FEWER CHILDREN AND ARE EXPERIENCING LOSS OF INCOME DUE TO SERVING LESS SHELTER AND- PROVIDERS ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING HIGHER OPERATION COSTS STUDENT CLEANING SANITATION. AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. AGE SIX OF YOUR AGENDA HAS SOME INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSE CLOSURES- AND ALSO ON PAGE SIX THERE'S A TABLE OR THE START OF A TABLE THAT LISTS THE PANDEMIC RELATED ACTIONS TODAY AND THAT WERE PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT THE STATE SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW. WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO GOOD MORNING THIS IS CARLOS SECULAR AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND HI MY COLLEAGUES ARE PARTNER WITH ME AS WELL SO I JUST WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT TO THE OVERVIEW SENSE. TWENTY NINETEEN. THE STATE HAS INVESTED FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING. FOR THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS INCLUDING FUNDING FOR ONGOING CHILD CARE SLOTS SUPPORTING TWELVE MONTH COLLEGE ABILITY IN COVERAGE PROGRAMS AND A LIMB ELIMINATING NEGATIVE GROWTH ADJUSTMENTS. MORE RECENTLY- THE STATE HAS ALLOCATED NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP REDUCE LONG TERM LOSSES IN ITS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM DUE TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT THERE IS A SHIFT OF CHILD CARE PROGRAMS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE PROPOSAL IS TO SHIFT THIRTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION FOUR POINT NINE ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE POINT SEVEN POSITIONS FOR STATE OPERATIONS. FURTHER THREE POINT ONE BILLION OR ONE POINT THREE BILLION GENERAL FUND WILL BE SHIFTED TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE. THE SECOND PLEASE% YOUR COMMENTS YES SIR THAT. IS IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT NOW WILL MOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU TEARS AND MEMBERS PERINATAL MORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PERHAPS THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. THE AGENDA PROVIDES A REALLY SMALL OVERVIEW AT THE EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA SO I'M GONNA TOUCH BRIEFLY ON A FEW SYSTEMS COMPONENTS TO BUILD DOC WHAT MS CORTEZ SHARED AND WHAT'S IN YOUR AGENDA. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS CURRENTLY SERVE APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN IN SUBSIDIZED. EARLY LEARNING. PROGRAMS AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED CURRENTLY WE ADMINISTER BOTH DIRECT CONTRACTING AND ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM. S. CONTRACTED PROGRAMS ARE VERY FOCUSED ON THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN AND HAVE TO MEET PROGRAM STANDARDS WHAT ABOUT YOUR PROGRAMS PROVIDE ACCESS TO PRIVATE MARKET SETTINGS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF QUALITY. BOTH DIRECT CONTRACTED PROGRAMS AND CULTURE PROGRAM SERVES CHILDREN THREE CENTERS AND YOUR FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES. BROWN'S ALSO SERVE CHILDREN AND FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR LICENSE EXAM TOM SETTINGS. THE COSBY MORE ARE PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AS BAD AS THE PERMANENT WAR REMAIN AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION. OUR DATA SHOWS THERE'S ABOUT HALF A MILLION CHILDREN AGES THREE AND FOUR IN CALIFORNIA. AMONG THEM AROUND SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE SERVED IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL. PROGRAM FOR ABOUT SIXTY. PERCENT OF YOUR THREE AND FOUR WE CURRENT SERVE HUNDRED. ONE THOUSAND PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. MAYBE NOT A LITTLE BACK TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALLOCATES A TOTAL OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION TO EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS ACROSS SEAT AND THE CHILD AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS. WELL THERE IS A DECREASE IN THE TOTAL BUDGET AMOUNT FROM LAST YEAR DUE TO THE REMOVAL OF ONE TIME FEDERAL FINES WE APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION STATE INVESTMENT AND ONGOING RESOURCES. IS THAT THE CLEAN WE APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION IN CURRENT YEAR PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FROM. RIGHT NOW ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT STOCKS. AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL FORTY FOUR MILLION PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. SPOTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHILE. CURRENTLY TO MAKE THE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IN THE CURRENT YEAR AVAILABLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ALSO WE APPRECIATE. THE EFFORTS PROGRAMS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED PROJECT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR PROGRAMMES DID NOT RECEIVE A CALL LAST YEAR. IN LIGHT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AROUND K. TWELVE AS WELL AS HOW MUCH YOUR PROGRAMS ARE STRUGGLING WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER GIVING THEM THE SAME COLOR TO EARLY LEARNING AS THEY HAVE TO K. TWELVE. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES IN CAR WORK SPEECH TO YOU AND THREE. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO GO DEEPER INTO THOSE ESTIMATES IF YOU. ALL AS WE LOOK INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO ENSURING ALL CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION THE BEST SUPPORT THEM IN REACHING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND ACHIEVING NEST BY ELEVATING STRATEGIES OUTLINED IN THAT MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE AROUND HAVING A STRONG ITS DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FOR UNIVERSAL PRE K. SYSTEM AND IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICE TO SAYS THAT SUPPORT EQUITY AND ALREADY NOW. RESEARCH TELLS US THAT THE FIRST EIGHT YEARS OF LIFE ARE CRUCIAL TIME FOR VALIDATION OR LEARNING. IN THAT THOSE YEARS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO. CAPS THAT YOU IN EQUITIES ARE THAT. SYSTEM AND BEYOND. WOMEN ARE RESEARCH BY WEST STANDING UC BERKELEY THERE ARE CHILDREN IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND YOU SAID SOMETHING CALLED THE DESIRED RESULTS DEVELOPMENTAL PROFILE AS WELL AS QUALITY COUNTS CALIFORNIA. READING OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE HIGHEST YEARS IT'S UNIFIED ARE STRONGER BUT THEY'RE DEVELOPMENTS ON LEARNING OUTCOMES IN CHILDREN ARE HERE THREE OR ITS YEAR FOR. RESEARCH ALSO CLEARLY INDICATES THAT YOUR LANGUAGE LEARNERS BENEFIT EVEN MORE FROM ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CSGP SPECIFICALLY THEIR LEARNING GAPS WERE NARROWER IN TIER FIVE THEN THEY WORK OR DO A LANGUAGE LEARNERS IN TWO YEARS THREE. SHOWING STRONG RESULTS THE QUALITY DOES MATTER BURKE PRESCHOOL CHILDREN. AND NEEDING TO CONTINUE THEIR- AS A RESULT IN RETALIATION DESTROYED HIGH IN THE- BEDROOM. BOTH ONLINE AND CURRENT PROGRAMS QUALITIES. ADDRESSING NOT NEED FOR NEXT DELIVERY. IMPORTANTE QUE EXTENSION TO OUR LEARNERS INCLUDING AND NOT ADDRESS THE RATIO CRITICIZED ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT. ENSURING THAT WE CAN BE INCLUSIVE OF ALL CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND ALL OF OUR PROGRAM ELIMINATING THINGS LIKE EXCLUSIONARY DISCIPLINE PRACTICES AND STRONGLY SUPPORTING DOING WHICH LEARNERS. AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE SCOPE. ARE MARC LEVINE PRESCHOOL AND THE TRANSITIONS TO K. K. FIRST SECOND AND THIRD. DO YOU REALLY SUPPORT CURRICULUM. ASK THEM TO BEST SUPPORT LEARNING. AS THE LAST PIECE AND GOING AFTER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MISSED CORTEZ SHOWED. THE RATES. ON AVERAGE AS WE LOOK AT OURS CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THE RATES FOR THAT PROGRAM. NEED TO GET ME AND YOUR FROM. ON AVERAGE RULING. AS CHILDREN ARE IN THE STATE THE RMR. THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THE ARE MARKED FOR THE OTHER PART OF THE SYSTEM IS A LITTLE UNDER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SO IF YOU ARE TAKING YOUR VOUCHER TO HIRE PROGRAM YOU WOULD GET ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND ALONG WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE E. P. BUT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOUR G. ASKED ARTIST STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR C. S. P. P. AB. ONE THOUSAND LAST SPRING. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE TO MEET HIGH QUALITY PROGRAM STANDARDS. RCSD PROGRAMS ALSO SEE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PER CHILD THAN A CHEESECAKE PROGRAM. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ARE PART EIGHTY K. RECEIVED ABOUT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND. MARK FOR FRIENDS FOR CHILD IN THE PARKING YES HE P. ABOUT HIGHER RATES ACROSS THE SYSTEM OUR PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO MEET THE- GOALS OF THAT MASTER PLAN. ENGINE AT DRESS THINGS LIKE ART TEACHER RETENTION AND PAY. YES THESE ARE ESPECIALLY CRITICAL IN THAT LIGHT AT THE CHALLENGES POSED BY COPING NINETEEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANY. ANSWER. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. I'MGOING LEAD OFF WITH A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THE FIRST ONE. MAYBE I SHOULD START WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEN ASK IF THE- LA OVER DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS COMMON. VOTE ON IN OUR AGENDA PACKET IT SHOWS THAT STAGE TO CAO WORKS CHILD CARE. IS RECOMMENDED FOR EIGHTEEN POINT 5% REDUCTION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. COULD YOU EXPLAIN- WHY THAT'S THE RECOMMENDATION. MORNINGS A SERVER NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL GO AHEAD AND START WITH SOME COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STAGE CHIU CHILD CARE PROGRAM- BUT NAMELY WHAT WE DO HERE AT FINANCES THAT WE TRACK THOSE NUMBERS ARE SIMILARLY TO WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE L. A. OWNS PART OF EDUCATION DO AS WELL- AND WE ADJUST THE BUDGET CORRESPONDINGLY TO WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING TO THE CASELOAD IN THE COST PER CASE FOR CHILD CARE AND BOTH THE STAGE TWO AND STAGE THREE PROGRAM. SO A TREND THAT WE HAVE BEEN NOTICING FOR AT LEAST THE LAST YEAR OR TWO IS THAT THE CASE WILL NUMBER IN STAGE TWO HAS BEEN GOING DOWN IT'S BEEN DECREASING AND THERE ARE CERTAIN POLICY IMPLICATIONS THAT BECAUSE THAT ON THAT OUR DEPARTMENTAL COLLEAGUES MIGHT HAVE A BETTER INSIGHT INTO- BUT WE SIMPLY ADJUSTS THE BUDGET ALLOCATIONS BASED OFF THOSE NUMBERS A STAGE TO HAVE BEEN DECREASING STAGE THREE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN INCREASING- CASELOAD WISE AT LEAST- IN SORT OF EQUAL AMOUNTS SO IN THE BUDGET YEAR- THE RECOMMENDATION AND THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD IS TO DECREASE STAGE TWO BY THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE STAGE THREE. BY A SIMILAR AMOUNT IT'S ALMOST AND THAT- ZERO EFFECT ON THE HOW IT WORKS PROGRAMS AS A WHOLE AT LEAST BETWEEN STAGE TWO AND STAGE THREE- BUT I'LL PASS IT OFF TO MY L. A. O. OR C. CALLING WILL NOT BE JUST CLARIFY ONE THING SO YOU MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION BASED ON THE TRENDS BUT THEY'RE THE ONES MORE ABLE TO SPEAK TO WHY THE TRENDS. ARE HAPPENING IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING. WE SPEAK WITHOUT VERY. A WHAT'S HAPPENING IN PROGRAM. WE DO. THE A HARPER. EXPERT PARTNERS- BUT YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO COMMENT ON THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT YOU YEAH. YOUR YOU MIGHT TALK TO HIM ALL THE TIME BUT YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO COMMENT ON WHY YOU SEE THE TRENDS HAPPENING. I'LL CERTAINLY LET THEM SPEAK TO- SINCE SPEECH YOUR WHAT'S GOING ON THE PERSONS THEY HAVE A MORE DIRECT LINE- TO WHAT'S HAPPENING TO PROVIDERS ON THE GROUND I WILL SAY WHEN WE DERECHOS CONVERSATIONS WE KNOW THAT. THERE ARE CERTAINLY A LOT OF CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THOSE PROGRAMS ONE AT LEAST TRY AND THAT WE'RE NOTICING IT. EVER SINCE. I WAS TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY WAS INTRODUCED IN THOSE PROGRAMS. I'LL WE MAY BE SEEING SOME. SOME FAMILY STAYING IN THE STATE RUN PROGRAM THE LONGER AS OPPOSED TO GOING INTO THE STATE STREET PROGRAM SO THAT COULD BE PART OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE SEEING WHAT WE ARE SEEING. STAGE TWO OKAY LET ME GO TO THAT LA- WHEN ASKED IF YOU WOULD COMMENT ON THAT. WHY DO YOU THINK THESE TRENDS MIGHT BE HAPPENING- IN THE ONE THING ALL I- TO. OF COMMON IS. A THESE ESTá. THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES AT THIS POINT- BUT THE AGREED UPON ESTIMATES ARE TRYING TO- PREDICT WHAT CASELOAD WILL BE IN THE FUTURE SO IT'S BEEN QUITE. A DIFFICULT TASK IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. I'M WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THESE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE CHANGED ON THE CASE THAT ESTIMATE SO DRASTICALLY. SO IF YOU YEARS AGO- AND THIS PARTNER JUST MENTION TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY SO A FEW YEARS AGO. WHEN TOLD WITH ELIGIBILITY WAS IMPLEMENTED- FOR STAGE TWO AND THREE FIRST- WE REALLY DID SEE. A STAGE TWO AND THREE CASELOAD REALLY INCREASE QUITE DRASTICALLY. I'M IN SO NOW IF YOU YEARS DOWN THE LINE. TOLD WITH KNOWLEDGE ABILITY WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED STAGE ONE. AND WE'RE WE'RE SEEING- READ THE DATA REFLECTING THAT THE STATE'S ESTACIO QUESADILLAS IS DECREASING. QUITE DRASTICALLY ALL. YEAH MONITORING THE DATA SO I THINK IN WORKING. TO LOOK INTO AND I'M ANALYZE TO MAKE IT TO ENSURE THAT THE ADMIN. ESTIMATES REASON. ON THE THAT STILL WORK AT. WILL CAN TO DO AS WE AS WE HEAD INTO THE SPRING. I'M ASKING A MOMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO COMMENT BUT LET ME ASK YOU JUST ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION IT SEEMS FROM YOUR ANSWER. THAT YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING THESE TRENDS WERE IN EVIDENCE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO IT'S NOT REALLY A PANDEMIC IMPACT. THE YOUR NOTING IS RELATED TO THIS REDUCTION. YEAH SO- IF SOME OF IT COULD BE PANDEMICS ARE NOT QUITE SURE YET TO BE ABLE TO PARK STYLE KIND OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIKE PANDEMIC RELATED. ON KEESLER TRENDS OR PRE PANDEMIC HE SAID TRYING BUT WE WILL NOTE THAT WE DID SEE. A DECREASE IN IN CASE A TRANSCRIPT HAD TO MAKE AND THEN ONCE A PANDEMIC STARTED IT DID IT DID. THE TRENDS THAT BECAME A LITTLE STEEPER OKAY LET ME ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THE STREETS. I THINK WE WOULD SHARE AN ECHO WETNESS CORTEZ AND- RIGHT YOU SAD THAT WE SAW THESE TRENDS START BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND WE'VE SEEN AND CONTINUE ON THANK YOU. THESE ARE POCKET SIZED THAT TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY DEFINITELY PLAYED A ROLE BUT WITHOUT A CLEAR PEOPLE HAVE STEPPED OVER THE HARD FOR US TO ACTUALLY SEE THE DIRECT CAUSE EVENTS ALL WE CAN DO IS WORK ACROSS SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED. AND THAT TWELVE MONTHS WOULD BE THE LARGEST ONE- AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA FARMERS SERVICES IS ALSO NOW. INITIATED THE TWELVE MONTH FOR STAGE ONE SO WE MAY BE SEEING MORE CHILDREN HELD IN STAGE ONE BEFORE THEY MOVED TO STAGE TWO ONE THREE. ALL OF THOSE TRENDS OR SOMETHING. THAT WILL. WATCH OVER ME. HERE'S TO REALLY ON YOUR- THE INNER. OF BUT POLICY AS WELL AS EXTERNAL FACTORS LIKE. THEN LET ME GO TO A GLOBAL QUESTION THAT MIGHT RELATE TO THIS AND START WITH THE L. A. O. IN RESPONSE. I WONDER IF YOU HAD DATA ON THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF PROVIDERS THAT MAY HAVE CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR TEMPORARILY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND IT AND REFLECTING ON THAT- HOW THAT MADE HIM. IMPACT RE OPENING OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY WHEN WE GET TO IT HELLO. ERROR AND SO THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME INFORMATION PROVIDED IN YOUR AGENDA- ON THIS EXACT QUESTION ON PAGE SIX I'M SO ONE THING I'LL NOTE ABOUT THIS DATA IS THAT THIS IS THE ENTIRE WORLD. OUR LIFE OF THE STATE'S LICENSE I'M CHILD CARE PROVIDER IN THE STATE A COUNTRY THAT APARTMENT A SOCIAL SERVICES- SO WHAT THIS IS NOT SHOWING YOU IS MORE SPECIFIC TO THE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IN- IN IN STAGES OKAY MORE SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR pTO. TWO OR THREE SO- THIS DATA SHOWS CAN BECOME YOUR BREAK OUT OF AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY WHO IS OPEN AND OPERATING WHO IS TEMPORARY- HOW MANY- FACILITIES AND KIND OF HOW THAT EQUATES TO THE NUMBER OF SLOTS- FOR TEMPORARY CLOSE. AND THEN ALSO- IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY BUT IT THOSE NUMBERS DON'T REFLECT ON THE ABILITY TO RE OPEN TO HAVE ANY IDEA WHETHER THAT'S JUST A- A COMPILATION OF CLOSURE. IT IN ANY IDEA WHAT WOULD BE READY. TO RE OPEN IF WE MOVED TO THAT. YEAH THAT SO A QUESTION I KNOW AND HAVE ANSWERS THE WAY WE CAN GET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION IS THROUGH BY RELYING ON SOME OF THE SURVEY DATA. SURVEY INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS- AND THEN THE SURVEYS HAVE REALLY BEEN. TRYING TO GET OUT KIND OF WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS AND WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT- CHILD CARE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN FACING. IS THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY THE SURVEY FINDINGS HARVARD HAVE SHOWN IS THAT. CHILD CARE PROVIDER FACING HIGHER COSTS FROM CLEAN PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. BUT THEY'RE ALSO SERVING- FEWER CHILDREN AND SO THERE WERE THE RECEIVING INCOME FROM FROM CERTAIN FEWER CHILDREN. LET ME ASK IF THE DEPARTMENT. OF EDUCATION HAS ANY COMMENT ON THAT. AT ONCE AGAIN I THINK WE WOULD ECHO. WHAT IT. HAS IT'S JUST SAD IN ADDITION MAKING. AS WE'VE LOOKED AT THE COMPANY ENVIRONMENT WE KNOW. DOT IN THE SERVING LESS CHILDREN THAT HAS OBVIOUSLY IMPACTED PROVIDERS AS WELL. WRITERS REASONABLE ABLE TO HOME THIS YEAR AND THAT IS SOMETHING THEY REQUESTED FOR NEXT YEAR AS WELL USER THAT THEY HAVE ACCESSIBILITY BUT WITH SERVING LESS CHILDREN AND- SMALLER GROUPS FROM THIS IT MEANS YOU'RE BRINGING LOS RUNNING INTO THE PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE JUST. RIGHT FOR SOME OF THE CHILDREN ARE COMING IN PERSON WHAT ARE ALSO SERVING MOM AREN'T REMOTELY AND SET THAT IS ADDING ADDITIONAL COSTS. SO WELL WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY. THAT IS CLOSE WITH RETURN AND COME BACK OPEN. ARMS THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THE CRIME IS THE RIGHT NOW AS LOOK TO STABILIZE CARE TO ENSURE. AND STUFF ABOUT EARLY LEARNING HE- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING OUT SOMEONE ACCESS POINT IN YOU JUST RAISE THE NOT KNOW. I THINK IT WAS A TO COME UP LATER BUT- OF THE FACT THAT THEIR NATIONAL COSTS DUE TO SOME OF THE THINGS THE PANDEMIC HOW ARE THEY BEING COVERED IN TERMS OF SORT OF THE STATE BUDGET. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE CHILD CARE CENTERS ET ADDITIONAL COST. DEVELOPED STATE SATURDAY FIFTH DAM THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD TELL US THAT THEY WOULD COVER THEM BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE PUT OUT THE BUDGET ADDITIONAL SIGNS TO ADDRESS PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS CLEAN. HI AND THEN THEY CAN ALSO IF THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH FAST CHARGE THEM AS ELEMENTS. WE ALSO HELD HER ONCE BOTH THAT THE VOUCHER SITE ARM AS WELL AS CONTRACT INSTEAD THAT THAT DECREASE IN REVENUE WITH FAMILIES MORNING TECH ATTENDING WE WERE SHELTERING IN PLACE OR IF THEY HAD TO CLOSE IN THE CLASSROOM OR THE WHOLE PROGRAM TO THE COOKING EXPOSURE. OR BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND- REQUIRED THEM TO CLOSE THAT THEIR CONTRACT. HELP TURN THE CITY COULD STILL PAY STAFF AND THEIR BRAND THOSE BIG COST. FEATURES OF OPERATING. THE END MAYBE TO. THAT THE- IS HELL HARM MEANING THAT THEY SERVED A HIGHER NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THEIR CONTRACTORS STILL HELD IN PLACE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE SERVING LESS PEOPLE TO COVER THE COSTS THAT MIGHT COME. FROM THE PANDEMICS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. OKAY THANK YOU I WAS GONNA ASK- THE QUESTIONS FROM OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AFTER LEARNING- THE TEN AGAIN PRECIADO PRESENTATION I DID ONE DELVIN- TO FOLLOW UP WITH- THE CHAIRS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NUMBERS HERE FOR STAGE ONE TWO AND THREE. AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- IN YOUR PRESENTATIONS- BUT I GUESS YOU DON'T WANT YOUR EXPLANATIONS AND I HAVE SEEN THAT- WITH TWELVE MONTHS ELIGIBILITY YEAH YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE STAYING STAGE ONE VERSUS PROGRESS IN STAGE TWO BUT I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THE- THIS. IS TRULY MAINLY DISPLACEMENT WE WOULD SEE A LARGE INCREASE THE STAGE ONE COMMENSURATE WITH THE DECREASE IN STAGE TWO. SO BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT SO SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON- BECAUSE WE HAVE A TWO POINT FOUR ENTRIES. IN STAGE ONE FOR PROJECTED BUT THEN AT EIGHTEEN POINT 5% DECREASE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL RAW NUMBERS YOU CAN SEE ALSO THAT THE- THE ACTUAL RUN NUMBERS- THERE'S A BIG CHANGE HERE TOO. RIGHT SO EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN UP VERSUS TEN THOUSAND DOWN. SO- SO PERHAPS CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT AND ALSO I GUESS THE OTHER THING IS HE DIED IN SUB THREE WE ALSO- HAD A PRESENTATION EARLIER ON CAL WORKS. I GUESS WHEN THE QUESTIONS WHEN THE MYSTERIES I SHOULD SAY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A GOOD EXPLANATION WAS THAT THERE WAS A FALLEN CAL WORKS KNOWING THAT STAGE ONE STAGE TWO ARE. POTENTIALLY. ENTITLEMENTS FOR PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS DUE TO- EIGHT EIGHT PROJECTION THAT POWER DOESN'T GOING TO INCREASE LIKE WE THOUGHT IT WAS WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT I GUESS THAT LAMB I GUESS I'M CONCERNED THAT ONCE PEOPLE RUN OUT THEIR EMPLOYMENT SO FOURTH WE WEREN'T SURE THAT CAO WORKS WASN'T GOING TO SIR JUMPING UP. AND WHEN THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN SO- AND PERHAPS MAYBE BY MAY REVISE IT HAVE BETTER NUMBERS- BUT I THINK. THIS MAY ALSO BE PARTIALLY TIED TO THIS MYSTERY ABOUT WHY CAO WORKS HASN'T GONE UP AS MUCH IS EXPECTED AND WE NEVER GOT A REALLY GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. GEN SO CAN THERE BE A KEY PLEASE COMMENT ON. BOTH ALL OF THE DISPLACEMENT ISSUE AS WELL AS- HOW MUCH IS TO BE AFFECTED BY- POTENTIAL CHANGES AND CAL WORKS THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE ANTICIPATING- IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THERE'S A SERVER NOW FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND START AND SAY THAT I DO THINK WE AGREE THAT THE MYSTERIES THAT WE SEE ARE. ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO TEASE OUT WE DON'T HAVE EXACT DATA ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF THE POLICY CHANGES THAT HAPPEN. AND HOW THAT AFFECTS CASELOAD IN COST PER CASE SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE TRY TO TEASE OUT EVERY YEAR- AND THAT'S WHY WE WORK SO CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES FOR TO AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING AND SOMETIMES. WHAT WE SEE IN THE DATA DOES NOT REFLECT WHAT WE THINK WOULD HAPPEN AND SO WE JUST MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATES BASED OFF THAT- AND YOU ARE CORRECT IN MAY REVISION WE WILL HAVE UPDATED CASELOAD NUMBERS AN UPDATED COST PER CASE NUMBERS AS WELL. SO WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT ABOVE MORE REFINED ESTIMATE THEN- AND YEAH SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE AGREE ARE ALSO MYSTERIES THAT WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT AND WE DON'T HAVE. GREAT NUMBERS ARE. PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING THAT THE INTERACTION EFFECT OF A LOT OF THESE TWO IS REALLY. DIFFICULT FOR US TO PART. SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT AND WHAT MORE UPDATED NUMBERS IN ME. AND I GUESS THE FOLLOW UP IS IF WE HAVE GUESSED WRONG BY MAY- AND WHEN WE WILL HAVE UPDATED NUMBERS IN MAY AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT CURRENT YOUR NUMBERS LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AS WELL WE TRY TO REMAIN AS RESPONSIVE AS POSSIBLE- TO ANNIE BUDGET REVISIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN FOR THESE PROGRAMS. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM. OTHER FOLKS. SURE I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE SERLIO. R. ONE THING I DID WANT TO MENTION IS THAT IN OUR WOULDN'T LEAD YOU INDEPENDENT ESTIMATES OF COLOR CHILD CARE AND FOR STAGE ONE THIS IS YOUR KIND OF HERE REACHED ON AT THE HEART OF THE ISSUE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CONSIDER IS THE OVER ALL KIND OF WORKS AGREEMENT INTO OUR- STAGE ONE INTERSTAGE ONE ESTIMATES THAT ARE STAGE ONE ESTIMATES REALLY DO FEED INTO OUR STAGE AND STAGE TWO AND STAGE THREE ESTIMATE SO. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONSIDER WHEN WE WHEN WE CAN DOCTOR INDEPENDENT ESTIMATES AND WE COMPARE THOSE TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S I'M AS AS WE CONTINUE ALONG THIS BUDGET PROCESS OKAY SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL AS BY MAY IS MAYBE SOME SPARKLE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES I KNOW YOU DO YOUR BEST GUESS BUT SERVE A RANGE OF THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN. GIVEN WHAT YOU KNOW WEEDS SENSOR STILL BIT OF A MYSTERY ON CAL WORKS OF WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN ACCOUNT WORK SO HOPEFULLY SOMEONE'S DELVING INTO UNEMPLOYMENT DATA AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. AND LOOKING AT SAYING OKAY WELL THIS IS A RANGE OF THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN- AND- SO WE CAN IN THE- PERHAPS BETTER ANTICIPATE WHERE YOU KNOW EACH TIME YOU TEND TO GIVE US IN A NUMBER BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW GOOD IS THAT NUMBER WHAT'S THE RANGE OF PROBABILITY WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HOW WIDE IS IT IS A FAIRLY NARROW IS A FAIRLY WIDE- AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE HERE IS. THE ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM IS ALSO PROJECTED TO DROP BY NINETEEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT- I NOTE THAT TO NINETEEN TWENTY WITH FIFTY FOUR WOULD JUMP UP TO SEVENTY EIGHT DOWN THE SIXTY THREE- CAN YOU CAN THERE BE AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THAT PROJECTION WHEN THE NUMBERS GOING UP AND THEN SUDDENLY GOING NOW. PROTECTING IT'S GONNA SUDDENLY. DROP HELLO AGAIN- SO IN ORDER TO. OF SO. ON TO BE CLEAR AND ARE NOT. ON THAT WE PUT OUT FOR THE ALTERNATE PAYMENT. GROUND AND- IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET AFTER TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE WAS A BIG INCREASE IN. THE NUMBER OF VOUCHERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR. FOR EMERGENCY VOUCHERS FOR ESSENTIAL FAMILIES. AND SO THOSE VOUCHERS ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE AND THERE'S OVER. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF VOUCHERS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN OUR CASE LOW NUMBERS FOR THAT PROGRAM- IN THE- TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET YEAR- AND SO. WHEN WE TOOK THOSE OUT FOR OUR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO NUMBERS ON THE NECESSARILY LOOK LIKE THE SLOTS OF GONE GONE DOWN BUT- THE OVERALL NUMBER OF ONGOING SLOTS REMAINS THE SAME IT IS IN FACT A LITTLE BIT HIGHER WITH THE NEW PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS THAT ARE FUNDING. A NEW ALTERNATE PAYMENTS LAW. IT IS THOSE- SHORT TERM ONE TIME EMERGENCY VOUCHERS LOTS ARE NO LONGER BEING REFLECTED. OKAY SO WE'RE HOPING THAT BY JULY FIRST- WILL BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU MIGHT NOT NEED TO I REALIZE THAT THE TECHNICALLY THEY ARE ONLY IF. YOU KNOW TEMPORARY BUT THAT WE WILL NEED TO SELL AND- OR DO SOMETHING FOR THE FOLKS WHOSE- VOUCHERS ARE EXPIRING THE CENTRAL WORKERS. THAT THE SITUATION WILL BE SUCH THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER NEED THEM OR THAT. WILL MAKE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO. EVEN IF. THEY JUST DO NEED THEM THAT WE WILL BAN THEM. I THINK EVEN NOW WE'RE SEEING THAT WITH SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS ON THIS EXACT QUESTION OF. HOW TO EXTEND THE VOUCHERS AND TO BE RESPONSIVE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FIELD IN TERMS OF WHAT FAMILIES NEED AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE PANDEMIC- I KNOW WE'LL TOUCH ON WHAT'S GOING ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT- ALL THAT TO SAY THAT SOME OF THE FUND. THE FUNDS WE'RE CONTINUING TO GET FROM THE FEDS INCLUDES. DOLLARS TO EXTEND THOSE SLOTS AND I NEW SLOTS AS WELL SO THAT NUMBER WILL BE UPDATED. CONTINUOUSLY OKAY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE. ARE GENERATED- PRE THE SECOND STIMULUS TO CORRECT. RIGHT OKAY SO HOPEFULLY MAY REVISE WILL HAVE A BETTER REFLECTION WHAT THE BOTH THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS AS WELL AS STATE. FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IF I CAN GO BACK A LITTLE BIT HEALTHWORKS PART AND THAT DATA WE JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR CURRENT DATA SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO STAGE TEAM ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO COVER THE CURRENT ROMANCE BUT THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS BURKE WROTE WE ARE ANTICIPATING SOME GIRLS. THREE FUNDS INCLUDING MARKET ON X. FACTOR SUCH AS A RISE IN ELIGIBILITY. AS WE BRING MANY MORE FAMILIES LOSING THEIR INCOME AND BEING BECOMING ELIGIBLE FOR OUR- PROGRAM FACTORS SUCH AS TRANSFERS FROM EACH ONE. WE CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT STAGE ONE ESTIMATES THAT WOULD BE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT WORSE WE WOULD ANTICIPATE SOME GROWTH IN. H. U. N. HAVE ANTICIPATED. IN THE ESTIMATES THAT WE- THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW I'M IN THE MOST CENTER MCKAY SAYS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN MY AND MY QUESTIONS I THINK ARE SIMILAR. TO WHAT HAS BEEN ASKED ABOUT BUT THE ONE QUESTION I DO I JUST HAVE ON- CHILD CARE LICENSE THAT THE CLOSURES. THE ALL THOSE SLOTS THAT ARE CORRESPONDING WITH THE FACILITIES. THOSE ARE STILL BALLOTS LOTS THAT ARE OUT THERE WITHOUT ANY PLACE TO GO CURRENTLY. SORRY YOU BROKE UP JUST A SECOND YOU'RE ASKING THE QUESTION SO YOU. SO THE PERMANENTLY CLOSE SLOT SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND ALL OF THE- THE FACILITIES THAT ARE CLOSE WITH THE CORRESPONDING SLOTS THOSE ARE STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE WHERE ARE THOSE. WHERE ARE THOSE CHILDREN. I'M SO SORRY ACTUALLY- I'M SURE WHERE THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING SERVED AT THIS POINT- SOME OF THESE WERE THESE WERE ASK CHILD CARE FACILITIES THAT WERE LICENSED PRE PANDEMIC AND THOSE FACILITIES HAVE DECIDED TO COULD NOT- NOT CONTINUE ON- AS- AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THAT THEY WOULD BE PERMANENTLY CLOSED. OKAY WHICH I GUESS IS THAT THE I THINK THE ISSUE A LOT OF US ARE RAISING A THERE'S A LOT OF KIDS OUT THERE THAT WE ALL NEED OUR ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OFCARE AND ARE WE- NOT JUST COUNTING NUMBERS BY ANTICIPATING. WHERE THEY ARE AND WHEN THEY COME IN HOW DO WE HELP THEM COMMAND AND WHEN THEY DO COME IN HOW DO WE BEST. THAT TREAT THEM- IN IN IN REGARDS TO THE PREVIUS- HEARING WE HAVE A WE ASK OUR EXPERTS YOU KNOW. WHY DO YOU SEE PARTY THANK YOU SEE THIS AND I ASKED ABOUT. ARE THERE TRENDS NATIONWIDE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TO HELP US MAKE SOME PREDICTIONS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. SO FROM SOCIAL SERVICE PERSPECTIVE BUT THEN ALSO I THINK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ARE WE SEEING SOME OF THESE SAME TRENDS. ON THE CHILD CARE ISSUE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WHEN WE HOPEFULLY COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC WHICH WILL BE. ACTING CORRESPONDING WITH. WITH SCHOOL STARTING AGAIN WILL BE PREPARED. FOR THE AMOUNT OF HOPEFULLY BECAUSE WE KNOW. THE MAJORITY PEOPLE HAVE TO DROP% OUT OF THE WORKFORCE OUR. WOMEN OF COLOR CARING FOR KIDS. ONE WE'RE READY FOR THEM TO GO BACK WILL BE READY FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND WE HAVE ENOUGH SLOTS OPEN TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THEM EFFECTIVELY. WHO WAS THAT DIRECTED TO THE PART OF EDUCATION. I THINK WE'RE ALL TRACKING WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE NATION YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA RISKY EVERYWHERE AND MAKING THIS YEAR EARLIER NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT. LINA KHAN IS FOR WE ACTUALLY SEE MORE FAMILY CHILD BUSINESSES OPEN UP AND WHEN THE ECONOMY IS WRITING AND YOU'RE REALLY WELL. ACTION AND NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN GO TO OTHER BUSINESS TYPES AND MAKE WORK FUN. RIGHT NOW KNOWINGLY AS WE WALKED FIFTEEN EXTRA CARE AS WELL AS THE NEXT CENTER BASED PROGRAMS. AND MEANING TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENTS AS CARE PROGRAMS MOVING FORWARD IS SOMETHING INTERESTING DEFINITELY NOT A GOOD IN THE MASTER PLAN SO THINGS LIKE. SHARED SERVICE NETWORKS THAT CAN REALLY HELP STABILIZE AND BUILD CAPACITY THAT SOMETHING. GIRLS NEED TO DO MORE CELLS CAPACITY. I THINK THAT'S JUST THAT'S SOMETHING ALONG THE TO WORK TOGETHER ON ASKING EXPERT OUT BOTH IN THE RESOURCE SECTOR AS WELL AS IN THE CHILD CARE SECTOR. THANK YOU TO ME ARE OR ANY OF THE CHILD CARE CENTERS DOING ANY LEVEL OF- ONLINE HYBRID. I KNOW FOR THAT DEPARTMENT EDUCATION OUR DIRECT CONTRACTED PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE INFANTILE LEARN HERE AS WELL AS SCHOOL AGE CARE. PROGRAM AND ALL OF THEM ARE. IT COST THEY ALL HAVE SOME PROBLEMS DOING THAT HYBRID MODELS MAINLY BECAUSE THEIR CAPACITY REDUCE REDUCE MICHAEL AND THEY WERE THEY CAN ONLY SEE IN PERSON LAST. THEY WITHOUT REDUCE. SO LET'S SAY THEY COULD HAVE TWENTY FOUR CHILDREN OUR CLASSROOMS AND NOW CAN ONLY HAVE TWELVE TO MEET THE CURRENT STANDARDS THEY THAT ARE SERVING THE OTHER CHILDREN. A DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE SOME PROGRAMS THAT ARE FULLY CLOSE TO BEING IN PERSON BASED ON THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SCHOOL CAMPUS WILL SCHOOL CAMPUSES CLOSE. MONDAY MAY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. OKAY THAT COMMUNITY WHERE HE I'M PUBLIC HEALTH FEEL SAFE HOW CONSERVE. SUPER OF. AS TO REASONS WORKING KNOWLEDGE. IN PERSON HI BRAD AS WELL AS JUST. THANK YOU AND BECAUSE WE KNOW IN OUR LARGER PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION CENTERS THERE THEY HAVE GIVEN OUT HOT SPOTS AND DEVICES HAVE WE DONE THIS HAVE WE PROVIDED FOR THE SAME IN OUR CHILD CARE. CENTERS TO HELP THEM WITH TECHNOLOGY. YES THAT SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS HAVE PURCHASED THE QUICKNESS WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR QUALITY PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDS. I WAS ALSO SUPPORTED. BY FORCE SHE BETTER HELP CONNECTIVITY'S. FROM AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF THINGS YOU CAN IMAGINE CIRCLE TIME REMOTELY AND HAVING CHILDREN CHECK IN EVERY DAY. SO THAT THEY KEEP UP THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL. AND SPEND ONE OF THE THINGS. COGNISANT NOT HOW WAS THE FORCE AND WHEN WE KNOW THERE MIGHT BE MUCH MORE THERE CAN AND JUSTICE OF THAT SO HAPPY NOT ONGOING. ALL OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I GUESS IT WOULD WE ALL THE COME BACK TO THE POINT THE WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A GOOD DAY AND- TO MAKE THE GOOD TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MAN YEAH I WANTED TO FOLLOW ON A LESS COMMENT- ABOUT DATE I MEAN WE THERE'S COULD A FAN HERE THAT IS ON EXPLAINED THAT THAT IS CONCERNING TO US ALL AND I GUESS I'D BE INTERESTED- YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF WHEN YOU HAVE A PHENOMENON IN OTHER CONTEXTS YOU TYPICALLY YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR HYPOTHESES ARE YOU TRYING TO TEST THOSE WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMPIRICAL DATA. OUT ONE OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE COMING MONTHS TO TRY TO PIN DOWN WHAT THE EXACT ISSUES HERE ARE WHAT WHAT'S DRIVING THIS PHENOMENON OF A REDUCTION IN STAGE TWO CHILD CARE- SO L. A. L. LET ME LET ME START WITH YOU LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK WE COULD THE ADMINISTRATION CAN DO IN THE COMING MONTHS. I TO TRY TO TEST THIS IN AND TENNIS DOWN. I'M NOT SURE ACTUALLY I HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR- FOR YOU BEYOND KIND OF THE THINGS THAT I'M I'M OBSERVING THE ADMINISTRATION DOING WHICH IS- DEVELOPING. DIFFERENT DEVELOPING THESE ESTIMATES AND- YOU KNOW BRIEFING US ON THESE ESTIMATES THAT WE CAN- KIND OF TEST IN A SUIT AND- CHECK AND SEE THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE- BUT- BUT YEAH IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE YEAR WE'RE AWARE OF AND WE'RE- CONSTANTLY LOOKING INTO AND MONITORING AND OF WHAT. A WHAT THE CASE LOOKING THE CURRENT CASE IT IS LOOKING LIKE SO WE CAN. MAKE ESTIMATES OF INTO THE FUTURE BURKE FOR BUDGET YAR ESTIMATES ARE ONE OF THOSE APPROPRIATE BUY ANOTHER CONTEXT YOU MIGHT LOOK AT. BOTH QUANTITATIVE DATA AND QUALITATIVE DATA YOU MIGHT LOOK TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE. AND SEE WHAT YOU KNOW. WHY SOMEONE PERHAPS DROPPED OUT AT STAGE TWO AND DIDN'T ENROLL. YOU IN OUR THEIR PLANS UNDER WAY TO. THINK THROUGH THIS BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE A REALLY. BIG DEAL RIGHT AND SO I GUESS. YEP YOU WATER BUT MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND EDUCATION- DO YOU WHAT DO YOU GUYS PLANNING TO DO. TO TRY TO YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LARGE NUMBERS BUT THOSE ONLY GIVE YOU A PARTIAL PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON- WATER YEAR SORT OF. OTHER STEPS HERE THAT YOU THINKING ABOUT GOING. TO TRY TO. YOU KNOW IDENTIFY THE- OF. AND. WELL I CAN SPEAK OUT BRIEFLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE DON'T WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR TO GET ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION FROM OUR STAGES AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROVIDERS. AND THAT DATA HAS HELPED US UNDERSTAND SOME EMPTY BOXES AND BASICALLY ESTIMATES AROUND PAYMENTS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT MONEY IS FLOWING ONE TIME MONEY. TO OUR- AND- BUT I WILL SAY WE HAVE A PANDEMIC WE ALSO HAVE THAT TRANSITION OF ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS OVER TO SOCIAL SERVICES SO THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE HANDING THAT OFTEN HANDING OFF THAT NEED TO TRACK IT ONE THING THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD LIKE THREE IN THE PAST IS THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE STRONGEST STATE ASSISTANCE IN CALIFORNIA. TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE SENATE TRYING THE WAY WE HAVE ISSUED QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT SURGERIES SPECIFICALLY DESTINY THINGS LIKE STATE THEM THE PROVIDERS AND CONTRACTORS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GET THOSE OUT BUT I WILL SAY THERE IS A LOT OF FATIGUE SO THEY ALSO HAVE SURVEYED FIFTY GETS PART OF THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING HARDER THAN EVER THIS YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE STILL. OPERATING AND- DEMONSTRATE MADE IT THAT MUCH HARDER. AND THEN YOU ADD ON THAT. NEEDING MORE. FROM NOW AND- I WILL SAY THEY HAVE DONE QUITE A- AND- ACTORS. TO ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. YEAH THANK YOU. SENATE BOOK. YOUR MARK. GOOD MORNING. SO I HAVE A QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE VOUCHERS AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS DIRECTED TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT I'M JUST GOING TO READ REALLY QUICKLY HERE SENATE STATES THAT THE THREE STAGES OF CAL WORKS CHILD CARE AND YOU'LL TURN INTO PAYMENT PROGRAM ARE REIMBURSED THROUGH VOUCHERS AND THAT THE STATE WILL ONLY PAY UP TO THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE. WHICH AS OF RIGHT NOW IS BASED. SEE THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE IS CURRENTLY SET AT SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE OF THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. RMR SURVEY SURVEY. HOW OFTEN IS THE ORIGINAL REGIONAL MARKET RATE ARE WE EVALUATED AND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR UPDATING THIS AMOUNT IT SEEMS TO BE SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED. HI SIR BERNARD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE- THE SURVEY IS CONDUCTED EVERY TWO YEARS- TO CAPTURE THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH CHID CARE COSTS IN THE FIELD- AND- THERE THERE'S NO STATUTE THAT DOESN'T THERE'S AN INTENT BUT SAYS THAT WE WILL UPDATE TO THE MOST CURRENT RATE AND- WE CURRENTLY ARE NOT AT THE MOST RECENT SURVEY RATE- AT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN- BUT- STILL IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RATES- THROUGH. THIS BODY TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WITH OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UNION WILL WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE NOT PROPOSING ANYTHING DIFFERENT AT THIS TIME. OKAY SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY YOU SAID IT SHOULD BE REEVALUATED EVERY TWO YEARS BUT IT HAS NOT. IS THAT CORRECT. THERE'S AN INTENT TO DO SO ON THE LANGUAGE AT THE VERY LEAST- BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS THAT- IN MINISTRATION TO UPDATE IT ON TO THE TO THE MOST CURRENT ONE- SO. IT IS NOT AT THE MOST UPDATED- ARMOR SURVEY THAT THERE CURRENTLY IS RIGHT NOW. IN A NEW SURVEY IS BEING CONDUCTED AS WELL IT'S A LITTLE PUSHED OUT BECAUSE OF CO IN NINETEEN- BUT AT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY CHANGES TO THE RATES. SO JUST TO FOLLOW UP QUICKLY THERE'S AN INTENT TO DO IT BUT IT HASN'T BEEN DONE IS THAT BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YES BUT THAT'S WHAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE MARKET. THANK YOU WHY IS THAT I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS I GENERAL TROUBLE YES. NON RECOGNIZING YOU TO ASK A QUESTION REYES ALL. HER QUESTION WAS WHY IS THAT. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING SO WE DO PAY ATTENTION VERY CLOSELY UNTIL YOU KNOW THE STRUGGLE THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE CHILD CARE FIELD AND IN TERMS OF THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE ON THERE BUT A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ALIGNING THE RAIDS ABOUT MAKING A MORE EQUITABLE I BELIEVE THE MOST RECENT CHANGES THAT WE MADE HAD TO DO WITH ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FOR. INFANTS AND TODDLERS WHICH WE HEARD FROM THE FIELD HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL- AND LOCAL THE NINETEEN HAPPENED LAST YEAR TOO THERE IS EVEN MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO DO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW BEING THERE FOR THE CHILD CARE FIELD- AND PROTECTING YOU KNOW OUR FISCAL PICTURE AS WELL SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT A LOT OF THESE CHANGES ARE HAPPENING THE FIELD WAS CALLED THE NINETEEN WITH THE TRANSITION WITH DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT THE QUESTION OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE. I'M SURE WILL COME UP AGAIN IT'S MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT IN THE MASTER PLAN AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE MORE CONVERSATIONS IN THE FUTURE WILL CERTAINLY- YOU MEMBER OF THOSE AS WELL BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY CHANGES AT THIS TIME. SO MOVING FORWARD WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THESE. FEES UPDATED. SO THAT WE COULD SEE MORE EQUITY AND MORE- CONSTANT RELIABILITY IN THE FUNDING. SANTA WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TESTS YOU BUILDUP LET pTHE TWENTY SIXTEEN RIGHT NOW BUT WE DO HAVE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN REGARDING OUR- BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR TWENTY TWENTY SURVEY HAS BEEN PUSHED OUT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND SO MANY OF. THE PROGRAMS CLOSE. OPENCLOSE WE HAVE ASKED X. OF THAT DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL. AND ARE HOPING THAT THEY GRANT THAT EXTENSION WHICH MEANS WE WOULD THEN HAVE. A NEW MARKET RATE FOR. ONE FULL. MEMBERS RATE THE ADMINISTRATION JUST. DID IT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY PARKING THE TODDLER CARE I'M NOT HAS HELPED STABILIZE THAT END OF THE SPECTRUM THE PRESCHOOL RIGHT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED. YEARS SO I MENTIONED THAT EARLIER IN MY TALKING POINTS IS THAT ACTUALLY LOWER THAN THEIR REGIONAL MARKETING FOR EXEMPTS CARE PROGRAM SO WHEN YOU THINK OF. THE HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS FOR THE CALIFORNIA. LOWER AND MANY. OF LICENSE FROM. THERE'S A LOT OF INEQUITIES AS LOOK ACROSS THE FIELD IN RIGHT. SO HOW SOON CAN WE SEE IF WE WERE TO MOVE FORWARD MAKING SURE ASSURING THAT WE HAD THIS INCREASED. TO HAVE THE MOST UPDATED AMOUNT STE OF THE REGIONAL MARKET RATES. HOW SOON COULD WE SEE THAT IN EFFECT HOW LONG. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. S. SETTING OF RATES IS NOT SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS TO PROVIDE A TWENTY EIGHTEEN JOB MARKET RATE OKAY BUT THAT WOULD REALLY BE ANYA AND- I JUST PICTURE WERE- I'M ACTUALLY ADDRESSING HIGH WHAT'S OURS. I THINK- TROUBLE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THIS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S BEING INTERESTED IN THE ANSWER AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE THREE OF YOU. CAN ADDRESS HER QUESTION OF MINE THIS WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT SERVER TYPES LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M SO TYPICALLY WAY AND- THERE HAVE BEEN RATE INCREASES OF TO HAPPEN THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS I'M SURE THE LAST TIME THERE. REGIONAL MARKET RATE WAS- WAS INCREASED- THAT WAS DONE- THROUGH THE BUDGET AGREEMENT. THAT WAS PASSED AT THE END OF JUNE HAS ACTIVE JULY ONE BUT THE ACTUAL RATE CHANGE WASN'T IMPLEMENTED UNTIL- JANUARY MID YEAR WHICH GAVE THE IMMINENT- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ABOUT A SIX MONTH PERIOD TO- TO. IMPLEMENT KIND OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RATE AND HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE BIT BUT I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW. WITH ME FOR ONE BECAUSE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS. BECAUSE PART OF HER QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT IT REQUIRED LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO DO. IT SO HEY YOU JUST SAID HOW IT MIGHT BE DONE. IS THERE ENOUGH. FORTY TO DO THAT WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ACTION. SO IT WOULD REQUIRE A STATUS CHANGE YES. KILEY ACTION. TO WOULD RE. LED ACTION. AND LET ME GLEAN. FROM CENTER GROVE BOUGHT CHAU BOOKS QUESTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE US DISCUSS THAT AT SOME POINT WHEN WE GET DOWN TO DECISION MAKING YES I JUST THINK THE IT BUT THE RATES ARE. EXTREMELY UNDERFUNDED AND I THINK IT BE FAIR. FOR THE WELL BEING OF OUR KIDS AND EVERYBODY THAT'S INVOLVED. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE UP TO DATE ON THAT AND SO YES ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU TO SIX COMPLETE REQUEST YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THAT COMPLETES ISSUES. I'M SORRY- CENTER EGGMAN SAID. JUST TO MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT ON RATES AT ABU YOU'LL FIND AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM- IN CARING FOR MOST SENIOR WE HAVE SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. NOTHING SEPARATE FROM ANYTHING ELSE THANK YOU FOR MAKING THAT POINT. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO BUT BEFORE WE DO I'M GONNA MAKE ONE CORRECTION FOR THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWING AT HOME- THE PARTICIPANT NUMBER I GAVE FOR THOSE OF YOU PLANNING TO USE IT AFTER ISSUE FOR WAS NOT EXACTLY CORRECT SILVA CORRECT. DIAL IN NUMBER. IS. 844-291-6358 THE ACCESS CODE IS THE SAME I'LL REPEAT THEM BOTH BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS AFTER ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. MORE MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS IN CHILD CARE NEEDS. IT IS OUR SAME PANELISTS AS WE JUST HEARD BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT ORDER OF THIS TIME SO WE'LL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GO TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THEN GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON ISSUE NUMBER TWO. GOOD MORNING AGAIN THIS IS SERRA PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I'M GOING TO GO OVER. A VERY BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE HAVE- THAT THE STATE HAS RECEIVED TO DATE. ARE AND WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR THE CHILD CARE FEEL WHAT THOSE FUNDS AND THEN I'LL GO TO A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION ON THE BRAND NEW FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE HAVEN'T. AND THIS IS A REALLY A RECENT PROCESS AS LATE AS LAST WEEK. NOW SOME OF THESE. DOCUMENTS WERE RELEASED IN TERMS OF WHAT. IS IN STORE FOR THE NEWTON WAS FEDERAL FUNDS SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND START WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY- CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY POINT THREE MILLION FOR THE FEDERAL CARE. ACT FOR CALLED THE NINETEEN RELATED CHILDCARE ACTIVITIES- SO WITH THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION A HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION. WAS USED FOR STATE COSTS ASSOCIATED. WITH VAROUS- EXPENDITURES FROM LAST YEAR INCLUDING FAMILY FEE WAIVERS- PROVIDER PAYMENT PROTECTIONS- YOU ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS. AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT I'M A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAS USE FOR- STIPENDS. UNDER TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAS USE FOR SUPPORTING DATABASE PROVIDERS UP TO SIXTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. I WAS USED TO FUND PROVIDERS ACCEPTING THE DOCTORS AT THE MAXIMUM CERTIFIED LEVEL OF NEED. AT LEAST SIXTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION WAS FOR ONE TIME STIPENDS. FOR PROVIDERS ACCEPTING VOUCHERS THAT OFFER CARE DURING THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC- SIMILARLY IN THE HOT SUN YOU THREE MILLION WAS USED TO CONTINUE CARE FOR. HIS CHILDREN AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN EIGHT MILLION WAS USED TO EXTEND FAMILY FEE WAIVERS UNTIL JUNE THIRTY OF TWENTY TWENTY- SO THAT WAS OUR FIRST TRANCHE OF FEDERAL FUNDS. IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. IT MINISTRATION PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED TEN MILLION FEDERAL FUNDS TO CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO REIMBURSE THEM FOR THE COST. AWAY FAMILY FEES AND TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF CARE FOR CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS WITH TEMPORARY TEMPORARY VOUCHERS ON SPECIFICALLY THIRTY MILLION WAS PROVIDED. FOR THE WAY FAMILY FEES AND EMAILING WAS PROVIDED. TO EXTEND ACCESS TO CHILD CARE FOR CHILDREN. OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS- INTO ADDRESS THE INCREASED OF CARE. OFFICE AGED. IN LATE DECEMBER PASSED THE CREW RESPONSE RELEASE UP RELIEF SOME APPROPRIATE ACTS THAT INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY TEN POINT THREE BILLION CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT A CDBG CODED RELIEF FUNDS FOR CHILD CARE ON CALIFORNIA RECEIVED NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR MILLION OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS. ALSO THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING EARLY ACTION LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN THE FIELD RIGHT NOW- THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OF THAT NIGHT HER SIXTY FOUR MILLION. WILL BE FUNDED WITH FOUR HUNDRED TWO MILLION FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE RELEASED SUPPLEMENTAL ACT FUNDS- WE'RE PROPOSING TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR MILLION FOR STIPENDS FOR CHILDCARE PROVIDERS THAT ACCEPT STATE SUBSIDIES INCLUDING STATE PRESCHOOLS. STIPENDS WILL BE. FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER ELIGIBLE CHILD. EIGHTY MILLION PROVIDE MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'M SEVENTY SIX MILLION TO EXTEND THE CARE OF CHILDREN ON TEMPORARY SUBSIDIES THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ON AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ON TO ENSURE EXPEDIENT ALLOCATION OF FUNDING AND SOCKS TO PROVIDERS. AND FAMILIES- ADDITIONALLY WE ARE PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN PAID NON OPERATIONAL DAYS FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THAT ACCEPT THAT EXCEPT ST ROGERS. THESE ADDITIONAL NON OPERATIONAL DAYS WE PAID FOR WITH UNUSED CHILD CARE FUNDS PROVIDED ON THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. ADDITIONALLY FOR THE REMAINDER FUNDS OF THAT NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR MILLION- THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING ALONG WITH THE ALONG WITH CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED ON WHICH REPRESENTS CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO ESTABLISH A WORKGROUP. TO IDENTIFY THE ALLOCATION OF THE REMAINING FEDERAL FUNDS AND PRIORITIES IMPACTING THE CHILD CARE FIELD. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE OHIO. OBSERVER TED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO IN A RECENT ANALYSIS WE PROVIDED ISSUES THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER TO MOST EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH ADDITIONAL NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER OPTIONS AT THE STATE COULD IMPLEMENT QUICKLY GIVEN THE IMMEDIATE ISSUES CREATED BY THE CLUB IN NINETEEN EMERGENCY. SO THIS INCLUDES USING EXISTING PROGRAMS EXTENDING EXISTING PANDEMIC ACTIONS IN USING SIMPLE ALLOCATION METHODS TO GET FUNDS QUICKLY TO PROVIDERS THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER SPREADING FUNDS ACROSS THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO THIS INSURES A STATE CONSISTING TEMPORARY SUPPORT FOR A LONGER TIME PERIOD. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER MODIFYING. TO EASE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN EARNINGS THE EXAMPLE WE PROVIDING ALSO SAYS WEAVING FAMILY FEAST. WOULD FURTHER NOTE THAT THE FUNDING AVAILABLE IS A ONE TIME FUNDING SO DURING THE PANDEMIC THE LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIZE USING ONE TIME FUNDS TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY SLOTS FOR SOCIAL WORKERS. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PROVIDING SIMILAR FUNDING WITH THE ADDITIONAL CCTV G. FUNDING TO CONTINUE TO. PROVIDE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE FOR FAMILIES BUT WITHOUT ONGOING FUNDING HOWEVER FAMILIES RECEIVING TEMPORARY SLOTS WILL EVENTUALLY BE DISSING ROLLED. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT ON PAGE TWELVE AND YOUR AGENDA HAS A LIST OF REQUESTS FROM STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THESE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THIS INCLUDES ADDITIONAL DOCTOR SOUGHT STATE BINS WE BEGAN WITH FEES EXTENDING HOLD HARMLESS IT. BUT YOU CAN SEE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF REQUESTS IN YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE TWELVE. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

HELLO AGAIN SIR BERNARD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YES SO THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE YEAR WE'VE AND RESPONSIVE TO WHAT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION HAS BEEN SAYING- AND WORKING WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE PARTNERS AS WELL. I'M TO ADDRESS ALL THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD CARE FIELD- AND SO UP TO THIS POINT LIKE I MENTIONED MY OPENING STATEMENTS- WE WE'VE FUNDED VARIOUS DIFFERENT POLICIES BASED ON A LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS SO WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO CONTINUE THAT AND CONTINUE WORKING WITH. OUR PARTNERS. MAYBE TO SUMMARIZE WHAT YOU JUST SAID. THEY MADE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU'RE REALLY WILLING TO CONSIDER THEM RIGHT NOW YOUR RECOMMENDATION DOESN'T CONTAIN- ASCENT RIGHT. I BELIEVE THERE IS A LINE THAT WAS WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IN TERMS OF THE NEWEST AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN IN THE PROPOSAL THAT CAME OUT IN THE LANGUAGE AND WITH THE BARGAINING AGREEMENT LAST WEEK- WITH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- BUT WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM AND CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WELL. TO AND WOULD YOU PLEASE LET US KNOW- AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS OTHER BY SENATORS IT ON THE CZECH. CARE EGGMAN TO HAVE QUESTIONS SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU CHIRLA OR DEBT JUST TO CLARIFY- THE FUNDING FLOWS HERE- SO- THE FEDERAL ACTS PROVIDE NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR MILLION AND SUPPLEMENTAL- C. C. D. B. G. FUNDS. BUT WE ALSO HAD AN SP EIGHT TWENTY- TRIGGERS FOR THE FIRST THREE HUNDRED MILLION HOWEVER UNDERSTAND SOME OF THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION WAS ALREADY COVERED BY PREVIOUS FEDERAL FUNDS BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH IN TERMS OF AN OUT OF IS THE WHOLE NINE OR SIXTY FOUR MILLION WE'RE WORKING WITH IS IT. F. PART OF THAT BECAUSE THIS SB EIGHT TWENTY HOW MUCH OF THAT SO CONTINUE TO SPEAK TO. AND THEN ALSO HOW LONG FOR THE NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR MILLION IS THERE A TIME LINE WHICH WE NEED TO EXPAND THE FUNDS BY. SO CAN CAN- FINANCE EARLIER PLEASE PROVIDE SOME MORE SPECIFICITY AS TO WHAT KIND OF FUNDS ARE WE WORKING WITH HERE WITH THAT THE- WITH HR. ONE THIRTY THREE. I GUESS I THE SERVER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES. YEAH AND I CAN HELP ELUCIDATE SOME OF THE DIFFERENT PART BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING- SO TO BE CLEAR AND SB EIGHT TWENTY- THERE WAS A SECTION THAT APPROPRIATED THE DURING YOUR FIFTEEN MILLION AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER SECTION- THAT. FOR UP WITH A POSITIVE TRIGGER FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION- IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE MORE FEDERAL FUNDS- AND WE DID RECEIVE MORE FEDERAL FUNDS- IN THE FORM OF THE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION FROM. THE CORONAVIRUS REALLY pUSED FOR SOME OF THE SB EIGHT TWENTY PURPOSES- INCLUDING EXTENDING THE FAMILY FEE WAIVERS FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE FAMILY FEW WAIVERS- AND EXTENDING. ABOUT YOUR BASE LOTS. EMERGENCY VOUCHER SLOTS I'M EXTENDING ACCESS FOR THOSE PROGRAMS AND- TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE WHAT'S THERE- MY COLLEAGUE AT THE BARN EDUCATION- IS NOBLE MORGAN WAS SAYING EARLIER TO- SO THAT FUNDING NINE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DID UP HE'S A LOT OF THE NEED. FOR THOSE PURPOSES ARE OUTLINED IN SB EIGHT TWENTY SO WITH THIS BRAND NEW TRYING TO FEDERAL FUNDS ON THAT JUST CAME FROM THIS MOST RECENT ACT PASSED BY CONGRESS. WE REALIZE THAT SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR POT I WAS ALREADY A SORT OF TAKING CARE OF IN TERMS OF HAVING ENOUGH FUNDING NEEDED FOR THOSE PURPOSES OUR OUTLINED- AND SO. SOME OF WHAT WAS IN THAT LANGUAGE HARPER WASN'T A FULLY OPERATIONAL IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE FIELD AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO NOW- AND SO THE PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION I'M JUST PUT OUT. A IN TERMS OF ALL THE NW. ALL THE NEW PURPOSES FOR THE FUNDING- INCLUDING YOU KNOW THE VOUCHER THEY SLOTS EXTENDING ACCESS TO JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO- IN THE STIPENDS. AND THEN ON OPERATIONAL DAYS- BILLS- WE CREATED AND YOU KNOW IN IN DISCUSSION WITH- THE UNION AND- LISTENING TO THE VARIOUSNEEDS IN THE FIELD. AND SO THOSE ARE NOT PERFECTLY MIRROR WASN'T SB TWENTY- BUT IT IS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO WHAT THE FIELD REALLY NEEDS RIGHT NOW OKAY SO YOU SO JUST TO CLARIFY- GIVEN SB EIGHT TWENTY. AND I REALIZE THAT HE SAID THERE ARE SOME MODIFICATION. THERE ARE STILL A HUNDRED NINETY MILLION LEFT IN THAT TRIGGERED THAT WOULD BE TRIGGERED ARE WE PLAN TO SUSPEND. SB EIGHT TWENTY. THERE ARE PROPOSAL IS. IS YOU KNOW IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WAS IN THE POSITIVE TRIGGER IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE FIELD I'M JUST REALIZING THAT SOME OF. THE WAY THAT THE LANGUAGE WAS WRITTEN MADE IT SO THAT IT ONE AND ALLOW US TO. EXPEDITE SOME OF THSE FUNDS AS QUICKLY AS THE FIELD WOULD NEED- TO ADDRESS US. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE- CONSEQUENCES OF THE GROUP IN NINETEEN CAN TO MAKE AND SO THIS PROPOSAL- IN THIS EARLY ACTION LANGUAGE. I'M GETS OUT MORE OF THE PATH OF THE PACKAGE THAT ALLOWS US TO GET FUNDS OUT QUICKLY RIGHT NOW SO OKAY. WE DIDN'T QUITE ANSWER MY QUESTION SO. WE'RE SUBSTITUTING A NEW SO WE HAVE A HUNDRED. IF IN LESS I GOT MY MATH WRONG WE HAVE A HUNDRED NINETY MILLION LEFT IN THE S. B. A. TWENTY TRIGGER POSITIVE- AND SO. WE'RE YOUR IN YOUR PROPOSAL YOUR PLANE TO SAY NO WE TURN THAT OFF WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE RIGHT OR WE ARE DOES THAT SB EIGHT TWENTY TRIGGER STILL CONTINUE. FOR THE REMAINING HUNDRED NINETY MILLION. YES SO THE NEW FUNDING DOES NOT DOES NOT PERFECTLY TAKE FROM THE LANGUAGE OF SB EIGHT TWENTY OKAY. ALL RIGHT AND THEN THE OKAY SO WERE OKAY AND THEN D. NINE UNDER SIXTY FOUR MILLION WHEN DO WE HAVE TO EXPAND THAT BY HIS DISCO UNTIL WHEN. THE NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR TO BE GOT FROM H. R. ONE THIRTY THREE AS OUR TIMELINE ON THAT OR IT'S A BLOCK GRANT SO I PRESUME IS THERE A TIME WE HAVE TO SPEND IT BY ACCORDING TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YES IF YOU LIVE ANY TO BE SPENT. ABOUT OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW- IMMEDIATELY- I MISS NO MORE AND I DON'T KNOW IF FROM CITY REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD. YEAH. I'M ALSO SIR BUT HE WAS PARTNER I THINK IT'S AT TYPICALLY WE HAVE THREE YEARS TO GET THROUGH THE FUNDS BUT I AM TRYING TO GET THE FINAL NUMBER. SO YOU CAN YOU CAN GET BACK TO ME ON THAT AND OKAY BECAUSE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT SOME OF THIS IS WE WANT TO BE SURE WE MEET THE NEED THAT PURPOSE OF THE MONEY. ALSO YOU KNOW TRYING TO AVOID CLIFFS AND SO FORTH THAT MAY HAPPEN- SO KNOWING WHAT THAT TIME LINE IS BECAUSE ALSO IN. SOME SENSES WHEN THIS MONEY RUNS OUT.

OF EXCEL WOULD BE HELPFUL TO. BUT DIAGRAM. PERHAPS OF HEALTH THIS THAT OUT HOW THE MONEY'S GOING TO GO. AND THEN IN TERMS OF AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT- MAIN THE THINGS. THAT WOULD PUT FORWARD IN THE- MO YOU BUT TO HAVE IT DO YOU HAVE AN EXPENSE FOR. THE- THINK WHAT'S BEEN AGREED TO IN THE M. O. U. SO HOW MUCH HOW MUCH OF HOW MUCH IS THAT GOING TO COST.

CLEAR IT'S- IT'S A HUNDRED FORTY FOUR MILLION WILL BE PROVIDED TO VOUCHER BASED PROGRAMS AND THE GENERAL CHILD CARE PROGRAM FOR THE STIPENDS AND A HUNDRED MILLION- TO THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR SITE PLANS- AND I APOLOGIZE IN THE- AGREEMENT. ON IT JUST INCLUDES THE STIPENDS FOR- WHAT IS BEING BARGAINED WITH THE FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME PROVIDERS UNLESS EXAM PROVIDERS SO. THAT WOULD JUST BE THE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR MILLION- AND THEN BE. ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN PAY NON OPERATIONAL DATA- AND SO THOSE COSTS ARE BEING ABSORBED WITHIN UNUSED CHILD CARE FUNDS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. OKAY HOW MUCH.

A LITTLE BIT MORE AND I'VE SOME DETAILS SURROUNDING A SURROUNDING THE TRANSITION ACTIVITIES THAT WE'VE ENGAGED IN TO DATE. IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH CD.

THOSE PROGRAMS WILL BE JOINING THE STAGE ONE HOW WORKS HOW CARE PROGRAM THE EMERGENCY CHILD CARE BRIDGE PROGRAM FOR FOSTER CHILDREN. AS WELL AS THE CHILD CARE LICENSING PROGRAM AND A NUMBER OF NUTRITION PROGRAMS INCLUDING CALFRESH THAT. ARE ALREADY ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER WITH C. D. E. AND ALSO SOLICITING QUITE A BIT OF FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS IN THE FIELD. AND THROUGHOUT THAT- FALL AND- INTO THIS WINTER- WE HAVE STIRRED UP A DEDICATED PUBLIC WEBPAGE- IT WAS LAUNCHED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND IT ALLOWS- AND ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO REST REFORMS IT ALSO HAS OFFERED SURVEYS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH.

WE HAVE ALSO HELD QUARTERLY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ABIT HAVE ALLOWED INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE UPDATES- AND THAT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO INVITE INPUT. AND WE HAD THREE QUARTERLY MEETINGS THUS FAR WITH OVER A THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS. WE HAVE ALSO HELD TOPICALLY SPECIFIC TO OUR LISTENING SESSIONS ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT DURING THE TRANSITION AND BEYOND- IN ORDER TO ENSURE NO DESTRUCTION AND TO INSURE THAT WE ARE CAPTURING OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE UPON- THE STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM THAT ALREADY EXIST. THOSE INCLUDED TOPICS SUCH AS CONTRACTS THE ISSUES IMPACTING RURAL AREAS IN PARTICULAR EQUITY AND WHOLE CHILD WHOLE FAMILY APPROACHES TO MEETING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES NEEDS. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL LISTENING SESSIONS PLANNED COMING UP AND HAVE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM SO MANY PEOPLE. IN THOSE FORMS. VETERANS ACTIVITIES TO DATE HAVE ALSO INVOLVED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PARTNERSHIP IN CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN CDSS AND CD. OUR TEAMS ARE IN TOUCH ON A DAILY BASIS WE HAVE DAILY WEEKLY AND MONTHLY MEETINGS- THE TOPIC AREAS THAT WERE FOCUSING ON- EVERYTHING FROM FACILITIES AND SPACE PLANNING. YES S. BUILDINGS AND- BUT JUST A GOAL- ACTIVITIES WE ALSO HAVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BOTH TO SUPPORT THE STAFF AND TO SUPPORT THE OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM'S. CONTRACTS REGULATIONS FISCAL POLICY DEVELOPMENT. HUMAN RESOURCES AND LABOR RELATIONS IF SOMEBODY'S IN LICENSING AND OUT OF THEIR AUDITING MONITORING AND PROGRAM INTEGRITY. CITY HAS PROVIDED TO CDSS REALLY DETAILED WALKTHROUGHS TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE WORK FLOW AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION ON JULY FIRST AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO DISTRACTIONS SYSTEM. BETWEEN AB CD AND STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE ALSO RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF INPUT ABOUT LONGER TERM OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRENGTHENING THE SYSTEM AND MAKING SOME OF THE KINDS OF CHANGES THAT DIRECTOR JOHNSON REFERENCED WITH RESPECT TO OUR INTENT. TO SERVE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH THE QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM. THAT WILL COMPREHENSIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT. THEIR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE SO- WITH THAT I WILL STOP AND WE DO ALSO HAVE OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER SALINAS CHILD I'M HERE WITH US AND THEY THINK SHE'S PREPARED AS WELL TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA IF THAT IS WHERE THE CHAIRS- WOULD LIKE TO DO NEXT. THE WORLD AND IT BACK TO YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO QUESTIONS AFTER EVERYBODY IS PRESENT. SO IS THERE ANYTHING. ELSE FROM YOU BEFORE WE MOVED TO THE- ARBON OF EDUCATE. I DON'T THINK UNLESS CAMERA HAS ELSE TO ADD IN THIS INTRODUCTORY THANK YOU MOVE TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING AGAIN. SHARES MEMBERS THERE NEVER MORGAN ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. OVER THE LAST YEAR'S CD HAS BEEN DEEPLY COORDINATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO DETERMINE HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE TRANSITION WHILE ALSO MINIMIZING DISRUPTION TO THE PROGRAM CONTRACTORS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. DESPITE NOT RECEIVING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IS CDS COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT TIME AND ATTENTION TO SUPPORTING THE TRANSITION I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY CALL OUT SOME PIECES THAT ARE CD EIGHTEEN HAS DONE AROUND. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF WORK NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE TRANSITION. IN SOME INSTANCES OUR STAFF HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO A 3240% INCREASE IN WORKLOAD TO REALLY ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS IN THE PLAN WHILE ALSO ADDRESSINGTHE PRIORITIES RELATED TO THE BAND DAMAC AND. GETTING ADDITIONAL FINDS OUT TO THE FIELD. OVER ARCHING ME WE HAVE SHARED. F WITH INVENTORIES. AND FUNCTIONS AND HOSTED SEVERAL DOZEN MEETINGS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CDSS TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AND SYSTEMS TRANSITIONING. MORE SPECIFICALLY WE'VE DEVELOPED MATERIALS FOR ENJOYING THAT PRESENTED AT MORE THAN SIXTY CREE NEEDS WALK THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND FOLLOW UP MEETINGS. IDENTIFIED DEVELOPED AND SHARED ABOUT A THOUSAND FILES THAT INCLUDE PROCEDURES MANUALS PROCESS THESE. CHARTS TRAINING ANY COMPREHENSIVE TRANSITION INVENTORY. IS INVENTORY IDENTIFIES AND DESCRIBES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE SERVICES AND FUNCTIONS AND INCLUDES OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE ATTACHMENTS OUTLINING PROCESS SEES AND RESOURCES. WOULD ALSO IDENTIFY TWELVE AREAS WHERE AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT OR MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING MAY BE NEEDED. TO ENSURE TRANSITIONS SUCCESSFUL HOST JULY FIRST ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. SAYS MAY NOT BE READY TO FULLY IMPLEMENT IN TERMS OF DATA SYSTEMS PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND OTHER CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION WE'VE COLLABORATED AND CONTRIBUTED TO THAT TRANSITION PLAN THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS DRAFTING AS WELL AS THEIR TO QUARTERLY. TRANSITION REPORTS TO DATE. AS WE WORK THROUGH THE TRANSIT TOGETHER WITH THAT DEPARTMENT SOCIAL. THERE ARE SEVERAL HE ISSUE AREAS WHERE DECISIONS STILL NEED TO BE MADE AND PROVIDED THEM WITH THE KEY DECISION DOCUMENT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE KNOW THOSE ARE PRIORITIES IN OUR MEETINGS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS THAT WE REALLY CAN ADDRESS THE KEY CRITICAL AREAS AROUND HUMANS AND HOW TO ENSURE PAYMENTS HAPPEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRANSITION. WE ALSO WANNA FLAG ANOTHER AREA RESTORE DRESSING AROUND QUALITY PLANS INSURANCE AT WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION. WE KNOW THAT YES HE WILL CONTINUE TO NEEDED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO ADDRESS THE CHILD ASSESSMENT COMPONENTS AND HELPING US. INSURE THAT SUPPORT COMMUTING TO G. K. AND BE PART OF A TRANSITION AND UPDATING THE PRESCHOOL LEARNING. FOUNDATIONS AND OTHER RESOURCES. ANOTHER CHALLENGE WE KNOW THE OUR- IS PENDING THAT WERE REALLY WORKED OUT A LONG. THROUGH MULTIPLE. BUT APART OF FINANCE IN WITH CDS THAT. IS A VEHICLE TO ALLOW FOR COUNTRY TRANSFERS BETWEEN THE GENERAL CHILD CARE CTR PROGRAMS AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. AND FINALLY THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT MOVING PROGRAMS IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR WHICH ENDS SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH AND THE NECESSARY YEAR AND ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THAT BOTH DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE THE EXPENDITURE DATA. FOR ONE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR AND WE NEED YOUR AND CLOSING OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AROUND THAT FOR THE STATE CONTROLLED THE- COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. AS WELL AS REQUIRED FEDERAL. REPORTING SO AS YOU CAN HEAR THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES AS PART OF A TRANSITION THAT WE ARE ALL STILL WORKING DILIGENTLY ON. AS WE WATCHED UCLA. OWES REPORT AROUND SEVENTY MODIFIED APPROACHES AROUND THIS WE DO SHARE SOME SIMILAR CONCERNS TO THE L. A. L. ABOUT CONTINUING THE TRANSITION. AS CURRENTLY PLANNED ESPECIALLY AROUND ISSUES RELATING TO THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STATE PRESCHOOL AND THE GENERAL CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS THE CHILD AND ADULT CARE PROGRAM. OVERALL DIRECT CONTRACTED PROGRAMS- YOU MINISTERED VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM THE VOUCHER PROGRAMS AND YOU HAVE TO MEET EDUCATION AND QUALITY STANDARDS. THIS TRANSITION OF BIPARTITION. CREATES CREATES A BIFURCATION ACROSS OUR DIRECT. SERVICE BROWN'S. I NEED A CD HAS SUCCESS YOU MAY. SEVEN BEDROOM TRADE NUTRITION YOUR PROGRAM INCLUDING THAT IN A CARE PROGRAM WHICH ONLY PLAN. FOR COMPLYING COMPLEX FEDERAL. AND MANDY. SESSION WILL IMPACT BOTH THE OPERATE IN THE SERVER. WITH THAT DEFEAT RELY AND EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION AN ONGOING STATE GENERAL FUND TO CONTINUE ADMINISTERING THE SIX REMAINING CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS AT CD. AS WE FOLLOW THIS TRANSITION CD WILL NEED SIGNIFICANT STAFF RESOURCES TO CONTINUE CURRENT LEVELS OF SUPPORT TO CONTRACTORS I WOULD ACTUALLY BE MODIFIED LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR MANY PROGRAMS WILL BE TRANSITIONING TO CD ACCESS. AS WELL AS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CETINA AND MARK ADMINISTERING THOSE EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS CITY WILL ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT 90% OF ITS CURRENT EARLY LEARNING AND CARE CONTRACTORS SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE CONTRACTORS DOWN FROM THE SEVENTY FIVE. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY NINE WE CURRENTLY START BECAUSE THEY HOLD CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM CONTRACTS SIMILARITY OF THE THREE OVER THREE THOUSAND LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND CONTRACTORS THAT OPERATE OUR FEDERAL CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS WE WILL STILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT TWO THOUSAND OF THEM. AND BECAUSE OF THE OTHER MEAL PROGRAMS. ASIAN TRANSFERRING TO THE DEPARTMENT ESTO SERVICES I'VE REALLY BEEN IDENTIFIED DUE TO FUNDING AND FUNCTION. AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE MOVING OVER ARE FUNDED BY FEDERAL CRIMES SUCH AS THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK FIND. BETTER SYSTEM HASN'T BEEN INVESTED IN SUPPORTING THE STATE ADMINISTRATION AND THINGS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. IN ADDITION BECAUSE MANY CONTRACTORS WILL HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES MOVING FORWARD. DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE NEW WORKFLOW I RELATED TO CORD MY- DATA SHARING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND THAT ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED C. H. YES P. R. AND CHILD AND ADULT CARE FOOD CONTRACTORS NEEDING TO CDSS. 32% ALSO OPERATE ANOTHER OF OUR CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS JUST SHOWING YOU SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTING OF COORDINATION THAT WILL HAVE TO ENSURE HAPPENS. AS WE ADDRESS MONITORING ACROSS TO AGENCIES DATA COLLECTION AND PROVIDING SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACROSS THIS THEME PARTNERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWING THAT LAST ANALYST THANK YOU AND THEN WILL MOVE TO THE COLAIO. MORNINGS ARE HAS ANALYSTS OFFICE I'M SO JUST A QUICK REMINDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO SHIFT THREE BILLION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE TO CD. OR DVD TO DS US ON THE BUDGET ALSO SHIFTS THIRTY TWO MILLION IN STATE OPERATIONS FROM CD ETS OF BOTH OF THOSE AT BOTH OF THOSE ACTIONS WOULD BE COST NEUTRAL. ON THE LASTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES THIRTEEN MILLION OF NEW FUNDING- ONGOING FUNDING TO BACK FILL SOME OF THE POSITIONS BEING PROPOSED TO TRANSFER TO THE FROM CD ETS SO THOSE WOULD BE BACK FILL POSITIONS ACCEDI- SO THE ADMINISTRATION NOTES IT WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT STAFF TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAMS REMAINING AT CD EVEN THE LEVEL OF STATE. OPERATIONS BEING SHIFTED. I'M SO WE HAVE A COMMENTS REGARDING PROPOSED. SO WE WOULD KNOW THAT TODAY SEVERAL ELEMENTS OF THE TRANSITION PLAN THAT ARE STILL LACKING SOME- SOME KEY DETAILS. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE FULL COST OF THE TRANSITION REMAIN UNCLEAR AS A STUDY MINISTRATION- NOTED IT'S CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE RESOURCES AND STAFFING NEEDED- WE ALL WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE COSTS WE ARE AWARE OF SO THE THIRTEEN MILLION A NOTED TO BACK FILL POSITIONS THAT CD EAT. ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED GIVEN THAT EXCEED THAT EXCEEDS THE COST OF THE PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WITHDREW LAST YEAR DUE TO COST CONCERNS AN OX. ASSEMBLY REFERRING TO THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS- THE PROPOSAL SHIFTED TO GO UNDER DSS. FOR AT THE COST. DUE TO COST CONCERNS- AND THEN SELECTING NO REGARDING THE CALL OF THE- IS THAT THE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATION BUT JUST HAVING THAT ADMINISTRATION HAPPENED WITHIN A DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENT THE COSTS ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS TO STATE LEVEL ADMINISTRATION. THE WE RECOGNIZE THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THIS TRANSITION AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PACKAGE GIVEN THE INFORMATION WE KNOW SO FAR THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO RECONSIDER CONTINUING WITH THE TRANSITION. AS PLANNED AND HAD SEVERAL OPTIONS MOVED TO MOVE FORWARD. THE FIRST OPTION IS TO STOP THE TRANSMISSION SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE THAT TRANSITIONING CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND THE C. A. C. F. HE THE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM- TO DS US IS NO LONGER A PRIORITY. SO THIS WOULD FREE UP THIRTEEN MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THE SECOND OPTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE TO DELAY THE TRANSITION. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO FOCUS THE ENTIRE ATTENTION ON THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. AND PLAN FOR THE TRANSITION ON THE SLOWER TIME LINE WEEDING DELAYING THE TRANSITION UNTIL A YEAR AFTER THE COUP IN NINETEEN OR AGENCY DECLARATION AS AND IT WOULD BE A REASONABLE APPROACH. ON THE IN THE THIRD OPTION WOULD BE TO MODIFY THE SCOPE OF THE TRANSITION. THE LEGISLATURE COULD REDUCE THE NUMBER O POSITION OF NUMBER PROGRAM SHIFTING TO DS US. IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES DECIDE TO TAKE THIS APPROACH WE RECOMMEND KEEPING THE C. A. C. F. P. THE NUTRITION PROGRAM THAT'S BEING PROPOSED TO MOVE AT CD- KEEPING NOT PROGRAM THAT. SO AND THAT'S GIVEN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FUNDING. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SHIFTING THIS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY. THE LEGISLATURE COULD FURTHER MINIMIZES SCHOOL OF THE TRANSITION MY ALSO SHIFTING. CERTAIN CHILD CARE PROGRAM CITY EXCESS OF THIS LIKE JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE- MOVING POWER STAGES TWO AND THREE- AND HAVING THE REST OF THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS MAINTAIN THAT CD. AND TAKING A SMALLER SET OF PROGRAMS COULD BE MORE MANAGEABLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AT THIS TIME. WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE DOES DECIDE TO DO- WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS MAINTAINING THE SAME LEVEL OVERSIGHT CURRENTLY HAS. WE HAVE SOME SPECIFIC MORE TECHNICAL ORIENTED- RECOMMENDATIONS- IN OUR ANALYSIS TO THIS AND- THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL I JUS HAVE ONE QUESTION TO LEAD WITH TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- WE JUST HEARD THAT. OUR CAN. OF THE TRAIN. AND EVERY SPEAKER TO ABOUT THE MECHANIC OF THE TRENDS. NO WAY SORT ADDRESS WHETHER YOU THINK IT'S ALL GOING TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN THE TIME FRAME ABOUT THE- SWITCH OF THE FISCAL YEAR COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT. SURE AND YES WE ARE ON TRACK TO HAVE THE TRANSITION OCCUR AT JULY FIRST A COUPLE THINGS APPOINT OUT HERE IN TERMS OF THAT MORE DETAILED. A SPECIFIC SET OF THE TRANSITION PLAN WE ARE ON SCHEDULE TO PROVIDE THAT ACCORDING IN ACCORDANCE TO THE STATUTORY DEADLINE OF THE END OF MARCH SO THAT WILL BE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE AT THE END OF. MARCH AND AS- UNDERSTANDABLE MORGAN ADMISSIONS AT THAT STAGE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION IS ALSO SUPPORTED AT THE DEVELOPMENT AT THAT PLANS OF THE SPECIFICS. ADD THE POINTS ALSO MADE OUT BY THE SEVERAL WORK AND OUT THERE ARE COMPONENTS OF FOR EXAMPLE YEAR IN CLOSE OUT OF FISCAL BOOKS THAT MIGHT BE HONEST FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR CYCLE EXCEPT IRAQ. WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THOSE DETAILS RIGHT NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS TO WHAT THINGS NEED TO BE CLOSED. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT POTENTIALLY WILL. HAPPEN POSTED JULY ONE AND I AM IN WHICH THINGS WERE IMMEDIATELY- SB TRANSITIONING OVER. PART OF- THE SIMPLE MORGAN'S COMMENTS RELATED TO SOME OF THE CONTRACTORS THAT THE MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS ABOUT. CERTAINLY IMPACT THE DATA SYSTEM SO IN SOME CASES WHAT WILL BE CHIU ESSENTIALLY USE ONE SYSTEM YOU KNOW HOW. PROVIDES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ALSO TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM SO AGAIN. WE ARE A LEADING ANY BURDENS ON THAT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS. OF COURSE OVER TIME- ALSO LOOKING TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THOSE DATA SYSTEMS INCORPORATE THEM INTO OUR LARGER. FAMILY ADDS AS A SYSTEMS AND PROGRAM SO YES TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. WE ARE PLANNING ON PROCEEDING WITH CITY AND JULY ONE TRANSITION WITH THOSE AT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONAL POINTS IN THE INFORMATIONAL. POINT GREATLY ASSISTED. SO THINGS DON'T MATCH EXACTLY THE STAY FIRST YEAR. END YOU WOULD. TO DO TO THE END OF THE FIRST. FOR FISCAL. ENDS THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN DONE BUT THAT'S JUST ALL PART OF THE EXPECTED TRANSITION THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE ON JULY FIRST IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU- CHAIR EGGMAN. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH TIME. AND I GUESS JUST ON REFLECTION EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT RECENTLY HAS HAS LED US TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS OUT THERE THAT WE DON'T KNOW QUITE WHERE THEY ARE BOTH IN IN OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM AS WELL AS OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM IN CALIBRATION CAL WORKS RIGHT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE MOST AT RISK. COMMUNITIES AND INTO IT IN LIGHT OF. DO SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS DO DO YOU DO WE REALLY THINK NOW IS THE TIME IN THE MIDDLE THE PANDEMIC TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM. AND DO EVEN REALLY HAVE TIME TO DO IT IN CONTRACTING. THAT PROCESS TO BEGIN IN MARCH WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET IN ORDER TO BE IN EFFECT IN JULY. SO AGAIN GIVEN. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC WITH SO MANY CHILDREN UNACCOUNTED FOR RIGHT NOW. DO WE PRACTICALLY THANK I MEAN WHAT IS A LOT OF DESCRIBING BUT DO WE PRACTICALLY THINK. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS IS THIS IS THE BEST PATH TO MEET THE NEEDS MOST EFFECTIVELY. DEPARTMENTS OF SERVICES. YES THERE INCREASED APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND AGAIN AT WE ARE WE ARE ON TRACK AND THEY WANT TO JUST AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRANSITIONAL YIELD IN TERMS OF CONNECTION TO SOME OF THE BEST PROGRAMS IN THE GREATER RATE THAT SHE MENTIONS THAT WE ARE ON TRACK AND WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT AT THE IMMEDIATE TRANSITION BUT ALSO LOOK FOR THOSE AT PROGRAM POLICY IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME ALTERNATE OVER TO OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER SELINA CHOW SKEET SPECIFICALLY.

AND FISCAL CLOSE OUT OF THOSE CROSS IN SOME CASES AT THE STATE FISCAL YEAR AND SOME OF RUN A FEDERAL FISCAL CYCLE. SO AGAIN WE ANTICIPATE BACK AT THE CLOSING OF THE BOOKS IF YOU WILL WILL OCCUR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS OPPOSED TO HAVING YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF MONTHS REMAINING. TRANSFERRING THAT JULY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD OCCUR. HOUSE JULY IN STAYED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OTHER CONTRACTING PEACE AGAIN WE WANT THAT WORK ITS PRE WORK IF YOU WILL AGAIN PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE BUDGET. IN TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE CHANGES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING WORKED ON REAL TIME WE WOULD OUTLINED. IN I WOULD JUST SAY AGAIN THAT BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING AND AGAIN BASED ON ALL ENGAGE THAT WE'VE HAD ACROSS. THE STATE ABOUT COMMITMENT OF OURSTO ABSOLUTELY AVOID ANY DISRUPTION SERVICE WE GET RECOGNIZE ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC HOW CRITICAL. AT THIS SUPPORT IS FOR FAMILY SO THAT IS THAT PERSON FOR. OUR PRIORITY TO ENSURE THAT SEAMLESS AND SMOOTH AND- AND WE'RE ON TRACK TO DO THAT SO. AGAIN THAT THE EXAMPLES I GIVE YOU ARE ARE RELATED TO HER REPORTING FISCAL CLOSE OUT STARTING TODAY SO I GUESS JUST A FOLLOW UP I MEAN. YOU KNOW I THINK OF THIS ALMOST LIKE AND IN A CONTEXT THERE'S COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF CORPORATIONS THAT DECIDED BUY ALLEN REQUIRE OR MERGE WITH OTHER COMPANIES- ON PAPER IT LOOKS GREAT THEY'RE ABLE TO BLEND THEIR OPERATIONS. ON ON THE BALLOT SHEETS. BUT THEIR CHALLENGES AND I GUESS WHAT I'M SEEING AND HEARING HERE IS THAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING A LOT OF CHALLENGES- YOU KNOW IF WE LOOK TO OUR BUSINESS SCHOOL COUNTERPARTS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TYPICALLY GETS IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO SUCCESSFUL BLENDING OF OPERATIONS IS. CULTURE AND I GUESS I'D BE INTERESTED. IN BOTH THE CITY AND CDSS. DESCRIBING IF YOU THINK THEIR CULTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. THE TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT PRESENT SOME CHALLENGES AS FAR AS INTEGRATING. STAFF AND OPERATIONS. SURE GLAD GLAD TO ANSWER IS ONE SAFE USE. HERE IN TURN ADDS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION'S LONG STANDING HISTORY OF WORKING TOGETHER ON THESE PROGRAMS AS YOU HEARD. A DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHOI AND MENTIONED THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HAS BEEN ADMINISTERING CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR MANY MANY YEARS. CALYXT H. ONE B. EXAMPLE BUT SHE LISTED OTHERS IN TERMS OF THE EMERGENCY CHILD CARE BRIDGE. FOR FOSTER FAMILIES ETCETERA BUT THERE HAVE BEEN. COUNTLESS I WOULD SAY. INTERAGENCY WORKGROUPS. AND TO THE COURSE OF THIS CAN AND SO OF THE REAL THAT BEEN OUTLINED IN OUR TWO. THIS MORNING I WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION ON THOSE IN AND AGAIN WARNING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE FAMILIES FOR EXAMPLE. EXPERIENCING THE COW WORKS AT THREE STAGES OF CHILD CARE ARE THOSE SAME FAMILIES THAT WOULD TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR POLICIES ARE ALIGNED. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT TIGHTENING OF DELIVERABLES EXCEPT IRAQ AT THOSE THINGS WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER. ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP AND SO- CERTAINLY AGAIN THE PRIORITIES THAT I OUTLINED AT THE BEGINNING FOR THE DEPARTMENT RELATED TO ADDRESS INEQUITIES RELATED TO DATA DRIVEN OUTCOMES. IN RELATED TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT I WOULD SAY ARE SHARED ACROSS THE DEPARTMENTS. TO GET A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN THAT SPACE OVER TIME TOGETHER- IT ESPECIALLY IT LIFTED UP YOU'LL SEE AGAIN I THINK THAT DETAIL. OUTLINED IN SOME OF THE APPROACHES THAT I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ADDRESS RELATED TO HOW THEY'LL ALSO BE EMBEDDED IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM SO I GUESS JUST A FOLLOW UP TO REALLY QUICKLY I MEAN. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WORK TOGETHER YOU HAVE A COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP I GUESS MY QUESTION IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WHICH IS IN I DON'T I'VE NEVER STEPPED IN YOUR OFFICES I. DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW YOU OPERATE ON I'M JUST CURIOUS ARE THEIR CULTURAL DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN YOUR DIFFERENT OFFICES- THAT MIGHT PRESENT ANY KIND OF CHALLENGE AND I THINK I'M HEARING YOU. KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE BUT I. MAY YOU COULD JUST CLARIFY. YEAH AGAIN I WOULDN'T SPEAK TO THE CULTURE OF THE PART THAT I WILL DO. THAT TO MICHAEL. AND I TERMS OF THE WORK IN THE- IS THAT WE HAD ON. A DRESS SYSTEM CHANGES I WE HAVE DONE A LOT. AND SPACE AGAINST GET CAN TO MAKE. AS THEY GO. OTHER DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN MEETING ON A MONTHLY BASIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STAFF WHO ARE GOING TO BE MOVING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ENSURING THAT THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE ARE ADDRESSED AT THE UNDERSTAND WHAT TO EXPECT. WHAT IS THEIR DAY ONE LOOK LIKE. A HOW WILL ANY KIND OF- SATELLITE THE REGIONAL OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE THEIR LOCATION CHANGE THAT WE HAVE MADE A- VERY INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO ENGAGE THE STAFF THAT ARE IMPACTED. AND MAKE SURE THEIR QUESTIONS ARE DRESSED IN IN ANDERSON WHAT. TO EXPECT AS THE TRANSITION OCCURS. DID YOU. JOHN RESPONSE I'VE HAD IT MY BE HELPFUL. SHARE THE COMMITTEE. AND THAT IS A OF THOSE- MONTHLY IN. AND THEN IT JUST WE DO ALSO SAY. THE CD STAFF WOULD BE TRANSITION OVER. THE OF SOCIAL SERVICES- ABOUT THEIR HOPES AND CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSITION AND WHAT WE HEARD BACK WAS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF RESPONDENTS EXPRESSED EITHER NEUTRAL. OR POSITIVE FEELINGS ABOUT THE TRANSITION SO SIXTY PERCENT. NEUTRAL AND 15% THAT WERE POSITIVE. AND THE REMAINING 25% HAD QUESTIONS. OR CONCERNS AND IT WAS HELPFUL TO US TO HEAR SOME MORE ABOUT THAT. IN OUR ON GOING MONTHLY ENGAGEMENT. FORUM AND IN THE DAY TO DAY WORK GROUPS WE COULD MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS FROM THAT- SMALLER NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO HAPPEN. AND JUST AS A FOLLOW. UP WHEN WAS A SURVEY TAKEN. I IT WAS NOVEMBER TWO TWENTY NOVEMBER OKAY. AND CITY. THANK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SOME MORE SIMONET GO BACK ONE STEP JUST TO SAY THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH CDSS ON SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON ESPECIALLY THE CHALLENGES AROUND PAYMENTS AND ENSURING THE CLOTHES OUT AND APPROPRIATIONS THEY WOULD BE IN THE TRANSITION OVER NDSS THIS PROJECT BUT SEAT BUT OBVIOUSLY IF WE CONTINUE WITH PAYMENTS WOULD NEED SOMETHING IN OUR BUDGET AS WELL WE ALSO WOULDN'T HAVE THE STAFF TO DO SOME OF THE FEDERAL CLOSE OUT. YEAH ALL THE STAFF TRANSITIONS AND THERE ARE SOME NUANCES ARE LIKE THE NITTY GRITTY COMPONENTS OF WHERE STAFF ARE AND WHERE'S THE FUNDING APPROPRIATION THAT DIVE INTO THAT JULY TIME PERIOD THAT YOU WE FLAGGED AS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT MORE CLOSELY THERE ARE ALSO SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DATABASE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE ESPECIALLY AROUND THINGS LIKE THE PAYMENTS AND IN REGARDS TO THE CULTURE WE WOULD SAY JUST ASK- WHAT CAN. ART DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND HIS TRAVIS I'D BOTH DEPARTMENTS ARE VERY COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES I THINK THERE'S A SHARED PASSION AND COMMITMENT TO THE FIELDS THERE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS OPERATED EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS SINCE WORLD WAR TWO SO FAR OUR CULTURE IT REALLY IS THAT FROM BIRTH IT'S PART OF AN EDUCATIONAL CONTINUE M. AND WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON EARLY ADD AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT NARROWING OR PREVENTING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. SO PEOPLE COME AND BE COMMITTED TO EDUCATION AS PART OF THE WAY IT IS IN SO I WOULD SEE THE CITY CULTURE THAT'S UNIQUE ACROSS STATE AGENCIES IS THAT LESS PEOPLE LEAVE THEY'RE DRAWN TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR SPECIFIC REASON AND THERE'S LESS BOUNCING AROUND TO GET SPECIFIC JOB COMPONENTS THEY HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND MASTERS IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT OR EARLY EDUCATION AND- ARE COMMITTED TO INCLUSION SPECIAL EDUCATION. EDUCATION FROM BIRTH THOSE OPPONENTS REALLY ARE CORE OF OUR CULTURE. THAT'S A GREAT SEGUE TO MY NEXT COURT ACTUALLY I WONDERING IF YOU SPEAK TO THEM. OF SOME OF THE E. D. S. C. C. FOLK THAT WERE- TASK THIS THAT BE TRAINS. OF WE HAVE THIS SURVEY FROM NOVEMBER DESCENT SORT OF MATCH WHAT YOU'RE HEARING WITH FOLKS I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'VE GOT OBVIOUSLY HUGE WORKLOAD- WE'RE DEALING WITH KOBE IT'S SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A TOUGH TIME. IS IMPORTANT IS MORALE IN YOUR VIEW HIGH AMONG THESE EMPLOYEES RIGHT NOW. I WOULD SAY OVERALL FOR STATE EMPLOYEES IT'S PROBABLY PRETTY LOW. THEY HAVE THE ALMOST 10% PAY CUT ON TOP OF ALL THAT JUST NOT PANDEMIC WORK. AND YOU'VE HEARD FAMILY LAW SAYS AND OTHER COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN THESE LOSING JOBS OR FROM THEM AND TO MAKE IT SO. SO I WOULD STAY. THEY'RE JUST DESERVE OVERALLS MORALE ISSUES. IN REGARDS TO THIS TRANSITION SPECIFICALLY WE'VE HAD SOME STATS SAY THAT THEY'RE LEANING AND ESPECIALLY FROM THE ANALYSTS LEVEL BECAUSE THEY DO SEE POTENTIAL PROMOTIONS. THE ONES WHO ARE MORE CHILD DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANTS- EDUCATION PROGRAM CONSULTANTS. WE'VE HEARD MORE CONCERNS FROM AROUND. SEVEN WE NOW THERE ARE SOME STAFF WHO THINK. RATE THIS IS A TIME IN WHICH MASS THAT A KID OF OUR FAMILY AND SO WILL REALLY BE A- ACROSS REGIONS. AND BUT WE DO KNOW AND HAVE ALERTED YES THAT'S THAT THERE ARE SOME STAFF OR LOOKING FOR OTHER JOBS SAID THERE. THERE WILL BE SOME STAFF WHO DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN THE CITY AND BECAUSE OF THAT WILL REALLY LOOKS TOWARDS CD AND FINDING A DIFFERENT POSITION. THANK I HAD A DIFFERENT COURT. INDETERMINATE ARE TO BE TOLD RESPECTFUL OF SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT- WE HAVE A COMPLETE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING TO COME AFTER THIS AND THE PUBLIC COMMENT ONE MORE PANEL SO. YOU GO AHEAD AND ASK IT I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION AND THEN THEN MAYBE THE ANSWER COULD BE BRIEF YEAH- SO. YOUR TESTIMONY THIS IS FOR C. D. E. YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT. YOU BECAUSE WE STILL WOULD MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER A LOT OF THE CHILD CARE. THROUGH YOUR CONTROLLER PRESCHOOLS AS WONDERING- IS JUST PRETTY COMMON OR ARE THERE CAN BE A LOT OF AREAS WHERE THERE'S OVERLAPPING AUTHORITY BETWEEN YOU AND- DSS. THE CURRENTLY SOME. BETWEEN STAGE ONE AND THE REST OF THAT CAL WORK STAGES. BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AND SINCE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OPERATE STAGE ONE THREE THE COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AND WE USE THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS TO OPERATE AT CENTER WITH SAYS TRANSACTION THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR CONTRACTORS THAT ARE. CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM CONTRACTORS ALSO HOLD EITHER EARLY LEARNING CARE CONTRACTS AND THE SAME WITH THE NUTRITION PROGRAMS SAID THEY MIGHT HOLD A CHILD AND ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE ONE OF OUR OTHER SCHOOL BASED MEAL PROGRAMS. THAT WE OPERATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU TRAILER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THEN LET ME JUST IN SUMMARY SAY TO THE PEOPLE THAT TESTIFIED YOU PICKED UP. THE CONCERN OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS TRANSITION IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN ON TIME IT THAT IF IT'S NOT THAT YOU FLY GUESTS. IN A TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE MANNER ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUES ARE THE REMAINING AND- AND I JUST PICKED THAT UP FROM EVERYBODY STATEMENTS AND QUESTIONS WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. WHICH IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE MASTER PLAN IT'S GOING TO BEGIN WITH CHRIS PERRY FROM HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES JOURNAL KUBRICK FROM- WEST DEAD AND THEN SIR CORTEZ FROM THE LA O'S OFFICE IN WILL GO IN THAT ORDER. WELCOME MISTER. THANK YOU CHAIR. HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE HAVE REDUCED THE LENGTH OF THE PRESENTATION. AND WOULD DIRECT YOU TO OUR HANDOUTS FOR THE DETAILS BUT I WOULD ALSO REALLY LIKE TO THANK YOU AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR. THE SUPPORT IN THE LEADERSHIP ON EARLY LEARNING AND CARE OVER MANY MANY YEARS AND THE SUPPORT- ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN. WE THINK THAT THE TITULAR LAY IN A- COMA NINETEEN HAND EMIC WORLD- AND THE FRAGILITY THAT'S BEEN EXPOSED IN THE EARLY LEARNING SYSTEM THAT THE MASTER PLAN. IS WELL TIMED AND I THINK WILL PROVIDE US WITH SOME OPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INCREASING ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE. FOR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND MORE SUPPORT FOR THE WORK FORCE WITHOUT ALTERNATE NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW COULD CONNECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHRIS FOR THAT INTRODUCTION I'M GONNA SHARE MY SCREEN. HERE- WE. THIRD DISTRICT- BUILT ON MY CHRISTMAS AND WANTED TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE MASTER PLAN I IN YOUR ITEMS ONLINE THAT AGE TWENTY TWO YEARS AB IT OUTLINED IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND REALLY IT'S A LONG TERM PLAN- LOOKING FORWARD AND SAYING IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WORKING TOWARDS TRANSFORMING EARLY CARE AND LEARNING SYSTEM. HI AND THIS INCLUDES BUILDING AROUND FOUR KEY COMPONENTS AROUND AS CHRIS MENTIONED ACCESS AND QUALITY AND SCHOOL READING AS SPEND AND ALSO LOOKING AT THAT WORKSHOPS AND HOW WE BUILD FOR THAT. FUTURE- WE HAVE PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER. IN A- CREDIT REPORT WHICH CAN BE DOWNLOADED AT THE PROJECT'S WEBSITE. BOB WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS WEBSITE IN THAT IT BRINGS TO LIFE THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND THROUGH THE RESEARCH ON THIS PROJECT- AND THAT IS IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE IT'S ABOUT CHILDREN IT'S ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES AND ABOUT THOSE THAT. CARE AND EDUCATE OUR YOUNG CHILDREN AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS WEBSITE IS- BROUGHT THE REPORT AS WELL AS A SUMMARY BUT YOU CAN ALSO FIND THOSE STORIES YOUR VIDEOS. AS WELL AS A WAY THAT JUST THE- REALLY KEY POINTS AROUND HOW ARE WE SUPPORTING IN A COUPLE SYSTEM HOW ARE WE TRANSFORMING WHAT WE DO. AND PROVIDE AND SUPPORT AND MANY OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE COME OUT THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING WHICH REGARD TO. ON HOW WE MAKING SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS ARE SERVED. HOW DO WE FUND THE SYSTEM HOW DO WE SUPPORT THE WORKFORCE I'M ALREADY DRESSED IN IN THE PLANS AND IDEAS SHARED IN THE REPORT AND- I CONNECTED TO WHAT'S- AVAILABLE TO THE WEBSITE. TO VERY BRIEFLY AGAIN I KNOW THIS IS IN THERE I. DON'T KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE TWENTY FOUR- THERE THERE ARE THESE REC. ARE KEY GOAL AREAS ARE. AND GONNA HIGHLIGHTED FEW FOR YOU- IN AND WHAT I SHOULD SO. FOUR KEY AREAS- PROGRAM WORKFORCE. GOVERNANCE IMAGE. AND BASICALLY THE UNDERLINING FOCUS OF THE MASTER PLAN IS HOW DO WE PROVIDE FOR THE TREMENDOUS NEED THAT EXISTS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. BETTER STATE BASED ON RESEARCH OF WHAT WE KNOW MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR THEIR OUTCOMES. ON FOR THEIR LIVES AND SO INTERCONNECTED IN ALL OF THIS IS HAVING PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE FOR SUPPORT NEEDS. ARE WE SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT AREAS SUCH AS PAID FAMILY LEAVE- INTEGRATION WITH. LOOKING AT YOURS ARE ZERO THREE THREE SYSTEM AND THE PRESCHOOL. AND WHAT IT MEANS TO EXPAND ACCESS WHAT IT MEANS TO ENRICH OPPORTUNITIES. AND PUTTING THAT TOGETHER IN A FRAMEWORK THAT. SUPPORTS CONTINUITY OF CARE SUPPORTS EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN IN ADDRESSING THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF OUR STATE. ON ALL OF THIS THOUGH IS NOT POSSIBLE UNLESS WE HAVE PEOPLE READY TO PROVIDE FOR THAT CARE AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. AND TO WORKING TOWARDS BUILDING OUR WORKFORCE BASED ON WITH THE SKILLS THE COMPETENCIES. IN THE PATHWAYS FOR CAREER THAT WILL LEAD TO US BEING ABLE TO EXPAND AND ADDRESS- THE KIND OF PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS WE SEE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. AND THEN. IMPORTANTLY AND WE'VE HEARD THIS COME OUT THROUGHOUT THE SITE HEARING IS HOW DO WE PUT TOGETHER A FUNDING SYSTEM. SO THAT. ARE IT'S BOTH ADDRESSING THE NEEDS BUT ALSO. CREATING ALIGNMENT WHAT WE SAY IT MATTERS IN THE SYSTEM SO- YOU KNOW SUPPORTING IT WAS CALLED OUT THE DIFFERENCES WE ARE RIGHT SO WE PUT TOGETHER. A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING HOW TO LOOK AT RATES AND RESTRUCTURING THEM- SO THAT WERE UNIFIED IN OUR SYSTEM TO FIND THAT WE DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. THAT LEADER OSEI UNEVENNESS IN THE WAY THAT OUR PROGRAMS ARE EXPERIENCED- OR ARE. UTILIZED IN THE SEARCH SOME SORT OF LOOK FOR A TO AS WE CAN. THE FUNDS- ALTER IN ENTRY. THE WAY THEY WE PROVIDE PROGRAM. TO CREATE A- TO SUPPORT PATH. AND ALTERNATELY PRO ARE- WHAT WE SEE. MATTERS FROM RESEARCH WITH REGARD TO QUALITY AND- BUILDING FOR FOUR EIGHT A FUTURE THAT IS MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE IN OUR PROGRAMS AND THEN FINALLY. LOOKING AT GOVERNANCE ADMINISTRATION SAID THIS GETS TO YOU. HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT WE MANAGE THESE PROGRAMS THEY'RE DONE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY- THAT STREAMLINES THAT THEY DIED TAKES ADVANTAGE OF. VARIOUS TOOLS IT WAS CALLED EARLIER IN THE HEARING WHERE WE HAD DATA WHERE WE PUT TOGETHER NETWORKS WHERE WE- LOOK FOR THOSE TYPES OF. OPPORTUNITIES TO- SUPPORT EQUITY THROUGH- OUR AGENCY AND EXPERIENCE THAT- REALLY IS PARENT FRIENDLY FAMILY FRIENDLY- IN TERMS OF THEIR INTERACTION OF NAVIGATING. FOR THEIR NEEDS SO THE REPORT GOES INTO GREAT DETAILS REGARDING SPECIFIC STRATEGIES INCLUDING- YOU KNOW EXPANSION OF PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE FUNDING FORMULAS INCLUDING LOOKING AT STRUCTURES FOR THE WORK FORCE- AND BREAKS THIS DOWN. INTO ACTION STEPS THAT INVOLVED- ALL OF OUR STATE AGENCIES WORKING TOGETHER CONTRIBUTING BUT ALSO- LOOKING TO OUR YOU KNOW OUR OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITIES ARE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITIES AND- ALTERNATELY ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR FAMILIES SO- PART. OF THE CHARGE OF THIS. REPORTER RESEARCH WAS TO LOOK AND SAY WOW WHAT IT. AND WHAT WE THAT INCLUDE- IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING R. CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM AND SO WE HAVE OUTLINED IN OUR WORK- AND CREATED A COST DRIVEN MODEL. THAT DEPENDED UPON THE KINDS OF POLICIES AND- AND CHOICES THAT ARE MADE- WOULD LEAD TO ANYWHERE BETWEEN OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS ANOTHER ADDITIONAL TWO TO TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT AND SO- PRESENTLY. WE HAVE ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN CURRENT- PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM BY IN ADDITION THERE'S ANOTHER APPROXIMATELY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IT'S CONTRIBUTED THROUGH FAMILY FEES FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF SUPPORT. AND SO ESSENTIALLY WE'RE SAYING- UPWARDS OF DOUBLING IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WOULD BE ON ON ORDER OF CREATING THE KIND OF ACCESS ADDRESSING THE QUALITY- AND BUILDING A SYSTEM. THAT WE THINK REALLY WILL FOLLOW WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE SEE IN THE RESEARCH- WITH REGARD TO THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN. IN SUPPORT OF THOSE THAT THAT ARE CARING AND EDUCATING THEM- SO I WANT TO LEAVE TIME FOR YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND HAPPY TO GO INTO ANY FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE PLAN I'M LIKE I SAID YOU HAVE A BIT MORE IN THE ITEM. PRICE TWO D. BETWEEN THAT AND WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE- YOU TO CHECK OUT THE. REPORT- THROUGH THE WEBSITE. AND THEN THE L. A. MY SERRA PRETEND LIKE TO AND OFFICE WELL MY FELLOW PANELISTS WERE KEY INDIVIDUALS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRAFTING OF THE MASTER PLAN I JOIN THE PANEL TODAY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS READ THE MASTER PLAN CONTAINED IN DOCUMENTS AND ATTENDED ASSOCIATED BRIEFINGS SO WHILE THE LEGISLATURE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OF THE RESEARCH EFFORTS OR DRAFTING OF THE MASTER PLAN. THE LEGISLATURE WAS ABLE TO SCOPE THE RESEARCH QUESTION THROUGH THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL PROCESS TO THIS END THE LEGISLATURE COULD EVALUATE WHETHER THE MASTER PLAN ANSWERED ALL THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED QUESTIONS AND OTHER QUESTIONS OF INTEREST WE WHICH IS KNOWN FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT WHILE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLAN READ SHE WAS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET AGREEMENT THE IMPLEMENTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MASTER PLAN HAS NOT YET BEEN AGREED TO BY THE LEGISLATURE. AS THE ADMINISTRATION PRESENTS FOR POSTAL THAT STEM FROM THE MASTER PLAN WORKS SUCH AS THE TEACHING EXPANSION PROPOSAL THE EDUCATION BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARD LAST WEEK THAT THE LEGISLATURE ME WANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE ACTIONS MAINTAIN ALIGNMENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES WE WOULD NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THE MASTER PLANS ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL THERE ARE A LOT OF OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS THE STATE WOULD NEED TO ADDRESS TO IMPLEMENT THE MASTER PLAN. AND MOST NOTABLY THE FISCAL PICTURE ON THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS. OF THE COMMITTEE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. CENTER PAN. SO PRETTY WE HAVE THE MASTERPIECE- OLD IS THE INDUSTRY RECOGNIZE RIVER SHORT AMOUNT TIME HERE TODAY HEY YES- DAHLE NEED DETAILS OF THE PLANET RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO ESSENTIALLY. PRESENT THE PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE AND- PRIORITIZE HOW WERE DOUBTS GOING INTO GREAT WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND TERMS OF EXECUTING THIS PLAN- ONCE WE GET- AGREEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. HE JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THAT EXPLAIN WHAT THAT THE PROPOSAL THE PLAN FOR THE- DEMONSTRATIONS PLANNED TO DO SO. MS BERRY I THINK THAT'S TO YOU. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AS MENTIONED BY THE L. A. O. THE THERE ARE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ALREADY BEING CONSIDERED AS PART OF THIS BUDGET CYCLE SUCH AS E. T. K. EXPANSION AND I BELIEVE EARLIER IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW. BEST TO USETHE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR RECOVERY- THOSE ARE SOMEWHAT ALIGNED WITH SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE MASTER PLAN SLOW WE ARE ALREADY SEEING SOME ALIGNMENT WITH THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WILL. PARTNER WITH- OUR COLLEAGUES AT SOCIAL SERVICES AND CD IN THE LEGISLATURE ON CREATIVE WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING PARTS OF THE MASTER PLAN IN THE NEAR TERM BUT THIS IS A TEN YEAR PLAN. IT WILL TAKE MANY YEARS- AND WE CAN START SOME OF THE WORK WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WERE RECEIVING NOW. OKAY I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY AS I'VE BEEN HERE OTHER THAN TO HEARING THAT THERE'S BITS OF THE PLAN BEING TUCKED INTO THE BUDGET SOME OF IT BASED ON FEDERAL FUNDS WHICH OF COURSE ARE NOT. ONGOING BECAUSE IF THIS WERE TALKING CODE FUNDS THOSE ARE TEMPORARY- I GUESS I WOULD URGE THAT THERE BE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE APPROPRIATE- BOTH POLICY AND- SUBCOMMITTEE. BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES IN TERMS OF- PRESENTING THE PLAN MORE AS A WHOLE AND THEN COMING UP WITH A STRATEGY I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS GONNA BE BUILT INTO THE MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATION FINANCING NO WE PASS. A YEAR'S BUDGET TIME BUT OFTENTIMES MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS SO. THAT THAT'S PART. WILL BE SEEING THAT IN THE MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS THE BUDGET STRUCTURE AND- GOVERNORS- PROPOSAL WE COME TO MAY. BUT I THINK- SOME GREATER CLARITY AS FAR AS HOW THIS PLAN IS GOING TO BE PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE APPRECIATED. BOB LET ME JUST REITERATE CENTER PANTS CONCERN BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE- RUNNING LATE TODAY NEW SHOULDN'T CONCERN A CONFUSED THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT ASKING LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND MAKING LOTS O STATEMENTS.
