ABOUT DRILLING OFF OF OUR COATS

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:28.767 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THE

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:30.502 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:33.772 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LEASING USUALLY WHEN

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:35.641 region:rollup2
THEY ASK FOR.

00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:37.442 region:rollup2
LEASING PROPOSALS IN VARIOUS

00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:39.945 region:rollup2
SECTORS ALONG THE COAST IT'S

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:41.613 region:rollup2
BEEN TARGETED ITS BAN THOUGHTFUL

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:43.081 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN DIRECTED IT'S BEEN

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:44.616 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE HAVE FIVE AND WILL

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:46.451 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO FIGHT IF IT IF

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.552 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TALKING BACK CALIFORNIA.

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:49.054 region:rollup2
BUT THE FACT THAT THE MISTRESS

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:50.255 region:rollup2
CAME UP AND JUST LIKE IT SAID

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:51.823 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP ALL LEASING.

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:53.158 region:rollup2
REALLY MAKES WILL.

00:29:51.823 --> 00:29:54.726 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION THEY KNOW WHAT

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:56.428 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING OR WHAT THEY WANT

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:58.830 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMPLISH.

00:29:56.428 --> 00:30:01.500 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS OVER.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:03.135 region:rollup2
THREE DECADES ESTABLISHED THAT

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.937 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOT BE EXPANDING

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:07.706 region:rollup2
DRILLING IN.

00:30:05.937 --> 00:30:09.141 region:rollup2
OFF THE SHORES OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:10.275 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S ACTUALLY

00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:12.010 region:rollup2
HAPPENING THEY'RE CLOSING DOWN

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:13.812 region:rollup2
OIL PLATFORMS THERE AND LIFE IN

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.080 region:rollup2
CERTAIN OIL FIELDS.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.947 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY WINDING DOWN THAT

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.916 region:rollup2
DRILLING BECAUSE THE FEDERAL

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:19.551 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN A PARTNER.

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:21.086 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA'S LONG

00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:21.720 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED STANCE OF NO

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:22.854 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN OIL DRILLING OFF OF

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.790 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:27.125 region:rollup2
THEN THE SHOWS.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:29.261 region:rollup2
AND I LAUD ALL OF THE PROTESTS

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:30.662 region:rollup2
MARCHES.

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.464 region:rollup2
CIVIC ACTION THAT HAPPENED OVER

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:34.266 region:rollup2
THE WEEKEND TO SEND A MESSAGE TO

00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:36.234 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THIS

00:30:34.266 --> 00:30:36.835 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN PERSPECTIVE IS NOT

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.403 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:40.238 region:rollup2
WELCOME HERE.

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:41.740 region:rollup2
THE RISKS ARE SIGNIFICANT WERE

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:43.608 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD WITH TRY TO

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:46.511 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW WE ADAPT OUR

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:48.246 region:rollup2
OCEANS TO THE CHANGING CHEMISTRY

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:50.349 region:rollup2
TO THE CHANGES THAT WERE SAYING.

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:52.384 region:rollup2
AND ADDING TO THAT THEY EIGHT

00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:55.020 region:rollup2
AND EXACERBATED THREAD OF OIL

00:30:52.384 --> 00:30:56.555 region:rollup2
SPILL AND OTHER CONTAMINATION

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.023 region:rollup2
REALLY PUTS AT RISK THE.

00:30:56.555 --> 00:30:59.524 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR

00:30:58.023 --> 00:31:01.093 region:rollup2
COASTAL ECONOMY THAT HAS BEEN

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:04.696 region:rollup2
BUILT UP OVER THIS TIME.

00:31:01.093 --> 00:31:07.599 region:rollup2
SO IT JUST SEEMS.

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:10.168 region:rollup2
HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:12.137 region:rollup2
BEING ATTEMPTED OR WHAT IS.

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:13.739 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY THINK THAT THE END

00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:15.674 region:rollup2
GOAL THOUGH THE PROCESS IS GOING

00:31:13.739 --> 00:31:16.775 region:rollup2
TO BE? SO I THINK IT'S VERY PORT

00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:19.144 region:rollup2
FOR ALL OF US AND FOR ALL

00:31:16.775 --> 00:31:20.979 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS STEP UP NOW AND SAY

00:31:19.144 --> 00:31:22.514 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:25.183 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE AND.

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:27.185 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY'LL LOOK ELSEWHERE OR.

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:28.754 region:rollup2
BILL BUT MORE THOUGHTFUL IN HOW

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:30.188 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS EVEN

00:31:28.754 --> 00:31:32.457 region:rollup2
IN THEIR TERMS.

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:34.092 region:rollup2
THE NATION'S ENERGY NEEDS BUT

00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:35.527 region:rollup2
THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR US NOW

00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:37.262 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN INAPPROPRIATE FOR THREE

00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:38.964 region:rollup2
DECADES AND IT'S GONNA BE A

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:39.865 region:rollup2
FIGHT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE SO I

00:31:38.964 --> 00:31:41.333 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

00:31:39.865 --> 00:31:44.035 region:rollup2
FORWARD. AND YOU DO REPRESENT AN

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:44.569 region:rollup2
AREA THAT IS MOST THAT THREAT.

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:46.037 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU THINK EXISTING

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:47.839 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:49.808 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE THAT

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:51.843 region:rollup2
IF LEASES WERE GRANTED OFF OF

00:31:49.808 --> 00:31:53.178 region:rollup2
OTHER WATERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:54.346 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD WOULD EVER BE ABLE

00:31:53.178 --> 00:31:55.714 region:rollup2
PUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:57.015 region:rollup2
ABLE TO MATCH THAT OIL BUT IN

00:31:55.714 --> 00:31:58.650 region:rollup2

INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS OF THE

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:03.455 region:rollup2
THREAT IS. FAR MORE TANGIBLE AND

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.489 region:rollup2

THAT AS SOMEONE WHO WAS BORN AND

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:15.560 region:rollup2
RAISED IN THE DISTRICT THAT I

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:17.495 region:rollup2
REPRESENT AND THIS VOICE IS NOT

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.898 region:rollup2
A LONE VOICE.

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:22.033 region:rollup2
SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF PEOPLE

EXPANDING OFFSHORE OIL IS NOT

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:30.942 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD FOR

00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:32.744 region:rollup2

THIS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL I THINK

00:38:32.744 --> 00:38:36.314 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE INVITING

00:38:34.746 --> 00:38:38.249 region:rollup2

THIS IS NOT THE DIRECTION Y.

00:38:45.023 --> 00:38:47.425 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD I THINK IT IS THE

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:49.561 region:rollup2
RIGHT THING TO DO AS THE
