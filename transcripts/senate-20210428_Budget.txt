FOR THE OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. AND I AND I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW THOSE OF YOU PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. THAT MUTING YOUR PHONES OR COMPUTERS GREATLY HELPS US ELIMINATE ACOUSTIC FEEDBACK. AND WHEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE RECOGNIZED.

SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK- A PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU CAN BE SEEN ON THE SCREEN STATE YOUR NAME AND THEN YOU ARE READY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE.

I WILL MAINTAIN DECORUM DURING HEARING AS IS CUSTOMARY ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS DISRUPTIVE MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE REMOTE MEETING SERVICE OR HAVE THEIR CONNECTIONS MUTED. WHILE EVERY EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO STREAMLINE OUR HEARING PROCESSING CONDUCTOR HEARINGS IT IS CLOSE TO THE SAME MANNER AS IS CUSTOMARY. THESE NEW TECHNOLOGY SOMETIMES CREATE LAG TIMES AND- OTHER ISSUE SO. PRESHEAF YOU'RE BEING RESPECTFUL AND PATIENT. NOW BEFORE WE BEGIN LET'S SEE I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM YET NO WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM YET SO WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN THE HEARING AS A SUB COMMITTEE- AND THE REASON WILL DO THAT IS BECAUSE I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO OTHER COMMITTEES OR AT LEAST ONE OTHER COMMITTEE MEETING AT THE PRESENT TIME. AND SO SOME OF OUR MEMBERS MAYBE IN THAT COMMITTEE AND I'M SURE THEY WILL COME DOWN AS SOON AS THEY'RE ABLE- SO. WE WILL- AS I SAID BEGIN THE HEARING AS SUBCOMMITTEE AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE BILL TODAY IT IS AB EIGHTY SEVEN AND IT IS A CLEAN UP BILL TO AN ACTION WE TOOK LAST YEAR AND IT IS A REGARDING THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT. SO HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE A RELATIVELY- STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE HEARING. AB EIGHTY SEVEN MAKES TECHNICAL CHANGES NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE REALIGNMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AS APPROVED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACTIONS- WHAT THE CLEAN UP ALLOWS IS FOR COUNTIES TO ESTABLISH SECURE. YOUTH TREATMENT FACILITIES FOR YOUTH WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED TO THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND THE REASON WE ARE NEEDING TO DO THIS ACTION IS WE WANT TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS AND AVOID YOUTH POTENTIALLY BEING COMMITTED TO THE ADULT SYSTEM- WHICH COULD TAKE PLACE IF WE DON'T ACT NOW- IF WE DELAY ACTION. WE WILL HEAR THE BILL AND ALLOW MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTINS PRIOR TO TAKING THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN WE WILL VOTE AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT. AND BEFORE I TURN TO THE PRESENTATION FOR AB EIGHTY SEVEN MISTER VICE CHAIR DO YOU HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS NO JUST PROJECT DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR- NIELSEN VICE CHAIR. SO LET US BEGIN WITH THE PRESENTATION OF AB EIGHTY SEVEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- BERMAN FINANCE YOU'RE READY. THE MORNING GO AHEAD. MORNING MADAMS VICE CHAIR NEIL AND MY OF THE- EREKLE WITH A OF FINE AND I WILL PRESENTING ON AB SEVEN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE BILL. BACKGROUND SB EIGHT THREE WHICH WAS BUDGET- BILL FROM TWENTY TWO BUDGET AT. REALIGNED THE CARE SUPERB OF THE THAT HAVE. SPECIFIED FROM ARE DIVISION OF G. JUSTICE OR DG. COUNTIES STARTING TO ONE THIS YEAR. ISRAEL WILL ENABLE YOU TO REMAIN IN THE COMMUNITY AND STATE TO THE FAMILY WITH THE GO OF AND- OUR- FOR JUSTICE AND YOUTH. AND REDUCING UNIVERSITY. AB SEVEN UP FOR. TODAY AN OF FOLLOW ON TO S. B. TWENTY. AND ADDRESS AREAS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO HELP. RELY OF TO COUNTIES THIS. DJJ WE CLOSE INTAKE A UNDERLINE OF THIS WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION. AB EIGHTY SEVENTH. THE D. WILL CLOSE. AND THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT ARE OF DJJ TO NEARBY A TO BUY JAN OF NEXT YEAR FOR THE TRANSFER OF ANY REMAINING USE THAT WERE UNABLE TO DISCHARGE PRIOR TO THE CLOSURE OF DJJ. THIS BILL IF THAT WISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR SIX TREATMENT THIS A- FOR NEED YOUTH THAT'S CONSERVE WITH THE INTENT LANGUAGE SB TWENTY. IF THAT'S AT LEAST A FULL. WILL HAVE A STILL TO BE ABLE PER. TREATMENT AND EDUCATE SPECIFIC TO THEIR NEEDS. THE CIVIC LAID THE BILL INCLUDES THE FINDINGS THAT COURTS MUST MAKE IN ORDER TO ASSIGN YOU TO THESE FACILITIES. AND IF THE COURT ORDERS YOU TO BE PLACED IN SECURE FACILITY THE COURT MUST RECEIVE REVIEW. AND APPROVE AN INDIVIDUAL REHABILITATION PLAN FOR THAT USE THAT IDENTIFIES THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND THE PROGRAMMING TREATMENT AND EDUCATION. THAT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE. TO THEM DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR PLACEMENT. THE BILL ALSO FROM THE CORE TO BE A BILL. TO TRY YOU. THE SECURE. TO LESS RESTRICTIVE FACILITY- TO LESS RESTRICT PROGRAM. IF AN ALTAR. PLACEMENT WITH- BETTER SIR THAT YOU AND THAT YOU NEED. FINALLY THE BILL PROPOSES OTHER TECHNICAL AND G. THAT FROM CO SECTION RELATED THE PRIOR DJJ. COMMITMENT PROCESS. I'M NOT CONCLUDE PRESENTATION I JOINED WITH MY CO. ALLISON AND WE ARE HAPPY TO AND ANY. FROM THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- ARMS WILL NOW OPEN. DISCUSSION WITH. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I DO NOT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. THEY DO NOT WARRANT QUESTIONS. THE BILL LAST YEAR IT WAS A FAILURE. DISK CLEANUP. IS TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING BETTER THAT FAILED LAST YEAR. IT ONLY FAILS IT WORKS. THE ESSENCE OF THIS RE ALIGNMENT OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IS WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE PREVIOUS ONES HAVE BEEN APPLYING. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT. I CALL IT THE PUNCHES PILOT APPROACH THE STATE IS ONE HANDS. OF WHAT HERETOFORE BEEN RESPONSE AND DUMPING IT. ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT FAILS IN THIS. THE WORD RECIDIVISM IS A JOKE. THE ONLY REASON THAT THIS BILL WILL BE FACT IN THE LAST BILL LAST YEAR AFFECTED A DECLINE RECIDIVISM IS THERE WILL BE NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ANYBODY WHO CONTINUES A CRIMINOLOGY. SO FOR THE NORD IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. AND THEREFORE THEY DID NOT RECEIVE A- IT REMOVES ALL ARE GREATLY DIMINISHES THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM REHABILITATION. WHY BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE FACILITIES THE CAPABILITY THE STAFF THE EXPERTISE. TO DO THE JOB. THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IN FACT THE JUVENILE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EVEN WAS INADEQUATE FOR DECADES IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT IS BEEN ARGUABLE. IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL J. YOU REALLY DID SOMETHING GREAT. FIVE BUT GO BACK AND TALK TO YOUR COUNTY SUPERVISORS. YOUR SHARE. THE POLICE CHIEFS THE VICTIM'S BY THE WAY VICTIMS NEVER GET ANY INPUT INTO THESE KIND OF BILLS NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT A PART OF THE DEAL THE VICTIMS. THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT ONLY ONE THING CAN FIX. REPEAL LAST YEAR'S BILL. I URGE IN THE INTEREST OF THE CITIZENS THAT WE REPRESENT AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE JUVENILE OFFENDERS WHO WILL NOT BE HELPED BY THIS ILL FOUNDED REGISTRATION. TO VOTE NO. I'M BEFORE I CALL IN ANY OTHER MEMBERS- WE HAVE A QUORUM SO AND- COMMITTEE CONSULTANT YOU PLEASE ESTABLISH OUR QUORUM FOR US CALL THE ROLL. SENATORS SKINNER I'M HERE. SKINNER HERE NIELSEN. YES IN HERE CABALLERO. CORTESE CORTESE HERE. DOLLY THE RUSSELL RATHER HERE EGGMAN. EGGMAN HERE GROW GROWTH HERE KAMLAGER. KAMLAGER HERE LIAM. WHERE MCGUIRE WELL MCGUIRE HERE. MELENDEZ MELINDA'S HERE MAN MAN HERE NEWMAN. THE TROUBLE. PAN CAN HERE STERN. STERN HERE STERN HERE. STERN HERE BY CASTING. WE HAVE A QUORUM ESTABLISHED SO WE CAN CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION SENATOR DRAW SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THE VAST MAJORITY OF INCARCERATED YOUTH ARE HELD IN COUNTY LEVEL FACILITIES LAST YEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOM WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO FULLY RELYING JUVENILE JUSTICE FOR THAT YOUNG PEOPLE REMAIN IN OUR COMMUNITIES INSTEAD OF BEING HELD IN YOUTH PRISONS FAR AWAY. FROM THE RESOURCES AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO HEAL TRAUMA AND CHANGE THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES THIS WAS A MOMENT OF HOPE. THERE WAS ALSO RECOGNITION THAT WE HAD TO GET IT RIGHT IT WOULD NOT BE EASY WE NEEDED TO FIND ALTERNATIVES FOR ALL YOUTH OFFENDERS. FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD RESULT IN MORE YOUNG PEOPLE BEING TRIED AS ADULTS. AS A RESULT OF OUR CAREFUL EFFORTS SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE WAS SIGNED INTO LAW AND IMPLEMENTED. A THOUGHTFUL PLAN FOR CLOSING THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE BY TRANSFERRING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CUSTODY TREATMENT AND SUPERVISION OF YOU TO THE COUNTIES. SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE ALLOCATED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO COUNTIES TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND IMPROVE THE FACILITIES TO INCREASE LOCAL CAPACITY TO SERVE OUR YOUTH. D. D. J. J. INTAKE ENDS BEGINNING JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE PROVIDED NO FINAL CLOSURE DATE. THIS BILL AB AB SEVEN CLOSES DJJ ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND REQUIRES THE DIRECTOR OF DJJ. TO DEVELOP A PLAN BY JANUARY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR THE TRANSFER OF ANY REMAINING USE IN DJJ WERE UNABLE. TO BE DISCHARGED OR MOVED. LAST YEAR SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE CODIFIED LEGISLATURE INTENT TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL DISPOSITIONAL TRACK TO BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE. TO ADULT COURT PROSECUTION FOR HIGHER NEED YOUTH. AB EIGHTY SEVEN ESTABLISHES SECURE YOU TREATMENT FACILITIES FOR HIGH NEED YOUTH OR FOURTEEN OR OLDER AND HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO THE SPECIAL DISPOSITIONAL TRACK. IT PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW COUNTIES WILL DO TO KATE HOUSE AND FACILITATE SERVICES FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IT ALSO REQUIRES A REHABILITATION PLAN. TO HELP THEM ON THEIR PATH TO LEADING MEANINGFUL LIVES AS CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE I'M FOCUSED ON OUR VISION FOR A BETTER JUSTICE SYSTEM. I WILL MAKE CERTAIN THE NEW OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IS ADEQUATELY STAFFED AND RESOURCE STE SO THAT THROUGH RE ALIGNMENT FROM THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS REALIZED. I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS TRANSITION FROM A SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN DAMAGING TO OUR YOUTH AND COMMUNITIES TOWARD THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES HEALING RESTORATION AND TO OPPORTUNITY FOR CHANGE. AND GROWTH THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU- NEO COMMENTS BY. MEMBERS IN ELSE SEVEN AT- I WANTED. TALK AS GROVE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM I A FEW IF. YEAH. THE BETTER. YES SO GIVEN THE SURE- TIME. THAT COUNTY WOULD HAVE BUILDER FOR SIX USE OF. WHICH I UNDERSTOOD IS ABOUT YEARS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A COUNTY ELECTED TO BUILD ONE BUT WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION BY DJ DAY'S FINAL CLOSURE DATE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES I HAD TO TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO ALISON HEWITT THANK YOU. I THINK YOU DEPART OF FINANCE. THANK YOU FOR THE CALL. I'M THERE'S A LOT OF EXISTING THAT THERE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TO LACI DICE THE RESPONSE QUESTION I THINK IS THAT THE COUNTY IS IN CERTAIN CASE NAY A LOT TO USE X. IN. FOR OF TIME AND IF THEY ARE CON. KIND OF NEW FIRST- THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WHERE THEY BE ABLE TO RELY ON EXISTING. AND FACILITIES IN PRO THAT THEY COUNTIES ARE OCT NINETY AS I COUNTIES ARE SERVED THE MATURE OF YOU AND REALLY WHAT WE'RE AT IS THAT A POPULATION OF THE YOUTH AND ARE ON SENT TO JAIL THAT WE NOW A REALLY ACCOUNT SINCE. THERE WOULD BE KIND OF AN UNDER OR ABILITY REALIZE ON EXISTING IN FIRST FOR THE TIME I. AND A WE HAVE THT THAT DIGITAL LEGISLATION EACH THREE SOME FUNDING TO SUPPORT WITHIN. UNDERSTANDING THAT MIGHT TAKE SOME BUT THERE'S NO WITH THE IT JUST LETTER NOT TO FRONT OF YOU RICK THE CAN TO SE TO NEW FOR TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL AND THEN THERE'S ALSO. FOR TO CONTRACT WITH OTHER I TOOK SECURE YOU TREATMENT AS A SERVICES THERE'S A NUMBER THERE'S FLEXIBILITY FOR THE IN THE IS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBLE TO THE CAN TO MEET THESE FOR. OF BOTH IN THE NEAR TERM AND THE LONG TERM. THANK YOU FOR THAT IS THERE ANOTHER PER. THAT THE COURT WOULD BEGIN TO SAY ASIDE CA OR UNTIL THE FIFTH WAS CAN. OR INTO THE COW COULDN'T. A CO. WITH THE OTHER. WITH ANOTHER IN A THIS CALL TO TAKE THESE. I'M AT RISK YOU. WE WOULDN'T BE IN A POSITION TO KINDA SPEAK TO NOT- I THINK THAT WOULD BE BAD. OF A FOR JUDICIAL. OR HAPPY TO THE CAR BACK AND SEE WE CAN PER SOME FOR UP IF. HOW CAN I DON'T KNOW WHO GONNA AND THIS SUMMER HAVE A COUPLE MORE OKAY. TO THE LAW. OF THE COUNTY WOULD NEED A SIX TREAT THIS. OR CON. FOR SO. BY FIRST TWENTY THREE. LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE IN PLACE BY THE COUNTY BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS THAT CORRECT. I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FULL I'M NOT A 100% SURE I KNOW THAT ESSENTIALLY. YOU WITH WILL BE REALIGNED TO THE COUNTY STRTING JULY FIRST. AND SO THE BILL IS PROVISIONED AROUND PROVIDING SECURE YOUTH. FACILITIES OR NOT FRAMEWORK. FOR THE JULY ONE REALIGNMENT BECAUSE COUNTIES NEED TO KIND OF RELY ON THAT FRAMEWORK. AND ABOUT THE TIME. AND THERE IS. UNDER THAT WE BE PENNY FROM THE BOY OF STATE COMMUNITY. RELATE TO THE SECURE TREATMENT FACILITIES. BUT THERE'S AN ABILITY TO RELY ON EXISTING REGULATIONS- IN THE NEAR TERM- UNDERSTANDING OF THE BOARD OF CKD CORRECTIONS NAME MODIFYING THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND THERE ARE CERTAIN TIME LINES AROUND. AND THAT FACILITY FREE THAT WOULD BE PENN FROM. THE BOY. IS THAT TIMELY TO STEP THE C. FOR ARE BECAUSE- OUT OF COURT TO THE BILL IS IT CHILL FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT NOW I DON'T RECALL THERE BEING A SPECIFIC DATE BY WHICH COUNTIES NEED TO HAVE SECURE EUSTACE TREATMENT FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING. ZACKS SOME OF THAT WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON HOW THE CORDS DETERMINE WITHIN THE IS KIND OF INDIVIDUAL REHABILITATION PLANS IN IN THAT USUAL PROCESS PROCESS WHERE USERS. I SEE THE END GOAL IS TO HIDE IF COUNTY IS. NEED TO HAVE THIS TO HAVE THEM IN. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT YOU'RE REFERRING BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC TIMELINE WHICH COUNTIES NEED TO HAVE THESE TREATMENT FACILITIES IN PLACE. AND BY ACCIDENT IDEAS THAT USE WOULD BE COMING TO THEM ON JULY FIRST THAT MAY REQUIRE THAT OF TREATMENT. BERMAN IF I DO YOU HAVE AN DATE. ACCORDING TO THE BILL IT'S JAN A JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE UNLESS I'M WRONG. IS THERE THAT A DAY. THAT AND COUNTIES GONNA BE TO HAVE. TO BUILD YOU THIS OR- AMOUNT BY THE SPECIFIC DATE. I APOLOGIZE HOW BEAUTIFUL UP WITH YOU SENATOR GIRLS I'M NOT OF A BUT DEEPER. TO BOARD AND THEY SAID THEY THERE IS A REQUIREMENT JULY TWENTY TWO THREE THE BOARD OF STATE. KERR WOULD- REVIEW X. STANDARDS AND CONSIDER MODIFYING THEM AND THERE'S A THERE'S A NUMBER OF TIME LINES AROUND KIND OF ESTABLISHED AN OFFENSE BEATS ME. I NOT AWARE OF A PROVISION IN THE BILL AT THIS POINT AS I SAY HERE THAT. COUNTY TO A STEP. SECURE YOU TREATMENT FACILITIES ON ANY SPECIFIC TIME WHEN OTHER. THE ON. FOR THE PURPOSES OF SERVING ID WHICH ON JULY FIRST OF YEAR. OKAY SO I GUESS THAT'S MY BECAUSE THE WAY THAT READ THE BILL OR THE BILL IS PRESENTED TO US BEFORE US TODAY IT SAYS THAT ACCORDING TO THE LANGUAGE IT CONTINUES AND THAT THE- WE HAVE TWO OR THE COUNTIES. HAVE TO EITHER PROVIDE SECURE FACILITIES BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE OR CONTRACT OUT FOR THE SERVICES FOR THESE. PARTICULAR USE- BUT IT ALSO SAYS. WE NEED A CORRECTIONS HAS UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH IS THE SAME DATE TO ESTABLISH THE STANDARDS. SO I'M I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT THE COUNTY HAS A CONTRACT DAY TO CONTRACT THEM OUT OR BUILD A FACILITY THAT HOUSES THESE INDIVIDUALS- THAT WERE SO BAD THEY ACTUALLY GOT CARVED OUT OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND- ON THE SAME DATE SO YOU'RE EXPECTING THE COUNTIES BASED ON THE BILL LANGUAGE BEFORE US THAT. THESE COUNTIES HAVE TO HAVE THE SECURE FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE OR CONTRACT OUT. AND THEN ALSO THE STANDARDS TO OPERATE THOSE FACILITIES OR BUILD THAT FACILITY OR TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE USE- DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE ESTABLISHED UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH IS. THE EXACT SAME DATE SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS WORKS ON THE GROUND PER SE. I UNDERSTAND I THINK I AM IF I CAN JUST QUICKLY CLARIFY I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT COUNTIES ARE GOING TO GO ABOUT ESTABLISHING. SECURITY IS TREATMENT FACILITIES I THINK SENATOR GROVE IN YOUR EXAMPLE YOU'RE ASSUMING A COUNTY WOULD CONSTRUCT A BRAND NEW FACILITY FROM THE GROUND UP TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT. THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT'S REQUIRED IN THE LEGISLATION THE LEGISLATION SIMPLY ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK- FOR HOW CAN YOU CAN OPERATE THE. SECURE YOU FACILITIES. COMPANIES HAVE THIS YEAR FOR STRUCTURE THAT THERE SERVING YOU THAT ARE. TO THE- AND- THE- HOUSE NOT KIND OF RUN THE GAMUT OF OR HOW DO. THAT RUN THE DAY. AND OF THIS. THAT ARE BEING. SO I SEE THAT. GOAL HERE TO ESTABLISH THAT. TO ALLOW COUNTIES FLAG. TO APPLY THAT FOR WORK IN THE IN TWO. KIND WHICH MEANS THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT. TO CONSTRUCT NEW FOR. IN THE NEAR TERM. THE BOARD SEATING CAN YOU KERR. IS REALIZE EXIST STAN THAT IT. FOR JUVENILE. AND OTHER. YOUTH FACILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED TO SERVE YOU WITH. AND WITH THE IDEA THAT THERE MIGHT BE MODIFICATIONS TO THOSE STANDARDS AND SPECIFIC TO SECURE YOUR TREATMENT FACILITIES. BUT JUST. TO YOU CAN OF REFLECTED BY AT IT IN. IT MAY NOT BE EVERY COW IS GOING CONSTRUCT BRAND FOR. TO MEET THAT. THAT SYSTEM IN THE BILL- I DON'T THAT THEY'RE GONNA CA. BRAND NEW FACILITY IT'S JUST AN OPTION IF THEY DO BUT THEY- HAVE TO EITHER CONTRACT OUT OR USE EXISTING FACILITIES AND TO- TAKE IN. THESE HIGH RISK VERY HIGH RISK INCARCERATED USE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THE LANGUAGES OF THE DATES WERE JUST SIMULTANEOUSLY TO SOMETHING THAT I NOTICED SO- THEY HAVE TO HAVE EITHER A NEW FACILITY BUILT AN EXISTING FACILITY MODIFIED. BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUT YET THE STATE BOARD OF COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ISN'T EVEN GOING TO COME OUT WITHTHE GUIDELINES. OR THE AND- AT THE STANDARDS UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO IT I THINK ON THE GROUND IT MAKES IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR COUNTIES TO COMPLY AT ALL. THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE THOUGH ANOTHER AGO WE FACED- A FEW YEARS AGO A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN WE REDUCE DJS AT AGE JURISDICTION- WELL. WHEN WE TALKED EDUCATE ENTRY PROVIDE THEY TOLD THAT THEY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO EFFECTIVELY REHABILITATE THE USE THAT THEY SERVE. AND THE KIDS WERE LEAVING DJJ WITHOUT FINISHING IN- PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE. JUST FOR EXAMPLE IF A AB IF ONE OF THE EASIEST- WAS- ASSIGNED OR REQUIRED TO ATTEND A- AND A EIGHTEEN MONTH DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAM OR IT. DID YOU KNOW I THIRTEEN MEANT. AND YOU KNOW DO. VIOLENCE PROGRAMMERS YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT- AND BUT THEY WERE ONLY IN THERE FOR LESS THAN A YEAR HOW DID THEY COMPLETE THAT PROGRAM IS THEIR RESOURCES. FOR THE COUNTY TO BE ABLE TO. COMPLETOS PROGRAM AND AFTER. THEY LEAVE THE FACILITY OR IS THAT GOING TO BE FIXED IN THIS BILL AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION THAT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL AND WE ARE PROVIDING RESOURCES TO COUNTY IS TO SERVE THE REALIGNED USE THAT WOULD PRESUMABLY BE DURING THE PERIOD OF THEIR INCARCERATION- BUT DEFINITELY IN SPECIFICALLY IN THIS LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES. AND DESPITE THE ISSUE THAT YOU FLAG. SO HOW HOW ARE WE GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR REHABILITATION AND IF IT'S IF THE RECOMMENDATION FROM ALL THOSE INVOLVED. AND THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR YOUTH. NEEDS EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF TREATMENT OR FIFTEEN MONTHS OF TREATMENT OR WHATEVER IT IS AND THEIR THEIR ONE YEAR SO HOW DO WE MEET THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION. SURE AND I GUESS WE CAN ALL I. MAKE AND BURST. CAN YOU SPECIFIC REAL TO USE. AND SAID REALLY DO THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY. WITH THE LARGEST. AND. THE IN TO BE A TO A C. YOUTH AS A THERE HAS TO BE IN OF STUFF THAT OUR TEAM THE HOUSE BE FINE BY THE COURT THERE HAS TO BE IN INDIVIDUAL REFILL. PLAN THAT'S FOR. AND IN A BILL IT'S SORT OF A FRAMER FOR THOUGHT AND IN THE IN RE. PLAN PRESUME WHAT DISCUSS IN THAT- IN ADDITION TO A NUMBER OF IN THAT THIS PROGRAMMING THAT BE FROM TO THE- ANY KIND OF FORMULATE A PLAN. PRESUMABLY THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. VERY NICELY. OPERATION APART AND ENDS WITH MULTI. PART WOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE LENGTH OF THAT SENTENCE- IN DETERMINING. HOW THE REHABILITATION PLAN IS TO BE KIND OF CONSTRUCTED OR ROLLED OUT. AND JUST MY LAST QUESTION M. I KNOW IT'S IN THE ADULT FACILITIES BUT IS THE PLOT TECH COURT CASE- DOES IT HAVE ANY JURISDICTION OVER MOVING THESE YOUTH FROM FACILITY TO FACILITY OR TRANSITIONING THEM I NO WONDER THAT PLOT A COURT CASE THAT WE DISCUSSED YESTERDAY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DO INTAKE ANYMOREAT THE ADULT PENITENTIARIES AND THEN THEY ALSO COULD NOT MOVE INMATES FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER DOES THIS AFFECT- THESE- HEAVILY INCARCERATED OR USE AS WELL. APOLOGY SENATOR GROVE I NOT ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION BUT HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE. YOU I'M AWARE OF THAT AYE AYES AYE AYES HERE BUT TO- UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR AND MICHAEL I. IT. WHEN YOU SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER HANDS UP- BEFORE I CALL AND A SENATOR NIELSEN AGAIN SOON MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- HEY MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTIES AND YOU CAN GET THIS DATA. FROM- FROM DJJ OR FROM AT PSEC BUT MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTIES HALF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS FOR CLOSE TO TEN YEARS NOW BEEN SENDING. NO OR FEWER THAN FORTY FIVE USED TO OUR STATE DJJ FACILITIES AND LIKE I SAID THAT TREND HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT A DECADE. IN TWO DAYS THE POPULATION IN OUR DJ STATE RUN FACILITIES IS ABUSED IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED DOWN FROM A HIGH OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. JUST A DECADE AGO FOR TO IT YESTERDAY TO GO. AND THE LENGTH OF STAY IN DJJ IS THREE YEARS NO ONE GOES IN JUST FOR ONE YEAR BUT- BECAUSE OF THE DUE TO THE- ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO SIGNAL THAT WE ARE CLOSING THOSE STATE FACILITIES AND WE DID SO LAST YEAR. D. BY THE TIME THAT DJJ ACTUALLY CLOSES THERE WILL BE FAR FEWER YOUTH JUST ON THE NATURAL SO WHILE THERE WILL BE USED THAT COUNTIES WILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR- AND THOSE COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SENDING YOUTH TO DJJ FACILITIES WILL. IN CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM BUT IN MANY CASES WILL BE HANDLING- THE YOUTH AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST YOU KNOW FIVE SIX YEARS AND THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN RELYING ON THE DJJ FACILITIES WILL. PRIMARILY NOT ONLY BUT PRIMARILY HAVE NEW YOUTH OFFENDERS TO DEAL WITH RATHER THAN SO MANY THAT ARE CURRENTLY HOUSED ON AND THEN JUST TO ANOTHER- CLARIFICATION. CASE DOES NOT COVER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE JUSTICE. ON SENATE NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM FOR A SECOND TO OPERATE AND I WILL BE BRIEF. IT'S COME TO MIND. THAT WE HAVE A LEGAL PROBLEM HERE WE DON'T THE COUNTIES TO. WHAT THE LAST ADULT REALIGNMENT OCCURRED SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IN THE NEXT BUDGET THEREAFTER THE NEXT TO ACTUALLY I ASKED THE SECRETARY OF THE DOLPHINS OF CORRECTIONS AGENCY I SAID YOU KNOW- DEALING WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FEWER. INMATES AND PAROLEES. GET YOUR BUDGET HAS GONE UP. FOR YEARS THE HUE AND CRY WAS WE SHOULD TAKE THAT MONEY AND GIVE IT TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION. AS IF THERE WOULD BE A BIG DIVIDEND FOR REALIGNMENT. THERE WAS INTACT AS A SET COSTS WENT UP. WHAT WAS HIS RESPONSE THE COURT. INDEED THE COURTS HAVE HAD A HUGE IMPACT OF FEDERAL RECEIVER. CALLING THE SHOTS THE ADULT SYSTEM. WELL AT THE TIME I SUGGESTED TO THE CELTICS THOSE SAME INMATE LAWSUITS THAT ARE SO PLAGUE AND COST DEARLY. THE TREASURER OF THE STATE ARE GOING TO MORE RIGHT IN YOUR J. AS THEY HAVE. NOW THERE'S A WHOLE NEW THEIR- OF LAW THAT WOULD ON THE GOT. I DO NOT THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO MAKE THOSE COUNTIES HOLE FOR THE DECISION THE STATE MADE THAT IS OBLIGED THEM AND MADE THEM VULNERABLE TO THE LAWSUIT. I ASK THE QUESTION WHERE IS SHE SAID ON THIS. END OF THE NIGHT HERE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM THEM IN THE FUTURE. RIGHT SEEING NO OTHER HANDS A POST SORRY SENATOR STERN YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP GO AHEAD SENATOR STORY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SORRY FOR YEAH- ADD ME THROW MY HAND DOWN- CANNOT CAN I JUST ASK ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION- EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IN THE CLEAN UP AND ESPECIALLY IF THE FOCUS ON. TRAUMA INFORMED CARE HERE AND THAT THE FLEXIBILITIES THAT IS LEGISLATION TO AUTHORIZE IT TO THE POINT THAT I'M SURE YOU WERE MAKING AN ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS MAKING ABOUT. NOT JUST CONSTRUCTING NEW STANDALONE FACILITIES BUT ALSO DOING CREATIVE WORK AND- YOU KNOW PROBATION CAMPS OR RANCHES OR OTHER SITES AROUND THE STATE RIGHT NOW AT LEAST IN LA AND VENTURA COUNTY WE'VE GOT SOME. REALLY INSPIRING WORK THAT HAPPENS BUT YOU KNOW- A MIX OF FACILITY TYPE SO I LOVE THE FRAMEWORK HERE- MY QUESTION I GUESS DOVE TAILS ON SENATOR GROWS QUESTION- WHICH WHICH ABOUT WHICH REALLY GETS TO MISS YOU ITS POINT ABOUT THE- THE REHABILITATION PLAN AND HOW THAT BASELINE TERMS ESTABLISHED. BY THE BY THE COURTS SO- I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HOW. THE IS THAT WE'VE ALL- PREVIOUSLY AND- WHAT KIND OF FLEX IT EASE THIS CLEAN UP GIVES. IT MAYBE IT ON THE CALLS ISSUED LOOK AT BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW WORKING IN THE MAX UNITS AT ALAMEDA COUNTY. EARLY ON IN MY LONG CAREER IN IN IN UNITS WHERE THERE WAS NO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SUPPORT FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW IT WAS A VERY INCARCERATION ORIENTED. OPERATION AND REALLY SORT OF EXACERBATED TRAUMA BUT- IT TO THE POINT ABOUT. THE BASELINE SOMETIMES THESE YOUNG PEOPLE NEED LONGER TERM- SERVICES- AND YOU KNOW TO JUST CUT THEM OFF WHEN THEY'RE OUT AWARD SHIP AND SAY YOU'RE GOOD- OFTEN DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT THEY'RE FACING- AND SOME OF THOSE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES REQUIRE SORT OF ON GOING. SUPPORT EVEN BEYOND THAT PERIOD OF- OF EITHER DETENTION OR WARSHIP OR WHATEVER MAY BE SO I'M JUST WONDERING HOW. IS EVERYTHING IS THE DOES THE MONEY CUT OFF WHEN THE BASELINE TERM CUTS OFF OR IS THERE ANY FLEXIBILITY IN SORT OF UNDERLYING LAW OR IN THIS BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR. THAT KIND OF ONGOING SUPPORT SERVICE- IT'S NOT REENTRY IS NOT THE RIGHT TERM BUT THAT THAT KIND OF ONGOING CARE AND IT DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO BE MENTAL HEALTH. IS THAT REALLY NOT AT A DIFFERENT PART OF FUNDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THIS MONEY REALLY HAPPY IS FOCUSED ONLY ON THE FACILITY OR- THE DURING DURING THAT PERIOD OF THE BASELINE. OR MODIFIED BASELINE THAT THAT'S MY QUESTION JUST SEEING HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY WE GOT. BERMAN FINANCED YOU WANNA ADDRESS THAT. HI ALISON HEWITT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR STERN AND IF I CAN JUST HELP CLARIFY SO WHEN I SPEAK TO THREE LAST YEAR WE INCLUDED. APPROPRIATIONS EACH YEAR TO THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE REAL LINES YOUTH AND THERE IS NO SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ON NOT FINDING IT WOULD SAY OTHER THAN THAT THAT FUNDING IS DESIGNED FOR COUNTIES PROVIDE KIND OF APPROPRIATE REAL BILL ME REHABILITATIVE AND SUPERVISORY SERVICES TO THE YOUTH AND COUNTIES ARE GOING AT THE HOUSE LOOKS TO IN TERMS OF HOW TO DATE. AB ACCOMPLISHED AND SO DOES APPROPRIATE ARE THERE IS APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER USE THAN THE GOAL THERE IS A REALLY ASSET COUNTIES UP FOR SUCCESS IN TERMS OF- PROVIDING KIND OF SERVICES TO USE TO MEET THEIR KIND UNIQUE NEEDS AND I ACROSS THE BOARD AND- IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SERVICES AFTER A U. S. LEAVES THAT. LEAVES THAT COUNTY FACILITY I'M I THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO BETTER TO NOT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A SPECIFIC FOCUS OF THIS LEGISLATION. THERE SOME. PROPOSED THAT THE- ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN KIND OF LOOKING AT- IN OF TRYING. FACILITATE MORE HAND OFFS AND BIGGER THAN JUST OUT BY JUVENILES BY FOR ADULTS AS WELL. I'M SO THAT THERE CAN BE CONTINUE CARE BUT MY- EXPERIENCE THAT. AYE COLLEAGUES ON THE AND HUMAN SERVICES. I SIDE OF THE HOUSE WOULD BE. BETTER EXPERTS IN THEIR EIGHT TO X.
