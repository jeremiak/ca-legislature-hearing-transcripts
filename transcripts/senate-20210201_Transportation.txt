OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND YOUR CA TA FOR THE TOP. AND FOR THEIR EXPERT. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO MY COME. NUMBER THREE YOU ALL. SB FOR ONE ADDRESS AND- URGENT CRISIS MY DISTRICT WHILE ALSO PROVIDING A MODEL FOR DOUBLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THAT ALIGNS WITH GOVERNOR NUISANCE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO FOSTER HOUSING INNOVATION ON EXCESS STATE LAND AND RAPIDLY INCREASE HOUSING OPTIONS. SB FIFTY ONE PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO HOMEOWNERSHIP WELL ALLOWING FOR THE SALE OF CALTRANS PROPERTIES TO QUALIFIED HOUSING RELATED ENTITIES. SUCH AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND NONPROFIT HOUSING ENTITIES AT THE CALTRANS ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE. IN EXCHANGE FOR A GUARANTEE A PROVIDING FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF AFFORDABLE AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE OF THIS BILL TO THE RULES ON HOW THESE PROPERTIES ARE SOLD BY THE STATE. IS THAT WE ESTABLISH THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR H. E. R. H. ARI'S AT THE ORIGINAL CALTRANS CALTRANS PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF AFFORDABILITY. UNDER SB FIFTY ONE THE HOMES WOULD BE SOLD BY CALTRANS AS FOLLOWS. FIRST ALL SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES. PRESENTLY OCCUPIED BY THEIR FORMER OWNERS WILL BE OFFERED TO THOSE OWNERS. AT THE FAIR MARKET VALUE. SECOND ALL SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES SHALL BE OFFERED AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE TO THE PRESENT OCCUPANTS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE PROPERTY FOR TWO OR MORE YEARS AND WHO ARE LOW OR MODERATE INCOME. THIRD IF A CURRENT LONG TERM TENANT IN GOOD STANDING IS OVER THE INCOME LIMITS AND HAS RESIDED AT THE PROPERTY FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE. WE AMEND THE RIVER AND A WATERFALL SO THAT THESE TENANTS HAVE THE FIRST RIGHT TO PURCHASE THEIR FOR. RENTAL AT FAIR MARKET VALUE. AND THAT IS THE PRICE REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW. THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE THEN GOES TO THE HRB. AT ORIGINAL ACQUISITION PRICE. AS IS. BOB WITHOUT ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING WITH A FIFTY FIVE YEAR COVENANT. SB FIFTY ONE ALLOWS AN HRV THE BY THE PROPERTY AT THE ORIGINAL PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR REMODELING THEM FIXING THEM UP AND KEEPING THEM UP. OF GRATED AND AFFORDABLE. THIS BILL PROTECTS AGAINST DISPLACEMENT. CURRENT TENANTS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A FIRST RIGHT OF OCCUPANCY REGARDLESS OF WHICH ENTITY PURCHASES THE PROPERTY. COLLEAGUES SEVENTY YEARS AGO THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEGAN DISPLACING FAMILIES AND ALTER THE COMMUNITY OF EL SERENO FOR FREEWAY EXPANSION. CALTRANS BOUGHT PROPERTIES WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE FAMILIES IN THE QUARTER. DISRUPTED THE ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FABRIC OF THIS PREDOMINANTLY LATINO COMMUNITY. AFFECTED JUST A YEAR AGO IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THE LEGISLATURE DECLARED THERE WOULD BE NO EXTENSION FOR INTERSTATE SEVEN TEN. WITH OVER pVACANT NEARLY HALF THE CALTRAIN HOMES IN EL SERENO AND MANY IMPORTANT CONDITIONS WE HAVE AN URGENT OPPORTUNITY. TO REPAIR AND IMPROVE THE HOUSING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AN INCREASE LONG TORN TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HOMES IN LOS ANGELES ARE IN THIS COMMUNITY OF EL SERENO. OF THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR HOMES NEARLY HALF ARE VACANT. NOT ONLY IS THIS CRITICAL FOR THE COMMUNITY IT IS ALSO FISCALLY PRUDENT RIGHT NOW CALTRANS IS REQUIRED TO FIX THE HOMES IN ORDER TO SELL THE PROPERTIES AS MOST OF THESE HOMES WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR HAD A BIT HABITABILITY STANDARDS. CALTRANS IS ALSO INCURRING SIGNIFICANT COSTS EVERYDAY TO PREVENT THE HOMES FROM BEING OCCUPIED. THESE HOMES IN THE CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE HAZARDOUS AND NOT SAFE FOR LIVING IN WE WANT TO REPAIR THESE HOMES MAKE THEM RESPECTFUL DIGNIFIED. LIVING SPACES WHILE EXPANDING LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY. THIS BILL SEEKS TO MOVE OWNERSHIP AWAY. CALTRANS INTO THE HANDS OF INDIVIDUAL OWNERS. SECURE LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY WHILE ENSURING CURRENT CURRENT CALTRANS TENANTS ARE PROTECTED. RESIDENTS RENTING APARTMENTS AND HOMES IN THE SEVEN TEN QUARTER DESERVE FAIR TREATMENT AND STABLE HOUSING SB FIFTY ONE WILL PROVIDE A LONG TERM SOLUTION WILL BUILD WEALTH IN EQUITY IN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP.

ALRIGHT I NINETY MINUTES I'D LOVE LEVINE MY NAME IS ANGELA FLORES I AM A LONG TIME TENANTS- MY FAMILY'S BEEN LIVING IN OUR HOUSE IN SOUTH PASADENA FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL I THINK IT'S- INFURIATING IT'S FRUSTRATING- AFTER- GROWING UP. WITH SO MANY TENANTS WHO HAD TO FIGHT FOR THEIR HOME A LOT OF THOSE TENANTS ARE OLDER AND HAVING TO FEED THEIR GRIEVANCES HAVING TO SEE THERE ARE PEOPLE PASSING AWAY UNFORTUNATELY AND TO NOT BE CONSULTED BY MISTER MIRACLE IS VERY INFURIATING AND RIDICULOUS. SO I THINK IT'S- IT'S RIDICULOUS ALSO THAT THERE IS- AND A GROUP CALLED THE INCIDENT ALL COMMUNITY LAND TRUST TENANTS LED AND RESIDENT LANDON THAT SHE HASN'T TALKED TO AND THAT- THAT GROUP IS WILLING TO TAKE THE PROPERTIES AND TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT POLITICAL PROPERTIES AND REACH READ- RESTORED THEN SO THAT IS BY THE TENANTS AND A LOT OF THE INFORMATION THAT SHE SAID WAS THE FIRST TIME EVER HEARING ABOUT IT.

THANK YOU- I AMERICA CALTRANS TENET ALSO A MEMBER OF OUR GROUP IN ASSOCIATION WITH IT AND- WHEN SENATOR DORADO STROKE IT ALL SOUNDED VERY REASONABLE AND- WE WOULD BE IN AGREEMENT WITH THOSE THINGS BUT THOSE THINGS ARE ALREADY- ALREADY INCLUDED IN EXISTING LEGISLATION BUT THE ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN SB FIFTY ONE. HE WAS MORE LIKE AN ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF PARCELS AVAILABLE TO HOUSING RELATED ENTITIES- AND COULD POSSIBLY TAKE AWAY THE RIGHTS OF TENANTS WHO ARE ALREADY THERE- HI IT WOULD BE CONTINUE TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE ALTERING OF COMMUNITY AND ALLOW CALTRANS TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR- UNFAIR AND UNFOUNDED MUSICIANS- IT ALSO WILL- ARBITRARILY ELIMINATES THE RIGHT TO TENANTS TO FORM CO OPS TO PURCHASE CALTRANS HOMES. AND ONLY IN EL SERENO- CURRENTLY DORADO HAS DEBATED NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS FOR COMMUNITY DIALOGUE AN IMPORT- IT SEEMS TO SERVE SPECIAL THE CHANGES IN SB FIFTY ONE. SEEM TO SERVE SPECIAL INTERESTS GROUPS RATHER THAN THE TENANTS- IT GIVES PRIORITY TO RENTAL AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT OVER THE RIGHTS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THE RIGHT OF THE COMMUNITY TO DETERMINE ITS OWN FUTURE- AND IT DOES NOTHING TO CHALLENGE CALTRANS SOME WORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. HOLD THE WORST PLAN OF THIS BY DE LEON. ANYWAY I WANTED TO SHOW ALL THAT IN SO ON IT FACE SOUNDS GREAT- WHAT SENATOR DRAW WAS SOME GOOD.

I ANY UNDERSTANDING DORSEN OF THE OF THE BILL TO SPEND BUT- I THINK IT. YOU KNOW THIS BILL RELIES ON MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN REGARDS THAT YOU. BY COMPARISON ITSELF ARBITRARILY LIMITS THE RIGHTS OF TENANTS TO FORM COOPERATIVES IN ORDER TO BECOME HOMEOWNERS IN LINE WITH THE- LEGISLATION. IT DOESN'T ONLY IN EL SERENO WHICH IS BLATANTLY DISCRIMINATORY IN FACT EVERYTHING THAT SB FIFTY ONE CLAIMS TO ACHIEVE CAN ALREADY BE DONE UNDER EXISTING LEGISLATION. WHICH APPLIES TO THE ENTIRE CORRIDOR INCLUDING SOUTH PASADENA IN PASADENA. I URGE THE SENATE TO OPPOSE THIS DEEPLY FLAWED BILL AND- I WOULD CHALLENGE THE SENATOR TO EXPLAIN WHY DIDN'T THE EXPANDED TO THE ENTIRE COURT.

ALL THE LAST YEAR ON THIS BILL ON AND I THINK DUE TO COVER THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES THERE BY THE TIME I WANT TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE CALLS. AND LETTERS OF MY DISTRICT HAS RECEIVED IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL- SO I KNOW THERE'S SOME EDUCATION TO BE DONE IN THAT RESPECT IN SOME MEETINGS THAT PERHAPS NEED TO HAPPEN JUST TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE INFORMED AND- ITEMS CLARIFIED BUT I DID HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING. ALL LAST YEAR WITH SENATOR DRAWS ON. YOU DON'T REALLY GET POLICIES THAT CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING HELP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND IN PARTICULAR HELP. LOW INCOME FAMILIES STAY IN THEIR HOMES SO I KNOW THAT. THIS BILL WAS MEANT TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BY TWO CLEARLY THERE'S SOME AGAIN EDUCATION TO BE DONE AND- AND SOME MEETINGS TO BE HAD AND SO I TRUST MY COLLEAGUES WITH MY COLLEAGUE- WILL DO THAT SO WITH THAT I WILL.

MADAM CHAIR THAT THERE IS A PRIORITY AND TO THE RIVER TO THE ACT THAT THAT ALLOWS THESE HOUSES TO BE OFFERED. BACK TO THE FORMER OWNERS AT THE PRICE THAT WAS PAID AND ACCORDING TO OUR ANALYSIS JUST MAY BE IN THE FIFTIES IN THE SIXTIES SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT EL SERENO BUT I KNOW IN. IN THE BAY AREA YOU TALKED AND THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR HOUSES COULD BE CHEAPER TO BUY A HOUSE IN THIS AREA IF THAT WAS ACTUALLY ACQUIRED IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES. IT WAS THE BY A CAR BOMB. AND AN L. CALTRANS HAS BEEN HANGING ONTO THESE FOR EVER SO I THINK I UNDERSTAND. WERE YOU UNDER THE RIVER. BERTIE ACT.

AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS SOON AS WE HAVE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS MOVE THIS PROPERTY SO THAT THOSE WHO ARE IN A POSITION WANT TO AND ARE TENANTS CAN BUY THESE HOMES AND THOSE WHO CAN'T CAN STAY IN THERE AS LONG AS IT'S AFFORDABLE THERE IT'S THEY'RE PROTECTED AS TENANTS TO STAY THERE IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO RENT.
