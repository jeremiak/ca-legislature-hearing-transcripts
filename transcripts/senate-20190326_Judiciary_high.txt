A TIME COMES FOR THAT TO BE HEARD SO THE FIRST MEASURE TODAY THAT WE WILL BE HEARING IS SB. THIRTY FILE ITEM ONE BY SENATOR WIENER THE DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP -- BILL. AND DOES MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO OPPOSITION. A TIMELY FILED TO THIS MEASURE. AND THAT -- SENATOR WINNER YOU WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE FIFTEEN COLLEAGUES. IN COMMON NUMBER NINE IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT VERY GOOD A GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR WIENER YOU MAY PROCEED I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING DILIGENTLY -- AND WE ARE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT -- SO -- COLORS THIS IS A A BILL -- TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE FULL EQUAL TREATMENT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WHEN IT COMES TO CALIFORNIA'S. A DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP A REGISTRY. THE NICER PARTNERSHIP REGISTRY WAS CREATED -- BACK WHEN. LGBT PEOPLE COULD NOT LEGALLY GET MARRIED IN CALIFORNIA SO WE CREATED A SEPARATE FORM OF REYES RELATIONSHIP RECOGNITION IN THE FORM OF THE MASSIVE PARTNERSHIP. FOR SAME SEX COUPLES. WHICH WAS ALSO EXTENDED TO OPPOSITE SEX COUPLES -- AGE SIXTY TWO AN OLDER -- FOR REASONS OF SOCIAL SECURITY. NOW WE HAVE FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY OF COURSE FIVE AND BUT BUT THE DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP REGISTRY CONTINUES TO EXCLUDE -- OPPOSITE GENDER COUPLES UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO THERE'S NO RATIONAL. BASIS FOR THAT -- AND WE SHOULD BE EXTENDING -- THIS CHOICE -- TO EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IT CETERA -- AND IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHOICES ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP SOME PEOPLE WANT TO GET MARRIED. SOME PEOPLE DON'T SOME PEOPLE I PREFER NOT TO GET MARRIED BUT STILL WANT TO HAVE A BASIC LEVEL OF RELATIONSHIP. PROTECTION PROTECTION FOR THEIR CHILDREN -- AND SO IT MAKES SENSE FOR TO PASS THIS BILL AND TO EXTEND DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS HI TO ALL CALIFORNIANS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE -- AND WITH THE TODAY'S TIME MARTIN FROM QUALITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- TAMMY MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA SERVING THE STATE'S LGBT Q. POPULATION. AND WE'RE PROUD SUPPORTERS OF SB THIRTY WHICH REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S RESPECT FOR THE VALUES AND LONG TERM PLANS OF ITS DIVERSE POPULATION. AND PROVIDES GREATER FREEDOM THE FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. EQUALITY CALIFORNIA LED THE WAY IN OUR STATE'S QUEST TO ACHIEVE MARRIAGE EQUALITY FOR SAME SEX COUPLES. AND AS PART OF THAT WORK THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HELD THAT STATE LAWS SHOULDN'T TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THEREFORE CALIFORNIA'S DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP REGISTRY IS OUTDATED. AND SHOULD NO LONGER BE ONLY AVAILABLE TO SAME SEX COUPLES OR OPPOSITE SEX COUPLES OVER AGE SIXTY TWO IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL COUPLES. AND NOT EVERYONE WISHES TO ENTER INTO MARRIAGE BUT ALL COUPLES SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILIES RECOGNIZED AND PROTECTED. SB THIRTY HELP THEM DO THAT. SERVER THESE REASONS EQUALITY CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS SB THIRTY AND URGES THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU. VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU WOULD STEP FORWARD. BECCA KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW SPIRALING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARY HYATT FROM CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DIET SHOULD THERE ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR BORCHERS. THE CATCHER ONE APPRECIATED. GLOW IN APPRECIATED CHAD JUST A MOMENT AGO -- WANTED JUST KIND OF CONFIRM IN THE RECORD THAT -- FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO COULD BE MISLED -- BY JUST THE THE SYMBOLISM ATTACHED. TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT DESIGNATIONS ARE ONLY SIR WE KIND OF CUT THROUGH THAT -- AND GET THE HEART OF THE MATTER SO -- HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES HAVE THE OPTION OF MARRIAGE. HOMOSEXUAL COUPLES HAVE THE OPTION ARE FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS -- HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS IF THEY WERE OVER SIXTY OF ONE OF THOSE OVER -- SIXTY TWO SO. UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN THIS IS ALMOST LIKE AN INVERSE EQUAL PROTECTION ISSUE. THAT YOU'RE ENABLING HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES TO HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT HOMOSEXUAL COUPLES HAVE FOR ANY VARIETY OF REASON WITH TAX REASONS -- PROPERTY -- SUCCESSION ISSUES -- IS THAT A FAIR -- FRAMEWORK OF THE ISSUES YEAH YES WE WANT TO MAKE. SURE OF THAT -- THAT HETEROSEXUAL -- PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTY TO HAVE THE SAME ABILITY TO ACCESS MISTER PARTNERSHIPS AS LGBT PEOPLE OR PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO OKAY. I WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU KNOW IF ANYONE'S LISTENING TO THIS THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE VIRTUE OF THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE THIS IS ABOUT THIS IS A LEGAL ISSUE THIS IS ABOUT. EQUAL PROTECTION FOR THOSE COUPLES THAT WISH TO MAINTAIN A UNION OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE BUT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. APPROVED FOR THEIR OWN PRIVATE PERSONAL REASONS -- WANT TO HAVE THEIR RIGHTS PROTECTED FOR THOSE UNDER SIX SIXTY TWO RIGHT AND AND IN FACT WE'VE ALREADY MADE THE POLICY CHOICE THAT HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES SIXTY TWO AND OLDER. CAN BE DOMESTIC PARTNER BECAUSE PRESUMABLY AS I UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE OF NOT WANTING TO FORFEIT SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. SO WE'VE ALREADY MADE THE CHOICE TO GIVE SOME OPPOSITE SEX COUPLES. DID ACCESS TO MR PARTNERSHIPS -- WE WANT TO GIVE ALL OF THEM THAT OPTION OKAY THIS IS THE TO BE AN EQUAL PROTECTION ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK THAT CLARIFIES SHOULDN'T I DO THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MOTION BY SENATOR STERN SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS THOSE SENATOR WINNER YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL THE GREAT CLOSE VERY GOOD. MADAM SECRETARY THE MEASURE IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE FORGES. OR JUST AYE ALAN. ALLEN I COVER HERO. HI MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN. STERN AYE UMBERG [inaudible] WHITE HOUSE. THE VOTE THE IS SIX TWO ZERO WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SIR WIENER. OUR NEXT ITEM UP IS FILE ITEM THREE SENATOR MITCHELL SP ONE EIGHTY EIGHT ON DISCRIMINATION AND HAIRSTYLES. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR LONG TIME NO SEE. pTODAY PRESIDING THIS BILL FIRST SITS. TO EDUCATE PERHAPS MANY VIEW ABOUT THE UNIQUENESS OF BLACK HEARING THE UNIQUENESS OF OUR TEXTURE. AND IT'S THAT CHALLENGE FROM COMMON HELD MYTHS ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES PROFESSIONALISM IN THE WORKPLACE. WE'RE GONNA DO THAT TODAY THROUGH OUR BILL SB ONE EIGHT EIGHT THE CROWN ACT WHICH WE HOPE WILL CREATE A RESPECTFUL AND OPEN WORKPLACE FOR NATURAL HAIR. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD YOUNG MAN HAD HIS LOCKS VIOLENTLY CUT. BY AN OFFICIAL IN THE MIDDLE OF A WRESTLING TOURNAMENT. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND I EXPECT MANY OF US IN THIS VERY ROOM WATCH THAT VIDEO FOOTAGE. IT'S VISCERAL EMOTIONAL AND DEVASTATING FOR THE YOUNG MAN. AND ALL WHO WITNESSED IT. ON THAT DAY WHICH I'M SURE HE IN THIS FAMILY WILL REMEMBER FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE. THE REFEREE ALLEN MALONEY GAVE THE CHILD AN ULTIMATUM. LOSE YOUR HAIR. AND WITH THAT YOUR PERSONALLY RACIAL IDENTITY. AND DIGNITY OR LOSE THE MATCH. LEADING HIS TEAM COACH AND SCHOOL DOWN. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED BECAUSE THAT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME HE'S WRESTLED ON THE AFTER THE SCHOOL THAT THERE IS HEAD GAR THAT CAN BE WORN. THAT MANY ATHLETES WHERE -- TO COVER THEIR HERE AND THAT REFEREE FOR WHATEVER REASON CHOSE TO NOT ALLOW HIM TO WEAR THE HEAD GEAR. AND REQUIRED THAT HIS LOCKS. AT THE MOMENT BE CUT. WITHOUT ANY CONSULTATION WITH HIS PARENTS. HE WON THE MATCH. BUT SOMEWHAT ARGUE THIS PERSONALIZED ENTITY. WITH CALLED INTO QUESTION. THAT'S A SITUATION THAT NO PARENT WOULD WANT TO FORCE IN THEIR CHILD AND CERTAINLY NO TEACHER COACH OR MENTOR EVER SHOULD. IT WAS SHOCKING FOR ME TO WITNESS. AND THAT CERTAINLY WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME A PERSON OF COLOR IN AMERICA WAS FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR RACIAL OR ETHNIC IDENTITY. AND THEIR ACADEMIC OR PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT. THERE ARE MANY CASES OF BLACK EMPLOYEES AND APPLICANTS DENIED EMPLOYMENT OR PROMOTION AND EVEN TERMINATED BECAUSE OF EITHER THEIR CORN ROLLS BRAIDS OR LOCK. I HAVE HEARD HEART BREAKING REPORTS OF YOUNG BLACK GIRLS HUMILIATED AND SENT HOME FROM SCHOOL. BECAUSE THEIR HAIR WAS DEAN TO CALL ON THE RULING AND A DISTRACTION TO OTHERS. CAN WE TRULY SAY EQUITY EXISTS WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO REMAIN IN CLASS AND LEARN BECAUSE THE CHARACTERISTICS NATURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR HAIR. WHERE IS THE JUSTICE WHEN BLACK MEN AND WOMEN ARE DENIED ACCESS TO ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT? BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY CHOOSE TO WEAR THEIR HAIR. HERE -- CENTRIC STANDARDS OF BEAUTY HAVE HELD THE UNDERPINNINGS OF AMERICAN CULTURE SINCE THE FOUNDING OF OUR SOCIETY. DETERMINING AND INFORMING WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE AND ATTRACTIVE IN THE MEDIA ACADEMIC SETTINGS AND THAT WORK. FOR THE PURPOSE OF SB. ONE EIGHTY EIGHT IS TO COLLECTIVELY DEFINE AND PROTECT WHAT WE'RE CALLING PROTECTIVE HERE. BRAIDS LOCKS OR TWO WITH. BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO WEAR OUR HAIR AS WE CHOOSE. THE COURT IN E. E. O. C. VERSUS. A CATASTROPHE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS IN ROGERS VERSES AMERICAN AIRLINES INC IN PIP'S VERSES WILD ADVENTURES INK AND MANY OTHER CASES HAVE RULE TO ALLOW. WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ANY PRESENTATION OF NATURAL HAIR THAT IS NOT AN AFRO AN AFRO IS CURRENTLY A PROTECTED CATEGORY. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TRULY DISTRACTING HAIRSTYLES. DEPENDS ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE. COLOR RAINBOW COLORED DRESSES OR PEAK MOHAWKS WERE SPEAKING OF GROOMED HAIR STYLES LIKE MY LOCKS THAT WOULD WITHOUT QUESTION FIT AN IMAGE OF PROFESSIONALISM. IF BIAS OR NEGATIVE STEREO TYPES WERE NOT INVOLVED. DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT RACE NEUTRAL WORKPLACE GREEN POLICIES THAT BAND BRAIDS TWIST CORALS UNLOCKS MAY APPLY TO EMPLOYEES OR APPLICANTS OF ALL RACES HOWEVER THEY HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON BLACK MEN AND WOMEN. THIS MEANS THESE POLICIES ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO EXCLUDE BLACKS INDIVIDUALS IN THE WORKPLACE THE PEOPLE OF ANY OTHER RACE. MANY BLACK EMPLOYEES WILL TELL YOU IF GIVEN THE CHANCE THAT THE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN WHAT SOCIETY IS DEEMED A PROFESSIONAL IMAGE WHILE PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND INTEGRITY OF THEIR HERE REMAINS A DEFINING AND pWORK EXPERIENCE. NOT USUALLY SHARED BY THEIR NON BLACK PEERS. BLACK EMPLOYEES SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CONFORM TO A NON INCLUSIVE IDEA OF A PROFESSIONAL IMAGE AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR PERSONAL CHOICE CHOICE OR EVEN THE HEALTH OF THEIR HERE. IT'S TWENTY NINETEEN AT ANY LAW THAT SANCTIONS THE JOB DESCRIPTION THAT IMMEDIATELY EXCLUDES ME FROM A POSITION. OR ANYONE ELSE THAT CHOOSES TO WEAR THEIR HAIR THIS NATIONAL FORM NOT BECAUSE OF MY CAPACITY TO DO THE JOB BECAUSE OF HOW I CHOOSE TO WEAR MY HAIR. IS LONG OVERDUE FOR REFORM. I HAVE HERE WITH ME TODAY. PROFESSOR WINDY GREEN FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW IN ALABAMA. WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY A LICENSED. COSMETOLOGIST AKELA HATS FALL WHO OWNS A SALON HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND WHOSE ENTIRE CLIENTELE OR PEOPLE CHOOSE TO WEAR THEIR HAIR NATURALLY. LET ME SAY THAT WENDY IS THE LEADING EXPERT ON HERE DISCRIMINATION CASES AND WAS QUOTED IN THE EOC VERSUS CMS COURT OPINION. I ASKED THAT TELL YOU GIVE THEM THE TIME A LOT OF TO SPEAK AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ON SB. ONE EIGHTY EIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME AND IF YOU WOULD TO LIMIT YOUR REMARKS TWO TWO MINUTES EACH OF HER QUESTIONS WE WILL THEN. PROCEED TO ASK THEM GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS WENDY GREEN AND I AM A LEADING ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAW SCHOLAR TEACHER AN ADVOCATE I GRADUATED FROM XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA -- WITH AN HONORS IN ENGLISH AND A DOUBLE MINOR IN AFRICA AMERICAN STUDIES AS WELL WELL AS SPANISH I ALSO EARNED BY JURIS DOCTORATE FROM TULANE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW AND A MASTERS OF LAW DEGREE FROM THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. WHERE SPECIALIZED IN COMPARED OF SLAVERY AND RACE RELATIONS AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW? I HAVE SPENT MUCH OF MY CAREER AS A LW PROFESSOR AND SCHOLAR ADVOCATING FOR GREATER AWARENESS AROUND IN CIVIL PROTECTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER DISCRIMINATION DUE TO THESE UNCHECKED DISCRIMINATORY GROWING POLICIES. AND WORKPLACES AND BEYOND NAMELY POLICIES THAT STIGMATIZE NATURAL HAIRSTYLES AS UNPROFESSIONAL DISTRACTING EXTREME EXCESSIVE IN ON CAN'T POLICIES THAT REQUIRE AFRICAN DISSIDENTS TO CUT OFF THEIR HERE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT NATURALLY GROWS. OR IN THE CASES OF AFRICAN DESCENT IT WOMEN AND GIRLS. GROOMING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE THAT THEY DON STREET HERE USUALLY ACHIEVED THROUGH TOXIC CHEMICALS EXTREME HEAT STYLING WEEKS AND WEEKS WHICH ARE OFTEN TIMES EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING TO MAINTAIN. MORE OVER THE OFTEN RESULT IN PERMANENT HAIR AND SCALP DAMAGE AS WELL AS PERMANENTLY AND OR TEMPORARY HERE LOS. NATURAL HAIR BANDS LEAVE AFRICAN DESCENT AT WOMEN AND GIRLS IN A PRECARIOUS CATCH TWENTY TWO EITHER DON YOUR NATURAL HAIR AT THE RISK OF LAWFULLY. BEING DEPRIVED OF AN EMPLOYMENT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OR AN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY OR DON STRAIGHT HERE AT THE RISK OF AN DURING CONSEQUENTIAL HARMS TO YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL IN FACT IN PHYSIOLOGICAL WELL BEING. AS A SENATOR MITCHELL MITCHELL MENTIONED MUCH OF MY SCHOLARSHIP AND BECAUSE HE HAS FOCUSED ON CRITIQUING FEDERAL COURT DECISIONS THAT FAIL TO TREAT WORKPLACE BANS GAINST AFRICAN DESCENDANTS. NATURAL HAIR STYLES AS RACE DISCRIMINATION AND THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO AN APPLICATION OF AN OUTDATED -- RULE CALLED IMMUTABILITY DOCTRINE AND I I CAN SAVE THAT FOR LATER IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BUT UNDER THAT DOCTRINE A SENATOR MITCHELL MENTION OF FEDERAL COURTS HAVE PROCLAIMED THAT AFTER OWES ART IN IMMUTABLE RACIAL CHARACTERISTIC. BUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS HAIR SPLITTING DISTINCTION IT ENGENDERS AN UNJUSTIFIABLE OUTCOME IF AN EMPLOYER DENIES AN AFRICAN DESCENDED A JOB BECAUSE SHE ADORNS AN AFRO. THE EMPLOYER ENGAGES IN UNLAWFUL RACE DISCRIMINATION HOW OLD HOWEVER THE MOMENT THAT SAME EMPLOYEE TWIST LOCKS OR BRAIDS HER AFRO AND SUFFERS ADVERSE TREATMENT ON THOSE GROUNDS. THE EMPLOYERS DISCRIMINATION IS DEEMED LAWFUL AND BEYOND THE SCOPE SCOPE OF FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS STATUTES. AND WHAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL DOES IS IT FEELS THE GAP HERE WITH RESPECT TO PROTECTION FOR RACE DISCRIMINATION PLAINTIFFS IN THESE GROOMING CODES CASES. AND AND SO BASED ON CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY OF STANDING STRONG AND IT'S PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THERE REALLY IS NO BETTER STATE TO NOT ONLY HAVE THIS DISCUSSION BUT ALSO TO TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION TOWARD CORRECTING. THIS INEQUALITY UNDER THE LAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS A KILLER HATCHET FALL. ON THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF SACRED CROWNS BRIDGES DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO I HAVE A THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLIENTS AND I'VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS. OF THIS. OUR HAIR IS MORE THAN A HAIRSTYLE IT IS A LIFESTYLE. AND WITHOUT BE IN AND I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS TIMES WHERE PEOPLE COME IN AND SAID I'VE GOT TO GET A JOB. I'VE BEEN OUT TO SEVERAL INTERVIEWS AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET A JOB SO I'VE HAD TO CUT THEIR LOCKS OFF. OR CUT OFF THEIR HERE IN SOME NATURAL WAYS SO THAT THEY AGO AND DAMAGE THEIR HERE BY DOING PERMITS OR OTHER. OF THERMAL TEXT ARISING OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THEM LATER ON AND THEY STILL TO GET THE JOB. SO I REALLY THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE OF IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO ATTRIBUTE. A WHOLE THEY ARE ARE HERE FOR MANY YEARS GENERATIONS CENTURIES ARE HERE IS WHAT IS DEFINED AS AFRICAN PEOPLE -- AND THAT IS WHERE IN OUR HAIR IS MORE THAN A HAIRSTYLE IT ACTUALLY DENOTES WHO WE ARE IN AFRICA TO NOTABLE TRIBES WE'RE FROM. IT'S NOT A WHOLE WHAT KIND OF JOB WE HAVE WHAT KIND OF FAMILY WERE FROM SO IT HAS NOT CHANGED THAT IS ONE THING ABOUT OUR CULTURE. THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE THROUGH THE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF OPPRESSION AND BEING SUBJECTED TO WHITE SUPREMACY AS WELL AS EURO CENTRIC STANDARDS OF BEAUTY. SO BEING ABLE TO WEAR OUR HAIR NATURAL IS IMPORTANT. I DEAL WITH THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY IN TERMS OF PEOPLE HAVING OTHER HAIR DONE NATURAL -- A COSMETOLOGIST BY TRADE AS WELL AS A LOT TUITION UNLOCKED AS IN THE SOMEONE WHO LOCKS OR TWISTS OR BRAIDS NATURAL HAIR. AND IT'S WONDERFUL FOR PEOPLE IS MORE THAN WHEN THEY COME IN TO GET THEIR HAIR LOT THEY NOT ONLY DO PART WORRY ABOUT THEM NOT ONLY LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE HERE IS GOING TO DO. NATURALLY BUT IT ENDS UP INTERNALLY IT TURNS ON SOMETHING IN THEM. AND THAT ACTUALLY GETS THEM TO INTERNAL Là INTERNALLY -- FIND OUT MORE AND BLOSSOM FOR WHO THEY ACTUALLY ARE AS A PEOPLE SO BEING ABLE TO OF SO NOT BEING ABLE. TO TO DO THAT AND GET A JOB OR NOT B. AND PROMISED A JOB IS JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT -- IT'S BEEN A PRACTICE BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUBJECTED. TO THINK AND I CAN ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS IF YOU OUR PRE SHE'D ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT IF YOU WOULD JUST COME ON UP TO THE MICROPHONE IN COME UP. BUT ONE BEHIND THE OTHERS WELL.

SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS -- THAT ACTUALLY IS A PERFECT SEGUE -- THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY IT TAKES A LOOK AT THOSE SITUATIONS IN THE EMPLOYMENT ARENA AND I AM WONDERING I THINK WE CHATTED ABOUT THIS IF YOU WOULD -- TO CONSIDER IF SOME ADVOCATES HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT PERHAPS THE BILL SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO COVER SCHOOLS AS WELL. HAVE YOU GIVEN THOUGHT TO THAT ABSOLUTELY WE'VE GOT DRAFT LANGUAGE I BELIEVE BACK FROM COUNCIL -- WE WANTED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATION WITH SOME OF THE EDUCATION NOW -- STAKEHOLDERS I WAS GLAD TO HEAR -- THE THE LAST ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE ADULTS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM TEACHERS AND ALL WOULD BE COVERED UNDER SB. ONE EIGHTY EIGHT IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THE EDUCATION COLD THE STUDENTS WOULD BE THE ONLY ONES LEFT OUT AND SO WE ABSOLUTELY ARE COMMITTED TO MOVING THAT LANGUAGE FOR IT -- AND WILL BE DOING SO. SHE EIGHT THE EXHAUSTIVE DETAIL INCLUDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THAT -- RECOMMENDATION AND WILL ABSOLUTELY BE ACCEPTING OF CANDLES AMENDMENTS I THINK OF THIS YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A WRESTLER AND WHAT A HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE THAT MUST'VE BEEN FOR HIM AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD HAVE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THAT SO. I'M DELIGHTED THAT YOU ARE. GOING TO EXPAND THE MEASURE -- AND I WOULD LIKE -- TO JUST TO CONFIRM THE BILL STILL DOES ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO IMPOSE REASONABLE NON DISCRIMINATORY GRAMMY POLICIES IS THAT CORRECT ABSOLUTELY -- MADAM CHAIR IF YOU WORK IN FOOD SERVICE ARE YOU WORK -- AROUND MACHINERY THAT REQUIRES LONG HERE BE PULLED UP OR HEARING THAT IT THIS BILL HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THOSE KINDS OF WORKPLACE APPROPRIATE -- STRATEGIES THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT THANK YOU. OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR STERN MOVE THE BILL GOV SENATOR CAFIERO. MADAM CHAIR -- SENATOR YOU INDICATED THAT YOU WANTED TO EDUCATE US AND I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB I'D LIKE TO JOIN YOU ASA CO AUTHOR IF I APPRECIATE THAT MADAM THANK YOU. US SENATOR BOARD JUST. MAYBE I'LL PERCENT OF MY QUESTION TWO ONE TWO OUR ACADEMIC PANELIST. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY BY THE WAY SO I KIND OF WANTED TO GET A SENSE -- ON THE DIVISION OF THE LINE THAT SEPARATES RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION OR RELIGIOUS IDENTITY FROM RACE. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU KNOW IF IF YOU WERE A SEEK. AND YOU WERE YOUR HAIR OUT. THAT WOULD BE PROTECTED UNDER A RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. OR IF YOU WERE STATE IN AN ACIDIC TO SAME THING RIGHT -- SO THAT'S PROTECTED IN IN THAT AREA BUT IN TERMS OF RACE. THE THE GENESIS OF YOUR PROPOSAL TODAY IS THAT IS NOT COVERED UNDER ANY RELIGIOUS EXPRESSIONS JUST. BIOLOGICAL ON STYLE OF STYLE OF HAIR AND IT'S IT'S A BIOLOGICAL TEXTURE OF HAIR AND IT'S THE THE POINT IS THAT I AM CHOOSING NOT TO ARTIFICIALLY STRAIGHTEN IT. TO KIND OF MEAT WHAT WE HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE HISTORICALLY AS THE YEAR OLD DEFINITION OF WHAT'S PROFESSIONAL IN THE WORKPLACE AND SO THE BIOLOGICAL PIECE IS THE TEXTURE AND CHOOSING TO WEAR MY HAIR IN ITS NATIONAL IN ITS NATURAL FORM -- THERE BY ALLOWING ME TO USE -- A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STYLES LOCKS IS I WEAR MY HAIR BRAIDS OR TWIST FILLED RACE COMES IN IN TERMS OF THAT. NATURAL HAIR TEXTURE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF TRADES HISTORICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH RACE -- BEYOND. THE HAIR TEXTURE AND PROTECTED HER CELL THAT YOU CAN -- SURE -- ACTUALLY GO THERE PLENTY OF CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH REYES -- FOR EXAMPLE NOT ONLY HERE TEXTURE BUT HERE AND HERE STYLES BUT EVEN TODAY OUR NAMES ARE SO SEAT WITH RACE -- ALSO OUR SKIN COLOR IS ASSOCIATE IT WITH RACE ARE NO SHAPE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RACE ART THE SIZE OF OUR CHEEKS ARE THE POINT NOUS OF OUR NOSE OUR LIVES OUR EYES -- WE CAN GO ON IN TERMS OF A CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH RACE AS WELL AS CONTEMPORARILY ASSOCIATED WITH RACE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SING NOW WE HAVE A MOTION SENATOR MITCH WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I'D LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE -- THE ENQUIRING YOU ALL ALLOWING US TO HAVE THIS A VERY -- DELICATE AND POLITICAL ISSUE YOU KNOW BLACK PEOPLE WE'VE USED OUR HAIR OUR NATURAL HAIR -- IT'S BEEN USED -- TO EMPOWER US AND HAS BEEN USED AGAINST US. MANY VIEW US WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER -- THE BLACK POWER MOVEMENT -- AND WHEN WE'RE IN OUR HERE NATURAL IT AND AFRO OLDS REALLY REFLECTED A SINCE OF CULTURAL PRIDE -- AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN MODERN TIMES WE'RE IN OUR HERE IN ITS NATURAL STATE OUGHT IN LOCKS IN TWIST IN BRAIDS -- IS ONCE AGAIN BOTH A POLITICAL AND A PERSONAL STATEMENT A PERSONAL STATEMENT THAT I CHOSE FOR MYSELF WHEN I TURNED -- FORTY ANY PERSONAL TASTE A STATEMENT THAT I CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN EVEN AFTER I ENTERED THE PUBLIC. DOMAIN AS A CANDIDATE FOR PUBLIC OFFICE AGAIN AS I SAY I I YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER OF CALLS AND LETTERS I RECEIVED FROM PARENTS EVEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO. OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TEASED AND TAUNTED ABOUT -- THEIR CHOICE TO WEAR THEIR HAIR IN ITS NATURAL KNOCKED NATURAL FORM. I THINK THIS BILL WHICH WILL -- SET A PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT NATIONWIDE IS CERTAINLY TIMELY AND INCREASING ANOTHER-OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO EDUCATE EACH OTHER ABOUT CULTURAL -- CHOICES THAT WE ALL MAKE I'M PROUD TO WEAR MY LOCKS -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. SOME PEOPLE MAY ASSUME WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE SOME SMALL ALTERATION TO GET A JOB WHY WOULDN'T YOU -- TO LOCK WHEN THIS HAIR IS A TIMELY PROCESS IT IS A PERMANENT PROCESS -- TO NO LONGER HAVE LOCKS ALL HAVE TO CUT THEM OFF AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED. BASED ON THE FACTS AND WE CERTAINLY HOPE ARE IN A POSITION -- AS A SOCIETY TO FULLY EMBRACE THE COMPLEXITIES AND DIVERSITIES OF ALL PEOPLE WHO CONSTITUTE OF THE WORKPLACE AND WOULD ACCEPT MY PERSONAL CHOICE OF HOW TO WEAR MY HERE -- AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CONSTITUTES PROFESSIONAL MISSILE IN THE WORKPLACE AS THE STANDARD THAT SHOULD BE MET AND SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOU TO SUPPORT SB.

AND WITH THAT IF I COULD GET EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION HERE. WE GET A LITTLE QUIET IN THE ROOM. GIVE YOU JUST A MOMENT ALL RIGHT. SENATOR HILL THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I I COULD ONLY HOPE FOR A THE OPPORTUNITY -- AT SOME POINT -- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND AND COLLEAGUES SB. TWO TWENTY THREE WILL HELP STUDENTS WITH SEVERE MEDICAL DISABILITIES ATTEND SCHOOL OFTEN THE ONLY MEDICATION THE WORK FOR SOME OF THE STUDENTS IS MEDICAL CANNABIS. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW A PARENT OR GUARDIAN GUARDIAN TO COME ON CAMPUS TODAY IT MINISTER OF MEDICAL CANNABIS. TO THEM IN NON SMOKING AND NON VAPING FORMS MANY OF THE STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE IT THOSE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS AT REGULAR INTERVALS WHICH WILL OFTEN. OCCURS DURING SCHOOL HOURS CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS. THESE STUDENTS MUST BE PICKED UP BY THEIR PARENTS SIGNED OUT AND TAKEN OFF CAMPUS IN ORDER TO TAKE THOSE THEIR MEDICATIONS AND THE LAW REQUIRES ONE THOUSAND FEET FROM THE CAMPUS. THIS IS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR LEARNING. SB TWO TWENTY THREE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNING BOARD OF A K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION OR CHARTER SCHOOL TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT THIS POLICY IT IS NOT A STATE MANDATE. DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES AT OPT IN CAN OPT OUT FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS PUT AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THIS POLICY. SB TWO TWENTY THREE REQUIRES THE STUDENT TO BE A QUALIFIED MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT WITH A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION. TYPICALLY THE MEDICINE IS ADMINISTERED AS OIL CAPSULES INSURERS LIQUIDS OR TOPICAL CREAMS. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT A PARENT MUST NOT DISRUPT THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND MUST TAKE ALL CANNABIS FROM SCHOOL. FROM SCHOOL GROUNDS AFTER ADMINISTRATION EXISTING LAW ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO LEGALLY ADMINISTER ANY PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG INCLUDING OPIATES. THAT A CHILD HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED. BUT THERE ARE MEDICAL CONDITIONS PHARMACEUTICALS CAN'T FIX AND AS WE KNOW THEY OFTEN HAVE DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS. MEDICAL CANNABIS HELPS FILL SOME OF THESE GAPS IN LESSEN THE THESE CHALLENGING SIDE EFFECTS. PAIRS ACROSS THE NATION HAVE ACCESS TREATING THEIR CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL CANNABIS WHEN NO PHARMACEUTICAL WOULD WORK WASHINGTON COLORADO FLORIDA MAINE AND NEW JERSEY HAVE ALL PASSED. LEGISLATION ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. MUCH OF THE TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR IN COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KRENA MCCAIN I'M HERE TO SUPPORT JUDGES ACT SB. TWO TO THREE MY SAN GIOVANNI JOE JOE HE MENACE HAS USE CANNABIS INTO INSURANCE CBT AND TEACH THE FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. SINCE THE AGE OF THREE MONTHS OLD HE HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH EPILEPSY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LENNIX BECAUSE SO SYNDROME. THIS IS A VERY RARE AND HARD TO CONTROL EPILEPSY. JO JO WAS MEDICATED WITH HIGH DOSES OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND ALSO FITTED WITH A DEVICE CALLED THE VAGUS NERVE STIMULATOR ALL WITH NO SUCCESS. I WAS WATCHING MY SENDAI RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE A BETTER WAY. I BEGAN RESEARCHING CANNABIS AND THE EFFECTS. OF IT TO TREAT EPILEPSY AND CHOSE TO TRY IT AS OUR LAST RESORT. WE HAD TO GET A WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM OUR NEUROLOGISTS PRIOR TO SEEKING A MEDICAL MARIJUANA RECOMMENDATION. WE HAD TO FIND A DOCTOR THAT TREATED MINERS BECAUSE NOT ALL DO. FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS THE FIRST TIME WE TRIED CANNABIS SENATE SEEM VERY HOPEFUL DAY BY DAY I SEEN HIM EMERGE FROM IS MEDICATED STATE AND START ENGAGING AGAIN. FEATURES WERE DECREASED IMMEDIATELY. I SUPPORT THIS BILL DUE TO JO JO NEEDING A DOSE AT SCHOOL TWELVE PM DAILY. I FEEL CANNABIS SHOULD BE TREATED AS EVERY OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ON CAMPUS. IT IS NOT FAIR THAT THIS MEDICINE AND SAVE MY SON'S LIFE AND NOT BE GIVEN THE SAME TREATMENT AND ABILITY. AS OTHER PHARMACEUTICALS ON CAMPUS I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS BILL BECOMING LAW. MY SON'S LIFE AND SO MANY OTHERS DEPEND ON IT. IN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS NO ONE HAS DIED FROM CANNABIS USE IT IS THE ONLY MEDICINE. THAT CAN TREAT SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS ON SUCH A WIDE SPECTRUM FROM APPLE APPS THE TO ARTHRITIS THE CANCER TO PARKINSON'S. IT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REGENERATE BRAIN CELLS THIS I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND. I ASK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART TO GIVE A YES VOTE TODAY AND BE THE VOICE MY SON AND SO MANY OTHERS NEED. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY IS MARCH TWENTY SIXTH IT'S EPILEPSY AWARENESS DAY. AND IT'S AMAZING TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO GET THIS PASSED TODAY. AND I WANT TO PUT ALL CONCERNS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS -- ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO OBTAIN. ONE AND THE USE OF CANNABIS ON CAMPUS BEING PUT IN THE WRONG HANDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I THINK WE ARE I RECALL YOU WERE HERE LAST YEAR'S YES THANK YOU IT WAS YOUR TENACITY. SHARE YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES IF YOU COULD LEAVE IT -- KEEP IT AT THAT GREAT YES A GOOD MOM GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS AND HAPPY AT APPLE OF SEE WHERE TO STAY. MY NAME IS JENNIFER COOLIDGE I WAS ALSO HERE LAST YEAR TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY SON ZACHARY -- I AM HIS MOM AND I'M ALSO IN INTENSIVE CARE NURSE AND A SELFIE HOSPITAL LEVEL TWO TRAUMA CENTER -- I SPOKE BEFORE YOU LAST YEAR ABOUT ZACHARY -- HIS SEIZURES HAD PROGRESSED TO THE POINT WHERE HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO SET UP ON HISOWN. WE WERE GIVEN HOSPICE PAPERWORK AND SENT HOME AFTER ALL TREATMENT HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED. A MY HUSBAND PROPOSED TRYING CANNABIS AND TO SAY I WAS AGAINST IT WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT -- HOWEVER WITH HOSTAGE PAPERWORK IN HAND I WAS WILLING TO GIVE IT A TRY -- WE ATTEMPTED TO CALL OVER TWENTY DOCTORS IN THE GREATER BAY AREA AND VISIT A HANDFUL. ARE ALL THE SAME TOLD ALL OF THEM TOLD US THE SAME THING NOBODY WOULD WRITE A RECOMMENDATION FOR A FIFTEEN MONTH OLD CHILD. AFTER A MONTH OF EXHAUSTIVE SEARCHING OUR PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST AGREED TO SIGN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH FORM. NINE ZERO FOUR FOUR STATING THAT DOCKERY'S CONDITION WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE CANNABIS. IT WAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE ESSENTIAL DOCKERY CARE TEAM BE ON BOARD WITH THIS TREATMENT OPTION. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OPEN AND HONEST WITH HIS PROVIDERS IN HOW WE ARE T&lt;c.cyan&gt; TREATING.&lt;/c&gt; AND WHEN WE HAD TO CHANGE INSURANCE TWO YEARS AGO WE HAD TO FIND A WHOLE NEW CARE TEAM. OR REQUIRED TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION REGARDING HIS CONDITION AND NEED FOR CANNABIS USE. BECAUSE OF THE STIPULATIONS PLACED ON CHILDREN NOW ZACHARY HAS TO LOSE THIRTY MINUTES EVERY DAY TO GET HIS MEDICATIONS. SO FAR THIS YEAR HE HAS LOST THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MINUTES OF EDUCATIONAL TIME TO RECEIVE HIS MEDICATIONS. THAT'S 10% OF HIS LEARNING TIME IN THE CLASSROOM. ON BEHALF OF THAT GREEN ALL CHILDREN WHO REQUIRE CANNABIS TO CONTROL SEIZURES AND OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE TO LOT OF TIME ON THE SCHOOL TO GET CANNABIS AND MOST OF THIS IS DONE IN SOME KIND OF OF LIQUID FORM OR HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO EVEN. BE DOING THIS BUT ANYWAY ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU TO STEP FORWARD. ERICA HOFFMAN I'M HAVE THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION AND ON BEHALF OF THE NEED FOR ALL STUDENTS.

THANK YOU ANY FRANCO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THE LARGEST A TRADE ASSOCIATION THE STATE REPRESENTED THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THAT'S WILL KEVIN LINDSAY -- WOULD SERVICES SCHOOL DISTRICT. ABOVE REALLY -- SUPPORTERS BILL. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MATT HI CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DON'T HAVE ANY NOTED. OUR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I REMEMBER THIS BILL LAST YEAR. CANNABIS IS NOW LEGAL IN THE UNITED IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WERE LEGAL EVERYWHERE MIGHT MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER TO BE DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT CERTAINLY [inaudible] OF THE FACT THAT IT'S NOW LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS NOT THE BOOGIE MAN. WHICH IS KIND OF SHOCKING THAT WE LOOK AT IT IN THAT WAY ESPECIALLY FOR OUR YOUNGSTERS FOR WHOM THIS HAS BEEN. OF ALMOST A MIRACLE DRUG IT SOUNDS LIKE SO -- I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE DID HEAR THIS THOROUGHLY LAST YEAR -- AND THEN I'LL ASK A CENTER MONNING TO GO GO FOR WITH HIS QUESTIONS -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE FDA APPROVED A DRUG DERIVED FROM CANNABIS FOR THE TREATMENT OF TO SEVERE FORMS OF EPILEPSY AFTER LAST YEAR'S BILL PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I'M WONDERING. IF THAT MEDICATION IS NOW AVAILABLE TO CHILDREN. IS IT IS IT IS IT IS IT'S IN A SYNTHETIC FORM IT'S NOT. OF THE LAND LIKE THE TEACHERS THAT WE PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN WITH -- WITH SYNTHETIC FORM COME SIDE EFFECTS. AND THEY I'LL YOU KNOW THE RISK IS JUST TOO HIGH. I BELIEVE MY PERSONAL OPINION I WOULD NOT USE THT MEDICINE FOR MY CHILD. ALL RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE AGAIN. THE C. B. D. IN THE OILS AND THE CREAMS ARE JUST NOT. GOING TO HURT ANYBODY. THEY JUST DON'T PENALIZE YOU CAN'T YOU DON'T INHALE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE DOWN WIND AND WORRY ABOUT GETTING A HI THIS IS IT'S LIKE. THE BILL INCLUDING ON NEOSPORIN HER SOMETHING I JUST -- IT IT IT IS KIND OF A SHOCKING BUT LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS -- WHAT OTHER ILLNESSES OR OR ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT -- DOCTORS RECOMMENDED A CHILDREN BE TREATED WITH MEDICAL CANNABIS ARE THERE OTHERS A COULD YOU KIND OF GIVE US AN IDEA BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN WITH EPILEPSY IN SCHOOL THOSE OF MEDICATION IT'S PROBABLY VERY HELPFUL. IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES SO IF YOU COULD ENLIGHTEN US A LITTLE BIT ON THAT THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. UP WILL LIKE CANCER DEFINITELY THE SIDE EFFECTS AND THE DEBILITATING THINGS THAT IT BRINGS -- MIGRAINES ARTHRITIS THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS CROHN'S DISEASE -- IT IS AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY TYPE OF MEDICATION. SO ANYTHING LIKE MS THAT'S ANOTHER -- DEBILITATING DISEASE THAT CVD HAS PROVEN TO PROVIDE SUCH EXTREME BENEFITS FOR AND BE ABLE TO HAVE MINIMAL PHARMACEUTICAL. BECAUSE THAT SIDE FEEL THAT WHEN YOU BRING IN SUCH LARGE DOSES OF PHARMACEUTICALS. YOU GET TEN OTHER PROBLEMS ALL THE SIDE EFFECTS. SO -- THAT'S THE GREAT PART ABOUT CVD IN THC IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ACCOMPANYING THE MEDICATION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] CENTER MONNING. YOU MADAM CHAIR IN WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BACK IN THE WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND INTERESTINGLY AS YOU POINTED OUT ON NATIONAL EPILEPSY YEAH. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE THE ANSWER T THIS BUT I A KIND OF ALONG THE LINES OF THE CHAIR ASKING SOME OF THE OTHER CONDITIONS THAT HAVE. BEEN PROVEN TO BENEFIT. DO WE HAVE AN IDEA OF ESTIMATE IN CALIFORNIA HOW MANY STUDENTS HOW MANY FAMILIES. ARE BEING. ADVERSELY IMPACTED RIGHT NOW IN OTHER WORDS HAVING TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL GROUNDS -- WELL IN MY A PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE A LOT OF PARENTS ARE DOES SING AROUND SCHOOL SO THEY'RE NOT EVEN GOING THE CAMPUS AND PULLING THEIR CHILDREN NOW. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT IT'S A DELAYED RESPONSE TO THE MEDICATION YOU'RE NOT GETTING FULL BENEFITS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ON THE PROPER REGIMENT. SO PARENTS ARE CHOOSING TO SEE DOES THEIR CHILDREN BEFORE THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND THEN AS SOON AS THEY GET HOME. WHICH COULD BE SIXTY EIGHT TO pDOSING THEM AGAIN AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT YOU'RE CHASING YOU'RE NOT. RATING THE MEDICAL SUBSTANCE THAT YOU NEED TO WITH WITH STAND IN YOUR BODY. IT DEPLETES MATTER SING THAT'S TRUE WITH. SO CALLED REGULAR FIRM SETTING VIA EXACTLY -- IT BUT ANY IDEA OF HOW MANY FAMILIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL I KNOW A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT I'M HERE REPRESENTING AND FIGHTING FOR TODAY. THAT ARE IN MY PEDIATRIC CANNABIS GROUPS AND EPILEPSY GROUPS. NO WELL I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER. THE MONEY I'D I DON'T KNOW AND AND WE SHOULD LIKE TO ANSWER BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A CLEAR NUMBER BECAUSE MOST PARENTS ARE. KIND OF RELUCTANT TO TO BRING THAT TO SCHOOL OR TO THANK ABOUT THIS -- BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE AROUND. AND AS I UNDERSTAND. SENATOR YOUR BILL WOULD MAKE THIS A VOLUNTARY BY SCHOOL DISTRICT IT IS IT'S IT'S VOLUNTARY BY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND IT'S AN OPT IN PROGRAM FOUR OF THE FIVE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE PASSED THIS HAVE IT MADE IT MADE IT MANDATORY IN THE STATE SO IT'S AT AN OPT OUT. BRIAN AND FOR IMPORTANT FIRST STEP BUT I YES JUST FOR WHATEVER REASONS IF THERE'S A PATCHWORK SOME FAMILIES -- WOULDN'T BE SERVED BY. BY THIS GREATER ACTIVITY -- BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING IT FORWARD I'D BE GLAD TO MOVE THE BILL THE APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU WE DO A FEW MORE QUESTIONS SENATOR ALLEN FALL BY SENATOR STERN. BY WHEN IT FIRST THANK THE AUTHOR FOR FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION MEMBER THIS BILL CAME TO EDUCATION COMMITTEE LAST YEAR AND AND YOU KNOW I THINK THERE WERE THERE ANY OTHER SOME FEDERALISM IN THERE SOME ISSUES WHERE THE SCHOOL I'M DISTRICTS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT -- THIS IS STILL ILLEGAL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN THERE SOME CHALLENGES THERE -- BUT THIS DOES REQUIRE THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD HAS THAT KIND OF EXAMINE THIS DISCUSS IN PUBLIC AND THERE CAN BE AN OPEN MEETING. AND AND DECISION THAT'S MADE LOCALLY AND ITS LOCAL ACCOUNTABLE WHAT I IT WAS UNCLEAR ABOUT I WAS READING -- THE GOVERNOR'S VETO SO THAT IT SAYS THAT THE GOVERNOR OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW THE GOVERNOR VETOED. THE BILL IN A PRESIDENTE CALLED WHAT YOU PROPOSED. AND HE SAYS. THIS BILL IS OVERLY BROAD AS IT APPLIES TO ALL STUDENTS INSTEAD OF LIMITED CASES WHERE DOCTOR RECOMMENDS MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR STUDENT ORDER. TO PREVENT. OR REDUCE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF A SEIZURE -- BUT IT IS NOT ALL STUDENTS ARE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHILD YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MEDICAL CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION ON FILE. FOR IT TO BE. EVEN BY THE DIRECTION -- INTO A THINK WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO IS IT APPLIES TO ALL STUDENTS THAT HAVE MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PHYSICIANS SO IT WOULD BE. EXPANDING THE USE I I I BELIEVE HE WAS MORE INTERESTED IN FOCUSING ON EPILEPSY HAS A PARTICULAR AILMENT BUT WHAT HE WAS DOING IN THAT. YOU KNOW MESSAGES HE'S ACTUALLY IS STATING SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE BECAUSE IF YOU. ARE ONLY GETTING MEDICAL CANNABIS IN THE SCHOOL THAN YOU HAVE. IDENTIFIED A PARTICULAR AILMENT WTH THAT PARTICULAR STUDENT AS HAVING THAT EPILEPSY WHICH IS IN VIOLATION OF HIP -- IF THAT BECOMES A PART OF THE THE RECORD OR THE SCHOOL IS USING THAT INFORMATION SO I THINK HAT WAS KIND OF A WRONG DIRECTION. TO TO BE GOING AND NOT PARTICULARLY A LEGAL ONE AT THAT. WITH THAT IT THAT HAS BEEN THAT THE PRIVACY ISSUES THE HIP ISSUES ARE STILL SOMETHING I KNOW THAT WE WORKED ON LAST YEAR ON THIS AND AGAIN -- INTO ASTONISHING TO ME THAT WE TALK TALK TALK ABOUT THIS IS SOME. KIND OF ARCANE MEDICAL. CREATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A PRODUCT THAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE USE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE USES FOR ARTHRITIS. I HAVE YET TO SEE THEM. RUN AROUND ON THE CEILINGS AND BE KIND OF CRAZY. HI THAT'S A DIFFERENT A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE I SUSPECT BUT CERTAINLY THE THE THE MEDICAL PART OF THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT AND SO -- I THINK THAT THEY'RE APPLES AND ORANGES BUT WE BUT THIS IS AN ATTEMPT NOW AND WORKING WITH THE SCHOOLS AND AGAIN I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. REALLY WILLING TO COME. A STEP UP ON THIS THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT A YOU KNOW A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION THIS IS ACTUALLY LIFESAVING AND AND THE WAY WE DEALT WITH CANNABIS OF THE PAST MANY YEARS HAS JUST BEEN SO WRONG HEADED CERTAINLY CANNABIS OF THIS NATURE SO AND C. B. D. -- SO. I THINK AGAIN THERE ARE THE MEDICAL ISSUES SOCIAL GET I THINK THEY CAN GET WORKED OUT AS WE GO FORWARD BUT THIS FOCUS RIGHT HERE IS ON JUST MAKING IT AVAILABLE. SO CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO LOSE ALL THESE HOURS OF SCHOOL IF THEY IF THIS IS YOU KNOW IF THIS CANNABIS RECIBE DEAR WHATEVER THAT. THE PRODUCT IS IS ABLE TO HELP THESE CHILDREN LEAD NORMAL LIVES. US SENATOR STERN. ALL RIGHT THIS GUEST CENTER BORDERS. WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IF I IF I WOULD IF I WAS SICK -- MY MY MOTHER WOULD BRING. THE ANTIBIOTICS TO SCHOOL AND THE NURSE -- WOULD FOLLOW THE THE REGIMEN AND I'D BE CALLED IN. AND WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE SCHOOL NURSE -- WHY ISN'T THAT AN OPTION IN SOMETHING WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS? IT'S A OR IS THAT UNDER THE GUARDIAN IS TO GIVE THAT UNDER GUARDIAN. NO IT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE HERE MAINLY THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND SCHOOL FACULTY WE'RE VERY CONCERNED. THAT THEY WOULD BE ADMINISTRATION WHAT WOULD BE A CAN CONSIDERED A FEDERALLY -- ILLEGAL PRODUCT AND THAT ALSO COULD CALL INTO QUESTION PERHAPS THE THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT COME TO THOSE SCHOOLS IF THERE WERE THAT WERE EVER QUESTION SO. THE EVEN THOUGH THEY DO THAT WITH OPIOID TO DO WITH ANTIBIOTICS AND THEY ADMINISTER THEM TO THE STUDENTS -- BECAUSE OF THE THE SENSITIVE NATURE OF OF CANNABIS -- THE WERE RELUCTANT AND ALSO I BELIEVE BECAUSE THERE ARE EVEN THOUGH THIS IS AS THE C. B. D. IS THE C. B. D. PART. THERE IS ALWAYS A TRACE AMOUNT A GENERALLY OF THC WITHIN THAT PRODUCT. NOT ENOUGH TO CREATE THE PSYCHOACTIVE OF FACT BUT THERE IS SOME WE IN THAT AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE THE SCHOOLS WANTED TO HAVE THAT. ON THEIR CAMPUS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE EVEN THOUGH THE OPIOIDS OF EVERY LEVEL ARE THERE BUT IT'S I THINK THERE'S A SENSITIVITY THERE AND WE WANTED TO RESPECT THAT. OUR AND LAST QUESTION. THIS IS WHERE I HAVE A TOUGH TIME. AND IT'S NOT. ANYTHING THAT CAN BE RESOLVED TODAY IS THE IDEA OF A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION VERSES A PRESCRIPTION -- I HAVE A TOUGH TIME WITH THAT IF IF IT'S IF FOR MAKING LEAPS AND BOUNDS AS WE ARE AS A STATE IN THIS DIRECTION. DESPITE THE THE FEDERAL -- PLEASE THE MIME SO OFFBEAT BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN MOVE ON TO A MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTOR WHO TREATS MINORS YOU HAVE TO GET. THE CONSENT OF YOUR PEDIATRICIAN OR NEUROLOGISTS OR THE COVERING DOCTOR. PHIL -- NOT TO SAY THAT THEY CAN'T WRITE THE RECOMMENDATION AS WELL SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS THE PRESCRIPTION. SO YOU YOU CAN'T GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR CANNABIS JOCASTA YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND LET ALONE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL -- ANYONE. CAN GET A RECOMMENDATION. NOT WHEN IT COMES TO MINORS EXACTLY NOW WHEN IT COMES TO MINORS SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN OF THE OPINION THAT BEFORE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION THEN. THE DOCTOR SHOULD BE IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO STAND BEHIND. THEIR THEIR ADDRESS MEN ON OR DIAGNOSIS OF A GIVEN ISSUE AND FOLLOW THROUGH ONE AS OPPOSED TO RECOMMENDATION THAT'S A SIDE ISSUE. BUT IT IS THE PHYSICIAN IT IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR THAT MAKES THE RECOMMENDATION. YES -- ONE HUNDRED OUT OF ONE HUNDRED REQUESTED MY NECK OF THE WOODS NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN DENIED -- RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEN WE SHOULD BE HAVING TO THE CANNOT. CHATTER IF YOU'RE USING TINCTURE OF CVD OR SOMETHING IT IS. THERE IS NO -- PSYCHEDELIC BENEFIT YEAH THAT THIS IS JUST LIKE PUTTING A HAND CREAM ON YOUR HANDS OR TAKING USING A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR OF FRANKLY HOW ANTIQUATED. AND HOW THE THE NEANDERTHAL WE ARE WHEN IT COMES. TO DEALING WITH THE SUBSTANCE BUT IT IS CERTAINLY THEORETICALLY A DOCTOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE IT RATHER THAN RECOMMENDED BUT UNTIL WE GET SOME. SOME. THE INSIDE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE KIND OF JUST TO RETURNING OURSELVES INTO A PRETZEL TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE AS AS IT SHOULD BE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. BUT BUT APPRECIATE THAT THE OTHER COMMON IF I MIGHT. IS ARE AS FAR AS SCHOOL NURSES UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A LOT OF SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE NURSES SO. THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU AND I WERE IN SCHOOL ARM I SHOULD SAY I WAS IN SCHOOL LONG BEFORE YOU. EVERY SCHOOL DID HAVE A NURSE. BUT THEY DON'T TODAY SENATOR STERN -- I WAS GONNA SAY ANYTHING BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR FOR THE RECORD THIS IS NOT ONLY C. B. D. THIS IS ALSO THE INGESTION OF THC THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED HERE SO IT'S NOT JUST -- TOPICAL TINCTURES OUR BOMBS YOU ACTUALLY THERE STILL IS THE PSYCHOTROPIC EFFECTS IN THE THC EVEN IF MINOR OR SOME SMALL NOW WE KNOW IT'S USEFUL AS AN ACTIVATION AGENT. WHEN CMBINED WITH THE C. B. D. IS WHICH IS WHY THEY LEAVE IT IN THERE BT? THERE STILL IS IN INJECT SOME SOME AMOUNT OF TEACH SEATED HELLO JOE OR YOUR SON. IN JAIL RIGHT. AND SO SO ON THAT THE YOU MENTION THE PUBLIC HEALTH FORM NINETY FORTY FOUR I BELIEVE IS WHAT IT IS. I WOULD ACT THIS WAY -- LOW BLOW THERE'S A PROTOCOL HELLO SURE HANDED TO THE SERGEANTS SERGEANT. AND SO THE ANSWER TO THIS IS WHAT PRECEDES THE MEDICAL RECOMMENDATION THIS IS THE TRIGGER. TO OR IS THIS IS THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATION. AT THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO DISASTROUS PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST -- AT KAISER FIND THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT A PHONE NUMBER ON THERE AND EVERYTHING AND THEN I CAN MAIL THAT INTO THE STATE TO GET HIM A CANNABIS CARD. THAT WE COULD THEN GO TO DISPENSARIES. TO GET MEDICATION FOR HIM BUT I WENT TO LIKE. MULTIPLE DOCTORS WE CALLED TWENTY WE WENT TO MULTIPLE DOCTORS NOBODY WOULD SIGN THAT FORM FOR US. BECAUSE ACREE WAS SIXTEEN MONTHS OLD FIFTEEN MONTHS OLD AT THE TIME SO. THE PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST WE RECEIVE THE TIME SIGN THAT FORM IN OUR CURRENT PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST THAT WE SWITCH TO SIGN THAT FORM. SO THEY CAN BE ON CAMPUS. FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES AT HIS SCHOOL. ALONG WITH CONSENT OF THAT DOCTORS SAYING THIS CHILD OR YOUNG ADULT NEEDS THIS TYPE OF MEDICATION -- THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS NOW THAT -- CANNABIS IS RECREATIONALLY LEGAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- THERE'S NOT SO MANY A MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTORS HANDING OUT RECOMMENDATIONS ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S LEGAL. SO THERE. IT LEVY IT DOES LEAVE THE FUEL -- MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTORS THAT ARE TREATING AND A VERY SMALLER AMOUNT THAT TREAT MINOR. SO YOU -- THE DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER YEAH JUST JUST THIS PROFESSION IS IT IS THERE ANY WAY TO TO THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE WHERE BECAUSE I SEE IT'S IT AND IT'S A RELATIVELY EXPANSIVE LIST WHICH IS MAYBE WHERE THE LAST GOVERNOR'S CONCERN CAME IN AROUND NAUSEA. OR ANY OTHER CHRONIC MEDICAL SYMPTOM THAT SUBSTANTIAL LIMITS THE PERSON'S ABILITY CONDUCT MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES OR CHRONIC PAIN SO STARTED TO DEAL WITH THESE [inaudible] INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUES WITHOUT. GETTING INTO THE HIPAA VIOLATION BUT IS THERE IS THERE ANY WAY TO SORT OF THREAD THAT NEEDLE TO FIND A WAY. TO SORT A NARROWLY ADDRESS THE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE BUT NOT SORT OF HAVE THAT BACK DOOR IF THERE WAS ABUSING THE SYSTEM AT ALL FOR IN TERMS OF YOU NAUSEA RELATED OR THINGS THAT SORT OF MIGHT BE. NOT TO SEE YOU KNOW PARENTS ARE GOING TO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY PROBABLY TOO YOU KNOW FALSE GET OF SOME FALSE PRESCRIPTION FOR OF YOU KNOW. FAKE NAUSEA OR WHATEVER BUT IS THERE SOME WAITED TO TO THE THREAD THAT NEED WITHOUT VIOLATING SOME OF THE HIT HIP A CONCERN I DON'T KNOW REYES YOU WOULD DO THAT I DON'T I DON'T. KNOW HOW YOU COULD MAKE THAT JUDGMENT I MEAN THAT'S WHY WE INTEREST. THOSE DECISIONS TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. TO TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND AS WE HAVE THE NEUROLOGISTS TO ME THAT NOT A MEDICAL BOTTOM AMID THIS ANOTHER MARIJUANA DR. BUT A REGULAR PEDIATRICIAN OR NEUROLOGISTS TO PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST WHO HAS TO MAKE THAT DECISION THIS IS A COLLECTIVE. THIS IS BASICALLY A TREATMENT FOR A CONDITION THAT HAS BEEN MEDICALLY IDENTIFIED SO -- AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION SENATOR PER. YEAH SENATOR BURGESS -- OF I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WAS IT ABOUT EDIBLES. IS SO NONE OF THESE ARE WHAT WE WOULD CALL EDIBLES ARE THEY WILL BUILD A TEAM SURE IT'S AN OIL FOR MANY GOES IN YOUR MOUTH SO-TECHNICALLY YOU CAN CALL IT AN EDIBLE BUT IT'S NOT A BAKED ITEM OR COOKIE OR A GUN NEEDS. ITS OIL IT LOOKS JUST LIKE OLIVE OIL LIGHT AND GOES INTO THE MOUTH AND IT'S INGESTED THAT WAY AND TOP OF HOLES ARE EITHER IN A CREAM OR LIKE A BOMB TYPE OF AGENT -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS REVERSED AND IS JUST MEDICAL CANNABIS. WITH OUR MEDICINAL CANNABIS WOULD BE MAY BE HELPFUL TO ARTICULATE. AND REFINED THAT DOWN CAUSE MEDICINAL IS. WHATEVER WE DEEM IT TO BE IN SOME INSTANCES -- MY RESPONSE TO YOU IT IN ORDER IT I KNOW ON THE PAPER IT SEEMS CRIED LIKE HELD ON HOLD. ONE QUESTION AT A TIME. WHEN INSERTED OKAY? YOUR QUESTION WAS STILL OUTSTANDING WHICH WAS. WHAT IS WE'VE NOW MOVED ON TO ANOTHER QUESTION? FEEL THE BROAD SPECTRUM ON THE FORM IN ORDER TO EVEN PROCEED FORWARD YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SEVERE ENOUGH CONDITION FOR THAT ARE ALL EDGES OR THAT PEDIATRICIAN TO SAY. OKAY YOU NEED THIS YEAR JUST NOT NAUSEOUS FOR THE DAY ARE HAVING SOME GASTRIC ISSUES LIKE YOUR NEED IS SO SEVERE AND OUR PHARMACEUTICALS ARE ADDING TO THE PROBLEM THEY'RE NOT HELPING THE PROBLEM. THEREFORE I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOU TO GO SEEK MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTOR THAT TREATS MINERS AND GET THE MEDICATION THAT YOU NEED. AND THEN YOU CAN COME BACK AND WE CAN WORK A DOSES OR THE AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE TAKING AND AND FOLLOW BECAUSE MY PEDIATRICIAN AND RELIGIOUS FOLLOW ME AS WELL. IT'S NOT JUST THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTOR THAT PRESCRIBED -- THE RECOMMENDATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT IT'S A QUICK ANSWER TO THE QUESTION DO WE GET AN ANSWER SOME OF THESE ARE TINCTURES ARGUABLY COULD SAY THEY'RE EDIBLE BECAUSE IT'S A TINCTURE THAT YOU PUT ON THE MILD. THESE ARE ALL PRESCRIBED ARE THEY NOT YES THROUGH THIS RECOMMENDATION WE CAN'T CALL IT A PRESCRIPTION BECAUSE THE FEDS HAVE WOKEN UP YET. BUT IT IS STATE THEY ARE. ESSENTIALLY THIS IS A MEDICINE. IT JUST HAPPENS TO INCLUDE CANNABIS THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE THC TO ACTIVATE IT. NOTHING THAT WOULD GET YOU HIGH BUT A MEDICAL OF THE TREATMENT THAT ASSIST IN THE CARE OF THESE ILLNESSES ALL RIGHT SO WITH THAT. WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION I BELIEVE. AND OF THE MOTION IS. DUEPASSED TO THE SENATE FLOOR HEY. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON BY ACCIDENT I FORGES. ORDERS NO ALAN. ALLEN I GOT A HERO. CABALLERO AYE MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN. STERN I AM BURKE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK AND ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU TAKE UP. A I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SB. TWO TWO FIVE THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL QUALIFIED CALIFORNIANS. REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS MAY SERVE ON CALIFORNIA'S AND LOCALS STATE OF STATE AND LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS -- SB TWO TWO FIVE REMOVES A VERY OBSOLETE CODE SECTION WRITTEN. TO EXCLUDE IMMIGRANTS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE CIVIC LIFE IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES. ALMOST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO SO AS B. TWO TWO FIVE REMOVES AN OBSOLETE CODE SECTION. WRITTEN -- TO EXCLUDE IMMIGRANTS -- IT IS NOT GOING TO CIRCUMVENT FEDERAL AUTHORITY TO EMPLOY OR NOT EMPLOYEE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT EMPLOYMENT. OUR INTENT IN SB TO DO FIVE IS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO SERVICE. AN AUTHORIZED ALL AUTHORIZED ALL QUALIFIED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO BE ABLE TO SERVE ON CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE -- STATE A LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE WANT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT TRULY REFLECT THE COMMUNITIES AND THE STATE AS A WHOLE -- THEY BETTER WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE THERE ARE NEIGHBORS ARE THE PARENTS OF THE KIDS THAT GO TO SCHOOL WITH OUR KIDS -- THE GO TO CHURCHES OR SYNAGOGUES WHEREVER WE GO THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS THEY ARE OUR FAMILIES THEY HAVE MANY TALENTS ON THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ON OUR BOARDS AND AND COMMISSIONS -- THEY HAVE DIVERSE EXPERIENCES ACADEMIC OF WHEN THEY HAVE ENTERTAINMENT SPORTS SCIENCES ARTS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT AS A LEGAL MATTER. THIS BILL WILL ALIGN THE STATE'S DEFINITION OF CITIZEN WITH THE DEFINITION FOUND IN THE CITIZENSHIP CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. PUTTING AN END TO OLD LANGUAGE MEANT TO DISCRIMINATE AT THAT TIME AGAINST CHINESE IMMIGRANTS SO WITH THAT. MADAM CHAIR WITH THAT SAID I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE -- AND THE TWO WITNESSES TODAY ARE OF THE ANA. WHO IS WITH THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND CHRIS TO RESIGN CHISHOLM POLICY ADVOCATE WITH ALSO WITH CHIRLA? GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ADRIANA AND I'M A POT PROUD DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS A PROUD SISTER FOR US CITIZEN AND A PROUD FIRST GENERATION DOCUMENTED UC DAVIS ALUMNI. WITH A BACHELORS OF SCIENCE IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT. WHO HAS A PRIVILEGE TO BE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY AND URGE TO SUPPORT SB? TWO TWENTY FIVE WITHIN ITS BORDERS CALIFORNIA HOLD BOTH DENSE URBAN AREAS AND INTENSE INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION HUGE STRETCH STRETCHES OF DRY PRAIRIE. AND WATER RICH MOUNTAINS. POLICY DECISIONS AND THESE AREAS HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE ONE NOT ONLY GROUPS. WHILE NOT THE ONLY GROUPS AFFECTED BY FACT BY THESE FACTORS ARE LESS ABLE TO RESIST ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS BECAUSE OF THEIR SYSTEMATIC ERASURE. AND MARGINAL STATUS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND OUR BUS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED WITHIN THE SOLDIER CENTRAL VALLEY AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. TODAY THERE IS LITTLE REPRESENTATION FOR SUCH A VULNERABLE POPULATION WITHIN BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ABOUT THE INTERSECTION OF IMMIGRATION AND ENVIRONMENT. THIS LACK OF ATTENTION SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF SB. TWO TWENTY FIVE TO ALLOW ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS TO SERVE ON STATE AND LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THEREFORE UNDERSTANDING POSITION MALADY AN INTERSECTION MALADY ALLOWANCES TO ACQUIRE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICES EXPERIENCED BY AND DOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION LIKE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME AND MY COMMUNITY OF TEN MILLION TO SAVE ON THESE ARE BORN BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT NEXT WITNESS CHRIS FOR SIGNS OF CHIRLA PRADA BE A SPONSOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION JUST BRIEFLY REMARKED THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL MEASURE FOR IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION. TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IS ABLE TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD -- PROPERLY AS A MAKE DECISIONS ARE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU PLEASE STEP FOR WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. BACK A KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANDRE RIVERA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. AND CALIFORNIA'S CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE WE DID NOTGET ANY WRITTEN OPPOSITION IS ARE ANY OPPOSITION HERE TODAY. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS OF THEIR ANY QUESTIONS. YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. CENTER BORDERS. THANK YOU A MESSAGES FOR A CLARIFICATION. SO I'M LOOKING AT SECTION GRAY BACK BILL. IT IS IDENTIFYING A PERSON. IN THE CHANGE OF LANGUAGE IS ELIGIBLE TO HOLD AN ELECTIVE CIVIL OFFICE. AND AN ELECTIVE CIVIL OFFICE IS CAN BE HELD. ELECTED OFFICE -- ARE THERE LIMITATIONS ON THAT. IT'S A SIMPLE OFFICE. IF AT THE TIME. OF THE PERSON IS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE. AND A CITIZEN. THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF THE STATE OR BRING. TO SO I GUESS MY MY QUESTION IS -- IF THIS. UNDER THIS CHANGE WOULD AN INDIVIDUAL BE ABLE TO LET'S SAY RUN FOR JUDGE. AND ENFORCE THE LAWS. WOULD THAT BE AN ELIGIBLE. PURSUIT OKAY. OUR THROUGH THE CHAIR. THESE ODD NO SO UNFORTUNATELY OFF FEDERAL LAW WHICH SUPERSEDED THERE BUT INDIVIDUAL I STILL HAVE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT TO BE A REGISTERED VOTER. ON IN ORDER TRUMP FOR ELECTED OFFICE. HOWEVER THEY WOULD THIS WOULD JUST ALLOW THEM TO SERVE ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS SO THAT THAT'S THE NEXUS SO AND IN ORDER FOR FEDERAL. THE NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPERSEDE FEDERAL AW AND IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE NOT NOT OF US THAT ARE WHO ARE DAHLE CITIZENSHIP. IN THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN FOR FEDERAL. OR FOR ANY OTHER TO POSITION. ANY ELECTED POSITION YEAH BUT THAT'S WHY IT IS THAT THAT'S WHY IT'S LIMITED TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS CORRECT. SO THIS WOULD BE MOST THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS OLD LIKE ADVISORY AND EVERYONE MOST THESE WERE TAUGHT TO BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR SPEAKER OF THE PRO TIME AND SOMETIMES INSURANCE COMMISSIONER OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [inaudible] OR LOCAL. AND SO ESSENTIALLY. UP PEOPLE CAN ONLY OF BE APPOINTED TO OFFICE THIRD THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE LAW ABOUT ELECTED OFFICES HAS JUST APPOINTED POSITION GOVERNOR APPOINT A JUDGE. WELL THE GOVERNOR CAN APPOINT JUDGES BUT THEY HAVE TO BE THEY HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS WHICH ARE NOT SUPERSEDED BY THIS BILL OF FINE ON MY END CORRECT. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WOULD STOP TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT TO BE A REGISTERED VOTER AND A CITIZENS UNITED STATES. TO BE AND AND THOSE CASES OF A JUDGESHIP PARK SAY THE GOVERNOR WANTED APPOINT A SUPERVISOR AT THE COUNTY LEVEL I STILL HAVE TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS SO YOU HAVE TO BE A U. S. NATIONAL. USS [inaudible] SENATOR MONNING. MADAM CHAIR WELL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THINK. AS DEFINED APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUE. THIS BILL DOES GO. TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THINGS THAT -- APPOINTED NOT ELECTED I WOULD POINT OUT FOR THE RECORD THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS DO ALLOW LEGAL RESIDENT. ALIENS TO SERVE ON SCHOOL BOARDS TO BE ELECTED TO SCHOOL BOARDS ON THE THEORY OF TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION PARENTS WHO ARE PLAYING TAXES THEIR KIDS ARE IN THE SCHOOL -- IN CHICAGO THEY CAN BE ELECTED TO THE SCHOOL BOARD LEGAL RESIDENT SO IT'S NOT ALL CLASSES OF IMMIGRANTS BUT AS THOSE WITH A GREEN CARD. SO SOME JURISDICTIONS I THINK IN TEXAS THERE'S SOME CITIES THAT OF DON THIS IS WELL. BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. BUT THE NOTION OF TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY. INVOLVING IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE WHO WERE LIVING IN OUR COMMUNITIES PAYING TAXES IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- TO HAVE THEM BE INVOLVED AND SHARE THEIR EXPERTISE THEIR PERSPECTIVES AND OPINIONS -- IS HOW YOU BUILD A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY I BELIEVE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND GLAD -- TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THE OTHER COMMENTS SEEING NONE -- SENATOR TO RUSSIA WOULD YOU LIKE% TO CLOSE WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FOR ALL YOUR QUESTIONS AND JUST ASK FOR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CHAIR. ALRIGHT THE MOTION IS DO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON I WERE JUST. BORDERS NO ALAN. ALLEN I CABALLERO. CABALLERO AYE MONNING. MONNING EYES STERN. I'M BURKE. ARMORED IOWA CASKEY.

WE HAVE ONE MORE MATTER THAT IS BY OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATOR UMBERG IT'S S. J. R.. TO AND THE IF YOU WAIT JUST ONE SECOND SENATOR. I MIGHT INDICATE BEFORE WE START WITH THIS ITEM. WE HAVE RECEIVED NO TIMELY OPPOSITION WE DID NOTE THAT TO TODAY. OF THE ISSUE. THAT THIS BILL OF FOCUSES ON WAS RENDERED ARGUABLY -- MOVED. A GIVEN THAT APPARENTLY THE CONGRESS TODAY DID NOT VOTE. TO OVERTURN THE VETO THE PRESIDENT'S VETO AS THIS. A MEASURE CALLS FOR SO WE DID -- TO I BELIEVE SUBMIT TO SOME PROPOSED. LANGUAGE -- TO A JUDGE FOR THE EVER MOVING CHANGES IN IN. OR A GLACIER SPEED AS THEY MOVE IN IN WASHINGTON BUT THAT WILL REFLECT THAT CHANGE -- WHICH IS NOW BEING PASSED OUT -- IN -- REDID IT FOR IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND ON PAGE -- FOUR AFTER -- FORTY SIX AT LINE. ELEVEN A IT WAS THE MEASURE READ SO LET ME JUST IN CASE THERE'S ANYONE THAT SIR. WANTING TO FOLLOW THIS OUR THE MEASURE RESOLVES OF BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHORTLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE URGES THE HOUSES OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO SAN STAND IN UNITY AND BLOCK THE PRESIDENT'S. NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION OF THIS MORNING IT CALLED FOR A VOTE TO OVERRIDE. BUT APPARENTLY TODAY A VOTE WAS TAKEN THE DID NOT OVERRIDE THAT VETO SO. WHAT IT WILL STATE IS THAT -- AT THE T. M. BLOCK THE PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION OVERRIDING THE PRESIDENT'S VETO. ALL OF THE HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION FORTY SIX AND IF NOT POSSIBLE. TO CONSIDER TERMINATING THE DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITHIN SIX MONTHS OR AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME PURSUANT TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCIES ACT. AND IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN THAT IS AN AMENDMENT WHICH A SORT OF RECOGNIZES THAT ACTION TAKEN TODAY BUT STILL. BELIEVE PROVIDE YOU WITH WHAT YOU WERE -- HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THAT AND IF YOU WOULD ACCEPT THAT AS AN AUTHORS AMENDMENT THAT THAT MAKES. CONTINUES TO MAKE THE RESOLUTION RELEVANT WOULD THAT BE THE CASE THANK YOU SENATOR YES. I DO ACCEPT THAT. EXCELLENT TO THE FLOOR SENATOR IS YOURS AND WELCOME TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. AS WELL AS SENATE HUESO -- WE'VE INCORPORATED SOME OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS WELL THOUGHT OUT APPRECIATED. A COUPLE THINGS THE ISSUE OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION BY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS OBVIOUSLY VERY CONTROVERSY ALL THE ISSUE OF THE WALL IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL. PEOPLE HAVE VERY -- BOTH -- STRONG AND CLOSELY HELD OPINIONS -- WITH RESPECT TO THE WALL THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT THIS FOCUSES ON ITS IMPACT. CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF DIVERTING FUNDING DIVERTING FUNDING FROM PROJECTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY IS DIVERTING MONEY FROM THE COUNTER DRUG BUDGET. EVERY YEAR THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY WHICH I WAS A MEMBER -- COMES UP OF THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY INTO STRATEGY FACT MOST RECENTLY IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PRESIDENT I'D STATES SIGNED OFF ON THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL. POLICY WHICH OUTLINES OUR NATIONAL EFFORT OUR NATIONAL STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH DRUGS. IF YOU SEE IS NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY YOU'LL NOTE THAT NOWHERE IN THERE DOES IT MAKE REFERENCE. TO THE IMPORTANCE OF A WALL WITH RESPECT TO OUR COUNTER DRUG POLICY NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT THE A REDIRECTION OF RESOURCES FROM. IMPORTANT PROJECTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HAS AN IMPACT ON US INTO YOUR POINT MADAM CHAIR WITH RESPECT TO THE HOUSE FAILING TO OVERRIDE THE PRESENCE YOU THIS WILL BE AN ISSUE THAT WILL CONTINUE THIS WILL CONTINUE WELL BEYOND TODAY WILL BE ON THIS YEAR. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE STANDING UP FOR CALIFORNIA BOTH VALUES PRINCIPLES AND RESOURCES MKE A STRONG STATEMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE IN JEOPARDY. SHOULD SHOULD THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY AFFECT HIS DIVERSION OF FUNDS WOULD BE THE NAVY SEAL RESERVE TRAINING FACILITY IN SAN DIEGO. IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN SEAL BEACH THE SEAL BEACH OF WEAPONS STATION -- THERE'S A POSSIBILITY A HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS BEING DIVERTED FROM THE SEAL BEACH WEAPONS STATION -- ALSO IMPACTS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE THE HANGAR AT TRAVIS AIR BASE -- FUNDS A C. ONE THIRTY FLIGHT SIMULATOR CHANNEL ISLANDS NATIONAL GUARD STATION. AND IT IMPACTS -- BOTH MILITARY HOUSING IN TERMS OF LED REMEDIATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE CRITICAL CRITICAL TO OUR NATION'S DEFENSE AND ALSO CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA'S OWN. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO HAVING SAID THAT I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HELLO ONLY -- FORGET MANY HIVE IN CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY -- HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF TIME TO LOOK AT THIS JUST KIND OF CAME ACROSS THIS MORNING -- WE DO SUPPORT THIS WE FEEL THAT THE SENATOR UMBERG -- MAKING THIS RESOLUTION IS A CLEAR STATEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S VALUES IN CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES. AND WE DEFINITELY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS REVIEW TO THE PRESIDENT'S OVERREACH WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. THANK YOU I WOULD NOTE THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A VOTE OF A MAJORITY VOTE TO OVERRIDE BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO REACH THE TWO THIRDS LEVEL TODAY. SO ARE SENATOR MINING IN ANY OTHER. QUESTION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE. THE DETAIL REFLECTED IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT MORE BROADLY -- THIS INITIATIVE OF DIVERTING FUNDS FROM. REALLY NATIONAL SECURITY PROJECTS IT THREATENS IT WEAKENS AND REDUCES. NATIONAL SECURITY -- THROUGHOUT THE NATION IF YOU WILL. IF YOU TAKE WHAT YOU'VE SHARED IS KIND OF A MICROCOSM. OF SIMILAR DIVERSION PROPOSED VERSIONS OF FUNDING. FROM PROGRAMS AROUND THE COUNTRY -- IT'S REALLY QUITE ALARMING I APPRECIATE YOUR PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON IT [inaudible] HOPEFULLY A WISER MINES WILL PREVAIL AS WE MOVE FORWARD. NOT REALLY A QUESTION. OF WHAT WHAT WHAT TO IT WELL WELL SAID SENATOR MINING -- IT IS TRUE THAT THIS HAS NATIONAL IMPACT I AM FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST RECIPIENT OF OF DEFENSE DOLLARS. IN THE PROJECTS THAT ARE OUTLINED THE RESOLUTION ARE CRITICAL NATIONAL DEFENSE. AND TO THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OUR SERVICE WOMEN AND MEN -- ELITE IS. IT'S REALLY AND IT AND IT WHEN I SAY IT'S A SHAME THAT REALLY -- pWE'RE GOING TO TAKE MONEY AND DIVERTED FROM. MILITARY HOUSING WHICH IS THE DILAPIDATED AND SOMETIMES AND HABITABLE AND USE IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES THAT ARE. REQUESTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OFFENSES THAT AREN'T REQUESTED BY THE DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY THAT AREN'T REQUESTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THEY ARE ONLY REQUESTED BY. PRETTY MUCH ONE INDIVIDUAL. THANK YOU A NO THE CONGRESS I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS AN INTERESTING ONE NAY HAVE NOT WEIGHED IN IN SUPPORT SENATOR BOAR BRA. PURCHASE. YOUR I TO WANT -- TO COMMEND YOU -- FOR THE SPIRIT OF OF THIS -- JOINT JOINT RESOLUTION I KNOW YOU START OFF WITH -- THE WALL IS CONTROVERSIAL DECLARATION IS CONTROVERSIAL AND INDEED IT IS AND SOMETIMES I THINK WE LOSE PERSPECTIVE -- IF THERE WERE -- IF THERE WERE WAY. DOWN THE ROAD -- TO HELP PROTECT SOME OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ASSETS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- I DEFINITELY WOULD WANT -- TO SEE THAT MAYBE CAN BE BE A PART OF US OF SUPPORTING -- THAT -- THAT MESSAGE -- I THINK. I THINK THE NATIONAL DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY. IS SOMETHING THAT COMPLETELY NEEDS TO BE REFINED I BELIEVE IN THE WAR POWERS ACT. IN THE SPIRIT OF THE WAR POWERS ACT RISK REQUIRED THAT THERE BE REGULAR -- REPRESENTATIONS MADE CONGRESS THE LIMITATIONS OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER -- WHEN IT COMES TO ONGOING INDEFINITE MILITARY -- ADVENTURES SOME -- IN THIS SITUATION IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE WE DON'T HAVE A DEFINITION. OF DECLARATION I THINK WE DO NEED ONE I THINK WE NEED THERE TO BE TIME TABLES ASSOCIATED WITH -- DECORATIONS LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE -- THERE IS CONTROVERSIAL AS THEY ARE TODAY -- I'M NOT I'LL BE ABSTAINING FROM THIS VOTE ONLY BECAUSE I THINK IT IS. SO CLOUDED AND CONTROVERSY BUT IF THIS COMES BACK AND OTHER FORM AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WITH ANY PROPOSAL THAT -- DIVERTS FUNDS FROM OUR NATIONAL SECURITY -- SYSTEM -- I'D. BE VERY INTERESTED IN TALKING WITH YOU FURTHER MAYBE IN SUPPORTING THAT. IN CENTER BOARD JUST -- I WOULD WELCOME UP TO JOIN WITH YOU TO DEFINE NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND MY GUESS IS WE WOULD BOTH AGREE THAT THIS IS NOT ONE BUT I SUSPECT THAT'S THE CASE UP -- MY UNDERSTANDING TO IS THAT SOME OF THE FUNDING IT WILL BE COMING FROM SOME OF THE DRUG INTERDICTION PROGRAMS AS WELL IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS. MY ASSUMPTION ALTHOUGH THERE'S NOT BEEN COMPLETE DEFINITION WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID IS THAT MONEY'S GOING TO COME FROM THE COUNTER DRUG BUDGET. OF THE COUNTER DRUG BUDGET IS -- IT IS IS -- A PRODUCT OF OUR NATIONAL COUNTER DRUG STRATEGY AND SO THE EXPERTS OR AT LEAST THE PEOPLE THAT THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES OUR EXPERTS HAVE COME UP WITH THE COUNTER DRUG STRATEGY IN A COUNTER DRUG BUDGET. THAT MEETS THAT STRATEGY -- THIS IS SEPARATE AND APART FROM THAT STRATEGY THE US FUNDS ARE BEING DIVERTED FROM WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S EXPERTS SAY THEY SHOULD BE USED. FOR FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE I WOULD SIMPLY SUGGEST THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GO WITH HIS OWN EXPERTS. WITH THAT WOULD BE A CHANGE IN STRATEGY BY I THINK THIS WHITE HOUSE BUT OF I THINK THE PART THAT STRIKES ME WHEN IT COMES TO THIS DRUG THE DRUG PROGRAMS THIS MORNING AND PUBLIC SAFETY. ONE OF CENTER BOARD USES COLLEAGUES BROUGHT A BILL -- TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE FRONT NO PROBLEM. WE KNOW THE FENNEL IS COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY IN MASSIVE AND VERY DANGEROUS QUANTITIES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD -- I WOULD THINK THAT A IF WE REALLY DO WANT TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF OUR PEOPLE WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO FUND THESE. DRUG INTERDICTION PROGRAMS -- SO THAT WE COULD INDEED PROTECT OUR OUR PEOPLE IN THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY AND IT WAS REALLY NO DISPUTE THAT THE THE MAJOR PROBLEM COMES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. AND THOSE DRUGS WE KNOW COME IN. EARLY THROUGH AIRPORTS IN OUR PORTS AND IF THE MONEY'S BEING TAKEN FROM THAT THAT FURTHER EXPOSES. A ALL IN OUR CHILDREN AND WHAT HAVE YOU TO THE KIND OF HARM ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE DRUGS SO. I AM MOST APPRECIATIVE OF THE SPIRIT OF THIS MEASURE -- I DON'T FIND IT CLOUDED AT ALL I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT -- WE DO HAVE REAL NEED AND THE TO THERE SHOULD BE THAT ARE THE CONGRESS SHOULD ACTUALLY STEP UP -- STRAP ON THE SPINE AND START DOING IN USING OUR TAX MONEY FOR WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING -- THATINTO DOLLARS I CAN STILL GET MY COFFEE IN THE MORNING I'M SURE BUT IT IS FRUSTRATING TO SEE AND I DO THANK YOU AS WELL FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD SO.
