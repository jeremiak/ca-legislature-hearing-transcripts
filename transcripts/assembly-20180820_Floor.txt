REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE INCLUDING BIRTH CONTROL CANCER SCREENINGS AND TESTING AND TREATMENT FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. THE UNITED STATES IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A THIRTY YEAR LOW FOR UNPLANNED PREGNANCY THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE AVAILABILITY OF PREVENTION. THIS PROGRAM SERVES FOUR MILLION PEOPLE EACH YEAR AND CALIFORNIA IS HOME 225% OF TITLE TEN PATIENTS NATIONWIDE. YET DESPITE THESE OUTCOMES AND HOW MANY LOW INCOME PATIENTS RELY ON SUCH SERVICES THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED A DOMESTIC GAG RULE FOR TITLE TEN PROVIDERS. EVEN THOUGH IT HAS RECEIVED WIDESPREAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR DECADES. THE GAG RULE WOULD PROHIBIT CLINICIANS FROM GIVING DIRECT REFERRALS FOR ABORTION TO THEIR PATIENTS OR EVEN TALKING ABOUT ABORTION PREVENTING PATIENTS FROM GETTING THE COMPLETE AND HONEST MEDICAL INFORMATION THEY DESERVE. FROM DOCTORS THAT THEY TRUST. THE GAG RULE BUILDS A WALL BETWEEN MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE WHICH IS WHY THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND COMMENTS OPPOSING THE PROPOSED RULE FROM CALIFORNIA ALONE.

PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEES UTILITY COMMITTEES [inaudible] WITH. IS THAT REFERRING TO THOSE GROUPS [inaudible] THANK YOU. I SEE NO OTHER REQUESTED SPEAKS ALL I'M. SOME MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAY ANSWER BRIEFLY AND THEN WE'LL RETURN TO MISTER SCHABAS. I I I I WILL CHECK ON THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS JUST STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS SO ALRIGHT OF TO SHUT US. DIMITRY RESPONSE DO LIKE I CAN SEE THE GREAT VALUE OF THAT THE LOCAL COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT ARE THE VALUE IS CITIZENSHIP I SPOKE VERY STRONGLY AGAINST. NON CITIZEN JURIES BUT AND THE COMMITTEE SPECIAL LOCAL CITIES I CAN SEE THE GREAT VALUE IN TRYING TO GET THE COMMUNITY INVOLVED VESTED PUBLIC SAFETY THINGS SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME EVER CARILLO YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE AS A PRINCIPAL CHO AUTHOR OF SP ONE SEVENTY FOUR AS AN IMMIGRANT FROM INSIDE Y. THOUGH IT AND A FIRST JUNE GENERATION AMERICAN I'VE WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD TO GET TO WHERE I AM TODAY AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A PATH FOR MANY. PEOPLE.

THEIR WHOLE LIVES UNABLE TO PURSUE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT OUR STATE CONSOLE MUCH BENEFIT FROM. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE NOT FAR FROM SERVING OUR STATE. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT WHERE YOU ARE BORN SHOULD NOT BE AN OBSTACLE TO GETTING AN EDUCATION APPLYING FOR PROFESSIONAL LICENSE OR PURSUING YOUR DREAMS. S. B. ONE SEVENTY FOUR TO CRITICAL MEASURE THAT SOLIDIFIES CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP. IN AN AREA OF IMMIGRANT ACCEPTANCE AND INTEGRATION.

TEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM. A BROKEN. UNJUST UNFAIR UNSAFE. PORTION OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING MORE FAIR. AND MORE SAFE THAT IS BASED ON AND INDIVIDUALS UNIQUE RISK THAT THEY POSE FOR FLIGHT. OR TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS WILL BE A PARADIGM SHIFTING. MOVING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM [inaudible] WHOSE TIME [inaudible] HAS COME. WE WILL BE MOVING FROM A MONEY BASED SYSTEM TO A RISK BASED SYSTEM. OUR CURRENT MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IS [inaudible] FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM JUDGES INDIVIDUALS BY [inaudible] THE SIZE. OF THEIR WALLET. INSTEAD OF THE SIZE OF THEIR RISK. IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM FREEDOM [inaudible] AND LIBERTY. IS PAY TO PLAY. IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. AND YOU CAN PAY FOR IT YOU CAN BE FREE. REGARDLESS OF YOUR SAFETY RISK REGARDLESS OF THE RISK OF FAILING TO SHOW FOR YOUR NEXT HEARING. IF YOU DON'T. AND EVEN IF YOU WILL. SHOP AGAIN NEXT HEARING AND THE COURT HEARING AFTER THAT. AND EVEN IF YOU ARE NO RISK TO THE PUBLIC. YOU WITH WAGE ALLEN LANGUISHING IN JAIL. AND THAT IS WRONG. AND WE CAN CHANGE IT TODAY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN RECOGNIZED. WIDELY THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND FROM LEADERS RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE [inaudible] OUR CURRENT [inaudible] CHIEF JUSTICE. JUST THE TONIC UNTIL SAKU UNIT KNOWS THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN SHE CALLED IT UNSAFE [inaudible] AND UNFAIR. A REPORT THAT SHE COMMISSION FOUND THE SAME. AND RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE THAT. LARGELY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND OUR BILL I DON'T GOVERNOR. FORTY YEARS AGO. SAID THAT THE BILL IS A TAX ON POOR PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LANGUISH IN THE JAILS IN THE STATE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVEN'T. THERE BEEN CONVICTED OF NO CRIME THEIR ONLY CRIME IS THAT THEY CANNOT MAKE THE BAIL THAT ARE PRESENT LAW REQUIRES. IN COLLEGE THE HUMAN IMPACTS ARE DEVASTATING. WHEN INDIVIDUALS WHO POSE NO RISK TO THE PUBLIC? BUT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY LANGUISHING IN JAIL. SO MANY DEVASTATING THINGS CAN HAPPEN TO THEM IN THEIR FAMILIES AND THEY HAVE. AND IT WILL CONTINUE UNLESS. WE TAKE ACTION TODAY INDIVIDUALS CAN. LOSE THEIR JOBS. BECAUSE THEY'RE STUCK IN JAIL AND CAN SHOW UP FOR WORK. THEY CAN LOSE THEIR CARS BECAUSE THEY'RE PARKING A TIME LIMITED AREA. AND IT GETS TOTAL WAY. AND THEY NEVER SEE IT AGAIN. THEY CAN LOSE THEIR HOMES IF THEY'RE IN JAIL THE CAPITA MORTGAGE ARE THEIR RENT THE CAN EVEN LOSE THEIR KIDS IF THEY'RE SINGLE PARENT IS KNOWN TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS. ALL BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY POSE NO RISK. DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE POCKET. AND EVEN THOSE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO PAY BAIL. SUFFER AND SUFFER MIGHTILY. THEY'RE ABLE TO SCRAPE TOGETHER THE AVERAGE. I AM REFUNDABLE BAIL AMOUNT OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR AMOUNT BAIL. THEY OFTEN HAVE TO FORGO PAYING OTHER BILLS. OR OTHER THINGS FOR THEIR FAMILY AND COLLEAGUES [inaudible] AS THIS. CURRENT BROKEN SYSTEM HAS CREATED. SUCH UNFAIRNESS SUCH INJUSTICE. IT ALSO HAS FAILED TO MAKE US SAFER. BECAUSE IT'S NOT BASED ON SAFETY. IT'S NOT BASED ON ONE'S RISK. IT'S BASED ON WEALTH. AN ARBITRARY AN IRRELEVANT FACTOR [inaudible] UNRELATED. TO RISK AND SAFETY PEOPLE. WHO DON'T SHOW FOR FUTURE COURT HEARINGS AND WHO WON'T SHOW FOR A A FUTURE COURT HEARING AND ARE A SAFETY RISK? CAN PAY TO GET OUT. IF THEY CAN POST THE BELL. THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO RELEASE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR SAFETY RISK IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. AS LONG AS THEY PAY THAT STEVIE. WITH NO REGARD. DO DANGER TO THE PUBLIC AND WITH NO CONSEQUENCE TO THE BAIL BONDSMAN IF THAT PERSON WHO WAS RELEASED ON THEIR BELT BOND. TIMES A MEMBER. OF THE PUBLIC. SO WHAT IS THIS BILL DEAL. IT MOVES US. IN A FAIR DIRECTION. A SAFER DIRECTION. EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS TREATED AS AN INDIVIDUAL THAT GIVEN AND RISK ASSESSMENT OF BY A VALIDATED TOOL. THERE ARE PRETRIAL SERVICES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE TO OVERSEE WHEN SAFE THEIR RELEASE INTO THE COMMUNITY WITH THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS. INDIVIDUALS NO LONGER HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY OF THOSE CONDITIONS THAT OFF TO PAY FOR THEIR ELECTRONIC MONITORING IF THAT'S A CONDITION OF THEIR RELEASE THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR OTHER CONDITIONS. FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ARRESTED FOR LOW LEVEL NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT MISDEMEANORS WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEY'LL BE RELEASED BACK TO THE COMMUNITY SAFELY. OTHERS WILL GET A RISK ASSESSMENT BY TREETOP PRETRIAL SERVICES THEY WILL BE DESIGNATED EITHER LOW RISK. OUT WHICH IS A MINIMAL RISK MEDIUM RISK WHICH IS A MODERATE RISK OR HIGH RISK WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR LOW RISK OFFENDERS. THEY WILL BE RELEASED BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY WITH THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE NAM MONETARY CONDITIONS SAFELY. AND FOR THOSE IN MEDIUM RISK CATEGORIES SOME WILL GO TO A JUDGE SOME COULD BE RELEASED AT THE PRETRIAL SERVICES LEVEL. AND THEN FOR THE HIGHEST RISK -- INDIVIDUALIST THEY'LL GO TO A JUDGE. AND THERE THEY WILL HAVE DUE PROCESS TO BE REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY THEY'LL HAVE A HEARING WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR CASE THE BE ABLE TO PRESENT THE FACTS ARGUMENTS -- THE CONTEXT OF OF WHO THEY ARE TO A JUDGE AND BE DECIDED ON BASS DOESN'T BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL. OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES NOT BASED ON HOW MUCH MONEY. THEY HAVE IN THEIR POCKET AND THESE CHANGES WERE GUIDED BY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS. BY JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND CIVIL LIBERTARIANS AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN. AND WE RELY ON THE DEEP DIVE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DID TO HELP GUIDE. THIS POLICY THAT WILL MAKE US SAFER. AND WILL BE MORE JUST AND COLLEAGUES THIS. BILL REALLY RELIES ON SOME OF THE FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF WHO WE ARE AS A STATE. AND AS A NATION. THAT OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE SHOULD NOT BE. PAY TO PLAY THAT ONE'S WEALTH. SHOULD NOT BE AN OBSTACLE. TWO ONE'S LIBERTY. THAT WE SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS. AND ASSESSED BASED ON WHAT WE'VE DONE OR NOT DONE THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHO WE ARE BASED ON OUR CONDUCT OUR BEHAVIOR. AND NOT BE SUBJECTED TO SOME ONE SIZE FITS ALL BAIL SCHEDULE THAT RENDERS THE INDIVIDUAL INVISIBLE. AND TREAT YOU AS A NUMBER OR POCKETBOOK OR AN ATM. AND THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THEIR CASE BE REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY AND PRESENT ALL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY WISH TO A NEUTRAL ARBITER. BECAUSE THIS IS. A HUGE CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. THIS IS TRANSFORMATIONAL. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY. SEIZE THE MOMENT. AND DO SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA A SAFER. THAT WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE FAIR. THAT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE JUST. WE PRIDE OURSELVES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN LEADING IN GOING FIRST IN MAKING THE BIG CHANGES. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THE PAGE ON A FAILED BROKEN UNSAFE UNFAIR. MONEY BASED SYSTEM. IT'S A MOVE TOWARDS A RISK BASED SYSTEM. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. TEN THANK YOU IT SOME MEMBER LACKEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. WE HAVE ORDER PLEASE. SOME MEMBER LACKEY. YEAH THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBERS. YOU KNOW I HEARD FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR THAT THIS BILL REFORM WAS GOING TO BE A PRIORITY. BUT YET HERE WE ARE TWO WEEKS OUT. AND THIS GETS WORKED A FOR HOW DESPICABLE. SOMETHING HAS A CRITICALLY IS A BUT IMPORTANT. AS HOW WE HOLD PEOPLE IN CUSTODY. PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED VERY VERY DANGEROUS OFFENSES. BUT BECAUSE OF A BROKEN SYSTEM WE HAVE THIS HURRIED POLICY THAT WE'RE GONNA JAM TOGETHER. HOW DO WE LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES IN THE PAST WILL YOU DONE THOSE KIND OF HURRY POLICY? THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE SEVERE PEOPLE. VICTIMS VICTIMS ARE REAL. I HAD THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES OF FACING SOME OF THESE VICTIMS. AND TELLING THEM THE WORST THING POSSIBLE. THEIR LOVED ONE IS GONE. AND I KNOW NO. ONE WHO IS CRAFTED THIS BILL HAS THE DESIRE TO STE TO HAVE THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WILLIS JUST TALK ABOUT THIS BILL FOR JUST A SECOND. THE ONLY WAY SOMEONE. STAYS IN JAIL. IS THAT THE PROSECUTION PUTS ON A LITTLE MINI TRIAL. AND THEN THE TRIAL THEY HAVE TO PROVE WITH CLEAR CONVINCING EVIDENCE. BUT THAT PERSON IS A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC OR A FLIGHT RISK. OTHERWISE EVERYONE ELSE GETS OUT. FOLKS THAT IS NOT GOOD POLICY. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. I TOTALLY AGREE. THERE ARE BILL SYSTEM IS BROKEN. AND WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER. COLLECTIVELY [inaudible] CALMLY. AND IN IT ANY UNIFIED. WELL THOUGHT OUT PROCESS. NOT A HURRIED. PANICKY OF THE POLICY LIKE THIS IS COMING TO US. WE COULD DO BETTER THAN THIS AND WE HAVE. TO I ASK YOUR NO VOTE. IF YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER. A COUPLE OF POINTS I WANT TO RISE TO IN REGARDS TO THIS ONE I THINK THAT THE A MISDEMEANOR SEX OFFENDERS WILL BE RELEASED. WITHOUT A RISK ASSESSMENT ASSESSMENT UNDER THIS BILL THE BILL'S EXEMPTION LANGUAGE ON THIS POINT IS A LOOSER HE SINCE IT REFERS TO THE OFFENSES THAT ARE NOT MISDEMEANORS. AND WOULD HAVE NO RISK ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE THEM TO BE HIGH RISK. IT REFERS ALSO TO THE PROVISION OF LAW WHICH DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT MANAGE VICAR MEMBERS. BILL BETTER INSURERS OFFENDERS SHOW UP IN COURT THAN THIS SYSTEM HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY OF THE 540-005-0090 EIGHT WARRANTS IN THE SYSTEM. TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX OUR OWN PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED ON BAIL THE BALANCE OF THE TWO HAVE BEEN RELEASED ON THEIR OWN RECOGNIZANCE BAIL IS A BETTER WAY OF ENSURING OFFENDERS APPEAR AND IF THEY DON'T GETTING THEM BACK IN COURT. I THINK THAT THIS IS A RISKY. POTENTIAL SYSTEM UNDER THIS BILL. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE PUTTING THE LIVES. AND THE HEALTH AND THE WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIAN CALIFORNIANS AT RISK BY PASSING THIS BILL I STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE. SOME EVER CUNNINGHAM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS GOT. THREE POINT THREE ARGUMENTS TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IN THE HOPES THAT SOME OF YOU ARE SITTING ON THE FENCE. THINK DEEPLY ABOUT THE JUMP THE LEAP YOU'RE ABOUT TO MAKE. ON BEHALF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST ARGUMENTS REALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE PROCESS AS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT. YOU LOSE SOMETHING IN MAKING LEGISLATION WHEN YOU RUSH IT. YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO TO DELIBERATE TO BRING IN EXPERTS BRING IN PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. SOME OF YOU AND I DON'T MEAN ANY OFFENSE BUT SOME YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JAIL BAIL AND A BALE OF HAY. AND THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT A SLIGHT. THAT'S THAT'S A REALITY WE'RE ALL TRYING TO MAKE POLICY IN A COMPLEX DIVERSE ENORMOUS STATE WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO DELIBERATE AND BRING IN EXPERTS AND THINK ABOUT THINGS AND RUN THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS. THAT WE ALL TRUST TO RELY ON I COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE WITH. THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATION AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH. AND THIS IS NO SMALL CHANGE. MAKE NO MISTAKE IF YOU DON'T WORK IN THIS INDUSTRY THIS IS A GIANT [inaudible] GIANT WIFE CHANGING LIFE ALTERING CHANGE. FOR EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW MEXICO COPY AND PASTED TO CALIFORNIA. WE'RE BIGGER WERE MORE DIVERSE WE HAVE UNIQUE CHALLENGES UNIQUE LAWS AND UNIQUE PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES. THE SECOND POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS TO ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THIS WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT A BILL. A BILL THAT HAS BEEN RUSHED IN THE PROCESS TO THE FOR WHEN THE OPPOSITION GROUPSINCLUDE. THE ACLU. THE END DOUBLE ACP. THE BAIL BONDS COALITION LET'S PROBABLY OBVIOUS. LOTS OF SHARES FROM AROUND THE STATE. LOTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS FROM AROUND THE STATE. POLICE CHIEFS IN CRIME VICTIMS UNITED WAS IT SAY DOES THAT TELL YOU IS THAT THE INDICATION OF A FULLY BAKED BILL IS THAT THE INDICATION. OF A POLICY THAT WE CAN ALL GET BEHIND SINCE WE'RE CHANGING. THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TODAY. LASTLY TO THE MERITS THE BILL UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM. I'M NOT I'M NOT HERE TO THE BILL'S PERFECT. THERE'S CHANGES WE CAN MAKE THERE'S THINGS WE CAN APPROVE. WE'RE DOING PILOT PROGRAMS ALL THE TIME. WHAT'S WRONG THE PILOT PROGRAM. WHAT'S TRIED OUT FIND THE WORST PLACE FIND THE COUNTY WHERE IT'S THE MOST BROKEN WHEREVER THAT IS. TRY A PILOT PROGRAM OUT FOR AWHILE STUDY IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS. SEE IF IT ACTUALLY MAKES US MORE SAFE PEOPLE SEE PEOPLE SHOW UP. AND NOT FAIL TO APPEAR IN COURT. UNDER THE NEW RISK ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. WE'RE GONNA HAND WE'RE GONNA THIS IS WHERE DOES. TRUST ME ON THIS WE'RE GONNA TAKE POWER AWAY FROM JUDGES AND AWAY FROM ATTORNEYS THAT THE CHANCE ARGUE. WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE BAIL AND WHAT AMOUNT SHOULD BE SET UP. AND A JUDGE HAS THE POWER THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO THE SIDE THAT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A DAY ARE IN COURT. EVERY SINGLE DAY IN CALIFORNIA AND JUDGES ARE MAKING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THESE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL FACTS IN FRONT OF THEM. THE PERSON'S HISTORY WHETHER THEY FAILED TO APPEAR THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME THE RISK THEY POST THE PUBLIC THAT'S ALREADY BEING DONE BY A JUDGE UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM THIS WOULD WHITE MOST OF THAT AWAY. AND LEAVE THE BUREAUCRACY UNDER FUNDED. TO DO EVEN MORE WORK. AND I'M SORRY FOLKS YOU CAN'T REDUCE EVERYTHING IN LIFE TO AN ALGORITHM. TO A COMPUTER PROGRAM. I HAVE SEEN AS A PROSECUTOR AND AS A AS A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY I'VE SEEN HUNDREDS OF CASES WERE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS. FAILED THEY FAILED VICTIMS AND PEOPLE AND DEFENDANTS ON ALL DIFFERENT SITES. YOU CAN'T JUST. TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF A COMPUTER AND PRESS A BUTTON. GET A PREDICTION THAT'S GONNA ALLOW YOU TO MAKE AN INTELLIGENT CHOICE ABOUT WHETHER SOMETHING SAFER NOT. WHETHER SOMEBODY'S GONNA APPEAR IN COURT OR FLIGHT REST WHETHER THEY'RE DANGER TO THE PUBLIC. LASTLY I'D SUGGEST PART OF THE REASON YOU SEEN SOME OF THESE GROUPS LIKE THE ACLU. WHICH I'VE FOUGHT A IN THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE I'VE FOUGHT THEM ALL SORTS OF BILLS MA'AM BUT ONCE IN A WHILE THEY ARE ON POINT. AND THEY'RE ON POINT WITH THIS. ONE THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO SOME PEOPLE [inaudible] WHO? HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING INCARCERATED YOU KNOW THERE'S A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BEAR. YOU HAVE A RIGHT. TO POST BAIL UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. I'M NOT SURE THIS BUILDING CONSTITUTION. IT'S A PRE TRIAL DETENTION. IT HAS A DETENTION BEFORE ANYBODY A JURY OR A JUDGE HAS TOLD YOU YOU'RE GUILTY. IT'S A DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO POST BAIL ON ALMOST EVERY OFFENSE THERE IS. UNDER THE LAW. SO YOU CAN WORK WITH YOUR ATTORNEY AND REMAIN ON INCARCERATED WILL YOU PREPARE FOR TRIAL OR GET YOUR CASE RESULT. THIS IS GOING TO DIMINISH OUT RIGHT FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE. ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE'S GOING TO BE DANGEROUS PEOPLE THAT. ARE GOING TO BE OUT. AND ARE GOING TO FAIL TO APPEAR IN COURT AT THEIR COURT DAY. THE FAILURE TO APPEAR RATE. FOR REGARDLESS OF OFFENSE FOR PEOPLE ACCUSED OF FELONIES IS INCREDIBLY HIGH. GO STUDY THAT DATA PLEASE STUDY THAT IT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT FAIL TO APPEAR. THAT R. BLASTS TO REMAIN AT LARGE IN PUBLIC BY BUREAUCRACY. THE GO OUT DO TERRIBLE THINGS TO BE. SOME MEMBER IF YOU CAN BRING YOUR ARGUMENTS WILL CLOSE YOUR TIME. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES SOUTH FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR ENGAGING IN WHAT HAS BEEN A LONG PROCESS AND A AND A CHALLENGING PROCESS AND LET ME FIRST START BY TALKING ABOUT PROCESS. SINCE WE LAST DEBATED THIS ISSUE ON THIS FLOOR YEAR AGO THERE HAVE BEEN. LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF MEETINGS HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS INVOLVING STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE GOVERNOR. TWO JUDGES TO MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO FOLKS WHO FIGHT FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE PROGRESSIVE VALUES OF WATER STATER ABOUT. A AND I WANNA THANK MISTER BONTA AS WELL AS THE SENATE AUTHOR THIS BILL FOR THEIR WORK ON SINCE WE LAST VOTED ON THIS BILL. THIS BILL. HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF PUBLIC SAFETY SO FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE GONNA BE ENSURING THAT HIGH RISK DEFENDANTS NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY. TO BAIL BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE'VE ALL FOUND OFFENSIVE ABOUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE FACT IS IF YOU'RE WEALTHY. YOU CAN BUY [inaudible] FREEDOM. THAT A POOR PERSON CANNOT THAT IS GONNA CHANGE IN THIS BILL WERE ALSO ENSURING THE VICTIMS RIGHTS OR STRENGTHENING SIGNIFICANTLY. WITH NOTICING PROVISIONS PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS THE DA'S MAKE BEST EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS TO ALLOW FOR THE VOICING OF VICTIMS IN OUR SYSTEM. I KNOW AND I VERY MUCH RESPECT THE PERSPECTIVE THE FORMER MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR BODY I WILL SAY AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR. IT ALWAYS PAINED ME WHEN I KNEW THAT THERE WERE POOR PEOPLE AND OUR SYSTEM BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE POOR HAD TO SIT IN JAIL. WHO WOULD LOSE THEIR HOMES WHO'D LOSER FAMILIES WHO WOULD LOSE PROPERTY WHO WOULD LOSE OUR HEALTH? WHO WOULD GET BACK IN THE ENDLESS CYCLE OF POVERTY AND CRIME THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO CHANGE TODAY? WHEN IT COMES TO THE CONSTITUTION I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE? THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION THE PRINCIPLE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE BEING PROVEN GUILTY. IN THIS STATE ONLY APPLIES IF YOU'RE WEALTHY. THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO EQUAL PROTECTION HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE MONEY BILL SYSTEM. LET ME ALSO SAY AND I WILL SAY THIS IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. THIS MAY NOT BE THE PERFECT BILL. IT MAY NOT GO AS FAR AS PEOPLE MAY WANT EITHER TO THE SO CALLED LEFT OR TO THE SO CALLED RIGHT. BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL THAT WE HAD TO VOTE ON LAST YEAR BUT THAT'S NOT THE BILL WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. THIS BILL TRIES TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH. BUT WE NEED. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD COLLEAGUES I HOPE. THAT YOU WILL JOIN US IN MAKING HISTORY TODAY TO END A MONEY BILL SYSTEM. THAT HAS VIOLATED CONSTITUTIONS THAT HAS ENSURED THAT POOR PEOPLE CONTINUE TO REMAIN VICTIMIZED IN OUR STATE. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM DID NOT START WITH S. B. TEN IT'S NOT GONNA END WITH S. B. TEN WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. THIS BILL HAS MANY MANY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE CONTINUE TO STUDY PERFECT TO MAKE IT BETTER. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I HOPE WE CAN ALL JOIN. IN TAKING A STEP FORWARD IN REFORMING A SYSTEM THAT IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF REFORM. AS ROBERT F. KENNEDY SAID FIFTY YEARS AGO. MADAM SPEAKER PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION ONLY ONE FACTOR DETERMINES WHETHER DEFENDANT STAYS IN JAIL BEFORE IT COMES TO TRIAL. THAT FACTOR IS NOT GUILT OR INNOCENCE IT IS NOT THE NATURE OF THE CRIME. IT IS NOT THE CHARACTER OF THE DEFENDANT. THAT FACTOR SIMPLY IS MONEY. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- YOU KNOW WHEN THIS BILL FIRST CAME UP. I DIDN'T SUPPORT IT I DID VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE I'M TERRIFIED. I AM TERRIFIED THAT I AM BECOME THE COMMUNITY WATCH. AT MY HOUSE WITH PEOPLE SHOWING UP. IN FRONT OF MY DOOR TO TRY AND STEAL PACKAGES WHEN I'M UP HERE MY WIFE AND MY CHILD ARE HOME ALONE. UNLIKELY I HAVE GREAT MEMBER -- NEIGHBORS AND WE ALL TRY TO LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER BUT I'M TERRIFIED ABOUT BEING UP HERE NOT BEING ABLE TO BE HOME TO PROTECT MY FAMILY [inaudible] SCARES. AND SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IS IF I TAKE A VOTE ON BAIL REFORM. CAN I HONESTLY SAY THAT I'M DOING SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA PROVIDE MORE SAFETY. TO MY FAMILY WHEN I'M GONE. AND I REALLY RESPECT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE AUTHOR I RESPECT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY MY COLLEAGUE. FROM OAKLAND BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN A LOT OF TIME TO SAY THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH TIME AND CONSIDERATION PUT INTO THIS MEASURE THAT'S NOT TRUE. HAS BEEN A LOT OF TIME PUT INTO THIS MEASURE I CARE ABOUT PROCESS MY FATHER HAD A CAREER OVER TWENTY YEARS IN THIS BY TALKING ABOUT PROCESS. THIS PROCESS IS RIGHT THIS PROCESS IS NO DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE'VE DONE AND YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY. ALL I WANT. IS TO KNOW THAT I'M DOING SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE MAKES. MICE CONSTITUENTS SAFER MAKES IN MY FAMILY SAFER. WHERE AND WHEN THEY'RE AT HOME? AND THE PROBLEM THAT I'VE HAD WITH BAIL AND IN THE ME LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS -- I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST ANYONE. I HAVE NOTHING AGANST THE BAIL AGENTS NOTHING AGAINST THE CO YOU THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHO SUPPORTS AND WHO OPPOSES THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE DO AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I AM SICK AND TIRED OF UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS. IS THIS ABILITY FOR US TO ALWAYS JUST PROTECT THE STATUS QUO BECAUSE WE'RE SO AFRAID OF WHAT THE CHANGE IS GOING TO BE. YOU CANNOT CREATE ANY TYPE OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE SOME KIND OF A RISK TO TRY SOMETHING NEW. TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND I HAVE MY CONCERNS THIS IS NOT A PERFECT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT I THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH. FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY WE LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO COMMIT CRIMES. HOW THEIR HELD WHY THEY'RE HELD AND HAVE SOME TYPE OF ASSESSMENT AND HAVE THIS THE ASSESSMENT ON THEIR ABILITY TO RE OFFEND BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE SHOULD BE OUT? OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE THEIR BILL THE ABILITY TO PAY SOMEBODY CAN GOING TO AMEND MURDER GET A MILLION DOLLAR. BOND SAID AND THEN THEY CAN BAIL OUT BUT THEIR MURDER AND LOOK AT THEIR CUES OF BEING A MURDERER WERE UNDER THIS THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THAT SAME ABILITY. AND SO IT'S TAKING A LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES OF HOW WE SET. UP WHETHER THE BAIL SCHEDULE IS BETTER OR RISK ASSESSMENT IS BETTER BETTER AND I THINK THAT IN THIS INSTANCE A RISK ASSESSMENT IS A FAR BETTER TOOL TO ASSESS SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO RE OFFEND OR FAN OR CONTINUE TO VICTIMIZE AS OPPOSED TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE THE MONEY. TO BAIL THEMSELVES OUT OR NOT AN ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP -- WAS THIS THIS THIS ISSUE OF TWO NINETY IN MISDEMEANOR SEX CRIMES. THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE I HAVE A DAUGHTER NOBODY KNOWS I'M GONNA TELL YOU NOW I HAVE ANOTHER DAUGHTER ON THE WAY. AND THAT THAT TERRIFIES ME THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME -- NOW I'VE TALKED TO THE DA'S I SPOKE TO JACKIE LACEY -- THIS THIS AFTERNOON A SKINNY THIS MORNING ON MY WAY UP HERE AND SHE SAID HE AND I NEED YOU TO PLEASE VOTE ON THIS BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO MAKE COMMUNITY SAFER. THIS GIVES US MORE TOOLS TO KEEP THOSE P. OUR MOST SERIOUS OFFENDERS FROM BEING UP BAY BEING ABLE TO GO OUT AND CREATE COULD COMMIT MORE CRIMES. AGAINST YOUR CONSTITUENTS AGAINST YOUR FAMILY ARE AND AND SO THIS ISSUE OF THE MISDEMEANOR SEX CRIMES WELL AS IT IS RIGHT NOW IF THEY CAN CHARGE A FELONY WELL IF YOU GET CHARGED WITH A FELONY WHICH IS WHAT THE DA SO WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE GOING. FOR YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUT BUT ASSUMING THAT YOU DON'T GET CHARGED WITH A FELONY IT STAYS THE MISDEMEANOR WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS. DO YOU END UP GETTING A TWO THREE HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR BOND ABOUT WHICH EVERYBODY'S IT IS IS ABLE TO PAY FOR EVERYBODY'S ABLE TO FORCE OF THESE PEOPLE ALREADY OUT. AND SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IS AMENDMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING IN A BILL S. B.. TEN FIFTY FOUR I AND WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING TO FIX THIS ISSUE -- MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEIR CONCERNS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT WE THAT WE TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BUT THINK ABOUT THIS. TOO OWE YOU KNOW WHY DON'T YOU JUST FIXING OUR YOU KNOW THEIR BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF ARGUMENTS ARE GOING TO BE MADE ABOUT THIS. BUT NOTHING IS PERFECT THE FIRST TIME WE PASS IT IS ABOUT CREATING THAT'S THAT CHANGED TAKING THAT FIRST BIG STEP. ON THE MOON WE PASS ON THIS FLOOR -- LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WITHIN PASSING KNOWING THAT WE WOULD NEVER COME BACK TO FIX IT WE PASS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PROBLEMS THAT ARE GOING TO RISE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK AND FIX AND LO AND BEHOLD THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD TO DO AND WE'RE STILL DOING TO FIX LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO MAKE IT THE BEST POLICY. POSSIBLE UP BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO HERE AND I THINK THAT. THE RISK ASSESSMENT IS A FAR BETTER TOOL THAN BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A BAIL THE BAIL YOURSELF OUT OF JAIL I THINK IT'S SAFER FOR OUR COMMUNITIES I FEEL SAFER WITH THAT TYPE OF SYSTEM ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT MY DE A IS TELLING ME. THAT THIS IS WHAT INTO HER OFFICE CAN DO TO KEEP ME AND MY FAMILY SAFE I EVEN WHEN I'M NOT AROUND. NOTHING'S EVER PERFECT BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD FIRST STEP AND WE CAN'T BE AFRAID OF CHANGE BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EMBRACE THINGS. THAT ARE GOING TO HELP US ATON CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL OF US BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR KIDS THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING ON HERE FOR IS TO MAKE SURE I MAKE IT BETTER -- SAFER COMMUNITY FOR MY KIDS I AM GONNA STAY CONTINUALLY. COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE OUR AND MAKING SURE THAT ANY ISSUES THAT ARISE THAT WE FIX IT THAT'S OUR JOB SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER LOOK. I'VE BEEN BEFORE YOU PROBABLY MORE TIMES AND YOU NEVER WANT TO SEE OPTIMAL JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. AS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN TRUE OR NOT I BELIEVE IT. AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM. THE REASON I GET UP WHEN I WHEN. WHETHER I LOSE I KEEP COMING BACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE I'VE SEEN WHAT THIS SYSTEM DOES I'VE SEEN WHAT IT DOES TO FAMILIES AND I'VE SEEN WHAT THE BAIL SYSTEM HAS DONE. RIGHT NOW VERY SIMPLY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. REPLACING THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM WITH A RISK ASSESSMENT SAYS AND PART OF THE BANKS THAT WE HAVE. IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE WE HAVE A WE HAVE SOME COMFORT LEVEL [inaudible] BUT BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THE SIX YEAR RULE WE'VE GOT ABDICATED OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT THINGS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILLS IN THE LEGISLATION THAT WE PUSH. FOR WILL ACTUALLY READ HAVE THE RESULT THAT WE WANT BECAUSE WE'VE ABDICATED THAT FOR SO LONG FULLER UNCOMFORTABLE. I'M MAKING A COMMITMENT THAT ALTHOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE THE PERFECT SOLUTION. A GREAT FIRST STEP. IT MOVES US IN THE DIRECTION OF WHAT WE ALL WANT TO BE WANT TO HAVE IS A FAIR SYSTEM. AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE YOU KNOW. I'VE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A TWILIGHT ZONE. YOU KNOW I HAVE THE ACLU COMING AT ME SAYING. WE'RE GONNA LOCK UP MORE PEOPLE MORE POOR PEOPLE MORE AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE BE LOCKED UP. BY THE BILL BONDS PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE SAY WELL LET A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE OUT. RAPISTS AND MURDERERS. IN THAT IRONIC. YOU GOT TWO DIFFERENT SIDES TO JUST EXTREME SITE SAME EXACT OPPOSITE. FOR ME WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. STRADDLES RIGHT IN BETWEEN WHERE WE NEED TO GO START MOVING TOWARD THAT ULTIMATE GOAL. LOOK OUT. I LOVE HISTORY. YOU KNOW DOCTOR KING WANTED TO NONVIOLENCE AND IF ANY OF YOU KNOW. DURING THAT TIME. THE IN DOUBLE ACP ALLOW CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS SAID HE WAS MOVING [inaudible] TOO FAST HE WAS PUSHING THE AGENDA TOO FAST. WHILE THE OTHER SIDE THE PANTHERS IN THE IN IN THE MATHEMATICS OF THE WORLD WHICH SEEMS GOING TO SLOW. AND IT WASN'T FIERCE ENOUGH INFIGHTING ENOUGH. DO THE RIGHT THING. HISTORY HAS PROVED. THAT NONVIOLENCE WITH THE WAY TO GO AND I BELIEVE THAT HISTORY WILL SHOW DAY USING A RISK ASSESSMENT. SYSTEM WILL BE THE WAY TO GO ESPECIALLY. AND I SAY THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN SPECIALLY [inaudible] THIS BODY. PUTS THE ELBOW GREASE IT NEEDS TO ENSURE. THAT THAT SYSTEM OFFSETS THE JUDGES MADE TO ASSESS WHAT LAW MY FIRST* WILL DO BUT ULTIMATELY WILL ENSURE. I WILL SAY THIS AGAIN WILL ENSURE THE SAFETY. OF EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA. DISPEL DOES NOT SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH OUR PANEL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT IT BRINGS ECONOMIC JUSTICE TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM. WE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT MAY HAPPEN IF THIS BILL PASSES. BUT HERE'S ONE THING WE CAN ALL AGREE. THAT BILL WILL DEFINITELY. AND A LEGALIZED FORM OF ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION BY ELIMINATING CASH BAIL IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS A FIRST STEP. I LIKE EVERY BILL WE PASSED. IS THAT ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. SAY IT ALL THE TIME IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT LEGISLATION IT'S ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION IF YOU DON'T SEE IT BEFORE IT MEANS MORE SO RIGHT NOW DID ANYTHING WE'VE EVER DONE BEFORE ON THIS FLOOR. THAT WHEN WE COME BACK. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO HAVE TO HAVE LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A FOR TWO YEARS IS NOT SOME THAT CAME OUT OF LEFT FIELD. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT NOW AND WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT A TWO WEEK GET THE SYSTEM. THAT WE ULTIMATELY WANT. LOOK DOCTOR KING UNDERSTOOD. THAT WE CANNOT STAND BY AND LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. AND MOST IMPORTANT CONFUCIUS HAS SAID IS BETTER TO HAVE A DIAMOND WITH A FLAW. BEEN A PEBBLE WITHOUT. MEMBERS I WON A DIME. S. B. TEN PROVIDES US WITH THE FOUNDATION TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT WILL BE EQUITABLE AND PROVIDE JUSTICE FOR ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS SAID AFTER A MULTI YEAR DEBATE ON THE TOPIC I'M PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TOWN WHICH IF PASSED WOULD CREATE THE STRONG GUESS. THE MOST JUST. FAIREST PRE TRIAL SYSTEM OF ANY STATE. IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY. JUST AS WE'VE LED THE COUNTRY ON OTHER FRONTS AND STARTED NATIONAL POLICY DISCUSSIONS ON SUBJECTS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE CIVIL RIGHTS AND GUN CONTROL WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. TO LEAD ON THE ISSUE OF BAIL REFORM IS THE IS THE BILL PERFECT. I THINK VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY HERE AGREES FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THAT IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT THIS BILL HAS CHANGED SINCE I FIRST AGREED TO BE A CO AUTHOR. WITH THE SENATOR FROM VAN NUYS IN OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ALAMEDA AND DO I LIKE ALL THE CHANGES NO I I I I FRANKLY I DON'T. A BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT DEMOCRACY AS A GEORGE WILL WANT SAID IS THE POLITICS OF THE HALF LOAF -- AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE WE HAVE A COMPROMISE ON AN EXTREMELY COMPLICATED BUT IMPORTANT ISSUE IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF OUR SUPREME COURT. TO SPEAK OUT ON IT AND AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT OUR CHIEF JUSTICE SHE DOESN'T GET UP AND STAND UP ON JUST ANY ISSUE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR ALL OF US. AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS UNDER THIS BILL THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE CHARGED XIN BOOK FOR CRIME. WILL BE RELEASED AND A SOUTH STE UNDER A SYSTEM THAT IS MUCH FAIRER. THAT IS A RISK BASED SYSTEM NOT A MONEY BASED SYSTEM AND UNDER THIS BILL INNOCENT PEOPLE WILL NO LONGER BE FORCED INTO GUILTY PLEAS. TO GET BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR JOBS. NO I I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF THOSE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THIS BELT WE STRIKE AND TRYING ALONG WITH ALL OF YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEM. BUT VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY AS HAS BEEN SAID DOES NOT. PREVENT US FROM MAKING THINGS BETTER BUT NOT VOTING FOR THIS TODAY HAS CONSEQUENCES. AND THOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE THAT PEOPLE AND THESE ARE PRIMARILY LOW INCOME AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WILL CONTINUE TO BE VICTIMS. OF A SYSTEM THAT MOST OF US IN THE ROOM. ARE ACKNOWLEDGING IS A DISCRIMINATORY AND UNJUST SYSTEM AND THERE WILL BE LITTLE HOPE FOR CHANGE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MEAN THIS BILL HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS NOW THERE IS LOTS OF GROUP THINK AN INDIVIDUAL THINK INVOLVED IN WHAT. WE ARE DEBATING HERE TODAY AND ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO WILL BENEFIT. PLEASE LET'S REMEMBER. WHO WERE WORKING FOR AND WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP HERE? ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASED FAIRNESS THAT'S PROVIDED BY SB. TEN I RESPECTFULLY JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED SO. I HATE THIS PROCESS [inaudible] I HATE. HOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST. CHANGES AND ARE CURRENT JUSTICE SYSTEM [inaudible] AND DECADES. THROUGHOUT THE WAR PROCESS. I FEEL LIKE IT'S AN INSULT. TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US AS LEGISLATORS. THAT THIS LANGUAGE. IS BEING SPRUNG ON US TO THE LAST MINUTE. YOU I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS LANGUAGE [inaudible] FOR MONTHS. WHERE IS THE LANGUAGE WHERE THEY DETAILS? WE'RE WORKING ON IT SOME GROUP OUTSIDE THE BUILDING IS CALLING ME OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. TO SAY THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON IT. WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US? BUT I WAS DEFERRING. JUDICIAL COUNCIL I WAS DEFERRING. TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHILE SPOKE WITH THIS MORNING. AND I WAS READING WHAT I COULD OF THIS BILL. AND I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA THAT. WE DON'T DO SOMETHING. PEOPLE ARE GONNA CONTINUE TO SUFFER UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM SO [inaudible] IT SAID CRAPPIE PROCESS. BUT I FEEL THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. BECAUSE I KNOW. HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ACHIEVE CHANGE? I KNOW AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR. HOW PEOPLE ARE HELD BECAUSE THEY CAN'T [inaudible] AFFORD BAIL. I BELIEVE AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR THAT [inaudible] THIS WILL HELP. STRENGTHENED PUBLIC SAFETY IT WILL GIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO VICTIMS OF CRIME. TO TELL US FIND THESE PRE TRIAL ASSESSMENT HEARINGS. THE CRAPPY BILL AND IT'S GONNA NEED A LOT OF FIXES. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THOSE FIXES BUT I'M AFRAID THAT IF WE DON'T BUT ON THIS BILL NOW IT'S NOT GOING TO PASS ON TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES LIKE SO MANY OF YOU KNOW I RISE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH. ALWAYS WITH SOME CONCERNS BECAUSE IT IS A MAJOR STEP FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE CONCEPT OF BAIL. WAS WHEN I WAS A KID. AND MY FATHER GOT A CALL TO HELP BAIL SOMEBODY OUT OF JAIL. THEN THE WHAT THE HECK THAT WAS. BUT HE'D NEVER JOEY DIDN'T BILL A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL. WE HAD A PERSON WHO HAD GOTTEN INTO JAIL BECAUSE I DON'T NO THEY WERE GAMBLING OR SOMETHING THAT ONE OF THE GAMBLING PARTIES IN THE PLEASE USE TO RAID THE PLACE TO TAKE THESE FOLKS JAIL. MY FATHER HAD TO A DECIDED TO GIVE TO THIS BRAILLE FUND FOR THIS PERSON HE SAID BECAUSE YOU KNOW. IF HE DOESN'T GET OUT OF JAIL THIS WEEKEND HE WON'T HAVE A JOB ON MONDAY WHEN BOTH MISTER CHARLIE. HE'LL LOSE HIS JOB. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF UNUSUAL BECAUSE THAT UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE TIME AS A KID. BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF POVERTY. BUT IF YOU ARE GENERALLY IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE THESE JOBS THAT ARE KIND OF LOW WAGE JOBS WOULD ALSO JOBS WITHOUT A LOT OF BENEFITS. IT YOU THEN BECOME THE VICTIM OF A HOST OF THINGS. AND ONE OF THOSE IS A BRAILLE SYSTEM. AND SO MY DAD WOULD ALWAYS SAY I DON'T BILL EVERYBODY OUT OF JAIL BUT IF YOU HAVE A JOB I'M GOING TO BAIL YOU OUT OF JAIL THIS IS A POOR MAN TALKING. ABOUT GIVING TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FORTY FIFTY DOLLARS TO BAIL SYSTEM. BECAUSE HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PERSON HAD A JOB ONE MONDAY MORNING. AND SO WHEN I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND EVEN LATER. AND EVEN NOW THE LEGISLATIVE WE LOOK AT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OUR SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. AND ALL OF THE JUDGES AROUND THE STATE WILL CONSERVATIVE AS WELL AS SOME LIBERAL ONES. THE CONCERN WAS ALWAYS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS SYSTEM WAS SO OFTEN FEAR. AND SO ON JUST TO POOR PEOPLE. WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS TO BAIL FOLKS OUT OF JAIL WHO DIDN'T HAVE CREDIT CARDS TO GET PEOPLE OUT? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WANT TO BAIL SOMEONE OUT THAT MONEY IS GONE. YOU DO NOT GET IT BACK. BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PAID THE FULL AMOUNT OF ONLY PAY 10%. AND THAT 10% IS GONE TO SOMEONE ELSE WHY BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A SITUATION THAT YOU WEREN'T HURTING SOMEONE YOU WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN YOU NORMALLY DO MAYBE. WHAT YOU END UP IN JAIL AND YOU NEEDED THE BILL YOURSELF OUT? THIS IS NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM AND I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL. GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. BECAUSE UNLIKE WHAT SOME OF YOU SAID THIS IS GOING TO GIVE MORE POWER TO OUR JUDGES. ACTUALLY MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHO GETS THAT WHO WHO GETS OUT OF JAIL. AND SO THIS POSITION THAT IT'S NICE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE JUDGES THIS IS ACTUALLY GIVING MORE. AND THE SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS LIKE THE IN DOUBLE ACP IN A CEO YOUR CONCERN. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT I JUDGE SYSTEM A JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS NOT THAT PERFECT. AND THERE'S STILL TREMENDOUS BIAS IN OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S AND HOW THEY CHARGE POOR PEOPLE FOR HIGHER CRIMES. AND IS STILL BIAS IN OUR JUDGES WHO LOOK AT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PEOPLE PORT DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY DO OTHERS. AND AS A RESULT THERE MAY BE SOME BIAS. IT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL IS THE FUNCTIONS THE WAY WE WANT IT TO FUNCTION. BUT I'VE LEARNED THAT. ALL ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE. THAT CHANGES FAR. IT IS DIFFICULT. AND OFTEN TIMES OUT OF OUR FEAR OF CHANGE THAT WE DO NOTHING. WE JUST STAND STILL. AND WE FIND EVERY REASON NOT TO CHANGE. AND THINGS DON'T GET BETTER. THEY GET WORSE. AND REQUIRE SOME TIME SOME COURAGE TO STEP FORWARD. TO NOT ONLY MAKE THE CHANGE WOULD WORK TO MAKE THAT CHANGE WORK RIGHT. I CAN REMEMBER WHEN BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR'S DECISION WAS DONE. PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED THAT THIS WAS MOVING TOO FAST AND WE NEEDED TO SLOW DOWN. AND YOU LEARN VERY QUICKLY THAT THIS WAS REALLY A SMALL STEP IN THE INTEGRATION. IT WASN'T THE BE ALL END ALL. AND IT REQUIRED LOTS OF WORK AFTERWARDS AND STILL TO THIS DAY IT IS NOT THE PERFECT SYSTEM THAT WE WANT. AND WHEN I LOOK AT ALL THOSE THINGS WE'VE DONE IN THIS HOUSE AND FOR THE LAST FIFTY SIXTY YEARS OF IT IN LAW ISSUE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. WE'VE HAD SMALL STEPS TINY STEPS SOMETIMES FOR STEP FORWARD TWO STEPS BACK. STILL MOVING FORWARD. WILL YOU AN IMPERFECT WORLD THIS IN AN IMPERFECT SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS BUT IT REQUIRES US TO HAVE SOME FAITH. SOME COURAGE THAT WHEN WE FIND SOMETHING WRONG. AND THERE'S NOT A PERSON ON THIS FLOOR WHO SAID MONEY BAIL IS A GOOD THING. WE ALL SAID IT IS WRONG. MOST OF US HAVE DONE NOTHING TO CHANGE IT THOUGH. WE HAVE NOT ORGANIZE WE HAVE NOT PUT FORTH FORTH A BILL WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY MOVED TO BAKE BUDDY BILL. I TAKE BUT A BILL OUT OF CALIFORNIA. SO NOW WE HAVE SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE. AND THEY SPENT TWO YEARS SO ANYONE WHO SAYS THIS JUST POPPED UP NO MAYBE THE CONCEPT OF WAR POPPED UP. BUT REMEMBER WE HAVE A LOT OF THIS THERE'S SOMETHING AS BEING PREFACE EVERY TWO HOURS AND WE'VE DONE THAT THEY'VE DONE THAT. AND SO YOU HAD ITS BENEFITS SEVENTY TWO HOURS USE IT IF YOU WANTED TO SEE IT IT'S BEEN HERE. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY FOLKS HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE AFRAID. THE NO LONGER THAN BE PARALYZED BY FEAR. ACTUALLY TRY TO MOVE FORWARD TO BRING SOME CHANGE BECAUSE EVERYONE ON THIS FLOOR HAS SAID MONEY BAIL IS WRONG. IT IS NOT A GOOD SYSTEM IT IS NOT A SYSTEM THAT KEEPS US SAFE AND IS SURELY IS UNFAIR AND UNJUST TO THOSE WHO PROBABLY NEED JUSTICE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. I HOPE YOU WILL. STRAIGHT NEAR BACK. LOOK TOWARD THE SUN. DO WHAT IS RIGHT WHAT IS JUST AND THAT IT MOVES CALIFORNIA IN A POSITION THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD BEFORE. AND THAT YOU WILL BASICALLY VOTE YES FOR S. B. TM. AND IF YOU CANNOT FIND YOURSELF WANTING TO VOTE FOR IT AND IT PASSES. BUT YOU WILL WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT S. B. TIN WORKS IN CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK ME I BOTH S. B.. TEN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MENTAL SPEAKER MEMBERS I'M JUST. I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M HEARING. ON THE FLOOR TODAY I MEAN. ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO'S GOTTEN UP TO TELL US TO BOW IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. HAS ESSENTIALLY MADE THIS ARGUMENT -- YEAH THIS COULD BE REALLY BAD. BUT IT'S BETTER THAN THE STATUS QUO. TO PASS BAD POLICY IN HEY WE COULD MAYBE FIX THAT BAD POLICY. DOWN THE ROAD WHY DON'T WE JUST DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. THE FIRST TIME. AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT EVERYBODY'S MAKING. ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE WHY DIDN'T WHY. WHY DO WE NEED TO WORK THIS TO THE BILL TO THE TO THE FLOOR? MENDOZA YOU ARE MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS BAD -- THIS IS BAD PROCESS. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT YOU COULDN'T REJECT. THIS CONTINUAL POLITICS LEGISLATIVE POLITICS OF FAST FORWARDING LEGISLATION TO THE FLOOR THAT NOBODY'S HAVE THE TIME. TO REALLY DEVOID TO READ. THAT NO COMMITTEES HAVE REALLY HAD THE PROCESS TO DELIBERATE AND DISCUSS. AND THEN EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS THAT LIKE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET GOOD POLICY OUT OF IT. YOU'RE NOT THAT IS CRAZY IS THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY. TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THIS WAY. AND MANY OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD ON THIS FLOOR JUST PURE FANTASY. LIKE THAT WE'VE BEEN DEBATING THIS ARE YOU KIDDING ME. THE LAST TIME WE HAD A DEBATE ON THIS WAS LAST YEAR ON THE FLOOR AGAIN AT THE VERY. END THE SESSION. TRIED TO PUT SOME THROUGH WE DIDN'T GET. LUCKILY. THIS BODY SAID NO THE TIME IS NOT RIGHT WE HAVE A DISCUSSES. AND NOW A YEAR LATER. AGAIN THE VERY END THE SESSION WE HAD A BILL THAT. HAD LANGUAGE IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. AS LATE AS LAST THURSDAY. LAST THURSDAY WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BILL. THAT DAY LANGUAGE CHANGE WE STILL GOING GET LANGUAGE SO OVER THE WEEKEND. AND NOW IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BILL. AND WE'RE TOLD YEAH GO AHEAD AND BONES AND APPROVE THE SAYING IN AND LET'S MOVE FORWARD. THAT'S NOT A GOOD WAY. TO MAKE GOOD POLICY NOW FROM WHAT I CAN. HAVE READ THE BILL THERE'S THERE'S A MAJOR PROBLEMS HERE EVERYBODY DOES AGREE. THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS FLAWED THERE'S INEQUITIES. BUT WHAT THE OP USER THING THE OPPOSITION DOESN'T DISAGREE. THE OPPOSITION ACTUALLY AGREES ON THIS POINT THIS WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO ACTUALLY MORE DETENTIONS. NO PRIOR ACTUALLY TO MORE DETENTIONS AND WHEN YOU DO RISK BASE. ASSESSMENTS IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DO THAT CRITERIA AND YOU'RE GIVING THAT AWAY. TO ANOTHER BODY NOT THIS BODY. THEY'RE GONNA DETERMINE WHAT THAT RISK ASSESSMENT IS AND DEPENDING ON HOW THEY DO IT THOSE INEQUITIES THAT YOU'VE SEEN ACTUALLY COULD BE EXACERBATED. SO FOR THOSE OF YOU ARE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE INEQUITIES WE'RE GOING TO STOP UNFAIR DETENTION. YOU MAY DO VERY VERY THE OPPOSITE WITH THIS AND YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER IT BECAUSE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS GOING TO COME OF THAT CRITERIA NOT YOU. AND SO YOU SHOULD REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT THE OTHER THING YOU'RE YOU ARE ELIMINATING. AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK MAYBE IT'S WORTH. AT LEAST MORE THAN A COUPLE DAYS TO FIGURE OUT IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA OR NOT [inaudible] RIGHT. NOW THERE MAY THERE ARE FLAWS IN THE BILL SYSTEM BUT ONE THING IT DOESN'T SURE IS IT IT CREATES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. FOR SOMEONE TO ENSURE THAT SOMEONE SHOWS BACK UP TO COURT. WHICH IS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO TO ENSURE RIGHT. IT ALSO WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP AS WELL THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. AS PROVISIONS OF THE PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO BAIL. IN THAT ONLY UNDER VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES CAN YOU BE DENIED. CAN YOU BE DENIED THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE CREATING A SYSTEM THAT HAS A WHOLE LOT OF EXEMPTIONS. TO THAT IT MAY VERY WELL BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT WHY TAKE THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT. REALLY TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION. THIS IS FLAWED POLICY LIKE PLEASE I MEAN. I MAKE THIS ADMONITION A LOT I KNOW. BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF US WORKING TOGETHER IN THIS BY US FOR OVER ELECTED SO THAT WE CAN DEBATE THIS THING SO WE CAN. DEVOTED SO IF YOU GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY DETAILS AND HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH A BETTER POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT WE HAVE BEEN DEBATING IT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT. WE'VE JUST SEEN THIS LANGUAGE AND NOW YOU'RE PASSING SOMETHING IF YOU SAY OH WELL WILL PASS SOMETHING REALLY BAD SO THAT WE CAN CHANGE IT LATER. THAT'S A DERELICTION YOUR DUTY. THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE. SO PLEASE I WOULD JUST. URGE MY COLLEAGUES LET'S REJECT THIS POLLOCK WAS REJECT THIS TYPE OF POLITICS. COME BACK AND REALLY WORK ON THIS WE CAN MAKE WE CAN REFORM THE BILL SYSTEM TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER FOR EVERYBODY. BUT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT HIRED YOU KNOW THE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COM LOCKER TO OF YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I AM. I AM NOT HAPPY. MY CONSTITUENTS ARE NOT HAPPY. MANY OF US WENT HOME OVER THE WEEKEND. TO TRY AND VISIT THE FOLKS IN OUR DISTRICT AND SPEND TIME WITH OUR FAMILIES. AND THE WHOLE WEEKEND. I SPENT THINKING ABOUT THIS BILL. AND HEARING FROM FOLKS ABOUT THIS BILL. AND IT DOES HAVE MY STOMACH IN A NOT. I ALSO WANT TO JUST BE CLEAR. THE LA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS NOT THE END ALL BE ALL FOR ME. WHEN IT COMES TO GOOD CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY? THERE IS A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IN LA COUNTY. AND IF THIS BILL PASSES WE ALL COLLECTIVELY. HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION. TO WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND THIS ISSUE AND NOT LET IT GO BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE SILVER BULLET. I BELIEVE NO BILL WE PASSED. IS A SILVER BULLET. SO MAYBE SOME DAYS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR BRONZE OR COPPER. OR EVEN SOME WOULD [inaudible] PROBATION. DA'S OFFICE SAYS JUDGES. IMPLICIT BIAS IN THOSE SYSTEMS. LET'S BE CLEAR. RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS PREVENTIVE DETENTION REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TRACKING AND TRANSPARENCY LET'S BE CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY IS CLEAN KEY TRACKING IS KEY. BUT OUR OWNING THIS ISSUE ITS PROCESS AND ITS SUCCESS IS ALSO KEY. AND WE DECIDED TO DO IT. WHEN WE? THIS BILL. CASH RULES EVERYTHING AROUND ME. CASH RULES EVERYTHING AROUND US. THE BAIL SYSTEM. OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM OUR-PROBATION SYSTEM. THOSE ALL GENERATE REVENUE BECAUSE SPOKES GO BEFORE PEOPLE. LOOKING FOR FREEDOM OR DUE PROCESS. BUT STRAPPING PEOPLE'S LIBERTY AND FUTURE. TO BAIL MONEY. IS JUST WRONG. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE. LOOK LIKE SO MANY FOLKS WHO ARE REPEATEDLY THROWN UNDER THE BUS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. I'M GOING TO VOTE ON PRINCIPLE. ON THIS BILL [inaudible] WE HAVE [inaudible] AN OBLIGATION. TO FIND WAYS TO FIX THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE BROKEN. WE HAVE POWER. THAT NOT MANY OTHERS HALF IN FACT ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OF US. AND FAILURE ONLY COMES. WHEN WE DO NOTHING? AND IF I TELL MY LITTLE PEOPLE. IN MY HOUSEHOLD [inaudible] TO TRY. AND IF YOU FAIL GET UP AND DO IT AGAIN. BECAUSE THAT PROCESS AND FINDING SUCCESS AND WORKING MUSCLES THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE. IS IMPORTANT. THEN I CERTAINLY BELIEVE I HAVE TO TAKE MY OWN COUNSEL. TODAY. I WILL BE SIGNING UP. TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE WORK THIS OUT. IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT. AND I WOULD URGE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME WITH ME THINK. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER THANK YOU MEMBERS. A IN THE MILITARY WE HAVE A SAYING [inaudible] SLOW SMOOTH. SMOOTH AS FAST. WE NEED TO SLOW THIS DOWN. BECAUSE ALL I'VE HEARD TODAY. FROM MANY OF YOU IS THAT. THIS IS ALL PUT TOGETHER. THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS. YOU DON'T FOR SH. SOMETHING BAD IN THE EFFORT TO DO SOMETHING GOOD. ESPECIALLY NOT IN COMBAT THAT'S HOW YOU END UP WITH PEOPLE DEAD. BUT YET HERE WE ARE. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THE EIGHTY IN THE ASSEMBLY [inaudible] FOR SEEN SOMETHING WE KNOW. THAT IS NOT GOOD. IT'S BEEN SAID IS NOT FULLY. COOKED IT'S NOT FULLY BAKED. IT'S BEEN CALLED APPEAL LESS. THIS BILL IS GARBAGE. AND YOU ALL KNOW IT. IT'S GOING TO COMPLETELY AFFECT THE LIVES OF EVERYBODY. THAT SENT US UP HERE TO REPRESENT THEM. IT'S GOING TO AFFECT OUR FAMILIES [inaudible] OUR NEIGHBORS. WE HAVE MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT OTHER AFRAID TO LEAVE. THEIR WIVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. AT HOME. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHO'S GONNA BE LET OUT ON THE STREET. WHERE D. SUFFERING FROM PROP FORTY SEVEN PROP FIFTY SEVEN THESE OTHER THINGS [inaudible] BUT YET. WE WANT TO SPEED IT UP. WE WANT TO PUSH THIS FORWARD WE'VE GOTTA MAKE A CHANGE. A CHANGE FROM WHAT. YOU ALL TOOK AN OATH YOU TOOK AN OBLIGATION. FOR THOSE A SAY THEY'RE SICK OF IT STOP RUNNING FOR OFFICE [inaudible] I'M NOT. WELL NOT AFRAID TO STAND APPARENTLY A SLOWDOWN. GET IT RIGHT. GET IT RIGHT FOR YOUR KIDS FOR YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FOR THEIR KIDS. YEAH OTHERS BIAS OUT THERE YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE'S VICE AND EVERYTHING SOME OF US LIKE SPICY SOME OF US LIKE HOT SUMMER. ADVICE AND EVERYTHING. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. IF WE DON'T SLOW DOWN IF WE DON'T COME BACK TOGETHER WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION [inaudible] AS LEGISLATURE'S. ON WHAT THE RIGHT PATH FORWARD FOR THIS BROKEN SYSTEM IS. THEN WE'RE DOING A DISSERVICE. IT'LL BE ON EVERYBODY THE VOTES I ON THIS. WHEN THIS GETS MESSED UP? BECAUSE THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER SYSTEM WHERE? IS THE MEMBERS THE GOAL OF QUITE FRANKLY I'D CALL YOU CAL WORDS BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING AWAY YOUR POWER. AS LEGISLATURE'S TO SOMEBODY ELSE. SO IF YOU WANT TO HOLD ON ABOUT POWER KEEP IT LET'S COME BACK WITH GET THIS RIGHT. SO YOU CAN SAY WE DID OUR JOBS. IS THAT A PASS IN THE BLOCK INSTEAD OF SPEEDING IT UP AND GIVEN AWAY YOUR POWER TO SOMEBODY ELSE SO MANY COULD TURN AROUND AND PUT YOUR FINGER AGO. ALL WE WE PASSED IT. BUT BUT WE GIVE THE POWER TO THEM SO NOW IT'S THEIR FAULT. OWN UP TO YOUR JOB VOTE NO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT. TO MAKE HUMAN LIFE THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE. BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. AND SOMETHING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPACTING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS OUR STATE LET'S TALK ABOUT. RACIAL DISPARITIES IN BAIL. THE FACT THAT. FOR LATINO MEN. IT'S 19% AND FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN IT'S 35% HIGHER. THAT OF THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. LET'S PUT SOME REAL CONTEXT INTO THIS SOME. EXAMPLES IN THE REAL WORLD. JUST LAST YEAR A MAN NAMED KENNETH HUMPHRIES -- SPEND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS. IN JAIL. ON THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BAIL FOR STEALING FIVE DOLLARS. AND A BOTTLE OF COLOGNE. A STATE APPEAL A STATE APPEALS ORDER ORDERED THE NEW BAIL HEARING BECAUSE THEY AGREED THAT A DEFENDANT MAY NOT BE IMPRISONED. SOLELY BASED ON POVERTY SECOND EXAMPLE. A GUNMAN AND TO HIM A COUNTY NAMED KEVIN MEAL. WHEN OUT ON BAIL? AFTER STABBING A NEIGHBOR AFTER KILLING FIVE PEOPLE INCLUDING HIS WIFE. HE WAS A DANGER TO HIS COMMUNITY. AND HE WAS RELEASED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE MADE BAIL. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT SAFETY AND COMMUNITY AND WHAT THAT ALL MEANS. THOSE ARE TWO REAL WORLD EXAMPLES. OF HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS. CASH BAIL IS ABOUT WHETHER YOU CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT. AND WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY IS DIFFERENT. WE ARE ENSURING. THAT OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS. IN THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT ROTTING AWAY IN JAIL. BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR. AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD CASH BAIL. THAT WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING AN HONEST LIVING PERHAPS WORKING TWO TO THREE JOBS. TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND WHO UNFORTUNATELY GET UP GET CAUGHT UP IN THE SYSTEM. HAVE AN EQUAL AND FAIR SYSTEM THAT REPRESENTS THEM BASED ON JUSTICE. NOT ON THE PREMISE. WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD TO MAKE CASH BAIL? THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. HOW THIS BILL IS IN? AND KNOW NOTHING IS EVER PERFECT. THERE IS THE REAL WORLD IN WHICH ME LIVIN IN WHICH WE LEGISLATIVE. AND THEN THERE'S THE IDEAL WORLD IN WHICH WE ALL HOPED WE LIVED AND HOPEFULLY STEP BY STEP. WE GET THERE. BUT IT TAKES TIME IT TAKES COURAGE AND I'M SO. I'M SO AND I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT SO MANY REPUBLICAN MEMBERS SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO WORK ON THIS IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE IF THIS MAKES IT OUT INTO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND GET FINE INTO LAW I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PUT TOGETHER A COMMITTEE WITH. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO FIX THE SYSTEM. I THINK THAT'S IMPRESSIVE AN INSPIRATIONAL IN THE CONVERSATION THAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY. SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOPE IN WHAT THAT MEANS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT PUT. PRICE ON FREEDOM. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PIVOT. I CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE STATE TO BE A BEACON OF HOPE. FOR THE REST OF THE NATION. THEN NONE OF THIS IS EASY IT TAKES COURAGE AS IT WAS STATED. BY MEMBERS BEFORE ME THAT SPOKE. WE CAME HERE. NOT BECAUSE THIS IS A TOUGH IS EASY OR BECAUSE CASTING VOTES LIKE THIS IS EASY. BUT BECAUSE IT AND IT IS IN FACT QUITE HARD. IT IS CHALLENGING. AND IT TAKES COURAGE WHETHER IT'S LITTLE BY LITTLE STEP BY STEP TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY. REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE WHO DESERVE JUSTICE. WHO DESERVE TO BE ABLE? TO NOT ROT IN PRISON BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR. WE TALK ABOUT POVERTY THE TALK ABOUT JOBS. WE TALK ABOUT WHAT HELPING THE WORKING WORKING CLASS WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THAT. HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF OUR STATE CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS NATION. AND WHILE THIS BILL S. B. TAME MEN MAY NOT BE PERFECT. IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IN THE FUTURE. MAYBE A FEW YEARS FROM NOW A DECADE FROM NOW. PEOPLE WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT WHO OPPOSED TO WAS IN SUPPORT. THEY'RE GONNA BE ASKING WHO HAD THE COURAGE. I DO SOMETHING WHEN NOBODY ELSE WOULD. WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE TOWARDS JUSTICE? I HAVE THAT COURAGE. AND I KNOW A LOT OF YOU DO AS WELL. SO REGARDLESS OF WHO SUPPORT THEM WHO OPPOSES OR WHERE YOU ARE TODAY FIND THE COURAGE WITHIN YOURSELF TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AYE VOTE ON SB TEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER [inaudible] THINK HIM [inaudible] I AM. ONLY ONE TO SPEAK. WHY PRIMARILY ONE SPEAK TO THE PROCESS ISSUE -- I PEOPLE AT HOME WHO ARE WATCHING THIS DOING THE PLAY BY PLAY BY TAX TIME WHICH ARGUMENT THEY FIND OF ALL THE YEARS THAT SOUNDS GOOD OR BAD -- IN IN THAT I SO YEAH THAT SOUNDS GOOD BUT THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE. THIS IS NOT BEING HURRIED. THIS BILL GRANTED IN DIFFERENT FORMS AS BILLS OFTEN TAKE. HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS [inaudible] CAN SIMPLY. I DON'T NO FLY SAID ON THE WRONG COMMITTEES BUT I THINK I'VE HEARD THIS IN COMMITTEE HEARD IT ON THE FLOOR. THIS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE SUDDENLY CAME UP WITH AND I REMEMBER STANDING UP ON THE FLOOR LAST YEAR. FOR THE ASSEMBLY BILL THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND BROUGHT IN HEARING PEOPLE SAY WELL WHY ARE WE RUSHING AT CAN'T WE JUST WAIT FOR THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO PUT OUT HER RECOMMENDATION. WELL SHE DID THAT. AND THEY WERE LISTEN. TO AND THEY WERE USED TO COLLABORATE. AND I HEARD PEOPLE STAND UP SOME THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE STANDING UP TODAY OPPOSING THOSE SAYING THEY KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG BUT THIS WASN'T THE FIX AND WE'VE HEARD NOTHING FROM THEM. THIS PAST YEAR IN LOOKING FOR AFFECTS. AND YET STILL IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. PEOPLE ARE PICKED UP FOR THINGS THAT THEY DIDN'T DO. THEY HAVE TO POST A BILL IN ORDER TO GO TO WORK. AND THAT MONEY IS KEPT FROM THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NEVER CHARGED. PEOPLE WHO ARE FOUND INNOCENT WHO SHOW UP TO COURT. THEY LOSE THAT 10%. IN A COMMUNITY LIKE MINE. WHERE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD BE YOUR FAMILY'S ENTIRE SAVINGS? WE KNOW THAT THE CASH BAIL SYSTEM IS BROKEN. AND I'LL SAY WHAT I SAID LAST YEAR A THEFT ON POOR PEOPLE. WE KNOW THAT. TO SUGGEST SOMEHOW THAT WE'RE PUTTING OURSELVES IN MORE DANGER. IS INCREDIBLE TO ME AND I KEEP HEARING THIS AS IF PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD PAY ALL. RICH PEOPLE WHO ARE LET OUT. I THINK LAST YEAR THERE WAS A POST OF A BILL FOR THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO SUGGEST THAT THAT WOMAN IS ANY [inaudible] LESS LIKELY. TO RE OFFEND. BECAUSE SHE HAS MONEY. OR TO SUGGEST THAT. THE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF SEX OFFENDERS [inaudible] RAPIST [inaudible] MURDERERS. WHO ARE LED OUT BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY HAVE MONEY? SOMEHOW MAKE US SAFER BY KEEPING THAT SYSTEM. IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE MISTAKES IN THE SYSTEM. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CAN GET THE EXACT NUMBER WHO ARE LET OUT ON BAIL NOW. FOR LET OUT AFTER PAIN THEIR BAIL WHO RE OFFEND. THERE WILL BE SOME PEOPLE. WHO ARE LET OUT UNDER THIS RISK ASSESSMENT STUDY? WHO OUR SITUATION WHO WILL FUND? BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO CORRECT A SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE ALL SAID NOW ON THIS FLOOR IS BROKEN. AND TO MY FRIENDS. ON THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE AT THE ACLU. AND ARE ACTIVISTS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO SAY THIS DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. I AGREE AND I AGREE BOMB. WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WHO SAID WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTINUE TO WRAP HER ARMS AROUND THIS AND MAKE IT BETTER. BUT HAVING STEP THROUGH THIS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IF WE DON'T PASS THIS NOW. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A BILL TO BE BROUGHT BACK NEXT YEAR. OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT. THERE JUST ISN'T SIMPLY. THE WILL TO START FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY WILL SIT HERE TODAY AND SAY THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD WORK ON 90% OF THE PEOPLE STANDING UP AND SAYING THAT HAVE DONE NOTHING. TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. OR TO MAKE THIS ISSUE BETTER. THAT'S THE TRUTH. BECAUSE MOST OF US AREN'T AFFECTED DIRECTLY BY THE US. AND SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE DIRECTED DIRECTLY OFFENDED I'VE S.. SO THOSE OF US WHO CARE DEEPLY BUT CARE DEEPLY WHAT ARE ACTIVISTS THINK AS MUCH AS KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. NO THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP. IT'S A SOLID FIRST STEP. TO GET US TO A POSITION WHERE WE CAN WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND IT. WHERE WE CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO WORK? TOWARDS AS MY FORMER SEAT MAKING COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAID AND I I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD SAY IT BETTER. TOWARDS JUSTICE. THAT'S WHAT WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO. THIS IS BEEN A LONG TWO YEARS WE HAVE DEBATED THIS IN COMMITTEE AFTER COMMITTEE AFTER COMMITTEE. WE'VE DEBATED ON THE FLOOR IT'S BEEN DEBATED IN THE SENATE IT'S BEEN DEBATED IN THE MEDIA IT'S BEEN DEBATED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND BY OUR CHIEF JUSTICE. THIS IS NOT NEW TO ANYBODY OR SHOULDN'T BE NUDE ANYBODY HERE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE VOTE I TODAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. COOLEY YOUR RECOGNIZE SORRY NOT. SO MEMBER ALLEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANKS PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN ADVANCED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS ARREST RATES ARE DOWN. CATCH RELEASE RATES ARE UP AND NOW VIOLENT CRIME IS RISING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GETTING RID OF OUR CURRENT MAIL SYSTEM ONLY MAKE CALIFORNIA LESS SAFE. BY ELIMINATING BAIL CRIMINALS WILL STOP SHOWING UP FOR TRIAL. BY STRIPPING BAIL BONDSMAN OF THEIR POWER TO BRING CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE. MORE CRIMINALS WILL NOW ROAM FREE. HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH. NOTES IN THEIR RECENT LETTER. THIS THE CHEN SETS OF A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS JUDGES NEARLY UNLIMITED DISCRETION ORDER PEOPLE ACCUSED OF CRIMES BUT NOT CONVICTED AND PRESUMPTIVELY INNOCENT TO BE HELD IN JAIL WITH NO RECOURSE. IN TWO OTHER CASES RESOLVE. AND FURTHERMORE THE DETENTION HEARING PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED BY S. B. TEN VIOLATE DUE PROCESS AND ARE SO LOOSE THE EMPOWER JUDGES TO PREVENT DIGITALLY DETAINED AT WILL. S. B. TEN WILL MAKE US SAFER. IT WILL LEAD EVEN HIGHER CRIME RATES. IT WILL LEAD TO EVEN MORE CRIMINALS LOOSE ON OUR STREETS. AND WILL LEAD TO INNOCENT PEOPLE BEING HELD IN JAIL AGAINST THEIR WILL AND WITHOUT DUE PROCESS AT THE MERCY OF MANIPULATED COMPUTER ALGORITHMS. AN UNELECTED BUREAUCRACIES. AS WE GET IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT ENDANGERS EVERY CALIFORNIAN AND IT LEFT DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR CALIFORNIA. DON'T LET THE SAME POLITICIANS YOU GAVE US PROP FORTY SEVEN RUIN THE BAIL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. VOTE NO ON S. B.. TEN EACH YEAR MEMBER COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. NUMBER ONE THIS FIRST CAME OUT. SUPPORTED BILL REFORM AND THAT WITH THE AUTHOR MISTER BUT IT IT CINNAMON FROM ALAMEDA. AT THIS MOMENT FROM LOS ANGELES AND THE AG ON THIS ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT IT. IT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE THE JUDGES. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A MAJOR PART A PROBLEM TO GO BACK ON BILL. YOU'RE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN EACH COUNTY A PANEL OF JUDGES SETS THE BILL EVERY TWO YEARS. EVERY TWO YEARS SELLING CALIFORNIA OFF OF TOUCH OF ROBBERY IN ONE COUNTY BILL IS TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT WAS ALWAYS A TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ANOTHER COUNTY ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN. JUDGES THAT THE BILL IS p200-082-0009 WE DOUBLED THE BILLS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE JUDGES. THIS IS MY GIVEN THE FOX ACCUSING HIM HOUSE NOW JUST A COUNCIL GETS TO DO THIS AND ORGANIZE THIS. SO ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES SITTING FIFTY DIFFERENT STANDARDS THERE'S ONLY ONE BILL ONE STANDARD THAT'S WITH THE BIG ISSUE WITH THIS AND YOU WILL STILL HAVE THE HUMAN FACTOR JUDGES. MAKING DECISIONS THAT THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. IT'S LIKE REFORM FATIGUE WE HAD PROP FORTY SEVEN PROP FIFTY SEVEN AB ONE I JUST VOTED ON EIGHTEEN TEN IN A TRAILER BILL. IT IS REFER IT IS A SIX FOOT FATIGUE. I DON'T THINK MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON OFFERED FOR BEING OF ALL THIS AND IN HELPING TO TRY AND MAKE IT BETTER -- THE COST CLUSTER ENORMOUS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO START OFF WITH WITHIN TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR IT IS WAY MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT. EVERYONE AT YOUR HOME ATTENTION ANKLE BRACELET THAT'S PAID FOR THE MONEY TO SYSTEM THAT'S PAID FOR SOME OF THE MODERATE THAT'S PAID FOR SOMEONE TO GO OUT WHEN YOU CUT OFF IN LEAF IN FTA. THAT'S PAID FOR TO LEARN MILLION IS A BIG ISSUE IT'S ALL GONNA COST WAY MORE THAN THAT. IT WE TALK TO THE TO THE PROPONENTS THE BILL THEY HAVE NO IDEA. IT IS REALLY JUST A WILD GUESS IN DEALING WITH THAT. WE WOULD BLOCK TURNER CASE A JUDGE MADE A BAD DECISIONS YOU GONNA HAVE THAT NEVER TAKE AWAY THE HUMAN FACTOR. AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO MORE FOLKS IN JAIL TO BE HONEST. THIS GONNA PUT MORE FOLKS IN JAIL WITH THAT. NOW IF THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE IS GONNA HAPPEN GONNA COME BACK TO FIX THIS AND YEAH WE HEARD A BILL YEAR AGO BUT NOTHING'S HAPPENED. IT'S HAPPENED THIS HOUSE THERE'S BEEN THE HEARINGS IN THIS HOUSE ON THE ISSUE. AND IT HASN'T INVENTED THERE THERE'S NOT URGENCY TO DO IT RIGHT TO HAVE A UNIFORM DEL SCHEDULE. TALK ABOUT FDA'S A LOT OF FOLKS JUST DON'T SHOW UP FOR COURT. SO IN SECOND A COUNTY CURRENTLY IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH DOES ANYONE CAN GO ON WITH A BILL NAY OR A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE. THE GILLS FOUR BLOCKS AWAY HOLES. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED INMATES THAT'S THE MAX FOR PRE TRIAL INMATES THE BOOK FIFTY THOUSAND PRISONERS IN THE YEAR FIFTY THOUSAND THE VAST MAJORITY GOING ANGLED OUT LITTLE STATE. ONCE ESTATE AVERAGE FIVE FOR THE CONVICTIONS SO ALSO DRUNK DRIVING AFFECT INSTANT IN JAIL. WILL BE YES OF THE GEL COMMANDER READY FOR TWO YEARS AND THEY'VE A PRE TRIAL PROGRAM THERE. SO NO I'M TALKING ABOUT ON THAT. SO PEOPLE HAVE TO SHOW UP LEN ORANGE COUNTY THINK IT'S FIVE AND SEVEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. NONE THE FTA PART GO THE DOCTOR BILL DENTIST HATE HIS REPLACEMENT CARD SHOW UP FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT. A LOT OF FOLKS JUST DON'T DO THAT AND THAT'S BEEN HONEST. RIVERSIDE COUNTY A QUARTER OF A MILLION OUTSTANDING WARRANTS. ZAMBRANO COUNTY A QUARTER MILLION OUTSTANDING WARRANTS LA COUNTY TWO POINT ONE MILLION OUTSTANDING WARRANTS. PEOPLE SHOW UP AND THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL FACT GUSTING RESPONSIBILITY A SHORT FOR YOUR COURT DATE. AND A LOT OF FOLKS JUST DON'T DO THAT. IF YOU NEED TO FIX THIS RIGHT AWAY FIX THAT. NO IT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO FIX IT LET'S DO IT RIGHT AND BE THOUGHTFUL WITH IT SO JUST JAM IT THROUGH. GO BACK EIGHTEEN TEN WE'LL FIX THAT NOW. NO WONDER KING GONNA FIX IT. SO I'M AT SOME POINT YOU GOTTA STOP. YOU KNOW YOU KEEP HEARING ABOUT. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO FIX THE THINGS WE'VE DONE SOME GOOD FIXES FOR OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. BUT WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THE VICTIM'S MOST OF US ARE VICTIMS IN HERE WE DON'T IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE BEING AFFECTED. GONZALEZ FLETCHER GO BACK THE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE SAME CRIME AFFECTING THE SAME GROUP OF PEOPLE LOT US. AND THAT'S THE SAD PART ABOUT IT DEVELOPED THEY GO LIVE WITH IT AND DEAL WITH THAT. AND IT'S THE TICKETS ARE COME HOME TO ROOST ON SOME OF THE STUFF IS GOING TO COME BACK. YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON IN IN REALLY HAVE GOOD CONVERSATION I THINK. THIS BECAUSE VETTED THIS AND AND TALKED ABOUT IT WILL HAVE SOME REALLY IN DEPTH DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL THE INVOLVED PARTIES. SO PROVISIONS APART THIS PROVISION WAS NEVER TALKED ABOUT HOW WE FIX THIS WE GONNA DO. AND MOST YOUR FOLKS ARE GOING BACK TO STATE PRISON HERE IN THE COUNTY JAILS IN THE COUNTY SYSTEMS. THE COUNTY SYSTEMS OVER BURDEN RIGHT NOW YOU SEE LAWSUITS FOR YOUR COUNTY JAILS ASHER SERIFS FOR MEDICAL ISSUES WHICH STATE PRISONS GOT THE COUNTIES GETTING THAT NOW. PROBATION SEEING LAWSUIT SO WHAT WHAT THE STATE PROBLEM NOW IS TRICKLE DOWN THE COUNTIES AND IF IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP. SO I IS MIKE MY HEARTBURN RIGHT NOW IS WHAT DO WE GIVE MORE POWERS TO THE JUDGES MORE POWER THE JUDGES. THAT STARTED THIS. THEY RAISE THE BILLS GO BACK AND YOU GET YOUR BILL SCHEDULE FOR EACH COUNTY AND SEE HOW THE BILL'S PROGRESSIVELY INCREASE. BECAUSE OF JUDGES. THEY'RE STILL MAKING IT WEARING CAUCUS AND I ASKED SEE JUSTICE Y. WORKED WITH. I TALKED ABOUT IT JUDGES DO INCREASE THE BILL'S RIGHT YEAH SHE SHE AGREED JEFF. AS A PUBLIC THAT NO ONE EVER TALKED ABOUT IT'S NEVER MITCH MENTIONED HERE ON THE FLOOR. OR ANY HEARINGS WITH ME WHEN I SPOKEN. TO TOUGH BUT IF TEASING CAUCUS. SHE WAS DEAF TIAS PEOPLE FILLED TO APPEAR. SO YOU GOT TO FIX THOSE THINGS INTO A RIGHT AND USE EVERYONE'S GOT AN OPINION AND STUFF BUT IT TO YOU SEE IT AND LIVE IT. AND DO SOME THESE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN HURT. BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS LISTEN BAFFLES OTHER PERSON GOOD FOLKS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOUR TIME IS UP IF YOU COULD BRING YOUR COMMON A CLOSED BUT YOU MIGHT MY THING IS. LET'S DO IT THOUGHTFULLY WAS TO RATIONALLY. AND IN THE LAST YEAR NOW LET'S HAPPEN WITH THIS SO I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE ON THIS ITEM THANK YOU. SPEAKER RENDON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THEY THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. MEMBERS JUSTICE IS A JOURNEY AND SP TEN IS A STEP ON THAT PASS. I'VE SPOKEN TO A LOT OF US HAVE SPOKEN SINCE WE GOT HERE ABOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE. THIS BILL DOES NOT COMPLETE DOES NOT PROVIDE COMPLETE JUSTICE DOESN'T UP NOT PROVIDE COMPLETE ECONOMIC JUSTICE. BUT IT SHOWS THAT WE ARE BENDING IN THAT DIRECTION. BY ELIMINATING CASH BAIL WE ARE SAYING THAT THOSE WITH THE LEAST ABILITY TO PAY SHOULD NOT BE INCARCERATED SOLELY BECAUSE OF THEIR PROPERTY. CASH IS NOT THE MEASURE OF ANY WOMAN OR ANY MAN. AND ACCESS TO CASH. IS NO SIGN OF CHARACTER. WE ALSO NEED ONLY LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION FOR A MINOR THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP FIXING OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO BE FAIR. REGARDLESS OF YOUR INCOME. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IT PROVIDES IN FACT. JUSTICE FOR ALL. WE CAN BE THE ARCHITECTS OF THE ARC TOWARD JUSTICE. THERE IS MUCH TO DO. AND S. B. TED IS A START. I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON S. B.. TEN THANK YOU ALL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE HAVING CEASED TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I REALLY APPRECIATE THE RICH DISCUSSION THE COMMENTS ON BOTH SIDES. A LOT OF THE COMMENTS. WHAT WERE MADE? A YEAR AGO WHEN WE HAD A ROBUST CONVERSATION AS WELL ON AND I I APPRECIATE THOSE AND I THINK THAT'S A SIGN THAT. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS WE'VE BEEN DEBATING IT WE'VE BEEN HEARING EACH OTHER WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO EACH OTHER. YOU KNOW THE WHEN SOMEONE WAS SAYING THAT THIS IS BEEN RUSHED IT WAS. YOU KNOW I WAS HAVE FLASHBACKS OF ALL THE THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF MEETINGS THAT I'VE BEEN IN. AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE. FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS TO SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS TO CIVIL LIBERTARIAN GROUPS TO THE COURTS TO PROBATION. LAST YEAR WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS. MANY OF YOU SAID HEY LET'S WAIT FOR THE OF JUSTICE'S REFORM WORKGROUP. TO COME OUT WITH THEIR REPORT [inaudible] CHECK. WE DID THAT. WE LISTEN TO IT. EVEN COOPERATED THE COMMENTS IN THE INSIDE AND THE INPUT FROM THAT WORK GROUP REPORT INTO THIS BILL. SOME OF YOU SAID I'M CONCERNED THAT LONG FORSMAN. IS OPPOSED AND THEY'RE NOT BEING HEARD. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TALK MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS CHECK. WE WE DID THAT. I HEARD A COMMENT. IN DISCUSSION THAT LOTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SHARE SOME AROUND THE STATE ARE AGAINST THIS BILL. SO LET'S BIG LET'S JUST BE REQUIRE [inaudible] JUDICIAL COUNCIL SUPPORTS. CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IS NEUTRAL. THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION [inaudible] IS NEUTRAL. CALIFORNIA SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IS NEUTRAL. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE LOTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS AND THE SHERIFF THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE. BUT THOSE ARE THE OFFICIAL POSITIONS ON THIS BILL AND TO THE EXTENT [inaudible] THOSE ORGANIZATIONS [inaudible] ARE. TRYING TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN JUSTICE AND SAFETY AND ARE LOOKING UP FOR COMMUNITY SAFETY THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS BILL SO. THIS IS BEEN ANYTHING BUT RUSHED AND WE'VE HAD STAKEHOLDERS FROM. ALL OVER THE THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. EXPERIENCE WILL SPECTRUM INVOLVED IN DISCUSSIONS OVER THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOURS AND IT HUNDRED TO MEETINGS. THE COST WAS MENTIONED. IT IS NOT INEXPENSIVE. TO CREATE A FAIRER MORE JUST SYSTEM THAT RELIES ON PRE TRIAL SERVICES IN A RISK ASSESSMENT TO ON THE FRONT END. WE HAVE LEARNED FROM SOME OF THE BEST COUNTIES THAT HAVE DONE THIS THAT IF MEN AT THIS WE DON'T NEED PILOTS WE'VE HAD PILOTS. WE'VE HAD SANTA CLARA DOING THIS WE'VE HAD SAN FRANCISCO DOING THIS WE'VE HAD SANTA CRUZ DOING THIS. ALMOST FORTY COUNTIES ARE USING RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND RELY ON THEM. SO THIS IS NOT TIME FTA TO TO FOR A PILOT. IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE LEARNING TO THE TEACHINGS OF WHAT WORKS ON THE GROUND EVERY DAY CALIFORNIA. AND BRING IT STATEWIDE IT'S READY FOR PRIMETIME NOW. WE ALSO TOUCH SOMEONE TALKED ABOUT DETENTIONS. THERE'S GONNA BE MORE THAT'S GOING TO BE LESS. IS ANY LESS. SO TO BE UNSAFE OTHER NATIVE PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET RELEASED. AND HURT US. LET ME MORE IT'S UNFAIR TO GET HER TO REPUBLICAN. COLLEAGUE INVOKING ACLU FIRST TIME FOR THAT WHILE [inaudible] AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS. IT RELEASES THOSE WHO CAN SAFELY BE RELEASED. IT HAS APPROPRIATE TENSED DETENTIONS. IT REDUCES AND SIX TO ELIMINATE. INAPPROPRIATE DETENTIONS WHICH IS THE HALLMARK OF THE CURRENT. ATTENTIONS BASED ON MONEY. ARE ARE WRONG. NOW WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE. EVALUATED FOR YOUR SAFETY RISK. AND IF YOU CANNOT REALLY SAY THINK COMMUNITY. YOU WON'T BE. IF YOU CAN THEN YOU SHOULD BE AND YOU WILL BE. UNDER THE SPELL. A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD. SEEM TO BE ANIMATED BY. A A COMMITMENT TO THE STATUS QUO. BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN THAT WAY. EVEN FOR A LONG TIME DOESN'T MEAN HOUSE TO CONTINUE TO BE THAT WAY. ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM AN UNFAIR SYSTEM. AND ON SAY SIMPSON. AND YES CHANGE REQUIRES COURAGE. REQUIRES LEADERSHIP AND REQUIRES US TO BE BOLD. AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU. TO BE TODAY WE CAN'T BE PARALYZED BY THE FEAR CHANGE HEARD SO MY COLLEAGUES SAY THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. WE ARE STARING IN THE FACE THE OPPORTUNITY ROOM AGREES IS A FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN CSUS. AND TO SQUANDER THAT OPPORTUNITY. WILL BE WRONG WE NEED TO SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY. YOU COULDN'T PICK AT THIS BILL ALL YOU WANT. THE PERFECTION NOT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS A GOOD BILL. WE CAN IMPROVE IT OVER TIME ALSO BECAUSE NOTHING'S PERFECT A PERFECT SHOULD BE THE ASPIRATION. BUT THIS IS A GOOD BILL THAT WHAT AND THE SUFFERING. THE ANGUISH THE PAIN THE VICTIMIZATION. THAT HAS COME FROM THE CURRENT SYSTEM. WITH THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY. CAR SERRATED FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AT BEEN PUT AT RISK BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS UNSAFE. S. B.

BUT THIS IS A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN A PART OF MY LIFE SEEMS LIKE ALL OF MY LIFE. HER MUSIC HAS REALLY SHAPED MY SPIRIT AND MY SOUL. AND HAS MOTIVATED ME EVEN BEYOND THE CAPACITY THAT I BELIEVED AHEAD. HER SONGS LIKE RESPECT. IF YOU ONE TO DO RIGHT WOMAN YOU GOTTA BE A DO RIGHT MAN. TO GIVE YOU MISSION AND PURPOSE IN YOUR LIFE. SHE BEGAN SINGING JUST AS A CHILD SHE WAS BORN IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO IN MEMPHIS TENNESSEE. AND SHE BEGAN SINGING IN HER FATHER'S CHURCH IN DETROIT. SHE SANG WITH THE FAMOUS MAHALIA JACKSON AND SO MANY OTHERS. SHE TAUGHT HERSELF HOW TO PLAY THE PIANO. AND THEN SHE LEARNED TO READ SHEET MUSIC AND BEGAN TO COMPOSE SONGS ARE SELF. SHE WAS TRULY A MUSICAL GENIUS. SHE BEGAN SINGING AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN AND SO SHE SPENT OVER SIXTY YEARS. AS AN ARTIST. NOT JUST SOMEONE WE KNEW ABOUT SOMEONE WAS AN ACTIVE SINGER FOR SIXTY YEARS WHOSE VOICE WAS JUST A STRONG THE BASS HE PASSED. AS WHEN SHE FIRST BEGAN TO SING. SHE ALSO WASN'T NOTED FOR THE FACT THAT SHE OF HIM THAT WHEN SHE FOUND A SONG. AND SANG THAT SONG THE ARTIST PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT TO SING IT AGAIN. LIKE NATURAL WOMAN. BECAUSE AT THAT POINT SHE OWNED THAT SONG AND SHE BECAME THAT PERSON. AND SHE GAVE THAT SONG AS MOST ARTISTS SAID NEW LIFE AND NEW MEANING TO THE SONG ITSELF. SHE WAS BRILLIANT. IN HER MUSICAL ABILITIES. MOST OF US WERE STUNNED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WHEN SHE SANG THE OPERA [inaudible] A PAPARAZZI. SHE'D BEEN ONLY ASKS THAT DAY IF SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD STAND IN FOR HIM. BECAUSE HE COULD MAKE IT. AND SHE SAID WELL LET ME LISTEN TO IT. LET ME HEAR IT. AND SHE LISTENED TO IT. AND SHE SANG IT AND ALL OF US WERE IN AWE. OF THIS WOMAN'S ABILITY TO SING ANY TYPE OF MUSIC. WEATHER WAS WHAT THOSE GOSPEL WHETHER IT WAS JAZZ WHAT WAS BLUES WITH ROCK AND ROLL SHE COULD MASTER THAT SONG AND GIVE IT NEW LIFE. AND SO WE WERE ALL SHOCKED WHEN I SAW ON TELEVISION I WAS A MAYES. THE GRANTED AT THE GRAMMYS SINGING THIS SONG THAT YOU'D ONLY BEEN ASKED TO SING THAT DAY THAT MANY ARTISTS WOULD TAKE A LIFETIME TO LEARN TO MASTER. SHE WAS AN ACTIVIST WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ACTIVISTS THE DAY SOMEONE ASKED ME YOU KNOW IS IT UNUSUAL THAT ACTIVISTS ARE NOW STEPPING OUT AND SAYING BEINGS IN FIGHTING FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE. AND I HAD TO REMIND THE BUT SO MANY OF THE ARTISTS BEFORE THE ONES WE KNOW TODAY DID THAT. DISSIPATED ACTIVELY IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND SHE DID. SHE GOT PERMISSION FROM HER FATHER TO TRAVEL WOULD DOCTOR KING INTO SAYING IT ALL OF HIS RALLIES BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES SO STRONGLY IN WHAT HE WAS DOING. AND KNEW IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HER LIFE AND LIFE AND OTHERS TO COME. SHE DONATED MONEY INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AND WAS WILLING TO BELLA ANGELA DAVIS OUT OF JAIL WHEN ANGELA DAVIS WAS IN JAIL BUT SHE FELT THIS IS TO DESERVE JUSTICE AND SHE DESERVED TO BE FREE.

USE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD WALK AT A HOUSE AND SHE WOULD BE SITTING AT THE PIANO. PLAYING THE SONGS THAT WOULD INSPIRE THEM TO DO GREAT THINGS. RITA WAS MY FAVORITE SINGER. AND I KNOW THAT WHEN I WOULD TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN I TRAVEL FROM NEW YORK TO GHANA FOR EIGHT HOURS I WOULD LISTEN TO ARETHA WITHOUT STOPPING. AND SHE WOULD SOMEHOW OF THE MAKE THE RIDE A WHOLE LOT SMOOTHER. AND SHE WOULD ALWAYS MAKE ME FEEL BETTER WHEN I IN THAT IT. SOMEONE IS SAID THE QUEEN IS DEAD. BUT HER MUSIC LIVES ON AND SO SHE IT'S PROBABLY NOT A PERSON IN THIS HOUSE WHO CANNOT THINK OF THEIR FAVORITE SONG BY ARETHA. WHEN I ASK PEOPLE WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE SONG EVERYBODY TELLS ME DIFFERENT ONES? I DON'T REMEMBER IN THE DORMS AT UCLA RESPECT WAS IN EVERY WINDOW AND EVERY. HALL WHEN WHEN THE SONG CAME OUT IN. SIXTY SEVEN EVERYBODY WANTED TO LISTEN TO RESPECT. EVERYBODY WANTED A DO RIGHT WOMAN. EVERYONE WANTED I THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME IS LOVE YOU UNLESS YOU LET ME LOVE YOU. A NO WAY. THOSE SONGS SOMEHOW AND OF THE NOT ONLY GAVE LIKE. SHE DID AMAZING THINGS FOR THE ARTIST AND FOR THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF BLACK MUSIC IN BLACK HISTORY IN BLACK FEELING. BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID BLACK PEOPLE FEEL. THE EXPRESSIONS OF ARETHA. EVERY GROUP FELT ARETHA. AND THERE WAS NOT ONE WHO COULD NOT IDENTIFY WITH AT LEAST ONE SONG IF NOT ALL OF HER SONGS THAT MADE YOU FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. A WOMAN OF TREMENDOUS DEPTH AND SOUL IS GONE.
