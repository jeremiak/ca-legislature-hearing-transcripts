PARTICIPATING IN SOME OF THE

00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:55.760
PROGRAMS THAT I PREVIOUSLY

00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:57.062
MENTIONED BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY.

00:24:57.128 --> 00:24:59.364
WE'RE AMENDING IT TO ALLOW NON

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:00.632
VIOLENT --

00:25:00.699 --> 00:25:02.367
THE NONVIOLENT PRO PROCESS THIRD

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:03.802
STRIKERS DUE TO RECENT

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:05.370
LITIGATION WHICH IS --

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:06.571
I BELIEVE --

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:08.740
AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION OUR GOAL

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:09.875
IS TO SAFELY EXPAND THESE

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:11.443
OPPORTUNITIES AND EXTEND THEM TO

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:13.411
AS MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN

00:25:13.478 --> 00:25:14.679
BENEFIT THEM AS POSSIBLE.

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:16.715
I'M SURE WE ALL MAY BE ASKING AS

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:17.983
TO WHY ON A CONSTANT BASING HOW

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:19.618
DOES THIS AFFECT PUBLIC SAFETY

00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:21.653
WITH THESE CHANGES.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.587
RIGHT NOW I CAN SAY IT'S A

00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:24.089
LITTLE BIT TOO EARLY BUT I CAN'T

00:25:24.155 --> 00:25:25.390
WHAT I CAN SAY IS RECIDIVISM

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:26.958
RATE CONVICTION IN A THREE YEAR

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:29.027
FOLLOW UP PERIOD. FOR INMATES

00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:31.229
BEING RELEASED FROM CDC DOLLARS

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:32.664
NOW FORTY SIX POINT 1%.

00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:34.866
THAT'S FIVE POINT 4% LOWER THAN

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:36.902
IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AT

00:25:36.968 --> 00:25:38.203
THE MAX OF OVERCROWDING.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.404
AND AN EIGHT POINT TWO LOWER

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:42.140
THAN ITS PEAK IN.

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:42.741
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I TAKE TO

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:43.608
HEART --

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:44.209
THAT IN THE VAST CHANGES --

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:48.380
THAT RESEARCH HAS STAYED STABLE.

00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:50.949
THE PRISON POPULATION HAS LARGER

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:52.183
PERCENTAGES OF SERIOUS ABOUT AN

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.418
OFFENDER SENATE.

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:54.886
OFFENDERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EARN

00:25:54.953 --> 00:25:56.554
THEIR FREEDOM BY WEEKS MONTHS

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.156
AND EVEN YEARS THAN OTHERWISE

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:00.158
WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:00.759
EARNED IT I NEED TO EMPHASIZE

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:01.793
THAT.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.828
AT THE THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:26:03.895 --> 00:26:06.431
THE MOST SERIOUS OFFENDERS --

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:07.899
WE HAVE LIFE HAS BEEN RELEASED

00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:09.501
HOWEVER WE ARE CONSTANTLY

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.069
WORKING TO IMPROVE THIS RATE TO

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:12.003
ALLOW MORE OFFENDERS

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.438
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESS UPON

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:14.539
RELEASE.

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:16.107
OUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH HAS

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:17.709
CONDUCTED ASSESSMENTS ON THE

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:19.544
IMPACTS OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:21.012
WE'VE DISCOVERED.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.547
IS THAT THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:24.015
PAROLEES WITH THE TREATMENT NEED

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:25.050
WHERE RECEIVE IN PRISON

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:26.584
SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:29.387
TREATMENT WAS THIRTY EIGHT POINT

00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:31.756
5%. TO THE FORTY ONE POINT 4%

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:33.458
OFFENDERS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE IN

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:34.893
PRISON AFTER CARE.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.561
SO WE BELIEVE THAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:37.896
THE ONE YOU'RE READ --

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:39.197
ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE FOR

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:41.066
OFFENDERS WHO HAVE EARNED

00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:42.701
EDUCATION MERIT CREDITS HAVE RE --

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:47.005
UPON RELEASE WAS 9% IN.

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:47.639
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALTHOUGH

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:48.807
WE DON'T THAT DOESN'T APPLY AN

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:50.408
APPLES APPLES COMPARISON.

00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:51.710
THIS WAS LOWER THAN THE FISCAL

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.878
YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FOR A ONE

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:55.146
YOUR CONVICTION RATE OF EIGHTEEN

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:56.114
POINT.

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:57.682
THREE SO WE ARE SEEING SOME

00:26:57.749 --> 00:26:59.451
MOVEMENT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:00.251
FURTHERMORE CITY TERRACE

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:02.320
POPULATION PROJECTS PROJECTIONS

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:03.688
IN THE ADULT INSTITUTIONS

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:05.423
CONTINUE TO DECREASE.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.992
WELL THIS IS ENCOURAGING CHANGES

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:08.660
IN LAW SENTENCING PRACTICES IN A

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:09.728
NUMBEROF OTHER FACTORS CAN

00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:10.862
RESULT IN CHANGES TO THESE

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:12.497
PROJECTIONS.

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:13.665
SO WE NEED TO REMOTE WE NEED TO

00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:15.400
REMAIN EVER VIGILANT IN

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:17.235
MONITORING THESE PROJECTIONS.

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:18.436
BUT I'D BE REMISS ABOUT AND TAKE

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:19.871
A MOMENT TO REMIND THIS

00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:20.505
COMMITTEE THAT CITY SORRY WILL

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:21.272
BE.

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:23.008
SUBJECT TO THE POPULATION CAP TO

00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:24.275
STAB MISSION CONTINUES TO BE

00:27:24.342 --> 00:27:26.044
SUBJECT TO THE POPULATION CAP BY

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:27.145
THE THREE JUDGE PANEL.

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:27.879
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HAD A

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:30.448
POPULATION UNDER HUNT ONE

00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:31.583
HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:33.051
SINCE.

00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:33.818
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE SERVE

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:34.285
THE MONITOR THE INMATE

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:38.023
POPULATION WE ARE THREE THOUSAND

00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:38.790
THREE HUNDRED AND SEVEN UNDER

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:40.325
THAT POPULATION CAP.

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:44.596
HOWEVER WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY

00:27:44.662 --> 00:27:45.230
ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:46.264
THREE INMATES LEFT IN ARIZONA.

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:48.433
AND THE GOAL IS. TO HAVE THOSE

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.667
INMATES BACK BY JUNE THIRTIETH

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:51.369
OF THIS YEAR.

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:53.104
THE PLAN IS IN THE GOAL IS TO BE

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.839
SHIPPING ONE HUNDRED INMATES

00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:56.374
BACK TO CALIFORNIA ON A WEEKLY

00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:58.410
BASIS WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS GOAL.

00:27:58.476 --> 00:27:59.778
AND RIGHT NOW I MONITOR THIS

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:01.312
NUMBER ON A DAILY BASIS AND

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.348
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON TARGET.

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:05.050
WELL IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT I

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:07.552
SHOULD NOTE THAT --

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:09.421
ONE ONE FAULTY ROOF OR ONE BAD

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:10.789
COURT RULING COULD IMPACT THAT

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:12.924
NUMBER WITH THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED

00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:13.691
CUSHION ONCE WAS AND IT'S COME

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:14.059
BACK.

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.361
AND SO WE TRY AND STAY AHEAD OF

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:18.296
IT OUR FALL POPULATION

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:19.964
PROJECTIONS A PREDICT COURT

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.232
COMMITMENTS TO STATE PRISONS

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:23.535
WILL INCREASE ONE POINT 8%.

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.637
EXCEPT FOR MARGINAL DECREASE IN

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:26.104
NINETEEN TWENTY COURT

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:27.672
COMMITMENTS ARE PROJECTED TO

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:31.142
INCREASE ZERO POINT 3% EACH YEAR.

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:32.977
FOR THE REMAINDER OF PROJECTION

00:28:33.044 --> 00:28:34.546
CYCLES.

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:35.647
I RAISE THIS POINT AS A STEWARD

00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:36.815
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:38.416
AND REHABILITATION JUST TO

00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:39.751
EMPHASIZE THAT --

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:41.653
WE ARE VERY COGNIZANT OF THE

00:28:41.719 --> 00:28:43.488
THREE JUDGE PANEL CAP ALSO

00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:45.223
IMPLEMENTING POLICY CHANGES AND

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.559
EXPANDING PROP FIFTY SEVEN TO DO

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:48.993
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.528
A DECADE AGO ONLY A QUARTER IN

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:52.297
MY POPULATION WAS HOUSE ON LEVEL

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:53.431
TWO FACILITIES.

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:55.166
NOW OVER A THIRD POPULATES ON

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:56.568
LEVEL TWO FACILITIES AND THAT'S

00:28:56.634 --> 00:28:57.735
A GOOD THING BECAUSE AT THE

00:28:57.802 --> 00:28:59.737
LOWER LEVELS WE HAVE MORE --

00:28:59.804 --> 00:29:01.873
POPPING WE HAVE MORE PROGRAMS

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.941
AVAILABLE TO THEM.

00:29:03.007 --> 00:29:03.975
THE NUMBER OF INMATES A LONG

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:05.076
TERM RESTRICTED HOUSING IN OUR

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:09.013
OLD SHOES AT ONE POINT WAS --

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.682
FOUR THOUSAND NOW RIGHT THE LESS

00:29:10.748 --> 00:29:12.484
THAN EIGHT HUNDRED AS OF TODAY.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.284
IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE

00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:15.587
SEGREGATION'S OUR OUR ADS SAY

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:17.722
EGGS WE WERE AT EIGHT THOUSAND

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:20.391
WE HAVE LESS THAN.

00:29:20.458 --> 00:29:21.559
FOUR THESE ARE HIGH SECURITY

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:23.094
BEDS OF HIGH SECURITY STAFFING

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:24.462
NEEDS AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:26.297
REDUCE THOSE.

00:29:26.364 --> 00:29:27.198
THIS POINT IS EVEN THOUGH THAT

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:29.300
OUR POPULATIONS NOW EXCLUSIVELY

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:30.668
SERIOUS ABOUT AN OFFENDER'S THE

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:31.803
DEPARTMENT IS PROUD TO SAY THAT

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.171
WE ARE HOUSING AS MANY OFFENDERS

00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:34.272
AS WE CAN.

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:36.708
IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE BAD AND

00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:38.710
ROBUST PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES

00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:40.011
AS POSSIBLE.

00:29:40.078 --> 00:29:41.246
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT --

00:29:41.312 --> 00:29:42.480
SOME OF THE EXCITING THINGS ARE

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:44.048
OUT THERE WITH RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:46.351
ALMOST OVER FIVE THOUSAND

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:47.785
INMATES IN FACE TO FACE COLLEGES.

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:48.887
THEN -- IN

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.455
ALL OF OUR THIRTY TWO PRISONS.

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:52.323
ON A MORE BASIC LEVEL TO BE MORE

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.659
CRITICAL I MUST NOTE THAT.

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:57.862
47% OF THE POPULATION READ BELOW

00:29:57.929 --> 00:29:58.463
IN NINTH GRADE LEVEL WHEN THEY

00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:58.730
COME IN.

00:29:58.796 --> 00:30:00.698
AND ONLY 38% OF OUR POPULATION

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:02.233
OF HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS OR

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.001
EQUIVALENCY THAT'S WHY IT'S

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:05.136
IMPORTANT WE FOCUS ON LITERACY.

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:06.838
THAT WE FOCUS ON THIS AND THERE

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:08.840
IS A P. C. P. BEFORE THIS

00:30:08.907 --> 00:30:10.041
COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION TO

00:30:10.108 --> 00:30:11.276
FUND PROGRAMS.

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:12.177
THAT -- IF

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:13.878
SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AIM TO

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.246
IMPROVE LITERACY INCLUDING

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:17.649
DIAGNOSTIC A REMEDIAL READING --

00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:18.683
COMPUTER BASED LEARNING ENGLISH

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.886
THE YOUR MENTORING TRAINING

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:26.324
INMATES TO BE COACHES --

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:28.026
TO WRAP IT UP BUT I ALSO LIKE TO

00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:30.495
SAY THAT --

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:31.462
NINETY NUMBER THIRTY FIVE

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:32.597
PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN DELEGATED

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:34.432
BACK TO CDC ARE --

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.267
FROM THE FEDERAL RECEIVER THAT

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.602
PUTS US AT ABOUT 50%.

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:39.604
I LOOK CLOSELY I WORKED CLOSELY

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:41.472
WITH MR KELSO AND I LOOK FORWARD

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:42.941
TO FURTHER PROGRESS.

00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:44.475
I'M ALSO WORKING ON A FEW ISSUES

00:30:44.542 --> 00:30:45.677

GOING OVER THE SOME OF THE

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:03.708
FINDINGS RACKS AND ESSENTIALLY

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:06.043
THE AUDIT WAS TASKED WITH

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.845
REVIEWING --

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:09.180
NOT ONLY COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:11.115
THERAPY BUT ALSO ACADEMIC AND

00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:12.583
VOCATIONAL THERAPIES --

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.485
EDUCATION AT CDC ARE.

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:16.988
NOW THE PRIMARY FINDING WE HAD

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:18.456
CONCERNED --

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.057
CPT AND THE FACT THAT.

00:34:20.124 --> 00:34:21.492
THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:23.861
DIDN'T WE FIND RESULTS AND

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:25.463
REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.631
SPECIFICALLY WE ANALYZE TWO

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:28.366
GROUPS OF AN MASON THIS IS HOW

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:29.834
YOU REACH THAT CONCLUSION --

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.169
THE FIRST GROUP OF INMATES WERE

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:32.870
RELEASED IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:34.105
THOSE INMATES.

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:35.573
HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS NEEDING

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.442
SOME CBT PROGRAMS AT A COMPLETED

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:38.910
AT LEAST HALF OF THOSE.

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:39.677
THE OTHER --

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:41.245
GROUP OF INMATES ABOUT THIRTEEN

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:42.346
HUNDRED AND BOTH GROUPS WERE

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:44.248
ALSO RELEASED IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:46.050
HOWEVER THOSE INMATES I HAD

00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:46.651
RECEIVED.

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:48.319
NONE OF THE ATTENDED AND NOT

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:55.159
COME HIGHER TO RELEASE --

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:56.961
AFTER TWO YEARS WE LOOKED AT THE

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:58.663
RECIDIVISM RATES FOR BOTH GROUPS

00:34:58.729 --> 00:34:59.263
AND FOUND THAT THEY WERE THE

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.998
SAME ESSENTIALLY 2425%

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.433
RESPECTIVELY [inaudible]

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.135
NOW THAT.

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:06.170
WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IT DOES

00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:08.172
NOT APPEAR THAT I THAT --

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:10.908
THE CPT CLASSES HAD AN EFFECT ON

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.076
REDUCING RECIDIVISM.

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:15.680
WE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT --

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:17.181
IT'S DUE TO CDC OURS FAILURE TO

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:18.282
PROPERLY ADMINISTER THESE

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:20.418
PROGRAMS THE LEAD TO THEIR

00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:20.852
LIMITATION OF THEIR

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:21.853
EFFECTIVENESS.

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:23.087
NOW -- WE

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:24.622
CAN WITH THE THREE MAIN AREAS

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:26.357
THAT SEEM TO REALLY BE IMPACTING

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:27.658
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:31.362
PROGRAMS THE FIRST WAS --

00:35:31.429 --> 00:35:33.030
THAT CITY C. R. REQUIRES ALL OF

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:34.499
ITS VENDORS TO TEACH THE CVT

00:35:34.565 --> 00:35:35.800
PROGRAMS OUT OF CITY PROGRAMS

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.502
JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:39.504
OVERVIEW OF OUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.404
COGNITIVE --

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:40.872
SORRY --

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:43.574
CRIMINAL CRIMINOLOGICAL THINKING.

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.243
FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND ANGER

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:47.512
MANAGEMENT.

00:35:47.578 --> 00:35:48.346
THERE WAS SOME OF THE VENDORS

00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:49.447
THAT ARE TEACHING THESE PROGRAMS

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:50.882
THEY'RE ALL REQUIRED TO USE

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:51.849
EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:53.417
CROOKLYN THAT'S PROVEN TO WORK

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.186
HOWEVER WE FOUND IT THAT INTEND

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:57.288
THE PRISONS WE REVIEWED. 20% OF

00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:58.489
THE CURRICULUM HAD NOT BEEN

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:00.057
VETTED TO ASSURE THAT IT WAS

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:01.392
EFFECTIVE.

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:03.461
YEAH THIS IS CRITICAL.

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:04.028
IF YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.796
ANIMATE TO ATTEND A PROGRAM YOU

00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:06.330
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:08.933
PROGRAM IS PROVEN TO WORK.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.200
SO -- WE

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:12.870
RECOMMENDED THAT CDC AND GOING

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.238
FORWARD ENSURE THAT.

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.274
THE A CREEK --

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.409
PRACTICE MORE ACTIVE OVERSIGHT.

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:19.544
THE SECOND MAJOR ISSUE WE

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.412
IDENTIFIED WAS IN TERMS OF THE

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:22.813
ASSESSMENT TOOLS INMATES ARE

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.015
GIVEN.

00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:24.549
FOR RIGHT WHEN THEY ENTER

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.317
FACILITY THERE'S A COMPASS AND

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:27.885
CS ALREADY ASSESSMENTS THOSE

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:30.021
EVALUATED INMATES REHABILITATIVE

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.522
NEEDS OVER THE NEED AT AT MARCH

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:33.324
CATION PROGRAMS ANGER MANAGEMENT

00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:35.293
PROGRAMS. FOR THE FULL GAMUT OF

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:37.562
REHABILITATIVE SERVICES OFFERED

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:39.263
BY CDC ARE --

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.399
THE CSR A IS A VALUE WITH

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:42.900
RESPECT TO THE MAJOR CITY IN THE

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:43.467
FUTURE.

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:45.002
EVERY FOR THAT THOSE ASSESSMENT

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:46.504
TOOLS HADN'T BEEN REEVALUATED

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:48.039
INTENDED FIFTEEN YEARS

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:49.974
RESPECTIVELY EVEN THOUGH THE

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.008
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE INMATE

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.143
POPULATION IT CHANGE PRETTY

00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:53.477
DRAMATICALLY NOW YOU WANT TO

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.612
MAKE SURE THAT THE ASSESSMENTS

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:55.680
ARE ACCURATE.

00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:57.114
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU SAYS AN

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:58.449
INMATE IS NEEDING --

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:00.017
A CERTAIN CLASS WANNA MAKE SURE

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:01.052
THAT THEY ACTUALLY NEED THAT AND

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:01.719
ALSO THAT WHEN WHICH YOU'RE NOT

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:04.622
MISSING ANY CRITICAL NEED FOR

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:05.756
THESE INMATES.

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:10.227
AND A CITY SEARS INMATE.

00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:10.795
ELECTION HAS CHANGED PRETTY

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:12.229
DRAMATICALLY SINCE PROP.

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.364
FORTY SEVEN FINALLY AND MOST

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:14.765
IMPORTANTLY CDC ARE IS --

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.634
FAILING TO PROPERLY PRIORITIZE

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:18.035
INMATES INTO.

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:19.537
THESE PROGRAMS OFF OF THE WAIT

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:20.438
LIST.

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:21.739
SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT CITY

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:23.808
SERVICE CAN --

00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:25.843
RISK LOW NEED IN BATES INTO

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.211
THESE PROGRAMS WHEN SLOTS BECAME

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:29.380
AVAILABLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:29.914
WERE ASSIGNED TO ANY OTHER

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:30.982
ACTIVITY.

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:32.116
AND THAT THAT'S HOW THE

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:33.684
WEIGHTLESS FOR PRIORITIZING THEM --

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:35.286
INSTEAD OF THESE HIGH RISK HIGH

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:37.121
NEED IN BATES THAT WERE MADE

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:40.191
ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES LIKE --

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:43.160
SOUNDS KEEPING OR IN THE WORKING

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:44.261
IN THE KITCHEN.

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:44.829
YOU KNOW THEY COULD HAVE A

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:45.596
TRANSFER THESE WERE

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:47.365
REHABILITATIVE ACTIVITIES THEY

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.299
WERE ENGAGED IN AND THE NEEDED

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:49.867
THESE PROGRAMS BUT INSTEAD THEY

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.602
WERE LEFT WHERE THEY WERE AND

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:53.170
LOW RISK LOW NEED INMATES --

00:37:53.237 --> 00:37:56.040
SORRY LOOK RISK LIVE NEED

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:56.407
INMATES WERE --

00:37:56.474 --> 00:37:57.541
PUT IN INSTEAD.

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:58.876
WE THINK THIS CONTRIBUTED TO

00:37:58.943 --> 00:37:59.644
SOME --

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.045
PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL --

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:02.880
LOW ENROLLMENT NUMBERS FOR THE

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.383
CITIES YOUR PRIMARY DEMOGRAPHIC

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:07.151
WHICH IS YOU GET --

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:08.719
INMATES WITH RSS WITHOUT

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:10.187
MODERATE TO HIGH NEED.

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:12.690
IN ANY PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:13.391
ACTUALLY THEY PUT IN.

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:15.259
NOW WE'VE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:15.860
FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT I'VE

00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:17.528
JUST DISCUSSED BUT WE ALSO

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:18.863
RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:20.898
REQUIRE CDC ARE TO IMPLEMENT

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:21.499
OVER.

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:23.200
A PLAN THAT WE'VE DESCRIBED IN A

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:24.468
REPORT.

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:26.137
NOW THIS PLAN WOULD REQUIRE CDC

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:28.005
ARE TO CONTRACT WITH AN EXTERNAL

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:31.242
RESEARCHER SUCH AS UC IRVINE --

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:32.877
OR ANY OTHER OUTSIDE RESEARCH

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:34.378
WITH LARGE RESEARCH ENTITY AND

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:35.613
THAT THAT ENTITY WITHIN CONDUCT

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.148
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:38.683
BECAUSE OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:39.884
TO SEE BRITISH DOESN'T APPEAR TO

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.052
CHAU RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:42.486
ATTENDING THESE CLASSES AND

00:38:42.553 --> 00:38:43.821
REDUCE RECIDIVISM.

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:44.789
BUT WE NEED TO SEE HOW A

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:47.925
VOCATIONAL IT EDUCATION IMPACT

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.427
THESE RECIDIVISM RATES.

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.128
BECAUSE THE GOAL IS. TO HAVE

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:52.830
THIS FISCAL YEAR CDC OUR

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.265
CONTRACT WITH --

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:56.233
A RESEARCH ENTITY HAVE THE IT'S

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.169
A TO CONDUCT THAT WORK AND THEN

00:38:58.235 --> 00:38:59.804
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT CITY'S

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:00.371
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT WHAT'S

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:01.639
INEFFECTIVE.

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:02.606
AND START ELIMINATING THOSE

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:03.808
PROGRAMS AND THEN EXPANDING

00:39:03.874 --> 00:39:04.809
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY ARE

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:07.078
PROVN TO WORK OR COMBINATIONS

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:08.045
THEREOF --

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:09.213
THAT'S THE KIND OF HIGH LEVEL

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.815

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.086
WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN OR

BASED ON RISK AND NEED.

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.713
WE'VE ALSO MET WITH UNIVERSITIES

AND OTHER RESEARCHERS TO BEGIN

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:26.116
THE RESEARCH DESIGN FOR AN

WE'RE COMMITTED TO FINDING

00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:32.690
SOLUTIONS TO LOOK AND LOOK

REQUESTED.

00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:42.399
HELP YOU DECIDE AN INSTITUTION

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:43.934
IT'S GOING TO BE MONITORING YOU

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:44.835
SAY IT.

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.237
RESEARCH INSTITUTION EVEN SIDE

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:49.173
ONLY NOT TODAY WE'VE SPOKEN WITH

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.276
A COUPLE OF AND WERE WERE STILL

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:52.676
WORKING ON THAT.

00:41:52.743 --> 00:41:56.180
OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.781
YES MY SYSTEM.

00:41:57.848 --> 00:41:59.250
THANK YOU.

00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:01.452
JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS AT THE

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:02.253
GUY VISITED ALL OF YOUR

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:03.888
FACILITIES BEGAN TO A FEW OF

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:05.589
THEM.

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:07.057
AND THERE SEEMS TO BE.

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:08.592
SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:10.160
FACILITIES WITH WHAT'S AVAILABLE

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:12.296
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE PROGRAMS

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:13.831
THAT YOU EXACTLY PROVIDE.

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:16.467
BUT BASED ON OTHER PROXIMITY IS

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:18.235
THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:20.271
FUNDED OR RUN BY --

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:22.873
PEOPLE WHO ARE NEARBY AS OPPOSED

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.208
TO SOME OF THE THE INSTITUTIONS

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:26.110
THAT ARE FURTHER AWAY.

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:27.244
IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO PARSE

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.480
OUT SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES FROM

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:30.981
ONE INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER.

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.116
BUT ARE YOU FINDING

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:33.651
CONSISTENCIES I GUESS THIS IS

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.319
BOTH FOR THE AUDITOR AS FOR CDC

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.987
ARE.

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:38.656
SOME OF THESE INCONSISTENCIES

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:41.859
BASED ON LOCATIONS OR BASED ON

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:43.560
SITES OR IS.

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:44.995
COULD ALL OF THIS TRUE KIND OF

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:48.766
ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.701
WELL I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IT IS

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:53.570
TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD --

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:55.205
WE DO HAVE.

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:57.508
THAT ALL THE PRISONS DO HAVE A

00:42:57.574 --> 00:42:58.008
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:02.846
PROGRAMMING THAT'S GOING ON THE

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:04.281
THE MAJORITY THE PROGRAM IS

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:06.550
ACTUALLY STATE CIVIL SERVANTS

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:08.085
THAT ARE PAID.

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:10.387
THROUGH STATE FUNDS THOSE WOULD

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:11.922
BE OUR CLASSROOM TEACHERS.

00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:13.691
AND THE WE HAVE CONTRACTORS AS

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:15.659
WELL THAT PROVIDE ALL OF THE

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:16.727
KIND OF BE ABLE TREATMENT

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:18.262
PROGRAMS.

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:19.596
SO THAT'S A SMALLER PORTION OF

00:43:19.663 --> 00:43:20.898
WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO OUR PRIMARY

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:23.400
FOCUS IS ACTUALLY LITERACY AND

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:25.269
IN PREPARATION TOWARD COLLEGE

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:27.104
PROGRAMS.

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.105
RIGHT ALTHOUGH SOME AND SOME OF

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:29.840
THE PROGRAMS THAT I'VE GONE IN

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:31.442
TO SEE THAT ARE. FOR MORE

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:32.776
LOCALLY LACKS ADEQUATE AND AND

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:34.578
AND A FEW OTHERS WHICH HAVE SOME

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:36.213
PRETTY INTERESTING INNOVATIVE

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.015
PROGRAMS A LOT OF WHICH HAVE TO

00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:39.183
DO MORE WITH THE THERAPEUTIC

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:41.018
COMPONENT ADD.

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:42.152
SOME OF THE THAT.

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.654
I GUESS MORE INDEPTH QUESTIONING

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.656
THAT SOME OF THE INMATES GO

00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:47.391
THROUGH AS AS WAYS TO START TO

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:48.892
APPROACH GETTING THEMSELVES

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.294
READY TO BE ABLE TO GO BECAUSE A

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:52.463
LOT OF THESE FOLKS WHO COME IN.

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:54.598
TRAUMATIZED AND COME IN WITH

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:56.967
WITHOUT SOME BASIC.

00:43:57.034 --> 00:43:59.103
COGNITIVE ABILITIES THAT MAY NOT

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:01.005
BE READY TO GO INTO A SCHOOL

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:03.140
PROGRAM A GOING TO BE REALLY

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:04.775
READY.

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.210
TO THAT APPROACH THE PROGRAMMING

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:07.144
THAT'S THERE AND I THINK THAT

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:09.113
MAYBE THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:10.814
THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:12.316
BUT IT'S IT'S SORT OF SEEING

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:13.784
SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE GET

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.586
TO SEE AND SOME OF THE DAY TO

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:17.121
DAY PROGRAMS THAT THERE JUST

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:18.589
SEEMS TO BE SOME DIFFERENCES.

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:19.690
SITE TO SITE.

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:23.527
AND IF ALL OF THE INMATES ARE

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:25.429
REALLY READY. TO TO GO INTO THE

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:27.264
PROGRAMS AND OVERCOME SOME OF

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:27.865
THE ISSUES THAT THEY NEED TO

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:28.732
OVERCOME TO BE.

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.100
REALLY READY TO LEARN AND

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:33.937
WILLING TO TO TAKE ON THAT THE

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:36.373
EXPLORATION THAT THEY NEED TO GO.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.341
BECAUSE IF WE JUST PUT PEOPLE IN

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:38.342
CLASSROOMS TO PUT PEOPLE IN

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:40.244
CLASSROOMS WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:42.312
GOING TO SIX EXCEPT THAT I KNOW

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:42.679
YOU KNOW THAT.

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:46.150
BUT HOW DO WE ADDRESS THOSE.

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:47.751
DEEPER ISSUES THAT SOME OF THEM

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:50.320
NEED TO DO BECAUSE IT THERE.

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:51.955
READING LEVELS ARE VERY LOW.

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.991
THE ABILITY TO INTERACT

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.026
SOMETIMES OFTEN VERY LOW.

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:57.694
THAT TRAUMA SO THEY COME IN WITH

00:44:57.761 --> 00:44:59.296
THAT ARE ON THAT WITH THE BECOME

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:02.099
SOMETIMES BARRIERS. TO REALIZING

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.467
WHAT IS GOING TO HELP OR NOT

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:05.769
GONNA HELP FROM SOME OF THESE

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:06.070
INDIVIDUALS.

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:08.138
THE SCHOOL.

00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:10.340
LEARNING ABILITIES ARE VERY LOW

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:11.208
EVEN AS WERE SORT OF STRUGGLING

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:11.909
WITH.

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:15.112
OR WORKING WITH WITH YOU ON THE

00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:17.114
THE COPAYS AND SORT OF MEDICAL

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:18.849
ABILITIES THAT MEDICAL LITERACY

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:20.350
IS VERY LOW AND SOME OF THESE

00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:21.585
INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT.

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:23.353
THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS EQUIPPED TO

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.322
DEAL WITH LIFE IN IN VARIOUS

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.657
WAYS AND SOMETIMES WE NEED TO

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:28.892
TAKE TO GET THEM TO THAT STEP IN

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:30.494
ORDER TO THAN TO GO INTO.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.963
INTO CLASSROOMS AND SO IN SOME

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.498
OF THE FACILITIES THERE'S AN

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:35.933
ATTEMPT TO DO THAT AND OTHERS

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:37.067
THAT I'VE SEEN.

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:39.136
NOT ALWAYS AS MUCH I'M TRYING TO

00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:40.070
FIND.

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:41.505
A COMMON DENOMINATOR REALLY

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:42.506
UNDERSTAND.

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.975
THAT IN THE WAY THAT PROGRAMS

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.677
GET DELIVERED.

00:45:46.743 --> 00:45:47.678
YOU WANNA COME I COULD JUST

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:48.312
COMIC QUICKLY IF WE DID FIND

00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:49.713
THAT CITY TO SEE OUR HAD

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.914
EXPANDED.

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:55.285
BASIC C. B. T. TO ALL VISITS

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:55.953
HOWEVER THERE ALL THE I THINK WE

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:56.487
ARE FOR JUST HAVE THESE

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:58.655
VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS THESE MORE

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:00.524
LOCALIZED PROGRAMS.

00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.025
WE'VE RECOMMENDED THAT --

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:03.393
IF YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH NO ANALYSIS

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.928
IS BEEN DONE TO DEMONSTRATE

00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:06.330
THEIR EFFECTIVENESS YET.

00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:07.464
THAT IS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:09.666
STUDY CDC ARE SELECT SEVERAL

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:11.368
PROMISING LOOKING VOLUNTEER

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:13.637
PROGRAMS AND LOOK AT HOW WELL

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:15.172
THEY'RE REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:16.306
THEN CONSIDER EXPANDING KNOWS IF

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:17.808
THEY DO WORK WELL.

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.510
SO I THINK THE IDEA OF KIND OF

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.011
DOING SOME DUE DILIGENCE TO

00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:21.879
ENSURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:24.381
EFFECTIVE AND THEN --

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:25.883
EXPANDING THAT IF IT'S IF IT

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.184
SEEMS WORTHWHILE.

00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:28.585
AND AND THAT'S A KIA AT THINK

00:46:28.652 --> 00:46:30.888
THE THE UNDERLYING POINT AS WELL.

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:32.856
SOMETIMES WE WE LOVE THE

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:33.357
PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING

00:46:33.423 --> 00:46:34.992
DELIVERED THERE'S AN EXTERNAL

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:38.996
FUNDING SOURCE OR SOME SORT OF A

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:39.663
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM THAT COMES IN.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:41.698
MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:43.834
AND FOR US.

00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:44.968
GET OUT OF WE NEED TO GET OUTOF

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:46.103
THE MODE OF JUST.

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.138
DOING PROGRAM FOR SIGNATURE

00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:49.406
PROGRAM LOOK AT AFFECT THIS AND

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:50.807
LOOK AT WHAT'S REALLY.

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:51.975
MEETING THE NEEDS OF THOSE ON

00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:53.911
THE INSIDE SO THAT THAT'S GOING

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:56.313
TO END UP PRODUCING THE

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:56.914
RECIDIVISM AND THAT'S THE END

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:57.881
GOAL.

00:46:57.948 --> 00:46:59.383
SOME OF THESE FOLKS WILL END UP

00:46:59.449 --> 00:47:00.984
FOR SEDATING BUT THE MORE WE CAN

00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:03.921
PREVENT THAT AND THE MORE WE WE

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:06.390
CAN POINT TO DIRECT SIGNIFICANT

00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:07.591
RESULTS AND THE BAD.

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.593
WE'RE HAVIN A MUCH DEEPER IMPACT

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.261
ON RECIDIVISM A PRISON

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:14.998
POPULATIONS BACK IN COMMUNITIES

00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:15.432
THAT.

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:17.134
IN A WAY THAT WE KNOW ARE GOING

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:18.202
TO BE PRODUCTIVE TO THAT

00:47:18.268 --> 00:47:20.103
COMMUNITY AND KEEP THAT HELP

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.071
KEEP THAT COMMITTEE SAFER RATHER

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:21.572
THAN.

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:23.140
GOING BACK TO THE LIFESTYLE THAT

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:24.608
THAT THEY HAD COME IN AND SO

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.410
THAT EFFECTIVENESS THAT LOOKING

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:29.012
AT THE BROUGHT THE PROGRAMS THAT

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:30.647
THAT AND HOW THEY THE

00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:31.915
INTERACTIVE THINK IS.

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:33.283
ULTIMATELY PORT.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:34.351
YES I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:36.954
SAYING AND AND I THINK IT'S ALSO

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.088
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT.

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:39.189
THAT -- AS

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:40.357
YOU STATED THE ECONOMY HERE

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:42.259
TREATMENT PROGRAMS HAVE OVER THE

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:43.727
PAST THREE YEARS EXPANDED FROM

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:46.863
LITERALLY THIRTEEN PRISON YARDS.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.632
NOT THIRTEEN PRISON BUT THIRTEEN

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.667
PRISON YARDS TO EVERY YARD IN

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:52.402
EVERY PRISON SO THE THE

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:54.104
EXPANSION EFFORT HAS BEEN HAS

00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:55.639
BEEN SIGNIFICANT THAT WE'VE GONE

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:58.041
THROUGH --

00:47:58.108 --> 00:48:00.043
AS WELL AS WE ARE AWARE OF THE

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:01.211
FACT THAT.

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:02.713
THAT THE METROPOLITAN AREAS

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:04.481
WHERE THERE'S A PRISON NEARBY

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:05.616
THEY SUPPLY QUITE A VOLUNTEER

00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:08.018
FORCE AND AND THERE IS LIKE A

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:10.554
SAN QUENTIN OR SOLANO OR

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:11.955
LANCASTER STATE PRISON.

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:12.923
THEY MAY HAVE A GREATER

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.524
VOLUNTEER FORCE SO FOR THIS

00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:16.159
REASON THROUGH THE HELP OF THE

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.728
LEGISLATURE OVER THE PAST FOUR

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:18.996
YEARS WE HAVE.

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:19.663
BEEN IMPLEMENTING THE INNOVATIVE

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.566
GRANT PRO.

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:25.035
A COUPLE.

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:25.636
HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT WERE OUT

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:27.070
THERE BEFORE ME THEY WERE IN

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:28.505
SOME OF THE METROPOLITAN AREAS

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:31.375
BUT THEY'VE NOW EXPANDED. TO THE

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:32.976
LESS POPULATED PRISONS.

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:35.245
ABOUT BUT WE ALSO REALIZE THE

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:37.114
IMPORTANCE OF VALIDATING AND

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.515
VERIFYING THAT THAT THEY

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:39.583
ACTUALLY WORK.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.251
RIGHT RIGHT AND AND THAT'S GOOD

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:42.753
AND THAT'S THE THE PART THAT WAS

00:48:42.819 --> 00:48:44.121
A LITTLE HARD.

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:44.755
TO THE FOR ME TO KIND OF PARTS

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:45.622
OUT WHERE.

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:47.424
ALL OF THE THE PROGRAMS WORK

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:48.525
SAID THAT HAS BEEN OR AND I KNOW

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:49.359
THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS LOOKED

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.227
AT IS.

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:51.461
IS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT OF

00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:52.996
VOLUNTEERS NEARBY THERE'S A

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.765
BENEFIT TO THAT HOW DO WE MAKE

00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:56.333
SURE THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THE

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.404
SAME LEVEL OF IMPACTED AND ALL

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.872

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:14.244
VENDORS ARE TEACHING CLASSES

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:15.879
THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED.

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:19.583
AND AB OF REALITY THEIR

00:50:19.649 --> 00:50:20.584
ASSESSMENT TOOLS.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:21.985
IN ADDITION WE'VE ALSO MADE

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:24.488
RECOMMENDATIONS --

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:24.921
FOR LIKE LEGISLATIVE

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.790
RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE THAT

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:29.993
CDC R. E. D. D. CAN SHARE. FOR

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:30.827
INFORMATION SUCH AS SOCIAL

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:33.096
SECURITY NUMBERS THAT WILL ALLOW

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:34.865
YOU DD AND CDC ARE TO DETERMINE

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:36.333
HOW EFFECTIVE THE VOCATIONAL

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.367
PROGRAMS ARE BECAUSE THEY'LL BE

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:38.769
ABLE TO TRACK IN WEEKS AFTER

00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:40.871
RELEASE TO DETERMINE IF THEY

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.072
HAVE -- JEFF

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:44.608
THEY FOUND JOBS IN THE FIELD

00:50:44.674 --> 00:50:47.077
THAT THEY WERE TRAINED.

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.245
WE HAVE ADDED A FEW

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:49.112
RECOMMENDATIONS ON OUR PART

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:50.280
THESE INCLUDE IN CHINA THAT ALL

00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:52.682
PROGRAMS ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:54.618
EXTENT THAT.

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:56.219
THIS DEPARTMENT TO DO SOMETHING

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:56.887
INNOVATIVE WITH LEGISLATURE WENT

00:50:56.953 --> 00:50:57.754
THROUGH SOMETHING INNOVATIVE TO

00:50:57.821 --> 00:50:59.990
DO IT ON A PILOT BASIS THAT WE

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.525
CAN TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IT --

00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:03.059
WE ALSO RECOMMENDED TARGETING

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:05.362
THE HIGHEST FIRST CAUGHT SNEAD --

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:07.998
OFFENDERS FOR PROGRAMS THIS IS A

00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:10.100
LOT NORTH RESEARCH IN THE FIELD --

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.635
AND ALSO RE RECOMMENDED

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:14.905
IMPROVING OVER TIME THE PROGRAMS

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:16.540
USING PERFORMANCE MEASURES

00:51:16.606 --> 00:51:16.840
[inaudible]

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:18.642
AND TOM.

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:20.944
GIVEN THE COMMON.

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:22.512
LACK OF EVALUATION OF THE

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:24.414
CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE YOU AWARE

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:25.916
OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT EXIST.

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:26.783
IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT HAVE BEEN

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:30.287
EVALUATED.

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:31.788
YEAH THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:32.289
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:34.124
EVALUATED FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:36.092
AND OUR SON --

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:37.627
DATABASES OUT THERE ARE OF

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:38.862
PROGRAM TO HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:40.397
EFFECTIVENESS --

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:42.332
I WOULD ADD THAT IN ADDITION TO

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:42.866
MAKING FOR THE PROGRAM IS

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.634
RESOURCE BASE AS BEEN PROVEN TO

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:46.102
BE EFFECTIVE ELSEWHERE.

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:47.537
MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM HAS

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:48.572
BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITH FIDELITY

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:52.142
HILL OR TO INSURE THAT ACT ON

00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:53.477
THE FACT.

00:51:53.543 --> 00:51:55.345
ANSWER FIFTY DELIVERY --

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:56.313
TO ENSURE THAT THAT PROGRAM HAS

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:57.514
BEEN IMPLEMENTED A IN ACCORDANCE

00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:58.949
WITH THAT PROGRAM IT'S BEEN

00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:00.984
BASED OFF OF THAT IT'S TIME THAT

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:02.085
SENT FAX HERE.

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:03.186
IN IN THE PROGRAM'S YOUR FRONT

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.254
DOOR ARE PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOT

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:05.956
IN CALIFORNIA BUT OUTSIDE OF

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:06.923
CALIFORNIA --

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.058
SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN ADOPTED

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:09.860
BY CALIFORNIA BUT YEAH GENERALLY

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:11.428
WITH THE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:12.162
TO GO LOOK FOR A PROGRAM THAT

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:14.431
HAS BEEN TESTED ELSEWHERE OR ARE

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:15.165
GOING TO JAIL OR PRISON IN

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:20.303
ANOTHER STATE OR A COUNTY.

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.771
AND THAT ADOPTED HER.

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:22.372
SO IT WOULD YOUR WOULD YOUR

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.307
RECOMMENDATION BE TO NOT.

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:26.176
TO FURTHER INVESTMENT IN THESE

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:26.676
PROGRAMS AND TELL OTHERS

00:52:26.743 --> 00:52:29.112
EVALUATION --

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:30.981
WE HAVE NOT GOT.

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:31.481
THE TO THAT LEVEL ON THE

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:34.251
RECOMMENDATION [inaudible]

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:38.655
WAS A I'M NOT A CHARLOTTE THAT

00:52:38.722 --> 00:52:39.689
WHY WE DON'T GO TO THAT LEVEL I

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:42.325
WOULD SAY THAT --

00:52:42.392 --> 00:52:43.760
WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROGRAMS

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:45.362
THAT ARE FUNDED OUR EVIDENCE

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:46.329
BASED.

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:47.998
ROAD AND SAY THEY CANCEL THE

00:52:48.064 --> 00:52:49.633
PROGRAMS ARE IN EXISTENCE.

00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:51.501
BE A PROGRAMS ARE EVIDENCE BASED

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.570
AND WE DON'T HAVE A EVALUATION

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:54.971
PROGRAM SO HOT WHY WOULD WE

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.640
CONTINUE.

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:57.974
TO MAINTAIN THESE CONTRACTS

00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:00.844
UNTIL WE HAVE EVIDENCE --

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:01.845
ALL.

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.013
TO FORTY WELL WILL NOTE THAT THE

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:04.981
THE DAUGHTER FOUND THAT 80% OF

00:53:05.048 --> 00:53:07.884
THE PROGRAMS WERE EVIDENCE BASED.

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:10.887
AND THE OTHER 20%.

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:12.255
WE CONSIDER THEM ACTUALLY

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:14.591
EVIDENCE BASED BUT THEY JUST

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:17.060
WEREN'T FOUND WITHIN THE P. --

00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:18.828
TO THE PEW CLEARING HOUSE.

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:21.398
SO I APOLOGIZE I GUESS TO THE

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:23.033
THE SAMPLE SIZE THAT HE REFERRED.

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:24.901
TO HIM TO TO SAMPLE SIZES AND

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:26.136
APOLOGIZED AND PLAYED IN THE

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:28.305
YEARS ON SEVENTEEN FIVE AND ONE

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.907
WAS EIGHTEEN SO --

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:31.408
I'VE SO WE LOOKED AT TWO

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:33.410
DIFFERENT GROUPS AND THAT WAS --

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:34.811
FOR CPT ACTUALLY REDUCE

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:35.879
RECIDIVISM --

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:38.381
BUT THE WELL I WAS DISCUSSING A

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:40.050
LITTLE BIT LATER WAS THAT THE

00:53:40.116 --> 00:53:40.884
TEN PRISONS WE LOOKED AT WE

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.686
LOOKED AT THE CURRICULUM OF CVT

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:43.887
AT EACH AND WHETHER THAT WAS

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:45.055
EVIDENCE BASED.

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:48.091
AND WE FOUND THAT IT ONLY 17%.

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:50.060
I'M SORRY I WE HAVE ROUGH

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:52.562
ROUGHLY 20% WERE NOT EVIDENCE

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.864
BASED SO OF THE CURRICULUM THAT

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:56.466
WAS OFFERED AT THOSE PRISONS.

00:53:56.533 --> 00:53:58.168
MANY OF THEM WERE FOUND TO BE IN

00:53:58.234 --> 00:53:59.135
THE TIãU DATABASE THAT YOU

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:01.605
DIDN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF THEM

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:03.073
BEING SUCCESSFUL.

00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:04.708
WELL WE WE LOOKED VISIT LOOKS AT

00:54:04.774 --> 00:54:06.309
AUDLEY AT AT A AT A SAMPLE OF

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:10.313
INMATES FOR THE WERE RELEASED IN.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.047
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHETHER THEY

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:12.248
WERE EVIDENCE BASED OR NOT WE

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:13.483
DIDN'T FIND THAT THE CVT

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.085
PROGRAMS THEY OFFERED APPEAR TO

00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:16.786
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH A

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:18.221
REDUCED RATE OF RECIDIVISM HE

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.322
DIDN'T DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:20.357
EVIDENCE BASED ARE.

00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:21.691
NOT EVIDENCE BUT THERE WERE

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:23.526
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH --

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:26.096
PRESENT AT THE TIME THAT KIND OF

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:28.331
HAD THAT --

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:29.265
THE POPULATION BIG ENOUGH FOR US

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:30.700
TO DO THAT ANALYSIS WE DID

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:35.905
CONTROL FOR THE PRUDENT TO BOTHGROUPS OF INMATES. FOR RACE AGE

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:38.441
EDUCATION AND CRIMINALITY YOUR

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:39.743
CONCLUSION WAS BASED ON THE

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:41.077
PROGRAM AND THAT WAS OFFERED YOU

00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:42.946
TO FIND ANY EVIDENCE THAT THEY

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:43.313
WERE SUCCESSFUL.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.547
THAT.

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:45.882
SO I'M JUST GOING BACK TO SEE

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:47.350
YOU SEE ARE YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:50.587
AWARE OF THESE SITUATIONS SINCE.

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:53.089
SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:54.224
AND YOU LISTED A NUMBER OF

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.659
THINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE ONE OF

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:57.627
THE KEY CRITIQUES WAS THE LACK

00:54:57.694 --> 00:55:00.130
OF EVALUATION YET --

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:01.231
DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.832
CONTINUES TO BE. TO CONTINUE TO

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:04.200
THINK ABOUT EVALUATING BUT NOT

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:06.036
HAVING DONE IT JUST WANT TO KNOW

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.003
WHY IT'S TAKEN MORE THAN A YEAR

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.638
AND A HALF TO DO THAT.

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:09.539
WELL THE OVER THE PAST. TWO AND

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:12.976
A HALF BEEN FOCUSED ON BRINGING

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:14.711
PROGRAMS UP.

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.346
AND BRING THEM BACK TO WITHOUT

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.014
OR THE WITHOUT HAVING A PLAN TO

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:19.816
EVALUATE THE SUCCESS WE WE'VE

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:21.484
ALWAYS HAD A PLAN TO EVALUATE

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:24.354
BUT WE NEED TO HAVE A PROGRAM IN

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:26.289
PLACE BEFORE WE CAN EVALUATE IT.

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:28.091
AND AN ENGLISH AND USUALLY WHEN

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:30.226
YOU PUT A PROGRAM PLACE YOU HAVE

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:31.628
BEEN EVALUATION PROTOCOL.

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:34.597
WHEN YOU DO THAT SAID THAT BUT

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:35.265
THAT DIDN'T OCCUR YOU'RE SAYING?

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:36.900
THAT IS CORRECT.

00:55:36.966 --> 00:55:38.001
SO.

00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:39.436
KNOWING THIS ISSUE EXISTED A

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:40.804
YEAR AND A HALF AGO EIGHTEEN

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:42.505
MONTHS LATER WHERE DO IN THIS

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:43.740
EVALUATION.

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:45.475
AS I STATED EARLIER WE HAVE

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:47.644
SPOKEN WITH WITH A COUPLE

00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:49.045
DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES.

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:51.448
AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT THIS

00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:53.149
EVALUATION MIGHT LOOK LIKE --

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:54.818
THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:56.653
COMPLEXITIES TO VIOLATIONS SUCH

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.055
AS THIS BECAUSE YOU YOU CAN'T

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:00.457
JUST EVALUATES.

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:02.826
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA PROGRAM

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:05.028
MORE CBT PROGRAM INDEPENDENTLY

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:07.530
BECAUSE MANY OF THESE FOLKS HAVE

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:09.766
WELL CALL CO CURRENT ISSUES.

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:11.434
AND SO HOW DO YOU KNOW IN

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:13.169
REALITY THAT IT WAS THE CVT

00:56:13.236 --> 00:56:14.938
PROGRAM THAT WORKED AS OPPOSED

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:15.939
TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAD A HIGH

00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:18.341
SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR A A DEGREE.

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:21.177
AND SO IT'S A VERY SOPHISTICATED

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:27.016
STUDY THE NEEDS TO BE DONE

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:27.317
[inaudible]

00:56:27.383 --> 00:56:32.856
SO ON HE YOU YOU GOT AN ORDER

00:56:32.922 --> 00:56:34.357
SAYING THAT.

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:36.359
THE AUDITOR'S NOT CONVINCED THE

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:37.727
PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:39.462
IMPLEMENTING OUR SUCCESSFUL.

00:56:39.529 --> 00:56:42.165
SO WHY CONTINUE TO DO THEM ONE I

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:44.334
CAN NEW ONES.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.735
I HAVEN'T I HAVE AN AUDITOR I

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:47.871
KNOW IT'S GOING TO JUMP IN YOU

00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:48.838
CAN JUMP IN ANYTIME WELL WHEN

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:50.373
THE CLAIM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.574
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:53.309
THAT THAT AT THE TIME OF THE THE

00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:54.377
DATA THAT THEY LOOK AT FOR THE

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:55.712
AUDIT WAS AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:56.613
WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT

00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:58.114
INVESTMENTS IN REHABILITATION

00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:59.315
PROGRAM STATEWIDE.

00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:00.650
AND THE DEPARTMENT IS IS DONE AN

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:02.685
EXCELLENT JOB IN GETTING THAT

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:05.655
OUT TO ALL THE INSTITUTIONS --

00:57:05.722 --> 00:57:06.222
THE CURRICULA THEY PICK AS

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:09.292
PRIMARILY SCHISM IN THE AUDIT

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:11.060
WAS THAT THE WHAT THE CURRICULUM

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:12.228
IS EVIDENCE BASE.

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:13.463
SOME PORTION OF IT IS NOT

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:14.664
WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING TAUGHT TO

00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:15.899
THEY WERE USING THE CURRICULUM

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:17.133
THE EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM IN

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.368
THE INSTITUTIONS.

00:57:18.434 --> 00:57:19.769
I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:21.638
CONCERN WITH THE EVALUATION IN

00:57:21.704 --> 00:57:23.873
TERMS OF HOW IT AFFECTS THE THE

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.775
POPULATION MOVING FORWARD AND

00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:26.342
WHETHER OR NOT THEY BUT IT

00:57:26.409 --> 00:57:28.144
REDUCES RECIDIVISM.

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:29.746
BUT AGAIN WE'RE NOW LIKE

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:30.747
INTERVIEW WE ARE IN OUR THIRD

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.182
YEAR OF SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:33.516
WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:36.186
THOSE CHANGES IN THE NEXT THREE

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:37.287
TO FIVE YEARS AS THAT POPULATION

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:38.655
TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE.

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:39.656
OF ALL THE REHABILITATIVE

00:57:39.722 --> 00:57:41.624
PROGRAMS BOTH C. B. T.

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:43.960
INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING AND

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:45.895
EDUCATION.

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:47.730
THIS WILL GIVE ME ONE SECOND SO

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.265
Gí

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:50.934
SAID YOU'VE DONE ON AFRICA THE

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.002
WORD YOU USE BUT AN EXCELLENT

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:54.037
JOB.

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:54.804
THAT'S BASED ON WHAT.

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:56.105
DOES THE SIMPLE FACT OF BEING

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.574
ABLE -- TO

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.875
ROLL OUT ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:00.343
STATEWIDE AS A DIRECTOR CHUCK

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:02.111
MENTIONED THEY WERE IN THIRTEEN

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:03.479
YARDS AND NOW THEY ARE STATEWIDE

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:04.914
THEY ARE PROVIDING.

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:05.648
THESE.

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:07.083
THEY HAVE THE SLOTS AVAILABLE

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:08.952
THEY ARE PROVIDING THE THERAPIES

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:11.187
AND TREATMENTS TO THE I MEAN IT.

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:12.288
CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF

00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:14.324
INSTITUTIONS NUMBER OF INMATES

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.859
THAT WERE SERVING AND OF THE

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:16.793
COMPLEXITY IS GIVEN THE

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.228
DIFFERENT SECURITY NEEDS EACH

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:19.562
INSTITUTION.

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:20.964
I WOULD CONSIDER IT SUCCESSFUL

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.067
THAT THEY HAVE ANY RUNNING OUT

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:25.602
TO TO IT MAKES.

00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:27.971
BUT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE ONE WITH

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:28.504
THE OTHER WHETHER THEY'RE

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:31.341
ACTUALLY REDUCING RECIDIVISM.

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:32.809
AND AND AGAIN.

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:34.344
WE ARE IN OUR THIRD YEAR OF OUR

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:35.879
FOR BASICALLY FULL EXPANSION WE

00:58:35.945 --> 00:58:37.647
ARE AT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:38.514
MILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:41.050
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS --

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:43.786
THAT ARE HIGHEST SINCE TWO

00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:45.054
THOUSAND NINE TEN PER INMATE.

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:47.423
AND AGAIN IT TAKES. THREE TO

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:50.093
FIVE YEARS AFTER THAT COHORT IS

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:51.895
COMPLETED. TO TO SEE THE RESULTS

00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:54.130
OF RECIDIVISM BUT AS A DIRECTOR --

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:55.365
SKEWS ME SECRETARY D. AS

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:57.267
MENTIONED EARLIER IN HIS OPENING

00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:59.135
REMARKS WE HAVE SEEN RESULTS AND

00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:01.070
REDUCING RECIDIVISM I GET.

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:03.806
THAT IT'S NOT AS AS SPEEDY OR AS

00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:06.476
SIGNIFICANT I THINK AS MOST OF

00:59:06.542 --> 00:59:08.778
US WOULD PREFER BUT AGAIN WE ARE

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.413
MAKING HEADWAY THEY ARE USING

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.681
EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMMING THEY

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:13.149
HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS AND WILL

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:14.517
CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS AS

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:15.285
IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDITOR'S

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:17.754
REPORT. TO ADDRESS MANY OF THOSE

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:20.323
THINGS SO --

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.859
OF THAT OF THOSE COHORTS HAS

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:25.862
THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS AS TO

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.363
WHETHER THEIR RECIDIVISM RATE IS

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:29.799
HIGHER THAN COURTS HAVE NOT GONE

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:32.168
THROUGH THE PROGRAM [inaudible]

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:33.536
WELL THAT.

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:35.204
SO THEY THEY LOOK AT AND I'M

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.307
GOING TO DEFER TO HOPEFULLY --

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:38.274
ONE OF THE FOLKS AND SEE IF YOU

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:39.742
ARE A REGARDING THAT BUT YOU

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:42.211
LOOK AT THE THREE YEARS POST

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.012
RELEASE.

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:46.182
AND SO IF WE ARE JUST NOW AT NOT

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:48.151
IS NOT WHAT WE CONSIDER FULL

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:48.584
IMPLEMENTATION OF A

00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:49.752
REHABILITATION.

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:51.955
TATIAN PROGRAMS BUT WHAT'S RIGHT --

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:52.655
REFLECTED AS A SIGNIFICANT

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:54.624
INVESTMENT A REHABILITATION

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:55.425
PROGRAMS.

00:59:55.491 --> 00:59:56.759
WHEN WE START LOOKING AT

00:59:56.826 --> 00:59:59.462
RELEASES AND SEVENTEEN EIGHT THE

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:00.430
NOW THREE YEARS OUT WE WOULD

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:01.731
LOOK AT THAT COHORT I BELIEVE

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:03.633
THAT THAT'S THE DATA THAT THEY

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.134
LOOK AT IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISM?

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:07.170
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:00:07.236 --> 01:00:08.338
THE AND WHAT IS THE DATA SHOPS

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:10.707
ARE SO THEY LOOK AT IT WHAT IT

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.308
WHAT IT CHAU EXCUSE ME.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.543
I WILL DEFER ANYBODY WANNA

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:14.477
CONFIDENCE THAT QUESTION IN

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:17.480
TERMS OF THE ACTUAL --

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.415
LOOK AT RECIDIVISM RATES FROM

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:20.049
ELDERLY MISLI INCARCERATED BUT

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.918
WE ALSO MAKE A POINT THAT THE

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.853
AUDITOR'S REPORT SPECIFICALLY

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.589
TALKS ABOUT JUST 25% OF THE

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:29.892
PROGRAMS THE CB TEAS.

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.327
BUT ONLY I I DO UNDERSTAND ABOUT

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:35.465
I'M ASK ABOUT YOUR NUMBERS WHAT

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:37.333
ARE YOUR NUMBER SIR.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.434
SO WE'VE DONE WE'VE ROLLED OUT

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:40.403
PROGRAMS AND NOW THEY'RE IN

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.170
EVERY SINGLE YARD WORK.

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:42.905
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE?

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.674
AND WHAT DO YOU HI WOULD YOU

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:45.241
KNOW ABOUT HOW WELL THEY'RE

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:46.776
DOING.

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:48.511
THERE'S A LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.113
FEEDBACK THE MEDIA INTRODUCED

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.180
YOU TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR RYAN

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:52.715
SEUSS --

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:53.249
FROM THE DIVISION RESULTED

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.817
PROGRAMS.

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:56.319
A GOOD AFTERNOON FRANCES --

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:57.587
DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR YOU --

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.155
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS SO SOME

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.456
OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE UP

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:02.892
FRONT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.093
CREATING THE TOOLS TERMS OF DATA

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.395
COLLECTION DATA EXTRACTION AND

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:06.729
ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY WHICH

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:07.897
IS REFERENCE EARLIER BECAUSE WE

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:09.232
KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE.

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:10.500
THAT IS FOR SURROUNDING REALLY

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.168
ARE CBT PROGRAMS WHERE

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:13.669
NATIONALLY WE KNOW THAT THE CVT

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:15.671
PROGRAMS CAN WORK IF IMPLEMENTED

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.206
WITH ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:18.241
AND THAT'S THE TOOL THAT WE

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:19.475
REALLY CREATED AROUND THOSE.

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.177
THAT RECIDIVISM MENTIONED BY

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.912
SECRETARY DS EARLIER SHOWS A

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:25.081
SLIGHT REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:26.049
FOR THE MOST RECENT KEY

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.984
TOLERANCE LIGHT IT WAS ABOUT 3%

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:29.419
OFF OF THE POPULATION BASED ON

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:30.453
FROM WHAT PERCENT OR PERCENT.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.659
I THINK IT WAS 41% 238% --

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:37.493
AND SO THAT'S A SLIGHT REDUCTION

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.428
BUTTON WITH ACCOUNTABILITY

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:39.228
INFIDELITY WE THINK THAT WE CAN

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.797
ACHIEVE NATIONAL PERCENTAGES

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.732
WHICH IS CLOSE TO TWELVE AND 13%

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:43.933
FOR CBT PROGRAMS.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:44.967
THERE WAS ALSO A REFERENCE OR

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.235
EDUCATION PROGRAMS PEOPLE

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:48.071
ACHIEVING THE LITERACY LEVEL

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.072
THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT WHICH

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.440
IS A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:51.574
EQUIVALENCY.

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:54.143
AND IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.645
POPULATION IT WAS RELEASED WE

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:57.213
SAW ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.815
FROM SOME INITIAL DATA THAT'S

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.116
ABOUT NINE POINT 5%.

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:02.819
NOW WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:03.386
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHICH IS NOT

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:03.953
APPLES TO APPLES BUT IT'S A

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.021
STARTING POINT TO DISCUSS HOW

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.456
SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE.

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:07.957
IT'S AROUND 18% SO THAT'S NOT A

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:10.860
50% RIGHT THE LITERACY THAT WE

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:12.228
THINK -- ARE

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:13.196
ACHIEVABLE AND WHAT WE'RE AIMING

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:14.764
FOR SO WE'RE SEEING BITS AND

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:17.033
PIECES OF RECIDIVISM REDUCTIONS

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.501
FOR THE THINGS WERE POINT BUT WE

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.236
A 100% CONCUR THAT WE NEED TO

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:21.003
CONTINUE.

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.605
FOCUSING ON DATA COLLECTION

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:24.841
EXTRACTION AND EVALUATIONS NOT

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:25.975
FOR HIM INFORMACIóN SO WHAT'S

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.910
WITH THE PLAN TO GET TO THAT 20%

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:30.379
HOW TO CLOSE THAT 20% GAP.

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:31.681
THE INITIAL PLAN IS

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:33.015
IMPLEMENTATION WITH ENOUGH

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.450
LONGITUDINAL DATA.

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:35.418
AND THEN IMPLEMENT REALLY

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:36.319
ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:37.720
MEASURES PUT IN PLACE THE STUFF

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.188
THAT WE'VE WORKED WITH WHICH WAS

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.556
REFERENCED IN THE AUDIT ON AND

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:41.991
WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED TO THE

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.059
MEMBERS.

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:43.659
WHICH IS OUR WORK WITH

01:02:43.726 --> 01:02:45.061
pUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:46.429
THEY CREATED AROUND OUR

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:47.763
COGNITIVE BE REAL TREATMENT --

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.599
COMPONENTS REALLY ACCOUNTABILITY

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.200
INFIDELITY TOOLS AND MEASURES

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:52.135
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.769
AT AND FIDELITY IS A VERY

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:54.604
CRITICAL --

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:55.905
PIECE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:57.907
ACHIEVING RECIDIVISM REDUCTION

01:02:57.974 --> 01:02:59.041
AND THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.643
NATIONALLY AS WELL AND I THINK

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.312
JUST A NOTE EARLIER WE HAVE A A

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.046
ROD.

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:04.680
BRANDT --

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.249
DIRECTOR CHOKE MENTIONED THAT WE

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:07.850
HAVE A BROAD ARRAY OF

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:10.052
PROGRAMMING THAT IS SO IMPORTANT

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:10.620
TO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:13.055
POPULATION EVERYTHING FROM C. B.

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:15.158
T. AND EDUCATION BUT ALSO.

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:15.858
OUR COMMUNITY BASED

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.927
ORGANIZATIONS THAT COME IN AND

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.562
DO OUR GRANT PROGRAMS INTO OUR

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.997
VOLUNTARY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:23.065
THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS CONSIDERED

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:24.033
TO BE EVIDENCE BASED OUR

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.401
RESEARCH AS DEFINED IN THE FEW

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:26.269
CLEARING HOUSE BUT THE STUFF

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.270
THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.639
CREATES A CULTURE AND

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:30.206
ENVIRONMENT WE THINK IN THE

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:32.808
PRISON BRING THOSE OUTPUT

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:34.510
MEASURES AND OUTCOME MEASURES SO

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:35.244
IT'S NOT ALWAYS JUST ABOUT

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:36.712
RECIDIVISM WERE LOOKING FOR IS

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:37.980
DELIVERABLES TO SHOW.

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:39.215
MAYBE CHANGES IN THE POPULATION

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.516
CHANGES AND HOW THEY'RE REACTING

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:41.984
TO PROGRAMMING THE ABILITY TO

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:43.152
GET PREPARED FOR TREATMENT

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.787
PROGRAM IN WHICH OPENS UP SOME

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:46.055
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.657
TRAUMA WOUNDS THAT WE NEED TO

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:48.858
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE READY TO

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.259
ACCOUNT FOR AND HAVE THEM THERE

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:51.394
AND A BIG PIECE OF WHAT WE'VE

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.662
DONE TO WITH --

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:53.896
THE STUFF THAT WE WORKED ON THE

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.164
LAST YEAR'S REALLY DID ANALYTICS

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.566
TOOLS MAKING SURE OUR PSALMS

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:58.334
WEIGHTLESS PRIORITIZES RISK AND

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.769
NEEDS CREATING DATA ANALYTICS

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:00.703
TOOLS TO MAKE SURE GETTING

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:01.470
PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT PROGRAM AT

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:02.638
THE RIGHT TIME.

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:04.507
SO ALL THINGS I CONCUR WITH YOU

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:05.641
WHEN WE NEED TO KEEP FOCUSING ON

01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:07.210
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:08.177
SHOW THAT WERE RID --

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:10.112
YOU KNOW REDUCING OUTPUTS AND

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:11.147
OUTCOMES AS NECESSARY AND THAT'S

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:12.748
RICH PRODUCTIONS AND RECIDIVISM

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:14.483
AND OTHER THINGS AS WELL HOW HOW

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.319
LONG TO IMPLEMENT THESE TOOLS.

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:17.420
WELL THE LAST TWO YEARS WE

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:18.287
REALLY CREATED ALL OF THEM SO

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.121
IT'S REALLY ROLLING THEM OUT AND

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:19.989
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.290
THE RIGHT REPORTING BACK.

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:22.191
THE WORK THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:23.893
WITH RESEARCHERS IS REALLY

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.528
TRYING TO FIND THINGS THAT WE

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:26.862
KNOW THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:28.464
SEE AND THINGS WE BELIEVE IN WE

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.498
ARE ABSOLUTE PASSION ABOUT THE

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:30.333
PROGRAMS ARE PUTTING IN PLACE

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:31.467
AND WE KNOW THEY CAN HAVE THESE

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:32.735
RECIDIVISM A FAX.

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.704
SO WE PLAN ON BEING IN CONTRACT

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.005
CONSISTENT WITH THE AUDIT REPORT

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:37.940
BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:38.874
WORKING TOWARDS DELIVERABLES

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:42.445
THEY'RE NOT JUST LONGITUDINAL

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:44.113
BUT MAYBE SOME OTHER ONES.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.448
SO WHEN YOU SAY ROLL OUT WHAT

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:46.782
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SO HOW HOW MANY

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:47.416
HOW MANY FACILITIES.

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.352
HAVE THEM HOW MANY PROGRAMS HAVE

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:50.019
THEM AND WHAT WHICH ONES DON'T.

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:50.753
FOR THE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:51.821
INFIDELITY TOOLS YES SO

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:53.789
ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS ROLLED OUT

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:54.690
IN JANUARY AND ALL --

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.926
CHAPTER NINETEEN JANUARY TWO

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:58.628
THOUSAND TWO WAS CREATED IN TWO

01:04:58.694 --> 01:04:59.262
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WITH

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:00.396
UC IRVINE PERSON TRAINING BEING

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.597
DONE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE GOING

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:02.865
TO BE DOING IT RIGHT BECAUSE

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.300
PART OF WHAT WE WANTED TO DO AND

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:05.067
HERE HE WAS CRITICIZED ANIMAL

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:05.735
MODEL.

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.536
NOT HAVE TO ALWAYS PAY A

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:10.573
RESEARCHER A FEW INSTITUTIONS

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.841
BUT REALLY BE ABLE TO PUT

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:12.975
SOMETHING IN BROADLY.

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.176
AND SO THE ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.911
ROLLED ON JANUARY AND OUR STAFF

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:16.712
ARE GOING OUT AND DOING

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:17.847
ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEWS NOW

01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:19.448
THEY'RE ALSO BEING TRAINED ON

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:20.716
THE FIDELITY MEASUREMENTS.

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:21.851
THEIR WORK CREATIVITY IS HEREBY

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:24.253
ANOTHER HAPPENING OKAY MUSIC

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.087
ROLLOUT.

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:25.921
ALL THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:27.423
OKAY SO EVERY EVERY INSTITUTION

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.324
NOW.

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.259
HOW'S THE TOOLS DEVELOPED BY UC

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:31.093
IRVINE.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.628
AND NOW YOUR TEAM IS GOING IN

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:34.697
THERE TO DOUBLE CHECK TO MAKE

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.299
SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEING.

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:37.867
AND IT ISN'T AT THE DATA IS

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:38.868
BEING COLLECTED THAT'S CORRECT.

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:40.102
YES COLLECTED IN IMPLEMENTED

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:41.771
WITH FIDELITY IMPLEMENTED AS THE

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:43.606
MODEL HAD INTENDED IN TERMS TO

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:44.974
DATE HOW FOR YOU GETTING DID YOU

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:46.042
GET IN WEEKLY.

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.144
MONTHLY WE ARE COLLECTING

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:49.679
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MILLIONS

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:50.980
OF DATA POINTS YOUR EVERY WEEK

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:52.415
EVERYBODY THAT IS INVOLVED IN

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:53.716
OUR PROGRAMMING --

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:54.984
ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALLY TRY

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:56.652
TO FOCUS ON A LAST YEAR'S AS WE

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:58.287
DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE RESEARCHERS

01:05:58.354 --> 01:05:59.588
COME IN AND NOT HAVE THE DATA WE

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:01.290
OFTEN SEE THAT'S A PROBLEM WITH.

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:02.591
WITH THESE RECIDIVISM REPORTS OR

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:03.959
ANYTHING AS THEY SAY WE JUST

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:05.027
DON'T HAVE THE DATA AVAILABLE SO

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:06.762
OUR TEAM FOCUSED REALLY ON

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:07.563
CREATING --

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.898
STRATEGIC OFFENDER MANAGEMENT

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:10.299
SYSTEM DATAPOINTS EVERYTHING

01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:11.701
FROM TRACKING WHEN THEY WERE

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:12.968
ASSIGNED A PROGRAM HOW MUCH

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:14.070
THEY'VE BEEN ASSIGNED A PROGRAM

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:14.837
HOW MANY HOURS ARE IN THE

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:15.538
PROGRAM.

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:16.906
WE ALSO ROLLED OUT AT A ROBUST

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:18.674
CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO WE'RE

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:19.675
DOING FIDELITY MEASUREMENTS WE

01:06:19.742 --> 01:06:21.177
KNOW WHAT CURRICULUM THEY'RE

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:22.712
WORKING ON ON WHAT DAY AND THE

01:06:22.778 --> 01:06:23.846
TREATMENT NOTES IN CASE PLAN

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.381
SURROUNDING IT SO WE REALLY TRY

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:26.282
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:27.917
THE INFORMATION IS THERE SO THAT

01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:28.651
WHEN WE EXTRACTED FOR THESE

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:30.586
FIDELITY REPORTS OR FOR THE

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:31.487
RESEARCHERS THE REALLY GONNA

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:35.291
HAVE A REAL FAST --

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:35.925
VARIETY OF INFORMATION THAT THEY

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:39.095
CAN GET FOR CAN YOU SHARE THAT

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:39.395
WITH US NOW.

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:40.796
ABSOLUTELY.

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:43.699
AND THEN.

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:46.102
GIVE GIVEN THIS IS A WAY OUT OF

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:47.603
THIS DOES THIS. TO THESE

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.705
EVALUATION THE AN AUDITOR DO

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.006
THESE EVALUATION TOOLS --

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:52.575
CHECK THAT BOX IN TERMS OF YOUR

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:54.577
RECOMMENDATION OR ARE YOU

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:56.045
EXPECTING MORE THAN THIS.

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:57.012
THINK WE NEED TO SEE EXACTLY

01:06:57.079 --> 01:07:00.049
WHAT INCLUDED IN THESE REPORTS --

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:00.983
ONE TO GET IN YOUR MENTION WAS

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:03.018
TALK ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:03.619
THE PROGRAMS AND COMPARING THE

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:04.520
COST EFFECTIVENESS BETWEEN THE

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.255
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO SEE WHICH

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:08.290
ONES MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE --

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:09.024
WE HAD ALSO HOPE THAT --

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:10.926
IT EVALUATION WOULD INCLUDE A

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.129
COMPONENT THAT WOULD.

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:13.729
ALLOW US TO SEE WHAT THE GAPS

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:14.663
ARE.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.232
AND SEE WHETHER THE OR OTHER

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:20.369
PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE NEEDED TO

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:24.173
ADDRESS THOSE GAPS.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:24.740
ANTHONY SYMBOL FROM ELLIE I

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:25.374
DON'T THINK I'D ADD IS AS THEY

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:26.342
WERE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.276
RECIDIVISM REDUCTION DATA IT'S A

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:28.110
THINK ABOUT THE POPULATION THAT

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:28.744
THEY'RE TARGETING AS THE AUTHOR

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:29.745
NOTED IN THEIR REPORT AS WE'VE

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:30.679
NOTED.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:32.381
THE FARM HAS ALWAYS PART OF THE

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:35.317
HIGH SORT OF THE LOW RISK OF

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:36.852
NONI SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:38.587
THEIR THEIR PRESENTING IN THAT

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:39.455
LIGHT IN OTHER WORDS ARE THERE

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.923
FOR REALLY FOCUSING MORE ON HIGH

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.957
RISK HIGH NEED.

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:43.659
WELL WITH THOSE OUTCOMES THE

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:44.727
KLAXON ONE THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:47.863
SO THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.799
SO DO YOU BREAK OUT THE ON THE

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:51.267
DATA BASED ON THE TYPE OF

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:51.767
INDIVIDUAL THE SERVICE.

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:54.036
YEAH WE ARE WE ARE NOW FOCUSING

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:55.237
I THINK WITH THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:56.772
A PRIORITIZATION AFFECTING THE

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:57.773
DEPARTMENT TO FOCUS ON HIGH RISK

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.041
HIGH NEED BUT IT'S BEEN A REALLY

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.476
MANUAL PROCESS.

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:01.744
SO TWO YEARS AGO WE GOT TOGETHER

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:02.845
SOMEHOW WE LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.014
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND THAT WAS

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.449
PSALMS WEIGHTLESS CHANGES ARE

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:07.550
DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS WE PUT IN

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:08.984
PLACE. TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE

01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:10.653
NEEDS OF THE POPULATION THAT CAN

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:11.687
BE -- YOU

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:13.088
KNOW BASS ADDRESSED THROUGH

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:14.457
RECIDIVISM REDUCTION THAT'S

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:16.425
HIGHEST RISK AND HIGHEST NEED

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:17.760
BASED ON OUR TOOLS.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:18.294
THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.495
AMOUNT OF PROGRAMMING GOING ON

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:20.963
BEHIND THE SCENES IN OUR PSALMS

01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:22.932
DATA SYSTEM AND SO THE NEW

01:08:22.998 --> 01:08:25.267
VERSION WILL COME LIVE ON APRIL

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.503
SEVENTH TO BE ABLE. TO TO

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.805
ACCOMMODATE THE A BETTER WAITING

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:31.774
LISTS THAT.

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:33.876
THE TOP PLACE PEOPLE ON THEIR

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.846
HIGH RISK AND I NEED.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.414
AND I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT WE DO

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:39.982
HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.116
TOOLS AVAILABLE UC IRVINE THAT

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.818
CITIES HERE IMPLEMENT THEM AS

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.720
WELL AS THE WAITLIST ISSUE --

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.055
SO WE'LL BE FOLLOWING THAT UP --

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.556
THERE'S CITIES HERE SIXTY DAY

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:48.757
RESPONSES DID WAS AT THE END OF

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:50.459
THE MONTH SO WILL BEGIN IN THE

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:51.460
DOCUMENTATION OF THAT

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:53.996
IMPLEMENTATION AT THE END WE CAN

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:56.198
KIND OF MAKE JUDGMENTS ON WHERE

01:08:56.265 --> 01:09:00.069
THEY ARE IN THAT PROCESS. ONE OF

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:02.004
THE THANK A A CHEER OF FOR THE

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.673
QUESTIONS IT WOULD GIVE ME A LOT

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.976
LESS TO ASK.

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.978
LOOK NO NO THAT'S GREAT THAT'S

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:09.912
WONDERFUL --

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:10.779
THAT'S GREAT --

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:13.649
IT APPEARS THAT.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:15.684
WHO IMPLEMENTS THE PROGRAMS DO

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:17.753
YOU HAVE THE [inaudible]

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:18.888
PERSONNEL.

01:09:18.954 --> 01:09:21.123
OF CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING THESE

01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:22.658
PROGRAMS WITH THE FIDELITY THAT

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:23.959
YOU TALK ABOUT.

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:25.494
I MEAN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:27.696
RESEARCH BASED PROGRAMS AND I'M

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.698
LISTENING TO FOLKS SAY BUT WITH

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.333
THE FIDELITY WHICH MEANS YOU

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.635
ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:34.303
IT AND AND IMPLEMENTED BY THEM.

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:35.604
BY THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.339
IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO BE THERE

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.041
DO WE HAVE THE STAFF TO DO THAT --

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:41.377
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPEAR IS IF.

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:43.012
THE WE HAVE A STAFF IN PLACE TO

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:44.146
COMPENSATE BECAUSE THE FOCUS

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:45.948
SEEM TO BE ON GETTING MORE

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.516
PROGRAMS GETTING LOTS OF

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.852
PROGRAMS BUT NOT NECESSARILY

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.787
ALWAYS GETTING THE RIGHT PROGRAM

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.656
IMPLEMENT IT THE RIGHT WAY --

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:56.091
SO DO WE HAVE THE STAFF TO DO

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:57.860
THAT ARE YOU IN THE PROCESS OF

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.695
HIRING FOLKS TO DO THAT WE

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:00.262
BELIEVE THAT WE DO HAVE THE

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:01.163
STAFF TO DO THAT.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.431
THE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:03.566
TRY TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.701
MODEL WITH UC IRVINE WAS TO MAKE

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:06.869
SURE THAT OUR STAFF ARE FOCUSED

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:07.836
ON THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:09.138
SO ROLL OUT.

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:10.172
OF OUR CONTRACTS WAS A

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.340
SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING IT TAKES

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:13.309
A LOT OF ON DAY TO DAY TASKS

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.076
WORK BUT NOW THAT THAT'S BEEN

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:16.178
ACCOMPLISHED WE'VE REALLY RE

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:17.479
DIRECTED THE STAFF TO SAY WITH

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:18.614
YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.449
FACTORS IN MAKING SURE THAT.

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:21.317
OUR TREATMENTS WORKING AS THOSE

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:22.651
THAT WOULD BE MEASURES AND SO

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.186
RIGHT NOW WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:25.688
THE ABILITY TO DO THAT --

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:28.524
ON AND THE IDEA IS TWO TO THREE

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:31.961
TIMES WE HAVE SO WE'RE NOT HE

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:32.995
JUST GETTING ONE FIDELITY

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.229
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE WE'RE

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:34.830
GETTING MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:35.698
OVER A YEAR.

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.099
SO RESEARCHERS ARE ALSO ABLE TO

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:39.401
LOOK AT THAT AND IF WE ARE FOR

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:40.869
SOME REASON ARE.

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:42.237
NOT ABLE TO ARE STRUGGLING WE

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.439
WOULD OBVIOUSLY TO WORK WITH THE

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:44.206
ADMINISTRATION --

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:45.908
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:46.875
RIGHT NOW WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:49.178
ENOUGH SO YOU BEGIN THE PROCESS

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:50.346
YOU SAID YOU BECAME AWARE OF

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:54.250
THIS PROBLEM AND AND TWENTY

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:56.418
SEVENTEEN OKAY AND AS A RESULT

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:58.020
OF THAT YOU BEGAN TO DO. TO MAKE

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.888
CHANGES.

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:01.590
OKAY BUT THEY WERE NOT READY BY

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.092
THE TIME HE DID THE REPORT IS

01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:05.060
THAT CORRECT.

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:07.563
A LOT OF THE THAT MUST EARN.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:09.698
A LOT OF WHAT WE TRY TO DO IN

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:10.232
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:11.367
REALLY ASSESS WHY.

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:12.401
THAT THE REASONS THAT PROGRAMS

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:13.535
WOULDN'T WORK OR WOULDN'T BE

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:14.870
SHOWN TO WORK OR SOME OF THE

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:15.904
STRUGGLES WE HAD THOSE WERE

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:17.806
REALLY AROUND MAKING SURE THAT

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:18.807
WE HAD DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:19.475
UNDER WAY.

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:21.010
MAKING SURE WE WERE BOTH PUTTING

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:22.611
THINGS INTO THE CRACKS SYSTEMS

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:23.245
AND BEING ABLE TO EXTRACT THOSE

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:25.214
THINGS OUT CREATING AND STARTING

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.582
TO WORK WITH OUR STRATEGIC

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:27.950
OFFENDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:28.884
MAKE SURE THOSE PRIVATIZATIONS

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:29.418
WERE RIGHT.

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:30.886
AND ALSO OUR DATA ANALYTICS

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.187
TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:34.556
ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.190
PERSON THE RIGHT PROGRAM IN THE

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:36.258
RIGHT TIME.

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:37.326
ALL OF THOSE THINGS REALLY WERE

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:38.293
IN PLACE BECAUSE WHAT WE DIDN'T

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.395
WANT TO SOME LONGITUDINAL

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.596
RESEARCH STUDY.

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:41.697
THAT CAME OUT AND SAID WELL

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:42.998
YOU'RE PUTTING THE WRONG PERSON

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:44.066
AND SO WE WOULD GO BACK AND GO

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.100
OH WELL NOW WHEN YOU PUT THE

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.001
RIGHT PERSON AND FOR THAT

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:46.268
RESEARCH.

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:47.936
THAT WAS THE EFFORT HERE THE

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.171
LAST YEAR'S REALLY SAYING MAKE

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.606
SURE WE PUT THE FOUNDATION

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:52.241
TOGETHER CORRECTLY MAKE SURE WE

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:53.175
HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S GOING

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:54.043
TO BE THERE MAKE SURE WE HAVE A

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.177
FIDELITY THERE.

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.812
SO WHEN THE RESEARCH COMES TO

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:59.214
FRUITION WERE ABLE BECAUSE THEY

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.816
WORK NATIONALLY WE KNOW THAT

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.484
THEY WORK THE ONLY WORK IF THE

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.385
RIGHT PEOPLE TO PUT THEM

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:04.853
TOGETHER THAT'S CORRECT ONLY

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.888
WORK IF THE RIGHT FOLKS IN THE

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:06.422
CLASSROOM --

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:07.456
WHATEVER TEACHING YOU KNOW IT'S

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:09.658
NOT SOMETHING JUST HAS TO EXIST

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:10.492
ON A BOOK COULD YOU TAKE OFF THE

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:12.127
SHELF AND THEN IT BECOMES A GOOD

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.062
PROGRAM.

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.430
IT HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.931
RIGHT WAY WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.132
OF STAFF.

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:19.735
THE RIGHT FOLKS THAT ARE THERE --

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.937
SO I HOPE I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.806
THAT THE REASON WHY OF COURSE

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.140
WERE ASKING QUESTIONS --

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:26.308
WOULD BE SPENT A HALF A BILLION

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.676
DOLLARS OF REHABILITATION THIS

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:29.545
PAST COUPLE YEARS WITH THE HOPES

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.447
THAT IT WOULD OF IMPROVE THE

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:33.749
LIVES OF THE OF THE THE INMATES

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:35.350
THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BENEFIT

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:36.285
FROM IT.

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:37.720
AND THAT THE THE CONCEPT OF

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:39.221
REHABILITATION THAT'S IN THE

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.923
NAME OF THE ALL OF THE AGENCY

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:43.325
NOW IS A REALITY RATHER THAN

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:45.394
JUST A NAME AND SO --

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:47.096
WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT OUT I

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:48.731
THINK VISITING ASKED A VERY GOOD

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:49.531
QUESTION --

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:51.567
AND AND MAYBE WE SHOULD WHY

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:53.135
SHOULD WE CONTINUE THE PROGRAMS

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.503
THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:56.905
YOU KNOW 80% OF THEM I GUESS ARE

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.207
EFFECTIVE IS THAT CORRECT OR

01:12:58.273 --> 01:12:59.942
HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITH SOME

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:00.809
FIDELITY.

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:04.446
SO.

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.247
ARE ALL REPORT DOESN'T.

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:06.682
RECOMMEND ANY REDUCTION IN

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:06.982
BRIGHTON --

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:07.883
IN THE PROGRAMS THIS TIME

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:08.684
BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T FEEL

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:10.085
THAT THEY'VE BEEN TESTED

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.420
THOROUGHLY TO KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:13.422
THEY TRULY ARE OKAY SO WE THINK

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:15.491
THAT'S WHY CECE'S HERE NEEDS --

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:16.358
TO CONTRACT WITH AN OUTSIDE

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:17.860
RESEARCH IT'S INDEED DO THAT

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.428
LIKE WORK AND THEN YOU'RE REALLY

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:20.796
EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS TO NOW

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:21.764
YOU KNOW WHAT --

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.499
WHAT PROGRAMS ARE WORKING AND

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.767
YOU REALLY WANT TO EXPAND THOSE

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:25.701
THAT FOCUS ON THEM AND THEN WHAT

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:28.270
PROGRAMS MAYBE AREN'T AS

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:28.904
EFFECTIVE AND BEGIN THAT CUTTING

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:29.271
BUT [inaudible]

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:31.306
AT THAT.

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:34.343
NOW YOU SAID ABOUT 80% SEEM TO

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:34.510
BE.

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:37.412
OF EVIDENCE BASIS FOR AND BEING

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:38.881
IMPLEMENTED AS SOON WITH SOME OF

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:40.849
THE DELL E. IS THAT CORRECT OR

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.217
JUST IT.

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:43.519
IF I HAVE IT IN SPACE SO --

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:46.321
AT THE TIME OF OUR WORKED WITH

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:47.623
YOU SEE OR BY TO DEVELOP THOSE

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:48.991
FIDELITY TOOLS HOWEVER THEY

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.526
WEREN'T IMPLEMENTED AT THE TIME

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:52.895
OF OUR WORK NOW SO.

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.363
SO I THINK AS THEY MOVE FORWARD

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:55.831
AND WHAT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT AS

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:57.166
THAT SIXTY SIX MONTH OF ONE YOUR

01:13:57.232 --> 01:14:00.035
RESPONSES IS TO SEE OUT OF WHAT.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.570
OF REPORTS THEY'RE GETTING BACK

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:03.272
CONCERNING HOW WELL THESE

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:04.907
PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY BEING --

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:08.143
INSURE CONSISTENTLY TAUGHT IN

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:10.245
APPLIED ACROSS THE STATE.

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:11.246
I THINK THE CLOSER YES GO HEAD I

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:11.747
THINK CONTACT IS REALLY

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:12.381
IMPORTANT AS WELL THAT THE THE

01:14:12.447 --> 01:14:14.983
STATE AUDITOR WAS ONLY FOCUSED

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.818
ON OUR COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.352
TREATMENT PROGRAMS RIGHT THAT

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:18.854
WAS THE THE REDUCTIONS IN

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.289
RECIDIVISM DISCUSSION.

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:21.423
AND I THINK TWO OF THE TEN

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.625
INSTITUTIONS ACTUALLY DID SHOW --

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:24.526
POSITIVE REDUCTIONS IN

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:26.161
RECIDIVISM FOR THOSE TEN THAT

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:28.263
THEY REVIEWED BUT THE 76% AS

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.032
NOTED IN AUDIT REPORT OUR

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:31.433
EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOCUS ON

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.936
LITERACY AND JUST LIKE I SAID --

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:35.037
A MINUTE AGO AND SECRETARY DS

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:36.905
DISCUSS THAT AS WELL JUST ON A

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:37.773
ONE YEAR CONVICTION RATE WE'RE

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.274
SEEING POTENTIALLY UP 250%

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:40.843
REDUCTIONS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:41.844
ACHIEVING THEIR HIGH SCHOOL

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:42.945
DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT THE SO

01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:44.346
THESE ARE THINGS WE KNOW AS WE

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:45.781
GO FORWARD WITH OUR OUR RESEARCH

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:46.815
PROJECTS BOTH.

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:48.584
HOLISTICALLY THE VERY LARGE ONES

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.685
AND SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:50.252
CAN DO WITH OUR OFFICE OF

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.520
RESEARCH THESE ARE THINGS WE CAN

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.188
PROVIDE TO THE COMMITTEE.

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:55.290
THAT WILL HELP --

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:58.160
PROVIDE A MORE ABILITY SINCE

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.661
WORKING BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.330
THAT IT IS WORKING EDUCATION

01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:02.164
THERE ARE SOME INDICATORS RIGHT

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:03.031
NOW THAT SHOW THAT.

01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:05.500
AND NATIONALLY SUBSTANCE USE

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:06.468
TREATMENT AND OTHER COGNITIVE

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:08.136
HERO TREATMENT WORKS UP TO YOU

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:09.538
KNOW ON WITH A FEW RESULTS FIRST

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.740
CLEARING HOUSE 13% REDUCTIONS IN

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:13.475
RECIDIVISM SO WE BELIEVE THAT

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:14.543
PUTTING THESE FOUNDATIONAL

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:15.744
MEASURES IN PLACE WILL REALLY

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:17.246
HELP US ACHIEVE THOSE REDUCTIONS

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:18.380
AND BE ABLE TO MEASURE MOST WE

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:20.949
GO. FOR WITH THIS LONGITUDINAL

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:24.353
RESEARCH STUDY.

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:25.787
OKAY -- YES

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:27.155
JUST ONE OTHER SHOULD THINK

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:27.756
ABOUT AS THE DEPARTMENT TALKS

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.958
ABOUT ITS EVALUATION PLAN

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.326
WORKING FOR OUTSIDE RESEARCHERS

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:32.728
HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED HOW MUCH

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:33.896
THAT WOULD COST.

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:34.563
AND HOW THEY PLAN ON PAYING FACE

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:35.564
IS GONNA COME WITHIN THEIR

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:36.665
BUDGET IS GOING TO COME WITHIN

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:38.567
THE REHABILITATION BUDGET AND

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:39.835
WHICH PROGRAM SERVICES WITH A

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:42.437
NOT DUE TO FIND THE EVALUATION

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:42.971
THAT'S ONE THING HAPPENED

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.773
MENTIONED.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.340
WHICH I GUESS WOULD BE VERY

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:46.241
IMPORTANT.

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:47.976
IF YOU AND TAKING A MAJOR

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.444
EVALUATION ASSESSMENT.

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.480
OF THE OF THE PROPER PROGRAM

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:53.548
MAYBE A FACTOR THAT IN.

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:55.117
WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THE

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:56.818
GENERAL SIZE OF THE EVALUATION

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.186
THEY CAN BE VERY COSTLY AND

01:15:58.253 --> 01:16:00.389
WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OPTIONS

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:01.556
ABOUT --

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:02.357
TRYING TO BE FISCALLY

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:03.892
RESPONSIBLE WITH THAT AND SO

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:04.893
THERE ARE SOME THINGS OUT THERE

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.261
WORKING WITH NON PROFITS IS ALSO

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:07.329
AN OPTION WE'RE DOING SOME

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:08.497
THINGS BUT OBVIOUSLY.

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:10.832
IF THERE WAS A REQUESTED WE

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:11.466
WOULD DO THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:12.234
PROCESS AS WELL.

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.368
I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT ARE

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:14.636
THERE ARE FEDERAL --

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.071
GRANTS AVAILABLE --

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:16.471
THE STATEWIDE --

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:19.841
RECIDIVISM REDUCTION FIVE GIVES

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.376
A SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS TO

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:22.711
STATES OVER A COURSE OF SEVERAL

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:24.813
YEARS IF THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE A

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.181
PLAN TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.316
SAID SOMETHING THAT CITIES ARE

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:30.852
COULD LOOK INTO AS WELL.

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:32.854
ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS.

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:33.956
WE CAN PROBABLY TAKE PUBLIC

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.357
COMMENTS NOW SINCE WOULD DEAL

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.959

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INITIATE

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:01.783
JUSTICE AND WHERE POLICY LED

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:03.385
ORGANIZATION BUILT BY AND FOR

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:04.486
PEOPLE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.388
INCARCERATION --

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:07.689
I'M HERE AS PART OF THAT

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:09.458
TRANSFORMATIVE IN PRISON WORK

01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:10.325
GROUP --

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:11.994
THEY'RE LESS MEMBERS HERE TODAY --

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.328
BUT I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:14.930
OUR TWELVE THOUSAND CURRENTLY

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:17.366
INCARCERATED MEMBERS --

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:18.400
I'M HERE TO MAKE THREE SHORT

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:18.967
POINTS --

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:20.235
FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO IMPRESS

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.737
UPON THIS BODY THE FACT THAT

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:23.939
INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE BEGGING

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:26.908
FOR ACCESS TO UP TO MORE ACCESS

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.677
TO BETTER MORE TRANSFORMATIVE IN

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:30.145
PRISON GROUPS --

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:31.913
AND PROGRAMS WE CONDUCTED A

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.482
SURVEY LAST YEAR MORE THAN A

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:35.083
THOUSAND PEOPLE AND ASK THEM TO

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:36.318
RANK OUT OF TEN POLICY

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:37.786
PRIORITIES WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.287
PRIORITIZING AND THEY RANKED

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:40.989
ACCESS TO BETTER PROGRAMS AS

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:42.324
NUMBER --

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:43.492
TWO THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.226
TO RAISE IS THAT INCREASED

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:46.261
ACCESS COMES WITH INCREASED

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:47.596
FUNDING --

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:49.297
WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THIS

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:50.832
BODY ALLOCATE TEN MILLION

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:51.767
DOLLARS TO COMMUNITY BASED

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:54.970
ORGANIZATIONS AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:57.305
CURRENT RECOMMENDED FOR MILLION

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.940
OF THE ALMOST TWELVE BILLION

01:17:59.007 --> 01:17:59.541
DOLLAR BUDGET IS REALLY NOT A

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:00.108
LOT.

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:00.542
AND THEN THE THIRD

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:02.110
RECOMMENDATION THAT I WOULD MAKE

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.012
IS THAT WHEN IN THE FUTURE

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:06.048
YOU'RE DOING YOUR RESEARCH ON

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:07.149
LOOKING AT COMMUNITY BASED

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:08.250
ORGANIZATIONS --

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:09.684
WHICH ARE DISTINCT FROM THE

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:11.353
COGNITIVE BASED THERAPY PROGRAMS

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.755
RUN BY CDC ARE CONSIDERED THE

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.157
IMPACT ON PEOPLE --

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:17.025

PROGRAMS OR MAYBE PEOPLE WHO ARE --

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:21.096
ON PAROLE REENTERING IN THEIR

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:22.597
COMMUNITY SAFELY WHAT ACTUALLY

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:23.698
HELP TO THEM --

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.100
LOOKING AT RECIDIVISM AND YOU

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:26.134
KNOW ALL THESE NUMBERS ARE

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:27.402
IMPORTANT BUT THE ANECDOTAL

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:28.970
EVIDENCE I'M HEARING FROM THE

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:30.305
PEOPLE MOST DIRECTLY IMPACT IN

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:31.273
WHO HAVE PARTICIPATE IN THESE

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:33.508
PROGRAMS AS IMPORTANT AS WELL.

ILL TAGS OF THE COMMUNITY RAN

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:48.370
GROUPS AND FROM THE C. B. TWO

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:50.272
GROUPS THAT ARE HAVE BEEN

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:52.040

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:52.874
TODAY.

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:54.843
WHAT IT'LL TAKE GROUPS CAN DO

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.678
THAT CBT GROUPS CANNOT ARE THREE

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.613
THINGS SPECIFICALLY ONE BECAUSE

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.148
WE AND SUCCESS STORIES WERE OF

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.650
THE PEOPLE WE WERE WORKING WITH

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:03.451
WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THE NEEDS --

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:05.020
THAT PEOPLE HAD IN A WAY THAT

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.087
WAS DIFFERENT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE

01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:08.323
THAT PEOPLE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:09.291
THIRTY FIVE NOT ONLY RECIDIVIST

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.325
AT HIGHER BUT GOT INTO MORE

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:11.493
TROUBLE AND COMMITTED MORE

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:12.894
VIOLENCE WITHIN PRISON.

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:13.895
BECAUSE WE ARE IN THESE GROUPS

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:16.031
OUT IN THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE LAST

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:16.631
TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD I STARTED

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.500
THE PROGRAM. TO WE WERE ABLE TO

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:21.169
INTERVENE AND MORE DIRECT WAYS --

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:22.237
THAT ARE A LITTLE HARDER TO

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:23.538
STUDY THAN JUST RECIDIVISM FOR

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.073
EXAMPLE WE STOPPED MANY FIGHTS

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.441
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN.

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.143
BECAUSE WE WERE AMONG THE PEER

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:30.845
GROUP OF THE OF OUR PARTICIPANTS

01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:32.681
I WAS NOT A MANDATORY REPORTER I

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.349
DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL THE COPS

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:35.917
WHEN SOMEBODY HAD A CELL PHONE I

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.752
COULD DEAL WITH THEM DIRECTLY --

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:39.087
AND WE WERE ABLE TO STOP A LOT

01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:42.557
OF IMPRISONED BYLANDT BY BEING

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:43.124
OF THE COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:43.625
WORKING WITH.

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:46.261
THIRD AND FINALLY --

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:48.229
WE WERE WE BUILT WE BUILT

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.631
RELATIONSHIPS AUTHENTIC

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:50.832
RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE PRISON

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.701
WHICH IS VERY HARD TO MEASURE IN

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:54.102
A QUANTITATIVE WAY --

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:57.205
BUT WE HAD REALIZED THAT PEOPLE

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:58.506
WERE COMMITTING VIOLENCE BECAUSE

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:03.411
THEY SAW VIOLENCE AS A AS PART

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:04.979
OF BEING A MAN.

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.749
AND WE REMEDY THAT BY BUILDING

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:08.783
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WERE NOT

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:09.584
BASED IN VIOLENT AGAIN

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:10.985
MEMBERSHIP BUT ACTUAL

01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:12.287
RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT SOMETHING

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:13.621
THAT COULD ONLY HAPPEN WHEN

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:15.023
THERE'S NO POWER DYNAMIC.

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:16.658
ON THAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS IN THE

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:17.859
C. B. T. GROUPS WHERE YOU HAVE A

ISN'T JUST ABOUT RECIDIVISM

01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:27.654
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR

01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:28.455
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:29.723
INDICATOR OF A SUCCESSFUL

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:31.425
PROGRAM -- I

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:33.293
THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OTHER

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.262
PRO SOCIAL FACTORS ARE PEOPLE

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:36.797
MORE CONNECTED TO THEIR FAMILIES

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:38.465
ARE THERE DIFFERENT RACE

THE BEST PROGRAMS IN CDC ARE --

01:40:49.009 --> 01:40:50.511
BUT I THINK ADDITIONALLY FOR

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:53.547
CULTURE THE CULTURE AROUND --

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:55.082
THE PROGRAMMING IS AROUND

LOCKDOWNS ARE FORMALLY

01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:57.818
INCARCERATED PEOPLE ALLOWED INTO

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:01.755

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:03.657
TO THEIR PARTICIPATION --

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:05.426
HOW ARE THE GUARDS TREATING THE

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:13.133
INNOVATIVE?

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.735

01:41:14.802 --> 01:41:16.904
THE RESOURCES TO NECESSARILY BE

EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM COMING

IMPORTANCE OF I'M A METRIC OF

01:46:55.876 --> 01:46:57.344
RECIDIVISM --

01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:59.346
BECAUSE IS IT.

01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:01.882
IT IS THE FINAL PRODUCT OF ALL

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:02.482
THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:03.383
ABOUT.

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:03.950
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:05.585
ABOUT A PERSON WHO IS WHOLE

01:47:05.652 --> 01:47:07.287
AGAIN WHO'S DEALING WITH THE

01:47:07.354 --> 01:47:08.555
ISSUES THAT GOT THEM THERE IN

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:10.357
THE FIRST PLACE WE'RE BUILDING

01:47:10.423 --> 01:47:13.393
RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAMILIES

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:13.693
KNOWS THAT.

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.294
THOSE THEN.

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:15.729
CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:16.830
PERSON TO HAVE REDUCES THAT

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:18.799
ABYSS IT DID NOT GO BACK INTO

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.400
THE SAME LIFESTYLE THAT THEY

01:47:20.467 --> 01:47:21.735
ONCE WERE IN AND THAT'S WHAT

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:23.136
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO EVEN

01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:23.870
THOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE --

01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:25.806
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE METRIC THAT

01:47:25.872 --> 01:47:27.641
MEET BASICALLY IS WE ARE TO

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:29.109
REHABILITATE.

01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:30.610
IF WE ARE TO ONCE AGAIN GO BACK

01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:32.813
AND TRY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE

01:47:32.879 --> 01:47:34.848
TRAUMA AND TO CREATE PERSONS WHO

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:36.917
ARE HOLD AND PRODUCTIVE AND

01:47:36.983 --> 01:47:38.451
HAPPY AND WITH FAMILY.

01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:39.853
THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY THAT'S

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.488
WHAT REHABILITATION IS ALL ABOUT

01:47:41.555 --> 01:47:42.989
ANDONE OF THE WAYS YOU LOOK AT

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:44.524
IT IS DO THEY WANT TO GO BACK OR

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:45.592
DO THEY GO BACK.

01:47:45.659 --> 01:47:47.427
INTO WHAT THEY'VE DONE BEFORE --

01:47:47.494 --> 01:47:48.895
AND IS THE SCOPE BECAUSE WHAT

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:51.064
WE'VE SEEN IS A CYCLE OF PEOPLE

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:53.266
GOING BACK IN AFTER BEING OUT

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:54.801
AND SO OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE NOT

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:55.969
DONE THE WORK.

01:47:56.036 --> 01:47:56.870
THAT THAT --

01:47:56.937 --> 01:48:00.874
THAT WE NEED TO DO IT WILL FIND.

01:48:00.941 --> 01:48:02.642
AS WE CHANGE NOT JUST THE

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:04.678
PUNISHMENT BUT TRULY FOR PUBLIC

01:48:04.744 --> 01:48:05.879
SAFETY ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:07.280
PUBLIC BUT ALSO TO HELP TO

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:08.849
REBUILD LIVES.

01:48:08.915 --> 01:48:09.816
AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK

01:48:09.883 --> 01:48:11.318
RECIDIVISM IS SO IMPORTANT

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:13.420
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T DEMONSTRATES

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:15.355
TO US IN SOME WAY THAT SOMETHING

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.190
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING

01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:18.625
PEOPLE STAY AWAY FROM THAT

01:48:18.692 --> 01:48:20.861
LIFESTYLE AND TO MOVE ON TO A

01:48:20.927 --> 01:48:21.328
NOTHER.

01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:23.129
LEVEL WHICH IS A DEALING WITH

01:48:23.196 --> 01:48:24.931
FAMILY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND

01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:26.466
THEMSELVES AND SO FORTH AND SO

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:28.602
ON SO THAT'S WHY RECIDIVISM TO

01:48:28.668 --> 01:48:30.470
US IS IMPORTANT.

01:48:30.537 --> 01:48:32.706
AW AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OF

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:34.608
MONEY ALWAYS BUT REALLY ABOUT

01:48:34.674 --> 01:48:36.343
REBUILDING LIVES AND THAT'S WHAT

01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:37.377
WE HOPE TO DO THAT THEN WE A

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:38.979
BILL TATIAN. ONE OF THE WAYS WE

01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:39.679
MEASURE.

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:41.381
OKAY AND ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:44.951

THIS IS NOT JUST GOING TO A

01:48:46.052 --> 01:48:47.153
PROGRAM AND COMING OUT AND NOT

INADEQUATE AND THE RESULTS

01:58:04.243 --> 01:58:05.545
UNRELIABLE FOR DECISION MAKING

INCREASE AND FOUND THAT NOT ONE

HAD MEANINGFUL TRAINING FROM THE

01:58:25.832 --> 01:58:27.867

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:31.504
MOREOVER WE FOUND THOSE WHO

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:32.839

WE ALSO DIRECTLY OBSERVED ABUSES

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.552
IN THE INQUIRY PROCESS WHERE THE

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:48.488

01:58:48.554 --> 01:58:49.589

DISCOURAGED INMATES FROM GOING

01:58:54.827 --> 01:58:57.396
FORWARD WITH THE COMPLAINTS.

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:58.264
NONE OF THE INTERVIEWS WERE

01:58:58.331 --> 01:59:00.199
RECORDED SO THERE WAS NO WAY TO

01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:01.000
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

01:59:01.067 --> 01:59:01.767

G. WAS NOT PRESENT TO OBSERVE.

01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:07.173

01:59:08.474 --> 01:59:10.109
INDEPENDENT.

01:59:24.824 --> 01:59:26.926
OF THE SUBJECTS.

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.060
WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE ENCOURAGE

01:59:28.127 --> 01:59:29.362
WERE NOT KEPT CONFIDENTIAL

01:59:29.428 --> 01:59:30.897
GIVING RISE TO CONCERNS ABOUT

01:59:30.963 --> 01:59:32.265
RETALIATION AGAINST THOSE WHO

01:59:32.331 --> 01:59:33.833
COMPLAINED BY THE SUBJECTS OF

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:36.636
THE COMPLAINTS.

01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:38.004
WE FOUND NO TRUE CRITICAL

RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING DECISIONS.

SIMPLY RUBBER STAMPED THE

01:59:46.212 --> 01:59:47.680
CONCLUSION OF THE OFFICER

01:59:47.747 --> 01:59:48.981
CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY.

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:50.082
INSTEAD OF MAKING A THOUGHTFUL

01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:51.250
DECISION BASED ON THE FACTS

01:59:57.023 --> 01:59:58.691
INFORMATION THEY WERE GIVEN.

01:59:58.758 --> 01:59:59.625
THEY WOULD HAVE REACHED THE SAME

01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:01.928
CONCLUSION WE REACHED NAMELY

02:00:01.994 --> 02:00:03.529
THAT THE INCREASE FOR SO FLAWED.

02:00:03.596 --> 02:00:04.897
THAT NO CONCLUSION COULD BE

02:00:04.964 --> 02:00:07.700
JUSTIFIED.

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:08.701
BASED ON THE SEVERE AND

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:10.403
PERVASIVE ISSUES WE FOUND WE

THE FINDING OF THE REVIEWER.

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:35.788
WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS

02:01:35.855 --> 02:01:37.490
APPROACH DOES NOT REMEDY THE

EVERYTHING FROM EXCESSIVE USE OF

IMPROVEMENTS IN RESPONSE TO

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:34.940
REPORTS OF WIDESPREAD MISCONDUCT.

02:03:35.007 --> 02:03:36.776
ALL TOO OFTEN THE DEPARTMENT

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:38.210
MINIMIZED OR DISMISSED THE

02:03:38.277 --> 02:03:40.312

02:03:40.379 --> 02:03:41.747

02:03:41.814 --> 02:03:43.382
THE SYSTEM APPEAR DESIGNED TO

02:03:43.449 --> 02:03:45.785
DISCREDIT THE VICTIMS OF ABUSE

02:03:45.851 --> 02:03:47.052
BEHIND BARS.

02:03:47.119 --> 02:03:48.754
IT BECAME INCREASINGLY APPARENT

02:03:48.821 --> 02:03:50.089
TO US THAT THE STOCK COMPLAINT

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:52.792
PROCESS WAS FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN.

02:03:52.858 --> 02:03:54.727
WE AND OUR CLIENTS STARTED TO

02:03:54.794 --> 02:03:56.195
WITHHOLD ALLEGATIONS.

02:03:56.262 --> 02:03:57.363
BECAUSE WE WERE NOT CONFIDENT

02:03:57.429 --> 02:03:58.798
THAT THEY WOULD BE MEANINGFUL

02:03:58.864 --> 02:04:00.232
INVESTIGATED.

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:01.400
WE ALSO THOUGHT THERE WAS A REAL

02:04:01.467 --> 02:04:03.369
POSSIBILITY THAT OUR CLIENTS

02:04:03.435 --> 02:04:04.670
WOULD BE RETALIATED AGAINST.

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:07.807
INCLUDING THROUGH PHYSICAL ABUSE.

02:04:07.873 --> 02:04:09.341
I WANT TO GIVE JUST ONE EXAMPLE

02:04:09.408 --> 02:04:11.377
THAT I THINK SORT OF PORTRAYS

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:14.980
THE SITUATION WE WERE ON IN.

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:15.581

FOUND DEAD.

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:21.153
IN HER CELL.

OUTLET AND THE PENCIL WAS

02:04:33.732 --> 02:04:34.800
FASHIONED.

02:04:34.867 --> 02:04:36.335
INTO ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE

02:04:36.402 --> 02:04:38.170

LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS

02:04:47.513 --> 02:04:49.081
RAISE THE POSSIBILITY THAT

02:04:49.148 --> 02:04:50.916
ELECTROCUTION COULD BE THE CAUSE

02:04:50.983 --> 02:04:53.319
OF DEATH IF THE PENCIL HAVE BEEN

02:04:53.385 --> 02:04:54.920
PLACED IN THE ELECTRICAL OUTLET.

02:04:54.987 --> 02:04:56.722
THE CORONER COULD NOT DETERMINE

02:04:56.789 --> 02:04:58.624
A CAUSE OF DEATH.

02:04:58.691 --> 02:05:00.259
WE AT THE PRISM OFFICE STARTED

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:01.560
TO HEAR FOR OUR CLIENTS ALMOST

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:03.295
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS TOOK

02:05:03.362 --> 02:05:05.130
PLACE MANY HAD SEEN WHAT HAD

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:06.398
HAPPENED.

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:08.033
HAD HEARD WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.602
AND SAID THAT STOCKTON THE UNIT

02:05:09.668 --> 02:05:11.370
HAD PURPOSELY LEFT KNOWING THAT

02:05:11.437 --> 02:05:13.239
SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO

02:05:13.305 --> 02:05:14.206
THIS WOMAN.

02:05:14.273 --> 02:05:15.474
OUR CLIENTS HOWEVER WOULD NOT

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:17.109
LET US REPORT IT BECAUSE THEY

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:18.878
SAID THE STAFF MISCONDUCT

02:05:18.944 --> 02:05:20.379
PROCESS WAS SO BROKEN.

02:05:20.446 --> 02:05:22.248
THAT THEY COULD NOT TELL WHETHER

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:24.016
WOULD BE MEANINGFUL INVESTIGATED

02:05:24.083 --> 02:05:25.284
OR WHETHER THEY WOULD FACE

02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:28.120
RETALIATION.

02:05:28.187 --> 02:05:29.154
WE IN CITIES THEIR LEADERSHIP

02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:30.656
KNEW THAT UNLESS SERIOUS ACTION

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:31.590
WAS TAKEN.

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:34.126
IN RESPONSE TO OUR CONCERNS WE

02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:35.828
WOULD END UP IN COURT.

02:05:35.895 --> 02:05:36.896
THEN SECRETARY KERN AND WE

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:38.063
AGREED TO HAVE THE EIICHI

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:40.299
CONDUCTOR OF YOU TO AVOID THAT

02:05:40.366 --> 02:05:42.368
TIME.

02:05:42.434 --> 02:05:43.469
THE O. I. G.'S REVIEW WAS

02:05:43.535 --> 02:05:46.138
THOROUGH OBJECTIVE ACCURATE.

02:05:46.205 --> 02:05:48.507
NEITHER WE NOR THE DEPARTMENT

02:05:48.574 --> 02:05:50.075
DISPUTE THE O. I. G.'S FINDINGS.

02:05:50.142 --> 02:05:51.610
THOUGH I JEEZ REVIEW CONFIRMS

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:53.012
WHAT WE HAVE REPORTED OVER A

02:05:53.078 --> 02:05:54.280
YEAR AGO.

02:05:54.346 --> 02:05:55.147
AND IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL

02:05:55.214 --> 02:05:57.116
SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES BUT WE DID

02:05:57.182 --> 02:05:59.351
NOT KNOW ABOUT OR THAT WE HAD

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:00.719
MERELY SUSPECTED.

02:06:00.786 --> 02:06:02.254
IT IS CLEAR AN UNDISPUTED NOW

02:06:02.321 --> 02:06:03.856
THAT SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF

02:06:03.923 --> 02:06:06.025
ABUSE ARE NOT BEING MEANINGFULLY

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:08.460
ADDRESSED BY THE DEPARTMENT.

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:10.329
AGAIN THAT THE AG REVIEW WAS

02:06:10.396 --> 02:06:10.863
GREAT IT GIVES A LOT OF

02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:12.898
STATISTICS AND DATA BUT I JUST

02:06:12.965 --> 02:06:14.667
WANT TO GIVE ONE EXAMPLE.

02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:16.201
AND IT'S WE HAD REPORTED MY

02:06:16.268 --> 02:06:18.103
OFFICE HAD REPORTED THAT STAFF

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:18.904
TRIED TO FORCE ONE OF OUR

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:21.473
CLIENTS AN ELDERLY BLACK MAN WHO

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:22.875
IS A FULL TIME WHEELCHAIR USER.

OUT OF HIS WHEELCHAIR INTO A

02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:27.146
STANDING HOLDING CAGE IN A

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:28.247
SECLUDED LOCATION.

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:29.114
THEY REPORTEDLY PULLED HIM FROM

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:31.183
HIS WHEEL CHAIR AND SLAMMED HIM

02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:32.384
ONTO THE GROUND.

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:33.919
OUR CLIENT REPORTED THAT THE

PUMMELED ME.

02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:40.192
THEY BEGAN KICKING AND PUNCHING

02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:42.628
WHILE I WAS BASED ON THE GROUND

02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:44.630
WITH HANDCUFFS ON ONE OFFICER

02:06:44.697 --> 02:06:45.998
SAT ON MY FEET AND LEGS.

02:06:46.065 --> 02:06:46.832
AND ANOTHER HAD HIS KNEE ON MY

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:51.270
WEIGHT WHILE THE OTHERS KEPT.

02:06:51.337 --> 02:06:51.937
THOUGH I G. FOUND THE

02:06:52.004 --> 02:06:52.805
DEPARTMENT'S REVIEW OF OUR

02:06:52.871 --> 02:06:54.440
CLIENT'S ALLEGATIONS TO BE

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:55.808
INADEQUATE.

02:06:55.874 --> 02:06:56.709
AMONG OTHER THINGS THE REVIEWER

02:06:56.775 --> 02:06:58.344
FAILED TO INTERVIEW TWO OF THE

02:06:58.410 --> 02:06:59.945
OFFICERS ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN

02:07:00.012 --> 02:07:01.180
THE ALTERCATION.

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:02.648
AND DID NOT ADEQUATELY SUMMARIZE

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:04.049
OUR CLIENTS STATEMENTS IN THE

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:05.517
WRITTEN REPORT.

02:07:05.584 --> 02:07:06.819
FURTHERMORE ALTHOUGH THE

02:07:06.885 --> 02:07:08.620
REVIEWER IDENTIFIED A VIOLATION

02:07:08.687 --> 02:07:10.222
POLICY THE REVIEWER FAILED TO

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:12.024
TAKE ADEQUATE STEPS TO DETERMINE

02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:14.393
WHICH STAFF MEMBER HAD VIOLATED

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:15.894
THAT POLICY.

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:17.563
IN ORDER TO AVOID FURTHER

02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:18.731
LITIGATION THE ID'S

RECOMMENDATIONS NEED TO BE

02:07:20.332 --> 02:07:21.333
ADOPTED.

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:22.001
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT IT WILL

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:24.903
COST MONEY BUT IT IS CRITICAL

02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:26.739
FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND CERTAINLY

02:07:26.805 --> 02:07:29.375
LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A LAWSUIT.

02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:30.709
THE FEDERAL COURT IN ARMSTRONG

02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:32.911

OUR CLIENTS.

02:07:56.735 --> 02:07:58.237
SOME RESPECT IT'S LIKE THE FOX

02:07:58.303 --> 02:07:59.671
GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE THE

THEIR COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS HE

NEUTRAL.

02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:06.011
THOUGH I DO YOU FOUND THE QUOTE

02:08:06.078 --> 02:08:07.179
REVIEWERS DEMONSTRATED THEIR

APPEARS TO WORK REASONABLY WELL

02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:26.265
BUT SO FEW ALLEGATIONS MADE IT

02:08:26.331 --> 02:08:27.466
THAT FAR.

02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:28.667
THE STATE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE

02:08:28.734 --> 02:08:29.868
THAT MOST THE MOST IMPORTANT

ALLEGATIONS CAME BACK SHE HATED.

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:02.568
THAT MEANS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:04.236
COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THAT

02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:05.671

02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:08.507
THAT SHOULD WERE YOU.

02:09:08.574 --> 02:09:09.675
IT MEANS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

IMPROVING INVESTIGATIONS THIS IS

02:09:16.982 --> 02:09:18.917
AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP BUT IT

02:09:18.984 --> 02:09:20.486
IS JUST THAT A FIRST STEP.

02:09:20.552 --> 02:09:22.554
EVEN THEN MANY ALLEGATIONS WILL

BE HE SAID HE SAID SITUATIONS

02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:26.191
THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT

02:09:26.258 --> 02:09:27.826
THERE'S OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE TOLD

02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:29.661
GUILTY PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND TO

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:31.063
EXONERATE OFFICERS.

02:09:31.130 --> 02:09:33.132
IS TO HAVE CAMERAS IN THE

02:09:33.198 --> 02:09:36.869
INSTITUTION.

02:09:36.935 --> 02:09:37.970
AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD

02:09:38.036 --> 02:09:39.605
THAT -- THE

02:09:39.671 --> 02:09:41.740
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS

02:09:41.807 --> 02:09:44.276
DONE TO REVIEWS AT THAT WE'VE

02:09:44.343 --> 02:09:47.279
FINISHED TO HELP TO INITIATE.

02:09:47.346 --> 02:09:49.114
ONE WAS THROUGH --

02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:50.716
THE REQUEST THAT WE PUT WHETHER

STATE PRISON THAT WHERE THERE

02:09:55.621 --> 02:09:57.322
WAS AN INCREDIBLY HIGH LEVEL OF

02:09:57.389 --> 02:09:59.124
ABUSE -- AND

02:09:59.191 --> 02:10:03.295
THE OTHER ONE WAS OF JUST HEARD --

02:10:03.362 --> 02:10:05.197
IN BOTH CASES.

02:10:05.264 --> 02:10:06.698
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S

02:10:06.765 --> 02:10:08.834
OBJECTIVE REVIEW --

02:10:08.901 --> 02:10:10.602
ALLOWED US TO HAVE US SET OF

02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:12.104
FACTS WHICH BOTH PARTIES THE

02:10:12.171 --> 02:10:13.272
DEPARTMENT AND US.

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:15.807
COULD RELY ON AND IN BOTH CASES

02:10:15.874 --> 02:10:17.442
WELL IN THE HIGH DESERT CASE.

02:10:17.509 --> 02:10:18.844
THEY TOOK.

02:10:18.911 --> 02:10:20.646
A LOT OF REMEDIAL MEASURES THAT

02:10:20.712 --> 02:10:22.314
WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:25.050
CONTROL OF THE ABUSE THAT WAS

02:10:25.117 --> 02:10:26.919
OCCURRING AT THAT PRISON --

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:29.421
AS INSPECTOR GENERAL WESLEY JUST

02:10:29.488 --> 02:10:31.423
SAID HE CANNOT DO THOSE REVIEWS

02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:33.358
ON HIS OWN HE HAS TO AT THE

02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:34.693

SENATE IN ORDER TO DO THAT.

02:10:39.364 --> 02:10:41.033
THOSE REVIEWS AND WE BELIEVE

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:42.601
THAT AS A WELL WE KNOW THAT WAS

02:10:42.668 --> 02:10:45.437
A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT IN TWO

02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:46.038
THOUSAND ELEVEN WE THINK THAT

02:10:46.104 --> 02:10:47.839
AMENDMENT SHOULD BE REPEALED SO

02:10:47.906 --> 02:10:50.142
THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AT

02:10:50.209 --> 02:10:51.476
HIS DISCRETION.

02:10:51.543 --> 02:10:53.178
OR HER DISCRETION CAN --

02:10:53.245 --> 02:10:55.447
INITIATE A REVIEW AND SAVE THE

02:10:55.514 --> 02:10:57.516
STATE FROM SIMILAR LAWSUITS IN

02:10:57.583 --> 02:10:59.618
THE FUTURE BECAUSE THERE'S NO

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:03.222

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:23.915
THERE ARE A FEW THAT WE DO THAT

02:15:23.982 --> 02:15:25.317
STILL NEED TO HAVE FOR THE

02:15:25.383 --> 02:15:27.853
CONVERSATIONS ON NOW THERE ARE --

02:15:27.919 --> 02:15:29.621
LABOR IMPLICATIONS WITH THE

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:32.224
UNIONS WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING

02:15:32.290 --> 02:15:33.725
STAFF UNDER TAPE RECORDER.

02:15:33.792 --> 02:15:35.494
THAT FALLS MORE INTO THE FULL --

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.863
INTERNAL AFFAIRS PIECE THERE ARE

02:15:37.929 --> 02:15:40.165
POBRE CONCERNS WITH THAT --

02:15:40.232 --> 02:15:43.401
BUT WITH I THINK IT'S A WHOLE.

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:45.303
WE FUNDAMENTALLY AGREE AND I

02:15:45.370 --> 02:15:46.771
WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ROLE AND

02:15:46.838 --> 02:15:49.474
I ABOUT THIS BUT IT DOES COME

02:15:49.541 --> 02:15:51.142
WITH A RESOURCE ISSUE.

02:15:51.209 --> 02:15:52.677
AND SO IN TOTAL WE ARE LOOKING

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:54.613
SO AND IN INTERNALLY WE HAVE TO

02:15:54.679 --> 02:15:55.714
LOOK INTERNALLY HOW WE CAN

02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:56.815
STRUCTURE THIS WE CAN

02:15:56.882 --> 02:15:58.116
AFFECTIVELY.

02:15:58.183 --> 02:16:00.085
ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND IF

02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:02.320
THERE IS A RESOURCE ASK AT WE

02:16:02.387 --> 02:16:03.355
WOULD HAVE TO BRIDGE SENSE

02:16:03.421 --> 02:16:03.822
SOMETHING MORE TO THE

02:16:03.889 --> 02:16:06.024
ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE WE

MAKE SURE WE ARE ASKING FOR THE

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:12.831
CORRECT THING BUT AT THIS POINT.

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:13.999
TO COME AND ASK FOR ANY

02:16:14.065 --> 02:16:15.200
RESOURCES WITHOUT GETTING IN

02:16:15.267 --> 02:16:16.468
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION BE

02:16:16.535 --> 02:16:17.502
PREMATURE.

02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:18.470
BUT I KNOW THAT --

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:22.274
THE FIFTEEN STAFF THAT ARE OUT

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:24.209

02:16:31.716 --> 02:16:32.884
THAT IS OUR TO BECOMING BURDEN

02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:34.286

EVEN WORKING WITH THE AND YOU

02:16:49.334 --> 02:16:50.569

02:16:52.203 --> 02:16:53.838
THAT I DESERT FIRST OF ALL BY

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:55.574

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:02.280
WE HAD STAFF GOING INTO FOCUS

02:17:02.347 --> 02:17:03.648
TRAINING WITH HEADQUARTERS STAFF

ARE NOT BEING SWEPT IN THE RUNS

02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:09.955
THAT WE ARE DRESSED

02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:10.755
INAPPROPRIATELY.

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:13.091
I THINK HOLISTICALLY TO HAVE THE

02:17:13.158 --> 02:17:16.394
TROOPS HELLO IS LOOKING FOR IT

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:17.629

NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT THE TRUE

02:17:19.297 --> 02:17:20.665
CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE STAFFING

02:17:20.732 --> 02:17:22.601
AND TRAINING --

02:17:22.667 --> 02:17:23.602
WE NEED TO GET SOMETHING FROM

02:17:23.668 --> 02:17:24.536
THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE

02:17:24.603 --> 02:17:26.371
SURE WORK OR MAKING THE RIGHT

02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:30.008
REQUESTS.

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:31.343
YOU KNOW WHEN I READ THIS IS

02:17:31.409 --> 02:17:33.812
SOUND LIKE A NIGHTMARE --

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:35.981
SOUND LIKE EVERY.

02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:37.382
PRISON MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN.

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:39.284
WHAT WITH PEOPLE WITH REAL

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:40.919
ISSUES REAL COMPLAINTS AND A

02:17:40.986 --> 02:17:42.554
HIGH LEVEL INTIMIDATION

02:17:42.621 --> 02:17:44.689
EVERYBODY'S KIND OF FEEDING INTO

02:17:44.756 --> 02:17:45.557
THE SAME?

02:17:45.624 --> 02:17:47.425
STORY AND NOBODY'S BEING HELD

02:17:47.492 --> 02:17:49.694
ACCOUNTABLE AND SO RELEASED IT

02:17:49.761 --> 02:17:52.163
SOUNDS VERY --

02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:53.565
READ THIS FIRST OF ALL I MEAN

02:17:53.632 --> 02:17:54.566
JUST IN.

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:56.635
TERMS OF BASIC THINGS THAT OUGHT

02:17:56.701 --> 02:17:58.036
TO HAPPEN IN AN ASSESSMENT AND

02:17:58.103 --> 02:17:59.704
EVALUATION YOU KNOW YOU NORMALLY

02:17:59.771 --> 02:18:00.772
EVEN.

02:18:00.839 --> 02:18:02.374
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HAVE PIERCED

02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:04.476
EVALUATE EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF

02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:05.944
THE YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP

02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:07.278
THAT THEY HAVE AND AND SO

02:18:07.345 --> 02:18:08.847
THEREFORE YOU BUILD A SYSTEM

02:18:08.913 --> 02:18:10.682
THAT KIND OF FEEDS ON ITSELF IN

02:18:10.749 --> 02:18:12.317
IN SOME WAY AND AS A RESULT.

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:13.585
THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND THEY

02:18:13.652 --> 02:18:14.753
BECOME EVEN WORSE BECAUSE THEY

02:18:14.819 --> 02:18:16.521
BECOME MORE PROTECTED SO AS I

02:18:16.588 --> 02:18:18.323
WAS READING THIS AND AS I HAD

02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:20.291
HAVE TO MOTHER MEETINGS WITH

02:18:20.358 --> 02:18:21.760
INDIVIDUALS IT BECAME.

02:18:21.826 --> 02:18:23.261
I REALLY WAS I MEAN IT WAS LIKE

02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:25.130
A NIGHTMARE MOVIE OF OF OF THE

02:18:25.196 --> 02:18:27.399
GREATEST VIEW YOU HAVE ALWAYS IN

02:18:27.465 --> 02:18:28.833
LIFE IS ONE IS GOING TO PRISON.

02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:30.435
AND THEN BEING CAPTIVE THERE

02:18:30.502 --> 02:18:32.137
WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEEM TO

02:18:32.203 --> 02:18:33.872
TREAT YOU FAIRLY AND THEN YOU

02:18:33.938 --> 02:18:35.507
HAVE VERY LITTLE WAYS IN WHICH

02:18:35.573 --> 02:18:36.441
YOU CAN.

02:18:36.508 --> 02:18:39.444
EXPRESS YOURSELF BECAUSE THIS

02:18:39.511 --> 02:18:42.414
HIGH LEVEL AND THOSE KINDS OF

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:43.448
THINGS SO WHEN I READ THIS IS

02:18:43.515 --> 02:18:45.750
JUST LIKE WHOA AND THEN I ASKED

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:47.919
DO WE HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS

02:18:47.986 --> 02:18:50.555

BE MOVES AWAY I DON'T SEE A

02:18:56.261 --> 02:18:57.529
PROPOSAL NECESSARY TO FUND THIS

02:18:57.595 --> 02:19:00.398
BUT TO ME THIS IS CRISIS AYE AYE

02:19:00.465 --> 02:19:03.668
MAYBE IT'S NOT IN IN.

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:05.303
MAY BECAUSE I I YOU KNOW AND I

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:06.438
I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF PRISONS

02:19:06.504 --> 02:19:07.739
WOULDN'T MAYBE IT'S THAT YOU

02:19:07.806 --> 02:19:08.273
KNOW MAYBE NOT A CRISIS.

02:19:08.339 --> 02:19:09.207
FOUGHT TO THOSE WHO ON THE

02:19:09.274 --> 02:19:11.509
OUTSIDE BUT TO ME TO THINKING

02:19:11.576 --> 02:19:13.044
THAT I WITH OUR WORK IN THE

02:19:13.111 --> 02:19:14.412
INSIDE AND CAPTIVE.

02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:16.681
AND HAVE ALL OF MY RIGHTS KIND

02:19:16.748 --> 02:19:18.616
OF JUST TRAMPLED ON IN A DE

02:19:18.683 --> 02:19:20.985
HUMANIZE IN SOME WAYS AND HAVE

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:21.953
LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS THAT I

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:23.321
CAN'T EXPRESS AND I'VE HEARD

02:19:23.388 --> 02:19:24.489
PEOPLE SAY THAT BECAUSE THEN

02:19:24.556 --> 02:19:26.224
THERE'S RETALIATION AND YOU

02:19:26.291 --> 02:19:26.825
DON'T GET THIS YOU DON'T GET

02:19:26.891 --> 02:19:27.759
THAT IN.

02:19:27.826 --> 02:19:30.095
YOUR FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:19:30.161 --> 02:19:31.730
NIGHT COMING DEAL WITH PEOPLE.

02:19:31.796 --> 02:19:32.363
IS THAT THAT IS FRIGHTENING TO

02:19:32.430 --> 02:19:33.932
THINK THAT THAT THAT THERE IS A

02:19:33.998 --> 02:19:35.900
REPORT THAT WE HAVE THAT ALMOST

02:19:35.967 --> 02:19:37.368
MIRRORS --

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:39.204
SOME OF THESE MOVIES A WE SEE

02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:40.105
THAT I'VE SEEN --

02:19:40.171 --> 02:19:41.773
THAT REALLY TALK ABOUT THE

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:44.542
INTERNAL WORKINGS OF OF OF OF

02:19:44.609 --> 02:19:45.643
INCARCERATED --

02:19:45.710 --> 02:19:46.778
INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF THE

02:19:46.845 --> 02:19:49.814
PRISONS AND AND THE LACK OF

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:52.016
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ONE EXPRESS

02:19:52.083 --> 02:19:53.451
THEMSELVES OR HAVE THEMSELVES

02:19:53.518 --> 02:19:55.820
FAIRLY HEARD OR WHATEVER MAY BE

02:19:55.887 --> 02:19:57.455
SO I'M CONCERNED AT THAT WE

02:19:57.522 --> 02:19:59.090
DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANYTHING THAT

02:19:59.157 --> 02:19:59.958
SAYS THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO

02:20:00.024 --> 02:20:00.692
HAPPEN.

02:20:00.759 --> 02:20:02.427
I'M EQUALLY CONCERNED THAT WE

02:20:02.494 --> 02:20:04.763
DON'T HAVE AN X. WHAT

02:20:04.829 --> 02:20:06.664
INVESTIGATE THESE THINGS I ME

02:20:06.731 --> 02:20:07.999
INSPECTOR GENERAL IS IN THESE

02:20:08.066 --> 02:20:09.134
PRISONS MORE THAN ALL OF US

02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:10.368
THERE IN ALL THE TIME AND THEY

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:11.503
DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNLESS

02:20:11.569 --> 02:20:13.104
SOMEBODY ASKED THEM.

02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:14.572
AND BY THE TIME THEY GET ASKED

02:20:14.639 --> 02:20:16.574
THE PROBLEM IS IS IS HORRIBLE I

02:20:16.641 --> 02:20:18.243
MEAN IT IS ESCALATED TO THE

02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:19.944
POINT THAT THE SPEAKER OR THE

02:20:20.011 --> 02:20:21.446
PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE

02:20:21.513 --> 02:20:22.847
GOVERNOR NOW IS AWARE OF THIS

02:20:22.914 --> 02:20:23.414
PROBLEM.

02:20:23.481 --> 02:20:25.049
WHEN IT GETS TO THAT LEVEL IT

02:20:25.116 --> 02:20:26.751
HAS REALLY GONE BEYOND WHERE IT

02:20:26.818 --> 02:20:28.586
SHOULD BE BECAUSE THESE KINDS OF

02:20:28.653 --> 02:20:30.021
ISSUES SHOULD BE ADDRESSED ON AN

02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:31.656
ONGOING BASIS?

02:20:31.723 --> 02:20:33.258
IN TERMS OF STRUCTURE AND AND

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:34.726
PROGRAMS AND ASSESSMENT AND

02:20:34.793 --> 02:20:36.694
EVALUATION AND ALL THIS KIND OF

02:20:36.761 --> 02:20:37.295
THING SO.

02:20:37.362 --> 02:20:39.297
I READ THIS WITH WITH WITH GREAT

02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:40.832
ALARM I MEAN IT WAS LIKE A

02:20:40.899 --> 02:20:42.734
NIGHTMARE TO READ THIS AND AND

02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:45.837
THEN TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND HAVE

02:20:45.904 --> 02:20:47.105
FOLKS SAY YEAH THAT'S TRUE.

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:48.973
IT OUT OF AND AND IT'S GONNA

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:50.575
TAKE RESOURCES TO CHANGE IT --

02:20:50.642 --> 02:20:52.577
WHICH IS TRUE BUT I DON'T SEE A

02:20:52.644 --> 02:20:54.245
REQUEST FOR THE RESOURCES SO I

02:20:54.312 --> 02:20:56.047
DON'T REALLY SEE THE THE REAL

02:20:56.114 --> 02:20:57.749
SERIOUSNESS ABOUT THE CHANGE

02:20:57.816 --> 02:20:59.384
MAYBE IT IS SAID MAYBE THIS

02:20:59.450 --> 02:21:00.652
SEASON SO COME FROM US.

02:21:00.718 --> 02:21:01.753
IN TERMS OF HOW WE DEAL WITH

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.621
RESOURCES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE

02:21:03.688 --> 02:21:05.156
HOW WE DEAL WITH AN INSPECTOR

02:21:05.223 --> 02:21:06.991
GENERAL WHO HAS IT DOESN'T HAVE

02:21:07.058 --> 02:21:07.992
THE AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT THEY

02:21:08.059 --> 02:21:08.960
NEED TO OUT WAS THAT THE

02:21:09.027 --> 02:21:10.094
INSPECTOR GENERAL.

02:21:10.161 --> 02:21:11.329
WAS DEMAND YOU KNOW THAT IN

02:21:11.396 --> 02:21:12.997
TERMS OF PRISONS THAT THEY WOULD

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:15.033
BE THE PERSON WHO'S IN THERE ALL

02:21:15.099 --> 02:21:15.834
THE TIME AND MAKING

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:17.101
RECOMMENDATIONS AND IF THERE WAS

02:21:17.168 --> 02:21:18.436
CORRUPTION IT WOULD BE BECAUSE

02:21:18.503 --> 02:21:19.504
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS NOT

02:21:19.571 --> 02:21:20.605
DOING HIS JOB.

02:21:20.672 --> 02:21:22.907
BUT NOW THAT I DISCOVERED THAT

02:21:22.974 --> 02:21:24.309
WE HAVE A NEUTER THIS AT TWO

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:26.311

ABLE TO MONITOR THIS SYSTEM THAT

02:21:29.547 --> 02:21:31.049
WE REALLY NEED MONITORING UP.

02:21:31.115 --> 02:21:32.350
IN ORDER TO PREVENT THESE KINDS

02:21:32.417 --> 02:21:35.820
OF NIGHTMARES THAT ISIS CEILING

TV MOVIES WOULD SAYING SAYING

02:21:37.522 --> 02:21:38.656
PRISON OR WHATEVER IT WAS.

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:40.959
IT MAKES ME VERY VERY CONCERNED

02:21:41.025 --> 02:21:42.527

IN REQUEST THAT I SEE IT BUT NOT

02:21:49.834 --> 02:21:51.736

MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY ERIN

ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THERE ARE

02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:12.323
SOME ISSUES.

02:22:12.390 --> 02:22:13.958
THAT --

02:22:14.025 --> 02:22:15.760
URGENTLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED --

02:22:15.827 --> 02:22:17.128
WE THANKED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

02:22:17.195 --> 02:22:18.630
ON THE PLO FOR BRINGING THIS TO

02:22:18.696 --> 02:22:20.465
OUR ATTENTION --

02:22:20.531 --> 02:22:22.734
AS MISTER DE AS INDICATED WE ARE

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:26.304
EVALUATING THE PASSED OPTIONS TO

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:27.572
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

02:22:27.639 --> 02:22:31.809
ARE IT IS LIKELY TO REQUIRE SOME

02:22:31.876 --> 02:22:32.277
RESOURCES [inaudible]

02:22:32.343 --> 02:22:34.746
AND WE ABSOLUTELY THANK THAT IF

02:22:34.812 --> 02:22:36.080
IT DOES REQUIRE RESOURCES WE

02:22:36.147 --> 02:22:37.248
WILL BE PROVIDING THOSE

02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:38.816
RESOURCES THIS IS A VERY

02:22:38.883 --> 02:22:40.885
IMPORTANT ISSUE --

02:22:40.952 --> 02:22:43.588
AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:45.623
THAT THERE ARE REALLY SORT OF

02:22:45.690 --> 02:22:47.091
TWO POINTS IN TIME THAT THE

02:22:47.158 --> 02:22:48.660
ADMINISTRATION COMES FORWARD

02:22:48.726 --> 02:22:51.095
WITH REQUESTS IN THE BUDGET --

02:22:51.162 --> 02:22:52.764
THE FIRST BEING THE JANUARY

02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:55.466
BUDGET ON THE SECOND BEING.

02:22:55.533 --> 02:22:56.668
AT MAY REVISE.

02:22:56.734 --> 02:22:58.803
RIGHT THIS REPORT CAME OUT I

02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:00.505
THINK RIGHT AFTER THE RE RELEASE

02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:01.773
OF THE JANUARY BUDGET AND THAT

02:23:01.839 --> 02:23:03.975
IS WHY THERE WERE NO RESOURCES

02:23:04.042 --> 02:23:06.511
REQUESTED AS PART OF THE BUDGET --

02:23:06.577 --> 02:23:08.346
IN TERMS OF THE TIMING HERE WE

02:23:08.413 --> 02:23:10.148
ARE AS I SAID EVALUATING OPTIONS

02:23:10.214 --> 02:23:12.116
AND WE DO ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE

02:23:12.183 --> 02:23:13.618
TO COME FORWARD WITH SOME TYPE

02:23:13.685 --> 02:23:16.721
OF PROPOSAL. TO ADDRESS THIS

02:23:16.788 --> 02:23:18.523
VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

02:23:18.589 --> 02:23:19.590
AS PART OF THE MARY VISION --

02:23:19.657 --> 02:23:22.627
WITH REALLY.

02:23:22.694 --> 02:23:24.095
IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT

02:23:24.162 --> 02:23:25.897
IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED

02:23:25.964 --> 02:23:27.498
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE LARGER

02:23:27.565 --> 02:23:29.133
STATE BUDGET.

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.135
PICTURE AND I THINK THE

02:23:31.202 --> 02:23:33.137
APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO THAT IS

02:23:33.204 --> 02:23:34.639
WHEN THE GOVERNOR CAN CONSIDER

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:36.841
ALL OF THE VARIOUS STATE BUDGET

02:23:36.908 --> 02:23:38.476
PRIORITIES TOGETHER.

02:23:38.543 --> 02:23:40.378
AS WELL AS THIS ISSUE --

02:23:40.445 --> 02:23:42.080
AND DETERMINE WHAT IS THE BEST

02:23:42.146 --> 02:23:44.882
APPROACH TO MOVE FORWARD WELL.

02:23:44.949 --> 02:23:46.818
I'M SURE YOU RECOGNIZE AS MY

02:23:46.884 --> 02:23:48.720
CHAIR OF A BUDGET ALWAYS SAYS

02:23:48.786 --> 02:23:50.088
THAT THE THE IT IS THE

02:23:50.154 --> 02:23:51.122
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:23:51.189 --> 02:23:52.323
LEGISLATURE. TO CREATE THE

02:23:52.390 --> 02:23:54.058
BUDGET.

02:23:54.125 --> 02:23:55.193
AT THE GOVERNOR ONLY HAS VETO

02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:59.731
POWER -- AND

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:01.366
BUT HE CAN'T AT THINGS IN.

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:02.900
AND SO WILL MAKES A VERY CLEAR

02:24:02.967 --> 02:24:04.135
HE CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:05.436
BUT IS RESPONSIBLE OF THE

02:24:05.503 --> 02:24:07.238
LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE THE

02:24:07.305 --> 02:24:08.973
ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE THERE TO

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:10.341
MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:24:10.408 --> 02:24:12.977
AND AND I REALIZE THAT DEADLINES

02:24:13.044 --> 02:24:15.046
AND DATES HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:16.981
GOVERNOR MAKES A STATEMENT IN

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:18.049
JANUARY BUT WE HAVE A WHOLE LOT

02:24:18.116 --> 02:24:19.884
OF LETTERS THAT COME TO US IN

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:21.185
THE INTRO.

02:24:21.252 --> 02:24:21.652
BEYOND THE GOVERNOR'S

02:24:21.719 --> 02:24:22.920
RECOMMENDATION.

02:24:22.987 --> 02:24:24.255
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS

02:24:24.322 --> 02:24:27.392
WHO'VE MAKING REQUEST STATION.

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:29.293
OF THAT'S THERE AND AND AS I

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:31.162
SAID I YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THIS

02:24:31.229 --> 02:24:31.896
IS IS REALLY

02:24:31.963 --> 02:24:33.664
A A OF ALL THE THINGS WE'VE KIND

02:24:33.731 --> 02:24:34.966
OF HEARD ABOUT PROGRAM TO WORK

02:24:35.033 --> 02:24:36.534
AND DON'T WORK AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:38.236
THIS IS TRULY A VIOLATION I MEAN

02:24:38.302 --> 02:24:39.904
THIS IS REALLY ABUSIVE PEOPLE I

02:24:39.971 --> 02:24:41.873
MEAN TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AND I'M

02:24:41.939 --> 02:24:43.541
NOT AND I'M EVEN CONCERNED THAT

02:24:43.608 --> 02:24:44.375
HAVING.

02:24:44.442 --> 02:24:46.277
A THE RESPONSIBILITY WILL FORTY

02:24:46.344 --> 02:24:47.078
SOME ODD YEARS OF DOING

02:24:47.145 --> 02:24:48.613
ASSESSMENT EVALUATION FACULTY

02:24:48.679 --> 02:24:49.847
AND STUDENT COMPLAINTS AND SO

02:24:49.914 --> 02:24:52.950
FORTH AND SO ON THAT ONE I HAVE --

02:24:53.017 --> 02:24:54.719
KIND OF PEOPLE INVESTIGATING

02:24:54.786 --> 02:24:56.020
EACH OTHER.

02:24:56.087 --> 02:24:57.155
AND THEIR FRIENDS.

02:24:57.221 --> 02:24:58.956
THAT DOESN'T RISE TO A LEVEL OF

02:24:59.023 --> 02:25:00.258
CONCERN FOR ME THAT I WOULD

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:02.060
THINK WITH SOME FROM THE SYSTEM

02:25:02.126 --> 02:25:03.528
EVEN IF IF I ONLY HAVE A FEW

02:25:03.594 --> 02:25:04.695
COMPLAINTS PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE

02:25:04.762 --> 02:25:05.963
EVALUATING.

02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:07.398
THEIR FRIENDS AND ASSESSING

02:25:07.465 --> 02:25:09.767
THEMSELVES AND AND AND HAVE ME

02:25:09.834 --> 02:25:11.302
BELIEVE THAT IS WITH ANY LEVEL

02:25:11.369 --> 02:25:13.771
OF OF FIDELITY THAT THAT THIS IS

02:25:13.838 --> 02:25:15.306
A GOOD PROCESS THAT THAT SHOULD

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:16.140
BE THERE THAT.

02:25:16.207 --> 02:25:17.442
SOMEHOW TO AND AND I KNOW THAT

02:25:17.508 --> 02:25:19.077
SOMETIMES IN THE PROCESS OF

02:25:19.143 --> 02:25:20.711
DEALING WITH --

02:25:20.778 --> 02:25:22.046
YOU KNOW WITH WITH FOLKS WHO ARE

02:25:22.113 --> 02:25:23.514
INCARCERATED IN OTHERS WE HAVE A

02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:25.283
TENDENCY SOMETIMES EIGHT

02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:27.118
INSTITUTIONS KIND OF DISMISSED

02:25:27.185 --> 02:25:28.820
THEIR COMPLAINTS OF TO DISMISS

02:25:28.886 --> 02:25:30.321
THEM BUT NOT TO GIVE IN SAME

02:25:30.388 --> 02:25:31.722
LEVEL RIGHTS AS YOU POINTED OUT

02:25:31.789 --> 02:25:31.923
THAT.

02:25:31.989 --> 02:25:35.526
THAT THEY'D STILL DESERVE IT

02:25:35.593 --> 02:25:38.763
THEY HAVE NOT LOST PLAINTIFFS IN

02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:39.530
THIS REPORT OF THAT HAVE COME

02:25:39.597 --> 02:25:40.832
FORWARD.

02:25:40.898 --> 02:25:42.800
SO I I'M JUST SAYING.

02:25:42.867 --> 02:25:45.236
I AS IT TO ME ABOUT IT IT IT'S

02:25:45.303 --> 02:25:46.971
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A RED FLAG

02:25:47.038 --> 02:25:48.806
AS A LOT OF ALARM TO GO OFF WHEN

02:25:48.873 --> 02:25:50.341
I READ SOMETHING LIKE THIS --

02:25:50.408 --> 02:25:51.676
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE LEVEL

02:25:51.742 --> 02:25:53.077
OF SENSITIVITY IN THE

02:25:53.144 --> 02:25:54.745
INSTITUTION WOULD BE LIKE WISE

02:25:54.812 --> 02:25:55.980
AND WHILE WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE

02:25:56.047 --> 02:25:58.015
IT THE GOVERNOR MAY GET AROUND

02:25:58.082 --> 02:25:59.117
TO DEALING WITH THIS.

02:25:59.183 --> 02:26:01.319
THE REALITY IS THAT THIS

02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:03.988
COMMITTEE IS HEARING IT NOW.

02:26:04.055 --> 02:26:05.423
AND HAS TO RESPOND TO IT.

02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:06.791
MANAGER IF I IF I MAY I I DON'T

02:26:06.858 --> 02:26:08.860
WANT TO LEAVE THIS TABLE.

02:26:08.926 --> 02:26:10.528
WHAT WITH THE THOUGHT THAT --

02:26:10.595 --> 02:26:12.663
SINCE THE REPORTED IN PRE REPORT

02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:14.031
ON POST REPORT THAT.

02:26:14.098 --> 02:26:15.066
THE DEPARTMENT HAS AN ADDRESS

02:26:15.133 --> 02:26:16.601
THE CONCERNS.

02:26:16.667 --> 02:26:18.302
OF BECAUSE WE HAVE AND JUST THE

02:26:18.369 --> 02:26:19.570
THOUGHT THAT --

02:26:19.637 --> 02:26:20.438
THE INITIAL THOUGHT THAT

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:22.507
INTERNAL STAFF DOING ENQUIRIES

02:26:22.573 --> 02:26:23.774
ON THEIR OWN STAFF IS CONCERNING

02:26:23.841 --> 02:26:25.209
UHHUH.

02:26:25.276 --> 02:26:26.878
SO THAT HAS SINCE CHANGED.

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:28.246
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED STAFF THAT

02:26:28.312 --> 02:26:29.947
ARE DOING THOSE ENQUIRIES

02:26:30.014 --> 02:26:31.649
OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION AND

02:26:31.716 --> 02:26:32.984
THEY ARE UNDER THE DIVISION OF

02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:35.086
OVERSIGHT THAT IS OUTSIDE OF THE

02:26:35.153 --> 02:26:36.787
PRISON PROPER --

02:26:36.854 --> 02:26:38.022
THAT IN ITSELF IS IS A

02:26:38.089 --> 02:26:41.025
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE --

02:26:41.092 --> 02:26:41.592
THERE'S A TRAINING COMPONENT

02:26:41.659 --> 02:26:44.996
THAT ALSO THE STAFF MEMBERS. TO

02:26:45.062 --> 02:26:46.998
ASK THE PROPER QUESTIONS TO TO

02:26:47.064 --> 02:26:49.500
HAVE REPORT WRITING SO WHEN THE

02:26:49.567 --> 02:26:51.102
HIRING AUTHORITY OR THE DECISION

02:26:51.169 --> 02:26:52.303
MAKER READ THAT THEY KNOW THE

02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:53.938
READING A REPORT THIS BEEN.

02:26:54.005 --> 02:26:55.006
THOROUGHLY WENT THROUGH THAT'S

02:26:55.072 --> 02:26:57.441
BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED --

02:26:57.508 --> 02:26:59.076
WERE ALREADY SEEN INDICATIONS

02:26:59.143 --> 02:27:00.044
THAT --

02:27:00.111 --> 02:27:02.180
THAT'S IN A THAT THAT'S THAT'S

02:27:02.246 --> 02:27:02.914
BECAUSE IT'S A MEANT BACK

02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:04.415
BECAUSE WE TRADITIONALLY WERE

02:27:04.482 --> 02:27:05.816
ABLE TO MEET TIME FRAME FOR

02:27:05.883 --> 02:27:06.717
THESE COMPLAINTS.

02:27:06.784 --> 02:27:07.852
WERE ALREADY MISSING THOSE TIME

02:27:07.919 --> 02:27:09.921
FRAMES I DON'T LIKE MISS TIME

02:27:09.987 --> 02:27:10.922
FRAME TO WHAT IT'S TELLING ME

02:27:10.988 --> 02:27:13.191
NOW IS A DOING A MORE THOROUGH

02:27:13.257 --> 02:27:15.293
REVIEW ON THESE CASES --

02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:16.627
BUT I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE

02:27:16.694 --> 02:27:17.662
THIS TABLE WITH THE IMPRESSION

02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:18.796
THAT WE READ THIS AND HAVEN'T

02:27:18.863 --> 02:27:20.498
DONE ANYTHING SINCE NOW I ASSUME

02:27:20.565 --> 02:27:21.899
YOU WANT TO READ THIS.

02:27:21.966 --> 02:27:23.334
AND THAT AND AS I READ SOME OF

02:27:23.401 --> 02:27:24.101
THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'RE

02:27:24.168 --> 02:27:25.469
BEGINNING TO LOOK AT MY CONCERN

02:27:25.536 --> 02:27:27.205
WAS THAT IT THAT IT WAS IN PLACE

02:27:27.271 --> 02:27:28.506
IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT.

02:27:28.573 --> 02:27:30.208
THAT THE INTERNAL THE

02:27:30.274 --> 02:27:31.876
INVESTIGATIONS WERE IN PLACE

02:27:31.943 --> 02:27:32.710
WHERE PEOPLE INVESTIGATING THE

02:27:32.777 --> 02:27:34.145
FRIENDS AND AND IT WAS KIND OF

02:27:34.212 --> 02:27:35.346
AN INTERNAL THING THAT WAS

02:27:35.413 --> 02:27:37.415
CONCERNED FOR ME CLEARLY ONCE

02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:38.449
THE REPORT IS WRITTEN I KNOW

02:27:38.516 --> 02:27:39.016
THAT --

02:27:39.083 --> 02:27:40.484
BASED ON THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN

02:27:40.551 --> 02:27:41.085
MADE AND WHAT HAVE YOU THAT

02:27:41.152 --> 02:27:43.054
THING'S GOING TO A THAT YOU WANT

02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:44.388
TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES NOW.

02:27:44.455 --> 02:27:45.923
I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED AS TO HOW

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:47.391
THEY HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE

02:27:47.458 --> 02:27:48.292
YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET TO A

02:27:48.359 --> 02:27:50.494
SYSTEM THAT STARTS DOING THIS

02:27:50.561 --> 02:27:51.929
KIND OF THING THAT'S THERE AND

02:27:51.996 --> 02:27:55.032
AND AND THAT WITH IT SHOULD

02:27:55.099 --> 02:27:56.934
NEVER GOT [inaudible]

02:27:57.001 --> 02:28:00.271
MADAM CHAIRMAN CONCERN AS AS

02:28:00.338 --> 02:28:02.707
RITA POINTED OUT WE FOR A HAD

02:28:02.773 --> 02:28:05.076
LETTER AFTER LETTER FOR THE LAST

02:28:05.142 --> 02:28:07.878
I DON'T KNOW. TEN YEARS --

02:28:07.945 --> 02:28:09.480
POINTING OUT THESE ISSUES --

02:28:09.547 --> 02:28:12.884
AND IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO US

02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:14.552
THAT THEY GOT IT GETS TO THIS

02:28:14.619 --> 02:28:16.120
LEVEL AS WELL BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:28:16.187 --> 02:28:17.288
UNKNOWN --

02:28:17.355 --> 02:28:18.956
PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED WHO

02:28:19.023 --> 02:28:22.293
SUFFERED BECAUSE OF IT AND SO --

02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:24.428
WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

02:28:24.495 --> 02:28:25.896
DEPARTMENT --

02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:29.367
ABOUT THIS AND IF BY CHANCE THE

02:28:29.433 --> 02:28:31.435
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T COME FOR

02:28:31.502 --> 02:28:33.671
WITH THE APPROPRIATE PACKAGE AND

02:28:33.738 --> 02:28:35.573
WE YOU WANT TO DETERMINE.

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:37.375
WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ALLOCATION

02:28:37.441 --> 02:28:39.076
SHOULD BE WE CAN CERTAINLY

02:28:39.143 --> 02:28:41.045
PROVIDE OUR INPUT INTO WHAT WE

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:42.980
THINK IS NECESSARY TO RESOLVE

02:28:43.047 --> 02:28:44.548
THESE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE WELL

02:28:44.615 --> 02:28:46.117
WE ALWAYS TAKE THE LETTERS?

02:28:46.183 --> 02:28:47.752
THAT COME IN SO IF YOU HAVEN'T

02:28:47.818 --> 02:28:49.420
SUBMIT ONE YOU SHOULD WE WILL

02:28:49.487 --> 02:28:51.555
THANK YOU.

02:28:51.622 --> 02:28:52.890
ANYTIME BUT YES.

02:28:52.957 --> 02:28:53.658
SYSTEM.

02:28:53.724 --> 02:28:54.659
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS

02:28:54.725 --> 02:28:56.127
AND DISCUSSION IN LIGHT OF THE

02:28:56.193 --> 02:28:57.962
DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD YES

02:28:58.029 --> 02:28:58.696
BECAUSE IF WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:28:58.763 --> 02:28:59.797
RECIDIVISM CARRILLO REALLY

02:28:59.864 --> 02:29:02.566
LOOKING AT PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT

02:29:02.633 --> 02:29:05.403
TO BE EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE

02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:08.139
PRISON. TO IGNORE THAT --

02:29:08.205 --> 02:29:10.341
HISTORIC SYSTEMIC.

02:29:10.408 --> 02:29:12.643
CULTURE THAT HAS BEEN THERE THAT

02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:14.178
THAT IF YOU EVER BEEN IN THE

02:29:14.245 --> 02:29:15.880
PRESIDENT I CERTAINLY HAVE IT

02:29:15.946 --> 02:29:17.782
GETS TALKED ABOUT SORT OF IN THE

02:29:17.848 --> 02:29:18.916
SHADOWS.

02:29:18.983 --> 02:29:22.019
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN STAFF DO

02:29:22.086 --> 02:29:24.455
YOU SEEM TO BE VERY WILLING TO

02:29:24.522 --> 02:29:26.324
DE HUMANIZE SOME OF THE THE THE

02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:27.792
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE.

02:29:27.858 --> 02:29:29.427
SO FOR THE ONE HAND WE'RE SAYING

02:29:29.493 --> 02:29:30.461
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT PROGRAM

02:29:30.528 --> 02:29:31.796
OVERLOOKED RECIDIVISM WE'RE

02:29:31.862 --> 02:29:33.798
GONNA LOOK AT THE SYSTEM AND TRY

02:29:33.864 --> 02:29:35.733
AND IMPROVE THEIR LIVES ON THE

02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:37.134
OTHER HAND WE IGNORE.

02:29:37.201 --> 02:29:40.805
THE THE INHUMANE TREATMENTS AND

02:29:40.871 --> 02:29:41.706
THE DIFFICULTY THAT SOME OF

02:29:41.772 --> 02:29:43.574
THESE PRISONERS HAVE WHEN

02:29:43.641 --> 02:29:45.309
THEY'RE INSIDE WHY WOULD THEY

02:29:45.376 --> 02:29:46.911
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAMS

02:29:46.977 --> 02:29:48.813
WHY WOULD THEY FEEL.

02:29:48.879 --> 02:29:49.880
THAT THE CAN.

02:29:49.947 --> 02:29:52.350
CULTURE IS CONDUCIVE TO SOLVING

02:29:52.416 --> 02:29:54.752
THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE SO I

02:29:54.819 --> 02:29:56.320
AM GLAD CDC OURS IS SERIOUS

02:29:56.387 --> 02:29:57.955
ABOUT THAT A TAKE YOUR WORD FOR

02:29:58.022 --> 02:29:59.256
IT AS WELL.

02:29:59.323 --> 02:30:01.525
BUT THERE'S ALSO THIS A

02:30:01.592 --> 02:30:03.260
SIGNIFICANT CULTURE CHANGE

02:30:03.327 --> 02:30:04.595
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY

02:30:04.662 --> 02:30:06.964
DIFFICULT TO CHANGE INSIDE SO I

02:30:07.031 --> 02:30:08.332
THINK IF THERE ARE PROPOSALS IF

02:30:08.399 --> 02:30:09.233
THERE ARE THINGS.

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:10.401
THAT WE COULD AND SHOULD BE

02:30:10.468 --> 02:30:12.470
LOOKING AT IT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:14.004
THEM RIGHT AWAY.

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:15.639
WE NEED TO OUR OUR OBLIGATIONS

02:30:15.706 --> 02:30:17.675
OVERSIGHT THIS IS PART OF OUR

02:30:17.742 --> 02:30:19.276
OVERSIGHT WE CAN CHANGE THE

02:30:19.343 --> 02:30:21.379
AUTHORITIES THAT THE IT HAS WE

02:30:21.445 --> 02:30:23.414
CAN TAKE SOME OF THOSE STEPS BUT

02:30:23.481 --> 02:30:24.615
IN THE MEANTIME.

02:30:24.682 --> 02:30:25.716
IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A

02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:28.052
QUESTION ABOUT RESOURCES FINE WE

02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:29.720
KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THAT.

02:30:29.787 --> 02:30:32.623
BUT IN ORDER TO PREVENT SOME.

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:34.959
MORE CATASTROPHIC EFFECT OF

02:30:35.025 --> 02:30:35.693
HAVING.

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:37.428
THE HAPPENING INSIDE THIS IS AN

02:30:37.495 --> 02:30:38.896
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT

02:30:38.963 --> 02:30:40.965
WHAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES CAN BE

02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:42.233
DONE.

02:30:42.299 --> 02:30:43.768
EXTRA REVIEWS.

02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:46.437
BUILD BACK SOME CREDIBILITY WITH

02:30:46.504 --> 02:30:47.938
BOTH WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE BUT

02:30:48.005 --> 02:30:50.241
ALSO WITHIN THE POPULATION THAT

02:30:50.307 --> 02:30:52.042
YOU'RE SERVING AND MANAGING.

02:30:52.109 --> 02:30:53.244
THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEND THEM

02:30:53.310 --> 02:30:56.447
[inaudible] TO TO LOOK AT HOW

02:30:56.514 --> 02:30:58.749
THEY CAN ADDRESS THEIR OWN LIVES

02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:00.084
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM

02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:00.551
TO DO.

02:31:00.618 --> 02:31:03.621
AND THEN REDUCE RECIDIVISM GET

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:04.889
BACK IN THE COMMUNITY TO

02:31:04.955 --> 02:31:06.023
HEALTHIER WAY.

02:31:06.090 --> 02:31:08.025
IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO CHANGE THE

02:31:08.092 --> 02:31:10.027
CULTURE INSIDE THEY HAVE NO

02:31:10.094 --> 02:31:11.228
INCENTIVE THEY'RE AFRAID TO GO

02:31:11.295 --> 02:31:12.963
DO THAT SO THESE ARE PART PARCEL

02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:15.299
OF REALLY THE SAME CONVERSATION.

02:31:15.366 --> 02:31:16.600
THAT WE'RE HAVING AND IT'S

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:17.802
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:20.938
ADDRESSED REALLY AS PART OF THE

02:31:21.005 --> 02:31:23.274
ONGOING LOOK AND BEFORE THIS

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:25.176
WHAT PROBABLY IS IT CRISIS LEVEL

02:31:25.242 --> 02:31:27.111
BUT BEFORE IT GETS EVEN WORSE OR

02:31:27.178 --> 02:31:28.446
THERE'S ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT

02:31:28.512 --> 02:31:30.014
CLASS ACTION SUIT OR SOMETHING

02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:30.915
THAT'S GOING.

02:31:30.981 --> 02:31:33.250
TO REALLY FORCE US TO LOOK AT

02:31:33.317 --> 02:31:34.418
THIS MORE DIFFERENTLY LET'S TAKE

02:31:34.485 --> 02:31:35.953
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT IT

02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:36.887
DIFFERENTLY NOW.

02:31:36.954 --> 02:31:39.490
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO SEE WHAT.

02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:41.926
WHAT CHANGES NEED TO HAPPEN?

02:31:41.992 --> 02:31:45.196
INSIDE BECAUSE IT'S ALL OF OUR

02:31:45.262 --> 02:31:45.996
COMMON GOAL. TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:31:46.063 --> 02:31:47.898
THE SYSTEM IS WORKING AS

02:31:47.965 --> 02:31:48.766
RESPECTFUL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:31:48.833 --> 02:31:50.167
IN THEIR THEIR THERE FOR A

02:31:50.234 --> 02:31:51.735
REASON ABSOLUTELY THEY'RE

02:31:51.802 --> 02:31:53.337
THEY'RE NOT BY THEIR OWN CHOICE

02:31:53.404 --> 02:31:54.505
THAT DOESN'T MEAN.

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:56.073
THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THEM

02:31:56.140 --> 02:31:58.342
BEING TREATED AS ANYTHING LESS

02:31:58.409 --> 02:31:59.743
THAN HUMAN.

02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:00.377
THEY'RE GONNA PAY THEIR DAD BUT

02:32:00.444 --> 02:32:03.280
WE HOPE SAYS IS GOING TO

02:32:03.347 --> 02:32:04.748
REHABILITATE THEM IT'S GOING TO

02:32:04.815 --> 02:32:06.150
GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. TO

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:08.352
CHANGE.

02:32:08.419 --> 02:32:10.421
FIX WHAT THEY NEED TO FIX INSIDE

02:32:10.488 --> 02:32:12.022
A COME OUT AND BE PRODUCTIVE

02:32:12.089 --> 02:32:13.324
MEMBERS OF SOCIETY.

02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:16.093
RATHER THAN JUST RUN THROUGH THE

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:17.995
MILL THAT SOMETIMES PRISONS HAVE

02:32:18.062 --> 02:32:19.797
THE REPUTATION OF BEING AND AND

02:32:19.864 --> 02:32:21.765
SHOWS UP IN ALL WHO

02:32:21.832 --> 02:32:23.734
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT.

02:32:23.801 --> 02:32:25.569
WHAT WE WHAT WE NEED TO EMULATE?

02:32:25.636 --> 02:32:26.804
SO SICK THIS IS OPPORTUNITY

02:32:26.871 --> 02:32:28.772
LET'S ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ANY

02:32:28.839 --> 02:32:30.274
PROPOSALS ANY THOUGHTS I THINK

02:32:30.341 --> 02:32:31.709
THIS COMMITTEES HAPPY TO

02:32:31.775 --> 02:32:33.010
ENTERTAIN.

02:32:33.077 --> 02:32:34.478
BE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT BUDGET

02:32:34.545 --> 02:32:35.813
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT

02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:37.948
ADDING RESOURCES WE HAVE TO HAVE

02:32:38.015 --> 02:32:39.783
A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THOSE

02:32:39.850 --> 02:32:41.385
RESOURCES ARE GONNA HAVE A FACT.

02:32:41.452 --> 02:32:44.355
AND HAVE AFFECT NOW AND AND LEAD

02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:46.090
INTO THE RECIDIVISM CONVERSATION

02:32:46.156 --> 02:32:48.325
THAT THAT WERE THAT WERE ALSO

02:32:48.392 --> 02:32:50.561
HAVING AND REALLY HAVE THE

02:32:50.628 --> 02:32:52.463
IMPACT OF REHABILITATION THAT WE

02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:54.732
HELP THE PRISON SYSTEMS.

02:32:54.798 --> 02:32:56.400
ARE AND AND REALLY CAMBY.

02:32:56.467 --> 02:32:58.469
I AGREE WITH I AGREE WITH THE

02:32:58.536 --> 02:33:00.237
ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK --

02:33:00.304 --> 02:33:02.072
ONE OF THE CHANGES IN THE LAST

02:33:02.139 --> 02:33:03.274
BUDGET WAS IN OUR STAFF TRAINING.

02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:05.242
AND WE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL WEEK

02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:07.177
AT OUR BASIC TRAINING ACADEMY TO

02:33:07.244 --> 02:33:09.380
FOCUS ON THE REHABILITATIVE

02:33:09.446 --> 02:33:10.714
EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE

02:33:10.781 --> 02:33:11.916
INSTITUTIONS.

02:33:11.982 --> 02:33:13.684
AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:33:13.751 --> 02:33:15.019
IT WE WE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:33:15.085 --> 02:33:17.054
OUR STAFF AND UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:33:17.121 --> 02:33:17.555
WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

02:33:17.621 --> 02:33:18.522
POPULATION.

02:33:18.589 --> 02:33:19.823
THE ON THE BASIC PEACE OFFER

02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:21.191
TRAINING IN THE SAFETY IN THE

02:33:21.258 --> 02:33:22.359
COUNTING AND ALL THE ALL THE

02:33:22.426 --> 02:33:24.061
BASIC THINGS OF RUNNING A PRISON.

02:33:24.128 --> 02:33:25.863
WE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE WERE

02:33:25.930 --> 02:33:28.432
DOING A GOOD YOU WITH THE STAFF

02:33:28.499 --> 02:33:30.568
REMINDING THEM WHY THEY DECIDED

02:33:30.634 --> 02:33:31.602
TO JOIN THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:33.070
CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION.

02:33:33.137 --> 02:33:34.305
SO WITH THAT ADDITIONAL WEEK

02:33:34.371 --> 02:33:35.573
WERE FOCUSING ON THE

02:33:35.639 --> 02:33:37.007
REHABILITATED REHABILITATION

02:33:37.074 --> 02:33:37.975
THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE

02:33:38.042 --> 02:33:39.610
POPULATION AND HOW IMPORTANT A

02:33:39.677 --> 02:33:40.544
ROLE.

02:33:40.611 --> 02:33:42.713
THAT THE OFFICER PLAYS IN THAT

02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:44.415
AND THAT THEY CAN BE A CATALYST

02:33:44.481 --> 02:33:45.349
FOR GOOD.

02:33:45.416 --> 02:33:46.717
WHILE MAINTAINING SAFETY

02:33:46.784 --> 02:33:48.118
SECURITY BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T

02:33:48.185 --> 02:33:49.453
HAVE SAFETY SECURITY YOU CAN'T

02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:52.356
HAVE ROBUST REHABILITATION OR

02:33:52.423 --> 02:33:52.957
PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE I WANNA

02:33:53.023 --> 02:33:53.724
COME.

02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:55.659
SORE TRAINING STAFF IN THAT ON

02:33:55.726 --> 02:33:57.428
TOP OF THEIR OWN WELLNESS.

02:33:57.494 --> 02:33:58.762
FOCUSING ON THAT STAFF WELLNESS

02:33:58.829 --> 02:34:00.230
TO WELL THIS PIECE IS IMPORTANT

02:34:00.297 --> 02:34:01.198
BECAUSE AFTER YEARS.

02:34:01.265 --> 02:34:03.133
PEOPLE FORGET THE LIFESTYLE THAT

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:04.435
THEY'RE LIVING AND THEY HAVE TO

02:34:04.501 --> 02:34:05.603
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

02:34:05.669 --> 02:34:07.004
AND IF THEY LOSE FOCUS OF WHAT

02:34:07.071 --> 02:34:08.505
THEY'RE DOING THEN --

02:34:08.572 --> 02:34:09.473
THEY IN TURN CAN BECOME

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.008
DISGRUNTLED DISMAYED AND START

02:34:11.075 --> 02:34:12.343
LOOKING AT THIS JOB IS NOTHING

02:34:12.409 --> 02:34:13.677
MORE THAN JUST WAREHOUSING

02:34:13.744 --> 02:34:14.645
INDIVIDUALS.

02:34:14.712 --> 02:34:16.213
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:18.215
WE ALSO ADDED AN ADDITIONAL DAY

02:34:18.282 --> 02:34:19.249
IN THE ANNUAL BLOCK TRAINING

02:34:19.316 --> 02:34:20.584
THAT STAFF GET ON AN ANNUAL

02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:21.986
BASIS AND WE'RE FOCUSING WITHOUT

02:34:22.052 --> 02:34:23.053
ADDITIONAL DAY.

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:25.155
THOSE TWO THINGS ALSO REMINDING

02:34:25.222 --> 02:34:26.624
THEM OF THEIR REHABILITATION

02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:28.325
RESPONSIBILITIES BUT THEN IT

02:34:28.392 --> 02:34:29.627
ALSO GIVES A TIME FOR THE

02:34:29.693 --> 02:34:31.362
EXPECTATION TO GET GIVEN ABOUT

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:33.564
ACCOUNTABILITY ABOUT THE ROLE

02:34:33.631 --> 02:34:34.932
THAT THEY PLAY IN REHAB --

02:34:34.999 --> 02:34:36.967
AT IT IT DIDN'T TO GET LOST ON

02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:38.602
ME THE COMMENTERS THAT MADE SOME

02:34:38.669 --> 02:34:40.571
COMMENTS ABOUT HOUSE SOME OF MY

02:34:40.638 --> 02:34:41.605
SOME OF THE STAFF IN THE PRISONS

02:34:41.672 --> 02:34:42.873
HAVE BEEN BOUGHT INTO IT.

02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:44.942
I TOOK NOTE OF THAT SO WE NEED

02:34:45.009 --> 02:34:45.542
TO A BETTER JOB AT THAT BUT I

02:34:45.609 --> 02:34:46.310
THINK.

02:34:46.377 --> 02:34:49.380
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ADDRESSING

02:34:49.446 --> 02:34:52.449
THE TRAIN HERE TO DO MORE THAN

02:34:52.516 --> 02:34:53.917
JUST SHOW UP AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:34:53.984 --> 02:34:55.886
THE SAME AMOUNT TO INMATES ARE

02:34:55.953 --> 02:34:56.487
THERE THAT WERE THERE WHEN YOU

02:34:56.553 --> 02:34:57.688
SHOWED UP.

02:34:57.755 --> 02:34:59.356
YOU HAVE A REHABILITATION ROLE

02:34:59.423 --> 02:35:00.658
AND THAT IS TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH

02:35:00.724 --> 02:35:02.760
RESPECT WITH DIGNITY --

02:35:02.826 --> 02:35:03.694
TO MAINTAIN A SAFE AND SECURE

02:35:03.761 --> 02:35:05.929
PLACE SO PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE

02:35:05.996 --> 02:35:07.831
IN REHABILITATION --

02:35:07.898 --> 02:35:08.799
I ALSO DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS

02:35:08.866 --> 02:35:10.034
TABLE WITH WITH THE FACT THAT

02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:11.135
I'M NOT AS CONCERNED AS THERE

02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:12.536
ABOUT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

02:35:12.603 --> 02:35:14.038
STORES I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEM I

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:15.305
AM TROUBLED BY THEM.

02:35:15.372 --> 02:35:16.440
AND I DO WANT --

02:35:16.507 --> 02:35:18.442
TO MAKE THEM STORIES THAT WE

02:35:18.509 --> 02:35:21.612
DON'T HEAR ABOUT THEM ANYMORE.

02:35:21.679 --> 02:35:22.212
AND I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT

02:35:22.279 --> 02:35:25.115
AND I I KNOW YOU ARE COMMITTED

02:35:25.182 --> 02:35:26.550
TO WORKING ON THIS BUT SOME OF

02:35:26.617 --> 02:35:28.285
THE CHANGES ARE GOING TO BE VERY

02:35:28.352 --> 02:35:29.853
DIFFICULT IN FACT WHAT I'VE

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:31.588
TOWARD SOME OF THE PRISONS.

02:35:31.655 --> 02:35:33.590
THERE ARE SOME OFFICERS THAT

02:35:33.657 --> 02:35:35.125
WE'RE ENCOURAGED NOT TO TALK TO

02:35:35.192 --> 02:35:36.894
AND THOSE ARE ONES WHO HAVE NOT

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:38.862
BOUGHT INTO THE REHABILITATION

02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:39.730
MISSION AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE

02:35:39.797 --> 02:35:40.364
THERE.

02:35:40.431 --> 02:35:42.599
AND THEY SEE THAT ROLE IS VERY

02:35:42.666 --> 02:35:45.135
DIFFERENT THAT'S NOT CONDUCIVE

02:35:45.202 --> 02:35:46.470
TO THE CHANGES WE NEED TO SEE IN

02:35:46.537 --> 02:35:47.504
THE SYSTEM.

02:35:47.571 --> 02:35:49.773
AND TO THE THE THE CHANGES WE

02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:51.375
ARE ASKING THE PRISONERS

02:35:51.442 --> 02:35:53.343
THEMSELVES TO GO THROUGH FOR SO.

02:35:53.410 --> 02:35:54.378
THAT'S WHY I SAY THIS IS THE

02:35:54.445 --> 02:35:56.814
SAME CONVERSATION THIS IS PART

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:58.082
AND PARCEL.

02:35:58.148 --> 02:35:59.583
TO TO REALLY ALL OF THE ABOVE IF

02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:00.718
WE IF WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE

02:36:00.784 --> 02:36:02.319
THINGS I I DO APPRECIATE YOUR

02:36:02.386 --> 02:36:03.887
COMMITMENT TO THIS.

02:36:03.954 --> 02:36:05.389
BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE SOME OF

02:36:05.456 --> 02:36:06.724
VERY HARD WORK.

02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:08.258
RASKIN PRISONERS TO GO THROUGH A

02:36:08.325 --> 02:36:10.494
LOT TO ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES

02:36:10.561 --> 02:36:11.361
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE

02:36:11.428 --> 02:36:14.031
CULTURE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE

02:36:14.098 --> 02:36:17.101
MATCHING THAT LEVEL OF CHANGES

02:36:17.167 --> 02:36:19.536
WHILE I AGREE.

02:36:19.603 --> 02:36:21.739
WELCOME.

02:36:21.805 --> 02:36:22.773
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR --

02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:23.907
JUST.

02:36:23.974 --> 02:36:24.441
TO QUICK QUESTION FOR THE

02:36:24.508 --> 02:36:25.375
SECRETARY --

02:36:25.442 --> 02:36:28.846
SO BASED ON THIS SITUATION.

02:36:28.912 --> 02:36:31.048
SORT OF ALLUDED THAT YOU CHANGES

02:36:31.115 --> 02:36:32.716
SOME POLICIES CAN YOU WALK US

02:36:32.783 --> 02:36:33.851
THROUGH THOSE POLICY CHANGES AND

02:36:33.917 --> 02:36:34.585
IF.

02:36:34.651 --> 02:36:36.386
YOU CAN SURE HOW THOSE WERE

02:36:36.453 --> 02:36:37.921
IMPLEMENTED WITH THOSE DONE IN A

02:36:37.988 --> 02:36:39.423
IN ORDER IN A MEMO WE'D LIKE TO

02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:40.691
SEE A COPY OF THAT AS WELL.

02:36:40.758 --> 02:36:42.159
WE WE CAN GET YOU SOME OF THOSE

02:36:42.226 --> 02:36:43.327
DOCUMENTS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE

02:36:43.393 --> 02:36:44.862
BIGGEST CHANGES LIKE I SAID

02:36:44.928 --> 02:36:45.963
EARLIER.

02:36:46.029 --> 02:36:47.331
WAS MOVING THE STAFF COMPLAINT

02:36:47.397 --> 02:36:49.333
PROCESS OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON

02:36:49.399 --> 02:36:50.634
AND PUTTING IT UNDER.

02:36:50.701 --> 02:36:52.736
OUR OFFICE OF OVERSIGHT AND

02:36:52.803 --> 02:36:54.138
RESEARCH AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:36:54.204 --> 02:36:55.606
AND THAT'S REALLY THAT'S UNDER

02:36:55.672 --> 02:36:57.307
THE UMBRELLA OF WORLD OF

02:36:57.374 --> 02:36:58.842
INTERNAL AFFAIRS EXISTS.

02:36:58.909 --> 02:37:00.544
SO IT'S OUT OF THE DIVISION OF

02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:02.513
ADULT INSTITUTIONS I THINK FOR

02:37:02.579 --> 02:37:04.248
THAT FOR US THAT IS --

02:37:04.314 --> 02:37:05.849
THAT IS A BIG CHANGE BECAUSE

02:37:05.916 --> 02:37:07.451
WHAT IT DOES IS IT.

02:37:07.518 --> 02:37:11.455
PUTS A DIFFERENT SET OF EYES ON

02:37:11.522 --> 02:37:12.456
THE PRODUCT IS BEING GENERATED.

02:37:12.523 --> 02:37:13.891
IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE IN THE END

02:37:13.957 --> 02:37:15.793
THE THE THE CONCERN THAT THE

02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:17.194
WARDEN CAN DICTATE HOW THIS

02:37:17.261 --> 02:37:18.695
INQUIRY GOES ONE WAY OR THE

02:37:18.762 --> 02:37:19.429
OTHER.

02:37:19.496 --> 02:37:21.231
IT'S REALLY NOT UP TO SOMEONE

02:37:21.298 --> 02:37:22.900
ELSE A DIFFERENT DIRECTOR ALL

02:37:22.966 --> 02:37:24.535
TOGETHER TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

02:37:24.601 --> 02:37:25.269
THERE ARE NEGOTIATION PIECES

02:37:25.335 --> 02:37:28.172
THAT HAVE TO GO WITH --

02:37:28.238 --> 02:37:30.040
WE HAVE BEEN IN NEGOTIATIONS

02:37:30.107 --> 02:37:30.641
WITH THEM AND AND THEY'VE BEEN

02:37:30.707 --> 02:37:31.809
PROMISING.

02:37:31.875 --> 02:37:33.577
WERE THERE ANY OTHER CHANGES

02:37:33.644 --> 02:37:35.579
THAT THAT WERE DONE.

02:37:35.646 --> 02:37:36.947
OUTSIDE OF THIS --

02:37:37.014 --> 02:37:38.549
THERE'S A TRAINING COMPONENT SO

02:37:38.615 --> 02:37:40.250
WE DID TRAIN THE STAFF AND POST

02:37:40.317 --> 02:37:42.152
CERTIFIED COURSES ON

02:37:42.219 --> 02:37:44.121
INVESTIGATION WE HAVE --

02:37:44.188 --> 02:37:44.922
TRAINING THAT WE STILL HAVE TO

02:37:44.988 --> 02:37:46.056
DO.

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:47.224
BUT WE DO HAVE A CERTAIN SET OF

02:37:47.291 --> 02:37:48.659
LIEUTENANT TO BODY BENT TO THAT

02:37:48.725 --> 02:37:49.726
TRAINING AT OPPOSE CERTIFIED

02:37:49.793 --> 02:37:51.528
COURSE WHICH IS BEYOND WHAT WE

02:37:51.595 --> 02:37:54.565
TYPICALLY TRAIN ON ATTACK AT THE

02:37:54.631 --> 02:37:55.933
PRISON LAW OFFICE SOME.

02:37:55.999 --> 02:37:57.367
MAYBE NOT A COMPLETE.

02:37:57.434 --> 02:37:59.770
AGREEMENT YEP NO GOOD GOOD

02:37:59.837 --> 02:38:02.840
FACIAL RECOGNITION THERE --

02:38:02.906 --> 02:38:04.274
YEAH WE BELIEVE THAT.

02:38:04.341 --> 02:38:05.776
THE CHANGE THAT THEY MADE OF

02:38:05.843 --> 02:38:07.110
TAKING IT OUT OF THE INSTITUTION

02:38:07.177 --> 02:38:09.112
AND PUTTING AN END TO THIS OTHER

02:38:09.179 --> 02:38:11.615
DIVISION IS ONLY A HALF A STEP

02:38:11.682 --> 02:38:13.584
IT'S NOT REALLY SUFFICIENT.

02:38:13.650 --> 02:38:14.651
FORCE.

02:38:14.718 --> 02:38:16.353
THE BEST STEP IS THEY HAVE AN

02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:18.455
OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS WHICH

02:38:18.522 --> 02:38:20.724
ACTUALLY FOR CASES THAT GO TO GO

02:38:20.791 --> 02:38:22.092
TO THEM I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES

02:38:22.159 --> 02:38:23.527
DOES A VERY GOOD JOB OF AN

02:38:23.594 --> 02:38:25.095
INVESTIGATION.

02:38:25.162 --> 02:38:28.932
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE KING

02:38:28.999 --> 02:38:30.701
THESE THE TENANTS ARE POSITIONS

02:38:30.767 --> 02:38:32.569
AND PUTTING THEM IN THE A A

02:38:32.636 --> 02:38:34.371
WHICH AS RITA MENTIONED AS A

02:38:34.438 --> 02:38:36.073
SEPARATE TRACK THEY'RE NOT

02:38:36.139 --> 02:38:38.008
THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE

02:38:38.075 --> 02:38:39.776
INSTITUTIONAL CULTURE.

02:38:39.843 --> 02:38:40.911
AND THEY'RE ALREADY DOING A GOOD

02:38:40.978 --> 02:38:42.646
JOB TO HAVE A GOOD MODEL SO USE

02:38:42.713 --> 02:38:45.015
THE MODEL EXPANDED A LITTLE TOO

02:38:45.082 --> 02:38:46.416
TO THE INSTITUTIONS.

02:38:46.483 --> 02:38:48.318
AND YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH OF BLYTON

02:38:48.385 --> 02:38:49.786
BETTER LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS

02:38:49.853 --> 02:38:51.855
SOME THAT SECRETARY WHY WHY

02:38:51.922 --> 02:38:53.690
WEREN'T THEY BE DIRECTED INTO.

02:38:53.757 --> 02:38:54.925
NUMBER ONE THERE THERE IS A

02:38:54.992 --> 02:38:58.462
CONCERN FOR THAT LINE EXISTS

02:38:58.528 --> 02:38:59.997
BETWEEN IN KOREAN INVESTIGATION.

02:39:00.063 --> 02:39:00.931
SO IN CRANE WERE WERE FOR OUR

02:39:00.998 --> 02:39:02.366
FACT FINDING WE'RE TRYING TO

02:39:02.432 --> 02:39:03.533
GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:05.135
CAN TO DETERMINE.

02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:07.371
WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO OPEN A

02:39:07.437 --> 02:39:10.707
FULL INVESTIGATION FOR WE WE

02:39:10.774 --> 02:39:12.743
START PUTTING PEOPLE UNDER --

02:39:12.809 --> 02:39:15.746
UNDER BLY BARGER UNDER OATH SO

02:39:15.812 --> 02:39:18.916
THEY CAN GET ON TAPE AND RECORD --

02:39:18.982 --> 02:39:20.651
FOR US WE WE BELIEVE THAT WE

02:39:20.717 --> 02:39:23.587
WANTED TO APPROACH THIS THAT --

02:39:23.654 --> 02:39:25.455
SINCE IT IS UNDER THE OFFICE OF

02:39:25.522 --> 02:39:27.658
INTERNAL OVERSIGHT RESEARCH THAT

02:39:27.724 --> 02:39:28.625
THE TRAINING THAT THE STAFF

02:39:28.692 --> 02:39:30.560
RECEIVED AS THE EXACT TRAINING

02:39:30.627 --> 02:39:32.796
THAT'S UNDER THAT DIRECTOR --

02:39:32.863 --> 02:39:34.598
WE DON'T BELIEVE THE SEVENTH

02:39:34.665 --> 02:39:35.732
MOVING AT THE MEANING THE UNDER

02:39:35.799 --> 02:39:39.202
SIX EXCUSE ME SINCE THE HOURS

02:39:39.269 --> 02:39:39.403
LATE.

02:39:39.469 --> 02:39:40.837
HOME.

02:39:40.904 --> 02:39:41.872
IF YOU SAW THE OF THE INSPECTOR

02:39:41.939 --> 02:39:43.273
GENERAL'S REPORT WRITING IT'S

02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:44.942
BASICALLY SAYING SO YOU SO

02:39:45.008 --> 02:39:45.809
YOU'RE SAYING THE INQUIRY DOES

02:39:45.876 --> 02:39:46.677
NOT TO BE DONE BY INTERNAL

02:39:46.743 --> 02:39:47.644
AFFAIRS BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE

02:39:47.711 --> 02:39:48.612
INVEST.

02:39:48.679 --> 02:39:50.013
WHAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S

DOING IT IN THEIR EVERYDAY WORK

03:00:53.776 --> 03:00:54.977
THAT'S TRUE BUT THEY RECEIVE

03:00:55.044 --> 03:00:57.513
COMPLAINTS OBVIOUSLY FROM AN

03:00:57.580 --> 03:00:59.448
MAYES THROUGHOUT THE THE STATE.

03:00:59.515 --> 03:01:00.583

ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE SAID IT TO

03:01:28.544 --> 03:01:29.245

BUT I GET A WEEKLY WE ROLL UP

03:01:33.916 --> 03:01:35.184
FROM THE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE OF

ANY ISSUES THAT THEY'VE

03:01:36.418 --> 03:01:38.220

LESS SEVERE I I DON'T KNOW WHAT

03:01:51.066 --> 03:01:53.402
THE RIGHT.

03:01:53.469 --> 03:01:54.503
WAY TO ASK THE QUESTION IS AT

03:01:54.570 --> 03:01:54.770
THE MEAN.

03:01:54.837 --> 03:01:55.771
THIS IS A LIFE.

03:01:55.838 --> 03:01:57.139
THE SAME KIND OF COMPLAINTS WERE

03:01:57.206 --> 03:01:59.508
SEEN HERE ARE THE SORT OF MORE

03:01:59.575 --> 03:02:01.110
MINOR COMPLAINTS BUT WHAT I

03:02:01.176 --> 03:02:02.278
TYPICALLY SEE FROM THE OMBUDSMAN

03:02:02.344 --> 03:02:04.480
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T ASKED ME IN

03:02:04.546 --> 03:02:06.348
PARTICULAR OF OR HAVE THEY

03:02:06.415 --> 03:02:06.882
PROVIDED ME ANYTHING WITH

03:02:06.949 --> 03:02:07.950
THERE'S ALLOCATION OF STAFF

03:02:08.017 --> 03:02:09.018
MISCONDUCT.

03:02:09.084 --> 03:02:10.486
IS USUALLY EITHER AROUND THE

03:02:10.552 --> 03:02:12.187
INMATE DIDN'T GET SOME THAT HE

03:02:12.254 --> 03:02:13.689
SHOULD HAVE HAD COMING OR

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:15.291
THERE'S A PROPERTY ISSUE OR

03:02:15.357 --> 03:02:16.625
SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR IN THEY

03:02:16.692 --> 03:02:17.960
DIDN'T GET RELEASED ON A PROGRAM.

03:02:18.027 --> 03:02:19.895
SO I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM

03:02:19.962 --> 03:02:21.764
THEM IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHETHER.

03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:23.065
INMATES HAVE ALLEGATIONS OF

03:02:23.132 --> 03:02:24.633

USE OF FORCE OR OTHER ISSUES.

03:02:27.436 --> 03:02:29.638
WITH THE ITS INMATES GO TO THEM

03:02:29.705 --> 03:02:30.272
WITH THOSE KINDS OF COMPLAINTS.

03:02:30.339 --> 03:02:31.840
YES THEY DO ALL THE TIME BECAUSE

03:02:31.907 --> 03:02:32.675
THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN SAN

03:02:32.741 --> 03:02:33.976
CONFIDENTIAL MAIL TO THE

03:02:34.043 --> 03:02:35.177
OMBUDSMAN ALSO AND WHEN THE

03:02:35.244 --> 03:02:36.211
OMBUDSMAN'S ARE OUT AN

03:02:36.278 --> 03:02:37.246

THERE ARE OTHER INSTITUTION FOR

03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:39.648
AN ENTIRE WEEK.

03:02:39.715 --> 03:02:40.683
AND SO THEY WALKING THE TALK

03:02:40.749 --> 03:02:43.185
WITH THE POPULATION.

03:02:43.252 --> 03:02:44.186
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO

03:02:44.253 --> 03:02:45.754
ASK THEM SPECIFICALLY THAT

03:02:45.821 --> 03:02:47.089
QUESTION I GET IT BACK TO US

03:02:47.156 --> 03:02:48.724
WHETHER THERE IS ADDITIONAL.

03:02:48.791 --> 03:02:51.060
YES I CAN DO THAT --

03:02:51.126 --> 03:02:53.962
MY SUGGESTION IS IS THE

03:02:54.029 --> 03:02:55.431
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS INVITE

03:02:55.497 --> 03:02:57.499
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO GO IN

03:02:59.335 --> 03:03:00.102
TO SEE.

03:03:00.169 --> 03:03:01.904
IF ANYTHING DIFFERENT HAS

03:03:01.970 --> 03:03:03.072
OCCURRED.

03:03:03.138 --> 03:03:04.640
IS IS IS THERE A REGULAR FOLLOW

OTHER REPORTS THAT WE DO.

03:03:10.679 --> 03:03:11.680
WE GET A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN

03:03:11.747 --> 03:03:13.048
FROM THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE IT'S

03:03:13.115 --> 03:03:14.717
PART OF OUR JURISDICTION TO

03:03:14.783 --> 03:03:16.185
PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO THAT AREA.

03:03:16.251 --> 03:03:18.287
IN THIS INSTANCE WE WERE INVITED

03:03:24.593 --> 03:03:25.361
TO ASK FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION

03:03:25.427 --> 03:03:27.296
PLAN OR TO GO BACK AND LOOK TO

03:03:29.498 --> 03:03:31.633
NO VISIBILITY ON WHAT'S ACTUALLY

WE HAVE SEEN A DECREASE IN THE

03:04:37.966 --> 03:04:38.967

AFTER THE REPORTS COME OUT I

03:04:58.454 --> 03:05:01.323
KNOW THAT MISTER SPECTER'S HAD

03:05:01.390 --> 03:05:03.258

03:09:58.153 --> 03:09:58.987
ALTHOUGH SOME OF IT WAS

03:09:59.054 --> 03:10:00.522

03:10:00.589 --> 03:10:02.691
THAT WE WERE GIVEN.

03:10:02.758 --> 03:10:06.895
BUT WE QUICKLY REALIZED THAT.

03:10:06.962 --> 03:10:09.331
NO ONE WANTED TO HEAR THAT.

03:10:09.397 --> 03:10:10.599
AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS

03:10:10.665 --> 03:10:12.334
AMOUNT OF RETALIATION AGAINST ME

03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:14.336
I RETIRED EARLY BASICALLY

03:10:14.402 --> 03:10:16.838

03:10:32.220 --> 03:10:34.022
AGAIN.

03:10:34.089 --> 03:10:35.190
AND NOTHING EVER REALLY SEEMS TO

03:10:35.257 --> 03:10:36.925
BE DONE ABOUT IT.

03:10:36.992 --> 03:10:38.927

IN NORTH MISTER SCOTT IT INTO

03:12:23.965 --> 03:12:26.434
THE LEGISLATURE --

03:12:26.501 --> 03:12:29.070
AFTER THE INCIDENTS AT HIGH

03:12:29.137 --> 03:12:30.305
DESERT --

03:12:30.372 --> 03:12:32.140

03:12:32.207 --> 03:12:33.308
TWO THOUSAND TEN THAT HE MADE

03:12:33.375 --> 03:12:35.310
PEOPLE AWARE OF AND I'M SORRY TO

03:12:35.377 --> 03:12:35.944
SAY.

03:12:36.011 --> 03:12:37.245
THAT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT

03:12:37.312 --> 03:12:38.813
THERE WAS REALLY LEGISLATIVE

03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:40.348
INTEREST AT THAT TIME.

03:12:40.415 --> 03:12:41.716
AND AS A RESULT THAT HAS

03:12:41.783 --> 03:12:44.519
AFFECTED MY ADVOCACY.

03:12:44.586 --> 03:12:48.256
AND IN FACT TODAY I DID GOOGLE --

03:12:48.323 --> 03:12:49.891

03:12:49.958 --> 03:12:52.727
AND INCIDENTS OF STAFF MISS

03:12:52.794 --> 03:12:55.363
CONTACT A TRYING.

03:12:55.430 --> 03:12:56.831
TO REFRESH MY MEMORY ABOUT WHEN

03:12:56.898 --> 03:12:57.499
I BROUGHT --

03:12:57.565 --> 03:12:59.200

LEGISLATURE BACK THEN AND A

03:13:00.835 --> 03:13:03.305
WHOLE SET OF NEW INCIDENTS.

03:13:03.371 --> 03:13:06.308
POPPED UP ON GOOGLE OF OF THINGS

03:13:06.374 --> 03:13:07.108
THAT IT HAPPENED --

03:13:07.175 --> 03:13:10.979
AFTER THAT OKAY BUT I I THINK

03:13:11.046 --> 03:13:13.281
THAT THE THING THAT.

03:13:13.348 --> 03:13:15.350
CONCERNS ME THE MOST --

03:13:15.417 --> 03:13:17.919
IS THE IMPACT THAT THIS DOES

03:13:17.986 --> 03:13:19.721
HAVE ON THE PRISON CULTURE --

03:13:19.788 --> 03:13:23.491
IT'S BASICALLY TELLING PRISONERS --

03:13:23.558 --> 03:13:26.461
THAT THEY DON'T MATTER --

03:13:26.528 --> 03:13:28.296
THAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS AND SO

03:13:28.363 --> 03:13:32.434
THEN WHY WOULD THEY BUY INTO --

03:13:32.500 --> 03:13:34.102
THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE MAKING --

03:13:34.169 --> 03:13:37.038
HERE TO TRANSFORM THE CULTURE

03:13:37.105 --> 03:13:39.174
AND MAKE PRISONERS PRISONS UP

03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:41.042
MORE REHABILITATED.

03:13:41.109 --> 03:13:42.410
THEN PUNITIVE ARE YOU AUTHORED A

03:13:42.477 --> 03:13:44.946
BILL COUPLE YEARS AGO AB TWENTY

03:13:45.013 --> 03:13:45.847
FIVE NINETY WHICH THE

03:13:45.914 --> 03:13:47.916
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ACT.

03:13:47.983 --> 03:13:50.218
WHICH SAID THAT THE PURPOSE.

03:13:50.285 --> 03:13:52.520
OF OF SENTENCING WOULD BE PUBLIC

03:13:52.587 --> 03:13:54.022
SAFETY.

03:13:54.089 --> 03:13:55.690
AS OPPOSED TO WHERE IT ALWAYS

03:13:55.757 --> 03:13:57.559

03:13:57.625 --> 03:13:59.194
PUNISHMENT --

03:13:59.260 --> 03:14:00.462

03:14:01.963 --> 03:14:03.365

THESE INVESTIGATIONS I DO HAVE

03:14:19.914 --> 03:14:21.483
