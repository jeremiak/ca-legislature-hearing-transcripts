ARE EXCHANGED COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE THESE FACILITIES OR WERE THESE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED THAT THE FACILITIES MUST HAVE UP TO NINE OR AT LEAST NINETY SIX HOURS OF BACKUP GENERATION. I IN CASE OF AN OUTAGE WHETHER CAUSED BY A NATURAL DISASTER OR PS PS AMOUNT. CURRENT REGULATIONS IN THE STATE ONLY REQUIRE NURSING HOMES TO PROVIDE VERY LIMITED BACKUP POWER FOR UP TO SIX HOURS. NOW THIS IS SIMPLY INSUFFICIENT AND A WEAK STANDARD THAT IS TRULY A RECIPE FOR DISASTER IN CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT CLIMATE OF EXTREME WEATHER. THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO CODIFY ALREADY EXISTING FEDERAL STANDARDS THAT ARE REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW BUT NOT UNDER STATE LAW. THE REQUIRED NURSING HOMES TO HAVE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF POWER TO PROTECT RESIDENTS HEALTH AND SAFETY AND MAINTAIN SAFE TEMPERATURES I THINK THIS IS CRITICAL O NOTE. FOR OUR SENSITIVE SENIOR POPULATION YOU CAN GET EXTREMELY HOT VERY DIFFICULT FOR SOME SENIORS TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST TO THAT HE'D- IT ALSO PROVIDES BACKUP POWER. FOR PARKS ENGINE AND FOR MEDICINE THAT NEED TO BE CAP AT AN APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURE. SO THESE ARE ALREADY EXISTING FEDERAL STANDARDS TO WHICH ALMOST ALL OF CALIFORNIA SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE SUBJECTED TO. BUT FOR THOSE MET THOSE ARE NURSING HOMES TO COME UNDER STATE REGULATION. THEY ONLY NOW ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SIX HOURS. THIS AGAIN MERELY CODIFIES THE FEDERAL STANDARD INTO STATE LAW AND ADDRESSES A SMALL NUMBER OF THESE HOMES HOWEVER THIS BILL THANKS TO AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE WORKED ON WITH YOU SHOULD FOR SOME REASON FEDERAL REGULATIONS BE CHANGED OR ELIMINATED. THOSE STANDARDS WILL BECOME THE LAW OF CALIFORNIA YOUR RESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTS TO REMOVE THEM OR NOT. OF HI I DON'T NEED I THINK TO EXPLAIN ANY FURTHER HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS IN AN ERA OF COVERT WHEN OUR SENIORS ARE UNDER SUCH STRESS IN PARTICULAR NURSING HOMES PEOPLE IN THOSE HOMES ARE SUBJECT. TO THESE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS NOW THE FIRE SEASON IS HERE. TO ADD THAT ON WE'RE PROBABLY OR MOST LIKELY WE WILL SEE. TRY TO STAY IN PLACE DURING THESE PSP **** OR DURING WILDFIRES BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATE WITH MOVING HESE FOLKS AND THE ISSUES OF CONGREGATE CARE SO IT BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE PASS THIS MEASURE. PROVIDING TESTING OUR OVER THE PHONE AND I HOPE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS ARE KAREN JONES THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN SERVICES.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF KIDS IN CALIFORNIA WILL DIE A PREMATURE DEATH AT THE HANDS OF BIG TOBACCO. WE ARE ALLOWING THEM TO HER AND KILL OUR KIDS WITH. MEN MEN. CANDY FLAVORED POISON. BE EASY. THIS BILL. TO THAT WOULD BE THE EASY WAY OUT THE WEEK EASY WAY OUT. END THAT IS WHAT BIG TOBACCO WILL TELL YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM. A BABY IN BILLING NOR BIG TOBACCO'S HISTORY OF DESTROYING AND DEVASTATING OUR COMMUNITIES. BABY ONLY IS A REGRESSIVE APPROACH THAT HURTS KIDS MORE THAN IT HELPED THEM IN UNDERCUTS POLICYMAKERS. AND KIDS IN ALL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED OR WILL SOON IN STRONG LOCAL RULES.THE RABBANI CIGARETTE USE BY YOUNG PEOPLE IS WHAT PHONE IT IS WHITE YEARS OF KLEINIAN USE. ALL FOR. THE YOUNG. TEEN ENSURE. I AM DISGUSTED AND TROUBLED BY THIS BUT NOT SURPRISED. BIG TOBACCO HAS PRAYED ON YOUTH FOR GENERATIONS LORRAINE OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING FALSE PROMISES OF SAFETY AND KID FRIENDLY FLAVOR. WE MUST BREAK TOBACCO BIG TOBACCO'S DEATH GRIP ON OUR CHILDREN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE THE EXPLOSIVE POPULARITY FLAVORED NICOTINE PRODUCTS AND THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN A NEW YOU. 8% ANY FORM SAY THEY STARTED WITH A FLAVORED PRODUCT. WHAT DREW THEM AND CONTINUE TO HOLD THEM WELL THE OVERALL OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF TEENS THAT USED TOBACCO REPORT THAT ITS FRUIT MENTHOL AND MINT FLAVOR. BIG TOBACCO SAYS FLAVORS LIKE HAWAIIAN PUNCH CATER TO ADULT CASES BUT THE DATA SHOWS THE FLAVOR TOBACCO USE IS STAND AMONG YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULT. MENTAL RICH TO GUARD IN THE- ANOTHER FLAVOR TO PRODUCTS THE HARSHNESS OF TOBACCO IN HOPE USERS INTO A LIFE THREATENING ADDICTION. FOR I GO FURTHER I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY I'M PRESSING FORWARD WITH THIS BE SEVEN NINETY THREE GIVEN EVERYTHING WE FACE DUE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I KNOW WE'VE ALL HAD TO WOULD REASSESS OUR PRIORITIES EMERGING EVIDENCE ABOUT SMOKING AND CORPORATE NINETEEN SHOT THE STOCKING CAN PUT PEOPLE AT GREATER RISK THE WORLD ORGAN DIVISION THIS. THE P. H. WORN TOBACCO USE CAN IN THE RISK OF SUFFERING THE MOST SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF COVERT NINETEEN. WE KNOW CONCLUSIVELY THAT SMOKING INCREASES RISK OF RESPIRATORY INFECTION. WEAKENS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND IS A MAJOR UNDERLYING CALL OF LUNG DISEASE HEART DISEASE AND DIE. THIS PANDEMIC COMPELS US TO URGE SMOKERS TO QUIT AND ESTABLISH POLICIES THAT INSURE NEVER PICK UP THE HABIT. IN THE FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE OF THE- INDUSTRIES TACTICS LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY THE TEAM IS AN AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED. BY THE RELATED ENTITY AND DEATH. OPPONENTS OF SB NINETY CLICK MENTHOL THE- CIGARS ARE NOT HURTING OR YOU. WE KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE AND SO DOES BIG TOBACCO WANTED PRAISE OUR KIDS WITH MENTHOL AND FLAVORED CIGARS. IT WOULD BE A FAILURE ON OUR PART WE COWER TO BIG TOBACCO WILL GUARD TO THESE DANGEROUS PRODUCT. MEANT THE ORIGINAL CANDY FLAVOR IS DRIVING TOBACCO CAUSED DEATHS IN DISEASE'S NATIONWIDE. THE COOL REFRESHING TASTE OF MEN ALL TOUTED BY BIG TOBACCO MARKETING MARKETING MAKES IT EASIER TO SMOKE AND GET ADDICTED. YOUTH SMOKERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE MENTHOL CIGARETTES THAN ANY OTHER AGE GROUP 57% OF HIGH SCHOOL SMOKERS USE MENTHOL CIGARETTES COMPARED TO LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF. HIS AGES EIGHT THIRTY FIVE AND OLDER. BECAUSE THE PREDATORY MARKETING TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY 85% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS AND 94% 94% OF LACKEY. WHO SMOKE USE MENTAL PRODUCTS. FORTY FIVE THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICANS DIE FROM A SMOKING CAUSED ILLNESS EACH YEAR. AND IT MADE A ONE POINT SIX MILLION AFRICAN AMERICANS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. WILL BECOME REGULAR SMOKERS AND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL DIE PREMATURELY A TO BACK REALLY THE- THAT MEANT CIGARETTES ARE ALL CHEAPER IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS CLEAR EVIDENCE. OF BIG TOBACCO'S HEARTLESS IN THIS. CIGARS ARE THE SECOND MOST POPULAR TOBACCO PRODUCT AMONG YOUTH SMOKERS. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF YOUTH CIGAR SMOKERS 72% REPORT USING A FLAVORED PRODUCT. SMALL PACK SIZES PRICES AS LOW AS NINETY NINE CENTS AND FLAVORS LIKE BANANAS MASHED TROPICAL ICE AND BOOZY WATERMELON MAKE CIGARS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO KIDS. IN THEIR OWN LOBBYING MATERIALS PREMIUM CIGAR MANUFACTURERS STATE THAT THEIR PRODUCTS DO NOT CONTAIN FLAVORINGS OR OTHER ADDITIVES THAT ARE FOUND IN OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS. IF THAT IS THE CASE PREMIUM CIGARS NOT BANNED BY SB SEVEN NINETY THREE. THE BILL BANS CHARACTERIZING FOR VERSION TOBACCO PRODUCTS. BUT ONLY THOSE THAT RESULT FROM THE ADDITION OF AN AGREED INGREDIENTS OTHER THAN TOBACCO. ANOTHER ARGUMENT OPPONENTS OF SB SEVEN NINETY THREE ARE MAKING IS THAT FLAVOR TOBACCO BANDS THAT INCLUDE MENTHOL CIGARETTES WILL ANALYZE TOBACCO POSSESSION AND GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AN EXCUSE TO HARASS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. COLLEAGUES THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. IF IT WERE MY NAME WOULD NOT BE ON THIS BILL. SB SEVEN NINETY THREE DOES NOT PENALIZE POSSESSION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND DOES NOT CREATE ANY CRIMINAL PENALTIES WHAT SO EVER. I WAS PROUD TO SUPPORT THE HISTORIC TOBACCO REFORMS WE ENACTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH REMOVE PENALTIES. FOR POSSESSION AND MADE OUR TOBACCO CONTROL LAWS MORE EQUITABLE. IN REALITY THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY KNOWING THIS IS A WEDGE ISSUE HAS URGED ME TO GET TOUGH ON KIDS WHO USED TOBACCO PRODUCTS BY REESTABLISHING WRECK CONEY PENALTIES. I'VE DRAWN A CLEAR LINE IN. IN FORCE SHOULD BE ON THE TO BACK. NOT THEIR VICTIMS OPPONENTS ARE ALSO USING THAT AT BEST INFLATED AND AT WORST MADE UP ECONOMIC ESTIMATES TO UNDERMINE SB SEVEN NINE THREE. THE TOBACCO IS PUT A PRICE ON OUR KIDS LIVES BUT I REFUSE TO DO SO. SB SEVEN NINETY THREE A PUBLIC HEALTH VICTORY FOR CALIFORNIA WE WILL PROTECT GROUP WE WILL PROTECT. AGAINST ANOTHER GENERATION GETTING ADDICTED TO THESE DEADLY PRODUCT WHICH IS PRICELESS ARE HARD FACTS. ABOUT BIG TOBACCO'S IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY AND ON PUBLIC HEALTH. THE ANNUAL CARE COSTS CAUSED BY SMOKING IN CALIFORNIA. IS THIRTY. I'M SORRY. NO UP HERE THE HARD FACTS ABOUT BIG TOBACCO'S IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY AND ON PUBLIC HEALTH THE ANNUAL HEALTH CARE COSTS CAUSED BY SMOKING IN CALIFORNIA ALONE IS THIRTY NINE POINT TWO NINE BILL DOLLAR. MEDI COSTS DUE TO SMOKING AMOUNT TO THREE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR LOST PRODUCTIVITY DUE TO SMOKING COST TEN POINT THREE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND HERE'S THE HUMAN TOLL CALL. OVER 25% OF CANCER DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SMOKING. FORTY THOUSAND ADULTS DIE EACH YEAR FROM THEIR OWN SMOKING IN OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND KIDS NOW UNDER EIGHTEEN. WILL DIE PREMATURELY FROM SMOKING. AND WHAT SCARES BIG TOBACCO THE MOST ABOUT SB SEVEN NINETY THREE THE ACT THAT RESTRICTING THE SALE OF MENTHOL AND CANDY FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS IS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO REVIEWS FROM OAK IN AND PROMOTE. SENSATION SB SEVEN NINETY THREE TAKE SWIFT ACTION TO PUT YOUTH AND POPULATIONS BY PROHIBITING THE RETAIL SALE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS. THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS A TARGET OUR AUDIENCE OVER COLLEAGUES START BEFORE THE AGE OF A TEAM. AND THE AVERAGE AGE A NEW SMOKER. IS THIRTEEN. ENTICING FLAVORS ENTICING FLAVORS COLORFUL PACKAGING AND NAMES AND LOGOS SIMILAR TO POPULAR TYPES OF CANDY HAVE BEEN USED SINCE I WAS A CHILD TO GET GET KIDS HOOKED BIG TOBACCO WEAPONIZED DECADES OF TREACHERY TO LURE A NEW GENERATION TO NICOTINE ADDICTION IT IS TIME WE BREAK THAT CYCLE. MEMBERS I KNOW IT IS EASY TO SAY THIS IS ABOUT BABY SO LET'S TACKLE PEIPING ONLY. OVER EIGHTY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE PASSED FLAVOR BANDS THAT GO BEYOND BAY BEING. AN EVERYDAY MORE CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE TAKING ON THE FIGHT AGAINST BIG TOBACCO. PASSING THE STATE BILL THAT IS BEEPING ONLY ORDER MAKES DANGEROUS EXEMPTIONS ACTUALLY DOES LESS TO PROTECT KIDS THAN THE STATUS QUO. DOING SO UNDERMINES THE HARD WORK OF OURCITIES AND COUNTIES EMPOWERS BIG TOBACCO TO UNDO STRONGER LOCAL PROTECTIONS CITING THE STATE'S ACTIONS. PUT DIFFERENTLY PASSING A BABY AN ONLY BILL. A PROTECT SOME KIDS IN THE SUBURBS BUT IS IT DOES NOTHING TO PROTECT KIDS IN THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT BIG TOBACCO HAS TARGETING FOR GENERATIONS. I SIMPLY WILL NOT SELL OUT ARE YOU. CALLING TO HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MISTER CHAIR. ONE DOCTOR PHILIP GARDNER CO CHAIR OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN TOBACCO CONTROL NETWORK.

I CAN'T SAY THAT THERE WILL BE A SITUATION WHERE PERHAPS ONE PERSON HAS A NEGATIVE ENCOUNTER WITH POLICE OVER A MYTH OUT THERE BUT I CAN SEE THAT HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIANS WILL DIE. BEEN GOING. ON CANCER HUNDREDS OF BLACK CALIFORNIANS WILL DIE. SOME WILL SAY THAT IT'S A BUDGETARY ISSUE PEOPLE JUST GOT AIRS ON OUR TO GAMING RESERVATIONS TO GET- MITTAL CIGARETTES AND THE STATE WILL LOSE OUT ON REVENUE. I'M SORRY I DON'T WANT THE STATE TO COLLECT BLOOD MONEY ON THE BACKS OF DEAD AFRICAN AMERICANS. ARE REJECT THAT OFFER THAT THAT THAT ARGUMENT. UP TO THAT THE CHOICE IS. THEY SHOULD LET BLACK PEOPLE CHOOSE TO SMOKE- METHYLATED CIGARETTES IF THEY WANT I WOULD JUST SAY. OPIOIDS ARE CHOICE ISSUE AS WELL BUT I WOULD BE THROWN OUT OF YOUR CHAMBER IF I SUGGESTED THAT WE ALLOW WHITE PEOPLE TO USE OPIOIDS BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR DRUG OF CHOICE.

EXEMPTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE SALE OF PREMIUM CIGARS SOLD IN CIGAR LOUNGES WHERE PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED AND CONSUMED IN THE ON THE PREMISES. AND ANSWER SECTION SIX THE SUBDIVISION SHALL NOT APPLY TO LOOSE LEAF TOBACCO ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS SENATOR HILL. MISTER CHAIR I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT IT WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF THE INTENT AND WE JUST SAW THESE AND JUST HEARD THEM TO HAVE- CONVERSATIONS IN THE DRAFTING OF THOSE IMAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- INTENT IS CLEAR IN IT WITHOUT THAT OPPORTUNITY I ACCEPT THE. AMEND EXCEPT THE MOMENT THAT IMPORTANT ARE ALL RIGHT ENOUGH OKAY RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU AT THIS POINT WE WILL ASK MEMBERS COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS OF THE. THANK YOU CHAIR I JUST US YOU KNOW I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A ISSUE THAT'S BEEN EXTREMELY. ENGAGING FOR OUR STATE AND I KNOW FOR THE LETTER AS WELL. AND I WONDER IF THE OVER THE LAST DAY. THIS IS-BEEN AN ISSUE THAT- IT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD. I'M A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND WHEN E. CIGARETTES AND VAPING FIRST CAME OUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAD- NO IDEA WHAT TO DO- WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW. WHAT CATEGORY I'M FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. I HAD TO. FOR A WITH LEGAL COUNSEL TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS COVERED UNDER TOBACCO OR NOT. I'M IN SO I THINK WE'VE HAD TEN YEARS OF LOT OF. X. IN OUR STATE IN AROUND COUNTRY. WHY FLEET BATTLE IS. PART TO ARE STILL. AND WHY IT'S BECAUSE A GATEWAY SO. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR HAS- BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. I KNOW THAT THIS IS BEEN DIFFICULT IT'S BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING BUT I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS AROUND. THIS AND THE CONNECTION TO- TOBACCO USE AMONGST MY PEERS- ARE VERY REAL AND IN SO MANY LOCAL COMMUNITIES- IT'S BEEN WELL OVER A DECADE. THAT WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS. I THINK WITH. IT THERE'S NO TO THE REST. BLOOMS ARE BIG ISSUE AND YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE ELEMENTS THAT- DON'T HELP RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF THEM SO YOU KNOW I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL. I DO APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT AROUND THE STATE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS. WHAT I'VE BEEN IN. POLICYMAKERS AT THE LOCAL CHANNEL AND STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TACKLE THIS- AND I THINK WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE IMPACT IT HAS ON MINORS AND HOW THAT SERVES. AS A GATEWAY FOR PROLONGED USE- AND ALSO HEALTH IMPACTS THAT ARE VERY ILL IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBER LIMON I CAN'T HONESTLY CAN'T REMEMBER WHO WAS NEXT SO. I HAD MR RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CENTER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION FOR IT AS WE TALK ABOUT THESE VAPING PRODUCTS AND I THINK THE FLAVORS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE REALLY ATTRACTIVE TO THE CHILDREN ARE YOU TO THE STATE- ARE LOOKING AT THIS BILL IN ENCINO THERE WERE SOME OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT YOUR ONE INDEX TO TAKE. OUR UNFORTUNATE WE DON'T HAVE THEM A LOT SOONER RATHER THAN- I WAS ELEVEN HOURS SO TO SPEAK THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. KIND OF A BETTER. WHAT THESE A MEMBER MEAN AND HOW IT. IN REALITY TO THE BILL I'M GLAD YOU ARE WORKING ON SOME OF THESE AND LOOKING TO ACCEPT. AS AS- BEING PRESENTED- BUT STILL HAVING SOME ISSUES TO GRASS AROUND IT- I'M TORN ABOUT THIS BILL IT'S IMPORTANT BILL IT'S- SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY. A NEEDED AND TO ADDRESS BUT- I JUST HAVE TO COMMENTS I WANTED TO MAKE ABOUT THIS BILL. ONE IS. THE LAST. THAT'S BEING TAUGHT ABOUT AND STAFF ANALYSIS OF ABOUT TWO HUNDED MILLION DOLLARS- WHAT DO WE LOOK TO DO. BECAUSE OF THAT LOST REVENUE TO OUR BUDGET- WILL LOOK AT A STATE BUDGET OF OVER FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUE OR OR AND- AND- DILEMMA THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE- HOW TO SELECT OR OR CURRENT BUDGET FOR THE NEXT YEAR. MOVING FORWARD AND- FUNDING SOME OF THESE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE BENEFITTED FROM. OUR FROM- THE SALE SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS. ARE THE SECOND ONE UPS YOU KNOW AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BILL. IS ENFORCEMENT OF IT WHO DO WE LOOK TO. ENFORCE THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT BEING SO. COMMUNITIES WILL LOOK AT THAT ISN'T I'M IS BUT- FIRST RIGHT THEY'RE NOT YOU WITH. COVERT PARTNERS. THE IS. LIMITED SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD LOOK TO ENFORCE IT- JUST OPPOSED TO COMMENTS AND- I'M LEANING. MAYBE SUPPORT THIS BILL IF I DO WOULD BE AS OCCURRED VOTE BECAUSE OF ARE WHATS BUT- MYSELF AROUND THE- A MAN. THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED. I WOULD RESERVE MY- SUPPORT. TO I NEVER FOR SO IF YOU CAN JUST KIND OF PIGGYBACK ON THE TWO THE PURCHASE THANK REMEMBER IN IN REALLY THE COST THE OR THE LOS INCOME AS WANT TO SAY I HIS BE OVER SHADOWED BY WHAT IS THE REALITY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HEALTHCARE COSTS THAT CALIFORNIA WILL SAVE AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING STATEMENT SAID YOU KNOW THERE ARE THE BIG SPECIALLY LIKE THE MEDIC CAL COST THE SAVINGS OF THREE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR- WITH THIS LEGISLATIONWITH THIS BILL PASSED WITH A BE A TREMENDOUS SAVINGS OF HEALTH COSTS THIS IS THE- BILLION IN. NORMAL HEALTH CARE CURRENT J. TWO WHICH SHOULD REDUCE HEALTH OF UP THAT MOST OF US PAY FOR OUR HEALTH INSURANCE IT IN TOTAL THIS WILL GREAT SAVINGS IT WILL BE A REVENUE LOSS AND FRANKLY TO LOOK AS THE AS AN AUSTIN PRICING PLACE ON IPHONE WILDER KIT BURKE T. YOUR. BROUGHT OVER TO T. INTO IN THE VEHICLE SAVINGS. THANK YOU BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE NEXT A MEMBER JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING IS MY ERROR I APOLOGIZE IT'S A LONG TEST OF ALREADY WE STILL HAVE MANY BILLS AHEAD OF US SO- I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THERE WERE ACTUALLY THERE ACTUALLY THREE PIECES OF THE AMENDMENT. NUMBER ONE A. B. WE'RE WE'RE ASKING FOR WE'RE EXEMPTING ESSENTIALLY A PREMIUM CIGAR WE'RE DEFINING THAT AS ANY CIGAR THERE'S NOT MASS PRODUCED BY USE OF MECHANIZATION AS A RAPPER IT IS MADE ENTIRELY FROM WHOLE TOBACCO AND AS A WHOLESALE PRICE OF NO LESS THAN TWELVE DOLLARS. THAT IS IN THE SUBDIVISION SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE SALE OF PREMIUM CIGARS HOLDEN. AND LOUNGES WHERE PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED AND CONSUMED ON THE PREMISES. AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE OF THIS IS IT SHALL NOT APPLY TO LOOSELY TOBACCO. WHICH IS MEANT. TO GO TO ENCOMPASS PIPES. AND ALSO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE USING THIS FOR A CEREMONIES IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN CEREMONY SO. THAT IS NOT WAS NOT AS BAD AS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THESE THESE ARE ARE PRESENTED SO I APOLOGIZE THAT I DIDN'T MAKE THAT CLEAR I DO HAVE A COPY OF IT THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND THAT SO THANK YOU. SO I'M TRYING TO THINK WHO IS I THINK MISTER RAMOS WAS NEXT. THEN MR MCCARTY AND MISS MISS BURKE. WE'RE OF GOING AROUND HERE NOT NOT IGNORING YOU MISTER FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- FIRST OPPORTUNITY AND THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS MUCH. NEEDED BAIL- THERE IS AREAS- THAT I STILL HAVE CONCERNS AND THAT'S THE FUNDING MECHANISM OF IT- CERTAINLY BROUGHT UP THE GOOD WORK THAT FIRST FIVE HAS DONE TO EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY. ON THE PROBLEMS WITH TOBACCO BUT YET WE DON'T HAVE THAT REVENUE STREAM FOR EDUCATION ON THE VAPING PRODUCTS OF IT AND WE'VE TALKED AHMET LAYING ON THAT COMPONENT OF IT. SO I WANTED TO- AS THIS DIALOGUE CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF DISCUSSION ON THE FUNDING STREAM FOR THE VAPING PRODUCTS SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THE FUNDING. INTO THE LOCAL LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO EDUCATE A LOT OF THE- COMMUNITIES- THAT NEED THAT EDUCATION ON THE VAPING PRODUCT ITSELF. WE'VE TALKED AT LENGTH AGAIN ON WHAT WE START AT THE VAPING I AGREE THERE NEEDS TO BE. SOME TYPE OF BANNING ON THOSE PER BUT ALSO THEIR- COMPONENT TO FALL SAME REVENUE MACINNES. FIRST FIVE WE'VE TALKED AT LENGTH ON THAT AND ALSO. TALKING ABOUT TOBACCO IN THE ILL THAT ARE THERE NOW THAT WE'RE INTO THAT BUT WE ALSO TO SEE. THAT CREATION AMERICANA WAS A- SO THINK THAT ABLE TO FORWARD THINK THROUGH THESE TOPICS THAT WE WOULD BE HIT WITH THAT EDUCATIONAL PROCESS ON THAT ASPECT ALSO. AND I GET TO- WHERE MY COLLEAGUES. MONNING BROUGHT UP AS FAR AS THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM CERTAINLY ONE OF. I THINK WHOSE HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR. IS IT LOCAL LAUNCH. WE ASKED TO BRING THAT FOR AND I'VE I BRING THAT UP NOT SOME. TO JUST MORE TO TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT THE PROBABILITY OF WHO'S IN FORTUNATE BECAUSE WE SEEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE- WITH ILLEGAL MARIJUANA AND DISPENSARIES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO CLOSE THOSE DOWN TO GET THE REVENUE INTO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SO THESE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE VERY REAL- AND THESE ARE IS STILL. ARE VERY- CONCERNING TO ME SPELL WHEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT VAPING AND THEN WE GOING TO- THE TOBACCO IN SOME OF THESE OTHER AREAS BUT YET WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT. WHERE THAT ENFORCEMENT'S GONNA COME FROM THESE ARE THINGS THAT I WANT TO BRING UP AND MAKE SURE THAT THE WERE ON RECORD TALKING ABOUT THESE REASONS IN THE FUNDING STREAM THAT I BELIEVE SHOULD BE PART OF A DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD SHOULD THIS BILL CONTINUE TO BE DEBATED- AND THESE ISSUES ALONG THE WAY THANK. YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR. MISTER MISS BURKE I THINK OR I THINK AND THEN A STRICT MCCARTY. PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD MR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BEING SO GRACIOUS WHEN WE SPOKE- ABOUT THIS BILL WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS AGREED BUT I BELIEVE WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A VERY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP AND I HAVE A TON OF RESPECT. FOR THE SENATOR AND HIS WORK CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK UP JUST A YEAH FOR THE SENATOR AND HIS WORK- SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE BEFORE I SAY WHEN I'M GETTING READY TO SAY. THAT THAT IS CLEAR THANK YOU HOWEVER. THERE'S A HOWEVER- YOU KNOW I THINK MOST OF US AGREE HERE THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE KIDS SMOKING IN FACT IF I HAD IT MY WAY NO ONE WITH SMOKE. I'M NOT A FAN AT ALL. THAT SAID DECIDING HOW TO VOTE TODAY HAS BEEN REAL A REAL CHALLENGE FOR ME. AND I WANT TO BE SUPER CLEAR ABOUT THE CRUX OF MY ANNOYANCE IS THAT THE BILL IS INDICATIVE OF A TREND THAT I FIND BELITTLING AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE WHITE OR GOLD OF INCLUSIVITY EMPOWERMENT AND ENRICHMENT THAT OUR STATE CONTINUALLY PREACHES. SMOKING ADDICTION MUCH LIKE ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY IS USUALLY A SYMPTOM OF A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM. THESE PRODUCTS TO BECOME VICE IS USED TO ESCAPE REALITY. TAKE A DRIVE THROUGH AND THEIR PORTION OF MY DISTRICT AND YOU WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND A LIQUOR STORE. DRIVE THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU'LL BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND A GROCERY STORE OR A HOSPITAL YES. THERE IS A LIQUOR STORE CONVENIENCE STORE ON EVERY CORNER. AND PEOPLE WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT COMMUNITIES BEING TARGETED. OVER AND OVER IN THE BILLS WE PASS I SEE SYMPTOMS OF OUR STATE PROBLEMS BEING ADDRESSED AND WEEK CASUALLY GLOSS OVER THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THOSE PROBLEMS AND THIS BILL IS NO DIFFERENT. ACCORDING TO THE CDC ADULTS BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL OR MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO SMOKE AS ADULTS WHO ARE ABOVE THE POVERTY LEVEL AN ANNUAL INCOME. THAT GAP JUMPS THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY WHEN WE COMPARE ADULTS WITH LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION TO ADULTS CO GRAD. IT'S NOT COINCIDENTAL WE KNOW THERE IS A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN POVERTY AND THINGS LIKE SMOKING AND DRINKING THAT HELP PEOPLE AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT HELP PEOPLECOPE WITH THE STRESS AND TRAUMA OF PROPERTY. SINCE THIS BILL. FIX THIS BILL IS MADE OVER TO THIS HOUSE I'VE DEALT WITH. MORE CALLS MORE MEETINGS MORE TAX SOMETIMES AROUND THE CLOCK NOT TO MENTION SOCIAL MEDIA TRYING TO PUSH ME IN MY OPINION IN ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER AND IT THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. WHERE IS THIS FURY ON ACTIVITIES AROUND BILLS THAT TACKLE REAL POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS ISSUES. OR TO PROTECT KIDS ARE WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING THE LIBERTIES OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. I'M NOT SURE I SEE HOPE YOU'RE- I SEE FOLKS BANG ON A DRUM THAT CLAIM TO PROTECT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE BUT ONCE AGAIN CRIMINALIZING THEIR CHOICES WHEN WE SHOULD BE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES AND SERVE AND INCENTIVIZING BETTER CHOICES. EVEN MORE CONFUSING IS THAT WHILE WE SIT HERE AND LAUNCH THAT ANY TOBACCO USE IS HARMFUL THIS BILL CONTAINS A CARVE OUT FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF PRODUCT. FOR NO SCIENTIFIC BASED REASON. THE PROPONENTS SAY THAT YOU WOULD THAT YOU WANT TO HELP MINORITIES FROM DETRIMENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS THAT ARISE FROM TOBACCO USE ONLY THEN TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE THAT APPLIES ONE GROUP OF MINORITIES IS MORE RESPONSIBLE. THAN ANY OTHER TO INDULGE IN THOSE PRODUCTS. MY STRUGGLE LEADING UP TO THIS HEARING HAS BEEN BASED IN THESE KIND OF FRUSTRATIONS. AND I CERTAINLY HOPE. THAT MOVING FORWARD THAT I CAN SEE THE SAME ENTHUSIASM AND COMMITMENT TO LIFTING BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE UP NOT JUST TREATING US OUT WHENEVER YOU OR WHATEVER OF THOSE SEE IF IT. HOWEVER I DECIDED TO VOTE TODAY I HAVE TO BE HONEST IT'S NOT A WIN FOR ME. I WILL BE DISAPPOINTED AND WHATEVER I END UP VOTING TODAY. BUT I THINK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK SENATOR I THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK MISTER CHAIR AND TO ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO SPENT. COUNTLESS TIMES ASKING ME ABOUT THIS ISSUE I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR SUPPORT AND CONVERSATION AS WELL. THANK YOU MISS BURKE MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- THANK SENATOR HILL FOR PUSHING THIS FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS THIS IS. AN ISSUE THAT IS BEING HER UP IN DOWN OR- THERE ARE A HUNDRED JURISDICTIONS I BELIEVE THAT HAVE TAKEN SOME SORT OF POLICY AT THE- LOCAL- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON FLAVORED TOBACCO INDOOR ENERVATING AND- THE TIME IS RIGHT THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE EPIDEMIC. THERE A COUNTRY BEFORE KOPET NINETEEN HIT THIS WAS THE PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC AND THE ISSUE OF THE DAY ON THE NEW YORK TIMES DAILY AND FRONT LINE AS FAR AS WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. IN URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS IN MIDDLE AMERICA IN SCHOOLS UP AND DOWN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE BATHROOM UP. THE BATHROOMS ARE LOCAL MIDDLE SCHOOL HERE AT CAL MIDDLE SCHOOL ON SATURDAY THE LOCAL PARENTS WERE TELLING THEIR THEIR THE JUL ROOMS WHERE KIDS WERE GOING AND ON THEIR BREAKS HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY ENGAGE OF FLAVORED TOBACCO. I SAW APPARENTLY TIME AND THEY HAD THIS LITTLE HOODIE AND A LITTLE STRING ON THE HOODIE WAS A FLAVORED- FLAVORED TOBACCO THAT DEVICE AND THERE ARE IN THE CLASSROOM AND SO- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THESE THINGS CAN'T BE NON FLAVORED AND THAT'S A REALITY BUT LET'S FACE IT. THE HOOK. ARE YOU. FOR FLAVORS THAT ARE JUST ROMANTICIZING WHAT'S COOL I I'LL NEVER FORGET. LAST YEAR I TOOK OUR LITTLE GIRLS TO SELL GIRL SCOUTS APPEAR AT SAFEWAY THEY'RE TEN YEARS OLD. AND WEBER MY LITTLE DAUGHTER VICTORIA SAID DADDY. THAT CIGARETTE SMELL SO GOOD WHAT WAS IT. SOMEONE WALKED OUT WITH VAPING SECOND SMELLED SO GOOD CIVIC CENTER MANON SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS THEY TASTED GOOD IT SMELLS SO GOOD IT TENURE. AND I HOPE TO GOD MY KIDS NEVER GET ADDICTED TO. TOBACCO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE COMPANIES HAVE ONE MISSION TO MAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THEIR COMPANIES AND THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND THEY HAVE ONE. BY PRODUCT AND THAT'S KILLING PEOPLE. THERE'S NO GOOD THAT COMES OUT OF THIS PRODUCT. THAT HEALTH COSTS ARE TREMENDOUS AND WE'LL GET TO THAT THE SECOND ONE FOR ON THAT. LIKE THIS AND THAT COMPLICATED THIS IS BIPARTISAN IN THE SENATE THE SAME BUILD A STRONGER BILL AT OR REPUBLICAN SENATORS VOTE FOR THE- SO I HOPE THAT THIS. HOUSE ST IS NOT THAT COME. AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME THE ONES YOU CARE ABOUT THIS. ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH MATTERS CERTAINLY THERE ARE A FEW BUSINESSES THAT ARE GOING TO LOSE. MONEY AND PROFITS FOR THIS BUT WERE MORE ABOUT SAVING LIVES IN CALIFORNIA HELPING A FEW BUSINESSES THRIVE SELLING TOBACCO PRODUCTS THE BILL. THIS ISSUE TOO IS I THINK VERY IMPORTANT DURING COPA NINETEEN. BECAUSE FACE IT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE FACING PROBLEMS FROM. FROM VAPING HAVE HAVE. IMPACTED I MEAN SYSTEMS AND THERE'S THE REST OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE I WOULD SAY THERE'S A PROBABLY A BIG CONNECTION WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE- VAPING ADDICTION AND THAT- FRANKLY HAVE SUCCESS OF IT HAVE HAVE. HER CAR MORE LIKELY TO DO. OKAY CAN MORE LIKELY TO BE AT RISK BURKE OF THE NINETEEN. I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE FINANCES FOR THIS AND- LET'S FACE IT WE ARE THE HEALTH COMMITTEE WE'RE NOT THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHEN AT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ARE HAVE TWO DAYS TO LOOK AT THE HELP THAT. THE LABOR TOBACCO HURTS. THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS AND OUR KIDS I THINK THAT THE LAND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S TRUE I SAID THIS WHEN MY COLLEAGUES LAST NIGHT I DON'T WANT TO FLIPPANTLY JUST DISMISS. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THAT'S MONEY BUT A TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MOST OF THE TOBACCO TAX MONEY IS ONE TIME RIGHT. THE INCOMING MONEY TO FIRST FIVE BODIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THESE FIRST FIVE BODIES WHO SUPPORT THIS BILL HAVE SAID THEY WILL GLADLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS TOMORROW. THEY USE THEIR MIND. AND FOR THESE pTHINGS LIKE EARLY EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE FOCUSING ON KIDS ZERO TWO FIVE THEY KNOW IT'S A DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE. THEY DON'T USE ANY OTHER MONEY TO FUND ON GOING THINKS THERE'S NOT MONEY TO FUND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM NOT MONEY FOR KATE NOT MONEY FOR EARLY AT. BECAUSE IT'S ALL. ONE TIME AND IS THE- GRANTED LAST YEAR. WE HAVE A NOW ATTACKS ON THE FOR. THAT HAS IT AS GET SO THIS IS A GREAT TO DO THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TO BE A LOSS OR SOMETHING ISN'T REAL. I WILL TWO OF THE FULL EFFECT YET SO AS FAR AS THE IMPACT FOR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR OUR- IT'S MINIMAL. SENATOR DOLE SAID THE SAVINGS ARE TEN TWENTY TIME GREATER IS AS WHAT YOU WITH WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY THESE TREMENDOUS COST TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND MEDIC COW- SO THIS IS THIS IS RIGHT FOR SO MANY REASONS I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THAT THE OF THE OTHER PERSON BUT THIS IS A LIBERTY OF LEGISLATIVE BODY AND I FULLY RESPECT OUR OUR CHAIR AND OUR- SENATOR- YOU KNOW WORKING ON THIS SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THE NIGHT HAD THE SAME DAY LAST YEAR THIS YEAR WE DECIDED TO GO WITH ONE DEAL WITH WITH THE BILL HERE BEFORE CITY ITSELF CERTAINLY PROUD TO BE A JOY AUTHORS AND I WANT ADDRESS WHOLE. THEY SAY THE VISION I THINK IT'S A IT'S A YOU TO SAVE THEY WERE GONNA BE ARRESTING. FOR USING THIS PRODUCT FOR SMOKING A MENTHOL CIGARETTES WERE SAYING THAT NO LONGER COULD PEOPLE SELL THE PRODUCT. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ARRESTING PEOPLE FOR POSSESSION. WE'RE NOT GOING TO MEET THE INCREASING PENALTIES FOR ANY OF THAT. BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG IN OUR SYSTEM WOULD HAVE IF YOU HAVE A LIQUOR STORE AND YOU CAN LEGALLY SELL BOOZE TO A MINOR. YOU GET POPPED ONCE OR TWICE YOU LOSE YOUR LIQUOR LICENSE AND AS A SEVERE CONSEQUENCES BUT IF YOU'RE A- CONVENIENCE STORE. AND YOU HAVE MULTIPLE OF SELLINGTO MINORS THERE'S NOT THAT CONSEQUENCES THAT NOW THEY'RE BUILT ANOTHER DAY I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GO AND ADDRESS THAT I THINK WE DID HAVE SOME PARITY ON THAT. THERE IS NO DISINCENTIVE FOR INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR- BUT IN SOME THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR US TO DO THIS IN CALIFORNIA- AGAIN WHERE THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. AND I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A OF A MOST AND- ON THIS BILL MISTER JACK. THANK MCCARTY. THAT'S CORRECT. PERMISSION TO READ. COURSE THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO READ A LITTLE BIT ON THE FISCAL IMPACT FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT STATE THAT THE ESTIMATED TAX REVENUE LOSS OF THIS BILLIS A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION THIS FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTY FIVE MILLION FROM CIGARETTES TO MILLION FROM TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION FOR NEXT YEAR'S FISCAL YEAR. THE FIRST ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR THAT THE BAND WILL BE IN EFFECT IN ADDITION THE SOCI TAX SALES LOST THIS OF ANY SIX POINT MILLION TWELVE MILLION TO THE RURAL FIVE FIFTY AT THE- SOMEONE SO. ALL OF THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST. I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS BEEN MOVED- AND BROUGHT TO THIS HOUSE FOR US TO VOTE ON- IN AND IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYONE IN THIS FLOOR RIGHT NOW OR IN BOTH HOUSES. THAT AGREE WITH THE CRISIS ON YOUTH KEEPING EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE THAT MOVE FORWARD I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO ANYONE MEMBER. IN EITHER HOUSE AND IN EITHER PARTY OR ONE PARTY. THAT DISAGREES WITH. I BUT THIS IDEA THAT ONLY BECAUSE THIS IS A- POLICY COMMITTEE. DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT WE WILL NOT THINK ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE. UNORTHODOX AND A LITTLE- NARROW MINDED NEXT YEAR. WE WILL BE FACED WITH AN MASSIVE REVENUE LOSS WE WILL BE ASKED TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THINGS TO CUT. I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE EXPRESSED THOSE CONCERNS ARE ALREADY THINKING ABOUT THAT. SO NEXT YEAR WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BUDGET. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THINK OKAY DO WE CUT FUNDS FROM CHILD CARE. DO WE CUT FUNDS FROM TEACHERS NURSES I JUST THAT'S PROGRAM WHICH HELPS SENIORS AND THOSE ITH DISABILITIES. THOSE ARE REAL CUTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION MAY SEEM LIKE A DROP IN THE BUCKET IN A BUDGET THAT'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT FOR NONPROFITS AND FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. AND SO I FIND MYSELF IN A VERY STRANGE SITUATION OF HAVING TO BRING CERTAIN THINGS UP AND HAVE BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS AND I JUST WANNA MAKE IT. CLEAR TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR HOUSE AND THE OTHER HOUSE- TO THE ADVOCATES TO THE LOBBYIST. ALL OF US THAT ARE SITTING IN THESE CHAIRS RIGHT NOW IN THIS AMAZING INCREDIBLE SPACE. HAVE A RIGHT A DUTY AND OBLIGATION. AND QUITE FRANKLY A PRIVILEGE. TO BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS. SO WHEN YOUR RESPONSE ME WHEN I AM ASKING THE QUESTION IS WHY AREN'T YOU AUTOMATICALLY WITH US. I HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT. BECAUSE IT IS MY JOB TO ASK QUESTIONS IT IS MY JOB TO UNDERSTAND IT IS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MOVING POLICY. THAT MAKES SENSE. SO I'M GLAD AND GRATEFUL FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAVE HAD THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING BILL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR THE- ISSUES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN A- I THINK THE VAPING ISSUE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ADDRESS WE HAD A BILL. IN THIS HOUSE. THAT WAS REFERRED TO A DIFFERENT COMMITTEE THAT WAS REFERRED- I'M SORRY THAT DID NOT GET REFERRED. ON THE SENATE SIDE- THAT ACTUALLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT FROM A MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE. AND I'VE HAD TO EXPLAIN TO SOME FOLKS. SOME TERMINOLOGY THAT IS USED ON THE STREET IN TERMS OF WHAT IS A BLUNT. I HAVE TO I HAVE A COUPLE OF MEMBERS AND- THEY DIDN'T KNOW. SO WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND IT'S A LITTLE FUNNY MAYBE BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW I THINK IT YOUR WHATEVER THAT IS USED BY YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS THAT HAVE CLEARED OUT AND THEN YOU PUT A CANNABIS AND IT. OR WE'D IN IT RIGHT. THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY SMOKING A CIGARETTE THE OTHER SMOKING A BLUNT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE WAY THAT SOCIETY WORKS. AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE PASSING LEGISLATION. ON TOBACCO- AND NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT IS THAT PEOPLE USE IT. IS JUST MIND BOGGLING TO ME BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE BEYOND. THIS CAPITOL THIS BUILDING. THAT ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING TO US THINKING WHAT ARE YOU DOING. BUT THERE IS A BIGGER THERE IS A BIGGER GOAL- I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED WE HAVEN'T INCLUDED FLAVORED CANNABIS IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING. THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USING BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VAPING AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TOBACCO NOW I HOPE THE MOMENTUM. FOR FEVER CANNABIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE THAT IS ALSO AN ISSUE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR BATHROOMS AT HIGH SCHOOLS THAT I HAVE HEARD DIRECTLY. FROM YOUNG STUDENTS IN MY COMMUNITY AND MY DISTRICT ON THE OVER. A CELL IS ILLEGAL CANNABIS DISPENSARY IS THAT JUST POP IN IN AND OUT. AND SO IF THE ISSUE REALLY IS TO ADDRESS. TEEN VAPING AND TEEN CONSUMPTION THEN I HOPE THAT THAT'S A CONVERSATION AND THE POLITICAL COURAGE THAT WE CAN ALSO INCLUDE ONE LOOK AT. LEGISLATION IN THE FUTURE SO AGAIN THANK YOU- TO THE CHAIR INTO THE AUTHOR FOR THE CONVERSATION- I DO BELIEVE THAT- THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- BUT I JUST AGAIN WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT IT IS OUR JOB AND OUR OBLIGATION OR DUTY TO ASK QUESTIONS. AND THINK ABOUT THE HOLISTIC WAY IN WHICH WE DO POLICY AND A HOLISTIC WAY IN WHICH WE LOOK AT HOW THE BUDGET IS IMPACTED AND WILL BE IMPACTING THE COMMUNITY MOVING FORWARD NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- CENTER THANK YOU- WAS GREAT TALKING TO YOU EARLIER TODAY- A LOT OF WHAT I SAID HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED AND I DO WANT TO REITERATE A COUPLE THINGS THOUGH BECAUSE I DO FIND IT FASCINATING. THAT WE ARE THE FATHER OF TWO KIDS- WE ARE TASKED TO PROTECT OUR KIDS AND- LIKE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SADDAM SACRAMENTO HERE. WHEN YOU GO INTO A STORE AND YOU SMELL WAIT. I ACTUALLY CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT'S NICOTINE OR TOBACCO INDOOR CANNABIS I CAN'T. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT PROTECTING YOUTH FROM VAPING. I DO FIND IT FASCINATING THAT WE HAVE NOT BROUGHT IN CANNABIS INTO THIS DISCUSSION. YOU GO INTO A DISPENSARY IT'S IKE **** WONKA'S CHOCOLATE FACTORY. THEY GOT FLAVORS ALL OVER THE PLACE STOP THE DON'T EVEN SOUND GOOD TO ADULTS. BUT NONE THE LESS THEY'RE SELLING AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME. MARKETED TO ADULTS. NOT HAPPENING BUT SOMEHOW. WE'VE ALLOWED THE CAMERAS INDUSTRY JUST TO GO OFF AND DO THEIR THING AND I'M NOT EXACTLY POSE BUT I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT AE SMOKING CANNABIS OR CBD SIDE OF THINGS. AS PRIMARILY THE THC SIDE CANNABIS IS WHAT THEY'RE WORKING FOR. SAID I WASN'T VERY VERY CONCERNING TO ME AS WELL AS THE HOOKAH ASPECT OF THIS WE EXEMPTED HOOKAH IN THE ORIGINAL BILL. WHAT I FIND INTERESTING BECAUSE RIGHT BEHIND BEING HOOKAH IS THE NUMBER TO. HAS A NUMBER TO A NUMBER OF YOU DOING IT. NOT TO MENTION THAT THE RUNNING AROUND WITH ESSENTIALLY A BALL WITH TUBES OUT OF IT FEDERAL SUCKING ON AN X. SPECIALLY IN THE BEEN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WE'RE JUST SIX. EXPECTING THEM TO SAY THAT DOES EVERYTHING. GOING TO HAPPEN. I AM VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC LOSS OF TAX REVENUE LOST TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARDS BEEN SAID A COUPLE TIMES WITH. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WE HAVE JUST THROWN OUT THE DOOR IF THIS THING PASSES AND RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE THAT IS DESPERATELY. TRYING TO FIND A REVENUE STREAM. WE'RE GOING TO WHACK. AND ALLOW TO GO TO MEDICAL AND GUESS WHOSE DISTRICT HAS A LOT OF MEDICARE. RECIPIENTS OF MINE AND I KNOW A LOT OF YOURS DO AS WELL SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA GO I THOUGHT REAL HARD LAST YEAR TO KEEP IT IT SERVICES IN AMERICA. MAYBE THAT'S GONE SO THE DIABETIC PATIENTS SUFFER SO WE'RE PICKING THESE WINNERS AND WE'RE PICKING THESE LOSERS. AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND THAT IS WHY I DO WANT TO PRESENT A SET OF AMENDMENTS I KNOW THERE WAS A MOTION MADE. SO I WANT TO MAKE SUBSTITUTE MOTION. FOR A SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT TAKE THIS BILL. FROM A TOBACCO BAN FLAVORED TOBACCO BAN INTO A 1100% FLAVORED VAPE BAN AND EXCLUSIVELY JOB TITLE STARTED HAS PROBABLY THE MOMENT I WOULD ASK PASSED THOSE OUT NOW I MEAN WE CAN.

SO THE ORIGINAL MOTION IS BEFORE US. ELEVEN ICE FOR KNOWS MOTION BY MISS LIMóN PASSES AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TABLED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE- JUST STATEMENT THE CALLER OF COURSE. AND I WOULD LIKE US IN THE RIGHT I KNOW HE'S ON THE PHONE AND HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET IN A COUPLE TIMES BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION SO IF WE COULD- BRING HIM ON THE LINE. BUT THERE IS A- YOUNG MAN- I KNOW ONCE AGAIN THE CINEMA FROM SACRAMENTO MAY COMMENT THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW OF ANY. YOU KNOW BODY THAT'S BEEN ARRESTED BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL. CIGARETTE SALES AND GUIDING THEIR GARDENING OR- WE SAID POSSESSION. THIS IS WHAT I'M I'M WORRIED ABOUT. LIKE THESE FOLKS. WHEREVER THEY ARE. IF THEY WANT TO BUY THIS IF THEY HAVE AN A PROBLEM. THEY'RE GOING TO GET THIS PRODUCT. WE KNOW THIS WE DO ACROSS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS SO I'M WORRIED ABOUT THIS WE'RE GOING TO CREATE. ANALYST AT MARKET WITH THE SODA HUGE HUGE CONCERN THAT I HAVE I'M NOT GOING TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY FROM SOMEBODY OUTSIDE THIS IS THE ARCHITECT OPTED FOR MEMBERS TO DELIBERATE MISTER RIGHT. COULD HAVE BEEN A WITNESS HE COULD HAVE BEEN A WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THIS HE WAS HE WAS NOT. HE HE DID HE DID OFFERING ME TO- THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE S. FOR THE MEMBERS TO DELIBERATE- LOOK THIS BILL AND I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. THIS BILL DOES NOT CRIMINALIZE THIS WE HAD A BILL BEFORE US LAST YEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE. THAT DID PRIOR TO MY AMENDMENTS THAT PULLED ALL THE CRIMINALIZATION ITEMS OUT OF THAT. WE HAD A MEMBER WHO WANTED TO CRIMINALIZE. THIS ISSUE AND I PULL THAT OUT. THIS BILL DOES NOT CRIMINALIZE THIS ISSUE. IT DOES NOT DO THAT AND I THINK IT'S A RED HERRING AND I AND TO IMPLY THAT IT DOES IS NOT NOT CORRECT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR IT DOESN'T BUT IT DOES YEP MAGIC MIGHT CREATE A BLACK MARKET WE DON'T KNOW IS THAT A POSSIBILITY. WE DON'T KNOW. THIS STILL SOMEONE COULD STILL BUY THESE PRODUCTS ONLINE. IF THEY HAVE TO DO IT AND THEY COULD STILL BUY IT ONLINE THIS DOES NOT RESTRICT THAT. BUT IT DOES. PREVENT THE ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE. OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SPONTANEOUSLY FIND A WAY TO GET A PRODUCT IN A CONVENIENCE STORE. THAT'S THE GOAL HERE AND SO I THOUGHT I'D AND THAT IS MY DEPARTMENT THAT'S MY BUT I. YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW NO AND I EVERY DRIVERS STRUCTURE OPINION ON. THIS AND I DO WORRY THOUGH BECAUSE IF WE STILL CAN BUY ONLINE AS WELL AS CASINOS I THINK IS IN THE BILL AS WELL CORRECT. WE DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY OVER SOVEREIGN NATIONS SO. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING UP TO WHEREVER OR BUYING ONLINE. CARTONS AT A TIME. AND SELL THEM ON STREET CORNERS LIKE THAT IS A CONCERN BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES DO ALL THE STUFF. SO THERE IS A CONCERN TO THIS- AND I WILL I'VE BEEN TALKING TO LONG. TIME JUST FINE AND YOU KNOW I THINK YOU ALSO KNOW- MR FOR THAT THE WORK WE DO HERE IS NEVER CARVED IN STONE. AND IF THERE AREN'T UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I FULLY HOPE THAT THIS BODY. SENATE WILL BENEFIT THE CONSEQUENCES- BUT AT THIS POINT I WOULD HAVE TO STATE IT'S SOMEWHAT HYPOTHETICAL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A OF THAT DONE EVERYTHING. SUCH THAT MINIMIZE MY SUB THANK A TEACHER THANK REST FOR ME AFTER MAYES I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE KIND OF AWKWARD SITTING AT THERE ARE GOING TO TALK TO THE SENATOR. OKAY THE NORTH WORSHIP BAND. THE BILL FOR OF THEM. AIMS OFTENTIMES IN COMMITTEE WHERE WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A REAL DEBATE AND REAL CONVERSATION THAT IT'S ALL. DONE BEFOREHAND AND WITH THAT THE PANDEMIC AND THE WAY THAT WE HAD TO OPERATE- I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ALLOWING THIS A SORT OF. OF CONVERSATION- I'VE GOT AN AWFUL LOT TO SAY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE OVER THE LAST WEEK TWO WEEKS I'VE HAD A LOT OF. A CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AND THIS IS A- AN ISSUE FOR ME THAT I TEND TO- HAVE CONFLICT BETWEEN HEAD AND HEART. ON IT- BECAUSE- FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW I WANT TO ADVANCE LIBERTY I WANT PEOPLE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES- I DON'T LIKE A TOBACCO I KNOW THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF. OF DAMAGE. AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE DOCTORS THERE'S HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND NO. THE CHAIR- HAS SEEN THIS FIRST HAND AS A- AS A DENTIST WHERE HE'S SEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD CHIU OR WHATEVER ELSE THAT HAS HAD INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF IMPACT AND ORAL CANCER- THAT'S THAT'S COME FROM THAT WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU YOU SEE THAT FIRST HAND. ARE YOU BEGIN TO A HAS AN IMPACT HAS IMPACT ON YOUR PSYCHE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON WHAT YOU. ON ON WHEN YOU BECOME ABOUT A MEMBER ELECTED OFFICIAL MAKES YOU WANT TO GO HAVE A HAVE SOME CHANGE. BUT THE ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAID I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU THE SENATOR IS. THE ONE THING I HAVEN'T ENJOYED OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH- MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS IS THE- ME SOME OF THE- HOMINEM ATTACK THAT HAVE BEEN- BEEN. LAW STAFF AT ONE AND OTHER I'M THINKING THAT WAY PARTICULAR CHAIR. IS DOING IT. HE'S. TO TECH CANNABIS OR- OTHER PARTICULAR CHAIR BE. HE'S TO HAVE BACK OF BIG TOBACCO OR- THIS NUMBER DOESN'T LIE THIS BE. OF ONE OR THIS MA'AM DOESN'T LIKE THIS BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER REASON. WHAT I FOUND IN MY COMPENSATION- WITH ALL OF YOU. THERE'S A SENSE. CONCERT ABOUT THIS AND YET THE SAME TIME I THINK YOU'RE STRUCK LIKE I AM A BETWEEN. THE IN. ALL THIS BECAUSE THE BILL AS IT'S- A WE'VE SEEN. I DON'T KNOW LOVE BUT I DO KNOW THAT WHEN I GONE. BACK TO MY DISTRICT AND I'VE GUY INTO TOUR OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS WHEN I'VE SPOKEN TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND YOU TALK TO THEIR STUDENT RUN. TO NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT I'VE SEEN IN EVERY HIGH SCHOOL TO BRING UP. THE FACT OF VAPING. AND THERE'S A QUESTION I HAVE IS LIKE WAIT A MINUTE ISN'T ILLEGAL ALREADY FOR YOU KIDS TO BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE. A VAPING ISN'T ALREADY- DON'T YOU HAVE TO BE TWENTY ONE TO BE ABLE TO. TO BUY THAT AND YET KIDS ARE GETTING IT- DONE. AND OF COURSE WE ALSO KNOW. WE ALSO KNOW THAT. THE FLAVORS ARE APPEALING TO THE THESE KEY AND HAVE MADE IT. MADE IT COOL SO I ALL OF THAT KEY. ARE GETTING IT AND IT IS A AT A CRISIS STAGE AND AS AS ELECTED OFFICIALS AS POLICYMAKERS. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING OF IT. AT THE SAME TIME A CONCERN FOR ME AND I'VE MADE- THIS OF THIS ARGUMENT IN REGARDS TO YOU KNOW THE SEVENTY FIVE OR EIGHT YEAR OLD FORMER NAVY VET. THAT ARE. CAN PI AND HIS FAVORITE. I'M HIS FAVORITE TOBACCO OF ANY SAYS BLACK CHERRY. I FOR ME REALLY GOING TO TAKE AWAY THAT BLACK CHERRY TO. FROM THE FORMER NAY VETS SMOKING FOR THE LAST FORTY THAT DOESN'T MEAN. TO ME. NIGHT THAT HE WON BY EVEN IF THE THIS BILL PASSES SINGLE BY THAT LINE A RIGHT CAN DO THAT. YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO THE STORE FOR THREE YEARS AND- IN ESSENCE A WE WOULD BE. THAT AWAY WHICH I LEADS ME TO WHAT I'VE BEEN TALK MORE THAN I. TO DO SO PLEASE ME FORGIVE ME. I'D LIKE TO. SET UP. FROM SEPT TO BROUGHT THIS TO SOME OF ISSUES WHY IT. WE AND YOU RAISE THE ISSUE OF HOW CAN SOMEONE SINCE PURCHASE IF YOU'RE A MINOR A PRODUCT THAT YOU CAN'T BUY IT FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD. BUT THE RECENT SURVEYS THAT WERE DONE SHOWED THAT 74% OR 71% OF THOSE. WHO PURCHASED JUHL PODS AND JUUL PRODUCTS WERE UNDER THAT. 71% WERE ABLE TO BUY IN A STORE WHERE IT WAS. ILLEGAL TO PURCHASE THOSE PRODUCTS. AND WHEN HAVE STING OPERATIONS BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY FIND IT 50% IS WHAT THE- BY RATE HAS BEEN WITH THOSE MINERS SO WHATEVER WE'RE DOING IS NOT WORKING. SO THE IDEA OF TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO STOP. BIG TOBACCO FROM INCENTIVIZING AND ADDICTING CHILDREN WHICH HAS THE HIGHEST RATE IN NATURAL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CANNABIS AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. BUT THE RATE OF CANNABIS ADDICTION IS ABOUT NINE POINT ONE PERCENT. ALCOHOL IS ABOUT FIFTEEN POINT 4% OF USE. TOBACCO THIRTY ONE POINT WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE IN THE BEGINNING AGE OF A SMOKER IS THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE. I TOOK MY FIRST. I THINK DRAGONESS AT WHATEVER COLLEGE RECORD I THINK I WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN. TASTED SO BAD I WOULD NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN. BUT IF IT HAD THE COOLNESS OF PEOPLE. OR THAT MEANT WHICH IS WHAT THE FOR WITH THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE ATTRACTING THEM THAT'S WHAT'S GETTING THEM ENGAGE THAT'S WHAT'S GETTING THEM. ADDICTED AND AT THIRTEEN TWENTY ONE YOU NEVER SEE ANYONE I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY YEARS A EVADE WAKES UP IN THE MORNING SAYS. I THINK I'M GONNA START SMOKING TODAY. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. SO THEY GET THEM WHEN THEY'RE ON. A TRACK THEM WITH THE FLAVORS. AND THEN THERE HOPE FOR LIFE AND THEN THE KILL AT SOME POINT ALONG THE WAY. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS BILL THAT WE ATTRACTED WE GET THE FLAVORS. AND THAT WE GET THEM YOUNG. AND THAT WE DO IT NOW WITH TOBACCO AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT CANNABIS AND THE OTHER THING I'M OVERWHELMED FRANKLY WITH WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY I MET MY CLOSEST PAGES OF TRYING TO ARGUE THE POINT AND BRING IT HOME I DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. I MEAN THIS IS I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THE CONVERSATION. SO GRATEFUL FOR THE HEARTFELT FEELINGS. THAT I'VE HEARD TODAY. AND THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE FUTURE WITH THIS ON THE REVENUE. FOR CANNABIS. FOR THE ISSUES OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT THE NUANCES THAT ARE DEVELOPED IM SORRY I WON'T BE HERE TO HELP YOU WITH IT. SO SANTA CAN I TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME LANGUAGE- ABOUT SOME BUS.OTHER EXEMPTIONS- THAT HAVE BEEN. BROUGHT BEFORE US- I JUST BEFORE THE MEETING I TRIED. TO CALL THIS A LITTLE BIT ACCEDED TO THE- A THIRD OF SEPTEMBER. BROUGHT UP I REALIZE THAT I. BIGGEST ON A TO BACK AND TOBACCO RELATED ITEMS WHEN SHE REFERRED TO YOU- THE BLUNT THAT WAS ME. I DIDN'T I DIDN'T KNOW THAT- SO I I'M NOT A STREET SMART AS I THOUGHT THAT THAT THAT I WAS- I GUESS I DON'T REALLY THINK I WAS THAT SMART ABOUT. STUFF ABOUT BEING STREET SMART. BUT SO WE THE ONE WE'VE GOT THE HOOKAH EXAM SHIFT AND I SHARED WITH YOU ON THE PHONE TODAY- MY EXPERIENCE AND HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE HOOKAH AND THE CULTURE OF SURROUNDING HOOKAH- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE DON'T NEED TO GO INTO THAT. BUT NOW WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER EXEMPTIONS. BEFORE I. WENT TO REGARD THE PREMIUM CIGARS WHICH WE THINK REALLY ONLY. ARE USING PREMIUM CIGARS. WE'VE ALSO GOT AN EXEMPTION FOR A PIPE THE- LOOSE LEAF PIPE TO BE AT IT'S IS IT'S CRAFTED. SO THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS WE'VE EXEMPTED HOOKAH. WE'VE EXEMPTED PIPE THAT TOBACCO. AND WE'VE ALSO- BOTH AND PREMIUM CIGARS FROM THIS BAND. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE EXEMPTED THAT. WE KNOW ABOUT THAT MAKE. MORE RIGHT. THE GOALIE. IS THE WITH KIDS RIGHT WE WANT TO STOP KIDS FROM GETTING HOOKED ON THIS. BUT THERE ARE PRODUCTS TOBACCO PRODUCTS THAT ADULTS USE ARE THERE UP PRODUCT WE SHOULD ALL PUT IN. TO MAKE THIS BILL A BETTER BILL I'M NOT AWARE. IN THE ISSUE AT THE EXIT. AND WHAT WHAT CONVERT THAT. I'VE HAD WITH SOME OF THE MEN. THIS COMMITTEE AND WHERE THE- SHINJI AVAILABLE WE DO HEARD ABOUT TODAY YOU HAVE TO WAIT RISKS WHAT IS THE OF YOUTH GETTING THAT PRODUCT AND BECOMING ADDICTED TO IT AND THEN HOOK A VERY LIMITED IN LOW RISK. S. PREMIUM CIGARS OVER TWELVE DOLLARS VERY LOW RISK. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IDEA PACKAGE FOR- TOBACCO GROUND TOBACCO OR RELIEF TOBACCO. IT FOR PIPES ANOTHER VERY LOW RISK AND IT WILL BE CRAFTED I BELIEVE IN A WAY THAT WILL NOT INSTANCE. INCENTIVIZE THE USE IN OTHER TYPES OR FORMS OF- OF PRODUCTS SO I LOOK AT THE RISK FACTOR IN THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME AND WAS CERTAINLY THE AMENDMENTS WERE MY CHOICE. OF I HEARD ABOUT THAT ABOUT THEM TODAY I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT THOSE BECAUSE I THINK AS WE KNOW POLITICS IN THIS BUILDING THIS CALL. IN HIS TO ACCEPT. THE LOOSE LEAF ON THE DEAF AND TALKING HYPED AS LOOSE LEAF A INCLUDE A LOOSE LEAF CHU POINT THAT U. S. W. W. WOULD YOU WRITE DOWN ON THE TOBACCO OVER ON THAT YOU WOULD SUCK ON THE BALCONY OF THE JUICES UNDERMINES IN IT DOES NOT. I WOULD HAVE. TALK TO THE CHAIR ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER EXEMPTIONS AT ALL FOR ANY CESSATION BISA THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS. THAT ARE GETTING PEOPLE OFF OF ACCO OTHER ANY OTHER FLAVOR THAT MIGHT AND DIVIDE THEY KEEP THEIR SOME NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF IN THE FACT THIS IS A DEVICE IF YOU WANT TO BE. AS A IN. IN CALL YOUR THIS IS IT DEVICE THAT DRUG HAS APPROACH THAT YOU GO THROUGH TO BE FOR THAT AND NONE OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE'VE SEEN TALKED ABOUT OR USED BY YOUTH TODAY OR CLAIM TO BE CESSATION DEVICES ARE ACTUALLY. LEGITIMATE LICENSED CESSATION DEVICES OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR THAT TEACHER THANK YOU. OH I'M SORRY I'M SORRY MISTER NAZARIAN APOLOGIZED. ON I'M SORRY I JUST WANT TO STAND UP AND STRETCH MY LEGS A LITTLE BIT BEFORE I NO GO AHEAD MISS AGUIAR-CURRY AND THEN MISTER NAZARIAN TURN TO MAKE IT A QUICK IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY SENATOR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWAR- YOU KNOW IN A PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD HAVE HAD THIS VETTED WITHOUT MULTIPLE MEETINGS. AND HERE WE ARE AND WE ALL ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE PARTICULARLY FOR KIDS IN VAPING. AND WE ARE IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. AND SO I JUST THAT THEN I'VE TOLD SO MANY FOR PEOPLE TO COME INTO MY OFFICE A CALL MAY BE EITHER SIDE IS THAT GOSH IF IT WAS MY WAY. REGIS TO VAPING AND FLAVORED THE- OF VAPING IN JEWEL AND JUST KEEP IT SUPER SIMPLE SO WE CAN ADDRESS THESE KIDS. BECAUSE NOW WE'VE MUDDIED THE WATER AND THERE'S A LOT OF. CONVERSATION IS STILL NEEDS TO BE TAKEN PLACE I THINK I MEAN I THINK THAT- MISTER FLORA AND OTHERS OF. THIS HEART GOES OUT AND I THINK THERE'S PART THAT I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. AND EVERYONE'S OPINIONS IMPORTANT. AND THIS IS TEARING ME APART BECAUSE I SEE THE IMPORTANCE AND MY CONCERNS I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN I HAVE CHILDREN I'VE GOT MY NIECES AND NEPHEWS TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON THE FAVORITE. AT A BREAK MY HEART AND- THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THE SCHOOL DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND SO- YOU KNOW I'M REALLY CONFLICTED. A REALLY CONFLICTED AND I WAS VERY CLEAR WITH YOU ON THIS BEFORE- I'M GONNA BE HONEST I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOU TODAY BUT I NEED YOU TO KEEP KEEP WORKING ON THEM. AND I'M AND I SIT RIGHT. AND I MAY NOT. A SUPPORT YOU WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR BUT IT'S NEEDS MORE WORK- IT'S- THE WATER THAT MUDDIED ON THIS. I FAMILIES WERE IS JUST CAN BE ONE. OF OKAY AND NOW IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE CAN FIGURE SO I JUST WANNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS AWFUL. BERMAN YOU HAVE A WORK TO THIS FOR A LONG. ALSO SOME MEMBER WORKED ON THIS A LONG TIME AND THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. AND IT'S SO HARD TO DO SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU. AND ALL THE COMMENTS TODAY I'M- I REALIZE THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND REALLY CARE ABOUT OUR YOUTH. AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE IT RIGHT AND- I'M HOPING WE CAN DO THAT AND I'M HOPING WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT TO SEND TO THE GOVERNOR. WHEN THIS IS ALL SAID AND DONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANKS TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS. IMPORTANT BILL FORD. FOLKS I'LL BE VERY CANDID WITH YOU I'M NOT SO CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS AT ALL. I THINK THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO DO. I THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ARE EXTREMELY VALID. BUT MAYBE MY PERSPECTIVE IS VERY DIFFERENT. I GREW WHEN MY FAMILY WAS SEPARATED DURING THE WAR IN IRAN AND WE HAD TO MY MOTHER AND I WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO COME HERE. AT THE AGE OF EIGHT I SAW MY MOTHER STRUGGLING WITH THE LEVEL OF STRESS. HAVING TWO CHILDREN HERE ONE CHILD IN A THIRD COUNTRY AND HER HUSBAND IN YET A THIRD COUNTRY. WE WERE SEPARATE INTO THREE CONTINENTS AND THAT STRESS OF NOT KNOWING WHERE THINGS WERE GONNA GO WHILE SHE WAS WORKING THREE JOBS. SHE STARTED SMOKING. SHE WOULD FINISH A PACK A DAY. THAT I WOULD FIND THE PACKS AND THROWN AWAY. AT EIGHT. I'M GLAD I DIDN'T GET HOOKED ON IT. BECAUSE I'VE SEEN WHAT IT DOES TO FEEL WE ALL HAVE FRIENDS WHO HAVE WITNESSED WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM. SO I CAN'T SHARE THAT I'M I DON'T SAY IT LIGHTLY BUT I CAN'T SHARE THAT I'M CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS. ANYTHING I WAS HAVING TOUGH TIME. BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE GAMES MANSHIP THAT'S BEEN GOING ON BETWEEN OUR TWO HOUSES. THAT'S BEEN EMBARRASSING THIS PANDEMIC. WHEN WE SHOULD BE ADVANCING STRAW BILL THAT HOW THE LEGISLATURE IS WORKING ON BEHALF OF ITS CONSTITUENTS. IT WHICH EACH OTHER'S BILLS. AND IT'S NOT EVEN PARTISAN BY THE WAY. IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF IT WAS REPUBLICAN ON DEMOCRATS IT'S DEMOCRATS DOING IT TO EACH OTHER. MORE TO COME ON THAT LATER BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM SOME AUTHORS. ON THIS BILL THOUGH. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME VALID POINTS BROUGHT UP ABOUT HOW THIS IMPACTS CB. AND SOME OTHER SOME OTHER AREAS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON. BUT I'M GOING TO BE PROUD TO JOIN YOU IN SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY I DO HAVE HOPE YOU GET THE TO PASS IT. I DO HOPE THAT ALSO YOU WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUE FROM- THE ASSEMBLY WHO ALSO HAD A SIMILAR BILL. AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SOME OF HIS CONCERNS- AND I DO ASK THAT YOU. IF YOU WOULD HONOR ME WITH- ADDING YOU ADDING ME AS A CO AUTHOR YOUR BILL IS WELL. BUT HAVE A- COST ISSUE THAT I'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL. I APPRECIATE YOU RAISING. THE AWARENESS ON THE NUMBERS WE DO SEE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THOSE ARE NUMBERS WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR RIGHT. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE COSTS. THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW. WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE ACCOUNTING FOR THERE'S NO NUMBERS IT'S IMMEASURABLE HOW EXPENSIVE IT'S GOING TO BE. WHEN FUTURE GENERATIONS OF KIDS. OF MOST OF THOSE KIDS ALREADY DEPENDENT ON STATE ON MEDIC CAL RELATED- OF STATE. FUNDED COSTS AND FEDERAL FUNDED BECAUSE PROGRAMS. HOW MUCH OF A COST THEY'RE GONNA BE CONTRIBUTING BY NOT BYE BYE ENDING UP IN HOSPITALS. SO IT'S LET'S ALSO LOOK AT THE FUTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A FEW REMARKS I JUST WANT TO FIRST START BY SAYING SENATOR. SHARE YOUR PERSISTENCE- YOUR PRESENTATION- I KNOW THIS IS BENEFITS AN ISSUE OF IMPORTANCE TO YOU FOR MANY YEARS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT ALSO FOR THE OTHER- CO AUTHORS IN THE ROOM I APPRECIATE YOUR CAMPING THIS ISSUE- THROUGH ITS IT'S DIFFERENT HURDLES ALONG THE WAY I JUST WANT TO THANK THE- BODY FOR ITS IT'S CONVERSATION THAT THE IDEAS BEING PUT ON THE TABLE QUESTIONS THE CONCERNS OF THOUGHT THAT WHAT A BODY LIKE THIS. IT TO DELIVER ABOUT REYES ISSUES AND RAISE QUESTIONS LIKE THE LAST SPEAKER- SEE THIS AS A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD ISSUE I'M NOT CONFLICTED ABOUT IT I THINK IT IT COMES WITH THE SIMPLE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE FACING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS FOR OUR CHILDREN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT I TO MAKE IT BETTER TO. I IMPROVE HEALTH AND THIS IS WHAT SHOULD BE DOING I THREE KIDS I TALKED TO ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS ABOUT- THE FLAVORED TOBACCO ISSUE AND I SAID TO HER. WHY DO. YOUNG PEOPLE TO SMOKE WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE ATTRACTION. AND SHE SAID PEOPLE LIKE MENGONI LIKE MEANT. AND I SAID WHAT ABOUT NON FLAVORED TOBACCO SHE SAID THAT SHE THINKS THERE THAT'S GROSS AND YOUNG KIDS ARE NOT ATTRACTED TO THAT SO SOME IS. SO THAT YOUNG KIDS ARE GETTING ACCESS. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE UNDER AGE AND THE TRACTION IS CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE DATA THERE IS IT OUT IT'S THE FLAVORED AT TOBACCO SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING- I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THIS BODY DO AS IT IS A HEALTH COMMITTEE STEPPING UP AND PUBLIC HEALTH. OF OUR COMMUNITY. WALDRON I DO WANT TO% A POINT ABOUT THE BUDGET ISSUE N. AND THAT THE DEPLETING FIND A COMING FROM OUR ARE TOBACCO TAXES ARE THAT WOULD RESULT THAT'S BEING PROTECTED I DO THINK THAT WE CAN'T ALWAYS HAVE PARA ONE HATTON ONE SET OF. UPLOADERS AND NOT LOOK AT THE- THE BUDGET ISSUES ESPECIALLY IN A TIME OF SO SENSITIVE ABOUT THE BUDGET BUT I BUT I WILL SAY THIS THAT THAT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE WHEN IT COMES TO SIN TAXES WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE TO PACO. THEY PUT AN END TO TERROR DEBATE HERE ALSO THAT OVER TIME THEY WILL TO AND WHEN THEY ARE DEPLOYED THAT A GOOD SIGN IN THIS THAT IT MEANS PUBLIC HEALTH IMPROVED. LAST OR SMALL IN COMING DOT AND THAT'S GOOD FOR OUR HEALTH ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AS THE SECOND CENTER SAID AT THEM MULTIPLE SAVINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE OFF AND OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT WE WILL BE REALIZING SO APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I APPRECIATE YOU CAMPING THIS OP PROP TO THINK I. ON A PHONE RIGHT FOR THE BUT I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THE VOTING CAN APPRECIATE YOU CENTER HAVE. THANK YOU I KNOW. THE HOUR IS GETTING LATE WE HAVE A LOT WORK AHEAD OF US AND I'LL DO MY BEST TO BE BRIEF BUT I DO HAVE SOME POINTS I WANT TO MAKE. YOU KNOW THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. SAYS THE TOBACCO KILLS MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR. EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE. IT'S THE MOST DEADLY. CONSUMER PRODUCT EVER MADE. PERIOD THE CDC SAYS THE TOBACCO COMPANIES TO FIND ON THE WEBSITE ADD MENTHOL TO MAKE CIGARETTES SEEM LESS HARSH AND MORE APPEALING TO NEW SPOKES MOTORS IN YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT'S THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE HERE IS TRYING TO NOT HAVE THE NEXT GENERATION HOOKED ON A DEADLY PRODUCT. SO I LOOK AT THIS IN MY MIND AS AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE AND WHEN YOU DO PREVENTION IT'S AN INVESTMENT. TO REAP THE FUTURE REWARD AND THEIR FUTURE AWARD IS A REDUCTION IN THE THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WE SPEND. ON MEDIC CAL ON SMOKING RELATED ILLNESSES. THINK ABOUT THAT SO YES WE WILL HAVE A SHORTFALL HERE. BUT IS IT BETTER TO ALLOW AN INDUSTRY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR. SOME SLACK SO THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR MORE IN IN REVENUE OKAY. IS THAT THE TRADE OFF HERE. BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN FIND A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS QUITE FRANKLY IF THAT'S WHAT IT TRULY WORKS OUT TO BE. SO THIS ISSUE IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME. MY ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL CAREER. HAS BEEN ABOUT TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE STOP SMOKING. I WATCHED MY GRANDMOTHER IN A NURSING HOME. WITH CRIPPLING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. SMOKING METHYLATED CIGARETTES WHEN SHE COULD BARELY LIKE THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS SO CRIPPLED UP. HE DIED. OF CANCER I WATCHED MY GRANDFATHER ROLLING HIS OWN CIGARETTES AND BEING FASCINATED BY IT. TO WATCH HIM DIE OF A HEART ATTACK. IT'S DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ME. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE I SAW ON MY PRACTICE COME IN WIDTHS GOAL OR COPENHAGEN. TUCKED BETWEEN THEIR CHEEK AND THEY'RE LEFT. YOUNG KIDS BASEBALL PLAYERS HOOKED IN WHEN THEY WANTED TO QUIT THE COULD. I THINK OF THE TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD BASEBALL COACH IN CINEMA COUNTY. WHO DIED OF ORAL CANCER FROM THAT KIND OF PRODUCT. THE LEFT BEHIND A YOUNG CHILD. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT HERE SO FOR ME THE CHOICE IS VERY CLEAR. IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT VAPING WHY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE CAN DEBATE STATISTICS ALL DAY LONG AND YOU KNOW I THINK- MISTER FLORES SAID THAT HOOKAH IS LIKE THE NUMBER TO CONSUME PRODUCTS OUT THERE BUT YOU JUST WANT TO BAN VAPING. THAT'S A BIG WIN FOR TOBACCO COMPANIES. BECAUSE I THINK A LOT. OF THEM ARE BEGINNING TO WRITE THIS OFF ANYWAY. BECAUSE OF JULIAN SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES OUT THERE BUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO PROTECT IS THIS. THEY WANT TO PROTECT PRODUCTS LIKE THIS. TWO PACK SWISHER SWEETS CHOCOLATE FLAVORED DOLLAR FORTY NINE. TWO PAC EACH A DOLLAR FORTY NINE. TWO PAC MAN ANNA SMASH A DOLLAR FORTY NINE. TWO PACK TROPICAL FLUSH A DOLLAR FORTY NINE I CAN GO ON BECAUSE YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY OTHERS INCLUDING BOOZY WATERMELON BOOTIES HOUSE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT HERE BECAUSE IF WE JUST BAN VAPING. THE KIDS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT IT'S A HUGE WIN FOR THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HUGE. SO I HATED HAVING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE AMENDMENT SENATOR. BUT YOU KNOW THE PROCESS AS WELL AS I DO THE GOAL IS TO MOVE SOMETHING GOOD. AND SOMETIMES THE PERFECT DOESN'T HAPPEN IT RARELY HAPPENS IN THIS HOUSE IF I HAD MY WAY WE'D BE ON SQUARE ONE WHERE YOUR BILL WAS STARTED. THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY AMENDMENTS. WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE LIVES HERE FOLKS THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS IT'S BEEN MY ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIFE. WHEN I WAS THE MAYOR OF MY OWN CITY BEFORE I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE WE RAISE THE AGE THAT YOU COULD BUY TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO TWENTY ONE. THE FIRST CITY IN THE STATE TO DO THAT. AND WE A REWARD FOR THAT WAS THREATENED LAWSUITS BECAUSE- IT VIOLATED THE STEAK ACT WE COULDN'T DO IT. WE COULDN'T DO IT. SO WHEN I CAME HERE I WAS FORTUNATE UP TO SENT TO PARTNER WITH CENTER PAN DURING THE SPECIAL SESSION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE GOT THAT PASSED AND THAT'S SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY TWENTY PLUS OTHER STATES OF DOING THAT NOW. WE WERE THE FIRST I WANT TO CALIFORNIA TO BE THE FIRST. WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN. TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOT BE HOOKED ON THESE PRODUCTS. PEOPLE START SMOKING MOSTLY 90% M. START BEFORE THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. THAT'S WHY THESE PRODUCTS EXIST TOBACCO COMPANIES WANT KIDS TO USE THESE PRODUCTS BEFORE THEY'RE TWENTY ONE AND SO TO GET THEM OUT OF STORES.

S. S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FIVE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN BY THE AUTHOR. SO WITHOUT WE WILL MOVE ON TO- S. B. NINE SEVENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR MONNING SENATOR MONEY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY I APPRECIATE THE ENGAGE THAT I'VE WITH MANY OF YOU AND WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR- EXCEPT THE CHAIRS SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK LARA PLANNING CHRISTINE MOBLEY FOR ALL YOU'VE YOUR HARD WORK THE STAFF WHO HAVE WORKED ON THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT PATIENTS CONSUMERS AND COMMUNITIES. OUR CONSTITUENTS. FOR TOO LONG STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION RESULTS IN INCREASED PREMIUMS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR AS REPORTED BY THE LA TIMES AND IS PRESENTED IN ACADEMIC JOURNALS. EXISTING LAW PROVIDES LITTLE OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION AND MARKET PRACTICES LEFT UNCHECKED HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND UTILIZE ABUSIVE MARKET PRACTICES THAT DRIVE UP PRICES AND REDUCE ACCESS FOR CONSUMER. IN NINE SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE LARGE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AS WELL AS PRIVATE EQUITY GROUPS AND HEDGE FUNDS TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE AN ACQUISITION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL WITH ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE FACILITY OR PROVIDER. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD EVALUATE THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION BASED ON TWO FACTORS FIRST WHETHER THE TRANSACTION WOULD INCREASE OR MAINTAIN CARE COORDINATION AND OR INCREASE OR MAINTAIN AFFORDABILITY OF CARE TO AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION. AND SECOND WHETHER THE TRANSACTION SUBSTANTIALLY LIKELY TO RESULT IN ANTI COMPETITIVE EFFECTS THAT OUTWEIGH ANY BENEFITS. IF THE ACQUISITION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL DOES NOT MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY DENY THE TRANSACTION OR PROPOSED TERMS OF CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE THE BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY. SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN DOES NOT OUTRIGHT DENY ANY TRANSACTION IT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS OUR CONSTITUENTS THIS BILL ENSURES THAT OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM GROWS IT MUST INCREASE OR MAINTAIN IT SERVICES NOT JUST ITS PROFITS. ADDITIONALLY SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN ESTABLISHES THE HEALTH POLICY ADVISORY BOARD THE BOARD WOULD BE MADE UP OF A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF STAKEHOLDERS AND WOULD ADVISE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I'M PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS. FINALLY SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN WOULD DECLARE THAT HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THAT EXERCISE SUBSTANTIAL MARKET POWER MAY NOT ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT LIKELIHOOD OF ANTI COMPETITIVE IMPACTS. ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIORS ARE DEFINED TO IN MARKET. DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF COMPETITION DIMINISHING QUALITY REDUCING CHOICE INCREASING THE TOTAL COST OF CARE OR DIMINISHING ACCESS TO OR AVAILABILITY OF HOSPITAL OR NON HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE CHAIRS AMENDMENTS THAT I'VE AGREED TO DO THE FOLLOWING. THEY ADD A FIVE YEAR SUNSET TO THE PROVISION OF THIS BILL RELATING TO THE AG'S AUTHORITY TO REVIEW TRANSACTIONS. THEY RAISE THE THRESHOLD FOR EXPEDITED REVIEW TO A TRANSACTIONAL VALUE OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS. OR HIGHER. THEY ADD COUNTY FACILITIES TO THE LIST OF EXPEDITED REVIEW ENTITIES YOU SO MUCH OKAY. THEY CHANGED THE AG A THORNY TONIGHT CONSENT FROM SHALL TO MAY. IN THE EXPAND THE CRITERIA FOR APPROVING A CHANGE OF CONTROL TO INCLUDE MAINTAINING SERVICES. AS THE WORLD RESPONSE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS MEMBERS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE IS MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER AT THE SAME TIME COBIT NINETEEN HAS CREATED AN ENORMOUS FINANCIAL STRAIN ON BOTH HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS MAKING THESE PROVIDERS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONSOLIDATION ATTEMPTS BY LARGE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS AND HEDGE FUNDS. HAS COVERED NINETEEN IS FORCING CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN INSURERS RESPONSIBLE OVERSIGHT OF THE GROWTH OF LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE HEALTH CARE MARKET. WITH THE LEADER OF THE CHAIR I DON'T LIKE TO PRESENT MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL JENNY PHILLIPS SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND EMILIO BERNINI DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ANTI TRUST SECTION WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. I WILL RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MINING- WOULD LIKE TO GO TO THE PHONE AND- TAKE OUR WITNESSES- FIRST OUR FIRST WITNESS WILL BE JENNY PHILLIPS SO. AS WE CAN HAVE A LONG TIME I THINK THERE MIGHT STILL BE A MODERATOR THERE I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING FOR AWHILE BUT- HELLO. AN AIRLINE OF JAPANESE ARMY. MISTER CHAIR CAN HEAR ME I'M SORRY. THE CHECK OUT YES PLEASE HI JENNY PLEASE GO AHEAD WE CAN THAT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH READING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN BUILT ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING PATIENTS BY EXPANDING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S AUTHORITY OVER HEALTHCARE TRANSACTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT OF ANTITRUST LAW. EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY REQUIRES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO REVIEW AND CONSENT FOR ANY SALE OR TRANSFER OF THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY OWNED OR OPERATED BY A NONPROFIT CORPORATION. SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN BUILT ON THE SIGNAL LAW BY REQUIRING HEALTH CARE. PRIVATE EQUITY AND HEDGE FUNDS ALL THIRTEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL APPROVAL BEFORE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE CHANGE OF CONTROL WHAT HAPPENED ANOTHER PROVIDER INCLUDING BOTH. FOR PROFIT AND NONPROFIT PROVIDERS. THIS REVIEW IF INTENDED TO AND- THESE COUPLE TWENTY CONSIDERING IMPACT OF. REQUIRING A- THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WILL BENEFIT PATIENTS IN THE FORM OF INCREASE CLINICAL INTEGRATION. ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY TO SERVICE IT IT'S PRETTY WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE ANTI COMPETITIVE THE FACT OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS NOT OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS TO CONFIRM. UNDER S. NINE SEVEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE COULD NOT REVIEW EVERY PROPOSED PROVIDER TRANSACTION INSTEAD THE REVIEW IF LIMITED TO ONLY BILL TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. PRIVATE EQUITY GROUP OR HAD FIVE. WHEN THEY ARE ACQUIRING OR MAKING A CHANGE OF CONTROL FOR PROVIDER SERVICES OR FACILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE NINE SEVEN SEVEN DOES NOT COVER EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS OR LEASE AGREEMENT UNLESS AT. LEAST IS ACTUALLY THE EQUIVALENT OF A SALE. BUT ABU PROFIT NINE THAT SEVEN IT'S UNLIMITED SPECIFIC TIME FOR AND CONSISTS OF A FIFTY DAY AND MITCHELL WILL BE A PERIOD. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REQUIRES MORE INFORMATION OR DETERMINES THE PUBLIC MEETINGS APPROPRIATE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY EXTEND THE REVIEW PROCESS. ONLY AT SPECIFIED IN THE BILL THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES AN EXPEDITED REVIEW PROCESS. FOR SPECIFIED PROVIDERS. SB NINE SEVEN ON THE- BUILT ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL EXISTING AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE ANTITRUST LAW BY SPECIFICALLY TARGETING ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR BY LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT USED THEIR MARKET POWER TO DRIVE UP PRICES. UNDER THE BELT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM USING THEIR MARKET POWER TO INCREASE PRICES WOULD NO LONGER BE PERMITTED TO USE HARMFUL PRACTICES SUCH AS TING AN EXCLUSIVE DEALING CONTRACT. ANOTHER KEY ASPECT OF SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN IF THAT WOULD PROVIDE THEATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD ADVANCE NOTICE ABOUT A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM REQUIRES A NEW PROVIDER. EXISTING ANTITRUST. BLOOD DOES NOT ONLY PROVIDE THE H. GENERAL WITH THE NOTE THAT. HAVING THE ABILITY FOR THE TELL CARE SAID TRANSACTION OF THEY ARE FINALIZED WILL HELP ABOUT PRICE INCREASE. AND PROTECT. PATIENTS TWENTY GENERAL IF PROUD. ENOUGH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL AND HAVE TO TAKE A QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS EMILIO THERE.

TO ON THE PHONE ALEX HAWTHORNE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN AMY DURBAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SO. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY- PLEASE WITH THEM IN. MADAM MODERATOR. EVENING MISTER CHAIR TALUKS CAN WE LIVE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD EVENING OUR TOP PART OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. OCCIPITAL AND A BROAD COALITION OF OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR ONE FUNDAMENTAL REASON. IT WILL CREATE A BERRIER HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR ACCESS TO CARE ACCESS TO SCARCE MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND ACCESSIBLE STAFF. THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TODAY ALREADY HAS SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT AND THE SPECS. AS PART OF THE EXTENT THE POWERS VESTED IN THAT OFFICE. IN ADDITION TO ENFORCING EXISTING ROBUST ANTI TRUST LAWS THE OFFICE ALSO HAS COMPLETE DISCRETION TO REVIEW THE SALE OF NOT FOR PROFIT HOSPITALS WHICH ARE THE MAJORITY OF HOSPITALS IN THE STATE. THE LAWS AND POWERS ARE USED EVERY YEAR AS RECENT LAWSUITS AT HOSPITAL SALES AND ATTACHED. ADULT FOCUSED SERIOUS FAULT BECAUSE IT CAPTURES ALL HOSPITAL TYPES PUBLIC PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT INVESTOR OWNED. IT LOCAL. IN THE CONFLICT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO CREATE AN ADDITIONAL CONCURRENT AND REDUNDANT. PROCESS FOR NONPROFIT HOSPITALS WHICH pCONFLICTING REVIEWS FOR SALES. ALL THE BENEFITS OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS GROUP PATIENT COORDINATION AND CARE IMPROVE DISASTER RESPONSE GREATER FINANCIAL STABILITY AND SUPPORT FOR STRUGGLING HOSPITALS WHICH EXPLAINS THE BURDENS WELL BEYOND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND TO ALL OTHER PROVIDERS. TO DELIVER HEALTHCARE TOGETHER. AND THIS IS JUST HOW OF THE BILL. THE BILL ALL CREATES A ONE SIDED SYSTEM WITH NO MEANINGFUL APPEAL OR DUE PROCESS AND NEW ANTI TRUST LAWS THE PLACE THE BURDEN OF PROOF. ON THE PROVIDER AND A GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT SYSTEM. IT IS A PERMANENT TRANSFER OF ENORMOUS POWER. TO ONE ELECTED OFFICE. THE JUDGE AND JURY FOR THOUSANDS OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS YOU SIR. SHE CHAIR MEMBERS ARE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT POLICY REFORM TRANGER OVERSIGHT. INCLUDING EXISTING OVERSIGHT BUT NO IT'S NOT THE TIME AND THIS IS NOT THE VEHICLE. I WOULD- JUST NOTE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT THAT CAN BE MANAGED TODAY DO NOT REMEMBER OPPOSITION AND WE URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS. A MAJOR EVENT THANK YOU MEDICARE MEMBERS YES HI AMY DURBIN OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION. IN GENERAL THEORY OF SUPPORTIVE OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS DESIGNED TO ASSURE HOSPITAL MARKET COMPETITION HOWEVER THIS BILL GOES WELL BEYOND HOSPITAL ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS AND WOULD CAPTURE AND LIMIT AB AFTER A OF HEALTH TRANSACTION. INCLUDING LEASING AND OTHER CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL PHYSICIANS AND PROVIDERS NOT JUST HEALTH SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE CONTRACTS BETWEEN MEDICAL GROUPS AND HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE ON CALL SERVICES TRAUMA SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS REGARDING STOPPING PROVIDING SERVICES THROUGH TELEHEALTH. ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT BATMAN MEN'S CHANGING THE WORD AFFILIATION TO CHANGE OF CONTROL DO NOT CHANGE THE SCOPE OF THE BILL IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE THE DEFINITION REMAINS THE SAME IT STILL MEANS ALL ARRANGEMENTS AND AGREEMENTS PARTNERSHIPS AND LEASE REMAINS THE DEPTH IN THE DEFINITION OF ACQUISITION AS WELL. IN ADDITION THE FRAMEWORK OF THE BELT A SUBSTANTIALLY BALANCED FOR INSTANCE IT BROADLY CAPTURES HEALTH PROVIDER ARRANGEMENTS YET IT DOESN'T CAPTURE HEALTH PLANS UNDER THE SAME PROCESS BOTH EMAIL TO ALLOW PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS TO VIOLATE LAWS TO ENSURE OUR- QUALITY. CARE FRAMEWORKS THAT FOR THE BILL AS WELL WAIT TOWARD HIM AS WHICH BY MUCH IMPORTANT. NOT PROPERLY BALANCE WEAPONS TO WORK THE AS ACTS TO CARE. THAT MEANS THE NOT ONLY THE BILL FRAMEWORK ABOUT OF CON WITH AN PROVIDERS BUT IT WILL PREVENT THEM FROM BEING A- AND ALLOWED. THE LAST MAIN POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT THERE'S NO LIMITATIONS OR EXEMPTIONS IN THE BATTLE FOR ACCESS SMALLER PROVIDERS TRANSACTION RURAL AREAS. FOR INSTANCE THAT PROPOSED AMENDMENT REGARDING. MAINTAINING ACCESS OR CHANGING. THE SHELVES TO. DOES NOT CHANGE THE BROADER FLOOD FREE MARK WITH THE BROAD CRITERIA AND DEFINITIONS THAT MUST BE MET AND FELL. WHILE THAT ONE MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD AND SIMILAR AMENDMENTS RELATED TO EXPEDITE IT OR THIRTY OR SIXTY DAY AUTOMATIC PROCESS EITHER STATED ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT IMPACTS ON SMALLER PROVIDERS AND DECREASED. TRANSACTION MEETING APPROVAL THEY'RE ALSO NOT EXEMPTION ALL UP BACK. YOU STILL. NOTIFYING ME HE WHICH REVIEW CONNECTS HIGHLY TO DO FURTHER LET ME AND DELAY TRANSACTION. SO WE BELIEVE TO BE BY MISSPELLING GOOD WE ALSO BELIEVE IT'S- WRITTEN LEADING TO OF UNCERTAINTY AN ALREADY VERY UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT. DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS AND WE'RE WORKING TO THE OPERATORS OF ADDITIONAL AND FAST RESOURCES JUST TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. THIS BILL WILL ONLY FURTHER DECREASES OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS TO NECESSARY HEALTHCARE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOTE THAT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN THE CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION. JUST YOUR NAME AND POSITION ONLY PLEASE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE WILL GO TO THE WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE NO ONE IN THE WITNESS ROOM SO WE'LL GO TO THE PHONE SO THIS WOULD BE- PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION TO NINE SEVENTY SEVEN- WITH- NAME AND POSITION ONLY SO- MADAME MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINES.

NINE THREE NINETY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I AM THREE NINE NINE. HAVE NOT FOR THE LINE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WORKER COMMITTEE. MR BONTA. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AYE AYE EIGHT APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUS ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS AT AS YOU STATED IN OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS pDAY AND- I'VE ALSO HAD CAN'T STOP THE SPONSOR AND A NUMBER IN OPPOSITION. AND I THINK THE MEMBERS HELP MAKE CLEAR WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE NEED FOR THE CHANGE OF CONTROL. THE FOCUS ON A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OR PRIVATE EQUITY GROUP. OR HEDGE FUND OF IT BEING A PARTICIPANT IN AND NOT CHANGE OF CONTROL. ARM AND THE DEFINITION HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BEING SOMETHING OF A SYSTEM INVOLVING THREE HOSPITALS WHEN THE GENERAL ACUTE CARE. HOSPITAL IN CALIFORNIA SO I APPRECIATE ALL THAT CLARITY EVEN WITH THAT CLARITY I'VE HAD QUITE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AROUND- AB WORRY ABOUT OVER BREAT. AND PICK OUT OF CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT ENTITIES AND WHAT ARRANGEMENTS ARE CAPTURED BY THIS BILL. I UNDERSTAND IT KAISER HAS CONCERNED THAT ITS ENTIRE SYSTEM MIGHT BE CONTEMPLATED AND COVERED BY THIS GUY NO THAT'S NOT YOUR TENT- AND SOME OF THE SMALLER- ARRANGEMENTS- BETWEEN SMALLER PRACTICE GROUPS. I DON'T THINK IS YOUR INTENT AS WELL SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK THAT. YOU CONSIDER CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THOSE CONCERNS AND- PROVIDE. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO PROTECT HEALTHCARE PROTECT CONSUMERS PROTECT PATIENTS- I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT AND HOPEFULLY GET A CLEARER FORM. WHEN HITS THE FLOOR- IF IT GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE ON TO BEFORE THANK YOU SENATOR MONEY. THE CHAIR IF I MIGHT JUST COMMENT ON A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES BECAUSE- I THINK I WAS ABLE TO HELP CLARIFY IN OUR CONVERSATIONS AND- THE BREADTH OF THE OPPOSITION I CERTAINLY. RESPECT TO THE SELF INTEREST OF THOSE BUSINESS ENTITIES ASSOCIATIONS ETCETERA. BUT AGAIN THE THRESHOLD LANDS OF THIS BILL IS PROTECTING PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS SO THE QUESTION IS COME UP ABOUT- I THINK THERE'S BEEN AN OVER BREATH AND SOME OF THE OPPOSITION ABOUT. THE ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE CAUGHT UP THAT IF A PHYSICIAN GROUPS SOUGHT TO NEGOTIATE A LEASE. WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER IN THEIR OUNTY THAT SOMEHOW THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE REVIEW OF THE TOURNEY GENERAL. NO IT WOULD NOT- WITH THE NARROWING AMENDMENTS WE FURTHER FOCUS ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AS YOU MENTIONED BEING THREE HOSPITALS ONE OF WHICH HAS TO HAVE A CUTE KERR. THE KAISER EXAMPLE- THEY ARE A BIG HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BUT MY UNDERSTANDING. WHEN KAISER SETS UP A NEW FACILITY ITSELF INITIATES THAT IT'S NOT THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND AFFILIATIONS IT'S THROUGH. THEY START FROM THE GROUND UP IF THEY'RE BUILDING A NEW HOSPITAL OR STARTING A NEW PRIMARY CLINIC. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE KAISER MODEL- BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT A HOSPITAL THAT MAY BE IN DISTRESS. AND THERE'S A LARGER HELL CARE SO. THAT IS INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING THAT. THIS BILL DOES NOT BLOCK THAT IT DOES NOT PREVENT THAT IT DOES INSTITUTE A LEVEL OF REVIEW THAT IS CURRENTLY ONLY THERE IF AN ENTITY IS A NONPROFIT. A LOT OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET IS FOR PROFIT TO FOR PROFIT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GET EQUITY FUNDS AND HEDGE FUNDS THEIR NUMBER ONE ALLEGIANCE. IS TO THE SHAREHOLDERS. THE SHAREHOLDER SERVED BY GENERATING PROFIT. THIS BILL SIXTY EQUALIZE THAT LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN A FOR PROFIT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO PROTECT THE PATIENT AND THE CONSUMER SO AGAIN I APPRECIATE. YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR DRAWING OUT SOME OF THESE DISTINCTIONS FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING THANK YOU. VERY MUCH MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. CEREMONY I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARE TRYING TO DO- AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE COST OF HEALTH CAR CARE- ARE SKYROCKETING. I'VE HAD MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND AS I TOLD YOU WHEN WE FIRST STARTED VISITING A SAID. I ALWAYS I'M GONNA WATCH OUT FOR MY- DISTRICT AND I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT UNINTENDED. IN MY DISTRICT MY CONSTITUENTS CONSTITUENTS RELY ON VARIOUS PARTNERSHIPS AND STAFFING CONTRACTS FOR CENTRAL AND SPECIALTY CARE. BASED ON MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS HERE TODAY AND WITH MY LOCALS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS A BROAD VARIATION OF INTERPRETATIONS ON WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND DOES NOT CAPTURE. FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE BEEN HEARING CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL RESTRICTING RETIRING DENTISTS AND OPTOMETRISTS. STAFFING CONTRACTS TO KEEP OUR E. OURS OPERATING AND INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN FQHCS IN HOSPITALS. WHEN MY LOOK ARE CALLING ME SAYING THAT THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO BE CHILLING TO THEIR ABILITY CONTINUE TO OFFER BASIC CONTRACTS AND MAKE AGREEMENTS WITH COMMUNITY IN MIND. I HAVE TO TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. WHAT INSURANCES ARE THERE IN THIS BILL THAT BENEFICIAL ARRANGEMENTS LIKE THESE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. IT IS LARGELY THE SUBJECTIVE OPINION OF ONE OFFICE. THANK YOU. MANY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I DO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD ON THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION IT YOU JUST ENDED ON. SO THE ATTORNEYGENERAL WILL ASSEMBLE A BOARD OF ADVISORS WITH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL SECTORS INCLUDING COMMUNITY CLINICS HOSPITALS RURAL HOSPITALS INVEST GROUPS LARGE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS EVERY STAKEHOLDER AFFECTED BY THIS LEGISLATION. WILL HAVE A PLACE AT THE TABLE IMPORTANTLY. THIS BILL ALSO GIVES OUR COMMUNITIES A VOICE. TO SEEK OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THAT COMMUNITY THAT WE REPRESENT. THE HOSPITAL EXAMPLE OF A SOUL HOSPITAL THAT'S IN ECONOMIC THIS. IT IS THE ONLY PROVIDER TO THAT COMMUNITY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT SERVICE TO PROTECT ACCESS IN TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THAT'S WHY ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT. THERE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A DEMONSTRATION OF IMPROVEMENT OF SERVICE IT COULD SIMPLY BE THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT SERVICE WE ALSO HAVE A WAIVER. IN RAW DISTRICTS SOME OF YOUR ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WOULD QUALIFY AS A RURAL DISTRICT THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A WAIVER. FOR THAT REVIEW BASED ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE SERVICE AREA IT'S BEING SUPPORTED. I THANK YOU FOR THAT- I STILL THINK THERE IS SOME- QUESTIONS THAT SOME OF MY- CONSTITUENTS WOULD HAVE REGARDING THAT PARTICULAR RURAL AREAS I WILL SAY THAT- AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGEMENT. I WILL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. BECAUSE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH YOU AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE AN HONEST MAN WILL WORK HARD AT THIS AS WELL AS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. BUT I DO WANT TO GO ON RECORD THAT I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AGAIN WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE WITH THE OPPOSITION BEFORE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ON THE FLOOR AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS WHOLE THANK YOU. MR MAYS. I WANNA- THANK MY TWO COLLEAGUES BEFORE AFTER THEIR COMMENTS AND THEY'RE CONCERNED AND OBVIOUSLY CENTER YOU'VE DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK ON THIS- BUT- YOU AND I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE ANY CONVERSATION- AND I PREFER CONVERSATIONS FACE TO FACE- BEFORE THE- THE PANDEMIC WE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- AND BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WHEN YOU CAME IN MY OFFICE- I WOULD HAVE ACCESS PROBABLY MORE THAN LIKELY WALKED OUT OF THIS AND WALKED INTO GO BE WITH THE CHAIR ABOUT ABOUT IT MAYBE- THE AGUIAR-CURRY AND I WOULD HAVE HAD SOME CONVERSATION AND I WOULD HAVE. WENT OVER UP TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS THIS AND SAID HEY HAD- JAMES WHAT'S- HOW'S THIS GOING TO AFFECT OUR REGION- WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT AND YET THE BILL BEFORE US RIGHT NOW THE BATTLE FOR TODAY WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. IMPACT UPON OUR HEALTH SYSTEM AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE'S NOT A MEMBER IN THIS ROOM THAT FULLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THAT IMPACT GOING TO BE NOW MY GUESS IS MY GUESS IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A FEW MEMBERS THAT HAVE GOTTEN A PHONE CALL FROM A STATEWIDE ELECTED OFFICIAL SAID YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME THIS BILL GIVE ME A COURTESY BILL TO GET THIS. MY GUESS IS DON'T KNOW THAT TRUE BUT- THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS. I THINK IT'S PROBE FOR US RIGHT NOW AT THIS. TO PAY. TO TAKE APART. BRING THIS BILL BACK NEXT SESSION LET US DIG INTO THIS TO FOR OUT THIS IS THE PROP WAY TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THERE IS NO DOUBT- SENATOR. THAT THE PURPOSE BEHIND THIS BILL IS A IS A SINCERE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A VERY LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ACROSS US THAT WITH WHERE WE'RE STAND RIGHT NOW. THAT IS DONE SOMETHING THAT BAR MORE THAN LIKELY NOT APPROPRIATE BUT TO HAVE A BROAD BRUSH ACROSS THIS ENTIRE STATE. TO HAVE A POLICY LIKE THIS THAT WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND AND WE HAVEN'T FULLY DUG INTO I THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE SIDE BAG MY CALL TODAY. I URGE TO BE ABLE TO PUT A PAUSE ON THIS AND LET'S COME BACK NEXT NEXT YEAR TO WORK ON. ANYONE ELSE HERE. FIRST WHAT THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER ON THE PHONE- AND- YOU KNOW NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE TOUGH- IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING LEGISLATION THIS WORKABLE IN A LARGE ESTATE AS LARGE AND DIVERSE CALIFORNIA. IS A HUGE CHALLENGE. THE MAINTAINING ACCESS LANGUAGE ACCESS TO CARE LANGUAGE WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. THERE WERE MANY EMPTY AMENDMENTS THAT WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AND I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH ME AS WE STRUGGLE WITH THE EFFECTIVE COVERT NINETEEN HAS HAD ON OUR POPULATION ECONOMY MAKING SURE COMMUNITIES DON'T LOSE ACCESS TO CARE ESPECIALLY THROUGH A HOSPITAL CLOSURE. IS IMPERATIVE AND THAT MEANT THAT AMEND WILL ENSURE THE AG ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO HIM APPROVED CHANGE THE SECOND OF CONTROL THAT MAINTAINS RATHER AND ACCESS OF CARE. YOU KNOW I HAVE A HOSPITAL IN MY DISTRICT THAT- WAS ON THE REALLY ON THE ON THE ROPES. AND WAS WAS LOOKING AT CLOSURE- FORTUNATELY ANOTHER HOSPITAL SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO COME IN AND THROUGH AN OPERATING AGREEMENT THAT THAT AWESOME THAT HOSPITAL IS REMAINING OPEN THEY WILL ACTUALLY- BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM THEY WILL ACTUALLY ACHIEVE WHAT. YOU'RE WITH THE INTENT WAS ORIGINALLY WHICH WAS TO IMPROVE CARE I DO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THEIR SYSTEM. BUT THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITIES OUT THERE WHERE AN ACQUISITION OR OR CHAIN OF CONTROL. MIGHT JUST MAINTAIN IT N. AND THAT AND THAT MAY BE ENOUGH. FOR THAT COMMUNITY. I THINK THE HARD THING FOR ME- IS THAT. WE ARE WORKING TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO MAIN YOU KNOW. MAINTAIN THE COST OF CARE SO THAT IS REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE THIS IS A BILL ABOUT CONSUMERS. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE SYSTEM. THAT IS CLOSE TO US ALLOWED FOR THE INCREASE IN COST. FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BE 2230% HIGHER THAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE SYSTEM. THAT TO ME IS UNFAIR. AND THAT IS THE MEAT OF THE ISSUE THAT IS WHY THE BILL IS HERE. YOU KNOW YOU MAY ARGUE THAT THE BREADTH OF THE BILL AND ALL OF THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE ALWAYS TROUBLES ME IN THESE IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT I FEEL LIKE. THE EMPHASIS HAS HAS BEEN ON THE OPPOSITION TO MORE TO KILL THE BILL. THEN TO RECOGNIZE AND WORK WITH US IN A MINUTE. THE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH. THE COST THAT IT IS NOT AFFORDABLE ANYMORE. WHEN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE DOUBLE IS RISES AT TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AND RECOGNIZED THERE IS A PROBLEM. BUT AT TIMES THE INTERESTS ARE SO LARGE. THE INTERESTS ARE SO GREAT. THAT WE OFTEN IGNORE THAT NOW THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT OUR HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE LIFELINE TO US. RIGHT NOW ABSOLUTELY WHERE WE'D BE WITHOUT THEM. BUT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS. THERE ARE BAD ACTORS AND WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND SO I'M I'M GOING TO PRIVACY SUPPORTING YOUR BILL WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY ON THIS SIDE BY BETWEEN THIS BILL AND ANOTHER BILL WE HEARD EARLIER HI. YOU KNOW THEY WERE DONE THEIR MEMBERS AND BUDGET SURE WHICH BILL I WAS WORKING ON QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE THIS BEEN THAT IT'S BEEN THAT INTENSE BUT BUT I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS- YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE A GOOD MAN TO WORK WITH YOU'RE NOT OF A MAN YOU HAVE YOUR YOU HAVE YOUR HEART RIGHT. I BELIEVE THIS I BELIEVE THIS IS A BETTER BILL BECAUSE OF OUR WORK TOGETHER IS IT IS IT PERFECT WELL THERE IS NO PERFECT ALL AND HOPE THAT WE YOU KNOW THIS BODY WILL ALLOW THE WORK TO CONTINUE IF THERE IS A DESIRE FOR ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS AND- IT'S STILL TIME IN MY TIME WE GOT WE GOT THE ON. SO WE GET TO THE THIRTY FIRST OF AUGUST SO WITH WITH WITH THAT. I'M SORRY. WITH HAVE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO A CENTER MONEY THANK YOU VERY IS CHAIRMAN I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY AND I DO A THE ON AND JUST TO HIGH A COUPLE OF THE THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. THE OPERATING. OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS ARE CONSTITUENTS. THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE GIVEN OF IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NETWORK- THAT WAS PURSUED THROUGH ANTI ANTI TRUST AUTHORITY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THAT DIDN'T REACH CLOSURE UNTIL YEARS AFTER. THE PAYERS PATIENTS UNIONS THAT MAINTAIN COVERAGE FOR THEIR MEMBERS BUSINESSES THAT MAINTAIN COVERAGE FOR THEIR MEMBERS. IN A SETTLEMENT IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY OVER CHARGED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT LITIGATION NOBODY GOT A REMEDY. FOR FIVE YEARS SEVEN YEARS AND STILL IN LITIGATION. IT'S NOT JUST THAT ONE SYSTEM MEMBERS STATEWIDE LOOK IN YOUR DISTRICTS SOME MORE PRONOUNCED THAN OTHERS NOT MY WORD THAT USC UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA NEW YORK TIMES LA TIMES INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM RATES ARE GOING UP IN OUR COMMUNITIES. RATES ARE GOING UP IN A MANNER NOT COMMENSURATE TO THE COST OF LIVING. NOT COMMENSURATE TO THE COST OF SUPPLIES WERE PHARMACEUTICALS RATES ARE GOING UP BECAUSE OF MARKET DOMINATION. THAT IS ON STEROIDS RIGHT NOW PARTICULARLY DURING OUR ECONOMIC CRISIS. WE ARE THE LINE BETWEEN OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND THESE MARKET FORCES IT IS LONG AS WE LIVE IN A FOR PROFIT MEDICAL SYSTEM THE DRIVING MOTIVES. OF THESE LARGE SYSTEMS IS TO MAXIMIZE. YOU MAXIMIZE PROFIT BY MINIMIZING SERVICE. IN BY DOMINATING A REGION. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT US AGAINST. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOESN'T SEEK TO BLOCK TRANSACTIONS AFFILIATIONS THAT'S NOT MY INTENT OUR INTENT IS TO PROTECT. JUST QUICKLY IN MY OWN DISTRICT TWO EXAMPLES ONE WITH THE NONPROFIT IN SOUTH SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHERE A BUYER FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LARGE HOSPITAL NETWORK. SOUGHT TO SECURE AN AREA IN UNDERSERVED AREAS SOUTH SANTA CLARA COUNTY AN AGRICULTURAL AREA THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL KAMALA HARRIS WHO HAD JURISDICTION. BECAUSE IT WAS A NONPROFIT INVOLVED WITH THE PERFORMER PROFIT. TRIED TO SECURE A COMMITMENT FROM THE BUYER TO MAINTAIN EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES IN SOUTH COUNTY. THE BUYER WAS NOT WILLING TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT THE SALE WAS NOT APPROVED UNDER EXISTING LAW. THAT FACILITY WAS NOW ACQUIRED BY SANTA CLARA COUNTY. BY THE COUNTY HEALTH SYSTEM AND WE MAINTAINED SERVICES TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. FLIP OVER TO WATSONVILLE ONE OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE AVERAGE FAMILY INCOME EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FAMILY NOT INDIVIDUAL. PRIVATE WATSONVILLE HOSPITAL. FOR SALE IN DISTRESS BUT BY A HEDGE FUND. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH TRUST THE COMMUNITY BASED CLINICS WENT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE SERRA AND ASKED FOR HIM TO REVIEW THIS SALE TO PROTECT SERVICES IN WATSONVILLE AN HOUR AWAY FROM SANTA CRUZ EMERGENCY ROOM AN HOUR AWAY FROM SALINAS LIFE AND DEATH. THE GENERAL SAID SORRY I DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION. THIS IS A FOR PROFIT HEDGE FUND. FROM OUT OF STATE ACQUIRING A FOR PROFIT COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. SO THAT SALE WENT THROUGH. AND NOW THE COMMUNITY WAIT TO SEE ESSEL VALUABLE LAND OWNED BY THE HOSPITAL THAT THE COMMUNITY WANT TO USE FOR NURSING HOUSING HOUSING FOR NURSES. FOR CHILDCARE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. ON THE AUCTION BLOCK. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REVIEW A THORNY. WITH THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP. AND IT EMPOWERS FRIENDS OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC OUR COMMUNITY ADVOCATES. TO SAY THIS TRANSACTION IS TAKING PLACE MR OR MRS ATTORNEY GENERAL MILLS ATTORNEY GENERAL WE WANT YOU TO HELP US MAKE SURE. THAT WE PROTECT EXISTING SERVICES WHERE POSSIBLE THAT WE EXPAND SERVICES. WE ARE IN A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT IS IN CRISIS THAT IS DRIVEN ITS LIFEBLOOD IS PROFIT IT'S MOTIVATION SECONDARILY I WOULD SUBMIT IS CARE AND CONCERN FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE SIX SECTIONS TO THIS I'M. CONCERNED THAT MANY OF THE OPPONENTS WOULD NOT FALL UNDER THE SCOPE OF THIS LEGISLATION AND WHAT IN FACT BE PROTECTED BY IT. A GROUP OF OPTOMETRISTS ARE DENTISTS OR DOCTORS WHO WANT TO MERGE WITH EACH OTHER OR LEASE A BUILDING OR TWO GROUPS GET TOGETHER. THIS BILL THERE'S NO TRIGGER THAT. THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THAT REVIEW. UNLESS THEY HAVE A HEDGE FUND. OR AN INVESTOR GROUP BEHIND THEM AND EVEN THERE IT DOESN'T PREVENTIVE IT JUST SAYS OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO REVIEW AND MAKE SURE THE COMMUNITY IS PROTECTED.

SB TEN TWENTY NINE IS A DISTRICT BILL OFF SACRAMENTO COUNTY TO ESTABLISH A LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY THROUGH A COUNTY ORDINANCE THE HEALTH AUTHORITY WILL BE ABLE TO DESIGNATE WHICH PLANTS CAN COMPETE FOR THE STATE CONTRACT FOR MEDIC CAL PROVIDE ON GOING LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION FOR THE HEALTH OF GOING TO COUNTY TO ENACT OTHER FORMS LIKE TRANSITIONING TO A TWO PLAN MODEL COUNTY. FOR MANY YEARS SACRAMENTO'S GEOGRAPHIC MANAGED CARE MODEL HAS CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR BENEFICIARIES AND PROVIDERS ALIKE EXISTING SYSTEM IS FRAGMENTED LEADING TO ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS FOR PROVIDERS DIFFICULT EXCESS CARE FOR PATIENTS RADICALLY ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS BILL HAS BEEN THE LACK OF COORDINATION BETWEEN OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM HEALTH PLANS WHICH ONLY CORRECT. LEAGUE CONTRACT WITH THE STATE AND NOT GET ANY COUNTY OR LOCAL INPUT AND INTEGRATION WITH LOCAL- COUNTY PROGRAMS LIKE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THIS COURSE HAS BEEN EXACERBATED WITH KOBE- SO IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN A BROAD GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS BEGAN TO MEET TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND TO DEVELOP THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE MEDICARE ON SACRAMENTO AND pROBUST LOCAL OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY TO ALLOW THIS KIND OF. INTEGRATION AND PARTNERSHIP SO SB TWENTY NINE ESSENTIALLY DOES THAT THROUGH THE NEW HEALTH AUTHORITY SACRAMENTO STAKEHOLDERS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS PRESSING LOCAL MEDIC CAL ISSUES AND HELP DETERMINE THE PLAN TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SERVICES IN THE COUNTY IN THIS IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY SIMILAR TO WHAT MANY COUNTIES ALREADY HAVE IN THEIR OWN COUNTIES JUST THAT SACRAMENTO DOES NOT. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE COVER NINETEEN CRISIS EXACERBATES PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE STATE CUSTOM ESTABLISHING TISSUE BETWEEN. MEDIC COW WE REPRESENTS OF OVER. OF ALL OUR- PEOPLE IN THE SAN COUNTY INCLUDE COUNTING FOR HEALTH IMPROVE SEX COUNTY CAPACITY TO DRAW COVERT NOW.

ARBON OF HEALTH SERVICES DIRECTOR FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY I'M SPEAKING TO STRONGLY SUPPORT SB TEN TWENTY NINE FOR OVER TWO DECADES MEDI CAL SACRAMENTO IS THE RUN AS PART OF THE- MANAGED CARE SYSTEM UTILIZED ONLY BY SACRAMENTO AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY. HOWEVER SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAS FAR MORE ABILITY TO HOLD THE METAL CAL MEDI CAL MCOT COUNTABLE THEIR GMC STRUCTURE THANK TO LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE THAT THEY SACRAMENTO COUNTY. INDEED SACRAMENTO COUNTY HAS VIRTUALLY NO POWER TO HOLD MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR JURISDICTION ACCOUNTABLE EITHER ON HOW COMMON SATISFACTION METRICS. OR ON INFLUENCING CONTRACTS WITH THE MC OF. THIS LACK OF OVERSIGHT HAS RESULTED IN A SITUATION WHERE FOUR OF THE FIVE PARTICIPATING NGOS IN SACRAMENTO ARE IN THE BOTTOM QUARTILE OF ALL MEDICARE ALLEN CHAU STATE WIDE IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES. AT THE CENTER PAN IS MENTIONED. SB TEN TWENTY NINE GIVE THE COUNTY TEETH IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. IT'S SET UP A SACRAMENTO COUNTY MEDICARE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION THE POWERS THAT COMMISSION TO BOTH HOLDEN CEOS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACHIEVING CERTAIN GOALS AS WELL AS GIVEN THE POWER TO DO COUNTY TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN MCO WILL BE ALLOWED TO BID ON FUTURE MCO PROCUREMENT. BY STRUGGLING MEDI CAL NCOS WILL HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OVERSIGHT COMMISSION EVERY SPONTANEOUS CONCERNS THIS OVERSIGHT ABILITY WILL MOST CERTAINLY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ACCESS TO AND QUALITY OF. THAT CARE FOR THE COUNTIES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND MEDICARE RECIPIENTS AND I HAVE HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE. THANK YOU RYAN ALIVE IN FORTY TO PLEASE GO AHEAD. YEAH MY GOOD DAY CHILDREN NOW IMPORT YOUR.

VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR SENATOR PAM. MISTER NAZARIAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CENTER THIS BILL HAVE ANY STATEWIDE APPLICATION. CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN YOU ARE COURSE DOESN'T HAVE A STATEWIDE APPLICATION. SO CERTAINLY THIS BILL IS A DISTRICT BILL WOULD ADDRESSES AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. OKAY I THINK MANY OF US TO CARRY DISTRICT BILLS TO TRY TO ADDRESS INTERFACES BETWEEN STATE PROGRAMS THAT'S WHY REQUIRE A STATE BILL. AND THE LOCAL SITUATION. OKAY SO IT'S A VERY LOCALIZED BILL WITHOUT. IMPACTING OR BENEFITING THE ENTIRE STATE TO GIVEN THE PANDEMIC RAGING THROUGH THE STATE DOES THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE PASSED THIS YEAR. I WOULD SAY THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY WOULD IMPROVE THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHICH OF COURSE HAS TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITIES DURING KOBE AND OUR MEDICAL CARE SYSTEM THAT IS TAKING CARE OF THESE CODED PATIENTS AND SO IN FACT EVEN. BEFORE KOBE CAME THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL BUT CERTAINLY COVE IT HAS ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHTED HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY BE. PASSED HERE SO WE COULD ACTUALLY GIVE THE COUNT AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO. BRING THE PLANS AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TOGETHER SO THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO CONTACT OPENS UP THE- ACCOUNT. THOUGHTFUL ABOUT. HEALTH PLAN. DOES SO YOUR CLIENT REALLY. A COMPLAINTS YOU'RE BASICALLY TELLING ME THAT ESTABLISHING A LOCAL TWENTY MEMBER COMMISSION. WILL HELP THE SPREAD OF THE CORONA VIRUS. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT THE OPRAH SITE THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED AT SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHICH CURRENTLY HAS NO. AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE THE MEDICARE HEALTH PLANS ESSENTIALLY MEANS OVERSEE MEDIC COW AT ALL BECAUSE WE HAVE GEOGRAPHIC MANAGED CARE WOULD MEAN THAT THEREFORE THERE IS LITTLE INTEGRATION BETWEEN OUR MEDICARE PROGRAM WHICH COVERS YOU HEARD FROM DOCTOR PHELAN SENT. OVER YOU KNOW FOUR PEOPLE OR A THIRD A THIRD OF ALL THAT RESIDENTS OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY INTO PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S IN TYPE OF UNIT. THAT SHOULD HAPPEN AS POINT OUT THAT MANY OTHERS HE'S IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ACTUALLY IS. COUNTY INPUT INTO THEIR MANAGED CARE GRAHAM RELATED ATTIC HOUSE WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY OPERATE BECAUSE THEY AS A PLAN. EVERYONE PLAN. OR BMC WHICH TWENTY TWENTY IS THE ONLY OTHER COUNTY TO THAT THERE'S A LANGUAGE IN THERE THE CO TO ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE THAT INPUT TO THEIR DEGREE MATCH CARE PLANS HOWEVER IN SACRAMENTO DOES NOT EXIST SO THIS ESSENTIALLY ESTABLISHES DATAPOWER. AND IT HAS TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR THAT WENT IN A TIME WHEN WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING. ON THE CORVETTE NINETEEN IMPACTS AND MANY BILLS HAVE BEEN CAST ASIDE AND SACRIFICE THIS THIS YEAR IS THE YEAR TO DO THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO DIRECTLY IMPACT THE CORONAVIRUS ISSUE. I WOULD SAY IT CERTAINLY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE OF SACRAMENTO. THAT THIS HAPPENS AS I POINTED OUT THAT ACTUALLY THIS BILL WAS ACTUALLY INITIALLY DRIVEN BY THIS DISCONNECT BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR HEALTH AND OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM WHICH WE VERY INTENSIFIED EVEN PRE CODED. AS A SAID THAT AND SO THE FACT THAT KOVITZ COME ABOUT BECAUSE ONLY UNDERSCORED HOW IMPORTANT MOVING THE BILL FORWARD IS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH SERVICES ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MANY OTHER STATE THERE SO IS THE PART OF A PROCESS IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER A YEAR BUT I WOULD POINT. TOLD IS ONLY UNDER. THE BILL IS PARTICULARLY DURING ED OF THE- TO IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM. HI MR SHAPIRO MAYBE JUST. MAKING FINAL COMMENT. YOU KNOW I WE HEAR A LOT OF THINGS AND WE HEAR A LOT OF DIFFERENT ARGUING A CERTAIN. POINT BILLS HAVE BEEN HELD THAT HAVE DIRECTLY IMPACTED. AND WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES. RIGHT NOW. AND YET SOMETHING LIKE THIS IMPACTING ONLY ONE PART OF THE STATE IS BEING BROUGHT UP AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IN ANY WAY. BENEFITS THE ENTIRE STATE SO- I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THIS SENATOR. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR SENATOR PAM. XENON WILL BRING- WILL SAVE THE BILL DOES HAVE A DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS YES IN YOUR OPENING SO.

MOVING YES SIR FIFTY EIGHT SENATOR DINO. GOOD EVENING- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PRESENT SB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOUR STAFF AND MY STAFF AND EVERYONE FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY ON THIS BILL TO GET IT TO WHERE IT IS TONIGHT HOSPITALS ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE RESPONDED QUICKLY TO THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC. CONVERTING PHYSICAL SPACE TO SPEND MANY PROCEDURES AND SERVICES PURCHASING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR EMPLOYEES AND STAFF AND BRING ADDITIONAL STAFF AND MUCH MUCH MORE- WITH GREAT DEDICATED EMPLOYEES WHO GO ON THE FRONT NINE THREE SINGLE DAY. THE SHORT A LOT OF THE NEEDS AS WE READ IN THE PAPER AND SEE. EVERY DAY NO ONE SHOULD HAVE A LEVEL ONE. AFFECTED BY THIS PANDEMIC BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT JUST ABOUT EVERY FAMILY HAS- WITH NEARLY FORTY COUNTRIES ACTION WE COUNTIES ON THE WATCH LIST AND OVER EIGHT THOUSAND HOSPITALIZATIONS. HOSPITALS ARE ENGAGED IN AN UNPRECEDENTED RESPONSE TO THIS PANDEMIC. THE EFFORT IS CONSUMED PROPOSITIONAL CAPACITY AND DEVASTATED THEM FINANCIALLY MANY HOSPITALS THIS MEANS THEY MUST HALT ALL NON CRITICAL OPERATIONS AND RECONSIDER MAJOR EXPENDITURES THIS INCLUDES THE TWENTY THIRTY SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS. THIS MANDATE REQUIRES HOSPITALS TO RICH TO RETROFIT AND REPLACEMENT HOSPITAL BUILDINGS TO ENSURE THAT THE OPERATIONAL AFTER A MAJOR SEISMIC EVENT. ON AVERAGE HOSPITAL REBUILDING TAKES APPROXIMATELY TEN YEARS AND A RECENT REPORT ESTIMATES THE COST OF THE MAN THAT COULD BE OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS FOR HOSPITALS TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY DEADLINE- THEY WOULD NEED TO BEGIN DEVELOPMENT NOW. SENATE BILL SEVENTY EXTENDS THE DEADLINE FOR THE TWENTY THIRTY MANDATE TO TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN AND CREATES A STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE HOW CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM PREPARES IN RESPONSE. TO THE MASTERS OF COPS UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCED TOO MANY DISASTERS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE LEARNED MANY LESSONS THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE WILL EXAMINE OUR RESPONSE AND RECOMMEND GET YOUR PATHWAYS FOR STATE FOR THE STATE.

BEFORE BEGINNING TO MEET A SEISMIC OR OTHER DISASTER REQUIREMENTS FOR HOSPITALS IN THE IN MY DISTRICT AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS WILL BE CRITICAL. TO ENSURE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND DRESS. DISASTERS WE BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LARGELY ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS REGARDING THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION ON THE REMAINDER OF THE CONCERNS SHOULD THE BILL MOVE OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY. THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE AND WE'RE ALL READY TO DO IT. ON THE PHONE TEST OF I HAVE CAPTURE. AUSTIN SCOTT WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND KAREN.

SENATOR LONG NIGHT- I WANT I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FOR TO HELP OUR HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND HOW THE BILL IS DRAFTED TODAY. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THE PRIOR SEISMIC SAFETY EXTENSIONS HAVE ALWAYS INCLUDED TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS AND BENCHMARKS LIKE CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES. WHY IS THIS LEGISLATION GIVING AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN YEARS MORE TIME WITHOUT AY ASSURANCES THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN ALL HOSPITALS WILL ACTUALLY BE IN COMPLIANCE. I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE BROAD APPLICATION OF THE BILL I KNOW THERE ARE HOSPITALS ON TRACK TO MAKE THE TWENTY THIRTY SCHEDULE DEADLINE AND I BELIEVE THAT THOSE CAN'T ACCOMPLISH THAT THOSE THAT CAN ACCOMPLISH IT. SHOULD I LOOK FOR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND BILLS. I FEAR THAT FEAR THAT THIS PROPOSAL COULD ENCOURAGE HOSPITALS TO HAVE THE MONEY AND THE PLANS TO DELAY THEIR WORK. CAN THIS LEGISLATION BE LIMITED TO HOSPITALS THE SHOW TRUE FINANCIAL NEED FOR THIS EXTENSION. SINCE THESE BILLS ARE ONLY GOING THROUGH ONE POLICY COMMITTEE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. I BELIEVE WHAT THE OPPOSITION PROPOSED IS VERY REASONABLE. SINCE THIS BILL LANGUAGE WAS ONLY AMENDED IN JULY I WILL SUPPORT TO MOVE IT ALONG BUT I ASK YOU TO WORK WITH THOSE OF THE REQUESTED CHANGES BEFORE THE NEXT BOAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. THE REMEMBER CURRY A GUITAR CARRY ANYBODY ALSO QUESTION OR COMMENT FOR CENTER PORTANTINO. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO CENTER PROJECT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

THEIR REVENUE AND THEIR IN A CREASE THEIR COSTS I WOULD SAY THAT THE TIME HAVE CHANGED I THINK THE IMPORTANT. OF THE- MANY AND THE MAKEUP OF THE COMMITTEE I THINK IS GOING. TO ENSURE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT THE S. MEMBER HAS HAS REQUESTED I THINK THE CONCEPT OF BENCHMARKS TO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSED- I HAVE NO. DESIRE TO SEE ANOTHER AFTER COME BACK FIVE YEARS FROM NOW AND SAY WE NEED MORE TIME I MEAN THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A- BARS.

THE J. B. C. M.H. I. T. EASY FOR ME TO SAY. AND WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS PERMITS THE USE OF PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN JAIL. OF MAYBE YOUR COUNTY SAME AS MINE AN ORANGE COUNTY LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY ORANGE COUNTY JAIL OVER 30% OF THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED THE ORANGE COUNTY JAIL. NEED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT.

TO BE USED FOR HEALTH THREE IN JAILS SO IF A MATCH THE POT OF MONEY THE POT OF MONEY THAT EXISTS 5% AT POT IS DESIGNATED FOR INNOVATIVE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS. YES EIGHT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTES TO APPROVE THAT PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE BOARD THE BOARD. OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION IF THEY ALSO VOTE. TO APPROVE THE INNOVATIVE PROJECT THAT'S PROPOSED THEN IT MAY GO FORWARD BUT THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT. FIVE YEAR PILOT PROJECT ONLY IN EIGHT YET TO BE SPECIFIED COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THIS DOES NOT TAKE AWAY MONEY FROM OTHER. RESOURCES SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE NO MY CUNTY A CINEMA COUNTY WHEN THIS POT IS DIVIDED UP EACH COUNTY GETS A CERTAIN PORTION OF IT. THEY CAN USE IT SO LONG AS APPROVED BY THE REVISES AND ALSO THE BOARD THAT OVERSEES THE FUNDS. IF MY COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE USES THAT MONEY IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM NAPA COUNTY IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM ORANGE COUNTY. ALSO ONE OF THE OTHER PERHAPS MISCONCEPTIONS IT SOMEHOW IT WON'T BE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT INDEED. WITH THOSE TWO SAFEGUARDS WITH THE BOARD REQUIRING APPROVAL WELL AS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REQUIRING APPROVAL IT WILL CERTAINLY BE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT'LL BE PROVIDING THE TREATMENT TO THOSE WHO NEED IT IN OUR OFFICE.

IN ORANGE COUNTY ABOUT 30% OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION IS IN NEED OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADDITIONALLY APPROXIMATELY ONE FIFTH OF COUNTY JAIL INMATES ARE TAKING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION WHICH IS A 25% INCREASE SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. THE PROVIDER OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ORANGE COUNTY JAIL I RECOGNIZE THE SIMPLE REALITY THAT INCARCERATED PERSONS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE THE SAME PERSON SUFFERING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ORANGE COUNTY BEGAN AN INITIATIVE LAST YEAR CALLED THE INTEGRATED SERVICES VISION TO BETTER COORDINATE AND STRENGTHENED THE COUNTY SYSTEM OF CARE AND PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY PRIORITIZING BEHAVIOR HEALTH PREVENTION AND REENTRY EFFORT. INTENSITY BE HEALTH TREATMENT. IN CUSTODY VOCATIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COURT. IN FURTHER INTO DOUBT VISION THE COUNTY INVEST APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILLION ANNUALLY IN COUNTY GENERAL FUND TO SUPPLEMENT MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING IN THE JAIL. THE CREATION OF THE JAIL BASED COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH INNOVATION PROGRAM WILL ALLOW UP TO EIGHT COUNTIES TO USE AN HSA INNOVATION FUNDING WHICH COMPRISES 5% OF AN HSA REVENUES. TO HELP DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXPANSION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN COUNTY JAILS PROVIDES BETTER OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OF SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY AND WITHIN A COMMUNITY CHECK. THIS INNOVATION BROWN WOULD PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY TRACK AND TEST THE VALIDITY OF THE ARGUMENTS BEING MADE IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING THE FLEXIBILITY OF IMAGE MHSAA DOLLARS. TO FUND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN COUNTY JAIL. TO ENSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME IT IS ESSENTIAL TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS PEOPLE AND ENSURES THAT THERE IS NO DISRUPTION IN THE HEALTH SERVICES WHETHER THERE ARE COMMUNITY OR IN OUR COMMUNITY JAIL.

LINE FOR NINETY PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS STACEY HERE A MODEL WITH PEMCO THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES COLLISION IN STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK THAT'S IT. OKAY WE WILL BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR MAYS. I SENATOR IT IS NINE O'CLOCK MY GOODNESS- SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS- THAT IS COME UP AND ACTUALLY EVEN FROM MY LOCALS IT SEEMS TO BE NOT SO CLEAR THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS UP- IN YOUR YOUR OPENING- IS WHETHER THE COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR LOCALS AND GET TO OPT IN OR BUT MATTER OPT OUT OF THIS PROGRAM CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER IT BE OPPOSITION IF THE COUNTY THEMSELVES. WILL HAD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOCAL CONTROL SO CAN YOU DRESS THAT. I THANK YOU MR MAYES- I HEARD SOME COMMENT WITH RESPECT TO COUNTIES- SO FAR AS I'M AWARE THERE'S NO COUNTY THAT'S OPPOSED TO. EIGHT SB SIX SIX FIVE. THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT. EIGHT COUNTIES ARE ELIGIBLE. TO PARTAKE IN THE PROJECT NO COUNTY IS FORCED TO BE IN. NO COUNTY IS FORCED TO BE OUT AND INDEED IF I COUNTY OPS IN IN A PROPOSAL INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS. LACKING IN CRITICAL IS A HAND OFF FROM THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED TO THOSE WHO ARE RETURNED BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. SO IF I COUNTY DECIDES THAT THAT'S AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM THAT THEY WISH TO PURSUE. AND THEY GET APPROVAL FROM THE- THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY I SHOULD WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE- THE PROBE. OF THOSE. THEN THEY CAN DO SO BUT FORCED TO AND INDEED AS I SAID EARLIER IT DOES NOT TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM ANY OTHER COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE. THERE IS THOSE THAT ARE CONCERNED AT THIS MONEY MIGHT BE DIVERTED FROM ONE PROGRAM INTO A NOTHER PROGRAM. THE LOCALS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION EVEN THOUGH- THERE'S- EIGHT EIGHT OF THESE COUNTIES THAT CAN- THAT THEY CAN BE PART OF THIS. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE IF THEY'RE NOT FORCED TO BE THEY STILL RETAIN LOCAL CONTROL TO DO SO ABSOLUTELY CAPSULE. AT THE END THERE'S A PROVISION THE BILL THAT DOES NOT THAT FORBIDS THE SUPPLICATION OF FUNDS ANOTHER WORDS YOU CAN'T USE THIS MONEY BY HAND CUFFS. MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SB SIX SIX FIVE SIX TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES IN OUR STATE- IN FACT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN COUNTY JAIL AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT GETTING TREATMENT TO JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS WILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND HELP PEOPLE HEAL AND HAVE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY. I'VE STUDY THE ISSUES RAISED ON BOTH SIDES AND UNDERSTAND THE STILL SIGNIFICANT DEBATE ABOUT. THE USE OF M. H. ESSAY FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT I'M SWAYED THAT THIS IS INDEED APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT FURTHERS THE INTENT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT. THE PILOT ROOM IS LIMITED TIME IN SCOPE AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT SAFEGUARDS. BECAUSE OF THE DIRE NEED FOR THESE RESOURCES. TO PREVENT RECIDIVISM AND TREAT- URGENT BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES I SUPPORT THE BILL AND THEN KURT AND I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. MISTER ROBERTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- THANK YOU OF CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD I JUST WANT TO I KNOW WE TALKED- AND TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE ITEMS IN THE BILL AND I MENTIONED WHILE WE'RE ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE WORKED- WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO USE SOME OF THIS THESE DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS- SOMEONE GOING OUT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT FIREFIGHTERS ON THAT WAS ONE THAT MADE THAT MESSAGE WHAT THE- OUR- THE OFTEN STILL WOULD BE MADE AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION I. THERE THE FUNDING MECHANISM OF IT ALSO WOULD THAT BE AT THE LOCAL BOARDS DISCRETION OR WOULD THAT BE AT THE STATE- WITH THE DOLLARS COMING IN. SO IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. THE FUNDS ARE DIVIDED AMONG THE COUNTIES AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT IS IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ACTUALLY ANY ADDITIONAL MONIES OF THE INNOVATIVE FUN AND ALLOWS THE COUNTY TO USE THOSE INNOVATIVE PROBLEMS SHOULD THEY APPLY. TO BE USED IN THE JAIL FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SO THE LOCAL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS CONTROL OVER HOW MUCH MONEY IS SPENT OF THAT POT AND WHERE THAT MONEY IS SPENT OF THAT. NOW THEY DON'T HAVE EXCLUSIVE CONTROL BECAUSE THE BOARD THAT OVERSEES THE ALLOCATION THE USES PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY. ALSO HAS TO AGREE. NOW WE ALSO- TOUCHED ON- ONE OF THE OTHER TOPICS AS FAR AS- COUNTY JAILS AND SOME OF THESE FUNDING WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE BE USED IN THE IN THE STATE. PRISON SYSTEM RIGHT THERE IS- FELONIES AND THESE ARE THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT. BUT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT NOW IN THE COUNTY JAIL WE HAVE A MORE OF A I THINK THE THREE TIER. SENTENCES THAT ARE BEING- FOR PLAYED OUT IN THE COUNTY AREA SO HOW DOES THAT PLAY WITHIN THE DOLLARS. THE I THINK COME UP DOLLARS I'M GOING TOWARDS- THOSE TYPES OF- FELONIES IN THOSE TYPES OF PRISONERS THAT ARE FROM THE STATE. SO IT IS TRUE THAT SIXTY THREE MONIES CANNOT BE USED IN PRISONS AND THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO PRESENT THIS APPLIES ONLY TO. COUNTY FACILITIES OF INCARCERATION IT'S ALSO TRUE AS YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE SPENDING LONGER PERIODS OF TIME BUT- IF YOU'RE IN A COUNTY JAIL. OVERWHELMINGLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGE BY VENTURE TO SAY IT PROBABLY OVER ARE ARE CUTTING BACK. WELL TO BE SURE TO. HELP OF THE COMMUNITY. SO FOR US IN A PROBABLY ALL AGREE MIGHT PROVIDE A WHOLE. SOME TO PREVENT THEM FROM GOING A FACILITY BUT ONCE THEY'RE IN FACILITY BECOME BACK OUT. AND SIMPLY SAY WELL TOO BAD YOU LOSE YOUR IN JAIL NOW SO YOU DON'T GET ANY TREATMENT. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE SHORTS. THANK THANK YOU FOR THE SENATE OF AN I DO THINK THEY ARE GETTING SERVICES IN THE JAIL THIS HANDSOME. GRAHAM WITHIN THE JAILS I BUT- AND CERTAINLY WERE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE OF TRYING TO. MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT NEED SERVICES. GET THE SERVICES OF THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU. THAT'S CORRECT. THANK YOU SENATOR CAN YOU PLEASE- ADDRESS ON MY COLLEAGUES GOT A QUESTION IN TERMS OF ARE THESE TYPES OF SERVICES AVAILABLE NOW IN THE COUNTY JAIL WELL THEY VARY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY BUT YES THERE CLEARLY SOME COUNTIES THAT ARE PROVIDING MORE MENTAL SERVICE OTHER NEXT A- TO COUNTY IS THE- ADEQUATE SERVICE WITH ADEQUATE RE THEY NEED NOT. OKAY IN. THEY PUT THE NAY THOSE THERE ARE NONE OR AREN'T BEING USED EFFECTIVELY THEY CAN WITHDRAW. WELL I ASKED THE QUESTION BECAUSE AND L. A. COUNTY IN SPECIFICALLY IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- THAT I REPRESENT. ARE MY CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COUNTY SHERIFF'S HAVE BEEN THAT THE JAILS ARE INCREDIBLY OVER POPULATED. THERE IS A LOT OF NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE- AND THE DEPUTY SHERIFFS DO NOT HAVE TO BE. THE SOURCES THE TRAINING THE RULES. TO DEAL AND MANAGE. A LOT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDING RESOURCES SO I THINK THIS IS A AN AN INNOVATIVE APPROACHES THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY. IS BERMAN LOW. AND WHAT ABOUT. AIR I THINK A MINUTE BUT NINETEEN THE MENTAL STRESS THE JUSTIN MEANT BEHAVIORS AND GEN STRESS THAT BOTH PEOPLE THAT ARE INCARCERATED AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE FACILITIES ARE FACING IS VERY REAL. AND SO I YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. WELL FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK. WHAT. CAN I GET THE PARA CONECTAR OTHER COMMENTED ON COUNTY IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ACTUALLY NOT THIS IS THE TIME FOR THE FOR THE MEMBERS TO DELIBERATE SO I APPRECIATE DO YOU WANT TO PAY FOR THEIR BUT THAT'S THAT TIME IS OVER NOW. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I WAS THANK YOU SKINNER AMBERG- SB SIX SIXTY FIVE IS AN OUTSIDE THE BOX IDEA. MAYBE NOT COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE BOX AND SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BEING DONE IN OTHER PLACES BUT BUT CERTAINLY- IT ENCOURAGES. INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO IMPROVING THE CONTINUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE FOR CITIZENS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. IS NOT DEGRADE THE JAIL TO BECOME THE STATE'S MENTAL INSTITUTIONS PER PER MENTAL HEALTH IN CITY REMAIN. INDIVIDUALS WHO OFTEN GOING TO JAILS HAVING NEVER RECEIVE THE SERVICES IN THE OR I DON'T FEEL. ONE HABIT TEABING COMMUNITY BASED CARE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THERE ISN'T A SMOOTH TRANSITION A CARE PLAN TO THE- FAILURE NUMBER TWO. WHEN PEOPLE ARE RELEASED FROM JAIL. THERE'S THERE ALSO MAY NOT BE A WARM HAND OFF BACK TO COMMUNITY BASED CARE. THIS RESULTS IN PEOPLE DROPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND OUT OF CARE ONLY TO CYCLE THROUGH RETURNED TO JAIL AT SOME POINT IN THEIR IN THEIR FUTURE. WITHOUT EVER RECEIVING THE NAVY THE NEEDY CARE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THAT'S FAILURE NUMBER THREE. I HAVE TO BELIEVE THERE'S A BETTER WAY. I AGREE WITH YOU MR BURKE THAT IT'S TIME FOR JAIL IN OUR COMMUNITY BASED. HEALTH BAKER SERVICES TO FOCUS NOT ON THIS THIS SYSTEM OVER. OVER THE OTHER OR WHO CONTROLS THE MONEY. BUT TO INSTEAD FOCUS ON COORDINATED. WHILE. JUST ONE MORE THING TONIGHT. ONE OKAY. ADD ME BACK UP TO THAT SENSOR. APPARENTLY IT WAS A REAL SHOCKER- I HAVE TO BELIEVE THERE'S A BETTER WAY I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S TIME FOR A JAILER COMMUNITY BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOCUS NOT ON THE SYSTEM OVER THE- OR WHO CAN. THAT FOCUS ON COORDINATED EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE IN THE NEED OF CARE ARE RECEIVING THE CARE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO FROM THE COMMUNITY REGARDLESS OF THEIR LOCATION WITH COMMUNITY. SB SIX SIXTY FIVE IS A NARROWLY FOCUSED PILOT PROJECT. THAT PROHIBITS SUPPLANTING WHICH YOU POINTED OUT OVER OVER FUNDING OVER OTHER FUNDING SOURCES IT LIMITS IS THE FUNDS TO BE USED TO THOSE THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATED FOR THE INNOVATION FUNDING 45% THE COUNTIES IN JUST A MONEY. BUDGET INCLUDE. PUTTING THE COUNTY THREE YEAR. IN COUNTY THREE YOUR STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN MHS PLAY MHA IS I MET AN HSA PLAN AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THE OVERSIGHT THAT YOU SPOKE OF. IT MUST BE ADOPTED BY THE COUNTY BOARD. IS AN ALL OF THE BY THE COMMISSION JUST WE SAID AND- REQUIRES GREAT. EDUCATION COLLABORATION AND INTEGRATION BETWEEN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL STAFF AND JAIL PERSONNEL IN THE REMOTE PATIENT STATUS MEETINGS AND PLANNING SESSIONS. MY BELIEVE IS YOUR BILL WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT DATA TO SUPPORT IMPROVED THANK YOU IN COMMUNITY IN THE COMMUNITY'S RESPONSE TO THE TREATMENT OF MENTALLY. INDIVIDUALS WHETHER THEY'RE- NOT. FOR THESE REASONS. I SUPPOSE YOUR BILL I THANK YOU FOR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OUR CITIZENS THANK YOU SENATOR OF BURKE WOULD YOU LIKE TO QUIT- THANK YOU CHAIR ANY COMMENT ON MY WOULD TRACK FROM VERY ELOQUENT THING YOU ORIGINAL VOTE ON I'M JUST BE FOR ANOTHER.

WE NEED TO MEET THE PHONES PLEASE IF POSSIBLE. YOU ARE NOT LAST BUT NOT LAST BUT NOT LEAST YOUR OF YOUR VERY WELCOME IN OUR CHAMBER SENATOR WIENER. I'M GONNA INTRODUCE A BILL TO REVERSE ALPHABETICAL ORDER I THINK IN. TRUST ME AS A SOMEBODY ELSE AT THE END OF THE ALPHABET I LOVE THAT IDEA YEAH THE MINORITY WE ARE AND I WILL CALL IT AS A- BILL TOGETHER. HAHAHA SORRY. PLEASE PLEASE PROCEED WITH THAT SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE. OKAY I THANK YOU- MRS HERE FIRST I WANT TO. I THANK THE CHAIR AND ALSO THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING ON VERY HARD WITH US- ON THIS- BILL- AND WE- WILL BE. MAKING THE- AUTHOR AMENDMENTS ARE CONTAINED IN OUR SERVICE- THERE ARE NO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE ALL THE ROOMS. WE WILL BE MAKING UP EXCEPT. ARE WE WILL NOT BE- REMOVING THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY AFTER DIALOGUE WE DECIDED. NT TO DO THAT OUR GOVERNMENT THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR. WORKING WITH US. ALSO GOING TO. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. I'M WITH PARMA MANAGE HEALTHCARE. ON THE OUT OF NETWORK PROVISIONS IN THE BILL FURTHER REFINING THAT. MEASURE ACCOMPLISHING OUR- OUR GOAL. I'M CALLING. TO SB FIFTY FIVE. I THANK YOU VERY VERY SIMPLE EVERY. I HEALTH INSURANCE. TO COVER ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION. THAT YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF WHY DOES NOT REQUIRE A BILL- IT'S SORT OF COMMON SENSE OF A DOCTOR UNDER PREVAILING STANDARDS. SAYS THAT YOU NEED THIS TREATMENT FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH OR ADDICTION THIS ORDER. ARE YOU SHOULD BE COVERED FOR UNFORTUNATELY OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE VERY FREQUENTLY REFUSING TO COVER. ANY KIND OF. EARLY INTERVENTION OR BASIC CARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION. ARE ONLY COVERING PEOPLE IF THEY ARE ALREADY A CRISIS. THEY'RE ALREADY GOING TO THE SITE EMERGENCY ROOM THEY'VE ALREADY LOST THEIR JOBS AND THEIR HOUSING THEY'RE ALREADY SO IT'S DETERIORATED. I DO TOO. OKAY CHEN. THEN THEY ONLY OFF COVERED FIRST TERM. OCT CARE TO GET THEM STATE AGAIN AND THEN THE COVERAGE AND- SHOULD BE THE SAME AS SAYING. WHAT WE KNOW YOU WERE JUST DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE ONE CANCER. COME BACK AND SEE US WHEN YOU'RE A STAGE FOR AND WILL COVER YOU THAT. WE WOULD NEVER EVER IN A HUNDRED YEARS TOLERATE THAT. AND YET WE HAVE TOLERATED THIS FOR MENTAL HEALTH. CONDITION AND WE HAVE A CONCEPT OF PARITY AND THE US AND IN CALIFORNIA THAT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT MENTAL HEALTH AFFLICTIONS. ARE DIFFERENT THAN PHYSICAL ILLNESSES AND WE SHOULD TREAT THEM THE SAME WE HAVE A TERRIBLE CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVEN'T. DONE ENOUGH. CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH PARITY LAW IS. INSUFFICIENT IT LEAVES OUT SOME OF THE MOST COMMON AND SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THE CURRENT PARITY LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER PTSD TREATMENT OR TREATMENT FOR GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER OR FOR A NEW OR USED DISORDER OR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER BINGE EATING DISORDER. FOUR MAJOR NEW AUGMENTED THE ORDER DO TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. THESE ARE SEVERE CONDITIONS AND YOUR CURRENT LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT AND TO BE CARP. BECAUSE HELP IS FOR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IS OFTEN SO LIMITED AND WHAT IT WILL COVER FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CARE. WE SEE PEOPLE IN THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY. CANCEL THE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND SIGNED UP FOR MEDI CAL. BECAUSE MEDIC CAL WAXAY COVERAGE SO THE TAXPAYERS ARE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG. COLLEAGUES WE HAVE BEFORE COVERED WE HAD A CRISIS AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S ONLY GETTING WORSE- AND WE SEE IT HAPPENING EVERY DAY INCREASES IN OVERDOSE- JUST GROWING MENTAL PROBLEMS THIS BILL WILL HAVE.

PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT DUE TO THE TRAUMA INFLICTED BY COKE IT'S NINETEEN. SB EIGHT FIVE FIVE HELLO THIS MAJOR GAP IN CALIFORNIA LAW THAT ALLOW INSURERS TO DENY COVERAGE FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE WITH IMPUNITY. CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT APPLIES ONLY NINE MENTAL ILLNESSES AND EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCES OF A CHILD. THIS IS INDEFENSIBLE GIVEN THE PREVALENCE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND COUNTLESS OTHER TREATABLE DISORDERS INTO MINE. IT IS ALSO INDISPENSABLE THE CALIFORNIA LAW LACK THE UNIFORM DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY AND DOES NOT MANDATE THAT INSURANCE MAKE COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT BUT GENERALLY ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF CARE. AS A RESULT OF THE GAPING HOLE CALIFORNIANS ARE ROUTINELY DENIED AFTER MEDICALLY NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ENSURE THAT PRIORITIZE PROFITS OVER CARE. SB EIGHT FIVE FIVE REQUIRED INSURERS TO MAKE COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS PURSUANT TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF CARE. SET FORTH BY NONPROFIT CLINICAL SPECIALTY AT FIFTY ASIAN RATHER THAN BUY INSURANCE. HOME COOKED GUIDELINE. WE YOUR BEHAVE HEALTH FOR THE PRIME. OF AN INCH DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE COVERAGE CRITERIA FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. FOLLOWING A TEN DAY BENCH TRIAL AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST HEALTH INSURER HEADQUARTERED IN SAN FRANCISCO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA FOUND THAT YOU'D BE JUST FINANCIAL CONFLICT INSPECTED A GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. AND THAT OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PATIENTS INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WERE WRONGLY DENIED OUTPATIENT INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT AND RESIDENTIAL SERVICES. BASED ON CRITERIA THAT WERE INCONSISTENT WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED STANDARDS CARE. IN MY EXPERIENCE AS THANK A FAIR BIT AND THE TO. YOU B. H. IS NOT ALONE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SYSTEMATICALLY LIMITS COVERAGE FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BATES AND ACUITY AND QUITE THE STANDARD. RATHER THAN ACCOUNTING FOR DISEASE GRANITE CITY AND SUPPORTING GENUINE RICK.

ALL ENSURE AT THAT THE BAKED ON STRICT ADHERENCE GEOGRAPHIC AND TIMELINESS STANDARDS. AND GUARANTEE THAT WRONGFUL COVERAGE DENIALS I REVIEWED BY COURT A FRESH. RATHER THAN THROUGH THE LENS OF UNDUE DEFERENCE. LIKE ANY OTHER PARTY TO CIVIL LITIGATION INSURANCE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DEFEND THEIR CONDUCT ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU RIDE ONE EIGHTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS ONLY AVAILABLE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. OKAY I THINK THAT BELIEVE THAT'S TEN NOW SO- WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AB TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SO MADAM MODERATOR YOU CAN OPEN THE LINES FOR A BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE NICK LOUISA'S AND PRESTON YOUNG. THANK YOU BYE BYE. GREAT THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NICKEL WINDOWS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS WELL WE'VE TAKEN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB EIGHT FIVE HAVE GENERALLY OPPOSES MANDATE BILLS BECAUSE THE INCREASE THE COST OF CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND EMPLOYERS. HAVING SAID THIS WE ARE TAKING THE RARE STEP OF OFFERING AMENDMENTS TO A MANDATE BILL SPECIFIC EIGHT FIVE THAT RETAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF EXPANDING COVERAGE TO INCLUDE ALL WILL HELP SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. WE'RE ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING MANDY CREATED BY THIS BILL. IS IT REALLY THE PRIMARY ISSUE FOR OUR MEMBERS- DESPITE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE OFFERING THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. BERMAN HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS BASICALLY UNIVERSAL IN CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE. NINETY NINE POINT 8% OF ENROLLEES IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAVE COVERAGE FOR THE SERVICES OUTLINED IN THIS BILL. AT PARITY WITH OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT- OUR OBJECTIONS REALLY OUR FOCUS ON THE CERES A FUNDAMENTAL AND PRECEDENT SETTING POLICY CHANGES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS MEASURE- AS WE PROVIDED THE AUTHOR WITH AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE QUALITY OF CARE AND COST IMPLICATIONS OF THIS MEASURE. IN WITH YOU TENSION OF ONE AMENDMENT TO ONE PARAGRAPH OF THE BILL ON WHICH WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR HAS REGRETTABLY TAKEN ALMOST NO SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED EITHER BY THE ENTITY THAT WILL IMPLEMENT THIS BILL. FOR THE STATE REGULATOR THAT ONE FOR IT. SO WE'RE LEFT WITH THE SERIOUSLY FLAWED BILL. THAT IS LARGELY PREMISED ON A FEDERAL COURT CASE- THAT IS FAR FROM FINAL IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STATE REGULATED OR LICENSED HEALTH PLAN PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE USING THIS CASE IS NOT ONLY BAD POLICY BUT A BILL TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORK THE PLAN REGULATORS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE ACCOMPLISHING ON THIS ISSUE. BUT THE BILL ALSO WISELY FUN WISELY. ME ATTEMPTS TO CODIFY DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR A SUBSET OF SERVICES. DESPITE THE FACT THAT PLAN CRITERIA IS ALREADY SUBMITTED TO STATE REGULATORS FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. THIS DEFINITION WOULD WOULD CREATE CONFUSION AND DISPARITY I MUST BE REMOVED- INITIALLY IT APPEARED THAT THE AUTHOR WAS REMOVING THIS DEFINITION AS INDICATED IN YOUR ANALYSIS BUT APPARENTLY THINGS HAVE CHANGED- THE BILL ALSO SHIFT COSTS SHIPS COSTS AWAY FROM PUBLIC PROGRAMS IN ON TO EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET- IT DOES NOT DEFINITIVELY STATE THAT PROVIDERS AND THE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. CENTERS DELIVER THESE SERVICES MUST BE LICENSED- INVESTIGATE THE USE OF LEGITIMATE CHECKS AND BALANCES TO COMBAT. THE POTENTIAL FRAUD WASTE AND ABUSE PARTICULARLY IN THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SPACE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLANS ARE DEDICATED TO DELIVERING THE SERVICES- WE KNOW THEY'RE A LONG TERM CHALLENGES BUT WE MUST DEAL WITH THEM COLLECTIVELY. ON AND USING GOOD EVIDENCE AND ENTER THAT POINT YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS. THE CALMATTERS ARTICLE THAT CAME UP IN THE AUTHOR'S STATEMENT- YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY EXISTING DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE THAT PATIENTS ARE BETTER SERVED BY COUNTY RUN MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES. OF I DIDN'T THINK. IS TREND REALLY HAPPENING. THE RUBIO BE ARCTIC CITES THE- STATISTIC. ABOUT THE FROM. OF DROPPING COMMERCIAL COVERAGE IN GOING TO CAO A PROGRAM. ACTUALLY SO THERE'S NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT- AND WE BELIEVE IT'S RECKLESS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DROP THEIR PRIVATE COVERAGE TO SEEK COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE- THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER MEDICAL SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD LOSE. ON IN THAT PROCESS SO- WE DON'T USE ANY EVIDENCE FOR THE USE THAT ARTICLE- IN ANY CASE- WE'VE OFFERED AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. THERE ARE TWO. AREA BUT THE BILL MAY IS THAT ISSUE ALL A MATTER MISS THE MARK INCREASE AND CONSEQUENCE. FOR THESE REASONS CAP MUSTERS OPPOSE EACH FIFTY FIVE UNLESS IT IS. AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- PRESTON YOUNG. YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESS TWO YOUNG FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB FIFTY FIVE THE OVERARCHING CONCERN WE HAVE AND THE REASON FOR THE OPPOSITION IS THE FACT THAT THIS BENEFIT MANDATE AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. ARE GOING TO BE PASSED ON TO THE INSURED POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA CORRECT EARLY EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AND ACCORDING TO THE TRIP URBAN ALICE'S I THINK THE PREMIUM INCREASE THAT WERE LOOKING OUT WITH SB FIFTY FIVE WOULD BE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS NOW. AND IT IS LIKE BEING COVERED POLY CAME OUT WITH AN ANALYSIS WITH THE ANTICIPATED PREMIUM WRAPPING ANYWAY 44% IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE DUE TO THE UNANTICIPATED COVERT RELATED CAR EVER EXPERIENCED. THIS YEAR. FOR NOW THE LATER ON IN. PREMIUM ON OF WHAT CONTENT GET 40% THINK IN PRE TO THE TWENTY ONE. IT'S GOING FROM A DIFFICULT SITUATION AND IT'S MAKING IT THAT MUCH MORE AND MANAGEABLE SO. WHEN WE'RE HAVING THIS THIS SURROUNDING HEALTH IN THE CARE TO BE PERCENT USE DISORDER IT IS A LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION TO BE SURE. BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THE FULL PICTURE HERE. AND UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT THAT THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT IS GONNA BE PAID FOR RENTERS SO IT'S FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE THAT SPEED FIFTY FIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL LAST NOW THE MODERATE TO OPEN THE LINE FOR- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION JUST THEIR NAME AND OR A POSITION ONLY NAME ORGANIZATIONALLY- AND WILL TAKE TEN TEN CALLS ON THAT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF SENATOR WIENER. THE MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS A MEMBER OF THE STANFORD FIVE YEAR INITIATIVE ON ADDICTION IN THE BRAIN WE HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE IS A VERY PHYSICAL READ FOR ADDICTION AS WELL AS WE LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH IT ALSO INVOLVES DIRECTLY PHYSICAL HEALTH. THIS BILL MODERNIZES A- MUCH NEEDED MODERNIZATION OF CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT NO WE LOOK AT THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST OBSTACLES. TO CARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH IS THE LACK OF PRIORITIZATION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN PARITY WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND YOU KNOW IN IT AND WHEN YU ADD IN STIGMA TO THAT THE NEW GOT THIS THIS WHOLE- A PROBLEM WHERE ABOUT 50% JUST UNDER 50% OF THE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE NOT GETTING TREATMENT WE LOOK AT ALSO THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS ANNUALLY AVERAGE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE NUMBER OF VISITS TO PHYSICIANS OFFICES WITH MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDER FIFTY SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION ANNUALLY THIS IS ALREADY A BIG COST TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WHEN ARE WE LOOK AT OUR- MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ARE INTRICATELY BOUND TOGETHER ACCORDING TO THE CDC. MENTAL ILLNESS AND WE JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE DEPRESSION- CAN INCREASE THE RISK FOR MANY PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. ESPECIALLY LONG LASTING ONES LIKE STROKE TYPE TWO DOVER DAVIES AND HEART DISEASE AND SIMILARLY- THE REVERSE IS TRUE THE PRESENCE OF HEALTH CARE OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS CAN INCREASE THE RISK FOR MENTAL ILLNESS. SO THIS AS I SAID IT'S ALREADY A BIG COST IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE CAN INCREASE I THINK THE RATE OF TREATMENT IF WE FOR ONCE DURING MENTAL HEALTH. ARE TREATMENT INTO PARITY WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH. SO IT NEEDS TO GET THERE AND- WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEEDED TO DO THAT FOR A LONG TIME I REGION I WILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON ANY OTHER MEMBERS LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION I HAVE A COMMENT. C.
