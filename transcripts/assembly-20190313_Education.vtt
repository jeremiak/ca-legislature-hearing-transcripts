00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:13.712
I SAW FIRST HAND.

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:16.147
THE POWER OF THE CURRICULUM THAT

00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:18.617

00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:22.654
CULTURE.

00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:23.989
WHEN WE LOOK AT WAYS OF

00:25:24.055 --> 00:25:26.524
IMPROVING PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION?

00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:28.927
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AT EDUCATION

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:30.562
ACHIEVEMENT GAP?

00:25:30.629 --> 00:25:32.831
AND WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO REMEDY

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:35.533
THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.701
WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE

00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:38.637

THE THOSE ARE ONE WAY OF GOING

ABOUT TRYING.

00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:47.979
TO A THE CULTURE OF EDUCATION.

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:49.981
BUT ANOTHER WAY OF CHANGING THE

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:53.285
CULTURE OF EDUCATION IS LOOKING

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:54.552
AT WHAT IS TAUGHT.

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:57.455
WHAT IS TAUGHT WHAT IS INCLUDED?

00:25:57.522 --> 00:25:59.424
AND WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED.

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:02.027
WHEN I WENT THROUGH --

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:03.828
PUBLIC -- MY

00:26:03.895 --> 00:26:05.764
EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAM AT UC

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.499
RIVERSIDE.

00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:08.033
I LEARNED ABOUT THE HIDDEN

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:09.134
CURRICULUM.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.137
AND THAT THAT IS WHAT IS IMPLIED

00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:13.538
OR WOULD STUDENTS LEARN.

00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:15.440
A NOT WHAT IS IN THE TEXTBOOK

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:17.208
BUT WHAT THE WAY THEY ARE

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:19.110
PRESENTED WITH MATERIAL A WHAT

00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:21.880
IS VALUED AND WHAT IS NOT VALUED.

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:24.316
AND TOO LONG FOR TOO LONG.

00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:28.453
IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS --

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.388
WHEN WE DO NOT INCLUDE STUDENTS

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:33.692
CULTURE STUDENTS HISTORY?

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:34.993
STUDENTS BACKGROUND WHERE THEY

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.395
COME FROM THE STORIES OF THEIR

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:38.296
FAMILIES.

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:41.399
WE IMPLICITLY SEND A MESSAGE

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:43.802
THAT THAT CULTURE THAT HISTORY

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:45.203
IS NOT A VALUE.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.438
BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN THE

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:49.941
CURRICULUM IT IS NOT TAUGHT.

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:51.776
WHEN I WAS TEACHING ETHNIC

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:53.244
STUDIES CHICANO STUDIES AT POLY

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.814
HIGH SCHOOL I I HAD A STUDENT IN

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.816
MY CLASS WHO WENT TO OUR HISTORY

00:26:57.882 --> 00:26:58.817

00:26:58.883 --> 00:26:59.884
SHE WENT OUR HISTORY TEACHER AND

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:01.920
SHE ASKED HER HISTORY TEACHER

00:27:01.987 --> 00:27:03.955

IN EAST LA OF THE STUDENTS.

00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:09.094
AND APPARENTLY THAT US HISTORY

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.929
TEACHER WAS NOT AWARE OF IT.

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:13.264
SO IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THE US

00:27:13.331 --> 00:27:14.799
HISTORY TEACHER I TOLD HER THAT

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:18.803

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.872
WE NEED TO CHANGE T

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:24.075

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.351
PEOPLE.

00:27:33.418 --> 00:27:35.120
THAT WE CAN DRAW THE CIRCLE

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:36.321
BRINGING PEOPLE IN.

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:37.322

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.628
IF WE DRAW THE CIRCLE TO INCLUDE

DISCIPLINE.

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.887

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:28.406
AND I WAS LOOKING BEHIND ME I

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:29.107
THOUGHT MAYBE --

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:30.742

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:43.822
IT HAS EXISTED.

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:46.191
IT IS BEEN TAUGHT.

00:28:46.257 --> 00:28:47.792
BUT WE'VE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:49.861
THAT CORRECT THEM TO BE INCLUDED

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:50.862
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:52.330
CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF OF

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:54.766
BEING A LEADER.

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.801
BEING A LEADER IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:28:56.868 --> 00:28:58.503
BUT OTHER STATES ARE AHEAD OF US

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.772
IN CALLING FOR ETHNIC STUDIES

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:02.974
STATES LIKE VERMONT [inaudible]

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.577
CONNECTICUT WASHINGTON.

00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:07.545
INDIANA HAVE ALL CALLED FOR

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:11.483

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:14.352
STATE IN THE NATION.

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:16.488
OUR STUDENTS DESERVE TO LEARN

00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:18.590
ABOUT THEIR PAST THEIR CULTURE

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:22.327
THEIR HISTORY.

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:24.229
ETHNIC STUDY WILL NOT SOLVE ALL

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:26.264
OUR PROBLEMS.

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:27.799
BUT I THINK ETHNIC STUDIES IS A

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:29.501
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:30.869
THAT THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:33.538
AT NOR OF HIGH SCHOOL IN OH HI.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:36.107

CUPS.

00:29:40.778 --> 00:29:42.480
SO THAT THINGS LIKE THAT WON'T

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:44.682
HAPPEN AS OFTEN.

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:47.185

00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:48.012
FROM THAT UNIQUE EXPERIENCE.

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:49.681
THE TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT THAT

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:52.150
IT'S HAD ON STUDENTS THAT THESE

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:53.551
TWO HIGH SCHOOLS --

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:56.487

SO I THINK THE MORE THEY CAN

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:29.647
LEARN ABOUT THEMSELVES.

00:37:29.714 --> 00:37:30.214

CONCERNED ABOUT THEMSELVES IS

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:33.784
ONLY A GOOD THING --

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:35.286
TO GIVE THEM YOU KNOW SOME PRIDE

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:37.388
FOR SURE --

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.557
BUT ALSO BELIEVE NO WE KNOW

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:40.324
WHERE THEY FIT IN THE WORLD SO

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.560
THANK YOU FOR FOR FOR FOR TODAY

00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:45.930
DON'T SEE ANY OTHER.

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.698
A DOCUMENT YES I SORRY I WAS

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:48.966
LATE TIED UP IN ANOTHER

00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:50.868
COMMITTEE BUT I AM PROUD TO BE

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:52.203
ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS ON THIS

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:53.137
BILL WITH MOST MEDINA.

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.505
WHO HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:56.641
OF TIME WORKING ON IT --

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:58.042
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW I SPENT

00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:59.443
FORTY YEARS TEACHING ETHNIC

00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.977
STUDIES AT SENEGAL STATE

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.145
UNIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE

00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:02.146
FOUNDERS OF THE DEPARTMENT.

00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:03.781
AND ONE OF THINGS THAT ALWAYS

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:04.982
STRUCK ME WAS THAT --

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:06.384
WHEN STUDENTS CAME INTO THE

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.952
DEPARTMENT FOR WHATEVER REASON

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:09.520
THROUGH WHATEVER MEANS --

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:10.955
THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT NOT ONLY

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:12.690
THEIR OWN HISTORY BOOK ABOUT THE

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:13.591
HISTORY THE PEOPLE WHO SAT IN

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:14.925
THE ROOM WITH THEM WE WENT TO

00:38:14.992 --> 00:38:15.826
SCHOOL WITH THEM.

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:17.495
AND SO I ALWAYS THEY ALWAYS FELT

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:18.763
SOMEHOW ANOTHER THEY HAD BEEN

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:19.764
BETRAYED BY LAW SO YOU KNOW WHEN

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.465
THEY GOT TO THE UNIVERSITY AND

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:22.400
IT TOOK AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.734
AND THEY DISCOVER THEY LACK SO

00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:24.735
MUCH INFORMATION.

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:28.673
AND THESE WERE CONSIDERED OUR

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:32.176
BEST AND BRIGHTEST STUDENTS JUST

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.144
AS EARLIER WHY DID WE KNOW THIS

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:33.844
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT.

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:36.047
AND AND IT WAS REALLY CLEAR THAT

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:37.882
WE IF THAT WOULD REALLY GOING TO

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:39.717
DEAL WITH EDUCATION EVEN AT THE

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:41.218
UPPER LEVEL WITH BEGIN IT EARLY

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:42.420
SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:42.953
IT.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.389
AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT I DID

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:47.191
TEACH AN EPIC STUDIES COURSE OF

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:49.026
IN ON I AFER SCHOOL AT ONE OF

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:49.894
THE HIGH SCHOOLS FOR SEVERAL

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.729
YEARS -- AND

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:52.263
WAS INTERESTING HOW MANY

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:54.832
STUDENTS CAME WITHOUT CREDIT

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.767
AFTER SCHOOL FOR A BLACK HISTORY

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:57.601
COURSE.

00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:59.236
WHO WANTED TO KNOW THE MATERIAL

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.771
WHOSE BEHAVIOR CHANGED IMMENSELY

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:02.606
AS A RESULT OF OF KNOWING THE

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:03.974
MATERIAL IN TERMS OF THEIR

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:04.542
PERFORMANCE IN THEIR OTHER

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:05.543
CLASSES?

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:07.244
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS AMAZING TO ME

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:08.746
THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SHOWED

00:39:08.813 --> 00:39:08.913
UP.

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:10.981
AFTER SCHOOL THEY HAD A HALF DAY

00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:12.049
IN THE TO GO HOME THEY SHOWED UP

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:13.884
REGULARLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:14.919
COURSE TO LEARN ABOUT BLACK

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:15.853
HISTORY.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.455
AND SO AND IT WAS NOT ONLY

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:18.289
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS THAT

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:19.690
WILL ALSO ASIAN AND LATINO

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.258
STUDENTS WHO CAME TO THAT COURSE

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.594
AS WELL SO I THINK THE IDEA OF

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:24.562
STUDENTS WANTING TO KNOW WHO

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:25.963
THEY ARE YOU KNOW HAVING SPENT

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.498
ALL MY YEARS IN UNIVERSITY.

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:29.600
AND NOT STUDYING ETHNIC STUDIES

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:31.702
AT ALL UNTIL I BECAME A GROUP

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:32.770
PHD STUDENT --

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:33.904
THAT YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S A

00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:35.840
SENSE OF LOSS YOU KNOW THAT YOU

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:36.640
COULD HAVE MAYBE DO WHO KNOWS

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:37.274
WHAT YOUR LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:37.475
LIKE.

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:38.809
IF YOU WOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:40.211
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:41.545
BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT EVEN

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:43.180
THOUGH AS MUCH AS I KNOW ABOUT

00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:44.482
AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY I STILL

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.050
FEEL AN ADEQUATE IN TERMS OF

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:46.584
KNOWING MORE ABOUT LATINO

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.118
HISTORY.

00:39:47.184 --> 00:39:52.323
AND I'M CONSTANTLY READING BOOKS

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:55.192
AND TRYING TO IF IT MORE KLAY

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:57.228
TEACHING ART BUT EVERYBODY

00:39:57.294 --> 00:40:01.298
THAT'S A HAS BEEN A PART IN

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:02.433
AMERICAN HISTORY IT MAKES AND

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.667
STRONGER IT MAKES MORE

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.269
RESPECTFUL OF EACH OTHER.

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:07.071
AND IT JUST ENHANCES OUR LIFE

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:08.205
SIGNS I'M PLEASE WITH THIS IT'S

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:09.473

SIXTY NINE BLACK STUDIES THEY

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:14.812
BEGIN THE MOVEMENT IN CALIFORNIA.

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:15.813
AND IS TAKEN FIFTY YEARS FOR US

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.747
TO HOPEFULLY GET TO THIS POINT

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.115
WHERE WE REALLY GOING TO TAKE IT

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:20.651
SERIOUSLY IN TERMS OF PART OF

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:21.318
THE RIGHT THE CURRICULA TEACHING

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:21.485

THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER IN FACT

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.691
MY OLDEST BROTHER WENT ALONG TO

WE WENT TO SAN DIEGO STATE AND

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.628
TOOK AN IRISH HISTORY COURSE

00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:30.861
THERE.

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:31.729
ON OVER THE ETHNIC STUDIES I

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:32.830
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:34.465
BUT AFTER THAT I KNOW MY FAMILY

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:35.933
BECAME MORE AND TURN INTO

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.301
WHETHER WITH OUR HISTORY FOR

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:39.203
SURE IN LONG BEACH UNIFIED DOES

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.670
A GREAT JOB.

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.138
AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:43.240

00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:51.081
STUDIES.

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:51.749
AND I THINK THEY ACTUALLY GO ON

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:52.850
THE WEEKENDS IT'S NOT DURING THE

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.018

DO SEE AS A POSITIVE GETTING

KIDS UNDER THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.

00:40:58.222 --> 00:40:59.957

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:02.326
STATE NOW ALBEIT NOT EVERYWHERE

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:05.129

AND VERY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:21.946
FOR CHILDREN.

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:23.447

01:51:18.138 --> 01:51:20.673

CAREER APTITUDE TEST.

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:26.679
AND A I KNOW THAT THERE'S A THIS

01:51:26.746 --> 01:51:28.381
HAS BEEN AN EXERCISE THAT SOME

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:30.650
PEOPLE BELIEVE IS.

01:51:30.717 --> 01:51:33.253
NOT WORTHY AND I HAVE TO TELL

01:51:33.319 --> 01:51:35.688
YOU THAT THE REASON THAT I

01:51:35.755 --> 01:51:37.357

READING MY NOTES AT AT ALL ALL

01:51:39.225 --> 01:51:40.226
IS --

01:51:40.293 --> 01:51:41.828
ACTUALLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH

01:51:41.895 --> 01:51:44.197
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SEEN

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:45.532
THAT -- E

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:47.067
HAVE MANY STUDENTS SPENDING

01:51:47.133 --> 01:51:48.701
QUITE A LONG TIME AT THE

01:51:48.768 --> 01:51:50.437
COMMUNITY COLLEGES --

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:53.540
SOMETIMES FOUR FIVE EVEN SIX

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.241
YEARS IN PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE

01:51:55.308 --> 01:51:57.444
MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT DO GO

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:59.212
TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUST

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:00.780
AREN'T SURE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

01:52:00.847 --> 01:52:03.016
AND EVEN THOUGH SOME OF US HAVE

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:04.918
TAKEN THESE TESTS I KNOW I DID

01:52:04.984 --> 01:52:07.821
WHAT MANY MANY YEARS AGO THEY'VE

01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:09.122
EVOLVED.

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:11.191
AND SOME HAVE SAID WELL IF YOU

01:52:11.257 --> 01:52:12.125
TAKE THE TEST WHEN YOU'RE A

01:52:12.192 --> 01:52:13.927
FRESHMAN WHAT IS THAT GOING TO

01:52:13.993 --> 01:52:14.494
TELL YOU ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE

01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:15.395
SENIOR.

01:52:15.462 --> 01:52:16.129
OF I THINK OUR INTERESTS

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:18.765
INVOLVED BUT THE KEY IS TO AT

01:52:18.832 --> 01:52:20.900
LEAST START TO GIVE STUDENTS

01:52:20.967 --> 01:52:23.403
INFORMATION OR SOME TYPE OF

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:25.371
DIRECTION NOT SOME OF OUR

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:28.241
PREMIUM PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN

01:52:28.308 --> 01:52:30.443
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE LIKE THAT

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.977
GRAHAM.

01:52:31.044 --> 01:52:32.779
STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT

01:52:32.846 --> 01:52:36.015
BEFORE THEY EVEN REGISTER AND

01:52:36.082 --> 01:52:38.818
WITHOUT ANY DIRECTION WE SEE NOW

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:41.054
MORE AND MORE WITH THE ONLINE

01:52:41.121 --> 01:52:43.189
INFORMATION STUDENTS DON'T EVEN

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:45.325
GET TO A CAMPUS. TO REGISTER TO

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:46.559
EVEN FIND OUT ABOUT VARIOUS

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:49.028
PATHWAYS ABOUT IF THEY'RE EVEN

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:50.930
INTERESTED IN SOME TYPE OF SITE

01:52:50.997 --> 01:52:53.399
PROGRAM THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:55.168
AND SO WE HAVE STUDENTS KIND OF

01:52:55.235 --> 01:52:56.503
FLOUNDERING WHEN THEY GET TO

01:52:56.569 --> 01:52:57.770
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR OTHER

01:52:57.837 --> 01:52:58.671
COLLEGES.

01:52:58.738 --> 01:53:00.840
SO WHY DO I THINK THIS IS SUCH A

01:53:00.907 --> 01:53:03.543
NEW IDEA IT REALLY ISN'T NEW.

01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:05.245
AND IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT

01:53:05.311 --> 01:53:06.613
COULD NOT BE IMPROVED BUT I

01:53:06.679 --> 01:53:08.114
WOULD LIKE TO SEE STUDENTS

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:10.717
EXPOSED --

01:53:10.783 --> 01:53:12.452
TO IT'S TAKING A TEST I'M

01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:13.453
WILLING TO TAKE --

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.622
THE AMENDMENTS FOR THIS BILL BUT

01:53:15.688 --> 01:53:17.590
REALLY HOPE THAT ALONG THE WAY

01:53:17.657 --> 01:53:19.192
WE COULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT.

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:22.128
BECAUSE HAVING SOMEBODY GO TO A

01:53:22.195 --> 01:53:23.897
WEBSITE UP THAT'S JUST NOT

01:53:23.963 --> 01:53:25.999
HAPPENING MOST OF US DON'T GO TO

01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:28.535
WEBSITE ESPECIALLY HIGH SCHOOL

01:53:28.601 --> 01:53:30.170
STUDENTS SO.

01:53:30.236 --> 01:53:31.871
THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS

01:53:31.938 --> 01:53:34.474
I'VE BEEN ASKED NUMEROUS TIMES

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:36.910
BY COLLEGE COUNSELORS TO THEIR

01:53:36.976 --> 01:53:38.545
SEEN STUDENTS WHO HAVE NO

01:53:38.611 --> 01:53:39.913
DIRECTION.

01:53:39.979 --> 01:53:42.182
AND HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN EXPOSED TO

01:53:42.248 --> 01:53:46.819
ANY TYPE OF OF OPPORTUNITY TO AT

01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:48.588
LEAST PART TAKEN ONE OF THESE

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:50.456
ASSESSMENTS THAT DOES NOT MEAN I

01:53:50.523 --> 01:53:51.824
WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON

01:53:51.891 --> 01:53:53.226
IT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT EVEN

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:55.395
SPEND A LOT OF CLASS TIME ONE

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:56.896
PERIOD --

01:53:56.963 --> 01:53:59.332
WOULD COULD BE TAKEN TO TO HAVE

01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:01.167
THEM GO ONLINE AND CLASS EVEN IF

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:03.403
THAT SET SO I KNOW THAT'S MORE

01:54:03.469 --> 01:54:07.373
THAN WHAT THE BILL SAYS.

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.842
BUT BUT I WILL TAKE THE

01:54:09.909 --> 01:54:12.345

01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:19.138
EVOLVING INTO THAT.

01:56:19.205 --> 01:56:22.442
BUT I REALLY THINK OF SO MANY

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:24.644
STUDENTS DON'T KNOW ABOUT MANY

01:56:24.711 --> 01:56:26.612
OPPORTUNITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:56:26.679 --> 01:56:28.247
VISITED PARAMEDIC PARAMOUNT

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:30.516
STUDIOS THIS LAST.

01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:33.252
WEEK AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

01:56:33.319 --> 01:56:35.254
EVERYTHING FROM OF COURSE THE

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:36.422
ACTORS BUT YOU HAVE THE

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:39.592
CARPENTERS ON SITE YOU HAVE THE

01:56:39.659 --> 01:56:41.361
LIGHTING ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT

01:56:41.427 --> 01:56:45.031
NOT ONLY TRADES BUT ALSO CAREERS

01:56:45.098 --> 01:56:46.866
AND SO OFTEN --

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:48.634
STUDENTS KIND OF FEEL LIKE THEY

01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:50.036
HAVE TO TAKE ONE PATHWAY AND WE

01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:51.204
KNOW THAT THERE'S SO MANY MORE

01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:54.340
MORE OPTIONS AND SO I'VE SAID

01:56:54.407 --> 01:56:56.843
THIS I KNOW I'VE TALKED TO

01:56:56.909 --> 01:56:59.679
DOCTOR WEBER ABOUT THIS.

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:02.248
AND PART OF IT IS LET'S LET THEM

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:05.151
HAVE A MENU AND LET THEM START

01:57:05.218 --> 01:57:06.652
TO UNDERSTAND LIKE WHAT DO I

01:57:06.719 --> 01:57:08.855
NEED TO DO TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:57:08.921 --> 01:57:09.856
FUTURE.

01:57:09.922 --> 01:57:11.758
AND SO EVEN IF IT SAYS YOU WANT

01:57:11.824 --> 01:57:15.228
TO BE A MORTUARY SCIENTIST.

01:57:15.294 --> 01:57:19.198
THERE IS A MORTUARY RIGHT AWAY.

01:57:19.265 --> 01:57:19.565
THAT WAS RIGHT.

01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:21.968
AT BUT THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE

01:57:22.034 --> 01:57:24.971
WHERE YOU CAN BUILD.

01:57:25.037 --> 01:57:27.507

01:57:32.712 --> 01:57:33.913
OKAY -- ALL

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:34.881
RIGHT BUT REALLY WHAT I REALLY

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:36.215
THINK YOU WANT IS EXPOSURE.

01:57:36.282 --> 01:57:37.383
AND I I I DON'T THE CONTEST IS

01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:38.718
EXPOSURE BUT AYE AYE.

01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:40.987
THIS CONCEPT IS EVOLVING WE CAN

01:57:41.053 --> 01:57:42.822
INVOLVE AREA THERE.

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:44.257

EXPOSURE IS THE KEY PART OF IT

01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:02.975

01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:00.099
VALUE IN --

01:59:00.166 --> 01:59:00.266
IN.

01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:03.703
IN EXPOSING AND AND WHAT TO

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:04.337
CREATE MEANS IN THOSE KINDS OF

01:59:04.403 --> 01:59:05.338
THINGS --

01:59:05.404 --> 01:59:06.472
AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU WORK ON

01:59:06.539 --> 01:59:07.573
THIS BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:08.574
BECAUSE I THINK WHEN YOU SEE

01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:10.009
APTITUDE TEST.

01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:11.577
THAT IMMEDIATELY TURNS PEOPLE

01:59:11.644 --> 01:59:13.412
OFF BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW IT'S

01:59:13.479 --> 01:59:14.981
BEEN SO MUCH WORK DONE ON HOW

01:59:15.047 --> 01:59:16.415
APTITUDE TEST Và REALLY NOT

01:59:16.482 --> 01:59:17.683
VERY EFFECTIVE.

01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:18.684
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO TELL

01:59:18.751 --> 01:59:19.719
PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:59:19.785 --> 01:59:21.220
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF AND

01:59:21.287 --> 01:59:22.021
I THINK IT WOULD PASS SOMETHING

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:22.655
THIS IS.

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:23.656
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO TAKE AN

01:59:23.723 --> 01:59:26.692
APTITUDE TEST THAT IS WHAT WILL

01:59:26.759 --> 01:59:27.994
TRANSLATE DOWN TO THE OTHER

01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.462
PEOPLE IF IT PASSES IN GETS

01:59:29.529 --> 01:59:30.463
FUNDED.

01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:31.864
THEY'LL BE AN APTITUDE TEST

01:59:31.931 --> 01:59:33.766
VERSUS TALKING ABOUT CAREER

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:35.167
CHOICES CAREER OPTIONS LIFE SKI

01:59:35.234 --> 01:59:36.736
ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

01:59:36.802 --> 01:59:37.670
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE

01:59:37.737 --> 01:59:39.005
EXPOSURE OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO

01:59:39.071 --> 01:59:40.273
CAREERS --

01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:41.908
THAT MANY OF THEM ONLY GET YOU

01:59:41.974 --> 01:59:43.109
KNOW YOU GET YOUR TEACHER YOUR

01:59:43.175 --> 01:59:45.011
DOCTOR YOUR LAWYER OR MAYBE AN

01:59:45.077 --> 01:59:47.246
ENGINEER BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT

01:59:47.313 --> 01:59:48.314
WHAT ELSE IS INVOLVED IN THE

01:59:48.381 --> 01:59:49.982
TEACHING PROFESSION IS MORE THAN

01:59:50.049 --> 01:59:50.283
BEING IN.

01:59:50.349 --> 01:59:51.484
FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM THEY

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.886
DON'T KNOW WITH SO I THINK GO.

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:55.755
CAREER EXPLORATION IS EXTREMELY

01:59:55.821 --> 01:59:57.523
IMPORTANT --

01:59:57.590 --> 01:59:59.325
AND SO I HOPE BEFORE THIS GETS

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:00.293
TO THE FLOOR THAT THE TURN

02:00:00.359 --> 02:00:02.061
APTITUDE TESTS IS SOMEONE OF THE

02:00:02.128 --> 02:00:03.829
DEFINED IN ANOTHER WAY BECAUSE

02:00:03.896 --> 02:00:05.965
IF IT PASSES AS AN APTITUDE TEST

02:00:06.032 --> 02:00:07.500
IT WILL BE AN APTITUDE TESTS.

02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:09.835
AND AND THAT WILL NOT GO WELL

02:00:09.902 --> 02:00:10.636
FOR STUDENTS.

02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:13.706
