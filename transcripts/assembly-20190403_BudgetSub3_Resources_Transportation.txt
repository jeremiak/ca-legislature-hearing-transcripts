I COULD ASK A THE MEETING TO COME TO ORDER -- WE OBVIOUSLY ARE LACKING A QUORUM RIGHT NOW -- SO WE WILL PASS OVER THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR AND AND RETURN TO WHEN WE WHEN WE ARE STEP OF THE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. AND WILL MOVE TO ITEMS TO BE HEARD. OUR FIRST -- ISSUE. IS -- THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN AND FOR THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRESENTATION -- BY -- I THINK MISTER BROWN -- THE A FOR ON BEHALF OF THE ALEJO. AND IT -- A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK IT'S GET AWAY AS WELL SO WELCOME. PLEASE PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ROSS BROWN WITH THE LA -- I'M GONNA GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S CAP AND TRADE -- EXPENDITURE PLAN PROPOSAL AND PROVIDE SOME OF OUR COMMENTS I'M GONNA BREAK IT INTO KIND OF TWO DIFFERENT SECTIONS I THINK ALL START OFF PROBABLY WHICH IS TO A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE CONDITION OF THE G. G. R. OUT. SOME COMMENTS AROUND KIND OF WHAT THE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ARE AND WHAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE AND HOW THEY COMPARE THE MINISTRATIONS. WHAT THAT MEANS FOR KIND OF OVERALL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR SPENDING -- AND THEN GET INTO SOME OF THE MORE DETAILS AND OF THE ACTUAL PROPOSALS FOR SPENDING AND OUR COMMENTS AROUND THOSE PROPOSALS -- SO FIRST OUT MAYBE CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE TABLE ON PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. WHICH GIVES A KIND OF SUMMARY OF THE REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND FUNDBALANCE -- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S ASSUMPTIONS AROUND REVENUE AND THEN SOME OF OUR ESTIMATES AROUND WHAT REVENUE WILL BE -- JUST TO GO OVER SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND TWO POINT ONE BILLION AND THE BUDGET YEAR -- THERE ARE PROPOSING FOR THE BUDGET YEAR A TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SPENDING PLAN THAT INCLUDES -- A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION AND KIND OF EXPENDITURES THAT COME OFF THE TOP TO CERTAIN -- COMMITMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST AS WELL AS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS BASED ON THE REVENUE ESTIMATES. AND OVER ONE BILLION IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ALL GOOD AND TO THAT PROPOSAL IN MORE DETAIL IN JUST A MINUTE -- AND UNDER THOSE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WOULD WOULD BE LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FUND BALANCE -- WE'RE PROJECTING THAT REVENUE OVER THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR WOULD BE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASSUMING IN THEIR PROPOSAL -- ONCE YOU KIND OF TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS THAT AUTOMATICALLY GET ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS PROGRAMS -- WE'RE PROJECTING THAT UNDER THOSE READ OUR REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS -- THERE WOULD BE ABOUT A FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND BALANCE. AND SO THERE'S STILL QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND REVENUE BUT WE DO THINK THAT THERE WILL BE MORE RACES OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASSUMING -- WE STILL THINK IT'S DEFINITELY PRUDENT TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY FUND BALANCE BUT UNDER OUR PROJECTIONS WE DO THINK IT WOULD BE -- IT COULD BE REASONABLE TO ALLOCATE SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATED A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE. IT WOULD STILL BE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BALANCE IN THE FUND IN WHICH WE THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A REASONABLE PLACE TO BE. SO IF I COULD INTERJECT A QUESTION EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION IS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT. IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN ASSUMPTIONS -- THAT THE LA YOU LA ALWAYS USING OVER PART IN THE FINANCE OR IS IT JUST AN EXPECTATION. YEAH SO WHAT WE SETTLED SOME BACK AND FORTH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT I I THINK THE KEY DIFFERENCES IN ASSUMPTIONS ARE ROUNDS. ASSUMPTIONS AROUND HOW MANY ALLOWANCES WILL BE OFFERED AND SOLD. OVER THE NEXT YEAR PLUS. I THINK WE BOTH ASSUME THAT ALLOWANCE PRICES WILL STAY AT OR CLOSE TO THE FLOOR AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN RECENT YEARS -- WE JUST HAVE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW MANY ALLOWANCES OR ARE BEING OFFERED -- WE WE ASSUME THAT YOU ALL OF THE ALLOWANCES SO IT CLOSE TO THE FOR PRICE WHICH HAS BEEN CONSISTENT -- ALMOST ALL THE ALLOWANCES SO CLOSE TO THE FOR PLACE WHICH HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HAD IN THE IN THE LAST YEAR TO THANK -- THE SECOND POINT. I WANT TO NOTICE JUST LOOKING AT KIND OF A MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK -- WE DO THINK AGAIN UNDER KIND OF THOSE SIMILAR TYPES OF CONDITIONS OF ALLOWANCE PRICES UP THE FLOOR AND ALL OF ALMOST ALL THE ALLOWANCES SELLING. REVENUE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS WOULD BE CLOSE TO TWO POINT FOUR BILLION AND SO -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT AGAIN KIND OF ALLOCATING THIS 60% A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS AND SOME OF THE OTHER EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD LEAVE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING SO WE THINK? YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN THINKING ABOUT MAKING ONGOING AND MULTI YEAR COMMITMENTS THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT NINE HUNDRED MILLION. UNDER THAT SCENARIO WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND FEET AND THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS -- AND THEN LASTLY A MORE OF A TECHNICAL ISSUE THERE IS SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE REVENUE UNCERTAINTY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD HAVE SOME. AUTHORITY TO REDUCE ALLOCATIONS TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS -- IF REVENUE COMES IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED -- WE THINK THAT GENERAL PROVISIONS REASONABLE WE JUST WANNA KINDA HIGHLIGHT MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THE AUTHORITY THEY HAVE TO REDUCE -- CERTAIN PROGRAMS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIOR HOW IT LOOKS LIKE -- PRIORITIZES DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. I'M NOT A NEXT OLD JUMP INTO SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THE SPENDING PLAN ITSELF SO ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. IT HAS A LIST OF THE EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD BE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM -- AT A HIGH LEVEL. A LOT OF THE EXPENDITURES ARE FOR PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FUNDING IN THE PAST I THINK ONE KEY EXCEPTION AS THERE'S A NEW WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL THAT'S AND UNDER OTHER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- YOUR AGENDA SINCE THE NOTE THAT THAT THAT PROPOSAL TO BE HEARD IN A DIFFERENT SUBCOMMITTEE SO I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT IN IN DETAIL -- I DO WANNA HIGHLIGHT FOR THE SECOND TWO CATEGORIES ON THE ON THE TABLE THE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING WE'VE GOT A BROKEN IT UP INTO. TWO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ONE IS EXISTING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING SO. THOSE ARE PROGRAMS FOR THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY TAKEN AN ACTION OR GIVEN SOME INDICATION THAT WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS IN. PREVIOUS YEARS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR FOREST RELATED ACTIVITIES AND SB NINE A ONE THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR -- SOME -- MULTI YOUR COMMITMENT FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. AND THEN THE SECOND CATEGORY THE OTHER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING WHICH IS -- IN THE BUDGET YEAR FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION THOSE ARE -- KIND OF MORE WANT NEW KIND OF ONE TIME EXPENDITURES A LOT OF THEM ARE CONTINUING EXPENDITURES FOR PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED IN THE PAST BUT THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T. GIVEN KIND OF A MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT FOR THOSE TYPES OF EXPENDITURES. SO -- JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL AS A WHOLE -- MANY OF THE FUNDING PROPOSALS DON'T HAVE. A LOT OF INFORMATION ON KIND OF WHAT THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE FOR THOSE EXPENDITURE PROPOSALS SOME CASES JUST BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY PROJECTS -- THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS TO FUND -- AND AND A LOT OF CASES ESTIMATES AROUND WHAT THE EXPECTED EMISSION REDUCTIONS ARE SO SEE WHAT THOSE PROGRAMS AND SO WE ENCOURAGE AND RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTING MINISTRATION TO REPORT ON WHAT X. EXPECTS. FOR THOSE PROGRAMS BOTH TO GET A SENSE OF HOW TO PRIORITIZE YOUR FUNDING DECISIONS AS WELL AS A WHOLE THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FOR WHAT -- WHAT ACTUALLY? HAPPENS IN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS -- THE SECOND POINT IS -- FOR SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THERE WILL LIKELY BE NEED TO BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS UNDER THE PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNT SO FOR EXAMPLE -- CARBS CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT OF THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT PROGRAM WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH AN ACTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS TAKEN -- FOR THAT PROGRAM -- THERE HAD BEEN SOME RECENT PROJECTIONS AND WHAT THE DEMAND FOR THAT PROGRAM WILL BE AND IT HAS SEEN IT. I THINK CARP RIGHT NOW IS PROJECTED THAT IT WILL FAR EXCEED THE TO ON DEMAND UNDER KIND OF THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM WILL FAR EXCEED THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND SO -- CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS YES SO SO -- I BELIEVE UNDER THEIR CURRENT PROJECTIONS -- IN THE BUDGET YEAR UNDER THE PROGRAM AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS THERE WERE -- DEMAND WOULD BE ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SOVIET DOUBLE WHAT THE PROPOSED AMOUNT IS AND SO THAT MEANS -- YET AND THERE WOULDN'T IN ORDER TO STAY WITHIN A BUDGET THEY WERE LIKE WE NEED TO BE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM WHETHER THAT BE -- YOU KNOW WHICH VEHICLES QUALIFY FOR REBATES THE AMOUNT OF THE REBATES -- INCOME LIMITS THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND SO -- WE RECOMMEND YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO KIND OF REPORT ON WHAT THEY'RE THINKING IS AROUND KIND OF WHAT THOSE TO TRUST THE JUDGMENTS ARE. AND WHETHER THOSE TYPES ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH WITH WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE ABOUT THIS THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM -- AND THEN FINALLY JUST. MORE GENERALLY AS ALWAYS -- I THINK YOU KNOW THE G. JARA PACKAGE AS A MATTER OF HOW THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES DIFFERENT GOALS AND DIFFERENT. ACTIVITIES -- WHETHER THAT BE GREENHOUSE GASES -- REDUCTIONS AND LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS FIND AN ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS YOU HAVE A A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FOCUS IN THOSE AREAS AND SO A LOT OF THESE DECISIONS AROUND AROUND YOUR PRIORITIES. I DO WANT TO NOTE -- ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE -- I'LL JUST KIND OF RE EMPHASIZE SOME OF OUR EARLIER COMMENTS AROUND YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY AND WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT. HOW THE SPENDING FITS AND TO KIND OF THE OVERALL CLIMATE STRATEGY THAT THE STATE HAS HOW IT FITS IN WITH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND THINKING ABOUT HOW HOW THINGS INTERACTION? AND WHERE SPENDING CAN KIND OF DO ADDITIONAL YOUR CONCURRED ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS WERE OTHER POLICIES AREN'T ENCOURAGING THOUGH SO THINGS LIKE SPENDING ON THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE THE CAP SECTOR IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM -- ENCOURAGING ME OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. AND ONE LAST THING I'LL EMPHASIZE. AS WELL IS -- YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. AGAIN CALIFORNIA'S PLACE AND GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CALIFORNIA'S ROUGHLY 1% OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- TRYING TO THINK STRATEGICALLY. AROUND. HOW THE STATE CAN DO THE MOST TO ENCOURAGE A MEASURE OF OPTIONS HERE AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND SO WHAT TYPES OF POLICIES ARE MOST LIKELY TO DO THAT WHETHER THAT'S? YOU KNOW -- DEMONSTRATING THE POLICY CAN BE ADOPTED HERE AYE AYE AS WELL AS AND AND AND KIND OF ENCOURAGE OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO ADOPT A SIMILAR TYPE OF POLICY OR WHETHER THAT'S ENCOURAGING. TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION TO PROMOTE TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN THEN BE ADOPTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS NOW LOOK AT IN THIS FUNDING BUT WE THINK THAT'S ONE IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND PARTICULARLY FROM A GREENHOUSE GAS PERSPECTIVE SO. WELL IN MY COMMENTS AND THANK YOU. BARBARA PLANTS WELCOME. GOOD MORNING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JULIANA MORE IZUMI. AND THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE CAP AND TRADE THE NEXT TWENTY NINETEEN CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN -- THE LA DID THE LA -- DID A GOOD JOB OF OF GIVING AN OVERALL -- IT IS CONSISTENT WITH NOT JUST AB FOR THIRTY TWO BUT ALSO EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT AND THE INTENTIONS BEHIND THAT. THE THE PLAN DOES. CONTINUE TO FUND CORE PROGRAMS. AND WE WILL BE AS FAR AS REVENUES GOES WE WILL BE GOING BACK THROUGH THE MAY PROCESS. I THINK TYPICALLY WE'VE DONE THIS IS WE GO BACK AND REEVALUATE THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS. AND GIVEN THAT THE FEBRUARY AUCTION CAME IN MUCH HIGHER THAN. THAN ORIGINAL -- ESTIMATES WE WILL BE RE WORKING ALL OF THAT SO. MORE TO COME -- THE PLAN DOES. DOES CENTER ON PROVIDING THE THIS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AMOUNTS PER. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY HAND SB. FIVE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN AS FAR AS OUTCOMES AND HOW THINGS ARE ARE ALLOCATED THE ADMINISTRATION ALLOCATES BASED ON A MULTIPLE -- VIEW POINT IF YOU WILL. SO GLOBAL. GLOBALLY WITHIN CALIFORNIA THE THE TOP -- THE TOP. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE WORD -- BUT THE INVESTMENT THE BEST BANG FOR BOX ON AND WE ARE FUNDING A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LOW CARBON -- TRANSPORTATION FIELD THOSE WERE GETTING QUITE A BIT OF GHG REDUCTIONS. THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES -- ONE THING AS FAR AS ACCOUNTABILITY AND OUTCOME BUT THIS WAS JUST RELEASED LAST. WEEK SO IT'S THE ANNUAL REPORT -- THAT. BASICALLY IT ELIMINATES WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IT ALSO RECAPS WHAT'S BEEN DONE. OVER. THROUGH THE LIFE OF IT UP TO THIS UP TO DATE [inaudible] SO. THE CAP I'M SORRY. THIS REPORT. WHICH IS -- PURSUANT TO AB. FIFTEEN THIRTY TWO PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK OF TRANSPARENCY. AND PROVIDES IT'S A REPORT ON THE AUCTION PROCEEDS AND THE PROJECTS AT ITS FUNDING. JUST TO GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL. AS OF NOVEMBER THIRTIETH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROPRIATED NINE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR PROJECTS THAT FACILITATE GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. AND SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF OTHER STATE PRIORITIES INCLUDING LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION WILDFIRE PREVENTION. JOBS COMMUNITY YEAR PROTECTION AND CLIMATE RESILIENCY. OF THE NINE POINT THREE BILLION ADMINISTERING AGENCIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED THREE POINT FOUR BILLION. IN PROJECTS TO CARRY OUT AN ESTIMATED THIRTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE HELPING PRIORITY POPULATIONS WHICH INCLUDE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. TO DATE 57% OF THE IMPLEMENTED FUNDING HAS BENEFITED PRIORITY POPULATIONS WITH 36% OF IMPLEMENTED FUNDING LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE REPORT ALSO DESCRIBES HOW THE INVESTMENTS HAVE MET AND EXCEEDED THE INVESTMENT MINIMUM SET FORTH IN AB FIFTEEN FIFTY AN SB. FIVE THIRTY FIVE JUST TO GIVE YOU A FEW STATISTICS ON SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE. A HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN MILLION APPROPRIATED FOR AGRICULTURAL REPLACEMENTS. OF THAT SIXTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION HAS BEEN AWARDED THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. AND THE EXPECTED BENEFITS ARE ALMOST TEN THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF GHG EMISSIONS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION POUNDS OF KNOX REDUCTIONS OVER NINETY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS OF DIRECT DIESEL PM TWO POINT FIVE REDUCTIONS. AND ALMOST A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND GALLONS OF FUEL REDUCTIONS. 73% OF THE FUNDS WERE IN DISADVANTAGED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS. IN THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM OF THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION ALLOCATED. ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN FROM THAT SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF GHG EMISSIONS HAVE RESULTED TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION GALLONS IN FUEL REDUCTIONS. AND AN EXPECTED NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION POUNDS OF KNOX REDUCTIONS. AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF DIESEL IN PARTICULAR MATTER REDUCTIONS. SO AS FAR AS OUTCOMES WE CAN SEE FROM SOME OF THE STATISTICS. WHAT PROGRAMS ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL AT REDUCING GHG AND THEN WE GET SOME OF THE CO BENEFITS OF THE REDUCE PARTICULATE MATTERS? SO THE THE ANNUAL REPORT ALSO INCLUDES SOME STATISTICS ON THE CO BENEFITS THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE G. H. T. -- FROM THE WHOLE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM NOT JUST GHG REDUCTIONS BUT BUT ADDRESSING A LOT OF THE AIR POLLUTION. AND CLIMATE RESILIENCY ISSUES -- THE PLAN DOES INCLUDE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION. FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO DO A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND THAT'LL GO WILL DOUBLE INTO THAT MORE IN SUB. FOR BUT THAT THAT -- PIECE OF THIS PLAN IS JUST CONSISTENT WITH EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT WHICH WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED. A QUALIFIED. EXCUSE ME AND SKILLED WORKFORCE. IN ABLE TO TO IN ORDER -- TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH TOWARDS A NEW LOW LOW CARBON ECONOMY. AND WITH THAT. ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO -- WELL PUT TO THAT AND THAT OUR ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST -- EIGHT ONE CAN HARDLY -- LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATION'S SICK A PROPOSED EXPENDITURE PLAN AND MISS THE FACT THAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST -- THERE ARE I DON'T KNOW -- TEN TWELVE CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT FUNDED -- TO NOT NOT PROPOSED FOR FUNDING THAT WERE FUNDED AND THE LAST CYCLE -- AND I'M WONDERING WHY THAT IS. FOR SOME OF THEM. THEY HAVE ALTERNATE FUNDING SOURCES SO SOME OF THEM ARE FUNDED WITH -- PROP SIXTY EIGHT MONEY FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES. AGENCIES FUNDING WILL BE BACK FILLED USING THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT MONEY SO IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION THAT PROP SIXTY EIGHT WAS -- OF THAT THE VOTERS VOTED ON PROP SIXTY EIGHT TO SUPPLANT -- WHAT WE WERE ALREADY DOING NOT WHATSOEVER VETERANS -- EVER WE ALSO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF KERRY OVER IN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. SO THEY'VE GOT PREVIOUS YEARS THAT THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET OUT THE DOOR. WELL THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT -- AND I WOULD APPRECIATE SEEING AN ANALYSIS OF THAT -- BUT I'D I THINK YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT VOTERS EXPECTED TO SUPPLEMENT WHAT WE ARE ALREADY DOING THEY WANTED MORE OF THE SAME. NOT -- JUST -- SHIFT OVER THE WAIVER ACCOUNTING CUTS FOR EXISTING EXPENDITURES OTHERWISE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVATION FOR VOTING -- AFTER THE MEASURE WOULD HAVE BEEN -- SO I I FRANKLY THINK WE NEED TO REALLY -- RETHINK THAT PART OF THE PROPOSAL HERE THERE'S SOME AREAS HERE THAT ARE -- A VERY EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS -- LIKE URBAN GREENING URBAN FORESTRY THE WETLAND RESTORATION -- AND THEN AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE LIST -- THERE'S TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- AND IT YOU MENTIONED I THINK RIGHTLY -- A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT WITHOUT THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN COMMUNITIES THAT CAN'T AFFORD -- TO HAVE THE FOLKS ON BOARD WHO DO THAT. TO A TECHNICAL WORK ON STAFF THIS IS A CRITICAL MONEY WHAT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S. THINKING ON ELIMINATION OF THAT FUNDING. WE'VE GOT. A LOT OF PARTS THAT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL IS PULLING FROM THEY'VE GOT -- THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES AND THEY CAN USE A PORTION OF THAT. AS WELL FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE LOCALS. WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL ASSISTANCE JUST JUST. TO WRAP IT ALL IN TOGETHER THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING ON TO HELP THE LOCALS. FOR EXAMPLE THE AB. SIX SEVENTEEN IS REALLY FOCUSING ON LOCAL AND REGIONAL NEEDS. AND WORKING WITH AND DEVELOPING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS SPECIFICALLY WITH IN THESE. REGIONS TO GIVE THE LOCALS AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE. THE THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN HAS TARGETED. THE THE HIGHEST RISK AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WERE TARGETING THOSE WELL SO IF THERE ARE IS SUFFICIENT FUNDING FROM OTHER SOURCES -- I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE FOR THE COMMITTEE TO SEE AN ANALYSIS THAT SHOWS WHERE THAT MONEY'S COMING FROM OF WHAT THE DEMAND IS AND HOW THAT DEMAND IS -- IS ADEQUATELY OF BEING BEING THAT I WAS QUITE SURPRISED TO SEE THIS -- A COMPLETELY THIS ITEM COMPLETELY DE FUNDED -- WHY DON'T WE TAKE ROLE SO THAT WITH STATUS QUORUM JUST IN CASE SOMEBODY NEEDS? TO TAKE OFF AND THEN WILL -- CONTINUE WITH QUESTIONS OF THE LOOKS LIKE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS [inaudible] HELLO. HERE FONG GARCIA MULLIN PATTERSON [inaudible] PRESS. THAT WE HERE. TO REVERSE. ALL RIGHT SO WERE -- WERE COMPLETE HOME -- FOR QUESTIONS -- MS RADIUS MISTER PATTERSON IS REVERSE. I I WANTED TO JOIN WITH THE CHAIRS IN HIS CONCERN. SPECIFICALLY ON THE TAKING AWAY OF URBAN GREENING FUNDING. AND VERY SPECIFICALLY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE CHAIR IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. OFTENTIMES WHEN WE SAY WE HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. COME TAKE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE LOTS OF COMMUNITIES TO HAVE GREAT EXPERIENCE AND THEY'VE INVESTED. IN GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR PROPOSALS WITH PUTTING TOGETHER A WINNING GRANTS. BUT SOME OF THE MOST TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AS THE CHAIR HAS INDICATED. AND THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. IN ORDER MY COMMUNITY AYE AYE I'M VERY BLESSED AND VERY HAPPY THAT WE ARE ONE OF THE RECEPTIONS RECIPIENTS OF THE AB. SIX SEVENTEEN WE ARE THAT DISADVANTAGED. AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THAT. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AYE AYE AYE AYE TO LOOK FORWARD. TO GETTING SOME FURTHER CLARIFICATION AS TO WHERE. THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO GET THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- IF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE FROM -- FROM STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON THANK YOU. A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF AREAS. SO IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT A COUPLE OF SIGNIFICANT BUDGET CUT AREAS AND VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS. THAT ARE DOING A TERRIFIC JOB THE DERRY METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAM -- BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S OWN ANALYSIS. SAYS IT IS PROVING THE GREATEST GHG REDUCTION OF ALL FUNDED PROGRAMS. AND THAT IS THE SECOND MOST COST EFFECTIVE AT EIGHT TO NINE DOLLARS PER TON [inaudible] A REDUCTION. WHY THEN IS THIS PROGRAM GOING TO SEE THESE MASSIVE CUTS? SO AGAIN THE ADMINISTRATION HAD GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE CORE PROGRAMS. THERE'S STILL RE APPROPRIATED FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THE METHANE FROM PRIOR YEARS THAT HASN'T GONE OUT YET. SO. TO JUST KEEP PUTTING IN. ADDITIONAL FUNDING. DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE IF IT'S NOT GONNA GET OUT THE DOOR RIGHT AWAY. SO THIS IS JUST A REGENERATING. OF SOME OF WHAT. PROGRAMS ARE CONTINUING TO GET OUT THE DOOR AND WE CAN ALWAYS REVISIT. IN ANOTHER PLAN SO IF. YOU'RE WILLING. TO IF THE FUNDS ARE NOT FULLY SUBSCRIBE. TO AND THEY GET FULLY SUBSCRIBED IN SIX MONTHS NINE MONTHS INTO A BUDGET YEAR. ARE YOU TELLING US THAT. WE CAN GO BACK AND AND WE VISIT. THESE HUGE CUTS IN A FUTURE YEAR NOT IN NOT IN THE CURRENT YEAR. BUT THAT'S NOT SATISFACTORY TO ME AND TO THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. SIMILARLY THE FARMER PROGRAMS FUNDED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED PROJECTS TO REDUCE GHG AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY. ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. CARP HAS IDENTIFIED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS THE NECESSARY AMOUNT TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING THIS PROGRAM. AGAIN IF YOU CARE ABOUT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. AND IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS MUCH AS THE MINISTRATION SAYS IT DOES. WHY IS THE FORMER BUDGET BEING CUT TO JUST TWENTY FIVE MILLION? THERE ARE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES FOR THE AGRICULTURAL REPLACEMENTS AND THE HEAVY DUTY. WE'VE GOT OTHER INVESTMENTS THE FARMER PROGRAM IS NOT JUST SUPPORTED BY -- THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. BUT I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE CARL MOYER LSO CAN GO TOWARDS THIS. THIS IS A HUGE CUT FROM LAST YEAR [inaudible] WHAT'S CHANGED. IN BOTH OF THESE INSTANCES WHAT'S CHANGED. WHY THE SLASH WELL? THIS IS ALWAYS A ONE TIME ALLOCATION EACH YEAR WITH THE THE VINTAGE ALLOWANCES. PRETTY MUCH BEING SOLD OUT NOW SO WE'VE SOLD ALL OF THE VINTAGE. UP TO THIS POINT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. AND THAT'S WHY OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS ARE ALSO. VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PROJECTING ADDITIONAL VINTAGE ALLOWANCES SO AS HE ALLOWED INTO THE LOANS. IT'S FROM PREVIOUS YEARS THAT WERE THAT WENT UNSOLD. YOU TALK ABOUT THAT DID THE DID THE IN THE OUTRAGE THE CAP AND ROCKS RIGHT IN THE AUCTIONS SO THE THE THE AUCTION PROCEEDS. WILL BE NOT NEARLY AS HIGH AS WHAT WE SAW IN SAY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY SEVENTEEN THOSE WERE THOSE WERE HUGE AMOUNTS AND WE HAVE LARGE BALANCES AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT MOVING FORWARD -- THE L. A. O. IS NOT HERE. HELLO I'M SORRY. THE ADVISABLE MISTER BROWN I THOUGHT YOU NORMALLY I THINK IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S THE LA OC. ARE WE DOES NOT THE LA -- PREDICT GREATER. CAP AND CAP AND TRADE MONEY. THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING. YES SO OUR PROJECTIONS ARE OVER THE CURRENT YEAR AND OVER THE BUDGET YEAR THAT REVENUE WILL BE ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS PROJECTING NOW SOME OF THAT MONEY IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO CERTAIN YES A TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS. BUT YOU KNOW ONCE THAT MONEY IT IS KIND OF ALLOCATED TO THOSE PROGRAMS AND THERE WOULD BE NO ROUGHLY AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO BE SPENT SOME OF THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO BE LEFT IN RESERVE TO BUDGET FRONT CERTAINTY BUT ONE EXAMPLE WE LAID OUT. IS YOU KNOW WITH UNDER OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS IF THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATED A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE THERE WOULD STILL BE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LEFT IN THE FUND AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND WE THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A REASONABLE FUND BALANCE. FOR THE PREDICATE ON YOUR CUTS. IS THAT YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING -- SUBSTANTIAL. STABILITY I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY IN THE AUCTIONS. AND YET WE NOW THAT WE HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SAYING THAT. WE WE CAN TEST THAT. THAT POINT OF VIEW. MY ONLY POINT IS. THESE ARE HUGE DRAMATIC CUTS. AND IF IT'S PREDICATED ON CAUTION. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW HERE WITH RESPECT TO THE LEDGE OFFICE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD THAT THAT THE WI YOU'RE CUTTING THE VERY PROGRAMS. IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. DISADVANTAGED AREAS IN THESE TWO PROGRAMS THAT HAVE A HUGE PERFORMANCE HISTORY IN DOING PRECISELY WHAT. STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYS WE WANT TO DO AND I FIND THAT VERY DIFFICULT TO SWALLOW. NOTED I IT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT TOO WITH SOME OF THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING. THE WE'VE ALREADY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF ALREADY. COMMITTED SOME OF IT TO ONGOING FUNDING. FOR EXAMPLE THE CVR P. THE THE VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM AND THE SP NINE A ONE FOR THE FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. SO THAT'S AS WE START DOING THOSE ON GOING YEAR AFTER YEAR COMMITMENTS IT'S GOING TO SQUEEZE OUT SOME OF THE OTHER -- DISCRETIONARY FUNDING AND AS I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER AND I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU WERE IN THE ROOM WHEN WHEN WE FIRST STARTED. BUT THAT. WE ALWAYS GO BACK THE ADMINISTRATION ALWAYS REVIEWS REVENUES AGAIN AT MAY REVISE. AND YES WE HAVE DEFERRED AND AND WITH THE LA -- THE LA -- AND THE ADMINISTRATION WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS AND WE KNOW WHERE THE DIFFERENCES ARE. AND MOST OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE CORRECT THE ONLY REAL BIG DIFFERENCE IS THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT WILL BE OPTION. SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I'VE. I SHOULD BE LOOKING TO A MAY REVISE FOR RECALCULATION IN CONSIDERATION ON THESE TWO PROGRAMS. WE WILL BE COMING BACK OUT WITH A NAY REVISED PROPOSAL. AND WILK WOULD IT BE INCLUSIVE OF THE TWO PROGRAMS I'VE JUST SUGGESTED. IT'S STILL UNDER DISCUSSION. WELL AGAIN I JUST WANT. TO POINT OUT THESE ARE TWO EXCEEDINGLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS AND THEY ARE UNDERGOING HUGE CUTSI FIND IT DIFFICULT -- TO JUSTIFY THAT THANK YOU. MS RIVER S. FOLDER MISTER FONG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I'D LIKE TO TALK I MEAN I SURE CONCERNS SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BROUGHT UP OF THE PROGRAMS. ON THEIR NOT BEING FUNDED -- ONE SPECIFICALLY URBAN GREEN AND THEN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- YOU MENTION THAT IRVING GREEN YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WAS FUNDED AT TWENTY MILLION. AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT'S MOVING OVER TO PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S BEING FUNDED AT THE SAME LEVEL WITHIN THE PROP [inaudible] SIX EIGHT A LOCATION. I WOULD I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO ON THOSE NUMBERS OKAY THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW. AND THEN AS FAR AS PRIORITIZING SPENDING YOU KNOW TO REACH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW I REMEMBER THAT REPRESENTS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY -- AND YOU KNOW AS A CONCERNS -- I HAVE CONCERNS HOW GGF FUNDING IS BEING SPENT TO REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES. OF YOU KNOW OF THESE COMMITTEES HAVE THE LEAST EFFICIENT BUILDINGS AND HIGHEST EMITTING VEHICLES WHICH MAKES THEM THE MOST COST EFFICIENT TARGETS FOR CLIMATE INVESTMENT -- AND I'M NOT ENTIRELY CONFIDENT THAT WERE FOOD FULLY UTILIZING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE AT THE GROUND LEVEL -- TO IDENTIFY -- THOSE INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE A CONVERSATION ON ON HOW WE CAN BETTER REACH THOSE. ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING IN THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES [inaudible] MR FUNG. WELL I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE -- I GUESS MY MY QUESTIONS ARE KIND OF MORE HOLISTIC AND IF WE COULD JUST STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT. CAN YOU AT FROM AT LEAST CAN A MINISTRATION I GUESS OUTLINE. THE FRAMEWORK OUR CRITERIA THAT THEY'RE USING TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS -- HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW YOU HOW YOU DECIDE THE AMOUNTS AND WHAT GOES INTO THESE DECISIONS. AGAIN SOME OF IT WAS IS LOOKING AT IT AGAIN HOLISTICALLY AND I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT UTILIZING SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AGAIN THAT ADDRESS THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND MEET THE GOALS THAT WE WANT THAT THE STATUTE HAS LAID FORTH. IN GETTING 35% OUT TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE LOW INCOME -- COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS SO THAT'S ONE LANDS. AND WE ALSO LOOK AT THE PROGRAMS THAT [inaudible] THAT SUPPORT. MOVING FORWARD AND BUILDING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. SUCH AS OUR TRANSPORTATION IS A HUGE. PORTION OF THIS. AND THEN HOUSING IS ALSO THAT'S PART OF THE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED. AS WELL AS A TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES. SO THE THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES AND LENSES THAT WE LOOK AT WHEN. TRYING TO CRAFT A PLAN. SO I GUESS AS A FOLLOW UP MY MY MY VIEW OR MAYBE THIS IS SUGGESTION IS OR MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME INPUT ON BUT IF THERE ARE THESE CRITERIA OR CERTAIN GOALS AT THAT. YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS THERE A LIST. OF GOALS AND ITEMS THAT. YOU COULD PROVIDE IN A IN A SIMPLE SIMPLE WAY WHERE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE CRITERIA FULLY TRANSPARENT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO SEE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THESE ARE THE STATUTE THAT WE HAVE TO DO. SO THAT WE WE ARE HAGGLING -- WE WILL WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA HAGGLE I GUESS FOR THE OVER THE AMOUNTS BUT I GUESS THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY THESE CUTS OR AUGMENTATIONS ARE HAPPENING. I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S THE THE VIEW THAT I SEE IS THAT -- THESE DECISIONS ARE VERY SPORADIC WE DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE CUTTING -- UP OF ONE PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY THAT IS VERY VERY COST EFFECTIVE AND THAT WE MAY BE FUNDING -- A PROGRAM THAT IS NOT SO COST EFFECTIVE AND AS IF COST EFFECTIVENESS IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA WHICH I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE IN TERMS OF THE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING GHGS. THAT SHOULD PROBABLY BE THE NO ONE PRIORITY AND IF WE'RE NOT. ABIDING BY THAT CRITERIA THAT EVERYONE AGREES SHOULD BE THE CRITERIA THEN MAYBE WE THROUGH VALUE WAY. OUR OUR SPENDING. THAT MAKES SENSE. SO IS THAT POSSIBLE IS IT WITH THE LA I'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT LIST OF OR WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE BE ABLE. TO PROVIDE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE MAY REVISE A HERE'S OUR EXPENDITURE PLAN AND HERE'S A CRITERIA THAT WE USE TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED PLAN. WE CAN PROBABLY WE WE CAN PROBABLY CRAFT SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD. WOULD ELIMINATE SOME OF OUR REASONING BEHIND THIS. BUT AGAIN THERE IS THERE IS THAT ONE COMPONENT THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THE ON GOING COMMITMENTS THAT WE'VE ALREADY MADE. THAT THAT I'M AWARE OF WE DIDN'T OTHER THAN THE WORK FORCE -- DEVELOPMENT. TRAINING AND THE EIGHTEEN MILLION ADDITIONAL FOR THE HEALTHY SOILS. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM INCREASED OVER CURRENT YEAR. AND TO MY LAST QUESTION MISTER MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE THE TIME IS IT. IS THERE UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE THAT THESE PROGRAMS -- ARE ALWAYS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE EVERY YEAR AND IT. IS IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NUMBERS CAN CUT BECAUSE OF MIKE MY FEAR IS THAT YOU YOU'RE. YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING ANY CERTAINTY TO THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REDUCE AN AND ABIDE BY THE THE STATUES SO YOU'RE ASKING. FOR EXAMPLE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY TO ACHIEVE THESE OALS AND THEN YOU OUTLINED THESE THESE FUNDING LEVELS AND THEY'RE PLANNING LONG TERM. TO TO TRY TO MEET THE GOALS SET FORTH BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROCESS YOU SAY I CHANGED MY MIND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THE FUNDING LEVELS THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING. AND THEN YOU'RE EXPECTING THE TO SAY THAT MY EXAMPLE THAT CULTURAL COMMUNITY TO STILL HIT THE GOALS. HI IT'S IT'S LIKE LUCY PULLING THE FOOTBALL AWAY AND SO. HOW DO YOU EXPECT? ANY INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO LONG TERM PLAN. TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT THE MINISTRATION AND PROBABLY THIS BODY WANTS TO ACHIEVE WITHOUT PROVIDING THEM WITH SOME CERTAINTY. ACKNOWLEDGING THE THE CHALLENGES WITH ONE TIME FUNDING. BUT THAT'S WHY WE THAT'S WHY THE ADMINISTRATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE CRAFTED SOME OF THE ON GOING COMMITMENTS WAS TO CARRY THAT THROUGH. NOW IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO PROPOSE. ON GOING IT JUST SQUEEZES OUT SOME OF THE OTHER ONE TIME SO IT IS A MATTER OF OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT. MIX AND PRIORITY SURE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE STATUTORY THAT 60% SO WE'RE LEFT WITH40% AND THEN ONCE WE'VE. OBLIGATED A PORTION OF THAT. AS AN ONGOING RESOURCE. THEN THERE'S THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN GO AROUND SO I UNDERSTAND HOW. THE THE CHALLENGES WITH WITH. THE GOALS THAT THE STATE HAS OVERALL IN ACHIEVING CLIMATE RESILIENCY GHG REDUCTIONS. AND HELPING THE DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSION ON CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AS ONE OF THE DAILY OF RESPONSE IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE A LIST OF CRITERIA THAT SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE. USED I I SEE THAT YOU'RE A RABBI REVIEW TO REPORT BUT AND IS IT IS IT IS THAT HELPFUL FROM A FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND IN TERMS OF EDUCATING THE PUBLIC AND EDUCATE AND LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF HOW THESE DECISIONS SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE MADE. YEAH I MEAN I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES TRYING TO TO KIND OF ESTIMATE WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH EACH PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND I THINK. ANY OF THE YOUR POINT IS THAT A GOOD ONE THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW WE WANT TO TRY AND GET INFORMATION ON KIND OF WHAT EACH ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS. IS ACHIEVING AND THEN SORT OF HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HOW THAN WERE SORT OF ALLOCATING FUNDS AND PRIORITIZING AMONGST THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS -- ANY WE DON'T HAVE A YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO KIND OF WHY THE ADMINISTRATION IS PRIORITIZING THINGS IN IN A PARTICULAR WAY BASED ON KIND OF INFORMATION WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. BUT CERTAINLY KIND OF TRYING TO OUTLINE FOR EACH PROGRAM WHAT TYPES OF BENEFITS ARE ARE YOU EXPECTING TO ACHIEVE AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE CAN THEN USE THAT. TO KIND OF YOU KNOW -- YOU PRIORITIZE AMONG THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BASED ON HOW IT PRIORITIZE IS DIFFERENT THINGS WHETHER THAT BE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS GREENHOUSE GASES CLIMATE ADAPTATION SO. DOES LA WILL HAVE A FREE MARKET THAT. CAN WORK OR DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE THE DATA. WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION -- I'M RIGHT ANALYSIS. I MEAN I I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES WE DON'T HAVE. OF A LOT OF INFORMATION ON KIND OF PROJECTED OUTCOMES FOR EACH ONE OF THESE POTS OF MONEY WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT KIND OF HOW THE MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT SO FAR AND SO WE CAN TRY TO KIND OF PULL INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE ON KIND OF HOW. THE MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT SO FAR AND WHAT IT HAS ACHIEVED BUT AS FAR AS KIND OF A PROJECTIONS GOING FORWARD FOR EACH PROGRAM I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BE KIND OF GAPS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED ON IN THE KIND OF CURRENT PROPOSALS THAT INFORMATION. ISN'T AVAILABLE BUT WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO KIND OF YOU WORK WITH YOU AND OUR STAFF TO TRY TO PULL WHATEVER WE CAN'T AVAILABLE THANK YOU OFFICIAL TEMAS GERMAN THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT MAYBE WE HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US. MS RESTED YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION. ARE COMMON I DID TO CHAIR OF MY INITIAL COMMENTS WERE IN REACTION TO WHICH WOULD SEVEN HOW PORTENT THAT WAS -- ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES LETTER COULD CONTINUING WITH FUNDING -- THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT CONTINUOUSLY. IS A PRIORITY TO THE ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEAVY DUTY -- VEHICLES IN OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT. IT NOT ONLY ISN'T SEEN AS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT BUT IS ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO BE DECREASED. UNLIKE THE REST PATTERSON TALKED ABOUT THE WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR THIS DISPARITY -- MY MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PROGRAM SUCH AS HYBRIDS AND ZERO EMISSION TRUCK AND BUS VOUCHER PROGRAM. TO THIS POINT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. WELL AGAIN THE WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT THE TWO HUNDRED THAT'S THE ONGOING COMMITMENT AND THAT IS IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS FOR THE VOUCHER PROGRAM. FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE VOUCHER PROGRAM. AND THE HEAVY DUTY AGAIN IT WAS IT WAS A MATTER OF CRAFTING IT. SO IT SOME OF IT WAS PROPORTIONATE. IN WHAT WE HAD REMAINING. AS FAR AS AFTER WE'VE TAKEN OUT THE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED AFTER WE'VE TAKEN OUT OFF THE TOP AND THE ON GOING COMMITMENTS. I WANT IT I'M SORRY I AM SORRY GO HEAD NO NO PLEASE STE. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL. ON THE ONES THAT WERE FUNDED FOR HEAVY DUTY [inaudible] AND THE AND THE OTHER TRANSPORTATION WITH THAT IS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF THE G. H. G. AND THE AIR POLLUTANTS. CONTRIBUTING TO TO HIGH AIR POLLUTANTS IS IN THE TRANSPORTATION FIELD. SO IN ORDER TO GET THOSE NUMBERS DOWN IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO DO SOME INVESTMENT SENATE. BUT IF WE WERE TO SAY INCREASE THE HEAVY DUTY BACK UP. TO THE ONE EIGHTY THAT IN CURRENT YEAR THEN WE WOULD NEED TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO CUT ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S I'M SORRY THERE IS THAT THAT BALANCE BUT IF THE LAR LET LA WAS CORRECT IN THAT THE THE ADJUSTMENTS DO HAVE TO BE MADE AND ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION COULD BE SPENT. AS WAS ANNOUNCED EARLIER. ONCE THE BUDGET IS DONE IS DONE -- WE CAN SPEND MORE BECAUSE THE THE THE MORE ACCURATE -- ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE OR WITH THE LA -- HAS SENT. THEN WE DO HAVE THAT MONEY TO OUT HERE OR DO WE NOT. THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL ESTIMATED PROJECTIONS WE ARE COMING BACK IN IN THE MAY REVISE WITH UPDATED REVENUE PROJECTIONS. AND THAT WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE OF THE ESTIMATED REVENUE THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THE LA L. NO THAT WOULD BE BASED ON ON THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAD WITH THE THE LATEST FEBRUARY AUCTION IN THAT CAME IN MUCH HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED FOR CURRENT YEAR. SO WE KNOW WERE WERE PROJECTING ADDITIONAL IN CURRENT YEAR. AND THEN THAT WILL AFFECT WHAT'S IN BUDGET YEAR. WONDERFUL. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY. AB -- FIFTY FIFTY A 25%. INVESTMENT WAS WAS -- RECOMMENDED I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. WHICH OF THE IT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO. WHICH OF THE PROGRAMS ARE FULFILLING THAT 25% WHICH OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. I CAN GET I CAN GET A CHART TO YOUR P. WHEN YOU'RE SAYING. THANK YOU -- AND THEN FINALLY IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR -- THIS YEAR I I AUTHORED. AB FOURTEEN ELEVEN WHICH SETS A GOAL TO DEPLOY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY -- VEHICLES -- AND ALSO INCLUDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THEM. AT THE BILL HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS ESPECIALLY THE FREIGHT CORRIDORS. TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL CLEAN AIR QUALITY IN SOME OF THE MOST BURDENS COMMUNITIES. OF IT SEEMS THAT WOULDN'T WOULDN'T WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION FUND'S ALLOCATION THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS BACK AND FORTH ON THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM. AND I THINK THERE WAS A COMMENT ABOUT THIS -- LOOKING TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE. GREENHOUSE GASES BUT ALSO PROTECTING THOSE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- ENSURING CLIMATE EQUITY. FOR COMMUNITIES JUSTICE OF MIGHT MY COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT. THE COMMITTEES ARE MOST AFFECTED ARE THE POOREST AND THEY DO HAVE THE WORST AIR. AND THAT IS WHY THAT 25% IS SO IMPORTANT. TO US. I I THINK THAT WE CAN DO BOTH AND FOR ME IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE SEE HOW WE FIND THAT THAT BALANCE SO THAT THE POOREST AND THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. ARE ALWAYS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. AND PROVIDED THE FUNDING THAT'S NEEDED -- WE KNOW THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS COMING ESPECIALLY. IT COMES TO ALL COMMUNITIES BUT THE POOREST ARE THE ONES THAT SUFFER THE MOST -- AND WE ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE POLLUTED. BECAUSE AND THEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER DIFFERENT COURT CORRIDOR. I I AM JUST ASKING THAT AS WE LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS AS WE EVALUATE. THOSE THAT DO BENEFIT THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. NOT TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK FIRST. AN ABSOLUTELY AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN HOW THE PLAN WAS CRAFTED. SO WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO TARGET THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS THE REPORT. THAT I HAD I HAD MENTIONED -- THAT'S OUT. IT WE HAVE MET THOSE GOALS WHICH I'M VERY PROUD OF THE STATE FOR DOING AND AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ALLOCATIONS [inaudible] THAT WERE. MORE PROJECTED AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THESE WILL CONTINUE THAT. I WOULD AND I KNOW IT'LL BE -- WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER BUT MAKING SURE THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THE WE ALSO HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE DON'T WANT STRANDED ASSETS I RECOGNIZE THAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO PUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN IF WE WANT TO THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO THEN INVEST. IN THAT THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND FOR THE TRUCKS COMING THROUGH THE THE THE FREIGHT CORRIDOR IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT AS THEY TRANSITION. AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE FREIGHT CORRIDOR WITHOUT LEAVING ALL OF THEIR DIESEL IN OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS -- MR TO SORRY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A COUPLE AND QUITE WELCOME. TO SUB THREE THIS MAKE YOU THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE YOUR DAY. I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON MISTER ON PATTERSON AND MISTER FONG COMMENTS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH. YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS -- QUITE A BALANCE IN EACH OF THOSE -- COMMITMENTS THAT WAS LEFT ON SPENT HOW MUCH WAS LEFT ON SPENT% I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND VERIFY BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME. WHAT WE DO WE DO THE STATE WIDE COORDINATION WE DON'T GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY? BUT I DO HAVE A LIST OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT RE APPROPRIATIONS AND WHAT HAVE TO ACTUALLY PULL A REPORT FROM THE SYSTEM TO SEE HOW MUCH. HOW MANY DOLLARS ARE ACTUALLY THERE AND I CAN GET THAT BACK? GREAT AND AS AS AS A FOLLOW UP ALSO IN THOSE TWO SECTORS OF YOUR TALK ABOUT THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN AB. SIX SEVENTEEN GIVE A SPECIFIC CAN YOU SHARE SOME EXAMPLES OF TYPES OF PROJECTS YOU FUND. I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO ARB FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS. GOOD MORNING JACKIE TESKE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD -- WITH REGARD -- TO EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE FIRST YEAR DESIGN THAT PROGRAM TO BE VERY MUCH -- CARL MOYER LIKE SO A LOT OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE SAW IN THE FIRST YEAR -- ARE ORIENTED A LITTLE MORE -- CARL MOYER -- BACKUP PROJECTS SO YOU SAW A TRUCK TO TRUCK REPLACEMENT PROJECTS YOU SAW SOME -- FARMER -- A GROUP -- TRACTOR REPLACEMENTS -- YOU SAW SCHOOL BUSES THE OVER THE LAST YEAR THEY'VE -- GUIDED A LOT MORE TOWARDS THAT COMMUNITY DEVELOPING GETTING THAT COMMUNITY INPUT SO YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE A LITTLE MORE ZERO EMISSION SOME BUSES -- DELIVERY VEHICLES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- BUT A BROAD SPECTRUM DEPENDING ON THE DISTRICT AND AND THE OTHER PROGRAM WAS. JUST THE THE DOOR TALKING BY ADD PROGRAMS WHEN I WALKED AND SO SOME OF THE BUT IN THE END WITH REGARD TO THE AG PROGRAM THE FARMER PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE SET UP AGAIN STARTED VERY MUCH CARL MOYER LIKE. BUT WE'VE EXPANDED THE PROGRAM BEYOND THAT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS THE PREPONDERANCE OF THAT AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN -- EXPANDED INTO MORROW WHEN YOU SAY CALL MORE LIKELY YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT I'M SORRY -- THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM IS -- INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WAS THE BASIS -- IT'S IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR TWENTY YEARS AND IT'S BEEN THE WITH THE START OF THE FOUNDATION FOR A NUMBER OF THESE OTHER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. SO WHEN -- THE LEGISLATURE -- ALLOCATED THAT MONEY THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT ALLOCATED AND SORT OF UNDER THAT FORMAT AND AND SO THE DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN USED TO THAT AND THAT'S HOW THEY THE PROCESS AND PROCEDURES THEY USED TO GET THAT FUNDING OUT. BUT IN THE FORMER PROGRAM THE AG WERE PROGRAM WE SEE A LOT OF TRACTOR REPLACEMENT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME -- ZERO MISSION -- AG U. T. V.'S -- AND SOME -- YOU KNOW AG PUMPS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT -- EQUIPMENT LIKE THAT TRUCK TO TRUCK REPLACEMENTS IN THE AG SECTOR BUT THE VAST MAJORITY IS AG TRACTOR REPLACEMENTS RIGHT. IN IN IN PART OF ANY INCENTIVE PROGRAM OF THIS IS TO TRY TO GET TO A TIPPING POINT WHERE THE INDUSTRY WHAT JUST NATURALLY MOVE THAT WAY HOW HOW FAR AWAY OR HOW CLOSE DO YOU THINK WE ARE TO THE WELL THAT DEPENDS ON THE THE CATEGORY WHEN WE'RE TALKING -- THE THE TRACTOR REPLACEMENT THAT'S A VERY CHALLENGING AREA TO BE I MEAN FUNDAMENTALLY -- AG INDUSTRY WILL RUN THESE VEHICLES UNTIL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO LIFE IN THEM AND THEN RUN THEM SOME MORE RIGHT. AND AND SO REALLY THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS THE WAY TO TO JUST DRIVE THAT REPLACEMENT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE -- IN THE CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING A MARKET FOR ZERO MISSION AND THOSE VEHICLES HAVE A LOWER COST OF DOING BUSINESS OVER THEIR LIFE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE -- THE BUSINESSES -- YOU PS FRITO LAY OTHERS GO AND SAY I I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A BUSINESS CASE FOR THIS AND SO WE DO SEE -- PATHWAY THERE FOR THOSE OF TAKING OFF ON THEIR OWN. IT IN IT'S IT'S IT'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION REGARDING FREIGHT AND AND PASSENGER VEHICLES WE WE KNOW THAT -- TRANSPORTATION. COVERS ABOUT 40% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHAT'S THE BREAKDOWN WITHIN THAT. 40% OF PASSENGER VEHICLES VERSUS RIGHT -- I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME AS PRIMARILY -- THOUGH -- IT'S DRIVEN MORE BY LIGHT DUTY BUT I WE CAN GET YOU THAT INFORMATION. DID YOU HAVE ANY BROUGHT. GAS. I'D I DON'T OKAY. MY MY MY LATEST -- START ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING. I THINK OF WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE TWENTY SIXTEEN NUMBERS ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- THAT -- HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES REPRESENTED ABOUT 22% OVERALL TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS AND 9% OF OVERALL EMISSIONS GOT AS HE IS EVEN IF YOU'RE IN. A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WHICH IS PRIMARILY DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY NEXT TO A FREEWAY -- ON AVERAGE -- USE GOING TO BE EVEN EVEN THE LEGISLATURE NEXT TO THE PORT OF LA OR THE OAKLAND PORT. CHANCES ARE YOU GONNA BE ROUGHLY -- SHARING THE SAME SIZE THE SAME KIND OF PERCENTAGE IS THAT IS THAT FAIR OR NOT FAIR. I I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DISTRICTS LOCALLY HOW THEY BREAK THAT DOWN WHEN THEY WELL I I THINK WHAT YOU'LL WHAT WE'VE FOUND -- VERY CLEARLY IF AND SO -- PARTICULATE MATTER FROM THE TRUCKS IS A HUGE CONSIDERATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- SO WE DO HAVE -- DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES REGIONALLY WE CARE A LOT ABOUT THE KNOX EMISSIONS ARE TO LEAD TO OZONE -- SO WE DO LOOK AT ALL OF THESE WHEN WE'RE DESIGNING OUR PROGRAMS. THIS IS SO YOU WOULD YOU WOULD LOOK AT SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. AND BASED ON THE POLLUTANTS YOU WOULD. DESIGN PROGRAMS DIFFERENTLY I'M SOLUTIONS ARE JUST TELL ME ARE AND WE WE CERTAINLY MIGHT WE MIGHT TARGET FOR EXAMPLE -- A AT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY OR ONE THAT'S VERY -- A COMMUNITY THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ROADWAY TRAFFIC TO CARE MORE ABOUT -- DRIVING THAT TO ZERO MISSION WE MIGHT DESIGN A MOBILITY PROGRAM VERY DIFFERENTLY WHICH HASDIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES A CAR SHARE PROGRAM MIGHT. MIGHT BE VERY -- DESIGN FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF COMMUNITY. THAT THE FOR SAY LIKE FREIGHT IN PARTICULAR YOU HAVE THE FREIGHT MAY IT MAY START AT A PARTICULAR PLACE BUT IT'S DRIVING ALL LET'S SAY ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE. WHERE THEY'RE GOING AND WHERE THEY'RE POLLUTING AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO WHEN WE HAVE OUR -- OUR REBATE PROGRAM IT IS A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE AND AND THAT WILL SERVE WHOEVER COMES IN THE DORM PROVIDED MISSION BENEFITS AS YOU SAY EVERYWHERE WHEN WE HAVE CERTAIN PILOT PROGRAMS WE MAY TARGET THOSE TO CERTAIN REGIONS LIKE THE PORTS OR OTHERS WHERE WE WANT. TO FOCUS -- AND AND GET ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN CERTAIN REGIONS -- BUT REGARDING THE THE BREAKDOWN FOR FUNDING FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES GIVE A SENSE OF REGIONALLY HOW IT BREAKS DOWN. WHETHER IT'S BETWEEN NORTH SOUTH INLAND. I THINK IT'S A BROADER QUESTION THERE BE. YEAH AND I I BELIEVE THAT THE THAT ON THE WEBSITE. FOR THE ANNUAL REPORT THERE ARE SOME MAPS AND IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL BECAUSE YOU CAN. YOU CAN SORT THE MAP BY REGION YOU CAN SORT OF BY DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT CRITERIA. AS FAR AS WHAT PROGRAMS WERE LOCATED IN IN WHAT. WHAT AREAS OF THE STATE SO SO WHAT ONE OF OUR ONGOING CONCERNS FROM THE FROM THE BAY AREA IS THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED MUSE HAVE BEEN PENALIZED? BY THE CALLIN VIRUS SCREEN AND AND THE CONCERN IS THAT -- BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE THE REGION HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AREA HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS THAT. MUCH OF THE WORK THAT OUR OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVE DONE IN PURSUIT AND FRANKLY OUR COMPANY TO PURSUE WOULD HAVE BEEN PENALIZED. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WERE AT RISK OF NOT GETTING -- ONGOING FUNDING OR NOT GETTING OUR FAIR SHARE MOVING FORWARD. YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME KIND OF PUZZLED LIKE FORTUNATELY FOR THIS NO I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE ONCE. AT THE STATE LEVEL WE PROVIDE THE FUNDING IN BULK AND THEN WE DON'T GET DOWN INTO THE GRANULAR AS FAR AS WHICH ONES AND I WOULD HAVE TO DO AGAIN 242- THEIR BOARD AS FAR AS WELL THIS IS THIS IS BUDGET COMMITTEE SO WE DO ASK INTO GRANULAR THINGS. WHAT? SO -- PERHAPS YOU COULD -- FOLLOW UP AND WE COULD HAVE A RIGHT SEPARATE. DISCUSSION SO I WOULD REALLY URGE YOU -- WHEN YOU COME NEXT TIME TO BE? PREPARED. TO OUST ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS IT'S IT'S DOUBTS CONCERNING THAT THE TO COME TO COMMITTEE IN A BILL TO ANSWER SOME OF THE BASIC FINANCIAL QUESTIONS [inaudible] OKAY.

SIXTY EIGHT AND I'M GONNA ASK STAFF TO ACTUALLY SET THAT AS AN AGENDA ITEM IN AN UPCOMING HEARING -- SO THAT WE CAN -- HAVE A FULL EXPLORATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION AS ON THAT I THINK IT'S OF A BUT MOST IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA VOTERS -- THAT THEY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE VOTING ON A FOR A A REVENUE PRODUCING MEASURE THAT -- OF THE MONEY'S GOING TO BE USED IN A WAY THAT -- THEY EXPECTED -- TO SO I LOOK FOR TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AT A AT A FUTURE MEETING.

I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THE A POLICY COMMITTEES ARE CONSIDERING THE FINDINGS WE BOTH BELIEVE THAT. THE THAT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE IS ON THE WAY -- TO CONSIDER -- WORK WERE -- THE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OTHER REPORT I WE DO WE JUST WANNA MAKE A QUICK NOTE THAT -- WE BELIEVE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED AND RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS WE BELIEVE ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND KNOCKS PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSED ON LONG TERM. MOSTLY PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THE ONLY WERE LA OR REPORTED REFER DID FIND THAT -- SEVEN CENTERS OF THE MOST COSTLY AND LEAST EFFECTIVE I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE THE H. FIT PROGRAM BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS ALLOCATED BY AIR BE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. INITIATIVE AT A FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR VOUCHER AMOUNT -- FUNDED A FORTUNE FIFTY LOW KNOCKS VEHICLES THE VOUCHER AMOUNT WAS SO LOW AT FORTY THOUSAND THE ONLY SIXTY NINE VEHICLES WERE FUNDED SO WE DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS LOW KNOCKS ARE IS A SHORT TERM -- SOLUTION TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND KNOCKS WE BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE WELL SERVED -- TO CONTINUED EXPLORING OTHER DETAILS OF THE PROJECTS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL ON THOUGH HERE ON BEHALF OF MY MOM DEFENSE FUND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TWO THINGS ONE IS -- THE CONTINUE PUSH -- FROM MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE A BICAMERAL LETTER -- ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR INVESTMENTS IN NATURAL LOOKING LANDS WHICH COULD ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT SECTORS INCLUDING WETLANDS INVESTMENTS -- FOREST HEALTH INVESTMENTS URBAN FORESTRY NORMAN GREENING -- HEALTHY SOILS ISSUES AND AND A NUMBER OF OTHER CATEGORIES -- AND SECOND ONE OF THE ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE CHAIR ABOUT. THE INTENT AROUND PROP SIXTY EIGHT NOT SUPPLANTING -- INVESTMENTS IN IN THESE AREAS IS IS VERY CLEAR TO US AS FOLKS THAT WORKED ON CRAFTING. THE THE THE BOND LANGUAGE AS WELL AS FOLKS THAT HELPED TO ADVOCATE FOR ITS PASSIONS WITH WITH THE ELECTORATE -- IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE ELECTORATE MEANT FOR THIS TO BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THESE THESE TYPES OF TYPES OF INVESTMENTS AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE -- SUPPLANTING ARGUMENT THAT THAT'S OAK WE'VE ALREADY HEARD BEING MADE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION -- WITH REGARDS TO HOW THE BUDGET IS GONNA BE ALLOCATING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS -- ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- MISTER BROWN WITH HELIO HAS BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB OF ALWAYS ARTICULATING HOW MUCH REVENUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES A YEAR AFTER. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING VERY CLEAR AND CONCISE I'M IN PROVIDING THOSE THOSE DETAILS THAT OFTEN I GET LEFT OUT -- WHEN WE SEE IT -- REPORTED OTHERWISE THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS JULIE JOURNAL WITH THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS FOR THEIR COMMENTS ON THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS URBAN GREETING PROGRAM -- WHICH ARE VERY IN FRONT OF THE COMMUNITIES WE WORK WITH WHICH ARE LOW INCOME DISPENSED COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SAN JOAQUIN IN EASTERN PATELLA IN PARTICULAR -- AND ALSO ON EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE TRANSFORM OF CLIMBING COMMUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE FUNDED A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION -- AND IN PARTICULAR WITH -- PERCENTAGE SET ASIDE FOR DISMANTLING CORPORATE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER INVESTED IN WHEN IT COMES -- TO BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE -- SERVICE NEEDS AND THE LIKE -- IN PARTICULAR THAT YOU SEE IN THE EASTERN TO TELL OF ALLEY WE'RE SEEING AMAZING PLANNING GRANTS HAPPENING THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT EVEN ABLE TO CURRENTLY IMPLEMENT -- DUE TO LOOK ELIGIBILITY CONSTRAINTS -- WE WERE LOOKING TO SEE THOSE CHANGED AS WELL AS PERCENTAGE -- DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE AREAS -- IN ADDITION I WANT HELLO THE DAY OR DAY JUSTER PROGRAM -- THIS PROGRAM MAY CLAIM BENFITS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT REALLY THOSE BENEFITS ARE NOT VERIFIED -- WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT CLEARLY WHAT WE ARE SEEING -- ARE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF HOLD THEIR SYSTEMS -- INCLUDING ENTERICA MISSIONS WATER CONTAMINATION AIR QUALITY AND OTHER ISSUES -- AND SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE QUESTIONING WHETHER OR THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING INTO THAT PROGRAM ARE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING -- GAS INFRASTRUCTURE AN UNSUSTAINABLE FARMING PRACTICES AT A LARGE SCALE -- RATHER THAN ACTUALLY INVESTING AND SHIFTING TOWARDS TRULY CLEAN ENERGY AND ECOLOGICAL WAYS OF DOING ANIMAL AGRICULTURE -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANY. CONTINUED CHOOSE YOUR OF MONEY SHOULD BE TARGETED TOWARDS THE DIRT I JUST A PROGRAM -- WHEN WE ASKED LEGISLATORS NO LONGER ALLOCATE FUNDS TO THIS PROGRAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH? MR TURN MEMBERS SO ELEVEN SALAS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH AND PUT A LOT OF THEM THOUGH AS WELL AS THE CHAIR -- ASSEMBLY WOMEN RACING REVISE IN REGARDS TO THE ONGOING CONCERN ABOUT A LACK OF FUNDING FOR NATURAL RESOURCE AS WELL AS NATURAL WORKING LANDS PROGRAM. AND ALSO JUST HIGHLIGHT A LETTER THAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATED TO THIS COMMITTEE -- THAT HAS SIGNATORIES MOST OF WHICH ARE BEHIND ME THAT DOES CALL FOR AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT YOU KNOW IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT THE BUDGET IS A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES IN. ORDER EVOLVING FOR NOT FUNDING THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS AS WE LOOK FOR TO ENGAGEMENT AND NOT FRONT AND ONE THING THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTION IS CLOSE A LOT OF TATIAN THAT WAS A BIG -- TOPIC OF CONCERN IN THE LAST YEAR IN THE LA -- DID REFERENCE SOME REALLY -- STRONG STATISTICS AS TO POTENTIAL REAL ESTATE THAT IS AT RISK -- AND ITS EQUIPMENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WHICH IS SIX POINT 5% OF THE STATE'S GDP -- AND FROM A FINANCE PERSPECTIVE WE THINK THOSE ARE REALLY LARGE NUMBERS AND ISSUES OF CONCERN. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THEN THE COMMISSION WITH A CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION HERE ON BEHALF OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES FOR ALL WE'RE A COALITION ITS MULTI MULTI SECTOR. AND LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN I'M IN HERE I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUES AND WE'RE HERE TO SEE HOW WE CAN INVEST IN ADVOCATE FOR INVESTING IN VIBRANT COMMUNITIES AND AND HOW WE CAN LOOK THESE FUNDS ADD TO REALLY ACHIEVE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BUT ALSO CREATE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION CHOICES FOR OUR LOWER LOWER INCOME -- OF FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE. OUR EFFORTS HAVE HELPED TO CREATE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AND ALSO THE TRANSIT OPERATIONS PROGRAMS THAT ARE. AWARDED IN THESE FUNDS BUT ALSO AND WE LOOK TO OTHER WAYS AND OTHER PROGRAMS TO COMPLEMENT THOSE -- THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH WE TODAY ARE LOOKING AT URBAN FOR STREAM GREENING -- RESIDENTIAL WEATHER'S STATION AND ALSO ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS SO -- YOU KNOW WHY WE DO THIS IS BECAUSE WE SEE A BENEFIT TO REDUCING THE HOUSEHOLD COSTS FOR FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE -- WHEN THERE'S MORE TO TRANSPORTATION CHOICES AND A HOUSING CHOICES ALSO THE ENERGY REDUCTIONS? AND THAT AND THEN ALSO THE JOB CREATIONS THAT COME OUT OF THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVE. AS I'LL BE SPEAKING TO HOW WE'RE INTERESTED TO SEE THE C. B. R. P. ALTHOUGH THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATION TODAY AND HOW THAT'S AN OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAM. WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADD ELECTRIC BIKES PEDAL ASSIST BIKES TO THIS PROGRAM AS A VIABLE OPTION FOR FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO GET A REBATE AND REPLACE THE CAR IN THEIR FAMILY. OR IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL AND A CHOICE IS TO BE ABLE TO AT REPLACE THEIR CAR TRIPS A LOT OF ALMOST HALF OF CAR TRIPS ARE ACTUALLY TWO THREE MILES OR LESS -- TO PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRAVELING AND THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH -- ELECTRIC BICYCLE RIDE -- STILL A BARRIER TO ACCESS -- TO PURCHASING CARD PURCHASING HE BIKES -- TO REPLACE CARS IN HOUSEHOLDS AND SO THIS WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE OPTION -- TO THOSE FAMILIES WERE ASKING FOR A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO THE C. B. R. P. FOR THAT OR TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM FOR AT ADDING THAT OPTION. THANK YOU. LOOK AT MORNING MANY OF SEVEN OLIVER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP IS AND A MEMBER OF THE SUITABLE COMMUNITIES FOR ALL ALLIANCE COALITION. AND SO IN PARTICULAR I WANT. TO APPLAUD THE COMMITTEES -- CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITY AND AN INVESTMENTS AND JUST COMPRESSIBILITY COMMUNITIES AND SO WHEN IT COMES THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM -- WHICH IS WHAT I AM ADVOCATING FOR A PROGRAM THAT UNIQUELY ADVANCES EQUITY ENVIRONMENTAL -- A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS I MISSION REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS. WE ASK FOR AN INCREASE STABILIZED -- INVESTMENT OF SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY. BE NECESSARY TO FOR THE PRO PROGRAM TO PHIL'S POTENTIAL -- AND ALSO THE PROGRAM HAS BENEFITED OVER ALMOST SIX THOUSAND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS -- HOPE HOPEFULLY SIR MANY MANY MORE ON THE A IT WHEN IN ADDITION -- TO ADVANCING CLIMB IN EQUITY GOALS THE PROGRAM ALSO -- YET WHEN IT COMES AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO HIS DIRECT CO BENEFITS AS WELL AS THE I STAY OF WITH THE DECOMPOSITION PARTICULAR SO WHILE WHEN IT. BESIDES TRANSPORTATION -- BUILDINGS ARE THE SECOND LEADING SOURCE OF GREAT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO -- WE HEAR TO STRESS. THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING THE CONVERSATION AS WELL WHEN IT COMES TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS THANK YOU. HI EVERYONE MY DEALER ACHO WITH. CALIFORNIA RELIEF ARE ALSO PART OF SYSTEM COMMUNITIES FOR ALL. THE URBAN GREEN AND OR URBAN FOR SHIPPERS ARE CRITICAL -- TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND LIVE ABILITY IN METROPOLITAN AREAS WITH THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM YOU ASKED ABOUT DEMAND SO FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES A RING GREEN PROGRAM THERE OR SUBSCRIBE ON AVERAGE AND BOTH PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN URBAN AREAS TO MEETING THE GREEN HOUSE REDUCTION TARGETS SET BY SB -- THIRTY TWO THESE PROGRAMS NOT ONLY ARE NOT ONLY THE PARMI CARBON SEQUESTRATION MECHANISM FOR THEY ALSO PROVIDE MULTIPLE CALL BENEFITS SUCH AS REDUCING. URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT -- BEING MANAGE STORM WATER -- IMPROVING AIR WATER QUALITY AND REDUCING -- ENERGY CONSUMPTION -- FOR THE REASONS THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE A LINE WE URGE YOU TO INVEST IN. THESE PROGRAMS WHICH HELP CREATE SYSTEMIC COMMUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS FROM THE DíAS ABOUT. THE SUBSTITUTION OF PROP. SIXTY EIGHT FOR AN EXPLANATION FOR AS HEARING OUT THESE -- PROGRAMS THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR. IT'S HAPPENED THIS YEAR AND EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT WE AS AN ADVOCATE FOR THESE PROGRAMS WE GO TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR AN EXPLANATION IT'S ALWAYS BEEN PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND THAT WAS EVEN BEFORE THE VOTERS PASSED PROP. SIXTY EIGHT SO -- I WANT TO VERIFY THAT THAT'S WHAT FROM MY AND THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING ANDI ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH. FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE URBAN GREENING PROGRAM -- THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT THEY CRAFTED THIS FOR DA SEASON I BUT I BELIEVE THAT I CAN SEE WHAT THE HOUSING AND IMPROVEMENTS TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS. BUT THEY'RE NOT DESIGNING IT TO IMPROVE THEIR TREE CANOPY OR GREENING SPACE WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THIS IS WHERE MOST OF THE PEOPLE LIVE WE NOW HEAT IS COMING HE DOES THE NUMBER ONE WEATHER RELATED. MORTALITY -- IMPACT AND IF YOU LIVE IN LAND IN PACOIMA OR YOUR DISTRICT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER AS WERE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE AND WE DON'T HAVE THOSE MATCHING SACRAMENTO WITHOUT TREES THAT'S WHAT. A LOT OF THEIR DISTRICT IS LIKE. SO -- I JUST WANNA SAY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING I APPRECIATE CHAMPION THESE OF PROGRAMS IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT AND THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS HANNIBAL SMITH AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY I COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TODAY AS WAS DISCUSSED IN IS EVIDENT BY THE REPORT ON THE CABIN TRADE PROCEEDS AND THEIR BENEFITS OF THE LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ARE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. IN REDUCING EMISSIONS BOTH AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND ALSO PROVIDE SOME OF THE HIGHEST BENEFITS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WHERE VERY THANKFUL FOR THE INITIAL PROPOSAL FOR THESE PROGRAMS THAT'S AND THE GOVERNOR'S FIRST -- BUDGET. BUT IN ORDER TO REACH OUR AIR QUALITY CLIMB IT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIETAL TARGETS WE THINK THAT THESE PROGRAMS -- NEED TO SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS HAS BEEN OUTLINED BY THEIR RESOURCES BOARD -- AS WELL AS IN OUR LETTER THAT IS MAKING THE ROUNDS IN THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW SO -- WE URGE YOU IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE FROM CAP AND TRADE REVENUE TO ALLOCATE IT TO THE LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THANK YOU. ONE OF THE MEAT ON A WITH AUTUMN ON CALIFORNIA WE ARE -- WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH PREVIOUS COMMENTS RELATED TO NATURAL RESOURCES THAT SECTOR -- WERE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR THE CHAIRS -- INDULGENCE THE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A SPECIFIC HEARING ON PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND AND HOW DID YOUR DID YOUR HALF WE THINK THAT IS. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- INVESTMENTS IN NATURAL RESOURCES IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS THROUGH CARBON SEQUESTRATION -- WITH THESE IMPORTANT AREAS IN -- WETLANDS ARE IRVINE GREENING THINGS LIKE THAT IF WE ARE REALLY TRULY SERIOUS ABOUT MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO START INVESTING NOW. WE THINK THAT THAT CONVERSATION NEEDS TO HAPPEN THANK YOU.

OTHER IMPORTANCE AT DISADVANTAGED KINI BENEFITS AIR HEALTH BENEFITS THAT RESULT AS A RESULT OF THAT. OZONE AND THAT HAVE PARTICULAR. AND HOPING TO MEET PARTICULATE MATTER STANDARDS. ALSO WE SUPPORT AB BOOSTING THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION LISTED UP TO NINETY NINE MILLION. AND VERY MUCH SUPPORT THAT'S GIVEN THAT THOSE BENEFITS GO INTO.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE JACK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL CALIFORNIA CONGENERS AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION WESTERN ACT PROCESSORS CALIFORNIA. INTERAMERICAN STASH YOUR GROWERS AND VARIOUS OTHER ACT TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AND COMMISSIONS -- VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE AIR DISTRICTS REQUEST TO INCREASE THAT FUNDING FOR DIESEL TRACTORS -- TRUCKS AND PUMPS TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AS IT'S BEEN STATED THESE ARE FANTASTIC PROGRAMS THAT ARE SHOWN TO BE WORKING AND IT GETS THOSE TRACTORS TRUCKS AND ATVS. THAT ARE OF THE LOWER TIER THAT CARS TRYING TO GET RID OF COMPLETELY CRASH THERE NEVER GOING TO BE USED AGAIN AND WE'RE INCREASING OUR ON AIR QUALITY OR MEETING OUR AIR QUALITY GO GOALS AND GETTING A LOT OF THOSE CO BENEFITS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION ON WITH SOME OF THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS DON'T WE WANT TO GET THE INDUSTRY TO JUST BE GOING THERE AN AGGIE HAS BEEN AND THEY'RE READY TO GO -- ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS PROGRAM IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SUCH HIGH QUALITY AIR QUALITY STANDARDS WERE GOING FOR THOSE TEAR FOR TRACTORS. IN AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE THEY THAT WE COMPETE WITH MANY OF OUR CROPS NIGHTS COTTON FRESH FRUIT -- THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME ONES SO FOR INSTANCE A FRONT LOADER. WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST OF GIANT TRACTOR WITH A BUCKET THAT FIX THINGS UP AND LOADED IN SOMETHING ELSE. IN AUSTRALIA THAT COST SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO GET A TEAR FOR ITS THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT COMPETING ON A GLOBAL MARKET AND TRYING TO MEET THOSE AIR QUALITY GOALS. ANY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO HELP FARMERS GET THEIR WELL BEING ABLE TO COMPETE GLOBALLY IS VERY IMPORTANT -- WERE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF INCREASING THE MANY ARE MANAGEMENT -- ALTERNATE MANY OR MANAGEMENT IN DERRY DIE JUSTER PROGRAMS UNDER CAP AND TRADE TO THE NINETY NINE MILLION -- THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS WELL AS THE OTHER CO BENEFITS -- MANY OF THE JERRY DIE JESTERS ARE ALSO MAKING RENEWABLE FUEL WHICH CAN HELP IN OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

THIS PROGRAM I INCENTIVIZE IS FARMS TO CONVERT TO CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS THAT CONVERT FROM OUTDATED DIESEL PUMPS TO SOLAR POWERED PUMPS. OUT REDUCE GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION AND MAKES A PARTICULARLY SMALL FARMS MORE RESILIENT TO DROUGHT -- I WANTED APPRECIATE THE MEMBER'S COMMENTS ABOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR THAT WE PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR THAT -- AUTOMATICALLY ENTERS THE 5% OF FUNDS FOR SWEEP HEALTHY SOILS AND THE ALTERNATE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. GOES TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS -- SO JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT -- IMPORTANT CHANGE TO THOSE PROGRAMS -- AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THREE THREE QUARTERS OF THE GRANTS THIS PROGRAM HAVE GONE TO SMALL AND MID SCALE FARMS. ON FOLLOWING THE THEME OF PROP. SIXTY EIGHT FUNDS -- SUPPLEMENTING NOT SUPPLANT TEEN -- THIS PROGRAM RECEIVED TWENTY MILLION LAST YEAR FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT WILL BE ENTIRELY SPENT ON BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. AS IF WE DON'T SEE GINGER A FUNDS THE PROGRAM WILL DISCONTINUE. AND AND THEN LASTLY WE ARE ALSO SEEKING A SMALL ASK OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY -- PLANNING AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS AND AGRICULTURE THANK YOU. MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS PAUL MASON THE PACIFIC FOR US TRUST ALL BE BRIEF -- WE SHARE ALL THE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT THE NETWORKING LAND PROGRAMS BEING ELIMINATED FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS A PLANT AND IS BACK FILLED WITH PROP. SIXTY EIGHT THE TERRIBLY INEFFICIENT USE OF BOND FUNDS -- AND WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THOSE SHOULD BE ADDITIVE -- IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BE INVESTING IN THESE NETWORKING LAND PROGRAMS FOR WETLANDS AND WATERSHEDS AND URBAN GREENING INTO THOSE SORTS OF ACTIVITIES BECAUSE IT HELPS ADVANCE OUR ADAPTATION GOALS AND WE'RE GONNA SEE A TERRIBLE AMOUNT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ARE ALSO MARIO'S. MAKING SURE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS ARE HELPING US TO PREPARE FOR THOSE THINGS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. FINALLY I WOULD KNOW THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE OUTSIDE OF THE CAP SECTOR ARE ALSO GOING TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND GETTING US THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. THAN BEING INVESTED IN PROGRAMS ARE OPERATING WITHIN THE CAP SECTOR. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DOCTOR JOEL CAMACHO I'M ORDERED FOR THE PLAN AND SAVING THE EARTH THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SYLVIA'S FELICIA ON BEHALF OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT WE HAVE TWENTY OF THE THIRTY MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE FACE SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES IN THE COUNTRY FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO PRIORITIZE THE INCLUSION OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. FOR THE FARMER PROGRAM TO REPLACE AG EQUIPMENT IN THE VALLEY AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN STATE RIGHT FUNDING FOR THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AS THE BUDGET PROCESS CONTINUES THANK YOU. MORNING MEANING FOR ON BEHALF OF THAT COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF AUGMENTING THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO DERRY DIE JESTERS AND JUST FOR THE RECORD I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFLICTING INFORMATION SHARED TODAY ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF DIRT AYE JESTERS. I'M IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR AS PART OF THE THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IMPLEMENTATION PREP PROCESS CARB ACTUALLY CONDUCTED THEIR OWN ANALYSIS. AND FOUND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN METHANE CARBON DIOXIDE NITROUS OXIDE PARTICULATE MATTER CARBON MONOXIDE SULFUR DIOXIDE MODEL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS HYDROGEN SULFIDE OF AN AMMONIA. INTEREST OXIDE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN WATER QUALITY I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND WITH% THE COMMITTEE WITH ALL OF YOUR STAFFS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MICHAEL BROKER ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT OF AN INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE JERRY. METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAM THAT'S BOTH THE DIE JESTER AND THE ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. IT IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING FOR US TO HEAR SOME OF THE MISINFORMATION -- PEOPLE -- I THINK CAN LOOK TO THE CLIMATE INVESTMENT REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT IT DOCUMENTS ONE CONCLUSION THAT YOU CAN DRAW. AND THAT IS THE JERRY DIED JUST A PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR IS ARGUABLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT INVESTMENT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY MAKING OF ALL SIXTY INVESTMENTS. MORE GHG REDUCTION EXPECTED FROM THAT PROGRAM SECOND MOST COST EFFECTIVE SUBSTANTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CO BENEFITS ALL THOSE THINGS TELL ME IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM LET ME GIVE YOU A CONCRETE EXAMPLE. EVERY DAY ABOUT A HUNDRED TRUCKS LEAVE KERN COUNTY ON THE WAY OVER THE HILL TO ARTESIAN MISS GARCIA'S DISTRICT WHERE THEY ARE DELIVERING MILK TO THE CALIFORNIA JERRY'S INCORPORATED PLANT. MOST OF THOSE BERRIES AND KERN COUNTY -- DEVELOPING NOTHING DIE JESTERS THAT WILL PRODUCE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORTATION FUEL WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO USE THAT TO REPLACE DIESEL ON THOSE TRUCKS ULTIMATELY SO THOSE TRUCKS THAT ARE GOING OVER. THE TO HATCH APPEASE INTO THE LA BASIN WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY BENEFITS IN THE VALLEY AND IN THE LA BASIN SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CO BENEFITS THAT THESE PROJECTS CAN PROVIDE. AND LASTED THIS ONE REMIND EVERYBODY IT'S ALL NOTHING WHICH MEANS WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM FASTER THAN OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE JUST REDUCING CARBON DIOXIDE. BECAUSE NOTHING TO SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS FOR THOSE REASONS WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO INCREASE FUNDING. LAST I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT -- THE PROGRAM IS CLOSING TODAY FOR APPLICATIONS SO THE MONEY THAT WAS PROVIDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WILL BE FULLY APPROPRIATED WE EXPECT AS WE'VE SEEN THE PAST FOUR YEARS. BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS WILL BE GREATLY OVERSUBSCRIBED SO THE NEED WILL BE THERE AS WE MOVE INTO THIS BUDGET CYCLE FOR NEXT YEAR TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING IN THE PROGRAM TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS NOT ENOUGH. THANK YOU. TIFFANY VAN WE HAVE LAND OF LAKES JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM THE AG INDUSTRY ON SUPPORTING FUNDING FOR METHANE REDUCTION. THANK YOU.

TO GET TO THAT ONE MILLION ACRES BY TWENTY THIRTY WE WILL CERTAINLY NEED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND ALSO SUPPORT THE CAL RECYCLE WASTE DIVERSION PROGRAM. I WANT TO JUST SAY A COUPLE WORDS ABOUT THE ALTAR IGNORE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THIS IS THE OTHER JERRY METHANE PROGRAM -- ONLY ABOUT 20% OF THE STATE'S -- JERRY FARMS CAN USE A DIE JESTER -- JUST TAKES TOO MUCH MINORITY CAPITAL FOR MOST AREAS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIGESTIVE PROGRAM BUT THE ALTERMAN OR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. HAS BEEN WORKING FOR A GREATER DIVERSITY OF OF TERRY'S AND LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK IT IMPORTANT -- TO EXPAND FUNDING TO MEET THE DEMANDS -- FARMER DEMAND FOR THAT PROGRAM HAS FAR EXCEEDED OUR CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS. ARE REACHING -- JERRY'S AND LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS IN THIRTEEN COUNTY IS COMPARED TO THE SIX COUNTIES FOR THE DIGEST OUR PROGRAM -- SO THAT'S WHY WE ASK -- TO HAVE A LINE ITEM FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR THE ALTAR OF MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM A FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS ON THE ALL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE GO THROUGH WHAT IS -- BECOME AN ANNUAL RITUAL IN THE SAYS SUBCOMMITTEE NO -- CHAIR TING I KNOW YOU HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

CAN YOU GO THROUGH WHY YOU ADDED ALL OF MILLION DOLLARS ADMINISTRATIVE COST INCREASE. THE THEORY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT IS TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE FOR CAUGHT FIRE OKAY ENDED SO WHERE AND WHERE IS THAT THAT'S GOING INTO CAL FIRE THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. AND THEN ALSO THERE'S A THERE'S A B. SIX SEVENTEEN STATE IMPLEMENTATION COST YOU.

THIS YEAR IN THE SPRING WE'RE GONNA BE REALLY SEEN OUR APPLICANT LECTURED VEHICLE CHARGING STATION STREAMLINING DEVELOPMENT GUIDE BOOK WHICH IS QUITE A MOUTHFUL SO JUST THE GUIDE BUCK BUT WE'RE FOCUSING IN ON THAT REALLY FOUR KEY AREAS PLANNING. PERMITTING ACCESSIBILITY AND INTERCONNECTION. AND DISTILLING TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE PERMITTING SITE IS REALLY TRACKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THAT COMPLIANCE WITH THE TWELVE THIRTY SIX WHICH IS THAT PASSED IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN I'M WITHIN THE IDEA IS A GREAT KIND OF A TRANSPARENT SYSTEM.

THROUGHOUT TIME -- ANOTHER BIG SUCCESSES IN OUR FLEET PROCUREMENT TODAY DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES BEEN DOING. INCIDENT REALLY GREAT PROGRAMMER TARGET FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WAS 15% OF NEW PURCHASES WOULD BE SABSE AND THEY ACTUALLY EXCEEDED THAT IT REACHED 30%. THAT WAS ENABLE A LOT BY THE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE OPEN AND OVER THOUSAND CHARGING STATIONS. AND THOSE FLEET VEHICLES ARE ALSO UTILIZE OUR PUBLIC HYDROGEN STATIONS. I IN TERMS OF FINDING THEIR STRONG COORDINATION ACROSS THE AGENCIES IN TWO KEY EXAMPLES HERE'S THE CAL YOU V. I. P. PROGRAM WHICH TREE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT'S REALLY DESIGNED TO FILL GAPS. IN THE C. P. U. C. IS YOU'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THEIR UNDERLINED EFFORTS TO YOU YOU KNOW BILL THE MARKET -- SO REALLY JUST LOOKING AHEAD I THINK THE FOCUS IS NOW ON SCALE. THAT FOR THE ZERO EMISSION MARKET I THINK THERE'S IS NO LONGER A QUESTION OF IF IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHEN. INCIDENT IN STATE LEADERSHIP REALLY REMAINS CRUCIAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WHEN IT'S AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I THOUGHT WAS EXCELLENT. AND BACK UP JUST FOR A MINUTE -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS BEEN MANAGING THE ALTERNATIVE. AND RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM. AND IT'S DESIGNED HELPS A TENER CLIMATE IN PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON THIS BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW HALF OF OUR GHGS COME FROM TRANSPORTATION IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR POLLUTANTS THAT HARM CALIFORNIANS COME FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR SO IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE GET THIS. THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAKE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR ARE GUIDED BY AN ANNUAL INVESTMENT PLAN THAT WE PUT TOGETHER WE THAT IT WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE DO WORKSHOPS WE HAVE BEEN -- IT ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT MEETS AND WEIGHS IN AND THEN WE ADOPT THAT -- THAT PLAN IN THE SPRING AND RECENTLY AT LAST YEAR SB ONE THOUSAND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. IN WHAT IT DIRECTS US TO DO IS TO LOOK AT THE INVESTMENT PLAN AND ASSESS WHETHER CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO WE ARE EAGER TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WERE WERE JUST NOW SCOPING OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT EXAMINATION AND IT PARTNERS WELL WITH AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN THAT ALL THAT I MENTIONED BRIEFLY LATER. WE ALREADY DO A PLAY A NUMBER OF TOOLS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION TOUCHES ALL CALIFORNIANS AND DOESN'T JUST BENEFIT -- POCKETS OF THE STATE -- PLEASE GIVE ME A FEW NUMBERS TO DATE WE HAVE INVESTED SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING AND SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE AND I WANT TO BREAK IT DOWN IN TERMS OF HYDROGEN AND LECTER VEHICLES. IN HYDROGEN WE'VE INVESTED A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS FUNDED SIXTY FIVE STATIONS IN THE STATE THAT ARE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE THIRTY NINE OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY UP AND RUNNING AND ACCESSIBLE TODAY -- WE EXPECT THE BALANCE TO BE ACCESSIBLE. HOPEFULLY SOON MAYBE AS MANY AS A DOZEN THIS YEAR WILL BE ADDED TO THAT. TO THAT TOTAL. AND WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN ABOUT -- LIGHTING AND OTHER ISSUES AT SOME OF THE STATIONS I'M A PROUD TO REPORT THAT THE CLOVER FIELD STATION WE HAVE LIGHTING -- NOW AND THE OTHER STATIONS ARE SAID TO HAVE LIGHTING AS WELL TO MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO USE THEM. TERMS OF THE V. IS -- LECTER VEHICLES WE HAVE -- NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WE'VE INVESTED TO DATE IN TWO EVEY INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE GOT ABOUT ANOTHER NINETY MILLION THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY. PUTTING INTO SOLICITATIONS TO PUT OUT ON THE STREET. THAT -- IS TYSON POINTED OUT HAS. CONTRIBUTED TO THE FORTY THOUSAND CHARGERS CHARGING -- HOOK UPS THAT WE HAVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT NUMBER IS ABOUT EQUALLY BALANCED BETWEEN -- PUBLIC PUBLIC. CHARGERS AND THEN SHARED PRIVATE CHARGERS SO THOSE WOULD BE AT COMPANIES THAT WANT PROVIDE THE FOR THE WORK FORCE OR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. AND IN ADDITION -- THERE ARE MANY THOUSANDS OF CHARGERS IN PEOPLE'S HOMES THOSE ARE COUNTED IN THOSE NUMBERS. YOUR STAFF REPORT WENT THROUGH SOME OF THE NUMBERS WE USE A TOOL WE CALL EVEY I PRO THAT WE PUT TOGETHER WITH THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY THAT. HELPS US IDENTIFY HOW MANY CHARGES WE NEED AND WHERE IN THE STATE TO SUPPORT THE THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TARGET BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THE THE ANSWER CAME OUT TO BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS WE NEED TO SUPPORT THAT MANY. SO. FORTY IS A IS A NICE DOWN PAYMENT ON THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BUT WE'VE GOT QUITE A WAYS TO GO -- I CAN DIG INTO THESE DEEPER IS NOT THE THESE NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT MORE DEEPLY BUT WANTED TO JUST -- FLAG THAT FOR THE COMMITTEE -- AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN ADOPTED ALSO LAST YEAR IT DIRECTS US -- TO LOOK AT A READ THE QUOTE IT'S WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE DO WE NEED C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> TO SUPPORT THE LEVELS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION REQUIRED FOR THE STATE TO MEET ITS GOAL OF PUTTING AT LEAST FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON CALIFORNIA ROADS BY. TWENTY THIRTY SO AGAIN WE'RE JUST SCOPING THIS PARTICULAR -- EFFORT AS WELL AND PLAN TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO SHARE PUBLICLY -- BEFORE LONG AND GET AND GET -- INPUT ON IT AS WE LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS HOW MANY CHARGES DO WE NEED TO SUPPORT A COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR SECTOR WE ARE. LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS THINGS I DESCRIBE I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK. TECHNOLOGIES ARE CHANGING QUICKLY THESE NUMBERS ARE FLUID AND THERE YOU KNOW WE WE WE LOOK AT A MARKING TIME WE WE PROJECT AGAINST THE FUTURE WE TRY TO ACHIEVE THOSE TARGETS BUT THINGS LIKE -- AND IT WILL GO THROUGH A MALL BUT JUST AS AN EXAMPLE MOBILE CHARGING RIGHT NOW WE ASSOCIATE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING WITH. A PARTICULAR PARKING SPACE IN A IN A LOT SOMEWHERE AND THERE'S A YOU KNOW THERE'S A NO PARKING SIGN UNLESS YOU'RE ANY V. AND YOU KNOW IT WORKS FINE FOR WHAT IT DOES BUT WE'RE LOOKING OUT THESE MOBILE CHARGE THE CAN BE WE'LL BETWEEN. VEHICLES WHEREVER THEY ARE IN THE PARKING LOTS EVEN IF THE LOCK UP SPACES FOR A PURPOSE OR HAVE SOMEBODY CHARGE FOR FOUR HOURS AND THEN LEAVE THE CAR THERE AND MEANWHILE THE NEXT PERSON WANTS TO CHARGE CAN'T BECAUSE THE THE THE YOU KNOW THE CABLES ARE LONG ENOUGH. THIS IS ONE OF MANY THINGS THAT ARE REALLY CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE IN OUR TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN EFFORT. WILL LOOK AT ALL THESE THINGS AS WELL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. X. WE HAVE UP UC. A WELL OR IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT ORDER THAT'S OKAY THAT'S FINE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR BLOOM AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PEACE CALL AND I MET. THE DIRECTOR AT THAT THAT CPC'S ENERGY DIVISION AND WITH ME IS KERRY SISTER OR LEAD ANALYST ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION ISSUES TO THEM. THIS MORNING I'LL PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF THE PC'S EFFORTS TO DATE TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S OF GOALS AND MS SISTER WILL BE RESPONDING TO THE STAFF COMMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDED IN THE AGENDA. TO DATE THE CQC IS AUTHORIZE ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN UTILITY UTILITY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO SUPPORT. THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LIGHT DUTY CHARGING PORTS AT WORKPLACES AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS -- MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS REQUIRED TO ELECTRIFY APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND VEHICLES -- A PUBLIC DC FAST CHARGING PROGRAM TO PROVIDE UP TO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR NEW FAST CHARGING PORTS -- AS WELL OTHER SEVERAL ADDITIONAL PILOT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO ZAP ADOPTION VERTICALLY ANAHEIM EMISSION REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES. SUCH AS PORT ELECTRIFICATION EQUIPMENT AND A REFRIGERATED TRUCK IDOLING REDUCTION PROGRAM. THE CPC ALSO OVERSEES THE HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DOLLAR ENERGY SETTLEMENT. AND SO FAR -- TO DATE TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE DC FAST CHARGING STATIONS -- HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AS WELL AS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED LEVEL TWO CHARGING PORTS. ALSO A TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN CARVED OUT -- FOR PAUSES THAT SUPPORT RESIDENTS IN MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS -- THE ENERGY AND ESTIMATES THAT THEY WILL DEVELOP -- FOURTEEN TO TWENTY OF THESE PAUSES WITH THOSE FUNDS AND FOR INSTALLED THE DAY. THERE -- ACTIVELY UNDERWAY IN GETTING A LOT MORE OF THOSE PUT IN -- PRETTY SOON HERE -- LET'S SEE THERE ALSO -- SEVERAL PILOTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENERGY SETTLEMENT -- THREE ARE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC EVEY TECHNOLOGIES TOUGH SUCH AS HIGH POWER CHARGING. AND MICRO GRADES THEY'RE ALSO TO PROJECTS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THE SOCIAL BENEFITS OF EVEY THAN UNDERSERVED AREAS. SUCH AS SHARED ELECTRIC SHUTTLES AND EVEY SHARING. THE SET THAT SAID THAT BUDGET. IS ANTICIPATED BE FULLY SPENT BY JUNE OF THIS YEAR. FINALLY THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL PRACTICALLY BILLION DOLLARS -- IN UTILITY PROPOSALS CURRENTLY UNDER SI PC REVIEW. INCLUDING -- A PROGRAM TO ELECTRIFY BETWEEN THREE THOUSAND SIX OUT THOUSAND MEDIUM AND HEAVY HEAVY DUTY ARE HAVE A DENSITY VEHICLES IN S. T. G. EAT SERVICE TERRITORY -- EXTENSION OF EDISON'S LIGHT DUTY PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ANOTHER APPROXIMATELY FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND CHARGING PORTS -- AND PILOT PROGRAMS TO INSTALL A LIGHT DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE AT SCHOOLS AND STATE PARKS AND BEACHES. FINALLY I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK TO THAT P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY IMPACT WE ARE NOT EXPECTING. THE P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY TO IMPACT ALREADY APPROVED PROGRAM SINCE HE'S BUDGETS WERE INCLUDED IN THE IMPEACHING IS BUSINESS OPERATING COSTS AND WE'RE AUTHORIZED BY THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE -- END OF THAT REMAINING BILLION DOLLARS IN A WHICH IS -- LITTLE LESS CERTAIN ONLY FIFTEEN OF MILLION OF THAT IS P. GINNY FOR OUR OUR ASSOCIATE PGA PROJECT SO -- LARGELY THE PIGEON THE PROJECTS AROUND THE TABLE OF ALREADY BEEN AUTHORIZED AND APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE. WITH THAT I WILL TURN THIS OVER THE MIKE OVER -- TO IS SISTER WHO CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS ON TODAY'S AGENDA. GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME'S KERRY SYSTEM AN ANALYST WITH ENERGY DIVISION AT THE SI PC -- I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THE DIFFERENT STAFF COMMENTS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE AGENDA BRIEFLY -- FIRST THE GAPS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS THAT HAVE THE WORST AIR QUALITY FOR EACH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS THE CPC HAS AUTHORIZED THE I A USED TO INVEST IN TO DATE -- WE'VE INCLUDED TARGETS FOR EACH AYE A YOU TO FOCUS INVESTMENTS EITHER A PERCENT OF THE BUDGET OR AND PERCENT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE INSTALLED. DEBIAN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS DEFINED BY THE CALLING BY RISKY -- AND I'LL NOTE THAT THE I A USE HAVE TYPICALLY EXCEEDED THOSE TARGETS THAT THE CPC ADOPTS FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE LIGHT DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS THE TARGETS HAVE BEEN TYPICALLY AROUND 10% OF THE BUDGET. AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE CLOSER 240250% OF THE BUDGET BEING FOCUSED ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ON THIS IF YOU SEE IS ALSO ADOPTED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MORE RECENTLY ADOPTED -- INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS SO THAT WE CAN HELP MEASURE THE IMPACT OF THESE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS SPECIFICALLY ON AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS -- IN TERMS OF THE ADEQUACY OF THE GRADE AND ALTERNATIVES -- THIS IS A CRITICAL FOCUS OF THE CPC ACROSS ALL OF OUR PROCEEDINGS NOT JUST. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND WE DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN AND DIRECTING THE UTILITIES TO TRACK AND MONITOR THE IMPACT OF INCREMENTAL AB LOAD ON ON THE GRID SINCE. TWENTY ELEVEN AND THEY'VE BEEN FILING AND ANNUAL REPORTS TO TRACK ANY -- DISTRIBUTION GREAT UPGRADES NECESSARY -- TO DATE THEY HAVEN'T FACED ANY SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES SPECIFICALLY TARGETED. TO INCREMENTAL EVEY LOAD BUT WE EXPECT THAT THEY'LL START TO SEE -- AS AS MORE EAGLES ARE ADOPTED THAT INCREMENTAL ET LOAD WILL ONLY GROW SO WHERE WE DIRECTED THEM TO CONTINUE MONITORING THAT BUT BEYOND THAT DIDN'T THERE'S NO. REAL OBVIOUS ACTION NEEDED AT THIS POINT. IN TERMS OF THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND CONGESTION THE CBC'S WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD -- AS IT DEVELOPS THE GREEN MILE STANDARD THAT WAS ADOPTED LAST YEAR IN SB. TEN FOURTEEN AND ALSO WITH THE CPC TO EVALUATE THE INCREMENTAL ET INFRASTRUCTURE -- AS WAS JUST DISCUSSED UNDER AB -- TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN ONE THING THAT WE WOULD NOTE IS THAT -- TO AVOID AGE ON GOING CONGESTION ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH -- RIDE HAILING FLEETS AND AUTONOMOUS LEADS -- THE CPC WOULD LIKE TO SEE. INCENTIVES THAT ENCOURAGE. DRIVERS OR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO AVOID TRAVELING WITH EMPTY VEHICLES -- SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ACADEMIC PARTNERS IN THIS DEEP CC TO STUDY THE CURRENT DRIVING AND CHARGING PATTERNS OF DIFFERENT RILEY RIDE HAILING. PROGRAMS AND DRIVERS TO HELP INFORM PRIORITY LOCATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL ET CHARGING STATION DEPLOYMENTS AND ALSO INVESTIGATING WAYS THAT TO DIRECT INSTILLATION OF INCENTIVES OF INFRASTRUCTURE -- THAT SUPPORTS PICK UP AND DROP OFF LOCATIONS THAT INCREASE ACCESS TO TRANSIT HUBS AND MY CREDIBILITY OPTIONS. FOR CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE -- SPECIFICALLY TARGETING MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY AND VEHICLES AS PETE MENTIONED WE'VE AUTHORIZED AS C. E. AND P. JEANNIE TO SPEND. NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ON INFRASTRUCTURE DISAPPEAR SUPPORT THESE TYPES OF VEHICLES AND ARE EVALUATING WHETHER TO AUTHORIZE AS DID YOU NEED TO SPEND FIFTEEN MILLION ON SIMILAR PROGRAMS -- I'D SAY HERE ONE THING WE'VE TARGETED IN THESE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS ARE TRANSIT AND SCHOOL BUSES WE'VE OFFERED ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE SPECIFICALLY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ELECTRIFY THOSE MORE CRITICAL -- PRIORITY EFFORTS BECAUSE IT INSIDE IN PART BECAUSE THEY ALIGN WITH OTHER STATE AGENCY FUNDING -- FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY AND SCHOOL BUS REPLACEMENT EFFORTS -- AND ALSO BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT REGULATORY EFFORTS TO TRANSITION THE TRANSIT SECTOR TWO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES -- AND THEN FINALLY THE STATE ROLE IN ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR IS THAT CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE -- OUR MAIN POINTS WE'D LIKE TO MAKE HERE IS IF THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO ADOPT FURTHER REQUIREMENTS -- FOR PUBLIC CHARGING EQUIPMENT IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGICAL OR OPEN ACCESS AT REQUIREMENTS IT SHOULD CONSIDER ESTABLISHING GRANDFATHERING. PROVISIONS THAT ENSURE ALREADY DEPLOYED CHARGING STATIONS CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE THROUGH THEIR USEFUL LIFE RATHER THAN HAVING TO BE REPLACED PREMATURELY [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN WOMEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS THE TEACHING OF A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT EVEY INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT UNDER THE V. W. SETTLEMENT. SO BEFORE I GET INTO THE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT SOMEONE I JUST KIND OF WANT TO BACK UP I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO JUST REMEMBER -- FROM EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DIESEL VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAD DEFEAT DEVICES THAT WERE DESIGNED TO AVOID THE KNOX EMISSION CONTROL. SO AS A RESULT OF THIS AND A CONSENT DECREE GETTING CAUGHT IN A CONSENT DECREE. A VW WAS REQUIRED TO DO FOUR MAIN THINGS SO THE FIRST THING THEY HAD TO DO WAS THEY HAD. TO EITHER FIX THE VEHICLES ARE GET THEM OFF THE ROAD. THE SECOND THING IS THEY PAID A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY. THE THIRD THING IS THEY HAD TO MAKE UP THE EXTRA NOT EMISSIONS SO THEY'VE PROVIDED FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE ARE ADMINISTERING CARBONS ADMINISTERING AND THIS IS SOMETIMES KNOWN AS APPENDIX D.. AND THEN FINALLY THE REQUIRED TO INVEST EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT THE INCREASED USE OF THAT IS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY THAT'S CALLED APPENDIX FEES SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL CALL IT. SO VW IS IMPLEMENTING APPENDIX THE SEE THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARY ELECTRIFY AMERICA WE SOMETIMES CALL THAT EA. AND THIS INVESTMENT IS MADE IN FOUR CONSECUTIVE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR THIRTY MONTH ZAB IMPLEMENTATION PLAN CYCLES. THERE ARE FOUR AREAS THAT YOU CAN -- INVEST IN UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE. SO ONE OF THEM IS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. ONE IS BRANDED NEUTRAL PUBLIC AWARENESS SO AWARENESS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES BUT NOT NECESSARILY ANY PARTICULAR BRAND. INCREASING ZAB ACCESS THROUGH THINGS LIKE RIDE AND DRIVE EVENTS AND THEN ALSO GREEN CITY PILOTS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION PROJECTS LIKE. THAT CAR SHARING AND TRANSIT -- ESPECIALLY IN LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO THE BOARD APPROVED ELECTRIFY AMERICA'S CYCLE ONE SEVEN BEST A PLAN IN JULY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AFTER A PUBLIC WORKSHOP AND THREE BOARD MEETINGS. AND SO THIS PLAN PROVIDES FOR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF HIGHWAY FAST CHARGERS. FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CHARGING IN THE SIX LARGEST METRO AREAS IN THE STATE AREAS LIKE WORKPLACE RETAIL MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN AWARENESS PLAN -- THROUGH WEB BASED SOCIAL MEDIA REGULAR SORT OF TV AND RADIO AND THEN ALSO THE SELECTION OF SACRAMENTO AS THE GREEN CITIES PILOT. SO AS PART OF THIS PILOT ELECTRIFY AMERICA'S PROVIDING FORTY FIVE FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO THE SACRAMENTO AREA. FOR TWO NEW CAR SHARING SERVICES ZERO EMISSION SHUTTLE AND TRANSIT BUSES AND THE ASSOCIATED CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND MARKETING -- ELECTRIFY AMERICA HAS BEEN BUSY IMPLEMENTING THEIR CYCLE ONE PLAN TO DATE THEY HAVE LICENSE OR AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN STATION SITES. SEVENTY TWO OF THESE ARE IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS THIRTY FIVE HAVE BEEN PERMITTED. NINE OF THE SITE WORK IS COMPLETE BUT THEY'RE NOT YET OPEN AND FIVE OF THEM HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED AND ARE OPEN. ON EA IS COORDINATING WITH THE I. O. U.'S DIRECTLY AND CARP HELPS COORDINATE BETWEEN CDC AND ELECTRIFY AMERICA TO HELP IDENTIFY POTENTIAL OVERLAPS IN WERE STATIONS ARE BEING CITED -- WITH RESPECT TO THE SACRAMENTO GREEN CITIES PILOT ELECTRIFY AMERICA HAS PLACED A HUNDRED OF A PLAN TO TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY CARSHARE CHEVY BOTH T. V.'S. I'M AS PART OF THE SECOND CAR SHARE THEIR PUTTING. ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT APARTMENT BUILDINGS THEY'RE DESIGNED FOR SORT OF ROUND TRIPS AND THEY'VE GOT ABOUT HALF OF THE SEVENTY ONE APARTMENT BUILDINGS -- IDENTIFIED AND SIGNED UP FOR THAT PROGRAM AND THEY'VE ALSO BEGUN INSTALLING DEDICATED LEVEL TWO CHARGING. I'M AS THAT MR ECKERSLEY OF POINTED OUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PERMITTING HURDLES AS THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS THEY'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH GOBIZ WHICH IS REALLY HELPED A LOT. AND WE THINK THAT THE GUIDE BOOK WILL ALSO HELP AND SMOOTH THIS PROCESS AS WE GO FORWARD -- I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CYCLE TO PLAN AND THIS PLAN WILL BEGIN ON JULY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND IT WAS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD. AND DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AFTER A PUBLIC MEETING AND TWO BOARD MEETINGS. SO THIS PROVIDES -- TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE FOR THE HIGH SPEED I CHARGING NETWORK ON THE HIGHWAY. NINETY FIVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION FOR COMMUNITY CHARGING IN THE NINE LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREAS IN THE STATE. TEN TO FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR RESIDENTIAL AND RURAL LEVEL TWO CHARGING. SIX TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRANSIT BUS CHARGING AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE CHARGING -- FOR ZAP TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES AND THEN TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BOOST STATION UTILIZATION AND THAT AWARENESS. WE'VE BEEN MEETING MONTHLY WITH ELECTRIFY AMERICA AND WE RECEIVE QUARTERLY WRITTEN REPORTS WE EVALUATE EACH OF THESE REPORTS FOR ADHERENTS TO THE 35% DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES INVESTMENT GOAL. ON THEIR SECOND ANNUAL REPORT IS DUE TO US AT THE END OF APRIL AND WE WILL BE USING THAT TO PREPARE. OUR FIRST ANNUAL SB NINETY TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD DELIVER LATER THIS YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION -- EARLIER I SAID B. W. WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO FULLY MITIGATE THEIR KNOCKS EMISSIONS. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT MOST OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO VEHICLE REPLACEMENT. BUT THAT PLAN ALSO INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR LIGHT DUTY ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT IS MANAGING THAT PIECE OF IT FOR THE WHOLE STATE. WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE BAY AREA DISTRICT AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION SO THAT THAT COMPONENT IS IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT'S COORDINATED WITH OTHER STATE INVESTMENTS. AND THEN FINALLY WE WERE ASKED TO ADDRESS THE RECENT FIAT CHRYSLER SETTLEMENT FOR ADMISSION STANDARDS VIOLATIONS -- SO THE SCA SETTLEMENT IS STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN SETTLEMENT. I'M CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO RECEIVE SEVENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FORTY FIVE POINT EIGHT OF THIS IS AND PENALTIES AT A LITTLE OVER NINETEEN MILLION IS FOR ADMISSIONS MEDICATION. THESE PAYMENTS UNDER STATE LAW ARE DEPOSITED INTO THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUNDS AND THEN THEY'LL BE MANAGED THROUGH THE NORMAL YOU KNOW BUDGET PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. I THINK CUT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- LA -- MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS. AMANDA MARTIN DEPARTMENT FINANCE I'LL BE VERY BRIEF -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN THE BUDGET BILL PROPOSED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MAINTAINS FUNDING LEVELS AND JUST READ LAST YEAR AS YOU HEARD FROM ISSUE ONE INCLUDES THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDS FOR THEIR RESOURCES FOR ITS CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT. OF THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION FOR THEIR TO COMMISSIONS ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES THE NINETY FIVE MILLION AVAILABLE FOR GRANT FUNDING -- THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL ON THAT INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDED THIS YEAR AS WE'RE NOT REQUESTING A CHANGE IN THE LEVEL OF THE FUNDING APPROPRIATED -- HOWEVER AS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA AND DISCUSSED HERE TODAY -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES -- VARIOUS PROPOSALS FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION PUBLIC TO LIST MISSION AN AIRPORT. I'M TO IMPLEMENT. ZERO MISSION VEHICLE RELAY LEGISLATION INCLUDING AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN SB ONE THOUSAND SB. TEN FOURTEEN BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE RECENTLY RELEASED SPRING FINANCE LETTER. A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND SIX POSITION THE REQUESTED TO IMPLEMENT THE RECENT THAT LEGISLATION WHICH AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD WILL HELP INFORM OUR FUTURE AND PAST. THANK YOU. DROUGHT. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- YOUR AGENDA DOESN'T I'D PROBABLY NOT A LOT OF THE KEY QUESTIONS AND ISSUES AND AN ADMINISTRATION IS ALREADY TOUCHED ON A LOT OF THEM SO I'M GONNA KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE A COUPLE KEY QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK. YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONTROL THE JEWEL AND ON AN ASTON MINISTRATION ONE IS RELATED TO THE ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AROUND IS CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY BOTH AND NO -- NO THOMAS VEHICLES AS WELL AS CHARGING TECHNOLOGIES AND BASICALLY HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS PLANNING ON KIND OF YOU KNOW HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUST TO THOSE CHANGES INCOME NOT KNOWING EXACTLY HOW THOSE TECHNOLOGIES WILL EVOLVE AND SO. WHAT THE PLAN IS FOR KIND OF ADJUSTING OF AS THOSE THINGS CHANGE OVER TIME THE SECOND ISSUE RELATED TO HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES WHICH WAS ALSO TOUCHED ON? A LOT OF THE FUNDING FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE IS COMING FROM THE I'LL USE SO I THINK SOME THERE'S ARE SOME KEY QUESTIONS AROUND HERE WHERE WHERE THEY GAPS ON KIND OF YOU KNOW HEAVY DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ISN'T FUNDED. A AND I OWE YOU TERRITORIES AND HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS PLANNING ON ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS AS WELL AS COORDINATION WITH BETWEEN AGENCIES -- CAR PROVIDES A LOT OF THE INCENTIVES FOR THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND SO HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS THINKING ABOUT IN A WHINING KIND OF THE HEAVY DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE VEHICLES GIVEN THAT -- THE FUNDS ARE COMING FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES SO ON MY COMMENTS THERE THANK YOU QUESTIONS AND IF YOU HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT. TO NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO STEP FORWARD. MS GARCIA FOLLOWED BY CHAIR TANK. AT THANK YOU I DEFINITELY WANT TO SEE ALL THESE PROGRAMS BE SUCCESSFUL -- BECAUSE THAT'LL HELP THEIR QUALITY IN MY DISTRICT IN AND AROUND THE STATE. AND WHETHER IT'S THE PAST THE PASSENGER CARS FOR THE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS YOU KNOW THAT MAKE SURE SELL IMPORT AND I THOUGHT. QUESTIONS THOUGH AS WE ARE LEADING THE IDEA USE OR ASKING THEM TO INVEST. HOW IS THIS BANKRUPTCY WITH PGA ANY GONNA AFFECT THEY'LL SEPARATE SPECIALLY AS WE WORRY ABOUT OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ARE WE? AT THE AGENCY LEVEL HAVING DISCUSSIONS OF HOW. TO WORK AROUND OR WORK WITH THAT ISSUE THAT'S OUT THERE PENDING AND THOSE THOSE EFFORTS POSSIBLY BEING. AFFECTED AND 40% OF THE STATE. SO YEAH AS I NOTED ON MY PRESENTATION -- ALMOST ALL OF P. GENIES -- INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN REQUESTED HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION AND THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE SO THERE ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL. OBJECTS THAT FOR WHICH THAT FUNDING IS AN UNCERTAIN BUT IT IT'S IT'S VERY SPEAKING OF IT MOST OF THAT FUNDING IS ALREADY APPROVED. AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE. AND I HEARD A SAID FIFTEEN BILLION BILLION FIFTEEN MILLION OF THE OF THE NEXT. ABSOLUTELY I KNOW FIFTEEN MILLION. OF THE OF THE ONE BILLION TOTAL THIS ON THE TABLE SO BASICALLY P. GENIES -- PORTION OF THE TOTAL ALL IN ALL I KNOW YOU FUNDS WERE KIND OF FRONT LOADED IN THE FIRST APPROVAL SO MOST OF WHAT'S ON THAT STILL ON THE TABLE AND THAT SECOND BILLION. ARE -- SAN DIEGO AND ADDISON PROJECTS ACTUALLY IN AND THE OTHER THE SMALL AREAS AS WELL. AND THEN I JUST HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND A SHORT COMMENT ON YOUR A APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE OF IDENTIFIED SEVENTY ONE APARTMENT BUILDINGS. TO PROVIDE THE CERRO -- THE SEVEN RIGHT SHARE. HOW DID YOU GUYS GO ABOUT SELECTING THESE? SEVENTY ONE APARTMENTS ARE HOW ARE THESE BETTER ON THE STATE SO -- THIS IS IT SAID THESE ARE FOR THAT SACRAMENTO GREEN CITY PILOT PROGRAM CITIES ARE IN SACRAMENTO -- AND ALL OF A ELECTRIFY AMERICA'S THE ONE WHO'S OPERATING THAT PROGRAM SO I WOULD AND I DON'T KNOW IFYOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW. SO ACT ELECTRIFY AMERICA WORKING WITH APARTMENT BUILDINGS TO IDENTIFY SO THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE OPERATING THAT RIGHT -- AND THEN MY LOVE COME IN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW DO W GET. TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAD WE MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS AND APARTMENTS HAVE ACCESS AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE. MAKING EFFORTS -- OUT THERE IN TRYING TO LEARN AND GROW. IN THAT SPACE I I DO WORRY THOUGH ABOUT THESE COMMUNITIES. I I LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST PUTTING IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE ABOUT THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE CARS. INTO WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE USED CAR MARKET OR THROUGH OTHER INCENTIVES -- I I KNOW WE HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OUT THERE AND I'VE WORKED WITH THEIR DISTRICTS TRY TO MAKE SURE MY COMMUNITY AS A WAR THEM AND TRIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THEM. AND WHILE THE INCENTIVES ARE PRETTY LARGE -- NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS UP -- TO AND IT STILL HAS BEEN CANCELED OUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY IN AND WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO AFFORD. SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE US AS WE'RE DOING THIS WORK AND WE'RE TRACKING WE'RE TRACKING AND WORK ADJUSTING ALONG THE WAY. ABSOLUTELY SO UNDER THAT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON KIND OF THE EQUITY COMPONENT IN TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AS WELL ON TO THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. IN AND I SAY IT JOKINGLY BUT IT'S REALLY NOT A JOKE I FEEL SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE LIKE OPRAH WINFREY AND SAY LIKE YOU GET A HEART YOU GET A HOT. SO WHEN I TALK TO THE CAR DEALERS IN MY DISTRICT THAT TELL ME WELL FOLKS IN YOUR COMMUNITY ARE COMING IN AND IT MIGHT BE CASH BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF INSTABILITY OR THEIR EMIGRANTS AND EVEN MORE SO NOW WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION. SO THEY WANT TO SPEND BETWEEN THREE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT I WANT TO HAVE. BEEN SECURITY OF A PAYMENT IF THERE'S A FAMILY EMERGENCY AND SO A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR. PROGRAM IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT STILL DOESN'T GET THEM TO THE POINT WHERE THEY PENCILS AND FOR THEM TO BUY THESE CARS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH USE CARS ON THE MARKET OUT THERE AS WELL. PART OF IT IS THAT COMPANIES ARE TAKING THE BACK SO WE CAN LEARN FROM THEM AND AND THAT'S FAIR -- IN IN THAT BERRIER BUT WHEN I'M TALKING TO MY DAUGHTERS ARE LIKE THEY CAN'T I'M SORRY I TALK TOO MUCH UNTIL BLUE IN THE FACE ABOUT THESE. THESE PROGRAMS BUT THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO TO DO IT OR NOT ONLY TO DO AT LEAST -- BECAUSE THAT STILL VERY AFFORDABLE SO IT'S TRYING TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE AT ON AND SO IT'S I ALMOST TO THE POINT OF HOW DO I MAKE A CAR BE BETWEEN THREE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH MAKES ME LIKE OPRAH WINFREY SAID ONLY BUT I DO THINK WE NEED. TO START THINKING AND AND THOSE DIRECTIONS AS TO TALK ABOUT EQUITY. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IN JUST A FAULT WITH MY FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM BELL'S COMMENTS I I THINK -- WE'RE NOW AT A POINT WHERE THERE IS A USED CAR MARKET THERE ARE SOME USED CARS THAT ARE CHEAP -- IN THAT PRICE RANGE BUT THEY HAVE LIMITED RANGE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A PAIR AYE THE CONCERN SO -- WE DEFINITELY NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE USED CARS BACK INTO COMMUNITIES BECAUSE ARE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY THAT'S ALL THEY BY IS USED CARS THAT'S THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN NEW CARS THEY DON'T THEY DON'T FIND A VERY -- COST EFFECTIVE. IN IN THAT IN THAT WAY -- AND SO I THINK THAT THE LINKING GOT UP ALSO -- DEAF TELLING WITH HER COMMENTS -- YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE MULTI FAMILY STRATEGY OR WHAT IS THIS WHAT IS THE STRATEGY IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT OF NUMBER OF MULTI FAMILY -- TENANTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN MY CITY WERE YOU THINK THERE BE A HUGE AMOUNT OF ADOPTION WE ARE SORT OF TAPPED OUT BECAUSE 65% OF OUR COMMUNITY ARE TENANTS. IN SO -- THERE THAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON OUR STREETS WE WOULD ACTUALLY DO MORE IF THERE WAS A MORE. ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN FACT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S FASCINATING THE FEW FAST CHARGERS THAT ARE IN. SAN FRANCISCO -- ALL EVERYBODY'S COMPETING WITH ALL THE LIFT AND UBER DRIVERS. TO TO GET TO THEM SO IT'S YEAH PROBABLY I THINK EVEN IN ALL OF SAN FRANCISCO PROBABLY. TEN OR TWENTY FAST CHARGERS WHICH SEEMS KIND OF SHOCKING FOR OUR POPULATION FOR WHO WE HAVE THAT ON YOU KNOW IF YOU COULD SORT OF ADDRESS THAT THE THAT THE THE OTHER PIECE I'D LIKE TO HEAR AS GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU KNOW VW -- THE I'LL USE YOU MENTIONED ENERGY SETTLEMENT -- I BELIEVE -- FARRAH PUT TOGETHER IN IN THE REPORT SORT OF A LOW ESTIMATE NEED A HIGHEST MAY NEED GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT IS IS. IS HAPPENING ARE WE ARE WE GOING TO HIT THE LOWER SUBMITTED NEED ARE HITTING THE HIGHEST ME ARE WE STILL SHORT WHAT IS. WHAT'S WHAT IS OUR AND TO ANTICIPATED. PRODUCTION GIVEN ALL THE WORK THAT WE CURRENTLY KNOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAYBE I'LL TAKE YOUR YOUR SECOND QUESTION AND LET -- COLLEAGUE SPEAK TO THE MULTI FAMILY ISSUE WERE WORKING ON THAT AS WELL BUT AS FAR AS THE NUMBERS THAT WERE IN THE REPORT -- MY I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO PAGE TWENTY FIVE AND THESE ARE NUMBERS WE PREPARED AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE LOW ESTIMATE OF NEED. WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND CHARGERS SHY OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GOAL. WE THE ENERGY COMMISSION REVISED THESE NUMBERS DOWNWARD SO NOW THAT ESTIMATE IS MORE LIKE. SEVENTY THOUSAND AND THAT WAS DUE TO TWO FACTORS THE FIRST IS WE'VE INCLUDED PRIVATE SHARED CHARGER SO MULTI FAMILY THAT EXIST AND PARKING LOTS OF BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO SUPPLY CHARGES FOR THEIR FOR THEIR THE EMPLOYEES ARE YOU KNOW WHOLE FOODS NEAR WHERE I LIVE HAS A COUPLE CHARGED. YESTERDAY SO WE ADD THOSE IN THOSE THOSE OTHER CHARGERS THAT BRINGS THAT NUMBER DOWN STILL A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT GAP AND WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO -- I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT HOWEVER THOUGH THAT THESE THESE LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER FUNDERS YOU IDENTIFIED THAT ARE THAT ARE PUTTING IN CHARGERS AROUND THE STATE. BUT THE NUMBERS I WOULD SAY THESE THESE -- SHORTFALLS WERE LOOKING AT PRETTY CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE THE NUMBERS WE SUPPLY THE COMMITTEE AND THE ONES I JUST SHARED WITH YOU. ARE BASED ON FUNDING THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY AND AS WE HEARD FROM THE P. YOU SEE THEY'RE ENTERTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUEST THAT WILL GO BEYOND THAT SO WE EXPECT THOSE THAT SHORTFALL THE SNAPSHOT IN TIME IS LIKELY TO GO DOWN. THANK YOU FOR TO SORT OF CLARIFYING THAT THE SLIDE AYE NOW I'M KIND OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT IS. SO SO YOU'RE SAYING THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND BETWEEN NOW. AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE SORT OF EVERYTHING THAT WE NO OF AS OF THIS THE SECOND ARE WHENEVER YOU DO THAT NOW TO SUCH PUBLIC. PRIVATE EVERY EVERYTHING I SHOULD BE CLEAR -- NO THAT'S EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS FUNDING WHAT WE KNOW OF THE OTHERS THAT YOU IDENTIFY MUCH FOR AMERICAN ENERGY SETTLEMENT AB IF YOU GO IT CETERA -- IN IT INCLUDES WHAT WE KNOW AS AN ESTIMATE TODAY OF THE PRIVATE CHARTERS THAT ARE INSTALLED. IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE GOING FORWARD ESTIMATE OF WHAT ADDITIONAL PRIVATE SHARE CHARGERS WILL GO IN I I SEE SO. SO I I I I INSTALLED A PRIVATE CHARGER IN MY GARAGE IS THAT A LEVEL TUNE IN KNOWN PRIVATE LOCATION THAT'S NOT EVEN KNOW JUST -- SO SOME PEOPLE ONLY CARE PRIVATE SO. IN BY THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN SHARE YOUR CHARGER BUT WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING -- TO WHERE THERE'S ACCESS TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS AND SO THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS MORE LIKE YOU THAT HAVE THEM IN THEIR HOMES THOSE ARE ALSO NOT INCLUDED IN THE COUNTS GOT IT OKAY. SO -- YEAH I THINK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT? SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT HOW. TO HOW TO HOW TO BRIDGE THAT GAP IS IT. IS IT ALL PUBLIC FUNDING IS THERE A WAY TO DO IT WHERE IT'S PUBLIC PRIVATE HOW HOW DO WE KNOW HOW TO HOW DO WE BRIDGE THAT GAP BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THE GAP -- PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN PEOPLE NOT ADOPTING BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET THEIR STAR SO STRESSED HERE NOT NO STRESS ABOUT WOULD LIKE TO GET GAS RIGHT THEY CAN GET GAS EVERYWHERE THERE'S A CONFIDENCE. BUT IF YOU'RE A COMMUNITY. YOU MAY NOT HAVE A GARAGE IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR OWN GARAGE READY OR GIVE A CARPORT OR YOU YOU LIVE IN A APARTMENT COMPLEX. YOU CAN INSTALL A CHARGE OR OR FOR US A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THEY BUILD THE GARAGES OUT SO THEY THEY CHARGE THEIR CARS ON THE NOT ON THIS SORT OF IN THEIR DRIVEWAY. SO -- GET GIVEN THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO SORT OF BUILD OUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE TO REALLY TALK THIS IS TRUE THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS SITUATION THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE OVER HALF A MILLION. CELEBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IF YOU WOULD PREFER THAT TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY CHUCKLE. THE BAD NEWS IS WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THE US IN CALIFORNIA -- AND WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO WE SEE IT AS A AS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO TO MEET THESE GOALS SO. AS YOU KNOW AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN DIRECTS US TO LOOK INTO THIS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE AIRPORT IN THE PC. AND WE STARTED THAT ANALYSIS ALREADY IN TO WE'RE GONNA BE REALLY DIVING INTO THOSE QUESTIONS WELL IN AND AND HOPEFULLY YOUR GAP ANALYSIS IS NOT LOOKING AT THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BETWEEN LOOK AT THE FIVE MILLION BUT IT IS. RIGHT SO IT IS SO WE TOOK IT WE WE WE'VE BEEN PLANNING AGAIN SORT OF THE SNAPSHOT IN TIME OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND ONE POINT. FIVE MILLION -- BUT YES WE WE APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL AS IT SHOULD BE THE LAW AS WELL AS COMMON SENSE SUGGESTS THAT'S TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND IF THINGS CONTINUE TO MOVE THOSE NUMBERS WILL GROW IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TO SUPPORT LARGER NUMBERS. IN IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING BETWEEN THE THREE I USE BETWEEN PW BETWEEN AND RG. IS IT BECAUSE IT THEIR BORDERS AND ENERGY COMMISSION WHO'S. WHO WHO'S SORT OF? MAN I'M ALMOST LIKE BEING THE STATE PLAN ARE RIGHT BECAUSE YOU WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW FIVE FAST CHARGERS IN ONE PLACE AND NO FAST CHARGES IN THIS PLACE. I KNOW ALL UP UNTIL RECENTLY THERE NO FAST CHARGERS ALONG I FIVE WHICH IS WHY NO ONE NO NO AND YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE DON'T DRIVE THEIR EVEY OR THERE WASN'T THAT I THINK IS ONLY A TEST LE FAST CHARGER. BUT PEOPLE DON'T DRIVE THREE BEES BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LA BECAUSE YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW EVEN EVEN IF YOU TRY GAS CARGO FILTER GAS BETWEEN SERVICES CANNELLA SO THINK. WHO SO WHO'S MANAGING THAT OVERALL MAP I GUESS TO TYSON MAYBE HIS BEST AWAY IN FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THIS CONVERSATION BUT I IN SHORT WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN? WORKING ON THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO I I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WERE OFFICIALLY IN OVERTIME NOW -- AND SO IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR RESPONSE BRIEF AND WE'VE GOT TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WAITING TO SPEAK I DON'T MEAN THAT. STEP ON YOUR ON YOUR QUESTION. I HAVE TO I HAVE A TWELVE O'CLOCK AS WELL. I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S A GROUP GROUP SUPPORT HERE RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE STATE OF THE ART COMES OUT TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION WHEN THEY DO THE REPORT IT TO SAY THE RP IN COORDINATION WITH ALL THE OTHER AGENCIES. YOU SEE THERE WORKING ON THE TRANSPORTATION LIKE CHICKEN CATION FRAMEWORK THERE IN COORDINATION WITH THE AGENCIES BUT THERE BE TO SELECT PRIMERICA. THAT WE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND GO BIDS ARE HELPING MAKE SURE THAT ALL THOSE PIECES ARE COMING TOGETHER. SO THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF COOKS IN THE KITCHEN I THINK WE'RE PRETTY WELL COORDINATED CAE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC AND IF YOU KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF AND DEFINITELY UNDER THIRTY SECONDS I'D APPRECIATED AND MS BRASS. HAD A QUESTION SORRY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME THAT WAY? I I KNOW I KNOW I BETTER RECOGNIZE YOU. SORRY ABOUT THAT MS RIGHT. YOU HEARD ME TALKING ABOUT THE THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY WE KNOW THAT. THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- ESPECIALLY IN THE THE FREE CORRIDORS FOR THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. IT'S A BARRIERTO IT IF WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE VEHICLES THERE. SO FREE WE WANT THE VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT'S THE OVER ARCHING INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR THOSE CHARGING FOR THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY -- VEHICLES. YOU WANT. TO AT THE THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER SO RIGHT NOW I THINK THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY MARKET IS REALLY EMERGING WE HAVE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS LIKE THAT ZERO NEAR. ZERO FREIGHT IN ENERGY FACILITIES PROGRAM A. R. B. AS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS GOING. THE IN ABOUT THAT HYDROGEN AND CHARGING AND THEN YOU HAVE THE UTILITIES INVESTING HEAVILY ON THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR IT YOU KNOW FOR BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLE DRIVE TRAIN SAID THIS ONE I THINK WORDS THAT MEAN HEAVY DUTIES IS. EMERGING RIGHT NOW SOARED AB. IN COORDINATION WORKING TOGETHER TO HELP SEE THOSE RIGHT NOW VOTE CATEGORIZE IT MOSTLY AT THE PILOT PHASE. AND THEN SCALE IS VERY CLOSE BEHIND. SO THE PIECE IS AUTHORIZED TO AT TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO INSTALL DC FAST CHARGING STATIONS ALONG TRANSIT QUARTERS. AND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE ACT FAKE ELECTRIFICATION OVERALL. THAT'S PC YEAH FOR THE I USE. THE QUESTION THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING ASKED ABOUT WHO'S. WHO'S THE PLANNER FOR THIS. IT ALMOST BEGS THE QUESTION SHOULDN'T THERE BE -- A PLANNER FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND IF SO. WHAT WOULD BE THE RECOMMENDATION AS TO WHICH DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE THE DEPARTMENT? THAT OVERSEAS AT ALL. WELL I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS THEY GO BAD AS HAS BEEN APPOINTED. TO BE THE COORDINATOR OF ALL THESE THINGS SO I THINK THAT -- AS FAR AS MASTER PLAN THAT'S IT THAT'S MAYBE TOO FAR A STEP TOO FAR IT'S MORE OF A MASTER COORDINATOR IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ALL MAKING DECISIONS IN TANDEM. GOING FORWARD TO REGULAR MEETINGS TO HELP FACILITY THAT AFFECTS. BOTH AT THE TOP AGENCY LEVEL AND THEN AT THE AT THE STAFF LEVEL AS WELL. LAST COMMENT. THIS IS FROM A VERY WISE YOUNG MAN -- WHO SAID TO ME WE ARE JUST TO POINT INFRASTRUCTURE WE'RE CREATING NEW LOCAL ECONOMIES -- MATTHEW HAMLET A YOUNG MAN WHO VERY WISE BEYOND HIS AGE. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AND SO WE'RE BILL BUILDING THE SUPERSTRUCTURE. WE NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE FRENCH QUARTER. WE WANT THOSE DIESEL TRUCKS TO SWITCH OVER THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT UNLESS THEY KNOW THEY CAN MAKE THEIR DELIVERIES. SO I AM LOOKING ORWARD TO FINDING OUT WHO THE MASTER PLANNER IS. COORDINATING I THINK IS. JUST NOT THE SAME THING I THINK HAVING A MASTER PLANNER WHO IS THE ONE THAT RECEIVES THE INFORMATION WHO CAN LOOK AT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FIGURE OUT WHERE THE LIGHT LIGHT DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING IN AND THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD. TO CONTINUING THAT DISCUSSION SO THAT NEXT YEAR WE'RE NOT WONDERING WHO THE PLANNER IS. WILL KNOW WHO THE COORDINATORS I WANT TO KNOW WHO THE PLANNERS NOW. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NO MORE QUESTIONS PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU. HI HANNAH GOLDSMITH DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS DISCUSSION ON INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- REGARDING THE STATE'S ROLE IN ADOPTING POLICIES FOR CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THE NEED FOR BALANCE AND UNDERSCORE THAT THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE RAPID EXPANSION OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. CURRENTLY THE DIVISION OF MEASUREMENT STANDARDS WHICH THAT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD ARE CONSIDERING REGULATIONS WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE RETROFIT. OR MORE LIKELY THE REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING CHARGING STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND WHICH WOULD ADD COSTS TO FUTURE CHARGING STATIONS -- KELLY TO SEE IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH BOTH AGENCIES ON THESE PROPOSALS AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE REGULATIONS AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THE STATE UTILITIES AND OTHERS HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO PUT IN OUR CURRENT NETWORK OF CHARGING STATIONS AND REQUIRING THE REPLACEMENT A RETROFIT. OF THE STATIONS RISKS OURS OF AIR QUALITY CLIMATE AND PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE WHAT KERRY FROM THE CPUC SAID THAT GRANDFATHERING REALLY SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY FOR THESE REGULATIONS. ARE ASK OF YOU IN THIS REGARD IS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY OVERSIGHT OF THESE REGULATORY PROCESS SEES. TO ENSURE THE REGULATIONS WILL NOT HINDER OR REVERSE OUR PROGRESS TO ACHIEVE THE NEEDED LEVELS OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MICHAEL HIMSELF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT STATION JUST WANNA START MY COMMENTS BY THINKING FOLKS HERE FOLKS FROM THE C. Q. C. A. R. B. AND C. C.. R. FOR ALL THEIR GREAT WORK ON TRANSPORTATION LIKE VACATION. I KNOW I'M FOR UNFORTUNATELY WHAT I WANT TO SAY THAT DESPITE ALL THE GREAT PROGRESS IN THE INVESTMENTS ARE BEING MADE -- WERE STILL FALLING SHORT OF WHAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY HIT SCALE I AND THERE'S A QUESTION WITHIN THE STAFF ANALYSIS -- OF WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE OR RATHER -- AUGMENT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL INVEST IN LIGHT DUTY -- VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE BY ALSO INVESTING IN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE I WOULD SAY THAT'S AN UNEQUIVOCAL YES -- FROM THE TRANSIT INDUSTRY SO WE GIVE YOU JUST SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THERE WAS MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CPC'S CONTINUED INVESTMENTS. IN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE TRANSIT INDUSTRY THAT AMOUNTS TO A MINIMUM INVESTMENT OF ABOUT FIFTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S STATEWIDE AND THAT IS CURRENTLY ONE TIME. WE'VE GOT ABOUT TEN THOUSAND VEHICLES THAT NEED TO BE CHARGED -- AND THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING WILL JUST SIMPLY BE INADEQUATE FOR US TO GET THERE AND SO I DO THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A A CONTINUED FOCUS. FROM THE LEGISLATURE MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY. TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION AND I DO THINK THAT IT CAN BE -- PINPOINT IN A FEW KEY AREAS -- LARGELY WITH TRANSIT AGENCIES AND BRINGING THEM TO SCALE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF AGENCIES ARE OPERATING ABOUT A DOZEN TRANSIT BUSES VERY FEW THAT ARE OPERATING ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT. FOR US ACTUALLY PROVE THAT THIS TRANSITION IS IS FEASIBLE AND IT'S A VIABLE WE DIDN'T MAKE SOME INVESTMENTS IN LARGE SCALE. INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT HAS A A BENEFIT NOT ONLY ALLOWING THAT TRANSIT AGENCY TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION TO FULLY ELECTRIFIED THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WILL COME FROM THAT CAN BE PORTED OVER INTO OTHER HEAVY DUTY APPLICATIONS SO AS A MEANS OF KIND OF FOLLOWING A ARBY'S LEAD. OF INVESTING IN TRANSIT AS A BEACH HEAD TECHNOLOGY WE NEED ALSO INVEST IN THE HEAVY DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TRANSIT AS A BEACH HEAD TECHNOLOGY THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO RICHARD CHORE SKI WITH THE EEVEE CHARGING ASSOCIATION -- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE STATE'S TV DEPLOYMENT GOALS WHICH REQUIRE ROBUST NETWORK OF CHARGING STATIONS. AND THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TODAY WITH FUNDING IS HELP MAKE THAT A REALITY AND LEVERAGE A LOT OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT. WE WANT TO STRONGLY ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE CALLIE T. C. WITH REGARD TO THE PENDING DISCUSSION AND POSSIBLE DEPLOYMENTOF STANDARDS. THAT WOULDLIMIT THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT COULD BE AFFORDED IN THE STATE. TODAY STAFF REPORT RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO BALANCE CHARGING STATION TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS WITHOUT OVERLY IMPACTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT. HOWEVER THE AIRPORT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING A REGULATION THAT COULD THREATEN A DECADE OF CHARGING STATION INVESTMENTS AND RESTRICT THE ABILITY THE INDUSTRY'S ABILITY TO DEPLOY MORE INFRASTRUCTURE. WERE ENGAGED IN THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND WILL CONTINUE ENGAGE WITH A A. R. B. STAFF TO ENSURE A BALANCE OF TECHNOLOGY -- AND APPROPRIATE STANDARDS AS A REPORT IDENTIFIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PRAY WITH A PRIME A KELLY ON BEHALF OF CHARGE POINT. THEIR LEADING PROVIDER OF THE V. INFRASTRUCTURE BASED IN CAMPBELL AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE. OF EVEY INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUBLIC ACCESS WHO WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF INSURING THAT PUBLIC ACCESS IS THERE FOR ALL COMMUNITIES. IN INCOME LEVELS I ALSO WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE CPUC CALLIE T. C. AND THE AB CHARGING ASSOCIATION. THAT WE LOOK AT INSURING THAT -- THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES GRANDFATHERED IN AND ON ANY STANDARDS BUT AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO ESTABLISHING PUBLIC ACCESS STANDARDS THERE WERE ALSO MINDFUL OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING. TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS FOR PUBLIC ACCESS AND THE METHODOLOGIES FOR PAYMENT AND THAT WE NOT IN. FOR INTERFERE WITH THAT AND NOT LOOK TO OR RELY ON NINETEEN FIFTIES TECHNOLOGY BUT LOOK FOR TO HELP PAYMENT IS GOING TO GO FORWARD WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND LOOK AND YOUR CONTINUED OVERSIGHT. SURE MEMBERS DANTRELL WITH TOUGH LOVE A ALSO WON A A REPEAT REITERATE -- SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS ONLINE -- OURSELVES WITH THE THEIR CONCERNS -- BEEN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK THE HARD WORK THAT ALL THESE AGENCIES ARE DOING -- ON THE AB INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE IT TRULY IS -- HERCULEAN A CHALLENGE -- ALSO PARTICULAR WANNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO GO BATES AND THEIR EFFORTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERMITTING GUIDE BOOK WHICH REALLY IS INTENDED. TO ALIGN -- WHAT HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL DOWN IN THE WEEDS WITH THE STATE LEVEL GOALS AND AND THAT IS A HUGE HUGE CHALLENGE -- TO ENSURE A HUNDREDS OF OF JURISDICTIONS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT JURISDICTIONS. NOT ONLY HAVE THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES BUT ALSO YOU KNOW ARE ARE AWARE THAT THE STATE LEVEL GOALS ARE IMPORTANT -- TO MEET -- AND LIKE MANY -- PERMITTING -- EFFORTS STREAMLINING EFFORTS THAT YOU HAVE PASSED -- IT'S IT'S THE HIGHER LEVEL -- STAPLES THAT EVERYONE HE'S TAKING CONSIDERATION SO THAT THE WORK THE GOV IS DOING IS TRULY INVALUABLE REALLY APPRECIATE THE THE THE HARDWORKING TIME THE PUTTING THAT THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS THE INFORMATION NOT ONLY ITEM SO WE'LL BRING THAT ONE TO A CLOSE THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. WILL MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE THREE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE RAPIDLY THROUGH THE REST OF THE AGENDA BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE. PLACES TO GO AND PEOPLE TO ME -- AND WE'RE GONNA. WE'RE GONNA LOSE MEMBERS RAPIDLY FREE. TO MOVE THINGS ALONG SO IF WE COULD -- IS IT POSSIBLE TO COMBINE ISSUES THREE AND FOUR AT ONE LOCATION TATIAN THAT BE GREAT AND THEN WE'LL TAKE. QUESTIONS AND PUBLIC COMMENT AND TO SEE IF WE CAN'T GET A MOTION ON THE TABLE. OKAY WHAT IT SAID THAT I AM ET CHIANG FROM THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND SAID THESE THESE ARE ISSUES THREE AND FOUR TOGETHER. SO IS ABOUT TO CHANGE PROPOSAL -- FOR SB ONE IMPLEMENTATION AND ALSO FOR THE TRUCK ONE PROGRAM. SO ON THE TRUCK AS A MINISTER WITH THE TRUCK LOAN PROGRAM ACTUALLY -- START WITH WE HAVE A TRUCK AND BUS REGULATION AND WITH THIS REGULATION DOES IS IT CLEANS UP THE EXISTING ON ROAD TRUCK AND BUS FLEET IT PROVIDES IMMEDIATE AIR QUALITY BENEFITS. ESPECIALLY TO COMMUNITIES AT OR NEAR BUSY ROADWAYS AND FREIGHT HUBS. SB ONE CONTAINS A PROVISION THAT STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY DMV HAS TO VERIFY THE TRUCKS MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TRUCK AND BUS REGULATION. BEFORE REGISTRATION IS ISSUED SO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE PEOPLE'S -- CONTACTING OF AIR BEAT TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REGULATION WHAT THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE. AND ALSO IT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE DRAW ON THIS TRUCK LOAN PROGRAM ON THE TRUCK ONE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED IN COORDINATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY. IT BASICALLY USES PUBLIC FUNDING -- AND LEVERAGES PRIVATE FUNDING SO THAT FLEET OWNERS THEY CAN'T GET A LOAN USING CONVENTIONAL LOAN CRITERIA ARE ABLE TO QUALIFY BECAUSE THE LOAN IS BACKED BY THE STATE. I'M WE'RE ASKING FOR AN AUGMENTATION OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THAT WOULD BRING THE TOTAL ASSISTANCE TO FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS N THAT FISCAL YEAR AND WILL COVER LOANS FOR ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND TRUCKS. THIS IS A REALLY KEY COMPONENT OF HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES COMPLY WITH THE TRUCK AND BUS REGULATION -- ESPECIALLY BEFORE THESE SB ONE REQUIRE ITS HEAD. I'M SB ONE HAS -- I'VE TALKED ABOUT SORT OF ONE OF THE PRIMARY PIECES OF IT THE OTHER TWO PIECES THAT AFFECTS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. WERE REQUIRED TO DO YOU AN EMISSIONS ANALYSIS OF ON THE OF THE MISSION COMPONENTS UNDER SB ONE AND THERE WERE ALSO REQUIRED TO COORDINATE WITH CALTRANS NCTC. ON GRANT GUIDELINES -- SO UNDER THE ISSUE FOR WERE ASKING FOR THIRTEEN THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM POSITIONS FOR COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE AND ENFORCEMENT. ONE THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM POSITION FOR THE EMISSIONS ANALYSIS AND THEN ONE PERMANENT POSITION FOR DEVELOPING PLANNING GRANT GUIDELINES AND CONSULTATION WITH THE CDC AND CALTRANS. I'M GONNA LEAVE IT THERE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL THANK YOU QUESTIONS SO ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM ALEJO. FINANCE -- IS THERE PUBLIC COMMENT ON EITHER OF THESE ITEMS. AND IT WOULD THAT BE ISSUES THREE AND FOUR WITH WONDERFUL. WERE GONNA TAKE THESE UP SEPARATELY AFRICA NO NOT MY FAULT FOR NOT REMEMBERING -- SO NUMBER. THREE WAS THERE A SECOND. WITH. WILLIAM HI. FONG [inaudible] GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON RAY S. [inaudible] REAVIS HIGH. GREAT SERVICE M. MOST ON ISSUE FOR SECOND. BLOOM HI FONG [inaudible] GARCIA MULLIN [inaudible] PATTERSON RADIUS [inaudible] REVERSED. GREAT THAT COMPLETES ISSUES THREE AND FOUR WILL MOVE ON TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND ISSUES FIVE SIX AND SEVEN WE HAVE -- A ISSUE FIVE IS A RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD OPEN -- WELCOME LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR BRIEF [inaudible] DISCUSSION.

THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST EIGHT PERMANENT POSITIONS PLUS LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THREE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE. THAT SUPPORT THE CPUC. AS HIGHLIGHTED IN STAFF COMMENTS RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE CPUC HAVE EXPANDED OVER THE YEARS AS A RESULT OF THE NEW MANDATES. PROGRAMS AND GOALS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF HAVE NOT GROWN IN HARMONY WITH THIS EXPANSION. THEREFORE WE ARE REQUESTING THIS AUGMENTATION TO PROVIDE THE SEED P. YOU SEE WITH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

POURTANT TO BE PROVIDED I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE HELD OPEN BUT I THINK THAT THAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED. WHAT WE WOULD COUNTERED AT THE CPUC HAS BEEN -- BOTH INJURIES ILLNESS AND A LACK OF AN APPROPRIATE STAFFING FOR MANDATED -- ACTIVITIES SUCH AS A MONTHLY REPORTING -- TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE CONSTRAINTS OF OUR CURRENT STAFFING DON'T ALLOW US TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO FINANCE IN LA -- AS WE WOULD LIKE TO WE WOULD PREFER TO DO A BETTER JOB IN THE FUTURE. YOU SAY INJURIES AND ILLNESS. SO ARE THEY OUT. THEY'RE INJURED OR THEIR ILL AND THEY'RE OUT OF WORK -- WE'VE HAD DOES SOME OF LIMITED ABILITY -- TO HAVE STAFF IN THE OFFICE DO THESE SITUATIONS AND WE HAVE NO VACANCIES SO WE CANNOT FILL BEHIND THEM.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON ESSAY -- AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED SB SIXTY TWO CREATING P. UC CODE THREE OH NINE THAT EIGHT ESTABLISHING A DIRECT YOU KNOW SAY TO AMONG OTHER THINGS. RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES SAFETY MANAGEMENT SAFETY CULTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CITY UC'S OWN SAFETY MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY CULTURE IN ITS OVERSIGHT OF UTILITIES. AS AN ADVISORY ROLE TO THE COMMISSION AN ADVOCATE AS A PARTY IN PROCEEDINGS TO ASSIST THE COMMISSION. IN ITS EFFORTS TO HOLD PUBLIC I'M SORRY JUST. PUBLIC UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR SAFE OPERATION IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ESSAY RECOMMENDED ADVOCATED AND PROMOTED SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS OVER BROAD RANGE INSPECTION OF UTILITY PROGRAMS INCLUDING ELECTRIC WILDFIRE GAS PIPELINE AND GAS STORAGE -- ALWAYS SAY CURRENTLY IS COMPRISED OF FOUR SENIOR ENGINEERS AND THREE SENIOR ANALYST WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD STAFF LOCATED IN EACH OF THE P. UC'S. SACRAMENTO LA AND SAN FRANCISCO OFFICES IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN OVER A DOZEN PROCEEDINGS AT THE COMMISSION. AND PER P.

THANK YOU OUR FINAL ITEM IS -- ISSUE NUMBER -- SEVEN PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THIS IS A HOLD OPEN -- RECOMMENDATIONS -- IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR PRESENTATION AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE WE WOULD APPRECIATE I WILL TRY MY BEST. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LINDA CEREZO AND I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AND WITH ME HERE TODAY IS CHLOE LUKENS SHE'S UP PROGRAM MANAGER OVER ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE MATTERS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR BUDGET REQUEST WE ARE REQUESTING THREE POSITIONS TO WORK N ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES. ARE INFRASTRUCTURE WORK OF BREAKS DOWN PRIMARILY INTO TWO AREAS DISTRIBUTION PLANNING. AND TRANSMISSION PLANNING AND PERMITTING -- WITH RESPECT TO NEW AN ON GOING WORK AND ARE REQUESTING ONE ENGINEER POSITION. STARTING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DISTRIBUTION PLANNING BECAME AN ANNUAL AN ON GOING PROCESS THAT ENTAILS REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX TECHNICAL DATA. FOR EXAMPLE EVERY YEAR EACH UTILITY WILL PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OTHER USE THEIR SYSTEMS CAPACITY. FORECASTS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND ON THE SYSTEMS AND IDENTIFY AREAS THAT REQUIRE UPGRADES FOR CHANGES. UTILITIES ALSO WHAT IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR SYSTEM UPGRADES AND NEW CONSTRUCTION THAT COULD BE DEFERRED WITH DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES JUST SUCH AS SOLAR AND STORAGE. WE REVIEW ALL THIS INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE UTILITIES PLANTS AFFECTIVELY ENSURE RELIABILITY. AND ARE COST EFFECTIVE THIS POSITION WILL ENABLE US TO ADDRESS THIS NEW WORKLOAD. NOW I'D LIKE TO SWITCH OVER TO THE TRANSMISSION SIDE OF INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'RE REQUESTING ONE ENGINEER POSITION AND ONE ATTORNEY POSITION TO FOCUS ON INCREASING AN ONGOING TRANSMISSION PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND PERMITTING APPLICATIONS. TO ADDRESS CONGESTION AND RELIABILITY ISSUES. BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WE EXPECT FOURTEEN NEW APPLICATIONS FOR TRANSMISSION UPGRADES OR NEW CONSTRUCTION TO BE FILED AT THE PC. THIS IS ON TOP OF APPLICATIONS ABOUT LAST YEAR THAT ARE STILL BEING LITIGATED THAT THE CPUC. IN ADDITION THE UTILITIES WILL FILE ADVICE LITERATURE SMALLER TRIP SMALLER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS WHICH WE MUST ALSO ANALYZE. AS YOU KNOW TRANSMISSION PROJECTS ARE EXPENSIVE. AND THE UTILITIES TYPICALLY REQUEST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COST RECOVERY FROM RATEPAYERS. WE ARE OFTEN THE ONLY PARTY ASIDE FROM THE UTILITY PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROCEEDINGS WE CAN TALK COMP COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS TO ENSURE THAT TRANSMISSION PROJECTS ARE NEEDED. THAT COSTS ARE REASONABLE AND WHERE POSSIBLE IDENTIFY COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES. THESE TWO POSITIONS WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THIS INCREASED WORKLOAD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND A WHAT WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THE QUESTIONS POSED IN THE US STAFF REPORT IS -- I THINK -- BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHY WERE THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL -- WELL WHEN WHEN -- YOU ORIGINALLY REQUESTED POSITIONS TWO YEARS AGO YES -- CAN YOU -- RESPONDED THAT AGAIN. BACK TO TWO YEARS AGO WE OF THE COMMISSION AND STAKEHOLDERS WERE JUST STARTING TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IS INVOLVED IN DISTRIBUTION PLANNING -- IN PARTICULAR IT'S A NEW AREA AND AND THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WAS NEVER. BUILT TO TAKE ON THOUSANDS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES STORAGE SOLAR SO IT REALLY. AT THAT TIME IT WAS NOT ANTICIPATED THAT THE TYPE OF OF THE BEGINNING OF THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WHEN IT WAS BUILT IN FACT IT JUST NEVER WAS DESIGNED TO TO TO TAKE ON THAT KIND OF OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARE INVOLVED. WITH THESE SYSTEMS LOAD ETCETERA SO IT REALLY ENTAILS A LOT OF ENGINEERING ANALYSIS AND IT'S PRETTY COMPLEX TO MAKE SURE THAT SERVICES RELIABLE AND SAFE. AND COST EFFECTIVE AS WELL SO IT'S JUST THIS IS THIS IS A VERY NEW TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS UTILITIES WHAT THE UTILITIES COMPLAINING OTHER SYSTEMS FOR A LONG TIME BUT IN TERMS OF STAKEHOLDERS -- SUCH AS THOSE WHO WON IN A CONNECT TO THE SYSTEM NOW STORAGE PROVIDERS. AGAIN SOLAR -- ELECTRIC VEHICLES IT JUST IT REQUIRES A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF PLANNING AND IT'S IT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION THAT YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING. THAT JUST HAVE AN IDEA OF THE IMPACT SO WE HAVE ABOUT -- EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND SO THE ROOFTOP OF A TAKES -- INTER CONNECTED RIGHT NOW TO THE GRID AND THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF DEMAND -- WE ALSO IF IT'S ESTIMATED WHEN WE HAVE THREE POINT NINE THREE POINT NINE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES INTER CONNECTED INTO THE TO THE DISTRIBUTION GRID THAT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT 5% OF CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL -- ANNUAL LOAD SO AS YOU'RE GETTING A FEEL THE SYSTEMS BECOMING MORE DYNAMIC AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO FORECAST PLAN FOR FOR THIS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S RELIABLE -- WE NEED -- TO ALSO AS WHEN IT WAS SAYING THE COMMUNICATION -- YOU KNOW IT WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POINTS -- OF GENERATION NOW AND TOOK ACTING TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TO CREATE DIFFERENT BACK I GOT IT THANK THANK YOU -- FOR THE EXPLANATION. THAT'S HELPFUL ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS PUBLIC COMMENT -- FINANCE AND LA -- YOU'RE GOOD. THEN -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN THAT BRINGS US TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MEETING WE HAVE HAD ON VOTES FROM AT LEAST ONE MEMBER -- AND WILL DO THIS NOW. YOU CAN JUST CALL THE MINT. SO THIS IS ON THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR ISSUES. 246-910-1317 EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY THE MOTION WAS TO PROVE THESE ITEMS FONG. AND THEN WE'LL TAKE THIS UP SEPARATELY. ISSUE NUMBER ONE THE MOTION WAS TO APPROVE [inaudible] FONG. ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE MOTION WAS TO APPROVE FONG. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE MOTION TO APPROVE FONG. ISSUE SEVEN MOTION TO APPROVE FONG. ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT MOTION TO APPROVE FONG. ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN THE MOTION WAS TO APPROVE FONG [inaudible] OKAY. ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE THE MOTION WAS TO PROVE FONG. ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN MOTION TO APPROVE FONG. ISSUE FIFTEEN MOTION TO APPROVE FONG. AN ISSUE SIXTEEN MOTION TO APPROVE FONG [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT BRINGS THE MEETING TO A CONCLUSION AND WE ARE ADJOURNED. THANKS EVERYBODY [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] WELL [inaudible] YEAH
