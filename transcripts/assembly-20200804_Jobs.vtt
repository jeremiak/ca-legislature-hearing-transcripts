FAIRLY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH-

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:09.733
THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN HOW.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.369
SOME FOLKS HAVE USED THE LAW TO

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:14.138
LARGELY AFFECT SOCIAL CHANGE

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:16.840

TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT. IT'S

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:39.663
CLEAR I THINK WE HAD A COUPLE

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.199

FIRST TO SAY THAT THE COMMITTEE

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.922
AMENDMENTS NOW INCLUDES

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:07.090

OPPOSED TO HEALTH SAFETY OR

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:14.264
ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT. SO TO THE

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:16.833

WHETHER THEY'RE IN SUPPORT OR

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:41.191
OPPOSITION BUT I THINK THERE

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:43.327
MAY HAVE BEEN A SITUATION HERE

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:44.528
WHERE MAYBE THERE WAS AN

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:46.330

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:01.144
TAKING AWAY AUTHORITY FROM ANY

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.879
STATE AGENCY IN FACT WE'RE

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:06.083
GIVING THEM. AUTHORITY IF THEY

00:48:06.149 --> 00:48:09.686
CHOOSE NOT TO BOB EVALUATE ON

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:12.022
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A GIVEN

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:14.558
MATTER. THAT'S THAT'S THEIR

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:15.092

THE SUGGESTION NOT AT ALL AND

00:48:32.876 --> 00:48:34.778

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:46.770
IN PLACE THAT WILL SATISFY- A

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:49.706
DISCRETIONARY MEAT. SO THEY

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.608
THEY MAY VERY WELL NOT HAVE TO

00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:54.177
DO TOO MUCH OF REPORT- AT ALL

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:57.214
BUT THE BOARD CALIFORNIA WE

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.648
HAVE SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:01.151
BEAR ON SMALL BUSINESS I THINK

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:02.986
IT'S APPROPRIATE. ALL OF THEM

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:05.121
AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. DEVISE

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:07.557
A PLAN THAT WOULD EVALUATE

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:08.425
WHETHER OR NOT DEPARTMENT HEADS

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:10.293
SHOULD BEAR ON THE

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.696
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE IMPOSITION

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:15.899

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:20.070
ADDITIONAL CO AUTHORS ARE CAN

00:52:20.136 --> 00:52:22.806

HAVING ONE WAS ABSENT IN THE

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:33.316
SENATE THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL.

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:33.884

WHETHER THEY'RE THEY'RE- PHONE

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:49.099
OR WHETHER THEY'RE A- OTHER

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:51.835
TYPES OF A ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

00:52:51.902 --> 00:52:54.838
START UPS. AND WE NEED TO PUT

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:57.707
OUR ARMS AROUND- THE CALIFORNIA

00:52:57.774 --> 00:52:59.409
ECONOMY BECAUSE WE ARE. GOING

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:00.477

ESTABLISHES THAT THE ACTION WAS

00:53:13.456 --> 00:53:15.292
NOT WILLFUL NEGLIGENT ARE

00:53:15.358 --> 00:53:16.927
HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT WE

00:53:16.993 --> 00:53:19.729
HAD OPPONENTS TO FIVE. IT COULD

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:22.165
BE IN THAT KIND OF DETERMINE

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.199
THE BEST A THAT'S A FANTASTIC

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:24.868
QUESTION THE BEAUTY OF THIS

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:27.237
PROPOSED LEGISLATION IS THAT IT

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:29.372
IS GIVING THE AUTHORITY TO THE

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:31.541
RELEVANT DEPARTMENT. AT THAT

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:32.676
DEPARTMENT WHETHER IT BE A

00:53:32.742 --> 00:53:34.344
DEPARTMENT HEAD OR WHETHER BE A

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:36.546
TEAM- WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:39.015
ITSELF AS THEY PUT FORWARD

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:42.152
THEIR OWN AND- THAT WILL ALLOW

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:43.420
FOR A REVIEW. BY MATT IT'S

00:53:43.486 --> 00:53:46.089

AND IS THERE A CATEGORY OF

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:58.802
PENALTIES THAT CURRENTLY DOES

00:53:58.868 --> 00:53:59.336

OPPONENTS PER OUT THAT A LOT

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:04.441
OF- PENALTIES HAVE DISCRETION

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.109

STATUTORY WORDING GIVE SOME

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.455
DISCRETION WITHIN THAT RESOLVES

00:54:52.522 --> 00:54:54.724
THAT IN THE INSTANCES OF IT

00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:55.992
MEANT THAT MEET HE DOESN'T HAVE

STATUTORY REGULATORY AUTHORITY

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.197
TO USE ITS DISCRETION THE MAP

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:03.867
WHEN I IS WHEN I THINK IT WOULD

00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:09.205
BE ACTIVATED THIRTY WHAT'S THAT.

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:10.640
RUN THROUGH. THE FORMULA HE

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:14.344

00:55:14.411 --> 00:55:18.515
YEAR AROUND A BILL- ON AND-

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:20.083
THAT REALLY LOOKED AT

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.917
SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:22.485
I'VE HAD TWO SMALL BUSINESSES

00:55:22.552 --> 00:55:24.421
SO I'M ONE OF THOSE MOM POP SO

00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:25.822
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:28.258
PRESSURES OF CALIFORNIA. LABOR

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:30.093
CODES- AS THEY APPLY SMALL

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.062
BUSINESSES. GUESS WHERE I

00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:35.999
STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL IS. IN

00:55:36.066 --> 00:55:36.633
THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC. OUR

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.468
BUSINESSES NEED HELP NOW YOU

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:40.036
AND YOUR BILL USE OF TAXPAYER

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:42.138
MONEY NOW FOR SOMETHING DOWN

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:44.407
THE ROAD THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:46.209
NECESSARY WE DON'T KNOW THE

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:48.211
CATEGORY OF. OUR AGENCIES THEY

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.746
HAVE DISCRETION. AND I KIND OF

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:51.247
THINK AS AS AND SUPPORTING

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:55.051
SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW IN

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:55.618
MY MIND THE WORLD IS ON FIRE

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:57.721
AND WE NEED TO BE YOURSELF NOW.

00:55:57.787 --> 00:55:59.789
AND IT CHALLENGING TO SUPPORT A

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:02.258
POLICY. THAT USES MY DIVERTS

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:05.261
MONEY FROM SMALL BUSINESSES NOW

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:06.663
TO THIS OTHER THING ON THE

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.099
ROAD. I CAN'T THINK WHAT WE

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:10.900
SHOULD BE DOING. REALLY

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:13.002
EDUCATING OUR SMALL THE SPECIAL

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:14.471
MICHAEL BUSINESSES I THINK THE

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:18.441
OF THE TWENTY N. UNDERS ARE THE

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:20.143
ONES I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT. A

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:23.213
CITY. YEAH I KNOW WE'VE DONE

00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:25.248
SEVERAL. I'M NOT WE DO I THINK

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:26.750
WOULD BE HELPFUL AT AND BETTER

00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:28.485
OF TAX MONEY SO I GONNA PUT

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:31.020
STAY OFF TODAY BUT APPRECIATE

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:33.256
THE EFFORTS IN AND ACTUALLY

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:34.624
THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.793
SMALL BUSINESSES. HE IF I MAY.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.628
THE CHECK YOU BRING SME VERY

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:41.564
IMPORTANT POINTS- THE ORIGINAL

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:42.398
DRAFTING OF THIS WHEN I WENT

00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:44.434
THROUGH THE SENATE I HAD AN

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:46.469
APPROPRIATION. AND IN

00:56:46.536 --> 00:56:48.671
CONSULTATION WITH THE WITH WITH

00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:50.540
LEADERSHIP AND BASED ON THE

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:52.375
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE MOST

00:56:52.442 --> 00:56:54.177
OBVIOUS. WE REALIZE THAT

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:55.912
CALIFORNIA'S ON IN A FINANCIAL

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.547
POSITION RIGHT NOW. BUT I THINK

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:59.749
WHAT'S WAIT WHILE WE CAN

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:02.986
DISSIPATE THE RECOVERY IS WHAT

00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:04.387
TAKE A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME. SO

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:06.589
THIS BILL DOES THAT. DOES NOT

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:08.925
ACTUALLY HAVE AN APPROPRIATION

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:12.061
ATTACHED TO IT. IT IS DESIGNED

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:13.897
IN ITS IN ITS FORM NOW THERE IS

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:16.332
NO PREPARATION ATTACHED TO THIS

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:19.702
THIS IS THE FRAMEWORK. AND AS-

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:21.938
THINGS MOVE FORWARD- I'M

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:24.240
HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL I DO

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:25.775
DEEPER DIVES AND WE'RE

00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:27.443
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES CAN

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.780
EXIST IN THE FUTURE- AND THEN.

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:33.817
CREATE THESE- CREATE THESE

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:36.519
DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT- SELF

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:40.657
REVIEWS AND SELF PROPOSALS- BUT
