THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN WOULD AND MEMBERS ARE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB SEVEN EIGHTEEN IF A SIMPLE BILL TO CONTINUE A SUCCESSFUL ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLAN. THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR ALMOST A DECADE FOR THE STATE'S BIOTECH INDUSTRY. SMALL BIOTECH COMPANIES MUST COMPETE FOR SCIENTISTS AMONG THE LARGE WELL ESTABLISHED COMPANIES. SB SEVEN EIGHTEEN WAS INTRODUCED TO ENSURE THAT THE SMALL COMPANIES CAN DO JUST THAT. INDEED ENABLE FOR BIOTECH ASSOCIATION HEALTH PAN TO CONTINUE. BIOTERROR AS YOU KNOW IS UNIQUELY CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA IT HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER FROM THE DEVASTATION OF THE COVE A PANDEMIC. DUE TO ITS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY RESEARCH THOSE SCIENTISTS AND THEIR SUPPORT TEAMS WHO HAVE BEEN LABORED TO BRING US. THESE INNOVATIONS DESERVE THE BEST HEALTH CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE JUST THAT. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ADDISON SAID IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. PLATINUM QUALITY HEALTHCARE TO BUY TECH EMPLOYEES AND BUILD A STRONGER BIOTECH INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH VIACOM CALIFORNIA AND THE LEGISLATURE. SO THIS HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE PROGRAM CAN CONTINUE LONG INTO THE FUTURE. WITH ME TODAY OR TOMORROW TOP REPRESENTING VIACOM CALIFORNIA AND TODD BENNETT WITH MARSH AND MCLENNAN INSURANCE AGENCY THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE BIO CONTRAST TO PRESENT THEIR COMMENTS AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO SENATOR BATES I WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY- TO OUR MODERATOR. AFTERNOON OUR DOCTOR WOULDN'T MEMBERS I AM ONLY ROOFTOP HERE ON BEHALF OF CAL FIRE CONTROL FORMULA THE SPONSORS OF SB SEVEN EIGHTEEN. WE ARE STATEWIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION OF LIFE SCIENCE COMPANIES. THE LIFE SCIENCE INDUSTRY IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S TRUE HOME GROWN INDUSTRIES. WHILE MANY THINK OF THE LARGE WELL ESTABLISHED COMPANIES IN THIS SPACE. IT IS THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES THAT HELP DRIVE MEDICAL DISCOVERY. SOMETHING WE HAVE ALL SEEN FIRST HAND. WHAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CODED VACCINES WHICH BEGAN EXPRESSING IDEAS AND SMALLER BIOTECH COMPANIES. HOWEVER THESE COMPANIES MUST COMPETE WITH THE LARGER COMPANIES FOR TALENT AT ALL LEVELS. BECAUSE THEY OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKET THEY MUST OFFER HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE PLAN TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT TOP QUALITY TALENT. TO ADDRESS HIS NEED BY A COMMA ESTABLISHED A HEALTH CARE TRACK. SPECIFICALLY FOR ITS SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED LIFE SCIENCE COMPANIES. IT'S BENEFITS ARE HIGH QUALITY AND ARE AVAILABLE TO NOT JUST THE MOST EXPERIENCED SCIENTISTS BUT TO ALL THE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN ENROLLED COMPANY INCLUDING ENTRY LEVEL CLERKS AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT. OUR PLAN PREDATED THE FULL ROLLOUT OF THE ACA. AND NEED HELP PLANTS HAVE BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AS FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE PLAN THIS ENTIRE TIME. WE RECOGNIZED THE CONCERN ABOUT CERTAIN ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLAN ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT PROVIDE SUBPAR INSURANCE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES OR ARE NOT FULLY INSURED. WHICH IS WHY SB SEVEN EIGHTEEN WHICH CRAFTED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED. IT IS OFTEN NARROWLY CRAFTED TO ENSURE THAT IT WOULD NOT RESULT IN ANY FLIGHT FROM THE SMALL EMPLOYER GROUP MARKET. SO ON BEHALF OF THE DIVERSE WORKFORCE THE CALIFORNIA MODEL IN MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES WITHIN THE BY A CONTRACT. WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CONNECT ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WOULD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TODD BENNETT AND I'M HERE TO REPRESENT THE BEYOND BENEFITS TRUST AND SHARE SOME IMPORTANT MECHANICS OF THE PROGRAM. FIRST MUCH LIKE SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA. STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE BUILT INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THE ON BENEFITS. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO OFFER A VERY STABLE PROGRAM% TO LIVE. THE LIFE SCIENCES AND BIOTECH PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS. THIS INDUSTRY DEMANDS THE MOST TALENTED MINDS AND THEREFORE EMPLOYERS DESIRE TO OFFER RICH BENEFITS. THAT MEET AND EXCEED COVERAGE FOR BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT. WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN ALL THE PLANS OFFERED THROUGH THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE CLAIMS DATA IS PROVIDED IN THE DE IDENTIFIED AGGREGATE FORMAT IT'S NOT MADE AVAILABLE FOR EACH SEPARATE EMPLOYER OR INDIVIDUAL AND BEYOND BENEFITS. THEREFORE WE CAN'T CHERRY PICK WHICH EMPLOYERS JOINT BEYOND THAT. WE ALSO CAN'T REQUIRE THEM TO LEAVE THE PROGRAM BASED ON HEALTH STATUS. ON ADULT STATUS OF THEIR EMPLOYEE POPULATION. AND ONE UNIFORMITY WILL IS PROVIDED TO ALL EMPLOYERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR COMPANIES HEALTH STATUS. EVEN AS A FULLY INSURED PROGRAM WHERE THE CARRIER HOLDS ALL THE RICH BEYOND BENEFITS HAS BEEN SAVVY ENOUGH TO BUILD A RESERVE. WHICH WE CAN USE TO HELP OFFSET FUTURE ANNUAL INCREASES FOR THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE. TO FURTHER BENEFIT PARTICIPANTS THE BEYOND BENEFITS TRUST HAS SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATED STREAMLINED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN COMPARISON. TO THE TRADITIONAL INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. AND CONSISTENTLY LOWER THAN TRAINED RENEWALS. IN ROMAN FROM SMALL GROUP EMPLOYERS AND BEYOND BENEFITS REPRESENTS JUST ONE HALF OF A PERCENT OF THE TWO POINT THREE MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND CALIFORNIA SMALL GROUP INSURANCE MARKETS. ALLOWING THE PROGRAM TO CONTINUE WILL ALLOW YOU IT WILL ALLOW US ALL TO HELP SOLVE THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THIS INDUSTRY. OFFERING THIS PROGRAM STATISTICALLY AND ACTUARIALLY DOES NOT DESTABILIZE THE EXISTING INSURANCE MARKET NOR DOES THE DEBATE THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO US ALL. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE.

I THINK SB THREE EIGHTIES GONNA TAKE LONGER THAN FIVE MINUTES BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A- ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT- MIGHT BE A LITTLE SHORTER DURATION WE'RE HAPPY TO BUT YOU GO AHEAD. CERTAINLY'S MISTER CHAIR CAN YOU CAN USE SUGGEST WHICH ONE MIGHT BE THE SHORTEST- WELL I YOU KNOW I THINK SB FOUR SIXTY FIVE IS A GREAT CANDIDATE ALL RIGHT LET'S DO THAT THEN. THINKPAD GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS NICE TO SEE EVERYBODY OVER HERE- TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP FOUR SIXTY FIVE- WE CAME INTO THIS YEAR WITH AN INTENTIONAL FOCUS ON SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS AND OF COURSE SOME OF THOSE BEING- MENTAL HEALTH. AND HOW WE TREAT THAT AND HOW WE ARE FUNDING ALL OF THAT. A ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO THAT IS THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE AT THE- AT THE MOST HIGH LEVEL OF NEED WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED A FULL. FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP- SO AND THAT IS WHAT KIND OF IT BUT WHATEVER IT TAKES- METHODOLOGY. TREATMENT MODEL TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH FOLKS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE START TO REALIZE THOUGH IS THAT THAT MAYBE OUR OUTCOMES ARE VERY GOOD WITH THIS AND WE'RE NOT. KEEPING VERY GOOD TRACK. OF THAT SO THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THE COMMISSION THERE'S AN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. THAT OVERSEES ALL OF THAT AND AS WE KNOW THERE'S MULTIPLE SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT COMES INTO OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS VERY HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE. WHAT IS ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE WHAT IS NOT- WHERE IS A GOOD USE OF MONEY WHERE IS PERHAPS NOT. AT SO THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE HOW MANY OF THOSE. SERVED BY THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS EXPERIENCE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WHY INDIVIDUAL SEPARATE FROM THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND WHAT SERVICES THEY RECEIVED. IT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO REPORT TO INCLUDE THE DEGREE TO WHICH- THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS ARE ACCESSING THIS THE SERVICES AND WHAT BARRIERS THE COMMISSION MIGHT BE ABLE TO. IDENTIFY THAT TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO. REALLY SET OUR COURSE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND FOCUSING ON WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS TO BE ABLE TO USE OUR- OF PUBLIC. AND PRIVATE MONEY THE MOST EFFECTIVELY- THAT WE PASSED THE SO THE SENATE WITH THE UNANIMOUS AND BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- AND TO WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS RANDALL HAGAR REPRESENTING THE PSYCHIATRIC. PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA. AND TOBY TOBY YOU IN WHO IS BIG THAT DIRECTOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNT. COMMISSION VERY MUCH VERY REV THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR- WOULD GO AHEAD TO THE PHONE LINES FOR OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I WILL NOTE THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY REGISTERED WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER MAIENSCHEIN AND THE SECOND BY I MISS AGUIAR-CURRY SO PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS RANDALL HAGER REPRESENTING THE PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE A CALIFORNIA- I THINK- CINDER EGGMAN GAVE THE CONCEPT VERY WELL THIS ONE UNDER. COUPLE POINTS- YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL THAT. KIND OF A CORE PIECE OF MANY COUNTY SERVICES ARE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND ARE ACTUALLY BASED ON. THE ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT MODEL WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST STUDIED MODELS IN THE HISTORY OF COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH. IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR FIFTY YEARS. AND WITH MANY POPULATIONS IN DIFFERENT TREATMENT CONTACTS USING IT WITH PEOPLE HE HAS ABUSED DRUGS AS WELL AS THOSE REMAIN THE L. YOU CAN GET VERY EXCELLENT. OUTCOMES AND- PUTTING IT VERY SIMPLY IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO WORK THE MODEL TO GET THE OUTCOMES. AND AS SENATOR EGGMAN HAS HAS INDICATED WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE IF THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE. A SYSTEMATIC WAY OF MEASURING- AND COLLECTING DATA AND REPORTING THOSE OUT COMES OUT. SO IF YOU CAN DO THAT AND THEN YOU CAN ACHIEVE COULD FIDELITY YOU'LL GET BETTER RESULTS. AND SO WHILE IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS BY 50% WHAT ABOUT SIXTY SEVENTY OR EVEN EIGHTY PERCENT. THAT'S WHAT THE POWER IN THIS DATA- THAT WERE ABOUT TO COLLECT WE HOPE TO COLLECT. BOB CAN DO AND SO WE RECOMMEND THIS MEASURE TO YOU VERY HIGHLY FOR THAT REASON THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS. MR YOU IN. DEBT GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS TOBY DOING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. HI TWO ONE AT WHEN I THINK CENTER EGGMAN FOR LEADERSHIP ON THIS. S. B. FOUR SIX FIVE WOULD REALLY STRENGTHEN ATTENTION ON CALIFORNIA'S FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS- AS I THINK AS YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ALONG WITH THE COMMISSION HAS AN OVERSIGHT ROLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC FUNDS IT REFUSING TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH. ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY AT ACHIEVING KIND ABOUT COMES THE ROLE LOOKING. FOR- THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SOMETHING. IT TO FOR SERVER PAR FULL PARTNERSHIP AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THESE PROGRAM ARE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA. THEY PAIR SEVERAL CORE VALUES VALUES OF RECOVERY. RESPECT FOR THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONSUMERS WHICH IS WHY THESE PROGRAMS ARE CALLED PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE THEY'RE A PARTNERSHIP BUILT BETWEEN THE SERVICE PROVIDER AN INDIVIDUAL BEING SERVED. AND THEY REALLY BRING THIS WHATEVER IT TAKES APPROACH WHICH IS- WHICH RESEARCHES DEMONSTRATED CAN HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE A FORMER COMMISSIONER RICHARD VAN HORN WHO PASSED AWAY LAST WEEK HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL. IN HELPING TO BRING THIS MODEL. INTO FRUITION IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH WITH THESE PROGRAMS. NOT ONLY ARE WE SPENDING UPWARDS OF A BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR ON THESE PROGRAMS. THERE THEM THE MOST CONCERTED INVESTMENT WE'RE MAKING TO REDUCE JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT TO REDUCE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. AMONG THE MANY CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING REDUCING PRESSURE ON OUR STATE HOSPITALS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE ON HOUSING AND REDUCING CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS OFFER THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY ADDRESS THAT AND WE KNOW MANY OF THEM ARE WORKING VERY WELL. THE BILL WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND BETTER WHICH PROGRAMS ARE WORKING AND WHY SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE FOCUSED IN AND IN SUPPORTING. OUR COUNTY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ENSURE WE'RE DELIVERING CARE TODAY'S MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS IN WAYS THAT ARE BOTH EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY THE COMMISSION VERY MUCH SUPPORTS S. B. FOUR SIX FIVE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

SO WILL- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO AHEAD ON SB THREE EIGHTY SENATOR EGGMAN OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CARE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. OKAY THE FOR MY THIRD AND FINAL BILL TODAY MEMBERS ANOTHER BILL THAT YOU- YOU'VE YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE ON THIS FLOOR- WE PASSED- END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WENT INTO EFFECT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SINCE THE INITIAL BILL PASSED WE'VE HAD I'VE HAD HILL TWO OVERSIGHT HEARINGS IN THE ASSEMBLY SOME OF YOU PARTICIPATING IN THAT- WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT THAT WAS WHEN THE COMMITMENTS I MADE WHEN WE PASSED THE BILL WAS TO SAY WE WOULD CONTINUE TO HOLD HEARINGS AND HEAR FROM PHYSICIANS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND- AND EVERYBODY ABOUT HOW THE BILL WAS ACTUALLY GING SO WE CAN MAKE SURE. THAT NONE OF THE FEARS THAT WERE EXPRESSED EARLY ON- CAME TO FRUITION- THROUGH THOSE THE MOST THING THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IS NOT THE ANY ANY KIND OF ABUSE THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY REPORTED ABUSE OF THE ACT AT ALL BUT BARRIERS TO THE ACT- FOR PATIENT ACCESS. TO AFTER- FIVE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION THE CURRENT PROCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES FOR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE END STAGES OF LIFE AND UNNECESSARILY CUMBERSOME AND WITH MANY ROADBLOCKS STILL IN THE PLACE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT ONE STUDY FROM KAISER PERMANENTE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT ONE THIRD OF TERMINALLY ILL ADULT TO REQUEST AT THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. DIED BEFORE THE BE ABLE IN COMPLETING THE TIME CONSUMING PROCESS THAT IT TAKES TO BE ABLE TO USE THE OPTION- JUST YOU SO WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE ARE ASKING TO DO IS TO REMOVE THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD AS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY NEEDS TO ASK THEIR PHYSICIAN THEIR ATTENDING PHYSICIAN DO IT TO START IT AND THEN DO THAT IN WRITING THREE DAYS LATER AND THEN FIFTEEN DAYS LATER JUST DO IT YET AGAIN. THERE'S ACTUALLY FOUR POINTS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION THAT FIFTEEN DAY CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED FOR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IF THE FIRST POSITION THEY ASK- DOES NOT PARTICIPATE TAKES A WHILE TO FIND ANOTHER ONE AND THEN ANOTHER FOR THAT. FIFTEEN DAYS LATER- I GUESS AS YOU AS A STUDY AND THE WE'VE- OFTEN PEOPLE DIED. IN A EXACTLY THE WAY THAT THEY FEAR DYING BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE. TO USE THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED FOR THEM NOT TO BE ABLE TO DIE IN WAYS THAT. THEY DON'T CARE FOR JUST RECENTLY SO WE'RE ASKING- TO BROOD REDUCE THAT DOWN TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS VERSUS FIFTEEN DAYS- JUST RECENTLY NEW MEXICO. PASSED AND OF LIFE LEGISLATION THAT INCLUDES A FORTY EIGHT HOUR WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN THE ORAL REQUEST FOR AID IN DYING MEDICATION. WE THINK THAT WILL NOT GO FAR FOR AND PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO AND GET PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE UP TO FIFTEEN DAYS BUT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO USE IT IN IN TWO DAYS. IF NEEDED TO DO THAT SECOND REQUEST. IT IS ALSO BECOME VERY CLEAR THAT THAT SECOND WRITTEN REQUEST DESCRIBED AS THE FINAL ATTESTATION. IS UNNECESSARY IT IS GIVEN TO THE PATIENT BY THEIR ATTENDING PHYSICIAN AND THEY MUST. YET ONCE AGAIN WHEN THEY'RE ALONE SIGN TO SAY YES I AM YES I'M STILL SURE- AND THAT AGAIN WE DON'T THINK THAT FOURTH TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO IT IS REDUNDANT. FAMILIES FIND IT OFFENSIVE- IF YOU WILL- AND SO WE'RE SAYING THAT THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO THERE ARE ENOUGH STEPS IN PLACE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION. BOTH ORALLY AND IN WRITING THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AT THE VERY END- CURRENTLY THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT REQUIRES THE ATTENDING PHYSICIANS TO REMIND QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. DO NOT ADMINISTER THE SELF ADMINISTER IT IN PUBLIC PLACE- WHICH WE MEANT TO MEET MORE AT A PARK THEY MAY USE IT AT A HOSPITAL AND SO THIS JUST GO VERIFIES THAT FOR PEOPLE- ANOTHER INC INCONSISTENCY. IS THE IN WHICH OR REQUEST FOR AID IN DYING R. D. DATED AND DOCUMENTED ON A PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORD SO OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. WHEN THEY BEGAN SO WE'RE SAYING- THAT PEOPLE MUST AT THIS BILL MAINTAINS THE COR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT ONLY TERMINALLY ILL. ADULTS ARE ABLE TO DO THIS ALL OF THOSE THAT THINGS WILL REMAIN THE SAME- ALL PATIENTS WILL STILL HAVE TO MAKE TWO OR REQUEST A WRITTEN REQUEST AND BE EVALUATED BY TWO SEPARATE POSITIONS. AT TO BE ABLE TO CERTIFY THAT THIS IS A PERSON WHO IS TERMINALLY ILL FROM WHICH NO CURE IS EXPECTED WITH SIX MONTHS OR LESS TO BE ABLE. TO LIVE- SO WE THINK THESE ARE REASONABLE THAT REQUEST AND THEN FINALLY WE ARE ASKING TO REMOVE THE SUNSET ON THIS- THIS BILL HAS BEEN EFFECT SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND WE HAVE OVER TWENTY YEARS OF DOCUMENTATION AND DATA FROM OREGON- AND WELL OF MORE THAN THAT WORLDWIDE OF THE LACK OF ABUSE IN THIS- WE KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO. TEND TO USE THIS THERE WAS A- FEAR ABOUT IT'S GOING TO BE POOR PEOPLE OR- ARE DISABILITIES PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- OVERWHELMINGLY. THE BILL HAS BEEN USED BY. THE MAJORITY OF A CAUCASIAN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS EDUCATED PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN- AGENCY OVER THEIR LIFE THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND AT THE VERY END. OFTENTIMES AND MAKE THIS DECISION. SO THERE'S BEEN NO DOCUMENTATION OF COERCION OR ABUSE AT ALL. WE KNOW ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY USED IT I WE ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE OFTENTIMES WHEN THEY GET THE PRESCRIPTIONS THEY DON'T EVEN USE IT BUT IT'S KNOWING THAT IS THERE. THAT GIVES THEM THE PEACE TO BE ABLE TO DIE ON THEIR OWN TERMS- WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AND HAVE TAKEN. AMENDMENTS THAT ALLOW BOTH OF THEM TO BE OKAY WITH THIS BILL AND BE NEUTRAL. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORTERS DR KATHERINE FORREST W. C. S. F. AND KIMBERLY CATTLEMAN WHO IS THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF COMPASSION AND CHOICES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WILL OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHENEVER THEY'RE READY HI MY NAME IS DR. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES MA'AM PLEASE GO AHEAD. IT HI MY NAME IS DR CATHERINE ZAHN PUTS FORTH IN A CLINICAL ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIALISTS. CALIFORNIA END OF LIFE OPTIONS EXPECT FIVE YEARS AGO THIS MONTH I PRESCRIBE MEDICAL AID IN DYING FOR NUMEROUS TERMINALLY ILL CALIFORNIANS IN TRAINING HUNDREDS OF POSITIONS ON BEST PRACTICES FOR IT. ABOUT THE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MANY TIMES SUPPORT MEDICAL AID IN DYING. RIGHT NOW I'M HERE IN THE SOUTH OF THE MANY DYING IN HOSPICE CARE- TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE EIGHTY. IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. WELL FOR. MY BELOVED OF THIRTY SEVEN YEARS WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALS. ALSO KNOWN AS LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE HE WAS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL NAY. RETURNING NAY ON THE WAY A LITTLE AFTER THE WITH THE DIVISION AND TOLD ME. CHAPLAIN IF YOU'VE NOT COOPER THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE MEDICAL AID IN DYING HASTEN MY INEVITABLE DEATH FROM THE SUFFERING. I WOULD BE TERRIFIED RIGHT. NOW I'D BE ABSOLUTELY. I THANK YOU. AB ALTHOUGH THE BILLION PUBLIC SCIENTISTS MINE WHICH OCCURRED CALIFORNIA COVERAGE TIRELESSLY FOR THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD REMAIN ON TOP. THE BODY MUST LOOK AT YOUR YOU RAPIDLY UNTIL WE CANNOT FUNCTION AT ALL ULTIMATELY HE WILL LOSE THE ABILITY TO GRIEVE. R. EIGHT. WELL BACK. ON IMAGINABLE SUFFERING. AND HE WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE MEDICAL AID IN DYING BEFORE THAT LITTLE BUBBLE LEVEL ACCEPTING A KERR. BUT THE ACTUAL STEPS FOR ACCESSING THE OPTION WERE NOT EASY EVEN FOR UP. THE NUMBER ONE BARRIER OUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN OFFICES ARE NOW OWNED BY A CATHOLIC SYSTEM WOULD CREATE WITH THE DOCTORS FROM PARTICIPATING IN MEDICAL AID IN DYING THEREFORE HIS PCP COULD NOT BE A PRESCRIBER. NUMBER TWO BARRIER IT'S HARD TO FIND OUT WHICH PARTICIPANTS PARTICIPATE MEDICAL AID IN DYING. LUCKILY WILL WAS ALREADY A PATIENT AT STANFORD FOR ANOTHER SPECIAL CARE AND PAPER PARTICIPATES IN MEDICAL AID IN DYING. IN FACT I HELP SET UP THAT SYSTEM WHEN I WAS ON FACULTY THERE CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH OR DON'T KNOW HOW HOW IT WORKS TO ACCESS. MEDICAL AID IN DYING. IN THE NUMBER THREE BERRIER DELAYS IN CARE THE LAW REQUIRES PEOPLE OF APPOINTMENTS FOR BUSINESS TO CONFIRM DIAGNOSIS. AND PROGNOSIS AT LEAST FIFTEEN DAYS APART HOWEVER. FOR WELL IT TOOK OVER A MONTH AND SHE SUFFERED AN ANXIETY ABOUT WHAT HE'S ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICAL AID IN DYING THANKFULLY WE NEED TO START THE PROCESS EARLY. BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T. MY UP TO DATE. YEAH SB THREE EIGHTY AND MAKE THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACKERMAN. AND REMOVE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS. THANK YOU FOR FIFTEEN DAYS HERE TO READ IT. BECAUSE TRANSPARENCY. AND EVERYTHING TO CONTINUE WHAT BY NOT ONLY FOR THE DEATH PAY PEOPLE BUT HER FAMILY MAX OFTEN MY TRUE LOVE IN LIFE WELL. THANK YOU. I YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ON TO OUR NAY WITH IN SUPPORT. HI CALLANAN AND I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE COMPASSIONATE CHOICES ACTION NETWORK- AND- I'M REPRESENTING MANY TERMINATE WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS JUST LIKE THE STORE YOU JUST HEARD FROM DR FARRIS I'D LIKE TO THINK SENATOR EXPENDITURE WOULD FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THE pBILL AND- EXPRESS MY THANKS TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR CONSIDERING MAKING THE CALIFORNIA END OF LIFE OPTION ACT PERMITTED CAN IMPROVE THE NEXT BATTLE. I DO KNOW IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- AND MANY OF YOU- CRAFTED THIS LAW AND IT HAS RESULTED IN MUCH GREATER HUMANITY AT LIFESPAN SINCE THE LAW TOOK EFFECT NEARLY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE REALIZE PEACE OF MIND AFTER GETTING. A PRESCRIPTION FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING. A LOT HAS ALSO INDIRECTLY BENEFIT MANY OTHER TO. ILL READ THE BY IMPROVING ACCESS HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE AS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE LA TIMES. THE REVISIONS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SB THREE EIGHTY REALLY VERY MODEST THEY ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ACHIEVE THE ORIGINAL INTENTION OF THE BILL- BE STRANGER CAME ABOUT AS THE RESULT OF INPUT FROM HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FROM HOSTAGES FROM PHYSICIANS AT A HALF A CENTURY COMBINED DATA AND EXPERIENCE FROM CALIFORNIA AND EIGHT OTHER AUTHORIZED JURISDICTION. WE THEY CAME FOR THE DIRECT YOU BACK TO PATIENTS THAT WERE TRYING ACCESS THE LAW WE ALSO WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION TO GET THEIR INPUT ON THE BILL. AND AS A RESULT BOTH HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION. SB THREE EIGHTY REMOVE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO MEDICAL AID IN DYING BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I FELT THAT IT MAINTAINS. ALL THE IMPORTANT PATIENT SAFEGUARDS OUR GOAL IS SIMPLY TO ALLOW MORE DYING CALIFORNIA TO CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE OPTION. WHILE STILL ENSURING THAT EIGHTY ABOUT OLD BUILDING BUT POPULATIONS ARE PROTECTED. A PATIENT MUST STILL BE TERMINALLY ILL MENTALLY CAPABLE DATE MARK TO VOLUNTARILY REQUESTED MEDIC. MEDICATION MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE WRITING AND- VERBALLY AND THEY MUST BE ABLE TO SELL THE GAS THE MEDICATION- I COMPLETE. THE THIRTEENTH STEP PROCESS. IT IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT IF. ARE NOT FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING BECAUSE OF EACH- DISABILITY THEY MUST BE IMMINENTLY DYING. AND WE KNOW FOR SURVEYS ACROSS THE STATE THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES SUPPORT MEDICAL AID IN DYING LEGISLATION. TWO DIFFERENT POSITIONS MUST BE EVALUATE THE PATIENT ASK OUR MAY NEED DISTRICT CRITERIA. ADDITIONALLY JUSTICE AND ALL THE OTHER OFF THE COAST OF THE OTHER ALL RIGHT STATE THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PLUS COLLECT AND PUBLISH IT TO MONTANA TO MONITOR THE LAW WHICH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. HAS BEEN DOING SINCE THE BEGINNING. AS SENATOR EGGMAN MENTIONED- THERE THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES SERVICES REDUCING THE FISCAL DAY WAITING PERIOD DOWN TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS AS YOU HEARD FROM DR FARRIS IT TAKES PEOPLE. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS EVEN WITHOUT A WAITING PERIOD. BEING PUT INTO THE LAW. I IT WORKED OUT FOR A MAN THEIR TO YEARS AGO ALLOW. ON FOR. TO WAIT THE WAY PERIOD AND IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THAT LAW BEING PUT TO WORK BACK SEVENTY FIVE PATIENTS EXCEPTION. IT DEMONSTRATES JUST HOW MUCH OF A BURDEN THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD IS ON A DYING PERSON. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BOTH LINES ARE OPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN YOU HEAR ME YES MA'AM PLEASE GO AHEAD.

NODDING EXPEDITED PROCESS. WITH LITTLE TO NO SAFEGUARDS THAT CAN LEAD. TO THE ULTIMATE IN EVERITT FOCAL BOLD DECISION TO TERMINATE THE LIGHT. I URGE YOU TO THAT CHRONIC USE OF SOME DRUGS. CAN LEAD TO BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM CHANGES IN THE BRAIN WHICH CAN LEAD TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING DEPRESSION. EXTRADITING THE TIME FRAMES. THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR PROPER REPEAT PROPER ASSESSMENT BACKING ADDRESS POSSIBLE PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASSES OF THE VERY FEW PRACTICE STATUS THAT MAY BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO A DECISION TO TERMINATE LIFE IS DEEPLY ALARMING TO ME AT PALATINA.

ARE ACTING IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY CARE FOR. I NEED FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THE CRIPPLING POVERTY AND SELF SACRIFICING NATURE OF SO MANY ELDERS IN MY LATINO COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS A LACK OF SAFETY NET SERVER SAYS MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND DOOR. I WONDER IF I CAN TELL YOU THIS EXPEDITED PATHWAYS SIDE IT'S A DEVASTATING INDUCEMENTS THAT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT OUR LATINO OUTDOORS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR ALLOWING US TO SHARE TESTIMONIALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE WHITE HIM ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY RIGHT CALIFORNIA AND WE ALSO REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO SP THREE EIGHTY I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY RIGHTS EDUCATION AND DEFENSE FUND- OUR BOARD D. R. C. COMPRISES THE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND FAMILY MEMBERS. OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ADOPTED PRINCIPLE ON PHYSICIAN ASSISTED SUICIDE WHICH SPECIFIED THE PROTECTION WHICH SHOULD BE IN PLACE. GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLES WE DO BELIEVE THAT SB THREE EIGHTY LACK SUFFICIENT CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE. THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN ORAL REQUEST. SERVES AS A VITAL PATIENT FACE CARD. A LANCET STUDY FOUND THAT A PATIENT WILL TO LIVE COMPLEXION WEIGHT 30% IN A TWELVE HOUR PERIOD IN BETWEEN 6270% OVER THIRTY DAYS. MANY PEOPLE REQUESTING ASSISTED SUICIDE HAVE CHANGED THEIR MIND SOME LIVING DECADES BEYOND THEIR PROGNOSIS HAVING ACHIEVED A CURE FOR THEIR SUPPOSEDLY. TERMINAL ILLNESS. REDUCING THE WAITING PERIOD TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS PUT THE LIFE OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AT RISK. FURTHER REMOVING THE APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS PUT THE PATIENT AT KANEMI AT RISK OPENING THE DOOR TO ABUSE BY GREEDY HIRES OR ABUSIVE CAREGIVERS. NO RECORDING NO THIRD PARTY WITNESSES AT THE TIME OF DEATH MAKE IT SO NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW IF THE PERSON CHANGE THEIR MIND OR IF THERE WAS COERCION SHE REMARKED ADVOCACY WOK WE KNOW THAT IN MEDICAL STUDIES THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT ALWAYS VALUED AS HIGHLY AS BOTH PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES. WHICH HAS LED TO THE FAILURE TO OFFER FOR THE DENIAL OF MEDICAL TREATMENT SUPPORT AND SERVICES SH. THE WEBSITE IS NOT ABOUT CHOICE WHEN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LACK ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT MEDICAL CARE THE COCA NINETEEN PANDEMIC RELIEVE LONGSTANDING DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WE WITNESSED DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF INFECTION AND MORTALITY IN OUR AGING AND DISABILITY COMMUNITY AS WELL AS ARE BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING INEQUITIES. IN OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. FINALLY IN CALIFORNIA. PATIENTS REASONS FOR RESTORE TO ASSISTED. OR NOT. TO THE PUBLIC IN FACT THERE ARE. CRUCIAL DATA POINTS THAT ARE LIFTING AND MOST TO GREG GREG GREG YES CALIFORNIA HAS ADMITTED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE UNDERLYING DATA EVERY THREE YEARS. AT A RECENT OVERSIGHT HEARING. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SHARED THAT DATA COLLECTION THE STATE DOES TWO SHOWS LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW BUT THE STATE HAS NO ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMECREATOR. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER VICE CHAIR. YEAH I JUST- THINKING BACK ON- THE MY FIRST TERM IN IN OFFICE- REMEMBERING- THIS BILL WHEN IT CAME BEFORE US AND- I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOU WHEN YOU WERE- IN THIS THIS HOUSE- AND- AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THOSE OF US ON ONE HAND THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT BILL THAT AT THE TIME IT ACTUALLY SAYS ACTUALLY MOST DIFFICULT BILL WHATEVER VOTED ON- AND I ALSO THINK THAT THIS BODY- ROSE. TO THE OCCASION CHAU DEMOCRACY AT ITS FINEST I STILL REMEMBER- THAT DAY WAS JUST- TALKING TO ANOTHER MEMBER ABOUT THE THAT DAY THE BEST SPEECH ON THE FLOOR- IN SUPPORT- I THOUGHT CAME FROM REPUBLICAN THAT DAY AND- I THOUGHT THE BEST SPEECH OPPOSED CAME FROM OF THE DEMOCRATIC THAT DAY- AND- IT WAS- TWO AND A HALF HOURS IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY OF FLOOR DEBATE- AND IT WAS DIFFICULT. I VOTED NO- THEN- AND I WAS WAVERING ALL OVER THE PLACE ON- ON ON THE BILL- I WENT FROM BEING I SUPPORT OF THE BILL TO END UP- ULTIMATELY. VOTING VOTING NO ON THE BILL AND I WONDER IF THAT BILLS BEFORE US TODAY- WHAT I SUPPORT AND I THINK I PROBABLY I PROBABLY WOULD AND- ALTHOUGH I VOTED NO AT THE AT THE TIME- I THINK THE QUESTION AND- AND MAYBE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS AND-- IT'S- THAT QUESTION A FIFTEEN. TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND REALLY THE QUESTION OF. OF SAFEGUARD- AND- AND THEN THAT ISSUE ATTESTATION- I SEE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT AN ATTESTATION THERE'S STILL SORT OF A WRITTEN. A WRITTEN SO CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT ABOUT THAT- I'D LIKE TO THAT THAT TO ME SORT OF THE HANG UP IS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE STILL PROPER SAFEGUARDS. YES THE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I DON'T THINK A ANYBODY WHO WAS HERE IN THAT ROOM THAT THEY WILL WILL EVER FORGET THOSE A LOT OF EMOTIONS- I'M BERNARD HAD BECAUSE IT'S AN ISSUE OF LIFE AND DEATH RATE THAT I DON'T THINK WE EVER DEBATE THINGS MORE- THAT ARE MORE REAL TO US- THEN. SOMETHING THAT WE ALL EXPERIENCE RIGHT WE ALL EXPERIENCE BIRTH WE ALL EXPERIENCED DEATH- AND WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT IT BECOMES VERY EMOTIONAL FOR PEOPLE. OF WE PUT A LOT OF SAFE GUARDS INTO THE BILL IN ORDER TO. MAKE MAKE SURE THAT. THE THAT THE THERE WOULD BE NO ABUSE THAT'S A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT IF YOU RECALL PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT. COERCION POVERTY DISABILITY ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WERE. WERE SB HAVE SAID IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS WHEN THEY DO THIS YEAH- SO THAT'S WHAT THE FIFTEEN DAY WHAT KIND OF SET OUT TO DO BUT WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT IT HAS BECOME A BARRIER FOR PEOPLE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WAS EVER THE INTENTION OF THE FIFTEEN DAYS WAS A SAFEGUARD. BUT NOT THAT IT SERVES AS A BARRIER- THE DATA SHOWS US- AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH COLLECTS THE DATA HAS SHOWN US. THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE. PART OF ME HERE- ARE THOSE THAT ARE- IN HOSPICE CARE SO OVER 85% ARE IN HOSPICE CARE SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHO WAKES UP PEOPLE LIKE TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION AS YOU WAKE UP ONE DAY AND SAY. I'M HAVING A BAD DAY I THINK I'M JUST GONNA GO GET THE PRESCRIPTION PEOPLE HAVE LIVED YEARS OFTENTIMES IN IN IT ACTIVE TREATMENT TRYING TO FIND A WAY RIGHT THERE'S NOBODY I WOULD GET I WOULD OFFER YOU WHO HAVE HAS USED THIS. THAT WANTS TO DIE. RIGHT BUT WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE. AND THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE WHO HAVE A TERMINAL ILLNESS FROM WHICH NO CURES EXPECTED. WHO WISH TO USE THIS. SO THAT FIFTEEN DAY THAT ACTED WE YOU KNOW WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS. THAT THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE DID NOT EXIST THE DATA HAS SHOWN US THAT THAT DOESN'T- IT IT TENDS TO BE I GET A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THEY TEND TO BE. EDUCATED HAVE INSURANCE BE IN HOSPICE. INTENDED BECAUSE CAJUN- IS WHAT WHAT THE DATA HAS SHOWN US BUT AGAIN THAT. TO SHORTEN IT TO TWO DAYS AND AGAIN THIS WAS NEGOTIATED WITH. WITH PHYSICIANS SO IT WENT DR PAN- AND IT'S AND THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN- IN NEW MEXICO. AND IT DOES IT DOES SHORT AS SIGNIFICANTLY BUT AGAIN IT DOSN'T HAVE TO BE. TWO DAYS RIGHT IT CAN BE FIFTEEN DAYS IT CAN BE LONGER THAN THAT. IF PEOPLE WANT- BUT THE BUT BUT THAT HAS JUST SERVED AS A BEAR YOU HEARD- DR FORREST. WHOSE HUSBAND HAS. A LS RIGHT SO L. AS WE KNOW. WHEN IT IS SEVERE LIKE. IT ALMOST ALWAYS IS. BUT WILL OFTENTIMES AND PREVENT YOU FROM BREATHING PROVENCHER FROM SWALLOWING PREVENT YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO USE YOUR HANDS. SO IF SOMEBODY ACTUALLY AND THAT IS THE LAW SAYS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT. AND IT JUST IT YOURSELF. CAN YOU IMAGINE. SO DAYS OUT TO DAYS OUT AND YOU NO LONGER USE YOUR HANDS. AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE AND THAT IS COMING THE ACTUAL AND THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT. SO AFTER THAT NEGOTIATION IS HOW WE SAID WELL LET'S LET'S. FORTY EIGHT HOURS. SO THAT THAT IS WORKING FROM SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW MAY STILL NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. BUT THAT IS WHAT THE MEDICAL SOCIETY AND WHAT PATIENTS- AND AGAIN WE HEARD THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT SOMEBODY WENT TO THEIR POSITION. THEN THE POSITION SAID OH I'M SORRY. I KNOW YOU WANT TO USE IT BUT- BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO IT FOR YOU AND THEN THEY HAVE TO TRY TO GO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE FIFTEEN DAYS LATER. AGAIN THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS OFTENTIMES THEY- HAVE THOUGHT WELL I'LL DO IT LATER. AND BY THEN IT BECOMES TOO LATE AND PEOPLE DIE IN WAYS THAT THEY DON'T WANT. THAT LAST ESTá STATION AGAIN THEY HAVE TO- THAT. GO TO THE PHYSICIAN. AND THEN PUT IT IN WRITING. AND THEN GO TO ANOTHER ONE AND IF ANYONE FEELS THAT PERSON IS DEPRESSED OR HAS ANY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THEN THEY ARE REFERRED TO A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER WHO THEN HAS TO SIGN OFF. THEN THEY HAVE TO GO GET THE PRESCRIPTION. AND SIGNED SO ARE THERE ARE STILL MULTIPLE STEPS ALONG THE WAY AND THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES. AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAVE SAID TOO THAT THE THIS THE STEPS. TO SAFEGUARD TO BECOME BARRIERS AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND PEOPLE CAN'T ACCESS THE LAW THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE. TO GIVE PEOPLE PEACE OF MIND. THAT YOUR QUESTION IT DOES I JUST WANTED TO SAY FACT I'VE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED WORKING WITH YOU OVER THE YEARS BACK WHEN YOU WERE OUT. HERE IN THIS HOUSE AND- ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS- REALLY RESPECTED THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY AND EFFORT THAT YOU PUT IN- TO NOT JUST- THIS ISSUE BUT OTHER ISSUES AS WELL YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK- YOU'VE TAKEN. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF. OF FIRE- FROM FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT YOU'VE YOU'VE WORKED THROUGH ALL OF THEM- AND JUST THE FACT THAT YOU ARE RUNNING THIS AT TODAY GIVES ME. A SENSE OF- OF PEACE- IF YOU WILL- AND SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANTED TO ALSO COMMIT ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' SENTIMENT- FROM PALM SPRINGS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS PUTTING YOUR HEART AND SOUL INTO EACH OF THE ISSUE AREAS THAT YOU WORK AND THANK YOU FOR ALSO. PUTTING IN YOUR THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT PRIOR TO BEING AN ELECTED OFFICIAL YOU HAD EXPERIENCE WORKING IN AND SO YOU'RE BRINGING YOUR EXPERIENCE TO THE FOREFRONT- I HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS TODAY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH OF ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT WERE OPPOSING AND- EIGHT TO MADE ME REALIZE THAT I NEEDED TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE RESEARCH AND MY- AND I CAME ACROSS. A REPORT- WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE- FROM CDPH FROM JULY TWENTY TWENTY. THAT LISTS AND ENUMERATES ALL THE DIFFERENT DATA. FOR THE SERIES OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING AGE GENDER LEVEL OF EDUCATION. ETHNICITY RACE- UNDERLYING ILLNESSES. AS WELL AS INSURANCE HOSPICE CARE. A LOT OF DATA POINTS THAT I THOUGHT WERE CRITICAL. AND MAKES THIS DECISION A LOT EASIER WHEN YOU LOOK AT. A THIS ISSUE. ABSENT THIS DATA IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO- THE I WAS STILL GOING TO BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE ISSUE AS I WAS. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT I JUST WONDERED. WHY NOT COLLECT SOME MORE DATA- BUT AFTER I SAW THIS EIGHT AM. I JUST WANTED TO AS AN INDIVIDUAL BRING THIS UP THAT IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE OPPOSITION. TO BE LOOKING AT THIS DATA. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW EXACTLY- WHEN WE ARE USING FEAR TACTICS AND WHEN WE ARE- ACTUALLY LOOKING AT. IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND NOT JUST CREATING MYTHS- THIS WAS VERY EYE OPENING TO SEE THAT HAS HAD A EITHER DOCTORAL MASTER'S OR BACHELOR'S DEGREE- AND OVER 53% WERE EITHER IN THERE BETWEEN THERE SEVENTIES AND NINETIES- SO A LOT OF THE CONCERNS. THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP DON'T SEEM TO MATCH UP WITH THE DATA THAT'S PRESENTED- BUT I ALSO. GIVEN HOW SENSITIVE THIS ISSUE IS I THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO ALWAYS HAVE A VERY CAREFUL AND OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT. SO THAT THE INITIAL NUMBERS WHICH SEEM TO PROVE ARE YOUR POINT- WE MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALWAYS DOING IT WITH A CAUTIOUS LANDS AND MAKE SURE THAT IT NEVER STRAYS FROM WHO IT IS THAT REALLY WANTS THIS TO HAPPEN AND GETS THE ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED SO WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISS BURKE- SO WE MAKE A LOT OF DECISIONS ON THIS FLOOR IN OUR COMMITTEES AND- AS A FRESHMAN I WAS A CO AUTHOR WITH YOU ON THIS BILL AND I HAVE NEVER ONCE REGRETTED IT THERE ARE HARD CHOICES FOR FAMILIES AND NO ONE TAKES THEM LIGHTLY- YOU HAVE BEEN AS OUR PLACES SAID A TRUSTWORTHY AUTHOR AND THE DATA. PROVES THAT YOUR WORK IS SHOWING TO BE REAL AND- REALLY BEING ON THE FOREFRONT OF WHAT IS HONEST AND TRUE. AND SO I WOULD I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT I GET TO JOIN YOU AGAIN AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS MEASURE IT IS- LIFE CHANGING FOR FAMILIES WHO. HAVE TO GO THROUGH THESE. TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS IT IS- EMOTIONALLY TRYING. AND TO JUST KNOW THAT THE SUPPORT IS THERE FOR YOUR LOVED ONES. TO TRANSITION IN THE WAY THAT THEY CHOOSE- AND IN A SAFE MANNER THAT YOU HAVE LAID OUT VERY VERY WELL AS YOU SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS IT'S AND- IT JUST CHANGE MAKES IT AN OPTION- FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD FAMILY THAT HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT OPTION IS STILL FIVE. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN THIS IS WAS A HARD. TRIED TO THE FIRST TO ANSWER- HOWEVER HE REALLY GOT BROKEN UP. IT WAS HARD THEN I KNOW IT CONTINUES TO BE DIFFICULT NO ONE WANTS TO MAKE THESE CHOICES BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THE FOREFRONT OF THIS WORK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY MEANINGFUL.

THAT IT WAS OPERATING AS WE INTENDED AND THAT'S WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO THIS VERY IN DETAIL FOR YOU IT IS IT IS S. AS MUCH AS WE THOUGHT- IN LIFE BUT IT IS INTERESTING WE LIVE AS WE DIVE RIGHT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF EDUCATION INTENDED BECAUSE CAJUN HAVE AT AGENCY ALL THEIR LIFE AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS AND OFTEN WANT TO DO THAT AT THE END. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE REST OF US WHO ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT SOME DAY AS A WEEK AS WE CONTINUE TO GAIN AGENCY IN THE WORLD- AND CONTINUE TO REDUCE EQUITIES THIS THIS WILL THEN BE AVAILABLE PERHAPS TOWARD MORE BUT IT IS ALWAYS JUST. AN OPTION AND I KNOW AGAIN ANY TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OPTIONS AROUND LIFE AND DEATH- THEY ARE DIFFICULT MEMBERS BUT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE- WHO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER KAREN MEMBERS ON THIS BILL IS ABOUT BIRTH SB SIXTY FIVE RECOGNIZES THAT UNFORTUNATELY EVEN WITH OUR ADVANCED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OUR WEALTH AND OUR EDUCATION THAT INFANT MORTALITY AND MATERNAL REPORT MORTALITY. ARE HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA IN THE US THAN ALL OTHER. COUNTRIES IN OTHER WORDS COUNTRIES THAT HAVE COMPARABLE FIVE ECONOMIC- ADVANCEMENT AS WE HEAD OUT. SO DEATHS ARE FOR AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL TO ADDRESS THAT- IT BUILDS ON LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT SENATOR MITCHELL THERE WAS PASSED THAT ESTABLISHED IN IMPLICIT BIAS PROGRAM FOR PERINATAL CARE PROVIDERS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THESE HIGH RATES. OF INFANT MORTALITY MATERNAL MORTALITY FALLS MUCH MORE A MONTH BLACK PARENTS AND THEN BROWN PARENTS AND IN OUR NATIVE AMERICAN OR INDIGENOUS PARENTS. SO WHAT SB SIXTY FIVE DOES. IS IT CREATES A PREGNANCY ASSOCIATION MORTALITY REVIEW BOARD. AND IT REQUIRES SOME DATA COLLECTION SO THAT THAT REVIEW BOARD CAN LOOK AT THAT COLLECT THAT DATA AND TRY TO GET US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S CAUSING THESE THINGS SO WE CAN ADDRESS IT IS THE FUTURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IT ALLOWS WORKING PEOPLE TO STAY ON MEDICARE ALL OF YEAR AFTER BIRTH AND IT EXTENDS CAL WORKS TO LOW INCOME PREGNANT PEOPLE WITH SOME HIGHER MONTHLY STIPENDS AND MAKES WORK OPTIONAL AND AS WE KNOW OFTEN THINGS THAT COMPLICATE BIRDS ARE LIKE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE PREGNANCY DIABETES OTHER ISSUES THOSE ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH IF YOU'RE ALSO BEING REQUIRED TO WORK TO AND KEEP YOUR MEDICAL BENEFITS.

HOWEVER FOR GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON DISPARITIES THAT BLACK AND INDIGENOUS BREAKING PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR FAITH IT'S NOT JUST PROVIDER TRAINING THAT IS NEEDED SB SIXTY FIVE TO CALIFORNIA MOM THE BEST BILLS INSPIRED BY FEDERAL MOM THE BEST EFFORT CAME FROM THE COSPONSORED MANY SUPPORTERS AN AUTHOR PUTTING OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND THINKING. IF WE REALLY WANT TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON MATERNAL HEALTH DISPARITIES WE'RE STILL FACING IN THE STATE WHAT WOULD IT TAKE WHY IS IT THAT DESPITE HAVING SOME OF THE LOWEST MUCH THAT MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY RATES IN THE COUNTRY WE'RE STILL FAILING WHEN WE BREAK. THOSE STATISTICS DOWN BY RIGHT. NOW WE'RE HAVING A NOW CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PURVEY. OF RACISM AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

SB SIXTY FIVE ADDRESSES THESE QUESTIONS TO THE- FOLLOWING. WEEK CODIFYING DISPATCHING A MATERNAL MORTALITY REVIEW COMMITTEE MUCH LIKE THE CURRENT ONE. THAT WE CAN FOCUS REQUIRE A FOCUS ON RACIAL DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY AND BRING ORE PEOPLE TO THE TABLE TO EXAMINE THESE ISSUES TO AVOID FUTURE MISTAKES.

AND US CERTAINLY- WE WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT BUT WE ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT ALL BIRTHING PARENTS SO WITHOUT ASTEROID VOTE AND DEFINITELY WILL INCLUDE THE TO CALL OUT TO REQUEST THANK YOU THANK YOU A MAN SECRETARY. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WHAT I MAYES. MAYES I THANK YOUR CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY I GARCIA. BIGELOW BURKE BURKE I CARILLO CARILLO EYEING FLORIDA. MAIENSCHEIN MCCARTY NAZARIAN. RIVAS RODRIGUEZ. SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I WALDRON. SIX ZERO IF SIX VOTES WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL AND WILL- IT'S LIKE TO GO ON TO YOUR NEXT BILL SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR THANKS SO MUCH SHARE- I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT IF WE IF ANY OF US HAVE A PHARMACIST OR PHARMACY THAT WE'VE HAD A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WE HAVE USED TO GET OUR PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED AT THE PHARMACY IS WITHIN OUR HEALTH INSURANCE NETWORK THE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT. AND SO WHAT SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR DOES IS IT PROHIBITS PATIENT BENEFIT MANAGERS PATIENT BENEFIT MANAGERS OR ENTITIES THAT HEALTH INSURERS SOMETIMES CONTRACT WITH AND- THERE THE PURPOSE IS TO YOU KNOW HELP A I ENSURE THAT WE GET COSTS AND OBVIOUSLY OUR HEALTH INSURERS WANT TO DO THAT- BUT THOSE PATIENT BENEFIT MANAGERS HAVE GONE IN THE DIRECTION OF TRYING TO STEER PATIENTS TO PARTICULAR PHARMACIES AND BASICALLY TELLING THE PATIENT THAT YOU CAN USE NO PHARMACY EXCEPT. X. AND THE OTHER UNFORTUNATE FACT IS THAT MANY OF THESE PATIENT BENEFIT MANAGERS ARE ACTUALLY THE OWNERS OF PHARMACY ENTITIES LIKE CVS. NOW CERTAINLY IF YOU USE CVS. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO AND YOU WANT TO GREAT. BUT TO BE REQUIRED TO USE A PARTICULAR PHARMACY WHETHER IT'S A MAIL ORDER ONE OR WHAT. WHEN YOU HAVE A PHARMACY IN YOUR NETWORK THAT IS PREFERABLE TO YOU. THERE IS NO REASON THAT YOU SHOULD BE FORCED TO NOTE THIS BILL. ALLOWS STILL THE PATIENT BENEFIT MANAGER OR THE INSURER TO OFFER A DISCOUNT THROUGH THEIR PREFERRED PHARMACY THERE'S NO PROHIBITION ON THAT IT JUST PROHIBITS. REQUIRING YOU TO GO TO ONE PHARMACY ONE PHARMACY ONLY AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND THAT IS JIM GROSS FROM THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION AND CRAIG POST FOR FROM A P. LA HEALTH. FOR WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER SKINNER I WILL GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HI THIS IS A JIM GROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION. AND PERSON WANT TO THANK GOD SENATOR SKINNER FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE. I ALSO WANT TO- COMPLEMENT THE- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND VERY THOROUGH AND VERY WELL DONE AND WE APPRECIATE THAT- THE- PATIENT'S JERRY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT. EVERY DAY IT'S EXPECTED ACCESS MEDICATION ADHERENCE. IN THE FUTURE OF A ROBUST MARKET OF PHARMACY SERVICES WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT OUR DIVERSE. COMMUNITIES- THE PHARMACY BENEFIT NOW AND SO OF THEIR HELP PARTNER. ARE DENYING THE RIGHT USE THE PHARMACY OF THEIR CHOICE AND TO MAKE CLEAR EVEN THOUGH THOSE PHARMACIES HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THOSE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS AND HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT A CONSUMER CAN USE A PHARMACY THAT IS NOT IN THE PHARMACY IN THE PLAN'S NETWORK THESE ARE IN THE PLAN'S NETWORK EACH SIGN CONTRACTS. BE GOT CONSUMERS THE ENROLLEES HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AND THEN GENERALLY SPEAKING OUT OF THE BLUE AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT WE PROVIDED. A CONSUMERS TOLD THEY MUST GO TO A DIFFERENT PHARMACY WAR THERE'S A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE FOR SOME REASON THAT PHARMACY IS NOT ALLOWED TO DISPENSE THAT DRUGS AND IF YOU WANTED FROM THAT PHARMACY THAT YOU'VE BEEN GOING TO FOR YEARS YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. YEAH WE KNOW THE PBMS HAVE. SAID THAT THIS BILL IS DENYING CONSUMER CHOICE AND THAT'S JUST NOT ACCURATE IT'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE THAT PATIENCE. IS DENYING THE CHOICE BECAUSE IF IN FACT YOU ARE GIVEN NO CHOICE BUT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A RIGHT BY CONTRACT. TO GO TO THE PHARMACY BEEN GOING TO THE CHOICE IS BEING DENIED BY THE PBM OR THE HEALTH PLAN. AND I THINK THAT THAT. WE REALLY BELIEVE THEY WANT TO CONTROL THE PHARMACEUTICAL DOLLAR- D. OWNERSHIP BY ONE ENTITY ABOARD A PBM AND A PHARMACY AND AN INFUSION PHARMACY AND EVEN HEALTH PLAN TOGETHER. AND THAT DOES EXIST IN THE MARKET THAT KIND OF CONTROL REALLY MAKES IT SO THEY WANT TO STEER THE PATIENT TO MAIL ORDER OR BRICK AND MORTAR DETAIL. AND THAT TAKES AWAY COMPETITION AS WELL. NOW SENATOR SKINNER SAID. IF THESE PHARMACY BENEFIT. AND HEALTH PLANS ONE THOSE CA. THEY CAN ALL THEM FINDING IT'S SUCH A REDUCTION IN OR LIVE OF A CO PAY- TO GO TO THAT FOR. THAT THERE TO THE TWO AMERICANS. IF YOU DO THIS THIS ISN'T THE- IN SENATE DID YOU GET NOW WE HAVE THAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE BILL BUT IT HAS TO BE A DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE CONSUMER CAN'T BE AT THE REAL WE SAVE LOTS OF MONEY. BOB I THINK THAT THE OLDER. MARKET IS THAT. WE ARE BEING PUT IN A POSITION AS PHARMACISTS. TO NOT ONLY LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE CUSTOMERS THAT WE BELIEVE WE ARE TIRED OF THE BY CONTRACT. WILL PUT IN A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION OF SANE TO OUR OWN CUSTOMERS. I'M SORRY WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT ANYMORE YOU HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT YOU KNOW ORDER WHICH- CAN BE DEFINED FOR SOME- CONSUMERS BUT NOT FOR OTHERS OR TO BE A PHARMACY. THAT IS ACROSS TOWN FOR ONE THAT IS IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT FOLKS. ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THERE ARE VARIOUS REASONS WHY PEOPLE CHOOSE A PARTICULAR PHARMACY WE ARE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE WE'RE PROVIDING VALUE. AND THESE MONOPOLISTIC. PARA BUYERS. YEAH ARE YOU THESE- ARE NOT IN THE BEST AND OF THE KIDS. SO WE ASK YOU I DON'T. THANK YOU SO MUCH IN CENTER SKINNER I THINK WE HAVE A SECOND WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS THAT CORRECT YES THERE'S A SECOND WITNESS THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CRACKPOTS FROM BEHALF OF THE KLA HEALTH AND ACCURACY IN ONE OF THE LARGEST HIV SERVICE PROVIDERS AND L. A. COUNTY. TODAY OKAY MY COMMENT SPECIFICALLY ON HOW PATIENTS DURING THE IMPACT PEOPLE WITH HIV. AND OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS- MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS PRACTICE UNDERMINE THE REALLY CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATIENTS AND THEIR PHARMACISTS. MANY PATIENTS DEPEND ON THIS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP SOMEONE THEY'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS. TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS. AND TO HELP THEM REMAIN INSURANCE THEIR MEDICATION. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV AND OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS. PATIENTS DERIAN PREVENTS PATIENTS FROM FILLING THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS WITH A PHARMACIST THEY KNOW. AND YOU UNDERSTAND. THEIR UNIQUE MEDICAL HISTORY. CATIONS HEARING ALSO OCCUR UP PRIVATE ISSUE ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THOSE LIVING IN MORE RURAL AREAS. IF THE PATIENT CAN'T PICK UP THE MEDICATION AT THE PHARMACY OF CHOICE. AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE REQUIRED TO USE MAIL ORDER SOMEONE COULD FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL CONDITION WHICH COULD LEAD TO DISCRIMINATION FAMILY REJECTION AND EVEN VIOLENCE AND IT IS PRECISELY FOR THESE REASONS THE MANDATORY MAIL ORDER REQUIREMENTS. HAVE LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED TO BE AN APPROPRIATE EVENT I'M LAWFUL FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV. AND LASTLY I JUST WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF PATIENTS BEEN ABLE TO PICK-UP THEIR MEDICATION AT THE PHARMACY WHERE THEY FEEL SAFE WHERE THE PHARMACIST SPEAKS OUR LANGUAGE. AND WHERE THEY KNOW THEY'LL BE TREATED WITH RESPECT NOT HAVING A CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROVIDER IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS THE PEOPLE FALL OUT OF CARE. THE ENGINEERS OF COLOR AND PATIENT MUST BE GIVEN THE OPTION TO RECEIVE THEIR MEDICATION FROM A PHARMACY WHERE THEY WILL KNOW WHERE THEY KNOW THEY WILL RECEIVE CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT PRESS P. FIVE TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE- TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I THINK WE HAVE- MISTER BILL HAD. MISTER BAD CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS BILL HAD SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL CARE MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR. WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF PATIENT STEERING WHEN A HEALTH PLAN OR A PBM ON THE HEALTH AND BEHALF OF A HEALTH PLAN. COMMUNICATION TO BENEFICIARIES. WE ARE SIMPLY- COMMUNICATING THE PLAN BENEFIT DESIGN OUTLINED IN THE PLAN THAT THE PATIENT AND WALDRON SO THIS HAPPENED OUT OF THE BLUE. OR VIOLATION OF THE CONTRACT IN RALEIGH- OF THE BENEFICIARY AND WALDRON ON THE CONTRARY IS CONVEYING EXACTLY THE BENEFIT DESIGN THAT INDIVIDUAL CHOSE TO LIVE IN ROME. SB FIVE POINT FOUR WOULD LIVE THE- PM CAN OFFERED TO HELP PLAN SPONSORS SUCH AS POTENTIALLY EVEN OPT OUT MAY FOURTH. THIS IS IMPORTANT HEALTH PLANS USED TO DESTRUCTION THEIR HEALTH PLAN DOLLARS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BENEFICIARIES HAPPENED DOLLARS. THAT ABILITY IS NOT GOING TO DECREASED AFTER PASSING THE CONTRARY THE CENTER INCREASED TAX MATTERS FOR THE HEALTH PLAN. FOR THE BENEFICIARY AND LIMITING THOSE COMMUNICATIONS WERE FURTHER IMPEDE HEALTH PLANS ABILITY AND PM CENTER WE HAVE TO WORK WITH PATIENTS AND HEALTH PLANS. TO ATTEND PASSED- WE CERTAINLY BE WILLING TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS TO IMPROVE THE BILL BUT THIS TIME. THERE'S A COMMITTEE TO ANOTHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH I THINK THE OTHER PRIMARY WITNESS WAS- PRESTON YOUNG. UP IN THE GALLERY MISTER ROGER ALL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE TO FOUR. NOW THE OVERARCHING CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH SB FIVE TO FOUR AND THE REASON FOR OUR OPPOSITION IS THAT THE BILL WOULD ERODE THE INCENTIVE EMPLOYERS HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS HAVE. TO DESIGN A PARTICIPATING PHARMACY NETWORKS. IS NETWORKS INCLUDE MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES CHAIN PHARMACIES AND INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES. AND THEY HELP CONTROL PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS FOR PATIENTS IN ADDITION TO HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR DISRUPT THIS BENEFIT DESIGN AND THE CHOICES PLAN PARTICIPANTS MAKE TO REDUCE PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIAL. ACCORDING TO THE DAMAGE THE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ACCOUNTED FOR TWELVE POINT 7% OF TOTAL HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS. IF THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN THESE NETWORKS ARE REDUCED. THE COST CONTROLS OF THE WEEKEND AND UNFORTUNATELY WALL SB FIVE TO FOUR IS WELL INTENTIONED. IT WILL ACT AS A HEALTH CARE COST DRIVER. IN ADDITION ARE. COST CONCERNS WERE ALSO OPPOSED SB FIVE TO FOUR BECAUSE IT ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE. HOW SELF INSURED PLAN DESIGNS BENEFITS THIS IS GOVERNED BY A WRITTEN A RESIDENT FREE UP TO BUY FEDERAL SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED SB FIVE TO FOUR THANK YOU.

SB FIFTY SIX AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MEMBERS SB FIFTY SIX HEALTH FOR ALL SENIORS IS A BILL THAT WILL INCLUDE SENIORS AGES SIXTY AND UP IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF STATUS WHO MEET ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS. MEMBERS THESE ARE CALIFORNIANS THAT OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM TO MAKE LESS THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BUT ARE BARRED FROM THIS BASIC MEDICAL PROGRAM DUE TO THEIR DOCUMENTATION STATUS DESPITE THE TREMENDOUS ADVANCES TO REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S UNINSURED RATE. DOWN TO A HISTORIC LOW OF SIX POINT 8% THE UNINSURED RATES ARE STILL EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AMONGST UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS. WHO HAVE ALSO THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH CARE. ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS LIVE HAVE LIVED IN THE U. S. FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. MORE THAN HALF OR A MIX THAT IS FAMILIES MEANING UNDOCUMENTED PARENT OR GRANDPARENT. CAN TAKE THEIR CHILD OR GRANDCHILD TO THE DOCTOR WHEN THEY'RE SICK BUT THE PARENT A GRANDPARENT CANNOT DO THE SAME FOR THEMSELVES. THEY ARE ONLY ELIGIBLE AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. AND PREGNANCY CARE BUT THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE PREVENTATIVE CARE FOR CONDITIONS SUCH AS ASTHMA DIABETES OR HEART CONDITION. LEAVING THEM WITH THE LAST RESORT OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS ONCE THE CONDITIONS ARE AT THEIR WORST THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. FAR MORE TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES- THEY CONTRIBUTE OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL AND STATE TAXES TO FUND PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE. YET THEY ARE EXCLUDED THEMSELVES. UNDERLYING CONDITIONS SUCH AS ASTHMA AND HEART DISEASE CAN BE TREATED TO AVOID HIGHER COSTS ON THE SYSTEM AND AVOID SUFFERING AND OVERALL IT'S A BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH TO HAVE A HEALTHFUL HEALTHY. A COLLECTIVE SOCIETY. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED HOW DEVASTATING THE LACK OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS ESPECIALLY AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE SENIORS AND IMMIGRANTS HAS BEEN. THEY ARE NOT STATISTICS THEY ARE CALIFORNIANS THE COST OF DOING NOTHING IS FAR GREATER THAN THE COST OF PROVIDING COVERAGE. OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WORKS BEST PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WORKS BEST WHEN ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT- WE HAVE HERE PRESENT A WHOLE SAID DORIS GOT IT GARCIA LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR HEALTH ACCESS TO PROVIDE PUBLIC TESTIMONY.

UNDOCUMENTED OLDER ADULTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OR FULL SCHOOL MEDIC HOW. THAT PROVIDE ACCESS TO ROUTINE PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE. THEY ARE ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDICARE WHICH COVERS EMERGENCY ROOM CARE THE EMERGENCY ROOM IS THE LEAST EFFICIENT. MOST EXPENSIVE WAY TO PROVIDE CARE AND NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS COVERED UNDER FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL. AS A RESULT UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS REMAIN UNINSURED LIV STECKER DIE YOUNGER AND R. ONE MEDICAL EMERGENCY AWAY FROM FINANCIAL RUIN. OUR OLDER IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUP. CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM PUBLIC COVERAGE PROGRAMS PARTICULAR AREA RISKY RECOVER NINETEEN. AND THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE EXACERBATED CONDITIONS IF THEY EVEN SURVIVE THE VIRUS. BY EXPANDING COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED OLDER ADULTS WE CAN BE ON THE- THANK. BY EXPANDING COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED OLDER ADULTS WE CAN BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF HEALTH CARE EQUITY.

CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LONG- THE LEADER IN PROTECTING AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES WELL THESE EFFORTS HAVE HELPED MAINTAIN THIS RIGHT FOR DECADES THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS BARRIERS TO ACCESSING THESE SERVICES INCLUDING AFFORDABILITY. HEALTH PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER ABORTION SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA AS WE KNOW BUT THEY CAN STILL CHARGE HIGH DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS THAT CAN RANGE FROM FORTY DOLLARS TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. A FIVE YEAR STUDY CONDUCTED BYUCSF OF ONE THOUSAND WOMEN SEEKING ABORTION CARE AT THIRTY FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOUND THAT OVER HALF OF THE WOMEN HAD OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES. OF MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME SB TWO FORTY FIVE WILL REMOVE THIS BARRIER AND ALLOW ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS THEIR LEGAL RIGHT TO SERVICES BY ENSURING THAT HEALTH PLANS CAN'T REQUIRE COST SHARING. FOR THE SERVICES TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE DOCTORS THERE ROBERTS WITH THE BIXBY CENTER FOR GLOBAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AT UCSF. AND BELLA CAL MORE A CALIFORNIANS. WHO ACTUALLY FACE FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO ACCESSING CARE THANK YOU- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR SO YOU DO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND- HEAR THE WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. ON THE PHONE. WONDER OPENED. THANK GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN MEMBERS MY NAME IS SARAH ROBERTS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. I THINK THE IMPACT THE STATE LEVEL ABORTION POLICIES. AND A PUBLISHED MORE THAN FIFTY PEER REVIEWED ARTICLES ABOUT ABORTION INCLUDING MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THAT DIRECTLY EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF STATE LEVEL ABORTION POLICIES. MY RESEARCH AS WELL AS OTHER PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH FINDS THAT THE COSTS OF COURSE AND MY SIGNIFICANT BERRIER PEOPLE SAY BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW THE PERSON. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HAVING TO PAY THESE COSTS CAN IMPACT PEOPLE IF YOU BUY IT- IS COST EFFECTIVE OTHER AREAS OF PEOPLE'S LIVES. THE PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET HAVING TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY TO PAY FOR AN ABORTION OUT OF POCKET IF THE PEOPLE HAVE TO DO THINGS LIKE PUT OFF A FOR GROPING. RENT A BUYING SAID. SECOND COP INTERVIEW TO DELAY IT. AND ONE OF THE THIRTY THEY MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT HAVING TO RAISE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE ABORTION BUT- IT'S AND THEY WERE DELAYED. WHEN PEOPLE WORK THROUGH PORTION FUND YOUR FAMILY. THE MAN ABOUT THE PREGNANCY IT'S RAISE MONEY TO PAY FOR AN ABORTION. IT CAN TAKE AWHILE TO GET THE MONEY TOGETHER. IF PEOPLE ARE DELAYED INTO THE SECOND TRIMESTER THE COST OF AN ABORTION I THOUGHT. WHICH CAN THEN LEAD TO FURTHER DELAY WILL WORK IT'S A QUESTION OF MONEY. AS A TWENTY YEAR OLD EXPLAINED TO US ONE PART OF IT. I GET PAID EVERY WEEK. EVERY TIME I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IT ALL GETS TAKEN OUT IMPACT. THANK JUST UNDER THE AMOUNT I NEED. EVERY TIME I TRY TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT I'M SICK OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO PAY. THIRD MY PEOPLE CAME BURSTING COSTS BUT SOME DO NOT. SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE OF THE POPULATION RAISING THE MONEY I'M A PROFITABLE PERSON GOES UP SO MUCH IN THE MEANTIME THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT OR THE DELETE BUTTON TO BE BEYOND THE JUSTICE OPENED AT. THIRTEEN A PERSON CARE.EIGHT FOR THESE REASONS THAT YOU'RE HERE APART SB TWO FORTY FIVE. AND A AVAILABLE THE QUESTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE NUMBER MY NAME IS BALLOT HOW MORE AND I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AT COFFEE TEMPTED ENOUGH. TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC I WAS SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT I WAS PREGNANT- THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD LIVING THERE MY FIRST GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WHICH HAD ALREADY COST ME MY JOB IN SOCIAL LIFE. I THOUGHT NOBODY PREPARED TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A CHILD DURING SUCH UNCERTAIN TIMES. AND I MADE THE DECISION TO HAVE AN ABORTION. I FEDERAL AN APPOINTMENT AT MY LOCAL CLINIC AND MENTALLY PREPARED FOR THE EXPERIENCE I WOULD WONDER. WHAT I COULD NOT PREPARE FOR WAS A FINANCIAL BARRIER I FACE WHEN ACCESSING MY PORTION. OF THE DAY OF MY APPOINTMENT I LEARNED THAT UNDER MY COMMERCIAL INSURANCE POLICY. I WOULD NEED TO PAY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE THE PROCEDURE THAT DAY. THE COST COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED ME. AND I CONTEMPLATED HOW I COULD AFFORD THIS PROCEDURE IN ADDITION TO MY LIVING EXPENSES. I THEN UNDERSTOOD THE TRUTH ON THE BREAKING G. WITH ACCESSING AN ABORTION. I NEED A LONGER I WAITED THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT WOULD BE. FORCED TO MAKE AN IMPOSSIBLE DECISION THAT DAY CAN USE NEARLY ALL THE MONEY I HAD TO PAY FOR MY ABORTIONS. AFTER PAYING FOR THE PROCEDURE I WENT TO MY CAR. AND I THOUGHT FOR MYSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO KNEW THE DISTRESS CAUSED BY FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HEALTH CARE. OCULOMOTOR TIME IN LIFE THE FINANCIAL BARRIER I FIFTY TO COST SHARING ALMOST FORGOT. ME FROM ACCESSING THE CARE THAT I NEEDED. THE BURDEN OF THE TITANIC COST AFFECTED ME FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY FOR WEEKS AFTERWARD. THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR COST OF MY ABORTION INTENSIFIED BY FINANCIAL TROUBLES CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC. AN EXISTING SIX MONTHS AROUND ABORTION MAKE ME FEEL ISOLATED INVOICE PLUS. FINE GRATEFUL THAT I COULD UNDERGO A SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION FOR ME. I RECOGNIZE NOW THAT THE TRAUMA I ENCOURAGE YOU TO COST SHARING SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. I'M ASKING FOR SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TWO FORTY FIVE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THE OTHER CALIFORNIANS WILL NOT ENCOUNTER THE SAME FINANCIAL BARRIER I FACE WHEN ACCESSING MY PORTION. AND I CHOOSE TO SHARE MY STORY CONSERVATIVE AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS URGENTLY NEEDED TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES- REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION SO WHEN THEY'RE READY PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SUSAN PARNELL. I'M AN ATTORNEY FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE AND WE OPPOSE SB TWO FORTY FIVE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN CALIFORNIA'S BIRTH RATE HAS PLUMMETED BELOW REPLACEMENT LEVELS FROM TWO POINT TWO TO ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE ACCORDING TO US CENSUS BUREAU AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. A DECLINING BIRTHRATE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AFFECTING BOTH RACE AND ETHNICITY WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS IS MORE BABIES NOT MORE ABORTIONS. SB TWO FORTY FIVE WILL ENCOURAGE MORE ABORTIONS BY FORCING INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SUBSIDIZE COSTS MAKING ABORTION FREE FOR WOMEN NO DEDUCTIBLES NO CO PAY NO COST SHARING WHATSOEVER. CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES ALL PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER ABORTION THIS BILL FORCES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PICK UP THE COST SHARING AS WELL. ANY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY IS AN ECONOMIC INCENTIVE YOU GET MORE OF WHATEVER YOU SUBSIDIZE. THE BILL'S PREFERENCE FOR FREE ABORTION OVER OTHER TYPES OF HEALTH CARE IS INCONSISTENT SEXIST DISCRIMINATORY AND DOUBLE DOWN ON CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW. SB TWO FORTY FIVE IS INCONSISTENT WHY STOP AT ABORTION COPAYS WHY NOT FORCED INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ABSORB COPAYS FOR OTHER WOMEN'S HEALTH TREATMENTS LIKE PAP SMEARS HYSTERECTOMIES INFERTILITY OR EVEN CANCER. AND SB TWO FORTY FIVE IS SEXIST WHY NOT PUBLIC MEN'S REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES LIKE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION OR DISCECTOMY REVERSAL AND WHAT ABOUT SEX CHANGE OPERATIONS WHY IS ABORTION FREE. SB TWO FORTY FIVE IS DISCRIMINATORY MOST PREGNANCIES DO NOT END IN ABORTION SB TWO FORTY FIVE DOES NOT REQUIRE COMPANIES TO PAY FOR THE COST OF GIVING BIRTH FOR HER Q. DOT ITS SELECTIVELY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST FAMILIES AND WOMEN WHO WANT TO HAVE BABIES. SB TWO FORTY FIVE VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW. THE WELDON AMENDMENT CLEARLY STATES THAT HEALTH PLANS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO. PAY FOR ABORTIONS SLOUCHING THIS FEDERAL PROTECTION OF CONSCIENCE RIGHTS CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO INCLUDE COVERAGE FOR ABORTION EIGHTY TWO FORTY FIVE. DOWN ON THIS VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW BY REDISTRIBUTING MORE FUNDS FROM PRIVATE COMPANIES TO ABORTION PROVIDERS IN A BID TO ADVANCE A SPECIALIZED MEDICAL CARE PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE. THESE REASONS WE URGING. NO VOTE OFTEN TO FOR FIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU. NO WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR AND OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIDGET BLAIR I AM THE CEO OF HOLLISTER PREGNANCY CENTER I HAVE HAD THREE FIRST TRIMESTER SUCTION THE ANTI ABORTION AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN AS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL I BECAME PREGNANT I WAS NAIVE AND IMMATURE A CHILD I WENT TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO HAVE AN ABORTION AND WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED I SIGNED UP FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL AND HAVE A FREE ABORTION WITHOUT MY PARENTS CONSENT. DURING THE SUCTION ABORTION I THOUGHT THE COLLECTION BOTTLE FILLED WITH BLOOD I WAS TRAUMATIZED UPON BEING DISCHARGED THE NURSE ASKED IF I WANTED BIRTH CONTROL SEDATED AND IN SHOCK FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE ABORTION SEX WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND AND I ANSWERED NO THE NURSE REPLIED ODDS ARE YOU WILL BE BACK AFTER THE ABORTION I SPIRALED INTO DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE I BECAME PREGNANT AGAIN AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN. THE PAIN AND SHAME I CARRIED COMPOUNDED WHEN I FOUND MYSELF BACK AT THE CLINIC HE SECOND TIME I BECAME DEPRESSED AND BEGAN STRUGGLING IN SCHOOL I CUT CUT CLASSES AND HAD TO GO TO A LOCAL JUNIOR COLLEGE TO EARN EXTRA CREDITS TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I FOUND MYSELF PREGNANT A THIRD TIME I WENT TO THE CLINIC AN EMOTIONAL WRECK I WAS EMOTIONALLY FRAGILE AND UNSTABLE I FELT HOPELESS I DID NOT RECEIVE AN ASSESSMENT REGARDING MY EMOTIONAL HEALTH. NOR WAS I OFFERED ANY TYPE OF PREGNANCY OUTCOME OPTIONS I WAS NOT ASKED WHY I WANTED AN ABORTION ON A MEDICAL TABLE I CRIED VULNERABLE ON MY BACK WITH FEET IN STIRRUPS THE NURSE STOOD OVER ME AND SAID YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS TO YOU I SAID NO. THE NURSE SAID IT WILL BE OVER SOON I WAS INVISIBLE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS YES THE CLINIC PERFORMED THE ABORTION EVEN THOUGH I SAID NO BEFORE THE PROCEDURE STARTED THEY DENIED MY RIGHT. TO CHOOSE THE TONIGHT MY RIGHT TO CHANGE TO MY MIND. SB TWO FIVE WE'LL SEE ABORTION INDUSTRY'S GREED FOR FINANCIAL PROFIT. SB TWO FORTY FIVE WILL MAKE ABORTIONS TOTALLY FREE. THAT WILL OPEN THE DOOR FOR ABORTION CLINICS TO VICTIMIZE MORE WOMEN JUST LIKE ME. FREE ABORTION WILL INCREASE THE RISK OF COERCION TO WOMEN FACING UNPLANNED PREGNANCY DURING ONE OF THE MOST DELICATE AND FRAGILE TIMES OF THEIR LIVES. SB TWO FORTY FIVES FREE ABORTION PROVISION THREATENS A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO SAY NO OR CHANGED HER MIND WHEN SHE IS IN THE CLINIC FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO VOTE NOW ON SB TWO FORTY FIVE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY JUST YOUR NAME POSITION AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. A GREG BIRD WITH THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL- IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU.

THANK YOU NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN MEMBERS CARILLO. THE QUESTION A COMMONER BAKER HAD. YEP MOVE THE BILL MR RODRIGUEZ SECOND MY MISS CAREER OKAY. SERVICE CHARGES IN A LITTLE CLARIFICATION I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL AT TO THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT HOW MANY LIVES ABORTIONS HAVE ACTUALLY SAVED. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN'S LIVES AND THE FACT THAT THIS CONTINUES TO BE A CONVERSATION NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE NATION IS QUITE FRANKLY APPALLING IN THE YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE ISSUE BEFORE US IS AN ISSUE OF EQUITY AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE THE FACT THAT. WOMEN WHO ARE MORE AFFLUENT DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. THE COST OF AN ABORTION OR HAVING TO PAY FOR ANY KIND OF. COPAYMENT AT CETERA BRINGS REALLY THE QUESTION THAT THIS CONTINUES TO BE. AN ISSUE WHERE POOR WOMEN AND WORKING CLASS WOMEN. ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY DISADVANTAGED WHEN IT COMES TO EQUITY AND HEALTH CARE IN EQUITY AND- AND COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND SO I THINK. THIS IS NOT ONLY A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE IMPACT. ON WOMEN'S HEALTH. BUT ALSO A CONVERSATION ABOUT EQUITY AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND- I AM PROUD TO BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD LOVE TO BE CONSIDERED. AS A CO AUTHOR AND I WOULD ALSO ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE AYE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO ONE WE HAVE A MOTION BY- SO MANY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ SECOND BY MISS CARILLO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WHICH LIKE THE CLOSE CENTER GONZALEZ THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD SHE SAID IT SO ELOQUENTLY THIS IS ABOUT HEALTH EQUITY REPRODUCTIVE ACCESSIBILITY- AS WE KNOW ABORTIONS AND FORTUNATELY FOR DEDUCTIBLES AND COST SHARING CAN BE COSTLY AND IT'S ALSO A TIME SENSITIVE PROCEDURE FOR MANY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO DESPERATELY NEED THIS. I WANT TO THANK BELLA CAL MORE FOR SHARING HER STORY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOOK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES. AGUIAR-CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY AYE GARCIA GARCIA I BIGELOW. BURKE BURKE I CARILLO CARILLO AYE FLORA FLOOR NO MAIENSCHEIN. MCCARTY NAZARIAN NAZARIAN AYE RIVAS. RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ ICE SANTIAGO. WALDRON WALDRON NOW. SEVENTY TWO YUBA SEVEN VOTES WILL BE THERE WILL CALL FOR YOU THANKS VERY MUCH SENATOR. SENATOR GLAZERS. SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY FOR EVERYONE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE A- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH WITH US CLOSELY ON AMENDMENTS TO- ON THIS BILL TO IRON OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS. AND ADD TO ITS ROBUST PRIVACY PROTECTIONS- THOSE EFFORTS HAVE PERSUADED THE ACLU. THE PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE AND OTHER PRIVACY ADVOCATES IN THE CMA. TO WITHDRAW THEIR OPPOSITION. YOUR STAFF AS ACCURATELY DRAFTED THE AMENDMENTS REFLECT IN OUR CONVERSATIONS AND I ACCEPT THEM HAS PRESENTED. SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY FOUR POSES MODEST CHANGES TO BEING TO BEGIN CLOSING THE DATA GAP THAT HAS KEPT US FROM FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE METHODS WE USE. TO CONTROL IT. MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER COVERT NINETEEN TOOK THE FIRST OF MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND LIVES IN CALIFORNIA. WE STILL HAVE VERY LITTLE SCIENCE TO EXPLAIN WHAT CONDITIONS. MAKE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS MORE OR LESS LIKELY. AND WE HAVE LITTLE DATA TO SHOW WHICH OF THE STEPS WE TOOK TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS WORKED. AND WHICH DID NOT. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND WE AS POLICY MAKERS. HAVE BEEN LARGELY FLYING BLIND. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST NOTED THAT ARE CODED RESPONSE EFFORT FROM OUTDATED DATA COLLECTION ANALYSIS AND REPORTING SYSTEMS THE ANALYSTS RECOMMENDED THAT WE UNDERTAKE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THOSE SYSTEMS. AS A PART OF A SWEEPING AFTER ACTION LOOK AT HOW OUR STATE DEALT WITH THIS UNPRECEDENTED THREAT AND I AGREE WITH THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A SMALL STEP IN THAT DIRECTION IT DOES TWO THINGS. FIRST THE BILL WOULD ADD DETAILS TO THE QUESTIONS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ASK THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE. SO THAT IT THE INFORMATION GATHERED WOULD BE MORE USEFUL IN STOPPING THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. AND SECOND THE BILL MAKES CHANGES TO AN EXISTING SYSTEM FOR SHARING DATA WITH BONA FIDE RESEARCHERS. SO THAT OUR BEST SCIENTISTS CAN STUDY THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN REAL TIME. AND PROVIDE US WITH THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO CREATE A SPECIAL PANEL DURING EMERGENCIES. TO EVALUATE RESEARCH REQUESTS AND EITHER APPROVE OR DENY THEM IN FIFTEEN DAYS. THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THIS EXPEDITED PROCESS ABIDE BY ALL OF THE EXISTING PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN LAW. AND WE EVEN ADD SOME NEW ONES. THIS CAN BE DONE WHILE STILL BEING MINDFUL THAT IN A PANDEMIC. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY. THIS COSTING CALIFORNIANS THEIR LIVES. MEMBERS IT'S TOO LATE TO SAVE THOSE LIVES THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED AWAY DURING THIS TERRIBLE PANDEMIC BUT- YOU KNOW IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT ONE. AND THIS BILL WOULD HELP US DO THAT WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY BY TELEPHONE IS DR JEFFREY KLAUSNER AN EXPERT IN THIS FIELD. PROFESSOR OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WILL GO TO YOUR WITNESS IN SUPPORT. HELLO MY NAME IS DR JEFFREY KLAUSNER. FACTOR THING INSPECTIONS DISEASE RESISTANT MEDICAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND PROFESSOR OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA KECK SCHOOL OF MEDICINE I'M A FORMER SAN FRANCISCO DEPUTY HEALTH OFFICER AND FORMER CDC MEDICAL OFFICER MISTAKE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SEVEN FOUR FOUR WHICH WOULD ADD NEW DATA ELEMENTS TO COMMUNICABLE RESPIRATORY DISEASE REPORTING. REQUIRE THE STATE TO SECURELY SHARE THE IDENTIFIED DATA TO ENABLE CALIFORNIA BASED ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS TO PERFORM EPIDEMIOLOGIC ANALYSES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RESPONSE TO CALL THE NINETEEN HAS BEEN ABJECT FAILURE. OVER SIXTY THOUSAND- THE 70% OR DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS OF COLOR. THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS THAT FAILURE IS IN THE POOR YOU TO THAT PRETTY MUCH OF DATA AND THE INABILITY OF THE STATE TO USE AVAILABLE DATA TO CREATE A TARGET RESPONSE TO FOCUSED INTERVENTIONS TO LIMIT THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY BROAD BASED STATEWIDE POLICY. BECAUSE THE DECADES OF PLANNING CUTS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THIS STATE HAS LIMITED CAPACITY TO ANALYZE COLLECTED DATA FURTHERMORE THE DATA COLLECTED ARE INCOMPLETE AND INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OF SCIENCE BASS RESPONSE. THE LACK OF GOOD DATA RESULTED IN THE MEDICAL ACTIVISTS SOCIAL WORKERS AND THE FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT TESTING IN THE WORK FORCE WHICH COULD HAVE IDENTIFIED CASES EARLIER AND PREVENTED THE- SPREAD OF INFECTION. ON THE FLIP SIDE THE INDISCRIMINATE CLOSURE ABOUT DOOR SPACES PLAYGROUNDS SCHOOLS AND RECOMMENDATIONS LEVINE FOUNDED INTERVENTIONS LIKE DEEP CLEANING ACTIVITIES AND TEMPERATURE SCREENING WE'RE NOT BASED ON GOOD DATA. BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE ANY SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY FOUR WOULD BE A STEP TOWARD RIGHTING THE STATE'S SPELL PUBLIC OFFICE THEM BY ADDING RELEVANT RESPIRATORY DISEASE EXPOSURE ELEMENTS. COLLECTIVELY ADDED DATA ELEMENTS ARE NOT A BURDEN TO PRACTICING CLINICIANS DOCTORS ARE TAUGHT TO COLLECT THOSE EXPOSURES OCCUPATION WORKPLACE HOUSING TYPE DENSITY TRAVEL INDUSTRY MEDICAL SCHOOL. AS PART OF A MEDICAL HISTORY FURTHERMORE SUCH DATA ARE OFTEN SELF REPORTED BY PATIENTS UPON CLINIC REGISTRATION AND ENTERED INTO THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS BY STAFF SIMILAR TO RECORDING INSURANCE INFORMATION. OR HOME ADDRESS. I THINK IN THE NINETEEN OUT THERE. HAVE BEEN SWING BLIND. IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE HAS BEEN SEVERE. BETTER DATA AND SHE ACT AGAIN PRESERVE INTO PRIVACY. PROTECTING HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I BELIEVE WE HAVE A WITNESS- REGISTERED WITH US IN OPPOSITION. YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS PATTY BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE PHYSICIAN HEALTH OFFICERS. APPOINTED IN THE CITY AND COUNTY JURISDICTION HOW OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE REMOVING THEIR OPPOSITION THAT THE AMENDMENTS PRESENTED TODAY UNFORTUNATELY THE HEALTH OFFICERS REMAIN RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR. WE ARE SYMPATHETIC WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT YOU JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS THE WAY TO GET THERE WE PROPOSE VARIOUS AMENDMENTS. BUT HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. BILL KOMPLETT THE DISEASE OF TO. THIS IS HOW MEDICAL PROVIDERS WHAT LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A CASE OF THE DISEASE IN THEIR JURISDICTION. AND THAT PROCESS HOW PUBLIC HEALTH MONITORS DEFEAT CATION. IF WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE CASE WE CAN'T ENACT PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS LIKE-ISOLATION QUARANTINE AND CONTACT TRACING CONTACT RACING AND PASSING A CONTACT. BECAUSE IT. THESE REPORTING WE FEEL THAT IT WILL LEAD TO LESS DISEASE REPORTING UNLESS STATE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH NOT MORE. IT'S A WE RECOGNIZE IT HARD IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE A NEGATIVE SO WE CAN'T QUANTIFY HOW MUCH DATA WE DON'T HAVE. AND WE BUT WE DO KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE DECADES THAT PROVIDERS DON'T ALWAYS REPORT CASES TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THE HARDER WE MAKE IT TO REPORT THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO DO SO. AND THAT RESULT IN LESS DATA AND WORST PUBLIC HEALTH. EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO QUANTIFY HOW MANY CASES ARE REPORTED EACH YOU KNOW THAT. EVEN ONE CASE GOES UNREPORTED AT THE WRONG TIME AND IN THE WRONG PLACE. CAN SPARK AN OUTBREAK. NATALIE OPPOSE SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR AND THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY THANK YOU.

WAS EXPOSED BY CO BUT IT WAS THAT- THAT AND- SO I FULLY SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO- AND IF WE FIND THAT THIS BECOMES AN IMPEDIMENT IN THE FUTURE THAT THERE IS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. THE BEAUTY OF THIS LEGISLATURE IS THAT WE CAN ADJUST AND MAKE CHANGES IN THE FUTURE BUT I FULLY SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS TO COLLECT MORE INFORMATION MORE DATA SO THAT WE CAN RESPOND- TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SHOULD ANOTHER- RESPIRATORY DISEASE OUTBREAK HAPPENED- SHOULD THE BILL PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE A MOTION I LOST TRACK OF IT THAT WAS A MOTION BY MISS AGUIAR-CURRY AND SECOND I MISS WALDRON MOTION IS DUE PASS AS AMENDED TO JUDICIARY- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR GLAZERS THANK YOU CHAIR WOULD TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND. KIND WORDS. IS THE QUESTION THAT WE GET UP FROM SO MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS GUYS WHAT DID WE DO WRONG WHAT CAN WE DO DIFFERENTLY. WE HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE SOMETHING WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN OUR LIFETIME. BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT- OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE BEEN REAL HEROES- IN SO MANY WAYS. REALLY THE TAKEN THE SLINGS AND ARROWS THEY'VE DONE THEIR BEST WORK AND THEY'VE SAVED A LOT OF LIVES SO. IT'S NOT EASY TO HAVE A BILL BEFORE YOU THAT DOESN'T HAVE THEIR FULL SUPPORT BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS MEMBERS. THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT RIGHT NOW AND AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE. THERE ARE THREE QUESTIONS AND THEY'RE DEALING WITH JOB HOUSING SITUATION AND TRAVEL ALL THIS BILL DOES IS PROVIDE MORE CLEAR QUESTIONS TO BE ASKING PLACE OF WHAT'S THERE TODAY. NOT GOING TO BE COMPLICATED. AND AS THE CHAIR SAID I THINK WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO DO OUR WORK BETTER. BUT THE DATA THAT WE'RE COLLECTING. IS NOT WHAT WE NEED AS POLICY MAKERS TO MAKE OUR BEST DECISIONS. AND WE WANT TO DO BETTER I KNOW THAT I THINK THIS BILL HELP THAT IF IT'S EVER NEEDED IN THE FUTURE WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

HEY THANK YOU SO MUCH AT YOUR WORD MEMBERS HAVE. PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THREE OH SIX. WE ARE AT A CRISIS POINT WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS OF THIS COUNTRY. BACK TO CCS EMITS A ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE IN THE US HAVE HAD. HAVE AN STD BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. OF A SIXTY EIGHT MILLION STD INFECTIONS REPORTED RATES OF SYPHILIS CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA- UP FORTY PERCENT SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. THIS CRISIS AFFECTS COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUT BUT CALIFORNIA YOUTH PEOPLE OF COLOR GAVE BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED FACT OVER HALF OF ALL STDS IN THE STATE ARE IN THE STATE OF REPORTED AMONG YOUTH FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. AFTER AMERICANS ARE 5100% MORE LIKELY TO CONTRACT UNREIN COMMITTEE AT INTO WHAT COUNTERPARTS. THESE DISPARITIES ARE EXPECTED TO WORSEN AS A RESULT OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIA HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST SURPLUS RATE IN THE NATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE SURPLUS RATE AMONG WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE INCREASED BY OVER 7100% ONE OF THE HARDEST DATAPOINTS. FOR ME TO SQUARE WITH HAS TO DO WITH THE RATE OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS A DISEASE WE THOUGHT WE GOT RID OF BACK IN VICTORIAN ERA WE INVENTED PENICILLIN IN THE EARLY PART OF CENTURY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE BABIES WERE BORN WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS 89100% INCREASE FROM TWENTY TWELVE VECTOR TWENTY STILLBIRTHS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DISEASE. BACK HALF OF CAN JOSEPH LISTER A CASES OCCUR BECAUSE OF GAPS IN TESTING AND TREATMENT DURING PRENATAL CARE. AND THIS BILL SEEKS CLOSE THAT GAP REQUIRING ADDITIONAL SCREENINGS. THIS BILL ALSO INCREASES ACCESS TO FEDSCOOP SCREENING AND TREATMENT BY EXPANDING SCREENING FOR CONVULSIVE LIST OF THE MENTION. OPENING UP ACCESS TO THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM INCREASING THE USE OF CALIFORNIA'S EXPEDITED PARTNER THERAPY. PERMITTING HIV COUNSELOR SENATORS ADMINISTERED RAPID STD TESTS REQUIRING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HOME STD TESTING. CALIFORNIA HAS LAGGED AND ACTING COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES INCREASE ACCESS STD SCREENING AND TREATMENT. INDEPENDENT BECAUSE EXACERBATED STD RATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOU CAN IMAGINE WILL HAPPEN AS WE RE OPEN. SB THREE OH SIX SIX A COOPERATIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S STD CRISIS. BY EXPANDING ACCESS THE STD CARE AND EQUITABLE WAY ESPECIALLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES- PLEASE- MADAM OPERATOR WHEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR THE WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU BOTH FIND THEIR OPEN. GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. THIS IS DR- GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS DR J. GLAD STEEN I AM THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER A PELE HEALTH IN LOS ANGELES AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE STATE BILL. CALIFORNIA AND INDEED THE NATION WAS ALREADY SEEING RISING CASES OF STDS BEFORE THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THOSE OF US WORKING IN THE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH FIELDS ARE CONCERNED DFT CRISIS HAS LIKELY GROWN WORSE OVER THE PAST YEAR SINCE THE PANDEMIC HAS BEGUN. PUBLIC HEALTH SAFF HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATELY FOCUSED ON THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. BUT DOING SO DIVERTED PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES AWAY FROM STD SCREENING AND TREATMENT. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT YET HAVE A LOT OF CONCRETE DATA ON THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE STATE'S A CD CRISIS WE DO HAVE CONCERNING SIGNS THAT THE STD EPIDEMIC HAS WORSENED. IN ORDER TO PREVENT ONGOING COURT INCREASING NUMBERS OF STDS. WE NEED TO REMAIN VIGILANT IF WE DO NOT REMAIN VIGILANT. WE MAY HAVE INCREASING DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT STRAINS OF GONORRHEA WHICH ACCORDING TO THE CDC ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO EMERGE IN THIS COUNTRY. IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UP DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. LISTEN ALERT ABOUT RISING NUMBERS OF CASES OF DISSEMINATED GONOCOCCAL INFECTIONS THIS IS A MORE AGGRESSIVE MANIFESTATION OF GONORRHEA WHICH IF NOT TREATED PROMPTLY AND APPROPRIATELY. CAN LEAD TO MORE SEVERE COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING THE ROOTS OF ARTHRITIS AND RARELY. INFECTIONS OF THE HEART VALVES WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO TREAT AND POTENTIALLY FATAL. ANOTHER WARNING SIGN THAT WAS JUST MENTIONED OF THE PROGRESSING STD EPIDEMIC IS CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. AND IN THIS LAST YEAR WE SAW IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ONE HUNDRED CASES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS THIS OCCURS WHEN SYPHILIS IN A PREGNANT WOMAN IS NOT TREATED APPROPRIATELY AND CAN LEAD TO PERMANENT BIRTH DEFECTS IN THE BABY. DOES ONE HUNDRED CASES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WERE EVEN HIGHER THAN THE INCREASE THAT WE SEE ACROSS THE STATE IT'S AT THOUSAND TWELVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. A CRISIS OF THIS MAGNITUDE REQUIRES A COORDINATED AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND STATE BILL THREE OH SIX IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD GETTING A HANDLE ON THE STATE'S STD EPIDEMIC. THE GROWING A CITY CRISIS NO DOUBT AFFECTS ALL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUT CALIFORNIA YOUTH. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS CONTINUE TO BE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. NOTABLY THE BILL WOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO STD TESTING AND TREATMENT THROUGH THE STATE'S FAMILY PACKED PROGRAM. TO INCLUDE ALL PEOPLE WITH STD SCREENING NEEDS. CURRENTLY I THINK THAT FAMILY PACKED COVERS AT TV SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS BUT ONLY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A FAMILY PLANNING VISIT. THE INDIVIDUALS MOST NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE STRUCTURAL INEQUITY R. L. G. B. T. Q. CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE REPORTED BEING BEEN TURNED AWAY OR OUT TO PAY FOR THEIR ASSIDUOUS SERVICES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT NEED COMPREHENSIVE CON CONTRACEPTION. AND WERE THEREFORE INELIGIBLE FOR FAMILY PACK SERVICES ALSO EXCLUDED OR THOSE WHO MAY FALL OUTSIDE OF THEIR CHILDBEARING YEARS. EXPANDING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR STD SERVICES UNDER FAMILY PACKED PROVIDE THE FEASIBLE COST EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE PATHWAY TO INCREASE THAT TV COVERAGE RATHER THAN CREATING AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE PROGRAM. SB THREE OH SIX INCLUDES A NUMBER OF OTHER PROVISIONS TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S STD CRISIS INCLUDING LIABILITY PROTECTIONS TO INCREASE USE OF EXPEDITED PARTNER THERAPY. WIRING SYPHILIS SCREENING DURING THE THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY TO HELP BRING DOWN THESE RATES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND COVERAGE AS WE JUST HEARD OF THE IN HOME HIV AND STD TESTING. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE SCOPE OF THE STATE THIRTY CRISIS REQUIRES A BOLD AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH SB THREE OH SIX IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD CREATING A MORE EQUITABLE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO SED TESTING AND TREATMENT. KEEP THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS. FIVE THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JIM ROBINSON AND I AM ALSO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I'M REPRESENTING BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS. AND BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS ACTION PROJECT WE ARE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ORGANIZATION WITH OFFICES IN LOS ANGELES AND STOCKTON WHAT THE MISSION DEDICATED TO BLACK WOMEN AND GIRLS. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS FOR OVER A DECADE NOW AND MY ENTIRE TENURE HAS BEEN. WHITE A CRISIS IMPACTING DISPROPORTIONATELY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION RATES THAT ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST POINT. IN THIRTY YEARS WHAT CHLAMYDIA RATES UP TWO HUNDRED AND 11% AND GONORRHEA RATES UP INCREASED ABOUT 9100% BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN. THESE RATES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING BLACK TEENAGERS THANK WHERE YOU. HI STD RATES ARE CANARIAN AND OUR WHOLE MIND THAT IS LETTING US KNOW THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE BROKEN AND WE ARE FAILING YOUNG PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ISSUES SUCH AS INCARCERATIONS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND LACK OF ACCESS THE ECONOMIC MOBILITY ARE ALL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THE HIGH STD RATE BUT LUCKILY WE HAVE TOOLS TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE. SB THREE OH SIX. IS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING AT THE RATE INCLUDING EXPANDING ACCESS THE L. D. P. L. G. B. T. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY NOT ELIGIBLE TO GET STD SCREENING AND TREATMENT. ENCOURAGING THE USE. OF EXPEDITED PARTNER TREATMENT. A SOLUTION THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE REINFECTION RATE. EXPANDING RAPID TESTING AND OTHER INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES LIKE AT HOME TESTING AS WELL AS UPDATING STUFF WITH TESTING PROTOCOLS FOR PREGNANT PEOPLE. THIS LAST POINT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT 15% OF PEOPLE WITH THE FLU IN THE STATE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE PREGNANT. AND TWENTY TWO BABIES DIED OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WELL IF SOMETHING WE KNOW CAN BE TREATED WITH ANNA ANTIBIOTICS THAT COST LESS THAN A DOLLAR BUT LACK OF TREATMENT CAN CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE. THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUED NEW GUIDELINES. RESPONDING TO THE ALARMING INCREASE OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND HIV TO DO THIRD TRIMESTER CASTING. A RECOMMENDATION IN LINE WITH THE OLD. CD PH WHEN THEY ARE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. THAT HAVE SEEN RISES AND OR RISK AND OR AT RISK COMMUNITIES WHICH IS FOR THE- OUR. THERE ARE DIFFICULT INCOME IS THAT ARE. IS FACING COMING SURE WE ARE FORWARD TO MORE THAN JUST EQUITABLE CAL HOWEVER. THIS IS OF THOSE COMPLICATED ISSUES WE HAVE THE TWO RESEARCH AND WHERE WITH ALL TO TURN THE CORNER ON THESE ISSUES ALL WE'RE MISSING. IS OUR WILL TO DO SO THIS IS WHY I ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES ON SB THREE OH SIX. A VITAL STEP IN ADDRESSING STD RATES IN OUR STATE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISS WALDRON. FROM THE DOCTOR AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS YOU KNOW THIS PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT COSTS AND THINGS. HAVEN'T BEEN ON HEALTH COMMITTEE NOW FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS OR SO. WHEN I LOOK AT BILLS LIKE THIS I THINK. YOU KNOW. IF WE KNEW PEOPLE STATUS IF WE KNEW THE YOU KNOW IF THE INFECTION RATES ARE OR PEOPLE COULD BE TESTED. THERE'S A COST TO THAT. BUT WOULD YOU SAY OR HAS IT BEEN LOOKED AT EVER WHAT WOULD BE THE COST SAVINGS. OF ACTUALLY GETTING THIS INFORMATION AND TREATING PEOPLE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. AND AVOIDING THE COST AND THINGS THAT COME DOWN THE PIPELINE. THAT TEND TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE I MEAN I'M JUST. YOU KNOW IN A BILL LIKE THIS ONE IF. KIND OF THE FLOW OF THAT TYPE OF THING BECAUSE IT DOES COST TO HAVE THE KIDS AND PROCESSING LAB AND EVERYTHING BUT- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PATIENT. THE ABILITY TO KNOW YOU KNOW STATUS AND OTHER THINGS TO GET TREATMENT THERE'S DEFINITELY OF THE COST OR SAVINGS TO THAT AS WELL. NOTHING THANK YOU SO MUCH AS CENTER WALDRON I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRING UP THAT POINT BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE THERE'S A BENEFIT TO. PEOPLE BEING ABOUT THE TESTED AND GETTING TREATMENT THESE ARE ALL TREATABLE RIGHT THE OTHER THING I'D POINT OUT AS THESE ARE INFECTIOUS. SO ALSO WHEN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THEY SPREAD IT TO OTHER PEOPLE SO NOT ONLY OF COURSE THERE'S POTENTIALLY GREATER COSTS ASSOCIATED THIS IN VIOLATION MENTION THINGS LIKE CHLAMYDIA GONORRHEA CAN CAUSE THINGS LIKE INFERTILITY AND OTHER TYPES OF- YOU KNOW THOSE OTHER SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE WE TALK ABOUT SYPHILIS AND LEADING TO CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. WHICH CN LEAD TO NOW I STILL BIRDS BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY PERMANENT- OF INJURY TO THE- TO THE BABY SO. THESE ARE THINGS WE LIKE TO PREVENT. AS AND ALSO WOULD LIKE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD THE DISEASE AS WELL AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THINGS LIKE EXPEDITED PARTNER THERAPY AS WELL AS OF COURSE- PAYING FOR HOME TESTING BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE TESTED. FIND OUT GET THEM TREATED AND THAT'S AND IN THE LONG RUN I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO BE BETTER HEALTH BUT ALSO ACTUALLY- LOWER SPENDING AS WELL FOR HEALTHCARE. ANYONE ELSE. OUR THERE'S NO MOTION IN. WHICH I CAN MAKE. WITH A MOTION AND A CHORUS OF SECOND SO MOTIONFAMOUS AGUIAR-CURRY A SECOND BY MR RODRIGUEZ I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD CENTER PAN- I KNOW IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE BACK TO THE FUTURE IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE- OF THE- I KNOW IN MY OWN DISTRICT THERE ARE THERE AREAS WHERE WE'VE SEEN ALARMING INCREASES AND STDS AND- AND THESE ARE DISEASES THAT ARE PREVENTABLE- AND THE SPREAD IS SIGNIFICANT AND QUICK AND THE OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE ARE. ARE ARE A REALLY PRETTY POOR IF YOU'RE NOT TREATED WELL SEPT I DO BELIEVE THAT- IN THE LONG RUN BY CATCHING THESE DISEASES EARLY PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF IT WE ARE GOING TO SAVE MONEY FOR THE SYSTEM ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW THERE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SPEND A SAFE AND THAT IS THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT. ALSO KIND OF POINTS TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGESWE HAVE OUR ENTIRE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN UNDER UNDER ASSAULT AND SIEGE AND HAS BEEN UNDER FUNDED FOR MANY MANY YEARS WHICH IS WHY YOU AND I HAVE BEEN PUSHING SO HARD. FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SPENDING IN INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT- AND SO- WITH THAT- WE DO HAVE A MOTION THE SECOND- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE- THE DOCTOR WOULD YOUR LEADERSHIP AND- AND PUBLIC HEALTH SO THANK YOU I'M I THINK THE- THE COMMITTEE AS WELL INTERSECT WE OFTEN AYE VOTE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. PRESENTING SB TWO FIVE FIVE WHICH WILL PROTECT EVERY TO FREELANCE COMMON LAW TV COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES. FROM LOSING THEIR EXISTING QUALITY AT NO COST INSURANCE RESULTING FROM. A SINGLE A RECENT CHANGE IN LAW. FREELANCE EMPLOYMENT IS THE BACKBONE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. AND BECAUSE FREELANCE FILMMAKERS ARE HIRED ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS. AND MAY HAVE DOZENS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTION COMPANY EMPLOYERS OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR. THEY HAVE NO MEANS TO QUALIFY FOR A REGULAR EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS. TO FILL THIS VOID THE PRODUCERS HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN. FULLY INSURED EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLAN WAS FORMED TO PROVIDE. HEALTH BENEFITS AT NO COST TO NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED ELIGIBLE. COMMON LAW EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEES OF THE TELEVISION COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION INDUSTRY. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS RECENT. CHANGE IN LEGISLATION. THE FREELANCERS ARE NOW IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING THAT INSURANCE- SB TWO FIVE FIVE WILL CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS PLAN CONTINUES. ON THE PHONE TODAY I HAVE SHOWN COOLEY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PLANT AND BONNIE GOLDFARB THE OWNER OF A PRODUCTION COMPANY AND A COMMISSIONER ON THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PER PORTANTINO- WE'RE GOING TO OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE. BOTH SIDES ARE OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF SB TWO FIFTY FIVE MY NAME IS SEAN COOLEY AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PRODUCERS HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN THE BILL'S SPONSOR ALL REFERRED TO US BY OUR ACRONYM THE PHD P. P. THREE P. WAS STARTED AS A WAY FOR EMPLOYERS IN THE TELEVISION COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO THEIR FULL TIME W. TWO FREELANCE EMPLOYEES OR OTHERWISE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR EMPLOYER HEALTH PLAN. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAVE PROVIDED FREE HIGH QUALITY HEALTH COVERAGE AND CURRENTLY INSURED TWELVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA THE LANCERS WELL PARTICIPATION IN THE FREE LUNCH PROGRAM IS MANDATORY OF ALL OF OUR TWO HUNDRED PLUS PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS OPTIONAL NON FREELANCE GAP COVERAGE IS AVAILABLE OF WHICH 38% OF OUR EMPLOYERS PARTICIPATE. 70% OF OUR TOTAL COVERED EMPLOYEES ARE FREELANCERS. YOU TOO CAN EVEN DIE NOT ON TO THE LIVES OF THESE FREELANCERS BUT I BELIEVE TO THE STATE AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN A WEEK OF THE GOVERNOR STAY AT HOME ORDERS THE PLAN IMPLEMENTED A SERIES OF COVERED NINETEEN RELIEF MEASURES. EXTENDING COVERAGE KOREANS FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN MONTH DURATIONS TO ENSURE NO ONE LOST COVERAGE DUE TO THE SHUTDOWN OF THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION INDUSTRY THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. HE WENT ALL OUT OF POCKET FEES SUCH AS ALREADY HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED DEPENDENCIES AND ISSUE THE 20% DISCOUNT ON ALL COBRA PREMIUMS FROM APRIL FIRST THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. IF ANYONE LOST COVERAGE IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE RELIEF MEASURES. WE SUBSIDIZE COUPLE PREMIUMS BY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. BECAUSE IT HEALTHY RESERVES INCLUDING GOVERNANCE THE PLAN WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE A LIFESAVING FINANCIAL SAFETY NET TO ALL OF OUR COVERED FREELANCERS AT NO COST TO THE STATE. IS EXAMPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY TAKING CARE OF ITSELF IS TYPICAL THE PGP STORY. THERE'S NO SCENARIO IN WHICH THE WORKER OR FOR THAT MATTER THE EMPLOYER OR THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. BENEFITS OF PEACE FREELANCERS ARE FORCED TO THE OPEN MARKET TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR INSURANCE THE EMPLOYER IS WILLING TO PROVIDE IT HAS PROVIDED. FOR FREE FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT SB TWO FIFTY FIVE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. ALSO BEEN NOTIFIED THAT SEVERAL OF OUR TEACHERS HAVE HAD TO DROP OFF SO APOLOGIES IF THAT LINE- IF THAT- MINUS LITTLETON. THANK YOU.

THE P. H. B. P. PROVIDE FREE EMPLOYER PAID HEALTH COVERAGE TO OUR FREELANCE EMPLOYEES. WHICH ENABLES US TO KEEP AND MAINTAIN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA AND IT KEEPS EVERYONE WORKING HERE WITH THE CREW THAT HAS PAID HEALTH INSURANCE. WE HAVE THE BEST CRUISE IN THE WORLD HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF OUR MAIN CHALLENGES INCLUDES OTHER STATES VYING FOR THE ANNUAL ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SPENT. IN CALIFORNIA ON MARSHALL PRODUCTION EACH YEAR WE CAN'T RISK FORCING OUR FREELANCERS TO THE OPEN MARKET TO REPLACE. THEIR CURRENT EMPLOYER FUNDED HEALTH PLAN. THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT AND THOSE INCREASED COSTS WILL BE PASSED ON TO OUR CLIENTS RESULTING IN MORE PRODUCTION HEADING OUT OF STATE. BATES B. P. IS DOING THE RIGHT THING BY PROVIDING EMPLOYER PAID HEALTH CARE TO COMMERCIAL FREELANCERS IN PRODUCTION THAT REALLY MATTERS- I URGE YOU TO PASSED SB TWO FIFTY FIVE TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS LIKE ME.

WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. C. NINE I JUST IT JUST A COMMENT- FROM MY END I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME QUESTIONS RAISED AS TO WHY WE'RE REQUESTING TO. SUNSET ON SB SEVEN EIGHTEEN BY SENATOR BATES WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY AND NOT FOR THIS BILL- AND IT IS REALLY A DIFFERENCES IN THE ASSOCIATION'S WHILE BOTH BILLS ARE SETTING FORTH ESSENTIALLY THE SAME GUARD RAILS. AND PROCESSES THE EMPLOYEE STATUS OF EACH OF THE ASSOCIATION'S APPEAR TO BE DIFFERENT. SB SEVEN EIGHTEEN COULD APPLIES NARROWLY TO BIO COMPANIES WHO CAN POTENTIALLY BY IN THE SMALL GROUP MARKET. BUT AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY THE AUTHOR AND WITNESSES TODAY- THIS BILL- APPLIES NEARLY TWO EMPLOYEES WHO. ARE FREELANCE EMPLOYEES WITH NO ABILITY TO QUALIFY FOR THEIR EMPLOYER'S GROUP HEALTH PLANS- WHETHER SMALL OR LARGE GROUP. THE PROJECT BY PROJECT FREELANCE NATURE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT PATTERNS INHERENT IN THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION INDUSTRY SO THAT IS WHY WE'RE DOING THIS DIFFERENTLY AND SO AND THROUGH THIS BILL- THE BILL HAS A MOTION BY. MISTER NAZARIAN A SECOND BY MISS AGUIAR-CURRY AND ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY. COGENT EXPLANATION OF THE DIFFERENCES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAGA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE BILL DOES THE MOTION IS DO YOU PASS. TO APPROPRIATIONS.

THAT ARE PREVENTING FAMILIES FROM EXACT ACCESSING BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WITH AUTISM WHO RECEIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT EARLY CAN SHOW REMARKABLE PROGRESS THIS BILL CODIFIES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFIED AUTISM SERVICE PROFESSIONAL AND PARA PROFESSIONAL TO ENSURE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE STATISTICS TELL US THAT ONE IN FIFTY NINE CHILDREN BORN TODAY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY TO HELPING THESE CHILDREN LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL AND HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS CRITICAL. NOT ALL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM ARE THE SAME THEY RESPOND TO TREATMENT DIFFERENTLY CHILDREN NEED TREATMENT TAILORED TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN OR PSYCHOLOGIST WHO KNOWS THEM BEST NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TREATMENT THAT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY CHILD TEN YEARS AGO SB NINE FORTY SIX PASSED THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS BUT OTHERS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FOR RECEIVING ITS BENEFITS BECAUSE OF A DRAFTING ERROR AN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS NOT EVERY CHILD RECEIVING COVERAGE FOR THE TREATMENTS. AT BY THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER- PRESCRIBED FOR THEM THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING DENIED THAT COVERAGE ADDITIONALLY FOR MANY CHILDREN THERE IS A SIX TO TWELVE MONTH WAITING LIST FOR THE ONE TREATMENT THAT HEALTH INSURANCE WILL COVER TREATMENT THE LATEST TREATMENT TONIGHT IN A DEVELOPING MIND BY EXPANDING THE TIMES OF QUALIFIED BY EXPANDING THE TYPES OF QUALIFIED ALREADY STATE CERTIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE. THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THE CRITICAL SHORTAGE AND ALLOW FOR. TO RECEIVE THE TREATMENT THEIR PHYSICIAN HAS PRESCRIBED. THE BILL ALSO ADDRESSES ROADBLOCKS THE COVERAGE FOR PARENTS. WHO FOR REASONS OF WORKER FAMILY PRESSURE CANNOT FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR CHILDREN'S THERAPY SESSION. THE SESSION THE SITUATION SHOULDN'T PRECLUDE COVERAGE OF A MEDICALLY NECESSARY. TREATMENT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I HAVE JIM LANTRY. FROM THE D. I. R. FOR TIME COALITION AND ALISON FEIGN A PARENT. OF A CHILD WITH AUTISM TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR- MADAM OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR OUR TWO WITNESSES PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. KEEP UP FIND THEIR OPEN. PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD COMMITTEE MEMBERS JIM LANDRY WITH THE D. I. R. FLOOR TIME COALITION IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW FOR MANY OF US WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE SO THIS WILL SOUND FAMILIAR. ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM DESERVE THE BEST DOCTOR PSYCHOLOGIST PRESCRIBED MEDICALLY NECESSARY EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THEM RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE TREATMENT EARLY RESPOND BETTER AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THE TREATMENT TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD IS IMPORTANT AND RESULTS IN THE CHILD ATTAINING HIS OR HER POTENTIAL. NO TWO CHILDREN ARE ALIKE NO TWO CHILDREN WITH ACTED MORE LIKE RATHER WHAT WORKS FOR ONE CHILD MAY ACTUALLY BE HARMFUL FOR ANOTHER UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW TREATMENT SHOULD BE AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE WHICH REQUIRES THREE THINGS. BIRDS THE TREATMENT HAS TO BE SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH SECOND IT MUST USE THE CLINICIANS BEST JUDGMENT AND THIRD IT MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE PATIENT A TREATMENT OUR IDEA OF SYSTEM THAT ONLY ALLOWS FOR ONE TREATMENT CAN'T POSSIBLY MEET THOSE THREE CRITERIA. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CAST MENTAL HEALTH PARITY LAW IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE IT ANTICIPATED THAT AUTISM WOULD BE TREATED THE SAME MATTERS PHYSICAL AILMENTS UNFORTUNATELY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SENATE BILL NINE FORTY SIX WHICH MANDATED THAT ALL PRESCRIBE MEDICALLY NECESSARY EVIDENCE BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT TO BE COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE AGAIN. UNFORTUNATELY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN WHAT DID HAPPEN IS THAT HEALTH INSURANCE WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS COVERED ONLY ONE FORM OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS OTHER FORMS OF EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT WERE DENIED COVERAGE AS A RESULT PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM PRESCRIBE A DIFFERENT FORM OF TREATMENT WERE FACED WITH THREE OPTIONS. FIRST PUT THE PAPER THE PRESCRIBE TREATMENT OUT OF POCKET EVEN THOUGH THEIR THEIR EMPLOYERS THAT ALREADY PAY FOR COVERAGE AND FOR MOST PARENTS PARTICULARLY SINGLE PARENTS LOW INCOME PARENTS THIS OPTION WAS ON AFFORDABLE. THE SECOND WAS THIS REGIONAL CENTERS TO PAY FOR THE TREATMENT IN SOME CASES OCCURRED CONTRARY TO THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT. OF SENATE BILL NINE FORTY SIX. THE THIRD OPTION WAS TO SEND ACCEPT THE ONE FORM OF. THAT WAS COVERED HE THOUGH NINETY MIGHT NOT BE A- OR MIGHT BE BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE CHILD. IT ALSO RESULTED IN THE LONGER TERM CARE COSTS IN HEALTH INSURANCE KERRIER MORE MONEY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY CUSSING THE CHILD TIME THAT CAN NEVER BE RECOVERED. THIS BILL WILL RECTIFY THAT AND FINALLY ACHIEVED THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY BILL AND SENATE BILL NINE FORTY SIX. THE BILL COMPLEMENTS LAST YEAR'S SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE WHICH AMENDED MENTAL HEALTH PARITY BILL. UNDER SB FIVE SIXTY TWO QUALIFIED UNSUPERVISED PROFESSIONALS WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE COVER TREATMENT AND ALLOW MORE CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THIS ESSENTIAL TREATMENT. SB FIVE SIXTY TWO ALSO INCREASE OF THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR PARA PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING NINE ABA SERVICES. AND ALSO REQUIRES BACKGROUND CHECKS AND CLOSE OTHER LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE ALLOWED INSURANCE CARRIERS TO DENY COVERAGE. THE BILL ASSORTED AS SUPPORTED BY DOZENS OF ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE AUTISM SOCIETY IN DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS OVER FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS. PARTICULARLY PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHO NEED THESE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS. THE BILL ENJOYED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN EACH SENATE VOTE. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL. GO AHEAD MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT WITNESS. HI ALISON.
