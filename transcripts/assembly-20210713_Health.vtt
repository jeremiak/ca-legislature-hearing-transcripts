THINK. IT IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:05.387
TO COLLECT DATA. BUT I ALSO DO

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:05.988
TO MAKE A POINT THAT. WE DO

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:08.123
WENT THROUGH A- SOCIAL IT WAS

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.025
AN EXPERIMENT IT WAS REALITY.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.860
AND WE JUST. WEWERE IN A

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:14.096
POSITION WHERE WE COLLECTED

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:17.299
REAL TIME DATA. BASED ON THAT

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:18.567
COULD YOU TELL US WHAT THEY

01:17:18.633 --> 01:17:20.602
NEED FOR THIS BILL WOULD BE

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.571
BECAUSE FROM THIS POINT FORWARD

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:23.705
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:24.606
COLLECTING DATA THAT'S

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:26.975
WONDERFUL. AND WE NEED THAT BUT

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.977
WHEN WE JUST WENT THROUGH A

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:31.113
REAL TIME CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:33.315
HAD A YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS TO

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:35.951
COLLECT DATA WHAT IS DATA DATA

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:42.491
SUGGESTING TO US. I'D SAY FOR

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:43.492
THE IN A WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:45.227
FROM THAT IS THAT THERE ARE

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:48.463
SOME HOSPITALS THAT WERE NOT-

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:49.965
IN A SITUATION OF A STAFFING

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:52.067
SHORTAGE. BUT WERE ATTEMPTING

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:53.802
TO PREVENT THE CDPH FROM THE

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:55.837
ADMINISTRATION BUT THERE WAS A

01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:57.672
STAFFING SHORTAGE OF SOME KIND

01:17:57.739 --> 01:18:00.108
AND WE FOUND THAT OUT BECAUSE-

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:01.376
YOU KNOW HOSPITALS RETURNING TO

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:03.678
THE FACILITY. AND TURNING I'M

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:06.314
SORRY TO THE STATE AND SAYINGYOU KNOW HEY WE DON'T HAVE AN

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:08.083
ACCOUNT WITH THEM ONE IT'S

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:09.551
COMING BACK FROM THE GROUND IN

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.586
THE ACTUAL REPORTING IS THERE'S

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:13.288
MAFFIA POLICE HAVE STAFF NURSES

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.657
THAT NORMALLY WORKS. THREE FOUR

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:16.525
FIVE IF THE WEEK ARE ALL OF A

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:18.760
SUDDEN ONLY WORKING ONE SHIFT A

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:20.095
WEEK SO THAT PROBABILITY

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:23.198
ACTUALLY. IN A STAFFING CRISIS

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:25.333
WHERE THEY NEED TO BE GIVEN THE

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.401
FREEDOM TO NOT FALL OWNER

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:28.103
SUFFICIENT REFILLS WHICH OFTEN

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.472
PUTS THE PATIENT IN DANGER OR

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:31.640
IS THAT FACILITY MANUFACTURING

01:18:31.706 --> 01:18:33.375

SPECULATION THAN IT WAS BASED

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:46.988
ON DATA SO I WOULD HAVE HOPE

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:48.090
THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:50.358

01:51:09.696 --> 01:51:12.098
BILL- AND I THINK THEY'RE

01:51:12.165 --> 01:51:12.799
HUNGRY FOR MORE OF THESE

01:51:12.866 --> 01:51:14.934
RESOURCES. ALSO YOU LOOK AT

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:16.503
THESE THE PSYCHEDELICS THESE

01:51:16.569 --> 01:51:18.438
ARE NOT ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES.

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:19.806
YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK YOU DO

01:51:19.873 --> 01:51:21.007
HAVE TO WEIGH AT WHICH WE DO

01:51:21.074 --> 01:51:22.342

OUTWEIGH THE BAD. AND TO MEET

01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:26.112
THE EVIDENCE IS VERY CLEAR IN

01:51:26.179 --> 01:51:27.847
THIS CASE OF THIS BILL. THAT

01:51:27.914 --> 01:51:29.849
THE GOOD OUTWEIGHS THE BAD. AND

01:51:29.916 --> 01:51:31.484
THAT DECRIMINALIZING WE'RE JUST

01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:33.753
TALKING ABOUT SMALL AMOUNTS FOR

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.655
PERSONAL USE ONLY. IS ONE WAY

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:37.057
THAT I THINK WE CAN NARROWLY

01:51:37.123 --> 01:51:38.558
GIVE MORE RESOURCES TO PEOPLE

01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:41.227
WHO NEED IT. AND IT DEFINITELY

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:42.395
YOU KNOW THESE TYPES OF

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:43.663
PSYCHEDELICS HELP GET PEOPLE

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:45.465
OFF OF HEAVIER DRUGS AND HARDER

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:47.267
DRUGS DRUGS LIKE HEROIN. WHICH

01:51:47.333 --> 01:51:48.168
WE KNOW WILL HAVE A VERY

01:51:48.234 --> 01:51:49.636
DETRIMENTAL EFFECT TO OUR

01:51:49.702 --> 01:51:51.337
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE BOARD

01:51:51.404 --> 01:51:53.640
RURAL URBAN SUBURBAN. AND IF WE

REALLY APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:25.105
I UNDERSTAND THAT SO MUCH OF

01:52:25.171 --> 01:52:26.406
PUBLIC POLICY IS WEIGHING THESE

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:27.907
CONSIDERATIONS AND I REALLY

01:52:27.974 --> 01:52:29.109
APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION THAT'S

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:30.877
BEEN PAID TO THESE QUESTIONS. I

01:52:30.944 --> 01:52:31.678
THINK THE CORE THING TO

01:52:31.744 --> 01:52:33.046
UNDERSTAND IS THAT A LOT OF

01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:34.114
THESE BEHAVIORS ARE ALREADY

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.849
OCCURRING A LOT OF THE HARMS

01:52:35.915 --> 01:52:36.983
THAT OCCUR FROM PSYCHEDELICS

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:38.518
OCCUR BECAUSE OF AN INTEGRATED

01:52:38.585 --> 01:52:39.619
USE OR THESE THINGS THAT ARE

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:41.621
RELATED TO. STIGMA TRAUMA IN

01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:43.690
DESPERATION A LOT OF THE SOCIAL

01:52:43.756 --> 01:52:45.158
HARMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG USE

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:46.259
IN GENERAL AND PSYCHEDELICS IN

01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:47.627
PARTICULAR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:49.462
DESPERATION. I THINK FOR PEOPLE

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:50.163
WHETHER THEY'RE VETERANS ARE

01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:51.164
OTHERS THE FEAR OF

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:52.265
CRIMINALIZATION AND THE FEAR OF

01:52:52.332 --> 01:52:54.067
ARREST IS ONE OF THE MOST

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:55.368
LIKELY DRIVERS FOR PEOPLE

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:56.569
ACTUALLY GOING INWARD INTO

01:52:56.636 --> 01:52:58.037
INTERNALIZING THAT STIGMA AND

01:52:58.104 --> 01:53:00.206
REFUSING TO. ASK FOR HELP SO

01:53:00.273 --> 01:53:01.307
PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR ARE

01:53:01.374 --> 01:53:02.475
ACTUALLY EXACERBATED BY THE

01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:03.776
FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE FEEL FREE

01:53:03.843 --> 01:53:06.012
TO STICK OF CRIMINALIZATION. I

01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:06.946
BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW

01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:08.481
MORE ROOM FOR THAT- HONEST

01:53:08.548 --> 01:53:12.252
EDUCATION TO OCCUR IF THAT FEAR

01:53:12.318 --> 01:53:14.154
OF ARREST WERE NOT ON THE TABLE.

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.522
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH-

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:17.524

YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT IF

01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:24.531
YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE. AND

01:53:24.597 --> 01:53:25.298
THAT IS A CHALLENGE WITH OUR

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:28.401
PROCESS BECAUSE. ONCE YOU'RE

01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:34.707
GONE YOU'RE GONE SO- OKAY AND

01:53:34.774 --> 01:53:35.942
MAYBE IF I CAN'T ANOTHER

01:53:36.009 --> 01:53:37.877
ANOTHER QUESTION AND AGAIN THIS

01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:41.047
IS PART OF THE- ABA A WITH-

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:44.017
WITH THIS- IN REGARDS TO THE

01:53:44.083 --> 01:53:45.251
THAT I'VE HEARD FROM VETERANS-

01:53:45.318 --> 01:53:48.321
I'VE GOT THE AND TWENTY PALMS

01:53:48.388 --> 01:53:49.088
THEM IN COURT BY A GROUND

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:51.791
COMBAT CENTER- I AM SURROUNDED

01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:54.928
BY- SOME OF. THE MARINES- AND-

01:53:54.994 --> 01:53:58.698
AND RETIRED- MARINES- AND THOSE

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:00.667

THAT AFFECTS THEM AND WEN YOU

01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:08.441
WHEN YOU HEAR FROM THEM- LIKE

01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:09.776
LIKE I HAVE LIKE YOU YOU HAD

01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:12.745
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS- IT DOES

01:54:12.812 --> 01:54:16.049
WEIGH ON YOU AND I THINK- ABOUT

01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:18.618
ABOUT IT WHY CAN'T WE WHY I

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:20.386
CAN'T WE HAVE A SUPERVISED IN

01:54:20.453 --> 01:54:22.388
CALIFORNIA WHY CAN'T WE HAVE.

01:54:22.455 --> 01:54:24.724
UNSUPERVISED YOU KNOW FOR THOSE

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:25.658
INDIVIDUALS MEDICAL

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:27.927
PROFESSIONALS- THAT CAN- THEY

01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:30.463
CAN SUPERVISE THIS TYPE OF

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:32.832
CLINICAL A WORK WHAT WHAT IS IT

01:54:32.899 --> 01:54:33.733
WHAT WE HAVE TO JUST TO

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:39.138
DECRIMINALIZE- THAT THESE.

01:54:39.205 --> 01:54:40.106
THESE- THESE SUBSTANCES. QUITE

01:54:40.173 --> 01:54:40.673
FRANKLY WE CAN AND WE SHOULD

01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:42.242
RAISE I MEAN. BUT THE REALITY

01:54:42.308 --> 01:54:43.309
MATTERS WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:45.645
EVERY SINGLE DAY RIGHT NOW. OF

01:54:45.712 --> 01:54:49.882
HEROIN OVERDOSES OF SUICIDE. OF

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:50.984
DEPRESSION THAT'S IMPACTING

01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.418
THEM. AND IF WE CAN

01:54:52.485 --> 01:54:54.020
DECRIMINALIZE THIS PIECE OF IT

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:56.022
AND START THAT PROCESS AND

01:54:56.089 --> 01:54:58.124
CONTINUE TO WORK ON- MORE

01:54:58.191 --> 01:54:59.859
REGULATED SETTINGS. THAT'S

01:54:59.926 --> 01:55:00.727
EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:02.862
DOING- BUT THIS I THINK TAKING

01:55:02.929 --> 01:55:03.596
AWAY THE SORT OF

01:55:03.663 --> 01:55:05.965
CRIMINALIZATION OF SMALL

01:55:06.032 --> 01:55:07.367
AMOUNTS OF POSSESSION I ALSO

01:55:07.433 --> 01:55:08.234
THINK WE'LL TAKE THIS OUT OF

01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:10.169
THE SHADOWS. AND INTO MORE OF

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:12.005
THE MAINSTREAM AND THEN WE CAN

01:55:12.071 --> 01:55:13.906
CONSIDER FURTHER ADDITIONAL-

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:15.975
REGULATORY LISTENING FOR THESE

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:20.813
TYPES OF A- PSYCHEDELICS OKAY

UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS WITH

01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:29.522
THIS BILL- BUT I AM GOING TO

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:30.323
DEVOTE TO MOVE IT OUT OF

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:31.624
COMMITTEE AND RETAIN THE RIGHT

01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:33.359
TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AGAINST IT

01:55:33.426 --> 01:55:33.960
WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR I'D

01:55:34.027 --> 01:55:35.662
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME

01:55:35.728 --> 01:55:37.530
MORE. QUESTIONS ANSWERED SHE-

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. MISTER

ACTUALLY SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY

01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:08.261
ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:56:08.328 --> 01:56:10.596
TURMOIL YOU EXPRESSED BECAUSE

01:56:10.663 --> 01:56:11.931
THAT'S EXACTLY THE INTERNAL

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:14.901
TURMOIL I HAVE YET I REPRESENT

01:56:14.967 --> 01:56:19.972
A RELATIVELY- BLUER DISTRICT

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:22.442
AND I THINK I HAVE CONSTITUENTS

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:23.976
WHO WOULD VERY MUCH WANT TO SEE

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:26.412
ME SUPPORT THIS. BUT FOR ME

01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:28.247
THIS IS ALSO BEYOND DEMOCRATIC

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:29.716
OR REPUBLICAN OR ANY PARTISAN

01:56:29.782 --> 01:56:31.684
LINE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:32.819
LOOK AT THE DATA AND YOU TRY

01:56:32.885 --> 01:56:34.320
TO. BEST COME UP WITH A

01:56:34.387 --> 01:56:36.222
SOLUTION THAT MAKES SENSE AND I

01:56:36.289 --> 01:56:38.791
GOTTA SAY IT'S- SOMEWHAT

01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:40.093
FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THERE'S

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:41.828
ALWAYS A LACK OF THE SPECIFIC

01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:43.930
DATA YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK FOR.

01:56:43.996 --> 01:56:45.798
YET AT THE SAME TIME A LOT OF

01:56:45.865 --> 01:56:47.834
THIS FEAR THAT IS PLACED THAN

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:50.536
US. WHEN YOU. SCRATCH THE

01:56:50.603 --> 01:56:51.971
SURFACE AND WHEN YOU LOOK INTO

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:53.973
A DEEPER YOU SEE THAT IT REALLY

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.442
ISN'T BASED ON A GREAT DEAL OF

01:56:56.509 --> 01:56:58.745
EVIDENCE IT'S ON ITS OWN. JUST

01:56:58.811 --> 01:57:00.747
YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS AGO WE KEPT

01:57:00.813 --> 01:57:02.548
ON HEARING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:57:02.615 --> 01:57:04.517
DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT

01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:06.252
YOU KNOW DECRIMINALIZING.

01:57:06.319 --> 01:57:07.987
MARIJUANA AND CANNABIS IS GOING

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:09.489
TO BE HORRIBLE FOR US I CAN'T

01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:11.357
THINK OF A SINGLE DEPARTMENT OR

01:57:11.424 --> 01:57:12.158
AGENCY THAT ACTUALLY WAS IN

01:57:12.225 --> 01:57:14.127
FAVOUR. WHAT'S SURPRISING TO ME

01:57:14.193 --> 01:57:17.029
IS. WE HAVE A BILL TODAY THAT

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:19.732
SEVERAL DIFFERENT POLICE.

01:57:19.799 --> 01:57:20.199
AGENCIES ARE ACTUALLY

01:57:20.266 --> 01:57:23.936
SUPPORTING- THE FEAR WITH

01:57:24.003 --> 01:57:26.773
MARIJUANA WAS. YUP PART ONE

01:57:26.839 --> 01:57:28.174
CRIMES ARE GONNA GO UP THERE'S

01:57:28.241 --> 01:57:29.475
GOING TO BE ROBBERY THERE'S

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:32.678
GOING TO BE. MANY DIFFERENT

01:57:32.745 --> 01:57:36.349
SMALL SMALLER RELATED THEFTS

01:57:36.416 --> 01:57:38.785
AND BURGLARIES AND ROBBERIES IT

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:40.686
ACTUALLY WENT ON THE DECLINE

01:57:40.753 --> 01:57:42.922
IT'S ONLY GONE UP RECENTLY IN

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:45.425
THIS LAST YEAR BUT WE KNOW THAT

01:57:45.491 --> 01:57:46.058
THAT INCREASE HAS NOTHING TO DO

01:57:46.125 --> 01:57:50.196
AS A DIRECT CORRELATION TO THE

01:57:50.263 --> 01:57:51.130
LEGALIZATION BACK IN TWO

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:52.899
THOUSAND SIXTEEN. YOU LOOK AT

01:57:52.965 --> 01:57:56.135
WHAT HAPPENED IN OREGON. EVEN

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:56.669
THOUGH IT JUST PASSED LAST

01:57:56.736 --> 01:57:58.504
NOVEMBER. AND IT'S BEEN

01:57:58.571 --> 01:58:01.541
IMPLEMENTED AS OF JANUARY THERE

01:58:01.607 --> 01:58:07.713
IS NO. NO CREDIBLE DEDUCTION

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:09.215
THAT THERE'S BEEN ANY INCREASE

01:58:09.282 --> 01:58:12.985
IN- ROBBERIES OR ANYTHING

01:58:13.052 --> 01:58:16.088
RELATED TO BECAUSE AS A SUBSET

01:58:16.155 --> 01:58:18.424
DO TO OTHERS I'M SORRY AS A

01:58:18.491 --> 01:58:20.860
SUBSET OF CRIME ACTIVITY DUE

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:23.596
TO. THE LEGALIZATION OF THESE

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:26.866
DRUGS AND AGAIN IT'S ONLY FOR A

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:28.234
PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS SO MAYBE A

01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:29.635
LITTLE OVER SIX MONTHS BUT

01:58:29.702 --> 01:58:31.737
AGAIN THERE IS NO CREDIBLE DATA

01:58:31.804 --> 01:58:36.442
THAT SUGGESTING IT. SO I KIND.

01:58:36.509 --> 01:58:38.010
IT'S DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME SOME

01:58:38.077 --> 01:58:39.345
OF THE INNER VOICES OF WANTING

01:58:39.412 --> 01:58:42.114
TO BE SAFE. AND WANTING TO TAKE

01:58:42.181 --> 01:58:44.717
THE SAFE ROUTE IN THIS ISSUE IN

01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:47.386
THIS INSTANCE. I NEVER HAD AN

01:58:47.453 --> 01:58:49.555
ISSUE SUPPORTING

01:58:49.622 --> 01:58:50.790
DECRIMINALIZING CANNABIS

01:58:50.857 --> 01:58:53.159
BECAUSE- LET'S FACE IT PEOPLE

01:58:53.226 --> 01:58:54.260
WHO USE CANNABIS ARE NEVER

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:55.228
GOING TO WANT TO GET OFF THE

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:57.530
COUCH. SO IT'S NOT GOING TO

01:58:57.597 --> 01:59:01.334
CREATE A PROBLEM. BUT- I DO

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:02.935
APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:05.538
THE COMMITTEE HAS. WORKED OUT

01:59:05.605 --> 01:59:08.441
WITH THE AUTHOR- FROM WHAT I

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:10.843
UNDERSTAND IF THIS WAS ONLY TO

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:12.879
BE INTRODUCED AS A METAPHOR

01:59:12.945 --> 01:59:15.681
MEDICINAL PURPOSES- THERE WAS

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.149
GETTING OUT THE OPPOSITION FROM

01:59:17.216 --> 01:59:19.418
THE HEALTHCARE. ARENA OR THE

01:59:19.485 --> 01:59:21.120
DOCTORS AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I

01:59:21.187 --> 01:59:24.724
UNDERSTAND. THAT'S WHY. THIS

01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:26.626
MEASURE WAS INTRODUCED IN A WAY

01:59:26.692 --> 01:59:28.861
WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO PROVIDE

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:31.931
MICRO DOSES. SO THAT ITS

01:59:31.998 --> 01:59:34.066
PURPOSE IS SOLELY FOR MEDICAL

01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:36.569
PURPOSES FOR TO ALLOWING

01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:38.070
INDIVIDUALS WITH DEPRESSION OR

01:59:38.137 --> 01:59:40.273
OTHER ELEMENTS TO BE ABLE TO

01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:43.409
FIND RELIEF SO I'M INCLINED TO

01:59:43.476 --> 01:59:48.214
SUPPORT IT. VERY- HESITANTLY

01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:52.919
AND THE- I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL

01:59:52.985 --> 01:59:55.288
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL.

01:59:55.354 --> 01:59:56.989
ONCE IT COMES ON THE FLOOR BUT

01:59:57.056 --> 01:59:58.991
I DO WANNA I DO WANT THIS

01:59:59.058 --> 02:00:00.426
CONVERSATION TO GO FORWARD

02:00:00.493 --> 02:00:02.295
BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO BE.

02:00:02.361 --> 02:00:04.130
THINKING ABOUT THIS IN A WAY OF

02:00:04.196 --> 02:00:05.565
HOW DO WE STOP JUST

02:00:05.631 --> 02:00:07.466
CRIMINALIZING THINGS BUT

02:00:07.533 --> 02:00:10.703
LOOKING AT TRYING TO. USE IT AS

02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:12.905
AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX AILMENTS-

02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:14.373
SO WITH THAT THANKS TO THE

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.576

WORKING ON THIS- AND- I WILL BE

MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

JUST BRIEFLY I SUPPORT THIS

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:33.893
BILL WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT HI I

02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.962
THOUGHT WHAT ON EARTH AND WE

02:00:36.028 --> 02:00:38.965
PROPOSING HERE. LEGALIZING IT

02:00:39.031 --> 02:00:41.000
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BUY IT IN

02:00:41.067 --> 02:00:41.634
GETTING THE HIT GETTING IN THE

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:44.437
HANDS OF. OUR YOUTH AND YOU

02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:46.138
KNOW A MILLION TALK ABOUT MY

02:00:46.205 --> 02:00:50.042
YOUTH BUT- IT WAS TO SAY THAT I

02:00:50.109 --> 02:00:51.611
THINK THAT HAVING THIS PRODUCT-

02:00:51.677 --> 02:00:52.945
READILY AVAILABLE TO OUR YOUTH

02:00:53.012 --> 02:00:54.880
IS NOT A POSITIVE THING BUT WE

02:00:54.947 --> 02:00:56.415
ARE DECRIMINALIZING POSSESSION

02:00:56.482 --> 02:00:57.850
BUT I CONCUR WITH MR MAYS I

02:00:57.917 --> 02:01:00.286
THINK THE REAL ISSUE. IS THAT

02:01:00.353 --> 02:01:02.421
IF THIS HAS A VIABLE PURPOSE I

02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:03.389
COULD HEAR FROM SOME THE

02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:05.958
WITNESSES. IT SHOULD BE-

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:07.393
SANCTION FOR THE SALE YOU

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.494
SHOULD WE SHOULD DO IT LIKE WE

02:01:08.561 --> 02:01:09.862
DID WITH MEDICINAL MARIJUANA

02:01:09.929 --> 02:01:12.031
FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS AND-

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:13.966
GO GET A DOCTOR'S NOTE. AND

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:14.533
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:15.568
INSTANCES WHERE IS THIS IS

02:01:15.635 --> 02:01:17.203
SHOWN THERE HAS SOME VALUE SO I

02:01:17.269 --> 02:01:18.604
THINK THIS IS LITERALLY THE

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:20.072
WRONG ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:01:20.139 --> 02:01:23.009
IN THE LAST I GET THAT THE-

02:01:23.075 --> 02:01:23.876
AUTHOR WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:25.344
CRIMINALIZATION AND THE IMPACT

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:26.746
THE SOME PEOPLE. COULD BE

02:01:26.812 --> 02:01:28.381
CHARGED TODAY WITH POSSESSION

02:01:28.447 --> 02:01:30.516
BUT THE REAL ISSUE OF THIS DOES

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:32.218
HAS A SOCIETAL BENEFITS. WE

02:01:32.284 --> 02:01:33.586

MEMBER FOR PRESENTING ON A BILL

02:01:50.903 --> 02:01:53.873
I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR BILL AND-

02:01:53.939 --> 02:01:55.441
I WISH THE SENATOR WAS HERE HAD

02:01:55.508 --> 02:01:57.243
A CONVERSATION WITH HIM. A

02:01:57.309 --> 02:01:58.511
COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT THIS

02:01:58.577 --> 02:02:02.648
BILL- YOU KNOW I E. I'M VERY

02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:05.651
CONFLICTED. I GENERALLY FALL IN

02:02:05.718 --> 02:02:07.119
THE CATEGORY OF WANTING TO DO

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:09.488
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO. PUSH

02:02:09.555 --> 02:02:11.924
FORWARD LEGISLATION THAT

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:13.025
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM

02:02:13.092 --> 02:02:15.561
ORIENTED THAT'S ABOUT REDUCING

02:02:15.628 --> 02:02:18.464
CAR SERRATION. THAT'S ABOUT

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:20.366
HELPING PEOPLE AT THE END OF

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:22.568
THE DAY RESTART THEIR LIVES. I

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:24.603
DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO SEE.

02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:26.939
MORE DRUGS IN MY COMMUNITY. WE

02:02:27.006 --> 02:02:29.475
ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH HUGE

02:02:29.542 --> 02:02:30.843
ISSUES RELATED TO HOUSING AND

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:33.846
HOMELESSNESS- SUBSTANCE ABUSE

02:02:33.913 --> 02:02:37.883
PROBLEMS. AT THE- ABILITY FOR

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:39.752
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO

02:02:39.819 --> 02:02:42.088
DO SOMETHING IN MANY CASES FOR

02:02:42.154 --> 02:02:43.656
FOLKS TO HAVE ADDITIONAL

02:02:43.723 --> 02:02:45.725
SUPPORT WITH SOCIAL WORKERS

02:02:45.791 --> 02:02:51.297
WITH MENTAL HEALTH- EVALUATIONS

02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:52.298

02:02:52.364 --> 02:02:55.601
THE DAY. HELP PEOPLE. MY

02:02:55.668 --> 02:02:58.270
QUESTIONS ARE STILL UNANSWERED

02:02:58.337 --> 02:03:02.875
IN TERMS OF. THE ACT OF BUYING

02:03:02.942 --> 02:03:05.978
AND SELLING IT'S STILL ILLEGAL.

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:08.380
SO THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE ON HERE

02:03:08.447 --> 02:03:09.315
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:11.083
ALLOWABLE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY LOOK

02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:13.452
LIKE- I WOULD NEED TO SEE THEM

02:03:13.519 --> 02:03:15.354
AND I SEE THE THERE ARE GROUNDS

02:03:15.421 --> 02:03:21.060
AND- FOR L. IS D. FOUR DMT.

02:03:21.127 --> 02:03:24.029
FOR- MOLLY ECSTASY MDMA SAYS

02:03:24.096 --> 02:03:24.697
THE M. T. I DON'T EVEN KNOW

02:03:24.764 --> 02:03:26.132
WHAT SOME OF THIS STUFF IS

02:03:26.198 --> 02:03:29.268
CERTAIN MUSHROOMS I FEEL VERY I

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:31.737
FEEL REALLY- APPREHENSIVE OF

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:32.671
PUSHING A PIECE OF LEGISLATION

02:03:32.738 --> 02:03:37.042
FORWARD THAT- DOESN'T HAVE A

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:40.346
PLAN IN TERMS OF THE ACT OF THE

02:03:40.412 --> 02:03:40.880
SALE AND BUYING THE STILL

02:03:40.946 --> 02:03:43.516
ILLEGAL. AND SO YOUR STATE YOU

02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:46.252
ARE IN MANY WAYS PROMOTING AN

02:03:46.318 --> 02:03:48.521
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY OF DRUGS.

02:03:48.587 --> 02:03:49.088
I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT IN MY

02:03:49.155 --> 02:03:53.025
COMMUNITY- I WANT TO BE

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:54.193
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL I

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.795
UNDERSTAND AND THANKFUL TO THE

02:03:55.861 --> 02:03:57.730
TESTIMONY EARLIER FROM THE

02:03:57.797 --> 02:04:00.132
VETERANS WHO ARE TRYING TO FIND

02:04:00.199 --> 02:04:02.101
DIFFERENT WAYS TO ADDRESS

02:04:02.168 --> 02:04:04.770
ISSUES OF PTSD THAT PROBLEM IN

02:04:04.837 --> 02:04:07.640
ITSELF IS THAT THE TUITION IS

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:08.607
ONE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

02:04:08.674 --> 02:04:10.309
PROBLEM ONE THAT WE SHOULD

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:14.914
INVEST IN ONE THE SHOULD HAVE-

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:15.915
PERFECT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

02:04:15.981 --> 02:04:17.783

02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:19.718
EVALUATE AND HELP VETERANS THAT

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:22.488
NEED THOSE SERVICES. BUT IF

02:04:22.555 --> 02:04:23.722
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT RIGHT

02:04:23.789 --> 02:04:26.792
NOW. THE BILL DOESN'T REALLY

02:04:26.859 --> 02:04:29.061
HAVE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A

02:04:29.128 --> 02:04:32.064
CLINICAL SETTING. AND THAT YOU

02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:34.466
ARE ADVOCATING TO HELP THESE

02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:35.301
DRUGS TO SIMPLY BE ON THE

02:04:35.367 --> 02:04:37.303
STREET. I'M SORRY I JUST I

02:04:37.369 --> 02:04:39.738
CAN'T SUPPORT THAT AND I WANT

02:04:39.805 --> 02:04:41.707
TO FIND A PATHWAY THERE-

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:43.342
ANOTHER COLLEAGUE MENTIONED

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:45.411
MEDICINAL MARIJUANA MEDICINAL.

02:04:45.477 --> 02:04:47.246
TOOK TWENTY YEARS TO GET TO

02:04:47.313 --> 02:04:49.114
THAT LEVEL AND SURE WE WANT TO

02:04:49.181 --> 02:04:50.216
EXPEDITE THINGS AND MAKE SURE

02:04:50.282 --> 02:04:51.951
THAT THINGS MOVE FASTER BUT

02:04:52.017 --> 02:04:53.419
THERE WAS A CARD ASSOCIATED

02:04:53.485 --> 02:04:54.687
THERE WAS A DOCTOR ASSOCIATED

02:04:54.753 --> 02:04:57.289
THERE IS AN INCREASE OF USAGE

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:59.325
TO NOW THAT ITS RECREATIONAL

02:04:59.391 --> 02:05:01.060
AND IT'S MORE ACCEPTABLE. BUT

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:02.828
IT WASN'T JUST LET'S. LEGALIZE

02:05:02.895 --> 02:05:04.663
AND THAT FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:05:04.730 --> 02:05:05.197
HAPPENS IT WAS THERE WAS A

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:07.800
PROCESS. AND I'M TRYING TO

02:05:07.867 --> 02:05:08.400
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROCESS IS

02:05:08.467 --> 02:05:11.937
HERE. I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN.

02:05:12.004 --> 02:05:13.973

02:05:14.039 --> 02:05:15.574
BILL JUST ISN'T REALLY FULLY

02:05:15.641 --> 02:05:17.877
THERE YET THE INTENT IS GOOD.

02:05:17.943 --> 02:05:18.944
BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE

02:05:19.011 --> 02:05:20.846
THAN NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WORK

02:05:20.913 --> 02:05:22.214
NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT

02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:24.149
THESE TYPES OF DRUGS. DON'T END

02:05:24.216 --> 02:05:25.284
UP IN THE WRONG HANDS AND

02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:26.619
ACTUALLY END UP HURTING PEOPLE

02:05:26.685 --> 02:05:29.121

AND YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:47.339
COMMUNITY- AND YOU CITED A

02:05:47.406 --> 02:05:49.808
COUPLE DIFFERENT- EXAMPLES HERE

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:50.709
YOU DON'T WANT MORE DRUGS IN

02:05:50.776 --> 02:05:52.411
YOUR COMMUNITY. I DON'T WANT

02:05:52.478 --> 02:05:53.145
MORE DRUGS IN MY COMMUNITY

02:05:53.212 --> 02:05:54.880
EITHER BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

02:05:54.947 --> 02:05:57.316
BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO'S DYING ON

02:05:57.383 --> 02:05:58.951
THE STREETS DOING HEROIN. AND A

02:05:59.018 --> 02:06:00.920
VETERAN WHO'S- SEEKING

02:06:00.986 --> 02:06:02.855
THERAPEUTIC RESOURCES TO DEAL

02:06:02.922 --> 02:06:04.990
WITH PTSD. SAYING THOSE ARE

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:07.259
VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. AND

02:06:07.326 --> 02:06:09.461
THESE TYPES OF A HOST ENGINES

02:06:09.528 --> 02:06:10.796
CAN ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE WHO

02:06:10.863 --> 02:06:12.031
ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL

02:06:12.097 --> 02:06:12.998
HEALTH CHALLENGES CAN HELP

02:06:13.065 --> 02:06:14.300
PEOPLE WHO ARE. DEALING WITH

02:06:14.366 --> 02:06:16.302
DRUG ADDICTION. YOU KNOW THE

02:06:16.368 --> 02:06:19.004
FDA IS CURRENTLY TRYING TO GO

02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:20.072
THROUGH A PROCESS OF LEGALIZING

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:22.141
THIS. IT COULD TAKE A NUMBER OF

02:06:22.207 --> 02:06:24.310
YEARS. A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IN

02:06:24.376 --> 02:06:26.011
THE MEANTIME WE SEE WHAT'S

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:27.813
HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:29.615
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PEOPLE.

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:30.349
BEGGING FOR THIS TO BE A

02:06:30.416 --> 02:06:32.351
RESOURCE. AND I DON'T WANT TO

02:06:32.418 --> 02:06:33.419
GET IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE

02:06:33.485 --> 02:06:34.687
BEGGING FOR ADDITIONAL

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:35.988
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DEAL

02:06:36.055 --> 02:06:38.590
WITH. THE ISSUES THAT THEY ARE

02:06:38.657 --> 02:06:39.158
CONFRONTED WITH EVERY SINGLE

02:06:39.224 --> 02:06:40.826
DAY AND NIGHT. AND SO IF WE CAN

02:06:40.893 --> 02:06:43.095
PROVIDE THAT PATH WHEN WE TALK

02:06:43.162 --> 02:06:45.431
ABOUT LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS.

02:06:45.497 --> 02:06:46.565
THERE WAS AN UNDERGROUND MARKET

02:06:46.632 --> 02:06:47.933
FOR VERY LONG TIME THERE'S

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.935
STILL AN UNDERGROUND MARCH. YOU

02:06:50.002 --> 02:06:51.603
KNOW AND IT WAS ONLY ONCE WE

02:06:51.670 --> 02:06:53.238
HAVE THE POLITICAL COURAGE TO

02:06:53.305 --> 02:06:55.040
SAY LOOK AT WHAT THE RESEARCH

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:58.377
IS TELLING US. ABOUT THIS. THAT

02:06:58.444 --> 02:07:00.112
WE WERE ABLE TO THEN SAY HERE'S

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:02.281
A PATH FOR LEGALIZATION RIGHT

02:07:02.348 --> 02:07:04.083
SO YES WE SHOULD HAVE CLINICAL

02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:06.585
STUDIES. MANY THERAPISTS OFFER

02:07:06.652 --> 02:07:08.654
THAT TYPE OF STUFF RIGHT YES

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:10.022
THE FDA SHOULD PURSUE

02:07:10.089 --> 02:07:11.824
LEGALIZATION AND THEY'RE DOING

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:12.858
THAT AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE A

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:14.193
NUMBER OF YEARS. BUT IN THE

02:07:14.259 --> 02:07:15.694
MEANTIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:17.162
SMALL AMOUNTS RIGHT FOR

02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:19.164
PERSONAL POSSESSION- YOU WOULD

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:20.099
MENTION THE SORT OF UNDERGROUND

02:07:20.165 --> 02:07:22.301
ECONOMY THAT YOU'VE CONCERNS

02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:23.369
ABOUT THAT'S HAPPENING TODAY.

02:07:23.435 --> 02:07:26.905
RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE CAN FIGURE

02:07:26.972 --> 02:07:28.307
OUT A WAY THAT FOR AGAIN FOR

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:29.408
THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES THE STUFF

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:31.410
CAN BE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THEN

02:07:31.477 --> 02:07:32.444
BY ALL MEANS I WANT TO GIVE

02:07:32.511 --> 02:07:33.712
PEOPLE THE TOOLS IN THEIR TOOL

02:07:33.779 --> 02:07:35.314
BOX THAT THEY HAVE AND YOU KNOW

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:36.248
GET I'M NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE

02:07:36.315 --> 02:07:37.583
BILL SO I DON'T HAVE ALL THE

02:07:37.649 --> 02:07:40.085
ANSWERS FOR YOU- BUT IT IS MY

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:42.121
HOPE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS

02:07:42.187 --> 02:07:44.523
PROCESS WE CAN CONTINUE TO-

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:45.324
DEFINED THIS BILL MORE

02:07:45.391 --> 02:07:47.526
SPECIFICALLY. I'D BE HAPPY AND

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:48.560
I'M SURE SENATOR WIENER WOULD

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:49.862
BE AS WELL TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU

02:07:49.928 --> 02:07:51.530
WITH MORE TO TIONAL CONCERNS

02:07:51.597 --> 02:07:53.565
TELL CRAFTED IN A WAY- BUT

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:55.334
AGAIN I THINK IT THE GOAL IS TO

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:56.201
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THESE

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:57.936
RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE I

02:07:58.003 --> 02:07:59.338
GUESS WHAT I'M I'M THANK YOU

02:07:59.405 --> 02:08:00.839
FOR THAT AND WHAT I'M STILL NOT

02:08:00.906 --> 02:08:02.474
HEARING IS THE HOW. IF YOU ARE

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:04.410
A VETERAN THAT NEED SERVICES.

02:08:04.476 --> 02:08:05.444
THAT WANTS TO TRY SOMETHING

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:07.479
DIFFERENT TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:10.516
PTSD WHAT IF THE HOUSE. I'D

02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:11.984
LOVE FOR MY WITNESS TO IF

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:14.319
THAT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIR PLEASE

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:16.321
GO AHEAD- TO HAVE A- OUR

02:08:16.388 --> 02:08:18.590
WITNESS SPEAK TO THAT. THE

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:21.794
SPANISH MAIL. GOOD AFTERNOON

02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:23.295
THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:08:23.362 --> 02:08:24.029
THIS CONVERSATION THESE

02:08:24.096 --> 02:08:26.865
QUESTIONS- ALSO A TWO THINGS

02:08:26.932 --> 02:08:27.633
ONE REGARDING THE COMMISSION OF

02:08:27.699 --> 02:08:29.935
THE BILL WHICH IS- IN THERE I

02:08:30.002 --> 02:08:32.404
BELIEVE TO THINK THROUGH A LOT

02:08:32.471 --> 02:08:33.972
OF THESE QUESTIONS REGARDING

02:08:34.039 --> 02:08:35.074
WHAT THAT MORE REGULATED

02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:37.643
STRUCTURE MIGHT LOOK LIKE- SO I

02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:38.477
DO THINK THAT SOME OF THOSE

02:08:38.544 --> 02:08:40.612
CONCERNS ARE RESPONDED TO BY AT

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:41.880
LEAST THE EXISTENCE OF THAT AND

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:42.915
AGAIN THE AMENDMENTS THAT CAME

02:08:42.981 --> 02:08:43.949
IN TODAY ALLOWED THAT TO BE A

02:08:44.016 --> 02:08:45.851
TIERED PIECE WHERE. THE FIRST

02:08:45.918 --> 02:08:47.753
ROUND OF IT IS MERELY EDUCATION

02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:49.421
AND HARM REDUCTION RESOURCES

02:08:49.488 --> 02:08:50.823
AND THEN THE SECOND BEING GOING

02:08:50.889 --> 02:08:51.990
TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE JUST

02:08:52.057 --> 02:08:54.059
ASK MORE AROUND REGULATED USE-

02:08:54.126 --> 02:08:56.395
OVERSIGHT AND SO ON- THE ANSWER

02:08:56.462 --> 02:08:57.262
TO THAT QUESTION IS THAT PEOPLE

02:08:57.329 --> 02:08:58.864
HAVE BEEN SELF ORGANIZING A LOT

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.265
OF THESE VETERANS GROUPS THAT

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:01.867
YOU'VE SEEN JOINT HAVE BEEN.

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:03.735
HOLDING CIRCLES ARE HOLDING

02:09:03.802 --> 02:09:04.870
COMMUNITY CEREMONIES AT

02:09:04.937 --> 02:09:07.139
THEMSELVES SO RIGHT NOW A LOT

02:09:07.206 --> 02:09:08.941
OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT'S BEING

02:09:09.007 --> 02:09:11.577
DEVELOPED AROUND SHARED USE AND

02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:13.345
IT FACILITATED USE EITHER COMES

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:15.214
FROM TRADITIONS THAT ARE COMING

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.448
OUT OF AS JUST MENTIONED

02:09:16.515 --> 02:09:18.517
EARLIER CENTRAL OR SOUTH

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:19.618
AMERICA. WHERE THESE.

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:20.586
SUBSTANCES HAVE BEEN USING

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:21.887
CEREMONIAL CONTEXT FOR A NUMBER

02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:22.788
OF YEARS AND PEOPLE HAVE

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:23.789
TRAINED AND TRAVELED AND

02:09:23.856 --> 02:09:26.291
TRAINED. TO DO THAT- OR IT

02:09:26.358 --> 02:09:27.793
RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:30.662
OF ISSUES REGARDING LICENSURE-

02:09:30.729 --> 02:09:32.030
AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY

02:09:32.097 --> 02:09:33.999
ANOTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THAT

02:09:34.066 --> 02:09:37.169
CONCERN FOR- CURRENTLY LICENSED

02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:38.370
FACILITATORS HAS BEEN VERY

02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:41.273
DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF FEAR. OF

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.374
LIABILITY AND OTHER RELATED

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:44.676
ISSUES SO THAT WAY IT'S BEEN

02:09:44.743 --> 02:09:45.577
HAPPENING IS THAT COMMUNITIES

02:09:45.644 --> 02:09:47.246
HAVE BEEN SELF ORGANIZING TO DO

02:09:47.312 --> 02:09:48.547
THESE CIRCLES. AND AS YOU'VE

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:50.082
HEARD THE HEALING IS ON GOING

02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:51.350
AND PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING

02:09:51.416 --> 02:09:52.518
THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:09:52.584 --> 02:09:53.585
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THE

02:09:53.652 --> 02:09:54.853
PEOPLE INCLUDING SOME THAT WE

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:56.155
SEE. ON THE STREET AS YOU

02:09:56.221 --> 02:09:57.089
MENTIONED YOU WERE DYING FROM

02:09:57.156 --> 02:09:58.924
HER AND ARE ALSO THOSE VETERANS

02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:00.592
WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM PTSD.

02:10:00.659 --> 02:10:01.760
THOSE ARE NOT NECESSARILY

02:10:01.827 --> 02:10:02.694
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND THERE

02:10:02.761 --> 02:10:06.665
IS A NEED THAT'S A VERY EXTREME

02:10:06.732 --> 02:10:07.299
THAT'S VERY THAT'S VERY VISIBLE

02:10:07.366 --> 02:10:09.635
THROUGHOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:11.336
THANK THANK YOU I DON'T I'M NOT

02:10:11.403 --> 02:10:12.471
SURE THAT THAT ACTUALLY ANSWERS

02:10:12.538 --> 02:10:15.140
MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS. HOW

02:10:15.207 --> 02:10:16.875
HOW ARE YOU GETTING THIS

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:18.610
POTENTIAL MEDICATION LET'S CALL

02:10:18.677 --> 02:10:20.512
IT MEDICATION FOR WHAT IT IS TO

02:10:20.579 --> 02:10:22.447
FOR ADDRESSING ISSUES. OF PTSD.

02:10:22.514 --> 02:10:24.049
WHAT IS THE HOW OUTSIDE OF

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:25.217
GOING TO SOUTH AMERICA AND

02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:27.553
PARTICIPATING IN A- OF AN

02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:29.188
INDIGENOUS CEREMONY AND RITUAL

02:10:29.254 --> 02:10:30.556
THAT TAKES YEARS AND DECADES

02:10:30.622 --> 02:10:32.491
FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND

02:10:32.558 --> 02:10:33.959
THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER DO ALONE.

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:36.094
WHAT IF THE HOW AND IF I AND I

02:10:36.161 --> 02:10:37.596
THINK SERVE A COMMUNITY OF

02:10:37.663 --> 02:10:38.297
VETERANS FROM IRAQ AND

02:10:38.363 --> 02:10:40.499
AFGHANISTAN. WHAT IS THE HOW

02:10:40.566 --> 02:10:42.568
OLD AND HOW AN INDIVIDUAL CAN

02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:44.570
GET A SEEK ASSISTANCE AND

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:46.071
ACTUALLY BUY THESE DRUGS WHAT

02:10:46.138 --> 02:10:47.973
DOES THAT PROCESS LOOK LIKE

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.908
ACCORDING TO THIS BILL. THIS

02:10:49.975 --> 02:10:51.543
BILL DOES NOT SPEAK DIRECTLY TO

02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:52.811
THE PURCHASE PROCESS THAT

02:10:52.878 --> 02:10:53.912
EXPLICITLY AVOIDS THAT

02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:54.980
CONVERSATION EIGHT EXPRESSLY

02:10:55.047 --> 02:10:57.115
AVOIDS CREATING AN- ECONOMY A

02:10:57.182 --> 02:10:58.684
MARKET OUT OF IT. WHICH IS I

02:10:58.750 --> 02:11:00.018
BELIEVE WHAT THE COMMISSION IS

02:11:00.085 --> 02:11:01.720
INTENDED TO DO SO RIGHT NOW THE

02:11:01.787 --> 02:11:03.722
PURCHASE EVERYTHING LEADING UP

02:11:03.789 --> 02:11:04.923
TO THE PERSONAL POSSESSION

02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:06.892
REMAINS ILLEGAL- WITH THIS

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:09.261
LEGISLATION. THANK YOU I

02:11:09.328 --> 02:11:11.029
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND

02:11:11.096 --> 02:11:12.097
I APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY I

02:11:12.164 --> 02:11:13.632
THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:15.667
SHARING RIGHT NOW IS THAT TRUTH

02:11:15.734 --> 02:11:17.402
THAT'S A VERY HARD FOR US TO

02:11:17.469 --> 02:11:19.104
MANAGE TO DEAL WITH I THINK. IF

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:20.973
THIS BILL WERE A BILL THAT SAID

02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:22.507
WE ARE CREATING A PLATFORM IN

02:11:22.574 --> 02:11:24.810
WHICH IN CERTAIN CLINICS OR

02:11:24.876 --> 02:11:27.746
SETTINGS OR- TRUSTED CENTERS

02:11:27.813 --> 02:11:29.481
WITH PROFESSIONALS. THAT THIS

02:11:29.548 --> 02:11:30.582
IS SOMETHING THAT CAN MOVE

02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:32.150
FORWARD I WOULD BE 1100% OKAY

02:11:32.217 --> 02:11:33.518
WITH THAT. BUT THE FACT THAT

02:11:33.585 --> 02:11:36.488
THE BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:38.557
CONTINUED ILLEGAL FAIL. I AM

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:40.225
ONLY ADDRESSES ISSUES OF

02:11:40.292 --> 02:11:41.593
QUANTITY AMOUNTS ARE ALLOWABLE

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:43.562
AMOUNTS THAT ARE CONTROLLED. A

02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:45.030
SUBSTANCE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO

02:11:45.097 --> 02:11:46.798
NOT BE ARRESTED COMPLETELY

02:11:46.865 --> 02:11:49.468
DIFFERENT THINGS- I THINK IT IS

02:11:49.534 --> 02:11:50.802
IT'S A STEP FORWARD IN AT LEAST

02:11:50.869 --> 02:11:53.739
THE CONVERSATION- I JUST I'M

02:11:53.805 --> 02:11:55.607
NOT SURE THAT JUST LEGALIZING

02:11:55.674 --> 02:11:57.909
WITHOUT A PATHWAY. ON HOW WE

02:11:57.976 --> 02:12:00.112
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT- IS THE

02:12:00.178 --> 02:12:02.247
RIGHT COURSE FOR RIGHT NOW. AND

02:12:02.314 --> 02:12:05.284
SO THAT'S- YOU KNOW I'M I'M

02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:06.652
SORRY TO SAY THAT THAT SOME.

02:12:06.718 --> 02:12:08.687
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I DO

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:09.855
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE WAYS

02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:11.923
THAT. AND THERE ARE NEW METHODS

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:13.558
THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED WHEN-

02:12:13.625 --> 02:12:15.060
RELATED TO ISSUES OF PTSD IN

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:17.162
VETERANS THAT I AM 1100% IN

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:19.331
SUPPORT AND WE HAVE SEEN THOSE

02:12:19.398 --> 02:12:19.865
STUDIES. BUT THIS DOESN'T

02:12:19.931 --> 02:12:21.466
ADDRESS THAT. THIS THIS

02:12:21.533 --> 02:12:24.970
ADDRESSES A PORTION THAT

02:12:25.037 --> 02:12:27.306
CONTINUES TO ALSO INDICATE THAT

02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:31.376
THE SALE AND BUYING OF. THESE

02:12:31.443 --> 02:12:33.078
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES IS

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:38.817
ACTUALLY STILL ILLEGAL. YEP

02:12:38.884 --> 02:12:40.552
I'LL LET YOU GO AHEAD THANKS.

02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:41.687
JUST ONE SUPER QUICK NO

02:12:41.753 --> 02:12:42.754
RESPONSE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

02:12:42.821 --> 02:12:45.190
THAT I'LL JUST NOTE THAT- WITH

02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:46.558
SOME OF THESE SUBSTANCES IN

02:12:46.625 --> 02:12:48.927
PARTICULAR THE PLANTS- I

02:12:48.994 --> 02:12:50.128
BELIEVE THAT HOME GROW IS ALSO

02:12:50.195 --> 02:12:51.563
PERMITTED SO THERE WOULD BE A

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:54.132
LEGAL WAY TO CULTIVATE PLANTS

02:12:54.199 --> 02:12:56.601
AND FUNGI- THAT ERROR INCLUDED

02:12:56.668 --> 02:12:57.235
THAT OUR NUMBER OF THE

02:12:57.302 --> 02:12:58.337
SUBSTANCES AND THIS BILL SO

02:12:58.403 --> 02:13:00.872
THAT IS ONE WAY IN THAT. SAFE

02:13:00.939 --> 02:13:03.642
NON SALE NINE- IT ECONOMIC

02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:05.177
ACCESS MIGHT BE AVAILABLE

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:08.313
THROUGH THE CULTIVATION OF SOME

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:09.381
OF THESE SUBSTANCES AND THAT'S

02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:11.717
WHERE I THINK SOME OF THOSE

02:13:11.783 --> 02:13:12.317
ANSWERS COULD OR SOME OF THOSE

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:12.918
QUESTIONS COULD BE ANSWERED.

02:13:12.984 --> 02:13:16.555
THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU

02:13:16.621 --> 02:13:19.591
I MISS BURKE. ASSEMBLY THIS

02:13:19.658 --> 02:13:21.960
MAKES WILL ALSO I AM A FIRST

02:13:22.027 --> 02:13:23.895
NOT UNLIKE MY COLLEAGUE I DON'T

02:13:23.962 --> 02:13:24.963
KNOW A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:26.131
AND HAVE HAD TO LEARN ABOUT

02:13:26.198 --> 02:13:27.599
THEM OVER THE OURSE OF THE

02:13:27.666 --> 02:13:30.936
LAST COUPLE WEEKS OR SO- AND

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:32.471
EVEN ON THE AMOUNT THAT FEW DID

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:33.605
PUT THEM IN FRONT OF ME I

02:13:33.672 --> 02:13:34.873
WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT LOOK LIKE A

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.341
LOT OR A LITTLE TO BE HONEST

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:39.144
WITH YOU BUT- I WILL AND I DO

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:41.413
HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS SIMILAR.

02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:42.347
TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS

02:13:42.414 --> 02:13:43.315
ANGELES IN THE FACT THAT I

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:44.816
WOULD ORIGINALLY THIS THOUGHT

02:13:44.883 --> 02:13:46.418
THERE WAS JUST NO WAY I COULD

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:47.052
VOTE FOR THIS I WANT TO THANK

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:50.655
THE CHAIR. I AM THE AUTHOR AND

02:13:50.722 --> 02:13:52.891
THE NUMBER OF FOR THEIR

02:13:52.958 --> 02:13:54.559
AMENDMENTS THEY IT IT MADE IT

02:13:54.626 --> 02:13:55.694
MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO

02:13:55.761 --> 02:13:57.195
UNDERSTAND AND KIND OF GET TO

02:13:57.262 --> 02:13:58.864
GET TO THE PLACE WHERE I COULD

02:13:58.930 --> 02:13:59.865
I COULD SEE THAT THIS WAS

02:13:59.931 --> 02:14:01.867
NECESSARY I THINK IT HELPS FOR

02:14:01.933 --> 02:14:03.101
ME TO KNOW THAT THEIR IT IS

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:04.703
UNDER FDA APPROVAL A LOT OF

02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:06.671
THESE DRUGS ARE. BEING REVIEWED

02:14:06.738 --> 02:14:08.106
BY THE FDA FOR THEIR CLINICAL

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:09.241
PURPOSES I THINK THAT'S

02:14:09.307 --> 02:14:11.576
ESPECIALLY HELPFUL AND I DO

02:14:11.643 --> 02:14:12.644
THINK THAT THE SHARE PROVISION

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.613
THAT THE CHAIR AND PUT IN PLACE

02:14:14.679 --> 02:14:16.181
THAT ACTUALLY DOESN'T NARAL

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:17.282
WHAT SHARE MEANS AND WHAT IT

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:19.851
LOOKS LIKE- HELPS ME UNDERSTAND

02:14:19.918 --> 02:14:21.720
THAT REALLY THE GOAL IS TO PAY

02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:22.454
FOR IT TO BE EXCHANGED WITH A

02:14:22.521 --> 02:14:24.623
CLINICIAN- ON A VERY SMALL

02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:26.224
LEVEL AND ON A MICRO DOES OR

02:14:26.291 --> 02:14:27.659
WHATEVER THE PROPER TERM WOULD

02:14:27.726 --> 02:14:29.261
BE ON ALL OF THESE DRUGS I

02:14:29.327 --> 02:14:30.495
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A STANDARD

02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:32.831
TERM ACROSS THE BOARD- BUT I DO

02:14:32.898 --> 02:14:34.065
THINK THAT THAT IS VERY HELPFUL

02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:35.233
TO KNOW THE FDA'S. IS IN THE

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:36.601
PROCESS OF APPROVING A LOT OF

02:14:36.668 --> 02:14:37.969
THESE FOR THERAPEUTIC USE AND

02:14:38.036 --> 02:14:39.671
THAT THESE THESE DOSES ARE

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:43.542
CONSIDERED MICRO. DOSE- IN

02:14:43.608 --> 02:14:44.109
THEIR SPECIALTIES. FOR ME.

02:14:44.176 --> 02:14:45.343
OBVIOUSLY DECRIMINALIZATION IS

02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:46.545
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR MY

02:14:46.611 --> 02:14:48.914
COMMUNITY. OB I HAVE THE SAME

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:50.949
ISSUES. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:14:51.016 --> 02:14:52.451
CARILLO OF DRUG USE IN MY

02:14:52.517 --> 02:14:54.786
COMMUNITY HOWEVER. I THINK THAT

02:14:54.853 --> 02:14:56.087
THE DEMAND TO CRIMINALIZATION

02:14:56.154 --> 02:14:58.390
AT THESE LEVELS I THINK IF. I

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:00.091
CAN'T SEE AS BEING ACCEPTABLE

02:15:00.158 --> 02:15:02.027
THEN I DO THINK. THAT FOR THOSE

02:15:02.093 --> 02:15:03.495
WHO STRUGGLE WITH SOME OF THESE

02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:04.796
THERAPEUTIC ISSUES TO HAVE TO

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:06.064
LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND WHATEVER

02:15:06.131 --> 02:15:07.632
VETERANS WHICH I THINK.

02:15:07.699 --> 02:15:09.734
OBVIOUSLY FIRST TIER VETERANS

02:15:09.801 --> 02:15:10.969
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:12.070
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:13.472
BEING WE- PUT THEM IN THAT

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:15.707
SITUATION. SO WHATEVER WE CAN

02:15:15.774 --> 02:15:17.843
DO TO CREATE ALLEVIATE THE PAIN

02:15:17.909 --> 02:15:19.578
THAT THEY HAVE IT INTO WORD.

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:20.712
AND THE MENTAL ANGUISH THAT

02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:21.880
THEY AREN'T HAVE HAVE AND

02:15:21.947 --> 02:15:23.415
CONTINUE TO INDOOR. IS OUR

02:15:23.482 --> 02:15:25.517
RESPONSIBILITY. AND TO DO IT

02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:26.785
CAREFULLY LIKE I BELIEVE THIS

02:15:26.852 --> 02:15:28.520
BILL HAS NARROWED IT TO YOU. I

02:15:28.587 --> 02:15:30.822
THINK IS VITAL. I ALSO THINK

02:15:30.889 --> 02:15:33.692
IT'S- I WAS I WAS SAD TO HEAR

02:15:33.758 --> 02:15:34.292
SOME OF THE STORIES ABOUT THE

02:15:34.359 --> 02:15:35.627
FAMILIES THAT HAVE HAD TO SEND

02:15:35.694 --> 02:15:36.695
THEIR KIDS AWAY. OTHER

02:15:36.761 --> 02:15:38.296
COUNTRIES. IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:15:38.363 --> 02:15:39.297
KNOWING THAT THEY WERE GOING

02:15:39.364 --> 02:15:41.333
THROUGH THESE DAYS ADDICTIONS

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:42.467
AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND

02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:43.969
HAVING TO SEND THEM. THEIR KIDS

02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:46.104
AWAY FROM THEM. THEIR FAMILIES

02:15:46.171 --> 02:15:46.905
I KNOW I DON'T LIKE SENDING MY

02:15:46.972 --> 02:15:48.874
KID TO DISNEYLAND. NOT TO

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:49.941
MENTION CENTER OF THE COUNTRY

02:15:50.008 --> 02:15:51.443
WHEN SHE'S AT OUR WEAKEST I.

02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:53.578
GUESS I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:54.946
THAN THAT FOR OUR FAMILIES AND

02:15:55.013 --> 02:15:56.515
FOR OUR VETERANS. SO WITH THAT

02:15:56.581 --> 02:15:58.083
I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:59.651

RECOMMENDATION- YOU KNOW I

02:16:24.809 --> 02:16:25.710

FROM MEMBERS HERE IS ARE NOT

02:16:27.546 --> 02:16:28.914
UNLIKE THE CAN SOME OF THE

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:31.283

02:16:33.318 --> 02:16:35.520
ME. IS THE- IS THE GROUP

02:16:35.587 --> 02:16:36.955

WORKING TO WITH FACILITATED.

02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:42.694
CARE FOR PEOPLE. I DON'T

02:16:42.761 --> 02:16:44.029
BELIEVE THIS IS LIKE GOING OUT

02:16:44.095 --> 02:16:45.163
ON THE STREET CORNER AND BUYING

02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:46.998
SOMETHING AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER

02:16:47.065 --> 02:16:48.466
AND THIS ISN'T EVEN THERE ISN'T

02:16:48.533 --> 02:16:49.901
EVEN A REAL THIS IS IN THE

02:16:49.968 --> 02:16:51.269
SALES OF THIS ISN'T THIS IS

02:16:51.336 --> 02:16:52.804

TOGETHER AS- AND SELLING THIS

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:55.840
TO PEOPLE THAT'S NOT THE WAY

02:16:55.907 --> 02:16:59.177
THIS IS WORKING. I THINK OF-

02:16:59.244 --> 02:17:00.946
YOU KNOW IT WASN'T. IT WASN'T

02:17:01.012 --> 02:17:02.080
JUST BUT BUT JUST THREE YEARS

02:17:02.147 --> 02:17:04.215
AGO MAYBE MAYBE FOR THAT THE

02:17:04.282 --> 02:17:07.852
FDA ACTUALLY APNA PROVED- A

02:17:07.919 --> 02:17:09.254
CANNABIS THROUGH A CANNABIS

02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:11.489
DERIVED- MEDICATION FOR THE

02:17:11.556 --> 02:17:13.258
TREATMENT OF SEIZURES IN YOUNG

02:17:13.325 --> 02:17:17.295
CHILDREN IT'S TAKEN. HOW LONG

02:17:17.362 --> 02:17:18.463
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN ANOTHER

02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:19.898
OTHERS OTHER THINGS ARE COMING

02:17:19.965 --> 02:17:21.933
ALONG SO ARE APPROVAL PROCESS

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.435
IS REALLY REALLY CHALLENGING

02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:24.502
AND SO THE IDEA THAT A

02:17:24.569 --> 02:17:26.438
PHYSICIAN MIGHT ACTUALLY DO

02:17:26.504 --> 02:17:27.772
THIS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:17:27.839 --> 02:17:29.240
BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR

02:17:29.307 --> 02:17:31.376
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT IS- I

02:17:31.443 --> 02:17:35.680
CAN SEE WOULD BE OF CONCERN- SO

02:17:35.747 --> 02:17:37.816
FOR ME- THE OPPORTUNITY WITH

02:17:37.882 --> 02:17:39.551
THE SPONSORS OF THIS AND HEAR

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:41.553
THOSE STORIES AND THE

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.722
REALIZATION- I WAS CONVINCED.

02:17:43.788 --> 02:17:45.223
OF THE THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:46.558
MANY OF THESE SUBSTANCES AND

02:17:46.625 --> 02:17:47.659
THE ROLE THE IMPORTANT ROLE

02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:49.628
THEY CAN PLAY IN IN TREATMENT

02:17:49.694 --> 02:17:52.063
FOR A PTSD ANXIETY DEPRESSION

02:17:52.130 --> 02:17:53.131
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT

02:17:53.198 --> 02:17:55.767
BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND TO OTHER

02:17:55.834 --> 02:17:57.836
OTHER MODALITIES. IT'S THERE'S

02:17:57.902 --> 02:17:59.304
A LOT OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE GO

02:17:59.371 --> 02:18:00.338
THROUGH TO GET TO THIS POINT

02:18:00.405 --> 02:18:01.706
AND AS YOU HEARD AS WE HEARD

02:18:01.773 --> 02:18:02.741
FROM SOME OF THE FAMILIES.

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:04.509
APPARENTLY PARTICULAR THEY WENT

02:18:04.576 --> 02:18:05.510
THROUGH EVERYTHING WITH THEIR

02:18:05.577 --> 02:18:07.445
WITH THEIR WITH THEIR SON TO

02:18:07.512 --> 02:18:08.780
TRY TO GET TO THIS POINT AND

02:18:08.847 --> 02:18:10.682
THIS WAS LIKE THE LAST RESORT

02:18:10.749 --> 02:18:12.350
AND IT MADE A DIFFERENCE AND TO

02:18:12.417 --> 02:18:12.984
ME THAT'S PRETTY THAT'S PRETTY

SOONER BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO

03:04:27.589 --> 03:04:28.891
GO FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT

03:04:28.957 --> 03:04:29.958

ABLE TO GET THE MEDICATION.

03:04:40.369 --> 03:04:42.571
SONJI SIMILAR TO BEING

03:04:42.638 --> 03:04:44.773
UNINSURED BEGINNING. MANY

03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:46.208
STUDIES SHOW THAT PATIENT NOT

03:04:46.275 --> 03:04:47.509
ADHERENCE TO PRESCRIBE

03:04:47.576 --> 03:04:48.677
MEDICATION LEADS TO POOR

03:04:48.744 --> 03:04:50.612
THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES

03:04:50.679 --> 03:04:51.847

03:04:51.914 --> 03:04:53.882
ESTIMATED TO BE BILLIONS IN

03:04:53.949 --> 03:04:55.984
AVOIDABLE HEALTH CARE COST. AND

03:04:56.051 --> 03:04:57.486
CERTAINLY OF COURSE IN ADDITION

03:04:57.553 --> 03:04:58.687
TO THE FINANCIAL COST THE

03:04:58.754 --> 03:05:00.456
HEALTH COSTS AS WELL IN

03:05:00.522 --> 03:05:02.691
SOCIETAL COSTS. ADVERSE

03:05:02.758 --> 03:05:03.759
CONSEQUENCES MAY NOT

03:05:03.826 --> 03:05:05.093
NECESSARILY BE IMMEDIATE SO THE

03:05:05.160 --> 03:05:06.528
EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH

03:05:06.595 --> 03:05:07.896
INCREASING ADHERENCE MAY NOT BE

03:05:07.963 --> 03:05:09.731
THE BIGGEST CONCERN. FOR SOME

03:05:09.798 --> 03:05:11.099
PLAYERS HOWEVER THERE'S

03:05:11.166 --> 03:05:12.334
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE

03:05:12.401 --> 03:05:14.269
LONG TERM COSTS THE POOR

03:05:14.336 --> 03:05:16.271

HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF

03:05:20.776 --> 03:05:22.077
AVOIDABLE HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE

03:05:22.144 --> 03:05:23.445
BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO NOT

03:05:23.512 --> 03:05:24.480
ADHERENCE IN THE UNITED STATES

03:05:24.546 --> 03:05:28.083

REDUCING OUT OF POCKET COSTS

03:05:32.154 --> 03:05:33.222
LEAD TO BETTER MEDICATION

03:05:33.288 --> 03:05:35.190
ADHERENCE CROSS MANY DIAGNOSES

03:05:35.257 --> 03:05:36.058
IN FACT THERE'S A LINEAR

03:05:36.124 --> 03:05:37.292
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

03:05:37.359 --> 03:05:38.861
MAGNITUDE OF PATIENT COST

03:05:38.927 --> 03:05:39.361
SHARING IN THE LEVEL OF

03:05:39.428 --> 03:05:42.464

03:05:44.199 --> 03:05:46.768
SIGNIFICANT COSTS BUT- IT

03:05:46.835 --> 03:05:49.338
THAT'S F. BUT ALSO ESTIMATES A

03:05:49.404 --> 03:05:49.905

WITH AN OFFSETTING ESTIMATE SO

03:06:01.683 --> 03:06:04.219
THE NET COST INDIA ANALYSIS IS

03:06:04.286 --> 03:06:06.054
LIKELY INFLATED. ADDITIONALLY

03:06:06.121 --> 03:06:07.356
AS I MENTIONED MANY OF THE COST

03:06:07.422 --> 03:06:09.358
SAVINGS OCCUR OVER TIME AND NOT

03:06:09.424 --> 03:06:10.392

03:07:26.234 --> 03:07:27.703
DEDUCTIBLE THEY WOULD HAVE THAT

03:07:27.769 --> 03:07:29.271
SUBSIDY IN THEIR STOCK WITH THE

03:07:29.338 --> 03:07:31.006
HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN. IN

03:07:31.073 --> 03:07:33.008
ADDITION I ALSO AGREED TO A

03:07:33.075 --> 03:07:35.444
SUNSET SO WE CAN SEE THE IMPACT

03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:36.378
I BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:07:36.445 --> 03:07:40.048
FOR YOUR SUNSET IN AN

03:07:40.115 --> 03:07:40.682
EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE

03:07:40.749 --> 03:07:41.283
BILL. THE PLACE WHERE I THINK

03:07:41.350 --> 03:07:43.518
UNFORTUNATELY- WE REMAINED AND

03:07:43.585 --> 03:07:46.421
DISAGREEMENT IS- THE IDEA OF

03:07:46.488 --> 03:07:48.657
ACTUALLY SELECTING DISEASES-

03:07:48.724 --> 03:07:49.925
THAT WOULD COVER FOR THE BILL

03:07:49.992 --> 03:07:51.760
AND I APPRECIATE THAT- THERE'S

03:07:51.827 --> 03:07:53.762
A DESIRE TO AGAIN. TRY TO

03:07:53.829 --> 03:07:56.298
REDUCE THE- PERHAPS THE COST OF

03:07:56.365 --> 03:07:57.466
THE BILL BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE

03:07:57.532 --> 03:07:59.835
THAT. WHEN I. STARTED THIS

03:07:59.901 --> 03:08:03.205
BILL. BOTH THE SUPPORTERS BUT

03:08:03.271 --> 03:08:04.606
INCLUDING THE OPPOSITION TO

03:08:04.673 --> 03:08:06.241
HEALTH PLANS WHO ARE AND FORTY

03:08:06.308 --> 03:08:08.143
OPPOSED TO THE BILL. HAVE BOTH

03:08:08.210 --> 03:08:09.011
EXPRESSED TO ME THEY DIDN'T

03:08:09.077 --> 03:08:10.612
WANT TO APPROACH. CHRONIC

DISEASE MEDICATION DEDUCTIBLES

03:08:12.848 --> 03:08:14.850
ON THE DISEASE BY DISEASE BASIS

03:08:14.916 --> 03:08:17.185
THEY WANTED A POLICY THAT CAR

03:08:17.252 --> 03:08:19.855
CUT ACROSS. FOR THIS PARTICULAR

03:08:19.921 --> 03:08:21.390
PROBLEM AND AGAIN WE'RE TALKING

03:08:21.456 --> 03:08:23.058
ABOUT PEOPLE CRIED DISEASES.

03:08:23.125 --> 03:08:24.259
WHO NEED TO BE ON THEIR

03:08:24.326 --> 03:08:25.694
MEDICATION AND NOR TO KEEP

03:08:25.761 --> 03:08:27.496
THEMSELVES HEALTHIER SO THEY

03:08:27.562 --> 03:08:29.698
DON'T HAVE EXACERBATIONS. AND

03:08:29.765 --> 03:08:31.867
IT IS. TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING

03:08:31.933 --> 03:08:33.068
TO SAY WELL THEN WHICH DISEASES

03:08:33.135 --> 03:08:33.969

CDC. BUT THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE

03:08:39.374 --> 03:08:41.043
FOR EXAMPLE. MENTAL HEALTH

SCHIZOPHRENIA. WHO NEEDS THEIR

03:08:45.247 --> 03:08:46.481
MEDICATION SO THAT THEY CAN

03:08:46.548 --> 03:08:48.383
CONTINUE TO HAVE A STABLE HOME

03:08:48.450 --> 03:08:50.952
AND GO TO WORK SO THAT THE

03:08:51.019 --> 03:08:51.553
HOUSE ACTIVATIONS ARE SOME OF

03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:53.689

WHO HAS A NEUROLOGICAL

03:09:03.065 --> 03:09:05.100
CONDITION THAT AGAIN REQUIRES

03:09:05.167 --> 03:09:07.035
ONGOING TREATMENT FOR THEM OR

03:09:07.102 --> 03:09:08.303
FOR THEM NOT ONLY OF COURSE TO

03:09:08.370 --> 03:09:09.871
TREAT THEIR CONDITION BUT ALSO

03:09:09.938 --> 03:09:10.972
ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO

03:09:11.039 --> 03:09:12.974
FUNCTION. AND EVEN HOLD THE JOB

03:09:13.041 --> 03:09:14.376
SO WE CAN'T THERE'S NUMEROUS

03:09:14.443 --> 03:09:16.511
CONDITIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE.

03:09:16.578 --> 03:09:18.213
AT THAT OFFICE THE SAME PROBLEM

03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:19.314
IS THAT IF YOU'RE IN A HIGH

03:09:19.381 --> 03:09:21.717
DEDUCTIBLE PLAN. IF YOU DON'T

03:09:21.783 --> 03:09:23.685

COPAY. THEN ESSENTIALLY YOU ARE

03:09:34.796 --> 03:09:35.864
OUT OF LUCK IN TERMS OF BEING

03:09:35.931 --> 03:09:37.299
ABLE TO PAY FOR YOUR MEDICATION

03:09:37.365 --> 03:09:39.167
TELL YOU SAVE ENOUGH MONEY. AND

03:09:39.234 --> 03:09:40.836
INSTEAD WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

03:09:40.902 --> 03:09:41.436
YOU STOP TAKING YOUR

03:09:41.503 --> 03:09:43.205

IS NOT THE PRO TO UNDERTAKE- WE

03:09:55.884 --> 03:09:57.285
WENT AHEAD AND THINK ABOUT HOW

03:09:57.352 --> 03:09:58.086

THE PHARMACY COUNTER. 45% OF

THE TIME. THIS IS ESPECIALLY

03:15:01.289 --> 03:15:03.358
PROBLEMATIC WHEN A PATIENT IS

03:15:03.425 --> 03:15:05.427
NEW TO THEIR PRESCRIPTION

03:15:05.493 --> 03:15:06.828

MARKET PLACE IS THE ONE THAT

03:16:04.385 --> 03:16:06.254
WOULD HAVE BENEFITED THE MOST

03:16:06.321 --> 03:16:07.489
SO WE WOULD WANT TO SEE A STUDY

03:16:07.555 --> 03:16:10.325

03:16:10.391 --> 03:16:12.460
AT HOW ADHERENCE IS IMPACTED BY

TAKING OPPOSE POSITION ON SB

03:16:39.988 --> 03:16:41.289
FIVE SIXTY EIGHT. BUT WE OPPOSE

03:16:41.356 --> 03:16:42.757
THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS THE

03:16:42.824 --> 03:16:44.559
WRONG SOLUTION FOR THE GROWING

03:16:44.626 --> 03:16:46.861
PROBLEM OF DRUG PRICING- BY WAY

03:16:46.928 --> 03:16:49.497
OF BACKGROUND. THE DRUGS USED

03:16:49.564 --> 03:16:50.798
TO TREAT CHRONIC CONDITIONS

03:16:50.865 --> 03:16:51.766
COMMONLY FALL INTO THE

03:16:51.833 --> 03:16:53.301
SPECIALTY DRUG DEFINITION AND

03:16:53.368 --> 03:16:54.235
MEANING THEY ARE USED TO TREAT

03:16:54.302 --> 03:16:55.970
COMPLEX CONDITIONS AND ARE VERY

03:16:56.037 --> 03:16:58.339
EXPENSIVE. THESE ARE OFTEN LIFE

03:16:58.406 --> 03:16:59.974
SAVING MEDICATIONS OF MILLIONS

03:17:00.041 --> 03:17:02.110
OF CALIFORNIANS RELY ON DAILY.

03:17:02.177 --> 03:17:03.978
AND SADLY JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF

03:17:04.045 --> 03:17:06.080
THE HIGH PRICE DRUG CRISIS WE

03:17:06.147 --> 03:17:07.482
DO NOT ADDRESS THIS CRISIS WILL

03:17:07.549 --> 03:17:09.184
CONTINUE TO BURDEN OUR HEALTH

03:17:09.250 --> 03:17:09.751
SYSTEM AND PUT PATIENTS AT

03:17:09.817 --> 03:17:11.819
RISK. HEALTH PLANS ARE DOING

03:17:11.886 --> 03:17:13.655
THEIR PART TO PROVIDE VALUE IN

03:17:13.721 --> 03:17:14.656
ACCESS TO MINERAL IS BY

03:17:14.722 --> 03:17:17.525
COVERING 97% OF THE COST OF

03:17:17.592 --> 03:17:22.263
SPECIALTY DRUGS. AND THAT IS AN.

03:17:22.330 --> 03:17:22.897
INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND

03:17:22.964 --> 03:17:24.632
EIGHTEEN. NO THERE ISN'T. DRUG

03:17:24.699 --> 03:17:26.000
PRICE PROBLEM BECAUSE WHAT

03:17:26.067 --> 03:17:27.869
SPECIALTY DRUGS ACCOUNT FOR ONE

03:17:27.936 --> 03:17:28.903
POINT 5% OF ALL THE

03:17:28.970 --> 03:17:30.672
PRESCRIPTIONS. THEY COMPRISE

03:17:30.738 --> 03:17:33.508
NEARLY FIFTY SIX POINT 1% OF

03:17:33.575 --> 03:17:34.142
ANNUAL SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION

03:17:34.209 --> 03:17:36.878
DRUGS. IN RECOGNITION OF THIS

03:17:36.945 --> 03:17:38.413
OVERALL DRUG PRICING PROBLEM

03:17:38.479 --> 03:17:39.180
THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THIS

03:17:39.247 --> 03:17:40.848
PHENOMENON HEALTH PLANS THAT

03:17:40.915 --> 03:17:41.516
SUPPORTED COMMONSENSE

03:17:41.583 --> 03:17:43.318
SOLUTIONS. AND IT'S INCLUDES

03:17:43.384 --> 03:17:45.119
GREATER TRANSPARENCY LAWS IN

03:17:45.186 --> 03:17:47.488
THE FORM OF S. B. SEVENTEEN-

03:17:47.555 --> 03:17:49.624
FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND

03:17:49.691 --> 03:17:51.059
DESPITE LEGAL CHALLENGES ARE

03:17:51.125 --> 03:17:52.460
FROM THE MANUFACTURERS AND SOME

03:17:52.527 --> 03:17:55.396
COMPLIANCE ISSUES. SB SEVENTEEN

03:17:55.463 --> 03:17:55.997
WE STILL BELIEVE IT'S GROUND

03:17:56.064 --> 03:17:57.799
BREAKING LAW WHICH IS PROVIDE A

03:17:57.865 --> 03:17:59.567
GREAT DEAL OF VALUE TO THE

03:17:59.634 --> 03:18:01.669
DEBATE OVER HIGH PRICE DRUGS-

03:18:01.736 --> 03:18:03.504
WE ALSO APPLY VIA THIRD EFFORTS

03:18:03.571 --> 03:18:05.406
OF THE AUTHOR FROM LAST YEAR.

03:18:05.473 --> 03:18:07.642
I'M IN THE FORM OF SB EIGHT

03:18:07.709 --> 03:18:08.576
FIFTY TWO WHICH WAS INTENDED TO

03:18:08.643 --> 03:18:09.677
INCREASE THE PRODUCTION AND

03:18:09.744 --> 03:18:10.912
DISTRIBUTION OF MORE GENERIC

03:18:10.979 --> 03:18:11.946
DRUGS WITH THE GOAL OF

03:18:12.013 --> 03:18:13.715
INCREASING COMPETITION. THUS

03:18:13.781 --> 03:18:16.050
LOWERING PRICES. THOSE ARE

03:18:16.117 --> 03:18:18.152
SENSIBLE SOLUTIONS ONE DECADE

03:18:18.219 --> 03:18:19.721
AT THE ROOT PROBLEM BOB

03:18:19.787 --> 03:18:21.389
REGRETTABLY FIVE SIXTY TAKES

03:18:21.456 --> 03:18:22.523
THE OPPOSITE APPROACH AND WILL

03:18:22.590 --> 03:18:24.292
NUMBER ONE INCREASE PREMIUMS ON

03:18:24.359 --> 03:18:25.793
INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES EMPLOYERS

03:18:25.860 --> 03:18:27.595
IN YOUR DISTRICTS. INDEED THIS

03:18:27.662 --> 03:18:28.930
IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE HERE

03:18:28.997 --> 03:18:30.231
MANDY BILL THAT HAS BEEN

03:18:30.298 --> 03:18:32.233
INTRODUCED THIS YEAR- AND THIS

03:18:32.300 --> 03:18:33.067
IS BECAUSE WHILE YOU'RE

03:18:33.134 --> 03:18:35.036
REGULATING THE BENEFIT DESIGN

03:18:35.103 --> 03:18:36.104
THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE STILL

03:18:36.170 --> 03:18:36.871
FREE TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS

03:18:36.938 --> 03:18:38.506
WHERE THEY WANT. AND THIS WOULD

03:18:38.573 --> 03:18:40.108
BE AN UNFORTUNATE OUTCOME AS WE

03:18:40.174 --> 03:18:41.676
HAVE SEEN A REMARKABLY LOW

03:18:41.743 --> 03:18:43.044
PREMIUM INCREASES ARE

03:18:43.111 --> 03:18:43.911
PARTICULARLY UP THE COVER

03:18:43.978 --> 03:18:45.713
CALIFORNIA LEVEL OVER THE PAST

03:18:45.780 --> 03:18:48.249
COUPLE OF YEARS. SO BILLS LIKE

03:18:48.316 --> 03:18:49.083
FIVE SIXTY COULD ALSO FOR OUR

03:18:49.150 --> 03:18:50.451
PLAN PRODUCTS OUT OF COMPLIANCE

03:18:50.518 --> 03:18:51.819
WITH FEDERAL AND STATE RULES

03:18:51.886 --> 03:18:54.088
AROUND BENEFIT DESIGN. AND DOES

03:18:54.155 --> 03:18:57.158
REQUIRE UP PLANS TO INCREASE

03:18:57.225 --> 03:18:57.759
OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR OTHER

03:18:57.825 --> 03:19:00.395
SERVICES- AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T

03:19:00.461 --> 03:19:00.928
THINK THAT THAT'S A FAIR

03:19:00.995 --> 03:19:02.997
OUTCOME EITHER- IT IS SECOND

03:19:03.064 --> 03:19:04.399
OUTCOME DOES COME TO PASS A

03:19:04.465 --> 03:19:06.534
SPONSORS OF SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT

03:19:06.601 --> 03:19:09.537
OR BILLS LIKE IT- CUMULATIVELY-

03:19:09.604 --> 03:19:10.571
THEY SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TELL

03:19:10.638 --> 03:19:12.073
POLICYMAKERS WHICH SERVICES

03:19:12.140 --> 03:19:13.474
WOULD SEE AN- INCREASE IN OUT

03:19:13.541 --> 03:19:15.543
OF POCKET COSTS. TO BE START

03:19:15.610 --> 03:19:17.478
THE POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED-

03:19:17.545 --> 03:19:18.813
SO ELIMINATING THE DEDUCTIBLE

03:19:18.880 --> 03:19:20.014
DOES NOTHING TO HELP THE LARGER

03:19:20.081 --> 03:19:21.916
PROBLEM BY JUST REQUIRES COSTS

03:19:21.983 --> 03:19:23.418
TO BE MADE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN

03:19:23.484 --> 03:19:25.753
THE BENEFIT DESIGN. AND SO- YOU

03:19:25.820 --> 03:19:26.921
KNOW WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE HE TENDS

03:19:26.988 --> 03:19:28.022
TO LIMIT THE BILL- BUT THEY

03:19:28.089 --> 03:19:29.290
DON'T ADDRESS THE UNDER. LYING

03:19:29.357 --> 03:19:36.898
FLAWS WITH THE APPROACH OF SB.

03:19:36.964 --> 03:19:37.498
FIVE SIXTY EIGHT AND THOSE ARE

03:19:37.565 --> 03:19:38.099
THE REASONS THAT WE OPPOSE IT

03:19:48.576 --> 03:19:50.044
IS CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED

03:19:50.111 --> 03:19:50.945
AND UNFORTUNATELY WILL HAVE

03:19:51.012 --> 03:19:52.714
LARGE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

03:19:52.780 --> 03:19:55.283
OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH SB

SEVERAL TIMES NOW INDICATE THAT

03:20:04.992 --> 03:20:06.327
SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT WOULD

INCREASE PREMIUMS ON EMPLOYERS

EVEN THOUGH. YOU KNOW SOME

03:29:53.113 --> 03:29:54.481
SPONSOR SAID RELUCTANTLY BUT I

03:29:54.548 --> 03:29:55.683

AFTER ALL AS I POINTED OUT.

03:29:58.686 --> 03:30:00.521
INDIVIDUAL MARKET. EVEN THOSE

03:30:00.587 --> 03:30:01.488
HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLANS YOU HAVE

ACTUALLY DON'T PROVIDE

03:30:18.405 --> 03:30:19.707
ADOPTABLE EFFECT YOU JUST HEARD

03:30:19.773 --> 03:30:20.908
CALPERS DOESN'T BECAUSE THEY

03:30:20.975 --> 03:30:21.842
KNOW IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE

03:30:21.909 --> 03:30:25.179
SENSE- IT'S- THAT IT'S NOT A

03:30:25.245 --> 03:30:26.513
REALLY EFFECTIVE WAY TO CONTROL

03:30:26.580 --> 03:30:27.648
PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS I

03:30:27.715 --> 03:30:28.582
APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION

03:30:28.649 --> 03:30:30.584
STATEMENT ABOUT. YELP REDUCING

03:30:30.651 --> 03:30:32.286
FARMERS NO COST. BUT AGAIN. THE

03:30:32.353 --> 03:30:33.854
DEDUCTIBLE AND AGAIN WE DON'T

03:30:33.921 --> 03:30:35.689
LIMIT TE COPAY THE DEDUCTIBLE

03:30:35.756 --> 03:30:37.024
ITSELF I REALLY A BARRIER TO

03:30:37.091 --> 03:30:38.125
PEOPLE AGAIN WITH CHRONIC

03:30:38.192 --> 03:30:39.793
DISEASES. IN TERMS OF GETTING

03:30:39.860 --> 03:30:41.295
MOVED FORWARD. SO I'M VERY MUCH

03:30:41.362 --> 03:30:42.329
INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT

03:30:42.396 --> 03:30:43.630
DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT WE

03:30:43.697 --> 03:30:45.332
CAN TRY TO TALK ABOUT MAYBE

03:30:45.399 --> 03:30:47.334
VALUE AND SO FORTH BUT I. I DO

03:30:47.401 --> 03:30:49.236
THINK IT'S CHALLENGING TO SAY.

03:30:49.303 --> 03:30:50.571
I HAVE TO TAKE IT JUST FROM A

03:30:50.637 --> 03:30:52.639
GROUP OF DISEASES- BECAUSE YOU

03:30:52.706 --> 03:30:53.374
HAVE PEOPLE WITH RARE

03:30:53.440 --> 03:30:55.009
CONDITIONS WHO DEFINITELY STILL

03:30:55.075 --> 03:30:55.909
NEEDED TO HAVE THEIR FACING THE

03:30:55.976 --> 03:30:57.544
SAME PROBLEM. AS SOMEONE LET'S

03:30:57.611 --> 03:30:59.780
SAY WITH DIABETES OR HIGH BLOOD

03:30:59.847 --> 03:31:00.381
PRESSURE OR SOMETHING THAT'S

03:31:00.447 --> 03:31:03.017
MUCH MORE COMMON. AND SO. I YOU

03:31:03.083 --> 03:31:04.651
KNOW AND AGAIN I SAID THE

03:31:04.718 --> 03:31:05.886
HEALTH PLANS HAVE TOLD ME THEY

03:31:05.953 --> 03:31:07.354
DON'T DO THE DISEASE BY THESE

03:31:07.421 --> 03:31:07.955
APPROACH EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE

03:31:08.022 --> 03:31:09.023
OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THE

03:31:09.089 --> 03:31:10.357
SPONSORS DON'T WANT TO DO IT

03:31:10.424 --> 03:31:11.492
THAT WAY. I'M NOT SURE IT'S

03:31:11.558 --> 03:31:12.960
GOOD POLICY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

03:31:13.027 --> 03:31:14.762
IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN DISEASE.

03:31:14.828 --> 03:31:16.430
YOU'RE OKAY WE DON'T THAT'S NOT

03:31:16.497 --> 03:31:17.064
IT WE'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF

03:31:17.131 --> 03:31:18.365
DETECTABLE BUT YOU HAVE THAT

03:31:18.432 --> 03:31:19.600
OTHER DISEASE WHICH ALSO HAS

03:31:19.666 --> 03:31:20.768
THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS DOES

03:31:20.834 --> 03:31:22.436
CRIME THIS CITY AND IT'S NEAT.

03:31:22.503 --> 03:31:24.171
YOUR NEED TO CONTINUE. SO

03:31:24.238 --> 03:31:26.473
PERHAPS AGAIN I LOOK FOR TO

03:31:26.540 --> 03:31:27.408
DIALOGUE YOU KNOW MAYBE WE CAN

03:31:27.474 --> 03:31:29.176
LOOK AT VALUE LIKE OKAY IS THE

03:31:29.243 --> 03:31:30.844
DRUG HOW HELPFUL IS THE DRUG TO

03:31:30.911 --> 03:31:31.912
PREVENT YOU FROM. ENDING UP IN

03:31:31.979 --> 03:31:33.714
THE HOSPITAL E. ARE. ALL RIGHT

03:31:33.781 --> 03:31:34.648
AND I THINK THERE'S OTHER

03:31:34.715 --> 03:31:36.250
EFFORTS THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER

03:31:36.316 --> 03:31:37.618
WHICH I KNOW WE HAVE TO

03:31:37.684 --> 03:31:39.286
ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE OVERALL

03:31:39.353 --> 03:31:41.722
COST OF THE DRUG. RIGHT TO TRY

03:31:41.789 --> 03:31:42.923
TO BRING THAT DOWN- DIFFERENT

03:31:42.990 --> 03:31:45.959
TYPES OF POLICIES- BUT- I DO

03:31:46.026 --> 03:31:47.428
THINK THAT AND I HOPE WHAT I

03:31:47.494 --> 03:31:48.629
LOOK FOR TO AN ONGOING

03:31:48.695 --> 03:31:50.697
DIALOGUE. THAT TRYING TO PICK.

03:31:50.764 --> 03:31:52.633
WHICH DISEASE AND I UNDERSTAND

03:31:52.699 --> 03:31:53.901
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM IN

03:31:53.967 --> 03:31:55.102
TERMS OF SAYING WELL THAT'S ONE

03:31:55.169 --> 03:31:56.303
WAY TO NARROW DRUG BUT I THINK

03:31:56.370 --> 03:31:59.139
I THINK THAT. THAT CREATES A

03:31:59.206 --> 03:32:00.407
LOT OF CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF

03:32:00.474 --> 03:32:02.509
WHY THIS DISEASE VERSES THAT IS

03:32:02.576 --> 03:32:03.510
IT MORE BECAUSE IT'S MORE

03:32:03.577 --> 03:32:05.212
COMMON THERE FOR YOUR TICKET.

03:32:05.279 --> 03:32:06.046
YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT THIS HE'S

03:32:06.113 --> 03:32:07.014
LIKE SICKLE CELL THE MAINLY

03:32:07.081 --> 03:32:08.415
AFFECTS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

03:32:08.482 --> 03:32:13.587
POPULATION AND. WE MENTIONED

03:32:13.654 --> 03:32:14.154
EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE THE OF

03:32:14.221 --> 03:32:14.788
CANCER. OTHER YOUNG VICE GIVE A

03:32:14.855 --> 03:32:16.156
RARE. NEAR LA. THE WHY IS IT SO

03:32:16.223 --> 03:32:18.325
NOW. FOR YOU. PURSES A LOT NOW

03:32:18.392 --> 03:32:19.493
YOU SAY THE DRUG ITSELF IS NOT

03:32:19.560 --> 03:32:21.028
AS EFFECTIVE OR DOESN'T HAVE

03:32:21.095 --> 03:32:22.162
IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF

03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:23.363
CONVERSATION BUT I THINK IF

03:32:23.430 --> 03:32:25.099
IT'S IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

03:32:25.165 --> 03:32:27.134
GONNA KEEP YOU HEALTHY. WHY DO

03:32:27.201 --> 03:32:28.569
WE PUT YOU KNOW AND TO KEEP YOU

03:32:28.635 --> 03:32:31.105
OUT OF HOSPITAL AND- ALLOW YOU

03:32:32.272 --> 03:32:33.740
QUALITY OF LIFE WE CAN GET YOU

03:32:33.807 --> 03:32:34.741
TO GO TO WORK AND HAVE THESE

03:32:34.808 --> 03:32:36.577
VALLEY. THEN THE QUESTION IS

03:32:36.643 --> 03:32:37.211
WHY DO WE WANT HIGHER

03:32:37.277 --> 03:32:39.413

WELL. AND WE WON'T HAVE THAT

03:32:51.959 --> 03:32:53.727
DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN TRY

03:32:53.794 --> 03:32:55.796
TO DO THE MOVE- THE- YOUNG.

03:32:55.863 --> 03:32:59.333
