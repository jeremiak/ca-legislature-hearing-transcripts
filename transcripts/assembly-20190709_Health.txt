STARTED WITH OUR COMMITTEE HERE YOU'LL SEE THAT OUR COMMITTEE IS SMALL RIGHT NOW. BUT THERE'S A COUPLE OF US THAT CAN -- WE GET THIS -- GET THE COMMITTEE STARTED SO JUST SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS BEFORE WE BEGIN -- THIS IS A HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR SPOCK ISSUEWHEN MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE -- WE DO HAVE A WILL HAVE TIME LIMITS TODAY -- WE'LL HEAR TWO WITNESSES PER SIDE WITH A TIME LIMIT OF THREE MINUTES EACH. ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WE ASK THE STATE ONLY THEIR NAME AN ORGANIZATION OR POSITION ON THE MEASURE -- WE HAVE SOME BILLS PROPOSED FOR A CONSENT TODAY.

I BELIEVE THAT -- THE FIRST ORDER I THINK SENATOR WIENER IS GOING TO PRESENT FIRST -- AND THEN -- SENATOR TO RAZA WILL COME LATER SO YOU HAVE TO BILLS BEFORE CENTER WE HEARING GOING TO START WITH SENATE BILL FORTY AS YOU WISH. I THANK YOU I MISTER CHAIRMAN. ON STARTING WITH A SENATE BILL FORTY I FIRST WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF -- FOR WORKING. WITH US AS WE DID LAST YEAR WITH US WITH HIM FORTY FIVE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEALTH COMMITTEE WORKED VERY CLOSELY AND COOPERATIVELY WITH US -- IT WHICH MAKES THE PROCESS A LOT EASIER AND SO WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE. OF THAT AND AS YOU KNOW -- WE ARE CROSSED AMENDMENTS -- BEFORE JUDICIARY REFLECTING ALL OF THE DURING THE AGREED -- TO AND THEM AND SO THAT IS -- IMPRINT -- SB -- FORTY IS AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THE HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP -- BILL THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR SB -- TEN FORTY FIVE CAN BE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED -- GUY -- DOING WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE GOING TO UNDERMINE IMPLEMENTATION. ON AS WELL AS DOING CONTINUING TO DO WORK TO ENSURE -- THAT THIS IS TRULY A LAST RESORT -- THERE WERE RESPECTING THE THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OF PEOPLE UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR CONSERVATORSHIP IN THE WERE STRIKING THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE. BETWEEN HELPING TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES WHO WERE IN SEVERE DISTRESS AND VERY DEBILITATED BECAUSE OF MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. WHILE ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT CONSERVATORSHIP IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T STRAIN SOMEONE'S FREEDOM FOR A PERIOD. OF TIME I THINK WE HAVE STRUCK THAT BALANCE AND I THINK SB FORTY WILL ALLOW THE HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS ALREADY VOTED TO OPT IN -- AND POTENTIALLY -- IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY - WE ARE SEEING A CRISIS UNFOLDING ON OUR STREETS AND AND TO MANY PLACES IN CALIFORNIA. AND I CAN SPEAK FROM US CERTAINLY FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO. ARE PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SEVERE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER -- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT -- PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME CHALLENGES WERE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON INCAPABLE OF MAKING DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES INCAPABLE. OF ACCEPTING VOLUNTARY SERVICES AND WHO ARE UNRAVELLING AND ULTIMATELY DYING ON OUR STREETS USE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE SEE. ON THE STREETS SLEEPING IN THEIR OWN FECES ARE RUNNING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET SCREAMING OUR CARS -- PEOPLE WHERE PEOPLE WALK BY. OUR CONSTITUENTS WALK BY. AND SAY WHY IS NO ONE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PERSON THIS PERSON NEEDS HELP THIS PERSON IS IN CRISIS. AND THE REASON IS THAT OUR LAWS. THAT WERE ADOPTED IN RESPONSE. TO THE VERY IN HUMANE HOSPITALS OF THE PAST WHERE PEOPLE WERE BEING HOSPITALIZED WHO DIDN'T NEED TO BE THERE -- THESE THE LAWS IN SOME. CASES ARE TOO RESTRICTIVE IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE THE HELP. THEY NEED I SAID THIS LOT BILL WILL HELP US GET PEOPLE THE HELP THAT THEY NEED -- TO EVEN BE ELIGIBLE EVEN TAKE THE FIRST STEP TO BE IT EVEN AS AN INITIAL MATTER ELIGIBLE A PERSON HAS TO BE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES. AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES AND A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD -- UNDER AMENDMENTS THAT WE TAKE AND YOU HAVE TO RECEIVE NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU GOT TO BE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY THAT YOU MIGHT BE A CANDIDATE -- FOR CONSERVATORSHIP -- WE HAVE RESTRUCTURED THIS CONSERVATORSHIP -- SO THAT YOU START WITH A ON AFTER THE EIGHT FIFTY ONE FIFTIES -- THERE'S A TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP OF TWENTY EIGHT DAYS SO WE START ON THE SHORTER SIDE -- AN EVALUATION WILL HAVE TO HAPPEN -- THEN THERE WILL BE WHATEVER JUDICIAL PROCESS -- IS REQUIRED COULD BE A COURT TRIAL ON A COULD BE A JURY TRIAL THE PERSON WILL AS ALWAYS -- HAVE -- COUNCIL IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND THEN IF A IF -- THE EVALUATION SUPPORT SAID IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS SUPPORTS THAT. IT CAN BE EXTENDED TO A FULL SIX MONTH CONSERVATORSHIP -- WITH REGULAR REPORT BACKS IN CASE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TERMINATE THE CONSERVATORSHIP. OUR EARLY ON SO THIS -- I THINK IT'S A GOOD APPROACH AND TO BALANCE APPROACH I BELIEVE IT WILL SAVE LIVES. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AIBO -- WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY -- FROM THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO OUR DOCTOR ANGELICA ALMEIDA WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF FORENSIC AND JUSTICE INVOLVED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AT THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND CAPTAIN SIMON PAYING -- FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT THANK YOU. ARE YOU CAN -- THAT IS A SAVIOR. YEAH AND YOU MIGHT WANNA SIT OVER HERE. GOOD MORNING -- CHAIR WOULD IN COMMITTEE -- GOOD AFTERNOON IT WOULD HELP IF I KNEW WHAT TIME OF DAY IT WAS. FEELS LIKE IT'S A MORNING STILL. THAT'S A LONG DAY. GOOD MORNING -- TO GET I DID IT AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON SURE WOULDN'T COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS DOCTOR AND TELECOM MADE A AND I'M THE DIRECTOR FRIENDS LIKE IN JUST INVOLVE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. INCLUDING PROGRAMS SUCH AS ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT AND COORDINATION FOR LPS CONSERVATORSHIP. ON BEHALF OF MERE BREED AND THE CITY AND COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HEARING THIS FILM AND I WANT TO THANK SENATOR SCOTT WEINER FOR HIS CONTINUED SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP IN CALLING ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH A MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE CRISIS ON OUR STREETS AND ACROSS OUR STATE AND COUNTRY. AND THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND ARE SUFFERING FROM BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE NEEDS. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS THE REALITY IS A SAD REPEATING CYCLE WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS GOING IN AND OUT OF THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND IN SOME CASES BEING ARRESTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS IS DAMAGING TO THEIR HEALTH AND OVERALL WELL BEING. AS A PROVIDER I CAN SHARE THAT THESE ARE THE CASES I STRUGGLE WITH BECAUSE OUR CURRENT LAWS ARE AN ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT AND STABILIZE THEM. LAST YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED SB TEN FORTY FIVE WHICH CREATES AN OPTIONAL NEW CONSERVATORSHIP. IN THE NUMBER OF MONTHS AS WE STARTED TO PREPARE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TEN FORTY FIVE WE'VE IDENTIFIED A FEW AREAS OF THE BILL THAT NEEDS SOME MODIFICATION TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SERVE THE POPULATION THAT WE INTENDED TO SIR. SB FORTY INCLUDE THOSE MODIFICATIONS REINFORCES THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF SB TEN FORTY FIVE AND OFFERS AS A WAY TO REACH AND SUPPORT OUR MOST VULNERABLE IN A RESIDENCE. IT HOWEVER DOES NOT EXPAND THE POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP WHICH IN SAN FRANCISCO IS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN FIFTY AND SEVENTY FIVE OUR CITY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF BEING INNOVATIVE AND PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE CARE AND EITHER I AND MY COLLEAGUES OR MERE BREED. TAKE LIGHTLY THE IDEA OF LIMITING ANYONE CIVIL LIBERTIES. WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO HELP PEOPLE AND THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE WEIGHING IT IS OUR MORAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL LEGAL OBLIGATION. BUT WE MUST NOT TURN BACK ON THOSE IN NEED AND I'M HERE BECAUSE WE HAD THE A CHANCE TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE. AND WITH THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL FORTY WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING JUST THAT. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. CHAIRMAN WOULD ANOTHER MEMBERS. I AM PART OF THE SAN CISCO FIRE DEPARTMENTS COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC TEAM. MSX. WE PARTNER WITH OTHER CLINICIANS TO CONNECT FREQUENTS USERS AT EMS TO SYSTEMS OF CARE. WE HAVE FOUND THAT FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WITH UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS AND SEVERE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. NO AMOUNT OF ENGAGEMENTS OR SERVICE OFFERS WILL IMPROVE THEIR SITUATION. I'LL GET EXAMPLES. JOHN WHO DIED IN AN ER. HAVING BEEN FOUND HYPOTHERMIC BY PARAMEDICS. HE WAS DIABETIC MATH USER. AND CHRONICALLY INCONTINENT. HE HAD MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED EMERGENCY RESPONSES THE YEAR BEFORE HE DIED. MOSTLY BECAUSE OF BYSTANDERS SAW A LEGLESS PERSON COVERED IN EXCREMENT TO COULDN'T GET BACK INTO HIS WHEELCHAIR. FRANK AMET USER. SITS IN HIS WHEELCHAIR AND EXCREMENT ALL DAY HE HAS AN ABSCESS ON HIS BACKSIDE THAT HAS TUNNEL DOWN TO THE BONE. SOMETIMES HE WILL TRY TO GET OUT OF HIS WHEELCHAIR TO DEFECATE IN THE OPEN. FIRST RESPONDERS FIND HIM COVERED IN FECES HIS WOUNDS EXPOSED. UNABLE TO PULL UP HIS PANTS AND GET BACK IN HIS WHEELCHAIR. AND THE LAST TWO YEARS HE HAS ACTIVATED NINE ONE ONE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO TIMES. RICHARD ANOTHER MAC USER USE NINE ONE ONE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT TIMES IN ONE YEAR. HE REPEATEDLY REFUSES SUPPORT OF HOUSING. AND RIDES THE BUS ALL NIGHT. USUALLY. SOIL THAN EXCREMENT. AND ASKED PEOPLE TO CALL 911- WHEN HE GETS TOO ANXIOUS. THIS ONE'S HAPPENED FOUR TIMES IN ONE EVENING. YET ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WAS ADMITTED TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT FOR LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS TWENTY ONE TIMES BETWEEN JANUARY AND APRIL OF THIS YEAR. YET HE INSISTED ON LEAVING SO HE COULD USE METH AND HEROIN. SEVERAL TIMES HE WAS RELEASED AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE AND RE ADMITTED THE VERY SAME DAY. HE DIED IN MAY. WE NEED SB TEN FORTY FIVE AND SB FORTY AS A MEANS OF STOPPING TRAGIC AND UNNECESSARY DEATHS ON THE STREETS. PLEASE HELP COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS DO THE WORK SO DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WE SERVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF SB.

AND TO REMOVE -- THE REQUIREMENT FOR A PHARMACIST ORDER BLOOD WORK -- MY UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH I WILL LET THEM SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES I THINK THOSE ARE THE TWO ISSUES THAT IDENTIFIED SO -- SO THIS SIZE -- THE PURPOSE OF SB ONE FIFTY NINE IS TO EXPAND ACCESS. TO A PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS KNOWN AS PREP AND POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS KNOWN AS PAP -- THESE ARE TWO INCREDIBLY POWERFUL HIV -- PREVENTATIVE -- PREP IS A ONCE A DAY PILL -- THAT IF YOU TAKE A CONSISTENTLY REDUCES YOUR RISK OF HIV INFECTION BY UP 299% -- PAT IS FOR POST EXPOSURE -- WHERE IF YOU BELIEVE YOU'VE BEEN ARE EXPOSED IF YOU START WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS YOU CAN -- HELP PREVENT THE VIRUS FROM TAKING HOLD IN THE BODY IS A REVOLUTIONARY -- DRUGS BACKING AND THE EPIDEMIC THE CAN AND NEW HIV INFECTIONS THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE -- IS ACCESS -- AND ARE MET -- HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY IN THIS WORLD WHO SHOULD BE ON CRAFT -- BUT ARE NOT -- DISPROPORTIONATELY -- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BUT FRANKLY ONCE YOU GET OUTSIDE OF SOME URBAN AREAS IT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE -- AND WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO EXPAND ACCESS AND YES DRUG PRICES ARE TOO HIGH THERE ARE. A LOT OF DIFFERENT BARRIERS TO ONE OF THE BARRIERS -- IS THAT -- IF. AND WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS WILL ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO PROVIDE THE FIRST SIXTY DAYS OF CRAP. AND THE ENTIRE TWENTY EIGHT DAY COURSE A PAP WITHOUT A PHYSICIAN'S PRESCRIPTION -- AND THEN AFTER SIXTY DAYS ON PROP A PERSON WERE TRANSITION INTO A PHYSICIAN'S CARE. ON ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD WITH ACCESS -- WE HAVE A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE AND MANY PARTS OF THE STATE FROM PEOPLE SOMETIMES STRUGGLE TO GET A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT -- IT MAY TAKE A MONTH OR TWO TO EVEN SEE A PHYSICIAN AND WHEN SOMEONE KNOWS THAT THERE ARE AT RISK -- THEY NEED ACCESS RIGHT NOW -- AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL -- WILL HELP US -- TO DO -- SO THE BILL -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING -- CLOSELY -- WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF FOR SOME TIME -- AND WITH THESE LAST TWO AMENDMENTS -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEIR OPPOSITION WILL COME OFF LOOKING SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES -- AND I WANT TO THANK -- THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. FOR WORKING WITH US INTERNET SUMMARY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. OUR COLLABORATION --WITH ME -- TODAY -- OUR SKY LEAVES A POSITION FROM UC DAVIS.

THE OWNER OF THE MISSION WELLNESS PHARMACY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND TAMMY MAR AND WITH THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU PLEASE. FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT SB ONE FIFTY NINE MY NAME IS ACTORS KILEY AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF FAMILY MEDICINE IT IN HIV SPECIALIST PROVIDER. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY PATIENTS MR J. A GAME ANNA RIGHT FOR NEW VISIT IF I DID THAT HE HAD WANTED TO START PROP SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. BUT HAD LEFT WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION AS HE WAS TOLD THE MEDICATION WAS UNNECESSARY WHICH IS NOT WHAT THE CDC IN U. S. PREVENTIVE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDS. ANY LEFT FEELING ASHAMED HIS STORY IS ALL TOO COMMON EVERY DAY HE WAITED INCREASES RISK OF HIV REMINDING ME OF MY OTHER PATIENT MISS ASK. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE WHO IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV AT AGE. SEVENTEEN SB ONE FIFTY NINE WOULD GIVE PATIENTS LIKE MR J. ANOTHER AVENUE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR HEALTH AND COULD HAVE PREVENTED EACH IDEA MISS US. HAPPENED PEP ARE IMPORTANT EFFECTIVE AND SAFE MEDICATIONS TO RENT A LIFE ALTERING ILLNESS. MY PHARMACIST COLLEAGUES ARE QUALIFIED TO WRITE SAFELY PRATT AND PAT. AND WE NEED TO EMPOWER COMMUNITY PHARMACISTS DIVIDE THESE MEDICATIONS SB ONE FIFTY NINE WOULD INCREASE PROP HAD ACCESS AND IS NECESSARY IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ENDING HIV TRANSMISSION AND GETTING. TO ZERO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS COURTNEY MAHER PEARSON AND FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION WORK AB HOW CO SPONSORS OF SB. ONE FIFTY NINE WHICH WOULD -- HELP INCREASE PREP AND ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE AND WILL HELP MAKE SURE THAT PAT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL WHO NEED IT. CURRENTLY PRESS UPS UPTAKE AS YOU'VE HEARD ACROSS THE STATE IS TO LOVE MUCH LOWER THAN WE NEED IF WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS OF GETTING TO ZERO NEW HIV INFECTIONS. DESPITE EFFORTS TO MAKE PROP AND HAVE WIDELY AVAILABLE AT TAKE IS LOWEST AMONG THE POPULATIONS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT. WHO COULD MOST BENEFIT INCLUDING BLACK AND THAT NEXT GAME MEN AND BISEXUAL MEN AND WOMEN AND USE? THESE COMMUNITIES MAY EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO ACCESSING PREP INCLUDING STATE MATHEMATICAL MISTRUST. AND AN INSUFFICIENT NUMBER PROVIDERS WHO ARE COMFORTABLE PRESCRIBING HAPPENED PAT. UNNECESSARY INSURANCE PLAN PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SHOULD NOT ADD TO THOSE BARRIERS. FOR EXAMPLE IN JUST THE LAST -- TWO OR SO MONTHS WE'VE RECENTLY HAD A NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO TRIED TO ACCESS PAT AFTER AN EXPOSURE. AND BEEN UNABLE TO BECAUSE THEIR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION ON THEIR INSURANCE PLAN TAKES MORE THAN THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS AT THE THE MEDICATION AS EFFECTIVE. THIS WOULD AYE OBVIOUSLY PUT THEM OUTSIDE OF THE AFFECT INVESTMENT OVER THE MEDICATION -- AND IS COUNTER TO OUR EFFORTS AT THE STATE TO EXPAND ACCESS -- SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION OPERATES ONE OF THE LARGEST PRIVATE PROVIDERS IN A PET CLINICS AND IN THE CITY AND WE HAVE PRESS NAVIGATORS ON STAFF WERE ABLE TO DO ALL OF THESE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS AND THEY STILL ARE -- INCREASINGLY BURDENED BY MORE AND MORE STEPS AND REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS THAT JUST MAKE ACCESS HARDER -- AND NOT IN A VERY WELL RESOURCE CITY WHERE WHERE YOU KNOW RELEASED HAVE A GOAL OF INCREASING HAVE ACCESS BUT IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT ACCESSES EQUITABLE ACROSS THE STATE -- WHERE RESOURCES ARE NOT THERE TO DO THIS KIND OF -- HEALTH NAVIGATION WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- MEDI CAL REMOVE THE TAR FOR PAT AND PAT BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT IT WAS CAUSING AN UNNECESSARY BARRIER TO CARE IT'S WELL PAST TIME FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS IN THE STATE TO FOLLOW SUIT.

STEPHANIE ONE CANNOT BE HAVE THIS SITUATION A CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE ALSO BUT IT BETWEEN -- WE CURRENTLY HAVE A NEUTRAL POSITION BUT WE DID PROVIDE AN AMENDMENT TO THE AUTHORS STAFF TO CONSIDER ABOUT POTENTIALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T.

THAT WOULD ADD TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TRAINING OF REOCCURRING EDUCATION FOR PHYSICIANS -- INSTRUCTION ON PREP AND PAP BECAUSE WE FOUND -- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA? THAT THERE'S A QUITE A FEW PHYSICIANS WHO DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE. IN DISCUSSING PROP OPEN UP WITH THEIR PATIENTS ARE HAVE NOT BEEN FAMILIAR WITH IT -- I SERVED IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INFECTIOUS DISEASE HIGH RISK COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE BEEN GOING AROUND. AND DURING THE OFF SEASON SO VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS FIND WHEN WE TALK TO FOLKS. IS THE LACK OF ACCESS THE PEOPLE FEEL. THAT THEY CAN GO AND ACTUALLY GET PREP AND PAT OR THE PEOPLE EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT SO YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAD A DESIRE. TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND THEY THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SO. I THINK THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HELP THAT BECAUSE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW ME VOICE PROTECT MY RURAL COMMUNITIES AND THIS BILL IS GOING TO HELP.

MR ASCENDER DRAWS -- CENTER ALLEN HAS NOT HERE WE STILL IN COMMITTEE PRESENT ANOTHER BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE SENATOR ALSO AND WE'LL BE HEARING. FROM YOU ON SENATE BILL TWENTY NINE YES. OKAY. YES. OKAY THANK YOU UP MISTER CHAIR AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. NO BEING ABLE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR IS SOMETHING MOST OF US. TAKE FOR GRANTED BY NOW ESPECIALLY WHEN WE GET OLDER. SB TWENTY NINE ALLOWS ALL CALIFORNIANS. AGE SIXTY FIVE OR OVER. WHO MEET THE INCOME AND RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS TO RECEIVE FULL MEDICAL COVERAGE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS? SEE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE CALIFORNIANS IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. THEY PAY OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN TAXES EVERY YEAR. IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES BUT THEY ARE SHUT OUT FROM PREVENTATIVE CARE. AND DOCTOR VISITS THAT OTHER CALIFORNIANS HAVE. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS UNFAIR AND CRUEL. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AGE SIXTY FIVE OR OVER DON'T HAVE A REGULAR DOCTOR. THEY ARE FORCED TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR CARE. OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS STRONGER AND MORE COST EFFICIENT WELL WE DETECT AND TREAT PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS EARLY. RATHER THAN FORCE PATIENTS TO RESORT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR CARE. STUDIES SHOW EMERGENCY CARE COST THREE TIMES MORE THAN PRIMARY CARE AND THAT PEOPLE PUT OFF CARE UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY GET MUCH MORE BILL. THAT IS NO WAY TO TREAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED REYES FAMILIES AND PAY THEIR SHARE AND TAXES. OUR ELDERS ARE FORCED TO CONTINUE TO WORK. MOST HAVE CHILDREN GRAND CHILDREN SPOUSES WHO ARE US CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS. CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANTS ARE 34% OF THE WORK FORCE TWICE THE NATIONAL ELDER AVERAGE. SOME OF OUR ELDERS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS FOR A SOLUTION FROM WASHINGTON TO NO AVAIL. MANY ARE HELPING TO RAISE THE NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIANS. KNOW ELDER SHOULD SUFFER OR DIE FROM A TREATABLE CONDITION BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. TODAY COLLEAGUES WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO ACT AND MOVED EVEN CLOSER. TO COVERING ALL PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. I KNOW THIS MEASURE REQUIRES FUNDING TO BE IMPLEMENTED HOWEVER NOTHING SHOULD STOP US FROM MAKING A POLICY DECISION. IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE A QUESTION ABOUT WHY WE NEED TO COVER THIS POPULATION BUT INSTEAD HOW WE PROVIDE CARE TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE SENIORS. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO STOP THE BAN ON OUR SENIORS -- AND WE HAVE SOME EXPERTS WHO WILL BE SPEAKING TODAY SO. MISC ABOUT PLEASE. OKAY WHATEVER YOU DECIDE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIDGE JUST A RANDOM WE HAVE HOPE ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WHAT CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION I'M HERE TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR AND SUPPORTER OF SB TWENTY NINE HUNDRED EXTEND MEDIC COLLEGE ABILITY TO LOW INCOME SENIORS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. CALIFORNIA'S TWO POINT TWO MILLION UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE IT CAN SHOOT CONTRIBUTORY SOCIAL UP NOT ECONOMIC FABRIC IN THE STATE. TWO THIRDS OF THE UNDOCUMENTED HAVE BEEN LIVING AND WORKING IN THE STATE FOR OVER A DECADE HOWEVER AS THE WHICH THEIR SENIOR YEARS. THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS OR MEDICARE DESPITE HAVING PAID INTO THE SYSTEM FOR YEARS SIMILAR TO MANY CITIZENS UNLAWFULLY PRESENT. WORKERS HAVE DONE WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA'S STRONGER WHEN EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE THE FOR THE THIRTY THOUSAND LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS ACCESS TO CARE IT'S EITHER LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT. CURRENTLY A DOCUMENT SENIORS ARE ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR RICHARD DISCO FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL. WHICH ONLY COVERS EMERGENCIES AND ONLY STABILIZE THE PATIENT IT DOESN'T TREAT IT MIGHT BE A CHRONIC CONDITION SUCH AS THIS -- DIABETES OR HEART DISEASE OR EVEN IF SOMETHING LIKE CANCER IT DOESN'T COME WITH THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND MEDICAL HOME OR EVEN ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. DEPENDING OR THEY LIVE THEY MIGHT HAVE ACCESS AND COUNTY BASEBALL PROGRAMS BUT IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE THE CARE IS NONEXISTENT. AS A RESULT MANY UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS ARE LIVING SICKER AND DYING YOUNGER AND ARE ONLY ONE MEDICAL EMERGENCY AWAY FROM HOME -- FINANCIAL RUIN YOU TO HIGH MEDICAL COSTS. BY PASSING AS BETWEEN NINE WE CAN ENSURE THAT EVERY SENIOR HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN MEMBER STEVEN BACK NATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER -- CO SPONSOR OF SB TWENTY NINE I'M NOT TOO LONG AGO WE HEARD A STORY FROM SOMEONE WHO REACHED OUT TO US WHOSE MOTHER WAS IN THE HOSPITAL DUE TO CANCER -- SHE WAS ON RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL AND WASN'T ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES TO ACTUALLY GET THE TRANSPLANT THAT SHE NEEDED BECAUSE THE CANCER GOTTEN SO SEVERE -- WHICH REQUIRED EITHER FULL SCOPE OR PRIVATE INSURANCE. I TWO WEEKS LATER SHE PASSED AWAY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS STORY IS NOT UNIQUE -- THIS HAPPENS IN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE ON A DAILY BASIS AND AND WE DO HEAR THOSE STORIES. I WE TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD GET A DEATH SENTENCE JUST BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN EVERYONE DOES DESERVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THOSE SENIORS THAT ARE LOW INCOME WHICH MANY OF THEM ARE LIVING IN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES -- IT'S A REALITY THAT ESCAPES THEM -- UNDER THIS PARTICULAR CLIMATE -- OUR SENIORS YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN LIVING IN A REALLY -- STEVE DRESS -- WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH CONCERNS AND WE JUST SEE THE CRITICAL NATURE HOW URGENT IT IS TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE THAT IS COMPREHENSIVE I'M TO EVERYBODY -- BUT ESPECIALLY OUR SENIORS WHO ARE TRULY IN NEED OF IT AND SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF SB [inaudible] TWENTY NINE THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR.

NO JUST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR -- FOR COMING FORWARD WITH THIS LEGISLATION -- YEAH I HAVE LONG BEEN A BELIEVER THAT -- FOR OUR HEALTH SYSTEM TO BE THE HOT THE HEALTHIEST OF POSSIBLE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY BE A PART OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM -- THE THE SIX CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO SEEK EMERGENCY CARE -- NGUYEN PRIMARY CARE WOULD BE A MORE COST EFFECTIVE A MORE HUMANE WAY OF DELIVERING CARE -- IS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING OF THE PAST -- IT IS CHALLENGING OBVIOUSLY -- FROM AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE AND TO BE ABLE TO TO DO THIS AND I THINK WE HAVE -- MADE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT STRIDES THIS YEAR -- WITH OUR BUDGET AND WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE GOVERNOR TODAY. TO CELEBRATE THAT BUT HE AS I WILL DO NOW POINTED OUT THAT WE ARE ON A JOURNEY. AND THIS JOURNEY WILL TAKE SOME TIME IN THIS JOURNEY WILL TAKE SOME RESOURCES AND WE ALSO. HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ROLLING BACK THE ACA WHICH IS -- WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE FOR EVERYONE I DON'T SAY THAT TO BE A WET BLANKET BUT I JUST SAY THAT -- TO TO THAT WE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TO FIGHT TO PROTECT WHAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT FOR CALIFORNIA HERE SO I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE AND FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I THINK IT IS RIGHT THAT WE HAVE THIS -- THIS IN POLICY AND SO THAT WHEN THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE WE CAN IMPLEMENTED. AND IT'S A SIMPLE IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES PLEASE -- YES I DO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT GOVERNMENT INNER NEWSOME SIGNED A BILL. TO LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND HEALTHCARE COSTS. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT THAT DID NOT INCLUDE. ARE UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS AND MANY MANY MORE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. THEY ARE VERY VERY MUCH A PART OF OUR FAMILIES. THEY ARE INTEGRATED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE WE GO TO CHURCH TOGETHER. WE GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER GO TO WORK TOGETHER THEY OUR US. AND CALIFORNIA IS THEM. AND SOMEHOW WE FIND IT OKAY TO SEGREGATE AND BOUND THEM FOR WHAT OTHER CALIFORNIANS GET. THEY CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED YEAR AFTER YEAR. THEIR HEALTHCARE. IS PUT OFF UNTIL A DAY. THAT IT WILL BE CONVENIENT FOR US IT'S REALLY TIME TO ACT. WE HAVE IT IN OUR POWER WE HAVE IT IN OUR RESOURCES. TO DO SO. THERE'S ALWAYS A COST TO COVERING PEOPLE. INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM FEND FOR THEMSELVES AND DIE UNNECESSARILY. BUT THAT'S THE CHOICE WE HAVE MADE WITH THIS VERY UNEQUAL SYSTEM. IN THE LONG RUN THE COST OF COVERAGE AND WE SAY THIS OVER AND OVER WILL FAR OUTWEIGH THE COST OF DOING NOTHING. IT IS A DOWN PAYMENT ON THE HEALTHY FUTURE OF THE ENTIRE STATE. THE GOVERNOR SAID TODAY. IF YOU BELIEVE IN UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. YOU BELIEVE IN UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. AND IF WE TRULY BELIEVE IN HEALTHCARE AS A HUMAN RIGHT. THEN WE ARE PLEDGED TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR IT -- I WE SHOULD ACT ON THAT. OF I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK THAT THIS COALITION HEALTH FOR ALL DOES EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERYONE WHO SHOWS UP HERE -- IS A SAMPLE OF THE KIND OF WORK THAT THEY DO EVERY DAY THIS IS NOT BEEN EASY -- BUT I GUARANTEE YOU WITH THE WORK THAT THEY DO EVERY DAY -- THERE'S NOTHING THAT WILL INSPIRE ME MORE AND HOPE NOT PEOPLE -- INSPIRE YOU MORE THAN TO DO SOMETHING.

WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON MOVE THE BILL ON THE BILL ADD LIKE -- TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS -- WILL APPRECIATE THAT WERE BOTH WORKING TOWARD THE BOTH GOAL OF OF HELPING TO BRING PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING. SOME LEVEL OF OF RELIEF FROM PAIN. AND ON UNFORTUNATELY HERE CALIFORNIA ARE OR LAWS. MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TERMINALLY ILL. PATIENTS IN DEEP SUFFERING FROM. ACCESS SEEN -- TO RELIEF OPTIONS AND THIS BILL. WOULD MAKE IT. POSSIBLE FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE. A TERMINALLY ILL. IN IN HOSPICE -- TO HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE CANNABIS. TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH. THE THE NAUSEA VOMITING AND PAN THAT IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE ILLNESSES THAT -- CAN BE [inaudible] OF HELPED BY THE USE OF MEDICAL CARE CANNABIS SO. I I INTRODUCED SB THREE OH FIVE KNOWN AS RYAN'S LAW. TO HELP PATIENTS THAT ARE OR FACING SIR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT -- RHYME BARTEL HIMSELF -- ENCOUNTERED AT WHAT HE WAS IN HIS FINAL DAYS I HAVE HIS FATHER HERE -- JIM BARTEL THAT. THAT HIS OF BEEN A CHAMPION FOR THIS ISSUE STATEWIDE -- HIS EXPERIENCE. IN DEALING WITH -- HIS HIS HIS CHILD. IS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WILL. WILL HELP OTHER FAMILIES IN THE FUTURE. TO HELP. THEIR LOVED ONES SCOPE WITH A VERY DIFFICULT TIME IN THEIR LIFE. THE FINAL DAYS OF SOMEBODY'S LIFE SHOULD BE SPENT. IN AGONIZING PAIN. FOR IN UNCONSCIOUSNESS. IN IN HAVING OF PAIN PAIN KILLING DRUGS SET ALSO DRIVE THEM INTO INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS. AND SO -- WHAT WOULD WITH THE? OF COURSE WITH YOUR PERMISSION IS CHIRLA TWO I'D LIKE MISTER BARTEL TO SHARE SOME OF HIS. EXPERIENCE WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY YES. THANK CHAIRMAN WOULD THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF ANY JIM BARTEL I AM THE FATHER BREMER TELL AND THE SPONSORS SENATE BILL THREE ZERO FIVE RISE LAW. THE COMPASSIONATE. ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES ACT. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK YOU TODAY -- BEFORE I CONTINUE I WANTED TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANKS TO SENATOR HUESO FOR HIS. SUBORDINATES IN OFFERING THE BILL. THANK YOU THEN -- I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT RYAN SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHO HE WAS AND WHY THIS LEGISLATURE'S OWN PORT TO BE NAMED IN HIS MEMORY. RIGHT WAS ALWAYS VERY ACTIVE AND COMPASSIONATE PERSON GROWING UP IN SANTEE CALIFORNIA. IN HIGH SCHOOL HE WAS AN EXCELLENTSTUDENT GRADUATING WITH HONORS ACTIVE IN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES IN SEVERAL SPORTS. INCLUDING ALL STATE HONORS FOR HIS CROSS COUNTRY AND JUNIOR SENIOR YEARS. HE RECRUITED BY SEVERAL COLLEGES AND ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO AND RAN TRACK AND CROSS COUNTRY THERE FOR FOUR YEARS. YES SIR FOR FOUR YEARS THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD. HE IS MARRIED TO KATIE AND THEY HAVE A SON CONNOR. WHO IS? TEN RAINY CABLE QUIRK IN CASE STILL AS WORK IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND MULTI WITH AUTISTIC AND SAT DOWN SYNDROME STUDENTS. GET A JOB TAKES NOT ONLY. A LOT OF SPECIAL SKILLS BUT ALSO. GREAT PATIENCE AND COMPASSION IN. RYAN HAD ALL THOSE QUALITIES. EFFECTIVE WITH THE STUDENTS. ANY LUCK WITH -- WORKING WITH THEM AND TOLD ME HOW MUCH IS GOING TO MISS THEM. AND MARCH FIRST OF LAST YEAR RYAN CALLED ME AND MY WIFE. TO TELL US HE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH. STATE FOR PANCREATIC CANCER. AND ONLY HAD A FEW WEEKS TO LIVE. I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS HEARING. MY HEART SANK. HE TURNED FORTY TWO ON MARCH NINTH WHILE HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL AND DIED ON APRIL TWENTY FIRST JUST SEVEN WEEKS AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED. WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN MARCH FIRST IN APRIL TWENTY FIRST? IS WHY I'M HERE TODAY. IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT WAS GIVEN MORPHINE AND SEVERAL OPIOIDS FOR HIS PAIN RELIEF. BUT THEY WEREN'T ENOUGH SO THEY ADDED FENTANYL. WHICH IS A HUNDRED TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN MORPHINE. IN THE RESULT WAS HE WAS ASLEEP MOST THE TIME. DURING ONE OF HIS RARE WAKING MOMENTS HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE SLEEPING. AND S. THE I HELP HIM GET OFF THE PHONE NOW. AND I PROMISED HIM THAT WOULD. YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH THIS WITH KATIE AND CONNOR. HIS PARENTS BROTHER SISTER IN AS MANY FRIENDS. I SUGGEST A MEDICAL CAMPUS IS AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH HE AGREED. TO WE HAD A MEDICAL CAMERAS CAMERAS CREATE A CAMPUS MEDICINE WHICH MEDICINES WHICH WERE DESIGNED. TO SLOW DOWN THE GROWTH OF THE CANCER AND GIVE HIM MORE TIME. AND CAMPUS MEDICINES FOR PAIN RELIEF. BUT WE WERE INFORMED BY THE HOSPITAL THAT THEIR HOSPITAL POLICIES NOT A LOT CAMPUS IN THE HOSPITAL. THE IRONY THAT POLICY IS THAT THE PH&lt;c.cyan&gt; N<u>AND OTHER</u>&lt;/c&gt; OPIOIDS TO KILL SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR. OUR OKAY TO HAVE IN THE HOSPITAL. BUT THAT MEDICAL CANNABIS WHICH HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE. WE'RE ABLE TO TRANSFER HIM TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL THAT ALLOWED CANNABIS THE TOOL IS TO BRING IN THE MEDICINES. AND THEY WOULD REFRIGERATE THEM WITH HIS NAME ON IT AND THEY WOULD HELP ADMINISTER THE DOSAGE. BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SWALLOW ANYTHING NOT EVEN WATER THE CHEMISTRY AT A MEDICAL CANNABIS SUPPOSITORY DESIGNED TO SLOW THE GROWTH OF THE CANCER. AND TO MEDICAL CAMPUS SPRAYS UNDER THE TONGUE FOR PAIN RELIEF. HE ALSO USE MEDICAL CAMPUS PATCHES FOR ANXIETY RELIEF. THE RESULT WAS AMAZING. AWAKE AND ALERT DURING THE DAY HE WAS ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH KATIE AND CONNOR. HIS FAMILY AND HIS FRIENDS WITHOUT PAIN. ALL DAY LONG. AT NIGHT THEY INCREASE THE DOSAGE ALLOWED TO SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT. PAIN FREE. INSTEAD OF SLEEPING FOR THE PH&lt;c.cyan&gt; N<u> THE MEDICAL CAMPUS</u>&lt;/c&gt; PROVIDING WITH THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS FAMILY INTO REMINISCED AND LAUGHED WITH HIS FRIENDS. WE CAME TO VISIT. EVERY TO REALLY -- PATIENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES RYAN. TO SPEND THEIR FINAL DAYS WITH MUCH QUALITY AS MUCH QUALITY AND DIGNITY AS POSSIBLE. THEY ARE DYING. WHY COULDN'T WHY WOULDN'T WE WANT THAT FOR THEM? OPTIONS OTHER THAN SEVERE AND DEBILITATING OPIOIDS LIKE MORPHINE AND FENTANYL SHOULD BE ALLOWED. TO HEALTH CARE VISUALLY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO ALLOW TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AT THE REQUEST OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE HAVE MADE SEVERAL AT IS TO THE BILL. WHICH BETTER DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENTS EXEMPTS CERTAIN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. EXEMPTS EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND SUSPENSE COMPLIANCE WITH THE BILL FOR ANY HEALTH CARE FACILITY THIS OBJECTED TO FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IN CONCLUSION. THE HAPPIEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE WITH THE FIRST TIME I HELP EACH OF MY THREE CHILDREN. THEY WERE BORN. THE SADDEST WHAT MY LIFE WAS HOLDING RISE HE AND MEETING HIS LAST BREATH. MY HOPE IS THE SADDEST MOMENT WILL BE MADE LESS PAINFUL BY ENSURING THAT RYAN'S LAW WILL OUT THOUSANDS OF OTHER TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS. TO LIVE THEIR FINAL DAYS WITH QUALITY AND DIGNITY. THAT HE WAS ABLE TO EXPERIENCE BY USING MEDICAL CANNABIS INSTEAD OF SLEEP INDUCING OPIOIDS LIKE FENTANYL. PLEASE SUPPORT RISE LAW THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. CHAIR MEMBERS ALEX OFTEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. WE HAVE BEEN OPPOSE UNLESS IMMINENT POSITION -- CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS MAY PUT US IN THE CROSSERS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THE NEW ELEMENTS WE JUST GOT THEM A FEW HOURS AGO AND REVIEWING HOPE WE CAN FIND A PATH TO WORK WITH ARE REGULATED THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- TO RESOLVE REMAINING CONCERNS TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS. AGAIN DOES CREATE SOME PROBLEMS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE HAVE PROTECTION THERE SO LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION INTERVIEWING AT THE NEW AMENDMENTS. AND AND WORKING WITH OUR REGULATOR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AMY BLOMBERG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES WE ARE PREVIOUSLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AMENDMENTS. AT THAT THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHORS OFFICE PUT FORWARD AND NOW WORD NEUTRAL. THANK YOU. THE HANDLE SO LEASE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF THIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MAYOR MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE HAD A LATE LAST LETTER OF CONCERN LAST WEEK AND WE ARE INTERESTED TO LOOK INTO THE AMENDMENTS -- BUT OUR CONCERN STEMS FROM THE FACT THAT A NUMBER OF OUR HOSPITALS ALREADY HAVE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE ON THEIR FACILITIES -- RIGHT NOW IT'S ICE AGENTS -- AND NOT ONLY ARE THEY INTIMIDATING FAMILY MEMBERS THE MOST RECENTLY WE HEARD ESPECIALLY IN OUR SAN DIEGO LOCATION THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY STARTING TO APPROACH STAFF. AND ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND WE WORRY THAT ANY POLICY. THAT WOULD PUT OUR HOSPITALS OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW COULD INCREASE THE PRESIDENT PRESENCE OF OTHER FORMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT -- AND FURTHER INTIMIDATE PATIENTS FAMILY AND NOW HOSPITAL STAFF -- FROM THEIR VERY IMPORTANT WORK AND SO WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THESE AMENDMENTS MAKE ADDRESS THERE BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE VOICE THAT CONCERN THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. APOLOGIZE BUT WE SHOULD CREATE A ON BEHALF OF EASE IN SUPPORT. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. AND SEE NO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISS KOREA. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL TO TO THE LEGISLATURE MISTER BARTEL THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR SON'S STORY. I SAW THAT WHEN YOU CAME IN YOU BROUGHT IN A PHOTO OF YOUR SON IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE. FOR MISTER BARTEL TO BE ABLE TO SHOW US -- THE PHOTO RYAN PLEASE. THANK YOU I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORK THAT WE DO IMPACTS PEOPLE AND THEN IMPACTS HUMANS HUMAN LIVES. THAT'S RYAN. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. TO ENSURE THAT THE WORK THAT WE DO WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH. HAS COMPASSION. IN IT. AND WE'RE IN A CHANGING TIME. IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WHERE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND TO DO SOMETHING THAT BRINGS? CALMNESS AS PEOPLE -- COME TO THE END OF THEIR LIFE. DUE TO AN ILLNESS. SO THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR SON STORY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HIM INTO THIS ROOM. THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. I AM SHOCKED BY THE COMMENTS OF THAT WERE JUST MADE ABOUT ICE ENFORCEMENT. AGENTS AT HOSPITALS AND SAN DIEGO INTIMIDATING THAT ONLY PATIENTS BUT ALSO STAFF. I THINK THAT'S A LARGER CONVERSATION TO BE HAD -- AND WHILE THEY'RE OUT THERE ARE CERTAIN -- FEDERAL REGULATIONS SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHEN IT COMES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CANNABIS IN OUR HOSPITALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT'S ALSO VERY REAL. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS A POLICY COMMITTEE. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW THIS WILL IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES HOW I CAN ALLEVIATE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND HOW WE TREAT. THOSE WITH SEVERE ILLNESSES AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH COMPASSION SO YOU HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT ON THIS AND LOOK FORWARD. TO TO FIGURING OUT THE DETAILS AS WE MOVE ALONG THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. MS CURRIE. RENTS ARE YOU DID THAT WAS WAS CREEL MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. BECAUSE WITH THE SAME ANYWAY -- THANK YOU SENATOR FOR AND MISTER BARTEL FOR BRING IN THE BILL FOR IT. IN HONOR OF I'M STRONG STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR -- AND I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE PARTICULAR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN THE STAKEHOLDERS -- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BILL WE NEED TO KEEP IT MOVING.

THANK YOU THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU -- I KNOW WE HAD A CONVERSATION YESTERDAY AND I WILL ADMIT THAT -- AFTER THE CONVERSATION I IT STARTED ME ON A PATH OF THINKING I I WAS WAIT. A BIT LAST NIGHT. THINKING ABOUT THIS REMEMBER IN -- WATCHING -- TO CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS DIE OF CANCER -- AND BEING THERE WHEN THEY DIED -- IT WAS NOT PRETTY. IT WAS NOT IT WAS NOT IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO -- AND BEFORE REALLY EVEN MEDICAL CANNABIS WAS -- SOMETHING THAT IS WAS EVEN ACCEPTED IN CALIFORNIA -- I'VE BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF MEDICAL CANNABIS INDEED WAS ONE THE FIRST THINGS I START TO WORK ON WHEN I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE -- NEARLY FIVE YEARS AGO -- MY CONCERNS WERE -- ABOUT -- THE POSSIBILITY THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD COME IN AND AND THE FACT. HOSPITAL OPERATIONS SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DO THAT -- I BELIEVE THAT -- WHILE THE AMENDMENTS ARE NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING. FOR I THINK THAT THAT IS HELPFUL BUT I WILL SAY THAT I WILL REMAIN OPEN OPEN. TO AMENDMENT SHOULD WE FIND A WAY THAT CLARIFIES TO STRENGTHEN STRENGTHEN THIS -- IN IN SOME WAY GOING FORWARD -- AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT NORMALLY WAY WE DO THAT BUT I WANT TO ASSURE YOU IF THERE'S THERE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION COMES FORWARD. I WOULD BE OPEN TO DISCUSSING THAT AS AS AS THE BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE -- IT IS -- ALMOST IT REALLY AT THIS DAY AND AGE IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE CANNOT PROVIDE THIS FOR SOMEONE IN NEED -- SO THEY CAN SPEND THE QUALITY TIME THEY DESERVE WITH THEIR FAMILY -- BEFORE -- DAY ALTERNATELY PASS AND SO -- THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS BOARD I KNOW IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT JOURNEY FOR FOR YOU -- AND AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE BILL -- AND I TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IF YOU WOULD HAVE ME -- WHEN THE BELIEVES -- WHICH I CLOSE. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THOSE OF THOSE COMMENTS AND APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT -- YOU KNOW I I I THINK ULTIMATELY. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO ARGUE WHEREVER YOU'RE YOU'RE CITY IN THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO BRING. RELIEF TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DESPERATE SUFFERING. AND I THINK THIS FOR THAT REASON THIS THIS LAW IS REVOLUTIONARY IN THE COUNTRY. AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE ON OF YOU KNOW FIGHTING THAT FIGHT THAT THIS IS REALLY INTENDED TO HELP PEOPLE. SO I APPRECIATE YOU I I THINK YOU'RE THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU HELP WITH THERE IS IT IS IT'S GOING TO BE AN ENORMOUS HELP. TO TOWARD IMPLEMENTING THE BILL MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE COOPERATION OF THE HEALTH FACILITIES THAT PROVIDE THAT ENVIRONMENT. THAT THEY ARE COOPERATIVE IN THIS PROCESS AND THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ACHIEVE. ANYTHING OTHER THAN HELPING PEOPLE. THE THE THE LAWS ARE CHANGING THE COUNTRY'S CHANGING BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBSTANCES IS CHANGING AND NOW. THERE ARE IS EVEN EVIDENCE -- SHOWING THAT IT CAN HELP. NOT ONLY RELIEVE PAIN BUT ALSO -- OF REVERSE CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND THAT THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE LEARNED THROUGHOUT TIME AS WE AS WE APPLY THIS. HAVE FOR THE BENEFIT OF PEOPLE'S HEALTH.

THEM THE MALAYSIAN RUBBER EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON SENATE BILL SIX SEVEN SEVEN AND SUGGEST AN ALTERNATIVE. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF LATEX ADVANCEMENT AND HEALTH BENEFITS WE'LL SHOW THAT THE PROHIBITION OF ALL LATEX GLOVES IS ON WARRANTED. THE PREMISE UPON WHICH THE LEGISLATION WAS FOUNDED. FOUNDED IT'S GROUNDS FOR THE PROPOSED PHASE OUT MUST BE RE EXAMINED AND UPDATED TO EXCLUDE POWDER FREE LOW PROTEIN LATEX GLOVES FROM THE PROVISION. IT IS OF UTMOST CONCERN TO PROTECT CLUB USERS AND FOOD CONSUMERS IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY. LATEX GRUBS USED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY PROTECT AGAINST THE TRANSMISSION OF CONTAMINANTS FROM BOTH USERS AND CONSUMERS. AS SHOWN BY STUDIES TIME AGAIN MODERN POWDER FREE LOW PROTEIN LATEX GLOVES PROVIDE SUPERIOR. A BARRIER PROTECTION AND HAVE A HIGH RESISTANCE TO TERRY. LATEX GLOVES CAN ALSO RESEAL AFTER A SMALL PUNCTURE UNLIKE OTHER CLUBS. THEY ARE STILL WIDELY USED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY AND IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SURGICAL AND MEDICAL PROCEDURES. LOW PROTEIN POWDER FREE LAKE SEX CLUBS ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE FDA. BY NINE AT NIGHT NOW I US BY OSHA. AND IN FACT THE THE ASTHMA AND ELDERLY FOR FOUNDATION SET FINDS THAT ONLY ABOUT 1% OF US ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THESE ALLERGIES. MOREOVER THE FDA STATED THAT THE DATA LINKING. LATEX PROTEINS AND FOODS FOR ALLERGENIC REACTION IS BASED ON ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND IS VERY WEAK. MOREOVER THERE ARE NO REPORTED DEATHS CAUSED BY LATEX PROTEIN ALLERGIES BLACK THROUGH FOOD INGESTION. FTA ALSO PERMITS LOW PROTEIN POWDER FREE GLOVES IN MEDICAL SETTINGS. THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSED PROHIBITION OF ALL LATEX GLOVES WILL OPEN THE MARKET TO THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE SYNTHETIC GLOVES. WHICH POSE HEALTH-MATTERS THEMSELVES SOME GLOVES LIKE FINAL CAN LEACH OUT HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICALS USED DURING THEIR MANUFACTURING PROJECT. PROCESS. IN SUMMARY LOW PROTEIN POWDER FREE GLOVES AT THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF BARRY PROTECTION FOR GLOVE USERS IN MEDICAL AND FOOD INDUSTRIES. AGAIN THE FDA HAS STATED THAT THE DATA LINKING LATEX PROTEINS IN FOODS TO ALLERGENIC REACTIONS IS BASED ON ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE WE HAVE PROVIDED -- THE COMMITTEE STAFF WITH UP SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD OUT LAW. HI POWDER GLOVES THE GLOVES THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM. AND PLUS THE PROBLEM IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. BUT WOULD ALLOW THE CONTINUATION OF THE GLOVES THAT ARE LOW POWERED AND HAVE HAD MUCH MORE SUCCESS. IN. PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM HAVING THE ALLERGIES. THE THE THING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANY ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NUMBER BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MISTER RODRIGUEZ. YES ON THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. FOR I TO SUFFER FROM LATEX ALLERGIES AND I KNOW THE OPPOSITION TALKED ABOUT -- NOR PERFORMS TYPE OF GLOVES TALKS ABOUT VINYL WILL WORKING THAT YOU MISS -- ARENA FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS SAYS EMT. AND POLY OVER TEN YEARS AGO THEY SWITCH FROM THE LATEX TO VINYL GLOVES. AND I FOUND THE VINYL GLOVES WERE A LOT BETTER AT PROTECTING US FROM BODY FLUIDS THAN. ON THE LATEX GLOVES. SO WITH THAT SAID -- I THINK THE LATEX GLOVES ARE BETTER AND THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THOSE FROM LATEX ALLERGIES OR SOMETHING. BENEFICIAL TO THE FOLKS OUT THERE THAT SUFFER FROM LATEX ALLERGIES BECAUSE IT IS AN ISSUE. AND I PROBABLY BIGGER THAN AND BIGGER THAN MORE REALLY THINK REALIZE OUT THERE. SO. FOR I GUESS SOME MEDICAL AGENCIES FROM PARTICULAR MY CASE EMS AGENCIES WORKING. AND USING SWITCHING THE GLOVES FROM A LATEX THE FINAL SHOULD BE TELLING US SOMETHING THAT THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE BECAUSE A LOT OF FOR FOR SPONSORS WERE EVEN HAVING THE ALLERGIES TO THE LATEX GLOVES JUST WORN FOR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. SO WHAT THAT SO LOOKING FOR TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THINKING. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. MISTER MISTER.

AND YOUR DISPATCHING AMBULANCES. WHO DO YOU TRUST? YOU TRUST PRIVATE COMPANIES AND I KNOW THERE'S OFTEN THESE KINDS OF CHALLENGES BUT THIS IS A DEEPER AND MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE OR DO YOU TRUST WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS ROOM. LITERALLY A THOUSAND YEARS OF PROFESSIONALS WITH THE FIREFIGHTERS ARE FIRE CHIEF YOU'RE GONNA HEAR TESTIFYING THESE ARE PEOPLE ON THE FRONTLINE TO MAKE THE DECISION EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WERE INFORMED THEY'RE THE ONES WHO UNDERSTAND THE RISK AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO I'M FIGHTING FOR WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL TO GIVE THEIR PROFESSIONAL. EXPERTISE VOICE IN DETERMINING HIS DISPATCHER WILL TURN THIS MATTER QUICKLY BECAUSE I RESPECT THOSE TO MOTIONS WITH MOTION SECOND. TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE OFFICIALS. THANK YOU PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN ON A REAL COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIAN RICE ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. I'M A THIRTY ONE YEAR VETERAN OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE IN SERVE BOTH ON THE FRONT LINES AND AS A DEPUTY CHIEF FOR THE SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE MOST SACRED MISSION OF GOVERNMENT AT ANYLEVEL IS PROTECTING THE LIVES AND HEALTH OF ITS PEOPLE. FOR MORE THAN SEVEN DECADES THAT MISSION HAS INCLUDED PROVIDING FAST EFFECTIVE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE RESPONSE THE FIRST AND OFTEN MOST CRITICAL LIFE AND DEATH RESPONSIBILITY IS A NINE ONE ONE DISPATCH. WHEN SECONDS COUNT IT'S A SWORN DUTY OF THE PUBLIC OF PUBLIC FIRE AGENCIES TO DEPLOY? THE CLOSEST AND FASTEST RESOURCES POSSIBLE. THEY'RE THE MOST DIRECT AND ACCOUNTABLE TO PUBLIC SAFETY PROVIDERS. SENATE BILL FOR THIRTY EIGHT INSURES THAT THIS SACRED RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT PASSED OFF. OR COMPROMISE BY MOTIVATIONS OTHER THAN WHAT MATTERS MOST IN THAT'S PATIENT CARE AND THE SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. UNDER SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT PUBLIC AGENCIES WILL BE PREVENTED FROM DIRECTLY OUTSOURCING THIS CORE PUBLIC SAFETY FUNCTION TO A PRIVATE FOR PROFIT ENTITY. THOSE AGREEMENTS THAT EXIST TODAY ARE PROTECTED BY THIS MEASURE. IN RECOGNIZING THE CORE MISSION OF PUBLIC SAFETY SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT DEMANDS THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF RESPONSE FROM PUBLIC AGENCIES WHILE ALSO REQUIRING ADHERENCE TO THE COUNTY'S MEDICAL CONTROL. AFTER ALL THE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC IN THE TAXPAYERS TO WHOM THEY SERVE. CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES MEDICAL DECISIONS ARE NOT BASED ON COST OR PROFIT. OTHER THE URGENT NEEDS OF THE PATIENT. SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT SIMPLY RECOGNIZES THAT THESE ACCOUNTABLE PUBLIC AGENCIES MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DISPATCH IN RESPONSE MODE THAT BEST PROTECTS THEIR COMMUNITIES. EVERY DISPATCH IN RESOURCE MODE MUST ALWAYS MEET OR EXCEED LAMPS -- MEDICAL CONTROL POLICIES. AS FIREFIGHTERS CMS IS PART OF OUR CORE FUNCTION YOU SIMPLY DON'T WORK AS A FIREFIGHTER IN THIS STATE IF YOU WEREN'T AT LEAST AN EMT. IN LIFE OR DEATH SITUATIONS IT'S ALL ABOUT DEPLOYING A RAPID RESPONSE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL AGENCIES FOR MAKING THAT HAPPEN SHOULD NOT BE CHECKED OFF ON ANYBODY'S BOTTOM LINE. ON BEHALF OF THE MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PROFESSIONAL. FIREFIGHTERS AND EMTS IN CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. FOUR THIRTY EIGHT A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WHAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DOCTOR DAVID VAN STRELA AND I'M A PHYSICIAN WITH FORTY SEVEN YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE IN THIS FIELD. I HAVE SERVED AS AN EMS AGENCY MEDICAL DIRECTOR AUTHORED ARTICLES AND WORKED AS A LECTURER AND EDUCATOR ON EMS RELATED ISSUES. I'M HERE AS AN EMS PROFESSIONAL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT BEEN RACED. AS MISTER RICE IS INDICATED AS THE FOUR THIRTY EIGHT WILL ENSURE THAT THE CLOSEST EMS UNITS RESPOND TO NINE ONE ONE CALLS. AS MENTIONED THE MAJOR THRUST OF THIS BILL IS TO IMPROVE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES AND QUICKLY RESPOND TO ANY PERSON CALLING. NINE ONE ONE TO PREVENT INTERFERENCE WITH A PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES AUTHORITY TO DIRECTLY RECEIVING PROCESS REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE ORIGINATING WITHIN THE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION. TO THE EMERGENCY NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. THE KEY FEATURE OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT A PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY RETAIN CONTROL OVER THE FLOW OF CONSEQUENTIAL INFORMATION PER PERSON CALLING. NINE ONE ONE THROUGH THE TEST DISPATCH CENTER TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM. THE ROLE OF INFORMATION AND MAKING SYSTEM SAFE IS PROFOUND. NOT ONLY IS INFORMATION FLOW A PRIME VARIABLE IN CREATING SAFETY. BUT IT IS ALSO AN INDICATOR OF SYSTEM FUNCTIONING. DISCUSSIONS OF MEDICAL CONTROL. I AGREE THAT PHYSICIAN OVERSIGHT AND THE DELEGATION MEDICAL SERVICES TO PARAMEDICS IS IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE ASSURED THROUGH MEDICAL CONTROL. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD RETAIN THE BENEFIT OF DECIDING THE LEVEL OF SERVICE SUITABLE TO THEIR NEEDS. THE INTEREST FROM THE COMMUNITY ARE DISTINCT FROM MEDICAL CONTROL. A WELL INTEGRATED SYSTEM COMPRISING A REQUISITE VARIETY OF ENTITIES SUPPORTS RELIABILITY SAFETY IN THE SITUATIONS WHERE THE OUT LIAR IS TO RIDLEY DISREGARDED AS RANDOM INDEPENDENT INFORMATION. SOME OUT LIARS ARE EARLY HERALDS PROCESSES THE CASCADE FAILURE AND DEATH. THE MS AGENCY PROVIDES MEDICAL CONTROL AND EFFECTIVE DELEGATION MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE SITUATIONS. PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES PROVIDE EXPERTISE IN PROTECTING CITIZENS IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY DETERMINES THE LEVEL OF SERVICE NECESSARY FOR THEIR COMMUNITY WELL BEING. THE DISPATCHERS INTEGRATED AND EMS CAN BEST SUPPORT THE MISSION WITH UNIMPEDED INFORMATION FLOW. SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT ADDRESSES SITUATIONS WHERE THE FLOOR. WITH THE FLOW OF INFORMATION TO PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES DELAYED OR WITH HELD ON THE MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT COMMUNITIES CHOSEN SERVICE LEVELS ARE MATTER OF LANCE'S. MEDICAL CONTROL WHEN A COUNTY DISPATCH SYSTEM IS NOT INTEGRATED INTO THE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES IN A SYSTEM. CONSEQUENTIAL DISPATCH INFORMATION ISN'T BEING SHARED WITH ALL UNITS FIGHTERS THE SAME TIME. HOUSING AS THE FOUR THIRTY EIGHT RECOGNIZES THE NECESSITY OF MEDICAL CONTROL. REPRESENTS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY BY HARMONIZING MEDICAL CONTROL WITH THE MISSION OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS AFTERNOON.

MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY AYE GEAR CURRY I BIGELOW. BONTA BONTA AYE BURKE. FLORA FLORA I LIVE ON MCCARTY I NAZARIAN. RAMOS RAMOS I RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO. WALDRON. WALDRON AYE. GET TEN VOTES WE HAVE FIVE MINUTE MEMBERS NOT HERE AS MORE THAN NINE REMEMBER THAT. I'M GOOD THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR TRAVEL FROM ALL OF THE CORNERS OF THE STATE WE REALLY APPRECIATED THANKS FOR GIVEN THE TIME TO ALL THE CHIEFS AND MEMBERS THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU MEMBERS OKAY [inaudible] CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION I ACTUALLY WAS GOING TO MAKE A REQUEST FOR CENTER HERTZBERG COME BACK IN PRESENT MY BILL -- THIS IS SUCH A GREAT JOB. SENATE BILL -- FOUR FIFTY TWO IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME AND I APPRECIATE THE OPTION PRESENT TODAY -- TWENTY YEARS AGO AT A IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AT AGE. THIRTY ONE I HEARD THOSE THREE WORDS THAT NOBODY EVER WANTS TO HEAR. YOU HAVE CANCER. AND I STILL REMEMBER THAT DAY AS IF IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IN THE IMPACT. THAT IT HAD ON ME PERSONALLY AND OF COURSE -- COMMUNICATING THAT TO MY WIFE I HAVING TO GO HOME. WITH A SIX MONTH OLD SON. A TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND A FOUR YEAR OLD SON AND HAVING TO COMMUNICATE. THAT I'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. YEARS LATER -- WHEN I WAS SERVING AS ANY SIMILAR MEMBER I NEED A CONSTITUENT CAME FORWARD? WITH A STORY ABOUT BEING CONTACTED BY A RESEARCHER BEFORE SHE HAD EVEN DECIDED TO TELL HER FAMILY ABOUT HER DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER -- FOR WHATEVER REASON THIS CONSTITUENT HAD DECIDED TO KEEP HER DIAGNOSIS -- PERSONAL TERCEL SHE HADN'T EVEN TOLD HER MOM -- THE SHE HAD CANCER. AND WHEN SHE WAS CONTACTED BY A RESEARCHER OUT OF THE BLUE -- SHE WAS UNDERSTANDABLY FURIOUS THAT SOMEBODY KNEW ABOUT HER DIAGNOSIS WITHOUT HER HAVING EVER SHARED. SHE HAD NO IDEA HOW THE RESEARCHER GOT HER INFORMATION BECAUSE SHE WAS UNAWARE THAT THE CANCER REGISTRY EXISTED. LET ALONE THAT IT HELD HER PERSONAL AND MEDICAL INFORMATION. I WAS SURPRISED ALSO BECAUSE AS A CANCER SURVIVOR MYSELF I WAS ALSO AWARE OF THE REGISTRIES EXISTENCE. AND THE INFORMATION THEY CONTAIN SURE ENOUGH I WROTE TO THE REGISTRY AND FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAD ALL OF MY PERSONAL INFORMATION. THINGS THAT. I SPEND TIME PROTECTING AND YOU ALSO SPEND TIME PROTECTING SUCH AS MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. CURRENT REGULATIONS REQUIRE PHYSICIANS TO MAKE PATIENTS AWARE THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. I AM NOT DENYING THAT PHYSICIANS DO THIS BUT HOW MUCH DO THEY REALLY HOW MUCH IS A PATIENT REALLY HERE -- WHEN YOU ARE TOLD YOU HAVE CANCER? I KNOW THAT I TRUST MY DOCTOR FULLY IN ASSUME THAT HE UPHOLDS ALL RULES AND LAWS HE'S REQUIRED TO AN EVEN GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND BUT I DO NOT RECALL. EVER HEARING ANYTHING ABOUT MY INFORMATION BEING SHARED WITH THE STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH FOR THE CANCER REGISTRY. UNDER CURRENT PRACTICE A PATIENT RECEIVES INFORMATIONAL BROCHURE -- WHEN A RESEARCHER MAKES INITIAL CONTACT WITH THEM? I THINK I'M I'VE GOT -- COPIES OF THE BROCHURE SO THAT WE CAN ALL I TAKE A LOOK AT IT. SO THE BROCHURE ALREADY EXISTS. I BASS THE SURGEONS THEY HAVE THEM OUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE FINDING OUT. AS A CANCER SURVIVOR. AT THE CANCER REGISTRIES EXISTENCE WHEN YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RESEARCH STUDY. YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN YOUR INFORMATION IS ENTERED. SB FOUR FIFTY TO SOLVE THIS BY SIMPLY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO SEND AN INFORMATIONAL BROCHURE TO ALL PATIENTS UPON BEING ENTERED INTO THE REGISTRY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. WITNESSES A SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO -- ONE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ESTIMATES SENATOR -- JUST RECENTLY -- I I HEARD AND BY THE WAY JUST SECONDS THIS BILL BY THE WAY -- TO ASK THIS QUESTION -- IN THERE IS ACTUALLY IN. OF THE THE RIVER THE REP REPUBLICAN ANALYSIS THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS BILL IS NECESSARY AND MAYBE IF IT'S DUPLICATIVE. HOW CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT SURE THE -- UNDER CURRENT -- PRACTICE AND LAW AS A MATTER OF FACT. WHEN YOU ARE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER -- IT IS -- REQUIRED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. TO REPORT YOUR MEDICAL A DIAGNOSIS CONDITION AND ALL YOUR CANCER INFORMATION TO THE CANCER REGISTRY. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT NOTIFY YOU ALSO THAT THIS IS HAPPENING -- SO IF IN MY PERSONAL CASE IN IN THE CASE OF THE CONSTITUENT OF BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND IT'S IN MY OWN PERSONAL POLL OF ASKING CANCER SURVIVORS MYSELF ABOUT THIS PRACTICE. I HAVE YET TO HAVE ONE CANCER SURVIVOR TELL ME. THAT THEY REMEMBER RECEIVING THE INFORMATION. ABOUT THE CANCER REGISTRY. AND I'M NOT GOING TO HEAR I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE TODAY THAT DOCTORS ARE NOT DOING THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M PROPOSING AT ALL I'M DOCTORS VERY WELL COULD BE DOING IT. BUT THAT INFORMATION DELIVERED AT SUCH A TUMULTUOUS TIME IN A CANCER. SURVIVORS LIFE THAT THEY'RE MISSING THAT INFORMATION FOR WHATEVER REASON -- SO. THE REASON THAT THIS BILL IS NOT DUPLICATE THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS. IN ADDITION TO THE PHYSICIAN BEING REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION IS ALSO REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. THE CANCER REGISTRY ITSELF -- TO LET. CANCER SURVIVORS NO WANTS THEIR INFORMATION IS ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM THAT THEY ARE IN THAT SYSTEM THE BROCHURE TALKS ABOUT THE CANCER REGISTRY ALL THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT IT DOES. AND I THINK THAT'S RECEIVED AT A MORE OPPORTUNE TIME IN A CANCER SURVIVORS LIFE WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT AND UNDERSTAND IT AND PROCESS IT ANYONE ELSE. OKAY OKAY. MY CONCERN IS IS THE CURRENT CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED ABOUT POTENTIAL DUPLICATION AND MAYBE ADDED COSTS WITHOUT A ADDED VALUE SO SO YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW AT THE EXISTING LAW REQUIRES. SHARING OF THE BROCHURE AT THAT. HOW THE EMOTIONAL MOMENT WHEN A CANCER SURVIVORS DISTRAUGHT? OF WHEN THE FIRST LEARNING ABOUT IT AND THAT'S NOT THE BEST TIME BUT YOUR BILL IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THAT WHEN THAT THEIR NAME IS ADDED TO THE REGISTRY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH NOTIFY. THE HAVE THAT RIGHT THAT IS CORRECT YES. SO WITH THE BE NOTIFIED BOTH TIMES. WELL I CAN'T -- I I I CAN'T ARGUE FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE PHYSICIANS ON WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO PRESENT THE INFORMATION. SO THIS BILL WOULD MAKE SURE. THAT TH THAT THE REGISTRY IS ACTIVE IN. PRODUCING THE BROCHURE AND MAILING IT OUT SO YOU KNOW. OR AT ONE OF THE OTHER ASPECTS OF CONFUSION ON THIS IS. WHEN YOU'RE UNDER A DOCTOR'S CARE FOR SURVIVOR? OUR OUR FOR CAN'T WHEN YOU'RE UNDER DOCTOR'S CARE FOR CANCER WHICH DOCTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR TELLING YOU IS IT YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. IS IT YOUR ONCOLOGIST IS IT YOUR SURGEON -- SO IN IN MY CASE I HAD FOUR DIFFERENT DOCTORS -- TREATING ME FOR MY CANCER AND IT'S IT'S A LEGITIMATE -- CONVERSATIONS WHICH ONE OF THOSE WAS RESPONSIBLE AND I I WOULDN'T ASTHE CANCER SURVIVOR BILL TELL YOU WHICH ONE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT. I'M JUST TELLING YOU I DON'T THINK IT DID HAPPEN AND THIS IS MAKING SURE THAT HAPPENS ANYONE ELSE -- I JUST I HAVE COMMENTS IN THE THE FIRST ONE THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR INTENT WITH THE BILL -- BUT I I BELIEVE IT'S UNNECESSARY UP. AND I WON'T BE SUPPORT I WILL BE VOTING ON THE BILL TODAY. I HAVE A NINE RECOMMENDATION. CURRENTLY AS YOU WELL AS YOU NOTED PHYSICIANS ARE REQUIRED TO SUPPLY THIS INFORMATION -- TO PATIENTS -- THE BILL THIS BILL THEN THE REQUIRES DPH TO SEND THE SAME INFORMATION. VIA MAIL LIKE OR SOME OTHER WHERE WE'RE NOT PRESCRIBING HOW THEY SEND CORRECT BUT THE REQUIRED IT TO BE SENT AGAIN AND THAT TO ME MAKES IT. COULD HAVE AND NOT A PRUDENT USE OF STATE RESOURCES WHY THANK YOU IN IT ALL BRIEFLY ADDRESS OUT OF IT IF IT'S OKAY. ONE OF THAT YOU KNOW AS SOME OF YOU THAT HAVE SERVED WITH ME IN THE ASSEMBLY RECOGNIZE IT -- WE'VE YEAH THIS IS MY FIRST RODEO WITH THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT MATTER. AND IN WORKING WITH CMA -- THEY KIND OF SHARED THOSE CONCERNS AND SO. TO WE'VE WE'VE KIND OF SIMPLIFIED THE BILL AS BEST WE CAN. IN THE CONCERNED THAT THIS CANCER SURVIVOR IS RECEIVING INFORMATION AND THAT WE ALL KNOW THE CANCER SURVIVOR IS. ACTUALLY RECEIVING INFORMATION. IN A AND APPRECIATE THAT -- AND LIKE I SAID I I WON'T BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY -- AND APPRECIATE I DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT -- AND SO ANYWAY WITH THAT.

AND CENTER PORTANTINO HERO SB SIX HUNDRED THANK YOU -- DOCTOR WOODS AND MEMBERS -- SENATE BILL LIKE IT'S SENATE BILL. SIX HUNDRED WILL MAKE CLEAR WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT STANDARD FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES. ONE MEDICALLY WHEN A MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT. MAY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY CAUSE INFERTILITY. ARE COVERED BENEFIT. BECAUSE THE LAW DOES NOT EXPLICITLY SPELL OUT EACH AND EVERY COVERED SERVICE. THERE'S CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS. MANY PATIENTS HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY DENIED COVERAGE. DESPITE THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE DMA CHEESE REPEATEDLY AND CONSISTENTLY OVERTURNING HEALTH PLAN TO NILES OF COVERAGE. FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION THESE WRONGFUL DELAYS AND THE NILES CONTINUE. TO REGULARLY -- KERR AND MULTIPLE HEALTH PLANS HAVE BLATANTLY DIFF DEFIED THE DMA CHEESE ORDER TO PAY THESE CLAIMS. COVERAGE WITH PROMPT APPROVALS FOR CARE IS CRITICAL FOR ACCESS THE RELATIVELY HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS COUPLED WITH THE SHORT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR UNDERGOING THESE PROCEDURES. BETWEEN DIAGNOSE SINCE AND CONVENTION IN. COMMENCEMENT OF TREATMENT MAKE THEM UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY PATIENTS WITHOUT AN HEALTH PLAN POTENTIAL LOSS OF PARENTHOOD IS PROFOUND CAUSING DEPRESSION A LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE AND SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN EVEN A WILLINGNESS TO OPT FOR LESS. EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OR FAILURE TO EVEN IT HERE TO TREATMENT TO TRY TO MINIMIZE LOSS OF FERTILITY. SB SIX HUNDRED IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS CAN OBTAIN FERTILITY PRESERVATION IMMEDIATELY. ENABLING THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR TREATMENT OF UNDER THEIR UNDERLYING DISEASE I WOULD SUBMIT -- THAT. INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD USE THIS SERVICE -- AND THEN DENY. GETTING TREATMENT. GET SICKER AND COST THE INSURANCE COMPANIES MORE IN THE LONG RUN WHERE IF THEY SHOULD PRESERVE THEIR FERTILITY. GOT CURED AND THEN WENT AND STARTED THEIR FAMILY IT WOULD BE A MUCH MORE SMOOTH. TRANSITION WHAT I BELIEVE LESS OUT OF POCKET HEALTH COSTS SO WITH ME TODAY I HAVE A NUMBER OF EXPERTS WHO ARE GONNA TALK YOU THROUGH WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ABOUT. THAT'S A GOOD SIGN TO OKAY AND THAT NUMBER WOULD BE TO CORRECT. YEAH THANK YOU I HAVE FOUR BUT YOU GUYS GO FIRST DOCTOR ROSEN GOES FOR OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I AM INTERESTED DIRECTOR THE FERTILITY PRESERVATION PROGRAM AT UCSF. I WORK WITH PATIENTS ON A DAILY REGULAR BASIS WHO ARE FACING TREATMENT WHICH COULD SAVE THEIR LIVES THAT THE COST OF THE PARTICULARLY. OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS I'VE SEEN THOUSANDS OF WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE DIAGNOSED WITH THE SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL CONDITION. AND THE A SIGNIFICANT REPRODUCTIVE COMPROMISE AS A RESULT OF THEIR LIFESAVING TREATMENT. WE ARE AT THIS PLACE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE INTERSECTION OF THE ADVANCES OF MEDICINE OF ONCOLOGY INFERTILITY. THE TREATMENT FOR CANCER HAS ADVANCED SO THAT IS LARGELY SUCCESSFUL. BUT THE SO QUALITY OF NOT REPRODUCING AS A RESULT OF THE TREATMENT A DEVASTATING. THE TECHNOLOGY FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS ADVANCED SO MUCH THAT IS NOW BEING USED ROUTINELY FOR WOMEN WHO WANT TO DELAY FAMILY BUILDING. CURRENTLY THE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE URGENT NEEDS OF THESE CANCER PATIENTS DUE TO THE LACK OF CLARIFICATION OF THE EXISTING COVERAGE OF CODE IN CODE. IN WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS MUST DECIDE IN THE COURSE OF CARE AND ACT QUICKLY. THE INSURANCE COVERAGE MUST BE CLEARLY STATED EASILY ACCESSED HOWEVER THIS IS OFTEN NOT THE CASE. THIS IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT NOT ALL SERVICES ARE LISTED IN THE EVIDENCE. OF COVERAGE BUT INFERTILITY OFTEN IS LISTED TYPICALLY AS A NON COVERED SERVICE. THE CONFUSION BETWEEN FERTILITY PRESERVATION INFERTILITY IS RAMPANT AND ADDS TO THE DELAYS IF NOT IF NOT OUTRIGHT DENIALS SIMPLY SPECIFICALLY LISTING FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS A COVERED BENEFIT WOULD LESSEN THE CONFUSION. THE CONFUSION LEADS TO DELAYS WHICH FOR MANY OF THESE WOMEN IS EQUIPMENT TO THE NILE TO THE NARROW WINDOW OF WHEN THEY CAN ACCESS THE SERVICE. IN LIGHT OF THE CANCER TREATMENT AS A RESULT FEWER WOMEN ARE ABLE TO CURRENTLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF USING FERTILITY PRESERVATION TRADE. SO WHY IS THIS ACCESO CRITICAL. THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT ONE THIRD OF WOMEN. ARE ONE THIRD OF PATIENTS POTENTIALLY HAVE THE FERTILITY DECISIONS INFLUENCE THEIR TREATMENT DECISIONS WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE COVERAGE FOR TO LEE PRESERVATION FOR GOING RECOMMENDED TREATMENT. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE PATIENTS WITHOUT THE OPTION FERTILITY PRESERVATION SCORE WORSE ON MEASURES OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND SATISFACTION WITH LIFE. WE ARE SEEING THAT THE LACK OF COVERAGE COULD EVEN IMPACT THEIR CHANCE OF SURVIVING THEIR CANCER. IN CONCLUSION CLARIFICATION THE EXISTING COVERAGE FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION WOULD PROVIDE A BETTER CARE. GIVING A PERSON BOTH THEIR LIFE. AND THEIR DREAM OF A BIOLOGIC FAMILY. THANK YOU AND I BEHALF OF UCSF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE. MY PATIENCE AND MYSELF I ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOULD AN HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF SENATE BILL. SIX HUNDRED MY NAME IS JOYCE REINECKE AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION CALLED THE ALLIANCE FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION. BUT I AM ALSO A CANCER SURVIVOR AND I HAD TO GO THROUGH FERTILITY PRESERVATION TO HAVE MY OWN CHILDREN. THROUGH MY WORK OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS I'VE MET HUNDREDS OF CANCER PATIENTS SURVIVORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND I'VE HEARD THEIR FEARS ABOUT THEIR CANCER. BUT ALSO ABOUT THEIR CHANCE OF HAVING CHILDREN. YEARS AGO OPTIONS FOR THESE PATIENTS WERE LIMITED. AND THERE REALLY WASN'T A DISCUSSION ABOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE. BUT AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD THE TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED SIGNIFICANTLY AND IS NOW CONSIDERED STANDARD BY ALL OF THE RELEVANT -- CANCER AND REPRODUCTIVE SOCIETIES. INSURERS BY AND LARGE HOWEVER HAVE NOT UPDATED THEIR COVERAGES TO REFLECT THIS REALITY. THEY HAVE AVOIDED COVERING FERTILITY PRESERVATION BY CONTINUING TO LOOK AT IT AS A TYPE OF INFERTILITY TREATMENT. AND THEREFORE ELECTIVE AN EXCLUDED. BUT I WOULD PUT TO YOU THAT THE LOSS OF FERTILITY IS NOT MERELY A MEDICAL COMPLICATION. THIS AFFECTS REPRODUCTION AND EFFECTS PARENTHOOD WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTAL LIFE FUNCTIONS. AND THAT DESERVE THE HIGHEST ORDER PROTECTION. BUT AT A MINIMUM WE ASK THAT AT LEAST THESE SERVICES BE TREATED THE SAME WAY AS OTHER MEDICAL SIDE EFFECTS THAT ARE ENCOUNTERED IN CANCER TREATMENT. SUCH AS ANTI NAUSEA MEDICATIONS PROSTHETICS AND BREAST RECONSTRUCTION THESE ARE SEEN AS INTEGRAL TO CANCER CARE AND AS A RESULT THEY ARE COVERED. THANKFULLY STATES AND BODIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE INCREASINGLY ADOPTED THIS VIEW. AND IN THE LAST TWO YEARS SIX STATES AND THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION HAVE ENACTED THIS COVERAGE. AND THERE ADDITIONAL BILLS THAT ARE PENDING RIGHT NOW. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE HAS ALREADY RECOGNIZED INSURERS LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THIS COVERAGE FOR THESE PATIENTS. THIS BUTTE CAME ABOUT AFTER A DELIBERATE EFFORT THAT WE WERE INVOLVED IN TO HELP CANCER PATIENTS CHALLENGE DENIALS OF COVERAGE. THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEWS IN ALL OF THESE CASES HAVE CONSISTENTLY FOUND THAT IN THE FACE OF POTENTIALLY STERILIZING CANCER TREATMENT. FERTILITY PRESERVATION WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED. THEY HAVE UNIFORMLY OVERTURN THE INSURERS TO NILES. THESE HAVE BEEN GREAT OUTCOMES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WHO WERE INVOLVED BUT THIS IS NOT A VIABLE PATH FOR COVERAGE FOR THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS. THEY'RE IN THE MIDST OF A LIFE ALTERING MEDICAL CRISIS A DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER. AND THEY CANNOT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO UNDERTAKE A TIME CONSUMING FINANCIALLY RISKY APPEAL PROCESS. ESPECIALLY FOR COVERAGE THAT THE T. MHC HAS RECOGNIZED THEY ALREADY HAVE. THESE KINDS OF DELAYS WHETHER THEY'RE DELIBERATE OR WHETHER THEY ARE INADVERTENT HAVE THE SAME AFFECT ON THE PATIENT. THE DISPUTES BECOME TO NILES ONCE SOMEONE IS LEFT IN BERLIN STARTED TREATMENT. NO FAVORABLE I AM MARK IN REVERSE THIS DAMAGE SO THE CLARITY OF COVERAGE IS ESSENTIAL. FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU PASS THIS MEASURE THANK. THEY'RE HERE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. BRENT SPENCE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OBGYN IS TO SHIP NINE AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. ALTAMONTE IN SMITH WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SO MY AND HER ON BEHALF OF SUSAN G. KOMEN ALSO IN SUPPORT. IT'S OR ANYONE ELSE OUT IS ABOUT A CO SPONSOR THIS MEASURE WITH AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE OPPOSITION. QUESTION SIDE OVER. ONE THE OPPOSITION HAS REPLACED SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF ETHNIC LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS. OR CAP CAP IS TAKING AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB -- SIX HUNDRED WHICH IS A NEW MANDATE THAT RETRO ACTIVELY REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO COVER FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES. WE OPPOSE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM -- FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. THE MANDATE EXCEEDS THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS PACKAGE AS ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION IN. TWENTY TWELVE IN ITS CURRENT FORM. SB SIX HUNDRED CONTAINS UNPRECEDENTED RETROACTIVITY LANGUAGE STATING THE LEGISLATION IS DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS NOT A COVERED BENEFIT UNDER EXISTING LAW. THE RETROACTIVITY LANGUAGE IN OUR VIEW CREATES A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. SUCH RETROACTIVITY CREATES UNACCEPTABLE IN A NOBLE UNKNOWABLE LIABILITY FOR PLANS WHICH FOR YEARS EXCLUDED THIS COVERAGE WITH THE PERMISSION IN THE APPROVAL OF STATE REGULATORS. THE RISK IN A LIABILITY FOR HEALTH PLANS AND BY EXTENSION THEIR ENROLLEES FROM IMPOSING RETROACTIVITY ARE UNKNOWN BUT LIKELY SUBSTANTIAL. THIS PROVISION OF THE BILL MUST BE REMOVED. THERE IS A LONG STANDING HISTORY ON FERTILITY PRESERVATION -- WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY SEVENTEEN YEARS OF ACTION TAKEN BY STATE REGULATORS -- THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH -- THESE -- ACTIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. THE LEGISLATURE INTHE ADMINISTRATION ADOPTING AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS PACKAGE THROUGH THE SELECTION OF A BENCHMARK PLAN THAT DID NOT INCLUDE COVERAGE FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES. PRIOR BILLS ATTEMPTING TO ADD FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES AS A COVERED BENEFIT FAILED TO PASS IN TWO OCCASIONS. AND A STRONG VETO MESSAGE BY GOVERNOR BROWN ON A THIRD BILL. EIGHTY NINE TWELVE CLEARLY STATED THAT FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT QUOTE. WELL I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO PRESERVE FERTILITY WHERE POSSIBLE SUCH COVERAGE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED JUST LAST YEAR. FOR INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP COVERAGE. THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE OF FOR YEARS APPROVED HEALTH PLAN EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE DOCUMENT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS A COVERED BENEFIT. THE ALSO APPROVED COVERAGE WRITERS FOR THIS SERVICE. FURTHER UNDERLYING THAT FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS NOT REQUIRED SERVICE BUT AN OPTIONAL. ONE NEITHER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES NOR CITY I HAVE ISSUED ANY REGULATIONS NOR DO THEY HAVE THAT AUTHORITY IN OUR VIEW -- THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS A DISCREPANCY REGARDING FERTILITY PRESERVATION AS A COVERED BENEFIT. THE TEAMMATE SEE BELIEVES IT IS A BENEFIT. AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE DID NOT FURTHERMORE WE RECEIVE COMMUNICATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CLARIFYING THAT THE MEDICAL PROGRAM DOES NOT CURRENTLY COVER THE SERVICE. THE ISSUE HERE IS NOT THE SERVICE ITSELF BUT RATHER THE UNPRECEDENTED PROCESS BY WHICH THE MANDATE IS BEING PLACED IN THE LAW RETROACTIVELY. RETROACTIVELY ESTABLISHING BENEFITS DIMINISH HIS OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN ESTABLISHING BENEFITS WHICH IS THE POWER IMPROPERLY REVIEWING THEIR COST. HOWEVER IN THIS CASE IF THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS TO PROSPECTIVELY ESTABLISH FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES THAT'S A COVERED BENEFIT. OUTSIDE OF THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS PROCESS THE BILL MUST BE NARROWED IN CLARIFIED TO A PUT SOME PARAMETERS AROUND THIS NEW COVERAGE BENEFITS. IF THE RETROACTIVITY LANGUAGES REMOVED WE ARE WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS TO DISCUSS THE PARAMETERS AROUND THIS COVERAGE PROSPECTIVELY -- I WOULD JUST FROM AND WE SUPPLIED AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST FINALLY SAY MEMBERS -- COVER CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT -- PREMIUMS IN TWENTY TWENTY YOU'RE GOING UP BY LESS THAN 1% IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. THIS IS REMARKABLE PROGRESS AND THAT'S A RESULT OF A CONSCIOUS MARTIN TOUGH POLICY DECISIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS TO STABILIZE THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. PASSING NEW AND EXPENSIVE BENEFIT MANDATES PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT -- HAVE A OF A FALSE DECLARATORY EXISTING LAW COMPONENTS -- THREATEN TO WIPE% OUT THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE THEREFORE WE OPPOSE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM THANK YOU. ANYONE CAN TELL ME HAVE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIKE LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- POSITION WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RETROACTIVE PIECE THEY WON'T BELABOR MANY OF THE ISSUES WE ARE OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING. AND PROVIDERS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO PROVIDE SERVICES BUT WE DO THINK THAT IS THE LEGISLATORS. RIGHT RESPONSIBILITY TO PASS -- MANDATES GOING FORWARD ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS AND THE CONCEPT OF PUTTING IN PLACE A RETROACTIVE NATURE ESPECIALLY TO THE DEGREE. THAT IT IGNORES THE FACT THAT THE INSURANCE -- COMMISSIONER IS INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED AND HAS A DIFFERENT ROBUST BODY OF LAW THAT COVERS THE PRODUCTS UNDER CDI WHICH IS A DIFFERENT -- VIEWPOINT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A COVERED BENEFIT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR IF THERE IS AN ABILITY -- TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD AND POTENTIALLY AMEND THE BILL TO TAKE OUT THE RIGHT TRACK TO PEACE. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. HELLO. JOHN WE GOT WE HAVE AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS ALSO POSE LIST AMENDED. THANK YOU. KAREN CIRCUIT SCENE WITH CAL CHAMBER WHERE POST AS WELL THANK YOU. OKAY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THIS TO ME. SENATOR THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS FOR TO KNOW THAT -- YOU FOR DONE SOME WORK ALSO LOOKING NOTICING THAT YOU'RE QUITE A BIT SUPPORT OVER -- OVER IN THE SENATE -- BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THAT -- THE QUESTION ABOUT THIS SORT OF RETRO ACTIVE VERSUS PERSPECTIVE -- I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD SUPPORT ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT -- THIS IDEA OF OF THAT LANGUAGE ABOUT -- DEVELOPING RETROACTIVE IN THE MAYBE EVEN SOME -- LEGAL LIABILITY THAT MIGHT THAT BE DRAWN FROM NEXT SO CAN YOU DRESS THEM. YEAH THE SECOND PART I THINK IS THE EASIEST PART I DON'T THINK THERE'S LEGAL LIABILITY -- YOU KNOW OUR OUR ANALYSIS OUR POINT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE THAT PEACE IS BEING. DISCUSSED IS WHY WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR OF WHAT THE CURRENT LAW -- IS SAYING AND WHY WERE RE STATING THAT CURRENT LAW. THE OTHER PIECE WHICH IS NOT FOR YOUR QUESTION BUT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE I BROUGHT ALL THE HEALTH PLANS INTO MY OFFICE AND I SAID I DON'T WANT TO DO A BILL. JUST SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND I SAID TAKE A YEAR. YOU KNOW TO FIND YOUR BENEFIT. YOU KNOW THIS IS WHEN THE ORIGINAL MANDATES WERE CREATED. THE ADVANCES IN FERTILITY PRESERVATION DIDN'T EXIST AND I SAID NOW THAT THEY'RE THERE GO AHEAD AND DO IT. SO IT WAS WITH RELUCTANCE THAT I WENT INTO THIS BUT NOW THAT IT'S BEEN A DECADE LATER. EACH STEP OF THE WAY WE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING THE SUPPORT THAT I THOUGHT. PEOPLE WOULD EMBRACE GIVEN THE ADVANCES OF OF TECHNOLOGY AND WHERE FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS TODAY THE OTHER PART OF THE RETROACTIVITY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE AFFECTED. WOULD BE A VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNT WE KNOW THAT NUMBER WHAT'S THAT THE NUMBER YOU GUYS WANT. TO WHO WANTS TO JUMP IN ON SORRY I'VE YOU MEAN THE NUMBER PER YEAR THAT WOULD BE DIAGNOSED IN NO NO THOSE THING BECAUSE BY NOW IT WOULD BE IF IT'S RETROACTIVE THOSE THAT WOULD WOULD HAVE WOULD BE USING THIS -- THAT WAS RETRACTED FROM THEIR DIAGNOSIS NOT RETROACTIVE FROM A CALENDAR PROJECT RIGHT RIGHT -- BASED ON CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WERE PART OF LAST WEEK WITH THE D. MHC I KNOW THAT THEY SAID THAT THERE ARE EXISTING ROLES WITHIN THE PLANS ABOUT -- YOU KNOW KIND OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS AS TO WHEN SOMEONECAN BRING A CLAIM AND THAT'S ALREADY YOU'RE NOT CHANGING THOSE PIECES WE'RE JUST MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO. ARE WARRANTED COVERAGE GET IT IF IT WAS MESSED WITHIN. THAT TIME FRAME NOT GOING BACK FIVE YEARS AND SAYING YOU WERE SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS TIME IT'S WITHIN THE TIME FRAME OF THEIR DIAGNOSIS. MAKING SURE THAT IT IT'S COVERED AND CLARIFYING THE LAW TO DO THAT. SO IT MIGHT HAVE WITH THE FACT THAT THE OPPOSITION CAN ONE AND TALK ABOUT THAT IN REGARDS TO THE SHE WANTS TO JUMP IN IF I'M SURE THAT GARY -- FROM OUR CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW STATING THAT SOMETHING IS RETROACTIVE IS SIMPLY. AN ACCURATE CHARACTERIZATION. THIS BILL SEEKS TO STATE THAT IT'S SIMPLY DECLARATORY EXISTING LAW THEREFORE THERE CAN BE NO RETROACTIVITY LEGALLY SPEAKING AND MY CALL YOUR CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT BUT BUT IF I CAN IF IT'S DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW THEN WHAT WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF OF OF THE BILL. BECAUSE THEY'RE DENYING THAT WE COVERAGE UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE'S FORCING THESE APPEALS AND EVERY APPEAL HAS BEEN OVERTURNED. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. THEY'RE SAYING IN THEIR ARGUMENTS THAT THE LAW IS IN CLEAR. AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAW IS CLEAR EVERYONE OF THE APPEALS HAS BEEN OVERTURNED BUT WHAT I THINK I HEARD IS THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE EXISTING LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE -- THIS AND SO IF IT YEAH GOD SO IF I MAY UM THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE ISSUED A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER A FEW MONTHS AGO -- AND TO THE SPECIFICALLY STATED ALL OF THE ABOVE FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES REQUIRE CONSULTATIONS OUTPATIENT SURGICAL PROCEDURES AND PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE. SERVICES ALL OF WHICH ARE DEFINED AS A BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICE UNDER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE MORE OVER IF WE LOOK AT THE TO BURKE ANALYSIS -- YOU KNOW SPEAKING TO THE FACT THAT IT EXCEEDS THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS CLEAN. STATES SB SIX HUNDRED IS UNLIKELY TO EXCEED THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS DIEM ACTUALLY CONFIRMED TO TO BURKE THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW. FERTILITY PRESERVATION TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL IOTA JANET INFERTILITY EASY BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE ONE MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THE AND REALLY ISN'T IN OPPOSITION TO DRESS THAT. YET SO -- WELL SEVERAL THINGS WERE -- INCLUDED AS A PART THAT WE WE WHICH SPECIFIC COMPONENT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ADDRESS WHAT IS IT THAT YOU THAT'S THE DESPITE THIS BUT I MEAN. WHAT WHAT SHE HAD JUST REFERRED TO HAVE THIS IDEA FOR IF IT WERE SAYING THAT IT'S THAT IF IT IS THE EXISTING LAW? YEAH NO THE EGGS EXISTING LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE FERTILITY PRESERVATION TO BE COVERED -- I WE THINK IT'S WE THINK IT'S PRETTY QUICK CLEAR -- THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION PICKED AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS PACKAGE THEY PICKED. AN EXISTING PRODUCT THATWAS ON THE MARKET TO SERVE AS THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT PRODUCT DID NOT -- INCLUDE COVERAGE. FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION AND THIS CONCEPT THAT THIS IS A BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICE -- WE THINK -- IS A FAULTY ARGUMENT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO DEFINE. THE BENEFITS AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE TO BE COVERED BY HEALTH PLANS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT LACKS THE POWER TO UNILATERALLY EXPAND THOSE BENEFITS AND SERVICES -- THE DECISION TO WHAT CONSTITUTES A A A SERVICE IS A POLICY DECISION THAT IN OUR VIEW IS SOLELY IN THE HANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO AND SO I'M I'M HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO WONDERING IF. IF THE LEADS SO IN REGARDS TO TO SAYING THAT THAT THE LAW ALREADY EXISTED THIS SHOULD BE A COVERED BENEFIT. THE DA POSITION IS SAYING NO THE BILL SAYING YES IT IS -- SO IS THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE PROPER PLACE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION OR THE COURTS THE PROPER PLACE TO BE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION BECAUSE IF IN THE PAST YOU GUYS OF SAID NO IT'S NOT A COVERED BENEFIT THERE'S A NO ACTUALLY IS A COVERED. BENEFIT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CRUX OF THE PART OF THE PROBLEM. RIGHT SO IF WE WE'VE OFFERED AMENDMENTS WE ARE WILLING TO ENTER INTO A DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR. TO WORK ON THIS BILL IF THE RETROACTIVITYPEACE IS REMOVED SO THAT WE CAN PROSPECTIVELY ESTABLISH COVERAGE FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES SO IF I CAN JUST FOR SECOND THINKING NOUN SO THAT STATE. SENATOR PORTANTINO FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN DID YOU CITIES FIRST ARE WORKING ON THE 600-010-22000 AND TEN IN CENTER PORTANTINO BUT THE TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER PORTANTINO -- I BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS -- SOMETHING THAT WAS COVERED AND THAT -- AND SO. AT WHAT POINT DO WE DECIDED THIS IS A COVERED BENEFIT ONE IT SOUNDS LIKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS A COVER BENEFIT NOT NOW WE'RE SAYING IT'S NOT. THERE'S GOT A BILL TO SAY NO IT WAS A COVERED BENEFIT HAS BEEN A COVER BENEFIT ALL ALONG -- OKAY SO. WHAT WHY NOT SAY SO SO WHY NOT SAID TODAY THAT IT IS AND -- WHAT WE? SO WHAT WHAT WHERE YOU OPPOSED TO THE THE IF THE IF THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T DECIDE IS A COVERED BENEFIT ANIMAL SUPPORT AMONGST THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS HOUSE -- BUT TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IT IS A COVERED BENEFIT ONE WITH THAT DATE START WHEN WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE THAT DATE STARTING. RIGHT SO AT THE YOU KNOW WHEN SO WE HAVE LANGUAGE IN THAT ARE AMENDMENTS. AND I'LL HAVE TO BREAK THOSE OUT. IN ORDER TO GET THE EXACT DATE BUT TYPICALLY IT WOULD BE -- UPON RENEWAL THE NEXT POLICY OR OR THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO DID THE START DATE WOULD BE -- YOU KNOW THE FIRST OF THE YEAR WHO'D BE YOU KNOW ONCE POLICIES ARE RENEWED UPON AFTER THAT UPON AFTER THAT. IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR. YEAH YOU HAVE TO TELL ON THE HEAD I MEAN WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE'RE SQUABBLING ABOUT EXISTING LAW. AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THIS BILL AND THE POINT THAT THE A LEGISLATURE'S APPROPRIATE PLACE TO DRAW THE LINE. I'M ASKING. THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE TO HELP ME DRAW THE LINE AS THE LEGISLATURE. WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO HELP TO DRAW THAT LINE IT WE JUST DON'T WANT TO GO BACK IN TIME BECAUSE IT OPENS OUR FIRST OF ALL IT'S WRONG ON THE LAW. IN NUMBER TWO WOULD EXPOSE OUR PLAN. TO PLANS. TO UNKNOWN IN UNTOLD LIABILITIES FOR THOSE WHO FEEL LIKE IT WAS EXISTING LAW AND NOW WE HAVE A LAW DECLARING THAT ITS EXISTING LAW WHEN IT'S NOT -- AND SO THAT'S AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE LANGUAGE SAYS IT SAYS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A CHANGE ALONG. THEN WHY HAVE THE BILL. BUT BUT IF IT ISN'T AS IF IT IS AN EXISTING LAW. THEN YOU COULD GO TO THE COURT INSTANT THE COURT COULD SAY NO IT WASN'T EXISTING LAW. RIGHT. SURE THAT'S THAT'S A POSSIBILITY SO JUST BY SAYING TODAY THAT ITS EXISTING LOT WITH THAT WELL WHY WOULD I MEAN WE WE WE WANT TO TRY WILL [inaudible] YEAH. IF I MAYES. YEAH ONE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS BY THE WAY IT'S HARD NOT YOU'RE DOING YEAH. USING ONE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT DECLARATION THAT IT IS EXISTING LAW IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THESE -- BAIT AND STATUTORY TIMELINES WHERE BY -- ENROLLEES HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO FILE A GRIEVANCE WITH THEIR HEALTH PLAN AND THEY HAVE SIX MONTHS TO FILE FOR AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW WITH THE DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE. SO BY DECLARING THAT THIS IS EXISTING LAW -- WERE SAYING THAT THOSE TIME LINES HAVE ALREADY RUN BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW PRE DATED THIS NEW THAT SEES ME THIS BILL -- SO IMAGINE THEN WITH OUT THIS APPEARS IF YOU DON'T SAY THAT THIS IS EXISTING LAW AND THE IMPLICATION IS THAT YOU WERE CHANGING THE LAW WHEREBY YOU RESTART THESE TIME LINES AND YOU OPEN THE GATES TO SAY WELL. NOW YOU HAVE SIX MONTHS TO SUBMIT AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW OR YOU HAVE -- HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS THIS MAN GROUP MISTER HEALTH PLAN. I'M STILL CONFUSED MISTER CHAIR MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE CAN HELP ME OUT [inaudible] MISS BURKE. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M SORRY I THOUGHT I AM SO SORRY I JUST SOMEONE ELSE. I I I I JUST RAMOS AND GO AHEAD OF I MEAN TO BE SUPER QUICK I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE'RE HERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT EXISTING LAWS BUT THE COURTS HAS UP HOLDING YOUR INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE LAW IS. NINE I I'M ASKING SENATOR NO IT HASN'T GONE IT HAS TO BE AN EDUCATED IN THE COURTS SO WHY DO YOU ENVISION AS WE USED TO DO. IT OKAY IS A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER ISSUED BY THE DEMON SHE TO A SPECIFIC HEALTH. HM AC SAYS THAT YES YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IT'S CORRECT RIGHT THERE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW THAT WERE ADELINE IT'S THEIR INTERPRETATION A LOT OKAY. SO NOW MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT CLEAN SO IT'S FROM THE TIME SO I'M TRYING TO GO BACK TO THE RETROACTIVITY SO. FROM THE TIME THERE'S A DIAGNOSIS HOW LONG DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DO THEIR PRESERVATION. OUT OF THE IT IN GENERAL IT DEPENDS IT'S A GOOD QUESTION BUT I WOULD SAY ROUGHLY THEY HAVE ABOUT. MEN LET'S SAY LESS THAN A WEEK WOULD BE VERY CONSERVATIVE -- TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION. BECAUSE THE CANCER TREATMENT IS. OF THE IMMEDIATE NATURE. SO IN THAT TREATMENT IN GENERAL TAKES A COUPLE WEEKS SO THE SOONER THEY START. THEN THE LAST DELAYS THERE ARE IN THEIR TREATMENT. BECAUSE THE DELAYS COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE OTHER PETS FOR COMPROMISE RIGHT SO IT'S AN IMMEDIATE DECISION RIGHT AND SO WHEN YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT RETROACTIVITY THE THE INSURANCE PLANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING SUED BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND. THE THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS -- AND AND AND THAT'S ACOSTA CAN'T BE QUANTIFIED. PLANS DID NOT BUILD THIS INTO THEIR RATES. SO -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT A COVERED SERVICE AND NOT ONLY IS IT NOT A COVERED SERVICE -- IT WAS -- IT WAS IT WAS APPROVED AS AN ON COVERED SERVICE BY THE REGULATOR SO WE WILL. WE ARE TOLD WAS OKAY NOT TO COVER. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT THE AND EVERY APPEAL HAS BEEN GRANTED RIGHT SO THE I MEAN AND NOT SO SO EVERY SO EVERY DECISION IS KIND OF CODIFIED THAT THIS IS PROBABLY IS. IN THEIR INTERPRETATION YEAH KEEPING YOUR EYES IN YOUR THEIR INTERPRETATION THAT THIS IS WHAT THE LAW MEANT -- AND SO WHAT AT WHAT LEVEL LIKE SENATOR DO YOU THINK WHEN THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT AT A LAWSUIT WHAT LEVELS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AND FOR HOW LONG IS THIS ALL THE WAY BACK FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN YOUR ESTIMATION THAT THEY WOULD. PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT. TO NO BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF RETROACTIVITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE RETROACTIVITY OF SERVICE WE'RE NOT OPENING UP THE RETROACTIVITY FOR LIABILITY OKAY SO THAT THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE KEY TO AND THAT WE THINK THE LIABILITY ISSUE REALLY JUST A RED HERRING. TO FIND SOMETHING THAT MIGHT MAKE LEGISLATORS CONCERNED I AM THAT'S MY INTERPRETATION GOT IT THANK YOU. RAMOS THANK YOU IN -- CENTER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD -- MY QUESTIONS ALSO -- ARE CENTERED AROUND THE RETRO ACTIVITY AND TRYING TO GET A A TIME FRAME FROM READING THE BILL THERE'S DIFFERENT DATES THAT ARE IN THERE. ONE IS JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO ARE WE TALKING RETRO ACTIVE TO THAT DATE AS FAR AS EXISTING LAWN THIS BILL WOULD STATE THAT THESE PROVISIONS ARE DEFINITE TORY OF THE EXISTING LAW. TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THEN WE HAVE THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE BILL. ON PAGE FIVE SECTION FOR THE COULD BE -- CONSTRUED AS GOING AS FAR BACK AS AS TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME LOOKING FOR SOME CLARITY. ON THAT -- IT IF THERE HAS BEEN ONGOING DISCUSSION ON THAT ARE PERHAPS IF THERE IS GOING TO BE ON GOING DISCUSSION ON THESE COMPONENTS. THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE ONGOING DISCUSSION I MEAN IN OUR ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE MHC WANTS WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS WITH. THE THE CARE GRABBERS OF HOW TO APPROACH THIS TO PROVIDE THE CARE WE THINK THIS CLARITY OF LANGUAGE. DOES ALL OF THOSE THINGS I MEAN I'M I'M I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT. IF THAT. RETROACTIVITY PIECE AYE AYE. FRANKLY I THINK IT'S A RED HERRING BUT I'M I'M OPEN TO SITTING DOWN WITH FOLKS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT AND BRING THE EMAIL THE MHC IN THE ROOM. I I I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS WHAT THE MHC -- THIS IS THE ROUTE DIRECTION THAT THE CLARITY IS IS WARRANTED BUT I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. SO ARE THE DATES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER SECTION AS FAR AS THE RETROACTIVITY -- ON PAGE WHAT PAGE AND FOR WHAT PATRON SO ON PAGE -- ONE DEALS WITH -- JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO INCLUDE AT A MINIMUM COVERAGE OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS INCLUDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES AS THE FINE. THEN THE NEXT SECTION THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY. RIGHT THAT INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP HEALTH CARE SIR THAT'S THE EXISTING LAW SO THIS IDEA ALONG WITH THAT RETROACTIVITY FROM EXISTING LAW ONCE IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD BUT THAT THE YOU DIGEST YOUR READING IS THE EXISTING LAW WE'RE NOT. CHANGING IT SAYS UNDER IN THAT NEXT SESSION THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY AND THEN THAT'S OR TALK ABOUT NOW RIGHT WOULD MAKE THE EXISTING LAW THAT THEN WOULD CLARIFY WHAT THE LAW WAS IN JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO WE TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO THAT DATE OR ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT. GOING AS FAR BACK AS TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE I THINK QUIRK CLARIFYING IT FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT'S SO ANY ANY TALK OF RETROACTIVITY WOULD ONLY GO BACK AT THIS POINT. TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I BELIEVE THAT IS CORRECT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THESE ISSUES UP AND I THINK IT DOES -- AT LEAST FOR ME -- FURTHER DISCUSSION MAYBE WE CAN MEET WITH YOUR OFFICE AND AND OTHERS TO TRY TO CLARIFY THAT COMPONENT ABSENT FROM YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT WERE CENTERED AROUND AS FAR AS A RETRO. ACTIVELY GOING BACK. TO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WERE. AGREED. TO THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT PERCEPTION OF THAT [inaudible] SENATOR. STRUGGLING MADDOX PLAYING THIS. THE STANDARD OF CARE BECAME EFFECTIVEIN TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN RIGHT THAT'S WHEN THE STANDARD OF CARE WAS CREATED. WE'RE NOT GOING BACK IN TIME AND SAYING. THAT WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT THE TIMELINE THAT WAS IN EXISTING LAW IS THE TIMELINE. THE RETROACTIVITY PART IS ON THE TREATMENT PART. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEBODY TODAY. WAS DIAGNOSED AND THIS LAW WERE TO COME INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY. THAT PERSON WHO STILL ELIGIBLE WHO HASN'T BECOME INFERTILE. HAS THIS RETROACTIVE. ABILITY TO GET. FERTILITY PRESERVATION. SO IF SOMEBODY WAS TEN YEARS AGO. WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THEY'RE LIABLE FOR NOT GETTING IT BUT IF THERE'S SOMEBODY IN THIS WINDOW BEFORE THE LAW BECOMES. EFFECTIVE. THEY'D BE ENTITLED TO THAT TREATMENT. WHAT IS IT THAT THE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE RETROACTIVITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THAT'S THE QUESTION OF WHAT WHAT TIME ARE WE FOLLOWING BUT THE MEDICAL? TREATMENT DEFINES THAT I MEAN IF UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS IS WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY IF SOMEBODY HAD CHEMO LAST YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY THERE NOW. MOST LIKELY INFERTILE. SO THEY COULDN'T GET. THE FERTILITY PRESERVATION. BUT IF SOMEBODY WERE TO BE DIAGNOSED TOMORROW. AND FOR DIDN'T WANT TO GET TREATED UNTIL JANUARY WHEN THIS BECOMES LAW. THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED FOR THAT. TAKE A STATE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT INFERTILE RIGHT NOW. IT WHEN WE LOOK FORWARD TO TO DISCUSS ANY OF THEM IS THAT RIGHT. I THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR HAVE IT ALL OF THAT'S MY CLOTHES THANK. WE'RE NOT DONE I KNOW WE HAVE. YEAH [inaudible] MISTER RODRIGUEZ. AND NOT JUST CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION OF RETROACTIVITY BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE A BIG ISSUE THE ROUND UP ON IF THIS BILL GOES OUT OUR HOPE -- CENTER YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING OPPOSITION -- CLARIFY THAT AND MAKE IT BETTER WHERE WE CAN MORE UNDERSTAND AND WORK WITH THAT SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WORK THEM ON IT FOR BILL GETS OUT THANKS ANYONE ELSE. THANK YOU I THINK I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON ON SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN THE LAST YEAR. YEAH I MEAN SO I ITEMS TO READ FROM THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK -- IT'S PRETTY CLEAR -- VIEW DITION OF THIS SECTION -- TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ME INSURANCE CODE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A CHANGING BUT IS DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW THERE NO PARAMETERS AROUND. I'M IN EVEN IF THEY WERE WE WOULD STILL OPPOSE THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT BENEFIT MANDATES CAN BE MADE RETROACTIVE. BECAUSE THE STANDARD OF CARE THAT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER IS THE STANDARD OF CARE CHANGE THAT WAS MADE UNILATERALLY BY THE STATE REGULATOR IN THE STATE REGULATOR CAN NOT RIGHT THE LAW. WE THE PLAN THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THAT SEASON DESIST ORDERS CHALLENGING THAT CEASE DESIST ORDER. AND YOU KNOW -- THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS HAS ACTUALLY FILED A WRIT OF PETITIONS SUPERIOR COURTS -- TO ORDER THE DO YOU NEED TO SEE FROM EXERCISING ITS POWERS UNDER THE KNOX KEEN ACT. OF FROM EXCEEDING I SHOULD SAY SORRY EXCEEDING ITS POWERS UNDER THE KNOX KEEN ACT -- THE RATE IS NOT A A REFLECTION OF THE SERVICE ITSELF AS YOU KNOW I'VE SAID WE'RE WILLING TO WORK ON THIS -- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S AN EFFORT TO CHECK THE DIEM IT SEIZE POWER TO UNILATERALLY -- TO DO THIS AND YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPROPER EXERCISE OF HIS FORTY TWO I DECLARE A BENEFIT MANDATED. WHEN -- THE REGULATORY AGENCY LACKS ANY LEGAL GROUNDING TO DO SO SO -- YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I'M GOING TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE -- SO MR LOUISE US YOUR CONCERN ABOUT RETROACTIVITY ACT RETROACTIVITY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? IS IT ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT A LIABILITY WHAT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT -- RETRACTED BECAUSE WHEN I AND ON A PREP AND I'M GONNA FRAME THIS IN A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE I'VE HEARD WE HEARD FROM OVER HERE. THAT SOMEONE WHO IS DIAGNOSED THEY HAVE A ONE TO TWO WEEK WINDOW. AND SO CENTER I FIVE GOT CANCER I'M NOT GOING TO WAIT TILL JANUARY. FOR YOUR BILL -- SO -- YOU KNOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO PULL THAT MAKE THAT DECISION PULL THAT TRIGGER WHATEVER -- BUT I'M NOT GONNA WAIT SIX MONTHS OR FIVE MONTHS OR WHATEVER IT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO LIVE IN IT MAY JEOPARDIZE MY MY ABILITY TO LIVE SO. SO I SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING BUT I WHAT WHAT ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IS THE RETROACTIVITY THAT THAT. YOUR CONCERN ABOUT WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY THAT YOU. ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WELL I MEAN IT. IT'S AN UNKNOWN LIABILITY -- ANYONE WHO -- FOUGHT THAT THEY SHOULD RECEIVE THIS BENEFIT -- COULD COME BACK AND BASICALLY -- YOU KNOW HOLD MY MEMBERS LIABLE FOR NOT COVERING IT WHEN WE WERE TOLD WE DON'T HAVE TO COVER IT. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION PICKED AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS PACKAGE THAT EXCLUDED THIS BENEFIT? SO -- WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SCOPE OF THAT COULD BE BUT WERE WORRIED ABOUT THAT -- WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT IT WAS NOT BAKED INTO OUR RATES INTO OUR PREMIUMS MOVING FORWARD -- IT'S NOT A COVERED BENEFIT SO IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY RATES THAT HAVE JUST BEEN SUBMITTED TO STATE REGULATORS -- AND COVER CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN -- YOU KNOW WE JUST GOT GOOD NEWS TODAY THAT. YOU KNOW PREMIUMS ARE NOT GOING UP VERY MUCH THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR. SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERSIGHT OF WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T A COVERED BENEFIT WHEN YOU CONSIDERED WHEN YOU CONSIDER A NEW BENEFIT FROM BEING ENACTED. YOU GET AN INDEPENDENT REPORT FROM AN INDEPENDENT BODY THAT TELLS YOU WHAT THE COST IS GOING TO BE. WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE GOING TO BE -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE HEALTH BENEFITS ARE GOING TO BE OF THAT COVERAGE BASICALLY BY SAYING THAT ANYTHING IS COVERED. BASED BY REGULATORY FIAT. YOU'VE ESSENTIALLY SURRENDERED YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE A A CONSCIOUS AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT. OF THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IT'S A BAD PROCESS. TO BASICALLY -- CODIFY INDIAN SANCTION. SO. I'M SORRY WHEN I GO BACK TO THE TO THAT SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. WERE DOES THAT RETROACTIVITY AND IS THAT? IS THAT. IN YOU KNOW. THE DOCTOR IS SAYING THAT THERE ARE GUIDELINES FOR INSURANCE AND AND THAT YOU CAN'T YOU'RE GOING BACK THAT FAR. BUT YOU ARE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHERE DOES THAT RETROACTIVE NEGATIVITY -- END YEAH WELL SO. YOU MISTER I'M NOT GONNA BE OPTION ON THE ISSUE I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TIME ONE WOULD WOULD BE AND IT. YOU KNOW I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY STATUTES OF LIMITATION THE CONTRACTS YOU KNOW WITH PLANS ENROLLEES LIKE I CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THAT. BUT I I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT A NOTABLE IT'S NOT DEFINED IN THE BILL AND WE WOULDN'T WANT TO FIND IN THE BILL ANYWAY AS WE THINK. THAT PEACE SHOULD BE COMPLETELY REMOVED AND IF IT'S REMOVED. WE CAN HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS OF THIS BILL ONLINE -- YOU KNOW A PROPERLY CRAFTING THIS BENEFIT ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS WE DON'T EVER. GO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON A BENEFIT MANDATE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY RECOLLECTION THAT WE'VE EVER DONE THAT. BUT WE'RE WILLING TO SETTLE THIS ISSUE AND WE'VE OFFERED AMENDMENTS TO DO THAT BUT THE YOU KNOW THE DECLARATORY EXISTING WALL LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE TO BE ROOM FOR THE BILL IN ORDER FOR US TO TO DO THAT. SO THEN I GUESS MY NEXT WHICH SO CDI. SAYS ONE THING DIEM EIGHT C. SAYS ANOTHER -- WE HAVE A CONFLICT HERE HOW DO WE FORESEE THAT CONFLICT BEING RESOLVED. IS IT BECAUSE IT THROUGH THIS BILL. THAT'S OUR GOAL AND OUR HOPE AND AGAIN FROM WHAT THE MHC IS TELLING US THIS IS NOT CHANGING THOSE TIME LINES. AT ALL IT'S JUST PROVIDING. THE THE PATIENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET CARE WE'RE NOT DELVING INTO LIABILITY WERE NOT EXPOSING THE PLANS. TO THAT EXTRA LIABILITY ACCORDING TO THE MHC I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE GENESIS OF THIS. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE HEALTH PLANS SO IT'S HIS JOB TO OPPOSE IT IT'S MY JOB. TO WHAT YOU KNOW I YEAH I'M JUST SAYING YEAH WE HAVE A DISAGREED WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT. AND I'M HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AND I'M. ME I I'VE WANTED NOTHING BUT TO HAVE THE HEALTH PLANS ON BOARD FROM THE VERY FIRST CONVERSATION I HAD IN MY OFFICE WHERE I SAID I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS BILL -- SO I'M NOT LOOKING TO TO NOT HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT I AM LOOKING. TO TO YOU KNOW AFTER DECADE. YOU KNOW GET THIS SOLVED AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE INMATES SEE THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT. SO ARE YOU OPEN TO DISCUSSING REMOVING THE RETROACTIVITY OF THIS. WE CAN CAN CAN I HAVE HER RESPOND RIGHT WELL I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU BECAUSE IT'S YOUR BILL I'M I DON'T MEAN I'M TRYING TO I'M NOT TRYING TO BE OBSTINATE BUT I JUST. ARE YOU OPEN ARE YOU OPEN ON OPEN BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MHC. AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE DOING IT. IS AN UNDERMINE BY THAT. CONVERSATION IS THAT MAKES SENSE I MEAN I MAY COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION. BUT I'M OPEN TO HAVING THE CONVERSATION. BECAUSE WE HAD THAT CONFERENCE CALL LAST WEEK SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE INMATES HE WAS SAYING IT'S A RED HERRING IN. YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD I WAS. THEY WERE ALL ON THE CALL -- THAT THIS IS NOT WHAT'S BEING ADVERTISED AS A REASON TO OPPOSE IT AND IT'S NOT WE NEXT WE NEED THIS LANGUAGE SO. I WOULD. BE HAPPY TO HAVE EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM WITH THE MHC YOU'RE WELCOME TO SIT IN THAT AS WELL. TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT I'MNOT PROMISING THAT I'M GONNA TAKE THAT AMENDMENT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. YEAH I JUST I'M ASKING IF YOU'RE OPEN TO YEAH DISCUSSION THIS PERHAPS A LITTLE OKAY. AND CAN I HAVE MY TECHNICAL PERSONRESPOND AS CHAIR SURE YES SO JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WAS VERY CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THESE LIMITATIONS THAT ARE BAKED INTO THE STATUTES. ARE ENFORCED -- BY THE INMATES SEE REGULARLY THEY PUT A SEVERE RESTRICTION ON ALLEGED RETROACTIVITY ALREADY -- SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY IT'S EXISTING LAW -- PEOPLE THAT ARE PASSED THESE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ESSENTIALLY THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS TO FILE A GRIEVANCE WITH THEIR HEALTH PLAN AND OR TO FILE FOR AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW WITH IT APARTMENTS -- THAT SIX MONTHS IF THAT HAS PASSED IT'S ALREADY PASSED AND THIS IS NOT CHANGING AT THE EXISTING LAWS YOU SIDE SO THOSE REMAIN INTACT. BUT I THINK THE POINT AND THAT'S THE POINT I'M GETTING AT AND I THINK THE CONCERN OF THE HEALTH PLANS AND I'M JUST. TRYING TO CLARIFY THIS FOR MY MIGHT. THERE IS A NO LIABILITY IN THAT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY PERIOD. WE DON'T KNOW -- WHO MIGHT CLAIM THAT ON THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE PAID OUT OF POCKET I? DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS A WAS A COVERED BENEFIT -- BELIEVING WHAT CITY I SAYS THAT IT'S NOT A COVERED BENEFIT SO SO THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THAT SO IT IS. A BIT UNPRECEDENTED FOR US TO GO BACK RETROACTIVELY. AND APPLY THIS RETROACTIVELY SO THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN STATE AGENCIES WHO DISAGREE -- WHERE IS THIS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE RESOLVED TO GET OUT? IS IT RESULT BY THIS BILL OR IS IT RESOLVED IN. GOD FORBID A COURT. I DON'T KNOW WE THINK THE BILL RESOLVES IT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] MR SANTIAGO. I'M ON THE MUCH I COULD ADD TO IT OTHER THAN I WAS A LITTLE -- I THINK A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED AS WELL. IN TERMS OF BUT THAT THE SAULS RETROACTIVITY OR NOT. I'M STRUGGLING. TO HOW TO GET DOWN AND I'M STILL SUPPORTED BY THE LIKE HOW YOU. REALLY GET THERE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE. THREE DIFFERENT POSITIONS. WITH THREE DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS RIGHT. THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING I'M OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION. BUT IN EVERYTHING THAT'S BROUGHT US TO THIS POINT WITH THE INMATES SEE. THIS IS WHAT WE FEEL CLARIFIES AND CODIFIES WITHOUT CHANGING THOSE TIME LINES IN EXISTING LAW. SO THAT'S WHY WE DON'T THINK THIS IS OPENING UP ANYBODY TO ANY ADDITIONAL LIABILITY THAT'S MY OPINION. CAN WE ADD ONE MORE THING. CAN I JUST ADD -- AS A PATIENT ADVOCATE OF SORRY. YEP I'M SORRY I'M TRYING TO GET CLARIFICATION ON SOMETHING I'M SORRY I WAS ASKING FOR SOME CLARIFICATION ON SOME NUMBERS SO SO PLEASE YOU CAN GO AHEAD. SORRY I'M SO. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AS YOU KNOW WE'VE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT AS SORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PATIENT ADVOCACY COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR MANY YEARS WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO. TO UNDERSTAND -- WHETHER THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE COVERED IT WAS ALWAYS BEING EXCLUDED BECAUSE IT WAS BEING CATEGORIZED AS AN INFERTILITY TREATMENT. AND THAT IS WHAT I THINK HAS ALWAYS OR HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCLUDED. FERTILITY PRESERVATION WAS NOT AND EXPRESS EXCLUSION IN THESE PLANS I MEAN THIS IS A A TREATMENT THAT IS MEANT TO PREVENT STERILITY IN THESE PATIENTS AND THEY HAVE NO. CHOICE BUT TO UNDERGO CANCER TREATMENT RIGHT THEIR LIVES AT RISK AND SO THE THE HIGH COST OF THE SERVICES PUTS IT OUT OF REACH UNLESS THEY DO IT IMMEDIATELY. AND SO WE WERE TRYING TO DISTINGUISH AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE REGULATOR -- EVEN VIEWED THIS SERVICE WHETHER PREVENTION OF STERILIZATION IF YOU WILL IS SOMETHING BASIC AS A BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICE THAT SOMEONE IS ENTITLED. TO AND YOU KNOW AFTER ALL OF OUR MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDERSTANDING FROM DIEM EACH SEE WAS. YES THIS IS HOW WE VIEW THIS THIS IS A BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICE AND SO IF IT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THAT PATIENT MEANING. THEY'RE FACING POTENTIALLY STERILIZING TREATMENT THEN IT'S A COVERED SERVICE AND IT SHOULD BE -- COVERED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THAT IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND SO THE PURPOSE OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL IN MY UNDERSTANDING WAS. NOT TO GO BACK AND CREATE ANY KIND OF YOU KNOW LIABILITY ON YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE IT WAS REALLY JUST TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR. THAT THIS IS ALREADY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE CUT BEING COVERED FOR THESE PATIENTS AND THAT THAT WAS THE POSITION OF THE REGULATOR. AND SO WE WERE TRYING TO CAPTURE THAT IT WAS NOT. TO CREATE SOME LONG TRAIN OF LIABILITY. ESPECIALLY SINCE THOSE DATES ARE ALREADY CODIFIED WE'RE NOT CHANGING THOSE STATES. SO IS IT AND AND AND I AND I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THIS AND AND I HANG ON TO IT. I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THIS HAS GOTTEN A LITTLE CONVOLUTED HERE SO IS IT YOUR IMPRESSION THEN FROM YOUR FROM. THE H. D. DAMMIT. THE WHATEVER THE MHC THANK YOU -- THAT THIS IS. IN THEIR VIEW AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT [inaudible] YES. BASIC HEALTH BETTER YES BUT THAT. BUT WILL DEBATE THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS ARE DEFINEDBY THE A FOUR BY OUR BY COVER CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE DISCONNECT IS HERE BECAUSE I I DON'T BELIEVE. IT IS AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT AND AND THAT IS WHERE THAT IS SO THAT'S WHERE THE DISCONNECT DOCTORS IS SCHOOLING ME HERE. THEY'RE SAYING IT'S A BASIC HEALTH NEED WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT. I THINK THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO DIE AS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS CONVERSATION YEAH THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THE MHC IS THAT -- THAT THIS IS A BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICE AS PER KNOCKS KEEN AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THE COVERAGE FOR THE CLARIFICATION COMES INTO PLAY [inaudible] OKAY. INTEREST MISTER BIGELOW ONCE. I THINK YOU JUST CHARACTERIZED IT IT'S AN NEEDS WANT. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SOUNDING HERE IN SOME WAY -- I THINK YOU HAVE THE PLANTS WHO ARE SAYING IT'S NOT COVERED. IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S WHAT YOU RECOGNIZE. THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL REPRESENT SO WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO YOU YOU'RE GOING TO CHALLENGE THAT. AND ANDERSON TO BE AN ISSUE OF THAT IN A COURT. WE'RE HERE TO SOLVE THE ISSUE. IT SEEMS THE DISCONNECT IS THE DATE OF TIME TO WIN THIS STARTS SO THEY EITHER YOU CAN COME BACK AND BIT IT AS A PROGRAM. THAT HAS A SERVICE SENATE OR NOT. BUT IT'LL BE A REQUIREMENT FROM THIS LEGISLATURE SO YOU NEED I THINK SENATOR TO CHOOSE A DATE THAT IT STARTS. FORGET THE RHETORIC TO RETRO ACTIVITY WE PICK A DATE. THAT THIS BILL TAKES EFFECT. AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE A DATE AFTER SOME DATE IN JANUARY SO THAT YOU HAVE TIME AS PLANS TO BID AND AND GET THAT ALL IN PLACE. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE THE EASIEST SOLUTION HERE. WHY WOULD YOU? WITH THAT NOT WORK FOR YOU. I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING IT THROUGH. TAKE YOUR TIME BECAUSE THIS IS RE CLARIFYING RECERTIFY. THE EXISTING LAW UNDER KNOCKS KEEN. SO IT'S ALREADY IN A FACT BY EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT EVERYONE OF THE APPEALS THAT ARE DENIED [inaudible] GETS OVERTURNED. SO THERE THE THE THE NECESSITY FOR A START DATE IS IN. THERE BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY IN EXISTING LAW. THAT IS WHAT THE CHAIR WHICH IS TALK ABOUT THERE'S A DISCONNECT WHAT IS BELIEVED AS A SERVICE AND WHAT IS IN REALITY A SERVICE. THAT IS THE DISCONNECT AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE IS THAT DATE. SO WELL I MEAN I I BILL WOULD NOT GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY ONE IS NOT AN URGENCY. NO I I I SO THAT'S WHEN THE THAT'S THE DATE I GET IT SO. BUT THE RETRO ACTIVITY THAT FOLDS BACK IN. SO YOU WHAT THOSE ARE ALL COVERED BY EXISTING LAW THERE'S ALREADY TIME LINES IN PLACE THAT WE'RE NOT CHANGED. MAYBE I COULD. IF I COULD -- MISTER LOUISE IF YOU COULD MAYBE RESPOND THAT AS WELL YEAH I MEAN ONE THING I'D LIKE TO RESPOND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BIGELOW -- THE APPEALS THAT I BELIEVE THE AUTHOR AND THE I'M ADVOCATES ARE REFERRING. TO OUR APPEALS WERE FILED -- UNDER THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS UNDER THE IT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND IF I COULD JUST BE LABOR JUST A LITTLE BIT WHAT WHAT INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW IS OUR I AM ARE. IT IS TO RESOLVE DIFFERENCES IN OPINION ON THE MEDICAL NECESSITY OF A COVERED SERVICE SO IF YOU SERVICES COVERED BUT THERE'S A DISPUTE OVER THE MEDICAL NECESSITY OF THAT COVERED SERVICE. VAN Vì AND ROLLY AND OR THE PROVIDER HAS THE ABILITY TO RESOLVE WITH THE HEALTH PLAN FIRST AND THEN GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE -- TO RESOLVE THIS QUESTION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY NOW. SOME FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICE APPEALS HAVE BEEN GOING TO INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW NOW SETTING ASIDE WHERE THAT WAS APPROPRIATE OR NOT -- WHEN THERE IS A DECISION? TO OVERTURN A PLAN TO NILE BASED ON MEDICAL NECESSITY THAT IS AN APPEALABLE BY THE PLAN AND THAT IS BINDING. RIGHT SO THE PEOPLE THAT OF ONE UNDER I AM ARE -- THAT AT LEAST BY LAW SHOULD BE GETTING THEIR SERVICES PAID FOR YOU KNOW WHETHER WAS RIGHT TO REFER HIM THERE AND ON THE FIRST PLACE. HIS SEPARATE QUESTION BUT IF WE IF THE HEALTH PLANS LOSE THAT I AM ARE. THOSE PEOPLE ARE COVERED -- OR THEY SHOULD BE UNDER LAW SO. GOING BACK TO THE POOL LET'S LET'S TAKE THAT ON FOR MOM. BUT ANYWAYS I WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS THIS NOTION OUT THERE THAT. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE APPEALED ARE NOT HAVING THEIR SERVICES. SO CLARIFY FORCE IS THIS A BENEFIT OR IS IT NOT A BENEFIT COVERED IT IS NOT A REQUIRED BENEFIT SOME PLANS DO COVER IT AS A WRITER. WHICH MEET WHICH UNDERLIES UNDERLINES THE NON REQUIRED NATURE OF THE BENEFITS SOME PLANS IN THE GROUP MARKET WOFFORD AS A WRITER MEANING THAT IT'S OPTIONAL. AND THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE REGULATOR BUT FUNDAMENTALLY NO THIS IS NOT A SERVICE THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE COVERED. UNDER THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS OR UNDER ANY STATUTE MANDATING ITS COVERAGE SINCE THEN. AND SO YEAH SO THE ANSWER IS NO. SO NO WONDER SENATOR YOU'VE STRUGGLED WITH THIS FOR A COUPLE OF GO ROUNDS TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER THE PIECES IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. ONE SIDE SAYS YES IT SHOULD BE COVERED. THE OTHER SIDE SAYS NO IT'S NOT COVERED. AND WE ARE. FOR CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TRYING TO DECIDE SIMPLY ON HOW HOW WIN WIN SO WHEN COULD A REASONABLE DATE. BE PUT IN PLACE TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. LET ME ASK THE PLANTS. WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE DATE SO WHAT WE HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS TO STATE THAT -- A HEALTH COACH. SKEWS ME SORRY HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN CONTRACT ISSUED AMENDED A RENEWED AFTER JANUARY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY SHALL INCLUDE COVERAGE FOR THE SERVICES JUST PARAPHRASE -- SO THAT IS OUR THAT IS OUR OFFER IN ITS ONE PART OF A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE OFFERED TO HELP. PARAMETERS AROUND THIS INCLUDING THE REMOVAL OF THE DECLARATORY EXISTING LOSS I THINK THE BODIES HEARD PRETTY MUCH. WHAT THIS IS THE CENTRAL POINT SO IS THAT A REASONABLE TIME FOR YOU [inaudible] TO PUT. IN YOUR BILL. THE JANUARY ONE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. I THINK IT NEGATES THE BASIC THESIS THAT WERE REDIFF REAFFIRMING. CURRENT LAW. BY SAYING THE NEW. THIS THE CURRENT LAW DOESN'T APPLY UNTIL THAT DATE I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM. AND I'M WILLING TO GO BACK TO THE MHC AND ASK THEM WHY THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST TAKE ON IT. THAT -- IT CHORE UNDERMINES THE BASIC THESIS OF WHY WE'RE HERE SO WHEN ARTICULATED THAT'S YOUR INTENT OF THE BILL AND I MAINLY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION I'M NOT WILLING TO COMMIT TO THE OUTCOME. I I GET THAT. I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST IF YOU ARTICULATED THAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO ARTICULATE THAT IN SOME WAY. TO DATE AN ABSENT THAT THERE'S ANY OTHER ABILITY TO CALM TO CONFLICT RESOLUTION THE DATE WILL BE RECOGNIZED -- JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY SAY THAT A LOT I ACTUALLY -- INTERJECTED RIGHT I SURE THINK. I THINK THE I MY MY INTERPRETATION OF THIS WHOLE IS HE'S NOT. READY TO DO THAT YET BUT I WHAT I DO SENSE IS THAT THERE IS A WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN. AT HIS PROPONENTS AND THE HEALTH PLANS -- WHICH I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT -- BUT I THINK YOU SEE THE CONUNDRUM THAT THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AND I THINK BUT BUT I I HOPE THAT. THE COMPANY THAT THE BILL MOTION COMMITTEE YOUR YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE ON THAT ABSOLUTELY OKAY -- WITH. THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.
