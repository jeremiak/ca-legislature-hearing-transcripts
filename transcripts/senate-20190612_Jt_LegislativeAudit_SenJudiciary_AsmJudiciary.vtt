COUNTERPART IN THE ASSEMBLY

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.132
ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE -- I THINK

00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:49.167
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:50.235
BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:53.405
APPRECIATION OF THE ROLE OF THE

00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:54.239
COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL

00:27:54.305 --> 00:27:55.340

UNDERSTANDING OF THE COURT

00:27:57.776 --> 00:28:00.612
SYSTEM I AM SOMEWHAT SURPRISED

00:28:00.678 --> 00:28:02.981
AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:04.482
THAT MOST PEOPLE TODAY REALLY

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:06.451
DON'T HAVE AN APPRECIATION FOR

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:12.490
THE ROLE OF THE COURTS THEY ARE.

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:13.658
BONTA ABILITIES TO ADD AS AN

00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:14.459
INDEPENDENT CO EQUAL BRANCH OF

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:17.162
GOVERNMENT SO.

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:18.463
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.765
RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:22.400
INDEPENDENCE AND CO EQUAL.

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:23.802
STATUS ALONG WITH THE

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:25.036
LEGISLATURE IN THE EXECUTIVE

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:26.704
BRANCH WE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN

00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:29.007
HEARING -- TODAY ON A NATIONAL

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:30.975
LEVEL -- EFFORTS TO IMPUGN THE

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:33.178
INTEGRITY OF OUR COURT SYSTEM

00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:35.280
WHICH DOES -- THEN THREATEN OUR

00:28:35.346 --> 00:28:37.148
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.551
HERE IN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE --

00:28:39.617 --> 00:28:41.086
IT'S BEEN KIND OF A BUMPY ROAD

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:42.520
IN ACTUALLY HAVING THE AUDIT

00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:43.822
CONDUCTED AND COMPLETED THERE

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.657
WAS A COURT CHALLENGE TO THE

00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:47.459
AUDIT EVEN BEING.

00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:52.297
ABLE TO PROCEED -- BUT I WANT.

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:53.465
TO PUT THAT IN THE PAST WE HAVE

00:28:53.531 --> 00:28:55.400
A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.635
ORGANIZATION WHO I BELIEVE IS.

00:28:57.702 --> 00:28:59.971
HIGHLY POSITION AND QUALIFIED TO

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:02.040
MOVE THE C. J. P. IN THE RIGHT

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:04.075
DIRECTION AND I'M VERY PLEASED

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:06.277
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THIS IS AN

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:08.413
ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF A SYSTEM

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.514
DESIGNED TO ENHANCE.

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.282
THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:12.750
FAIR AND EFFECTIVE

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.352
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.653
WHICH REQUIRES POLITICAL

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.189
NEUTRALITY AND INDEPENDENCE WE

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:19.057
KNOW THERE ARE INHERENT

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:20.725
CONFLICTS THAT EXIST IN OUR

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:24.028
JUDICIAL SYSTEM IT IS BY NATURE

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:24.929
AN ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM.

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:26.631
SO THERE IS OFTEN A WINNER AND A

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:29.100
LOSER IN A COURT EXPERIENCE AND

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:31.402
THE LOSER IS NEVER HAPPY IN

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:33.271
OFTENTIMES WANTS TO PLACE THE

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:34.906
BLAME ON A JUDGE.

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:36.875
INSTEAD OF THE LAW OR SOMETIMES

00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:38.543
ON COUNCIL AND HAVING PRACTICED

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.078
LAW FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AS A

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:41.479
LITIGATOR.

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:46.417
I KNOW THAT PART OF THE WELL --

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:47.785
UNFORTUNATELY THAT -- WHEN

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:49.854
SOMEONE LOSES A CASE --

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:51.823
FREQUENTLY THEY LOOK TO SOMEONE

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.391
ELSE FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:54.659
THAT LOSS.

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:56.528
AND FREQUENTLY THAT ISN'T THE

00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:58.163
CASE AND ON OCCASION IT IS AND I

00:29:58.229 --> 00:29:59.631
THINK THAT'S WHEN WE LOOK TO THE

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:01.666
COURTS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.334
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.936
BEING DONE FAIR FAIRLY AND

00:30:05.003 --> 00:30:07.672
IMPARTIALLY.

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:09.674
SO -- AND AND DON'T WANT TO

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:10.708
DISCOUNT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:12.377
IN FACT SOME BAD ACTORS WHO ARE

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:14.212
JUDGES AND THAT I SEE IS THE

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:16.147
ROLE OF THE C. JP BUT I ALSO

00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:17.682
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IN ORDER

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:19.284
TO HAVE A FUNCTIONING JUDICIAL

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.118
SYSTEM.

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:22.787
JUDGES NEED NOT BE AFRAID SHOULD

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:24.556
NOT BE AFRAID TO ADMINISTER

00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:25.690
JUSTICE.

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:26.457
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A

00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:28.326
BALANCE THERE AND I LOOK FORWARD

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:29.727
TO HEARING SOME OF THE THOUGHTS

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:31.262
OF THE AUDITOR AND OTHERS WHO

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.798
TESTIFYING TODAY ON MAINTAINING

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:35.133
THAT BALANCE SO.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.069
I HOPE WE KEEP THAT PERSPECTIVE

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:39.837
TODAY AS WE GO FORWARD AND WITH

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.506
THAT AGAIN THANK.

00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:42.473
REMEMBER SALAS FOR HOLDING THIS

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.374
PROCEEDING.

SEPARATION OF POWERS OUR RULES

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:57.622
THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY CLEAR

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:58.890
THAT WE HAVE OVERSIGHT

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:00.024
OBLIGATIONS OVER THERE THE TWO

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:00.858
BRANCHES.

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:03.661
PART OF THAT IS TO ENSURE THAT

00:31:03.728 --> 00:31:05.129
JUSTICE IS DONE AND OUR

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:06.497

LAST NUMBER OF YEARS.

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:19.377
WORKING WITH THE SENATE

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:20.612
JUDICIARY MY COUNTERPART THERE

00:31:20.678 --> 00:31:22.647
WE'VE TAKEN A HARD LOOK AT HOW

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.415
THE STATE BAR FUNCTIONS AND

00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:24.949

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:25.883
PROTECTION.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.518
AND AS WE WORK WITH THE JUDICIAL

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:29.287
BRANCH ONE OF THE ASPECTS THAT

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:31.422
CAME TO LIGHT IS THE COMMISSION

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:32.957
ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE AND

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:35.927
MODERNIZING THEIR APPROACH.

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:37.528
SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS GREATER

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:39.897
CONFIDENCE IN THE FUNCTION OF

00:31:39.964 --> 00:31:42.200
THE JUDICIARY YES MOST ALL OF

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:43.268
THE JUDGES.

00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:45.603
TAKE THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:46.804
PUBLIC OTHER OBLIGATIONS ON THE

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.306
CONSTITUTION VERY SERIOUSLY

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:50.775
HOWEVER WE HAVE HANDED JUDGES

00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:52.610
LAWYERS AND OTHER SUCH

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:54.112
SIGNIFICANT POWER THAT WHEN

00:31:54.178 --> 00:31:55.079
ABUSES HAPPEN.

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:56.948
THIS IS UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC'S

00:31:57.015 --> 00:31:58.916
CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY OF THE

00:31:58.983 --> 00:32:01.119
JUDICIAL BRANCH TO FUNCTION AND

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:02.754
THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENT

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.222
HONESTLY TO FUNCTION.

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:06.190
SO THAT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:08.726
THE WATCH DOGS IF YOU WILL OF

00:32:08.793 --> 00:32:10.495
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:11.896
NEED TO BE.

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:13.598
CLEAR NEED TO BE STRONG NEED TO

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:15.066
HAVE APPROPRIATE PROCESSES SO

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:16.234
THAT THE PUBLIC CAN FEEL THAT

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:18.736
THEIR GRIEVANCES OR HEARD.

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:20.438
AND DEALT WITH APPROPRIATELY AS

00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:21.806
IS POINTED OUT AND AS AS I THINK

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:23.941
WILL BE CLEAR AS WE GO THROUGH

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:25.076
THIS PROCESS.

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:26.444
JUDGES GET LOTS OF COMPLAINTS

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:27.912
LODGED AGAINST THEM AND MANY OF

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:29.514
THEM ARE.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.882
BECAUSE OF THE DECISION THAT WAS

00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:33.718
MADE -- BECAUSE OF THE THE

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:34.886
PROCESS THAT THAT THAT

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:37.388
INDIVIDUAL FELT WAS UNFAIR CG

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:39.657
PAY DOES NOT OVERSEE THE JUST

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:41.592
THE DECISIONS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:43.661
APPEAL PROCESS IT DOES NOT

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:44.495
OVERSEE.

00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:46.998
THE BY THE WAY OR THAT THE

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:48.232
ULTIMATE DECISION THAT A JUDGE

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:50.501
MAKES THE OUTCOMES OF THE COURT

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:53.838
BUT OVERSEAS THE JUDICIAL.

00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:56.708
OFFICERS AS THEY DELIBERATE AS

00:32:56.774 --> 00:32:58.142
THEY MANAGE THEIR COURTROOMS.

00:32:58.209 --> 00:33:00.745
UNDER THE OBLIGATIONS OF ETHICS

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.648
AND ON THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:04.916
JUDICIAL.

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:08.252
EXPECT OUR JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.053
WHO THEY THEY ARE IN OUR

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.320
COMMUNITY.

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:10.321
SO.

00:33:10.388 --> 00:33:12.090
INDIVIDUALS GREAT AUTHORITY WE

AUTHORITIES BEING.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.428
LEVIED APPROPRIATELY AND THE WAY

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:19.564
THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT'S THE

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.798
PROCESS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:22.200

HAS COME UP QUITE A BIT SHORT I

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:26.270
THINK THE LEGISLATURE.

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:28.406
STANDS READY TO DO WHAT WE NEED

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:29.374
TO DO.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.310
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:33.745
STATUTES THE LAWS EVEN THE

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:36.180
CONSTITUTION ARE APPROPRIATELY

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:37.815
MODIFIED SO THAT CGP CAN

00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:06.350
THE REPORT THAT WE THINK WOULD

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:09.353
BE BENEFICIAL IS A PERIODIC

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.421
QUALITY REVIEW.

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:11.922
OF THE CASES ARE WHETHER OR NOT

THERE NEEDS TO BE.

00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:17.061
THAT EXTERNAL.

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:18.562
AS WE DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT

00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:20.164
THERE IS A LEGAL ADVISER THAT IS

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:21.732
AVAILABLE TO SEE J. P. THAT

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:22.967
PERSON IS NOT.

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.502
INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATIVE

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:26.370

QUALITY CONTROL OVER AND ABOVE

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.782
WHAT A SUPERVISOR OR MANAGER MAY

BE PROVIDING TO INVESTIGATORS O

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.419
A VARIETY OF DITION IS DIFFERENT

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:42.453
ISSUES RELATED TO THEIR

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.854
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS WE THINK

00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:45.022
THEY COULD DO.

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:46.691
A BETTER JOB A MORE THOROUGH JOB

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:48.492
OF LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:50.227
ALLEGATIONS AND INVESTIGATING

00:38:50.294 --> 00:38:52.263
THEM FULLY AND AS I SAID SOME OF

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:53.964
THE GRAPHICS THAT -- IS CARDENAS

WILL STEP YOU THROUGH WILL

00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:57.201
ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THAT.

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:59.303
SECOND ISSUE IS RELATED TO SEE

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.738
BATES CJ PLEASE STRUCTURE.

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:02.940
AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY THEIR

00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:04.942
STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW IS UNITARY

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.144
STRUCTURE SINGLE BODY SO THAT

00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:08.245
BODY NOT ONLY CONDUCTS THE

00:39:08.312 --> 00:39:10.448
INVESTIGATIONS BUT ALSO MAKES

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:11.982
THE DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER WHAT

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:13.284
TYPE OF DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.453
CARRIED OUT -- IN THE EVENT THE

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:17.922
ALLEGATIONS ARE SUBSTANTIATED --

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:19.156
BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE ARE

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:20.391
SUGGESTING THERE NEEDS TO BE A

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.693
BI CAMERAL WHERE THERE'S AN

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.028
INVEST SEPARATE INVESTIGATIVE

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:25.663
FUNCTION AND THAT IN.

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.831
FOR BY THE TO A SEPARATE BODY

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:28.299
THAT MAKES A DECISION.

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:30.267
RELATED TO WHAT TYPE OF

00:39:30.334 --> 00:39:31.802
DISCIPLINE AGAIN SHOULD BE.

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.571
SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT -- WE

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:35.106
LOOKED AT OTHER STATES WE SAW

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:36.907
THAT SEVENTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:39.543
A BI CAMERAL -- STRUCTURE.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:41.245
AS AS OPPOSED TO UNITARY

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:43.047
STRUCTURE SO WE WE CERTAINLY

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.515
HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:46.917
THAT. ONE ISSUE THAT WE

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:49.019
IDENTIFIED THAT WHERE AT CJ P.

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:52.123
DOES NOT HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY IS.

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:53.557
TO EXERCISE OR REQUIRE

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:55.159
CORRECTIVE ACTION.

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:56.894
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE BAR MAY

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.696
REQUIRE AN ATTORNEY TO TAKE

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:00.431
TRAINING OR TO GO INTO A

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:01.298
SUBSTANCE ABUSE THERE'S A

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:02.666
LAWYER'S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IF

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:03.934
SOMEONE HAS A SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:05.035
ISSUE.

00:40:05.102 --> 00:40:06.570
MEDICAL BOARD HAS SIMILAR

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:08.305
REQUIREMENTS THE COMMISSION ON

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:09.840
JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE DOES NOT

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:12.009
HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.410
THAT TYPE OF CORRECTIVE ACTION

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.979
WHERE WHERE A JUDGE SHOULD BE

00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:16.447
TAKING SOME ETHICS TRAINING

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:18.182
PERHAPS OR SOME OTHER TYPES OF

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:20.751
TRAINING. TO STRENGTHEN THEIR

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.620
ABILITY TO SERVE ON THE BENCH.

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:24.121
NOW WE DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:25.623
THAT AND WE DO THIS IN THE

00:40:25.689 --> 00:40:27.758
REPORT THAT CJ P. ACTUALLY

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:29.493
DEVELOPED A PILOT PROGRAM.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.295
AND IT'S A MENTORING PROGRAM

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:33.430
WHERE IT'S REALLY MORE SEASON

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.166
JUDGES WHO ARE WELL RESPECTED

00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:38.135
JUDGES SERVE AS MENTORS TO OTHER

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:40.271
JUDGES TO REALLY HELP THEM.

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:41.972
MODIFY THEIR BEHAVIOR OR YOU

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:43.307
KNOW CARRY OUT THEIR THEIR

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:45.109
RESPONSIBILITIES AND IN THE MOST

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:47.511
PROFESSIONAL ETHICAL WAY AND

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.513
THAT MENTORING PROGRAM -- HAS

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.948
BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND NOW THEY

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:52.583
INTEND AS WE DESCRIBED IN THE

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.618
REPORT THEY MADE A DECISION TO

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:56.487
THEY STARTED IN NORTHERN

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:57.087
CALIFORNIA THEY DECIDED THEY

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:57.855
WANTED.

00:40:57.922 --> 00:40:59.256
TO CARRY THAT OUT THROUGHOUT THE

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:00.524
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVE AN

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:01.792
OPPORTUNITY FOR JUDGES TO BE

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:03.060
MENTORED SO WE THINK THAT'S IT

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:04.461
THAT'S A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:08.065
DIRECTION -- AS AS THE CHAIRS OF

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:08.566
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:10.434
MENTIONED SOME OF THESE CHANGES

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:11.902
WILL REQUIRE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:14.071
AMENDMENT -- AND WE DO HAVE A

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:15.639
RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THAT --

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:17.474
AND AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:19.410
ISSUES AND AGAIN MISS CARDENAS

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:20.644
WILL STEP YOU THROUGH THOSE.

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:22.313
SO STRUCTURALLY THERE WE THINK

00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:23.814
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A UNITARY

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:25.716
STRUCTURE THERE NEEDS TO BE A BI

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:26.617
CAMERAL.

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:30.054
OUR STRUCTURE IF WE'RE GONNA

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.388
FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES.

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:32.156
THE LAST AREA -- THAT I WILL

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:33.958
QUICKLY GO OVER IS TRANCE --

00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:35.593
TRANSPARENCY AND MODERNIZATION.

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.494
SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:38.128
MEMBERS WHO ASKED US TO COULD

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.930
CONDUCT THIS AUDIT IS HOW WELL

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:41.498
OUR OUR CALIFORNIANS BEING

00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:43.701
INFORMED ABOUT CJ PEAS ROLES AND

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:45.169
RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:46.737
AND AND OUR CONCLUSION WAS NOT

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.639
VERY WELL -- THEY DO CONDUCT

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:50.708
OUTREACH -- BUT THE PRIMARY

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:53.677
AUDIENCE FOR THEIR OUT REACH IS

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:54.778
LEGAL PROFESSIONALS IN COURT

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:56.080
EMPLOYEES.

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:56.614
SO YOU WITH THE JUDICIARY

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.115
PROCESS IN FACT WHEN WE LOOKED

00:41:58.182 --> 00:42:00.317
AT A FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:01.318
EIGHTEEN WE SAW NONE OF THE

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:02.586
EVENTS THAT HAD BEEN SCHEDULED

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:03.921
WERE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:05.756
REALLY EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:07.758
THEIR RIGHTS TO FILE A COMPLAINT.

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:09.560
HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT -- AND

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:10.628
HOW TO GO THROUGH THAT

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:12.663
PARTICULAR PROCESS SO WE MADE

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.131
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY REALLY

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:15.966
NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF OUT

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:17.034
REACH WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:19.403
GENERAL PUBLIC -- IN DEALING

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:20.838
WITH THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM A

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:22.506
COUPLE OF EXAMPLES SO MEDICAL

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:25.342
BOARD AND SOME OTHER REGULATORY

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:27.077
OUR BOARDS.

00:42:27.144 --> 00:42:29.513
REQUIRE -- POSTING OF

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.215
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO FILE A

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:32.750
COMPLAINT AGAINST A PHYSICIAN C.

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:34.151
J. P. DOES NOT HAVE THE

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.753
AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW TO REQUIRE

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:37.988
COURTS TO POST THIS INFORMATION.

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.224
ABOUT HOW A PERSON IN THE

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:41.492
GENERAL PUBLIC COULD FILE A

00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:42.893
COMPLAINT WITH C. J. P. IF THEY

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.996
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE THE JUDGE IN

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:46.897
THEIR PARTICULAR CASES IS.

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:48.699
I'M NOT CARRYING HIMSELF OR

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:50.701
HERSELF OUT PROFESSIONALLY OR IS

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:52.736
ENGAGING IN MISCONDUCT SO THERE

00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:54.705
NEEDS TO BE -- SOME ADDITIONAL

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.874
GUIDANCE POSTED RIGHT THERE IN

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:59.109
THE COURT ROOM -- CURRENTLY CJ

PIECE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:02.613
DOES NOT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.381
FILE A COMPLAINT ONLINE SO IF

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:05.249

THAT COMPLAINT IN THE MAIL.

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:12.156
THAT'S ARCHAIC -- A LOT OF OTHER

00:43:12.222 --> 00:43:13.924
STATES THAT HAVE THE ABILITY. TO

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:16.060
ALLOW FOLKS TO FILE A COMPLAINT

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:17.661
ONLINE SO WE HAVE --

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.396
RECOMMENDATION IN THE REPORT

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:21.465
THAT THE THE C. J. P. REALLY

00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:22.633
NEEDS.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.968
TO GET A BETTER CASE MANAGEMENT

00:43:24.034 --> 00:43:25.135
SYSTEM IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:26.203
SIGNIFICANT.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.672
INVESTMENT IN COST IT'S ABOUT A

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:29.306
HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:30.374
BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES AND OUR

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.710
ANALYSES OF SYSTEMS OUT THERE WE

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:33.877
THINK THEY COULD USE PURPOSE

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:35.279
PERHAPS AN OFF THE SHELF SYSTEM

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:36.947
WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS.

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:38.148
SO THEY COULD HAVE A CASE

00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:39.383
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WOULD

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.586
THEN ALLOW THEM TO ACCEPT

00:43:42.653 --> 00:43:44.421
COMPLAINTS ELECTRONICALLY.

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:45.990
AND THEN THE LAST AREA THAT I

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:47.157
WILL TALK ABOUT NINE AM IS

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:48.592
GUARDIANS WILL STEP YOU THROUGH

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:50.260
THE GRAPHICS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:52.363
HANDED OUT IS LOOKING AT THEIR

00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:54.531
RESOURCES IN THE EFFICIENCIES.

00:43:54.598 --> 00:43:55.833
I WE THINK THEY COULD BE MUCH

00:43:55.899 --> 00:43:57.768
MORE EFFICIENT AND DEVOTE MORE

00:43:57.835 --> 00:43:59.103
OF THEIR RESOURCES TO THEIR

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:00.170
THEIR PRIMARY ROLE AND

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:01.805
RESPONSIBILITY WHAT WE SAW IS

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.741
ABOUT. 40% OF THEIR BUDGET IS

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:06.577
SPENT ON NON CORE FUNCTIONS

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:08.345
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES OP SO

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:09.913
WE THINK THAT THEY NEED TO DO AN

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.181
OVERALL ANALYSIS AND REALLY

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:12.383
DETERMINE.

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:13.650
WHERE THEY SHOULD BE INVESTING

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:15.252
THEIR TIME AND THEIR RESOURCES

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:16.754
TO MAKE THEIR THEIR OPERATIONS

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.389
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT CERTAINLY AN

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:19.656
ONLINE SYSTEM?

00:44:19.723 --> 00:44:20.924
A BETTER CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:23.427
IS GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO DO

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:24.962
THAT.

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:26.263
OUR TRACKING OF A COMPLAINTS

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.131
DETERMINING WHETHER THERE ARE

00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:28.432
NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS SEVERAL

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.734
SIMILAR COMPLAINTS AGAINST A

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.037
PARTICULAR JUDGE -- SO WE THINK

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.505
THAT THERE THERE ARE

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:36.974
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE EFFICIENT

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:39.510
OPERATIONS.

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:40.110
FOR THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:41.211
PERFORMANCE.

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:42.446
I WANT STEP THROUGH ALL OF THE

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:43.947
RECOMMENDATIONS MISS CARDING US

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:45.349
AGAIN IT'S IN IT'S IN THE HAND

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:46.984
OUT BUT OF COURSE THERE IS THE

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:49.153
PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION RELATED

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:50.220
TO NEEDING A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:51.822
AMENDMENT AND THAT'S NOT JUST

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:53.524
RELATED TO THE THE GOING FROM A

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.858
UNITARY STRUCTURE TO A BI

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:55.993
CAMERAL.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.027
IT IT'S RELATED TO SOME OF THEIR

00:44:57.094 --> 00:44:58.362
pCORRECTIVE ACTION SOME OF THE

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:00.564
OTHER AUTHORITY THAT WE BELIEVE

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:03.033
NEEDS TO BE CLEARLY STATED.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.735
IN THE CONSTITUTION AS IT WITH

00:45:04.802 --> 00:45:06.403
RESPECT TO SEE JP'S ROLES AND

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.272
RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEIR

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:09.373
AUTHORITY.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.275
IN THE MEANTIME WE THINK SEE JP

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:13.210
COULD TAKE SOME STEPS. TO

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:14.678
IMPROVE SOME OF THEIR PROCESSES

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:16.380
THEY CAN ALREADY DO SOME OF THE

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:18.449
OUT REACH WE BELIEVE EVEN IF

00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:19.483
THEY DON'T WE SUGGEST AN

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.651
APPROPRIATION FOR THEIR CASE

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:22.453
MANAGEMENT WE STILL BELIEVE EVEN

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:23.320
IF THEY DON'T GET THAT

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:24.354
APPROPRIATION.

00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:26.390
THEY CAN FIND A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:27.624
THOUSAND DOLLARS -- TO COME UP

00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:28.926
WITH THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYTEM

00:45:28.992 --> 00:45:30.527
WE ALSO THINK THEY NEED TO HIRE

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:32.029
AN INVESTIGATIVE MANAGER.

00:45:32.096 --> 00:45:34.198
WHO CAN OVERSEE THE

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:35.833
INVESTIGATORS WHO ARE CONDUCTING --

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:38.168
THE INVESTIGATIONS AND GIVE THEM

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.870
GUIDANCE DID TO MAKE SURE IT'S

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:42.506
FULLY VETTING THE ALLEGATIONS

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:43.207
AND LOOKING AT ALL OF THE

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:44.641
EVIDENCE INTERVIEWING

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:46.310
APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS GOING

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.778
INTO THE COURTROOM OBSERVING

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:48.645
JUDGES.

00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:50.747
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO WE HAVE

00:45:50.814 --> 00:45:52.483
A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:54.451
THAT WE BELIEVE SEE JP CAN

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:57.721
IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY -- SO THAT

00:45:57.788 --> 00:45:58.822
THEIR OPERATIONS ARE ARE MUCH

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:00.524
MORE EFFICIENT -- AND THEY

00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.426
CERTAINLY CAN EDUCATE THE PUBLIC

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:03.460
AND A BETTER WAY THAN THEY HAVE

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:06.029
IN THE PAST SO WITH THAT MEMBERS

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.297
I WILL TURN IT OVER TO TO MISS

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:08.632
CARDEW EUNICE AND SHE WILL.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.033
USING THE HAND OUTS WILL KIND OF

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.069
STEP YOU THROUGH THE SAME ISSUES

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:14.037
BUT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:15.105
AND I AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:16.940
WILL FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:17.975
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IN THE

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:20.677
REPORT.

00:46:20.744 --> 00:46:22.980
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:23.914
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:24.548
IS KATIE CORTINAS AND I WAS THE

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:25.749
SENIOR AUDITOR ON THIS PROJECT.

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:27.217
IF YOU COULD TURN TO PAGE TWO I

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.519
WILL GO OVER THE FIRST MAJOR

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.420
FINDING FROM THE FIRST CHAPTER

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:34.424
OF OUR REPORT.

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:36.660
OUR TEAM FOUND THAT CDP FAILED

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:39.062
TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE ONE

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:39.630
THIRD OF THE CASES THAT WE

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:40.564
REVIEWED.

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:42.299
OF THE THIRTY INVESTIGATIONS ARE

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:43.734
TEAM ASSESSED CJ P.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.235
INVESTIGATORS DID NOT TAKE

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:47.137
REASONABLE STEPS TO DETERMINE

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.606
THE EXISTENCE OR THE EXTENT.

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:51.208
OF ALLEGED MISCONDUCT IN ELEVEN

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:53.777
CASES.

00:46:53.844 --> 00:46:55.045
THE EXAMPLE SHOW THE ALLEGATION.

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:56.046
INTO THE INADEQUATE

00:46:56.113 --> 00:46:57.147
INVESTIGATIONS ARE TEAM

00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:58.749
IDENTIFIED.

00:46:58.815 --> 00:46:59.650
THEY RANGE FROM MORE MINOR

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:02.019
ALLEGATIONS SUCH AS IMPROPERLY

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:03.487
DELAYING A CASE.

00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:05.155
UP TO MORE SEVERE ALLEGATIONS

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.490
SUCH AS HAVING A RELATIONSHIP

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:07.891
WITH A SUBORDINATE OR

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:11.295
THREATENING TO ASSAULT LITIGANTS.

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:12.996
THE STEP CGP INVESTIGATORS DO

00:47:13.063 --> 00:47:14.431
NOT TAKE CAN AFFECT THE

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:16.633
DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS THAT THE

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.235
COMMISSION CAN MAKE.

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:19.670
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS CAN HAVE A

00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:21.605
DIRECT.

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.173
NEGATIVE AFFECT ON THE

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.175
COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO ISSUE

00:47:25.242 --> 00:47:27.544
APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINE.

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:28.946
IF YOU PLEASE TURN TO PAGE THREE

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.981
THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF MISSTEPS

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:33.850
FOR CASE THAT OUR TEAM REVIEWED.

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:35.719
IN THIS CASE A LITIGANT ALLEGE

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.054
TO THE JUDGE AND A MEMBER OF THE

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.388
COURT STAFF DID NOT LET HIS

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:39.790
FRIENDS ACCOMPANY HIM INTO THE

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:41.258
COURT ROOM.

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.859
BY LAW THIS PROCEEDING MUST BE

00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:44.962
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:46.663
CJ P. INVESTIGATORS INTERVIEWED

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.365
THE COMPLAIN INTERVIEWED ONE OF

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:50.234
THE FRIENDS AND TRIED TO

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.069
INTERVIEW THE SECOND FRIEND.

00:47:52.135 --> 00:47:53.704
INVESTIGATORS ALSO REQUESTING

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:56.039
COMMENT FROM THE JUDGE.

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:58.008
HOWEVER CDP INVESTIGATORS DID

00:47:58.075 --> 00:48:00.244
NOT INTERVIEW THE COURTS STAFF.

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:01.712
WHO ALLEGEDLY BARRED ENTRY?

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:02.713
DID NOT DETERMINE WHETHER THE

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:04.014
EVENT WAS CAPTURED ON SECURITY

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:05.649
CAMERAS.

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:08.485
AND DID NOT OBSERVE THE JUDGE

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.254
AND SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.421
HE DID CONDUCT COURTROOM

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:12.956
OBSERVATION.

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:14.658
BUT ONE IT ALREADY INFORMED THE

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:16.026
JUDGE IT WAS CONDUCTING AN

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:17.160
INVESTIGATION.

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:19.196
INTO AND OBSERVED A DIFFERENT

00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:20.397
KIND OF CASE.

00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:21.632
WE THEREFORE DETERMINED THAT

00:48:21.698 --> 00:48:22.633
THIS WAS A QUESTIONABLE

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:25.469
INVESTIGATIVE APPROACH.

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:27.404
OUR TEAM DETERMINE THAT CJ PEAS

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:29.006
INVESTIGATIVE SHORTCOMINGS ARE

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:31.174
DUE TO A LACK OF KEY SAFEGUARDS

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.909
THAT WOULD ENSURE QUALITY

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:34.945
INVESTIGATIONS.

00:48:35.012 --> 00:48:37.547
CJ P. SIX INVESTIGATORS REPORT

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:38.882
DIRECTLY TO THE DIRECTOR CHIEF

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.017
COUNSEL.

00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:40.917
WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:42.719
ORGANIZATION IS NOT DEEPLY

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.187
INVOLVED IN EVERY CASE?

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:45.756
AND IS THEREFORE NOT LIKELY TO

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:47.291
CATCH GAPS IN INVESTIGATIVE

00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:49.893
APPROACHES IN A TIMELY MANNER.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.828
AS A STATE AUDITOR MENTION BEST

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:53.430
PRACTICES ALSO RECOMMEND THAT

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:55.465
BEFORE COMMENCING INVESTIGATIONS

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:57.167
INVESTIGATORS TO PREPARE A

00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.835
STRATEGY FOR EACH CASE.

00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:00.804
CJ PEAS INTERNAL MANUAL ALSO

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:03.006
ECHOES THESE BEST PRACTICES.

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:04.241
YES YOU J. P. INVESTIGATORS

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:05.575
CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:08.278
PREPARED STRATEGIES FOR ANY.

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:09.313
OF THE THIRTY CASES THAT WE

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:11.248
REVIEW IN.

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:12.549
PRIOR TO THIS AUDIT THERE HAD

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:14.785
BEEN NO INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:16.820
OF CJ PEAS INVESTIGATIONS SINCE

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:18.355
ITS INCEPTION FIFTY NINE YEARS

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:20.457
AGO.

00:49:20.524 --> 00:49:21.591
THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:23.460
OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT THE

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:24.027
LEGISLATURE MAKE A ONE TIME

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:26.463
APPROPRIATE. TO SEE JP CAN HIRE

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.731
A LIMITED TERM INVESTIGATIONS

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.433
MANAGER.

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:30.901
OUR OFFICE ALSO RECOMMENDS AS HE

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:31.902
J. P. DEFINE THE ROLES AND

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:33.203
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THAT

THAT POSITION NEEDS TO BE FULL

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:42.713
TIME.

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.047
FINALLY THE STATE AUDITOR'S

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:45.315

INVESTIGATIONS.

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:04.701
OUR TEAM FOUND THAT CDP FAILED

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:07.804
TO DETECT WARNING SIGNS OF ON

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:10.640

SIMILAR AND SERIOUS ON THE BENCH

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.348
MISCONDUCT.

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:19.716
THIS JUDGE RECEIVED EIGHT

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:21.818
COMPLAINTS OVER A FIVE YEAR

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.787
HISTORY. FOR THIS TYPE OF

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:25.856
MISCONDUCT ALONE.

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.591
COMPLAIN TO FROM YOUR ONE

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:29.526
BECAUSE OUR TEAM CONCERNED.

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:32.429
CJ P. OPENED AN INVESTIGATION.

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:33.964
THE JUDGE ADMITTED FAULTS AND

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.565
PROMISED NOT TO ALLOW THE

00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:38.435
CONDUCT TO RECUR.

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:39.035
THE COMMISSION CLOSE THE CASE

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:41.671
WITHOUT.

00:50:41.738 --> 00:50:43.907
CJ P. RECEIVE FOR ADDITIONAL

COMPLAINTS IN YEARS. TWO THREE

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:48.245
AND FOUR THAT IT DID NOT

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:49.813
INVESTIGATE AND IT DID NOT TAKE

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.849
ACTION ON FOR COMPLAINTS SEVEN

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.351
IN YOUR FOR C. J. P. FINALLY

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:57.554
OPENED A SECOND INVESTIGATION.

00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:59.189
HOWEVER IT IS COMPLAIN A THAT IS

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:01.057
OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE.

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:02.426
THIS COMPLAINING ATTACHED

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:03.994
TRANSCRIPTS THAT WERE

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.462
INSTRUMENTAL IMPROVING THE

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:07.164
MISCONDUCT OCCURRED.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:08.832
DO THE EVIDENCE THE COMPLAINANT

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:10.767
PROVIDED CJ P. DID NOT HAVE TO

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:11.568
PERFORM AN EXTENSIVE

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:12.502
INVESTIGATION INTO THIS

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:14.438
COMPLAINT.

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:15.872
FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION OF

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:18.008
THESE COMPLAINTS THE JUDGE

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:18.508
AGREED ON A CONFIDENTIAL

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:21.578
SETTLEMENT. TO RESIGN AND NEVER

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:25.015
SEE JUDICIAL OFFICE AGAIN.

00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:26.349
THE FINAL INVESTIGATION.

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:27.717
ENDED WITH THE JUDGE LEAVING THE

00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:29.186
BENCH.

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.754
BUT THE FACT THAT SEE JP DID NOT

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:31.955
DETECT A PATTERN OF

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:33.423
INAPPROPRIATE ACTIVITY.

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.892
IN YEARS TWO THREE OR FOUR

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.594
RAISES SERIOUS CONCERNS OVER HOW

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.830
IT APPROACHES ITS OVERSIGHT OF

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:41.298
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT.

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:42.799
THE FACTS SHOW THAT CJ PETERS

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.434
NOT TAKE STEPS TO IDENTIFY

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:46.470
PATTERNS OF COMPLAINTS AND

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:48.271
INITIATE INVESTIGATIONS WHEN

00:51:48.338 --> 00:51:49.506
NUMEROUS COMPLAINANTS ALLEGE

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:52.609
SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.044
AS A STATE AUDITOR MENTION CDP'S

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.579
OUTDATED AND AT CASE MANAGEMENT

00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:58.048
SYSTEM WILL HINDER ITS ABILITY.

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.416
TO DETERMINE IF A PATTERN OF

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:00.884
ALLEGATIONS EXIST.

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:03.753
THIS IS A SERIOUS DEFICIENCY.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:04.955
WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE RIGHT

00:52:05.021 --> 00:52:06.756
LEGISLATURE MAKE A ONE TIME

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:07.991
APPROPRIATIONS SOCI JP CAN

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:09.292
UPDATE ITS CASE MANAGEMENT

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:11.027
SYSTEM.

00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:12.162
AND OUR FIGURES ARE BASED ON

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:13.497
EXTENSIVE RESEARCH OF OFF THE

00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:14.831
SHELF PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE

00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:17.033
IN MEET CJ PEAS NEEDS WITH MINOR

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.468
MODIFICATIONS.

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:19.436
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S INCLUDED IN

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:20.704
THE BUDGET CGP SHOULD BEGIN

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.272
WORKING TO FIND ANY POSSIBLE

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:24.207
AVENUES TO IDENTIFY FUNDING SO

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:25.809
WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS IMPORTANT

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:27.310
RECOMMENDATION.

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:28.512
THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:30.680
OFFICE ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT CJ

00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:31.515
P. DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT

00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:32.816
PROCEDURES.

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:34.184
THAT REQUIRE ATTORNEYS TO LOOK

00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:36.820
FOR PATTERNS AND OPEN OR EXPAND

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:38.989
INVESTIGATIONS WHEN WARRANTED.

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:40.457
THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM IS

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.425
BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT AN

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:44.394
INDEPENDENT FAIR AND COMPETENT

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:45.862
JUDICIARY WILL INTERPRET AND

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:47.364
APPLY THE LAW.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.065
CJ PEAS ROLE AS THE SOLE AGENCY

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:50.634
RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.235
ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE ETHICS

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.036
CODE.

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:54.371
IS ESSENTIAL TO UPHOLDING THE

00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:55.639
INTEGRITY OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:58.241
JUDICIARY AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE

00:52:58.308 --> 00:52:59.843
IN CALIFORNIA'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.411
WHEN IT DOES NOT CONDUCT

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:03.380
ADEQUATE INVESTIGATIONS CJ P.

00:53:03.446 --> 00:53:05.115
FALL SHORT OF THIS FUNDAMENTAL

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:08.351
CHARGE?

00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:09.185
IF YOU PLEASE TURN TO PAGE FIVE

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:10.820
THIS OUTLINES.

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:11.421
IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF OUR

00:53:11.488 --> 00:53:13.523
REPORT REGARDING CONCERNS WITH

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:16.159
CJ P. STRUCTURE.

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:17.260
OUR TEAM FOUND AS HE DEBUTS

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:19.262
UNITARY STRUCTURE DOES NOT ALIGN

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:21.531
WITH BEST PRACTICES FROM THE

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:22.832
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION.

00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:23.934
THAT AIM TO ADDRESS THE

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.802
PERCEIVED UNFAIRNESS OF A SYSTEM

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:28.138
THAT COMBINES INVESTIGATION

00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:30.473
PROSECUTION HEARING AND DECISION

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.109
MAKING INTO A SINGLE PROCESS.

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:34.377
AS THE TOP PART OF THE GRAPHIC

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:36.546
SHOWS THE UNITARY STRUCTURE

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:38.515
ALLOWS COMMISSIONERS WHO MAKE

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:40.150
DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS. TO BE

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:41.685
EXPOSED TO INFORMATION ABOUT

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:43.420
ALLEGED MISCONDUCT THAT SHOULD

00:53:43.486 --> 00:53:44.754
NOT FACTOR INTO THEIR FINAL

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.389
DECISIONS.

00:53:46.456 --> 00:53:47.190
THEREFORE THERE IS HEIGHTENED

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:48.692
RISK AND AN OVERALL PERCEPTION

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:49.993
THAT COMMISSIONERS MAY

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.063
INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY.

00:53:53.129 --> 00:53:54.931
USE UNPROVEN INFORMATION TO

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:56.466
REACH CONCLUSIONS ABOUT

00:53:56.533 --> 00:53:58.602
APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINE.

00:53:58.668 --> 00:53:59.703
THE STRUCTURE RECOMMENDED BY

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:01.271
BEST PRACTICES DIVIDES THE

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:02.906
COMMISSION INTO TWO BODIES AND

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:04.441
INVESTIGATIVE BODY AND A

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.309
DISCIPLINARY BODY.

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:07.510
THE INVESTIGATIVE BODY WOULD

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:08.745
ASSESS EVIDENCE AND FORWARD

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:10.046
PROVEN ALLEGATIONS TO THE

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:11.615
DISCIPLINARY BODY.

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:13.583
UNDER THIS COMPOSITION NO MEMBER

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.518
OF THE COMMISSION IS INVOLVED IN

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:16.886
BOTH DECIDING WHETHER TO FILE

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:18.455
FORM FORMAL CHARGES.

00:54:18.521 --> 00:54:19.956
AND IN HEARING THE CASE

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:22.492
RESULTING FROM THOSE CHARGES.

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:25.028
AS A STATE AUDITOR MENTION

00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:25.528
SEVENTEEN OTHER STATES.

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:26.630
KNOWING HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:29.699
THESE BEST PRACTICES.

00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:31.201
PLEASE TURN TO PAGE SIX FOR

00:54:31.267 --> 00:54:33.103
ANOTHER CONCERN OUR OFFICE HAS

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:33.603
RECEIVED A PIECE CURRENT

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:37.907
STRUCTURE.

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.743
CGP CURRENTLY RELIES ON A PANEL

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:42.345
OF THREE JUDGES CALLED SPECIAL

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:43.813
MASTERS. TO HEAR CASES DURING

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.882
FORMAL PROCEEDINGS WHICH INVOLVE

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:48.084
A PUBLIC TRIAL AN EVIDENTIARY

00:54:48.151 --> 00:54:49.319
HEARING.

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:50.086
OUR REVIEW FOUND THAT THE

00:54:50.153 --> 00:54:51.354
SPECIAL MASTERS TEND TO BE MORE

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:54.124
LENIENT WHEN JUDGING THEIR PEERS.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:56.192
CJ PEAS RELIANCE ON JUDGES TO

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:57.827
HEAR CASES INVOLVING THEIR PEERS

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:59.996
ALSO FALL SHORT OF THE INTENT.

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:01.998
OF PROPOSITION ONE NINETY PASSED

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:04.768
BY CALIFORNIA VOTERS TWENTY FIVE

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:06.636
YEARS AGO IN.

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:07.270
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR SUPPORTERS

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:08.905
OF PROPOSITION ONE NINETY ARGUED

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:10.273
THAT IT WOULD ENSURE PUBLIC

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.941
CONTROL OF JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE.

00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:13.143
I WOULD ELIMINATE JUDICIAL

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:15.311
DOMINATION OF C. JP IN FAVOR OF

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:17.180
THE PUBLIC MAJORITY.

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:18.915
SINCE THE VOTERS PASSED

00:55:18.982 --> 00:55:20.250
PROPOSITION.

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:21.584
ONE NINETY C. J. P. HAS NEVER

00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:23.386
HEARD ITS OWN CASES.

00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:24.788
THIS LEAVES JUDGES WITH A

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:26.790
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.324
OVER JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE.

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:29.959
WHICH MAY IMPACT THE CONTROL

00:55:30.026 --> 00:55:32.128
THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS WANTED TO

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:34.364
PLACE IN THE HANDS OF THE PUBLIC.

00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:35.832
LASTLY THE COMMISSION DOES NOT

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:38.334
HAVE EXPRESS AUTHORITY TO

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:38.968
REQUIRE JUDGES ENGAGING

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:40.970
CORRECTIVE ACTION.

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:42.539
ALLOWING THE COMMISSION TO ISSUE

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:43.573
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WOULD

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.608
STRENGTHEN CJ PEAS ABILITY TO

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:04.094
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WILL REQUIRE

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.429
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:08.164
THE LEGISLATURE REFERRED AND THE

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:09.566
CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED THE

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:11.334
LAST MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:13.336
AMENDMENT IN.

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:14.370
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR OUR REVIEW

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:15.739
THE FIRST OF ITS KIND AND

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:17.707
CONDUCTED TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:18.808
SINCE THAT AMENDMENT.

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.143
FOUND THAT CDP STRUCTURE AND

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.878
PROCESS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:23.680
REFORMS FOR CJ PITA MENE ITS

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:25.181
MISSION.

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:26.316
THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:27.350
OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:28.651
CALIFORNIA ADOPT A COMMISSION

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:29.819
STRUCTURE.

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.154
THAT WOULD BE BOTH FAIR TO

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:33.523
JUDGES AND INCREASE THE PUBLIC'S

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.625
INVOLVEMENT.

00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:37.127
THIS STRUCTURE WOULD ESTABLISH A

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:38.261
TWO BODY COMMISSION WITH THE

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:39.829
PUBLIC MAJORITY IN BOTH THE

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:41.364
INVESTIGATIVE AND DISCIPLINARY

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:43.199
BODIES.

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:44.801
IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:46.002
DISCIPLINARY BODY TO HEAR ITS

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:48.838
OWN CASES ELIMINATING THE NEED

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:51.374
FOR THE SPECIAL MASTERS.

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:53.777
FINALLY IT WOULD ALSO AUTHORIZE

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:56.212
THE COMMISSION TO USE CORRECT.

00:56:56.279 --> 00:56:58.214
OUR OFFICE RECOMMENDS RECOGNIZES

00:56:58.281 --> 00:56:59.349
THAT THESE CHANGES ARE OF

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:01.084
SUBSTANTIAL.

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:02.285
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:04.354
NECESSARY TO ENSURE CJ P. IS

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.589
POSITION TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECT.

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:07.724
BOTH THE JUDGES RIGHT TO DUE

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:10.293
PROCESS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.529
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:14.397
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT WE

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:16.099
SUMMARIZE OUR LAST FINDING.

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:17.500
WHICH CONCLUDES THAT CJ P.

00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:19.269
SHOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND

00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:22.005
ACCESSIBILITY TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:23.740
AND TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:25.809
WE FOUND CJ P. HAS NOT PURSUE

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:27.544
CHANGES TO ITS OPERATIONS THAT

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:28.978
WILL BOLSTER TRANSPARENCY AND

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:31.281
ACCESSIBILITY DESPITE THIRTY

00:57:31.347 --> 00:57:33.449
YEARS OF PUBLIC DISTRUST.

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:35.552
CGP DOES NOT CONDUCT PUBLIC

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:37.320
OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS HOLD PUBLIC

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:38.922
MEETINGS OR ACCEPT ELECTRONIC

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.456
COMPLAINTS.

00:57:40.523 --> 00:57:42.192
MOREOVER CGP DOES NOT PROVIDE

00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:43.827
ADEQUATE GUIDANCE TO COMPLAINTS

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.261
ABOUT HOW TO SUBMIT A COMPLAINT

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:46.396
THAT WOULD INCLUDE SUFFICIENT

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:47.497
INFORMATION.

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:48.798
THAT WOULD IMPROVE ITS ODDS OF

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:49.899
MOVING FORWARD TO AN

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:51.868
INVESTIGATION.

00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:53.336
THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:54.470
OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT CGP

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:55.939
IMPROVE ITS EFFORTS IN ALL OF

00:57:56.005 --> 00:57:57.841
THESE AREAS.

00:57:57.907 --> 00:57:59.375
CJ P. ALSO DEPENDS ON THE COURTS

00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:00.743
COOPERATION IF IT WANTS TO

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.679
PUBLICIZE ITS EXISTENCE IN

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.147
COURTHOUSES.

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:05.548
AB NEEDS TO ADVERTISE THAT

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.654

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:12.589
THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:13.590
OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT THE

AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:36.546
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.214
WE DISAGREE WITH CJ PIECE

00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:39.482
PERSPECTIVE.

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:40.817
ALTHOUGH THE SUPREME COURT HAS

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.585

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:49.459
THESE COURT DECISIONS ARE

00:58:49.525 --> 00:58:51.661
DECADES OLD AND RELY IN PART ON

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:54.797

STRUCTURE THAT HAVE SINCE

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:56.599
CHANGED.

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:57.700
WHEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

COURT MADE THESE DECISIONS IT

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:00.336

MAKER FOR THE MOST SEVERE FORMS

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:05.708

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:07.443
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO IN.

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.044
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR PROP ONE

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:09.479
NINETY GAVE CJ P. ALL

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:11.514
DISCIPLINARY AUTHORITY.

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:15.518

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:17.153
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.322
NOT RULED ON WHETHER CJ PEAS

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.790
CURRENT UNITARY STRUCTURE

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:23.293
CREATES DUE PROCESS CONCERNS FOR

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:25.228
JUDGES.

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:26.296

SIDE -- I THINK THE MAIN.

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.660
CONTENTION FROM THE C. J. P. AS

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:12.228
TO WHY A UNITARY STRUCTURE IS

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:14.263
NOT A PROBLEM HAS BANNED THE

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.198
SUPREME COURT DECISIONS THAT

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:15.798
HAVE.

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.733
BASICALLY SPOKEN EXACTLY THAT

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.469
BEFORE -- THERE HAVE BEEN

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.604
SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS BY THE

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.172
SUPREME COURT IN YEARS PRIOR

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.507
ABOUT WHETHER THE UNITARY

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.176
STRUCTURE IS IN FACT PROBLEMATIC --

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.211
HOWEVER IS MISS CUTTING AS

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:30.313
INDICATED BEFORE IT WE OBSERVE

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:32.115
THAT THIS DECISION DECISIONS ARE

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:34.650
DECADES OLD AND AND PROBABLY

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:36.018
EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY.

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.020
THERE'S BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.489
IN THE C. JP'S AUTHORITY SINCE

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.990
THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS WERE

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:43.626
MADE -- CERTAINLY THERE HAVE

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:44.127
BEEN A FEW SUPREME COURT

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.129
DECISIONS -- SINCE PROP ONE

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:47.697
NINETY PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:48.531
FOUR BUT NONE OF THOSE HAVE

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:49.966
SPECIFICALLY SPOKEN TO THE

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:50.800
QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU THE

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:53.069
UNITARY STRUCTURE IS PROBLEMATIC

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:55.404
FOR A JUDGE -- AGAIN IN IT HERE

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:56.739
IT'S TO THE BEST PRACTICES THAT

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.174
HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE

01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:00.042
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION AS WELL

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.410
AS FOR THE CONCERNS THAT COULD

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.012
PRESENT THEMSELVES WHEN A JUDGE

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:05.681
IS -- ESSENTIALLY FACING --

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:10.786
CHALLENGING THE COMMISSION --

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.054
THAT WAS BOTH THE INVESTIGATE.

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.189
THIS FINAL DECISION MAKER AS TO

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:13.756
WHETHER DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:14.390
ISSUED WE MADE OUR

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:15.625
RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY BE

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:19.061
SPLIT INTO A BY CAMEL STRUCTURE.

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:20.163
MY NAME MY NAME IS HEATHER

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:22.098
KENDRICK I WAS THE ATTORNEY WHO

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.733
ASSISTED THE AUDIT TEAM.

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:26.969
THE AS A POINT OF DISTINCTION

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.404
THESE DECISIONS THAT CAME OUT

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.773
PRIOR -- TO NINETEEN PRIOR TO

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.241
PROPOSITION ONE NINETY COMING

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.677
INTO AFFECT THOSE STRUCTURE AT

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.379
THE TIME WAS THAT THE ATTORNEY

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:37.813
GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULD ACT AS

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.782
THE PROSECUTOR PROSECUTORIAL

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:40.483
FUNCTION.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.817
AND THEN THE SUPREME COURT WOULD

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.419
BE THE FINAL DECISION MAKER ON

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.588
ALL THE RELIEF SEVERE FORMS OF

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:46.789
DISCIPLINE.

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.858
AND THEN THE CJ P. WAS MORE

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.993
WORKING IN IN THE EVIDENTIARY

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.728
CAPACITY IN DOING MINDING SING

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:54.130
CONCLUSIONS AND SO THERE IS

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:58.501
REALLY KIND OF A SPLIT.

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:00.903
OF HOW.

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.605
A A PROCESS OF HOW IT JUDGES

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.106
CASE WOULD GO THROUGH THERE WAS

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.007
A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE THE

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:06.909
PROSECUTOR THE DECISION MAKER

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:09.111
THE EVIDENCE FACT FINDER AND SO.

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.546
ONCE PROP ONE NINETY CAME INTO

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:12.615
EFFECT ALL OF THOSE FUNCTIONS

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.718
CAME INTO THE ONE UNITARY

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:18.921
STRUCTURE CGP [inaudible]

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.360
ASSEMBLY.

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:26.195
LINE ON THAT POINT PLEASE ENTER

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:27.230

EFFECTIVELY GET AT THE ROOT THIS

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:59.795
IS THE SEPARATION THAT YOU'RE

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:00.596
ASKING.

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:01.530
FOR IT IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY DO

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:02.531
THAT HOWEVER THAT IS NOT WHAT

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:04.133
OUR CONSTITUTION ALLOWS FOR

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.601
CURRENTLY THE CONSTITUTION SAYS

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.204
THAT THE COMMISSION CJ P. AS THE

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.473

FROM SO BUT THEY MAKE IT.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.580
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVERY

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.348
COMMISSIONER HAS SERVICE I READ

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:20.916
IT YOU SEE EVERY COMMISSIONER

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:22.285
HAS.

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.686
TO DO EVERY INVESTIGATION.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.154
THEY MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:26.455
WHETHER IN THE INVESTIGATION

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.958
GOES FORWARD.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:30.793
THEY MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.328
WHETHER OR NOT IT BUT FORMA

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:33.429
DISCIPLINE SHOULD HAPPEN THEY

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:35.898
HEAR THE THE JUDGES WHEN THE

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:37.833
JUDGES COME FORWARD AND SAY YOU

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.902
KNOW I I DISAGREE OR I WANT TO

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.270
PRESENT SOME EVIDENCE.

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:42.204
SO THEY'RE INVOLVED IN ALL THE

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:44.307
STAGES OF THE PROCESS.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:45.908
WE ALSO TO TALK TALK TO CJ P.

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:47.843
ABOUT SOME OF THOSE POTENTIAL

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.245
ALTERNATIVES AND THE BIGGEST

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.013
CONCERN THAT THEY EXPRESSED WAS

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.748
LOGISTICS.

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.750
IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:56.485
BEST MANAGER SYSTEM LIKE THAT

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:57.987
SOME OF THESE CASES CAN GO ON

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.355
FOR MULTIPLE YEARS.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:00.923
AND SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:02.158
THEM TO MANAGE HAVING

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:03.492
COMMISSIONERS BE INVOLVED IN ONE

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:05.061
PART OF THE PROCESS THOSE

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:06.696
COMMISSIONERS MIGHT TERM OUT.

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:08.164
AND THEN -- WOULDN'T BE

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:10.099
AVAILABLE TO BE INVOLVED IN THEM

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.301
THE REST OF THE PROCESS AND SO --

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:13.869
IT WAS LOGISTICAL REASONS THAT

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:16.072
ALTERNATELY LET US TO ACCEPTING

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.874
BEST PRACTICES AND RECOMMENDING

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:20.009
A BICAMERAL STRUCTURE.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.477
I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:23.145
ROLE OF THE SUPERVISOR WHY WOULD

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.814
YOU NEED SUPERVISOR IF FOR ALL

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.816

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:28.351
INVESTIGATION TO MAKE ALL

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:29.418
DECISIONS.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:30.886
WHEN I I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:33.622
THE ROLE THE SUPERVISOR -- IF

01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:35.157

THAT THE EVIDENTIARY.

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:39.695
EVIDENTIAL.

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:40.329
THREE PORTION OF IT AND THEN YOU

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:40.696
HAVE [inaudible]

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:41.597
THE COMMISSION.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:42.998
ADJUDICATING NOW YOU'RE SAYING I

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:43.866
THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:44.800
SAYING IS THAT NO THE

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:45.968
COMMISSIONERS HAVE TO BE

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.737
INVOLVED FROM DAY.

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:48.371
ONE AND THEY HAVE TO BE IN THE

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:50.072
COURTHOUSE WATCHING OBSERVING

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:52.675
THE JUDGES.

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.243
WHAT BENEFIT IS THAT SAID SO TO

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.077
CLARIFY?

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:56.579
THE COMMISSION IS INVOLVEDAT

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.280
THE KEY DECISION POINTS IN A

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.316
CASE SO THE A COMPLAINT IS

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:02.184
RECEIVED BY THE COMMISSION IT'S

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:03.686
REVIEWED INITIALLY BY ITS INTAKE

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.087
STAFF WHO REACH A PRELIMINARY

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:06.722
CONCLUSION ABOUT WHETHER THERE

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:07.523
SHOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION OR

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:08.057
NOT.

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:09.492
THAT'S THE FIRST DECISION POINT

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:11.527
AT WHICH THE COMMISSION IS

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.562
INVOLVED AND AND MAKES A

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.631
DECISION AS A BODY -- BUT NO

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.433
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT ACTING

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.368
AS THE INVESTIGATOR IN SO FAR AS

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:20.703
THEIR OUT AT THE COURTHOUSE IS

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.872
DOING THE THE BOOTS ON THE

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.173
GROUND WORK THEMSELVES THEY HAVE

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.641
IT A STAFF OF INVESTIGATORS TO

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:26.675
DO THAT FOR THEM.

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:28.010
THE PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATIVE

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.246
SUPERVISOR POSITION IS TO ENSURE

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:32.214
THAT THE WORK DONE BY THOSE SIX

01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:34.016
INVESTIGATORS AS OF THE HIGHEST

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.684
QUALITY AS TIME IT'S CRAZINESS

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:36.452
MENTIONED.

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:38.187
WE FOUND PROBLEMS WITH THE

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:39.722
THOROUGHNESS OF THE INVESTING

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:40.856
SOME OF THE INVESTIGATIONS WE

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:42.491
REVIEWED ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.059
INVESTIGATIONS WE FELT LIKE WERE

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.194
NOT THOROUGHLY CONDUCTED.

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:46.462
THAT'S WHAT THE INVESTIGATIVE

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:49.565
SUPERVISOR WOULD INSURE SO THAT.

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:50.633
WHEN THE INVESTIGATORS COME BACK

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:51.767
TO THE COMMISSION AND PRESENT

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.669
THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EITHER

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.171
CLOSING THE INVESTIGATION WITH

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:58.107
NO FURTHER ACTION OR -- ISSUING

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:00.109
DISCIPLINE THAT THE COMMISSION

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:01.477
CAN HAVE ALL AVAILABLE

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:02.978
INFORMATION AND MAKE A FULLY

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:08.350
INFORMED DECISION.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.619
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT MAYBE.

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.288
MIKE HOUSE KEYS EXAMPLE. FOR

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:13.589
EXAMPLE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:15.925
EARLIER ABOUT THE ON PAGE.

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:17.359
FOUR WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.829

FIVE FOR THE JUDGE CENTER

01:08:20.896 --> 01:08:21.730
THERE'S BEEN SOME MEDIA

01:08:21.797 --> 01:08:24.133
ATTENTION ON THIS AS WELL --

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.703
THOSE SERIOUS WITH THE COLORS

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:28.804
YEARS BREACH OF MISCONDUCT.

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:32.141
AND THE TEAM DIDN'T.

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:34.176
CJ P. A THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.811
IS BASICALLY DRAG THEIR FEET.

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:36.812
IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY DOING

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:38.581
ANYTHING -- AT THE END OF THE

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:39.982
DAY THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:43.385
BUT THE JUDGE STILL -- ABDICATED

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.754
HIS ROLE SO IN.

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.590
A BICAMERAL SYSTEM HOW WOULD

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:50.192
THAT ACTUALLY WORK AS OPPOSED.

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:54.930
TO THE UNITARY -- THE UNITARY AT

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:57.967
CAROL SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW.

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:58.567
MAYBE OUR PROVIDE SOME CLARITY

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.803
AND RIGHT SO WE CAN WE CAN UE

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.571
THE INFORMATION ON PAGE FOR THIS

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.773
STEP THROUGH HOW IT WOULD WORK

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.775
IN A BY CAMEL SITUATION SO -- IN

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.244
THE BY CAMEL STRUCTURE THAT WERE

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.079
SUGGESTING THE WORK THAT IS DONE

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.181
BEFORE THE DECISION WHETHER

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:13.215
DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE ISSUED OR

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:14.617
NOT WHAT ALL HAPPENED ON THE

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.752
INVESTIGATIVE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.355
SO IN LOOKING AT PAGE.

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.357
FOUR COMPLAINTS ONE THROUGH.

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:23.526
WELL REALLY WANT ONE THROUGH

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:24.126
EIGHT ALL OF THE INVESTIGATIVE

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:24.894
WORK.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.495
BY THE INVESTIGATIVE BODY THEY

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:27.730
WOULD HAVE A STAFF.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:29.465
PROBABLY THE SAME STAFF THAT THE

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:30.799
COMMISSION CURRENTLY HAS.

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.902
THAT WOULD DO THE INVESTIGATIVE

01:09:32.968 --> 01:09:34.136
GROUNDWORK.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.671
HOWEVER IF THOSE INVESTIGATORS

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.806
FELT LIKE DISCIPLINE WAS MERITED

01:09:37.873 --> 01:09:38.874
OTHER WORDS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.976
ABLE TO CLEARLY AND CONVINCINGLY

01:09:41.043 --> 01:09:42.678
PROOF THAT THE JUDGE HAD ENGAGED

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:43.579
IN MISCONDUCT.

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:45.114
THEY WOULD THEN MAKE A REFERRAL

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.615
TO THE DISCIPLINARY BODY WHO

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.417
WOULD THEN OPINE ON ONE THING

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:49.251
AND ONE THING ONLY WHICH IS

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:50.352
BASICALLY WHAT LEVEL OF

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:52.621
DISCIPLINE IS MERITED HERE GIVEN

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.056
THE PROVEN MISCONDUCT.

01:09:54.123 --> 01:09:55.224
SO.

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:57.760
IN THE SITUATION OF COMPLAINTS

01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:58.794
SEVEN AND EIGHT WERE AN

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.496
INVESTIGATION IS OPENED THAT

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:02.531
WOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION OPEN

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:04.033
BY THE INVESTIGATIVE BODY.

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:06.635
NGUYEN COMPLAINANT EIGHT

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:07.970
SUBMITTED THE TRANSCRIPTS THAT

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:08.704
MUST CRAZINESS TALKED ABOUT

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.639
EARLIER THAT WERE ENDED ENDED UP

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.608
BEING THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:13.943
EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT.

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:15.010
I AM IS THAT SIMPLY THERE'S A

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:17.913
COURT TRANSCRIPT THAT PROVED THE

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.348
JUDGE AND ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT.

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:20.716
THEN THE INVESTIGATIVE BODY

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:22.384
WOULD REFER THAT TO THE

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:23.619
DISCIPLINARY SIDE OF THE HOUSE.

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:26.055
THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY ACCESS TO

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:27.823
THE PROVEN ALLEGATIONS SO FOR

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:28.958
INSTANCE IF COMPLAINING EIGHT

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:30.926
ALLEGED SEVERAL OTHER INSTANCES

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:31.961
OF MISCONDUCT THAT WERE NOT

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:33.462
PROVEN THE DISCIPLINARY BODY

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:34.630
WOULD NOT BE PRIVY TO THAT

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:36.098
INFORMATION.

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:37.967
THEY WOULD ONLY KNOW WHAT THE

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.568
COMMISSION'S INVESTIGATIVE BODY

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:39.902
HAD.

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:42.338
LAIN CAM INTEGRATE SUBSTANTIATED.

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:43.639
AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE A

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.608
DISCIPLINARY DECISION.

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:46.742
SERVICE SAY THE INVESTIGATIVE

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:47.910
BODY THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:49.244
TAINTED BECAUSE ACTUALLY

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:50.980
REVIEWING ALL OF THE FACTS OF

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:53.382
THE SOME OF THOSE THINGS WERE

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:55.684
JUST BEST FOR THE DISCIPLINARY.

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:56.285
OKAY WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:58.887
MOVE TO SENATOR JACKSON THEN

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:01.156
SENATOR MINING THAN SENATOR COPY

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:02.758
AT ALL.

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:04.293
SO CENTER JACKSON PLEASE AND I'M

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.195
GONNA HAND OVER THE GAVEL.

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.796
THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:09.698
APPRECIATE THIS -- AGAIN LONG

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:12.701
TIME IN COMING -- THE THE

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:16.238
PROPOSITION WHICH REFLECTED A

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:18.707
PUBLIC THE PUBLIC'S.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.042
DESIRE TO BE MORE.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:23.145
HAVE A MORE OPEN AND ROBUST

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.980
JUDICIARY -- I THINK WAS VERY

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.782
IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:27.883
POINTING OUT.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.519
THE INHERENT UNFAIRNESS OF THE

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:31.887
UNICAMERAL SYSTEM.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:35.691
WE HAVE BEEN IRONICALLY TOLD BY --

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:40.129
THE COURTS THAT -- IN SITUATIONS

01:11:40.195 --> 01:11:40.996
UNDER A PROP.

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:43.732
TITLE NINE WHEN WE'VE HAD --

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.534
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES HAVE A

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:47.936
UNICAMERAL TYPE PROCESS THAT THE

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.705
INVESTIGATOR WAS ALSO THE THE

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:53.742
DAY THE FACT FINDER AND THE

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:57.212
DISCIPLINARY -- THAT THAT WAS A

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:58.547
VIOLATION TO PROCESS.

01:11:58.614 --> 01:11:59.548
AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A VERY

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:00.949
SIMILAR THE ANALOGY I THINK IS

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:02.251
QUITE SIMILAR HERE AND AS WAS

01:12:02.317 --> 01:12:03.519
POINTED OUT.

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:05.521
WHEN YOU'RE A RECIPIENT OF

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:07.723
UNCONFIRMED AN UNSUBSTANTIATED

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.792
ALLEGATIONS TO BE ALSO THE ONE

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.427
HEARING THE ACTUAL PROCEEDING

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:12.795
AND THEN MAKING A DISCIPLINARY

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:14.663
DECISION REALLY DOES VIOLATE TO

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:15.998
PROCESS SO?

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:17.433
I I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT.

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:20.069
THAT THAT IS PART OF YOUR

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:21.704
RECOMMENDATION THAT THAT THAT

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:24.440
IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE JUDGES --

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:25.574
IN THE PROCESS.

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:27.376
WHAT WHAT CONCERNS ME IS A

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:29.545
COUPLE THINGS THAT I ALLUDED TO

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:32.281
OUR IN MY OPENING REMARKS?

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:33.916
WHAT IS MISCONDUCT?

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:34.850
I'D I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.085
SOMETHING WE REALLY HAVE TO BORE

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:38.287
DOWN ON BECAUSE FREQUENTLY WHAT

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:41.290
WE SEE IS WE SEE LITIGANTS WHO

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:43.625
ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE DECISION.

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:45.761
THAT COMES DOWN FROM THE COURT.

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:46.962
AND WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO SORT

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.297
OF SEPARATE THAT BECAUSE THERE

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:49.798
IS A PROCESS NOW TO CALL THE

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:51.900
APPELLATE PROCESS WHERE IF

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:53.402
YOU'RE DISSATISFIED WITH THE

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:55.037
DECISION IT'S REACHED YOU CAN

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.305
REACH YOU CAN APPEAL.

01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:57.906
AND THAT I THINK WE ALL WANT TO

01:12:57.973 --> 01:12:58.674
SEE.

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.075
SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:03.112
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT WE WE BY

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:05.314
VERY THE VERY NATURE OF THE

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.083
PROCEEDING SHOULD BE TALKING

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:08.751
ABOUT.

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.085
THE BEHAVIOR.

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:12.855
COURT MORE THAN THE DECISION OF

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.189
THE COURT.

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:17.860
AND AND SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU --

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:20.896
IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS HERE AND

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:23.132
ANALYSES OF THE THE FUNCTIONING

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:26.435
OF THIS SHE JP TOOK A LOOK AT

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:29.404
WHAT REALLY IS THE ISSUE HERE --

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:32.508
AND THAT IS WHETHER JUDGES ARE

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:35.077
RUDE TO LITIGANTS -- WHETHER

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.312
THEY ARE BEHAVING IN AN

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:39.615
INAPPROPRIATE WAY AS A AS A

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:41.450
JUDGE OR AS A HUMAN BEING WE'VE

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:43.051
HEARD SOME HORRIFIC STORIES

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:44.753
ABOUT THINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.522
AGAIN BY SMALL HOPEFULLY SMALL

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:48.957
MINORITY OF JUDGES BUT FOR WHICH

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:50.292
ACTION CLEARLY.

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:51.894
IS APPROPRIATE.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.695
SO WE HAVE BEHAVIOR WE HAVE

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.764
TEMPERAMENT -- I HAVE BEEN

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:57.766
YELLED AT BY JUDGES AND NOT BEEN

01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:58.901
VERY HAPPY AT IT AND COURSE YOU

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.936
CAN'T YELL BACK IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:03.839
OUNCE OF COMMON SENSE -- AND

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:05.641
THESE CAN BE PATTERNS THAT THAT

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:07.643
COME FORWARD A LOT OF THIS

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.878
THOUGH IT SEEMS TO ME CAN BE

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:12.748
RESOLVED THROUGH.

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:14.216
THE EDUCATION PROCESS.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.918
AND YOU INDICATED WHICH I WASN'T

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:17.352
AWARE OF THAT THE COURT AT THAT

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:18.687
THE C. JP DOESN'T HAVE THE

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:20.722
AUTHORITY. TO REQUIRE THAT I

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:23.225
THINK MOST JUDGES WANT TO DO A

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.227
GOOD JOB I THINK -- I RECALL.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.896
I KNEW WHO SUFFERED -- US OF

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:30.365
YOUR BLOOD SUGAR PROBLEMS SO IF

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:31.600
YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN COURT A

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:34.536
QUARTERTO TWELVE WITH THE JUDGE.

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.004
YOU WERE LIKELY.

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:37.306
TO IT HAVE SOME KIND OF

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:38.874
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR BECAUSE

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.676
HIS BLOOD SUGAR WAS TOO LOW --

01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:42.177
SIMPLE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT CAN

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:43.478
BE ADDRESSED I THINK

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:46.348
APPROPRIATELY THROUGH EDUCATION.

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:47.783
BUT I'M I'M CURIOUS WHEN YOU

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.218
TALK ABOUT.

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:52.054
THE INITIAL DECISION MAKER WHO

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.622
IS THE INTAKE PERSON.

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:55.057
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE INTAKE

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:58.227
PERSON COMES IN AND AND DECIDES --

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:01.330
WHETHER OR NOT TO GO FORWARD.

01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:02.898
DID YOU EXAMINE THE KINDS OF

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:05.267
THINGS THAT THE INTAKE PERSON IS

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.035
TRAINED TO LOOK FOR SO THAT WE

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:09.504
CAN -- DIFFERENTIATE YOU KNOW

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:11.874
WHEN WE HAVE HERE -- THE

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.809
STATEMENT THAT -- THE COMMISSION

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:15.677
HAS WEAKNESSES IN ITS OVERSIGHT

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.646
CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:20.515
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT TO PERSIST

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:22.050
THAT IMPLIES THAT THERE IS A LOT

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.886
OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT.

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:26.021
I THINK TO THE PUBLIC SO I THINK

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.489
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BE MORE

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:29.358
CLEAR AND HOW WE DEFINE WHAT IS

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.560
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT OR WHAT IS

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:33.128
JUST DECISION MAKING THAT

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.329
LITIGANTS.

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:36.398
DON'T LIKE CAN CAN YOU RESPOND

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:38.734
TO THAT [inaudible]

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.301
YEAH.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:40.736
SO. TO YOUR POINT JUDICIAL

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:42.704
MISCONDUCT IS A VIOLATION OF THE

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:44.506
CODE OF JUDICIAL ETHICS AND ONE

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:46.174
OF THE CORE RESPONSIBILITIES OF

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:48.243
THE INTAKE ATTORNEYS AT C. JP.

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.012
IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:51.780
COMPLAINANT HAS ACTUALLY ALLEGE

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:54.449
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT.

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:55.984
MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS I THINK

01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:58.053
IT'S OVER 90% OF THE COMPLAINTS

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.888
YOU J. P. RECEIVES ARE ACTUALLY

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:01.523
CLOSED IT INTAKE. ONE OF THE

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.058
MAIN REASONS WE SAW FOR THAT IS

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:04.493
BECAUSE THE COMPLAINANT IS NOT

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:06.194
ALLEGING JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:08.463
THEY'RE ALLEGING -- CONCERNED

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.032
WITH THE OUTCOME OF THEIR CASE

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:11.767
IT'S CALLED LEGAL ERROR AND SO

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:13.835
WE DID LOOK INTO THOSE TYPES OF

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:16.371
CASES AND WE HAVE SOME.

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:17.739
RECOMMENDATIONS TO SEE JP ABOUT

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:19.308
TRACKING JUDGES WHO HAVE

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:21.710
CONSISTENTLY RECEIVED COMPLAINTS

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:23.645
ABOUT LEGAL AIR BUT YOU ARE

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:24.947
CORRECT IN THAT MANY OF THE

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.315
COMPLAINTS YOU J. P. RECEIVES

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:27.549
ARE NOT ABOUT JUDICIAL

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:29.384
MISCONDUCT. NINETY PERCENTS

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:30.752
PRETTY HIGH NUMBER NOT JUST MANY

01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:33.055
SO I THINK THE PART OF WHAT WE

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:35.257
NEED TO DO TO IS TO EDUCATE THE

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:35.824
PUBLIC.

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:37.526
OUR END IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:16:37.592 --> 01:16:39.995
THINGS ONLINE I THINK IT'S

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:41.463
IMPORTANT THAT.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.732
THAT WE IDENTIFY CHEST WHAT THE

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:46.568
C. JP'S ROLE IS AND IF THEY ARE

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:48.437
CONCERNED ABOUT A DECISION THAT

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:50.072
THEY SHOULD SEEK COUNSEL LORD

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:51.573
THAT THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:56.712
AVAILABLE. FOR THEM TO PURSUE.

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:57.479
I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:58.480
DEFINING ELEMENT AS WELL IS IT

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:00.282
NOT ABSOLUTELY CENTER JACKSON

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.084
THAT'S WHY WE SKEWS ME HAD THE

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:03.552
RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY NEED TO

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.020
DO A BETTER JOB OF CONDUCTING

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:06.755
OUTREACH TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.090
SO THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:09.424
UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFERENCE

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:11.560
BETWEEN JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT AND

01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:12.728
BEING DISAPPOINTED IN THE

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.763
OUTCOME OF YOUR CASE -- AND WHEN

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.431
WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT SOME OF

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:17.899
THE A LOT OF THE CASES THAT WERE

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.935
CLOSE THE MEN MAJORITY THE CASES

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:21.903
THAT WERE CLOSED WERE FILED BY

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.271
THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THEY WORK.

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:25.374
SUBMITTING INFORMATION THAT WAS

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.608
RELEVANT TO THE JUDICIAL

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:28.744
MISCONDUCT OR VIOLATION OF THE

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.246
CODE YOU JUDICIAL ETHICS -- SO

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.481
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:34.249
NEEDS TO BE GUIDANCE OUT THERE

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:34.883
FOR THE PUBLIC TO REALLY

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.985
UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.453
BETWEEN BETWEEN.

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.788
NOT BEING HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:42.524
OF YOUR CASE AND WHAT REALLY IS --

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:46.461
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT MY LAST

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:49.398
QUESTION AND I DID.

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:53.335
OKAY PLEASE SENATOR RICK CASKEY.

01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:55.937
ON THE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT YOU

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:59.374
HAVE A SECTION.

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:01.376
TALK ABOUT THE INITIAL TAKE

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:02.544
SEEMS TO BE REASONABLE DID YOU

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:09.718
GET INTO A DISCUSSION ON LEGAL

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:14.456
AIR. ONE SEVEN ORALLY.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:17.959
I MANAGING THE COMPLAINT IS THE

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:26.101
INITIAL CASTLE BC BOB.

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:26.835
IT.

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:27.869
WILL BE ALRIGHT JUDICIAL ERROR

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:31.440
IT'S NOT A CONTACT US TODAY

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:45.587
RIGHT -- IS THE PEOPLE OF OUR

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:46.521
TIMES.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.423
THE MOBILE CHURN THAT SHOULD

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:51.193
TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:51.526
TWENTY FIRST.

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:52.661
IT DOESN'T.

01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:54.162
WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT.

01:18:54.229 --> 01:19:00.602
PROBLEM ONE NINETY AND HAVING.

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:03.238
NON LAWYERS IN THE MEMBERS OF

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:04.239
THE PUBLIC LOOK AT THIS.

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:08.343
AIR AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.112
RULES THAT THE CHURCH IF YOU

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:11.546
TALK ABOUT THE INDEPENDENCE OF

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.548
THE JUDICIARY WHEN YOU'RE GOING

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:14.382
TO AT LEAST.

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:16.985
YOU INDICATE THAT THE PROBLEM

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.054
ONE OF THE REQUIRES MEMBERS OF

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:23.158
THE PUBLIC TO BE HERE LOOKING AT

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:28.597
THE YEARS OF LEGAL LEGAL AIR.

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:33.101
HOW OTHER GOOD GREASY ONE NINETY

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:38.507
HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE?

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.342
WE HAVE.

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:42.644
PEOPLE LOOKING AT WHETHER OR YOU

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:45.614
WILL HAVE TO SAY I DON'T KNOW

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.349
WHY I DO THAT.

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:48.016
A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS I THINK

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:48.683
IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION SO

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:49.217
ONE WOULD BE THAT THE THE

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:49.851
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:51.153
COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:52.287
COMMISSION -- DO CURRENTLY

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:52.821
COMPRISE THE MAJORITY THE

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:53.388
COMMISSION THEY'RE NOT DOING

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:54.923
THAT WITHOUT -- JUDGE MEMBERS AN

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.757
ATTORNEY MEMBERS SO THAT'S

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:56.424
THAT'S ONE THE IT'S A DELIBERATE

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:57.492
OF PROCESS THEY ENGAGE IN

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:58.927
DISCUSSION AND AND HOPEFULLY

01:19:58.994 --> 01:19:59.561
THAT DISCUSSIONS EDUCATIONAL TO

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.395
THE COMMISSION MEMBERS WHO MAY

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.763
NOT HAVE -- SPECIFIC TRAINING OR

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:02.531
BACKGROUND.

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:03.498
A SECOND THING THAT WOULD BE

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:06.134
THAT THE TYPE OF DECISIONS THAT

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:08.703
THE COMMISSION MAKES ARE NOT

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:09.704
DECISIONS.

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:10.872
WHETHER TO OVERTURN A JUDICIAL

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:12.340
DECISION OR NOT THAT'S THE

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:13.875
APPELLATE COURT'S ROLE ONLY AN

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:15.210
APPELLATE COURT CAN CHANGE THE

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:16.711
ACTUAL DECISION MADE BY THE

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:18.013
JUDGE IN A PARTICULAR CASE.

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:19.347
WITH THE COMMISSION IS CONCERNED

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:20.415
ABOUT AND WHAT WE NEED THE

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.683
COMMISSION TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:23.451
IS WHETHER A JUDGE HAS ENGAGED

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:25.554
IN SUCH A PERVASIVE PATTERN OF

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.955
MAKING A LEGAL ERROR.

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:28.490
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.225
THAT'S THE DATA THAT WE WANT

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:31.426
THEM COLLECTING IN REVIEWING.

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.395
HAS THIS JUDGE DEMONSTRATED OVER

01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:35.931
OF A CONSISTENT PERVASIVE PERIOD

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:38.433
OF TIME THAT THE JUDGE.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.267
MAY BE ENGAGING IN LEGAL AIR

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.102
THAT INDICATES SOME OTHER FACTOR

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:43.171
INVOLVED BIASES ONE OF THEM IT

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:45.040
COULD ALSO BE -- INCOMPETENT

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:47.175
SOMETHING THAT INDICATES THAT

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:49.377
THIS GOES BEYOND UST -- AN

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:50.745
ERROR CONDUCTED WITH THE FULL

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.747
INTEGRITY AND INTEND TO DO WELL

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:55.383
AT IN THEIR ROLE AS IT AS A

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:57.986
JUDGE -- THE CAP WILL NEED TO

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.221
SET YOU KNOW STANDARDS FOR HOW

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:01.590
IT'S GOING TO TRY AND ESTABLISH

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:02.657
IN A WIN IF WE CROSS THAT

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:04.192
THRESHOLD WHEN WE CROSSED THE

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:06.328
THRESHOLD -- TO AT LEAST OPEN AN

01:21:06.394 --> 01:21:07.696
INVESTIGATION AND ASK FURTHER

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:10.599
QUESTIONS OR WHEN IS THIS JUST --

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:14.469
ISOLATED INSTANCES OF LEGAL AIR

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.203
COMMITTED IN GOOD FAITH.

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.137
WELL BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:17.839
THERE IS WHO DECIDES WHAT'S

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.207
LEGAL ERROR.

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:21.209
USUALLY LEGAL THERE IS DECIDED

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:22.978
BY THE APPELLATE COURT.

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:24.879
SO AND THIS IS A CONCERN IKNOW

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:27.182
WHEN THE PUBLIC IT IT GETS

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:28.783
INVOLVED IN ALL THE LOS THE LAW --

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:31.253
PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE IT

01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:33.321
A IT'S THE JAW THE JOB OF A

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:35.156
JUDGE TO INTERPRET THE LAW TO

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:36.291
APPLY THE LAW.

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:37.692
AND WHEN THE JUDGE DOESN'T TO

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:39.094
WOULD PROPERLY THAT'S WHEN IT

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.163
CASES APPEALED AND OVERTURNED ON

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:42.864
APPEAL SO.

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:44.666
I THINK IT'S A VERY FINE LINE

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.334
HERE AND I THINK PERHAPS WHAT WE

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:48.536
REALLY NEED TO DO IS FOCUS ON

01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:53.508
JUST WHAT JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT IS --

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:54.676
BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.511
CJ PIECE OF ENGAGED IN AND BIAS

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.546
IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE AND I KNOW

01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:00.015
THE COURTS A WITH THEY HAVE A

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:02.517
SYSTEM OF EDUCATION.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.919
WHERE THEY'RE TRYING -- TO

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:06.254
IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:08.290
IMPLICIT BIAS WERE WE ALL HAVE

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:09.791
OUR OWN BIASES AND WE TRY TO

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:11.059
ADDRESS THAT WE'VE GOT

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:11.893
COMMITTEES HERE IN OUR OWN

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.861
BUILDING.

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:15.330
A TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT --

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:16.564
AND PERHAPS THAT'S ANOTHER THING

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:20.235
THAT THE C. JP COULD BE DOING.

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.069
THE BILL INTO CAN'T I THINK IS

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.604
WHICH WHAT FRUSTRATES THE PUBLIC

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:23.705
IS THE NOTION THAT WE OF THESE

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:26.374
BAD ACTORS WHO CONTINUE TO BE

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:29.711
ABLE -- TO TO RULE THROUGH THE

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:32.314
JUDICIAL PROCESS WITH IMPUNITY.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.650
I THINK THAT'S WHAT PROP.

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.352
NINE ONE NINETY I TRY TO ADDRESS.

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:39.254
MY QUESTION THOUGH GOING FORWARD

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:40.155
HERE IS.

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:42.357
IN THE PROCESS IN THE

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:44.292
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS MY

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.094
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT FREQUENTLY

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:47.996
JUDGES ONLY LEARNED THAT AN

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:50.432
INVESTIGATION HAS TAKEN PLACE.

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:52.834
AFTER IT'S DETERMINED THAT THE

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:56.137
COMPLAINT IS JUSTIFIED.

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:59.007
AND I AM WONDERING.

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:01.443
IN THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATING.

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:03.578
ARE IS THERE ANY EFFORT MADE AS

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.480
YOU SAW TO ACTUALLY INTERVIEW

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:08.249
THE JUDGE.

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:08.750
AND AND TO ADDRESS THE

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.553
ALLEGATIONS. TO GET THE COURTS

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:13.588
PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THESE

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.557
ALLEGATIONS ARE.

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:17.359
I I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SOME

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:19.594
JUDGES THEY'VE GOTTEN BLINDSIDED

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.663
GET IS A LETTER PLEASE APPEAR

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:24.065
YOU BEEN ACUSED OF X. Y. AND Z.

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:26.935
WE FIND THAT THERE'S OF THAT YOU

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:28.136
KNOW THAT IT'S A VALID OR THEIR

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:30.138
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO INDICATE

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.806
THIS BEHAVIOR.

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:33.341
WHAT DO YOU SAY AND IF YOU DON'T

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.377
LIKE IT YOU CAN HAVE A PUBLIC

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:36.911
HEARINGS WHICH I SUSPECT FOR

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:38.713
MANY JUDGES IS NOT AN OPTION

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.948
BECAUSE?

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:40.415
PARTICULARLY IN SMALL

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:42.484
COMMUNITIES THAT COULD BE THE

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:43.685
END OF THEIR CAREER.

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:46.688
AND MY CONCERN IS THAT IT MIGHT

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:47.856
IMPACT THEIR ABILITY.

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:51.292
TO DISPENSE JUSTICE AS THEY

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:52.761
LEGITIMATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:54.129
FEEL IS APPROPRIATE SO COULD YOU

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:56.064
RESPOND TO THAT.

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:59.734
YES -- SO WE DID SEE CJ P..

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:01.035
CONTACTING JUDGES DURING

01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:02.604
INVESTIGATIONS NOT NECESSARILY

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:03.705
IN AN IN PERSON INTERVIEW BUT

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.673
THEY WILL SEND LETTERS USUALLY

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.075
AFTER CONDUCTING SOME

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:08.476
INVESTIGATIVE WORK BELIEVE IT

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:09.778
WAS TWENTY ONE OF THE THIRTY

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:11.780
CASES WE REVIEWED THEY CONTACTED

01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:12.380
THE JUDGE.

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:13.448
AND WHEN THEY CONTACT THE JUDGE

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:14.682
THEY'RE LAYING OUT WHAT THE

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.518
ALLEGATION IS WHAT EVIDENCE

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:17.986
THEY'VE COLLECTED TO THAT POINT

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:19.487
AND BASICALLY ASKING THE JUDGE

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:20.655
FOR THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:23.491
ALLEGATION.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.392
IF THE JUDGE PROVIDES THEM WITH

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.527
ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OR INFIRM.

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:26.428
THE COMMISSION CAN MAKE THE

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:28.129
DECISION TO NOT MOVE FORWARD

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:29.731
WITH THAT CASE AND CLOSE THAT

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:31.299
CASE WITHOUT DISCIPLINE AND WE

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:32.934
SAW THAT HAPPEN IN SOME OF THE

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:36.771
CASES THAT WE REVIEWED -- DO YOU

01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:38.473
HAVE ANYTHING.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.974
SB DIDN'T SEE ANY INSTANCES OF

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:42.277
JUDGES BEING CALLED.

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:43.778
TO APPEAR WITHOUT ANY

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.547
OPPORTUNITY DATE DO EXACTLY WHAT

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:46.815
WAS CRAZINESS ALSO EXPLAINED IN

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.149
AN I THINK IT'S A THE FINAL

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:49.284
THING THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:50.318
THE INSTANCES WHERE WE SAW

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:51.920
JUDGES WERE NOT CONTACTED IT'S

01:24:51.986 --> 01:24:53.188
BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DECIDED

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:54.556
THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE TO THE

01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:55.557
ALLEGATIONS.

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:56.791
SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH DISCIPLINE

01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:58.526
JUST HAPPENED OUT OF NO WHERE IN

01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:00.128
THOSE NINE INSTANCES WHERE THE

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:00.962
JUDGES NEVER CONTACTED IS

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:01.796
ACTUALLY.

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.465
THERE'S NOT EVEN A POINTS TO

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:04.866
CONTACTING TO THE JUDGE HERE

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.869
THERE'S NOTHING TO TO DISCUSS

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:09.571
ANY FURTHER.

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:12.240
SENATOR MONNING THANK YOU.

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.808
THANK YOU A MADAM CHAIR.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:16.544
WELL I WANT TO START BY THANKING --

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:20.215
THE AUDITOR AND YOUR TEAM -- FOR

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:22.116
ASSEMBLING WHAT I THINK IS VERY

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.219
USEFUL.

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:26.588
AUDIT AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:25:26.654 --> 01:25:28.857
THAT PROVIDE US THE OPPORTUNITY

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:31.259
TO PROVE. TO ENGAGE IN ARE BOTH

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:33.361
APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:35.830
POTENTIALLY ON OUR FUTURE

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:40.168
LEGISLATIVE ROLE IN IN SEEKING.

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:42.570
TO FIND. TO THE PURSUE SOME OF

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.739
THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:48.042
A QUESTION IN TERMS ONE OF THE

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:50.144
RECOMMENDATIONS IS.

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:52.881
NO ABILITY TO FILE AN ELECTRONIC

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:54.215
COMPLAINT.

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:56.818
IN THE CURRENT COMPLAINT PROCESS

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:58.419
IS THERE ANY BASIS FOR AN

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.555
ATTORNEY OR A COURT ROOM STAFF

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.557
TO FILE AN ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:04.158
OR DO THEY HAVE TO ATTACH THEIR

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:06.794
NAME. TO THE COMPLAINT FOR TO BE

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:09.831
ACTED UPON.

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:11.866
WE SAW INDIVIDUALS WHO SUBMITTED

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:13.535
ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS CGP

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:15.370
RECOMMENDS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.437
COMPLAINING ATTACHED THEIR NAME

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.106
SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP IF IT DOES

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:19.974
CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION TO GET

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:21.676
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- BUT

01:26:21.743 --> 01:26:23.111
THERE IS AN OPTION OF FILING

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:24.579
ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS.

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:26.214
IN AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ONE OF THE

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:27.682
PROBLEMS.

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:29.050
FOR AN OFFICER OF THE COURT AN

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:33.021
ATTORNEY. TO FILE A COMPLAINT IN

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:33.321
[inaudible]

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:35.156
AGAINST.

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:37.191
A SITTING JUDGE IN THEIR

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:38.426
JURISDICTION.

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:41.062
IS A FEAR OF RETALIATION.

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:43.031
IN A FROM A DUE PROCESS POINT OF

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:44.532
VIEW IF A COMPLAINT MOVES

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:46.601
FORWARD I CAN SEE THE IMPORTANCE

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:48.770
OF THE ACCUSED.

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.104
HAVING THE ABILITY.

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:53.141
TO IF NOT DIRECTLY CROSS EXAMINE

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:53.908
TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:55.610
COMPLAINTS COMING FROM.

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:58.947
RESPOND TO IT -- BUT I'VE HEARD

01:26:59.013 --> 01:26:59.981
FROM.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:02.383
PRACTICING ATTORNEYS WITH

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:05.186
PROBLEMS OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT.

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:07.021
AND I I I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:09.824
CONCERN OF MAYBE A GRAY AREA BUT

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:11.726
I WOULD THINK IN THE ORIENTATION

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:14.295
OF THE INVESTIGATIVE -- PANEL

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:15.730
WHETHER IT'S A STAFF

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:17.231
INVESTIGATOR WAR WAR

01:27:17.298 --> 01:27:19.634
COMMISSIONERS.

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:22.270
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT IS DIFFERENT

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:24.172
THAN DISSATISFACTION WITH A

01:27:24.238 --> 01:27:27.108
LEGAL OPINION -- YOU HAVE

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:28.543
YELLING AT LITIGANTS

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:30.878
RELATIONSHIP WITH A SUBORDINATE

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:32.580
IN THE COURT ROOM.

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:34.215
IMPROPERLY BARRING ENTRY TO THE

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:36.150
COURTROOM DELEGATING JUDICIAL

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:39.120
ROLE TO CLERKS THREATENING TO

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:40.888
ASSAULT LITIGANTS.

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:43.791
THAT'S JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT.

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:45.526
THAT THAT DOESN'T TURN ON HOW

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:48.329
THEY DECIDED IN THE CASE IN

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:50.765
FRONT OF THEM -- SO IF THERE'S

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:54.135
ANY.

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:55.336
GRAY AREA -- LACK OF

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:56.904
UNDERSTANDING IT SEEMS LIKE WE

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:58.806
JUST HAVE TO READ.

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:02.076
JUDICIAL ETHICS REQUIREMENTS.

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:03.111
AND HAVE THAT BE PART OF THE

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:05.947
ORIENTATION PROCESS BUT BACK TO

01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:09.384
THE QUESTION OF IF YOU EXPAND

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:09.651
EDUCATION.

01:28:09.717 --> 01:28:11.085
PUBLIC.

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:12.453
I WOULD AGREE THAT PART OF THAT

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.589
HAS TO BE PART OF THAT EDUCATION

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.391
WHAT DOES CONSTITUTE JUDICIAL

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.592
MISCONDUCT.

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:18.993
MY GUESS IS THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.195
INMATES IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS

01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:22.497
WHO BELIEVE.

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:24.465
THEY WEREN'T TREATED

01:28:24.532 --> 01:28:27.402
APPROPRIATELY BASED ON A FINDING

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:29.037
OF GUILT IN A SENTENCING TO

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:30.138
STATE PRISON.

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:32.073
DOESN'T MEAN THERE WAS JUST

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.941
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT.

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:39.213
BUT FOR THESE EXAMPLES.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.882
IN IN VOTE INVOLVED IN ELEVEN

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.483
COMPLAINTS THAT WERE NOT

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:44.352
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED TO ME

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:45.486
THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT'S IN

01:28:45.553 --> 01:28:48.322
FRONT OF US TODAY AND THAT'S

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:49.791
WHERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS GO.

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:51.826
IN MAYBE NOT FOR DISCUSSION

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:53.361
TODAY BUT THIS.

01:28:53.428 --> 01:28:58.099
THE ABILITY TO FILE ANONYMOUSLY --

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.168
BUT STILL BE CONTACTED

01:29:00.234 --> 01:29:02.837
POTENTIALLY BY INVESTIGATORS SO

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:04.739
IN OTHER WORDS YOUR NAME.

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:06.507
COULD YOUR NAME BE MADE

01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:08.042
AVAILABLE IN THE COMPLAINT.

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:10.645
BUT NOT NECESSARILY SHARED WITH

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:13.614
THE JUDICIAL OFFICER AGAINST TO

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:15.183
THE COMPLAINTS BEING MADE

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.918
WITHOUT.

01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:19.721
THE STAFF INVESTIGATOR SEEKING.

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:21.155
THAT AUTHORIZATION FROM THE

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:23.458
COMPLAINANT THE COMPLAINANT MAY

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:25.259
RATHER WITHDRAW THEIR COMPLAINT.

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:27.095
THEN HAVE A GO FORWARD WITH THE

01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:28.129
JUDGE.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.931
KNOWING THAT THERE THE ONE

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:23.804
EIGHT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN

01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:26.040
REGARDS TO THE BICAMERAL SYSTEM

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:28.376
I THINK THAT -- PROBABLY THE WAY

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:31.078
THAT WE NEED TO TO MOVE ON THIS

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:35.616
AND AND THE THE NEED FOR A

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:37.285
ROBUST INTAKE SYSTEM -- I DON'T

01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:38.452
THINK THE PUBLIC HAS A CLUE

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:40.221
QUITE FRANKLY I PRACTICE TWENTY

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:41.389
FIVE YEARS IN THE COURT NEVER

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:42.890
SAW ANYTHING THAT INVITES ME.

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:45.993
HOW TO MAKE A COMPLAINT -- AND

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.828
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:50.431
IDEA IN SOME OF THE CASES --

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:52.767
JUST BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET YOU

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:54.235
TO CHAU TEMPERAMENT IS SO

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:57.004
IMPORTANT IN IN IN.

01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:59.840
THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PUBLIC BUT

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:02.343
ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS IN AND

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.412
MAYBE YOU COULD -- ELUCIDATE A

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:07.815
LITTLE BIT IS MY CONCERN WITH

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:10.918
THE TIME THAT IT TOOK.

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:13.321
MANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS --

01:33:13.387 --> 01:33:15.456
IS IT AN ISSUE OF MONEY.

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:17.158
OR IS IT AN ISSUE I MEAN I MEAN

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:19.126
EVERYTHING IS RECORDED IN IN

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:21.195
MOST OF THE COURTS -- IT'S

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:22.730
EITHER RECORDED OR THERE'S A

01:33:22.797 --> 01:33:25.533
REPORTER AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:26.934
INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:28.369
COMPLAINING ABOUT A JUDGE YOU'D

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.638
THINK I'D BE FAIRLY SIMPLE.

01:33:30.705 --> 01:33:32.540
TO PULL UP THAT INFORMATION OR

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:33.074
TO GET.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:35.476
THE WHICH WHO WHOEVER WAS.

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:37.044
IN THE COURTROOM AT THE TIME TO

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:38.245
GET INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S ALL

01:33:38.312 --> 01:33:41.015
ON THE DOCKET AND SO I'M

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:43.584
WONDERING -- I'M WONDERING THAT

01:33:43.651 --> 01:33:46.487
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS --

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.389
IT'S REALLY CLEAR TO ME THAT THE

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:50.091
SYSTEM HAS TO INCLUDE A TRACKING

01:33:50.157 --> 01:33:51.759
SYSTEM AS WELL SO THAT THE

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.694
INVESTIGATORS CAN GO BACKWARDS

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:55.229
AND LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S BEEN

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:57.598
A HISTORY OF COMPLAINTS.

01:33:57.665 --> 01:34:01.569
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO THAT --

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:04.438
IT'S IT'S NOT ONLY.

01:34:04.505 --> 01:34:06.540
THAT WE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.376
BEHAVIOR FROM.

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:11.879
FROM -- THE DECISIONS THAT THE

01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:13.347
RENDERING.

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:16.517
IT APPEARS TO ME IN THE RESEARCH

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:17.985
THAT YOU DID THAT.

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:20.121
LEGAL ERROR.

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:22.623
IS IT IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:23.858
THE LEGAL HEIR TO FIGURE OUT IF

01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:25.059
THERE'S AN IN INHERENT BIAS.

01:34:25.126 --> 01:34:27.128
THE THE THE JUDGES EXHIBITING AS

01:34:27.194 --> 01:34:29.296
WELL AND IN THE ONLY WAY YOU GET

01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:30.598
THERE IS IF THE IF YOU'RE

01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:32.666
LOOKING AT A TRACKING SYSTEM

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:34.502
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GO BACK AND

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:35.436
SEE WHO'S COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:37.538
AND AND IS IT A PATTERN OVER

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:39.073
PEER TYPE SO I'M WONDERING IF

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:39.240
YOU.

01:34:39.306 --> 01:34:40.341
COULD COMMENT ON BOTH OF THOSE

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:41.909
THOSE ISSUE AND BOTH OF THOSE BY

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:43.677
THE WAY RELATE TO MONEY AND

01:34:43.744 --> 01:34:45.179
THAT'S WHY.

01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:47.882
WHY AM QUé I'M FOCUSED ON THAT?

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:49.383
SO WITH REGARD TO THE TIMELINESS

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:50.885
OF INVESTIGATIONS AS I MENTIONED

01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:51.986
JUST A MOMENT AGO THERE ARE

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.187
TIMES WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

01:34:53.254 --> 01:34:54.855
AN INVESTIGATION FROM ABSOLUTE

01:34:54.922 --> 01:34:56.524
START ABSOLUTE FINISH MAYBE

01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:57.324
TAKES.

01:34:57.391 --> 01:34:59.126
LONGER THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT AND

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:00.628
THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:02.563
INTENTIONALLY DELAYED -- AS I

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.431
MENTIONED BEFORE THERE MAY BE

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:05.332
GOOD REASONS TO DO THAT IN

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:06.634
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:07.968
OUR KEY CONCERN WITH THE

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:09.804
TIMELINESS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:10.905
THOUGH IS THAT THEY WEREN'T AS

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:12.106
SIEGE OF HE'S NOT.

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:14.742
EVEN BOTHERING OR HASN'T BEEN

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:17.111
IDENTIFYING -- AN EXPECTED

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:18.646
LENGTH OF INVESTIGATION THOSE

01:35:18.712 --> 01:35:20.748
INVESTIGATIVE STRATEGIES THAT WE

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:22.349
WERE TALKING ABOUT A MOMENT AGO --

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:24.018
ARE SORT OF THE FIRST INDICATOR

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:25.586
FOR WHETHER THERE'D -- MOVING

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:26.620
THROUGH THE INVESTIGATIONS

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:27.788
QUICKLY ENOUGH WE'RE NOT SEEING

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:28.823
THEM PRE PLANNING THOSE

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:30.257
INVESTIGATIONS THESE ARE THE

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.593
STEPS I'M GOING TO TAKE IN ABOUT

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:33.227
HOW LONG I THINK BEFORE I'LL BE

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.962
DONE -- THAT'S THE IMPORTANT

01:35:35.029 --> 01:35:36.430
FIRST STEP IN MAKING SURE THE

01:35:36.497 --> 01:35:39.934
INVESTIGATIONS PROCEED IN A

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.635
TIMELY FASHION.

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:42.903
OUR TO COLLECTING THE DATA YES I

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:45.239
AM A MORE SUBSTANTIVE -- DATA

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:46.941
SYSTEM WILL ALLOW THEM TO START

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:48.776
TRACKING A MORE SUBSTANTIVE DATA

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:51.545
SYSTEM AND BETTER PRACTICES WITH

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:53.013
CODING THEIR COMPLAINTS SO.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.715
WE DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT THE

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:56.684
LEGAL ERROR CASES WERE NOT BEING

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.385
TRACKED APPROPRIATELY EVEN IN

01:35:58.452 --> 01:36:00.254
THE EXISTING SYSTEM. TO SEE JP

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:02.089
SHOULD SHORE UP ITS PRACTICES

01:36:02.156 --> 01:36:03.757
FOR CODING COMPLAINTS BUT ONCE

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:05.326
THEY HAVE A NEW SYSTEM IT'LL BE

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:08.028
A FAR LESS LABOR INTENSIVE

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:09.797
PROCESS FOR THEM TO RUN TRENDING.

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:11.499
TO LOOK BACKWARDS AND THEN SEE

01:36:11.565 --> 01:36:13.934
IF LEGAL AIR IS AS I MENTIONED

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:15.636
EARLIER ISOLATED --

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:17.905
UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE IT'S

01:36:17.972 --> 01:36:19.073
SOMETHING COMMITTED IN GOOD

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.008
FAITH WITHOUT L. INTENT OR

01:36:21.075 --> 01:36:22.176
WHETHER IT'S INDICATIVE OF A

01:36:22.243 --> 01:36:23.511
PATTERN THAT ACTUALLY

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:27.414
CONSTITUTES MISCONDUCT.

01:36:27.481 --> 01:36:28.916

BETWEEN -- COMPLAINTS --

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:43.164
DIRECTED TOWARD JUDGES WHO ARE

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:45.166
ELECTED RATHER THAN APPOINTED.

01:36:45.232 --> 01:36:46.667
WE DID THAT TYPE OF AN ANALYSIS

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.869
AND WE FOUND NO CORRELATION OF

01:36:48.936 --> 01:36:51.338
AMONG THE OUTCOME OF COMPLAINTS.

01:36:51.405 --> 01:36:54.108
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEPENDENT OF

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:54.675
IF THE JUDGE WAS ELECTED OR

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:56.710
APPOINTED LITTLE [inaudible]

01:36:56.777 --> 01:36:58.946

JUST A QUICK QUESTION ON PAGE.

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:10.624
FIFTY ONE ON THE THE SIDE PANEL

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:12.593
IT SAYS WHEN INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:13.961
WERE NOT ATTORNEY SUBMITTED

01:37:14.028 --> 01:37:16.130
COMPLAINTS C. J. P. WAS NEARLY

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:18.332
50% MORE LIKELY TO CLOSE THE

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:20.634
COMPLAINTS WITHOUT PERFORMING AN

01:37:20.701 --> 01:37:21.869
INVESTIGATION.

01:37:21.936 --> 01:37:23.270
COMPARED TO WHEN ATTORNEYS

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:24.972

01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:26.106
SURFACE.

01:37:26.173 --> 01:37:28.576
FROM OF A LAY PERSON'S VIEWPOINT

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:30.077
THAT WOULD TELL ME IT'S A

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:32.446
STACKED DECK UNLESS YOU'RE

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:35.549
WITHIN THE THE PROFESSION YOU'RE

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:37.451
NOT GOING TO GET A HEARING.

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:38.152
NOW.

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:40.254
WE'RE SENATOR JACKSON'S POINTS

AND OTHER POINTS.

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:43.490
BEING MADE.

01:37:43.557 --> 01:37:44.291
THERE.

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:47.027
MUST BE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:37:47.094 --> 01:37:49.830
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT AND SIMPLY.

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:51.999
SOUR GRAPES ABOUT YOUR OUTCOME

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:54.068
SO IT WAS THAT WHY YOU PUT THIS

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:56.103
IN HERE.

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:58.806
I'M I'M JUST A HAZY ON IT NO

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:00.140
THIS IS TO SO.

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:02.142
WE FOUND THIS FACT IN SUPPORT OF

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:03.510
OUR CONCLUSION THAT CJ BE COULD

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:05.012
BE DOING MORE TO EDUCATE PEOPLE

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:07.815
ABOUT WHAT JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:09.250
IS AND ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION IT

01:38:09.316 --> 01:38:10.284
NEEDS TO SUBMIT.

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:11.719
ORDER FOR ITS COMPLAINT TO BE

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:13.587
FORWARDED ON TO AN INVESTIGATION --

01:38:13.654 --> 01:38:14.722
CERTAINLY AS WE KNOW IN THE

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:16.056
REPORT ON THIS PAGE THERE ARE

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:19.360
REASONS WHY -- ATTORNEYS FOR A

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:20.160
PEOPLE WHO ARE AROUND THE

01:38:20.227 --> 01:38:21.762
COURTHOUSE IS MORE OFTEN THAN

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:24.064
THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD BE MADE.

01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:25.499
THEY MAY JUST OBSERVE JUDICIAL

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:26.900
MISCONDUCT MORE FREQUENTLY DUE

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:29.003
TO THAT PROXIMITY BUT WE DO

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:29.937
THINK THAT THIS INDICATES THAT

01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:31.405
CGP COULD BE DOING MORE TO

01:38:31.472 --> 01:38:33.173
EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC AGAIN

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.209
AS I SAID WHAT IS MISCONDUCT.

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:36.944
AND ALSO WHAT INFORMATION DOES

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:38.679
IT NEED OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:39.847
SPECIFICALLY IS IN THE DIRECTION

01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:41.949
OF PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF WHAT A

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:42.850
HIGH QUALITY COMPLAINT LOOKS

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:43.584
LIKE.

01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:44.985
INDICATE CLEARLY THAT YOU DO

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:46.787
WANT -- INDIVIDUALS TO SUBMIT

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.289
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION IF THEY

01:38:48.355 --> 01:38:49.556
DO HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW THE

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:51.892
WEBSITES MORE SUGGESTIVE THAN IT

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:53.127
IS IN ON SORT OF REALLY SAYING

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:54.395
YES GIVE THAT TO US.

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:55.329
SO THAT'S WHY WE MADE THIS

01:38:55.396 --> 01:38:57.598
OBSERVATION IS IN SUPPORT OF

01:38:57.665 --> 01:38:59.266
BETTER PUBLIC EDUCATION

01:38:59.333 --> 01:38:59.566
[inaudible]

01:38:59.633 --> 01:39:00.401
THE TEACHER.

01:39:00.467 --> 01:39:02.069
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:03.537
WHEN.

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.039
LAWYERS AND THOSE AROUND THE

01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:06.707
COURTHOUSE ACTUALLY LODGE A

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:07.875
COMPLAINT.

01:39:07.941 --> 01:39:09.877
HE DO SO BECAUSE OF THEY DO SO

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:11.011
AT THEIR OWN PERIL.

01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:12.546
IN MANY RESPECTS THAT'S WHERE

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:13.714
THEY DO THE THAT'S WHERE THEY

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.449
CONDUCT THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND IF

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:16.717
THE COURT.

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.085
WERE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THAT

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:19.753
WHICH IS WHY I APPRECIATE THAT

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.823
THERE IS SOME ANONYMITY -- IT

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:23.891
COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT.

01:39:23.957 --> 01:39:25.592
ON THE OTHER HAND.

01:39:25.659 --> 01:39:28.128
THE QUESTION ABOUT WHEN YOU

01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:31.465
ENGAGE THE COURT TO DIRECTLY

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:33.000
INQUIRE -- FOR EXAMPLE A

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.768
COMPLAINT HASBEEN LARGE THAT%

01:39:34.835 --> 01:39:38.572
YOU CONTINUALLY HARASS -- JURY

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:41.575
PANELS AND DEMEAN THEM WHAT IS

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:44.511
YOUR PROCESS WHAT ARE YOU DOING.

01:39:44.578 --> 01:39:46.947
I WONDER IF IF WE ENGAGE THE

01:39:47.014 --> 01:39:48.916
COURTS EARLIER WE MIGHT NOT BE

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:51.552
ABLE TO REMEDY THAT BEHAVIOR

01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:53.587
PARTICULARLY IF WE NOW ADD TO

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:56.357

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:58.225
ABILITY TO DO THAT EDUCATION AND

01:39:58.292 --> 01:39:59.293
TRAINING.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.395
OUR THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:02.663
WILL HELP.

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:04.732
I I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IT IN IT

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:06.367
HAPPENS IN MANY PROFESSIONS YOU

01:40:06.433 --> 01:40:07.935

01:40:22.049 --> 01:40:23.417
DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD SO I

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:27.020

01:43:01.575 --> 01:43:04.511
THAT -- DICK CONFIDENTIALITY

01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:07.781
SERVES AT LEAST TWO IMPORTANT

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:09.583
PURPOSES ONE IT PROTECTS THE

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:10.851
IDENTITY.

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:12.519
PLANETS AND WITNESSES WHO MIGHT

NOT OTHERWISE COMPLAIN TO THE

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:14.855
COMMISSION.

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:17.357
IT ALSO ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:18.625
OBTAIN.

FALSE RUMORS ABOUT JUDGES IT

01:43:37.678 --> 01:43:39.079

COMMISSION'S PROCESS IN IT ALSO

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:44.217

CAN I I WANNA JUST PAUSE BRIEFLY

ON THE NOTION OF A

01:49:31.564 --> 01:49:35.568
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND I I

01:49:35.635 --> 01:49:37.370
I THINK THAT I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN

01:49:37.437 --> 01:49:38.104
THE WRONG IMPRESSION IN MY

01:49:38.171 --> 01:49:38.638
LETTER.

01:49:38.705 --> 01:49:40.106
IN TERMS OF AMENDING THE

01:49:40.173 --> 01:49:42.909
CONSTITUTION -- WE USED.

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:43.910
THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:45.879
THAT'S A POLICY DECISION FOR THE

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:47.480
LEGISLATURE AND ULTIMATELY THE

01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:51.151
VOTERS TO MAKE -- HI MY PLEASE

01:49:51.217 --> 01:49:53.186
IS THAT THAT BE SOMETHING THAT

IS DONE WITH PRECISION AND CARE.

01:49:56.756 --> 01:49:58.892
BECAUSE IF IT'S GOING TO BE A

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:01.127
VERY BIG OVERHAUL OF THE

01:50:01.194 --> 01:50:02.796
COMMISSION AND THE WAY THAT IT

01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:05.665
DOES ITS WORK -- I'D I JUST

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:07.767
THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:09.836
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE COME TO THE

01:50:09.903 --> 01:50:11.938

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:13.006
THROUGH.

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:15.275
WHAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:18.445
AMENDMENT WILL -- WILL SAY AND

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:22.148
THE RESULTS THAT IT WILL -- THAT

01:50:22.215 --> 01:50:25.919
IT WILL GET -- MY WHAT I

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:28.288
DISPUTED -- NOT THE AMENDMENT

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:30.824
ITSELF MY DISPUTE WAS WITH THE

01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:32.125
COMMENT THAT THERE WAS A DUE

01:50:32.192 --> 01:50:33.493
PROCESS PROBLEM WITH THE

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.928
COMMISSION'S CURRENT STRUCTURE I

01:50:34.995 --> 01:50:37.530
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A

01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:40.300
DUE PROCESS PROBLEM WITH THE

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:41.167
COMMISSION'S CURRENT STRUCTURE.

01:50:41.234 --> 01:50:42.535

HAVE TO BE PROVIDED TO JUDGES

01:50:46.573 --> 01:50:47.974
WHO ARE IN THE PROCESS IS.

BICAMERAL AGENCY.

01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:03.102
THE COMMISSION ITSELF DOESN'T

01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:04.871

AN UNUSUAL SITUATION AS WELL

01:58:56.963 --> 01:58:58.731
BECAUSE I LIVE WITHIN ONE

01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:00.132
HUNDRED MILES OF THE

01:59:00.199 --> 01:59:01.300

PEOPLE OUT A A RICH DOING THIS

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:28.594
BUT I DO THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE

01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:30.363
SOME FORM OF COMPETITION I GET I

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:30.630
MEAN WHAT.

01:59:30.696 --> 01:59:32.698
HOW WHY IS IT THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:33.466
COMPENSATED WHAT'S THE WHAT'S

01:59:33.533 --> 01:59:35.501
THE IS THERE LEGAL BARRIERS IS

01:59:35.568 --> 01:59:37.003
JUST PRACTICES?

01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:40.706
SO IT'S BEEN THAT WAY -- FOREVER

01:59:40.773 --> 01:59:44.143
AS FAR AS I KNOW AND THEN THE

01:59:44.210 --> 01:59:44.777
AND THEN THE OTHER REASON WOULD

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:46.312
BE BUDGETARY.

01:59:46.379 --> 01:59:47.813
SIR SURE.

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:49.148
OKAY WHY I GUESS I WOULD JUST

01:59:49.215 --> 01:59:51.150
SAY IF IT YOU KNOW AS WELL AS IT

01:59:51.217 --> 01:59:52.552
WAS THIS CONSIDERED AT ALL BY

01:59:52.618 --> 01:59:53.786
THE AUDIT.

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:55.187
HE COULD HEAR FROM ONE OF YOU

01:59:55.254 --> 02:00:03.062
ABOUT. TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS.

02:00:03.129 --> 02:00:04.530
SO AGAIN BOB HARRIS WITH THE

02:00:04.597 --> 02:00:06.299
STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I'M THE

02:00:06.365 --> 02:00:07.033
ONE AREA IN WHICH WE

02:00:07.099 --> 02:00:07.967
SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:09.502
COMPENSATION WAS WITH OUR

02:00:09.569 --> 02:00:11.370
PROPOSAL. TO HAVE THE COMMISSION

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:13.272
HERE AT SOME CASES AND IT WAS

02:00:13.339 --> 02:00:14.740
BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THE

02:00:14.807 --> 02:00:16.242
COMMISSION HAD EXPRESSED TO US

02:00:16.309 --> 02:00:17.476
ABOUT THE UNCOMPENSATED NATURE

02:00:17.543 --> 02:00:20.379
OF THE COMMISSIONERS -- SO WE

02:00:20.446 --> 02:00:21.380
THEIR OWN CASES WOULD MEAN SO

02:00:21.447 --> 02:00:22.982
WHERE IN THE STRUCTURE THAT

02:00:23.049 --> 02:00:24.417
WE'RE PROPOSING INSTEAD OF USING

02:00:24.483 --> 02:00:26.252
THE SPECIAL MASTERS TO REVIEW TO

02:00:26.319 --> 02:00:27.520
HOLD THE EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS

02:00:27.587 --> 02:00:28.854
THE COMMISSIONERS THEMSELVES

02:00:28.921 --> 02:00:30.623
WHAT ACTUALLY SET FOR THE

02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:32.224
EVIDENTIARY HEARING THEMSELVES.

02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:34.060
TO US THAT WAS AN EXTRA ASK IT'S

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:35.194
SOMETHING THE COMMISSIONERS ARE

02:00:35.261 --> 02:00:37.663
NOT CURRENTLY DOING RIGHT -- SO

02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:39.865
WE DEVELOPED A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF

02:00:39.932 --> 02:00:40.066
WHAT.

02:00:40.132 --> 02:00:41.500
MY MISSION PACKAGER LOOK LIKE TO

02:00:41.567 --> 02:00:42.702
PAY THEM FOR THEIR TIME TO DO

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:44.770
THAT SO THAT SPECIFIC THING FOR

02:00:44.837 --> 02:00:46.505
THAT SPECIFIC THING NOT FOR THE

02:00:46.572 --> 02:00:47.607
REGULAR SERVICE THAT THEY'RE

02:00:47.673 --> 02:00:49.208
CURRENTLY CONDUCTING THAT'S THE

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:50.309
EXTENT TO WHICH WE LOOKED AT

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:50.910
COMPENSATION.

02:00:50.977 --> 02:00:52.211
THAT'S SIX INTO WHICH THAT'S THE

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:54.880
EXTENT TO WHICH WE LOOKED AT

02:00:54.947 --> 02:00:56.449
COMPENSATION A HIGH -- DO YOU

02:00:56.515 --> 02:00:57.083
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE BAT

02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:58.951
BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT.

02:00:59.018 --> 02:01:00.019
BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE DIDN'T

02:01:00.086 --> 02:01:01.587
KNOW PINE ON WHETHER THERE

02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:02.154
SHOULD BE A CHANGE TO THE

02:01:02.221 --> 02:01:03.556
CONVERSATION THE FACT THAT

02:01:03.623 --> 02:01:04.824
THEY'RE CURRENTLY UNCOMPENSATED

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.726
I UNDERSTAND YOU DIDN'T DO THEIR

02:01:06.792 --> 02:01:08.394
PART BUT WOULD YOU OPINE.

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:09.495
WE HAVE NO RECOMMENDATION IN

02:01:09.562 --> 02:01:10.396
THAT AREA OKAY.

02:01:10.463 --> 02:01:13.766
THANK YOU.

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:15.167
THANK YOU.

02:01:15.234 --> 02:01:16.369
IN THE OFFENSE AT THAT IS AN

02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:19.572
ISSUE. TO WORK ON BY THAT'S

02:01:19.639 --> 02:01:21.941
REALLY MINOR IN THE CONTEXT OF

02:01:22.008 --> 02:01:23.309
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:01:23.376 --> 02:01:25.011
HERE AND PERHAPS IF WE COME UP

02:01:25.077 --> 02:01:26.912
WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:01:26.979 --> 02:01:28.147
CONFERENCE OF A PACKAGE WE THAT

02:01:28.214 --> 02:01:29.582
MAY BE SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT

02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:31.250
BUT YOU'RE ALSO TALKING TO A

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:32.618
GROUP OF LEGISLATORS WHO'VE.

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:33.753
DONE LOTS OF THINGS ON A

02:01:33.819 --> 02:01:35.521
VOLUNTARY BASIS I WAS A COASTAL

02:01:35.588 --> 02:01:37.423
COMMISSIONER WHICH TOOK MORE

02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:39.191
THAN A QUARTER OF MY TIME.

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:40.860
UNCOMPENSATED SO THERE ARE

02:01:40.926 --> 02:01:42.428
THINGS THAT WE DO BECAUSE WE

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:44.063
NEED TO AND THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:46.332
FUNCTION BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:48.100
BUT ON ON THE BUDGET THE OTHER

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:49.669
DID MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON

02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:50.703
SOME FUNDING INTO THE

02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:52.772
LEGISLATURE SHOULD DO THIS

02:01:52.838 --> 02:01:53.739
LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT.

02:01:53.806 --> 02:01:55.741
AS WAYS FUNDING PROBLEM WITH

02:01:55.808 --> 02:01:58.177
THAT IS IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

02:01:58.244 --> 02:01:59.378
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WE TEND TO

02:01:59.445 --> 02:02:00.813
THROW MONEY OVER THE WALL IN THE

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:03.182
JUDICIAL BRANCH SPENDS ITS MONEY.

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:05.618
AND BEFORE WE COME UP WITH LINE

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.553
ITEM RECOMMENDATIONS I WANT TO

02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:09.488
MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM

02:02:09.555 --> 02:02:11.223
BROADER.

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:12.391
DOESN'T ALREADY HAVE THE

02:02:12.458 --> 02:02:14.326
CAPACITY TO DO THIS WHAT'S BEING

02:02:14.393 --> 02:02:15.861
ASKED IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY.

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:17.997
POTENTIALLY AND THERE ARE POTS

02:02:18.064 --> 02:02:19.398
OF MONEY IN THINGS THAT ARE

02:02:19.465 --> 02:02:21.367
AVAILABLE SO.

02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:22.868
THAT THAT'S A SIDE.

02:02:22.935 --> 02:02:25.104
ISSUE IN MY MAIN QUESTION

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:26.439
BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO SEE

02:02:26.505 --> 02:02:29.308
THAT BE USED AS AN EXCUSE TO NOT

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:30.810
MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS BUT SO

02:02:30.876 --> 02:02:32.278
MY MAIN QUESTION IS.

02:02:32.344 --> 02:02:33.646
WHAT'S YOUR ACTION PLAN YOU'VE

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:35.081
AGREED YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THIS

02:02:35.147 --> 02:02:37.049
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

02:02:37.116 --> 02:02:40.252
WHEN HOW WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE THE

02:02:40.319 --> 02:02:41.620
CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE

02:02:41.687 --> 02:02:44.724
MADE NOW WHAT'S THE TIME LINE

02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:46.225
HOW IS THAT GOING TO ROLL OUT?

02:02:46.292 --> 02:02:47.293
BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS IS GOING

02:02:47.359 --> 02:02:48.961
TO BE KEY AS WE CONTINUE TO

02:02:49.028 --> 02:02:50.663
TRACK THIS AND AND AND

02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:51.297
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:52.164
DO.

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:52.765
YOUR POINT ABOUT THE

02:02:52.832 --> 02:02:54.100
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WHICH

02:02:54.166 --> 02:02:56.435
COULD BE FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS.

02:02:56.502 --> 02:02:58.237
WELL TAKEN AND THAT IS SOMETHING

02:02:58.304 --> 02:02:59.572
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.

02:02:59.638 --> 02:03:00.139
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY NEVER BEEN

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:01.540
BEFORE US BEFORE IF YOU EXPECT

02:03:01.607 --> 02:03:02.942
US TO DO THINGS THAT ARE

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:04.443
DETAILED AND EXACT AND

02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:05.377
CORRECTION THE FIRST TIME

02:03:05.444 --> 02:03:08.247
THROUGH BUT WILL HAVE THAT

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:09.515
CONVERSATION THAT'S WIDE.

02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:11.951
BUT ALL THOSE A BACKDROP TO THE

02:03:12.017 --> 02:03:13.319
COMMITMENT TO THE PROCESS

02:03:13.385 --> 02:03:15.454
CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN SO

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:17.456
WHAT'S THE WORK PLAN.

02:03:17.523 --> 02:03:19.825
SO AT THE I MEAN AT THE MOST

02:03:19.892 --> 02:03:22.228
GENERAL LEVEL THE AUDIT REPORT

02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:24.930
HAS -- NOT JUST RECOMMENDATIONS

02:03:24.997 --> 02:03:26.732
BUT TIME FRAMES FOR

02:03:26.799 --> 02:03:29.702
IMPLEMENTATION AND WE ARE THE

02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:30.703
INTENTION IS.

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:31.871
TO IT FOR THE THINGS THAT WE CAN

02:03:31.937 --> 02:03:34.206
DO WITHOUT WITHOUT EXTRA FUNDING

02:03:34.273 --> 02:03:35.875
TO DO THEM BY THE DATES

02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:39.211
RECOMMENDED AND ALSO TO WORK ON

02:03:39.278 --> 02:03:43.349
ALL OF THEM -- YOU KNOW NOW I ON

02:03:43.415 --> 02:03:45.584
AN ONGOING BASIS AND TO

02:03:45.651 --> 02:03:48.087
IMPLEMENT THEM -- EARLY I MEAN

02:03:48.154 --> 02:03:50.356
BY MY COUNT WE HAVE THERE ARE

02:03:50.422 --> 02:03:51.190
THREE OR FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:51.824
THAT.

02:03:51.891 --> 02:03:53.559
I THINK ARE FULLY OR NEARLY

02:03:53.626 --> 02:03:56.262
FULLY -- RECOMMENDED -- THE

02:03:56.328 --> 02:03:57.763
DEADLINES FOR WHICH WERE IN

02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:59.799
OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR OR EVEN

02:03:59.865 --> 02:04:01.767
APRIL OF NEXT YEAR SO ARE YOU

02:04:01.834 --> 02:04:04.069
KNOW OUR PLAN IS TO MOVE THEM

02:04:04.136 --> 02:04:04.570
ALL FORWARD.

02:04:04.637 --> 02:04:07.206
AND AND TO DEFINITELY ACCOMPLISH

02:04:07.273 --> 02:04:09.775
THEM BY THE DATES THAT THE AUDIT

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:11.110
REPORT RECOMMENDS.

02:04:11.177 --> 02:04:12.912
OKAY SO THE OTHER REPORT THEN IS

02:04:12.978 --> 02:04:13.979
YOUR FRAMEWORK FOR WORKING ON

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:15.481
THAT DIRECT YES I THINK WE WOULD

02:04:15.548 --> 02:04:17.149
APPRECIATE AND I'M NOT SURE IF

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:18.217
THIS IS.

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:19.885
I'M NOT COMPLETELY SURE HOW J.

02:04:19.952 --> 02:04:22.721
LACK OPERATES OR ITS FUNCTION

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:24.490
BUT AS A COMMITTEE CHAIR AND I

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:25.424
DO WANT TO SPEAK FOR MY KIND OF

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:26.625
BUT WE WOULD LOVE TO BE KEPT

02:04:26.692 --> 02:04:28.928
ABREAST I THINK OF THE PROGRESS

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:30.563
THAT'S BEING MADE THE TIME LINES.

02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:32.164
THINGS IT CAN GET DONE EARLIER

02:04:32.231 --> 02:04:34.700
AND THERE ARE SOME DETAILS FOR

02:04:34.767 --> 02:04:36.602
EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THE ERRORS

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:38.404
THAT I FIND IT I FIND THIS KIND

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:39.638
OF ACROSS.

02:04:39.705 --> 02:04:41.373
GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS WE TEND TO

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:44.143
LOOK AT SNAPSHOTS FROM TIME TO

02:04:44.210 --> 02:04:45.311
TIME AND SO WE MISS.

02:04:45.377 --> 02:04:47.880
PATTERNS PICKING UP PATTERNS IS

02:04:47.947 --> 02:04:49.748
A FUNDAMENTAL THERE'S A THERE'S

02:04:49.815 --> 02:04:51.884
A THERE'S CULTURAL PROCEDURAL

02:04:51.951 --> 02:04:53.152
THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

02:04:53.219 --> 02:04:55.087
NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE. TO MAKE

02:04:55.154 --> 02:04:56.722
SURE THAT THOSE PATTERNS GET GET

02:04:56.789 --> 02:04:59.225
IDENTIFIED I DON'T KNOW HAT

02:04:59.291 --> 02:05:00.059
THAT THE AUDIT REPORT DIDN'T GO

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:00.693
INTO.

02:05:00.759 --> 02:05:05.331
THAT MUCH DETAIL BUT FROM YOUR

02:05:05.397 --> 02:05:06.398
STANDPOINT SINCE YOU HAVE.

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:07.132
THE OPERATIONAL FUNCTION YOU

02:05:07.199 --> 02:05:07.766
HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO DO THIS

02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:08.901
HOW DO YOU ADDRESS.

02:05:08.968 --> 02:05:11.237
THAT THE CHANGES NECESSARY

02:05:11.303 --> 02:05:13.239
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION TO MAKE

02:05:13.305 --> 02:05:14.940
SURE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING BROADER

02:05:15.007 --> 02:05:16.308
SCOPE RATHER THAN SO

02:05:16.375 --> 02:05:18.377
SPECIFICALLY.

02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:21.513
IN TERMS OF LOOKING BROADLY AND

02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:23.782
I MEAN FRANKLY AS THE AUDIT --

02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:27.019
REPORT RECOMMENDS -- FOR MATTERS

02:05:27.086 --> 02:05:29.521
THAT THAT COME IN AND CERTAINLY

02:05:29.588 --> 02:05:30.589
FOR INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE

02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:32.992
OPENED WE'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK

02:05:33.058 --> 02:05:35.661
AT ALL OF THE PRIOR COMPLAINTS.

02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:37.997
AND TO SEE IF THERE'S A PATTERN

02:05:38.063 --> 02:05:39.832
I MEAN THERE ARE THERE FRANKLY

02:05:39.899 --> 02:05:41.200
DUE PROCESS ISSUES.

02:05:41.267 --> 02:05:43.035
USING INVESTIGATIONS ON PREVIOUS

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:44.637
COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED

02:05:44.703 --> 02:05:46.438
BUT THERE MIGHT BE AN INDICATION

02:05:46.505 --> 02:05:48.307
THAT THAT THERE IS A PATTERN AND

02:05:48.374 --> 02:05:50.609
THE PATTERN IS ON GOING BUT SO

02:05:50.676 --> 02:05:52.544
PART OF THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:55.080
BE THROUGH -- DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:05:55.147 --> 02:05:57.750
INVESTIGATIONS LOOKING -- PRIOR

02:05:57.816 --> 02:05:59.518
COMPLAINTS I DO THINK ABOUT

02:05:59.585 --> 02:06:01.620
WITHIN NEW OR UPDATED OR

02:06:01.687 --> 02:06:03.856
MODIFIED CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

02:06:03.923 --> 02:06:06.358
THERE THERE MAY BE A WAY OF

02:06:06.425 --> 02:06:07.226
TRACKING IT ALSO ON THE DATA

02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:07.626
LEVEL.

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:09.261
YEAH NAY NAY I UNDERSTAND THE

02:06:09.328 --> 02:06:10.896
DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT THERE BUT A

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:12.631
LOT OF THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR

02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:14.066
PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES

02:06:14.133 --> 02:06:15.334
INTERNALLY ABOUT HOW YOU MANAGE

02:06:15.401 --> 02:06:17.469
THAT HOW YOU REPORTING ON ON

02:06:17.536 --> 02:06:19.939
WHAT YOU'RE USING FOR A DECISION.

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:21.540
BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS FOR

02:06:21.607 --> 02:06:22.975
SOMEONE TO HIDE BEHIND PRIOR

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:25.477
COMPLAINS THAT SAID AND DONE AND

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:29.114
YET THAT PATTERN OF SMALL ABUSES

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:32.851
SHOWS A BLATANT DISREGARD.

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:34.987
FOR THE LEVEL OF AUTHORITY THAT

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:37.256
A JUDGE HAS BEEN GIVEN THOSE

02:06:37.323 --> 02:06:39.358
KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT AGAIN

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:41.627
UNDERMINE PUBLIC TRUST IN.

02:06:41.694 --> 02:06:45.230
PROVIDE SOME CHALLENGES TO TO

02:06:45.297 --> 02:06:45.798
THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC IN

02:06:45.864 --> 02:06:46.665
DEALING.

02:06:46.732 --> 02:06:48.100
THIS IS VERY SAID THE COURTS TO

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:48.934
MAKE A VERY SIGNIFICANT

02:06:49.001 --> 02:06:50.469
DECISIONS FOR PEOPLE AND IF THEY

02:06:50.536 --> 02:06:51.370
ARE NOT.

02:06:51.437 --> 02:06:56.408
TRULY INDEPENDENCE AND I S. AND

02:06:56.475 --> 02:06:58.711

02:06:58.777 --> 02:07:00.179
THEN.

02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:01.880
PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT BECAUSE

02:07:01.947 --> 02:07:04.817
OF HUMAN FRAILTIES THAT'S WHAT

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:05.718

TO DETECT WHETHER THERE ARE

02:07:14.793 --> 02:07:17.363
PATTERNS THE CONCERN IS WHETHER

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:21.100
IT'S CHRONIC AND ONGOING AND AND

02:07:21.166 --> 02:07:24.103
I AGREE THAT -- THERE'S THERE

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:26.138

02:11:16.635 --> 02:11:18.237
DOCUMENTING THEIR STRATEGIES AT

02:11:18.303 --> 02:11:20.806
THE OUTSIDE OF INVESTIGATIONS

02:11:20.872 --> 02:11:22.474
YOU KNOW SEEMS TO BE AN INDUSTRY

02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:24.610
STANDARD -- THE AMERICAN BAR

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:26.245
ASSOCIATION THE COUNCIL OF

02:11:26.311 --> 02:11:28.080
INSPECTOR GENERAL ON INTEGRITY

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:29.581
AND EFFICIENCY BOTH RECOMMENDED.

02:11:29.648 --> 02:11:31.683
AT YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION --

02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:33.285
MANUAL SEEMS TO RECOMMEND THE

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:36.555
INVESTIGATIVE PLANS SO QUESTION

02:11:36.622 --> 02:11:39.224
IS IS -- IS A LACK OF OVERSIGHT

02:11:39.291 --> 02:11:41.560
IS LACK OF TRAINING WHY DON'T WE

02:11:41.627 --> 02:11:43.161
SEE THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:45.864
ADJUSTER COMMENTS ON THAT.

02:11:45.931 --> 02:11:49.167
I THINK -- I'D JUST LIKE -- TO

02:11:49.234 --> 02:11:50.402
GET TO THE END WHICH IS I MEAN

02:11:50.469 --> 02:11:52.838
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:11:52.904 --> 02:11:54.406
RECOMMENDED THAT WE IMPLEMENTED --

02:11:54.473 --> 02:11:56.908
WHERE -- WERE WORKING ON THAT

02:11:56.975 --> 02:11:58.810
AND THAT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED

02:11:58.877 --> 02:12:00.245
SOON.

02:12:00.312 --> 02:12:01.680
THAT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED SINCE

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:02.281
THE WILLSEE THAT AT THE CHECK

02:12:02.347 --> 02:12:04.249
IN.

02:12:04.316 --> 02:12:05.317
THAT WOULD DO YOU IMPLEMENTED

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:07.286
SUED MEANS THE THE THE END OF

02:12:07.352 --> 02:12:08.754
THIS MONTH OR THESE.

02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:10.956
THE OCTOBER WHEN WE DO THE

02:12:11.023 --> 02:12:11.556
PROGRESS REPORT WE'LL SEE AT

02:12:11.623 --> 02:12:12.024
THAT.

02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:13.292
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WILL

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:15.294
BE IN THE IN THE PROGRESS REPORT

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.963
THAT'S DUE IN TWELVE DAYS BUT MY

02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:20.632
MY MY ANTICIPATION IS IS THAT

02:12:20.699 --> 02:12:22.868
THAT WILL BE COMPLETED WITHIN

02:12:22.934 --> 02:12:24.169
THE NEXT MONTH OR SO.

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:25.437
GOT IT AND JUST MY UNDERSTANDING

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:27.439
FROM YOUR TESTIMONY EARLIER --

02:12:27.506 --> 02:12:31.243
FOR THE BI CAMERAL WHEN WE WERE

02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:32.244
SPEAKING ABOUT THAT -- SEEMS

02:12:32.311 --> 02:12:35.480
LIKE YOU'RE NOT OPPOSED TO IT --

02:12:35.547 --> 02:12:36.114
WHERE TO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR

02:12:36.181 --> 02:12:37.449
TESTIMONY SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT

02:12:37.516 --> 02:12:39.017
OPPOSED TO MOVING IN THAT

02:12:39.084 --> 02:12:39.618
DIRECTION IF THAT'S WHERE THE

02:12:39.685 --> 02:12:40.519
LEGISLATURE?

02:12:40.585 --> 02:12:42.988
WHICH IS TO MOVE BUT YOUR LETTER

02:12:43.055 --> 02:12:44.323
AND RESPONSE SEEM TO BE

02:12:44.389 --> 02:12:45.724
CONTRADICTORY TO THAT IS THAT

02:12:45.791 --> 02:12:47.759
JUST A CHANGE OF DIRECTION AT

02:12:47.826 --> 02:12:48.794
THIS POINT.

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:50.996
I THINK THAT MAYBE THE ANSWER IS

02:12:51.063 --> 02:12:53.565
MY LETTER WAS NOT WRITTEN AS

02:12:53.632 --> 02:12:55.767
WELL AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN --

02:12:55.834 --> 02:12:57.769
AND WHAT I ATE INTENDED TO SEND

02:12:57.836 --> 02:12:58.904
THE LETTER AND WHAT I SAID

02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:01.740
EARLIER WAS -- IF THAT SOMETHING

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:04.142
IF THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINES

02:13:04.209 --> 02:13:05.477
AND THE VOTERS DETERMINED THAT

02:13:05.544 --> 02:13:08.980
THE THAT THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD

02:13:09.047 --> 02:13:09.948
BE AMENDED THAT'S A POLICY.

02:13:10.015 --> 02:13:11.383
TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE VOTERS

02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:14.553
TO MAKE WHAT I SAID WAS THAT THE

02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:19.391
COMMISSION'S CURRENT STRUCTURE

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:22.361
PROCESS AND I YOU KNOW THERE ARE

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:23.729
A LOT OF THINGS TO BE SAID ABOUT

02:13:23.795 --> 02:13:25.564
IT AND YOU KNOW I DON'T -- WE

02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:26.798
DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A A SUPREME

02:13:26.865 --> 02:13:28.767
COURT ARGUMENT ABOUT IT BUT WE

02:13:28.834 --> 02:13:32.404
DO PROVIDE JUDGES WITH NOTICE WE

02:13:32.471 --> 02:13:33.839
PROVIDE THEM WITH PROCESS.

02:13:33.905 --> 02:13:35.273
AND THEY HAVE -- AMPLE

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.975
OPPORTUNITIES TO KNOW THE

02:13:37.042 --> 02:13:38.510
CHARGES AGAINST THEM AND TO

02:13:38.577 --> 02:13:40.345
DEFEND THEMSELVES THAT'S WHAT

02:13:40.412 --> 02:13:42.481
DUE PROCESS REQUIRES AND WE

02:13:42.547 --> 02:13:45.851
PROVIDE DUE PROCESS NOW.

02:13:45.917 --> 02:13:46.485
GOT IT YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S

02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:46.918
EVERYBODY JUST WANTS

02:13:46.985 --> 02:13:48.387
ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY

02:13:48.453 --> 02:13:50.989
OBVIOUSLY DUE PROCESS FOR THE

02:13:51.056 --> 02:13:53.024
JUDGES AS WELL SO THAT THEY GET --

02:13:53.091 --> 02:13:54.793
A FAIR SHAKE UP I BELIEVE

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:56.228
SENATOR ALLEN HAD MENTIONED

02:13:56.294 --> 02:13:58.530
MAYBE EVEN PAYING SOME OF THE

02:13:58.597 --> 02:13:59.931
THE INVESTIGATORS BABY IF THAT

02:13:59.998 --> 02:14:01.566
HELPS THAT PROCESS BUT DO YOU

02:14:01.633 --> 02:14:03.268
HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:14:03.335 --> 02:14:04.870
ON WHAT YOU THINK WOULD.

02:14:04.936 --> 02:14:07.539
HELP US IN THE GOAL OF REACHING.

02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:08.407
THE TRANSPARENCY THE

02:14:08.473 --> 02:14:09.708
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THE PUBLIC

02:14:09.775 --> 02:14:11.877
DEMANDS BUT STILL BEING FAIR TO

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:13.478
THE JUDGES -- MAYBE

02:14:13.545 --> 02:14:16.415
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WARRANT

02:14:16.481 --> 02:14:18.917
OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT REPORT.

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:20.218
THE SO I DO THINK THAT OUR

02:14:20.285 --> 02:14:24.289
PROCESSES NOW ARE FAIR AND

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:27.793
INAPPROPRIATE -- AT I'D SAY I'VE

02:14:27.859 --> 02:14:29.161
STE I SENT A COUPLE TIMES I JUST

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:29.661
IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:30.796
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

02:14:30.862 --> 02:14:33.198
I DO THINK THAT -- YOU'LL WANT

02:14:33.265 --> 02:14:35.066
TO HEAR FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:37.803
INTERESTED PARTIES ABOUT THE

02:14:37.869 --> 02:14:39.004
STRUCTURE OF THE COMMISSION

02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:40.739
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:41.973
STRUCTURE.

02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:44.476
A BICAMERAL A COMMISSION THAT

02:14:44.543 --> 02:14:46.511
ALL OF THE STATES THAT HOW THE

02:14:46.578 --> 02:14:47.813
QUOTE UNQUOTE BICAMERAL

02:14:47.879 --> 02:14:49.014
COMMISSION THEY DON'T ALL HAVE

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.215
THE SAME CONTENT.

02:14:50.282 --> 02:14:53.585
NO NO STATE HAS THE STRUCTURE

02:14:53.652 --> 02:14:54.986
THAT THE ABA MODEL RULES

02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:57.622
RECOMMEND -- THE WHAT THE AUDIT

02:14:57.689 --> 02:14:59.624
REPORT RECOMMENDS IS NOT

02:14:59.691 --> 02:15:01.660
ENTIRELY IN LINE WITH WHAT THE

02:15:01.726 --> 02:15:03.995
ABA MODEL RULES RECOMMEND AND SO

02:15:04.062 --> 02:15:06.898
ALL I ALL I WANT TO SAY IS I DO

02:15:06.965 --> 02:15:07.699
THINK THAT WE HAVE A GOOD SYSTEM

02:15:07.766 --> 02:15:10.001
NOW AND I DO THINK IT COMPORTS.

02:15:10.068 --> 02:15:12.070
WITH THE PROCESS AND THE

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:13.572
PROCESSES ARE GOOD.

02:15:13.638 --> 02:15:15.474
AND IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:17.442
DIFFERENT STRUCTURE THAT THAT

02:15:17.509 --> 02:15:19.478
JUST BE CAREFULLY THOUGHT

02:15:19.544 --> 02:15:21.713
THROUGH SO THAT WE DON'T END UP

02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:24.115
WITH A SYSTEM THAT IS WORSE.

02:15:24.182 --> 02:15:30.188
GOT MORE EXPENSIVE RIGHT.

02:15:30.255 --> 02:15:31.122
CAN YOU JUST OUTLINED WHAT ARE

02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.790
SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

02:15:31.857 --> 02:15:32.891
THE ABA MODEL.

02:15:32.958 --> 02:15:34.059
THAT'S NOT OUTLINED ARTS OF THE

02:15:34.125 --> 02:15:34.860
THINGS WE SHOULD CONSIDER KIND

02:15:34.926 --> 02:15:36.495
OF IF WE WERE TO MOVE DOWN THIS

02:15:36.561 --> 02:15:38.463
PATH BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A

02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:40.932
LOT OF QUESTIONS ON THE BY CAN.

02:15:40.999 --> 02:15:43.602
POST SO -- IT JUST FOR STARTERS

02:15:43.668 --> 02:15:46.872
THE THE AUDIT REPORT RECOMMENDS

02:15:46.938 --> 02:15:49.374
THAT -- THERE FOR THE

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:51.810
ADJUDICATIVE BODY THAT THE

02:15:51.877 --> 02:15:54.346
ADJUDICATIVE BODY BE A MAJORITY

02:15:54.412 --> 02:15:57.382
OF THE LAY MEMBERS -- I I WILL

02:15:57.449 --> 02:16:02.521
NOTE THAT IN -- IN THE CURRENTLY

02:16:02.587 --> 02:16:03.855
THE WAY -- DISCIPLINE TRIALS ARE

02:16:03.922 --> 02:16:06.224
CONDUCTED THERE ARE GOVERNED BY

02:16:06.291 --> 02:16:08.293
THE RULES OF EVIDENCE -- SO

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:09.895
THERE IS AN OPEN QUESTION IN MY

02:16:09.961 --> 02:16:12.364
MIND ABOUT HOW A MAJORITY OF LAY

02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:14.766
PEOPLE WOULD APPLY RULES OF

02:16:14.833 --> 02:16:16.835
EVIDENCE IN A TRIAL IN TERM WHAT

02:16:16.902 --> 02:16:18.370
THE ABA MODEL STRUCTURE

02:16:18.436 --> 02:16:19.804
RECOMMENDS IS THAT THERE BE ONE

02:16:19.871 --> 02:16:22.040
JUDGE ONE LAWYER AND ONE LAY

02:16:22.107 --> 02:16:24.509
PERSON -- AS A PART OF THE

02:16:24.576 --> 02:16:25.977
ADJUDICATIVE BODY WHICH IS

02:16:26.044 --> 02:16:27.312
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE AUDIT

02:16:27.379 --> 02:16:28.547
REPORT RECOMMENDS.

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:30.849
THE A BE A MODEL RULE ALSO

02:16:30.916 --> 02:16:33.018
RECOMMENDS THAT FINAL DISCIPLINE

02:16:33.084 --> 02:16:34.719
BE IMPLEMENTED BY.

02:16:34.786 --> 02:16:37.556
THE BY STATE SUPREME COURTS --

02:16:37.622 --> 02:16:39.224
THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IN THE ONE

02:16:39.291 --> 02:16:41.293
THE AUDIT REPORT RECOMMENDS IS

02:16:41.359 --> 02:16:43.228
THAT -- THE DISCIPLINE

02:16:43.295 --> 02:16:46.898
IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMMISSION BE --

02:16:46.965 --> 02:16:49.868
BE YES -- SELF EXECUTING -- EAT

02:16:49.935 --> 02:16:51.136
AND THERE NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT

02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:55.574
GIVEN TO HOW -- HOW WOULD YOU

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:57.242
TWO CASES? TO WORK ON ONE THING

02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:59.578
THAT -- MISTER HARRIS SAID WAS

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:02.314
THAT WHAT THE DISCIPLINARY BODY

02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:03.348
WOULD DO.

02:17:03.415 --> 02:17:05.050
THE ONLY THING IT WOULD DO WOULD

02:17:05.116 --> 02:17:07.419
BE TO A PINE ON DISCIPLINE BUT

02:17:07.485 --> 02:17:09.354
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY RIGHT.

02:17:09.421 --> 02:17:11.089
THE THE ADJUDICATIVE BODY IS

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:12.157
GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUDICATE

02:17:12.223 --> 02:17:14.826
FACTS AND APPLY THE LAW AND THEN

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:17.896
APPLY DISCIPLINE AND SO THAT IS

02:17:17.963 --> 02:17:20.098
A THAT IS A MORE SERIOUS

02:17:20.165 --> 02:17:22.534
ENDEAVOR AND THEN THERE ARE

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:24.836
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER --

02:17:24.903 --> 02:17:27.472
EVERYTHING IF IF FOR THE

02:17:27.539 --> 02:17:29.841
ADJUDICATIVE BODY ARE YOU GOING

02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:31.977
TO CHARGE EVERY SINGLE JUDGE WHO

02:17:32.043 --> 02:17:34.012
IS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED

02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:36.848
MISCONDUCT -- NOW THE NOW THE

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:38.883
CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT ALL

02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:41.553
CHARGES BE PUBLIC SO EVEN FOR

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.388
LOW LEVEL MISCONDUCT ARE WE

02:17:43.455 --> 02:17:45.357
GOING TO NOW PUBLICLY CHARGE

02:17:45.423 --> 02:17:48.026
JUDGES WITH LOW LEVEL MISCONDUCT.

02:17:48.093 --> 02:17:49.728
AND EVEN IF THE LEVEL OF

02:17:49.794 --> 02:17:51.997
DISCIPLINE IS A PRIVATE

02:17:52.063 --> 02:17:54.165
ADMONISHMENT EVERYONE WILL KNOW

02:17:54.232 --> 02:17:55.600
ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:58.103
CHARGES AND AND THE JUDGE HAS

02:17:58.169 --> 02:18:02.540
BEEN PUBLICLY CHARGE.

02:18:02.607 --> 02:18:04.109
I'M NOT ADVOCATING ONE WAY RIGHT

02:18:04.175 --> 02:18:04.743
I JUST THINK THAT THIS NEEDS TO

02:18:04.809 --> 02:18:05.377
BE THOUGHT THROUGH BECAUSE I DO

02:18:05.443 --> 02:18:07.879
THINK THAT WITH SOME JUDGES --

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:09.014
THEY GET PRIVATE DISCIPLINE THEY

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:11.016
UNDERSTAND.

02:18:11.082 --> 02:18:12.684
AND THEY DON'T RE OFFEND AND

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:14.853
THERE'S VALUE IN THE DISCIPLINE

02:18:14.919 --> 02:18:19.324
BEING PRIVATE DISCIPLINE.

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:20.792
OKAY THANK YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

02:18:20.859 --> 02:18:21.960
ALL THINGS THAT NEED TO HAVE A

02:18:22.027 --> 02:18:24.229
LONGER DISCUSSION A MORE ROBUST

02:18:24.295 --> 02:18:26.164
DISCUSSION AS IF THE LEGISLATURE

02:18:26.231 --> 02:18:28.199
MOVES INTO A LOOKING AT THIS BI

02:18:28.266 --> 02:18:29.801
CAMERAL A ARE -- CONSTITUTIONAL

02:18:29.868 --> 02:18:31.202
AMENDMENT JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:32.904
WE GOT SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS --

02:18:32.971 --> 02:18:35.106
AS WELL AS WE PROBABLY CONTINUE

02:18:35.173 --> 02:18:37.776
THOSE DELIBERATIONS -- DID WANT

02:18:37.842 --> 02:18:39.844
TO ASK. ONE FINAL QUESTION

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:43.615
PROBABLY.

02:18:43.682 --> 02:18:46.751
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW.

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:48.753
TO ME THE THE SHORTCOMINGS OF

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:50.121
THE EXAMPLE OF THE JUDGE WHERE

02:18:50.188 --> 02:18:51.456
THERE WAS COMPLAINTS OF HIS

02:18:51.523 --> 02:18:52.691
TRANSCRIPTS.

02:18:52.757 --> 02:18:54.526
NOTHING WAS DONE FOR YEARS AND

02:18:54.592 --> 02:18:55.994
THEN THE JUDGE ULTIMATELY

02:18:56.061 --> 02:18:58.096
STEPPED DOWN.

02:18:58.163 --> 02:19:00.532
WHAT COULD HAVE GOTTEN WHAT

02:19:00.598 --> 02:19:02.367
COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER?

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:05.236
OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER.

02:19:05.303 --> 02:19:06.738
BUT NOW THE IN HINDSIGHT I KNOW

02:19:06.805 --> 02:19:08.440
IT'S MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK

02:19:08.506 --> 02:19:10.241
IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY

02:19:10.308 --> 02:19:13.344
HINDSIGHT BUT HOW COULD WE HOW

02:19:13.411 --> 02:19:15.413
CAN WE IMPROVE THAT PROCESS SO

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.982
THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

02:19:18.049 --> 02:19:21.119
SO WE CAN WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK --

02:19:21.186 --> 02:19:23.254
FOR WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK FOR

02:19:23.321 --> 02:19:23.888
PATTERNS AND I DO THINK THAT IF

02:19:23.955 --> 02:19:26.091
YOU HAVE.

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.525
IMPROVE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

02:19:27.592 --> 02:19:29.027
IT MIGHT AT THE END MIGHT BE

02:19:29.094 --> 02:19:30.528
EQUALED.

02:19:30.595 --> 02:19:32.230
EASY TO TRACK.

02:19:32.297 --> 02:19:34.265
THINGS -- OUT AT OUT A DOLLAR

02:19:34.332 --> 02:19:36.201
DOWN A LEVEL I WOULD JUST LIKE

02:19:36.267 --> 02:19:40.305
TO ADD -- THAT -- THERE ARE --

02:19:40.371 --> 02:19:43.074
OTHER MATTERS THAT WE HAVE WHERE.

02:19:43.141 --> 02:19:45.910
IT'S A NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION --

02:19:45.977 --> 02:19:47.612
WITH THE JUDGE THAT THE JUDGE

02:19:47.679 --> 02:19:49.547
WILL -- LEAVE THE BENCH AND

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:51.116
AGREE NOT TO SERVICE A JUDICIAL

02:19:51.182 --> 02:19:52.684
OFFICER AGAIN AND WE THINK WHEN

02:19:52.751 --> 02:19:54.285
THAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S BEEN

02:19:54.352 --> 02:19:55.720
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT.

02:19:55.787 --> 02:19:58.690
THAT'S THAT IS -- SIGNIFICANT

02:19:58.757 --> 02:19:59.891
PUBLIC PROTECTION.

02:19:59.958 --> 02:20:01.426
I'M NOT SURE IT'S THE CASE THAT

02:20:01.493 --> 02:20:02.660
IN THE EXAMPLE YOU'RE TALKING

02:20:02.727 --> 02:20:04.028
ABOUT THAT THE JUDGE JUST

02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:06.865
DECIDED TO GO ON HIS OWN AYE AYE.

02:20:06.931 --> 02:20:08.533
AYE AYE READILY ASSUME THAT WAS

02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:11.402
A NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION.

02:20:11.469 --> 02:20:12.370
GOT IT.

02:20:12.437 --> 02:20:14.139
JUST ONE CASE PLEASE CENTER JUST

02:20:14.205 --> 02:20:14.973
A LAST COMMENT I LOOK AT THIS

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:16.808
HEARING IS THE BEGINNING OF

02:20:16.875 --> 02:20:18.643
DISCUSSION SO I HOPE THAT.

02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:20.111
THIS WAGES SOME OF YOUR ANXIETY

02:20:20.178 --> 02:20:22.413
ALSO I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.015
TAKE A LOOK TO WITH THE

02:20:24.082 --> 02:20:26.151
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS I MEAN I I

02:20:26.217 --> 02:20:27.852
THINK THERE IS SOME CONCERN AND

02:20:27.919 --> 02:20:29.053
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT PANEL

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:30.622
ABOUT AT WHAT POINT.

02:20:30.688 --> 02:20:32.991
DO WE ENGAGE THE JUDGES WHO ARE

02:20:33.057 --> 02:20:34.259
THE SUBJECT OF THESE

02:20:34.325 --> 02:20:38.429
INVESTIGATIONS -- HOW EARLY IT

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:40.598
IS MOST APPROPRIATE AND WHAT IS?

02:20:40.665 --> 02:20:41.800
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

02:20:41.866 --> 02:20:43.635
SO I THINK THOSE ARE ALSO PART

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:45.870
TO THIS DISCUSSION THAT WE I

02:20:45.937 --> 02:20:47.972
SHOULD GO INTO WITH SOME GREATER

02:20:48.039 --> 02:20:49.040
LENGTH YOU KNOW THIS IS MORE AND

02:20:49.107 --> 02:20:50.475

BUT THERE ARE SOME LEGITIMATE

02:20:52.777 --> 02:20:54.579
CONCERN SHOULD I THINK THE

02:20:54.646 --> 02:20:55.780

02:24:58.456 --> 02:24:59.791
DAYS.

02:24:59.857 --> 02:25:01.492
WHERE THEY AT LEAST TRY TO MEET

02:25:01.559 --> 02:25:02.827
SO THAT THESE INVESTIGATIONS

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:04.262
HAPPEN WITHIN A CERTAIN EXPECTED

02:25:04.328 --> 02:25:06.397

THE PUBLIC PROTECTION IT'S ALSO

02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:09.100

BEING INVESTIGATED SO THAT THEY

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:11.969
KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT?

02:25:12.036 --> 02:25:13.371
AS WELL AS SPECIFIC PROCEDURES

02:25:13.438 --> 02:25:14.939
THAT SHOULD BE TAKING PLACE AT

02:25:15.006 --> 02:25:16.641
THE INVESTIGATIONS WAS ALREADY

02:25:16.707 --> 02:25:18.109
MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE

02:25:18.176 --> 02:25:19.377
INVESTIGATORS ARE.

02:25:19.444 --> 02:25:21.112
GIVEN A LOT OF DISCRETION THAT

02:25:21.179 --> 02:25:22.480
THE WAY THAT IT'S CURRENTLY

02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:24.348
RUNNING RIGHT NOW.

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:25.283
AND GIVEN THAT THE AUDITORS

02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:28.019
FOUND THAT -- THE COMMISSION AND

02:25:28.086 --> 02:25:30.288
ALMOST ALL CASES JUST ACCEPT THE

02:25:30.354 --> 02:25:31.556
RECOMMENDATION OF THE ATTORNEY

02:25:31.622 --> 02:25:33.057
WHO IS INVESTIGATING AT LEAST AT

02:25:33.124 --> 02:25:36.160
THE BEGINNING STAGES WHERE IT

02:25:36.227 --> 02:25:36.461
TALKS ABOUT.

02:25:36.527 --> 02:25:38.096
AND CLOSING THE COMPLAINT

02:25:38.162 --> 02:25:39.263
WITHOUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION I

02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:40.698
THINK THEY ONLY. FOR ELEVEN

02:25:40.765 --> 02:25:42.233
INSTANCES WHERE THE COMMISSION

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:43.734
DISAGREED WITH THE ATTORNEYS

02:25:43.801 --> 02:25:46.104
DECISION TO NOT TO CONTENT OR TO

02:25:46.170 --> 02:25:47.538
CLOSE THE INVESTIGATION OUT OF

02:25:47.605 --> 02:25:49.674
LIKE -- SIX THOUSAND AND

02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:50.308
REMEMBER THE NUMBER OFF THE TOP

02:25:50.374 --> 02:25:51.242
OF MY HEAD BUT IT WAS A VERY

02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:52.577
VERY TINY PERCENTAGE.

02:25:52.643 --> 02:25:53.778
SO THAT JUST DEMONSTRATE THE

02:25:53.845 --> 02:25:56.047
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING -- GOOD

02:25:56.114 --> 02:25:58.116
PROCEDURES AND AND REALLY WELL

02:25:58.182 --> 02:26:00.184
TRAINED INVESTIGATORS SOMEBODY

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.652
WHO'S SUPERVISED.

02:26:01.719 --> 02:26:02.520
WHO COULD SUPERVISE THE

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:04.255
INVESTIGATORS AND ALSO PROVIDE

02:26:04.322 --> 02:26:05.857
SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW IF THE

02:26:05.923 --> 02:26:07.458
INVESTIGATION IS VERY VERY

02:26:07.525 --> 02:26:09.093
IMPORTANT IN THIS PROCESS

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:10.795
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT

02:26:10.862 --> 02:26:11.762
IT IS A CLEAR AND CONVINCING

02:26:11.829 --> 02:26:13.531
EVIDENCE BIRD AND THAT THEY HAVE

02:26:13.598 --> 02:26:14.065
TO MEET?

02:26:14.132 --> 02:26:15.833
AND SO -- THE FINAL

02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:16.767
RECOMMENDATION WITH RESPECT TO

02:26:16.834 --> 02:26:18.936
THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC

02:26:19.003 --> 02:26:19.804
THAN WHAT WAS LAID OUT IN THE

02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:20.471
I'D IT.

02:26:20.538 --> 02:26:21.806
HAS TO DO WITH THE TRAINING AND

02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:23.574
THE INVESTIGATORS ON THE FACT

02:26:23.641 --> 02:26:28.045
THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE.

02:26:28.112 --> 02:26:28.546
ATTORNEYS ALONE DOESN'T

02:26:28.613 --> 02:26:29.413
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY'RE

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:31.516
TRAINED AND HOW TO YOU AND DO A

02:26:31.582 --> 02:26:33.050
QUALITY INVESTIGATION AND TO

02:26:33.117 --> 02:26:34.752
MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:36.120
EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE.

02:26:36.187 --> 02:26:38.556
SO AND ENSURING THAT THERE IS

02:26:38.623 --> 02:26:40.491
VERY SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR THAT

02:26:40.558 --> 02:26:41.959
INVESTIGATORS WE THINK IT'S

02:26:42.026 --> 02:26:42.493
SOMETHING THAT IS A VERY

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:44.962
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE

02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:45.763
RECOMMENDATION [inaudible]

02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:48.633
AND I SOMETHING THAT WASN'T

02:26:48.699 --> 02:26:52.670
FOCUSED ON TOO MUCH -- IN THE

02:26:52.737 --> 02:26:53.804
PRIOR PANELS THAT I WANTED TO

02:26:53.871 --> 02:26:55.006
FOCUS ON IS THE FACT.

02:26:55.072 --> 02:26:57.375
OUT THE SPECIAL MASTERS -- AND

02:26:57.441 --> 02:26:58.543
THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION

02:26:58.609 --> 02:27:00.077
THAT THEY DON'T.

02:27:00.144 --> 02:27:01.546
THAT THE SPECIAL MASTER SHOULD

02:27:01.612 --> 02:27:03.814
NOT BE PART OF THIS PROCESS --

02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:05.383
AND AND WE WE REALLY SUPPORT

02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:06.751
THAT RECOMMENDATION TO THE

02:27:06.817 --> 02:27:08.519
EXTENT THAT THE SPECIAL MASTERS

02:27:08.586 --> 02:27:10.121
ARE JUDGES THEMSELVES AND IF

02:27:10.188 --> 02:27:11.389
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS AS A

02:27:11.455 --> 02:27:13.691
PART AS A PERCEPTION OF THE

02:27:13.758 --> 02:27:16.160
PUBLIC -- WHETHER OR NOT IT'S

02:27:16.227 --> 02:27:17.662
ACTUALLY HAPPENING BIG THERE CAN

02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:19.330
DEFINITELY BE A PERCEPTION THAT

02:27:19.397 --> 02:27:21.132
JUDGES WHO ARE JUDGING THEIR OWN

02:27:21.199 --> 02:27:23.367
PEERS THEY HAVE A TENDENCY EVEN

02:27:23.434 --> 02:27:26.871
AND EVEN SUBCONSCIOUSLY.

02:27:26.938 --> 02:27:28.206
TO GIVE MORE LENIENT AND

02:27:28.272 --> 02:27:30.274
DISCIPLINE RECOMMENDATIONS FAN

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:31.742
THEN THEY MAY BE MEMBERS OF THE

02:27:31.809 --> 02:27:32.977
PUBLIC MIGHT.

02:27:33.044 --> 02:27:35.046
AND I BELIEVE THE AUDITOR FOUND

02:27:35.112 --> 02:27:37.148
THAT IN THE CASES WHERE THE

02:27:37.215 --> 02:27:38.883
COMMISSION DIFFERED FROM THE

02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:39.717
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SPECIAL

02:27:39.784 --> 02:27:41.686
MASTER THE COMMISSION WHO HAS

02:27:41.752 --> 02:27:43.654
PUBLIC MEMBERS ON THE COMMISSION.

02:27:43.721 --> 02:27:45.790
IN EVERY INSTANCE VOTED TO

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:47.425
ELEVATE THE RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:48.559
DISCIPLINES I THINK THAT WAS AN

02:27:48.626 --> 02:27:50.094
IMPORTANT FACT THAT I WANTED TO

02:27:50.161 --> 02:27:51.128
MAKE SURE.

02:27:51.195 --> 02:27:53.130
WE HIGHLIGHTED HERE -- WITH

02:27:53.197 --> 02:27:55.466
RESPECT TO THE CONCERN THAT

02:27:55.533 --> 02:27:56.934
SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE REYES WITH

02:27:57.001 --> 02:27:58.970
HAVING PUBLIC MEMBERS INVOLVED

02:27:59.036 --> 02:28:01.339
IN BEING YOU KNOW AND EDUCATING

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:01.973
THESE CASES.

02:28:02.039 --> 02:28:03.774
THIS THIS IS WHERE IT'S REALLY

02:28:03.841 --> 02:28:05.876
HELPFUL TO LOOK AT THE WAY THAT

02:28:05.943 --> 02:28:08.613
OTHER STATE AGENCIES RYAN.

02:28:08.679 --> 02:28:10.848
AND I HAD WE'VE KIND OF

02:28:10.915 --> 02:28:12.583
SPECIFIED.

02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:13.184
IS AND I WILL GO THROUGH THE

02:28:13.251 --> 02:28:14.318
WHOLE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE

02:28:14.385 --> 02:28:15.953
ACT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:16.754
BUT I DO WITH WHEN YOU ARE

02:28:16.821 --> 02:28:19.490
LOOKING AT HOW TO RUN THIS I CAN

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:20.591
TELL YOU THAT -- FOR EXAMPLE

02:28:20.658 --> 02:28:21.926
WHAT THE MEDICAL BOARD THE BOARD

02:28:21.993 --> 02:28:23.728
DOES MAKE THE DECISIONS -- AS

02:28:23.794 --> 02:28:25.096
FAR AS THE DISCIPLINE AT THE END

02:28:25.162 --> 02:28:26.397
OF THE DAY IN THE MEDICAL BOARD

02:28:26.464 --> 02:28:29.634
IS MADE UP OF PUBLIC MEMBERS AND

02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:31.902
POSITION MEMBERS -- THAT THE

02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:33.838
WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE I THINK IS

02:28:33.904 --> 02:28:36.040
THE BALANCE BETWEEN INDEPENDENCE

02:28:36.107 --> 02:28:38.042
AND EXPERTISE SO IF YOU HAVE

02:28:38.109 --> 02:28:39.777
ONLY JUDGES MAKING DECISIONS

02:28:39.844 --> 02:28:41.412
ABOUT THE WAY THAT JUDGES SHOULD

02:28:41.479 --> 02:28:42.713
OR SHOULDN'T BEHAVE.

02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:44.448
YOU MAY HAVE THE EXPERTISE BUT

02:28:44.515 --> 02:28:45.683
YOU'RE LACKING THE INDEPENDENCE

02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:47.285
FROM THE PUBLIC STANDPOINT AS

02:28:47.351 --> 02:28:49.020
FAR AS WHAT IS FAIR AND

02:28:49.086 --> 02:28:50.421
EQUITABLE AND SO YOU WANT TO

02:28:50.488 --> 02:28:51.922
MAKE SURE AND AS YOU'RE PUTTING

02:28:51.989 --> 02:28:53.457
SOMETHING LIKE THIS FORWARD.

02:28:53.524 --> 02:28:55.726
THAT THERE SHOULD BE THIS

02:28:55.793 --> 02:28:57.361
BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND THAT

02:28:57.428 --> 02:28:58.963
AND THAT REALLY CAN BE DONE.

02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:00.231
ON THE OTHER THING THAT WE WE

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:01.666
POINTED OUT IN OUR

02:29:01.732 --> 02:29:03.100
RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT BOARD

02:29:03.167 --> 02:29:04.769
SUCH AS THE MEDICAL BOARD HAVE

02:29:04.835 --> 02:29:06.203
DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES.

02:29:06.270 --> 02:29:06.871
THAT THEY GO THROUGH THE

02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:09.240
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE PROCESS

02:29:09.307 --> 02:29:10.408
TO ADOPT.

02:29:10.474 --> 02:29:12.843
AND AND THAT GUIDELINE AGAIN

02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:15.813
BOTH FOR THE JUDGES WHO WOULD BE

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:16.947
UNDER INVESTIGATION AND THE

02:29:17.014 --> 02:29:18.983
POTENTIAL DISCIPLINE AS WELL AS

02:29:19.050 --> 02:29:20.618
FOR THE PUBLIC IT REALLY.

02:29:20.685 --> 02:29:23.688
MAKES IT MORE CLEAR WHAT WHICH

02:29:23.754 --> 02:29:25.323
TYPES OF VIOLATIONS OF WILL YOU

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:25.923
KNOW.

02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.524
WHICH TYPES OF DISCIPLINE AND

02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:27.425
NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

02:29:27.491 --> 02:29:29.660
ADOPTED IN THE PUBLIC PROCESS.

02:29:29.727 --> 02:29:33.164
AND SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT.

02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:35.599
WE DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT THE

02:29:35.666 --> 02:29:41.272
THE COMMISSION CONSIDER -- AND

02:29:41.339 --> 02:29:43.207
AND WE ALSO REALLY DO RECOMMEND

02:29:43.274 --> 02:29:45.376
THIS BI CAMERAL RECOMMENDATION

02:29:45.443 --> 02:29:46.977
FOR THE TRUCTURE IT'S AN WE ARE

02:29:47.044 --> 02:29:48.446
WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER

02:29:48.512 --> 02:29:50.147
GENCY IN CALIFORNIA FOR SURE

02:29:50.214 --> 02:29:52.450
THAT HAS THIS UNITARY STRUCTURE.

02:29:52.516 --> 02:29:53.984
USUALLY THE THAT REALLY THE

02:29:54.051 --> 02:29:55.686
BOARD WHO IS MAKING A FINAL

02:29:55.753 --> 02:29:57.221
DECISION ABOUT DISCIPLINE SHOULD

02:29:57.288 --> 02:29:59.223
NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION AT ALL

02:29:59.290 --> 02:30:00.858
ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING KIND OF

02:30:00.925 --> 02:30:01.625
ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE AT THE

02:30:01.692 --> 02:30:02.493
BEGINNING.

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:04.295
WHETHER IT'S JUST EVEN IF IT

02:30:04.362 --> 02:30:06.197
COULD SUB CONSCIOUS THOSE DOES

02:30:06.263 --> 02:30:07.998
FACTS ARE AND AND THE HEADS OF

02:30:08.065 --> 02:30:09.133
THE ULTIMATE DECISION MAKERS AND

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:10.468
SO IT'S A IT'S A MUCH.

02:30:10.534 --> 02:30:12.203
MORE FAIR PROCESS FOR EVERYONE

02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:14.171
INVOLVED TO HAVE A SEPARATE

02:30:14.238 --> 02:30:14.705
STRUCTURE.

U. S. SUPPORT THAT

02:30:16.006 --> 02:30:18.242
RECOMMENDATION -- AND THEN JUST

CALIFORNIA AND THEY'VE

02:30:30.488 --> 02:30:32.056
IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL OF THESE

02:30:32.123 --> 02:30:32.990
INCLUDING.

02:38:22.759 --> 02:38:23.760
DID I CONSCIOUSLY OR

02:38:23.827 --> 02:38:25.462
UNCONSCIOUSLY ALLOW THE

02:38:25.529 --> 02:38:27.231
INTRUSION OF INSIDIOUS BIAS TO

02:38:27.297 --> 02:38:29.099
COMMAND.

02:38:29.166 --> 02:38:30.667
DID I ALLOW THE PRESS OF

02:38:30.734 --> 02:38:33.770
BUSINESS TO TRANSCEND JUSTICE.

02:38:33.837 --> 02:38:36.607
HAVE I PRETENDED TO HEAR.

02:38:36.673 --> 02:38:38.475

IN FAIRLY.

02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:58.362
I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE

02:38:58.428 --> 02:38:59.930
AUDIT DOES NOT ELABORATE THE

02:38:59.997 --> 02:39:01.932

02:39:29.226 --> 02:39:30.961
PROCEEDINGS BE ISSUED.

02:39:31.028 --> 02:39:32.896
CONSEQUENTLY JUDGES DO NOT

02:39:32.963 --> 02:39:35.732
DEVELOP COMPLETELY EXCULPATORY

02:39:35.799 --> 02:39:37.367

INVESTIGATION WHICH COULD BE

02:39:47.544 --> 02:39:50.147
PART OF THE INITIAL STEPS OF AN

02:39:50.213 --> 02:39:51.715
INVESTIGATION.

02:39:51.782 --> 02:39:53.517

02:40:02.926 --> 02:40:04.695
A PRE FILING PHASE IN THE

02:40:04.761 --> 02:40:07.164

SHORT OF DISCIPLINE.

02:40:23.847 --> 02:40:25.082
IN FACT.

02:40:25.148 --> 02:40:26.550
THE AUDITOR GIVES A NOD TO THE

REMEDIAL JUSTICE.

02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:39.029

ALLERGY IN THESE CASES.

02:40:43.367 --> 02:40:44.101
AS THE STATISTICS BEAR OUT MOST

02:40:44.167 --> 02:40:45.802
COMPLAINTS ARE DISMISSED BUT IN

02:40:45.869 --> 02:40:47.471
THOSE INSTANCES WHERE A

02:40:47.537 --> 02:40:48.705

AND LEAD TO UNFAIR CRITICISM AND

02:40:59.683 --> 02:41:01.518
FALSE CLAIMS AND RESULT IN THE

02:41:01.585 --> 02:41:03.787

CHALLENGES TO JUDGE BASED UPON

02:41:07.424 --> 02:41:09.092
AN INCOMPLETE FACTUAL RECORD.

02:41:09.159 --> 02:41:10.093
THE PRESERVATION OF

02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:12.129
CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTS THE

02:41:12.195 --> 02:41:13.663
INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS FOR ALL

02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:15.665

REHABILITATE BEHAVIOR.

02:41:30.714 --> 02:41:32.049
THE RECENTLY INITIATED MENTORING

LASTLY THE AUDIT RECOMMENDS

02:41:54.004 --> 02:41:55.205
REORGANIZATION AND RESTART.

02:41:55.272 --> 02:41:57.174
THE CGPA.

02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:58.775
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

02:41:58.842 --> 02:41:59.910
THE VOTERS A CALIFORNIA IN

02:41:59.976 --> 02:42:02.479
APPROVED A MAJOR REFORMULATION

02:42:02.546 --> 02:42:04.981
OF THIS CGP AND ESTABLISH A

02:42:05.048 --> 02:42:07.384
SYSTEM WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE

02:42:07.451 --> 02:42:10.287
COMMISSIONERS ARE PUBLIC MEMBERS.

02:42:10.353 --> 02:42:12.355
THEY HAVE A SUPER MAJORITY.

02:42:12.422 --> 02:42:14.224
ONLY THREE OF ELEVEN MEMBERS ARE

02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:15.792
JUDGES.

02:42:15.859 --> 02:42:18.228
THE VOTERS INTENDED IN NINETEEN

02:42:18.295 --> 02:42:18.795

VOICES OF JUDGES UNDERSEA JP.

02:42:21.198 --> 02:42:23.066
IS CRITICAL.

02:42:23.133 --> 02:42:25.368
TOWARDS ENSURING FAIRNESS.

02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:27.270
JUDGES ARE ALWAYS BOUND BY THE

02:42:27.337 --> 02:42:28.738
CODE OF JUDICIAL ETHICS

02:42:28.805 --> 02:42:29.906

02:42:34.177 --> 02:42:36.046
FOR SPECIAL MASTERS.

02:42:36.113 --> 02:42:37.080
AND I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT

02:42:37.147 --> 02:42:38.415
SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD IN

02:42:38.482 --> 02:42:39.549
THAT IS THAT.

02:42:39.616 --> 02:42:42.385
SPECIAL MASTERS DO NOT IMPOSE

02:42:42.452 --> 02:42:43.553
DISCIPLINE.

02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:44.988
THAT IS THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF

02:42:45.055 --> 02:42:46.656
THE COMMISSION.

02:42:46.723 --> 02:42:48.758
THE SPECIAL MASTERS CONDUCT

02:42:48.825 --> 02:42:50.961
FINDINGS OF FACT AND MAKE

02:42:51.027 --> 02:42:52.329
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.

02:42:52.395 --> 02:42:54.231
THEY DO NOT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:42:54.297 --> 02:42:56.433
UPON DISCIPLINE.

02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:58.869
AND I MIGHT FURTHER AT THAT LAST

02:42:58.935 --> 02:43:00.770
YEAR THERE WERE TWO PUBLIC

02:43:00.837 --> 02:43:02.706
HEARINGS ONLY TWO INSTANCES OUT

02:43:06.109 --> 02:43:06.309
HEARING.

02:43:06.376 --> 02:43:09.412

02:43:09.479 --> 02:43:11.314
THAT SPEND GOING.

02:43:11.381 --> 02:43:12.315
FOR THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER

WHEN I PRACTICED LAW IT WAS

02:45:38.595 --> 02:45:39.496
ALWAYS VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN I

02:45:39.562 --> 02:45:40.130
HAD TO WAIT?

02:45:40.196 --> 02:45:42.465
A PRO PER LITIGANT. TO CONCLUDE

THEIR APPEARANCE UP FREQUENTLY

02:45:45.402 --> 02:45:46.936
THE JUDGES WOULD END UP HAVING

02:45:47.003 --> 02:45:48.071
TO EXPLAIN WHAT RULES OF

02:45:48.138 --> 02:45:51.441
EVIDENCE ARE -- IT'S REALLY -- I

02:45:51.508 --> 02:45:52.909
THINK A VERY CHALLENGING

02:45:52.976 --> 02:45:54.577
POSITION TO BE AND CERTAINLY IS

02:45:54.644 --> 02:45:56.546
AN ATTORNEY WAITING. TO BE ABLE

02:45:56.613 --> 02:45:57.747

CLIENT TO WAS PAYING ME FOR MY

JUDICIAL PROCESS SHE IS -- CAN

02:46:09.759 --> 02:46:11.328
BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND WHEN

02:46:11.394 --> 02:46:13.563
YOU HAVE A LARGE A CALENDAR OF

02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:17.367
CASES BEFORE YOU I CAN CERTAINLY

02:46:17.434 --> 02:46:20.403
UNDERSTAND WHY -- MIGHT PERCEIVE

02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:21.004
THAT COURTS GET IMPATIENT AND

02:46:21.071 --> 02:46:24.874
FRANKLY THEY PROBABLY DO -- AND

02:46:24.941 --> 02:46:25.575
THEY ARE.

02:46:25.642 --> 02:46:26.710
YOU KNOW HUMAN BEINGS AND FOR

02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:28.712
ALL SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES OF

02:46:28.778 --> 02:46:32.982
OUR HUMANITY -- WHICH BRINGS ME

02:46:33.049 --> 02:46:34.951
TO A POINT I IT IT SEEMS TO ME

02:46:35.018 --> 02:46:37.387
THAT. ONE OF THE CRITICAL

02:46:37.454 --> 02:46:39.422
COMPONENTS HERE IS TO TRY TO

02:46:39.489 --> 02:46:41.291
ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE

02:46:41.358 --> 02:46:43.226
THEY RISE TO A LEVEL.

02:46:43.293 --> 02:46:44.661
OF DISCIPLINE.

02:46:44.728 --> 02:46:45.729
I DON'T THINK WE'RE EVER GOING

02:46:45.795 --> 02:46:48.365
TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.

02:46:48.431 --> 02:46:51.267
AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATE EVERY

02:46:51.334 --> 02:46:54.504
CASE -- AND I THINK THAT THE

02:46:54.571 --> 02:46:55.505
MAJOR.

02:46:55.572 --> 02:46:58.041
HAVE SPECIAL MASTERS ARE USUALLY

02:46:58.108 --> 02:46:59.709
IN PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS

02:46:59.776 --> 02:47:02.545
CIRCUMSTANCES -- MOST OF THE

02:47:02.612 --> 02:47:05.982
SITUATIONS I EITHER GET RESOLVED

02:47:06.049 --> 02:47:07.650
OR COULD BE RESOLVED IT SEEMS TO

02:47:07.717 --> 02:47:08.218
ME.

02:47:08.284 --> 02:47:10.820
WITH EARLY INTERVENTION IF YOU

02:47:10.887 --> 02:47:12.689
WILL THAT THERE ARE FOR EXAMPLE

02:47:12.756 --> 02:47:14.391
CONCERNS -- BY A NUMBER OF

02:47:14.457 --> 02:47:16.393
PEOPLE -- THAT A JUDGE'S

02:47:16.459 --> 02:47:19.596
BEHAVIOR IS INAPPROPRIATE AGAIN

02:47:19.662 --> 02:47:20.964
I MENTION THAT ONE CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:23.299
I RECALL WERE JUDGE BETWEEN

02:47:23.366 --> 02:47:23.967
ELEVEN THIRTY AND TWELVE O'CLOCK

02:47:24.033 --> 02:47:26.836
IN THE MORNING -- WAS ACTUALLY

02:47:26.903 --> 02:47:30.373
ON IMPOSSIBLE -- AND IT TURNED

02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:31.641
OUT IT'S BECAUSE HE HAD VERY LOW

02:47:31.708 --> 02:47:32.609
BLOOD SUGAR WAS I THINK WAS

02:47:32.675 --> 02:47:34.544
DIABETIC IT'S MANY MANY YEARS

02:47:34.611 --> 02:47:35.945
AGO HE'S LONG DECEASED.

02:47:36.012 --> 02:47:38.248
BUT IF SOMEONE HAD INTERVENED

02:47:38.314 --> 02:47:39.682
EARLY AND SAY THEIR COMPLAINTS

02:47:39.749 --> 02:47:41.351
JUST GRAB A SANDWICH ELEVEN

02:47:41.418 --> 02:47:44.087
O'CLOCK I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE

02:47:44.154 --> 02:47:46.022
A TAKING CARE OF A PART OF THE

02:47:46.089 --> 02:47:47.290
THE PROBLEM NOW NOT ALL THE

02:47:47.357 --> 02:47:48.992
SITUATIONS ARE THAT EASY TO

02:47:49.058 --> 02:47:53.596
RESOLVE BUT I'M WONDERING -- AT

02:47:53.663 --> 02:47:54.998
IF YOU COULD TO AND PERHAPS

02:47:55.064 --> 02:47:55.765
SOMEONE.

02:47:55.832 --> 02:47:57.434
OTHER THAN THE JUDGE IF THEY

02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:59.536
KNOW BETTER -- IS THERE A

02:47:59.602 --> 02:48:00.804
PROCESS NOW.

02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:02.772
WHERE WE CAN HAVE THAT EARLIER

02:48:02.839 --> 02:48:04.407
INTERVENTION -- IS THIS

02:48:04.474 --> 02:48:06.376
SOMETHING THAT THE AUDITOR

02:48:06.443 --> 02:48:09.979
RECOMMENDS IN IN HER REPORT.

02:48:10.046 --> 02:48:12.582
OFTENTIMES EARLY INTERVENTION

02:48:12.649 --> 02:48:15.251
SAVES A LOT OF GRIEF OF FOR THE

02:48:15.318 --> 02:48:17.954
LITIGANTS FOR THE JUDGE FOR THE

02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:20.423
JUDGES -- STAFF I CHOSE BEING

02:48:20.490 --> 02:48:21.758
MADE AWARE.

02:48:21.825 --> 02:48:23.426
AND THE FACT THAT THE BEHAVIOR

02:48:23.493 --> 02:48:25.995
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT -- THERE

02:48:26.062 --> 02:48:27.430
HAVE TO BE CHANGES MADE AND

02:48:27.497 --> 02:48:28.698
WHETHER THERE CAN BE TWO

02:48:28.765 --> 02:48:30.633
ADDITIONAL TRAINING -- IS THAT

02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:34.537
SOMETHING THAT IS ON THE TABLE

02:48:34.604 --> 02:48:35.872
HERE RIGHT NOW.

02:48:35.939 --> 02:48:39.108
WE COULD WE DO SHOULD DO MORE.

02:48:39.175 --> 02:48:40.877
TO TO CREATE THAT I KNOW -- THE

02:48:40.944 --> 02:48:42.846
JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN THE COURT OF

02:48:42.912 --> 02:48:45.048
A TRIES TO DO THAT THE STATE BAR

02:48:45.114 --> 02:48:46.149
NOW WE DO WE TRY TO HAVE

02:48:46.216 --> 02:48:48.418
PROGRAMS ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF

02:48:48.485 --> 02:48:50.019
BEHAVIORAL TRAINING.

02:48:50.086 --> 02:48:51.754
ABOUT THE CPAP BEING A UNIQUE

02:48:51.821 --> 02:48:55.191
CREATURE IS THAT IS THAT --

02:48:55.258 --> 02:48:57.427
OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE UNDER THE

02:48:57.494 --> 02:48:59.229
CURRENT LAW OR IS THAT SOMETHING

02:48:59.295 --> 02:49:01.097
ELSE THAT HAS TO GET CHANGED

02:49:01.164 --> 02:49:01.764
THROUGH A CONSTITUTIONAL

02:49:01.831 --> 02:49:03.266
AMENDMENT.

02:49:03.333 --> 02:49:05.969
I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE MICHAEL

02:49:06.035 --> 02:49:07.070
PANELS TO ADDRESS THAT RIGHT.

02:49:07.136 --> 02:49:10.006
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD

02:49:10.073 --> 02:49:11.608
LIKE TO SHARE -- FROM THE

02:49:11.674 --> 02:49:13.309
JUDGE'S PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THIS

02:49:13.376 --> 02:49:14.611
AND MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

02:49:14.677 --> 02:49:21.150
ABOUT IS -- JUDGES -- PRACTICING.

02:49:21.217 --> 02:49:24.921
THOUGHTFUL DEEP SELF AWARENESS.

02:49:24.988 --> 02:49:26.422
AND THAT IS CRITICAL ABOUT

02:49:26.489 --> 02:49:29.592
HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT --

02:49:29.659 --> 02:49:31.661
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH --

02:49:31.728 --> 02:49:34.631
YOURSELF AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

02:49:34.697 --> 02:49:37.100
SO THAT YOU CAN PRACTICE THE THE

02:49:37.166 --> 02:49:38.334
DEGREE OF PATIENCE IS THAT'S

02:49:38.401 --> 02:49:39.702
APPROPRIATE.

02:49:39.769 --> 02:49:41.838
IN EVERY SINGLE CASE SO THAT YOU

02:49:41.905 --> 02:49:44.908
CAN -- MAKE SURE THAT -- THE

02:49:44.974 --> 02:49:46.876
MAJORITY OF CASES THAT WE HAVE

02:49:46.943 --> 02:49:48.278
WHO ARE SELF REPRESENTED

02:49:48.344 --> 02:49:51.714
LITIGANTS -- FEEL THAT THAT THAT

02:49:51.781 --> 02:49:54.284
THEY HAVE -- HAD THE DUE PROCESS

02:49:54.350 --> 02:49:55.952
THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO SO THE

02:49:56.019 --> 02:49:59.756
QUESTION THEN IS IS THE ARE THE

02:49:59.822 --> 02:50:01.858
TOOLS TO IT FOR A JUDGE TO

02:50:01.925 --> 02:50:02.825
ENGAGE AND THOUGHTFUL SHOP

02:50:02.892 --> 02:50:03.726
WORKERS.

02:50:03.793 --> 02:50:05.428
ARE THOSE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IF

02:50:05.495 --> 02:50:07.997
WE WERE GOING TO SAY AS WE FOCUS

02:50:08.064 --> 02:50:09.532
ON THE CGP AS WE FOCUS ON

02:50:09.599 --> 02:50:10.733
JUDICIAL CONDUCT.

02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:13.036
LET'S TRY TO ADDRESS WHAT ARE

02:50:13.102 --> 02:50:14.637
LIKELY TO BE SOME OF THE

02:50:14.704 --> 02:50:17.206
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT ARISE

02:50:17.273 --> 02:50:18.908
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT.

02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:22.478
SUCH A 75% OF THE LITIGANTS ARE

02:50:22.545 --> 02:50:24.347
ARE SELF REPRESENTED AND DON'T

02:50:24.414 --> 02:50:25.882
KNOW THE RULES OF EVIDENCE AND

02:50:25.949 --> 02:50:27.817
DON'T KNOW CIVILITY IN A COURT

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:29.319
ROOM MORE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ARE

02:50:29.385 --> 02:50:30.787
THOSE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY

02:50:30.853 --> 02:50:33.056
AVAILABLE AND IF SO WHO PROMOTE.

02:50:33.122 --> 02:50:35.024
PROVIDES THEM THE CGA HAS A

02:50:35.091 --> 02:50:38.361
ROBUST EDUCATION PROGRAM WHERE

02:50:38.428 --> 02:50:39.829
WE CONDUCT CONFERENCES WE HAVE

02:50:39.896 --> 02:50:40.530
WEAPON ARE.

02:50:40.597 --> 02:50:43.366
A LOT OF OF OUTREACH AND

02:50:43.433 --> 02:50:45.935
TRAINING IN A LOCAL COURTS ARE

02:50:46.002 --> 02:50:48.037
DOING THIS IN INDIVIDUAL COURTS

02:50:48.104 --> 02:50:49.038
ARE ALSO DOING THIS IN AN

02:50:49.105 --> 02:50:50.106
INFORMAL WAY.

02:50:50.173 --> 02:50:51.808
SO THAT THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS

02:50:51.874 --> 02:50:53.042
WITH COLLEAGUES TO DO THAT

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:54.377
FURTHERMORE.

02:50:54.444 --> 02:50:56.245
THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL --

02:50:56.312 --> 02:50:59.015
EDUCATION WHICH IS -- JUDICIAL

02:50:59.082 --> 02:51:01.084
COUNCIL DIVISION THEY HAVE A

02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:03.486
ROBUST EDUCATION COMPONENT.

02:51:03.553 --> 02:51:04.821
THAT ADDRESSES EXACTLY WHAT

02:51:04.887 --> 02:51:06.055
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THERE IS

02:51:06.122 --> 02:51:10.893
A LOT OF ROBUST EDUCATION ON

02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:13.463
THIS.

02:51:13.529 --> 02:51:15.565
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FROM

02:51:15.632 --> 02:51:17.133
THE C. K. PLEASE [inaudible]

02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:20.570
ONE YOUR HERE AGAIN I I DON'T

02:51:20.637 --> 02:51:21.871
KNOW WHETHER CHAIRED BY MY

02:51:21.938 --> 02:51:22.472
COLLEAGUES BUT I STILL BELIEVE

02:51:22.538 --> 02:51:23.239
AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH

02:51:23.306 --> 02:51:25.908
A POUND OF CURE AND AND I ALSO

02:51:25.975 --> 02:51:28.144
DO KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE

02:51:28.211 --> 02:51:29.879
PROGRAMS ARE.

02:51:29.946 --> 02:51:32.649
THOROUGHLY INEFFECTIVE -- SO IF

02:51:32.715 --> 02:51:35.184
WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER

02:51:35.251 --> 02:51:36.786
OF COMPLETION OF MY COMPLAINTS

02:51:36.853 --> 02:51:38.655
THAT COME BEFORE GOING TO CHANGE

02:51:38.721 --> 02:51:39.422
THE BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE

02:51:39.489 --> 02:51:41.391
COURTROOM -- SO THAT LITIGANTS

02:51:41.457 --> 02:51:42.592
FEEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN HEARD IN

02:51:42.659 --> 02:51:43.893
MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT'S WHAT

02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:45.061
LITIGANTS WANT.

02:51:45.128 --> 02:51:46.596
EVEN IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY

02:51:46.663 --> 02:51:47.530
AGREE WITH THEM THEY WANT THEIR

02:51:47.597 --> 02:51:49.198
DAY IN COURT THEY WANT TO BE

02:51:49.265 --> 02:51:51.401
HEARD THEY WANT TO BE RESPECTED --

02:51:51.467 --> 02:51:54.804
WHAT IS AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN

02:51:54.871 --> 02:51:55.638
ASSURE THAT THE?

02:51:55.705 --> 02:51:57.373
INJUSTICE THAT THE PUBLIC SEES

02:51:57.440 --> 02:52:01.344
IS A CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEIR

02:52:01.411 --> 02:52:03.312
EXPECTATIONS.

02:52:03.379 --> 02:52:05.148
SO IT THIS AYE AYE HERE'S WHAT I

02:52:05.214 --> 02:52:05.748
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION TO BE

02:52:05.815 --> 02:52:08.251
WAS WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE

02:52:08.317 --> 02:52:10.687
COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY -- TO

02:52:10.753 --> 02:52:16.526
ORDER -- NON DISCIPLINARY -- BUT

02:52:16.592 --> 02:52:19.295
EDUCATION ROLE OR THINGS THAT

02:52:19.362 --> 02:52:20.496
WOULD HELP JUDGES IMPROVE THE

02:52:20.563 --> 02:52:21.330
COMMISSION DOESN'T HAVE THE

02:52:21.397 --> 02:52:23.499
AUTHORITY TO DO THAT -- THE WHAT

02:52:23.566 --> 02:52:25.768
THE COMMISSION CAN DO IS DEFINED

02:52:25.835 --> 02:52:26.736
IN THE CONSTITUTION THE

02:52:26.803 --> 02:52:28.705
COMMISSION DOES NOT NOW HAVE THE

02:52:28.771 --> 02:52:31.841

SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT -- AND

02:52:39.916 --> 02:52:42.719
HAVE THAT BE -- NON DISCIPLINARY

02:52:42.785 --> 02:52:43.953
SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:46.856
WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDED TO THE

02:52:46.923 --> 02:52:49.525
COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY THANK YOU.

02:52:49.592 --> 02:52:51.828
LET ME ASK JUST ON THAT.

02:52:51.894 --> 02:52:54.430
BECAUSE I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR.

02:52:54.497 --> 02:52:57.567
IZZARD OPPORTUNITY FOR A JUDGE

02:52:57.633 --> 02:52:59.469

02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:19.889
SOMEONE CAN TELL THE JUDGE.

02:53:19.956 --> 02:53:21.257
THE COMPLAINTS FOR YOUR HERE THE

02:53:21.324 --> 02:53:22.625
AVERAGES HERE MAYBE THERE'S

02:53:22.692 --> 02:53:24.260
SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND

02:53:24.327 --> 02:53:27.163
GO -- TO OF THESE EDUCATION

02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:28.131
PROGRAMS AND WHAT NOT.

02:53:28.197 --> 02:53:29.832
THERE'S NOTHING -- SPECIFICALLY

02:53:29.899 --> 02:53:31.300
LIKE THAT BUT THE COMMISSION

02:53:31.367 --> 02:53:33.469
DOES HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT AND

02:53:33.536 --> 02:53:35.004
IN THE ANNUAL REPORT.

02:53:35.071 --> 02:53:37.740
THERE ARE -- THERE ARE FULSOME

02:53:37.807 --> 02:53:40.543
SUMMARIES OF PUBLIC DISCIPLINE.

02:53:40.610 --> 02:53:43.045
AND THERE ARE A BRIEF SUMMARIES

02:53:43.112 --> 02:53:45.715
OF OF CONFIDENTIAL DISCIPLINE SO

02:53:45.782 --> 02:53:47.183
THEY HAVE TO BE BRIEF BECAUSE

02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:48.151
BECAUSE THE DISCIPLINE WAS

02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:50.119
CONFIDENTIAL BUT THERE IS ENOUGH

02:53:50.186 --> 02:53:52.755
INFORMATION IN THERE. FOR A

02:53:52.822 --> 02:53:55.758
JUDGE TO SEE -- WHAT CONDUCT

02:53:55.825 --> 02:53:57.393
THAT WARRANTED DISCIPLINE WE

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:59.762
ALSO HAVE A ROBUST INFORMATION

02:53:59.829 --> 02:54:03.199
ABOUT -- PRIOR DISCIPLINE ON OUR

02:54:03.266 --> 02:54:04.600
WEBSITE BUT WE HAVE BEEN IN

02:54:04.667 --> 02:54:05.902
ORDER PORT EVERY YEAR AND WE

02:54:05.968 --> 02:54:08.871
SEND IT TO EVERY SINGLE JUDGE IN

02:54:08.938 --> 02:54:09.705
THE STATE AS WELL AS YOU ALL

02:54:09.772 --> 02:54:11.140
MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO

02:54:11.207 --> 02:54:12.108
COMMENT THAT.

02:54:12.175 --> 02:54:12.608
JUDGES HAVE THE ETHICAL

02:54:12.675 --> 02:54:18.481
OBLIGATION TO SELF REPORT.

02:54:18.548 --> 02:54:20.850
AND THERE MAY BE SOME -- THE

02:54:20.917 --> 02:54:22.819
APPEARANCE OF THE ETHICAL

02:54:22.885 --> 02:54:23.753
TRANSGRESSION.

02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:25.488
SO WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION AND WE

02:54:25.555 --> 02:54:25.755
DO THAT.

02:54:25.822 --> 02:54:27.523
AND SECOND WITH RESPECT TO THIS

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:31.027
MATTER OF HOW WE MIGHT -- PER TO

02:54:31.093 --> 02:54:33.329
ENHANCE AND BOLSTER --

02:54:33.396 --> 02:54:34.564
EDUCATIONAL.

02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:36.232
REMEDIATION AND AND THINGS OF

02:54:36.299 --> 02:54:38.701
THAT SORT SHORT OF DISCIPLINE IF

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:40.736
THAT'S NOT WITHIN THE STATUTORY

02:54:40.803 --> 02:54:42.572
PURVIEW OR CONSTITUTIONAL

02:54:42.638 --> 02:54:43.573
PURVIEW OF THE COMMISSION AS IT

02:54:43.639 --> 02:54:46.075
STANDS NOW.

02:54:46.142 --> 02:54:47.677
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

02:54:47.743 --> 02:54:50.413
MANY JUDGES WHO FEEL THAT THE

02:54:50.479 --> 02:54:51.414
STRESS OF THAT PARTICULAR

02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:52.949
ASSIGNMENT IS NOT WELL SUITED

02:54:53.015 --> 02:54:54.483
FOR THEM.

02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:56.085
ASKED TO BE REASSIGNED AND SO

02:54:56.152 --> 02:54:58.287
THERE IS A LOT OF SUPERVISION

02:54:58.354 --> 02:55:00.590
OVERSIGHT OVER THE CONDUCT

02:55:00.656 --> 02:55:02.625
BEHAVIOR OF JUDGES BECAUSE AT

02:55:02.692 --> 02:55:03.559
THE FRONT LINE.

02:55:03.626 --> 02:55:04.927
THE COURTS ARE CONSTANTLY

02:55:04.994 --> 02:55:07.597
RECEIVING FEEDBACK AND INPUT --

02:55:07.663 --> 02:55:09.899
FROM LITIGANTS FROM ATTORNEYS

02:55:09.966 --> 02:55:13.236
FROM STAFF MEMBERS WITH RESPECT --

02:55:13.302 --> 02:55:14.670
TO WHAT'S TRANSPIRING IN THE

02:55:14.737 --> 02:55:15.438
COURT ROOM.

02:55:15.504 --> 02:55:20.309
AND SO THERE IS A LOT OF

02:55:20.376 --> 02:55:23.312
DISCUSSION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:55:23.379 --> 02:55:25.781
CORRECTIVE ACTION BEFORE IT GETS

02:55:25.848 --> 02:55:26.849
AT THE COMMISSION LEVEL AND WE

02:55:26.916 --> 02:55:29.785
DO -- WE DO THAT KIND OF THING

02:55:29.852 --> 02:55:31.220
UP AND DOWN THE STATE.

02:55:31.287 --> 02:55:32.822
WATER AND WITH THAT THE THE

02:55:32.889 --> 02:55:33.856
PRESIDING I'M SORRY AS OF THE

02:55:33.923 --> 02:55:35.791
SUPERVISING JUDGE SUPERVISING

02:55:35.858 --> 02:55:38.227
JUDGE JUDGE HERE IN THE SYSTEM

02:55:38.294 --> 02:55:41.931
TO IN SOME CAPACITY RIGHT GOT IT

02:55:41.998 --> 02:55:43.532
WORK IT'S TELLING. TO ANOTHER

02:55:43.599 --> 02:55:44.867
COLLEAGUE WHO MAY BE A SENIOR

02:55:44.934 --> 02:55:46.335
JUDICIAL OFFICER TO ASSIST AND

02:55:46.402 --> 02:55:47.970
AND HELP OUT IN A YOU COULD SAY

02:55:48.037 --> 02:55:49.705
IN A MENTORING FASHION THAT WE

02:55:49.772 --> 02:55:50.740
HAVE.

02:55:50.806 --> 02:55:53.276
ESTABLISHED INFORMALLY WITHIN

02:55:53.342 --> 02:55:54.410
OUR OWN COURTS.

02:55:54.477 --> 02:55:55.411
I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM

02:55:55.478 --> 02:55:56.779
THOUGH IS THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION

02:55:56.846 --> 02:55:58.347
IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND SO I

02:55:58.414 --> 02:55:59.916
THINK WE HAVE TO BE MORE EARNEST

02:55:59.982 --> 02:56:01.450
AND MORE EFFECTIVE.

02:56:01.517 --> 02:56:03.452
IN THOSE PROCEDURES AND AS I

02:56:03.519 --> 02:56:08.658
LOOK BACK -- I A NUMBER OF THE

02:56:08.724 --> 02:56:09.759
IN PLAIN SAID THAT I HEARD AND

02:56:09.825 --> 02:56:11.027
FELT MYSELF WHEN I WAS

02:56:11.093 --> 02:56:12.528
PRACTICING WHICH SHALL BE IT IS

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:14.630
A LONG TIME AGO.

02:56:14.697 --> 02:56:15.798
IS SOME OF THE IMPLICIT BIAS.

02:56:15.865 --> 02:56:18.367
GENDER BASED BIAS RACIALLY BASED

02:56:18.434 --> 02:56:22.338
BIAS -- AND THOSE ARE THE KINDS

02:56:22.405 --> 02:56:24.507
OF THINGS THAT -- REALLY DO

02:56:24.573 --> 02:56:26.309
UNDERMINE -- THE PUBLIC

02:56:26.375 --> 02:56:28.711
PERCEPTION OF THE COURTS AND SO --

02:56:28.778 --> 02:56:30.046
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE

02:56:30.112 --> 02:56:31.614
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING

02:56:31.681 --> 02:56:33.416
IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A

02:56:33.482 --> 02:56:35.551
VERY ROBUST AND EFFECTIVE

02:56:35.618 --> 02:56:36.419
PROGRAM.

02:56:36.485 --> 02:56:39.088
A TO ADDRESS IMPLICIT BIAS -- TO

02:56:39.155 --> 02:56:40.556
ADDRESS THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR

02:56:40.623 --> 02:56:41.991
THAT.

02:56:42.058 --> 02:56:44.760
RESULTS IN THE PUBLIC BELIEVING

02:56:44.827 --> 02:56:47.663
THAT A PARTICULAR JUDGE.

02:56:47.730 --> 02:56:50.032
IS -- BIASED AGAINST CERTAIN

02:56:50.099 --> 02:56:53.102
LITIGANTS -- BECAUSE PUT PART OF

02:56:53.169 --> 02:56:54.904
THE MY CONCERN TO IS A JUDGE'S

02:56:54.971 --> 02:56:55.905
BECOME OF WE HAVE AN ELECTED

02:56:55.972 --> 02:56:57.073
JUDICIAL PROCESS HERE IN

02:56:57.139 --> 02:56:58.040
CALIFORNIA.

02:56:58.107 --> 02:56:59.408
I WANT YOUR JUST TO ENFORCE THE

02:56:59.475 --> 02:57:01.243
LAW AND NOT TO WORRY ABOUT

02:57:01.310 --> 02:57:02.712
WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE

02:57:02.778 --> 02:57:03.813
GOING TO GET REELECTED OR

02:57:03.879 --> 02:57:05.114
WHETHER OR NOT THE COMMISSION ON

02:57:05.181 --> 02:57:06.782
JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE IS GONNA

02:57:06.849 --> 02:57:09.618
PUBLICLY -- CHALLENGE THEM -- SO

02:57:09.685 --> 02:57:11.420
THAT THEY ARE AFRAID TO DO WHAT

02:57:11.487 --> 02:57:13.322
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO BECAUSE

02:57:13.389 --> 02:57:14.557
OF THEIR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR

02:57:14.623 --> 02:57:16.959
JOBS OR THESE ARE JUST PEOPLE.

02:57:17.026 --> 02:57:18.461
AND WHEN WE SEE THIS HAPPEN.

02:57:18.527 --> 02:57:19.662
THE QUESTION TO ME IS COULD WE

02:57:19.729 --> 02:57:22.832
HAVE -- COULD WE HAVE INTERVENED

02:57:22.898 --> 02:57:24.500
BEFORE WE GOT TO THAT LEVEL

02:57:24.567 --> 02:57:26.135
BECAUSE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE

02:57:26.202 --> 02:57:28.371
JUDICIARY IS CRITICAL IF WE'RE

02:57:28.437 --> 02:57:31.574
GONNA HAVE COURT A COURT SYSTEM

02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:32.174
THAT FUNCTIONS AS SHE WILL NOW

02:57:32.241 --> 02:57:32.341
SO.

02:57:32.408 --> 02:57:37.780
I CAN SAY THAT CJ'S MINDFUL OF

02:57:37.847 --> 02:57:39.715
AB -- TWO FORTY TWO WHICH IT WAS

02:57:39.782 --> 02:57:42.118
AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO BROADEN --

02:57:42.184 --> 02:57:44.053
EDUCATION -- FOR LEGAL

02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:46.689
PROFESSIONALS AND FOR JUDGES AND

02:57:46.756 --> 02:57:49.558
IN FACT JUST YESTERDAY -- CGA

02:57:49.625 --> 02:57:52.895
HAD A HAD A MEETING WITH -- OUR

02:57:52.962 --> 02:57:56.032
TASK FORCE ON GENDER RACIAL AND

02:57:56.098 --> 02:57:58.000
ETHNIC FAIRNESS IN THE COURTS

02:57:58.067 --> 02:57:59.769
AND SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN

02:57:59.835 --> 02:58:01.170
PLANNING AND DEVELOPING.

02:58:01.237 --> 02:58:03.172
MORE ROBUST -- TREATING IN

02:58:03.239 --> 02:58:05.307
EDUCATION ON IMPLICIT BIASES

02:58:05.374 --> 02:58:08.444
ADDITIONALLY THE CHIEF JUSTICE --

02:58:08.511 --> 02:58:12.448
HAS SET CREATED A TASK.

02:58:12.515 --> 02:58:13.649
FOR AND HARASSMENT -- AND ITS

02:58:13.716 --> 02:58:14.650
RECOMMENDATIONS WILL SOON BE

02:58:14.717 --> 02:58:16.519
COMING OUT IN JULY -- WHICH WILL

02:58:16.585 --> 02:58:18.954
CONTAIN A NUMBER OF OF

02:58:19.021 --> 02:58:22.892
EDUCATIONAL -- IDEAS THAT WE CAN

02:58:22.958 --> 02:58:24.827
IMPLEMENT SO MY LAST QUESTION IS

02:58:24.894 --> 02:58:27.496
IS THERE ANY WAY FOR THE C. J.

02:58:27.563 --> 02:58:30.666
P. TO BE WORKING WITH THE CGA OR

02:58:30.733 --> 02:58:31.901
THE COURT SO THE CHIEF FOR ANY

02:58:31.967 --> 02:58:35.438
OF THE OTHER -- COURT FOCUSED

02:58:35.504 --> 02:58:38.040
ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:58:38.107 --> 02:58:41.777
HAVE A ROBUST AND COMPETENT --

02:58:41.844 --> 02:58:43.712
EDUCATIONAL PROCESS AND OTHER

02:58:43.779 --> 02:58:45.114
REMEDIAL.

02:58:45.181 --> 02:58:46.982
EFFORTS TO INTERVENE AT AN

02:58:47.049 --> 02:58:48.751
EARLIER STAGE SO THAT WE DON'T

02:58:48.818 --> 02:58:50.319
END UP.

02:58:50.386 --> 02:58:52.721
WITH -- HAVING TO GO THROUGH A

02:58:52.788 --> 02:58:54.690
PROCESS WITH SPECIAL MASTERS

02:58:54.757 --> 02:58:56.392
WITH WHAT HAVE YOU THAT THAT WE

02:58:56.459 --> 02:58:58.294
CAN DO EARLY INTERVENTION THE

02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:01.630
JUDGES DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

02:59:01.697 --> 02:59:02.631
NECESSARILY ABOUT.

02:59:02.698 --> 02:59:04.633
WHETHER WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:05.167
GOING TO RESULT IN THEM.

02:59:05.234 --> 02:59:08.037
LOSING THEIR JOBS I MEAN.

02:59:08.104 --> 02:59:09.538
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE WE

02:59:09.605 --> 02:59:10.639
HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS

02:59:10.706 --> 02:59:11.640
THAT ARE TRYING THAT ARE

02:59:11.707 --> 02:59:13.542
DESIGNED TO TRY TO REACH THE

02:59:13.609 --> 02:59:15.010
SAME GOAL.

02:59:15.077 --> 02:59:17.012
IS THERE ANY INTERACTION OR IT

02:59:17.079 --> 02:59:19.248
IS A SYSTEM DESIGNED TO EXCLUDE

02:59:19.315 --> 02:59:21.050
THAT KIND OF INTERACTION MAYBE

02:59:21.117 --> 02:59:22.952
THIS QUESTIONS AS ARE MANY

02:59:23.018 --> 02:59:25.321
STAKEHOLDERS AS YOU POINTED OUT --

02:59:25.387 --> 02:59:27.223
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING --

02:59:27.289 --> 02:59:30.192
MISTER DRESSLER A MAYBE ABOUT --

02:59:30.259 --> 02:59:32.795
SIX WEEKS AGO -- WHEN HE WAS AT

02:59:32.862 --> 02:59:35.030
A CONFERENCE -- THAT WAS IT THAT

02:59:35.097 --> 02:59:37.700
IT WHICH I WAS INVITED TO ATTEND

02:59:37.766 --> 02:59:40.603
AS WELL AS THE DEFENSE COUNSEL.

02:59:40.669 --> 02:59:43.105
WHO -- APPEAR REGULARLY BEFORE

02:59:43.172 --> 02:59:45.174
THE COMMISSION AND SO IT WAS A

02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:47.276
FORM -- BY WHICH STAKEHOLDERS

02:59:47.343 --> 02:59:48.911
COULD PARTICIPATE IN THE

02:59:48.978 --> 02:59:52.181
IMPORTANT ISSUES -- WITH THE CJ

02:59:52.248 --> 02:59:53.382
PAEAN SO CERTAINLY THERE ARE

02:59:53.449 --> 02:59:55.417
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO TO

02:59:55.484 --> 02:59:56.252
PURSUE THOSE KINDS A

02:59:56.318 --> 02:59:58.087
CONVERSATION BUT I WONDER FROM

02:59:58.154 --> 03:00:00.523
THE C. JP'S PERSPECTIVE IS THIS

03:00:00.589 --> 03:00:01.690
SOMETHING OUTS AND CURRENTLY

03:00:01.757 --> 03:00:03.292
OBVIOUSLY OUTSIDER AUTHORITY HE

03:00:03.359 --> 03:00:03.993
MADE THAT CLEAR.

03:00:04.059 --> 03:00:06.128
BUT IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU

03:00:06.195 --> 03:00:07.296
BELIEVE WOULD.

03:00:07.363 --> 03:00:15.571
HELP EFFECTUATE A GREATER.

03:00:15.638 --> 03:00:17.339
APART GREATER INTEGRITY PERHAPS

03:00:17.406 --> 03:00:19.141
GREATER COMPLIANCE WITH CODES OF

03:00:19.208 --> 03:00:20.609
THE JUDICIAL CODE OF ETHICS.

03:00:20.676 --> 03:00:21.310
IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN DO THIS --

03:00:21.377 --> 03:00:23.312
AT THE FRONT END RATHER THAN AT

03:00:23.379 --> 03:00:25.281
THE BACK END.

03:00:25.347 --> 03:00:26.182
SO THE THE AND THE ANSWER TO

03:00:26.248 --> 03:00:28.918
YOUR QUESTION IS YES IN TERMS OF

03:00:28.984 --> 03:00:30.152
PUTTING ON EDUCATION.

03:00:30.219 --> 03:00:31.987
LIKE THAT IS OUTSIDE OF OUR

03:00:32.054 --> 03:00:33.389
PURVIEW ANDERSON IN AS I

03:00:33.455 --> 03:00:34.623
MENTIONED WE DON'T HAVE

03:00:34.690 --> 03:00:36.158
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO

03:00:36.225 --> 03:00:39.128
ORDER IT -- AND TO ORDER ORDER

03:00:39.195 --> 03:00:39.895
CORRECTIVE ACTION.

03:00:39.962 --> 03:00:42.264
DO NOT CONSTITUTE A DISCIPLINE

03:00:42.331 --> 03:00:44.400
BUT CERTAINLY WERE HAPPY TO

03:00:44.466 --> 03:00:46.168
PARTICIPATE WITH THE JUDICIAL

03:00:46.235 --> 03:00:49.171
COUNCIL AND YOU KNOW OTHER UP.

03:00:49.238 --> 03:00:50.806
OTHER APPROPRIATE ENTITIES IN IN

03:00:50.873 --> 03:00:53.042
IN FIGURING OUT -- EDUCATION

03:00:53.108 --> 03:00:55.377
THAT WILL BE -- EFFECTIVE IN

03:00:55.444 --> 03:00:57.346
TRAINING JUDGES ESPECIALLY WERE

03:00:57.413 --> 03:00:59.515
ETHICAL CONCERNS ARE INVOLVED

03:00:59.582 --> 03:01:01.550
THANK.

03:01:01.617 --> 03:01:02.551
THANK YOU.

03:01:02.618 --> 03:01:03.619
PLEASE MR TERRACE BUT IT TO

03:01:03.686 --> 03:01:04.720
CORRECT A COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU

03:01:04.787 --> 03:01:05.321
HAD A QUESTION I DIDN'T GET A

03:01:05.387 --> 03:01:06.488
CHANCE TO RESPOND SO I I DO

03:01:06.555 --> 03:01:07.656
APOLOGIZE I DID MISSPEAK

03:01:07.723 --> 03:01:09.225
MISSPEAK.

03:01:09.291 --> 03:01:11.227
IT WASN'T THE REFERENCE TO THE

03:01:11.293 --> 03:01:14.230
DISCIPLINARY RECOMMENDATIONS --

03:01:14.296 --> 03:01:14.930
AS FROM THE SPECIAL MASTER

03:01:14.997 --> 03:01:16.098
SAMPLING BUT IT WAS THE

03:01:16.165 --> 03:01:18.467
DIFFERENCE TO THE COMMITTEE THE

03:01:18.534 --> 03:01:19.868
SPECIAL MASTERS FINDINGS.

03:01:19.935 --> 03:01:22.071
AND FACTUAL FINDINGS THAT THE

03:01:22.137 --> 03:01:24.240
COMMISSION IS HESITANT TO CHANGE

03:01:24.306 --> 03:01:26.242
THOSE FINDINGS AND AN AYE AYE I

03:01:26.308 --> 03:01:28.043
DO WANT TO REITERATE THAT I AM

03:01:28.110 --> 03:01:28.677
SURE.

03:01:28.744 --> 03:01:30.746
THE VAST MAJORITY IF NOT ALL OF

03:01:30.813 --> 03:01:32.648
THE SPECIAL MASTERS ARE VERY

03:01:32.715 --> 03:01:34.583
WELL TRAINED AND ARE ACTING VERY

03:01:34.650 --> 03:01:36.118
ETHICALLY I THINK THE PROBLEM

03:01:36.185 --> 03:01:37.686
WITH THIS IS REALLY THE PUBLIC

03:01:37.753 --> 03:01:38.821
PERCEPTION.

03:01:38.887 --> 03:01:40.923
AS ABSOLUTE JACKSON MENTIONED IN

03:01:40.990 --> 03:01:43.392
THAT WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT

03:01:43.459 --> 03:01:44.393
AND WHETHER THEY HAVE THAT THEY

03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:45.995
HAVE TAKEN AN OATH TO UPHOLD THE

03:01:46.061 --> 03:01:47.029
CONSTITUTION OR NOT.

03:01:47.096 --> 03:01:48.631
FROM THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION

03:01:48.697 --> 03:01:50.165
THAT IS WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

03:01:50.232 --> 03:01:53.068
AND SO FROM A PROCESS STANDPOINT

03:01:53.135 --> 03:01:54.203
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE

03:01:54.270 --> 03:01:55.137
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE MOD.

03:01:55.204 --> 03:02:00.109
THING LIKE THAT WHICH IS THE WAY

03:02:00.175 --> 03:02:01.443
THE OTHER AGENCIES -- HANDLE

03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:02.111
THESE TYPES OF HEARINGS WITH THE

03:02:02.177 --> 03:02:02.745
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS

03:02:02.811 --> 03:02:03.379
OF LAW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO

03:02:03.445 --> 03:02:04.280
HANDLE IT AND I DO RECOMMEND

03:02:04.346 --> 03:02:05.948
THAT YOU A LOOK AT THOSE OTHER

03:02:06.015 --> 03:02:06.915
MODELS.

03:02:06.982 --> 03:02:08.183
AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE

03:02:08.250 --> 03:02:10.953
PUBLIC HEARING I WASN'T --

03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:12.621
IMPLYING THAT THOSE -- HEARINGS

03:02:12.688 --> 03:02:14.089
DO NOT HAPPEN IN PUBLIC WHAT I

03:02:14.156 --> 03:02:15.724
WAS REFERRING TO IF THE PUBLIC'S

03:02:15.791 --> 03:02:17.726
IMPACT ON GET ON THE RULES THAT

03:02:17.793 --> 03:02:19.595
THE COMMISSION HAS AND AND MORE

03:02:19.662 --> 03:02:21.497
OF AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WAY

03:02:21.563 --> 03:02:22.398
WITH RESPECT TO CHANGE IN THOSE

03:02:22.464 --> 03:02:23.832
ROLES.

03:02:23.899 --> 03:02:24.733
THANK YOU FOR THE LET ME JUST

03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:26.502
ASK YOU GUYS YOUR THOUGHTS

03:02:26.568 --> 03:02:27.169
BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT

03:02:27.236 --> 03:02:31.407
THE UNICAMERAL BICAMERAL --

03:02:31.473 --> 03:02:33.842
OPTIONS HERE.

03:02:33.909 --> 03:02:35.444
SO JUST BE THOUGHTS ON THAT.

03:02:35.511 --> 03:02:37.379
HI AGAIN I JUST WOULD RECOMMEND

03:02:37.446 --> 03:02:38.380
THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AND AS

03:02:38.447 --> 03:02:39.281
WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR LETTER

03:02:39.348 --> 03:02:40.783
THE WAY THAT THE OTHER AGENCIES

03:02:40.849 --> 03:02:42.384
WORK AND THAT THEY SHOULD

03:02:42.451 --> 03:02:43.252
SEPARATE.

03:02:43.319 --> 03:02:44.787
AND THE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD BE

03:02:44.853 --> 03:02:46.955
HAPPENING AND ON ONE SIDE AND

03:02:47.022 --> 03:02:48.490
THAT SHOULD BE VERY SEPARATE

03:02:48.557 --> 03:02:49.425
FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH.

03:02:49.491 --> 03:02:52.161
THE DECISION MAKER IS I THINK IS

03:02:52.227 --> 03:02:54.830
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THAT.

03:02:54.897 --> 03:02:55.898
THANK YOU I VOTERS HAVE HAD THE

03:02:55.964 --> 03:02:57.232
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS

03:02:57.299 --> 03:03:00.602
AND IS DEEPLY ANALYZED -- OVER

03:03:00.669 --> 03:03:02.071
THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

03:03:02.137 --> 03:03:03.706
THERE HAVE BEEN CONSTITUTIONAL

03:03:03.772 --> 03:03:05.441
MEMBERS PRESENTED TO THE VOTERS.

03:03:05.507 --> 03:03:08.644
AND I THINK THIS IS -- A HEALTHY

03:03:08.711 --> 03:03:10.379
OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE THAT'S THE

03:03:10.446 --> 03:03:11.413
WORD.

03:03:11.480 --> 03:03:12.047
THE STATE AUDITOR USED

03:03:12.114 --> 03:03:14.016
OPPORTUNITY HERE TO EXAMINE AND

03:03:14.083 --> 03:03:15.984
LOOK AT HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN

03:03:16.051 --> 03:03:20.422
RUNNING IN IN WHAT -- INPUT CAN

03:03:20.489 --> 03:03:22.591
BE AVAILABLE TO MAKE SOME

03:03:22.658 --> 03:03:24.393
ADJUSTMENTS -- FOR THE FUTURE

03:03:24.460 --> 03:03:29.998
HOWEVER -- TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A A

03:03:30.065 --> 03:03:34.303
A A MAJOR -- STRUCTURAL A CHANGE

03:03:34.370 --> 03:03:36.472
I THINK REALLY REQUIRES -- MORE

03:03:36.538 --> 03:03:38.874
THOUGHTFULNESS MORE DELIBERATION

03:03:38.941 --> 03:03:40.042
MORE INPUT.

03:03:40.109 --> 03:03:42.644
RATHER THAN SIMPLY RELYING ON

03:03:42.711 --> 03:03:44.012
THE ATTORNEYS MODEL AS

03:03:44.079 --> 03:03:45.581
IMPLEMENTED BY THE AMERICAN BAR

03:03:45.647 --> 03:03:47.616
ASSOCIATION.

03:03:47.683 --> 03:03:48.884
AND THEIR RECOMMENDATION GRANT.

03:03:48.951 --> 03:03:50.986
IT'S A VERY -- THOUGHTFUL AND

03:03:51.053 --> 03:03:57.626
AND AND SALAS -- PLAN HOWEVER

03:03:57.693 --> 03:03:58.927
CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE AND I THINK

03:03:58.994 --> 03:04:00.629
WE SHOULD NOT BE FOLLOWING.

03:04:00.696 --> 03:04:02.664
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE BASED

03:04:02.731 --> 03:04:05.100
ON OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE

03:04:05.167 --> 03:04:08.103
NOT LIKE THE JURISDICTION OF

03:04:08.170 --> 03:04:09.705
CALIFORNIA SO LIKE THAT WOULD BE

03:04:09.772 --> 03:04:13.041
MY SUGGESTION IS TO JUST PROCEED

03:04:13.108 --> 03:04:15.711
SLOWLY WITH THIS AND AND REALLY --

03:04:15.778 --> 03:04:18.280
THE DELIBERATIVE THROUGH YOUR

03:04:18.347 --> 03:04:21.116
PROCESS.

03:04:21.183 --> 03:04:22.584
OKAY THANK YOU LET ME ASK OF ANY

NEARLY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS.

03:05:16.438 --> 03:05:17.506
IN EMBEZZLED SECURITY.

03:05:17.573 --> 03:05:19.341
BECAUSE THESE JUDGES HAVE NOT

03:05:19.408 --> 03:05:21.310

03:05:21.376 --> 03:05:22.911
OVERTURNING.

03:05:30.953 --> 03:05:31.920
TWENTY EIGHT EVIDENCE OF A VALID

FICTITIOUS BUSINESS LICENSE

03:05:33.188 --> 03:05:34.490
WHICH IS A MISDEMEANOR FOR ANY

03:05:34.556 --> 03:05:37.626
ATTORNEY TO PRACTICE WITHOUT A

03:05:37.693 --> 03:05:39.628

03:05:41.129 --> 03:05:41.597
IS THAT THE REAL PARTY IN

INTRASTATE.

03:05:51.707 --> 03:05:52.708
AND THE LACK OF A CREDIBLE

03:05:52.774 --> 03:05:54.142
WITNESS BECAUSE WE HAVE SUMMARY

03:05:54.209 --> 03:05:56.478
PROCEEDINGS WERE ATTORNEYS ARE

03:05:56.545 --> 03:05:58.480
ALLOWED TO TESTIFY. TO REMOVE

03:05:58.547 --> 03:06:00.749
HOMEOWNERS IN SUMMARY

03:06:00.816 --> 03:06:02.651
PROCEEDINGS WHICH ARE ILLEGAL.

03:06:02.718 --> 03:06:04.486
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TRY TITLE

03:06:04.553 --> 03:06:06.154
AT A STATE SUPERIOR COURT.

03:06:06.221 --> 03:06:07.289
THESE ARE ALL DEBT COLLECTION

03:06:07.356 --> 03:06:08.490

JUDICIARY COURTS AND THEY ARE

03:06:13.529 --> 03:06:15.130
NOT.

03:06:15.197 --> 03:06:16.398
SO EVERYONE OF THE JUDGES WERE

03:06:16.465 --> 03:06:17.699
FORMER ATTORNEYS SHOULD HAVE

03:06:17.766 --> 03:06:19.401
TAKEN THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

03:06:19.468 --> 03:06:21.303
ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A SECURITY

03:06:21.370 --> 03:06:22.504
AGREEMENT THERE WAS A

03:06:22.571 --> 03:06:24.206
CONSIGNMENT AGREEMENT AND THERE

LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND

03:08:58.994 --> 03:09:00.429

WITHOUT DISCIPLINE.

03:09:51.246 --> 03:09:52.914

CASES THAT WE HAVE WHERE THESE

03:12:55.830 --> 03:12:57.132

03:12:57.198 --> 03:12:59.000
A JUDGE WITH LOTION BLOW BLOOD

03:12:59.067 --> 03:13:00.201

03:13:00.268 --> 03:13:03.305

THAT THE APPELLATE PROCESS DOES

03:14:10.338 --> 03:14:12.073

UP WITH THE APPELLATE COURTS

03:14:17.345 --> 03:14:18.913
EVERY ATTORNEY KNOWS THAT THE

03:14:18.980 --> 03:14:20.482
COURT OF APPEAL DOES NOT

03:14:20.548 --> 03:14:22.784

I I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT.

03:15:59.447 --> 03:16:00.715
MOST OF THESE CASES WERE

03:16:00.782 --> 03:16:03.585
DISMISSED BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT

03:16:03.651 --> 03:16:05.253
JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT I WOULD LIKE

03:16:05.320 --> 03:16:06.988

CUSTODY OF THEM.

03:16:26.141 --> 03:16:27.709
THIS WAS ALL DONE BASED ON A

03:16:27.775 --> 03:16:30.044
PRESUMPTION THAT IS RIGHT MY

03:16:30.111 --> 03:16:31.613
CHILDREN WERE TAKEN FROM ME.

03:16:31.679 --> 03:16:33.648
BASED ON A PRESUMPTION NOT ON

03:16:33.715 --> 03:16:37.752
FACTS IN EVIDENCE NOT ON A TRIAL.

03:16:37.819 --> 03:16:39.154
THE LAWMAKERS SHOULD CREATED

03:16:39.220 --> 03:16:41.322
THIS LOCK CODE PRESUMED THAT THE

03:16:41.389 --> 03:16:43.658
JUDGES WOULD BE ETHICAL ENOUGH

03:16:43.725 --> 03:16:45.927
TO GIVE ME A HEARING. TO REBUT

03:16:45.994 --> 03:16:47.795
THIS PRESUMPTION.

03:16:47.862 --> 03:16:49.964
MY JUDGE DENIED ME A REBUTTAL A

03:16:50.031 --> 03:16:52.667
HEARING FOR THREE AND A HALF

03:16:52.734 --> 03:16:53.535
YEARS.

03:16:53.601 --> 03:16:55.270
SO THE LAWMAKERS ARE NOT IN LINE.

03:16:55.336 --> 03:16:56.604
GOING ON IN THE COURTROOM YOU

03:16:56.671 --> 03:16:58.072
ARE ASSUMING YOU ARE WORKING

03:16:58.139 --> 03:16:59.807
WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE BY US

03:16:59.874 --> 03:17:01.176

03:17:02.810 --> 03:17:03.945
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU.

03:17:04.012 --> 03:17:06.314
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING IN OUR

03:17:06.381 --> 03:17:07.415
FAMILY COURTS.

03:17:07.482 --> 03:17:08.483
CALIFORNIA HAS A STRICT

03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:10.785
DIRECTIVE VISITATION WITH THE

03:17:10.852 --> 03:17:12.720
PARENT CANNOT BE DENIED UNLESS

03:17:12.787 --> 03:17:14.355
THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT

03:17:14.422 --> 03:17:15.657
THIS IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST

03:17:15.723 --> 03:17:16.791
OF THE CHILD.

03:17:16.858 --> 03:17:18.459
I WILL TELL YOU.

03:17:18.526 --> 03:17:19.894
I KNOW HUNDREDS OF PARENTS

03:17:19.961 --> 03:17:21.229
PERSONALLY WHO ARE DENIED

03:17:21.296 --> 03:17:24.098
VISITATION BASED ON NOTHING MORE

03:17:24.165 --> 03:17:25.633
THAN A JUDGE'S PERSONAL OPINION.

03:17:25.700 --> 03:17:27.902
THIS IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF DUE

03:17:27.969 --> 03:17:29.837
PROCESS HOW DO YOU PUT THAT INTO

03:17:29.904 --> 03:17:31.940
A COMPLAINT HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT

03:17:32.006 --> 03:17:33.474
COMPLAINT RELEVANT.

03:17:33.541 --> 03:17:34.676
APPARENTLY WERE NOT USING THE

03:17:34.742 --> 03:17:36.945
RIGHT SEMANTICS BUT IF YOU THINK

03:17:37.011 --> 03:17:38.213
TAKING SOMEONE'S CHILD AND

03:17:38.279 --> 03:17:40.615
DENYING VISITATION IS LEGAL IN

03:17:40.682 --> 03:17:42.483
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:44.385
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

03:17:44.452 --> 03:17:45.620
THE US SUPREME COURT HAS

03:17:45.687 --> 03:17:46.688
DETERMINED THAT A PARENT COULD

03:17:46.754 --> 03:17:48.089
NOT BE STRIPPED OF LEGAL RIGHTS

03:17:48.156 --> 03:17:49.791
TO THEIR CHILDREN WITHOUT A

03:17:49.857 --> 03:17:51.659
STRICT SCRUTINY HEARING.

03:17:51.726 --> 03:17:54.696
WHEN I TOLD MY JUDGE I WANTED A

03:17:54.762 --> 03:17:56.464
STRICT SCRUTINY HEARING SHE

03:17:56.531 --> 03:17:58.600
LEANED INTO THE MICROPHONE AND

03:17:58.666 --> 03:18:00.201
SAID MISS SO DORY STRICT

03:18:00.268 --> 03:18:02.270
SCRUTINY DOES NOT APPLY IN MY

03:18:02.337 --> 03:18:04.005
COURTROOM?

03:18:04.072 --> 03:18:07.942
NOW THIS IS A COURT ROOM STILL

03:18:08.009 --> 03:18:08.776
ON WILL.

03:18:08.843 --> 03:18:10.111
ON LAND IN THE UNITED.

03:18:10.178 --> 03:18:12.313
ERICA SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:14.182
CONCEPT EXCEPT THAT I'M DEALING

03:18:14.249 --> 03:18:15.516
WITH THE QUARTERBACK FORTY

03:18:15.583 --> 03:18:17.118
INSTEAD OF A COURT OF LAW WHICH

03:18:17.185 --> 03:18:18.486
MEANS THAT ALL OF THE DECISIONS

03:18:18.553 --> 03:18:20.255
ARE BASED ON HEARSAY RATHER THAN

03:18:20.321 --> 03:18:22.657
FACTS OR EVIDENCE.

03:18:22.724 --> 03:18:23.891
WHEN THIS PANEL SITS HERE IN

03:18:23.958 --> 03:18:26.861
SAYS NEITHER PARTY IS HAPPY IN

03:18:26.928 --> 03:18:28.596
COURT OUTCOMES AND LITIGANTS ARE

03:18:28.663 --> 03:18:31.065
SIMPLY LOOKING TO BLAME A JUDGE?

03:18:31.132 --> 03:18:32.267
IT SHOWS YOU THEIR LACK OF

03:18:32.333 --> 03:18:34.302
EDUCATION OR WILL FOR WILLFUL

03:18:34.369 --> 03:18:36.070
IGNORANCE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING

03:18:36.137 --> 03:18:38.806
IN OUR FAMILY AND JUDICIAL COURT.

03:18:38.873 --> 03:18:40.375
WHAT WE ARE PRESENTING TO YOU IN

03:18:40.441 --> 03:18:41.776
TRYING TO TELL YOU IS THAT THE

03:18:41.843 --> 03:18:43.311
MINUTE YOU WALK INTO FAMILY

03:18:43.378 --> 03:18:44.012
COURT?

03:18:44.078 --> 03:18:46.347
OR JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURT

03:18:46.414 --> 03:18:47.649
THERE'S A COMPLETE DISREGARD OF

03:18:47.715 --> 03:18:49.150
DUE PROCESS.

03:18:49.217 --> 03:18:51.019
THERE'S A BLATANT DISREGARD FOR

03:18:51.085 --> 03:18:53.321
THE LIBERTY INTEREST PROTECTED

03:18:53.388 --> 03:18:54.822
BY THE US CONSTITUTION.

03:18:54.889 --> 03:18:56.357
AND I WILL ARGUE THERE'S A

03:18:56.424 --> 03:18:58.059
WILLFUL AND INTENTIONAL

03:18:58.126 --> 03:18:59.794
DESTRUCTION OF FAMILIES FOR

03:18:59.861 --> 03:19:01.162
PROFIT.

03:19:01.229 --> 03:19:02.897
THIS IS NOW A FIFTY TWO BILLION

03:19:02.964 --> 03:19:04.666
DOLLAR INDUSTRY. TO THINK THAT

03:19:04.732 --> 03:19:07.101
JUDGES ARE NOT GOING TO SUCCUMB

03:53:19.719 --> 03:53:21.020

TEMPORARY JUDGE.

03:53:27.059 --> 03:53:28.194
AND I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS OF

03:53:28.260 --> 03:53:29.528
THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL

03:53:29.595 --> 03:53:30.896

SENATOR ALLEN'S POINT IS.

03:53:46.212 --> 03:53:48.581

03:53:50.015 --> 03:53:51.317
IF YOU WANT TO BE A TEMPORARY

03:53:51.384 --> 03:53:54.153

03:54:10.736 --> 03:54:12.538

IT SAID THEY WERE BEING

04:13:40.939 --> 04:13:42.674
UNCOOPERATIVE.

04:13:42.740 --> 04:13:44.208
AND I DON'T BELIEVE SUING THE

04:13:44.275 --> 04:13:46.311
AUDITOR BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING

04:13:46.377 --> 04:13:47.879
THAT THE CLIP COMPLAINTS ARE

04:13:47.946 --> 04:13:51.015
VALID -- CONFIDENTIAL.

04:13:51.082 --> 04:13:53.585
IS BEING COOPERATIVE I AM TODAY

04:13:53.651 --> 04:13:54.619
THEY SAID THEY WERE BEING

04:13:54.686 --> 04:13:56.487
COOPERATIVE AFTER.

04:13:56.554 --> 04:13:59.223
THERE ARE AFTER THEIR LAWSUIT.

04:13:59.290 --> 04:14:00.592
WAS SETTLED.

04:14:00.658 --> 04:14:03.761
SO I THINK WHAT I'M SEEING IS

04:14:03.828 --> 04:14:05.663
IT'S TAKING TIME TO DIGEST.

04:14:05.730 --> 04:14:06.931
WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN THIS AUDIT

04:14:06.998 --> 04:14:11.035
AND THERE HAS BEEN NO OVERSIGHT?

04:14:11.102 --> 04:14:13.605
REALLY FAR JUDGES.

04:14:13.671 --> 04:14:15.406
I HEARD TODAY -- SENATOR HANNAH

04:14:15.473 --> 04:14:17.709
BETH JACKSON SAID THAT SHE WAS

04:14:17.775 --> 04:14:19.577
OF THAT SHE IS CONCERNED THAT

04:14:19.644 --> 04:14:21.045
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO SERVE

04:14:21.112 --> 04:14:24.515
JUSTICE.

04:14:24.582 --> 04:14:26.784
AND HER COMMENT REALLY WAS.

04:14:26.851 --> 04:14:27.752
AT THIS WAS DUE TO WHAT THE

04:14:27.819 --> 04:14:29.854
OVERSIGHT WOULD DO ANYTHING THAT

04:14:29.921 --> 04:14:30.955
HAPPENS WITH TO SEE JP.

04:14:31.022 --> 04:14:33.658
MY TAKE ON IT IS THAT WE HAVE

04:14:33.725 --> 04:14:35.526
JUDGES WHO ARE NOT DOING.

04:14:35.593 --> 04:14:38.396
WHAT IS RIGHT -- BECAUSE WE HAVE

04:14:38.463 --> 04:14:41.065
A CULTURE THAT DISMISSES ABUSE.

04:14:41.132 --> 04:14:42.333
AND IF THEY TRY TO DO WHAT'S

04:14:42.400 --> 04:14:44.035
RIGHT.

04:14:44.102 --> 04:14:45.103
THEY WILL NO LONGER HAVE THEIR

04:14:45.169 --> 04:14:48.573
JOBS.

04:14:48.640 --> 04:14:50.808
I'M WE HAVE HAD A COMPLAINT --

04:14:50.875 --> 04:14:52.610
SOMEONE IN LOS ANGELES CALL

04:14:52.677 --> 04:14:54.746
TODAY THEY HAD FILED A COMPLAINT

04:14:54.812 --> 04:14:56.247
WITH THE CJ BE A YEAR AGO.

04:14:56.314 --> 04:14:59.584
AND THAT COMPLAINT WAS.

04:14:59.651 --> 04:15:01.653
ENTERED INTO INVESTIGATION FACE

04:15:01.719 --> 04:15:03.287
SO IT COMPLIED WITH WHAT WAS

04:15:03.354 --> 04:15:04.489
NEEDED.

04:15:04.555 --> 04:15:06.391
AND THAT'S GREAT ON JUST AFTER

04:15:06.457 --> 04:15:08.693
THE AUDIT THAT WAS DISMISSED

04:15:08.760 --> 04:15:10.161
EVEN THAT WAS A VALID COMPLAINT.

04:15:10.228 --> 04:15:11.763
WE ARE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

04:15:11.829 --> 04:15:13.665
VALID COMPLAINTS ACTUALLY MAKE

04:15:13.731 --> 04:15:15.533
THEM ALL THE WAY THROUGH --

04:15:15.600 --> 04:15:17.235
REGARDLESS OF THIS -- YOU KNOW

04:15:17.301 --> 04:15:20.171
IT'S 50% LESS LIKELY THAT.

04:15:20.238 --> 04:15:22.273
PUBLIC WILL BE HEARD BY THE SEA

04:15:22.340 --> 04:15:25.343
JP.

04:15:25.410 --> 04:15:25.843
WHEN YOU SEE THAT I GET

04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:29.013
EVERYTHING I JUST -- I ALSO

04:15:29.080 --> 04:15:30.214
HEARD A LOT OF COMMENTS TODAY

04:15:30.281 --> 04:15:32.450

MARRIED ABUSERS -- MURDERED

04:15:41.125 --> 04:15:42.660
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING

04:15:42.727 --> 04:15:45.430
THE PROTECTION AND THOSE JUDGES.

04:15:45.496 --> 04:15:47.031

WITH BOUNDARIES AND ONE JUDGES

04:15:56.374 --> 04:15:57.975

04:15:58.042 --> 04:16:00.545
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET -- IT'S

04:16:00.611 --> 04:16:01.846
