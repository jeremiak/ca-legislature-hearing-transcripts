OR OPENINGS THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN JUST OF THE FEW QUICK COMMENTS. A NUMBER ONE I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN I CAME THE LEGISLATURE. CYBER SECURITY I THINK THAT WAS- THAT THAT MEANT THAT THE STAR WARS POLICE FORCE THAT'S WHAT THEY REFERRED TO I THINK IS CYBER SECURITY. AND TODAY IS ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH WE ARE VULNERABLE. AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT- WITH RESPECT TO CYBERSECURITY BOTH FROM A NATION STATE BAD FOLKS AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL BAD FOLKS SO I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HIGHLIGHTING THIS ISSUE AND BRINGING FORTH SOME EXCELLENT PANELISTS. SO THAT WE CAN GATHER INFORMATION PERHAPS TO IMPROVE OUR PUBLIC POLICY THANK YOU CENTERMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER ON BURKE AND I WANNA THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CYBER SECURITY IDENTITY THEFT FROM MENTIONS- FIRST INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THIS SELECT COMMITTEE WHICH WE FORMED EARLIER THIS YEAR WILL STUDY AND MAKE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THREATS. PREPAREDNESS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATED WITH CYBER SECURITY. AS WELL AS DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS FROM THE DANGERS OF IDENTITY THEFT. THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S INTRODUCTORY HEARING IS THE GROWING THREAT OF DATA BREACHES. LAST DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY A CYBER SECURITY ATTACK ON EXCEL IN. AN AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY COMPANY HIT OUR OWN UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND ITS COMMUNITY IMPACTING FACULTY STUDENTS CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. RETIRES AND MANY OTHERS. THIS ATTACK HAS RESULTED IN COUNTLESS REPORTS OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION ENDING UP ON THE DARK WEB. LEAVING THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING ME AND MY OWN FAMILY VULNERABLE TO IDENTITY THEFT. FRAUD AND OTHER DANGERS. I SHOULD SAY THAT EARLY THIS YEAR EARLIER THIS YEAR IN JANUARY- I FIRST RECEIVE NOTICE THAT MY WIFE MYSELF AND OUR THREE YOUNG CHILDREN. I HAD HAD OUR DATA LEAKS BECAUSE OF THIS BREACH- AND THAT WAS THE PROXIMATE REASON THAT I DECIDED TO FORM THE CYBER SECURITY. COMMITTEE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS EVENT IS NOT ISOLATED BUT JUST ONE IN A LARGE STRING OF CONCERNING CYBERSECURITY TACT IN. RECENT YEARS. FIVE SIX MONTHS AFTER THAT YOU SEE NOTICE I SHOULD SAY FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE I LEARNED. THAT I WAS. MY DATA WAS BREACHED AGAIN BECAUSE I'M A CUSTOMER T. MOBILE WHICH WAS SUBJECTED TO A- LARGE AND CONCERNING CYBER SECURITY HACK- AS OUR WORLD HAS GROWN MORE DIGITALLY CONNECTED WE'VE NOT KEPT UP. WITH IMPLEMENTING SAFEGUARDS AGAINST MISUSE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE WE'VE SEEN SO MANY ENTITIES FALL VICTIM TO THESE ATTACKS AND THESE ARE THE ONLY% ONLY THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY REPORTED. IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR A CYBER ATTACK WAS MADE AGAINST THE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM IN FLORIDA. THE ATTACKER ATTEMPTED TO POISON THE WATER SUPPLY AND MANAGE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SODIUM HYDROXIDE TO POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LEVELS. THAT'S ONE MONTH LATER ONE OF THE BIGGEST CYBER INSURANCE FIRMS UNITED STATES CNA FINANCIAL. SUFFERED A RANSOMWARE ATTACK INTERRUPTING KANNST CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE SERVICES FOR THREE DAYS. ALSO AROUND THIS TIME A MASS CYBERATTACK AFFECTED MILLIONS OF MICROSOFT CLIENTS AROUND THE GLOBE. WHEN INDIVIDUALS ATTACKED THE MICROSOFT EXCHANGE SERVER. NEW SOURCES ESTIMATED THAT NINE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OVER SIXTY THOUSAND PRIVATE COMPANIES AND UNITED STATES WERE AFFECTED IN THIS ATTACK. WHILE THESE ATTACKS COST REAL CONCERN AND ECONOMIC DAMAGE TO INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES THEY ALSO COME AT GREAT COST OUR BROADER ECONOMY. IN TWENTY TWENTY CYBERATTACKS COST THE GLOBAL ECONOMY APPROXIMATELY ONE TRILLION DOLLARS REPRESENTING MORE THAN 1% OF GLOBAL GDP. THE AVERAGE COST OF DATA BREACH IS AVERAGE IN TWENTY TWENTY WAS THREE POINT EIGHT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT AVERAGE COST OF A DATA BREACH ROSE TO FOUR POINT TWO FOUR MILLION. WE HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY AND UTILIZE EXPERTISE FROM THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPHERE TO BUILD ROBUST SOLUTIONS. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY MY STRONG BELIEF AND I THINK I'M JOINED IN THIS BELIEF BY MY COLLEAGUES. IS THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PLAY HERE IN SUPPORTING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN PROTECTING OUR OWN PUBLIC SECTOR VULNERABILITIES. AND THAT IS ONE REASON WE ARE HEARING FROM THIS PANEL OF EXPERTS SO TODAY WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM TWO PANELS OF EXPERT WITNESSES. PANEL ONE WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF DATA BREACHES RESPONSE EFFORTS AND PREVENTION MEASURES. PENALTY WILL DIVE INTO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT EFFORTS IN CYBER SECURITY. AND THEN AFTER TWO PANELS WE OPEN UP WE WILL OPEN UP THE DISCUSSION OF PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE WE ADJOURN THIS HEARING. OUR GOAL FOR TODAY IS TO DIVE INTO LOCAL AND STATE EFFORTS TO PREVENT CYBERATTACKS AND DISCUSS HOW WE CAN EXPAND UPON THOSE EFFORTS TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR ROBUST SOLUTIONS. AND SENATOR UMBERG YOU'LL YOU'LL GIVE YOUR OPENING RESPITE CENTRE BORJAS HAS JOINED US INSIDE LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE IF YOU MIGHT. HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS. JUST SIMPLY TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION FOR YOU SPEARHEADING THE CREATION OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE- I THINK YOU HAVE- ADDED INFORMATION- BASED ON YOUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I TO. REPRESENT CONSTITUENTS ARE WHO HAVE BEEN HACKED AND- YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH THE RANSOMWARE PROCESS AND- IT'S A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. AND ONE THAT- ON FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES. ARE HAVING A DEVIL OF A TIME. TRYING TO ASCERTAIN THE WHEREABOUTS IN ORIGINATION OF THOSE ACTORS. SOME OF WHOM MAY BE STATE ACTORS SO THIS IS A VERY TIMELY TOPIC THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS IN THE FREE LEADERSHIP. BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH OUR SPEAKERS I WANT TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WHO MIGHT WANT TO PARTICIPATE TO GO AHEAD AND CALL IN NOW YOU CAN DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER EIGHT FOUR FOUR. TWO NINE ONE FIVE FOUR NINE ZERO. EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE FIVE FOUR NINE ZERO AND WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE ACCESS CODE SEVEN ONE SIX TWO THREE FIVE THREE. BUT LET'S OPEN UP OUR FIRST PANEL AND WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER BRUCE R. BIRD EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL OF PALO ALTO NETWORKS. WHICH IS ONE OF THE LEAGUE'S LEADING CYBERSECURITY PREVENTION COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE WORLD. MR BIRD IF YOU COULD PLEASE BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN FOR- GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE ALSO NETWORKS. I'M GOING TO DO THREE THINGS IN MIND SHORTER ALL THE REMARKS. FIRST I GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT OUR COMPANY. SECOND I'LL GO OVER SOME OF THE- KIA MERGING CYBERSECURITY THREATS THAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW. AND THIRD I'LL GIVE YOU SOME CONSIDERATION POLICYMAKER CONSIDERATIONS. ARE THE BEST WAYS. TO COMBAT CYBER SECURITY THREATS. SO LET ME START BY TELLING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR COMPANY- BALANCE IN IT WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY WE HAVE OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE THIRTY SIX HUNDRED OF THEM ARE BASED HERE IN CALIFORNIA- WE PROVIDE. SECURITY TO THE MOST SENSITIVE GOVERNMENT NETWORKS. THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED AND MANY OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS. MORE LOCALLY WE PROVIDE SECURITY THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND WE SUPPORT THIRTY NINE CYBER ACADEMY PROGRAMS AND THE GIRL SCOUTS OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT I THINK IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT BASIC BIO IS A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY ON OUR EVOLUTION AS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY BECAUSE I THINK IT MIRRORS. THE THREATS THAT WE'RE SEEING EMERGE OVER TIME IN THE CYBER SECURITY SPACE. YEARS AGO BEFORE HELLO TO NETWORKS ENTERED THE CYBER SECURITY SPACE. CYBER SECURITY WAS DELIVERED IN A SPECIFIC WAY. PRODUCTS WERE CREATED TO DEFEAT ROMERO CYBER IDENTIFIED CYBER SECURITY THREATS AND THAT WAS NO LONGER WORKING AS THE INTERNET BECAME- AND ACCESS TO. THE INTERNET AND THE USE OF THE INTERNET AS A TOOL OF COMMERCE COMMUNICATION. AND SOCIALIZATION GROUP AND SO THE FIRST PHASE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY EVOLUTION AT PALO ALTO NETWORKS WAS THAT WE DEVELOPED A BEST IN CLASS NEXT GENERATION FIREWALL A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT- THAT IS USED FOR NETWORK SECURITY BUSINESSES AND ENTERPRISES AND GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. WHAT MADE THAT DID WHAT MADE THAT DIFFERENCE. OR REVOLUTIONARY WITH A LEAF IS THAT IT ALLOWS FOR THE INTEGRATION OF SECURITY CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE NETWORK AS OPPOSED TO USING SPECIFIC PRODUCTS TO DEFEAT SPECIFIC CYBER THREATS SO THAT WAS EIGHT S. EACH CHANGE IN THE WAY CYBER SECURITY. WAS IT WAS WAS APPROACHED. THE NEXT PHASE. OF MATCHED HOW THREATS AND THE USE OF THE INTERNET EVOLVED. AS YOU KNOW MUCH OF- INTERNET FACING COMMERCE AND EVEN IN CONSUMER USE IS EMPOWERED BY CLOUD NETWORKS- THESE CALL NETWORKS ARE PROVIDED BY A VARIETY OF INSTITUTIONS BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE MOST NOTABLE AMAZON. WEB SERVICES GOOGLE CLOUD MICROSOFT AND THERE ARE OTHER CLOUDS THAT DISTRIBUTE- COMPUTING CAPABILITY. ANY EXTRAORDINARILY EFFICIENT MANNER. WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN WAS IF WE WERE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE THAT- COMPUTER CAPABILITY THAT TECHNOLOGY WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE COULD PROTECT DISTRIBUTED FLOW OF INFORMATION AT THE SAME TIME AND SO THE NEXT BIG PHASE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT OR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT WAS TO MATCH THE USE OF CLOUD- AS A TOOL FOR FAR- COMPUTING CAPABILITY AND TECHNOLOGY. SO NOW WE SHOULD. ARE UNIFIED WAY THE USE OF THE USED BY GOVERNMENT BY INDIVIDUALS AND BY COMPANIES. THE USE OF CLOUD NETWORKS. THE THIRD BIG M. O. EVOLUTION WHICH I THINK IS THE FRONTIER OF CYBER SECURITY AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALLY FOCUS ON THIS BECAUSE IT MATCHES UP. WITH THE EMERGING THREATS THAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE USE OF. MAPPING OKAY ALEX DESCRIBE THAT- AUTOMATED DETECTION AND SO THIS IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO HELP DETECT THREATS BEFORE THEY GET TO SOMEONE'S NETWORK AND AUTOMATION FOR YOUR SECURITY OPERATIONS THAT IS THE FRONTIER OF CYBER SECURITY AND THAT IS WHERE WE HAVEN'T WE'VE INVESTED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS JUST OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS TO BECOME BEST IN CLASS IN THAT FRONT HERE. AND SO THINK ABOUT MAPPING THIS WAY YOU YOU- YOU'VE CERTAINLY HEARD OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS THIS IS THE ATTACHMENT OF BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVICES TO BROADBAND NETWORKS EVERYTHING FROM- HEALTH DETECTOR THAT YOU MIGHT WEAR ON YOUR WRIST TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM ON A FREIGHTER SHIP OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. BECAUSE NOW BILLIONS OF. DEVICES HANG OFF THE INTERNET WE HAVE TO GET VERY SMART ABOUT THE WAY YOU DO TO PROTECT THEM BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THEM. PRESENTS ARE ACTUALLY IS THE POINT OF VULNERABILITY IN THE SYSTEM. SO WHAT WE BELIEVE STRONGLY IN IS YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR VULNERABILITIES ARE BEFORE YOU CAN PROTECT THAT AND SO WE ALONG WITH OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY. HAVE DEVELOPED MAPPING TECHNOLOGY TO HELP YOU FIND WHERE YOUR VULNERABILITIES ARE AND THEN DEPLOY DETECTION AND DEFEAT CAPABILITIES TO USE SMART AND DDOT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ANOTHER SMART TECHNOLOGIES TO DEFEAT THE VULNERABILITIES BEFORE THEY GET TO THOSE WILL BE CALL IN POINTS. THAT IS THE NEXT FRONTIER SO THAT IS THE EVOLUTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IN MATCHES THE EVOLUTION OF THE THREAT. SO LET ME BRIEFLY GO OVER STRESS WHAT ARE THE SOME OF THE BIGGEST THREATS AND EMERGING THREATS THAT WE'RE SEEING- ONE ALREADY ALLUDED TO RANSOMWARE. I THINK IT IS. THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE RANSOMWARE IS THAT IS THAT HE IS A SCOURGE USED TO ACTUALLY BE A BIT OF A HOBBY. WHERE THE AVERAGE RANSOM WAS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY CONTRAST THE AVERAGE RANSOM DEMAND ROSE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN PERCENT. TO FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THE AVERAGE RANSOM IS NOW OVER FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO IT IS IT IS NOT IT IS THIS IS WHY I CALLED A SEARCH. ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS OF THIS YEAR WAS THE COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK. THAT DISRUPTED OIL PRODUCTION- FOR A SYSTEM THAT PROVIDED NEARLY 45% OF THE FUEL PROVIDED THE WAY TO THE EAST COAST. A SECOND MAJOR EMERGING THREAT RELATES TO INDUSTRIAL CONTROL CONTROL SYSTEMS SO ABSOLUTE AS I ALLUDED TO A MOMENT AGO THESE ARE THE SYSTEMS PHYSICAL SYSTEMS LIKE PUMPS. THAT UNDER TO UNDERPIN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE A WATER SYSTEM OR ELECTRIC ELECTRIC SYSTEM. THESE INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE A NEW SIGNIFICANT EMERGING THREATS IN THE CYBER SECURITY SPACE A RECENT EXAMPLE- CENTER REFERRED. TO IT ALREADY IS THIS OLD SMART WATER TREATMENT FACILITY BREACH IN FLORIDA EARLIER THIS YEAR WHERE TAX GAIN ACCESS TO SYSTEMS THAT CONTROL THE MIXTURE OF SODIUM HYDROXIDE IN THEWATER SUPPLY. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT ONE HUNDRED TIMES HIGHER THAN NORMAL. ESSENTIALLY CREATING THE POSSIBILITY THIS ACTUALLY POISONING THE WATER. THAT'S BECAUSE THESE INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE ARE MANIFOLD AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH THEM YOU HAVE TO PROTECT ESPECIALLY ALL OF THEM. THE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS THESE ATTACKS THAT SEEK TO DAMAGE AN ORGANIZATION BY TARGETING THE LESS SECURE ELEMENTS IN ITS SUPPLY CHAIN SO. ENTERPRISE MIGHT AT BEST IN CLASS CYBER SECURITY CAPABILITY. WHAT IF ITS SUPPLY CHAIN HAS IDENTIFIABLE- BONNEVILLE RESENTED CYBER ATTACKERS ARE LIKELY TO FIND IT AND EXPLOIT THE MOST NOTABLE SUPPLY JACK'S SPY TRAINING TAX OF LATE WAS THE US SOLAR WINDS TACK SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT- THIS IS OUR ATTACKERS MOST LIKELY FROM RUSSIA RABAL TO COMPROMISE- WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SUMMER ROUTINE SOFTWARE UPDATE FROM A TRUSTED SOURCE. WELL SAID THIS OFFER WAS DOWNLOADED AND EXECUTED AS FOLLOWS THE NETWORKS. THAT DOWNLOADED THE SOFTWARE. AND FOURTH ALL WE THE CAN IMPORTANT THREAT THAT WE FACE IS SOMETHING WE CALL ON OUR ABILITY EXPLOITATION. THAT BASICALLY IS A FANCY WAY OF SAYING SOFTWARE CAN CHANGE WE CAN ASSESS SOME OF THOSE WEAKNESSES ARE KNOWN SOME OF THEM ARE NOT REAL. AND IT TANKERS SEEK THEM OUT. AND THEY REALLY WHAT THEY DO. IS THEY FIND VULNERABILITIES BECAUSE USERS OF THE SOFTWARE HAVE NOT DONE THIS SIMPLE THING OF PATCHING SOFTWARE PATCHES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUSHED OUT. SO WE CALL THESE UNMITIGATED VULNERABILITIES IN SOFTWARE AND THEY POSE A SERIOUS THREAT. TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE JUST THIS WEEK. ACTUALLY JUST ONE WEEK AGO I BELIEVE- THE GUARDIAN US GOVERNMENT THIS IS A THE- CYBER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY HOSTED A SET OF KNOWN VULNERABILITIES AND DIRECTED FEDERAL AGENCIES TO CLOSE THEM THROUGH AVAILABLE SOFTWARE PATCHES. ENTERPRISES HOWEVER ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND OFTEN DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT PROCESSES AND HYGIENE BREAK IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT VULNERABILITIES ARE CLOSED EVEN WHEN PATCHES ARE AVAILABLE. SO FINALLY JUST A FEW THOUGHTS ON WHAT POLICY MAKERS CAN DO OR WHAT THEY MIGHT CONSIDER- MIGHT CONSIDER AS WE FACE THESE EMERGING THREATS. FIRST OF ALL WE ENCOURAGE POLICYMAKERS TO INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF WHAT WE CALL A SECTORAL FRAMEWORKS. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY FOR INSTANCE HAS ADOPTED A WELL KNOWN CYBER SECURITY FRAMEWORK. THERE ARE SIMILAR FRAMEWORKS. THESE ARE GUIDEPOSTS EASIER THESE ARE PLAIN BOX IF YOU WILL FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY TO SECURITY. TO SECURE YOUR NETWORKS WHETHER YOU'RE IN A GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTION OR OTHER FORM OF ENTERPRISE. SECOND WE THINK THAT IN THE RANSOMWARE SPACE THERE SHOULD BE SMART FORMS OF REQUIRED INCIDENT REPORTING. TO OFTEN- IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT OR NOT THESE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS COMING GO. RANSOM IS PAID VULNERABILITIES ARE KNOWN BUT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH. COLLABORATIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE VICTIM. AND THEY TRULY ARE VICTIMS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ANOTHER GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS THIRD KNOWING THE THREATS GET INFORMED- MANY MOST MOST LARGE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS ALL HAVE A SECURITY TEAM THE LEADERS OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE TALKING THAT SECURITY TEAM. AND THE SECURITY TEAM SHOULD BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXPERTISE OUTSIDE OF THEIR ROUND. FOR INSTANCE JUST TODAY ARE KIND OF PALO ALTO NETWORKS ARE UNIT FORTY TWO- RESEARCH TEAM PUBLISHED A REPORT REGARDING VULNERABILITIES THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED INVOLVING DEFENSE CONTRACTORS. AND THREATS THEY WERE FACING. FINALLY KNOW WHO YOUR ATTACKERS ARE. LOOTED EARLIER TO THIS IDEA OF MAPPING YOUR YOUR ENDPOINTS MAPPING YOUR TAX BASE WE CALL THAT A TAX SERVICE MANAGEMENT. YOU CANNOT PROTECT YOUR INSTITUTION IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE ITS VULNERABILITIES ARE WE CALL THAT THE DIDN'T DO THAT USE LESS TECHNICAL TERMS THE DENOMINATOR. WHAT'S THE DENOMINATOR OF YOUR THREATENED INFRASTRUCTURE. ONCE YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE MUCH BETTER ABLE. TO KNOW HOW TO PROTECT IT. WE HAVE WORKED WITH GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS FOR INSTANCE IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE IDENTIFY TWICE AS MANY VULNERABLE ENDPOINTS THAN THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD. THAT'S GOOD NEWS BECAUSE IT MEANS WE CAN GO OUT AND PUT UP TECHNOLOGY APPEARS AND POINTS TO PROTECT THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHE SAID MISTER BYRD OUR NEXT- PANEL THIS IS MIKE MCNERNEY CHIEF OPERATIONS OFFICER RESILIENCE- MR MCNERNEY WELCOME AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON THE CHALLENGES OF DATA BREACHES ON THE THREATS THEY POSE TO SOCIETY AND NATIONAL SECURITY. IS NOT ISSUING SUCH A DISTINGUISHED PANEL WITNESSES HERE TODAY AND TOMORROW BUT I CAN GET TRICKY INSIGHTS INTO THIS DESTRUCTION PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS ARE RESPONSIBLE BASH. MY NAME IS MIKE MCNERNEY AND I'M THE CHIEF OPERATIONS OFFICER RESULTS ON A MILITARY VETERAN INSIDER ENTREPRENEUR AND HELD A RANGE OF POSITIONS. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT. RESILIENT FLOORING NOW IS A CYBER INSURANCE AND SECURITY STARTUP HEADQUARTERED IN SAN FRANCISCO. MOST OF OUR FOUNDERS AND EXECUTIVE TEAM ARE MILITARY VETERANS OR CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS. AND WE ARE DEDICATED TO IMPROVING CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES FOR CUSTOMERS. SUMMERS ARE GENERALLY SPEAKING ENTERPRISES THAT UNDERPIN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING FINANCIAL SERVICES AND EVEN HOSPITALS. OUR POSITION AS BOTH A CYBER SECURITY AND CYBER INSURANCE COMPANY ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES FOR CYBERSECURITY CONTROLS AND ALSO TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO BE YOURS. IT IS THIS COMBINATION OF STANDARDS AND INCENTIVES THAT IS GAINING RECENT TENSION FEDERAL POLICYMAKERS AS AN ELEMENT OF A LARGER SOLUTION TO SOME OF OUR. NATION'S CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES. SENATORS LET ME DIRECT PEOPLE ARE HURTING OUT THERE. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS CYBERSECURITY HAS GONE FROM A RELATIVELY BACKWARD ISSUE TO TOP NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT. THIS MOVE ALSO DEPENDING ON WHERE I USED TO WORK DIRECTLY TO MAIN STREET. EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS SOMEONE PERHAPS A SCHOOL PERHAPS A SMALL BUSINESS WHO IS THE IMPACTS OF DATA. BREACH OR THE IMPACTS OF RENTAL. TAYLOR EVEN OF HOSPITAL TURNING AWAY. NEEDING CRITICAL CARE DUE TO A CYBER. IN SOME CASES THIS IS EVEN LED TO INSTANCES OF DEATH OR BODILY HARM AND PEOPLE ARE TAKING NOTICE REMARKABLY IN A RECENT NATIONWIDE POLL OF REGISTERED VOTERS RESPONDED CITING QUOTE IMPROVING CYBER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND WELL. THAT'S A TOP HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE BUILD BACK BETTER PROPOSAL BUT FULLY ONE QUARTER PLACING IN THE TOP THREE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE. THIS IMPACTS ALL OF US AND SO I THINK THE SOLUTIONS. WILL ALSO REQUIRE ALL OF US. BATTERIES HER NUMBER HACKER GAINED ACCESS TO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM AND USES ACCESS YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION. WHILE WORKING AT A RECENT SELLS ONLY ONE TYPE OF MAY AND A BAD ACTOR CAN PROCEED TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM. THAT SAME ACCESS WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL PERSON IN TOWN OR ON THE SPOT AND UNMATCHED YOU SUPPOSE. AN OPERAND SOMEWHERE ESPIONAGE OR IN SOME CASES EVEN VISIBLE DAMAGE. BUT THE CHALLENGE FOR DEFENDERS AS YOU TRY TO PREVENT HACKERS FROM ENTERING THE SYSTEM. CASTLE. AND REMOVE THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. FORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME PRACTICES CAN BE IN EMPLOYEE TO IMPROVE EVERYONE. CYBER HYGIENE. WELL THERE'S NO WAY TO GUARANTEE PREVENTION ACTIONS CAN BE TAKEN THAT YOU CREATE YOUR REST AN INCREASE YOUR SITE RESULTS. FIRST AS ANY HACKER KNOWS ITS USERNAME CREDENTIAL ACCESS TO SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO USING EXPORT. THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS HOW OFTEN DATA REACHES. MANY PEOPLE'S PRIVATE INFORMATION INCLUDING PASSWORDS ON THE DARK WEB. AS A RESULT ONE OF THE FIRST PROTECTIVE MEASURES EACH MONTH FOR SCALE BUSTERS POLICY PASSWORD. AND MANY IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION. ALSO SOMETIMES KNOWN AS- I CAN TELL YOU THAT WILL YOUR CAR. AT RISK. USING DECENT. ANOTHER COMMON WASTE YOUR CREDENTIALS THIS YEAR FISHING. USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES MALICIOUS HACKERS ARE CONSTANTLY ATTEMPTING TO TRICK UNSUSPECTING USERS INTO CLICKING ON SE AND ST LOUIS SEND ME EMAIL AS SUCH INSURING YOUR ORGANIZATION HAVE STRONG EMAILS A STRONG EMAIL SECURITY HOUSE PROGRAM A CONSTANT USER TRAINING ON PHISHING AWARENESS ARE CRUCIAL. SIMILARLY ORGANIZATION SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE TECHNOLOGIES ON YOUR DOWN USER DEVICES ALSO KNOWN AS END ONCE TO HELP DETECT AND MITIGATE UNAUTHORIZED. ACCESS AFTER REACH. J. TIGER ACCESS TO ASSIST. THE NEXT THING WE TO DO A ESSENTIALLY CALL. USING WHAT'S CALLED GAS OR REMAINING SYSTEM. DNS ACTS LIKE THE PHONE BOOK AND INTERNET THIS CALL BUT LETS THE ATTACKER MIGHT BE RUNNING MANY OPERATIONS NO THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN BREACHED AND EVEN WHERE IT'S LOCATED. THE SIMPLE ACT OF ATTEMPTING TO BLOCK THAT CALL BACK COULD EFFECTIVELY NEUTERING THE CHOOSING. FINDING A CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS. I EVEN THOUGH IT IS ACCESS IS GENERALLY PREFER ATTACKER STILL DO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VULNERABILITIES IN SYSTEMS. TO MITIGATE THIS ORGANIZATION SHOULD EMPLOY A COMPREHENSIVE PAST MEDICATION MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES. THAT RESILIENCE WE SEND OUT MONTHLY ALERTS FOR CUSTOMERS ABOUT ANY KNOWN WATER BILLS AND HOW THEY CAN BE REMEDIATED THAT'S ONE OF THE EASIEST AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE THINGS WE DO TO PROTECT OUR CUSTOMERS. AS I NOTED ABOVE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PERFECT SECURITY. HOWEVER YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND YOURSELF IN A DATA BREACH THERE ARE A FEW STEPS YOU CAN TAKE A CHART TOPPER. FIRST EVERY ORGANIZATION GOOD BOOKS YOU DON'T KNOW THE PROCESS OF BUILDING PLANS AND POLICIES TO HANDLE THE SIRENS. AND DRILL THOSE PLANS DURING TABLE TOP EXERCISES. COULD LEAD. TO ANY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS STATE LEVEL DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. ALSO TAKE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANY PARTIES YOU MIGHT NEED AFTER THAT. EXAMPLES INCLUDE INCIDENT RESPONSE FORENSICS TEAMS- OFFERS. USERS CAN USE THE INSURANCE. INDUSTRY CAN ALSO BE HELPFUL. NOT ONLY CAN INSURANCE LET OF FIVE DOWN AND REACH BUT GOOD ONES ALL HAVE THESE PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS. IF THERE'S A SILVER LINING TO THE CURRENT SEVERITY OF DATA BREACHES RANSOMWARE. PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE CYBERSECURITY SERIOUSLY. DON'T YES HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE TO PLAY. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I CAN SAY THIS ADMINISTRATION IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ON CYBERSECURITY OUT OF STATE. THE PRESIDENT'S NEED MAJOR PLAYERS A WHOLE NATION EVER TO MITIGATE THE STRESS AND BEGINNING TO SEE SOME OF THE FOR SERVICE. INCLUDING IN THE NEWS TODAY. A LITTLE PART OF IS. RENTS MORGAN. WHO ALSO COMMITTED OUT OF REACH. TO THE SAME LEVEL AS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. ARE ALSO REPORTS THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT IS NEUTRALIZED SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL OPERATIONS. ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE ISN'T GOING TO TAKE DECISIVE STEPS TO MITIGATE THREATS. THREE SHOWING THE PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES CAN SOMETIMES ACT EFFECTIVELY NEW CONTRACTUAL MECHANISMS IN. PLACE FOR GOVERNMENTS FIND IT HARDER OPERATE. EXAMPLE HER NAME THE KIDNAPPING RANSOM. IN NINETEEN EIGHTIES FOR PRIVATE SECTOR ACTORS BY MELISSA MONDAY WORKS A SECOND WORK SUCCESSFULLY CAN MITIGATE THE THREAT COMBINATION BEST PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES MUCH LIKE DURING THE PREVIOUS KIDNAP AND RANSOM. INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS A KEY. ROLE TO PLAY IN CYBER SECURITY AS WELL. I SAY LEVEL CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO LEAD THE NATION AND I COMMEND THE WORK OF THIS NATURE THAT. OUR STATE HOUSE ON THE FIRST AND MOST URGENT DATA PROTECTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS AND THIS LEGISLATION ANYTIME THE MODEL FOR MANY STATES THAT ALL. STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL HELLO YES AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE ALSO WORKING DILIGENTLY ON SEVERAL INITIATIVES. THAT SAID MORE CAN STILL BE DONE. HELLO SHOULD TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THIS INCLUDES ENGAGING WITH THE CYBER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY AGENCY THE MULTI STATE INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTER I KNOW THIS. THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS ASK FOR GREATER RESOURCE FOR EXAMPLE THE ADMINISTRATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN INCLUDES A SERGEANT GRANT. WORTH OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. SECOND THE GOVERNMENT IS ELEVATED YOU SHOULD START CAPITAL CONCERN THE CITY DO THE SAME YOU TOO BYE BUILDING UPON THE SIDE STREET TASK FORCE CREATED BY JERRY BROWN ESTABLISHING A PERMANENT COMMISSION OR EVEN CREATING ANY MISSED LIKE AGENCY WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR DATA COLLECTION ANALYSIS AND STANDARD SO. FINALLY MISTAKEN ALSO REQUIRED FUND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT BASELINE SECURITY MEASURES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE OFTEN THE FRONT LINES. IN PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES AN EXISTING AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO I WOULD ONLY BENEFIT. THE CHALLENGES WE FACE SIDE STREETS ARE SERIOUS HOWEVER CALIFORNIA LEADING NATION IN THIS ISSUE AS IT DOESN'T SOMEONE ELSE WE DON'T KNOW ONE OUT OF EVERY EIGHT AMERICANS IN ADDITION CAPITAL THE WORLD. LEADER ON ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE BY WORKING TOGETHER AS A STATE WE CAN HOWEVER START TO MINISTRY SOURCES AND SURE THE INTERNET. IS FREE AND SAFE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MCNERNEY FOR THAT TESTIMONY. WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS- COLLEAGUES DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE SEARCH PANEL AT CENTRE BORDERS FROM PRESIDENT. THE CATCHER. I'D LIKE TO THANK- ON MISTER BYRD AND MR MCNERNEY FOR THE PRESENTATION. PROBABLY HAVE FORTY OR FIFTY FIVE QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD LOVE TO POSE GIVE HER TIME CONSTRAINTS SO TRY TO. ASK YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS AND- OFFER YOUR INSIGHTS- RIGHT NOW IS IT LEGALLY REQUIRED FOR A PRIVATE BUSINESS TO DISCLOSE TO THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. ARE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HACKED OR HAVE PAID OUT OF SOME SORT OF RANSOM. EIGHT SHE IS OKAY I JUST SAW A HARD I DON'T WANT TO TALK OVER MIKE- I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK ANSWER THEY MIGHT MAYBE CAN SUPPLEMENT AND THEN- THE SHORT ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD GIVE YOU A- ABSOLUTELY- UNIFORM ANSWER FOR EVERY SITUATION. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE ANSWER IS IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF DATA THAT WAS IF ANY DATA WAS BREACHED. AND EXFILTRATE IT SUCH THAT DATA BREACH LAWS ARE IMPLICATED. THEY ARE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS FOR INSTANCE WHERE THAT IS NOT IMPLICATED BECAUSE- THE RANSOM IS PAID IN FULL AND THE ATTACK IS- REVERSED FOR THE SYSTEMS ARE MADE AVAILABLE AND THERE'S NO EXFILTRATION OF DATA. SO RIGHT NOW WHEN THAT HAPPENS THERE IS NO UNIFORM LEGAL SCHEME THAT REQUIRES VICTIMS TO REPORT THAT EVENT ARE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT- HAVING THE FOLKS COLLABORATE AND BE ENGAGED WITH ONE ANOTHER SO THAT THEY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A PATTERN OF OR THERE MIGHT BE. A COMMON SOURCE- THAT IS- SERVING AS THE ACTOR. IN YOUR OPINION DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE. FAVORABLE FOR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OR EVEN AT THE CALIFORNIA LEVEL. FOR THERE TO BE- LAW DRAFTED THAT WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO EITHER PAY. R. RANSOM FOR- TO FORCIBLY DISCLOSE WIN AND INDEED A PRIVATE BUSINESS HAS BEEN HACKED. GOD AND IF ANYTHING HAS BEEN PAID OUT THERE'S TWO SCENARIOS DO YOU THINK THAT. DOES HAVE MERITS AT ALL. I'LL GIVE YOU A YEAH SO EARLIER THIS YEAR- IF PALO ALTO NETWORKS CO CHAIRED BY THE RANSOMWARE TASK FORCE WHICH WAS A PUBLIC PRIVATE- COLLABORATION TO EVALUATE BEST PRACTICES AND RAN SOMEWHERE IN THE SPACE OF DEFEATING RANSOMWARE. AND WE'RE ALIGNED WITH WHERE THAT TASK FORCE CAME OUT THAT ONE OF THE THORNIEST TOPICS THAT THE TASK FORCE CONFRONTED WHAT WAS THIS TOPIC OF SHOULD THERE BE A PROHIBITION. ON PAYING RANSOM IN THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT WOULD BE WE'VE WE'VE WHERE THE TASK FORCE CAME DOWN IS IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT AND POTENTIALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO IMPLEMENT THAT RULE MAINLY BECAUSE YOU WOULD FORCE. INSTITUTIONS IT MIGHT NOT BE READY OR CAPABLE OF DEFEATING RANSOMWARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK IS TO BE LEFT- ESSENTIALLY ON GUARD AND DEFENSELESS AND SO IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE YOU WOULD WANT TO DISABLE AN ENTITY FOR PAYING A RANSOM THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS. THE RANSOMWARE THE REASON WHY THE ATTACK SORRY THE AMOUNTS OF DAWN OPPOSITE RANSOMWARE ATTACK DOING TWO THINGS ONE THEY'RE RELYING ON HOT- UPDATED TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE OPERATING WITH AUTOMATED IN AN AUTOMATED FASHION TO THEIR TARGETING CRITICAL ENTITIES HEALTH CARE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO IMPOSE. EIGHT ABSOLUTE BAN ON RANSOMWARE PAYMENTS WE THINK THE BETTER THING IS TO GET PEOPLE PREPARED. USE TECHNOLOGY USE GOOD SYSTEMS USED TO TYPE OF HYGIENE AND MIKE IS TALKING ABOUT TO PREPARE SO DID YOU DON'T FACE A HOBSON'S CHOICE AND FINALLY THE ANSWER YOUR OTHER QUESTION WE DO BELIEVE THAT APPROPRIATE INCIDENT RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS ARE WE THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED AND THERE ARE LAWS BEING DISCUSSED IN THE U. S. CONGRESS RIGHT NOW. ON THAT TOPIC. AND WE SUPPORT THAT NO NO CLUE THE PYRAMID COLLEAGUES JUMP IN A I THINK YOU'D BE INTO. UP I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE NEW SOME MINISTRIES IS THIS IS BUT IT'S STILL SOME SORT OF CALLOUS SO I SECURE. AGENCY EITHER AS A STANDALONE OR A- SUPPORTED DIVISION WITHIN- THE AG'S OFFICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT PROPERLY STAFF CERTAINLY ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL GRANTS. I THINK WOULD BE A SMART MOVE FORWARD- MY LAST QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN- ENHANCED PENALTIES. HI IF THERE ARE ATTACKS ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WHETHER IT BE AT THE STATE LEVEL OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT IF YOU DO MOVE INTO THE AREA OF- HEALTH CARE OR GREED OR ENERGY- THAT THOSE ARE AREAS AND I KNOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- THE PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS PROPOSING A HANDS OFF POLICY WITH- WITH RUSSIA THAT THERE'S A TOLERABLE AMOUNT OF. A BREACH THAT AMERICANS THIS CAN SUSTAIN BUT IF YOU GO AFTER THESE AREAS THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A OVERT AND PROVOCATIVE MOVE NECESSITATING A- AT THE FEDERAL RESPONSE. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON CREATING ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR ATTACKS THAT HIT CERTAIN DESIGNATED CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS. YEAH BUT ON THIS ONE NOT MIKE MCNERNEY HERE- WHAT A GREAT QUESTION- HI I AM IN FAVOR I DO THINK IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE GLOVES OFF TO BE HONEST- AND TO SOME EXTENT WE'RE SEEING THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION DOING THAT- WE SAW IT YESTERDAY. ANOTHER SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW CRYPTO CURRENCIES I THINK WE HAVE- I THINK POLAND BABY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAVE THE PERSON WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT AND SAY- ATTACK UNDER CUSTODY KNOW THE RESULTS OF. INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS WE WORK WITH OUR OUR ALLIES ACROSS EUROPE IN OTHER NATIONS TO TRY TO BRING POP UPS TO JUSTICE- THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ELEVATING OUR RANKS MORE GAMES TO BE LEVEL- YOU KNOW TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS- I THINK THESE ARE ALL THE RIGHT MOVES WE DO HAVE TO BRING MUCH MORE PRESSURE TO BEAR. A LOT OF THESE- AND HE'S YOU KNOW- SENATOR THEY'RE BASED IN IN OTHER COUNTRIES- THEN WE HAVE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO- TO BRING THESE PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW OTHERWISE THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE. WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO I AM IN FAVOR. PLEASE ENTIRELY. FIVE BUSINESS MODEL I MEAN. YOU'RE LOCATED ANOTHER PART OF THE- PRESUMABLY- IN AREAS OR IN COUNTRIES. THAT DON'T HAVE A STRONG RELATIONS WITH THE U. S. OR EVEN. EXTRADITION AGREEMENTS WITH THE U. S. LIFE WE DON'T ELEVATE THIS DIED AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND I DON'T. I DON'T JUST MEAN THE FEDERAL. THE GIRL. WAS HACKED. AW IT WITHDREW THE RATES WERE PROCESS AND HAD TO MAKE A DECISION DUDE. DID HE PAY OR NOT. AND REACHING OUT TO THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES THEY WERE SO OVERWHELMED. THAT IT LITERALLY WAS. A SPEED BUMP THAT TYPE OF RESPONSE- THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. TWENTY CENTER BORDERS- CENTER NUMBER. THANK YOU CENTER BOARDS PERFECT SEGUE- IN TERMS OF FORMING SOME SORT OF CYBER SECURITY AGENCY I INVITE YOU TO JOIN SENATOR MEN SENATOR STERN AND ME- IN OUR ENDEAVOR. TO DO JUST THAT NOW FOCUSES ON CYBER TERRORISM BUT IT'S REALLY THE SAME FAMILY OF- MISCREANTS I THINK THAT THAT ARE BOTH STEALING AND CREATING OTHER KINDS OF TURMOIL. A COUPLE THINGS- ALSO WITH RESPECT TO INCREASE PENALTIES- I'M ALL FOR INCREASING PENALTIES I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS ACTUALLY- IDENTIFYING IN APPREHENDING THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THESE CRIMES- AND THEN THAT'S MY QUESTION- I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WE ARE. CONTINUING TO FOCUS I'VE NOT HEARD OF ANY SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION- WITH RESPECT TO IDENTITY THEFT- OF ANY GREAT MAGNITUDE OR ANY SORT OF RANSOMWARE PROSECUTION AND PERHAPS YOU CAN EDUCATE ME AND ALSO EDUCATE US AS TO WHAT WE MIGHT BE DOING. AS A STATE A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTION AND THEN SECONDLY SECOND PART OF MY QUESTION FOR EITHER OR BOTH OF YOU. IS BOB I'M JUST LOOKING AT MY COMPUTER RIGHT NOW I HAVE TWO EMAILS THAT ARE SUSPECT ONE FOR MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY ONE FROM MY BANK THEY BOTH LOOK VERY OFFICIAL I I'D LOOK JUST TO SEE I DON'T. I DON'T THE WHOLE THANK YOU CENTER BOARD JUST I APPRECIATE YOU TRANSFERRING TEN MILLION DOLLARS ALL I NEED TO DO IS SEND YOU. A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YOU'RE GONNA SEND ME TEN MILLION BUT WHAT BUT IT LOOKS VERY AUTHENTIC AND THEN LETS YOU LOOK AT THE ADDRESS. YOU CAN'T TELL THAT IT'S NOT FROM THE ACTUAL ENTITY THAT PURPORTS TO BE FROM. AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY SO FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN MY BANK IS TOLD THAT THERE'S A MESSAGE COMING PURPORTEDLY FROM THEM THAT LOOKS VERY OFFICIAL DO THEY HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD THEY HAVE ANY RESPONSIBLE SAME THING WITH A CREDIT CARD. IT LOOKS LIKE IT COMES FROM THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY LOOKS VERY OFFICIAL TELLS ME THAT I NEED TO MAKE AT LEAST IN THE SUBJECT LINE SOME SORT OF PAYMENT IT'S FALSE. IN ANY EVENT WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND LASTLY THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR VERY- IMPORTANT TESTIMONY THANK YOU MR MCNERNEY FOR YOUR SERVICE WERE UP ON THE EVE OF VETERANS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. ALL RIGHT I'LL LEAVE THE TWO OF YOU TO RESPOND. ALL RIGHT I CAN MAYBE PICK UP A CENTER WHERE I LEFT OFF AND I'M I'M HAPPY. TO YIELD TO THE BRUCE IS WELL- ON THE FIRST OF ALL WAIT WELL I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WE SEE SOME PROSECUTIONS BUT I WANT TO SAY MOST OF THOSE HAVE BEEN ABOUT. ESPIONAGE AND IT ENDED IN A LOT AT LEAST HIGH PROFILE ONES- ALTHOUGH I DO THINK HE'D BE RANSOMWARE- WHEN'S IT COMING I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DESTRUCTION. MAKING THIS MUCH% NOISE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE. SOMETHING IN MIND SO- I THINK SHE PROBABLY YOU KNOW STAY TUNED ON THAT BUT YOUR LARGER POINT ABOUT THIS BEING. DIFFICULT IS EXACTLY CORRECT. IT'S VERY HARD TO ATTRIBUTE. TO TRIBUTE- YOU KNOW THESE ACTIONS. ARE IN CYBERSPACE AND EVEN WHEN YOU DO THE WRONG COUNTRIES WHERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KIND OF. YOU KNOW GET OUT ON- BUT YOU CAN- YOU KNOW. THE UNITED STATES ONE QUITS ITS YOU KNOW WE- I IT IS. GOOD AT. MY AND SO I WE ALL. THE ARE THINGS THE LEVEL WE ELEVATE. THEM TO MATCH. AS I MENTIONED ON THIS HAPPENED RECENTLY I THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND A LOT MORE ROOM- WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BRING ALL OF THEM TO JUSTICE BUT I DO THINK WE WILL. HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE BACK WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO THINGS DIPLOMATICALLY WORK WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND AGAIN. WE SEE A LOT MORE THAT. THE SAMPLE THAT WE WILL BE AND I THINK IT'LL BE- I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE SO THAT'S- THAT'S GREAT YOUR SECOND QUESTION IS A GREAT ONE AS WELL- I WOULD ADD ONE OTHER LEVEL OF NEW WANTS TO THAT- I JUST RECEIVED ONE OF THESE. YOU KNOW FAKE. CREDIT CARD- EMAILS THE OTHER DAY ON AND- IT pADDRESS IS BECAUSE THE ATTACKER HAD- ALL. ACCESS THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN SOUTH DAKOTA- AND WAS. USING THEIR SYSTEM. AS A LAUNCHING POINT TO SEND. OUR STATE EMAILS LOOKING FOR ARE YOU HOPING I WOULD CLICK ON IT AND THEN GIVE THEM MY BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION. SO IT'S NOT JUST THE BANK IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME I HAVE HEARD THE VICTIM WAS ALSO. THIS KIND OF ERROR. RT WHERE- YOU MAY MAYBE I'M BEING. TO POSTING ABOUT ACTOR IN BARN. OUR MISSILES. TO FOR EVERYONE REALLY NOT JUST ABOUT MUST FOR EVERY- T. PRIESTS THERE. HI INCREASE THEIR SIZE. POSTURE UNDER WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR- FOLLOW. BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE ONE OF THESE THINGS AND PUMP. THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF LOOK EVERYBODY. ARE GAINING EXACTLY CAN. ALL MOVE BACK TO PROCESS ARE. SECURE YOU LIKE TO ADD A- JUST A FEW QUICK ANSWER FOR. FIRST OF ALL I AGREE IT IS IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. THE ATTACKERS AND THEREFORE PROSECUTIONS ARE A REAL. BUT WE ARE SEEING SOME SUCCESS IN THE- DESTRUCTION OF THEIR NETWORKS SHE'S RIGHT. AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN A FAIR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE RANSOM PAID IN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK WAS RECOVERED AND THAT'S BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- THE- ON THE BROADER LONG FORCE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. USED EXISTING FINANCIAL SERVICES LAW CONCERNING CREEK DR CRYPTO EXCHANGES AND ACTUALLY DISRUPTED THE FINANCIAL SUPPLY CHAIN IF YOU WILL THAT THE ATTACKER WAS USING I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THAT. BEFORE WE SEE MORE PROSECUTIONS. AS FOR THE- WHAT WHAT WHAT CAN GOVERNMENT LIKE LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT YOU I THINK THERE IS I'LL JUST- I'LL EMPHASIZE ONE BIG CONCEPT WHICH IS COLLABORATION AND PART OR AND OUR PARTNERSHIP. WE'VE SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF BENEFIT FROM A PUBLIC PRIVATE COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION IN DEFEATING CYBER SECURITY OR AT LEAST PREPARING ORGANIZATIONS TO GET THEIR SYSTEMS READY TO DEFEND AGAINST CYBERTHREATS- I'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- WE- WORKED WITH. THE WITH VISA AND OTHER AGENCIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN- YOU RECALL EARLIER SHE THIS YEAR THERE WAS A- VULNERABILITY IDENTIFIED WITH MICROSOFT EXCHANGE SERVERS. WE WERE ABLE TO HELP IDENTIFY WHERE THE- VULNERABLE SOFTWARE INSTANCES WERE. AND WE DID SO IN A LEGALLY COMPLIANT FASHION AND THEN WE'RE ABLE IN A LEGALLY COMPLIANT FASHION TO SHARE THAT WITH THE RIGHT GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THAT YOU DISTRIBUTE FASHION TO POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE INSTITUTIONS AND USERS THAT WAS A GOOD COLLABORATION I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE THAT I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY A ROLE FOR STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THOSE COLLABORATIONS FINALLY YOUR POINT ABOUT. A PHISHING SCAMS IN THE ROLE WHAT WHAT RESPONSIBILITY TO DO- DO THE DO THE TWO COMPANIES HAVE I THINK ANY CONSUMER FACING COMPANY NEEDS TO HAVE GOOD HYGIENE PRACTICES RIGHT I KNOW THE BANKS HAVE. EXCELLENT HYGIENE PRACTICES THERE'S ALSO A HUGE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT. I THINK THE CONSUMER FACING ORGANISATIONS DO A LOT OF EDUCATING THEIR CONSUMER BASE TO SAY THESE ARE THE TYPES OF EMAILS AND COMMUNICATIONS YOU RECEIVE FROM US. IF IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS DON'T ACT ON IT BUT I THINK THAT I'VE SEEN ARE REALLY EFFECTIVE- EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION COMING OUT OF. GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS TO CONTINUALLY REFRESH- THE AVERAGE YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE PERSON'S UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS OR IS NOT STATE SPACE. IN IN THE ON THE INTERNET. THANK YOU LET ME JUST FOLLOW UP A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS- I'M- SOLICITOUS OF SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THAT KIND OF COOPERATION I SUPPOSE THIS INCENTIVIZE NON COOPERATION THAT THAT'S POINT NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IS I MENTIONED GETTING- OF. PHISHING EMAIL FROM SOME IMPORTS TO BE MY BANK. TODAY MY BANK CONTINUALLY ASK ME FOR MORE INFORMATION THEY CONTINUALLY ASK ME NOT TO- REQUIRE PAPER STATEMENTS BUT TO REQUIRE JUST TO PROVIDE FOR ELECTRONIC STATEMENTS. AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE IS A SPACE FOR US TO. REQUIRE THAT WHEN YOU'RE PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION THAT THE ENTITYHAS SOME SORT OF OBLIGATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO THAT AT LEAST SOMETHING TO NOTIFY THEIR CONSUMERS THAT THAT. YOU MAY RECEIVE SOMEHOW THEY GOT MY INFORMATION TO THE BANK THAT I USE THAT YOU MAY RECEIVE YOU KNOW SCAMMY. EMAILS AND HERE'S HOW TO JUST TO YOUR POINT HERE'S HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF THEY HAVE SOME OBLIGATION ALSO I THINK. TO ENGAGE IN THIS ACTIVITY PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO SENIORS. THE SENIORS ARE TARGETED IN SOMETIMES VULNERABLE POPULATION- AND- THAT SEEMS LIKE A SPACE IN WHICH WE MIGHT WANNA OPERATE ANYWAY THE INTEREST IN YOUR THOUGHTS. SO- ALTHOUGH IT WAS DARK BUT- CENTER SO- ACTUALLY LET ME- LET ME SAY ALSO- HAPPY OUT RUSSIANS DO YOU AS WELL- ALSO GREAT- GREAT QUESTIONS- I THINK CLEARLY THE STATE CAN BE MORE- I THINK- THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES LIKE FOR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND THE- THE- AGENCY THAT WORKS FOR THEM CALLED NEXT. THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR- TO SET- NEW CYBER SECURITY HYGIENE STANDARDS USING VOLUNTARY STANDARDS AND IT WILL BE ADOPTED. NATIONWIDE BUT- I DON'T FOLLOW THE NETWORKS OTHERS YOU WERE INVOLVED IN TRYING TO SET SOME OF THE STANDARDS TO TRY TO. HELP EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND PROTECT INFORMATION- THAT WE MAYBE- ARE YOU KNOW REALLY GET CUSTOMER INFORMATION HOW DO YOU PROTECT THAT HOW TO PROTECT OURSELVES. AND THEN ADOPT THEM- AND YOU KNOW WE CAN GO A STEP FURTHER AS WELL WE COMMIT- TO- PRESENTS A WHOLE OUR CUSTOMERS. TO THEIR STANDARDS ON THE RIGHT. SO THERE ARE THINGS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN YOU ARTICLE SAYS STANDARDS AND SEE IF THEY ARE FORCED THERE'S NO REASON THE STATE CAN'T HELP- DO SIMILAR THINGS RIGHT- I THINK BRUCE ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER. COLLABORATION AND DATA SHARING- AND THAT KIND OF STUFF WILL ALWAYS BE REALLY HELPFUL IT CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED- AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO REQUIRE STATE. AND LOCAL ENTITIES TO MEET A CERTAIN LEVEL OF HYGIENE- YOUR SECURITY STANDARDS- THEMSELVES- COURSE YOUR FINAL POINT. YOU KNOW WHEN- WHEN IN OF THE CALL I. PRIVATE FROM FROM. ANYONE DO YOU HAVE AN ELEVATOR STANDARD- TO TAKE. AWAY YOU KNOW LOT MORE OBLIGATION TO TAKE CARE NEXT BE A- ONE THAT ALL THE SERIES. AND I CAN YOU KNOW SO HELP IS LED THE WAY MAKING A REGULAR. AND LEGAL- OR MAY. AGAIN LEADING THE IN THINGS LIKE THAT RUGE. SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A R. AS WELL TELL ME SOMETHING. SO WE WELCOME YOUR C. S. TO HOW WE CAN AGAIN INCENTIVIZE. COOPERATION COLLABORATION AND THIS IS WHAT'S THIS INCENTIVIZE. THE FAILURE TO DO SO. THANK YOU SENT- I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON INCENTIVES- I OBVIOUSLY WANT TO INCENTIVIZE COLLABORATION COOPERATION- BUT I'M ALSO HEARING THAT. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BEEF UP CYBERSECURITY PROTOCOLS- THERETHERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES THAT WE WOULD WANT THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO TOP WHETHER THAT SOME OF THE WAR GAME TYPE SELF ASSESSMENTS THAT- SOME YOU HAVE ALLUDED TO- WHETHER THAT'S- YOU KNOW JUST DEVOTING RESOURCES OR OTHERWISE- AND I'M CURIOUS ABOUT. WHAT IDEAS YOU HAVE ON GOVERNMENT POLICIES STATE GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT CAN HELP ENCOURAGE TAKE UP. OF SOME OF THESE BASIC CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW ARE LACKING ACROSS LARGE SWATHS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR I'M NOT SURE IF YOU MR MCNERNEY- YOU KNOW CAN WE SEE INSURANCE USING A LOT OF PLACES AS A WAY TO TRY TO INCENTIVIZE A PRUDENT PRACTICES ARE BEST. BEST PRACTICES WHETHER THAT'S CAR INSURANCE HEALTH INSURANCE OR OTHERWISE- WE KNOW WE GET PREMIUMS FOR YOU KNOW- GETTING IN ACCIDENTS OR OR TRAFFIC INCIDENTS OR WHATNOT. DO YOU SEE A SIMILAR ROLE FOR CYBER INSURANCE AS MAYBE BEING A PATHWAY TO- INCURSION PRIVATE COMPANIES TO ADOPT BEST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES. AND IF SO- MAYBE COLLABORATE ALSO ELABORATE ON WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE MORE CYBER INSURANCE BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A NASCENT INDUSTRY. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR- I DO FEEL THAT WAY IF I CONTINUE TO BE TO BE DIRECT- I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CYBER INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ALL THAT HELPFUL IN THIS REGARD YES- IT'S RELATIVELY IMMATURE INDUSTRY- AND SPOTTING RANSOMWARE- WHICH IS CALLED A SURGE EARLIER TODAY I THINK IS EXACTLY RIGHT. THAT IS CHANGE THE MARKET I THINK IT IS AND IT SHOULD NOT BE MARKET IS- BECAUSE INSURERS- TO KIND OF WAKE UP TO THE CHALLENGES IN A WAY THAT MAYBE DIDN'T BEFORE. BECAUSE THE LOSSES ARE SO TREMENDOUS RIGHT AND REALIZED IMMEDIATELY IN A VERY LARGE AND SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A CONTRACTION IN THE MARKET- A LESSENING OF SUPPLY OR DEMAND IS GOING UP- AND THAT IS ACTUALLY A LEADING- YOU KNOW THOSE OF US THAT ARE THAT ARE CONTINUING TO OFFER CYBER INSURANCE. I HAVE A BIGGER HAND IN IN WHAT WE ARE YOU KNOW KIND OF REQUIRE OF OUR CUSTOMERS. AND OUR VISION I DO THINK THE MARKET IS HEADED THIS WAY IS A LOT MORE LIKE YOU DESCRIBE. WITH DRIVERS INSURANCE OR OR LIFE INSURANCE WERE YOU CAN'T ENGAGE IN RISKY BEHAVIOR EXPECTS. TO GET LIFE INSURANCE YOU CAN'T GO YOU KNOW- LIGHTING AND EXPECT THAT LIFE LIFE INSURANCE RIGHT- CYBERSECURITY INSURANCE IS HEADED THAT WAY- LAST YEAR- WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY I'VE- BEEN TELLING YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THIS WAS LAST YEAR. BUT THIS YEAR LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED MY TESTIMONY YOU DON'T HAVE MULTI. FACTOR AUTHENTICATION YOU PROBABLY CAN'T- THAT IS NEW DATA ON THIS AND I THAT TREND I THINK HE'S GOING TO- AND SO THIS THAT IS MOST HELPFUL TO US. THE SHARES WERE. IN DAY. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE- THE STATE AND- HELP US- YOU KNOW JACK'S. TO WHAT CONTROLS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO PREVENT ANY BREACH- WHAT DID DAMAGES LOOK LIKE. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WILL HELP US DETERMINE- YOU KNOW WHAT OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS SHE BASED ON THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY GOING TO- AND THEN YOU KNOW AGAIN AS I MENTIONED. ARE REQUIRING. OR REQUESTING A WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO THAT THAT- STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE AN ELEVATED- CYBER SECURITY LEVEL OF HYGIENE BEFORE BY THE WAY MANY MUNICIPALITIES ARE QUALIFIED FOR CYBER INSURANCE. ON IT VERY HARD TO GET IT- BECAUSE THE CONTROLS ARE SO POOR RIGHT SO- YOU KNOW HAVING THEM I HAVE THE RESOURCES AS WELL AS THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO INCREASE OUR CYBERSECURITY POSTURE. ALL RIGHTS ARE AND HAVE YOU BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMISSIONER LAWRENCE OFFICE AROUND- WHAT WE CAN DO TO. BEEF UP AND. AND REALLY EXPAND US EVER INSURANCE. US SENATOR WE HAVE NOT YET OTHERS MAY- I KNOW ARE ON OUR LIST. BUT- OUR COMPANY'S NOT. BAD AND- I WANT TO TAKE THIS QUESTION YOU MISTER BYRD IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK AGAIN TO THE POINT OF NOT JUST COLLABORATION COOPERATION BUT BEGINNING FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO. YOU JUST A TOP BASIC CYBERSECURITY PROTOCOLS IT'S GREAT TO HAVE STANDARDS BUT- I THINK AN IMPORTANT. NEXT STEP IS TO ENSURE THAT R TRY TO INCENTIVIZE- PRIVATE COMPANIES TO TAKE UP THOSE MEASURES AND I GUESS. YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF POLICY WE THINK OF CARROTS AND STICKS. WHAT THE CARROTS AND STICKS YOU THINK MIGHT BE HELPFUL COMING FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT THAT MIGHT INCREASE ADOPTION OF CYBER SECURITY BEST PRACTICES. WELL FIRST I THINK THAT- I'LL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON. CARROTS. ONE ONE THING IS OUR TOP DOWN LEADERSHIP. I THINK THAT. ABOUT ONE ONE VALUABLE ACTIVITY THAT STATE GOVERNMENT CAN DO. IS ENSURE THAT ITS OWN HOUSES IN ORDER FROM A CYBER SECURITY STANDPOINT- THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN SPENDING AND- YOU KNOW. LAVISHLY ON EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF NEW TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. BUT THERE ARE SOME THESE FRAMEWORKS ARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK. EVALUATING THEM AND ENSURING WITH YOUR OWN- CYBER PROFESSIONALS THAT YOU ARE JUST HOLDING- CYBER SECURITY PROTECTION ON YOUR EXISTING IT SYSTEMS BUT YOU ARE REALLY MAKING IT AN INTEGRAL PART OF YOUR PROCUREMENT PLANS AND YOUR TECHNOLOGY ROADMAPS. SIX PURSUANT TO ALREADY ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORKS THAT WE KNOW CAN WORK I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GREAT WAY TO INCENTIVIZE GOOD BEHAVIOR. TO I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS AND FIGURE OUT WHERE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS EXIST WHY WHY AREN'T CERTAIN BUSINESSES- ASSESSING OUR OR EMPLOYING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND FIGURING OUT WHERE THOSE RESOURCE HOLES ARE- IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT OR LEGITIMATE RESOURCE PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER A MANDATE ALONE WOULD SOLVE IT AND SO- I GUESS THAT LEADS TO THE THIRD POINT WHICH IS YOU CAN'T PROTECT SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW NEEDS PROTECTING. SO I THINK THAT- FIGURING OUT YOU KNOW WAYS TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE MOST VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ARE- AND THEN PRIORITIZING THOSE SYSTEMS IS A GOOD WAY TO AT LEAST MARSHAL RESOURCES- AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD FOCUS ON- PARTNER- I THINK THAT A- COLLABORATION THAT INVOLVES. THE UNIQUE. CAPABILITIES AS PARTICULARLY LAW ENFORCEMENT ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES OF GOVERNMENT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF CYBER SECURITY COMPANIES HAVE- TO UNDERSTAND EMERGING THREATS AND THE LAW THE- VISIBILITY THAT. PRIVATE INDUSTRY CAN US INTO THE- THEIR THEIR RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS I THINK A PARTNERSHIP IN THAT AREA IS THE BEST WAY TO MOVE FORWARD. GOT IT THANK YOU MISTER BYRD- SO MOVING TO THE I GUESS PUBLIC SECTOR- YOU KNOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GOVERNMENT PROTECTING ITS OWN HOUSES YOU PUT MISTER BYRD WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE SEEN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS STATES LIKE. ARE THEIR MODELS THAT WE CAN LOOK TO THAT THAT MIGHT HELP INFORM US AS WE PROCEED DOWN THE LINE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FRIDAY YES. SIR WOULD YOU MISTER BYRD. I JUST HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF- I WOULD I WOULD SAY THE MOST NOTABLE THAT COMES TO MIND IS SMETHING THAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH AND THAT IT PROBABLY DESERVES A LITTLE BIT OF STUDY IS THAT THERE IS A- PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN THE NORTH JUST IN NORTH DAKOTA DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE- THE CYBER SECURITY CAPABILITIES ACROSS AGENCIES ACROSS ACROSS INSTITUTIONS AND IT'S DONE IN A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. I WOULD SAY THAT IS A GOOD MODEL FOR HOW A STATE STATE ACTORS CAN INCENTIVIZE GOOD BEHAVIOR AND THEN HELPED PUSH RESOURCES OUT TO WHERE IT'S NEEDED MOST- ALSO I CAN I THINK WE CAN'T. IGNORE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCENTIVES HOW TO HOW TO INSURE THAT CYBER DEFENSES ARE PUSHED OUT MORE HOLISTICALLY TO WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED THEN THE RECENTLY ENACTED OR ARE SOON TO BE SIGNED- INFRASTRUCTURE LEGISLATION. I HAVE SEVERAL INTERESTING. REGARDING CYPRUS I THINK THE TOTAL AMOUNT- APPROPRIATED FOR CYBER SECURITY IS ROUGHLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. BUT THEY ARE THERE IS A STATE OR LOCAL PROGRAM GRANT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY THAT LAW. WE THINK IT COULD BE A REALLY COMPELLING- ELEMENT OF THAT LAW TO OVERCOME RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS- AT THE STATE BUT ALSO PARTICULARLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT GRANT PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT. I THINK EVERY OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS SHOULD PROBABLY GET- INFORMED ABOUT. AND I SHOULD PROBABLY RELYING ON CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS TO HELP IDENTIFY THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A GRANT REQUEST. MENTAL HEALTH CENTER HOW TO ADD TO THAT REALLY QUICKLY I'M A BIG FAN OF EXERCISING- AND SO- YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT YOU'RE ABLE TO USE POWER WE ASKED OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. TO GO THROUGH CYBER INCIDENT I KNOW I THINK I ALWAYS BEEN A VERY BIG ONE I'LL GO THROUGH THAT AND IT. WILL BECOME APPARENT RIGHT YOU MAY NOT BE JUST TECHNOLOGICAL MEDIA PEOPLE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT PLACES MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TRAINING OR COULD BE PROCESSES RIGHT- SO I WOULD SAY PEOPLE PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY AND DO A- DO A COUPLE EXERCISES AND SEE WHAT SHAKES OUT AND THEN I THINK HE'S- GOING. TO COME UP WILL BECOME VERY. GREAT THANK YOU I'M JUST TWO MORE QUESTIONS- FIRST- GOING. TO THE QUESTION A STANDALONE AGENCY- YEAH WE KNOW THAT THERE IS THE WORKING GROUP ON ACCOUNT- YES- BUT- WHAT WOULD YOU SEE IS THE KEY ATTRIBUTES AND RESOURCES AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS. IF WE WERE TO TRY TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE AND ROBUST. STANDALONE AGENCY WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE- AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO ADAPT TO ONGOING- YOU KNOW DEVELOPING- TRANSFORMING THREATS WHAT. WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT FOR A STANDALONE AGENTS. I'LL START WITH YOU MR MCNERNEY. THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK WE CAN TAKE SOME LESSONS MAYBE FROM FROM THE FEDERAL EXPERIENCE HERE IT'S A REALLY TOUGH QUESTION- CYBER SECURITY IS VERY COST CUTTING- YOUNG CALLOW YES HAS A TREMENDOUS- PART OF THIS AS I MENTIONED THE NATIONAL GUARD HOW DOES THE STATE CIO AND CISO- AND SO YOU'RE MAYBE EXPECTED TO TAKE LESSONS FROM. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH ADAM HOW'RE I NEED TO SEE LIKE SEA SALT- AND GIVEN IT. WE YOU HAVE MORE ABOUT IBM HOW TO SEVERAL. ONE OF THE- THAT SPACE WORKS AND ALL OTHER THEIR THEIR SCIENCE YOUR REQUIREMENTS. YEAH I LOVE THE MODEL OF THIS ARE WE HAVE A NEW STANDARD COMMERCE- THAT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO COLLECT DATA ANALYZE DATA- AND PUT OUT STANDARDS. AND THEN FINALLY YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW AN EXPERIMENT WITH A NEW NATIONAL CYBER RECORD THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT- SOMEONE HAS A YEAR TO THE PRESIDENT. OUGHT TO HELP- YOU KNOW SHOW THAT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE- AND THE DRIVE DOWN DECISIONS ARE YOU FROM THE TOP ALL THE WAY ON DOWN SO. I THINK ANY ONE OF THOSE THINGS MAYBE ALL THOSE COULD BE CERTAIN FOR CALIFORNIA CONSIDER GANGS IT'S SUCH A CROSSCUTTING ISSUE- EFFECTS SO MANY DIFFERENT AGENCIES. PRIVATE SECTOR AND PEOPLE AS WELL. MR THOUGHTS. REALLY QUICK NUMBER ONE I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO YOU KNOW THIS INSTANCE- AGENCY TO HAVE BUILT IN SKEPTICISM MEANING IT'S IT NEEDS ITS OWN RED TEAM SO THAT IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATING THE CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AGENCY THAT'S BECAUSE THE ATTACK. MELODIES THE ATTACKERS CAPABILITIES ARE EVOLVING SO QUICKLY IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE SOME SOME BUILT IN. HE PROBABILITY TO CHALLENGE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ENSURE THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS IT'S NOT THE POINT THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION UPSTART TECHNOLOGY YOU'RE AWARE OF IT. AND THERE ARE RESOURCES AVAILABLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT BUT DIDN'T INFORMATION ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND THE MOST UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT THE TAX THAT'S ONE THING THE SECOND THING IS- MAKE SURE THAT THIS AGENCY. ONE OF ITS PRIMARY MISSIONS IS EDUCATION. IT NEEDS TO BE THE SOURCE FOR SMALL BUSINESS LARGE BUSINESS OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IT NEEDS TO BE THAT SOURCE THAT CAMPBELL H. YES REQUEST FOR UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION BUT ALSO PUSHES OUT INFORMATION SO THAT- YOU HAVE THE MOST INFORMED- GROUP OF ACTORS GROUP OF POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE INSTITUTIONS AS IT CAN BE. THANK YOU MISTER BYRD LAST QUESTION FOR ME- IS SO I DON'T YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED A CAL SECURE INTERMITTENT C. FRAMEWORK ON CYBER SECURITY BUT- JUST LIKE MAYBE A QUICK THIRTY SECOND REACTION YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUICK THOUGHTS THAT NOT LIKE A DEEP DIVE HERE BUT- YEAH AND I SHOULD ADD THAT I ASSEMBLYWOMAN JACQUI IRWIN AND I ARE GONNA BE HOLDING A HEARING ON THAT AT SOME POINT IN YOUR FUTURE- JOINT HEARING BUT- WOULD JUST BE INTERESTED IN YOUR TAKE AWAYS WHAT COMPLETES A GOOD SORT OF BOOKING THE IMPROVED- WHAT WHAT'S YOUR QUICK REACTION. ALSO SENATOR I HAVEN'T- IT YET BUT I'M HAPPY TO DO SO RIGHT AND WRONG. THANK YOU MR MCNERNEY. I THINK I AM I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE THINGS THAT I. FIND MOST COMPELLING ABOUT IT ARE PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH- WHAT I'VE ALREADY SAID SO THE RISK OF REPEATING MYSELF I JUST I GIVE YOU I BROKE AND TOOK SOME NOTES DOWN BEFORE THIS HEARING. THE FACT THAT IT'S- IT HAS BOUGHT IT IT APPEARS THAT BUYING FROM LEADERSHIP IS KEY. YOU'VE GOT UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW TONE FROM THE TOP. MATTERS AND IT HAS TO BE PERSISTENT TRUE- A ROAD MAP. THAT THAT STITCHES TOGETHER THE PEOPLE AND THE PROCESSES AND THE TECHNOLOGY IS GREAT BUT FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE MEASURING OUT. RIGHT YOU'LL YOU'LL SUCCEED AT WHAT YOU MEASURE SO I WOULD SAY IT IT REFLECTS SOME MEASURE MEASURING OF SUCCESS THAT'S CRITICAL DON'T LET THAT FALL TO THE WAYSIDE. AND- REQUIRING THE AGENCIES TO TESTING ANNUALLY THAT THEY HAVE ACHIEVED CERTAIN CAPABILITIES IS THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY GOOD LOOKING PIECE OF pYOU MISTER BYRD THANK YOU MR MCNERNEY FOR YOUR TIME AND EXPERTISE- WE'LL BE MOVING ON SIR MR OMBRES SANTORUM HAS A QUESTION IT'S VERY VERY QUICKLY- AND I THINK SENATOR EXCUSE ME I THINK MISTER BYRD RAISE THIS ISSUE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR OWN HOUSE IN. IT APPS YOU CAN RESPOND TO THIS EITHER MISTER BERGER MR MCNERNEY. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE ASSESSMENT IS TO STATE FUNCTIONS AND THEIR- RESILIENCE TO. CYBER THREATS IF WE HAVE GREAT IF WE-HAVE NOT I WOULD SUGGEST TO CHAIRMAN MEN THAT THAT MAY BE A USEFUL EXERCISE FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO BEGIN. GERMAN ANY ANY RESPONSE THAT. AS NOTED IN MY OPENING REMARKS WE AT PALO ALTO NETWORKS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS ARE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CALIFORNIA AGENCIES WE'RE WE'RE HONORED TO DO THAT WELL WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS WHETHER THAT KIND OF MORE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENTS BEEN DONE AND I THINK GETTING AN ANSWER FIGURING OUT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A REALLY GOOD ONE. AND IF THE ANSWER IS IT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. YOU KNOW THE OUR INDUSTRY CAN HELP YOU DO IT. BUSSER I BELIEVE WE HAVE ALSO ADDED YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S TIME TO DO ANOTHER ONE EVEN IF YOU HAVE THAT ONE RIGHT SO I THINK THESE EXERCISES ARE INVALUABLE AND WE'RE DOING YOU KNOW- YEAH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER NUMBER AND THANK YOU TO MISTER BYRD MR MCNERNEY FOR YOUR TIME AND EXPERTISE. I WILL B NOW MOVING ON OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH IS FOCUSED ON STATE AND LOCAL CONSIDERATIONS. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS JOHN M. GILLIGAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR. THE CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY- MISTER GILLIGAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR APPEARING TODAY AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU OUR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO THE HEARING TODAY. HI MY NAME IS JOHN GILLIGAN AND I SERVE AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE NON PROFIT CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY OR C. I. S. AN ORGANIZATION THAT THAT HOUSES ONE OF ITS FOCUS IS IMPROVING. THE CYBERSECURITY OF STATE LOCAL TRIBAL AND TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATIONS. MOST OF MY CAREER IN SERVICE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INCLUDING SERVING AS THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER BOTH THE US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. AND THE UNITED STATES AIRFORCE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO SHARE OUR THOUGHTS ON THE CURRENT STATE OF CYBERSECURITY WITHIN STATE LOCAL AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS AND I COMMEND THE CALIFORNIA SUN ON THE CREATION OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. ASI WILL DISCUSS IN A FEW MINUTES IT'S ESSENTIAL BUT STATE LEGISLATURES TAKE A PROACTIVE ROLE IN ESTABLISHING THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES AND EXPECTATIONS ARE METRICS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE CYBERSECURITY ACROSS THEIR STATE. TODAY I'D LIKE TO FIRST PROVIDE A SHORT BACKGROUND ABOUT CIS. SECOND BRIEFLY DESCRIBE A SET OF PROVEN BEST PRACTICES WE CALL ESSENTIAL CYBER HYGIENE BUT CIOS RECOMMENDS FOR ALL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS. AND THIRD SUMMARIZE THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN A RECENT REPORT C. I. ASCO DEVELOPED FOR GOVERNORS AND STATE LEGISLATORS REGARDING ESTABLISHING GOVERNANCE AS A NECESSARY FOUNDATION AND UNLIKE SOME OTHER RAIDER AND IMPROVING STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY- SOME BACKGROUND ON THE CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY. ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AS A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION THE PRIMARY MISSION OF CIOS IS TO ADVANCE CYBERSECURITY READINESS AND RESPONSE SHE I ALSO WORKS WITH THE GLOBAL SECURITY COMMUNITY USING COLLABORATIVE DELIBERATIVE PROCESS SEES TO DEFINE SECURITY BEST PRACTICES FOR USE BY GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES. IN ADDITION SYNONYMOUS OPERATES THE MULTI STATE INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTER OR MS ISAC AND THE ELECTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTER OR E. I AND I SAID. THESE ORGANIZATION HAVE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND STATE LOCAL TRIBAL AND TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATING. INCLUDING ALMOST A THOUSAND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE AMAZIGH SACK AND THE E. ISAC MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A SORT OF SUPPORTING SERVICES INCLUDING CYBER BEST PRACTICES EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES CYBER THREAT INDICATORS SHARING AND TRAVELERS. MONITORING OF NETWORKS AND ENDPOINTS AS WELL AS CYBER INCIDENT RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. SECOND I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDED CYBER SECURITY BEST PRACTICE LET ME FIRST START WITH SOME CONTRACTS FOR A BEST PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE WITH REGARDING THE CYBER SECURITY IS WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL A FOG OF MORE. HAVING BEEN A CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AT SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS I HAVE SEEN THE FOG OF WAR FIRST HAND. MANY WELL INTENDED BUT COSTLY CYBER SECURITY EFFORTS TO RESTORE KRISTIN FRY MINUTE OVERLAPPING TOOLS FROM WANT TO DOCTORS RESULTING IN LITTLE ACTUAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE CYBERSECURITY RESILIENCE OF THE ORGANIZATION. AND LEADING TO REPEATED EMBARRASSMENTS AS THE ORGANIZATION FALLS VICTIM TO RANSOMWARE. OR BREACH OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA OR SOME OTHER CYBER ATTACK. AS A PERSONAL EXAMPLE I CAN SHARE THAT AS CEO OF THE UNITED STATES AIRFORCE. I FOUND THAT DESPITE SPENDING ALMOST TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR CYBER SECURITY. THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY AROUND SO I WAS ABLE TO EASILY PENETRATE OUR CYBER DEFENSES AND THEIR ANNUAL PENETRATION TEST. I KNEW THAT THE AIRFORCE HAD LOTS OF BRIGHT BRIGHT CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS AND ALMOST EVERY SECURITY TOOL IN EXISTENCE. YOUR OVERALL SECURITY POSTURE WAS EMBARRASSINGLY WEAK. I ASKED THEM TO SAY WHERE SHOULD I START THE ADVICE THEY PROVIDED WAS START WITH STRENGTHENING DEFENSES AGAINST THE MOST COMMON ATTACK PATTERNS. WE DID THIS OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE RESULT WAS MUCH IMPROVED SECURITY. BETTER OPERATIONAL SYSTEM AVAILABILITY AND SURPRISINGLY LOWER **** THIS IS WHAT I AM REFERRED TO AS A NO BRAINER. C. I. **** DEVELOPED A BEST PRACTICE THAT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IS THE WAY TO AVOID COSTLY DISJOINTED AND INEFFECTIVE CYBERSECURITY EFFORTS. IN ESSENCE THIS BEST PRACTICE IS THE ANSWER TO WHERE TO START. WORKING WITH THE SORT OF GLOBAL COLLABORATORS LEVERAGING THREAT DATA FROM U. S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY STATE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND MANY PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS. CIOS HAS DEVELOPED WHAT WE CALL A CENTRAL CYBER HYGIENE. SORT OF A RELATIVELY SMALL SET OF SECURITY BEST PRACTICES OR SAFEGUARDS. AND WE RECOMMEND EVERY ORGANIZATION IMPLEMENT TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE MOST COMMON CYBER ATTACK PATTERNS. PERCENT OF FIFTY SIX SAFEGUARDS THAT COMPRISES CENTRAL CYBER HYGIENE OR CONCRETE ACTIONS WITH MEASURABLE COMPLETION CRITERIA THAT ADDRESS THE ROOT ISSUES ACCOUNT FOR THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF SUCCESSFUL CYBER ATTACKS. ASCENTIAL CYBER HYGIENE CAN PREVENT THE MOST SIDE CORRECT MOST CYBER ATTACKS. CERTAINLY CONSIST MOSTLY OF GOOD SYSTEMS AND NETWORK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES NOT COSTLY TOOLS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT REVELATION. G. R. YES RECENTLY DEVELOPED AND PUBLISHED THE RESULTS OF A RIGOROUS ANALYTICAL EFFORT TO DOCUMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ESSENTIAL CYBER HYGIENE. THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT ESSENTIAL CYBER HYGIENE SAFEGUARDS WERE EFFECTIVE IN DEFENDING AGAINST SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE TOP CYBERATTACK TRIBES INCLUDING RANSOMWARE MALWARE AND INSIDER PRIVILEGE MISUSE. IMPLEMENTING A CENTRAL CYBER HYGIENE FOR ALL ORGANIZATIONS MAKE SENSE AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE CONSIDER MANDATING IT ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIRD I WANT TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE RECENT STUDY ON THE NECESSITY OF STRONG GOVERNANCE TO EMPLOYMENT AND ACCELERATE THE EXPANSION AFFECTED STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY. A YEAR AGO THE CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY WORKING WITH UNIVERSITY OF ALBANY CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY AND GOVERNMENT. THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION AND THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATORS. PUBLISHED THE RESULTS OF A STUDY EXAMINING HOW EFFECTIVE CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE WITHIN STAGE CORRELATED TO IMPROVE CYBERSECURITY RESILIENCE. THE TITLE OF THE STUDY REPORT IS MANAGING CYBER THREATS THROUGH EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE A CALL TO ACTION FOR GOVERNORS AND STATE LEGISLATURES COPY THE REPORT HAS BEEN PROVIDED AS PART OF THE HEARING CORPORATION INSURANCE. THE STUDY INTERVIEWED DOZENS OF STATE OFFICIALS CIO'S SEE I ALSO AS WELL AS EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCH LEADERS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT EFFECTIVE CYBER GOVERNANCE WAS A PREREQUISITE FOR EFFECTIVE CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM WITHIN THE STATE. BY MAKING FINDINGS OF THE STUDY WERE THE FOLLOWING. FIRST A FEW STATES HAVE CYBER SECURITY GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVELY ENSURES THAT THEIR CYBER RISK IS MANAGED TO A LEVEL AND IN WAYS THAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED THROUGH GOVERNANCE PROCESS SEES AS ACCEPTABLE TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE. SECOND IF YOU COMMONLY AGREED INDICATORS OR METRICS SUGGEST TO DISCUSS CYBERSECURITY OPERATIONS WITHIN THE STATE AND THOSE THAT DO EXIST ARE USED INTERMITTENTLY. FINALLY THERE WAS CLEAR RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO EXPAND GOVERNANCE BEYOND STATE LEVEL AGENCY ASSETS TO WHAT WE CALL A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE THAT ENGAGES STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS AND LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. IN A COORDINATED AND COLLABORATIVE PROCESS OF CYBER RISK MANAGE. THE STUDY IDENTIFIED FOR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GOVERNORS AND STATE LEGISLATURES. FIRST ESTABLISHED OF THE WORDS THROUGH BOTH EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND LEGISLATION WE FOUND THAT A STRONG GOVERNOR EXECUTIVE LEADER IS VERY VALUABLE PERHAPS ESSENTIAL. IMPROVING CYBER SECURITY ACROSS THE STATE IS NOT A ONE OR TWO TERM AFTER LEGISLATION IS NEEDED TO CODIFY AND FORMALIZE THE NECESSARY GOVERNANCE PROCESS. SECOND FORMALIZE KEY PROCESS SIX APPLES ARE NUMBER STANDARDS FOR CONDUCTING RISK ASSESSMENTS LEVERAGING CONTROLS OVERIT PROCUREMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS AND ESTABLISHING ENFORCING STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY ARCHITECTURES. THIRD CLEARLY ASSIGNED ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES- HAS ACCOUNTABILITY CERTAINLY THE COMMENSURATE AUTHORITY. AND FOURTH MONITOR INDICATORS FOR DECISION MAKERS THE STUDY IDENTIFIED SIXTEEN INDICATORS AND METRICS THAT ALL GOVERNORS AND STATE LEGISLATORS SUCH PLANTATIONS FOR ASSESSING THE STATE OF CYBERSECURITY ACROSS THEIR STATE. DURING A STUDY WE FOUND THAT STATE SENATE IMPLEMENTED THE CORE RECOMMENDATION RECOMMENDED ACTIONS AND MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN IMPROVING STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY. LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THAT I HAVE REVIEWED YOUR BIOGRAPHIES AND I REALIZED THAT NONE OF YOU ARE CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS IN THAT CYBER SECURITY IS A VERY COMPLEX VERY. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CUT THROUGH THE FOG OF MORE. AND KEEP YOUR ACTIONS SIMPLE AND FOCUSED. TO SUMMARIZE OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS FOR ESSENTIAL CYBER HYGIENE FOR ALL SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS WHY. THIS IS NOT THE FINAL STEP BUT IT IS ACHIEVABLE BY ALMOST ANY ORGANIZATION AND THE DESTRUCTIVE INCREMENTING ABOUT ATTACKS. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER A SIMILAR APPROACH TO LEGISLATION PASSED IN OHIO UTAH AND CONNECTICUT. WHICH PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE CYBERSECURITY SAFEGUARDS LIKE ESSENTIAL CYBER HYGIENE. SECOND WE WOULD RECOMMEND A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO ESTABLISH STATEWIDE CYBER GOVERNANCE. OUR STUDY PROVIDES A SOLID OUTLINE FOR HOW TO GET STARTED. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MR DOING. OUR LAST PRESENTER TODAY BEST BEST AND KRIEGER ATTORNEYS AT LAW AND CO CHAIR OF B. B. K.'S NEW PRIVACY AND CYBERSECURITY PRACTICE GROUP- WELCOME IS HOCKEY PROPERTY WE LOOK FOR THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND TO SERVE ON THIS PANEL TODAY- OUR FIRM SERVICE PUBLIC AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND I HAVE- WORKS IN THE AREA OF DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY- PROBABLY THIRTY YEARS HAVING WORK DONE AND- I STATE HEALTH AGENCIES SO I COME FROM. A LITTLE BIT OF OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE IN THESE SSUES. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY ARE THE CHALLENGES FACING LOCAL AGENCIES I'D LIKE TO GET A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY ATTACKS ON LOCAL AGENCIES. AND PROVIDE A FEW ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS WITH REGARDS TO- EFFORTS TO ENSURE- IMPROVE CYBER SECURITY ACROSS THE STATE. TELL S. REFLECTED IN THE DISCUSSIONS OF MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES THE CYBER SECURITY ENVIRONMENT IS EVOLVING AND HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY HOSTILE AND INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. AND ON THE LEVEL OF THREAT IS NOT FULLY RECOGNIZED. BY MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. BUT CHALLENGES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE IT CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS HOSPITAL DISTRICT'S EDUCATIONAL DISTRICTS ARE OTHERS. OFTEN HAVE TO DO WITH A LACK LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERTISE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW- AND A LACK OF RESOURCES DEDICATED TO THEIR IT INFRASTRUCTURE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES- ARE OFTEN OPERATING WITH OUTDATED EQUIPMENT SERVERS COMPUTERS AND SOFTWARE MAKING THEM HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO CYBER SECURITY ATTACKS AND IN ADDITION AS NOTED THERE IS A KNOWLEDGE GAP AND I NEED TO BRING SPECIALIZED CYBERSECURITY RESOURCES TO BEAR. ANOTHER MENTIONED EARLIER IS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES MAY BE UNDER INSURED AGAINST CYBER RISKS. ACCORDING TO- AS SURVEYED BY A RANSOMWARE PROTECTION UNDER THE PUBLIC SECTOR LAGS BEHIND OTHER IN THE PERCENTAGE OF ENTITIES THAT CARRY CYBER INSURANCE AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ENTITIES THAT CARRY RANSOMWARE COVERAGE WITH ONLY ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. HI KAREN RANSOMWARE COVERAGE. THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF CYBER SECURITY INCIDENT AND THAT IS BEFORE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LOST PRODUCTIVITY RESULTING FROM A RANSOMWARE ATTACK WHICH IN SEVERAL CASES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAND- DISABLE THE CITY'S INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FORTY SIX WEEKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NOW IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS DEFINED THE CONCEPT RECOVERY FROM THEIR OWN BUDGET THAT CHALLENGE CAN BECOME INSURMOUNTABLE IN PARTICULAR FOR SMALLER MUNICIPALITIES OR COUNTIES. THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN CYBER INSURANCE IS BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT- PREMIUMS ARE INCREASING- THERE ARE REPORTS INCREASED BY 25% TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ARE EXPECTED TO RISE FURTHER AND AS NOTED EARLIER INSURERS ARE REVIEWING THE SECURITY PROFILES OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY ENSURE AN EVENTUALLY- ENTITIES WITH AN ADEQUATE SECURITY SIMPLY WILL NOT BE INSURABLE. I GUESS THAT CONTEXT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ARE INCREASINGLY BECOMING TARGETS OF ATTACKS- ALTHOUGH- BRICKWORKS VERY ACCORDING TO- SELF ALWAYS AROUND MORE PROTECTION BENDER- RANSOMWARE ATTACKS HAVE INCREASED CLOSE 25100% SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND- DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE YOU USE. NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES- REPORTS HUNDREDS SEVENTY ATTACKS OTHER REPORTS ON. FORD TYPE READ- IDENTIFY FOUR HUNDRED ATTACKS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN ALONG SH SOME OF THESE ATTACKS CAN HAVE WIDE RANGING IMPLICATIONS- AND LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY AND I KNOW THAT THERE- TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS NOT A DATA BREACH MANY CYBER SECURITY ATTACKS ARE NOT REPORTED. BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAW THAT CURRENTLY REQUIRES THEM TO BE RECORDED- THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO SEPARATE TAX IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE PUBLIC SAFETY GOVERNMENT MEDICAL AND EDUCATION SECTORS SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA- THERE WERE THIRTY EIGHT ATTACKS REPORTED I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IT SOME EXAMPLES OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE ATTACKS. IN SOME CASES THERE WERE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS THAT INTRODUCE MALICIOUS SOFTWARE THAT ENCRYPTED OR INFECTED ALL OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS. I'M A WAS REPORTED SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT TRUCK HE WAS THE VICTIM OF RANSOMWARE ATTACK THAT INFECTED AFFECTED THE FULL SCOPE. OF CITY SERVICES- COMPUTERS WERE INFECTED EMPLOYEES HAD TO BE OUTFITTED WITH NEW COMPUTERS AND HOT SPOTS FOR INTERNET ACCESS. AND THE TOWN LOST ALL OF ITS ARCHIVED EMAILS. IN OTHER CASES THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO STEAL PUBLIC FUNDS ON JULY SIX TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WAS REPORTED THAT AT SEBASTOPOL WIRE TRANSFER INVOLVING SONOMA COUNTY'S TREASURY OFFICE TURNED OUT TO BE A SCAM. THAT BILKED SEBASTOPOL OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION AND PROPERTY TAXES. THAT THAT WAS COMMITTED VIA FRAUDULENT EMAIL. REQUESTING A TRANSFER FROM- COOL- STRESSFUL SOMETIMES HELD BY THE AUDITOR CONTROLLER TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR. IN OTHER CASES- THERE ARE THREATS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN STOLEN AND THE RANSOMWARE ATTACKERS THREATENED TO RELEASE THAT AIR FRANCE A MISTIMED HATE POLICE DEPARTMENT FILES AND ALSO HOSPITALS ARE OFTEN SUBJECT IF THESE TYPES OF ATTACKS. SO IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WAS REPORTED THAT A SENSE OF PLACE SUFFERED A RANSOMWARE ATTACKS. AND TO SEE IT CREDIT TAX- ANNOUNCED THAT IT COPIED HUGE AMOUNTS OF DATA AND WOULD RELEASE IT ON THE DARK WEB. AS SOON AS THEY DID NOT PAY THE RANSOMWARE- WHICH WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS- WHEN THE RANSOMWARE DEADLINE PASSED THE HACKERS PLACED SEVEN GIGABYTES OF. DATA ONLINE AND THESE WERE POLICE DEPARTMENT RECORDS INCLUDING RECORDINGS WITNESS INTERVIEWS I GAIN DATABASE AN ARREST REPORT. AN OFFICE TABLE DATA. I'M IN ADDITION HAS BEEN MENTIONED AND THIS AND- CREDIT HACKERS ARE INCREASED TO. IS SERVICES- I'M JANUARY FIFTEENTH TWO TWENTY WAS REPORTED A HACKER TRIED TO POISON THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT THAT SERVES- PARTS OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. BACKER HAD THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD FOR A FORMER EMPLOYEES TEAMVIEWER ACCOUNT ACCORDING TO A PRIVATE REPORT COMPILED BY THE- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL INTENT- INTELLIGENCE CENTER IN FEBRUARY. AND SEEN BY THE N. B. C. NEWS. AFTER LOGGING IN ACTORS DELETED PROGRAMS THAT THE WATER PLANT USED TO TREAT DRINKING WATER. SO I'M WORKING WITH LOCAL ENTITIES BUT I SEE IS FINDS THAT AN ENTITY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO ATTACK IT TYPICALLY WILL ACT TO ENHANCE IT HARD IN ITS IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY PRACTICES AND TO INVEST. IN IT RESOURCES HOWEVER THE BETTER APPROACH IS TO TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT SUCH ATTACKS PROACTIVELY THROUGH BEST PRACTICES WHICH INCLUDE ASSESSING CYBERSECURITY REST ROBUST SECURITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF PERSONNEL CYBER SECURITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES BACKUP AND DISASTER RECOVERY IS CRITICAL VENDOR MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL AND INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANNING AND- TESTING. ARE ALL CRITICAL RESPONSE ELEMENTS OF CYBER SECURITY PREPAREDNESS. IN ADDITION AND CUTE CAT THIRD PARTY AUDITS OR ASSESSMENTS TO EVALUATE THE SECURITY SYSTEMS AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND- AS NOTED THERE'S OFTEN A NEED TO SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADE. EQUIPMENT AND RESTARTS. SO IN I STAYED. CAN A US AFTERWARDS- ANSWER TO BETTER COORDINATE DEVELOP L. T. INFORMATION AND RESOURCES- AND A NUMBER OF WAYS ONE OF WHICH IS BY FILLING RESOURCE GAPS NOT MET BY FEDERAL INITIATIVES AND- AS WE KNOW THERE RECENTLY THE CYBER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT GRANT RESOURCES FOR CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS- ON AN EVALUATION OF HOW THE STATES CAN SUPPLEMENTS OR- BEST UTILIZE THAT. IS IMPORTANT PROVIDING STANDARDS FOR LOCAL ENTITIES THAT WILL ENSURE THEY ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE AND PERHAPS PROVIDING EDUCATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL ON TO- ASSIST. M. AND UTILIZING THESE RESOURCES. LOOKING AT THE AVAILABILITY OF CYBER INSURANCE ARE SOME OTHER TYPE OF RESTFUL FOR COVERAGE OF SECURITY INCIDENTS WHICH CANNOT ALWAYS BE PREVENTED. I'M OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED TO ME- IS TO ENSURE THAT ARE UNIQUE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ARE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE CLEAR EXTENSIONS FROM PUBLIC REPORTING OF ANY I. T. SOFTWARE SECURITY INFORMATION- AND ALSO TO CLARIFY. LABOUR'S LOST SUCH AS AB FIVE AMENDED BY AB. TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN AS IT RELATES TO I. T. SERVICES TO ENSURE THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTRACT OUT FOR I. T. SERVICES. THERE ARE CERTAINLY- I NUMBER EXTINF EXAMPLES OF WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING TO- EMPLOYMENT TRAINING AT. AND SUPPORTING PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES FOR CYBER SECURITY EDUCATION AND APPROPRIATIONS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO- PRESENT MY THOUGHTS AT THIS HEARING. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS HOPSON- SO BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NUMBERS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I WANTED TO AGAIN INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IN NOW PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER. EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE FIVE FOUR NINE ZERO. WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE ACCESS CODE. SEVEN ONE SIX TWO THREE FIVE THREE. WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS DO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CENTER NUMBER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I SUPPOSE I SHOULD NOTE AND CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU- MISTER CHAIR THAT- WHILE WE'RE HERE JUST A FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES AGO I SEE- ALERT SAYS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON MONDAY ANNOUNCED ARRESTS AND CHARGES AGAINST HACKERS ALLEGEDLY AFFILIATED WITH MAJOR RANSOMWARE ORGANIZATION. I ASSUME THAT'S A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PARTICULAR HEARING NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS I WANT TO THANK MR GILLIGAN AND WAS HAPPY FOR YOUR EXCELLENT PRESENTATION I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS AS TO. WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE FOR US TO IMPLEMENT HERE- AND THEN- BACK TO SOME QUESTIONS I ASKED THE PREVIOUS PANEL AS- TO- I. AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING HERE AND- TO PROTECT OUR OWN GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES LOCAL STATE THE IT SECTOR. BUT ALSO WHAT WHAT. SHOULD WE BE DOING- WITH RESPECT TO PROTECTING CONSUMERS. WHO MAY BE IMPACTED BY- INFORMATION THAT APPEARS TO BE- IT WAS LAST BEFORE APPEARS TO BE LEGITIMATE BUT IT IS NOT THAT DOES DO YOU BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING WE SHOULD BE DOING. TO SUGGEST OR REQUIRE THAT- PRIVATE ENTITIES PARTICULARLY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DO SOMETHING IN ADDITION TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW TO PROTECT THEIR CONSUMERS. WELL SENATOR THIS IS JOHN GILLIGAN LET ME LET ME START WITH. A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- I THINK THAT- AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY- SEVERAL STATES SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND PROVIDING LEGISLATION. THAT DEFINES EXPECTATIONS FOR ALL PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO BUSINESS WITHIN THE STATE WITH REGARD TO YOU KNOW I USE THE TERM ESSENTIAL CYBER HYGIENE. YEAH I WAS VERY VERY EACH OF THESE LAWS HAVE A SOMEWHAT BROADER DEFINITION BUT IT'S AN ABSENCE SORT OF BASIC- CYBER SECURITY CONTROLS ARE SAFEGUARDS. ARE HAND THE MOTIVATION THAT IS PROVIDED IN THE LEGISLATION IS IF IN FACT YOU IMPLEMENT THE SAFEGUARDS. IF THERE IS AN ARTIFACT OF AN ATTACK OR BREACH MAN- YOU WILL BE GIVEN SAFE HARBOR AND- AND- AND THE RESPONSE IN THE LAWSUITS THAT MAY ARISE FROM THAT. AND THAT BECOMES A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MOTIVATOR IN THE SHORT TERM. I THINK IN THE LONG TERM AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL I THINK THE US CYBER INSURANCE- COMMUNITY- CAN PROVIDE AN ENORMOUS MOTIVATOR- FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT I THINK AS WAS MENTIONED BY MR AMERICAN ARMY. THE INTO WE GET SOME BETTER DATA- IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT BUT I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM. LEGISLATION THAT- REINFORCES THE IMPORTANCE AND PROVIDES IT THIS POINT VOLUNTARY ADOPTION. OF. YOUR WORK WERE OUT OR SAFEGUARDS IS REALLY SORT OF A PRUDENT WAY TO GET THE BALL ROLLING SO TO SPEAK. R. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR JULIAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY AS WELL- BESIDES EAT ANYTHING ELSE YOU LIKE THAT. YES I AGREE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO ALIGN THE CYBER SECURITY STANDARDS WITH REQUIREMENTS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES TO INSURE. SO THAT LOCAL ENTITIES CAN IN FACT BE INSURE I THINK THERE IS- ALSO I NEED TO AND TO HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THERE ARE A LOT OF STANDARDS OUT THERE YES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND I I'M NOT. CLEAR THAT THEY'RE TRULY MAKING THEIR WAY DOWN TO LOCAL AGENCIES AND TO BEING IMPLEMENTED SO I THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR- A ROLE- STATE AGENCY AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND FOR AND ENCOURAGING- JOIN PURCHASING AND OTHER COLLABORATIONS BY BOTH. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND LOCAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE GOALS AND THIS PARTICULAR SPACE. AND YOUR SECOND QUESTION- I THINK THAT'S VERY INTERESTING I ACTUALLY HAVE RECENTLY SEEN SOME BANKS THAT DO HAVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS- ABOUT THEIR INFORMATION AND- PERSONALLY I. WHEN I REFINANCED THIS YEAR- I RECEIVED THE EMAILS FROM THREE DIFFERENT CLOSING COMPANIES RIGHT DID NOT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH ASKING ME TO CLICK ON IT BUT THEN AND- FINALIZE MY CLOSING DOCUMENTS. SO AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT ONE HAS TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND. I AM NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE HOW TO INCENTIVIZE SENT IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE- COMMITTEE AND THE AGENCY CAN LOOK AT WAYS TO BETTER EDUCATE. THE COMMUNITY ON- THE CYBER SECURITY RISKS I THINK THAT'S A VERY VALUABLE ROLE THANK YOU THANK YOU MUST HAVE BEEN BY THE WAY THAT'S AN EXCELLENT SEGUE TO OUR HEARING TOMORROW THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT TO. PRIVACY AND HOW IT WAS THAT WHEN YOU WERE- DEALING WITH ONE ENTITY YOU'VE GOT ADVERTISING FROM THREE OTHER ENTITIES- PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU WERE SHARING BERRY I WOULD ASSUME VERY PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION ANYWAY THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. SERVER TO SEE IF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY I JUST HAD A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THEM. SAFE HARBOR- QUESTION OR MAYBE THIS IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO. THE CARD I THINK THE COMMENTS MADE BY- MISTER GILLIGAN. YES I HEAR YOU AS FAR AS THAT HYGIENE AND I KEEP GETTING TOLD BY EVERYONE WHO KNOWS CYBERSECURITY THAT GOOD HYGIENE IS THE BEST WAY TO AVOID CYBER ATTACKS- BUT I WONDER FOR LOOKING AHEAD TEN YEARS IF THAT'S STILL GOING TO BE THE CASE AND I JUST BE INTERESTED IN EITHER YOUR THOUGHTS ARE BOTH YOUR THOUGHTS. ON THE QUESTION OF SORT OF WHAT WE'RE THE CYBER ATTACKS THE FUTURE GONNA COME FROM IN PARTICULAR I REMEMBER READING SOMETHING IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES NOT SO LONG AGO THAT JUST PORTENDED A LOT TO DO- CHINA HAD WON THE A. I. WAR I THINK IN A NUMBER OF UN NAMED- PENTAGON FOLKS AND SAID- AND- GIVEN THE INCREASING USE OF A. I. IN IN INCREASING SOPHISTICATED CYBER ATTACKS- YOU KNOW HOW HOW BIG A ROLE SECOND PLAY GOING FORWARD AND WHAT. CAN WE DO AGAINST AGAINST THOSE TYPES OF ATTACKS. SENATOR THANK YOU- LET ME YEAH MAYBE PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT THAT MAY HELP YOU- WHEN YOU TRYING TO MITIGATE AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS- WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT- THE ATTACKERS GO AGAINST THE EASIEST ROUTE- AND SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CYBER HYGIENE THIS IS SORT OF THE BASICS THE FOUNDATIONS AND SO I SENT ANOTHER WAY I'M SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY ON FANCY TOOLS AND TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS. IS USELESS IF IN FACT YOU HAVEN'T DONE THE BASICS BLOCKING AND TACKLING BECAUSE WHAT YOU FIND IS. THE BASIC BLOCKING AND TACKLING THE HYGIENE AS WE DISCUSSED. IS WHAT'S NECESSARY TO TAMP DOWN THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF ATTACKS AND IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU TAMP THEM DOWN BUT YOU CAN KIND OF LESSEN THE NOISE AND YOU CAN START TO FOCUS ON THE MORE SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS SO IT REALLY IS A- REVOLUTION. BUT YOU MUST START WITH HYGIENE IF YOU DON'T HAVE HYGIENE AS I SAID IT'S REALLY. NOT A GREAT VALUE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS BECAUSE IN MANY CASES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK AND IT'S A VERY NOISY ENVIRONMENT WITH ALL THE ATTACKS- I THINK. I DID I WOULD WANT TO HAVE ONE COMMENT TO ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE I THINK YOUR OBSERVATION ABOUT YOUR MANAGER IS A GOOD ONE- THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF- EFFORTS AND- AND YOU KNOW COMPANIES LIKE PALO ALTO AND OTHERS ARE INCREASINGLY USING. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BOTH TO HELP DEFEND- AND WE KNOW THAT ATTACKERS ARE STARTING TO BUT IT'S STILL A BIT EARLY ARE STARTING TO USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. ARE ON THE OFFENSIVE SIDE. AND SO I THIS IS AN AREA THAT. SERVED TO ME SORT OF INDICATES THAT WE GOTTA GET MOVING QUICKLY AND IN DOING THE BASICS OF BLOCKING AND TACKLING BECAUSE- AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ISSUES- IT WILL ADD BY THE ATTACKERS. IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THEM. AND I THINK ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AS COMPANIES- PALO ALTO FIRE RIGHT- CROWDSTRIKE CONSIDERING USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO PICK UP SOME OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS. THAT ARE NOT BEING PICKED UP BY WHAT I WOULD CALL BASIC CYBER HYGIENE SOFTWARE I'VE BEEN- CLEARING IN MY- MY RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION. NO EXCELLENT RESPONSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MR. GIVE ME THE ANSWER. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO IT IS GOING TO BECOME INCREASINGLY SPACE CAT IT AS FREE AS WE NOW ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE BOTH THE CYBER ATTACKERS AND ITS DEFENDERS- THERE WILL BE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INVOLVED IN. ON BOTH- FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND I THEREFORE IT'S CRITICAL I THINK TO PUT CENTER HYGIENE IN PLACE NOW BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FUTURE TEN YEARS FROM NOW OUR CITIES ARE GOING TO BE DIGITAL AND THE ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ATTACK AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF CYBER ATTACKS ARE GOING TO BE EVEN FAR MORE THAN WHAT WE SEE EACH DAY. SO I COMMEND. THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND- RESTING THE SISTER THANK YOU. FOR ONE LAST FROM YOU YOU MENTIONED CYBER INSURANCE AND CYBER SECURITY INSURANCE AS A KEY. CONDUIT TO TRYING TO GET A DIFFERENT ACTORS IN OUR VERY DIVERSE SOCIETY TO ADOPT WEATHER'S GOOD HYGIENE PRACTICES OR OTHER- YOU KNOW ACTUALLY BASED- PRACTICES AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS- AND I OTHER THAN DATA WHICH I THINK YOU BOTH MENTIONED ISN'T AS BEING IMPORTANT FOR DETERMINING THE RISKS HERE. WHAT ELSE CAN WE BE THINKING ABOUT AS FAR AS STANDING UP MORE CYBER SECURITY INSURANCE AND MAKING THIS MORE OF A UBIQUITOUS- THING. DAVID LET ME START AND- AND TRY TO UNPACK A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE SAY NEED MORE DATA WHAT DO WE NEED- SO IN FACT- MY ORGANIZATION CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY HAS HAD ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH RESILIENCE INSURERS- AND OTHERS. BUT AND OUR OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS HEARING. TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE. THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS ABLE TO OFFER DISCOUNTS FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT IMPLEMENT CERTAIN- SUCH CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES- WHEN WE SAY THERE'S NO DATA- THE CYBER SECURITY OR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS ALL ABOUT MANAGING RISK AND SO THEY ARE VERY WILLING. TO OFFER DISCOUNTS IF THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT DOING A. B. C. AND D. E. R. REDUCES RASK AND THEN WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO IS UNDERSTAND TO WHAT EXTENT. DOING YOU KNOW ABC INDY SO FOR EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTING CYBER HYGIENE THAT'S SORT OF BEEN THE DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD WITH RESILIENCE. WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF DISCOUNT SHOULD BE 10% 20% AT CENTER. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET THE DATA AND I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. YOU NOT ONLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT WAS- IMPLEMENTED BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE STATE OF THE SYSTEM. THAT WAS BREACHED- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DROP I'M VERY FINE GRAINED CORRELATION BETWEEN OKAY WAS THIS PARTICULAR SO AN ORGANIZATION MAY FOR EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTED CYBER HYGIENE IN EIGHTY PERCENT. BUT THEY MISSED 20% AND SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO WORK WITH IN PARTICULAR SINCE WE HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS IS. AS THEY ARE AND THEY HAVE A SUCCESSFUL ATTACK OR BREACH MAY PROVIDE US BASICALLY INFORMATION THAT DESCRIBES WHAT WAS THE STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT WHAT CYBER SECURITY SAFEGUARDS CONTROLS WERE IN PLACE- WHAT WAS THE- THE- THE- THE STATE OF THE SOFTWARE ETCETERA. AND THROUGH THAT ANALYSIS WORKING WITH THE INSURANCE. COMPANY WE THINK AND THE ROLE OF JIM FUTURE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO START TO PROVIDE STUDENTS. AND I. AS WAS MEANT BY MISS MAC- THE INSURANCE OR INSURANCE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW FOR CYBER SECURITY IS REALLY STRUGGLING BECAUSE- THE SPATE OF RANSOMWARE ATTACKS IS REALLY CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL DRAMATICALLY- THAT'LL SETTLE DOWN- BUT I THINK- HOPEFULLY WHEN WE GET THAT SETTLED DOWN WILL BE IN A POSITION WHERE. THE INSURANCE ORGANIZATIONS ONE WILL BE MOTIVATED- AND BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO. WHEN I WENT TO INSURANCE COMPANIES THEIR ANSWER WAS. YOU KNOW DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT OFFERING DISCOUNTS RIGHT NOW WE'RE SELLING SO MUCH CYBER SECURITY INSURANCE AND IT'S THE MOST PROFITABLE. PRODUCT WE HAVE- BUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO JEOPARDIZE IT BY PUTTING ANY ROADBLOCKS IN THE PROCESS WELL THE LAST YEAR AS YOU PROGRAM THE HEARING TODAY. THAT'S CHANGED DRAMATICALLY AND SO A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE GETTING OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE OF THE- THE REST BUT I THINK IS THAT SETTLES DOWN. I THINK WE'RE ON A PATH TO BEING ABLE TO GET TO THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO START TO OFFER DISCOUNTS. AND I AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POSITIVE MOTIVATORS TO GET- BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS TO MOVE FORWARD AGGRESSIVELY WITH SOME OF THE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. NEW CONSTRAINTS REGARDING LIKE THE HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING PROTOCOLS- TESTIMONY LIMITED TO ONE MINUTE EACH. SO LET'S BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE.
