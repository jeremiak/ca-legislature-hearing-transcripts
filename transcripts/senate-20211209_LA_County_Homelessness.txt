WHO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. OF 200-014-1516 SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT I SPEND THE NIGHT WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE DO THIS PANDEMIC. THE REASON WHY SPEND THE NIGHT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE- ONE THAT I UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE. I DON'T WANT JUST PASSED BY IT- ON A FREEWAY. LET'S SEE AN ACT LIKE IT DOESN'T EXIST I WANT TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TWO THOUSAND AND- NINETEEN AUTHOR BILL. MAKING CRIMES AGAINST HOMELESS PEOPLE HATE CRIME. WHY DID YOU DO THAT WELL I'M GLAD YOU ASKED PEOPLE LOOK AND TARGET PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS BECAUSE THEIR HOMELESS. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN THEY TARGET PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE HOMELESS JUST LIKE IF YOU TARGET SOMEONE BECAUSE YOU'RE ASIAN BECAUSE YOU'RE GAY BECAUSE THEY'RE JEWISH.

MY GOD SOME WILL WIND UP ON MY DOOR AT ANY MOMENT SO THIS SITUATION IS ABSOLUTELY REAL- HE'S SO FAR GONE HE. COULD EVEN WHEN I TOOK HIM TO A MOTEL AFTER. REACH OUT TO THE OF LOS ANGELES OPERATION KEY. BECAUSE HE WASN'T BACK. AND SO I PER HIM TO. A HE COULD NOT EVEN WRITE HIS NAME. HE COULD WRITE HIS NAME. AND BECAUSE HE SUFFERED TRAUMA. AS A CHILD LOSING BOTH THE MOTHER AND FATHER DUE TO AIDS. AND HIS BIOLOGICAL GRANDPARENTS TO NEVER NEVER GOT HIM THE CARD TO HELP AT SIX YEARS OLD AT SIX YEARS OLD THE TRAUMA THAT HE WAS FACED WITH CONTINUE TO SPILL OVER TO THE DAHLE LIFE AND NOW HE'S SOMEWHERE AGAIN. ON THE STREETS UNDER THE RAIN UNDER A BRIDGE SO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY I'M COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND IT WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. GERMAN SANTIAGO FOR CONVENING THIS IS A VERY. ALBERT'S THE CHANGE THAT IS OUT THERE. DOWNEY SUBURBAN COMMITTEE THAT THE LOOK FOR DIFFERENT MY DRY OVER THE HEARING I USED TO WORK IN THE TOKYO AND SO. HOW MUCH WORSE. THE CRISIS THE HOMELESS CRISIS CONTINUES TO GET THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT JUST A CITY OF LOS ANGELES PROBLEM. I'M GONNA BE FOLLOWING MISTER GIBSON'S LEAD IN TERMS OF SPENDING A NIGHT IN A HOMELESS SHELTER WHEN A TORRANCE BILLS ITS FIRST TINY HOME SHELTER. TO BRING HOME THE POINT THAT HOMELESSNESS IS EVERYWHERE IT'S NOT JUST. AND OUR URBAN CORE BUT IT'S IN OUR SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES IT'S EVERYWHERE AND SO I'M HERE. TO ADD TO THE SENSE OF URGENCY. TO GET PEOPLE OFF OUR STREETS OF OUR SIDEWALKS INTO SHELTER AND TO HOUSING. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN AND. HAS IT THAT THE START BUT BUT I WILL AND- OF COURSE YOU CAN TAKE OFF YOUR MASK WENT WHEN YOU FEEL NEEDED WE ARE OUTDOORS- MONIES BECAUSE ON THE- I REPRESENT THE FIFTY THIRD ASSEMBLY DISTRICT- PROBABLY- THE EPICENTER OF HOMELESSNESS- HERE IN THE STATES AND PROBABLY THE COUNTRY. AND THIS ISN'T A PROBLEM THAT JUST BEGAN ONE DAY THIS IS BEEN DECADES AND DECADES OF POLICIES. ARE MEANT TO DO WELL BUT QUITE FRANKLY DIDN'T LIVE UP TO EXPECTATION- SOME MIGHT SAY AND- I WOULD ARGUE IN SOME CASES FAILED. BECAUSE THE PART OF THE HOMELESS POPULATIONS CONTINUE TO GROW- PART OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO TODAY I THINK YOU ARE COLLEAGUES WANTED TWO DAYS TALK ABOUT WHAT WORKED AND WHAT HASN'T WORKED IN NOT SUGAR COATING IT. BOTH ON THE STATE SIDE. FEDERAL AND LOCAL. A. N. ONE OF THESE UP WANT TO KIND OF PERCENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS IS WE CAN'T. CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS- I THINK THERE'S OFTEN A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. ROB LINGER POINTING WE'RE NOT SAYING- THIS AND HE DID THIS THIS AND HE DID THAT BUT THAT IT TOOK JOINT RESPONSIBILITY WHERE IT'S AN ALL HANDS ON DECK EMERGENCY THAT WE'VE GOT TO. WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS- YESTERDAY- THIS LIKE COMMITTEE WAS SET UP A FOR A COUPLE YEARS AGO YEARS AGO. OF THE LAST MEETING WE HAD IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. PROPOSED A NUMBER OF PUBLIC POLICY- THE PLAN PROPOSALS THAT WE THEN IMPLEMENTED.OVER THE NEX YEAR NOW KOBE HIT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET IS THE FIRST TIME WE MET. AND WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO AT LEAST POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT THEN WERE IMPLEMENTED THAT. ARE NOW ON PAR LAWSUIT WE'RE NOT JUST MEETING FOR THE SAKE OF MEETING FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING THINGS WE USE. WE DOUBLE DOWN- WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT INVESTMENTS- AND NOW WE LOOK AT THE STATE INVESTING TWELVE BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. AT SIX BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND THAT'S JUST THE START- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INVESTMENTS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THEN ABOUT HAVING EIGHT EIGHT A REVENUE STREAM AND WE DID THAT. AND IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HAD HAD A BILLION TO OVER BILLION DOLLARS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY COULD BE HIT BUT WE STILL INVESTED IN THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW MORE INNOVATIVE WORK LIKE HOME KEY ROOM KEY- IN IN TWENTY WE FOUGHT VERY HARD EVERYBODY HERE AND WE'VE GOT. A UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN HOMELESSNESS. BUT BUT BUT I MEAN LET'S LET'S BE VERY HONEST ABOUT IT WE STILL SAW AN EXPLOSION HOMELESSNESS. I WE SAW- IN TWENTY TWENTY APPOINTING COUNTY SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE. A LAND ON THE STREETS OF FORTY ONE THOUSAND IN L. A. COUNTY- A- IT'S SIXTY SIX THOUSAND IN A CITY IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THAT WAS EIGHT ALMOST I'M SING ROUND NUMBERS ALL DAY TODAY SO MAYBEWE WANT TO PAY ME TO A EXACT NUMBER- NO WE'RE NOT DOING THAT- IS. ABOUT 13% INCREASE IN THE COUNTY AND ABOUT ASK ANY RESIDENT ANY STAKEHOLDER IN THE REGION. IF THEY BELIEVE THAT HOMELESSNESS HAS HAD A DRINK OR ANY SORT OF IMPROVEMENT A SAW OR SO OR WE BEGUN TO SOLVE IT. ARE THEY WOULD THEY WOULD THEY WOULD THINK WE'RE DOING. SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST DRINKING THAT WERE DELUSIONAL. HOMELESSNESS HAS GOTTEN WORSE FOR THE QUICK SOCIAL RASKIN TODAY IS. A IS WE CAN'T CONTINUE DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT. AND I DON'T THINK ANY RESIDENT WHAT WOULD IT IN ANY POLL WOULD SHOW. UP POLL OR ANY RESIDENT WALKING DOWN THE STREET OR ANY STAKEHOLDER. THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE IT TO GET. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DONE ON UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT. SO WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS WHETHER MORE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TINY HOMES TODAY- WE'VE GOT REPORTS ABOUT ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE TODAY- WE GOT SERVICE PROVIDERS WE'VE GOT A GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND IN FACT THE CITY COMPTROLLER DID A REPORT. A COUPLE YEARS AGO OR A YEAR AGO HILL CORRECT ME WHEN IT WAS THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN REALLY HURT AND SO WE INVITED HIM TODAY TO HAVE THAT HURT SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT FINGERPOINTING WE'RE LOOKING AT A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT IT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THAT THE CURRENT SOLUTION TO NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND WE'VE GOT TO BE INNOVATIVE AND WHERE THE STATE HAS NOT STEPPED UP TO ITS EXPECTATIONS SAY IT OKAY WELL GROWN ADULTSHERE WE WANT TO IMPROVE THINGS BUT WHERE THERE ARE OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE ALSO NOT STEPPED UP WE SHOULD SAY THAT TOO BECAUSE THE HOMELESS POPULATION HAS GROWN NOT DECREASED. THE FOCUS TODAY. REALLY IS ABOUT HOUSING. AND SHELTER AND ROOF OVER THE HEAD. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE FOCUS IS TODAY SO WE WE'RE NOT GONNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME A MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES- BECAUSE WE WANTED TO DO THAT AND COME BACK LATER DIFFERENT DAY AND TALK ABOUT. A MENTAL HEALTH CARE WHAT WE LEARNED IN THE LAST COMMITTEE HEARING THAT WE HAD- THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME. IN DIFFERENT AREAS WE WANT TO FOCUS TODAY ON TO SHELTER OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS. NOW ORIGINALLY WE WANTED TO DO THIS OUTSIDE. WE STUCK TO OUR GUNS AND DID OUTSIDE BECAUSE YOU COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU WERE A WHOLE. AND MY WIFE I SPENT THE NIGHT A COUPLE DIFFERENT PLACES. AS WELL BUT BUT BUT- BUT YOU CERTAINLY WERE THE LEAD IN MAKING. THAT CHANGE NUMBER TELLS IT WE GOTTA GO OUT THERE EXPERIENCE A NIGHT ON THE STREET. OR WE WON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK ABOUT IT. NOW I WOULD I WOULD SAY THOUGH IS- WE DID OUTSIDE BACK TO MY ORIGINAL POINT. IS BECAUSE COULD YOU IMAGINE. I MEAN FOR SOME OF US ARE ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY OUT HERE FOR A COUPLE HOURS DURING HEARING. AND THE SET UP INFRASTRUCTURE DO THIS. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF THIS WAS YOUR LIFE. DAY IN DAY OUT. THIS IS AN ABOUT THREE FOUR HOURS THE CONVENIENCE OUTSIDE. IF YOU WALK OUTSIDE HERE ALL OVER LOS ANGELES CITY ALL OVER L. A. COUNTY. IS TEN CITIES EVERYWHERE WE CAN'T SUGAR COAT THAT. CAN'T TEN CITIES EVERYWHERE PEOPLE LIVING IN A N. N. INTENSE PEOPLE LIVING ON THE CARDBOARD BOXES PEOPLE LIVING UNDER WOULD SHIFT- MAKE HOME HOUSES- PEOPLE LIVING UNDER OFFRAMP ALL ACROSS THE COUNTY ALL ACROSS THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THIS PART AND WE SEE THAT ALL RIGHT IT CAN GO ON ON THE LIST OF THINGS. SO THIS IS JUST A MINOR INCONVENIENCE OF A COUPLE OF HOURS. BUT IF THIS WAS YOUR REALITY. FOR YEARS. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF THERE WAS A SENSE OF URGENCY TO GETTING THE WORK DONE. SO I HOPE THIS INSTILLS A SENSE OF URGENCY WILL TALK ABOUT SIMPLE TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE'S A POLL THAT REVEALED. THAT 95% OF THE VOTERS THOUGHT HOMELESSNESS WAS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AND THAT THEY WERE ANGRY FRUSTRATED OVERWHELMED. TODAY WE INVITE SOMEBODY TO WALK THROUGH A POLL THAT JUST SHOWS THAT THE PART OF THAT THE FRUSTRATION OF THE PROBLEMS GOT WORSE- IN OUR RESIDENTS SIZE. AND IT NOW IT REELS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE YOUR STATE OR LOCAL A REPRESENTATIVE THEY DON'T SEE A DIFFERENCE ANYMORE OR WHERE OR WHAT YOU REPRESENT WE'RE ALL PART OF THE PROBLEM AND WE'LL FIX IT I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE THE SENATE. FOUND A BOTTOM OUT HOW TO PUT US OUT BOTTOM LINE SO WE'RE DONE WITH EXCUSES IT ALSO REVEALS THAT PEOPLE WANT FASTER ACTION AND FOCUSED ON SHORT TERM WE WERE HERE LAST TIME I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE CASE TODAY PEOPLE ARE SAYING EMERGENCY SHELTERS. TINY HOMES WHATEVER IT IS GONNA GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS GONNA PUSH SHELTER OVER THEM THAT'S IT N. N. AND I WANT. IT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF INSANITY RIGHT CAN'T KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT. BUT BUT I WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M GRATEFUL FOR EVERYBODY WHO HAS COME ON BOARD TO DATE THAT- THE HELP. AND IN THE HAVE A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION SO THAT WE GET TO A PLACE- WE'RE HAVING THESE. THESE POSITIVE RESULTS- THAT IS HUMANE FOR THE PEOPLE LIVE ON THE STREET. OUR AIR AND IT BEGINS TO SATISFY OUR STUD EVERYONE'S HERE COLLECTIVE SENSE OF URGENCY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS- WITH A COUPLE A COUPLE PANELS THE FIRST ONE WILL TALK ABOUT- THE COST OF INVESTING IN HOMELESSNESS HOUSING. AND HOW MUCH WE BUILT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN THE REGION- WHAT THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT- THE PARTY AS WELL. ALL IN THE SECOND- WE ALSO WANT A SECOND SET OF PANELS THAT THE SECOND THIRD PANEL- IT'S- COME FROM THE PROVIDER PERSPECTIVE OF PROVIDING. HOUSING AND FOR OUR HOUSE NEIGHBORS. WHAT WORKED WHAT HASN'T THAT'S BROKEN UP INTO DIFFERENT PANELS. FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE AND FROM A SERVICE BUT PROVIDER PERSPECTIVE. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ONE MORE TIME- WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER IT'S NOT A FINGER POINTING SESSION. BUT IT'S ABOUT HAVING AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE GOOD THE AT THAT THE BAD THE UGLY WHAT WORKED AND WHAT HASN'T- AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN- OUR PANEL AND- I'D LIKE TO INVITE FIRST IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THE MISTER CONTROLLER- TO COME IN PERCENT I'M GONNA TAKE A LOT OF GUIDANCE- FROM- FROM FOLKS BEHIND ME AS WELL- BUT IF YOU LIKE THE PRESENT WE WOULD BE. EXTREMELY GRATEFUL AGAIN WE DID THIS OUTSIDE NOT FOR A SESSION OF INCONVENIENCE BUT COULD YOU IMAGINE. IF THIS WAS YOUR LIFE. BUT ACCEPTABLE. MISTER CONTROLLER DAHLE YEARS. IN A PRESS IT ONCE AND I'M GONNA TIME EVERYBODY TO FIVE MINUTES JUST TO THAT WERE AROUND COMFORTABLY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER WITH MY- MANNERS- AMISS AND WHO WOULD YOU ALSO- SIT DOWN I APOLOGIZE. I SKIPPED A LITTLE BIT OF THE INTRODUCTIONS BUT I'M HOPING THAT YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF- JUSTIN IN THIS IN THIS TO GET THE PROGRAM MOVING. MISTRUST MISSIVES A THIRD OF ALL PLEASE AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M SORRY JOB RIGHT INTO IT THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO INTO EACH OF THE- LEGISLATORS WHO ARE HERE AS WELL AS EVERYBODY ELSE IS ATTENDING THIS HEARING BOTH. HERE AND VIRTUALLY. AND IN MANY WAYS IT SEEMS SO APPROPRIATE AS YOU MENTIONED ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT WE ARE OUTDOORS AND WE ARE IN A TENT ON A RAINY DAY. AND IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE FOR THE MANY MANY THOUSANDS WHO EXPERIENCE THAT EACH AND EVERY SINGLE DAY. OF HOMELESSNESS IS REALLY THE EXISTENTIALIST CRISIS OF OUR TIME IN LOS ANGELES IT'S HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IT'S A MORAL CRISIS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. A COMMUNITY SAFETY CRISIS AND IT'S ALSO CRISIS THAT I BELIEVE THREATENS THE VERY DESIRABILITY OF LOS ANGELES AS A PLACE TO LIVE TO VISIT TO DO BUSINESS. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF UNSHELTERED PEOPLE LIVING ON OUR STREETS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FIFTEEN HUNDRED ON HEALTH ELLIE RESIDENTS DIED ON OUR STREETS. THAT'S BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR PEOPLE A DAY. IT'S UTTERLY UNCONSCIONABLE AND IT'S TRAGIC AND IT'S LARGELY PREVENTABLE. I IN MY OFFICE HAVE DEDICATED SIGNIFICANT TIME TO ANALYZING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE CITY BAILEY'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS. AND WHAT I WANT TO ADDRESS NOTABLY IS THE ONGOING AUDITS AND REVIEWS THAT WE'VE DONE OF TRIPLE H. ON THERE OF COURSE MANY REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS BUT HOUSING IS KEY. AND A FOCUS OF THE CITY'S EFFORTS TO ALLEVIATE HOMELESSNESS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TRIPLE H. THIS IS THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR VOTER APPROVED TAX PAYER. BOND MEASURE FROM TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THE PROMISE TO RESULT IN UP TO TEN THOUSAND UNITS APARTMENT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AS OF TODAY WE HAVE JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND OF THESE UNITS COMPLETED- I FIRST LOOK AT TRIPLE H. PROJECT IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND RECOMMENDING REALLOCATING FUNDS. TO WHAT I BELIEVE WE'RE LOWER COST PROJECTS TO STREAMLINING PERMITTING AND ALSO OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO GET MORE PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS MORE QUICKLY. BECAUSE IT'S TAKING WAY TOO LONG AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME DETAILS OF WHAT THAT IS ABOUT. NOW LAST MONTH THE CITY ISSUED TWO HUNDRED AND TWO WELL OF MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW TRIPLE H. DEPT OF THE PREVIOUS ISSUANCE WAS ALL THE WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. WE HAD ACTUALLY. ISSUED UP UNTIL JUST LAST MONTH ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN BOND CAPACITY. NOW WE'VE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION. BUT HE THE ORIGINAL THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION FORTY FOUR MILLION REMAINS UNSPENT AND OF COURSE NONE OF THE- RECENT TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE HAS BEEN SPENT YET. AS OF NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ONLY SEVENTEEN OF ONE HUNDRED AND TEN PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED I REGRET TO SAY DESPITE A LOT OF GREAT EFFORTS FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. BUT IT'S A PROCESS THAT IS BEEN FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS- JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND BOND FUNDED UNITS ARE ACTUALLY IN SERVICE. OF WORLD TOLD THAT THERE WILL BE SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SOME UNITS ARE TRANSLATING INTO ABOUT EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED BEDS. NOW THERE'S ALSO INNOVATION CHALLENGE PROJECTS THAT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS SET ASIDE. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE FIFTEEN PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE THESE WERE THE ONES THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO GET DONE QUICKLY. BUT ACTUALLY NONE ARE COMPLETED AND TWO ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION- OF THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ALSO THIS FORTY SEVEN MILLION THAT'S BEEN SPENT FOR FACILITY PROJECTS. AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THE HOUSING IS TAKING FOUR TO SIX YEARS TO BUID. NOW ALL THE CITIES PAYING ABOUT AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH TRIPLE H. UNIT. UP AND WHILE THE UNITS WERE SUPPOSED TO COST BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND. THE AVERAGE IS NOW AT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR THAT'S ROUGHLY THE SAME AS PURCHASING A NEW SINGLE FAMILY. AT A RATHER A NEW CONDO IN L. A. COUNTY. AND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND ALSO IS THAT THERE ARE UNITS THAT ARE COSTING AS MUCH AS SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THAT NUMBER IS GOING TO BE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS FOR SOME UNITS. WHICH I HAVE TO SAY I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AND COST PER BED IT'S ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND JUST SHY OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER BAD BUT THAT'S STILL VERY HIGH. SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM FIRST OF ALL TOO MUCH FUNDING COMPLEXITY ON AVERAGE WE FOUND. THAT OF FOR PROJECTS THAT WE'VE APPROVED FOR TRIPLE H. THERE ARE SEVEN FUNDING SOURCES IMAGINE PIECING TOGETHER SEVEN DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES IT TAKES YEARS IT TAKES A LOT OF CARRYING COSTS. A CHALLENGING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK- BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL OF THESE SUBSIDIES INVOLVED WE FOUND THAT MANY PROJECTS HAD AN UNUSUALLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF SOFT COSTS ANYWHERE BETWEEN. THIRTY FIVE AND 40% SOFT COST IN SOME CASES. OFTEN IT'S OF THE LAND USE CONSULTANTS THE LOBBYIST THE ATTORNEYS OF THE- OF COURSE COST OF CARING FOR YEARS AND YEARS. AND COST OF CONTINUE TO RISE WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF CONSTRUCTION OF MATERIALS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SO THE LONGER IT TAKES THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT GOES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE WAS A LIMITED POOL OF ELIGIBLE DEVELOPERS BECAUSE TRIPLE H. REGULATIONS. ARE REQUIRED TO LEAD DEVELOPERS TO DEMONSTRATE A HISTORY OF BUILDING AND MANAGING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS BUT THERE WAS NOT A BIG POOL OF THOSE AVAILABLE. AND OF COURSE LABOR COMES INTO IT AS WELL. I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO GET FASTER CHEAPER PROJECTS AND PEOPLE OFF THE STREET MORE. QUICKLY YOU LOOK AT A PROJECT HOME TO YOU LOOK AT PROJECT ROOM KEY LOOK AT SAFE SLEEPING VILLAGES SAFE PARKING. AND THESE ARE IN PERFECT BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO SAVE LIVES TODAY. AND ALSO WAYS TO REALLY MAKE THE WHOLE PROCESS OF TAX CREDITS MUCH MORE QUICK AND MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT. WITH BEING MORE NIMBLE WITH MORE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY IN THE STATE AND QUITE FRANKLY MORE COMMON SENSE AND I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL. FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR THE TIME OF THOSE WHO I SHARE THIS TABLE WITH AND FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK. ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO ARE ARE ON THE HOUSE. SISTERS AND BROTHERS THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FEDERAL FIFTY IF YOU'D BEGIN AND ALSO- WELFARE TITLE THE EXACT OF DIRECTOR FOR THE L. A. COUNTY- HOMELESS INITIATIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE REALLY GREATLY APPRECIATED AND I GOT A COUPLE A FEW EXTRA MINUTES- I TIME IT JUST THE- ONLY THE INTEREST OF TIME OF ALL THE SPEAKERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING- I'M SORRY TODOROV. I AM BE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE L. A. COUNTY HOMELESS INITIATIVE AND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY THANK YOU TO DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER FOR HOSTING AND FOR THE AMAZING WORK THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY. TO LIFT WOMEN OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. I'M I'M GONNA BEGIN BY TALKING JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF HOMELESSNESS IN L. A. COUNTY WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT SO I'LL MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THAT- AT OUR LAST- HOMELESS COUNT WE HAD OVER SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN OUR- COUNTY. OVER 70% OF THOSE RUN SHELTER. AND THIS NUMBER WAS UP FROM TWENTY NINETEEN AND AS ALREADY BEEN SAID WE EXPECT THAT UNFORTUNATELY WILL SEE THAT- WILL CONTINUE- TREND AS WE DO OUR COUNT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. BE ACCELERATING GAP BETWEEN SKYROCKETING SKYROCKETING HOUSING COSTS A LACK OF INCOME GROWTH. IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER. OF OUR HOMELESS AND HOUSING CRISIS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN L. A. COUNTY OR OVER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION RENTER HOUSEHOLDS. THAT IS HIGHER THAN THE NUMBER OF OWNER HOUSEHOLDS WHICH IS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR HALF A MILLION OF THOSE LOWEST INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS PAY OVER 50% OF THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON RENT. A UNITS CONSIDERED AFFORDABLE OF A RENT EQUALS NO MORE THAN 30% OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME. WHAT THAT MEANS IN OUR CITY HAS THAT A WORKER NEEDS TO EARN ALMOST FORTY DOLLARS PER HOUR OR MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES THE MINIMUM WAGE. TO FOR THE AVERAGE MONTHLY RENT OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS- OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS- IN THE COUNTY RENTS HAVE INCREASED 454% AND INCOMES HAVE INCREASED 16% SO IN ADDITION TO THE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS EVERY DAY WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLD ONE PAYCHECK ONE RENT BOB ONE ILLNESS ONE CAR REPAIR AWAY FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE FRIENDS. THIS CRISIS IS GROWING AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE MADE MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR HOMELESS SERVICES SYSTEM AND WE ARE WE HOUSING MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN COUNTY VOTERS APPROVED MEASURE H. WHICH IS A QUARTER CENT SALES TAX TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. FEFE THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAV BEEN PLACED IN PERMANENT HOUSING IN OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND IMPACTS SERVED AND SHELTERS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE PLACED IN PERMANENT HOUSING. TODAY L. A. COUNTY HAS AROUND THIRTY THOUSAND SHELTER BEDS. AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND PERMANENT HOUSING OPTIONS WE HAVE MADE D. INVESTMENTS AND SHELTER THE NUMBER OF SHELTER BEDS HAVE INCREASED ALMOST 60% OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. WE HAVE ALMOST THIRTEEN THOUSAND PERMANENT HOUSING UNITS THAT ARE IN DEVELOPMENT AND AT LAKE COUNTY. AND WE WANT TO SEE THEM DEVELOPING QUICKER ABSOLUTELY. I'M FEDERAL RENTAL SUBSIDIES ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR WE HOUSING EFFORTS ONE TYPE OF FEDERAL SUBSIDY PROJECT BASED VOUCHERS SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. WHICH IS HOUSING FOR PEOPLE EXPECTING HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT THE MOST COMPLEX HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OR L. A. CDA HAS OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED PROJECT BASED VOUCHER UNITS WITH ANOTHER FORTY ONE HUNDRED PROJECT BASED VOUCHER UNITS A PART OF ME FELT HIS COMMITTED TO HOUSING PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE. L. A. C. D. A. ADMINISTERS OVER TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND TENANT BASED VOUCHERS THAT ALLOW CLIENTS TO LEASE UNITS THE PRIVATE RENTAL MARKET ARE ESSENTIAL TO LIFT THE PEOPLE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE NO WHERE NEAR THE AMOUNT THAT WE NEED TO MEET THE NEED. SO NATIONALLY ABOUT ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE RECEIVE A VOUCHER. ANY FEARS EVEN MORE DESPERATE AS HE WITH ONE INTENT COUNTY RESIDENTS ACTION WHO QUALIFY ACTUALLY GET VOUCHERS. ANOTHER TALENTED THAT HAD ONLY ALLOWS UP 230% OF SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS TO BE USED FOR PROJECT BASED HOUSING AND WE ARE NEARING OUR CAP. THIS IS GREATLY IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND A VERY CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF THIS ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO WITH THE HOME KEY PROGRAM WELL ONE OF THE LIMITING FACTORS WITH BEING ABLE TO. ACQUIRE MORE HOME FOR UNITS OF WITH THE WITH THE STATE'S SUPPORT FOR THAT ACQUISITION RENOVATION. IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PROJECT BASED VOUCHERS TO PUT INTO THOSE PROJECTS SO THAT THEY HAVE LONG TIME OPERATING COSTS. SO I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- THE MOST RECENT STATE INVESTMENTS I'M- IN THE STATE IN AN L. A. COUNTY. SO AS WE KNOW IN OVER THE NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS THE STATE'S GOING TO BE ALLOCATING- SEVEN POINT SEVEN BILLION STATEWIDE DIRECTLY TO HOMELESSNESS RELATED FUNDING. WHICH INCLUDES TWENTY NINE DIFFERENT ALLOCATIONS ADMINISTERED ACROSS TEN DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS. THIS INCLUDES FUNDING FOR I'M HAPPY FOR THE HOMELESS HOUSING-ASSISTANCE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM HOME KEY ROOM KEY. CAL WORKS HOUSING H. TAPPED HOME SAFE IN A NUMBER OF OTHER INITIATIVES. AND THE L. A. COUNTY REGION IS ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION OF THOSE DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS. WITH THE LARGEST INVESTMENTS BEING AND THE HALF PROGRAM. HOME KEY. AND H. DOT. THIS THIS STATE FUNDING IS ALLOWING US TO CONTINUE SERVING SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. I'M TO OUR PROJECT ROOM KEY- PROGRAM WITH EXTENSION ABOUT FUNDING THROUGH THE HOME FEE PROGRAM WHERE THE COUNTY WE ACQUIRED EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN ROUND ONE. AND HOPE TO ACQUIRE ANOTHER THOUSAND IN ROUND TWO. AND WE'RE ALREADY LAUNCHING VITAL PROGRAMS WITH A HALF THREE FUNDING INCLUDING PARTNERING WITH CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTY TO OPEN MORE SHELTERS. AND ACTUALLY A PARTNERSHIP- RIGHT HERE WITH DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER- TO HELP END HOMELESSNESS FOR WOMEN IN SKID ROW. AND THAT IS DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE CITY FEDERAL INVESTMENTS THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. WE NEED MORE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES AS PREVIOUSLY STATED ONLY ONE IN FOUR ELIGIBLE PEOPLE GET THEM THAT NUMBER'S EVEN LESS HERE IN LA COUNTY. WE NEED MORE VOUCHERS AND WE NEED TO HAVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THOSE VOUCHERS TO BEST MEET THEIR LOCAL NEEDS. WHICH WOULD MEAN INCREASING OR ELIMINATING THE CAP ON PROJECT BASED VOUCHERS. WE NEED ONGOING IN LARGE AND- LARGER- FUNDING COMMITMENTS- FROM THE STATE THE STATE WIDE ONE BILLION FLEXIBLE FUNDING THROUGH. HAPPY IS A GAME CHANGER OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. IT WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPACTFUL. IT HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO WHAT THEY NEED BUT AWFUL ALSO THE OVERSIGHT AND OUTCOMES- THAT ARE EXPECTED- WITH. EXCUSE ME I'M- SO THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS AT THIS POINT THEIR SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS RIGHT THERE ONE TIME WE DON'T HAVE THE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING AND WITHOUT SUSTAINABLE FUNDING IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE PERMANENT INVESTMENTS. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR HOMELESS SERVICES PROVIDERS WHO DON'T HAVE CONTINUITY OF FUNDING TO REALLY BUILD STRONG PROGRAM TO MAINTAIN THEM OVER TIME WITH ALL OF THE SPENDING SWINGS. I'M AND THEN WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING- WE HAVE A SHORTFALL OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AFFORDABLE UNITS IN L. A. COUNTY AS A RESULT EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO HAVE A PAY TO PAY TO HAVE A WAY TO PAY THE RENT TO HELP ON THOSE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES. THEY CAN WAIT SIX MONTHS TWELVE MONTHS OR EVEN LONGER TO FIND A UNIT AND ALLOW LOCAL RENT TO THEM. SO SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY WITH THOSE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THEY HAVE AT THEIR EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THEY HAVE A WAY TO PAY THE RENT. THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT ABLE TO LEASE UP- THAT IS THAT IS LIKE THAT'S THE ULTIMATE SORT OF TRAGEDY IN THE SITUATION. I'M I THINK YOU KNOW WITH THAT- IN CONSIDERATION OF THE TIME- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND STOP AND TURN IT OVER K. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND EVERYBODY HERE FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING. FOR GIVING US HIS OPPORTUNITY- AND TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND I APPRECIATE YOU BEING VERY HONEST ABOUT THE STATE. CONSISTENT FUNDING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE- WERE HERE TO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK. IT'S CONTROL THANK YOU AND I KNOW- MISSILE IN YOUR CURRENT ROLE IN YOUR PREVIOUS ROLES YOU WERE VERY HARD WITH US TO DO. A NUMBER OF BIG PROJECTS. LIKE GETTING- SIX STREAMLINED FOR PERMITS FOUR THOUSAND MERGING SHELTERS. AS DID- MISTER HERTZBERG AND EVERYBODY HERE- LET THE TELL THE STORY COMPLAIN TEMPLE TOLD THAT LATER. BUT I THINK ARE MUCH IS ALSO GOING TO. THE VERY MUCH THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE A ANOTHER COMMITMENT THAT I HAVE TO BE A- YOU'RE NOT STAYING TO HEAR ME READ BUT- EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR PLACE. AN HONEST CONVERSATION. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT THAT I AM SURE YOU. PERHAPS ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE SOMETIME. MITCHELL PLEASE YOUR YOU KIND OF KNEW THE POSITION SO ALL YEARS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND GOOD MORNING I DON'T MEMBERS I AM ANSWERABLE THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE LOS ANGELES HOUSING DEPARTMENT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR FINANCING OF THE SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCLUDING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND MANAGING A PORTFOLIO OF OVER FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND AFFORDABLE UNITS- AND OVERSEEING THE RENT STABILIZATION PROGRAM EVICTION DEFENSE PROGRAM AND CODE ENFORCEMENT FOR ALMOST FAMILY HOUSING IN THE CITY. WE COORDINATE WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE TO WHO LEADS ON- FUNDING INTERIM HOUSING AND SHELTERS AND WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE ON ST STRATEGIES AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE WORK WE'VE DONE IN ALL THOSE AREAS- AND I THINK IF I IF I HAVE AN OVERALL THEME IT'S ADDRESSING THE CHAIR'S COMMENT THAT- TRENDING OAKS THAT. IT'S CRAZY TO KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULT AND I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE SAME THING IS THAT THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. IN A ROOM IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING OR IS IT THE CONSISTENT UNDERFUNDING PIECEMEAL FUNDING AND LACK OF REALISM ABOUT WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO PUT INTO THIS SO I'M GOING TO. BUILD YEAH SURE AND I DID NOT COORDINATE THIS TOGETHER BUT I'M GOING TO HIT ON THOSE THINGS. SO I WANT TO START WITH A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND THE AND THE ROLE OF THE STATE INVESTMENTS IN THAT IN THE CITY. AND THEN LOOK AT WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR ALL INJURY KNOWS AND CONSIDER THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATING COSTS OF VARIOUS MODELS. SO AS AS SHE MENTIONED IN THE CITY OF LA YOU KNOW THE VICTIMS AND THEN THIS IS A FALSE. HOMELESS PEOPLE DO NOT STAY IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU KNOW ONE CITY BUT THE CITY HAS FORTY ONE THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE LAST POINT IN TIME COUNT. AND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND OF THOSE PEOPLE ALMOST TWENTY NINE WERE AND SHELTERED. 64% WERE INDIVIDUALS 20% WERE FAMILIES 9% WERE SENIORS AND 7% REVIEWS. IN THE PAST THREE YEARS THE CITY HAS OPENED TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SHELTER BEDS AND FACILITIES RANGING FROM PROJECT ROOM KEY. AND PROJECT HOME CHEMO WITH TWO THOUSAND BEDS IN OUR BRIDGE HOME PROGRAM. TWO THOUSAND BEDS IN TINY HOME VILLAGES AND SAFE PARKING AND SAFE SLEEP SLEEPING SITES THAT PROVIDE. CHANCE ACCESS TO MEALS HYGIENE A CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. AS WELL AS TWENTY ONE HUNDRED RAPID RE HOUSING OR SHARED HOUSING VOUCHERS TO- TO LANDLORDS IN NONPROFIT SUCH AS DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER ALTHOUGH. AS WAS MENTIONED THAT THE LACK OF HOUSING SUPPLY MEANS THAT ONLY 30% OF THE VOUCHERS THE REGULAR- TENANT CHOICE VOUCHERS OR RAPID RE HOUSING VOUCHERS ARE BEING DEPLOYED AT ANY ONE TIME WE REALLY. NEED TO ADDRESS OUR SUPPLY ISSUES. THE CAPITAL. COST PER BED FOR SHELTERS RANGE FROM TWO HUNDRED AND TO. TWENTY THREE. TO PURCHASE A MOTEL ROOM. TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOR CONGREGATE SHELTER TO NOTHING FOR RENTED APARTMENTS. THE AVERAGE CAPITAL COSTS WAS ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND. THE MOST EXPENSIVE BEDS TEND TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE BEDS. YOU CAN GET CONCRETE SHELTERS THAT ARE NOT FULL BUT THINGS LIKE ROJECT ROOM KEY WHERE PEOPLE HAVE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE THEIR OWN THINGS IN THEIR PARTNERS AND THEIR PETS AND- YOU KNOW. BATHROOM IN A LOCKED DOOR ARE ARE FULL AND PEOPLE ARE NOT- LEAVING UNTIL THEY HAVE A HOUSING PLAN UNLIKE SOME OF THE- THE LESS- WITH THE SUPPORTED SHELTERS. THE MOST EXPENSIVE BEDS- LIKE PROJECT HOME KEEPER PURCHASED IN THE LAST FOR AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS OR BE CONVERTED TO PERMANENT HOUSING. AND THE LEAST EXPENSIVE PROFIT ON SITES LEAST FROM PUBLIC AGENCIES FOR THREE TO FIVE YEARS. IN TOTAL THE CITY AND OUR PARTNERS HAVE INVESTED THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION IN THE PRODUCTION OF THESE TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED BEDS. WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE PAID ATTENTION TO AN INTERIM SHELTERS ARE REALLY AND ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS OPERATING COSTS IF YOU CAN'T OPERATE IT THERE'S NO POINT IN BUILDING IT. AND THE INTERIM HOUSING OPERATING COSTS TEND TO AVERAGE ABOUT NINETY DOLLARS PER BED PER NIGHT. BECAUSE YOU NEED MEALS ON SITE STAFF SECURITY MAINTENANCE HELP FROM CASE MANAGERS. PERMANENT HOUSING PEOPLE PAY RENT OR THEY HAVE THE RENT VOUCHERS AND THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL OPERATING COSTS THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP INVESTING. IN THERE SO THE OPERATING COST PER BED PER NIGHT WORKS OUT TO ABOUT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND PER BED FOR YEAR. HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND OVER A FIVE YEAR TERM- OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. WE'VE SPENT. THE M. EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN AND FIFTY NINE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND. ON THE PRODUCTION OF THESE BEDS AND 33% HAS COME FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PRIMARILY FROM THAT. THEY KEEP THE HELP AND THE PROJECT HOME HE PROGRAMS ARE THE FUNDING SOURCES OF INCLUDED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S IMMER EMERGENCY SHELTER GRANT AND CO GOOD PROGRAMS AS WELL AS CITY GENERAL FUNDS. WE KNOW THAT INTERIM HOUSING IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO RAMP THAT UP AND IT IS CRUCIAL BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITHOUT PERMANENT HOUSING AT THE OTHER END INTERIM HOUSING IS A FALSE HOPE. SO SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAVE FUNDED EIGHTY FOUR HHH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS WITH FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED UNITS. SEVENTEEN OF THEM A HUNDRED WITH IT WITH A THOUSAND FORTY WHEN UNITS ARE COMPLETED. ANOTHER SIXTY SEVEN WITH FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED UNITS ARE IN CONSTRUCTION. THE KEY TAKEAWAY ABOUT HHH IS THAT WE STARTED OUT THE VOTERS APPROVED. ENOUGH MONEY TO DO SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS TO SUPPLEMENT THE CITY'S THREE THOUSAND UNITS. RIGHT NOW WITH HHH WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE UNITS. AT A SUBSIDY THAT'S FIFTEEN THOUSAND A UNIT LESS THAN WE PROJECTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND WE WILL BE DONE WITH IT TWO YEARS EARLIER THAN THE TEN YEARS WE PLANNED. SO EIGHT THOUSAND UNITS FIFTEEN THOUSAND UNIT LESS. TWO YEARS EARLIER IT IS TRUE THAT IT TOOK AWHILE TO GET THE FLY WHEEL GOING AND TO YOU KNOW START THAT PRODUCTION PROCESS. BUT THANKS TO THINGS LIKE AB ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO. AUTHORED A COUPLE YEARS AGO WITH A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR ALL AND EIGHTY TAKES PROJECTS FOR. OTHER PEOPLE AND MISTER HERTZBERG AND OTHERS. YOU KNOW WE ARE SEEING NOT ONLY COSTS GO DOWN BECAUSE DEVELOPERS DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO DO THINGS TO SATISFY PEOPLE WHO MIGHT FILE A SECRET LAWSUIT SO THEY'RE NOT. PUTTING IN A NEEDED PARKING AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT WE'RE ALSO JUST SEEING THINGS GO MUCH FASTER. THE MAYOR AND THE AND THE CITY DEPARTMENTS OF ALSO WORKED VERY HARD ON STREAMLINING AND WE HAVE REDUCE THE CUT THE TIMELINE TO GET PERMITS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. BY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS- AS PART OF THAT WORK. WE'VE ALSO- THE YOU KNOW THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME DOLLARS THAT WERE CREATED YOU KNOW AND FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND RATIFIED BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THEN SENATOR DALY- WHICH IS PUT IN NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND PER UNIT FOR THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED UNITS IN OUR PIPELINE SO FAR. WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THE MAJOR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PROJECT HOME KEEP PROGRAM WHICH WAS REALLY GREAT LAST YEAR ONE OF THE THINGS IT DID WAS IT PUT IN ONLY TWO SOURCES OF FUNDING AND THEY BOTH CAME TO THE CITY THERE WAS MONEY FROM THE STATE AND THEN WE HAD OUR OWN CORONAVIRUS MONEY SO PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE TO DO THE LEVERAGE FINANCING THE CITY WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE SIXTEEN HUNDRED UNITS- WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FROM THE STATE. AND M. FUNDS FROM US IN THE NEXT ROUND WE ARE HOPING TO INVEST- OUR OWN HHH MONEY HOME AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN MANY IN OTHER CITY FUNDS TO SECURE ENOUGH OF A STATE MATCH TO DO FOURTEEN HUNDRED UNITS AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED THE REAL LIMITING FACTOR THESE DAYS IS OPERATING MONEY AND WE'RE HOPING THAT BUILD BACK BETTER PASSES WITH A LOT MORE VOUCHERS. OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START GETTING REALLY CREATIVE IN HOW WE MEET THAT OPERATING MANY- I. SENSE FROM MIGUEL THAT I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME- I BASICALLY SPENT SOMETIME YESTERDAY TINKERING WITH WE KNOW ALL THESE COSTS WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN THOUSAND UNSHELTERED HOMELESS PEOPLE ON THE STREET. IT'S YOU KNOW I FOR SIX YEARS I'M NOT ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND LOS ANGELES AND JANET YELLEN WAS THE PRESIDENT AND JANET'S FAVORITE SAYING WAS LET'S BE DATA DRIVEN ABOUT THIS SO LET'S BE DATA DRIVEN LET'S THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO REALLY. ACTUALLY ADDRESS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED UNITS OF INTERIM HOUSING AND THEN THE PAYMENT HOUSING TO GO WITH IT. THE CAPITAL COSTS WOULD BE SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION TO DO. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED BEDS OF INTERIM HOUSING AND WE WOULD NEED ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR TO OPERATE IT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN INVESTMENT WORTH MAKING BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WOULD NEED TO DO SUPPORT OF HOUSING. SO THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT STAND IN A ROOM FOR EVER WE DON'T WANT TO BE NEW YORK TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW JUST PAYING INTERIM HOUSING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE NEED TO MOVE PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING AND SHOULD DO. ANOTHER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED UNITS WE'D NEED TWO POINT FIVE BILLION FROM THE CITY AND TWO POINT TWO BILLION FROM THE STATE AS WELL AS SUPPORT FROM. OUR FEDERAL AND STATE TAX CREDITS. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO FIND THAT MONEY AND- AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU BECAUSE I'M CHAIR AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR US BEING LATE I HAVE BEEN ON THE TABLE MY QUESTIONS IF I. SO IF ANY MEMBERS HERE HAVE QUESTIONS- AND I'M JUST GONNA MOVE A LITTLE BRIEF BECAUSE I WANT TO APOLOGIZE THE NEXT BECAUSE BECAUSE WE STARTED A LITTLE BIT LATE- DUE TO. RAIN AND- GET ALL SET UP OUTSIDE FIVE PAUL GEORGE PROFUSELY THE METHOD SPEAKERS. ON THE BILL. HI SO I USED TO BE THE OF PLANNING DEPUTY FOR CAREER NO USED TO DO AS THEY HAVE HOUSING DEPARTMENT HOUSING AUTHORITY CRLA LOOKS YOU REMEMBER CRLA- SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE CREATED WHAT'S CALLED A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHERE WE GOT EVERYBODY IN A ROOM PLANNING BUILDING SAFETY PUBLIC WORK BECAUSE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A BOTTLENECK GOVERNMENT WORKS IN SILOS AS I LISTEN TO EACH OF YOU. YOU'RE WORKING IN SILOS ONCE WE GOT THEM TO WORK TOGETHER GOT THEM ALL IN A ROOM TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THESE PROBLEMS- WE WERE ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE IF YOU LOOK AT DOWNTOWN LA THAT WAS BASED ON CASE MANAGEMENT WORKING TOGETHER. I'M HEARING THAT WE PROBABLY NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE HERE FOR ADDITIONAL THINGS AND SO IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE. EVERYONE'S WORKING TO GATHER IS LIKE YOUR PERFECT IN YOUR SILO BUT THERE IS NO CROSS POLLINATION SO YOU YOU MAY BE REALLY GOOD AT BUILDING HOUSING BUT THE PROGRAMMING IS ON A SEPARATE TRACK IN IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S CONNECTING SO- AT SOME POINT WHEN WILL WE ALL IN THE STATE WHATEVER YOU WANT FROM US WE ALL NEED TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME DO WE HAVE THAT MECHANISM WILL WE HAVE THAT MECHANISM IS THIS SOME HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. OR DOES NEED TO BE A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE. IT'S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT WITH THE ONE OF THE WAYS WE SHORTEN THE PROCESSING. IT IS CASE MANAGEMENT YOU KNOW THE HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS. BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN IF I HAD MY DRUTHERS RATHER THAN THE STATE HELPING ONE APPLICATION FOR ALL ITS HOUSING PROGRAMS. IT WOULD JUST DEFAULT ALL OF LA CITY AND ONLY COUNTY'S MONEY TO THE CITY AND COUNTY AS WE'RE DOING WITH HOME KEY. SO THAT WE COULD JUST HAVE ONE SOURCE OF FUNDING INSTEAD OF. OUR DEVELOPERS HAVING TO LOOK BACK AND FORTH SO. YEAH THERE IS NOT TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME. WE'VE WE'VE DONE THAT AND IT HASN'T MOVED IN SO THAT'S I'M NOT GIVING YOU A HARD TIME BUT- AS A SOMEBODY WALKS OUT OF YOUR HOME. THEY STILL SEE THE SAME HOMELESS PERSON SITTING. ENCAMPED FROM THEIR HOUSE. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE SOMETHING. HAPPEN VISUALLY MOVE SO- I DON'T THINK I'M NOT TWENTY HIGH TECH IS YOU CAN YOU CAN MARINADE ON THIS AND GET BACK TO ME BUT AT SOME POINT. VISUALLY WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN. AND I'M GONNA HEAD OVER TO MISTER HERTZBERG ABOUT RUSHING US IS ONLY TRY TO GET BACK ON TRACK SO I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT. MISTER HERTZBERG. WHY IS THE CITY COMPTROLLER WRONG IN THE ANALYSIS WOULD BE PROVIDED TO US. BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY PAINFUL. THAT'S A LONGER DISCUSSION AND WE PROBABLY HAVE TRIED SAYING THAT HE'S WRONG. I'M SAYING THAT TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NOT TALKING ABOUT THE OVERALL COST OF HOUSING. AS THOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING RIGHT OUTLIER IS- NOT PRESENTING ALL THE FACTS- AND I ALSO SAYING THE WORD HE'S NOT NECESSARILY- FOCUS ON SORT OF THE TREND OF SPEED WE DOUBT. WE ARE LITERALLY CLOSING HHH PROJECT EVERY TEN DAYS IN THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE A HUGE PIPELINE IN THE PROCESS AND IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS THEY WILL BE COMING ONLINE EVERY TEN DAYS BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS IT JUST TAKES AWHILE TO GET. THINGS GOING SECOND LAST IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- CRAIG LEGISLATION. THAT GAVE YOU EVERY NICKEL THAT YOU WANTED. WOULD YOU THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO AGREE TO A PROVISION THAT SAID IF IT WASN'T SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO PAY IT BACK. FOR THAT WE WOULD. REMOVE YOU FROM THAT PROCESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO TO BUY SOMETHING YOU WANT TO RESULT FINE HERE'S A CHECK GET IT DONE. WE GIVE A CHECK IT DOESN'T GET DONE HAS TO BE CONSEQUENCES ANY THOUGHTS ON THE- PAY IT BACK FROM WHAT DOES MANDATE DELIVER TAXPAYERS CITY LOS ANGELES BAY OR SOMEBODY BECAUSE THE REST OF THE STATE'S PICKING UP THE TAB FOR THIS AND FINE WE'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY WE'LL GIVE YOU CONTINUED FLOW BUT YOU GOTTA GET WORK AND DOESN'T WORK. WHAT'S THE PURPOSE THINK YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- YOU KNOW THE LIST THINGS THAT YOU WERE FUNDING OR ACTUALLY THE THINGS THAT YOU. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY FOR SUCCESS OTHER THINGS THAT WE FIND THE THINGS YOU TELL US TO BE DEFINED IF WE WANTED OF AUTHORITY TO THE CITY TO THE COUNTY. OKAY GIVE YOU THE MONEY YOU TELL US HOW YOU'RE GONNA DO IT. GO IMPLEMENTED SOLVE THE PROBLEM DON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM PAY IT BACK. AT A TIME LIKE THANK YOU FOR. IT UP I'M AT THE- LEGACY OF THAT OUT FOR. WELL AND PARTIALLY CONTROLLED. AND THEN MISTER OF MERCY IN ONLY RUBIO WOULD YOU GUYS ALLOW ME TO JUST THE NEXT PANEL AFTER THAT. THANK AYE AND THEN MISTER BLOOM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I A ON YOU KNOW- MISSY WELL YOU YOU YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU AND YOUR COMMENTS BY FOCUSING ON THE DATA BUT- I ALONG WITH CENTER HERTZBERG I MEAN I. YOU DON'T HAVE IT IT'S HARD NOT TO FOCUS ON- CONTROL CONFERENCE- EARLIER COMMENTS I THINK WHEN VOTERS. VOTED TO APPROVE MEASURE HHH THEY WERE NOT THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE UNIT. OF OF HOUSING TO BE BUILT TO BE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW WELL FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. I KNOW THAT WAY WHEN I. VISITED OF THE SOME OF THE THAT THE UNITS THAT THE IS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT. I MEAN I YOU KNOW I. IT WAS BETTER THAN THE APARTMENT THAT I LIVE IN IN SACRAMENTO YOU KNOW AND- AND IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED HOMELESS. YOU KNOW THREE TO FOUR PEOPLE A DAY SO WHEN I SEE THAT I DON'T SEE IT AND IT TAKES. IT TAKES FOUR TO SIX YEARS TO BUILD THESE UNITS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE NOW PRIORITISING EVEN MORE SO. YOU KNOW THE SHELTERS OVER THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I UNDERSTAND LONG TERM PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS NEEDING. BUT IN THE MEANTIME PEOPLE ARE DYING AND WE NEED TO SHOW THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR THE TAX INCREASE. TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS PROBLEM BY PRIORITIZING SHELTERS. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IT MUST BE BOTH BANDS BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE AWHILE TO DO HOUSING AT THE END SO WE NEED TO DO IMMEDIATE INTERIM HOUSING SHELTERS. AND WE NEED TO ALSO KEEP A PIPELINE GOING SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO MOVE TO. DATE JUST LAST COMMENT IS IT WE HAVE LIMIT WILL HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES IT'S A MATTER PRIORITIES THANK YOU. AND I'M GOING TO HAND IT OVER TO MR BLOOM- THANK YOU- ONE OF BUT- THE SITUATIONS THAT WE FACE NOW IS THAT ON A DAILY BASIS MORE PEOPLE ARE ENTERING HOMELESSNESS THAN WERE ACTUALLY HOUSING WE'VE HEARD THAT- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS OVER AND OVER AGAIN- HERE IN LOS ANGELES. SO WHAT IS THE ROLE OF PREVENTION KEEPING PEOPLE IN THEIR EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO- THEY DON'T. END UP ON THE STREET IN THE FIRST PLACE. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT ACTUALLY PREVENTION IS ESSENTIAL AS YOU'RE SAYING WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS EACH DAY THAT WE HAD X. HITTING IT DESPITE ALL OF THE NEW INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE MADE AND IS CONTINUING GROWTH- PREVENTION IS VERY COMPLICATED THERE'S THE PIECE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE IN THE HOUSING THAT THEY'RE IN RIGHT NOW. WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST ESSENTIAL THING A SODA SOMEBODY FALLS INTO HOMELESSNESS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING HOUSE BEGAN AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES JUST TO GET AT IT. SACRAMENTO EXPONENTIALLY MORE COMPLICATED- AND SO HELPING WITH YOU KNOW IF EXTEND- PREVENTION LEGAL DEFENSE OF HELPING- WITH- PREVENTING FORECLOSURES AMONG LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS ALL OF THOSE ARE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THEN THERE'S A LARGER SORT OF EVEN BACKING UP FURTHER PREVENTION WHICH I KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT PREVENTION STARTS WAY BEFORE THAT IT TALKED ABOUT ACCESS TO EDUCATION. IT TALKS ABOUT HOUSING WHEN YOU'RE A CHILD IT IS ABOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS ABOUT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE WAGES ALL OF THOSE THINGS- ARE ARE IMPACTING THE INFLOW OF PEOPLE INTO HOMELESSNESS UNTIL WE GO BACK THAT FAR START ADDRESSING THOSE THINGS IT'S GONNA. BE VERY HARD TO STOP THAT FLOW OF PEOPLE. THANK YOU AND I. THE COMMITTEE ALLOWING ME TO RUSSIA THROUGH- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I GOT A BIG JOB AHEAD OF YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO. REEMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AFTER THE TOUGH QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD BE ASKING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT AS TO- AND I REALIZE THAT YOU'RE NEW TO DESIGNING AND STUFF BUT THE PROGRAMMING. YOU'RE DOING THE BEST IMPLEMENTED. BUT I THINK FROM A VOTER PERSPECTIVE- FOR ANY ANYBODY IN IN PUBLIC BECAUSE THEY'RE ANYBODY FOR ANYBODY PUBLIC OFF ANYBODY'S IS WATCHING THIS. THING I THINK WOW. WHAT A BOONDOGGLE FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A UNIT YOU SAID. THOUSAND DOLLARS UNIT YOU KNOW. BUT BUT BUT LOOK HAVING HAVING SAID THAT I KNOW YOU DO THE VERY BEST JOB AND IF YOU CAN HELP WITH THAT. TO IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT THE STATE CAN DO TO FACILITATE THAT LET US KNOW. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF HOW WE WORK THROUGH THIS LIKE YOU WERE HOPEFUL TO SEE PROJECTIONS. AND I EXTREMELY APPRECIATE. YOUR HARD WORK IN HELPING US TO GET THAT DONE. THANK YOU I'M GONNA CALL UP THE NEXT. COMMITTEE BUT THANK YOU ONE ROUND OF APPLAUSE EIGHT I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEING- SO I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT AND I'M RUSHING TO GET US STARTED ON THE NEXT PANEL WERE WERE. VERY- WE'RE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR SUPERVISORS LEASES- COUNCILMEMBER OF RAMAN AND- MISS MARTIN TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT. AND- I THANK YOU FOR COMING- AND I'M GONNA JUMP RIGHT IN I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO- AND INTERACTIONIST LEASE AT ALL BECAUSE I THINK- YEAH BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL KNOW. EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE AND YOUR HARD WORK AND ADVOCACY ON THE HOMELESS ISSUE THEY WERE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE WITH US TODAY THANK YOU- THANK YOU. FOR YOUR I'M JUST I'M JUST KEEPING A RUNNING TALLY JUST TO TRY TO GET BACK OKAY I'LL TRY TO BE ON THE FIVE MINUTE ENOUGH I CAN I DON'T HAVE TO READ ALL THIS. WHICH IS GREAT. APPLE KILL ME BUT THAT'S OKAY AND WHAT WE KNOW HOW THAT IS. WHAT WE SAID TO THE EARLIER DAYS IT IS WE WANT TO. THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY SO WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER WE'RE STANDING SO THERE'S THINGS THAT THE STATE HASN'T DONE. YEAH I MEAN WE NEED TO HEAR THAT RIGHT I MEAN. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. OKAY I DON'T KNOW I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I'M VERY. HONORED TO PLEASE EVEN VIæT ME TO BE HERE- I'M GLAD. WHAT I'M HEARING ALREADY IN TERMS OF DISCUSSION. IS SOME OF WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID- BUT I'LL PUT IT IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT. BUT I WANT TO ALSO OFFERS THANK THE- DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TREMENDOUS. IN HOSTING US FOR SEVERAL EVENTS WE'VE HAD SOME MAJOR- MEETINGS HERE BUT- THE FACT THAT- AS YOU WALK INTO THIS- PROJECT YOU SEE. OUTSIDE THAT THERE ARE MANY- HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE. THAT ARE NOT HERE AND A WARM TAN. DON'T HAVE COFFEE. DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS AND DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE EVEN GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH. THE NEXT FEW WEEKS SO. WE REALLY HAVE AN URGENCY. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT. AND AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I JUST GAVE OVER. MY CHAIRMANSHIP I AM NOW- DURING THE GAVEL OVER TO ONE OF YOUR FORMER COLLEAGUES- THAT'S A- SUPERVISOR HOLLY MITCHELL WHO I KNOW IS VERY. VERY KEENLY AWARE OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE HERE- AND I JUST WANT TO SAY. IF I MIGHT. AND YOU HEARD THIS ALREADY. THE MOTOR OF LAWCENTER COUNTY OR THINKER. CHEN ON THE ISSUE THEY HAVE BEEN THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THEY HELPED US PASSED. MEASURE H. WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT. AND MANY OF THOSE CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTY PARTICIPATED IN THAT WE HAD TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING OF AN INVESTMENT THAT THEY COULD GET A RETURN ON- I WANT TO SAY THAT- THUS FAR- WE'VE LEARNED. THROUGH OUR OWN- MISTAKES. AND PROGRESS. THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT TO BE DONE- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE FOR EXAMPLE- SINCE A- JULY ABOVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND. PEOPLE THAT THE EXIT HOMELESSNESS INTO PERMANENT HOUSING THAT'S SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT MAY SOUND OKAY. BUT WHEN YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT ANNUALLY EVERY YEAR YOU SEE MORE THAN. SIXTY SIX THOUSAND EIGHT IN AN UPWARD THAT NUMBERED ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF PANDEMIC WE'RE REALLY WE'RE REALLY CHASING MY TAIL HERE. TO TELL THE DOC INSTEAD OF HELPING TO LEAD AND I THINK WE CAN DO A LOT MORE THERE I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. AND I THINK THAT WHAT I'VE HEARD ALREADY FROM OTHERS SPEAKERS IS THAT THERE HAS TO BE A PARALLEL TRACK HERE. I GET IT THE PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO SEE FOLKS OUTSIDE NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO BE HUMILIATE THE MILLIE AIDED IN THAT MATTER ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO- WOMEN WOMEN WITH CHILDREN. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FACILITIES TO DEAL WITH THE GROWING NUMBER OF WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN. AND WE NEED TO WE REALLY NEED TO PRIORITIZE THAT TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO LONG BEFORE MANY OF US WERE HERE- THERE WAS A CHANGING THE TRAJECTORY IN TERMS OF HOW YOU DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH BILL% ILLNESS. SUBSTANCE ABUSE WE KNOW THAT STORY WE DON'T WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH- BOARDING CARE FACILITIES THEIR CLOSING LIKE THAT. THOSE ARE FACILITIES THAT WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN RIGHT AWAY AND PUTTING MONEY AND PUTTING OUR STOCK IN THAT. LAST TIME- I THINK OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SANTIAGO WE JOINED THE GOVERNOR AT A FACILITY THAT WAS IN OUR DISTRICT THAT IS ACTUALLY OF WAS WAS- GIVEN A LIFEBOAT. SO THAT THEY COULD PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE THAT DON'T NEED A CUTE ASSISTANCE AND IT'S LESS COSTLY BUT DO IT THROUGH BOARDING CARE TYPES OF FACILITIES AT THE PEPPER ALL OF OUR CITIES ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. THOSE HAVE BEEN CLOSED- THAT MODEL I THINK HAS TO BE REVAMPED IN THE AND WE HAVE A ROLE THERE I THINK THAT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND THE VARIOUS CITIES AND I'M GONNA SPEAK. NOT JUST ABOUT THE CITY OF LA BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB WE HAVE BEEN ACTIS REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB THERE'S A LOT OF CRITICISM THAT COULD BE THROWN. AT ANY ONE OF US ANY SINGLE DAY BUT I WILL SAY YOU YOU THAT SOME OF US. DO ONE TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN. AND I WOULD ASK YOU BECAUSE WE SEE A SURPLUS IN CALIFORNIA THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT WE REALLY CAN'T BE CHEAP ON THIS ISSUE. AND I WILL POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW ARE COUNTY DID WAS ASK FOR I BELIEVE TEN. I THINK IT WAS TEN BILLION DOLLARS THROUGH THE H. H. A. P. FUNDS. AND SO FAR I'VE I'VE LEARNED THAT WE'VE ONLY RECEIVED. IT FOR TWO YEARS A BILLION EACH YEAR. WHERE DOES THAT COME CLOSE TO HELPING US WITH PROVIDING THE REAL. SUBSTANTIVE KIND OF SERVICES THAT PEOPLE REALLY NEED YOU HEARD ABOUT IT ALREADY. NOT ALL OF IT IS JUST ABOUT BUILDING FACILITIES IT'S ABOUT THE OPERATIONAL COSTS AND THE STAFFING COSTS WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE DOING HERE. IS TAKE A TAKE A NOTE A FOOTNOTE OUT OF THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION. AND THAT IS WE WANT TO PUT A PUT A PERSON ON. THE MOON. WHY CAN'T WE PUT TAKE PEOPLE OUT OF. THIS OUT OF THE SIDEWALKS AND PUT THEM IN HOUSING NOT AND I AM NOT SEEN PERMANENT HOUSING I'M SAYING BILL TWO TRACKS. INTERIM AS WELL AS AFFORDABLE AND AFFORDABLE CAN BE DONE IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE STATE CAN DO RIGHT AWAY WITH THAT SURPLUS IS HELP US PROVIDE. A FUNDING STREAM THAT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY IN TWO YEARS AFTER YOU. EXHAUST YOUR YOUR SURPLUS BUT THAT THERE IS AN ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM SO THAT WE HAVE OPERATIONAL FUNDING. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED THE EXPERIENCE THAT I CAN SPEAK VERY HONESTLY ABOUT. DURING MEASURE H. WE THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A CURE FOR MANY OF MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY. WELL UNFORTUNATELY WE FOUND OUT THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO IN PART OF IT WAS. IS THAT. LHASA THE COUNTY WE REALLY. WE REALLY STE STOOD UP TO TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE ENGAGE TO BUILD OUT THIS SO CALLED NEW DEPARTMENT SO TO SPEAK. WE HIRED PEOPLE FROM OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES FROM THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY IN PARTICULAR. COME AND WORK FOR LASSA WHICH IS GREAT BUT GUESS WHAT WE DIDN'T BACK FILL. THOSE POSITIONS. SO IN THE SOUTH GATE AREA IN THE GATEWAY AREAS WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A BIG VACUUM IN TERMS OF STAFFING. AND WE CAN'T JUST TAKE OUR EYE OFF. OFF THE- MARKER THERE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FEED THAT SYSTEM. AND WE NEED TO ENGAGE NOT JUST OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD LIVED EXPERIENCES. TO GET THEM TRAINED. DOES IT WANT TO BECOME PARTNERS WITH US SO THAT THEY BECOME OUR TEAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND THEY CAN SPEAK THE LANGUAGE WE NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE TRULY. CULTURALLY COMPETENT. TO DEAL IN ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT DISTRICTS BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT SPEAK WHAT OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR MORE LANGUAGES. IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HIRE PEOPLE UP AND PAY THEM GOOD WAGES FOR THAT AS WELL. AND NOT. NOT PICK FROM ONE OF PART OF THE CITY OR THE COUNTY AND BRING THEM ALL INTO ONE AREA WE NEED TO HAVE A FORM TEAM AND THAT COSTS MONEY THAT'S OPERATIONAL COSTS. AND THENIF WE ARE GOING TO BE CHARGED THE COUNTY TO DEAL WITH OPERATIONAL COSTS. AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE ABOUT THAT AS WELL. AND KEEP IN MIND MANY OF THE SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE. ARE TIED TO FORMULAS WHY DON'T WE HAVE. AN URGENCY TO LOOK AT HOW YOU DE COUPLE THAT AND IT ISN'T JUST THIS THE COUNTY OR THE STATE IT'S ALSO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE A PART OF THIS DISCUSSION WITH A SO I AGREE SOMEONE. SAID THAT EARLIER THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE FENCE HERE ABSOLUTELY. AND WITH THE NEW INITIATIVES THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION I BELIEVE THAT WE COULD DO THINGS WITH HUD. WE CAN DO. WE CAN DO OF JOB CREATION WORKFORCE TRAINING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SAFE MAYBE AT THE INTERIM. HOUSING LEVEL TO GET THEM INTO JOB TRAINING AND THEN BEGIN TO HELP THEM BECOME MORE RISK BILLION. AND THERE ARE PROGRAMS WE CAN SET UP TO DO THAT THE COUNTY ALREADY IS. IS PILOTING PROGRAMS TO DO THAT WE WANT TO HIRE UP THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TREATING. SO WE'RE BRINGING IN OUR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARDS WHICH YOU HAVE. FUNDING STREAMS AVAILABLE WHY COULDN'T YOU EARMARK SOME OF THAT. TO BE PLACED IN THOSE PARTICULAR SETTINGS WHERE WE ARE IT IS CHRONIC. I WOULD ALSO ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT- I KNOW THE COST OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S ASTRONOMICAL. AND WE'RE WE'RE IN THIS MODE NOW WERE. MANY PEOPLE DON'T WANT DEVELOPERS DON'T WANT TO ENTER INTO THAT FIELD BECAUSE OF. THE COMPLEX LICENSING PERMITTING PROCESS AND WHAT HAVE YOU WELL GUESS WHAT WE DID NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE AND I. WOULD INVITE ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE COME AND VISIT. THE CARE VILLAGE ON BIG MYSTERY. WHICH WAS INITIALLY GOING TO BE- USED AS A PARKING LOT TO BUILD THE MEN'S CENTRAL JAIL. THAT'S IN MY DISTRICT I SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO WE'RE NOT GOING TO BUILD ANYTHING. OTHER THAN. A SHELTER FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE AND WE DID IT WITH CARES ACT MONEY WE COUPLED OUR OWN MONEY I PUT IN. I WOULD SAY SIX SIX A MILLION OF MY OWN DISCRETIONARY MONEY WHICH ISN'T AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME FOR EVERYBODY. HOWEVER WE USED A CARES ACT MONEY AND WE WERE ABLE TO PUT UP A FACILITY THAT IS NOW HOUSING. INTERIM HOUSING. TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO UNITS OF HOUSING AND SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID EARLIER- WHICH I TOTALLY AGREE WITH. YOU GIVE DIGNITY AND RESPECT TO SOMEONE WHEN THEY HAVE. THEIR OWN RESTROOM IN THE SAME FACILITY IN THE SAME FACILITY SO. THE MOTELS HOTELS PROJECT ROOM P. HONKY I TOTALLY AGREE WITH CELLS. AND I WANT TO SEE THAT ENCOURAGE MORE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT ENCOURAGED. BUT YOU CAN ALSO INVEST IN NEW INNOVATIVE PROJECTS. WE HAVE THE TINY HOMES THAT'S ONE. BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE CONTAINERS AND CONTAINERS IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD WORD TO DESCRIBE WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE LIVING NOW. BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO WALK INTO ONE OF THOSE UNITS. YOU WOULD THINK YOU WERE YOU WERE GOING INTO A- UPSCALE. NOT EVEN MOTEL SIX BECAUSE ARE CLEANER THAN THAT. YOU YOUR OWN BATHROOM. THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE FACILITIES THREE STORIES STACK STACKABLE CONTAINERS. THE COST IS BEEN REDUCED MORE THAN HALF SO YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PER UNIT. YOU CAN CUT IT IN HALF THEY CAN BE EASILY PUT UP IN A MATTER OF TIME WE DID OURS IN SIX MONTHS AND PARTLY BECAUSE WE CONTROLLED. SEEK WHAT. THE REGULATIONS SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO ALSO THINK ABOUT. LEADING US FOR LEASING OR- GRANTING. SOME PROPERTY THAT KEPT THAT THAT THE STATE OWNED AND NOT JUST CALTRANS PROPERTY YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE PROPERTY. A LOT OF PROPERTY IN MY DISTRICT. IT IS JUST. OF BECOMING ENCAMPMENTS. WHY DON'T WE START TARGETING THOSE AREAS. IT'LL BE LOW COST GIVE IT OVER TO THE COUNTY OR WHOEVER FOR A DOLLAR. AND LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN BUILD THEIR INTERIM AND PERMANENT. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DEAL WITH WITH US CITIES OUTSIDE OF JUST BARELY CITY BECAUSE OUR PROBLEM IS IT ALL JUST. L. A. CITY IN SKID ROW. YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE LIVING IN THE WATERSHED IN AZUSA CANYON IN WHITTIER NARROWS IN OUR PARKS. WE DON'T WANT THAT. WE WANT A BETTER LIFE FOR THEM BUT WE CAN'T JUST PICK THEM UP SCOOP THEM UP AND SEND THEM WHERE IF THERE'S NO FACILITIES ALSO. INDICATED AREAS IN CITIES THAT ARE TO SMALLER CITIES. THAT ARE RIGHT NOW GOING THROUGH NIMBYISM. I'VE I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT. FOR THE LAST. THREE YEARS NOW. AND IT'S BEEN VERY HARD BUT I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS SOME ENCOURAGEMENT. THROUGH THE TRUST FUND THAT YOU WILL HELP TO ESTABLISH I THINK CENTER RUBIO. HAD SOME FUNDING SET ASIDE FOR FAR SAN GABRIEL VALLEY CAUGHT. SHE PUT IN I THINK FIVE MILLION I THINK SHE'S GOING TO PUT TWENTY WE PUT IN ALSO MONEY. SO IT ISN'T AS THOUGH WE'RE SAYING GIVE ME A HAND OUT WE'RE SAYING WILL HELP MATCH YOU. IN THE WAY THAT WE-CAN. BUT TO START BILL DOES BRIDGE BUILDING THOSE BRIDGES WITH SOME OF OUR CITIES. THE OTHER EIGHTY SEVEN CITIES IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL OF YOU REPRESENT DIFFERENT AREAS. THROUGHOUT THIS THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND IF WE REALLY ARE GOING TO BEAT THIS OR LOOK AT OTHER- MECHANISMS THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS AND ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY- WE OPENED UP. OF TWENTY SEVEN I THINK TINY HOMES INVOLVED PARK. NEXT TO A LOT THAT THE CITY OWNED. SO ENGAGE CITIES CITIES TO HELP PROPERTY THAT ARE THAT ARE JUST SITTING THERE IDLE WHY COULDN'T WE START TO LOOK AT HOW STRATEGICALLY WE CAN PLAN. TO BUILD MORE HOUSING UP MAKE IT SAFE MAKE IT SECURE BUT CONTINUE TO HAVE. THIS DISCUSSION THAT IT HAS TO BE ONGOING OPERATIONAL BUT SO THE FIRST THING THE CITY OF BALLPARK. AND SOME OF OUR OTHER CITIES ARE TELLING US KILL THE WILL ENGAGE WITH YOU MONTEBELLO WILL- AND OTHER CITIES. BUT THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE OPERATE OPERATING COSTS ARE GOING TO COME THAT IS GOING TO COME OUT OF MEASURE H. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY. AND THAT IS GOING TO END IN SEVERAL YEARS SO WE KNOW IF I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO GO BACK OR WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GO BACK. TO OUR TAXPAYERS WOULD HAVE TO SHOW THEM SOME RESULTS. AND WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SAY IT IN A WAY THAT ALL OF US ARE REALLY ENGAGED. SO I WOULD REALLY ASK FOR THAT AND I WOULD INVITE YOU AGAIN TO PLEASE COME OUT AND VISIT. THE VILLAGE THAT WE PUT UP. IT HAS A DOG PARK THERE IS A SEPARATE FACILITY THAT HAS A KITCHEN. A STATE OF THE ART KITCHEN THAT WILL BE USED AS SOON AS IT'S POP PROPPED UP. FOR TRAINING CULINARY ARTS. NO BIG IDEA THERE JUST. PUT THE KITCHEN TO USE THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE. ALSO FACILITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE IN A CONTAINED AREA WHERE. THERE'S A WASHERS DRYERS AND ALL OF THAT. EVERYBODY THAT COMES IN IS DIAGNOSED TO GET CASE. BIGGEST CASE MANAGEMENT. AND IT'S BEING DONE THERE'S- A LIKE I SAID THERE'S EVEN A DOG PARK THERE I MEAN WHO WOULD THINK OF THAT. RIGHT BECAUSE MANY OF OUR HOMELESS ARE ATTACHED TO THEIR PETS. AND THEY WON'T GO INTO SHELTERS UNLESS THEY CAN BRING THEIR PETS. SO WHY ARE WE DENYING PEOPLE. THINGS THAT. THEY HELP THEM. FEEL FEEL BETTER ABOUT WHO THEY ARE- ONE THING I WILL I WILL SAY TO YOU. AND SOME OF YOU HEARD THIS I THINK- THAT WERE THAT WERE- IT WAS LAST YEAR TOO WHEN WE WENT UP TO SACRAMENTO TO TALK TO THE DELEGATION. ABOUT HELPING US FIND A RESTORATIVE CARE VILLAGES AND WHAT I'M SAYING THERE IS THAT KELLY C. WITH C. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE ALREADY BUILT I'D SAY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND OF. A HUNDRED AND SIXTY UNITS OF RECUPERATIVE BEDS. BEDS AND THAT MEANS SO THE- WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT JUST LOCKING PEOPLE UP BECAUSE IT ISN'T ABOUT THAT IT'S GIVING THEM THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED. SO THEY COME OUT OF JAIL OR THE COME OUT OF BEING HOMELESS ON THE STREET. WE CAN WE CAN ATTACH THE HEALTH CARE UNIT IT'S RIGHT ADJACENT THERE THEY CAN GET THE APPROPRIATE. MEDICAL TREATMENT. AND THEN HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO STEP DOWN FROM THOSE UNITS. THAT THAT FACILITY WILL BE OPEN IN SPRING. SO I HOPE THAT. I HOPE THAT SOMEBODY WILL COME AND VISIT US BECAUSE THAT FACILITY THE BUILDINGS ARE ALREADY PHYSICALLY THERE. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO INVITE YOU. AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT ON OUR OWN PROPERTY ACROSS. FROM FROM OUR HOSPITAL- IN OUR PARKING LOTS WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO BUILD TWO HUNDRED ADDITIONAL UNITS OF LOW INCOME. HOMELESS HOUSING BUT WE NEED FUNDING. AND WE NEED DEVELOPERS IT'LL WORK WITH US AND BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ON OUR PROPERTY WE COULD EXPEDITE I BELIEVE. THOSE PERMITS AND SEEK WAS IN IS IN OUR IS IN ARE ALL. YOU KNOW IS WITH US AND THOSE THINGS CAN BE EXPEDITED SO ALL OF THAT I THINK COMING TOGETHER CAN HELP US. AND THERE'S A PLAN TO CREATE THESE RESTORATIVE CARE VILLAGES ON ALL OF THE FIVE CAMPUSES WHERE WE HAVE HOSPITALS SO WE'RE DOING IT AT MARTIN LUTHER KING WE'RE GONNA BE DOING IT YOU SEE LA ALL OF THESE. DIFFERENT FACILITIES THAT THE THAT THE COUNTY OWNS SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AND AM VERY HAPPY TO BE TO BE HERE WITH YOU AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BOARD BECAUSE- EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. HAVE BUILT DIFFERENT FACILITIES AND ARE LOOKING AT BUILDING OUT MORE HOME KEY ROOM KEY AS WELL AS A PARTICULAR HOUSING UNITS AFFORDABLE IN JUST ABOUT EVERY DISTRICTS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE TO SAY LOOK I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDID BALANCED CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE COUNTY IS WHAT SPARKED. MY MASCOT STUCK WITH THE COUNTY NEED TO DO WITH THE STATE NEED TO DO WITH THE CITY NEEDS DO WHAT THE FEDS NEED TO DO. THAT'S THE KIND OF CONVERSATION WE NEED BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. I MEAN WILL WE DON'T FIX IT WE DON'T DON'T. FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK TOGETHER. FIVE PRESET YOUR CANDID- ON HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE- CALDERON WOULD YOU. KINDLY JOIN EVERYBODY WHO'S WHO'S IT OUT HERE IN THE CALL TO GET A MAN YOUR WHOLE. THIS IS YOUR LIFE. COMPLETELY NO. SECTION GREAT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY I'M A DEER ALMOND COUNCIL MEMBER FOR THE FOURTH DISTRICT HERE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. IN THE- IN THE LESS THAN A YEAR WILL BE A YEAR NEXT WEEK THAT I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE. WHAT I'VE SEEN HAS WORKED. FROM OUR EFFORTS IN OUR OFFICE AT ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IN OUR DISTRICT- AND WHAT HASN'T WORKED- IN TERMS OF OUR BROUGHT IT BROUGHT A RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS- BOTH IN MY DISTRICT AND IN THE CITY AS A WHOLE. SO WHAT'S WORKED. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES ABOUT THIS PERIOD FROM ANY PERIOD THAT I THINK THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS EVER EXPERIENCED IN ITS IN PART THANKS TO. STATE FUNDING IS THE AMOUNT OF RENT RELIEF THAT'S BEEN AVAILABLE FOR STRUGGLING TENANTS- THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY BOTH FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT. HAS GONE TOWARDS RENTERS TO HELP THEM STAY HOUSED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR EFFORTS IN OUR DISTRICT. IS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY GONE DOOR TO DOOR IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS- IN OUR DISTRICT OUR STAFF HAS IN A QUORUM VOLUNTEERS. HAS GONE DOOR TO DOOR AND WHAT WE FOUND IN THAT WORK. IS THAT. THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR BETTER PATHWAYS BETWEEN STRUGGLING TENANTS AND THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. EVEN WHEN THAT FUNDING IS GIVEN TO US THE MONEY TO ACTUALLY CREATE THOSE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN TENANTS. AND THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE RIGHTS AND RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM IS STILL VERY MUCH MISSING. FOR EXAMPLE IN MY OWN DISTRICT WHICH IS A RELATIVELY HIGH RESOURCE- MOSTLY ENGLISH SPEAKING DISTRICT- WE'VE DISTRIBUTED THOUSANDS. OF PIECES OF LITERATUREAT DOORS WE'VE HAD OVER SIX HUNDRED CONVERSATIONS WITH HOUSEHOLDS. AND A HUGE NUMBER OF THEM WERE BEHIND ON THEIR RENT AND WERE NOT AWARE. OF THE KIND OF DOLLARS THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR FROM THE CITY FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHICH WAS ASTOUNDING TO US- AND SO MAKING THOSE OTHER CONNECTIONS TO WHENEVER YOU FIND RESOURCES FOR TENANTS. TO HELP THEM STAY HOUSE TO HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR HOMES. TO ALSO IN THE SAME BREATH FUND RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE RESOURCES. IS GETTING OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO MOST DESPERATELY NEED IT. THAT'S A MISSING PIECE THAT I THINK THE STATE AND THE CITY CAN DO MUCH BETTER IN FUNDING TOGETHER. THE SECOND THING WHICH IS REALLY WORKED IN OUR DISTRICT. HAS BEEN FOCUSED PLACE BASED EFFORTS AT HOUSING FOLKS SO WHAT'S SO WHAT'S BEEN CALLED THE IN CAMERA TO HOME. A KIND OF MODEL AT GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS- THAT'S FOCUSED EFFORTS AT SINGLE ENCAMPMENTS. YOU WORK WITH THEM OVER TIME AND YOU WORK WITH THEM TO GET PEOPLE. INDOORS AND IT'S WORKED BECAUSE OF TWO REASONS ONE IT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE AT ENCAMPMENTS OFTEN PARTICULARLY IN THIS PERIOD WHEN ENCAMPMENTS HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE IN THOSE ENCAMPMENTS HAVE ALSO BUILT UP A SENSE OF COMMUNITY WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND SO HELPING PEOPLE TO MOVE INDOORS WITH THAT COMMUNITY OR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THAT COMMUNITY HAVING SOMEONE FROM THAT COMMUNITY GO INDOORS COME BACK OUT TO THE NGAGEMENT AND SAY. HEY IT'S GREAT IN THERE COME WITH ME THAT HAS REALLY WORKED AT ACTUALLY HELPING US TO- GET EVERYONE HOUSE AT A PARTICULAR IN CANTON AND HAVE THAT ENCAMPMENTS STAY CLEAR GO ON AN ONGOING BASIS. IT'S REALLY REALLY REMARKABLE IT'S ALSO WORKED BECAUSE RESOURCES ARE SUPER SCARCE FOR OUTRAGE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE DOLLARS IN IT. AND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD BE SCARCE BUT IT IS SCARCE AND IT'S ALSO FRAGMENTED. IT'S HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND SO WHAT ENCAMPMENTS HOME OPERATION DOES IS THAT IT HELPS US TO FOCUS IT BECOMES LIKE A WEEKLY MEETING THAT YOU CAN HAVE ABOUT A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS MONITOR THEIR PROGRESS AND HELP THEM GO IN OVERTIME. IT FORCES YOU TO DO THAT COORDINATION WORK THAT I THINK SHOULD BE HAPPENING SYSTEM WIDE ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT IT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO ON IN CANTON BY CANTON LEVEL. THE THIRD I THINK THAT HAS WORKED AND I THINK- SUPERVISORS LEASE YOU MENTION THIS AS WELL A ROOM WITH THE DOOR. THE ABILITY TO HAVE A ROOM WITH THE DOOR TO OFFER INDIVIDUALS WHETHER IT'S A TINY HOME WHETHER IT IS A BIG NO STYLE FACILITY- WHETHER IT IS UP PRK ROOM WHETHER IT IS AN APARTMENT IT KIND OF DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF ROOM WITH THE DOOR IT IS. BUT THAT ROOM WITH THE DOOR GETS PEOPLE INDOORS OVER AND OVER AGAIN SAYS YOU'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS FROM THE STATE LEVEL I WANT. THAT HELP TO BUILD MORE ROOMS WITH DOORS OR BY MORE ROOMS WITH DOORS THAT WE CAN OFFER TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THAT GETS US TO YES. OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF FROM OUR OFFICE. BUT WHICH I THINK DOESN'T HAPPEN A CRAW THE CITY FOR. THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT. WHAT HASN'T WORKED- IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING INTO FACILITIES WHETHER IT BE PRK WHETHER IT BE. OTHER KINDS OF INTERIM HOUSING FACILITIES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET PEOPLE IN THOSE HOMES TRANSITION INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE STAFF TO DO THE FOLLOW UP. FIVE ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE I BELIEVE ON MY STAFF I HAVE A HOMELESSNESS TEAM OF THREE AND A HALF RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S A PRETTY BIG INVESTMENT IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE COORDINATION WORK. AND OUR COUNCIL DISTRICT LEVEL GIVE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE COUNCIL DISTRICTS I DON'T THINK THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER. BUT IT'S STILL IT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT I THINK IS MORE THAN MANY OTHER COUNCIL DISTRICTS ARE MAKING. AND BECAUSE WE'RE DOING THE FOLLOW UP WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HOUSE. TO SAY HEY ARE YOU MOVING TO THAT NEXT STEP. WE'RE ABLE TO THEN ASK FOR THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE OT JUST INTO INTERIM HOUSING. BUT THEN TO MAKE THE TRANSITION INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. AND HEIDI KNOWS BECAUSE I'VE CALLED HER MANY TIMES TO BUG ER FOR THOSE RESOURCES- FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HASN'T WORKED- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GAPS IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- AND I THINK FUNDING CAN HELP ELIMINATE SOME OF THOSE GAPS I JUST WANNA TALK ABOUT IT. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING TO GET SOMEONE HELP. SO THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR STREETS IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT STREETS. WHO ARE VERY VERY SICK. AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT THEY ARE NOT SICK ENOUGH FOR OUR DMH- PRIMARY STREET BASED OUTREACH TEAM WHICH IS OUR HOME TEAM. TO GO OUT AND HELP THEM. SO THEY LITERALLY HAVE TO WAIT. UNTIL THEY ARE NEAR DEATH. FOR OUR DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND SERVE THEM. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS AND IT IS HUMILIATING. FOR OUR CITY TO BE IN THAT POSITION. AND I THINK THE MORE THAT WE CAN FUNDED SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS INCLUDING. STREET BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. STRUGGLING BUT- WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES CAN NAVIGATE INTO HOUSING AND CARE. BEFORE THEY GET SO SICK THA THEY ARE DYING. WE DESPERATELY NEED THAT AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. SIMILARLY I WOULD SAY THE SAME FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE RESOURCES RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING AN EXPLOSION OF MATH ON OUR STREETS. CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS HAVE CHANGED. SUCH THAT WHAT PEOPLE ARE USING IS AFFECTING THEM IN WAYS THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE JUST MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. PEOPLE ARE SICKER. ON THE STREETS AND I HAVE SEEN THEM BEFORE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE DRUGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. WE NEED RESOURCES. FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE WE NEED THEM DESPERATELY. AND THERE WAS A VERY EXCITING BILL A PUT FORWARD BY SENATOR SCOTT WIENER. ABOUT INCH SAFE INJECTION SITES WHICH DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE STATE. ANY EVIDENCE BASED RESPONSE TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND RECOVERY THAT YOU CAN FIND WE DESPERATELY NEED IT. TO RESPOND TO A CRISIS THAT IS GROWING- AND NEEDS NEEDS HELP URGENTLY. FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE THING THAT REALLY DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. WHICH IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A COORDINATED STRATEGY AT THE CITY FOR RESPONDING TO HOMELESSNESS. EACH COUNCIL DISTRICT GOES ITS OWN WAY- AND I THINK THAT HAPPENS IN THE COUNTY WITH ALL OF OUR CITIES SO I THINK IT'S A PARALLEL PROBLEM MAYBE IT HAPPENS AT THE STATE LEVEL. SURE AND AT THE CITY LEVEL THAT PROBLEM IS EVEN MORE ACUTE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE CHARGED WITH FINDING LAND FOR INTERIM HOUSING. THE PEOPLE CHARGED WITH FINDING LAND FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ARE ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO WILL SUFFER THE MOST. SEVERE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR FINDING THAT HOUSING AND BUILDING THAT HOUSING. EVERY TIME I PUT FORWARD A SITE. FOR ANY ANY KIND OF CONSTRUCTION. WHETHER EVEN IF IT'S JUST A DROP IN CENTER. A ONCE A WEEK I GET A BUNCH OF CALLS COMPLAINING ABOUT IT. AND SO IT IS A DISINCENTIVE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH I. REALLY WANT TO DO IT I BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S NEEDED FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS OUR OUR ISSUES. WE KNOW OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WE CAN'T ARREST OR SWEEP OUR WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS THE ONLY WAY TO SUSTAINABLY ENDING HOMELESSNESS IS TO GET PEOPLE INTO HOUSING. IT TAKES TIME IT TAKES PATIENCE AND YET THE PERSON WHO IS CHARGED WITH MAKING SURE THAT THAT PROCESS HAPPENS SUSTAINABLY HAPPENS SAFELY HAPPENS COMPASSIONATELY HAPPENS EFFECTIVELY THAT'S ME. I'M ALSO THE PERSON WHO GETS THE MOST PHONE CALLS. ABOUT ASKING PEOPLE TO BE MOVED IMMEDIATELY FROM HOUSE RESIDENTS WERE UNDERSTANDABLY. AND I HAVE A LOT OF EMPATHY FOR HOUSE AND HOUSE RESIDENTS IN THIS CASE THEY'RE UNDERSTANDABLY IMPATIENT. AND FRUSTRATED WITH OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THESE ISSUES. WE NEED. CENTRALIZATION WE NEED DECISION MAKING ABOUT HOUSING AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO SITE HOUSING WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS HOUSING. THAT IS NOT BEING MADE AT THE COUNCIL DISTRICT LEVEL I KNOW THAT'S WEIRD FOR ME TO SAY I DON'T WANT THAT- BUT I THINK FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR CITY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE EFFECTIVELY. IT HAS TO BE DONE IN A CENTRALIZED WAY AT THE CITY- IT HAS TO BE DONE AT THE CENTRALIZED WITH THE COUNTY- AND IT HAS TO BE SUPERCHARGED- AND I KNOW THE STATE HAS BEEN DOING A LOT ON HOUSING CONSTRUCTION- AND KIND OF EASING. PADS FOR HOUSING BEING BUILT- IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. BUT I THINK THE STRATEGY NEEDS TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL. AND IT NEEDS TO BE MORE COORDINATED TOWARD ADDRESSING OUR GREATEST NEEDS WHETHER IT BE GEOGRAPHICALLY FOCUSED WHETHER IT BE FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR KIND OF HOUSING IT'S PIECE MEAL RIGHT NOW. THEY WERE ALL GOING TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WE REALLY NEED. DIRECTION SO WITH THAT ALL ALL CLOSER. THANK YOU AGAIN AND THANK YOU FOR THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO. BEING SELF CRITICAL AND CRITICAL OF ALL- AREAS SO I MUST GET STUCK ON THE EVERY NOW AND THEN- THIS PERSON IF YOU WANT- REDUCE THE OWNER PLEASE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME HEIDI MARSTON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LHASA I WE ARE THE COORDINATING AGENCY BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY AND THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND HOMELESSNESS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY I JUST A FEW THINGS THAT I WANT TO SHARE AND A LOT OF IT IS REALLY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY TODAY FROM PANELISTS BUT- DESPITE WHAT WE SEE ON OUR STREETS AND THE TRAGEDY THAT WE SEE IN THE CRISIS THAT WE SEE. ARE HOMELESS THREE HOUSING SYSTEM IS STILL HOUSING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND WE'VE HEARD TODAY A NUMBER OF TIMES OUR LAST HOMELESS COUNT SHOWED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND JUST TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS OUR SYSTEM HAS HOUSED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SO IT REALLY EMPHASIZES FOR US WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH PEOPLE COMING INTO HOMELESSNESS AND THE NEED TO STOP PEOPLE FROM FALLING IN. WHEN WE BREAK THAT DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER OUT WITH OUR TWENTY TWENTY NUMBERS IT LOOKS LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE PEOPLE BEING PLACED INTO PERMANENT HOUSING EVERY SINGLE DAY ACROSS THE COUNTY. AND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS EVERY SINGLE DAY IN L. A. COUNTY SO WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO TURN OFF THE FAUCET AND AT ALL COSTS KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. WE ALSO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO CENTER ON THE TRUTH THAT I'VE HEARD HERE TODAY ACROSS THE BOARD IS THAT BEING ON HOUSE IN AMERICA BEING ON HOUSE IN LA IS NOT. A CHARACTER FLAW AND IT'S NOT AN INDIVIDUAL SHORTCOMINGS. BUT IT'S A DIRECT ESULT OF THE SYSTEM AND POLICY FAILURES THAT HAVE LED TO WHERE WE ARE. AND THE VALLEY BUSINESS COUNCIL PAUL THAT A LOT OF YOU HAVE MENTIONED TODAY IT SHOWED THAT ANGELENOS UNDERSTAND THAT INTUITIVELY. BUT 94% OF THE RESIDENTS IDENTIFIED HOMELESSNESS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. AND 86% OF THOSE PEOPLE SAID THAT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY WAS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR. AND SO ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY THAT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DESIGN SYSTEMS THAT AND HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE WE DESIGN THE SYSTEMS THA BECAUSE HOMELESSNESS. SO WHAT I WANNA DO BRIEFLY IS TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S WORKING AND IT LOS ANGELES AN ACROSS THE BOARD. AND REITERATING WHAT YOU'VE HEARD HERE TODAY AT FULLY IN SUPPORT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A BALANCED SYSTEM WE NEED A WAY ESPECIALLY REGION OF LIKE LA TO FAST QUICKLY GET PEOPLE OFF OF THE STREET AND INTO SHELTER- WE NEED TO CREATE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WE NEED TO HAVE OPTIONS FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. AND WHILE THE COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC BROUGHT US TREMENDOUS STRATEGY TRAGEDY SUFFERING LOSS OF LIVES WE DID SEE A GLIMMER OF HOPE AND IT SPEAKS A LOT OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IS THAT. COVER NINETEEN DIDN'T ONLY GIVE US THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS HOMELESSNESS CRISIS FROM THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE LEVEL IT GAVE US THE WILL. AND IT GAVE US THIS EMERGENCY RESPONSE I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR A REALLY LONG TIME WITH THIS CRISIS. AND IT BECAUSE OF SUPPORT FROM THE STATE IN COORDINATION WITH LASSA AT THE LA CITIES L. A. COUNTY OUR COMMUNITY REALLY CAME TOGETHER AND WE SAT A COLLECTIVE TARGET AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND SAID OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS TO GET PEOPLE INSIDE. WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SHELTERING IN PLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SO IN A MATTER OF WEEKS OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS BROUGHT THIRTY HOTELS AND MOTELS ONLINE THROUGH PROJECT ROOM HE- AND THIS FEMA BASS COVE IT RESPONSE THAT REALLY ALLOWED CITIES AND COUNTIES AND STATES TO BE REIMBURSED. AND TO HAVE A WAY FORWARD. AND AT ITS PEAK IN LA THERE WERE THIRTY SEVEN PROJECT ROOM KEY SITES WITH ABOUT THIRTY SIX HUNDRED ROOMS WHICH IS MORE THAN ANY OTHER REGION IN THE COUNTRY. AND SO APPEAR K. REALLY TAUGHT US IS THAT WHEN WE ALL COME TOGETHER AT ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ACROSS DONDE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES ACROSS NONPROFIT. AND WE ALIGNED WITH A COMMON GOAL AND WE ALIGN OUR RESOURCES WE CAN MOVE FASTER THAN WE EVER THOUGHT WE COULD WE SURPRISED OURSELVES AND HOW QUICKLY WE ARE ABLE TO BRING PROJECT ROOM. ONLINE BUT IT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE ALL LINED ON A VISION AND I THINK THAT WE CAN DO THAT AGAIN AND BUILD HAT MOMENTUM. AND LIKE YOU'VE HEARD IT PROJECT ROOM HE ALSO REINFORCE THE THINGS WE KNEW ABOUT SHELTER AND NEW WAYS THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SHELTER. WHICH IS THIS NON CONGREGATE DIGNIFIED SPACES THAT HAS A DOOR THAT LOCKS THAT HAVE A BATHROOM. AND LET'S PEOPLE COME INSIDE AND HAVE A PRIVATE PLACE TO STAY WITH DIGNITY. AND THAT'S WHY PROJECT ROOM HE HAS REMAINED FULL- IT'S WHY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO COME IN TO SHELTER BEFORE WERE NOT HAS A TEN AND WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WAITING TO GET IN THE PROJECT ROOM KEY. BUT SINCE THE BEGINNING A PROJECT ROOM KEY AND THE BEGINNING OF COALBED SO FAR WE'VE SERVE NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND OUR PROJECT ROOM KEY SITES. AND THE REAL SUCCESS TO ME IS NOT ONLY HOW MANY WE BROUGHT INSIDE. BUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INSIDE ARE NOT RETURNING TO THE STREETS AT THE RATE WE SEE IN OUR CONGREGATE SITES SO LESS THAN 10% OF PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO THE STREET. AND SO FAR SO FAR IT'S NOT OVER YET BUT FROM PROJECT ROOM KEY INTO PERMANENT HOUSING BECAUSE WERE ABLE TO CENTRALIZE OUR HOUSING RESOURCES. RABAL TO CENTRALIZE OUR DOCUMENTATION SPECIALIST AND ALL OF OUR CASE MANAGEMENT ON SITE. TO GET PEOPLE INDOORS. IF SO I WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER SHELTER OR HOUSING WORKS BETTER IT'S NOT EITHER OR SHELTER WORKS BEST WHEN WE HAVE HOUSING RESOURCES THAT WE CAN ATTACH TO IT WE NEED SHELTER TO GET FOLKS OFF THE STREET BUT WITHOUT THE PERMANENT HOUSING RESOURCES ON THE OTHER END PEOPLE WILL STAY IN SHELTER AND WE SEE LENGTH OF STAY IN SHELTER ACTUALLY INCREASING RIGHT NOW ONE TO TWO YEARS EVEN THE PEOPLE ARE STAYING WAITING FOR THAT HOUSING OPTION ON THE BACK AND- SO IT SHELTERS PREVENT PEOPLE FROM SUFFERING OUTDOORS. AND HOUSING WILL MAKE THE SHELTER SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT SO IT'S ABOUT THE END- AND I'LL JUST END BY SAYING IT THAT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT PERMANENT HOUSING WE TALK ABOUT THE COST OF PERMANENT HOUSING. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BUILDING NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT THE ONLY PIECE THAT WERE LOOKING OUT WE'RE ALSO USING RENTAL SUBSIDIES THAT REPRESENT ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR HOUSING PLACEMENTS. WHERE WE HAVE CHALLENGES THERE IS MAKING THOSE RENTAL SUBSIDIES COMPETITIVE IN OUR MARKET- THAT YOU'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER THE COST OF LIVING IS ASTRONOMICAL. AND JUST FROM A WESTERN REGION PERSPECTIVE THIS ISN'T EVEN L. A. ALONE BUT ACROSS THE ENTIRE WESTERN SIDE OF THE U. S. THERE ARE THIRTY AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS THAT NEED THEM. SO IT'S LIKE A REALLY BAD GAME OF MUSIC MUSICAL CHAIRS ACROSS THE WEST COAST I WOULD SAY PROBABLY EVEN WORSE IN LA- THAT IS THE WEST COAST BUT A BAD GAME OF MUSICAL CHAIRS THAT LEAVES THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. OUT ON THE STREET WITHOUT AN OPTION TO RESOLVE THEIR HOMELESSNESS. SO WHAT WE NEED TO SEE FROM THE STATE IF THE CONTINUING OF BUILDING ON THESE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS LIKE YOU DID MAKING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET- AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE INVESTMENTS IN PROJECT HOME HE- AND THERE ARE HUGE LEAP FORWARD AND WE WANT TO BUILD ON THAT. THE BILLION DOLLAR STATE INVESTMENT AND HAPPY THIS YEAR- AND IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR IS REALLY CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MOVE PEOPLE OFF THE STREET WITH RENTAL SUBSIDIES IN CASE MANAGEMENT- BUT- AS YOU'VE HEARD CONSISTENCY IS. THE KEY AT WE REALLY NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE MAKING FUNDING PERMANENT SO WE CAN ENSURE SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE THE PREDICTABILITY AND THE STABILITY OF RESOURCE THING THEY NEED TO SCALE UP. THEIR SERVICES AND KEEP THEM GOING. THE STATE BEGAN FUNDING FLEXIBLE FLEXIBLE FUNDING FOR LOCAL PROVIDERS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET YEAR AND THAT. THE PROGRAM HAS CHANGED EVERY YEAR SINCE THEN. AND JUST I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN ANOTHER CONTACT THAT WE WOULD NEVER EXPECT TO SET A SUCCESS FROM OUR SCHOOLS ARE K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL SYSTEM. IF THEY HAD TO GO TO SACRAMENTO EVERY YEAR TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE NEEDED FUNDING TO CONTINUE THEIR PROGRAMS. AND WE SHOULD TAKE THE SAME APPROACH AROUND HOMELESS SERVICES BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE THE RISK OF A CLIFF AT EVERY YEAR. AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIR SANTIAGO FOR BRINGING THIS HEARING TOGETHER ADAM AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR FOR YOUR HONEST COMMENTS- LET ME JUMP OVER THE COMMITTEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS HERE. I'M SORRY MR GIPSON AYE HE- I'M SORRY. SO IT'S IT IS QUITE ALRIGHT- I WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE- COMMITTEE- THAT'S BEFORE US IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE AND I DID DEFERRED TO- MOVE THE AGENDA LONG BUT I MUST WEIGH IN A JUST FOR THE SAKE OF MY TIMES I HAVE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT THANK THE ROBUST CONVERSATION. HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU SAY WE NEED TO INVEST TO RADIC KATE THIS ISSUE THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHTS AROUND- A STATE Y. COORDINATES BECAUSE WHAT I HEARD WAS THAT THERE IS NO REAL COORDINATION AND- WE NEED TO BRING EVERYONE AND UMBRELLA WHO RECEIVED FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL MONEY. TO COME TOGETHER TO HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION TO CREATE A BIGGER PLAN SO THAT'S THE SECOND QUESTION AND THE THIRD AND FINAL QUESTION I HAVE RONALD REAGAN REALLY SCREWED UP WHEN HE- DISMANTLED- MENTAL SERVICES SO WHAT IS YOUR IDEAL BECAUSE MY TEAM'S RESEARCH OR RESEARCH HAS RESEARCHED ON THIS ISSUE AND WE MAY BE PROVIDING A BILL THAT WOULD REINSTITUTE MENTAL INSTITUTION. SO HOW WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE AGAIN I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS SPEND I WOULD HOMELESS PEOPLE AND I SAID THAT BEFORE SUPERVISOR- YOU GOT HERE I SPEND THE NIGHT WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE EVERY YEAR I DIDN'T DO IT IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC AND THEN I HAVE A GOD SON WHO'S HOMELESS ON CRYSTAL METH. BUT MY- SPEND IT I WOULD HOMELESS PEOPLE HAVE UNCOVERED THAT ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG WHO CAN'T MAKE RATIONAL DECISIONS SO THEREFORE THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BECOME CONSERVATIVES OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK ABOUT NORM NUMBER QUESTIONS THERE HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK ARE HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS. BECAUSE WE CAN STILL TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE BUT WE CANNOT FORCE THEM INTO PERMANENT. OR TEMPORARY HOUSING IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE THESE IN. ARE DOES I BASS A LOT OF THOUGH TAKE A STAB AT IT- I JUST WANTED PUTPROVIDE ONE COMMENT TO THAT LAST PIECE AROUND MENTAL ILLNESS AND I CAN'T TAKE THIS OUT AND I MIGHT JUST JUMP IN AND ASK EVERYBODY TO JUST STORE OWNER COMMENTED IT'S MY FAULT OR LITTLE BIT BEHIND THERE SO. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT SOMETIMES I THINK TH QUESTION AROUND MENTAL ILLNESS RESPONSES TO MENTAL ILLNESS GET OVERWHELMED BY THE QUESTION OF CONSERVATORSHIP BECAUSE EVEN IF WE CHANGE LAWS RUN CONSERVATORSHIP IT WOULD REALLY ONLY IMPACT A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS OKAY AND THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WE NEED IS MORE RESOURCES TO SERVE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BOTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS BEFORE THEY BECOME HOMELESS LIKE THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO DOLLARS WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GET SO SICK WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT CONSERVATORSHIP AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO FOCUS MY CONVERSATION AND I IN RESPONSE TO THAT TO THE TO YOUR QUESTION AROUND HOW DO WE DESIGN PROGRAMS THAT WORK- YOU KNOW I WANT TO LEARN FROM THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION AND REENTRY. THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN CREATING COMMUNITY BASED CARE RESPONSES IN L. A. COUNTY WHAT HAVE THEY LEARNED LET'S TAKE THAT AND APPLY IT AT THE STATE LEVEL EXPAND THAT INVESTMENT AND MAKE IT BETTER YOU KNOW. IF THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COUNCILMEMBER UP MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS IS CAN BE A COSTLY ITEM FOR ANY COUNTY OR OR STATE AND WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STRINGS ATTACHED TO ACUITY SO YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY DEFELICE SICK MENTALLY SICK BEFORE WE CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE YOU THE SPACE THE BED AND ALL OF THAT WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THAT NEED THE PREVENTION AND WE NEED TO HAVE TWO PARALLELS ONE IS YES MORE STABILIZED. REFORM AND ASSISTANCE FOR MENTALLY HELD THAT ARE EXTREMELY ACUTE AND THEN YOU NEED THE OTHER MAYBE TWO OTHER STAGES ONE IS WHERE YOU CAN HELP DIED GIVE THEM A DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT BECAUSE MANY OF THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET AREN'T ALL MENTALLY ILL THEY FACE TRAUMA RAPE HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND THEN A CARCERAL SYSTEM THAT HAS NOT BEEN GOOD FOR THEM AND SOMETIMES OUR OWN INSTITUTIONS MAKE PEOPLE POOR AND THEY END UP IN THE STREET IN THAT MANNER SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH DIFFERENT LENSES AND I DO BELIEVE IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE FOR YOU ALL TO SPEAK WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR DR JOHN SHARON. WHO HAS A LENGTHY OF EXPERIENCE WORKING AT DIFFERENT LEVELS ON HOW WE ADDRESS THIS AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW IF WE COULD SOMEHOW GET MEDICAID MEDICARE MONEY IN TO HELP REIMBURSE OUR TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH EVEN IF IT'S TEAMS GOING OUT ON THE STREET THAT WILL HELP REDUCE COSTS BUT WE'RE NOT DOING IT SO WE DO HAVE TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGED HERE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU. AND THEN OVERALL I THINK MAYBE HEIDI YOU CAN TALK ABOUT I WOULD JUST SAY THREE THINGS THAT COULD REALLY HELP MOVE THE NEEDLE ONE OUT HERE IN LA EVERY YEAR WE DO A GAP ANALYSIS THAT LOOKS AT WHAT IS THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHAT ARE THEIR NEEDS AND WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND WHAT'S THE DELTA BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE AND WHAT WE NEED DOING OUT OF THE STATE LIGHT WIDE LEVEL IS SO NEEDED ACROSS THIS THEY TO TELL. WHAT'S THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE DOING WHAT IS OUR POPULATION LOOK LIKE AND LET'S IDENTIFY THE GAP BETWEEN. THAT WILL HELP US FIGURE OUT THE COST AND WHERE TO PUT THE COST. THE SECOND PIECE THAT I THINK OFTEN GETS LOST IN ALL THIS IS ALL OF THE MONEY IN THE WORLD WON'T RESOLVE THE ISSUE AND LESS WE LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE AND HOW HARD WE MAKE IT FOR PEOPLE. TO GET INTO HOUSING ENOUGH NOT TO STATE IF SOCIAL SECURITY IT DO IT IF ACROSS THE BOARD. OKAY SO HOW DO WE BREAK THROUGH TAT RED TAPE WHILE WE INVEST IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM SO WE REALLY BUILD THE MOMENTUM. AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE IS CONTROLLING THE AFFORDABILITY IN THE ECONOMICS AT SCALE YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE US CAN YOU AFFORD A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT ON MINIMUM WAGE. SO THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE PUSHING ON SO THAT WERE BRINGING THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONLINE WHILE WE LOOK AT TACKLING THE EXISTING CRISIS. AND REMOVING THOSE BARRIERS AND I'M GOING TO MOVE THE STUFF THE LONG BEFORE WE START LOSING TO SPEAKERS THAT WE SPENT. THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S ROBUST LIKE. I THINK YOU HAVE. BUT I WILL BE THE SECOND PERSON PRIVILEGES WHICH WHICH IS. ACTUALLY RIGHT IF WE HAD ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD WE STILL. AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING WE STILL WANT SALAS WITH TALK ABOUT FROM VICIOUS YOU WHAT WORKS AND WHAT WE DID CUT- PI DISAGREE WITH YOU THERE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE COULD DO SOMETHING STATEWIDE BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE SO BIG. THEY GET THE FOCUS REGIONALLY. ON ON ON SPOTS HERE. AND SOME OF IT IS LAND USE DECISIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT IS YOUR LOS ANGLES MAY MAYBE BETTER. IN TERMS OF BUILDING HOUSING IS STILL FAR FAR FAR BEYOND LACKS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION BUT IT'S ABOUT MODERATE RATE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY AND ANSWER YOU COULD CORRECT ME. BUT BUT I THINK IT'S SEVEN FIVE THOUSAND UNITS BUILT ABOVE MARKET RATE WELL IT'S ONLY DEVELOP WHEN IT WHEN IT HAS A DEFICIT OF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND- UNITS BUILT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THAT FIGHT IN THE LOW IN. A LOW INCOME SO THERE'S SOMETHING DETRIMENTALLY WRONG WITH THAT PIECE TO THAT BUT THE MORE DEVELOPING OUT OF THE MORE YOU'RE PUSHING PEOPLE INTO THE STREETS- BUT PATHETIC BUT THAT EVEN. BUT EVEN. IS MUCH BETTER THAN. THAN THE READ IN TERMS HOUSING OR EVEN THIS. IN TERMS OF HOUSING YEAH. SO THERE'S A JOINT- RESPONSIBILITY BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL. BUT THE STATE DOESN'T REALLY MAKE LAND USE DECISIONS. WE LEGISLATE ON BUT BUT- BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO NECESSARILY DO THAT YOURSELF I THINK LOOK I I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU- I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT BALANCE IS TO TRY TO FIX THAT. CAN BE ALMOST GO BACK THE ORIGINAL THING THAT I SET- WHICH IS ROLE. ROLE IN THIS TOGETHER WITHOUT A FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO IT I REALLY APPRECIATE. AND I REALLY DO MEAN THAT THE VERY CANDID CONVERSATION BACK AND FORTH. ABOUT THIS. I VIOLATED MY OWN THING ABOUT US IN THE COMMENTS SO I'M GONNA GO HERE AND THEN I'M GONNA MOVE THE NEXT. OKAY WITH EVERYONE. I JUST GOT. JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE I THINK A QUICK OPTION BUT IT IS OBVIOUS. IS THERE ANY. IS THERE THERE'S A LOT OF PALS ARE GOING AFTER THIS. DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO LET US GO TO THE SECOND MORE AND BE HONEST WITH YOUR- BILL. DO YOU. YEAH I'M UNLESS I HEAR A THUMBS DOWN. THIS IS NOT SET I'M GONNA GO VERY QUICKLY AND IF THERE'S ANYBODY LIKE TIME CONSTRAINTS ON MOVE THEM AHEAD RIGHT SO GO AHEAD BUT A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE DISCUSSION FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY- SUPERVISOR YOU CAN ASK MISTER KRAFT- JUST TO THIS PLACE THE OTHER DAY WE GIVEN. LAST NUMBER YEARS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR PETS IT'S BEEN A BIG PROGRAM FOR US IN THE STATE. SECOND ALL OF THE SNOW. AND WE CAN'T IGNORE THAT CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT IS EVERYTHING. PEOPLE WROTE CHECKS OF THE CITY AND THE COUNTY LEVEL BECAUSE THEY SOLVE PROBLEMS AND THEY WANT TO DO TO FIX IT WE ARE AT INFLECTION POINT FOR THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO TALK ABOUT. PEOPLE ARE SO ANGRY. IT'S THE RATIONAL ISSUE. SO ALL OF THESE EFFORTS ARE INTERESTING BUT I THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS THE POINT THAT YOU MADE IT YOU BUILD SOMETHING FOR SIX MONTHS DOWNTOWN FORTY SIX YEARS OF THE CONTROLLER TALK ABOUT A HAPPENING PEOPLE WILL NOT HAVE PATIENCE FOR THAT CAN CRAFT WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT HE'S DOING IN THE BALLOT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ALL IN A COPY BUILDING STUFF IN NINETY DAYS. YOU KNOW THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS IN THE ARCHITECTURE OF OUR PUBLIC POLICY DEBATE I HAVE TO BE CRITICAL AND- COUNCILMEMBER ROBERT LIKE TO KNOW FROM A DATA PERSPECTIVE TAKING THE GUIDANCE FROM US SECRETARY ELLEN YOU NOW HAVE TAKEN THIS OUTREACH EFFORT YOU'VE TAKEN PEOPLE FROM YOUR STAFF TO REACH AND DO THIS STUFF WHAT IS THE OUTCOME OF THAT HAVE YOU IMPROVED THE IMPACT. YOU KNOW CAN YOU SHARE IT WITH US BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE MAYBE THOSE ARE TOOLS THAT WE COULD ENGAGE IN TO FURTHER FUND WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEEN THE IMPACT IF YOU'VE DONE THE FOLLOW UP SO THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT. ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS THERE'S NO EXCUSES WON'T HAPPEN IF PEOPLE HAVE THE PATIENCE. YOU KNOW THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR A WORKING WITH US ON THIS I KNOW THAT I'M RUNNING A LITTLE BIT AND I'M AT FAULT BUT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU AND SO- I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT COORDINATION AND BRINGING THINGS TOGETHER. AND I'VE SEEN IT WORK. I'VE SEEN IT WORK. BOB IN MY DISTRICT ARE USE- SUPERVISOR LISA MY STAFF. THAT THE S. J. S. S. THE SO LEAST JONES SAWYER STAFF. THEY WORK WELL TOGETHER IN FACT. THE SUPERVISOR AND I PROBABLY NEVER HAVE TO GET ON A PHONE CALL. BECAUSE OUR STAFFS. HANDLE THE PROBLEMS IN THE DISTRICT. AND THEN. AND MAKE SURE THAT THINGS GET DONE. THIS SILO BEING THAT WE HAVE THAT YOU ALL DOING MARVELOUS THINGS IN YOUR PREFERRED RESPECTIVE SILOS THE SUGGESTION I WANNA GIVE IS- I'LL ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT ONE PERSON NEEDS TO BE IN CHARGE THERE IS NO ONE PERSON IN CHARGE NO DISRESPECT TO LHASA BECAUSE I REMEMBER WHY WE'RE FOR WRITTEN WHEN THEY STARTED LASSEN THAT WAS KIND OF THE IDEA AND WE NEVER REALLY EMPOWER LHASA TO DO THAT- AND SO WHETHER OR NOT. WE HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME WHETHER OR NOT I KIND OF DISAGREE WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE STATE MAY HAVE TO HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE SKIN IN THE GAME MAY WE HAVE A STATE HOMELESS CZAR THAT CAN PULL TOGETHER ALL THE RESOURCES IN THE INDIVIDUAL- COUNTIES AND CITIES TO MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE AND ADD ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND SO IF THAT IS SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE ONLY CAVEAT I WOULD GIVE YOU IS THAT PERSON THAT WE PUT IN CHARGE MIGHT LOOK A LOT LIKE BOB HERTZBERG. SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR. IT ON THE WHEN YOU PLAY THE SUPER. WITH THE BUT WHEN I WHEN I. WHEN I MET. DO NOT IT AT THE STATE WIDE BASIS I MEAN HAVING A POINT PERSON AS- BASIS. BUT IT BUT NUMBERS AT A STATEWIDE BASIS THE TELETHON JUST MAKING THEM AROUND RIGHT. YOU KNOW HUNDRED THIS HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS DOESN'T HELP DOESN'T HELP WITH THE PAIN POINT TO KIND OF FOCUS GROUPS YOU NEED. COULD ONLY SOLVE HOMELESSNESS. ET OR HELP PEOPLE IN THE IN THE SHELTER IN AND I'VE WE'VE DONE IT OURSELVES TO AN R. AND- IN THE OVERLAP WITH OUR AREA. I DO AGREE WITH MISS RAMAN THAT THAT YOU HAVE TO PICK THAT HOT SPOT YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING BACK TO THAT HOT SPOT THAT. CORNER THAT THAT CORNER OFTEN OFFRAMP AND THEN YOU GET THAT PROBLEM SOLVED BECAUSE YOUR YOUR TAKES D. O. T. IT TAKES CALTRANS IT TAKES. LHASA IT TAKES THE CITY COORDINATION TEAM TO TAKE THE STATE TO TAKE ALL THESE ENTITIES. BUT IT'S ALL THESE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THAT THAT GO TO THAT ONE PARTICULAR HOT SPOT AND THEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY WILL WILL ACCEPT- THAT THAT SORT OF HOUSING. WHICH IS A DIFFERENT TO BE TO HAVE RIGHT BECAUSE THEN WE SPENT. BUT TO SAY THAT WE SPEND ALL THIS MONEY WE HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE WORKING ON IT. AND THEN THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING RESULT OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE CORNER HELPING TO SOMEBODY GET OFF ON THE FLOOR YOU GOTTA WONDER WHAT US FOR THE REST OF THE STUFF IS DOING RIGHT. OR HOW MUCH HAVE HAS TO BE RE CHANGED TO RE DONE. WHEN PEOPLE ON. THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND ARE ACTUALLY HELPING PUT THIS PERSON. IN THE HOUSING. THAT WHAT THE REST OF THIS. DOING THAT WE NEED EXAM INCLUDING ON OUR SIDE. AND THAT'S FAIR. THIS ORDER OF LU&lt;c.cyan&gt;. SORRY AT THE END OF THE&lt;/c&gt; DAY. IT'S NOT LEGISLATION IS IMPLEMENTATION. THAT'S OUR PROBLEM. OR CERTAIN MISTER BUT WHATEVER IT IS IT WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE WANT TO CALL BUT YET- ANYONE ELSE. I THOUGHT I SAW YOUR HAND OKAY SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION THANK YOU. AND I APOLOGIZE TO EVERYBODY WHO WERE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LATE ON. I'D ARE WE READY GO THE NEXT MR HERE I'LL JUST APOLOGISE NOW I HAVE TO LEAVE PROMPTLY AT TWELVE THIRTY SO- I DON'T WANT TO DISRUPT THAT LIBERALS. SURE ENOUGH NOW WE HAVE A MISTER SANTANA THE STRUGGLE AS A AND THIS TURK AND MISTER CAN CRAFT AND MISTER COULD YOU. ALSO TAKE THE SECOND ITSELF A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CENTER. THANK YOU. AND- OKAY. IF THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHEN IT. AND MR SANTANA YOU MAY BEGIN WHATEVER YOU EAT- WHENEVER YOU'D LIKE INSIDE RUSSIA EVERYBODY I. REPORTER WELL YEAH WELL THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT HIM IN RIGHT I MEAN WE BROUGHT HIM IN BECAUSE HE TO REPORT THAT THAT- PROBABLY TO GET THE ATTENTION IT SHOULD AND SO THIS IS JUST A SPARK TO TRY TO BRING THAT BACK UP TO CONVERSATION I'M ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT JUST TO SHOW WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THAT GRAPH THAT YOU THAT I'VE READ THROUGH ON THE REPORT THAT YOU DID THAT SHOWS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWELVE AND- TEN ENTITIES GIVING. GIVING DIRECTION TO LHASA. JUST HOLD UP FOR WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THAT- I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A- I HAVE A- I HAVE A REPORTS BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL OF YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ME GET SOME OF THAT- I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO THE WEINGART FOUNDATION. I ALSO SERVED- MOST OF MY CAREER IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR BOTH AT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES- I CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE FOR GREATER LOS ANGELES WHICH WAS A COMMITTEE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED- DURING THE PANDEMIC. TO LOOK AT OUR SYSTEMIC ISSUES- IN A VARIETY OF ISSUES. AND PROPOSE. A SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS TO ISSUES. THAT REALLY BUT WERE EXPOSED DURING THIS CRISIS. AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO GREATER ISSUE THAT MANIFESTS. THAT SYSTEMIC FAILURES OF ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS AND HOMELESSNESS. THERE ARE THREE BASIC THINGS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE TODAY AND WIDELY IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE AND- I THOUGHT GUY- THERE WERE SIGNS UP BUT I WANTED TO GIVE IT TO YOU SO YOU COULD. ANSWER I. ISAAC. WITH THE ASSISTANCE MIGHT THE CARDIO. I THINK A LITTLE. YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY IS THAT THERE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT OF A PASSION OF COMMITMENT FROM EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL EVERY DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBLE AND EVEN FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS AND VOLUNTEERS. WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AROUND THIS CRISIS. VOTERS HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOS ANGELES AND YET THE QUESTION I GET ASKED ALL THE TIME AS AS WELL AS YOU IS WHY IS IT THAT THE PROBLEM LOOKS TO BE GETTING WORSE. SO TO BE CLEAR THERE ARE NO VILLAINS HERE. THERE'S NOT SOMEONE WHO'S NOT EXERCISING LEADERSHIP IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE NOT INNOVATING IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING HARD. IT'S THE FACT THAT ALL OF THESE EFFORTS AS AS AS THE CHAIRMAN POINTED OUT. ARE BEING DONE IN ISOLATION. WOULD YOU HEARD TODAY FROM- COUNCILWOMAN ROBIN ABOUT HOW SHE- IS PERSONALLY IN CHARGE OF FOR THE ENCAMPMENTS AND UNDER DISTRICT. NOW WHEN SHE SIGNED UP TO BE A COUNCILWOMAN I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO BE DOING. THAT SHE GETS TO THAT SIDE WITCHING CAP MEN'S GET GET DEALT WITH HOW THEY GET DEALT WITH WHO SHE PARTNERS WITH WHO GETS PRIORITIZED INTO THE CAMP IT'S LITERALLY WHICH HUMAN BEINGS GET SELECTED. HER STAFF ARE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING AND COORDINATING ALL OF THE SERVICES. AND SO WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS BEING LED BY INDIVIDUALS WHO CARE A LOT. BUT IS NOT BEING LED BY A SYSTEM WHO THAT'S ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT'S IN AND VERY IMPORTANT THING TO EMPHASIZE. IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE A WE HAVE A BROKEN SYSTEM IS THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM WORK IN THEIR OWN EFFORTS. WITH AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE BETWEEN AGENCIES IT'S WHAT WE GET THINGS DONE BUT IT'S NOT DONE ON IT INSTITUTIONAL BASIS. AND SO DESPITE ALL OF OUR BEST THINKING DESPITE THISIN ON PRESIDENT. WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO TURN THIS AROUND UNLESS THERE IS SOME COORDINATED ACCOUNTABILITY. NOT JUST TODAY BUT FOREVER. HOMELESSNESS IS NOT A TEMPORARY PROBLEM IT'S A FOR A FOREVER PROBLEM. AND THEN I THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE HAVING WORKED ON IT FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER. THAT WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH ULTIMATELY WHAT THE SOLUTION IS. TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE WHEN THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT EVERY PERSON SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO A PUBLIC EDUCATION. ARE THERE WAS AN IDEA AFTER HAVING A MASS TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. IMAGINE IF THOSE EFFORTS WERE DONE IN SILOS IN THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT NOW. IT TOOK AN INITIATIVE OF THOSE VARIAS IDEA TO BRING TOGETHER NOT ONLY THE RESOURCES BUT THE COORDINATION THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT EVALUATE AND REENGAGE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS WE TRY TO PERFECT A SYSTEM. AND SO. AT THE CORE OF WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE IS PARTNERED WITH REYES SONNENSCHEIN WHO OF COURSE RUNS THE PAT BROWN INSTITUTE AND CAL STATE LA. TO LOOK SQUARELY AT THE ISSUE OF WHO'S IN CHARGE THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN ASKED BY ALMOST EVERYONE OF YOU THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. RAPE IS NOT A HOMELESS EXPERT AND WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE HE'S A GOVERNANCE EXPERT. HE'S ESTABLISHED THE ALLEY CHARTER HE WE HE HAS READ BOOKS ABOUT GOVERNANCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND HE SPEAKS ABOUT IT ON A REGULAR BASIS THERE WILL COULDN'T BE A BETTER PERSON. AND WHAT HE PROPOSES AND I AGREE IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEMS. HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED THAT THERE NOT BE GOVERNMENT. AND THE REASON WHY HE PROPOSES AND NOT BE GOVERNMENT IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CREATING ANOTHER GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY. IT'S ABOUT TAKING AWAY POWER AND AS EVERYONE KNOWS TAKEN AWAY POWER IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS A COORDINATED SYSTEM WHERE TOGETHER WE ARE IDENTIFYING WHAT ARE THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES AND WORK ON THEM ON A ON GOING BASIS. FOR EXAMPLE THE ISSUE OF HOUSING THAT WE HEARD TODAY FROM THE CONTROLLER AND FROM ANSEL WHO RUNS THE HOUSING DEPARTMENT. THE CONTROLLERS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE'S NOTHING THAT HE SAID THAT WAS INACCURATE ABOUT THE COST THE TIME THAT IT TAKES AND THE EFFORT TO BUILD PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. BUT IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY IT'S IT WASN'T LIKE IT WAS A MISTAKE OR THERE'S A GOTCHA IT WAS ACTUALLY DESIGNED AND IT'S WORKING EXACTLY AS IT WAS INTENDED. HOUSE PERMITTED SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS A COMPLICATED LAYER OF THE FUNDING STREAMS EACH WITH THEIR OWN PRIORITIES THEIR OWN THE TIME FRAMES THEIR OWN EXPECTATIONS. AND THE NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS ARE AT THE WHIM OF THOSE FUNDING STREAMS AND I HAVE TO WAIT AND ACCOMMODATE THEM BASED ON AN OBJECTIVE OF BUILDING HOUSING. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ISN'T PUT IN THE FRONT OF THE LINE ON DEVELOPMENT. AND SO THE TIME IT'S TAKING IT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT'S ACCEPTABLE AND I THINK ANGELENOS AND CLEARLY ALL OF YOU ARE SAYING THAT IT'S NOT. SO IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH JUST TO CRITICIZE AND SAY WELL IT'S NOT WORKING THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIX IT. AND THERE ISN'T A PLACE OUTSIDE MAYBE TODAY THERE'S A CONVERSATION BUT THERE ISN'T A PLACE TODAY IT ANYWHERE LOS ANGELES WORK PEOPLE'S JOB IT IS TO FIGURE THAT QUESTION NOW. HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY BUILD AT THE SCALE THAT WE NEED. AT THE TIME FRAME THAT WE NEED AT THE MAGNITUDE THAT WE NEED THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE NEED NO ONE COULD GIVE YOU THE ANSWER TO THAT. WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE ANA OUTREACH LEVEL WHAT KIND OF BED SHOULD THEY BE. ALL OF THAT IS PART OF IT SO. SO FOR US. IT'S BEFORE WE THINK ABOUT YET ONE MORE FUNDING STREAM WHAT MORE PROGRAM OR INTERVENTION. I THINK THE ROLE OF THE STATE. IS TO ASK THE QUESTION WHO'S ACCOUNTABLE ON A COORDINATED BASIS. AND I AGREE WITH THE LAST CONVERSATION THE STATE IS NOT AS AN OBSERVER. THE STATE HAS TO BE IN THAT PROCESS AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY DIG INTO THE REPORT THAT THAT THAT WAS DONE TO YOU. I RECOMMENDED IT'S GOOD READING BECAUSE THERE IS IT IS INSTRUCTIVE IF YOU PUT THAT CHART OUT WARMER TIMES BIRTH. THIS IS WHO INFLUENCES LOS US SO IF YOU COULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT. HOW LOSS TO TAKE THE REPORT AND I'M ACTED ON THAT RIGHT YES SO YOU HAVE ALL THOSE ENTITIES AND ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN ELECTED OFFICE WHO. GIVE DIRECTIONAL ALSO. SO WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISS- LEE ROGERS AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE IN YOUR HEART. OKAY IT'S OKAY I YOU WANT TO GO A DIFFERENT IN A DIFFERENT ORDER THAT'S FINE. I'M COMPLETELY OKAY WITH HOW EVERYONE YOU YEAH. HELLO EVERYONE AND THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MAN. SANTIAGO FOR THE INVITE AND FOR ALLOWING THIS FORUM AND ALL OF YOU TO OPEN A HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT ANYTHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SUCH RICH MATERIAL ON THE PREVIOUS PANELS- WHAT I DO WANT TO DO IS. SUPPORT AND OFFER PERSPECTIVE AS THE ON THE GROUND DEVELOPER AND AS OF THE ON THE GROUND- OPERATOR. AND REALLY JUST BRING HOME THE POINT OF- SUPPORTING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BUT ALSO CALLING ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE ON GOING RESOURCES THAT THAT WE MIGHT NEED- VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD I THINK WE ALL ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO PROBABLY THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE BECAUSE- WE ARE THE- WE ARE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND WE HAVE THE DIRT ON THE BOOTS. SO WE CAN ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH YOU- FROM THE SKID ROW HOUSING TRUST PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DEFINITELY WANT TO SAY IS YOU KNOW. WE DO HAVE ACTUAL PROJECTS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR SO WE SUCCESSFULLY BUILT. THREE PROPERTIES AND ONE CLINIC IN SKID ROW. SO IT'S REAL IT'S TANGIBLE YOU KNOW IT'S TACTICAL YOU CAN SEE IT AND WE HAVE RESIDENTS LIVING THERE AND THERE ARE CLIENTS THAT ARE BEING SERVED BY THE JOSH WAREHOUSE- AT THE CLINIC THAT WAS PART OF OUR SIX FOUR NINE LAW. PROGRAM I DO WANT TO ECHO EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID BEFORE YOU KNOW THAT WERE THE RECIPIENTS OF THE LACK OF THE COORDINATION. SO IF YOU SEE THE BUBBLES THAT MIGUEL SANTANA HAD AND YOU HEAR THE PREVIOUS. PANELS THAT SAID THERE'S SEVEN DIFFERENT OF ENTITIES IN THE STACK THERE'S FOURTEEN DIFFERENT GOVERNING AGENCIES WE ALL SIT AND HAVE TO ANSWER FOR ALL OF THEM. SO THERE'S TEN QUESTIONS TO TEN ENTITIES THERE'S ONE HUNDRED ITEMS THAT WE REPORT TO ONE A MONTH OVER MONTH BASIS. IT'S REALLY OVERWHELMING PARTICULARLY FROM A NONPROFIT PERSPECTIVE AND MANY OF US YOU KNOW- AND THE CROWD HAVE A BACKGROUND THAT KNOWS HOW TO MANAGE THAT. BUT ITS FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ITS OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S HUMANISTIC MANAGEMENT AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON- THE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. I DO WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO THAT WAS THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WAS THE COORDINATION OF THE SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO. THERE'S A UNIT PRODUCTION. THEIR SUBSIDY IN VOUCHER PRODUCTION THERE'S CASE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTION AND THERE'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REQUIREMENTS AND SOMETIMES THAT MATH DOESN'T ADD UP. AND THAT WOULD BE. I THINK VERY MUCH APPRECIATED OU KNOW BY OUR ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS THAT IF THERE IS A CENTRALIZED STRUCTURE OF A CORDON COORDINATED ATTEMPT AND GUIDANCE WE COULD ALL KIND OF RALLY TOGETHER. AND MAKE PROGRESS FASTER SO I DO THINK THAT- WE WANT TO ECHO THAT IN AND SHOW SUPPORT FOR THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO CALL OUT IS THERE THERE IS AN INCREASE IN OPERATING COSTS OVERALL WHETHER IT'S PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR SHELTER OR AFFORDABLE. WHEN YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN LIVING ON THE STREET WHETHER IT'S TWO WEEKS OR TWO YEARS AND THEY HAVE- EXPERIENCE TRAUMA AND VERY YOU KNOW DESTITUTE AND IN HORRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY HAVE TO TRANSITION FROM LIVING ON THE STREETS TO LIVING IN A HOME AND THERE'S SOME CARE THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THAT THEIR SERVICES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR THAT. SO IT WOULD BE GREAT TO FOCUS ON THOSE OPERATING COSTS BECAUSE THOSE OPERATING COSTS IF THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED ON A UNIT BY UNIT PERSON BY PERSON BASIS YOU WON'T SEE THESE BACK AN ASTRONOMICAL COSTS BECAUSE WE IGNORED PROBLEM AS IT WAS ESCALATING- SAFETY OVERALL. DON'T NEED TO POINT TO THAT BUT YOU KNOW THE SAFETY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE LIVING IN ENCAMPMENTS THING THEY NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON RESIDENTS IN THE UNITS THEIR SAFETY NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON THE EMPLOYEES THE LITERAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND THE CASE MANAGERS THE OUTREACH WORKERS THEY ARE WORKING UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES TO WHEN THEY NEED TO BE INCENTIVIZED TO CONTINUE THAT WORK AND THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED AS WELL SO THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A FOCUSED ON ON THAT. ALSO I DO I DON'T KNOW HOW WAS ARTICULATED EARLIER BUT I INTERPRET IT IS YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC SUPPORT OR PERCEPTION OF SUPPORT OFTENTIMES AS A DEVELOPER AND THE OWNER AND THE OPERATOR MANY YOU KNOW VOTERS AND INDIVIDUALS AND RIGHTFULLY SO THEY COME TO US IN THERE SAY WHY ARE YOU DEVELOPING FASTER WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT FRONT LINE QUESTIONING. YOU KNOW IT'S VERY UNFORGIVING AT TIMES YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO SO THEY COME TO ALL OF US AND THE PRESSURE NOT THAT WE SHY AWAY FROM IT BUT IT IS ENORMOUS AND WE WOULD LIKE SUPPORT A LITTLE BIT ON THAT BECAUSE AS WE ALL HEARD TODAY IT'S VERY VERY COMPLICATED. AND SIMPLIFYING IT AND COMMUNICATING WHICH I ACTUALLY THINK LOS ANGELES IS A FABULOUS JOB IN IS THE ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE IN THE ATTEMPT TO EDUCATE- I DO WANT TO GET DEFINITELY HIGHLIGHT MIGUEL SANTIAGO AND MIGUEL SANTANA BECAUSE NOT DID YOU JUST PUT YOUR KIND OF YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH WAS FOR US YOU PUT YOUR FEET ON OUR FLOORS TWO YOU KNOW AND THAT AND THAT'S A LOT YOU KNOW THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO DO THAT SO APPRECIATE THAT- IN MY- SCREEN WENT BLANK SO SORRY NOW I JUST HAVE TO- AND- I THINK JUST. HOW CAN WE ALL FACILITATE THE SLIDE INTO HOMELESSNESS THERE'S NO EASY ANSWER BUT- I WILL I THINK THAT ALL OF US WOULD SAY WE WOULD LOVE TO PARTICIPATE IN A STATE COUNTY CITY LOCAL. YOU KNOW- COMMITTEE STRUCTURE WHATEVER IT IS TO SAY WHAT WHAT IS SLIDING INTO HOMELESSNESS AND HOW CAN WE STOP THAT AS A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPER. THE MATH DOESN'T WORK WE CAN'T DEVELOP FAST ENOUGH OUT OF THIS WE WANT TO KEEP DEVELOPING THOSE UNITS AS A LONG TERM SOLUTION. BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON MAKING SURE THAT SLIDE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT MENTAL WELLNESS IS ABSOLUTELY PRIORITIZE AND FOCUS ON SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THERE'S A FULL SPECTRUM SOLUTION. THOUGHT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE POLICY PROPOSALS THAT HELP TO FACILITATE MOVE THAT QUICKER- THANK YOU. MISTER FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. AT THE DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER WE REALLY APPRECIATED AND- WE'RE HONORED TO BE HERE THANK YOU THIS IS ALSO FACILITY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TEAR SANTIAGO AN HONORABLE MEMBERS I HAD MY NAME'S AMY TURK THE CEO OF DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER AND WE'RE JUST SO HONORED TO BE HOSTING THIS HEARING TODAY WE'RE HERE WITH. OUR FABULOUS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OUR STAFF SEVENTY ONE RESIDENTS AND THE WOMEN WHO COME TO OUR ACCESS CENTER- POSTING YOU HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR COMING. I LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER THE EXPERIENCES OF HOMELESSNESS AMONG WOMEN. AND AS YOU ASKED WHAT DOES NOT WORK IN TERMS OF ENDING HOMELESSNESS ESPECIALLY FOR THIS POPULATION. IN OFFERING TO SOLUTIONS RELATED TO PROGRAMS AND LEGISLATION THAT OUR SCALE SCALEABLE WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AT DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED TO ENDING HOMELESSNESS FOR WOMEN IN LOS ANGELES WE'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SKID ROW COMMUNITY FOR OVER FORTY THREE YEARS. AND EVERY YEAR WE SERVE AROUND FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WOMEN WITH THE FULL CONTINUUM OF SERVICES. WE WERE THE NATION'S FIRST PROVIDER OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WE'VE LONG ADVOCATED THAT PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS COUPLED WITH NECESSARY SUPPORT. IN THE CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS AND WE BACK THAT UP WITH THE SECTOR LEADING 98% HOUSING RETENTION RATE. WE OWN AND OPERATE TWO BUILDINGS ONE THAT YOU'RE AT TODAY. AT THE HOUSE A HUNDRED IN NINETEEN WOMEN WE ALSO SUPPORT SEVEN HUNDRED WOMEN AND FAMILIES THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY THROUGH PROGRAMS THAT WORK. LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES HOUSING FOR HEALTH PROGRAM. RAPID RE HOUSING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOUSING FIRST PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT OF KOBE DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER SERVED TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE WOMEN IN A PROJECT ROOM KEY. ONE OF WHATEVER AREAS FOR GROWTH IS IN THE CREATION OF NEW PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WE WILL BE THE SERVICE PROVIDER IN SIX NEW BUILDINGS FROM VAN NUYS TO MONTEBELLO. TO HOUSE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT TO MYSTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS A NEW PERMANENT HOUSING ONE OF THOSE BUILDINGS WILL BE HERE ON THE PARKING LOT THE HOPEFULLY YOU GOT A PARKING SPOT. ON TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO INVITING YOU TO MANY GROUND BREAKING THING MANY GRAND OPENING. UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH OVER THE LAST DECADE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN LA HAS NEARLY DOUBLED OUTPACING THE RATE OF MEN. WOMEN NOW MAKE UP 38% OF ON HOUSING ANGELENOS. FOR FAR TOO LONG AND IN PARTICULAR UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN WHO ARE EX EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITHOUT DEPENDENCE AND YOU ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR FAMILY DESIGN PROGRAMS. HAVE BEEN LARGELY INVISIBLE TO POLICYMAKERS. UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN WHO MAKE UP NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF LOS ANGELES ON HOUSE FEMALE POPULATION FOR DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK. WAIT ON AVERAGE TEN PLUS YEARS TAXES STABLE HOUSING AT A RATE DOUBLE THAT AMEND. IT IS NOT MORE PROFOUND TODAY WITH THE RAIN. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE IS THE MAIN DRIVER INTO HOMELESSNESS FOR WOMEN HOUSING ARE UNSHELTERED NEIGHBORS IS A CRITICAL GENDER EQUITY ISSUE. YOU'VE ASKED US TO SPEAK ON WHAT DOES NOT HELP WHAT DOES NOT HELP IS CRIMINALIZING POVERTY AND QUOTE SURVIVORS OF SERVICE- CRIMES OF SURVIVAL SUCH AS SEX WORK OR EVEN JUST SLEEPING OUTDOORS. PROVIDING AN ADEQUATE ACCESS TO EVERYTHING FROM BASIC HYGIENE TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOT OFFERING PATHWAYS TO PERMANENT HOUSING AND CONTINUING TO UNDER INVEST PARTICULARLY IN SERVICES FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS. I BELIEVE HERE THAT WHAT WE DO A DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER OFFERS A CLEAR AND REPLICABLE MODEL OF WHAT DOES WORK. ONE MAJOR RECENT EXAMPLE THIS PAST SUMMER DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER DEVELOP TO THE EVERYWOMAN HOUSE ACTION PLAN. THIS IS TO END HOMELESSNESS TO THE SIX HUNDRED UNSHELTERED WOMEN WHO RESIDE IN THE SKID ROW COMMUNITY. AND THANKS TO OUR LEADERSHIP OF SUPERVISORS POLICE IN MITCHELL IN COLLABORATION WITH COUNTY DEPARTMENTS LHASA IN PARTNERS LIKE SKID ROW HOUSING TRUST. WE ARE BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN. KEY INGREDIENTS ARE THE USE OF HOTELS FOR INTERIM HOUSING AND A NEW COUNTY PROGRAM RUN BY LHASA AND PATH. CALLED THE RESIDENT AND PROPERTY SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS HEALTH MASTER LEASE BUILDINGS WHERE WE CAN QUICKLY MOVE IN LARGE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE. ADDITIONALLY WHILE THE DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER AUTHORED STATE BILL SIX SEVEN EIGHT UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS HELD IN A ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS. I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER HAS CO AUTHORED LEGISLATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHICH WE HOPE TO INTRODUCE IN JANUARY TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR DOMESTIC DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS. AND WOMEN. AS YOU KNOW WITH THE SUSTAINED COMMITMENT TO ATTACKING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS PARTICULARLY RACIAL AND GENDER INEQUITIES. ENHANCING REGIONAL COLLABORATION INVESTING IN BEST PRACTICES INTER MAGICALLY EXPANDING THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING WE CAN'T ENVISION A LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH EVERYONE IN HOUSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR BOARD CHAIR HERE TO YOU WANTED TO DO SIR YES WE HAVE LISTED FOR- HERE TO SHARE WITH VICKI CURRY AND WE HAVE JUST CAMANCHE CREA. HERE'S WHAT OKAY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THE AMAZING WORK THAT YOU DO. ALL YOUR SIR OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEN AND COULD BE HERE MONIES CAN CRAFT. I'M THE FOUNDER AND CEO AT HOPE OF THE VALLEY RESCUE MISSION. IS A Q. WEEKS AGO ACTUALLY COUPLE MONTHS AGO NOW THAT JEFFREY KATZENBERG FROM DREAMWORKS CAME AND WANTED TO OUR ONE OF OUR TINY HOME FACILITIES. AT THE END OF IT HE SAID. BUT YOU WANNA KNOW WHY I'M HERE I SAID YEAH I REALLY DO. HE SAID. BECAUSE I THINK THE VOTERS ARE FED UP. HE SAID WE'VE PASSED THESE BOND MEASURES AND YET WE STILL SEE SO MANY CANNONS INCREASE OF PEOPLE ON THE STREETS HE SAYS I'M AFRAID FOR YOU. I SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN. IS I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE MONEY. AND THE VOTERS ARE GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU. AND HE SAID WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS WHILE WE CONTINUE TO BUILD PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN. WE KNOW THAT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS WHERE WE'RE GOING WHERE IT HAS TO END WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE THERE BUT IN THE MEANTIME IN THE MEANTIME THE STREETS CANNOT BE THE WAITING ROOM FOR PERMANENT HOUSING AS IS VINCE ALREADY SAID MUCH MORE ELOQUENT THAN I COULD SAY IT'S YES AND- WE NEED BOTH. AND THE ABILITY TO BRING PEOPLE INSIDE QUICKLY. I OFTEN THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN GOD FORBID IF THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE TONIGHT MORNING IN ALL THESE BUILDINGS WERE RED TAGGED IN AND WE HAD SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WERE HOMELESS IN OUR GREAT CITY. THE NATIONAL GUARD WOULD BE HERE IN MINUTES THE RED CROSS TO BE MOBILIZED WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS DID NOT HAVE TO LIVE UNSHELTERED. ONE NIGHT. AND YET HOW MANY YEARS HAVE WE SAID WHILE THIS IS A REAL CRISIS WE'RE FACING. HOMELESSNESS WHILE IT'S TERRIBLE AND YET WE HAVE NOT HAD A FEMA LIKE RESPONSE. IN TWENTY TWENTY WE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF OPENING TO LARGE CONGREGANT SHELTERS ONE IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD AND ONE IN VAN NUYS ONE EIGHTY FIVE BEDS ONE HUNDRED BEDS. THE NEXT YEAR WE HAD THE PRIVILEGE IN THIS IS ALL WORKING WITH LASSA WORKING WITH LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBERS IN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATE. MEMBERS AND WE WERE ABLE TO OPEN UP. SIX TINY HOME COMMUNITIES. THE VERY FIRST TINY HOME COMMUNITY LOS ANGELES WAS ON CHANDLER BOULEVARD IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD. IN THE LAST ONE WHICH IS OPENED HERE IN COUNCIL DISTRICT FOURTEEN COUNCILMAN KIM DAILY ON AND I KNOW WE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF A NUMBER OF US ACTUALLY SPENDING THE NIGHT IN THOSE TINY HOMES WHAT IS IT LIKE. AND IT THE INITIAL COSTS WERE QUITE HIGH BECAUSE THE FIRST PROJECT WAS ACTUALLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF RAW DIRT WHERE THERE IS NO SEWER LINES NO WATER LINES NO GAS LINES AND THEY POURED CONCRETE PADS AND IT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE BUT I'M PROUD TO SAY THE LAST ONE THAT WAS JUST OPEN AND COUNCILS TO FOURTEEN THE AVERAGE COST PER UNIT WAS AROUND FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THOSE TINY HOME UNITS AND I'M I'M NOT HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR PALLET SHELTER OR ANY OTHER TIME YOU I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. WHAT I DO CARE ABOUT IS WE GET PEOPLE INDOORS BECAUSE THE LONGER PEOPLE STAY OUTSIDE THE MORE THEY DETERIORATE MENTALLY PHYSICALLY EMOTIONALLY AND SO WE'VE GOT TO BRING PEOPLE INSIDE. I MEAN TELLING PEOPLE TO STAY ON THE STREETS TO WE CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS ME HAVING HYPOTHERMIA AND SAYING CAN WAIT IN THE SNOW INTO THE DOCTOR CAN SEE YOU. WE WOULDN'T DO THAT. AND SO WE HAVE TO BE HUMANE WE HAVE TO ACT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY. AND SO. ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE REALIZED AND AS A SERVICE PROVIDER WE'RE VERY LIMITED IN WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T DO. BUT GOVERNMENT YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF LEVERS YOU CAN PULL. I MEAN THERE'S WAYS TO INCREASE REVENUE THERE'S WAYS TO CUT EXPENSES THERE'S WAYS TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AND SO I GOTTA TELL YA. I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC WHY LAST. TINY HOME COMMUNITY AT LEAST IN COUNCIL PARKER KOREANS DISTRICT I WAS THERE WHEN HE- AND THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES ERIC GARCETTI. WHEN PAUL KRIKORIAN PROBABLY PROCLAIM HE SAID I NOW HAVE BEDS FOR EVERY BODY THAT IS ST HOMELESS IN MY COUNCIL DISTRICT. WOW HOW MANY COUNCIL MEMBERS COULD SAY THAT AT LEAST OR WANT TO SAY THAT BUT I ALSO KNOW HE WAS A VERY AGGRESSIVE IN MAKING SURE FINDING WHAT LANDS AVAILABLE WHAT CAN WHAT CAN YOU DO. AND I WE ALL NEED TO HAVE THAT SENSE OF URGENCY AND I KNOW THERE'S CAL AYE WE WORK WITH COUNT ALL THE COUNCIL MEMBERS YOU KNOW IN IN THE IN THAT AREA AND I'M SO THANKFUL FOR EACH ONE AND THAT. SOMETIMES IT'S DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN. BUT WE CAN'T GIVE UP AND ON THE STATE LEVEL AND IS SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE ON A CITY LEVEL AND COUNTY LEVEL ON A FEDERAL LEVEL AND- YOU KNOW WHO'S THIS JUSTICE JUST FOR PERSPECTIVE. IN TWENTY TWENTY HOPE OF THE VALLEY WE FINISHED WITH SEVEN SHELTERS FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN BEDS ONCE WE GET THE TREBEK'S CENTER OPEN WHICH WOULD BE A NUMBER OF MONTHS WE WILL HAVE SIXTEEN HOMELESS SHELTERS ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO BEDS. THAT NEVER COULD HAPPEN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE SUPPORT OF OUR CITY OUR COUNTY AND OUR STATE AND OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER AND SO I'M ENCOURAGED LET'S KEEP WORKING TOGETHER. AND WITH LET'S A LET'S MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU MISTER KRAFT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR AND- YOU BEING HERE AND- GRATEFUL THAT YOU GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY. THIS SLEEPER TITLE. THANKS FOR THE MEASURE EXPERIENCE AND- I THOUGHT SOMEBODY HASN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO DO IT I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO- BECAUSE IT IS AN ALTERNATIVE- THAT ALSO WORKS A VERY COST EFFECTIVE RATE. AND NINETY DAYS TO SET UP IS WHAT YOU TOLD ME- AND- LEFT TO BREAK SOMETHING DIFFERENT. NINETY DAYS FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT BEGINNING TO END. IT TAKES ONE HOUR TO ASSEMBLE THE TINY HOMES THAT'S HOW QUICK THEY GO UP. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN WE CAN BE COMMISSION THOSE TINY HOME SITES OF THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE IN THE WORLD- THAT NEEDS THEM. AND WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN LOS ANGELES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'M ALLOW ANY QUICK QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF. THE YES. THE FORMER CITY YES I. I WANT TO THANK OF- MISTER KRAFT FOR YOUR YOUR CALM SOME AND COMPLETELY IN LINE WITH YOU THAT THAT WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE DYING AND WE NEED TO HAVE THAT SENSE OF URGENCY I WANT TO SAY THOUGH THAT. WHEN I. TRY TO IT. TO ADDRESS THAT- SENSE OF URGENCY. WITH WITH THE BILL THAT I INTRODUCED- IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY TO TRY TO PRIORITIZE. STATE SPENDING. A TO FIRST BUILD SHELTERS I COULDN'T EVEN GET A HEARING FOR THE BILL BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THE- HI MIKE MY BROTHER- AND SEE MEN ON THE FLOOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAVID CHIU WHO CHAIRS THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW. HE IS A FORMER CHAIR- WAY WAS INDICATING THAT- YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO WE DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THE NEW YORK CITY MODEL THAT WE DON'T WANT ALL THE MONEY TO BE SUCKED UP INTO THE INTO THE SHELTERS AND I. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT- YOU KNOW IT SHOULDN'T BE EITHER OR BUT BOTH BUT- I JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF. OF YOU KNOW THE DEBATE- HAPPENING AGAIN IN THE STATE CAPITAL I WANTED TO WHAT TOURNAMENT SESSEGNON. AMEEN YOUR YOUR YOUR OF- HIGHLIGHTING YOU KNOW THE BIG THIS THEME THAT WE'RE HEARING IN TERMS OF THE LACK OF COORDINATION AND IN IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENT SILOS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. AND YET YOU KNOW LIKE- FOR ME I REPRESENT MOSTLY SUBURBAN CITIES WHERE WE HAVE LIKE A STRONG CITY MANAGER MODEL WHERE YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE THERE IS THERE THERE. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE CITIES HAVE A CITY WIDE COORDINATED EFFORT AND SO I'M I'M YOU KNOW OF THE A BABE IN THE WOODS IN TERMS OF THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE OF REALITIES OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- I MEAN BUT HEARING FROM YOU AND FROM COUNCILWOMAN. A RAMAN OF ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THERE IS NO COORDINATED STRATEGY WHAT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES YOU KNOW WITH ESPECIALLY IF- YOU AS THE FORMER C. A. O. OF BOTH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. YOU KNOW I MEAN I KNOW YOU WERE YOU'RE POINTING TO US IT TO THE STATE SAYING YOU NEED TO DO IT TO YOU KNOW- THE TO COORDINATE STATE EFFORTS AND I'M LIKE WONDERING. YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE BE GIVING MORE MONEY TO THE CITY AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WHEN YOU CAN COORDINATE YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE PROGRAMS HERE SO- CAN I ASK FOR YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT. I THINK THE- MUCH. MY FIRST COMES FROM BEING IN BOTH PLACES AND KNOWING THAT DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF BOTH THE CITY AND THE COUNTY YOU'RE HEARD THAT TODAY THAT THERE IS NO PLACE WHERE THE CITY AND THE COUNTY LET ALONE THE OTHER EIGHTY SEVEN CITIES ARE TRYING TO SORT OUT NOT ONLY BE IMMEDIATE ISSUES LIKE THE ONE YOU REYES OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND- IMMEDIATE SHELTER. BUT REALLY PLAN OUT FOR THE FUTURE AS TO WHERE WE'RE GOING AND SO I'LL GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF L. A. METRO RIGHT. LA METRO IS A REGIONAL- GOVERNING SYSTEM THAT OVERSEES NOT TEST THE EXISTING BRICKS AND MORTAR OF A SYSTEM THAT IS RAIL. AND A BUS SYSTEM BUT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. AND WHILE IN PERFECT AND CERTAINLY HAS ITS SHARE OF CHALLENGES. A COUPLE TIMES A MONTH EACH MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE MAYOR AND HIS DESIGNATE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REGION OF THE COUNTY SHOW UP AT A MEETING LIKE THIS AND HAVE TO SORT OUT THE COMPLICATED ISSUES OF WRITING IN THE SYSTEM HAVE CONVINCED NOT ONLY ANGELENOS COUNTY WIDE TO TAX THEMSELVES FOR A FUTURE SYSTEM. BUT HAVE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE AND EFFECTIVE IN CONVINCING YOU THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT A REGIONAL SYSTEM BASED ON A LONG TERM VISION. AS WELL AS TRYING TO SORT OUT THE REAL CHALLENGES OF. HOW DO YOU INCREASE RIDERSHIP HOW DO YOU HAVE DIFFERENT BILL LADD MODALITIES OF SYSTEM SO THE MERE FACT THAT THERE IS A PLACE. THAT FRANKLY WAS CREATED BY THE STATE IT WASN'T IT DIDN'T IT WASN'T IT DIDN'T COME FROM US. THAT THE ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION IS LOOKED OUT REGIONALLY WHEN YOU SHOW UP TO THAT MEETING YOU'RE NOT JUST REPRESENTING THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IF YOU'RE THE MAYOR YOU'RE REPRESENTING THE REGION. GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE ON A ON GOING BASIS. AND SO THE WHAT WE SUGGEST IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A PLACE LIKE THAT. WHETHER IT'S A FORMAL J. P. A. IN A FORTY THAT HAS BINDING AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO TAX ALL OF US. THAT BUILDS AS WELL AS MANAGES OR IT'S SIMPLY A PLACE OF CORD NATION. LHASA IT IS SUBJECT IS THE IS THE VICTIM OF THE LACK OF COORDINATION IT'S NOT BECAUSE EVERYONE ASSUMES THERE THE IN CHARGE BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO TELL YOU THEY'RE NOT. AND SO. THAT'S WHAT IF THAT'S WHERE WE'RE REALLY COMING AT THIS PROBLEM IS UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL OF THESE EFFORTS ARE HAPPENING. AND THERE'S COORDINATION THAT HAPPENS ON A VERY EPISODIC BASIS EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH A LOT OF CARING PEOPLE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING VERY HARD. BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING ON A SYSTEMIC BASIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M GONNA. HI IF I COULD JUST ASK A MISTER SANTANA- FOLLOW UP QUESTION- I READ THAT REPORT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WITH- WITH GREAT INTEREST AND YOU KNOW SOME- FANTASTIC IDEAS- BUT- WHAT POWER IS ACTUALLY INTENDED TO BE CONFERRED UPON THIS BODY- YOU STARTED YOUR REMARKS I RECALL BY SAYING TAKING POWER IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND- PROBABLY- A NONSTARTER SELF HOW DO WE CONFIRM POWER. OF COORDINATION OF DECISION MAKING- METRO IS A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT METRO HAS A LOT OF POWER- TO COORDINATE AND TO SPEND MONEY. SO WE I STARTED OFF WHEN WE DID THIS WORK WITH A VERY BY A CLEAR BIAS THAT UNLESS IT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO. CONTROL LAND BUILD MANAGE TAX BOND THEN IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME. BUT THIS IS WHERE HIGHER HIRING AN OUTSIDE EXPERT ON GOVERNANCE ACTUALLY IS HELPFUL AND RAY FIFTY KNOW HIM IS VERY INDEPENDENT THINKING HE UNDERSTANDS L. A. FROM A GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE BETTER THAN ANYONE. AND HE BASICALLY ARGUED THAT IF YOU START THERE BY TAKING AWAY POWER FROM EVERYONE ELSE THAT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THERE HAS TO BE A SEPARATE ENTITY WHOSE JOB IT IS TO ANSWER THESE BIG QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT IS OUR TEN YEAR PROJECTION. WHAT ROLES TO EACH JURISDICTION HAVE WHAT WHAT IS THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED EARLIER WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM HOMELESSNESS ARE ALSO SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION AND THE MENTAL ILLNESS THERE ISN'T AN ANSWER FOR YOU TODAY. WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE. AND REALLY BUILDING A CONSENSUS AROUND THOSE ISSUES AND HAVING EACH ENTITY DO THEIR PART. NOW ULTIMATELY I STILL THINK YOU NEED AN AUTHORITY THAT HAS THE POWER TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT. BUT IF WE START OFF WITH THAT PREMISE THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS WORK PEOPLE HAVE TO GIVE UP POWER. IT'S GONNA DIE THERE UNLESS IT'S OPPOSED BY ALL OF YOU FRANKLY IT WOULD REQUIRE AN EXTERNAL INTERVENTION EITHER BY THE VOTERS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. OR THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MANDATE THAT IN A- IN A IN A CLEAR WAY. BUT IF IT'S DONE IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN INTERNALLY. THANK YOU- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION OF BIG ROB AUTHORITIES HANGING OUT HERE IN THE COLD- IT ONLY EMPHASIZES. THE SENSE OF URGENCY FOR THOSE WHO ARE LIVING IN TENTS ON THE STREETS OF THE LA REGION. AMBASSADOR EXPELLER COME UP MISS LAW FROM CENTER CITY FOR THE FUSION. DHIMMIS IN THE MIDST BUSINESS COUNCIL- AND MISS- COLQUITT FROM- DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER PLEASE. YEAH WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND OFF ON JULY FOURTH WE- YEAH. THANKS FOR. UHHUH THE BILL WOULD BE A THE- LATER ON THE JEFF. AFTER MISS LAW- WOULD YOU CAN KICK A SAUCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY OKAY THANK YOU SOME. IT'S WONDER TO BE- IN JOINT SESSION IS PANEL A GROUP OF. I'M FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME MY NAME IS JESSICA LAL I SERVE AS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CENTRAL CITY ASSOCIATION PROBABLY REPRESENT OVER THREE HUNDRED MEMBERS ACROSS LA AS SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES MANY OF WHOM ARE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS ARCHITECTS DO A LOT OF WORK IN HOMELESSNESS AS WELL AS- SERVICE PROVIDERS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS- OUR POLICY AGENDA FOCUSES ON MAKING DOWNTOWN. THE PLACE FOR HOUSING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS AND ADVANCING COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS SKID ROW WE KNOW IS AT THE CENTER OF THE CRISIS AND WE BELIEVE THAT SKID ROW SHOULD BE USED AS THE BAROMETER FOR MEASURING OUR PROGRESS- WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN SETTING REALISTIC GOALS IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR HOUSING NEEDS ARE. BUT THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE HOUSING UNITS ARE ABLE TO BE KILLED AND I WAS WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN ORDER TO DO SO WE BELIEVE WE NEED STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY AND COORDINATION AND THE CONTINUED SENSE OF URGENCY. WE KNOW THAT HISTORIC UNDER PRODUCTION OF HOUSING CONTRIBUTES TO HOMELESSNESS LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN HAS UNDER PRODUCE NEW HOUSING AND HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH DEMAND. DOWNTOWN IS ACTUALLY PRODUCE THE MOST NEW HOUSING UNITS OF ANYWHERE IN THE NATION THIS YEAR AND ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR ONE THIRD OF ALL NEW APARTMENTS BUILT IN THE CITY OVER THE LAST DECADE BUT THE CITY AS WE KNOW IT AS A WHOLE IS NOT BUILDING ENOUGH UNITS. THE CITY HAS ACTUALLY ONLY BUILT ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE HOUSING THAT WE DID DURING ITS PEAK PRODUCTION YEARS WHICH WAS SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED UNITS PER YEAR NOW COMPARED TO THE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND UNITS BUILT BETWEEN NINETEEN SIXTY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING ACROSS THE CITY TO MEET PASSED EXISTING AND FUTURE DEMANDS AND WE MUST MAKE IT MORE COST AND TIME EFFECTIVE TO DO SO OUR MEMBERS ADVOCATED FOR THE CITY TO HAVE A HOUSING PRODUCTION REQUIREMENT. I'VE NEARLY HALF A MILLION UNTS WHICH NEEDS TO BE MET BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE. AND ABOUT HALF OF THOSE UNITS NEED TO BE AFFORDABLE. THE CITY'S RECENTLY ADOPTED HOUSING ELEMENT ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO BUILD THIS HOUSING EQUITABLY. NEAR RESOURCE AND TRANSIT RICH AREAS. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THE CITY WILL NEED TO UPDATE ZONING TO ACCOMMODATE THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING NEEDS TO BE BUILT. WE ALSO MUST CONTINUE TO BE MORE WELCOMING ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF INNOVATIVE HOUSING TYPOLOGIES LIKE MICRO UNITS ADOPTED YOU RE USE AND MASS TIMBER WHICH IS A PRE FABRICATED ALTERNATIVE THAT CAN BE BUILT TAUGHT TO. TALL WOOD BUILDINGS. WE'VE SEEN WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WHEN GOVERNMENT IMPROVES APPROVAL PROCESS I WANT TO RECOGNIZE CHAIR SANTIAGO FOR AB ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN WHICH STREAMLINED APPROVAL PROCESS FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTING AN INTERIM HOUSING. SAVING TIME AND REDUCING UNDUE INFLUENCE WE ALSO SAW AN INTERIM NON CONGREGATE SHELTER STOOD UP IN RECORD TIME WITH THE SOLEUS CARE FIRST VILLAGE THAT USE MODULAR CONSTRUCTION AND STRONG CITY AND COUNTY DEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION. IN ORDER TO MEET THE MOMENT WE MUST CONTINUE TO HAVE ACTION COORDINATION STRATEGICALLY AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THE STATE OBVIOUSLY HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY. AND I WANT TO OFFER UP THAT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND PRIVATE SECTOR WANT TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. LEVERAGE THEIR EXPERTISE THEIR RESOURCES TO BE A PART OF AS A CONSIDERED PARTNER I'M WITH THAT I YIELD MY TIME I KNOW WERE WERE LATE BUT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR- FOR HAVING ME AND GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU MISS ALL I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY AND I THINK YOU GUYS ALSO PRODUCED A REPORT THAT WE WILL ALSO LOOK THROUGH. THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT YES THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU TO WANT TO GO I'M OKAY WITH WHATEVER ORDER YOU CHOOSE. GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR AND UNDER GET A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS HERIS ROSENBLOOM I AM THE ROSALINDE AND ARTHUR GILBERT- FOUNDATION FELLOW FOR THE LOS ANGELES BUSINESS COUNCIL INSTITUTE- WHERE I FOCUS ON GUIDING THE INSTITUTE'S HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS POLICY INITIATIVES. OF THE L. A. B. C. INSTITUTE IS THE RESEARCH ARM OF THE LOS ANGELES BUSINESS COUNCIL IT WAS CREATED IN TWENTY TEN AND HAS DONE RESEARCH EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IT SUPPORTS THE WORK OF THE L. A. B. C. WHICH REPRESENTS OVER FIVE HUNDRED BUSINESS GOVERNMENT PHILANTHROPIC AND ACADEMIC MEMBERS. JUST LAST WEEK- THE L. A. B. C. INSTITUTE RELEASED A HOMELESSNESS SURVEY THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON- AT THE HOMES THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY HART RESEARCH ASSOCIATES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE L. A. TIMES- AND UC BERKELEY'S INSTITUTE OF GOVERNMENTAL STUDIES- THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO OUR TWENTY NINETEEN SURVEY. THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE OVERWHELMING ATTITUDE OF VOTERS THAT HOMELESSNESS IS FAR AND AWAY THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN LA. THIS NEW STUDY AIMED TO HIGHLIGHT THE CHANGES IN PUBLIC PERCEPTION ON HOMELESSNESS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS- AND- ALSO WHICH WHICH KINDS OF SOLUTIONS OF VOTER SUPPORT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE POLL AND SOLUTIONS THAT PULLED BEST TO GIVE YOU ALL A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE- YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE ON THE ISSUE. OVERALL HOMELESSNESS REMAINS JUST AS URGENT IN THE MINDS OF L. A. COUNTY VOTERS IS BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY BUT- 94% HAVE CALLED IT A SERIOUS OR VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. A 79% OF RESPONDENTS SAY THE ISSUE HAS WORSENED IN THE COUNTY AT LARGE- INTO THIRD SAY IT HAS WORSENED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THIS NUMBER STOOD OUT A 39% REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE CONSIDERED MOVING AWAY- FROM. LA BECAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS WITH SPECIFICALLY. IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED SIGNIFICANT ATTITUDINAL CHANGES AMONG VOTERS THERE'S THE SHIFT. FROM COMPASSION TO FRUSTRATION AND EXASPERATION AND IT'S- LARGELY DIRECTED AT GOVERNMENT AND WHAT VTERS VIEW AS ON A VACUUM OF LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE. AND STILL NOT NEARLY TWO IN THREE VOTERS FEEL THAT HOMELESSNESS IS CAUSED LARGELY BY SOCIETAL FACTORS- AND THE VAST MAJORITY ABOUT 76% BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD GUARANTEE ACCESS TO SHELTER AS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT- A CLEAR MAJORITY OF VOTERS. FEEL THAT THIS IS THE TIME FOR ACTION WHICH HAS BEEN SAID AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE DAY- TWO TO ONE MARGIN- THEY WANT SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS OVER LONG TERM. OF THAT OBVIOUSLY THE VOTERS FEEL THAT BOTH ARE NECESSARY BUT- THEY- THERE IS AN URGENCY IN THE AND THEIR FEELINGS RIGHT NOW AND THEY THEY WANT SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM NOW- WE PROVIDED SIX. SPECIFIC POLICIES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE USED IN RECENT YEARS TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. AND ALL ALL OF THE PTIONS RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM A MAJORITY OF VOTERS WITH A COUPLE STRONGLY SUPPORTED- BY ALL BY MORE THAN HALF. OF VOTERS THE TWO POLICIES THAT. VOTERS SUPPORTED MOST WERE HOUSING HOMELESS PEOPLE IN EXISTING BUILDINGS SO ADAPTIVE REUSE POLICY IS 81% SUPPORTED THAT- AND THE BUILDING COMMUNITIES OF TINY HOMES IT HAS ALSO BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY 80% SUPPORTED TINY HOME CONSTRUCTION SITES FOR VEHICLES AND RVS TO SERVICE CAMPSITES. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS SUPPORTED THE ACQUISITION AND CONVERSION OF HOTELS AS WELL AS THE TEMPORARILY RENTING HOTELS AND MOTELS. TO HOUSE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO VOTER IS YOU KNOW HAVE CLEARLY SHOWN. THAT THEY SUPPORT THESE INNOVATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS- THAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY CREATED AND SUPPORT THEIR EXPANSION BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS ATTITUDINAL IT'S A- SURVEY THAT- ACCOUNTS FOR A POINT IN TIME OF HOW VOTERS ARE FEELING- SO THE IMPORTANT LESSON. IN THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE SPECIFIC POLICIES THAT WE MENTIONED BUT THAT THERE'S A STRONG SUPPORT FOR FAST ACTIONABLE SOLUTIONS AND THEN LASTLY. OF VOTERS ARE LESS WILLING TO TAX THEMSELVES DESPITE THIS- A BARE MAJORITY INCREASE TO CREATE INITIATIVES TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. HOWEVER THAT SUPPORT INTENSIFIES- WITH THE PROMISE OF A PLAN THAT ENSURES ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. I'M SO BUT ALSO VOTERS ARE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT USING SOME FUNDING TO WORK WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR- ON SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS THAT ARE INNOVATIVE LOW COST AND CAN BE QUICKLY DEVELOPED. AT THE L. A. B. C. HAS SUPPORTED LOCAL ENTITIES- DRIVING THIS TYPE OF INNOVATION WHICH HAS WORKED WITH THE CITY OF LA TO. DEVELOP A FIRST OF ITS KIND TINY HOME FACILITY- TRAMMELL CROW COMPANY WHICH HAS BEEN A LEADER AND- AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AS PART OF THE CITY'S TOC. PROGRAM GREAT MODULAR WHICH CONVERTS SHIPPING CONTAINERS INTO HOUSING UNITS AND SCS CAPITAL- GROUP WITH HIS SUPPORT OF HOUSING FUND DELIVERS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. USING PRIVATE EQUITY- THE HOUSING ARE HUNG OUT ON HOUSE NEIGHBORS IS THE TOP PRIORITY CLEARLY FOR ANGELENOS AND AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE L. A. BIT BUSINESS COMMUNITY- WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME- AND THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE ON THIS- HEARING. AND HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE A RESOURCE FOR YOU ALL AND YOUR OFFICES- IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO. TO FIGHT TO END HOMELESSNESS THANK YOU THE ADDRESS MY- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE I TOOK I DID TAKE A LOOK AT THE WHOLE AND THEN IN THE SUMMER SO IF YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT A PORT PRETTY INSTRUCTIVE- CERTAINLY STILL THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE. BUT THE URGENCY IS SO MUCH GREATER AND DEMANDING IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS. TO THE PROBLEM WE DEFEAT AND THAT OF. THE POINTED TO THINGS. WHICH WHICH ARE IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF YOU DO WITH THE HONOR- SUSAN- YOU SPOKEN TO US IN THE PAST AND WERE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK AGAIN- THANK YOU M. I HOPE IT'S OKAY IF I CONTINUE TO WEAR MY MASK I'D- FEEL EVENTER LINE HEALTH CONDITIONS I JUST FEEL SAFER TO ME HOWEVER YOU PREFER TO DO IT IS HOW WE'RE DOING. OKAY THINK. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY GOOD AFTERNOON TO. CHAIR AND THE AT. OTHERS FAMILY MEMBERS- AND I WANTED TO JUST SHARES- JUST SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT- WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES AT THIS POINT- I MYSELF- LIKE MANY WOMEN- ENTERED HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND OF. YOU KNOW AFTER THREE YEARS OF WHICH I OF COURSE WAS FROM IT WAS DEEPLY TRAUMATIZED SAY WAS NOT AWARE OF IT SO MUCH I WAS JUST BUSY TRYING TO SURVIVE. AND I FOUND MYSELF- NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I GREW UP ON THE WEST SIDE I. WORKED ALL MY LIFE THEY HAD YOU KNOW A GOOD CAREER IN IT AND I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD FIND MYSELF EITHER A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION OR HOMELESSNESS. AND IT'S- YOU KNOW I DIDN'T I MY ONLY EXPERIENCE WITH THE SAFETY NET WAS UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE TIME. SO DIVIDE MYSELF WITH NOTHING I I'D HAD THE FORESIGHT AS WELL AS I WATCHED YOU KNOW MY SAVINGS AND ALL MY MONEY DISAPPEAR- YOU HAD ENOUGH TO MOVE WHAT FEW BELONGINGS WERE LEFT INTO. THE STORAGE UNIT THAT WAS WHERE I. I JUST THOUGHT SOMETHING WOULD RESCUE ME FROM THE INEVITABLE HOMELESSNESS OF COURSE NOTHING DID. AND I WAS THERE. AND WHAT I WANT TO SHARE IS THAT THE SAFETY NET WORK. OKAY IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT. AND THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS ISSUES I LOOK AT THINGS I'M CONCERNED WITH OUR THAT YOU KNOW THEY DE PRIORITIZATION OF WOMEN IN SO MANY OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE THAT WE SEE PUT TOGETHER- WE HEAR YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD NOT BE LIKE THAT. BUT THE COUNTY PLANNED THE AD THE CITY CAN'T THE HOMELESS INITIATIVE THERE WAS NOT ONE INITIALLY THERE WAS NOT ONE LINE ITEM FOR WOMEN EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AT ENTERING HOMELESSNESS. AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A RARE THAT MAY NOT RIVER THAT IS A UNIQUE CASE THAT. YOU KNOW SOLID DRAMA. AND THEN ANOTHER LEVEL OF TRAUMA ONCE WERE HOMELESS. AND. THE I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN EXPRESS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SUDDENLY FIND YOURSELF NINE O'CLOCK. AT NIGHT AND YOU HAVE NO WHERE TO GO NO FRIEND TO CALL COULD YOU RT COUCH SURFED RIGHT- AND- YOU ALREADY HAVE SERVED YOUR WAY THROUGH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND YOU'RE ALONE AND YOU'RE OUTSIDE. IT IS TRULY AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE AND. I AM I RESERVE SOLUTION WAS TO RIDE BUSES. WITH RIDE BUSES ALL NIGHT AND MAYBE IS A TEN THAT YOU KNOW OF IT GO TO THE OCCASIONAL OVERNIGHT LAUNDROMAT. AND. THOSE THAT IN THE BILL LINKAGE REALLY BETWEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE AND HOMELESSNESS IS THE STIGMA AND THE SHAME. INTENSA VERIS MEANT OF FEELINGS OF AND IT'S KIND OF MIRRORED BACK AT YOU WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE. WHILE I WAS EXPERIENCING THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE POLICE WOULD WOULD COME TO THE HOUSE THE FOCUS WAS NOT ON ME THE FOCUS WAS ON THE PERPETRATOR. SAME THING WHEN THE COURT SYSTEM THE FOCUS WAS NOT ON ME EXCEPT WAS I GOING TO BE A WITNESS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CASE THE FOCUS GIVE ME WAS ON THE PERPETRATOR- WHEN I FINALLY WAS BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT WAS DPSS WITH THE INSTITUTION A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES THAT GAVE ME THE FIRST FOCUS ON MYSELF. AND ASK ME THE QUESTIONS THAT ALLOWED ME TO START THE PATH OF RETURNING TO MY LIFE AS GETTING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES GETTING A CASE MANAGER. AND OF BEING AND I. WENT TO A SHELTER. AS FIRST WAS THE FOURTEEN DAY A VIRGIN SEE BAD. AND THEN I WAS RETURNED TO LIVING OUTSIDE WHAT WHAT I FOUND OUT AT THAT SHELTER THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THAT I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS MINIMUM TO GET HOUSING SERVICES. WAS REALLY. DEVASTATING. AND THAT'S THE THING THAT- I MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED CHRONICALLY HOMELESS IN ORDER TO BECAUSE OF THE NEED IS SO GREAT I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALL DO THAT THERE'S JUST SO MUCH NEED AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS ARE GREAT. BECAUSE THEY GET SOMEONE INSIDE OUT OF THIS WHICH I SPENT TIME UNDER. BUT WE CAN'T KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD WE HAVE TO AT SOME POINT AND BRACE THE NEED FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE IS DEEPLY TRAUMATIZED AND PEOPLE ARE FROM BEING HOMELESS FROM EXPERIENCING THAT ESPECIALLY THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERHAPS PRIOR TO THAT OVER 50% OF WOMEN. AT YOU KNOW ENTER HOMELESSNESS THROUGH DEVELOPER ISLAND. STAYING IN THE A TEMPORARY HOUSING IS VERY HOW DIFFICULT YOU NEVER YOU'RE ALWAYS WONDERING OKAY IS IT I MIGHT GET A BIG KICK TO IT TODAY MY LAST DAY IS TODAY MY LAST DAY. HAD DID I FILL THIS OUT THAT IS HERE'S THE FORM WHAT'S NEXT OKAY I'M GONNA TELL MY STORY FOR THE EIGHT HUNDRED TIME. THAT'S WHATEVER HOUSING IS LIKE. IT'S ONLY THROUGH PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT ACTUALLY FEELING OF SAFETY AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONSTANTLY WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND WONDER IS TODAY YOU KNOW MY GONNA BREAK SOME RULE IS THE FUNDING FOR IT DID THAT. IT MIGHT MAKE TO YOUR LIMIT WHATEVER IT IS AND I JUST WANTED CURRENT THAT WE DO NEED A LOT OF TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY. HOUSING AND SOLUTIONS. BUT NONE OF THEM ARE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE NONE OF THEM ARE HOUSING. I DID IT DID I DON'T KNOW THE I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK I WOULD LOOK AT A TINY HOME AND THINK OKAY THAT'S MY FUTURE. THAT'S GOING TO BE WHERE I'M GONNA RETIRE. ENDED SO MANY OF THESE TEMPER THESE- TEMPORARY SOLUTION YOU CANNOT HAVE GUESTS. YOU CANNOT HAVE OVERNIGHT GUESTS AND IF YOU DO IT'S FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME THAT'S NOT HOW A PEOPLE LIVE BUT THOSE OF US WHO GO THROUGH THIS YOU KNOW GONE THROUGH TERRIBLE THINGS END UP EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT IS WHAT OUR EXPERT THAT'S HOW WE HAVE TO. YOU KNOW WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE INSIDE DEFINITELY. BUT WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF DIGNITY. AND WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF. THESE ARE OUR NEIGHBORS AND THAT COULD BE ME THAT COULD BE MY NEPHEW THAT ONE OF THE- OF PEOPLE SPOKE AND SAID THAT I BELIEVE. THAT ONE OF THAT THAT ONE OF THEIR KIDS. OR GOD SENT WAS GOING THROUGH. OF HOMELESSNESS AND- METH ADDICTION. AND I'M SURE ALL OF US MUST KNOW SOMEONE GOING THROUGH THIS AND IF WE DON'T IT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SHARING IT. AND WE DON'T KNOW. SO IF ANYTHING I WOULD JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE MANY THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT IS GOING TO GO AWAY FAST AND I KNOW THERE'S URGENCY. BUT PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS WHAT SAVED ME. WITH THE LEVEL OF TRAUMA THAT I WAS THAT. I IT TOOK SIX MONTHS. FOR ME TAKE. A BEING IN A DEEP DEPRESSION ONCE I WITHOUT. I'VE ALMOST AND I'M SO SORRY- AT. TO FINALLY START LIVING THAT AND WEEK. AND ANYWAYS I'M JUSTGONNA SAY THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA. WE NEED TO HAVE SOLUTIONS LIKE PERMITS PART OF HOUSING THAT IS THE ONLY WAY. WHERE SOMEONE CAN ACTUALLY START RECOVERING AND REJOIN SOCIETY. BEING PRODUCTIVE SO THANKS FOR BEING HERE. HELLO THANK YOU FOR COMING COMING TODAY AND- GIVING YOUR TESTIMONY AND STATEMENTS THEY'RE VERY POWERFUL. AND I CERTAINLY HEAR YOU VERY LOUD I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF A CONVERSATION THE SET ALL THINGS ON THE TABLE BECAUSE YOU NEED MORE. BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CONVERSATION WAS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE OTHER BUT BUT- AND WITH THE POLL REFLECTS. BUT BUT BUT THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH OF LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY IS VERY POWERFUL INSTRUCTIVE TO THE WHAT WORKS. AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK- WHEN PROVIDING- AND HELPING PEOPLE TO BE HEALTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL THE SOLUTIONS ARE IMPORTANT AS PART OF THIS YOU KNOW WE NEED TEMPORARY LEVEL WAITING FOR THE PERMIT I DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT THAT YEAH. YEAH BUT I WOULD LIKE TO COME. DOWN LANDING A ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT WHAT WORKS APPROACH AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK IN APPROACH- FROM A USER PERSPECTIVE BUT I THINK THAT. THAT. PIECE CAN'T GET LOST AND I ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES. I JUST HAD TO- ONE QUESTION TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT I SUSPECTED WHICH IS THAT- THE- THE STATISTIC OR THE SURVEY RESULT THAT- ON ON FROM THE BUSINESS COUNCIL THAT THAT YOU FOUND THAT FIFTY ONE PERCENT- THIS WOULD SUPPORT EIGHT ANOTHER. TAX INCREASE- IT IF I RECALL CORRECTLY THAT NUMBER IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE PERCENTAGE OF VOTERS THAT SUPPORTED MEASURES HM MEASURES HHH DO YOU DO YOU SEE A TREND IN TERMS OF- YEAH I THINK OVERALL- THE SURVEY HIGHLIGHTED THERE'S. THERE'S GROWING FRUSTRATION AND THAT AND IT'S REFLECTED IN. VOTERS WILLINGNESS TO TAX THEMSELVES WITHOUT A PLAN AND IT'S EVEN. WITH THE COPY OUT THAT THERE IS. THAT YOU PUT FORWARD A PLAN THAT'S CLEAR THAT'S ACCOUNTABLE THAT HAS TRANSPARENCY IT'S STILL A LITTLE LOW. MAJORITY 63% IS A MAJORITY BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT CONSIDERED- WHAT I GUESS A SLAM DUNK WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ENACT SOME SORT OF NEW TAX MEASURE- SO I DO BELIEVE THERE IS. THIS FRUSTRATION HAS HAS CREATED AMONG VOTERS. A LITTLE BIT MORE WARINESS IN TERMS OF SPENDING MORE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY WANT TO SEE THE PROBLEM SOLVED NOW. WHICH I GUESS YOU COULD SEE AS BEING SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVE- BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THEY ARE STILL WILLING IT'S JUST. THERE HAS TO BE A CLEAR PLAN CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY CLEAR TRANSPARENCY SO THEY KNOW THAT WHEN THEY'RE WHEN WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY IT'S GOING TO THINGS THAT THEY THEY SEE OR FEEL ARE GOING TO MAKE AN IMPACT. IN A SENSE. THANK YOU N. DON'T KNOW FOR THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE TO- PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS I BELIEVE- AND YOU'RE AT THE POINT TO ME MARYLAND WHERE THE PUBLIC COMMENT MIKE IS HOW MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH BY THE WAY THEY.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ALICIA ROAD IN. I AM A- VACCINE AMBASSADOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE- DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER. WHICH MEANS THAT I'M ALSO A COMMUNITY SERVICE WORKER. I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WOMEN GET SERVICES. EVERY COMMUNITY SERVICE WORKER I SEE WOMEN LIVING IN TENTS. I SEE WOMEN WITH CHILDREN. THAT IS TRAUMA. THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE FUNDING. WHY DO I SAY THAT I'VE BEEN HOMELESS. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT WITH KIDS. IT IS SO IMPORTANT WHAT I SEE. OUR THREE SENIORS EVERY DAY. HER NAME SOME CAN'T GET MEDICAL CARE WE HAVE TO BE ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE HOUSING. AND THE WAY THAT PEOPLE GET IS SCARY I SEE SOME PEOPLE WHEN I GO INTO THE ROOM KEYS OF PLACES OR THE DIFFERENT SHELTERS SAY I WOULD RATHER GO BACK AND LIVE IN THE TENT IF I HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME. THAT IS NOT FAIR. I DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT I WAS HELPED. THIS CENTER HERE HAS HELPED MANY PEOPLE IT HELPS ME I'M SIXTY ONE YEARS AGO I GET TO GO OUT EVERY DAY HELP PEOPLE HELP THEM GET RESOURCES HELP THEM ALSO LEARN ABOUT CODING. I ACCESS THAT PEOPLE HELP WOMEN ARE FEARFUL MANNER FEARFUL AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE BABIES EVERYDAY WHEN I COME TO WORK SOMETIMES I SEE WOMEN WITH FIVE OR SIX BABIES. THAT'S A HEARING WHO ARE NAKED. THERE NEEDS TO BE MET MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES GO TO THOSE STUDENTS. YES THERE'S BEEN SOME GOOD. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE. BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THIS EVERY DAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM FOR YOUR PUBLIC COMMENTS WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. I BELIEVE WE HAD ANOTHER DIGITAL. THERE YOU GO MAN THANK YOU. EARLY IN MY BAG I JUST WANT. EVERYBODY WITH GREAT. SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY SO. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT BUDGETING. AND HI FOLKS WHO LIKE PEOPLE THAT WERE SITTING HERE BEFORE ABOUT BUDGETING. AND. I WAS KERN OFFENDED WHEN THEY SAID THAT. IT WASN'T A PLAN. TO HAVE A STRUCTURE IN THIS WAY RIGHT MY NAME IS CHRIS THORNBERG AS- AND- OUR APPROACH THEM BECAUSE SOMEONE HAD. INITIALLY TOLD ME TO COME DOWN TO THE WOMEN'S CENTER FOR HOUSING. I WAS HERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN I WAS ONLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AMBIENCE I STAYED OUTSIDE. UNTIL BY SAY TWO YEARS I WAS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. N. EIGHTEEN THEN I WAS AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT SHELTERS THAT THEY PUT YOU IN A BUS AND THEY RUN YEAR ROUND RAIN DEATH IT JUST LIKE A CAUGHT. N. SO THEY FOUND OUT THAT I WAS EDUCATED BECAUSE I HAVE TO RETEST HERE AT THE LEARNING CENTER SO THEY HAVE A LEARNING CENTER HERE WHERE THERE'S COMPUTER THIS THOUGH BUT THE COMPUTERS THEY HAD WAS IN REALLY A LEGIT THING SO I HAVE TO GO TO BMW. AND INVEST IN SOME MORE COMPUTERS WHICH THEY HAVE BRAND NEW COMPUTERS AND LEARNING CENTER NOW. SO THEN ONCE THAT BECAME ESTABLISH THE COMPUTERS THAT THE THINGS THAT THE SOFTWARES AND ALL THAT STUFF BECAME MORE COMPATIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO DO A CONSTRUCTION OR A STRETCHING WAY HERE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY TO INVEST IN TO HELP PEOPLE WITH THOSE THINGS THEN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY PIPELINE. SO MUCH THAT WAS CREATED. PEOPLE START TO BE YOU CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHICH IS LEGAL JOBS A LITTLE BIT OVER TWO MINUTES JUST TO PASS SO BASICALLY OKAY BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS.

AND IF YOU IF YOU DO HAVE A BUDGET THEN WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW TO ME WHAT IS THE PLAN. I WISH I SHOW THEM A BUDGET THEY MAKE THINGS HAPPEN YOU KNOW TO ME SO IT'S LIKE. OUR APPROACH PEOPLE THEY LIKE ALL WE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING HERE. I'M LIKE HE'S WILL BE WORKING HERE THEY LIKE YEAH. SO WHAT I DID WAS I DID LIKE THIS. THEY START WORKING THATFAST. NO PROBLEM NO NO INFORMATION NO NOTHING I MEAN LIKE HE SAID NO PLAN. I DON'T GIVE THEM NO MY NAME HE CAN GIVE ME HIS NAME HE JUST ARE WORKING. SO IT'S NOT REALLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR WHAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE BEEN. ABLE TO JUST HAPPEN YOU KNOW I MEAN AND I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CALLING AS ONE OF THE FAIR TO EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE SAID EVERYBODY TWO MINUTES AND I DON'T WANT TO. GO TOO FAR.
