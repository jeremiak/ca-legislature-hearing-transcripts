SO LASTLY ON THE FINAL PAGE ON

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT COULD THIS ALL MEAN FOR

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IF LOCAL

JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS I

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:52.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STATE SUPREME COURT ONLY ACCEPTS

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT TWO PERCENT OF THE CASES.

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
THAT ARE.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BUT BEFORE THEN.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:01.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE THE

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:02.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
RATE THAT.

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT AT WHICH THEY ACCEPT CASES

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:05.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:06.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU YEAH

SO I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM IT.

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:15.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
BUT TO.

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SINCE THE SUPREME COURT ENDED

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:19.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UP AGREEING WITH THE APPELLATE

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:20.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COURT THEY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:22.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
TAKE THE CASE A GUY JUST SAID
NO.

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO I'M JUST CURIOUS. IF YOU KNOW

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHY THEY TOOK THE CASE AND IF

QUESTION ON THE SUPREME COURT

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:20.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAS THREE AREAS OF PRACTICE THAT

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CASES WHICH THEY MUST TAKE.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CIVIL CASES WHICH THEY CHOOSE

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FROM AND CRIMINAL CASES LESS

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:25.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAN DEATH WHICH THEY CHOOSE

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:27.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FROM. THEY GET SOMETHING LIKE

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NINE THOUSAND CIVIL PETITIONS A

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:30.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEAR AND THEY TAKE ABOUT TWO

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:32.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PERCENT OF THOSE CASES SO THE

00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:33.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DATE OF YOUR TALK ABOUT OUR

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CIVIL CASES INCLUDING THESE.

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:37.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THIS CASE WAS MOOT WHEN THE

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:40.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SUPREME COURT DECIDED IT.

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE THE VOTERS OF UPLAND

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:45.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVERY DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL BY A

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:45.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN.

00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:46.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SUPREME COURT TOOK THE CASE

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:46.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ANYWAY AND THEY TOOK IT UNDER A

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:47.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RULE OF COURT WHICH EXPLAINS

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
WHAT HOW THEY.

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
APPLY THEIR RESOURCES TO SERVE

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:52.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA.

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE ESSENCE OF THE RULE IS

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:55.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE BASE DECIDE PARTICULARLY

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:57.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND THEY

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN THE LAW. I

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:00.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE HAD THAT

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS IS EASILY CHARACTERIZED AS

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:03.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A CONFLICT IN THE LAW AT THE

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:04.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TIME THAT THE COURT APPEAL HAD

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
DECIDED IT.

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:07.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO I THINK THEY MUST DETERMINE

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:08.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IT WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:09.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
QUESTION.

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE'S ANOTHER IRONY IN THIS

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CASE AND THAT IS THAT THE THE

00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:15.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
SEED OF THE IDEA.

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO DISTINGUISH THE VOTERS ACTING

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:18.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BY INITIATIVE A FROM THE

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:20.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOVERNMENT CAME FROM ANIMAGUS

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:22.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BRIEF WRITTEN BY REALLY FINE

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIRM IN LOS ANGELES ON BEHALF OF

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:25.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE CHARGERS WHO HAD A MEASURE

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:27.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ON THE BALLOT. TO FINANCE A NEW

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:29.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOOTBALL STADIUM AND AFTER THAT

00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:31.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MEASURE DIDN'T HE GET EVEN FIFTY

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:32.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PERCENT MUCH LESS TWO THIRDS.

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:34.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE AUTHOR OF THE BRIEF TRY TO

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITHDRAW IT BUT THE DEED WAS

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:38.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DONE THE IDEA WAS PLANTED IN IT

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT GREW INTO WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:41.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
US TODAY SO THERE LOTS OF.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONTINGENCIES OF HISTORY WITH

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:44.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
BEFORE US.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I WANT TO COVER UP BRIEFLY

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:48.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU JUST HEARD

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:48.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
PERSPECTIVE.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES ARE SO

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:53.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOROUGHLY REGULATED THESE DAYS

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BY THE WORK OF GENERATIONS OF

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INITIATIVE DRAFTERS THAT. WE

00:16:58.417 --> 00:16:59.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EACH TYPE OF REVENUES SQUARELY

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:02.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
COMPLIES WITH A BUNCH OF

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
COMPLICATED RULES. SO A

REGULATORY FEE ON A MARIJUANA

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:07.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISPENSARY TO COVER THE LOCAL

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOVERNMENTS COSTS TO REGULATE

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:11.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT SPENDS THREE MUST BE SHOWN

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO RECOVER ONLY THOSE COSTS. AND

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF THERE'S EXTRA MONEY IN THE

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:16.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

REQUIRING VOTER APPROVAL.

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:19.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HERE YOU HAD A SITUATION WHICH

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:21.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAD A CITY COUNCIL SERVING A

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:22.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COMMUNITY THAT DID NOT WANT

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ADOPTED A BAM. THOSE WHO

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:28.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DISAGREE WITH THAT POLICY

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROPOSED INITIATIVE. PERHAPS FOR

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POLITICAL REASONS TO TRY TO MAKE

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:33.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE MEASURE MORE SALEABLE AND TO

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:34.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEFEAT AN ARGUMENT THAT IT WAS

00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:36.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOING TO COST THE CITY MONEY.

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:37.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PUT IN THIS PROVISION THAT SAID

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:38.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEVENTY FIVE GRAND PER YEAR PER

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:42.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:44.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FATHERS AND MOTHERS SO TO SPEAK

HAVE THE STAFF TO AN ALLISON

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:46.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAID WHEN I CAN SPEND ANYWHERE

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NEAR THAT WE SPEND ABOUT TEN

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEREFORE IT'S A GENERAL TAX AND

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEREFORE WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:53.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THIS. ON A SPECIAL ELECTION

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:55.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BALLOTWE CAN PUT IT ON OUR NEXT

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GENERAL EX IN BALANCE WHICH WAS

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:57.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT THAT POINT WAS MORE THAN TWO

00:17:57.776 --> 00:17:59.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEARS AWAY. AND EVERYONE ON THIS

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:00.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BODY KNOWS THE TIMING IS

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:02.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVERYTHING AND POLITICS AND THAT

THAT IT DID.

00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:44.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT I MOST OFTEN SAY ABOUT

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:46.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UPLAND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS AN

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:47.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ADVOCATE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I SHOULD DISCLOSE I WROTE IN

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ANY CASE BRIEF IN THE CASE ON

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:50.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BEHALF OF THE LEAD CALIFORNIA

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:53.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CITIES? AND WE HAD UNCOMMON

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMON CAUSE WITH HOWARD JARVIS

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:57.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN THIS CASE BECAUSE CITIES FEAR

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BOARD LEADS THE LEAGUE OF CITIES

00:18:59.204 --> 00:19:01.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FEARS. THAT IF IT'S TOO EASY TO

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROPOSE SPECIAL TAXES AND TOO

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:04.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HARD TO POST GNERAL TAXES IN

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:06.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POLITICAL TERMS. THAT SPECIAL

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:08.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TAXES WILL PROLIFERATE AND WE

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:09.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WILL BE TIED DOWN IN OUR

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:10.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUDGETING BY A THOUSAND TINY

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LITTLE PATIENCE STRAINS. AND THE

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:14.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
UNSEXY NECESSARY GENERAL

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOVERNMENT LIKE LEGAL FEES AND

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:17.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INSURANCE POLICIES AND RENT AND

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:19.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE LIGHTING WILL NOT BE FUNDED

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:20.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE TOUCH

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND FEEL AND CARE ABOUT. OBVIOUS

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:24.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SERVICE DELIVERY WILL BE AND

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:26.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:27.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
RUN GOVERNMENT IN A RATIONAL
WAY.

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:29.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO WE HAD COMMON CAUSE WITH OUR

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:31.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DRIVERS IN THIS CASE AND I THINK

00:19:31.703 --> 00:19:32.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT BOTH THE

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:35.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEAGUE AND HOWARD JARVIS WERE

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:35.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISAPPOINTED BY THE RESULT.

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE. BUT AS I USUALLY SAY ABOUT

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:38.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THIS CASE IT'S MUCH LESS

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:41.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IMPORTANT WHAT IT SAYS.

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:43.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEN WHAT IT MIGHT PORTEND ABOUT

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE TREND OF THIS COURT AND THIS

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AREA A PUBLIC POLICY MAKING.

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE DECISION

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS IN MY JUDGMENT ON HELPFULLY

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
BROUGHT.

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:54.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE SUPREME COURT KEEPS

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:56.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REFERRING TO SECTION TWO OR

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:57.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SECTION TO SUBDIVISION DE WELL

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:59.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVEN SECTION TWO SUBDIVISION BE

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:00.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE A PROP

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO EIGHTEEN HAS FIVE DISTINCT

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RULES IN IT. THERE FIVE DISTINCT

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:07.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IDEAS THAT REGULATE LOCAL

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOVERNMENT IN THAT ONE PARAGRAPH

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO BY REFERRING TO THIS BOX

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:12.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THINGS WHEN REALLY ONLY ONE

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ELEMENT WAS IN ISSUE CREATED THE

PORTENTOUS NIS THAT FOLKS ARE

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:18.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
WORRIED ABOUT.

00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:19.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOWARD JARVIS WROTE A PETITION

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:21.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR REHEARING IN THE CASE WHICH

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:22.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COURT

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:23.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO ADJUST ITS OPINION AFTER THE

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DECISION WAS MADE. AND THE COURT

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:27.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SUBJECTIVELY DECLINED THE

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:29.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INVITATION UNLESS THE RELATIVELY

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%

DECISION ON THE BOOKS.

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE NEXT STEP IN THIS STORY FROM

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MY PERSPECTIVE ARM IS A CASE

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:38.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT I HANDLED ARMEN STILL

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:41.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
HANDLING FOR THE CITY OF
VENTURA.

AND THIS IS A DISPUTE OVER

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:43.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GROUNDWATER AUGMENTATION CHARGES

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THE CITY PAYS TO TAKE WATER

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:46.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUT OF THE GROUND WATER TABLE TO

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:47.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SERVE ITS CONSTITUENTS.

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:50.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WAS LITIGATED UNDER PROP

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:52.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWO EIGHTEEN AND PROP UP TWENTY

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:53.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
SIX.

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I WON IN THE TRIAL COURT LOST

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN THE COURT OF APPEAL SUCCEEDED

00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN GETTING THAT TO PERCENT SHOT

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO THE SUPREME COURT. AND THE

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:01.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COURT SAID IN A VERY NARROW

00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:03.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DECISION THAT I THINK REFLECTS

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:04.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE FACT THAT THIS IS A THREE

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THREE COURT IN PARTISAN TERMS IF

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:07.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU WANT TO VIEW IT THAT WAY AND

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE HAVE A VACANCY THAT THE

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOVERNOR WILL FELT. BY JANUARY

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:13.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOURTH I IMAGINE I'M PERHAPS NOT

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:13.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SOONER.

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:15.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT SOME VERY NARROW DECISION

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:17.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL THE DECISIONS THAT WAS ITS

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TWENTY SIX NOT TO EIGHTEEN GO

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BACK TO THE TRIAL COURT AND

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIGURE OUT WHETHER YOU PASS THAT

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:22.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
TEST OR NOT.

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:23.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE REASON I'M MENTIONING THE

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CASE IS THAT THERE WAS A

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FOOTNOTE IN THE ORIGINAL

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:28.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

BY PROP TWO EIGHTEEN BECAUSE

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:39.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROP THIRTEEN IS LIMITED TO

SPECIAL TAXES WITHOUT TWO THIRDS

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE COURT GOT THREE REQUESTS

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISTRICT. SO ULTIMATELY I THINK

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT IT'S GONNA DEPEND IN OUR VIEW

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:45.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ON WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT AT

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOME POINT THE FUTURE OR THE

00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:49.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEGISLATURE OR THE VOTERS EXTEND

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

SPECIAL TAXES.

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:55.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THE

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:57.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UPLAND DECISION ON TAXPAYERS.

00:26:57.515 --> 00:26:59.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BASICALLY THAT DECISION

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REQUIRES CITIES AND COUNTIES TO

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:03.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ORDER A SPECIAL THIS ELECTION ON

00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:05.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ASUS IS INITIATED MEASURE THAT

00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:07.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RECEIVES IT REQUISITE NUMBER.

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:08.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:09.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE LECTURES CODE IN THAT IN

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:10.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THAT REGARD.

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:12.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF COURT LATER TERM IS THAT THE

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALBUM DECISION EXTENDS TO THE

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS OF

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:17.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE CONSTITUTION ARTICLE TWO.

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:18.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE SECTION
TWO.

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:21.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SUBDIVISIONS A ND THAN ANY

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CITIZENS INITIATIVE PROPOSE A

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:24.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TAX WOULD ONLY REQUIRE THE

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:24.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
APPROVAL OF A MAJORITY THE

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUALIFIED VOTERS. SO AGAIN I

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:27.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THINK WE NEED TO HAVE

00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:29.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
CLARIFICATIONS BEFORE THE
COURTS.

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:32.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEFORE WE EXTEND THAT CONCEPT.

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:33.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE THERE ANY OTHER POTENTIAL

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:34.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSEQUENCES WELL THINKING LIKE

00:27:35.053 --> 00:27:37.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A BOND ATTORNEY. I'M GONNA THINK

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:38.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ABOUT IF THERE IS OF THE

00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:40.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CITIZENS INITIATIVE. AND THE

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:42.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REVENUES FROM THOSE TAXES ARE

00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:44.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GOING TO BE USED TO SECURE

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SECURITY BONDED INDEBTEDNESS.

00:27:45.897 --> 00:27:47.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'M GONNA HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF OPINIONS ARE

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:50.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE PROVIDED

00:27:50.935 --> 00:27:52.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WITH REGARD TO THOSE BONDS.

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:55.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU HAVE TO. GIVE OPINIONS WITH

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REGARD TO THE VALIDITY BONDS

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH BACING

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOSE BONDS AS WELL AS PROVIDING

00:28:00.678 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT WHICH

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:04.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
ABOUT THE SECURITY FOR THE
BONDS.

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:07.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS WELL AS ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:09.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS AND

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:11.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CERTAINLY THERE'LL HAVE TO BE A

00:28:11.222 --> 00:28:13.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOT OF INFORMATION PROVIDED. IF

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:15.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU ARE GOING TO RELY UPON THE

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:17.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
EXTEND THE CONCEPT.

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:19.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

BY THOSE TAXES. SO AGAIN I THINK

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:27.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THERE'S RISK TO. OUR LOCAL

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:30.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AGENCIES FIRST AND FOREMOST I

00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:31.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT THE SUBJECTIVITY LITIGATION.

00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DO

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:38.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK AT THIS TIME YOU KNOW.

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:43.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHETHER NOT YOU PROVIDE ANY

BE HELPFUL IS UNCERTAIN I THINK.

00:29:01.773 --> 00:29:03.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ULTIMATELY I THINK THE DECISION

00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:04.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WILL HAVE TO BE FURTHER

TO BE GOVERNED BY THE SAME RULES

OF THOSE DECISIONS AND SO FAR AS

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT STOOD FOR THE FACT THAT THE

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:29.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VOTERS COULD USE THE INITIATIVE

PRINCIPLE THAT YOU SHOULD

STRAIGHTFORWARD DECISION. THOUGH

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STRANGE WAY THIS CASE GOT TO THE

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:00.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
COURT.

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:01.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS ADDED TO THE I I HAVE NO

COMMENT ABOUT THAT AND I HAVE NO

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:05.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOTHING CAN HOLD UNDERSTANDING

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%

PROCEDURAL POSTURE. I DO

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:17.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DIDN'T

OFFICIAL HOLDING ON THE CASE

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEFORE YOU. BUT I THINK THIS AT

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:25.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CISCO CITY ATTORNEY IS CORRECT

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:25.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT BASED ON THE BROAD

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRINCIPLES THE COURT HAS APPLIED

00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:28.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REGULARLY I'M AND NEW TRULY BOTH

OPPONENTS OF TAX MEASURES IN THE

00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:32.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONTEXT OF THE INITIATIVE POWER.

UPLAND WAS CORRECTLY DECIDED

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:35.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND THAT ONE DAY IT IS VERY

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LIKELY THAT THE SUPREME COURT

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:40.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WILL GO THE NEXT STEP AND FIND.

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:42.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THE SPECIAL TAX RULES ALSO

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:43.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NOT GOVERNED BY I'M A SUPER

00:32:43.494 --> 00:32:45.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAJORITY. THAT IS WHAT I THINK

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:47.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ACT

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:47.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ON THAT.

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:49.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT THIS POINT IS A DIFFERENT

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:51.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

POLICY QUESTION RIGHT SO IF IT'S

00:32:57.542 --> 00:33:00.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TRUE. THAT SOMETIME SOON.

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:02.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:08.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH IS ON THE BALLOT HOUSE THE

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEGISLATURE APPROACH THAT. AND I

00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:13.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK THE CONCERNS. THAT THERE

00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW THE LOCAL TAXING POWER WOULD

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:21.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BE USED AND THE LEGISLATURES

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:28.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROPER ROLE. IS TO CHANNEL THAT

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:32.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
POWER RIGHT SO. AND THIS IS

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
GOING GOING TO.

THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT READING CITY

OF UP ON THE FIRST THING THAT

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STRUCK ME ABOUT IT WAS THE COURT

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MISSED ALL THE EXIT SIGNS. IT

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WAS MOVED WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

FACT THAT THE CASE ITSELF WAS

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:48.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MOVED. BUT THE QUESTION REALLY

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:50.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BEFORE THE COURT WASN'T ABOUT

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:51.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:54.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
QUESTION FOR THE COURT WAS

00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:57.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY. WAS IN

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:58.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ITS RIGHTS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE

FEET WAS LABELED A FEE. AND THE

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COURT MAKE IN THIS CASE SAYS. IT

00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:08.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WASN'T THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:11.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CITY TO DO TO. ORDAIN THAT THAT

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:15.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WAS A TAX AND THEREBY PUT IT ON.

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:17.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE GENERAL BALLOT PURSUANT TO

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:19.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE CONSTITUTION. YOU COULD EVEN

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:21.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAKE THE ARGUMENT THE QUESTION

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:22.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAS WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY.

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WAS BOUND BY THE STATUTORY

00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:28.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REQUIREMENTS PUT ON SPECIAL

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:29.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ACTIONS PUTS THE GENERAL

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:33.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ELECTION. BUT THE CORDON STATUS

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:34.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHILE AND THEY DECIDE TO GO TO

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:38.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS LARGER QUESTION ABOUT WHAT

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:39.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE DEFINITION LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
MEANS.

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:43.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THEN WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE A

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUESTION THEY REFUSED TO ANSWER

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:47.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THEY

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REFUSED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:52.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:41:53.043 --> 00:41:53.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THAT DECISION.

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:54.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN SO WHEN IT WHEN THEIR THEIR

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:55.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POSTS I THINK WITH PROBABLY THE

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:55.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EASIEST QUESTION WHICH WAS.

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:56.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ASSUMING THAT A LOCAL VOTER

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INITIATIVE GROUP A LOCAL WATER

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:02.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
GROUP PROPOSED INITIATIVE. TO
WHICH I I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AN EASY CASE OCCURRED OF SIMPLY

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:04.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SAID WILL OF COURSE HAVE TO PUT

00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:06.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ON THE ON THE ON TH BALLOT

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE IT'S A VOTER INITIATIVE

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:09.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S THE NATURE OF THE PROCESS.

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:10.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THEY DIDN'T ASK THE MORE

00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:11.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIFFICULT QUESTION WHICH WAS IF

00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:13.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEANS WHAT THEY

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE DETERMINED AT WHAT THEY

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HAVE SAID IT MEANS IN THE

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:18.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONTEXT OF. THIS QUESTION WHAT

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:19.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DOES IT MEAN FOR ARTICLE

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:21.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIRTEEN C. AND D. GENERALLY OR

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DIFFERENT INHERENT TAXING

THROUGH LEGISLATIVE ACTS SO

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SCOPE OF WHAT THEY CAN DO IS

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:23.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SOMEWHAT.

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RESTRICTED BY STATUTE. BUT BUT

THAT SAID I GUESS THE THE PART

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT THAT I

WORRY ABOUT WE WERE ACTUALLY

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:31.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS FASTER

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:32.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
MY.

00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:34.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEFORE IS THAT THE IDEA OF THE

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:36.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT IS.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

MINORITY GROUPS OR INSULAR

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:45.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GROUPS. AND WE'VE HAD A KIND OF

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:47.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HISTORY LAST I THINK TEN OR

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:49.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TWENTY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA OF.

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:51.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF TARGETING PARTICULAR GROUPS

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:53.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RENSSELAER TAXATION IT'S A WAY

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:55.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF FUNDING. SOMETIMES BROAD

00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:57.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POPULAR PROGRAMS BUT WE TARGET

00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:59.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNPOPULAR GROUPS AND THE TWO

00:49:59.196 --> 00:49:59.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT THINK

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROTECTS AGAINST THAT TO SOME

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:02.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DEGREE AND I THINK. YOU

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ELIMINATION OF THAT PROTECTION

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:06.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS GOING YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:07.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ESPECIALLY WHEN SPECIAL

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:09.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY HAVE THE TAKING COMPETING

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:23.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INTERESTS WHEREAS. NOW WE'RE

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SETTING UP A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE

A SPECIAL INTEREST MIGHT. HAVE

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:30.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAD A DESIRE FOR SPENDING BUT

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:46.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEEN A POLICY IN CALIFORNIA OUT

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:48.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FRANKLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:51.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LASTED TEN TWENTY YEARS AND I

00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:53.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:57.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RATCHET UP IF THIS. IF THE COURT

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:59.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TAKES UP THE CHALLENGE AND AND

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:02.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ULTIMATELY SAYS THAT LOCAL

GOVERNMENT.

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:09.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'M SORRY LOCAL FURNISHES ARE

INITIATIVE OF LOCAL TAX

INITIATIVE WITH THAT IT COULD I

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:27.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MEAN I THINK THAT THAT'S THE

00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:28.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HISTORY I MEAN I HAVING BEEN

00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:30.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

THAT'S WHAT ITS PURPOSE WAS PART

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:32.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TWENTY SIX DID TO YOU. REALLY

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:34.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THREE THINGS THAT. ADDRESS THE

00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:36.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SINCLAIR PAIN DECISION IT

ARTICLE THIRTEEN IS SECTION

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:41.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THREE AS TO WHETHER THE

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:42.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
LEGISLATURE COULD PASS.

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:44.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
EIGHT ATTACKS THAT WAS

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:46.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OSTENSIBLY REVENUE NEUTRAL BUT

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:47.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SHIFTED OBLIGATIONS AMONGST

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:50.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GROUPS. ARM AND THEN IT SHIFTED

00:51:50.674 --> 00:51:52.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE BURDEN PROOF FOR FOR

00:51:52.509 --> 00:51:54.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DEFENDING A SUIT CHALLENGING

WHETHER A A NEW POSITIONS

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:58.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ATTACKS HER FEET. BUT CRITICS

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WAS SPECIFICALLY AN ANSWER TO

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:01.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THOSE QUESTIONS AND AND I

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:05.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SUSPECT THERE WILL BE AN ANSWER

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:05.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
TO THIS AS WELL.

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:07.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THANK YOU.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:08.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO COME IN APART FROM ANY LEGAL

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:08.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IMITATION THERE ARE TWO

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:09.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS ON THE

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:09.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABILITY TO RAISE REVENUE FOR

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:11.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOVERNMENT ONE IS EVERYTHING

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:13.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REQUIRES VOTER APPROVAL AND EVEN

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:14.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A FIFTY PERCENT STANDARD IS NOT

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:15.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AN EASY SELL BECAUSE VOTERS

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:16.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THEIR

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:17.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POCKET BOOK ABOUT LIKE IT TO

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:18.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
STAY. THERE.

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SECONDLY THERE ARE ECONOMIC

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND ADMINISTRATIVE REALITIES YOU

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:23.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HAVE TO HAVE THE ECONOMIC

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTIVITY IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:26.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REASONABLY

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:27.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EFFICIENT WAY TO TAX IT BUT I'LL

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:29.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
CHASING IT OUT OF YOUR
COMMUNITY.

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:31.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE STATE

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SALES TAX AND WE HAVE TO RELY ON

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:35.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE STATE TO OPERATE THAT TAX.

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:36.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUSINESS LICENSE TAX AND SET UP

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:40.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AN ENGINE TO DO IT AND UTILITY

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:41.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TAXES RELY ON THE UTILITY

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:44.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMPANIES BUT WHEN YOU START TO

00:52:44.127 --> 00:52:44.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THINK MORE.

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:46.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE BROADLY IT'S HARD YOU HAD

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:47.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO SET UP A WHOLE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:52:47.797 --> 00:52:50.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SYSTEM IN EACH OF THE FOUR

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:50.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HUNDRED EIGHY CITIES IN

00:52:51.034 --> 00:52:52.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CALIFORNIA IN FIFTY EIGHT

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:53.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COUNTIES IN ORDER TO CHASE WHAT

00:52:54.037 --> 00:52:55.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MIGHT BE AND ITS REVENUE. SO

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:57.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PRACTICALLY THE ECONOMY AND THE

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:59.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ECONOMICS OF TAXATION LIMIT OUR

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:01.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CHOICES.

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:02.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE WHAT YOU AS A COMMITTEE

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:06.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHAIRMAN OF THAT QUICKLY. SHUTS.

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
WHICH I CAN WHICH GOES TO WHY
IF.

00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:09.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THIS WERE TO BE A.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF WE WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN OR

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:12.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT LEAST IT DID HAPPEN HERE THE

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:13.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REASON TO PROVIDE STANDARDIZED

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:16.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BASIS AND SO IN ORDER AND

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:17.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CAPTAIN MILLER CHURCH.

00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:19.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AROUND THIS PROBLEM IN TERMS OF

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:20.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT I WOULD TO SAY SOMETHING

00:53:20.797 --> 00:53:22.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABOUT THE TWO THE TWO THIRDS

00:53:22.732 --> 00:53:23.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
RULE AND.

00:53:23.366 --> 00:53:25.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RECENT HISTORY OF TAXATION IN

00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:27.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CALIFORNIA IT IS TRUE THAT

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:28.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THERE'S NOW BEEN BALLOT BOX

00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:29.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUDGIE WHERE PEOPLE ARE THERE

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:31.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOW THINGS ON THE BUDGET THAT'S

00:53:31.274 --> 00:53:32.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVER GOING TO RAISE THE SPECIFIC

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:35.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TAXES FOR THE SPECIFIC. PROJECT

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:36.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:36.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
RIGHT.

00:53:36.846 --> 00:53:37.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE ARE POST PROP THIRTEEN

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:40.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PHENOMENON RIGHT THERE BECAUSE

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:41.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T DO TAX

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:43.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POLICY BECAUSE OF THE TWO THIRDS

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
RULES.

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:45.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
YOU NOW HAVE BALLOT BOX

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:49.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUDGETING NOW I'M NOT AS DOW.

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M NOT THE DIRECTOR'S. IT'S A

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:52.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMPLICATED QUESTION BUT IT'S

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:53.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WORTH UNDERSTANDING BOTH SIDES

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:54.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF IT RIGHT AND AND FROM MY

00:53:54.497 --> 00:53:56.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERSPECTIVE IF THERE'S GOING TO

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BE A SPECIAL RULE MAKE IT VERY

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:00.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HARD TO RAISE TAXES. IF THERE'S

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO BE A RULE LIKE THAT AND

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:02.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK THAT AGAIN THERE'S SOME

00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:04.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ABSOLUTE

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:06.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIRST GOT PAST TO BE. BEFORE YOU

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:08.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LOCK THE DOOR MAKE SURE THE

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:09.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TAXES DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE IS

00:54:09.879 --> 00:54:13.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BROAD STABLE AND WELL DESIGNED.

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:14.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE ISSUE OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT WE. COULD LOCK THE DOOR

00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:18.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN THE SYSTEM WAS UNSTABLE AND

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:20.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POORLY DESIGNED AND THAT'S THE

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:22.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SITUATION WE'RE IN NOW BUT WE

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:24.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE A HARD TIME CHANGING. A

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:25.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEM THAT'S NOT WELL DESIGNED

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:26.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:28.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FLEXIBILITY TO CHANGE IT WHILE

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALSO TAKING DUMB TO MEASURE UP

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:34.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE CONCERNS OF UP UP AN ARTICLE

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:35.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
TO BE PROTECTED.

00:54:35.705 --> 00:54:38.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THANK YOU MISSILE.

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:39.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I JUST ECHO MICHAEL'S COMMENT

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:40.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT IN A MAJORITY OF HER

00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:42.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPROVAL IS NOT A SIMPLE THINGS

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:44.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO EVEN IF IT IS FOR SPECIAL

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:45.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPECIAL PURPOSE. IS INITIATED BY

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:47.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
VOTERS THEY STOPPED ME THAT

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:48.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THRESHOLD.

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:50.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND ULTIMATELY IT IS THE VOTERS

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHOICE IF THEY WANT TO WANT TO

00:54:52.188 --> 00:54:53.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOW THE TAX WITHOUT THEY WON'T

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:10.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ROOM. AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:12.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BEING INVOLVED IN COUNTY

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:14.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOVERNMENT TO BRING INTO YOUR

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:15.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIRM TWENTY. ON MANY OF THE BORG

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:16.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMITMENTS AND MICHAEL I THINK

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:18.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE GO BACK TO THE ORANGE COUNTY

VECTOR CONTROL DISTRICTS OF.

00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:22.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOLK. WE'VE HAD GOOD DEBATES ON

00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:24.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE PARTIAL TAX IN ITS VALIDITY

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:26.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK I WAS. IN THE MINORITY

00:55:27.023 --> 00:55:29.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
VIEW BUT WE STILL HAD FUN.

00:55:29.225 --> 00:55:29.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DEBATING.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I AM. I I AM JUST CURIOUS HOW

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:34.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OFTEN DOES A GROUP OF CITIZENS

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:36.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CIRCULATE A PETITION TO TRY AND

00:55:36.433 --> 00:55:39.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
RAISE A LOCAL TAX.

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:41.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I HAVE NOT OFTEN SEEN IT YEAH

00:55:41.237 --> 00:55:42.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BUT I'M NOW SEEING IT.

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:44.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO IT'S GONNA BE A NEW TOOL

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:46.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INSTEAD OF HAVING THE CITY

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:47.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COUNCIL PUT IT ON THE BALLOT.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
BUILD.

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:50.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE YOU COMMISSION A GROUP

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
YOU CAN CONTROL THE DAY.

00:55:51.614 --> 00:55:54.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO AND THEN YOU CAN GET FIFTY

00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:54.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
PERCENT THRESHOLD.

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M ON IT WE WE HAVEN'T I HAVE

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT ADVISING MY CLIENTS THAT THE

00:55:58.188 --> 00:55:59.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INITIATIVE PROCESS CHANGES THE

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:00.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
VOTE STANDARD BUT WHAT DOES

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CHANGE AND AND YOU KNOW IN

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:03.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POLITICS IT MATTERS WHAT DAY

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:05.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU'RE PUTTING THE BALLOT ON IT

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:05.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GIVES YOU CONTROL OVER THE

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:07.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ELECTION DATE. THERE WAS THE

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:08.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BALLOT BOX BUDGETING EVERYTHING

00:56:09.065 --> 00:56:10.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINK CITIES AND COUNTIES ALL

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY'VE GOT LEFT IS MAYBE TO

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:13.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
RAISE THE SALES TAX AND.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO YOU SEE THAT'S THAT THE CITY

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:15.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
COUNCIL OF THE BOARD OF

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:16.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUPERVISORS LEVELED. AND THE

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SALES TAX IS CAPPED AT TWO

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:18.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PERCENT.

00:56:18.942 --> 00:56:20.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON TOP

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:22.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THE STATE TAX. ON THAT TAXES

00:56:23.012 --> 00:56:25.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE A VESTED INDUSTRY OUT THERE

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:27.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WILL PROTECT THEIR TURF ON

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:28.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BUSINESS LICENSE TAXES.

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:30.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE COMPLEX A MEDICAL MARIJUANA

00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:31.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MARIJUANA TAXES OF THE FLAVOR OF

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:32.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THE MONTH.

00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:33.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISCOVER THAT THE INDUSTRY IS

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:37.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OVERTAXED. ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:37.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THEY'RE.

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:39.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PRODUCT PRICE FALLS TO THE

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

IF I MAY ONE IS THAT THE COURT

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DOES EVENTUALLY THAT IT

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMETIMES IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:39.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POSITION ON AN ISSUE FOR THE

GONNA MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS COURT. AND I THINK IT'S

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:39.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOING TO BE IN CHANGE UNTIL IT

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REACHES SOME STABILITY AND THAT

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STABILITY MAY BE A FEW YEARS

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:44.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AWAY SO THIS IS A VERY. FERTILE

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:45.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
TIME.

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:46.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
DECISIONS NOT BASED ON

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:23.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT TRUE BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REALLY NOT TRUE I'M AND SO I

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:27.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD JUST SAY THAT AND THEN

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:30.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SECONDLY.

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:31.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE COURT REACHED A NARROW

BUT IT COULD HAVE REACHED OUT TO

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:41.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT QUESTION IT IS A SUPREME

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

PRINCIPLE THAT OBVIOUSLY IS

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:18.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GROUNDS IN CALIFORNIA LAW THAT

AS MENTIONED AT THE START

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:19.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MEDIA

CHATTER ABOUT THE UPLAND

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:23.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

THREE REASONS. FROM THE OPINION

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:34.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ITSELF WHY I BELIEVE THAT VIEW

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:35.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
IS INCORRECT.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:37.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
FIRST.

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:38.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

FOR A GENERAL TAX.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:48.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ONE OF THE VIRTUES OF OUR

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:52.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SUPREME COURT IS JUDICIAL

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
