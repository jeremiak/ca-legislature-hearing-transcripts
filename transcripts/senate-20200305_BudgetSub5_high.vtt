AGE GROUP. AND THEN. SOME OF

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:05.811
THEM FOR THIS PROGRAM. SO IT'S

00:24:05.877 --> 00:24:08.246
GOING TO BE A- I GUESS OF

WILL BE ON THIS PROGRAM FROM

00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:13.919
THAT AGE GROUP. THEN ONCE YOU

THAT SUBGROUP OF THE WHOLE. SO

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.316
I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:21.987
VERY YOU KNOW. CUT ABOVE. YOU

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:25.290

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTORS AND THE

CONCERN IS THAT NOT INTENDED

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:10.981
BCP OTHER BUSY BEES MENTALLY

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:12.950
ENHANCED EXPERIENCE OF THE

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:15.119
INMATES TO ALLOW THEM TO DO

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:17.187
MORE PROGRAMMING AND THERE ARE

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:21.525
TIMES TO DO. THIS WORK. BAD

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:24.928
THERE IS. HI TO SPACE IN

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:26.797
COMPUTER LABS AND OVERALL JUST

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.832
DOESN'T ENHANCE THAT INMATES.

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:33.771
EDUCATION. I'M TO CARVE OUT A

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:35.539
COMMENT ON THAT WAS JUST FOR

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:36.273
ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES OF HOW

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.875
THIS MONEY COULD BE USED

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:39.543
ALTHOUGH A SKYROCKETING PRODUCT

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.545
EDUCATION NOT RECOMMENDED TO

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:46.884
INSTRUCTORS. OKAY QUESTION. ON

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.486
THAT- WHEN I WHEN I VISITED A

00:44:49.553 --> 00:44:52.956
LOT OF THE SOUL IS A- THE BIG

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:55.125
CLASSES AND I BE IN THE CLASS

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:57.561
AND ALSO IN. THE ALARM GO OFF

00:44:57.628 --> 00:45:00.531
AND- THE BILL WOULD HAVE TO GO

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:04.368
BACK TO THEIR CELLS AND- IT

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:05.569
HAPPENS FREQUENTLY RIGHT

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:09.907
INTERRUPTIONS. THIS THIS IS

00:45:09.973 --> 00:45:13.310
MORE FLEXIBLE TO AVOID THAT

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:15.446
COULD YOU YOU TALK ABOUT. IN

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:17.815
THE CLASSROOM KIND OF VERSES

00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:21.051
THIS APPROACH HELLO HOW YOU MIX

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:24.221
THE TWO TOGETHER. MAYBE A

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:26.023
MEASURE YEAH YEAH YEAH LIKE

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.658
BECAUSE IN TERMS OF OPERATING-

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:31.328
IN A FACILITY IN TRYING TO

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:34.031
EDUCATE THE INMATES AS I WAS IN

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:36.333
SOME WERE THERE. THERE IS A BUT

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.901
EVERY TIME AFTER TIME THERE IN

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:40.137
THE CLASSIC GOT INTERRUPTED.

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:41.638
THE SEVENTH SEAL IS SO WE'RE

00:45:41.705 --> 00:45:44.007
DOING IN THE DIVISION OF REAL

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:45.609
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WERE

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:46.777
DOING TWO THINGS TO HELP.

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.579
MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES

00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:50.514
ONE WE ARE TRACKING IN DETAIL

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.249
ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:54.218
DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS-

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:55.819
BASICALLY CLASSROOM ATTENDANCE

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:58.055
SO ANYTIME WHERE A STUDENT

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:59.656
WOULD HAVE TO EXIT THE

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:01.158
CLASSROOM FOR A PARTICULAR

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:02.860
PURPOSE. ALL TEXT REVIEW THAT

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:03.994
WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS TO SEE

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:05.295
WHAT WE CAN DO TO TRY AND

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:06.396
MITIGATE THOSE ISSUES THAT MAY

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:08.198
BE CAUSING THOSE DISTRACTIONS.

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:10.200
BUT TO GO TO THE LARGER POINT

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:11.568
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN THE-

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:13.904
AND- THE CONTEXT IN WHICH

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:15.172
YOU'RE LAYING THE QUESTION TO

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:17.307
SAY. IF SOMEBODY HAS A COMPUTER

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:19.243
OR THIN CLIENT LAPTOP CHECKED

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:20.777
OUT TO THEM THEY HAVE THE

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:21.778
ABILITY IF THEY'RE WALKING OUT

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:23.480
OF THAT CLASS OF GOING BACK TO

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:24.214
THEIR CELL. SIMPLY CLOSE THAT

00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:25.716
BOOKED AND WALK INTO THE

00:46:25.782 --> 00:46:28.886
CLASSROOM. WORKING OFFLINE AND

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:29.453
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.921
MAY BE WORKING ON A CLASS BACK

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:32.789
LATER COME BACK LATER AND- YOU

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:35.192
WENT. I'M THERE'S A LOT OF

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:36.593
OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS WITH

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.828
THESE MODELS THAT ALLOW. TO GET

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:40.998
A- TIME IT BEFORE. I'M PEOPLE

00:46:41.064 --> 00:46:43.167
WERE TO LEAVE OUR SET LIST ON

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:43.734
THAT TOPIC. WHEN YOU'RE OUT

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.437
THAT ROOM. WELL DO YOU. MANY

00:46:47.504 --> 00:46:50.107
TIMES THE CLASSES ARE. THE SOME.

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:51.008
THE BODY DOES WE DO YES

00:46:51.074 --> 00:46:53.644
CONTINUOUS. WILL THE MEASURE OF

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:54.511
THE POINT I'M MAKING IS. WITH

00:46:54.578 --> 00:47:00.017
THIS REDUCE THAT- DO. THIS

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:03.720
EDUCATE. LAST CLASSROOM

00:47:03.787 --> 00:47:06.757
TEACHERS I WOULD THINK IT MOST

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:07.891
PEOPLE THINK IT WOULD BE

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:09.593
SUPERIOR TO HAVE THAT

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.328
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TEACHER

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:14.498
ABOUT THAT SAME TIME. THE

00:47:14.565 --> 00:47:16.700
CLASSROOMS ERUPTED ALL THE TIME

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:17.701
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING EITHER

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:19.570
SO WE ARE NOT LOOKING TO

00:47:19.636 --> 00:47:22.105
SUPPLANT THE FACE TO FACE

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:22.673
INSTRUCTION WE DON'T WANT TO

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:23.240
FOCUS ON THE FACE TO FACE

00:47:23.307 --> 00:47:24.808
INSTRUCTION. BUT WITH THAT

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.543
ALLOWS THE TOOL TO BASICALLY

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.146
ALLOW THAT TO CONTINUE SO I

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.081
WILL STUDENTS WORK ON THIS SIDE

00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:33.183
THE CLASSROOM YES WOULD BE

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.420
AVOID GOING PAST USES LAPTOPS

00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:39.723
NOT THE GOAL GOAL IS TO REALLY

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.625
ENTER SO THAT THEY HAVE. A LOT

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:47.264
KNOWLEDGE. ONCE SOME OF.

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:48.732
FURTHER IF ON THIS SOME WAY

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:51.101
THANK YOU SURE I THINK YOU CHEN

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:53.604
AS PROGRESS TO OUR

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.605
REHABILITATION FOCUS WE'VE BEEN

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:57.207
OFFERING MORE MORE PROGRAMS AND

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:57.975
CLASSES IN YOUR RIGHT YOU KNOW

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:00.377
SORT OF HAVE A- LIMITED IN

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:01.678
TERMS OF SPACE. WHAT WE CAN DO

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:03.981
BUT ALSO BE. WE ARE TRYING TO

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:04.848
TECHNOLOGY IN AGAIN THAT WE'RE

00:48:04.915 --> 00:48:05.983
NOT TRYING TO SUPPLANT THE

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:07.951
EDUCATION CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE.

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:09.620
BUT WE'VE TRIED TO EXPAND

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:12.189
PROGRAMMING INTO. THIRD WATCH

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:13.557
AND OTHER AREAS OF THE WERE

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:16.226

FOR THE MAX AMOUNT OF TIME

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:19.363
POSSIBLE. YEAH I CAN PROVIDE

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:22.132
SOME A WRITTEN STATEMENT OKAY

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:24.201
THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:28.138
TESTIMONY ON THIS ISSUE PLEASE.

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:29.640
ONE ROTH DOESN'T REPRESENTING

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:31.475
SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND THE

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:33.110
TEACHERS. IN YOU KNOW WE SEE

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:34.945
THIS IS POSITIVE BUT WE YOU

00:48:35.012 --> 00:48:36.480
KNOW WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW THE

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:37.948
STUDENTS ARE MANY OF THEM HAVE

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:39.683
NOT HAD A SUCCESS. IN HIGH

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.753
SCHOOL WHAT IS SIXTY PERCENT-

00:48:42.819 --> 00:48:44.454
ARE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES OF BY

00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:46.923
REMEMBER. MANY OF OUR TEACHERS

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:48.592
TELL US ONE OF OUR MATH

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:49.760
TEACHERS FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:50.994
THINGS THAT THEY DO THEY PUT

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:53.363
NOT MEANT THREE. ON THE BOARD

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.198
