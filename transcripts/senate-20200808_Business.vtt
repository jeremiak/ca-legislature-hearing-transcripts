SPECIFICALLY ONLINE. CALIFORNIA

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.505

APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT REMAINS

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:32.345
IF A COVERT FOR PROFIT SCHOOL

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.313
IS PRETENDING TO BE A NONPROFIT

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.182
WITH INDEPENDENCE FROM ITS

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:38.284
PRIOR OWNER. WE HAVE HAD

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.886
EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:41.520
ASHFORD UNIVERSITY REGARDING

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.689

CAME TO US REQUESTING AN

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:47.059
APPEALS PROCESS SO WE ADDED AN

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:49.028
APPEALS PROCESS INTO THE BILL.

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.763
THIS YEAR ASHFORD REMAINS

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.598
OPPOSED NOW DUE TO A CLAUSE

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:53.466
REGARDING THE LENGTH OF THE

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:55.234
CONTRACT THAT THE NEW NONPROFIT

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.270
CAN HAVE WITH ITS PRIOR FOR

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:59.305
PROFIT OWNER. IN DIRECT

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.173

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.942
WE DOUBLE THE LENGTH TO THREE

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:05.244
YEARS BUT THAT DOES NOT APPEAR

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.046
TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:08.180
THIS CRITICAL PROVISION WOULD

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:10.149
ENSURE THAT A NONPROFIT BOARDS

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.984
MANAGEMENT CHOICES ARE BEING

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:14.220
MADE AS A FULLY INDEPENDENT

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.955
DECISION MAKER. NOT AFTER

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.556
ALREADY BEING COMMITTED LONG

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:19.926
TERM TO A CONTRACT WITH THEIR

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:22.328
PRIOR OWNERS. SO TO COME BACK

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.630
TO IT IF A TEN YEAR CONTRACT

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:25.798

FINANCIAL AID IN EXCHANGE 420%

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.139
OF YOUR REVENUE. IS A

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:35.341
REQUIREMENT OF THE SEPARATION

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.143
FROM THEM. ARE YOU REALLY

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:39.845
INDEPENDENT. IT IS ALSO

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.380
IMPORTANT NOTE THAT EIGHTY

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:42.848
SEVENTY DOES NOT PREVENT A

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.517
NONPROFIT INSTITUTION FROM

THEIR PRIOR FOR PROFIT OWNER AS

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.055
OFTEN AS IT WANTS TO. AND IT

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.423
DOES NOT LIMIT THE LENGTH OF

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:51.958
CONTRACTS WITH ANY OTHER

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:54.160

VERY CLEAR THAT UNDER MY BILL.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.533

THEY CAN DO THAT. THEY WILL

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.908

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:02.013

GO. IF THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:06.050
BEING TRICKED. INTO IN ROLE

00:33:06.117 --> 00:33:07.652
PLAYING BASED ON

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:09.954
MISREPRESENTATIONS AND FALSE

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:11.089

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:11.923
FEDERAL BEING MADE BY THAT

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:13.124
PRIVATE FOR PROFIT RIGHT

OBVIOUSLY UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:44.001
IS A GREAT PUBLIC INSTITUTION

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:45.369
AND OBVIOUSLY NO ONE HERE THE

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.204
COMMITTEE. WANTS TO SEE

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:16.300
SEEMS THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:17.868
COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WOULD

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:19.704

SINAI'S TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

01:09:04.106 --> 01:09:05.407
AND THAT IS A FORMER FACULTY

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:08.277
MEMBER. AT AT THE UNIVERSE

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.879
CALIFORNIA DAVIS CERTAINLY HAVE

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:13.816
FAMILIARITY WITH- THIS- THIS

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:16.318
EXEMPTION. I GUESS MY- SO I DO

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:17.586
HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS OF THE

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:18.888
BILL PERHAPS YOU CAN TY TO

01:09:18.954 --> 01:09:20.923
ADDRESS THIS FIRST OF ALL- I

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.758
WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- IT DOES

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.527
ESTABLISH A LEGAL DEFINITION OF

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:26.562
ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER- WHICH

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:28.631
ACTUALLY IS NOT SORT OF

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.366
CONSISTENT WITH COMMON USAGE-

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:32.167
SO IN. IN AT LEAST IN THE

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:33.636
MEDICAL FIELD- AND IN THE

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:36.639
ACADEMIC FIELD ACADEMIC MEDICAL

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:39.308
CENTER IS. USUALLY A HOSPITAL

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.175
THAT OF COURSE PERFORMS

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:41.410
TEACHING FUNCTION WHICH EITHER

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:43.012
SIDE DOES WAS AFFILIATED WITH A

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:43.979
MEDICAL SCHOOL WHICH I BELIEVE

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.981
CEDARS SINAI IS AS WELL BUT YET

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:46.682
THAT'S NOT PART OF THE

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:49.318
DEFINITION. AND I NOTE I DO

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:50.753
REALIZE THAT PART OF THE REASON

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.187
FOR THE BILL WAS IS BECAUSE THE

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:54.290
CURRENT PROCESS FOR THE-

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:56.425
EXEMPTION. WAS THAT THEY NEED

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:57.526
TO HAVE A MEDICAL SCHOOL

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:58.594
FACULTY APPOINTMENT WHICH TOOK

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:01.530
TIME RIGHT TO DO THAT AND

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:02.097
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THROUGH

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:04.633
UCLA- BUT I DO FEEL THAT IT'S

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.868
IMPORTANT THAT IF WE'RE GOING

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:06.969
TO CREATE A LEGAL DEFINITION OF

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.671
ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER IT

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:10.105
SHOULD ACTUALLY INCLUDE A

01:10:10.172 --> 01:10:11.407
FORMAL AFFILIATION AGREEMENT

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:14.243
WITH A MEDICAL SCHOOL- BECAUSE

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.145
I THINK THAT. THAT'S GOING TO

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:17.646
BE SOMETHING THAT'S A SERVICE

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:19.281
THAT THE PEOPLE YOU BRING OVER

01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:20.683
WHICH- UNDER DOES EXEMPTION

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:22.117
SHOULD BE PERFORMING A YEAH

01:10:22.184 --> 01:10:24.186
RESEARCH AND TEACHING FUNCTION-

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:26.055
THAT YOU'RE THIS ISN'T BECOMING

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:28.524
A LOOPHOLE TO BRING IN PEOPLE.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:31.160
TO A PRACTICE OUT OF WHO DON'T

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:32.194
NEED A LICENSE IN THE STATE OF

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:33.762
CALIFORNIA. AT ANY AYE

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:35.030
UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:36.832
DO COME IN THROUGH THIS

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:39.034
PARTICULAR- FUNCTION. ARE IN

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:40.502
PEOPLE WHO ARE PRE EMINENT IN

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:41.904
THEIR FIELD AROUND THE WORLD

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.106
AND- USUALLY OR OFTEN TIMES

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:45.407
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OR

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:47.476
THE INSTITUTION TEMPORARILY.

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:48.944
AND SO INSTEAD OF MAKING THEM

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.212
GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LICENSURE

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:52.715
PROCESS- DAY IF DEAL WITH

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:54.483
CREATED THIS SO THAT- THESE

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:56.251
WEEK WE COULD HAVE. THESE

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:57.820
EMINENT PEOPLE HERE IN THE U.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.355
S. AND BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW HAVE

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.890
HAVE THEM- DO THEIR RESEARCH

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.525
TUTOR TEACHING AND OFTENTIMES

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.461
IN ORDER MEETING POLITICAL

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:06.028
SCHOOLS WANT TO DO SOME VERY

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:10.599
LIMITED CLINICAL TIME WITHIN.

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:11.233
THE CONTEXT THAT INSTITUTIONS.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.134
THE SO THE OTHER THING SAID

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:13.936
MIKE. IS THE WAY THE BILL IS

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:16.905
FRAMED- WELL CERTAINLY CEDARS

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:18.841
SINAI THINKS FITS THE BILL AND-

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.542
AND I KNOW THAT YOU. THERE'S

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.311
EFFORTS IN THE DEFINITION BY

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:23.379
DECLARING THE SIZE AND SO

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:25.447
FORTH. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:27.383
THAT. YOU COULD HAVE A HOSPITAL

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.184
THAT CREATES A FACULTY PROGRAM

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.186
BUT IF IT'S NOT ACCREDITED AND

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:32.621
THAT'S THE AGAIN BY SELENA

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:33.756
MEDICAL SCHOOL MEDICAL SCHOOL

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.157
ITSELF HAS TO BE CREDITED BY

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:37.526
EITHER D. L. C. M. E. OR THE

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:39.361
OSTEOPATHIC. MEDICAL SCHOOLS

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:40.629
ASSOCIATION THAT ALSO IS A

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:42.731
LAYER OF PROTECTION TO ENSURE

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:43.899
THAT WE'RE BRINGING IN PEOPLE

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.701
WHO. THROUGH THAT ARE

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:47.636
RECOGNIZED BY INSTITUTIONS THAT

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:49.271
ACTUALLY HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:51.940
STANDARDS. SO I GUESS I'LL POSE

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:53.942
A QUESTION ABOUT. IT IN THE

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:55.110
DEFINITION WHICH WOULD BE

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:56.712
CONSISTENT COMMON USAGE THAT

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:58.714
THE INSTITUTION ALSO HAVE TO

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.015
HAVE A FORMAL FILIATION

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:01.950
AGREEMENT WITH A MEDICAL SCHOOL

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:04.486
WILL- SO HOPEFULLY THAT

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:05.554
CONSIDERATION. AND THEN THE

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:06.622
OTHER POINT I GUESS I WOULD

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:09.058
ALSO JUST MAKE IS THAT- YOU

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:11.126
KNOW I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.828
VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT. HAVING

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.263
PEOPLE ARE PERFORMING CLINICAL

01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:16.065
DUTIES. THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:18.067
LICENSE BECAUSE IN SOME SENSES-

01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:20.402
IF FOR SOME REASON THAT PERSON

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.371
YOU KNOW- AND AGAIN THESE ARE

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:23.806
PEOPLE. THAT THE ORIGINAL

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.007
PURPOSE OF THIS OF PEOPLE OR

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:26.141
EMINENT ALTHOUGH THE YOU TALK

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:27.443
ABOUT ALSO BEING IN JUNIOR

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.977
PROMISING JUNIOR PEOPLE. THAT

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:31.814
IF THEY DO. HAVE A PROBLEM. YOU

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.648
CAN'T TAKE THE LICENSE AWAY

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:35.317
EXAMPLE LICENSE SO- SO THAT'S

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:36.585
SO THE DECISION DISCIPLINARY

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:38.554
MECHANISMS ARE NOT ENFORCING IN

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.456
PLACE AND- I WOULD MAKE NOTE

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:41.590
THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD OF

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:43.826
CALIFORNIA AS OPPOSED. TO THIS

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:46.729
PARTICULAR BILL SO- I EIGHT ONE

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.899
IS PRETTY NARROWLY FOCUSED AND

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:52.000
CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:54.470
INTENT OF THESE. EXEMPTIONS

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.004

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:04.793
CERTAINLY CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP

HOSPITAL THAT WAS INDEPENDENT

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:13.969

WITH THE MEDICAL SCHOOL AND SO-

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:20.976
SO I GUESS- THAT. IS ON JUST- I

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:23.011

THAT- THAT THAT'S THAT THIS

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:35.886
BILL IS GOING TO REQUIRE OR IS

02:31:35.953 --> 02:31:37.388
IT SIMPLY NEEDS THREE YEARS OF

02:32:17.661 --> 02:32:18.696
I WOULD MAKE NOTES THAT DAY

02:32:18.762 --> 02:32:21.031
HERE. IN THIS COMMITTEE- WHEN

02:32:21.098 --> 02:32:22.600

EDUCATION AND SO FORTH AND WE

02:32:32.209 --> 02:32:33.611
FOUND SOME DEFICIENCIES IN THAT

02:32:33.677 --> 02:32:35.813
REGARD TERMS OF. AND TERMS OF

RESEARCH OCCASIONS SELVES.

02:32:46.991 --> 02:32:48.926
AGAIN HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT TOO

02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:50.461
MANY QUESTIONS BUT- THERE

02:32:50.528 --> 02:32:52.196
WHETHER IT'S IN THE APPRECIATE-

02:32:52.263 --> 02:32:53.964
YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON THIS

02:32:54.031 --> 02:32:55.766

TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION QUITE

02:33:04.875 --> 02:33:06.110
FRANKLY SO. GUARDS TO SUPPLY

02:33:06.176 --> 02:33:09.280
THAT PIECE I AM NOT AWARE OF A

02:33:09.346 --> 02:33:10.481
STUDY THAT'S ABOUT THE- SUPPLY

02:33:10.548 --> 02:33:12.016
OF MPS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:14.118
THIS. THAT IN STATES THAT HAVE

02:33:14.184 --> 02:33:15.619
A MORE LENIENT SCOPE OF

02:33:15.686 --> 02:33:18.122
PRACTICE THERE ARE A HIGHER

02:33:18.188 --> 02:33:18.722
NUMBER OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS

02:33:18.789 --> 02:33:20.257
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING HIS IN

02:33:20.324 --> 02:33:21.492
STATES WHERE IT IS MORE

02:33:21.559 --> 02:33:22.726
RESTRICTIVE. THOSE ARE THE

02:33:22.793 --> 02:33:24.595
PRACTITIONERS WHO WISH TO

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:27.331
RESPOND WISH TO PURSUE. AN

02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:29.633
INDEPENDENT PRACTICE OR WITH

02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:30.501
SUPERVISION TEND TO GO TO

02:33:30.568 --> 02:33:32.703
STATES SO THE NO PER CAPITA

02:33:32.770 --> 02:33:35.239
CALIFORNIA. IS PROBABLY LOWER

02:33:35.306 --> 02:33:36.440
THAN IT IS IN MANY OTHER

02:33:36.507 --> 02:33:39.877
STATES. WITH REGARDS TO DO A

02:33:39.944 --> 02:33:43.547
TRADE ISSUE. IN THE PRESS THIS

02:33:43.614 --> 02:33:51.889
REMEMBER. THAT AT. AND I DO

02:33:51.956 --> 02:33:53.390

ABLE TO. GO TO THE NEXT THREE

02:33:55.326 --> 02:33:56.293
YEAR TREND PERIOD AND IS DOES.

02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:57.661
TO FOCUS ON ONE OF FIVE A AND

02:33:57.728 --> 02:33:58.929
THAT. IT IS A FOR. THESE PRETTY

02:33:58.996 --> 02:34:01.031
AREAS WHERE THE- AND ONCE YOU

02:34:01.098 --> 02:34:02.766
COMPLETE THAT AND THAT THAT

02:34:02.833 --> 02:34:04.802
TRAINING IN THOSE FIVE AREAS.

02:34:04.868 --> 02:34:05.836
THAN THE THAN THE BILL

02:34:05.903 --> 02:34:07.237
SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT YOU ARE

02:34:07.304 --> 02:34:09.106
NOT. ALLOWED TO PRACTICE

02:34:09.173 --> 02:34:10.341
OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF WHERE YOUR

02:34:10.407 --> 02:34:12.910
TRAINING AS- AS FAR AS SKILLS

02:34:12.977 --> 02:34:14.311
OVER TIME YOU KNOW I'M A

02:34:14.378 --> 02:34:15.479
PRACTICING DENTIST I STILL

02:34:15.546 --> 02:34:17.414
MAINTAIN MY LICENSE. REQUIRED

02:34:17.481 --> 02:34:19.617
TO DO CONTINUING EDUCATION- TO

02:34:19.683 --> 02:34:21.352
GO ACTUALLY ASK SOMEBODY TO GO

02:34:21.418 --> 02:34:23.087
BACK AND DO A RE CERTIFICATION-

02:34:23.153 --> 02:34:24.488
UNLESS YOU'RE A SPECIALIST THAT

02:34:24.555 --> 02:34:26.123
I'M AWARE OF MAYBE ADVANCED.

02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:27.391
ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT THAT KIND

02:34:27.458 --> 02:34:30.060
OF THING- I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT

02:34:30.127 --> 02:34:31.362
SO I THINK THAT ADDING. A

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:32.963
REQUIREMENT THAT SOMEBODY GO

02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:34.064
BACK IN RECERTIFY WOULD BE

02:34:34.131 --> 02:34:38.002
ONEROUS AND NOT NOT

02:34:38.068 --> 02:34:38.502

PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO THEIR

CONTINUING EDUCATION SO. SO YOU

02:34:49.046 --> 02:34:51.448

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:08.032
WOULD MAKE NOTED THAT-

02:35:08.098 --> 02:35:09.133
CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA WITH THE

02:35:09.199 --> 02:35:10.100
BIGGEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY WE

02:35:10.167 --> 02:35:11.435
HAD TO HAVE THE MOST NUMBER OF

02:35:11.502 --> 02:35:14.805
A NURSE PRACTITIONERS- THE- I

02:35:14.872 --> 02:35:17.074
THINK WHEN YOU- WHEN I WAS IN

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:19.510
THE OPENING- SOME NUMBER OF

02:35:19.576 --> 02:35:21.578
RACY FAIL POINTED OUT THAT HE

02:35:21.645 --> 02:35:23.514
AND ALSO I ACTUALLY SERVED. ON

02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:25.916
THE WORKFORCE COMMISSION I

02:35:25.983 --> 02:35:28.819
ESTIMATE THAT- I ENDED UP

02:35:28.886 --> 02:35:29.753
RESIGNING FROM THE COMMISSION

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:31.455
BECAUSE I FELT THAT THE WORK OF

02:35:31.522 --> 02:35:35.125
THE COMMISSION WAS WAS WAS NOT.

02:35:35.192 --> 02:35:36.960
IN CONCERT WITH MY BACKGROUND

02:35:37.027 --> 02:35:39.396
IS A WORKFORCE RESEARCHER AND-

02:35:39.463 --> 02:35:40.531
SO I HAD DID HAVE CONCERNS

02:35:40.597 --> 02:35:42.666
ABOUT THE FINAL REPORT AND NOT

02:35:42.733 --> 02:35:43.500
FEEL LIKE I COULD TOUCH MY NAME

02:35:43.567 --> 02:35:45.769
TO IT- BUT I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE

02:35:45.836 --> 02:35:48.572
FIRST OF ALL- IN TERMS OF. YOU

02:35:48.639 --> 02:35:49.807
KNOW THE ONE THE MAIN REASONS

02:35:49.873 --> 02:35:52.443
BUT FOR THIS BILL IS REGARDING-

02:35:52.509 --> 02:35:54.278
YOU KNOW WORKFORCE UNCERTAIN WE

02:35:54.344 --> 02:35:57.047
HAVE CHALLENGES WITH. WORKFORCE

02:35:57.114 --> 02:35:59.650
IN. RURAL COMMUNITIES AND DOES

02:35:59.717 --> 02:36:01.051
INCLUDING THE ONES REPRESENTED

02:36:01.118 --> 02:36:06.090
BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- MANY OF

02:36:06.156 --> 02:36:06.857
US YOU MAY REPRESENT. A REAL

02:36:06.924 --> 02:36:07.691
COMMUNITIES AS WELL SO ENDS

02:36:07.758 --> 02:36:10.027
COMMUNITY. I WOULD MAKE NOTE

02:36:10.094 --> 02:36:13.030
THAT- YELLED THAT STATES THAT

02:36:13.097 --> 02:36:16.400
HAVE. OPENED UP THEIR THEIR

02:36:16.467 --> 02:36:17.768
LAWS THE STILL HAVE WORKFORCE

02:36:17.835 --> 02:36:19.770
ISSUES ALL RIGHT I MEAN IT'S A

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:20.971
ROOF FOR COURSE RESEARCHER I

02:36:21.038 --> 02:36:22.139
DON'T SEE THOSE DIDN'T SEE

02:36:22.206 --> 02:36:24.074
THOSE GO AWAY AFTER THEY

02:36:24.141 --> 02:36:25.175
CHANGED OUR NURSE PRACTITIONERS

02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:26.643
ALSO. MAIL BECAUSE THE NURSE

02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:28.378
PRACTITIONERS A RARE DOING WORK

02:36:28.445 --> 02:36:30.013
THERE THEY'RE DOING THE WORK-

02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:32.282
HE MATCH THE VA THE VA STILL

02:36:32.349 --> 02:36:33.817
HAS SHORTAGES AND USE YOU SEE

02:36:33.884 --> 02:36:35.519
THE AGE THAT IS MINISTRATION

02:36:35.586 --> 02:36:37.287
STILL WORKING TO TRY TO FIGURE

02:36:37.354 --> 02:36:38.255
OUT HOW TO SEE. ALL THE

02:36:38.322 --> 02:36:40.124
PATIENTS. THAT WE NEED TO SEE

02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:42.559
SO- I THINK AS AN ANSWER TO

02:36:42.626 --> 02:36:44.495
WORK FORCE- I THINK THEY COULD

02:36:44.561 --> 02:36:45.662
ACTUALLY THE EVIDENCE IS KIND

02:36:45.729 --> 02:36:47.364
OF QUESTIONABLE ON THAT IS

02:36:47.431 --> 02:36:51.034
SOMEONE WHO'S HAS. A BACKGROUND

02:36:51.101 --> 02:36:51.702
IN LOOKING AT THAT. IT THAT

02:36:51.769 --> 02:36:55.239
THERE IS. THE TRAIN. YOU KNOW I.

02:36:55.305 --> 02:36:56.473
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR

02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:57.875
THAT THERE'S THIS IS NO

02:36:57.941 --> 02:36:59.810
COMPARISON TO WHAT PHYSICIANS.

02:36:59.877 --> 02:37:00.978
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND

02:37:01.044 --> 02:37:02.513
IN PRACTICE GO THROUGH SO WHEN

02:37:02.579 --> 02:37:03.981

CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN'T JUST GO

02:37:08.919 --> 02:37:10.120
OUT AND HANG A SHINGLE. THE

02:37:10.187 --> 02:37:11.455
BOARD OF MEDICINE WILL NOT GIVE

OF THE CREDITING BODY. THIS

02:37:26.403 --> 02:37:28.372

PLAN PRACTICE EVEN WITHIN AND

02:37:31.708 --> 02:37:33.544
D. WITHOUT A VERY STRUCTURED

02:37:33.610 --> 02:37:35.946
RIGOROUS- PROGRAM. THAT HAS TO

02:37:36.013 --> 02:37:39.716
BE. REVIEWED AND EVALUATED AND-

02:37:39.783 --> 02:37:41.018
ACTUALLY THE SUPERVISOR HAS TO

02:37:41.084 --> 02:37:43.520
SIGN OFF. THAT THE PERSON IS

02:37:43.587 --> 02:37:45.189
PREPARED FOR THE PARA PRACTICE.

02:37:45.255 --> 02:37:47.224
AND EVEN DESPITE THAT. YOU THEN

02:37:47.291 --> 02:37:48.525
ALSO HAVE TO TAKE ADDITIONAL

02:37:48.592 --> 02:37:50.127
EXAMINATIONS TO DEMONSTRATE

02:37:50.194 --> 02:37:52.095
THAT TO YOU ARE COMPETENT IN

02:38:06.009 --> 02:38:07.277
THOUGH ON THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:38:07.344 --> 02:38:09.713
THAT AND FULL TIME PRACTICE. I

02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:11.381
ACTUALLY HAVE TO RECERTIFY.

02:38:11.448 --> 02:38:14.284
EVERY TEN YEARS TO PROVE THAT I

02:38:14.351 --> 02:38:17.087
AM KEEPING UP RIGHT AND- SO

02:38:17.154 --> 02:38:18.989
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:38:19.056 --> 02:38:20.791
PHYSICIANS ALL HAVE TO DO. THAT

02:38:20.858 --> 02:38:22.659
IS NOTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE

02:38:22.726 --> 02:38:25.028
ARE YOU KNOW ABLE TO CONTINUE

02:38:25.095 --> 02:38:26.763
TO AND IF YOU DON'T-

02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:28.298
ESSENTIALLY IT'S VERY HARD TO

02:38:28.365 --> 02:38:30.033
GET ANY CREDENTIALS TO CONTINUE

02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:31.869
TO PRACTICE ANYWHERE SO THAT IS

02:38:31.935 --> 02:38:34.071
SOMETHING THAT IS THAT WHAT

02:38:34.137 --> 02:38:36.940
PHYSICIANS GO THROUGH- SO AND

02:38:37.007 --> 02:38:39.209
IF YOU DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE G.

02:38:39.276 --> 02:38:40.777
IT'S VERY CHALLENGING FOR YOU

02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:43.180
TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE. NOW

02:38:43.247 --> 02:38:44.648
THAT I IN MY CAREER OF ALSO

02:38:44.715 --> 02:38:45.849
WORKED THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS

02:38:45.916 --> 02:38:46.617
I THINK AS MANY OF THE

02:38:46.683 --> 02:38:48.485
WITNESSES WHO FIVE TESTIFIED IN

02:38:48.552 --> 02:38:49.720
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND

02:38:49.786 --> 02:38:51.054
CERTAINLY THEY HAVE THEIR VERY

02:38:51.121 --> 02:38:54.258
IMPORTANT ROLE WE NEED NURSE

02:38:54.324 --> 02:38:54.892
PRACTITIONERS HERE IN THE STATE

02:38:54.958 --> 02:38:56.393
OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY DO VERY

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:58.395
IMPORTANT WORK. AND FACT IN

02:38:58.462 --> 02:39:00.264
MANY WAYS. THERE AREN'T VERY

02:39:00.330 --> 02:39:01.765
MANY THINGS THAT I THINK THIS

02:39:01.832 --> 02:39:03.400
BILL WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT

02:39:03.467 --> 02:39:04.935
THEY CAN'T ALREADY DO ALREADY.

02:39:05.002 --> 02:39:06.270
JUST HAPPENS THAT THEY HAVE TO

02:39:06.336 --> 02:39:08.672
BE WORKING IN TEAMS. WHICH IS

02:39:08.739 --> 02:39:10.407
SOMETHING THAT I THINK. MOST OF

02:39:10.474 --> 02:39:11.341
US WHO ARE LOOKING AT HEALTH

02:39:11.408 --> 02:39:12.976
POLICY SAY WE NEED MORE TEAM

02:39:13.043 --> 02:39:15.112
BASED CARE. WE DON'T NEED MORE

02:39:15.178 --> 02:39:16.280
FRAGMENTATION OF CARE WE NEED

02:39:16.346 --> 02:39:18.282
MORE TEAM BASED CARE. AND SO

02:39:18.348 --> 02:39:19.483
CREATING MORE INDEPENDENT

02:39:19.549 --> 02:39:20.984
PRACTITIONERS DOESN'T NESTLE

02:39:21.051 --> 02:39:22.886
FOSTERED THE CONTINUATION OF

02:39:22.953 --> 02:39:25.522
TEAMS. AND THAT IS WHEN WE

02:39:25.589 --> 02:39:27.024
THINK ABOUT QUALITY OF CARE AND

02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:27.624
MOVING FORWARD THAT IS

02:39:27.691 --> 02:39:30.427
SOMETHING THAT. WE NEED TO DO

02:39:30.494 --> 02:39:32.496
FOR NOW I THINK JUST ONE FINAL

02:39:32.562 --> 02:39:35.332
POINT- BECAUSE WE OFTEN TALK

02:39:35.399 --> 02:39:36.466
ABOUT PRIMARY CARE THIS BILL IS

02:39:36.533 --> 02:39:37.634
NOT LIMITED TO NURSE

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:38.602
PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE THE

02:39:38.669 --> 02:39:39.870
PRIVATE CARE NURSE PRACTITIONER

02:39:39.937 --> 02:39:41.204
SPECIALIZES WHILE I WORKED WITH

02:39:41.271 --> 02:39:42.639
NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO. ARE

02:39:42.706 --> 02:39:43.874
SPECIALISTS AND WE NEED THEM IN

02:39:43.941 --> 02:39:46.009
THE SPECIALTIES AS WELL. AND

02:39:46.076 --> 02:39:46.610
THEY WORK IN SUPERVISION WITH

02:39:46.677 --> 02:39:48.312
THE- WITH THE SPECIALTY

02:39:48.378 --> 02:39:51.114
PHYSICIANS AND- SO I DO THINK

02:39:51.181 --> 02:39:52.582
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM THIS TO

02:39:52.649 --> 02:39:53.917
THIS. AND OUT ALSO FINALLY

02:39:53.984 --> 02:39:55.619
POINT OUT THAT WE HEARD YOU

02:39:55.686 --> 02:39:56.486
KNOW THE MEDICAL BOARD OF

02:39:56.553 --> 02:39:57.788
CALIFORNIA HAS CONCERNS IT IS

02:39:57.854 --> 02:39:59.022
OPPOSITION. WE JUST HEARD

02:39:59.089 --> 02:40:00.357
TESTIMONY FROM THE BOARD OF

02:40:00.424 --> 02:40:02.426
REGISTERED NURSING ABOUT THEIR

02:40:02.492 --> 02:40:03.694
CONCERNS AS WELL AND THERE HAVE

02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:06.330
BEEN OPPOSED ISN'T. THAT UNLESS

02:40:06.396 --> 02:40:07.931
AMENDED POSITION FROM THEIR

02:40:07.998 --> 02:40:09.366
TESTIMONY TODAY SO I HAD IT

02:40:09.433 --> 02:40:11.935
WITH ALL THOSE CONCERNS IT'S IN.

02:40:12.002 --> 02:40:15.238
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO. TO SUPPORT

02:40:15.305 --> 02:40:16.907
THIS BILL AT THIS TIME THANK

COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATE

02:40:24.247 --> 02:40:27.084
ARCHULETA MISSED. WHEN THE

02:40:27.150 --> 02:40:29.119
AUTHOR PRESENTED THE BILL SAID

02:40:29.186 --> 02:40:32.289
I ACCEPT SOME- AMENDMENTS YOU

STATEMENT- DID YOU GET RECEIVE

02:40:35.993 --> 02:40:37.461
A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT.

02:40:37.527 --> 02:40:39.029
WERE PRESENTED AND THEY'VE COME

02:40:39.096 --> 02:40:40.931
TOGETHER. OR THEY ARE STILL

02:40:40.998 --> 02:40:42.065
BEING LOOKED AT WHAT'S THE

02:40:42.132 --> 02:40:43.667
STATUS OF IT THANK YOU FOR THE

02:40:43.734 --> 02:40:44.701
QUESTION CENTER ARCH ALETTA IN

02:40:44.768 --> 02:40:47.070
THE ANALYSIS. TWO THINGS HAVE

02:40:47.137 --> 02:40:47.637
HAPPENED SINCE THE BILL WAS

02:40:47.704 --> 02:40:49.639
INITIALLY. REFERRED TO A

02:40:49.706 --> 02:40:51.475
COMMITTEE FIRST THE BILL WAS-

02:40:51.541 --> 02:40:53.343
AUTHORS AMENDMENTS WERE.

02:40:53.410 --> 02:40:54.845
INSERTED INTO THE BILL. AND

02:40:54.911 --> 02:40:56.780
SECONDLY- IN THE COMMITTEE

02:40:56.847 --> 02:40:58.048
ANALYSIS OR VARIETY OF

02:40:58.115 --> 02:40:59.750
AMENDMENTS- SUGGESTED IN IS

02:40:59.816 --> 02:41:01.918
TESTIMONY. INDICATED THAT HE

02:41:01.985 --> 02:41:05.422
WOULD ACCEPT ALL OF THEM THEY

02:41:05.489 --> 02:41:06.823
BEGIN ON PAGE TWENTY. HI NUMBER

02:41:06.890 --> 02:41:07.924
NINE. AND THERE'S THREE OF THEM

02:41:07.991 --> 02:41:11.361
THAT ARE SO INDICATED THERE.

02:41:11.428 --> 02:41:13.030
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD LIKE TO

02:41:13.096 --> 02:41:14.898
ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. NO IT'S

02:41:14.965 --> 02:41:16.833
JUST THAT- I WOULD LOOK AT THIS

02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:18.835
AND SORT OF THREE BUCKETS AS

02:41:18.902 --> 02:41:20.837
FAR AS YOU KNOW THE MANY THINGS

02:41:20.904 --> 02:41:23.273
THAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO AUG-

02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:25.008
AUGUST SIXTH SO AMENDMENTS THAT

02:41:25.075 --> 02:41:26.643
HAPPENED ON AUGUST SIXTH AND

02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:27.911
THEN THE AMENDMENTS YOU'RE

02:41:27.978 --> 02:41:29.179
TALKING ABOUT NOW THAT WE HAVE

02:41:29.246 --> 02:41:30.414
TALKED ABOUT WHICH ARE REALLY

02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:31.748
MINOR AND TECHNICAL IN NATURE

02:41:31.815 --> 02:41:33.316
SO THERE REALLY THERE'S REALLY

02:41:33.383 --> 02:41:35.385
NOTHING SIGNIFICANT THERE-

02:41:35.452 --> 02:41:36.620
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY

02:41:36.686 --> 02:41:39.089
CONTINUE TO CLARIFY AND

02:41:39.156 --> 02:41:42.192
STRENGTHEN THIS BILL. AND ALSO

02:41:42.259 --> 02:41:45.462
THE FURTHER SAID ARCHULETA FELL

02:41:45.529 --> 02:41:46.096
THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR

02:41:46.163 --> 02:41:49.299
CENTERS. WELL CENTER LATENCIES.

02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:51.835
OF THE BILL IS APPROPRIATE

02:41:51.902 --> 02:41:54.004
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A CENTER

02:41:54.071 --> 02:41:56.273
WOULD LEVY HELLO SORRY CENTER

02:41:56.339 --> 02:41:58.942
CHIANG YOUR QUESTION. THE

02:41:59.009 --> 02:42:03.847
PLEASE. SO I JUST WANT TO. IT'S

02:42:03.914 --> 02:42:05.749
VERY LOUD- I JUST WANT TO SAY

02:42:05.816 --> 02:42:09.753
THAT- IT THIS PARTICULAR.

02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:11.855
MEASURE HAS BEEN A REALLY

02:42:11.922 --> 02:42:15.792
TOUGH- MEASURE FOR ME. BECAUSE

02:42:15.859 --> 02:42:16.893
SCOPE OF PRACTICE BILLS

02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:17.961
INHERENTLY CREATE A CONFLICT

02:42:18.028 --> 02:42:19.529
BETWEEN TWO CRITICAL GOALS

02:42:19.596 --> 02:42:21.731
PATIENT SAFETY NEXUS CARE AND

02:42:21.798 --> 02:42:23.100
YOU KNOW I COME FROM A FAMILY

02:42:23.166 --> 02:42:25.368
OF DENTISTS AND DOCTORS. SO I'M

02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:28.805
I'M WHERE THIS- I WANTED TO

02:42:28.872 --> 02:42:30.006
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I WOULD HAVE

02:42:30.073 --> 02:42:31.274
BEEN OPPOSED TO SIMILAR

02:42:31.341 --> 02:42:32.676
MEASURES IN THE PAST FOR

02:42:32.742 --> 02:42:34.845
EXAMPLE SB THREE TWENTY THREE.

02:42:34.911 --> 02:42:35.412
YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS IN THE

02:42:35.479 --> 02:42:38.315
ASSEMBLY APPIAN P. AND IT

02:42:38.381 --> 02:42:39.883
FAILED AND BECAUSE IT WAS JUST

02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:41.084
SO IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT

02:42:41.151 --> 02:42:45.388
SACRIFICE. PATIENT SAFETY. ALSO

02:42:45.455 --> 02:42:46.156
IN THIS BILL THERE WERE NUMBER

02:42:46.223 --> 02:42:47.457
CONCERNS RAISED BY DOCTORS AND

02:42:47.524 --> 02:42:48.792
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THAT

02:42:48.859 --> 02:42:50.494
WEREN'T ADDRESSED IN THE BILL.

02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:51.761
BUT I GOTTA SAY THAT TIMES ARE

02:42:51.828 --> 02:42:54.397
DIFFERENT. AND YOU KNOW MAYBE

02:42:54.464 --> 02:42:56.600
MY DECISION WOULD BE DIFFERENT

02:42:56.666 --> 02:42:58.435
IF YOU KNOW WE WERE IN A GLOBAL

02:42:58.502 --> 02:43:02.205
PANDEMIC. BUT AS WE NAVIGATE

02:43:02.272 --> 02:43:04.341
THIS THIS PANDEMIC I BELIEVE WE

02:43:04.407 --> 02:43:07.611
NEED TO GIVE RENEWED ATTENTION.

02:43:07.677 --> 02:43:08.578
TO THESE CREATIVE WAYS TO

02:43:08.645 --> 02:43:10.747
CREATE MORE ACCESS AND

02:43:10.814 --> 02:43:11.381
AFFORDABILITY IN THE HEALTHCARE

02:43:11.448 --> 02:43:13.517
SYSTEM. SO UNDER THE LEADERSHIP

02:43:13.583 --> 02:43:15.785
OF THE CHAIR ON HERE IS A

02:43:15.852 --> 02:43:19.122
PROPOSAL THAT OUTLINES A PRETTY

02:43:19.189 --> 02:43:20.991
WELL CRAFTED PROCESS TO PROTECT

02:43:21.057 --> 02:43:23.827
PATIENTS AND EXPAND ACCESS TO

02:43:23.894 --> 02:43:25.962
CARE. AND I CARE I REALLY

02:43:26.029 --> 02:43:27.330
WANTED TO PUT AN EMPHASIS ON

02:43:27.397 --> 02:43:28.765
THE GUARD RAILS YOU KNOW WE'VE

02:43:28.832 --> 02:43:29.799
BEEN TALKING ABOUT CORD REELS

02:43:29.866 --> 02:43:31.868
FOR MANY WEEKS NOW AND WANTED

02:43:31.935 --> 02:43:35.438
TO HIGHLIGHT. YOU KNOW PATIENT

02:43:35.505 --> 02:43:37.541
PROTECTIONS. FIRST ROSE TO BE

02:43:37.607 --> 02:43:39.543
AMENDED THIS BILL ENSURES

02:43:39.609 --> 02:43:41.111
QUALITY TRAINING FOR NURSE

02:43:41.178 --> 02:43:42.212
PRACTITIONERS INCLUDING

02:43:42.279 --> 02:43:43.947
CERTIFICATION ONLY FROM

02:43:44.014 --> 02:43:46.349
ACCREDITED BOARDS. EXTENSIVE

02:43:46.416 --> 02:43:48.018
TRAINING REQUIRES AN PIEC HAVE

02:43:48.084 --> 02:43:49.019
COMPLETED THREE YEARS OF

02:43:49.085 --> 02:43:50.720
SUPERVISED PRACTICE AND AN

02:43:50.787 --> 02:43:51.655
ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS OF

02:43:51.721 --> 02:43:52.822
SUPERVISED TRANSITION TO

02:43:52.889 --> 02:43:55.125
PRACTICE BEFORE. OF PRACTICING

02:43:55.192 --> 02:43:56.459
INDEPENDENTLY UNDER THE

02:43:56.526 --> 02:44:00.030
SUPERVISION OF PHYSICIANS AND

02:44:00.096 --> 02:44:00.597
THAT SIX YEARS OF REAL LIFE

02:44:00.664 --> 02:44:03.200
TRAINING. IT REQUIRES MPS TO

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:05.235
COMMUNICATE WITH PATIENTS ABOUT

02:44:05.302 --> 02:44:05.735
WHAT THEIR ROLE IN THE

02:44:05.802 --> 02:44:07.704
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS THAT AND

02:44:07.771 --> 02:44:09.873
TO MENTION THAT THEY ARE NOT A

02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:11.474
PHYSICIAN THEY'RE NOT A DOCTOR.

02:44:11.541 --> 02:44:13.877
IT REQUIRES MPS TO CREATE A

02:44:13.944 --> 02:44:16.046
PLAN THAT SPECIFIES WHEN WHERE

02:44:16.112 --> 02:44:17.614
WHY AND HOW THEY WILL REFER

02:44:17.681 --> 02:44:19.849
CASES. TO A PHYSICIAN WHEN

02:44:19.916 --> 02:44:21.151
THEY'RE BEYOND THEIR LEVEL

02:44:21.218 --> 02:44:23.353
EDUCATION OR TRAINING. AND IT

02:44:23.420 --> 02:44:25.322
ESTABLISHES CLEAR DISCIPLINARY

02:44:25.388 --> 02:44:27.357
PROCEDURES. I BELIEVE THAT

02:44:27.424 --> 02:44:28.525
THESE ARE EXTENSIVE AND

02:44:28.592 --> 02:44:29.826
COMPREHENSIVE CHANGES TO

02:44:29.893 --> 02:44:32.929
PROTECT PATIENTS AND GIVE US AN

02:44:32.996 --> 02:44:35.665
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT TOOL EXPAND

02:44:35.732 --> 02:44:38.902
CARE TO THOSE MOST IN NEED. I

02:44:38.969 --> 02:44:41.471
WANT TO SAY THAT I'M A I REALLY

02:44:41.538 --> 02:44:43.573
DO APPRECIATE THE WORK AND

02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:45.141
FLEXIBILITY OF THE AUTHOR. AND

02:44:45.208 --> 02:44:46.509
AGAIN THE CURRENT PANDEMIC IS

02:44:46.576 --> 02:44:47.944
CHANGING HOW WE LOOK AT THESE

02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:50.080
ISSUES AND IT IS IMPERATIVE

02:44:50.146 --> 02:44:52.015
THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. I KNOW

02:44:52.082 --> 02:44:52.983
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

TRYING TO SORT OF GET MY ARMS

03:49:48.474 --> 03:49:49.876

THINGS FROM THE OPPOSITION SO

03:49:53.679 --> 03:49:55.882
FAR SO NUMBER ONE I GUESS THE

03:49:55.948 --> 03:49:59.785
QUESTION IS THAT. CAN YOU USE

03:49:59.852 --> 03:50:01.621
THE TECHNOLOGY TODAY ALREADY

03:50:01.687 --> 03:50:03.322
RIGHT WOULD- IN TERMS OF

03:50:03.389 --> 03:50:06.692
SPECIFICITY. NUMBER TWO I GUESS

03:50:06.759 --> 03:50:08.327
THE BILL ACTUALLY JUST BECAUSE

03:50:08.394 --> 03:50:09.228
FOR THE TASK FORCE WHICH YOU

03:50:09.295 --> 03:50:09.762
MENTIONED YOU'RE HAVING

03:50:09.829 --> 03:50:11.097
CONVERSATIONS OKAY NOW BE

03:50:11.164 --> 03:50:14.534
AMENDED TO GEO THAT SEEMS TO

03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:15.101
MAKE MORE SENSE THAN MEDICAL

03:50:15.168 --> 03:50:15.701
BOARD. BUT THEN I GUESS THE

03:50:15.768 --> 03:50:17.069
OTHER THING IS THE EXAMPLE THAT

03:50:17.136 --> 03:50:19.038
WAS GIVEN ABOUT USING THIS

03:50:19.105 --> 03:50:20.673
TECHNOLOGY WAS FOR EXAMPLE-

03:50:20.740 --> 03:50:23.576
TESTING IN THE WORKPLACE AND-

03:50:23.643 --> 03:50:25.011
WHERE YOU KNOW THEN THEY COULD

03:50:25.077 --> 03:50:27.813
SEND THE RESULTS TO PEOPLE. AND

03:50:27.880 --> 03:50:29.849
THEN IF THE- PLAYER WANTS TO BE

03:50:29.916 --> 03:50:31.250
SURE WHEN GOT TESTED AND THEY

03:50:31.317 --> 03:50:32.985
CAN SHARE THE RESULT BUT TO ME

03:50:33.052 --> 03:50:34.520
THAT ALSO ADDRESSES THE POWER

03:50:34.587 --> 03:50:36.088
DYNAMIC ISSUE THE ISSUE IS AND

03:50:36.155 --> 03:50:37.290
REALLY TO. NOTE THE PRIVACY

03:50:37.356 --> 03:50:38.124
ISSUE REALLY ISN'T THE

03:50:38.191 --> 03:50:40.560
TECHNOLOGY. IT'S THE YOU KNOW

03:50:40.626 --> 03:50:42.161
THE HUMAN SIDE OF IT RIGHT SO

03:50:42.228 --> 03:50:43.663
THE TECHNOLOGY COULD KEEP IT

03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:44.730
PRIVATE BUT IT'S BASICALLY YOU

03:50:44.797 --> 03:50:45.798
I CAN IF SOMEONE'S EMPLOYER

03:50:45.865 --> 03:50:46.566
SAYS WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU

03:50:46.632 --> 03:50:49.235
CONTINUE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE

03:50:49.302 --> 03:50:49.835
TO SHARE THE RESULTS WITH ME.

03:50:49.902 --> 03:50:51.571
THE OBVIOUSLY TECHNOLOGY IS NOT

03:50:51.637 --> 03:50:53.072
THE BARRIER HERE IT'S NOW THIS

03:50:53.139 --> 03:50:54.207
POWER DYNAMIC IN OUT OF THAT'S

03:50:54.273 --> 03:50:55.641
WHAT THE SEAL IS REFERRING TO

03:50:55.708 --> 03:50:56.642
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO. SORT

03:50:56.709 --> 03:50:58.744

THANK YOU VERY GRAYSON DOCUMENT

03:51:01.180 --> 03:51:02.348
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT

03:51:02.415 --> 03:51:03.716
GET CAUGHT UP OF WHAT THIS BILL

03:51:03.783 --> 03:51:05.985
ISN'T- AND- WHAT THIS BILL

03:51:06.052 --> 03:51:09.255
REALLY IS ALL IT IS THAT IT'S-

03:51:09.322 --> 03:51:11.123
PERMISSIVE. ALLOWING SOMEBODY

03:51:11.190 --> 03:51:13.526
TO. TO ENGAGE IN VERIFY ALL

03:51:13.593 --> 03:51:14.994
VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS LIKE IN

03:51:15.061 --> 03:51:19.165
YOUR PRACTICE IF YOU WANTED TO

03:51:19.232 --> 03:51:19.732
SEND. A PATIENT A VERIFIABLE

03:51:19.799 --> 03:51:20.866
TODAY. AFTER A COVER NINETEEN

03:51:20.933 --> 03:51:22.568
TEST. THIS WOULD ALLOW YOU TO

03:51:22.635 --> 03:51:24.070
DO THAT YOU CAN DO THIS  LOT

03:51:24.136 --> 03:51:25.805
BUT IT. RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE

03:51:25.871 --> 03:51:26.939
DOING IT BUT THERE IS NOTHING

03:51:27.006 --> 03:51:28.274
THAT SAYS EITHER OR AND THERE

03:51:28.341 --> 03:51:30.209
IS NO STRUCTURE TO IT. SO WHAT

03:51:30.276 --> 03:51:31.043
THIS BILL DOES IS IT MAKES A

03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:32.178
PERMISSIVE IF THIS IS SOMETHING

03:51:32.245 --> 03:51:33.479
THAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO AS YOUR

03:51:33.546 --> 03:51:34.680
PRACTICE ON YOUR OWN. IT'S

03:51:34.747 --> 03:51:36.082
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO UNDER

03:51:36.148 --> 03:51:37.850
LAW. AND IN THE PILOT PROGRAM

03:51:37.917 --> 03:51:40.419
THROUGH GABAB. SPECIFICALLY IS

03:51:40.486 --> 03:51:41.354
GOING TO PROVIDE THE STRUCTURE.

03:51:41.420 --> 03:51:43.456
BY PUTTING- DIFFERENT

03:51:43.522 --> 03:51:45.258
STAKEHOLDERS FROM WHETHER IT'S

IN THE BEST MOST SAFE- WAY.

03:51:51.631 --> 03:51:53.466
WHILE WITH A FOCUS ON PRIVACY.

03:51:53.532 --> 03:51:55.001

THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T ABOUT

03:52:00.840 --> 03:52:02.174
DIGITAL IDEAS THIS IS JUST A

03:52:02.241 --> 03:52:05.811
FAIRY. VERY NARROW. USE CASE-

03:52:05.878 --> 03:52:07.280
AND IT ND IT'S GONNA PROVIDE

03:52:07.346 --> 03:52:10.283
SOME PROTECTIONS AND SOME GUARD

03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:10.816
RAILS AROUND. WHAT AGAIN.

03:52:10.883 --> 03:52:12.018
ALREADY DOING WHEN IT COMES TO

03:52:12.084 --> 03:52:13.786
SAY AN INDUSTRY LIKE. THE

03:52:13.853 --> 03:52:15.021
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. RIGHT

03:52:15.087 --> 03:52:15.955
NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

03:52:16.022 --> 03:52:17.657
HOW WE GET COMING BACK UP IN

03:52:17.723 --> 03:52:18.824
CALIFORNIA SOME FIGURED OUT

03:52:18.891 --> 03:52:21.227
SOME HAVEN'T BUT THE BIG- IDEA

03:52:21.294 --> 03:52:21.727
OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS

03:52:21.794 --> 03:52:23.629
THEY'RE CREATING THESE BUBBLES.

03:52:23.696 --> 03:52:25.331

BUBBLE TO THEN. START WORK IN

03:52:31.671 --> 03:52:32.705
TANDEM TO BE A FILMER IN AFTER

HAVE- A NEGATIVE RESULTS SO

03:52:42.982 --> 03:52:43.516
THAT YOU'RE NOT BRINGING

ANYBODY WHO HAS. THAT RESULTS

03:52:45.818 --> 03:52:47.987
THAT THEY GET A POSITIVE RESULT

03:52:48.054 --> 03:52:49.322
IN TO THE FACILITY INTO BUBBLE

03:52:49.388 --> 03:52:54.293
IN ANY. COMING IN TO WORK. IN

03:52:54.360 --> 03:52:55.261
SPECIFIC AND- SIX OF THEY CAN A-

03:52:55.328 --> 03:52:56.896
THAT IT'S COMPLETE SAFE I. CAN

03:52:56.962 --> 03:52:58.297
PROVE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE

03:52:58.364 --> 03:53:00.032
TO. GET THAT VERIFIABLE

03:53:00.099 --> 03:53:01.033
CREDENTIALS ARE APPROVED THAT

03:53:01.100 --> 03:53:02.268
TEST AND I COULD BE ON YOUR

03:53:02.335 --> 03:53:03.469
SMARTPHONE THAT CAN BE A Q. R.

03:53:03.536 --> 03:53:04.537
CODE THAT IS PRINTED OUT ON A

03:53:04.603 --> 03:53:06.038
PIECE OF PAPER. DEPENDING ON

03:53:06.105 --> 03:53:06.772
WHETHER YOU HAVE A SMARTPHONE

03:53:06.839 --> 03:53:08.874
OR NOT- AND IT'S SO IT'S- IT'S

03:53:08.941 --> 03:53:10.076
SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY IN

03:53:10.142 --> 03:53:11.744
USE. WERE ALLOWING IT TO BE

03:53:11.811 --> 03:53:13.379
MORE PERMISSIVE IN LOSS OF

03:53:13.446 --> 03:53:14.146
PEOPLE CAN USE IT AND ARE

03:53:14.213 --> 03:53:15.848
PROVIDING SOME STRUCTURE TO IT.

03:53:15.915 --> 03:53:17.583
AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THIS

03:53:17.650 --> 03:53:19.618
THIS FITS IN- AND PROVIDES I

03:53:19.685 --> 03:53:20.786
THINK WHAT IT THAT NECESSARY

03:53:20.853 --> 03:53:22.221
STRUCTURE IS. ALSO THE SAME

03:53:22.288 --> 03:53:23.889
TIME UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE

03:53:23.956 --> 03:53:25.291
BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP- THAT

03:53:25.358 --> 03:53:26.492
I CREATED THAT IS FINISHED

03:53:26.559 --> 03:53:27.760
DELIVERED ITS REPORT TO THE

03:53:27.827 --> 03:53:30.229
STATE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR

03:53:30.296 --> 03:53:32.531
JUST JUST IN JULY. LOOK AT THIS

03:53:32.598 --> 03:53:34.100
THERE STAKEHOLDERS FROM WITHIN

03:53:34.166 --> 03:53:34.700
BLOCKCHAIN STAKEHOLDERS FROM

03:53:34.767 --> 03:53:36.502
AND PRIVACY RIGHTS. ADVOCACY

03:53:36.569 --> 03:53:37.670
GROUPS THAT ALL AGREED THAT

03:53:37.737 --> 03:53:38.371
THIS IS A BILL THEY NEED TO

OPINION AND ITS SECOND SECONDLY

05:18:04.031 --> 05:18:07.034
IS EQUITY EQUITY NOT EVERYBODY

GOINGTO AN ORTHODONTIST IS

05:18:10.938 --> 05:18:13.641
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE- I LOOK AT

THE DATA SAID MY DISTRICT WHICH

05:18:15.242 --> 05:18:16.544

OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS MY
