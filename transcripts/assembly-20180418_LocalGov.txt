THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HER. THAT I KNOW THAT EVERY MEMBER IN THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS THAT IN OUR STATE WE ARE EXPERIENCING NOT JUST THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS. IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY BUT HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. ONE THAT WE SEE WITH HEPATITIS A ANY COLI OUTBREAKS TENT ENCAMPMENTS OF THE DEVASTATION CAUSED BY FIRE MUDSLIDES. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST HOMELESSNESS RATE IN THE COUNTRY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF AMERICANS WHO ARE HOMELESS LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. FORTY TWO PERCENT OF AMERICA'S CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ARE IN OUR STATE. WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE HIGHEST RECENT INCREASES AND HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A BILL TO MOVE FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH IS HOUSING THAT IS PAIRED WITH SERVICES A PROVEN METHOD OF REDUCING HOMELESSNESS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS. THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. WE'VE HEARD FROM DEVELOPERS THAT BUILT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THAT IT OFTEN MAY TAKE THREE YEARS TO BUILD BECAUSE OF LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS HE'S. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO STREAMLINE THE APPROVAL OF A HUNDRED PERCENT AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS THAT INCLUDE A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS. ARMED SERVICES WOULD NEED TO BE PROVIDED ON SITE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO APPLY OBJECTIVE AND QUANTIFIABLE DESIGN STANDARDS. ONE AT THIS POINT TURN IT OVER TO MY JOINT AUTHORS MR DAILY REPRESENTING THE DISTRICT THAT HAS HAS. AS INTENSE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AS WE'VE SEEN AROUND THE STATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHIU. YES SIR IN MY HOME COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY THE DEBATE OVER HOW AND WHERE TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS IS REACHED THE COURTS PROMPTING A FEDERAL JUDGE TO INTERVENE. AND OVERSEE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. RESEARCHERS AT UC IRVINE. IN MY HOME COUNTY. HAVE FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COST OF SERVICES FOR THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS DECLINED. WHEN THEY ARE PLACED IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. TO THAT END. THE CITY OF SANTA ANA THE COUNTY SEAT. IN ORANGE COUNTY RECENTLY APPROVED A LARGE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECT. THIS IS ALL IN MY DISTRICT. A DEVELOPER CONVERTED IN OLD MOTEL INTO A SEVENTY TWO UNIT. COMMUNITY DEDICATED TO CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL FAMILIES. THERE'S A NON PROFIT INVOLVED MERCY HOUSE WHICH PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR THE RESIDENTS. THIS BILL. WILL HELP PROMOTE THE CONSTRUCTION OF MORE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS LIKE THIS ONE. IN AREAS WHERE CITIES ALREADY PLAN FOR AND ALLOW MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT. THE BILL EXPEDITES THE TIMELINE FOR APPROVAL OF OF THESE PROJECTS. WHICH WILL HELP LOWER THE COST OF BUILDING AND THEREBY INCENTIVIZE OTHERS. TO CONSTRUCT SUCH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE PROJECTS. WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL ZONING BUT THIS IS ONE MORE TOOL TO ENABLE THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. TO. TO ACHIEVE THAT END. SO I RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST AN AYE VOTE SO. WHEN WE GET TO THAT POINT. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU DON'T MIND WE'RE GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF HOUSEKEEPING BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD. DIXIE WHICH PLEASE ESTABLISH QUORUM. ADWARE CURRY THEIR AGUIAR CURRY HERE WALDRON BLOOM CABALLERO COOLEY GRAYSON. GRAYSON HERE LACKEY. LACKEY HERE STONE. STONE HERE VOEPEL. VOEPEL HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE WILL MOVEON YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT LIKE TO TURN OVER TO OUR SPONSORS. I AM DIANE WITH TERM ADVOCACY MENTOR FOR EA EIGHT HOUSING. WE ARE A NONPROFIT DEVELOPER WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR FIFTY YEARS NOW THIS YEAR. A WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN PROPERTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN HAWAII. ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT OF THOSE PROPERTIES HAVE UNITS THAT ARE SET ASIDE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN OTHER WORDS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT THIS BILL. EYES TRYING TO ENABLE. WE HAVE FOUR MORE THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE. SOME OF OUR PROJECTS HAVE. A PORTION OF THEM THAT ARE PERMITS PART OF HOUSING AND SOME ARE A HUNDRED PERCENT. SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AN EXAMPLE IS THE POINT ON VERMONT. IN LOS ANGELES A PROJECT THAT IS NOW IN THE PIPELINE THAT WHERE THE DEVELOPERS FOR NOW BE HUNDRED PERCENT PSH. THAT PROJECT WILL MOVE ALONG WELL BECAUSE LOS ANGELES HAS ADOPTED STREAMLINING FOR OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND WE FIGURED THAT THAT'LL SAVE US PROBABLY ONE TO TWO YEARS. ON THAT PROJECT. WHENEVER WE ARE LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL SITE FOR. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OF COURSE WE LOOK AT. AMENITIES SERVICES LOCATION THINGS LIKE THAT A BUT WE ALSO LOOK AT WHAT IS THE LOCAL SUPPORT AND AND POSSIBLE OPPOSITION TO THE PROJECT AND. IF WE DO SEE THAT NEIGHBORS ARE. REALLY OPPOSED IN REALLY WELL ORGANIZED AND SOMETIMES WILL BACK OFF AND NOT DO THE PROJECT AT ALL. BUT MORE TYPICALLY WILL STICK WITH IT. AND. IT'LL COST US ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO OF THE PROJECT WHICH MAKES THE PROJECT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. IT'S LESS EFFICIENT IN TERMS OF USING THE PROPER TAXPAYERS DOLLARS AND ALSO AT LEAST PEOPLE ON THE STREETS LAWYER. SO. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO WOULD HELP US IN SEVERAL WAYS WHO WOULD MAKE THE PROJECTS MORE FEASIBLE AND MORE PREDICTABLE. IT WOULD MAKE MORE SITES AVAILABLE TO US FOR THAT PURPOSE AND. WOULD BE MAKE PROJECTS MORE COST EFFECTIVE. BY ELIMINATING WHAT WE CALL ENTITLEMENT RISK. WE KNOW THAT WE CAN TALK TO LENDERS AND INVESTORS AND THEY'LL COME ON BOARD SOONER AND WITH MORE MONEY. BECAUSE THEY'RE SURE THAT THE PROJECT WILL. GO FORWARD. SO IF WE HAVE THIS IN PLACE THEN WE CAN USE LOCAL FUNDS WE CAN USE THE UPCOMING STATE PHONE FUNDS. WE CAN USE NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDS THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY GOING TO PSH. WE CAN ALL STEP UP AND AND GET IT DONE A A LOT FASTER. THE BILL WOULD ALSO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MEET THEIR RENO OBLIGATIONS. TO CLEAN UP THEIR STREETS AND ALSO IT WOULD FREE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM HAVING TO TAKE DIFFICULT. VOTES AND TAKE POLITICAL RISK BY SUPPORTING AND THESE PROJECTS SO. AS A NONPROFIT THAT'S IN THE TRENCHES OF TRYING TO GET THESE ARE HOUSING THIS HOUSING BUILT. I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO OUR HOUSING CHAMPIONS HERE. AT THE LEGISLATURE AND TO YOU ALL FOR DOING THE WORK THAT HELPS US. GET THIS WORK DONE. I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION THANK YOU. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING WHERE ONE OF THE BILL'S CO SPONSORS. AND WE KNOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS PLUS WORTH OF DATA SHOW SUPPORTIVE HOUSING NOT ONLY. IMPROVES HOUSING AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IT ALSO REDUCES OF LOCAL AND STATE COSTS FOR HEALTH CORRECTIONS CHILD WELFARE. SYSTEMS DATA ALSO SHOW SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IMPROVES PROPERTY VALUES AND REDUCES BLIGHT IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT'S SPELLED. YEAH IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO BUILD TO A REQUIRES OVER TEN SOURCES OF FUNDING ON AVERAGE AND TO BE COMPETITIVE FOR FUNDING. WE KNOW SUPPORTIVE HOUSING HAS TO BE GREENER HOUSES SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND IT HAS TO GET COMMUNITY SUPPORT. AB TWO TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO WOULD ALLOW SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. PROVIDERS TO RECEIVE MY RIGHT APPROVAL WHICH WILL SPECIFICALLY WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPEDITE THE PROCESS AND AS MS LUTHER. SAID WOULD BE CHEAPER TO BUILD. THE BILL WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT DEVELOPMENTS WILL BILL BILL BE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING. AND. ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD WITH STATE FUNDING IN THE PAST AND GOING OUT SLOWLY. IT WOULD ENSURE IN FACT THAT FUNDING WILL BE USED TO AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HOUSE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. AND OTHER VULNERABILITIES. WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS.

A MAN CHAIR ACROSS THE COUNTRY GENERAL SENSE OF UNREST HAS FILLED MANY COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. MONEY MANY REASONS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY COMMON ACQUISITION OF MILITARY STYLE EQUIPMENT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. RECOGNIZING THE HEIGHTENED TENSION BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE PRESIDENT OBAMA CONVENED A FEDERAL INTER AGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT. EQUIPMENT WORKING GROUP UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER THIRTEEN SIX EIGHTY EIGHT I IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IN THE SIZE THE NEED TO BETTER COORDINATE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN FEDERAL EQUIPMENT BY STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AMONG OTHER ISSUESTHE WORKING GROUP DEVELOPED A LIST OF ITEMS THAT THEY DETERMINED AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONTROLS PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. LAST SUMMER. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION RESCINDED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THIRTEEN SIX EIGHTY EIGHT ALONG WITH MANY OF THE POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS GOVERNING APPROPRIATE CONSTITUTIONALLY SOUND USES OF CONTROLLED EQUIPMENT. TODAY'S BILL AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE REQUIRES ALL LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO OBTAIN APPROVAL BY THE GOVERNING BODIES. THE COUNCIL'S BOARD TO SUPERVISORS A PRIOR TO APPLYING TO RECEIVING MILITARY EQUIPMENT MADE AVAILABLE UNDER THE MILITANT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S MILITARY EQUIPMENT SURPLUS PROGRAM. BY ACQUIRING A PUBLIC PLATFORM TO ALLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS THE BILL WILL IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIPS POLICE HAVE WITH THE COMMUNITY WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SEEN AS A PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICE. RATHER THAN OCCUPYING FORCE. IT'S MORE THIS AFTERNOON WE HAVE WITNESSES. TO GIVE TESTIMONY BUT TO THE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER NOW TO MY JOINT AUTHORS MR CHIU. THANK YOU WANT TO THANK. MISTER GLORIA AND. IMAGINE THIS IS A BILL THAT I THOUGHT OF MOVING FOR AND THEN I DISCOVERED OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WAS ALSO DOING IT SO WELL. REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UP TO WORK TOGETHER AND I WANT TO THANK AMONG THE MANY SPONSORS I INDIVISIBLE THE CHAPTERS IN MY CITY AND AROUND THE STATE FOR. THEIR SUPPORT OF THIS UP FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO GIVE NECESSARY PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OVER WHEN AND WHY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD NEED TO ACQUIRE. MILITARY GRADE WEAPONS WE KNOW THAT OUR CITIZENS ARE NOT ENEMY COMBATANTS OUR POLICE ARE NOT MILITARY GENERALS AND ARE SPEAKING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WE KNOW THAT ALL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN OUR STATE WANT TO BE PARTNERS IN PUBLIC SAFETY WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE WEAPONS THAT THEY CARRY SHOULD REFLECT THAT REALITY. I DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE HERE IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD NOT REPEALED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. OF PREVIOUS PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT HAD REQUIRED THIS LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY THIS BILL IS NOT SAYING THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CANNOT AT SOME POINT RECEIVE THESE MILITARY WEAPONS ALL WERE SAYING IS THAT WE NEED TRANSPARENCY. AND WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY AND WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE. MEMBER SINCE SUPPORT PROJECT TO SPEAK WITH TWO WITNESSES THE SAID THIS AFTERNOON YES. MY NAME IS JOHN LINDSAY POLAND THEM WITH THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE. MANY LOCAL LEADERS ARE AWARE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT ACQUIRED FROM PENTAGON SURPLUS STOCKS OR GRANTS FOR PURCHASES. MUCH LESS INFORMED OF IMPACTS IN A TO ALTERNATIVES OR ABLE TO EXERCISE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT. AND PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGETS RARELY DETAIL THE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT AGENCIES ACQUIRE USING LOCAL FUNDS. SAN DIEGO YOU S. D. N. DAVIS RETURNED A MILITARY ARE ARMORED VEHICLE AND UC BERKELEY CANCELED AN ORDER FOR ONE PRECISELY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PROCESS FOR LAWMAKERS AND COMMUNITIES. TO REVIEW THESE ACQUISITIONS. EQUIPMENT RANGES FROM BATONS THAT CAN BE EXTENT EXPANDED WITH BLADES TO HIGH CALIBER SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES THAT ARE INCREASINGLY DEPLOYED FOR ORDINARY POLICING. CALIFORNIA AGENCIES HAVE ACQUIRED MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND MILITARY RIFLES FROM THE US MILITARY. WE HAVE THE MILITARY EQUIPMENT BUT NOT TRANSPARENT GUIDELINES ABOUT WHAT IS FOR AND HOW IT WILL BE USED AND NOT USED. HAVING THE CONVERSATION UP FRONT RATHER THAN LATER GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OVERSIGHT TO PROTECT TAXPAYER MONIES AND DECIDE LOCAL STANDARDS FOR THE COMMUNITIES THEY REPRESENT. AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE ALSO MANDATES REPORTING THAT ALLOWS LAWMAKERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE AND IMPACT OF EQUIPMENT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS. IT EMPOWERS OUR LOCAL ELECTED GOVERNMENTS TO SET BASELINE STANDARDS FOR WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IN A PLACE THAT IS NOT AT WAR. NOR OCCUPIED BY HOSTILE FORCES PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU WELCOME. MY NAME IS KAT PERKS I AM THE COFOUNDER OF ANTI POLICE TEAR PROJECT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE JUSTICE TEAMS NETWORK. I FOR OVER A DECADE HAVE WORKED WITH FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE SEVERELY BEEN IMPACTED BY POLICE VIOLENCE. MILITARIZED POLICING HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT ON BLACK BODIES BLACK MEN ARE KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AT A RATE THAT IS NEARLY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF WHITE MEN. AND SIXTY PERCENT OF ALL BLACK WOMEN THAT ARE KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE ON ARMED AT THE TIME. MILITARIZE WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT CREATE A MILITARIZED MINDSET OFFICERS WHO PATROL COMMUNITIES WITH MILITARY GRADE WEAPONS PETE RESIDENTS LIKE ENEMY COMBATANTS RATHER THAN TAXPAYERS WHO FUND THEIR SALARIES AND WHOM THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO SERVE. MOST RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE MURDER STEP ON CLARK WHO WAS SHOT DEAD FOR HAVING A CELLPHONE AND HANDCUFFED BEFORE BEING GIVEN MEDICAL TREATMENT. A PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL TOLL OF MILITARIZED POLICING CAUSES GREAT DISTRESS AND ALREADY STRESSED COMMUNITIES. I AM OFTEN ASKED THAT THERE'S BEEN AN UPSURGE IN POLICE VIOLENCE OF THE LAST DECADE OR SO THE ANSWER IS YES AND THAT UPSURGE IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARMING THE OFFICERS WITH MILITARY EQUIPMENT AS DEMONSTRATED BY NUMEROUS RECENT REPORTS. INCLUDING ONE BY THE WASHINGTON POST. ALAMEDA COUNTY AT A MODERATE ON SIXTEEN GUNNED DOWN BY AN AIR FIFTEEN WHILE SHE SAT IN HER CAR SHE WAS UNHARMED AND NOT THE TARGET. LOS ANGELES COUNTY MICHAEL NEED A THIRTY ONE FATALLY SHOT MY BACK WITH A SUBMACHINE GUN AFTER HE WAS MISTAKEN PRESS UPS BUT SUSPECT WANTED AN ARMED ROBBERY UNHARMED. MONTEREY COUNTY PAY TWO POINT SIX MILLION TO THE FAMILY OF A MAN WHO DIED AFTER SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES THROUGH A PLASTIC BANG GRENADES OR HIS WINDOW. WAS LATER DETERMINED HE WAS NOT INVOLVED WITH THE SWAT TEAM WITH INVESTIGATED AND WITH AN ARMED IN THE HOUSE. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE NOT ALWAYS HAVE THIS EQUIPMENT. AND WE SHOULD RESIST THE NORMALIZATION OF MILITARIZATION OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS IS NOT GOOD FOR COMMUNITIES IT IS NOT GOOD FOR POLICE. IF WE CANNOT GET TO A PLACE FOR THESE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT ARE BANNED ALTOGETHER WISHED AT LEAST HAVE THE HUMANITY AND COMMON SENSE TO ENSURE THOSE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF EQUIPMENT IS COMING IN THE COMMUNITIES AND WHAT IT IS BEING USED FOR THIS IS THE LOWEST POSSIBLE BAR OF ACCOUNTABILITY. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS CONSTANTLY SAYING THEY WANT TO IMPROVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITIES TREATING SOUTH LOS ANGELES EAST OAKLAND OR THE BAYVIEW LIKE IRAQ AFGHANISTAN AND SEE IT SYRIA. IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PLEASE JOIN US AND YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. IN A POSITION. THERE. I'M HERE AS. THE ACL ALSO. ALSO HERE IN THE OF THE COURAGE CAMPAIGN IN STRONG SUPPORT AS WELL. THANK YOU.

ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT SING NONE WILL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SING THEN. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. O. SKEWS ME COME ON UP GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH ARE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATION WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER TO ACQUISITION OF MILITARY SURPLUS PROPERTY OFTEN REQUIRES BIDDERS TO RESPOND QUICKLY. WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN APPROVAL BY LEGISLATIVE BODY FOR EACH PURCHASE. EVEN IF THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO THE FIRST TIME. AND AGENCY SEEKS TO ACQUIRE A CERTAIN EQUIPMENT EIGHTY THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE WAS SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIA AGENCIES IN THIS ATTEMPTED PARTICIPATION. ADDITIONALLY THE TYPE OF PROPERTY CONTEMPLATED BY DISPEL IS EXCEEDINGLY FAST AND INCLUDES ITEMS COMMONLY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING HELICOPTERS AND FIXED WING AIRCRAFT. ALSO THE BILL'S LANGUAGE IS VAGUE AT BEST AS IT ATTEMPTS TO EXCLUDE ACQUISITION OF ANY FIRE ARM FOR VAI I'M ACCESSORY DOESN'T THAT IS DESIGNED TO LAUNCH SMALL EXPLOSIVE PROJECTILES. A DEFINITION THAT ARGUABLY INCLUDES ALL FIREARMS. AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY OF INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS TO ACQUIRE EQUIPMENT AT A COST SAVINGS FOR DEPLOYMENT FOR LONG FORSMAN PURPOSES. DELEON LIKE THAT SHERIFFS ARE CERTAINLY CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO CONCERNS. BY THEIR CONSTITUENTS WHEN IT COMES TO PURCHASING AND DEPLOYMENT OF APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT SHOULD THEY ARISE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY PROFESSIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT NINE THOUSAND. DEPUTY SHERIFF'S INVESTIGATORS WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND PEACE OFFICERS WITH THE UC CORONER'S OFFICE. THE WOULD FIRST OF ALL INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE STATE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION. OF. ASK YOU TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE TIME FRAME ISSUE WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD OF A HEARING AND ALL OF THAT BY THAT TIME. THE TEN THIRTY THREE EQUIPMENT IS GONE IT'S IT'S GONE TO SOMEBODY ELSE. THE BILL. FEAR HIM WE UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE DON'T DISPUTE THAT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS THAT. WHEN I AM MUCH OF THIS EQUIPMENT IS ACQUIRED LOCAL AGENCIES CONVERTED. TO DIFFERENT USES. IT DOESN'T HAVE A STRICTLY SPEAKING MILITARY. USE. IT SIMPLY COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT RATHER THAN. THIS. OF THEY CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE WHICH IS. BURDENSOME AND COMPLICATED AND. IT. REALLY WILL RESULT IN. AGENCIES NOT BEING ABLE TO GET NEEDED. EQUIPMENT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT. INSTEAD LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT. TAKING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THAT SEEMED TO BE THE GRAV AMOUNT OF THE COMPLAINT THAT LED TO THE BILL TO BEGIN WITH. AND LET'S LOOK AT HOW WE CAN CRAFT. STATE LEGISLATION. THAT REFLECTS THE INTENT AND THRUST OF THAT INITIAL OF OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WOULD SEEM TO US TO BE. A RATIONAL APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT THE AUTHORS OF SAID THEY'VE SAID HEY WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE BUT FOR THE RECISION. SO LET'S LOOK AT A CREATIVE WAY TO DO THAT. BUT. AS FOR AND WERE WILLING TO WORK. OF FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT AS. WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT BILL WE MUST DIE OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY BEING NONE. OTHER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SO REMEMBER GRAYSON. MAYBE NOT SO MUCH QUESTIONS BUT I DO HAVE A FEW COMMENTS. AND I DO. THANK YOU TO OF BOTH. FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AYE I SHARE CONCERNS OF THE MILITARIZATION. OF OUR LOCAL SAFETY AGENCIES. AND THE NEED FOR ANY AND ALL EFFORTS TO BE PUT FORTH TO BUILD PUBLIC TRUST. WITH OUR POLICE FORCE AS A SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. AND NOT A PRESENT FORCE. SO WITH THAT. SUPPORT YA I AM I'M GOING TO SUPPORT. THE BILL GETTING OUT COMMITTEE TODAY HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ESPECIALLY THE BILL'S PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE. AND DICTATING AND RECIPE FORM HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE TO DO THEIR JOB AND AGREEMENT THAT REMAINS A CONSERVE. AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE DISCREPANCIES IN THE LIST OF BANNED ITEMS FOR INSTANCE THERE MAY BE SOME ITEMS THAT ARE IN THAT BAND LIST. THAT. A CITIZEN CAN GO TO OF MILITARY SURPLUS STORE AND ACTUALLY PURCHASE THEMSELF. AND. OTHER AND IN OTHER ITEMS WHERE A LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY COULD ACTUALLY GO TO A THIRD PARTY VENDOR. AND PURCHASE IT OUTSIDE OF THE REVIEW PROCESS THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY CALLING FOR BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY NOT COMING FROM A MILITARY A TRANSFER FROM THE MILITARY AND. THEY MAY PAY THREE FOUR. TEN TIMES MORE. THAT WAY AND. AGAIN I BELIEVE HELICOPTERS WAS ONE OF THE LISTED ITEMS THAT THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE OF USE SO WITH THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS. I WILL BE WATCHING THE BILL'S A PROGRESSES FORWARD AND. REMAIN TO KEEP MY PRIVILEGE TO. TAKE A DIFFERENT POSITION BUT HOWEVER RIGHT NOW I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT THE THE BILL FORWARD AND ADDRESSING OF THE MILITARIZATION OF OUR OUR LOCAL AGENCIES. THANK YOU. SOME RECOVERY ERA. THINK VERY MUCH A MADAM CHAIR I. I I I FEEL MUCH AS. MISTER GRAYSON DOES NOT LET ME JUST SAY THAT. WHEN I WAS ON THIS CITY COUNCIL FOR THE CITY OF SALINAS. ANY OF THESE PURCHASES WERE BROUGHT BEFORE OUR. OUR COUNCIL AND WE MADE THE DECISIONS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION WERE GIVEN SOME I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE. THE ISSUE ABOUT HAVING TO ACT QUICKLY MAYBE THAT. THE PROCESS HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF ACCESSING. THIS EQUIPMENT ABOUT. WE CERTAINLY HAD NO PROBLEM. SAID IT AGENDA ICING SOMETHING WE MET EVERY WEEK SO IF THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET EQUIPMENT. UP THE POLICE DEPARTMENT USUALLY I THOUGHT DID A PRETTY THOROUGH AND THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND CAME TO US WITH THAT ISSUE AND WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ON IT SO IT MAKES SENSE TO ME. ON THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE I WANT YOU TO JUST THINK ABOUT AND I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I AM OUT I I AGREE THAT TIME. PART OF WHAT. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT PARTICIPATE. BUT. AYE I AM IT IS. INTRIGUING TO MEDIA USE THE LANGUAGE OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER TO LOOK AT THAT AND TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S A WAIT OF MER. WHITE WAS ABOUT. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER I I DON'T HAVE ANY FROM ME SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. BUT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT THAT MIGHT BE THAT THERE'S SOME OVERLAP THERE THAT MIGHT BE AND A WAY TO GO BUT I. I I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION FOR US TO HAVE. AND. I THINK ALL OF US WANT OUR POLICE OFFICERS TO BE TREATED WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT AND PART OF THAT RESPECT IS IS WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY IN HAVING THE COMMUNITY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A STAKE IN THE MATTER AS WELL SO. BUT I BUT I AM I AM I AM COGNIZANT OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED HERE TODAY SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT PROGRESSES. THEN SHARED IT IS HELPFUL TO THE COMMITTEE. DE EVA BUT IT RAN FROM A CELL USE HERE SHE CAN SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF THE CONTRACTS FOR THE OBAMA EXECUTIVE ORDER I THINK IT IS LESS THAN WHAT WAS PUT ARE DESCRIBED BY THE OPPONENTS. NOTIFYING PLEASE GO PROCEED VERY MUCH ON. IN MANY WAYS THIS THIS. PROPOSED BILL DOES IN FACT NEAR THE OBAMA EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT IN IN SEVERAL RESPECTS IT DIFFERS ONE IMPORTANT ONE IS THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ACTUALLY HAD A CATEGORY OF BAND EQUIPMENT THAT WAS BANNED ALTOGETHER. THIS PROPOSED BILL DOES NOT MAKE THAT DISTINCTION BUT RATHER IMPOSES THIS PROCEDURE FOR POTENTIALLY ACQUIRING. THIS MILITARY EQUIPMENT WITHOUT MAKING THE DISTINCTION OF WHETHER IT'S BANNED OR NOT SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S A BIT MORE PERMISSIVE TOWARD LAW ENFORCEMENT EVEN THEN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER OF COURSE DIDN'T IMPOSE A SPECIFIC LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCEDURE FOR APPROVING. BEEN A IT DIDN'T SET AND IN THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL OF COURSE THE PROCEDURE FOR APPROVING ACQUISITION OF THIS EQUIPMENT. UP IT DID SORT OF SET SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE THAT HAD TO BE MET BEFORE THE PERMISSIVE LIST COULD BE TRANSFERRED INCLUDING DEMONSTRATING. THE IMPACT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE USE WHICH IS ALREADY MIRRORED IN IN THE IN THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION CRESCENTA. I. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL FORD. IN YOLO COUNTY WE HAD. A LOT OF HOOPLA OVER A PURCHASE OF. A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT NOT EVERYBODY AGREED TO DO SO THE NUMBER ONE THING I TAKE FROM THIS IS TO HAPPEN NOW THERE'S A PROCESS. AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR. TO THE. TO THE LOCALS WHAT HAND HOW THINGS ARE DONE SO APPRECIATE GOING THAT BECAUSE WE'VE HAD QUITE A BIT OF DISCUSSION YOLO COUNTY. AND IT KIND OF I DID OUR COMMUNITY. SO IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING A PROCESS GOING FORWARD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL THE DAY. MOVE APPROVAL. THERE. HEY WE HAVE A MOTION. SOME OF MY AERO SECOND BY. STONE. WHICH I COMPOSE I KNOW YOU PRESSED FOR TIME MADAM CHAIR SO ABOUT MY LOCAL AUTHOR HERE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. DITTO. OKAY SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. EMOTION IS DUE PASS AND WE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. ADWARE CURRY AYE AGUIAR CURRY AYE WALDRON. WALDRON NO BLOOM. BLOOM AYE CABALLERO AYE COMPARE AYE COOLEY. COOLEY AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE LACKEY NO LACKEY NO STONE. STONE AYE VOEPEL. BILLS OUT SIX TO. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME ALL LET'S MOVE ONTO ITEM NUMBER. ELEVEN AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ONE ASK OF MR GRAYSON TO MOVE FROM HIS COMFORTABLE CHAIR BUTTA. APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE. WELL LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND WE WILL BE. ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE DISCUSSED WITH THE COMMITTEE WHICH I'LL MENTION IN A MOMENT A COLLEAGUES THIS IS A NARROWLY TAILORED TRANSIT ORIENTED BILL. IT SAY SUBREGIONAL BILL IMPACTS A PORTION OF THE BAY AREA ARE THE BAY AREA THAT IS SUFFERING FROM TO CRISES. WE HAVE BEEN THE EPICENTER OF THE HOUSING CRISIS THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS AND WERE ALSO EXPERIENCING A VERY INTENSE CONGESTION CRISIS. WE KNOW COUNTLESS BAY AREA RESIDENTS WERE FORCED TO LIVE FARTHER FROM THEIR JOBS LAST YEAR AREA RESIDENTS SPENT. EIGHTY HOURS A YEAR EXTRA IN TRAFFIC AND CONGESTION ON TOP OF THEIR ALREADY LENGTHENING COMMUTES. THIS BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY TO LAND AROUND PART THAT IS OWN BY PART WHICH TODAY ARE WE OF STATIONS THAT ARE SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF ACRES. OF PARKING LOTS WHICH AT NIGHT ARE LOTS THAT SIT COMPLETELY VACANT COMPLETELY UNUSED. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE PARK BOARD TO ESTABLISH BROUGHT TO THE ZONING STANDARDS TO GOVERN HIGH DENSITY PARKING. TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT A CITY WOULD HAVE TO YEARS TO CRAFT LOCAL ZONING RULES CONSISTENT WITH THAT AND% WE WOULD REQUIRE TWENTY PERCENT AFFORDABILITY. IN THOSE MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR WE'VE AGREED TO AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD EXEMPT CITIES THAT MEET MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARENA. AS WELL AS ENSURE THAT LOCAL DESIGN GUIDELINES RULE. THIS MEASURE ALSO ENSURES THAT THERE IS LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY IT WOULD ONLY APPLY TO THOSE PARTS STATIONS WHERE THERE IS A PARK ELECTED DIRECTOR WHO IS ACCOUNTABLE TO CONSTITUENTS AROUND THAT PART STATION. THE HISTORY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE. THERE HAVE BEEN COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE HAS BEEN HOUSING BUILT AROUND THEM BUT OFTENTIMES IN THIS COMMITTEE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES IT WOULD TAKE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS OR LONGER WITH SIGNIFICANT DELAYS. AND THEN AROUND OTHER PARTS STATIONS IN THE FORTY FIVE YEARS SINCE THE SPARC STATIONS OPEN. THERE WAS THERE IS NO HOUSING THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE AYE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF OUR SPONSORS OF ALONG WITH THE BUILDING TRADES OF THE NONPROFIT. HOUING ASSOCIATION MICHAEL. CHEROKEE ARE CURRY MEMBERS MICHAEL AND WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN THE BARE LAND CAN GO FOR MORE THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS PER ACRE PUBLICLY HELD LANDS A VALUABLE AND PRECIOUS RESOURCE. GIVEN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTED IN PLANNED TO BE INVEST IN THE BART SYSTEM. THIS LAND MUST BE USED WISELY AND PROVIDE REAL COMMUNITY BENEFITS. PRIOR TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN ADOPTION ABORTS TO THE GUIDELINES. THERE WAS A MORE THAN TWO YEAR PUBLIC PROCESS WHICH MY ORGANIZATION PAGE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN. AND THE SMARTER PROGRESSIVE GUIDELINES ARE WELL KNOWN. PUBLICLY. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICY INCLUDED IN THESE GUIDELINES IS EXCELLENT. AND WE NEED THE COOPERATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. FOR THIS TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IN ADDITION THE STATE ALREADY HAS SIGNIFICANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE WHICH ALREADY HAVE THESE POLICIES AND BETTER THAN THE MEN WE NEED THE SITES TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT LOS THOSE FINANCING TOOLS. A TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE DESIGN STANDARDS AND THE DENSITY IS NEEDED TO MAKE PROJECTS FEASIBLE WE NEED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ALIGN THEIR ZONING THEIR POLICIES AND GUIDELINES WITH THOSE THAT PART HAS LAID OUT. THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE. POP PUBLIC PROCESS AND WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE SITES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. FOR THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SOUTHERN MATT NAT WITH LIGHTHOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIANS PART OF THE BILL THINK YOU. MADAM CHAIR ANOTHER MEMBER SPOILER BE HAVE THE CITY AND COUNTY CENSUS GOOD SPORT ABOUT. JOSHUA STARK ON BEHALF OF TRANSFORM IN BAY AREA THREE FIFTY IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT I MATTHEW BAKER WITH PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAGUE PCL IS NOT TAKEN A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL. WE ARE STILL CONSIDERING SOME OF THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED BY PUBLIC ADVOCATES BUT. WE DO SO A CONCEPTUALLY SUPPORT THAT THE BASIC TENANTS OF THIS BILL HAVE PERMITS FORWARD THINKING. LET SHEPHERD REPRESENTING THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP AND THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER ONES ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES UNFORTUNATELY WE WE ARE HERE TO OPPOSE. CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE YOU KNOW THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS EFFORTS ON HOUSING WE'VE YOU KNOW HE'S THE IS THE LEADER I BELIEVE IN THE IN THIS HOUSE I'M THAT'S PUSHING HOUSING LEGISLATION. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THE BILL'S CURLY DRAFTED WE WE DO HAVE TO OPPOSE OUR PRIMARY OBJECTION IS THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE A CONSTITUTIONALLY GRANTED POWER FROM THE OVER MISSILE FAIRS. AND PLEASE POWERS OF CITIES AND COUNTIES MEMORY GIVEN TO A SPECIAL DISTRICT AND THEN WE BELIEVE THAT'S ACTION CONSTITUTIONAL BUT. ARE YOU THE ASSUMPTION IS OF THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AND IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE RIGHT DECISION IS THE BEST THING WE CAN GIVE OFFICE. AS THE INTO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN GUIDELINES AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TWENTY SEVEN GUIDELINES BART MADE IT REALLY CLEAR THAT THEIR BEST STATIONS. REALLY COME AT THE DEVELOPMENT COMES WE WORKS WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IN A SENSE YOU KNOW THIS MEASURE WOULD WHAT ALMOST A FIVE THAT PLANE AND THEY HAD TO PUT OF MY IN PLACE A PLAN AND AND NOW. THEY'RE GONNA SAY WELL YOU KNOW MAYBE CAN CHANGE THE PLAN AND YOU KNOW NOT HAVE TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT. BART GETS TO DICTATE BASICALLY EVERYTHING ON THEIR PROPERTY NOW THE MINUTES TO HELP THEY JUST HER DOMINANCE HERE AROUND DESIGNERS YOU. BUT PARTS CAN BE THE ONE THAT'S GONNA DICTATE THE RULES ON THEIR PROPERTY YES THIS IS ONLY YOU KNOW RELATED A BAR RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD THINK THAT EVERY SPECIAL DISHES EVERY TRANSIT HE SAID OWNS PROPERTY. IS GONNA WANT TO RUN OUT AND GET SIMILAR TREATMENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND NOT HAVE TO WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES WITH THE BILL TWO IS IT ALLOWS FOR S. B. THIRTY FIVE STREAMLINING WITHIN JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE WILL REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS ARENA AND WE ALL RECALL FROM LAST YEAR WHEN THE CORNERSTONES OF S. B. THIRTY FIVE LAST YEAR. WAS THAT IT IF CITIES CAN MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS ARENA THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THE STREAMLINED UNDER SB THIRTY FIVE. THIS IS REGARDLESS OF YOUR MAKING SURE PROGRESS OR NOT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STREAMLINE UNDER SB THIRTY FIVE IF BART WANTS YOU TO DO IT. WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW SEQUEL. ON THOSE SITES AND THERE THERE'S OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO ABIDE BY. WITH THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO OPPOSE. THINK YOU. AND CITY GEORGE REPRESENTING AMERICAN PLAYING ASSOCIATION UP WE HAVE A POLICY OF. SUPPORTING INCREASED DENSITY AND AFFORDABILITY AROUND TRANSIT BUT WE CAN'T TO GRIEVE FOR THE PRESIDENT REASON AS WELL. OF WE WOULD HAVE EVERY SET SPECIAL DISTRICT ASKING TO ZONE THEIR OWN PROPERTY. WE'D DO SUPPORT THE OPTIONS THAT WERE IN THE ANALYSIS FOR THE STATION PLAN. I HAD KNOWN THAT THOSE WERE AVAILABLE AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND WORKING WITH. COLLABORATIVELY WE ALSO SUPPORT A. MINIMUM DENSITY AND AFFORDABILITY AROUND THESE PROJECTS ALLOWING THE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE. BUT WE CAN'T AGREE TO THIS. OVER RIGHT OF LOCAL PLANNING FLEXIBILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SHARON CAN SOLVE IS ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF LIVERMORE PLEASANTON DANVILLE IN DUBLIN AND XIN THINK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SINGER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WHEN YOU ARE HAVING WILK REPRESENTING CITY OF ALL THE CREEK IN OPPOSITION. OTHER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES SOME. DO YOU WANNA GO. I I DON'T I AM I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I GUESS I JUST WANNA MAKE A STATEMENT AND I I M.. ARE WERE ACTUALLY A STATEMENT AND THEN ASKED IF YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT. THE LEAGUE AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AYE I AM. I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THIS BILL AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS. THAT. THE STATE HAS. DECREED THAT WORK WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN. TRANSIT IN TRANSIT MODALITIES TO MOVE PEOPLE. AND THE. ONCE THEY'RE RESOURCES THAT HAVE GONE TOWARDS THAT HAVE BEEN LIGHT RAIL TRAINS. BART THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND. THAT'S TERRIFIC BECAUSE IT MOVES PEOPLE BUT FRANKLY NONE OF THE MONEY GETS SPENT IN RURAL CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT POPULATION TO SUPPORT IT. SO I'M OKAY WITH IS TAKING ALL OF THIS MONEY NONE OF WHICH WILL GO TOWARDS RURAL CALIFORNIA AND PUT IT IN THE CITIES. BUT THERE'S BEEN A PROMISE MADE IN THE PROMISES THAT AROUND THE TRANSIT. STOPS THAT THERE WILL BE INCREASED. OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOUSING SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BILL BENNETT BIG PARKING LOTS. SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT DRIVING IN TO TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THEY WALK RIGHT OUTSIDE THEIR DOOR AND THEY CAN TAKE THE BUS SO THEY CAN GET THEIR VERY EASILY. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT. THAT IT IS RARELY HAPPENED AROUND TRANSIT STOPS AND IN PARTICULAR. ON I THINK IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S GOING TO MOVE ON TO OTHERS TO WEATHER. FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION IN PARTICULAR AND NOW A. WHERE AT THAT COUNCILS AROUND THE TRANSIT STOPS HAVE DOWNS OWN? THE PROPERTY BECAUSE OF PUBLIC. PROTEST A PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE AND SO WE END UP. PUTTING A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY INTO THESE TRANSIT STOPS WITH THE PROMISE AND THE PROMISE NEVER COMES. TO PASS AND SO I BY A ON IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE ARE WHICH IS TO KIND OF. TAKE KIND OF TAKE OVER SOME OF THIS AYE AYE MAYBE NOT BUT I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH. IT'S MY BELIEF THAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT IS TO REQUIRE THAT BEFORE ANY. STATE DOLLARS ARE SPENT ON TRANSIT. THAT THERE HAS TO BE IN AGREEMENT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THEY SIGNED OFF ON INCREASING THE DENSITIES AND AND IF IN FACT THEY MOVED TO REDUCE DENSITIES THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY BACK. BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE DENSITY WE NEEDS AROUND THESE TRANSIT STOPS IT'S A WASTE OF. TAXPAYERS MONEY IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A BROKEN PROMISE AND SO I'M I'M HOPING THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THE THE LOCALS BECAUSE I'M A BIG BELIEVER AND LOCAL CONTROL AND IN THE ABILITY TO CONTROL AND USED IN PARTICULAR AND I KNOW BOTH YOU COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SO. I'M IN SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I REALLY THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND. AND AND HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE SO THAT. THAT IN FACT LOCALS ARE AT THE TABLE WORKING ON ON THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS WHERE WE CAN REALLY GET THE HOUSING THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED. SO THAT WERE NOT IMPACTING OTHER COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE'RE PUSHING HOUSING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY. IF I COULD JUST RESPOND FOR SECOND I REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE OUR WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL AND. AND HOW CRAFT IS CAREFULLY BUT I THINK YOUR POINT IS EXTREMELY WELL TAKEN IF WE WERE DOING THIS TODAY. WE SHOULD SAY THAT ANY JURISDICTION THAT'S GONNA RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT TRANSIT DOLLARS TO BUILD SOMETHING THE SCALE OF A PARK STATION. NEEDS TO COMMIT TO SMART GROWTH AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AROUND THAT STATION AND IF IT WERE UP TO ME. THAT SHOULD HAPPEN FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO BUT IT DIDN'T AND WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH AT THIS TIME ARE ARE ARE DOZENS OF STATIONS SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF PARKING LOTS. AND THAT'S NOT FAIR I THINK TOO. TO THE REGION THAT'S EXPERIENCING A HOUSING CONGESTION CRISIS AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO YOUR DISTRICT THAT DIDN'T RECEIVE THE TRANCE DOLLARS. SO. I HAD THOUGHT THAT IN THE BAY AREA WE OUGHT TOCONDITION FOR FUTURE FOR THE FUTURE ANY JURISDICTION THAT ONCE RECEIVED DOLLARS. HOUSE TO COMMIT BUT WE CAN'T UNRING THAT BELL AT THIS POINT BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS TO SUGGEST THAT ON BART ON LANDS WE SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB. THAN JUST BUILDING PARKING LOTS BUT I LOOK FOR DEBT HOPEFULLY WORKING WITH YOU TO MOVE. RELATED PROPOSALS LIKE THAT IN THE FUTURE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR OF QUESTION AS FAR AS OUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH OPPOSITION AND MY OFFICE DOOR AND STAFF ARE OPEN AND AVAILABLE. TO SPEAKING WITH. OPPOSITION IF AT ANY TIME THEY WOULD LIKE TO COME BY AND VISIT. AND TALK WITH US. SO WE'RE OPEN TO THAT AYE A MADAM CHAIR IF I IF I MAY I KNOW THAT. BART HAS TAKEN A NEUTRAL POSITION BUT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. IF WE COULD HAVE A BAR TODD REPRESENTATIVE COME UP AND ANSWER. AND WE FIND WE DO HAVE A BAR REPRESENTATIVE. WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JUST AND AND IF IF I'M THE I DON'T TAKE THE CHAIRS JOB IF I MAY UM AT YOUR NAME AND YOUR POSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHIANG COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M DIRECTOR NICK TO SUFFER WITH SOME THE VICE PRESIDENT OF BOUGHT. UNLIKABLE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BOTTOM DIRECTLY ELECTED. SO A. JUST AS A AS A PRESET ALL THIS WERE REALLY SHORT ON TIME SO IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR ANSWERS I'M JUST I'VE GOT A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU SO. I'VE BEEN KEEP GRAMPS WAS REALLY CONCISE I'LL KEEP MY QUESTIONS EVEN MORE CONCISE. ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. DOES THIS SET A STATEWIDE PRESIDENT OR OR SOME OF ASKED THAT QUESTION DOES A SET OF STATEWIDE PRESIDENT I DON'T THINK SO BOUGHT IS UNIQUE IN THE COUNTRY IN THAT IT'S A DIRECTLY ELECTED TRANSIT BOARD. AND WE ALSO HAVE BY FAR THE HIGHEST RIDERSHIP OF ANY RAIL AGENCY IN THE STATE SO WE THINK THAT. IN ADDITION PART IS THE SINGLE LARGEST LANDOWNERS OF PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT SITES IN THE FIVE COUNTY AREA WHICH ITS UPS. I THINK YOU KNOW BART AT AND IT'S BEEN SAID COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT PART IS ON ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC. AND. HOW WITH THAT HOW WAS THAT? THAT THAT PHRASE TO BE TAKEN. SO WHERE WOULD THE BUBBLE DIRECTORS IS DIRECTLY ELECTED SO ARE WE AT PRIMARILY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE VOTERS. AT SCHOOL ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE. AND. WE REPRESENT LOGICDISTRICTS THAN TYPICAL CITY COUNCIL IS REPRESENT DISTRICTS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE BUT IT'S SIMILAR TO A LOTTA COUNTY SUPERVISORS. NO WITH. WILL THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE DIRECTLY ELECTED IN MAY I REMIND EVERYONE THAT THIS BILL ONLY AFFECTS. AREAS WHERE THERE IS A DIRECTLY ELECTED. MEMBER ON THE BART BOARD. AND SO WITH THAT. AND I CAN SEE THIS WITH EXPERIENCE. HOW IS BART'S INTENT OR OR ABILITY TO COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IS THERE A CHANGE OR? AT THE REASON WHY I ASK THIS QUESTION ONE WHEN I WAS ON THE COUNCIL. IN MY CITY AND ALSO WAS MAYOR. THERE WASN'T A HUGE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT IN IN THE CITY THAT. THAT BART WAS GOING TO DO TO THEIR DOWNTOWN BARDS OR TO OUR DOWNTOWN BART STATION. AND. PARK WAS THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY INITIATED CONTACT WITH THE CITY CAME IN AND MET WITH THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AS WELL AS CITY STAFF. AS A MATTER OF FACT THE CITY WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAY AND EVEN ON THE STYLE OF THE LACK OF THE LIGHT STANDARDS. THEY WERE GOING TO BE INSTALLED ON BART PROPERTY. TO FIT THE SURROUNDING. DEVELOPMENT LANDSCAPE SO WHAT IS THE. WHAT'S THE INTENT OF BART AS FAR AS A ARE YOU USING THIS BILL TO TRY TO MINIMIZE LOCAL COLLABORATION OR. SO YOU YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION BOND HAS A LONG STANDING POLICY AND PRACTICE OF DEEP COLLABORATION NOT JUST WITH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES ELECTED BODIES BUT WITH COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND THAT WILL CONTINUE ROM REGARDLESS OF WHAT THIS LITTLE I'M COMES INTO EFFECT WE EVEN IT IN. IN VERY RECENTLY PUT IN PLACE A PROGRAM WHERE WE ARE INVESTING BOUGHT DOLLARS IN CITIES. AND COUNTIES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS BART STATION. AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE COLLABORATION WITH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES WITHOUT REGARD I'M AND I I DID THIS THIS WOULD WE WE WE ARE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO RIP TO RUN OVER A. A SORT OF AN EFFICIENT MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM OTHER THAN HAVING DEEP COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THANK YOU AND. IF I MAY FOR THIS. THIS SIDE SECOND A LAST QUESTION HERE IF I MAY. ARE AS FAR AS PARTS CONCERNED THAT AND I'LL LET ME GIVE SOME BACKGROUND TO THIS THIS QUESTION THE LARGEST CITY IN MY DISTRICT ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HOUSING ESTIMATES. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. THE LARGEST CITY IN MY DISTRICT HAS ONLY DEVELOPED A HUNDRED AND NINE HOMES AS FAR AS A NET INCREASE. AND THAT'S FOR. THE LARGEST CITY IN MY DISTRICT. A HUNDRED NINE HOMES AND WE'RE IN A HOUSING CRISIS AS MATTER OF FACT IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S ARENA OBLIGATIONS. THIS CITY HAS ONLY DEVELOPED A POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF ITS MARKET RATE HOUSING. TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT OF ITS LOW INCOME HOUSING POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF ITS LOW OF ITS LOW INCOME OR VERY LOW INCOME FOR TWO POINT FOUR OF ABOVE MARKET RATE HOUSING. AND SO WITH THAT CONTEXT HOW IS IT THAT THIS BILL WOULD IMPACT CITIES THAT ARE WORKING WITH BART TOT GUIDELINES. I'M SO CITIES THAT A. ALREADY MOVING FORWARD AND% THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CITIES TO SO AND I'M THE STATION THE BOTTOM LINE AND I'M A NE IN A WAY THAT BUT THAT IS SORT OF APPROPRIATE. FOR THAT LOCATION THIS WOULD NOT HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THEM BUT BOUGHT DOES I KNOW THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ACRES OF LAND IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO ITS STATIONS WHICH IS. I'M WHICH IS CURRENTLY PARKING LOTS OF MEN ON THAT LAND WE COULD BUILD AYE WE ESTIMATE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS ACCORDING TO BOX CURRENT TEO DE GUY LA GUIDELINES SEVEN THOUSAND OF WHICH WOULD BE AFFORDABLE. AS WELL AS FOUR AND A HALF MILLION SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL SPACE. AND. AND SO THIS I'M THIS BILL WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY I'M ALLOW BART I'M A COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARM TO DELIVER ON THOSE GOALS. BRECHT AND AND I I SAY THIS BUT OR EVEN ASK THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT. WE JUST NEED TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE AND TALK WE NEED TO TALK. I KNOW SITTING ON COUNCIL THAT WAS THE RHETORIC WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE HOUSE AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT GETTING MORE HOUSING. AND YET OUR POLICIES ARE ARE NOT IN ALIGNMENT WITH WHAT WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT. AND SO WE'RE FINALLY GETTING TO A POINT WHERE THE CRISIS IS SO BAD I I WAS JUST AT A COMMUNITY DID TO. COMMUNITY EVENTS THIS PAST WEEKEND AND THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS HOUSING. AND SO WITH THAT YEAH I'M MY LAST QUESTION. IF BART DOESN'T. DOESN'T HOUSING ON THESE NEW YOU MAY HAVE AN ANSWER MAY NOT HAVE AN ANSWER THIS BUT IF PART DOESN'T PUT HOUSING ON THESE PROPERTIES. THEN IS IT TRUE THAT BARK CAN PRETTY MUCH. WHATEVER FACILITY THEY WANT UP ON THESE PROPERTIES WITHOUT VERY MUCH LOCAL REVIEW AT IF ANY AT ALL. YES SIR BOND CURRENTLY HAS FULL LAND USE AUTHORITY. FOR WHAT IS TRANSPORTATION RELATED IMPROVEMENTS I'M FOR INSTANCE SO WE COULD HAVE BOUGHT COULD ON ITS OWN WITHOUT ANY. INTERFACE WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUILD A SORT OF AN EIGHT OR NINE STORY PARKING GARAGE FOR INSTANCE I'M AND. AND THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE. WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD NOT ALLOW BOX TO BUILD WHATEVER IT WANTED FROM A HOUSING PERSPECTIVE WOULD REQUIRE BOUGHT TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ESTABLISH GUIDELINES ABOUT REGARD. RIGHT OR OR POSSIBLY OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT MAINTENANCE FACILITY ARE YES THEY CAN BUILD A MULTI STORY. OI COULD BUILD YOU KNOW TRACKS THROUGH A COMMUNITY IF IF IT SO WHAT'S INTERESTING HERE IS THE THING THAT WE NEED THE MOST. AND THE BAY AREA IS HOUSING. AND THAT'S THE THING WERE STIFLING THE MOST. AND AND. SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE NEED TO. GIVE BART AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE AND WORK TOGETHER. TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT WE NEED TO MEET FOR FOR PUBLIC AND FOR CONSTITUENTS AND THAT'S HOUSING. SO WITH THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SO REMEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I THINK. CO AUTHOR GRAYSON JUST. A VERY ELOQUENTLY MADE THE CASE FOR THE BILL THIS IS A BILL THAT PROMISES INVESTMENT TO AND MIXED USE. DEVELOPMENT EXACTLY WHERE WE NEED IT I THINK I'M A CO AUTHOR ALREADY BUT IF I'M NOT. A HAPPY. LIKED. AS I AM MONTH SO MANY HERE NILES CELLS ARE CHIU IDEA. HOME OF THE MISTAKE. AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS SINCE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BART SHOWING UP TODAY SO THEY WILL HAVE QUESTIONS ARE FOR US. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. I'M MORE WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE BILLS SUBSTANCE I'M SO. PORTING OF THE BILL. AND. I SEE IT FURTHER IN OUR. GENERAL APPROACH FROM S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE DARRYL STEINBERG SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. OUR IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AS AN OFFICER OF THE LEAGUE I ACTUALLY MANAGE. S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE TWO THE LEAGUE DOES A HOUSING COMMITTEE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. I MEMBER KNOWS COMMITTEE SAYING MY COLLEAGUES IS YOU'RE STRONG WITH WHERE THEY'D BE ON CAROL STEINBERG SPILL. SINCE I ALWAYS HAVE A QUOTE. I QUOTE FROM FDR. WHICH IS STILL APPLICABLE TODAY. ONE THING IS SURE. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. WE HAVE TO DO THE BEST WE KNOW HOW AT ANY MOMENT. IF IT DOESN'T TURN OUT RIGHT WE CAN MODIFY IT AS YOU GO ALONG. YOU KNOW IN THE FACE OF PROBLEMS YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY TO BE A PROBLEM SOLVER TO THE BEST YOU CAN. I THINK IT IS SIGNIFICANT I DON'T VIEW THIS ACTUALLY IS. SEVEN A RULE HERE FOR EVERY SPECIAL DISTRICT. BECAUSE THIS IS A. TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT. THIS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES. SINCE THE SIXTIES. ARM. AND THERE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUPPORT OF THAT TRASH TRISH OF CHURCHES GONE IN. AND THIS POLICY ALIGNS WITH HOW DO WE. CAPITALIZE ON THIS PUBLIC INVESTMENT. SO I THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH OF NARAL CLASS A SPECIAL DISTRICT. OR WE HAVE APPRECIATED BY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PUBLIC INTEREST ALIGNED WITH CLEAR STATEWIDE POLICY. AND LOOKING HOW TO LEVERAGE THAT INVESTMENT TO FURTHER THAT INVESTMENT. AND I WANT TO POINT OUT ACTUALLY THE FACT THAT THIS GOES BACK TO THE SIXTIES. ARE. I ACTUALLY WANT TO MAKE THE OBSERVATION. THE FACTS WILL COME OUT IN THE WASH WILL SEE HOW THIS POLICY. WORKS OUT IN TIME. BUT IT IS A REALITY WHEN YOU HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS A BEEN LONG ESTABLISHED GOING BACK TO THE SIXTIES. AS PEOPLE AGE. FOLKS MOVE OUT OF THOSE HOMES A MOVEMENT OTHER SORTS OF HOUSING I SEE THAT IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS A. THE AVERAGE AGE EIGHT SANDIFER'S IS. OLDER THAN FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD A A COMMUNITY OF ALL. SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE AGENT WHEN THEY MOVE INTO COMMITTEE CARE FOR SAYS OTHER SORTS OF THINGS. RESTAURANTS AND OTHER THINGS ACTUALLY START TO SUFFER. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BELIEVED IN THEIR HOME DRIVING A LOCAL RESTAURANT AT NIGHT TO EAT. WE HAVE PLENTY OF RESTAURANTS THAT ARE LONG ESTABLISHED RESTAURANT EIGHT THE SENATE DISTRICT THAT HAVE CLOSED AND STRUGGLED. BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVE OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND YOU DON'T HAVE REPLACEMENT POPULATION. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THERE IS AN ASPECT OF THE BILL LIKE THIS AS A TEST BED. IT IS SOOOO GENEROUS IT IS UNIQUE CLASS OF PROPERTY. IT WILL SUPPORT A CLEARLY STATEWIDE GOAL. AND AS A STARTS TAKING THESE COMMUNITIES AND BRING IN ADDITIONAL HOUSING IN ADDITION DOLLARS JUST. ADDITIONAL DISPOSAL INCOME INTO THESE AREAS. I ACTUALLY THINK IT WILL CONFER A BROADER ECONOMIC BENEFITS SUPPORTING. SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS AND OTHER SORTS OF THINGS AT ALL WILL BENEFIT FROM. SO IN THAT SENSE I I FEEL. ON THE POLICY MERITS OF HOUSING I THINK THE CASE IS MADE. BUT IN TERMS OF SUSTAINING FAVORABLE DYNAMICS AND LONG ESTABLISHED COMMUNITIES OF THE BAY AREA. I I ACTUALLY FEEL IT IT OFFER SOME IMPORT POTENTIAL. AND. ALL OF OUR WORK ON A BE AIMING TO TRY TO RELEASE POSITIVE ENERGY. IN THE COMMITTEES WERE POLICIES WILL IMPACT I THINK. I PERSONALLY THINK ITS BROADER EVEN THAN THE CASE I HEARD HERE I THINK WILL. SUPPORT. RESTAURANTS AND OTHER SERVICES IN ESTABLISHED COMMUNITIES ALONG BARTTELOT MONTHS. AND THAT'LL BE BENEFICIAL THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS AS WELL. ANY OTHER ROOM ANYONE OTHER ROOM CLEAN MEMBERS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BOUGHT WALDRON THINKING ASSIST WONDERING WHERE PEOPLE PARK IF YOU DO THE DEVELOPMENT YOU WANTED SO PARKING WOULD STILL BE A PERMISSIBLE OPTION OF FOR A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT THE IDEAS AT THIS POINT AROUND THESE PARTS STATIONS. WE'VE HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF SIMPLE PARKING LOT THAT'S ALL WE HAVE AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS LET'S BILL HOUSING ON TOP OF THAT LET'S BUILD A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION AS. TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A PARK STATION TO BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND IS MISTER COOLEY SUGGESTED TO THE RESTAURANT TO THE CORNER STORE. TO YOUR HOME AND TO BE ABLE PARK UNDERNEATH IT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD LIKE TO DO SO WE'RE NOT PRECLUDING PARKING. MALES SHOULD BOND HAS A UP PARKING REPLACEMENT POLICY. WHICH IS SO CLOSELY LINKED TO THE DEVELOPMENT ON BOUGHT LAND THAT OVER THE PAST SINCE INCEPTION UP PRIVATE DEVELOPERS AND ACTUALLY PAID FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHAT THE BOUGHT PARKING STRUCTURE BUT. WHAT THE PARKING STRUCTURES TO BE BUILT ON THE? BOTTOM LINE AND I'M HAS. I SAID TRYING TO GOING TO DEVELOPMENT HAS TAKEN OVER THE SUB IS PARKING LOTS WE BASICALLY TAKE THAT WHAT WAS ONCE FLAT AND PUT IN A. IN A STRUCTURE IN MANY PLACES. AND ONE OTHER QUICK POINT IS THE POINT OF BUILDING HOUSING ON TOP OF. TRANSIT IS SO THAT FOLKS DON'T HAVE TO OWN CARS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN A MASSIVE EXPANSION AND POPULATION AND ALL THOSE FOLKS ARE PURCHASING CARS DRIVING IN THIS PARKING LOTS AND PARKING THEM. IF WE BUILT HUNDREDS OF UNITS ON TOP OF THAT WE COULD AVOID THAT CONGESTION AND THAT PARKING IS FOLKS JUST HOP OUT OF ROLL OUT OF BED. AND GET ON TO THE BART STATION GO TO WORK AT A HIGH COST A JOBCENTRE IN THE COME BACK. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE A SECOND HIM REGISTROS SECOND. CAIRO SECOND. OKAY SO. I WILL A. REOPEN GO AHEAD WATCHERS. WHICH ARTISTS CLOSE AND THEN I'LL GIVE ME MY STATEMENT JUROR ARE HAPPY TO HERE'S HARVEY'S LIKE WOULD YOU LIKE AND CLOSE. OKAY. COLLEAGUES VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION I THINK ABOUT A CHANCE TO MISTER GRAYSON SALAS CHANCE. TO TO MANY OF YOU JUST A FEW. POINTS AND THEN I WILL. JUST WRAP UP OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES HAD SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW THIS WAS GOING BEYOND WHERE S. B. THIRTY FIVE POINT AND I WANT TO. BE VERY CLEAR THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED AN AMENDMENT INITIALLY THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS BILL SAID THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CITY WAS MEETING ITS WIENER NUMBERS WE WANTED TO BUILD ADDITIONAL HOUSING. WE'VE AMENDED THE BILL SO THAT IF THE CITY IS HITTING ITS RAINY NUMBERS WITH REGARDS TO MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION. ANOTHER WORDS A CONTINUE TO HAVE THE PARKING LOTS OF THEY WANT SECONDLY OF. THERE'S A SUGGESTION. THAT'S THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOSTER PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND AND PART% AND THE AND THE REALITY IS. THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING THIS BEEN HAPPENING FOR MANY MANY YEARS BUT FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN TWENTY YEARS INTO CONVERSATIONS THAT PART AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HAVE A LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BUILD. HAVE NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING NEW AYE AND. THE LAST THING I WANNA SAY IS I KNOW. WE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR ABOUT OTHER AMENDMENTS WERE STILL OBVIOUSLY VERY OPEN TO THINKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL APPROACHES AND WE JUST SAW YOUR COMMITTEE NOW SINCE LAST NIGHT AND CERTAINLY THERE SOME IDEAS IN HERE THAT THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT AND LOOK FORWARD TO. ENGAGE WITH YOU IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT AT THE END THE DAY THIS IS A BILL. ABOUT ADDRESSING HOUSING CRISIS REDUCING CONGESTION IN GREENHOUSE GASES INCREASING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP JOBS ARE AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN TAKE THIS STEP WITH A NARROWLY TAILORED TRANSIT ORIENTED BILL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS WE'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS I APPRECIATE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. AYE A. WILL BE VOTING NO ON THIS MEASURES TODAY. BUT I SUPPORT THE GOALS BEHIND IN THE ATTEMPT BEHIND THE BILL BUT HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRODUCT. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING FOR ADDRESSING SOME OF THE LOWER TIER ISSUES TO ENSURE THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN DO DESIGN REVIEW. ON THE BART OWN PROPERTIES AND SPECIFY THAT THE PROJECT STREAMLINING PROVISIONS IN THE BILL ARE FOR THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT. MEETING THEIR CERTAIN RINA OBLIGATIONS I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION TRUSTS AND. I STILL HAVE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT OVERRIDING LOCAL CITY AND COUNTY LAND USE AUTHORITY GRANTED BY THE CONSTITUTION. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE PRECEDENT FOR OTHER SPECIAL DISTRICTS SIMMERED APART TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND REQUEST THE SAME TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN PARCELS I'VE HAD TO CALL ME. THE BILL'S APPROACH DOES NOT ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION A PARTNERSHIP AMONGST LOCAL AGENCIES AND DOING GOOD DEVELOPMENT. I REALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM THIS AND SO. I KNOW THAT NOT EVERYBODY AGREES WITH ME MY FRUSTRATION IS IS THAT. WE HAVE COUNCILS. THAT PUT UP THE WALL FROM US FROM DOING SOME GOOD PROJECTS I'VE HAD IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL. MY CONCERN IS I DON'T FEEL THAT AT THIS POINT THAT I CAN TAKE LOCAL CONTROL WAY. I FEEL LIKE THIS IS LOCAL CONTROL AND BART. FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOING PART AND LOCAL CONTROL SO THAT'S WHERE MY FEELING TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BILL I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS JUST BY. LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM AND I. LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WELL. SO WITH THAT SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND WE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AGUIAR CURRY. AGUIAR CURRY NO WALDRON. WALDRON NO BLOOM. BLOOM I HAVE A HERO CABALLERO AYE COOLEY. COOLEY AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE LACKEY. STONE. STONE I'VE VOEPEL. VOEPEL NO. SO HE. WENT TO. FIVE TO THREE. BOB A THREE OUT CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. WE'RE READY FOR ITEM NINE MS QUIRK SILVA. WHICH IS. A. B. TWO SIX FIVE FOUR. I THINK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DEDICATED WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION WE KNOW YOU WORK VERY HARD FOR US AND WE APPRECIATE IT. A AB TWO SIX FIVE FOUR WOULD AUTHORIZE THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND ORANGE COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT TO USE THE DESIGN BUILD PROJECT DELIVERY METHOD. FOR REGIONAL STORM WATER FACILITIES. OUR STATE CONTRACTING CODE HAS AUTHORIZED THE DESIGN BUILD METHOD FOR PROJECT DELIVERY FOR SPECIFIED PROJECTS ELIGIBLE FULL PROJECTS INCLUDE BUILDINGS WATER AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES PARKING RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND PUBLIC RAIL TRANS. TRANSIT AMONGST OTHERS HOWEVER PROJECTS SUCH AS LOCAL AND REGIONAL STORM WATER FACILITIES ARE NOT INCLUDED. THE CURRENT EXCLUSION OF STORM WATER FACILITIES PRECLUDES THE ABILITY FOR A CONTRACTOR IN A PUBLIC AGENCY TO COLLABORATE. TO COLLABORATE ON CERTAIN COMPLEX IN FROM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THROUGH THE AUTHORIZED USE OF THE DESIGN BUILD METHOD AB TWO SIX FIVE FOUR. WILL PROVIDE THE COUNTY WITH PROJECT DELIVERY AND SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS 鶂ECIALLY OF THE PENDING. STORM WATER AND FLOOD CONTROL PROJECTS SLATED TO BETTER SERVE ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. WITH ME TODAY FOR TESTIMONY WE HAVE NARDI CON WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS AND AMY JENKINS WHO IS REPRESENTING ORANGE COUNTY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ON RT CON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY FOUR WILL PROVIDE THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND THE ORANGE COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT WITH THE OPTION OF DELIVERING COMPLEX PROJECTS THROUGH A TEAM APPROACH. UTILIZING PROVEN DESIGN BUILD ADVANTAGES SUCH AS EARLY CONTRACTOR INVOLVEMENT. COST PREDICTABILITY ENHANCE SCHEDULE CONTROLS AND RISK MITIGATION. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS COUNTIES TO UTILIZE DESIGN BUILD BUILDINGS ONLY ARE RECENTLY COMPLETED ANIMAL CARE FACILITY WHICH IS A STATE OF THE ART THIRTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT STRUCTURE WAS SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED USING DESIGN BUILD. THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT FOR THE DESIGN AND GENERAL CONTRACTOR TEAM WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTY IN REAL TIME TO RESOLVE DESIGN ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION ISSUES. WHICH PRODUCE SCHEDULE AND COST SAVINGS EXISTING STATUTE DOES NOT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO UTILIZE DESIGN BUILD FOR MANY OTHER PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS SUCH AS FLOOD WATER CONTROL WHICH MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COUNTIES CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY FOUR INCLUDES ALL OF THE EXISTING PROTECTIONS ESTABLISHED BY PREVIOUS LEGISLATION. AUTHORIZING THE USE OF DESIGNED BUILT FOR FLOOD CONTROL IMPROVEMENTS HARBOR SOME BEACHES AND BIKEWAYS. AS A RESULT OF AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY FOUR THE COUNTY WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER IMPORTANT PROJECTS WITH IMPROVE PROCESS. REDUCE LITIGATION RISK AND ENHANCE COST SCHEDULE PREDICTABILITY THIS IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE COUNTY AS VOLATILE REVENUE STREAMS. EVER INCREASING CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND PUBLIC TRUST REMAIN PRIMARY CONCERN WHEN DELIVERING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY FOUR ALSO LIMITS THE NUMBER OF INSTANCES PER YEAR THAT DESIGN BUILD MAY BE UTILIZED PROVIDING A MEASURED APPROACH THAT ALLOWS ONGOING FOCUSED EVALUATION OF THE PROCESS. IN CLOSING THE DESIGN BUILD DELIVERY METHOD IS BEST UTILIZED FOR COMPLEX HIGH RISK PROJECTS WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS WERE BUDGET AND SCHEDULE CONSTRAINTS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY FOUR PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR LIMITED APPLICATION AND WILL IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTY TO DELIVER SPECIFIC PROJECTS WITH GREATER SUCCESS. COUNTY SIMPLY DESIRE THE ABILITY TO USE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE RIGHT JOB AND THIS BILL GIVES ORANGE COUNTY ANOTHER TOOL IN ITS TOOL BOX. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I WANNA A PARTICULARLY THANK STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK AND COMMITTEE STAFF AND AND HELPING US.

THE SAT SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST WATER AGENCIES IN THE STATE. MANAGING WATER SUPPLY GROUND WATER FLOOD CONTROL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. FOR A DIVERSE JURISDICTION THE SILICON VALLEY HOME TO NEARLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE. I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE WHICH AMENDS THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT ACT TO MAKE THREE IMPORTANT REFORMS. FIRST IT REFORMS A PARCEL TAX EXEMPTION PROCESS FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS BASICALLY EACH YEAR ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF SENIOR LOW INCOME TAXPAYERS FAILED TO RETURN THEIR ANNUAL INCOME VERIFICATION. FOR A LOCAL PARCEL TAX EXEMPTION DESPITE NUMEROUS NOTICES ENCOURAGED THEM ENCOURAGING THEM. TO RE VERIFY THEIR STATUS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN VERIFIED ITS LOW INCOME. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE CLARIFIES THAT THE DISTRICT NEED ONLY VERIFY LOW INCOME STATUS ONCE. AND THE TAXPAYERS ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT EXEMPTION MAY REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL THE DISTRICT IS NOTIFIED OF A CHANGE IN ELIGIBILITY. SECONDLY IT REFORMS A DISTRICT BOARD OF DIRECTORS DUTIES AND MEETING ALLOWANCE THIS BILL INCREASES THE NUMBER OF MEETING DAYS FOR WHICH A DIRECTOR IS ELIGIBLE FOR REMUNERATION. FROM UP TO TEN DAYS PER MONTH UP TO TWENTY DAYS PER MONTH REFLECTING THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF WORKING DAYS REQUIRED FOR THE POSITION. BECAUSE THE MEETING ALLOW IT IS CURRENTLY CAPTIVE TEN DAYS PER MONTH DIRECTORS MUST OFTEN WORK LONG HOURS WITHOUT REMUNERATION THIS MEANS THAT ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN REALISTICALLY SERVE ON THE BORDER EITHER RETIRED OR INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE WILL ENABLE DIRECTORS TO MORE FULLY DEDICATE THEMSELVES TO THE INCREASED NUMBER AND EXPANDING SCOPE OF THE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICE. WELL IT WILL ALSO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF DIRECTORS TO PROVIDE MORE PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF THE DISTRICT WATER SUPPLY FLOOD CONTROL GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. FOR THE NEARLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE. AND LASTLY THE BILL REFORMS DISTRICTS DISTRICT BOARD VACANCY APPOINTMENTS IT WILL ENSURE APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION BY REQUIRING THE APART APPOINTMENT TO A VACANT BIRD SEED BE MADE FROM THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRICT. IN WHICH THE VACANCY EXISTS RATHER THAN ANYWHERE FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN I WILL ENSURE APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY BASED GOVERNMENTS FOR A LARGE DISTRICT THAT MANAGES.

TWO TWO FIVE EIGHT ALSO WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST LET ME. AT. EXCEPT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE. CONSISTENT WITH A RECOMMENDATION MADE IN THE TWO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY EIGHT WOULD PROVIDE AUGHED THOSE ARE LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSIONS WITH A ONE TIME SMALL INFUSION OF GRANT LIKE MONIES TO FOCUS EFFORTS ON STREAMLINING STREAMLINING LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND IMPROVING EFFICIENCY IN SERVICE DELIVERY. THERE IS A NEED FOR LOVE GOES TO CONDUCT IN DEPTH STUDIES OF LOCAL AGENCY SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT COULD RESULT IN MORE OPTIONS FOR GREATER EFFICIENCIES. THE ELIMINATION OF NON FICTION THESE ORGANIZATIONS OR REORGANIZATION ACTIONS. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY EIGHT WOULD ESTABLISH A GRANT LIKE FUNDING PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. TO PROVIDE LAUGHED BECAUSE WITH FUNDING TO CONDUCT STUDIES AND ANALYSES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND SERVICES. FOR THE PURPOSE OF STREAMLINING THE LIVERY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. THROUGH TWENTY AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY EIGHT LAST POST WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS KNOWN SERVICE AND GOVERNANCE CONCERNS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS MONEY. GRANT FUNDS WILL BE USED SPECIFICALLY TAKEN SPECIAL TO CONDUCT SPECIAL STUDIES TO IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE GREATER EFFICIENCIES AND TO POTENTIALLY INITIALLY INITIATE ACTIONS BASED ON THE STUDIES. THAT REMOVE OR REDUCE LOCAL COSTS THAT'S INCENTIVIZING LOCAL AGENCIES TO WORK WITH A LOT GOES IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING REORGANIZATION PLANS. THE GRANT WOULD SUNSET ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE BILL ALSO CHANGES THE PROTEST THRESHOLD FOR LAUGH BECAUSE INITIATED ACTIONS SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF ACTIONS FUNDED THROUGH THE GRANT THE PROTEST THRESHOLD WOULD BE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. RATHER THAN TEN PERCENT. FOR THE NARROW SCOPE OF PURPOSES OF THIS GRANT. AND FOR THE LIMITED TIME THAT IT IS IN PLACE AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY WOULD SIMPLY MER EXISTING STATUTE FOR BOH DISILLUSIONED AND OTHER CHANGES EVERY ORGANIZATION. IF I LAUGHED COKE INITIATES ACTION OUTSIDE OF THIS GRANT PROGRAM THEY'RE SUBJECT TO THE EXISTING TEN PERCENT. WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS SUPERVISOR JOHN LEOPOLD COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ AND PAMELA MILLER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION COMMISSIONS. THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN LEOPOLD A MEMBER THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CHAIR OF THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY LOCAL. AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION AND BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LAUGH GOES. WANNA THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LIST MY TESTIMONY IN YOUR FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB TWO TWO FIVE EIGHT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CABALLERO. FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR CO AUTHORING. A OVER MY TEN YEARS ON OUR COUNTIES LAUGHTER WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL SERVICE REVIEWS OR M. SR'S. THAT HAVE POINTED TO AREAS WHERE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO GAIN EFFICIENCIES AND SERVICE. A ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS AGO WE USED ALL OF OUR SPECIAL STUDY FUNDS TO LOOK AT FIRE DISTRICTS COUNTY WIDE AT A COST OF NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ARE STUDY POINTED TO AREAS WERE CONSOLIDATION OF SERVICES ARE MERGERS MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL PICTURE IN THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF SERVICES. THAT WE HELD HEARINGS WHEN PRESENTED TO EVERY FIRE DISTRICT AND FOUND THAT NONE OF THE FIRE DISTRICT EVEN WHEN PRESENTED WITH THIS INFORMATION WERE INTERESTED IN MAKING THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO THE DISTRICT. AND OUR LAST ROUND OF MS OURS WE DID NOT INTEND TO DO A DETAILED STUDY OF EACH FIRE DISTRICT GIVEN THE RESPONSE THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED. BUT UNLIKE BEFORE ONE OF THE DISTRICT TOLD US THEY WERE READY TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THESE ISSUES. WE REACHED OUT TO THE NEIGHBORING FIRE DISTRICT AND FOUND INSERTS INTEREST THERE AS WELL. AT LEAST ONE BOARD WAS READY AND BOTH FIRE DISTRICT HAD JUST LET GO OF THEIR FIRE CHIEFS PRESENTING A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY CLEAR HURDLES THAT USUALLY STAND IN THE WAY OF THESE DISCUSSIONS. WE HAD GOOD INTEREST BUT LOW FUNDS TO CONDUCT A STUDY THAT COULD LEAD TO BETTER SERVICES AND FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR EACH OF THE FIRE DISTRICTS. A PART OF THE REASONS THAT FIRE DISTRICTS WERE INTERESTED WAS DUE TO THEIR INCREASING COST REGION OPERATIONS. ARE LOCAL LASKO HOWEVER HAD SPENT MOST OF OUR SPECIAL STUDY REVENUE LOOKING AT PARKS AND SANITATION DISTRICT SO WE FACED A CROSSROADS. IF WE HAD A GRANT PROGRAM LIKE THE ONE ENVISIONED IT AB TWO TWO FIVE EIGHT THE CHOICE WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR. THROUGH A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION WE COULD STUDY THE ISSUES OF INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE DLIVERY SALARY AND BENEFITS PARITY AND LONG TERM PERSONNEL BENEFITS. A STUDY LIKE THIS WOULD COST ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WOULD TAX THE BUDGETS OF ALL THREE AGENCIES. OF THE TOP REASONS THAT LAUGH GO DO NOT INITIATE THE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE SERVICES THE LACK OF FUNDING ALWAYS FEATURES PROMINENTLY. IN FACT FORTY SIX PERCENT OF LEFT GOES HAVE AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT A FINANCIAL IMPACT THESE KINDS OF STUDIES HAVE ON LAUGH GOES. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION RARELY RECOMMENDS FUNDING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BUT FORTUNATELY THEY SAW THAT A SMALL ONETIME INFUSION OF ONE MILLION TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDING POTENTIALLY COULD SAVE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ADDITIONAL MONEY. IF IT LEADS TO A STREAMLINED LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IMPROVED EFFICIENCY IN SERVICE DELIVERY. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE SEEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH THE SLOW DELIBERATE OF WACKO PROCESSES AND INTRODUCED BILLS THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY THE LOCAL ANALYSIS OF ISSUES. TEST IS THE CONSOLIDATION OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS TODAY I ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI TWO TWO FIVE EIGHT TO PROVIDE THE ONLY FUNDING WE WOULD GET FOR THE STATE TO CONDUCT OUR STATE MANDATED. RESPONSIBILITIES AND HELP CONDUCT THE STUDIES AND IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS THE LOCAL LEVEL. THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION WE HAVE. WE KEEP DECISIONS MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH IS THE BEST PLACE TO RESOLVE COMPLICATED ISSUES OF MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATION. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAMELA MILLER WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LAUGH BECAUSE. AND I'M A WILL TRY TO BE VERY BRIEF HERE AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. AS WELL AS THE. COMMITTEE STAFF FOUR OF THEIR VARYING PERSPECTIVES AND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR CO AUTHORING THINK YOU. THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS ALL TOO WELL A YOU'VE SEEN WAY TOO MANY OF BILLS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. THAT. BYPASS LAUGH CHO OR. DIFFER OUR AUTHORITY. AND OTHER SQUARE UNDER GROWING CRITICISM FOR NOT INITIATING ACTION TO CREATE GREATER EFFICIENCIES OR TO ADDRESS EXISTING LOCAL ISSUES. IN THE PROVISION OF DELIVERING SERVICES. BUT THERE IS ACTION BEING TAKEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WHILE THERE IS THERE'S IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT MORE CAN BE DONE. A A RECENT STUDY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE SURVEY EVER MEMBERS INDICATES THAT THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DETERMINATIONS. MADE% IN MSR IS RELATING TO A FUTURE CHANGE OF ORGANIZATION OR RE ORG. AND OF THOSE AGENCIES INITIATED ACTION TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF THE TIME AND LAUGH KOS ONLY EIGHT PERCENT. THERE ARE SEVERAL PRIMARY IMPEDIMENTS THAT LAUGH BECAUSE FACE TO TAKING ACTION. POLITICAL WILL WHICH ENCOMPASSES THE LAUGH CHO COMMISSION AND THE SERVICE PROVIDERS BOARDS ABILITIES TO MAKE THOSE DIFFICULT DECISIONS IS ONE OF THOSE IMPEDIMENTS. POLITICAL WELL ON THE LAUGH CHO PART ALSO ENCOMPASSES A LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHICH YOU'VE JUST HEARD ABOUT. AS WELL AS THE CONTRAST IN LEVEL OF PROTEST THRESHOLD. THE BILL ANALYSIS SITE SOME LAUGH CHO BUDGET DATA SUPERVISOR LEOPOLD JUSTIN AND THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE BUDGET YOUR ANNUAL BUDGET IS UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND YOU HAVE AN ANNUAL WORK PLAN YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW WITH ALL THESE. STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS TO MEET. YOUR SOURCE OF REVENUE IS VERY HIGHLY LIMITED THERE IS LITTLE TO NO ROOM TO TAKE AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT SERVICE AREAS WHERE THEY CAN UP. AND WHERE FISHING SEIZE CAN BE GAINED. SERVICE EFFICIENCIES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDE A MORE STREAMLINED AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF DELIVERING QUALITY MUNICIPAL SERVICES. AND LITTLETON NO ROOM TO TAKE ACTION. SO WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT AND THEIR RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS ONE TIME GRANT FUNDING. ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY MADE AND ONE THAT WE AGREE WITH IS TO TAKE AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT THE HUGELY DISPIRITO TEST PROVISIONS. THE LEVELS ARE ARBITRARY AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FOR A LAUGH CHO INITIATED ACTION. WHICH CAME ABOUT IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHEN LAUGH BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY GIVEN THE POWER TO INITIATE ACTION. AS I MENTIONED THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP THREE REASONS WHY LAUGH BECAUSE ACTUALLY DO NOT INITIATE ACTION. THIS BILL ALLOWS THOSE ACTIONS ONLY DURING THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND ONLY PERTAINING TO THIS PROGRAM. TO MERE EXISTING STATUTE AT IT IN TERMS OF THOSE THRESHOLDS. SOME MAY ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO RAISE THE PROTESTS THRESHOLD WITHOUT A LONG STUDY. AND THAT WE HAVE INSUFFICIENT DATA TO SUPPORT SUCH AN ACTION AT THIS TIME. BUT WE BELIEVE RAISING THE THRESHOLD TO THE SAME LEVEL AS NON LAUGH CHO INITIATED PROCESSES. PRESERVES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO PROTEST. AND THEY HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD. WE'VE HAD TWENTY FIVE YEARS TWENTY FIVE YEARS WITH THE PROTESTS LEVELS AT TEN PERCENT. TODAY WE'RE ASKING ONLY FOR A LIMITED CHANGE FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME AND ON A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF ACTIONS. AT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALL YEARLY ALREADY INDICATED IT ONLY APPLIES TO POTENTIAL ACTIONS TAKEN PURSUANT TO THIS GRANT PROGRAM. AND THIS GRANT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED FOR LEFT GOES TO ADDRESS KNOWN SERVICE AND GOVERNANCE CONCERNS IDENTIFIED IN A PREVIOUS MSR. CALLASPO EDITING GAUGING IN A BROAD LONG TERM STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATION ABOUT CLEANING UP THE ENTIRE PROTEST PROCESS. BUT FEEL THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT NOW TO MOVE FORWARD. THIS BILL IS A GOOD STEP IN PROVIDING LAUGHED BECAUSE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO DO IT THOSE LEGISLATURE HAS ASKED OF THEM. AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER MEMBER PAT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE CALIFORNIA SPEAK USE STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT ALSO FOR MY COLLEAGUE WITH URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DO WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. I'M ANTHONY CAN HELP WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION AND WE HAVE A CONCERNS POSITION. HOW FIRST OFF A WE'D ORDINARILY BE IN SUPPORT OF A MEASURE LIKE THIS? THE PORTENT WORK LAUGHTER DIES. I CLEARLY UNDERFUNDED. AND WE DO SUPPORT THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION THAT'S KIND OF THE GENESIS OF THIS MEASURE. HOW WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP? ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES. HOWEVER RESPECTFULLY AND REGRETTABLY OUR MEMBERS DON'T FEEL THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT VEHICLE TO ADD ANY NEW. PROTEST THRESHOLD. I AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY MY. A FRIEND'S A LAUGH CHO THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION ALSO RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE TAKE UP. MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE PROTEST THRESHOLDS. AND TO THAT IN OUR MEMBERS ARE REALLY EAGER TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH A STUDY. POWER BUT WE DO FEAR THAT ADDING THIS NEW THRESHOLD TIED TO THE GRANT FUNDING. WOULD JUST COMPLICATE THIS EFFORT SO. AGAIN WE WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CONTINUE LEADERSHIP. AND WITH THE FOUR TO WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS HOW BUT WE WE DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT TYING. YET ANOTHER THRESHOLD. I TO A GRANT. THANK YOU FOR HEARING ON MY CONCERNS. HIS ANY OTHER. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION YEAH I'M SO I JUST GOT. WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION A SECOND.

ADWARE CURRY. ADWARE CURRY AYE WALDRON BLOOM. BLOOM AYE CABALLERO. COME HERE I CAN COOLEY GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE LACKEY LACKEY AYE STONE VOEPEL. VOEPEL AYE. I. WAS LOOKING. THIS ACCOUNT HAS BEEN APPROVAL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER. PEN AB TWENTY SEVEN ELEVEN. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHEN WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM. MEMBERS THANK YOU. PROPERTY TAX REVENUE FOR COUNTY'S LARGEST INCOME SOURCE THAT COVERS THE COST OF THE CENTRAL. DISCRETIONARY AMENDED PROGRAMS IT IS USED TO FUND CRITICAL SERVICES LIKE PUBLIC SAFETY COURTS HEALTH CARE HOME ONCE MENTAL ILLNESS PROGRAMS. AND SOCIAL SERVICES FOR COUNTIES NEEDIEST AND MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. ORANGE COUNTY RECEIVES THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THAN ANY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. BOTH SIX CENTS TO ONE DOLLAR THIS FOR THE FOR THE FOR DISTRIBUTING LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. NORTH COUNTY WE CONTRIBUTE MORE TO RECEIVE LESS THAN ARE PURE COUNTIES. FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTY COUNTY SHARE IS TEN CENTS ALAMEDA AND STANDARD RECEIVES ABOUT TWELVE CENTS. AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY RECEIVES TWENTY ONE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. BUT ANOTHER WAY ORANGE COUNTY SENDS ABOUT NINERS HE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS MORE EACH YEAR AND FUNDING TO THE STATE RECEIVES FOREIGNERS AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN THE AVERAGE OF THE TOP FIFTEEN COUNTIES. KEEP HIM ON THE ORANGE COUNTY THE THIRD MOST POPULOUS IN THE STATE. WITH A POPULATION OF MORE THAN THREE POINT THREE MILLION RESIDENTS. WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID AB TWENTY SOME MONEY WILL BE MONIS INCREMENTAL STEP TOWARD BRING THAT PROPERTY TAX REIMBURSEMENT. OF THREE MORE PROPER LEVEL FOR ORANGE COUNTY AND. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE COUNTY TO KEEP ANY PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THAT THEY HAVE LEFT OVER FROM PAYING THE STATE. THAT MONEY WOULD STAY WITH THE COUNTY RESET THE BASE BY TAKING SLOW LONG TERM APPROACH. THIS WILL ALLOW THE COUNTY TO EVENTUALLY RAISES BASED TO TWELVE CENTS WHICH BRINGS US UP TO SAY NO TO COUNTIES AND LEVEL. WITH ME TODAY IS MARCELINO SUPERVISING DEPUTY COUNTY COUNSEL THE COUNTY OF ORANGE WILL PROVIDE SOME SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS THEY MAY HAVE. WELL I DON'T. THINK IT'S GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF MY NOSE MARK SABINO. PIE AB TWO SEVEN ONE ONE GRADUALLY CHEESE PROPERTY TAX EQUITY FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE BY. INCREASING THE COUNTY'S SHARE OF COUNTY WIDE AD VALOREM PROPERTY TAX. REVENUES OVER TIME UNTIL THE COUNTY'S SHARE REACHES TWELVE PERCENT OUR ORANGE COUNTY SHARE PROPERTY TAXES ONLY INCREASES. DURING YEARS WERE PROBABLY TAX GROWTH IS GREATER THAN THREE PERCENT SO IT'S DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THIS GRADUAL INCREASE OVER TIME. WELL ONCE A COUNTY SHARE REACHES TWELVE PERCENT THE COUNTY SHARE NO LONGER INCREASES AND WILL REMAIN CONSTANT. OF AB AB TWO SEVEN ONE ONE PROPOSES THE ADDITION OF REVENUE TAXATION CODE NINE SEVEN POINT EIGHT ZERO. AND I THINK POINT EIGHT ZERO IS ACTUALLY THE BILL THAT THERE WAS PREVIOUSLY A NINE SEVEN POINT EIGHT ZERO THAT WAS SPONSORED BY. LUKE RHEA IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND. OUR BILL IS ACTUALLY GOING TO LOOK AT IT IT'S IT'S VERY SIMILAR IN TERMS OF STRUCTURE. ARE. AB TO SET. THE PREVIOUS NINE SEVEN POINT EIGHT ZERO. EIGHT OPERATED IN THIS BILL OPERATES BY. INCREASING BY INCREASING. THE THE COUNTIES AB EIGHT ARE. INCREASINGLY KINDS PROBABLY TEXTURE BY THE COUNTY EQUITY AMOUNT AND THAT COUNTY EQUITY AMOUNT IS THEN. DECREASED FROM THE COUNTY ERA. OR. FROM THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. FIVE D. ERA OF THE AMOUNT OF THE COUNTY EQUITY NOW WE SET THAT ONE PERCENT OF ERA WHICH IS PROBABLY ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. BY THE VERY NEXT YEAR STARTS OFTEN THAT BASES ITS STATE IT IT CONTINUES AND AFTER THAT BASS THING GROWS WITH A ASSESSED PROPERTY VALUES. BUT THEN IF THE PROPERTY TAX. THE PROPERTY TAX ASSESSED VALUE RATE IS IS GREATER THAN THREE PERCENT. THEN YOU ALSO ADDED THE AMOUNT OVER THREE PERCENT TO THAT BATES. SO OVER TIME IT WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE IN AGAIN GET TO TWELVE GET TO TWELVE PERCENT. ARE YOU MIGHT ASK WHY IS A TWELVE PERCENT CHOSEN AS A BIGGER IT IS IT IS THE SAME RATE AS OF THIS AS THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO WHICH IS SIMILAR. BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS BY POPULATION. POPULATION OF OVER THREE MILLION OF PEOPLE. OF. AGAIN A. B. AB TWO SEVEN ONE ONE BY ADS ADS READY IN TEXAS COULD NINE SEVEN POINT EIGHT ZERO. OF NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MIND SEVEN POINT EIGHT ZERO. WAS. THERE WAS A BILL THAT PROVIDED PROPERTY TAX EQUITY FOR ORANGE COUNTY ARE IT WAS. REPEALED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AS PART OF THE FIX FOR. THE. FOR AS PART OF THE FIX OF THE TAKE A VLF MONIES FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHERE. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN ORANGE COUNTY FIT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS. TAKEN AWAY FROM ORANGE COUNTY BY VIRTUE OF THE PASSAGE OF SB EIGHTY NINE SO. OF THIS WHAT THIS DOES IS THAT THIS RE INTRODUCE A PROPERTY TAX EQUITY FOR ORANGE COUNTY IT DOES SO IN A GRADUAL MANNER DESIGNED TO BRING IT UP TO TWELVE PERSON. WITH THAT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WELCOME. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL IN SUPPORT THINK IF. YOU. THE OTHER WITNESSES SAYING THEN WILL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE. COMMITTEE. YES AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. THANK YOU. SO. THE THING ABOUT A FIX PROPERTY TAX BY A YEAR AND YOU'RE RELYING ON AND SORT OF AN INCREMENT OF FINANCING IS GO SOME IS A CHEN WHO'S. IF. THIS MOVES FORWARD WHO WHOSE LOSING OUT OF THE SIX BY. BOB THANK YOU SHOW FOR MY QUESTIONS SO AS WE SAID BEFORE THIS WOULD HAVE REDUCTION TO THE READ THE ROUGH HOWEVER IT WOULD BE OFFSET WITH. GENERAL FUND IN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING FURTHER ON. OKAY SETS US THAT WOULD GENERAL FUNDS BUT I NOTICED THAT THE BILL. IS IS PROTECTING SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND NOT NECESSARILY OTHER SO WHAT ABOUT BASIC EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. MITCHELL VETO IT WOULD YES A BASIC EX BASS GATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T RECEIVE ARE FOR EXAMPLE WEB WHEN YOU'RE A CITY. IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS I THINK A ONE OF IS THE ONLY BE SICK EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. THEY DON'T RECEIVE EUROPE I PURCHASE A FACT THAT THERE IS THAT THEIR BASIC QUE SO DOES SO THE TAKE. THAT THE DEDUCTION OF MONIES FROM YOU RALPH. WOULD NOT AFFECT THEM. OKAY THAT THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE WITH THIS AND I'M NOT I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THAT PROP THIRTEEN WAS IN ARTFULLY DOWN IN AND PUT IN PLACE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. WE'VE HAD THAT THEN. DO PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WHICH LEADS TO HEREAFTER THE TROUBLE FLIPS TO TO A NUMBER OF FINANCING MECHANISMS THAT HAVE HAD TO MOVE. MONEY AROUND AND THE FACT TO ME THAT ORANGE COUNTY IS ARTIFICIALLY LOW WAS REALLY BASED ON DECISIONS OF THE COUNTY. YEARS AGO AND IF WE'RE GOING TO START TO OPEN UP HOW WE FINANCE AND HOW WE MANAGE PROPERTY TAXES I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK ACROSS EQUITABLY. ACROSS THE STATE IVAN NUMBER CITY CENTER LOW WELL CITIES THAT THAT ARE ALSO STRUGGLING IN NEXT CALCULATIONS BECAUSE HE OF OF HISTORICALLY HOW IT WAS PUT TOGETHER SO I THINK WE HAVE A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN. AND. I'M NOT SURE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GO IN ONE PIECE AT A TIME AND TRY AND SOLVE. ONE COUNTIES PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE GENERAL FUND WHEN WHEN WE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW. HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK ON WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE? A BROADER WAY OF APPROACHING THIS ISSUE WITH ALL OF THE OTHER LOW WEALTH. CITIES AND. AND JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH SO I I'M REALLY LOW THEN WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL CHERRY PICKING. AWAY AT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT HERE POTENTIALLY IMPACT. DOWN THE LINE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW WE AS A STATE OR HAVE A STRATEGY ON HOW WE PROVIDE SOME EQUITY ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE WHAT PROP THIRTEEN THE WAY IT LOCKED DOWN IN THE WAY IT. WENT LOCKED DOWN THE PROPERTY TAX IN THE WAY THAT COUNTIES AND CITIES RECEIVE REVENUE THERE THERE'S TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INEQUITIES ACROSS INCLUDING IN SCHOOL FINANCING AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE AS SIMPLE AS. IT'S JUST THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE LOSER HERE I THINK POTENTIALLY IN SOME OF THE CALCULATIONS IT HAS IMPLICATIONS ON ON OTHER DISTRICTS AND I AND I THINK THIS IS. NOT AN APPROPRIATE STEP TO TAKE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS WILL COMMITTEE. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I I. WANT TO APPLAUD YOU. FOR ADDRESSING AN ISSUE THAT IS HUGE I WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING. ESPECIALLY WITH SOME SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT ARE BEING HUGELY. SHORTED. THAT NEED THE SUPPORT HOWEVER I DO SURE. SENTIMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUE MISTER STONE ON. JUST HITTING THE NAIL ON THE HEAD AND THAT THIS IS A MUCH BROADER. ISSUE THAN JUST A DISTRICT AND IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY AND. I IF YOU DO THE WORD USED THE WORD PIECEMEAL BUT FOR LACK OF ANY OTHER WORD RIGHT NOW TO JUST TRY TO DO IT ONE LITTLE. AT A TIME IS IS A BIT PROBLEMATIC. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE START TURNING TO THE GENERAL FUND TO BE THE BACKFILL. BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO SAY ALL WITH THE GENERAL FUNDS GOING TO DO THIS BUT THEN. WHEN THE GENERAL FUND TAKES AHEAD AND IT IS GOING TO TAKE A HIT. THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO. BE SHORTER BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I BELIEVE IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY DO HAVE THAT PROTECTION OF PROP NINETY EIGHT SO THERE'S GONNA BE SOMETHING. THAT'S GOING TO EXPERIENCE THAT SHORTAGE IF IT'S IF WE'RE DEPENDING ON THE GENERAL FUND TO DO THE BACKFILL SO. TODAY I I'M NOT GONNA. SAY NO ON IT BUT I AM PROBABLY NOT GONNA GO UP ON IT AS WELL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE NEED A MOTION. THE MOVE. MY MOTION IS SUCKED. I HAVE A MOTION A SECOND. VOEPEL. I WILL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY WITH WITH THE RESERVATION OF WHAT IT HAPPENS ON COMES THE FLOOR I TOO AM CONCERNED WITH THE SAME THINGS PICKED YOU SMILING AT. I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOPEFULLY FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. BECAUSE IT IS A REALLY FRUSTRATING. THINGS HAPPEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN COME UP WITH A MIRACLE BUT I WILL RESERVE MY RIGHT THAT ON THE ROUTE FOR THAT I MEAN NATIONAL FOR THEN SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATE THAT IF A MATTRESS ASSIGNMENTS OF MR SOUNDS TO GRAYSON. FROM AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S OF OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET EQUITY FOR ONE SPECIFIC COUNTY AND I CERTAINLY WILL REAP REMEMBER THAT. RESENTMENTS ABOUT BACK IN THE WITH GENERAL FUND AND SEE THERE'S A WAY WE CAN. ARMS GO AROUND ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. I'LL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES. I RESPECT ESCRIBIR GOOD DIFFICULT.

THIS A DO PASS RICARDO. YOU NEED SOME. WELCOME. GOOD. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. IN THAT TWENTY SIXTEEN I AUTHORED AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE WHICH WAS A BILL THAT EASED AND STREAMLINE THE NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BUILDING OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS ARE. GRANNY FLAT SINCE ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AND SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THAT BILL WE HAVE SEEN AN EXPLOSION OF PERMITS FOR EIGHTY IS ACROSS THE STATE. SOME CITIES ARE STILL IN THE DARK ON THE NEW RULES WERE WORKING ON THAT ISSUE OTHERS. HAVE FAT DRAG THEIR FEET AND UPDATING THEIR ORDINANCES BUT WE'RE. MAKING A DENT IN OUR HOUSING NEEDS FACTS AB TWENTY TWO NINE TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE. HAS LED TO THE PERMITTING OF MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND EIGHTY USE ACROSS THE STATE IN THE SHORT TIME THAT IT'S BEEN. IN. A. LAW NEARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE. HAVE BEEN PERMITTED IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. BUT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN. A CURRENT TO A LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER RULES ALLOW FOR BUILDINGS TO BE BUILT. IN THAT POWER LINE EASEMENT. WHICH IS THE DROP LINE OF. HIGH VOLTAGE LINES AT AT THE EDGE OF A PROPERTY. OF. AND THE A FREQUENTLY THESE POWER LINES ARE OVER UNINHABITED BUILDINGS AND THIS RESULTED IN A TREND OF GARAGES OR RECREATION ROOMS. BEING BUILT IN THESE EASEMENTS BUT NO HOUSING. OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS FOUND THAT SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN. CONVERTED TO HAVE ADULTS HABITABLE SPACE. AND THE CITY WANTS TO ENCOURAGE BOTH NEW CONSTRUCTION AND FOR OWNERS OF NON PERMITTED CONVERSIONS TO BRING THESE UNITS UP TO ALL OF OUR OTHER BUILDING CODES. TO AID IN PUBLIC SAFETY. AB TWENTY SEVENTY ONE WILL REMOVE LIABILITY RELATED TO UTILITY SYSTEMS FAILURE OR DAMAGE TO STRUCTURES. BUILT BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT ARE CONVERTED TO ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AFTER THAT SAME DAY. AB TWENTY SEVENTY ONE COULD FREE UP ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED PERMITS THAT ARE CURRENTLY STALLED DO THIS VERY SPECIFIC AND UNIQUE ISSUE CONCERNING POWER LINES AND GARAGE CAN VERSIONS. IN EXISTING HOMES IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THE BILL'S LANGUAGE DOES NOT REMOVE LIABILITY FOR NEW BUILDINGS THAT ARE BUILT IN POWER LINE EASEMENTS AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WITHOUT THIS CHANGE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ALLOW THESE UNITS TO BE CONVERTED. UNLESS PART OF THE BUILING IS REMOVED FROM THE EASEMENT AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT WOULD AT SIGNIFICANT COST TO APPLICANTS AND PROBABLY. A RESULT IN NO CONVERSIONS TO RESIDENTIAL USE IN THIS WOULD DISCOURAGE HOMEOWNERS FROM SEEKING PERMITS FOR THE EXISTING NOT PERMITTED CONVERSIONS. ARE AND WOULD RESULT IN CONTINUATION OF WHAT ARE CURRENTLY ILLEGAL STRUCTURES AND I THINK. THANK YOU AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND SYLVIA SO LEASES HERE FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND DEPARTMENT OF WATER POWER. THANK YOU WELL REPRESENTING BUT SHE'S NOT FROM THOSE. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALL BE BRIEF SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AYE WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS.

I CHOSE INTRODUCED ONE BILL WITH MULTIPLE PROPOSALS IN THE HOPE OF THE CREATING EXPEDIENT LEGISLATIVE AT A SOLUTION. THESE PROPOSALS CAME TO LIGHT AFTER LAST FALL'S DEVASTATING FIRES IN MY DISTRICT. AT THAT POINT IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THERE WAS A NEED TO UPDATE SEVERAL OF THE STATUES THAT AFFECT LOCAL AGENCIES AND HOW WE PREPARE FOR DISASTERS. MITIGATE DISASTERS AN ACCOUNT FOR DISASTERS AFTER THE FACT. THIS BILL REQUIRES LAUGH KOS IN THE LIST OF FACTORS THEY MUST CONSIDER WHEN REVIEWING A PROPOSAL TRADITIONALLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS RELEVANT TO THE AREA THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE PROPOSAL. FIRST INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SAFETY ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLANNED. AND ANY MAPS THAT IDENTIFY LAND AS A VERY HIGH FIRE HOUSE OUR SEVERITY ZONE. OR MAPS THAT IDENTIFIED LANDED TERM TO BE IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. ALLOWS HEALTH AGENCY IT HEALTH EMERGENCIES TO BE DECLARED EVERY THIRTY DAYS INSTEAD OF EVERY FOURTEEN DAYS.

UPON APPROVAL OF A TENTATIVE MAP OR A PARCEL MAP WHICH A TENTATIVE MAP WAS NOT REQUIRED FOR AN AREA LOCATED IN AN SR A OR A ZONE. ALLOWS OF THAT THE LOSS OF HOUSING UNITS DURING THE GOVERNOR DECLARED EMERGENCY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REBUILT OR REPLACE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PROCESS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SO SECOND. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON BEHALF OF THE NAPA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THERE PARTICULARLY ENAMORED WITH TWO PIECES OF THE BILL. THE FIRST BEING THE CHANGE FROM EVERY TWO WEEKS EVERY THIRTY DAYS FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE RECOVERY OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HOW TO RECONVENE JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE AND IT WAS. ON THE JUST THERE SO MUCH OTHER REAL WORK TO DO THAT THEY WERE A BIT FRUSTRATED BY THAT. THAT REQUIREMENTS OF THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN HIS. DECLARATION HE ALLOWED THAT HE WAVED IT FOR JUST THIS ONE EMERGENCY BUT THIS THIS CHANGE IN THE LAW WILL MAKE IT. BETTER FOR ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS JUST TRYING TO HELP THEIR CONSTITUENTS RECOVER IN THE FUTURE AND SECONDLY THE PIECE ABOUT THE ARENA. WITH THE NUMBER OF HOMES DESTROYED AND THE NORTH BAY THERE'S JUST NO WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO JUST EVEN REBUILD THE FOLKS HOMES THAT WERE LOST. LET ALONE MEET RENO TARGETS AND THE NEXT CYCLE AND ANYWAY THAT WOULD JUST SORT OF BE LAUGHABLE SO WE APPRECIATE THOSE TWO CHANGES BEEN INCORPORATED AND. YOU KNOW IT'S A TRAGEDY THAT THAT HAPPENED BUT WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE STEPPING UP AND MAKING IT BUT EASIER TO RECOVER IN THE FUTURE MUST PRIVATELY THINKING. THANK YOU OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OUT WE HAVE A MOTION MISSILES ARE BETTER WHEN I'M BORED OKAY. COMMITTEE COMMENTS. TIONS. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD HAVING. TO DEAL WITH THE LILAC FIRE IN MY DISTRICT. IT'S YOU KNOW AND SEVERAL TERRIBLE. TRAGEDIES FIRES IN THE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. WE LEARN EVERY TIME WE HAVE THESE EVENTS SO WHERE BUILDING UPON THAT AND MAKING IT BETTER EACH TIME SO. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND WITH THAT. CLOSING COMMENTS I SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ACT WHERE CURRY AYE AGUIAR CURRY AYE WALDRON. WALDRON AYE BLOOM. BLOOM I CABALLERO. COOLEY COOLEY AYE GRAYSON GRAYSON AYE LACKEY. LACKEY AYE STONE. STONE I'VE OF CO. VOEPEL I. BILLS OUT EIGHT ZERO. THE ITEM TO A TWENTY NINETEEN IS AND. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS I AM SURE YOU ALL RECALL LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE HELD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING ON HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS. THIS HEARING HIGHLIGHTED A NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS THAT ARE DOING GREAT WORK. I FULLY RECOGNIZE APPLAUD THESE DISTRICTS IN FULLY SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE THEIR SISTER DISTRICTS TO ADOPT THEIR BEST PRACTICES. HOWEVER OVERSIGHT HEARING ALSO HIGHLIGHTED CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRACTICES OF SOME HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS. THIS LED TO THE COMMITTEE BILL AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHT. AS REFRESHER AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHT ESTABLISHED A VERY BASIC TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHT REQUIRED HEALTHCARE JET DISTRICTS TO DO JUST A FEW SIMPLE THINGS. ADOPT AN ANNUAL BUDGET ESTABLISH AN INTERNET WEBSITE ADOPT ANNUAL POLICIES FOR GRANT FUNDING. I CONSIDERED AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY WHAT AS A STARTING POINT WAS CLEAR ABOUT THE APPROACH LAST YEAR. WE DELIBERATELY KEPT THE BILL AND ITS REQUIREMENTS NARROW HE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF TAKING SMALL STEPS IN THE STABLE SHE RUDIMENTARY TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES FOR HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS. THE WEBSITE REQUIREMENTS FOR VERY LIMITED THE ONLY PIECE OF INFORMATION HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS REQUIRED TO POST WAS CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE DISTRICT. HOWEVER WE ALSO ENCOURAGED HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS TO POST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. ALSO VERY BUSY BASIC INFORMATION INCLUDING THEIR ADOPTED BUDGETS. A LIST OF CURRENT BOARD MEMBERS INFORMATION REGARDING PUBLIC MEETINGS THAT EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES OF HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS. RECIPIENTS OF GRANT FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE DISTRICT. AUDITS IN FINANCE REPORTS THAT EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES FOR HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR GRANT POLICIES ARE ALSO LIMITED TO ONLY TWO ITEMS REQUIRED THE AWARDING OF GRANTS TO CONTAIN A LINK TO HEALTH CARE. AND THE MISSION OF THE DISTRICT. WE ALSO REQUIRED A PROCESS FOR EACH DISTRICT TO ENSURE GRANT FUNDING IS SPENT CONSISTENTLY WITH THE GRANT APPLICATION AND THE MISSION OF THE DISTRICT. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE STUFF. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS AB TWENTY NINETEEN THE BILLS ON THE WORK BEGUN LAST YEAR WITH A B.. SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WE WANT TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING. BUT WITH INCREMENTAL CHANGES. AB TWENTY NINETEEN WOULD REQUIRE RATHER THAN ALLOW HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS TO POST ON THEIR WEBSITES THE LIST OF INFORMATION WE ASK THEM TO CONSIDER LAST YEAR. BUDGETS BOARD MEMBERS FINANCE REPORTS AND SO FORTH. AB TWENTY NINETEEN ALSO REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO POST A GRANT POLICIES ONLINE. TO REITERATE ALL OF THESE ITEMS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO REFER TO PRODUCED UNDER CURRENT LAW. IN ADDITION THE BILL INCLUDES MEASURES TO MAKE IT EASY FOR DISTRICT OPPOSED AUDITS AND REPORTS ON THE OTHER AGENCIES PRODUCE A OR RECEIVE. L. BY ALLOWING A LINK TO THOSE AGENCIES WEBSITES. AB TWENTY NINETEEN ALSO FLESHES OUT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS GRANT POLICIES. IT REQUIRES THESE POLICIES TO INCLUDE. REQUIREMENTS THE GRANT RECIPIENT MUST MEET AND A PROCESS FOR PROVIDING ACCEPTING AND REVIEWING GRANT APPLICATIONS. THE DISTRICTS PLAN FOR DISTRIBUTING THE GRANT FUNDS FOR EACH FISCAL YEAR. A PROHIBITION AGAINST INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS REGARDING GRANT APPLICATIONS BETWEEN THE GRANT APPLICANT AND A DISTRICT BOARD MEMBER. OFFICER OR STAFF OUTSIDE THE DISTRICTS ESTABLISH GRANT AWARDS PROCESS. AB TWENTY NINETEEN ALL THREE CAR REQUIRES HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES ON SPECIFIC ISSUES IN THE GRANT POLICIES. AND GIVES THEM AN EXTRA YEAR TO DO THIS. BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY. THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE THE DISTRICTS CONSIDER. DELIBERATELY WHAT THE IT THEIR GUIDELINES WILL BE IN AWARDING GRANTS AND TO MAKE THOSE GUIDELINES AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. THE BILL REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO DETERMINE WHAT THEIR GUIDELINES WILL BE ON THE FOLLOWING ISSUES. AWARDING GRANTS TO UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. AWARDING GRANTS TO MULTIPLE RECIPIENTS EVALUATING THE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF GRANT APPLICANTS. CONSIDERING WHETHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE DIRECT PATIENT CARE PROGRAMS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR GRANT FUNDING. FUNDING LIMITATIONS FOR PRIOR GRANT RECIPIENTS. CONSIDERING SPONSORSHIPS OF CHARITABLE EVENTS. FUNDING OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. AWARDING GRANTS TO AND LIMITING FUNDS FOR FOUNDATIONS THAT ARE SPONSORED OR CONTROLLED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH A SEPARATE GRANT RECIPIENTS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON GRANT POLICIES BECAUSE APPROXIMATE TWENTY PERCENT OF HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS ENGAGED IN NO OTHER ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF AWARDING GRANTS. WE BELIEVE THIS GRANT POLICIES SHOULD BE ROBUST AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. WE'VE HEARD SOME CONCERNS FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS AND THE. AND THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION REGARDING SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. AND WE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM GOING FORWARD. OUR GOAL IS NOT TO UP OUR GOAL IS NOT TO OVERWHELM HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS. IT IS TO PROMPT THEM TO CONTINUE IMPROVING THEIR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY POLICIES AND PRACTICES. AB TWENTY NINETEEN ALSO REQUIRES HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS TO NOTIFY THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSIONS LEFT GOES WHEN FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY. IN RESPONSE TO THE NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE DECLARED BANKRUPTCY. FINALLY TWENTY NINETEEN REQUIRES TWENTY PERCENT SET ASIDE FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS WHEN HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS ARE. USE DESIGN BUILD AND CONSTRUCT HOUSING. WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS PROVISION WITH BEACH CITIES HELP DISTRICT AND WILL WORK WITH THEM TO ENSURE THIS PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO DEMENTIA CARE FACILITIES. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES OR OTHER HOUSING THAT INCLUDES A DIRECT HEALTH CARE COMPONENT. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION FROM WE STARTED ON AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHT. AND TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR IN THE LEGISLATURE. REGARDING THE BROAD POWERS WE HAVE GRANTED HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE AND HOW TO BEGIN ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT. OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SHARE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JIM E. WORK REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. OF THIS IS A BILL THAT PROVIDE. EASIER ACCESS TO INFORMATION FOR JOURNALISTS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. IT ALLOWS THEM TO MORE EASILY ANALYZE PRECIPITATED DATA. AND ARMED WITH THAT INFORMATION ALLOWS THEM TO MORE MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THE BILL. AND KILL OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BUT DAVID KEENE TANA WITH BEACH CITIES HEALTH DISTRICT. AS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORT IF AMENDED. BUT AS THE AUTHOR ALLUDED TO WE ARE WE'RE JUST ABOUT THERE WERE PRETTY SURE THAT ARE ISSUE WILL GO AWAY. BEFORE THE. ITEM EVEN HITS THE PREPARATIONS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAMELA MILLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LAUGHED BECAUSE. WE HAVE NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THE BILL THE MAJORITY OF THE BILL DOES NOT RELATE TO LAUGH BECAUSE HOWEVER THE ONE PROVISION. OF THIRTY TO ONE FORTY WHICH REQUIRES THE HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS TO NOTIFY LAUGH CHO WHEN THEY FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY. WE DO SUPPORT THAT PROVISION THINK YOU. OKAY A. IF OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M JEANNE HURST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS NOT IN OPPOSITION TO STICKLER FIVE BUT WITH CONCERNS. I'M THAT I'M WE'VE ALREADY SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE. I HAD THAT ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS IS FULLY COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS AND ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD TO. HELP HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE IMPROVE IN THOSE AREAS. WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THE MEASURE BUT TODAY ARE BORED I'M ASKED TO FORM A SMALL GROUP OF. MEMBERS TO WORK ON SPECIFIC. AMENDMENTS THAT WE PLAN TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF ON TO HELP US ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND HOPEFULLY WE. CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE ALL FEEL COMFORTABLE AND CAN MOVE FORWARD I'M SO WE APPRECIATE THAT CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. FUSSING THEN A COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER BONE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US THIS BILL I HAVE A SPECIFIC CONCERN ABOUT THE DESIGN BUILD PROVISION THAT REQUIRES. TWENTY PERCENT OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS TO BE AFFORDABLE I'M NOT OFFENDED. BUT IN THE LEAST BY THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS PART OF A. OF LARGER HOUSING PROJECT AND IN FACT HAVE FTA. HAD THE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING BILLS OF MY OWN. BUT I AM. CONCERNED THAT THE MANDATE OF TWENTY PERCENT. IS NOT ONE THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO PENCIL OUT AND WHAT WE'VE FOUND IN VARIOUS CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS THAT. A PERCENTAGE IN ONE COMMUNITY DOESN'T WORK AND ANOTHER. SO I I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU AS YOU HAVE DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD ON THIS BILL THAT YOU CONSIDER BUILDING IN SOME FLEXIBILITY. TO THAT INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENT. AYE SO THAT WE ACTUALLY SEE THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING THAT I THINK THAT YOU'RE ENVISIONING. BOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE TWENTY PERCENT AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PACKAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DISTANCE FLEXIBILITY SO WILL BE WILLING TO WORK ON THAT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE. OF WE NEED A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. A CLOSING COMMENTS. YEAH I JUST WANT TO COMMENT THAT YOU KNOW. AS WE WERE ALL. PLACED HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE PROMISED OVERSIGHT. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID SIDES TALK ABOUT IS LIKE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE LEGISLATION GOES GETS THROUGH IS A GOING IS BEING IMPLEMENTED. AND SO BASED ON THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE. YOU. I RESPECTFULLY GETTING AN AYE VOTE FROM ALL OF YOU TODAY THANK YOU. ON THE OTHER CHAIR HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION ON THIS. AND I'M SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL MY MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR CURRY. AYE AGUIAR CURRY AYE WALDRON. WALDRON NOT VOTING BLOOM.BLOOM AYE COVER AERO. CAVIAR AYE COOLEY. COOLEY AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE LACKEY. LACKEY KNOWS STONE. STONE I'VE VOEPEL O.. NO PALE NO. AND THE VOTE OF SIXTY TWO VILLA SOUTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER THREE A. B. TWENTY SIXTY THREE. WHAT WE'RE BACK? ONCE AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON. THE RESIDENTIAL PACE ASSESSMENTS ARE AMONG. OUR AMONG THE FASTEST GROWING TYPES OF PROPERTY SECURED FINANCING IN CALIFORNIA. WITH CUMULATIVE AT US ASSESSMENTS GROWING FROM A LEAST AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO. THEM TO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO OVER TWO POINT SIX BILLION AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE BETTER BY PROTECTING OUR CONSUMERS. RECENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT DEFAULT RATES ARE RISING AS THE PACE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO GROW DEFAULTING ON A PACE ASSESSMENT CAN LEAD TO A FOCAL PRO. FORECLOSURE. ARE A COUNTY TAX SAILED THE CAUSES PROPERTY OWNERS TO LOSE THEIR HOMES. WELL MAJOR STRIDES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO SECURE STATEWIDE OVERSIGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN BOTH SP TWO FORTY TWO. AND AB TWELVE AB FOUR LAST YEAR MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WAS HASTILY DRAFTED ON THE FINAL NIGHT OF SESSION AND CONTAINED IN NUMEROUS PROVISIONS THAT MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES AGREED THAT WOULD NEED TO BE CLEANED UP. WHEN AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WAS HEARD BY THE SAID IN THE ASSEMBLY POLICY COMMITTEES ON THE FINAL NIGHT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LEGISLATIVE YEAR. THERE IS SO MUCH CONSENSUS. THERE WAS SO MUCH CONSENSUS ON THE NEED FOR SUCH CLEAN UP THAT A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL COMMITTED TO SUCH AN EFFORT. THE LETTER SPECIFICALLY SAID. I COMMIT TO WORKING SUPPORTING ONLY TO PASS A MEASURE. ON THAT THE ISSUE OF UNDERWRITING RAISED ON PAGE TEN OF THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT A HOMEOWNERS A BUILDING TO PAY THE ASSESSMENT IS FULLY VERIFIED BEFORE SIGNING AN ASSESSMENT OR HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT. IN BEFORE WORK ON THE IMPROVEMENT ACTUALLY BEGINS. THE TIMING OF THE VERIFICATION IS CRUCIAL TO DISK TO DISK CREASING THE NUMBER OF DEFAULTS AND REDUCING THE RISK. PROPERTY OWNERS LOSING THEIR HOMES. ADDITIONALLY IT WITH THE RECENT FIRES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. HOMEOWNERS WHOSE HOMES REDUCE DESTROYED AND HAVE PACE ASSESSMENTS FOR HOME IMPROVEMENTS MAY NOT CARRY SUFFICIENT PROPERTY INSURANCE TO COVER THE FULL VALUE OF THE HOME. AND THE SUBSEQUENT IMPROVEMENT. THESE RESIDENTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO CONTINUE PAYING FOR IMPROVEMENT THAT NO LONGER EXISTS. THIS BILL AIMS TO RECTIFY THAT SITUATION BY REQUIRING PACE ADMINISTRATORS TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PROPERTY OWNER. THAT THEY SHOULD CONTACT THEIR INSURANCE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE TO COVER THEIR PROPERTY. AND THE IMPROVEMENTS AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE PROMOTES ACCOUNTABILITY. FERVENT OVERSIGHT AND RESPONSIBLE LENDING WHILE ENSURING THAT THE PACE PROGRAM AND ITS PRINCIPLES OF ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY CAN BE MAXIMIZED FOR THE YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF WITNESSES. I'VE GOTTEN IN AGAIN KAREN LAYING HERE AYE NOW GOV OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS. WE ACTUALLY COLLECT THE PEACE ASSESSMENTS TWICE A YEAR AND WE MET THEM TO THE ADMINISTRATORS OR. GENERALLY THE FIRST I NOTICED SOMETIMES THAT FOLKS HAVE THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE ENOUGH TO PAY BACK FOR THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL. AND IF YOU CAN'T PAY YOUR PROPERTY TAXES EVENTUALLY LOSE YOUR HOME SO IT'S VERY CRITICAL TO THE TREASURE TAX LIKE OURS THAT FOLKS COMPLETELY AND FULLY UNDERSTAND OBLIGATIONS. THAT THEY'RE TAKING ON BUT THE PACE ASSESSMENT AND THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD. THE LEAN SO. ALL OF LAST YEAR AND BEFORE THAT AS WELL WE'VE BEEN AYE SUPPORTING LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE BETTER UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. AND THIS BILL MOVES FAT SIGNIFICANTLY FORWARD IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART ON. PAGE SIX OF YOUR ANALYSES. THERE'S THE CART AND A HORSE THEY'RE NOT IN THE RIGHT ORDER IN CURRENT LAW. AYE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO. USE IT IT'S SECURED BY YOUR HOME YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY FOR IT IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOUR HOME. A SORT OF THE SECURITY FOR THE LEAD RIGHT NOW THAT IS IN REVERSE AND WORK COULD START ON YOUR HOME BEFORE. THE ADMINISTRATOR HAS FULLY VERIFIED YOUR ABILITY TO PAY FOR THAT WORK SO THIS BILL STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT. AND SECONDLY I GOING BACK THE WILDFIRES ABOUT EIGHTY HOMES IN CINEMA COUNTY ALONE BURN TO THE GROUND THAT HAD PIECED ASSESSMENTS ON THEN. WE DO NOT KNOW IF THEY HAD ENOUGH INSURANCE TO COVER THEIR HOME AND THEIR PEACE ASSESSMENT. THE PACE ASSESSMENT STAYS ON THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS EVEN IF IT WAS THE FIRST EVER PACE ASSESSMENT AND YOU HAD A SOLAR ARRAY WORTH FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S GOING TO STAY THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS. AND ONE THING WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT IS THE HOMEOWNERS WERE. IN MANY CASES GROSSLY UNDERINSURED JUST FOR THEIR DWELLING LET ALONG THE PEACE IMPROVEMENTS SO OF THOSE TWO SAFEGUARDS AND THE SPELL. AMONGST EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IN OUR REVIEW THEM THIS CRITICAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THEY THINK YOU. MY NAME IS TED MERMAN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION WE SUPPORT. AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE. NOT LEAST FOR ITS PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. I. TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT A HOMERS ABILITIES TO PAY THE ASSESSMENT IS REVIEWED BEFORE SHE SIGNS AND ASSESSMENT. OR HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT IS ESSENTIAL THE SAME THAT YOU DO SO BEFORE THAT THAT THE THAT ASSESSMENT HAPPENED BEFORE WORK ON THE IMPROVEMENT ACTUALLY BEGINS. I THINK. AN ABILITY TO PAY ANALYSIS REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF VALUE TO A CONSUMER UNLESS IT HAPPENS BEFORE THAT CONSUMER COMMIT YOURSELF. TO THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS COMMON SENSE IT'S STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE LENDING INDUSTRY AYE AND WE BELIEVE IN ADDITION THAT THIS ANALYSIS SHOULD BE FULLY VERIFIED AND NOT JUST LEFT UP TO THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS COULD FAITH. THE OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL REGARDING DB O. OVERSIGHT RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS AND THE METHOD OF DETERMINING AND PAYING THE. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABILITY TO PAY AN ACTUAL COST ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL. FOR THOSE REASONS MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE I CLICK SUPPORTS THE BILL IN. ASKS WHEN I VOTE. MADAM VICE CHAIR MEMBERS ACCORDING JOHNSON OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE ALSO IN SUPPORT FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THE UNDERWRITING PROVISIONS AND THE. INSURANCE PROVISIONS I'M AT THAT THE UNDER INSURANCE IS GOING TO BE A HUGE ISSUE WITH THE REBUILDING AND THAT ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT THEY NOW HAVE A PIECE. MEAN THAT THEY CAN'T PAY OFF ON WITHOUT INSURANCE IS AN HORRIFIC AND SO WE ARE I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL ON OUR DRIVE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SUZANNE MARTIN DE WITH CONSUMERS UNION ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS ROGERS I'M WITH WHITE GREEN ENERGY FIND. WHY GREEN IS ONE OF THE LARGEST RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL AND MULTI FAMILY PACE FINANCING PROVIDERS IN THE NATION? FOR CONTEXT WE'VE COMPLETED ABOUT FORTY ONE THOUSAND PROJECTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA CREATING AND SUSTAINING ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND JOBS. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PACE WE'VE BEEN AT THE TABLE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH. THIS BODY AT TO ENSURE THAT WE CREATE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THAT ARE THE STRICTEST FOR PACE FINANCING IN THE NATION. THIS GROUP HAS SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE. S. B. TWO FORTY TWO THAT AS YOU HEARD LAST YEAR ALSO A. B. EIGHTEEN EXIT BE TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR YOU'VE HELPED PASS IT RIGHT IT. AND PUT IT INTO LAW. WE HAVE MOVED FROM HAVING A LOCAL OVERSIGHT OF PACE TO NOW HAVING A REGULATORY APPARATUS THAT THE STATE BY UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. WE AS AN INDUSTRY ARE COMMITTED TO MEETING THE PRIMARY GOALS SET FORTH BY THIS BODY. NOT JUST TO ENSURE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT ACCESSIBILITY TO AFFORDABLE FINANCING THAT WILL HELP HOMEOWNERS HOME OWNERS. BE A PART OF ACHIEVING THE STATE'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE ACTION GOALS. WHAT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR TODAY IS TO CONSIDER FURTHER REFINEMENTS TO AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE THAT WILL ADDRESS NECESSARY TECHNICAL CHANGES WHILE HOLDING OFF ON SUBSTANTIVE SHIPS? AND PASTE POLICY UNTIL AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE COMPLETED IMPLEMENTING THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THEN THE RULES THAT ARE COMING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT ANY DAY. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD MOVE THE TIMING OF THE ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION. AND IF AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE WAS ENACTED AS IT'S WRITTEN PACE ADMINISTRATORS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION BEFORE THE EXECUTION OF THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT. THAT'S NOT A TECHNICAL CHANGE FOR PACE ADMINISTRATORS THAT TREATS PAYS AS A MORTGAGE PRODUCT WHICH TO THIS BODY HAS REAFFIRMED TIME AND TIME AGAIN IT IS NOT. PACE IS A UNIQUE ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF CONSUMER FINANCING. IN DELIBERATIONS LAST YEAR WE TOOK GREAT PAINS. YEAH AS A STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO DISTINGUISH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXECUTION OF THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT AT THE RECORDATION OF THE PACE ASSESSMENT. UNDER STATE LAW A CONSUMER HAS THREE DAYS WHERE THEY CAN CANCEL THE PACE ASSESSMENT AND MAY CHOOSE AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF FINANCING FROM PACE AT THAT POINT. CANCELING PACE DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE HOMEOWNER IS NOT READY TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT. IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SEPARATE INDEPENDENT. OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE COMMITTEE TO REFINE THIS BILL AND TO REJECT ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. BUT FOR NOW WE MUST PERFECT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. GOOD AFTERNOON AND CHAIRMAN AGUIAR CURRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MY NAME'S ART INTO THE ACT AND THE CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER RENOVATE AMERICA. AND AND RESPECTFULLY WE. OPPOSE AB A TWENTY SIXTY THREE UNLESS AMENDED. YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT PACE WE SPENT A LONG TIME A NUMBER OF. LOW A LOT OF TIME BEFORE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT THE VERVE REFORMS TO THE PRODUCT. AND TO THE PUBLIC POLICY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND AS YOU'VE. HAVE HEARD IN TESTIMONY TODAY THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COMMITTEE. OF CHAIRMAN AGUIAR CURRY AND OTHERS HAS RESULTED QUITE FRANKLY AND A NEW PRODUCT. PACE IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN I WAS AND EVEN JUST DAYS AGO. AND HE WAS JUST SEVENTEEN DAYS AGO IN FACT THAT THE. RICK STATUTORY REQUIREMENT PASSED LAST YEAR TO UNDERWRITE A HOMEOWNER TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. WAS PUT INTO EFFECT. AND THE THEIR PACE ADMINISTRATORS ARE. ARE HAVE SUPPORTED THESE MOVES HAVE SUPPORT OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PRODUCT. AND AND WE ARE. HEARTENED TO WORKING COLLABORATION WITH POLICY MAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS ALIKE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE PRODUCT. WE ARE CONCERNED HOWEVER WITH. THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE. AND THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY UNDERMINE PACE. AS A POLICY AND A TOOL FOR EXPANDING. ACCESS TO FINANCING FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HOMES TO SAVE ENERGY AND WATER. AND AND HARM HOMEOWNERS BY FUNDAMENTALLY ON BENDING THE UNDERWRITING REQUIREMENTS AND THAT WERE CREATED JUST MONTHS AGO THROUGH AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR. THERE WERE SOME COMMENTARY A COUPLE MINUTES AGO ABOUT A CART AND HORSE AND THE ORDER BEING AND INVERTED. I WOULD JUST. RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERWRITE SEE SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO PAY UP FRONT WHEN THEY APPLY FOR. OF FOR FINANCING WE DO THAT NOW. AND AND THAT IS THE PROCESS THAT'S IN PLACE. AND BUT WHAT AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED DOES IS IT INTERVENES AND IN THE PROCESS AND IN THE MARKETPLACE. AND I IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY. ON DOES SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE PUT FORTH IN AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR. AND AND AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE IN FRANKLY. THE MIDDLE OF TRANSFORMATION BOTH. BOTH THROUGH IMPLEMENTING THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FROM THE LAST YEAR'S. AS WELL AS. GOING THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS WITH THE DB ó. NOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIRWOMAN ON HER BELT WE SUPPORT. ROBUSTLY THE. THE GOALS OF OF FURTHER IMPROVING THIS PRODUCT AND DELIVERING IT TO THE MARKET IN THE. IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE IN DOING SO ALSO IN A WAY THAT BALANCES THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION WITH EXPANDING ACCESS TO. AND. AT AFFORDABLE FINANCING TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MANY CLIMATE POLICY GOALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IT WAS CLIFF STAYTON NAM EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF BRINGING FINANCIAL WHERE ANOTHER PACE ADMINISTRATOR. ARE ALSO OPPOSE THE BILL UNLESS AMENDED. CERTAINLY SHARE THE CHAIRMAN'S POLICY GOALS OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS BUT FEEL LIKE. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THIS BILL. HAS SOME ISSUES THAT WE HOPE TO RESOLVE AND WORKING WITH THE CHAIR THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOE LA VIE EACH YEAR ON BEHALF OF SPRUCE FINANCE WHO'S A PIECE PROVIDER ACROSS TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS. IN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO A FIFTY STATE LICENSED LENDER I'M IN OPPOSITION PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF FULL VERIFICATION OF INCOME PRIOR TO. ASSESSMENT CONTRACT EXECUTION I'M NOT CONSISTENT WITH HOW OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT FINANCE PRODUCTS WORK AND WE FEEL THAT. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THAT IT PUT SPACE AT OUR COMPETITORS COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE IN THE MARKET SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. ON THE INTENDED GOAL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MAC CLUB AND SEE NOW WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR AND STORED ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSE FOR THE. FORCED A REASONS THANK YOU. SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF OF ADVANCE ENERGY ECONOMY ALSO. REGRETTABLY IN LATE OPPOSITION THINKING. THANK YOU. US SEEING NO OTHER OPPOSITION. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS QUESTIONS. MISTER VOEPEL. I LIKE THIS BILL A LOT. IT TO HELP SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH PAYS I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE SAME COMPANIES FINANCE ANOTHER PROGRAM CALLED HERO. AND. DIDN'T SOME OF THE CITIES OF MY DISTRICT THE CITIES THAT APPROVED THE HERO PLAN. THE. CONTRACTORS WOULD GO DOOR TO DOOR OR USE MASS MAIL AND BASICALLY MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT WAS A CITY APPROVED PLAN. AND A LOT OF THE SENIOR CITIZENS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE. WOULD CALL ME UP SAY HEY WHAT'S THE STORY HERE. AND I WOULD TELL I KNOW THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE MARKETING IT THAT WAY BE VERY MUCH ON YOUR GUARD. SO THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HERO AND PACE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE. THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISS CABALLERO. ONE IS SECOND WITH WHAT TIME MR VOEPEL SAID. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BELT ON. THE. CHALLENGES THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS HAD IS. IS REALLY BEING ABLE TO. MARKET TO PEOPLE WHO REALLY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SOLD THE PRODUCT. UP OR JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND. THAT THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS WOULD PUT. THE PACE PROGRAM AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE IS. IT'S I I'M I'M SORRY BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S LAUGHABLE. NO OTHER. HOME IMPROVEMENT. PROJECT. GETS TO BE IN FIRST PLACE. AND GET THE AT INTEREST RATES THAT ARE AYE DEFAULT WOULD BRING AND SO THIS IS. THIS IS A REALLY SPECIALIZED PRIDE PROJECT THAT. REALLY PUTS. PACE PROGRAM IN FRONT OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THE HOMEOWNER WOULD BE PAYING AND SO FOR THAT REASON I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME ANALYSIS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AS TO WHETHER THAT HOMEOWNER CAN REALLY AFFORD. NOT TO ADD THIS TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY COULD RISK LOSING THEIR HOMES SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL. SPURRED. ANY OTHERCOMMITTEE MEMBERS COMMENTS SO THE. SIR MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. AS I CARE CURRY WHICH I LIKED CLOSE. I THANK YOU TODAY FOR LISTEN THE TESTIMONY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS YOU KNOW IT COMES BACK TO THE NIGHT THAT WE WERE AND THE LAST NIGHT OF THE SESSION.

WE'RE HERE TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER AND I SEE ARTICLES IN THE NEWSPAPER CONSISTENTLY OF SOMEBODY LOSING THEIR HOME BASED ON THIS FINANCING. IT CAME TO.
