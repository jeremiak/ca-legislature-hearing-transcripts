WE KNOW GIVING THEM THE CHALLENGES DURING COVERT NINETEEN IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR STUDENTS THAT'S ALWAYS IT WAS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC BEFORE BECAUSE OF IT EVEN MORE SO NOW. THE SURVEY BY CITY COMMISSION FOUND THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC OVER 70% OF STUDENTS REPORTED LOSING INCOME AND ABOUT HALF HAVE THEIR LIVING SITUATIONS CHANGE. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HALF OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IN AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF CSU AND UC STUDENTS FOR PRE REPORTED FOOD INSECURITY- TODAY WE'LL DISCUSS SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND HEAR ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE TO GIVE MORE MONEY FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS. INTO THE CALFRESH PROGRAM ALSO EFFORTS TO REFORM THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS AND ALSO A SERVE THEM WITH GREATER SUPPORT NOT JUST TUITION LOOKING UP THAT THE FULL COST OF. COLLEGE BOOKS HOUSING- TRANSPORTATION FOOD AND SO FORTH GOD WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S FINANCIALLY PROPOSALS- THEY ARE SMALL PROPOSALS THAT WILL HELP SOME STUDENTS. BUT WE WANT TO REALLY FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE AND HOPE THE GOVERNMENT AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL HELP US THINK BIGGER WE RELATE TO CAL GRANT REFORM WE KNOW THAT CAL GRANT LEAVES TOO MANY STUDENTS OUT AND WE KNOW IT'S TOO COMPLICATED. AND OUR COLLECTIVE STATE INSTITUTIONAL AIDS PROGRAMS DON'T ADDRESS STUDENTS REAL COSTS AND AGAIN WE HOPE THAT- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WILL WORK WITH WITH ME AND MR MEDINA WHO'S TAKING A LEAD AS THE CHAIR OF THE HIGHER ED COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE TO REALLY AFFECTS FINANCIAL AID- ONE NOTE OF COURSE WERE VERY- HOP TO MISS. ABOUT THE IN. PER TO RE. SCHOOLS TO HAVE STUDENTS FILL OUT THE FASTER.

WE HAVE A PHYSICALLY DISTANCE POLICY IN TODAY'S HEARING ROOM. AND WE WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS. FOR OUR DIAL IN NUMBER WE WILL GET TO THAT- LATER IN THE HEARING- BUT WITH THAT- TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL THERE'S NO VOTE SO NO NOT TAKING ROLE. WE'LL START BY HAVING. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE L. A. L. IN THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION- BEGAN ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE. WHO. CAN YOU START OVER AND- BECAUSE THEY ARE YOU CAN'T HEAR YOU. WHAT'S THE SPEAK LOUDER WHAT THE STATE BUDGET. COMING THROUGH BOTH PASSWORD CALIFORNIA ABOUT. EIGHT YOUR THAT YOU TURN OFF YOUR IN TURN ON THE COULD RESET. I STILL CAN'T HEAR YOU AND YOUR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GABRIELLE ALL OF THE POWER. YEAH OKAY GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS I'VE GOT LIKE CABIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTS AT APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE NEARLY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION IN LATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. KAGUM THE STATE'S LARGEST STUDENT FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO SERVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND PROVIDE MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE BILLION EIGHT. THIS TOTALS INCLUDED REVISED COCHRAN ESTIMATES FOR NUMBER OF NEW AND RENEWABLE STUDENTS IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IN ADDITION- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FIFTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION I'M GOING GENERAL FUND THE REST OF COCHRAN'S ELIGIBILITY FOR STUDENTS IMPACTED BY A CHANGE IN THE REGION STATUS. IT TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND WHOOTHERWISE WOULD HAVE LOST THEIR COGNATE. HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY Q. L. A. O. GOOD MORNING CAN MEMBERS THE THINKING THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. H. THREE PICKERING AGENDA PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL CONTACTS AND ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST DESCRIBED TO RESTORE ELIGIBILITY FOR STUDENTS WHO LACK YOU WANT STATE DUE TO A CHANGE IN THEIR LIVING ARRANGEMENTS. WELCOME BACK AND BRIEFLY THIS IS A NEW ISSUE THIS YEAR. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR CALTRANS STUDENTS NEED TO DEMONSTRATE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FINANCIAL NEED AND- FINANCIAL NEED IS BASED IN PART ON THE COST OF ATTENDANCE. IN GENERAL CAMPUS ASSUME THAT STUDENTS WERE LIVING AT HOME WITH FAMILY HAVE LOWER COSTS OF ATTENDANCE INSTANCE WERE LIVING ON CAMPUS. BECAUSE CAMPUS AT THIS YEAR OFFERING LARGELY REMOTELY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. MANY STUDENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE LIVED ON CAMPUS ARE INSTEAD LIVING AT HOME. AS A RESULT SOME OF THE STUDENTS LOST THEIR COGNITIVE ABILITY. ALSO ADDRESSES THIS UNINTENDED. WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO MOVE HOME TO THE PANDEMIC TO RECEIVE THE TUITION COVERAGE THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED HAD THE OTHERWISE LOOKED ON CAMPUS. AND AS THE STUDENTS ARE IMPACTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. ACTION IS WARRANTED TO RESTORE THEIR TUITION COVERAGE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING LEVEL IS BASED ON FOOTBALL ESTIMATES FROM THE SEGMENTS PARTICULARLY UC AND CSU. THANKS BEEN REVISED DOWNWARD SIGNIFICANTLY SO THE COST COULD BE SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN PROPOSED. FOR THAT REASON WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THIS PROPOSAL AS EARLY ACTION ITEM. REVISITING THE FUNDING LEVEL IN THE NEAR VISION ONE UPDATED INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON COMPACT CASE AND WEBER. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SENATE COMMISSION. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHECK FROM THERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION WHERE I SERVICE RECORDS GOVERNMENT AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS I'M ALL START MY COMMENTS THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF THIS YOU NEED COMMISSION BY THANKING GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF OUR WORK AND COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING STUDENTS AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET DESPITE THE CHALLENGES FACING THE STATE ON SO MANY FRONTS THE GOVERNOR'S DEMONSTRATED IN THIS BUDGET THE UNDERSTANDING THAT FINANCIAL AID AND OUR WORK TO KEEP COLLEGE AFFORDABLE INVITED THIS PANDEMIC IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER. ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL ON CAL GRANT A RESTORATION WE APPRECIATE THE- SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ACTION I WOULD POTENTIALLY BE STUDENTS ARE NOT FURTHER IMPACTED BY CODE NINETEEN THE COMMISSION'S REMAINED IN COMMUNICATION WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS REGARDING THIS AND OTHER ISSUES CREATED BY THE PANDEMIC AND WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD T WORKING WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT SHOULD THIS WILL BE PROVIDED TO STUDENTS WE COLLABORATE TO RESTORE THE IMPACTED STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AS WITH THE NOTED BY- LA YELLOW THERE HAS BEEN SOME CHANGE TO THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ESTIMATED TO BE IMPACTED BY THIS ISSUE OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS AND SEGMENT PARTNERS WOULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO PROVIDE THOSE ESTIMATES THEY INITIATE THE PROCESS FOR CHANGING STUDENT EXPENSE BUDGETS AND UPDATING STUDENT INFORMATION PROVIDED ON FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS BEFORE THE COMMISSION EVENTUALLY RECEIVE THOSE UPDATES AND WHAT'S CALLED OUR GRANT RECORD CHANGE FORM PROCESS- SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SEGMENTS AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE- ACCURATE AND TIMELY ESTIMATES ON THE NUMBER OF IMPACTED STUDENTS AND- COSTS ASSOCIATED. OKAY THANK AND THIS IS AND I AN ITEM. THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO TAKE ACTION NOT TODAY BUT THE NEAR FUTURE AND EARLY ACTION ITEM. RELATED TO CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY FOR NO ACTION TODAY DO WE AND I DO THINK THIS MAKES SENSE AS THE L. A. UNNOTICED. SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL ADDRESSES IN YOUR FUTURE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR MEDINA. YEAH I HEARD ALL THE PRESENTERS SAY THAT ALL WE HAVE IS ESTIMATES. ON HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE IMPACTED SO. MY QUESTION PERHAPS TO ALL. OUR WHAT IS THE DATA TRACKING METHODS THAT ARE USED BY UC CSU. AND C. SACK. TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IMPACTED. SO WHAT METHODS ARE USED TO TRACK THE DATA. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND I COULD SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE HOW THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS TRACKING THIS DATA- AS I MENTIONED WE RECEIVE UPDATES FROM OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS- TO. OBVIOUSLY GRAB RECORD CHANGE FORMS ARE WHAT'S CALLED R. G. TWENTY ONE FORM IN WHICH I CAMPUS FINANCIAL AID OFFICE INFORMS THE STUDENT THAT THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE TO THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED BUT- THE OTHER FASTER. OR THEIR- DREAM ACT- SO THIS PROCESS IS INITIATED AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL FIRST- BEFORE WE ULTIMATELY RECEIVE ABOUT SUBISSION AS- G. TWENTY ONE FORM. AND THAT'S THE DATA THAT WE CAN UTILIZE THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION- I'M TO ASSESS HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE BEING SHIFTED INTO ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL AID. FOR IN CASE HOW MANY STUDENTS AT A CHANGE SUCH THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL AID BASED ON- STATUTE. AND SO ARE OUR STATEMENT PARTNERS- FROM MY UNDERSTANDING ARE RECEIVING UPDATES FROM THEIR CAMPUS FINANCIAL AID OFFICES- AND REPORTING TO US BASED ON WHAT THEY'RE HEARING FROM CAMPUSES. BUT FOR THE COMMISSION WE'RE TRACKING THIS VEHICLES. GRANT RECORD CHANGE FORMS THAT ARE SUBMITTED. IT IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT. THE METHODS USED AT UC AND CSU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA I THINK THAT THE OTHER SEGMENTS COULD COULD BEST PROVIDE YOU THAT UPDATE BUT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S A PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR CAMPUS FINANCIAL AID PROCESS THE PRODUCT CAMPUS BENTLEY OFFICES% AND BY WHICH THE SEGMENTS ARE UNDERSTANDING HOW THOSE CAMPUSES ARE ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY IMPACTED STUDENTS AND THEN TAKING THAT A LITTLE FOR THE SYSTEM- AND PROVIDING THAT TO A TO THE COMMISSION AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT- WE HAVE A SOMEWHAT LAGGING INDICATOR ON THIS METRIC BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WITH THE COMMISSION. WAIT FOR THIS GRANT RECORD CHANGE FORMS TO BE SUBMITTED TO US. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE SEGMENTS HERE TODAY. CORRECT DO WE DO WE HAVE CSU AND WE GOT OUT OF NOW ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. I FOR THE QUESTIONS AN ITEM NUMBER ONE. MISTER CHAIRMAN CRESSMAN MISTER DONALD AND IT THIS IS PRETTY COMPLEX THERE'S A LOT OF ACRONYMS HERE A LOT OF PROGRAMS MY SON ONE OF THE REPORTS THAT. SOME PEOPLE THINK WE NEED TO SIMPLIFY THIS AS A PARENT OF ONE IS HEADING INTO COLLEGE I THINK THAT'S- PROBABLY A GOOD THING- BECAUSE EVEN SITTING HERE I GET. CONFUSED ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND GEE IF I WERE. A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO MY COUNSELOR WOULD MOST LIKELY HELP ME BUT EVEN THEN I'M SURE CANCERS GET CONFUSED. SO I HAVE A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHO PERTAINS TO THE TOPIC ONE NOW THAT'S OKAY AND THAT IS THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS A PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IT IS THAT. ON LEGISLATIVE SIDERS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL NO THERE'S NO PROPOSAL IN THE- GOVERNORS BUDGET AND- OUT THIS FAR AS THE CAL GRANT REFORM. THAT MR MEDINA AND OTHERS KNOW- ALTERATION I WANNA DROP IT WHICH IS ACTUALLY GETTING RID OF YEAH I KNOW AND SO. ARE PROPOSAL JUST YOU KNOW NOT DEBATING TODAY WE DO NOT GET RID OF THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP EITHER PUT. YOU OKAY THIS. BUT THERE'S NO PROPOSAL YOU WANT TO DROP IT APPARENTLY WHICH TO ME IS GETTING RID OF IT BUT EITHER WAY NO I DON'T NOT. WHAT THE TOPIC AT HAND THE ONLY JUST BE STRAIGHT. THIS NOT DEBATING TODAY BUT OUR PROPOSAL WHICH IS A BILL DOES NOT DROP IT NOR GET RID OF IT. OKAY WE LOOK AT JUST SOME OF THE INCOME LIMITS. THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE I'M COMING FOR THE UPPER UPPER IN BLACK PEOPLE MAKE UP UP TO LIKE TWO HUNDRED GRAND- AND THEN. WE RE DIRECT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BUT THAT'S NOT PROPOSAL BEING THAT BEING DISCUSSED TODAY THE GOVERNOR'S RACE ONE OF OKAY OF THAT PLAN THAT REALLY WAS MY QUESTION. YEP WHEN IT DOES COME UP THOUGH YOU CAN. BE SURE YOU. WILL HEAR FROM ME BECAUSE I THINK. WE NEED HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS IN CALIFORNIA TOO. IN A LOWER INCOME FOLKS. NEED HELP FOR SURE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS IN. EVIDENCE TODAY IT'S RIGHT HERE. THEY WERE HELPFUL AND GETS KIDS THAT WENT TO MY HIGH SCHOOL THAT I TAUGHT IN. THE WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS TO. AN OLD DISCUSS THAT WHEN THE TOPIC COMES WERE. THEY GONNA. OKAY FOR THE QUEST OF THE ISSUE ONE. SWIMMER VITAS. EVERYONE IS MEMBER HOLD ON THAT WOULD HAVE TO IN THE MIDDLE PROSPERITY AT THE POLICE THAT SIX BY THE- I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT PROGRAM B. OR C. WILL IS THERE POTENTIAL THAT. THAT STUDENTS WILL ALSO BE FELT ABILITY DO YOU LIKE CHIANG HOUSING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. THE PART OF FINANCE ONE OF. THAT. KAMALA CHAMBERS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- DURING THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY THANK YOU SEE CSU NCCC INDICATED THAT KALRA NAY WEST OF IT- A COUPLE THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH IT LEAVING STATUS CHANGED HOWEVER THE SEGMENTS DID NOT MENTIONED REGARDING CALL GRAHAM B. OR C. I CAN GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE- WE CAN COOK- CONTACT THE SECONDS. THANK YOU. FURTHER QUESTIONS ON MR GALLAGHER. I THINK THE QUESTION YEAH- IF YOU NEED. THAT THE FINANCIAL NEWS PER SE. EVEN THOUGH THE SITUATION MIGHT HAVE OKAY- WHAT'S REALLY THE BASIS FOR THAT BECAUSE I MEAN AS ALWAYS I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE DO HAVE. WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES- AND WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS ALL THE LEGITIMATE NEEDS THAT EVERYBODY HAS- AND THERE'S AND THERE CERTAINLY ARE A LOT OF THEM. BUT SORT OF ASSUMING THAT WITHOUT REALLY. AND IN THIS BUDGET. I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK WHAT KIND OF THE BASIS FOR THAT AND HOW DO WE DETERMINE THAT. THAT FINANCIAL NEED IS STILL THE SAME EVEN THOUGH SOMEONE'S. MAY NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR HOUSING FOR INSTANCE- SO MAYBE IF SOMEBODY COULD JUST RESPOND TO THAT. SORRY THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION BRIANNA BRANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER TO THE CHANGING LIVING STATUS WE SEE IS A REALLY TECHNICAL ISSUE HERE- THE STUDENTS WHO ARE LOSING THEIR ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE- WHATEVER OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR AN AWARD AND WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. TO STAY LIVING ON CAMPUS- BUT DUE TO THAT YOU KNOW UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMPANY TEAM THEY'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO DO SO YOU KNOW FROM THE MINISTRATIONS PERSPECTIVE THIS IS REALLY JUST A TECHNICAL. ISSUE TO RESTORE ELIGIBILITY. YEAH I WILL NOT SAY THAT THE MAJORITY OF CALVIN AND I'VE CRACKED IF I'M MISTAKEN CAL GRANT EIGHT. IS COVERS TUITION ANYWAY SO IT'S NOT YOUR YOUR HOUSING COSTS SO I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENCE WITHOUT A DISTINCTION. OKAY SO LET'S GET INTO THE MEAT OF THE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SO LET'S CONTINUE NOW WITH THE OTHER. ISSUES NOW ISSUE TOO. THE PROPOSAL CHANGING FOR NON PROFITS- ISSUE THREE THE INCREASE. IN COMPETITIVE. GRANTS ISSUE FOR THE NEW ACTRESS AWARD FOR FOSTER YOUTH SO. LET'S PROCEED WITH ISSUE. WITH THOSE ISSUES. BERMAN A FINANCE. CORRECT WITH THE COMING OF FINANCE. FOR A YEAR CONGRESS FOR NON. AS IN IN THE AGENDA OUR CURRENT LAW REQUIRES% PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER ADMISSION TO AT LEAST THREE THOUSAND. IT'S A GREAT TRANSFERRED. BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AT THE MAXIMUM AGR IN TUITION AWARD FOR STUDENTS ATTENDED A PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTION. EVERY SEED. NINE THOUSAND EIGHT FOUR DOLLARS ASSET FOR CARBON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO AMEND THE STATUTE. THE LATEST REQUIREMENT FROM APPLYING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TWELVE POINT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THIS REPORT WILL PROVIDE INSTABILITY TO STUDENTS WHO ARE CONTEMPLATING ATTENDING A PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT PRIVATE INSTITUTION. AND THOSE CONTINUE AND THEIR EDUCATION. IS THE KING OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. PRIVATE NONPROFIT UNIVERSITIES HAVE EXPERIENCE IN A MOMENT DECLINES DURING THE PANDEMIC I WAS SCARED AND INOTES IN PAGE FIVE YEAH I SEE A MEMBERS HAVE REPORTED A MEDIAN DECLINE OF ABOUT 7% FROM. TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. AND I DID THESE TRENDS THERE IS THE REST OF THE SECTOR COULD MESSAGE EDT ADMISSIONS TRGET IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR. BUT COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION AND CAL GRANT COVERAGE FOR INCOMING STUDENTS IN THE BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD PREVENT THIS POTENTIAL REDUCTION AWARD AMOUNTS FOR INCOMING STUDENTS OF FINANCIAL AID. I THINK NEARLY ACTION THE PROPOSAL. AS CHáVEZ NOTED. BUT PROVIDE THE STUDENTS MORE PREDICTABILITY REGARDING THE FINANCIALLY COVERAGE AS THE MAKING MORE DECISIONS THIS SPRING. PLEASE REFERENCE THE RECOMMENDED OPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THANK YOU. OKAY L. A. O. THAT WAS SELLING AT ONE. SENATE COMMISSION. J. PARTNER ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION THE COMMISSION WOULD AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS YOU'VE HEARD FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALEJO WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL TO OUR STUDENTS TO SEE ANY DISRUPTION TO THEIR ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID DURING THE PANDEMIC AND A PERIOD OF SUCH UNCERTAINTY FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. OKAY SO BEFORE WE GET ON TO THE TO THE COMPETITIVE HOWEVER IF HE'S REALLY GOT- IS EXPECTED TO HAPPEN. JUST SOME OF THE ICC YOU THE TOP OKAY YEAH WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE INDEPENDENT CALLED UNIVERSE. OUR GREAT. SURE IN THE MORNING ALEX GREAT THAT THEY ARE CEO I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS THIS ITEM AND HAVE NOT PROFIT SECTORS ARE TO TRANSFER FOR STUDENTS WE SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL PUSH OUT THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS THIS YEAR GIVEN THE HISTORIC DISTRACTIONS WE'VE SEEN OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FOR INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE. OF THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION IN YOUR AGENDA GETS A GOOD SYNOPSIS OF THE ISSUE- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT SINCE THAT AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE ACC INSTITUTIONS HAVE ARTICULATED TO AT LEAST ONE EIGHTY PATHWAY SO THIS MEANS THAT THE MAJORITY AT FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE EXCEPT AT T. ARE PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES. AS OF LAST ACT YEAR WE NOW. FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN ARTICULATED AT T. PATHWAYS AND THREE ARE INSTITUTIONS HAVE ARTICULATED TO EACH AB T. PATHWAY. I'M IS YOUR ITEM NOTES LAST YEAR OVER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY STUDENTS WERE ADMITTED TO A PARTICIPATING INSTITUTION EXCEEDING. OUR STATUTORY TARGET TWO THOUSAND. AT THIS PAST NOVEMBER WE SURVEYED OUR ADMISSIONS OFFICE SAID IT IS. WITH FIFTY SIX INSTITUTE RESPONDING TO COLLECTIVELY ENROLL ABOUT 91% OF OUR UNDERGRADUATES. THOSE SURVEY FINDINGS REVEALED A 7% DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT OVERALL AND A 6% DECLINE IN TRANSFER STUDENTS. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE ALSO LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT THE RESPONSES OF AT T. PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS. AND FOUND THAT THE DECLINE FOR THEIR TRANSFER STUDENT ROMAN WAS ABOUT SIX AND A HALF PERCENT- SO WELL WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE DATA COLLECTION. AND ANALYSIS PROCESS FOR THIS ACADEMIC YEAR'S AT T. ADMIT NUMBERS. OUR SURVEY FINDINGS CERTAINLY LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT THE PANDEMIC MAGGIE ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR EIGHTEEN NUMBERS THIS YEAR. WE NOW BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE SECTOR'S COMMITMENT AT T. STUDENTS SEEKING TO TRANSFER. SO AGAIN IT'S SUPPORT ADMINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THAT COMMITMENT REMAINS. WHILE ALSO PROVIDING EARLY INSURANCE TO STUDENTS AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL AID OFFICES WERE PACKAGING EIGHT. BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN STUDENTS HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THIS SPRING. THANK YOU BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE RELATES TO OUR NONPROFIT COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VITAS. THANK YOU SO THIS PANDEMIC THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING ON ELEVEN MONTHS ALMOST A YEAR OF DESTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS THAT AT EVERY LEVEL- THERE'S NOT FOR VARIOUS INDUSTRIES IN SCHOOLS IS NOT REALLY CLEAR PATH FOR RE OPENING A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS LIVES CALLED STUDENTS LIVES HAVE BEEN UP ROOTED AND THERE'S NO CLARITY OR PATH BECAUSE WE'RE STILL KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC I'M EVEN CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE. VACCINATIONS THAT ARE BECOMING MORE MORE READILY AVAILABLE WHILE WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT INCREASE BUT WOULDN'T IT BE OR WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER A TWO YEAR EXTENSION OF AT T. GOALS THIS WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS IN THE SEGMENTS TO MORE TIME TO RECOVER FROM THE IMPACTS OF COAL BED AND GET BACK ON TRACK WITH THEIR EDUCATION IS THIS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE OPEN TO. HI ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT SPECIFIC ORDER- THIS YEAR. AS A RESULT THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. HOWEVER I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR FEEDBACK TO THE ADMINISTRATION. YEAH I MEAN WE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW HOW LONG THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE SO I THINK AS WERE STARTING TO APPROACH THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER BECAUSE- YOU KNOW EIGHT IT'S A YEAR LATER IT'S GOING TO TAKE US SOME TIME TO RECOVER AND STUDENTS AND WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED OF THAT BUT- THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER REST THANK. YOU FOR THE SURVEY OF. DEFENSE EARLIER BY THE INDEPENDENT. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SHOWS THE SURVEY BY THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES UNIVERSITY SHOWS THAT COMMUNITY CALL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IT IS ALTHOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT FORUM BUT STILL HAVE QUESTIONS WHAT ARE THE FACTORS. THAT YOU BELIEVE ARE INVOLVED AND DRIVING THIS DECLINE AND HOW IS THAT GOING. FIRST OF THESE. I'M SORRY WAS THAT QUESTION FOR ME ASSEMBLY MEMBER I YES IT'S HARD TO GET OKAY DIRECTED TO THE ASSOCIATION CORRECT THANK YOU BODIES UP TO GIVE HIM I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- YOU KNOW I THINK. I THINK YOUR QUESTION AS WELL THE POINT MADE BY YOUR CALL LIKE PREVIOUSLY ABOUT- ONE ZERO THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH I MEAN CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW D. E. SHAW IMPACTS THE PANDEMIC ARE STILL NOT. ENTIRELY RELIES- AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THIS PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT NOT JUST- YOU KNOW THIS YEAR'S CLASS BUT IT ALSO IMPACTS THE BROADER PIPELINE RIGHT OF STUDENTS COMING INTO AB OR OR TWO YEAR AND FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES- YOU KNOW I. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING A FOLLOW UP SURVEY- TO SEE HOW IT MISSION MEMBERS ARE LOOKING FOR. THIS COMING YEAR- AND CERTAINLY WITH YOU KNOW VACCINE ROLL OUT IN OTHER THINGS THAT OCCURRING- YEAH WE CAN HAVE SOME OPTIMISM THAT PERHAPS THAT ENROLLMENT WILL WILL STABILIZE BUT AT I JUST DESTRUCTION LAST YEAR WAS WAS MASSIVE NOT JUST FOR NEW INCOMING STUDENTS WERE TRANSFER STUDENTS BUT THERE WAS ALSO. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN OFTENTIMES UNPRECEDENTED- SUMMER MELT WHERE STUDENTS YOU KNOW BETWEEN THE TIME THEY DECIDED WE'RE GONNA GO- IN THE SPRING WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO JUMP FONG- CHANGE THEIR MIND SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT STILL TO BE DETERMINED THAT IS TO YOU HOW. THIS WILL PLAY OUT IN THE LONGER TERM. AND JUST AS A QUICK FOR UP ON AGREE WITH THE MY- MEDINA. IN THE COLLECTION OF THIS DATA. IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US MAYBE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AS IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING EARLY ACTION. TO TRY TO TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUES BUT FOR THE FUTURE IT WILL BE IMPORTANT AS WE MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS. SO I WANT TO ECHO WHAT MY- MY COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT- BUT COLLECTING THIS DATA. THANK YOU AT AND I THINK OVERALLTHAT HIS POLICY WAS BORN OUT OF OUR DESIRE TO. INCREASE TRANSFER OPPORTUNITIES. WHICH WE HAD BEEN DOING AT THE UC AND CSU. AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES THE UC AND WE WANTED TO WITH OUR INVESTMENT THAT WE MAKE FOR INDEPENDENT CALLS UNIVERSITIES WOULD SAY NOW. WE KNOW THERE A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TO MAKE SURE WE GET ENOUGH. STUDENTS EDUCATED WITH A HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT THAT. THAT INVESTMENT TO HELP. A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFERRED OPPORTUNITY SO BUT WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC AND I THINK THIS PROPOSAL HAS MERIT- WE WILL DELAY ACTION ON THIS- FOR THE TIME BEING SEEN FOR THE QUESTIONS ON. THIS ISSUE WILL PROCEED NOW WITH THE NEXT ISSUE. RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS. THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS SUPPORT FINANCIAL AID AWARDS. WHAT IS. ADMINISTRATIVE FINANCE. BUT DID NOT MEET ALL THE CRITERIA TO RECEIVE AN ENTITLEMENT A WORK. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE MILLION I'M GOING GENERAL FUND. TO LACK NINE THOUSAND COVERING COMPLETED ABOUT WHAT'S THIS WILL INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS. TWO THOUSAND. OKAY NEXT L. L. THANK YOU THE TABLE IN THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SEVEN IF YOU'RE CARRYING A GUN THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. FROM THIS TABLE THE DEMAND FOR COMPETITIVE OR ITS FAR EXCEEDS SUPPLY. WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE NOT RECEIVING A LARGE. FOR THE DATA FROM THESE ACCIDENTS THAT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING AWARDS HAVE HIGH FINANCIAL NEED. WITH AN AVERAGE INCOME OF ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. BUT ALSO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF THESE AVAILABLE WHERE IT'S- AN EXPECT ALSO THAT THE AWARDS TO BE ALLOCATED A LARGE PART ACCORDING TO STEPHEN. THIS IS BECAUSE THE SCORING MATRIX THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION USES TO PRIORITIZE COMPATIBLE WHAT RECIPIENTS PLACES THE GREATEST WEIGHT ON MEASURES SUCH AS HOUSEHOLD INCOME THAN EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION. DOES THREE IS ONE IMPORTANT FISCAL CONSIDERATION WHICH IS THAT THE COST OF EXPANDING KIND OF WORDS TO INCREASE NOTABLY IN THE OUT YEARS. THIS IS A PATTERN WE COMMONLY SEE WITH BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ONE NEW COALPART OF CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT A TIME. IT'S AN EXTENSIVE. NEED THE COSTS OF THIS PROPOSAL COULD ROUGHLY DOUBLE BY THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY FIRST LEGISLATURE TO KEEP THE STATE'S PROJECTED OPERATING DEFICIT IN MIND AS IT CONSIDERS ANYHOW CAN EXPANSION BUT PARTICULARLY ONES LIKE THIS THAT HAVE ESCALATING COSTS. THAT SAID IF THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE WE DO THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS WORTH CONSIDERING. I KNOW THAT IT ALIGNS CLOSELY WITH RECENT LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO EXPAND HOW CAN ELIGIBILITY ACCORDING TO STUDENT NEED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATE COMMISSION. MCCARTY A TAPE RUNNER UP AFTER THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT GOVERNOR NUISANCE PROPOSED AN EXPANSION OF THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT WORDS AVAILABLE FOR THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR THIS WILL ALLOW US THAT THE COMMISSION TO SERVE MORE OF THE ELIGIBLE BUT UNFUNDED STUDENTS THAT WERE JUST REFERENCE BY L. A. L. AS A NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED NINETY THREE THOUSAND APPLICANTS REFERRED TO THE ONLY FORTY ONE THOUSAND AWARDS OF THE COMMISSION WAS AUTHORIZED TO PAY JUST STUDENTS SO AFTER THE LARGEST INCREASE IN THE HISTORY OF THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS ENACTED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN STATE BUDGET ONLY ONE FOR EVERY SEVEN STUDENTS IN THE COMPETITIVE POOL RECEIVE THE GRANT OR PUT ANOTHER WAY 86% OF STUDENTS AND A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM DESPITE HAVING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL. NEED WILL NOT RECEIVE A CALTRAIN WORK. WHAT THE COMMISSION IS. FOR THIS PROPOSED AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE ADDED INVESTMENT- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS WOULD STILL LEAVE. MANY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WITHOUT EIGHT NOR WOULD IT PROVIDE ANY PREDICTABILITY FOR CERTAINTY TO THE STUDENTS WHO MIGHT EVENTUALLY. RECEIVE AN AWARD. SO THAT NINE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE AWARDS ARE CERTAINLY A WELCOME INVESTMENT IN THE PROPOSED. TWENTY TWENTY IN THE PROS TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO STATE BUDGET- BUT AS YOU NOTED EARLIER- YOUR COMMENTS JOHN MCCARTY. WE DO HOPE THAT MOVING FORWARD UNDER CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION WE CAN ELIMINATE THE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS THAT RESULT IN ANY GIVEN IN PLACE. IN THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND PROVIDER MOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH MORE PREDICTABLE ACCESS. TO STATE FINANCIAL AID. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY I WANT TO START TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE- FIRST OF ALL THIS IS IT'S A IT'S A PLUS THAT WE'RE DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE CAL GRANT COMPETITIVE AWARDS BY NINE THOUSAND AND AS YOU SAID LAST YEAR- LAST YEAR WAS THE BIGGEST INCREASE SO. YOU KNOW FIVE TEN YEARS AGO YOUR ODDS OF GETTING AT COMPETITIVE WARD I THINK LIKE ONE AND FIFTEEN NOW WITH THIS THERE WOULD BE ONE AND FIVE SO THAT'S A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT. BUT I THINK THE BIG PICTURE IS THAT WE HAVE THESE- CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH YOU KNOW REWARDS INDIVIDUALS TO FILL OUT THE FACT THAT WHEN THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT THEN IF YOU LET'S SAY DURING THIS PANDEMIC IT SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO TO SCHOOL FOR A YEAR YOU'RE GOING TO WORK HELP YOUR FAMILY. YOU'RE STILL A GREAT STUDENT AND THEN YOU APPLY FOR THE CARAVAN A COUPLE YEARS LATER AND YOUR YOUR YOUR ELIGIBILITY IF YOUR INCOME IS HASN'T CHANGED THEIR GRADES WERE THE SAME AS IN HIGH SCHOOL THEN YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE IN THIS COMPETITIVE POT AND SO IT'S NO LONGER AN ENTITLEMENT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO IN THIS COMPETITIVE POTTON COME AND COMPETE WITH. YOU KNOW TENS OF THOUSANDS IN YOUR ODDS OF GETTING OUT ARE ONE IN FIVE AND SO- THERE'S NOTHING CHANGE WITH THAT STUDENT THERE'S STILL A QUALIFIED STUDENTS ARE STILL READY TO LEARN BUT WE JUST TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY AND SO THIS IS ONE OF- I THINK THE MISTAKES WHEN WITH THE CAL GRANT- PROGRAM WHEN WE CREATED IT ABOUT TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO. SO WHAT WE WOULD WE WOULD HELP AND I KNOW THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN TO LOOK AT MODERNIZING AND ELIMINATING BARRIERS AND SIMPLIFYING- ELIGIBILITY- AS AS- AS MR O'DONNELL SAID AND WE THINK IT'S EASY YOU JUST HAVE TO DO ONE THING FILL OUT THE FORM AND THE STATE WILL TELL YOU WHICH ONE YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR GRANT THERE'S TWO FORMS IF YOU'RE- A DOCUMENT IN CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IT'S THE CHANCE TO. TO MAKE THIS EASIER AND TAKE CARE MORE STUDENTS NOT THE OPPOSITE BUT ALL THIS COSTS MONEY AND THE GOOD NEWS OF THIS DOES PUT IN THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS MORE. INTO FINANCIALLY IN CALIFORNIA PLUS WE'VE GOT A PROPOSAL SO THAT IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION CERTAINLY WE COULD ALWAYS ATTEMPTED. TO TAKE TO GO MORE- YOU KNOW- WILL GET THAT BITES. IS CERTAINLY. GET STRONG SUPPORTER THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITY OF A BILL OF THE ASSEMBLY TO INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE AWARDS- BUT AGAIN I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS IN A LARGER CONTEXT MR MEDINA. ALL RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR- IT IS SO COMPLICATED AS MR O'DONNELL SAID AND THAT SEEMS LIKE THE CHANCES OF GETTING ONE OF THESE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS ARE SMALLER THAN THAN WINNING THE LOTTERY AND SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH YOU TO SIMPLIFY- THE WHOLE SYSTEM. OKAY MISTER O'DONNELL IN MR GALLAGHER. YEAH I JUST WANT TO. HELLO WHAT DID THE TWO OF YOU STATE IS IF THERE'S A WAY THERE'S SOME PROCESS TO MAKE THIS EASIER IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER AND WHY NOT WHEN STUDENTS FALL THE FAST WITH A HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM WHICH WE DID MY CLASSROOM MANY TIMES. CAME HAVE ANOTHER DOCUMENT AT THE SAME TIME THEY FILL OUT. FOR CALAVERAS EXCEPT AROUND THAT SEEMS O ME TO BE A NO BRAINER- NOW WE NEED TO ALSO KNOWN AS I'VE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE PAST. THERE WE HAVE A VERY WE HAVE A LOT OF UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T FIND OUT TILL THE DAY OUT THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO FELT A FASTER. THEY ARE NOT DOCUMENT A GO HOME. ONE DAY AND SAY I NEED MY NUMBER. AND THEY COME BACK THE NEXT DAY. WITHOUT A NUMBER. LEARNING FOR THE FIRST TIME. THAT THEY ARE NOT DOCUMENTED RIGHT AND IT'S A- LOT OF LOT OF LOT OF STUFF GOING ON THERE HAS BEEN THOSE THINGS OCCUR. TO ME TO ACCOMMODATE THAT TO THE AB FIVE EIGHTY STUFF FOR. MATURE WAS EIGHTY SOMETHING OUT THERE WITH THE STUDENTS FELT YOU KNOW THE- ACT BY FORTY SB FIVE FORTY Và. SO I JUST THINK THERE'S A WAY TO MAKE THIS PROCESS EASIER I'LL BET. IT WOULD SAVE ON A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS WELL. BECAUSE THERE'S GOT TO BE YOU KNOW. PROBABLY MULTIPLE PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE WORKING FOR MULTIPLE PROGRAMS OF SOMEHOW WE COMBINE THESE EFFORTS STREAMLINED THEM. AND BRING IN SOME TECHNOLOGY MY GUESS. I'M WILLING TO HEAR DIFFERENT. IS THAT THIS WOULD SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS ON BOTH SIDES THANK YOU. MR GALLAGHER. SO KIND OF GOING BACK TO THE FIRST ISSUE AND RELATED TO THIS- YOU KNOW WE'RE CHANGING THE CRITERIA FOR CAL GRANT NAY AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM STUDENT AID COMMISSION THERE'S ONLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT STUDENTS. THAT THAT. AND I THINK WE COULD ADDRESS. I THINK WE COULD ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WITH- THE STUDENTS POTENTIALLY LOSING FUNDING WITH FEDERAL FUNDS ARE CA AS YOU'VE AS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT MISTER CHAIRMAN- YOU KNOW WE HAVE MORE FEDERAL FUNDS COMING IN THOSE FUNDS COULD BE USED TO HELP SUPPORT THE STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE LOSING. MONEY BECAUSE THAT IS AN ELIGIBILITY AND THEN USE THIS YOU ARE OUR OUR STATE BUDGETARY FUNDS TO ENHANCE CAL GRANT COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS WHICH WE KNOW THERE'S NOT ENOUGH I MEAN. APPLYING FOR THESE- GRANT SAYS THAT'S ALL THAT ARE GETTING THE COMPETITIVE GRANT RIGHT NOW. THIS PROPOSAL'S GREATEST NINE THOUSAND MORE. BUT WHAT IF WE COULD BUMP THAT UP EVEN MORE AND INCREASE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IN THESE AREAS ORDER DRESS YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. I MEAN THERE'S- I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY. BETTER UTILIZE THIS MONEY TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVEN MORE STUDENTS I GUESS IS WHAT I'M GETTING AT- BY LEVERAGING OUR OUR STATE DOLLARS- TO THESE TO THESE OTHER PROGRAMS. THAT I THINK KIND OF A REALLY HIGH NEED. K. IN THIS RACE NOT ALL COME ADDRESS YOUR ISSUE AFTER AFTER THE FINISHED MR GALLAGHER SURE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK THAT IT'S CLEAR FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING THAT THIS IS JUST WERE MAKING A COMPLICATED SYSTEM EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BUT I THINK THAT- ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THAT. MOREOVER FOSTER YOUTH ARE ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS AND THEY HAVE TO BE PRIORITIES WHAT NEXT- VERY GOOD OF BUT- I WILL SAVE MY QUESTION FOR THE NEXT FOR THE NEXT PANEL. OKAY FINE SO WE'LL GET TO THAT FOSTER YOU THEY WILL HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GO OVER THAT PROPOSAL IN ONE SECOND. BUT FOR THIS ONE- I MISTER GALLAGHER I WOULD NOTE THAT THE STATE THE ISSUE THEY WERE CHANGING IN THE ELIGIBILITY- THAT'S JUST ONE TIME FOR THIS COHORT IT'S NOT ON IT'S NOT ON GOING MONEY CHANGE SO THAT'S JUST DURING THIS PANDEMIC FOR THIS LIVING SITUATION AND SO. WE DO SO IN THE NEXT YEAR THAT THAT WOULDN'T. BE THE CASE SO THERE'S NOT ANY NEW MONEY THAT WE COULD EXPAND WE'RE JUST. ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO ARE POTENTIALLY SLIPPING THE CRACKS TO KEEP THEIR MONEY- TO PAY FOR THEIR FOR THEIR TUITION IF THEY'RE CAL GRANT THE RECIPIENT SO. I DO SHARE YOUR YOUR OPTIMISM AND DESIRE TO EXPAND- COMPRESS QUALIFIED OPCODES OPPORTUNITIES FOR QUALIFIED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO PLAYED LIKE THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND THE COMPETITIVE SLOT WHO YOUR ODDS ARE HE THEY WERE ONE AND SEVEN NOW WITH THIS WHEN THEY BE ONE OF FIVE BUT STILL- WE'RE MISSING OUT SO WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER IN THIS THERE'S A PROPOSAL BY ESTIMATE COMMISSION. WHICH HAS SOME. COMPANION LEGISLATION THAT MR MEDINA I WORK ON WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A LITTLE BIT LATER- BUT- AT THIS ISSUE WE WILL WE WILL HOLD OPEN- NO ACTION TO GIVE QUESTION. YEAH SOMEONE REVISED S. ASSEMBLY WOMAN. I SHARE YOUR INTO. TO TALK ABOUT R. FIVE YOUTH SO I'M MY MIND THERE WITH. MICHAEL IS THAT RATHER MORE OF A- QUESTION FOR STACK- YOU LOOKS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CALL- IS IDENTIFYING THE NUMBER PAID. VERSUS AWARDS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- THIS GETS INTO THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM- YOU YOU YOU'RE CALLING SEVEN REFERENCING THROUGHOUT THIS MORNING'S CONVERSATION. SO THE COLUMN DESIGNATING AWARDS OF OUR THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WERE OFFERED A COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT ABOARD AT SOMETIME. THE PAID COLUMN ARE THE STUDENTS WHO ACTUALLY RECEIVED A GRANT- SO FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS- PARTICULARLY AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE ARE MANY STUDENTS WHO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND I BELIEVE IN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SPOKE TO THE SUMMER MELT ISSUE- THAT WE WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE YEARS- BUT A NUMBER OF THE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED AN AWARD MAY NOT ULTIMATELY CLAIM THAT AWARD. SO WHEN OUR OMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO ENSURE. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE- THIS FORM OF STATE SUPPORT FOR THEIR PURSUIT OF HIGHER EDUCATION IF THE STUDENT DOESN'T CLAIM I DON'T LORD THAT AWARD IS. RECYCLED AND OFFERED TO ANOTHER STUDENT PRISON THAT COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS POOL IN ORDER FOR THEM TO THEN CLAIM THE AWARD AND FOR US TO UTILIZE THE FULL NUMBER OF AWARDS THAT WERE AUTHORIZED TO PAY OUT TO STUDENTS UNDER STATUTE. ENACTED IN FUNDED BY THE BUDGET. SO YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE. YOU KNOW A LARGER. OF AWARD AND OF COURSE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WERE ACTUALLY PAID AND IN SOME INSTANCES WE ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY PAY OUT MORE STUDENTS THAN. YOU WOULD SEE YOU KNOW IT AND THE AWARD OF POLITICS FOR THAT PARTICULAR SEGMENT. AND THAT'S A FRACTION OF THIS RECYCLING PROCESS. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION AND- I'M JUSTICE SACK HAVE. CERTIFICATE COMPLETION OF GRADUATION DATA FOR THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS. COMPARED TO THE ELIGIBLE BUT NON RECIPIENTS. QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A LIMITATION WE HAVE AND STATE DATA AND- I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER CONVERSATIONS TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT THE BUDGETING PROCESS AROUND A STATE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM I'M WHAT WE GET THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION COULD IDENTIFY- THE NUMBER OF ACADEMIC TERMS FOR WHICH IS STUDENT RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID OR WHETHER THEY ALTERNATELY UTILIZED ALL OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY THERE FOR YEARS A FULL TIME ENROLLMENT ELIGIBILITY FOR RECEIPT OF STATE AID WE DON'T ULTIMATELY RECEIVED ANY DATA BACK FROM OUR SEGMENT AND CAMPUS PARTNERS ABOUT THE COMPLETION RATES OF STUDENTS AND THEIR PERSISTENCE RATES- SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD BE A WORTHWHILE. DATA POINT FOR OUR POLICYMAKERS AND EDUCATION LEADERS AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THAT CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM AND BETTER CONNECT THE EXISTING DATA SOURCES IN CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SO THAT WE CAN ANSWER THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR- DATA POINT THAT WE COULD SHARE WITH YOU ON COMPLETION RATES FOR OUR- RECIPIENTS AS A RESULT OF THAT. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU I NOW WILL GO TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. RELATED TO THE CAL GRANT ACCESS AWARD FOR FOSTER YOUTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A TWENTY MILLION ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO INCREASE THE ACCESS AWARD FOR FORMER OR CURRENT FOSTER YOUTH STUDENTS. ELIGIBLE NEW ALREADY- COVER NAY STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE AN AXIS OF WORK A FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ELIGIBLE NEW ALREADY- KALRA BE STUDENTS WILL SEE THEIR ACCESS AWARD INCREASED FROM ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. AN ELIGIBLE CONCORD NC STUDENTS WILL SEE THEIR BOOK AND SUPPLY WERE INCREASED FROM ONE THOUSAND NINETY FOUR DOLLARS TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU L. A. L. THANK YOU THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE TARGET ADDITIONAL NON TUITION INTO A GROUP OF STUDENTS THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED HIGH NEED BASED ON DATA FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION THEIR VAST MAJORITY OF AUSTRIANS ABOUT 93% OF THEIR EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION THAT'S A MEASURE OF THEIR FINANCIAL RESOURCES BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS FAMILY INCOME ASSETS INSIDE. WE'VE ALSO SEEN AN STUDENT SURVEYS THAT PHOSPHATE ELEVATED RATES OF BASIC NEEDS INSECURITY ESPECIALLY THAT COMES HOUSING AND SECURITY. IN ORDER PRO CHINA DOES HAVE A DOWNSIDE AND TACKLE COMMON MADE BY MEMBERS A MOMENT AGO ADDING IN YOUR TYPE. RISKS MAKING A COMPLICATED SYSTEM MORE COMPLICATED. WE DO THINK THAT IN THE LONG TERM LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS EXPANDING ON TUITION AID THAT DON'T RELY ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL WORDS APPROACH. SO MOMENT AGO I AND MENTION THE MEASURE OF EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION ESP SOMETHING UNLIKELY CARE MORE ABOUT LAST ISSUE ON TODAY'S AGENDA AS WELL. THERE'S BEEN SOME RECENT FEDERAL CHANGES THAT YES THE MEASURE THAT ARE INTENDED TO REFINE IT AND MAKE IT MORE USEFUL FOR STATES IDENTIFYING STUDENTS WITH THE VERY HIGHEST NEED. ONE THIS NEW MEASURES INTRODUCED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WARD HERE WE THINK IT'LL OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THIS REVISED FEDERAL MEASURE. AS A WAY TO PRIORITIZE STUDENTS FOR ADDITIONAL AID. WITHOUT RELYING ON CREATING THE SUPPLEMENTAL. AWARDS FOR VARIOUS GROUPS OF STUDENTS. TO RECOMMENDATIONS. ULTIMATELY IT'S UP PARTS. AS WITH THE PREVIOUS ISSUE AWARDS ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP THE STATE'S PROJECTED OPERATING DEFICIT IN MIND AS IT CONSIDERS LEGISLATURE TO GET HIGH BUDGET PRIOR TO TALKING EXTENSION. WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS A REASONABLE NEAR TERM OPTION TO EXPAND ON TUITION AID TO A GROUP OF STUDENTS WITH VERY HIGH NEED. IN LONGER TERM WE THINK THAT THE NEW FEDERAL STUDENT AID IMPACTS COULD PRESENT A MORE SYSTEMATIC OPTION FOR ACCOMPLISHING A SIMILAR CALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOON A COMMISSION. ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION THE COMMISSION IS GRATEFUL FOR THE RESOURCES IDENTIFIED TO SERVICE STUDENT POPULATION THAT WE KNOW CASES SO MANY ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES AND THEIR PURSUIT OF HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDING A LACK OF FAMILY RESOURCES TO DRAW UPON AS THEY TRIED TO PAY FOR COLLEGE. KEEP THAT EXPANDING ACCESS TO AID FOR CURRENT AND A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL EVIDENCED BY SEVERAL EFFORTS IN RECENT YEARS TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY PERIODS FOR CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. AND WE'RE ALSO VERY PROUD OF THE COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER ARE CHEAP THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING DR GRANT PROGRAMS. FEDERALLY STATE AND FUNDED PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH WE PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID TO ELIGIBLE FOSTER YOUTH. BY TARGETING THESE RESOURCES FOR FOSTER YOUTH WE CAN HELP MORE BE STUDENTS AFFORD HIGHER EDUCATION WITHOUT THE SAME. LEVEL OF RELIANCE ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT OR WORKING HOURS BEYOND WHAT THE ADVISABLE FOR STUDENTS A SUCCESS ACADEMICALLY. AS IT RELATES TO IMPLEMENTATION OF WE AT THE COMMISSION WOULD KNOW THAT. ABDICATE MASSE PROP HAT TOPPLED DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES OUR PURPOSE IS. FIND AN APPLICANT ALLEGED. FOR THE CHEAPER PRO THAT I JUST REFERENCED. THIS WOULD HELP US IN THE PROCESS OF ALSO CONFIRMING A FINANCIAL AID APPLICANTS POTENTIAL ELIGIBILITY FOR THIS PROPOSED ENHANCE ACCESS AWARD WITHOUT CREATING AN ADDITIONAL PROCESS FOR STUDENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY GET TO THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS STARTING WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER RACE. HERE WE GO. SO WHAT THE QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH AND IT WAS THE COMMENT WAS MADE EARLIER BY HELLO THAT IT IS MAKING A COMPLICATED SYSTEM EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BUT AGAIN IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD FOR FROM FORMER FOSTER YOUTH SO THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO SIMPLIFY THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM. WHILE MAINTAINING OUR FOCUS ON GROUPS THAT DESERVE THE EXTRA SUPPORT AND RESOURCES LIKE OUR FOSTER YOUTH AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT MAJORITY LEADER- THE PROPOSAL SKEWS ME ALSO I WANTED TO SAY IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AS TRAVIS. IT'S REALLY NICE YES WELL I YOU'RE A LEADER- THIS PROPOSAL IS BUILDING TO AN EXISTING- AND AN EXISTING NETWORK OF WILL WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE COMPLEXION OF THE SYSTEM. THIS PROPOSAL WAS SIMPLY INCREASE THE MONEY THAT STUDENTS HAD ALREADY RECEIVING ANY SOME CASES IT'S CREATED IN THE L. A. GRAN. ALREADY IN A EXIST FROM SO LIKE COCHRAN STUDENTS THERE WAS EVEN ACCESS AWARD ALREADY THAT WOULD JUST SEE THEIR AMOUNT INCREASED HIRE SOMEONE WOULD CALL AND SEE STUDENTS AND COMPANIES STUDENTS. LET'S SEE- AND YOUR WHAT UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THANK YOU. MR MEDINA THANK YOU MR REPORT- BASED ON DATA FROM A- I SEE SEE YOU THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED FROM C. SAID THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE. CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ATTENDING PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. WHO WON'T QUALIFY UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL SINCE IT'S OF LIMITED IN SCOPE OF STUDENTS ATTENDING. UNITY COLLEGE THIS OR THE UC THIS PROPOSAL MERITS LAST YEAR'S. SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT FROM THE PROPOSAL EXCLUDING THE OTHERWISE I STUDENTS WHO ATTEND A PRIVATE A PRIVATE NONPROFIT AND- WHY HAS IT BEEN A- DECLINE TO INCLUDE. THE STUDENTS IN THE. SURE MAKING YOUR QUESTION BROWN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I NEEDED TO AS A MY COLLEAGUE FEDERAL THIS A AND EXPAND OF EXISTING- THAT WE SEE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE EXIST STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENTS ACT PRO. SO I DID INDICATE THAT THEY JUST YEARS AFTER FOR ON THAT AND TO NEARING PROGRAM EXIST- AS A SIMPLE IN THE NINETEEN BUDGET. ANY ANY OTHER CRIME. FROM ANYONE ELSE. IT IS NOT AYE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONTINUED PRIVATIZATION AND FOSTER YOU BUT THE PROPOSAL WHICH EXCLUDES STUDENTS ATTENDING PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS- TO ME IS CERTAINLY NOT EQUITABLE AND I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WANT TO SUPPORT STUDENTS IN THE HIGHEST NEED WE MUST DO SUIT DO SO CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE BOARD. THANK YOU YEAH. AND I WOULD JUST ADD- MISTER MEDINA THAT EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT TWO THINGS ONE WE'RE LEAVING IT TOO MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE QUALIFIED ELIGIBLE IN THE DARK BECAUSE THE COMPETITIVE ONE AND THEN IT'S SUPER COMPLICATED AND SELL THIS JUST I KNOW FOSTER YOUTH ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEART JUST LIKE STUDENTS WITH PARENTS ARE BUT FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW. WE'RE MAKING THE COMPLICATED CAL GRANT SAYS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AND NEXT YEAR IT WILL BE ANOTHER FOR THE STUDENT STUDENTS YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW WHO HAVE COME FROM A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND OR DO YOU KNOW WHAT WHATEVER WE WANT TO FOCUS ON OTHER LCF PLUS TYPE STUDENTS- AND SO YOU KNOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THIS OR WE CAN JUST I THINK CO MINGLE THIS MONEY AND GIVE AND HAVE A SIMPLER SYSTEM AND PICK YOU KNOW MORE WINNERS THROUGH THE TRIED AND TRUE PROCESS WHICH IS. INCOME YOUR GRADES AND YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR ABILITY TO IT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AT THAT FOCUSING ON CONSOLIDATING ALL THESE- POTS OF MONEY SO WHILE I DO HAVE THAT BIG PLACE IN MY HEART FOR FOSTER YOUTH I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE WITH THAT. ARE SCARCE GENERAL FUND- RESOURCES SO. FURTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY ABOUT US. YEAH HAVING GROWN UP- NEXT TO- FOSTER YOUTH THEY ARE MY NEIGHBORS TOOK ON FOSTER YOU THREE YEARS- I UNDERSTAND THEIR DIFFICULTIES OR FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES ONCE YOU KNOW THEY TURN EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD- THEY DON'T HAVE PARENTS AND WE- AS A SOCIETY AS CALIFORNIA NEED TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THEM WITH THE FOUNDATION. WITH THE TOOLS- WITH THE RESOURCES TO BE SUCCESSFUL I WOULD AGREE WITH MR MEDINA AND NOT- IT I WOULD LOVE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER EXPANDING THIS- FOR PRIVATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. AS A YOUTH AND PARTICULARLY A FOSTER YOUTH WHEN YOU TURN EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR DIRECTION AND I STILL EVEN THOUGH OUR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FOSTER YOUTH ARE ADULTS I STILL LOOK AT THEM AS GROWING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE YOUNG. AND THAT MAKING THAT DECISION ON WHERE TO GO TO COLLEGE IS A BIG DEAL AND THEY'RE LOOKING OUT WHAT FITS THEM WHAT FITS THEIR NEEDS AS A PERSON AND SOMETIMES THAT'S OFFERED BY THE PRIVATE UNIVERSITY OR NONPROFIT UNIVERSITY SO I WOULD THINK THAT REALLY TO GIVE THEM THE FOUNDATIONAL START THAT THEY NEED WE SHOULD EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY THERE. JUST MY COMMENT THERE. I DO HAVE A QUESTION WHAT ABOUT CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY FOR FOSTER YOUTH- WHO THE ONES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN SECURING COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS WOULD THEY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS AWARD OR IS IT LIMITED TO THOSE WHO RECEIVE A CAL GRANT A. B. OR C. MMHM. I'M A STUDENT WHO RECEIVED A CARBON ABC EITHER AT THE COMPETITIVE OR THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM WILL QUALIFY FOR THE SOMEONE. SO I CAN I JUMP IN YEAH I THINK THAT AISES YOUR ISSUE BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH HAVE. COUNTLESS CHALLENGES WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN SO ARE THEY GOING TO AS MR O'DONNELL SAID NO AND THEIR HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM TO FILL UP THAT FAST SO WHEN THEY'RE SEVENTEEN. THIRD FOCUSING WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO SIX SURVIVING WHEN THEY TURN EIGHTEEN AND AGE OUT. SO THE ODDS ARE THE STUDENTS. MAYBE A COUPLE YEARS LATER FIGURE IT OUT OKAY I WANNA APPLY FOR A CAL GRANT NOW THEY GET IN THIS. POOL WHERE THERE ARE CHANCES ARE ONE IN FIVE AND SO THE STUDENTS WHO WE THERE'S A FEW STUDENTS TO GET IN. WE'RE GIVING THEM MORE SUPPORT WHICH THEY DESPERATELY NEED BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE FOR THEIR NEED TO PAY FOR HOUSING AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS TREMENDOUS WE GET THAT. BUT BY DOING THAT YOU'RE GIVING THE FEW. BUT A GREATER OPPORTUNITY BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE LEAVING OUT THE MASSES WHO NEVER EVEN GOT THEIR FOOT THE DOOR IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. IT'S A IT'S A BALANCING ACT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO WE HAVE YOU KNOW UP SCARCE RESOURCES WE CAN MAKE THAT THE WISEST CHOICE. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT BRINGS UP THE POINT THAT WE NEED TO EVALUATE. SO JUST TO CLARIFY THAT MR GALLAGHER. RIGHT SO IT'S IF YOU'VE GOTTEN IS THE BEST A GOOD GALLOP MAKE. SO JUST TO CLARIFY IT ON THAT IS ONLY IF YOU AB SEE THE UROLOGY FOR THIS RIGHT YOU CAN'T OR COMPETITIVE. OUR COMPETITORS RIGHT. YES THAT'S CORRECT THE STUDENT NEEDS TO GET A CALL GRANT IN ORDER TO GET AN ACCESS SOMEONE. WE JUST POINT OUT THAT- FOSTER AND KAREEM ALLSTATE GRAHAM. THE FORMAT GRANDFATHER YOU'D STUDENTS- HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO APPLY FOR AN ENTITLEMENT COCHRAN- AND WE UNDERSTAND WE RECOGNIZE THE MANY STUDENTS TO STRUGGLE TO WALK TOWARDS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. I AM SO THIS ADDITIONAL GRANT WILL SERVE THAT PURPOSE. AND I DID HAVE ONE ONE LAST QUESTION- ARE ADOPTED FOSTER YOU INCLUDED AN EXPANDED CAL GRANT AND TRY TO MELD ABILITY AUTHORIZED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN. FOR THE COPPER THEY ACCESS OUR WATER. I'M SORRY IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION I REMEMBER SO I'M IF YOU'RE IN ADOPTED FOSTER YOUTH DO YOU STILL QUALIFY. I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE IN C. SACK- JAKE. THANKS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE ARE SPECIFIC- UP FOR DATE- AND THAT IS THAT IS HEAT WITH THE STATUS OF THE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN WHICH THEY NEEDED TO HAVE TO BE IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM. THAT'S THE DATA THAT'S- THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER THIS IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND THAT WE USE THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER A STUDENT MIGHT FIT- ELIGIBILITY FOR CHEAP YOU GRANT PROGRAMS THAT COULD ALREADY CURRENTLY SERVES FORMER- AND CURRENT FOSTER YOUTH STUDENTS. SO IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION IT WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON THE AGE AT WHICH THEY WERE ADOPTED OUT OF THE FOSTER SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE A AND APPROXIMATELY. APPROXIMATELY WHAT AGE. I BELIEVE THAT IT'S EITHER THEIR SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY- BUT I CAN GET BACK TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF WITH THE- THE SPECIFIC- H. TIME FRAMES THAT IS THE ISSUE WITH THE ELIGIBILITY DEFINITION THAT A DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- VERIFIED SPORTS. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. WITH YOUR HAND MISTER LEE NOW. OKAY MISTER DONNA JUST ACAR WITH REGARD TO THIS- FOSTER YOUTH AND REALLY I THINK THE GOAL HERE THIS MONIES TO ENSURE THEIR SUCCESS. AND THIS IS SOMETHING I SAW MY OWN CLASSROOMS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER OFTEN SENIORS THE GRADUATE AND THE KIND OF PUT ON A BOAT OUT THERE WITH NO SALE. RIGHT AND SO I THINK GET A MONEY IS BECAUSE PART OF THE ANSWER BUT IT'S ALSO STRONG PROGRAMS THAT ASSIST STUDENTS THAT FIND THEMSELVES IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HERE'S ORGANIZATIONS DOWN IN LA UNITED FRIENDS THE CHILDREN IS VERY ACTIVE ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS KIDS TRANSITIONING OUT OF FOSTER YOU. SO HOPE SOME POINT WE WOULD ALSO HOW DO YET YOU KNOW TO LEVERAGES. MONEY AND ENSURE THAT HE GETS. IN THAT GETS USERS. TO SECURE. SUCCESS I DON'T KNOW THE JUST HANDING IS THE STUDENT MONEY OR OR MAYBE. IT PARTNERING WITH CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO OFFER TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WE DON'T WANT TO LONG BEACH- AND THEY TEACH TO NEAR THE LIFE SKILLS OF BANKING SAID RECEIVING- THIS IS PUT THEIR POST HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE GETTING HIM INTO SCHOOL HAVE A LOT OF SUCCESS UNITED FRIENDS THE CHILDREN TO US. I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE UNFORTUNATELY NOT ENOUGH OF THEM. BUT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MONEY TO INCENTIVIZE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THAT. TO PICK UP MORE CLIENTELE. TO ASSIST FOSTER USED TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO DID JUST I JUST THAT'S MORE THAT'S BROADER TOPIC THAN TODAY BUT- I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD. BE THINKING. ABOUT THINGS MORE THAN JUST HANDING THEM BRANDS. BUT GEE HOW DO WE WANT TO HANDLE GRANT HOW THEY SUCCESSFULLY MANEUVER THROUGH THE SYSTEM IN LIFE. AND BUILDING THOSE THAT NECESSARY. SKILL SET TO DO SO. BUT HE- OKAY THANK YOU THIS ISSUE WILL BE HELD OPEN. THING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- NEXT ISSUE THE CAL GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. IS SEVEN HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND I'M GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE FINAL PHASE OF THE GRAND DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT. AND I'M GOING MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION COSTS THIS PROJECT IS SCHEDULED TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU L. L. LOOKING AT THE TABLE AND TO TOP OF PAGE TWELVE OF YOUR HEARING AND THAT PROVIDES A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON HOW THE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DECIDED. TO PLAY ONE POINT ONE MILLION WOULD BE SPENT A ONE TIME BASIS FOR PROJECT CONSULTANTS TO FINISH THE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS PHASE OF THIS PROJECT AN INITIAL SEVEN HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND COMBINED WOULD BE PROVIDED AN ONGOING BASIS FOR CERTAIN RECURRING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COSTS. SINCE THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR THIS PROJECT THE SUBMITTED IN THE FALL THE COMPLETION DATE HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT. WAS ONE FROM NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR TO APRIL OF THE SPRING IS YOU NEED COMMISSION HAS RECENTLY SUBMITTED A SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AFTER FLOOD SCHEDULE CHANGE. OUR OFFICE EXPECTS TO RECEIVE THIS SPR FROM CITY IN THE COMING WEEKS AND ONCE WE RECEIVE IT WILL REVIEW THE INFORMATION ME CHAPTER STAFF RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU STATE COMMISSION. THANK YOU CHECK- MCCARTY JAKE BRUNNER STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND THE COMMISSION REQUESTED THESE FUNDS FOR THE FINAL PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE FOLLOWING MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF OUR GREAT DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT OR AS WE FONDLY REFER TO IT GSM AND I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THIS IS THE COMMISSION SPINAL FUNDING REQUEST ANTICIPATED FOR THIS PROJECT. AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE COMMISSION DUE TO THE VOLUME AND SENSITIVITY OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT WE PROCESS EACH YEAR ANNUALLY THE COMMISSION RECEIVED AS MANY AS TWO MILLION APPLICATIONS AND APPROPRIATES TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS. AND PRIOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GSM OF THE COMMISSION WITH USING A NINETEEN SYSTEM THAT WAS MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD TO DO ALL OF THIS- SO YOU CAN CONSIDER THAT SIGNIFICANT RISKS THAT ARE POSED BY OUTAGES OF THE SYSTEM LET ALONE- ANY. SORT OF A SECURITY BREACH. AB START HAS ALREADY SEEN MANY OF ITS BE. THE BY. OUR CORE YOU. IN THOSE CRITICALLY ARE STUDENTS. THE NEW BUT GRANTS FOR STUDENTS WAS LAUNCHED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND SERVICE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS APPLYING FOR IT. YOUR CHEN DIDN'T MATERIAL ALTERNATIVES WILL BE. PROVIDED INCLUDING ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE MOBILE DEVICES AND OTHER WEB BROWSERS TO ACCESS OUR PLATFORM. WHICH WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE. USER INTERFACE IS ALSO NOW MORE INTUITIVE AND PROVIDES STUDENTS WITH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND DETAILS. ABOUT THE STATUS OF THEIR CAL GRANT AND A TO DO LIST- TO HELP GUIDE THEM THROUGH ANY REMAINING STEPS. IN ADDITION A WEB GRANTS FOR STUDENTS THE COMMISSION IS ALSO LAUNCHED WHAT BRANDS FOR THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD PROGRAM. AND OUR CHIEF YOU GRANT PROGRAM FOR FOSTER YOUTH STUDENTS. THERE WAS A DELAY OF A FEW MONTHS TO ALLOW FOR MORE THOROUGH TESTING DURING THIS PERIOD. TO ENSURE THAT THE RELEASE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FACING A SIDE OF THIS PROJECT. WAS AS EFFECTIVE AND BUG FREE AS POSSIBLE. AS NOTED BY LA YOU KNOW WE ANTICIPATE LAUNCHING WEB GRANTS. FOR STUDENTS IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. AND I'M JOINT BY VICTIMS. CHIEF AND FOR OFFICER BERMAN- BANGING. WHO WILL- JOIN ME IN. ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. OKAY MR GALLAGHER. YES SO THIS LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE UNFORTUNATELY RARE EXAMPLES OF AID AND I. T. PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED- AND SO I CONGRATULATE YOU GUYS- THIS IS IT'S GOOD TO SEE THIS IS GOING TO BE THAT LAST FUNDING WE'RE GETTING THIS COMPLETE- ONE QUESTION I HAD IS SO- I BELIEVE WAS IN TWENTY NINETEEN- YOU KNOW THE- C. SACK WAS. IDENTIFIED AS A VOTER REGISTRATION AGENCY BASED ON A FEDERAL COURT RULING- AND- I THINK LAST BUDGET YOU GUYS IT ASKS FOR FUNDING TO HELP STATE FUNDING TO HELP WITH. OBVIOUSLY THE OUTRAGE AND- EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH BEING A DESIGNATED VOTER REGISTRATION AGENCY- I THINK SOME OF THE THOUGHT WOULD BE LIKE YOU KNOW WHY NOT SEEK FEDERAL FUNDS SINCE THIS IS A FEDERAL ROLE IN YOUR FEDERAL FUNDS TO COVER THE COST OF THAT- BUT MY QUESTION WOULD BE ARE. AS ANY OF THE ONE TIME OR ONGOING FUNDING THAT WORD. THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING- THAT WERE. DESIGNATING TOWARDS THIS I. T. SYSTEM AND FINISHING THAT IS ANY OF THAT GOING TO BE MOVED OVER- AS COSTS FOR THE VOTER. REGISTRATION AGENCIES FUNDING. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER- AS OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE L. A. O. NOTED I'M IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS THERE IS A BREAKDOWN OF THE ANTICIPATED COSTS- THAT ARE ALL INCLUDE THE ON GOING EXPENSES THAT WILL OCCUR. AND ARE JEDIISM PROJECT- HELPED US SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE STATE FINANCIAL AID- PROGRAMS THAT WERE AUTHORIZED TO ADMINISTER SO- I DON'T I THINK THAT THE IT'S WOVEN THROUGH ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS IS THIS MECHANISM FOR WHICH I'M WERE CONTACTED ABOUT VOTER REGISTRATION- BUT I'LL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE- GREATER- TO SEE IF HE MIGHT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT HOW THAT- AND WE ARE A- COMPLIANCE PIECE FITS IN WITH THE COSTS ASSOCIATED HERE BUT- I THINK REALLY THEY'RE- THEY'RE MORE REFLECTIVE OF. HARDWARE CLOUD SERVERS SOFTWARE LICENSES AND THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH- DELIVERY OF ITS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. BUT OF AUTHENTIC BURGER. GOOD MORNING IN CHAIR AND MEMBERS IS BAY CHIEF. OFFICER CALIFORNIANS IT COMMISSION. YEAH REGARDING AND WE ARE A I THINK RIGHT NOW MOST OF THE COMPLIANCE IS MET MANUALLY- BUT ONCE FULLER MAIN CORE FUNCTIONALITY. OF GSM IS COMPLETED. WE WILL BE LOOKING INTO IMPLEMENTING NPR RAY BUT- DEFINITELY AND WILL REQUIRE SOME FUNDING. IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME CHANGES THERE. OF THESE FINDINGS WERE. MOSTLY FOR UPGRADING THE EXISTING GRANTED THE PRE SYSTEM AND MAKING SURE THE STUDENTS HAVE PROPER ACCESS AND DIGITAL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING UP SYSTEM ARE UP AND RUNNING TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN. OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY THIS FUNNY REQUEST IS JUST FOR DOING THE UPDATE- TO THE SYSTEM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND IS NOT GOING TOWARDS N. DRA. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY AND THEN ARE YOU GUYS PURSUING ANY FEDERAL FUNDS TO MEET COMPLIANCE SO THAT. WE HAVE NOT BEEN DIRECTLY AT THE SKI NAY COMMISSION BUT- I DON'T KNOW IF OUR PARTNERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MIGHT HAVE- ANY ANYTHING FURTHER THEY pFEDERAL FUNDS AND CAN BE UTILIZED BY THE STATE. HI BRIANNA FRIENDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT OUR OFFICEIS LOOKED INTO YOU- HOWEVER TO THE EXTENT NEEDED WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO. WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THAT CALIFORNIA'S YOU NEED COMMISSION. ON TO IT TO ASSIST THEM THERE. SOUNDS LIKE NOW RIGHT NOW OKAY. FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT NOW OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. SING NINE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL ADDRESS LATER IN THE SUB COMMITTEE PROCESS WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN A NEXT ISSUE CALFRESH ACCESS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS. OKAY IN MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME'S ALEXIS FERNANDES AND I'M THE CHIEF OF THE CALIFORNIA NUTRITION BRANCH AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES MY BRANCH OVERSEES THE ADMINISTRATION OF SEVEN FEDERAL NUTRITION PROGRAMS AS WELL AS SEVERAL STATE FUNDED PROGRAM. IMPORTANTLY WE OVERSEE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE OF SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR SNAP KNOWN AS CALFRESH IN CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC HEALTH QUESTION NUTRITION BRANCH HAS LONG PRIORITIZED CALIFORNIA'S PARTICIPATION AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO A FEW OF OUR MORE RECENT EFFORTS IN THIS AREA- BUT FIRST I WANT TO TOUCH ON THE POLICY CHALLENGE THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE. IN BEING THE TRUMP ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH. FEDERAL PROGRAM RULES GENERALLY EXCLUDE COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM SNAP ELIGIBILITY UNLESS THEY ARE EMPLOYED AT LEAST TWENTY HOURS ON AVERAGE PER WEEK FOR ME AN EXCEPTION FROM THE RULE. SUCH AS BEING APPROVED FOR OR ANTICIPATING PARTICIPATION IN WORK STUDY. ATTENDING A SCHOOL AS PART OF AN EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING PROGRAM FOR RECEIVING ANOTHER CAL WORKS WHEN THE BENEFIT INCLUDING A CAMERA. THIS RULE COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE CALFRESH STUDENT ELIGIBILITY RULE IS LONGSTANDING AND HAS ITS ROOTS IN A NOW OUTDATED ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE. MAINLY THAT STUDENTS INCOME AND RESOURCES MIGHT BE TEMPORARILY LOW BUT THAT MOST HAVE PARENTS OR OTHER RELATIVES WHO WILL ENSURE THEY THEY DO NOT GO HUNGRY. IN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT UPPER MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES FROM RECEIVING THE BACK STEPS BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. CONGRESS ESTABLISH A SPECIAL SET OF ELIGIBILITY RULES THAT PREVENT MANY STUDENTS FROM ACCESSING. THE CONTROL NUTRITION BENEFITS AND BY NO MEANS OF REPRESENTS. THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY STUDENTS TODAY. SO TO ADDRESS CHALLENGE ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING CLIENT ADVOCATES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS COUNTY AND OTHER- GOVERNMENT PARTNERS INCLUDING AS THE SACK WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT TIME AND ENERGY INTO ADDRESSING STUDENT ELIGIBILITY AND MAXIMIZING ACCESS. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT FEDERAL RULE. AS I MENTIONED I'LL HIGHLIGHT SOME OF OUR MORE RECENT EFFORTS IN THIS AREA. TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE PROCESS THE PROBLEM WE RECENTLY ISSUED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE PUBLIC POSTSECONDARY SEGMENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. ESTIMATING THE GAP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF LIKELY CALIFORNIA LEGIBLE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ACTUALLY RECEIVING CALFRESH. WE ALSO PUT THEM RECOMMENDATIONS BOARD AIMED AT CLOSING THAT GAP WITH OUR PARTNERS. WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA COPIER. MENTION NOT THE REPORT ESTIMATES THAT IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SCHOOL YEAR THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS RECEIVING CALFRESH WAS JUST OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS LIKELY ELIGIBLE FELL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AND JUST UNDER SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND AND AGAIN THAT RANGE IS LARGE BECAUSE OF SOME SIGNIFICANT CARDIAC WITH AVAILABLE DATA. THE BILL WORK IN BETTER UNDERSTANDING GAP. PARTNERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LATIN OR C. PL TO CONDUCT MORE ANALYSIS BY CPR WAS PART OF OUR REPORT WORKGROUP AND WITNESS THE DIFFICULTY WE HAD IN TRYING TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. THROUGH DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS YOU CAN TELL WILL ANALYZE ELIGIBILITY TAKE UP AND IMPACTS OF CALIFORNIA'S FOR STUDENTS WILL BE LINKING DE IDENTIFIED ADMINISTRATIVE. ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AT THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT LEVEL DATA- AND IT WILL PROVIDE MORE TESTING OF THE NUMBERS WERE ELIGIBLE WE ALSO THINK THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USEFUL AND TARGETING REACH- OUR PARTNERS TO PROMOTE CALFRESH I TAKE UP WE'RE WORKING WITH C. SACK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE UC SYSTEM THE FINAL IDEA SHARING AGREEMENTS AND BE ABLE TO FACILITATE THIS PROJECT. WELL UNDERSTANDING THAT DATA IS IMPORTANT THE RULE ITSELF IS THE BARRIER TO ACCESS SO RECOGNIZING THIS CONGRESS RECENTLY ACTED TO TEMPORARILY EXPANDS ELIGIBILITY IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY. WE HAVEN'T. LAUNCHED AN EFFORT TO ROLL OUT THESE CHANGES QUICKLY. INFORM NEWLY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS OF THE CHANGE AND FACILITATE THEIR APPLICATION FOR COCKROACH. THE CHANGES EXTENDED TO LARGE GROUPS. THOSE. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A WORK STUDY. AND THOSE HAVE AN X. FAMILY CONTRIBUTION OF ZERO DOLLARS ASK CALCULATED BY THE FACT. WE ESTIMATE FOR THE CURRENT ACADEMIC YEAR THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS TO HAVE A ZERO P. F. SEAT AND AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR WORK STUDY. AND I'LL NOTE THAT THERE IS SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS. ARE THESE CHANGES ARE. TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY WILL BE IN EFFECT AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS LIFTED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO. VERY LIKELY FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AND WE HAVE LAUNCHED A COUPLE MAJOR OUTREACH EFFORTS. TO REACH THEM AND MAKE THEM AWARE OF THE CHANGE SO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STOCK WE WILL BE CONDUCTING OUTREACH TO ALL THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ZERO DOLLARS EST STUDENTS. AND OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION WILL BE CONDUCTING OUTREACH TO WORK STUDY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. OTHER STATEWIDE OUTREACH CAMPAIGN STARTED THIS WEEK YESTERDAY O BE EXACT. THE OUTCOMES OF THE SHORT TERM CHANGE CURRENT FORM OF COURSE LONGER. TERM CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THAT'S FROM HER CHANGE TO THE FEDERAL STUDENT ELIGIBILITY RULES. WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT EFFORTS AIMED AT MAXIMISING PARTICIPATION SO I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE ONE UPCOMING EFFORT RELATED TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. FEDERAL REGULATIONS ALLOW FOR STUDENTS WERE TAKING COURSES THAT ARE PART OF THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM TO BE EXEMPT FROM THE RULE. OUR PARTNERS IN NEW YORK STATE RECENTLY USED THIS REGULATION TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. AT LEAST ON THEIR MODEL WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO IDENTIFY WHICH OF THEIR PROGRAMS NEAT FEDERAL DEFINITION. AND I WHICH STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED SO THAT WE CAN REACH OUT TO THEM AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THIS NEW EXEMPTION- THEY MAY HAVE ACQUIRED FOR CALIFORNIA BEFORE AND THEN DETERMINE INELIGIBLE THIS EXPANDED POLICY. WORK MAY MAKE THEM ELIGIBLE NOW. THE COMMUNITY CALL ESTIMATED THIS CHANGE COULD IMPACT THE MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS BUT ACTUALLY UP TO A MILLION. I WILL BE WORKING WITH THEM ON HOW BEST TO IDENTIFY INFORM THE STUDENTS. WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY DEVELOP GUIDANCE FOR A COUNTY PARTNERS TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT ARE TO BE ON TRACK TO IMPLEMENT THIS CHANGE AHEAD OF THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE TURN. FIVE THE LET ME JUST WRAP UP BY THINKING THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO PREVENTING EXPERIENCE OF HUNGER AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS. WE'VE SEEN QUITE A FEW INVESTMENTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND TO OUR PARTNERS TO ENGAGE WITH US REGULARLY- INCREASED THE SACROILIAC FROM IN JUST A MOMENT. AND OF COURSE MY TEAM WAS WATCHING FROM HOME- I HAVE DILIGENTLY FACILITATING THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND EFFORTS. ARE SURE TO QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS ONE OF THE- THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MR NEED COMMISSION. OKAY GOOD MORNING JERRY MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARLENE GARCIA I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION THANK YOU FOR INVITING THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO SPEAK ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TO HELP MORE LOW INCOME COLLEGE STUDENTS ACCESS CALFRESH BENEFITS ESPECIALLY DURING THIS. CRISIS AS YOU KNOW STUDENT HUNGER IS REAL ON ALL CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE IN ANY GIVEN MONTH ONE IN THREE STUDENTS REPORTS EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT. SURVEY AND IN THE WAKE OF THE CODE NINETEEN CRISIS THE PROBLEM HAS ONLY WORSENED. NO CAMPUS IS IMMUNE FROM THE PROBLEM OF STUDENT HUNGER ALL THE SEGMENTS UCCS YOU INDEPENDENT COLLEGES COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE STRUGGLING TO SUPPORT THE GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH FOOD INSECURITY. THEY SET UP FOOD PANTRIES BASIC NEEDS CENTERS AND ARE WORKING WITH COUNTY OFFICES TO HELP STUDENTS APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE CALFRESH BENEFITS. THE STATE HAS ALSO INVESTED VITAL RESOURCES TO HELP INSTITUTIONS SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS BUT THE NEED CONTINUES TO EXCEED AVAILABLE CAMPUS RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO CALFRESH CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR. MOST COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE. THE COMMISSION IS COMMITTED TO FINDING NEW WAYS TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA POSTSECONDARY STUDENTS BY IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS TO FILL THE GAP IN THERE AND BETHANY. NEEDS I'M TACKLING FOOD INSECURITY FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS IS ESSENTIAL TO HELP THEM PERSISTENCE. EXCEEDING COLLEGE. CALFRESH PROGRAM DOES ALL COULD READ THAT CAN HELP OFFICE THE FOOD COSTS FOR STUDENTS YET WE KNOW THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE BUT ARE NOT APPLYING. SO IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THE COMMISSION CONVENED A CALFRESH WORK GROUP TO EXAMINE HOW TO SIMPLIFY AND INCREASE THE COLLEGE STUDENT UP TAKE. A FINANCIALLY BENEFITS. THE WORKGROUP INCLUDES ALL THE MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS- WHO WORK ON THIS ISSUE FROM WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE AND- POLICY ADVOCATES OUTSIDE THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING POLICY EXPERTS FOR BOTH SOCIAL SERVICES AND HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR. AS NOTED EARLIER BY ALEXIS FERNANDEZ THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED ORIGINALLY TO KEEP COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM ACCESSING FROM ACCESSING FOOD BENEFITS WELL IT SUCCEEDED. ONLY 18% STUDENTS ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE- ARE ARE ARE ONLY THAT THOSE 18% CRAP THAT AFFECTS. SO THE PROGRAM IS FALLING HOLY SHORT AND IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS FEDERAL RESOURCE THAT IS AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS. SO THE GOAL OF THE WORKGROUP IS TO STREAMLINE THE SYSTEM BY WHICH STUDENTS ACCESS- CALFRESH BENEFITS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLEX RULES AS ALEXIS ALLUDED TO EARLIER THAT PERTAIN ONLY TO COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THESE RULES WHICH DO NOT APPLY TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. KLEIST MAKE IT CHALLENGING NOT JUST FOR STUDENTS TO ENROLL BUT ALSO FOR COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. AND THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE BOTTOM BACK AND APPROVING. COLLEGE STUDENT APPLICATIONS. SO THERE ARE SOME. THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COLLEGE YOU TO APPLY CREEK FOR CAL OWN ABOUT THREE SEVEN. ARE COMPARED 260% FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. NOW AS YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT STEP OF TEMPORARILY EXPANDING YOU CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY FOR STUDENTS WITH ZERO ESC AB FOR FEDERAL WORK STUDY STUDENTS TO DRUM. I TRUST THE HUNGER CRISIS EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC. BUT GIVEN THIS NEW TEMPORARY DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE IMMEDIATE. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WHO NEED THE MONEY FOR TODAY. SO C. SACK IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION. TO HELP FINANCIALLY STUDENTS ENROLLING CALPERS BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A TOUCH POINT WITH THE STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE. WE CAN QUICKLY IDENTIFY AND COMMUNICATE WITH ALL THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH ZERO YES SEE AND WORK WITH OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY. FEDERAL WORK STUDY STUDENTS. AS A MATTER OF FACT NOTIFICATIONS LETTERS WENT OUT JUST YESTERDAY AS A LEXUS- NOTED UP TO ALL THE STUDENTS URGING THEM TELLING THEM THAT THEY ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S ZERO EST. AND URGING THEM TO GO TO THE GET CALFRESH OUT AND SIGNED UP IMMEDIATELY AND IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR TO CALL THE. CALIFORNIA STUDENT BODY CONDITION. SO THE DIFFERENCE BY WHAT WE'RE TALKING BY THE ABLE TO REALLY. AND TARGET STUDENTS KNOW OUR- IT'S DIFFERENT FROM PASSED SEPARATELY WE JUST SORT OF BLANKETS GROUPS AND LET THEM KNOW THEY'RE HEALTH QUESTIONS. HOPING THAT WE WITH OUR CAPTURE THOSE STUDENTS WENT BACK WERE ELIGIBLE AND SAW THIS WITH YOU KNOW TABLE SET UP ON CAMPUSES EMAILS FLYERS AND SO FAR. SO WHAT WE'RE ABLE DO WITH THE STUDENT AID CAN ARE TO MANY. PARTS OF THIS PROCESS THERE'S THE INTAKE INVOLVEMENT PART IS GETTING IDENTIFYING THE STUDENTS AND GETTING THEM TO APPLY AND THEN THERE'S THE- BACKEND- VERIFICATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS. WE'RE SEIZE THAT CAN PLAY A ROLE IS IN THE IDENTIFICATION WORKING WITH OUR CDS ASSET OTHERS TO IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS AND TO BE AVAILABLE TO PROTECTION YOU CAN REACH OUT TO STUDENTS IF IN FACT. WE ENGAGE IN SOME DATA SHARING WITH LOCAL COUNTIES. TO REALLY ENCOURAGE ALL STUDENTS WERE ZERO YES SEEK TO APPLY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. TEMPORARY OPPORTUNITY- LASTLY I JUST LIKE TO THANK ALL THE- WHO HELPED US WITH THIS ESPECIALLY THE CESS. RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY AND WORKING WITH US- ONCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THESE NEW TEMPORARY ELIGIBLE EASING THESE TEMPORARY HOW TO BILL AB- REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT WE CAN HELP STUDENTS OF SIGNED UP FOR AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE ARE RESOURCES THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL. TO THERE ARE SUCCESS IN COLLEGE. SO UNLESS OR ANY. ON MY RETURN NOW TO WELL BARTTELOT MY STAFF FROM CONSULTANT WILL TALK TO WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE WORK GROUP'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION AS WELL AS FOR SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM. POSSIBILITIES THANK YOU MELISSA. MORNING TERRITORY IN NUMBERS MY NAME IS MELISSA HART- AND I AM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST FOR THE COMPANIES TO EATEN CHEN I THOUGHT WE STAFF FOR THE COMMISSION COCKROACH WORKGROUP- I'M GRATEFULTO PROVIDE AN UPDATE YOU ON THE WORK GROUPS ARE ROTH. I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION CURRENTLY INTERACTS WITH- HELLO FRESH. IN IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES. IN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AND REFER TO THE TEMPORARY HAPPENED THE ENGINE. ZERO EST STUDENTS. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF SENDING OUT LETTERS TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS STATEWIDE THAT QUALIFY FOR THE EXPANSION. THE LIKE TRONIC LETTERS SERVE AS PROOF OF A STUDENTS ZERO EST STATIC AND ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR CALFRESH. I THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PURSUANT TO AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN BY FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER WATER WE HAVE BEEN SENDING ELECTRONIC LETTERS TO RECIPIENTS OF POWER GRANTS FUNDED BY FEDERAL TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES OR TANF DOLLARS. QUALIFY FOR KENNETH ARE ALSO RECEIVING A CALGARY AB OR B. TUITION AWARD AFTER CAL GRANT PARTIALLY FUNDED BY KENNETH DOLLARS THUS QUALIFYING THEM FOR ONE OF THE STUDENTS ELIGIBLE BE MORE CONSCIOUS. SIMILARLY BIG LETTERS SERVE AS PROOF THAT STUDENTS ARE IN RECEIPT OF A CAN OF FUNDED BENEFIT FOR VERIFICATION PURPOSES AND ENCOURAGED ME TO APPLY TO COUGH RASH WE FOUND OUT ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND. LETTERS TO STUDENTS EACH YEAR. I ALEXIS MY EARLIER COSTUME ARE SUBJECTED TO DIFFERENT SNAP- DIFFERENT TOPICAL OINTMENTS DUE TO THE FEDERAL STUDENT ELIGIBILITY ROLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FACE MANY BARRIERS TO CALFRESH ENROLLMENT DESPITE BEING ELIGIBLE AND IN NEED OF THIS ASSISTANCE. THAT IS WHY THE WORK GROUP IS FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING SHORT AND LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING COLLEGE STUDENT ENROLLMENT IN TOP RUSH. ONE AREA THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION IN THE WAKE OF TEMPORARY FEDERAL EXPANSION OF SNAP IF THE STOCK WATCHING A STATE WIDE CALFRESH CALL CENTER FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION CURRENTLY HAVE A FULLY OPERATIONAL STUDENT CALL CENTER WITH FIFTEEN EMPLOYEES THE OPERATING MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY FROM EIGHT AM TO FOUR FORTY FIVE PM. THE FACT STAFF ARE EXTENSIVELY TRAINED TO HANDLE SENSITIVE STUDENT INFORMATION AND IF THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES DIRECTLY WITH COMPLEX FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS. FURTHERMORE FEEDBACK HAD DEMONSTRATED THE CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO NEW REQUIREMENTS THERE ARE READ THE DEFINITION OF THE VOTER REGISTRATION EACH WEEK. BUT OUR CALL CENTER STAFF ARE TRAINED AND FINANCIALLY MATTER BUT ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING EATING CUSTOMERS THAT WISH TO REGISTER TO VOTE. OVERALL SEE THOUGHT HAVE THE ESTABLISHED CALL CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE AND IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO PROVIDE TIMELY AND RELIABLE SERVICE JUSTIN SPEAKING AT THE STINTS WITH COCKROACH. WITH ADDITIONAL ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT OUR CALL CENTER COULD HIRE LIMITED TERM STOCK TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY TO START PROVIDING ONE ON ONE TALK FRESH APPLIQUE. APPLICATION ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS. THE PROPOSAL FEEDBACK WOULD BECOME AN OFFICIAL OUTRAGE CONTRACTOR WITH YET ALLOWING US TO GET THE PROPER TRAINING FOR OUR STAFF. AND ALSO DRAW DOWN MATCHING FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR SNAP OUTREACH. CALL CENTER COULD IF THE STUDENTS WITH COMPLETING THE CALFRESH APPLICATION AND ASSISTANCE WITH THE MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROCESS AND PREPARING FOR THE INTERVIEW. THE COMMISSION AND ALSO ANY. POSITION TO CONDUCT DIRECT AVERAGE JUST UNIONS THAT ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH. FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY HAVE A ZERO EST OR IF THEY RECEIVED A CHECK FROM THE TELEGRAPH. IDEALLY THIS STATE WHY CALL CENTER WOULD BE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH A WARM HAND OFF TO THE COLLEGE TO THE COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING CAL FASHION APPLICATION. COMPLETING THE MANDATORY VERIFICATION AND CONDUCTING TOP RUSSIAN INTERVIEWS. OVERALL THE COMMISSION AND THE WORKGROUP BELIEVES THAT SYSTEM TAILORED TO THE COLLEGE STUDENT EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO MAKING MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TOWARDS COLLEGE STREET IN MOMENT AND CONFERENCE. AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST STATEWIDE OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. THAT CAN ASSIST IN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ESTABLISHING A STATE MY CALL CENTER. AIMED AT CALFRESH OUTREACH TO COLLEGE STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WOULD BE COST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF IMPROVING STUDENT INVOLVEMENT CALFRESH AND THAT'S DRAWING DOWN MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO ALLEVIATE FOOD INSECURITY. CALFRESH WORKERS HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED SEVERAL SHORT AND LONG TERM STRATEGY AIMED AT IMPROVING THE UPTAKE OF COMMERCE BENEFITS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE SHORT TERM STRATEGIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED REVOLVE AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIARY PARTICULARLY SHARING INFORMATION WITH COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKER THAT DO THE WORK OF VERIFYING STE YOU DON'T SEE ME AN EXEMPTION TO THE STUDENT ELIGIBILITY WILL. FOR HEATING DATA SHARING BETWEEN THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION- SECONDARY INSTITUTION I LOCAL HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES COULD AFFECT COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS WITH. WITH ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIER IN THE CONFERENCE APPLICATIONS FOR STUDENTS. FURTHERMORE IF CALIFORNIA COULD CONSOLIDATE VARIOUS DATA SOURCES TO CREATE A STUDENT ELIGIBILITY WILL VERIFICATION HOW. THE VERIFICATION PROCESS COULD BE MUCH EASIER FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND ELIGIBILITY WORKERS. THE WORK GROUP HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPLORING THE FEASIBILITY OF USING CANNOT FUNDS FOR OTHER FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT. TO SPEND ON THE POSSIBLE STUDENT EXEMPTIONS AND THEREFORE DRAW DOWN MORE FEDERAL SNAP DOLLARS. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE STATE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS PARTIALLY FUNDED BY KENNETH DOLLARS MEANING THAT RECIPIENTS OF KENNETH FUNDED CAL GRANT. QUALIFY FOR AN EXEMPTION TO THE STUDENT ELIGIBILITY RULE AND CAN QUALIFY FOR CALFRESH. HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS CANNOT BENEFIT FROM FUNDED CAL GRANT TUITION AWARD. BECAUSE TO ME IN COLLEGE STUDENTS ONLY RECEIVE CALGARY AID WHO THE CALL GRANT ACCESS TO WORK. THIS IS WHY WE ARE. OPPORTUNITIES TO REPLICATE THIS MODEL WITH OTHER FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS BUT THE FACULTY TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE WORKER BUT ALSO EXPLAIN STRATEGIES TO INTEGRATE INFORMATION FROM THE FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID OR FAST. WITH THE CALL FRESH APPLICATION OR CREATE SOME SORT OF WARM HAND OFF BETWEEN THE TWO APPLICATIONS. THE PATH APPLICATION ASK STUDENTS OVER HUNDRED QUESTIONS INCLUDING DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT FAMILY INCOME. AMERICANS NEED FOR FINANCIAL AID. RELEVANT DATA POINTS IN THE FAST THE APPLICATION BUT AUTOMATICALLY PRE POPULATE CAUCUS APPLICATION MAKING IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THE CALFRESH APPLICATION PROCESS. LASTLY MANY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE SERVED BY THE FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEAL PROGRAM WHILE IN SCHOOL HAVANESE INTEREST IN A SYSTEMS DOES NOT NECESSARILY AND WHEN THEY ENROLL IN COLLEGE. THE WORK GROUP IS EXPLORING MATHIS TO TRANSITION STUDENTS FROM THE BRING REDUCED PRICE MEAL PROGRAM CALFRESH IDEALLY BEFORE THEY EVEN HIGH SCHOOL. COOL STUDENTS APPLY FOR THE PATH THAT HE THAT CAN ENCOURAGE THEM TO APPLY FOR CALFRESH EVEN AT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. EARLY EXPOSURE TO THE CALPERS APPLICATION PROCESS BEFORE A STUDENT EVEN ENROLLED IN COLLEGE MY INCENTIVIZE STUDENTS TO STAY ENGAGED EVEN WHEN THE STUDENT ELIGIBILITY WILL TAKE SEVEN. THE SHORT TERM STRATEGY FOR THE WORKGROUP HAS IDENTIFIED WILL HOPEFULLY PROVIDE INSIGHT ON HOW THE STATE CAN MAXIMIZE COLLAGEN INVOLVEMENT IN CONTRAST WITHIN THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK A FEDERAL AND STATE SAMPLES. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEDERAL RULES FOR SNAP ELIGIBILITY PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO COLLEGE STUDENT ELIGIBILITY FOR THE REASONS THAT ALEXIS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. THIS BRINGS ME TO THE LONG TERM STRATEGIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED WHICH INVOLVED ADVOCACY AT THE CONGRESSIONAL LEVEL. ONE PRIORITY FOR THE WORKGROUP IS TO SEE THE TEMPORARY EXPANSION OF STUDENT ELIGIBILITY RELATED TO ZERO EST STATUS AND WORK STUDY POSITION MADE PERMANENT. TO TAKE A STEP EVEN A STEP FURTHER THE WORK GROUP ADVOCATES FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE FEDERAL STUDENT ELIGIBILITY MORE EARLY. ELIGIBILITY WILL PREVENT UNNECESSARY ELIGIBILITY MINISTRY TO BARRIER THAT PREVENTS STUDENTS FROM THE SCHOOL A SERVICE THAT THEY NEED. GIVEN THE- RIGHT THE STUDENTS ARCS NATIONWIDE ELIMINATION OF THE SNAPS ELIGIBILITY WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE COOPERATION WOMAN EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS ALLOW MANY STUDENTS TO QUALIFY. FURTHERMORE THE COMMISSION ENVISIONS BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE A STUDENT'S PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR CONTRAST USING INFORMATION FROM THE FACT THAT WITHOUT REQUIRING STUDENTS TO GO THROUGH AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN SOME APPLICATION OR INTERVIEW PROCESS. COLLECTS DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND COULD ACT AS A PROXY GERMAN NEED FOR OTHER FEDERAL BENEFITS LIKE FRESH. RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE STUDENT TO AGAIN PROVE THEY HAVE FINANCIAL NEED. THE WORK GROUP WILLCONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ADVOCATE FOR THESE CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES THE STUDENTS ARE FACING PARTICULARLY IN MEXICO BUT NINETEEN CRISIS ARE DRIVING THE PROGRESS OF THE WORKER. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT EXAMINE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE SUDENT ENROLLMENT AND HOW FRESH BECAUSE AS MENTIONED EARLIER THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE BUT NOT APPLYING. WE WILL BE RELEASING A REPORT SUMMARISING OUR FINDINGSAND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS LATER THIS SPRING I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE EFF AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT THE COMMISSION CONNECT US WITH IMPORTANT CALFRESH EFFORTS. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND I JUST I DIDN'T QUITE FRAME THIS ISSUE BEFORE SO THERE IS NO BUDGET PROPOSAL RELATED TO CALFRESH FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS. THIS IS JUST A LINGERING ISSUE THAT IS YOU KNOW DEBATED IN THE- SOCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE IN THE HIGHER COMMITTEE AND WE DO KNOW THAT. TWO THINGS FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO. GET FINANCIAL AID BY DEFINITION ARE LOW INCOME. AND THESE REPORTS OVER AND OVER TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD INSECURITY AT OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND SO. THEY SHOULDN'T BE THIS COMPLICATED I THINK THE THING THAT DISTRICTS TRACKS IN THE MOST IS THAT. THE STUDENTS WHEN THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY GET- THEY GET FREE LUNCH AT- AT HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN THEY GO TO COLLEGE THEY HAVE THE SAME INCOME AND IT'S LIKE. THE INQUISITION TO GET THEM TO FILL OUT THE FORMS TO GET CALFRESH YOU RETHINK THE STATE COMMISSION FORMS ARE COMPLICATED THIS IS WAY MORE COMPLICATED SO. WE WANTED TO JUST AGENDA IS THIS TO LOOK AT SOME OPTIONS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS AND- THERE'S JUST NOT ONE EASY THING THERE'S QUITE A FEW THINGS THAT THAT WE CAN DO- I KNOW THAT EVERY YEAR PEOPLE AUTHOR BILLS ON THIS TOPIC AND- WE SEEM TO. NOT BE MAKING MUCH PROGRESS ON THIS AND IT'S VERY VERY FRUSTRATING AND SO I WE WOULD JUST WANTED TO BRAINSTORM TO SEE IF THERE ARE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO- TO MAKE IT EASIER- CERTAINLY THIS THIS WE KNOW THERE'S FEDERAL MONEY WOULD LEAVE ON THE TABLE- THE OF THESE MONIES HELPS. AGRICULTURE HELPS YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS AS WELL. SO- WITH ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MR MEDINA YEAH. NO BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAUSE YOU. DEFINITELY CORRECTED THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT. ABOUT IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND A LOT OF FRUSTRATION. THE STUDENTS NOT BEING ABLE TO. ACCESS CALFRESH. SO JUST A QUICK QUESTION- A PRESENTATION THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE COUNTY. AND C. SACK. TO COLLABORATE WITH WITH EACH OTHER. TO IMPLEMENT THESE REFORMS IF YOU COULD JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON ON THOSE CHALLENGES PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA. FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION'S PERSPECTIVE- THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND WORKING WITH THE COUNTY- HOW FRESH OFF WITHIN THE VERIFY STUDENT ELIGIBILITY OUT WE HAVE STUDENT PRIVACY ISSUES TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF SHARING STUDENT DATA OUT WITH COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS. SO WE HAVE TO GET PERMISSION FROM STUDENTS TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION. I WILL LIKE I MENTIONED WE ARE AT THE WORKGROUP EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DATA SHARING. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME EXISTING LOCALIZED EFFORTS BETWEEN- LOCAL CAMPUSES ROUTE FOR EXAMPLE WITH BASIC NEEDS CENTERS THAT ARE WORKING WITH THEIR COUNTY OFFICES TO- JUST ABOUT FIVE THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. OUT WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW THOSE EFFORTS CAN BE REPLICATED STATEWIDE- BECAUSE- WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT STUDENTS ARE LOW INCOME OR THAT THEY ARE QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTION. IS ON THE BACK AND NOT ON THE STUDENTS FIRST RESPONSIBILITY OR PART BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE APPLICATION PROCESS EXPONENTIALLY MORE CALM COMPLICATED FIRST STUDENT. AT SO THERE IS A LOT OF CHALLENGES- AND I MENTIONED WILL BE PUBLISHING REPORT LATER THIS SPRING THAT KIND OF SUMMARIZING THE BARRIERS JOHN JAY THEN HOW AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO OVERCOME. I ALSO TURNED IT OVER TO ALEXIS WHO CAN PROBABLY. SPEAK MORE TO THE COUNTY CLASS. SO THANK YOU MELISSA YOU KNOW I WHAT I WILL IS THAT OFTEN WE KIND. BY GIG RULES- WE ARE FEDERAL PROGRAM SO ME GET YOU IN AND- WE WOULD LOVE TO USE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY HOUSEHOLD ON THE FACTS THAT DETERMINE HOW FASHIONABLE DEBILITY NOT ONLY WOULD THERE BE AN EXCHANGE OF DATA BUT WE HAVE TO THINK THROUGH. HOW WE DETERMINE CALIFORNIA ELIGIBILITY BASED ON THE MOST RECENT THIRTY DAYS OF INCOME INFORMATION WHERE ARE THE FACTS THAT REFLECT THE INCOME FROM THE PAST AND SO THERE ARE- CHALLENGES NOT ALL OF THEM ARE INSURMOUNTABLE. UP MANY ARE AROUND KIND OF THE LOGISTICS OF BEING LIKE SKATE ASSURING OTHERS ARE WORKING WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM RULES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE DETERMINING. ELIGIBILITY ACCURATELY. THANK YOU. MR LEE THANK YOU SEE I AM A PRIEST THAT C. SECTORS ELEVATING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT STUDENT BASIC NEEDS TO THIS COMMITTEE IT'S DEFINITELY A LONG STANDING ISSUE WITHIN ALL OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS SEGMENTS YOU KNOW EVEN BACK WHEN I WAS A DAVIS THESE BARRIERS WERE SO HIGH THAT THAT STUDENTS M. AND USING THEIR PRIVATE MONEY ANDERSON FEES WOULD CREATE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEED RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THESE PRO THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE LOBBYING FOR STATE FUNDS IF WE SAID WE DO IT THEMSELVES STUDENTS OFTEN TAX THEMSELVES JUST TO PROVIDE THESERVICES FOR OTHER STUDENTS. AND IN EFFECT A LOT OF CAMPUSES YOU KNOW PROVIDED FREE FOOD ESSENTIALLY BASED ON IF YOU NEED ARE NOT BASED ON YOUR OWN INTEGRITY IS COMPLETELY ANONYMIZED THERE WASN'T IT OBVIOUS COLLECTED BASICALLY ANONYMIZE IN VERY LOW BARRIER I'M GLAD THAT ALL THESE HE SEES ACT IS WORKING RIGHT NOW TO- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE- OF THE LOWER BARRIERS RIGHT NOW AND MAKING SURE THAT. ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ARE NOTIFIED I THINK THAT IS INCREDIBLE THAT IS A GREAT WORK WE SHOULD BE DOING TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET THAT THE LONG TERM OBVIOUSLY I'M WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO BE ELIMINATING. THE BERRIES ALTOGETHER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. I MEAN I THINK- CALFRESH OR- FOOD INSECURITY OF THE ISSUE ITSELF IS ALMOST. AN EPITOME OF THE OR GOOD METAPHOR. OR ELSE ARE GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROBLEM OR TALK ABOUT HIS COMMITTEE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE GREAT DIALOGUE ABOUT WE HAVE SUCH A COMPLICATED SUCH AND TANGLED SYSTEM OF MEANS TESTING OF YOU HAVE TO BE THIS IF THE THAT YOU FEEL THESE FORMS. AND THAT IS INDICATIVE OF A LARGER PROBLEM WE HAVE THIS COUNTRY RIGHT WILL BE MAKE IT. ALMOST SO DIFFICULT TO BE POOR IN THIS COUNTRY WE MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT ACCESS THE RESOURCES THAT WE COLLECTIVELY PULLED TOGETHER FOR EACH OTHER. AND THIS IS SHOWN VERY CLEARLY JUST IN FOOD INSECURITY RIGHT. I MEAN A LOT OF THESE. PROGRAMS WE CREATED FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS WAS BACK WHEN. THE BUYING POWER OF MINIMUM WAGE IS MUCH STRONGER THAN YOUR BUYING POWER EVEN HIGHER YOUR- PART TIME JOB WITH A MINIMUM WAGE OF A STRONGER. HOUSING COSTS ARE MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE FORMAL AND BOXING KOSTER LEFT ARM. EVERY DAY. SO THESE ARE THE REAL DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE BY SINCE RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY CHOOSE TO HAVE A MALE. BUT THEY CHOOSE TO PAY FOR THE RENT. OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE IS SO DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW SO I'M GLAD THAT HE'S I GUESS TAKING THIS URGENT ACTION RIGHT NOW NOTIFYING IT SO. AWFUL TO BE A PARTNER IN THIS ASPECT BUT I THINK IT IS. ILLUSTRATIVE TO THIS COMMITTEE AND- IN OUR FRUSTRATION ABOUT HOW COMPLICATED THINGS ARE. AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL KEEP UNTANGLING AND SIMPLIFYING STREAMLINING THINGS. IN OUR APPROACH TO MAKE HIGHER EDUCATION FREE AND ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE AND- BE SIMPLIFIED THAT WAY. SO JUST LIKE HOW. OKAY FOR THE QUESTIONS. DISTRESS NOT SO MUCH OF COURSE BUT THE COME THAT OFTENTIMES IS LEGISLATORS WE HEAR THE PRESENTATIONS AND WE ARE 1100% WITH YOU. THIS IS AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS INDICATED WE SHOULD NOT BE TALKING ABOUT TO FOOD AND SECURITY WHEN WE HAVE THE FUNDING TO PROVIDE TO THE ASSISTANCE TO OUR STUDENTS IT STILL EXISTS SO I THINK AS LEGISLATORS AND I APPRECIATED THE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM STRATEGIES THAT THAT WERE INCLUDED IN YOUR PRESENTATION. I THINK THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT YOU THAT WILL BE IN YOUR REPORT WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN HELPING US TO BETTER ADDRESS IT BUT- YOU ALL ARE THE EXPERTS AND WE DO RELY ON. THE SUGGESTIONS THE VERY SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU ALL MAKE BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND YOU HELP US TO PREPARE. TO AUTHOR- LEGISLATION THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AS OPPOSED TO SAYING HERE'S A PROBLEM LET ME INTRODUCE LEGISLATION. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE THE INFORMATION FROM THE EXPERTS ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED. IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ADDRESSING THIS WITH US. YEAH SO AND I WOULD JUST NOTE TO THAT IN THERE ARE A LOT OF REMEDIES HERE AND IT INCLUDES- THEY COUNTY WORKERS THE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AND IT AND IT HAS MR LEE NOTED TO INCLUDES THE SCHOOLS TO THE SYSTEMS NEEDED TO HAVE TO HELP OUT BUT- YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER DOING IS CERTAINLY THAT. THE DATA SHARING IS A PIECE THAT WE SHOULD STEP UP AND DO BUT- YOU KNOW WHAT WE HEARD FROM OUR LA ON FINANCE AT. THAT THIS BUDGET IS NOT YOU KNOW BLOOMING FOR ONGOING YEARS BUT THERE IS POTENTIAL ONE TIME- REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES THIS YEAR SO POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW WE SHOULD COME BACK AND LOOK AT. WHAT IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING AND- MAYBE DO A- TOP UP PILOT AND WORK AND SPEND SPEND THE MONEY OVER THREE YEARS. AND FOCUS AND SEE IF IT WORKS HAVING MORE- WORKERS IN SOME OF THESE SOME OF THE COUNTIES TO WORK IN THIRTEEN COLLEGE. CAMPUS SETTINGS- BUT THE NEED IS NOT GOING AWAY. AND YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING. UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT WORKING ITSELF. AGAIN THIS IS AN INFORMATION LINE THANK YOU FOR THEIR PRESENTATION AND WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER VITAS. I'LL BE BRIEF SO I AM DID THE COVERT NINETEEN RELIEF BILL PASSED BY CONGRESS IN DECEMBER. STREAMLINED CALFRESH BENEFITS ELIGIBILITY FOR ANY POPULATIONS BESIDES COLLEGE STUDENTS. I CAN TAKE THAT THIS IS A LEXUS- THE RELIEF PACKAGE THAT WAS SIGNED IN DECEMBER- HAD A HANDFUL OF CHANGES RELATED TO SNAP THIS WAS THE ONLY. EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY ADDS THE USDA HAS DESCRIBED SO I'M EARLIER ON IN CALIFORNIA HAD ASKED TO LEAVE THIS WORLD IN RESPONSE TO THE CONDEMNING I'M U. S. NEWS RESPONSE WAS THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT AND SO IT DID TAKE ME AN ACT OF CONGRESS AND SO WHAT WE SAW WAS NOT A BELIEVER OF THE RULE. BUT AN EXPANSION SHOULD BE TO YOU POPULATIONS BUT YES THAT THAT IS. THE ONLY GROUP IN THE RELEASED BACK THAT- SAW A CHANGE. IN ELIGIBILITY POLICY. THANK FOR THE FOR THAT CARE THERE AT THEN I DO WANT TO SAY pTHAT WE RALLY LOOK AT. WHY THEY'RE SUCH A GREAT NEED. AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS GREAT NEED WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT. THE FORD ABILITY CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THE HIGH COST OF TAXES THE HIGH COST OF LIVING THAT ARE DRIVING OUR FAMILIES TO MOVE OUT OF THE STATE. AND THESE ARE BROADER ISSUES THAT ARE A PRIORITY FOR ME AT LEAST I THINK A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE- BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR STUDENTS FOR FAMILIES AND THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO BE PRIORITIZING. TO REDUCE THE COST OF LIVING FOR CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN THIS IS OUR FINAL ISSUE BEFORE WE GET TO PUBLIC COMMENTS THIS IS A REPORT FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND THAT THE FIX FINANCIAL AID COALITION- MAINLY OF STUDENTS- TALKING ABOUT WAYS HOW WE CAN MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE OUR CAL GRANT- SYSTEM AND THIS GOES TO ALL THESE AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- ASSEMBLY SUNY COMMISSIONS AND WORKING ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AND MARLENE GARCIA THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS GOING TO- PRESENT TO US NOW THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AGAIN- MCCARTY MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH PROVIDING NEED BEFORE YOU TODAY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION- MY TEAM AND I. ARE MY GARCIA I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY STUDENT AID COMMISSION I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU AS WELL AS A SEPARATE NUMBER MEDINA. FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE OUR COMMISSION IS GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP ALONG WITH SENATOR MADE BACK IN ADVANCING ISSUES THAT IS SO CRITICAL. TO OUR STUDENTS AND THE STATE. I- MUST IGNORE THE ARAB LEADERS. AND REALLY BEING. A STEADFAST IN BRINGING THIS ISSUE. OVER THIS AND THIS CONVERSATION THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT AND CLEAR IN THE CALL FOR. CALIFORNIA TO FIX FINANCIAL AID- BY ADDRESSING THE GROWING BARRIERS OF NON TUITION COSTS AND REMOVING THE ELIGIBILITY RESTRICTIONS ACT SO MANY STUDENTS. OUT OF OUR CURRENT STATE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. BEFORE WE SHOULD BE UPDATE I WANTED TO GIVE YOU I WORK WITH WITH THE LATEST ITERATION OF OUR PROPOSAL. TO MODERNIZE THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS I'D LIKE TO PROVIDES A BACKGROUND FOR NEW MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE NEED FOR TELEGRAPH. CAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT BETTER REFLECTS THE EXPERIENCES OF THE. NEEDS OF TODAY'S STUDENTS. WE ARE PROUD THAT. OFFERS MOST STATE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM IN THE NATION THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS FUNDED BY TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. ANSWERS CLOSER HALF A MILLION STUDENTS ANNUALLY. HOWEVER THE PROGRAM HAS EVOLVED OVER THE DECADES IT HAS GROWN MORE COMPLEX AT LEAST CRITICAL GAPS IN CERTAIN STUDENTS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING THE BASIC NEEDS SUPPORT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. QUITE A BIT THIS MORNING. THE OUTBREAK OF COPING. OUR STUDENTS WORRIES TO COVER THE BASIC NEEDS FOOD HOUSING NOW TECHNOLOGY PARKS AND TRANSPORTATION. AND IN THE MOST RECENT YEARS THAT IT COMBINES SAID ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF COLLEGE. IN COMBINATION BALANCING WORK AND STUDIES WAS OUR BIGGEST CONCERN. IN WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC MINISTER ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM THE LOWEST INCOME BACKGROUNDS ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER THE COST OF COLLEGES BEYOND REACH. AND THESE ARE THE STUDENTS WHO ARE MOST AT RISK OF DROPPING OUT OR NEVER STARTED COLLEGE TO BEGIN WITH AND WE STARTED TO SEE SOME OF THE CRIMES IN OCCUPATIONS AT VARIOUS. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. BUT AT THE TIME THE STATE NEEDS MORE HIGH SKILLED COVERED STUDENTS IN THE WORK FORCE TO TURN THIS ECONOMY AROUND. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE A WHOLE GENERATION OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. BECAUSE THE COST IS PROHIBITED IN THE EXPENSE THAT. SO IF YOU'RE OUT OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS NOTED THE CONVERSATION AROUND REMOVING ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS OF BETTER SUPPORTING STUDENT NEEDS ARE NOT NEW. BUT GIVEN THE INCREASING COST OF ATTENDANCE AND THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA THESE PROBLEMS HAVE YOU REACHED OUT TODAY TO CREATING MAJOR BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS TO COMPLETE COLLEGE. SO OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATURE LED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY MEDINA AS WELL AS SENATOR LEYVA INTRODUCE CAL GRANT REGISTRATION AND THEN ASK THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO LEAD A WORKGROUP IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN. TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL FOR MODERNIZING THE TELEGRAPH PROGRAM TO MORE EQUITABLY SERVE TODAY STUDENTS. TO THE COMMISSION WORK WITH ALL THE MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR RESTRUCTURING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS BASED ON A SET OF GOALS. AND AFTER MONTHS OF WORKING CONSULTATION WILL WORK WITH SUBMITTED THE CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION PROPOSAL AN EQUITY FRAMEWORK FOR THE. FUTURE ON MARCH SIXTH. AND THEN OF COURSE IT GETS BUT YOU'RE OF A THE THAT'S A PRIORITY THAT ARE DRESSED IN EQUITY. NUMBER IT'S SIMPLIFIED INSTREAM THE VERY. SO PROGRAMS GRANT PROGRAMS INTO TO PROBE HELP YOU HELP WRAP FOR. SUPPORT FOR BASIC NEW BYE REX YOU GOT RECOGNIZE NON TUITION COSTS NOT JUST TUITION CLASS. IT MAKES FINANCIAL AID MORE EQUITABLE BY REMOVING NUMEROUS BARRIERS SUCH AS AGE TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL R. G. COMMUNITIES- SO THAT STUDENTS CAN MORE EASILY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND IT ALSO REDUCES THE LEVELS OF DEBT INCURRED BY STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL AID GRANTS. AND THEN LASTLY REALLY IMPORTANTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE LEVERAGE ACCORDING THE OF STATE AND INSTEAD EIGHT TO MORE CALM. AND EFFECTIVELY SERVED IN THE ACTIONS OF THE STUDENTS SO WE LOOK AT ALL THESE PIECES COME TOGETHER TO MEET THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE NOT JUST TOOLS. SO THIS EQUITY FRAMEWORK PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE AND SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO REMOVE THE VEHICLE EQUITIES CURRENTLY BAKED INTO THE SYSTEM. WHICH LARGELY BEING SOME OF OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS ARE OUT OF THE PROGRAM WHO TYPICALLY DO ATTEND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ONE OF THE KEY DISPARITIES AS YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THIS MORNING THIS MORNING. ONE OF THE KEY. THAT THIS PLANET TENDS TO ADDRESS IS THIS YEAR LIMITATION OF THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS AS NOTED EARLIER ONLY ONE IN SEVEN STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO FINANCIALLY ACTUALLY GET AN AWARD. AT MANY OF THE STUDENTS IN FACT THAT TEN PEOPLE COLLEGES SO THIS LOTTERY SYSTEM THAT LEAVES THE MAJORITY OF HIGH NEED STUDENTS WITH NOTHING. IS NOT WORKING FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR STUDENTS WHO COULD OTHERWISE PERSISTENCE. IT'S EVEN CALLED. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WHILE THE PLAN TO BREEDERS OF FOR BASE NEEDS FOR STUDENTS THE LOWEST INCOME. BUT AND- APRIL BY ASKING THAT. TO HELPING LOW AND MIDDLE CLASS. FAMILIES WHO THE MIDDLE CLASS- IN SUPPORTING THEM AND GETTING FINANCIAL AID. THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WHAT IT DOESN'T GET BETTER QUINCES THAT TO REALLY BUILD. OFF OF A WEIRD CAL GRANT AND SOFT. SO WE WILL SHARE YOU TODAY. THE SAME PRIORITIES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY REPORT AS WELL AS OUR EFFORTS WITH OPTIONS THAT REFLECT FUNDS AVAILABLE AS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY APPROPRIATIONS. AND HELP THESE NEW INVESTMENTS CAN AND HOW YOU INVESTMENTS IN MEANINGFUL MEANINGFUL WE RAISE THE DISPARITIES. INSERTED ALL STUDENTS WITH. LAST THREE YOU KNOW THE FEDS HAVE ADOPTED SIGNIFICANT NEW CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY INCREASE NUMBER CAL GRANT STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR PELL GRANTS THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR OUR STUDENTS. PARAGRAPHS WILL OBVIOUSLY DRAW DOWN MORE FEDERAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT STUDENT BASIC NEEDS ARE RELYING LESS ON THE STATE TO PROVIDE FOR ALL OF CITIZENS. WELL MANY OF THE FEDERAL DETAILS ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED THE C. SEX STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING. TO ANALYZE ALL THE DATA AND WORKING WITH NATIONAL EXPERTS TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE CHANGES AND WHAT THEY NEED FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AFTER CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION. SO I WILL PARTS. AND TURNS YOU AND WESTERN QUESTIONS I WILL TURN THE PRESENTATION OVER TO JAKE PRIMERICA R. C. SECTOR RECORD GOVERNMENT EX EXTERNAL RELATIONS WALK YOU THROUGH THE MAJOR PROVISIONS. OF THE CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION PROPOSAL. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARCIA AND I'LL BE SHARING MY SCREEN- NOW WITH THE WALL AS THEY BEGIN TO PROTECT HERE ON OUR I'LL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK- SO YOU SHOULD HOPEFULLY NOW THESE MYSTIFIED- FOR OUR PROPOSED CAL GRANT CHU AWARD- WORK AGAIN. THIS IS AN AWARD THAT WOULD REFLECT THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY CALL STUDENTS. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE PROMISE GRANT FORMALLY PARTNERS WAIVER ALREADY PROVIDES TUITION COVERAGE FOR OVER 40% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER THERE'S VERY LITTLE AID FOR COMMUNITY CALL STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS AND AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AFTER GARCIA NOTED VERY FEW OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. STUDENTS TO MEET RECEIVED A TELEGRAM TODAY. WE WOULD PROPOSE THE DEKALB TO ALL L. COMMUTE COLLEGE STUDENTS. WITH A ZERO EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION THE MOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENTS IDENTIFIED BY OUR EIGHT APPLICATIONS. WITH THIS TYPE IN FOR THEIR NON TUITION COSTS. THIS WOULD ELIMINATE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS BASED ON A STUDENT'S AGE FOR THEIR TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. AND I'M TRYING TO SERVE ADULT LEARNERS WE WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR GPA VERIFICATION. I SECURING HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT CAN BECOME A BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR THE STUDENTS. AND YOU NEED PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WOULD ALSO ALLOW US TO SET AN APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR THAT SEPTEMBER SECOND. FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHEAP. RELATIVE TO OUR OTHER AID PROGRAMS WHICH CURRENTLY- HAVE A STATE PARTY DEADLINE FOR MARCH SECOND. FOR ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS. THIS WOULD REFLECT THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO STUDENTS WITHOUT THE EARLIER ADMISSIONS DEADLINES THAT WE SEE IN OTHER SEGMENTS. ALTOGETHER IN DOING THIS WE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANT YOU. BY MORE THAN DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANT AWARD FROM HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR. FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS I TO HOPE TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN JUST ONE APPLICATION HERE. ON THIS SLIDE WE LAY OUT PROJECTIONS FOR PUBLIC AID COULD BE PROVIDED TO STUDENTS BASED ON AVAILABLE FUNDS. TODAY APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND CAL GRANT. COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE RECIPIENTS EACH YEAR. WITH THOSEPHONES WE COULD OFFER ALL ZERO ESE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH A STIPEND OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AND THAT NUMBER- WE'VE ESTIMATED BASED ON. HISTORICAL DATA ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WERE PAID AN AWARD WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PAID RATES EARLIER AND WE'VE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE INVOLVED PART TIME RATHER THAN FULL TIME. AND WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE FULL I'M MORE. THE CURRENT CAL BE ACCESSIBLE ONLY NON. STUDENTS AWARD- PROVIDES ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SIX DOLLARS ACCURATE ACCOUNT FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDED BY THE COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT REVENUE. TO MAINTAIN IN A WORD OF THAT SIZE WILL ALSO SERVING TO INCREASE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT ELIGIBLE AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND ONGOING FUNDS. AND YOU'LL SEE IN THE BELOW ROW WE'VE ALSO- CONTENDED BY THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR REWARD TO ALL OF THE ZERO YES THE STUDENTS. AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WE REFERENCED. THIS FIVE TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS YES THE- IT OUTLINES WITH THE ELIGIBILITY CUTOFF POINT FOR THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL PROGRAMS SERVING LOW INCOME STUDENTS- AND WE'VE OUTLINED THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR CALTRAIN TO. BEYOND THE ZERO C. MARK DELANEY ELIGIBILITY FOR THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM YES HE CUT OFF. SO I'M ON THE SIXTH WHY I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME DATA POINTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE ADDENDUM TO THAT MARCH TOLERATE REPORT A MODERNIZATION REPORT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARCIA- ACTION SO IN THOSE MATERIALS THAT I BELIEVE MEMBERS SHOULD ALREADY HAVE- THESE ARE- DATA POINTS. FROM THE LAST PAGE OF THAT ADDENDUM REPORT- WHERE WE- I LIKE SOME OF THE KEY CHANGES THAT WE WOULD SEE AND THE PROFILE OF RECIPIENTS FOR STATE AID UNDER CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION RELATIVE TO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER TODAY. AND WHAT I WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO IS THAT RELATIVE TODAY'S RECIPIENTS STUDENTS WOULD RECEIVE A PELL GRANT TO AWARD WOULD BE LOWER INCOME. HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEM WOULD BE FIRST GOING CALLED FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GOING STUDENTS. THEY WOULD BE OLDER ON AVERAGE THAN TODAY'S RECIPIENTS AND A GREATER SHARE OF THEM WOULD BE STUDENT PARENTS AND ACTUALLY A THREE TIME OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ELIGIBLE NEARLY REAL TIME. WILL BE STUDENT PARENTS. HERE WE'VE ALSO- PULLED OUT SOME HIGH FROM THE- AGAIN AND APPENDIX TO VIEW THEM BUT- AND WE WANTED TO FLAG FOR YOU SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE REPRESENTATION. OF STUDENT RECIPIENTS UNDER THE PROPOSED CAL GRANT TO RELATIVE TO TODAY'S MODEL SO IN THIS TOP ROW YOU SEE THE PERCENTAGE SHARE OF STUDENT- POPULATIONS. BASED ON THE CURRENT CAL GRANT THAT CAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER AND HERE IN THE PROPOSAL HELLO YOU SEE THE SHARE OF STUDENT POPULATIONS BASED ON. THE PROPOSED CAL GRANT TO. BUSINESS ELIGIBLE COLUMN REPRESENTS STUDENTS WORKING BROUGHT IN TO THE STATE AID A PROGRAM AND ARE BEING MADE ELIGIBLE HI THIS PROPOSAL. AND YOU SEE THE PERCENT FOR EACH VERY STUDENT POPULATION I WILL I THANK EACH PERCENTAGE POINT HERE BUT I DO WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO. WHAT THOSE PERCENTAGES TRANSLATES TO AN ACTUAL NUMBERS OF STUDENTS TO BECOME ELIGIBLE AND HERE YOU SEE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALONE I'M MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. LATINO STUDENTS TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANT AWARD- UNDER DISCOGRAPHY. TWO THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. SO I WANT TO ALSO SPEAK TO. THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES WOULD BE ON THE STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN GRANT PROGRAMS EVEN SPEAKING TODAY JUST SOME OF THOSE ENHANCE ACCESS AWARDS THAT. RECIPIENTS THOSE WHO ALREADY RECEIVE A PELL GRANT- BENEFIT FROM AND IF THEY IF THEY FIT BUT ST PARENT ELIGIBILITY PROFILE OR IN THE PROPOSAL- DISCUSSED EARLIER TO OUR FOSTER YOUTH STUDENTS- WHAT WE PROPOSE HERE IS THAT ALL OF OUR ZERO E. IF THE STUDENT PARENTS ATTENDING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CSU OR UC WOULD RECEIVE- STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN GRANT AWARD- THESE ARE THE SAME INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM TODAY. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WE ANTICIPATE WOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE PROMISE GRANT TO COVER THEIR TUITION AND FEES AND STUDENT PARENTS WOULD RECEIVE THIS ENHANCED. STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN GRANT RATHER THAN THE CAL GRANT TO FOR THEIR NON TUITION COSTS. WHEREAS AT THE YOU SEEM TO SEE IF YOU WERE THE CULPRIT FOR THAT WE'LL DISCUSS MOMENTARILY WOULD COVER TUITION AND FEES STUDENT PARENTS OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES WOULD RECEIVE A STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN GRANT. IN ADDITION ABOUT TUITION FEES COVERAGE. AND SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SAW WITH THE TELEGRAM TO. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL COULD YOU REMOVE THOSE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS NEARLY TWICE AS MANY ARE EMPLOYING MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY THAT SHOULD SAY STUDENT PARENTS BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANT AWARD AND WE GO FROM TWENTY SIX JUST OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS PARENTS ELIGIBLE. UNDER TODAY'S A CALTRANS IS DONE TO OVER. SIXTY THOUSAND UNDER CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION. AND AS WE DID THE CAL TO. ON THIS SLIDE WE LAY OUT- AWARD AMOUNT BE PULSE FOR THE INCREASE BASIS STUDENT PARA RECIPIENTS. USE ONLY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IT'S CURRENTLY THAT- STATUTORY PROGRAM FUNDING CAP FOR THIS PROGRAM. SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL OF THOSE- OR OFFER ALL OF THOSE SIXTY THOUSAND STUDENTS BUT THE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR. I'M AWARD AMOUNT- USING THAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU SEE HERE THAT WE'VE ALSO IDENTIFIED THE FUNDS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED ON GOING IF YOU WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE MAXIMUM AWARD IT'S AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS THAT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THERE'S AND HERE WE'VE ALSO. INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE FOR THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH EXTENDING. INSTITUTIONAL ELIGIBILITY FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AND GOING BEYOND THE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES- THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM TODAY. AND AGAIN WE'VE ALSO INCLUDED ESTIMATES FOR THE FUNDS REQUIRED TO EXTEND ELIGIBILITY FOR THE BENEFIT BEYOND- ZERO EST DISTANCE YOU MIGHT HAPPEN IF THE THAT QUALIFIES THEM FOR THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. NOW HERE ALL SHIPS- THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE CAL GRANT FOR PROGRAM WOULD SERVE STUDENTS OUT ARE YOU SEE ARE CSU AND ARE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA- AND WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IT'S MODEL WHAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE- BASED ON THE TWO POINT ONE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IT'S CURRENTLY ALLOCATED. TO STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE SECTORS- WE WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER A STUDENTS WITH AN EST THAT QUALIFIED FOR THE PROGRAM WOULD HELP GRANT FOR REWARD IT WOULD ACTUALLY JUST TAKE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING ABOVE THAT TWO POINT ONE FOUR. BILLION WHICH IS A OF A SMALL NUMBER IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT BROADER- TWO POINT ONE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION- AND AS WE- CHAIRED EARLIER WE AGAIN PROPOSED ELIMINATING THE AGE AT THE TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS THAT EXIST ON OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAMS TODAY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE DIFFERENT GPA MINIMUMS DEPENDING ON THE PROGRAM I'M FOR WHICH YOU'RE ELIGIBLE AND WE WOULD CONSOLIDATE AND STREAMLINE BOWS DOWN. TO TWO POINT OH GPA MINIMUM. THE CAL GRANT FOR WHAT CAN TO TUITION FEES DID YOU SEE OR IF YOU WHILE MAINTAINING THE EXISTING AWARD AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED AT PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE A CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD- SO INSTEAD WE PROPOSE THAT INSTITUTIONALLY PROVIDES ZERO YES THE STUDENTS WITH A STIPEND TO SUPPORT THEIR BASIC NEEDS. M. ALTOGETHER BY LIMITING VISA ELIGIBILITY BEARERS IN CONVERTING TO TUITION COVERAGE AWARDS WE COULD OFFER FORTY THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS WITH THE CAL GRANT FOR AWARD RELATIVE TO BILLS ELIGIBLE UNDER TODAY'S REQUIREMENTS. EARLIER WE WANT TO PULL OUT SOME KEY CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF RECIPIENTS UNDER THE CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK SO RELATIVE TO PROCEED STUDENTS WERE RECEIVING OKAY. TODAY THOSE WHO WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE CAL GRANT FOR WOULD BE LOWER INCOME UP A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEM WOULD BE INDEPENDENT STUDENTS AND NOT A DEPENDENCE LISTED UNDER FASTER- UNDER THEIR THEIR PARENTS- TAX FILING- MAYBE OLDER THAN RECIPIENTS TODAY. AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE. OF THEM WOULD BE STUDENT PARENTS. AND AGAIN WE WANTED TO SHARE- WHAT THE IMPACTS ON THE REPRESENTATION OF CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS WOULD LOOK LIKE AND WILL NOT AS PRONOUNCED WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT- SHIFT TOWARDS GREATER INCLUSION PARTICULARLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND ARE LOOKING OF STUDENTS. MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM I CAN BE BRIEF ON THIS SLIDE BECAUSE WE REALLY AS EXECUTIVE COURSE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARCIA NOTED WOULD PROPOSE CONFORMING CHANGES SO THAT. THIS PROGRAM WOULD PICK OFF PICK UP RIGHT WHERE THE CULPRIT FOR ELIGIBILITY ENDS I'M AND THAT WE WOULD AS WE MOVE FROM INCOME ASSET FEELINGS ON OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE WOULD DO THE SAME FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. AND SHIPPED BACK TO A BASIS ON EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION FOR ELIGIBILITY- SUCH THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A PERCENTAGE OF TUITION COVERAGE JUST UNITS BASED ON THEIR EFC. I'M AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME VALUABLE- IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE TO ADMINISTRATION ON THIS PROGRAM IN FUNCTIONS OF THE LAST DOLLAR PROGRAM WHICH MEANS WE'RE TRACKING STUDENT FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ACADEMIC YEAR. AND ACTUALLY CREATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT- IN THE AUGUST FOLLOWING AN ACADEMIC YEAR STUDENTS EITHER AWARD REDUCED SO WE WOULD PROPOSE- PROVIDING A DEFINED. PERCENTAGE AT THE START OF THE YEAR. I MENTIONED EARLIER THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL AID- THAT WE SEE UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK- AND- WHAT WE WOULD AGAIN PROPOSES THAT ZERO ESE STUDENTS- AND ROLLED. OUT ORG UNIVERSITIES BE ELIGIBLE FOR INSTITUTIONAL AID TO SUPPORT THEIR BASIC NEEDS. THIS IS POSSIBLE IN PART BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT INSTITUTIONAL AID RESOURCES PARTICULARLY AT THE CSU ARE BEING UTILIZED TO FILL HOLES IN THE COVERAGE OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS TODAY. THAT ARE CREATED BY ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE- NATIONAL NEED. SO I THINK DOLLARS BECOME FREED UP WE PROPOSE THAT THOSE GO TOWARDS SUPPORTING BASIC NEEDS FOR OUR MOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENTS. AND YOU SEE HERE WE HAVE SOME OPTIONS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION REPUBLICAN OPERATIONALIZE THIS- EXPECTATION INCLUDING ANNUAL REPORTING OR REQUIREMENT THAT INSTITUTIONS ADOPT AND PUBLICIZE. POLICIES ON USE OF INSTITUTIONAL. AND I ON THIS CHART WE LAY OUT. WE KNOW THAT WE'VE THROWN A LOT AT YOU SO FAR AND HAS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY THIS IS A COMPLICATED SYSTEM THAT WE ADMINISTER- FOR CAL GRANT PROGRAMS OR TODAY'S REQUIREMENTS. SO WE WANTED TO LAY IT OUT BEACH WILL BE WHAT THIS WOULD ALL LOOK LIKE UNDERDEVELOPMENT EQUITY FRAMEWORK. AND HOW THESE PROGRAMS WOULD FIT TOGETHER TO PROVIDE A MORE COHESIVE AND COORDINATED APPROACH TO COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. SO THESE LINES HERE REPRESENT THE EFCC CUT OFF THAT WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT THIS LINE DESIGNATES ZERO EST POPULATION WHICH HAS A MEDIAN INCOME OF ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THEY'RE QUITE- FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE. AND FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THE PROMISE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD CONTINUE TO COVER TUITION FEES FOR STUDENTS WITH THIS EXCEPT BY NANCIAL NEED. WHILE THE FEDERAL PELL GRANTS AS WELL AS A STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN GRANT OR CAL GRANT YOU AWARD WOULD BE pAVAILABLE TO HELP SUPPORT THEM IN COVERING THEIR BASIC NEEDS EXPENSES. AND MOVING BEYOND THE ZERO ESE- CUT OFF POINT. THE STUDENTS WOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A PELL GRANT BUT IT DOES TAPER DOWN AS YOU APPROACH SHOULD BE- FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS EST POINT. ON THE- GIVE THE CSU SIDE IT'S LISTED HERE YOU SEE THAT CULPRIT FOR WOULD COVER TO. AND FEES FOR ALL STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR THAT PELL GRANTS- YES CD. THAT HAS A MEDIAN INCOME OF FIFTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THOSE STUDENTS ALL QUALIFIED FOR A PELL GRANT OF SOME KIND. AND WE PROPOSE THAT ZERO EST STUDENT PARENTS RECEIVE THAT STUDENT PARENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN GRANT AWARD FOR ADDITIONAL NON TUITION. ASSISTANCE INSTITUTIONAL AID WOULD THAT- BE LAYERED OVER- THESE INVESTMENTS TO PROVIDE GREATER SUPPORT FOR BASIC NEEDS FOR ZERO EST STUDENTS. ALL BEYOND ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CALGARY FOR INTEL GRANT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A PERCENTAGE OF TUITION COVERAGE. THE INSTITUTIONAL AID COULD HELP CLOSE THE GAP. AS WE- START TO CONCLUDE HERE JUST A FEW OTHER QUICK NOTES- WE WOULD PROPOSE DAY ANY STUDENT RECEIVING A PELL GRANT UNDER TODAY'S RULES BE GRANDFATHERED INTO THE PROGRAM AND BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE. THEIR EXISTING CAL GRANT UNTIL THEIR ELIGIBILITY WERE TO EXPIRE. I'M THAT DOES COME WITH A ONE TIME TRANSITION COSTS WE CAN SHARE MORE WITH YOU ABOUT THAT THE QUESTIONS. AND DID MODELING- WHAT WOULD BE A POSSIBLE UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK AND WE KEPT FUNDING CONSISTENT. FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED EACH SEGMENT AND WE'VE NOT- PROPOSED ANY SHIFTING OF DOLLARS FROM ONE SEGMENT. TO ANOTHER WHAT YOU SEE HERE. WE DO THINK THERE ARE OTHER- IMPORTANT POLICIES THAT ARE AT THAT YOU CONSIDER AS WE- MOVE FORWARD IN. ADVANCING CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK AND CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION- PARTICULARLY OF NOTE WELL THE CALTRAIN AWARDS AT THE YOU SEE IN THE C. IF YOU ARE CONNECTED TO TUITION. INCREASE AWARDS AND PROGRAM COSTS AS TUITION RATES GO UP THERE IS CURRENTLY NO- MECHANISM FOR OUR ACCESS AWARDS FOR NON TUITION COSTS- TO INCREASE AS THOSE EXPENSES DO AS AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. I'M WITH THE COST OF LIVING- ISSUES FACING OUR STUDENTS- SO WE DO THINK THAT THE GROWTH IN DEXTER OTHER METRIC TO KEEP CAL GRANT TO. AWARD THE CONTRACT WITH NON TUITION COSTS I'M WOULD. HELP ADDRESS THIS INEQUITY IN COULD. ZERO OF THE AWARDS. POWER OVER. SIMILARLY EXTERMINATOR HAS SUPPORTED RESTORATION OF A FORMULA AWARD- FOR GRANTS TO STUDENTS ENROLLED AT A PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BILL ABILITY OF. L. GRANT FOR SUMMER PROGRAMS COULD REALLY BE IMPACTFUL AND HELPING MORE STUDENTS GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS AND GRADUATE ON TIME- WITHOUT REDUCING THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR CAL GRANT ASSISTANCE DURING THE TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC YEAR. SO WE THINK THAT'S ALSO A VERY WORTHWHILE CONSIDERATION. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF OR SEE THAT NOTED THAT- CHANGES TO THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID POLICIES- THAT'LL BE COMING ONLINE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND IT AS SHE NOTED THIS IS REALLY GREAT NEWS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND OUR STATE OF MORE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE A PELL GRANTS MORE STUDENTS WERE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR A PELL GRANT WILL RECEIVE A HIGHER REWARD- IT DOES REQUIRE US TO UPDATE OUR MODELING AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION- BUT THAT BEING SAID. I'M WE DON'T THINK THAT THEY'LL BE ANY- SHIFT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT WE WOULD CHANGE THE FRAMEWORK WE GOT LIKE YEAR OF A CAL GRANT TO AND CAL GRANT FOR AWARD. HOWEVER WE WOULD IMPACT JUST THAT THIS REALLY- FOR OUR POLICY MAKERS CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER HOW DO WE BEST LEVERAGE FEDERAL STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL AID SOURCES IN CONCERT TO MOST. EFFECTIVELY SERVE OUR STUDENTS. SO TECHNICALLY I WON TO LEAVE YOU WITH A WHAT WE GET THE STUDENT COMMISSION E. AS THE KEY OUT. OF THIS TELL IN EQUITY FRAMEWORK AND IT'S A TOP- WE WOULD STREAMLINE CAL GRANT TO BE MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND COMMUNICATED BY EDUCATORS AND COUNSELORS. WE WOULD ALIGN ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE BASED DATE WITH FEDERAL POLICY. WE DON'T LIMIT AB ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS FOR STATE AID THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED STUDENTS FINANCIAL NEED. AND WE CAN TARGET STATE RESOURCES TO THE MOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENTS THAT WERE CERTAIN. NUMBER TANGIBLY AB CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK WOULD YOU'LL HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE RELATIVE CHIU TODAY'S CURRENT CALIBER AND STANDARDS. OUR STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING- AS WE WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER WITH THE TUITION FEE AWARDS- BY OFFERING MORE CAL GRANT FOR AWARDS COVER TUITION COSTS. AND IN OFFERING FORTY THOUSAND MORE CAL GRANT FOR WORKS TO COVER TUITION FEES THAT MEANS FORTY THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS COULD RECEIVE THAT LETTER THAT LETS THEM KNOW THEY'VE RECEIVED A TENANT FUNDED BENEFIT. AND ARE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR CALFRESH. THERE WOULD ALSO BE HIGHER NUMBERS OF STUDENT PARENTS ADULT LEARNERS AND CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT FILERS WHO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR STATE AID UNDER THE CALTRAIN EQUITY FRAMEWORK AND I KNOW THESE ARE ALL STUDENT POPULATIONS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO FIX SUBCOMMITTEE. AND WE WOULD ALSO- CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK- MAKER SYSTEM MORE INCLUSIVE PARTICULARLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO STUDENTS. SO I'M- INCLUDING JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY I KNOW THIS IS A LOT OF INFORMATION BE PROVIDED SO- AFTER YOU HEAR OUR- STUDENT PARTNER OF MR LEWIS SPEAK. A MORE CERTAINLY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND I'LL BE JOINED BY PATRICK PERRY OUR DIRECTOR OF DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH WHO OVERSAW THE DATA MODELING- UNDERLINED THIS PROPOSAL AND CAN HELP ANSWER ANY MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE DATA. THANK YOU. THE STATE. OKAY YEAH. PLEASE PER STATE. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ALL TODAY MY NAME IS JOSH LEWIS I'M A JUNIOR AT UC BERKELEY I'M HONORED TO SERVE AS THE CHAIR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION TO YOUR BEFORE YOU ON BEHALF OF THE FIX FINANCIAL AID COALITION FORMED JUST UNDER THREE YEARS AGO BUT THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION THE STUDENT SENATE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION. TOGETHER REPRESENTING THE STATE'S THREE MILLION STUDENTS OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION EXPONENTIALLY IS ABOUT BRINGING OUR STUDENT LEADERS TOGETHER AROUND COMMON PRINCIPLES FOR FINANCIAL REFORM I'M HERE TO EXPRESS THOSE PRINCIPLES TO YOU ON BEHALF OF OUR THREE ASSOCIATIONS AND TALK ABOUT OUR ASPIRATION FOR REFORM ONE THAT ADDRESSES THE EQUITY AND AFFORDABILITY CAPS FACING THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK YOU FOR THE WORK OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THIS COMMITTEE OUTLINING A STATE BUDGET BLUEPRINT THAT CENTRALIZES STUDENT MATTERS AND PRIORITIES AND FUNDING FOR OUR THREE SEGMENTS AND THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO MEMPHIS WORKING WITH STUDENT LEADERS PARTICULARLY THOSE MOST IMPACTED BY TODAY'S CHALLENGES OR SOMETHING WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR US THIS COMMITTEE DISCUSSES FUNDING FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND EQUITY. SENATE MODERNIZATION OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. THE ELEVEN MONTHS PRESENTED SOME OF THE- INTENSE. CHILD THAT STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE FACED IN RECENT HISTORY. AS AN RA AT UC BERKELEY I WAS OUT OF HOUSING WITHOUT WARNING BY THE BEGINNING OF APRIL. WITH THE LOSS OF MY CAMPUS JOB NO CAMPUS HOUSING OR ACCESS TO MY CAMPUS MEAL PLAN. I WAS FORCED TO MOVE ON. MY ROLE COMMUNITY IN AMADOR COUNTY HAD INCREDIBLY POOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE'RE NOT FOR THE ADVOCACY OF STUDENTS LIKE ME SECURING ACADEMICALLY NANCY. MY AGE ELIGIBILITY WOULD HAVE SUFFERED. I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR THAT MY STORY REPRESENTS THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR STUDENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR. SOME LOSS OF HOUSING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES COMBINED PHILOSOPHY TO ELIGIBILITY. AND ALL OF THE OTHER EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC RESULTED IN AN UNPRECEDENTED BASIC NEEDS INSECURITY. UNABLE TO ACCESS RELIABLE INTERNET STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE COULD NOT BE MAINTAINED. BEARING THE WEIGHT OF EVERYTHING I JUST DESCRIBED STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH SUFFERED GREATLY. AND PERHAPS WORST OF ALL STUDENTS RELYING ON AID DISBURSEMENTS WERE DENIED THAT IT DID BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN LIVING CIRCUMSTANCES. ECONOMIC BARRIERS BEING THROWN UP AT EVERY TURN COULD NOT BE OVERCOME BY THE LEVELS OF EIGHT AND PROGRAMMATIC. RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS. WELL THE PANDEMIC SEARCH EXAM. THE DEEP EQUITIES IN OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEMS. AND PUSH. EQUITIES ARE NOT NEW TO US. FIRST THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE TRULY IN NEED OF FINANCIAL IT HAS ONLY GROWN. AS THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA INCREASE WITH TIME AND WE STRIVE TO MAKE ACCESS TO OUR INSTITUTIONS MORE EQUITABLE. NATURALLY MORE STUDENTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AFFORDED ACCESS ARE DENIED IT BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. FOR THE RELATIVE SIZE OF DIFFERENT POOLS OF H. SHRINK. MORE AND MORE STUENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DEBT FREE HIGHER EDUCATION PATHWAY. THE DECISION THAT STUDENTS APPLYING TO CCC CSU AND UC HAVE TO MAKE. IS WHETHER OR NOT THEIR FAMILIES CAN AFFORD THE SHORT TERM BUT DRAMATIC COSTS OF SEEKING HIGHER EDUCATION. AND THE LONG TERM COSTS OF ITS ASSOCIATED DEBT. BURDEN OF THIS DEBT IS HELP DRASTICALLY DISPROPORTIONATELY WITH BLACK AND BROWN STUDENTS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO SEE ADVERSE EFFECTS. THERE IS A PRESSING NEED FOR STUDENT AID TO BE GRANTED YEAR ROUNDS WERE INCREASINGLY RELYING ON GREATER ACADEMIC AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. FULLY FUNDING OUR STATE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEMS ALL HOPING TO ENSURE A COHESIVE AND HOLISTIC INVESTMENT. INTO FINANCIAL AID FROM OUR INSTITUTIONS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. SECOND THING CAL GRANT PROGRAMS NEEDS TO BE REFORMED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EVER INCREASING TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. BUT STUDENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION FACE. POLITICIAN AND FEAST CERTIFIED AND ECONOMIC OBSTACLE TO MANY STUDENTS. AND MUST CONTINUE TO BE COVERED BY FINANIAL AID. ADDITIONAL COST OF ATTENDANCE PRESENTS AN EQUALLY LARGE IF NOT LARGER HERBAL. PERSONALLY THE ONLY REASON MY NON TUITION COSTS OF ATTENDANCE DO NOT EXCEED MY TUITION. IT'S BECAUSE I WORK AS AN RA TO SECURE HOUSING AND FOOD. ALL TOO FREQUENTLY THESE COSTS ARE ON ANTICIPATED AND IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAN FOR. THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF ATTENDING A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY TO CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING INCLUDING HOUSING FOOD AND OTHER BASIC NEEDS. HOWEVER RECOGNITION OF THE ADDED ECONOMIC PRESSURES OF TRANSPORTATION MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND TEXTBOOKS. TO NAME A FEW IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING. THAT STUDENTS DON'T JUST HAVE THEIR NEEDS MET ON PAPER BY COMPARING TUITION AND FEES. TO A PROPOSED AID PACKAGE BUT ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO AFFORD ATTENDANCE. HOLISTIC REIMAGINING OF THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE OF OUR STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. IS REQUIRED ON AN INSTITUTIONAL AND STATE. LEVEL TO MAKE THIS RECOGNITION HAPPEN. THE CURRENT COVERAGE SYSTEM PRESS A NUMBER ARTISTS. YET REMOVABLE. TO STUDENT HOW THEIR NEEDS. BY SIMPLY NOT A KALRA IT'S NEED TO COMES. THE URGENT NEED TO STREAMLINE THE CAL GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS IS KEENLY FELT. STUDENTS ARE REGULARLY DENIED ACCESS SEATING EIGHTY TWO TO MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF APPLICATION PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROTECT. ACCESS ADDITIONALLY ENSURING THAT THE CULPRIT APPLICATION IS PROPERLY INTEGRATED TO THE APPLICATION PROCESSES. OTHER POOLS OF STATE ESOURCES LIKE CALFRESH WILL MEAN THAT NO STUDENT MISSES OUT ON HELP THEY QUALIFY FOR. THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THE CAL GRANT THEMSELVES REPRESENT A SEEMINGLY ARBITRARILY DENIAL OF ECONOMIC ACCESS AS WELL. RESTRICTIONS TO CALTRAIN ACCESS BASED ON AGE TOTAL TERMS IN ATTENDANCE TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND GPA SERVE TO STOP OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE WISHING TO SEEK HIGHER EDUCATION FOR BEING ABLE TO DO SO. BESIDES EXTENDING TO LIMIT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF STUDENTS RECEIVING AID THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE NEEDLESSLY CONVOLUTED. PRESENTING EVEN ANOTHER LAYER OF INACCESSIBILITY. THIS RESTRICTIONS ALSO CREATES SELF PERPETUATING LOSSES OF EIGHT. I SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHEN I SAY THAT ECONOMIC INSECURITY BECAUSE THAT'S NOT JUST A PERSONAL CHALLENGE BUT AN ACADEMIC ONE. RIGHT TO BE STRIPPED OF MY EIGHT BECAUSE OF THE RESULTS OF THESE ACADEMIC CHALLENGES NOT ONLY WITH MY ABILITY TO FINANCIALLY ACCESS YOU SEE BE THREATENED. BY ECONOMIC MY ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE WOULD CERTAINLY SUFFER AS A RESULT. THESE ARBITRARY METRICS BY WHICH EIGHT ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED NEED TO BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO ADVANCE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO OUR INSTITUTIONS. OF THE COALITION REPRESENTING STUDENTS THE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION WE'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE WITH C. SACK ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CAL RANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND C. SACK TO MEET THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. OF CODE NINETEEN AND REMOVE THE LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA FACED. THANK. YOU AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS IS A AND IN ITEM. THERE IS- COMPANION LEGISLATION THAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M A DENIER ARE WORKING ON BUT THIS IS A BUDGET ISSUE AS WELL REALIZE THAT IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THIS WE WOULD NEED. TO RAMP UP- COMMITMENT IN THE STATE BUDGET SO- IS A MULTI YEAR PROCESS AND FIRST OF ALL MISS MEDINA LIMITED THANK THE STUDENT COMMISSION AND- MARLENE GARCIA AND THAT THE TEAM WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR US FOR SEVERAL YEARS- WE THINK WE HAVE A SOLID PLAN OF WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO A ROAD MAP IS WE SHOW THAT COMMITMENT. TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS- I DO I DO KNOW THAT THE OVERALL PICTURE THIS IS TO HELP. MORE NEEDY STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA- AND I THINK IT'S WITH THE GOAL TO SIMPLIFY IT SO I LIKE. HAVING THAT THE TO IN THE FOR AT FIRST GLANCE YOU LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE FOR NEW CAL GRANT PROGRAMS BUT NOW IT'S FOR ONE FOR TWO YEARS STUDENTS AND ONE FOR. FOR YOUR STUDENTS I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S THAT SIMPLIFIES AS WELL AS WELL AS- THE CORRESPONDING ON MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WHICH I KNOW MY- COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH HAS SOME. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT IN IN IN A FEW MOMENTS BUT- I JUST WANNA KNOW THAT WERE CONTINUE CONTINUALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS ISSUE- TO HOPEFULLY. PUTTING A DOWN PAYMENT. INTO IN IN SPENDING- THE CAL GRANT FINANCIALLY SYSTEM CALIFORNIA. ARE FOCUSING ON ON NON TUITION COSTS I THINK THAT'S THE- AT THE CRUX HERE IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE- FOCUS ON THE REALITY OF THE COLLEGE STUDENTS TODAY. IT'S YOU KNOW. THE CAL GRANT IS A GREAT- SYSTEM WE'VE HAD FOR DECADES HERE WHO MADE ENTITLEMENT TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO. BUT THE COST OF COLLEGE OR ARE GENETICALLY CHANGED BY THE HOUSING COSTS IN TRANSPORTATION IN BOOKS AND- FOOD AND SO FORTH SO THE QUESTION IS VERY DIFFERENT AND SO. ARE OUR VIEW IS- HOW YOU COULD MAKE COLLEGE. MORE AFFORDABLE AND FRANKLY DEBT FREE IN CALIFORNIA SO. THERE'S ANOTHER LIGHT CONVERSATION ABOUT FREE COLLEGE ACROSS OUR NATION BUT- I THINK THE REAL EQUATION IS HOW WE CAN FOCUS ON MAKING IT A DEBT FREE SO. OF COURSE THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES DEPEND ON THEIR INCOME HAVE SOME EXPECTED. THAT CONTRIBUTION COUPLED WITH. FINANCIAL AID FROM THE FEDERAL STATE GOVERNMENT WE REALLY COULD MAKE IT. FEASIBLE FOR STUDENTS TO GRADUATE WITH MINIMAL DEBT AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT. WOULD BE A BIG. BIG WIN HIM CALIFORNIA SO. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BUT WE WANT TO GET. THE THE COMMISSION AS WELL AS THE COALITION OPPORTUNITY TO. TO TESTIFY HERE THIS MORNING- I KNOW- MISTER MEDINA HAD TO STEP OUT FOR A BIT BUT HE WANTED ME TO SHARE THOSE COMMENTS. I MAY COME BACK WITH SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES BUT ALL START OFF WITH- MISTER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PRESENTATIONS AND- TRYING TO BE AS CREATIVE AS POSSIBLE. TO SERVE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND ULTIMATELY ENSURE THEM SUCCESS- AND OUR ECONOMY SUCCESS- JUST MY CONCERNS- YOU HEARD HIM EARLIER WITH REGARD TO THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP FROM THEM COS- HOW WILL THE PROPOSED CHANGES IMPACT THE NUMBER. OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT WHO WOULD BEST BE. PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL AND AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARCIA NOTED IN HER REMARKS- WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO HAVING- CAL GRANT PROGRAMS AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN CONCERT TO SUPPORT. BOTH OUR LOW INCOME AND OUR MIDDLE INCOME UPDATE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES SO. IT'S PRESENTED TO YOU TODAY WE DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY SPECIFIC- EFCC LAME OR CUT OFF POINT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO- IN ORDER TO. GET BACK TO AND IDENTIFY HOW MANY STUDENTS THAN WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AWARD OR ENROLLED AT THE- YOU SEE IN THE CSU- BUT WE WOULD- PROPOSED IT IT BEGIN WHERE THE CAL GRANT FOUR ENDS. TODAY THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP IMPACT FILLING HOLES- FURTHER DOWN THE INCOME LADDER IN FACT THAT ARE CREATED BY THE LACK OF ELIGIBILITY FOR CALIFORNIA WORK THERE'S NO. INCOME FLOOR ON THIS PROGRAM SO TO SPEAK SO- IMPACTED WE WOULD SEE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP DOLLARS BE SHIFTED TO FOCUSING ON THOSE- STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHO. THOUGHT THAT TELEGRAM- CUT OFF POINT AND- ALL MAYBE BECAUSE THERE TO SEE IF MY- COLLEAGUE- PATRICK PERRY I'M HAS ANYTHING PROPONENTS YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE OUR DATA- QUESTION THAT YOU PASSED. THANK YOU JACK UP PATRICK PERRY DIRECTOR PA. RE INTO STUDENICA. SO WORK MAKING A- HUGE PROPOSED CHANGES TO M. C. S. OTHER THAN JUST ALIGNING IT WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR CAL GRANT FOR. ME IN DFAR NUMBER OF MCS TOWARDS- I WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT TO CHANGE FROM WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. MCS THIS LIMITED BASICALLY BY THE AMOUNT OF THE PROGRAM- AND WE- SPLIT IT UP. YOU KNOW STARTING BASED UPON WHERE WHERE IT BEGINS IN THE INCOME LEVEL AND MOVING TO THE RIGHT UNTIL WE EXHAUST ALL THE MONEY. SO I WOULD ANTICIPATE THERE BEING ANY. DRAMATIC CHANGES THE NUMBER OF AWARDS. GREAT THANK YOU. WELL OF THE FEEDBACK I'VE HEARD IS THAT THERE IS I HAVE HEARD CONCERNED THAT THIS IS KIND OF THE SLOW KILL. ARE YOU KNOW AN ATTACK ON THE MISSION OF THE LITTLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP SO- I'LL BE WATCHING THIS CLOSE AND TWO OTHERS WILL. APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK ON T. BUT I THINK IT OUT OF THE GATE DOES STRIKE ME AS A CUT TO THE PROGRAM. OR AN IMPACT IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL SERVE. LISTEN TO THE PERSPECTIVE I HAVE AS CALIFORNIA DOES LITTLE VERY LITTLE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THIS IS ONE PROGRAM. ACTUALLY DOES HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS. SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE SUSTAIN IT. AND THAT IT NOT BE TAMPED DOWN- CUT. OR OR JUST- YOU KNOW. NOT MEET ITS ORIGINAL INTENT OR MISSION. SO I THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK ON THAT I'LL BE WATCHING THIS ISSUE AND OTHERS WILL. VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE I THINK THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP SOMETHING WE NEED TO EXPAND ON. NOT CONTRACT WITH THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THE CAN WE JUST DIG IN A LITTLE BIT DEEPER ON THIS MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP ISSUE. COM IT'S NOT JUST- MISTER O'DONNELL I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE I THINK IT WAS A GREAT IDEA LAUNCHED BY OUR FORMER SPEAKER JOHN PEREZ NOW ARE CHAIR THE UC REGENTS. AND I THINK IT DOES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU YOU KNOW PEOPLE MAKE OVER A HUNDRED. RAND ARE ARE SET BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE YOU CAN BE A TEACHER AND A NURSE OR FIREFIGHTER- YOU KNOW PUBLIC SERVICE WORKER. AND LIVE IN A HIGH COST AREA AND YOU CERTAINLY ARE NOT ARE NOT RICH AND SO- AND I THINK THAT IT WAS A FAIR PROPOSAL THAT DOESN'T COVER. THE FULL TUITION UNDER THE CAL GRANT BUT IT COVERS- A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THE TUITION FOR UC AND CSU. SO CAN YOU WALK THROUGH A BIT MORE AS FAR AS WHAT YOU'RE I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU KNOW A PLAN HERE TODAY BUT WHAT YOUR BIG PICTURE- IDEAS ARE ON MODERNIZING- THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP n OVERALL. I REFORM. THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE SOME MORE DETAILS ON WHAT WE'RE ENVISIONING- FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. UNDER THIS PROGRAM WE FRAMEWORK- SO THIS PROGRAM WOULD AGAIN PICK UP WHERE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA OR WOULD AND- THAT- CLIMATE. THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT YES THE POINT OF FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX. THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED TODAY THERE ARE VARIOUS INCOME POINTS THAT CORRESPOND TO A PERCENTAGE OF TUITION AND FEES COVERAGE. THAT IS OFFERED TO THAT STUDENT AT THE UC OR THE CSU. WE WOULD PROPOSE ESSENTIALLY SUBSTITUTING EST FOR INCOME SO THAT WERE USING THE SAME ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AT THAT WE'RE USING- FOR CAL GRANT PROGRAMS UNDER THE MODERNIZATION PROPOSAL- BUT WE WOULDN'T CHANGE THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE- THE FINANCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM. IT WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF TUITION FEE COVERAGE JUST STUDENTS WITH. GREATER FINANCIAL NEED AND LESS FAMILY SUPPORT SO STUDENTS WITH A LOWER ESP. AND ADDS WE MOVED UP THE EST A SPECTRUM YOU WOULD SEE THAT PERCENTAGE TAPER DOWN UNTIL THE MINIMUM TEN PERCENT. OF TUITION AND FEES THAT THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY COVERS. SO NUMBER YOU. THERE WOULD BE FEWER. MULTIPLE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP BUT IF YOU'RE THE UPPER END OF THE END. YOU WOULD GET LESS AS A REBATE FOR YEAR UC TUITION ESSENTIALLY. WHICH YES YESFOR SURE THAT'S EXACTLY HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS TODAY AND AS HE SPOKE TO THE ONLY CONSIDERATION FOR POLICY MAKERS WOULD THEN BE WHERE DO YOU WANT TO DEFINE THAT- YET SEE A CEILING IN THIS CASE- AND IF THAT INCOME CEILING HAS INCREASED OVER TIME TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AS YOU NOTED IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS- AND THOSE ARE THE STUDENTS WHO WERE SEEN AT TEN PERCENTAGE- A TUITION FEE COVERAGE. OKAY. I'LL COME BACK A BIT MR GALLAGHER. SO ONE OF MY CONCERNS WITH BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL IS. I THINK WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET OUT THE RIGHT THE SAME THING WHICH IS HOW DO WE BEST SUPPORT STUDENTS. I WANTED TO OBTAIN EDUCATIONAL GOALS- AND WE WANT TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING THAT TODAY LIKE MAKE IT- MORE UNDERSTANDABLE AND EASIER. FOR STUDENTS- BUT I WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW WE'RE ALMOST CREATE ANOTHER ALMOST SAFETY NET PROGRAM AND AS- THE- WHERE WE'RE GONNA COVER THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY RELATED TO LIVING EXPENSES YOU KNOW. EDUCATIONAL LIVING EXPERIENCE EXPENSES SO WE'RE WE'RE BASING EVERYTHING ON A- TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE- MOST OF WHICH THE REPORT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES ARE NON EDUCATIONAL LIVING EXPENSES. WHICH I THINK COULD HAVE THE INCENTIVE OF PEOPLE THE SAME WAY I WANT TO GET SUPPORT. MAYBE THEY'RE NOT EVEN DOING IT FOR SCHOOL BUT HEY I'LL SIGN UP FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND AL GET ME- COVERAGE ACCORDINGLY- I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO I DON'T WANT TO CREATE THAT KIND OF INCENTIVE THE INCENTIVE IS HEY I WANT TO GET SUPPORT FOR GOING TO SCHOOL AND MEETING EDUCATIONAL GOALS IT NEEDS ANOTHER WORDS. THEY SHOULD BE MORE OUTCOME BASED. IN OUR LOOKING AT THIS AS OPPOSED TO JUST BASING IT ON INPUTS. OF BETTER ADMITTEDLY VERY EXPENSIVE- SO I GUESS THAT'S MY KIND OF CONCERN WITH OUR WHERE WE'RE KIND OF GOING WITH THIS RIGHT NOW- AGAIN THE PROPOSAL IS NOT WITHOUT MERIT. STREAMLINED ACCESS FOR QUALIFIED STUDENTS- BUT I THINK WE BEST SERVE THE STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS IF WE FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON OUTCOMES- AND NOT JUST EXPENSIVE INPUTS SO COUPLE QUESTIONS I HAVE. NO ONE IS. HOW WE'RE ALLOCATING THIS WE'RE WE'RE PRIMARILY TARGETING THE MAJORITY THE CAL GRANT RESOURCES TOWARDS COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WELL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE MOST AFFORDABLE IN THE COUNTRY I MEAN WE JUST MADE TUITION FREE- FIRST YEAR. HE ALSO FOR GONNA FOCUS ALL THE REFORM OF A LOT OF. MONEY THERE I DON'T KNOW THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE BUT YOU KNOW PLEASE COMMENT WHY ARE WHY ARE WE FOCUSING MOST OF. THE CAL GRANT RESOURCES ON CCC STUDENTS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IS THE ONLY NUMBER AND I THINK. WE SHARE YOUR CONCERN AND YOUR FOCUS ON STUDENT OUTCOMES AND I THINK OUR OUR WORK IS I'M IN LARGE PART MOTIVATED BY- WHAT WE HEAR FROM STUDENTS ABOUT THE BARRIERS THAT CAN BE CREATED BY THOSE EXPENSES. I'M AS WE'RE OFFERING THEM ASSISTANCE FOR TUITION AND FEES SO MANY OF THEM ARE TELLING US THAT THEIR CALLS FOR BUT IT LOOKS HOUSING TRANSPORTATION. ARE THEN- REALLY MAKING IT CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR STUDIES THEIR WORKING HOURS THAT DOWN AND SAYS HE EIGHT- WITH ACADEMIC SUCCESS BEYOND- YOU KNOW FIFTEEN OR TWENTY HOURS THE MOST RESEARCH WOULD SUCCESS IS HELPFUL. I'M JUST USE POST GRADUATION- YOU KNOW THAT BEING SAID IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS- THE VAST MAJORITY OF DOLLARS WOULD ACTUALLY CAN WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TUITION FEE COVERAGE AT THE UC AND CSU. WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS LISTED ON A SLIDE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT- THE FUNDING CHANGE- THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPTIONS WE'VE LAID OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM BUT IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER ONE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE GOING OUT AS- A COUPLE GRAND FOR AWARD TO STUDENTS AT THESE INSTITUTIONS WHEREAS IN A ONE YEAR APPLICATIONS NEW RECIPIENTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- UNDER CURRENT PLANS WOULD RECEIVE SOMETHING CLOSER TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO WE SPENT THE TIME I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS COST OPTIONS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS I'M OUT OF RECOGNITION THAT THOSE ARE THE STUDENTS THAT ARE STATE OR THE LEAST LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORT. FOR THE NON TUITION COSTS THAT- I'VE CREATED SO MANY BARRIERS FOR THEIR PERSISTENCE AND THEIR COMPLETION AND IT ALSO MEANT WE MEANS- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT MAKING THE BEST. A WE'RE NOT DRIVING THE BEST RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT IN OUR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND ARE I'M TUITION FEE COVERAGE IF WE CAN. HELP THE STUDENTS ULTIMATELY COMPLETE. RIGHT ARE WE GET A FOR THE OTHERS TO SAID THIS POINT IN TIME BECAUSE SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WE I HEAR IS THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN REALLY GET IT DONE. TO HELP. YES STUDENTS AT OTHER. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. SO NOW WE'RE GONNA GO ON FOCUS AND PUT A BUNCH OF RESOURCES AND- HERE. AND WE'RE NOT REALLY. SO MADE I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS DO WE WHEN WE LOOK AT STUDENT LOAN BALANCES RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW EXISTING STUDENT LOAN BALANCES DOES THAT GIVE YOU ANY INSIGHT INTO WHERE. YOU KNOW THE FINANCIAL NEED OF STUDENTS ARE WHETHER IT'S IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE CSU OR UC. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE YOU SEEM TO SEE IF YOU IT'S VERY OFTEN IN FACT OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS WERE ALREADY RECEIVING SOME FORM OF NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID WE STILL ENCOURAGE THE LARGEST LEVELS OF STUDENT DEBT. UPON GRADUATION THE PICTURES A LITTLE BIT LESS CLEAR AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES MANY OF WHICH WERE NOT OFFERING STUDENT LOANS TO OUR STUDENTS THAT THEY WERE SURVEYING- BEFORE THE- ENACTMENT OF AB NINETEEN IN THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. I'M SO THERE'S LESS- STUDENT LOAN DEBT INCURRED A ON AVERAGE BY A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT- BUT THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF- DEBT AND COST THAT THE STUDENTS ARE FACING INCLUDING OF COURSE CREDIT CARDS- AND OTHER FORMS OF AND THINGS THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME I'M HOPEFUL INTEREST RATES TO STUDENTS OF THE LOANS DO- WE ACTUALLY AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE RECEIVED FUNDS. TO CONVENE IN A STUDENT LOAN AND DEBT SERVICE REVIEW WORKER WHERE THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING EXPLORED THAT IS ACTUALLY BEING- CHAIRED BY MY COLLEAGUE PATRICK HE'S ON THE LINE TO HELP ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS ON THE DATA SO- I'LL PAUSE HERE AND BE PATRICK MIGHT HAVE SOME. ADDITIONAL INSIGHT. IN YOUR QUESTION ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT- THANKS JAKE- I ACTUALLY. HAVE A NEED FOR. READILY ON STUDENT LOAN BALANCES BY SEGMENT. ON THE GENERAL NATIONAL TRENDS ARE- FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS YOUR HAVE A LARGER NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH LOANS BUT THEIR LOAN AMOUNTS WILL BE SMALLER. AT FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS YOU'LL HAVE FEWER STUDENTS BUT THEIR AVERAGE LOAN AMOUNTS WILL BE LARGER ACROSS TE ACTUAL LARGEST LOAN AMOUNTS OF TEND TO BE ON THE BOOKS FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE GRAD STUDENTS WHO CUMULATE A LOT OF GRADUATE STUDENT DEBT SO. THERE'S A DIFFERENT BALANCE BETWEEN A LOT ALONG WITH A SMALL AMOUNT AND A FEW WITH A VERY LARGE AMOUNT. RIGHT RIGHT BUT BOTTOM LINE WHAT WE ARE SEEN AS A THERE'S A LOT OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AT. WHAT ARE THE SE NON SI NON- COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTITUTIONS WITH REALLY HIGH LOW ABOUT LOAN BALANCES RIGHT NOW THAT WHICH GOES TO MY POINT. I REALLY GET IT DONE FOR THOSE STUDENTS RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE START ALLOCATING RESOURCES MORE. AND I'M NOT PICKING ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE COMMITTEE COLLEGES IS A GREAT SYSTEM OF BUT AGAIN I THINK THE POINT IS IT IS THE MOST AFFORDABLE- SYSTEM RIGHT NOW- WITHOUT GETTING A CALL LIVING WHICH I KNOW CALIFORNIA'S I'M SORRY IT'S A HIGH COST STATE TO LIVE IN AND THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER DISCUSSION THAT WE CAN GET INTO AND EVERYBODY FACES THOSE LIVING COSTS- BUT IN TERMS OF THE COST OF THE EDUCATION ITSELF IS THE MOST. MOST AFFORDABLE IS MY POINT- I EXAM. AND GO AHEAD. RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAHER. YES THIS IS REALLY A COMPLEX ISSUE AND HOW WE SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WITH A VARIETY OF NEEDS THEY HAVE TO PERSIST AND GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE ONE OF THE KEY PROVISIONS OF THIS. FRAMEWORK IS TO BETTER LEVERAGE ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESOURCES TO SERVE STUDENTS WHO DO HAVE THOSE BASIC ME CHALLENGES WHETHER THEY'RE AT THE FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS OR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THIS PROPOSAL DOESN'T ONLY FOCUS ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT LOOKS AT THE WHOLE PICTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS WE'RE LOOKING AT INSTITUTIONAL A FEDERAL AGENTS STATED WORKING IN CONCET. TO SUPPORT ALL THE TUITION COSTS AND FOR THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST TO PROVIDE BASIC NEEDS SUPPORT. ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SITE THAT'S PROBABLY THE AREA THAT THERE'S BEEN THE GREATEST CENTER INVESTMENT COMPARED TO THE FOR YOUR SITE WHICH IS WHY IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE FOCUSING ATTENTION ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE'RE FOCUSING ATTENTION ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE THEY PRIMARILY ARE THE ONES WHO ACCESS IT THROUGH THAT COMPETITIVE. GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS THE LOTTERY PROGRAM SO MANY OF THEM GET LEFT OUT BUT WE'RE NOT IGNORING THE NEEDS OF FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS AS A MATTER OF FACT A CRITICAL COMPONENT. OF THIS PROPOSAL IS HOW WE'RE WORKING WITH INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID TO BACK FEEL TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS. ESPECIALLY ON THE LOWER INCOME SIDE GET SOME SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO JUST THEIR TUITION BECAUSE TUITION. COSTS ASIDE THE LIVING EXPENSES WHETHER YOU GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION BASED ON WHERE YOU LIVE DETERMINES LIVING EXPENSES. SO EVEN THOUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS GET THEIR FEES WAIVED IN LARGE PART- OF THE LIVING EXPENSES REMAIN THE SAME AS THE WORK PERSON WHO GOES TO YOU SEE. SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT LIVING EXPENSES- NON TUITION COSTS IS A KEY COMPONENT OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT IS THAT STUDENTS NEED. TO ACTUALLY SUCCEED. IN GRADUATE AND HOPEFULLY IN FOR YOU HERE'S BECAUSE APPS WE NEED THEM TO GET THE WORK. AND THE- AN EXAM- CAL GRANT AFTER YEARS. SO WE ARE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO TRY TO ACCELERATE GRADUATION AND COMPLETION SO STUDENTS CAN MOVE ON INTO THE WORKPLACE. OKAY AND THEN JUST FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID THERE WERE KIND OF LEVERAGING FEDERAL AND OTHER YOU KNOW INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT. DO WE EXPECT THAT STUDENT MORE STUDENTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PELL GRANTS. AND CAL GRANTS BASED ON THE RECENT CHANGES TO FASTER. WELL THE RECENT CHANGES ARE PROPOSED FOR FASTER AND THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE UNTIL TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR BUT WE DO THINK BY MAKING IT EASIER TO APPLY MORE STUDENTS WILL LIKELY APPLY THE MORE IMMEDIATE CHANGES THAT WILL SEE- IN THE NEXT- THE NEXT- ACADEMIC FINANCIALLY CYCLE ARE THE CHANGES TO THE PELL GRANT ELIGIBILITY RIGHT AND THAT'S WHERE MY STAFF ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY RIGHT NOW TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT IMPACT IS. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT MORE STUDENTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL AID AND THERE IS THE POTENTIAL TO EVEN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PELL GRANT AID WHICH CURRENTLY IS ABOUT. SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR FOR A VERY LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT TO INCREASE THE FOR EVERY STUDENT THAT QUALIFIES FOR PELL GRANT AID THAT'S LESS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO PROVIDE BASIC NEEDS SUPPORT AT THE STATE LEVEL. ARE YOU HOPEFUL THE NEW CHAIN TO THE FEDERAL. ARE GOING TO DRAW MORE RESOURCES TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. OKAY AND THEN DOES THIS PROPOSAL CHANGE THE TOTAL YEARS OF CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY. FOR STUDENTS TO START AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. NO IT DOESN'T WE WE'VE STEP WE STICK WITH THE SAME OUT FOR YOUR ELIGIBILITY LIFESPAN OF THE CALDERON AWARDS CAL GRANT AWARD DOES LAST FOR SIX YEARS BUT THE CAL GROUNDWORK CURRENTLY LAST FOR FOUR YEARS. AND IT'S PRO RATED IF YOU GO PART TIME. THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAD MISSED YEAH. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO NOTE MR GALLAGHER THAT- I DON'T THINK IT. IT IT FOCUSES MORE ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE PER SE IT'S JUST IT'S BY DEFINITION THERE ARE WAY MORE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THERE ARE- THERE ARE YOU KNOW TWO MILLION COMMITTEE CALLS TO INVENTING RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE THAT SAYS IF YOU LOOK I KNOW YOU WANT TO CAL. AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IT COSTS TO GO TO UC BERKELEY VERSUS BERKELEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YOU WOULD THINK OUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CHEAP CHEAPER OPTION BECAUSE- ONE HOUR THREE COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF BACK THEN WE HAD THAT. THE BOG WAIVERS. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL AID THAT CAL GRANT RECEIPT GETS. FROM THE STATE PLUS PELL PLUS INSTITUTIONAL AID- IT'S WAY BETTER OFF TO GO TO UC BERKELEY THAT IS FOR GOING TO COMMIT BECAUSE WAY MORE FINANCIAL AID AND SO. AND THE INCOME OF THAT STUDENT IS TEN TIMES GREATER SOMETIMES IN THE KID IN THE- COMMUNIQU ALSO AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS THAT- NOT. NON TUITION AND NON HOUSING COSTS IT IS REALLY THE HOUSING COSTS. OF YOUR FULL TIME STUDENT COMMUNICABLE DISEASE COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE WANT TO. HELP YOU SUCCEED AND GET YOUR DEGREE AND TRANSFER AND MOVE ON SO. SO THAT THE NOTION OF THIS AND THAT'S WHY IT IS WAY MORE MONEY FOR THAT COHORT BECAUSE- THERE ARE WAY MORE STUDENTS AND THAT'S- THAT'S THAT'S THE POPULATION HAS THE HAS THE GREATEST NEED SO. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AT BOTH AT BOTH- SEGMENTS AND IT'S WE HAVE A- KEEP A COLISEUM CALIFORNIA THAT HAS TWO YEARS AND FOUR YEARS AND THAT'S PART OF IT SO. I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE NOTION OF WHAT- WORK WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS- THE MOST IMPORTANTLY JUST MAKE IT EASIER. WE HAVE THE CAL GRANT AA THE V. IN THE SEA AND THEN ALL THESE OTHER PIECES JUST LIKE ONE WITH THIS ONE SIMPLE APPLICATION TO PASS A- YEAR AGO TWO YEARS AGO TO FOR YEARS AND SO- I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT THAT- THAT WE- MAKING PROGRESS WITH BUT YOU KNOW NOT NOT DONE JUST YET SO. I KNOW EACH OF US HAVE TO GET TO OUR RESPECTIVE CAUCUSES IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES SO- LET'S LET'S I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. WE'LL KEEP WORKING ON THIS THERE ARE BILLS IN THE POLICY PIPELINE AS WELL WE WILL NOW GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANYBODY IS HERE.
