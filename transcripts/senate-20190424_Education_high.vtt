00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:33.886
BUT THEY'D BE DON'T.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.422
MY TRAUMA BEGAN WHEN PARENTS ARE

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.090
SCHOOL OBSERVED A HIGH TEACHER

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.359
TURNOVER WE LOST THE MAJORITY OF

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.428
OUR TEACHERS AND AS PARENTS WE

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.096
ORGANIZE AND BEGAN TO DEMAND

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:46.432
ANSWERS FROM MARCOLE FOUNDERS.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:48.000
I DISCOVERED THE MAJORITY OF OUR

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.169
BOARD MEMBERS HAVE NO EDUCATION

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:51.470
BACKGROUND AND THEY DON'T LIVE

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:52.738
IN OUR SURROUNDING COULDN'T

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:53.773
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.041
BUT THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.676
ABOUT OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.277
IN FUTURE THIS HAS BEEN

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:01.747
CONCERNING FOR ME.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:02.515
I'M NOT RELATE TO THE NEEDS OF

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:05.751
OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY.

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.453
I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.388
I MADE THE MISTAKE OF ASKING

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:11.224
QUESTIONS ABOUT SCHOOL BUDGETS

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.359
AND HOW FUNDS WERE BEING SPENT

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:15.094
TO HELP OUR KIDS.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.796
IN MY TWENTY FOUR YEARS WITH

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:18.197
THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS I HAVE

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.299
SEEN AND EXPERIENCED THINGS THAT

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.501
MAKE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.303
HAVE A FUTURE A HUGE PROBLEM AND

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.138
A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:27.240
CHARTER SCHOOLS.

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:28.908
TIME AND TIME AGAIN I HAVE SEEN

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:30.877
THE RULES AND THE REGULATIONS

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:31.677
THAT CURRENTLY GOVERN CHARTER

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:34.313
SCHOOLS IGNORED AND DISREGARDED.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.848
AT THE AT CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:38.751
LITTLE TO NO CONSEQUENCES AND IT

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.286
HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR MOST

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.587
VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:42.722
COMMUNITIES.

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:45.057
MY YOUNGEST SON WITH

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:46.626
DISABILITIES AND NINE WERE

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:47.827
UNABLE TO GET THE CHARTER SCHOOL

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.195
TO PROVIDE HIM SUPPORT THE

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.930
CHARTER SCHOOL MY CHILDREN

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.698
ATTENDED COUNSELED MANY STUDENTS

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.368
OUT WITH DISABILITIES TELLING

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:55.568
THEM.

00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:56.669
THAT THING.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.170
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.305
AND SUPPORTS TO MEET THE

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.274
STUDENTS NEEDS SO IT'S BEST TO

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.009
ROOMMATE FOR THEM TO REMAIN IN

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:04.377
THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT THE

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.279
CHARTER SCHOOL ALSO FALSIFIES

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.380
GREAT SO IT SEEMS THE STUDENTS

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:08.581
ARE DOING WELL.

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:10.483
WHEN IN FACT THEY'RE NOT I HAVE

00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:11.851
PERSONALLY BEEN THREATENED BY

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.619
THE SPECIAL EDUCATION DIRECTOR

AND BY MY SCHOOLS CO FOUNDERS

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.222
FOR SPEAKING OUT?

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.690
ABOUT PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE SEEN

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.126
FIRST HAND OUR SCHOOLS DO NOT

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:21.427
GET ENOUGH FUNDING FOR SPECIAL

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.229
EDUCATION BUT IT'S IF STUDENTS

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.264
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS LIKE MINOR

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.933
PUSHED OUT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.668
DISTRICT AT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.002
DISTRICT SCHOOLS ASSUME HIGHER

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.604
FINANCIAL BURDEN.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.272
IT IS NOT FAIR.

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:34.774
THE CURRENT SYSTEM HARMS THAT

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.876
ONLY FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:39.011
BUT ENTIRE THIS ABOVE THE ENTIRE

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:41.580
SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION WHEN

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:42.915

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.996
IN MY COMMUNITY.

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:31.130
THE CHARTER SCHOOL LAW IS BROKE

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.732

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:46.652
FIVE YEARS IS THE DIFFERENCE

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:48.020

TO PRISON PIPELINE.

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.839

FOR TODAY.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:31.163
WHEN THE CHARTER TASK FORCE IS

HERE BUT THE FUTURE COMMITTEE

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:01.729
THAT WOULD REFLECT THAT.

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:03.264
TYPE OF APPROACH IS IS SAYING A

KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING YOU

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:18.513
BELIEVE AND EMPOWER THE THE

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.016
PEOPLE IN SCHOOL DISTRICT TO BE

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.051
ABLE TO HAVE.

BASICALLY MAKE THE DECISIONS

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.620
THAT NEED NEED TO MAKE -- ABOUT

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:28.957
ABOUT -- THESE DECISIONS SO I

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:31.226
WENT TO SUPPOSE THAT THE DOCTOR

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:33.561
PAN AS THE CHAIR -- I HAVEN'T

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:34.929

THE NEXT COMMITTEE.

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.071
CORRECT BECAUSE THEY THEY SAID I

TELL I DON'T HAVE ANY AMENDMENTS

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:46.207
SPECIFIC AMEND ITS EITHER OKAY I

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:47.709
THINK IT THIS IS BASED ON THE

DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH -- BUT

01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:51.479
WITH -- FOLKS -- BUT I THINK

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:52.847
IT'S A SORT OF A DIFFERENT

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:55.450
APPROACH AND SO I I WANTED TO

POSE THAT -- BECAUSE I THINK I

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:58.887

AND MOVE FORWARD IN A MUCH MORE

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:43.377
DELIBERATIVE INTEGRATED WAY AND

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.780

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:42.703
THERE'S A PARTICULAR SET OF

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:44.505
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:46.340
THAT HAVE APPLIED ONLY TO THE

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:48.776

BUT FIVE YEARS IS NOT  PAUSE.

01:31:18.573 --> 01:31:21.175
FIVE YEARS JUST NOT A PAUSE --

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.176
WE'VE DONE THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.644

CHANCE TO LISTEN TO THE

TESTIMONY EARLIER -- WILL BRING

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:41.829
RUN AROUND A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:44.665
DIRECTIONS -- AND I I WANT TO

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:46.334
APPLAUD THE AUTHOR -- FOR

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.335
RELEASED THE INITIATING THIS

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:48.936
CONVERSATION A VERY IMPORTANT

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:50.838
CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR PUBLIC

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:52.940
SCHOOLS AND THERE IS A LOT OF

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:54.876
DIFFICULTY ACROSS THE STATE IN

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:56.711
THE SPACE -- A BIG -- DEBATED

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:59.313
SAY THE OBVIOUS -- BIG PUBLIC

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.882
SCHOOL ADVOCATES.

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:02.817
AND I KNOW THAT'S THAT THE GOALS

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:05.419
AND DESIRES THAT YOU HAVE AND I

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:07.255
AND I SHARE THEM -- AND BUT THIS

01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:08.689
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT'S WRONG

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:09.957
WITH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS MUCH

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:11.125
BROADER THAN THIS ISSUE OF

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.760
CHARTERS.

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:13.794
AND I THINK IT'S SENATOR PAN

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:15.363
MANSION IN HIS REMARKS ND

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:17.632
OTHERS -- THAT ACROSS THE

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:20.201
SPECTRUM WE HAVE THE STRONG ONES.

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:22.536
CHARTER'S STRONG PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:24.138
AND WE ALSO HAVE ONES THAT ARE

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:25.473
JUST NOT DOING SO WELL.

01:32:25.539 --> 01:32:27.141
AND THAT REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:30.177
AND BUT IT'S AND IT'S MORE THAN

01:32:30.244 --> 01:32:32.246
JUST ABOUT CHARTERS -- IT'S

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.881
ABOUT FINANCES.

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:37.718
IT'S ABOUT QUALITY -- IT'S ABOUT --

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:39.120
AT TEACHER TRAINING.

01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:41.555
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT --

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:43.958
AND THAT'S WHY I APPLIED TO YOUR

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:45.026
EFFORT TO GET INTO THE SPACE AND

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:46.761
INITIATE THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:48.529
BECAUSE THIS IS SO IMPORTANT.

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:50.331
YES LOOK AT HOW LOUD PORT IS TO

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.199
WHAT WE DO IS A STATE HOW MUCH

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:54.502
MONEY WE DIRECT TO IT IT'S IT'S

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:56.737
HUGE AND THE MORE CONVERSATIONS

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:48.969
DATA THIS IS HARD COLD FACTUAL

01:46:49.035 --> 01:46:49.770
DATA.

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:51.238
THE STATUS QUO IS ACTUALLY

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:53.406
WIDENING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS

01:46:53.473 --> 01:46:54.741
AND HEALTH DISPARITIES AT OUR

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:56.576
STATE BECAUSE EARLY STARTS ARE

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:58.545
PROVEN TO HER DISADVANTAGED

01:46:58.612 --> 01:47:00.280
CHILDREN THE MOST.

01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:02.249
FRANKLY THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS ON

01:47:02.315 --> 01:47:04.918
JOSH ON SO MANY LEVELS MANY

01:47:04.985 --> 01:47:06.753
STUDENTS SHOW THAT DISADVANTAGED

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.555
CHILDREN AREADY GET LESS SLEEP

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:10.791
THAN THEIR MORE PRIVILEGE PEERS.

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:12.259
THEY FACE MORE OBSTACLES GETTING

01:47:12.325 --> 01:47:13.493
UP EARLY BELLS ON TIME.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.995
AND THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:17.197
AFFECTED BY THE HARM OF

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:18.431
DEVELOPMENTALLY INAPPROPRIATE

01:47:18.498 --> 01:47:19.866
START TIMES.

01:47:19.933 --> 01:47:24.204
THE GOOD NEWS IS ACCORDING TO-THE CDC LATER START TIMES ARE

01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:26.807
THE SINGLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

01:47:26.873 --> 01:47:30.710
PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION LET

01:47:30.777 --> 01:47:31.845
ME SAY THAT AGAIN.

01:47:31.912 --> 01:47:32.512
LATER START TIMES ARE THE SINGLE

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:33.613
MOST COST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.215
HEALTH INTERVENTION WITH THE

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:36.950
POTENTIAL TO HELP THE LARGEST

01:47:37.017 --> 01:47:38.752
NUMBER OF CHILDREN TO COMBAT THE

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:41.354
ADOLESCENT SLEEP LOSS EPIDEMIC.

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:43.857
THERE IS AN EXPANSIVE EVIDENCE

01:47:43.924 --> 01:47:46.193
SPANNING DECADES THAT ONE SCHOOL

01:47:46.259 --> 01:47:49.095
START LATER TEENS GET MORE SLEEP.

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:50.564
THEY ARE HEALTHIER THEY'RE

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:53.033
HAPPIER THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO

01:47:53.099 --> 01:47:55.202
CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE LESS LIKELY

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:56.803
TO GET IN CAR ACCIDENTS THEIR

01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:58.505
ATTENDANCE GOES UP THEIR GRADES

01:47:58.572 --> 01:48:01.007
GO UP AND GRADUATIONS GROW UP.

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:02.442
AND IN CALIFORNIA INCREASE

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:04.444
ATTENDANCE MEANS INCREASED

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:06.613
AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE FUNDS

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.316
TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS A 1%

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:11.251
INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE IN THE LA

01:48:11.318 --> 01:48:13.520
U. S. THE WOULD INCREASE. TWENTY

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:15.422
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THEN AS IF

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:16.823
IT WERE NOT ENOUGH THE RAND

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.325
CORPORATION PROJECTS THAT

01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:20.260
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WILL GROW

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:22.529
BY ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:24.431
OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS A

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:27.100
RESULT OF THE HIGHER GRADUATION

01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:28.635
RATES FEWER CAR ACCIDENTS FEWER

01:48:28.702 --> 01:48:31.071
DISCIPLINE BETTER PRODUCTIVITY

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:32.038
WITH LATE START.

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:35.842
AND EVERY YEAR THE EVIDENCE JUST

01:48:35.909 --> 01:48:37.143
KEEPS AMOUNTING.

01:48:37.210 --> 01:48:38.011
AFTER A RECENT STUDY OF THE

01:48:38.078 --> 01:48:39.746
SEATTLE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT A

01:48:39.813 --> 01:48:41.448
LARGER URBAN DISTRICT WHICH

01:48:41.514 --> 01:48:42.515
ADOPTED LATE START.

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:44.918
CONFIRMS THE PREVIOUS FINDINGS

01:48:44.985 --> 01:48:46.720
WITH THE SHIFT TO LATER STARTS

01:48:46.786 --> 01:48:47.354
THEIR STUDENTS ARE GETTING MORE

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.856
SLEEP GETTING BETTER GRADES AND

01:48:49.923 --> 01:48:51.591
ATTENDING SCHOOL MORE OFTEN

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:53.627
ATTENDANCE IMPROVED THE MOST

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:56.096
THAT SCHOOLS WITH THE MOST LOW

01:48:56.162 --> 01:48:57.197
INCOME STUDENTS LET ME SAY THAT

01:48:57.264 --> 01:48:57.731
AGAIN.

01:48:57.797 --> 01:48:59.666
ATTENDANCE IMPROVED AT THE

01:48:59.733 --> 01:49:01.968
SCHOOLS WITH THE MOST LOW INCOME

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:03.036
STUDENTS.

01:49:03.103 --> 01:49:05.005
STUDENT ATHLETES ARE ALSO A BIG

01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:06.740
BENEFICIARY I'M SURE SOMEBODY

01:49:06.806 --> 01:49:08.308
WHO WILL OPPOSE THIS BILL WILL

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:10.744
MENTION THE IMPACT ON SPORTS AS

01:49:10.810 --> 01:49:11.878
A NEGATIVE.

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:13.413
HEALTHY SCHOOL START TIME HAS

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.116
WELL HELPS OUR ATHLETES.

01:49:16.182 --> 01:49:18.418
THEY GET HURT LESS AND THEY

01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:21.521
PARTICIPATE MORE -- IT'S JUST

01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:24.024
STAGGERING THE IMPACT AND AGAIN

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.125
AS A PARENT.

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:26.626
OF A STUDENT ATHLETE AND A

01:49:26.693 --> 01:49:27.928
PARENT WHO SEES OTHER KIDS

WANTED TO PERFORM PERFORMANCE

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:32.699
INCREASES AND INJURIES DECREASE.

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:33.833
WE KNOW THAT HEALTHY SCHOOL

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.735
HOURS WORK THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:37.637
WELL RUN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS

01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:39.272
THE NATION THAT THRIVE WITH

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:41.174
LATER AGE APPROPRIATE START

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:42.142
TIMES AT THEIR MIDDLE AND HIGH

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:42.575
SCHOOLS.

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:44.110
THEY HAVE HEALTHIER AND SAFER

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:46.212
STUDENTS AND SUCCESSFUL SPORTS

01:49:46.279 --> 01:49:48.348
PROGRAMS THE DATA AND EVIDENCE

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:49.616
IS VERY CLEAR.

01:49:49.683 --> 01:49:51.351
EARLY MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL

SAFETY STANDARDS FOR OUR PUBLIC

01:50:04.864 --> 01:50:06.800
EDUCATION SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE

01:50:06.866 --> 01:50:07.867
WHEN SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

01:50:07.934 --> 01:50:10.470
REVEALED THE DANGERS OF ASBESTOS

EARLY SECONDARY SCHOOL START

01:50:31.591 --> 01:50:37.797
TIMES I'VE OFTEN BEEN ASKED WHY

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:38.331
I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT.

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:02.982
STANFORD UNIVERSITY.

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:04.017
THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR AN

01:52:04.084 --> 01:52:05.652
INDISPUTABLE THAT ADOLESCENTS

01:52:05.718 --> 01:52:06.319
ARE SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC SLEEP

01:52:06.386 --> 01:52:07.954
DEPRIVATION WHICH IS CAUSING

01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:09.823
THEM HARM.

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:12.092
SCIENCE TEACHES US LESSONS ARE

01:52:12.158 --> 01:52:13.026
PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO SLEEP

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:14.227
DEPRIVATION BECAUSE THERE IS A

01:52:14.294 --> 01:52:15.462
BIOLOGICAL SHIFT IN THEIR BRAIN

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:16.696
RHYTHMS THAT HEIGHTENS THEIR

01:52:16.763 --> 01:52:18.765
LIVES AT NIGHT WHICH FORCES THEM

01:52:18.832 --> 01:52:20.300
TO FALL ASLEEP LATER.

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:21.234
THERE ARE DECADES OF PEER REVIEW

01:52:21.301 --> 01:52:22.502
DATA SHOWING THAT.

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:23.670
THIS IS A WORSENING PUBLIC

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:25.338
HEALTH PROBLEM.

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:27.073
THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL.

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:27.740
HAVE YOU PUT A THAT INSUFFICIENT

01:52:27.807 --> 01:52:29.075
SLEEP AMONG STUDENTS HAS NOW

01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:32.112
INCREASED TO WELL OVER 70%.

01:52:32.178 --> 01:52:33.546
A RECENT REVIEW ENCOMPASSING

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:36.983
NEARLY 600-100-0600 THOUSAND

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:37.517
TEENAGERS FROM THE SLEEP

01:52:37.584 --> 01:52:39.252
DURATION IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:40.820
FACTOR INDEPENDENT OF MOOD

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:42.255
INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR

01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:44.057
DEVELOPMENT OF SUICIDALITY.

01:52:44.124 --> 01:52:45.658
THE LUIS SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR IS

01:52:45.725 --> 01:52:46.526
FIRST SAW STIPULATIONS OF EIGHT

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.694
TO NINE HOURS.

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:49.929
MOST TEENAGERS ARE LUCKY TO GET

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:50.497
EVEN SEVEN HOURS ON SCHOOL

01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:52.799
NIGHTS. ONE FORTY FOR TEENAGERS

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:54.434
SCHOOL START TO EARLY.

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:55.602
THIS HAS LED TO VERY SERIOUS

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:56.302
PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH

01:52:56.369 --> 01:52:57.871
PROBLEMS INCLUDING DECREASE

01:52:57.937 --> 01:53:00.273
SCHOOL PERFORMANCE MEANT AND-MENTAL HEALTH ALONG WITH

01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:01.608
INCREASED CAR ACCIDENTS.

01:53:01.674 --> 01:53:03.076
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE

01:53:03.143 --> 01:53:04.110
RESEARCH HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN

01:53:04.177 --> 01:53:05.178
THE DELAYING THE SCHOOL START

01:53:05.245 --> 01:53:07.080
TIME AS IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:08.314
WELL BEING OF TEENAGERS.

01:53:08.381 --> 01:53:08.882
THE BIOLOGY OF THEIR STEEP

01:53:08.948 --> 01:53:10.183
CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE TREATED AS

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.751

02:06:58.277 --> 02:06:59.645
OKAY SEEING AND HEARING THEN I'M

02:06:59.712 --> 02:07:00.245
GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE

02:07:00.312 --> 02:07:02.147

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:03.716
COMMITTEE FOR THEIR INPUT.

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:07.086
I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY INPUT.

02:07:07.152 --> 02:07:08.253
FIRST I WAS A YOUR RIGHT CENTER

02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.189
PORTANTINO I'VE SPENT A LOT OF

02:07:10.255 --> 02:07:11.790
TIME ON THIS BILL.

02:07:11.857 --> 02:07:13.092
AND IT'S BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A

02:07:13.158 --> 02:07:16.095
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE I READ THE

02:07:16.161 --> 02:07:17.496
ENTIRE BOOK THAT YOU PRO

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:19.064
PROVIDED US WITH I MADE MY OWN

02:07:19.131 --> 02:07:19.732
NOTES.

02:07:19.798 --> 02:07:21.667
AND WHILE THE MAJORITY OF IT

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:24.303
DOES SUGGEST THAT SLEEP TIME IS

02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:25.971
SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT I

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:27.439
THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT.

02:07:27.506 --> 02:07:28.941
EVEN IN THIS REPORT THAT YOU

02:07:29.008 --> 02:07:30.676
GAVE US IT TALKS ABOUT ACADEMIC

02:07:30.743 --> 02:07:33.178
IMPROVEMENT IS ACTUALLY NOT

02:07:33.245 --> 02:07:35.114
STATISTICALLYSIGNIFICANT ENOUGH

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:37.249
TO LIST.

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:38.751
IT TALKS ABOUT -- THERE'S MORE

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:41.420
THAN JUST CHANGING START TIMES.

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:43.522
THAT PARENTS NEED TO HELP THEIR

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:45.691
KIDS GET MORE SLEEP THE PARENTS

02:07:45.758 --> 02:07:47.292
NEED TO TAKE THEIR KIDS OFF OF

02:07:47.359 --> 02:07:48.727
THEIR PHONES THAT KIDS PARENTS

02:07:48.794 --> 02:07:49.728
NEED.

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:53.232
TO TAKE AWAY THE TELEVISION TIME

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.967
SO.

02:07:55.034 --> 02:07:55.534
I APPRECIATE IT I READ IT.

02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:59.204
MY CONCERNS FOR THE BILL OUR ONE

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:00.639
AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY.

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:02.374
THAT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:03.876
ALREADY HAS THE RIGHT TO DO THIS

02:08:03.942 --> 02:08:05.177
EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:06.345
ALREADY DO THIS.

02:08:06.412 --> 02:08:07.846
AND I THINK THE EACH SCHOOL

02:08:07.913 --> 02:08:09.882
DISTRICT IS UNIQUE AND IN DOING

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:11.717
RESEARCH ON THIS BILL WE FOUND

02:08:11.784 --> 02:08:13.886
THAT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:08:13.952 --> 02:08:15.554
STARTED A LATER START TIME.

02:08:15.621 --> 02:08:17.089
AND IT WORKED AND THEY LOVE IT

02:08:17.156 --> 02:08:19.224
IN THE CONTINUE AT OTHER STARTED

02:08:19.291 --> 02:08:21.293
IT IT DIDN'T WORK AND THEY WENT

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.194
BACK.

02:08:22.261 --> 02:08:24.329
SO I THINK IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY

02:08:24.396 --> 02:08:27.433
THAT ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

02:08:27.499 --> 02:08:30.803
I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:32.638
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE HEARD

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:34.073
A LITTLE BIT TOM FROM ROOM OF

02:08:34.139 --> 02:08:35.407
WORLD.

02:08:35.474 --> 02:08:36.975
ABOUT THE SCHOOL BUSES WHEN YOU

02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:38.744
AND I MET I SHARED WITH YOU THAT

02:08:38.811 --> 02:08:40.612
MY OWN COUNTY OF SAMBAR TO DINO

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:42.681
WOULD HAVE TO DUPLICATE THEIR

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:44.349
BUSES TO A COST OF TEN MILLION

02:08:44.416 --> 02:08:45.284
DOLLARS.

02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:46.685
I JUST DON'T THINK THOSE ARE

02:08:46.752 --> 02:08:47.686
INSIGNIFICANT.

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:49.922
I'M ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE WE

02:08:49.988 --> 02:08:51.957
HAVE TEACHERS STRIKING FOR

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:53.659
SMALLER CLASS SIZES FOR

02:08:53.725 --> 02:08:57.362
COUNSELORS FOR NURSES SO.

02:08:57.429 --> 02:08:58.564
THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT

02:08:58.630 --> 02:09:00.632
WE ARE FACING IN OUR OUR SCHOOL

02:09:00.699 --> 02:09:03.102
SYSTEM RIGHT NOW K. THROUGH.

02:09:03.168 --> 02:09:04.169
TWELVE AND I JUST WORRY THAT

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:06.505
THIS IS NOT THE BEST THING TO DO

02:09:06.572 --> 02:09:08.674
AT THIS TIME I APPRECIATE YOUR

02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:10.943
PASSION -- I TO AGREE WE DON'T

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:12.511
WANT TO SEE ANY KIDS COMMIT

02:09:12.578 --> 02:09:13.645
SUICIDE.

02:09:13.712 --> 02:09:15.881
BUT I WORRIED THAT THIS BILL IS

02:09:15.948 --> 02:09:17.049
GOING TO HAVE SO MANY UNINTENDED

02:09:17.116 --> 02:09:18.884
CONSEQUENCES THEY WERE GOING TO

02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:19.418
FIND OURSELVES IN A WORSE

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:20.319
POSITION.

02:09:20.385 --> 02:09:22.154
THAN WE'RE IN NOW SO FOR THOSE

02:09:22.221 --> 02:09:24.356
REASONS I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

02:09:24.423 --> 02:09:25.557
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY.

02:09:25.624 --> 02:09:27.426
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

02:09:27.493 --> 02:09:30.629
FROM COMMITTEE.

02:09:30.696 --> 02:09:33.966
THANK YOU CENTER CHIANG.

02:09:34.032 --> 02:09:36.735
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- SO I

WAS IN NO ON THIS.

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:40.506
ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR.

02:09:40.572 --> 02:09:42.841
AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR OF

02:09:42.908 --> 02:09:45.210
CONTACTING ME IN AND I LOOKED

02:09:45.277 --> 02:09:46.478
INTO IT MYSELF.

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:47.913
I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF OF

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:48.914
PHYSICIANS.

02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:50.649
I'VE TALKED TO A TON OF PARENTS

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:52.017
ACTUALLY IN THE DISTRICT

02:09:52.084 --> 02:09:53.752
CONTACTED ME.

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:56.555
AND ULTIMATELY AFTER REVIEWING

02:09:56.622 --> 02:09:58.557
THE RESEARCH I AM BEGINNING TO

02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:00.392
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC

02:10:00.459 --> 02:10:02.995
HEALTH ISSUE -- I'M WILLING TO

02:10:03.061 --> 02:10:05.731
TRY SOMETHING NEW FOR STUDENTS

02:10:05.797 --> 02:10:07.232
THE SCIENCE DOES SHOW THAT OUR

02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:08.667
STUDENTS CAN BENEFIT.

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:10.235
FROM A LATER START TO THEIR

02:10:10.302 --> 02:10:11.737
SCHOOL DAYS AND I AM SUPPORTER

02:10:11.803 --> 02:10:13.539
OF THAT BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY

02:10:13.605 --> 02:10:15.908
THAT I DID -- I HEAR FROM

02:10:15.974 --> 02:10:17.609
OPPOSITION REGARDING THE LOCAL

02:10:17.676 --> 02:10:18.877
CONTROL ISSUES.

02:10:18.944 --> 02:10:20.479
AND I WOULD LIKE TO VISIT THIS

02:10:20.546 --> 02:10:22.614
AT A LATER DATE IF IT'S NOT

02:10:22.681 --> 02:10:24.750
WORKING BUT AT THIS POINT I AM

02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:27.019
WILLING TO TO GIVE THIS A CHANCE

02:10:27.085 --> 02:10:28.453
AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:30.422
PASSION SO TODAY WILL BE A

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:31.623
SUPPORTING THIS BILL.

02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:32.558
THANK YOU CENTER CHIANG OTHER

02:10:32.624 --> 02:10:35.060
DOCTOR PAN.

02:10:35.127 --> 02:10:39.831
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND A BUT

02:10:39.898 --> 02:10:42.367
SO FIRST WIFE SAID THAT -- NO

02:10:42.434 --> 02:10:43.435
I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL

02:10:43.502 --> 02:10:48.240
BECAUSE THE THE DATA -- ON ON

02:10:48.307 --> 02:10:50.976
THIS ISSUE IS EXTREMELY STRONG --

02:10:51.043 --> 02:10:53.345
AND THIS IS THIS IS A

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:54.713
PEDIATRICIAN AND SOMEONE.

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:56.315
TO SCIENTISTS AND CERTAINLY I

02:10:56.381 --> 02:10:59.184
KNOW THAT MANY OF THIS THERE'S A

02:10:59.251 --> 02:11:00.419
THERE'S A CAN DOWN THERE'S

02:11:00.485 --> 02:11:02.487
BASICALLY CONSENSUS AND AND THE

02:11:02.554 --> 02:11:04.489
EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO LOOK AT

02:11:04.556 --> 02:11:05.958
PEDIATRICS AND DEVELOPMENT.

02:11:06.024 --> 02:11:07.759
AND SLEEP IN WE'VE HEARD FROM

02:11:07.826 --> 02:11:10.462
SOME OF THEM HERE -- I RECOGNIZE

02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:12.164
FROM THE OPPOSITION I APPRECIATE

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:13.098
I HAVE A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER

02:11:13.165 --> 02:11:15.834
FROM MY OWN SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE

02:11:15.901 --> 02:11:16.735
WHO'S OPPOSED.

02:11:16.802 --> 02:11:18.303
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT I HEAR

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:19.871
THE OPPOSITION AS WELL IT'S

02:11:19.938 --> 02:11:21.373
GONNA BE HARD TO DO THIS.

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:22.441
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WILL BUT

02:11:22.507 --> 02:11:23.809
THERE THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES

02:11:23.875 --> 02:11:27.012
IN A BE HARD BUT WE TALK ABOUT

02:11:27.079 --> 02:11:28.113
AND BELIEVE ME I'M SOMEONE WHO

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:29.147
WANTS TO SEE MORE SCHOOL NURSES

02:11:29.214 --> 02:11:31.016
PSYCHOLOGISTS SMALLER CLASS SIZE

02:11:31.083 --> 02:11:32.251
AND SO FORTH AND THOSE ARE GONNA

02:11:32.317 --> 02:11:34.686
BE VERY IMPORTANT -- THAT WHAT

02:11:34.753 --> 02:11:36.188
WHY ARE WE TRYING TO GIVE OUR

02:11:36.255 --> 02:11:39.124
KIDS EVERY CHANCE AT SUCCESS.

02:11:39.191 --> 02:11:40.726
AND THE DATASHOWS THIS IS AN

02:11:40.792 --> 02:11:42.394
IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS.

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:43.528
AND PART OF THE REASON FOR

02:11:43.595 --> 02:11:44.463
SAYING THAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO

02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:45.897
THIS ACROSS THE STATE YES PEOPLE

02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:46.898
ARE CHALLENGED WITH TRYING TO

02:11:46.965 --> 02:11:48.600
GET TO WORK WELL ACTUALLY IF

02:11:48.667 --> 02:11:50.269
EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE

02:11:50.335 --> 02:11:51.503
STATE WAS DOING THIS.

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:52.371
I THINK WE'LL SEE SOME

02:11:52.437 --> 02:11:54.506
ADJUSTMENTS IN WORKPLACES

02:11:54.573 --> 02:11:55.774
BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S

02:11:55.841 --> 02:11:57.542
NOT JUST A COUPLE PARENTS WERE

02:11:57.609 --> 02:11:58.343
TRYING TO DO THIS.

02:11:58.410 --> 02:12:00.312
IT'S OUGHT TO PARENTS NEED TO

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:01.580
WORK WITH THEIR CHILDREN AROUND

02:12:01.647 --> 02:12:03.048
A CHRONIC SINCE SCREENS YES THEY

02:12:03.115 --> 02:12:05.784
DO -- BU THE SAME TIME WHAT

02:12:05.851 --> 02:12:06.652
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE

02:12:06.718 --> 02:12:08.120
WORKING AGAINST BIOLOGY WHEN WE

02:12:08.186 --> 02:12:10.255
SAY WELL IN ADDITION TO THAT WE

02:12:10.322 --> 02:12:11.323
ALSO NEED TO TELL OUR KIDS THEY

02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:13.692
NEED TO GET UP EARLIER THAN

02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:14.960
THEIR SLEEP CYCLE THAT THE

02:12:15.027 --> 02:12:16.895
PROVIDENCE SHOWS WITH THE SLEEP

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:17.729
CYCLE IS.

02:12:17.796 --> 02:12:19.431
SO -- WE HAVE TO THINK IS OUR

02:12:19.498 --> 02:12:20.632
SCHOOLS FOR STUDENTS OUR

STUDENTS FOR SCHOOLS AND OUR

02:12:22.267 --> 02:12:23.802
SCHOOLS ARE FOR STUDENTS THAT WE

02:12:23.869 --> 02:12:24.469
NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE

02:12:24.536 --> 02:12:26.004
EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT'S BEST FOR

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:27.306
STUDENTS AND CERTAINLY I THINK

02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:29.875
THE DATA ON THIS IS IS IS

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:30.609
COMPELLING.

THAT -- THIS IS SOMETHING OUR

02:12:32.344 --> 02:12:33.879
STUDENTS NEED AND WE GOTTA

02:12:33.945 --> 02:12:34.713
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THEIR

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:36.181
SYSTEMS WORK WITH THIS SO THAT

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:37.482
WE'RE NOT WORKING AGAINST IT I

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:38.283
MEAN WE CAN TRY TO GET MORE

02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:39.584
PSYCHOLOGIST WE CAN DO MORE

02:12:39.651 --> 02:12:40.752
SCHOOL NURSES WE CAN DO

02:12:40.819 --> 02:12:42.387
EVERYTHING ELSE BUT WARY WORKING

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:44.056
AGAINST THE BIOLOGY.

02:12:44.122 --> 02:12:46.458
AND SO WITH THAT -- I'M STRONGLY --

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:47.693
NOW IS THAT I CAN GO OUT THERE

I FIND A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE --

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:10.816
COMPELLING GOT TO BALANCE THAT

02:13:10.882 --> 02:13:12.050
WITH LOCAL CONTROL WHICH IS

02:13:12.117 --> 02:13:14.086
SOMETHING I I STRONGLY BELIEVE

02:13:14.152 --> 02:13:16.088
AND BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS

02:13:16.154 --> 02:13:17.689
LAST WEEK IN THE ADDITIONAL

IT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED

02:13:22.761 --> 02:13:24.296
TO CONTINUE TO IT'S A VERY POOR

02:13:24.363 --> 02:13:24.830
NATION NEED TO HAVE THAT

02:13:24.896 --> 02:13:25.831
DISCUSSION.

02:13:25.897 --> 02:13:27.566
I HAVE TO GO BACK AND AND RE

02:13:27.632 --> 02:13:29.067
MEET WITH MY LOCAL SCHOOL

02:13:29.134 --> 02:13:31.103
DISTRICTS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM

02:13:31.169 --> 02:13:32.971
ARE OPPOSED TO IT SO MOBILE FOR

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:35.374
TODAY -- IF I GET A LOT OF PUSH

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.676
BACK AT HOME I RESERVE THE RIGHT

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:38.310
ON THE FLOOR TO DEVOTE THE OTHER

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:41.446
WAY BUT LET ME OBVIOUSLY.

02:13:41.513 --> 02:13:43.048
IT SHOULD BE STUDENTS FIRST AND

02:13:43.115 --> 02:13:44.249
SO I WANNA GO BACK AND TALK

02:13:44.316 --> 02:13:46.118
ABOUT THOSE IMPLEMENTATION

02:13:46.184 --> 02:13:46.485
ISSUES.

02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:49.287
AND IS EASY TO SAY NO BUT YOU

02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:50.322

02:13:50.389 --> 02:13:51.623
SO I'M GONNA GO BACK AND WORK ON

02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:56.261
THANK YOU SIR WELL OKAY THING

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:57.996
ELSE I JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE

02:13:58.063 --> 02:13:59.464
THE KIDS COMMITTEE ALSO KNOWS

02:13:59.531 --> 02:14:01.233
THAT I OFFERED AN AMENDMENT TO

02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:02.401
CENTER PORTANTINO WHICH SHE WAS

02:14:02.467 --> 02:14:03.668
NOT WILLING TO TAKE.

02:14:03.735 --> 02:14:05.837
BECAUSE THE SCIENCE ALSO SHOWS

02:14:05.904 --> 02:14:07.739
THAT LATE TEENS THAT IT WORKS

02:14:07.806 --> 02:14:09.207
BEST FOR PEOPLE IN THEIR LATE

02:14:09.274 --> 02:14:11.910
TEENS AND EARLY TWENTIES WHICH

02:14:11.977 --> 02:14:13.278
MAKES IT RIGHT FOR HIGH SCHOOL

02:14:13.345 --> 02:14:15.514
AND I ASKED HIM TO EXEMPT.

02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:17.482
MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR HIGHS

02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:19.050
SO THAT WAY IT WOULD MAKE IT

02:14:19.117 --> 02:14:21.253
WOULD EASE SOME OF THE

02:14:21.319 --> 02:14:23.722
TRANSPORTATION -- ISSUES.

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:25.190
AND YOU DO NOT WANT TAKE OUT SO

02:14:25.257 --> 02:14:27.125
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU COUNTER

02:14:27.192 --> 02:14:28.927
BACK WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT --

02:14:28.994 --> 02:14:30.295
WAS THE WASN'T FEASIBLE MY MIND

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:32.864
SO I DO FEEL LIKE WE'VE TRIED TO

02:14:32.931 --> 02:14:34.466
WORK ON THIS ISSUE -- BUT

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:35.801
THERE'S A LOT OF UNINTENDED

02:14:35.867 --> 02:14:37.536
CONSEQUENCES AND I JUST WISH

02:14:37.602 --> 02:14:39.671
THAT IT WE CAN WAVE A MAGIC WAND

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:41.239
AND MAKE IT EASY FOR EVERYONE.

02:14:41.306 --> 02:14:43.642
AND RESPECTFULLY -- DOCTOR PAN --

02:14:43.708 --> 02:14:44.976
WORKING WITH CORPORATE AMERICA

02:14:45.043 --> 02:14:45.977
FOR MANY YEARS IN THE LABOR

02:14:46.044 --> 02:14:47.712
MOVEMENT I DON'T THINK MOST WORK

02:14:47.779 --> 02:14:49.448
PLACES WILL JUST THEIR TIME FOR

02:14:49.514 --> 02:14:53.485
SCHOOLS I NEVER SAW THAT HAPPEN.

02:14:53.552 --> 02:14:55.854
SO WITH THAT -- CENTER POINT TWO

02:14:55.921 --> 02:14:57.489
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

02:14:57.556 --> 02:15:01.626
I I WOULD IN -- YES -- I I WILL

02:15:01.693 --> 02:15:02.994
ACKNOWLEDGE.

02:15:03.061 --> 02:15:03.929
THAT AND THE ANALYSIS DOES THE

02:15:03.995 --> 02:15:05.096
YOU -- OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:15:05.163 --> 02:15:06.431
EXEMPT OUT MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND I

02:15:06.498 --> 02:15:07.866
AND I BELIEVE I CAME UP.

02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:09.868
LET ME BACK UP I THINK THAT.

02:15:09.935 --> 02:15:11.937
THE CONCERN YOU HAD IS A

02:15:12.003 --> 02:15:13.638
LEGITIMATE CONCERN ABOUT GIVING

02:15:13.705 --> 02:15:15.740
DISTRICTS FLEXIBILITY TO TO

02:15:15.807 --> 02:15:18.210
STAGGER -- THEIR BUS SCHEDULE

02:15:18.276 --> 02:15:20.879
AND YOU KNOW I I BELIEVE

02:15:20.946 --> 02:15:22.814
ACTUALLY IF WE MADE MIDDLE AND

02:15:22.881 --> 02:15:24.349
MIDDLE SCHOOL SINGING AND JUNIOR

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:25.016
HIGHS.

02:15:25.083 --> 02:15:26.718
HAVE A MINIMUM STANDARD OF EIGHT

02:15:26.785 --> 02:15:28.119
O'CLOCK IN HIGH SCHOOLS EIGHT

02:15:28.186 --> 02:15:29.754
THIRTY I THINK.

02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:31.056
THAT ACCOMPLISHES THAT GOAL THAT

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:32.757
I WAS WILLING TO TO GO THERE AND

02:15:32.824 --> 02:15:34.693
I STILL LAUGH AND CONSIDERING

02:15:34.759 --> 02:15:35.994
THAT AMENDMENT AS THIS HOPEFULLY

02:15:36.061 --> 02:15:37.729
BILL MOVES OUT TODAY BECAUSE I

02:15:37.796 --> 02:15:39.865
THINK THAT IS A A LEGITIMATE

02:15:39.931 --> 02:15:41.099
QUESTION ASK THOUGH.

02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:42.834
FRANKLY THE DATA DOESN'T SHOW

02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:45.237
THAT THE TRANSPORTATION CROSS DO

02:15:45.303 --> 02:15:47.739
INCREASE -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW

02:15:47.806 --> 02:15:49.341
I DO APPRECIATE DR PANS CO

02:15:49.407 --> 02:15:50.709
AUTHORSHIP IN LEADERSHIP ON THIS

02:15:50.775 --> 02:15:53.912
IS A PEDIATRICIAN -- THE DATA IS

02:15:53.979 --> 02:15:55.780
CLEAR AND FRANKLY THAT THE

02:15:55.847 --> 02:15:57.482
CONSEQUENCES OF THE

02:15:57.549 --> 02:16:00.018
IMPLEMENTATION ARE POSITIVE -

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:02.354
AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT'S

02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:03.989
WHAT WE NEED TO FOLLOW IN THIS

02:16:04.055 --> 02:16:05.524
CASE YOU KNOW WE HAVE.

02:16:05.590 --> 02:16:08.059
A WAY TO POSITIVELY AFFECT

02:16:08.126 --> 02:16:09.461
PUBLIC HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN

02:16:09.528 --> 02:16:11.263
AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR ACADEMIC

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:13.431
PERFORMANCE -- A FORMER

02:16:13.498 --> 02:16:15.267
PRESIDENT -- WHO WAS A GOVERNOR

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:18.003
ONCE SAID THAT -- HIS BIGGEST

02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:19.804
FRUSTRATION WITH EDUCATION.

02:16:19.871 --> 02:16:21.172
WAS THAT EVERY PROBLEM IN

02:16:21.239 --> 02:16:23.341
EDUCATION HAS BEEN SOLVED ON A

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:24.643
CAMPUS SOMEWHERE.

02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:27.345
AND THE GOVERNOR WAS FRUSTRATED

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:28.446
BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE WAS

02:16:28.513 --> 02:16:30.148
DUPLICATING THAT SUCCESS BECAUSE

02:16:30.215 --> 02:16:32.083
SO MUCH OF WHAT MAKES THINGS

02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:33.652
WORK ON A PARTICULAR CAMPUS.

02:16:33.718 --> 02:16:34.953
ARE THE ART OF THE PEOPLE

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.087
INVOLVED AND IT'S HARD TO

02:16:36.154 --> 02:16:37.756
DUPLICATE.

02:16:37.822 --> 02:16:40.258
THAT PART -- AND WHAT MAKES ME

02:16:40.325 --> 02:16:42.160
EXCITED ABOUT LATE START IS THS

02:16:42.227 --> 02:16:44.362
IS A REPLICABLE DUPLICATE BOWL.

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:46.932
PROVEN WAY TO IMPROVE THE PUBLIC

02:16:46.998 --> 02:16:48.667
HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OUR

02:16:48.733 --> 02:16:50.201
CHILDREN AND ACADEMIC

02:16:50.268 --> 02:16:52.737
PERFORMANCE IT'S NOT ANECDOTE --

02:16:52.804 --> 02:16:55.206
IT'S NOT THEORY IT'S BORNE OUT

02:16:55.273 --> 02:16:58.143
BY DISTRICT AFTER DISTRICT ARE

02:16:58.209 --> 02:17:00.545
URBAN DISTRICTS SMALL DISTRICT --

02:17:00.612 --> 02:17:04.349
AND THE DATA SHOWS IT WORKS -- I

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:06.117
DO WANT TO COMMENT AGAIN ON THE

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:07.586
IMPACT ON LOW INCOME.

02:17:07.652 --> 02:17:09.087
CHILDREN AND WORKING FAMILY

02:17:09.154 --> 02:17:11.256
HOUSEHOLDS -- AGAIN THE DATA

02:17:11.323 --> 02:17:12.657
SHOWS THAT THEY SEE THE BIGGEST

02:17:12.724 --> 02:17:15.060
BENEFIT -- AFTER THE CHANGE IN

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:16.661
WITH THE SEATTLE MODEL WE KNOW

02:17:16.728 --> 02:17:17.195
THAT ATTENDANCE ACTUALLY

02:17:17.262 --> 02:17:18.129
INCREASED.

02:17:18.196 --> 02:17:20.031
DIDN'T DECREASE SO WHAT IS BEING

02:17:20.098 --> 02:17:21.733
USED AS A NEGATIVE IS ACTUALLY A

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:23.835
POSITIVE FOR THE BILL IN A FIGHT.

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:26.304
COULD CLOSE WITH COMMENTS FROM A

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:28.807
UNIVERSITY BERKELEY -- PROFESSOR

02:17:28.873 --> 02:17:29.774
AND HE WROTE I WRITE WITH

02:17:29.841 --> 02:17:31.876
DEEPEST SINCERITY IMPLORING YOU

02:17:31.943 --> 02:17:32.644
TO SUPPORT.

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:34.145
THE BILL TO DELAY SCHOOL START

02:17:34.212 --> 02:17:36.781
TIMES THE SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION

02:17:36.848 --> 02:17:38.383
AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:40.585
DATA ARE UNEQUIVOCAL BULL.

02:17:40.652 --> 02:17:42.120
AS HE DESCRIBES BELOW IN HIS

02:17:42.187 --> 02:17:44.189
LETTER THIS BILL IS A MISSION

02:17:44.255 --> 02:17:45.657
CRITICAL TO GIVING ADOLESCENCE

02:17:45.724 --> 02:17:47.225
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO SLEEP

02:17:47.292 --> 02:17:47.993
THEY NEED.

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:49.995
A MATTER WHAT PARENTS DO OR HOW

02:17:50.061 --> 02:17:51.296
MUCH THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP IS

02:17:51.363 --> 02:17:53.832
COMMUNICATED MOST TEENS SIMPLY

02:17:53.898 --> 02:17:55.667
CANNOT GET ENOUGH SLEEP.

02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:59.004
WITH EARLY START TIME AND HE

02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:00.438
CONCLUDED HIS LETTER.

02:18:00.505 --> 02:18:01.406
WITH -- THIS IS A LETTER SENT

02:18:01.473 --> 02:18:01.873
LAST YEAR.

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:04.109
AS YOU CAN SEE THE SCIENTIFIC

02:18:04.175 --> 02:18:05.977
MEASURABLE SLEEP DEFICIENCY IS

02:18:06.044 --> 02:18:07.345
SO DISASSOCIATED WITH EARLY

02:18:07.412 --> 02:18:09.547
SCHOOL START TIMES RESULTS IN

02:18:09.614 --> 02:18:10.482
MARKED.

02:18:10.548 --> 02:18:12.417
MENTAL PHYSICAL AN ACADEMIC

02:18:12.484 --> 02:18:15.120
DAMAGE HIS WORDS NOT MINE IF OUR

02:18:15.186 --> 02:18:17.922
GOAL AS EDUCATORS TRULY IS TO

02:18:17.989 --> 02:18:20.358
EDUCATE AND NOT RISK THE LIVES

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:21.693
IN THE PROCESS.

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:23.995
THEN I FEAR WE ARE FAILING OUR

02:18:24.062 --> 02:18:25.463
NEXT GENERATION WITH

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:27.832
UNSUSTAINABLE MODELS OF EARLY

02:18:27.899 --> 02:18:29.267
SCHOOL START TIME AND THAT WAS

02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:30.268
SIGNED BY.

02:18:30.335 --> 02:18:32.270
MATTHEW WALKER PHD PROFESSOR OF

02:18:32.337 --> 02:18:33.638

SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:18:36.908 --> 02:18:38.677
CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SO WE'VE

02:18:38.743 --> 02:18:40.979
UNITED BOTH STANFORD PROFESSORS

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:45.950
AND CAL PROFESSORS -- IN SUPPORT

TRIPS TO HEALTH CLINIC WHICH

02:26:47.298 --> 02:26:48.699

THAT CARE IN ACCESSIBLE. FOR THE

CAPACITY OF STUDENT HEALTH

ABORTION ON CAMPUS AND WHAT THEY

02:29:01.999 --> 02:29:03.034
WOULD NEED.

02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:04.735
ALL THE UC AND CSU STUDENT

02:29:04.802 --> 02:29:06.037

02:29:06.103 --> 02:29:07.738
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES THE

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:09.573
EMPLOYER CONTRACT WITH AT LEAST

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.776
ONE PHYSICIAN ON HAND OR A AN

ADVANCED PRACTICE CLINICIAN --

02:29:13.377 --> 02:29:14.512
AND THEY ALL HAVE THE NEEDED

02:29:14.578 --> 02:29:15.646
PHYSICAL SPACE.

02:29:15.713 --> 02:29:17.148
IN ORDER TO OFFER THE SERVICE

02:29:17.214 --> 02:29:18.683
THEY WOULD ALL NEED TRAINING ON

02:29:18.749 --> 02:29:20.685
THE ULTRASOUND IF THAT'S NEEDED --

02:29:20.751 --> 02:29:21.786
AND THEY WOULD ALSO NEED TWENTY

02:29:21.852 --> 02:29:22.887
FOUR HOUR TELEPHONE SUPPORT TO

ALREADY HAVE THAT.

02:29:27.358 --> 02:29:27.925
GIVEN THESE FINDINGS I BELIEVE

02:29:27.992 --> 02:29:28.559
THAT ABORTION KAREN CAMPUS IS

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:30.361
NECESSARY TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND

02:29:30.428 --> 02:29:32.029
DECREASED BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS

02:29:32.096 --> 02:29:33.364
AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WITH THE

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:34.432
FUNDING THAT'S BEEN COMMITTED IT

02:29:34.498 --> 02:29:36.133
WOULD BE VERY FEASIBLE. TO OFFER

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:37.501
MEDICATION ABORTION AT STUDENT

02:29:37.568 --> 02:29:39.503
HEALTH CENTERS THERE'S NO REASON

02:29:39.570 --> 02:29:40.938
TO EXCLUDE MEDICATION ABORTION

02:29:41.005 --> 02:29:42.640
CARE FROM THE SERVICES THAT ARE

02:29:42.707 --> 02:29:43.541

02:29:43.607 --> 02:29:44.375
CENTER.

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:45.643
AS SENATOR LABOR NOTED

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:47.244
MEDICATION ABORTION IS SAFE AND

02:29:47.311 --> 02:29:49.347
SIMPLE TO PROVIDE OVER THREE

02:29:49.413 --> 02:29:50.614
POINT SEVEN MILLION U. S. WOMEN

02:29:50.681 --> 02:29:51.782
HAVE HAD A MEDICATION ABORTION

02:29:51.849 --> 02:29:53.217
AND SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS ARE

02:29:53.284 --> 02:29:54.251
VERY RARE.

02:29:54.318 --> 02:29:55.653
IN FACT THE HEALTH RISKS ARE

02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:57.288
ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

02:29:57.355 --> 02:29:58.723
FOR WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO CONTINUE

FURTHER CONFIRMING THE AGENCY'S

02:30:12.303 --> 02:30:13.838

ABORTIONS IN THE RARE CASE OF A

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:21.045

02:30:21.112 --> 02:30:22.346
AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER

02:30:22.413 --> 02:30:23.748
RATHER THAN TRAVELING TO THE

02:30:23.814 --> 02:30:24.348

02:30:24.415 --> 02:30:25.082

FOR THE SEARCH FOR STUDENTS I

02:30:28.419 --> 02:30:29.687

02:30:29.754 --> 02:30:31.122
THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT

03:29:05.065 --> 03:29:06.200
SIMPLISTIC RIGHT A

03:29:06.267 --> 03:29:07.434
REPRESENTATION OF HOW THIS ON

03:29:07.501 --> 03:29:08.736
LINE SYSTEM.

03:29:08.802 --> 03:29:10.237
OF RATES CURRENTLY WORKS AND

03:29:10.304 --> 03:29:11.872
I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH HOW WE

PLAN TO REVISE THOSE RATES AND

03:29:14.041 --> 03:29:15.142
BRING THEM TOGETHER.

03:29:15.209 --> 03:29:16.744
IT'S KEY TO REMEMBER THAT THE

03:29:16.810 --> 03:29:18.178
LICENSED OR IN MARIN OR REGIONAL

03:29:18.245 --> 03:29:20.447

INCREASED COSTS.

03:29:34.795 --> 03:29:35.796
THE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF

MARKET RATE ALSO EXIST MOST

03:29:49.543 --> 03:29:51.578
IMPORTANTLY THE SYSTEM RELIES ON

03:29:51.645 --> 03:29:53.814
HISTORIC SNAPSHOT APPROACH WHICH

03:29:53.881 --> 03:29:55.616
IS ALMOST THREE YEARS OLD BEFORE

03:29:55.683 --> 03:29:57.551
THE NEW SNAPSHOT IS AVAILABLE.

03:29:57.618 --> 03:29:58.552
IT'S A MAJOR COST OF BUSINESS

03:29:58.619 --> 03:30:00.654
CHANGES LIKE MINIMUM WAGE

03:30:00.721 --> 03:30:02.556
INCREASES AND COST OF HEALTH

03:30:02.623 --> 03:30:05.759
CARE NEVER REFLECTED FOR YEARS.

03:30:05.826 --> 03:30:07.161
THE SURVEYS ALSO ALLOWED TO

03:30:07.227 --> 03:30:08.729
CAPTURE MARKET FAILURE CHILD

03:30:08.796 --> 03:30:10.364
CARE PROVIDERS IN DEEP POVERTY

03:30:10.431 --> 03:30:11.865
COMMUNITIES CAN ONLY CHARGE WITH

03:30:11.932 --> 03:30:13.467
THEIR MARKET WHICH IS THEIR

03:30:13.534 --> 03:30:15.369
NEIGHBORS CAN AFFORD TO PAY.

03:30:15.436 --> 03:30:17.705
THIS MARKET FAILURE IS AVERAGED

03:30:17.771 --> 03:30:19.840
INTO THE SURVEY'S RESULTS.

03:30:19.907 --> 03:30:20.474
SO AB.

03:30:20.541 --> 03:30:23.210
SB ONE SEVEN FOUR PROPOSES A

03:30:23.277 --> 03:30:24.979
SINGLE REGIONAL ICED

03:30:25.045 --> 03:30:27.014

LEARNING SERVICES THAT ONE

03:30:30.651 --> 03:30:31.919
COMPENSATES ALL TEACHERS AND

03:30:31.986 --> 03:30:33.954
PROVIDERS FOR THE TRUE COST OF

03:30:34.021 --> 03:30:36.590
PROVIDING CARE. TO RECOGNIZE IS

03:30:36.657 --> 03:30:38.292
THE COST OF MEETING EXISTING

03:30:38.359 --> 03:30:40.094
VARYING QUALITY STANDARDS THE

03:30:40.160 --> 03:30:41.662
STATE HAS PUT INTO PLACE IN

03:30:41.729 --> 03:30:43.130
ORDER TO DRIVE CHILD OUTCOMES

03:30:43.197 --> 03:30:44.431
AND SAFETY.

03:30:44.498 --> 03:30:46.600
AND THREE STABILIZES THE ABILITY

03:30:46.667 --> 03:30:47.901
OF THE STATE'S MIX DELIVERY

03:30:47.968 --> 03:30:49.470
SYSTEM TO PROVIDE QUALITY EARLY

03:30:49.536 --> 03:30:51.505
LEARNING OPTIONS WE ARE CALLING

03:30:51.572 --> 03:30:53.107
IT THE CHILD CARE STABILIZATION

03:30:53.173 --> 03:30:54.341
FORMULA.

03:30:54.408 --> 03:30:55.743
THE SINGLE REGIONALI STATE

03:30:55.809 --> 03:30:57.011
REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM FOR

03:30:57.077 --> 03:30:58.145
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION

03:30:58.212 --> 03:31:00.114
SERVICES WOULD HELP TO ENSURE

03:31:00.180 --> 03:31:01.515
THAT THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM IS

03:31:01.582 --> 03:31:03.684
MAINTAINED AS ONE EARLY LEARNING

03:31:03.751 --> 03:31:04.918

THE STANDARD SO THEY ARE

03:31:16.897 --> 03:31:18.165
REQUIRED TO MEET.

03:31:18.232 --> 03:31:18.799
AND SIGNIFICANTLY WE CAN LIKE

03:31:18.866 --> 03:31:19.666
WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

03:31:19.733 --> 03:31:21.769
FORMULA CREATE A FORMULA FOR

03:31:21.835 --> 03:31:22.936
CHILD CARE.

03:31:23.003 --> 03:31:25.339
THAT IS THE DRIVER FOR THE CHILD

03:31:25.406 --> 03:31:28.042
AND SYSTEM OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT.

03:31:28.108 --> 03:31:29.209
THE SECOND GRAPHIC YOU HAVE IN

03:31:29.276 --> 03:31:30.878
FRONT OF YOU IS A VERY SIMPLE

03:31:30.944 --> 03:31:33.147
DEPICTION OF SB ONE SEVENTY

03:31:33.213 --> 03:31:34.181
FORCE CONCEPTS.

03:31:34.248 --> 03:31:35.349
WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT YOU

03:31:35.416 --> 03:31:37.251
MAKE IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE

03:31:37.317 --> 03:31:38.852
REGIONAL MARKET RATE SYSTEM AND

03:31:38.919 --> 03:31:41.388
AND MAKE IT THE BASE OF THE

03:31:41.455 --> 03:31:42.456
SYSTEM.

03:31:42.523 --> 03:31:43.724
AND THEN ALIGN THE ENTIRE CHILD

03:31:43.791 --> 03:31:45.225
CARE SYSTEM TO THIS SINGLE

03:31:45.292 --> 03:31:46.827
TIERED REIMBURSEMENT RATE

IN THEIR COUNTY WE'RE CALLING

03:31:52.800 --> 03:31:54.001
THE BASE RATE.

03:31:54.068 --> 03:31:55.002
AND THEN PROVIDERS MEETING

03:31:55.069 --> 03:31:57.404
ADDITIONAL TITLE FIVE STANDARDS

03:31:57.471 --> 03:31:58.672
WOULD EARN THEIR COUNTIES BASE

03:31:58.739 --> 03:32:00.140

INCREASED REQUIREMENTS.

03:32:04.344 --> 03:32:05.212
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OUR

03:32:05.279 --> 03:32:07.014
GROUP I CALCULATED THE

03:32:07.081 --> 03:32:08.715
ADJUSTMENT FACTOR CONCEPT BASED

03:32:08.782 --> 03:32:10.317
OFF OF THE BIGGEST COST DRIVER

03:32:10.384 --> 03:32:11.351
BETWEEN THAT THE DIFFERENCE

03:32:11.418 --> 03:32:14.188
BETWEEN TITLE TWENTY TO ENTITLE --

03:32:14.254 --> 03:32:14.922

03:32:14.988 --> 03:32:16.123
CALCULATIONS PARTICULARLY

03:32:16.190 --> 03:32:18.025
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE PILOT

THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED -- EXPLAINS

03:32:32.539 --> 03:32:33.574
THE IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN EVER

03:32:33.640 --> 03:32:35.609
PROPOSAL RATHER THAN EXPECT THE

03:32:35.676 --> 03:32:37.644
STATE TO ABSORB THE COST OF THIS

03:32:37.711 --> 03:32:39.313
NEW RATE SYSTEM OVER ONE YEAR WE

03:32:39.379 --> 03:32:40.914
ARE PROPOSING LIKE THE LOCAL

03:32:40.981 --> 03:32:42.349
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

03:32:42.416 --> 03:32:43.417
THE STATE USE THIS NEW

03:32:43.484 --> 03:32:45.619
METHODOLOGY TO CREATE TARGETS

03:32:45.686 --> 03:32:47.521
FOR EACH TYPE OF CONTRACT BY

03:32:47.588 --> 03:32:48.155
COUNTY.

03:32:48.222 --> 03:32:50.224
MEN EACH YEAR THE BUDGET ACT IN

03:32:50.290 --> 03:32:51.592
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

03:32:51.658 --> 03:32:53.193
WILL DECIDE HOW MUCH FUNDING

03:32:53.260 --> 03:32:54.962
GOES TOWARDS RATE INCREASES FOR

03:32:55.028 --> 03:32:57.197
THE ENTIRE CHILD CARE SYSTEM.

03:32:57.264 --> 03:32:58.899
IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.

03:32:58.966 --> 03:32:59.833
AND THEN INCREASES WOULD BE

03:32:59.900 --> 03:33:01.502
DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY BASED OFF

03:33:01.568 --> 03:33:03.370
OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE

PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED

03:33:05.105 --> 03:33:08.142
AND THEIR TARGET AND THAT WOULD

03:33:08.208 --> 03:33:08.642
BE A YEAR BY YEAR BUDGET

03:33:08.709 --> 03:33:09.943

03:36:05.552 --> 03:36:06.620
UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY THE

03:36:06.687 --> 03:36:07.954
IMPLICATION STATEWIDE BUT FOR

03:36:08.021 --> 03:36:09.423
INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES AND CONTRACT

03:36:09.489 --> 03:36:10.257

AND IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM

03:36:12.225 --> 03:36:13.760
THAT THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS

03:36:13.827 --> 03:36:15.996
CURRENTLY IN THE BILL I IN FRONT

03:36:16.063 --> 03:36:17.931
OF YOU WOULD BE BETWEEN FIVE

03:36:17.998 --> 03:36:18.699
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION ANTS

03:36:18.765 --> 03:36:20.600

03:36:20.667 --> 03:36:20.867
DOLLARS.

03:36:20.934 --> 03:36:22.969
WHEN IT'S AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION

03:36:23.036 --> 03:36:24.371
OF THE REASON FOR THE RANGE IS

03:36:24.438 --> 03:36:26.840
BECAUSE WE DON'T FULLY KNOW WITH

03:36:26.907 --> 03:36:28.442
THE CHANGES TO THE ARE MORE

03:36:28.508 --> 03:36:29.676
SURVEY WOULD BE UNTIL THEY'RE

03:36:29.743 --> 03:36:30.310
DONE?

03:36:30.377 --> 03:36:30.911
SO THAT'S OUR ESTIMATE RAIN

03:36:30.977 --> 03:36:32.412
CHECK AND PART OF THE REASON

03:36:32.479 --> 03:36:33.480
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS OVER

03:36:33.547 --> 03:36:35.982
A MULTIPLE YEAR TRAJECTORY IS

03:36:36.049 --> 03:36:37.651
THERE ARE CHANGES THAT HAVE TO

03:36:37.718 --> 03:36:39.219
BE MADE TO THE REGIONAL MARKET

03:36:39.286 --> 03:36:41.555
RATE SURVEY. TO ALLOW THE FULL

03:36:41.621 --> 03:36:43.690
IMPLEMENTATION SO THIS GIVES THE

03:36:43.757 --> 03:36:45.559
STATE THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE

03:36:45.625 --> 03:36:48.962
THOSE FISCAL DECISIONS AS

03:36:49.029 --> 03:36:50.564
REVENUES ALLOW.

03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:51.865
OKAY AT BECAUSE THE REASON I

03:36:51.932 --> 03:36:52.466
ASKED THAT IS THATLOOK IF THE

03:36:52.532 --> 03:36:54.434
QUESTION WAS SHOULD WE ADD YOU

03:36:54.501 --> 03:36:55.702
KNOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE

03:36:55.769 --> 03:36:57.270
CHILDCARE SLOTS SHOULD WE PAY

03:36:57.337 --> 03:36:58.605
EVERYBODY MORE.

03:36:58.672 --> 03:36:59.940
IS THAT OF COURSE THE ANSWER

03:37:00.006 --> 03:37:01.541
WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY IT'S SUCH AN

03:37:01.608 --> 03:37:03.443
IMPORTANT THING.

03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:05.679
THAT -- THAT WE CAN HELP WITH --

03:37:05.746 --> 03:37:06.980
BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT WE

03:37:07.047 --> 03:37:08.081
HAVE TO MAKE THESE CHOICES

03:37:08.148 --> 03:37:09.583
WITHIN OUR BUDGET RIGHT AND I

03:37:09.649 --> 03:37:12.219
THINK THAT THE PART OF THIS THAT.

03:37:12.285 --> 03:37:13.587
I GUESS PAS GIVES ME PAUSE IS

03:37:13.653 --> 03:37:14.988
NOT REALLY THE RIGHT WORD JUST

03:37:15.055 --> 03:37:16.823
THAT IS TRYING TO BRING IT TO IS

03:37:16.890 --> 03:37:18.258
THE GROUND THIS IS THAT.

03:37:18.325 --> 03:37:19.960
WE'RE MAKING POLICY CHOICES HERE

03:37:20.026 --> 03:37:21.695
THAT.

03:37:21.762 --> 03:37:23.029
I I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND OR

03:37:23.096 --> 03:37:24.631
THEY OUGHT DO THEY CREATE THIS

03:37:24.698 --> 03:37:26.433
AUTOMATIC YOU KNOW IT THE

03:37:26.500 --> 03:37:27.234
QUESTION TO THAT YOU'RE NOT

03:37:27.300 --> 03:37:28.568
PUTTING BEFORE US WOULD USE

03:37:28.635 --> 03:37:30.737
WORDS LIKE UNIFICATION IT ON A

03:37:30.804 --> 03:37:31.371
LINE.

03:37:31.438 --> 03:37:32.806
THOSE ARE THOSE FOR ME AND

03:37:32.873 --> 03:37:33.340
THEY'RE TOUGH TO KIND OF

03:37:33.407 --> 03:37:35.609
UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE SAYING WE

03:37:35.675 --> 03:37:37.611
WANT TO PROVIDE RAISES. TO MORE

03:37:37.677 --> 03:37:39.813
ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE I GET THAT

03:37:39.880 --> 03:37:41.681
OKAY I GET THAT THAT'S CLEAR AND

03:37:41.748 --> 03:37:42.516
THAT'S NOT.

03:37:42.582 --> 03:37:43.316
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS THIS

03:37:43.383 --> 03:37:45.185
PRESENTATION A LITTLE CONFUSING

03:37:45.252 --> 03:37:47.087
TO ME HONESTLY IS THAT I I DON'T

03:37:47.154 --> 03:37:48.822
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE

03:37:48.889 --> 03:37:50.757
TERMS MEAN.

03:37:50.824 --> 03:37:51.725
IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT ONLY PAY

03:37:51.792 --> 03:37:53.427
SOMEBODY IN FRESNO DIFFERENTLY

03:37:53.493 --> 03:37:54.728
OR THE SAME AS SOMEONE LOS

03:37:54.795 --> 03:37:56.029
ANGELES THAT'S UNFAIR TO PEOPLE

03:37:56.096 --> 03:37:58.098
IN LOS ANGELES IF THAT'S WHAT

03:37:58.165 --> 03:37:58.698
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OKAY I I

03:37:58.765 --> 03:37:59.599
GET THAT.

03:37:59.666 --> 03:38:00.534
AND YOU CAN WE WANT TO

03:38:00.600 --> 03:38:01.802
INCORPORATE THE COST OF LIVING

03:38:01.868 --> 03:38:05.772
IN THAT CITY THAT THAT'S WHAT

03:38:05.839 --> 03:38:06.406
YOU'RE DOING THAT'S CLEAR TO ME

03:38:06.473 --> 03:38:08.375
OKAY -- BUT I I AM FINDING THIS

03:38:08.442 --> 03:38:09.409
A LITTLE HARD TO GET MY MY HEAD

03:38:09.476 --> 03:38:10.343
AROUND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU

03:38:10.410 --> 03:38:11.278
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT AN ISSUE A

03:38:11.344 --> 03:38:12.646
PHILOSOPHICALLY ALIGNED WITH

03:38:12.712 --> 03:38:14.714
WHAT YOU WANT.

03:38:14.781 --> 03:38:16.616
MORE SLOTS BETTER PAY.

03:38:16.683 --> 03:38:18.452
YOU KNOW -- A SENSITIVITY TO THE

03:38:18.518 --> 03:38:20.787
MARKET PLACE AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE

03:38:20.854 --> 03:38:22.155
DOING AYE AYE.

03:38:22.222 --> 03:38:23.123
THAT'S THAT'S EASY FOR ME BUT

03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:24.057
I'M JUST SHARING THAT BECAUSE IT

03:38:24.124 --> 03:38:25.525
IT'S A GREAT POINT CENTER GLAZER

03:38:25.592 --> 03:38:26.960
AND I THINK THE EXAMPLES THAT

03:38:27.027 --> 03:38:28.728
YOU JUST GAVE GAVE ME SOMETHING

03:38:28.795 --> 03:38:29.930
TO WORK ON IF THIS BILL GETS OUT

03:38:29.996 --> 03:38:31.765
OF THIS COMMITTEE ON THE NEXT

03:38:31.832 --> 03:38:34.534
COMMITTEE HITS -- I THINK PART

03:38:34.601 --> 03:38:36.236
MAYBE THIS WILL BE HELPFUL TO

03:38:36.303 --> 03:38:37.838
YOU HAVE THE RMR RATE WHICH IS

03:38:37.904 --> 03:38:39.406
THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE AND

03:38:39.473 --> 03:38:41.308
THEN YOU HAVE THE S. AS THE S.

03:38:41.374 --> 03:38:42.909
R. OUR RATE THE STANDARD

03:38:42.976 --> 03:38:43.376
REIMBURSEMENT RATE.

03:38:43.443 --> 03:38:45.345
AND THEY'RE DONE DIFFERENTLY SO

03:38:45.412 --> 03:38:46.346
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS

03:38:46.413 --> 03:38:47.581
BILL AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF

03:38:47.647 --> 03:38:49.015
I'M WRONG IS WE'RE TRYING TO

03:38:49.082 --> 03:38:50.016
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO BOTH OF

03:38:50.083 --> 03:38:51.384
THOSE REIMBURSEMENT RATES THE

03:38:51.451 --> 03:38:52.319
SAME WAY.

03:38:52.385 --> 03:38:53.587
BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

03:38:53.653 --> 03:38:54.855
SAYING THAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

WORKING ON A QUITE A BIT HAS

03:41:52.332 --> 03:41:54.367

03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:15.922
BEEN STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH

03:42:15.989 --> 03:42:19.392
A WINNING FORMULA -- ALONG THE

03:42:19.459 --> 03:42:22.162

YOU WANNA LOOK AT OUR WEBSITE

03:54:27.787 --> 03:54:29.889

AGAIN OUR OUR VIEW THAT THIS IS

03:54:38.230 --> 03:54:39.732
AN APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:54:39.799 --> 03:54:41.600
EMPLOYEES WE NOTE THAT --

03:54:41.667 --> 03:54:44.170
LOOKING AT PAST SEPARATION DATA

03:54:44.236 --> 03:54:45.171
FOR SOME OF OUR LOWER WAGE

03:54:45.237 --> 03:54:48.007

03:54:48.073 --> 03:54:49.241

NINE TO LOW 40% OR HIGHER.

03:54:54.780 --> 03:54:56.949
AND SO WHAT WE'VE GOT IS FOLKS

03:54:57.016 --> 03:54:59.385
WHO PERHAPS MAY NOT INTEND TO BE

03:54:59.452 --> 03:55:00.553

03:55:00.619 --> 03:55:01.787
FOR THE ENTIRE THEIR CAREERS AND

03:55:01.854 --> 03:55:04.323
IN THAT CASE THE DC PLAN

03:55:04.390 --> 03:55:05.624
ACTUALLY BENEFITS THEM.

03:55:05.691 --> 03:55:07.092
IT BENEFITS THEM BECAUSE IF THEY

03:55:07.159 --> 03:55:08.594
CHOOSE THE DP.

03:55:08.661 --> 03:55:10.696
THEY'VE GOT TO BE IN IN --

03:55:10.763 --> 03:55:12.164
UNIVERSE IMPLEMENT FOR FIVE

03:55:12.231 --> 03:55:14.567

03:55:18.304 --> 03:55:19.905
AFTER JUST ONE YEAR.

03:55:19.972 --> 03:55:22.608
AND THEN LASTLY -- WE WOULD

03:55:22.675 --> 03:55:24.109
AGAIN ARGUE THAT -- FOR

03:55:24.176 --> 03:55:25.411

RODRIGUEZ I FIRST WANT TO

04:14:06.698 --> 04:14:08.132
JUVENILE HALL WHEN I WAS TWELVE

04:14:08.199 --> 04:14:09.767
YEARS OLD AND IN SEVENTH GRADE.

04:14:09.834 --> 04:14:10.902
I GOT OUT FOR A MONTH AND THEN

04:14:10.969 --> 04:14:13.705
WENT BACK IN AND LITERALLY DID

04:14:13.771 --> 04:14:14.472

WELL I WAS IN THE CAMP EDUCATION

04:14:18.576 --> 04:14:19.911
WAS SO HARD FOR ME IT WAS ONE

04:14:19.978 --> 04:14:21.212
CURRICULUM FOR EVERYONE AND I

04:14:21.279 --> 04:14:22.246
WAS LEARNING WHAT OTHER GIRLS

04:14:22.313 --> 04:14:24.649
WERE LEARNING EVEN THOUGH THEY

04:14:24.716 --> 04:14:25.149
WERE MUCH OLDER.

04:14:25.216 --> 04:14:26.084
THEN A LOT OF THE GIRLS

04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:27.018
GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHILE

04:14:27.085 --> 04:14:28.419
THEY WERE STILL INCUSTODY.

04:14:28.486 --> 04:14:29.654
AND AFTER THE GRADUATION THEY

04:14:29.721 --> 04:14:30.855
STILL CAME TO COURT SCHOOL WITH

04:14:30.922 --> 04:14:32.123
THOSE BUT THEY SAT IN THE BACK

04:14:32.190 --> 04:14:33.391
OF THE CLASSROOM AND DID NOTHING

04:14:33.458 --> 04:14:34.959
BUT COLORING AND WRITING IN

04:14:35.026 --> 04:14:35.727
JOURNALS.

04:14:35.793 --> 04:14:37.095
OR WRITING LETTERS OR THEY WENT

04:14:37.161 --> 04:14:38.496
OUTSIDE IN THE GARDEN THEY HAD

04:14:38.563 --> 04:14:39.897
NOTHING TO STUDY NOTEBOOKS ARE

04:14:39.964 --> 04:14:41.432
EDUCATION PROGRAMS WERE OFFERED

04:14:41.499 --> 04:14:42.500
TO THEM.

04:14:42.567 --> 04:14:43.501
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FOR

04:14:43.568 --> 04:14:45.837
BECAUSE I BECAME CLOSE TO THOSE

04:14:45.903 --> 04:14:47.005
GIRLS AND I NEED THEIR POTENTIAL.

04:14:47.071 --> 04:14:48.439
THEY TELL ME THE GOALS AND THE

04:14:48.506 --> 04:14:49.941

NO HOPE FOR US WHO IS GOING TO

04:14:55.446 --> 04:14:56.247
HELP US.

04:14:56.314 --> 04:14:57.248
IT DIDN'T GIVE ME MOTIVATION

04:14:57.315 --> 04:14:58.616
BECAUSE THESE INTELLIGENT GIRLS

04:14:58.683 --> 04:14:59.651
HAD JUST FINISHED HER HIGH

04:14:59.717 --> 04:15:01.719
SCHOOL EDUCATION AND THERE WAS

04:15:01.786 --> 04:15:03.021
NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO WHAT THAT.

04:15:03.087 --> 04:15:03.655
WE TALKED ABOUT THEM GOING TO

04:15:03.721 --> 04:15:05.256

04:15:05.323 --> 04:15:06.891
HELP.

04:15:06.958 --> 04:15:07.959
BUT THEY GOT NOTHING TO HELP

04:15:08.026 --> 04:15:09.293
THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT

04:15:09.360 --> 04:15:10.862
WHILE THEY WERE STILL INSIDE NO

04:15:10.928 --> 04:15:13.131
RESOURCES NO REAL OPPORTUNITY.

04:15:13.197 --> 04:15:15.800
