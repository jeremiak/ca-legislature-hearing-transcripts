THIS ISSUE THOUGH. ACROSS THE

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.592
STATE THIS. THING WRONG SMALL

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.928
SCHOOL. RIGHT THE DISTRICTS HAVE

TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT RIGHT

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:15.599
NOW. DISTRICTS CANNOT AFFORD

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:20.604
SMALL SCHOOLS. SO WE NEED TO DO.

00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:21.672
AND BUDGET BECAUSE THE MONEY

00:47:21.738 --> 00:47:23.473
WILL BE THERE AND THAT'S ONGOING

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.108
MONEY. TO ADD TO THE BASE. .

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:26.510
GOVERNOR'S OFFER A PROPOSAL THIS

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:28.145
WILL CHANGE IS FIVE POINT THREE

THREE WILL. THE NAME BE

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:30.681
INFLATION. NOR'EASTERS A PURSE

00:47:30.747 --> 00:47:32.182
COSTS THERE OTHER COST PRESSURES

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:33.650
ON DISTRICT PLANNING ROMAN

00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:36.587
EXETER. RIGHT WE REALLY NEED TO

00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:39.022
RAISE THAT BASE TO KIND OF STAVE

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:40.791
OFF. SOME OF THE SITUATIONS- THE

00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:42.226
SITUATION IF YOU WILL THAT'S

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:43.393
OCCURRING IN YOUR DISTRICT

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.428
BECAUSE- IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:46.330
EITHER WAY. BUT THE SAME TIME IT

00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:48.432
CAN BE LESSENED IF DISTRICTS ARE

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:48.999
BETTER FINANCED. BECAUSE IT

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:49.566
THEIR DISTRICTS ARE MAKING

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:51.168
FINANCIAL. ISSUES WHICH HAVE

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:53.170
HUMAN IMPACT SO I APPRECIATE

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:54.471

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:57.040
DISTRICT HERE TODAY AND I HAVE

00:47:57.107 --> 00:47:57.941
BEEN IN THE PAST. AND APPRECIATE

00:47:58.008 --> 00:47:59.243
THE BILL. ARE THERE ARE OTHERS

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:01.745
ON THE COMMITTEE THAT WISH TO

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:03.247
COMMENT IS QUIRK-SILVA. THANK

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:04.982
YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:07.384
AND- I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:10.554
THE CHAIR ABOUT- ISSUE SIMILAR

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:11.989
TO THIS I MEAN WHAT WE ALREADY

00:48:12.055 --> 00:48:14.091
KNOW IS THE DATA THAT SHOWS.

00:48:14.157 --> 00:48:15.726
THAT NOT ONLY IS DECLINING

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:18.962
ENROLLMENT REAL IT'S NOT JUST A-

00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:21.031
SHORT PERIOD IT'S BEEN LONG TERM

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:23.834
NOW- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.402
OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:26.803
ALSO CHOOSING NOT TO HAVE

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:27.638
CHILDREN. THAT'S ANOTHER FACTOR

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:29.573
THAT WILL PLAY INTO THIS. BUT

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.476
THE OTHER QUESTION IS HOW SMALL

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:34.244
IS TOO SMALL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:36.446
IT. X. I HAVE SOME DISTRICTS

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:38.515
THAT ARE. LITERALLY UNDER FIVE

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:41.518
THOUSAND- STUDENTS THAT ARC THAT

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:44.321
WERE FIVE THOUSAND NOW CLOSER TO

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:46.657
THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED SO. I THINK.

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:48.058
THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT BUT

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:49.192
ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO ASK

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:51.094
ABOUT THIS I. DEFINITELY SUPPORT

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:52.596
THIS BILL IS ON THE EQUITY

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:55.399
IMPACT ANALYSIS. IS ONE OF THE

00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:57.167
THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND

00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:59.436
MANY MANY YEARS AS A TEACHER. IS

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:01.972
SOMETIMES ARE COMMUNITIES. OF

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:04.841
COLOR- AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO THE

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:05.942

TRANSPORTATION ACCESS WHATEVER

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:13.150
THE REASONS. WE DON'T ALWAYS GET

00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:14.751
THEM. AT WHETHER IT'S THE BOARD

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:17.087
MEETING SO HOW IS THE OUT REACH

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:19.656
GOING TO BE MADE TO THEM TO MAKE

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:22.759
SURE. THAT THEIR INPUT IS REALLY

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:24.861

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:38.375
THAT KIND OF OUTRAGE THAT NEEDS

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:40.310
TO HAPPEN FOR COMMUNITIES

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:40.877
PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:43.513
COLOR IS WHY WE END UP WITH DIRE

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.981
SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:46.183

00:49:46.249 --> 00:49:47.918
THE LINE AND- HUNGER STRIKING

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:49.186

OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON CHRONIC

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:08.189
DISEASE PREVENTION AMONG

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.291
CHILDREN WITH PARTICULAR

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:11.826
EXPERTISE ON DRINKING WATER IN

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:14.195
SCHOOLS. I'M TODAY I'LL TELL YOU

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:15.463
THREE REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.032
VERY IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THIS

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.867
BILL FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:20.235
LEARNING. FIRST I'M TO PROMOTE

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.569
HEALTH WE WANT STUDENTS TO DRINK

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.872
WATER NOT SUGARY DRINKS. WE KNOW

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:25.073
THAT DRINKING WATER INSTEAD OF

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.675
SUGARY BEVERAGES CAN HELP TO

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.276
DECREASE OBESITY AS WELL AS

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:29.811
PREVENT DENTAL CARIES. AND

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.780
EITHER TWO OF THE MOST COMMON

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:32.981
CHRONIC CONDITIONS AMONG YOUNG

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:35.617
CHILDREN. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:37.686
36% OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.220
WERE OVERWEIGHT TENNIS IS

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:41.856
INCREASE OF STAND TO LEAD A 46%

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:43.725
OVER THE PANDEMIC PERIOD. I'M

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.794
THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.628
TO ADDRESS IN ADDITION WE KNOW

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.430
THAT PROVIDING WATER TO STUDENTS

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:50.498
IMPROVE THEIR COGNITION. WHICH

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:51.599
IS IMPORTANT FOR LEARNING.

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.234
SECOND CHILDREN SPEND

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:54.502
SUBSTANTIAL TIME IN SCHOOL

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:56.971
SETTINGS. WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:57.639
PARTICULARLY THOSE OF COLOR

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.574
UNDER HYDRATED. IN A STUDY OF

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.543
LOS ANGELES STUDENTS WE FOUND

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.211
THAT SIXTY THREE PERCENT. OF

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:05.080
STUDENTS WERE UNDER HYDRATED AND

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.614
WE KNOW THAT WATER FOUNTAINS

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:07.782
WHEN THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:09.584
STUDENTS DON'T USE THEM. IN OUR

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.553
STUDIES 326% OF STUDENTS WERE

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:14.856
USING- CONTENTS AT SCHOOLS. AT

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:17.092

INSTALL THESE WATER BOTTLE

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:19.661
FILLING STATIONS. THEY ACTUALLY

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:21.663
PROMOTE INCREASED WATER INTAKE

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.732
AMONG STUDENTS. WE HAVE ONE

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:24.833
STUDY COULD THAT WE JUST

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.668
COMPLETED ACTUALLY. IN BAY AREA

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.436
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND THIS WAS

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.238
A STUDY. THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:32.273
THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.475
WHAT WE FOUND IN THAT STUDY WAS

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:35.210
THAT. IN SCHOOLS FOR STUDENTS

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:36.878
HAD ACCESS TO NEWLY INSTALLED

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:39.447
WATER STATIONS. THEIR ODDS OF

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:41.182
BEING OVERWEIGHT REDUCED BY

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:43.351
SEVENTY PERCENT. SO IN SOME I

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:45.353

MANY MANY HIGH SCHOOLS I SHOULD

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.390
NOTE DO INCORPORATE FINANCIAL

01:29:56.457 --> 01:29:58.259

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:02.029
SO THAT IS A GOOD THING- BUT

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:03.331
THEY NEED SOME HELP. NEED SOME

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:05.733

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.141
IN THE INVESTMENT CONTACTS AND

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:15.510
AGAINST YOU AND IN THAT CONTEXT

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:16.677
UNDERSTANDING HOW TO BALANCE

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.379
CHECKBOOK UNDERSTAND THE TIME

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:19.680
VALUE OF MONEY. UNDERSTANDING

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:21.549
CERTAIN BASIC THINGS ABOUT

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.851
CREDIT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:25.386
CREDIT REPORTING IMPORTANT TO

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:27.555
MAINTAIN A GOOD CREDIT SCORE TO

DO- THOSE ARE BASIC LIFE SKILLS

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:35.997
IN MY VIEW IT'S SIMILAR TO

01:30:36.063 --> 01:30:38.232
HEALTH CLASS IN BASIC NUTRITION

01:30:38.299 --> 01:30:39.834

TO READ WRITE. FACT BILLION. SO

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:45.706
FORTH. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY I

01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:47.308
THINK THIS IS A GOOD. WAY TO DO

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:49.377
IT BECAUSE IF WE CAN GET MONEY

01:30:49.443 --> 01:30:51.212
APPROPRIATED AT WHETHER IT'S

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:52.880
THIS YEAR OR IN THE FUTURE YEAR

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.415
THAN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:55.316
BE INCREASING THE POP THE-

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:56.450
INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF FUNDS

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:57.552
THAT CAN BE USED. AND IT'S A

01:30:57.618 --> 01:31:00.188
VERY SMALL INVESTMENT IN TERMS

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:01.823
OF DOLLAR TERMS BUT- IN TERMS OF

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:03.858

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:05.519

PROPERTY ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:17.731
HAS TO BE TUCKED IN. AND PEOPLE

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:18.499
NEED TOOLS TO TEACH THAT A BASIC

01:37:18.566 --> 01:37:19.366
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:21.569
HIGHLIGHTED TO- BUT ALSO TOOLS

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:22.503
TO TEACH THAT THAT THAT'S REALLY

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:25.139
WHAT I WOULD NEED. IN A

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:26.373
CLASSROOM IN A WAY THAT ENGAGES

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.909
STUDENTS NOW NOT JUST YOU KNOW

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:33.814
READ YOU GOT A LIMIT. RIGHT SO I

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:34.982
APPRECIATE THAT MR BENNETT.

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:35.916
THANK YOU FOR MUCH A MISTER

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:36.817
CHAIR. ON AFTER SPENDING MORE

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:38.586
THAN TWENTY YEARS THE TEACHING

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:40.955
OF REQUIRED ECONOMICS COURSE. IN

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:43.691
HIGH SCHOOLS. I WOULD JUST OFFER

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:46.193
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT EVERY

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.028
STUDENT NEEDS. MUCH MORE AND

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:51.131
BETTER. FINANCIAL LITERACY. AND

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:53.667
THE ECONOMICS COURSES THE PROPER

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:55.636
PLACE TO DO IT. I THINK THE

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:56.704
CHALLENGE IS. GETTING IT TO

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:59.006
HAPPEN IN THE- COMICS COURSE.

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.141
AND THAT IS WHERE I THINK WE

01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:04.278
REALLY STILL NEED WORK. AND THAT

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:07.448
IS IT SHOULD NOT BE UP TO THE

01:38:07.514 --> 01:38:09.049
TEACHER. WHETHER THEY ARE GOING

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:11.018
TO ARE NOT GOING TO TEACH THE

01:38:11.085 --> 01:38:13.053
FINANCIAL LITERACY COMPONENTS.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.455
THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL FOR

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:16.790
CHILDREN TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND

01:38:16.857 --> 01:38:19.426
RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT FRANKLY THAT

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:22.062
IS THE CASE. THERE IS NOT REALLY

01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:24.732
A WAY FOR US TO ESTABLISH THAT

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.734
ACCOUNTABILITY. I KNOW SOME

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.837
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT MMHM MANY

01:38:29.903 --> 01:38:33.540
TEACHERS ARE RELUCTANT TO TEACH

01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:35.409
GOVERNMENT AND SO WHAT THEY'VE

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:36.877
DONE IS THEY'VE TAKEN THEIR

01:38:36.944 --> 01:38:38.445
GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMICS ONE

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:40.614
SEMESTER REQUIREMENT FOR REACH

01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:42.750
AND THEY DO SO THREE QUARTERS OF

01:38:42.816 --> 01:38:45.452
GOVERNMENT AND THEN TRY TO

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:47.288
SQUEEZE THE ECONOMICS IN AND ONE

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:50.791
QUARTER THEY DO THAT. PLACIDA

01:38:50.858 --> 01:38:52.126
BUT AND SAY THAT'S THAT'S GOOD

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:55.629
ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO FIND A WAY

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:56.930
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.766
ARE READY MANDATE ECONOMICS THAT

01:38:58.832 --> 01:39:01.001
WAS. THE BATTLE FOUGHT PEOPLE

01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:03.337
THOUGHT THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR.

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:07.007
THIS LITERACY FOR STUDENTS BUT

01:39:07.074 --> 01:39:09.009
IT IS NOT WHAT MANY TEACHERS

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:10.344
HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH AND

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:12.313
SO I THINK WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT

01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:14.848
TOOL HERE WHICH IS MAKE TEACHERS

01:39:14.915 --> 01:39:16.717
MORE COMFORTABLE BUT THERE ALSO

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.018
NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:19.820
THAT COMPONENT THE ECONOMICS

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.789
COURSE IS TAUGHT AND TAUGHT

01:39:21.855 --> 01:39:25.426
WELL. IT IS. YOUNG PEOPLE FUTURE

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:28.362
SO ARE YOU KNOW LITERALLY CAN BE

01:39:28.429 --> 01:39:30.664
RUINED BY THE TIME THEY'RE

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:33.300
TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO. NUMBER

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:38.739
ONE.

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.374
AND IF YOUGET IN THE WRONG

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.942
HABITS IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:44.378
OUT OF THAT HABIT OF- DOING THAT

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:48.015
SO THIS ISN'T. A BE ALL A CURE

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:50.084
ALL BUT IT IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:52.119
STEP TO GETTING FURTHER ALONG IN

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:53.554
SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.356
SEE THAT WE STILL HAVEN'T

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:56.690
CALIFORNIA WELCOME THE STAFF.

01:39:56.757 --> 01:40:00.194
GRADUATING AND CAN. YOU FOR-

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:03.130
STEPPING UP- WITH FREE RESOURCES

01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:04.531
FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AND IF

01:40:04.598 --> 01:40:07.835
I CAN JUST JUMP IN I THINK I

01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:08.936
THINK THE VALUE OF THE COURSE

01:40:09.002 --> 01:40:10.371
IS. THE ISSUE OF ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:11.505
BECAUSE IT IS EMBEDDED IN

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:12.740
ANOTHER COURSE IN HIS RESEARCH

01:40:12.806 --> 01:40:13.874
OUT THERE THAT SUGGEST ABOUT

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:15.275
HALF THE TIME WHEN IT'S EMBEDDED

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:17.111
IN OTHER COURTS IS NOT TAUGHT.

01:40:17.177 --> 01:40:18.712
RIGHT RIGHT IT MIGHT BE IN THE

01:40:18.779 --> 01:40:20.414
STANDARDS BUT- MANY TEACHERS ARE

01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:22.282
COMFORTABLE WITH THE ECONOMICS.

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:23.984
SO THAT EACH ECONOMICS AND-

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:25.886
THAT'S WHAT WE FIND AGAIN 70% OF

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:27.588
KIDS NATIONWIDE. ATTEND SCHOOL

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:30.224
THAT HAS AN ELECTIVE 25%

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:32.292
CALIFORNIA. I'M GONNA ON BOTH

01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:33.761
YOU SAY THIS IS AN

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:35.129
ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM. THIS IS

01:40:35.195 --> 01:40:36.196
THE DUTY OF A SCHOOL

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:37.431
ADMINISTRATOR DISTRICT

01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:39.199
ADMINISTRATION. TO MAKE SURE

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:40.701
SCHOOLS ARE TEACHING WHAT

01:40:40.768 --> 01:40:43.003
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO TEACH- THEY

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:44.638
ARE SUPPOSED TO TEACH US IN

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:45.406
THEIR ECONOMICS COURSE. I THINK

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:47.341
IT MAY BE THAT PEOPLE AFRAID OF

01:40:47.408 --> 01:40:48.475
IT BECAUSE MAYBE THEY DON'T

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:49.843
UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES AS BEEN

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:52.246
HIGHLIGHTED OR MAYBE. THEY DON'T

01:40:52.312 --> 01:40:54.114
HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO DO IT. OR

01:40:54.181 --> 01:40:55.949
DO YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES ARE

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:57.317
THERE. THE RESOURCES ARE THERE

01:40:57.384 --> 01:40:59.453

I'M GONNA GO LOOK AT THIS

01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:06.427

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:07.961
AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. I WAS

01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:11.465
PRETTY MUCH DEVELOPING- I DIDN'T

I'M GONNA GO TO THAT WEBSITE SO

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:17.838
I THINK AND IT MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:19.373
COULD I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.340
YOU ADMINISTRATORS THAT'S THAT

01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:21.442
THEIR PRIMARY FUNCTION NOT TO BE

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:22.376
TO MAKE SURE TEACHERS ARE

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:24.478
TEACHING WELL AND TEACHING WITH

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:26.480
THEIR ASSIGNED TO IT AND THEN

OFTEN TEACHERS ARE COMPLETELY

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:32.453
LEFT- ON THAT ISSUE AND THEN

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:34.188
TEACHERS STILL HAVE TO MAKE THE

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:35.622
PROFESSIONALS OF ALL OF THE

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:38.492
