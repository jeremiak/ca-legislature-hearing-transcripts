BE ALSO A SUGGESTION FOR ALL

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.983
COLLEAGUES DOING THE WORK IS TO

00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:19.917
REALLY HAVE RESEARCH THAT'S

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:20.551
GROUNDED.

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:27.124
AND REAL OF FOR OUR COLLEAGUES.

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:28.058
HOW?

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.527
NOW IN LIGHT OF OUR KNOWING THAT

00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:30.194
THIS IS COMPELLING THE QUESTION

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:31.862
IS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:33.998
DO THIS IN LIGHT OF PROP.

00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:35.599
TWO OH NINE AS YOU SEE AND SLIDE --

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:39.270
SET AT SIX OUTSIDE SEVEN YEARS

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:41.138
PROP TWO ALL NINE OF AS YOU WE

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:43.274
KNOW WAS A STUDENT INITIATIVE

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.142
THAT BASICALLY SAID WE SHALL NOT

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:47.211
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST OR GRANT

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:48.846
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT BASED ON

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:50.347
RACE AND IN THE CONVERSATION WE

00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:51.615
HAVE TODAY.

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:53.050
IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:56.053
EDUCATION A BILL TO TALK ABOUT

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.289
FACULTY DIVERSITY WITHIN THE

00:40:58.355 --> 00:41:00.457
CONCEPT OF PROP.

00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:01.525
TWO OH NINE AND WHAT'S CRITICAL

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:03.127
IS THE NEXT SLIDE AND IT'S

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:04.662
SOMETHING WHEN I WAS IN TRUMP

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:06.130
GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE STATE

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:07.898
SYSTEM COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:09.333
OFFICE CANCERS OFFICE.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.669
IT WAS THE FRAMEWORK AND

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:14.471
COMMUNICATION THAT I DID IN --

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.040
TRAINING OUR COLLEAGUES UP AND

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:18.642
DOWN THE STATE AND THAT IS IT'S

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:21.045
TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN.

00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:23.080
SO ONE SIDE OF THE COIN IS

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:25.683
DEFINITELY ANTI DISCRIMINATION

00:41:25.749 --> 00:41:27.184
LAWS AND POP TOOL NINE THAT'S

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:27.952
VERY CLEAR.

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:30.120
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN

00:41:30.187 --> 00:41:31.222
IS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT

00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:34.124
OPPORTUNITIES AND THE NEED TO

00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:35.259
PROMOTE INCLUSION.

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:36.961
IT'S THE SAME SIDE OF THE SAME

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:38.963
IT'S THE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME

00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:40.064
COIN.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.532
KNOW WHY IS THIS CRITICAL.

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:45.269
AS UC BERKELEY'S DEAN IRWIN

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:46.303
SHIMMERING SKIER PREMIER

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.639
CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR HAS SAID

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:50.441
WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH PROP TWO

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:51.876
OH NINE IS WE HAVE.

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:53.911
BEEN PARALYZED IT MANY TIMES

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:55.379
EVEN AT THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:56.480
PROP TWO ONE NINE WAS PUT IN

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:58.749
PLACE AND QUITE FRANKLY EVEN AS

00:41:58.816 --> 00:42:00.351
OF THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS AT

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:01.719
THE STATE'S SYSTEM OFFICE IN

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:03.254
DOING THE TRAINING.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.688
AND GETTING LOCAL --

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:06.423
COLLEGE DISTRICT TRUSTEES TO

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.959
VOTE ONFACULTY DIVERSITY AS A

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:09.493
CRITICAL.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.895
ELEMENT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:11.862
ARE AFRAID OF EVEN USING THE

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.397
WORD DIVERSITY.

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:14.832
AND AFRAID THAT THAT CONCEPT

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:17.801
ITSELF IS A VIOLATION OF PROP

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:21.572
TWO OH NINE AND THAT IS NOT TRUE --

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:24.608
AND SO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OF

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:26.644
THE SAME COIN AND CONSIDERING

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.946
THE PARALYSIS OF ANALYSIS OF

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:30.214
PROP TWO OH NINE OUT QUITE

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:32.182
FRANKLY I THINK WE NEED TO SHOW

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:33.584
ONE SIDE EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE OF

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:35.219
THE LANGUAGE HAS BEEN MORE SO ON

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:37.021
ONE SIDE.

00:42:37.087 --> 00:42:39.156
THAT SAID HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:41.225
THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOR SYSTEM

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:43.794
LEADERS TO BE ABLE TO INFUSE

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:45.262
THAT SECOND SIDE OF THE COIN.

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:46.830
WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN THE

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.766
PACKET IS IN EDUCATION CODE IN

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.901
TITLE FIVE THERE IS A VERY

00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:52.369
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE AROUND

00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:54.371
DIVERSITY THERE'S VERY SPECIFIC

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:56.006
LANGUAGE AROUND PROMOTION OF

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:57.274
INCLUSION?

00:42:57.341 --> 00:42:59.944
THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE IN LAW

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.579
ACTUALLY ALLOWS US TO SHOW THAT

00:43:02.646 --> 00:43:05.149
OTHER SIDE OF THE SAME COIN AND

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:06.750
SO I ENCOURAGE YOU AS YOU LOOK.

00:43:06.817 --> 00:43:09.153
INTO HOW WE CAN HELP OUR ALL OUR

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:12.389
SYSTEMS AT IN THIS ARENA THAT IS

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:13.257
ONE THING YOU CAN DO IS

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:15.526
EMPHASIZE THAT OTHER SIDE THAT

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:17.428
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.395
WHEN I WAS AT THE STATE

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:20.264
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I ALSO PUT

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:22.633
FORTH A LEGAL MEMO OF SPELLING

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.301
OUT THE LEGAL PARAMETERS POP

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.103
TOOL NINE AND OTHER THE OTHER

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:28.172
SIDE OF THE SAME COIN?

00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:30.040
AND I ALSO TALKED ABOUT FREE

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:32.009
HIRING PROCESS SEES DURING

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:33.610
HIRING PROCESS HE'S AND PULLS

00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:34.945
HIRING PROCESS THESE THOSE THREE

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:36.313
HAVE TO BE THOUGHT OF VERY

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.482
CLEARLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:39.616
FACULTY DIVERSE STATE. ONE OF

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:42.052
THE THINGS I ALSO TALKED ABOUT

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.354
IN THE LEGAL OPINION IS AROUND

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.222
HOW TO ANALYZE DATA.

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.523
HOW DO YOU ANALYZE

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.891
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:50.394
DESPERATE IMPACT ETCETERA?

00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:55.366
AND SO AS YOU WILL SEE IN --

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:57.167
SLIDE.

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:58.335
FIFTEEN I LAID OUT A CHART.

00:43:58.402 --> 00:43:59.636
OF AND I TALKED ABOUT THE 80%

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:01.605
RULE IN ANALYZING --

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:03.007
AND THE FOUR FIFTHS RULE IN

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:04.575
ANALYZING DISPROPORTIONATE

00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:06.543
IMPACT I ALSO TALK ABOUT

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.545
EXCLUSIONARY AFFECT EXCLUSIONARY

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:09.713
AFFECT IS ESSENTIALLY THE

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:10.547
CONCEPT.

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:12.783
OF SOMETHING THAT IS PUT FORTH

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.219
AS A PROCESS A PRACTICE A RULE

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:17.187
THAT ON ITS FACE IS NOT RACIALLY

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:19.223
DISCRIMINATORY BUT HAS AN

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:20.991
EXCLUSIONARY.

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:22.259
OF RACE DISCRIMINATION A ONE

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:25.529
EXAM.

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:26.930
IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORLD

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:28.732
IS THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATION TO

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:31.835
BE A FACULTY IS A MASTERS DEGREE

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:33.303
YET MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:35.339
A PEACH DE L. REQUIREMENT

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:35.873
INSTEAD.

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:38.375
AND CONSIDERING THE CHALLENGES

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.177
ARE YOU SEE COLLEAGUES ARE

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:41.412
HAVING AROUND.

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:43.881
PHD CANDIDATES OF COLOR WHAT IS

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:45.916
THE LIKELIHOOD THEN OF HAVING

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:46.683
CANDIDATES OF COLOR.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.152
APPLYING TO THE COMMUNITY

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:50.854
COLLEGES SO WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN

00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:54.091
EFFORT TO INCREASE THE RIGOR AND

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:56.627
YOU KNOW OF OF OF GRAVITAS OF

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:59.029
OUR FACULTY MEMBERS WITH THE PHD.

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:00.731
IT ACTUALLY HAS AN EXCLUSIONARY

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:03.233
AFFECT FOR FOLKS OF COLOR

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.068
MISSILE THINGS LIKE THAT ARE

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:05.469
REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN ONE

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:07.471
ANALYZES THE DATA AND I'M VERY

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.173
GLAD ARE YOU SEE SYSTEM --

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:10.874
I SAW ALL THE INFORMATION FROM

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:12.843

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.378

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.952
RICH DATA IT'S TIME FOR US TO

NOW GIVE SOME NUMERICAL

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:25.589
UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE STATUS

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:26.723
AND DO SOME REGULAR ANALYSIS

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.258
WHICH I'M SURE THEY'RE DOING BUT

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:29.760
I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:31.195

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.781
LEADERS AND FACULTY ARE NOT

00:46:57.848 --> 00:46:59.783
REFLECTIVE OF THE DIVERSITY OF

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.351
OUR STUDENTS EVEN WHILE WE KNOW

00:47:01.418 --> 00:47:02.853
THAT THESE LEADERS ARE KEY TO

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.821
PRODUCING MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES

00:47:04.888 --> 00:47:07.424
IN CLOSING RACIAL EQUITY GAPS.

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:09.293
ONE ONLY NEEDS TO SET FOOT ON

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:10.394
ONE OF OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.396
UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES TO SEE THAT

LIKE MANY WE INTERVIEWED IT HAD

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.277
AN IMPACT IN MY INITIAL COLLEGE

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:28.979

BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LANDSCAPE --

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:53.904
WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:56.573
POPULATION TO BE THE MOST

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.308
DIVERSE IN THE WORLD A TREND

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.777
THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE AS 76%

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:02.946
OF K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:04.681

THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:09.253
REFLECT THE CHANGING

00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:10.687
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE.

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:12.122
NEARLY THREE A FOR YOU SEE

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:15.225

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.229
STUDENTS AT THE UC ARE 39% ASIAN

ISLANDER WHICH I WILL BE

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.168
REFERRING TO AS ON P. FOR THE

00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:34.845
YET DESPITE THE RICH DIVERSITY

00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.179
OF OUR STUDENT BODY WITH A TRUE

00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:37.414
LACK OF DIVERSITY IN BOTH

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:39.816
TENURED AND NON TENURED FACULTY

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:41.618
POSITIONS AT THE UC.

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:43.587

70% WHITE 16% ON P. 7% LOT NECKS

AND 2% AFRICAN AMERICAN.

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:03.173
RECOGNIZING IT THIS MISMATCHING

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:03.774
REPRESENTATION WE KNOW THAT

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.208
UNLESS INSTITUTIONS ARE

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:07.644
INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHO THEY HIRE

00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:09.179
SIMPLY HIRING MORE FACULTY IN

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:11.081
FULL TIME POSITIONS DOES NOT

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:12.549
NECESSARILY MAKE THEM MORE

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:14.017
DIVERSE.

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:16.119
BECAUSE HIRING OFTEN OCCURS

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.921
THROUGH EXISTING NETWORKS IT OFF

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.456
IT TENDS TO REPLICATE RATHER

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:20.957
THAN DISRUPT DEMOGRAPHIC

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:23.460
PATTERNS. TO BE CLEAR IF

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:25.162
PROFESSORS ARE ONLY REACHING OUT

00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:26.596
TO OTHER ACADEMICS THROUGH

00:49:26.663 --> 00:49:27.964
TRADITIONAL RECRUITMENT ROUTES

00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:29.666
AND NOT FOCUSED ON OTHER

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:33.804
TALENTS.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.272
WE WILL NOT DIVERSIFY OUR

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:37.040
FACULTY APPLICANT POOL WE WILL

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:38.842
NOT HIRE MORE DIVERSE FACULTY

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:40.544
AND WE WILL NOT DISTRACT

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.079
INEQUITIES.

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:44.081
AS CONCERNING AS THE STATISTICS

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.849
MAYBE THAT DIVERSITY CHALLENGE

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.217
AT THE YOU SEE IS ALSO ONE OF

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:48.151
GENDER.

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.519

FACULTY POSITIONS THAT YOU SEE

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.728
ARE HEAVILY SKEWED TOWARDS MEN

00:49:57.794 --> 00:50:00.964
WOMEN ONLY HOLD 33% OF TENURED

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:02.366
POSITIONS ACROSS THE SYSTEM.

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:03.734
THERE IS SOMEWHAT BETTER GENDER

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:20.183
ITSELF.

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.685
THIS IS CONCERNING GIVEN THE

ROLE ACADEMIC SENATE'S PLAN

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.554
ESTABLISHING POLICIES WHICH CAN

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:27.057
DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THE ABILITY

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:29.192
FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR TO ACCESS

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:30.927

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.763
EXAMPLE OF ACADEMIC DECISION

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:42.272
THE ACADEMIC SENATE.

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:43.507

APPROVED BY THE ACADEMIC SENATE.

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:50.447
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE IN

00:50:50.514 --> 00:50:51.915
POSITIONS TO INFLUENCE ECONOMIC

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.884
POLICY SO SIGNIFICANTLY CAN

UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCES OF

00:50:55.585 --> 00:50:57.187
THE STUDENTS IMPACTED YET WE

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:58.655
FIND THAT BOTH THE CAMPUS AND

00:50:58.722 --> 00:50:59.990
SYSTEM LEVELS OF ACADEMICS

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.792
SENATE'S. EIGHT OUT OF TEN

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:03.660

THREE OF TODAY'S YOU SEE

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:08.098

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:08.632
ACADEMIC SENATE'S FOR UC

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:12.769

LATIN ACTS 3% AFRICAN AMERICAN.

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:16.606
AND THE ACADEMIC CENTER FOR THE

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:19.409
UNIVERSITY A LARGE THE MIRRORS

00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:21.011
THE SAME DATA.

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:22.479
AS YOU NOTED IN THE MAY HEARING

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:24.247
OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE

ON THE MASTER PLAN SHERMAN T.

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:26.650
NOW WE HAVE LONG LAMENTED THESE

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.785
CHALLENGES AT THE UNIVERSITY.

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:30.420
WE HOPE THAT TODAY PROVIDES AN

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:31.922
OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY BRING

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:34.191
FURTHER ATTENTION ON THE NEED TO

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:35.659
MAKE FACULTY AN ACADEMIC SENATE

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:37.194
POSITIONS MORE INCLUSIVE BUT

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.329
ALSO IDENTIFY PRACTICAL NEXT

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:40.797
STEPS TOWARDS THAT END.

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:42.799
IN THAT LIGHT WE'D LIKE TO OFFER

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.634
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:46.203
FIRST WE MUST ADDRESS THE FRONT

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:46.970
END OF THE ISSUE BY

00:51:47.037 --> 00:51:48.872
UNDERSTANDING THE DEMOGRAPHICS

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.307
OF APPLICANT POOLS FOR FACULTY

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:51.808
POSITIONS.

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:53.243
WE OFTEN HEAR THAT A BARRIER TO

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.878
INCREASING FACULTY DIVERSITY IS

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:56.179
AT THE APPLICANT POOL IS NOT

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:57.147
DIVERSE.

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:58.782
HOWEVER REPORT POINTS OUT THAT

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:00.984
OVER THREE THOUSAND DIVERSE

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:02.619
STUDENTS EARNED DOCTORATE

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:03.787
DEGREES FROM THE CSU AND YOU SEE

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:05.121
COMBINED MEETING THE MINIMUM

00:52:06.556 --> 00:52:08.992
POSITIONS AT UC CAMPUSES.

00:52:09.059 --> 00:52:10.927
GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THE DIVERSE

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.195
STUDENT POPULATIONS ARE

00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:13.530
RECEIVING ADVANCED DEGREES MORE

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:14.764
MUST BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THE

EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:19.769
THE UC.

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:20.904
ADDITIONALLY RECOGNIZING THE

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:21.938
IMMENSE POWER THAT ACADEMIC

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:24.207
SENATES HAVE MEMBERSHIP ROSTER

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:25.675
SHOULD BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND

00:52:25.742 --> 00:52:28.778
UPDATED WITH DEMOGRAPHIC DATA.

00:52:28.845 --> 00:52:30.413
FINALLY WE APPRECIATE THE

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.016
LEGISLATURE'S EFFORT AND TO

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.050
INVEST IN FACULTY DIVERSITY AND

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:35.352
THOSE INVESTMENT SHOULD COME

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:36.786
WITH CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY GOALS

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:38.522
AND METRICS AND EVALUATING

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:39.556
EFFICACY.

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.324
RESOURCES ALONE ARE UNLIKELY TO

00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:42.826
YIELD THE DESIRED OUTCOMES AND

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:45.662
WE MUST SCALE WHAT WE KNOW WORKS.

00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:47.163
WITHOUT QUESTION CALIFORNIA'S

00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:31.608
I I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:35.378
SO I I HEARD AND YOU SHARE THE

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:36.479
DATA.

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:39.816
AND RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE IDEA

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:41.718
THAT A DIVERSE FACULTY --

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:44.554
IS -- GOOD.

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:47.757
AND POSITIVE FOR AT ACHIEVEMENT

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:50.827
ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND ALSO

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:52.262
FOR CAMPUS CLIMATE.

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:54.464
IN IN YOUR OPINION.

00:53:54.531 --> 00:53:57.133
UP DO YOU WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.703
UC SYSTEM SHARES.

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:02.772
IN THOSE BELIEFS TODAY.

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:03.907
IN YOUR OPINION DO YOU DO YOU

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:06.109
FEEL OR THINK THAT YOU SEE

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:07.844
SHARES THAT [inaudible]

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:11.548
IDEA CONCEPT.

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:13.883
WOULD YOU LIKE.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:14.417
I THINK.

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:16.486
I THINK THE LEADERSHIP

00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:17.587
AND THE REGION'S --

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:19.889
AND MANY OF OTHERS INCLUDING FOR

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:20.490
INSTANCE --

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:21.891
MY COLLEAGUES IN THE GENERAL

00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:23.293
COUNSEL'S OFFICE FOR THE UC

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.629
SYSTEM PRESIDENT APOLLO TANO.

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:26.496
AND SOMEBODY OTHER HAVE PROBABLY

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:29.566
HAVE BEEN THE MOST SUDDENLY

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:30.767
AROUND THE ISSUE OF FACULTY

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:32.602
DIVERSITY --

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.337
I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY BELIEVE

00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:35.472
ARM AND IN FACT --

00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:37.140
IT CUTTING EDGE AROUND SOME

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:38.508
MEASURES LIKE MICHAEL A QUESTION

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:40.777
OF RACIAL CONSCIOUSNESS IMPLICIT

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:41.945
BIAS SIX CETERA.

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:43.480
AND SO I ACTUALLY WHEN I DID MY

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:45.448
LEGAL OPINION I LOOKED AT THE

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:47.417
UC'S OF LEGAL OPINION.

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:49.285
ON THE MATTER TO SEE WHAT I

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:51.488
COULD WE A DRAW FROM THAT FOR

00:54:51.554 --> 00:54:52.555
OUR OLD SYSTEM OF FOR THE

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:53.990
COMMITTEE COLLEGES.

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:55.425
I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS QUITE

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:57.627
FRANKLY IS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

00:54:57.694 --> 00:54:59.029
ISSUES OF RACE THERE'S AN

00:54:59.095 --> 00:55:00.363
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF NEED FOR

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:02.332
RACIAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND AN

00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:03.867
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF UNDERSTANDING

00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:05.702
AROUND IMPLICIT BIAS.

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:07.404
AND BIAS COMES OUT IN WAYS THAT

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.673
WE COULD NEVER IMAGINE AND EVEN

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.541
THE MOST OF PROGRESSIVE MINDED

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:13.343
PEOPLE HAVE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.545
BIAS AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:16.913
THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL IS TO

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.648
TRAINING AROUND IMPLICIT BIAS

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:20.717
WHICH THE USE OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:22.018
COMMUNITY COLLEGES DOING.

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:24.354
I UNDERSTAND THE UC SYSTEM IS

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:26.890
ALSO IN THAT ARENA TO ALL BUT

00:55:26.956 --> 00:55:28.525
FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THOSE BIAS

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.493
COMES OUT IN MAY BE GUYS WITHIN

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.829
THE CONCEPT OF WEIGHT PROP TWO

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:34.164
OH NINE DOESN'T ALLOW US TO DO

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.466
THAT OR WAIT DIVERSITY HOW DOES

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:37.667
RACIAL DIVERSITY COME INTO PLAY

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:37.834
IN.

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:39.235
THAT COULD BE SEEN AS

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:40.870
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT EXCITER.

00:55:40.937 --> 00:55:44.107
SO HOW THAT COMES OUT IN THIS IS

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:45.375
EXPRESSLY THE CASE OUT OF

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:46.710
COMMITTEE LEVEL WHEN PEOPLE ARE

00:55:46.776 --> 00:55:48.445
SELECTING AT EIGHT MORE

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.013
LOCALIZED LEVEL THE JUST THE

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.881
LEADERSHIP OF THE CAMPUS OR THE

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:52.615
SYSTEM.

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:54.350
SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR ALL

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:56.319
THIS MESSAGING TO REALLY COME

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:58.455
DOWN AND BE A COMPLETELY

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:02.892
CHAMPION BY PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:07.097
LEVEL.

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:07.897
YEAH I MEAN I I THINK I WOULD

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:10.266
JUST ADD THAT WE APPRECIATE AND

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:10.800
ARM.

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:11.668
THE INCREASED ATTENTION AND

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:12.969
FOCUS ON THE BENEFITS OF TO

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:14.571
STUDENT LEARNING RETENTION AND

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:16.406
SUCCESS OF OF FACULTY DIVERSITY

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:17.006
AND WE HOPE THAT OUR SYSTEM

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.775
LEVEL PARTNERS IN THE ACADEMIC

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:19.275
COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND THE

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:20.443
BENEFITS --

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.512
BUT UNTIL WE SEE INVESTMENTS AND

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:24.347
DIVERSIFICATION THE VARYING

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:25.181
BODIES --

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:26.683
THAT NEED TO MEET OF THE

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:30.353
STUDENTS WE SPOTLIGHTING THE

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.456
ISSUE ALONE AND WE ALSO WE NEED --

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:37.660
TO TEXT REMAIN COMMITTED.

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.696
IT YEAH MISTER CHAIR.

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:40.563
IF I MAY ADD THE EFFORT THAT

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:41.698
YOU'RE DOING IN ENSURING THE

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:42.899
LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:43.800
E. L. FUNDING AND JUST LARGELY

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:46.636
THE ISSUE IS REALLY CRITICAL ONE

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:48.638
OF THE TWELVE STUDIES THAT SHOWN

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:51.040
TO HOW IT LIMITED IMPLICIT BIAS.

00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:52.675
IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY AND IT'S A

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:55.044
CHICAGO STUDY OF POLICE OFFICERS

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:56.880
WHEN YOU TELL THEM THAT YOU ARE

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:59.115
LOOKING FOR RACIAL BIAS THE BIAS

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:00.116
GOES AWAY.

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:02.018
AND WHAT WAS CRITICAL IS FOR THE

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.720
STATE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:05.488
KEEP THIS TOPIC.

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:07.423
OF VERY FRONT AND CENTER BECAUSE

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:10.226
BY DOING THAT AND MONITORING AT

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:11.628
THE SYSTEM WILL RESPOND.

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:13.530
AND SO I I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:16.166
TO COMMUTING YOU THAT MONITORING

00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:17.200
LEVEL [inaudible]

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:19.135
THANK YOU --

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:20.537
SRC WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:23.072
MAKE UP OF THE IS --

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:24.541
THE FACULTY SENATE.

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:26.276
COULD YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT

00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:28.678
MORE BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:31.781
WHY IF IF THE FACULTY IS --

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:33.583
THIS COMPOSITION.

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.418
YOU YOU YOU MAKE REFERENCE TO

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:37.020
THE FACT THAT THE FACULTY SENATE

00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:38.788
IS EVEN LESS DIVERSE.

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:40.623
THAN THE FACULTY AND GENERAL

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.926
WHITE WHY IS THAT THE CASE.

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:44.861
WELL I THINK YOU KNOW THE

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:48.231
ACADEMIC SENATE IS A VOLUNTARY

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:50.600
FOR AT THAT TIME FACULTY NITA

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:52.235
ELECTED TO SERVE ON AND I THINK

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:54.938
A LOT OF TIMES IN THE IN THE

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:55.939
RESEARCH WE'VE DONE IN

00:57:56.005 --> 00:57:57.373
CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.475
ACADEMIC SAID A LOT OF TIMES.

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:01.544
THEY'RE NOT BEING OUT REACHED

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:02.712
TWO ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.781
SERVING ON THE ACADEMIC SENATE

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:07.250
NECESSARILY OR THEY DON'T I'M.

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:09.185
THERE OFTEN TIED UP KIND OF

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:14.624
DOING A LOT EFFORTS SO OR TRYING

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:16.226
TO HELP OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR IN

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:17.160
OTHER OF VARIOUS WAYS AND FEEL

00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:18.394
LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.296
TIME COMMITMENT TO SERVE ON THE

00:58:20.363 --> 00:58:22.565
ACADEMIC SENATE AND SO I THINK

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:24.467
MORE RESEARCH ARE MARKED.

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.936
OUT REACHES NEEDED --

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:28.771
TO OUR FACULTY TO ENSURE THAT

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:30.440
THEY UNDERSTAND --

00:58:30.506 --> 00:58:31.875
THESE POSITIONS ARE OPEN TO THEM

00:58:31.941 --> 00:58:33.643
AND THAT THEY SHOULD THAT THEIR

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:34.911
COURAGE.

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:37.580
TO SERVE ON THOSE BODIES SO FOR

00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:39.816
EXAMPLE.

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:41.784
IN YOU SEE NOT ALL TENURED

00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:42.719
FACULTY BELONG TO THE ACADEMICS

00:58:42.785 --> 00:58:46.189
AND I'M A YOU KNOW IT VARIES

00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:46.923
ACROSS --

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.158
THE SYSTEM CAMPUS IN TERM OF

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:52.128
WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:54.998
I'M SERVING ON ACADEMICS AND

00:58:55.064 --> 00:59:00.136
IT'S BUT WHAT WE CAN HEAR MORE

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:02.739
YEAH WE CAN HEAR MORE FROM THE

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:03.373
ACADEMIC SAID IT BUT IT DID.

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:06.409
I'M WE ACTUALLY HAVE A WHOLE --

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:08.211
ANALYSIS IN OUR REPORT THAT KIND

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:10.546
OF OUTLINES THE DIFFERENT --

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:11.848
RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:13.182
ACADEMIC SENATE'S BY SYSTEM IN

00:59:13.249 --> 00:59:14.517
CAMPUS BECAUSE IT DOES.

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:19.422
VERY FOR N. --

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:20.823
IF YOU WOULD LITERACY CAN YOU

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.159
SAY MORE ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT.

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:25.929
THE DIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT --

00:59:25.995 --> 00:59:27.597
THAT THIS STUDY YOUR STUDY I

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:28.798
SURE DID BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:29.999
TALKING ABOUT FACULTY BUT WE'RE

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:31.668
ALSO INTERESTED.

00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:32.635
IN --

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:35.638
ADMINISTRATORS AS WELL AS I

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:37.540
MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS ARE

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:39.175
REPORT WAS UNIQUE IN THAT IT

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:41.945
ANALYZE CAMPUS DIVERSITY BEYOND

00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:44.080
JUST FACULTY IT LOOKED AT SENIOR

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:46.849
LEADERSHIP ON CAMPUS AS WELL AS

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:49.052
SYSTEM LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNING

00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:51.287
BOARD DIVERSITY --

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:52.255
SO THE REPORT FINDS THAT THERE

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:54.123
DIVERSITY CHALLENGES AT THOSE

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:56.025
LEVELS FOR THE UC --

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.694
TO FOR SENIOR LEADERSHIP AT UC

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.430
CAMPUSES WHICH IS --

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:01.898
FOR INSTANCE CHANCELLOR'S VICE

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.733
CHANCELLORS AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.503
CHANCELLOR'S CABINET I'M 70% ARE

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:09.839
WHITE AND NEARLY TWO OUT OF FIVE

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.908
YOU SEE STUDENTS ARE ON P. YET

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.009
FEWER THAN.

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:17.647
ONE IN TEN CAMPUS LEADERS ARE ON

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:20.149
WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE UC BOARD

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:21.250
OF REGENTS THE APPOINTMENT SO

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.585
I'M AT THE APPOINTED MEMBERS OF

THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.154
AND WE FIND THAT THERE SIXTY

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:28.725
PURCHASE 62% ARE WHITE 23% LOT

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:33.496
NEXT 8% AFRICAN AMERICAN AND 8%

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:37.567
ON P..

01:00:37.633 --> 01:00:39.635
A AND WE'RE GONNA ADD SOMETHING

01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:41.838
I THINK.

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:04.352
FUNDING HAS TRULY LEVERAGED

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:05.854
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AT THE

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.023
CAMPUS LEVEL IN ALL THREE YEARS

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:09.591
WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT CAMPUS

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.893
INVESTMENT IN THESE PROGRAMS.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.162
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT REQUIRED.

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:15.463
THE STRUCTURE OF THIS PROGRAM

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.465
HAS CREATED A SENSE OF URGENCY

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:19.434
THROUGH ITS MANDATE THAT EFFORTS

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:21.536
TAKE PLACE IN A SINGLE ACADEMIC

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.471
RECRUITMENT CYCLE AND PRESS TO

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:25.540
RECRUITMENT ALMOST ALL START IN

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.876
THE FALL AND CONCLUDE BY JULY

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.577
WHEN OUR NEW FACULTY.

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:31.546
JOIN US --

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.281
SO IT WAS A PUSH TO TO TO TO

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:34.849
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HIRING IN

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:36.251
THE COURSE OF THAT SINGLE YEAR

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:37.519
BUT THIS PROGRAM HAS BROUGHT

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:39.054
POWERFUL NEW ACCOUNTABILITY

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.289
pADVISORY GROUP THAT TRACKS

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.325
PROGRESS OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:45.126
ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:46.294
BOTH OF THESE COMPONENTS ARE A

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:47.996
NEW FACTORY IN OUR WORK AT THE

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:49.397
UNIVERSITY.

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.999
WE ALSO HAVE SEEN THAT THE

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:52.267
SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:53.568
DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:56.404
CERTAIN COMMON PRACTICES STRONG

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:58.840
LEADERSHIP FROM CHAIRS DEANS AND

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.408
PROVOSTS.

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:02.110
DELIBERATE EFFORTS TO CHANGE

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:04.512
EVALUATION PRACTICES AND

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:07.449
CAREFULLY PLANNED OUR EACH.

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:08.616
AND THEN JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.085
THE CURRENT YEAR HERE THREE OF

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:11.219
THIS FUNDING.

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:12.654
WE'VE CONTINUED THE FOCUS ON

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.189
RECRUITMENT AND THIS YEAR HAVE

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:16.458
MADE FOR A NEW PILOT PROGRAM

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:17.125
AWARDS.

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:17.926
ALL DRAW FROM THE SUCCESSFUL

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:21.830
INTERVIEW HERE'S ONE AND TWO

01:23:21.896 --> 01:23:23.531
ALSO AT THE REQUEST OF CAMPUS

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:25.100
LEADERSHIP WE'VE CONDUCTED A

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:26.701
SECOND REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:29.003
WITH A FOCUS NOT ON RECRUITMENT.

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.305
BUT ON BUILDING AND TESTING

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:32.273
PRACTICES THAT WILL ENSURE WE

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.576
RETAIN OUR DIVERSE FACULTY AND

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:36.644
PROVIDE AN INCLUSIVE ACADEMIC

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.246
CLIMATE FOR ALL.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:39.714
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH QUALITY OF

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.416
THE PROPOSAL'S PRESIDENT OF

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:43.251
POLITECNICO OF FUNDS SIX OF

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:45.153
THESE RETENTION PROJECTS.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.721
WE WOULD NOT BE AT THIS POINT

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:48.123
WITHOUT THE STATE FUNDING AND

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.224
YOUR INSISTENCE ON

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:51.226
ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH MEANS

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.761
SUCH AS THIS.

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:54.796
HERE FEW DETAILS OF WHAT'S NEW

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.398
AND EXCITING IN YEAR.

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:58.066
THREE THE LIFE SCIENCES AT UC

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.401
BERKELEY ARE REFINING

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:01.703
RECRUITMENT PRACTICES THAT WERE

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:04.372
IMMENSELY SUCCESSFUL IN BERKELEY

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:06.040
ENGINEERING DURING YOUR TO R.

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:07.609
SAID IS FULLY INTEGRATING THE

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:09.844
STUDENTS NEEDS AS THEY PLAN

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.246
THEIR PILOT.

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:12.147
AND WHAT'S NEW FACTLY ON OUR ON

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:13.715
CAMPUS NEXT FALL DAY WILL BE

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.650
MATCHED WITH EXPERT TEACHING

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:17.218
MENTORS.

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:18.686
THE DISCIPLINE OF MATHEMATICS

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:19.788
HAS SOME OF THE LOWEST

01:24:19.854 --> 01:24:21.122
REPRESENTATION OF UNDER

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:23.224
REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.659
FEMALE FACULTY.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.561
UC RIVERSIDE HAS DESIGNED A BOLD

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.563
PILOT TO PIONEER NEW PRACTICES

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:31.065
IN MATH.

01:24:31.132 --> 01:24:32.567
AND TO ENSURE WE RETAIN THE

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:33.835
DIVERSE FACULTY OF IT THAT WE

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.304
ALREADY HAVE WE'RE FOCUSING ON

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:38.606
PROGRAMS IN THE ARTS HUMANITIES

01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:40.108
AND OTHER DISCIPLINES WITH THE

01:24:40.175 --> 01:24:43.044
HIGHEST CURRENT REPRESENTATION

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:45.180
OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES.

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:46.281
WE'RE ALSO TESTING SOME

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:47.882
SUCCESSFUL WAYS TO UNDERSTAND

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.317
AND IMPROVE CLIMATE ISSUES AT

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:51.553
THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL.

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:53.054
AND FINALLY SEVERAL THIS YEAR'S

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:54.956
PILOTS ARE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:56.658
OF SERVICE WORK AND IT'S

01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:58.426
DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVE

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:01.095
IMPACT ON WOMEN AND

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:02.997
UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES.

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:04.432
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TIME OR

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:06.234
MONEY TO WASTE E NEED TO MOVE

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:08.369
NOW TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY TO

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.338
TEST MORE INTERVENTIONS AND TO

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:11.906
DEVELOP AND ANALYZE DATA THAT

01:25:11.973 --> 01:25:13.575
TELLS US WHERE THE PILOT

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:15.109
INTERVENTIONS ARE WORKING.

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:17.946
AND FRANKLY WHERE THEY'RE NOT.

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:20.181
YOU SEE HAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:22.484
DEAN LED ACADEMIC UNITS AND WE

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.953
HAVE DIRECTLY TOUCHED ONLY A FEW

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:25.820
IT WITH THESE THREE YEARS OF

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:28.356
FUNDING WE WOULD LIKE TO COMMIT.

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:29.057
I WOULD LIKE TO BUILD

01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:31.259
COMMITMENTS TO FACULTY DIVERSITY

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:33.294
IN ALL OF OUR UNITS SO THAT WE

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:34.395
CAN TRULY TALK ABOUT

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:37.632
INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION.

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:39.534
FACULTY INVOLVED TO DATE HAVE

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:41.703
BEEN MOST RESPONSIVE AND THEY

01:25:41.769 --> 01:25:43.304
APPRECIATE THE EVIDENCE BASED

01:25:43.371 --> 01:25:44.806
TOOLS AND PRACTICES WE'RE

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:46.307
EXPERIMENTING WITH.

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:47.876
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.544
THESE PARTNERSHIPS.

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:50.578
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO CONTINUE

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.447
MAKING MORE SUSTAIN PROGRESS AND

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:53.548
DISCIPLINES WHERE WOMEN AND

01:25:53.615 --> 01:25:55.683
UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES ARE

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:57.118
STILL IN SMALL NUMBERS.

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:59.320
SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:01.389
MATHEMATICS ECONOMICS MANAGEMENT.

01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:03.291
AND OTHERS.

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:04.893
BUT WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE WORK

01:26:04.959 --> 01:26:06.761
OF THOSE FACULTY IN DISCIPLINES

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.530
WHOSE RESEARCH AND TEACHING DEAL

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:11.432
WITH ISSUES OF EQUITY IN ACCESS.

EXPRESSION.

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:27.549
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND OUR

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:28.182

FACULTY.

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:03.964
THE DEPARTMENTS ARE SO NARROW.

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:05.499
IN WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING.

01:40:05.566 --> 01:40:09.002
FOR OR THAT THEY PERPETUATE.

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:10.804
THE PRACTICE OF WHAT THEY ARE

01:40:18.545 --> 01:40:22.015
PHD EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF

01:40:22.082 --> 01:40:23.617
WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING.

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:26.754

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:52.766
THING BECAUSE SOME OF THESE.

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:56.203
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS.

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:58.572
IS KIND OF THE CHICKEN THAT WHAT

01:42:58.639 --> 01:42:59.873
COMES FIRST YOU LOOK AT THE

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:00.841
NUMBER OF THAT. FOR EXAMPLE

01:43:00.908 --> 01:43:02.042
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:03.577

ARE UCL'S WILL GO ON THE UC IT'S

01:43:06.446 --> 01:43:09.116
A IT'S A NUMBER THAT'S VERY VERY

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:09.316
LONG.

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:12.886
EMBARRASSING IS.

01:43:12.953 --> 01:43:13.520
LESS WAY LESSENED BY PRESENTING

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:17.524
IS THREE PER EXAMPLE THAT CO

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:19.526
WORKER EVEN THAT TINO --

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:21.228
ACT ECONOMICS PHD IS NOT THAT

01:43:21.295 --> 01:43:21.828
GREAT SO THEY'RE PROBABLY IN

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:23.363
HIGH DEMAND.

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:25.666

I ASSUME THAT WE HAVE THE SAME

01:43:34.274 --> 01:43:37.377
CHALLENGES WE'RE WE'RE GOING

01:43:37.444 --> 01:43:38.445

INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN CHECK IN AND

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.649
CHIU SO IF WE DO --

01:43:42.716 --> 01:43:43.984
LET'S SAY WIN THE PRIZE AND AND

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:45.752

SOMETHING AND KEEPING THEM IT IS

01:43:54.494 --> 01:43:55.629
THAT'S ISSUE TO IS NOT JUST.

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:58.065
RECRUITMENT RETENTION SO.

01:43:58.131 --> 01:43:59.099
HOW DOES HOW DOES THAT HOW'S

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:00.801
THAT PLAYING OUT WOULD WHEN WE

HAVE BEEN MAKING A DIFFERENCE

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:04.304

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:09.977
WE DO HAVE --

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:11.511
A CHALLENGE IN RETENTION BOTH

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:15.015
BECAUSE AS YOU SAID --

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:16.550
THE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:17.851
HAVE OTHER OPTIONS.

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:18.719
AND BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY'RE IN

01:44:18.785 --> 01:44:21.655
ENVIRONMENTS DON'T FEEL THEY CAN

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:22.923
DO THEIR BEST WORK AND THEY

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:24.291
LEAVE BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:44:24.358 --> 01:44:27.427
SO WE HAVE STARTED A SYSTEM WIDE --

01:44:27.494 --> 01:44:29.529

INTO PILOTS --

01:44:52.919 --> 01:44:54.388
ON RETENTION.

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:56.123
AND RECRUITMENT IS ONLY HALF THE

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:58.358
STORY -- AND

01:44:58.425 --> 01:44:59.893

LITEON X. FACULTY AND

01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:13.860
INTERNATIONAL BECAUSE WE THOUGHT

01:52:13.927 --> 01:52:16.129

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:17.530
IF WE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE LET ME

01:52:17.597 --> 01:52:19.532
ASK THE QUESTION WHAT WHAT WHY

01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:21.701

BEING FLETCHER A TO BE HONEST

01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:32.312
WITH YOU I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I

01:52:32.378 --> 01:52:33.913
SAW THAT --

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:34.948
TO MAYBE MAYBE SAYS GOOD SPEAK

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:36.116
MORE TO IT BECAUSE I HAVE NOT

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:38.985
STUDIED THE WIVES OF THAT I KNOW

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:41.254
WITH CERTAIN STEM AREAS --

01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:42.589
AWARE OF MOST OF THE CAMPUS HAS

01:52:42.655 --> 01:52:44.324
BEEN GROWING MORE RAPIDLY I

01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:45.859
COULD SEE WHY THAT MIGHT HAVE

01:52:45.925 --> 01:52:47.427
HAPPENED SUSAN DO YOU KNOW MORE.

01:52:47.494 --> 01:52:49.195
WE DO IT IT'S AN INDICATION THAT

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:54.501
WE WE RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY --

01:52:54.567 --> 01:52:56.970
AND THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE BE

01:52:57.036 --> 01:52:59.105
SURE WE WE HAVE A SENSE OF THE

01:52:59.172 --> 01:53:00.106
FULL.

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:02.308
UP POOL OF APPLICANTS --

01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:04.043
I THINK THE PERCENTAGE WENT UP

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:06.746
OVER THAT TIME ABOUT 4% BUT THAT

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:08.548
WAS A LARGER PERCENT THEN THE IT

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:10.450
THE INCREASE IN THE UNDER

01:53:10.517 --> 01:53:12.018
REPRESENTED MINORITY POPULATION.

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:14.687
SET SO WE AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:16.623
WE WE'RE THAT IS OUT WE'RE NOT

01:53:16.689 --> 01:53:18.324
PUTTING --

RESOURCES INTO THAT --

01:53:22.028 --> 01:53:24.330
I IF I COULD.

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:27.567
THE AD REALLY AND AN ANSWER TO A

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:30.069
PREVIOUS QUESTION YOU ASKED --

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:32.405
I THINK WHEN I MOST ENCOURAGED

01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:34.040
BY THERE'S A LOT TO NOT BE

01:53:34.107 --> 01:53:35.642
ENCOURAGED BY WHICH WE'RE

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:37.443

I AM MOST ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT

01:53:40.013 --> 01:53:42.115
THAT THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE

01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:43.983
BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT FOR THIS

01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:44.250
PROGRAM.

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:48.254
ARE FOCUSED ON HOW WE EVALUATE

CANDIDATES WHEN WE GET HUNDREDS

01:53:50.523 --> 01:53:52.692
OF APPLICANTS WE HAVE TO HAVE A

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:57.263
GOOD WAY THAT'S NOT FULL OF BIAS --

01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:59.132
TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S THE RIGHT

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:00.633
PERSON FOR YOU SEE NOT WHO'S THE

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:02.135

MEMBERS HAVE --

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:12.845
SCENE THAT THEY CAN'T EVALUATE

01:54:12.912 --> 01:54:14.380
AS YOU'VE SUGGESTED WE WILL HAVE

01:54:14.447 --> 01:54:15.682
THE SAME RESULTS WE'VE HAD IN

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:16.649
THE PAST SO THEY ARE

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:17.917
EXPERIMENTING WITH.

01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:19.886
RUBRICS THEY'RE EXPERIMENTING

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:21.221
WITH -- A

01:54:21.287 --> 01:54:22.855
PRIORITIZATION OF CONTRIBUTIONS

CANDIDATES.

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:26.492
AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHEN

THE CURVE. TO CHANGE THE

01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:45.678
REALITIES OF THAT ARE AS AS A

01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:47.814
SOME WOMEN MCCARTY SAID THAT

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:48.615
FORTY TWO YEARS. THREE YEARS

01:54:48.681 --> 01:54:51.017
DOWN THE LINE WE SHOW THAT WE

01:54:51.084 --> 01:54:53.219
ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING HERE.

01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:55.121
OB ARE THAT THAT WE DIDN'T

01:54:55.188 --> 01:54:56.856
THROWN A GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD

01:54:56.923 --> 01:54:59.225
THAT WE ACTUALLY TRIED TO AFFECT

01:54:59.292 --> 01:55:02.395
A NEW AGENDA IN THE NEW REALITY --

01:55:02.462 --> 01:55:03.229
ARE.

01:55:03.296 --> 01:55:07.634
A MORE INCLUSIVE REALITY --

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:11.504
I I I THINK.

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:13.606
FROM MY CHAIR I HAVE NEVER SEEN

01:55:13.673 --> 01:55:15.208
THE THE COMMITMENT SO REAL NOR

01:55:15.275 --> 01:55:16.909
THE POLICIES AND PROCESS THESE

01:55:16.976 --> 01:55:18.578
PUT IN PLACE TO THE DEGREE TO

01:55:18.645 --> 01:55:21.514
WHICH WE HAVE --

01:55:21.581 --> 01:55:25.618
I'D ACT --

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:28.888
I'M HAPPY CAN WE LEARN TO DO

01:55:28.955 --> 01:55:31.124
THIS EVEN BETTER FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:33.893
REALITY DID CHIU JUST A ONE OF

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.762
YOU JUST IDENTIFIED ABOUT.

01:55:35.828 --> 01:55:37.263
OUT AND IT'S A REALITY THAT HAD

01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:38.264
AT THAT AFFLICTS RESEARCH

01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:39.932
UNIVERSITIES WHICH A LOT OF

01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:41.467
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND POSITION UP

01:55:41.534 --> 01:55:43.636
PROGRAMS A POSITION AT THE

01:55:43.703 --> 01:55:45.371
FRONTIERS OF KNOWLEDGE.

01:55:45.438 --> 01:55:46.773
THAT'S WHERE THEIR POSITION

01:55:46.839 --> 01:55:48.341
THEY'RE NOT MAKING GENERAL

01:55:48.408 --> 01:55:49.776
EDUCATION THEY'RE THEY'RE ALSO

01:55:49.842 --> 01:55:51.077
GENERATING NEW KNOWLEDGE AND

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:53.680
THAT'S THAT THAT USUALLY IS A

01:55:53.746 --> 01:55:54.747
COMPLY WITH SOME.

01:55:54.814 --> 01:55:56.649
HYPER DIVERSIFICATION THAT

01:55:56.716 --> 01:56:00.253
HAPPENS AT THOSE FRONT TWO YEARS.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.322
AND SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:56:02.388 --> 01:56:05.158
THEY HIRE NISH SPECIALISTS.

01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:07.260
WHICH WHICH MAKES IT ACTUALLY

01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:08.995
Và HARDER TO GET DIVERSITY.

01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:11.831
BUT WHAT YOU ALSO FIND BECAUSE

01:56:11.898 --> 01:56:13.066

KNOWLEDGE OF CHANGING MORE

01:56:16.436 --> 01:56:17.637
RAPIDLY.

01:56:17.704 --> 01:56:18.905
VERIFY THE ACTUALLY DOES GREATER

01:56:18.971 --> 01:56:21.240
VALUE IN HAVING MORE GENERALISTS.

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:23.009
IN THEIR DEPARTMENTS AND THAT

01:56:23.076 --> 01:56:26.079

AND THE A IN LATE. TWENTY

01:58:22.929 --> 01:58:24.764
FOURTEEN THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:26.299
TWENTY FIFTEEN ACADEMIC YEAR --

01:58:26.365 --> 01:58:28.067
THERE WAS --

01:58:28.134 --> 01:58:30.069
A BIG PUSH ON OUR CAMPUS TO

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:32.305
REALLY TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:35.174
THAT AND I MIGHT POSE IT --

01:58:35.241 --> 01:58:37.944
A RESPONSE TO ONE OF YOUR

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:39.412
EARLIER ABOUT WHY WE MOVE SO

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:42.281
SLOWLY I THINK SOMETIMES WE MODE

01:58:42.348 --> 01:58:45.117
MOVE SLOWLY AND ACADEMIA BECAUSE

01:58:45.184 --> 01:58:46.319
WERE USED TO ALSO CAN QUIT.

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:48.488
VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.

01:58:48.554 --> 01:58:49.856
AND THEN ON THE BASIS OF THE

01:58:49.922 --> 01:58:51.457
RESULTS OF THAT THEN ASKING THE

01:58:51.524 --> 01:58:53.793
NEXT SPECIFIC QUESTION AND I'M A

01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:55.228
SCIENTIST AND THAT'S THE WAY

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:56.963
SCIENCE WORKS.

01:58:57.029 --> 01:58:58.164
HOWEVER --

01:58:58.231 --> 01:59:00.099
CERTAINLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

01:59:00.166 --> 01:59:02.101
WHEN I TOOK ON THIS POSITION

01:59:02.168 --> 01:59:04.103
WHICH WAS EXACTLY DURING THAT

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:05.838
PERIOD OF TIME I THOUGHT I DON'T

01:59:05.905 --> 01:59:07.173
WANT TO DO.

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:07.974
A WHOLE BUNCH A LITTLE

01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:09.876
EXPERIMENT SO WHAT I WANT US TO

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:12.645
DO IS OUR VERY BEST WITH ALL OF

01:59:12.712 --> 01:59:14.747
OUR BEST IDEAS AND SEE IF WE CAN

01:59:14.814 --> 01:59:16.015
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:18.117
SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:19.552
THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE'VE MADE.

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:21.220
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE DID DO

01:59:21.287 --> 01:59:22.788
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY

01:59:22.855 --> 01:59:24.690
WHICH ONE OF THOSE ACTUALLY

01:59:24.757 --> 01:59:26.292
BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE AND MAYBE

01:59:26.359 --> 01:59:27.894
IT WAS A GOOD COMBINATION OF ALL

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:28.961
OF THEM.

01:59:29.028 --> 01:59:31.397
SO IT'S NOT A GOOD EXPERIMENT IS

01:59:31.464 --> 01:59:33.633
VERY POOR SCIENCE BUT NEVER THE

01:59:33.699 --> 01:59:35.701
LESS I THINK WE'VE ACHIEVED WHAT

01:59:35.768 --> 01:59:37.169
WE WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

01:59:37.236 --> 01:59:39.038
SO INYO PACKETS YOU HAVE A HAND

01:59:39.105 --> 01:59:41.340
OUT THAT --

01:59:41.407 --> 01:59:42.775
INCLUDES.

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:45.311
A GRAPH HERE ON THE FIRST PAGE.

01:59:45.378 --> 01:59:49.482
AND WE INSTITUTED THE A NUMBER

01:59:49.549 --> 01:59:53.319
OF INITIATIVES WHERE THE RED

01:59:53.386 --> 01:59:56.789
ARROW IS WHICH IS BETWEEN THE

01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:58.291
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND FIFTEEN

01:59:58.357 --> 02:00:00.192
SIXTEEN ACADEMIC YEAH.

02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:03.429
AND BEFORE WE GET INTO.

02:00:03.496 --> 02:00:04.597
WHAT IT IS --

02:00:04.664 --> 02:00:06.165
THAT WE ACTUALLY DID I THOUGHT

02:00:06.232 --> 02:00:07.767
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK AT THE

02:00:07.833 --> 02:00:10.803
THE RESULTS [inaudible]

02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:12.705
BEFORE --

02:00:12.772 --> 02:00:14.340
THESE INTERVENTIONS IN THE THREE

02:00:14.407 --> 02:00:16.676
YEARS BEFORE THESE INTERVENTIONS

02:00:16.742 --> 02:00:18.844
THE INCOMING FACULTY WERE

02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:22.815
BETWEEN SOMETHING LIKE 10213% OF

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:24.183
THE NW RECRUITS.

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:26.419
OFF TO THESE INTERVENTIONS WE

02:00:26.485 --> 02:00:29.689
WENT UP TO ABOUT 22%.

02:00:29.755 --> 02:00:31.190
THE FIRST YEAR WE THOUGHT WELL

02:00:31.257 --> 02:00:32.792
THIS IS WONDERFUL IS THIS A ONE

02:00:32.858 --> 02:00:34.293
OFF HAVE WE ACTUALLY DONE

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:36.495
SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT HERE.

02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:38.497
AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE MANAGED

02:00:38.564 --> 02:00:40.299
TO REPLICATE THAT IN THE THREE

02:00:40.366 --> 02:00:43.169
YEARS PAAS THE INTERVENTIONS SO

02:00:43.235 --> 02:00:44.837
SO WE'VE ROUGHLY DOUBLED --

02:00:44.904 --> 02:00:46.572
THE NUMBER OF UNDERREPRESENTED

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:49.308
MINORITY FACULTY IN THE INCOMING

02:00:49.375 --> 02:00:52.945
COHORT -- WE

02:00:53.012 --> 02:00:54.013
IN THE FIRST YEAR DIDN'T HAVE

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.715
MUCH DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF AN

02:00:55.781 --> 02:00:59.685
IMPACT ON THAT THE NUMBER OF NEW

02:00:59.752 --> 02:01:01.821
RECRUITS IDENTIFYING AS FEMALE

02:01:01.887 --> 02:01:03.623
BUT AFTER A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:01:03.689 --> 02:01:04.724
EFFORT.

02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:06.325
TO THOSE WENT UP --

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:11.230
NOW FROM ABOUT. 353-637-2407

02:01:11.297 --> 02:01:13.566
PERCENT OF THE INCOMING FACULTY

02:01:13.633 --> 02:01:15.701
AND AGAIN THE FIRST YEAR WE WANT

02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:17.637
SOCIAL THIS WAS REAL BUT NOW

02:01:17.703 --> 02:01:19.639
WE'VE REPLICATED IT FOR A SECOND

02:01:19.705 --> 02:01:21.140
YEAR SO WE THINK.

02:01:21.207 --> 02:01:23.209
THAT WE'VE MADE SOME DIFFERENCES

02:01:23.275 --> 02:01:24.677
IN THAT REGARD.

02:01:24.744 --> 02:01:26.812
NOW WHAT DO WE DO ONE OF THE

02:01:26.879 --> 02:01:28.080
THINGS THAT I THINK IS

02:01:28.147 --> 02:01:30.316
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ON A CAMPUS

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:31.784
IS THAT THERE'S A STRONG

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:33.319
CONSISTENT MESSAGE FROM THE

02:01:33.386 --> 02:01:34.720
LEADERSHIP.

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:37.123
AND THAT INCLUDES.

02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:38.024
SORT OF PUTTING THEIR MONEY

02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:39.625
WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS IN TERMS OF

02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:41.727
LEADERSHIP AND AND I IT THAT'S

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:44.530
WHY I HAVE THIS COMPASS IT.

02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:46.432
SET OF PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE

02:01:46.499 --> 02:01:48.734
LEADERSHIP AT THE UC CAMPUS

02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:51.671
WHICH ARE CLEARLY ILLUSTRATES

02:01:51.737 --> 02:01:54.573
THIS COMMITMENT TO AND THERE ARE --

02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:56.375
40% OF OUR LEADERS WHO IDENTIFY

02:01:56.442 --> 02:01:59.979
AS FEMALE AND ABOUT 25% WHO ARE

02:02:00.046 --> 02:02:01.881
UNDER REPRESENTED --

02:02:01.947 --> 02:02:05.685
TO FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS.

02:02:05.751 --> 02:02:08.120
ALSO EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK ON OUR

02:02:08.187 --> 02:02:10.322
WEBSITE IT TALKS ABOUT --

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:13.225
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY OUR

02:02:13.292 --> 02:02:14.660
INTEREST IN HIRING A DIVERSE

02:02:14.727 --> 02:02:17.096
FACULTY AND SO ON SO IT'S A

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:18.931
CONSISTENT.

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:20.466
PERSISTENT OP MESSAGE FROM THE

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:22.768
TOP.

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:24.403
THE SECOND THING WE DID WAS THAT

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:26.472
IN OUR HIRING ADVERTISEMENTS WE

02:02:26.539 --> 02:02:29.341
PLACE TO VERY DELIBERATE --

02:02:29.408 --> 02:02:31.944
SENTENCES --

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:34.046
ONE IS THAT YOU SEE ARE IS A

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:35.981
WORLD CLASS RESEARCH UNIVERSITY

02:02:36.048 --> 02:02:37.750
WITH AN EXCEPTIONALLY DIVERSE

02:02:37.817 --> 02:02:39.985
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT BODY.

02:02:40.052 --> 02:02:42.588
ITS MISSION IS EXPLICITLY LINKED

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:44.490
TO PROVIDING ROUTES TO

02:02:44.557 --> 02:02:46.325
EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS BALL UNDER

02:02:46.392 --> 02:02:48.360
REPRESENTED IN FIRST GENERATION

02:02:48.427 --> 02:02:50.730
COLLEGE STUDENTS A COMMITMENT TO

02:02:50.796 --> 02:02:52.064
THIS MISSION IS A PREFERRED

02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:54.333
QUALIFICATIONS SO THIS GOES INTO

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:56.068
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR

02:02:56.135 --> 02:02:59.105
ADVERTISEMENTS FOR FACULTY JOBS.

02:02:59.171 --> 02:03:04.610
THE SECOND THING THAT GOES IN IS --

02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:06.345
A PHRASE THAT SAYS ADVANCEMENT

02:03:06.412 --> 02:03:07.913
THROUGH THE FACULTY RANKS AT THE

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:10.216
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS

02:03:10.282 --> 02:03:11.717
THROUGH A SERIES OF STRUCTURED.

02:03:11.784 --> 02:03:13.152
MERIT BASED EVALUATIONS

02:03:13.219 --> 02:03:14.920
OCCURRING EVERY TWO TO THREE

02:03:14.987 --> 02:03:16.989
YEARS EACH OF WHICH HAS

02:03:17.056 --> 02:03:19.959
SUBSTANTIAL PIA INPUT.

02:03:20.025 --> 02:03:21.827
I YOU MIGHT NOT IMMEDIATELY

02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:24.296
IMAGINE WHY WE THOUGHT THIS

02:03:24.363 --> 02:03:25.831
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:28.667
BUT IF YOU.

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:30.936
IF YOU'RE EITHER TRADITIONAL.

02:03:31.003 --> 02:03:32.772
UNIVERSITY AND YOU'VE DESCRIBED

02:03:32.838 --> 02:03:34.140
THEM AS HAVING A LOT OF WHITE

02:03:34.206 --> 02:03:36.108
MALE LEADERSHIP --

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:38.677
THEN THERE'S A TENDENCY AT MANY

02:03:38.744 --> 02:03:40.379
UNIVERSITIES TO GET AHEAD.

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:42.448
BY WHO YOU KNOW WHO YOU PLAY

02:03:42.515 --> 02:03:44.517
GOLF WITH WHO YOU INVITE TO

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:47.720
DINNER AND SO FORTH AND THAT'S

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:50.055
NOT ALWAYS COMFORTABLE FOR WOMEN

02:03:50.122 --> 02:03:52.558
AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY

02:03:52.625 --> 02:03:54.059
FACULTY --

02:03:54.126 --> 02:03:56.195
TO FOR TO PARTICIPATE AND I KNOW

02:03:56.262 --> 02:03:57.730
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T FOR ME I

02:03:57.797 --> 02:03:59.298
DIDN'T LIKE THAT APPROACH TO

02:03:59.365 --> 02:04:00.299
LIFE AT OLE.

02:04:00.366 --> 02:04:03.235
SO I WANTED TO GO TO A PLACE

02:04:03.302 --> 02:04:05.471
JUDGED ON MY OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS

02:04:05.538 --> 02:04:06.772
AND JUDGE FROM MY

02:04:06.839 --> 02:04:08.474
ACCOMPLISHMENTS BY MY PO'S

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:11.277
RATHER THAN OF THE CHAIR.

02:04:11.343 --> 02:04:12.812
OF MY DEPARTMENT RATHER THAN THE

02:04:12.878 --> 02:04:14.380
DEAN I PLAYED GOLF WITH THE

02:04:14.446 --> 02:04:16.448
WHATEVER SO --

02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:19.985
THAT'S WHY WE PUT THAT IN.

02:04:20.052 --> 02:04:20.419
HI --

02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:21.720
THIRDLY WE REQUIRED A

02:04:21.787 --> 02:04:22.988
CONTRIBUTION TO DIVERSITY

02:04:23.055 --> 02:04:24.857
STATEMENT FROM OLD JOB

02:04:24.924 --> 02:04:26.992
CANDIDATES THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL

02:04:27.059 --> 02:04:29.595
STAFF AS WELL AS A FACULTY --

02:04:29.662 --> 02:04:31.330
BUT THIS WAS NEW AT THAT TIME

02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:33.365
FOR THE FACULTY.

02:04:33.432 --> 02:04:35.835
AND IN THAT STATEMENT WE ALSO

02:04:35.901 --> 02:04:37.503
GAP WICCANS TO DESCRIBE THEIR

02:04:37.570 --> 02:04:39.205
PASTA POTENTIAL FUTURE

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:40.840
CONTRIBUTIONS TO PROMOTING A

02:04:40.906 --> 02:04:41.907
DIVERSE.

02:04:41.974 --> 02:04:43.309
EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE

02:04:43.375 --> 02:04:45.244
ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS A KEY

02:04:45.311 --> 02:04:47.413
REQUIREMENT OF THE ROLE OF EVERY

02:04:47.479 --> 02:04:50.049
FACULTY MEMBER AT UC OFF.

02:04:50.115 --> 02:04:51.183
THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS TO

02:04:51.250 --> 02:04:53.185
CONTRIBUTE AND A COMMITMENT TO

02:04:53.252 --> 02:04:55.154
THIS PART OF OUR MISSION CAN BE

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.655
REFLECTED THROUGH RESEARCH

02:04:56.722 --> 02:04:59.925
TEACHING SUPERVISION MENTORING

02:04:59.992 --> 02:05:02.561
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SERVICE AND

02:05:02.628 --> 02:05:03.796
ANY OF THE OTHER VERY THE

02:05:03.863 --> 02:05:05.531
ACTIVITIES THAT A PART OF AN

02:05:05.598 --> 02:05:06.966
ACADEMIC CAREER AND THAT'S I'M

02:05:07.032 --> 02:05:08.968
QUOTING FROM ONE OF OUR WEBSITES

02:05:09.034 --> 02:05:09.668
THAT.

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:11.203
EXPLAINS IT A BIT MORE DETAIL

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:14.807
ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE.

02:05:14.874 --> 02:05:17.309
AND I THINK THAT WHY THAT'S

02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:18.911
IMPORTANT.

02:05:18.978 --> 02:05:19.879
BUT THE DIFFERENCE THAT THAT

02:05:19.945 --> 02:05:21.947
MAKES IT IS THAT IT ONCE AGAIN

02:05:22.014 --> 02:05:24.416
INDICATES OUR COMMITMENT.

02:05:24.483 --> 02:05:26.518
SO TO ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THE

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:28.387
APPLICANTS FOR POSITIONS IT

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:30.756
INDICATES OUR COMMITMENT --

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:32.691
I SUSPECT BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY

02:05:32.758 --> 02:05:34.460
DATA TO SUPPORT THIS THAT IT

02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:36.695
MIGHT DISCOURAGE SOME THAT HAVE

02:05:36.762 --> 02:05:39.265
DIFFERENT GOALS.

02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:41.100
AND THE NUMBER THREE IT GIVES US

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:43.502
A BASIS TO DETERMINE THE FATE TO

02:05:43.569 --> 02:05:46.171
THE MISSION OF UC RIVERSIDE.

02:05:46.238 --> 02:05:48.607
SO HOW WE GOING TO TELL WHETHER

02:05:48.674 --> 02:05:50.042
SOMEONE IS --

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:53.913
COMMITTED TO OUR MISSION.

02:05:53.979 --> 02:05:55.714
THE FULL THING WE DID DOES THAT

02:05:55.781 --> 02:05:57.950
WE REQUIRE FULL SEARCH COMMITTEE

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.551
MEMBERS TO TAKE BOTH AN ONLINE

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:00.519
COURSE GOVERNING THE

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:02.721
EXPECTATIONS AND LEGALITIES OF

02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:04.423
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.

02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:07.927
IN AN ERA WITH PROPOSITION.

02:06:07.993 --> 02:06:09.828
TWO OH NINE AND ALSO AN IN

02:06:09.895 --> 02:06:12.131
PERSON INTERACTIVE ONE AND A

02:06:12.197 --> 02:06:13.365
HALF HOUR WORKSHOP.

02:06:13.432 --> 02:06:15.434
WHERE WE FOCUSED FIRST ON THE

02:06:15.501 --> 02:06:17.369
PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE INITIATIVE

02:06:17.436 --> 02:06:18.938
WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS WHAT ARE

02:06:19.004 --> 02:06:21.373
WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE?

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:22.841
WHAT IT WHAT WE THINK IT'S GOING

02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:25.010
TO DO FOR OUR STUDENTS AND FAR

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:27.947
OFF FACULTY --

02:06:28.013 --> 02:06:29.949
WE ALSO FOCUS ON HOW TO

02:06:30.015 --> 02:06:31.850
RECOGNIZE AND OVERCOME IMPLICIT

02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:33.519
BIAS SEES.

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:36.355
AND WE ALSO FOCUS ON HOW TO

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:38.691
EVALUATE THESE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

02:06:38.757 --> 02:06:40.693
DIVERSE CITY STATEMENTS SO WHAT

02:06:40.759 --> 02:06:41.894
WE DO IS GO THROUGH SOME

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:43.629
EXAMPLES OF SUCH STATEMENTS AND

02:06:43.696 --> 02:06:45.531
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT

02:06:45.597 --> 02:06:46.932
THEM AND THEN WALKED COULD BE

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:48.434
IMPROVED ABOUT THEM SO THAT

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:49.301
PEOPLE HAVE.

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:51.370
SOME IDEA HOW TO EVALUATE THEM

02:06:51.437 --> 02:06:53.172
BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW ASPECT OF

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:54.640
AN APPLICATION.

02:06:54.707 --> 02:06:56.809
AND WE FOUND TO THAT PRIOR TO

02:06:56.875 --> 02:06:58.477
THIS TIME OFF FACULTY WERE

02:06:58.544 --> 02:06:59.712
FLOUNDERING A LITTLE ABOUT

02:06:59.778 --> 02:07:02.648
REALLY WHAT DO I DO WITH IT BUT

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:03.248
IT WAS THERE BUT WHAT DO I DO

02:07:03.315 --> 02:07:03.983
WITH IT.

02:07:04.049 --> 02:07:05.584
AT THE WORKSHOPS WE ALSO

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:07.553
EMPHASIZE THE TREMENDOUS TALENT

02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:08.654
POOL FOUND WITHIN THE

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:09.822
CHANCELLOR'S AND PRESIDENT'S

02:07:09.888 --> 02:07:10.923
POST DOCTORAL.

02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:12.758
FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS YOU'VE HEARD

02:07:12.825 --> 02:07:15.027
ABOUT EARLIER --

02:07:15.094 --> 02:07:16.662
BUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:17.429
THINGS --

02:07:17.496 --> 02:07:19.164
AND USUALLY IT COMES OUT FROM

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:20.966
THE DISCUSSIONS OF IMPLICIT BIAS

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:23.002
SEASON ALSO THE DISCUSSIONS

02:07:23.068 --> 02:07:24.803
ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:26.405
DIVERSE CITY STATEMENTS.

02:07:26.472 --> 02:07:29.174
IS THAT WE HAVE PO'S TALKING TO

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:30.676
PAY IS IN THE ROOM.

02:07:30.743 --> 02:07:32.845
IT IT DOESN'T WORK FOR SOMEONE

02:07:32.911 --> 02:07:34.480
TO STAND AT THE FRONT OF THE

02:07:34.546 --> 02:07:35.280
ROOM AND JUST SPELL OUT.

02:07:35.347 --> 02:07:37.483
WE REALLY ONCE.

02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:39.752
THE FACULTY TO BE TALKING TO ONE

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:42.354
ANOTHER ABOUT VARIOUS ISSUES.

02:07:42.421 --> 02:07:44.957
AND EXACTLY HOW THESE SESSIONS

02:07:45.024 --> 02:07:48.093
GO VARIES TREMENDOUSLY SOMETIMES.

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.595
THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST WONDERFUL

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:51.296
YOU THINK WOW I'M SO GLAD TO BE

02:07:51.363 --> 02:07:52.564
ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THESE

02:07:52.631 --> 02:07:54.900
FACULTY AND THEY EVEN APPLAUD AT

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:56.201
THE END AND SOMETIMES.

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:57.736
SHALL WE SAY WE GO OUT OF THERE

02:07:57.803 --> 02:08:00.773
FEELING AS IF WE'VE BEEN --

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:02.374
ATTACKED FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.

02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:04.076
BUT EVEN IN THE ONES THAT DON'T

02:08:04.143 --> 02:08:06.045
WORK SO WELL AND IT IN SOME WAYS

02:08:06.111 --> 02:08:08.347
IN THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK SO

02:08:08.414 --> 02:08:08.947
WELL.

02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:10.182
DON'T KNOW NOT THEY DON'T WORK

02:08:10.249 --> 02:08:13.318
SO WELL DON'T COME OUT FEELING

02:08:13.385 --> 02:08:14.787
QUITE SO CONFIDENT THAT WITH

02:08:14.853 --> 02:08:16.555
MAKING PROGRESS --

02:08:16.622 --> 02:08:18.257
I THINK WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:21.560
BECAUSE WE'VE STOOD UP THOUGHTS

02:08:21.627 --> 02:08:23.762
AND FACULTY OF HEARD FROM EACH

02:08:23.829 --> 02:08:25.297
OTHER ABOUT THEIR VARIOUS

02:08:25.364 --> 02:08:26.398
EXPERIENCES.

02:08:26.465 --> 02:08:29.701
AND EVEN THE FACULTY WHO.

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:32.337
OF HAVE FULL BY INTO THE MISSION.

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:34.440
BEFORE THEY GO INTO THESE

02:08:34.506 --> 02:08:35.174
WORKSHOPS BECAUSE THAT

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.041
COMPULSORY --

02:08:36.108 --> 02:08:39.745
THEY THEY STILL COME OUT RE

02:08:39.812 --> 02:08:41.313
ENERGIZE BECAUSE THEY REALIZE

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.514
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO

02:08:42.581 --> 02:08:43.615
BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THEY'VE

02:08:43.682 --> 02:08:45.050
HEARD FROM THEIR FELLOW FACULTY

02:08:45.117 --> 02:08:46.151
SO.

02:08:46.218 --> 02:08:47.953
AND BECAUSE THESE A COMPULSORY

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.755
AND WE'VE HAD THREE YEARS WE'VE

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:53.192
NOW HAD 40% OR MORE THAN 40% OF

02:08:53.258 --> 02:08:55.227
THE ENTIRE LADDER RANK FACULTY

02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:56.728
GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

02:08:56.795 --> 02:09:00.532
AND HAVE TO SIT THERE AND LISTEN.

02:09:00.599 --> 02:09:02.901
TO SOME OF US OF IN THIS PROCESS

02:09:02.968 --> 02:09:04.670
SO WE'RE MAKING AN IMPACT ON A

02:09:04.736 --> 02:09:06.638
VERY LARGE PROPORTION AND AS THE

02:09:06.705 --> 02:09:09.741
YEARS GO BY. ONE PRESUMES THAT

02:09:09.808 --> 02:09:11.844
THAT PERCENTAGE WILL GO UP.

02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:14.079
THE FIFTH THING WE DID IS --

02:09:14.146 --> 02:09:16.715
THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED ONE OF

02:09:16.782 --> 02:09:18.884
THE ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSE

02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:20.686
CITY.

02:09:20.752 --> 02:09:22.454
GRANTS THAT --

02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:24.523
SUSAN AND PROGRAMS BROWN --

02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:26.692
SORRY VICE PROVOST COLSON

02:09:26.758 --> 02:09:27.926
IMPROVISE BROWN WERE TALKING

02:09:27.993 --> 02:09:29.394
ABOUT EARLIER.

02:09:29.461 --> 02:09:32.231
AND THIS WAS A PROGRAM IN

02:09:32.297 --> 02:09:34.399
ENGINEERING.

02:09:34.466 --> 02:09:37.903
AND ONE OF THE UNUSUAL POTS OF

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:40.606
THAT PROGRAM WAS THAT WHEN THE

02:09:40.672 --> 02:09:42.207
APPLICATIONS K. MEN.

02:09:42.274 --> 02:09:46.945
THE THE A SEARCH COMMITTEE COULD

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:49.248
ONLY INITIALLY SEE THE

02:09:49.314 --> 02:09:50.849
CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSE CITY

02:09:50.916 --> 02:09:52.885
STATEMENT AND THE RESEARCH

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:54.119
STATEMENT SO THE RESEARCH

02:09:54.186 --> 02:09:55.387
STATEMENT TALKS ABOUT WHAT

02:09:55.454 --> 02:09:57.422
RESEARCH THE CANDIDATE HAD DONE.

02:09:57.489 --> 02:09:59.892
AND PROPOSES TO DO IN THE FUTURE.

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:01.894
SO THOSE WITH THE TWO ELEMENTS

02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:03.996
THAT THEIR SEARCH COMMITTEE

02:10:04.062 --> 02:10:05.831
COULD SEE FIRST AND ONLY IF BOTH

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:07.399
OF THOSE WERE REALLY GOOD.

02:10:07.466 --> 02:10:09.368
DID THE CANDIDATE ADVANCE TO THE

02:10:09.434 --> 02:10:10.802
NEXT STAGE OF REVIEW WHEN THEY

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:13.005
STARTED TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHAT

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:14.139
OF PUBLISHED WHERE DID THEY

02:10:14.206 --> 02:10:15.107
PUBLISH.

02:10:15.174 --> 02:10:16.909
AND SO FORTH.

02:10:16.975 --> 02:10:20.546
AND I THINK THE THE THE DATE AT

02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:22.881
THAT ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THIS

02:10:22.948 --> 02:10:24.816
MADE DIFFERENCE.

02:10:24.883 --> 02:10:26.685
IS THAT IN THE THE FINAL GRAAF

02:10:26.752 --> 02:10:27.252
HERE AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT

02:10:27.319 --> 02:10:29.555
COLORS USED FROM THE PREVIOUS

02:10:29.621 --> 02:10:31.089
GRAPH -- BUT

02:10:31.156 --> 02:10:32.958
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEFT HAND

02:10:33.025 --> 02:10:34.660
SIDE THE A PANEL.

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:36.862
IT GIVES YOU THE DISTRIBUTION OF

02:10:36.929 --> 02:10:39.565
CANDIDATES THAT MAKE IT TO THE

02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:41.200
SHORT LIST.

02:10:41.266 --> 02:10:43.635
NORMALLY IN HIRING DURING THE

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:45.704
HIRING PROCESS IN ENGINEERING

02:10:45.771 --> 02:10:51.710
WHERE. 85% A MALE 99% UNKNOWN

02:10:51.777 --> 02:10:52.544
YOU ARE RAN.

02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:55.013
UP OBVIOUSLY THAN 15% OF FEMALE

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:57.249
AND 1% -- U.

02:10:57.316 --> 02:11:00.219
R. M. -- AND

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:02.154
THEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE SHORT

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:04.523
LIST THAT CAME OUT ALL OF THIS

02:11:04.590 --> 02:11:06.858
PROGRAM WHERE INSTEAD.

02:11:06.925 --> 02:11:09.494
THERE WAS THIS UP FRONT ANALYSIS

02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:10.562
OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:12.364
DIVERSITY STATEMENT TOGETHER

02:11:12.431 --> 02:11:13.599
WITH THE RESEARCH STATEMENT.

02:11:13.665 --> 02:11:15.601
ON THE SHORT LIST WAS A 100%

02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:18.437
FEMALE --

02:11:18.503 --> 02:11:20.572
AND 50% UNDER REPRESENTED

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:23.075
MINORITY AND 50% NON UNDER

02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:24.843
REPRESENTED MINORITY AND FROM

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:27.079
THAT GROUP.

02:11:27.145 --> 02:11:30.482
THE FACULTY WHO WERE HIRED --

02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:32.884
THERE WERE THREE FACULTY MEMBERS

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:34.753
TWO OF WHOM IDENTIFIED AS UNDER

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:37.222
REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND ALL

02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:38.724
THREE WERE FEMALE AND IN

02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:40.792
ENGINEERING OF BEING FEMALE

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:42.694
MANGER ON UNDER REPRESENTED.

02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:43.495
MINORITY [inaudible]

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:46.832
SO.

02:11:46.898 --> 02:11:49.301
WE HAD DATA TO SHOW SOMETHING

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:50.902
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS

02:11:50.969 --> 02:11:54.973
APPROACH SO. THREE FACULTY.

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.174
IN TERMS OF NUMBERS IS NOT

02:11:56.241 --> 02:11:58.310
CONTRIBUTING VERY MUCH TO WHAT

02:11:58.377 --> 02:12:00.812
WE SAW HERE SO THAT THE OTHER

02:12:00.879 --> 02:12:02.748
EFFORTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT.

02:12:02.814 --> 02:12:04.249
FOR WHAT THIS --

02:12:04.316 --> 02:12:06.585
ACTUAL EXPERIMENT THAT WAS DONE

02:12:06.652 --> 02:12:08.387
IN THE MAN OFTEN EXPERIMENT

02:12:08.453 --> 02:12:11.089
ALLOWED US TO DO WAS TO ACTUALLY

02:12:11.156 --> 02:12:13.292
THEN SHOW THE FACULTY AT THESE

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:15.294
WORKSHOPS WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.596
CAN MAKE.

02:12:17.663 --> 02:12:22.768
AB AND I DID ALSO.

02:12:22.834 --> 02:12:25.337
IN THIS PROCESS BY LAW BY.

02:12:25.404 --> 02:12:26.605
DOING THE ANALYSIS ALL OF THE

02:12:26.672 --> 02:12:29.241
APPLICATIONS DIFFERENTLY WE

02:12:29.308 --> 02:12:32.110
MANAGED TO GET FACULTY FURTHER

02:12:32.177 --> 02:12:34.079
AWAY FROM.

02:12:34.146 --> 02:12:36.615
USING WHAT WE WOULD CALL A PROXY

02:12:36.682 --> 02:12:39.785
MET THE PROXY MEASURES ALL OF

02:12:39.851 --> 02:12:41.853
QUALITY.

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:44.022
AND ACADEMIC PEDIGREE.

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:46.925
SO THERE IS A TENDENCY AND YOU

02:12:46.992 --> 02:12:48.694
YOU SORT OF ALLUDED TO THIS IDEA

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.896
THAT OR SOMEONE DID THAT THAT.

02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:52.197
IF.

02:12:52.264 --> 02:12:53.965
YOU YOU LIKE FACULTY WHO LOOK

02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:55.467
LIKE YOU THINK LIKE YOU AND I

02:12:55.534 --> 02:12:56.868
GOING TO DO THE SAME KIND OF

02:12:56.935 --> 02:12:58.136
THINGS AS YOU.

02:12:58.203 --> 02:12:59.871
BECAUSE YOU FEEL SECURE IN THAT

02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:02.407
USE FEEL SECURE IN YOUR

02:13:02.474 --> 02:13:03.975
EVALUATION --

02:13:04.042 --> 02:13:06.211
BY LOOK BY ANALYZING JUST THE

02:13:06.278 --> 02:13:08.046
RESEARCH STATEMENT.

02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:10.115
RATHER THAN WHERE THEY DID THEIR

02:13:10.182 --> 02:13:12.184
DEGREE --

SO I KNOW I'M YOUNGER THAN YOU --

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:29.240
BUT ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN OVER

02:22:29.307 --> 02:22:30.475
TWENTY YEARS SINCE I I WAS A LAW

02:22:30.541 --> 02:22:32.343
STUDENT AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL.

02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:34.479
AND THE CO CHAIR OF THE VALLEY

02:22:34.545 --> 02:22:35.480
AND SARAH.

02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:37.882
IN FOUR YEARS LANCE I HAD BEEN

02:22:37.949 --> 02:22:38.583
ADVOCATING.

02:22:38.650 --> 02:22:40.485
FOR THE HIGHER OF AT LEAST ONE

02:22:40.551 --> 02:22:42.587
IN THE HISTORY OF THE LAW SCHOOL

02:22:42.654 --> 02:22:44.222
SINCE ITS FOUNDING.

02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:46.925
IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN WHO WAS

02:22:46.991 --> 02:22:48.126
LATIN ACTS.

02:22:48.192 --> 02:22:49.494
THEN I WENT BACK TWENTY YEARS

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:52.497
LATER FOR MY REUNION IN TWENTY

02:22:52.563 --> 02:22:54.098
SEVENTEEN AND THE LAW SCHOOL HAD

02:22:54.165 --> 02:22:55.633
ONLY HIGHER.

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:56.968
TO FACULTY WHO IDENTIFIED AS

02:22:57.035 --> 02:22:58.269
LATINO.

02:22:58.336 --> 02:23:01.205
AND AS THE ALUMNI MET WITH THE

02:23:01.272 --> 02:23:02.440
YOUNG GENERATION OF LIONS OF

02:23:02.507 --> 02:23:03.308
STUDENTS --

02:23:03.374 --> 02:23:04.909
IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY STILL

02:23:04.976 --> 02:23:06.344
FELT LONELY.

02:23:06.411 --> 02:23:10.448
AND ISOLATED IN THE EXPERIENCE --

02:23:10.515 --> 02:23:11.582
I GUESS I CAN SHARE THE STORY

02:23:11.649 --> 02:23:13.451
FOR TWO REASONS --

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:15.119
ONE IS TO THANK YOU BECAUSE WHAT

02:23:15.186 --> 02:23:17.655
A DIFFERENCE IT WOULD HAVE MADE

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:18.690
IF.

02:23:18.756 --> 02:23:20.391
THE MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE

02:23:20.458 --> 02:23:22.327
HAD JURISDICTION TO TELL HARD

02:23:22.393 --> 02:23:24.729
ROAD WHAT TO DO --

02:23:24.796 --> 02:23:25.563
BUT ALSO IF THEY HAD

02:23:25.630 --> 02:23:26.898
DEMONSTRATED THE COMMITMENT THAT

02:23:26.965 --> 02:23:28.800
YOU ARE DEMONSTRATING.

02:23:28.866 --> 02:23:30.668
TODAY I THINK THAT MANY OF US

02:23:30.735 --> 02:23:33.638
WHO FELT SO LONELY IN OUR ASK.

02:23:33.705 --> 02:23:35.873
WOULD HAVE FELT REALLY EMPOWERED

02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:36.841
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE

02:23:36.908 --> 02:23:40.244
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT --

02:23:40.311 --> 02:23:42.547
I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT --

02:23:42.613 --> 02:23:44.749
WE ARE DOING BETTER THAN HARVARD

02:23:44.816 --> 02:23:46.284
LAW SCHOOL EVEN AS THEY DO HAVE

02:23:46.351 --> 02:23:48.186
MORE RESOURCES --

02:23:48.252 --> 02:23:50.188
I JOINED UC DAVIS A YEAR AND A

02:23:50.254 --> 02:23:53.257
HALF AGO ROUGHLY AND WHEREAS I

02:23:53.324 --> 02:23:55.827
SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION AND

02:23:55.893 --> 02:23:56.394
URGENCY WITH.

02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:59.998
OUR WHAT WE SEE IS A LACK OF

02:24:00.064 --> 02:24:00.898
PROGRESS IN.

02:24:00.965 --> 02:24:05.169
OUR DIVERT THE FACULTY RANKS --

02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:06.504
IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING AND

02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:08.106
I DO WANT TO TELL YOU A FEW OF

02:24:08.172 --> 02:24:09.741
THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN.

02:24:09.807 --> 02:24:13.011
DOING -- BUT

02:24:13.077 --> 02:24:15.747
IN MY REMARKS I DO WANT REFER.

02:24:15.813 --> 02:24:16.881
TO AND THERE WAS A BLUE FOLDER

02:24:16.948 --> 02:24:20.218
AND THERE'S A HAND OUT --

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:21.285
AND I WANT TO START WITH THE

02:24:21.352 --> 02:24:22.820
SECOND PAGE --

02:24:22.887 --> 02:24:25.490
THERE IS A GRAPH THAT MY

02:24:25.556 --> 02:24:26.824
ANALYSTS PUT TOGETHER THAT I

02:24:26.891 --> 02:24:28.459
THINK IT'S A VERY TELLING CRAFT

02:24:28.526 --> 02:24:30.862
AND MAY PROVIDE.

02:24:30.928 --> 02:24:32.430
SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE

02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:34.232
STRUGGLE SO MUCH TO DIVERSIFY

02:24:34.298 --> 02:24:36.434
THE FACULTY ONE SO WHAT THIS

02:24:36.501 --> 02:24:39.337
DOES IS IT KIND OF GIVES US A

02:24:39.404 --> 02:24:41.039
PICTURE OF THE FACULTY AT UC

02:24:41.105 --> 02:24:43.941
DAVIS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY THE

02:24:44.008 --> 02:24:45.977
DATE OF HIRE.

02:24:46.044 --> 02:24:48.413
AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT.

02:24:48.479 --> 02:24:50.982
THE FACULTY AT UC DAVIS IN

02:24:51.049 --> 02:24:51.649
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT LEAST ONE OF

02:24:51.716 --> 02:24:52.583
THEM.

02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:56.387
DATES BACK ALL THE WAY TO

02:24:56.454 --> 02:24:56.988
NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THAT'S WHEN

02:24:57.055 --> 02:24:57.388
THEY WERE HIRED.

02:24:57.455 --> 02:24:59.257
THAT MEANS THAT.

02:24:59.323 --> 02:25:01.325
OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO SO WHAT WE

02:25:01.392 --> 02:25:04.462
KNOW RIGHT IS THAT ONCE HIRED

02:25:04.529 --> 02:25:06.564
FACULTY STAY IN GENERAL FOR A

02:25:06.631 --> 02:25:07.999
REALLY REALLY LONG TIME AT

02:25:08.066 --> 02:25:09.467
INSTITUTIONS.

02:25:09.534 --> 02:25:11.102
BUT THE OTHER IMPORTANT PICTURE

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:13.071
OF THIS GRAPH RIGHT IS THAT WHAT

02:25:13.137 --> 02:25:14.572
YOU SEE IS THAT WE HAVE A LEGACY

02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:16.841
OF WHITENESS RIDE IS THAT WE

02:25:16.908 --> 02:25:19.444
DIDN'T ACTUALLY START TO HIRE.

02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:20.945
WITH DIVERSE CITY UNTIL THE MORE

02:25:21.012 --> 02:25:23.614
RECENT YEARS AND QUITE FRANKLY

02:25:23.681 --> 02:25:25.817
FROM AT LEAST FROM WHERE I SIT.

02:25:25.883 --> 02:25:28.219
WE CAN ONLY REALLY HIGHLIGHT --

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:30.988
ANY REAL MOVEMENT IN THE LAST

02:25:31.055 --> 02:25:34.592
SEVEN YEARS OR SO --

02:25:34.659 --> 02:25:35.193
FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS BECAUSE

02:25:35.259 --> 02:25:35.426
WE ARE.

02:25:35.493 --> 02:25:38.129
A HIRING WITH GREATER DIVERSITY.

02:25:38.196 --> 02:25:39.564
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A CERTAIN TYPE

02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:41.199
OF DIVERSITY IN PREVIOUS YEARS

02:25:41.265 --> 02:25:43.101
YOU KNOW DIVERSITY WAS NOT THAT

02:25:43.167 --> 02:25:44.802
IT'S NOT AND IT'S NOT A A DIG

02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:48.072
AGAINST IF WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT

02:25:48.139 --> 02:25:49.474
OF RANGE IN THE TYPES OF

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:51.008
DIVERSITY THAT WENT BUT THAT WAS

02:25:51.075 --> 02:25:51.742
BEING.

02:25:51.809 --> 02:25:53.478
HIRED AT UC DAVIS UNTIL THE LAST

02:25:53.544 --> 02:25:55.813
SEVEN YEARS OR SO.

02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:58.116
SO I THINK THAT'S THE TELEGRAPH.

02:25:58.182 --> 02:25:59.817
AND I THINK PART OF THE QUESTION

02:25:59.884 --> 02:26:02.520
THEN BECOMES WHAT'S DIFFERENT

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:03.788
YOU KNOW WHAT IS.

02:26:03.855 --> 02:26:05.890
HAPPENING IN THE LAST SEVEN

02:26:05.957 --> 02:26:07.558
YEARS OR SO THAT'S MAKING.

02:26:07.625 --> 02:26:08.926
A DIFFERENCE I ALSO WANT TO

02:26:08.993 --> 02:26:09.861
HIGHLIGHT --

02:26:09.927 --> 02:26:11.996
I GUESS.

02:26:12.063 --> 02:26:13.831
TO A PIGGY BACK OFF OF VICE

02:26:13.898 --> 02:26:16.000
PROVOST FOR AB PROPOSED BROWN'S

02:26:16.067 --> 02:26:16.868
ENTHUSIASM.

02:26:16.934 --> 02:26:18.436
I'M I DO THINK THAT.

02:26:18.503 --> 02:26:20.738
THIS IMAGE OF DIVERSITY CREATE

02:26:20.805 --> 02:26:22.240
THE CRITICAL MASS AND I DO

02:26:22.306 --> 02:26:24.075
BELIEVE THAT ONCE YOU HAVE A

02:26:24.142 --> 02:26:25.243
CRITICAL MASS.

02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:26.878
I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:30.948
SEE A REPLICATION OF THE SAME

02:26:31.015 --> 02:26:33.017
SIMILAR TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS

02:26:33.084 --> 02:26:34.418
THAT I HOPE WILL WILL AT SPEED

02:26:34.485 --> 02:26:36.320
UP SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE

02:26:36.387 --> 02:26:36.954
ARE UNDERTAKING AT LEAST THAT'S

02:26:37.021 --> 02:26:40.191
MY HOPE --

02:26:40.258 --> 02:26:41.325
BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS

02:26:41.392 --> 02:26:42.593
DIFFERENT THE TYPES OF

02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:44.729
INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN.

02:26:44.795 --> 02:26:46.731
DOING -- ON

02:26:46.797 --> 02:26:48.900
THE NEXT PAGE --

02:26:48.966 --> 02:26:50.568
WE TRY TO SHOW YOU --

02:26:50.635 --> 02:26:51.836
THROUGH THESE VERY AS BLUE

02:26:51.903 --> 02:26:55.039
CIRCLES WHAT THE HIRING PROCESS

02:26:55.106 --> 02:26:57.441
LOOKS LIKE AT UC DAVIS FROM

02:26:57.508 --> 02:26:58.843
RECRUITMENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

02:26:58.910 --> 02:27:01.479
HIGHER AND ON THE SIDE WE'VE

02:27:01.546 --> 02:27:03.047
IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:05.383
INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT

02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:06.817
IN PLACE PARTICULARLY IN RECENT

02:27:06.884 --> 02:27:09.787
YEARS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE --

02:27:09.854 --> 02:27:11.923
THE WAY THAT WE HIGHER WITH.

02:27:11.989 --> 02:27:16.093
DIVERSITY.

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:17.094
I'M GONNA HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW

02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:18.429
OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS.

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:19.664
BUT I DO WANT TO SAY.

02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:19.997
THAT.

02:27:20.064 --> 02:27:21.432
IN MY MIND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:27:21.499 --> 02:27:22.667
THINGS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO

02:27:22.733 --> 02:27:24.302
SUCCESS THAT I THINK ARE

02:27:24.368 --> 02:27:26.370
CRITICAL TO HIGHLIGHT.

02:27:26.437 --> 02:27:28.272
I'M FIRST IS THAT MOST OF THESE

02:27:28.339 --> 02:27:30.474
INNOVATIONS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED

02:27:30.541 --> 02:27:32.877
BY COMMITTED AND ENGAGE FACULTY.

02:27:32.944 --> 02:27:34.212
AND WITH SUPPORT OF THE ACADEMIC

02:27:34.278 --> 02:27:35.713
SENATE -- I

02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:38.583
HAPPEN TO JOIN UC DAVIS --

02:27:38.649 --> 02:27:40.585
RECENTLY AFTER WE RECEIVED A

02:27:40.651 --> 02:27:42.553
GRANT FROM ADVANCE THE NATIONAL

02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:45.356
SCIENCE FOUNDATION IN.

02:27:45.423 --> 02:27:46.224
TWENTY TWELVE AND THE OTHER

02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:47.858
SOUTH SAID.

02:27:47.925 --> 02:27:50.027
FIRST OF ALL IT WAS A BUNCH OF

02:27:50.094 --> 02:27:51.929
WOMEN SCIENTIST.

02:27:51.996 --> 02:27:53.764
WHO SAW AROUND TODAY SAID WE

02:27:53.831 --> 02:27:55.766
CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO THINGS LIKE

02:27:55.833 --> 02:27:56.434
THIS WE HAVE TO MAKE A

02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:57.401
DIFFERENCE?

02:27:57.468 --> 02:27:58.035
AND THEY WANT TO THE AND THE

02:27:58.102 --> 02:27:59.904
STAFF AND THEY TRIED A COUPLE OF

02:27:59.971 --> 02:28:01.505
TIMES THE FIRST TIME IN

02:28:01.572 --> 02:28:03.107
SUCCESSFULLY THE SECOND TIME.

02:28:03.174 --> 02:28:05.009
BECAUSE THE NSF SAID YOU GOTTA

02:28:05.076 --> 02:28:07.411
FOCUS ON STEM AT THE

02:28:07.478 --> 02:28:09.313
INTERSECTION OF RACE AND GENDER --

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:10.114
AND IT WAS REALLY THIS

02:28:10.181 --> 02:28:11.983
COLLECTIVE EFFORT OF THE FACULTY

02:28:12.049 --> 02:28:14.885
WITH A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM THE

02:28:14.952 --> 02:28:16.687
ADMINISTRATION LEADERSHIP.

02:28:16.754 --> 02:28:18.522
THAT RESULTED IN.

02:28:18.589 --> 02:28:21.125
THE HIGHER OF NARAL THIRTY

02:28:21.192 --> 02:28:22.760
FACULTY MEMBERS WHO ARE BRINGING

02:28:22.827 --> 02:28:23.928
MULTICULTURAL PERSPECTIVE SINCE

02:28:23.995 --> 02:28:25.463
DAM -- TO UC

02:28:25.529 --> 02:28:27.198
DAVIS AND AND I BELIEVE IN THAT

02:28:27.265 --> 02:28:28.299
MODEL SO ONE OF THE FIRST

02:28:28.366 --> 02:28:29.400
PRESCRIPTIONS.

02:28:29.467 --> 02:28:31.002
IS THE COMMITMENT OF FACULTY

02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:32.703
SUPPORT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE

02:28:32.770 --> 02:28:34.338
BUT OBVIOUSLY CLOSE

02:28:34.405 --> 02:28:36.574
COLLABORATION WITH A

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:39.210
ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP.

02:28:39.277 --> 02:28:40.544
I'M THE SECOND THING I WANT TO

02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:43.014
SAY IS THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.815
WE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT.

02:28:44.882 --> 02:28:46.117
PEOPLE WILL DO THIS JUST BECAUSE

02:28:46.183 --> 02:28:47.685
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHAT

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:49.587
I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT YOU KINDA

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:51.389
NEED CARROTS IT'S THE REALITY

02:28:51.455 --> 02:28:53.124
CHANGING CULTURE IS REALLY

02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:54.492
DIFFICULT TO DO.

02:28:54.558 --> 02:28:56.394
AND UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THAT

02:28:56.460 --> 02:28:58.696
REQUIRES INTENSE INCENTIVIZING

02:28:58.763 --> 02:29:00.264
PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

02:29:00.331 --> 02:29:03.434
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE CARE

02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:05.369
VERSUS HAVE MATTERED --

02:29:05.436 --> 02:29:06.737
IN I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THAT

02:29:06.804 --> 02:29:08.472
OUR PARTNERS IN THAT REGARD ARE

02:29:08.539 --> 02:29:09.740
IMPORTANT INCLUDING YOUR

02:29:09.807 --> 02:29:11.409
PARTNERSHIP UC DAVIS HAS

02:29:11.475 --> 02:29:13.778
RECEIVED. TWO GRANTS TOTALING

02:29:13.844 --> 02:29:15.579
MORE THAN THEM MILLION DOLLARS

02:29:15.646 --> 02:29:17.815
THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO INNOVATE

02:29:17.882 --> 02:29:19.250
SO WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT --

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:21.419
I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT UC DAVIS

02:29:21.485 --> 02:29:24.055
HAS ALSO INVESTED SUBSTANTIALLY

02:29:24.121 --> 02:29:25.756
TO AND INCENTIVIZE HIRING.

02:29:25.823 --> 02:29:27.091
WITH DIVERSE AND I WANT TO CALL

02:29:27.158 --> 02:29:28.859
YOUR ATTENTION.

02:29:28.926 --> 02:29:31.329
TO THIS THAT THE NEXT PAGE AND

02:29:31.395 --> 02:29:32.463
THAT SHOWS --

02:29:32.530 --> 02:29:34.365
AT THE VERY BOTTOM YOU SEE THESE

02:29:34.432 --> 02:29:35.866
LITTLE FIGURES.

02:29:35.933 --> 02:29:37.735
THAT INCLUDES THE THIRTY HIGHER

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:39.303
IS THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH MULTI

02:29:39.370 --> 02:29:40.971
CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES ALL OF

02:29:41.038 --> 02:29:42.873
THEM CAME AS A RESULT OF

02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:44.375
INCENTIVES AND THE INCENTIVES.

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:46.711
ARE IN THE AMOUNT OF EIGHTY FIVE

02:29:46.777 --> 02:29:48.579
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR

02:29:48.646 --> 02:29:50.081
FIVE YEARS TO INCENTIVIZE THESE

02:29:50.147 --> 02:29:51.782
HIRES AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A A

02:29:51.849 --> 02:29:53.918
STEADY COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF

02:29:53.984 --> 02:29:55.586
UC DAVIS IS AN OVER. THREE

02:29:55.653 --> 02:29:57.421
MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO DO

02:29:57.488 --> 02:30:00.591
WHAT'S THIRTY HIGHER OF THIRTY

02:30:00.658 --> 02:30:03.094
FIVE FACULTY --

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:04.462
AND THEN AS THEY READ AS THE

02:30:04.528 --> 02:30:05.696
CYCLE OUT OF THE FIVE YEARS OF

02:30:05.763 --> 02:30:07.431
INCENTIVIZE MONIES WE HIRE MORE

02:30:07.498 --> 02:30:08.833
SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT THIS

02:30:08.899 --> 02:30:09.867
MODEL WHICH HAS PROVEN

02:30:09.934 --> 02:30:11.669
SUCCESSFUL SO FAR WILL CONTINUE

02:30:11.736 --> 02:30:12.536
TO HELP US.

02:30:12.603 --> 02:30:16.240
TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS.

02:30:16.307 --> 02:30:17.308
I WANT TO SAY THAT PROCESS

02:30:17.375 --> 02:30:18.943
MATTERS A LOT AND ONE OF THE

02:30:19.009 --> 02:30:20.878
THINGS AND CHAIRMAN MEDINA THAT

02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:22.213
YOU MENTIONED WAS.

02:30:22.279 --> 02:30:23.114
THE TENDENCY --

02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:25.916
WANTING TO REPLICATE YOURSELF --

02:30:25.983 --> 02:30:27.885
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M

02:30:27.952 --> 02:30:29.720
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT --

02:30:29.787 --> 02:30:32.256
IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE MANY

02:30:32.323 --> 02:30:34.692
WAYS INCENTIVIZING THROUGH THE

02:30:34.759 --> 02:30:36.260
NEW GRANT THAT WERE RECEIVED

02:30:36.327 --> 02:30:37.928
FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE.

02:30:37.995 --> 02:30:39.463
BUT ALSO --

02:30:39.530 --> 02:30:42.466
USING A BIT OF A STICK MODEL TO

02:30:42.533 --> 02:30:44.835
FOREST'S NOT FORCE BUT REALLY

02:30:44.902 --> 02:30:48.806
REALLY INCENTIVIZE OPEN SEARCHES.

02:30:48.873 --> 02:30:50.408
RIGHT RATHER THAN THE

02:30:50.474 --> 02:30:52.042
SPECIALIZED NARAL SEARCHES THAT

02:30:52.109 --> 02:30:54.211
YOU'VE DESCRIBED --

02:30:54.278 --> 02:30:58.382
IN EIGHT COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS --

02:30:58.449 --> 02:31:00.317
AND THE DEANS HAVE COMMITTED TO

02:31:00.384 --> 02:31:01.886
THAT MODEL --

02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:03.821
I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT

02:31:03.888 --> 02:31:05.790
BECAUSE THEY ALSO COMMITTED. TWO

02:31:05.856 --> 02:31:07.158
A MODEL WHERE THEY WILL ALLOW

02:31:07.224 --> 02:31:08.726
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP

02:31:08.793 --> 02:31:10.928
INCLUDING MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS.

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:12.930
TO SIT AS PART OF THE HIRING

02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:14.465
COMMITTEES AND IN ORDER.

02:31:14.532 --> 02:31:16.033
TO TALK ABOUT THE BEST PRACTICES

02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:17.368
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING

02:31:17.435 --> 02:31:18.369
AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE

02:31:18.436 --> 02:31:19.336
PRESENT.

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:22.173
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

02:31:22.239 --> 02:31:23.407
I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:25.109
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES I THINK

02:31:25.176 --> 02:31:26.110
ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE DOING

02:31:26.177 --> 02:31:26.877
THAT.

02:31:26.944 --> 02:31:28.379
BUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:30.448
DO MATTER AND THEY FUNCTION VERY

02:31:30.514 --> 02:31:31.882
SIMILARLY.

02:31:31.949 --> 02:31:34.952
ACROSS CAMPUSES WHICH IS THAT.

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:36.320
WE DO ASK.

02:31:36.387 --> 02:31:38.622
EVERY SINGLE SEARCH TO GIVE US

02:31:38.689 --> 02:31:40.724
THEIR NUMBERS IN TERMS OF THE

02:31:40.791 --> 02:31:42.760
SHORT LIST THE AND THE ALSO THE

02:31:42.827 --> 02:31:43.961
NUMBER OF CANDIDTES.

02:31:44.028 --> 02:31:44.962
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BRING BACK

02:31:45.029 --> 02:31:48.766
TO CAMPUS TO YOU AND WE COMPARE

02:31:48.833 --> 02:31:51.402
THEM AGAINST NORMS --

02:31:51.469 --> 02:31:52.670
FOR BASICALLY THE SHORTLIST ARE

02:31:52.736 --> 02:31:54.104
REVIEWED TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:31:54.171 --> 02:31:56.006
APPLICANT POOL AND SELECTED

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:58.275
CANDIDATES ARE CONSISTENT WITH

02:31:58.342 --> 02:31:59.977
THE WORKFORCE AVAILABILITY POOL.

02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:00.945
AND WHERE IS THIS IS SORT OF A

02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:02.580
SOFT PRESSURE ON THE SEARCH

02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:06.217
COMMITTEES I DO FIND THAT TEENS

02:32:06.283 --> 02:32:08.352
DON'T WANT TO GET THAT CALL FROM

02:32:08.419 --> 02:32:11.355
THE VICE PROVOST TO SAY WHY IS

02:32:11.422 --> 02:32:12.723
THERE NO MATCH.

02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:13.791
AND I DO THINK IT CREATES A

02:32:13.858 --> 02:32:15.960
CULTURE OF KNOWING THAT THE

02:32:16.026 --> 02:32:17.528
INSTITUTION CARES ABOUT THIS

02:32:17.595 --> 02:32:18.562
ISSUE.

02:32:18.629 --> 02:32:20.130
AND IT SLOWLY STARTS TO CHIP

02:32:20.197 --> 02:32:22.466
AWAY AT THE NON ACCOUNTABILITY

02:32:22.533 --> 02:32:24.435
IN WHICH FACULTY HAVE GENERALLY

02:32:24.502 --> 02:32:27.037
HIRED IN THE PAST.

02:32:27.104 --> 02:32:29.106
I WANT TO TALK ALSO A LITTLE BIT

02:32:29.173 --> 02:32:30.641
ABOUT --

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:32.576
RETENTION.

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:35.613
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS HAND

02:32:35.679 --> 02:32:36.847
OUT OF WE'VE LISTED SOME OF THE

02:32:36.914 --> 02:32:38.282
IT RETENTION INITIATIVES AND

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:39.617
BECAUSE OF TIME.

02:32:39.683 --> 02:32:41.151
I WON'T TALK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE

02:32:41.218 --> 02:32:42.953
INITIATIVES.

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.822
BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST

02:32:44.889 --> 02:32:46.524
TWO ONE IS ONE THAT I HAVE BEEN

02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:48.592
LEADING WITH --

02:32:48.659 --> 02:32:51.228
A FACULTY DIRECTOR MARY LOU

02:32:51.295 --> 02:32:52.396
DELLUMS FEELINGS AND SO THE

02:32:52.463 --> 02:32:55.533
FACULTY SCHOLARS THAT WE MENTION

02:32:55.599 --> 02:32:56.567
TO YOU THE THIRTY FACULTY

02:32:56.634 --> 02:32:58.569
SCHOLARS THEY ARE PART OF A

02:32:58.636 --> 02:33:00.271
COHORT OF FACULTY.

02:33:00.337 --> 02:33:02.573
THAT WE CALLED CAMPBELL'S AND

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:05.609
CUMPLE STAND A MULTIPLE CULTURAL

02:33:05.676 --> 02:33:07.111
PERSPECTIVES ON SCIENCE.

02:33:07.177 --> 02:33:08.546
SO WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR

02:33:08.612 --> 02:33:09.914
PRESENCE ON CAMPUS WAS GONNA BE

02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:11.882
TRANSFORMATIVE BUT WE ALSO

02:33:11.949 --> 02:33:13.317
UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY NEEDED TO

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:15.853
BE SUPPORTED AND MADE VISIBLE

02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:16.954
AND THAT THERE THAT THEY WE

02:33:17.021 --> 02:33:18.222
NEEDED TO BUILD A COMMUNITY

02:33:18.289 --> 02:33:19.490
AROUND THEM.

02:33:19.557 --> 02:33:21.425
AND I AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT --

02:33:21.492 --> 02:33:22.226
WE HAVE DONE THAT QUITE

02:33:22.293 --> 02:33:23.694
SUCCESSFULLY AND NOW WE'RE

02:33:23.761 --> 02:33:25.095
TRYING TO REPLICATE.

02:33:25.162 --> 02:33:26.764
ON A SIMILAR MODEL FOR FOR

02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:29.099
FACULTY IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES

02:33:29.166 --> 02:33:32.136
HUMANITIES AND THE ARTS.

02:33:32.202 --> 02:33:32.937
I'M LET ME --

02:33:33.003 --> 02:33:34.805
FINALLY TALK ABOUT THE PIPELINE

WHICH IS ALL OF MERITOCRACY

02:35:40.064 --> 02:35:40.931

WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:49:16.613 --> 02:49:18.882

02:49:18.948 --> 02:49:20.583
THAT THOSE WORDS MEAN I'M AND

02:49:20.650 --> 02:49:22.018

MENTOR SHIP FROM WOMEN OF COLOR --

02:49:32.662 --> 02:49:34.397
THE FACT THAT I CANNOT SAY THE

02:57:04.113 --> 02:57:05.147
MY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE

02:57:05.214 --> 02:57:06.449
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STARTED

02:57:06.515 --> 02:57:08.818
A FIFTY FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN I

02:57:08.884 --> 02:57:11.153
KNOW THAT DURING THAT TIME YOU

SEE HAS BEEN CONTROLLED

02:57:12.455 --> 02:57:14.156
CRITICIZED AND SOMETIMES

02:57:14.223 --> 02:57:15.691
ATTACKED FOR THE FACT THAT IT

02:57:15.758 --> 02:57:16.826

ARE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVELS. FOR

02:57:24.767 --> 02:57:26.035
THE PAST FIFTY YEARS REPORTS

02:57:29.071 --> 02:57:29.638
MADE.

02:57:29.705 --> 02:57:31.240
AND GOALS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED

02:57:31.307 --> 02:57:32.842
AND THOSE GOALS AND PROMISES

02:57:32.908 --> 02:57:36.912
HAVE NOT BEEN MET.

02:57:36.979 --> 02:57:38.981
HEY YOU SEE I WAS A STUDENT.

02:57:39.048 --> 02:57:39.815

CHANCELLORS AND MOST RECENTLY A

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:45.621
A DOT A DONOR.

02:57:45.688 --> 02:57:48.491
I WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN YOU SEE

02:57:48.557 --> 02:57:50.259
WANTS TO DO SOMETHING.

02:57:50.326 --> 02:57:51.327
IT CAN.

02:57:51.394 --> 02:57:53.095
THEY TOOK THREE CAMPUSES THAT

02:57:53.162 --> 02:57:54.997
WERE THAT WERE YOUNG AND MADE

02:57:55.064 --> 02:57:55.965
THEM INTO A WORLD CLASS

02:57:56.032 --> 02:57:58.267
UNIVERSITY SAYS WITNESSED BY

02:57:58.334 --> 02:58:00.369
IRVINE SANTA CRUZ AND THE SAN

02:58:00.436 --> 02:58:01.270
DIEGO CAMPUS.

02:58:01.337 --> 02:58:03.205
IT ALSO TOOK.

02:58:03.272 --> 02:58:05.074
I AND CREATED A BRAND NEW CAMPUS

02:58:05.141 --> 02:58:06.976
FROM NOTHING AS WITNESSED BY YOU

02:58:07.043 --> 02:58:08.044
SEE MERCED.

02:58:08.110 --> 02:58:09.745
WHEN YOU SEE WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH

02:58:09.812 --> 02:58:11.447
SOMETHING IT CAN ADD DOES AT THE

02:58:11.514 --> 02:58:12.948
HIGHEST LEVELS WHEN YOU SEE

02:58:13.015 --> 02:58:14.617
ESTABLISHES GOALS THAT HE WANTS

02:58:14.683 --> 02:58:16.886
TO MEET IT CAN WHEN YOU SEE

02:58:16.952 --> 02:58:18.487
WANTS TO ACQUIRE FUNDS WHEN FOR

02:58:18.554 --> 02:58:20.022
NEW ENDEAVORS IT DOES?

02:58:20.089 --> 02:58:22.591
WHEN YOU SEE WANTS TO IT DOES?

02:58:22.658 --> 02:58:25.928
THAT BEGS THE QUESTION WHY SEE

02:58:25.995 --> 02:58:28.097
OF CALIFORNIA NOT HAVE THE

02:58:28.164 --> 02:58:29.932
REPRESENTATION OF CHICANOS AND

CHECK ON US AMONG ITS FACULTY.

02:58:32.334 --> 02:58:34.303
AND IN --

02:58:34.370 --> 02:58:36.138
HIGHER ADMINISTRATION.

02:58:36.205 --> 02:58:37.940
I BELIEVE THAT THAT LACK OF ROOM

02:58:38.007 --> 02:58:39.809
REPRESENTATION IS NOT FROM

02:58:39.875 --> 02:58:41.844
MALICE AFORETHOUGHT BUT RATHER

02:58:41.911 --> 02:58:43.646
THAT THE SIMPLE FACT THE PUTTING

02:58:43.712 --> 02:58:45.147
US IN POSITIONS OF INFLUENCE.

02:58:45.214 --> 02:58:47.750
IS JUST NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH NOT

02:58:47.817 --> 02:58:49.718
ENOUGH OF A PRIORITY NOT CRUCIAL

02:58:49.785 --> 02:58:50.719
TO THE UNIVERSITY'S

02:58:50.786 --> 02:58:52.521
INTERNATIONAL STANDING NOR

02:58:52.588 --> 02:58:54.290
DEPENDENT FOR FUTURE GROWTH WHEN

02:58:54.356 --> 02:58:55.524
STAFFING PLANS ARE MADE OR

02:58:55.591 --> 02:58:56.759
HIRING DECISIONS ARE MADE

02:58:56.826 --> 02:58:58.461
INCLUDING US.

02:58:58.527 --> 02:59:01.263
IS JUST NOT A MAJOR FACTOR I

02:59:01.330 --> 02:59:02.865
KNOW I WAS THERE.

02:59:02.932 --> 02:59:04.166
YOU SEE LEADERSHIP.

02:59:04.233 --> 02:59:05.901
FACES THE DILEMMA OF HAVING A

02:59:05.968 --> 02:59:08.170
STATED GOAL NOT MATCHED BY THE

02:59:08.237 --> 02:59:09.772
DESIRE WITHIN ITS RANKS TO

02:59:09.839 --> 02:59:11.006
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.

02:59:11.073 --> 02:59:14.076
I ASK WHAT DETRIMENTAL ACTION

02:59:14.143 --> 02:59:15.544
HAS BEEN IT HAS BEEN AFFECTED.

02:59:15.611 --> 02:59:17.580
OF YOU SEE BECAUSE IT HAS NOT

02:59:17.646 --> 02:59:19.248
MET ITS OWN STATED GOALS.

02:59:19.315 --> 02:59:20.783
WHAT HAS OCCURRED WITHIN YOU SEE

02:59:20.850 --> 02:59:22.551
BECAUSE IT HAS NOT MET ITS OWN

02:59:22.618 --> 02:59:24.520
STATED GOALS THE ANSWER IS VERY

02:59:24.587 --> 02:59:27.189
LITTLE I KNOW I WAS THERE?

02:59:27.256 --> 02:59:28.557
I HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR

02:59:28.624 --> 02:59:30.259
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:59:30.326 --> 02:59:31.026
THAT I HAVE WITNESSED FROM THE

02:59:31.093 --> 02:59:32.094
INSIDE.

02:59:32.161 --> 02:59:33.462
I HAVE WATCHED YOU SEE FOR MANY

02:59:33.529 --> 02:59:35.731
YEARS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS AND

02:59:35.798 --> 02:59:37.500
MEET IMPROBABLE GOALS.

02:59:37.566 --> 02:59:39.702
WE AT THE UC SYSTEM DO NOT WANT

02:59:39.768 --> 02:59:41.137
FOR INNOVATIVE THINKING OR

02:59:41.203 --> 02:59:43.105
QUALITY ADMINISTRATION.

02:59:43.172 --> 02:59:44.173
THE FAILURE TO PLACE LET THE

02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:45.508
NASCENT LATINOS INTO

02:59:45.574 --> 02:59:47.276
ADMINISTRATIVE IN FACT THE RANKS

02:59:47.343 --> 02:59:49.145
IS A LACK OF COMMITMENT NOT

02:59:49.211 --> 02:59:50.312
CAPACITY.

02:59:50.379 --> 02:59:52.181
IF WE CAN'T DO IT IS NOT BECAUSE

02:59:52.248 --> 02:59:54.049
IT'S HARD BUT WE CAN BECAUSE WE

02:59:54.116 --> 02:59:57.753
YOU SEE JUST DO NOT CARE ENOUGH.

02:59:57.820 --> 02:59:59.755
MY MASTER MY PAST EXPERIENCE

02:59:59.822 --> 03:00:01.223
