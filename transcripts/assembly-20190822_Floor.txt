COLLEAGUES I AM HONORED TODAY TO HELP RECOGNIZE AN INSTITUTION IN OUR STATE CAPITOL AS THE CHAIR OF THE PILOTS TO THE CAUCUS I'M HERE TO RECOGNIZE AN INSTITUTION THAT ALL OF US KNOW FOR THEIR FAMOUS BANANA CREAM PIES THE MANY EVENTS THAT ARE HELD THERE AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA HISTORY WITHIN THEIR WALLS OF COURSE ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT I'M REFERRING TO THE INSTITUTION KNOWN AS- FRANK FATS RESTAURANT. AND AS A CHAIR. AS A CHAIR THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO HONOR THE FAT FAMILY AS WE RECOGNIZE THEIR EIGHTIETH ANNIVERSARY. FRANK FATS HOLDS MANY STORIES OF OUR CAPITAL COMMUNITY MANY POLITICAL LUMINARIES INCLUDING EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR SINCE FOR A WARRANT HAD DINED HERE SINCE IT OPENED IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE. THIS INSTITUTION WAS PART OF AN ERA WHERE DEAL MAKING OFTEN TOOK PLACE BETWEEN MEALS INVOLVING LEGISLATORS AND FOLKS OUTSIDE OF THIS BUILDING. APPS THE MOST FAMOUS DEAL BROKERED AT FRANK FATS WAS A LEGENDARY NAPKIN DEAL THAT RESULTED IN TORT REFORM. BUT MANY EOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT BEHIND THIS VERY SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT IS A STORY OF A CHINESE IMMIGRANT WHO LACKED DOCUMENTATION WHOSE ENCHANTED BY AMERICA'S GOLD MOUNTAIN FRANK FAT. DESPITE THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT FRANK IMMIGRATED TO OUR COUNTRY THE AGE OF SIXTEEN HE WAS DETAINED AT ANGEL ISLAND IMMIGRATION STATION AND AFTER HIS RELEASE WORKED AS A FRUIT PICKER. A DISHWASHER AND A WAITER UNTIL HE RECEIVED HIS LUCKY BREAK FROM RESTAURANT CUSTOMER. FRANK HELD ON TO THE CUSTOMER EARNINGS AT THE CASH EARNINGS OF A CUSTOMER WHO HAD PURCHASED A KINO TICKET. AND LEFT BEFORE THE GAME BEGAN. IN APPRECIATION OF FRANK'S HONESTY THE CUSTOMER HELPED HIM SECURE A LOAN FOR FRANK TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY AT EIGHT OO SIX ELSTREE. FATS RESTAURANT SUCCESS WAS BORN OUT OF HARD WORK KINDNESS AND THE DREAMS OF AN IMMIGRANT. HIS RESTAURANT AND HE AND HIS FAMILY ARE SYMBOL OF OUR AMERICAN DREAM AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF IMMIGRANTS IN AMERICA. FRANK FATS IS STILL A FAMILY RUN BUSINESS TODAY WITH THREE OTHER RESTAURANTS IN THE CATERING BUSINESS AND THEY RECENTLY EARNED A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MICHELIN RECOGNITION.

ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR BY FAMILY MEMBER MULLIN AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO ELECTIONS. MR MAILING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT A SEE A FOR WHICH WOULD ALLOW SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO VOTE IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE EIGHTEEN BY THE TIME OF THE GENERAL ELECTION. ACA. FOR WOULD CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE CALIFORNIA'S YOUNGEST VOTER DEMOGRAPHIC AND BOOST YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN OUR ELECTIONS. THIS IDEA IS NOT A NEW ONE NEARLY HALF OF STATES LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN NEARLY HALF OF STATES IN THE U. S. ALREADY ALLOW SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO PARTICIPATE IN PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES. FIRST TIME VOTERS SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A FULL ELECTION CYCLE. IN FACT THIS IDEA FIRST APPEARED IN THIS BUILDING SOME SIXTEEN YEARS AGO. WHEN MY FATHER A FORMER THIRTY FIVE YOUR CIVICS TEACHER PROPOSED. AND THE MULLENS PLURAL HAVE MADE ADDITIONAL ATTEMPTS ON THIS FLOOR AND IN THIS BUILDING BUT MEMBERS THIS IS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS FINALLY COME. THIS EFFORT IS A SIMPLE PREMISE IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE AS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD IN THE GENERAL ELECTION YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HELP SHAPE THE CHOICES THAT APPEAR ON THE GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT BY VOTING IN THE PRIMARY. WE ARE TREATING IT SHOULD BE TREATED AS AN ELECTION CYCLE PRIMARY AND GENERAL AND- WE ANCHOR THIS EFFORT. IN YOUNG PEOPLE BECOMING EIGHTEEN AND HOPEFULLY HABITUAL VOTERS CALIFORNIA IS IN THE UNUSUAL POSITION OF PLAYING CATCH UP ON CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. ILLINOIS INDIANA KENTUCKY. MISSISSIPPI OHIO AND SOUTH CAROLINA ARE JUST A HANDFUL OF THE STATE'S WHERE THIS IS ALREADY LAW RED STATES BLUE STATES AND PURPLE STATES AS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ACA FOR WE GO BEFORE THE VOTERS. WE WOULD ULTIMATELY BE GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THIS DECISION. YET I AM FULLY OPTIMISTIC THAT VOTERS WILL EMBRACE THIS MODEST REFORM TO IMPROVE CIVIC PARTICIPATION AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO A CA FOR YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. LARGELY THIS IS BEING YOUR VEIL THAT SOMETHING THAT HELPS EXPAND THE FRANCHISE TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS BUT HAS BEEN MOSTLY A MORE POLITICAL ALTER YOUR MOTIVE IN THE LONG TERM. BECAUSE IF IT WERE REALLY TRUE. IF IT WERE REALLY TRUE THAT WE WANTED TO EXPAND VOTING TO CHILDREN. YOUR TO THOSE WHO ARE MINORS THEN WHY NOT DO THE WHOLE THING WHY NOT GO DOWN TO THIRTEEN YEAH. ONE I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN. WE TALK ABOUT POLITICS A LOT. I WANNA LET ALL MY FIVE CHILDREN YOU KNOW GO AND GO AND VOTE. THE ONLY REASON THAT WE'RE DOING THIS IS BECAUSE. THE OTHER SOME DATA THAT MAYBE SHOWS THAT SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR THE MAJORITY PARTY AND INCREASE THEIR VOTE THRESHOLD IN THIS PRIMARY DAY TO INCREASE THAT THAT NUMBER. IN THIS CURRENT PRIMARY I MEAN THAT'S WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE. IT LOOKED AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE SAID. THAT THE AGE OF MAJORITY IS EIGHTEEN. AND THAT THAT IS WHEN EVERYONE. EVERYONE CAN VOTE WHEN THEY TURN EIGHTEEN. AND THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE REALLY CLOUDED THAT UP. IS THE MAJORITY PARTY IN THIS BUILDING. WHO WHO TELLS US THAT. YES SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WE THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE BUT YOU'RE NOT ADULT ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER NOT TO SMOKE. HE GOT AWAY TO YOUR TWENTY ONE. RIGHT. YEAH YOU'RE AN ADULT IN AT SEVENTEEN THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE AND MAKE DECISIONS. ON THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO KILL SOMEONE. THEY COMMITTED SERIOUS OFFENSE OR SUBMIT A SERIOUS CRIME AGAINST SOMEBODY NO WE THINK UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE YOU'RE REALLY NOT ADULT ENOUGH AND RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO DO THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE CONFUSE THIS ISSUE. IS THIS BODY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. SO EIGHTEEN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT THRESHOLD IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE OUT AND SAY NO WE ACTUALLY THINK. THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE THEN PROPOSE THAT. AND TAKE THAT TO THE VOTERS AND ASK THEM IF THEY WANT TO APPROVE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE BUT DON'T PLAY THIS GAME. ON THIS FOR ABOUT WE'RE REALLY WE REALLY CARE ABOUT THE FRANCHISE WE WANT ALLOW SEVEN WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD AND A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD. WHAT ABOUT A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL WHAT OUR FRESHMAN HIGH SCHOOL THERE. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE DIFFERENT THAN SENIORS. IN HIGH SCHOOL. WHY ARE WE MAKING NO RESEARCH THE I MEAN THERE REALLY IS NO DISTINCTION THAT YOU CAN MAKE IF YOU WANT TO ALLOW CHILDREN TO VOTE THEN PROPOSE THAT. BUT SERIOUSLY LET'S NOT PLAY A GAME HERE TODAY AND SAY THAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY NOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER MISTER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR TO MY A FRIEND. OF FROM NICHOLAS EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS WERE NOT ALWAYS THE THRESHOLD FOR VOTING. THOSE OF YOU VISITED ME IN MY OFFICE MAY HAVE NOTICED ON MY WALL A LETTER SIGNED BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HENRY WAXMAN WHO WAS CONGRATULATING ME AND I'M SURE. MANY OTHERS WHO WERE GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL THAT YEAR AND TURNING EIGHTEEN AND WERE IN THE FIRST COHORT OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCORDED THE ABILITY TO VOTE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. I'M AT THAT TIME THERE WERE PREDICTIONS THAT YOU KNOW WESTERN CIVILIZATION WAS GOING TO FALL AND ALL KINDS OF BAD THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN BECAUSE WE WERE ALLOWING. CHILDREN TO VOTE. YOU KNOW A REASONABLE MINDS MAY DIFFER ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE ME AND A WHAT'S COME THAT BUT- BUT WESTERN CIVILIZATION HAS NOT FALLEN AND I STRONG AND I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM THIS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. I HAVE OBVIOUSLY PRESENTED SIMILAR BILLS IN THE PAST THAT ACTUALLY REDUCE VOTING AGE TO SIXTEEN SO THIS IS SOMETHING I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENGAGE OUR CHILDREN YOUNG PEOPLE CALL MY CHILDREN CHILDREN AT TWENTY TWO SO I CAN CALL MY SIXTEEN YEAR OLD THE CHILD TO BUT YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED WE KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO VOTE THE YOUNGER YOU ARE WHEN YOU CAST THAT FIRST VOTE THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO BE A LIFE LONG VOTER IT'S IMPORTANT. BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T POINT OUT SO I'M COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IDEA. BUT THIS. THE SOLUTION IS NOT UNIQUE IT'S NOT DRIVEN BY A DEMOCRATIC. IDEA IN CALIFORNIA I COULD READ YOU THE STATE'S BY WHICH THIS ALREADY IS IMPLEMENTED STATES LIKE. KENTUCKY IN MISSISSIPPI AND NEBRASKA IN THAT GREAT. PROGRESSIVE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA IN NORTH CAROLINA IN OHIO SO TO SUGGEST THAT THERE'S SOME POLITICAL PLAY GOING ON I THINK IS DISINGENUOUS IT MAKES SENSE THAT A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHO'S GONNA TURN EIGHTEEN BY A GENERAL ELECTION GETS TO GET THEIR FEET WET THIS IS THE MOST COMMON SENSE SHOULD BE EASY FOR ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE WANT THEM ENGAGED IN A PRIMARY ELECTION BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION IT'S GOOD FOR THE PROCESS IT'S GOOD FOR THEM AND IT'S OUR WAY TO DEVELOP LIFELONG VOTERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ MISS CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHICO I REALLY. OR. FIVE CHIEF NICHOLAS MY APOLOGIES MY COLLEAGUE FROM EAST NICHOLAS. MENTIONING HIS FIVE YEAR OLDS BEING ABLE TO VOTE. THAT HAVE TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF A COURT. BECAUSE OF OUR FEDERAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT IS CURRENTLY BROKEN. DEMOCRACY IS NOT A JOKE IT IS NOT SOMETHING TO TAKE LIGHTLY. IF A FIVE YEAR OLD HAS TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES IN IMMIGRATION COURT YOU CANNOT JOKE ABOUT A FIVE YEAR OLD BEING ABLE TO VOTE. THIS IS SOMETHING SERIOUS. THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY IN THE FUTURE OF THE STATE. NICE STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO MISTER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I AM VERY PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE ON THIS ISSUE OF GROWING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. AND IT'S FUNNY I FIND MYSELF THINKING OF MY ABLE DAUGHTER IN LAW CATHERINE COOLEY WHO. JUST COMPLETED HER MASTERS AT USC AND SHE WAS A CROSS COUNTRY RUNNER. AND YOU KNOW IN CROSS COUNTRY YOU CAN INVOLVED IN REPLACE. AND THE ART OF RUNNING. IF YOU ARE PART OF A TEAM RUNNING TEAM IS THE ART OF THE BATON PASS. AND ALL OF US IN PUBLIC LIFE. HAVE TO CONCERN OURSELVES ON HOW IN OUR DEMOCRACY WE PULL OFF THE BATON PASS HOW TO THOSE OF US WHO RISE OF PUBLIC SERVICE TO DEVELOP A SKILL SET. WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE ISSUES OF THE DAY. CULTIVATE A CULTURE WHERE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE. THEY TOO CAN PARTICIPATE. THERE ARE PASSED FOR THEM THIS ORDER THE BATON PASS WHICH IS VITAL IN A DEMOCRACY. I THINK THE ACCELERATED RATE OF CHANGE WAS SHE IN THE WORLD AROUND US TODAY. CONFRONTS PEOPLE EARLIER STAGE WITH THAT. FORCES ARE WORKED OR CONSEQUENTIAL IN THEIR LIVES AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE IT ALL LEADS AND I THINK TO BE A GENERATION OF LAWMAKERS FOLKS OF ON HOW DO WE PASS THE BATON OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. INVITE GREATER PARTICIPATION. IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER. AND SO I THINK THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING IDEA. I AND I. SUPPORT IT AND I THINK IT IS US AS MEMBERS EXECUTE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE GOOD RUNNERS. AND TO PASS THE BATON A BILLION WELL TO THOSE WHO FOLLOW US. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A PARENT OF A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD I RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU. MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED I AM PROUD TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS SOMEONE WHO WAS THE FIRST MILLENNIAL EVER ELECTED. TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE. I KNOW THE VALUE OF GETTING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE YOUNG ENGAGED AND OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AT AN EARLY AGE I VOTED EVER SINCE I TURNED EIGHTEEN I WAS VERY PROUD TO CAST THAT VOTE I CONTINUE TO BE A VOTER EVER SINCE I CAST A FIRST VOTE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WHEN I COULD. BUT I ONLY DID IT BECAUSE AS I HAD A FAMILY THAT WAS INVOLVED IN POLITICS. AND IT WAS CONTINUE REALLY IMPRESSED UPON ME WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. TO BE ENGAGE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND I JUST THINK IT'S A REALLY LAZY ARGUMENT. TO SEE HERE AND SAY THAT THE ONLY REASON WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS. IS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO EARN MORE OPEN MORE VOTERS ON OUR SITE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. BECAUSE IT COULD BE READ JUST AS EASY. TO SAY WELL MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. BECAUSE YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOU BECAUSE YOU CONTINUE TO DEVALUE THEM. AND THEIR PARTICIPATION IN OUR DEMOCRACY DEVALUE THEM AND THEIR IDEAS. ABOUT WHAT THEIR FUTURE SHOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN WE ARE CONSTANTLY EVERY SINGLE DAY MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE GOING TO IMPACT THERE'LL THEIR LIVES. FOR ITS ENTIRETY. SO I THINK THAT WE NEED MORE PEOPLE VOTING MORE PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE NEGATIVE. WHEN YOU HAVE. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING TO BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE. TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A SAY AND WHAT THEIR REPRESENTATION LOW. BECAUSE THAT MATTERS. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MR MILLING YOU MAKE THOSE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THE DISCUSSION LET ME JUST REMIND YOU THIS EFFORT IS ONE THAT IS TIED LEGALLY PEGGED TO PEOPLE BECOMING EIGHTEEN BY THE GENERAL ELECTION SO WHEN IT IS BEEN CHALLENGED IN OF THE STATE'S.
