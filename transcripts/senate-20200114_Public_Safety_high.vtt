NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.574
SOUND LOOKING CALAVERAS COUNTY

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.676
IS THE BAY AREA IF YOU LOOK AT

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:45.645
THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:46.779

AFTER THOSE INCIDENTS WE

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.999
SHOULD. REQUIRE REPORTING BUT-

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:10.470
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN OPT OUT

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:13.039
BUT NO JURISDICTIONS HAVE OPTED

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.574
OUT. IN OUR MANDATING THAT THEY

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.477
CAN OPT OUT I'M JUST. NO LOCAL

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:18.978
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVEN'T

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.913
ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE LINE AND

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.814

ADDITION BUT IT DOESN'T DO ANY

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:02.822
GOOD IF A FAMILY MEMBER HAS

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.866
IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO SEE THIS

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:17.903
BROUGHT BACK AGAIN- AGAIN AT A

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.838

CONTINUOUSLY SPECIALLY VIOLENT

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:06.345
CRIME PRIMARILY VIOLENT CRIME

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:08.914
HAS BEEN IN A DOWNWARD TRENDING

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.682
GOING DOWN EACH YEAR FOR THE

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:12.951
PAST AT LEAST TEN YEARS. NOW

NOT MAKE UNICORN REAL THIRTY

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.525
EATING AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT

00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:21.827
CRIME IS- VIOLENT CRIME IS UP

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:24.196
IN CALIFORNIA OR THAT POLICIES

THAT ARE VOTERS HAVE SUPPORTED.

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:29.268
IS CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR- TO A

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:30.469
TO A TO A HORRIBLE CRISIS OF

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:33.872
SAFETY IS DOES NOT MAKE IT REAL

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:37.543
AND- WHAT I. WHAT I RESPECT

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:39.711
ABOUT CALIFORNIA VOTERS IS THEY

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:42.247
SO FAR HAVE NOT FALLEN FOR THE

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.950
UNICORN ARGUMENT AND I HOPE

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.352
THAT THEY CONTINUE NOT TO FALL

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:50.489
FOR THE UNICORN ARGUMENT. ON I

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:51.089
WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THAT

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.991
THIS BILL I'M DOES PROVISIONS

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:54.893
OF BOTH PROP FORTY SEVEN AM

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.528
PROP FIFTY SEVEN. AND THEN THE

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.797
OTHER ASPECT ON THE DNA WELL I

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:02.334
AM A VERY STRONG ADVOCATE FOR

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:03.769
OUR USE OF DNA IN OUR

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:07.105
COLLECTION OF DNA. IN A SET OF

00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:10.008
CRIMES BECAUSE OF ITS VERY

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:12.177
IMPORTANT EFFICACY IN TERMS OF

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:17.082
OUR- FINDING THE PERPETRATOR-

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:19.318
IDENTIFYING AND SECURING.

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:20.953
APPROPRIATE CHARGES ON THE

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:23.255
PERPETRATOR WE ALSO KNOW NOW

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:24.556
THAT LIKE ANY OF OUR

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:26.191
TECHNOLOGIES THERE ARE DOWN

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:29.561
SIDES TO THAT DNA ON. TO THAT

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:34.266
NEED FOR EXAMPLE. WE ARE NOW

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.134
HAVE EVIDENCE THAT A PERSON

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:36.702
THAT RECEIVED A BONE MARROW

00:20:36.768 --> 00:20:43.108
TRANSPLANT. CAN. CHAU DNA OF

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:44.409
THE PERSON THAT THEY RECEIVE

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:45.777
THE BONE MARROW TRANSPORT

00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:48.513
TRANSPLANT FROM SO THEY COULD

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.848
THAT COULD THEN PUT HEM AT

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.516
RISK OF COURSE OF BEING

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:53.919
CONSIDERED A SUSPECT IN A CRIME

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.387
FOR WHICH THEY HAD NOTHING TO

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:57.923
DO IT NOW WE WOULD HOPE THAT

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.726
ALL OF OUR OTHER INVESTIGATORY

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.027
TOOLS WOULD PROTECT SUCH

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.129
INDIVIDUALS BUT AS WE KNOW IT

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:06.632
IS NOT INFREQUENT FOR PEOPLE TO

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:07.499
BE WRONGFULLY CHARGED IN

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:10.369
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED SO I THINK

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:13.071
TO MOVE TO THE COLLECTION OF

00:21:13.138 --> 00:21:15.374
DNA FOR MISDEMEANORS WHEN

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.174
THERE'S A LITTLE CONNECTION

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:19.411
BETWEEN THE- COMMITTING OF SUCH

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:21.046
MISDEMEANORS AND THEN THE

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.180
POSSIBILITY OF COMMITTING

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:24.516
VIOLENT FELONIES. THIS DOES NOT

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:26.551
MAKE SENSE AT THIS POINT SO I

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:30.922
WILL BE VOTING NO ON THIS BILL-

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:33.125

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.168
I DON'T KNOW BUT TO UNICORN

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:45.003
ARGUMENT BUT- I CERTAINLY HAVE

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.138
FRIENDS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:21:46.204 --> 00:21:47.973
INCLUDING MY COUNTY SHERIFF

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.074
IT'S REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT AB

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:51.977
ONE ON NINE PROP 47-57 IN THE

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.311
IMPACTS ON ON THE COUNTY OF

00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:57.783
ORANGE- SO- I DIDN'T COME

00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:01.086
PREPARED FOR A BIG DEBATE BUT-

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:03.555
CERTAINLY. AS A COUNTY

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:04.723
SUPERVISOR AT THE TIME

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.158
CERTAINLY SAW. A LOT OF THINGS

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:08.493
FIRST HAND SO I WOULD-

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.462
APPRECIATE THAT IF I COULD MOVE

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:14.099
THE BILL FOR ABOUT. RIGHT THE

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.967
BILL HAS A MOTION ANY OTHER

00:22:16.034 --> 00:22:18.070

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON ALL

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:29.715
THE AUTHORITY- NO TODAY ON THIS

00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:35.220
MEASURE- ID- YOU KNOW I AND I

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:37.689
UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW I ALSO IN

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:39.758
MY OWN COMMUNITY I THINK PEOPLE

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.226
HAVE A PERCEPTION SAN

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:43.462
FRANCISCO- IS ALWAYS A CERTAIN

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:44.963
WAY BUT YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.734
WANT TO FEEL SAFE- EVERYWHERE-

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.803
AND- SOMETIMES- PEOPLE. I THINK

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.039
THAT SOME OF THESE LAWS ARE

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:54.940
SOMEHOW UNDERMINE INNER CITY

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:56.208
AND I AND I ACTUALLY DON'T

00:22:56.274 --> 00:23:00.045
THINK. THAT THAT IS TRUE AND IN

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:03.415
PARTICULAR I ONE THING I AND I

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:06.218
CURE LAW ENFORCEMENT SAY THAT

00:23:06.284 --> 00:23:06.818
SOMETIMES THAT OKAY THIS. BIRD

00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:12.190
IT. TO ME. AND SO- WE CAN'T DO

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:13.325
ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THAT IS

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:15.627
ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE- LAST I

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:16.161
CHECKED IF SOMETHING IS A

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:17.162
MISDEMEANOR YOU CAN BE ARRESTED

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:19.097
FOR THAT YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.633
AND YOU CAN SPEND SIX OR TWELVE

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.002
MONTHS IN COUNTY JAIL ON IT SO

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.370
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS A

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:27.572
MISDEMEANOR. DOESN'T MEAN YOU

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:28.707
CAN'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

00:23:28.774 --> 00:23:29.207
PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:31.676
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:33.478
BUT HOLDING SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:35.747
FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR DOESN'T MEAN

00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:38.383
YOU HAVE TO DESTROY THEIR LIVES

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.085
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:42.020
CONTINUE TO EXPLODE POPULATION

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:43.889
OVER STATE PRISON SYSTEM. TO

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:46.992
THE POINT WHERE YOU SEE AN CSU

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:49.761
STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO PAY

00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:50.929
TUITION THAT THAT THEY CAN

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:53.732
AFFORD- WERE IF USER YOU KNOW

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:55.901
CHOICES THAT WE MADE- THEY

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:57.769
HAVEN'T BUT DID NOT MOVE WENT

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:59.738
THROUGH ALL THE DECADES OF

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:01.907
ADDING SO MANY NEW STATE

00:24:01.973 --> 00:24:04.776
PRISONS EXPLODED OUR STATE

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:06.478
PRISON POPULATION THAT DID NOT

00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:08.713
MAKE CALIFORNIA A SAFER- BUT IT

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.183
IT UNDERMINE THINGS LIKE THE

00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:13.919
CASE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION-

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:17.189
SO ID- YOU KNOW I WE MUST HOLD

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:17.756
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:19.791
BEHAVIOR BUT WE CAN DO IT IN A

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:21.126
WAY. THAT DOESN'T EXPLODE THE

00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:26.164
PRISM BUDGET- AND DOESN'T TEAR

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:26.731
COMMUNITIES APART I WILL BE

MONEY THAT A PERSON WOULD GET

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:52.236
FROM PAYCHECK WOULD GO TOWARDS

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:54.571
RESTITUTION AND GO TOWARD OTHER

ACTUALLY PUT IN A BANK ACCOUNT

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:01.979

YOU BEHAVE THAT ASIAN THAT

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:54.424

LEVEL. OF BEHAVIOR AND THAT.

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:04.701
NOTION. THAT WE PAY PEOPLE WHAT

CENTS TO THREE DOLLARS I MEAN

ARE BUT I THINK IS A BASIC

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:21.017
PRINCIPLE WE'VE GOT TO START

00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:22.986
RECOGNIZING AS THEY DO IN

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.154
NORWAY THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:25.789
GET OUT OF PRISON. THEIR

HOW NOT TO COME BACK. ONE OF

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:38.969
THE WAYS TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:42.506
HUMAN BEINGS. IT'S WHITE THAT'S

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:43.306

HOPE THAT THAT'S THE

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.678
CONVERSATION WE START HAVING

00:50:48.745 --> 00:50:50.280
RATHER THAN. CONTINUING TO

00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:51.281
PUNISH PEOPLE THEY'VE DONE

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:54.017
THEIR TIME- HOPEFULLY DURING

00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:55.018
THAT PERIOD OF TIME THEY'VE

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:56.286

SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE COST

00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:03.560
OF THESE PRISONS IS JUST

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:05.762
RIDICLOUS. COMPARED TO WHAT WE

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.130
PAY TO EDUCATE CHILDREN AND

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:08.698
KEEP THEM OUT OF PRISON SO. I

00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:12.836
TRAJECTORY AND I THINK THIS IS

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:13.937
A RESOLUTION THAT WILL

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:16.039

00:52:36.019 --> 00:52:37.654
THINK ON SENATOR FROM SANTA

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:40.090
BARBARA CLEARLY- GAVE EXAMPLES

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:42.959
OF HOW THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:45.028
TREAT THEIR INCARCERATED

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:46.796
INDIVIDUALS SO WHY SHOULD WE

00:52:46.863 --> 00:52:48.798
WANT TO FOLLOW THAT MODEL. AS

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:49.900
FAR AS THE BUDGET IT'S ALL

00:52:49.966 --> 00:52:52.002
ABOUT PRIORITIES THIS IS A

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:54.871
BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES A

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:58.375
PRISON LABOR AND JUST FROM.

00:52:58.441 --> 00:52:59.209
LICENSE PLATES AND ALL THE

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:00.010
OTHER STUFF THAT WE BUY IN THIS

00:53:00.076 --> 00:53:01.111
BUILDING ALONE WE COULD AFFORD

00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:03.013
TO PAY ARE IN MAKES FAR MORE

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:03.847
THAN EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR. THANK

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:18.094
YOU. THANK YOU AFTER SO. BEFORE

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:21.498
I ASK FOR THE CLOTHES. I WANTED

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:22.065
TO JUST MAKE THE ADDITIONAL

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:25.001
COMMENT THAT. WELL I FOCUSED ON

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:27.304
CHILDREN I THINK- SENATOR

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:28.872
BRADFORD YOU'RE VERY POINT THAT

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:31.675
THIS THAT HOW THIS SYSTEM WAS

00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:34.878
EVEN ABLE TO EVOLVE WAS THROUGH

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:35.946
THAT- AMENDMENT TO OUR

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:40.617
CONSTITUTION. THAT WHILE IT

00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:43.053
ELIMINATED SLAVERY ALLOWED FOR

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:45.722
SLAVERY WITHIN THOSE PEOPLE

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:46.323
WHOM WE INCARCERATE AND WE ARE

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:50.727
STILL. THIS IS A THIS IS STILL

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:53.797
A REMNANT OF THAT AND I THINK

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:58.001
WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE AS A STATE

00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:58.802
AND I THINK THE SOCIETY AT

00:53:58.868 --> 00:53:59.970
LARGE BUT DEFINITELY WE AS A

00:54:00.036 --> 00:54:02.205
STATE. HAVE BEEN MOVING

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:04.107
CLEARING CLEAR ROAD IS THAT IT

00:54:04.174 --> 00:54:06.743
IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR US TO

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:10.080
RELY ON ANY ONE'S LABOR.

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:11.982
WITHOUT COMPENSATION FOR THAT

00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:13.883
LABOR AND WE MADE A FIRST STEP

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.719
THIS LAST YEAR WITH STUDENT

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:16.853
ATHLETES WHILE WE DO NOT

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.889
GUARANTEE THEM PAY. WE AT LEAST

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:22.025
RECOGNIZED THAT THEY WERE

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:24.260
PRODUCING WEALTH THAT THEY WERE

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:26.262
NOT BEING ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:30.500
AND IN THIS CASE. ARE

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:31.868
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:33.269
PRODUCING WEALTH AND THEY'RE

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:36.072
PRODUCING GOODS FOR THE HOOD

00:54:36.139 --> 00:54:39.009
THE STATE AND MANY OTHERS. AND

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:41.611
THE IRONY IS AND THEN IT'S A

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:44.714
GREAT COST TO THE STATE FOR

00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:45.982
SETTING IT UP THAT WAY BECAUSE

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:49.219
EITHER. THE PERSON OF EITHER

00:54:49.285 --> 00:54:50.654
THEIR RESTITUTION IS NOT BEING

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.921
PAID THEIR CHILDREN ARE NOT

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:53.957
BEING SUPPORTED OR THEY

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:55.692
THEMSELVES COME OUT WITH HUGE

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:58.128
DEBT BECAUSE YOU WHATEVER DATE

00:54:58.194 --> 00:54:58.995
YOU HAD WHEN YOU WALK IN A

00:54:59.062 --> 00:54:59.996
PRISON YOU STILL HAVE WHEN YOU

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:02.365
COME OUT. AND WE JUST

00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:05.101
CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR INABILITY

00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:08.638
TO REALLY BE SUCCESSFUL- SO

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:10.273
IT'S SIX HUGE IS FILE COST WEST

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.809
WE HAVE DESIGNED A STRUCTURE

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:15.679
THAT COSTS US IN ADDITION TO

00:55:15.745 --> 00:55:16.946
NOT PROVIDING ANY DIGNITY THE

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:18.848
PERSON AND VIOLATING THE

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:22.218
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT.

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:27.257
PERSON WHO IS PRODUCING IS.

00:55:27.323 --> 00:55:27.857
PARTICIPATING LABOR SHOULD BE

00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:28.892
COMPENSATED FOR THAT LABOR SO

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:31.695
I- I WELCOME THIS CONVERSATION

00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:35.131
AND AS I SAID I'M VERY VERY.

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:35.765
PLEASED IF YOU'RE WILLING TO BE

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.000
A STRONG COLLECTOR YES. YES

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:40.103
SENATOR MOORLACH. JUSTIN

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:45.075
ACCOUNTING QUESTION. HE USED TO

00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:46.109
BE A TREASURER OF A SUMMER CAMP

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:48.378
SO WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE.

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:51.614
PACKAGE PAPER WORK BUT YOU ALSO

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:54.084
HAD HOUSING AND MEALS. AND I'M

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.819
JUST WONDERING HOW HOW DOES

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:57.187
HOUSING AND MEALS FIT INTO THE

00:55:57.253 --> 00:55:59.189
EQUATION AND WITH THAT BE PART

00:55:59.255 --> 00:56:02.225
OF THE FACTOR OF WHY. THE

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.594
HOURLY RATES ARE SO LOW IN THE

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:05.195
COUNTRY BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO

00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:11.034
FIGURE OUT THE HISTORY OF IT.

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:11.668
BUT A THING SENATOR BERNIE AND

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:14.104
MAY MENTION THE HISTORY.

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:14.904
EARLIER WHICH IT GOES ALL THE

00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:17.340
WAY BACK TO THE- MATH MASON

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:18.708
POCKET WE'RE SITTING IN THE

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:21.711
REPORT THAT THAT EVEN THE WAGES

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:22.879
HAVE GONE DOWN SINCE TWO

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:27.150
THOUSAND ONE SO I'M I'M. BY THE

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:28.118
WAY TO THE BOND ALLEN IS WILL

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:28.785
WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:29.786
BECAUSE MOST OF THE SERVICES

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:30.620
THAT HAVE GONE DOWN FOR

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:32.388
PRISONERS IN CALIFORNIA PRISON.

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:34.324
IN IN THE IN CDC HAVE GONE DOWN

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.658
AS WELL A MAJORITY OF THE

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:37.327
BUDGET WHICH IS QUITE LARGE AS

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:39.896
YOU ALL KNOW. GOES TO STAFF AND

00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:41.464
SERVICES IN THE UNION XIN IS AN

00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:42.932
OLDER ENGINES IN THE UNION HAS

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:45.034
BECOME VERY STRONG THE LAST

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:45.969
THIRTY YEARS. AND THEY'VE

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:47.737
CREATED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:49.072
WEALTH OFF THE BACK TO THE

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:49.739
PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED FROM THAT

00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:50.774
IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INSIDE

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.442
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO PRISON.

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:53.910
EVERYBODY HAD SOME TYPE OF PAIN

00:56:53.977 --> 00:56:54.878
NUMBER WERE YOU WOULD

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:55.879
COMPENSATE EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT

00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:57.680
THAT YOU. THE THAT THEY HAVE

00:56:57.747 --> 00:57:00.216
NOW NOW VIRTUALLY NOBODY GETS

00:57:00.283 --> 00:57:02.185
COMPENSATED THIS IS LIKE A

00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:02.819
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:04.053
PRISON AND ACTUALLY GET PAID

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.688
EVEN AT THE TEN CENTER TWENTY

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:07.624
CENTS. AN HOUR- TYPE OF LABOR

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.359
WAITED SO THE SERVICE IN COPLEY

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:12.562
GONE DOWN FOR US IN REFERENCE

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:13.863
TO REHABILITATION SERVICES JOBS

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.565
PAY X. THAT ARE. OUT ON THE

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:18.101
OTHER SIDE THE STAFF- MY GONE

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:21.104
UP SO THERE'S A BIG IMBALANCE

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:22.939
BETWEEN ACTUALLY WHAT IS BEING

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:24.007
DELIVERED TO US AND FORMER

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.642
SERVICES. FIRST ACTING TO- THE

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:29.479
ADMINISTRATION SEES ITSELF- BUT

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:30.513
THE HISTORY I MEAN THAT'S

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.114
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF START WITH

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:32.348
THE BILL COLIN TO BE ABLE TO-

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:33.516
FIND A PERSON CONVICTED OF A

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:34.284
CRIME THEN LEASING THEM OUT

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:36.853
FOR. A SLAVE LABOR SO TO SPEAK

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.521
IN SMALL WAGES- AND IT'S

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:40.824
CONTINUE ON. TO THE ENACTMENT

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.025
THIRTEEN THE MEMBER OF PEOPLE

00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:44.027
TO. ACTUALLY PUT IS INVOLUNTARY

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:48.631
SERVITUDE. BECAUSE WE'VE

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:49.232
COMMITTED A CRIME AND WE THINK

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:57.841
THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY. THE

00:57:57.907 --> 00:57:59.375
VISIT SOMETIME SOON- AND NOW

00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:01.544
THE COLORADO LEAD. IN

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:02.111
INNOVATION IN THIS AREA MORE

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:07.417
THAN CALIFORNIA. CENTER THANK

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:09.085
YOU FOR GROWTH YOU KNOW THANKS

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:09.919
FOR LETTING ME JUST TESTS AND

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.821
QUIZZES AS A COMEDIAN

00:58:11.888 --> 00:58:13.456
APPRECIATED RIGHT AND IF YOU

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:14.057
WOULD LIKE TO ASK WHEN YOU DO

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:15.859
SO FINE I OTHERWISE I WAS GOING

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:17.026
TO GO TO SENATOR MITCHELL

00:58:17.093 --> 00:58:18.461
RESULTING FOR OKAY GREAT CENTER

00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:19.696
MITCHELL. I WAS JUST GONNA

00:58:19.762 --> 00:58:20.330
REPLY ALSO TO OUR COLLEAGUES

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:21.898
QUESTION I AND I GET THE LOGIC

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:23.299
OF THE CORRELATIONS THAT WE

00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:25.668
CHARGE PEOPLE FOR SOME OF THE

00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:26.736
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:28.204
INCARCERATING THEM AND THAT

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:34.878
WASN'T THE DESIGN. IN IT. GOES

00:58:34.944 --> 00:58:36.546
BACK TO THE CHAIN GANGS THAT

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:37.714
THERE IS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.983
AND I AM OPEN TO BE CORRECTED

00:58:40.049 --> 00:58:42.452
THERE IS NO CORRELATION WE

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.520
DON'T DRAW DOWN ANY OF THEIR

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:46.789
SALARY RE DIRECTED TO- COVERING

00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:49.893
THEIR EXPENSES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:51.628
FOR JUVENILES WHERE WE ACTUALLY

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:54.330
CHARGE FEES ARE USED TO BEFORE

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:57.200
BILL PASSED ON TO THEM TO COVER

00:58:57.267 --> 00:58:59.435
THEIR INCARCERATION THE PAYMENT

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:02.205
IS NOT A CORRELATION AT ALL- IT

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:03.840
IT AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:05.942
THE COST THAT WOULD BE BORN IN

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:07.210
INCREASING THE PAYMENT WOULD

00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:10.380
COME OUT OF THE PROFIT EARNED

00:59:10.446 --> 00:59:11.915
BY DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:14.450
FOR FAILING FURNITURE TO THE

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:17.720
STATE OF THE GRAVITY THE LENSES

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:20.690
FOR MEDI CAL FOR GLASSES. THERE

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:23.293
IS A PROFIT EARNED OFF OF- THAT

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:25.795
THAT LABOR AND THERE HAS NEVER

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:27.730
BEEN A CORRELATION BETWEEN

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:30.733
INMATE EARNINGS PAIN AGAINST

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.001
THEIR EXPENSES FOR BEING

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:33.937
INCARCERATED THAT WAS NEVER THE

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:36.973
DESIGN I THINK THAT FOR ME THAT

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.009
THAT'S THE RUB THAT IT'S NOT AS

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:41.978
IF THEY ARE PAYING FOR THEIR

00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:44.914
BOARD A IT KEEP IF YOU WILL. IT

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:47.884
IS A PROFIT POINT. AND THEREIN

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:48.518
LIES THE INAPPROPRIATENESS FROM

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:49.185
MY PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU MADAM

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:53.923
CHAIR. CENTER BRADFORD UNIT

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:55.124
CLOSE I THINK WE CAN GIVE YOU

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:56.726
THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSER I THINK-

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:58.928
DISCUSSIONS BEEN A GREAT CLOSER

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:01.564
AND I WAS ASKED EARLIER WHY IS

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:04.100
THIS RESOLUTION AND I WAS

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:06.569
HESITANT TO A RESOLUTION I

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.871
WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A BILL BUT

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:10.006
WE UNDERSTAND JUST ON SOME

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:12.709
DISCUSSION WE HEARD I THINK

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.677
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP AND I

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:15.878
THINK THE DIALOGUE IN THE
