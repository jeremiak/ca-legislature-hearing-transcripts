GONNA GET GOING HERE THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE THAT TODAY. IS A DAY WILL TALK ABOUT ARCADE TWELVE SCHOOLS TO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AT PRIMARILY FOCUSING ON THE LC FF A FUNDING FORMULA. AND TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. THIS WAS ISSUE TOO WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A FEW ELSE IF THAT PROPOSAL'S FRIEND. COMMITTEE MEMBERS MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE AND DOWN. AND THAT THE PUBLIC AS WELL. AS AS WELL ISSUE NUMBER THREE WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT OUR STATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. SO SO WITH THAT WOULD START WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE. THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET. WE HAVE DEPARTMENT HAVE. ABOUT FINANCE ELIO THE CURRENT EDUCATION OUR FIRST PANEL AND OUR SECOND PANEL WE HAVE AYE PRACTITIONERS FROM. DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THEY CAN TALK ABOUT. WHAT ELSE THE FF LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUNDS? SIX YEARS LATER. SO WITH THAT WE WILL ON THAT BEGIN WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS NARRATIVE US DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GONNA PRESENT YOU JUST WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR. ELSE IF F. PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THAT SOME CONTACTS AS WELL OF THAT THE. FUNDING FORMULA. AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF ABOUT TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE LOCAL TROLL FUNDING FORMULA. THAT GETS US TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION. TWO YEARS AHEAD OF THE ORIGINAL SCHEDULE AND PUTS TOLD US IF A FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR JUST ABOVE SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS. AND IT BRINGS A TOTAL OF NEW ONGOING FUNDING THAT SCHOOLS RECEIVE A SENSE TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. AS PART OF ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT PROPOSAL TO FULLY FUND THE LC FF IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE MINISTRATION PROPOSES TO APPROPRIATE THE REMAINING GAP FUNDING AS A PERCENTAGE INSTEAD OF A FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT. USING A PERCENTAGE TO CLOSE THE REMAINING GAP PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS. WANTED ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO CALCULATE A PORTION IS PRECISELY AT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TARGET LEVELS FOR EACH ELIA. WHICH PREVENTS OVER OR UNDER FUNDING OF THE LC FF NUMBER TWO IT PROVIDES ELEAZAR AT THAT LEVEL OF CERTAINTY WHEN PROVIDING THEY'RE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGETS THIS COMING SUMMER. BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW THE EXACT AMOUNT THAT THEY CAN EXPECT TO RECEIVE AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RATHER THAN THEIR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF SOME FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE STATEMENT. AND THREE IT REDUCES WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BY ELIMINATING MUCH OF THE ITERATIVE PROCESS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO APPROPRIATE A FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT LIKE I MENTIONED. THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER DOES NOT AFFECT ANY ABILITY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE TO AUGMENT THE LC FF IN EXCESS OF THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION AMOUNT THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. CURRENTLY. UNDER THE LCF HALF OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH STUDENT POPULATIONS OF HIGH NEED AS DETERMINED BY PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR FREE INTRODUCED PRICED LUNCH FOSTER YOUTH. OR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS A BIRTHDAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE FORM OF SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANTS IN ADDITION TO THEIR PER EIGHTY A SPACECRAFT AMOUNTS. PRE LCF. FUNDING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH ALLOCATED BASED ON HISTORICALLY SET REVENUE LIMITS IN PARTICIPATION IN CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. WITH LIMITED FLEXIBILITY HOW FUNDS WERE ACTUALLY SPENT IN MOST DISTRICTS OPERATE WITH A HEAVILY COMPLIANCE ORIENTED MINDSET. WITH THE PASSAGE OF LC FF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALL THEIR REVENUE LIMIT FUNDING AND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR CATEGORICAL FUNDING ROLLED INTO THEIR OUT OF ENTITLEMENT AS A FLOOR. WITH THE STATE APPROPRIATING GOT FUNDING OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS TAB EVERYONE REACH THEIR TARGET LEVEL OF FUNDING UNDER THEY'LL CFF SIMILARLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF ELSE IF OF. COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ALSO RECEIVED AN OUNCE IF A FORMULA THAT OPERATE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND CHARTER SCHOOL FORMULA. WITH ADDITIONAL WEIGHT GIVEN TO STUDENTS OF HIGH NEED. ADDITIONALLY COUNTY OFFICES RECEIVE FUNDING BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHIN THEIR COUNTY AND THE OVERALL COUNTY WHITE ATA IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR COUNTY WIDE SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE OVERSIGHT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESPONSIBILITIES. COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED ONTO THEIR ELSE IF OF TARGET AMOUNT SINCE THE FOURTEENTH FIFTEEN YEAR. AND THEIR ANNUAL KINDA MINUTES APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. NOW THAT SCHOOL THIS RECEIVE ALMOST ALL THEIR FUNDING THROUGH THE LC FF THEY HAVE UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF DISCRETION TO BEST ADDRESS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS ALONG WITH REQUIREMENTS PROMOTE LOCAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. AND INVOLVEMENT WITH IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS AS PART OF THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS ARE EL CAPS. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENT SEE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND COMMUNITY. ENGAGEMENT. IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MORE MEANINGFUL AND EFFECTIVE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES REQUIRING ELEAZAR. THROUGH A BUDGET CROSSWALK DOCUMENT TO SHOW HOW THEIR BUDGET EXPENDITURES ALIGNED WITH THE STRATEGIES DETAILED IN THEIR EL CAPS FOR SERVING STUDENTS GENERATING SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANTS. THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES THAT THE CITY MAKE AVAILABLE ON A SINGLE WEBSITE. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING PROVIDED TO EACH ELLIOTT UNDER THE ELSE HERE TOUGH. THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS ALONE IN ISOLATION RATHER IT IS VIEWED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AS PART OF THE LARGER EFFORT TO IMPROVE. COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN SCHOOL DISTRICT DECISION MAKING IT AND CAPACITY BUILDING THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGH THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM SUPPORT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES STUDENTS. MY COLLEAGUES ON THE LAST PANEL TODAY YOU CAN JUST ABOUT THE STATEWIDE SPAT. SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WILL BE ABLE DISCUSS THAT STRUCTURE IN OUR INTENT AS WELL IN GREATER DETAIL. I WITHOUT OUR CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU ELIA. GOOD MORNING RUN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL BE SPEAKING THIS MORNING FROM A HANDOUT THAT WAS JUST PASSED OUT TO YOU. BUT SO WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S FOR FISCAL PROPOSALS REGARDING LCF OF BUT WE DO THINK THAT THIS. MELISSA MOMENT OF. POTENTIALLY ACHIEVING FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LC A FIVE. OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT WAS THIS POLICY CHANGE THAT WE MADE IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN ONE FAX HAS IT HAD ON SCHOOL FINANCE? AND WHAT CHANGES CAN WE MAKE GOING FORWARD. ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THIS HANDOUT WE TALK ABOUT THE MOST BASIC ELEMENTS OF LC FF WHICH IS THE. A BASED GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING THAT'S OFFERED TO EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT ACCORDING TO THESE FOUR DIFFERENT GRADE SPEND CATEGORIES. AND THE CENTRAL QUESTION HERE IS. NOW THAT WE'RE REACHING FULL IMPLEMENTATION OR REACHING THE STATUTORY. BASEBAND RATES. WHAT ARE THESE RATES HOW WHERE THEY SAID? BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE STEPS THAT WERE TAKEN AT THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIRST WE STARTED WITH WHAT WERE. OF THE AVERAGE GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING AMOUNTS PROVIDED FOR EACH OF THESE GRADES SPANS. THEY AND THE PRE RECESSION ERA SO WE RESTORED THE CUTS THAT WERE MADE DURING THE RECESSION WE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. THAT WAS OUR STARTING POINT. I TO WE ADJUSTED EACH OF THOSE UPWARDS BY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. ESTO BROWN NUMBER. AND THEN THREE WE MADE ADDITIONAL UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO TO AT THE BASE RATES TO THE K. THREE BASE RATE AND TO THE HIGH SCHOOL BATES RATE THOSE VERSES FOR SPECIFIC POLICY PURPOSES. IT WAS TO SUPPORT CLASS SIZE REDUCTION IN THE EARLIER GRADES INTO SUPPORT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN HIGH SCHOOL. NOW THIS IS ALL THE SAY THAT. WHEN ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT ARE THESE BASE RATES HOW WERE THEY SAID. THAT IT WAS A VERY AD HOC PROCESS IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT THE STATE'S FINAL ANSWER ON THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVEL. FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS THESE WERE MODERATELY AMBITIOUS TARGETS AND NOW THAT WE'VE REACHED THEM WE HAVE TO REVISIT THE QUESTION OF. OF WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING LA AMOUNT TO WHAT IS THE PURPOSE VERSUS TARGETED FUNDING. DOWN THE TARGETED FUNDING QUESTION WE WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT ON THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. AND THAT'S THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANTS IN MANY WAYS THESE WERE LCF APPS PROPOSED SUCCESSOR TO THE CATEGORICAL FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED. UNDER THE PREVIOUS FINANCE SYSTEM BUT THEY DIFFER FROM THAT CATEGORICAL FUNDING IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. BUT THE FIRST IS THAT IT'S NOTABLY LARGER THAN THE CATEGORICAL FUNDING THAT WAS ROLLED AND IF IF YOU TAKE ALL OF A CAN CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT WERE ROLLED INTEL CFF. YOU JUST THAT FUNDING FOR INFLATION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE LESS THAN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ROLLED IN. A THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANTS IS A LITTLE OVER NINE BILLION DOLLARS. AT A SECOND WAVE DIFFERENCES IT'S MUCH MORE TARGETED A SCHOOLS COULD RECEIVE CATEGORICAL FUNDING FOR A NUMBER. OF REASONS UNDER THE PREVIOUS. SCHOOL FINANCE SYSTEM BUT UNDER LC FF THEY CAN ONLY RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING. FOR THE SPECIFIC STERN POPULATIONS THAT THEY SERVE SO ONLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE SERVING. OF LOW INCOME OR ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS. RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING IN ONLY AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT SERVE AN AWFUL LOT OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING. NO THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T SERVE THOSE STUDENTS WERE COMPLETELY LEFT IN THE COLD UNDER LC FF. AS WE DESCRIBED ON PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT LC FF DID INCLUDE A NUMBER OF. ADD ON PROGRAMS THAT THE DIRECT SOME FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WERE RECEIVING MORE FUNDING UNDER THE PREVIOUS FINANCE SYSTEM THAN THEY WOULD. UNDER THE BASIC BASED SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION FORMULA UNDER LC FF. BUT IT IS TO SAY THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING LCF EFFORTS MUCH MORE TARGETED TOWARDS DISTRICTS THAT SERVE LOW INCOME ENGLISH HONORS STUDENTS. NOW CONSEQUENTLY AS WE SHOWN ON PAGE FOUR. SPENDING DIFFERENCE FOR THOSE HIGH POVERTY DIFFERENT THAT DISTRICTS IS NOTABLY LARGER NOW THAN IT WAS UNDER THE OLD FINANCE SYSTEM. NOW EVEN UNDER THE OLD FINANCE SYSTEM. HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS IN IN HERE WE'RE DESCRIBING HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS AS THOSE DISTRICTS THAT SERVE MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT ENGLISH SIREN LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AND THEY SPEND ABOUT FOURTEEN PERCENT MORE THAN NO POVERTY DISTRICTS. WELL THAT'S GROWN UP SIGNIFICANTLY TO ABOVE TWENTY THREE PERCENT AT THAT STARTING PLACE REFLECTS THE FACT THAT WAS SOME TARGETING UNDER THE PREVIOUS FINANCE SYSTEM BUT. THEY'RE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TARGETING NOW. THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT. HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS SPEND A LOT MORE THAN THE POVERTY DISTRICTS WE DO FIND EH AS WE. POINT ON ON PAGE FIVE THAT THEIR BASE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE SOMEWHAT POORER THAN THOSE THAT ARE OFFERED BY LOW POVERTY DISTRICTS. IN PARTICULAR IF YOU LOOK AT CLASS SIZES THOSE TEND TO BE LARGER. IN YOUR HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS IF YOU LOOK AT TEACHER PAY ATTENTION BE LOWER IN YEAR HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS. NOW THAT THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE COUNTERINTUITIVE MOST OF WHAT SCHOOL SPENDING THEIR GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING ON IT IS TEACHERS SALARIES CITY. YES A QUESTION IF A DISTRICT IS RECEIVING. TWENTY PERCENT MORE THAN ANOTHER DISTRICT BUT THEY'RE PAYING THEIR TEACHERS LESSEN THEIR HIRING FEWER TEACHERS HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN THE ANSWER IS THAT. THESE HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS ARE SPENDING AN AWFUL LOT OF THEIR BUDGETS AND SERVICES THAT LOW POVERTY DISTRICTS EITHER DO NOT OFFER OR DO NOT OFFER TO THE SAME EXTENT. LASER A TRUANCY PREVENTION PROGRAMS. AT SCHOOL SECURITY SCHOOL HEALTH AT THESE PROGRAMS. TAKE A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH CHUNK OUT OF THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUDGETS THAT THEY HAVE LAST. LEFT OVER FOR THEIR BASE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. NOW THIS IS ALL IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR ONE OF THE BIG POLICY QUESTIONS WITH US IF IF THAT'S WHAT WE ADDRESS IN. THE SIXTH AND FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. A THE LC FIVE WAS INTENDED IN PART TO ADDRESS A VERY SPECIFIC LONG STANDING UP AT ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER STATES WHICH IS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN LOW INCOME AND NON LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WELL UNFORTUNATELY THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AS MEASURED BY STATE A. STATEWIDE STANDARD ASSESSMENTS AS NOT BUDGE NOTABLY UNDER LC FF WOULD WE HAVE A FEW YEARS NOW INTO THE STATE'S NEW STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS. IT WHILE WE'VE SEEN SOME OVERALL IMPROVEMENTS ON A STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT ON THOSE TESTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOW INCOME AND NON LOW INCOME STUDENTS. IS NOT CHANGE NOTABLY OVER THOSE YEARS IN ADDITION THE. FEDERAL. NAPES RESULTS AS WELL AS WE CALL THEM. WHICH ARE AYE AYES SAMPLE OF ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE GIVEN. EVERY COUPLE YEARS THEY THEY INDICATE THAT. IT OVER THE SPAN. STARTING FROM JUST BEFORE EL CFF TO A FEW YEARS INTO ELSEY FF'S IMPLEMENTATION WILL AGAIN CALIFORNIA'S NOT NOTABLY CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO. WHAT CHANGES COULD BE MADE TO SCHOOL FINANCE TO FURTHER ADDRESS? AND IN ADDITION. THERE OUR LONGSTANDING ISSUES ABOUT THE. APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED ALL DISTRICTS TO COVER RAISING COSTS SUCH AS SCHOOL PENSIONS. THOSE ARE ALL QUESTIONS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND THIS IN COMING YEARS OF BEFORE I I PASS ON I. DO WANNA. DISCUSS THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S ALSO ABOUT PROPOSAL WITCHES THE TRANSPARENCY THEY. AS FINANCE INDICATED HAVE A GRIP PROPOSED. ADDING AN ADDENDUM TO DISTRICT BUDGETS THAT WOULD OFFER SOME CROSSWALK BETWEEN. THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN THOSE BUDGETS AND THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN THE HELL CAPS WERE WE'RE RECOMMENDING REJECTING THAT PROPOSAL. WE UNDERSTAND TRANSPARENCY IS A CONCERN. A WITH THE EXPENDITURE OF SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDS THOUGH WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS. PARTICULAR PROPOSALS WELL TARGETED TOWARDS THOSE CONCERNS GOOD MOSTLY DUPLICATE INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE ON ALL CAPS. IT WOULD PUT IT IN A THE BUDGET BUT THE BUDGET IS NOT REALLY A DOCUMENT THAT'S DESIGNED FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION IT'S ALREADY A LONG AND COMPLICATED. A PROCESS WHICH WE THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE TRANSPARENCY CONCERNS WOULD WE WOULD RECOMMEND. A FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THE EL CAP AND SIMPLIFYING BE EL CAP. BUT THAT'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS THANK. THANK YOU BEFORE YOU DO THAT WE DO OUR OUR ROLE REAL QUICK. IT'S MCCARTY HERE. CHAVEZ HERE AMONG. MEDINA HERE MESSAGING THERE O'DONNELL. VOEPEL. THANK YOU BERMAN IF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING DEBORAH VENABLE HAVE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION I JUST MAKE A FEW ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND BUILDING UPON WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID AROUND AT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LC FF AND AND JUST TO KNOW THAT THAT. SUPERINTENDENT IS PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MAINTAINING THE COMMITMENT TO FULLY FUNDING LCF OFTEN THAT WHERE AT DOING% THAT EARLY NAY NO WILL TALK ABOUT IT LATER. IN THAT IN THE NEXT. ISSUE AROUND THE NEED TO AYE BUT WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A STRONG NEED TO PUT MORE FUNDING TOWARDS. US SCHOOLS AND LCF MATHIS WE THINK ABOUT WHAT ELSE IT WHAT FULL FUNDING MEANS WHICH MEANS THAT WE'VE RESTORED. ARE FUNDING LEVELS BACK TO SIXTY THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT FUNDING LEVELS ADJUSTED FOR COST OF LIVING SO SO AM AS MISTER ANDERSON SAID IT YOU KNOW. WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE I'M MORE INVESTMENTS IN OUR SCHOOLS IS THAT WAS NOT? SORT OF THAT THAT THE GOAL IS TO WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND. AND AND IT'S WHAT HE'S IT MISTER ANDERSON ALSO TALKED ABOUT SORT OF THAT WITH THAT WERE STILL CONTINUING TO SEE. AT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND SOME AND AND THERE'D THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE ELSE IF THAT'S AND THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN THE COURSE THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE. A GROWTH IN THAT AND I THINK THE ONLY THING I WOULD JUST ADD WHAT. AROUND THE AB PROPOSAL TO AND I HAVE THE DEPARTMENT POSTED THE AS SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANTS WITHIN THREE DAYS OF THEM BEING AVAILABLE WHICH IS JUST TO SAY THAT WE SAID WE SUPPORT THAT PROPOSAL. AND THAT WRITTEN THAT IT IS AYE CODIFYING IN EXISTING PRACTICE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO TO MAINE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION ON THAT ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE SO WE WE SUPPORT THAT. INCREASE TRANSPARENCY THINKING. THANK YOU. WE HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THIS. PANEL BEFORE HERE FROM OUR SUPERINTENDENTS CUSTOMERS WHO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE YOU ON. WE LIKE TO START WITH THE THE ALEJO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I. NOT ONLY. APPRECIATE IN THE HANDOUT THAT YOU. PROVIDED TODAY BUT ALSO YEAR PROP NINETY EIGHT EDUCATION ANNOUNCES. AND. I KNOW TO. THAT. ON PAGE TWENTY SIX OF YOUR. PROP NINETY EIGHT ANALYSIS. YOU TALK ABOUT. THE OPTIONS FOR LESS THAT CONSIDERATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING TODAY. NOW IN TERMS OF. K. THROUGH TWELVE. FINDING AND. FIRST IN YOUR ANALYSIS YOU'D DISCUSS THE. PROPOSAL FOR THE INCREASE BASE RATES. THAT WOULD HELP ALL DISTRICTS ON MULTIPLE FRONTS. COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT TO. THE EARS SO THEY IN MANY WAYS THIS WOULD BE THE SIMPLEST OPTION WHICH WOULD BE TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF THE LCF A FORMULA WHICH IS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS PROVIDED THROUGH THAT FORMULA. SO GENERALLY SPEAKING THIS IN THIS MEANS YOU WOULD INCREASE THE BASE RATES. I'D AS YOU INCREASE THE BASE RATES YOU WOULD INCREASE FUNDING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANTS MRS BECAUSE THOSE. FUNDING AMOUNTS OUR ARE SIMPLY A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE BASE RATES ARE THE GENERAL RULE OF THUMB THAT WE PRESENT THERE IS THAT FOR. EACH A ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE BASE RATES EAT YOU WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT A STATEWIDE COST OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION WOULD GO TOWARDS THAT TARGETED FUNDING FOR LOW INCOME AND ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS. OKAY YEAH THANK YOU AYE. THE CHAIR JUST POINTED OUT TO ME THAT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE. FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE SUBJECT INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM. YOURSELF AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SO I RESERVE. MY QUESTIONS FOR THE NEXT PANEL OKAY THANK YOU WITH THAT. LET'S I BRING. OUR REPRESENTS FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE HAVE. OUR NEW SUPERINTENDENT FROM THE SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT EXCITED TO WELCOME MAT THAT SUPERINTENDENT HORRY I YOU ARE FIRST TIME TO. SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT FROM THE TORRANCE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. DOCTOR TENSED UP. START WITH YOU. I CAN'T FIGURE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JORGE YOU LIED AS. THE CHAIRMAN CHEN DIE AND. TEN MONTHS INTO MY TENURE AS SECOND IN A CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT AND VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE. I WANNA AND TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF. WHETHER AT THE LC FF BASED GRANT A SUFFICIENTLY COVERS ALL OF THE INCREASED COSTS THAT DISTRICTS SUCH AS MINE ARE FACING. A INCLUDING PENSION COSTS. AND CERTAINLY WHILE OUR DISTRICT VERY MUCH APPRECIATES THE INCREASES IN FUNDING FROM LC FF INCLUDING THE ADVANCE PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE ELSE IF IF BASS GRANT WILL NOT ADEQUATELY COVER THE INCREASED COSTS THAT WE ARE FACING. ACCORDING TO OUR CBO'S CALCULATIONS AFTER PERSON STIRS COST ARE DEDUCTED FROM LC FF. A WE WILL BE LEFT WITH EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE RECEIVE FROM AL CFF. AND THIS IS A DOWNWARD TREND OF FOR US IN SUCCEEDING ARE ARE CAL STIRS PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATES WILL MORE THAN DOUBLE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE ARE GOING FROM EIGHT POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT TO NINETEEN POINT NINE PERCENT. THE TOTAL OF OUR PER STIRS CONTRIBUTIONS WENT FROM THIRTEEN MILLION. I JUST OVER THIRTEEN MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. TO OVER THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND ALTHOUGH WE HAVE RECEIVED MORE LCF IF FUNDING EVERY YEAR THE AMOUNT WE ARE RECEIVING FROM L. CFF IS NOT KEEPING PACE WITH THE INCREASES IN OUR PENSION CONTRIBUTION. I YES WE ARE RECEIVING MORE MONEY FROM THE STATE OUR BUT AFTER WE MAKE OUR PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS WE HAVE LESS TO WORK WITH. A AND THE TREND IS THAT EVERY YEAR WE HAVE LESS AND LESS TO WORK WITH. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN FISCAL YEAR WE HAD ABOUT NINETY THREE PERCENT NINETY THREE PERCENT OF OUR LCF IF FUNDS LEFT TO SPEND. AFTER SUBTRACTING ARE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. FISCAL YEAR THAT AMOUNT WAS REDUCED TO ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR BUDGET LEFT TO SPEND AFTER SEPT TO IDENTIFY THE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED WHERE WE NEED TO DEDICATE RESOURCES AND IS NECESSARY. INSECTS CITY WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS I'D THESE SHORTAGES BY LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AT HOW WE BUDGET. OUR IN OUR DISTRICT ARE THROUGH THE USE OF WHAT WE'RE CALLING EQUITY INDICES. I WE'VE BEGUN TO TEST A THESE EQUITY INDICES AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU ARE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE'RE. SEEKING TO ACCOMPLISH I IN THE AREA OF STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES. OBVIOUSLY IN MANY URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE OURS AND SEXY THAT WERE IN GREAT NEED OF STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES. ID SUPPORTS INCLUDE COUNSELORS NURSES SOCIAL WORKERS SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. BUT WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR DISTRICT IS THAT DESPITE INCREASED LCF IF FUNDING WE STILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE ALLOCATED FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET FOR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS. HOWEVER THAT INVESTMENT IS STILL APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR SHORT OF WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO MEET THE STAFFING RATIOS RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS. WE ALSO HAVE ABOUT FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT SHORTAGE TO MEET THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL NURSES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NURSING TO STUDENTS STAFFING RATIOS. AND A TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL TO MEET THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS. TO STUDENTS STAFFING RATIOS. AGAIN WE APPRECIATE IMMENSELY ALSEA FF AND THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IT HAS PROVIDED AND HOPE THAT I'LL SEE IF IF WILL CONTINUE TO YIELD MORE RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN. BE ABLE TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND BE ABLE TO INVEST MORE IN CRITICAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS. THAT ARE ESSENTIAL IN HELPING OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO LEARN. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. A. CHAIR MCCARTY. VICE CHAIR CHAVEZ AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. A SUB COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF TOWARDS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. NOT JUST AS A. AS THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT AND FORMER CHIEF ACADEMIC OFFICER BUT ALSO A PARENT NOT SCHOOL DISTRICT. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR FULLY FUNDING OF THE LC FF IN THE PROPOSED EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. I THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. YOU KNOW THAT THE FORMULA. BUT THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE FORMULA ARE BASED ARE SOLID. ARE HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THAT THERE'S A FLAW THAT DOESN'T. INCLUDE ENOUGH SPACE FUNDING TO ADDRESS BASIC NEEDS OF OUR SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY JUST ONE YEAR AFTER THE L. CFF WAS ADOPTED. I AM GLAD TO SEE THE COMMITTEE DOES GOING TO DISCUSS THAT HERE OUT TODAY IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION. THE TORCH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SERVES OVER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS IN OUR THIRTY SCHOOLS EACH AND EVERYDAY. WE OPERATE A SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL AN ADULT TRANSITION PROGRAM AND THREE ADULT EDUCATION CAMPUSES THAT ARE SELF SUSTAINING. WE ARE DIVERSE COMMUNITY IN MANY WAYS OUR STUDENTS SPEAK SEVENTY SIX DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. AND WE HAVE AN UNDUE PICKET A POPULATION OF A THIRTY SIX PERCENT. IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LCF OFF. OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM HAS GONE THROUGH A TRANSPARENT PROCESS INVOLVING ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. THE PROCESS HAS BEEN COLLABORATIVE. AND IS MAXIMIZING THE USE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE TO IMPROVE AND INCREASE SERVICES FOR THESE TARGETED STUDENTS. WE'RE FOLLOWING THE INTENT OF THE LAW AND RESISTING PRESSURES FROM SOME GROUPS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE REQUESTING TO USE A SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR BASS GRANT EXPENDITURES. FOR EXAMPLE ACROSS THE BOARD SALARY ENHANCEMENTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE INTENT OF THE LCF OFF NOR DO WE BELIEVE THAT IT DIRECTS THE RESOURCES TO THE STUDENTS THAT GENERATE THOSE THOSE FUNDS. IN ADDITION TO OUR USE. OUR BELIEF ON THE USE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT FUNDS. WE ARE PROUD OF THE WAY IN WHICH WE'VE UTILIZED THE ONE TIME FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO US EACH OF THE PAST FOUR YEARS. ONE SUCH HIGHLIGHT OCCURRED THIS PAST DECEMBER. WHEN ED SOURCE FEATURED TORRENT UNIFIED'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS. THIS COMPREHENSIVE TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM WAS PRIMARILY FUNDED FROM ONE TIME DOLLARS AND ASSISTED OVER FIVE HUNDRED TEACHERS AND THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IN LEARNING AND WORKING WITH THESE NEW STANDARDS. UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER. WE WE HAVE RECENTLY HAD TO USE ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ONGOING EXPENSES BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THE DOLLARS IN THE BASE GRANT. STEPPED SUPPORT AND STUFF STAN. BOB PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE BUILT AS OTHER OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN PUT UPON US. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A BUDGETING BEST PRACTICE. TO USE ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ON GOING NEEDS BUT WE HAVE LITTLE CHOICE. FOR EXAMPLE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PROPOSED BUDGET. FULL FUNDING OF THE LC FF WE WILL HAVE VERY FEW IF ANY NEW DOLLARS LEFT AFTER ADDRESSING STIRS AND PURRS. STEPPING COLUMN INCREASES AND INCREASING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. OF THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS STARTING WITH SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. WHICH WE WILL ACHED AT SEA AND INCREASE UNDER THE. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FIVE POINT SIX MILLION WILL BE USED TO COVER STIRRED SPURS. AND STEPPING CALL. THAT LEAVES ONLY ONE MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN ONE PER ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF OUR BUDGET. TO ADDRESS THE OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS SPECIAL EDUCATION UTILITIES AND UPGRADING TECHNOLOGY. THE PICTURE FOR NINETEEN TWENTY IS MORE BLEAK. UNDER THE ALL CFF WE ARE ONLY EXPECTED TO RECEIVE A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OF TWO POINT FOUR ONE PERCENT. OR THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. IF THAT IS THE CASE WE WILL NEED NEARLY TWO MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS JUST TO TREAD WATER. AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR ONLY STIRS AND PURRS AND STEPPING CALL. IN A DISTRICT WHERE ALMOST NINETY ONE PERCENT OF OUR BUDGET GOES TO PERSONNEL. THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE UP FOR THESE KINDS OF DEFICITS IS TO CUT PEOPLE. AND HAVING BEEN PART OF THE TEAM TO MAKE WRITTEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION I CAN TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE STILL REMEMBER THAT TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF HAVING TO MAKE THOSE TOUGH DECISIONS AGAIN. WE NEED THE STABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PLAN OUR BUDGETS INTO THE FUTURE. AT THE CURRENT TIME. WITH NO PLANNED INCREASE THE FUNDING BEYOND COLA. STRUGGLING IT WITH ISSUES SUCH AS IF WE HAVE ENOUGH FUNDS TO DEDICATE TO MAKING OUR SCHOOLS SAFER. NOT PROVIDING EMPLOYEES RAISES. OR AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR TEACHERS HAVE THE BEST TOOLS FOR FOR EDUCATING STUDENTS. SO I AGAIN AYE I WANT TO THANK THE. THAT THE COMMITTEE FOR THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT ANY TIME FROM THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE. OKAY THANK YOU START CITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FIRST MISTER AGUILAR A THANK YOU VERY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. LACAN YOU START OFF BY TELLING US WHAT THE OTHER PEOPLE CAN COUNTIES INSECT MONEY INFO. ABOUT SEVENTY TWO PERCENT SEVENTY TWO CHRIS SO. HIGH BUT TO JUST UNDER THE LA OWES. CHARACTERIZATION OF A HIGH POVERTY DISTRICT BUT NONETHELESS. LARGE. POPULATION OF ARIBA TITLE ONE. NO ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND AND FOSTER KIDS. AND. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT YOUR NUMBER ONE CHALLENGE. ARE THE. THAT DRAMATIC RAMPING UP OF THE PENSION COSTS THAT'S CORRECT. AND AND YOU INDICATED THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS YOU'RE STIRS COSTS ITSELF WILL DOUBLE. CORRECT HIM. SO. YEAH V.. AND WHY WHILE THE GOVERNOR. IS IS. NOW. A PROUD TO TALK ABOUT I BELIEVE THE SIXTY SIX PERCENT AND. OUR OVERALL EDUCATION FUNDING INCREASE. SINCE THE RECESSION. NONETHELESS YOU YOU ARE FACING THESE CHALLENGES. DESPITE. I I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY YOU'RE RECEIVING A LOT MORE CONCENTRATION SUPPLEMENTAL DOLLARS AND SAVE TORRANCE UNIFIED CORRECT. SO. IT IS IS IT IS IT FAIR TO SAY I'M A HEARING. FROM A LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS LIKE LIKE SACRAMENTO UNIFIED. AND SUBURBAN DISTRICTS LIKE TORRANCE UNIFIED. YOU'RE IN AGREEMENT THAT. THE PACE GRANT IS INADEQUATE AND THEIR BEST WAY TO. ADDRESS YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE ARE IS TO INCREASE THE BASE GRANT THAT'S OUR POSITION. THANK YOU I I OF APPROVAL FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON THAT SAME ISSUE AS WELL SO CLEARLY THE THE ISSUE WE HEARD FROM YOU. THEY PRETEND THAT YOU ARE AND. DEBBIE SUPERINTENDENTS DOUGH. IS THAT COMPENSATION COSTS ESPECIALLY THAT THE PENSION COSTS. ARE OUR BIG CHALLENGE NOT ONLY IN THE FUTURE BUT AS YOU SAID FROM THIRTEEN. FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SAID WE OFTEN THIRTEEN MILLION TO THIRTY THREE NINE SO YOU ALREADY DOUBLED. AND YEAH. KNOWING THAT THEY WERE BEING THE THAT DESIRES TO HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT IF IT IF IT CAME AND I'M. MORE RESOURCES THROUGH LCF AFTER OR. IF WE YOU KNOW MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO CASTERS THE ONE TIME MONEY LIKE WE KINDA DID WITH WITH. PARIS IN THE PRIOR YEARS. YEAH DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. TT ALL HOW THAT WOULD PUT COME FORWARD. JERRY I SUPPOSE. YOU KNOW THAT OUR COMMITMENT WOULD BE TO ADVANCE THE SPIRIT OF LC FF AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS AROUND PENSION COSTS SO I'M AS LONG AS WE COULD COVER THOSE EXPENSES. HE'D RATHER HAVE IT NOT HAVE INCREASED ELSE FF BUT HAVE A LOWER. CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT FROM ESSENTIALLY CASTERS LA I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS BUT CERTAINLY OF THOSE THAT ARE. IN GREATEST NEED IN OUR DISTRICT IS A DISTRICT FORTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND. TEN MONTHS INTO MY POSITION I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE OUR ENGLISH LEARNER STAND WHERE OUR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH. AS WELL AS OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND SEVERAL OTHER GROUPS AS WELL. AND I OR I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW IT AS WE THINK ABOUT. THE THE PLANNED FOR STABILITY AND AND LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE. I THINK SUCH TYING SOMETHING TO THE LC FF. A AN ASPIRATIONAL TARGET WOULD HELP US GET TO THAT WOULD WOULD HELP US PLAN AND HELP US GET TO THAT WHERE. WHERE WE WANT OUR TO BE FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS? AND YOU KNOW GETTING FUNDING. IN NOW IN NINETEEN IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO WHAT IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION STILL PUTS US. YOU KNOW IN IN THE LOWER HALF OF OF THE COUNTRY AND YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S OUR CORE BELIEF IN AND. HOPE IS THAT WE CAN HAVE SET THAT ASPIRATIONAL TARGET. THAT CAN ABSORB THE THE ONGOING COSTS. WHILE WHILE KEEPING THOSE ARE DECISIONS TO BE MADE LOCALLY ON HOW WE BEST ADDRESS. THE. THE THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS WITH IN OUR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES AND HAVE HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE EQUITY ISSUE AS FAR AS. A THAT THE PURSE COSTS ARE THE SAME THING IN IN IN OTHER WORDS WE DID THIS CHANGE FIVE YEARS AGO I THAT WE MADE THE RIGHT CALL THAT. WOULD FOCUS ON EQUITY THAT YOU KNOW SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT KIND DUPLICATING COUNTER DIFFERENT THAN. THIRTY THIRTY THREE PERCENT THAT THAT THE NEEDS TO BRING THAT STUDENT SUCCESS ARE DIFFERENT AND I THINK. RESEARCH SHOWS COMMONSENSE KIND OF SHOWS THAT BUT THAT STIRS COSTS ARE THE SAME FOR YOU FOR YOUR DISTRICT SO HOW HOW DO WE RECONCILE THE FACT THAT. THAT THE FUNDING STRUCTURE DOESN'T ALWAYS. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. SO. I'M I'M NOT QUITE SURE I'M I'M I'M NOT THE THIS STATE FINANCE EXPERTS. AND BUT YOU KNOW FROM FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL. IF IF THAT OBLIGATION WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US. THEN THEN AND AND WE COULD PLAN FOR THAT. OF THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WAS A ONE TIME PAYMENT TO STARS RIPPERS TOOK TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN FOR THE SHORT TIME. IS IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE BRITISH A ONE TIME FUNDS. AND SO. SO IF THERE'S IF THERE'S AN ONGOING PLAN TO HELP US ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE THOSE NEEDS. IN THE LONG TERM THEN THEN WE CAN ADEQUATELY ADEQUATELY PLAN AT AND. AND AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ARE SOLID AND AND THAT WE. THAT THAT WERE NOT. YEAR TO YEAR. ASK YOU KNOW. TRYING TO TRYING TO SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT. THAT THE FUNDS THAT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A IT IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT. WHEN THE STATE ECONOMY IS. GOING CRAZY AND THE STOCK MARKET'S UP AND YET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL CUTS AND I KNOW PEOPLE IN DISTRICTS THAT BUT THERE DID DID LAYOFFS THIS YEAR FOR NEXT YEAR. AND SO. YOU OF THAT IT AND IT'S BECAUSE OF OF THE LACK OF ABILITY TO PLAN AND THAT. IT'S CONFUSING THAT THE. THE COMMUNITY AND AND TORRANCE FOR SURE. OKAY. THERE'S NO QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL ISSUE ONE MISTER JARVIS. OR TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING TOUGH FOR THE. THIS DISCUSSION THEY'LL CFM HAVING BETTER. FOR SIX YEARS NOW WATCHING IT COME THROUGH. I THINK WHEN THE PRINCIPAL WE STARTED WITH WAS THAT. WE WANTED TO ADD SOME STABILITY TO THIS WHOLE SYSTEM THAT'S WHY DEVELOP THOSE YOU HAVE FOR THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD PLAN WHEN I KNOW ON HOUSING ISSUES ACT OUT IT WAS ODD THAT. START SPENDING MONEY BEFORE WE EVEN GOT OUR BUDGETS WE HAD THE. MAKE GUESSES DEFERRED ROBERT WE'RE TRYING TO GO. AND SO WHAT THIS AN ATTEMPT TO DO THIS. I'D DO QUESTION TO A DOCTOR STOKES JUDGING YOUR FUTURE FEW TIMES. THE. FULLY FUNDED THE LC FF. WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE GROUND WHERE SHOULD WE GO NEXT. SHOULD WE JUST SAY. FULLY FUNDED NEXT YEAR SO WE SAY THAT WAS A GOOD BENCHMARK BUT WE SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE. SOME OTHER MEASUREMENT IN SOME OTHER RESULTS FROM THAT. WOULD YOU THINK. BUT I THINK AN ASPIRATIONAL TARGET IS IMPORTANT. A YOU KNOW AS AS CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE DO WE WANT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM TO BE. AND HAVING BEEN BORN AND RAISED IN A GUN TO SCHOOL HERE AND AND NOW. WORKING IN THE SAME COMMUNITY THAT THAT AYE I WENT TO SCHOOL AND. FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW. YOU KNOW IT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THAT ARE OURS IS ANY DIFFERENT THAN THAN ANY COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE WHERE. PEOPLE WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR KIDS AND THEY WANT BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. AND. I I JUST LE. COMPLETED THE THE THICK MAT BOTTOM CBO MENTOR PROGRAM HERE IN SACRAMENTO I WAS COMING UP ONCE A MONTH FOR THE PAST YEAR. AND AND WORKING WITH CBO'S AND AND FUTURE CBO'S FROM ACROSS THE STATE. AND. AND AND THE MESSAGE WAS WAS. COMMENT. RIGHT AND. AND YOU DON'T WORK WERE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE. MAYBE MAKE MAKE CUTS AND REDUCE. STIPENDS IN ATHLETICS OR OF TRANSPORTATION AND OR YOU KNOW IT WERE KIND OF NICKEL AND DIMING AND SO. YET PEOPLE GET TIRED OF THAT RIGHT AND AND UNDERSTANDABLE WHAT WOULD YOU THINK. WE'RE ON A PERSONAL CFF WHERE SHOULD WE GO NEXT YEAR. THEN I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THAT ASPIRATIONAL TARGET BECAUSE YEAH THIS IS WHAT YOU MEAN NUMBER GIMME THOUGHT. WELL KIND OF WHAT YOU KNOW SET SETTING SETTING A NEW BAR. TO GET TO AND TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND MR CHáVEZ BURKE WE'RE GONNA GET THERE IN JUST A SECOND LET ME CAN I GOT THAT'S IS REASON I'M DOING THIS. THE JOB WHICH GOES TO MY NEXT THING ON THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. WHEN WE STARTED LC FF FIVE YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP NOW WE'VE BEEN GOING IN THE PROGRAM I'M WONDERING. WHEN YOU START FUELING THE ENGINE. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO START SOON? THE RESULTS. IN THE CHURCH AND THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR THE KIDS. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW IF A CHILD COMES IN IN A SAFE. BECAUSE WE DEEP WE GET FUNDED FULLY. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OR EIGHT NOW THEY'RE. AND HIGH SCHOOL. IS PROBABLY AN IMPACT UPON THEIR ACADEMIC SKILLS A MINUTE DATA PROBLEM MATH READING BECAUSE WE START WE WANT FUNDING EVERYTHING WE CAN AND WE HAD A PROBLEM. ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN OF COLOR. NOW WE'RE FULLY FUNDING IT WHEN DO WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING THE RESULTS FROM THAT IS I DON'T THINK IT STARTS THE NEXT YEAR OR THAT WEEK I MEAN. I THINK IT STARTS. IN THE FUTURE SOMETIME BUT I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL LIKE YOU ARE. WHEN YOU THINK THE CHEAP WHEN WE GIVE MONEY WHEN WE SEE THE RESULTS FROM OUR MONEY. TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS HOW FAR DOWN THE LINE. YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA VERY. I KNOW THAT THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH WITH THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING WE'VE SEEN SOME VERY TARGETED. SERVICES AND AND AND ACTIONS. BE PUT INTO PLACE I THINK THE ALL CAP IS A GOOD DOCUMENT. I I THINK THAT PROCESS IS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO INVOLVE STAKEHOLDERS. ALL ALONG THE WAY. AND THEN I WOULD CONTINUE THAT THE THE. NEW ACCOUNTABILITY MODEL TO TRY TO NOT GET SCHOOLS TO TO REALLY. HONE IN ON ON CERTAIN SUBGROUPS AND AND SCHOOLS AND EH YOU KNOW WITH REGARD TO THE EIGHT STATE CONTENT ARE EIGHT SIT PRIORITY AREAS. AND THAT'S THAT'S A A GREAT MODEL THAT. THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH IN SOME WAYS BUT. IN TRYING TO FIND DATA FIRST FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THE MEASURE IS DIFFICULT STUDENT ENGAGEMENT FOR EXAMPLE. BUT BUT THOSE IF IF SCHOOLS CAN CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND AND IDENTIFY USING DATA. HOW STUDENTS ARE ACHIEVING? AYE AYE I HEARD. OF SUPERDELEGATE BOUT COUNSELING AND NURSES AND AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THINGS AS WELL. DEBTS THAT ARE HARDER TO MEASURE WHEN WHEN STUDENTS ARE MORE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ANYA ATTENDS ART I UNDERSTAND THE HARDER TO MEASURE IT VARIES BETWEEN EVERYBODY I'M TRACK WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET YOU THE FIRST QUESTION I WAS. WHY I WANTED TO CONTINUE THIS LINE OF THOUGHT IS THAT WE'RE FULLY FUNDING THE LC FF? AND IF IMPACT A FULL OF FUN AND YOU'LL SEE IF F. IS GOING TO BE THIS YEAR GOING TO BE. DOWN YEARS AND THE WHOLE REASON WE'RE JOINED IS DRILL IS TO BRING OUR ACADEMIC STANDARD HIGHER FOR OUR STUDENTS SO THAT THEY ARE. PREPARED TO GO OFF IN COLLEGE INTO ONE OF THE THINGS. AND THEIR LIVES SO IF WE'RE FULLY FUNDING THE LC FF NOW. THE IMPACT OF THAT WILL BE. TEN YEARS FROM NOW TWO YEARS FROM NOW WHEN WILL THIS THING BE. IN WHICH TIED TO MY EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE LC FF'S IS SHOULD BE HIGHER BECAUSE? WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO AND I FIRST GOT ELECTED YEAR WAS? TO MOVE THE ACADEMICS IN CALIFORNIA FROM BE IN. FORTY EIGHTH IN THE NATION TO ISIDRO CROWD KARADZIC CAN WE GET TO THIRTY NINE. CAN WE GET A THIRTIES SEX I DON'T KNOW GIVE ME A NUMBER AND WHAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS WE WOULD GET THERE AND I THINK. RESOURCES MATTER LIKE VLC AFFAIR FOR THE RESULTS THAT WOULD COME FOR THAT SHOULD BE. DOWNLINE AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE LIKE ELEVATE THE DISCUSSION. A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THIS. TAKE KILLER ISSUES AS WELL UNDER BRING IT UP. DESCEND QUICKLY SO YOU CAN GO ON. THE YEAH WE LIVE. REPUBLICAN CAUCUS SOME OF THE MEMBERS AGAIN BE PUTTING. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL SUPPLEMENTAL SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGICAL PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT AND. KNOCKED AT MISTER AGUILAR YOU MENTIONED THAT WAS A. IN ISSUES OF THAT WILL BE COMING FORWARD OUT OF THE BE SUPPORTED BY ANYBODY BUT. YOU WANT TO SIGN ON WOULD APPRECIATE IT. THINK. DEPRESSED ENDORSEMENT THAT YEAH RIGHT. YES MISTER MARTZ ITCHY THE THANK YOU AYE. WOULD LIKE TO. GO BACK TO THE ISSUE OF. THE TREATMENT GAP. THOUGHT THE LA O. STARTED OFF THIS MORNING TALKING ABOUT HOW. THE HIGH PARTY DISTRICTS ARE RECEIVING TWENTY THREE PERCENT MORE THAN LOW POPPY DISTRICTS. AND DESPITE THAT. THE HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS. OR. IT THE CALIFORNIA'S ACHIEVEMENT GAP. ACCORDING TO THE LA O. AS MEASURED BY THE NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS HAS NOT NARROWED. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. SUPERINTEND ACT OF OUR. HOW DO YOU SEE THE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION DOLLARS MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN SACRAMENTO AND FOR? THANK YOU MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN YOU KNOW. INTERESTINGLY TODAY. WE ARE OFFERING THE SAT TO OLIVER JUNIORS USING SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES. ARE IN SEXY UNIFIED. AND AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING I'VE ONLY BEEN SUPERINTENDENT FOR TEN MONTHS A LOT OF MY EXPERIENCES FROM MY LAST POST AND PRESIDENT UNIFIED WHERE I WAS THERE FOR. EIGHT PLUS YEARS. AND. WE DID. TAKE A VERY DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND PART OF THAT. APPROACH IS THAT. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A CHIEF MEANT AYE AND DATA AS SOMETHING THAT INFORMS US BUT NOT TO PROVE BUT RATHER A TO IMPROVE. AND OVER THE. COURSE OF THOSE EIGHT YEARS WE SAW. A VERY BIG INCREASES AND. IMPORTANT MILESTONE MARKERS SUCH AS GRADUATION AT ATG COMPLETION. COLLEGE GOING ON MATTERS AND AND THIS WAS A RIGHT NOT JUST FOR ALL STUDENTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR GROUPS OF STUDENTS THAT PRIOR TO. ARE THOSE AND INITIATIVES. WERE UNDER OR OVER REPRESENTED. AND THAT IS SOME OF THOSE SAME EXPERIENCES WE'VE BROUGHT A SAX CITY UNIFIED AND ARE. LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT. ACHIEVEMENT OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND AS I EXPRESSED EARLIER I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. SOME OF THE VERY POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS THAT ELSIE FF WAS INTENDED TO SERVE. THANK YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPENED I THINK THERE WILL BE. A SIGNIFICANT ACTION. WITH THE MAY REVISE AND WOOD THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IN A FEW MONTHS BUT HOLD IT HOLD IT OPEN FOR NOW. AND WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GOOD ISSUE NUMBER TWO. HEALTH THIS IS THAT KIND OF ATTACK ON HERE OF COURSE LCS PATH THAT BUDGET PROPOSALS AND WE HAVE THREE. PROPOSALS THAT WE WANT TO CONSIDER DURING THE DELIBERATION PROCESS OF THAT SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND WE WANT IT. GIVEN OVERVIEW OF THIS MORNING OF OF THESE SO THERE ARE WE'RE DOING THIS A BIT DIFFERENTLY. SO THEY'RE THREE PROPOSALS OUTLINED HERE AND NOT TO SAY THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSALS THAT WE WANT CONSIDER THIS YEAR BUT THESE ARE THE THREE THAT ARE KIND ARE RISING TO THE TOP SO FAR. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LA HAUTE FROM TO FINANCE TO PROVOCATION GIVE THAT. AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT. AND TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS THE PROPOSAL AND THEN WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT'S A PUBLIC COMMENTS. FOR EACH OF THAT PROPOSAL SO ISSUE NUMBER ONE. IS THE. INCREASE AND IF THE LC FF BASE IN ITS IS. A KIND OF A FOLLOW UP FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. GOOD MORNING BRIAN ANDERSON OF THE LEGISLATIE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IT'S AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO BE. DISCUSSING A SERIES OF THREE PROPOSALS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS A AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. AN INCREASE THEY'LL SEE IF ATHLETES RATES AND THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE THE SPACE RACE. BY ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT. WELL IT'S AN IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THIS CHANGE WOULD NOT IN ITSELF. IMMEDIATELY. I'D COMMIT THE STATE OF SPENDING ANY ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ON EDUCATION AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. I AND WITH US NOT. IMMEDIATELY RESULT AND A SCHOOLS RECEIVING MORE FUNDING AND INSTEAD WHAT THIS WOULD DO WOULD. MEAN WE'D BE MOVING OUT THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION DATE BY AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF YEARS. DOES SO AS WAS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY THIS WOULD BE MORE ABOUT SENDING. AN AMBITIOUS TARGET. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TWO MEMBERS ETERNITY OF IT AGAIN. WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME I THINK WE JUST KNOW THAT WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BUT HAPPY TO DISCUSS FURTHER ITS WELL THEIR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DEBORAH BAND OF THE OFFICE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TOPICS AND AND AS WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THROUGHOUT THIS A YEAR THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT STRONGLY SUPPORTS INCREASING THAT THE BASE FUNDING AND SO WE ARE SUPPOSE SUPPORTING THIS UP. PROPOSAL AND THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD WAY FOR US TO TO BE ON A TRAJECTORY TO INCLUDE MORE FUNDING FOR LCF. OKAY THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW FOR EACH OF THESE PROPOSAL SO WE CAN LINE UP IN THE MIDDLE AND WHILE WORKING LINE THAT THEY BEGIN ASK QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HERE. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT COMMENTING ON THIS PROPOSAL. BUT WHETHER IT'S THIS YEAR THE NEXT YEAR IF THERE WAS ADDITIONAL PROP NINETY EIGHT. DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO SPEND FOR EDUCATION WOULD YOU SEE IT AS A YEAR TO YEAR ANALYSIS OR DO YOU THINK IT'S IT'S WISE AS AS WE OUTLINED HERE. TO ON TO HAVE ADDITIONAL MARKER. BASICALLY LC FF TWO POINT NOW. RIGHT STREET I THINK. OUR PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE. THAT MUCH LIKE SUPERINTENDENTS NOTED IN I THINK THEY DID A GREAT JOB PAINTING A PICTURE FOR US OF. THE CHALLENGES THAT LOCALS ARE DEALING WITH BECAUSE THEY ARE REAL CHALLENGES AND WE AND WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO. MINIMIZE THAT BUT JUST LIKE THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THEIR CHALLENGES A BUDGETING DIFFICULT DECISIONS. INFINITE NEEDYOU COULD ARGUE WITH FINITE RESOURCES WE ARE GOING THROUGH MUCH THE SAME PROCESS ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS. AND SO. WE CONTINUE TO FEEL THAT CONTINUING TO HAVE A CUSHION OF SOME ONE TIME A MONIES DEDICATED TO DISCRETION WHEN I'M PURPOSES WITHIN THE NINETYGUARANTEE. ARM IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE APPROACH AT THIS POINT AND I THINK I WOULD KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT WE. I'M YOU KNOW COMMIT OURSELVES TO I'M HAVING TO COMMIT. FURTHER RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY LC FF WITHIN PROP NINETY IN FUTURE YEARS WHILE CERTAINLY A NOBLE GOAL TO DO THAT ON ITS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF AN ALREADY IN A LARGELY COMMITTED GUARANTEED. AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR EXAMPLE K. TWELVE FUNDING RECEIVES ABOUT SIXTY NINE BILLION OF THE TOTAL OF THE SEVENTY EIGHT. JUST OVER SEVENTY EIGHT BILLION IN THE GUARANTEE AND THEN ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF BILLION GOES TO COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND THEN BEYOND THAT IT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUDGET SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE BEGIN TO START COMMITTING OURSELVES TO THESE. ARM. INCREASES THE CIVIC EVEN I'LL SEE IF IT STARTS BUT PRESSURE AND THEN WE OF THE STATE RIGHT HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION. OKAY ARE WE GOING TO REDUCE ANOTHER PROGRAM WITHIN NINETY EIGHT EVER GONNA ELIMINATE THEM SO WE'RE DEALING WITH IN A MUCH THE SAME KINDS OF DECISIONS AND AT THIS POINT WE CONTINUE TO FEEL THAT. BECAUSE OF THAT NEW WANTS ITS THE MOST APPROPRIATE THING TO CONTINUE ON A ON A YEAR TO YEAR. HOW APPROACH FUND ELSE IF IF AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY ENACTED? BUT IT CERTAINLY THE PREROGATIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE OTHER PROPOSALS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WHAT THE COMMITTEE PROCESSES FOR. SO. THAT'S HELPFUL OKAY THANK YOU. SORRY PUBLIC COMMENT TURN MEMBERS BRED STRONG AND YOU HEARD THE OLEO TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE TO THE HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS. BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW IF HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING MORE OF THAT ADDITIONAL MONEY. I'M ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN NOW WE DO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE BASE. I'M AND SPLIT A CONSISTENT WITH THE EXISTING FORMULA A BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AND NEEDED TRANSPARENCY THE FULL AND FUNDING OF THE THEATER TRANSPARENCY THAT KICKS IN AT FULLER FULL FUNDING. IS THAT THAT IS MAINTAINED ADDITIONALLY WE DO RECOMMEND SEVERAL REASONABLE BUT CRITICAL I CHANGES THAT CONSERVE. TEN CHRIS TRANSPARENCY WILL WELL AND PROVIDING COMMUNITIES WITH CENTRALIZED ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES TO AND MEANINGFUL READ AND I'M. MATERIALS TO ENGAGE IN EL CAP PLANNING AND AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE LANGUAGE ON THAT AND I'M WE DO NOT THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE SENATE PROPOSAL PROVIDES AND SUFFICIENT TRANSPARENCY AT THE CURRENT TIME THINK. THANK YOU AND I DIDN'T I REMIND FOLKS THAT YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP IT TO ONE MINUTE THANK YOU. SARAH MUCH AS THE CAST BUT WE COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR CONTINUING TO SUPPORT LCF OFF. WITHOUT WE DO URGE THAT WE CONTINUE TO ASPIRE TO GOAL THE FULLY FUNDS OUR NEEDS FOR OUR STUDENTS AND BECAUSE OF THAT. KASBAH SUPPORTS AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT THINK YOU THINK YOU. GOOD MORNING MITCHELL MCKAY UNDERWOOD FROM SCHOOL SERVICES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING OAKLAND UNIFIED AND FRESNO UNIFIED ON VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS CONVERSATION AND SETTING ASPIRATIONAL TARGETS. ON THESE DISTRICTS ARE CONCERNED IN THE CURRENT ELSE FF ENVIRONMENT THAT A COLA ONLY WILL NOT COVER THEIR INCREASED UP COSTS AND THAT FUTURE YEARS SO. I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL AND UP ISSUE THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. MORNING AGAIN TIM SO TOWARDS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD SAYING THAT TORRANCE SUPPORTS INCREASING THE. BASED GRANT FUNDING THANK YOU. YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL HOLE SIZE ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE KERN COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOLS AND OR FORTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SERVE ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE COUNTY. ARMED ON ON THIS ISSUE. IN THE TOPIC NUMBER ONE WE JUST WANT TO BE VERY EMPHATIC THAT ARE DISTRICTS UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR SELL CFF. AND THEY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO AND ENCOURAGED BY THE PROPOSAL COMING FROM THE LEGISLATURE WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD PROPOSAL NUMBER ONE. THAT TO DEGREE THERE ARE AVAILABLE ON GOING FUNDS IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE WOULD CERTAINLY. US SUPPORT TARGETING THOSE FUNDS TO INCREASING THE LC FF. SECONDLY IN ANSWER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAVEZ'S QUESTION WE THINK THERE ALREADY IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE LC FF INTRONS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IF YOU'VE NOT DONE SO. WE WOULD REFER YOU TO THE RECENT RESEARCH BY JOHNSON AND TEN AROUND IF YOU SEE BERKELEY WHICH SHOWS VERY CLEARLY. IF THE INVESTMENTS OF LCF A FUNDS IN SUPPLEMENTAL THE CONCENTRATION DOLLARS I'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR THE TARGETED POPULATIONS STUDENTS. OUR OWN EXPERIENCE OF OUR OWN DISTRICTS IN KERN REINFORCES THAT I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THE KERN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT THE LARGEST HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PRIOR TO THE ALL CFF HAD SIGNIFICANT A CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM LOWER GRADUATION RATES. AND HIGHER SUSPENSION RATES THAN AVERAGE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE AND COMPARABLE DISTRICTS. NOW AFTER FIVE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTING MLC FF AND GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED THEM. THEY'VE MADE THAT A PRIORITY AND THEY NOW HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER GRADUATION RATES THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. THEIR SUSPENSION RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW PARTICULARLY FOR THE TARGETED POPULATIONS. DOES THAT DOES THAT DATA IS ECHOED BY MANY OF OUR OTHER DISTRICTS IN ANY IN OTHER AREAS THAT THEY'VE TARGETED BUT OUR DISTRICTS OF RESOUNDINGLY SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT. GOOD MORNING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AYE WE DO SUPPORT. INCREASING THE LCF AFTER APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS I REGARDING THAT WE HAVE TAKEN A SUPPORT POSITION ON AB TWENTY NEED OEF SHOULD ASSEMBLYMEMBER SU CHI'S. I. SUPPORT AND LEADING NOT CONVERSATION FOR AND WE ALSO SUPPORT CONVERSATIONS THAT A NUMBER OF SENATE DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT FORWARD BECAUSE THAT PROVIDES PRACTICAL FUNDS NOW I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WILL. DOT IS ALSO IN CONTACTS WITH CONVERSATIONS ABOUT INCREASING SPECIAL LET FUNDING TO WE ALSO SUPPORT A. B. THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE DON'T SUPPORT THESE. IF IT. WE DON'T SUPPORT THE CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT JEOPARDIZING THE RETIREMENT SECURITY OF OUR MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE TOOK A VERY STRONG. STANCE A NUMBER YEARS AGO WHEN THEY MOVED A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE WHICH PROVIDES RETIREMENT SECURITY TORE EDUCATORS WHO ARE SEVENTY TWO PERCENT WOMEN. SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT HAVING CONVERSATIONS THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE RETIREMENT SECURITY OF OUR MEMBERS IS ALSO AN ATTACK ON WOMEN WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY DO NOT HAVE RETIREE HEALTH IN WHO ALSO DO NOT HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. SO WE DON'T THINK THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IT MEANS IT HAS TO BE DONE ON THE BACKS OF THOSE THAT ARE PRIMARILY SERVING OUR STUDENTS. AND WE WE WOULD SUPPORT MORE CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. I'M GOOD MORNING SUSAN MONIA ON BEHALF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS MILITARY LEADERS AND BUSINESS LEADERS WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT. THE INCREASE OF THE BASS GRANT WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANT ALSO BE INCREASED. IT'S YOU KNOW GREAT WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS. BUT THAT'S WAS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FUNDING LEVELS WE ALL KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS AN ASPIRATIONAL GOAL IT'S AGO WE HAVE TO MEET. AND. I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S IT IS ABOUT THE FUNDING BUT GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING ON THE INSTRUCTION SIDE AS WELL WITH COMMON CORE IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE REALLY SEEING A LOT OF GOOD THINGS HAPPEN IN OUR SCHOOLS WITH OUR TEACHERS AND INSTRUCTION IN THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THEY'RE GETTING SO. THE MONEY HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT THE TEACHERS ARE ALSO MAKING A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE AND. I THINK WE NEED TO BE A MAYBE FIND A WORD OTHER THAN ASPIRATIONAL FOR WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET. WHAT WE WANT IS REALLY A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION FOR EVERY STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU? THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF STAFF JEFF AKA REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS ON THE TWENTY THREE SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY. BOB I THINK A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY IS POINTING TO THE FACT THAT LCF F. WAS NEVER ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OF FUNDING. IT WAS ABOUT A DISTRIBUTION MODEL BASED ON A FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF EQUITY. WHICH WE CONTINUE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. OUT WE SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF MERCY CHEESE LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT MAINTAINS THAT STRUCTURE MOVING FORWARD. OF WE THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE YET TO BE HAD ABOUT THE DETAILS. OF HOW THIS WORKS BUT T THE END OF THE DAY. THE THEME THAT YOU'RE HEARING AND MUCH OF THE TESTIMONY IS THAT THERE SIMPLY AREN'T ARE NOT ENOUGH DOLLARS TO. ACHIEVE WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT ALTHOUGH LIKE MR HOLE SIZE ARE PERFORMING WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE. A LIST OF SIX SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY SCHOOLS THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND YOU CAN WATCH ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MUCH LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HERE WERE ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF. EFFORTS TO INCREASE LCF I'VE TALKED TARGETS INCLUDING AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT AS WELL SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. STEVE WARD LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S FOR CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE SCHOOL FUNDING BECAUSE A COALITION IN OUR FORTY SEVEN DISTRICTS AND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WE REPRESENT. WE'VE WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR FULLY FUNDING THE LCF F. AND WE ALSO FULLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLYMAN NEAR SU CHI'S AB I TWENTYEIGHT OO EIGHT. WHICH WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BASE GRANT AND ALLOW US TO FIND THOSE NEW MANDATED COSTS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY WHILE ALSO ALLOWING US TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR BEST FIRST INSTRUCTION. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ONGOING DOLLARS TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M BRIAN REAVIS REPRESENTING THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST. WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THE COST PRESSURES AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH BY CONSIDERING INCREASES TO THE BASE GRANT. BUT ONE THING WE WOULD URGE CAUTION ABOUT IS. TRANSPARENCY. OF IN OUR COMMUNITY AND POLICY WORK I'LL SHARE OUR VIEWIS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO SUPPORT LCF F.. BUT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE PRETTY EASILY WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S HELPING THE TARGETED STUDENTS. SO IN CONSIDERING INCREASING THE BASE GRANT WERE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN ACCIDENTS ESPN MISTER MERRETT SU CHI'S PROPOSAL TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO DO THAT WITH. WHILE ALSO AVOIDING PUTTING US BACK INTO AN IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY MURKY BLEND DISTRICTS HAD TO CALCULATE FOR THEMSELVES. HOW MUCH THEY HAD TO SPEND AND DO A SERIES OF CALCULATIONS IT WAS JUST VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT? SO WE'RE WORKING TOWARD THAT END WITH OUR PARTNERS. GERMAN MEMBERS DENNIS MYERS CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION. JUST WANT TO CAUTION YOU ABOUT USING THE TERMS FULLY FUNDING LCF F. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER REALLY GOING TO BE DONE IMPLEMENTING ELSE FF SO. THE NEXT STEPS ARE WHAT DO WE DO ONCE WE REACH THE TARGETS AND SO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES THAT WE KNOW THE SENATE DEMOCRATS BY NOT GOING A LITTLE FURTHER AT THAT WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT CONVERSATION. SO YES SUPPORTING. ADDITIONAL HIGHER TARGETS IS A GOOD THING WE THINK IT HELPS US ALL TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE GOAL WHICH IS. FULL AND FAIR FUNDING IN MOVING US BEYOND OTHER COMMITMENTS THAT ONLY PROP NINETY EIGHT CAN GIVE US AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO TO MOVE THE NEEDLE AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA SO YES WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE. RECORDS PUNCHING AB TWENTY TO WAIT WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION THE WHAT WE DO TO MOVE THE SYSTEM A LOT FURTHER THAN THAT AND I'M JUST WE'VE BEEN TARGETING SO FAR SOMETHING CAN. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RON RAP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ON WHERE PERCENT OF OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO. FIND THE. THE GAP NOW CFF A WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TIME FOR LCF ALPHA TWO POINT NO. WE THINK THAT OF FULLY FUNDING THAT GAP. ADDRESSES THE EQUITY ISSUE BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY A NEED AS YOU WELL KNOW AND THANK YOU FOR THIS CONVERSATION AS YOU WELL KNOW TO. A RAISE THE BASE. FUNDING IN A TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT LEVEL ON BEING FORTY THIRD IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF JUST A PER PUPIL FUNDING. IS UNACCEPTABLE AND WE APPLAUD ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARISA CHIEF FOR HIS AUTHORSHIP OF TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT WE'VE SIGNED ON AS A CO SPONSOR. I THINK THIS WILL BE A LONG TERM CONVERSATION. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE WHO JUST SPOKE THAT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT. REVENUE AND AND HOW DO WE REVISE THE WAY WE FUND PUBLIC EDUCATION. BUT WE DEFINITELY SUPPORT INCREASING THE PACE GRANT THANK YOU. QUORUM KAI JACKSON WITH SENEGAL UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. CERTAINLY LIKE TO ALIGN OURSELVES. WITH THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUE AT CSPA AND SUPPORT. A FULL AND FAIR FUNDING FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELSE FF AND SUPPORT OF TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT. IN ADDITION THERE'S HOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THE LC FF IT'S WORKING INCENDIO UNIFY WANTS TO REAFFIRM ITS COMMITMENT TO ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. ARE WE LIKE TO JAZZ ARE ALSO NOTE THAT I'M AS OF TODAY. THE NATION'S REPORT CARD CAME OUT AND SAY NEW UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT RANKED NUMBER ONE IN ALL OF THE UNITED STATES. FOR ACADEMIC GROWTH BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN PARTICULARLY IN THE FOURTH AND EIGHTH GRADES AND WOULD LIKE TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT BE HAPPY TALK TO MORE OFTEN. OFFLINE ABOUT HOW THAT IS BEING. UP SUPPORTEDTHROUGH THE LC FF IN THE COMMITMENT OF OUR. SO WITH THAT I THINK YOU FOR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WE ARE EXTREMELY ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND FULLY FUND THAT. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT AB TWENTY IT'LL EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MERITS ITCHY AND ALSO WORKING WITH THE SENATE ON THEIR PROPOSAL. TO INCREASE THE BASE GRANT WE I WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH BOTH RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND KERN COUNTIES COMMENTS ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS OF THAT ARE HAPPENING UNDER LC FF. AS WELL AS MISTER KAI JACKSON FROM SAN DIEGO WE ARE ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH ALL OF OUR EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ASSIST THEM ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE NEEDING DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. SO WE HAVE VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE COUNTIES OUT WITH THOSE DISTRICTS WOULD AFFORD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND FURTHER ON INCREASING. ARE BOTH OF THESE. ITEMS INCLUDING THE THAT BASS GRANT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AND MANY SILVA FROM SAITEK OR A NETWORK OF DROPOUT RECOVERY SCHOOLS WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT AWAY. IN ADDITION WE'VE SPONSORED A. BILL THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER HAS INTRODUCED THAT WOULD INCREASE THE BASE GRANT FOR SCHOOLS. PROVIDING. OF RECOVERY TO DROPOUTS TO THE SAME LEVEL AS COUNTY OFFICES RECEIVE FOR EXPELLED STUDENTS AND PROBATION INVOLVED STUDENTS THAT THE UC DAVIS STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT SIX TWO ONE THE NINE TO ONE. A BENEFIT COST RATIO BY RE ENGAGING MORE OF OUR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND OUT OF SCHOOL. THANK THANK YOU. IF YOU ARE COMES BUSINESS WHAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT DID THIS IS NOT THE BILL HEARING. I KNOW THAT MISTER MARTZ WHICH HE HAS A BILL TALKED WEBER AS A BILL. THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE THE IDEAS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CONCEPT IN THE LANDS OF THE BUDGET. SO REFERENCING THE BILL PROBABLY DOESN'T DO A LOT OF EFFORT TO NOT THINK MISTER MARTZ WHO SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WILL BE HEARD IN POLICY COMMUNITY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THIS IS A DIFFERENT. PROCESS TODAY SO HE COULD FOCUS ON THE CONTENT OF THE ISSUE AND NOT. REPEAT THE BILL NUMBER BE HELPFUL THING I WILL DO MY BEST MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS PAMELA LOPEZ ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. CONCEPTUALLY WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF INCREASING THE BASE GRANT OUT WE NOTE WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FULLY FUND LCF HALF. CERTAINLY SUPPORT SENATE DEMOCRATS PROPOSAL TO GO BEYOND THAT A LITTLE BIT. BUT WE WE'VE CERTAINLY NOT THAT EVEN WITH LCF AWFULLY FIND IT. CALIFORNIA BANKS I THINK IT IS FORTY THIRD OUT IN PER PUPIL FUNDING SO WE SUPPORT EFFORTS I INCLUDING ON HIM BILLS AT TO INC INCREASE AT THE BASE GRANT AND TO INCREASE EDUCATION FUNDING. WE ARE ALSO VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO SUPPORT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. I IN THE WORK THAT THEY DO WITH AYE DISTRICTS AT TO DEVELOP LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN THINK YOU THINK YOU. BILLY CO WITHOUT VOICE I'M SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE SUPPORT THE IDEA OF INCREASING THE BASE THE GOVERNOR ALSO HAS A PAGES LINK THAT NOTION OF INCREASING THE BASE TO TRANSPARENCY. AND INCREASE TRANSPARENCY WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE WORK DONE ON THAT THAT THIS THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE REALLY SHOULD TAKE LEADERSHIP IN THAT RESPECT. OF FEDERAL LAW ACTUALLY REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE IT OUT IN FRONT OF YOU AND IT ACTUALLY SAYS IT IN BLACK AND WHITE VERY CLEARLY IN THE STATE BOARD OF ED HAS MEETINGS THURSDAY IN THIS IS NOT A SUBJECT FOR WHICH. I THEY'RE ASKING WEAVER THE FEDS THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS IT'S ALREADY YEAR OVERDUE AND THE CALIFORNIA'S TO EXERCISE LEADERSHIP NOT JUST THE ENTITLED ONE MONIES. BEING DISTRIBUTED ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICTS BUT. CERTAINLY THE BASE AND SOMEONE AND CONCENTRATION MAKING SURE THAT IT'S GETTING AND IN THAT MOST NEEDED PLACES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ON THIS. REPULSED PROPOSAL. ESTIMATES IF YOU. UP FIRST OF ALL. SHARE I APPRECIATE YOUR. A REMINDER THAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON. THIS SUBJECT MATTER AND NOT AND IN THESE. BILLS AND. IDEA. DID NOT ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT MY BILL I WANT. YOU TO KNOW THAT. SO OF A GOING BACK TO. AND THE LA NO. WHAT? WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH YOU HAVE? IN ORDER TO BEST ADDRESS THE DISTRICTS CONCERNS OF DRAWING FIX BECAUSE. I'D I I'M SORRY OF OF WHICH SPECIFIC CONCERNS. WE HEARD FROM THE SUPERINTENDENTS THAT. THE. THE PENSION COSTS. ARE THE BIGGEST DRIVERS. YES YES SO. YOU REFERENCED EARLIER OUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ANALYSIS AND I IN THAT ANALYSIS WE HAVE A CHAPTER SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE. A IT IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT WE HEAR ABOUT FROM THE FIELD. THESE INCREASING PENSION BECAUSE AT THE END OF THAT ANALYSIS WE WE OFFER THREE GENERAL. OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER A OF WHICH THE FIRST WOULD BE CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON PROVIDING GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING. A AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE CONTINUING TO DEDICATE MOST NEW PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO SOURCES LIKE THE LC FF. ó OR TO THESE ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY GRANTS OF FURTHER SUGGESTION WE WE MADE WAS THAT. IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE GIVES ALONG WITH THE ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY GRANTS. THAT ARE OFFERED AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THERE IS ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. DEDICATED FOR THAT PURPOSE SO WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD EXPLICITLY SICK. SUGGEST OPTIONS FOR US ALLEVIATING FUTURE PENSION COST PRESSURES WE DO THINK THAT THAT DIRECTION IS MEANINGFUL AND HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SPENDING THOSE DOLLARS. AND THE LAST OPTION THAT WE WE PRESENT. WOULD BE. A PAYMENT ON BEHALF OF DISTRICTS OUT OF STATE FUNDS THIS COULD BE EITHER PROPOSITION OR NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS. WE THINK IF THE STATE WERE TO DEDICATE. AT LEAST SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND TO PREPAYING SOME DISTRICT OBLIGATIONS FOR DISTRICTS AND AND THEN CRAFTING SOME LANGUAGE WHICH. WOULD ASSOCIATE THE GAINS WITH THOSE PREPAYMENTS WITH SOME REDUCTION AND THE INCREASED PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATES FOR DISTRICTS THAT WOULD KICK CAN. FOR INSTANCE AT THE NEXT RECESSION OR AT ANY DIFFICULT FISCAL TIMES IN THE FUTURE THAT THAT COULD PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT RELIEF FOR DISTRICTS AT THE. THANK YOU AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I. CERTAINLY. ADMIRE YEAR. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE CAREFUL STATEMENT TO NOT THEY COMMIT TO ANY FUTURE BUDGETS. TO. ANY SPECIFIC. FUNDING TARGETS. BUT. WE WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR WE'RE HEARING LOUD AND CLEAR. NOT ONLY FROM. DISTRICTS WITH HIGH A DUPLICATED POPULATIONS AS WELL AS RELATIVELY LOWER. THAT. THERE ARE GROWING FIXED COSTS ARE NOT KEEPING PACE DESPITE. THE GOVERNOR. YOU KNOW. DELIVERING SIXTY SIX PERCENT AND INCREASED. EDUCATION FUNDING. SINCE THE RECESSION. SO WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES PLAN. TO. OUR WHAT DOES IT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROPOSE. TO ADDRESS THIS VERY REAL REALITY THAT WE'RE HEARING. FROM URBAN DISTRICTS SUBURBAN DISTRICTS ROLE DISTRICTS. ABOUT. THE RAPIDLY RISING FIXED COSTS THAT ARE NOT KEEPING PACE WITH THESE GOOD BUDGET. BUDGETS THAT THE THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN DELIVERING. I THINK. I WOULD NOTE TOM THAT. OBVIOUSLY THE IN THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BUT AGAIN. IT. COUPLED WITH INCREASING COSTS LIKE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT I'M WE DID PUT IN AS AS THE. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OUT MENTIONED SUGGESTING LANGUAGE IN OUR TRAILER BILL IT WOULDN'T ALREADY IN THERE. SPECIFYING THAT OF THAT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IT'S GONNA GO OUT FOR DISCRETIONARY ONETIME PURPOSES. OF SUGGESTING IN AND PUTTING IT IN THEIR IN LANGUAGE ACTUALLY TO SAY. THESE YOU KNOW CAN BE USED FOR. STEPPED BENEFIT COSTS. AND PENSION COSTS THAT THAT'S THAT'S AND ALLOW THE USE THAT AT THE DISCRETION AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT OF OKAY HOW MUCH OF A ONE TIME RESOURCE WE WANT TO COMMIT MAYBE THAT ONGOING THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO. PLAN ACCORDINGLY. ON THAT. BUT I THINK. I WOULD REITERATE WHAT I SAID EARLIER THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE LC FF AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY ENACTED IN ENVISIONED THE DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND I THINK WITHIN THAT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A FISCAL PICTURE. BUT IT SAY ALSO BUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE AND AND IT'S AN OUTCOME SURE LIKE NOT SOME MEMBER CHAVEZ SPOKE TO EARLIER WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES NOT JUST MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET. YOU KNOW WHAT WHATEVER THE OTHER CASE MAY BE AND I THINK IN LINE WITH THAT WERE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE STRIDES HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE. THE DASHBOARD WE'RE TRYING TO. CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MONITORING PROGRESS ON THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS WE CAN. YOU KNOW WITH THE BUDGET CROSSWALK DOCUMENT CONTINUE TO GIVE. LOCALS MORE. POWER I GUESS YOU COULD SAY OR MORE OF THE OF IT INSIGHT. INTO THAT AND UNDERSTANDING INTO WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK I'LL SEE IF IF IT WENT A LONG WAY IN ENABLING THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT WE'VE HAD THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO WORK OUT THE THE. THE KINKS IF YOU WILL. AND I THINK IN LINE WITH THAT THAT'S WHERE I THINK LOCALS LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS REALLY ARE IN THE BEST POSITION MORE SO THAN US. TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IF I CAN BE TOTALLY HONEST WHERE THEY'RE HAVING THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR A LOCAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEIR STUDENTS THEIR PARENTS THAT THEIR TEACHERS. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING AGAIN THAT WEEK WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH WE CAN ONLY PROVIDE SO MANY RESOURCES WITHIN A FINITE POT. CERTAINLY AGAIN IT'S WITHIN THE PROJECT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ON ALLOCATE THROUGH EXISTING RESOURCES YOU KNOW TO TO. TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE PUT INTEL CFF AND THAT'S THE DISCUSSION OBVIOUSLY WILL WILL HAVE TO BE A PART OF. BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER THAT REALLY YOU KNOW WE WE WE'VE VIEW THAT WERE TAKEN% THE MOST PRUDENT APPROACH THAT WE CAN. GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW THAT IS LIKELY GOING TO BE THE FISCAL OUTLOOK MOVING YEARS FORWARD YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME A LOOMING RECESSION. AND LOCALS REALLY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE YOU KNOW OF MOST PIVOTAL IN THAT SADDAM. DISCUSSION LOT LAST QUESTION. YOU IT EXPRESSED YOUR RELUCTANCE TO SUPPORT. FINDING TARGETS GOING FORWARD. AND YET. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHEN IT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WAS IN FACT THE TOP THE FINDING TARGETS. THAT WE ESTABLISHED IS THAT CORRECT. YES OKAY AND SO AND AND AFFECT THOSE FUNDING TARGETS WORK TO GET. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BACK TO THE. SEVEN OH EIGHT FUNDING LEVEL ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. I BELIEVE ORIGINALLY YES THAT WAS THE. YEAH. SO THERE THERE'S CONCEPTUALLY THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SENDING FINDING TARGETS. RIGHT. YEAH I THINK I WOULD AGREE CONCEPTUALLY TECHNICALLY I'M IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT CAN BE IN THE MINUTES CERTAINLY THERE'S NOTHING INHERENTLY WRONG THERE. IT'S MORE OF THE FISCAL REALITY AND KIND OF YOU KNOW POLITICAL OUTSIDE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AYE AYE YEAH I WANT TO SAY THAT TIGHT I SUPPORT THE. CONCEPT PRESENTED HERE. WITH IS WHETHER WITHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL ACCOMPANYING IT'S. I DO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS HOUSE TO FIT IN WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT. COMPETING INTERESTS CERTAINLY. WE'RE LOOKING AT EASY E. SPECIAL. CT  <u><c.green>AND SO WE HAVE TO</c></u> FIGURE OUT. OTHER PRIORITIES BUT THAT THE NOTION HERE. I THINK AS YOU ALLUDE TO MISTER MARTZ RICHIE IT IS A TARGET AND IT'S A MARKER FOR CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS WHERE WE WANT TO GOT I THINK ONE OF THE. SPEAKERS EARLIER TALKED ABOUT WHAT ELSE IT HEALTHY FF FIRST CAME OUT BEFORE I WAS HERE IT IS YOUR FIRST TERM. YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE EQUITY ISSUE MAKING SURE WE SCHOOL FUNDING IS EQUITABLE AND OF COURSE THE LOCAL CONTROL CONCEPT BUT IT DIDN'T ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE ADEQUACY OF FUNDING AS WE HEARD AT OUR FIRST HEARING FROM. SUPERINTENDENT TOILETS AND THEY WERE INCREASED SCHOOL FUNDING. BY RECORD AMOUNTS TO LAST FIVE YEARS AND WE'RE STILL FORTY SECONDS OR FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL FUNDING. SO WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO. CERTAINLY MONEY ISN'T THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING WITHOUT THE WORK ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AS WELL BUT. MORE RESOURCES ARE A KEY ELEMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NEEDS AS OUR SUPERINTENDENTS. OUTLINED EARLIER BUT I THINK THIS. WILL ENABLE US TO TO PRIORITIZE AND ALSO PUT A MARKER DOWN THE ROAD SO WILL WE WILL EVALUATE THIS IN THE IN THE TOTALITY. OF OF THE ISSUE. BEFORE THE AT. THE FINALITY OF THE BUDGET AFTER THE MAY REVISE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE I OPEN OF COURSE. ARE NEXT TO A PROPOSAL WE WANT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS FORMING STUDENT GROUP. THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AGAIN. A LA. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BERMAN OF ED GIVE US THAT AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL ON OUT AND ALLOW THE PUBLIC INCLUDING OUR COLLEAGUE. AT DOCTOR WEBER TO PRATT PRESENT TO US AS WELL. YES PROPOSAL THAT IS MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA WOULD EXPAND THAT ON DUPLICATED COUNT TO INCLUDE THE% STERN SUBGROUP. WHO PERFORMED? LOWEST ON STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS IN CALIFORNIA EXEMPTING THOSE GROUPS THAT ALREADY BENEFIT FROM SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING EITHER IN LC A FAST OR THROUGH OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS. ARE IN STANDING OF THE LATEST DATA ON SOON OUTCOMES IS THAT THE SUB GROUP THAT WOULD BE ADDED TO THE ON TO PLACATE ACCOUNT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. THEY GIVE. BUT AGAIN AT THIS POINT WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAVE NO OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE DUB THAT LEGISLATION AND REALLY BUG THE CONCEPT I'M AND WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD. A CHANCE TO TO DO THE FULL APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS OF PROPOSAL AS WELL TO BE ABLE TO OPINE. DEBORAH BROWN ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TRUCKS AND WE TWO HAVE NOT TAKEN A PROPOSED THAT POSITION ON THIS PROPOSAL YET WE'RE STILL I AM. REVIEWING IT IN IN DETAIL BUT I DO AGREE WITH THE INTENT AND THE MOTIVATION BEHIND IT WHICH IS REALLY HOW DO WE. TARGET READS IF IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS HAD WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TARGETING A RESOURCES TO I'M OUR HIGHEST NEED STUDENTS. OKAY. WELL NOW ALLOW. PUBLIC COMMENT SO WE CAN HAVE A OF A LINE UP AND WILL ALLOW COURSE OUR COLLEAGUE DOT TO EVERYDAY COME UP HERE AND JOIN US AT THE TABLE. THANK YOU. MET MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE BUDGET PROPOSAL TO TACKLE A FLAW THAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. SINCE IT WAS INSTITUTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND EFFORT TO TARGET RESOURCES TO THE HIGHEST NEED STUDENTS IN STATE. I THINK THE THREE OF US WHO WERE HERE WHEN WE AND FOUGHT FOR LC FF IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND MISTER MURATSUCHI AND MISTER CHAVEZ AND I BOTH KNOW THAT UP IT WAS A VALIANT EFFORT TO START TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE THOUGHT WE HAD IDENTIFIED THE CATEGORIES THAT WOULD INCLUDE EVERYONE IN THAT. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE L. CFF IS ALWAYS SEEN AS A LIVING DOCUMENT A LIVING PROCESS. THAT WHEN WE. THAT IT'S NOT SET IN STONE BUT IT IS A BILL AND HAS THE ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE TO HELP US TO MEET THE GOALS WE SET FOR OURSELVES. AS WE DESCRIBED EARLIER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FOR MY CONSIST OF A BASE GRANT CONCENTRATION GRANTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS. A MY PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE A NEW SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT GOING FORWARD FOR THE LOWEST PERFORMING GROUP. STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND AND AND AT THIS POINT THAT GROUP IS A AFRICAN AMERICANS BUT WOULD APPLY TO ANYONE ANY GROUP THAT'S THE IF WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE GROUP. TWENTY SEVENTEEN EXPECTED SCORES CONFIRM A DISTURBING FACT THAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED FOR YEARS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF INCOME ARE PERFORMING BELOW THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE IN BOTH ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH. ONLY THIRTY ONE PERCENT OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS THEY ADMIT STANDARDS AND ONLY NINETEEN PERCENT MET THE MAMAK. OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDY THAT THE MOST OF YOU PROBABLY SAME DONE DONE BY UC BERKELEY ON ON HOW THE CENTRALIZING SCHOOL FINANCE MAY NARROW ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. UNEVEN PROGRESS IN CALIFORNIA AFTER FORTY ONE BILLION BY BROUGH BY FULLER AND LEAD. FOUND THAT THE SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS RECEIVING CONCENTRATION GRANTS DOING THE INITIAL TWO YEARS OF LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA DIDN'T GAUGING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE THAT PARALLELS GAINS IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. COMPARED WITH SCHOOLS IN ALMOST IDENTICAL DISTRICTS NOT RECEIVING CONCENTRATION GRANTS THESE BENEFITS WERE LARGELY EXPERIENCE BY LATINO STUDENTS AND NOT BY OTHER GROUPS AS SIGNIFICANT LEVELS BUT THEY ALSO NOTE THAT THERE THAT QUOTE THE INABILITY TO DETECT GAINS FOR BLACK STUDENTS IS WORTH SOME. THESE EARLY FINDINGS SUGGEST% THAT WHAT ELSE CFF SUPPLEMENTS MAY BE IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR LATINO STUDENTS AS INTENDED A NOTABLE GAP REMAINS FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN THE STATE PUT IN SIXTY THOUSAND ARE RECEIVING A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW INCOME. ELL A HOMELESS OF FOSTER KIDS HOWEVER THERE IS A SUBGROUP OF ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND STUDENTS WOULD NOT RECEIVING A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. AND NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND SUPPORT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THIS IS THE ONLY GROUP OF STUDENTS PERFORMING BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE THAT ARE NOT ALREADY RECEIVING SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS. BASED ON TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIGURES WE ESTIMATE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE EL IS NEEDED TO IN RESOURCES FOR TARGETED STUDENTS AND ASSISTANCE. THE FIGURE INCLUDE BUT ARE BOTH SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION TO AND FUNDING USING EXISTING LCF A FORMULA. WITH THREE HUNDRED EIGHT THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION IN NEW. PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING THIS YEAR NOW'S THE TIME TO FIX IS EDUCATIONAL IN EQUITY IN FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO TARGET RESOURCES TO STUDENTS THAT ARE MOST IN NEED. AS WITH OTHER LCF A FUNDS DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS WHAT STATE WHAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND SERVICES THEY WILL BE OFFERING HIGH NEED STUDENTS IN OTHER. IN THEIR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN THIS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSURANCE THAT THE NEW FUNDING WILL BE TARGET FOR LOCALLY LOCALLY DETERMINED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PUPILS. ALSO THE GOVERNOR'S OF BUDGET OF TALKED ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THINK WE SAW THAT EL OF THE LA ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT IS PUT FORTH BY THE GOVERNOR. WILL ALSO A LOOKING ACCOUNTABILITY AND BE WE HAVE WE'RE PROPOSING SOME LANGUAGE THAT WE WILL BE SEEING FAIRLY SOON TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ACCOUNTABILITY. MOST OF US WHO WORKED ON THE LC FF IN TWENTY THIRTEEN KNOW THAT WE WILL BE SURE THAT THAT BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE THOSE DOLLARS WENT WITH A SUPPOSED TO GO. AND THAT WE CAN TRACK IT AND BASICALLY SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN OUR SCHOOLS. WE ARE NOW PROPOSING SOME ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES YOU SHOULD REALLY BE RECEIVING FAIRLY SEWN TO THIS COMMITTEE TO MEET THAT NEED THE GOVERNOR'S FINALLY SAID WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY. A AS AS AS HE'S GOING OUT THE DOOR HE SAYINGS FILING WITH UNDER SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. HE HAD PROPOSED SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT ADEQUATE THAT MANY FOLKS PERSPECTIVE AND YOU WE WILL BE SHARING WITH YOU A AND AN ACCOUNTABILITY DOCUMENT. THAT CAN BE USED IN THE BUDGET THAT BEEN WOULD REQUIRE THOSE DOLLARS TO BE TRACK. I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TO PRESENT AT CONCERNING THIS PROPOSAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE OF THE IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF THE. A CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS IN TERMS OF BUDGET ASK THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF WITH CHANGING AND EXPANDING LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT ARE. YOU KNOW I THINK AROUND I THINK SO LARA FLYNN QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TIME OH YEAH YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JEFF AKA REPRESENTING RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. I WON'T BREAK THE RULES BY MENTIONING A BILL NUMBER THAT WE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER HAS DOCTOR WEBER HAS IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE THAT IS DEFINITELY. WORTHY OF FURTHER CONVERSATION. AS OUR COUNTY OFFICES WORKING WITH OUR DISTRICTS TO DO A DEEP DIVE INTO THEIR STUDENT PERFORMANCE DATA. THEY ARE FINDING THAT THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES WHERE THE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED FALL OUTSIDE OF THE CATEGORIES THAT GENERALLY GENERATE A SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING. THAT WOULD PROVIDE INCREASED PROGRAMS SO WE WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT. THE METHOD BY WHICH WE IDENTIFY THOSE SUBGROUPS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. WHERE THOSE PROBLEMS ARE AT EACH DISTRICT WHICH MAY BE AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS BUT IT MAY VERY VERY WELL BE ANOTHER GROUP OF STUDENTS SUCH AS FOSTER YOUTH? SO. WHERE THE CONVERSATION AND WE THANK DOCTOR WEBER FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD CAN THINK YOU? TERRY MEMBERS BRAD STRONG CHILDREN NOW. SOME DISTRICTS LIKE OAKLAND OR MAKING CONCERTED EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS PROGRAMS NEEDS OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. THE MY WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA LANCET OUT CAN AMERICAN EDUCATORS IN AND OUT SO A BLACK EDUCATION NETWORK HAS MADE IT CLEAR TO ME THAT SUCH EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF OUR LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUPS ARE FAR FROM. OUR FOR OUR FOR A FAR THE EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE THEM WE WE SUPPORT THE ADDITION OF THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP I'M TO ADDRESS THE DECADES OF UNREALIZED. POTENTIAL. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARGARET FORTUNE ON THE C. E. O. FORTUNE SCHOOL WHICH IS A NETWORK OF TUITION FREE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS. LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO AND SAN BERNADINO. WE ARE REGIONAL INITIATIVES TO CLOSE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. BECAUSE OF THE PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN ALL THIRTEEN OF THE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I'M RELATED TO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. WHO LIKE GOD AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL AT THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP OUTSIDE OF STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS? WE ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. I WANT TO MAKE A FEW. HIGHLIGHTS TO THE PROPOSAL. ONE OF THE CRITICS OF THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN. THAT IT WOULD CREATE A PERVERSE INCENTIVE. IT TO A INTENTIONALLY HAVE STUDENTS UNDERPERFORM IN ORDER TO GET THE RESOURCES. AM I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT WE THAT I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE. OKAY THAT WERE THE CASE IN THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE REASON FOR HAVING SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS FOR ANY SUBGROUP OF STUDENTS. AND JUST TO MAKE SURE THIS PROPOSAL. UP WOULD HAVE THE INITIAL SUBGROUP IT'S IDENTIFIED FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR CONTINUE TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNTIL THEIR PERFORMANCE. MATCHES MATCHES THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HIGHEST PERFORMING SUB GROUP SO THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT. AT HAVING A DISINCENTIVE TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THIS BILL ACTUALLY PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS BILL IDENTIFIES STUDENTS NOT BY THEIR SUBGROUP. BUT BY THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. I THINK THAT. AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS HAVE HAVE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF INVISIBILITY. WE'RE AT HAS BEEN HANDS OFF IN TERMS OF PUBLIC POLICY SPECIFICALLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN THE CALCIFIED. STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AT THE BOTTOM FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT AHEAD ON. SO WE IN THURSDAY ASK WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL. I WANNA KNOW THE FOURTEEN SCHOOL IS ONE OF TWELVE SCHOOLS IN THE STATE THAT IS MEANT IN THE THAT SERVES A MAJORITY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. THAT IS IN THE TOP HALF OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN THE STATE. AND THE TOP TEN PERCENT WHEN COMPARED TO SIMILAR SCHOOLS. SO WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS WORK AND THEIR OTHER SCHOOLS AROUND THE STATE TO NOTICE HOW TO DO THIS WORK AND WE WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPREAD THOSE PACKED PRACTICES. RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL THROUGH THE AL CAPP PROCESS THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND REMIND PEOPLE I ONE MINUTE PLEASE I DID GIVE. A MISFORTUNE WERE TIME KNOWING THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US TODAY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM MEMBERS PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST WOULD LIKE TO THANK DOCTOR WEBER FOR HER EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS A TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE L. LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WATCHING. AND ADMIRING AND. IN THAT VEIN OUR BOARD AND SUPERINTENDENT STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WE KNOW THAT WHEN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FIRST CAME INTO BEING ONE OF THE GOALS WAS TO LIFT ALL BOATS. AND WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANY CHILDREN BEHIND AND WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS OR ANY STUDENTS APPLICABLE SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED AS LOW PERFORMING. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL AND THE FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU THANK YOU. THAT'S MYERS CALIFORNIA SQUARE ASSOCIATION ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL. JUSTIN THE PRIOR CONVERSATION WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT IN LCF AFTER THIS IS ONE THING WE THINK IS NEXUS IS ADDRESSING. PARTICULAR GROUPS OF STUDENTS THAT ARE MISSING OUT ON THE BENEFIT OF THE TARGETING OF EXTRA FUNDING AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT. STUDENTS WHO ARE ARE NOT ACHIEVING AT WHERE THEY SHOULD BE AND HELPS US TO STEER. A SEMESTER RESOURCES DOT TO THE STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE START AS WE SAID YOU KNOW JUST WITH THAT MS GIBBS IS LIFTING ALL BOATS WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT. IN WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT IT HOPE THAT THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS ALONG THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIAN REVERSE SOME BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK DOCTOR WEBER HAS PERHAPS UNCOVERED. A BLIND SPOT IN IT'LL CFF BY IDENTIFYING A GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT DOING WELL IN WOULD DO BETTER ACCORDING TO RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE IF WE ADDED THEM TO THE CATEGORY. QUALIFYING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS GROUP'S NEEDS AND GIVE THEM ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION. AND THE EL CAP PROCESS AND FINALLY PERHAPS HOUSE IMPORTANT IS THIS INDIVIDUAL PROPOSAL WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES WHY IS IT. THAT ONE GROUP CONSISTENTLY COMES OUT ON THE BOTTOM I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET BRIEFED ON THAT DATA PULLED TOGETHER BY THE PROPONENTS. IT'S VERY COMPELLING BUT PERHAPS AS IMPORTANT AS THIS INDIVIDUAL PROPOSAL WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT'S HAPPENING SYSTEMICALLY TO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I'M CALLING MILLER WITH CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION AND CCS A STRONGLY SUPPORTS TARGETING FUNDS TO THE MOST HIGH NEED STUDENTS TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY FOR ALL STUDENTS. A DOCTOR WORKERS PROPOSAL ACTUALLY WOULD CORRECT OF A CLEAR. FLAW IN THE LC FF WHICH IS INTENDED OF COURSE TO. TO TARGET THE. RESOURCES TO THE MOST HIGH NEED STUDENTS AND THIS GROUP OF THE. THE LOWEST PERFORMINGSEPARATE PISTONS THERE'S ABSOLUTE GAP IN THE DATA IS UNDISPUTED BALL THAT THE STUDENTS ARE IN NEED OF SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORTS. JEFF UP BASED FUNDING IS INSUFFICIENT FOR ALL SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS. BUT. FULL FUNDING THIS YEAR WILL WILL PROVIDE A PRETTY STRONG INCREASE IN THE BASE FOR UP FOR ALL. AND WAS SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN PROP NINETY EIGHT OVERALL THIS YEAR WEAKER AS THE COMMITTEE TO ALSO PRIORITIZE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO TRULY MEET THIS CALL OF EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. ENVISIONED BY THE ALSO FF AND CLOSES PERSISTENT YOU MAKE OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS SEAN THE MORE AND I'M WITH FORTUNE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION I STRONGLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR WAIVERS PROPOSAL TO CLOSE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT GAP. ARM WHICH IS THE LOVE OF THE LOWEST PERFORMANCE THAT GROUPS OF STUDENTS STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS BY ADDING THEM TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. GOOD MORNING MICHELLE MCANDREW IT ON BEHALF OF THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT VERY SUPPORTIVE OF DOCTOR WEBBER'S PROPOSAL IN THIS CONVERSATION YOU MAY NOTE THAT WE HAVE A SPECIFIC. OFFICE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE ACHIEVEMENT UP FIRST IN THE NATION SO WE ARE VERY FOCUSED. ON THAT THE STUDENT POPULATION AND APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE STUDENTS TO. SUPPORT THEIR SUCCESS AND THANK YOU. JENNIFER BAKER AT THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE A WATCH ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. IMPORTANT IS THE CONTEXT IN THE METHODOLOGIES THAT WHERE YOU SEEN WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AND EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO SPECIFY WHICH WOULD FUNDING GOES TO WHICH STUDENTS BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES OF STUDENTS INCLUDING SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS WERE WE ALSO HAVE SYSTEMIC PROGRAMS. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THIS TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER STUDENTS SUCH AS NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS OR OTHERS THAT ARE IN LOWER PERFORMING. STUDENTS ANOTHER SUBGROUP SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE. ALL STUDENTS ARE SUCCEEDING WHILE WE'RE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WERE CAPTURING STUDENTS THAT NEED MORE ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ET DELUDE SEE WITH THAT VOICE IT I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT THE EARLIER COMMENT YOU JUST HEARD BECAUSE I DON'T THINK. THE WAY THIS IS PROPOSALS DRAFTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LOWER PERFORMING SUB. WHOLE POINT IS THIS IS A LOW WORST PERFORMING SUBGROUP AND IT'S TIME TO QUIT BEING DATED DENIERS AYE THE DATE IN FRONT OF YOU. IT'S DESPICABLE. AND THERE'S IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND WHETHER IT'S THIS. GROUP AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL ARE DOWN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL EACH INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT THEY'LL CAP SHOULD BE INTENTIONALLY PROGRAMMING DOLLARS TO ADDRESS. THESE KINDS OF INEQUITIES IN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION. SHOOTING. THE AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APOLOGIZE ABOUT NOT ALSO MAKING EARLIER TO THE. LCF F. DISCUSSION I DO APPRECIATE DOT WEBER FOR BRINGING THIS. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FORWARD. MYSELF MR SICHUAN THIS COMMITTEE BACK WHEN ELSE IF FAST AND AND OUR OUR CHAIRWOMAN IS IN THE AUDIENCE TERM OF BENICIA. AYE WHEN WE HAD OUR YOU KNOW SHIRLEY VIGOROUS AND MISTER CHAVEZ IS ON THE COMMITTEE BACK THEN TO WE HAD A. YOU KNOW A LOT OF LOT OF DEBATE LOT OF. BACK AND FORTH BUT I THINK EVERYBODY. FULLY EMBRACE THE GOALS OF BRINGING OUR HAVING A FOCUS ON. GROUPS THAT HAD REALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND. AND THAT THAT'S WHY BILLY APPRECIATE. DOCKWORKERS PROPOSAL I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE. ARE LOOKING OUT THE FULL FUNDING OF AL CFF WHAT ELSE GOES ALONG WITH IT AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT. WHETHER OR NOT AFTER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY ON TO MAKE THE KIND OF PROGRESS IN THE VARIOUS AREAS. THAT WE'D WE'D HOPED AND I THINK IT'S ALSO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT AT THE AT THIS TIME AS WE IMPLEMENT A HEALTH EFFECT THAT WE ALSO HAVE. FULL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR TRANSPARENCY MEASURES I YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR MORE ACCOUNTABILITY MORE TRANSPARENCY ONLY ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT. TELL ALL CF GRAPH IS FULLY FUNDED WILL THIS IS THE YEAR THAT FULLY FUNDED IS BEING FULL FUNDING OF AUSSIE THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED. SO WE ABSOLUTELY EXPECT THAT WE WILL HAVE DIED NO FULL FUNDING WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. FULLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR OVER THIS LAST A COUPLE YEARS. SO THAT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. AGAIN DOCTOR WEBER KEEPING HER EYES ON THE PRIZE AND STAYING VERY FOCUSED ON OUR CHILDREN AND MAKING SURE. THAT. IF THERE ARE KIDS THAT ARE BEING THE PRINT THAT WE FIND WAYS TO KIND OF BRING BRING THEM UP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SMART. HEATH RAISING YOUR HAND NOW TRIAL YES YES OKAY AYE AYE IT'S OF A QUESTION. I GUESS IS FOR DOCTOR WEBER BUT. HOW IS? SUB GROUP DEFINED. WELL I THINK. I THINK WE'VE HAD SOME FEDERALLY DEFINED SUBGROUPS BASED ON ETHNICITY AT WHICH IN OTHER WORDS WE'VE IDENTIFIED ALREADY TALKED AFRICAN AMERICANS AND. HISPANICS API YOU KNOW SO THAT'S HOW WE COLLECT THAT DATA WHEN WE DISAGGREGATED DATA WE DISAGGREGATED BASED ON WHAT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IDENTIFIES AS THAT THAT'S SUB GROUPS THEMSELVES. ARE GENERALLY I GUESS THEY LOOK AT CULTURAL IDENTITY SO FORTH AND SO ON AS THE AS THE DEFECATION A PICKUP GROUPS. SO DO THE. THE END. UP THERE THE. CTA. MENTIONED SPECIAL EDUCATION IS SPECIAL EDUCATION. INCLUDED AS A POTENTIAL SUBGROUP. I THINK WE'VE GOT A WE'VE MENTIONED THE FACT THAT WE THIS WOULD NOT SAID THIS WOULD IT WE WERE LOOKING AT THE SUBGROUPS TAKING OUT SPECIAL LITTLE IN TERMS OF SUBGROUPS BECAUSE. THEY'RE SPECIAL KINDS OF THINGS WE DO IN SPECIAL ED THAT OF A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND WHAT WE DO IN REGULAR ED IN TERMS OF FUNDING. AND THAT CLEARLY WE DO NOT FUND SPECIAL THAT ENOUGH. AND ALL AND MOST OF US RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THAT AND WE HAVE FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS STATE REQUIREMENTS REGARDING. THE FUNDING OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SO IS SUB GROUP DIDN'T MIND IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN BY RACE OR ETHNICITY. AB WELL I AM SURE THAT MANY WAYS THAT WE LOOK AT SUB GROUPS AND IN THE END NOT IN TERMS TO LOOK AT LOOK AT GENDER. OF MALE FEMALE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT AREAS OF MOST FOLKS WHEN THEY DISAGGREGATED DATA DISAGGREGATED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES WHEN WE LOOK AT US STEM EDUCATION. WE NOT ONLY DO IT BASED ON GENDER BUT WE ALSO DO IT BASED ON ETHNICITIES OF THAT OF THEIR SOUL OUT WE LOOK TO SEE WITH THEIR DISPARITIES AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES SENSE THAT DOM. WE HAVE A WHOLE OF A GENDER ISSUE THAT WE PUT INTO THE CATEGORIES SOMETIME TO THE AREA OF MATH AND SCIENCE WE DO. BUT OFTENTIMES WE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA IT THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY THAT THIS IS A. THIS IS A SUB GROUP IT NEEDS A FOCUS OF WHAT WE DID WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WAS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY RECEIVED INFORMATION. A LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE REGARDING WHAT THE VARIOUS. ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ARE IN OUR IT CODE IDENTIFIES ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AS WELL IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF NOT GAPS BUT IDENTIFIES THE CATEGORIES THAT OF THE YEAR. THEY CAN BE ETHNIC GROUPS THAT CAN BE SO SO ECONOMIC THEY CAN BE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ALL THOSE THINGS WE IDENTIFIED. A MOST OF YOU KNOW WOOD BEGAN WITH THOUGH THE LC OF PFAFF WE. WE ENDED UP WITH THESE GROUPS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT GROUPS THAT SHOWED A A DISPARITY IN TERMS OF ACHIEVEMENT AND THEY GENERALLY WORK ITS WILL FOSTER CARE. ARE KIDS WHO ARE HOMELESS OF BECAUSE OF THE SOCIO ECONOMIC SITUATIONS WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES BUT WE ALSO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS ETHNICITIES AS WELL WE ALSO LOOK INTO ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BECAUSE THAT WAS A PART OF IT. YOU REMEMBER ORIGINALLY THIS LC FF DID NOT TALK BUT ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. BUT TALK ABOUT ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. AND IF WE KEPT THAT LANGUAGE WE PRIDE WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THIS LOWEST ACHIEVING GROUP THAT DOES NOT FALL INTO ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BUT DOES FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. I APPRECIATE ALL THAT BIG AGAIN MY QUESTION WAS IS. SO STUDENTS ENGLISH LEARNERS PUPILS WITH DISABILITIES FOSTER YOUTH AND HOMELESS YOU. OKAY AND WE ALSO AS I SAID SOMETIMES LOOK AT SUB GROUPS BASED ON GENDER. MEN THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE ADDED ALSO SO BOTH OF THE SUBGROUPS. WELL THANK YOU I I HAVE A FEW A QUESTIONS AS WELL AND AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE BETWEEN POLICY AND BUDGET AND SO IS THE BUDGET THAT. HAD ON AYE I THINK THIS IS A WORTHY. UP PROPOSAL IT I THINK AS YOU AS WAS ALLUDED TO DROP BY YOU AND AND ART TO US SPEAKERS THAT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE WE MAY MISS WHEN ELSE IF THAT WAS CREATED AND AND I THINK YOU KNOW E NEED TO TAKE A LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE SO I THINK. TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING HERE IT'S THE SOMETHING THAT I CERTAINLY. A SUPPORT AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS WHEN WHEN WE GO AND FEEL THAT LOGISTICS A LEGISLATION THAT AND THE OTHER COMMITTEE OF COURSE BUT THAT'S WHEN I BRING UP TO TWO ISSUES. ONE AS FAR AS THE SUBGROUP. AND I I THINK IF YOU IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT THAT THAT. THE HANDOUT I THINK THAT THE LASSEN AND I'M. THE LAST SPEAKER GIVE US WHEN WE LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE. THE THE ASIAN SUBGROUPS SCORE VERY HIGH BUT ASIAN A FEW DISAGGREGATED ASIAN. LOT OF LOT LOT OF A. VARIETY THERE AND SO I KNOW IN MY FOR EXAMPLE. ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN SPECIMEN FORMER CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT THAT LARGE API POPULATION AND. PRIMARILY SOUTHEAST ASIAN VIETNAMESE MONG MANH LAOTIAN. AND THAT THIS SUBGROUP VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT THAT ASIAN SUB GROUP AS A WHOLE AND SO. HE WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT WE COULD THIS PROPOSAL LOOK AT. THE SUBGROUP WITHIN THE SUBGROUP ON US ON THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY THERE BUT BUT POTENTIALLY DIS AGGREGATE SOME OF THE AND THE ETHNIC CATEGORIES IN IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I I VENTURE TO SAY THAT MAYBE THERE ARE SOME SCHOOLS THAT. THAT ARE ARE VERY SIMILAR. IN THAT. IT WAS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT I WHEN I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD IN SAN DIEGO THE WHICH HAS A LARGE API COMMUNITY. WE DID DISAGGREGATED DATA. AND WE FOUND OF COURSE THAT ARE AMONG. AT THE HEAD LOW ACHIEVEMENT IN SOME OF THE GROUPS THAT MAY BE SMALL BUT THEY HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS NOT YOU REMEMBER. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS I THINK THOUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA HAS BEEN TRYING TO DISAGGREGATED DATA. TO THE OPPOSITION OF THE API COMMUNITY THAT DID NOT WANT THE DISAGGREGATED DATA. SOME OF SOME OF THEM MAY BUT WAS REALLY OF YOU KNOW AND I SPOKE IN FAVOR OF IT BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE. THAT ALL SOMETIMES GROUPS OF OF OF OUR. I CAN'T GUARDS CATEGORIZE VERY LARGE AND AS A RESULT YOU MISS SOME GROUPS OF OVERUSE AT ANNA AND THIS WOULD NOT PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING THIS WOULD NOT PREVENT IT FROM. FROM BASICALLY GETTING DOWN TO IF WE IF WE HAVE DISCOVERED A GROUP THAT IS REALLY PERSISTENTLY A LOW ACHIEVING GROUP THAT WE HAVE DIDN'T MEET BEEN THAT'S WHAT ELSE HE UP UP WAS ABOUT TO GO GET THOSE GROUPS BECAUSE. CLEARLY ABA A WE WANT EVERY STUDENT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN AND IF THEY'RE IN A SPECIALIZED VERY LOW SUB GROUP THAT'S THERE THAT'S PERSISTENTLY LOW WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE'VE HAD THIS CHALLENGE IN THIS CONVERSATION AMONG WHAT WE CONSIDER AFRICAN INDIGENOUS INDIVIDUALS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS. AND OFTENTIMES THE AFTER THAT CATEGORY AFRICAN AMERICAN HIDES A LOT OF FAILURE IN AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY VERSUS THOSE WHO COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND IN SAN DIEGO WE HAVE A LARGE OUT IMMIGRANT POPULATION OF AFRICANS. AND WE HAD TO DISAGGREGATED DATA IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE REALLY MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND OFTENTIMES THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAD BEEN HERE. ALL THEIR LIVES WHO BORNEO AFRICAN AMERICANS WEIRD ACHIEVING LOWER THAN STUDENTS WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED HERE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN GOT THE BENEFIT OF HAVING SOME BILINGUAL EDUCATION MONEY. AS WELL AS SOME OF THE KINDS OF THINGS AND SO I I'VE NEVER BEEN OPPOSED US DISAGGREGATED DATA TO GET TO WHERE. YOU'VE WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS A GROUP THAT'S UNFAIRLY THAT WOULD NOT MEETING THEIR NEEDS YES WE NEED TO DO THAT WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT THAT THAT DATA. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IF WE GO DOWN THIS. THIS PATH AND AND DO THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO STICK CENTER IS IS TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE ADDRESS. THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE AND I JUST WANT TO ASK FOR. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OFFERED THE PART OF EDUCATION I KNOW YOU YOU YOU YOU MAKE YOUR STATEMENT EARLIER I DON'T PRETEND TO PIN YOU DOWN THAT BUT. BUT IF THERE WAS A WILL FROM THAT COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO DO THIS DODD DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S ONE. THAT IT'S UP THAT WE COULD THAT THIS OR THAT WE COULD DO IT THAT IS A PRACTICAL WAY TO DO IT AND THAT THEY'RE WITH THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THE. LEGAL STRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE REYES PROP TWO NIGTS A FOR THAT WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS. WHAT WOULD THAT BE LAWFUL? I AM. HONESTLY IT AT THIS POINT. I I DON'T THINK THAT WE AS FINANCE OF HAVE ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH. DEPARTMENT AND TALK ABOUT THE THAT PRACTICABILITY. OF IT I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY MULTIPLE WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO ABOUT IT I MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE BILL AS WRITTEN AND I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES THERE BUT AGAIN HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THAT ANNOUNCES ENOUGH THE. DEPARTMENT OF ED MAY BE ABLE TO A PINE WITH SOME MORE DETAILS OKAY DEPARTMENT OF THAT. BUT YEAH I CAN TAKE IN A PINE WAS SIMPLY HE TELLS BUT ABOUT IT BUT I THINK WE AS WE'VE REVIEWED IT WE DO HAVE SOME SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THAT I THINK IF THERE IS A WILL TO MOVE FORWARD THEN WE WOULD BE HAPPY. TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION ON HOW TO MAKE IT HOW TO HOW TO MAKE IT WORK. OKAY WELL I WOULD ASK YOU THE TO TO WORK WITH OUR. OUR COMMITTEE STAFF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN. PURSUING AS WE GO FORTH THIS YEAR. MR MARTZ WHICH IF I CAN ASK ONE. LAST FOLLOW UP QUESTION SO. IF THE DATA SHOW THAT. THE MONK STUDENT POPULATION AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WAS THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP. YOUR BILL WOULD APPLY IT WOULD APPLY TO ANY THAT ANY ONE OF THE LOWEST SUBGROUPS HISTORY. YEAH IT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T THIS BILL BUSINESS CONCEPT DOESN'T SAY AFRICAN AMERICANS IT SAVES THE LOWEST. OF SUBGROUP THAT SEVERE AND AN AT AND IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL. AND WE MOVE THAT LAWYERS COME UP WHATEVER BECOMES ADMITS LUIS GROUP MEETS THE FOCUS AND ATTENTION YES. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN.

BUT A CENTRAL TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS THIS REQUIRES COUNTY'S DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS TO CONSIDER FIVE PILLARS OF ENGAGEMENT. REPRESENTATION TRANSPARENCY SUSTAINABILITY COLLABORATION AND ALIGNMENT. THESE ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN OUR MATERIALS WHICH I WILL SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE ELECTRONICALLY WITHOUT ADHERENCE TO THESE FIVE PILLARS THE PROCESS ITSELF CAN HINDER DECISION MAKING AND ULTIMATELY. OBSTRUCTED COMMUNITIES POTENTIAL TO PROTECT VALUABLE AND EFFECTIVE RESOURCES SERVING ESPECIALLY ITS MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. IT IS FROM THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE APPRECIATE THE TRULY GROUNDBREAKING PROMISE ESPECIALLY FOR ISSUES OF EQUITY THAT THE L. CUT PROCESS CAN PROVIDE A COMMUNITY. THE COMMITTEES RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE AND COST OF MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WORK AS EXHIBITED BY THIS PROPOSAL. BY THIS PROPOSAL IS COMMENDABLE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PROVIDE SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. SHARON MEMBERS PROUD STRONG WITH CHILDREN NOW WE SUPPORT A REQUEST FOR THE FUN AND FOR THAT ONE TIME FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT GRANTS. AND THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS. THE.

AND I KNOW THAT MY CITY IS STRUGGLING IS TO REACH OUT TO THE ASIAN COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY MOMENT ALLOW COMMUNITY SO IN SACRAMENTO HAVE LARGER POPULATION AND THEY'RE ALSO STRUGGLE THE SAME THING. SO FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE WANT TO TO DO OF YOUR BEST TO REALLY REINFORCE AND LOCAL DISTRICTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO THEIR THEIR JOB RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. I GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS PATRICK MORE TEAR WITH COUNSEL FOR A STRONG AMERICA. AND WE SUPPORT. THE PROPOSAL FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT BLOCK GRANTS. WE FIND THAT POSITIVE SCHOOL CLIMATE IS CRITICAL TO THE STUDENT SUCCESS. AND DESPITE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF DISTRICTS WERE DESPITE THAT TWENTY PERCENT DISTRICTS. ARE DOING ANNUAL STUDENT CLEMENTS SERVICE NOW. DESPITE THE EXPECTATION OF ANNUAL STUDENT SURVEYS NAILS IF OF STATUTE. FOR SEVEN HUNDRED PLUS DISTRICTS. WE FIND THAT LESS THAN A QUARTER OF THE FIFTY LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHOSE ALL CAPS REVIEWED ARE DOING SURVEYS OF ALL THREE GROUPS STUDENTS PARENTS AND STAFF. AND SO. INTERN WE SUPPORT PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING WHISKEY AND WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES UMP THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FOR. LEADING ON THIS. WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THE. ASSESSMENT OF SCHOOL CLIMATE. FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS STUDENTS PARENTS TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AND STAFF IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING. AND THE ABILITY THE CAPACITY FOR ENGAGEMENT WHICH WE THINK IS THE UNDERPINNING OF LOCAL CONTROL LCF HALF. WE ARE MODELING WHAT WE MEAN BY INCLUSIVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS BILL. THIS LEGISLATION EXCUSE ME THIS PROPOSAL AND. WE WANT TO INCLUDE ALL STAKEHOLDERS OUT IN THAT CONVERSATION WHILE WE AGREE THAT THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO BE LOOKING AT EXPANDING THIS CAPACITY. WE ALSO THINK THAT. ELEAZAR COUNTIES ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS THAT ARE WORKING ON THIS THAT HAVE THIS OBLIGATION NOW NEED TO BE SUPPORTED NOW THANK YOU FOR THE INVESTMENT THANK YOU. HELLO I'M. MIAMI SLIGHTLY BEST. I LIVE IN THE COUNTY OVER SAN. AND I HAVE TICKETS AND LIVINGSTON HIGH SCHOOL. AND I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT. MY KIDS THE CURRENT ONE OF THEN THERE HE'S SO BEHIND OF SCHOOL AND I SUPPORT THAT CLAIM MEET SCHOOL. BECAUSE ON. I DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN TO THE OTHER KIDS LIKE HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I DIDN'T GET A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THAT THE SCHOOL. SO I DIDN'T FINISH MY IN HIGH SCHOOL SO I HOPE MY IS MY SON HE'S AND NINTH GRADE I HOPE YOU FINISH THE SCHOOL AND. THE. HELLO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US INTO YOUR SPACE MY NAME IS AUTUMN MARTINEZ I MUST TELL FOR YOUTH CONNECTION. I WORK FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY OFFICE AND SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE WE CONSISTS OF CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND I WORK WITH YOUNG. STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOLS ARE CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOU TO IDENTIFY THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND REGARDS THE LC FF AND. THE BUDGET AND IT'S SUCH A POWERFUL MOVEMENT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND COLLABORATING WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF ME AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH TO SUPPORT ON ON HAND SUPPORT THAT. REALLY AND POWER THE YOU TO IDENTIFY WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT IT IS THAT THEY NEED ON SO THEY CAN ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES SO THIS PROPOSAL WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTER AND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JENNIFER BAKER CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE ALSO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS CENTER CITY COUNCIL MEETING. THOUGHT THIS PAST WEEKEND WE BROUGH PRESHEAF THIS CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. YES MISTER JARVIS. I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AS YOU KNOW I HAVE A. AN ISSUE LIKE THIS ALREADY TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY EIGHT TALK ABOUT PARENTAL AND FAMILY INVOLVEMENT. BUT THERE'S THIS IS A BUDGET MEETINGS OF WHAT YOUR INTENTION HOW MUCH ARE YOU LOOKING FOR. DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH WE HAVE. OUT AS FAR AS THE BALANCER AFTER THE MAY REVISE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT SOME MONEY AT ONE TIME SOMEONE GOING. VIA AT THAT THE IDEA HERE IS POTENTIALLY DO THAT ONE TIME ALLOCATION OVER THREE YEARS THAT WE GET HAVE. DEPARTMENT OF OF THAT. DUE ON TO TO TO GRANTS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HELP AUGMENT ANDSTRENGTHEN THEIR COMMUTING GAUGE MEANT IF THEY ARE EXISTING IF THEY'RE NOT TO EXISTENT TO TO REALLY. YOU KNOW MAKE IT A REALITY. SO WE'RE WE'RE OPEN TO THAT AND I KNOW THEY ADVOCATES WOULD LIKE. ONE TIME BUT. THINK WE HAVE YOU KNOW I'M SORRY ANOTHER ADVOCATES WOULD LIKE ONGOING. BUT I KNOW WE HAVE ONGOING NEEDS WITH. HEALTHY FF AND TT ANY CA AND SO I I THINK IT IN THIS IN THIS AYE REALM AYE THINK THE AT THE APPROPRIATE SEPARATE POLLS WILL BE FOREST'S IS LOOKING AT. A ONE TIME. APPROPRIATION OKAY GRIP AND APARTMENT VAN HOW WHAT DO YOU THINK AND IF WE WERE TO. FUND THIS HOW MUCH WOULD IT TAKE AS FAR AS A GRANT OR A ONE TIME FUNDING. HAVE YOU GUYS HAD A CHANCE LOOK AT IT FOR HOW YOU DO IT. I THINK I WOULD JUST ECHO WHAT MR MCCARTY SAID AROUND TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE OBVIOUSLY THIS THIS APPROACH COULD BE SCALABLE BASED ON HOW MUCH RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AND AS WE THINK ABOUT IT. WILL LOOK AT IS TWO FOLD WHICH IS THAT THE IDEALLY I'M GOING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE INTEREST IN ONE TIME GRANTS BUT ALSO WHAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR IS THE FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYS SO WE THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO THAT. SO THAT WOULD BE FUNDING FOR ANNUAL SURVEYS FOUR I'M. FOOT FOR DISTRICTS TO ADMINISTER THE SURVEY SO WE WE WOULD TRY TO TRY TO AT LEAST HAVE THAT AS PART OF AN ONGOING AND THEN LOOKING AT THAT THE ONE DEMOCRATS I KNOW THAT DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT I THINK. WE COULD LOOK AT THIS APPROACH IS IS BEING YOU KNOW AS LITTLE AS AVAILABLE IN AS MUCH AS AS IS AVAILABLE. WELL I THINK WHEN WE LAST WEEK WE HAD OF FOR. ONE OF OUR BUDGET MEANS WE'RE LOOKING AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AT RISK IN THEIR SAN. WHEN TO TAKE WAYS I TOOK WAS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. DEVELOP WELL ON THEIR OWN CAP GENERALLY DON'T HAVE FUNDING ISSUES ABLE TO GO FORWARD. AND I THINK. DE. MY OWN LOOKING AMOUNT DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAID AND ENGAGE. COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES AND HAD A VERY ROBUST OUT OF REACH. BEEN HAVE IS THE PROBLEM THAT SOME OF THE DIDN'T AND SO I TH. I KNOW THE SEAT SHE HAD THE A PTA IS BIG ON THIS ISSUE AS FAR. FAMILY INVOLVEMENT JUST. BUT EXPAND THE NET. BECAUSE I THINK. IN EDUCATE MORE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION WITHIN SOCIETY. IT ONLY BE BETTER SERVED WHEN MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED TO TAKE OWNERSHIP TO EDUCATION. AND SO I THINK THE EXPANSION. OF THE. NOT JUST PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT BUT DHEA FAMILY INVOLVEMENT COMMITTEE INVOLVEMENT WOULD BE OF GREAT VALUE. SO I'M. INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE TO LOOK FORGET COME FORWARD IN. PORTIS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL. HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. AS AS WELL. I'M GOING TO ASK MR CHAVEZ TO UP TO TO TAKE OUR FREE ISSUE THREE THAT'S ATTACKED AFTER GO TO ANOTHER. COMMITTEE AND PRESENT. A BILL IF YOU. ISSUE THREE WILL BE TO SAY THAT CALPERS SYSTEM OUR FIRST PRESIDENT. MISERABLY JUST FOR HOME FOR AMBER ALEXANDER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. KICK IT OFF. JUST GO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE ADMINISTRATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE STATE HEALTH PFF ACCOUNTABILITY IN IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM REPLACES THE STATE'S OLD TOP DOWN AND COORDINATED APPROACH TO SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT BUT THE STRUCTURE THAT ENGAGES ALL LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE. EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES AS WELL AS THEIR STAKEHOLDERS IN UNPRECEDENTED NETWORK OF COLLABORATION AND INNOVATION IN INFORMATION SHARING. TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS INCREASE OF FOCUSED AROUND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AS OPPOSED TO STATIC GOALS. AS HELIO MENTIONED ARE ACTUALLY ANSWER THE OTHER HASN'T SPOKEN YET AS THE LA. ACT. WILL MENTION OF THE SYSTEM WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND WE SEE GREAT PROMISE IN THE WORK CURRENTLY BEING DONE BY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE CALIFORNIA CLUB REFER EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND ADVOCACY GROUPS AND ADJUSTING DIVA PERSISTENT OBSTACLES TO STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. I KNOW THAT. OUR COLLEAGUES AT THAT LEO SPOKE ABOUT THE PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND THAT WAS SPECIFIC TO TEST SCORES HOWEVER I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO. DESCRIBES SOME OF THE IMPROVING THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN AS A RESULT OF LCF FIVE. AND THERE IS WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR SUMMER MUCH WORK TO DO SPECIFICS ARE* HOURS HOWEVER I'M EARLY DATA SUGGESTS THAT THE MOVE TO LOCAL CONTROL HAS CONTRIBUTED TO IMPROVEMENTS STUDENT OUTCOMES. INCLUDING IN GRADUATION RATES WOULD HAVE INCREASED INCLUDING FOR. VARIOUS SUBGROUPS. ARE SPECIALLY FOR. SOME GROUPS HAVE HAD HISTORICALLY NOT HAD HIGH GRADUATION RATES. SUSPENSION RATES HAVE DECLINED AND SIGNIFICANT MORE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE ELIGIBLE TO ATTEND UC AND CSU AND THIS IS IN THAT IN EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE OR HAVING. EXPERIENCING AND. LOWERING AT ACE WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS PREPARED EVEN WITH LAST ATA SO IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS DEDICATED TO BUILDING OUT OUR SYSTEM OF SUPPORT TO REFLECT THE NEEDS AND THE EFFORT TO NEEDS OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS SO THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES SEVENTY POINT FIVE MILLION AN ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND. SUPPORT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION IN THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ESPECIALLY THOSE IDENTIFIED BY MULTIPLE MEASURES OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE AS BEING IN NEED OF TARGETED ASSISTANCE WHAT WE CALL DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. ADDITIONALLY THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO ENHANCE THE USER FRIENDLINESS OF THE K. TWELVE DASH BOARD OF STUDENT OUTCOMES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO CODIFIES WORK DONE IMPLEMENT THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND CLARIFIES THE RULES OF DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. THE COLLABORATIVE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITHIN THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. SPECIFICALLY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CODIFIES THE CASE STATES KEY TWELVE DASH BOARD OF STUDENT DATA IDENTIFIES COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION IS THE PRIMARY SUPPORT PROVIDER FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED AS BEING IN NEED A DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE TO ACCEPT ASSISTANCE WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. CREATIVELY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO HELP BUILD STATE RIGHT CAPACITY RUN CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. A DESCRIBES RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COLLABORATIVE IN THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK TO BUILD THIS CAPACITY AS WELL. PROVIDES AVENUES FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THE COLLABORATIVE AND THE DEPARTMENT TO ASSIST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN NEED OF EXTRAORDINARY SUPPORT. AND MAKES TECHNICAL MOMENTS TO REMOVE THE OLD ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE INDEX ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM FROM STATE LAW. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WILL GO TO THE ALEJO AYE SARAH CORD JAZZ. RIGHT. I APOLOGIZE MY COLLEAGUE AND ALSO AND ONCE WE GOT BETTER POCKET. I. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK RESEARCHER. EVER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RELATED TO SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREAS ARE SELFLESS. IN THE SPIRIT OF CORONATION ACROSS THE STATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES TEN MILLION AN ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. TO INCORPORATE SELF US INTO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SIX TO TEN SAU BELIEVES WHO WORK WITH COUNTY OFFICES O IMPROVE PEOPLE OUTCOMES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES THAT SUPPERS HAVE EXPERTISE IN THE DELIVERY AND MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES BUT COULD FURTHER ENHANCE THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY COUNTY OFFICES. AND THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT BRINGS UP AS INTO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IS CRITICAL GIVEN THAT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE NEED TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES SEVERAL CHANGES THROUGH TRAILER BILL THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GREATER COORDINATION BETWEEN SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND GENERAL EDUCATION PLANNING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SPECIFICALLY NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE ADDED FOR COUNTY AND DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS TO CONSULT WITH THEIR SELF BUT TO DETERMINE THAT ACTIONS EARNED SERVICES INCLUDED WITHIN THEIR ACCOUNT. ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR STRATEGIES IN THE SOUTH A LOCAL PLAN FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS. IN ADDITION IN AN EFFORT TO TO. FURTHER INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE SUPPLE PLAN THE BUDGET PLAN AND THE SERVICES PLAN. THE GOVERNOR DIRECTS THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP PLAN TEMPLATES AND TO ALSO DEVELOP A SUMMARY DOCUMENT THAT LINKS THE BUDGET PLAN TO THE SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES AND THE SUB CLAN. BEGINNING ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ALSO REQUIRES THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION VOCAL PLANS BE UPDATED EVERY THREE YEARS AND LINE WITH A THREE YEAR OLD HAVE PLANNING CYCLE. AND FINALLY THE GOVERNOR REQUIRES THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION POST THE LOCAL PLAN BUDGET PLAN AND SERVICES PLAN ON THEIR WEBSITE. AND ALSO THAT A COMPLETE COPY OF THE PLAN HE HELD ON FILE IN THE SOUTH OFFICE IN IT THE PARTICIPATING ELEAZAR. WE NEED TO BETTER INTEGRATE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GENERAL EDUCATION IS A THEME THAT HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. MOST RECENTLY WITH HURT REPORTS BY BOTH THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE STATE WHITE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE. BOTH CALLING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIFIED SYSTEM WITH GENERAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATION AS PART OF A SEAMLESS SUPPORT SYSTEM. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ARE ALL FOCUSED AROUND THE GOAL OF PROVIDING MORE LOCAL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ROUTE SPECIAL EDUCATION PLANNING. AND FURTHERING THESE EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GENERAL EDUCATION INTO ONE COHESIVE SYSTEM. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WITHOUT ANY FURTHER YOUR LITTLE DRUM ROLL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SARAH ORGASM IN THE LA SHOW AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE CENTER COURT HAS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ALL BE SPEAKING FROM THE HANDOUT THAT THE SERGEANT JUST DISTRIBUTED. SORE* TODAY TO DISCUSS OUR ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO PAGE ONE INTO OF THE HANDOUT PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL A WE SEE THE GOVERNOR STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IS HAVING FOR COMPONENT SO THE FIRST PROPOSAL IS PROVIDING FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO SUPPORT IDENTIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE SECOND WOULD BE PROVIDING FOUR MILLION TO ESTABLISH THE REGIONAL READABLE REGIONALLY TO ROLL WERE SIX TO TEN COUNTIES WOULD. BE SELECTED AS A REGIONALLY TO ASSIST COUNTY OFFICES TO PROVIDE BETTER SUPPORT TO DISTRICTS. AND ON PAGE TWO WE DESCRIBE THE THIRD PROPOSAL WHICH IS ESTABLISHING THE CELL PAROLE ON THIS COMPONENT PROVIDES TEN MILLION TO SELF ESTEEM FUNDS TO HELP COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SUPPORT DISTRICT. AND THE FOURTH PROVIDES ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION TO THE COLLABORATIVE TO SUPPORT COUNTY OFFICES AND DISTRICTS. ON PAGE THREE AND FOUR OF THE HAND UP PROVIDER ASSESSMENTS. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE SYSTEM MINIMIZES DISTRICT CHOICE INSTEAD OF CAPTURING THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF LOCAL CONTROL UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DISTRICTS MUST RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM THEIR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION UNLESS THEY USE FUNDING TO PURCHASE. TO PURCHASE ALTERNATIVE SUPPORT OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE LACK OF CHOICE COULD REDUCE THE QUALITY AND THE TIMELINESS. OF SUPPORT THAT A DISTRICT COULD SEE COULD RECEIVE SO WE COULD SEE THIS PLAYING OUT IN A FEW WAYS BUT ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT I COUNTY OFFICE COULD LACK OF. CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE IDENTIFIED DISTRICT AND IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY WHILE THE COUNTY OFFICES BUILDING THE CAPACITY. THE. IF THE COUNTY OFFICE ISN'T PROVIDING THE DISTRICT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SUPPORT THE STATE COULD OFFER. AND IF THE STATE FINDS A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IS NOT PROVIDING DISTRICTS WITH QUALITY OF SUPPORT THE BULK OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS NOT ON COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION BUT IT'S ON DISTRICTS BECAUSE THE DISTRICT WOULDN'T WOULD REMAIN IDENTIFIED. SO WE DO THINK COUNTY OFFICES OUR POSITION TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE STATE TO LEVERAGE THEIR EXPERTISE IN REVIEWING BUDGET AND EL COPS ON THE COUNTY OFFICES ARE WELL FUNDED TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT WHAT WE S. R. OFFICE ESTIMATES THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION FIVE. AND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN DISCRETIONARY FUNDING THAT THEY COULD USE A SUPPORT DISTRICTS. A WE CONTINUE OUR ASSESSMENTON PAGE FOUR. BUT WITH REGARDS TO THE REGIONALLY PROPOSAL OUR CONCERN IS THAT BOTH SILVA AND COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION REGIONAL LEAD A ROLES APPEAR DUPLICATIVE TO BOTH. THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED ROLE ON IN THE WITHIN THIS ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM AN ALREADY EXISTING ROLE THE FOR EXAMPLE ELEVEN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ALREADY RECEIVE FUNDING TO SERVE AS REGIONAL NEEDS. THERE'S ALSO A LACK OF CLARITY SURROUNDING THE REGIONAL NEEDS TO FOR EXAMPLE COUNTY REGIONALES ARE INTENDED TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. PART OF THE RULES ALSO TO POST ALSO TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS DIRECTLY AND IT'S UNCLEAR AT WHAT POINT A REGIONAL LEGAL SUPPORT DISTRICTS AND HOW DECISIONS TO SUPPORT THE DISTRICT WILL BE MADE. THE LACK OF CLARITY ALSO RAISES CONCERNS FOR THE SELF BELIEVES. DESPITE THE PROPOSAL INTENDING TO ADD SELFLESS TO THE CONVERSATION OF IMPROVING DISTRICTS THE LACK OF CLARITY SURROUNDING THE ROLE COULD RESULT IN COUNTIES DEFERRING DISTRICT SUPPORT TO CELL PHONES. DISCONNECTING SPECIAL EDUCATION PERFORMANCE ISSUES FROM OTHER SHOULD OF PERFORMANCE ISSUES. ON ANOTHER NOTE SELF AS OUR EXPERTS AT PROVIDING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES BUT THE ISSUES THE DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS OUR GENERAL EDUCATION ISSUES SUCH AS TEST SCORES AND SUSPENSION RATES. WE WOULD CONSIDER THE PERFORMANCE ISSUES AT THE DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS A GENERAL EDUCATION ISSUES THAT ARE DICTATED BY THE SAME POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT APPLY TO ALL STUDENT POPULATIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE WITH STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHO HAVE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE CLASSROOM. ALL THIS IS A IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT TO US WHY WE WOULD HAVE A SEPARATE ENTITY INTERVENING FOR ISSUE SPECIFIC TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES OTHER RELY ON A DIFFERENT SOURCE OF EXPERTISE FOR THOSE. SAME ISSUES WHEN THEY OCCUR WITH OTHER STUDENT POPULATIONS. ON PAGE FIVE AND SIX WE DISCUSS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. SO. AS I SAID BEFORE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE WELL POSITIONED TO ASSISTANCE TRICKS AND WE THINK COUNTIES COULD CONDUCT A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF IDENTIFYING DISTRICTS. THIS IS WHERE COUNTIES WOULD WORK WITH DISTRICTS AND UNCOVER THE ROOT CAUSES FOR FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE ISSUES. WHICH WOULD M. ACTUALLY BE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE WORK THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING SO COUNTIES COULD IN FACT SUPPORT DISTRICT BEYOND A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND HELP DISTRICTS. IMPROVING HELP DISTRICT IMPLEMENTS SOLUTIONS HOWEVER COUNTY OFFICES HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT DISTRICT AND WE RECOMMEND AUGMENTING THEIR FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE ALSO RECOMMEND REJECTING BOTH THE REGIONALLY PROPOSALS BECAUSE CREATING THESE THESE ROLES LEAD TO UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION. AHMED ALSO THE SELF RULE COULD SILO SUPPORT INSTEAD OF FOSTERING CONVERSATIONS IS ADMINISTRATION INTENDS. ON PAGE SIX WE DISCUSS OUR ALTERNATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND WE SEEING LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF LCF OFF WITHOUT CREATING ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. WE RECOMMEND USING THE COOPERATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE WHICH IS THE NEW ENTITY THAT WAS FORMED GENERALLY TO ASSIST DISTRICTS. AS AN ENTITY THAT OPERATES SIMILAR TO FIX MATCHES THE STATE'S FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY ENTITY. AND WE RECOGNIZE THIS WOULD BE A CHANGE FROM BOTH CURRENT LAW AND WHAT THE STATE AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES. SO FOR FIGURE OUT ONCE A DISTRICT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY NEED FISCAL ASSESSMENT OF FISCAL ASSISTANCE FIGMENT DEVELOPS A TEAM THAT CAN SUPPORT DISTRICTS. IN VERY SPECIFIC AREAS SO WE THINK WE CAN BUILD OFF THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN FACT MATT SUPPORTING DISTRICTS AND MODEL THE COLLABORATIVE TO OPERATE SIMILARLY. SO THE FIRST STEP OF OUR ALTERNATIVE IS THAT ANA IDENTIFY DISTRICT WOULD WORK WITH COUNTIES TO UNCOVER THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF THEIR PERFORMANCE ISSUES AS DISCUSSED EARLIER. SO ONCE THE COUNTY COMPLETED THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS ADDITION WITH AND WORK WITH THE COLLABORATIVE TO IDENTIFY AN EXPERT OR TEAM OF EXPERTS THAT THE DISTRICT COULD WORK WITH THAT IT WOULD ADDRESS THE ROOT PERFORMANCE ISSUES. THE EXPERTS COULD BE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION DISTRICTS OTHER PROVIDERS OF EDUCATION EDUCATION CONSULTANTS THE IDEA IS THAT THE COLLABORATIVE WOULD HAVE EXPERTS UNDER CONTRACT SO THAT WHEN YOU DID EXPERTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE DISTRICT THAT NEED SUPPORT. THE RECOMMENDED SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE DISTRICTS WITH GREATER CHOICE IN SELECTING EXPERTS DOES NOT REQUIRE DISTRICTS COULD WORK WITH THE COLLABORATIVE TO CHOOSE CONTRACTED EXPERTS ARE BEST SUITED TO HELP ADDRESS THE KEY PERFORMANCE ISSUES. AND DISTRICTS I'M ALREADY HAVE A STRONG INCENTIVE TO CHIU SUPPORT PROVIDERS WIRELESS WISELY I'M UNDER STATE LAW THE ULTIMATE ACCOUNTABILITY RESIDES WITH DISTRICTS BECAUSE THEY'VE REAP FACE REPERCUSSIONS IF. THE FAILED TO IMPROVE ABOVE DISTRICTS FAIL TO IMPROVE THE GET INTO INTENSIVE INTERVENTION AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF POOR DISTRICT PERFORMANCE WHERE THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION PARA CHOIR. BUDGET REVISION THAT AL CAPP PROVISIONS AS WELL AS STAY IN RESCIND ABOARD DECISIONS. SO WITH ALL THAT SAID WE PREVENT THIS OPTION TO DISPLAY BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE MODEL FOR THROUGH THE LEGSLATURE TO CONSIDER TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOME OF SUPPORTING DISTRICTS. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. WOW WE GOT A CONFLICT THAT'S COOL. LET US NOW WELL HERE FOR THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION DAVID SAP AND YOU'RE GONNA. CLARIFY THE. THE CONFLICT HERE RIGHT. BUT I'LL BE THE TIEBREAKER GASOLINE MORNING DAVID SAT STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND I LIKE TO ADDRESS THREE POINTS ON FIRST. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF. KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT OVER TIME CONTINUITY. I LARGELY AGREE WITH THE STAFF ANALYSIS IN THIS HOMES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL REFLECTS THE WORK OF THE STATE BOARD HAS DONE. TO IMPLEMENT ALL CFF BUT WE ARE RELIANT TO SOME EXTENT ON RELATIONSHIPS NORMS AND THEY INSERTED BASIC OPERATING PRINT PRINCIPLES. THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED JOINTLY WITH THE AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS IN IMPLEMENTING LCF OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES IMPORTANT CLARITY AROUND ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THEN EXPECTATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE THAT CONTINUITY FOR EDUCATORS AND STAKEHOLDERS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF LCF OUT. IN A WAY THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OUR PAST SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT AFTER. AND THAT'S MY SECOND POINT WHICH IS WHY WE SHOULD WANT TO ENSURE CONTINUITY. A COMMON FEATURE OF OUR PAST ACCOUNTABILITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS WHETHER STATE OR FEDERAL A LAW DROVE THEM WITH IF THEY WERE COMMANDED CONTROL APPROACHES. THAT RELIED ON A MIX OF SANCTIONS AND PUNISHMENT AND TIME LIMITED FUNDING. VARIOUS RESEARCH EVALUATIONS OF THOSE PROGRAMS CONSISTENTLY FOUND THEY TO NOT LEAD TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES AND HAPPY TO GO TO MORE DETAIL ON THE WISE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS. THAT THE PERFORMANCE GAPS THAT WE ARE ALL GREATLY FOCUSED ON TODAY PERSISTENT IN SOME WAYS INCREASED UNDER THOSE EFFORTS ON PASSED. SO THEY DIDN'T REALLY WORK TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH OUR ACCOUNTABILITY APPROACH. THAT PRIOR SYSTEMS WERE ALSO A THE PERSISTENCE APPROACH TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND SUPPORT WERE ALSO DISJOINTED IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE UNDER TITLE ONE WE CREATED WHICH IS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS A FEDERAL PROGRAM. ONE REGIONAL SYSTEM OF SUPPORT YET UNDER TITLE THREE WHICH IS ANOTHER FEDERAL PROGRAM FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS THERE IS A TOTALLY SEPARATE REGIONAL SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. AND THEY'D WANT COORDINATED IN THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION AMONG THEM SO JUST TO POINT OUT ABOUT THE CONCERN ABOUT CREATING REDUNDANT DUPLICATIVE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. I ACTUALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE I BELIEVE THIS IS TRYING TO REPLACE WHAT WERE DISJOINTED SYSTEMS WITH A SINGLE INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT WILL BETTER SUPPORT DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS AND ULTIMATELY STUDENTS. WHY DOES IT MATTER TO HAVE A COORDINATED SYSTEM STEPHEN CAN BE AN ENGLISH LEARNER OF FOSTER YOUTH AND OLD LOW INCOME STUDENT? BUT SHE'S NOT A SET OF LABELS SHE'S A STUDENT WITH PARTICULAR LEARNING NEEDS YET THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THAT WE CREATED FOR SCHOOLS WAS BASED ON LABELS AND CATEGORIES. AND THE BURDEN WAS ON DISTRICTS TO RECONCILE AND RATIONALIZES THE SPORTS THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO DESIGN PROGRAMS THAT MET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS RATHER THAN LABELS. WE'VE LEARNED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT APPROACH IS GOING TO THAT IT WOULD MAKE A BETTER. MAKE MAKE A BETTER WAY OF DOING IT MAINLY WHAT WE'RE DAYS WERE ASKING EDUCATORS AND STAKEHOLDERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO PHONE THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS TO IT BASED ON THE DATA THAT THEY'RE SAYING ON MULTIPLE MEASURES OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE. INERT STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IS GOING TO BE OFFERED IN A COORDINATED MANNER WHERE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE BURDEN ON DISTRICTS. TO NAVIGATE AND FIND WHAT WORKS FOR THEM THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE STATE AGENCIES TO WORK TOGETHER AND HELP DISTRICTS CONNECT TO THE RESOURCES BUT RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR DATA. SO WITHOUT MINIMIZING THE WORK THAT THE HEAD IS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THERE ARE SOME PROMISING SIGNS OF SUCCESS AND IT WON SEVERAL PUBLIC COMMENTERS REFERENCE THEIR LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE SAY WHICH I WON'T BELABOR. BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS UNDER LC FF ARE SHOWING FASTER GAINS ON SOME OF THE INDICATORS ON STUDENT ASSESSMENT PARTICULARLY AROUND MATH. IN ADDITION TO GATHER DATA POINTS THAT IS HOMES HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL POINT WHICH IS THIS ALL SOUNDS NICE BUT WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE I THINK WE'RE TALKING AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL ABOUT POLICY WITH THAT WE SOMETIMES LOSE TRACK OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS OCCURRING RIGHT NOW. DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER AS WE SPEAK LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT THEY GOT ON THE DASHBOARD IT FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESPOND AND BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. SO THIS GIVEN EXAMPLE THE EXAMPLE I'M GONNA GIVE ACTUALLY COMES FROM ONE OF THE LEARNING NETWORKS THAT MISTER DANIELS WILL TALK ABOUT IT AND IN A MOMENT THAT THE CC  <u><c.green>IS</c></u> PROVIDING. BUT THE APPROACH THAT THEY'RE USING IS VERY SIMILAR TO HELP COUNTIES OF WORKING WITH DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED FOR ASSISTANCE ON THE DASHBOARD. IN THIS EXAMPLE DISTRICT STAFF HAD COMPLETED A REVIEW OF DATA AND IDENTIFIED UNDERLYING CAUSES FOR SOME REALLY TROUBLING SUSPENSION DATA. AND WHAT THEY IDENTIFIED WERE GENERATIONAL POVERTY FAMILY STRUCTURES IN THE HOME AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS. WHEN THEY CAME BACK THE NEXT SESSION THE COUNTY OFFICE FACILITATOR ASK THEM TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED IN REFLECT ON WHETHER THEY COULD CONTROL WHAT THEY HAD IDENTIFIED. THEY ENGAGE IN A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION WITH ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE SCHOOL DISCIPLINE POLICIES MINDSET APPROACHING EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT CAME TO A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF UNDERLYING CAUSES THAT THEY ACTUALLY COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT TO ADDRESS. THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF CONVERSATION THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEONE SHOULD UP WITH A CLIPBOARD OR PRESCRIBE SAID IF. FIXES FROM SACRAMENTO BASED ON DATA THAT WAS SHOWN. SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS WHICH REALLY FOCUSED ON MIND SET AND CULTURE ARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE STATE THIS IS REALLY WHAT THIS NEW SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IS FOCUSED ON IS CHANGING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND LOOKING OF THE CULTURE OF WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO OUR STUDENTS AND IN FOCUSED ON THEIR KNEES PARTICULARLY. SO AFFORD TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS VERY MUCH DAVID. THAT'S ARE GONNA THE LA SHOW FOR ME BETWEEN THIS LOOKS I'D MISS BROWN DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ALL THESE YEARS. YEAH I THINK THAT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING DEBORAH RUN AGAIN ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM PARK SINCE I'M GONNA BUILD UPON WHAT'S UP WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN BEEN TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS TO TALK ABOUT THREE ADDITIONAL THINGS WHICH IS. THE WORK THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT DOING RELATED TO THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THAT THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT. GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THE ROLLOUT OF THAT THAT DASHBOARD AND THEN AT JUST A REALLY BRIEF UPDATE ON WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THE AS A STATE PLAN SAYS WE THINK ABOUT THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. AND ALTERNATE TO BE REPETITIVE ON THIS ONE OF WHICH IS THE IT CAN GET ITS ITS RECOGNIZING A PARTNERSHIP AND EXPERTISE AND IT. A SUPPORT THAT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE STATE CAN PROVIDE SO I I THINK ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT WERE PLEASE BE PART OF THAT AND SO THE GOAL. IS THAT ALL OF A LEVELS TO ASSIST ELEAZAR AND THEIR SCHOOLS TO MEET THE NEED OF AB EACH STUDENT SERVED WITH THE FOCUS ON BUILDING CAPACITY TO TO SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS INEQUITIES. IN STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES AND OUTCOMES AND IN ORDER TO COORDINATE SUPPORT AT ALL LEVELS THE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH PROVIDING SUPPORT UNDER LCF HAVE. EXPANDED THEIR INITIAL CROSS AGENCY GROUP TO INCLUDE STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES AND PRACTITIONERS FROM THE FIELD THIS LARGER TEAM IS A SYSTEM OF SUPPORT PLANNING GROUP AND IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS. COMMON CONCERNS AND INTERESTS FROM THE FIELD REGARDING SUPPORT FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS SO SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF SUPPORT INCLUDE INITIAL PATHWAYS TO SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE. AND SHOW OUT RETALIATES AND REVIEW OF DATA SO ADDRESS IT ADDRESSING STRINGS AND UNDERLYING CAUSES FOR STUDENT OUTCOMES AND ALSO PROVIDING SUPPORT TALLIES IN THEIR SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. THAT'S THE. AND SAID THAT THIS APPROACH HAS I AM AT AT THE THREE OF THE KEY CHIPS REFLECT THE INTENT THE DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. ADDED TO BE TAILORED TO LOCALLY IDENTIFIED NEEDS RATHER THAN IMPOSE ON A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION TO THAT'S I THINK WHAT MR AT SAP TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT SO. IT'S SUPPORTING PROVIDERS WORKING ALONGSIDE A LIAISON THEIR SCHOOLS TO IDENTIFY KEY CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. USING A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH AT TAYLOR TO LOCALLY IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND STRENGTHS AND ENGAGING WITH LOCAL EDUCATORS AND COMMUNITIES AS PART OF THAT DECISION MAKING. WITH A DECEMBER RELEASE OF THE DASHBOARD COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION HAVE BEGUN WORKING WITHOUT LIAISE IDENTIFIED. OF FOUR DIFFERENT SHE DID ASSISTANCE OF THAT THAT LEVEL TO ASSISTANCE. AND THEIR WORK WHICH ALIGNS WITH THE LC OF THAT STATUTE INCLUDES INITIAL PERSONAL CONTACT BETWEEN EACH COUNTY AND DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT AND THIS A CONTACTED OCCUR BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE DASHBOARD. AND THE WORK WILL CONTINUE WITH DATA ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING UNDERLYING CAUSES WHICH WILL INFORM ELEAZAR I'M. EL CAP AND IT WOULD JUST ALSO NOTE THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS VESTED IN THIS APPROACH AND WE HAVE INTERNALLY. ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO BETTER ALIGN THE WORK THAT WE DO AND THINK IN A MORE COLLABORATIVE WAY AND SO WE'VE DONE THIS THROUGH ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. WHICH ACROSS DIVISION I'M EFFORT LINKING STAFF WERE PROVIDING SUPPORTS A DIFF DISTRICTS WITH STAFF WERE A STANDARDS AND CONTENT AT EXPERTS. AND THAT FOCUSING ON SUPPORTING A LIAISON THEIR WORK AND WE'RE USING THE DASHBOARD TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND SAYS WE LOOK AT THAT THAT DASHBOARD. THE AD DEVELOPMENT OF THE DASH WHAT HAS BEEN AN INTENSIVE EFFORT THAT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY SINCE THE STATE BOARD ADOPTED THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE EVALUATION REPORT BACK IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND WE CONTINUE TO INCORPORATE INTENSIVE FEEDBACK FROM ANYWHERE STAKEHOLDER INPUT SESSIONS AND WORK GROUPS TO INFORM THE STATE AND LOCAL INDICATORS. IN AND THEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE FOR THE FALL TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DASHBOARD INCLUDES SEVERAL NEW FEATURES TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONALITY AN ARRAY OF NEW RESOURCES TO INCREASE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. AND UNDERSTANDING IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO USER RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE. THAT INITIAL RELEASE OF A FIELD TEST SORT OF IN THE SPRING TWENTY SIXTEEN WE. IMPROVED UPON THAT THAT DASHBOARD INTO SOME OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEW DETAILED REPORTS AND SO IN THREE PRIORITY AREAS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE SCHOOL CONDITIONS ON CLIMATE AND ACADEMIC ENGAGEMENT. AND EACH REPORT DISPLAYS THREE YEARS OF DATA IS AVAILABLE FOR EACH INDICATOR A STUDENT GROUP DATA REPORTED FOR THE ACADEMIC INDICATOR THE ACADEMIC INDICATOR NOW REPORTS. DATA FOR ENGLISH ONLY STUDENTS. LISTING ALL SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT SO WITH THIS FEATURE VIEWERS CAN ACCESS ALL THE INFORMATION ON ALL AYE SCHOOLS IN A DISTRICT BY JUST PULLING UP THE DISTRICTS M. AS THAT DASHBOARD. UPDATED VIDEO TUTORIALS AT THE DASHBOARD HOMEPAGE CONTAINS A VIDEO TO TRIAL THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE FEATURES OF THE DASH BOARD AGAIN TRYING TO MAKE IT. MORE ACCESSIBLE AND THEN PDF CAPABILITIES THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO. ADD CREDIT PDF TO PRINT IT OTHER FUNCTIONALLY WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR EDUCATORS WHO HAVE REQUESTED NUMEROUS TIMES TO SHARE REPORTS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. AN ANSWER CRITICAL INFORMATION INTO THEIR AL CAPP. I AM I WOULD SAY WE THINK WE HAVE THE RIGHT DATEABLE WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK TO IMPROVE THE ACCESSIBILITY AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE DASHBOARD SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE UNDER WAY. ARE INCLUDING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OF AN APPLE OF AN APP FOR PHONE TWO THAT I'D TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET INCLUDED. FUNDING FOR THAT DEVELOPMENT AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT BEING AVAILABLE IN THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR WERE AWESOME WELL SO WOULD LOOK TO IMPROVE THE DASHBOARD HOMEPAGE OF THE THAT GOVERNOR'S CRIME BUDGET PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED. THOUSAND DOLLARS TO UPDATE THE DASHBOARD INTERFACE INTO THAT WOULD HELP AGAIN WITH ACCESSIBILITY. UP MAKING FURTHER REVISIONS TO DASH BOARD REPORT SO DISPLAYING THEIR PORTS WITHIN THE DASHBOARD TO MAKE THEM LEX TECHNICAL LESS TEXT HEAVY EXCUSE ME AND MORE INTUITIVE FOR ALL USERS. AND ALSO DOING SPANISH TRANSLATIONS AND. THAT AGAIN WORK WERE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE AND ABOUT THAT ABOUT THE DASHBOARD WE WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT MORE IMPROVEMENTS ARM OUR. NEED TO BE MADE AND WE DO THINK THAT. THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO. SOMETHING THAT THEY ALSO SUPPORT THE USE SINCE IF WE LOOK AT A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS. A RUSTY SCHOOL OF EDUCATION A PILE AND PACE. ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS SURVEYED TO SIXTY ONE PERCENT AGREED THAT THE INFORMATION ON THE DASHBOARD IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMMUNICATE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS. AND MORE THAN HALF AGREED THAT THE DASHBOARD IS EASY TO USE. AND CAPTURE SUPPORT MEASURES AND DISTRICT SCHOOL OF DISTRICT AND SCHOOL QUALITY SO OVERALL WORK WERE POSITIVE ABOUT THAT THAT ROLE AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS ON THAT. AND THEN THE LAST THING JUST TO NOTE AROUND WHERE RAT WITH THE STATUS OF THE AS STATE PLAN IT'S A WE'VE PROVIDED UPDATES. TO THE COMMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN VARIOUS FORMS IS THAT THAT. CALIFORNIA STATE PLAN FOR A FEDERAL FUNDING HAS BEEN UNDER WAY TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ADOPTED. THE STATE PLAN BACK IN I'M SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WE RECEIVED INITIAL FEEDBACK AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO LATE IN DECEMBER MADE AT REVISIONS WERE MADE TO THE PLAN THE BOARD ADOPTED THOSE REVISIONS IN JANUARY. AND THEN FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RESULTED IN FURTHER. AT CHANGES IN MARCH AND AS WE THINK WAS NOTED EARLIER SOME OF THOSE CHANGES WORK WEREN'T QUITE READY FOR I'M A CONSIDERATION BY THE BOOK BY THE BOARD AT THE MARCH MEETING INCLUDING AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE IN CONSIDER THOSE. AND SO THERE'S A SPECIAL MEETING I'M HAPPENING ON THURSDAY WERE ULTIMATELY THAT I AM AT. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE HOPE THAT THE BOARD WILL ADOPT THE PLAN THE CAN BE SUBMITTED AND WE THINK THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT THAT WOULD BE IN A PROVABLE PLAN AND THAT'S SORT OF WHAT COMPETE. COMPLETE THE LAST PIECE OF. AT THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM AND IT WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS SO MY CHARACTER READ BETWEEN THE LINES HERE. EVEN A LOT OF GOOD STUFF BEEN VERY BUSY DON'T NEED ANYMORE AND NEW IDEAS. THEY GET RIGHT. I WOULD SAY I I THINK WERE OPENED IT TO HAVE MORE IDEAS THAT AS LONG AS IT'S NOT CHANGING THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THAT WERE UNDER WAY WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE IT MAKE THE INFORMATION THE POLITICIAN NOT YOU.

THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JEFF AKA REPRESENTING RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. ADJUST TO A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS NUMBER ONE HAS THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THAT'S REFLECTED IN HIS JANUARY BUDGET. DID BUILDING ON A POINT THAT MS HOMES AND MR SAP MADE. THIS IS LOOKING A LOT DIFFERENTLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAN IT USED TO. A THE DAYS WHEN THE COUNTY OFFICE WOULD GO INTO A DISTRICT WITH A BINDER FULL OF SOLUTIONS. THAT WERE NOT RESEARCH DRIVEN AND WE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THEY WERE GOING TO WORK OR NOT. NOW THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS TAKING PLACE THAT ARE GOING INTO THOSE ROOT CAUSES. AND DETERMINING STRATEGIES THAT WORK AND IT MAY LOOK DIFFERENT IN EACH DISTRICT AND THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AND THEN LASTLY WITH RESPECT TO A FISCAL CAPACITY. RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS BLESSED TO BE ONE OF THE HIGHEST FUNDED COUNTIES BECAUSE OF WHERE WE WERE. ABOUT AT THE ADOPTION OF pTHE POINT OF HAVING TO TRIAGE THE SUPPORT THAT WERE PROVIDED TO DISTRICTS. A SO THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THAT EXTRA FUNDING THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE PROPOSAL IS ESSENTIAL. AND PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT IN THE SAME POSITION THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO KEEP IT TO ONE MINUTE AS WE GET THROUGH THIS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MONEY GRIMACE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER. OUT WE HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS SURROUNDING A CUT A PROPOSED THREE MILLION DOLLAR CUT IN TITLE THREE FUNDS TO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THESE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE COUNTIES FOR YEARS TO PAY FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ME. OFTEN THESE ARE THE ONLY STAFF AT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WITH E. L. EXPERTISE. AND WE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CONCERNS THAT WITHOUT THE STAFF WHO HAD HIS EXPERTISE FOR MANY YEARS THERE WON'T BE THE SUPPORTS.

WE WOULD LIKE TO CALL IT AGAIN. SCHOOL CLAIM IT AS AN ISSUE THAT WE BELIEVE THE PUBLIC PUTS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY ON. AND WE FEEL THAT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO. FOLLOWING ON THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS TO HAVE EXPERTS WITHIN A COUNTY NOT JUST FOR THAT ONE COUNTY THAT THEY CAN BE CALLED UPON. UP BY OTHER COUNTIES IN THE SURROUNDING REGION AS WELL AND THAT INVESTING MONEY IN DEVELOPING PARTICULAR EXPERTISE AROUND SOME OF THE. AREAS. LIKE SCHOOL CLIMATE. THIS MONEY WILL GO FARTHER IN THE SUPPORT WILL GO FURTHER. FOR ALL OF THE SCHOOLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CZERWINSKI AND WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES ON WE AGREE VERY STRONGLY WITH THE THEORY OF CHANGE BEHIND ALL CFF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT THAT. WAS LAID OUT VERY ELOQUENTLY BY MR STRAP IN MS HOMES TODAY. WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FUND A THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WORK BUT IN OUR VIEW IT IS NOT ENOUGH. AND IT IS WHAT IS BEHIND THE A PROPOSAL THREE IN THE PRIOR AGENDA ITEM THAT YOU JUST HEARD. REGARDING INCREASING THE CAPACITY STATEWIDE FOR MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF SCHOOL CLIMATE. ALL THE EFFORTS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT WE AGREE WITH WE THINK THEY'RE RIGHT. BUT THEY DON'T GO DEEPLY ENOUGH AND THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH TO REALLY. AREN'T TAKEN ROOT AT THE LEVEL WHERE IT'S NEEDED SO THAT LOCAL CONTROL CAN TRULY BE LOCAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS VERY MUCH. YES SIR PROUD STRONG CHILDREN NOW ECHO SOME OF THE THE COMMENT YOU JUST HEARD ALSO. CHILDREN NOW IS. IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE FUNDS THAT ALLOCATED TO THE OFFICES OF EDUCATION FOR THE DIFFERENTIATED WORK. I'M AS WELL AS THE FUNDS ALLOCATED TO THE CC REGIONAL EFFORTS. AND TO OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE ONE AND WE THINK THAT THE LEVEL ONE SUPPORTS OF THE OVER ARCHING JUST THE LEVEL. OVERALL ONE. TAT LEVEL ONE SUPPORT. AND THAT BE AVAILABLE TO ALL SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS IT. ARE CURRENTLY IN A LACKING IN AND COULD COULD BE RIGHT MORE ROBUST. FINALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE. ARE WE THAT WE ADVOCATE FOR THE LEAD COE STRUCTURE. MENTIONED. PREVIOUSLY AND ALSO IN THE BUDGET THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK VERY MUCH SIR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER STEVE HENDERSON NOW REPRESENTING THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. I JUST LIKE TO. REFERENCE MY COMMENTS TO THE MONEY THAT'S IN THE BUDGET FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. IN THEIR EFFORTS TO HELP DISTRICTS WITH THE. DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE PLEASE KEEP IN MIND COUNTY OFFICES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN FACILITATING THE REDUCE REVIEW OF DATA AND ALSO THE ANALYSIS. ACTING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE DATA AND SO THEY CAN PRODUCE THEIR OWN PLAN FOR A SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE COUNTY OFFICES WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY RESOURCES AND BEST PRACTICES. TO ADDRESS UNDERLYING STUDENT POOR PERFORMANCE WE ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THAT AUGMENTATION THEY VERY MUCH SIR. MICHAEL HALL CESAR AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE KERN COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS WE JUST WANT TO. COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SPECIFICALLY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STATE BOARD IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. FOR NOT ONLY THE FUNDING THAT ARE PROVIDED FORCES MS OF SUPPORT BUT ALSO THE CLARIFICATIONS IN THE TRAILER BILL. THAT WE THINK REALLY ARE GOING TO MAKE THE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT ON THE INSTRUCTIONAL SIDE NOW STARTING WITH DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE WHAT A LOT MORE LIKE THE COLLABORATION THAT EXISTS BETWEEN COUNTY OFFICES. AND THICK MAT ON THE FISCALLY BE TWELVE HUNDRED SIDE. WE THINK THE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT EFFORT REALLY PROVIDES FOR THIS KIND OF CONTINUITY. IN THE WORKING TOGETHER THAT THAT THAT WE NEED. CLEARLY THE TRAILER BILL IDENTIFIES SOME VERY IMPORTANT NEW RESPONSIBILITIES IN TIER ONE WORK FOR COUNTY OFFICES. I IT REQUIRES ALL COUNTY OFFICES TO PROVIDE. A GREAT DEAL OF ASSISTANCE TO EVERY DISTRICT IN THEIR COUNTY PARTICULARLY DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE AND WE WELCOME. WE WELCOME THAT CLARIFICATION SO WE FULLY SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THINKING OKAY THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS SIR. I DO. NOW GET ALL THAT DONE. MISS BROWN. CHIU BUT YOUR BACK AND WE WERE DOING THIS. THE HAVE. WHO IS THE PRIMARY AUDIENCE OF THE DASHBOARD? WE ARE WE HAD A BIG DISCUSSION WHERE WE ARE GOING TO DEVELOP THE STASH WHERE WE HAD A LADY IN HERE FROM DAVIS WHO. HAD ALL THE DATA POINTS DO MEMBER WHO THE. PRIMARY AUDIENCE IS AND WE REMEMBER THAT. WHY DID WE DO THE DASHBOARD WHO IS THE PRIMARY AUDIENCE I THINK HE'S GOING TO GRAB THAT ONE POINT? OKAY. DAVID'S SAVER. SHE MAY HAVE TO SAVE ME. SO I I. I I THINK THAT THAT'S. THAT'S IN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE MULTIPLE AUDIENCES FOR YOU KNOW YOU'VE EDUCATORS WHO WANT. DEEPER DATA AND HOW TO ANALYZE IT AND OF COURSE THERE'S PARENTS IN THE PUBLIC THIS IS PART OF A THAT YOU KNOW COUNT ABILITY ANY LOCAL ENGAGEMENT THAT THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT AUDIENCES. AND I THINK THAT WHEN THE THINGS THAT THE REDESIGN THAT MISS BROWN ALLUDED TO THAT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY WANTED THING THAT INCLUDES IS A MUCH CLEAR STATEMENT OF WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE DASHBOARD. AND IS TRYING TO CLARIFY THE PRIMARY AUDIENCE IS THE PUBLIC PARENTS AND IN THE BROADER THE BROADER PUBLIC THEIR ADDITIONAL RICH DATA RESOURCES THAT EXISTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS. THERE'S DATAQUEST THERE'S THE ASSESSMENT WEBSITE THE CAST THAT WEBSITE THAT SHOWS THE RESULTS THE DEPARTMENT IS ACTUALLY CREATED SPECIAL REPORTS. FOR SOME OF THE INDICATORS ON THE DASHBOARD THAT INCLUDED A MORE RICH BREAKDOWN OF THE DATA. SAID THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN YOU USE THE DASHBOARD AND POINT PEOPLE TO THOSE OF RICHER DATASET FOR EDUCATORS OTHERS WHO DON'T WANT TO DIG DEEPER AND. IN PARENTS AND THE PUBLIC WHO ULTIMATELY SOME OF THEM DO WANT TO DIG DEEPER BUT NOT ALL OF INDIA AND THINKING ABOUT THE AUDIENCE A LITTLE MORE CAREFULLY AND GET THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES ADDITIONAL MONEY. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO. THERE'S AN EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO DO IT AND THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN PRESENT INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT'S MORE ACCESSIBLE AND INTUITIVE TO THE GENERAL AUDIENCE WHILE STILL MAKING IT MEANINGFUL IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLICK IT LEVELS DOWN TO GET TO THAT DETAIL IF YOU WANT IT. SAY I I THINK THAT YOUR QUESTION IS THE RIGHT ONE. I THINK THERE IS A STRUGGLE WITH WHICH THE RIGHT AUDIENCE WAS AND I THINK WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING THE PRIMARY AUDIENCE SHOULD BE PARENTS. AND THE PUBLIC IN THAT WE CAN USE OTHER DATA RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEED OF EDUCATORS FOR RICHARD DATASETS EXACTLY RIGHT HE WAS FOR THE PARENT BECAUSE. MEMBER HOW WE STARTED THIS TIME. CAPITAL YOU HAVE A MEMBERS BETTER SIX YEARS. WHEN WE STARTED THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING. USE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN THAT WE SAID WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE LOCAL. THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PEOPLE ENGAGED SO WE DEVELOPED THE EL CAP. AND THEY SAID SO WE'RE GOING TO BE PUT THE MONEY IN THERE HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY ME WORK AND I MEMBER HAVE BEEN HEARING. SOME LADY CAME FROM DAVIS WAS SAYING ó YOU NEED ALL DIFFERENT. POINTS AND I REMEMBERED AT TONY SAID YOU KNOW YOU'RE SITTING HERE. TELL US WHAT YOU LOOK AT. BUT I THINK THE AVERAGE PARENT IS ACTUALLY AT WORK TONIGHT HERE AT A HEARING IN SACRAMENTO. AND WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW IS BEING LOOKED UP QUICKLY AND THAT'S IT. BACK THEN WE DIDN'T HAVE THE WERE DASHED WHAT IS ACTUALLY MY TERM I SAID BACK IN THE IN THE MILITARY WORLD WE USE A DASHBOARD LOOK AT COLORS WE CAN. LOOK AT AND SAY THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE IS NOT A PROBLEM HERE BUT THEN YOU CAN THAT CAN DO IT AND GO. ALL THE DETAILS YOU WANT TO AND JUST HAVE FUN FOREVER. OR YOUR PARENTS TO LOOK AT IS IS OKAY MY KIDS ARE DOING WELL. AND SO THAT'S JOB THAT'S HOW WE STARTED THIS SO THAT'S WHY WE. TRYING BACK TO THE QUESTION WHERE DID IT. TERM DASHBOARD GAME IT WAS GLOBAL PRO FUNDING LUCK AT. ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE DASHBOARD IT WAS DESIGNED PRIMARY FOR THE PARENTS TO GET HIM ENGAGED. THESE THAT'S WHY WE CALL THE HISTORY OF IT. THE. MISS CORTEZ YOU'RE IN YOUR ANALYSIS OF THIS. WHEN YOUR RECOMMENDATION. THE. THERE'S A TERM I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO AN ORGANIZATION DYNAMICS THAT YOU CAN'T. MAKE SOMEBODY RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME LESSER ACCOUNTABLE FOR. THEY GOT TO BE ABLE AFFECTED BY THE EYES DOES HAPPEN. AND WHEN I WAS LISTENING TO THE PRESENTATION. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONSI ASKED MY STAFF TO DO AN ORG CHART FOR ME ON HOW THIS WORKED. AND IT WAS REALLY LIKE AN OCTOPUS. ALWAYS THINGS GOING AROUND. SO I DON'T REALLY BUY INTO THAT. I THINK I AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION PHILIP FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. RULES ARE GENERALLY. YOU CAN HAVE A CENTRALIZED GOALS. AND. VISION AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO UP HERE. BUT YOU NEED DECENTRALIZED EXECUTION TO GET IT DONE BECAUSE. FRESNO IS DIFFERENT OF SAN DIEGO'S DIFFERENT AN ALLY AND WE ARE PROFESSIONALS AT ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. OUR TRAINED TO DO THIS AND IF THEY NEED ASSISTANCE IN THE COUNTY THAT GETS IN BOEING START THOUGH ON A BUNCH OF FINGERS IN THEM PIE. THE NO ONE'S RESPONSE WHERE WE SUCK ENOUGH MONEY IN THE END THE DAY WE GOT. NOTHING. SO I FROM MY POSITION. I LIKE THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION AND. HOPE YOU GO LOOK AT IT THAT WHICH YOU WANT TO WE CAN NOW TALK ABOUT IT LATER. AS ANYTHING ELSE. REALLY LOVE THIS AND YOU CAN'T TELL I GET A KICK OUT OF THIS ONE THIS IS IT WAS IN THE GROUP HAVE WATCH IT COME THROUGH FOR ALL THESE YEARS. WE'RE DONE. I DO HAVE A LOT OF. HOWEVER. YEAH. OKAY AND I CAN'T HELP. NO
