THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELISTS FOR JOINING OUR HEARING NOW LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S DISCUSSION AFTER EACH PANEL. I WILL OPEN IT UP TO THE SUB COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE QUESTIONS I WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER BOTH PANELS THAT'S INCLUDED. ON A PERSONAL NOTE I LIVE IN A REALLY IMPACTED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY- AND SO IT IS TROUBLING TO SEE THAT AN AGENCY. AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT IS AIMED AT HELPING TO PROTECT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND MY CONSTITUENTS. IS MISAPPROPRIATING THE FUNDS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GO AFTER POLLUTERS. THAT ARE MAKING A SICK ON A REGULAR ASIS AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS HEARING. DO ANY OF OUR- MY COLLEAGUES WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS BEFORE WE START. OKAY WELL THEN WITH THAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH. OUR FIRST PANEL WHICH IS THE ORIENT A REVIEW OFTHE STATE FUNDING. TO THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION A NOT A FINDING. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE'RE GONNA HAVE. K. R. THE SENIOR ODD NEXT IN CALIFORNIA AND LEADERSHIP COUNCIL ALL PARTICIPATE IN THIS PANEL. I NEED TO LEAVE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ARE HAVING US TODAY- WE WERE ASKED BY STAFF TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF STATE FUNDING SOURCES TO CDA AS WELL AS AN OVERVIEW OF THE ADDICTS. I WILL BE SHARING MY SCREEN AND USING THE CANNOT THAT WE'VE BEEN WE'VE PREPARED AS A GUIDE FOR COMMENTS TODAY. SO YOU CAN SEE THE HANNIBAL FOR YOU- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT- IF YOU'VE GOT IT BEFORE YOU WILL JUST. PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHLIGHT RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OR CA. IT IS A NOT FOR PROFIT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION THAT CONSIST OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FEELS. THE ORGANIZATION ENGAGES IN VARIOUS ACTIVITIES RANGING FROM LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY TO STATE MY TRAINING. AND RECEIVES FUNDS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP DUES- STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINES AND LITGATION PROCEEDS FROM STATE AND LOCAL CASES. SOME OF THE MONIES THAT ARE RECEIVED ARE RESTRICTED OR REQUIRED FOR USED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE OF OUR HAND OUT WE'RE GONNA FIRST PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF STATE FUNDING PROVIDED TO CDA AND RECENT YEARS. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS HAND OUT WE THINK OF STATE FUNDING AS ANY MONIES THAT HAVE AUTHORIZATION UNDER STATE LAW AND THIS WILL INCLUDE ANY FEDERAL FUNDS WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE. BEEN AVAILABLE ON WITHOUT THE STATE'S PRESENCE AND IT ALSO INCLUDES LITIGATION FINES FROM CASES PURSUED BY THE STATE. SO LOOKING AT THIS THE FUNDING REALLY FALLS WITHIN SEVEN CATEGORIES- THE FIRST TWO CATEGORIES RELATES TO ENVIRONMENTS THE ENVIRONMENTS. THE FIRST CATEGORY IS THAT CDA RECEIVES FUNDING TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE TRAINING ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS INCLUDING TEACHING PROSECUTION AND INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES. THE FUNDING IS COMING FROM A STATE ACCOUNT CALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT AND TRAINING ACCOUNT OR ETA. AND AT LEAST AVAILABILITY ARE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND SO CA LAST RECEIVED AROUND FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FROM ETA FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IN PRIOR YEARS THE AMOUNT WAS HIGHER SO THEY COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE IN LOVE COUPLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THE SECOND CATEGORY FUNDING IS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUIT PROSECUTOR PROJECT WHICH IS A JOINT PROJECT BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND CDA. AND THE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT WAS FOR EFFECTIVE ANDUNIFORM ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS UPON THEIR REQUEST IN PROSECUTING THESE TYPES OF CASES- SIMILAR TO THE FIRST CATEGORY SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY. AT LEAST 25% OF THE ETA MONIES ARE TO SUPPORT CTAS COSTS FOR THIS PROJECT AND CDA LAST RECEIVED AROUND. SIXTY THREE THOUSAND FOR THE PROJECT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE THIRD CATEGORY OF FUNDING RELATES TO ASSET FORFEITURE I'M STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT STATE AND LOCAL DRUG RELATED ASSET FORFEITURES BE DISTRIBUTED IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND THIS INCLUDES AN ALLOCATION OF 1% OF PROCEEDS GO TO A PRIVATE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION COMPOSED OF LOCAL PROSECUTORS. FOR STATE MY TRAINING IN THIS AREA AND THIS IS TRADITIONALLY BEEN CDA SOME TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN C. A. RECEIVED AROUND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FROM ASSET FORFEITURE CASES. NOT TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT IF YOU'VE GOT A BEFORE YOU THE FOURTH CATEGORY OF FUNDING RELATES TO THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY THEFT APPREHENSION AND PROSECUTION PROGRAM. WHICH WAS CREATED BY STATE LAW TO IMPROVE THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF THESE TYPES OF CASES. THE FUNDS SOURCE FOR THIS IS FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT FUNDS THAT GO TO MARIN COUNTY WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR USE BY CDA FOR- STATE MY TRAINING AND RESEARCH IN THIS AREA AND WE ESTIMATE THAT CDA RECEIVES AROUND A HUNDRED AND. NINETY TWO THOUSAND ANNUALLY. FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. WHAT CATEGORY OF FUNDING IS- STATE GRANT PROGRAMS TO CDA HAS RECEIVED GRANT FUNDING FROM VARIOUS AGENCIES OVERSIGHT. AND THE FUNDING CAN FLUCTUATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT CD EIGHT SIX THE FUNDING AND WHETHER IT THERE ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE GRANT AWARD. FROM THE EXAMPLES ON THIS PAGE WILL ALSO SEE THAT THE TIME PERIOD COVERED BY THE GRANT. ALSO MAY DIFFER AND TO KEEP THE APPLES ARE RECENT GRANTS INCLUDE- ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND FEDERAL FUNDS FOR- ABUSE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAMINATIONS TRAININGS. ONE POINT TWO MILLION IN FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS FOR THE STATE MY TRAINING ON. THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ABUSE CASES. SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AND FEDERAL FUNDS WERE SPECIALIZED TRAINING- RELATED TO PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL CHILD ABUSE CASES. AND THEN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR SPECIALIZED- VICTIM SERVICES TRAINING IN TERMS OF HOW. TO DEAL WITH CERTAIN- BECOME POPULATIONS. TURNING PAGE. OF YOUR HAND OUT THE SIX CATEGORY A FUNDING. IS RELATED TO MONIES RECEIVED FROM SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS IN CASES THAT WERE FILED AND RESOLVED BY THE STATE'S OF FOR EXAMPLE CDA RECEIVED AROUND A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. RELATED TO CONSUMER PROTECTION CASES THAT WERE RESOLVED BY DOJ THE AMOUNT CAN FLUCTUATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR. THE SEVENTH AND FINAL CATEGORY OF FUNDING IS- FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES AND FROM VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES IT COVERS A VARIETY OF PURPOSES RANGING FROM ATTORNEY MEMBERSHIP DUES TO TRAINING FEES. TO PUBLICATIONS- CITY GIVEN CDA NEARLY FORTY TWO THOUSAND AND SUCH PAYMENTS FROM DOJ IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY. TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE ARE GOING TO SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO THE AUDIT- AND WE WILL BE PROVIDING A SUMMARY OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITS. OF CDA THAT WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. THIS AUDIT WAS INITIATED BY CD EIGHT IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY- THE FOCUS WAS A SPECIFIC LINE ITEM AUDIT OF SETTLEMENTS JUDGMENTS AND GRANT MONIES. FOR A SUBSET OF THEIR FUNDING- SPECIFICALLY ROUGHLY SIX ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY RELATED C. A. PROGRAMS GOING BACK THROUGH TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. IN TERMS OF THE AUDITS- THE AUDITOR FOUND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FINDINGS WE GENERALLY FOUND THAT THEY COULD BE CATEGORIZED IN THREE KEY AREAS. O THE FIRST KEY AREA ONE IS THAT CDA ROUTINELY BORROW THE RESTRICTED FUNDS FROM THE PROGRAMS AND TRIGGERED THE MONIES AS UNRESTRICTED AND THIS PRACTICE WAS INSTRUMENTAL TO CBA'S FINANCIAL VIABILITY SINCE. TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. THE SECOND KEY FINDING FROM THE AUDIT THAT WAS THAT AS OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION WAS STILL OWED. FIFTY DELIVERIES ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY PROGRAMS FROM ITS UNRESTRICTED GENERAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT AND THAT CDA DIDN'T CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO REPAY THE AMOUNT AT THAT TIME. THE THIRD KEY FINDING WAS A NUMBER OF CONCERNS RELATED TO INTERNAL ACCOUNTING PRACTICES- THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IN THE MONIES THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED HAVE BEEN MISSED ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE ARCTIC PROGRAM. THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT CTAS AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EACH FISCAL YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AB INACCURATELY REPORTED THE MAJORITY OF REVENUES AND NET. ASSETS AS UNRESTRICTED. THE AUDITOR FOUND INTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTS LACKED INFORMATION ON WHETHER PROGRAM FUNDS WERE RESTRICTED AND ALSO LACKED OTHER INFORMATION TO ASSESS EACH PROGRAM'S OVERALL FISCAL CONDITION. AND FINALLY THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT INTERNAL ACCOUNTING PRACTICES SPECIFICALLY HOW REVENUES AND TRANSFERS WERE DOCUMENTED CHANGE AROUND FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHICH RESULTED IN CERTAIN FINANCIAL REPORTS BEING INTERNALLY AND INCONSISTENT. TURNING TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR HAND OUT CDA THE CDA BOARD TOOK FOR ACTION IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY BEFORE THE AUDIT BEGAN AND THE AUDITOR GENERALLY AGREED THAT THEY WERE APPROPRIATE. SO THESE FOR ACTIONS THAT WERE ADOPTED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING FIRST THE BOARD SPECIFIED THAT ANY FUTURE MONIES RECEIVED BY THE C. A. ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY PROGRAMS WOULD BE DEPOSITED INTO SEPARATE RESTRICTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS. THE SECOND ACTION THE BOARD TOOK WAS TO INCREASE OVERSIGHT BY REQUIRING THAT COPIES OF BANK STATEMENTS RELATED TO THOSE NEW SEPARATE ACCOUNTS THE PROVIDED TO THE CO CHAIRS OF CDA IS ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE. THE THIRD ACTION THE BOARD TOOK WAS IN THE ABSENCE OF KIND OF ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES THE BOARD COMMITTED TO PROVIDING FISCAL SUPPORT FOR CD EIGHT ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS FROM ITS UNRESTRICTED GENERAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT- AND THEN THE FOURTH ACTION OF THE BOARD TOOK. IS IT SPECIFIED THAT AT LEAST 10% OF UNENCUMBERED UNRESTRICTED GENERAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT MONIES WOULD BE SATISFIED AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR IN ORDER TO RESTORE THE FUND BALANCES OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY PROGRAM. TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT IN ADDITION TO THOSE ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN BY THE BOARD. THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED FIVE ADDITIONAL ACTIONS FOR CD EIGHT TO TAKE. THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION WAS FOR CDA TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS TO REVIEW THE FUNDING RESTRICTIONS TO ELIMINATE ANY AMBIGUITIES- RELATED TO THOSE MINING IT'S SO FOR EXAMPLE PRISON FOR. RESUMING THAT ANY MONIES RECEIVED RELATED TO JUDGMENTS WERE RESTRICTED. THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION WAS TO IMPROVE EXTERNAL REPORTING BY HAVING CD A THAT A REPORT ON HOW JUDGMENTS MONIES WERE USED. THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION THE AUDITOR MADE WAS TO INCREASE INTERNAL REPORTING TO LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT BODIES INCLUDING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF RECEIVED MONEY. THE FOURTH RECOMMENDATION WAS FOR CDA TO IMPROVE THEIR ACCOUNTING PRACTICES IN VERY SPECIFIC WAYS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE FINANCIAL REPORTS WERE INTERNALLY CONSISTENT. AND FINALLY THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED IMPROVING INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS BY HAVING COPIES OF ANY JUDGMENTS BE PROVIDED TO YOU SEE THE EIGHT ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE A COPY OF THAT AND SO THAT THEY COULD DOCUMENT MONIES IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER INCLUDING TO TRACK WHETHER OR NOT THE MONIES HAD ACTUALLY BEEN RECEIVED. WITHOUT WILL CONCLUDE OUR COMMENTS WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE NEXT PANEL OF CAN BEGAN. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING. MY NAME IS KEN SPENCE AND I'M A SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR AT NEXT IN POLICY CENTER BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION ISSUES. ALTHOUGH VITAL JUSTICE POLICY IS NOT MY COURT AREA NEXTGEN IS A JUSTICE AND EQUITY CENTER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. FOUNDED BY TOM DYER FOCUSES ON IT A DIVERSE ARRAY OF POLICY AREAS. HEALTH EDUCATION. FOOD SECURITY ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY TO VOTING RIGHTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SO GIVEN OUR FOCUS. THIS ISSUE REALLY STRUCK A IN EQUITY AND JUSTICE STANDPOINT. THIS PUBLIC TAXPAYER MONEY WAS INTENDED TO DO JUST THAT. TO PROVIDE EQUITY AND JUSTICE TO BUY SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT NEED THIS TYPE OF SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE TO GO AFTER THOSE WHO VIOLATE OUR VINYL PROTECTION LAWS. AND FOR OUR COMMUNITIES IN HARM'S WAY. IT IS FUNDS WERE LARGELY SAYS THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY RANDOM APARTMENT POLLUTION AND DEGRADATION. AND THAT IS THE REASON THAT WE ALONG WITH TEN OTHER APARTMENT ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. COMPELLED TO SIGN ONTO A LETTER REQUESTING BACK DECISIVE AND SWIFT ACTION BE TAKEN TO HOLD THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS MISDEEDS. WE WANT RESPECT FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO FOLLOW. WANT TO SHORTEN THE FOURSOME TRAINEE FUNDS NO LONGER PATH TO CDA AT. TO THERE'S A ROBUST INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE FULL SCOPE WHETHER MY FEELINGS IN THEM OUT OF MONEY THAT WAS MISUSED OR MISAPPROPRIATED OVER THE YEARS. THREE IF YOU NEED A REPAIR MUNICIPAL ALL MONEY THE STOLEN AND FINALLY. GOING FORWARD. AB PROHIBITIVE EITHER DISTURBING OR RECEIVING GRANTS INTENDED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL FORCING ENSURING. PLEASE CRITICAL DOLLARS SHOULD KEEP ON. A WEAK INTENDED GIVING CA DENTISTRY ON TRUSTWORTHINESS THE FUNDS SHOULD INSTEAD BE OVERSEEN BY RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. AND GO DIRECTLY TO THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS DOING THIS CRITICAL WORK. IN THE FINAL THING I LIKE TO SAY. IS THAT AT A TIME WHEN PUBLIC TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN SO UNDERMINE. WHAT WE CAN TO HAVE HERE **** ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF ALARMFORCE ORGANIZATION. FLAGRANTLY IGNORE BOTH THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE. IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR MOST AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES. ARE USING RESOURCES PROVIDED TO HELP PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND FAMILIES. BY METAL MARC. TWO STATE CHAMPION POLICIES THAT SUPPORT MASS INCARCERATION. IN THE WAY OF COMPLETE JUSTICE REFORM. ANY SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CHURCH. THANK YOU CAN WE HAVE OUR NEXT PANELIST WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. HI GOOD MORNING I AM ACTUALLY WARNER AND I'M A DIRECTING ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WORKS ALONGSIDE RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND EAST COACHELLA VALLEY. MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES WE WORK WITH EXPERIENCED SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION RESULTING FROM POLLUTING LAND USES LOCATED WITHIN AND SURROUNDING THESE COMMUNITIES. IN MANY CASES THE ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS CAUSED BY THESE LAND USES EXCEED LIMITS SET BY LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND OFTEN RESULT FROM LANDOWNERS AND FACILITY OPERATORS FAILURE TO TAKE REQUIRED STEPS TO REDUCE IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND NEARBY HOMES. AS VIOLATIONS UNDERMINE PUBLIC HEALTH HOUSING QUALITY AND WELL BEING AND OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND DEEPEN THE DISPARITIES ALONG RACE INCOME AND GEOGRAPHIC LINES THAT SCAR OUR STATE. I'LL SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE TO EXAMPLES FROM FRESNO FOR WHICH DISTRICT ATTORNEY INTERVENTION COULD HAVE CORRECTED ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATIONS AND BENEFITED THE PUBLIC. THE FIRST EXAMPLE IS THE DARLING INGREDIENTS MEAT RENDERING PLANT LOCATED IN THE HEART. OF THE WEST FRESNO COMMUNITY. WEST FRESNO IS COMPRISED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF BLACK LATINO AND ASIAN AMERICAN RESIDENTS AND RANKS AMONG THE MOST POLLUTION BURDEN NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE STATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EPA'S HOW EMBARRASSED GREAT TOOL. THE DARLING PLANT IS LOCATED ACROSS FROM A COMMUNITY PARK AND YOUR HOMES AND I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND PROCESSES EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS OF MEAT PER DAY. ODORS FROM ITS OPERATIONS SATURATE THE AIR IN RESIDENTS YARDS AND PUBLIC SPACES. INVADE HOMES THROUGH OPEN WINDOWS IN EACH FAX SYSTEMS AND BECAUSE RESIDENTS EXPERIENCING NAUSEA AND HEADACHES AND STRESS. INTO MANY OCCASIONS TRUCKS HAVE LEACHED ANIMAL JUICES AND IT'S SPELLED AND COVERED ANIMAL CARCASSES ON THE LOCAL ROADWAYS. DESPITE THE PLANT SIZE AND SEVERE IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AT THE FACILITY IS OPERATED FOR FIFTY YEARS WITHOUT EVER OBTAINING A LAND USE PERMIT REQUIRED BY THE LOCAL MUNICIPAL CODE WITHOUT EVER UNDERGOING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. THANKS TO THE DEDICATION OF A GROUP OF COMMUNITY LEADERS CALLED CONCERNED CITIZENS OF WEST FRESNO DISCOVER THE PLANTS LACK OF A LAND USE PERMIT AND WHO FOUGHT FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS TO ADDRESS THE PLANTS VIOLATIONS. THE PLANT WILL SHUT DOWN IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. HOWEVER INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE COULD HAVE SAVED ME AS RESIDENTS COUNTLESS HOURS. FREED UP NONPROFIT LEGAL COUNSEL AT LEADERSHIP COUNCIL TO PURSUE OTHER VIOLATIONS AND HELP SECURE JUSTICE YEARS EARLIER. THE SECOND EXAMPLE I WILL SHARE IS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AMAZON WAREHOUSE CENTER IN SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO I NEARBY HOMES AND AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN THE MOST POLLUTION BURDEN CENSUS TRACT IN THE STATE ACCORDING TO CALAVERAS SCREEN. DURING THE FACILITIES AROUND THE CLOCK MONTHSLONG CONSTRUCTION DUST CLOUDS FROM CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES COLLUDED RESIDENTS HOMES TRIGGERING ASTHMA ATTACKS. AND UNRELENTING NOISE KEPT RESIDENTS UP AT NIGHT. ONE RESIDENT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH WHO LIVES ACROSS FROM THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER EXPERIENCE DEFINITELY IN ONE YEAR. SINCE THE FACILITY INITIATED OPERATIONS AND MYRIAD OF IMPACT UNDERMINE RESIDENTS ENJOYMENT OF THEIR HOMES AND THEIR HEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE UNABATED LIGHT SPILLS INTO HOMES FROM TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY OPERATIONS AND INTERRUPT RESIDENTS SLEEP. KEEP FROM THE ENORMOUS CONCRETE STRUCTURE RESULT IN HIGHER LOCAL TEMPERATURE IS FORCING RESIDENTS TO RUN THEIR AC'S HARDER AND PAY EVEN MORE FOR UTILITIES AND FRESNO IT'S HOT SUMMERS. TRUCKS SPEED ON LOCAL ROADS CREATING SAFETY HAZARDS FOR KIDS WALKING TO THE NEARBY SCHOOL AND KICKING UP DUST THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR RESIDENTS TO BREEZE. THESE IMPACTS EXACERBATE THE DISPROPORTIONATELY POOR PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES THE COMMUNITY ALREADY EXPERIENCES. MANY OF THEM ARE APPARENT VIOLATIONS OF LOCAL OR STATE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. THE WEST FRESNO DARLING INGREDIENTS PLANT IN SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO AMAZON WAREHOUSE ARE TWO STRIKING EXAMPLES OF INSTANCES WHERE DISTRICT ATTORNEY INTERVENTION COULD PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO IMPACTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHILE ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. EXAMPLES LIKE THIS ABOUND THROUGHOUT THE INLAND IN RURAL REGIONS IN WHICH W WORK WE HOPE THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE TAKES APPROPRIATE ACTION TO ENSURE THAT THE INTENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT INTRIGUING ACT IS REALIZED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO OUR PANEL I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO- COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WANTED TO START WITH THE L. A. AND IF WE COULD GO BACK TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR- REPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY ERA. YES ABSOLUTELY. MEET A PARTICULAR PART OKAY I IN YOUR LAST BULLET ON PAGE SIXTY TALKED ABOUT CTA'S- PROMISED TO PAY BACK THE FUNDS. IN YOUR APPROXIMATION HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO PAY BACK THE FUNDS WITH THE WHAT WHAT WHAT THE LAST WITH US THERE. IT'S A LITTLE BIT FOR US A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT FOR US TO TELL BECAUSE WITH THE INVESTIGATION IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT- INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED RELATED TO TOTAL AMOUNTS. THAT ARE AVAILABLE ARE A LITTLE BIT HARD TO COME BY- I WOULD SAY THAT. THE KEY FOCUS HERE IS THAT IT IS UNENCUMBERED AND UNRESTRICTED AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE THAT QUITE A FEW. OF THE MONEY THAT I RECEIVE BY CDA ARE ACTUALLY RESTRICTED AND SO WE'VE SEEN ESTIMATES THAT THIS COULD BE SOMETHING AROUND. YOU KNOW THE WINDS OF A HUNDRED AND THOUSANDS YOU KNOW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD BE AVAILABLE. PER YEAR AND SO IF KEEPING IN MIND THAT THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THERE WAS TWO POINT NINE MILLION THAT MUST BE REPAID THAT'S- QUITE A FEW YEARS. SO WE'RE TALKING OF AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS. TO REPAY THAT IF THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY THAT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. SO LET'S ASSUME FOR A SECOND THAT. THEY STARTED BORROWING FROM RESTRICTIVE FUNDS BECAUSE- THERE FINANCES WERE NOT A- ARE NOT ADEQUATE AND THE WAY THEY WERE SPENDING. AND SO. AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN OF THAT PLAN THAT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE ANY MONEY AT THE END OF THE YEAR TO REPAY ANYTHING SOMEBODY HAVE A PLAN THAT'S AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS IS ALSO GETS AS MIGHT BE NEVER. THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LETTERS THAT. IT THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY CAN PULL. ONE IS- ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE MIKE MADAM CHAIR BROUGHT UP. THE OTHER IS ONE OF THEIR FUNDS WORTH IS ON THE MEMBERSHIP DUES. SIDE FOR EXAMPLE AND SO- IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THE BOARD COULD CHOOSE TO INCREASE. DUES FOR EXAMPLE OR A LOOK AT RAISING REVENUES AND- OTHER WAYS- AND THOSE FINES FOR THE MOST PART IF THEY'RE COMING IN FROM MEMBERSHIP DUES. WOULD BE A- LESS RESTRICTED THAN YOU KNOW COMING IN FROM LITIGATION FOR EXAMPLE- IN. AND THEN I THINK OF COURSE YOUR FIRST BILL ELLIOTT BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THE EASY GROUPS. DOT IT WAS JUST OF THE SPECIFIC BONTA WE DON'T AND WE DO NOT KNOW THERE WAS A MISAPPROPRIATION OF OTHER FUNDS. HER ACCESS SO- FOR EXAMPLE- UNDER LIST OF STATE FUNDING- THE ASSET FORFEITURE FUNDING THE HIGH TECH FUNDING THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF OTHER FUNDING THAT THEY'RE GETTING AT LEAST FROM THE STATE LEVEL. THAT WAS NOT REVIEWED BY THE AUDIT THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS WITHIN CDA THAT ARE OPERATED- WE'VE HEARD FOR EXAMPLE RELATED TO WORKER RECEIVE STATE FUNDING BUT THEY CAN BE RECEIVING LITIGATION DOLLARS FROM CASES THAT ARE EDUCATED LOCALLY AND THEY'RE GETTING MONEY THAT WAY SO IT DIDN'T COVER- IT DIDN'T COVER REVIEW OF ANY. SORRY DIDN'T COVER AN AUDIT OF HIGH TECH OR THE ASSET FORFEITURE FUNDS- BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER FINDS A SIMILAR TO WORKER SAFETY WHICH WAS REVIEWED- WHERE THE MONIES ARE COMING IN LOCALLY OR FROM SETTLEMENTS THAT. THAT ARE- THAT HAVEN'T BEEN REVIEWED EITHER- OKAY AND THEN MAIL MY LAST QUESTION TO THE ALEJO- USE YOU GAVE US A LIST OF. A THING FOR THINGS THAT THE CDA IS DOING TO TRY TO REFORM ITS WAY. BUT THERE FIVE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDIT THAT THEY HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED ARE THEY NOT PLANNING TO IMPLEMENT YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY CLUE ABOUT THAT. I DO NOT KNOW- CTAS PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE AUTHOR. I THANK YOU WITH I APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE. THE LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT THAT YOU GAVE US ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FENCE HERE IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING WE DON'T HAVE. CDA TO BILLS HAVE SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY OF THEM BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION YOU'VE PROVIDED US OF THE FLOOR- NEXT I WANT TO TALK TO THE E. J. GROUPS AND I THINK EITHER. I WOULD NEXT SENATE LEADERS TO COUNCIL AT THE NEXT AND SPECIFICALLY- SAID THAT THE SELLER SHOULD NOT BE GOING TO CDA AND SO IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THE ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED VIOLATIONS. AND DO YOU HAVE ANY COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES WITH ANY DA OFFICES AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE WORKED IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE SO WITH ALL TERM AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MADAM CHAIR. OF IN TERMS OF ONE ALTERNATIVE- THAT MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN GETTING A POINT WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO- I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THAT WE'RE% NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE MONEY SHOULD NOT GO. TO LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICES OR TO ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND AS IT DOES NOW. BUT IT SHOULD NOT PASSED THROUGH. X. ONE OPTION FOR EXAMPLE. IF IT'S MONEY- YOU KNOW INITIALLY COMING FROM TOP COUNTY PA. READ THE PASSAGES YOU CAN DIRECT. TO THOSE OFFICES OR- ALL RIGHT A PASSING. PASSING THROUGH. AND IN TERMS OF- PARTNERSHIP WE'VE HAD- TERMS OF. ARM I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE AS I MENTIONED ON THE BALLOT JUSTICE NOW MY CORE AREA- BUT OUT THERE FOLKS ARE TEAMS WHO WORK VERY CLOSELY IN THIS- ARENA AND CAN SPEAK TO THAT BUT ALSO TO MY A COLLEAGUE ACTUALLY. DEFEATED IMPEACHMENT ADD TO THAT QUESTION. SURE THE END THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE YOU KNOW MANY COMMUNITY BENEFITS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ORGANIZATIONS EXIST LIKE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL THAT CAN DO ENFORCEMENT WORK AND- OR PARTNER WITH APPROPRIATE LEGAL ORGANIZATIONS YOU IMPORTANT FORCE NETWORK SO LEADERSHIP COUNCIL REPRESENTED CONCERNED CITIZENS OF WEST FRESNO FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS. DARLING INGREDIENTS CASE THAT I SHARED AND- WE'VE ALSO WORKED WITH RESIDENTS ON THE AMAZON WAREHOUSE ISSUE BUT IT IS A RESOURCE ISSUE WERE HAVINGAN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM FUNDS LIKE THESE WOULD BE. REALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY VIOLATIONS AND- THAT COULD BE PURSUED AND SHOULD BE PURSUED I'M AND ONE ADDITIONAL- SUGGESTION I WOULD OFFER IN ADDITION. ALONG WITH WHAT CAN WAS OFFERING ITS POTENTIALLY ENHANCED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDS FLOW TO LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICES. JUST MAKING SURE WE HAVE A STRONG SYSTEM IN PLACE TO REALLY ENSURE THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING USED AND- THE WAY THAT COMMUNITIES WANT THEM TO BE USED IN AND SEE THEIR HIGHEST VALUE OF THESE. THANK YOU. FOR THAT THANK AS THERE I WILL SAY WHEN YOU WERE DESCRIBING THE- DATA CARCASSES AND THE SMELLS THAT HAD SOME FLASHBACKS TO WHEN I WAS TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL AND- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MEAT RENDERING PLANTS NOT TOO FAR INTO THAT SMELL- WAS SOMETHING WE HAD TO CONTEND WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS. AS WELL AND SO. ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK TO HELP. TO HELP THE COMMUNITY INVEST THOUGH IT'S- IT WAS ALWAYS HARD TO TRY TO BE A TEACHER TO STUDENT ON WHEN THAT WAS LINGERING IN THE SUMMER- SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT WORK- MY L. A. PAUL I. HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION FOR ON OF ITS- OR OR THE I DON'T IS THAT WE HAVE HERE. DO WE KNOW- IF ANY OF THESE PHONES WERE BEING USED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES OUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW ARM. NO NO. W. WITH LARGEST PANEL. OFFICE THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULDN'T BE TO THE- TO SPEAK TO- IF THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT MADAM CHAIR WAS INTERESTED AND I THINK THE KEY THING FROM THE AUDIT WHAT IS THAT HE'S DOLLARS WHICH WERE RESTRICTED WERE BEING USED- BY THAT BUT FOR THEIR GENERAL FUND THEIR UNRESTRICTED PURPOSES AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DESCRIBE WAS CERTAINLY FALL WITHIN THAT CATEGORY OF UNRESTRICTED- DOLLARS WHERE YOU WOULD WANT. ABSOLUTE FLEXIBILITY. YES I THINK IT IS REALLY IT REALLY PERPLEXED- TO HAVE. AN AGENCY OR GROUP OF. APART PUBLIC SAFETY INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE MISS YOU SEEN FUNDS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP A PUBLIC HEALTH- AND- WELL WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS AND WE DON'T HAVE CD HERE- IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION OF WHETHER PRIORITIES ARE AT. WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL. MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK. EXCUSE ME- I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE LOS ANGELES FEDERATION LABOR WHICH BASICALLY I KNOW WHEN TO TALK ABOUT MORE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL- FUNDING THAT WAS GIVEN BUT THERE WAS ALSO A CONCERN ABOUT THE CDA WORKING ON WORKING CONDITIONS WAGE THEFT AND- UNION BUSTING THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT- ESPECIALLYIN THE DISTRICTS THAT I COME FROM- WE HAVE A LARGE MANUFACTURING IN IN SOUTH LA. AND THE SURROUNDING AREA. AND WE DURING COLD IT. THERE WERE EMPLOYERS THAT DID NOT. FOLLOW THE COBIT PROTOCOL ARE HAD NONE AT ALL. PEOPLE DIED. A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED BECAUSE OF EMPLOYERS WHO DID NOT EVEN CONSIDER THAT THE WORKING TODAY CONDITIONS THAT THEY'RE INDIVIDUALS WERE IN- COULD NOT ONLY CAUSE HARM COULD CAUSE DEATH. I DON'T REMEMBER. THE DA'S OFFICE LIKE GOING IN AND REALLY PROSECUTING PEOPLE WHO IN SOME WAYS HAVE COMMITTED SOME OF THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES AYE I THINK YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO IS ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET COBIT NINETEEN AND DIE. BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO KEEP THE MANUFACTURING PLANTS GOING AND THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS MOSTLY LATINO. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE WELFARE AND SAFETY I WOULD THINK THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT PLACE THAT'S THE DA'S OFFICE WOULD PLAY IN. AND I DON'T REMEMBER A WHOLE LOT OF ACTIVITY NOT ONLY MY DISTRICT BUT BUT STATEWIDE SO I I'M KIND OF CURIOUS THAT IT MENTIONS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PORTION OF IT. BUT ALSO READ THAT THERE'S SOME THINGS IN YOUR ABOUT MOM WORKER SAFETY AND THE LABOR AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE IT CAN YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE BREAKDOWNIS OR R. OR IS THIS THAT YOU WERE MENTIONING OTHER POTS. IS THIS ANOTHER POT THAT WE NEED TO DO AN AUDIT ON OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF IN THAT TWO POINT NINE MILLION- CAN ANYBODY ANSWER. THAT THANK ANALYSTS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ALICE OFFICE SO THE AUDITOR THAT WAS HIRED TO DO THE EXTERNAL AUDIT REVIEWED THE CDA PROGRAMS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL ARENA AS WELL AS THE WORKER HEARING OUT SO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM SIR WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP- IN TERMS OF OUR HAND OUT WHEN WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF STATE FUNDING. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND- EXAMPLES IN IN RECENT YEARS OF STATE FUNDS GOING TO THE WORKER SAFETY PROGRAMS THE SAME WAY THAT MONIES WENT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS. THAT BEING SAID IN THE REVIEW OF THE AUDIT THERE WERE MONIES THAT WERE GOING TO THE WORKER SAFETY PROGRAMS AND SO THEY ARE LIKELY COMING FROM JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS. THAT ARE BEING PURSUED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- AND THE FUNDS ARE FLOWING IN THAT WAY AND SO. ON THE FINAL PIECE OF YOUR QUESTION THE TWO POINT NINE MILLION AND- THAT IS- IS A COMBINATION OF WHAT IS OWED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IT COUNTS. AS WELL AS TO THE WORKER SAFETY ACCOUNTS IF YOU LIKE A PARTICULAR BREAKDOWN I THINK WE HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE ON IT BECAUSE I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT READILY AT MY FINGERTIPS AT THIS MOMENT BUT WE CAN. CERTAINLY WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AND I WOULD LOVE. TO SEE A BREAKOUT M. IN ADDITION TO IT I MEAN IT'S HARD TO HAVE A FULL DISCUSSION. WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE OTHER SIDE HERE. AND I. DON'T KNOW IF IT'S APPROPRIATE BUT I I'VE ONLY HAD LIMITED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ABOUT THIS WITH CDA. AT THE- MMHM I. THERE WERE ABOUT LEADING. AND THINGS THAT NATURE BUT IT. IS THERE MUST'VE BEEN SOME. BACK TO YOUR DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHY. THEY FEEL THAT. THEY MAY HAVE SPENT THE MONIES IN A CERTAIN WAY THEY CAN CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT OR ARE WE IN THE SAME POSITION OF LITIGATION YOU DON'T WANT TO. SAY ANYTHING THAT COULD BE USED. FOR OR AGAINST THEM- GOOD LUCK I. DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR POSITION IS REALLY. SENATE ONLY AGAIN WHAT THE L. A. L. JUST JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR FOR THOSE FOR LISTENING WE DID NOT DO THE AUDITS- THE AUDIT WAS CONDUCTED BY A PRIVATE COMPANY- CALL COMING IN MORRIS AND SO. I WE WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT CONVERSATIONS MAY HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN CA AND HAVING A MORRIS- WHICH IS KIND OF THE TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIP- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FEEDBACK TO AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS- WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH CDA AND STATE DEPARTMENTS AS WE WERE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CANNOT TO KIND OF HELP INFORM THAT- I WOULD SAY THAT THE CONVERSATIONS WERE FOR FALL- BUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION MAKES THINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF WHAT INFORMATION CAN OR CANNOT BE SHARED. OKAY THE THANK YOU IT IS IT IS A- DIFFICULT GETTING GETTING SOME FEEDBACK FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND I HOPE THAT WE DO WE GET SOMETHING BACK TO THE WEEKEND OBVIOUSLY RESOLVE THIS- BECAUSE WHAT WHEN I'M LEVY WITHIN MY STATEMENT AS A DISS WE NEED TO BE A- TO DO THEIR JOB- I LIVE NEAR THE BOTTOM MY DISTRICT IS WHAT IS. CLASSICALLY CALLED THE CORRUPT CRESCENT AND THERE CITIES IN WHICH WE NEED TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO GO AHEAD BECAUSE THERE'S- THERE'S FINANCIAL MALFEASANCE THAT'S GOING ON IN. EPIC PROPORTIONS- WHERE D. THE MONIES THAT ARE. DEBT MAY BE STOLEN IS PROBABLY EQUAL TO OR NEAR WHAT. THEIR BUDGET IS AND- AND SO WHAT THEY NEED PROTECTION. AND THEN THEY NEED TO HAVE THE DA'S OFFICE- DIRECTOR LIKE IN MY AREA THINGS TO POLITICAL INTEGRITY UNIT PUBLIC INTEGRITY UNIT THE NEED TO GO IN THERE AND DO THOSE TYPE OF. INVESTIGATIONS SO THAT WE CAN KEEP GOVERNMENT HONEST AND SO- I WOULD I WOULD HOPE THAT. WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN GET THAT KIND OF ASSURANCE BECAUSE IT IT IS PROBLEMATIC ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND- HOPEFULLY WE CAN. WE CAN GET BEYOND THIS BUT THIS IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT THAT WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE SO I JUST WANNA THANK YOU CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU AND AGAIN CDA WAS INVITED UP THE- DECLINE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE OF- THAT OCCASION ISSUES POTENTIALLY- AND SO WHILE IT IS- INCOMPLETE PICTURE THAT WE ARE GETTING A STILL I STILL THOUGHT THAT IT MERITED A DISCUSSION WITH WITH OUR COLLEAGUES HERE MR STONE. THANK YOU IN AN AND I THINK IT DOES. BUT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO DISTINGUISH HERE BETWEEN CDA WAS ORGANIZATION AND- LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR OFFICES BECAUSE AS FAR AS I KNOW. WITH THIS. AUDIT THE pIMPLICATED THIS IS THE ORGANIZATION CDA. WHICH SITS IN AN INTERESTING POSITION IN THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN THIS THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS THAT THINGS LIKE THIS HAVE HAPPENED WHERE. WE HAVE. A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION. THAT IS GETTING. PUBLIC MONEY BUT HAS CONFLICTING OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND I SUBMIT THAT THIS IS PRETTY INDICATIVE OF SOME SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL PROBLEMS WITHIN CDA WHERE THEY BLITHELY TAKE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE PUBLIC MONIES COMING IN BORROW FROM THOSE ACCOUNTS TO BE USED FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT THEY THEMSELVES CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION. THAT ENGAGES POLITICALLY ACROSS THE STATE AND ENGAGES IN ADVOCACY FOR SPECIFIC POSITIONS SO ONE HAS TO ASSUME WITHOUT OTHER INFORMATION THAT MONEY IS BEING BORROWED FOR FROM LEGITIMATE ACCOUNTS TO PERFORM SPECIFIC SERVICES GIVEN TO THEM PUBLIC MONIES GIVEN TO THEM TO THEN PERFORM MORE OF PRIVATE ORGANIZATION. ACTIVITIES THE LOBBYING THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND OTHER THINGS THIS IS CLASSIC MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN ORGANIZATIONS ORGANIZATIONS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESPONSE THAT THEY HAVE DONE SO FAR WITH THE AUDITOR POINTING OUT THAT CDA HAS TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS THAT TO FOLLOWS THE SAME PATTERN WHERE IT'S OH MY GOSH WE FOUND SOMETHING WRONG HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WHICH IS AS MINIMAL AS THEY THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH. IN ORDER TO RECOVER THE MONEY IS THE PROBLEM FOR US THOUGH IS THIS IS SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC DOLLARS THREE MILLION. OF MISAPPROPRIATED FUNDS. AND A SEEMINGLY VERY CAVALIER ATTITUDE TOWARDS THAT MISAPPROPRIATION SO THAT'S WHY IT IN WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT IS CLEARLY A CULTURAL. PROBLEM THAT SHOULD LEAD TO SOME SIGNIFICANT SHAKE UP NOT JUST. MINOR CHANGING OF POLICIES AND A COMMITMENT TO PAY BACK MONEY THEY HAVE IS THE AUTHOR POINT OR IS THAT ELLIE- POINTS OUT. OTHER WAYS TO RAISE MONEY. TO REMEDY THIS BUT THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T SEEM INTERESTED IN COMING UP WITH A SERIOUS WAY OF REMEDYING IT AND JUST SORT OF PAYING OFF IT AS THEY CAN. FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT SHOWS TO ME A LACK OF SERIOUSNESS AND YEAH THAT'S NOT JUST. LOOKING AT THIS ORGANIZATION BUT HAVING SEEN THE SAME KIND OF ORGANIZATION. REACH THESE PROBLEMS IN IN THE PAST AND SO THEIR PATTERNS OR THE SAME AS WE HAVE SEEN SO I THINK THEY HAVE SOME VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT INTERNAL. PROBLEMS THAT THEY NEED TO OWN UP TO. AND DEAL WITH. ACCORDING TO THE AUDIT REPORT THAT THE L. A. WAS WAS LOOKING AT THEY'VE BEEN HAVING SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEM SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. AND SHOWS. CHOSE TO DEAL WITH THAT BY BORROWING. FROM PUBLIC DOLLARS TO PAY FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT WE PROBLEMATIC AS A MISUSE OF FUNDS MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS AND A REAL PROBLEM AGAIN POINTED TO SOME VERY KIND OF A CAVALIER ATTITUDE A INTERNAL CULTURAL PROBLEM WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY- LOOK AT MONEY HOW THEY WANT TO MANAGE MONEY AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM CLEARLY WHAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO THEM. FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE MONEY WAS RECEIVED BY CDA AT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO THEM WERE THOSE PROGRAMS THAT THEY DIVERTED THOSE FUNDS TO THAT THEY LOANED THE FUNDS TO WITHOUT ANY PLAN. FOR PAYING THEM BACK. AGAIN CLASSIC KIND OF INTERNAL. EITHER WHILE CULTURAL PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO ME COULD BE INCOMPETENCE BUT I THINK THIS WAS A PLANNED WAY BUT BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PLAN FOR COMING OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THIS THERE'S SOME REAL STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THERE SO WHAT CAN WE DO I THINK WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THIS RECEIVED THE MONEY AND WE CAN CHANGE THAT BY ENSURING THAT THE MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THE RECIPIENT ORGANIZATIONS RATHER THAN FEEDING IT THROUGH AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS SHOWN. THAT THEY WILL USE THAT MONEY FOR PURPOSES WHICH GO COUNTER TO WHAT THE IT THAT INVESTMENT IN THAT AGENCY WAS IN AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE STATE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO CDA WOULD EXPECT THEM AND TRUST THEM TO GET THAT MONEY OUT TO THE LOCAL PROSECUTING OFFICES FOR BEST RESULTS AND DO THAT KIND OF TRAINING. BUT THIS IS BEEN A SYSTEMIC ISSUE WITHIN THAT ORGANIZATION SINCE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THAT THAT THEY HAVE HAD HAVE NOT REPORTED IT DID NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE INTERNAL CONTROLS. SO HOW MUCH CAN WE TRUST THAT ORGANIZATION TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS. I DON'T KNOW. BUT WE ARE THE ONES DOING THE OVERSIGHT WE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT MONEY GOES WHERE IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO. BYE MORE DIRECT ALLOCATIONS AS AS WAS MENTIONED. BY SOME OF THE WITNESSES AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE TAKING A LOOK AT. AND AS A- POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR ENSURING THAT WE DO NOT LEAVE WITHIN. A SUSPECT ORGANIZATION THE TEMPTATION TO CONTINUE TO TAKE MONEY AND NOT BE RESPONSIBLE UNTIL THEY COME UP WITH THE REAL PLAN. TO PAY THIS MONEY BACK AND PAY IT BACK. NOW THAT THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE SPECTER OF THIS MONEY JUST CAVALIERLY SAY WELL WE'LL PAY IT BACK OVER THIRTY YEARS AS WE GET. REVENUES TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK. NOT ACCEPTABLE THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH A BETTER PLAN FOR THAT. SO THIS IS TO ME. AN INDICATION OF A VERY UNHEALTHY ORGANIZATION WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT. CULTURAL ISSUES ON HOW IT'S MANAGED AND A REAL CAVALIER ATTITUDE TOWARDS ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY HOW IT SPENDS PUBLIC DOLLARS. AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE SHOULD BE TAKING A LOOK AT. AT OTHER MECHANISMS I'M NOT SURE HOW WE DO THAT AT THIS POINT. YEAH BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT THAT WE HAVE STATE. YOU TO TAKE SOME. ACTIONS ON. AIR AND DO SOME INVESTIGATION AS TO WHERE THOSE MONIES ARE COMING FROM HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT THERE'S SOME DIRECT ALLOCATION. AS WE LOOK AT THAT POTENTIAL MALFEASANCE IN A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION. WHO AND THEY THEY COULD HAVE BEEN HERE THEY COULD PROVIDE INFORMATION WE DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS A CRIMINAL CASE. THERE'S A JUST AN INVESTIGATION THAT'S GOING ON SO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT SURE WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. BUT THERE IS INDICATION THAT THIS IS VERY VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AB MISAPPROPRIATION OF. A LOT OF MONEY. SO I APPRECIATE BUT I'M SURE THAT YOU BRING THIS FORWARD AND WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS GOES. THANK YOU MR STONE- AND- YOU KNOW IT THE WITH WITH ANY TO PAY THE MONEY BACK NOW. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ENOUGH BECAUSE IN THE MISAPPROPRIATION OF THE DOLLARS THEY WEREN'T DOING THEIR JOB TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH. ARE PROTECT THE EMPLOYEES AND SO I THINK WE TAKE THAT INTO INTO ACCOUNT THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT IS OWED AND IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION IF PUBLIC FUNDS SHOULD BE GOING TO A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION. OF THAT HAS A QUARTER LIKE YOU SAY THAT. YOU KNOW TWO THOUSAND FOR AT LEAST SEVENTEEN YEARS ABOUT ALSO THAT ENGAGES IN A LOT OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY WHICH IS WHAT WHAT TROUBLED ME I DO NOT WANT TO SEE PUBLIC FUNDS BEING USED FOR POLITICAL- CAMPAIGNS OUT THERE WE KNOW THAT THEIR AGGRESSIVELY ENGAGE IN THOSE CAMPAIGNS. IN BIG DOLLARS A MONTH I EVERY CYCLE- AND I DO ALSO HAVE THE QUESTION OF WHY TOOK SEVENTEEN YEARS TO. TO UNCOVER THE SITUATION SINCE IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR AT LEAST ALONG WITH THIS BUT THIS FUND AND THEY DID ASK THE QUESTION OF WHAT OTHER FUNDS- AND SO I DO THINK AS- AS THE LEGISLATURE WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO. ENSURE THE FUNDS ARE BEING USED APPROPRIATELY AND THAT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AT THIS ORGANIZATION- AND I- A- WONDER. REALLY WHY UNTIL OF. IN ANALYSTS BUT I DO I THINK THE L. A. L. THEY DID GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A PICTURE OF HOW THIS ORGANIZATION WORKS I AND I WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS TO HELP UNCOVER THIS- AND HAVE CONTINUED TO SHED A LIGHT ON THIS INTO THE ADVOCACY GROUPS UP UNDERGROUND JUST I THANK YOU FOR. YOUR CONTINUED WORK IN THE SPACE. OF THEIR OF THEIR NUMBER QUESTIONS. IN THIS- FOR THIS PANEL AND THEN MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL.

SO YOU SHOULD SEE A HAND OUT- ALL THE SENTENCING DIVERSION AND REENTRY PROGRAMS- AND IT'S AVAILABLE- ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE UNDER THE PUBLICATIONS HAVE AS WELL AS ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S WEBSITE WHERE YOU ACCESS THE AGENDA FOR FOLKS THE FOLLOWING ALONG NICELY. AND IT'S GOING TO THE FIRST PAGE- JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW OF MY PRESENTATION I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE- A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SELECTED RECENT STATE POLICY CHANGES AND FUNDING THAT SUPPORT RESENTENCING OF PEOPLE TO REDUCE SENTENCES DIVERSION PROGRAMS WHICH TECH TYPICALLY PROVIDE. REHABILITATION SERVICES IN LIEU OF INCARCERATION- AND REENTRY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT SERVICES TO PEOPLE TRANSITIONING FROM INCARCERATION TO THE COMMUNITY. IN ON PAGE TWO- BEGINS THE LIST OF SELECTED POLICY CHANGES- WHICH STARTS WITH PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN. WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT DRUG POSSESSION AND THEFT RELATED CRIMES FROM FELONIES TO MISDEMEANORS AND ALSO ALLOWED FOR RESENTENCING OF FOLKS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONVICTED OF THOSE CRIMES. AND THE MEASURE REQUIRES THAT 65% OF THE STATE SAVINGS RESULTING FROM THE SENTENCING CHANGES AT SO LARGELY- THAT SAVINGS FROM STATE. THE REDUCTION IN THE STATE PRISON POPULATION BE DIRECTED TO THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS FOR GRANTS THE PUBLIC AGENCIES TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND SENSE LEGISLATION THAT WAS. PASSED OUT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO THAT FUNDING AS SUCH AS REQUIRING THAT BCC DISTRICT DISTRIBUTE THE GRANTS AND COMPETITIVE PROCESS AND PRIVATE PAADISE CERTAIN. PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO WHAT PROPERTY SEVEN REQUIRED SUCH AS- PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. I'M AND THEN TO DATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE PROGRAM-AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASSUMES THAT AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY FOUR MILLION WILL BE PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE NEXT CATEGORY OR THE- THAT YEAH THE NEXT CATEGORY OF CHANGES HAS BEEN RECENT EXPANSIONS TO- COURTS AT THE READY TO RE SENTENCE JAIL AND PRISON INMATES AND- THAT EXPANSION WAS ACT CREATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH- SOME BUDGET LEGISLATION- AND ALLOW COURTS TO CONSIDER POST CONVICTION FACTORS SUCH AS INMATES DISCIPLINARY RECORDS ARE PROGRAMS THEY PARTICIPATE IN MODERN CARS ARE RATED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO REDUCE AN INMATE'S SENTENCE UPON RECOMMENDATION BY A PRISON OR JAIL ADMINISTRATOR. AND THE BUDGET IN THAT YOU'RE ALSO PROVIDED SOME ONGOING RESOURCES FOR CDC ARE TO IDENTIFY- INMATES AND PROPOSE THEM TO THE COURTS FOR RESENTENCING. AND THEN- ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION THAT YEAR EXPANDED THE BILL- EXPANDED TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS- THE ABILITY TO RECOMMEND INMATES THE COURTS FOR RESENTENCING UNDER THIS PROCESS. LIVING ON TO PAGE THREE- THERE WERE A COUPLE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION ALSO IN- TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE FIRST WAS- LEGISLATION THAT AUTHORIZED A TRIAL COURT JUDGES TO GRANT PRE TRIAL DIVERSION IN MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY CASES IN WHICH- THE JUDGE DETERMINES THAT THE DEFENDANT'S MENTAL ILLNESS- WAS A SIGNATURE SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION AND THE- DEFENSE. I'M UNDER THAT PROCESS DEFENDANTS. RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY FOR UP TO TWO YEARS AND UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM HAVE THEIR CHARGES DISMISSED- ALSO IN THAT YEAR THAT. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT- PROVIDED A ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS TO CONTRACT THE COUNTIES TO ESTABLISH DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR DEFENDANTS. CHARGED WITH FELONIES SPECIFICALLY THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND SO THAT NEEDS FUNDS ESSENTIALLY CAN THINK OF THEM AS SUPPORTING A SUBSET- OF. OF PEOPLE DIVERTED UNDER THE CHAPTERS CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR AND ONE OH FIVE LEGISLATION- BECAUSE THAT INCLUDED A FELONY AND MISDEMEANORS AS WELL AS FELONIES WHERE IS THAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION IS SPECIFICALLY FOR. FOLKS LIKE WOULD BE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND- CHARGED WITH A FELONY. I AM ALSO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN- BUDGET ACT THE WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE ADULT REENTRY GRANT WAS CREATED- WITH INITIAL FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND- ALLOCATION FOR THE SEC TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE GRANTS. TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO. FIND REENTRY SERVICES INCLUDING RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE COMING OUT OF STATE PRISON. AND THAT IT SAID TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ACT AT BUDGET ACT PROVIDED AT THIRTY SEVEN MILLION I'M GOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THIS PROGRAM. MOVING ON TO PAGE FOUR- THE IT. AB THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT ALSO INCLUDED FUNDING FOR DIVERSION OF YOUTH FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND KNOWN AS THE YOUTH RANCH AT THE THREE ENTRY- EXCUSE ME- AT. IT ANOTHER GRANT PROGRAM- WHERE AT DIVERTING CHIU FROM YOUTH FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM EXCUSE ME- AND THAT WAS THIRTY SEVEN MILLION A MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS ADMINISTERED BY THE SEC TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBES- AND THAT WAS- FINDING WAS THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING- WAS APPROPRIATE IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ACT FOR THE PROGRAM AND THAT WAS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. ALSO IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY- THE BUDGET PROVIDED FUNDING FOR SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT A DIVERSION PROGRAM OPERATED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND THEN FINALLY THE LAST- SO I CHANGE I WOULD. WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT HERE TODAY IS RELATED TO MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION WHICH IS QUITE RECENT-IT WAS A LEGISLATION APPROVED IN TWENTY TWENTY- THAT AUTHORIZED TRIAL COURT JUDGES CHOPPER DIVERSION TO DEFENDANTS IN MISDEMEANOR CASES OVER THE OBJECTION OF PROSECUTORS- AGAIN IF. A DEFENDANT'S PARTICIPATE IN- AND COMPLY WITH THE TERMS SET BY THE JUDGE- DATE. WILL HAVE THEIR CHARGES DISMISSED. AND THAT IS THE END OF THE PREPARED COMMENTS I HAVE AND WILL PASS IT ON TO THE NEXT ANALYSTS AND HAPPY TO TAKE. QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. SO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING- I'M DINA BACK IN DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. I AM VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT- SHRINKING OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION ALSO TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO. REDUCE RECIDIVISM- IT'S NO SECRET THAT IN THE UNITED STATES HAS THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATE IN THE WORLD. AND AS PROSECUTORS WE ARE THE GATE KEEPERS OF THE LEGAL JEFF IF WITH THEM SO THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO USE OUR LIMITED RESOURCES THE PUBLIC RESOURCES THAT WE ARE CONTRACTED WITH. TO WISELY USE THEM TO PROMOTE NOT ONLY PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALSO TO REDUCE HARM. AND THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING TODAY ARE OFTEN BEST SERVED BY KEEPING PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO COMMIT LOW LEVEL OFFENSIVE OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BY USING DIVERSION AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION SO I LIFTED UP ON MY FLIGHT A NUMBER. OF PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE USED IN MY OFFICES THAT ARE USED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WELL- IN THE LIMITED TIME THAT WE HAVE TODAY I WON'T TRY TO HIGHLIGHT ALL OF THEM- CERTAINLY IF THEY'RE THE ONES THAT I DON'T MENTION SPECIFICALLY- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE. ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HER WHEN THE APPROPRIATE. TIME KIND. SO COULD HAVE THE NEXT FLIGHT PLEASE. THE FIRST ONE THAT I LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT. ARE TWIST JEFF TO HER PROGRAM IN SHRINKING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ONE OF THE PLACES THAT- I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT STARTING IS WITHOUT YOU. BECAUSE CERTAINLY ARGUES- WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE PIPELINE THAT LEADS OUR KIDS FROM SCHOOL TO PERFORM AND WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO ARGUES THAT. WE CAN BREAK THAT PIPELINE- ENCONTRABAN COUNTY WE APPLIED FOR AND WERE AWARDED TO BE A FIFTY GRANT OF A MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THAT WE COULD ESTABLISH A JUVENILE DIVERSION WE FILING PROGRAM. I DIVERSION PROGRAM IS THE FIRST- IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH A COMMUNITY YOUTH CENTER AN ORGANIZATION CALLED IMPACT JUSTICE. TO INITIATE A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAM THE REDIRECT OUR YOUTH FROM THE JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BUT THEY ALSO GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED INCLUDE INCLUDING SERVICE PROVIDER CHAMA. TO REDUCE THE PIPELINE INTO OUR SYSTEM TO LOWER RECIDIVISM AND ALSO REDUCE DISPARITIES- WE HAVE FOUND IN OUR COUNTY THAT WE HAVE RACIAL. AND EQUITY ISSUES IN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SO PIECE OF POLICIES ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL. THE OTHER THING WE I HAVE WHICH IS A ROOM THAT IS ACTUALLY. OUR YOU JUSTICE- SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE MY EFFECTIVE WAY. TO INVEST IN OUR JUST WITH THE BALL THROUGH RISK JUSTICE AND COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS. WE'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PER CHILD TO KEEP THEM LOCKED UP. AND OFTEN THOSE- ALTERNATIVES RESULT IN WORSE OUTCOMES. FOR CHILDREN IN OUR FAMILY- WE HAVE ALL USED PROSECUTORIAL. AWAY FROM CHARGING A CERTAIN OFFENSES PARTICULARLY IN OUR ADULT SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE WITH THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM DRUG ADDICTION AND THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. WHAT THE FENCES BOB FOR THE FIRST ON A FEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE TO- HAVE A PERSON COMING INTO OUR OFFICE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN ARRESTED WE ARE NOW SENDING THOSE CASES INTO TREATMENT PARTNERING WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO DO SO- AND I THINK THE FINAL ONE THAT I WOULD LIFT ACTIVATE. ITS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT RECIDIVISM REDUCING RECIDIVISM- WE- I WOULD. ARE USING OUR OUR POWER OF OUR OFFICE NOT ONLY TO. GET RID OF ALL FELONY AND MISDEMEANOR CONVICTIONS THAT ARE ON RCORD THAT PEOPLE KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY KEEP THEM OUT OF JOBS AND SO FORTH. BUT ALSO USING A POWER UNDER THE MORE RECENT LEGISLATION. ON POST CONVICTION BE SENTENCING TO TAKE A LOOK BACK AT ALL THREATEN FOR THE RECOMMENDED THE COURTS CHANGES. SO I THINK THAT IN ADDITION TO. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE TRAINING IN PLACE WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE VERA INSTITUTE- ARE THAT IT'S A PARTNERSHIP THAT ALLOWS US TO USE THAT DATA TO TAKE A CRITICAL LOOK AT OUR OWN DECISION MAKING. AND TO USE THAT DATA TO DRIVE OUR POLICIES GOING FORWARD AS WE ALSO FIFTY IN RACIAL AND IMPLICIT. BIAS IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO I THINK IN THAT TIME THAT WE HAVE A- I ALSO MY REMARKS THERE- IF YOU WILL CLICK THAT FLY YOU'LL BE A TO SEE ALL OF THE OTHER CHART- THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE. IF WE CAN HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REMAINING- FIVE. ALBANY PUBLIC TIME THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE THREE BERBER SELF ARE AVAILABLE. IF YOU START TALKING A POP UP ON THE SCREEN. THEY KNOW CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME. YES YEAH OKAY GREAT SUPER SO THANKYOU BECAUSE WITHOUT THE LEGISLATION EVEN GIVING US IN THE TOOLS THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVING US WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CHANGE THAT OUR COMMUNITY SO DESPERATELY NEED SO IF I MAKE A PAGE TO- WE HAD TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHO WE ARE WHAT WE WERE DOING AND THE IMPACT THAT WE HAD ON THE COMMUNITY. AND WE HAD TO REIMAGINE OUR APPROACH TO MEET THOSE CORE OBJECTIVES AND SO WE SAID TO OURSELVES WHAT WE REALLY GOING TO DO HERE WE HAVE TO REDUCE CRIME I COME FROM SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY WE HAVE A HIGH RATIO CRIME HERE WE HAVE HIGH ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AND WE NEED TO REDUCE THAT CRIME THAT IMPACT OUR COMMUNITY AND REDUCE OUR RECIDIVISM RATE. AND WE NEED TO DO SO BECAUSE WE'RE PREVENTING VICTIMIZATION AND SPY STRENGTHENING OUR FAMILIES AND OUR YOUTH AND THE STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE END MUSIN EBELING THEM WORK AND EMPLOYMENT SO THESE WERE KEY FACTORS IN DARK DRIVING WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THANKS TO THE LEGISLATION IN THE VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVES WE'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS IN THIS AREA SO LET ME FIRST AGAIN THANK YOU. NEXT PAGE PLEASE. SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CONTINUE APPROACH TO JUSTICE WHAT ARE WE DOING. AND WE EVEN GO FURTHER BACK INTO PREVENTION AND IT AND IT INTERVENTION AND- EDUCATION. WE SPEAK TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS AND ADULTS EVERY YEAR PRE COBIT- WITHOUT ALLOWED US TO REALLY GET IN THERE TRYING TO DO AS MUCH PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SCHOOLS. AS WE COULD. WE GOT IT WE GOT IT OUR TRUANCY AND WE CHANGED OUR APPROACH TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ON CAMPUSES. IN ORDER TO GET A MORE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. AND BUILD THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AT TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY. AS WELL AS PREVENTING THEM INDIVIDUALS BECOME BECOMING GOT INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THEN AT THE DEFLECTION PERIOD. LOWER LEVEL BEHAVIORS RESULTING IN PROGRAM REFERRALS OR SCHOOLS OR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR YOUTH ARE HOMELESS AND FAMILIES. ARE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT OUR COMMUNITY SEES EVERY DAY AS YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE WANT US TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE PEOPLE FOR POVERTY DRIVEN- FENCES. SO WE REALLY HAD TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND SAY OKAY WHAT ARE WE DOING AND HOW IS THAT MAKING OUR COMMUNITY BETTER. BY BRINGING SOMEBODY IN FOR AN OFFENSE THAT REALLY NEEDS PROGRAMMING SUCH AS SUBSTANCE USE MENTAL HEALTH AND POVERTY. AND SO WE CHANGED OUR APPROACH TO THAT AND DEFLECTED AS MANY CASES AS WE COULD. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ARRESTED COLLECTION PROGRAM. AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER COMMUNITY AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO LIFT PEOPLE UP. INSTEAD OF INFLICTING MORE HARM FOR WHICH THEY CAN NEVER GET OUT FROM UNDER SO WE REALLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON HOW DO WE DO THIS PRE ARREST MOTION. AND THEN DIVERSION. OKAY PREC PRE CONVICTION WERE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND AT FIRST WE THOUGHT LET'S LOOK AT YOU KNOW THAT'S A YOUNG GROUP SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY. AND I GETS A FELONY CONVICTION GETS A FELONY CHARGE. HOW CAN WE PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIX SEVEN EIGHT DECADES. OF THIS INDIVIDUAL LIVING WITH THIS FELONY CONVICTION ON HIS OR HER THEIR THEM'S RAP. AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO THEM. TO THEIR FAMILY TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THE ECONOMICS OF IT ALL AND SO WE REALLY LOOKED. AT THAT GROUP NOW WE'VE EXPANDED TO THIRTY THANKS TO THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A THE LAST. GAVE US. AND NOW WORK. IT INTO FAMILIES. STORE ARE ACTUALLY GONNA TAKE THE MONEY THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US ON OUR DIVERSION PROGRAM PNCC IN THE CUP PNCC PLUS WE'RE MOVING INTO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AN AREA THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO INTO. BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATER HARM. BUT IN REALITY THERE'S NO ONE AREA WHERE WE CAN DO MORE GREAT WORK THEN RIGHT THERE. BECAUSE WE SEE IN THESE HOMES WHERE THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH ISSUES. THAT THE ENTIRE FAMILY. NOT ONLY THOSE LIVING IN THE HOUSE THE GRANDPARENTS AND UNCLES AND AUNTS AND COUSINS AND NEPHEWS IN THE NEIGHBOR'S. AND THE PEOPLE ON THE BLOCK ARE ALL IMPACTED. BY A HOME THAT IS DEALING WITH TRAUMA. SO WE CAN GET IN THERE AND REALLY DO SOME GREAT WORK WE CAN CHANGE THE OUTCOMES AND KEEP PEOPLE FROM COMING BACK WHILE GIVING THEM THE TOOLS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL GOING FORWARD SO THIS IS A BIG AREA AS WELL THAT WE MADE HUGE MOVEMENT IN. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE OUR RECIDIVISM RATE BY HALF. IF WE DID A PILOT. OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR- COMMITTEE- I CLIENTS WHO AGAINST. INDIVIDUALS WHO OPTED NOT FOR THE PROGRAM BUT HAD SAME OR SIMILAR CHARGES SAME OR SIMILAR CRIMINAL HISTORIES. AND WE CUT OUR RECIDIVISM RATES. BY HALF. SO THIS CAN AND DOES WORK AND YOU CAN USE THESE TOOLS. TO ENHANCE INCREASE THINGS AND INTEGRATE WORK AND THE LAST THING WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THREE ENTRY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PROGRAM HERE THAT ALLOWS RETURN EXISTENCE TO HAVE A FAIR CHANCE TO CLEAN UP THE CRIMINAL RECORDS. AND GAVE ME A PHONE PROGRAM. A WE HAVE READY TO WORK WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT THEY COULD STAY UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS- RELEASE FROM BACK COUNTY JAIL. OR PAROLE AND HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR EVEN SPENDING THEIR LAST YEAR THERE. THEY CAN WORK IN THE COMMUNITY THEY DO PUBLIC SERVICE COMMUNITY WORK ALL DAY LONG THEY LEAVE WITH FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT PERMANENT HOUSING. AND RESOURCES TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE USE- THINGS LIKE OF THAT NATURE SO IT'S JUST A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. SO I WANTED TO THANK ALL OF YOU AND YOU CAN SEE ON THIS LAST PAGE I'LL JUMP OFF THE TIME I THINK IT'S EXPIRED HERE BUT- WE HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEWER YOUTH ARRESTED SAN JOAQUIN. THANKS TO PROP SIXTY FOUR STRUCTURE DIVERSION PROGRAMS TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM BY NEARLY 80% FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS. AND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND SENTENCES HAVE BEEN REDUCED WAS SENTENCED BURKE SMASHED. BUT WE ALSO TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER WITH CLEAR TEN THOUSAND BENCHMARKS. FOR OLD CASES LIKE 1-137-711-3644 POSSESSION AND POSSESSION OF A PIPE. BECAUSE PEOPLE GET ARRESTED FOR THAT OUTSTANDING BENCH WORK FROM NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN- AND THEN HAVE TO WAIT FORTY EIGHT HOURS FOR THEIR DAY IN COURT. SO THOSE KINDS OF RECORD CLEARANCE THOSE TOOLS ARE SO VALUABLE. THE OTHER THING WE REALLY DESPERATELY NEED FINES AND FEES ARE OUT OF CONTROL AND EXCESSIVE. I KNOW THERE'S MONEY COMING IN JUNE AND THAT IS FANTASTIC THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT THE FINES AND FEES WE REALLY HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO PEOPLE ECONOMICALLY- WHEN THEY'RE TRAVELING THIS AND TO REMEMBER THAT DMV IS GOING TO HIT I'M PROBABLY MOST LIKELY AS WELL. JUST A STEEP. AND THEN AUTOMATIC SEALING WE JUST NEED TO BE AUTOMATIC. GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE IF THEY HAVE HIGHER FELONY CONVICTION. AND THEN ATTACH IT FIRST OF. ARE FOR. ARE ARE BIG. IN JUSTICE FOR ALL THOSE ARE CREEK HE- AREA. SO THANK YOU THE LAST OF COURSE. THE CONFLICT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE BUT I THINK I'M NEXT. SO I'M JUST GONNA START TALKING MY NAME IS PETER HAS BEEN AWESOME THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION AND REENTRY FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ORGANIZATION THAT WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND PLACED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES. WE HAVE FOUR BUCKETS OF WORK INCLUDING OUR JAIL BASED DIVERSION. WORK WHICH I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT TODAY. OUR COMMUNITY BASED DIVERSION WORK OUR REENTRY. WORK WHICH WILL BE ADDRESSED BY THE DIRECTOR OF REENTRY SERVICES VANESSA MARTIN WHO'S JOINING ME ON THIS CALL.

THE MISSION OF THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION AND REENTRY IN REGARDS TO JAIL BASED VERSION IS TO REDUCE THE POPULATION OF INMATES IN THE COUNTY JAIL WHERE THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY SUFFER FROM SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OR ARE CO MORBID WITH THE TWO- IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT- TODAY POST CODE OR- IN THE MIDDLE OF CULVERHOUSE DEPENDING ON YOUR BILL IT. OUR POPULATION OUR DAILY CENSUS IN THE JAIL WAS REDUCED FROM SEVENTEEN THOUSAND TO AROUND FIFTEEN FELT TODAY. UNFORTUNATELY THAT POPULATION. AND MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND INMATES WHO ARE IN SOME FORM OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY. AND IT'S OUR MISSION TO HOLES MANY OF THOSE FOLKS OUT. AND GET THEM INTO SOME SORT OF THE BASE RESTORATION A COMMUNITY BASED CARE. FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS OUR PRE TRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM WHICH WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW JUDGES. AND JUST SO THE RECORD IS CLEAR ON A RETIRED JOHN CHIANG A LONGER. LONGER ON THE VENTURE WHAT DEPARTMENT OF BILLS HELLO JUDGES. DIVERT INDIVIDUALS WHOSE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF AN ONGOING MENTAL ILLNESS. OR OTHER ON MATH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. ON BECAUSE OUR- MISSION INVOLVES THE REDUCTION OF THE COUNTY JAIL POPULATION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND BECAUSE VERY FEW MISDEMEANORS ARE HELD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL. OUR WORK FOCUSES ON PEOPLE IN THE pFELONY. AND SO WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS IT'S A THREE YEAR CONTRACT. AND IT PROVIDES FOR TWO HUNDRED ONGOING SLOTS WHICH MEANS IT AT ANY GIVEN TIME WE WILL HAVE TWO HUNDRED. SOMETIMES A LITTLE MORE WHICH SHOWING A LOT OF OUR OWN MONEY TO INCREASE THAT NUMBER BUT- TWO HUNDRED. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDERGOING A DIVERSION PROGRAM. THEY ARE RELEASED TO US FOR CARE WE PROVIDE WITH HOUSING. WRAPAROUND CLINICAL SERVICES IN INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES ALL RIGHT. SO THAT. WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT. WE ADDRESS YOUR FRIEND IN A RECIDIVIST BEHAVIOR AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY MAD WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT OUR POPULATION. APICALLY HOUSE OF VERY HIGH MENTAL HEALTH SECURITY IS OUR FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY DECADES OF MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES BUT DECADES OF HOMELESSNESS- WE HAVE SERVED IN OUR TWO HUNDRED LOTS OF THIS PROGRAM IS PRETTY YOUNG IT'S WATSON TWO YEARS OLD. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN IN THE COUNTY JAIL SO AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR DIVERSION PROGRAM IN THE CASE OF THE PROJECT THAT'S- A LOT OF OUR BAD WE BRING. SOMEONE ELSE.

COUNTY I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT EVERY ENTRY INITIATIVES IN L. A. COUNTY THANK YOU AGAIN TO TERRAN KIRKSEY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING FORMER. FOR THE PRODUCTION STATUTES- AS OUR OTHER PANELISTS MENTIONED- THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT LEAD ACETATE LEGISLATION IN RECENT YEARS TO REFORM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS ALL THE COMMITMENT BY THE STATE TO REINVEST. FUNDS TO INCARCERATIONS COMMUNITIES. OPPOSITION PARTIES. AS OF THOSE ARE. THAT WE ARE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUN FOR A RE ENTRY SERVICES. THE FOCUS OF MY TESTIMONY IS OUR OUR TWO MAJOR PROP FORTY SEVEN FUNDED INITIATIVES. THE FIRST OF THE REENTRY INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROGRAM OR ARE A CMS FOR SHORT YOU'LL FORGIVE ME WITH ALL THE ACRONYMS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS- SO OUR SMS CONNECTS INDIVIDUALS. TO CASE MANAGERS CALLED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX SOCIAL SERVICE LANDSCAPE UPON RELEASE FROM CUSTODY AS WELL AS PROVIDE SUPPORT AND MOTIVATION AS THEY START REBUILDING THEIR LIVES. WHAT DISTINGUISHES IT FROM TRADITIONAL CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THAT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ARE PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE OF INCARCERATION OR CREDIBLE MESSENGERS. I'M WHO UNDERSTAND FIRST HAND WHAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH IN THE HARDSHIPS THEY FACED. BECAUSE MANY INDIVIDUALS LACK POSITIVE SUPPORT NETWORKS TO RETURN TO WHEN THEY WERE TO RUN RELEASED FROM CUSTODY. TRINITY HEALTH WORKERS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN HELPING THEM OVERCOME CHALLENGES AND STAYING ON TRACK. TO ACHIEVE THEIR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL GOALS. SINCE OUR IS A MUST- BEGAN. THREE YEARS AGO IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WE HAVE BUILT A NETWORK OF TWENTY NINE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH OVER A HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. AND SERVED ALMOST EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. A THIRD PARTY EVALUATION OF ARI CMS'S CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED WE DO HAVE SOME EARLY FINDINGS THAT SHOW THAT OUR ESTIMATES USES STRONG. RESEARCH INFORMED STRATEGIES INCLUDING GROWING CATCHMENT PRIOR TO REENTRY. CLIENT WEEKLY CLIENT INTERACTIONS SMALL CASELOADS AND EMPLOYING STAFF OF LIVED EXPERIENCE IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I'M ALSO SAYING THAT OUR ESTIMATES MAY BE WELL PLACED TO GENERATE COST SAVINGS THROUGH REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM. OUR OTHER MAJOR PROP FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED PROGRAMS CALLED SECTOR WHICH STANDS FOR THE SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE FOR THE CAREERS OF TOMORROW. SECTOR OFFER SKILLS TRAINING AND PAID WORK EXPERIENCE IN HIGH GROWTH SECTORS THAT OFFER CAREER PATHWAY OPPORTUNITIES AND FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES. SECTOR PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDES CRITICAL CHIANG WRAPAROUND SUPPORT AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS. TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AT HIGHER RISK OF RECIDIVISM BILL PROBLEM SOLVING AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS TO ENSURE SUCCESS IN THE WORKPLACE. IN ADDITION TO PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON ENGAGING AND WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS TO DEVELOP TRAININGS AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES. AND TO CHANGE MINDSETS ABOUT HIRING BETWEEN MARCH IT'S A HUGE BARRIER TO OVERCOME. SO SECTOR LAUNCHED IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WITH TEENS SIX TRINITY BATES PROVIDERS. AND ONLY A FEW SHORT MONTHS OVER TWO HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. THIRTY NINE OF WHOM HAVE COMPLETED TRAINING AND GIVEN THE CURRENT PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT WILL LIKELY EXCEED OUR PROGRAM ENROLLMENT GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED FOR THE YEAR. IN CLOSING I WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR POLICYMAKERS THAT LIKE ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER. I'M WHO HAVE FOUGHT FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. I THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO. WHAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE FUNDING WE HAVE AS MANY OF OUR PANELISTS DISCUSSED. WE ONLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET A FRACTION OF THE NEEDS SPECIAL IN L. A. COUNTY WORDS. WHICH ARE MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED TO SUSTAIN AND EXPAND OUR PROGRAMS AGAIN GIVEN THE MASSIVE SIZE AND NEEDS OF THE- POPULATION- FINALLY. AS I ALWAYS WANT TO REMIND. THAT I KNOW- I DON'T STATE TO THIS GROUP BUT- WE DO NEED TO HAVE COMPASSION AND CONTINUE TRAPPER PROGRAMS THE POLICY INFORMED BY THE EXPERIENCES. OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED AND IMPACTED BY THE CHAPLAIN- ON THIS NOTE I WOULD LIKE TO END WITH A QUOTE FROM ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. SCHERING MY LIVED EXPERIENCES OF HOW I OVERCAME ADVERSITY ADDICTION AND DISCRIMINATION IN MY OWN LIFE IT'S A TESTAMENT THAT REAL CHANGE IS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE RIGHT FOR. WHEN WE CAN RETURN TO LIFE- I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND- AND FELLOW PANELISTS TO VISIT OUR REENTRY PROGRAMS. AND THE TRANSPORTATION. OF THE MARKET. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. KEITH THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS BUT I'M ONLY GOING TO ASK WANT TO GIVE MY COLLEAGUES AN OPPORTUNITY FAST ANYMORE- END OF BOTH A- JUDGE ESPINOSA AND OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY- TORY RIVER CELLS ARE- I GUESS EVERYONE I SEE TOUCH AND IT BUT MAYBE IF I COULD HAVE ONE OF THEM ANSWER- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT INDICATES THAT. THESE PROGRAMS THE TO REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM AND BETTER PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES AND IN ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES ARE IN YOU- THERE IS CONCERNS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WERE REDUCING ACCOUNTABILITY- THAT. WERE NOT- PROTECTING THE PUBLIC OUT THERE INTO CAN YOU GUYS GIVE EITHER TO DATA- ADDED THOUGH IT'S- AND ANSWER TO THAT BUT YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THESE PROGRAMS AND HALLAM'S. ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALSO INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY. I HAVE AN ANSWER BUT I'M WILLING TO DEFER TO. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO GO FIRST IT SHOULD LARA. OKAY THANK YOU YOUR HONOR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE HAVE- SO WE WOULD WE WHAT WE DO WITH OUR PNCC PROGRAM IS WE'VE DONE IT WE'VE HAD IT FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS AND CALL NOW AND WE DID AN ANALYSIS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS. THEY STILL ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND WE HAVE BIG TO ME GAUGE MINT ARE VICTIMS ARE FULLY INFORMED OF THE PROGRAM AND ARE PART OF THE JOURNEY WITH US BECAUSE IT USED. A CD OVERWHELMING RESEARCH TELLS US ARE VICTIMS JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN SO WE'RE DOING PROPERTIES ASSAULTS GUN CASES WERE DOING SERIOUS WERE IN THE MODERATE RANGE WE'VE MOVED FROM LOW LEVEL BECAUSE WE SAW THE RISKS OF THE RESULT WE FELT CONFIDENT IN IT WITHOUT THE RESOURCES WERE BEING ADEQUATELY USED. AND NOW WE'VE MOVED TO MORE MODERATE BEHAVIOR THAT IS THAT HIGH RISK GROUP ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTY ANSWER WE DID AN ANALYSIS BASED ON INDIVIDUALS THAT IT- CAME INTO THE PROGRAM I COMPLETED THE PROGRAM VERSUS THOSE WHO DID NOT WITH SAME OR SIMILAR CHARGES IN SAME OR SIMILAR CRIMINAL HISTORY AN AGING FACTORS. AND LIKE I SAID OUR GROUP IS AS AND HALF THE RECIDIVISM RATE- AS THE GROUP THAT DID NOT ENGAGE IN THIS PROGRAMMING SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM ITS TOTALITY WE STILL HAVE THEM TAKE RESPONSIBILITY THEY WERE STILL IN COURT AND THEY STILL HAVE KNOWLEDGE THE HARM THAT THEY COMMITTED AND THE VICTIM HAD A RIGHT TO SPEAK AND DO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR THEM IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO. IF NOT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BUT THEY ALSO ALWAYS MOST CASES SENT A MESSAGE AS TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM THEIR JOURNEY AND WHAT THEIR HOPE WAS FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT NOW WE KNOW WE CAN TAKE IT TO THAT NEXT LEVEL AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO A MORE FAMILY HARM- WHICH IS THE IS A- BIG AREA BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IN A LOT A LOT OF. A PROGRAMMING IN THIS AREA THAT HAS SHOWN TO BE OF VALUE SO WE DO BELIEVE WE CAN STAND BEHIND OUR RESULTS AND WE DO BELIEVE AND I AM A DISTRICT ATTORNEY I NEVER WAS GOING TO GET INTO THIS BUSINESS TO BE IN THIS LANGUAGE. AND I'M A FIRM BELIEVER OF IT BECAUSE IF I CAN LOWER MY RECIDIVISM RATE. I CAN'T WILL KEEP VICTIMS SAFE AS WELL AT THE SAME TIME AND SE RI. SO THAT THERE IS A DATA RE. UP THERE THAT IS. THAT IT IS ORK. AND THAT RESPECT ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY IS PART OF THE JOURNEY. TOLD ME ON. TRY TO ANSWER IT FROM A DIFFERENT LENS THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE- OPERATE THAT I DIDN'T DISCUSSES OUR FELONY PRE TRIAL PROGRAM. AND WE ARE DIVERTING PEOPLE. DIVERGENCE NOT THE RIGHT WORD WE ARE ACCEPTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLED GUILTY OR BEEN PLACED ON PROBATION LOW MOSTLY FOR SERIOUS FELONIES BECAUSE OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT'S LEFT OF PEOPLE CHARGED WITH. SERIOUS CRIMES- REDUCE THIS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT OUR COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS IN THE COURT. RAMPS WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED- FOLKS WHO ARE ON PROBATION LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR FELONY. IN OUR HOUSE AND THE RAND CORPORATION. I DID A STUDY OF THIS PROGRAM AFTER ITS FIRST YEAR. BERMAN AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR POPULATION. ON IT IT HAS A HIGH MENTAL HEALTH ACUITY ALONG WITH CO MORBID S. U. D. CONDITIONS AND SO THAT THERE ARE DIFFICULT POPULATION TO MANAGE WE HAVE MANAGED TO MAINTAIN THEM AT AROUND 74% HOUSING RETENTION RATE WHICH MEANS THE COMPANY. EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN HOMELESS FOR DECADES- ANNA RECIDIVISM RATE AT THE FOREIGN BY NEW FELONY CONVICTION AROUND FIFTEEN PERCENT- BUILDER GREAT PROPERTY THAT IS DEFINITELY A PUBLIC SAFETY AND IN LINE WITH THE COUNTY IS CAREFUL WHICH JAIL LAST LOSS WITH THE. BUT I WILL. ECHO WHAT THE NET WE CERTAINLY MORE OF THESE TO REDUCE THE POPULAR IN THE JAIL. AND ONE THE DALLAS ALL SALES KNOW WE LOOK AT ALL OF OUR WORK RACIALIST REYES APPLE LINE AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT- IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HEALTHY IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL TO THAT LEFT WHICH IS NOT CHAU. ARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. MISS A LOT IF THANK YOU. I'M MY QUESTIONS ARE MAINLY AROUND PROP FORTY SEVEN AND SOME OF THE WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING INCREASES IN CRIMES THAT WE'VE SEEN AS A PERTAINS TO PROPERTY CRIME LARCENY SINCE THE PASSAGE- TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SAN JOAQUIN- AND- CONTRA COSTA- OR HAVE YOU SEEN AN INCREASE IN PROPERTY CRIME AND LARCENY. WE. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- WE DO IT WE WILL I HATE IT KNOWLEDGE IS FALL- SINCE WE'VE BEEN IN PUBLIC NIGHT TEAMFAST. WE REALLY HAVE HAD MORE PINES OF WHAT I MAKE OUR DESPERATION IN OUR COMMUNITY- I WOULD SAY THAT OVERALL WE DO SEE THAT THE CRIME RATES ARE CONTINUING TO DECREASE. BUT THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS ESPECIALLY- AS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED IF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ON HOW WE HAVE SEEN CERTAIN CRIMES SUCH AS THE CATEGORIES THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED- TAKE FLIGHT IN KUWAIT. AND SO- I DON'T THINK THAT THAT REALLY ALL CLOSE TO WHETHER OR NOT I POLICIES OVERALL ARE WORKING I REALLY THINK HE GOES TO THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO. AS WE'VE BEEN CUT NINETEEN. SO I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW. SAY THE THERE HAS BEEN A STUDY THAT SHOWN THE SINCE PROPERTIES PROPERTIES THAT HAS NOT- HAS AND- EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND YES I WOULD AGREE THAT. ON THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE IN VERY DESPERATE SITUATION SO WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SOME OF THESE. CRIMES IS- THE OTHER QUESTION I THINK- SEAN. THAT'S YOUR MONEY IF I IF I MAY HAVE BEEN TOO IS THAT I DO BELIEVE WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE M. FROM PROP FORTY SEVEN THAT WE HAVE SEEN PROPERTY CRIMES GO UP BUT WHAT I THINK IS THE REASON WHY IS WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM FOR IT I KNOW AT LEAST IN MY COUNTY THERE'S LIMITED CAPABILITIES OF DOING A DEFLECTION OR DIVERSION IN THESE CASES- AND THAT IS REALLY AT IT TIED THE HANDS OF VESTED TO CONNECT TO DIVERT. A YEAR AND I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE OU SEEN THE INCREASING CRIME HAS BEEN IDENTITY THEFT NOT FOR SURE HAS HAPPENED IN IN MOST CITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN NECESSARILY CORRELATION IS BETWEEN THOSE SPIKES BECAUSE A PROP FORTY SEVEN OR THE LACK OF POVERTY HAS INCREASED WITH THE INCREASE IN OUR COMMUNITY SIGNIFICANTLY SO HERE IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY 25% OF MY OF MY COMMUNITY LIVES AT OR BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL ON TOP OF THAT HUNDRED DOLLAR MEDICAL EMERGENCY SO 40% OF MY COMMUNITY IS STRUGGLING ECONOMICALLY AND I THINK THAT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN REALLY SEEING THE INCREASE IN POVERTY LEVEL OFFENSES AND THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THEFT RELATED- AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE SUBSTANCE USE MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I'M DEALING WITH ON LARGE SCALE IDENTITY THEFT CASES WHICH ARE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS- ARE ARE REALLY DRIVEN BY SUBSTANCE SUBSTANCE. SUBSTANCE UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH I HAVE FORTY BEDS IN RECOVERY I'M SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY SHORT ON THE ABILITY TO TAKE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ARE ARE USING THEFT AS A MECHANISM TO SUPPORT A HABIT OR MENTAL HEALTH OR POVERTY AND REALLY PLACE THEM IN A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN REALLY ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS SO WE HAVE WE HAVE SEEN IT- BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CORRELATION IS NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF FORTY SEVEN SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK ONE ONLY GONNA GET A MISDEMEANOR BUT YOU'RE STILL GOING TO GET A MISDEMEANOR IF THAT'S THE CASE. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS A TREMENDOUS SPIKE. IN POVERTY AND I BELIEVE WHEN KOBE WINDS DOWN. THE ECONOMIC FOR BE. YOU KNOW A BIG BIG FAN AS WELL SO. WE'LL SEE. MY NEXT QUESTION HAVE TO QUESTION THIS QUESTIONS AND ONE MORE QUESTION- IS TO JUDGE- ESPINOZA- IF I MAY YOU MAY READ AND IN THE COUNTY AND CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE HAVE EIGHTY. AT CRISIS LEVEL HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM- DRUG EPIDEMIC MATH UP ATOMIC BOMB AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AT OUR HANDS AND IT SEEMS LIKE THOSE ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED AS WELL. AND ARE. CITY I'M JUST GONNA READ WHAT YOU KNOW ARE SOME OF THE OFFICIALS- FROM BOTH LAPD AND EVEN MAYOR GARCETTI HAVE SPOKEN ON HIS. SENSE IT HAS BEEN REGULATED NOW DOWN TO A MISDEMEANOR THAT IS- POSSESSION ARE THERE IS MORE OF A REVOLVING DOOR WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE PEOPLE GO INTO TREATMENT FACILITIES LIKE WE HAD BEFORE SO IT HAD SOME EFFECT ON THE STREET LEVEL. AND THE MAYOR GARCETTI SAYS ALSO I AGREE WITH THEM IF SOMEBODY GETS ARRESTED THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SERVE ANY JAIL TIME IF THEY DO SERVE TIME IN JAIL THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PROSECUTED. IF THEY DON'T GET PROSECUTED IF THEY DO GET PROSECUTED THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SENTENCED AND IF THEIR SENTENCE THERE OUT RIGHT AWAY. IT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM. I'D LIKE TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE SYSTEM BEING BROKEN. AND HOW WE- NEED TO INTERVENE- TWO TWO TWO SOMETIMES DEMAND TREATMENT- BECAUSE IT IS ALSO INCREASING CRIME. SO MOST OF THE LITERATURE THAT I'VE READ SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT PORCH TREATMENT IT'S NOT A SMALL BOOKS NOT AS SUCCESSFUL AS VOLUNTARY CARE AND TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SEEMS TO BE THE FOCUS OF YOUR COMMENTS ON WHAT EXPERT IN THIS AREA. BUT I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE MASS INCARCERATION THAT RESULTED ON FELONY PROSECUTIONS FOR DRUG POSSESSION. ON WERE NOT HELPFUL. THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN STATE PRISON IN COUNTY JAIL AND EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE FORCED ON CARE PORSCHE TREATMENT. THAT HAS TO BE MATCHED WITH SOME RESOURCES TO PROVIDE CARE AND TREATMENT WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN THE CASE AND SO I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS FELONY PROSECUTIONS FOR SIMPLE POSSESSION. ON TO END HOMELESSNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ARREST I DON'T THE ANSWER IS SERVICE SERVICE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES WE ARE HARM REDUCTION- ORGANIZATION THATBELIEVES THAT YOU HAVE TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. GET THEM STABILIZED IN THE COMMUNITY AND BEGAN DEALING WITH HER ON THAT HE HAD REAL HEALTH NEEDS WHETHER IT'S MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS- I'M NOT SURE THAT IF THE MAYOR SAYING WE NEED FELONY PROSECUTIONS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN PROVIDING TREATMENT THAT I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT. WHAT HE SAID. IN THE STATEMENT. THANK YOU. AND LASTLY- TO THE DA- IN IN SOME WALKING. I THINK JUST- FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED AND- TRAFFICKING AND THOSE FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE. ON THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE MEETING UP WITH A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD- HAVE YOU SEEN AN INCREASE BECAUSE ANECDOTALLY AND MY COMMUNITY AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND VENTURA COUNTY. ACROSS THE STATE- I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A IN AND I'VE READ THERE IS A GROWING PROBLEM WITH CHILD HUMAN TRAFFICKING- IS THERE AN INCREASE IN IN IN YOUR COUNTY. I THINK THERE'S AN INCREASE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA I THINK IT WORLDWIDE- I THINK WE ARE DEFINITELY I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE MAYBE WE JUST DIDN'T SEE IT FOR WHAT IT WAS OFTEN THAT WE WERE PROSECUTING YOU KNOW YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN- IN IN THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY YOU NAME. AT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY YEARS OLD FOR WHAT WE CONSIDERED IN THAT DAY PROSTITUTION AND NOBODY EVER COME YOU'RE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD IN YOUR HERE HOW DID HOW DID WHAT WAS YOUR JOURNEY INSTEAD WE LOOKED AT IT AGAIN. AS DOING HARM AND NOT REDUCING THE HARM BY INCARCERATING EVERYBODY DOES NOTHING BECAUSE IN THIS SITUATION WE JUST TO COME IN FOR A COUPLE DAYS. OF MAYBE TEN TWENTY THIRTY DAYS DEPENDING ON THE JUDGMENT EVEN AT THE TIME AND THEN THEY WERE BACK OUT WITH NO SERVICES NO OPPORTUNITY TO BE LIFTED UP AND TO BE HILL. SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE LIKE YOUR SCENARIO BEFORE WITH THE PROP FORTY SEVEN CASES SO IF YOU EVEN IF YOU MOVED IT BACK TO A FELONY CONVICTION FOR SAY IT USED TO BE IN THE DAY THREE TO FIVE PRIOR PETTY THEFTS WOULD GET YOU A FELONY CONVICTION. AND EVEN THEN A JUDGE WOULD GIVE YOU LESS THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS ON AVERAGE WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO DO ALTERNATIVE WORK PROGRAM SO YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK IN FOR ANY PROGRAMMING YOU'RE JUST DOING MORE JAIL MORE FIT FEES OR FINES. AND YOU'RE STILL GOING TO COME OUT STILL HAVE MENTAL HEALTH STILL HAVE SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES AND STILL BE LIVING IN POVERTY PROBABLY MORE POVERTY BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DID. AND EVEN IF I ONLY BOOK YOU FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS SAVE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO DO IS DAY AND SOMETIMES WATCHING CORPORATION DOES WORK. BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT PEOPLE THAT ARE DRIVING FROM POVERTY AND YOU GIVEN FORTY EIGHT HOURS THAT'S STILL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARSOF THE TAXPAYERS DOLLARS FOR THE REST OF THE PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENSE AND THE COURT'S TIME. BY THE TIME WE GET THERE SO IT'S STILL A LOT OF MONEY AND RESOURCES AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE RELEASED AND THERE'S NO MORE ADDITIONAL TIME AND NO PROGRAMMING WE REALLY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING EXCEPT SPENT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY. AND THEN CIRCLING BACK TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING YES ABSOLUTELY AND WERE VERY AGGRESSIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY WE'RE CONSTANTLY WORKING EVERY. TOOL AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. THERE IS NOW A LOT OF MONEY. OF FUNDING AND MECHANO. SPAM FOR THE- WHICH IS VERY LABOR INTENSIVE. BUT ALSO THERE NEEDS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE HEALING- RIGHT NOW I'M WORKING WITH AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD. IN THE EVENING I VOLUNTEER AND I GO OUT TO THE HOMELESS CAMPS. AND I WORK SPECIALLY SINCE COVERT HAD STARTED. I HAVE AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TRANSGENDER. YOUNG FEMALE WHO COMES IN FOR A DAY OR TWO THEN GOES BACK OUT FOR A WEEK OR TWO. COMES IN FOR A DAY GOES BACK OUT. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY FACILITY. THAT CAN REALLY ADDRESS THE LONG TERM TRAUMA. SHE WAS TRAFFIC IT'S SINCE THE AGE OF TWELVE HER GRANDMOTHER TURNED AROUND IN EXCHANGE TO PAY OFF HER DEBTS FOR THE DRUG LORDS THAT WERE SELLING MONEY TO WORK. ARE SELLING DRUGS TO HER. SHE'S BEEN AND PROFITS FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS HAS SUFFERED TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES A NUMBER OF THINGS HAVE GONE ON. WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE AND STABILIZER. A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN I WAS OUT ON THE STREET I BROUGHT OUR FOOD IN THE HOPES OF TRYING TO GET HER TO COME BACK IN- HER. TRAFFICKER SAAMI. HE TOOK HER PHONE. AND HE TEXT LITERALLY DEATH THREATS. TO ME YES BECAUSE I KNOW WHO YOU ARE I WON'T EVEN TELL YOU THE LANGUAGE IT WAS HORRIFIC. AND HE SAID YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA TAKE MY MONEY MAKER. I'LL KILL YOU I'LL KILL HER TOO. THERE WAS NO IF ANDS OR BUTS. IT IS A VERY VIOLENT WORLD. AND IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS WORLD AND IF WE NEED TO HAVE. TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT JUST GO GET SOMEBODY OFF THE STREET AND EXPECT IT TO BE PERFECT. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRAVEL- I TO ADVOCATES THAT ARE HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS SURVIVORS. IT TOOK ONE TEN YEARS. AND THE OTHER TWO YEARS BEFORE WE CAN FINALLY MOVE THEM. OUT OF THE LIFESTYLE IF YOU WILL. IN INTO SAFETY. SO I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND ESPECIALLY WE'RE SEEING SUCH AN INCREASE WITH THE INTERNET. OBVIOUSLY AND- READILY AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. BUT WE'RE SEEING IT ON THE STREET IN THE- YOU KNOW IN THE OLD DAYS ON THE BLADE RIGHT NOW. ANYBODY THAT LOOKS UNDER EIGHTEEN IS GOING FOR TWO TO THREE TIMES THE MARKET VALUE- THERE'S A YEAH I MEAN I COULD TELL YOU HORRIFIC STORIES BUT I DON'T WANT TO TRAUMATIZE. EVERYBODY'S MONEY BUT IT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE. IT'S AN X. ISSU. AS WE AND I. MEAN TO. AND I ON IT. BUT THE HEALING. OF THE TRAFFIC VICTIMS IF YOU YEARS AND YEARS IN THE MAKING. AND THAT AND IT'S VERY COMPLEX. AND SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY SUPPORT. ON BOTH SIDES WE NEED MORE INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS BECAUSE MOST OF THIS IS HAPPENING ONLINE- AND THOUGH I STILL HAVE A HIGH POPULATION ON THE STREET. LIKE I SAID. AND THEN THE OTHER PART IS THE HEALING VERY CRITICAL FOR US TO THANK YOU FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THIS. IT IS CRITICAL. THANK YOU. MISTER DANCER I THANK YOU AND THANK EVERYONE FOR THESE QUESTIONS- FOR ME- BECAUSE I'VE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR QUITE AWHILE- AND I'M KIND OF. TIRED OF ANECDOTAL. SUGGESTIONS OF WHAT'S GOING ON I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE MAKING CLAIMS AND IT IS WE'RE NOT A POINT WHERE WE NOT HAVE TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY IN FACT WE PROBABLY NEED A THIRD PARTY GROUP. TO KIND OF LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. AND DOCUMENTED BUT ALSO COME UP WITH- WITH THE SPECIFIC- DATA THAT SHOWS WHETHER IT'S LOCKED THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY AND KEEP HIM IN CARCERI LONGER OR WE DO THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES BUT WE NEED TO GO OUT TO THESE COMMUNITY GROUPS. AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE PROGRAMS ACTUALLY WORK AND IF AND IF THEY DO THEN WE NEED TO GIVE MORE MONEY TO THE PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND DIVERT MONEY SOME ONES THAT DON'T. CONVERSELY IF THERE SOME PRISON PROGRAMS TO JAIL PROGRAMS THAT WORK WE NEED TO FUND THOSE TWO IF THERE'S ANOTHER MIDWAY- WE CAN HANDLE ALL THESE PROBLEMS- THAT HAVE THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. THEM WE NEED TO COLLABORATE TOGETHER THE REASON I SAY A THIRD PARTY GROUP WHICH I AM I MAY EVEN RECOMMEND TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT WILL DO THE DATA COLLECTION AND ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT PROGRAMS THAT WORK MORE DON'T WORK. IS THAT WE WE'VE GOT TO STOP FIGHTING OVER THE MONTH AND WE NEED TO DIRECT THE MONEY TO WEAR. THINGS ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. I'M FROM FIRM BELIEVER THAT MAYBE ONE PERSON. NEEDED TO BE DETAINED AND- BROUGHT INTO A DRUG PROGRAM AND THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT BE NEED TO BE VOLUNTARILY SUBMIT THEMSELVES BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE AS AS THE PROP 47-57 POKER TALKING ABOUT. WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE CORE ISSUE. WE CAN'T JUST PUT BANDAIDS ON THINGS AND BANDAIDS OR THINGS WE REALLY GOT TO GET TO THE CORE ISSUES AND THAT'S REALLY REALLY HARD WORK AND- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT- PEOPLE DELIGHT BOGUS AND TO. TURN OVER OVERNIGHT AND SO I IF THERE'S A WAY. THAT BOTH SIDES CAN COME TO US AND GET MAYBE EVEN TALK TO A THIRD PARTY- MADAM CHAIRED A THIRD PARTY GROUP THAT COULD COME UP WITH SOME. WAYS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM A LOT BETTER AND I INVITE INPUT FROM YOU OPTION ONE. BY M. COULD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEN NOW YOU JUST ADVOCATES BUT JUST COMMUNITY FOLKS TO SAY OR EVEN PEOPLE WHO WERE IN A LIFE OR OR COMMITTING THE CRIME TO SAY WHAT. COULD WE HAVE DONE. TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY OF THESE ADVERSE- INDUSTRIES OR OR OR CRIMES BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY- WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE CORE ISSUES IN THE ESTES PARK YES IT'S ON. THE ENVIRONMENT YOU GREW UP IN YES W. SAYS YES IS THE MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT OF IT WHICH A LOT OF US DON'T EVEN WANT TO DEAL WITH WE JUST KIND OF GLOSS OVER. BUT THAT MAY BE THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF THIS OF THIS WHOLE CRIMINALITY. IS THAT- OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH AT A YOUNG AGE. YOU KOW YOU YOU YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A LIFE. AS IF THEY JUST DECIDED TO BE IN IT BUT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT AT TEN OR ELEVEN BY A BY A SPOT BY A PARENT. BY ONGOING NOT. AND THEN YOU WONDER WHY THEY'RE ON THE STREET AT EIGHTEEN A MAYBE BECAUSE- ALL OF THAT STUFF THAT HAPPENED THAT THEY WON'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT. AND IT WE ALSO NEED TO QUANTIFY IT NOW LEAVE YOU WITH THIS QUANTITY IF WE QUANTIFY IT. ESPECIALLY THE COST. WHICH IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE REALLY IT'S EASY TO SAY. X. AMOUNT OF ROBBERIES X. AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ARE HUMAN TRAFFICKING X. AMOUNT OF MURDERS AND THAT COST X. AMOUNT OF COST AVOIDANCE. IS REALLY DIFFICULT. TO QUANTIFY IF I TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM. X. AMOUNT OF PEOPLE DID NOT RECEIVE THE BAIT THEN WE SHOULD SAY WE HAD X. AMOUNT OF SAVINGS. BUT HOW MANY OF THEM DID NOT COMMIT A MURDER HOW MANY OF THEM DID NOT BREAK INTO SOMEONE'S HIGH MANY OF THEM. THAT STUFF THAT'S REALLY THE HARD PART TO TRY TO GET TO THAT AND WE REALLY SHOULD. BECAUSE COST AVOIDANCE IS HUGE AND WHAT PEOPLE DO WITH PROP IS. IS WILL DWARF. BUT I NEED DATA. I NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAVE- TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE WE'RE DOING ALL THESE PROGRAMS- LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO DO AS MUCH AND THEN THEY CAN CONCENTRATE. ON MAY BE GOING TO THE REALLY SERIOUS ONE SO. IF YOU. IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH ME I WOULD REALLY GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A- AN INDEPENDENT SOURCE TO DO THE KIND OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES SO THAT WE BRING BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE. THESE ARE THE NUMBERS THESE ARE THE ACTUAL NUMBERS AND- AND WE WERE NOT TAKEN KINDA ANECDOTAL ANALYSIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S I MEAN WE'VE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH BACK FORCES I GOT HERE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE'RE STILL DOING THE SAME THING BUT WE GOT TO BRING IN MORE DATA. SO THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS- A LOT OF THESE POLICIES- ARE YOUNG I'VE BEEN HERE FOR NINE YEARS A LOT OF THESE POLICIES HAVE BEEN WORKED ON SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE- IT TAKES TIME- INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GOING TO OVERCOME TRAUMAS THAT AND- THE AND THE FIRST STEP OFTENTIMES AND SO. THAT DATA IS IMPORTANT- BOOK. IN THEM IN THE END- I THINK WE NEED TO RELY ON BUT THE COMMUNITY THE EXPERTS ARE TALKING TO US ABOUT THE WORKING WITH COMPASSION. OFF WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES OUT THERE. ASTERION COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS THE FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER- HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I WOULD OFTEN HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF THAT THESE WERE KIDS- AND WHEN THEY MADE A MISTAKE THAT THE SERVE SECOND CHANCES AND OFTEN SCIENCES I HAD A DISCUSSION WITH THEM IT WAS. THE SITUATION THAT LEAD THEM DOWN A PATH WITH THAT THEY WERE NOT IS REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT THE FATHER HAD OTHER CHOICES OUT THERE ON AND SO I JUST DO THINK THAT- WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO. TO FIGURE THIS OUT NOT JUST BECAUSE I BUDGET I NEED TO SEE WHAT THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS EVER TALKING ABOUT OF ANY TO THAT NEED A SENSE OF WHAT THAT I'M GOING TO BE MINDFUL OF TIME WE DO HAVE A HARD STOP OF TWELVE THIRTY- AND SO I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR BEING HERE AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP.
