TEST ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES THERE IS NO EXISTING REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLICANTS FOR A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE RECEIVED ANY INSTRUCTIONAL TRAINING.

WHEN THE BALCONY THERE STUNNED MONK COLLAPSED? MANY OF YOU HERE OF CHILDREN. AND MANY DO YOU EVER THINK TO TELL YOUR KIDS DON'T STEP OUT ON THE BALCONY. BECAUSE NOT MILLION YEARS I NEVER TALK TO MY DAUGHTER NOT TO WALK OUT ON THE BALCONY. AND THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A COULD COLLAPSE. BECAUSE WE FAILED THESE KIDS THREE YEARS AGO BY LETTING THIS HAPPEN. THE MANY MILESTONES INNER KIDS LIFES I'M SURE YOU ALL HAVE THEM -- I DON'T HEARING MONDAY. HURT TWENTY FIRST WILL BE THIS WEEKEND BUT A COUSIN GAVIN. LIBYA'S BROTHERS WILL BE NEXT WEEKEND THEN NOW BOTH ARE ONLY REMAINING KIDS WHAT THE LIFT THAT'S OUR LIFE WITH OTHE SIBLINGS. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN UNDER YOUR COLLEGE AGE KIDS ON THE BALCONY THAT NICE SO THINK ABOUT IT WAS YOUR KIDS. THE PARENTS OF THE FIVE VICTIMS WERE KILLED WE NEVER GET TO SEE THEIR KIDS AGAIN YARIS PARENTS ATTEND FEAST SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO DO YOU S. FOR J. ONE SUMMER EXPERIENCE. I CALIFORNIA SEND FIVE COFFINS BACK HOME. THAT THE KIDS HOME IN THE COFFIN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE YOU SEND YOUR KIDS AWAY TO IRELAND AND THEY WERE SENT BACK IN THE COFFIN. THE SEVEN HUNDRED INJURED KIDS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME HOUSES OF LIFE'S BEING CHANGED. SO REALLY THIS BILL REQUIRED BALCONIES BE INSPECTED UNDER SAFE AND UP TO COAT. HER SEE FOR ME I'D LIKE TO SEE ALL BUCK MUST BE INSPECTED NOT JUST DEPARTMENTS WANTED. BUT I WANT THINK IT WAS A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY. HOW MANY MORE BALCONIES ARE READY TO FALL DOWN? LOOK AT THE NUMBERS FROM BERKELEY LITTLE BERKELEY WHEN THEY ACTIONS BACK TO TWO THOUSAND BALCONIES UP TO BERKELEY COLLAPSE I'M NEARLY ONE IN FIVE ISSUES. THIS DATA SHOULD CONCERN YOU -- THAT REALLY REALLY CONCERNS ME THE WAY THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T WANT -- TO WANT REFORM. HERE ARE THE SIX PHOTOGRAPHS OF THESE KIDS IN FRONT TO YOU. THIS IS ALL THE PARENTS HAD LEFT THERE'S NO MORE MILESTONES FOR US. NO COLLEGE GRADUATIONS NO WEDDINGS NO BABY SHOWERS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ALL HAD BIG FUNERALS. MY HUSBAND GEORGE NEVER GOT TO WALKER DAUGHTER THE ODD BUT HE DID CARRY A COFFIN AT THE AYE AND A BELOVED COUSIN ALLEVIATE FOLLOW TURN HER COFFIN NOT IS A BRIGHT NIGHT SHE BECAME BEHIND HER COFFIN. SO I'M SPEAKING OUT TODAY IN HONOR. OF THOSE WHO NO LONGER HAVE A VOICE AND IF YOU BURKE FOREVER.

AND THE THIRD THE BIG ONE COMMON YET CALIFORNIA BUILD CANTILEVER BALCONIES FIFTY FEET UP ABOVE GROUND LEVEL MAKE SOMEONE. WRAPPED IN STOCKHOLM WITH NO TIES BACK TO THE BUILDING. THEY NEVER HAVE TO INSPECT OUR INSPECT THEM AND THEY THINK THEY CAN LAST A LIFETIME. SO EVERY TIME YOU WALK UP IN THE BALCONY THINK ABOUT THESE KIDS THAT NICE. AT THIS FUNKY BEEN INSPECTED BY A LICENSED CONTRACTOR A KIDS COULD BE ALIVE TODAY GUYS. SO HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU TAKE A STEP ON THE BALCONY WILL BE OUR LAST ACT. AND IN YOUR SUPPORT YOU'LL SEE BLACKROCK THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND WASTE ARE THE PROPERTY MANAGERS THE TIME -- HAD LETTERS OF SUPPORT THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING CHANGES.

THE DONAHOE'S IN THE BIRTH FAMILY AND GET YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY CHEN THAT'S THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. SEE NONE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING MARK OLSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS OF THE SEVEN THREE VERSION WE KNOW THIS BILL HAS NO FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE. AYE WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THANK YOU. LIVE IN MOTION BY MISTER QUIRK A SECOND BY MR PEROT AND MR WOULD YOU LIKE. TO RESPECTFULLY AFTER I GOT MARRIED THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THAT GETS OUT ON A ROLL CALL WITH MR OBERNOLTE VOTING NOW. AT THIS POINT SINCE YOU'VE WITNESSED UP HERE ANYWAY IF YOU WOULD LIKE. TO MOVE. TO DID YOU SAY SBFOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE WILL TAKE THAT TESTIMONY NOW. IS A SUSPENSE CANDIDATE GOING TO LET AND HEAD MISTER HILL JUST INTRODUCED THE BILL AND THEN. AND THEN BY ALL MEANS. MOHAWK IT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD TO STUDY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM RECEIVING CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS SETTLEMENTS FROM THEIR LICENSEES. THIS BILL IMPLEMENTS THIS A CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD RECOMMENDATION BY REQUIRING CONTRACTORS TO REPORT CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS SETTLEMENTS OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS INVOLVING RENTAL MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS TO TO THE C. SLP. THE COMPANY THEY CONSTRUCTED THE BALCONY BECAUSE APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH ABOUT THE COLLAPSED. IN BERKELEY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SAKE WE CONSTRUCTION HAD PAID TWENTY SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWSUIT. SETTLEMENTS IN THE THREE YEARS BEFORE THE COLLAPSED. IN THIS YEAR'S SHELBY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF DEFECTIVE WORK BECAUSE CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE CONTRACTORS TO REPORT SUCH SETTLEMENTS. AT THE TIME THE INTO THE CSW XIN FORCE WHEN SHE SAID THAT HAD THE BOARD KNOWN WE WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY TAKEN ACTION SUCH KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE TRIGGERED AN INVESTIGATION. WITH THIS BILL THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE I RESPECTFULLY ASK AND I'VE OF VENDORS AND I DO HAVE A WITNESS. OKAY AND I WILL MAKE THIS FAST SO YOU I DON'T GIVE IT A BACKGROUND JUST A COUPLE THINGS -- SESSION -- THE BUILDINGS HE SPENT ABOUT THREE MILLION LOBBY IN A MEASURES INCLUDE SP FOUR SIXTY FIVE SO WAS CENTER WAS TAKEN OUT THE REPORT PARKS AND FOR STUDY THE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD. GREAT PEOPLE CONDUCT LIKE ABOARD I TRY TO WORK WITH AND HELP THEM OUT. AND GIVE ME AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE THAT I COULD COME UP WHICH IT WASN'T FOR STUDY TO SEE IF THE ABILITY OF THE BOARD TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC WOULD BE ENHANCE. BY REGULATIONS REQUIRING LICENSEES TO REPORT JUDGMENTS ARBITRATION AWARDS ARE SEGMENT PAYMENTS OF THOSE CLAIMS STUDY. SO THAT'S HOW I CAME BACK HERE HOW DO PEOPLE LIVING ABOUT ME SAID NO THEIR SEX ALL YOUR BALCONIES. BECAUSE IF THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN KNOWN THAT THESE BALCONIES WERE BUILT BY SEGWAY. AND THAT'S LIKELY BEEN REPEATED THE SUIT TO HONESTLY THINK THEY WOULD WALK DOWN THE HALL CAN THAT NIGHT. WOULD YOU WALK OUT BALCONY VENUE THAT COMPANY WAS SUED FOR TWENTY SIX MILLION. YOU PROBABLY UNDER THE SAME KIND OF WATER INTRUSION YOU WOULDN'T DO US -- THE OTHER THING IS AS JERRY HAD MENTIONED S. B. FORM FOR SIXTY FIVE IS MUCH NARROWER THAN SELF REPORTING AND ENSURE REPORTING LAWS THAT AND THE OTHER LICENSEE TRADE AND PROFESSIONAL. THROUGH IMPORTANT IS ONE MILLION THAT'S ALL IT IS AND APPLIES ONLY TO MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES THE HOTELS COLLEGES SINGLE FOUND HOMES ARE NOT INCLUDED -- BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT WIRE ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS A QUADRUPLE JUDGMENT SETTLEMENTS IN ARBITRATION AWARD BUT NOT THE LICENSES CONTRACTORS WHO BUILD WHAT THE ENGINEERS IN DESIGN. AND THE ARCHITECTS DESIGN. SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. MY UNDERSTANDING AFTER A LOT OF RESEARCH FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. IS THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC IS REQUIRED TO BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE CONTRACTORS LICENSING BOARD AND EXERCISING ITS LICENSING. REGULATORY AND DISPARITY FUNCTION. HOW CAN THE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD DO THEIR JOB AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS? THEY CURRENTLY RECEIVE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND CONSUMER COMPLAINTS PER YEAR MOSTLY SINGLE FAMILY RELATED BUT THEY DON'T GET MUCH A MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS SINCE THEY SETTLE. THEIR PICK OF THE INSURANCE TAKE THE PAYMENTS TO THE CONTRACTORS BOARD NEVER FIND OUT ABOUT THIS. SO AS A MOTHER. IS THE CONTRACTORSLICENSE BOARD IN CALIFORNIA ONLY FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES SO IF YOU BUILD A FENCE AND IT'S OFF A BIT OUT. ARE YOU CAN BE TOLD TO KNOCK DOWN ARE DO WHATEVER TUITION PAYER FINDS BUT THE BIG BOYS THE LIKE A SEGWAY IN ALL. OH NO THEIR INSURANCE PAID THE TWENTY SIX MEDINA NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT THE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN BERKELEY. THE REASON THE INDUSTRY DOES NOT WANT THESE REFORMS TO GO TRUE SOME. IF THEY CAN DO SECRET SETTLEMENTS AND HEIGHT. THEY'RE NEGLIGENT CONSTRUCTION WHEN THE COPS GET CALL IT REALLY SADDENS ME WHEN GROUPS OPPOSED THESE BILLS THAT CAN PREVENT MAJOR INDUSTRY OUR DEBT. FOR ME AFTER LOOKING AT SO MUCH DATA I THINK THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SHOULD WANT TO REPRESENT A SAFE INDUSTRY. AND STOP HIDING BEHIND BADCOCK CONNECTORS AND THAT THE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD -- GET RID OF BAD ACTORS BY AROUND SENTIMENTS FROM INSURANCE OUR CONTRACTORS TO BE FORWARD TO THE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD SO WE CAN PROTECT THE PUBLIC. BY DOING A CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF THE CONTRACTOR IS COMPLYING WITH BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS. IF THIS WAS YOUR CHILD ARE MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL? LIKE IT ANYMORE BALCONIES ARE GOING TO FALL DOWN. SO REALLY FOR THESE KIDS HERE I URGE YOU. TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS WHY IS THE COUNTRY'S THOSE MORE TO BUSINESS IS A JUST PRINT THING THE FAMILY HOMES AND THE SMALL PEOPLE. CONTRACTORS BUT ALL THE BIG BOYS GET OFF BECAUSE INSURANCE DON'T HAVE TO REPORTERS BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN REPORTED. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT SAID WAIT. IF SOMEONE ELSE ADDED ON THE RIGHT PAYING. OUR KIDS COULD BE ALIVE TODAY GUYS. I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR KIDS YOU'LL WALK OUT HERE AND OF THE OVER FOR ME. I LIVED HELD THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND THAT'S WHY GUYS I'M GOING NO WHERE I'M GOING TO KEEP COMING UP HERE UNTIL EVERYONE DOES WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS HERE CAN YEAH. THANK YOU [inaudible] COMPLETE.

I WILL END WITH THAT THEM AT OF CHAIR AND ALLOW ME WITNESSES TO MAKE SOME BRIEF STATEMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU KNOW AND NOT WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH. GOOD MORNING TOTAL FOUR MINUTES AND SPORT. THINK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S AUDRY OF SIGUR. TURNING IN THE VENTURA COUNTY JUST TRAINS OFFICE I RUN THE SEX CRIMES DIVISION ONE SUPERVISOR OF THAT DIVISION OF TWENTY LAWYERS. I AM A U. S. C. LOCK GRADUATE. IN MY FIRST YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL I SAW DOCTOR TYNDALL. BUT HE SEXUALLY ABUSED ME. AS A WOMAN UNDERGOING A GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM WHY WOULDN'T I TRUST MY DOCTOR. I WAS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE. WHICH DOCTOR JINGLE NEW I TRUSTED HIM. AND HE USED HIS POSITION OF POWER TO ORDER THE NURSE OUT OF THE ROOM. AND SEXUALLY ABUSED ME. DECADES LATER I FIND OUT THAT I WAS NOT ALONE. THE DOCTOR TYNDALE WAS SEXUALLY ABUSING WOMAN FOR MANY YEARS HE IS A PROLIFIC PREDATOR. PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC SEXUAL PREDATORS IN OUR GENERATION. THE INSTITUTIONS WERE CHARGED WITH PROTECTING US FAILED. THE TRUST PATIENTS PUT IN THEIR DOCTORS PROPERLY [inaudible] FAILED. AND IT CREATED A SAFE HARBOR FOR HIM TO CONTINUE HIS ABUSE. THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THE PATIENTS ARE PROPERLY PROTECTED AND ALSO THAT. GOOD DOCTORS. YOU DON'T OF THESE PATIENTS ARCHITECT. REMOVING THE REAL SECRECY WILL HELP ALL OF US. AND I THINK IT WILL HELP DISCOURAGE PREDATORS FROM FINDING A MEDICAL DEGREE AND HIDING BEHIND A WHITE COATS THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERS. THE COST INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. OF NOT TELLING PATIENTS THAT SOMEONE'S BEEN CONVICTED OR FOUND TO BE A PREDATOR BY THEIR ASSOCIATION. IS HIGH. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT ALREADY PAID TO INVESTIGATE DOCTOR TYNDALL I KNOW THEY'RE FLYING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. INTERVIEW A WOMAN LIKE ME. AND THE LA DA HAS ALSO GONE HAVE EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH COST AS THEY INVESTIGATE THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW HERE SEXUAL ABUSE SURVIVORS. UNDERGO YEARS AND YEARS OF NEEDS. SO I INVITE YOU TO JOIN ME TO LIFT THE VEIL PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY FROM SEXUAL OFFENDERS TO HIDE BEHIND A WHITE CAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT SUPPORTER. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS GINA AND TIME A FORMER JIM THIS A TWO TIME WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS YOU MEMBER. A THREE TIME NC DOUBLE A NATIONAL CHAMPION AND A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY MY DOCTOR. THE DOCTOR THAT ABUSE ME WAS A CHILD AS A CHILD WAS PROTECTED BY MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE. BECAUSE THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE IGNORED THE WARNING SIGNS AND REPORTS OVER THREE HUNDRED WOMEN AND GIRLS HAD MUST JUST STRENGTH TO STAND UP TO STOP IT. IT SHOULD NEVER COME TO THAT WE AS A SOCIETY SHOULD DO BETTER. THIS IS WHY MEANS FULL SUPPORT OF SB ONE FOUR FOUR EIGHT TRANSPARENCY IS VITAL. WHEN SECRECY IS ALLOWED AROUND MISCONDUCT OF ANY KIND IS THEN WHEN PERPETRATORS GAIN THE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ACTIONS AND CONTINUE TO ABUSE? HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS SO MANY ISSUES WITH THIS BILL. ONE IS DOING THE RIGHT THING EVER BEEN WRONG. I FEEL LIKE IF THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE MEDICAL AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THEN THEY WILL STOP FIGHTING AGAINST THIS BILL. LET'S PUT PEOPLE SAFETY FIRST AND NOT THE REPUTATION OF POTENTIAL PREDATORS IF THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH. NO THAT THE PASSING OF THIS BILL WILL SAVE THE STATE MONEY AND TIME TO PROSECUTE ANYMORE. WRONGDOING THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OR ON PAROLE -- THE INTEGRATED SERVICES FOR MENTALLY ILL PAROLEES PROGRAMS. WE ESTABLISHED THAT AND TWENTY EIGHT ó SEVEN TWENTY AWAY. AND IT HAS ONGOING FUNDING OF THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IT'S IN THE BUDGET. AND OF WHICH TEN POINT FIVE MILLION IS SPENT ON MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES. NOW SINCE THAT TIME -- THE MEDICO EXPANSION PROGRAM WAS APPROVED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH ALLOWED SINGLE CHILDLESS ADULTS TO RECEIVE MEDICAL. THE CALIFORNIA SIGNED UP LITERALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. ADDITIONALLY IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM [inaudible] INCLUDING -- PEOPLE THAT WERE ELIGIBLE -- SUCH AS THESE PAROLEES. SO NOW -- SINCE THAT TIME THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BUT THIS PROGRAM STILL FUNDS -- THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF THESE PAROLEES. WITH A 100% GENERAL FUND. AND DOES NOT USE MEDI CAL AT ALL TO FUND -- THESE PROGRAMS ASSEMBLY THIS BILL WITH THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES IS A SIMPLE THING [inaudible] SIMPLY ALLOWS. THE THE THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN. THE MEDI CAL. A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS THAT THE COUNTY OR SOME KIND OF COUNTY OR OF A PROVIDER. THAT'S WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES. YOU PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE. AND USE META CAL [inaudible] RATHER THAN. A 100% GENERAL FUND. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS A SIMPLICITY THING NOW IT SAVES. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF THE STATE JOURNAL FUND. SO -- URGING A VOTE ON THIS AND AT THE PROPER TIME [inaudible] WHEN -- YOU'RE LIFTING IT FROM SUSPENSE I'D LIKE CONSIDERATION THAT.

THANK YOU SPEAKER SINCE PART GOOD MORNING I AM MARRIED THERE WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE SENATOR BALLOT THINK MADE ALL THE FINANCIAL POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S A GENERAL FUND.

FAILING TO SERVE THESE GROW LEASE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SO WE URGE REMOVAL FROM THE SUSPENSE FILE NEXT WEEK THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SIMPLY PUT S. B. TEN TEN THAT WOULD A SHIFT DOLLARS TO MAKE THE PROGRAM THAT IT FUNDS MORE AFFECTED. BY INVESTING IN EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS THE UCLA STUDY OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM FOUND THAT THAT PROGRAM WAS INEFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF REDUCING RECIDIVISM -- AND AS SENATOR FELL AND MS ADAIR POINTED OUT IT ALSO IS VERY COSTLY TO THE STATE. AYE IF THE LEGISLATURE'S SHIFTED IS MEANT RESOURCES. TOWARD COUNTY BASED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR MEDI CAL THE STATE WOULD SAVE OVER SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND RECEIVING FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR MEDI CAL. IN DOING SO REDUCE THE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT COSTS FOR PAROLE THE PARTICIPANTS BY OVER TWO THIRDS -- MULTIPLE STUDIES SHOW THAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD MAKE AND BOTH MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND HOUSING ARE EVIDENCE BASED. AND HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM -- SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS PROGRAM THIS BILL IS REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM MORE EFFECTIVE WHILE ALSO SAVING THE STATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND MAR PAROLEES PROCESS.

AND THE COUNTIES INTERESTED BECAUSE IF THE PEOPLE GO TO COUNTY -- IN THERE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. IT'S A 100% COUNTY GENERAL FUND.

I THINK THE FISCAL ISSUES I THINK I'VE BEEN SPOKEN TO BY NESTLE ON OUR CONCERNS ARE LARGELY POLICY MATTERS I DO BELIEVE THAT ACTUALLY THE PROPONENTS. AND THE OPPONENTS ARE NOT REALLY WE AGREE THAT WE SHOULD JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND A MODEL THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. WHO WOULD THE ISSUES COME UP IS WE DON'T WANT A THE U. S. EMPLOYERS TO BE PUT IN A POSITION? OF HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PRODUCTION. MANUFACTURING OF HIGHLY DESIRABLE PRODUCTS THAT ARE EXPORTED [inaudible] ON BY PRODUCING THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES OR PRODUCING THOSE IN CHINA WE'VE HAD ENOUGH JOBS OFFSHORE. TO CHINA SECONDLY -- TO THE EXTENT THE BILL CONTINUES TO ALLOW A PRODUCT. WHICH OF EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY NOR NOT OF ITS SUPPLIERS ANIMAL TEST. IT THE BILL ALLOWS ANY THIRD PARTY IN THE WORLD WHO TESTS ANY COMPONENT PRODUCT. THAT WOULD SUDDENLY MAKE THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT SUBJECT TO RECALL URINE WOULD NO ACTION ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY AND OUT OF THE COMPANIES CONTROL. A WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE FIXED IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS BUT IF THAT THAT IS WHAT WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO THE FISCAL IMPACT OF PRODUCTS BEING WITHDRAWN FROM CALIFORNIA NOT BEING SOLD HAVING TO BE DESTROYED AND AND SO FORTH IN THAT COULD EFFECT THE JOBS OF ARMY. SO WE ABOUT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. MAUREEN HAGENS REPRESENTING VIACOM ALSO IN OPPOSITION.

HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE COURTS WANTED WE RECEIVE FUNDING ON A CASELOAD BASIS THEREFORE UNLESS THIS PARTICULAR CASE WILL BECOME SIGNIFICANT IN CAN BE DOCUMENT AND IT'S LIKELY TO BE THE SORT. THANK YOU AYE I DO WANT TO KNOW -- THERE WAS SOME DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THIS BILL. IT WAS KEEP FISCAL AT SOME POINT WAS NOT KEEP FISCAL -- IN WE DID TAKE THAT CONSIDERATION AND IT IN REQUESTING A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I WILL BE VOTING YES TODAY. I'M I'M I KNOW THE NUMBER OF OUR MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WERE GONNA -- ALLOW THEM TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT I HAVE SOME IS WEALTHY AND MISS CRAMP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR UP SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO THE ATTENTION OF THIS BODY AS A PET OWNER AS A CONSUMER OF COSMETICS -- IT HURTS MY HEART TO SEE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ANIMALS BEAN -- TESTED FOR PRODUCTS THAT WE USE -- I DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND A BIT MORE THE FISCAL IMPACT ON JOBS IN MANUFACTURING FOR OUR STATE I JUST CAME BACK FROM A DELEGATION TRIP TO CHINA. AND COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COUNTRY HAS INCREDIBLY LOW ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AS WELL AS STANDARDS FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF HOW WE COME TO AN AGREEMENT AND HOW -- WHERE ABLE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD GIVEN THE INCREDIBLE OPPOSITION AND THE IMPACT OF JOBS IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY I WILL BE VOTING? YES ON THIS BILL TODAY BUT I HOPE THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION MOVING FORWARD AND% THAT LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THAT MORE. WE HAVE ALLOWED ON FOREIGN EXEMPTION FOR FOREIGN COUNTRY UNTIL THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE I KNOW THEY'RE STILL CONCERN OVER THAT DATE. ON THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION [inaudible] DOCTOR QUIRK. YES WELL I SEE A BIG FISCAL IMPACT AS WRITTEN DOWN SO BE VOTING NOW. IF YOU GO TO THE E. U. MARVEL. WHERE YOU DON'T PENALIZE COMPANIES FOR TESTING THAT OCCURRED OVERSEAS? I BELIEVE I CAN TO SUPPORT THIS BUT AGAIN PLEASE GO TO THE U. MODEL I'LL BE VOTING NO TODAY ON FISCAL CRAMPS THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN. THERE'S ANYONE GOING TO BE AGAINST THE GOALS OF THIS BILL AND I'M GONNA VOTE TODAY I'M GONNA VOTE YESTERDAY AS WELL. BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU SOME OF MY CONCERNS I HOPE THAT YOU CAN WORK SOME OF THESE ISSUES OUT SOME OF THEM ARE JUST QUESTIONS AND SOME I THINK OUR WORDING ISSUES. I'M ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS -- WHAT HAPPENS TO AN INGREDIENT IF ANOTHER COMPANY OR ANOTHER ENTITY TESTS IT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT? THAT PARTICULAR MANUFACTURERS KNOWLEDGE OR WITHOUT THEIR PARTICIPATION DOES THAT MEAN THAT THAT INGREDIENT THEN BECOMES BAND IN THE STATE EVEN THOUGH [inaudible] IF COSMETIC COMPANY A DOZEN TESTS ON ANIMALS NEVER DID AND THAN COSMETIC COMPANIES SEE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY TEST THE SAME AGREE ON ANIMALS AS I MEAN. THAT THAT IS. ABANDONED IT IN OUR IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S A QUESTION THAT'S NOT IN THE BILL SO. I'D YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU INTEND THAT IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT DEALT WITH SOMEWHERE IN THE TEXT OF THE BILL SO THAT THERE'S CLARITY. SO THAT'S NUMBER. ONE IT'S TESTED OUTSIDE OF THE PARTICULAR MANUFACTURERS -- PURVIEW SECONDLY IN TERMS OF THE FAR EXEMPTION I COULD BE WRONG BUT WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD IS THAT THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS THAT IF YOU. AND WITH CHINA IS THAT A PRODUCT IS MANUFACTURED INSIDE OF CHINA I GUESS BECAUSE OF THEIR EXTREMELY HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TESTED ON ANIMALS BUT IF IT'S POSTED OUTSIDE OF CHINA IT DOES SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FOR MANUFACTURERS. THEIR ONLY CHOICE IS GOING TO BE TO MAKE DE THEIR NOT SO TO CHINA OR MANUFACTURE INSIDE OF CHINA. AND I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S A REAL ISSUE -- SO IF YOUR INTENTION IS AND I'M I LET YOU ANSWER THIS ONE IS YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT IT'S FINE IF ALL THE MAIN. CHINA BECAUSE THEN THERE'S NO ANIMAL TESTING. THAT IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE BILL THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT THE INTENTION AND AYE THE THERE ARE CONVERSATION STILL OCCURRING ABOUT WHAT THAT TIMELINE IS WITH THE TIMELINE DOESN'T MATTER AND HEALTH WHERE YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING WITH THAT BY FOR YEARS THEY HAVE. TO CHINA IF THEY'RE GONNA SELL TO CHINA BECAUSE A HALF THE PRODUCTS HAVE TO BE TESTED ON ANIMALS TO BE IMPORTED INTO CHINA. SO THE TIME I JUST MEANS THAT THEY HAVE ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS THEY CAN OPERATE HERE AND SO IMPORTANT CHINA AFTER THAT THEY HAVE TO MOVE OR NOT SELL YES I'M GONNA ALLOW MY SPONSOR TO TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT FIRST LET ME RESPOND TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION. WHICH WAS WITH REGARD TO ANOTHER COMPANY TAKING ANOTHER INGREDIENT I AND TESTING IT ON ANIMALS AND THAT FIRST COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW THAT THAT'S OCCURRED. WE DID TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT THAT SAY THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT LIABLE IF WAS TESTED BY SOME OTHER COMPANY. IF THAT NEEDS TO BE TIGHTENED UP WE CAN LOOK AT THAT YEAH THAT'S NO BIG SO EVEN IF THEY KNOW THOUGH WHETHER THEY KNOW OR NOT IS NOT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT RELEVANT IF ANOTHER IF THEY HAVE THAT AS AN INGREDIENT AND THEY KNOW THAT SOMEONE ELSE TESTS IT. THEN THEY STILL CAN'T USE IT EVEN IF IT'S TESTED AFTER THE MAIN THEY INTRODUCED IT ACCORDING TO YOUR BILL SO I'M JUST SAYING I THINK THAT SOMETHING SO FIVE BY HAVE MY PRODUCT AND I'VE INTRODUCED IT. AND THEN WHATEVER OF SOMETIMES SOME OTHER COMPANY TESTED ON ANIMALS THAT MEANS I HAVE TO PULL IT OFF THE SHELF RIGHT EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T HAVE TROLL OVER THAT. NO IT IS NOT WE TOOK AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THAT SPECIFICALLY AND IT'S NOT DETAILED IN THE APPROPRIATIONS ANALYSIS BUT WE DID. TAKE AMENDMENTS TO THAT EFFECT SORT LOT AND I'LL WELL THAT WE HAVE IN PRINT IT'S A DIFFERENCE NOT IT'S NOT REFLECT IS NOT IN THE ANALYSIS WELFARE SO I REALLY BILLS IN THE BILL KNOW THE BILL SAYS KNOWINGLY. SO KNOWINGLY OR NOT IS NOT THE THAT'S NOT THE ONLY CONCERN YOU MIGHT KNOW BUT YOU HAD NO CONTROL OVER GREAT. SO I I'M GONNA I'M GONNA TAKE OF THE CHINA PIECE AND THEN I'M GONNA LET OUR TOXICOLOGIST GO TO THOSE SECOND -- ONE SO. FIRST OF ALL WE ARE NOT PRO MOVING JOBS TO CHINA OKAY SO LET'S JUST. GET THAT OUT -- WHAT WE WERE TOLD IF IT IN THE BEGINNING OF DOING THIS BILL BY THE OPPOSITION WAS ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY? NO ONE CAN SELL THEIR PRODUCTS IN CHINA. WITHOUT TESTING ON ON PAIN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO TEST THEIR PRODUCT IN LESS. YOU HAD A MANUFACTURING PLANT IN CHINA [inaudible] OKAY. THEN TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE ON THE BILL. WE SPOKE TOO MANY MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE CRUELTY FREE AND THE ONE IN PARTICULAR IS JOHN PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS. THEY HAVE BEEN IN SANTA CLARITA FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS THEY MAKE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THEY'VE BEEN CRUELTY FREE SINCE INCEPTION. THEY WENT TO CHINA THEY WANNA BE AND THE CHINA AND THE CHINESE MARKET. AND THE CHINESE REGULATORS SAY. WE HAVE TO TOUCH OUR PRODUCTS ON ANIMALS AND THEY SAID NO. WORK CRUELTY FREE AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CRUELTY FREE. SO THEY WORKED WITH THE REGULATORS A FINE ATTEST. THAT WAS AMICABLE TO BOTH SIDES IT'S A SKIN TEST OUT OF BOSTON A COMPANY CALLED MATT TACK. UP AND THEY USE THAT. TO START PUTTING THEIR SKEWS THROUGH AND TESTING. SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT MODELS OF HOW YOU CAN BE IN CHINA TODAY FORGET ABOUT THIS BILL COMPLETELY. AND TEN DAYS BE IN CHINA WITHOUT TESTING ON ANIMALS THE OTHER WAY IS TO SET UP A STORE FRONT IN SHANGHAI. AND YOU'RE ALLOWED TO TO THEN. PUT YOUR PRODUCTS INTO THE CHINESE MARKET FROM THERE. A THIRD WAY WHICH IS I BELIEVE IT WAS A MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND I CAN SEND YOU THE LINKS FOR THESE ARTICLES -- IS THROUGH ALI BABA WHICH IS THE LARGEST ONLINE RETAILER IN THE WORLD. SO THERE IS NO REASON TO NOT BE IN CHINA. NUMBER ONE YOU CAN BE IN CHINA AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE CRUEL TO BE THERE. THE CHINESE ALL LET. CHRISTY SPEAK TO THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY PHASING OUT CERTAIN TESTS THAT WERE REQUIRED THAT. WERE ANIMAL TEST [inaudible] SO THAT'S SPEAKS TO THAT AND AS FAR AS JOBS AND I'M SORRY THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK MOVED AWAY. WE HAVE -- ARTICLES FROM REUTERS BLOOMBERG C. N. B. C. AND FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT AFTER THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT THE ALTERNATIVE TESTING MARKET AND THE SCIENCE MARKETS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF AND THEY ARE THE ONE A THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. SO THERE'S BEEN NEW JOBS AND NEW SCIENCE SO IT IS A JOB CREATOR THERE IS NO REASON. TO LOSE JOBS OVER THIS BILL AND THE ONE MISCONCEPTION THAT WE KEEP HEARING FROM EVERYONE THAT THE OPPOSITION IS DOING A GREAT JOB IN CONFUSING EVERYONE. IS THAT ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS RIGHT NOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INGREDIENTS ARE GRANDFATHERED IN. SO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS JUST NEW INGREDIENTS. AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY IT IS WHAT IS CREATED THAT IS BRAND NEW THAT'S NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE HUNDREDS. AND WE'RE SAYING WE WANT THOSE NEW INGREDIENTS [inaudible] TESTED ALTERNATIVELY NOT ON AN ANIMAL AND THE BEST PART ABOUT THAT IS THOSE ALTERNATIVES SAY OF A TEST ARE SAFER FOR HUMANS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF MISCONCEPTION HERE AND WE ARE SO HAPPY TO CLEAR IT UP AND WE'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS AND AND PEOPLE HAVE EVEN COME OFF THE BILL OPPOSITION HAVE ANY INCOME OFF THE BILL. BUT WE THOUGHT HE HAD THAT SHOULD BE COVERED LET'S PUT IT IN THERE GUY OKAY WE'RE GONNA STICK TO THAT. DURING THE QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN THE SCOPE I SHAN'T. SAY LASTLY I'D I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU ON BESIDES THE FTA EXEMPTION PUT ANOTHER AGENCIES BECAUSE I'M TOLD THERE ARE WE ALMOST RAN A BILL ABOUT WATER QUALITY TESTS ON FISH. SO WITH SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE SOME BLOCKS THERE'S THERE ARE OTHER AGENCIES THAT SOMETIMES REQUIRE TESTING THANK YOU SO YOU MIGHT ONCE HAVE BEEN CUT IS HERE VERY BRIEFLY FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE CHINA THING JUST TO HAVE IT ON RECORD AND THEN. YEAH AND I HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SO WE DO WOULD YOU LIKE TO HER NOW WOULD YOU. BUT AFTER IS FINE AND AGAIN I GO I'M GONNA VOTE YESTERDAY AND YOU KNOW I I HOPE THAT THESE CAN ALL BE ANSWERED SO EVERYONE CAN VOTE YES. THINK THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISS FRIEDMAN -- ON THAT CHINA PIECE AND THE DEAL THAT JOHN PAUL MITCHELL CUT WITH CHINA. AS COMPANIES AND IS MULTI NATIONAL GLOBAL COMPANIES WE RELY ON CERTAINTY AND WE FOLLOW THE RULES WE COMPLY WITH FORMAL REQUIREMENTS FROM FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM STATE GOVERNMENT THAT'S WHAT WE DO. SO WE CAN'T RELY ON THIS DEAL ALSO CALLED DO YOU KNOW THAT A COMPANY CUT WITH -- THE COUNTRY OF CHINA THAT GIVES US NO CERTAINTY AT ALL -- ONE THING THAT I DO WANT TO FLAG THAT ON THIS ME KUSA POINTED OUT ABOUT JOBS BEING CREATED IN THE U.. WE ARE SUPPORTING FULL ALIGNMENT WITH THE EU TO BE VERY CLEAR. WE WANT TO AND ANIMAL TOUGH OKAY HAS PASSED BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS QUESTION SO WE WILL. CONTINUE OUR THEIR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. IF NOT I HAVE A FEW. I AM SO. THIS GALGIANI AYE I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING US FOR IS SOMEBODY WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT ANIMALS -- YOU KNOW ON FIRST BLUSH OF COURSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK AND YOU YOU'RE HEARING IT FROM MY COLLEAGUES ALL OF US WHO ARE -- EXTREMELY PROGRESSIVE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY -- EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA OF STOPPING TESTING ON ANIMALS ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US WHO SPEND A LOT ON COSMETICS -- THERE'S A FEW OF US. AND PREFER NOT TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LABEL AND SO I'M GRATEFUL. ON THE OTHER HAND AYE YOU HAVE SOME THE MOST AGAIN PROGRESSIVE MEMBERS LEGISLATURE THAT ARE NOW. ASKING YOU TO REVIEW SOME OF THESE ISSUES. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT -- THAT THAT ISSUES WITH CHINA. AND AS WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC IN A DIFFERENT AGE I MIGHT OF TOWARD YOU IT'S OKAY FOR CALIFORNIA USER MARKETPLACE. TO CHANGE RULES IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY BUT THE REALITY IS WE'RE UNDER PRESIDENCY -- WHO REALLY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING CALIFORNIA JOBS AND -- HAS CREATED SOMEWHAT OF A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA. I WOULD HEAT FOR OUR JOBS IN CALIFORNIA OR THE UNITED STATES -- TO BECOME SUBJECT TO SOME INTERNATIONAL -- DISPUTES THAT NO WILL BE RESOLVED BY. TWENTY TWENTY AND SO IF I'M FEELING LIKE I'M BEING PLACED IN A POSITION WHERE I'M BEING ASKED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO VALUES THAT I HOLD VERY DEAR. VERY HERE I MEAN I I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE TRYING TO PROTECT AMERICAN JOBS THAT IS WHERE I COME FROM A MORE WORKER ADVOCATE I GUARANTEE YOU. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR ME IN ANY SITUATION TO SAY. WELL THAT THE JOBS COULD GO WE COULD DO A STOREFRONT CHINA IT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN SOMEHOW ADDRESS. THIS ASPECT IN VOTING YES TODAY I ITEM. CLEARLY IN SUPPORT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE BUT THAT CONCERNS ME. I HAVE A QUICK CONCERN I SEE I THINK AS WELL WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE EEO AT I GOT A NUMBER OF TWEETS A SAYS WE JUST WANT WAY WITH YOUR POWER. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT THIS LAW SAYS AND WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS IN THEIR LAW AND WHY AM I HEARING TWO DIFFERENT STORIES ABOUT WHETHER ADOPTING? YOU THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS OR WERE ACTUALLY CREATING A STANDARD THAT'S HIGHER THAN THAT IF I COULD GET. BOTH THE OPPOSITION AND THE PROPONENTS TO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME IN THEIR OWN TERMS. SO WHAT THINK THE EUROPEAN UNION DEAD. NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WAS A SET UP A SYSTEM WHEREBY OVER TIME. THE CUT OF THEIR EUROPEAN UNION COSMETICS MARKET WOULD BE. CREW MORE AND MORE CRUELTY FREE. AND SO THE FINAL LAW WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED IN -- TW THOUSAND THIRTEEN SAID THAT -- ANY INGREDIENTS OR COSMETICS HAD BEEN TESTED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BECAUSE YOU HAVE TELEMARKETING. BAND IN ORDER TO PREVENT TESTERS FROM JUST GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES. COULD NOT BE SOLD IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. NOW THEY CREATED OVER THAT OVER TIME THE COURTS IN THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF CREATED TO EXEMPTIONS ONE AS FOR INTERNATIONAL TESTING WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT WHAT CHINA. REQUESTING REQUIREMENTS AND ONE IS FOR THEIR REACH LEGISLATION WHICH IS A CHEMICAL TESTING LEGISLATION. FOR INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS. SO THOSE ARE THOSE OF A SANCTION. ARBIL HOUSE EXEMPTIONS FOR PRODUCTS TESTED BY THIRD PARTIES. UP FOR IT UNDER REGULATORY REQUIREMENT [inaudible] SO THAT. IS IT TAKES CARE OF SOME OF THAT COMES -- WHAT WE FIND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IS THAT ALMOST ALL ANIMAL TESTING HER COSMETICS HAS NOW ENDED? EXCEPT IS FOR THESE REQUIREMENTS IN -- CERTAIN COUNTRIES AND SO IF WE WERE TO HAVE A BILL THAT DIDN'T ADDRESS TESTING THAT HAPPENS IN CHINA. IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE FACT. SO EVEN THAT YOU NOW THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT HAS PASSED A RESOLUTION JUST A JUST LAST MONTH. CALLING FOR A GLOBAL BAN ON ANIMALS HOUSE COSMETICS SEEMS THAT THE ORIGINAL YOU LAW FROM FIVE YEARS AGO DIDN'T GO FAR. SO THAT IS A RESOLUTION THAT THEY PASSED LIKE A HOPEFUL RESOLUTION NOT ALONG QUICKLY BUT ALSO SAID HIS LAN. DOES GO FURTHER SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE WANT WAY THE U. HAS. THAT'S INCORRECT WE WANT WERE SEAT WHAT. I'M HEARING PROPONENTS SAY HAS. WE ACTUALLY ARE ASKING CALIFORNIA DO MORE THAN THAT YOU TO IT. IS THAT CORRECT WERE WERE MOVING WERE MOVING THE NEEDLE FORWARD BUT WERE GIVEN THEM UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO. YES THERE'S THIS GAPING HOLE CALLED CHINA AND YOU KNOW THAT. IF HE CONTINUES FOR EVER THEN NOTHING IS GETTING DONE THAT'S NEW SO THAT'S THE CUT OFF IS TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THIS BILL I AND I'M SORRY TO DO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY DISTURBING TO ME BECAUSE I IT TOOK THIS BILL TO UNDERSTAND -- THAT MOST THE PRODUCTS I'M PURCHASE SCENE LA AND THEY'VE BEEN TESTED ON ANIMALS THAT'S NOT TRUE BECAUSE I HAVE A GOOD REFERENCE. FOR BONDIES MAKE UP BOTH I'M SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT TRUE HOWEVER THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THE BECAUSE MAKES I'M PURCHASING HAVE BEEN TEST ON ANIMALS. THE IF THE IMPRESSION GIVEN TO ME BY THE ADVOCATES IS -- THAT THAT IS HAPPENING HERE. SOMEWHERE RIGHT IN THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THAT WHICH I'M ALL IN FAVOR. I AM NOW HERE IN HERE AND I JUST WANT. AND VOTING FOR THIS TODAY I JUST I THINK THESE ISSUES HOW WE'RE NOT GETTING IT OFF THE FLOOR THE ASSEMBLY WITHOUT THESE ISSUES BEING ADDRESSED. THAT'S MY FEELING RIGHT NOW. AND IF YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT IS MOVING THE NEEDLE SPECIFICALLY ME UP MOVING THE NEEDLE ON TESTING IN CHINA. THAT'S A DIFFERENT. GOAL THAN I THOUGHT WE ORIGINALLY AT IS THAT THAT IS THE GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT JUST. THAT WE DON'T TEST HERE BUT THAT WE GET THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES. IS THAT CORRECT. NO THAT THE THAT THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN CALIFORNIANS. BUYING COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS IF THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE CRUELTY FREE. AND SO YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF TESTING YOU HAVE TESTING. BECAUSE OF CHINESE OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS -- OR YOU HAVE INGREDIENT INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENT. AND SO THAT THAT COULD BE HAPPENING -- FOR INGREDIENTS THAT GO INTO COSMETICS HERE OR IN OTHER COUNTRIES. I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE THING WIN WE PASSED THIS LAW IN CALIFORNIA IT'S SAID THAT WE WANT TO END THE ANIMAL TESTING FOR COSMETICS. BUT WHAT IT ALSO SAID IS WHERE THERE'S ALTERNATIVES. THERE IS NOT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM ON THAT SO THERE REALLY IS NO GUARANTEE WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THE LOOK INSIDE THESE LABS TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE USING ALTERNATIVES AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO REPORT. SO THIS LIKE SHE SAYS IF ITS CRUELTY FREE WE WANT TO KNOW ITS CRUELTY FREE. AND THIS IS A WAY OF MOVING THAT FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIANS AND PUTTING SOME KIND OF DEADLINE ON THIS INTERNATIONAL [inaudible] KILLEEN TORTURING OTHER ANIMALS THAT THEN [inaudible] TEENS. EVERYBODY'S MAKEUP ES DE LAWEDRE SAYS ON THEIR WEBSITE CRUELTY FREE BELOW IT'S NOT. IF THEY'RE TESTING OVER IN CHINA ON THE ANIMALS WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF THEY'RE TESTING AND CHINA ARE THEIR TESTING CALIFORNIA THEIR TESTING ON ANIMALS. THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY ITS CRUELTY FURRY. SO WHAT WE'RE BUYING IS WERE BUYING WHAT THEY WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT'S NOT TRUE. SO SO I'M JUST GONNA POST THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION I DON'T NEED AN ANSWER TO THIS BUT I THINK IT'S VERY REALISTIC FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME WHO IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PRODUCTS MADE IN CHINA. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LABOR. CONDITIONS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULES THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWED IN CHINA I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE RULES THAT WE ASSUME ABOUT PRODUCTS IN GENERAL. THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO MOVE COSMETIC MANUFACTURERS WHO STILL EXIST IN THE UNITED STATES TO CHINA I WOULD MUCH RATHER -- AND FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH AMERICAN MADE PRODUCTS THAT I WOULD ON ANY CHINESE ME PRODUCT I MEAN I'M I'M. YOU KNOW SO BUT THEN WE MUST WEEK WE MUST ASK OURSELVES IF CHINA IS UNWILLING TO CHANGE THE ROLES ARE WE IN FACT PUSHING THESE MANUFACTURERS. TO CHINA SO THAT THEY CAN AVOID THE TESTING OF ANIMAL TESTING THAT'S REQUIRED MY UNDERSTANDING IS IN CHINA ONLY IF THINGS MADE. OUTSIDE OF CHINA IF GOD I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S WIENER SCENE LA. AND THE THE UNKNOWN CONSEQUENCES OF ACTUALLY MOVING WHERE WE HAVE MORE PRODUCTS MADE IN CHINA DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A AS OUTWARD GOAL THAT WE WANT AND SO I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACTUAL. EFFECT OF THIS LEGISLATION NOT THE INTENT BUT THE EFFECT OF WHAT THIS LEGISLATION COULD MEAN. AND IT WAS HYPOTHETICAL BUT YOU CAN ANSWER WHAT IS ONE OF ACTUALLY BRUCE WE CALL ATTENTION TO THE SCIENCE BECAUSE WE MONITOR CHINA AND WE ACTUALLY -- HAVE WE AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HELP SUPPORT TRAINING OF REGULATORS AND SCIENTISTS IN CHINA -- THEIR INSTITUTE FOR IN VITRO SIGNED BY HIM TO STOP YOU. THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT HEARING WHAT MY GOD. HEAR WHAT KIND OF TRAINING IS BEING DONE IN CHINA I DO NOT TRUSTS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S MANUFACTURER OR RULES I MEAN TRYING IF I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING MADE. CURRENTLY MADE IN UNITED STATES SENT TO CHINA ME PERIODS AND CARE HOW WELL IT IS I DON'T WANT IT SENT TO MEXICO TO BE MADE I DON'T WANT TO SET CANADA BE ME I WENT MADE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. SAU. OKAY BUT BUT YOU STARTED ANSWERING LIKE HOW WELL YOU TRAIN THEIR REGULAR TO USE ALTERNATIVE METHODS OKAY SO WHERE JUST HOPEFUL THAT THEY CHANGE THEIR LAWS. AND THEY ARE IN THEIR MOVING THAT WAY BUT WHEN WE WILL BUT CALM THE MECCA OF CRUELTY FREE THE JOBS WILL COME A YEAR I AM I WAS ALSO. PULLING OUT BECAUSE THEY KNOW MYSTERIOUS ALSO HAD SOME QUESTIONS ALONG THE SAME LINES AGAIN I WANT TO KNOW TO THE MISTRESS WAS SUPPORTING THE BILL TO DATE SHE'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. SO I WOODS SAY TO THE AUTHOR INTO THE SUPPORTERS -- WE MIGHT NEED TO CONTINUE HAVE DISCUSSIONS BEFORE THIS IS TAKEN UP ON THE FLOOR BUT WITHOUT IT DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION EGGMAN BETTER. MAY RESPOND NOW YOUR QUESTION I'M SORRY NOW BECAUSE WE'RE JUST AND WE PROTECT MY PUBLIC TIME TOO LONG AND AND MISTER BIGELOW WAS. GOT A QUESTION [inaudible] OKAY.

THANKS SO MUCH THE BILL HAS BEEN NARROWED. AND IT'S OBVIOUS IN THE ANALYSIS HOW IT WAS AND I'VE CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE -- TO ENACT THESE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR FAMILIES TO HELP PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE ASK YOUR SUPPORT ME HAVE SUPPORTERS SUPPORTERS. HI AMANDA WILCOX HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE -- I WILL LIMIT MY REMARKS TO THE FISCAL ISSUE -- ONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL IS TO WEIGH THE FILING AND SERVICE FEE FOR THOSE SEEKING A COMBINES RESTRAINING ORDER THIS WAIVER IS SIMILAR TO THE FEE WAIVERS THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS. FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE DON'T WANT THIS LEGAL TOOL TO DISARM SOMEONE DANGEROUS ONLY AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE HAVE THE MONEY. OUGHT TO PETITION FOR THE ORDER -- BUT I ALSO ADD THAT THE ORDER HAS NOT BEEN USED MUCH. A IN PART BECAUSE THE LAW WHEN ENACTED STATED THAT THIS SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO REMOVE THE FIREARMS. THAT SHOULD BE USED FIRST -- AND WE'RE FINDING THAT PRIMARILY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS USING THIS TOOL AND OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT GONNA CHARGE THEMSELVES A FEE WHEN THEY ARE -- ISSUED AN EMERGENCY ORDER -- AND THEN OF COURSE ANY FEE IS OFFSET BY THE OTHER COST TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO COMMUNITIES OF WHEN THEY'RE A SHOOTING DOES HAPPEN IF THAT CAN BE AVOIDED -- THAT SAVE MONEY COSTS AND OF COURSE THE MORAL COSTS AND I KNOW THAT. THE PRICE LOSING SOMEONE TO GUNFIRE -- THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION THAT WASN'T COVERED BY THE ANALYSIS IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR COURTS.

SIX FIFTY SIX I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT HERE I GO MY MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I S. B. SIX FIFTY IT'S YOUR RIGHT TO PRESENT IT'S MY RIGHT TO GIVE YOU HELL. LET'S NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. S. B. SIX FIVE SIX ADDRESSES A UNIQUE FORMULA CONCERNED IN THE JUDGE'S RETIREMENT SYSTEM. TO WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THE FORMULA IS A HYBRID DEFINED CONTRIBUTION AND DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN. SO TWENTY FOUR YEARS LATER WE'RE OBSERVING IT DEFICIENCIES THAT NEED TO BE CORRECTED THE STATE SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES ARE THE ONLY CALIFORNIA JOB CLASSIFICATION IN SUCH A PLAN AS FAR AS I AM AWARE OF WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THE PAST TWO YEARS TO ADD A MINOR. TAB MINOR AMENDMENTS TO THE PLAN WHILE MINIMIZING COST TO THE JUDICIARY BRANCH. I CERTAINLY ORANGE COUNTY PLAY RETIREMENT SYSTEM BOARD FOR TWELVE YEARS AND AM VERY FOCUSED ON FAIR AND SUSTAINABLE. PENSION BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE ACTUAL REAL COST IS TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AMORTIZED OVER TWENTY YEARS. I BELIEVE THE MORALE BOOST IN THE PREDICTED PRODUCTIVITY THAT WILL RESULT FROM IT THESE MODIFICATIONS WILL BE MORE THAN. OFFSETTING THAT THE COST WILL BE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S RESIDENTS. AND THE TWENTY ONE MILLION IS A VERY LIBERAL CALCULATION WITH THE ACTUAL COST ANTICIPATED TO BE LOWER. WE DO THE TAXPAYERS SUPPORT SERVICE BY WATCHING A JUDGE CONTINUE TO SERVE ON THE BENCH WHILE IN DURING CHEMO TREATMENT IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF YEARS SERVICE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT. A SPOUSE RECEIVES A RETIREMENT INCOME SHOULD THE TREATMENT PROVED TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT. J. ARREST TO IS STRONGLY FUNDED AND GOVERNOR BROWN HAS APPOINTED NUMEROUS JUDGES WHO DESERVE FAIRNESS IN THEIR COMPENSATION PACKAGES. I'LL GET TO SPLIT MY WITNESSES GET TO SPECIFICS BUT MADAM CHAIR S. B. SIX FIVE SIX HAS RECEIVED THE TITLE OF THE JUDICIAL FAIRNESS ACT TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR A REASON. THE AWKWARD NINE INCENTIVES IN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE SHOULD BE REMEDIED THIS BILL A SPARE IT IMPROVE MORALE AND IT TREATS JUDGES IN A SIMILAR MANNER AS THE BARGAINING GROUPS THEY WORK WITH. ADVERTISING TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWENTY YEARS IS A SMALL STIPEND THAT WILL RETURN DIVIDENDS IN MULTIPLES AND RICK CROONING AND RETAINING JUDGES. I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH CALPERS AND HAVE TAKEN THEIR AMENDMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS SENATOR RICARDO LARA IS A JOINT AUTHOR N. ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BRO IN COOLEY OUR PRINCIPAL COAUTHORS AND CINNAMON CALDERON IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. I RECEIVED SOME EIGHT HUNDRED SIGNATURES FROM JUDGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN SUPPORT AND IT IS MY REQUEST THE S. B. SIX FIFTY SIX BE REMOVED FROM SUSPENSE AT THE EARLIEST TIME CONVENIENTLY POSSIBLE AND BROUGHT TO THE ASSEMBLY FOR HER APPROVAL. LET ME ALLOW MY TWO WITNESSES TO PROVIDE JUDICIAL LOTS OF VACANT MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I'LL BE VERY BRIEF MY NAME IS LAURIE DAMN WELL AND I'M A NEW JUDGE AT THE SACRAMENTO SUPERIOR COURT I'M I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING NOT ON BEHALF OF THE SACRAMENTO SUPERIOR COURT OR ANY PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION. BUT RATHER AS AN INDIVIDUAL JUDGE SEEING THIS THROUGH THE PRISM OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A MOTHER AS A WIFE AS A PERSON COMMITTED TO SERVING IN PUBLIC SIERRA SERVICE FOR YEARS TO COME. I FEEL PRIVILEGED HAVE BEEN APPOINTED JUST LAST YEAR AND I SINCERELY HOPE THAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO SERVE AS A JUDGE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE PLUS YEARS. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THINGS HAPPEN AND SOMETIMES IT JUST DOESN'T WORK THE WAY WE PLAN AND THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT REALITY -- CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE JUDGE STEVE PARK FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PANCREATIC CANCER AT AGE SIXTY THREE AFTER NINETEEN YEARS OF SERVICE. DOCTORS GAVE HIM FOUR TO SIX MONTHS TO LIVE UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE WRONG BUT AT THE TIME HE KNEW HE HAD TO SURVIVE TO THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE TO GET A DEFINED BENEFIT FOR HIS WIFE. A DISABILITY RETIREMENT WAS WORTH ABOUT A THIRD OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT PAYOUT HE HAD BEEN COUNTING ON FOR HIS FAMILY'S FINANCIAL SECURITY. AS IT WAS HE WISE IT S. B. SIX FIVE SIX WHERE THE LA HE COULD HAVE LAUGHED WHEN HE REACHED TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE IN ASSURING HIS WIFE OF FINANCIAL SECURITY. AS IT IS HE PUT IN NEARLY A FULL YEAR IN EL HEALTH AFTER HIS TWENTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY IS A JUDGE JUST TO AVOID LEAVING HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WITH LESS THAN HALF OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT THEY WERE COUNTING ON THIS IS NOT THE ONLY JUDGE WHO SUFFERED FROM THIS. TYPE OF EXPERIENCE AND IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE -- AS A NEWLY APPOINTED JUDGE I'M AWARE I'M AS WELL OF A NUMBER OF WELL QUALIFIED LAWYERS MY FORMER PEERS WHO SEE THIS LACK OF SECURITY IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO PURSUING A JUDGESHIP. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THIS TYPE OF CLIFF VESTING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR EVEN IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR -- THIS AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS LEGISLATION IS A VERY MODEST FIXED THAT WOULD HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF MY COLLEAGUES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES IN WITHOUT AND FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I CAN'T HAMLIN I'M A JUDGE OF THE FRESNO SUPERIOR COURT FOR NINETEEN AND A HALF YEARS. AND A DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE CALIFORNIA JUDGES SPONSOR FOR THIS BILL -- I APPRECIATE YOUR GIVING US A CHANCE TO SPEAKABOUT THIS BILL I HAVE JUST ONE MORE TRAGIC EXAMPLE WOULD GIVE TO YOU. APPALLED BOARDMAN A JUDGING TULARE COUNTY POINTED AT AGE FIFTY NINE PUT IN TEN YEARS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER TERMINAL CANCER -- SPENT THE LAST YEAR ON THE BENCH IN. LIKE PRESERVING. CARE SO THAT HE COULD REACH HIS RETIREMENT AGE. AND NOT DENIED HIS WIFE A DECENT RETIREMENT. I HE DIED FORTY ONE DAYS AFTER HE RETIRED -- THAT WAS AN IMPACT ON THIS COURT ON THE PEOPLE THAT COUNTY. AND A TRAGEDY AS FAR AS HE AND HIS WIFE WONDERING IF HE WAS GOING TO BE LEFT. VIRTUALLY PENNILESS -- LEADING A DAY OR DYING A DAY BEFORE HE REACHED SEVENTY WOULD HAVE COST MORE THAN HALF O THEIR PENSION. AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT KINGS RICHES HERE SHE'S LOOKING AT SOMETHING LESS THAN SIXTY THOUSAND A YEAR BECAUSE HE MADE IT TO THE FINISH LINE. WE WOULD HAVE LEFT THAT WOMAN WITH LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR MARRIED TO HIM FOR FORTY PLUS YEARS THIS IS A MAN WHO. HAS GIVEN A LOT AND THERE'S NO REASON THERE'S NO PUBLIC POLICY REASON FOR JUDGES TO FACE THAT KIND OF HARDSHIP. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEIR SPOUSES AND SURVIVORS WHO DEPEND ON THEM -- THIS BILL IS AS THE SENATOR POINTED OUT AS OVERWHELMING. BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IT'S A VERY SMALL PRICE FOR A SMALL FIX. THAT HELPS TO ADDRESS THE WORST ASPECTS OF THIS BILL WE ARE NOT ASKING. FOR A WHOLE LOT OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE SENSE OF GETTING OUT EARLY EXTRA PAY NOTHING -- THE CALPERS HAS HAD OPINED VIOLATE PEPPER IN THAT IT DOES NOT. PROVIDE ANY ENHANCEMENT ANY EXISTING BENEFIT. NO JUDGE GETS A DOLLAR MORE NO JUDGE GETS A DOLLAR A DAY SOONER. THAN IT THAT JUDGE STATE ON THE BENCH TO RETIREMENT. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS. GOOD MORNING LANCE ITO LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT RETIRED IN STRONG SUPPORT. JOHN ADAMS JUDGE OF THE ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT IN STRONG SUPPORT.
