SENATE BILL FIFTEEN- AND SENATOR PORTANTINO IS HERE TO- PRESENTS WELCOME SENATOR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP FIFTEEN WHICH WILL GIVE INCENTIVES TO CITIES THAT CONVERT ABANDONED RETAIL SITES INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CIVICALLY SB FIFTEEN WILL ENABLE LOCAL CITIES TO RECEIVE FROM H. E. B. THE AVERAGE OF THE ANNUAL. TAX REVENUE GENERATED BY THAT SITE FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS- IF THAT SITE HAS BEEN CONVERTED IN OCCUPIED WITH NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING THESE FISCAL INCENTIVES WILL BE USED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REPLACE THE SALES TAX REVENUE LOSS FROM THE CLOSURE. OF THESE BE BY BIG BOX RETAIL STORES BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THE WAY WE MONETISE LAND USE IT INCENTIVIZES RETAIL OVER HOUSING AND WE'RE TRYING TO FLIP THAT CONTRACT CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING EMERGENCY ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AT TWO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE PROXIMALLY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION NEW HOUSING UNITS ARE NEEDED TO MEET THE PROJECTED POPULATION AND HOUSING GROWTH OR HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND NEW HOMES ANNUALLY. THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS DRIVEN CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING COSTS BE THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION WITH AN AVERAGE MEDIAN HOME PRICE OF. NAP TWO POINT FIVE TIMES THAT OF THE US MEDIA. THESE HIGH PRICES HAVE PROHIBITED OCCUPANTS LIKE TEACHERS NURSES PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS AND YOUNGER PROFESSIONALS THE ABILITY TO AFFORD OWNING A HOME ESSENTIAL FOR BUILDING A STRONG AND VIBRANT ECONOMY. A CURRENT TREND HAS EMERGED IN LOCAL ECONOMICS DUE TO THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NATIONAL RETAILERS HAVE BEEN REDUCING THEIR DEMAND FOR FUTURE SPACE AND RETAIL CENTERS AND ARE CLOSING STORES. THEY'RE BANNING THESE RETAIL SITES AT A PACE GREATER THAN EVEN DURING THE GREAT RECESSION LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A MAJOR ISSUE FOR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA'S COUNTIES. HOUSING AN INCH TRANSLITERATED IS INTRINSICALLY. CONNECTED TO THE WELFARE OF OUR POPULATION AND BUSINESS. LACKING TO ATTAINED HOUSING EMPLOYEE WORK ENVIRONMENTS SUFFER AND THE GREATER ECONOMY IS NEGATIVELY IMPACT. NOW IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSTRUCT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON LAND FORMERLY USED BY COMMERCIAL RETAILERS. GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF FISCAL INCENTIVES. TO ENCOURAGE REZONING APPROVING AND COMPLETING IT ALLOWING OCCUPANCY OF WORKFORCE HOUSING PROJECTS.

THE PRESENTATION. AB JUST BASICALLY BUT I DID MENTION IT AND PRESENTATION CENTER CASKEY. BUT BASICALLY THE IDEA IS TO IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE TO- WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO. ALLOW FOR PETS IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE THAT'S THE IDEA I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS AND CLARIFICATION ON. THE TWENTY NINETEEN AMENDMENTS BECAUSE- YOU'RE OF A CERTAIN AGE LIKE MYSELF THAT WE HAD DOG HOUSES AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHOULD THERE WOULD BE A DOG AND A DOG. HOUSE ON A RELATIVELY CHEAP LEVEL AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE GRANTS THAT WERE GIVEN. TO BE TWENTY ONE AND TWO HUNDRED. THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS THAT FOR THE HOMELESS PERSON THE HOUSING THE HOMELESS PERSON AND A DOG IN A CO HABITATION LEVEL OR SUSPICIOUS FOR THE- ANIMALS BOTH THE VETERINARIANS SAY IT'S ALSO VETERINARY SERVICES. MAKING SURE THAT THE FACILITY CAN BE CONVERTED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE ANIMALS. THE VET SERVICES AND ALL AND THE LIKE BUT IT'S FOR BOTH IT'S BASICALLY TO GIVE. FOLKS TODAY HAVE THESE LIKE LIKE CAR LIKE A CANS PLACE IN THE VALLEY THE- HOPE OF THE VALLEY THE MONEY NECESSARY TO BILL THAT THE FACILITIES TO HANDLE THEM SOMETIMES IN SOME INSTANCES THE ANIMALS ARE SEPARATE FROM SOMETIMES THE ANIMALS ARE RIGHT NEXT TO.

I SAW THE. YEAH. IF YOU WANT HAVE CONCERNS YEAH. OKAY CENTERMAN WELCOME TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE REFER BILL ON THIS COMMITTEE SO WELCOME- AND THIS IS ITEM THREE SB THREE NINETY ONE- CENTERMAN MAY FIRST THANK YOU JERRY THANK YOU TO THE CAN STAFF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB NINETY WHICH IS A PERMISSIVE BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS- BOARDS TO SAFELY MEET VIA TELECONFERENCES DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS- TO ENSURE THAT PARTICIPATION. TO THESE MEETINGS IS ACCESSIBLE TO MEMBERS. THE DAVIS STERLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT REQUIRES THE ID'S TO PROVIDE A PHYSICAL MEETING LOCATION FOR ALL TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS. WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE POSES A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISK IN THE MIDST OF AN ONGOING PANDEMIC. LAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO THIS CURRENT HEALTH CRISIS THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STATE AGENCIES TO MEET AND VOTE REMOTELY. IT KNOW SIMILAR ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR C. ID'S. CONSEQUENTLY CITIES HAVE FACED IMMENSE DIFFICULTIES IN ORGANIZING LAWFUL MEETINGS IN THE MIST OF THE ON GOING PANDEMIC. IN RESPONSE TO THIS THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMITTEE WORK LAST FALL TO CRAFT A NARROW POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. ASSEMBLY WAIVES THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE AN IN PERSON MEETING LOCATION FOR TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS DURING A DECLARED EMERGENCY OR DISASTER. TO STRATFORD THIS ENSURE THAT PARTICIPATION IS ACCESSIBLE TO MEMBERS THIS BILL REQUIRES THE ID'S TO FULFILL THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS. THEY MUST PROVIDE CLEAR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PARTICIPATE. THE MEETING NOTICE MUST INCLUDE THE TELEPHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL THE PERSON WHO CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE TELECONFERENCE PROCESS. BOTH BEFORE AND DURING THE MEETING. THEY MUST ENSURE THAT EVERY DIRECTOR AND MEMBER HAS THE SAME ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING THAT WOULD EXIST IF THE MEETING WERE HELD IN PERSON. ANY VOTER THE DIRECTOR SHALL BE CONDUCTED BY A ROLL CALL VOTE. AND LASTLY PARTICIPANTS MUST BE GIVEN THE OPTION OF PARTICIPATING BY TELEPHONE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT OPPONENTS OF THE BILLS HAVE HAD THIS BILL HAVE RAISED SOME CONCERNS REGARDING ADDITIONAL STEPS WE CAN TAKE. TO ENSURE EASY ACCESS TO PARTICIPATION AND SO AS A RESULT WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE THAT REQUIRES THE ID'S TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUAL NOTICE TO MEMBERS. OF THE FIRST MEETING CONDUCTED DURING EMERGENCY. THE AMENDMENT ALSO REQUIRES C. ID'S TO REMIND MEMBERS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL NOTICE OF THEIR RIGHT TO OFTEN. TO ALL MEETING NOTIFICATIONS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR HOWEVER CURRENT LAW DOES NOT GUARANTEE FAIR AND SAFE PARTICIPATION OF C. ID MEETINGS AS HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR. WE KNOW THAT EMERGENCIES ARE GOING TO LIKELY BE A PART OF OUR WAY OF LIFE- WILDFIRES GLOBAL PANDEMICS WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF RECENT EMERGENCIES THAT SHOW THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE. OR SAFE FORTY IDEAS TO PROVIDE IN PERSON MEETING LOCATIONS- THAT'S WHY SB THREE NINETY ONE AGAIN A PERMISSIVE BILL THAT SIMPLY GIVES THE ID'S AND OPTION FOR MEETING DURING OFFICIALLY DECLARED EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS. IS URGENTLY NEEDED AND WE HAVE WITH US TODAY- BRIAN HEY BEAR- OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW COMMISSION PROVIDE TESTIMONY. AS WELL AS DIRECT PETROL A COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION'S ATTORNEY FROM ORANGE COUNTY. WHOSE FIRM PROVIDES LEAVE COUNCILS FOR HUNDREDS OF SUCH ASSOCIATIONS. TWENTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE CENTER IN TERMS OF THE AMENDMENTS- I THINK WERE ACCEPTING THEM RIGHT YES YEAH. BUT MOST OF ALARM THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US SENATE OVER. SOME OF OPPOSITION THAT MAYBE DIDN'T THAT WE WERE WORKING AS A MEMBERS WITH AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY SO- EACH LEAD SUPPORTER AND SORT OF PROPONENTS TO RECEIVE- TO MET- TWO MINUTES IF THERE'S ONLY ONE LEAD OPPONENT- WILL BE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE THERE SO THAT WE HAVE- PARITY IN TIME. SORLEY'S SUPPORTERS ARE I BELIEVE THIS IS BRIAN HIBBARD AND DARK OUT TOTAL- SO WE'LL START WITH- BRIAN- HUBER. AND AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN GO ABOUT GETTING YOUR MINISTRY TO OKAY YES GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRIAN HUBERT ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE LAW REVISION COMMISSION BOB QUINN- THE STATE'S FIRST HAD TO STAY AT HOME ORDERS THE COMMISSION WAS STRUGGLING A BIT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOLD OPEN MEETINGS. BECAUSE THAT APPLICABLE STATE OPEN MEETING ACT REQUIRES THAT THERE BE A PHYSICAL LOCATION PER TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS- WE- SOLVE THAT BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WAIVING THAT REQUIREMENT BUT IT MADE US AWARE OF THE FACT THAT- COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS WE'RE GONNA BE FACING THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS WHAT HELPED THEM- SO WE DECIDED TO QUICKLY. DEVELOP AND TURN AROUND A RECOMMENDATION WITH SIMILAR FACT FOR COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT MEETINGS. IT WAS INTENTIONALLY NARROW. THE ONLY THAT IT. WHEN CAN PURCHASE REQUIRE FOR TELECOM NEED AND IDEA WELL WE ADDED. PROCEDURAL ROUTE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NAY AFFECTED THE WAIVER WOULD NOT UNDULY INTERFERE WITH MEMBERS ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE MEETINGS. AND FINALLY WE- RECOMMENDED THAT IT BE AN URGENCY MEASURE BECAUSE IN OUR WORK WE LEARNED THAT MANY SEE AIDID'S WE'RE GOING AT AND HOLDING. MEETINGS IN KILEY BY TELECONFERENCING VIOLATION OF THE YOUNG PERSON REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT CASTS A SORT OF A CLOUD ON THE LEGITIMACY OF ACTIONS TAKEN AT THOSE MEETINGS. AND THE COMMISSION BELIEVE THAT IT WAS URGENT TO PUT A FIX IN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO LET'S SEE I CAN GET BACK ON TO A CLEARLY LEGAL BUT IT FOR THEIR MEETINGS- I'M AVAILABLE. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE HAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL NOW. GO TO THE NEXT LEAD TO OUR PROPONENT REGISTERED PETROL HONEST APPROACH WE ALSO HAVE A TWO MINUTE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- MY NAME IS PHOTO ON THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY AND ARE FROM WORKING IN TOUCH ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY EXCLUSIVELY REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT TO SEE AIDID'S. WE REPRESENT HUNDREDS OF THEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO WITH THE VERY THE VERY QUICK ONSET OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE SAW MANY SEE AIDID'S FACED WITH VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES- THAT IS ALREADY BEEN REFERENCE THE- OPEN MEETING ACT FOR COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT EXPRESSLY REQUIRES THE HOLDING OPEN OF A PHYSICAL LOCATION FOR MEMBERS TO ATTEND. HOWEVER VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND MANDATES PREVENTED THOSE GATHERINGS AND FURTHER EVEN IF THEY TECHNICALLY DID NOT VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS RESIDENTS IN PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT THAT VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HOLDING SUCH PHYSICAL LOCATION OPEN FOR THOSE MEETINGS. SO AS SUCH AS A VERY CREEK CRITICAL AND VERY BUSY TIME IT BECAME REALLY DIFFICULT FOR OUR VOLUNTEER BOARDS TO DO THEIR JOB. AND UNLIKE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT SAW THE BROWN ACT SUSPENDED IN LIGHT OF ALL OF THE THINGS TO GIVE THEM OTHER OPTIONS THAT DID NOT OCCUR FOR THE C. AIDID'S. SO AS SUCH BY NECESSITY MANY COMMUNITIES BEGAN OPENING CAN- CONDUCTING OPEN MEETING. WITHOUT A PHYSICAL LOCATION AND THE TREND QUICKLY SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE AND WHAT WE SAW IS THAT ENABLE IN ATTENDANCE FROM. HOME BY PHONE OR VIDEO SO EITHER RESIDENTS ARE BOARD MEMBERS NEED TO LEAVE THEIR HOME OR FAMILY TO PARTICIPATE IS PROTECTED RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS FROM EXPOSURE TO COLD NINETEEN WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN OUR AGE RESTRICTED COMMUNITIES. AND IN A LITTLE COMMITTEES TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AT A CRITICAL TIME WHEN FAMILIES WERE STICKING CLOSE TO HOME MORE THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEFORE OR- SO IN THE END IT'S BEEN OBSERVED BY EVERYBODY IN THE INDUSTRY THAT THIS THAT THIS TRANSITION DRAMATICALLY INCREASED COMMUNITY MEMBER INVOLVEMENT- AND WE'VE SEEN MANY ASSOCIATIONS AND I JUST WAS SPEAKING TO ONE TODAY AN AGE RESTRICTED ASSOCIATION. SAID LITERALLY THE PARTICIPATION IN THEIR IN THEIR MEETING HAS MORE. THAN DOUBLED DURING THE LAST TWELVE SO OVER THE REASONS I STRONG SAID. THE OF A THREE ONE. WHICH OKADA THIS PRACTICE I TRULY BELIEVE IT'S NOT THE- IN BETTER. FOR ALL CAN SO. AND IMPORTANTLY EVERY. AND THE OWNER AND- READ WITHIN HIM. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE WE WILL BUT ONE MOMENT PLEASE. OKAY THANK YOU WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO TO SUPPORT OF.

JENNIFER WATER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGER WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND FRAN WE NEED YOU NEED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE AMENDMENT THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THE BILL MAHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M MORE TRYING TO FIFTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS ROBERT NICKEL ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTING ACTION COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL NOW GO TO- OPPOSITION TO SB THREE NINETY ONE. WE DO HAVE ONE THIS IS A PARTNER WHO IS WITH US HERE TODAY AND THAT IS MARJORIE MURRAY FROM THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS. ASSOCIATION LAW- AND SO- IS VERY BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION HAD THE TOTAL PERFORMANCE WILL GRANT WILL BE USED WILL HAVE FOUR MINUTES SINCE ARE NORTH OF THE- WITNESSES SO. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AYE MARJORIE MURRAY. CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION LAW WE ARE A NONPROFIT. WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER AND CIVIL RIGHTS OF ASSOCIATION HOMEOWNERS. WOULD HAVE TAKEN OPPOSE POSITION NOT BECAUSE WE'RE AGAINST THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. O CONVENE ASSOCIATION MEETINGS DURING AN EMERGENCY BUT RATHER WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ITS USE DOES NOT INFRINGE ON. EXISTING RIGHTS OF ASSOCIATION HOMEOWNERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR OWN GOVERNANCE. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED. THE TECHNOLOGY. NOT DELETE THOSE RIGHT. THE LARGEST ITSELF HAS TO CARE DURING THE- STATEWIDE PANDEMIC. TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS CAN STILL PARTICIPATE IN GOVERNANCE LIKE THIS HEARING FOR EXAMPLE. LIKEWISE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT TO HOMEOWNERS IN SELF GOVERNMENT COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO PROTECTED DURING EMERGENCIES. WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING STEPS TO RESOLVE OUR VERY FIRST CONCERN ABOUT THE ISSUE OF NOTIFYING HOMEOWNERS. OF MEETINGS DURING THE EMERGENCY. THAT IS PROVIDING INDIVIDUAL NOTICE TO THE HOMEOWNER THAT A MEETING IS ON THE HORIZON. HOWEVER WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER ISSUES WHICHARE ITEMIZED IN THE ANALYSIS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE MEETING BE RECORDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF ABSENT HOMEOWNERS AND BOARD DIRECTORS A LIGHT. IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN EMERGENCY HOMEOWNERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE ENGAGED IN. TRYING TO RESOLVE INSURANCE ISSUES THEY'RE STANDING IN LINE AT THE FOOD BANK. THERE ARE HOME SCHOOLING THEIR CHILDREN THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR WORK THEY MAY NOT HAVE TIME TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ASSOCIATION BOARD MEETING. SECOND THERE IS THE ISSUE OF THE LEADING THE PHYSICAL LOCATION REQUIREMENTS WELL WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT FROM. A HEALTH POINTOF VIEW PERHAPS IT INFRINGES ON ACTUALLY DELETES AN EXISTING RIGHT TO HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO WITNESS THE TABULATION AND MANAGEMENT. OF VOTING MATERIALS DURING AN ELECTION THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL VOTER RIGHT. SO WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF ELECTRONIC MEETINGS DURING AN EMERGENCY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IT NOT INFRINGING ON OR DELETE EXISTING RIGHTS. UP SINCE THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS AND IS WORKING TOWARDS RESOLVING THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING UP THE OTHER ISSUES OF CONCERN. WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF HOPEFULLY TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OKAY WE WILL NOW GO TO ANY OTHER IN PERSON ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE OPPOSITION PUBLIC COMMENT AGAIN FOR GOING FORWARD WE ASKED FOLKS TO PLEASE THE RIGHT OR YOUR NAME AFFILIATION IF ANY AND THE FACT THAT YOU OPPOSE BUT- MY NAME IS TOM SIR I'M A RETIRED THIS RECORD COMMISSIONER I AM ON THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CENTER THAT MARJORIE MURRAY IS A PRESENT ENOUGH. AND I'M HERE ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE- CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF RETIRED AMERICANS IF THERE'S ANY TIME LEFT FOR THE LEAD I HAD TO HAVE SOME FOR THEIR STATEMENTS YES I WOULD LIKE TO ADD OR WAS ABOUT FORTY FIVE SECONDS LEFT SO WE'RE ANTICIPATING SECOND LEAD WITNESS ON BEHALF OF THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY MIGHT BE CALLING IN. BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S HOW IT YES SO YOU. HAVE THEM BOB YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE FORTY SO. WHICH ALL START NOW AND ALL RIGHT I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE- HAVING A LIVE MEETING WHERE THERE'S COUNTING OF BALLOTS TAKES PLACE. NOTING THAT IN THE RECENT FEDERAL ELECTION. OF THE SCORES OF LAWSUITS FILED BY A FORMER PRESIDENT CHALLENGING. THE ELECTION THE OLD ONE CASE THAT PREVAILED ON BEHALF OF OUR FORMER PRESIDENT. HAD TO DO WITH IT WITNESSING OF COUNTING OF BALLOTS. IT'S AN ESSENTIAL PART. OF THE EXERCISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC ELECTION THAT THAT PROVIDES THE- HUH SURE INSTEAD IT THE ELECTIONS CONDUCTED FAIRLY AND THAT THE- PUBLIC CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE CORRECT SO IF WE DON'T HAVE. ACTUAL IN PERSON WITNESSING OF THE COUNTING OF THE BALLOTS IT LEAVES THE GATE WIDE OPEN FOR SHENANIGANS WITH ELECTIONS WHICH WE HAVE HEARD MANY MANY CASES. FROM ALL AROUND THE STATE THAT INCUMBENT BOARDS IN OFFICERS WILL DO ANYTHING TO REMAIN IN OFFICE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT. OKAY IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION TESTIMONY ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE. THING NINE IS THERE ANY ONE IN OPPOSITION ROOM TWENTY FORTY.SEVEN NINE WILL NOW GO TO THE PHONE LINES AND AGAIN FOR EVERYONE WAITING TO THIS IS OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. TO SB THREE NINETY ONE. FOR EACH PERSON WE WILL ASK YOU TO STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION IF ANY AND THE FACT THAT YOU OPPOSE- BUT OF OPERATOR CAN YOU ASK PEOPLE TO QUEUE UP AND THEN LET ME KNOW HOW MANY OPPOSITION SPEAKERS THERE ARE. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB THREE NINETY ONE. PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO OUT DESCRIBING. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY AND COULD YOU JUST MAKE ONE MORE CALL FOR THE. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB THREE NINE NINE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT WALDRON YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF AN OPERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- SENATOR- CABALLERO WOMEN'S CENTER MIKE POUNCEY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- THERE WERE SEVERAL- SUGGESTIONS THAT ARE ARE IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS AND IT FOR CHANGE AND- WHAT I IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERE WAS ONLY ONE. OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU TOOK SENATOR MAN I SAID ON JUDICIARY IF THIS GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE IT'S GOING TO MOVE ON TO JUDICIARY- BUT I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT- THAT I AGREE WITH WITH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED- I THINK THAT IT M. IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW C. ID'S TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE. BOB WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY SO I GRANT YOU THAT- SO TO WAIVE THE IN PERSON REQUIREMENTS IS GOOD BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- EVERY INDIVIDUAL THAT ARE PART OF THE C. ID RECEIVE SOME KIND OF NOTICE THAT DIDN'T THE MEETING IS NOT GOING TO BE HELD IN PERSON WHETHER THAT'S- THROUGH A TEXT OR AN EMAIL OR AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS TO. TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTUATE IN INDIVIDUAL DELIVERY NOW THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU SEND THAT LETTER THROUGH THE MAIL- I THINK THERE HOULD BE A PHYSICAL LOCATION FOR BALLOT COUNTING- OF COURSE SOME WAY THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THE INFORMATION IF THAT IF THERE'S NOT A PHYSICAL LOCATION THE BALLOTS ARE KEPT AND SOMEBODY CAN LOOK AT A MAP AFTER THE FACT IF THEY WANT TO. I THINK THE RETURN MEETING SHOULD BE RECORDED EVERYTHING GETS RECORDED NOW AND- MOST OF THAT PUBLIC PLATFORMS YOU CAN USE- ALLOW YOU TO RECORD IT SO THAT IF I'M BUSY WHEN THE MEETINGS BEING HELD AND I WANT TO SEE IT THE NEXT MORNING OR SOMETHING THAT I HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND I DO THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IF THE RULES ARE VIOLATED THERE SHOULD BE A WAY FOR ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE- C. ID TO FILE A COMPLAINT OR A CHALLENGE AND THAT IT BE HEARD SOMEWHERE SO- WHETHER IT'S THAT BROWN ACT- ABABNEH PROCESSOR OR SOMETHING ELSE I'M NEUTRAL ON THAT BUT I DO. THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME KIND OF REMEDY. SHE OF HAVING TO GO COURT LEAST. BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'M PREPARED TO MOVE THE BILL IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE OKAY SO THAT IS A- BUT MOTION. TO DISMISS. THE PATH AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMANDED A SHORT BREATH- CENTER ACCOUNTS. I TO SIT ON JUDICIARY SELFIE SEEN THIS AGAIN BUT- I WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE H. AWAY CHANGES THAT REQUIRE PHYSICAL PRESENCE AND FOR COUNTING OF BALLOTS THAT THERE WAS. A LOT OF PAIN AND SUFFERING THAT WENT THROUGH GETTING THOSE CHANGES TO THE H. AWAY SO I GUESS I'D LIKE TO SEE HERE RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM RURAL SALINAS- WHAT YOU'RE- WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ON THE BILL- IT'S BECAUSE- BEEN. COME UP AND THE ALLEGE IT'S SUCH AN INTEGRAL OF THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE ON THE OPERATIONS OF A CHOICE. HI MISTER CHAIR DO I HAVE PERMISSION TO RESPOND DRIVE JUST CRIED- SO THIS IS SOMETHING I'M HAPPY TO HAVE MY WITNESSES WHEN HERE'S WELL BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS. CONSIDERED AND I WAS RAISED IN MEETINGS WITH A LOT OF YOU COMMISSION BUT- I THINK ULTIMATELY THERE WERE CONCERNS ON THE FLIP SIDE WHICH IS IN A IN A CURRENT PANDEMIC. FOURTEEN A WILDFIRE A PHYSICAL LOCATION ACTUALLY WOULD EXCLUDE A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM PARTICIPATING. BECAUSE THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE FOLKS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE RELUCTANT TO COME TO IN PERSON BOKE TABULATIONS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. OR OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DURING CERTAIN TYPES OF EMERGENCIES RIGHT AND AGAIN THIS IS A PERMISSIVE MEASURE. THAT ONLY APPLIES WHEN THERE'S AN OFFICIAL THE CARD MERGING SEA- AND SO I THINK THE THOUGHT WAS THAT A TELECOM VIDEO CONFERENCE. WHERE THE VOTES WERE ACTUALLY SEEN OVER CAMERAS WOULDBE. MORE PARTICIPATORY THEN IN IN PERSON UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO THAT WAS THE THINKING BEHIND IT- AND SO YOU KNOW IS JUST KIND OF A TRADE OFF THING BUT OF COURSE I HIGH VALUE. YOU KNOW I I'VE YOU HOAS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT FORM OF DEMOCRACY AND WE ARE NOT IN THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO TRY TO. DISENFRANCHISE ANYONE OR TAKE AWAY AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH THESE CONCERNS I THINK. I'M WALKING YOU THROUGH THE REASONING THAT WE HAD AND I DEFINITELY WOULD LIKE. TO HAVE OUR WITNESSES RESPOND AS WELL. WHICH ONE. I THINK IT WOULD BE THE LARA MISTER HAGER FIRST. OKAY YES SHARKS SURE I CAN SPEAK TO THE COMMISSION'S THINKING ON THOSE- WHEN WE'RE DEVELOPING OUR PROPOSAL THE ISSUE WAS RAISED BY MISTER AT THAT TIME. WHEN WE DID DISCUSS IT AND IT WAS SENT TO THE COMMISSION THE MATH THAT THAT SENATOR MAN DESCRIBES. COUNTING THE BALLOTS IN FRONT THE CAMERAS WHATEVER CAN SEE. WHAT'S ON THE PAPER AS IT'S BEING READ BY THE INSPECTOR. WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO. THE TERM FRAUDULENT- WHICH WE GUESS BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THAT REQUIREMENT- I UNDERSTOOD COULD SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH MISSIONARY BUT SHE'S WORRIED THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE THE BALLOT EVEN ON A CAMERA BECAUSE THEY'RE- PARTICIPATING BY TELEPHONE AND I. UNDERSTAND THAT AND- THE JUDGMENT CALL THAT POINT THE COMMISSION WAS FOCUSED ON KEEPING THE BILL'S VERY NARROW. TICKETS ARE BECAUSE WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE THE PASS ON EMERGENCY BILLS ITSELF. WE WEREN'T PERSUADED AT THAT POINT THAT MORE WAS NEEDED THAT. EXCEPT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE SIDE. FRESHEN UP YEAH I THINK THE I THINK THIS OF. MISTER CHAIR I AM AND IT'S ODD HOW THE PANDEMIC IS WORKING ISN'T WHAT WE THINK WORK WHAT MY THINKING WAS IN OCTOBER IS DIFFERENT TO MY THINKING AND IN MARCH SO. I'M GOING TO JUST STAY OFF THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I GET A CHANCE TO SEE IT AGAIN AND- AS IN TO DISH JERRY IN FULL. I WANT TO SCREW UP A LITTLE BIT. AND WE'D BE HAPPY INTERACT WITH YOUR STAFF. IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COUNCIL TO SPEAK. NOW I THINK WERE I THINK WE'RE OKAY- SO- ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES. OKAY WE DO A MOTION- TO PASS TO JUDICIARY AS AMENDED I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE. ON THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK CENTERMAN FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE AND FOR CONTINUING TO WORK WITH US STAKEHOLDERS SO. WE DO HAVE THE MOTION AND WE WILL CALL A NINE I'M SORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WITH YES I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS THE RECORDING ISSUE- MY STAFF IS RAISED TO MY ATTENTION THAT THIS WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE OF THE LAW. BECAUSE HOAS RIGHT NOW ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RECORD THEIR MEETING SO I THINK THE GOAL HERE WAS AGAIN- AS A MYSTERY THERE SAID TO KEEP THIS NARROW SINCE IT'S AN URGENCY MEASURES SO WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE MASSIVE CHANGES TO LAW HERE- AND SO THAT WAS OUR REASONING BEHIND NOT REQUIRING RECORDINGS AND AGAIN THIS IS MEANT TO JUST APPLYING A VERY NARROW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS TODAY. WHEN H. AWAY CAN'T HAVE NAME EIGHT IT WORKS DIFFICULT OR PROBLEMATIC FOR NATURE WAY TO HAVE AN IN PERSON MEETING UP WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW THE CURRENT CRISIS THE PANDEMIC IS ILLUSTRATED THE NEED TO HAVE ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF MEETING- THIS IS APPLIED TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF COURSE BUT- HOAS ARE AN IMPORTANT FORM. OF GOVERNMENT AS WELL AND. AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GIVE THEM SOME. LIMITED ABILITY FIND OUT. TO IN PERSON MEETINGS. CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU AND I'LL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SB THREE NINETY ONE BY SENATOR MA'AM THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY SENATOR WIENER. AYE WIENER AYE BATES. BATES NOT BURNING CABALLERO. CABALLERO HI CORTESE AYE PARTISI AYE MCGUIRE BUT CHAU BULK HI THE TROUBLE I SKINNER HI SKINNER I AM BURKE WHAT KASKY NOBODY ELSE CAN OPERATE. FIVE OKAY BUT- HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET UP WE'RE GONNA PUT HER ON CALL FOR- ABSENT MEMBER SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MEMBERS. OKAY WE'LL NEXT GO TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB TWO NINETY. FIVE SENATORS SKINNER. ONE OF OUR. WHENEVER AUGUST THIRTY FIRST MIDNIGHT BILLS. RIGHT YEAH. REPORT DURING. FOR THE RECORD THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. SO R. S. B. TEN EIGHTY FIVE AS THE CHAIR JUST REFERENCED WAS A BILL THAT SUCCESSFULLY GOT IT ALMOST TO THE FINISH LINE LAST YEAR AND IT WAS- PASSED BY THE ASSEMBLY. BUT CONCURRENCE WITH SIXTY WELL NOT CONCURRENCE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO COME TO CENTER FOR THAT BUT WE SIXTY SEVEN FIVE VOTES IT WAS ON ITS WAY TO THE SENATE WHEN WE HIT OUR MIDNIGHT DEADLINE- SO I AM HOPEFUL THAT. WE CAN- THIS YEAR PASS THIS BILL AND WHAT SB TWO NINETY DOES. IS IT ADDRESSES CALIFORNIA'S DENSITY BONUS LAW AND MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO IT OUR DENSITY BONUS LAW IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE THE BUILDING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS WITHIN MARKET RATE. STRUCTURES MARKET RATE PROJECTS. NOW INTERESTINGLY WITH SUCH AN IMPORTANT GOOD BILL LIKE THE DENSITY BONUS BILL YOU'D BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT LESS THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THUS FAR APPROVED THE PROJECT. THAT IS TAKEN IT OF THE DENSITY BONUS BUILT IN SINCE ALMOST ALL HOUSING IN THE STATE IS IN FACT. IN OUR- PAID FOR BY PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPERS IF THEY'RE NOT UTILIZING SUCH A TOOL IS THIS IN A FAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT UTILIZING SUCH A TOOL IS THIS THEN WE ARE BUILDING LESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE NEED TO BUILD ALL HOUSING BUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADDITIONALLY. THE GOAL OF S. B. TWO NINETY IS TO CLARIFY AND IMPROVE OUR DENSITY BONUS LAW SO THAT ACTUALLY INCREASES OR RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT ARE BUILT IN OUR STATE AND ESPECIALLY WITHIN THESE MARKET RATE PROJECTS. TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY FOR FIVE FOUR RATHER DESSERTS PROVISIONS IT CONFORMS THE DENSITY BONUS APPROVAL WHICH REQUIREMENTS IN OUR EXISTING HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IT EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF FOR SALE PROJECTS BEYOND COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS SO IT INCLUDES THE IT UNITS FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. IT ADDS A PARKING WAIVER FOR SALE PROJECTS THAT ARE WITHIN A HALF A MILE OF TRANSIT IN INCLUDE AND IT. IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF THE DENSITY BONUS TO BE USED FOR STUDENT HOUSING WHICH IT CURRENTLY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE IT BECAUSE STUDENT HOUSING. IS ARE. USUALLY DESIGNED. NOT AS A IF YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE DORMITORY STYLE HOUSING WHEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUILD STUDENT HOUSING THEY MAY PUT A NUMBER OF QUOTE UNQUOTE UNITS ON THE FLOOR BUT ONLY ONE KITCHEN. AND WE NEED TO MAKE THESE ADJUSTMENTS BECAUSE THE WAY OUR USUAL CONFIGURATIONS ARE SUCH THAT A UNIT MUST BE YOU KNOW X. NUMBER OF OOMS IN THE KITCHEN AND NOT IN A DORMITORY STYLE- CONFIGURATION SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS ENABLE. A DEVELOPER TO GET UP TO ONE INCENTIVE FOR UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS BILL IF 20% OF THE UNITS ARE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WITHIN A STUDENT HOUSING CONFIGURED TYPE PROJECT- SO THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES AND I HAVE- TWO EXCELLENT WITNESSES. DAVID GARCIA FROM UC BERKELEY STANDARD TURNER CENTER AND PATRICK KENNEDY OF PANORAMIC INTERESTS AND- YOU COULD TURN TO THE WITNESSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO EACH LEAD WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES- ANSWER WILL START WITH- PATRICK KENNEDY MR COMING. CAN YOU HEAR ME RETURN. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU- SENATOR WIENER THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER- MY NAME'S PATRICK KENNEDY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING IN THE BAY AREA SINCE- NINETEEN NINETY AND- I WAS THE FIRST- DEVELOPED ACCUSE THE DENSITY BONUS IN BERKELEY IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT- THEN IN THE SPACE OF ABOUT. SEVEN YEARS I BUILT CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED APARTMENTS OF WHICH ALMOST A HUNDRED WERE SET ASIDE. FOR LOW INCOME. AS A RESULT OF THE DENSITY BONUS PROVISIONS AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DENSITY BONUS LAW THE BUILDING THOSE A HUNDRED OR SO UNITS- WE BECAME A LARGER A LANDLORD OF LOW INCOME APARTMENTS IN THE CITY OF BERKELEY HOUSING AUTHORITY AND WITH NO COST TO THE CITY. AND ALL THE UNITS STATE ON THE TAX ROLLS OF THE DENSITY BONUS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET PRIVATE DEVELOPERS TO BUILD. LOW INCOME HOUSING- I'VE ALSO USED THE HOURS ALSO- THE FIRST BALLOT PRETTY USING DENSITY BALLOTS AND SAN FRANCISCO. BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SINCE THEN I THINK ANOTHER THOUSAND OR MORE PROJECTS HAVE UTILIZED THAT SO IT'S AN EFFECTIVE INCENTIVE. THAT THAT- I THINK SHOULD BE ENHANCED IN WHATEVER WAY IT CAN ONE THING I'VE LEARNED WHEN I WAS IN BERKELEY. THIS IS THAT OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY NOW- CANNOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE LOW INCOME UNITS PROVIDED BY THE DENSITY BONUS BECAUSE THERE'S NO PROVISION TO ALLOW STUDENTS. TO RENT AN APARTMENT- IN A IN A BUILDING THAT HAVE BENEFITTED BONUS LOW INCOME UNITS AND I THINK- SENATORS SCANNERS- LEGISLATION TODAY WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN CHANGING THAT. AND ALLOWING STUDENTS TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE POTENTIAL TO BE IN SUBSIDIZED BELOW MARKET RATE UNITS. THAT ARE BUILT BY DEVELOPERS LIKE MYSELF- USING THE DENSITY BONUS SO- I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO- ADOPT SPENDER SKATERS THAT LEGISLATION PERSONALLY I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE THAN ONE INCENTIVE MAYBE TWO INCENTIVES ARE TREATED BUT NOW WE THANK YOU- I'M HAPPY TO WAIT. FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE FOR THE PRINTER REVISIONS TO IT- AND I'D LIKE TO HER G. JIM. TO APPROVE IT I'M THANK YOU MISTER KENNEDY THANK YOU- ONE ALGA DAVID. FROM THE TURNER CENTER ON THROUGH. TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU ENDED UP J. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS COURSE. IF YOU DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION HOUSING. THAT YOU KEEP WE ARE HOW RESEARCH AND CALL ORGANS THAT. AT BERKELEY FOCUSING ON ALL MATTERS OF HOUSING ISSUE FROM PLAN YOU JUNE COSTS BUILDING HAS. UP FROM EIGHTY INSTEAD OF COMING HOME TO MARKET LIKE A- BUT TODAY AND TO TESTIFY SUPPORT OF TO NINE FROM SAN SKINNER. THE IN PRINCIPLE THERE WERE. HAS SHOWN THAT THE DENSITY BY LAW THAT SHOULD BE REFORM. TO ENCOURAGE YOU GREATER. SPECIFICALLY ARE CAL RESIDENTIAL LAND SURVEY WHICH WAS OF PLANNING TO STRUCK THE STATE. ON THE FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO SEVEN. MORE THAN OF YOUR- THROUGHOUT THE DAY. REPORTED TO US TODAY HAD NO DENSITY BONUS YOU WHAT. AND EVEN IN THE CITY THAT IT. THEY HAD BEEN GOING TO SEE. MOST OF US ARE REPORT ONLY HAVE ONE. OR TWO DID YOU PARKED DURING THAT. THREE YEAR PERIOD. SO IT'S CLEAR THAT CHANGES THE DESK BONUS LAW. ARE NEEDED TO REALLY INCREASE. IT USAGE AND TO DRAWNOT TO. ONE HUNDRED OVERALL THAT ALSO SURE TO. AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE COURT NINETY TAKES IMPORTANT. TARGETED STEPS TO IMPROVE THE EAGLES OF THE UNITED. BY X. LAW HOMEOWNERS IS STUDENT HOUSING GROUP. WHICH ARE AS YOU KNOW CRITICALLY IN NEED. THESE ARE SIMPLE. TRICK PART OF THAT COULD HELP IN MODEL TOWARD USING THE UNITED.

HOUSING PACKAGE AND I'M HONORED THAT SENATOR ATKINS HAS SIGNED ON AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF ISSUE TIME I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. THIS LEGISLATION INCENTIVIZES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. OUGHT TO CONCENTRATE ON NEW HOUSING MULTI UNIT HOUSING AND- INFILL- AND JOB IN TRANSIT RICH OUR COMMUNITIES. BY GIVING SEE WHAT RELIEF TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DECISION TO ADOPT- A NEW ZONING FOR UP TO TEN UNITS IN NON SEVERAL AREAS. TO BE CLEAR SENATE BILL TEN IS A PURE LOCAL CONTROL BILL. THAT PROVIDES CITIES IN CALIFORNIA WITH A VOLUNTARY- AND AFFECT VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE TO USE. OR NOT USE- TO ENGAGE AN. MORE EXPEDITIOUS REZONING. IT FOR CITY TO NOT TO USE OUR SPEED IT WILL THAT HAVE NO IN ON THAT CITY. DIVERSITY DECIDES THAT A FEW TIMES APPROPRIATE THE CITY CAN OFTEN AND USE THIS TOOL TO MORE EFFECTIVELY ON STONE- IT'S COMMUNITY AND DECIDE ON WHERE AND HOW AND WHETHER TO DO IT TEN UNITS OR UNITS ARE FOUR UNITS OR ANYTHING ELSE- THERE IS A- TIMES. I THINK. CITIES GET BROAD BRUSHED. AS A NEW CITIES EVER WANTING TO INCREASE. ZONES DENSITY- AND WHILE THERE ARE CITIES CERTAINLY PLAYED CITIES THAT DO NOT WANT TO THERE ARE ALSO PLENTY OF CITIES. TWO ONE TWO ZERO ONE FOR MORE HOUSING. BUT WE MAKE IT INCREDIBLY HARD FOR THEM TO DO SO AND WE MAKE THEM SOMETIMES EVEN AFFAIRS OWNING. IN A VERY ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE WAY YOUR JOBS YOUR TRANSIT AND EXISTING INFILL AREAS. WE MAKE THEM GO THROUGH A VERY VERY LENGTHY. PROCESS SB TEN ALLOW CITIES TO STREAMLINE REZONING FOR UP TO TEN UNIT. BUILDINGS IF THEY CHOOSE. THE BILL. ONLY APPLIES TO YOUR TRANSIT AND JOB RICH AREAS OR URBAN AND SELF- ON THE BILL REALLY HAS POTENTIAL TO EMPOWER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PURSUE MORE EQUITABLE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE USE OF THIS MISSING MIDDLE ARE KIND OF HOUSING- I WANT TO BE. CLEAR THAT SB TEN DOES NOT CHANGE HOW INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. ARE APPROVED- THIS IS ABOUT THE ZONING EACH PROJECT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER THE NORMAL APPROVAL PROCESS IS GOVERNED BY EITHER LOCAL OR STATE LAW.

FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THEM IF YOU HAVE VANTAGE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH READING CHAIR VENTURE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TO RETURN THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT THE CENTER WIENER DIMANA JUST ON THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE. ON SB TEN LAST YEAR YOU WORKED ON ENSURING THAT THIS BILL IS FOCUSED BOTH ON AFFORDABLE AS WELL AS MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT IF YOU COULD JUST PLEASE CLARIFY THAT THAT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. R. SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN SENATE MCGUIRE- THIS BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAND THIS BILL IS ABOUT SMALL BUILDINGS. TWO THREE FOUR SIX EIGHT UP TO TEN UNIT- BUILDINGS- IF- AND THOSE CAN BE EITHER BELOW MARKET RATE WILL RECALL AFFORDABLE OR MARKET RATE OR A MIX OF THE TWO- IN ADDITION ANY- ANY LOCAL. INCLUSIONARY OF THE CITY HAS ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS THAT CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF UNITS HAVE TO BE AFFORDABLE TO A CERTAIN INCOME BRACKET THAT WOULD APPLY TO THIS BILL THIS BILL DOES NOT. CHANGE LOCAL AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS LOCAL LOCAL HEIGHT LIMITS LOCAL SETBACKS ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS BILL DIFFERS TO LOCAL DECISIONS THIS IS A LOCAL DECISION MAKING. THE BILL BUT THE BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY PREVENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM BEING BUILT PURSUANT TO AN S. B. TIME. REZONING BENCHERS ONE ISSUE QUESTION. GO AHEAD I THOUGHT YOU WANTED THANK YOU SO MUCH FURNITURE YEAH AND THEN FOR THE AUTHOR- CENTER WIENER THE OTHER ISSUE IS ON THE VOLUNTARY WITH THIS IS PROVIDING FOR EXAMPLE CITY COUNCILS A TOOL TO BE ABLE TO USE IT'S NOT MANDATORY BUT IF THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS. THEY COULD UTILIZE THIS IN YOUR COMMUNITY BUT IT WOULD BE UP TO THAT COUNCIL CORRECT CORRECT THIS IS A PURELY VOLUNTARY TOOL CITY CAN IGNORE ENTIRELY AND THEN IT HAS NO EFFECT AT ALL IN THAT CITY- OR THE CITY COUNCIL CAN DECIDE TO UTILIZE- I THINK THEY'RE ONE OF THE THINGS WE- PLACE REQUIREMENTS ON CITIES AROUND HOUSING AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT HOUSING IS A- IMPORTANT STATEWIDE ISSUE AND- THERE NEED TO BE STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR PRODUCTION OF HOUSING- BUT WE ALSO. SOMETIMES MAKE IT HARD ON CITIES WE DID THAT WE TOOK REDEVELOPMENT AWAY FOR EXAMPLE NONE AND WE TELL CITIES WE WANT THEM TO REZONE FOR MORE HOUSING IN SUSTAINABLE AREAS BUT THEN WE MAKE A REALLY LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO THAT AS THE TIME IS GIVING US VOLUNTARY TOOL FOR CITIES IF THEY CHOOSE TO USE THAT. TO HAVE A FASTER- AND- MORE- COST EFFECTIVE. WAY OF DOING IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN THAT SAID THERE'S SOME. ABOUT THAT AS HAVE HAVE BEEN IN. NEEDS THAT. CITY WOULD HAVE TO BE ADOPTED THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TURN THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU. THAT IS WHY CASTING. I'M SORRY STEPPED OUT. THERE WAS ONE CALLER ONE OF THE IN. THE UNITED NEIGHBORHOOD- PEOPLE THAT INDICATED THAT. THIS WORK SALARY. DEVELOPMENT IN HIGH FIRE ZONES A FIRE SINCE CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT OR YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE BILL DOES YEAH I'M SORRY. AS I DO IN THEM. PRINT ALL MY HOUSING BILLS- I EXCLUDE AND SECLUDED HERE THE- SO CALLED VERY HIGH. FIRE ONE OF OUR SEVERITIES ARE INSIDE THE HIGHEST TIER. OF WILDFIRE SEVERITY. IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BILL AND THAT. IS THE SAME PROVISIONAL WE HAVE HAD IN VARIOUS- IN OTHER SENATE. BILLS AS WELL- THERE IS A- A PROVISION IN IT THAT IF THE FIRE MARSHAL. CERTIFIES THAT A CERTAIN AREA BASICALLY HAS THE SUPPLIERS SEVERITY RISK HAS BEEN. REDUCED THEN THEY CAN DO THAT BUT THE FIRE MARSHAL- HOUSE TO CERTIFY THAT OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T BUILDING THOSE ARMS. THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER SENATE HOUSING BILLS IN TERMS OF HOW. WE FRAME THAT EXEMPTION. WHAT. OH I'M SORRY SKINNER IF. YEAH HE WAS FINISHED SENATOR SKINNER SORRY WE WERE FINISHED CRAP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ARM. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE BILL- FIVE THE OPPOSITION THAT CALLED IN WE CLEARLY KNOW THAT THERE ARE RESIDENTS IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO- ARE. VERY VERY RESISTANT TO ZONING CHANGES. BUT I WANT TO NOTE THAT. A GOOD REASON OR IT COULD BE. A LARGE PART OF WHY WE HAVE SUCH A HOUSING SUPPLY SHORTAGE IS BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF LAND WITHIN OUR URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS THAT ARE. ZONED SINGLE FAMILY AND ONLY SINGLE FAMILY AND AS A RESULT WE'VE RESTRICTED THOSE RESTRICTIONS HAVE LEFT SUCH LITTLE WAY ON ESPECIALLY IN OUR JOB RICH AREAS AND TRANSIT AREAS AS THIS BILL PUTS OUT. TO BE- MULTI FAMILY OF ANY SIZE. AND WE HAVE GROWN IN JOBS IN GROWN IN POPULATION THAT WE HAVE THIS TERRIBLE HOUSING SHORTAGE IT ISN'T THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD INVESTORS WILLING TO BUILD HOUSING IT ISN'T FOR THEIR SO MANY OTHER REASONS WE'VE HAD LOTS OF DESIRE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUY HOUSING WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE- WHO NOT PAY AS MUCH. FOR THE HOUSING THAT THEY HAVE AND THIS SHORTAGE HAS CREATED ALSO ARE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY REASONABLE MEASURE BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES. THAT VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE OF ENABLING OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO SO CHOOSE TO BE ABLE TO REZONE SOME OF THOSE PARCELS IF THEY ARE IN THESE TYPES OF AREAS. NOW I AM. I WAS- IT'S HARD TO HEAR ARE GOOD COLLEAGUES IN THE BUILDING TRADES SO- UNANIMOUSLY OPPOSE THE BILL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WAS DISCUSSION AND THERE WERE SOME- PROVISIONS THAT WOULD- HAVE THEM BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL BUT EVEN WITH THOSE PROVISIONS THEY HAVE CHOSEN NOW TO OPPOSE AND I HOPETHAT WE CAN GET TO A GOOD MEETING OF THE MINDS HOWEVER I THINK THIS IS STILL A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. CENTER SENATOR WHICH'LL BOOK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR IF I MAY YEAH. I RECEIVED A LOT OF LETTERS OF CONCERN WITH THIS BILL FROM COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS- AND MOST OF WHAT I SEE THE UNDERLYING THEME IS THE FEAR OF THE- LOSING THE INTEGRITY OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES SPECIALLY RESIDENTIAL AREAS. WOULD YOU CLARIFY I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW FIRST OF ALL I WOULD RECOMMEND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE- AUTHORIZING NOT MANDATING OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS I THINK THAT IS THAT IS COMMENDABLE AND RESPECTABLE. ON THE FIRST CALIFORNIA BECAUSE COMING FROM MY AREA I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE LACK OF HOUSING PERIOD IS HUGE. AND SO ON THAT END AND APPRECIATE LOCAL CONTROL APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU ACCOMMODATED THAT. INDEED- IN THIS BILL- WITH REGARDS THE CONSTRUCTION WOULD YOU BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS URBAN AND WHAT IS- SUBURBAN AND RURAL WOULD YOU. BE ABLE TO DEFINE AS TO WHEN YOU IN THIS BILL WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY. URBAN INFILL SO THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT IT AFFECTS THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR URBAN INTO THEIR THEIR ARCHES A SPECIFIC DEFINITION I AM LONG WE ARE SUCH AS A IT TOOK TO FIND. FREEZE AND I CAN. PULL IT UP BUT IT'S BEEN USED IN OTHER CONTEXTS TO BOND AND IT'S BASICALLY- AREAS WHERE IT IS LIKE. ARE LIKE WELL DEVELOPED AND IT'S NOT. OPEN SPACE AND- IT'S NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF LIKE A WILDERNESS AREA- IT'S LIKE AREAS WHERE IT'S LIKE A LIKE A COMPACT. COMMUNITY THAT IS LIKE. I HATE THE PHRASE BUILT. BUT ARE LEAST TO AN EXTENT BUILT OUT- BUT IT'S NOT JUST LIKE. AREAS WHERE IT'S RANDOM NOT RAMBLE LIKE HOMES SPORADICALLY EVERY NOW AND AGAIN I WANT TO BE A MORE RURAL SETTINGS- SO ARE THERE SOME SUBURBS THAT WOULD. NOT QUALIFY AS AN BUILDER SOME SUBURBS OF WOMEN'S BECAUSE OUR TO. SPREAD OUT FOR EACH OTHER AND THE GOAL IS TO SAY YOU'RE GONNA. EMPHASIZE MORE HOUSING LET'S DO IT WHERE THERE'S ALREADY. OTHER HOUSING BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE IN CALIFORNIA- DIFFERENT SO MUCH OPPOSITION TO BUILDING IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING. WITH HIS BILL TO FURTHER FURTHER AL AND IT JUST CREATES- PROBLEMS WITH YOU KNOW COVERING UP FARMLAND AND- A LONGER COMMUTES AND SO WE'RE TRYING T MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE GIVEN THE TOOL TO MAKE IT MORE CONTACT WE DON'T WANT TO. HAVE SEX WITH STREAMLINING FOR. BUILDING FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT SO IT'S REALLY CONTACT COMMUNITIES SO WOULD THIS APPLY TO HOME OR RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE PER SE. YOU HAVE A RESIDENTIAL AREA THAT ARE A COMMUNITY THAT ENCOMPASSES AN AREA OR A LOT SIZES OF. SAY SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED- FEET. BAKER IT COULD NOT IT'S NOT BASED ON LOTS OF IT'S BASED ON THE ARRAIGN OF DEVELOPMENTS- AND WE CAN GET YOU THE EXACT DEFINITION OF A PERMANENT PHONE TRYING TO LOOK IT UP RIGHT NOW- IT'S ON ARE. EVER RAISE YOUR FIVE. BUT IT'S BASICALLY THE U. S. CENSUS ACTUALLY DEFINES WHAT INFILL IS- IT'S A- IT'S CALLED URBANIZED AREA OR AND URBAN CLUSTER SO HAS TO BE SORT OF CLUSTERED AGAIN NOT SORT OF SPREAD OUT- IN ADDITION SO IT'S ONE OF THE CLIMB BY THE CENSUS AND OTHER ONE IS A SITE IN WHICH WILL BE 75% OF THE PERIMETER OF THE SITE THE JOINS OTHER PARCELS RIGHT SO IT'S NOT JUST LIKE BY ITSELF. HAS TO BE A LOT AROUND OTHER PARCELS- AND- A MATTER ALSO SO AS OWN PEROT. USE OR RESIDENTIAL MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATION THAT ALLOWS RESIDENTS FOR USE OR A MIX OF RESIDENTIAL. AND NON RESIDENTIAL OUR WORLD THESE TWO THIRDS OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE HAS TO BE FOR RESIDENTIAL. FOR THEIR ALL AREAS WERE LIKE AN AREA OF WORK WHERE WE ARE BURGER COMMUNITIES HAVE PLANS. FOR HOUSING AND FOR THAT KIND OF CONTINUOUS. KIND OF HOUSING- SO THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS A COUNTY UNTIL- AND THAT IS OUR RIGHT AT THE END OF THE BILL IS WERE URBAN INFILL- IS TO FIND. OKAY AND I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE. IN NOT IT'S NOT MANDATED AND THAT ARE AT THE LOCAL PLANNING. COMMISSION STILL HAVE JURISDICTION OVER- THEIR LOCAL PLANNING AND ZONING. SO THE BILL A COUPLE THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN UNDER FIRST CITY COUNCIL HAS TO DECIDE OFTEN. THAT THE CITY COUNCIL DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE BILL OR NOR IS IT ARE PROJECTS OF HUNDRED OR JUST DECIDE NOT DOING THAT. THE NOTHING HAPPENS THE BILL IS NO OBLIGATION- CITY. IF THE CITY COUNCIL OPTION THE CITY COUNCIL THEN- AS A CURRENTLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF APPROVAL PROCESS THERE WILL BE A COULD BE A FULL. DISCRETIONARY PROCESS AND SEE WHAT IT COULD BE A MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS. AND THEN ONCE THAT HAPPENS EACH AND EVERY PROJECT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER. APPROVAL PROCESS. YOU THE CITY HAS UP OR AND NOW STATE. WHATEVER THE GOVERNING LAW LOCAL STATE LAW IS FOR APPROVAL WOULD APPLY TO EACH OF THOSE PROJECTS WITH THIS BILL DOES NOT. CHANGE WHAT THE APPROVAL PROCESS WOULD BE THAT'S WHATEVER THE CURRENT GOVERNING LAW AS- WHICH CLARIFIES WHETHER OR NOT. INDIVIDUALS OR COMMUNITY MEMBERS STILL HAVE A VOICE TO COME IN AND GIVE THEIR VOICE TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RIGHT TODAY- COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL HAVE A VOICE FIRST WHEN THIS IS BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A VOICE. HI THERE AND THEN BE EITHER HAPPY OR UNHAPPY WITH CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS OVER THE VOTE- AND THEN EACH INDIVIDUAL PROJECT. WHATEVER THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS NOT SOME CITIES HAVE. A MINISTERIAL STREAMLINED APPROVAL PROCESS AND NOT SIX DECISION THAT THE CITY HAS MADE THERE ARE SOME STATE LAWS THAT. CAN REQUIRE THAT BUT- WHATEVER YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE PROCESS IS. FINE IF IT'S A DISCRETIONARY PROCESS APPROVAL PROCESS WHICH A LOT OF CITIES HAVE. BEEN PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE FULLY I AM NOT PROCESS PERFECT SO THIS ACCOMMODATES THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT DOING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHERE IT KNOWLEDGE IN THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL ENTITY. COMMUNITY IS UNIQUE. ABOUT THAT THAT'S CORRECT BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO CITY NOT ONLY DO CITIES GET TO DECIDE. WHETHER THEY OPT IN OR OPT OR OPT OUT AT ALL- ON THE DAY. IF THEY OPT IN. VEGAS TO DECIDE. WHERE INNER CITY. BAKER SO THEY HAVE LOTS OF ENTIRE CITY IS CONSIDERED AN FELT. BIGGER SAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO THIS ON THIS ONE STREET. OR ONE NEIGHBORHOOD. FOUR ONE HALF OF THE CITY OR THE WHOLE CITY WHATEVER THE WHATEVER THEY DECIDED TO DO- NO ONE WOULD BE TELLING THEM. BUT HELL TO DO A CITY WOULD BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH ITS OWN VERSION OF IT THAT YOU NEED TO THAT. OUR CITY AND IN THE CITY- COULD DECIDE WE WANTED TO BE A STREAMLINED MINISTERIAL APPROVAL WE WANT TO BE DISCRETIONARY YOU KNOW UNLESS STATE LAW. DICTATES ONE OR THE OTHER- AND THEN SO I THINK THIS WILL IT WOULD LOOK. PROBABLY FOR VERY DIFFERENT AND EVERY CITY THAT DID IT. BECAUSE DIFFERENT CITIES ARE GOING TO PICK AND CHOOSE. WHERE WHERE TO DO IT. OKAY PERFECT AND THEN THE LAST- CONCERNED. THIS IS NOT OVER RIGHT ANY. ANY- ANY CODE THAT COMES FROM CONSTRUCTION CODE- GOVERNMENTAL CODE- LABOR CODES- ANY OF THAT THE ONLY THING IS THAT THE MAKING A CHANGES IS A SAYS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A C. QUITE YEAH I OUR STREAMS LINES IT MAKES IT LESS COSTLY FOR THE ZONING- THAT DOTS THE DOTS REALLY THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BILL- HI. IN TERMS OF LAWN LABOR NO IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING- WITH LABOR AND I JUST WANNA KNOWLEDGE- YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH WITH THE BILL INSURANCE FOR MANY YEARS ON HOUSING AND HAVE PUT LABOR PROTECTIONS AND BILLS BEFORE AND I'VE HAD MAJOR HOUSING BILLS THAT THE BUILDING TRADES HAVE. STRONG SUPPORTED- ON ON THIS BILL WE AS CENTER SKNNER MENTIONED WE DID WORK WITH THE BUILDING TRADES LAST YEAR WE AGREED ON AMENDMENT THAT WOULD RESULT IN THEM BEING NEUTRAL IN THE BILL THAT ONE AND THAT EXACT LANGUAGE WENT INTO THE READ REINTRODUCTION OF THE BILL THIS YEAR SB TIME BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT VERSION LAST YEAR- AND- I JUST WANNA LET YOU LIVE OUT HOLDS I MEAN WE STILL HAVE PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO. WORK IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT SO FAR THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT THAT WAS L. STANDARD I MEAN THE WORKPLACE SAFETY PROTECTIONS ARE OFTEN A DOZEN CHANGES AT ALL THAT DOES IT YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE HAVE A- CONVERSATION ABOUT ABOUT WAGES AND I'M NOT AS CONCERNED WE WORKED WITH THE TRADE ON OVER THE YEARS- BUT THESE ARE BECAUSE THERE'S A SMALLER PROJECT WE TYPICALLY HAVE NOT PUT THOSE WAGE REQUIREMENTS AND- FOR PROJECTS TEN UNDER. AT THAT IS THAT A LATER START ANYWAY BUT I APPRECIATE THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A PLACE BUT THAT'S NOT A CONVERSATION FOR THIS TYPE OF BAIL- YOU KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS COVERED AT A LATER TIME BUT- I DO APPRECIATE THAT- BUT THINK I THINK. IT I ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE AT WORK COMMENT ICON THREAD IN MOST OF THE- CAN THAT I HAD SAID YOU VERY. FOR YOUR FOR YOUR BILL AND BRING SPORT CENTER FOR YOUR- I DO HAVE A QUESTION A SENATOR WIENER- IT DOES SAY IN IN THE ACTUAL ANALYSIS HERE ON. OF THE NEW BILL THAT IT'S- TRANSIT RICH AREA JOBS RICH AREA OR ND URBAN FIGHT AND URBAN INFILL SITE PROBABLY MAKES MORE SENSE BUT WHEN WE REACH OUT TO SUBURBIA. ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA THAT I LIVE THERE'S A CONCERN THAT THIS BILL- IF YOU COMBINE IT WITH THE DENSITY BONUS- YOU'RE LOOKING OUT SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY DENSIFICATION IN A NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS IF YOU HAVE AREAS WHERE THERE'S A VACANT LOTS AND WE DO HAVE THAT. IN A NUMBER OF MY COMMUNITY SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS SIMPLY HOW IT IS THIS INTERFACE WITH THE DENSITY BONUS LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED SOME YARD IN THIS SESSION AND SOME OF THE PAST SESSIONS IF THE DEVELOPER CAME IN AND WANTED TO DO. YOU KNOW THE TEN UNITS THROUGHOUT THE CITY TO AGREE TO THAT BUT ALSO WANTED TO APPLY DENSITY BONUS- YES AND YOU'RE RIGHT THE IN ADDITION TO AN INFILL IT'S- THE HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT AREA AND- JOB RICHER. FUNDS SO THE A DEVELOPER COULD BY DENSITY BONUS- TO THIS PRODUCT JUST LIKE ANY. MULTI UNIT PROJECT TYPICALLY SMALL MULTI UNIT DON'T NECESSARILY PENCIL WELL FOR DENSITY BONUS SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN SCALE TYPICALLY- SO YOU NORMALLY I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU WOULD EVER SEE A DENSITY BONUS TRIGGERED ON A LIKE A FOUR OR FIVE UNIT BUILDING. MAYBE SOMEONE HAS DONE IT AT SOME POINT BUT THAT'S PRETTY RARE- BUT A CITY COULD- COULD AT LEAST IN PART COMPENSATE FOR THAT THIS DOESN'T REQUIRE THE CITY TO GO UP TO TEN UNITS. RATED TEN TEN IS THE MAXIMUM THE CITY COULD YOU JUST BE TIME ZONE FOR FOUR UNITS ARE FIVE UNITS ARE THREE UNITS OR SEVEN OR TEN OR WHATEVER THEY WANT. SO IF A CITY IS CONCERNED OVER GOING TO OVERTIME AND THEN THE DENSITY BONUS COULD TAKE YOU UP TO THIRTEEN UNITS OR SOMETHING THE CITY BANK RECAP AT SIX OR SEVEN TO COMPETENT TO THE CITY WOULD. WE TRY TO PROVIDE FEXIBILITY FOR THE CITY'S TO ENVISION WHAT THIS WILL ULTIMATELY. LOOK LIKE A MAN AND AGAIN THE WHOLE ALL HERE. IS TO MAKE CITY LIVES EASIER. SO THEY CAN CHIU- THEIR OWN DESK IN THIS. WHEN FORCE THEM TO DO IT. BUT I THINK THAT'S OF SIMPLY. GOOD COMPONENT OF THIS BUT I DO. RAISE MY USUAL CONCERN IS WHEN YOU START DOING GASIFICATION. AND YOU TAKE AWAY- HIS SPECIALLY IN THE AREAS LET'S SAY THEY'RE TRANSIT RICH. UP IRVINE IS A GREAT. EXAMPLE OF TRANSIT RICH IS A JOBCENTRE BUT IS VERY RESIDENTIAL AND YOU WOULD BE ELIMINATING- REQUIREMENT FOR PARKING. AND I'D LIKE TO TRAVEL FROM OF THOSE AREAS AND SEE WHAT THAT HAS DONE ALL THE PARKING OF ALL OVER THE STREETS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN UNIVERSITY TOWNS LEVINE AGAIN. OF THE DAY ARE DOUBLING UP IN THESE UNITS BECAUSE IT'S VERY AFFORDABLE BUT THEY ALL HAVE CARS. YOU FIVE HARDLY FIND OF KIDS IN THAT AREA- THAT AGE THAT DON'T BECAUSE- YOU NEED THEM. SO THAT REMAINS MY MAJOR CONCERN WITH THE DENSIFICATION ALL THAT IS TAKEN PLACE AND YOU KNOW OUR HOUSING- THEORY HERE AND WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND I THINK YOU HEARD ME MANY TIMES I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. BECAUSE IN MY CITY WE'VE LOST LIVES OF CHILLED CHILDREN OF HAVE. LOST THEIR LIVES GOING. IN THESE AREAS WHERE IF. YOU KNOW CONDOMINIUMS- AND SOME APARTMENTAREAS GOING THROUGH- YOU KNOW PARK CARS HERE AND THEY'RE EVERYWHERE AND THEY HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES SO. I'M GONNA STICK WITH THAT BUT I DO- SAY THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT. VOLUNTARY BECAUSE I THINK OUR CITY COUNCILS ON THE BIG ADVOCATE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I THINK THEY DO A GOOD JOB. IN TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING TO BE. IN A RIGHT FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES FEIST RIGHT AND CERTAINLY LOCATION RIGHT. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF AREA AND HERE THAT- THE AUDIENCE DISCRETIONARY ONCE YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO A DENSITY BONUS AND WE'RE REQUIRED TO YOU COULD HAVE A TEN UNIT THING AND NOW. THEY WANT TO PUT FOR UNITS. IN ADDITION THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND ANY MEDIA REALLY OPENS UP THE TO DO. BY AND ALL THE OTHER SO I WILL BE A- TO THE BUT I KNOW THAT YOU. VERY HARD ON THE PHONE. WE AND I KNOW THAT. YOU HAVE CASH THAT EQUALS UP THEIR SIDE. THE WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS IT THAT TOUGH KNOWING ALL WE HAVE A TIME ISSUE HERE AND- ESPECIALLY WITH FOR YOUR NEXT BILL. I JUST THINK IF THERE'S NO OTHER. COMMENTS UNLESS YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. I KNOW I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THAT  THINK ARE I THINK I'LL TAKE THAT AS MY CLOTHES I RESPECTFULLY ASK. OFFER I WILL. IS THAT IS THAT YOU WOULD. YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR CLOTHES SUCH A CLOSE. OKAY MAN. WILL THE ROLL. DID WE HAVE A MOTION. SORRY WE HAVE A MOTION OR DID WE HAVE A MOTION I THOUGHT WE HAD EARLIER MOTION BUT- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. I'M ABOUT THE MOVE IN MOVE BY SENATOR CAFIERO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL TEN BY SENATOR WIENER THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SENATOR WIENER AYE WIENER AYE BATES NO BATES NO CABALLERO. CABALLERO AYE CORTESE AYE CORTESE AYE MCGUIRE MCGUIRE AYE THE TROUBLE HI THE CHERNOBYL HI SKINNER. SKINNER I AM BURKE BUT CASKEY HI TELESCOPII. SEVEN ONE THAT BILLS OUT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. WE WILL NOW MOVES TO THE SENATE BILL FOR SEVENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR WIENER- PLEASE PRESENT YOUR REALTOR JULIA. FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANABADI SIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES ON THE SP FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN IS THAT- CALIFORNIA HOUSING DATA ACT. CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED A NUMBER OF HOUSING LAWS IN RECENT YEARS TO HELP ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY- DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE LAWS IS SPORADIC AT BEST AND QUITE LIMITED. AND SO THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE STRUGGLE TO ACTUALLY QUANTIFY. EXACTLY HOW EFFECTIVE THESE LAWS ARE HOW THEY'RE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN FRANK ABOUT THE TO IS IMPORTANT. PEOPLE WHO ARE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEBATE. IN TERMS OF ASSESSING IS THIS LOG DOING WHAT WE INTENDED. IT TO DOING MORE THAN WE INTENDED AS A LESSON WERE INTENDED EFFECT CREATING- UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR IS IT HITTING THE NAIL RIGHT ON THE HEAD- WE REALLY HAVE TROUBLE DOING THAT EVALUATION WE HAVEN'T FOR SOME. LAWS BUT NOT FOR OTHERS. SB FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN EXPANDS CALIFORNIA'S DATA COLLECTION REGARDING- THE IMPACTS AND EFFECTIVENESS OR LACK THEREOF OF STATE HOUSING LAWS- IT'S IMPORTANT TO STRENGTHEN OUR HOUSING DATA COLLECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC AND POLICY MAKERS. I CAN HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING- SO. THIS WILL ALSO BE HELPFUL FOR STATE AGENCIES FOR RESEARCHERS FOR ADVOCATES FOR OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- TO BE ABLE TO. ADVOCATE AND TO ADVISE US ON CHANGES IN HOUSING LAW- SB FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY ADDING A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS TO THE ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT KNOWN AS THE APR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO HUD EACH YEAR. AND RELATIONS ARE HOUSING ELEMENTS JUST TO BE CLEAR CITIES ALREADY HAVE TO PROVIDE THIS ANNUAL REPORT- IN THE ASSEMBLY ODDS OF SOME ADDITIONAL DATA THAT THEY PROVIDE- WITH A REPORT- FIVE SO FOR EXAMPLE- IT WILL REQUIRE- THAT CITIES BY THE LOCATION AND TOTAL NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTS APPROVED BUILDING PERMITS ISSUED- UNITS CONSTRUCTED- PURSUANT TO STREAMLINING REQUIREMENTS- ARE FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. PROJECT ROOM KEY AND SO FORTH- IN. A CITIES WANT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT MITIGATION FEES OWNING ORDINANCES AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS WHICH ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO REPORT UNDER PREVIOUS LAW- SO COLLEAGUES THIS IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT LAW IT'LL HELP US MAKE BETTER DECISIONS. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL SB FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN- WITH ME IN SPIRIT.

I MEAN SKEWS ME FEDERAL I GOT FEE FROM AMONG PAGE SEVEN OF THE STAFF REPORT AND WITH LIST OUT A THROUGH G. THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE RICH- AS PART OF THE ANNUAL. PROGRESS REPORT EVERITT NO PROBLEMS WOULD. BE THROUGH G. I WAS- HAPPY TO HEAR YOUR YOUR- PROPONENTS SAY THAT THIS IS A LIGHT TOUCH BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED WHEN I READ THROUGH IT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE. A FULL EMPLOYMENT ACT FOR TITLE SEARCHES ON ALL THE DIFFERENT PARCELS IN A CITY THAT MAY HAVE THE RESTRICTION WHETHER IT WAS A LAGUNA. THE GAL OR SAN JOSE OR SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE IT WAS THE ANNEX BIG SECTION OR THE EVERY REQUIREMENTS AND EACH PARCEL BY THE CITY OR THE COUNTY TO SPECIAL DISTRICT- THAT YOU KNOW ONCE UPON A TIME YOU DIDN'T HAVE CATTLE RAISING OR YOU COULDN'T DO THIS THERE WERE SOME PRO PROHIBITIONS THAT WERE PUT IN LONG LONG AGO- SO THAT WAS ONE QUESTION AND THEN. IF WE'RE ALREADY SENDING ANNUAL REPORTS DEFICIENT AB MAYBE OR IN AND THAT INCOMPLETE. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT YOU SEND THE CURRENT ONE IN THE FINAL THE FIVE LAST ONES ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT THE THIS IS CURRENT IN FIVE PREVIOUS ANNUAL REPORTS WOULD THAT BE AMENDED REPORTS FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS SO THAT WASN'T CLEAR IF YOU COULD. COMMENT CIRCLE THIRTY SEVEN ON THE GIRL LIKE AND SEARCH. TITLES THIS IS ABOUT. ACTIONS OF THE CITIES ARE TAKING OR NOT TAKING ON PROJECTS WHAT YOU KNOW WITH A CERTAIN SECTION ARE INVOKING HER. IF THEY'RE REJECTING OR ACCEPTING SB THIRTY FIVE APPLICATIONS THINGS LIKE THAT- AND IN TERMS OF NO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RETROACTIVELY CHANGE OUR PREVIOUS APR IS. THIS IS FOR GOING FORWARD THEY HAVE TO ADD. ADDITIONAL MATERIAL. YES- I WOULD JUST SAY MICHAEL IN-AGAIN WHAT WAS FOR. IT HAS BURST- THERE'S A COMMITMENT FOR NOTICES NOTES THERE. IS AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE TWENTY NINETY WAS ALREADY SIGNED INTO LAW WHICH HAS REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT WERE SEEN AS A BEST PRACTICE MAJOR ADDICTIONS AND CRADLE LANDING. PAGES ON A WEBSITE WHERE THEY'RE CLEAN THAT INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED BREAKING FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND I WOULD SEE WHERE THEY WOULD JUST PROVIDE A LINK TAKES YOU TO CONFIRM THAT THEIR- CALIFORNIA STATE LAW AND THEN THAT LOOK AT THOSE AND THEN WE HAVE A CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE INFORMATION AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR EVERYONE TO SEE. INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO TO CHURCH JURISDICTION WEBSITE NEXT CITY ALSO THE MASTER LIST WITH LINKS. ARE SMART BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE POSING A BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S SOME NEFARIOUS EFFORT TO DO SOMETHING I MEAN THIS IS. ITS DATA AND DATA CAN BE HELPFUL OR HARMFUL TO ANY POINT OF VIEW BRADLEY THERE COULD YOU COULD AS A TO THE RESIDENTS YOU WANT TO KNOW. WHAT IS MY CITY COUNCIL OR PLANNING DEPARTMENT DOING FOR PERMITS. BUT YOU MIGHT BE SOMEBODY WANT TO SEE A TIME MORE HOUSING SO YOU'RE I'M HAPPY THAT THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT IS ACTING A CERTAIN WAY. YOU COULD BE SOMEONE WHO'S CONCERNED ABOUT MORE HOUSING IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND YOU WANT TO TRANSPARENCY. TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THE DATA IS LIMITED. JUST READ OF A CAN. HAVE TO GO THROUGH A I DON'T EVEN. HOW THEY WERE. GET A LIST. THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DO HAND SEARCHES. WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR EVERYONE WHATEVER THEIR POINT OF VIEW IT'S- AN IDEA. MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD THAT THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE NEXUS STUDIES THAT MAYBE YOU NEVER SEND IT TO H. E. D. D. OF ANNEX A STUDY ON YOUR IMPACT FEES THAT YOU COMPLETED. IT THREE YEARS AGO AND SOMEHOW HCD DOESN'T HAVE IT. THIS NOW WOULD MAKE THAT REQUIREMENT THAT THEY GET THAT DATA. AND HOPEFULLY. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE WOULD HAVE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR WEBSITE TOO SO THAT. THE CITIZENS OF AND I KNOW HE'S GOING TO READ IT BUT- OKAY. THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS IS A REMOTE OR THE NATURE. OF A HERO. THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM HAIR I. HAVE A COMMENT. AND THEN I'M READY TO MOVE THE BILL IF IT'S- APPROPRIATE- I REALLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND- I'M ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THIS KIND OF INFORMATION FROM CITIES UNLESS YOU. YOU YOU ASK FOR IT DIRECTLY. AND EVEN THEN IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET- THIS WOULD REQUIRE THE CITY TO PREPARE A DOCUMENT THAT WOULD GO TO EACH CD. IN WHICH CASE THE CITIZENS WOULD GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THAT IS PART OF THE CITY COUNCIL PACKET SO IT'S REALLY. A SUNSHINE TYPE OF. A BILL THAT WILL GIVE. THE LOCAL RESIDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WITH CITY COUNCILS ARE DOING AS WELL SO- I LIKE THE BILL I LIKE THE- THE DATA THAT IT'S GOING TO BE PRODUCING AND SO I MOVED BUT- WE MOVE THE BILL. FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THEN WE DO HAVE A MOTION. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR WIENER.
