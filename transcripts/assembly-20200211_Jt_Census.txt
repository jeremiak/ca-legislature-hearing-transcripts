AS WE LAUNCHED AND THE- NEXT THIRTY DAYS WELL ACTUALLY I'VE ON APRIL FIRST BUT WE PEOPLE BE GETTING STUFF. THE CENSUS WHICH IS MANDATED BY THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED EVERY TEN YEARS SINCE SEVENTEEN NINETY. AND SIX TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE AND COMPLETE COUNT OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. CENSUS DATA AS USE NATIONALLY TO PORTION SEATS FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND TO DISTRIBUTE BILLIONS. OF FEDERAL FUNDING. AND WHILE THE CENSUS IS CONDUCTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS LAUNCHED MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO ENSURE AN ACCURATE AND COMPLETE COUNT. IN OUR OWN STATE. ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE FOR TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS TO ADVISE AND ASSIST THE STATE CENSUS OFFICES OUT REACH OPERATION. AND THIS COMMITTEE IS NOW CHAIRED BY SECULAR STATE ALEX PADILLA AND I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. WHO'S BEEN ACTIVELY COLLECTING INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS ON REACHING THE HARD TO COUNT. IN ADDITION THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS INVESTED A RECORD ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS COUNT. MORE THAN SIX TIMES WHAT THE STATE SPENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TEN COMBINED. AND AS A RESULT THE STATE CENSUS OFFICE HAS BEEN ABLE TO USE THESE FUNDS TO INCREASE STATEWIDE PARTICIPATION THROUGHOUT REACHING COMMUNICATION. FILLING GAPS AND CENSUS BUREAU OUT REACH AND I THINK WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT- THE FULLNESS OF OUT REACH ALTHOUGH I KNOW THE CENSUS BUREAU STAFF IS WORKING VERY HARD. AND FORMER FOR AN FORMING STRATEGIC LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS TO BE SURE WE REACH TO. EVERYONE WE CAN REACH AND CALIFORNIA FOR COMPLETE COUNT. SO THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC TO LEARN. ABOUT HOW THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT OPERATION WILL UNFOLD IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS LITERALLY. SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT THESE PLANS TO LEARN HOW WE CAN. MOST PROBABLY PARTNER AND TO BE SURE THAT WHEN APRIL FIRST. COMES STARTS OF THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS THAT WE COUNT EVERY.

BEFORE THOSE FIRST SETS VOTERS COME OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF MARCH- THE NEXT THE NEXT TIME THAT WE GET TOGETHER- AS A JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING. WILL PROBABLY BE TO EVALUATE WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN'T- WITH. EITHER THE INITIAL PHASES OF THE STATE'S PLAN AND EFFORTS OR MAYBE ACTUALLY WHEN THE WHOLE CENSUS EFFORT. IS COMPLETED. TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF AN UTOPSY- TO FIGURE OUT HOW THINGS WENT- AND IT ALSO SEE MIGHT BE TOO STRONG A WORD. MY HOPE IS THAT WHEN WE ALL GET TOGETHER AGAIN AND THE TIME SPENT ON WHAT WENT WRONG IS VERY SHORT- AND THE TIME SPENT ON WHAT WENT RIGHT- TAKES UP ENSURE THAT I THINK THERE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S SOME THINGS THAT WERE HOPING HERE TODAY AND SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE- BASED ON FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM FOLKS AT THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL.

AT THE REQUEST OF STAFF WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO PRESENT. AN UPDATE SINCE OUR LAST OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I KNOW I ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY HIGHLIGHTING SOME KEY DELIVERABLES. THANK RIGHT TO THE HEART OF OUR MISSION THAT IS ENSURING THAT THE HARDEST TO COUNT CALIFORNIANS ARE COUNTED. OUR WORK IS DEFINED BY THREE QUARTER ORGANIZATIONAL. KILLERS COORDINATION COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION. AND FIRST IN THE VEIN OF PARTNER COORDINATION WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE HELD TWENTY STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WORKSHOPS WE FINALIZED AND APPROVED ALL. PARTNER STRATEGIC PLANS PROVED ALL IMPLEMENTATION PLANS THAT INCLUDE SEVENTY SEVEN COUNTY AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THIRTY SIX COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IMPLEMENTATION PLANS. WE'VE DISTRIBUTED GUIDANCE AROUND QUESTIONNAIRE ASSISTANCE CENTERS AND KIOSKS CANVAS SEEING AND PHONE BANKING AND INCENTIVE PURCHASES. WE BUILT A STRONGER COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP KEEP ALL OF OUR PARTNERS APPRAISED. APPRISED OF THE MANY MOVING PARTS WE HAVE BY ADDING REGULAR BI WEEKLY CALLS TO THE PARTNERS. A WEEKLY ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTER AND WEBINARS TO PROVIDE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. AS THE SECOND LARGEST COMPONENT OF OUR WORK WE CRAFTED A MEDIA STRATEGY AND BEGAN TO AIR IN MARKET. WE WERE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT OUR MEDIA BY. GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF THE AUDIENCE WE ARE TRYING TO REACH AND THE COMPLICATIONS OF THE POLITICAL WINDOW. WE HAD TO STRETCH HER DOLLARS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BY BEING STRATEGIC. WE STARTED WITH THE STATEWIDE MEDIA BY. AND THEN THREE FURTHER REFINEMENT AND INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE NEED TO FILL IN CRAFTED A PLAN THAT WORKS FOR EACH OF OUR TEN REGION'S. YOU HEAR MORE FROM MERCURY AND THE NEXT PANEL. BUT SINCE THE END OF AUGUST WHEN THEY WERE FULLY ON BOARDED. THEY HAVE BEEN RUNNING AND RUNNING FAST TO COMPLETE THE WORK. AND LASTLY WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL OF THIS WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IS ROOTED IN DATA. WE HAVE A LEVERAGED ARE CALIFORNIA HARD TO COUNT INDEX. TO FOCUS ON WHAT CENSUS TRACKS ARE LIKELY TO REPRESENT CALIFORNIANS WITH THE MOST BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATING IN THE CENSUS. SO WE CALL OUR ONLINE TOOL SOARED THE STATE WIDE OUT REGION RAPID DEPLOYMENT THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW US AND CONTINUES TO ALLOW US TO ANALYZE CENSUS TRACT DATA. ENDED SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS IN THE CENSUS TRACKS AND IN ADDITION TO MAKING DECISIONS USING THIS TOOL WE ARE ASKING PARTNERS TO USE IT AS THE UNIFYING TRACKING MECHANISM FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD THEIR CURRENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THAT'S ALLOWING US TO MONITOR THOSE INVESTMENTS THIS ALLOWS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO ADDRESS ANY AREAS WHERE THERE WILL BE A LOW RESPONSE RATE AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THROUGH THE NON RESPONSE FOLLOW AT PERIOD. AND SPEAKING OF RESOURCES WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE DESIRE BY THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HAVE ALLOCATED THE REMAINING BALANCE OF OUR FRIENDS. THAT HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED TO S. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING ALLOCATION DECISIONS WERE BASED ON VARIOUS DELIVERABLES THAT WE HAVE IN HOUSE THIS NOTABLY THE REPORTS THAT WERE PROVIDED BY OUR CONTRACTED PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO US. OUR CALIFORNIA'S CENSUS OFFICE LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS PLANNED AS WELL AS THE ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA. WE ANALYZED INSIGHTS FROM OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND DEVELOP FORMULAS TO DETERMINE THE FUNDING LEVELS. IN FOLLOWING FOR PRIORITY AREAS. FIRST WE RECOGNIZE THERE IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR PRINTING. NINETEEN TO ENSURE THAT COLLATERAL MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE TO COMPLEMENT THE OUT REACH STRATEGIES ON THE GROUND. PROVIDING IN LANGUAGE SUPPORT AS NECESSARY TO MEET OUR LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS PLAN. AND ALSO ADDING ACTIVITIES ARE SCALING EXISTING ACTIVITIES TO PRIORITY CENSUS TRACKS THERE ARE FIFTY SEVEN OR ABOVE IN OUR INDEX. AND LASTLY ESTABLISH CONTINGENCY FUND FOR RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCES TO FURTHER INVEST IN TRACKS THAT HAVE BELOW AVERAGE RESPONSE RATES. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THESE DOLLARS MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE COMMUNITY FAST AND BASED ON FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED FROM OUR PARTNERS WE STREAMLINED ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES TO MOVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN FRONT LOW DECISION MAKING. AS WE MOVED INTO DECISIONS AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE FINAL ALLOCATIONS WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CAPACITY. OF OUR CONTRACTED PARTNERS WE CREATED A PROCESS THAT ALLOWS FOR TRANSPARENCY AS WELL AS COLLABORATION. ENGAGING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO HELP US DETERMINE WHAT ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEST SUITED FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. WE PROVIDED A PRELIMINARY UPDATE ON THESE ALLOCATIONS TODAY IT'S A BLUE CHART THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE IN YOUR FOLDER IN FRONT OF YOU AND THIS IS A KEY UPDATE FROM OUR JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY LEGISLATIVE REPORT THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO YOU. ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO. PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE ARE NOT FINAL. AS CONTRACTS ARE STILL BEING RECEIVED AND SEVERAL ARE PENDING FINAL APPROVAL FROM COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT ALL EXECUTED CONTRACTS WILL BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF FEBRUARY. AND IN OUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT DOLLARS REACH PARTNERS IN A TIMELY FASHION RE RELEASED A CONTRACTS EARLY. STREAMLINED THE DELIVERABLE PROCESS FOR THIS LAST ROUND OF FUNDING AND CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH INVOICES ON A ROLLING BASIS. SEVEN CLOSING WHEN I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVESTING TIME IN THE HEARING FROM US TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THE CRITICAL OUTREACH EFFORTS YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE UNDERTAKEN ON BEHALF OF THE HARDEST ACCOUNT CALIFORNIANS WE VALUE YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND YOUR SUPPORT. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. BUT WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL THAT I WAS LIKE MAN. WELCOME THANK YOU DOCTOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE PREPARED FOR THE PRESENTATION. DALY ADDITIONAL PRESENTATION RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND US AS SOME NUMBERS OUT IF I COULD START- YOU MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MEDIA BY- WITH SPECIFIC PLANS- ALL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE AREA OF MICRO TARGETING AS A OUR HEART HOW TO COUNT COMMUNITIES. IF ANY. COURSE THANK YOU SIR- MERCURY YEAH OUR COMMUNICATIONS VENDOR AND IS HERE TODAY AND WILL BE PART OF THE SECOND PANEL BUT JUST TO SPEAK AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL ABOUT. I'M A BIT OF OUR STRATEGY AROUND THIS PARTICULAR AREA- AS SARAH HAD MENTIONED YOU KNOW ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING IS ROOTED AND DATA- AND THAT IS THROUGH HOW ARE INDEX IS VISUALIZED INA CHORE IN A TOOL. THAT WE LOVINGLY REFER TO AS SOARED- ANOTHER ONE FOR THE MIX OF FUN THINGS TO TAKE BACK- WE DID TAKE THAT INDEX ME OVERLY DESIGNATED MARKETING AREAS- AND THEN WHAT OUTLETS MAY BE MOST APPROPRIATE AND TO REACH THE HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITY THAT MAY BE RELEVANT AND THAT PARTICULAR TRACK- SO REALLY TRYING TO LAYER ALL OF THOSE PIECES. AND TO BE AS- SURGICAL AS POSSIBLE- TO REACHING THE COMMUNITY SO IF IT YOU KNOW WE'RE AT. FOR EXAMPLE CHINESE SPEAKING COMMUNITY WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE- MEDIUM YOU KNOW THAT VIA TELEVISION IS IT VIA PRINT- AND IT IS THE BEST SLAVERY OF IN LANGUAGE- AS OUR- STRATEGY DOES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- BACK COMPLEXITY OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSITY. IN OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN WILL BE PRODUCED IN THIRTEEN LANGUAGES. GOT IT THANK YOU OF COURSE. SOME MISS THANK YOU A STRUCTURE AND- I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THE PANEL ASKED THIS OR MAYBE THE NEXT ONE AS FAR AS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE ALLOCATIONS OF MONEY THAT'S GOING TO THE BOARDS HOW MANY ACTUALLY- COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS APPROVED ALLOCATION UNDER THE PLAN THAT'S BEEN SUBMITTED TO A- AND HOW MANY ARE STILL OUT THERE. THAT WE NEED TO GET THEM TO ACCEPT THIS PLAN. SO THEN YOU ALLOCATION OF DOLLARS- IT WAS A PROCESS IN WHICH WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COUNTY AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. SAID TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COUNTY SAID YES WE WOULD LIKE TO USE THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THEY'RE ALL IN A VERY DIFFERENT SCHEDULE WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT TODAY A LOT OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE HAVING- HEARING SUCH AS THIS IN ORDER TO APPROVE. THE ADDITIONAL USE OF THOSE DOLLARS AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATED CHART AS WE RECEIVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE HEARINGS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THANK YOU THAT WOULD BE VERY INFORMATIVE ESPECIALLY THE TO COUNTY THAT WE REPRESENT THE MAYBE WE COULD. GET ENGAGED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS MOVING FORWARD AND ALSO- WITH THE- HAND OUT TO SEA THAT THE NATIVE AMERICANS ARE HARD TO COUNT AREAS. AND WE SEE AND HEAR THAT MANY NATIVE AMERICANS ALSO BELIEVE THE LACK OF AGENCY TO TRULY INFLUENCE DECISIONS SO HOW ARE WE NOW WORKING- WITH FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES BUT ALSO. THE URBAN POPULATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE BEING COUNTED IN THE CENSUS. WE'RE SO EAGER WE- ARE VERY FORTUNATE- FOR THE INVESTMENT THAT YOU ALL HAVE PROVIDED TO THINK YOU AND I THINK WITH THAT- WE HAVE CREATED A TEAM- OF NOT ONLY FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES% THAT HAS HAVE OPTED IN TO SERVE AS TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND SO FAR AS THEIR GOVERNMENT ENTITY ITSELF- BUT WE'VE ALSO CONTRACTED. WITH FOUR OTHER CORD TEAM MEMBERS WHO ARE NATIVE AMERICAN AND TRIBAL OUTREACH STRATEGY- AND WE ARE ALSO FORTUNATE ENOUGH THAT THE GOVERNOR APPOINTED I'M A SOLE PERSON ON OUR TEAM. I'M OUR TRAVEL ADVISOR- KAYLA HOW ARE YOU WHO'S BEEN A WONDERFUL ADDITION- TO HELP COORDINATE THOSE FOR- DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS- RECOGNIZING THAT WHERE OUR DATA IS RELATIVE TO HARD TO COUNT. BUT REALLY RELYING ON ALL OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH I'M HERE CALIFORNIA NEED A VOTE PRODUCT PROJECT- AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA INDIAN MANPOWER- ASSOCIATION AND SO REALLY MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW IF HARD TO COUNT ME LOOK LIKE IT IS HERE. WE REALLY KNOW THE- MAYBE AND HOURS AWAY. BUT IS JUST AS EMPOWER. I'M SO IN. NOT ELEMENT OUR TRUSTED MESSENGERS INTO THE ACTUAL STRATEGY THAT WE EXECUTE. SOUNDS GOOD IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK BEING DONE. IN A NOTICE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. TRIBES HAVE OPTED IN- SO WHAT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN WHEN THEY SAY THEY OPTED IN IS IT INTO THE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN. THOUSAND HOURS OR OTHER THAT OTHER MONEY THAT'S ALLOCATED FOR TRIBES- IN THE HARD TO COUNT AREAS. SO I SEE THE- IN THE HAND OUT IN THE MATERIAL. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TRIBES THAT HAVE OPTED IN THERE SOME THAT AREN'T BUT LOT OF THESE ARE FOR A RECOGNIZED TRIBES. SO HOW ARE THE COMMUNITIES IN THE URBAN AREAS- STILL BEING ABLE TO- GETTING CASE AND THAT TYPE OF FUNDING AND- THAT RESOURCES OUT THERE. SO THERE IS SO THERE'S TIãU CONTRACTORS THAT SONYA MENTIONED- THERE'S THE FOLKS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING- THE AVERAGE DIRECTLY AND RE ALLOCATING SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS TO THE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES SO THAT'S WHEN YOU SEE THE OPT. IN THE ON THE HILL TO THE POT OF THE MONEY THE THREE SIXTEEN OR- YES IN SAID AND SO THOSE THAT DID NOT OPT IN THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE THEY WILL STILL BE RECEIVING. OUTREACH EFFORTS THE WILL BE RECEIVING THE OUTREACH EFFORTS FROM THAT UMBRELLA ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE HAVE- IN ADDITION TO THAT YOUR CORRECT THERE ARE- ARE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION RESIDES IN. URBAN AREAS AS WELL SO WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA- ANY OF A PROJECT OVER NEAR THE WHO IS DOING A LOT OF WORK IN THE URBAN AREAS IN ORDER TO DO THAT OUT REACH. AND THEY ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ALSO CONTRACTED WITH NOONE. SOONER IS OUR MARKETING FIRM THAT IS BEING VERY STRATEGIC AND HER GETTING THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION TO ALSO DO OUR REACH AND COMPLEMENT THE WORK. OF THESE TWO CONTRACTED VENDORS. AND THEY'RE ON THE NEXT PANEL RIGHT IS THAT. ALL I DON'T TO LEARN A IS NOT MERCURY IS ON THE NEXT PANEL THAT THEY CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF THE CORE NEEDED WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING WITH NEW AND- SOON AS A VERY SPECIALIZED NEED OF HIM. AGAIN MARKETING FIRM. IT IS ONE OF THE FOR THAT TO AN AND CLARIFIES THAT CALIFORNIA. REMAINS THE NUMBER ONE- STATE WITH EIGHT AMERICAN- POPULATION IN THE WHOLE UNITED STATES SO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONTINUES TO BE COUNTED IN ALL AREAS FEDERAL RECOGNIZED TRIBES. IN IRVINE TRAVEL TO THEIR LIVING URBAN A CENTER. THANK YOU TILE CAN. MR MY QUESTION IS REGARDING EGGMAN DURING YOUR OPENING THE ROLE OF INVOICES AND SO I JUST WANTED TO ASK- YEAH WHAT IT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE SEEN WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT IS THAT PROGRAM LOOK LIKE AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT IF ANY AT THE FEW ENCOUNTERED ALONG THAT PROCESS OR HAPPY TO REPORT- THAT ONCE THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS WERE SUBMITTED TO US THAT WAS THE SORT OF THE LAST BIG DELIVERABLE FOR US AND THEN INVOICES WERE RECEIVED SHORTLY THERE AFTER FROM ALL OF OUR PARTNERS. TO THEM BERNIE OF OUR PARTNERS HAVE 290% OF THE FUNDING THAT ORIGINAL FUNDING HAS ALREADY IN THEIR HANDS- I THINK THIS ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WHAT WE HAVE CONTINUOUS DONE CAN TO OUR PARTNER THAT TO SUBMIT THE INVOICES IN A TIMELY MANNER- AND ALSO TO THE RIGHT LOCATION I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE A LITTLE BIT OF HICK UPS THE LESSONS LEARNED WE HAD MANY LESS LEARNED WE ARE DOT IN THEM AS HIS QB KEY. AND BEING A YOUR MIND AIMING AT THE END SO YOU SIMILAR OVER. THE DELAY WAS APPROVED SUBMIT YOUR IN. AND THEN WE CAN GO AHEAD MAKE THAT PAYMENT. SOME OF THE OTHER SORT OF IT MIGHT OF. THAT WE'VE MADE TO THE PROCESS ALSO STREAMLINING INTERNALLY SOME OF THE TRACKING MECHANISMS THAT WE'VE PUT INTO PLACE- THIS LAST GO AROUND ALSO WE WERE. WE WERE VERY CONCERNED JUST- AND SHARE YOUR YOUR- PRIORITIES ABOUT GETTING THE DOLLARS OUT SO WE DID. HEY EXTRA TO HAVE- EXPEDITED PAYMENT IS ST COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE FOR THAT LAST- BIG INVOICE WHICH WAS THE DELIVERABLE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. AND THE ANSWERS ARE QUESTION. WHAT IS A SHORT CHALLENGE WITH THE REMAINDER THAT THE 10% HE SAID DELIVERABLES THAT ARE LEFT. I PERCENT IS THE NURSE WHO PLANNED THE NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP PERIOD WE JUST- HAD A PRESENTATION WE HAD A WEAPON ARE WITH OUR PARTNERS TO HELP THEM KIND OF WALK THROUGH WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO SEE AND THAT NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP DELIVERABLE IT'S A PLAN THAT OUTLINES SOME OF THE FIVE SOME OF YOUR PRIORITIES HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO RESPOND DURING THE SELF RESPONSE PERIOD. THAT IS WORTH 5% LAST 5% IS THE FINAL FINAL REPORT SO- THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO THAT- SO IT'S A THAT PART OF THE TINY THE REMAINING. BEING. AND ASA YES. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SO TO YOU'RE US A REAP ON ON THE OUT REGION. I WHAT I. DON'T YET OR IS THE- OF. WHAT IS THE OUTRAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE. ON IN THIS IS BEEN WORKED ON FOR A REALLY REALLY LONG TIME AND I REMEMBER FROM PAST HEARINGS. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE MONEY OUT BUDGETED BUT MONEY GOT INTO THE HANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS WE HAD LOTS OF TESTIMONY FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS EVERYWHERE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO UP AND DOWN THE STATE ALL THE ISSUES ALL THE CONCERNS. SO I STILL DON'T I STILL CAN'T GET THE OR I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU WHAT HAVE WE DONE AS FAR AS IMPLEMENTING THE OUT REACH WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE FIELD. OF AND- I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR MATH TO UP. HOW MUCH DID. THE THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN OUT. TO DO OUTREACH HOW MUCH IS THAT AND- YOU KNOW IT IS IT WORKING BECAUSE HERE WE ARE THREE WEEKS. THIS IS WE BAD HEARINGS WE'VE HAD TESTIMONY ALL THIS SO I DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF. WHERE WERE AT THREE WEEKS FROM THE START. OR FOUR WEEKS FROM THE START I'M HAPPY TO START AND THEN- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SIR CAN HELP FILL IN- HERE JUST TO GIVE A HIGH LEVEL- PICTURE- YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT WE ARE DOING THE WORK- WE ARE TARGETING- APPROXIMATELY ONE IN FOR CALIFORNIANS- THAT ARE THE HARDEST TO COUNT SO THAT IS THAT INDEX THAT WE'VE REFERRED TO IT AS SOMETHING UNIQUE. FORMULA THAT WE REALLY USE DOES THAT IS FOR THAT DATA I'M TAKING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I BELIEVE- AND THAT. BACK FROM STAFF YOU HAVE A LITTLE MAP IN THERE TO REFER TO- JUST TO POINT THAT OUT- AND IT WILL SHOW YOU HOW THOSE TEN REGIONS ARE DIVIDED- AND SO WITH THAT WORK SORT OF THE FIRST SLAYER- IS REALLY THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BENEFIT- ORGANIZATION- WHO IS HELPING TO. COURT ACTIVITIES ON THAT ARE HAPPENING IN ANY GIVEN REGION- YOU BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR STATE. I'M BOTH WITH POPULATION IN GEOGRAPHY AND SO ON- THEY ARE MUCH DIFFERENT. I'M FOR EXAMPLE REGION EIGHT- LOS ANGELES IT IS THE COUNTY IN AND OF ITSELF- AS WELL AS THE SINGLE COUNTY WHERE IS IN REGION ONE- IT IT. IT IS THE RETURN WHICH IS COMPRISED OF THAN SEVENTEEN COUNTIES. AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT EACH OF. ARE ORGANIZING OF LAYERS HAVE IN COORDINATION ARE DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE- SO WE REALLY KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU KNOW I COME FROM THE SPACE FOR I GOT TO WORK- WITH FAIR GROUNDS. AND WHILE THEY ARE SO SIMILAR THEY ARE ALSO UNIQUE- AND SO INCREASING THAT UNIQUENESS- EACH OF THOSE- REGIONS- THEN PARTNER WITH. FOR EXAMPLE THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WHICH WE'VE MADE AN OVER SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. IN DIRECT. SHOW YOU THE P. I'M AS WELL AS STATEWIDE COMMUNITY. WERE THAT ARE FOR ON THIS. POPULATION THAT ME WITHIN A HARD TO COME. AND SO THERE REALLY CA. AND DO. THE WORK SO FOR EXAMPLE IN REGION FOR- THERE IS A FABULOUS PROGRAM- YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THEIR CAN SPEAK TO- WHERE FOLKS HAVE YOU KNOW ALREADY BEEN ON THE GROUND CALLING- CLEANING LIST. IF YOU WILL OF HOUSEHOLDS ON TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION TO PREPARE ON AS I UNDERSTAND THEY'VE MADE OVER A MILLION PHONE CALLS- OVER TWENTY NINETEEN. AND TO HELP EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY AND REGION FOUR- BUT REALLY I'M TO HELP PREPARE THEM FOR THE ACTUAL CAL MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET EARLY EDUCATION MATERIAL THAT HAS BEEN THE FOCUS. GOING TO THE- I'M JUST SURE IN UNITY WHAT THE IS NOT ON THE RE THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT THAT IS A CHANCE OMINOUS WHAT CEREMONY AND ON. I NEED TO JUMP IN. I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE GONE IT LOTS TIMES WHAT WE WERE TARGETING WHY WE WERE TARGETING HOW HOW SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE STATE WHY LANGUAGE YOU NAME. I'M LOOKING FOR WHAT HAVE WE CONCRETE LEE. WHAT KIND OF OUTREACH HAVE WE DONE UP UNTIL NOW JUST A FEW WEEKS AWAY FROM THE YOU GAVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT A PARTICULAR ORGANIZATIONS DOING BUT CAN WE SAY WE'VE SPENT A HUNDRED OR WE'VE GIVEN OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS HOW MUCH CONTACT WE HAVE MADE IN THOSE HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES I I'M I'M JUST NOT GETTING HERE WHAT I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE BY NOW AS FAR AS ON A LOT OF MONEY GETTING OUT TO A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS DID HE GET OUT. DID YOU GET OUT IN TIME OR YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T HAVE A SENSE YET SO LET ME LET ME JUST ADD TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS AS ANYA MADE ABOUT THE ACTUAL WORK THAT'S BEING CONDUCTED ON THE GROUND SEC WE NEED AT THIS THE POPULATION LIVES WE'VE BASED ON THE CENSUS. WE ALSO IT'S NOT A ONE TOUCH AND DONE SO ON AVERAGE IT'LL PROBABLY TAKE ABOUT TWELVE OVER ACTIONS PRESSURE BY OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS SO WITH THESE BINGE BEING IS THE REAL. PASSED I NOW. THE YOU LOOK EMPLOYEE. CHEN IN THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CAN I NOW IN PER. TO DOING CAN TO. IT'S A VARIETY OF. IT COULD BE I'M GOING TO THE TO. ON SUNDAY TO DO A SERMON IN FRONT IT'S ALSO CANVASSING IT'S THE PHONE BANKING IT'S THE EVENTS IT'S BEING AT THE SCHOOLS IT'S GOING TO OTHER COMMUNITY BASED. ON EVENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING I CAN TELL YOU THAT THROUGH THE REPORTING MECHANISM THAT MAY HAVE. BIRD IN WHICH WE UPLOAD IT ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES. OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE BEING CONDUCTED. OUT OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE GOING TO BE REPORTING ON THE NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS SO ONCE THEY ARE DONE WITH THE EVENT. THEY ARE BEING ASKED REQUIRED TO REPORT HOW PRECIOUS BELIEVE HE- AT THE EVENT. IF THIS TURNS THE HER TO KILL HI. HOW MANY OF THEM WERE THEY- SO TO GET TO THE- NUMBERS WE CONTINUE TO THOSE NUMBERS UPDATED- AND WE WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE TO GET MORE SPECIFICS ON HOW MANY ACTIVITIES ARE HAPPENING IN AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA. WE DO WE DO HAVE RESOURCE TO THE TOOLS IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR. OKAY MAYBE I'M NOT MAKING MY OF CLEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE CAN'T GET TODAY FROM YOU THOSE NUMBERS. IF YOU YOU KNOW I'M SURE THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUBMITTING THIS TO YOU OR YOU WOULD SAY SOME OF THE MARIN SOME OF THEM AREN'T SOMEWHERE FAILING. I JUST. I WANT TO KNOW FOR ALL THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED. WHAT KIND OF OUT REGION CONTACT HAVE WE MADE WITH HOW MANY PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE I. EIGHT EIGHT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT METRICS I UNDERSTAND I RESPECT ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH OUR COMMUNITIES ARE REACHING OUT. BUT DO WE KNOW NOW THAT WE'VE TALKED TO. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TEN MILLION PEOPLE WERE OF A STATE OF FORTY MILLION WHO INVESTED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT A. HAVE WE DONE TO. COME WITH. VERY TO DO THIS. IS OF THE WORK ON THIS I JUST. KNOW WHY WE CAN HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE WE'RE AT. QUESTION THE QUESTION RIGHT F. A. PRECIADO THE QUESTION I KNOW THAT- AND BABY YOU CAN FOLLOW UP- WITH THE SENATOR- LEADERS WELL- IN IN A WAY THIS IS KELLY DO TV SO I GUESS IS THAT- I DAY I OR- THAT'S THE PERIL FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE ELECTED OFFICE- AND- SO. I KNOW HAVE YOU SEEN A DEMONSTRATION OF SOARED- AND I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT IT LATER THAT- YEAH THERE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES NERD THAN THEIR ALSO. HELP TENS OF. TALK ABOUT HOW WE FEEL EVERYTHING FOR. DIFFERENT IT'S A SELF. I THINK SO THE HARD TO MISS A- CAP. EVERYTHING US. WAY BECAUSE AND THEN WE HAVE EACH OF THE A CBO ARE WORKING WITH FIRST COMMUNITY GROUPS HAVE DIFFERENT STRATEGY SO- BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A BETTER SENSE AND ALSO- WE TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS- AND THEY TALK ABOUT SOME THE COMMUNICATION METRICS AS WELL- BUT- SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT BECAUSE I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS LATER BY THOSE OTHER PEOPLE QUESTIONS. TO ME SO A SOME MEMBER LORENA ALSO WELCOME AND I SOMEONE WORKING ON SOME EVER CITY COME LIKE A DOVE AND THE CENTER CUBBY EL AND I KNOW. CENTER BECAUSE ALSO HAS A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW OR I WANNA LIVE ON WHAT SENATOR DEVICES SET. A LITTLE. IN CERTAIN. I HER. THINK WE NEED TWELVE TOUCHES TO GET AT THE PEOPLE TO ACT OUR HOW MANY AT THIS. WHAT WAS THE EXPERT HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THEY HAD ONE TOUCH OUR THE COMMUNITIES I LIVE IN A HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITY AND I GOTTA SAY I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING- I I'VE BEEN TOUCHED SIX TIMES BY THE BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN AND I'VE BEEN SUCH ONCE BY CENSUS RIGHT. I'M WONDERING LIKE OUR WHICH TEAM LIKE. AT THIS POINT WE SHOULD OF TOUCH THIS COMMUNITY TWICE ARE ARE WE- HAVE A PLAN ON WHEN THAT TWELVE TOUCH COMES THEN YOU KNOW DO WE DO WE ACTUALLY BREAK IT DOWN TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS LIKE YOU SAID WERE USED TO LIKE IDENTIFYING. ADDRESSES IN PEOPLE OR IS THIS LIKE WELL THIS MANY PEOPLE AND SOME COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TOUCHED AND WE DON'T KNOW BE TOUCH ONCE IN WHOLE BE TOUCH TWENTY FOUR TIMES. JUST WONDERING ON KIND OF THAT DATA DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. DO WE HAVE ANYTHING ON THAT. SEC SO I THINK WORRY ARE EIGHT NOW AND- WE HAVE METRIC SURROUNDED THE MEDIA WE HAVE METRICS AROUND THE MEDIA YES REYES WE HAVE CLICK THROUGH RATES WE CAN SEE THE IMPRESSIONS BY THE RADIO- SOCIAL MEDIA X. CENTER WE HAVE THE IMPRESSIONS THAT OUR OUR COMMUNITY- ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING THROUGH THEIR OUTRAGE ON THE GROUND ACTIVITIES. PUT THE TOGETHER WE WILL BE PUTTING TOGETHER THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING THEM TOGETHER WILL COME VERY QUICKLY ONCE WE- ONCE FOR IN THAT THAT RESPONSE PERIOD BECAUSE WE WILL ALSO BE MEASURING. HOW THE RESPONSE RATES ARE COMING IN TO THE RESPONSE RATES CAN MEN WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE TWENTY TO RESPONSE RATES COMPARISON THOSE JUST SEE. HAVE WE MADE ANY GAME ARE ON TARGET ARE WE BEHIND- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE DATA POINTS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT JUST ST. G. SET WE CAN'T THAT ONE PARTICULAR SET PRACTICE TIME HAS BEEN. HI YOUR- IN TOUCH IS BIG. THE POPULATION IS SO DE. WE'RE TRYING REACH THE POP. WHERE THEY LIVE WORK FOR A PLAY SO THEY MAY BE RECEIVING. TWO IMPRESSIONS THAT DAY BECAUSE- IN HEARING ON THE RADIO AND THEY'RE GOING TO THEIR SCHOOL IN HEARING IT FROM THE TEACHER. SO IT'S HARD TO MEASURE HOW MANY. ONE PERSON HAS SEEN BUT WHAT WE CAN DO AS A CENSUS TRACT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT IT IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REACHING THE COMMUNITIES BOTH ON THE GROUND TO THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS AS WELL AS IN THE AIR. ANYTHING JUST ADD TO THAT- WE HAVE FOCUSED- THE DIFFERENT TEAMS ON TWO PARALLEL WITH PEAK OPERATIONS RELATIVES. ACTUALLY AND SAID YOU'RE A CREATION NOT TO ME I'M SO SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS TO QUESTIONS IT BELIEVE. THERE IS A TRUE INDUSTRY STAND FOR WHAT WE ARE DOING BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA WE LOVE TO BE PIE. HOWEVER YOU RECOGNIZING THAT THE FEDERAL CENSUS BUREAU IS DOING ITS OWN WORK RELATIVE TO ITS PAID BY- TRUTH TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION LOOKING AT OUR INVESTMENT- RELATIVE TO OUR OWN PAID BY WHICH YOU HEAR MORE ABOUT. WHERE IT REALLY COMMUNICATION HAS STARTED VIA PAID MEDIA BUYS BUT REALLY STARTS TO RAMP UP- WHEN PEOPLE ASK. IF THAT VACATION FROM THE CENTERS- MADE MARK WITH OF PEAK PACKED YOU THROUGH WHAT WILL CALL THE BEGINNING OF SINCE THE SEASON- MID MARCH TO THE END OF APRIL. ON AND THAT CONTINUE TO HOPEFULLY FOLKS AND UNION SHOULD SOMEONE AT. THE DOOR I'M WHO AND IT IS AN BERMAN WE NOTED THE WORK OUT LANCE B. AND WE IN YOU BEING WITH THEM. BUT. VISIBILITY. STATE OF POINTS AND I SER MENTION WE CONTINUE TO PUSH FOLKS TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT- ONCE THE COUNT- DOES CONCLUDE THAT WE DO HAVE THAT VERY CLEAR PICTURE- ESPECIALLY RELATIVE TO- RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TWENTY THIRTY OF ALL OF THE AMAZING THINGS THAT DID WORK. ON AND WERE EFFECTIVE IN REACHING OUT COMMUNITIES. OKAY. CENTER I'M BURKE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK ALL THE MEMBERS WHO HAVE JOINED HERE TODAY AS SOMEONE MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE HOW MANY FOLKS FROM THE TWO HOUSES HAVE APPEARED OF FIRST STEP THANK YOU TO SENATOR ALSO CENTER ALSO LED THE EFFORT IN TERMS OF RESOURCES THROUGH THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOUR WHEN SHE WHEN SHE WOULD SHARE AND WHAT. ABOUT THE- WERE. I'M TRICKS PERFORMANCE MEASURE AND I KNOW THE WAS BEFORE YOU WERE A PART OF THE SENSES PROGRAM BUT FALLING ON FROM ASSEMBLY LORETTA GETS FLETCHER IS QUESTIONS ALSO BOB PERHAPS IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH US WHAT YOUR METRICS ARE IN YOUR PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS A POINTS UP THERE IF. OF YOU EXT OF YOU KNOW TOUCHES PER PERSON BY THIS TIME HAVE YOU DONE A SURVEY HAVE YOU MET THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T MET THAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT TERMS OF HIRING WHAT IS YOUR PERFORMED WANNA HIRE TEN PEOPLE BY THE- FAR WITH SEVEN WHERE ARE YOU ON YOUR PERFORMANCE MAY ARE YOU ON YOUR. SO WE'RE IT. I CAN HEAR FROM ALL QUESTIONS OF VERY IN IS TO WHERE YOU ARE THOSE THINGS. I DON'T EXPECT TO TELL US ALL THAT TODAY BUT I WOULD ASK IF YOU WOULD DISTRIBUTE BOTH YOUR METRICS AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES. AND CHEMICALLY ISSUES NOW- IN TERMS OF THE MONEY I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOME. MONEY YET TO BE DISTRICT. FINE I ASSUME THAT THERE'S A PLAN TO DISTRIBUTE MANY WHAT HOW MUCH MONEY IS YET TO BE DISTRIBUTED. HE STATIONS OF OUR OCCUR WE ARE HAD CONVERSATIONS AROUND DISTRIBUTING AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY TO YOU OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS THIS CONVERSATIONS ARE CONCLUDING OF SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS HAVE ACCEPTED THE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THROUGH COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATION SOME OF THE CASE IS OF SAID WE WANT YOU TO GO AHEAD USE THE DOLLARS AND MISS COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS. SO WE ARE PRETTY DONE WITH THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR CONTRACTS COMMIT WE'RE WAITING FOR BOARD OF SUPERVISOR APPROVAL ON SOME OF THOSE COUNTY CONTRACTS SO ONCE THOSE COME IN. AND THERE APPROVED 90% OF THOSE DOLLARS WILL BE OUT. SO I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GONNA CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THERE'S ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE ALLOCATED TO. OF HARD TO KILL VETERANS IS THAT RIGHT. BUT YOU HAVE MIDDLE FINE ORGANIZATION TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT PROJECT. YEAH AND CALVET WHAT ABOUT CALVET. Q. I'M SENATOR AND WE ARE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH CAL THAT IS A PART OF WORKING WITH SEVERAL OF OUR CD AGENCIES THAT TOUCH DIFFERENT POPULATIONS- AND THEY HAVE BEEN A GREAT PARTNER- BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WE HAVE FOUND AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS- TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE USE THOSE DOLLARS- KEY ENGAGEMENT THAT IT IS- BEFORE US IS THAT COUNTY OFFICE OF SERVICE- VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS- YOU IN THEM INFORMATION AS ONE OF CON TO WORK WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES IN ADDITION WE ARE LOOKING AT BOLSTERING.

WHAT WAS THE ANSWER TO THE- OR- REACHING OUT TO VETERANS AND ACTIVE MY WHO WERE HERE WE ARE ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF THAT AFFAIRS BUT ABSENT A STEEP WE'RE GONNA MY ARE OR IF COMMUNITY BETTER ORGANIZATION MODELING AFTER THAT BALANCE OF OUR COUNTRY WE HAVE ON TAKEN ALTERNATE APPROACH FOR REACHING A COMMUNITIES THE COMMUNITY. THE CALIFORNIA THAT WE AWARE HAVE A HIGH POPULATION. AND YOU KNOW I THINK I'M- ABOUT THE BETWEEN. COM AND GAVE. AND THE ACTUAL FOR OF ACTIVE. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S REALLY FLEW. AND YET APRIL FOR DISPATCH APPROACHING AND IN MY MIND LISTENING TO YOU ARE. I'M THINKING ABOUT THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE EXPANDED AND THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF THAT AND IT SEEMS REALLY- PAY. AND SO. IF THERE IS A WAY TO. HELP MY MIND FIND SOME CLARITY WITH MILESTONES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND REACHED IF WE ARE MAKING THE TIME LINES THAT WE HAVE SET- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE- I JUST LET MY MIND MONEY REALLY. ACROSS THE STATE AND THEN IT'S LIKE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY INFORMATION BUT WE'RE TALKING TO LOTS OF PEOPLE AND SO MAYBE I'M JUST HEARING THE THING WRONG THAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT CAN YOU TELL ME THAT I'M HEARING YOU WRONG. SO THE IMPLEMENTATION. PLANS WHICH WERE RECENTLY SUBMITTED TO US OF THOSE CONTAIN THOUSANDS OF LINES OF ACTIVITIES. THERE'S ACTIVITIES ARE. WHAT WE ARE INVESTING IN. SO WE ARE INVESTING IN- INDIVIDUALS RUBY AT VENTS INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WILL BE CONDUCTING A PRESENTATION. INDIVIDUALS AND THEY CAN BE THEY'LL BE DOING THE PHONE BANKING AND THE CANVASSING. SO THE CONVERSE IT AND- I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM BECAUSE CONVERSATIONS SEEM REALLY LIKE AND WHAT DO YOU SAY IN. BUT COM. REALLY IS WHAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN THESE HAVE BEEN IN MULTIPLE WAYS BECAUSE WE ARE. WE ARE WORKING KIM. SAID STATE WHAT THIS DOES A THREE. TO WE TO. KEEP ON WHAT. THE CENSUS AS THE FIRST COVER. THE VERB TENSE AND SO I'M JUST WONDER IF HAVE PASSED HIM YOU RIGHT YES YES ABSOLUTELY SO THESE CONVERSATIONS BEEN GO ON SINCE LATE LAST YEAR. SEPT OCTOBER WE HAD A- PLAN WORKSHOP IN THIS. EVEN DURING THE SIMPLE PLAN WORKS WE ARE HAD OUR COMMUNITY TRUST A PARTNERS ARE READ IN THE FEEL HAVING CONVERSE AND UP A LOT IN IN RE REACHING OUT AND BUILD A THAT IN FOR. IN THE COMMUNITIES SO IT HAS IT IT IS OUR IT BEHALF IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN AND IT WILL ONLY HAVE TO CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE RESPONSE. SPELL YEAH MY OTHER COLLEAGUES OKAY GET THAT DATA FROM. ABSOLUTELY ONE QUICK UP AND WE GET THOSE IN PLANS YOU MENTIONED YOU RECENTLY BECAUSE IT BE GREAT FOR US BE ABLE TO TAKE A AT THOSE I WAS GOING ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU M. IF. COUPLE QUESTIONS WELL APPRECIATE ALL QUESTION MY COLLEAGUE. TO SO CERTAINLY THE YOU'VE HEARD A THING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SELECT I THINK GAME MORE CERTAINTY WHAT DONE UP TO DATE I THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING. TO THE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THE PREP WORK LEE UP SO WHAT SO BASICALLY IT'LL FOR TRADE IS GO DAY AND GET THEIR THERE IN. RIGHT ACT FRANKLY PRIVATE ABOUT WEEK AFTER OUR PRIMARY ELECTION AND I DO WAY KNOWLEDGE AND ON SURE WE'LL HAVE DISCUSS MERGER WELL TIE ME A MESSAGE. IN AND SO FORTH AS WELL SO HOW HOW TO DO THAT. THIS GO DAY. WELL HAVE IS PEOPLE STAR FILLING OUT KEY TALKING THE PROCESS BY WHICH OKAY SO HOW IS THAT PEOPLE STE FILLING OUT THEIR SENSE. YOUR GET I BELIEVE DATA AND YOU SENSE OF BOROUGH LIKE WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT FILLED IT OUT BUT BASS WHICH SENSES TRACKS IN SO FORTH SO YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU MADE YOU PRESS TO CAN PLANS WILL BE WE I THINK WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR GEO OTHER THIS IS LIKE A SEVERAL MY THE TEAM HELLO WITH MAIL IN BALLOTS AGO. SIMILAR SO WHAT FORCES YOU SEE. SEC THAT'S IS ROLE OUT DURING A ROLL AND THEN YEAH FOR NOT BEING MAY JUNE. S. THAT I UNDERSTAND IS THAT THING SO WHAT ARE THE PLANS FOR IT FOR THAT CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR DRESSING- THE THESE THINGS THAT PROBABLY NOT JUST CONTINGENCY WE SHOULD EXPECT IT RIGHT. NOW INDEED I THINK- WHAT TO EXPECT EXACTLY IS ON THE PART YET TO BE SEEN- SO YES DOCTOR PAN THANK YOU- FOR. NOTING AND WE WILL GET. IN FOR ME THAT COMES DOWN FROM THE US CENSUS BUREAU- ONE OF THE IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS TO MAKE- IS THAT BECAUSE IT IS THE FIRST AND THAT OFFER SPOTS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLINE. WE WILL HAVE. OUT HERE SAID ON BECAUSE IN TWENTY TEN THE RESPONSE ATES THAT WE WILL HAVE WILL BE RELATIVE TO MAIL PARTICIPATION RATE SO WE KNOW. YOU'RE AROND HAVING TO FEEL SOMETHING OUT PHYSICALLY AND SUBMITTING AT RELATIVE TO BEING ABLE TO GO ON YOUR PHONE OR OTHER DEVICE WILL BE DIFFERENT IT IS SOMETHING. AND WE ARE MINDFUL OF- BUT FEEL CONFIDENT AS A RELATIVE DATA POINT- IN LOOKING AT HOW EACH. TRACK IS. FUNDING THAT WE BE ABLE TO FIVE ON SOME OF OUR- DECISION MAKING AND REALLY. IN WORKING WITH THOSE CONTRACTED PARTNERS- THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS AND OTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE OUT REACH TEAM IS HAVING DIRECTLY WITH THOSE. DOORS THE HAVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE VIDEOS ARE. ON NOT REALLY ABLE TO MOVE AND WHAT ACTIVITIES CAN BE FLEXIBLE. SO IN A SCENARIO PERHAPS WE HAVE TWO TRACKS NEXT TO EACH OTHER FOR THE SAKE OF EXAMPLE. ONE IS UNDER BRING ONE BECAUSE- FORM. WE TAKE THOSE OTHER. AND SLIDE THEM. RIGHT AND TRY TO CONCENTRATE ON THOSE THAT HAVE EVER. YET AS WELL AS- IN AREAS WHERE. WE MADE ENOUGH LOW RESPONSE RATE INTO TEN MAYBE. I'M JUST. I'M HAPPY HELP RESOLVE STRUCK. FURTHER AND A LITTLE BIT FOR ETHNOLOGY ING YOU KNOW TEN RIGHT. AREAS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE AND THE TERMS OF FINANCIAL. RESOURCES NOW WITH ABOUT. OR GET OUT BUT PORTION OF FOR RESOURCE DO YOU NEED FOR BASE THESE TYPE OF ARE ARE DO YOU EXPECT THEM OF ITS RATE BUILT IN AND EXPECTATIONS WITH EXISTING CONTRACT TO A DO YOU. DO YOU DESERVE OF RESOURCES THAT YEAR I WOULD SAY HOLDING YEAH BUT YEAH BASICALLY INTO BASICALLY THE TYPES OF ACT IS TO PROVIDE TARGET. YES FOR COMING IT IS THAT THAT AS THE CENSUS IS ROLLING ON. THIRTY TWO DIFFERENT POTS OF CONTINGENCY PLANS SO THE ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION- I WALK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE PRIORITY AREAS AND ONE OF THEM WAS THAT CAN CHEN C. FUNDS SO MAKING SURE THAT PARTNER MAKING NUYS THAT IT'S NOT A- SCENARIO BUT IS. ONE SCENARIO WHEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO REINVEST SO WHETHER THAT'S PRINTING MORE IN LANGUAGE X. THAT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL JUST RECOGNIZE ZING N. EMPHASIZING THAT IT WILL HAPPEN TO MAKE SURE YOU SENT US AT THE BOTTOM IN THE PROGRAM. THE MONEY ON THIS SIDE WE ALSO HAVE OUR OWN CONTINGENCY FUNDING THAT THAT WE WILL HAVE AVAILABLE AND AGAIN I CAN GO THROUGH. YOU CAN GO TO PRINT CHANGE IT MAY NEED TO GO THROUGH. ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION EVERYWHERE WE'RE ONLY. ABOUT HOW MUCH DO YOU DO YOU ARE YOU. SAYING THAT ROUGHLY. IT BUDGET AFFECT WEALTHIEST A LOOK IT UP MAYBE CAN GET BACK TO ME ON THAT. LEDGE REPORT IN TERMS OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WE SET ASIDE FOR CONTINGENCY BUDGET. OKAY BUT WILL. OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS. AGAIN SOARED. FISHY TO TOOL WE DEVELOP THAT- I THINK YOU HEARD ABOUT THE NEED FOR IT TO BE ROBUST AND SO FORTH- BUT ONE THE OTHER THING- THAT HURT A LITTLE FEEDBACK ON ANY APPRECIATE THAT WE WANNA BE DATA DRIVEN. DATE ALSO TO BE COLLECTED AND TAKES TIMES AND SOURCES. SO HAVE YOU BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH COMMITTEE PARTNERS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF DATA ACTUALLY THE- DOES THE DAY WE LIKE TO HAVE THERE'S THE IT REALLY NEED. AND SOMETIMES THE LIKE THAT HAVE MEANS A LOT OF EXTRA WORK SO- THAT DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS OUT. THE RESPOND BURDEN. LOADING THING TO. WHEN WE WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION FOR FROM SOME. LIKE IT'S ALMOST. PEOPLE ENORMOUS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A POLITICAL LOT OF DAY AND- THAT TAKES A BUDGET AND THEY'RE ALMOST I DON'T TOUCH THE THING THIS IS GOING ME ALL THESE QUESTIONS AND I HAVE TIME TO ACTUALLY ANSWER ALL THESE QUESTIONS RIGHT. SO CAN YOU JUST ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. SO ON THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS WE TOOK. PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO US AND WE'RE DOING THE CLEANUP. SO THAT. THERE IS A LOT OF EFFORT THEY'RE GOING ON. JUST ONE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE TEAM IS WORKING IS SUPER FAST ON THAT AND- AS- ON THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN UPLOADS. AND THEN ON THE REPORTING SIDE. FOR OUR ACTIVITIES SAID THE PARTNERS ONCE THEY COMPLETE THE ACTIVITY THEY GO. IN AND THEY TELL. US THERE'S PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE. DIFFERENT FIELDS THAT ARE MY- CATS. SO THAT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF EACH. POPULATION THAT YOU READ. STORE SOME. SENSE OF IT- AND EVERYTHING IS. PRETTY MUCH. OPTIONAL SO WE DID. GO TO. EXERCISE MINIMAL. EFFORT TO GET. AGAIN I SENT TO. GREAT CELLS ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK YOU MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENT YES YES SENATE KALLIO I APOLOGIZE I AM I HAVE SOME NO BEEN I REALIZED THERE THEIR QUESTIONS CURRY BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THE TO THOSE QUESTIONS WE JUST HAD A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO. THERE ARE OVER IT OF THAT SO. I'M THEIR COME NEXT WHAT THEM SOME. AND THEN IF WANTED TO UP I DO COULD YOU TELL ME WHO. WHO HAS OVERSIGHT AND OF THEIR CONTRACT. OF COURSE- ARE A DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNICATIONS IS HERE AS WELL HER NAME IS MARTHA DOMINGUEZ THAT IF THE EXECUTIVE TEAM MEMBER- THAT IS THE CONTRACT MANAGER FOR MERCURY. ON THAT SIDE OF IT YEAH- OUR ENTIRE TEAM FAIR AND I ARE ALSO. I'M HERE FOR OVERSIGHT A MONTH THAT'S HELPFUL. AS AS WE START TO LOOK AT BUT- THE KIND OF THE OUTRAGE THAT WE'RE DOING- MY THINK WE ALL HAVE IDEAS ABOUT. WHAT WOULD BE GOOD. TO GET OUT THERE. AND FRANKLY HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF. LEARN BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF MEDIA OUT REACH IN IN MY REGION AS I TRAVEL AROUND AND I HAVEN'T. SEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES AND SOME A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE CAN WE KNOW WHO TO CALL HOW TO. INVOLVE THEM WHEN I THINK ALL OF US WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN IN THAT OUT REACH SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN HAVE COMMUNICATION THE BETTER I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SELF. THE APPRECIATE THAT. WELL ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE I AM AND I KNOW THAT- WERE ALSO WORKING TOGETHER TO THINKING ABOUT THE LUNCH EVENTS AND CERTAINLY. IT'S OF POINTED OUT THAT OUR DISTRICT. OFFICES HAVE. RELATIONSHIPS AND I KNOW WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT- TERMS OF THE ACTUAL WATCH. THIS OF COURSE- WE ARE YOU KNO WE WANT TO BE.

BY LIKE I SAID THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY TEARS A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- WERE YOU GOING TO GIVE YOU GUYS AN UPDATE ON ALL OF THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE CENSUS OFFICE TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE ALL SHARE. IN PARTICULAR. THE COUNT CALIFORNIANS. UP HIGHLIGHTING A POINT THAT WAS MADE IN THE EARLIER PANEL. OUR CAMPAIGN TO HAS BEEN DRIVEN- BY. DATA AS WELL AS RESEARCH AND THAT INCLUDES RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE BEFORE WE WERE PARTNERS OF THE STATE. AS WELL AS RESEARCH THAT'S UNDER WAY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDER WAY THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN SO THAT WE CAN ADJUST AND- PIVOT. NECESSARY BUT IT'S ALSO COMMUNITY AT. ARMS REALLY HERE TO LIFT UP THE WORK. THAT'S BEING. FOUND IN THE- EIGHTIES. WELL AS- I. YOUR INSIGHT. AND APPLY THEM TO OUR- MEDIA. COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY AS AS WE GO. THAT CLEAN AB ELEMENT FROM THE BEGINNING OF AN IN. BRAND AND APPLYING THAT TO ACROSS CREATIVE PLATFORMS THAT AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CREATIVE- BOTH THAT WE'VE- DEVELOPED AND CONTINUING TO DEVELOP ACROSS. MEDIA PLATFORMS ALL OF IT KEEPING COMMUNITIES AND THE VARIOUS CULTURES THAT ARE I CAMPAIGN IS AIMING TO REACH REALLY REALLY CENTRAL TO THAT CREATIVE AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOME OF THAT AND IN THE COMING SLIDES. I AND THEN IT'S PART OF MY JOB IN OUR TEAM'S JOB TO ENSURE THAT WERE BEING STRATEGIC ACROSS PLATFORMS WHETHER IT'S PAID MEDIA SOCIAL MEDIA EARNED MEDIA. THAT WERE REALLY ECHOING OURSELVES AND THE SAME MESSAGES. REINFORCE CASE TO SEND. HAVE FOUND MODE. IN ANOTHER. ONE HUNDRED AND BETTER THERE ARE APT TO PUT. I AND- PARTICULAR FEET WE'RE LIFTING UP ON WHAT CHANNEL WE- WERE. NOT ON. REST OF THIS SO THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE TO AND- THE STATURE. AND THE THEMES THAT WERE THAT WERE DEPLOYING THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN. SO JUST GET SHOWING YOU SOME SAMPLING OF OUR CREATIVE- WHICH LIKE I SAID IS REALLY ROOTED IN A CULTURAL CONGRUENT OUR STRATEGY. YOU HAVE SOME OF YOUR SOME OF OUR OUR DIGITAL ADVERTISEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE MARKET PLACE FOR A WHILE THOSE ARE TYPICALLY THE EASIEST FASTEST TO DEPLOY AND CAN BE REALLY STRATEGIC THAT AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU SEE. A VERY SIMILAR LOOK AND FEEL TO ONE OF OUR PRINT ADVERTISEMENTS THEIR- I SHOULD MENTION THAT OUR ADVERTISING I. COMES FROM IS ROOTED ALSO IN THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN SO WE HAVE DEPLOYED ADVERTISING ACROSS THE THIRTEEN LANGUAGES THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE PLAN I WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND CONTINUE TO FOLLOW WHICH LANGUAGES ARE RESONATING WITH WHICH COMMUNITIES BOTH THROUGH OUR MEDIA AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE DEPLOYED A RANGE OF MESSAGES I THAT THAT TARGET VERY SPECIFIC AGE TO SEIZE IN SOME CASES IT'S ABOUT A VERY SPECIFIC AUDIENCE ANOTHER CASES IT'S JUST ABOUT KEEPING THAT GENERAL EDUCATION MESSAGE. ON THE RIGHT IS AN AD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH A STATE AGENCY PARTNER OVER AT FIRST FIVE TO CO BRAND- AND THAT'S A THEME THAT YOU'LL HEAR THROUGHOUT TODAY IS HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS. TO WORK TOGETHER AND ENHANCE THE CAMPAIGN LIKE I SAID BOTH FROM THE GROUND AND THE AIR. SIMILARLY WE ARE- DEPLOYING CULTURALLY CONGRUENT IMAGES AND MESSAGES ALL ACROSS OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS. WE HAVE BUILT A STEADY FOLLOWING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF LAUNCHING TWITTER FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM. THE ILLUSTRATED SUGGEST THAT ILLUSTRATE A GRAPHIC AT THE TOP IS SOMETHING WE LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE- HEARD IN NUMBER OF OUR FOLKS. THAT SOMETIME IN SOME CASES THESE IT STRAIGHT IT OF GRAPHICS ARE REALLY REALLY REST EATING WITH COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT I THINK GENERALLY KIND OF FUN BUT THEY ALSO SAY FEET. IN THEM WITHOUT BEING VERY SPECIFIC PARTICULAR PC SO I. ILLUSTRATIONS ALLOW SOME OF OUR AUDIENCE TO SEE THEMSELVES IN IT WHETHER IT WHETHER IT'S SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS LIKE THEM OR NOT. SIMILAR TO THE BOTTOM HERE WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE PARTICULAR DAYS ON THE CALENDAR WHEN IT MAKES SENSE- AND WHEN THERE ARE PARTICULAR DAYS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO OUR AGE TO SEE COMMUNITIES. THE LEFT SIDE FUTURE SEMESTERS BETTER AGAIN MORE JUST CONTINUING THAT DRUMBEAT OF EDUCATION SO THAT PEOPLE WE ARE TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE TENSEST BEFORE IT'S UNDER WAY. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY I GUESS THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO IN JANUARY TWO FEATURE WITH A DIGITAL BILLBOARD THIS IS ACTUALLY. A TRUCK IN THE MLK THEM DAY PARADE IN. LESS BEECHING'S FEATURING SOME OF OUR OUR CAMPAIGN SO JUST I DIDN'T GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE CAMPAIGN DEPLOYED. WHAT I LIKE TO CALL IN REAL LIFE. BUT THIS WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE WORKING COORDINATION WITH CALIFORNIA CALLS IN MY BLACK COUNCIL REALLY. A CO BRANDED THIS DIGITAL. MOVING BOARD IF WELL AS PART OF THAT THAT REALLY- INCREDIBLE PARADE. OKAY THIS IS WHERE THE TECHNICAL ASPECT COMES IN ALT TAB RIGHT SO WE ALSO HAVE KING IN CLOSE JACKSON WITH OUR MEDIA PARTNERS. PLAY FOR YOU THAT LITTLE CLASS OF OUR AND AT A RECENT SEGMENT THAT WE TAPED WITH UNIVISION AND THIS IS ACTUALLY START AIR THIS WEEK AS PART OF. AMERICA AND LET'S SEE ALL I GET THIS RIGHT DICE. SINCE YEAH. WHEN WE LET HIM BUT AS AN ADULT ON DEVELOPERS ARE NOT GETTING MOST IN A THOUSAND GO TO CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT TO MAKE THIS ALL IT'S ALL ME THAT THIRTY WAS REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS IN SOME OF THE COMBINED YOU CAN IF THE.

YEAH DOING BUDDY PLEASE HELP. AND THE KNOWLEDGE IN I THINK THAT'S THE HER PART OF THIS BECAUSE IS WE FOCUSED ON THE HARD ACCOUNT POPULATION WHICH MEAN WERE BEING HARD AND WAY THAT WE ARE DELIVERING OUR MEDIA I'M OUR TEAM DID A VERY STRATEGIC APPROACH TO THE BY DOING AN OVERLAY OF ONLY TRYING TO BUY YEAH HEART. A DOESN'T. REACHES I FIVE. SISTERS OUR INTO THE SPELL BEEN MINE MOST OF OUR MEDIA IS IN THE AT WERE NOT BUYING GEN PRICE IF YOU SEE IT DOT IF YOU'RE ON A GENERAL BROADCAST STATION LIKE A EASIER THE STATE YOU'RE REALLY THE THING THE US CENSUS BUREAU ADS IF YOU SEE AN AD ON THURMOND THAT'LL KIND OF. TENDER LIKE YOU'RE SAYING. OUR OUR IN OUR PLACE. IN YOUR PROP SEE OUR OF HOMES THE MOST IN THE CENSUS TRACK AREAS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE'RE PLACING THEM. THAT'S GONNA BE THE MOST VISUAL- THING THAT YOU'LL PROBABLY SEEN. OUR HOPES IS THAT YOU'RE NOT SERVED AND ALL ADAM SO I WANTED TO OUR AS A ONE TIME RIGHT. OVER BECAUSE WE'RE BEING VERY GET IT IN THE WAY THAT WERE. ALSO YEAH WE DID EXPRESS LESS CONCERN BECAUSE IT ISN'T IT IS A LOT OF MONEY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE HE WOULD. ONLY SEE AND GENERAL. TRACK SHOP PLACE THAT YOU. MORE WE WILL BE TÁI BUT IT A LITTLE MORE I GENERAL I'M OUT REACHES SOCIAL WILL BE SAME WAY BECAUSE THERE AUDIENCES AREN'T TARGETED TO OUR AMHERST RELATIONS. I PRINCE IS ANOTHER ONE THAT I THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE IT WILL BE A GOOD PLACE FOR YOU TO PICK UP AND SEE THINGS- I EARNS MEDIA WHEN. JESSICA CAME IS FANTASTIC I'M GETTING NEWS COVERAGE ABOUT IS ALSO GOING TO NOT BE AND THAT THIS ACCOUNT POPULATIONS THAT IS GOING TO BE AN- RULING WAS RESPONSIBLE THING TO COVER IT SO I THINK. IS A GOOD. POLICY THE YEAH I'M FROM OUR- I'M- WE DO. AND HAS OVER DEL BIRD ON METRICS I'M I'M FROM AN INDUSTRY STANDARD IN SOME CASES DOUBLE THE INDUSTRY STANDARD AND I'LL SHARE WITH YOUR ISSUE STANDARDS ARE BASED ON EVERYONE NOT THE HARDEST OF COUNTY ELATION SO UNDERSTAND THAT MEET OUR CAMPAIGN IS PERFORMING EVEN BETTER THAT THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY SO EASY DOUBLE WIDE WHAT'S THE MEASURE I'M WELL THERE'S A ACTUALLY. WHEN WE- AND GET. TO USE. SHOP CLICK THROUGH I'M ALL OF A CLEAN HIGHER AND I PULLED THE NUMBER UP ON MY FOR IN CASE WE WANTED TO BILL THAT LIKE HAVE IT BUT I WANT YOU KNOW FOR US. MATT THANKS GOING TO BE. STANDARDS A ON. RELATION AND OUR CAMP. IS A- MORE FOR. RIGHT SO. WHEN WERE SAYING DOUBLE THE INDUSTRY STANDARD WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS. WE'RE DELIVERING EVEN BETTER THAN WHAT THAT REPRESENTS BECAUSE OF THE TARGETED NESS OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND THE WAY THAT WE HAVE TO REACH VERY SPECIFIC- MEMBERS OF OUR STATE- SO I'M- I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION ON WHAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO. SEE RIGHT NOW IT'S HARD. TO I THINK- IS BOTH FOR YOU. I THINK FOR THE CENSUS STAFF IS IN THE AUDIENCE. IS GOING TO. IT I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH PROBABLY A DISTRICT OFFICES IN THE LEGISLATURE. WHAT IS ACTUALLY. DIFFERENT PEOPLE- I THANK EL WAY TO COMMUNICATE LIKE LOOK YOU KNOW WE'RE LIKE HERE'S A LIST OF ALL THE OP ED AT AND WHERE YOU'RE PUBLISHED RATE THAT'S IN A STRICT THERE SOMETHING LKE THAT I REALIZE IT'S A LITTLE EXTRA TIME TO DO BUT- THIS. IS NOT. RISING TARGET ARE THE COUNT FIVE. THAT TRYING TO FIGURE HOW TO MAKE THAT. MORE THE OTHER THING THAT I JUST WANNA SAY IS THAT IT'S IF. YEAH I THINK. IN TERMS OF CONFIDENCE BUILDING- THIS MUCH- SHARING AS POSSIBLE YOUR THEME HERE SHARING SHARING INFORMATION SHARING WORK. ETCETERA AND- WE HAVE TO. FORMATION TRANSFORMATION CAMPAIGNS BUT- NO BUT I THINK THE MORE OF THE ARE ABOUT WE'RE DOING- THAT IS GOING TO. ALSO I THINK. PEOPLE GET EARNERS LIKE WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEY'RE NOT. ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON IT AND- GREAT. DANTE AND TO WORK OUT BUT. FOURTH BECAUSE PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE COULD USE THAT YOU COULD USE INFORMATION TO HELP THEM TO WRITE SO WE SHOULD BE SHARING ALL THE RESOURCES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAXIMIZE. EVERYBODY IT'S NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE IN THE END IT'S ABOUT OUR COLLECTIVE PERFORMANCE WHICH IS GONNA BE RESPECTED BY WHAT THE FINAL COUNT IS. ONLY FINISH YOUR SENSES AT A AT ULTIMATELY THAT'S THE TRUE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE- METRIC IN WHICH IS WHY. THE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS WHO IS THIS THING ROLLS OUT WITH THAT IF I GAPS AND HOLES HOW WE BECAUSE IN THE END. YOU'LL IT REALLY MATTERS IS THAT WE CANNOT EVERYBODY ARE NOT. HOW YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE WE GOT THAT RIGHT SO- SO I KNOW WHAT I HAVE IN YOUR METRICS FOR INDIVIDUAL PARTNER PEOPLE DID THEY DO THAT THE VISUAL JOB LOSS OF. BUT ALL THE ONLY. OF SISTER RIGHT AND OF. THIS IS A KIND OF IN THE- PEOPLE THAT REALLY WELL. BECAUSE THAT SO WELL BE. SOMEONE DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S ELSE. AN COULD YOU IT AT THE TIME. AT THE TIME. WHICH COULD HAVE MADE. THEN WE DIDN'T. AND IT DIDN'T WORK RIGHT SO. THAT'S YOU KNOW SO I KNOW EVERYONE HAS A PEACE BUT ALSO HOW TO BE SURE COORDINATE SHARE INFORMATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE DON'T KNOW. COULD BE USEFUL TO SOMEBODY ELSE. UNLESS IT. IS PROBABLY MAKE SURE THINGS ARE AS PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE. SO WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE- AIMING AT. THAT MAKES SENSE. OKAY OUR THAT I AND FORTY HAVE TO OUT FOR A FEW MORE. OF SONG OF IT ON TO CHEER BROUGH HOOSIER WHO I KNOW IT'S BEEN. PATIENT WITH. HAS HIS OWN QUESTION AND I. WILL TRY TO GET BACK. THANK YOU DON'T HAVE BEEN- AND A LOT OF THE- IN ORDER QUESTIONS OF AN COVERED SO.

WITH SOME FOLKS WHERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE. AMAZING THINGS AS SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS COULD DO AND THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T REALLY WANT THE ONES WITH. FIFTY MILLION FOLLOWERS REALLY WANT THE ONES WITH LIKE TEN THOUSAND FOLLOWERS THAT THEY HAVE REALLY- RABBIT. YOU KNOW THE THOSE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE FOLLOW ON EVERYWHERE THAT THEY SAY AND EVERYTHING THEY DO WHAT'S OUR STRATEGY ON THAT FRONT- TO. TO TRY TO. YOU KNOW REACH FOLKS WHERE THEY ARE. YOU TOUCHED ON IT ACTUALLY I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS QUALITY OVER OVER. I IT'S NOT ABOUT MANY. IT'S WHO IS IN THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE AND YEAH AND THINKING STRATEGICALLY SO WE'VE DEVELOPED A SWEET IF YOU WELL AND DIGITAL AMBASSADORS- BOTH AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CELEBRITY. HERE WHEN IT AND WHERE IT MAKES SENSE GIVEN OUR H. T. C. TARGETED AUDIENCE- CCD ON OUT ON A LITTLE BIT TO. WHAT WE'RE DOING OR- PERHAPS THAT'S AS FAR AS YOUR QUESTION WELL IT MEANS. THAT IF YOU. I'M THE SUCH INFLUENCE OUR CAMPAIGN IS REALLY COMPRISED OF A COUPLE OF THINGS- ORGANIC- MESSAGING. WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALKING TO THEIR AUDIENCES ON THEIR OWN BUT ALSO WERE DOING A DIGITAL COMPONENT WHERE WERE BOOSTING THOSE MESSAGES. AND REALLY SERVING THEM OUT INTO THE UNIVERSE THROUGH YOU TO. FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM OF SOCIAL- COMPONENTS. THE IDEA BEHIND IT IS TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO THEIR AUDIENCES AND SHARE INFORMATION M. IN THEIR OWN VOICES- WE DO. HAVE A RANGE. OF I AM. I'LL BE LIKE TO CALL IT I AM. LIKE I. STATEWIDE JUST LIKE OUR PLAN WE HAVE STATE RIDE AND WE HAVE REGIONAL. WE HAVE MICRO. FEEL LIKE A MERE THIS NUMBER ARE SOCIAL INFLUENCE OUR CAMPAIGN. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING SEE A ROLE OUT OVER THE NEXT. I'D SAY NINETY DAYS OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL INFLUENCERS WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS WITH DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT THEY AFFECT IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES- THAT HAVE MESSAGES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THEIR AUDIENCES AND SOME THAT ARE THAT THEIR OWN. PASSIONS I WILL ACTUALLY BE TOMORROW IN PRODUCTION WITH SEVERAL OF OUR- RECENTLY ANNOUNCED I AM SOCIAL INFLUENCERS WHERE THEY ARE ACTUALLY GET TO PICK TOPICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO. KNOW LIKE DANNY TRY HOW HIS IS HELPLESS SO HE'S REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT AND SO WE'LL BE DOING SOME OUT THAT HELP THEM BE UPLIFTING THROUGH SOCIAL. I AM AROUND THAT TOPIC GROUP. THE MEDIA PLAN IS TRY TO IN THIS KIND OF FOLLOWING A ON ON A- THE LAST PANEL BUT WILL A PLAN INCLUDE A STRATEGY TO INFORM HDZ INDIVIDUALS OF THE LOCATIONS OF A- THE QUACKS AND CRACKS IN YOUR THAT- ESPECIALLY. AT ARE YES AND IN PARTICULAR WITH THOSE WITH LIMITED ROCK BANDS OF DEMI BOTH. ONLINE AND OFFLINE THING MOST OF THAT DONE THROUGHOUT MY CAR MEDIA PLANS AND ACTUALLY FROM THAT COUNTIES AND- THAT THAT THAT WERE SAYING THAT ARE DOING MEDIA WERE SAYING THAT IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS. WHERE THERE'S THING THE DOLLARS TO BE OUT SUPPORT THAT THAT IT'S A REAL TARGETED MESSAGE COMING FROM THAT COMMUNITY AND THAT REGION ITSELF CONSERVE. RADIOS ALSO. AN EXCELLENT MEDIUM IN WHICH WE CAN- CHANGE OUT SCRIPTS. HE JUST IN THE DIGITAL SO I'M AS WE AS WE GET CLOSER TO WHEN THE FACTS ARE DEPLOYED INNOCENCE IS UNDER WAY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY CUSTOMIZE THOSE MESSAGES IN ANY GIVEN GEOGRAPHIC AREA. SAY VISIT YOUR LIBRARY AND- AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER STREET- IF WE FEEL LIKE THAT STRATEGIES NECESSARY TO READ. ABOUT GREAT. I'M CENTER CABALLERO DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ONE ASK. MY I AM I HAD AN INTERNATIONAL. IT'S DELEGATION NO NO ASIAN AND SO I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I COULD I COULD TELL THEM TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER I WAS DONE SO MY APOLOGIES I MISSED MOST OF EVERYTHING SO I APOLOGIZE IF I'M AND I'M ASKING YOUR EAT IT UP AND MY CONCERN IS THIS CENTER ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF MY DISTRICT IS THERE AND OF A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE- THAT ARE GOING TO BE HARD TO- TO TRACK- NUMBER ONE IS ON A- HOW DO YOU YEAH BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT STATEWIDE RECALL IN THESE MICRO REGION'S IT WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY BE CONSIDERED A MICRO REGION OR WOULD IT BE- AB A REGION. SO OUR MICRO REGIONAL. ERROR THE STATE. SO THIS CENTRAL VALLEY COMPRISES TWO REGIONS FOUR AND SIX AND SO WE HAVE MEDIA LEADS AND IN EACH OF THOSE REGIONS JUST AS WE DO ACROSS EACH OF THE TEN WHO ARE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL PARTNERS ON THE GROUND- AS WE SPEAK TO EXECUTE A VERY CUSTOMIZED MEDIA APPROACH IN IN YOUR REGION OKAY AND THAT'S GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY OF THE AREAS THANK YOU YOUR BOX IS. THEIR MAIL. AND ARE THERE LANGUAGE ISSUES AS WELL AND THEN. OBVIOUSLY THE- UNDOCUMENTED- ISSUE BOB WE'VE GONE OUT AND TOLD THEM YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THE DOOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND- HIMSELF. IT SOMEBODY COMES TO YOUR HOUSE AND NOBODY TALKED TO THEM RIGHT AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WE GO UPS AND THROW THAT THE WINDOW AND WE WANT. TO TALK WE WANT YOU TO HAVE INFORMATION- KILLER EARLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION AT ALL AND SO I'M I'M CA. WHAT MEANING COMPLIANCE GOING TO BE AND HOW WEEKEND COME ALONG SIDE WITH WHATEVER THE COMMUNICATION PLUS IS- TO. YOU KNOW THE BEST COUNTING GET THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO. STANDPOINT THAT ADDRESS THAT CONCERN THAT WE'VE- THAT WE'VE WORKED TO. TO DEVELOP IN OUR CREATIVE IS ONE IS REMINDING PEOPLE THAT THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IS NOT ONE OF THE NINE QUESTIONS ON THE CENSUS. RIGHT AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A TOUCH POINT FOR THE COMMUNITY IT'S VERY THAT HAVE BUT BECAUSE IT WAS SO. USING THAT WAS BEING DEBATED NATIONALLY WE WANT. A REINFORCING THERE IS NO CITIZENSHIP QUESTION AND JUST BEING REALLY BLATANT ABOUT IT. AND THEN THE SECOND I WOULD SAY TO ADDRESS. WHAT YOU JUST. IS TO THE THAT IF YOU DON'T FILL OUT YOUR SINCE THIS TIME WE ARE IS THE- CHANCE THAT ANY RATE COME TO YOUR DOOR TO ASSIST YOU IN AND- IN SOME COMMUNITIES THAT. BIGGER IS EVEN GREATER FEAR. POPS PARTICIPATING IN THE FOR PLACE SO SEEING THAT IN SOME OF OUR FOCUSED. WHERE PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING THAT IF THEY THINK SOMEONE'S GOING TO COME TO THEIR DOOR THERE MOLD MORMON MOTIVATED TO RESPOND IN THE EARLY PART OF THE SENSES WHICH IS. WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. EARLY RESPONSE THAT'S GREAT. SO IS SO IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO GET A COPY OF WHAT YOU'RE COMMUNITY. COMMUNICATION PLAN IS SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO. BE MESSAGING THE SAME KINDS OF INFORMATION- BOTH IT. IS OF OUR OUR THE- TWO WHERE THEY TRACK ENTERS BETTER ALSO OURSELVES- I'M- I WANT TO. PARTICIPATE IN. IN A COUPLE OF. THINGS WERE I WILL BE OUT AS AT. TRUSTED PERSON IN THE COMMUNITY AND- BETTER I THINK IF I. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF DEALING WITH THAT RIGHT UP FRONT IT'S NOT GONNA BE ASKED ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND IT WAS. WAS PURPOSELY INTENDED DID NOT HAVE YOU PARTICIPATE WE NEED YOU TO PARTICIPATE KIND OF THING SURE ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT OF OUR AND CREATIVE AND EVEN WITH THINGS LIKE RADIO SCRIPTS ARE BEING SHARED BY OUR PARTNER PORTAL YOU MIGHT REMEMBER WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT LAST TIME I THINK. WE PARTNER PORTAL IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR WEBSITE ARE ARE ACTUALLY FOURTEEN WEBSITES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE- THE- SITE ITSELF IN THIRTEEN LANGUAGES PLUS THE PARTNER PORTAL WHAT WE'RE HEARING A LOT ABOUT THAT. THIS YEAR'S ONE. HE YOU'RE A POOR FOR THE PARTNERS BE ABLE TO ACCESS MILLION. BOB EXACT AND ALSO SHARE. SO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT ONLY DOWNLOADING THINGS LIKE COLLATERAL MATERIALS AS WELL FOR DISTRIBUTION BUT THEY CAN UPLOAD. THEIR OWN MATERIALS IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S WORKING WELL IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY THAT MAYBE ANOTHER COMMUNITY COULD BENEFIT FROM. OKAY THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW YES THAT I HAD NOT HEARD THAT AND I PART OF THE CHALLENGES I'VE GOT- DE. THREE DIFFERENT WE- IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT AND SO. YEAH I HEARD FROM ALL OF THEM BUT THEY PROBABLY SHOULD CHECK AND JUST MAKE. I'M GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION SIR. AND LOOKING TO SEE. I THINK THE I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAD FOR RIGHT NOW. THE BILL WOULD MAKE PEATED THE BIG PIECES THE COMMUNICATION PLAN SO THAT WE CAN COORDINATE OUR EFFORTS YEAH AND I TOTALLY AGREE AND WE'RE ALL GONNA YOU KNOW I I'M REALLY ENCOURAGING ALL MY COLLEAGUES AND I WAS OUT. SIDE UNITY IS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE CREATE YOUR OWN SENSES EVENTS TO GO. TO OTHER SENSES EVENTS THAT THAT ARE ALREADY HAPPENING. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE RIGHT TALKING POINTS THAT ARE GONNA RESONATE IN A POSITIVE WAY- AS IT WAS ACCIDENTALLY SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY. BACK AND- LOVE TO BE THE BENEFICIARIES OF. HIS GROUPS AND AN- INCOMING MESSAGE AS IN THE DONE. WILL BE GREAT- SO AGO KIND OF. TECHNICAL C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. I CAN&lt;/c&gt;</u> YOU EXPLAIN WHAT. FIVE THIS. ASSISTANCE FOR OUR PARTNERS SO THAT THEY'LL KNOW WHEN THEY ARE BEING BUILT FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SURE I THINK THAT WORD HAS DIFFERENT MEANINGS BUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IT IS. QUITE LITERALLY THE SUPPORT WE CAN OFFER AS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS YES. I TO SUPPORT AND BE A PLANNED SO ACTUALLY BUILDING THE PLAN IN EXECUTING IT WOULD BE ONE EXAMPLE MEDIA TRAINING. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER BE ANOTHER- AND FRANKLY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ALSO HAS A TENDENCY. IN A GOOD WAY TO HELP BUILD CAPACITY OF A SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS WHO MIGHT NOT RESOURCES FOR AND IT'S- MANY. BASHER SO. I ONE OF THE THAT IS THAT THAT IS. ME AT DOLLARS. I CAN CAN BE. PUT INTO THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TECHNICIAN BUT IT COMES IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT FORMS GOSH. GOSH I'M GOING TO READ SO MEDIA. ABSOLUTELY BO SINCE FOR INSTANCE TECHNICAL. ASSISTANCE GOSH BUT IN TOGETHER WEAPON ARE YOU KNOW JOINT SUPPORT TO COMMUNICATION SUPPORT. AND THROUGH THE SNOW SO JUST SO I UNDERSTAND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- IS. EACH ONE OF THE REGION'S HAS A BUDGET WITH YOU AND THEN- THE KINDS OF THINGS THEY'D BE BILL FOR IS THE TRAINING SO THAT THE STAFF. MORE SAT AND HOW THE HOW DO YOU UTILIZE THE MEDIA YEAH COULD BE OKAY BEING AS A WHOLE THAT SO MAYBE. OR POTENTIAL. PERSON SO THAT HOW TO MAYBE. AT A DEAL WITH MY AT WITH THEIR OF FROM REALLY TALK POINTS OUT MASS DEVELOPMENT ALL ALL OF THOSE FOR INTO THE TECH ASSISTANCE AND I HE LIKE IN OUR IN RE SEVEN SOMETHING WHEN EMPIRE YOU KNOW THERE WOULD THE ATV- WAS WORKING WITH LIKE EIGHTY PLUS BBO MOST HAVE MEDICATION. WORRY BUT I HOPE. WE'LL BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE THOSE OF A ISSUES THAT THEY WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMMUNICATIONS WORK THE P. R. MEDIA RELATIONS SO ARE HAVE YOU CREATED LIKE GOOD. FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD A DASHBOARD OF THE KINDS OF CONTINUE YEAH THAT THEY THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS YOU ASKED A- SEND OUT I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO THEY MAKE THE DECISION USE OF THEIR BUDGET IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU COULD PROVIDE AND THEN IT MAY BE THAT SENDING DOWN TO ALL THE EIGHTY. FORGET. THE MANY WOULD ALSO DO THE WORKS IN PRAGUE IS WHERE WE ARE TALKED DIRECT TO THE CBO SAID OUR IN THE REGION AND IF YOU WANT TO YEAH I'M THAT THAT IS THE ACT THE WAY FOUND AS BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S MAY STUFF AS WERE HAVING CALLED WERE WORKSHOPS PAYING THEIR SHARE OF THINGS THEY LIKE OR DON'T LIKE THINGS THEY WANT WE'RE TALKING ON THE PHONE OUT IDEA. RIGHT IT YES SHARING THEM WHERE WE ANALYSIS ON THE STATE AND THE US CENSUS BUREAU CAMPAIGNS TO SEE WHERE MAYBE WERE MISSING FOR SPECIFIC THING I READ. I'M THEN I. BACK TO THEM SOME OF THEM ARE COMING. ALL OF THEM ARE COMING WITH THE WAY LIST. THINGS AND THEN WE LIKE JUST. CALL COME UP WITH A SOLUTION ON HOW HOW TO PROCEED NEXT EVERY REGION IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT SOME OF THE REGIONS ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED AND SUMMER LIKE WE DON'T HAVE TIME CAN YOU. BE MORE HANDS ON SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THEIR NEEDS AND IN SOME CASES WERE PROBABLY NOT MOVING AS FAST AS WE CAN BECAUSE WERE. TRYING TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S OUT A LEVELS AT THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME INFORMATION- AND IN OTHER WAYS. PROBABLY MOVE THE REGION'S WE MAY BE MOVING STAR THAN- THAN OTHERS. I'M IT ROOM AND- THE AN APP XIN AND WE ARE CLOSE HAVING THE MICRO MEDIA PLANS FINALIZED ARE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ALL THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANT DOLLARS ASSIGNED WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS THEY MAY NOT KNOW WHAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY NEED. SO WE'RE PLANNING THE MEDIAN DOLLARS AND WE'RE KEEPING 10% RECOMMENDING SUMMER CHOOSING TO DO MORE- BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL LIKE THEY MIGHT NEED IT THERE. AND SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO BE- CUT SOME TO THE REGION. IN CYNICAL WHERE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE EARLIER NORTH THROUGH. AN ACT. NON RESPONSE FOR UP. YEAH THANK YOU. JUNE AND JULY. SORRY SO IF I COULD MAKE THIS A BECAUSE YOUR APPS RIGHT I WHEN I WAS GETTING TO IS THAT SOME AREAS ARE MORE SOPHISTICATED AND OTHERS AND SOME- SOME OF THE COMMUNITY GROUPS THE REASON THAT THEY BEEN CHOSEN IS BECAUSE THEY AREN'T THIS UNIT IN THERE GOING OUT IN THERE TALKING PEERS AND WE YOU EL MANY HARD ACCOUNT. INDIVIDUALS ON. AND I NEED SOMEONE TO SPEAK THEIR IN THAT LOOK LIKE THEM THAT WILL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH ALL OF THAT AND SO- AT MY SUGGESTION I'M BECAUSE- I KNOW YOU'LL FIND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE BUT WE ALL ARE YOU INTERESTED REGION'S WE- IS THAT- IS KIND OF A- HAD A REPORT CARD BUT JUST SOMETHING THAT TELLS YOU BY REGION HERE. WHAT THE BASS WERE HERE'S WHAT WE'VE DONE AND IN IT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FANCY JUST HAS TO BE. AT LEAST A SOME INFORMATION- IS SO THAT IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU KNOW IN MY DISTRICT WHAT KIND OF TRAINING HAVE YOU DONE YOU'VE GOT A LIST FOR YOU CAN LOOK AT IT VERY QUICKLY SAY WE DID THIS THIS AND THIS AND IF. I DO. THEY IT OVER. AND GIVEN HOW MANY DISTRICTS ARE ARE CALIFORNIA'S REALLY COMPLICATED YES AND EVERY REGION IS REALLY DIFFERENT- SO IT IS THAT THE KINDS OF THINGS IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S EVERYBODY GOT EQUAL IT JUST REALLY IS IN A WORK- BUT BUT IF THERE HAVE BEEN THESE CONVERSATIONS AND THERE'S A WAIT THE TO DOCUMENT HERE'S WHAT DONE IN IN THESE BINS I IT MIGHT HELP TO ALLOW SOME OF THE TURN THE PEOPLE BECAUSE- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. ALL I HAVE SEEN LOT ABOUT THE CENSUS BUT I MAY I MAY JUST HAVE MISSED WHEN THEY COME ON- WHERE WHERE THEY'RE BEING SHOWN AND SO- I GET PARANOID ABOUT IT AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WE GET AN ACCURATE COUNT. SO ANYWAY I CAN BE HELPFUL I WANT TO DO THAT JUST SO LEAVING A YOUR CONCERNS I AM WE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU CAME AND THEN. IT IS GOING TO BE A PART TO ANTHONY I.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON A MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CENTER CERAM SANTANA I'M WITH- CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. AND WE ARE A COMMUNITY BASED CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN SAN FRANCISCO'S CHINATOWN. AND SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE WE'VE WORKED ON EVERY DECENNIAL CENSUS FOR THE PAST FIVE DECADES. FIRST WE WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS STAFF FOR THE COMMITTEE IT'S SHOWN UP FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS THAT MISTREATED IN EVERY LAST YEAR SO THANK YOU. I'M GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE HAPPENED WHAT LYNN WAS PROFICIENT COMMUNITIES MODEL COMMUNITIES UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS- THERE ARE WE DOWN TO YOU KNOW. WE KNOW THERE'S ABOUT A NINETY DAYS UNTIL APRIL FIRST. AND TO GIVEN THE EXISTING EFFORTS THAT ARE STILL BEING CONDUCTED BY STATE CENSUS AT THE MERCURY- THERE ARE THREE KEY THINGS THAT I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE BENEFIT FROM. SO WHAT. LANGUAGE PLAN AND MEDIA REACHED THESE THREE THINGS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. ONE THEY SHOULD TRACK. THE DOLLAR. THE LANGUAGE GROUP. IMPORTANT IT'S- A- WHAT'S RESOURCE. ARE GOING TO BE TO PLAY. FOR WHICH SPUR. ELLIE P. GROUP. AND NOT ONLY TRACK IT BUT HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING SPENT ON WHICH LANGUAGE GROUP. IN WHAT RATE OF THE TEN REGION'S. TO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PRIORITIZE THE MEDIA CONTRACTS FOR NON ENGLISH LANGUAGES THEIR LATEST REPORT THAT CAME OUT JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH STATES THAT THE MEDIA COMPLETE THE ETHNIC MEDIA COMPONENT. IS CORE TO THERE ARE PAID MEDIA PLAN AND IF IT IS COR WE BELIEVE AT LEAST 75% OF THE DOLLARS FOR. CONTRACTS BE MARKED AS MEET. ALSO FOR A HOLDERS KNOW WHAT LANGUAGE THOSE ME BUYS WILL BE MADE. WHAT LANGUAGES WILL LEFT BE LEFT OUT WHY ARE THEY LEFT OUT AND WHO ARE GOING TO FILL THOSE GAPS AT THAT POINT REAL QUICKLY THIRD POINT REALLY QUICKLY WITH. YOUR TIES THE MINORITY THE LINGUISTICALLY SMALL GROUPS FOR MEDIA OUTREACH I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE THIRTEEN LANGUAGES THEY'RE GONNA BE DEPLOYED THE MEAT AND YOU KNOW THE MARKETING IN THE THIRTEEN. WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE OF THE KEY LANGUAGES IN CALIFORNIA THAT AREN'T SUPPORTED THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI JULIAN IRWIN POLICY FELLOW FOR ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIA- JUST WANT TO POINT OUT WALL SOME IN LANGUAGE CENSUS MATERIALS ARE BEING DEVELOPED A TRANSLATED FOR OUT REACH POINT PURPOSES. THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE MATERIALS IN PHYSICAL FORM. SO THERE HAVE BEEN GREAT EFFORTS TO INCORPORATE NON MANDATORY LANGUAGES AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATE PRO ACTIVELY PUSHING REGIONAL A CBO'S TO SHARE OUR RESOURCES AND SEE GRANT OR STIPE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO REACH THE SMALL GROUPS TO THE EXTENT THE STATE IS RELYING ON STATEWIDE HE DOES LIKE A DANCING IS UP I AND CARE. THESE LANGUAGE NEED. IT'S CHALLENGING FUNDING FOR HOLD OFFICE. I THINK MEDIA IS THE CORE THE PAY MEDIA STAR. AS SUCH WE ADVOCATE THAT 75% OF FUNDS DESIGNATED FOR MEDIA CONTRACT SHOULD BE EARMARKED FOR NON ENGLISH LANGUAGES. WE SHOULD KNOW WHICH LANGUAGES THERE WILL BE MEDIA PURCHASES IN AND HOW MUCH IS BEING SPENT ON THAT WHAT LANGUAGES ARE BEING LEFT OUT OF THE MEDIA PURCHASES AND WHY. FINALLY THERE SHOULD BE A FORMAL PLAN FOR MEDIA OUT REACH TO THE SMALLER LINGUISTIC LANGUAGE GROUPS THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE STATE'S MANDATORY LANGUAGES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CO CHAIRS AND MEMBERS ANDREA RIVERA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER I'M HERE TODAY TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE- BY CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE- FIRST TO PRIORITIZE- MEDIA OUTRAGE FOR LINGUISTIC LINGUISTIC MINORITY GROUPS SECOND TO PRIORITIZE OUT REACH OR MEDIA CONTRACTS FOR NON ENGLISH LANGUAGE GROUPS. AND FINALLY ENSURING THAT WE TRACK THE DOLLARS THAT ARE SPENT ON OR WILL BE SPENT ON- OUT REACH PLANS- FOR THESE HARD TO REACH GROUPS- AGAIN ENSURING THAT ALL THESE THINGS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL LANGUAGE ACCESS AND MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS PLANS WILL ENSURE THAT WE CAN COLLECT INFORMATION THAT IS TRULY REPRESENTATIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE POPULATION.

MUCH OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON TRANSPARENCY AND THAT'S VERY HERE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD BE LEFT BELIEVE WILL HELP IN THAT PROCESS.
