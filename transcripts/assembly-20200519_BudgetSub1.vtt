00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:13.004
PARTICIPATION IN MEDI CAL

00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:15.073
DURING THE TERM OF THE PUBLIC

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:17.075
HEALTH EMERGENCY. BUT ANOTHER

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:20.545
KEY- REASON WHY THE FEDERAL

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:21.846
FUNDS ARE GOING UP IS BECAUSE

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:23.214
OF THE RECENT FEDERAL APPROVAL

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:24.916
THE MAN CARE ORGANIZED ATTACKS

00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:29.120
THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. AND

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:32.223
AT MS TOP DOES PROVIDE GENERAL

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.659
FUND RELIEF BUT ALSO GENTLY.

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:36.794
FEDERAL IS. KEEP I WOULD LIKE

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:38.263
MAKE ABOUT FUNDS IS AS YOU SEE

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:41.432
IT'S THAT THE THAT THE BUDGET

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:43.434
TO IS ABLE TO BALANCE TO A

00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:45.069
LARGE DEGREE BECAUSE OF THE

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:47.272
INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING BUT

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:48.873
THE FEDERAL FUNDING DOES NOT

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.842
LAST THE FEDERAL FUNDING TO

00:31:50.908 --> 00:31:53.311
LAST FOREVER. AND IF I BACK TO

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:54.746
THE TO THE TO THE GREAT

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.881
RECESSION- THERE WAS ALSO

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:59.817
ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDING- AS A

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:00.551
RESULT OF THE ARE OF

00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:02.053
LEGISLATION THE FEDERAL

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.988
ECONOMIC STIMULUS LEGISLATION

00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:05.657
THAT ACTUALLY WHY TO. ABOUT

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:08.293
ELEVEN POINT 6%PERCENTAGE

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:11.195
POINT INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:14.265
PARTICIPATION CAL NOT LASTED

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:16.034
FOR. TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.304
THAT AFTER THE FUNDING. ON THE

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.904
WAS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY BIG GUY

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:21.606
IN THE MEDI CAL ANOTHER BUDGETS

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:24.275
AND NOT HAVE TO BE. ADDRESSED

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:25.610
BY FOR SOME FAIRLY MAJOR BUDGET

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:27.912
QUESTIONS SO THE POINT HERE IS

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:30.214
THAT- WHAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING

00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:32.016
CERTAINLY. TODAY IT WILL LAST

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:33.818
FOREVER AND NOT SEE IT IS VERY

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:34.819
IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:37.588
TO CONSIDER SORT OF ON GOING

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:39.290
BUDGET SOLUTIONS- THAT WILL

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:41.659
HELP TO MITIGATE A BIG FUNDING

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:44.862
DROP IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS WHEN

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:47.231

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:15.493
CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.129
BETWEEN MAY AND RESTRICT BRAND

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:22.467

MEDI CAL BUDGET STARTS AT

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:55.733
ROUGHLY JUST OF THE WONDER

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.301
TWELVE THE SIX BILLION DOLLARS

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:59.937
AND TO PROJECT TO MAY THE FIRST

00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:02.874
THING THAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.609
THIS A DISCRETION. WAS WERE

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:06.444

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:11.849
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:14.786
THE VERY ONE THE DELAY OF THE

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:16.954
COW AND PROPOSAL THAT WAS

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:18.456

VERY STE. AND SERVE AT COSTS.

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:23.594
AND THE FIRST ADDED COST IS

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:26.397
HIGHER PROJECTED CASELOAD- IN

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:28.099
MEDI CAL WHICH YOU'LL SEE IS

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:30.868
CLOSE TO. CLOSE TO THREE THREE

00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:33.571
BILLION DOLLARS ON WHICH IS

00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:35.440
VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN THAT

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:38.142
CASE LOAD IS THAT REFLECT. THE

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:40.711

ON CASELOAD. I JUST LIKE TO

00:34:42.513 --> 00:34:43.714
POINT OUT HERE AND IT'S

00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:44.715
SOMETHING OUR OFFICE IS

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:47.819
CERTAINLY A VALUE WAITING- IN

00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:49.520
AN IN DEPTH WAY IS. ARE THE

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.856
GOVERNOR'S CASE LOW PROJECTIONS

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:55.026
FOR FROM CAL AND OUR POOL AREA

00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:57.295
ANALYSIS FINDS THAT WE ARE IN

00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:59.564
GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.832
ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF THE

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:03.968
NUMBER OF NEW. ARE MEDIC ROWLY

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:05.903
THAT WILL COME ON BOARD AS A

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.205
RESULT OF THE OF THE PANDEMIC

00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:09.707
BUT WE'RE DIFFERS DEFINITELY IS

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:12.343
IN THE COST OF THAT NEW

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.913
CASELOAD AND- WE'RE NOT

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.616
EVALUATING WITH MINISTRATIONS.

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:22.253
ASSUMPTIONS AND DO THINK IT IS

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.224
THAT HAS BEEN HAVE BEEN RE UP

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.759
OVER. AND RISING JUST LOOK FOR

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:31.629
ALL. HAVE SOME RIGHT COSTA.

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:33.865
WORD NOT FRONT. CAN YOU SEE IS

00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:36.901
THE TO AND NOT IS A REPAIR OF-

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:38.569
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:40.705
CLAIMING FOR MEDICAL SERVICES

00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:43.441
THAT THAT APPEAR TO BE SERVE

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:46.077
IMPROPERLY CLAIMED AS A RESULT

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:49.280
OF. THE A CLICK CLAIMS NOT HAVE

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:50.948
ELIGIBILITY FOR THE MEDICAL

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:53.751
SERVICES THAT'S ONE POINT FOUR

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.787
BILLION DOLLAR ADJUSTMENT. AND

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:57.855
IT REFLECTS THE WE FIVE TO

00:35:57.922 --> 00:36:00.157
SEVEN YEARS OF THIS IT CLAIMING

00:36:00.224 --> 00:36:02.326
BUT ALSO AS A PERSPECTIVE.

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:03.861
ELEMENT TO THIS AS WELL AND

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:05.696
THEY BUDGET GOING FORWARD

00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:07.632
REFLECTS A JUDGE ADJUSTMENTS TO

00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:11.102
MAKE SURE THAT THE- THE CLIP IS

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:13.037
PROPER. THEN MOVING ON TO SOME

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:15.473
OF THE SAVINGS TIED YOU'LL SEE.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.174
SOME OF THE BIG TICKET ITEMS OF

THE ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDING IN

00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:19.877
THE ROLE THAT THAT PLAYS THE

00:36:19.944 --> 00:36:22.380
ROLE THAT HE- MCO TAX PLAYS IN

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:23.548
TERMS OF REDUCING THE GENERAL

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:26.117
FUND- AND THEN YOU'LL SEE

00:36:26.183 --> 00:36:29.120
NUMBER OF THE BUDGET SOLUTIONS.

00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:29.887
THAT WERE PROPOSED BY THE

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:33.391
GOVERNOR. OKAY ABOUT LATER AND

GENERAL FUND BUDGET AT THAT

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.631
JUST A LITTLE OVER TWENTY THREE

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:42.833
BILLION DOLLARS IN. IN MAY SO A

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.202
LOT OF COMPLEXITIES- SERVE ON

00:36:45.269 --> 00:36:46.904
THE PLUS THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:49.206
THIS PROVIDE USER THE GENERAL-

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:52.877
OVERVIEW OF THE- THE GENERAL

ARE IN MAY- ACROSS HEALTH

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.359
PROGRAMS AND FOR THE MOST PART

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:09.727
BE THE DISCRETIONARY THE BIG

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:12.463
DISCRETIONARY PROPOSALS IN IN

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:13.531
JANUARY WERE HAVE BEEN

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:17.134
WITHDRAWN AT THAT- AT MAY. NOT

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:18.235
LIKE TO JUST START ABOUT WHAT

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:22.440
WAS RETAIN AT AT NAY. AND THE

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.742
CHART HIGHLIGHTS THE- ON PAGE

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:28.346
FIVE THE MAJOR PROPOSALS THAT

THERE THERE ARE OTHERS I SHOULD

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:33.884
NOTE AND- A LOT OF SMALL LITTLE

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:35.820
PROPOSALS THAT. HAVE BEEN

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:37.388
RETAINED SO PROBABLY THE TOTAL

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:38.656
AMOUNT THAT'S RETAIN CERTAIN IS

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:40.424
OVER SIX MILLION OR SO BUT THIS

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:43.160
LESS THE MAJOR. WE WILL SEE

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:45.563
THEIR THEY'RE FAIRLY SMALL IN-

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:50.368
IN IN SIZE. TURNING TO- PAGE

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:51.802
SIX OF THE THEY HAND OUT YOU'LL

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:53.237
SEE THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:54.605
BEEN WITHDRAWN BY THE GOVERNOR

I'D SAT AT AT MAY REVISION-

00:37:57.808 --> 00:37:59.076
TOTALING JUST A LITTLE UNDER

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:01.579
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS- FOCUS

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:04.882
VERY MUCH MEDI CAL AND- THE

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.050
INDEFINITE DELAY OF THE

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:06.984
CALENDAR PROPOSAL IS THE BIG

00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:09.687
TICKET ITEM- BUT ALSO VERY

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:11.255
SIGNIFICANT IS THE WITHDRAWAL

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.790
OF THE GENERATOR PROPOSED

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:19.096
GOVERNOR. TO FULL SCOPE MEDIC.

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:21.065
AND YOU'LL SEE A SELECTION OF

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.833
OTHER BUT RELATIVELY SMALLER AT

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.101
PROPOSALS THAT WERE ALSO

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:28.806
WITHDRAWN ACCESS AT ME REVISION.

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:33.844
SO THEN OF TURNING TO- PAGE SIX

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:40.918
HERE- SKEWS ME. PAGE. GIVING

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:43.454
SURF PAGE SEVEN OF THE OF THE

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.489
HANDOUT EXCUSE ME OF THERE WERE

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:46.957
A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:49.160
MODIFIED AS WELL AT AT AT MAY

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:51.028
REVISION SO RETAIN TO SOME

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:55.299
DEGREE BUT BUT TO THE THAT THE

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:57.768
SAVINGS OR SAVINGS WERE CREATED

00:38:57.835 --> 00:38:58.903
BY REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:00.604
PROPOSALS ARE SO THESE ARE

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:03.340
SIMPLY A MODEST ACROSS THE

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:06.911
STATE BUDGET- C. AS AGAIN

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:10.147
TOTALING ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:12.016
MILLION DOLLARS. SO PROBABLY OF

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:14.018
MOST INTEREST IS ARE THE BUDGET

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:16.187
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED- BY

ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE HANDOUT

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.861
YOU SEE THIS TOTALS TWO POINT

AN EXAMPLE FOR SO MANY OTHERS

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:17.901
ABOUT BUT LET ABOUT THIS IN THE

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:20.470
IN THE TIME. THE I. P. THAT WE

PROGRAM. AT A TIME WHEN IT'S

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:31.715
CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT REALLY SAFE

00:52:31.781 --> 00:52:33.016
TO BE IN A NURSING HOME OR NOT

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.684

THOUSAND ARE FRAGILE MEDICALLY

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:50.300
FRAGILE SENIORS. IN THE IDEA

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:52.936
BEHIND THIS PROGRAM. IS TO KEEP

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.671
THEM FROM HAVING TO GO INTO A

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:01.311
TIME DEALING WITH THIS CRISIS.

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:03.380

NUTRITION DOWN. AND SOME OF

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.800
THAT- I BELIEVE IF I'M NOT

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:25.902
MISTAKEN IS RELATED TO MEALS ON

00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:27.871

HOME NOW THEY MIGHT END UP IN A

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:45.221
IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY.

00:53:45.288 --> 00:53:46.356

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:41.745
LIKE WE'VE- TAKEN. THIS PLAN

00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:43.146
OFF THE SHELF FROM THE GREAT

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:46.683
SESSION DUST IT OFF AND NOT

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:49.586
LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES WE THE

00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:50.620
LAST TIME WE WE'RE GONNA REPEAT

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:52.422
SOME OF THE SAME THAT WE DID

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:55.425
THE LAST TIME OH. WOW I'VE THE

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:57.293
UNDER MARY SAID THIS IS A-

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:57.761
WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON

00:54:57.827 --> 00:55:01.264
MAINTAINING. THE SAME TIME

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:04.100
WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE ACCESS SO

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:04.701
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE PEOPLE

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:07.370
ELIGIBLE. BUT LESS SERVICES AND

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:09.472
LESS PLACES FOR THEM TO GO AND

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:11.274
THAT DOESN'T THAT FEELS WRONG

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.476
ON ON MANY MANY LEVELS SO LET'S

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.779
TALK ABOUT- SOME THE OPTIONAL

00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:18.381
SERVICES. ADULT DENTAL FOR

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:21.217
EXAMPLE- THAT'S IT THAT'S

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:23.153
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE- YOU KNOW

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:25.355
NIGHT YOU I'M NOT. I'M NOT ONE

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:26.456
WHO'S CONSTANTLY ADVOCATING

00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:28.858
ABOUT DENTISTRY- BUT THIS IS A

00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:30.193
HUGE MISTAKE WE MADE IN THE

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:32.062
LAST RECESSION. AND IT FEELS

00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:33.463
LIKE WE'RE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:35.899
AGAIN- PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.233
COMPLEX DENTAL PROBLEMS ARE

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:37.934
GONNA END UP IN EMERGENCY

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:40.036
ROOMS. AND THAT'S NOT

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.604
NECESSARILY WHERE WE WANT THEM

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:43.339
WHEN YOU COULD ACT WE SAW SOME

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:45.041
OF THEIR PROBLEMS. AFFECT THE

00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:46.509
FACT THAT THERE CONSIDER

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:47.677
OPTIONAL IS ALSO FRUSTRATING

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.446
IT. SEE EVERITT COOP IN THE

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:50.814
YEAR TWO THOUSAND FINALLY YOU

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.414
KNOW MADE THE CORRELATION THE

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.916
MATH IS A PART OF THE HUMAN

00:55:52.982 --> 00:55:55.852
BODY. BUT IT FEELS LIKE. RIGHT

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:56.619
NOW THE MATH DOESN'T MATTER TOO

00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.788
MUCH. AND THEN ALSO WE'RE GOING

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.690
TO WE'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE PUT

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:02.759
PUT THE AFFECTS SERVICES. SO I

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:03.393
GUESS FEET DON'T MATTER ANYMORE

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.029
EITHER AND WHEN USE AND THEN

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:07.764
WE'RE GONNA ELIMINATE THE

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:08.364
DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM WE

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:11.067
HAVE. FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IN

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:13.603
CALIFORNIA TAKING INSULIN. AND

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.672
THOSE DIABETIC BUT THE DIABETES

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:16.706
PREVENTION PROGRAM HASN'T

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:17.874
REALLY GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:21.845
YET 50% OF OUR OUR PUBLIC S-

00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:24.280
PRE DIABETIC WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:25.849
SPEND MONEY ON TREATMENT WE'RE

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:26.916
NOT GONNA SPEND MONEY ON

00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:28.885
PREVENTION. AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:30.019
SPEND MONEY ON PREVENTION FROM

00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:31.988
A DENTAL PERSPECTIVE WE SEE A

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.056
LOT OF DIABETICS HAVE DENTAL

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:35.125
PROBLEMS. WE SEE A LOT OF

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:35.658
DIABETICS WHO HAVE FOOT

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:38.661
PROBLEMS. WOUND CARE IS A BIG

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:41.664
PART OF WHAT A LOT OF DIE BET A

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:43.233
LOT OF PRIDE. PODIATRIST DO FOR

00:56:43.299 --> 00:56:44.467
SOME OF THEIR PATIENTS. THREE

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:47.270
ELIMINATE THAT- SO THAT ALLOW

00:56:47.337 --> 00:56:48.271
THAT TO HAPPEN IN ANOTHER

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:50.673
SETTING BUT WE'RE BASICALLY

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.675
SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA LET

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.711
THIS PROVIDERS DO IT. AND THEN.

00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:56.813
FINALLY A NURSE ANESTHETISTS.

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.681
GONNA LAMINATE THAT PART TO.

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.950
NURSE ANESTHETIST PROVIDE A LOT

00:57:01.017 --> 00:57:02.585
OF ANESTHESIA IN RURAL

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:04.654
CALIFORNIA. BUT WE'RE WE'RE NOT

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:06.189
GONNA LET THEM BE CONSIDERED

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.590
OPTIONAL BENEFIT IF YOUR

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.325
EMPLOYED BY SOMEBODY THAT'S A

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:11.895
DIFFERENT STORY BUT WE'RE- IT

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:13.196
JUST FEELS LIKE THE WHOLE

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:15.532
SERIES WHY WERE MAINTAINING

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:16.533
ELIGIBILITY ORGAN SAY WERE

00:57:16.599 --> 00:57:18.601
ELIGIBLE WE'RE REDUCING ACCESS

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:20.270
ON THE OTHER SIDE AND WE'RE AND

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:22.572
WE'RE DOING THAT- IN WAYS THAT

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.174
IS REALLY. REALLY REALLY

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.776
TRADING. AND I KNOW WE CAN HAVE

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:27.977
A WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT PROP

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:30.180
FIFTY SIX- YOU KNOW IT FEELS

00:57:30.246 --> 00:57:32.448
THAT- THAN THIS ADMINISTRATION

00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:34.317
CARRIES ON WHAT THE BROWN

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:35.919
ADMINISTRATION DOES AND- AND

00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:38.188
REMEMBER. THE REASON PROP FIFTY

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:40.456
SIX EVEN CAME TO BE. IS BECAUSE

00:57:40.523 --> 00:57:42.192
A GROUP OF PEOPLE SAID WE'RE

00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:43.293
FRUSTRATED AND SAID WE NEED THE

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:45.728
MONEY FOR TO PROTECT OUR

00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:47.664
PROVIDER NETWORK. WE'RE JUST

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.165
GETTING TO THE POINT WERE RE RE

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:50.867
RE BUILDING THIS PROVIDER

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:53.102
NETWORK TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:53.636
PEOPLE AND NOW WE'RE GONNA

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:55.405
LITERALLY PULL THE RUG OUT FROM

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:56.539
UNDER THAT. AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:59.075
DECIMATE OUR PROVIDER NETWORK

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:01.678
AND MAYBE. MAYBE THAT'S- HOW I

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:02.478
DON'T KNOW I HOPE THAT'S NOT

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:04.347
THE PLAN BUT THAT'S- THAT'S

00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:05.281
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE DO

00:58:05.348 --> 00:58:09.085
THAT SO. DO I AM CURE- AND I

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:09.686
HOPE THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THE

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:12.989
LA- CAN. AS A DIVE INTO THIS-

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:16.726
AS WE LOOK AT THE- AS AT THE

00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:17.994
NUMBERS A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:19.462
LA OWES PROJECTIONS AND THE

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:21.130
GOVERNOR'S PROJECTIONS. ARE ARE

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:23.266
ARE CAUSING A LOT OF CONFUSION

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.167
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THE

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:27.871
ANSWER THERE. SOME OF THE-

00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:30.139
QUESTIONS ABOUT. HOW MUCH OF

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:32.475
THE POPULATION OF THE MEDICARE

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:33.643
POPULATION IS GOING TO BE AT

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.144
THE FIFTY PERCENT.

00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:36.312
REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDS AND

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:37.947
HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BE AT THE

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:39.282
90% REIMBURSEMENT WE DON'T

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:40.850
REALLY KNOW THAT. AND MAYBE

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:41.885
THAT'S MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:44.854
THERE THAT THAT'S LEADING TO.

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:45.455
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE TWO.

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:48.691
BETWEEN THE TWO. A PROJECTIONS.

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:50.593
SO I COULD GO ON I'M I'M SORRY

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.928
I'M A LITTLE I'M A LITTLE BIT

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:56.165
ON A ROLL BUT. BUT I JUST YOU

HAMMERS HAMMERS YOU HARD AND

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:10.747
THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT WE DO AND

00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:12.949
IN TIMES OF CRISIS WE HAMEL WE

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.417
HAVE WE HAMMER THOSE WHO CAN

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:16.619
LEAST AFFORD IT. WHO CAN LEAST

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:18.888
PROTECT THEMSELVES. AND HAVE

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.123
THE SMALL AND HAVE THE SMALLEST

WE RESPECT OUR ELDERS. WE'RE

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:45.415
HERE BECAUSE OF OUR ELDERS OUR

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:48.084
ELDERS WERE. OUR BENEFACTOR ONE

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:51.888
TIME AND SO WE PUT THEM ON A

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:52.488
SHELF AS MISTER WHAT IS SAID.

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:56.526
AND. BALANCE THE BUDGET ON

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:59.362
THEIR BACKS ALSO. I HAVE AN

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.097
EXPECTATION WHEN I BECOME. IN

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:04.701
THAT POSITION THAT SOCIETY WILL

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.036
HONOR WHAT I'VE DONE. AND

WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN. SUSAN

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.845
DOING HALF. THIS IS TAKING A

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:19.916
POPULATION AND MINIMIZING THEM.

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:22.652
THIS IS WRONG. WE'VE GOT TO BE

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:26.789
ABLE TO. COME TO A CONCLUSION

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:28.024
JUST LIKE MR TING SAID

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:31.761
YESTERDAY'S HEARING. ON THE-

POSSIBILITY OF STAGNATING

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:37.467
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:40.203
REPREHENSIBLE. WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:41.337
AT AND I KNOW WHAT'S MORE ART

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:42.438
THAN SCIENCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.807
ASSUMPTIONS. BUT WE NEED TO BE

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:48.745
ABLE TO. BE A BUSINESS LIKE BUT

BUGS ME. HAD A REALLY REALLY.

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.183
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

COMING FORWARD THE BIGGEST CUTS

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:32.595
ARE TO OUR SENIOR POPULATION

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:33.629

ONE EIGHT FROM THAT ARGUMENT

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:40.970
THAT WE NEED TO BE PROTECTING

IS SOME THAT WE HAVE TO

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.130
STRUGGLE WITH TODAY IT'S NOT

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:09.899
JUST ABOUT. TAKING THAT MONEY

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:11.934
AWAY IT'S ABOUT THE SAFETY AND

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.103

ELDERLY POPULATION AND ONE

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:23.045
THING THAT WE CANNOT OVERLOOK

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:25.147
IS THE FOOD SUBSIDIES THAT WE

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:26.949
GIVE TO OUR TO OUR ELDERS I SEE

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:31.153
HERE'S- THAT DEPEND ON THAT. TO

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.722
SURVIVE EVERY DAY. THIS AIN'T

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:35.758
THAT THE YEN IS ALARMING TO SEE

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.728
NOT ONLY SEE THAT SOME MONEY AS

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:40.763
THEY CAN- AWAY. BUT A LOT. OF

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.499
IT. IT THAT EVERY TIME WE GET

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:44.567
INTO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS.

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.635
THERE'S ALWAYS A LOOK AT OUR

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:48.504
ELDERS IN OTHER POPULATIONS AS

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:50.873
THE FIRST PLACE TO HIT. AND I

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.942
AM JOINING OUR COLLEAGUES TODAY

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:54.377
AND THOSE ARE SPEAKING UP ON

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:55.678
THIS ISSUE. THAT WE NEED TO

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.446
SEND A STRONG MESSAGE BACK

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.014
THAT. IF WE'RE GONNA CUT THE

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:01.951
BUDGET THAT SENIOR POPULATION

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:03.652
IS NOT THE TO GO TO START TO

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:06.021
LOOK AT. IT ALSO- MISTER CHAIR

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:07.490
IF I COULD THERE WAS A SPEAKER

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.158
THAT SPOKE THAT TALKED ABOT

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.926
FEDERAL FUNDS BEING IN IN

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.095
JEOPARDY BASED ON CRITERIA

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:14.497
CHANGING I WANTED TO GET A

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:15.998
LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.767
THAT. AND IN PARTICULAR TIED TO

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:18.934
PROGRAM A FLOW THROUGH FROM THE

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.404
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.838
IF WE START CHANGING SOME OF

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.840
THOSE. REQUIREMENTS ARE EVEN

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.542
FOR FEELING THOSE IS NOW THE

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.911
STATE. ON THE HOOK FOR REPAYING

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:30.212
THAT MONEYBACK WHICH IN THE

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.680
END COST MORE MONEY TO THE

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:33.149
STATE. RATHER THAN TAKING OUT

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.518
OF THE BUDGET. MISTER NEWTON

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:36.819
WITH THE LA- DO YOU MIND A

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:37.887
DRESSING THAT QUESTION I

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:39.555
BELIEVE IT'S ON PAGE TWO OF

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:43.859
YOUR HAND UP. YES CERTAINLY-

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:46.095
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- YES

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:48.497
THE ISSUE- CONCERNS THAT

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:50.065
FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT HAS COME

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:53.436
OUT FROM FROM THAT- THE FEDERAL

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:54.837
MINISTRATION RELATED TO THE

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:58.574
FAMILY FIRST TO. FRONT A RELIEF

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:01.010
FOR A VIRUS RELIEF- FIND AND

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:02.745
THE ENHANCED- FEDERAL FUNDING

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:05.281
AND- THE GUIDANCE DOES SUGGEST

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:08.684
THAT TO THAT CHANGES TO- SORT

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.119
OF BENEFIT LEVELS AND

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:12.688
ELIGIBILITY LEVELS. SORT OF

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:16.158
PRIOR- WITHIN SORT OF THE

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.092
TWENTY TWENTY YEAR COULD

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.494
JEOPARDIZE THE FUNDING THE

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:20.863
SCONCES JUST COME OUT AND THAT.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.098
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE- I

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:25.100
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:28.037
RECENTLY. AWARE OF AND- AND

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:29.705
THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:34.743
BUDGET CONTROL SECTION- THAT

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.579
SAID. THAT A CENT STATE THE-

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:37.813
THAT THE- MATTER. QUESTIONS

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.249
THAT WOULD DOT THE LAW OF

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:41.484
JEOPARDIZED OF FEDERAL FUNDS

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.552
THAT WOULD IT WOULD NOT THEN

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:47.356
TAKE A FACTOR SO- BECAUSE-

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:50.092
APPARENTLY IT LOOKS THAT THAT

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:54.864
IF YOU JEOPARDIZE. THE FAT ONES.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:57.333
SMALL SAVINGS ACTION ON THE ON

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.501
THE BENEFIT OR- SIDE PROJECT

01:08:58.567 --> 01:08:59.668
THE WHOLE PLOT OF FUNDING IN

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:00.870
WE'RE TALKING THE BILLIONS

01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:02.538
DOLLARS SO- IT WOULD BE VERY

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:06.008
VERY RISKY TO RESCUE- THE LOSS

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:07.977
OF FEDERAL FUNDS SO. IT IS AN

01:09:08.043 --> 01:09:09.545
ISSUE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:10.913
THE MINISTRATIONS EVALUATING

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.815
WERE EVALUATING AND TURN IT

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:13.716
WILL BE ADVISING THE

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:15.651
LEGISLATURE THAT WE'RE NOT TO

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:17.620
WE'RE NOT TO TAKING SORT OF

01:09:17.686 --> 01:09:19.321
RELATIVELY SMALL THE GENERAL

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:21.690
FUND SAVINGS ACTIONS THAT THAT

01:09:21.757 --> 01:09:23.359
COULD PUT AT RISK- OF THE LARGE

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:25.561
RECEIPT OF FEDERAL FUNDS. THAT

01:09:25.628 --> 01:09:27.129
THAT ESSENTIALLY IS THE ISSUE

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:28.797
BUT BEING FACED. THANK THANK

FEDERAL FLOW THROUGH DOLLARS

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:33.702
AND SOMETIMES WHEN WE START TO

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.004
LOOK TO HAVE A SAVINGS COULD

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:36.839
HAVE THE REVERSE IMPACT BY

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:39.008
COSTING MORE TO THE STATE. THAT

01:09:39.074 --> 01:09:40.476

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.416
YEARS IDENTIFIED- AND THEN WE

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.451
WILL HAVE FUTURE FORWARD OF

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:37.753
ADJUSTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:38.887
ARE APPROPRIATELY CLAIMING

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:40.522
FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SERVICES THAT

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:41.423
DO NOT MEET THE EMERGENCY

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:44.393
SERVICE CRITERIA AVAILABLE FOR

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:48.463
STATE ONLY PROGRAMS. AND I I'M

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.432
HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFF LINE IF

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.935
I CAN FOR- FURTHER DETAIL BUT-

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:55.670
DID JUST WANT TO HEAR THAT

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:59.307
INITIAL EXPLANATION IF I CAN

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:00.809
I'D I DO WANT TO TURN TO.

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:02.511
DURING PLEASE IN THE WITNESS

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:08.183
VIDEO ROOM. AND THAT AND I'M.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.584
I'M REALLY STRUGGLING A BIT

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:11.586
BECAUSE THIS PANDEMIC EVENTS

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:14.122
TAUGHT AT US ANYTHING IS THE

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:16.525
VALUE OF REALLY HAVING A STRONG.

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:17.059
PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AN

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:20.662
INFRASTRUCTURE. IN FACT MUCH OF

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.431
OUR ECONOMIC CRASH IN THE

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.499
RESULTING DEVASTATING CUTS THAT

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:27.269
WE NOW FACE CAN BE DIRECTLY

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:28.970
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WOEFULLY

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:32.974
UNDERFUNDED PUBLIC HEALTH

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.376
THOUGH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:35.710
DEPARTMENTS ARE FACING A

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:37.679
POTENTIAL LOSS OF A HUNDRED AND

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:39.548
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:41.349
REALIGNMENT FUNDING WHICH WILL

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.919
NOT BE BACK FILLED BY FEDERAL.

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:47.322
AID AND SPECIFICALLY. FOR

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.291
COVERT COSTS ON A TEMPORARY

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:52.828
BASIS SO. I GUESS I'M TRYING TO.

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:54.696
UNDERSTAND OF FORGETTING LAST

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:57.099
FUNDING ARE WE INVESTING THE

01:18:57.165 --> 01:19:00.302
NECESSARY RESOURCES TO GET US

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:03.171
READY FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC.

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.639
IT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:06.007
QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK AND I

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:08.410
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- WHILE WE

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:11.713
DO- PLAN AHEAD FOR PANDEMICS I

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.081
THINK WHAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS

01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:18.920
DEMONSTRATED TO US IS THAT.

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:21.056
PREPARING AND PREPARING FOR A

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:22.657
PANDEMIC REQUIRES MUCH MORE

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:23.892
THAN SIMPLY THINKING ABOUT YOUR

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.527
INFECTIOUS DISEASE FREE MARKET

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:28.697
ALSO. TO THE POINT HERE- MEANS

01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:30.966
THAT WE MUST ALSO BE PREPARED

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:33.835
FOR. SONIC DISEASES FOR MENTAL

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:36.104
HEALTH CONCERNS AND FOR ALL OF

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.039
THE OTHER AREAS THAT THAT ANY

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:39.875
KIND OF RESPONSE WOULD REQUIRE

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:40.909
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT REQUIRES

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:43.044
AN ALL OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE.

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.312
SO WHAT I WOULD NOTE HERE IS

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:46.848
THAT INDEED WE MUST CONTINUE TO

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:48.316
FUND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:49.784
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT LET'S ALSO

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.453
NOTE THAT THIS IS ALL OF

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.054
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE AND SO THAT

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:55.023
ACROSS ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.825
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THE

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.393
FRAMING THAT WE HAVE

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.162
INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:02.330
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:05.100
CARE. UP RECEIVE SOCIAL

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:06.701
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. OVER

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.036
TIME ARE ALSO PART OF THE

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:10.238
INVESTMENTS IN MAKING SURE THAT

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.706
WE WILL BE A STRONG STATE IN

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.341
THE FACE OF ANY FURTHER FIFTY

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:14.910
INFECTIOUS DISEASES THESE ARE

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.144
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TIMES IN

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:17.445
THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:19.814
MADE. ARE BY NO MEANS BEING

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:22.317
MADE LIGHTLY- BUT WE ALSO NEED

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:24.419
TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN THESE

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.121
TIMES OF ECONOMIC CHALLENGES

01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:28.056
ALL OF US TOGETHER LET'S THINK

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:29.691
ABOUT HOW ARE DEPARTMENTS IN A

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:32.827
RESOURCES- TOGETHER- CREATE A

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.229
RESPONSE FOR THE CURRENT.

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:35.697
ENVIRONMENT AND FUTURE

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.866
ENVIRONMENT THAT CAN CAN GREAT

FOR IT IN ADVANCE BUT IF. KOBE

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:31.453
NINETEEN IS AN EARTHQUAKE THEN

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:32.887
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE

AND THE UNPRECEDENTED LIMITS ON

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:52.540
OUR STATE'S ABILITY TO HELP.

BE HERE TODAY TO JOIN YOU- I

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.957
THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:09.524
THINGS THAT THE STATE SHOULD

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.526
THINK ABOUT. FIRST IS AS YOU

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:12.661
SAID THAT COUNTIES ARE FACING

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.596
ENORMOUS. ENORMOUS CHALLENGES

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:17.699
RELATED TO BOTH FISCAL ISSUES.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.868
OPERATING REALITIES AND THEN

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:22.203
GROWING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS.

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:25.073
RECOGNIZING THAT NEW FINANCING

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.208
IS REALLY NOT AN OPTION AND

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:28.043
THAT WE ARE IN A PERIOD OF

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:30.245
CUTS. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.813
THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE FISCAL

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.515
INCENTIVES THAT THE STATE IS

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.650
CREATED FOR COUNTIES. RIGHT NOW

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:36.818
ALL THEIR FISCAL INCENTIVES ARE

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:38.787
FOCUSED ON SPENDING DOLLARS

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:41.389
QUICKLY AND WE SHOULD THINK

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:42.057
ABOUT STEPPING BACK FROM THAT A

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:44.993
BIT. IN CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.761
WHERE WE CAN SLOW DOWN SPENDING.

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:48.229
RELATED TO THAT ARE

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.964
OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE GREATER

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:52.634
FLEXIBILITY. IN TERMS OF MANY

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:53.601
OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THE

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:55.103
COMMISSION IMPLANTS ARE LOCAL

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:56.871
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WE'RE

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:58.373
WORKING WITH COUNTIES TO FIND

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.507
PLANS THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:01.343
SOME CASES TWO YEARS AGO IN

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:03.678
SOME CASES SIX MONTHS AGO. FOR

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:04.546
EXAMPLE THE MEDICAL STUDENT

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:06.114
SERVICES ACT NONE OF THOSE

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.516
PLANS WERE DEVELOPED HE AND THE

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:09.918
CURRENT CODE ENVIRONMENT.

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:11.319
WHETHER THAT'S AROUND HOW WE

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:13.321
OPERATE. OR THE ECONOMIC

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:15.590
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN. ANY

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:18.059
OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THE

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:19.394
ABILITY OF STATE AGENCIES TO

01:23:19.461 --> 01:23:21.463
GRANT SOME FLEXIBILITY TO

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:24.232
COUNTIES TO RETHINK PRIORITIES

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.034
RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE TO DO

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:27.669
MORE WITH LESS WOULD BE

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:31.206
IMPORTANT. I WOULD ALSO ADD

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:33.274
THAT THE INNOVATION COMPONENT

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.276
OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:37.112
ACT GIVES US SOME OPPORTUNITIES.

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:39.447
DURING THIS ENVIRONMENT- SOME

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:41.349
OF THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE ASKING

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:42.617
FOR SET ASIDE OF INNOVATION AND

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.386
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT.

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:45.453
AND ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION IS

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.956
NOT ENGAGED ON THIS EXPLICITLY.

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:49.691
IT THE EDUCATION COMPONENT IS

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:51.493
REALLY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:52.494
ABILITY OF COUNTIES TO THINK

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.295
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:55.930
SERVICES NOW MORE THAN EVER

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.665
THAT'S IMPORTANT. WE REALLY

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:58.967
HAVE TO STEP BACK AND THINK

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:01.236
ABOUT HOW WE DO THINGS HOW WE

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.670
MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOWER COSTS

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:04.806
IMPROVE OUTCOMES. AND FOCUS

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:07.075
MORE ON OUTCOMES. I WANT TO

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:09.144
MENTION. PROBABLY THE MOST

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.012
CONCERNING ISSUE FOR THE

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.747
COMMISSION AT THE MOMENT.

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:14.783
AROUND SUICIDE PREVENTION. I

01:24:14.849 --> 01:24:17.352
WANT TO THANK THIS SUBCOMMITTEE

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:18.186
FOR ITS LEADERSHIP OVER THE

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:20.288
LAST FEW YEARS. TO REALLY BRING

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.090
THAT. BRING GREATER ATTENTION

01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:24.392
ON SUICIDE PREVENTION AND THIS

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.059
OTHER NUMBER RAMOS FOR HIS

01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:28.029
LEGISLATION- THAT WAS UP

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:29.531
YESTERDAY THANKS- CHAIR WOULD

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:30.665

COMMITTEE. UP FOR HIS COMMENTS

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.336
ON THAT BILL. THE COMMISSION IS

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:35.904
VERY CONCERNED THAT SUICIDE

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:38.573
PREVENTION. NEEDS ARE MORE

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.109
EVER BEEN BEFORE. ALTHOUGH I'M

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:42.844
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.179
HAPPENING ALL OF THE RESEARCH

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:45.380
SUGGESTS THAT THESE KINDS OF

01:24:45.447 --> 01:24:48.016
CRISES REALLY DRIVE INCREASES.

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:49.918
AND SO SUBTLE RISK AND BEHAVIOR

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:51.653
AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WAYS

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:52.954
THAT THE STATE CAN SUPPORTER OF

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:54.155
LOCAL PARTNERS IN SUICIDE

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:56.024

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:07.869

HELP OUR SENIORS TO LIVE IN THE

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:01.523
COMMUNITY AND TO STAY OUT OF

WHEN I SPOKE WITH DOCTOR ANGEL

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.249
I JUST THINK WE AS THE

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:36.985
LEGISLATURE NEED TO LEAN INTO

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:38.653
OUR- DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.988
HEALTH AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.723
HELP THEM WITH WORKFORCE IN

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:43.224
INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THIS

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:45.860
CRISIS. AND ALLOW US TO BE

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.295
BETTER PREPARED FOR THE NEXT

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:49.497
PANDEMIC. BUT I WANT TO TALK

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:52.867
ABOUT SONG BROWN IF I COULD

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.703
JUST BECAUSE- IT'S DIFFICULT

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.672
WHEN YOU'VE MADE COMMITMENTS TO

01:27:57.739 --> 01:28:00.041
INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.843
DECISIONS BASED ON THOSE

01:28:01.909 --> 01:28:04.912
COMMITMENTS. AND SONG BROWN IS

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:07.048
A PROGRAM THAT WE PROMISED IN

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:09.350
PERPETUITY AND ALLOWED

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:10.885
HOSPITALS TO MAKE CHOICES

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:13.454
REGARDING RESIDENTS. NOW I

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:15.556
WOULD COUNTER AND SAY THAT I DO

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:16.758
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:19.127
ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE PROGRAM

01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:20.828
TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:22.296
INCREASING SLOTS AND

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:24.032
UNDERSERVED AREAS. I WOULD

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:25.967
ENCOURAGE THIS ADMINISTRATION

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:27.402
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTINUE

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:30.138
THAT SOURCE OF FUNDING AS I

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:31.539
CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:32.974
NEED LESS DOCTORS AFTER THIS

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.209
PANDEMIC THAN BEFORE US GOING

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:38.646
INTO IT. NOW THE FINAL ONE IF I

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:40.548
CAN AND WOULD ASK THIS

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:41.582
COMMITTEE JUST TO INDULGE ME

I'VE- NEVER TALKED BOUT THEM

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.653
IN PUBLIC AND JUST WANT TO TELL

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.689
A LITTLE BIT OF A STORY BECAUSE

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:49.424
I THINK SOMETIMES IT.

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:52.226
PERSONALIZES AND REMINDS US

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:54.929
THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST NUMBERS.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.564
HOUSE OF THREE NINE ZACHARIAS

01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.800
WERE MY GRANDPARENTS WHO CAME

01:28:58.866 --> 01:28:59.667
TO THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT

01:28:59.734 --> 01:29:02.036
DOCUMENTS SPENT THEIR WHOLE

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:03.705
LIVES WORKING IN THE FIELD. AND

01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:04.739
THEY WOULD NEVER IMAGINE THAT

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:06.507
THEIR SON AND GRANDSON WOULD

01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:08.076
END UP BEING ON THE LEGISLATURE

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:09.343
AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:11.045
STAND UP AN ADVOCATE FOR

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:13.014
SOMETHING THAT MATTERS TO THE-

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.183
BUT I GOT ACTIVATED TO FIGHT

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:17.051
FOR HEALTH FOR A WHOLE. BECAUSE

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:19.587
I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:20.154
HUMAN RIGHT FOR EVERY SINGLE

01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:23.257
PERSON. AND I ESPECIALLY FIGHT

01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:24.358

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:25.927
REMEMBER MY GRANDPARENTS AND

01:29:25.993 --> 01:29:27.361
THE SACRIFICE THAT THEY MADE

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:30.064
FOR US. AND WOULD ASK THIS

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:32.800
GOVERNOR TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:33.634
AND ANOTHER LOOK AND ANOTHER

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:35.636
LOOK. TO TRY TO MEET HIS

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:39.540
COMMITMENT AT THE START OF THE

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:40.908
SENIORS BECAUSE THROUGH THIS

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:43.478
PANDEMIC I THINK WE SHOULD

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:45.079

POVERTY LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:09.957
THAT'S THESE ARE THESE ARE

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:11.592
SENIOR CENTER REALLY HURTING.

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:15.696
THAT IT THAT'S ELIMINATED- THE

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:16.530
THING WE CALL FLIPPERS THE

01:32:16.597 --> 01:32:18.532
PEOPLE THAT SHE TURNED SIXTY

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:19.433
FIVE AND THEY'RE ON MEDICARE

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.168
THERE THERE MEDI CAL. AND

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:22.603
THEY'RE SUDDENLY THEIR INCOME

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.238
IS TOO HIGH AND THEY FLIP OFF

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:24.972
AND THEN THEY HAVE TO SPEND

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:26.941
DOWN AND RE APPLY AND GO

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:28.676
THROUGH THE CYCLE OVER AND OVER

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:32.847
AND OVER AGAIN- THAT. WAS MEANT

01:32:32.914 --> 01:32:34.282
TO HELP WITH ELIGIBILITY AND

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:37.551
MAINTAIN- EFFICIENCIES AND

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:41.756
THAT. IS BEING. ELIMINATED SO.

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:44.091
I DON'T UNDERSTAND DâN WHY

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:45.626
WERE USING THE BUDGET TO

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:47.828
ELIMINATE POLICY RATHER THAN

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.330
JUST BECAUSE IT UNTIL WE

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:52.066
ACTUALLY HAVE. A REALIZATION OR

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:53.834
YOU KNOW OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:55.937
SO COULD SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY

01:32:56.003 --> 01:32:58.005
YOU'RE ELIMINATING. THE WORK

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.473
THAT WE DID IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.542
RATHER THAN UP HITTING THE

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:14.455
PAUSE BUTTON. EDITOR. TOTALLY

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:17.158
KNOWLEDGE THE THIS SENTIMENT-

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:19.026
AND YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:21.329
WE- DISAGREE WITH WITH THE

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:24.598
SENTIMENT AND A LOT OF WAYS. I

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:25.433
THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT THE

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:26.734
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU KNOW

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:28.269
DIDN'T PROPOSED A PULL BACK A

01:33:28.336 --> 01:33:31.072
LOT OF THESE THINGS IN JANUARY-

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:33.507
WE- DIDN'T WANT TO PULL BACK

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:34.909
OUR OWN PROPOSALS FROM FROM

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:36.877
JANUARY AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.879
A LOT OF THESE BILLS WITH THE-

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.448
INTENTION OF IMPLEMENTING THEM

01:33:40.514 --> 01:33:42.283
OR DEPARTMENTS OF WORKED. TO

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.151
BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THOSE THINGS

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:47.621
AND THE WE HAVE A STRUCTURAL

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:48.823
BUDGET PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:50.791
CREATED BY THIS BUDGET WE ARE

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:52.460
RELYING ON FEDERAL DOLLARS TO

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:56.697
HOPEFULLY- SAVE AND IT KIND OF.

01:33:56.764 --> 01:33:58.332
STAVE OFF SOME OF THESE

01:33:58.399 --> 01:33:59.834
REDUCTIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:02.203
BUT EVEN. THE FEDERAL MONEY

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:04.171
THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR DOES NOT

01:34:04.238 --> 01:34:06.874
ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL ISSUE

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:09.977
THAT'S BEEN CREATED BY- THE

01:34:10.044 --> 01:34:10.778
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE

01:34:10.845 --> 01:34:12.980
FACING. SO WITH THE CERTAINLY

01:34:13.047 --> 01:34:14.849
THE BUDGET PROCESS IS A PLACE

01:34:14.915 --> 01:34:16.951
FOR US TO WORK THESE ISSUES OUT

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:19.220
AND TO GO SHEET THESE THINGS-

01:34:19.286 --> 01:34:20.821
AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:22.023
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:24.658
ALL BUT- CERTAINLY THE

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:27.028
SITUATION THAT WE'RE AND IS.

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:28.629
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT ONE AND WE

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:31.632
EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE FOR

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:33.968
SEVERAL YEARS TO COME. I

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:35.002
APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT BUT

01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:36.937
I THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION I

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:38.606
ASKED IS WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:41.242
HIT PAUSE. ON SOME OF THESE ON

01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:43.911
POLICY THAT THAT WE HAVE ALL

01:34:43.978 --> 01:34:45.846
AGREED UPON RATHER THAN JUST

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:47.715
FLAT OUT ELIMINATING THINGS WE

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:50.284
GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE OKAY-

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:53.120
THE MEDI CAL STATE RECOVERY

01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:53.621
SOMETHING WE'VE YOU KNOW

01:34:53.687 --> 01:34:54.188
SOMETHING THIS LEGISLATURE

01:34:54.255 --> 01:34:56.457
TRIED TO CHANGE FOR YEARS AND-

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:57.591
THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN

01:34:57.658 --> 01:35:00.628
ELIMINATED SO- THE GENERAL FUND

01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:01.695
SAVINGS ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:04.231
DOLLARS. NOW IT THE FEDERAL

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:05.733
MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATE

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.835
THIS BASICALLY MEANS THAT THAT

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:08.669
IF YOU ARE A FAMILY MEMBER-

01:35:08.736 --> 01:35:10.504
THAT THAT SOMEONE MIGHT NOT

01:35:10.571 --> 01:35:12.540
APPLY FOR MEDI CAL BECAUSE THEY

01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:14.141
ARE AFRAID OF LOSING. THEIR

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:17.178
HOME. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:20.781
THAT WE GO BACK AND- IF SOMEONE

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:22.416
HAS A HOME THAT WE CAN GO BACK

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:23.751
AND TAKE ME TAKE THAT TAKE

01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:25.419
MONEY FROM THAT FROM THAT

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:26.887
PROPERTY REPAY THEIR MEDI CAL

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:29.290
BENEFITS OVER THE YEARS. NOW

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:30.825
SOME OF THAT FIT YOU KNOW SOME

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:31.459
OF THAT DEPENDING ON WHAT THE

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:32.326
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:34.562
REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL IS OF SOME

01:35:34.628 --> 01:35:36.597
OF ITS 50% SO WE DO THAT

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:38.432
RECOVER THAT HALF OF THAT GOES

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:39.400
BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:41.469
SOME IS NINETY PERCENT. SO IS

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:43.137
IN ESSENCE WERE BECOMING A

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:44.371
COLLECTION AGENCY FOR THE

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:46.273
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE. AND

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:46.941
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:49.143
POTENTIALLY- PUTTING MORE

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:50.211
PEOPLE INTO A HOMELESS

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:53.013
SITUATION SO I YOU KNOW I

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.448
STRUGGLE WITH SOME OF THESE.

01:35:54.515 --> 01:35:55.249
BUT I GO BACK TO THE

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:57.818
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WHY IS

01:35:57.885 --> 01:36:00.421
THIS BUDGET. I'M DOING POLICY

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:02.156
DECISIONS RATHER THAN HITTING

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:03.724
THE PAUSE BUTTON UNTIL WE

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:06.360
ACTUALLY HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:08.262
TO DO THAT AND NOT THAT'S-

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:11.966
ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW PREVENTION.

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:13.901
FOR DIABETES. WORK WERE KILLING

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:15.102
A PROGRAM THAT JUST HASN'T EVEN

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:17.104
REALLY GOTTEN STARTED YET YEAH

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:18.506
WE'RE GONNA SPEND MILLIONS

01:36:18.572 --> 01:36:20.074
MAYBE EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:21.408
ON THE TREATMENT OF DIABETES

01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:23.511
BUT WE WON'T PREVENT. WE WON'T

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:24.545
WORK ON A PROGRAM TO PREVENT

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:28.215
IT. DO YOU. THAT THIS IS BEYOND

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:30.918
PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH- I

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:32.553
DON'T I TYPE I JUST

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.622
FUNDAMENTALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:36:34.688 --> 01:36:35.823
THE SOME OF THESE DECISIONS

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:37.258
THAT THAT ARE LEARNED WITH

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:39.393
LEADING TO SMALL LINE ITEMS TO

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:41.028
HELP BALANCE OUR BUDGET. ARE

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:42.763
GONNA HAVE HORRIBLE

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.265
RAMIFICATIONS AND POTENTIALLY

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:46.133
COSTS A LOT MORE MONEY IN THE

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.036
FUTURE. DOES ANYBODY MAKE IT

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:50.437
WHO WHO HOW DO THESE DECISIONS

01:36:50.504 --> 01:36:54.008
GET MADE. IN OURS IS- THERE'S A

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:54.575
POT OF MONEY WILL TAKE THAT

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:56.076
WILL TAKE THAT. TO THINK ABOUT

01:36:56.143 --> 01:36:56.911
WHAT THE POTENTIAL

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:58.279
RAMIFICATIONS AND THAT'S WHY I

01:36:58.345 --> 01:37:00.581
SAID EARLY ON IT FEELS LIKE WE

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:02.349
TOOK THE OLD BUDGET PLANT THE

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:03.717
OLD RECESSION PLAN OFF THE

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:05.753
SHELF DUSTED OFF. AND IGNORED

01:37:05.819 --> 01:37:09.056
ALL THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED-

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:11.492
FROM THAT FROM BAD DECISIONS

01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:12.092
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO. DO IT

01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:15.829
AGAIN. AND SO. SO FUNDAMENTALLY

01:37:15.896 --> 01:37:17.831
WHY ARE WE TAKING. ANSWERED YOU

01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:19.166
CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OR IS

01:37:19.233 --> 01:37:20.501
IT JUST JUST THE DIRECTOR TING

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:21.468
WE'RE JUST GONNA UNDUE POLICY

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:23.337
THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT IN

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:23.904
PLACE INSTEAD OF PUTTING ON

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:28.876
HOLD. I THINK THAT WE'RE MORE

01:37:28.943 --> 01:37:30.110
THAN HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:31.378
SUGGESTIONS FROM THE

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:33.647
LEGISLATURE ON ON ON OTHER

01:37:33.714 --> 01:37:36.383
IDEAS FOR HELPING NEIGHBORHOODS

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:38.552
EIGHT EIGHT WHILE. OF THE JAZZ

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:40.221
BUT NOW I THINK WHAT DOCTOR

01:37:40.287 --> 01:37:42.089
WHAT IS SAYING IS APPROPRIATE

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:44.825
AND IF I CAN STEP IN HERE-

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:50.264
LEGISLATION TO WHICH HE'S

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:54.435
REFERENCING. I TOO AM MOVED TO

01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:56.370
FIGURE OUT IF THERE ARE OPTIONS

01:37:56.437 --> 01:37:58.539
THAT WE CAN CONSIDER SIMPLY FOR

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.274
PAUSING RATHER THAN ELIMINATE.

01:38:00.341 --> 01:38:02.343
BECAUSE THAT WILL ALLOW US IF

01:38:02.409 --> 01:38:04.178
BUDGET TIMES CHANGE TO.

01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:07.815

SUPPORT TEND MOMENTUM- WOULD BE

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.628
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE WOULD

01:38:20.694 --> 01:38:22.062

APPROVED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

02:36:49.299 --> 02:36:50.801
UNFORTUNATELY THAT NOTS THE

THIS PROGRAM. ONE OF THE

02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:03.914
CONCERNS THAT WE IS THAT THIS

02:37:03.981 --> 02:37:05.449
IS ONLY JUST FISCAL

02:37:05.516 --> 02:37:06.884
CONSIDERATION BUT THIS SEEMS TO

02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:09.286
BE MORE A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN

02:37:09.353 --> 02:37:11.188
HEALTHCARE POLICY WE BELIEVE

02:37:11.255 --> 02:37:12.422
THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK

02:37:12.489 --> 02:37:13.791
BEYOND THE STATED BOTTOM LINE

02:37:13.857 --> 02:37:15.526
APPROACH AND STATE. TAKE INTO

02:37:15.592 --> 02:37:17.628
CONSIDERATION. THE FACT THAT

02:37:17.694 --> 02:37:19.363
PHARMACY SERVICES INCLUDE.

02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:20.664
ITEMS JUST BIRTH CONTROL

02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:23.600
SMOKING CESSATION VACCINATIONS

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:25.969
AND THIS STARTING THIS YEAR-

02:37:26.036 --> 02:37:28.005
PREP AND PAP COVERAGE. AND IT

02:37:28.071 --> 02:37:31.275
IS DONE SO AT A RATE 15% LESS

02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:33.110
THAN OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:34.144
THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING

02:37:34.211 --> 02:37:36.513
THESE THESE SERVICES. SO THIS

02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:40.651
IS NOT AND- THIS IS A LESS

02:37:40.717 --> 02:37:42.486
EXPENSIVE. BENEFIT TO THE STATE

02:37:42.553 --> 02:37:44.688
THAT'S BEING ELIMINATED- BOB IS

02:37:44.755 --> 02:37:46.590
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ESPECIALLY

02:37:46.657 --> 02:37:47.090
TROUBLING THE MIDDLE THE

02:37:47.157 --> 02:37:49.960

02:37:50.027 --> 02:37:50.427
EXPANDING SERVICES NOT

02:37:50.494 --> 02:37:51.728
ELIMINATING THEM AND I WOULD

02:37:51.795 --> 02:37:53.430
NOTE THAT VACCINATIONS AS I

02:37:53.497 --> 02:37:54.398
MENTIONED WOULD BE SEVERELY

02:37:54.464 --> 02:37:56.366
IMPACTED BY THIS DECISION.

02:37:56.433 --> 02:37:58.335
WHICH WOULD MAKE THIS AND

02:37:58.402 --> 02:37:59.870
FUTURE HEALTH EMERGENCY WORSE.

02:37:59.937 --> 02:38:01.805

THE PUBLIC HEALTH ENTERED THIS

03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:35.551
EPIDEMIC. WE UNDER FUNDED AND

03:06:35.617 --> 03:06:38.887

TO ADDRESS THE CODE NINETEEN

03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:46.929

IF WE DO THAT IT ONLY

03:06:56.905 --> 03:06:59.174
DECREASES. IT INCREASES THE

03:06:59.241 --> 03:07:00.809
DISPARITIES THAT WE CURRENTLY

03:07:00.876 --> 03:07:03.045
HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND AS MANY

03:07:03.111 --> 03:07:05.347

VULNERABLE TO SEPARATE THEM OUT

03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:09.418
AGAIN THE ALL OF THESE

03:07:09.484 --> 03:07:10.118
