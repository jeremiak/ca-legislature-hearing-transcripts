CONFLICT WE COULD ALSO TALK

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.725
ABOUT DUPLICATION. THERE

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.794
POTENTIALLY I'M I'M RETICENT TO

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:47.096
JUST SAY LET'S PUT THIS ON HOLD

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.865
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH FEDERAL

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.133

KICK IT TO THE SPAGHETTI SOUP

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.341

COMMENTS I CERTAINLY WHEN I

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:13.589

EACH OF THOSE AGENCIES PLAY I

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:28.905
DO THINK THERE PROBABLY IS AN

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.540
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SOME

01:03:30.606 --> 01:03:31.507

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:35.211
RATIONALIZATION BEYOND THIS.

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:35.745
BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:37.613
HAVING. AN AUTHORITY THAT IS

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.848
