00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:15.646
WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:18.549
HAVING AN INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:19.417
WOULD BE A BIG ASSET FOR

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:21.586
CALIFORNIA SUCH A SYSTEM IS

00:35:21.652 --> 00:35:24.088
CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE

ACROSS A SEGMENTAL QUESTIONS

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:33.931
THAT COULD BE ANSWERED MORE

00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:36.000
READILY IF OUR EDUCATION DATA

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:37.502
SYSTEMS WERE CONNECTED

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:39.203
INFORMATION THAT CAN BE.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.905
REALLY USEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE

PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:02.360
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WE THINK

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.694
IT MAKES SENSE AS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:05.196
PROPOSED TO START WITH THE CORE

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:07.665
EDUCATION SEGMENTS AND THEN

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:09.100
BUILD INCREMENTALLY FROM THERE.

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:11.736
THAT SAID WE DO HAVE CONCERNS

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:13.337
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:15.706
WE SHARE STAFF CONCERNS RAISED

00:36:15.773 --> 00:36:18.543
IN YOUR AGENDA ABOUT THE LACK OF

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:19.911
REALLY MUCH OF A ROLE AT ALL FOR

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:22.647
THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS PROJECT.

00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:24.081
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:25.583
THE LEGISLATURE'S ONLY ROLE

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.518
WOULD BE UP TO APPROPRIATE THE

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:28.486
MONEY.

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:31.155

00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:34.325
IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:36.627
PROPOSAL PROVIDES AN EX DOES NOT

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:39.797
PROVIDE AN EXPLICIT REQUIREMENT.

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.265
FOR THE STATE TO GO THROUGH THE

ESTABLISHED A PLANNING PROCESS

THE STATE'S A CHECKERED.

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:51.842
PAST WITH IT PROJECTS WE THINK

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:53.477
IT'S RISKY NOT TO USE THE

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.346
ESTABLISHED PROCESS THROUGH THE

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:56.314
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.750
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:01.085
QUITE A BIT OF MONEY FOR

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:03.020

MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND WHO SHOULD

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:07.191
GOVERN IT.

00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:09.293
YET THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.262

TO DEVELOP AND MANAGE THE SYSTEM.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.365
AND THAT WOULD INVOLVE THE THE

WORK GROUP WE THINK A BETTER

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:09.153
APPROACH WOULD BE FOR THE

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.788
LEGISLATURE TO LEVERAGE THESE

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:12.156
PAST EFFORTS.

00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:13.691

REALLY.

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:16.394
BUILD ON WHAT WE'VE ALREADY

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.295
LEARNED AS A STATE.

00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:19.797
SO PAGE EIGHT OF THE BRIEF.

00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:21.298
THAT WE PUT TOGETHER LAYS OUT

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:23.434
SOME RECOMMENDED STEPS FOR THE

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.236
LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION.

00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:25.736
AND THE PURPOSE OF THE

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.271
RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO MAKE SURE

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:28.673
THE LEGISLATURE PLAYS AN

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:29.740
IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:31.008
DEVELOPMENT AND GUIDANCE OF THE

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:33.544
SYSTEM OVERSIGHT OF THE SYSTEM.

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:35.680
WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:38.616
THE PROJECT HAS A MINIMAL RISK

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:39.183
OF FAILURE.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.485
AND WE WAN TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:43.721
THE THAT THE THAT THE PROJECT IN

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.222
THE APPROACH REALLY BUILDS ON

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:46.791
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:49.226
AND THE PAST EFFORTS -- THAT THE

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:50.895
STATE HAS ALREADY UNDERTAKEN.

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:52.396
SO SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMEND THE

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:54.265
LEGISLATURE ENACT LEGISLATION

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:57.635
CREATING A JPA ALONG THE LINES

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.770
OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY.

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.672
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WITH

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:03.140
SENATE BILL.

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:03.741
EIGHT EIGHT FIVE WE RECOMMEND

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.609
THE LEGISLATION SPECIFY THAT THE

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:08.345
GPAS TO INCLUDE THE SEGMENTS --

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:10.047
AS MEMBER AGENCIES SO THE ONES

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.749
CONTRIBUTED THE DATA AS WELL AS

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:13.884
NON SEGMENTAL REPRESENTATION

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:16.253
SEARCHES THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.589
BIPARTISAN REPRESENTATION FROM

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.191
THE LEGISLATURE.

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:21.859
AND THEN END THIS JPA

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:23.360
COMPOSITION IS CONSISTENT WITH

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:25.663
WHAT AN SP TWELVE NINETY EIGHT

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.831

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:28.199
ALREADY RECOMMENDED.

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:31.302
SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATION.

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:33.871
AND TELL THE JPA TO BUILD THE

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:35.406

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:44.648
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND WE

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:46.050
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATION

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:48.486
SPECIFY THE GPA IS TO DEVELOP A

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.354

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:04.335

DATA ACCESS AND HOW WE MANAGE --

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:13.917
THE PROPER USE AND DISCLOSURE OF

00:49:13.984 --> 00:49:14.985
DATA.

00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:16.320
AND THEN THE TREMENDOUS COSTS

00:49:16.386 --> 00:49:18.255
ASSOCIATED WITH BOB CONNECTING

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.023
DATED TODAY WE'VE HAD GOOD

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.591
SUCCESS IN NEGOTIATING CROSS

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:23.060
SEGMENT MENTAL AGREEMENTS

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.895
ANOTHER AMMO YEARS -- THE THESE

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:26.963
GENERALLY FOLLOW MONTHS OF LEGAL

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:29.933
NEGOTIATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.667
AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL WORK.

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.436
AND SO WHAT WE CAN DO THIS WORK

00:49:32.502 --> 00:49:34.271
TODAY I THINK THE BENEFITS OF A

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:36.039
NEW STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM --

00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:38.108
INCLUDE -- THE FACT THAT ACCESS

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:39.009
TO DATE IT WOULD NOT BE

00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:40.243
DEPENDENT ON THE PRIORITIES OF

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.079
THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS OUR

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:44.247
ABILITY TO SHARE DATA --

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:46.350
GENERALLY FOLLOWS A PROCESS BY

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:47.818
WHICH WE PRIORITIZE REQUESTS

00:49:47.884 --> 00:49:49.519
BASED ON OUR GOALS WHICH MAY BE

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:50.821
DIFFERENT FROM THE GOALS THAT

00:49:50.887 --> 00:49:52.089
OTHERS HAVE.

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:53.824
I ASSUME OTHER ENTITIES ARE A

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:54.991
VALUE ADDING OUR REQUEST FOR

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.993
DATA BASED ON THEIR OWN

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.128
PRIORITIES.

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:00.697
WE THINK FEWER TRANSACTIONS OF

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:02.733
STUDENT LEVEL DATA -- WOULD EASE

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:04.267
CONCERNS ABOUT DATA SECURITY

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:06.670
RIGHT NOW EACH TIME PEOPLE AND

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:07.804
TURNED IT NMO YOU THEIR MATCHING

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.339
INDIVIDUAL STIRRED LEVEL DATA

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:10.941
USING STUDENT IDENTIFIERS WHICH

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:11.708
MAKES IT.

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:14.077
WHITE CLEAR THAT -- THERE COULD

00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:15.312
BE SECURITY CONCERNS.

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:17.047
ABOUT OBVIOUSLY THE EFFICIENCIES

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:20.016
OF HAVING A CENTRAL -- PROCESSOR

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.518

OF THE PRESIDENT.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:53.490
THE UNIVERSITY IS VERY

00:54:53.556 --> 00:54:55.225
SUPPORTIVE OF A STATE WIDE

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:56.593
LONGITUDINAL DATABASE WE

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.128
UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF

00:54:58.194 --> 00:55:00.397
HAVING THIS KIND OF INFORMATION.

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:02.132
ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT TO CONSIDER

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:05.035
IS HOW TO ENSURE STUDENT PRIVACY.

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:06.603
THIS APPLIES TO BOTH THE DATA

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:08.905
SYSTEM ITSELF ALONG WITH HOW THE

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:11.274
INFORMATION IS SHARED.

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:12.942
PULLING FROM FOR A WE PROPOSED

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:14.477
LANGUAGE FOR THE BUDGET TRAILER

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:16.212
BILL THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:17.313
TO CONSIDER ON HOW TO MAKE

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.882
STUDENT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:21.384
MARKS WITH THE WE ALSO THINK

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:22.485
THAT IF THE STATEWIDE

00:55:22.552 --> 00:55:24.721
LONGITUDINAL DATA PROJECT WILL

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:26.356
BE SHARED WITH RESEARCHERS.

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:27.991
A GOOD METHOD IS TO CREATE A

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:30.026
PUBLIC USE VERSION OF DE

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:32.495
IDENTIFIED RESEARCH DATA WITH

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:33.797
OPEN ACCESS.

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:35.932
WE CAN TALK ABOUT MORE THAT IF

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.567
YOU'RE IF INTERESTED.

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:38.635
BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WE HAVE

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:40.336
A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:42.238
THE HELPED US SUCCEED.

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:43.773
FIRST OF THE KNOW THE PRIMARY

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.042
QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ANSWER.

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:47.911
THEN START WITH A SMALLER

00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:49.245
SMALLER PROJECT.

00:55:49.312 --> 00:55:51.548
A PILOT SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:32.989
COLLECTIVELY.

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:33.957
ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL HAS

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:35.625
SOME QUESTIONS THANK YOU I JUST

00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:37.227
WANT TO COMMENT -- I THINK IT'S

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:39.129
MISTER SULLIVAN -- I THINK YOU

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:41.364
GAVE THE MOST HONEST ASSESSMENT

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:42.265
OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:43.166
RIGHT NOW THIS IS A BIG

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.400
CHALLENGE IS IN THE VERY

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:45.401
EXPENSIVE.

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:47.237
IT'S VERY COMPLEX AND SITTING

00:56:47.303 --> 00:56:49.372
HERE I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED WHY

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.875
WE NEED TO DO THIS -- I HOPE

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:53.676
WERE COLLECTING EXISTING DATA

00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:57.580
NOT CREATING NEW DATA OR THAT

00:56:57.647 --> 00:56:58.681
AGAIN YOU TALK ABOUT.

00:56:58.748 --> 00:56:59.449
YOU'RE VERY STE PLATFORMS AND

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:00.483
HOW WE ACCESS THAT THAT I DON'T

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:01.351
KNOW.

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:03.153
HOW THAT WOULD BE DONE BUT I'M

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.721
SURE IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME?

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:06.222
AND I'M SURE IT WOULD TAKE A LOT

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:07.824
OF MONEY AND I REALLY.

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.092
WONDER WHY WE'RE DOING THIS I'M

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:10.994
NOT CONVINCED WHERE I SIT.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.096
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO INFORM?

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:13.997
HEY.

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:16.065
I'M JUST NOT AT THIS POINT --

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:18.134
AND I LOOK AT OTHER DATA SYSTEMS

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:19.903
WE'VE COLLECTED TAKE THE ASPECT

00:57:19.969 --> 00:57:21.171
HAS RIGHT VERY.

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:22.605
IN OUR NEVER MATURED TO THE

00:57:22.672 --> 00:57:26.442
PRODUCT THAT WE WE CONTEMPLATED --

00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:27.844
AS LAID OUT IN THE ORIGINAL CODE

00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:30.013
SECTION IT'S TODAY IT'S A TEST

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:31.247
NOT AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM WAS

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:32.482
SUPPOSED TO BE AN ASSESSMENT

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:33.817
SYSTEM IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:35.018
LEGISLATURE GAVE SOME MONEY.

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:37.320
THEY CREATED SOMETHING CREATED

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:37.787
CONSORTIUM [inaudible]

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:41.691
AND IT NOW IS IS IS SUB PAR

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:42.959
QUITE FRANKLY IT'S NOT TEACHER

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:44.160
FRIENDLY RIGHT IT'S NOT THUS

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:45.662
IT'S NOT STUDENT FAMILY.

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:46.596
IT DOESN'T INFORMACIóN NOT

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:48.064
BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S IT'S IT'S A

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.833
TESTING SYSTEM NOT IN THE SYSTEM

00:57:49.899 --> 00:57:52.535
SO I USE AN EXAMPLE AND NOW

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:53.136
WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:53.536
ARE.

00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:54.871
WE HAD BUILT IN RESISTANCE TO

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:56.172
CHANGING ANYTHING FROM THE

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:57.841
CONSORTIUM THE ASPECT AND

00:57:57.907 --> 00:57:59.542
SOURCING EVEN IN THE DEPARTMENT.

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:01.544
OF EDUCATION WELL THIS IS MY YOU

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:02.312
KNOW MY BABY AND I DON'T WANT

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:03.246
ANYONE.

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:04.848
CHANGING AND I JUST WORRY THAT

00:58:04.914 --> 00:58:06.549
YOU KNOW WE BACK UP WE'RE FOR

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:07.617
CREATING ANOTHER.

00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:09.385
SUCH ANIMAL WITH THIS DATA

00:58:09.452 --> 00:58:10.553
SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE A

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.621
VARIETY OF PARTNERS AND ARE THEY

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:13.289
GOING TO AGREE.

00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:14.190
ON HOW WE MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE

00:58:14.257 --> 00:58:15.491
IT.

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:17.493
YOU KNOW DOWN THE TIME MINOR HOW.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.795
HOW DATA SHOULD BE SPELLED OUT

00:58:18.862 --> 00:58:20.196
AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE I'M SURE

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:20.730
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:22.565
TOGETHER ONCE IS STARTED WE

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:23.900
CREATE AND HAVE TO MEET?

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.802
EVEN AFTER THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:26.369
MAKE CERTAIN CHANGES BECAUSE

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:28.471
YOUR YOUR ORGANIZATIONS ARE

00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:31.307
GOING TO HAVE TO TO COMMUNICATE --

00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:32.375
SO I'M JUST SKEPTICAL BECAUSE

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:33.576
MORE THAT WERE GONNA DUMP A LOT

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:35.078
OF MONEY INTO SOMETHING THAT'S

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:36.312
VERY COMPLEX.

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:37.647
SO I APPRECIATE ACTUALLY THE

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:39.716
BOTH THE HIGHER EDUCATION --

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:40.416
BOTH YOU GENERAL FOR HIGHER

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:42.085
EDUCATION YOU YOU DIDN'T REALLY

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:43.253
SAID WHICH IS CERTAINLY HEADED

00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:45.488
AT THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ANIMAL.

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:48.224
AND PEOPLE IN SACRAMENTO LOVE TO

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.092
CREATE THINGS.

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:49.726
AND YOU KNOW THROUGH A LOT OF

00:58:49.792 --> 00:58:51.494
MONEY MAYBE SOMEONE TIME MONEY

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:52.495
AT SOMETHING LIKE THE S. BACK

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:53.329
RIGHT.

00:58:53.396 --> 00:58:54.964
AND THEN LATER ON WELL HEY THERE

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:56.266
IT IS IN A RESERVE SYSTEMS THERE

00:58:56.332 --> 00:58:57.767
IS BUT IT NEVER MATURE TO THE

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:58.434
PRODUCT THAT WE'RE EVEN TALKING

00:58:58.501 --> 00:58:59.369
ABOUT TODAY.

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:01.337
SO THAT'S MY FEAR THAT THIS IS

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:02.639
JUST TEN MILLION MAYBE ONCE BUT

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:04.207
A LOT OF MONEY AND A LOT OF

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:06.809
YEARS. TO CREATE SUCH A SYSTEM

00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:08.611
WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR.

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:12.382
THANK YOU SOMEONE MERA MEDINA.

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:14.918
OF I ALSO SHARE A MY COLLEAGUES

00:59:14.984 --> 00:59:17.553
SKEPTICISM AN INTERESTING ENOUGH

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:18.988
WE'RE BOTH TEACHERS YOU KNOW

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:19.889
WE'RE BOTH.

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:22.859
TEACHERS WHO HAVE -- NO SPENT

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:24.360
PRETTY MUCH ARE HOLD WORKING

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:27.764
LIVES -- IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:31.634
AND I AM VERY ALSO KINDA CONFUSE

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:31.935
[inaudible]

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:34.037
ABOUT.

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:36.673
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- YOU

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:37.607
KNOW HOW.

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:39.509
WHAT INFORMATION WE ARE ACTUALLY

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:41.744
TRYING TO GET IN AND CHAIRED THE

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:43.746
THE SKEPTICISM -- MISTER

00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:47.183
O'DONNELL ON THE VALUE OF IT --

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:50.320
AND ALSO SHARE HIS SKEPTICISM ON

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:52.889
THE TRACK RECORD OF CALIFORNIA

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:56.225
IN AS SOME OF YOU ALLUDED -- TO

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:58.294
IN THE AREA OF IT AND I WOULD GO

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:00.797
BACK TO OUR LAST HEARING.

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:03.366
A LAST WEEK WHEN WE LOOKED AT ON

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.233
OUR AGENDA.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.869
YOU SEE.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.838
TAKING THE ENTERPRISE WHICH WAS

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:11.607
A BIG ENTERPRISE OF OF OF

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:13.676
CONSOLIDATING PAY AND I KNOW

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.378
THESE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS AND

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:19.248
BUT THAT WAS IN I WILL REMIND

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:20.450
THIS GROUP IS I DID.

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:23.286
LAST WEEK THAT THAT WAS SEEN AS

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:24.887
A COST SAVING.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.990
AND THE COST.

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:29.959
MR DONALD THE COST OF THAT WHICH

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.694
WAS PRESENTED TO US A FEW YEARS

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:32.695
BACK.

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.631
AS A COST SAVING YOU KNOW IS.

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:38.634
TREMENDOUSLY OVER BUDGET.

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.737
NOT SAVING ANY MONEY SO I I

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.939
AGREE THAT OUR TRACK RECORD ON

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:45.241
BIG PROJECTS HASN'T BEEN TOO

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:46.009
GOOD.

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.810
MAYBE THOUGH I COULD GET A

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:48.945
LITTLE BIT BETTER UNDERSTANDING

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:50.680
FROM EVERYONE HERE.

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.648
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND OF DATA

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.183
IS IT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.418
YOU KNOW I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:59.088
TO OF PUTTING A NUMBER ON ON A

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:00.490
CHILD [inaudible]

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:04.060
AT AT EIGHT ZERO TO THREE AND

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.195
FOLLOWING THEM ALONG.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.363
ALL THE WAY TO COLLEGE THAT'S

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.898
JUST ME.

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.833
YOU KNOW AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.936
SEE THE VALUE OF DOING THAT --

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.505
AS SOMEONE EXPERIENCE AND IN

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.373
EDUCATION SO I I WOULD NEED A

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.142
LOT OF CLARIFICATION I HOPE THAT

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:21.244
I COULD GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.846
THIS MORNING.

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.548
THEN MAYBE I CAN START.

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.617
SO SO PERHAPS AS AS AS AN

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:28.818
APPROACH HERE AND IT'S SORT OF

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:33.623
SORT OF HELLO I THINK A AFTER OF

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:36.526
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:39.062
INTERSECTION OF GROUPS.

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:40.129
I MAYBE OF LANDED IN A PLACE.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.564
WHERE THERE'S REALLY TWO

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:43.299
DIFFERENT WAYS TO THINK ABOUT

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:45.034
THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SAID?

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.736
THERE'S AN OPERATIONAL PIECE.

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.438
WHICH IS TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:50.006
OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:52.308
YOU CAN THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.509
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE NEEDING

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:55.144
DATA FOR PLACEMENT THAT HAS TO

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:58.147
COME UP OUT OF THE CD RECORDS.

01:01:58.214 --> 01:01:59.282
THAT THERE'S MAYBE A BETTER WAY

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:01.717
TO FACILITATE ADMISSIONS TO BOTH

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.019
UNIVERSITIES.

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.387
OR ALL -- THREE THE COMMUNITY

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:06.055
COLLEGE AS WELL FOR STUDENTS

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:07.490
THAT ARE LOOKING TO GO ON TO

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:08.291
COLLEGE.

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:10.493
SO THERE'S AN OPERATIONAL PIECE

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.629
AND I THINK THAT PEACE IS EASIER

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:15.765
TO TO MAKE A CASE.

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.100
FOR I THINK THE RESEARCH AND

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.868
POLICY PIECES OF FAR MORE

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:22.138
COMPLEX PIECE AS AS A SERVICE.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:23.606
BUT MY COLLEAGUE FROM YOU SEE

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:24.807
AND AND OTHERS.

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:27.276
IN TERMS OF OF WHAT IT TAKES TO

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:30.213
GET FOR WHAT PURPOSE.

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.715
AND THAT I THINK STILL REMAINS A

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:34.684
LITTLE MORE OPEN ENDED IN TERMS

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:38.187
OF WEAR MAKE UP.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.755
AND I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF OF

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:42.625
K. TWELVE AND ESPECIALLY AT WE

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:43.826
WE KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.394
GRADUATE FROM WHICH CLASSES WE

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.530
KNOW THE DEMOGRAPHIC -- MAKE UP

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:48.598
THE PROGRAMS THEY'RE INVOLVED

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.399
WITH WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:51.667
TO THEM AFTER WE LEAVE.

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.436
AFTER THEY LEAVE OUR SCHOOLS AND

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:54.470
IF WE WERE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:55.605
MORE ABOUT THE STUDENTS AFTER

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:56.772
THE OF OUR SCHOOLS WHETHER OR

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:58.708
NOT THEY ENROLLED IN A COMMUNITY

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.243
COLLEGE AND THEY PERSISTED.

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:01.477
AND THEY GRADUATED OR IF THEY

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:03.012
DIDN'T IF THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.614
PAST THAT FIRST SEMESTER WE

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.882
WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:08.217
PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.385
OR THAT ARE BEING -- SPOT --

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.187
LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS FIVE AND A

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.622
MILLION DOLLARS TO A PARTICULAR

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:14.891
PROGRAM BUT NOT AS EFFECTIVE IN

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.726
LIEU OF COLLECTING THAT DATA --

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:18.461
EXCHANGING THAT DATA WITH ARE MY

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:20.296
COLLEAGUES AT THE TABLE THERE'S

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:22.365
A VOID OUT THERE.

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:23.799
AND IT MOST EVERY OTHER STATE.

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:25.434
NO THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:27.603
HAVE EXISTING SYSTEMS IN WHICH

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.071
THEY'RE CONNECTED ON A ON A TWO

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.040
WEEK CONNECTIONS.

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.609
PIECE RIGHT NOW WITH -- WITH

01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:34.477
THEIR INSTITUTES OF HIGHER

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.279
EDUCATION BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:39.348
BLACK THAT -- WE HAVE WE WE ARE

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:40.716
NOT ABLE TO TALK ABOUT COLLEGE

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.018
GOING RATES WITH ANY.

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:44.187
YOU KNOW ANY CERTAINTY -- WE

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.622
HAVE WE HAVE A ROBUST DATA

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:51.561
SYSTEM FOR K..

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:52.128
TWELVE CALLED CAL PATS AND

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:52.762
THAT'S BEEN A TEN YEAR

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:53.596
INVESTMENT ARE LONGER NOW BY BY

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.933
THIS BY THIS BODY -- THAT HAS --

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.501
ALLOWED US TO COME UP WITH

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:00.036
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:01.437
STUDENTS ARE SUSPENDED AND THIS

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.672
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ABLE TO

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:04.440
TELL US MAYBE SINCE SUSPEND

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:05.841
STUDENTS FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:08.277
CYST OF OF DISCIPLINARY POLICY.

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.579
SO THERE'S BEEN A YOU KNOW A

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:11.013
RICHNESS THAT HAS COME OUT OF

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.782
THE INCREASE QUALITY OF THE DATA

01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:14.417
COLLECTION YOU SEE AND AND AND

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.118
USING THE SUSPENSION ANALOGY WE

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:17.253
SEE WE'VE SEEN A DECREASE OVER

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.388
THE LAST -- SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:21.224
WITH COLLECTED THAT DATA SO AS

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:23.960
THESE SYSTEMS HAVE BECOME MORE --

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.695
MORE MORE STAB WISHED ME NO MORE

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:27.597
HOW TO TO SHOULD HAVE BETTER

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:28.998
DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS WE ARE

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.633
MEETING ON A MONTHLY BASIS WITH

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.801
AGAIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:33.302
AND I THINK THAT WE ARE.

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:34.971
YOU KNOW ON TRACK TO TO MEET --

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.505
THE DEADLINES THAT ARE HERE THAT

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:37.673
ARE LAID OUT -- IN THIS --

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.709
PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR TO

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.177
HAVE SOMETHING ESTABLISHED BY BY

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:43.045
DECEMBER -- I'M I'M CONFIDENT MY

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:47.083
TO BETTER POSITION WE HAVE BEEN --

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:49.719
OVER THE LAST DECADE.

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:51.287
IF I COULD ASK A QUESTION.

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:53.723
AND I AM A PRETTY CONFUSED.

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:54.824
I I I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:58.427
DISCIPLINE -- AND NOT HAVING

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.296
DISCIPLINE SHARED SO HOW

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.098
SPECIFIC YOU KNOW DO WE REALLY

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:04.700
NEED SPECIFIC INFORMATION.

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:07.837
RIGHT WITH THE DATA REALLY GO.

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:09.905
SPECIFICALLY TO A STUDENT.

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:12.074
THAT'S A QUESTION.

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:15.211
YES I WOULD GO SPECIFICALLY TO

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.112
STUDENT BUT IN MY REMARKS TODAY.

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:17.913
SURE THERE DISCIPLINE RECORD

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.481
MIGHT BE.

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.483
ON NOW THERE WOULD BE A RECORD

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.518
NO I I WAS I WAS USING THE

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.786
ANALOGY FOR THE DISCIPLINE

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.154
RECORDS TO US TO SHOW YOU HOW

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:26.722
THE DATA QUALITY HAS --

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:29.292
INCREASED OVER TIME AND YOU

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:32.728
TALKED ABOUT THE THE CONFIDENCE

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:33.396
IN DATA SYSTEMS RIGHT SO I WOULD

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:33.963
SAY THE CONFIDENCE AND DATA

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.464
SYSTEMS HAS INCREASED OVER TIME

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.300
AT LEAST AT THE K. TWELVE LEVEL.

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:38.034
BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.101
APPROPRIATE TO SHARE WITH HIGHER

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:40.436
EDUCATION DISCIPLINES AN EXAMPLE

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:42.405
OF WHAT I USED AS WHAT NOT TO

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:42.938
SHARE I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:43.873
APPROPRIATE THAT.

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:45.341
THE STUDENT WAS SUSPENDED IN

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.742
FIRST GRADE AT THAT.

01:05:46.809 --> 01:05:48.611
THAT KEEPS FOLLOWING THEM

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:49.945
THROUGHOUT THEIR THEIR THEIR

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:52.848
THEIR VARIOUS YEARS FIVE BUT

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.383
THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I HAVE.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.485
WOOD IS STUDENTS.

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:58.754
WITH WITH THIS DATA HAVE THAT

01:05:58.821 --> 01:05:59.989
NOW.

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.590
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT.

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:02.591
HAS A VALUE IN THAT AT ALL I

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:04.894
MEAN YOU KNOW THAT'S INFORMATION

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.128
THAT'S GOOD FOR SCHOOL.

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:08.197
BUT I DON'T THINK THE STATE

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:10.199
NEEDS THAT INFORMATION.

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:11.133
THE DISCIPLINE INFORMATION RIGHT

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.902
OKAY.

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:14.937
BUT BUT YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:16.839
AND WE WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:18.240
THAT FOR THE LAST. EIGHT YEARS

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:19.642
OUT.

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.510
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE STUDENT

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:22.611
IS WHAT I'M ASKING CORRECT AND

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:24.213
BY THAT INFORMATION ALSO ABLE TO

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.481
TALK ABOUT TRENDS AT THE STATE

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.016
LEVEL HOW MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:27.950
MALES.

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:29.852
WHO ARE ALSO IN THE SPECIAL ED

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.187
PROGRAM BE SUSPENDED AT A HIGHER

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:34.323
RATE THAN THEIR PEERS SO THAT IS

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.559
INFORMATION THAT WE'RE ABLE --

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:37.727
TO TO LEVERAGE IN THE SYSTEM AS

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.295
A RESULT OF THAT THAT STUDENT

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:40.596
LEVEL DATA COLLECTION ABSENT

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:41.464
THAT SOON DOUBLE DATA COLLECTION

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.966
I COULD NOT GIVE YOU THOSE KINDS

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:47.636
OF STATISTICS.

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:49.338
OKAY DID YOU WANNA RESPOND TO

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:52.141
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE ON

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:52.441
HERE YEAH.

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:53.275
AT THE END.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:53.843
JUST TO GIVE YOU A CONCRETE

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:55.311
EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE PASSED

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:58.080
LEGISLATION NUMBER YEARS AGO.

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.548
TO REFORM THE STREAMLINED

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:01.250
TRANSFER PATHWAYS FROM COMMUNITY

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:04.620
COLLEGE TO CAL STATE UNIVERSITY

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:05.888
SO SHE TO REFER TRANSFER.

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.256
SO AFTER AND THAT THE PURPOSE

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:09.325
WAS TO WAS TO GET IT SO THAT

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:10.593
STUDENTS GOING FOR MAKE ME

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.762
COLLEGE TO CSU TO GET A

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:14.130
BACHELOR'S DEGREE ARE TAKING.

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:15.965
SIEU UNITS AS POSSIBLE TO GET

01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:16.732
THAT DEGREE THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.467
TAKING ACCESS UNITS WHICH OFTEN

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.736
HAPPENS WHEN THEY TRANSFERRED TO

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:21.871
CSU.

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:23.639
COURSES THEY TOOK A COMMUNITY

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:24.473
COLLEGES DON'T.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.175
TRANSFER OVER TO ARTICULATE AND

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:27.276
IT AND IT CAN BE REALLY

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:29.345
DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS.

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:31.046
SO THE LEGISLATURE HAD THIS

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:34.250
LEGISLATION OVERHAULED TO CREATE

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:35.951
REALLY REFORM THE SYSTEM.

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:38.354
BUT TO THIS DAY.

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:39.588
YOU DON'T KNOW THE LEGISLATURE

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:41.424
DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY STE TOTAL

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.325
UNITS STUDENTS ARE TAKING GOING

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.760
FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CL

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:46.195
STATE UNIVERSITY.

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:47.163
WOULD ASK.

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:48.764
CAL STATE UNIVERSITY YOU'RE AT

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:50.499
T. STUDENTS YOUR SURGERY FOR

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:52.134
TRANSFER STUDENTS VERSUS YOUR

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.502
REGULAR TRANSFER STUDENTS HOW

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:54.737
MANY TOTAL UNITS OF THE

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:55.938
ACCUMULATED COMMITTEE COLLEGE

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.006
AND CSU.

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.507
THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WITHOUT

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:00.476
DOING SOME SPECIAL DAIS SHARING

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:01.844
AGREEMENT WHICH IS QUITE

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.412
CUMBERSOME AND THEY CAN'T TELL

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:04.713
YOU BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.282
DATA SYSTEM AND IT'S DIFFERENT

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:07.550
SILOS.

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:08.417
FROM THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE DATA

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:11.153
SYSTEM SO JUST ONE EXAMPLE IF WE

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:11.954
WERE TO IT IF THE LEGISLATURE

01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:14.123
WHERE TO INTEGRATE DATA SYSTEMS

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:15.191
YOU'D BE ABLE TO GET A LOT

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:16.592
BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT.

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:18.961
PATHWAYS FROM STUDENTS FROM ONE

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.329
SEGMENT TO ANOTHER.

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:21.497
CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:22.965
PATHWAYS FROM HIGH SCHOOL SICK

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.633
MANY COLLEGES WHICH YOU'VE SPENT

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.235
A LOT OF MONEY ON WHAT'S THE

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:27.803
IMPACT OF THAT THAT COULD BE

FIRST A SPECIAL EDUCATION TO PAY

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:12.360
COULD BETTER PREPARE NEW

ALTHOUGH THE EXISTING RESEARCH

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:29.711
IS LIMITED IF WE FOUND THREE

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:32.514
STUDIES GENERALLY SUPPORTING

GROWING IN RECENT YEARS AND IS

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.336
LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE

MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:35.410
WE DISCUSSED TO POTENTIAL

RATHER TIME INTENSIVE.

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:46.321
THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

TO HOW HELPFUL THEY CAN BE FOUND

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:54.462
THE PREPARATION TOOL.

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:55.363
ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:02.804
LASTLY WE ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.205
THE IMPACT EIGHT SPECIAL

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:06.541

TEACHER SUPPLY.

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:09.677
AS YOU WELL NOW THE STATE HAS

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.379
FACED CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF

ALL CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS.

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:25.026
A NEW T. P. REQUIREMENT WOULD AT

WORK AND COST TO THE PROCESS OF

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.363
BECOMING A SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.633
ALTHOUGH THE ADDITION OF THE T.

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:32.867
P. A. MIGHT SEEM MODEST IN THE

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:36.938
TEACHERS.

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.072
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MIGHT

01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:39.707
ALSO AFFECT THE NUMBER OF

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:41.509
PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS INTERESTED

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:45.547

CREDENTIAL.

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:49.184
MOVING ON TO OUR LAST PAGE.

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:50.552
WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:52.353
ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.988

THE EIGHT OFFICE BUT ON BALANCE

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:02.964
WE THINK THE PROPOSAL COULD HELP

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.432
IMPROVE TEACHER PREPARATION.

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:05.767

EDUCATION.

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:11.406
HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THE

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:13.741
LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CTC TO

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:15.410
ASSESS HOW THE SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:25:15.477 --> 01:25:17.245

BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:21.483
WHICH IS WHEN THAT REQUIREMENT

01:25:21.549 --> 01:25:22.584
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:23.985
CDC COULD COLLECT INFORMATION

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:25.220
DURING THE PILOT PHASES OF

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.989
IMPLEMENTATION REGARDING.

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:28.957
ONE HOW THE T. P. IS AFFECTING

HOW HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES TO

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:36.564
COMPLETE THE DPA AND HOW THIS

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:37.999
AFFECTS OVERALL WORKLOAD.

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.601
AND THREE WHAT PERSPECTIVE

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:40.902
TEACHERS CONSIDERED THE ADDED

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:44.105
VALUE OF THE T. PAY AND BETTER

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.607
PREPARING THEM FOR THE CLASSROOM.

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:46.741
THE LEGISLATURE COULD THEN USE

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.409
THIS INFORMATION TO EVALUATE

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:50.278
WHETHER THE SPECIAL EDUCATION T.

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:55.436
IF THEIR CREDENTIAL IN ANOTHER

01:27:55.503 --> 01:27:56.838
STATE.

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:58.806
SECOND QUESTION -- THE STATE

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:00.608
SUPERINTENDENT VERY RECENTLY PUT

01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:02.377
OUT -- I THINK A PRIORITY FOR

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:02.577
HIM.

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:07.649
WHERE HE SAID THAT -- 6% OF

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:09.317
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE AFRICAN

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:11.653
AMERICAN BUT ONLY 1% OF THE

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:15.390
TEACHERS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN.

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:16.157
HE ALSO SAID THAT WE'RE I

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:18.960
BELIEVE 45% OF THE STUDENTS IN

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:22.263
CALIFORNIA ARE LATINO ONLY 5% OF

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:26.634
THE TEACHERS.

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:26.934
ARE LATINO.

01:28:27.001 --> 01:28:28.436
SO.

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.004
SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:30.571
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:32.707
TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMMISSION

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:34.876
DOING TO HELP.

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:36.310
CHANGE THAT TWO QUESTIONS.

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:36.878
SO WITH RESPECT YOUR FIRST

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.079
QUESTION SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:38.613
TEACHERS PREPARED IN OTHER

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.014
STATES WE HAVE OF THE

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:40.815
LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN ACTION IN

01:28:40.882 --> 01:28:41.282
THE PAST TO BRING SOME

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:43.317
NORMALIZATION TO HOW WE LOOK AT

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:43.951
OUT OF STATE PREPARE TEACHERS.

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:45.086
BASED ON HOW MANY YEARS OF

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.220
EXPERIENCE THAT TEACHER HAS

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:47.955
SERVING IN ANOTHER STATE.

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:49.424
SO I BELIEVE IN SPECIAL

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:50.858
EDUCATION YOU CORRECT ME IF I'M

01:28:50.925 --> 01:28:52.994
WRONG JOSH SPEAKS IS -- ARE

01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:54.762
LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AND MAY

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:55.596
HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:57.265
THIS -- ANY TEACHER COMES TO

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:58.733
CALIFORNIA WITH TWO OR MORE

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.168
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.

01:29:00.234 --> 01:29:01.269
IS GRANTED A PRELIMINARY

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:01.769
CREDENTIALING GIVEN AN

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:03.905
OPPORTUNITY -- TO GO THROUGH

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:05.039
INDUCTION AND CLEAR THAT

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:07.341
CREDENTIAL IF THEY NEED -- TO

01:29:07.408 --> 01:29:08.810
ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THE

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:12.013
REQUIRED FOR INDUCTION -- THEY

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.515
ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ACCIDENTAL

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:16.317
OUT OF STATE.

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:16.984
IF YOUR CREDENTIALS OUT OF STATE

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:18.086
YOU CAN COME TO CALIFORNIA

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:19.120
PRESENT YOUR CREDENTIAL AND

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:20.088
RECEIVE A CREDENTIAL IN

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:21.689
CALIFORNIA TO BEGIN SERVICE IF

01:29:21.756 --> 01:29:22.657
THERE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT YOU

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:23.224
MAY BE MISSING FOR INSTANCE

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:25.526
CALIFORNIA REQUIRES ALL TEACHERS

01:29:25.593 --> 01:29:26.160
TO BE PREPARED TO TEACH ENGLISH

01:29:26.227 --> 01:29:27.228
LEARNERS.

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:28.996
IN OTHER STATES THAT'S AN ADDED

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:30.398
CERTIFICATION.

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:31.699
IN SOME CASES A NOT AT ALL SO WE

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:34.435
PROVIDE TIME FOR TEACHERS WHILE

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:35.970
TEACHING TO MEET THAT

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.071
REQUIREMENT SO THEY'RE

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:39.674
CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA MAY

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:40.975
BE ADDITIONAL.

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:41.642
WORK NEAR MAYBE THERE MAY BE BUT

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:42.844
IT'S BEEN FAIRLY LIMITED BY THE

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:43.845
LEGISLATURE IN PRIOR.

01:29:43.911 --> 01:29:44.679
A LEGISLATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:47.415
ACTED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:48.916
YEARS SO -- WE WE WELCOME

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:49.984
TEACHERS FROM OTHER STATES

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:52.487
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND 25%

01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:53.821
OF THE TEACHERS WE CREDENTIAL

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.456
EVERY YEAR ARE PREPARED IN OTHER

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:56.791
STATES SO THAT'S NOT AN

01:29:56.858 --> 01:30:00.027
INSIGNIFICANT -- POPULATION

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:07.268
COMING INTO CALIFORNIA SO.

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:10.505
SO AND JOSH SPEAKS FOR MICE.

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:12.507
I JUST WANTED -- TO NOTE THAT --

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:13.107
WE ARE.

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:14.609
CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO

01:30:14.675 --> 01:30:16.110
MAKE THAT PROCESS YOU KNOW AS

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:17.612
EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE.

01:30:17.678 --> 01:30:18.746
SEE IF THERE ARE UNNECESSARY

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:19.781
OBSTACLES WE CAN REMOVE -- AND

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:21.149
BASED ON SOME DISCUSSIONS THAT

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:22.450
WE HAD WITH ASSEMBLY AT

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:24.485
COMMITTEE STAFF -- IN THE

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:25.887
INTERIM -- BEFORE THE SESSION

01:30:25.953 --> 01:30:27.121
STARTED -- THERE IS ACTUALLY A

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:29.290
BILL AB -- NINE EIGHT EIGHT THAT

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:32.560
IS -- CO SPONSORED BY -- CO

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:34.228
AUTHORED BY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:35.296
O'DONNELL.

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:37.665
THAT -- DOES ELIMINATES SORT OF

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:39.300
A AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER THAT WE

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:40.334
FOUND IT'S IT'S KIND OF

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:41.836
TECHNICAL BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.070
IT DOES IS.

01:30:43.137 --> 01:30:45.473
IF A PERSON COMES IN FROM OUT OF

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.407
STATE WITH THE GENERIC

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:47.842
SPECIALIST CREDENTIAL WHICH

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:49.544
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T ISSUE GENERIC

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:50.211
CREDENTIALS.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.580
WE ISSUE THEM IN SPECIALTY AREAS --

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:53.181
BUT OTHER STATES ISSUE GENERIC

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:56.317
CREDENTIALS -- THAT TEACHER GETS.

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:58.152
THE APPROPRIATE CALIFORNIA

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.887
CREDENTIAL THEY YOU KNOW THEY

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:00.822
TELL US WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:01.722
IN.

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.224
AND THEN WHILE THEY'RE TEACHING

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.959
ON THAT PRELIMINARY CALIFORNIA

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:07.595
CREDENTIAL THEY CAN USE --

01:31:07.662 --> 01:31:09.597
SERVICE AND CALIFORNIA CLASSROOM

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:12.266
UNDER THIS BILL -- TO MEET THE

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:14.635
THE SORT OF SPECIALIZATION

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:16.204
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY DIDN'T

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:20.374
TURN OUT OF STATE BECAUSE THEY

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:20.975
YOU KNOW WERE ISSUED A GENERIC

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:21.609
CREDENTIAL SO AGAIN THAT'S KIND

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:22.577
OF A TECHNICAL ISSUE BUT IT'S

01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:23.778
JUST -- SORT OF EMBLEMATIC OF

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:24.745
THE FACT THAT WE ARE.

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:27.415
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MAKE

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:31.619
THAT PROCESS.

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:35.356
AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE.

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:36.157
SO WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:38.125
QUESTION THAT YOU RAISED ABOUT

01:31:38.192 --> 01:31:38.726
THE DIVERSITY OF THE TEACHING

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.695
WORKFORCE -- WE HAVE SEEN OVER

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:41.696
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- AND

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:44.665
INCREASING NUMBER OF TEACHERS OF

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:46.200
COLOR AND ROLLED IN TEACHER

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:48.102
PREPARATION -- A PROSPECTIVE

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:49.303
TEACHERS OF COLOR LESS THAN 50%

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:50.872
OF THE TEACHERS AND ROLLED.

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:53.107
IN PREPARATION AND EARNING

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:54.609
CREDENTIALS -- SELF IDENTIFY AS

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:55.676
WHITE OR ANGLO BACKGROUND NOW I

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:58.579
THINK AROUND 30% AND I'LL GET

01:31:58.646 --> 01:32:00.014
YOU THE SPECIFIC DATA BUT IT'S

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:01.415
IT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER --

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:02.650
OF TEACHERS AND ROLLED IN

01:32:02.717 --> 01:32:05.086
SEEKING CREDENTIALS ARE OF

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:07.855
LATINO DESCENT AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:10.691
POPULATIONS CONTINUE TO BE OUT

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:12.860
WE NEED TO BEEF THAT UP AND AND

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:15.229
DO MORE RECRUITMENT AN OUT REACH.

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:16.464
TO CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY OUR THE

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:17.098
TEACHING WORKFORCE BUT IT'S AN

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:18.266
ONGOING COMMITMENT NOT JUST OF

01:32:18.332 --> 01:32:19.500
THE COMMISSION'S BUT ALSO OF

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:20.835
EVERY TEACHER PREPARATION

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:22.270
PROGRAM IN THE STATE.

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:23.871
THEY ARE SEEKING ACTIVELY TO

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:25.306
RECRUIT A MORE DIVERSE TEACHING

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:27.708
FORCE THE LEGISLATURE ALSO HAS

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:29.010
ENACTED AS SOME OF THE GRANT

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:31.045
PROGRAMS THE CLASSIFIED GRANT

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:32.013
PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE IS GOT A

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:33.514
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIVERSE

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:35.283
POPULATION.

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:36.183
OF CANDIDATES MOVING INTO

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:37.752
TEACHING AS A RESULT OF THAT

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:39.954
INVESTMENT IN THEIR PREPARATION.

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:42.089
SO WHILE WE HAVEN'T YET ACHIEVED

01:32:42.156 --> 01:32:44.158
ANYTHING LIKE OUR REPRESENTATIVE

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:45.860
DIVERSITY IN THE TEACHING FORCE

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:47.728
THAT WOULD REFLECT THE DIVERSITY

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:50.231
OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION IT'S

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:51.866
TRENDING IN THAT DIRECTION.

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:54.502
AND AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:56.103
KNOW ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW -- I

01:32:56.170 --> 01:32:57.538
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT.

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:58.873
THIS STATE SUPERINTENDENT ALSO

01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:00.775
MENTION THE LACK OF OF MEN OF

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:01.809
COLOR.

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:04.111
IN THE IN THE CLASSROOM AND AND

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:05.446
AND I WONDER IF THERE MAY BE

01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:06.514
ALSO.

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:14.221
CONDITIONS IN THE SCHOOLS THAT.

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:15.756
EITHER INFLUENCE -- TEACHERS OF

01:33:15.823 --> 01:33:17.058
COLOR TO STAY IN THE PROFESSION --

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:18.259
AND TO DROP OUT AND I THINK THAT

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:19.260
MIGHT BE.

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:23.197
INTERESTING AND VALUABLE TO LOOK

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:23.397
INTO.

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:27.134
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:29.637
MR GALLAGHER.

SO -- NEAR THE YOU KNOW

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.207
OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT I THINK

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:34.375
THIS APPROACH IS A GOOD ONE TO

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:34.842
KIND.

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:36.277
RBC FIRST KIND OF COLLECT SOME

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:38.713
DATA SEE HOW THIS IS THIS IS

01:33:38.779 --> 01:33:41.349
WORKING -- AND AND CERTAINLY

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:41.983
WANT TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT WE

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:45.186
HAVE YOU KNOW -- BETTER PREPARED --

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:48.556
TEACHERS AND TRAIN TEACHERS --

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:50.891
THE THE CONCERN THAT I THAT I

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:51.459
MAY HAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW

01:33:51.525 --> 01:33:53.427
OBVIOUSLY WE WE NEED TO ENSURE

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:56.530
THAT WE HAVE -- SPECIAL

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:57.331
EDUCATION TEACHERS [inaudible]

01:33:57.398 --> 01:34:01.068
AND IT'S A IT'S A VITAL PART OF

01:34:01.135 --> 01:34:03.070
OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AN AD --

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:05.339
WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:07.842
IS IS MAYBE A BARRIER?

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:08.943
TO AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.177
MAYBE COLLECTING THIS DATA TO

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:13.447
FIND OUT HIS T. PAY REALLY.

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:14.982
IS THAT GOING TO REALLY HELP

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.617
THEM AS IS GOING TO KEEP OR IS

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:18.219
IT GONNA MAY BE A BARRIER TO

01:34:18.285 --> 01:34:21.589
PEOPLE -- CONTINUING IN THE IN

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:22.189
THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FIELD.

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:24.091
BECAUSE WE WE CAN AND DO YOU

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:25.926
HAVE SHORTAGES OF SPECIAL

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:31.232
EDUCATION TEACHERS -- AND AND SO

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:32.466
THAT'S ONE CONCERN THAT I HAVE

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:34.835
THE OTHER PART IS IS THE IS THE

01:34:34.902 --> 01:34:37.238
FEE LIKE I KNOW WE WE INCREASE

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:38.539
THE FEE.

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:41.142
IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE TEACHER

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:44.545
MISCONDUCT BACKLOG -- NOW THAT

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:46.147
WE'VE CLEARED THAT BACKLOG HAS

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:48.682
THERE BEEN ANY -- DISCUSSION

01:34:48.749 --> 01:34:51.986
ABOUT REDUCING THAT FEE.

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.587
BECAUSE HE OF FEES YOU KNOW THE

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:56.857
FEE STRUCTURE COULD ALSO

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:58.659
POTENTIALLY BE A BARRIER. TO

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:01.429
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:03.097
AND AGAIN I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:04.331
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS MAY IF YOU

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:04.965
COULD COMMENT ON BOTH OF THOSE

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:06.400
THINGS. TO BE HAPPY TO THANK YOU

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:07.968
SO WHERE WE FIND WITH TEACHING

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:09.003
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS WE'VE

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:13.407
BEEN WORKING ON THEM FOR FIFTEEN

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:13.941
YEARS PLUS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:16.677
IN TERMS OF WHAT CANDIDATES

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:17.912
EXPERIENCE.

01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:20.181
THE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT

01:35:20.247 --> 01:35:22.216
ORGANIZES THEIR STUDENT TEACHING.

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:23.250
THEY GIVE THEM SOME VERY

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:24.985
SPECIFIED TASKS THAT THEY NEED

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:25.619
TO COMPLETE WITHIN THEIR STUDENT

01:35:25.686 --> 01:35:28.155
TEACHING.

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:29.824
THAT BECOMES GIVE ME -- MISTER

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:31.725
DONALD.

01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:34.228
WE JUST TAKE A MOTION BUT ON

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:37.998
THIS RIVER.

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:39.100
YES WE WANT.

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:41.635
TO MOVE.

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:43.370
THIS - CTC BUDGET ITEM I DO

01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:45.639
HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS AFTER

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:47.541
WE VOTE TO APPROVE THE BUDGET

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:48.876
BUT ALWAYS HERE.

01:35:48.943 --> 01:35:51.011
THE MOST IN A SECOND -- PLEASE

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:53.314
CALL THE ROLL.

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:53.781
MCCARTY.

01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:53.948
HI.

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:56.317
GROW [inaudible]

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:58.619
GALLAGHER.

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:00.454
LIMON.

01:36:00.521 --> 01:36:10.397
MEDINA FOR SEARCHING FOR DONALD.

01:36:10.464 --> 01:36:12.466
SO I CONTINUE YES OKAY SO IT

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:13.634
ORGANIZES THEIR THEIR STUDENT

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.136
TEACHING SO TEACHERS GOING INTO

01:36:15.202 --> 01:36:15.769
A TEACHER PREPARATIONPROGRAM.

01:36:15.836 --> 01:36:17.338
IN GENERAL EXCEPT THE CONDITIONS

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:17.705
OF THE PROGRAM.

01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:19.006
THIS IS THIS HAS BECOME A

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:20.975
CONDITION OF THE PROGRAM THE

01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:21.842
TEACHERS -- THEY DON'T

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:23.110
NECESSARILY THINK ABOUT THIS AS

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:24.278
IT'S NOT LIKE THE BAR EXAM IT'S

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:24.912
NOT IT HASN'T BECOME THAT IT IS

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:25.479
A WAY OF ORGANIZING TEACHER

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:26.580
PREPARATION IT'S ONE OF THE

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:27.381
REQUIREMENTS THEY MUST MEET.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:28.015
IN ORDER TO EARN A CREDENTIAL.

01:36:28.082 --> 01:36:29.950
WE HAVE NOT FOUND THAT IT IS A

01:36:30.017 --> 01:36:30.818
BARRIER FOR TEACHERS IN THE

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:31.719
GENERAL EDUCATION POPULATION

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:33.487
WHAT WE FOUND INSTEAD IS THAT IT

01:36:33.554 --> 01:36:38.125
MOVES FROM THE ABSTRACT LEARNING

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:38.792
TO CONCRETE DOING IN THE

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:39.960
CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF THE NATURE

01:36:40.027 --> 01:36:40.594
OF THE TASKS WE GIVE THEM IT'S

01:36:40.661 --> 01:36:42.463
TIED TO VERY SPECIFIC PRIORITIES

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:44.298
THAT WE HAVE FOR TEACHING --

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:45.166
WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY

01:36:45.232 --> 01:36:47.168
INTERACT WITH LEARNERS SO FOR

01:36:47.234 --> 01:36:48.235
INSTANCE SOME OF THE CHANGES

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:49.470
WE'VE MADE IN OUR TEACHING

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:51.038
GENERALIZED TEACHING PERFORMANCE

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:51.605
ASSESSMENT.

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:54.108
HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM A KIND OF

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:57.344
OVERALL TEACH THE CONTENT. TWO

01:36:57.411 --> 01:36:57.878
YOU MUST TEACH CONTENT TO

01:36:57.945 --> 01:36:59.213
STUDENTS BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.314
ABOUT STUDENTS AND YOU HAVE TO

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:02.483
BE ABLE TO ADAPT WHAT YOU'RE

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:04.051
TEACHING TO THE NEEDS THEY BRING.

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:05.753
SO WE REQUIRE THEM IN A TEACHING

01:37:05.819 --> 01:37:07.621
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT TO ADAPT

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:09.123
THEIR LESSONS PUT TO ENGLISH

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:11.025
LEARNERS TO STUDENTS WHO MIGHT

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:12.526
BE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION TO

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:13.894
STUDENTS TO BRING ANY OTHER

01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:16.697
FRAGILE OR NEED OR OR ASSET TO

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:17.531
THE CLASSROOM.

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:18.966
SO MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:20.334
ABLE TO DO PLANNING THAT IT

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:22.303
TENDS TO BOTH CONTENT AND THE

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:23.837
STUDENTS THEIR TEACHING SO WHAT

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:25.039
THE T. P. A. DOES.

01:37:25.105 --> 01:37:26.307
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:29.076
ASSESS STUDENT LEARNING AND KNOW

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:31.011
WHEN THEIR INSTRUCTION.

01:37:31.078 --> 01:37:32.046
MET THE MARKING WHEN IT MISSED

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:33.447
THE MARK AND WHO WITNESSED THE

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:34.882
MARK FOR SO THAT THEY CAN BE

01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:36.083
TEACHING LEARNING IS IT IMPROVED

01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:38.118
AS A RESULT OF THAT.

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:39.220
SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT ELIO

01:37:39.286 --> 01:37:40.588
RAISED INDICATES THAT IT HAS

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:42.523
THAT IMPACT WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:45.492
KINDS OF LARGE SCALE STUDIES YET

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:46.660
THERE WOULD THAT WE WOULD ANSWER

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:48.295
THIS COMPLETELY AND CONCRETELY

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:49.163
AND FOREVER MORE.

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.131
BUT WE HAVE INDICATIONS THAT

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:52.600
THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:54.001
THE MOVEMENT FROM ABSTRACT

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:56.904
LEARNING ABOUT TO DOING IS THE

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.839
KEY THEORY OF ACTION HERE FOR

01:37:58.906 --> 01:37:59.106
TEACHERS.

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:00.407
SO MOVING THIS INTO SPECIAL

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:02.109
EDUCATION WILL ORGANIZE THEIR

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:03.244
CLINICAL PRACTICE AS WELL WE

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.212
NEED TO ADAPT IT TO THAT SPACE

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:06.380
THE LEARNERS IN SPECIAL

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:07.982
EDUCATION BRING A WHOLE

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:09.216
DIFFERENT KIND.

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:10.985
SET OF NEEDS -- AND ASSETS TO

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:12.820
THAT ENVIRONMENT ON SOCIAL

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:13.988
EMOTIONAL LEARNING NEEDS IN

01:38:14.054 --> 01:38:15.856
VARIOUS DIFFERENT SETTINGS IN

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:17.625
WHICH THEY ARE THEY'RE TAUGHT SO

01:38:17.691 --> 01:38:18.592
ADAPTING.

01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:20.060
THE FRAME OF A PERFORMANCE

01:38:20.127 --> 01:38:21.829
ASSESSMENT TO THE TYPES OF

01:38:21.895 --> 01:38:22.930
SETTINGS OF THE TYPES OF

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:24.865
STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE TEACHING

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:25.799
IS WHAT'S NECESSARY.

01:38:25.866 --> 01:38:29.036
I THINK THAT THE LARGER LIFT FOR

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:30.904
IMPLEMENTING THE TVA IS FOR

01:38:30.971 --> 01:38:31.839
PROGRAMS.

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:32.940
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T ALL

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:33.841
ORGANIZED THEIR PROGRAMS IN THIS

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:35.142
WAY SO MANY OF THE PREPARATION

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:36.777
PROGRAMS HAVE HAD TO RE DESIGN

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:37.978
SOME CURRICULUM.

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:39.046
REDESIGN HOW THEY SUPPORT

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:40.247
STUDENTS AND STUDENT TEACHING.

01:38:40.314 --> 01:38:41.782
BUT WE IT DOESN'T INCREASE THE

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:43.317
NUMBER OF HOURS OF SPUR OF

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:44.618
STUDENT TEACHING.

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:46.086
IT'S SIMPLY PUTS IN PLACE AND

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:46.587
THINGS THEY MUST DO AND

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:48.889
DEMONSTRATE BEFORE THEY CAN

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:49.523
COMPLETE THAT.

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:51.125
SO MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THIS

01:38:51.191 --> 01:38:58.799
WILL NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT

01:38:58.866 --> 01:38:59.400
ON PEOPLE COMING INTO SPECIAL

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.602
WHAT [inaudible]

01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.969
GEN [inaudible]

01:39:02.036 --> 01:39:04.071
MY EXPECTATIONS BASED ON FIFTEEN

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:04.672
YEARS OF WORK IN PERFORMANCE

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:05.205
ASSESSMENT IS THAT IT WILL

01:39:05.272 --> 01:39:07.274
IMPROVE THEIR SKILL SET WHEN

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:08.309
THEY GET INTO THE CLASSROOM --

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:09.176
BUT I THINK WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.311
ATTENTIVE TO THE THINGS THAT

01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:10.878
ENABLE OR CONSTRAIN PEOPLE

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:12.579
MOVING INTO SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.448
ESPECIALLY.

01:39:14.515 --> 01:39:16.717
PRODUCTPERSISTENT SHORTAGE --

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:17.818
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AND I'M

01:39:17.885 --> 01:39:20.688
NOT SURE THAT PREPARATION IS.

01:39:20.754 --> 01:39:21.855
EVEN IF AMONG THE TOP FIVE

01:39:21.922 --> 01:39:23.691
REASONS WHY SPECIAL EDUCATORS

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:25.859
COME INTO OR STAY IN OR DESIRE

01:39:25.926 --> 01:39:26.493
TO LEAVE.

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.695
THEIR ISSUES AROUND WORKING

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:28.696
CONDITIONS ARE ISSUES AROUND

01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:31.732
CASELOADS OTHER KINDS OF YOU

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.701
KNOW CONTEXT IN WHICH SPECIAL

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:34.601
EDUCATION UNFOLDS.

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:36.670
THAT WE HAVE TO BE PAYING

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:38.205
ATTENTION TO KIND OF A CROSS

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:39.840
AGENCIES AS A STATE -- SO THAT

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:41.208
WE CAN PROVIDE THE KIND OF

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.943
ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TEACHERS

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:44.845
CAN GET THAT JOB DONE THE

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:45.846
LEARNERS ARE GETTING WHAT THEY

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:46.747
NEED.

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:52.186
THAT'S THAT'S MY VIEW ON THAT --

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:54.154
IN IN TERMS OF THE FEE.

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:55.956
ARE YOU ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT

01:39:56.023 --> 01:39:58.025
THE FEE AND HAVE EARNED REDUCING

01:39:58.092 --> 01:40:00.728
THE BACKLOG COULD WE WOULD

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:02.196
REVISIT THE FEET -- THIS IS THIS

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:02.896
RELATES TO OVERALL WE MOVED FROM

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:05.099
A FIFTY FIVE DOLLAR TO A SEVENTY

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:05.733
DOLLAR TO NOW A HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:40:05.799 --> 01:40:06.967
EVERY FIVE YEARS THAT'S TWENTY

01:40:07.034 --> 01:40:07.334
DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:40:07.401 --> 01:40:09.536
THE TEACHERS ARE PAYING FOR

01:40:09.603 --> 01:40:09.937
THEIR LICENSING.

01:40:10.003 --> 01:40:11.605
AND MY ARGUMENT JUST ON THE GET

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:13.774
GO IS THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT IF

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.876
THAT'S NOT A LARGE BURDEN FORD

01:40:15.943 --> 01:40:16.477
FOR TEACHERS FOR A CREDENTIAL

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:17.044
FEET.

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.746
AND THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:20.214
DISCIPLINE EVEN THOUGH WE'VE

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.949
GOTTEN RID OF THE BACKLOG OUR

01:40:22.015 --> 01:40:22.983
WORK LOAD IN TEACHER DISCIPLINE

01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:25.652
AN EDUCATOR DISCIPLINE HAS

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:29.990
INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY -- WE

01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:31.125
AND AT OCT I CAN I CAN GIVE YOU

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:31.725
MORE DETAIL ON THAT IF YOU'D

SUBSTANTIAL BUT THE WORKLOAD

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:35.062

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.830
THE STAFFING NEEDS HAVE

01:40:36.897 --> 01:40:39.032
INCREASED THE IS A AND THAT

ITSELF I MEAN WE ARE ABSORBING A

01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:42.736
GOOD PORTION OF THE FEE AND SO

01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:44.037

IN TERMS OF MANAGE THE WORK GETS

01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:48.909

THAT THAT FEE ITSELF.

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.848
OF IS IT NEEDS TO CHANGE IN

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:57.918
ORDER TO ADDRESS SHORTAGES OR TO

01:41:28.515 --> 01:41:30.417
IF IF MONIES ARE AVAILABLE AND

01:41:30.484 --> 01:41:31.652

01:41:33.654 --> 01:41:34.755
MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO

A PROGRAM THAT THEY USE -- HAS

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:42.022

CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THAT

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.829
DIRECTION THAT'S A DEMAND IS IS

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.063
THERE OF COURSE -- SHOULD BE AT

01:42:50.130 --> 01:42:51.698
ALL BE CONCERNED THAT THAT.

01:42:51.765 --> 01:42:52.833
FARRIGHT.

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:55.435
TABLE THAT PERCENTAGE OF

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:58.005
CREDENTIALED -- PERMITS EARNED

01:42:58.071 --> 01:42:59.873
IS STILL LOWER IS THAT JUST THE

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.441
KIND OF WORK IN PROGRESS -- THIS

01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:03.377
WORK IN PROGRESS LET ME EXPLAIN

01:43:03.443 --> 01:43:05.245
THAT SO -- FIRST FUNDING THAT

01:43:05.312 --> 01:43:08.181
CAME TO US IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:43:08.248 --> 01:43:08.749

GRANT PROPOSAL IF THEY RECEIVED

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:12.386
THEIR GRANTS BY THE SPRING OF

01:43:12.452 --> 01:43:13.053
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY AND ROLLED.

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.555
PEOPLE IN THEIR PROGRAMS IN

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:15.188
TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHICH

01:43:15.255 --> 01:43:16.623
WAS JUST LAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:18.091
TIME.

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:19.226
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN AT AN A A

01:43:19.293 --> 01:43:20.093
DEGREE OR HIGHER WHICH MEANS

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.094
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED AT LEAST

01:43:21.161 --> 01:43:24.631
TWO YEARS OF OF WORK TO GET YOUR

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:26.500
BACCALAUREATE DEGREE AND A AND A

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:28.135
CREDENTIAL THE THIRD YEAR FOR

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:28.468
CREDENTIALS.

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:30.070
THAT'S THREE YEARS OF FULL TIME

01:43:30.137 --> 01:43:31.972
WORK FOR MANY PEOPLE AND

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.740
CLASSIFIED SEVERAL WORKING FULL

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:34.241
TIME.

01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:43.283
SO THE EARLY YIELD ON THIS WOULD

01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:46.486
BE PEOPLE WHO CAME INTO THIS

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:48.322
PROGRAM AS CLASSIFIED STAFF

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:49.022
FORTY HAD A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE.

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:50.724
AND COULD MOVE QUICKLY TO GET

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:52.192
THEIR CREDENTIALS SO THIS IS THE

01:43:52.259 --> 01:43:53.427
EARLY LOW HANGING FRUIT IF YOU

01:43:53.493 --> 01:43:56.363
WILL WITHIN THE PROGRAM -- AND

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:58.231
IF WE EXPECT THAT IT WILL.

01:43:58.298 --> 01:44:01.635
FULLY OF MEET THE IN YOU WILL

01:44:01.702 --> 01:44:02.235
GET TO THE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED

01:44:02.302 --> 01:44:02.836
CANDIDATES BUT IT'S GOING TO

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:03.837
TAKE THREE TO FIVE YEARS I WOULD

01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:04.504
GUESS DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:05.105
THESE CANDIDATES CAN TAKE AWAY

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:07.741
FROM THEIR WORK TO DO FULL TIME

01:44:07.808 --> 01:44:10.377
STUDY TURN TO BE AN EVENTUAL.

01:44:10.444 --> 01:44:13.614
AND HOW MANY OF THEM HOW FAR

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.881
ALONG THEY ALREADY ARE

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:15.182
[inaudible]

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:16.483
YEAH OKAY.

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:17.484
AND HOW ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER

01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:18.919

HAD TWO YEARS AT OF THE PUBLIC

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:31.131

THEY TOOK TWO YEARS OF TIME WITH

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:45.078
THESE GRANTS TO DEVELOP THOSE

01:44:45.145 --> 01:44:45.712
PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED THEM AND

01:44:45.779 --> 01:44:46.980
THEY'VE BEEN ROLLED CANDIDATES

01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:48.015

A WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:55.522
COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT

ENROLLMENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS

01:44:57.457 --> 01:44:57.991
THE FIRST YEAR OF IN ROME AND

01:44:58.058 --> 01:44:58.859
WHAT'S YOUR PROJECTION IN TERMS

OF SPACE AND TIME IN RECRUITMENT

01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:01.895
EFFORT TO GET THERE.

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:04.965
BUT IF WE ASSUME THAT ALL FORTY

01:45:05.032 --> 01:45:11.605
ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS IT ROLL

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:12.272
THIRTY PEOPLE.

02:05:57.950 --> 02:06:00.452
PROGRAM AT ALL.

02:06:00.519 --> 02:06:01.954
ADDING SLOTS IS A REAL NEED BUT

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:03.689
WE CAN'T ASK FOR MORE SLOTS

02:06:03.756 --> 02:06:05.224
UNTIL THE FOUNDATION OF THESE

02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:06.525
PROGRAMS ARE FIXED.

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:08.227
EACH TIME THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE

02:06:08.294 --> 02:06:09.561
INCREASES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL

02:06:09.628 --> 02:06:11.397
FUNDING FROM THE STATE ASUS

02:06:11.463 --> 02:06:13.365
PROGRAM SINK DEEPER INTO DEFICIT.

02:06:13.432 --> 02:06:15.134
SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE

STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE 50%

02:06:17.369 --> 02:06:19.571

02:06:19.638 --> 02:06:20.806
9%.

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:22.374
YEARS OF UNDER FUNDING FOR THESE

02:06:22.441 --> 02:06:23.075
PROGRAMS.

02:06:23.142 --> 02:06:25.010
HAVE CAUSED.

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:26.378
THEM TO REDUCE THEIR OFFERINGS

02:06:26.445 --> 02:06:27.880
THAT HAVE MADE PROGRAM SO

02:06:27.947 --> 02:06:30.015
SUCCESSFUL.

02:06:30.082 --> 02:06:32.151
LAKE TUTORING STEM LABS ART

02:06:32.217 --> 02:06:34.053
CLASS THE LOSING HIGH QUALITY

02:06:34.119 --> 02:06:35.521
STAFF BECAUSE THEY CAN GET

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:37.056
BETTER PAY WITH LESS

02:06:37.122 --> 02:06:40.492
RESPONSIBILITY IN FAST FOOD.

TODAY PROGRAMS ARE STRETCHED TO

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:43.696
THE BREAKING POINT AND DON'T

02:06:43.762 --> 02:06:44.630

FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES.

02:06:56.041 --> 02:06:57.509
AND WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN ASUS

02:06:57.576 --> 02:06:58.711
FUNDING THEY WILL HAVE NO OTHER

02:06:58.777 --> 02:07:00.212

ADJUSTMENT.

02:08:06.478 --> 02:08:08.747
HE WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY

02:08:08.814 --> 02:08:09.948

ASUS AND IN OVER A DECADE.

02:08:26.632 --> 02:08:28.333
AT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS THE

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.037
9% INCREASE -- THE WAY THAT WE

02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:34.473

AS MUCH AS WE WERE ABLE TO GAIN

02:08:58.497 --> 02:09:00.566
FROM THAT FINDING INCREASE BACK

02:09:00.632 --> 02:09:01.834

OKAY.

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:11.610
AND AND THEN -- SO THERE THE

02:09:11.677 --> 02:09:14.847
REQUEST -- THIS YEAR IS -- IS

02:09:14.913 --> 02:09:17.483
THE AMOUNT YOUR CALL AMOUNTS THE

02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:19.618
THE REQUEST THIS YEAR IS A

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:20.219
HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT EIGHT

02:09:20.285 --> 02:09:21.186
MILLION.

02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:24.289
THAT'S TO THAT TAKES AN ACCOUNT

02:09:24.356 --> 02:09:27.159
THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES FROM

02:09:27.226 --> 02:09:29.461
TWENTY IN THE LARGEST ONES FROM

02:09:29.528 --> 02:09:32.431
TWENTY FOURTEEN TELL TODAY -- WE

02:09:34.633 --> 02:09:37.202
MEMBER CREO TO ALSO PROVIDE A

02:09:37.269 --> 02:09:40.205
COLA -- IN FUTURE YEARS GROWTH

02:09:40.272 --> 02:09:41.673
SO WE DO NOT KEEP COMING BACK

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.575
WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AS MINIMUM

02:09:43.642 --> 02:09:45.144
WAGE INCREASES AND ASK COST OF

02:09:47.246 --> 02:09:49.014
THE YEARS WE WE DON'T KEEP

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:51.250
CREATING THE SAME PROBLEM.

02:09:51.316 --> 02:09:53.385
YEAH I I THINK IT'S IT'S FAIR

02:09:53.452 --> 02:09:54.887
WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR I JUST AS

02:09:54.953 --> 02:09:56.855
PROGRAMS WITHIN THE STATE BUDGET

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:57.256
ARE.

02:09:57.322 --> 02:09:59.057
CERTAINLY -- PROPERLY EDUCATION

02:09:59.124 --> 02:10:01.260
PROGRAMS WE RECOGNIZED THAT WE

02:10:01.326 --> 02:10:02.528
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PAY OUR

02:10:02.594 --> 02:10:04.863
OUR WORKERS IN THIS FIELD --

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:07.332
WAGES AREN'T POVERTY WAGES AND

02:10:07.399 --> 02:10:08.300
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT

02:10:08.367 --> 02:10:10.636
DOING SO HAS AN IMPACT AND JUST

02:10:10.702 --> 02:10:13.972
SIMPLE MATHEMATICS SO THAT IF

02:10:14.039 --> 02:10:16.074
THOSE WAGES GO UP.

02:10:16.141 --> 02:10:17.609
FEAR STUDENTS SO WILL BE SERVED

02:10:17.676 --> 02:10:18.510
SO.

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:19.645
IF THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR

02:10:19.711 --> 02:10:21.079
WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE ON THE

02:10:21.146 --> 02:10:22.181
LINE THE LOSS OF PROGRAMS THE

02:10:22.247 --> 02:10:22.548
STUDENTS AGAIN.

02:10:22.614 --> 02:10:25.684
SO WE ARE ESTIMATING -- BASED ON

02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:27.819
OUR STATEWIDE SURVEY NEARLY ONE

02:10:27.886 --> 02:10:30.589
IN FOUR PROGRAMS EXPECT TO CLOSE

02:10:30.656 --> 02:10:31.657
THEIR DOORS ACROSS THE STATE.

02:10:31.723 --> 02:10:33.892
WITHOUT FINDING BY.

02:10:33.959 --> 02:10:34.893
TWENTY TWENTY AND SAID THAT

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:38.130
WOULD IMPACT ABOUT NINETY ONE

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:38.897
THOUSAND STUDENTS WOULD LOSE

02:10:38.964 --> 02:10:41.500
THEIR THEIR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM.

02:10:41.567 --> 02:10:43.068
AND WE KNOW THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE

02:10:43.135 --> 02:10:44.102
THESE HE'S PROGRAMS ARE IN HERE

02:10:44.169 --> 02:10:45.404
IN OUR PUBLIC TESTIMONY A LITTLE

02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:46.872
BIT THERE.

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:48.640
IN A VIABLE FOR WORKING.

02:10:48.707 --> 02:10:50.776
PARENTS BUT ALSO AS YOU SAID --

02:10:50.842 --> 02:10:52.444
KEEP KIDS OUT OF TROUBLE YOU

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:53.278
KNOW THE POLICE CHIEFS ALWAYS

02:10:53.345 --> 02:10:55.013
SAY BETWEEN THREE AND SIX IS

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.682
PRIME TIME FOR JUVENILE CRIME

02:10:56.748 --> 02:10:59.318
AND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS

02:10:59.384 --> 02:11:00.552
ABOUT SAYING IT ALL GO AND

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:02.254
COMMIT -- THAT STUFF BUT YOU

02:11:02.321 --> 02:11:05.290
KNOW KIDS BE KIDS SOMETIMES AND

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:06.458
SO HAVING THESE PROGRAMS.

02:11:06.525 --> 02:11:07.960
BETWEEN THREE AND SIX ARE ARE

02:11:08.026 --> 02:11:09.094
ARE CRITICAL ANOTHER THING THAT

02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:10.596
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:11:10.662 --> 02:11:11.997
ADDRESS THE LONG TERM NOT JUST

02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:13.732
GENERAL FUND IS THAT.

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:15.000
WE PUT ON THE BALLOT TWO YEARS

02:11:15.067 --> 02:11:16.902
AGO PROP SIXTY FOUR TO LEGALIZE

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:19.104
MARIJUANA AND WE SAID THREE

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:20.205
THINGS WE SHOULD TAX IT

02:11:20.272 --> 02:11:20.505
[inaudible]

02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:22.207
REGULATED.

02:11:22.274 --> 02:11:23.609
AND USE THE REVENUES FOR

02:11:23.675 --> 02:11:25.811
PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER SCHOOL

02:11:25.877 --> 02:11:27.479
PROGRAMS TO LITERALLY WAS ON THE

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:28.847
TV COMMERCIAL.

02:11:28.914 --> 02:11:29.982
IT WAS ON THE MAILERS TO

02:11:30.048 --> 02:11:32.484
PEOPLE'S HOMES AND IT WAS ON THE

02:11:32.551 --> 02:11:34.152
BALLOT ARGUMENTS AND SO.

02:11:34.219 --> 02:11:36.555
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HONOR

02:11:36.622 --> 02:11:37.823
THAT WILL AND THAT MONEY IS NOT --

02:11:37.889 --> 02:11:40.559
POURING IN -- JUST YET AND THE

02:11:40.626 --> 02:11:42.527
FIRST PART OF IT HAS TO GO TO TO

02:11:42.594 --> 02:11:43.996
PAY FOR SOME OTHER --

02:11:44.062 --> 02:11:45.564
COMMITMENTS AS FAR AS THE BALLOT

02:11:45.631 --> 02:11:47.199
MEASURE BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED

02:11:47.266 --> 02:11:48.133
TO HOLD ITS ON THAT ISSUE

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.401
THEY'RE THEY'RE A LOT OF IDEAS

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:51.136
HOW TO SPEND THAT MONEY.

02:11:51.203 --> 02:11:53.305
BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS A THIS IS

02:11:53.372 --> 02:11:54.906
AN EFFORT THAT WE KNOW MAKES

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:56.575
SENSE AND THIS IS ACTUALLY.

02:11:56.642 --> 02:11:58.644
WAS A COMMITMENT TO THE VOTERS

02:11:58.710 --> 02:12:00.045
OF CALIFORNIA.

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:01.613
SO MISTER GALLAGHER.

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.148

IS THAT WE CAP IT OFF AGAIN A

03:07:37.679 --> 03:07:38.614
THREE HUNDRED MILLION AS WE HAD

03:07:38.680 --> 03:07:39.548
BEFORE BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE

03:07:39.615 --> 03:07:41.450
FINALLY A STARTING. FOR THE

03:07:41.516 --> 03:07:43.552
PROCESS IT MAY NOT TAKE A WHOLE

03:07:43.619 --> 03:07:44.152
THREE HUNDRED MILLION BECAUSE

03:07:44.219 --> 03:07:45.320

03:07:49.391 --> 03:07:50.192
OUT OF THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION

03:07:50.258 --> 03:07:51.660

SOME OF THE CONSULTANTS OF THE

03:08:00.902 --> 03:08:01.436
BUDGET ABOUT THIS AND I THINK

03:08:01.503 --> 03:08:02.037
IT'S A REASONABLE REQUEST TO

03:08:02.104 --> 03:08:02.871
BASICALLY SAID IT BACK AT THREE

03:08:02.938 --> 03:08:03.472

03:08:03.538 --> 03:08:04.106
THE STANDARDS IN A PROCESS IN

03:08:04.172 --> 03:08:04.840
PLACE.

03:08:04.906 --> 03:08:06.141

03:08:06.208 --> 03:08:07.476
FOR THE GRANTS AND THOSE KINDS

03:08:07.542 --> 03:08:08.777
OF THINGS AND SO WOULD GIVES US

03:08:08.844 --> 03:08:09.845
A THREE YEAR.

03:08:09.911 --> 03:08:10.846
KIND OF PERIOD AGAIN TO

03:08:10.912 --> 03:08:12.514
BASICALLY LOOK AT THOSE SCHOOLS

03:08:12.581 --> 03:08:13.782
AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A A

03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:15.384
FULL TIME FRAME FOR THEM TO BE

03:08:15.450 --> 03:08:16.585
ABLE TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT

03:08:16.652 --> 03:08:17.419
THEY NEED.

03:08:17.486 --> 03:08:18.654
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON

03:08:18.720 --> 03:08:19.821
THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK AS WE

03:08:19.888 --> 03:08:21.156
GET WHEN WE GET THE AUDIT BACK

03:08:21.223 --> 03:08:22.924

03:08:22.991 --> 03:08:24.226
WORKING WHETHER THAT IT NEEDS

03:08:24.292 --> 03:08:25.761
MAJOR CHANGE IN MODIFICATION AND

03:08:25.827 --> 03:08:27.195
PROBABLY DOES.

03:08:27.262 --> 03:08:28.230
BUT IN THE INTRODUCED ILL HAVE

03:08:28.296 --> 03:08:29.831
THESE LOW PERFORMING KIDS WE

03:08:29.898 --> 03:08:30.899

THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO BE

03:08:34.336 --> 03:08:35.704

03:08:35.771 --> 03:08:36.972
RIGHT NOW IT IS THAT'S A REQUEST

03:08:37.039 --> 03:08:37.773
I UNDERSTAND THAT WAS THE

03:08:37.839 --> 03:08:39.975
UNDERSTANDING WE GOT CONFUSES

03:08:40.042 --> 03:08:40.575
SOME THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE

03:08:40.642 --> 03:08:41.576
GOVERNOR THOUGHT IT WAS THREE

03:08:41.643 --> 03:08:42.711
HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR.

03:08:42.778 --> 03:08:44.146

03:08:51.853 --> 03:08:53.021
OF MID YEAR ALLOCATION

03:08:53.088 --> 03:08:54.823
REQUESTING IS THAT THE THREE

03:08:54.890 --> 03:08:56.024
HUNDRED MILLION BE BASICALLY

03:08:56.091 --> 03:08:57.225
CAPPED AGAIN AT THAT NUMBER WAS

03:08:57.292 --> 03:08:59.528
PUT BACK IN WHAT WAS TAKEN OUT.

03:08:59.594 --> 03:09:01.630
SO IF SO IF -- IF WE SPENT FIFTY

03:09:01.697 --> 03:09:02.698
MILLION AND IT'S REALLY JUST

03:09:02.764 --> 03:09:04.266
OKAY PUTTING IT BACK AT THREE

03:09:04.332 --> 03:09:04.866
HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE NEXT

03:09:04.933 --> 03:09:06.501
YEAR YEAH SO THAT WAY WE CAN

03:09:06.568 --> 03:09:07.669
BEGIN TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

03:09:07.736 --> 03:09:08.737
THIS PROCESS OF THE LOW

03:09:08.804 --> 03:09:10.172
PERFORMING KIDS.

03:09:13.308 --> 03:09:15.811
THE OVERALL ILL CFF ONCE WE SEE

03:09:15.877 --> 03:09:17.412
WHAT ELSE EFF IS ACTUALLY DOING.

03:09:17.479 --> 03:09:18.647
