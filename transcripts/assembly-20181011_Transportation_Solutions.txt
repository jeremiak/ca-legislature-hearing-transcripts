GROUND LAST DECEMBER AND IT'S TWELVE POINT THREE MILES SIX STATIONS THROUGH SIX CITIES OR RIDERSHIP SHE IS AT HISTORIC LEVELS ARE WE'RE VERY PLEASE WITH METROS OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM AND THE SATISFACTION OF THE CUSTOMERS NOT JUST ON WEEKDAYS BUT ALSO ON THE WEEKENDS -- THE SEGMENT FROM GOING DOOR TO MONTCLAIR THE SHARED CORRIDOR -- RUNS OR WILL BE AND SS AND WITH METROLINK SO WE WILL BE BUILDING THIS PROJECT WITHIN THAT CHER TOWARD OR DIFFERENT TRACKS BUT WITHIN THE SAME HUNDRED FOOT REAL ROAD RIGHT AWAY OUR PROJECT IS GOING PLAN IN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN EACH OF THE CITIES -- WITH PLANNING NOT ONLY WHERE THE STATION IS GOING TO GO AND WHERE THE PARKING WILL BE BUT ALSO ACCESS AS WELL AS THE US THAT EQUIPMENT TO MEET STATION INCLUDING STATION COLORS AND ALL THE ENHANCEMENTS INCLUDING ARTWORK C. C. R. GLENDORA THERE'S LIVER AND MONA -- THE LAST TWO STATIONS -- OF THE SYSTEM CLERMONT AND MONTCLAIR AGAIN FULLY FULLY PLANNED WITH COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE WILL HAVE WORKING IN EACH OF THE FACILITIES -- METRO HAS RECENTLY UNDERGONE A CHANGE IN THEIR POLICY THEIR PARKING POLICY WHICH IS IT'S BEEN ADOPTED -- JUST JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WHICH REQUIRES OF A CHARGE FOR PARKING IN EACH OF THE STATION PARKING LOT SO THEY ARE LOOKING AT US TO LOOK AT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES THAT WERE PLANNED AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY CHANGE NOW THAT THAT ASSUMPTION FREE PARKING IS NO LONGER THAT THERE WILL BE CHARGED PARKING SO WE ARE LOOKING AT EACH OF OUR STATIONS SITE AND PROCESS ONCE YOU OVER THE NEXT YEAR ON A NEW NUMBER FOR EACH OF THE PARKING STRUCTURES A BIG PART OF OUR PROJECT IS FIRST MY LAST MILE PLANNING OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE WORK WITH THE CITIES AND NOW IT'S BEEN TURNED OVER TO METRO THAT IN THE MAIL MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE THE COG -- TO DO FIRST MY LAST NAME I'LL JUST NOT JUST PLANNING BUT ALSO IMPLEMENTATION SO THAT WORK IS UNDER WAY -- WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR METRO ON EACH OF THE CITIES WILL HAVE A PLAN TO UTILIZE OR SMILE LAST MILE DOLLARS AND BETTER CONNECT WITH EACH OF THE STATIONS ALONG THE FOOTHILL GOAL LINE LINE AHEAD OF ME HAVING PROJECT CHALLENGES THAT ARE ARE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT -- MENTION WE'RE IN A SHARED CORRIDOR -- WE WILL BE WORKING WITH METROLINK NB AND SS KEEP THEIR OPERATIONS OPEN DURING OUR CONSTRUCTION THEY STAY OPERATIONAL -- WE WORK AT NIGHT AND WE WORK IN A NON PEAK HOURS WILL BE IN THE SOUTH AND METROLINK TO MAKE SURE THE WORK GETS DONE SAFELY BUT ALSO KEEPING THEIR SYSTEM -- IN OPERATION AT ALL TIMES -- WE WILL BE RELOCATING IN THE CLERMONT METROLINK STATION ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FEET CHALLENGE TO THE PROJECT AS OUR TWENTY SIX AT GRADE CROSSINGS AND TWENTY FIVE ON A RENT RENOVATED BRIDGES -- WE HAVE WE HAVE COORDINATE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF THIRD PARTY CITIES OFFICES AS WELL AS TO COUNTY AND THE CONSTRUCTION -- DOLLARS THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING OUR BIDS ARE JUST RECENTLY COME IN THOSE BIDS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE IN A VERY DIFFERENT ECONOMY THAN WE WERE WE BUILT THE PREVIOUS PHASE OF THE PROJECT -- WITH -- XCELERATED ECONOMY -- OVERHEATED ECONOMY SOME PEOPLE SAY -- IN BEADS COMING IN VERY HIGH AND A LOT OF PROJECTS THAT WE SEE AROUND THE STATE SO WE'RE ANXIOUS TO COMPLETE EVALUATION OF OUR BIDS AND UNDERSTAND IF THAT'S GONNA HAVE ANY IMPACT TO OUR PROJECT WAS WE HAD AS I MENTIONED WE WE BROKE GROUND -- JUST LAST DECEMBER -- TO -- HAPPEN NEXT LIFELINE -- WHICH WAS THE UTILITY RELOCATION CONTRACT OF THIS CONTRACT WAS AWARDED TO AND ALLOWING US TO GET THAT WORK OUT OF THE WAY A LOT OF UNDERGROUND FACILITIES OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE NEW ALIGNMENT CONTRACTOR -- WE'VE BEGUN THAT PROCUREMENT AND WE EXPECT TO AWARD THE ALIGNMENT CONTRACT WHICH IS VIA ALMOST BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT LATER PART OF THIS YEAR WHEN THAT CONTRACT -- IS ON BOARD THEY WILL COMPLETE THE DESIGN OF THE FINAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING FOR THE PROJECT THE ENTIRE SEGMENT THAT INCLUDES THE RELOCATION OF THE BNSF THE METRO ON TRACK IN AND RELOCATE THOSE TRACKS AS THE FIRST PART OF THE PROJECT AND THEN THE SECOND PART AND FINAL PART WILL BE THE LIGHT REAL CONSTRUCTION ITSELF SO THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL -- JOB THIS -- THE RELOCATION OF ALL THOSE FACILITIES AND THAT'S WHY THIS PROJECT WAS ABOUT YOUR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OVERALL THE DB ONE CONTRACTOR AS I MENTIONED WAS RUSTIC AND THEY'VE COME IN AND THEY'VE RELOCATED UTILITIES -- THAT HAD TO BE MOVED AS PART OF THE -- PREPARATION FOR THIS PROJECT SLIDE SLIDE WITH REGARD DRUG PROCUREMENT MRS ARE A DESIGN BUILD PACKAGE NUMBER TWO GB TO -- WE ISSUES THE SHORTLIST PROPOSERS -- IN FEBRUARY -- THE BOARD APPROVE THAT WE WENT OUT TO THE INDUSTRY WITH OUR PROJECT PLAN OUR CONTRACT AND OR OR SENATE ENGINEERING PLANS INDUSTRY -- WE TOOK IT IN -- THEIR PROPOSALS -- THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED IN IN SEPTEMBER OF A JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ALMOST A MONTH AGO

NATIONWIDE -- PROBABLY ALL OVER THE WORLD WAS KIND OF LIKE REALLY SYSTEM SO WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE FOUR FOR HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEAMS OUR PROJECT ESTIMATE -- AND AGAIN I WAS LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THAT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE WHAT THE INDUSTRY WILL BRING TO THE TABLE -- WITH REGARD TO THEIR BID -- BUT AS WE SEE IS A GLENDORA MONCLER SEGMENT IS ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR -- THE PROJECT WITH ABOUT ANOTHER SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO -- GIVE US IN CLAREMONT TO MONTCLAIR -- THIS ENTIRE PART OF THE PROJECT THIS IS ALL ONE PROJECT AS WE SEE IT MONTHS THERE BECAUSE THOSE TO BE FUNDED THROUGH SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY DOLLAR SO HOW DID IT THAT WAY AND WE WILL WORK IT THAT WAY AS A OPTION TO THE CONTRACTOR WITH REGARD TO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OUR FUNDING SOURCES YOU CAN SEE THE MAJORITY OF THOSE FUNDS COMES TO MEASURE M. AND MEASURE ARE FUN WE ALSO HAVE A THREE PERCENT LOCAL MAPS OF EACH OF THE CITIES WILL PROVIDE KIND CONTRIBUTION OF STAFF SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT TO THE CONSTRUCTION -- SAMBAR YOU KNOW WE'LL BRING PROVIDING ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS -- FROM THERE LOCAL FUNDS AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OF CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS WHICH CLOSED OUR GAP YEAH UP WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PROJECT OBVIOUSLY -- AND WITH THE CAP AND TRADE OF COURSE THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SP ONE FUNDS AND -- IS VERY CRITICAL TO THE -- THE THE MOVING FORWARD OF THIS PROJECT ONE IMPORTANT ELEMENT THIS PROJECT COURSES TO YOU DO TRANSIT OR IN DEVELOPMENT IS KEY -- TO THE CITY'S GROW -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH EACH OF THE QUARTER CITIES SINCE TWO THOUSAND

ARCADIA ALL THE WAY TO MONTCLAIR HAS ADOPTED OR ISN'T ACOSTA SAYS ADOPTING A GENERAL PLAN OR SPECIFIC PLAN THAT LOOKS TO JOINT DEVELOPMENT AROUND EACH OF THE STATIONS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE

WITH FAMILIES AND AND PEOPLE LIVING IN THEM AND SO THESE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS -- HERE IN THE REGION I AND OTHER IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTERS THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMBING COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AND THIS IS A PROPER PROGRAM THAT'S INTENDED AT AND DESIGNED TO MAKE MY NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE INVESTMENT IN A SET OF INTEGRATED PROJECT SO IT'S A PLACE LEAST APPROACH WHERE WE REALLY LOOK AT BUILDING A COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS STRUCTURE TO TALK ABOUT -- HOW TO INVEST FUNDS TO MAKE A MAJOR TO CATALYZE TRANSFORMATION AND COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON EITHER SIDE PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON THE STATE'S MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE LOOKING AT INTEGRATED CLIMATE STRATEGIES AND OF COURSE THE CHIEF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS BUT ALONG SIDE HEALTH BENEFITS ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S AND SOME TRANSFORMATIVE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THIS PROGRAM I WE MADE OUR FIRST ROUND REWARDS IN THAT PROGRAM IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND WE MADE THREE AWARDS WE ALSO AWARDED FOR TEN PLANNING GRANT WOULD GET COMMUNITIES ON ON TRACK TO BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF IMPLEMENTATION GRANT -- THE EACH OF THESE PROJECTS ON TALKS ARE TO THAT ARE TWO OF THE INVESTMENTS FROM THE FIRST ROUNDER HERE IN THIS REGION PIECE OF THIS IS OR SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE IN EACH OF THESE PROJECTS SO ALONG SIDE THE INVESTMENT FROM THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSELLORS SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE DOLLARS NOW WE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF THE GROUNDS TO OF THIS PROGRAM YEAH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE IN THIS ROUND APPLICATIONS ARE DUE AT THE END OF THIS MONTH THAN WE ANTICIPATE MAKING WARDS LATER THIS YEAR ASSET TO THE TO THE PROJECTS I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT FROM ROUND ONE ONE IS -- IN ONTARIO AND THAT'S ON TERRIO TOGETHER AND AND THIS PROJECT RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT AND HAD JUST OVER US SIXTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF LEVERAGE AT JUST SPEAKING ABOUT THE COLLABORATIVE STRUCTURE THIS PROJECT HAS FIFTEEN PARTNERS APPLICATION WAS AT THE CITY OF ONTARIO THERE FIFTEEN PARTNERS WHO ARE IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THIS GRANT AND INCLUDES -- INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING SO -- HUNDRED AND ONE AFFORDABLE NEW HOUSING UNITS BUT ALSO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE SO OVER FIVE MILES BIKE LANES THREE MILES OF SIDEWALKS -- TRANSIT PASSES TO RESIDENTS -- AND ALSO A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT COMPONENTS TO DEVELOPMENT OF AN INCUBATOR -- TO HELP GENERATE JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY A SECOND ONE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN ROUND ONE WAS IN WHAT IN THIS WAS -- WITH THE LA COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY AS LEAD APPLICANT AGAIN ANOTHER ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THIS HAD SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE OF OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SEVENTEEN PARTNERS BRINGING TOGETHER AB SOME INVESTMENT INVESTMENT IN HOUSING SO OVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AT BUT ALSO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN EXPANDING TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS SO -- CARSHARING ELECTRIC TRICK TRICK HE'S ELECTION TRANSIT OPTIONS IN VAN POOL A LOT OF INVESTMENT OSMAN STREETS GAPING SO CREATING SAFE BIKE WAYS -- IN THE COMMUNITY EACH OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS REALLY AT A NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE SO ON A ON THE ORDER OF A COUPLE YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR SQUARE MILES BUT REALLY INTENDED TO BRING TOGETHER MULTIPLE PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT ALSO PROVIDE OTHER SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS -- TO THE COMMUNITY EVERYONE OF THE INVESTMENTS MADE UNDER THESE -- GRANT IS A TYPE OF PROJECT THAT WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS THEY ALL ARE THINGS LIKE URBAN GREENING INVESTMENTS AND -- IN SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- SO REALLY IS AN INTEGRATED PROGRAM SO ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE THAT WE PLAY AND WE THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ONE AT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL IS WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES TO ACCESS THE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INVESTMENTS PROGRAM AND SO WE DO THAT FOR OUR PROGRAM SERVICE FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM FOR A TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM I BELIEVE ALSO DO IT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER AGENCIES SO WE WORK WITH WHERE FOR INSTANCE CAL TRANS OR THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO APPLICANTS -- TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROJECTS IT LOOKS DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BUT WE DO THIS PROVIDING DIRECT ASSISTANCE DIRECT APPLICATION ASSISTANCE TO POTENTIAL APPLICANTS AND WE ALSO -- WILL OFTEN DO A LOT OF CAPACITY BUILDING IN COMMUNITY SO WORKING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS TO BUILDER RESOURCE BASE THAT CAN BE USEFUL ON THE GROUND HOW TO INTEGRATE AND ACCESS FUNDS ACROSS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS I AM SO WE'RE DOING THIS AS I SAID ACROSS IN OUR OWN PROGRAMS BUT ALSO WORKING ON SOLAR COMMUNITY SOLAR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS OF IN THIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO INCREASE THE THE SUCCESS RATE OF APPLICANTS AND SO IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR UNDER RESOURCE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH IS WHERE WE REALLY FOCUS THIS WORK I AND SO JUST CONCLUDE WITH TWO OTHER IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT AS DIRECTLY RELATED ON THE TRANSPORTATION FRONT BUT JUST WANTED TO TO MENTION BECAUSE I THINK THEY DO ROUND OUT VERY NICELY -- THE SUITE OF WHAT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO ANOTHER AREA OF INVESTMENT WHERE WE TAKE TEN PERCENT OF THE FUNDING AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM TO INVEST AND AGRICULTURAL AND OPEN AND AGRICULTURAL LAND CONSERVATION AND THIS IS REALLY TO MARRY TOGETHER THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSERVING OUR OPEN SPACE AND AGRICULTURAL LAND ALONG SIDE MORE COMPACT DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS -- AND SO WE HAVE TO DATE INVESTORS IN JUST OVER FIFTY EASEMENTS AND PROTECTED OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND AND THEN FINALLY -- IN THAT WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED FUNDING THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND TO SUPPORT CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM I THIS IS AT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON VERY POLICY ORIENTED RESEARCH SO INVESTING IN PROJECTS THAT HELP ADVANCE OUR REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO IN THE FIRST ROUND OF FINDING WHICH IS AWARDED IN JULY OF THIS YEAR WE HAD ABOUT TEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS WENT TO CALIFORNIA BASED INSTITUTIONS -- BUT I THINK IMPORTANTLY LOOK AT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT POLICY CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING IN IMPLEMENTATION SUCH AS DISPLACEMENT I'M THINKING ABOUT BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SO THESE ARE JUST PROJECTS WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THEY ALL HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT COMPONENT TO THEM SO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND USERS OF THAT RESEARCH AND SO WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WANTED TO JUST STAY THERE FOR JUST A MOMENT AND I'LL I'LL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE -- TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WAS FIRST LET ME JUST THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU WERE DOING THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL IS DOING TO SORT INTEGRATE SO MANY OF THE IMPORTANT WORK GOALS THAT THE STATUS AND TO SORT OF INTEGRATE THAT IN TERMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE USE OF G. R. F. OF FUNDING -- TO HATTIESBURG HELP US GET TO THE THE PLACE SO HE'S READY MORE FORMAL HOUSING WAS ALSO A SUSTAINABILITY AND REDUCING THE CARBON OUTPUT SO REGULATIONS ON THAT -- I I GUESS I GUESS BUT LET ME JUST ASK THIS QUESTION IN TERMS OF YOUR INTERACTING WITH LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES DO YOU HAVE ANY RECENT EXAMPLES OF HOW WE ARE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO HELP ADDRESS ISSUES OR PROBLEMS THAT MAY HAVE COME UP DURING THE COURSE OF YOUR PROJECTS OR HOW INTEGRATING IN A STRATEGY GOING FORWARD -- AS RELATED TO -- TRANSPORTATION YOU TALK ABOUT BIKE LANES AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT MAY BE PART OF IT BUT YEAH AND A CERTAIN -- IN SOME OF OUR INVESTMENTS -- WE ALSO ARE WORKING WITH LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES ON IT COULD BE POSSIBLE BUS SHELTER IMPROVEMENTS -- INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD INCREASE FREQUENCY OF THE BUS SERVICE THOSE ARE PARTS OR SOME OF OUR TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE UNITIES INVESTMENTS AND SO -- WE INTERACT WITH THEM IN A NUMBER OF WAYS OR AN ARE SPECIALLY ARE ORTIZ DO -- BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY A PART OF THESE TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING ALONG SIDE -- YOU KNOW AT EITHER AS PART OF THE WHOLE IN THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES INVESTMENTS OR AS PART OF AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES INVESTMENT THE SONG BABY YOUR STAND READY AS WELL WELL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE IF OF COURSE I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING SELECTED THE ERROR HAD GROW IT'S I THINK IT'S WHAT'S WONDERFUL ABOUT THAT AWARD IS OF COURSE THE HOUSING IN THE SENSE OF OF HOME FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE FAMILIES BUT ALSO HUNDRED HO TRANSFORMS THE COMMUNITY -- THEY WERE SO USED TO THE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT WERE THERE AT THAT SITE AND NOW TO HAVE IT TRANSFORM IT'S A TRUE TRANSFORMATION QUITE FRANKLY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR SELECTING THAT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I'M I'M GLAD ABOUT THERE'S A CONTINUOUS TWENTY PERCENT CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS OFTENTIMES WE HAVE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR FOR PROGRAM BUT TO KNOW THAT YOU WILL HAVE THIS CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS I THINK MAKES YOUR JOB EASIER BUT I'D LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THEM YEAH I MET UP YES IT DOES MAKE IT EASIER HER HOME I THINK IT ALSO THAT THAT EXAMPLE OF THEIR HEAD GROUP PROJECT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE WHICH IS TEN PORTANTINO HAD APPLIED IN THE PAST AND NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT HAVING A CONTINUOUS PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND HAVING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PLEASE ALLOW US TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO CONTINUE WORKING -- WITH SAN BERNARDINO AND TO GET TO SUCCESS AND NOW I HOOK SEEING HOW THEY CAN ACHIEVE SUCCESS AT AND HOW THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM CAN WORK FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT LONGEVITY TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO MARRY A PROGRAM THAT IS AVAILABLE WITH COMMUNITY NEEDS -- AND THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT'S TRUE -- FOR A LOT OF THESE INVESTMENTS PROGRAMS OR TO HAVE -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO GET MONEY RIGHT AWAY BUT IF YOU'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO MODIFY TO GET SOME ASSISTANCE AND COME BACK AGAIN MAYBE TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY IN A NEW WAY I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND VERY VALUABLE WONDERFUL THANK YOU YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL START WITH LOUISE AND SHE IS THERE TO SEE YOU UP THANK YOU FOR THE TWENTY MILLION FOR THE HOUSING AND THEN OF COURSE THE TCC MONEY THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR ONTARIO ARE WE ON TIMELY BUT THOROUGHLY ENJOYED GETTING TO KNOW THE SEARCH TV CROWD -- GROWTH COUNCIL AND THE WORK THAT YOU DO MY QUESTION IS OF THE NEXT ROUND OF GRANTS HOW DO YOU PLAN TO BREAK THOSE DOWN THE LAST TIME IT WAS THIRTY FIVE MILLION FRONT TERRIO SEVENTY MILLION FOR -- LA OUR FOR FRESNO AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR LOOKING AT THIS TIME WE HAVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS TIME ULTIMATELY IT IS IT IS A DECISION OF OUR COUNCIL -- EACH OF OUR APPLICANTS I THINK WE'RE HERE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN ANTICIPATING WE DO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR APPLICANTS AND JUST WAITING FOR IMPLEMENTATION GRANT APPLICATIONS IN THIS ROUND WE'VE INSTRUCTED THEM TO -- SUBMIT APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR -- PROJECTS OF THE THE IF IF WE SEE IF THE COUNCIL GOES FORWARD WITH THAT WE WOULD END UP WITH TWO APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT GREAT VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MY NEXT QUESTION IS FOR HOW BE REGARDING OUR GOLD LINE BUT I FIRST HAVE TO HAVE TO PUT IN A LITTLE PLUG FOR THE MILLENNIALS I HAVE NO PROBLEM OF TWO TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD MILLENNIALS HOLES LIVE ON THEIR OWN SUSTAIN THEMSELVES HAVE A GOOD SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND EVEN TAKE A MOMENT OUT TO DINNER OCCASIONALLY BUT I WILL SAY THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A BIG HOUSE WITH A LOT OF PROPERTY THEY WANT A SMALLER FOOTPRINT THEY LIKE THEIR LEFT IN THERE WHO WERE AND THEY LIKE AMAZON SO I THINK I'VE GOT GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M CAN YOU SHARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF THE GRADE SEPARATIONS AND THE INCREASE IN THE COST WITH US WELL WE HAVE ANTICIPATED ALL THE GRADE SEPARATIONS IN OUR BUDGET WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE ONE WHICH WAS ADDED AFTER OUR BUDGET TIMES THAT'S ABOUT A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR HIT YOU ARE BUDGET THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- ONCE WE GET THROUGH THIS PROCUREMENT PROCESS WITH REGARD TO THE GRADE SEPARATIONS THEMSELVES -- THEY ARE -- EACH OF THEM ARE UNIQUE EACH OF THE COMMUNITIES WE GO THROUGH -- WE SHUT DOWN A CERTAIN STREETS FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME PRE DETOUR SO THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES ON THE GROUND WITH WORKING WITH THE CITY'S -- AND THEN WITH REGARD TO THEIR QUEUE SEASON APPROVES THESE CROSSINGS WE'VE GONE THROUGH A PROCESS OF STARTING ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO GETTING COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OF THESE CROSSINGS GETTING THEIR APPROVAL OR AT LEAST A CONDITIONAL APPROVAL ON THE DESIGNS TO THE SO I THINK WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE AT EACH OF THESE CROSSINGS BUT FOR SOME OF THE FINANCIAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY THIS TECHNICAL OF CONSTRUCTION ISSUES THAT WE WILL FORCE SOURCING WHERE WOULD YOU GO FOR THAT ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION WELL WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS ONCE WE GET THIS PROCUREMENT METRO ARE OFTEN AGREEMENT OUR PARTNERS AT METRO -- ALWAYS ANTICIPATING THAT BECAUSE THESE ARE ESTIMATES -- THESE ESTIMATES WERE CREATED TO IN FOUR YEARS AGO -- WE KNOW WHEN WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO -- WITH NIGHTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO YOU INTO A VERY HOT ECONOMY AND THAT ESCALATION IS MUCH HIGHER THAN WE ANTICIPATED AND WHEN WE WENT TO THE SUPREME WITH METRO WE HAVE SERIES OF STEPS THAT WE WILL GO THROUGH -- TO FIND OTHER MONEY MAKE CHANGES TO THE PROJECT EVERYTHING FROM MINOR CHANGES TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES INCLUDING CHANGING THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT WHICH WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MAY HAVE TO DO -- LOOKING DEPENDING ON WHAT WE'RE THE ESTIMATES COMMITTEE WILL ALSO HAVE POTENTIAL OF COMING TO THE STATE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE AROUND -- IN LOOKING AT OTHER POTENTIAL FINANCING OF THE JOB THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT MORE ECONOMICAL IF IT COMES TO THAT OKAY SO MY WORRY MY CONCERN IS THAT ORIGINALLY THE MONEY THAT YOU CAME TO THIS CAT CAT TO THE STATE FOR THROUGH CAP AND TRADE WAS FIFTY FIVE MILLION AND THEN A BALLOON TO TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION ULTIMATELY WE APPROVE THAT AND GIVE THAT TO YOU I'M NOT I'M NOT GONNA LIE WAS IT'LL FRUSTRATE WITH THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS ALMOST SIX TIMES MORE THAN WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY ASKED FOR SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THE BEST USING OUR CRACK CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS AND THAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO CONTROL THOSE COSTS YES I THINK I THINK WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY WERE RIGHT NOW IT'S REALLY AT THE MERCY OF THE CONTRACTORS WE HAVE FOUR BIDDERS OF THOSE BIDS ARE BEING REVIEWED RIGHT NOW ECONOMY WHERE THESE KIDS COME IN AT AND -- YOU KNOW I THINK AS LONG AS OF OUR ENGINEERS ARE ENGINEERING A SOLID -- I THINK WE'VE WE'VE ANTICIPATED MOST EVERYTHING WITH REGARD TO THE PROJECT WAS THE ACCEPTANCE ONE GRADE SEPARATION THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE THE DOLLARS GOING UP WE HAVE TO SAY WE HAD THE SEVERAL SEPARATE SEPARATIONS THAT WERE ADDED TO THE PROJECT ABOUT ACCOUNTED FOR -- THINKING THE CITY'S UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT VERY VERY WELL THEY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT THE UNKNOWNS FOR US ARE REALLY THE ECONOMY AND WHERE THE BIDDERS COME IN OKAY OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU WHETHER QUESTIONS REALLY FOR BOTH YOU AND SIGN IF THE PROPOSITION SIX IS GOES THROUGH AND SB ONE IS REPEALED WHAT DO WE DO NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO I KNOW THAT YOU CANNOT -- ACTIVELY CAMPAIGN FOR SOMETHING BUT BUT SINCE THIS DIRECTLY AFFECTS BOTH OF YOU DO WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE VOTING NO ON PROPOSITION SIX WELL FROM THE CONSTRUCTION THIRTY STANDPOINT ARE WHEN ARE THIRTY IS TAKING THE POSITION IN -- IN OPPOSITION -- ARE BELIEVE OUR UNDERSTANDING IS OUR FUNDS THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS CAP AND TRADE THAT'S ALL PART OF A LARGER PACKAGE OF WHICH THE SP ONE FUNDS -- COME SUMMERS COMES FROM THOSE FUNDS -- IT WILL HAMPER OUR PROJECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT -- IT'S A IT WILL BE A HUGE GAP IF IT COMES DOWN TO THAT OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THEN AT THAT IT JUST SAYS SO WE WE WE HAVE A LOT OF EDUCATION TO DO ABOUT THE ONE AND WE'RE DOING THAT AND I THINK ALL THE AGENCIES -- PARTICIPATING OF DOING THAT BUT BUT THIS ALSO IMPORTANT TO THE MINE THE PUBLIC THAT'S NOT NOT JUST A REGULAR WISPY ONE IT IS ALSO THE FUTURE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING YES THAT MEANT WILL PROBABLY BE POSSIBLE TO GET SO IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF NOT HAVING A DISPUTE

DOUBLES AS OUR OFFICE SPACE ADJACENT TO THE BEE AND SS IN A MORAL DISABILITY IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE CITY OF SAN MARINO A TO THE HARD PART OF THAT CITY AT HE IN RIALTO STREET JOINING AT A AT A TRANSIT CENTER -- CREATING CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN A BUS RAPID TRANSIT LINE THE GREEN LINE OPERATED BY ON THE TRANS FROM CAL STATE SAN MARINO TO THE NORTH OR THE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY TO THE SOUTH AND

MUCH LIKE TODAY AND INTERMIXED WITH FOR EIGHT AND WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT POINT AS WELL ON A FEW MINUTES SO NOW I WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT KIND OF WHERE WE ARE MOVED BACK TO KIND OF THIS PORTION OF THE WESTERN PORTION OF OUR COUNTY AND AND THEY CAN ACTIVITY TO THE EASTERN PORTION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO OR AGENCY COMPLETED AN INTERNAL STUDY THAT LOOKED AT AND DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES TO BRING TRANSACTIONS -- INTO THE ONTARIO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PROPERTY AND WE WE STARTED WITH A VERY BROAD SUITE OF OPTIONS AND NARROWED IT DOWN TO REALLY TO ALTERNATIVES ONE BEING AN EXTENSION OF THE GOAL LINE FROM MONTCLAIR DOWN TO THE ONTARIO PROPERTY AND THE SECOND BEING A CONNECTION OUT OF THE RANCHO CUCAMONGA STATION CLOSE TO WHERE WE ARE HERE INTO THE AIRPORT PROPERTY CONNECTING AND METROLINK SYSTEMS DOWN INTO THAT PROPERTY -- BOTH OF THEM ARE LOOK AT THE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THE ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE ASKED IN THE STUDY WAS THE BENEFIT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP RIGHT HERE AND I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE A POINTER WITH THESE THESE THE WAY WE'RE PRESENTING HERE TODAY BUT I MEAN THE GOAL LINE EXTENSION ESSENTIALLY CUTS THROUGH THE WESTERN EDGE OF SAM'S COUNTY AND SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE TAXPAYERS OF SAN BENITO COUNTY OF THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE FUNDING ON ANY ANY INVESTMENTS THIS TO ANY CONNECTIONS TO THE ONTARIO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT CONTRIBUTION AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY INDEED ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT -- SIGNIFICANTLY AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE PARAMETERS OF THE WE'RE CONTINUING TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS WE LOOK AT WHAT IS THE RIGHT INVESTMENT TO GET INTO THE AIRPORT PROPERTY ANOTHER STUDY THAT WE JUST RECENTLY COMPLETED WAS WITH LA A METRO AND IT REALLY GETS BACK TO USE MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE THE DM USE THE EIGHT MEETING FIRE'S CRASH COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND SO THEY CAN OPERATE ON EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE EXISTING WE STUDIED WITH LA MEASURE THE IDEA OF OF REPLACING OFF PEAK METROLINK SERVICE WITH THE DMU SERVICE ALL THE WAY INTO TO UNION STATION -- THERE'S A A PINCH POINT -- JUST EAST OF EL MONTE IS YOU GET PAST -- LAKE CITY COLLEGE IF YOU KNOW YOUR RUNNING THROUGH THE THE CENTER OF THE FREEWAY THERE -- AND SO THERE'S SOME DIFFICULTIES TRYING INTERVIEWS MORE FREQUENT SERVICE IN THAT PORTION -- BUT CERTAINLY FOR A VERY LIMITED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO A LARGELY JUST PURCHASES VEHICLES YOU CAN ENTITIES SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FREQUENCIES -- ON THAT LINE THEN YOU HAVE TODAY DURING OFF PEAK HOURS AND THE REASON IS THAT SENATE'S ORDER -- AND BE POINTED TO THIS -- ALONG THE GOAL LINE WE'RE SEEING TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT CROPPING UP ALL ALONG THE SAME READING A LINE IN BOTH COUNTIES AND SO THE DEMAND AND THE TWO YEAR DEEP BRAIN IS DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT MODEL THAT METRO X.'ERS WHICH IS A COMMUTER SERVICE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON MOVING PEOPLE FROM THE OUTLYING COMMUNITIES INTO DOWNTOWN LA AND THEN BACK IN THE EVENINGS -- YOU'RE GONNA HEAR A IN A FEW MINUTES FROM STEVE SOCKS YOU MENTIONED MR CHAIR TO THAT HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SKAGGS STUDIES REALLY LOOKED AT THE INTER CONNECTED MIDI ISSUES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTIES AND I WANT TO THANK US ON AND THINK STEVEN AND THE TEAM THAT WORKED ON THAT IT'S IT'S BEEN A LONG LABORIOUS PROCESS BUT AN IMPORTANT PROCESS TO REALLY TRY TO HONE IN ON WHAT IS THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS MOVING FORWARD AND THE RECOMMENDATION ARISING OUT OF THAT IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE WORK -- AND AND WE HAD TO SPC TA OR ARE CERTAINLY WELCOMING THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE WE'VE ALREADY THE DISCUSSION AT THE AIRPORT WE BROUGHT TOGETHER INDUSTRY LEADERS INCLUDING YES ARE A MAJOR ROAD GIS COMPANY WORLDWIDE PLAYER IN THAT FIELD OUT OF RED LINES WE BROUGHT IN IS BROUGHT IN ON UNIVERSITY CAL STATE -- SIMMONS UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO A REPRESENTATION AS WELL AS MY AGENCY TO REALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD TO CREATE THAT CAN ACTIVITY -- IT'S BECOMING THE WARM WARM PART YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM ALLEN WANT IF YOU MINUTES -- ON KIND OF THE PROJECTIONS FROM THE AIRPORT AND WHEN AND WHY THIS IS BECOMING AN ISSUE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH VERY QUICKLY BUT -- WE'RE ACTUALLY OF THE ROUND TABLES CONVENING AGAIN IN MID NOVEMBER AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE AIRPORT -- ON THE PASSENGER DEMAND GROWTH EXPECTED THROUGH TWENTY FORTY -- FROM WHERE IT IS TODAY AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT RAMP UP WE'RE ALSO GOING TO START TALKING ABOUT HOOD OF A STATION CITING ON OR NEAR THE ONTARIO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PROPERTY -- WE'RE GONNA GONNA GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE SKETCH THAT HE THAT YOU'LL ALSO HEAR TODAY'S REPORTING OUT ON RESULTS AND THEN DISCUSS WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS ARE AND IT'S IMPORTANT AGAIN -- GIVEN THE THE GROWTH PROJECTIONS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS DIALOGUE FORWARD -- YOU CAN HEAR I THINK SMART LATER ON THIS PANEL AS WELL ABOUT -- THE SUCCESS THIS METROLINK IS HAD AND THEIR SCORE APPLICATION IT'S A A GREAT INVESTMENT BY THE STATE RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE METROLINK SERVICE THROUGHOUT -- THE FIVE COUNTY REGION AND -- ONE OF THE KEY THINGS ON THE SAN BERNARDINO ONLINE IS A RECOGNITION THAT WE NEED TO AT LEAST GET TO THIRTY MINUTES BI DIRECTIONAL SERVICE FREQUENCIES AND SO THERE'S THIS FUNDING IN THAT PLAN TO HELP US GET THERE THERE WITH AGAIN THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE THE GROWING LEAD THAT TOT ALONG THIS LINE BOTH COUNTIES IS BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT OF THE RIDERSHIP ON DECEMBER EIGHTEEN ONLINE IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE ENTIRE METROLINK SERVICE AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT AGAIN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT CONNECTIONS TO MAKE INTO THE AIRPORT PROPERTY UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS AS MUCH LIKE SERVICE IN THE DMU SERVICE WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT AGAIN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OPEN UP NOT ONLY THE EAST VALLEY BUT PEOPLE THAT COME FROM AS FAR AWAY AS THE COACHELLA VALLEY CAN NOW USE TRANSIT ONCE THEY GET INTO THE SAME READING OF THE ALLEY TO REALLY GET ANYWHERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY EXCITING TIMES BUT THE SAM READING ONLINE ALSO LATELY WE DO TALK ABOUT CONNECTIVITY THE AIRPORT NOT ONLY HELPS BRING IN PEOPLE FROM THE EASTERN PART OF THIS COUNTY AND IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY BUT ALSO FROM LA COUNTY FROM UNION STATION ALL THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT PROPERTY SO THERE'S I THINK THURMOND THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DO IF WE COULD GO TO THE LAST SLIDE I THINK ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BCT A FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS NOW I TALKED ABOUT THE DIESEL MULTIPLE UNITS AND THIS IS AN IMAGE OF WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY FOR CARING FOR OUR REDLANDS PASSIONATE RAIL SERVICE AND YOU SEE THERE'S THREE VEHICLES THEY'RE THEY'RE CONNECTING THERE'S A LEADING AND TRAILING CAR THERE -- INTERCHANGEABLE SO THE TRAIN CAN MOVE BACK AND FORTH AT WILL BUT -- IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS THE -- THE POWER OUR VEHICLE THE POWER AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY HAVE DIESELS CHAIR FOR DIESEL GENERATORS AND THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THAT'S THE CLEANEST DIESEL TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT THERE TODAY BUT WE ARE YOU ARE YOU BEING IN THE WORST AIR QUALITY BASES IN THE COUNTRY THAT THAT WASN'T WHAT IT ENOUGH AND WE'RE INTRODUCING THE SERVICE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT MADE SENSE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU PAID ATTENTION TO WHAT TEST LESS THAN DOING AND AND THE ADVANCEMENTS IN ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY VEHICLES -- AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OF THE SPECTRUM AND SO WE DID DID WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS LAST ROUND HE -- GRANTS FOR -- THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO PURCHASE EIGHT ANOTHER VEHICLE AND TOOK AND TYLER ZERO OR NEAR ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY EXCITING BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN NORTH AMERICA AND WORD WORD WORD MOVING THIS FORWARD -- HERE IN SAN BENITO COUNTY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD COMPLETELY RESHAPED THE METROLINK SERVICE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WE COULD HAVE A BATTERY POWER TRAININGS THAT ARE RUNNING THROUGH OUR COUNTY AND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AGAIN USING THE EXISTING TRACKS NOT HALF AND TO BUILD NEW SIGNIFICANTLY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE SO EXCITING TIMES WERE NOT JUST TIED TO THE IDEA OF BATTERY TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO LOOKING AT FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY AND SO IT TRULY IS A PILOT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BEST APPROACH IS WITH THAT'LL THAT'LL CLUED IN AND CERTAINLY ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND WE WILL -- WILL COME UP ART LEAHY ARTISTS YOU MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE TO THE -- PODIUM THE AND LET ME ALSO A RECOGNIZE AND INTRODUCE MY GOOD FRIEND OF THE MIRROR OF RANCHO CUCAMONGA DENNIS MICHAEL WHO WAS ABLE TO JOIN US IS SO BEAR WITH US WELCOME YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY ALLOWS USERS YOUR GREAT CITY GOOD MORNING A PLACE A LOW TIER OF FATHER FORM I WOULD DO SO -- BACK A FEW DECADES THANK YOU -- -- I'M GONNA HAVE A POWER POINT HERE TO SHOW YOU IN JUST A MOMENT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS MAKES METALINK RIDERSHIP IS ACTUALLY UP AND -- IS YOU KNOW THIS THAT'S VERY UNIQUE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE MOST TRACK TO SYSTEMS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF RIDERSHIP -- PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS WAS A VERY INNOVATIVE PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO -- ELECTION WHICH I'VE NEVER SEEN TO SUCCESSFULLY CUT CUT AIRS ON THE ANTELOPE VALLEY LINE WHICH HAS ALL THE SERVICE MUCH LUCK ASSEMBLY IN THE LINE OF WRITER CHAIR CLIMBS AND SO THE OVER TIME OF WITH INCREASED RIDERSHIP XTC ACHIEVED A FARE CUT WHICH WAS REVENUE NEUTRAL ARE I'VE NEVER I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT MY CAREER BEFORE IT'S ALWAYS A WILL BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN SO IN JULY WHEN WE REDUCE THE FARES ON A SALMON IN A LINE TO RECEIVE THE SAME THING RIDERSHIP GROWTH GROWTH AND I BREAKING EVEN YET BUT THAT WILL CERTAINLY BE OUR OUR GOAL REMAINS IN THE SCORE PROGRAM A METAL MAKE RECEIVE OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF RACERS TYPES OF STATE MONEY A FEW MONTHS AGO -- WITH THIS WILL BE WORKING ON IMPROVE SIGNAL SYSTEMS DOUBLE TRACKING TROUBLE TRACKING WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT MOST OF OUR SYSTEMS A TWO THIRDS OF IT IS SINGLE TRACK LIKE A ONE LANE ROAD ROAD ONE LEBRON WITH BI DIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF THAT LAND GETS BLOCKED FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER EVERYTHING COMES TO A STOP IT LIMITS THE FREQUENCY OF THE SERVICE AND ALSO ON TIME PERFORMANCE ALSO BY CLINTON'S PROGRAM IN THE STATE ARE WE WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE MORE FREQUENT SERVICE WAS WITH BETTER RELIABILITY IN FACT ONE OF THE THINGS I'M TALKING TO FOR EXAMPLE BURBANK AIRPORT ABOUT IS WHAT IF WE CAN GET TO THIRTY MINUTE OR FIFTEEN MINUTE FREQUENCIES FROM UNION STATION UP TO BURBANK AIRPORT I THINK ULTIMATELY WE ARE BE ARE ARE PUTTING THE SAME KIND OF FREQUENCIES ON THE SALMON IN A LINE IN THE ORANGE COUNTY LINE A LOTS OF GOOD THINGS OUT THERE HAPPEN I DO WHEN I KNOW FOR YOU THAT THAT ARE IN THE NATION OF POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL THIS ALL FLOWED FROM THE CHATSWORTH ACCIDENT WHICH IS A LITTLE OVER TEN YEARS AGO WHICH RESULTED IN VERY SERIOUS ISSUES -- ISSUES DEADLINE OF -- DECEMBER THIRTY ONE HAPPY TO SEE AND PLACES WE WILL BE FINE WITH THAT WORKING WITH AMTRAK AND WITH THE FREE OF ROADS I THINK WILL BE OKAY REYNOLDS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO WILL NOT BE COMPLIANT -- AND RIGHT NOW THE FRA IN THE IN THE CONGRESS AND TO BE NO MORE EXTENSIONS FOR SO -- IT'LL BE AN INTERESTING YEAR NEXT YEAR TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS BY THE WAY ATC HAS COST A LOT OF MONEY OF WE WE DID THIS BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE WITH THE ACCENT BACK WHEN WHEN OUR BOARD MEMBERS WERE COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO SAFETY AS A NUMBER ONE VALUE AND PRIORITIES SO I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT METROLINK IS EIGHTY FIVE COUNTY JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY -- WE RUN SERVICE IN SIX COUNTIES OUR FUNDING COMES PRIMARILY THROUGH THROUGH THE THE COUNTIES I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE MENTAL EXIST AS A COMMUTER RAILROAD THAT GENERATES A GREAT DEAL OF STATE AND LOCAL MONEY WHICH THEN GOES TO THE COUNTY SOMEONE OFFSETTING INVESTMENT WHICH THEY MAKE AND AND TO US WE RENT AMOUNT THREE HUNDRED TRAINS A DAY -- WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES OF RUN AWAY MUCH OF WHICH IS MOST OF WHICH AS I SAID IS A SINGLE TRACK RIGHT NEXT MAYES SO THERE'S A MAP OBVIOUS YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR SYSTEM OF PARALLELS THE FIVE NORTH AND SOUTH OF ONE THIRTY FOUR OF THE SIXTY THE TEN OF A NINETY ONE -- THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WILL COME BACK TO THAT IN A MINUTE AND LET ME JUST OBSERVE BEFORE I GO FORWARD THAT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR FREEWAY SYSTEM IS BASICALLY AT FIXED CAPACITY WHEN I WAS IN ORANGE COUNTY I THOUGHT WE WOULD WIDEN FREEWAYS ARE DOUBLE DECK FREEWAYS THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN THE PUBLIC WILL NOT ACCEPT SO WE HAVE BASICALLY A FIXED CAPACITY FREEWAY SYSTEM THERE WON'T BE ANY NEW FREEWAYS IN THE LA BASIN OTHERS ONE PROJECT IN ORANGE COUNTY IN THE MIDDLE OF FOUR OR FIVE FEW PROJECTS AND SAM AND DEAN OR OVERSIZED AT SOME POINT THE FREEWAYS ARE DONE SO WE CONFRONT GROWING POPULATION WHICH IS SPREADING OUT BECAUSE OF HOUSING COSTS IN THE IN THE INNER PART OF THE COUNTIES US WITH A GROWING POPULATION SPREADING OUT PRETTY MORE DEMAND ON THE FREEWAYS WITH A FIXED CAPACITY FREEWAY SYSTEMS NO -- I DON'T GO ON THE WEST SIDE OF LA ANYMORE MORE OF YOU KNOW IT'S TOO MISERABLE TO GET OVER THERE TO UNLESS I AM FORCED TO I DON'T DO IT -- I WOULD GO THERE TO WATCH AND SEE IF YOU SELL A HOWEVER THAT WOULD BE IT THAT WOULD BE A MERITORIOUS UP SO IT'S IMPORTANT THESE THESE THESE LINES CARILLO THE FREEWAY SYSTEM RUN COME BACK TO THAT -- AND SHOW THAT MITCHELL MAKE IS ACTUALLY AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT FOR THE COUNTIES AND OTHERS EXPLICITLY SO -- IF WE MEASURE OF YOUR RIDERSHIP AS WE DID FOR DECADES AS BOARDINGS METAL LIKE A SMALL FORTY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND A DAY COMPARED TO ONE AND A HALF MILLION AT METRO I SOUNDS VERY SMALL BUT THE TRIPS ARE MUCH LONGER THAN THEY ARE ON ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUSES ORDERS OR RAIL LINES TO THE AVERAGE TRIP LENGTH MIGHT BE FOUR MILES FOR A HALF THREE AND A HALF MILES OUR TROOPS OR ABOUT THIRTY MILES LONG SO BECAUSE THEN IF YOU MEASURE RIDERSHIP IN TERMS OF PASSENGER MILES THEN METROLINK IS THE SECOND BUSIEST CARRIER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AFTER METRO BUT HIGHER FOR EXAMPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY RIVERSIDE COMBINE BECAUSE OF CRIPPLING THING THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE ARE CARS OFF THE FREEWAY NEXT PLEASE SO -- ARE FAIRS COVER ABOUT FORTY FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF OUR OPERATING BUDGET THAT IS HIGHER THAN OTHER CARRIAGES OF THE CALIFORNIA BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT LA IS NOW I THINK ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT WERE AT FORTY OF CELLS OF THE USERS ON METROLINK ARE PAYING A BIGGER PERCENTAGE OF THE FREIGHT RATE THAN THEY ARE OTHER BOYS IN AND RAIL SYSTEMS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEXT NEXT SO IF WE IF WE THEN TAKE THOSE FINGERS TOGETHER ALONG ON THE LONG TRIPS IF THE HIGH PASSENGER MILES AND THE HIGH FAIRS WHAT WE SEE IS THERE'S A VERY LOW SUBSIDY PER PASSENGER MILE ON METAL LIKE MUCH ALIKE IS THE ORANGE ONE UP THERE ARE NOT QUITE AS AS LOW AS AN OLD VALLEY WHICH IS A LONG DISTANCE BUS CARRIER FROM AN OLD VALLEY DOWN TO LA BUT MUCH LOWER THAN OTHER SYSTEMS AROUND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT CENTS GOODBYE NOW IF WE TAKE THAT NUMBER AND SUBTRACT FROM IT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WHICH METROLINK GENERATES THE STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS WHICH GO TO THE COUNTIES NEXT SLIDE PLACES WE COME OUT WITH THE NET NEUTRALITY SUBSIDY OR COST PER PASSENGER MILE ACOSTA LA METRO ABOUT TEN CENTS FOR EVERY PASSENGER MILE THAT OCCURS WITHIN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN ORANGE IS A LITTLE LESS THAN THAT YOU SEE SAM READY ON RIVERSIDE AFFAIRS WELL MENTOR MENTOR IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THIRTY CENTS PER PASSENGER MILE BUT EVEN THEN THAT IS VERY CHEAP COMPARED TO OTHER TRANSIT SYSTEMS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEXT PLEASE THEN IF WE LOOK AT THE FACT THAT UNLIKE LIKE ALL SPEAK THE ORANGE COUNTY METRO WHERE I WORKED MAJORITY THE WRITERS ARE LOW INCOME TRANSIT PENANCE GOD BLESS WHAT'S GOING TO WORK OR THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL MANY OF THEM MOST ON PERHAPS OUR TRANSIT ATTENDANCE THEY DON'T HAVE CARS MAJORITY ELECTRONIC WRITERS HOWEVER DO HAVE CARS EIGHTY MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM HAVE AN AUTOMOBILE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THEY ARE DISCRETIONARY WRITERS THEY CAN TAKE THE FREEWAY IF THEY WANT TO BUT THEY PREFER TO TAKE METROLINK WHICH IS A BLESSING TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE FREEWAY -- NEXT PLEASE SO WHAT IS THE MAP AGAIN AGAIN SO WHAT HAPPENS YET THIS IS MICHAEL MICHAEL REPRESENTS A VERY LOW COST OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY FREEWAYS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE A FIXED COMPASSIONATE FREEWAY SYSTEM WITH INCREASING DEMAND AND FUTURE NEXT ELECTIONS AT SIX OH THIS IS JUST A FEW THINGS HERE THIS IS ANNABELLE WE ALREADY DISCUSSED AT THE FARE INCREASE OUR THE FAIR CUT THEM TO WRITE A SHORT CLOSE NEXT NEXT IN HERE WE'RE GONNA SEE WE HOPE TO SEE THE SAME THING ON A SAM READING ONLINE LINE NEXT NEXT DOES JUST STATION ONCE BY THE WAY YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A LOT OF BUSY STATIONS FOR A CAST LA IS GOING RIGHT NOW -- THAT'S A THIS IS A VERY HEALTHY SIR WAS THAT NEXT NEXT OKAY I'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED EVERYONE'S NEXT NEXT NEXT NEXT OKAY OKAY THAT'S IT ALL WRAPPED UP WITH AND I'LL BE PLEASED TO ANSWER LATER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU THE NUMBER WELCOME MISTY FOX THE SENIOR REGIONAL PLANNER OSCAR GOOD MORNING MR CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF REYES AND SENATOR LATELY THEY'VE RIGHT RIGHT I HAVE A POWER POINT THANK YOU USE US I'M HERE TODAY TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF OUR LOS ANGELES IN THE SALMON AND YOU KNOW IN OUR COUNTY TRANS AND REAL CONNECTIVITY STUDY THAT WE JUST COMPLETED WE CALL IT THE INTER COUNTY STUDY FOR SHORT OR EXPRESSLY THIS IS A STUDY AREA WERE RIGHT IN THE HEART OF IT OF IT -- INCLUDES THESE SEVEN CITIES YOU SEE THREE SHADED CORRIDORS THOSE ARE THE CORRIDORS WE CONCENTRATE ON THE TOP ONES AND SOME NATURAL EXAMINED IN ONLINE LINE WHAT THE FUTURE GOLD LINES ON CLEAR THE MIDDLE MIDDLE IS DECEMBER DINO FREEWAY AND THE LOWER ONES METROLINK RIVERSIDE LINE NEXT SO AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENTS -- IN THE WORKS IN THIS CORRIDOR THE GOLD MINE ONTARIO AIRPORT OR -- THE METROLINK SOMEBODY IN A LINE AS MR LEAHY SAID IS MOSTLY SINGLE TRACK TRACK THERE'S A LOT OF DOUBLE TRACK PROJECTS BEING PLANNED SOME OF WHICH ARE GOING FORWARD WITH THE SCORE PROGRAM ROOM -- THAT'S JUST BEEN AWARDED -- EXPRESS LANES WOULD BECOME -- EXTENDED FROM -- BELMONT EL MONTE ALL WAY TO READ WOMEN'S EVENTUALLY SO THAT OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY FOR NEW ANY FASTER EXPRESS BUS SERVICES RUSSELL LOOKING AT BUS RAPID TRANSIT SERVICES IN THE STUDY AREA INCLUDING CONNECTING TO THE -- I'M CHAIR OR AIRPORT WORK AND SO WE STARTED A STUDY -- AT THE REQUEST OF LA METRO AND SPECTRE NEXT PLEASE SO AND -- METRO WANT TO LOOK AT -- THE EFFECTIVENESS AND WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE GOLD LINE RUNNING ALONGSIDE THE METROLINK ASSEMBLY DINO LINE THEY'LL RUN RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER FROM THE POMONA NOR STATIONS TO MONTCLAIR WON THE GOLD MINE IS BUILT AND SB CGA WANTS TO LOOK AT -- THE BENEFIT AND VALUE REAL TRENDS INVESTMENTS AND SOMEONE YOU KNOW COUNTY AND CONNECTING TO THE AIRPORT WORK AS A DOCTOR WOLFE HAD MENTIONED NEXT PLEASE LEAVE SO OUR OVERALL GOAL WAS DETERMINED THE OPTIMUM MIX AND SERVICE LEVELS OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT MODES HYBRID RAIL BEING THE DMU THE DOCTOR BOTH MENTIONED -- LIKE THE FUTURE REDLANDS RAILING SPRING SAN DIEGO COUNTY COUNTY SO THERE ARE GONNA BE COMING TOGETHER IN THE IN THIS AREA NEXT PLEASE SIR I WE HAD WE REMAIN OBJECTIVE IS A SYSTEM MARKET FOR INTRA AND INTER COUNTY TRANSIT RAIL TRAVEL IN THE CORRIDOR INCLUDING -- ORIGINS AND DESTINATIONS TO THE AIRPORT FOR TRAVEL ECONOMIC BENEFITS LOOKING AT CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS WITH THE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES AND THEN RECOMMENDING THE PATH FORWARD NEXT PLEASE THE NATURE OF THE STUDY A HIGH LEVEL OF PLANNING STUDY OUR AIM WAS NOT TO RECOMMEND A PARTICULAR PARTICULAR ALTERNATIVES OR PARTICULAR MODE NOT APPROPRIATE TO DO SO AT THIS LEVEL BUT WE DID GET A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT OF THE STUDY WE DID RIDERSHIP FORECASTING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR THE FUTURE AFTER TWENTY FORTY -- CAPITAL COSTS HAD A LOT OF PUBLIC OUTREACH AREA -- WE HAD REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SEVEN CITIES FROM CAL TRANS -- TO DISTRICT SIX SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT -- WE ALSO HAD A REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE OPERATORS METROLINK OMNITRANS FOOTHILL TRANSIT OF COURSE AS PC TA AND LA METRO AND WE HAD TWO ROUNDS OF OPEN HOUSES -- DURING TWO SUMMERS AND A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS NEXT PLEASE SO WE DID A TRAVEL MARKET ANALYSIS OF FIRST BEFORE WE STARTED WORKING ON THE ALTERNATIVES AND WE FOUND THAT MILLION TRIPS ENTER OR LEAVE THE STUDY AREA WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE'S ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION TRIPS WITHIN THE STUDY AREA SO THAT'S A LOT AND THEN YOU NOTICE INVESTMENTS IN THE PLANNING WAS A LOT OF USE WAS SERVICES BUT WE FOUND THAT THERE'S A VERY WHAT WE CALL POLICY CENTRIC CREEK TRAVEL PATTERN AS IN THIS AREA OF PEOPLE ARE GOING ON DIAGONALLY NORTH SOUTHEAST WEST AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE NORTH SOUTH SOUTH OF US SERVICES IN THE STUDY AREA THE FREQUENCY OF THEM WAS MUCH LESS THAN THE EAST WEST SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WERE THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT RIGHT IN THE HEART OF OUR TOP CITY FARES -- WE HAVE RANCHO CUCAMONGA TO ONTARIO ONTARIO AT UPLAND IN UPLAND SURROUND TRADE WITH THE TOP THREE CITY PAIRS OF THOSE SEVEN CITIES IN OUR STUDY AREA AREA NEXT PLEASE PLEASE SO DID TO PHASE IN SCREENING ONE WAS VERY HIGH LEVEL THIRTY EIGHT ALTERNATIVES BASED ON PREVIOUS STUDY AS THE TRAVEL MARKET ANALYSIS WE DID -- THERE'S SOME OF THE CRITERIA THAT WE USE TRAVEL TIME TRANSFER TIME NUMBER OF TRANSFERS MILES OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE MOSTLY FOR RAIL AND THEN WE CAME UP BASED ON THAT WITH THE FOR BUILD ALTERNATIVES OF WEEKLY PACKAGE MORTALLY -- AND WE ALSO HAVE A NO BUILD ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS NORMAL A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS NORMAL IN THE FOR BUILD ALTERNATIVES AND AGAIN WE DID -- MORE ROBERT MUCH MORE ROBUST ANALYSIS FOR THE PHASE TWO NEXT PLEASE SO HERE WE ARE PACKING IDEA ALTERNATIVE DISPLAY LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT ALTERNATIVE COMMUTER RAIL HYBRID RAIL AND BUS RAPID TRANSIT INCLUDING EXPRESS BUS NEXT PLEASE SO FOLLOWING ARE SOME MAPS OF THE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES ANOTHER PRETTY BUSY THE NO BUILDING CLUES OF THE GOLD LINES MONTCLAIR'S SINCE IT'S FUND AND -- THE RED ONE IS RAIL WAY OVER ON THE EAST YOU THINK LINE THE WEST VALLEY CONNECTOR THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY ON COUNTY SECOND I CAN BE ARE TO SERVICESINS WHICH RUNS MOSTLY ALONG THE CURRENT ON A TREND LINE SIXTY ONE ONE -- FROM DOWNTOWN ONTARIO IN IN THE PHASE ONE OF IT OF IT GOING UP TO ONTARIO MILLS MALL NEXT PLEASE AND THEN OTS AN ALTERNATIVE GSM ASSEMBLY IT TAKE THE EXISTING NETWORK OF OF BUS AND RAIL TRANSIT AND YOU AUGMENT THE FREQUENCIES AND WITH THE METROLINK DID DOESN'T LOSE SOME NEW DOUBLE TRACKING PROJECTS TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT SERVICE NEXT PLEASE A LIGHT RAIL ALTERNATIVE OPTION -- WE KNOW WE LOOKED AT IT NOW -- AND ARE TRUE ALIGNMENT AND TO GET DOWN TO THE AIRPORT AS WELL AS -- AND OUR OUR AND ALIGN ALONG CUCAMONGA CREEK AND AGAIN THEIR CONCEPTUAL THEY'RE NOT CHOSEN ALIGNMENTS NECESSARILY TO MOVE FORWARD WHAT WE USE THEM TO DO THE RIGHT OR CERTAIN HOUSES AND THE COSTS AND SO FORTH AND AND ON THE SAN BERNADINO ALIGN RIGHT AWAY AND THEN USES CUCAMONGA CREEK TO GET DOWN TO THE AIRPORT SO WE HAVE TWO PHASES OF COMMUTER RAIL -- PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO THE PHASE ONE AND WANT TO LOSE THE NEW RAIL ALIGNMENTS REAL CAPITAL PROJECT TO GET DOWN FROM RANCHO CUCAMONGA TO THE AIRPORT FOR AND IT ALSO INCLUDES EXPRESS SERVICE ON THE SAN MARINO LINE PHASE TWO INCLUDES MORE DOUBLE TRACKING PROJECTS SO AND HAS HIGHER LEVELS OF MUCH LINK SERVICE AND HAS A HYBRID REAL SERVICE RUNNING LONG DECEMBER AND YOU KNOW LINES DOCTORAL OF MENTIONED AND THEN AN EXPRESS SERVICE FROM DOWNTOWN A LATELY TO THE AIRPORT -- ON WITH THE MITCHELL EXAMINED YOU KNOW SERVICE NEXT PLEASE AND THEN WE HAVE A HYBRID REAL ALTERNATIVE THAT EXTENDS THE REDLANDS RAIL -- WEST WEST FROM DOWNTOWN SAN MARINO -- TO THE AIRPORT OR TO DOWNTOWN ON CHERRY ON AND ALL THE WAY TO THE CITY OF INDUSTRY NEXT PLEASE AND THE FINAL ANSWER UNDER THE -- THE ARE TO EXPRESS BUS IT INCLUDES A DEDICATED BUS SERVICE FROM MONTCLAIR TO THE AIRPORT OR -- FROM THE GOAL LINE STATION A NEW B. R. T. SERVICE -- RIGHT HERE ON HAVEN AVENUE BETWEEN SHAPE THE COLLEGE AND THE CITY OF CHINO AND THAT'S ABOUT IT ON THE ALTERNATIVES SO WE HAD OUR FOUR MAIN GOALS UP THERE THAT WE USE TO RATE RIGHT TO WE ALSO THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS NEXT LINE LINE AND THEN THIS IS A BAR CHART SHOWS MORE OR LESS -- HOW ALL OF THE ALTERNATIVES DID -- TO THOSE GOALS AND TO THE BLUE IS JUST AS ALL ALL ALL ALL OF THE BEIJING WANTS EQUAL LEVEL TOGETHER SO -- -- YOUR AIR SOME HIGH LEVEL RIDERSHIP INFORMATION AND COSTING INFORMATION FOR COSTS ON JUST ARRANGE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE STUDY THIRTY AND NEXT SLIDE SLIDE AND SO ARE OUR GENERAL CONCLUSION -- AND RECOMMENDED PATH FORWARD IS THAT ALL OF THE ALTERNATIVES DEGREES WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE BRG SERVICE IN THE AREA WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE EXPRESS BUS IN THE AREA MORE METROLINK SERVICE IN THE AREA AND ADDITIONAL RAIL SERVICE IN THE AREA AND SO ARE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE JUST LAST WEEK FINALIZE A STUDY AND WE'RE OFFICIALLY HANDING IT OVER TO LA METRO IN SPECTRE I CAN CLOSE MY STUDY I CAN TAKE ANY QUESTIONS LATER THANKS I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I GET TO BE THE FIRST TO SAY GOOD AFTERNOON HERE TODAY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HOLDEN FOR OCTOBER HOLDING AT THIS OLD HITTING THIS HEARING HERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHICH IN MY OPINION IS THE EMERGING ECONOMIC CENTER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PRIMARILY DUE TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE -- INCREDIBLE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE ON CENTER LEYVA ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT THAT YOU'VE SHOWN ON TO THE ENTIRE REGION WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION ISSUES NOW YOU KNOW I I WEAR A LOT OF DIFFERENT HATS HOUSE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY WAS I INVITED TO THIS I WASN'T SURE WHO WAS REPRESENTING AND I FIGURED IT OUT OUSTER CHAIR I FIGURED OUT BECAUSE AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM C. E. O.'S -- SP CTA METROLINK THE GOAL LINE AND SEND GAG AND I ACTUALLY SERVE IN THE GOVERNOR BUSH OF ALL OF THEM SO I'M HERE TO BE BE SET IS BASICALLY ONE THE ONLY ELECTED OFFICIAL THAT THIS CAN BE ADDRESSING YOU TODAY I AM I AM I WANT TO JUST PUT MY CCAC OUT ON FOR JUST A MOMENT AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT ACTIVITY IS AND ACTUALLY SEE GAG IS THE CENTER FOR FACILITATION COLLABORATION AND CONNECTIVE ITTY FOR ALL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE OF MY OVER RIDING RIDING HIS PRISONER'S GAG THIS YEAR IS THAT WE ARE THE ONLY PLACE FOR ALL HUNDRED NINETY ONE CITY SIX COUNTY AND ALL THE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES AND COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS COME TOGETHER EITHER SO IT'S REALLY UP TO US TO FILL THE GAPS TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN ACTIVITY EXISTS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE INVESTMENT WE HAVE IN ALL OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE NOW YOU'LL NOTICE ON I HAVE NO POWER POINT SO I NEED ALL OF YOU TO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND VISUALIZE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I I DON'T DO THAT KIND OF STUFF I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE AIRPORT PRIMARILY BEFORE YOU START I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT A BRING IN LOCAL CONTROL TO OUR AIRPORT AS WELL THIS IS SUPPORT OF ALSO THE CALIFORNIA AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT ALL YOUR SUPPORT HAS BROUGHT SUCCESS YEAH THE MEDIAN SIX ASSET TO OUR AIRPORT CERTAINLY ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT LOCAL CONTROL WOULD HELP IN THE GROWTH OF THE AIRPORT NEAR BRIDGE BACK AND IT TO HAPPEN THIS QUICKLY BUT IT IS EVERYONE AND EMBRACE IT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO OUR NEW -- PORT A STRONG INVITE SHOULD THERE BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU A TOWARD WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS A VIBRANT ENERGETIC AIRPORT PEOPLE -- THERE WE HAVE NO FLIGHT AIRLINE SIGN -- OF COURSE WE HAVE DAILY NONSTOPS TO TAIWAN REALLY FIRST YOUR PORTENT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUTSIDE OF LA ACTS TO PROVIDE THAT JET BLUE IS BACK AT DEALEY NONSTOP SINCE JFK FRONTIER IS RUNNING MANY -- CORRECT NONSTOP STEELY JUST STARTING TO ORLANDO AND AND MANY MORE TO COME ON THE CARGO SIDE YOU PS IS EXPANDING THAT AXES ANNOUNCED THE ONE WHO'S GOT WHICH A HUB AIRPORT AND OF COURSE THAT THE THE GROWTH AND CARGO JUST ENCOURAGES MORE BUSINESSES TO LOCATE IN THE AREA LOGISTICS AND WAREHOUSING AND CREATE FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS FOR THE REGION WHICH REALLY INITIATES EVEN MORE THE COMMITTEE FOR HOUSE AGAIN AND WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A BUILDING FIFTY THOUSAND HOUSES SELF ON TERIA INNER THAT WE ANNEXED TO THIS A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT GOING ON HERE IN THE AREA WE'VE SEEN WRITER AND ON SHIP SHIP INCREASING AT OUR AIRPORT FROM ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION WHICH IS WHERE IT WAS WHEN WE TOOK CONTROL REPTILES FIVE MILLION PASSENGERS A YEAR NOW GROWTH EVERY MONTH SINCE WE TOOK OVER THE AIRPORT AND -- IN THE TWENTY ONE TO THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE EVERY MONTH IN CARGO SO WE'RE REALLY REALLY EXCEEDING ANY EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE ONTARIO'S NOW KNOWN AS THE FASTEST GROWING AIRPORT IN THE COUNTRY WE'RE TAKING WE'RE TAKING NOTICE BY EVERYBODY AND AGAIN I COULD JUST FALL BACK TO YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL AS A SUPPORT FROM EVERYONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE IN GETTING AIRPORT AND SECONDLY IN USING OUR AIRPORT IT'S REAL IMPORTANT NOW THAT RE TRAIN PEOPLE IN THE WRITER SHOULD HAVE IT FOR SO LONG ONTARIO EITHER DIDN'T HAVE THE FLIGHTS AVAILABLE OR THEY WERE TOO EXPENSIVE AND THAT WAS REALLY OUR PRIMARY FACTOR THAT WE WANTED TO ESTABLISH AND WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BOTH WITH THE INCREASED AMOUNT OF IRAQ NONSTOP FLIGHT AND WE'VE LOWERED THE FEARS ALMOST ALL THE DESTINATIONS THAT WE FLY TO SO I THINK IT IS MUCH MORE ACCOMMODATING FOR ALL THE FOLKS REGION -- THEY DON'T NEED TO MAKE THAT DRIVE TO LOS ANGELES I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITIES RUN ELLIE ACTION THEY'RE EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT I TRAILS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT RELIEVING A LOT OF THE REJECTION AN IMPACT TO CITIES LIKE MICHAEL WOULDN'T ALSO GONE DOWN -- ON THIS GAG STANDPOINT I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT THAT I'VE ESTABLISHED IN NEW COMMITTEE AT SKAGGS JONES WAS EPICALLY WITH AVIATION WERE REESTABLISHING WILL WORK ON THE AVIATION TASK FORCE MADE UP REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL THE AIRPORTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT WE EVEN REACHING ACROSS THE BOARD AND HE WANTED IF WE CONSIDER THEM PART OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AVIATION ON NETWORK IN AND REALLY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS REALLY TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT AGAIN OKAY NEGATIVITY BUT CAN ACTIVITY BETWEEN AIRPORT CREATING A SYSTEM OR NETWORK EVER PORTAL SAID IT IS THIS KIND OF FEELING OF COMPETITIVENESS BETWEEN THE AIRPORT BECAUSE ALL THE FOR CASH SHOW THAT AT SOME POINT EVEN IF EVERY SINGLE YOUR POOR BILLS TO CAPACITY WE STILL WON'T BE ABLE TO MEET THE AVIATION INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO BE COMPETING BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO MEET HER IN A STRANGE WAY AS IT IS NOW ALMOST EVERY YEAR IMPORTANT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS HAD ITS CONSTRAINTS ONTARIO IS DOING REALLY WELL WITH PORN FROM OUR CATCHMENT AREA BUT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO SERVE AS A RELIEVER AIRPORT FOR AREN'T OFFER ORANGE COUNTY FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY INTO ONTARIO SO CAN ACTIVITY IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY WHO HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GROWTH OF THE AIRPORT IS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF THE AIRPORT UP TO ABOUT THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE MILLION PASSENGERS A YEAR BUT ONLY IF WE'RE ABLE TO GET ON THERE WITHOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN LOS ANGELES YOUR PORTENT COMMITTEE REPORT OUR COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY IS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW THE AIRPORT AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE NOT DRIVING THEIR OWN CARS INTO OUR AIRPORT THEY NEED TO REACH HERE ORDINAL TURNED ABOUT EITHER BY TRANSIT BY TRAINING BY WHATEVER BY RICKSHAW I DON'T HEAR WE WILL TAKE EVERYBODY ANYWAY THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY YOU SUPPORT THE GOAL LINE SUPPORT I SUPPORT EVERYBODY ANYTHING THAT WILL BRING PEOPLE TO OUR AIRPORT WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT WORK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN OUR PLAN TO CREATE A MULTI MODAL TRANSPORTATION CENTER THAT WILL BE A PLACE THAT COMMUTER RAIL WILL COME IN AND AMTRAK COME IN LIGHT REAL FROM BOTH DIRECTIONS EAST AND WEST AS WELL AS TRANSIT VEHICLES WE USE THAT FACILITY AS WELL SO THAT IS OUR FUTURE PLAN PLAN PROBABLY WHEN WE -- BILL TERMINAL THREE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TWO AND JUSTIN TERMINALS WHAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE IS WHAT YOU SEE IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD IS WERE THE TRANSPORTATION CENTER IS ACTION PART OF THE TERMINAL SO AS SOON AS YOU GET OUT OF OUR TRAINER YOUR BUS OR WHATEVER YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE TERMINAL AND YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND AND PURSUE YOUR YOUR AVIATION -- WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF BUILDING A NEW CUSTOMS FACILITY -- IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE FLIGHTS THAT CHINA MEXICO AND THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL CARRIERS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN BEGINNING SERVICE OR ONTARIO KIND OF WAITING FOR US TO GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE THE GROSS FOR THE CUSTOMER DISABILITY IS UNDER PLAN REVIEW RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT AS AN EXTENSION OF TERMINAL TO GOING ON THE EAST SIDE OF TERMINAL TO TO HELP ACCOMMODATE SOME THE WIDE BODY PLANES WILL BRING IN AND FROM OVERSEAS WE HAVE A DOUBT THAT ARE ARE ARE ON ON CUSTOMERS SO THAT WE HAVE NOW WE HAVE ALL THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE GLOBAL INJURY AT THE KIOSK AND EFFECTIVE HAPPY TO SAY THAT WHEN I TOOK THE INAUGURAL FLIGHT POINT BY ONE BACK TO ONTARIO I CLEAR CUSTOMS AND FIVE MATCH YOU TRY DOING THAT A DAILY I I'M TELLING YOU THE MOST I'VE EVER SEEN IS LIKE FIFTEEN MINUTES IN ONTARIO SO IT WORKS OUT WORK IS WE'RE ONLY DOING LIKE ONE PLANE AT TIMES HAD LIKE FIFTEEN PLANES SO OUR CHALLENGE IS ALWAYS GOOD AND TO MAINTAIN THE CONVENIENCE THAT WE'VE ENJOYED WITH THREE OR FOUR MILLION ANNUAL PASSENGERS WHEN WE REACH THIRTY MILLION PASSENGERS BUT THAT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING WE WANT TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE ROLE OCCURRING SO AS FAR AS CAN ACTIVITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT TRANSFORMS I AND I I PERSONALLY SEAT I TAKE NATURAL LIKE WHENEVER LOS ANGELES AND THEN WE DO NOT HAVE AN ACTIVITY THAT WE NEED BETWEEN TRANSIT AND AND METROLINK YOU SEE THAT LOS ANGELES COUNTY BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES METRO RUN BUSES BUT OF COURSE THEY HAVE BEEN A SIMPLE BUS LINES THAT ARE ABLE TO MEET THE TRAINS AND TAKE PEOPLE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT AND OUR COUNTY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON HERE AND GERMAN AND YOU KNOW COUNTY ON THAT WE NOT ONLY CREATE THE LINKS BETWEEN TRANSFER ASIAN AND THE AIRPORT OR TRAIN TRANSPORTATION THE VERSION COMMUNITIES THAT WERE SERVING SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CAN ACTIVITY TRANSPORTATION IT'S PROBABLY THE FOREMOST IMPORTANT TO THE GROWTH OF THE AIRPORT AND THE SUCCESS OF THE AIRPORT -- SO I GUESS THE REPORT CARD RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE DOING GREAT AND ALL OF YOUR WORK PAID OFF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING -- WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE THE AIRPORT AGAIN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE GOT TO HANG OUT WITH GENE SIMMONS FOR THE DAY HE OWNS ROCK GROUP GREAT RESTAURANT IS THE ALL TIME LINE NORTH TO SUPPLY A RESTAURANT SERVICES HAVE INVESTED OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS SO THERE'S ON A RESTAURANT WITH KING PARK IS THERE -- AND AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO OPEN SO WHEN YOU GET OFF AN AIRPLANE THERE'S ACTUALLY A RESTAURANT TO EAT AT IN FACT -- AGREEMENT WITH THEM IS THAT THEY MUST REMAIN OPEN FROM AN HOUR BEFORE THE FIRST LIGHT LIGHT INTO AN HOUR AFTER THE LAST FLIGHT AND THEY CAN'T CHARGE MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OVER STREET MARKET ON THEIR FOOD SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY TEN DOLLARS FOR FIVE DOLLAR HAMBURGER DOESN'T SOUND REAL EXCITING BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF YOUR CUSTOMERS YOU HOW CAN I MAKE IT A VERY COMFORTABLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE STRIVE TO DO YOU -- TO REALLY THAT'S IT YOU KNOW YEAH I THINK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR TALKING ABOUT CAN ACTIVITY TALKING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION AND TALKED ABOUT AIRPORT OFFICIALS SPECIAL BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE TIME TERRY AIRPORT WHICH OBVIOUSLY BENEFITS THE ENTIRE ARE YOU CHANGE BANKING THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WE -- HAVING SERVED ON AN AIRPORT AUTHORITY FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS -- I I KNOW WHICH WE DEALING WITH AND YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING GREAT WORK WERE -- INTEGRATING NOT ONLY THE MODEL MODEL -- CONCEPTS BUT ALSO GROWING IT AS A BUSINESS SO GRADUATION SO IN THAT REGARD FOR THAT'S OKAY PRONOUNCING YOUR YOUR NAME CORRECTLY EARLIER BUT -- BUT WELCOME OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CENTER LEYVA ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES -- -- I WANNA BE SERVICE OR BRIDGE BETWEEN THE FIND PRESENTATIONS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON -- IN THE FUTURE CHANNEL WHICH IS GOING TO BE ABOUT -- HOW WE FUND JUST TO -- BRING US BACK INTO THE THE CONCEPT OF THE INLAND EMPIRE REGION AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN I WAS BORN IN FIFTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS LESS THAN A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND TODAY THERE'S FOUR POINT SIX AND STUDIES TELL US THAT -- WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO A SIX SIX OR SEVEN POINT FIVE -- BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO THAT'S AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF GROWTH AND SO THIS DISCUSSIONS -- WE THANK YOU FOR -- BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT GROWING UP AND UP AND WE WERE ON THE NINETY ONE FREEWAY AND WE WENT PAST TYLER STREET -- WE GOT MY BROTHER AND I GOT REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY FOR REASONS TO GO PAST TYLER STREET ON A NINETY ONE GOING WEST AND THAT WAS THE ANGEL GAME THE BEACH DISNEYLAND OR NOT SO VERY FAR SO IN MY LIFETIME I'VE SEEN THIS RATE REGION TRANSFORM AND NO MORE I THINK IN THE HISTORY OF THIS REGION DO WE ALL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEFINE THE FUTURE FOR THE REGION -- YESTERDAY OUT THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS LED THE COUNTRY IN JOB GROWTH TWENTY TWO PERCENT JOB GROWTH OKAY GROWTH WE OUTPACED ORLANDO WE OUTPACED -- GREATER HOUSTON AND THAT'S A GREAT STORY TO BE TOLD SO YOU ADD THAT TO THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE THE FASTEST GROWING AREA IN THE REGION AND IN THIS ISSUE OF TRANSIT AND TRANSPORTATION EMPIRE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP -- REPRESENTS THE LARGER EMPLOYERS OF OUR REGION -- THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYER CURRENTLY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IS AMAZON WITH OVER TWENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES -- OBVIOUSLY THE SEARCH FOR THE SECOND AMAZON HEADQUARTERS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY -- I WOULD HOWEVER POINT OUT THAT INVESTMENT BY AMAZON -- TO DATE -- AMAZON HAS INVESTED ALMOST SIX SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND FIVE YEARS AGO THEY WEREN'T YOU OKAY EMPLOYER IS LOMA LINDA HEALTH AT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND ITS EMPLOYEES SO OUR PERSPECTIVE IS ONE OF THE GREAT -- CORPORATE INVESTMENTS AND -- SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES THROUGH JOBS -- I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT SYSTEMS BOTH NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE -- WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT THIS REGION IS GOING TO DO FOR -- NOT ONLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT FOR THE NATION AMAZON AND ALSO YOU PS -- WHY THEY ASSURE THAT WE WILL ALL GET OUR PACKAGES AT CHRISTMAS TIME -- ARE NOW IN THE PLANNING STAGES TO SERVE CHINA INDIA AND PARTS OF AFRICA THAT ARE GOING TO COME ONLINE WHICH MEANS IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN THOSE PLACES IN THE UNITED AND AND THE WORLD -- YOU'RE GOING TO SEE PEOPLE PURCHASING GOODS VIA FOR FILM AND A LOT OF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN BRINGS INTO -- INTO FOCUS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ONTARIO AIRPORT -- AS A LOGISTICS HOUSE LARGEST FACILITY -- IN THE UNITED STATES AND SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW IN IT WERE FULL OF OPPORTUNITY I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT -- WITH WITH THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD RELOCATING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN -- AS A REGION TAKE A LOOK AT OPPORTUNITY AND JOBS GROWTH THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT AFFECT THIS REGION AND -- COME TOGETHER AND COME TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF OF THE FUTURE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS REGION AND I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR US BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A IN LIGHT MY LEADERSHIP AND AND AND AND AND I KNOW THAT -- USE OF MEMBERS OF THE PANEL TO YOU UNDERSTAND GOES -- CHALLENGES BUT AGAIN GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE REGION AND FINALLY I DON'T HAVE A MILLENNIAL CHILD I HAVE A SIX YEAR OLD OKAY MONICA YEAH YEAH I'M FIFTY I TOOK MY FIRST AIRPLANE FLIGHT FROM THE ONTARIO AIRPORT WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN CLIMBING UP THE STAIRS OUTSIDE RIGHT TO GET ON A PLANE MEMBER THOSE DAYS RIGHT AIRPORT IS THE WAY WE GET TO NOTRE DAME GAMES RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT -- NUMBER FIVE IN THE NATION ON OUR WAY TO SHE FOR TWO DATES IN CYCLIC VIA RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE SINCE OUR GLORIA SHE KNOWS TO TAKE THAT WE TAKE THE METRO LINK -- TO GET ON THE SUBWAY TO GO TO THE LA TIMES BOOK FAIR OKAY THAT IS HER WORLD SHE EVEN HAS A SPECIAL SEAT THAT WE CARRY WITH US SO THAT WE CAN USE MOVES WERE WITH HER OKAY THAT IS FOR WORLD TO NEED A DRIVER'S LICENSE IN THE FUTURE I HOPE THAT THERE'S A COMMUNIST CARS ARE GOING TO KEEP HER SAFE AS AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE SO IN THIS DISCUSSION AS YOU HEAR ALL THE GOOD THAT'S BEEN DONE RIGHT I I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE BECAUSE NOW IS THE TIME FOR THIS REGION TO DEFINE ITSELF IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DEFINED BY JUST HUGE AMOUNTS OF GROWTH AND WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO CATCH UP BUT THIS TIME WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK TO BE MUCH MORE DELIBERATE -- CUTTING EDGE AND ENSURE THAT THAT NOT ONLY THAT THERE IS A STRONG VIBRANT ECONOMY IN THIS REGION -- BUT A GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOU'RE A GREAT -- LEADER INVOICE FOR THE PROGRESS NOT ONLY IN SAN BENITO COUNTY BUT ALSO THE FUTURE SO WE APPRECIATE THAT ALONG WITH -- MICHAEL'S YOUR LEADERSHIP HERE AND -- RANCHO THERE ANY QUICK QUESTIONS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE THIS PANEL AND THEN I'M YES COLORS SINCE WHEN IT WAS LAST WE TURN ON MY MIND AND YOU'VE KNOWN THE LONGEST TIME SO YES I HAVE SINCE YOU WERE AN ALTAR BOY I WAS I WAS A GOOD ALTER ONE OF THE AREAS AND YOU'VE BROUGHT THIS UP SO WE TALKED ABOUT JOB GROWTH I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT WITH AMAZON BEING THE LARGEST LAWYERS I'M SO GLAD THAT THEY HAVE INCREASED THEIR MINIMUM WAGE TO FIFTEEN THE ONE AREA AND YOU AND I HAVE LONG KNOWN EACH OTHER LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW EACH OTHER'S POSITIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO AIR QUALITY WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE FUTURE IN LOGISTICS SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE GOOD PAYING JOBS IF WE ARE TO BE THE LOGISTICS HUB HUB TO BRING GOOD PAYING JOBS NOT PART TIME OR OR JOB AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ALSO TECH TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE TO FIND THE BALANCE BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MANY TOO MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT TOO MANY CHILDREN ONE ONE AND TEN ONE AND SEVEN THE PENDING ON WHAT'S WHAT TO SIX WE LOOK AT IT NEITHER ONE IS GOING TO GO AWAY WE NEED THE PEOPLE HERE WE NEED FOR THEM TO THE HEALTHY KNOWN AS THE HUB BUT WITH HALF A MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OF LOGISTICS SIX -- WE'VE GOT THE DIESEL TRUCKS COMING IN SO IT'S NOT THAT THAT FIT LOGISTICS AND SELLS SELLS ITS ITS THE DIESEL TRUCKS COMING IN AND WHAT IT DOES TO THE COMMUNITY WHERE DO YOU FIND THAT BALANCE HOW WHAT WHERE DO WE NEED TO GO TO FIND THAT BALANCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT'S A GREAT QUESTION YOU KNOW MY PERSPECTIVE IS A YOU'RE ALL MY FAMILY HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THIS REGION AND SO MY GRAND GRANDFATHER WORKED IN ORANGE ORANGE GROVES RIGHT OKAY AND UNFORTUNATELY WHILE WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN ONE JOB GROWTH THE LAST FIVE YEARS -- WE'RE STILL OF METRO REGIONS OVER MILLION THE ONE THAT HAS THE LOWEST BACK WORRIED AT TWENTY ONE PERCENT AND SO JOBS THAT DON'T HAVE A HIGH THRESHOLD FOR EDUCATION ARE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE JUST TO GET ALONG AND I ALSO AS YOU KNOW WE WORRY ABOUT THE GOING RATE OF POVERTY -- UNEMPLOYMENT UNDEREMPLOYMENT AND ALL OF THE SOCIAL ILLS THAT COME WITH THAT -- -- BRIDGING REACT TO WHAT I WHEN I WAS I WAS TALKING ABOUT -- WITH OPPORTUNITIES OF COURSE THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD I THINK I I I UNDERSTAND ATLANTA AT THE COCA COLA HEADQUARTERS -- AND AND WORKING WITH -- LEADERSHIP THAT UPS LAST WAS WELL LAST WEEK -- THERE'S A HUGE DESIRE TO MAKE TECHNICAL AS POSSIBLE -- SO I THINK WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE -- WE NEED TO STUDY BECAUSE IN SOME CASES THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T THERE YET -- BUT BUT THAT'S THAT'S MY HOPE IS FOR REALLY COME TOGETHER NOT JUST RUN TO YOUR CORNERS AND YELL AT EACH OTHER -- BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING FOR EITHER SIDE WE REALLY NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND FIND WAYS TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS ORDER SO THOSE TECHNOLOGIES WHERE THEIR TRUCKS -- WHETHER THEY'RE WITHIN THE WAREHOUSE HOUSE AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT ACCORDING TO A STUDY OUT OF UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR JOB AND IT'S NOT JUST THE WAREHOUSE HOUSE IT'S THE OPHTHALMOLOGIST IT'S THE CPA'S SIXTY PERCENT OF THE JOBS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO AUTOMATION AGE -- AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER PRESSURE THAT WE FEEL AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO AS WELL WELL WELL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE A. P. -- YOU ARE A LEADER AND WE DO LOOK TO YOU -- THE COMMUNITY LOOKS TO US ALSO TO BE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE DO WHATEVER DECISIONS WE MAKE THEY ARE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE WE WANT THEM TO STAY HEALTHY BECAUSE IN THE END WE WILL SPEND SO MUCH MORE IF WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF THEIR HEALTH BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR DOCTOR WILL ALSO THE DOCTOR WILL SIT ON THE QUESTION WAS OUT OF -- AND THE GENTLEMAN ONE OF THE OTHER PRESENTERS OR -- SPECIFICALLY ABOUT GOLDLINE LINE AS YOU KNOW I REPRESENTING THE DISTRICT FORTY OR DISTRICT FORTY SEVEN WHICH BEGINS AT FONTANA AND THAT I WANT TO KNOW -- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT ADDITIONAL IMPACT -- BECAUSE THEY COULD REDUCE SERVICE SERVICE TO THE VERY PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT SENT OUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WILL YOU AS SPC TA DO TO PROTECT TRANSIT A TRANSIT AS IT AVAILABILITY IN MY DISTRICT I THINK HERE CONCERN IS THE DIFFERENCE AND FAIRS IN THE TWO SYSTEMS YOU SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- A ONE WAY TRIP FOR ON THE GOLD LINE EXAMPLE WHEN IT GETS TO COME ON A NORTH IS A DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE TWO EVERYWHERE METRO SERVERS SO YOU GO TO LONG BEACH A ONE WAY TRIP ON THE METRO LIKE SYSTEM TO UNION STATION WITH THE CURRENT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TEMPORARY FAIR REDUCTION IS SIX DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS SO IT'S A FIVE DOLLAR DIFFERENCE IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOAL LINE SERVICE CHEAPER IT MEANS THAT IT'S BEING SUBSIDIZED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE HEAVILY BUT THE CONCERN AND WE HAVE AND WE'VE EXPRESSED AND IN NUMEROUS VENUES IS THAT WHEN WE'VE ALREADY SEEN WE'VE GOT THAT WE'VE GOT EVIDENCE THAT THE GOLD LINE CURRENTLY THE TERMINUS IN IS USE -- IS DRAWING PASSENGERS OFFER THE METROLINK SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THAT -- SUBSIDY DIFFERENTIAL ON THE AND THE FARE DIFFERENTIAL -- TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WHEN IN THE GOAL LINE CONVERGES INTO THE METROLINK CORRIDOR OR WHETHER IT STOPS MONNING NORTH CLEARLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO PAY A DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE SIX SEVENTY FIVE EIGHT DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU HAD FURTHER EAST ITS PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST OF US DOESN'T MATTER OUR FINANCIAL STATUS AGAIN AND MAKE THE CHOICE THE CHEAPER ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER AND LEAVES ANALYZE THE THE SERVICES THE THE TIME DIFFERENTIAL TO TAKE THE GOAL LINE THREE PASADENA DOWN INTO ELIAN STATION IS INCONSEQUENTIAL IT'S YOU KNOW THE TUNE OF OF FIVE OR SIX MINUTES DIFFERENCE IN TIME SO IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM REALLY BEEN WORKING WITH LA METRO CERTAINLY NOT A DECISION OF DECEMBER YOU KNOW COUNTY BUT A SOLUTION IS TO TAKE STEPS TO RECOGNIZE THAT -- YOU NEED DISTANCE BASED FARES ON THE THE -- THE GOAL LINE SYSTEM AND AND IN GENERAL ON THE THE METROLINK SYSTEMS A METRO SYSTEM AS IT'S EXPANDING THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT A DECISION THAT THAT WE CAN CAN INTERFERE WITH SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED DOWNEY THAT THERE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS RIDERSHIP BECAUSE OF THAT FARE DIFFERENTIAL AND WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY THROUGH OUR LOCAL SALES TAX MEASURE TO COVER THE INCREASED SUBSIDIES NEED SO THIS COULD TRANSLATE TO A REDUCED SERVICE EAST OF MONTCLAIR EAST MONO WHEREVER THEY TERMINATE THEIR FINAL SERVICE IT'S IT'S A REAL PROBLEM THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH LA NATURAL AND AND TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO WELL TO COUNT ON US TO TO TO PARTNER WITH YOU YOU I THINK THAT -- AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ME TO HAVE A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH SBC TA I EVERY TIME WE HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK ABOUT ANY OF THE ISSUES YOU'VE ALL BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE BUT THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN THAT BECAUSE OF THE SUBSIDIZING OF THE THE THE GOLD LINE LIKE THAT IT IS TAKING AWAY FROM METROLINK AND THAT IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT VERY SERIOUS IMPACT ON ON THE RIDERSHIP SHIP FROM FROM MY SPECIFIC AREA FROM THE EAST TO THE EASTERN PORTION OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP THANK YOU THANK YOU I WILL START WITH DOCTOR NOVEL CENSURED THEIR HAVE YOU RECENTLY BECOME A DOCTOR OF I JUST IT'S GROWING UP ALL THESE YEARS EVEN SCREW THAT UP I'M VERY SORRY I DID NOT KNOW SO I'M GLAD THAT I KNOW DOCTOR WILL MY QUESTION ARE THERE A LOT OF PROJECTS HAPPENING IN A LACY GABRIEL SAMBERG THE NOW -- WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST AN ACTIVITY TO LA COUNTY AND SAN MARINO COUNTY HOW HOW DO WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR FOLKS TO ART TALKED ABOUT THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE ON THE FREEWAY NETWORK AND CERTAINLY WE IN SAM'S YOU KNOW COUNTY OUR CONTINUING TO ADVANCE PROJECTS THIS THE -- LEAST ADDING LANES TO SOME OF THE KEY ARTERIALS BUT WE ARE VERY QUICKLY REACHING A POINT WHERE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO ADD CAPACITY IS CERTAINLY IN THE GREATER LA BASIN INCLUDING THE SAN MARINO VALLEY IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT WILL EVER ADD A NEW FREEWAY FACILITY -- AND SO WITH THE POPULATION GROWTH THAT THAT ARE NOT -- COMMENTED ON WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO GET PEOPLE TO MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES AND I THINK THE MOST EXCITING THING THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS IS WHAT I MENTION AT THE END OF MY PRESENTATION IS LOOKING TO BRING ZERO EMISSION PASSENGER RAIL TECHNOLOGY THAT NOT ONLY BENEFITS A SHORT RAIL ROAD THAT WE'RE BUILDING IN THE EASTERN PART OF OUR COUNTY BUT REALLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT THE ENTIRE METROLINK SYSTEM WHICH IS OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF PASSIONATE RAIL THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY AND THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO TO HAVE THAT INCUBATED HERE IN SAM'S IF YOU KNOW COUNTY YET THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL IT'S VERY EXCITING WHAT MY OTHER QUESTION IS GOING TO BE WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON TO CONTROL EMISSIONS THAT'S ONE A BIG ONE IS THERE ANY OTHER PROJECTS OR ARE THERE ANY OTHER PROJECTS THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THAT WILL CONTROL EMISSIONS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE SO WE'VE PARTNERED THE LATELY IT'S A MANUFACTURER'S BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES ON A COUPLE OF PILOT PROJECTS ONE WITH WRITER THAT CONCLUDED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT -- LOOKED AT -- PURCHASING -- BATTERY POWERED VEHICLES AND SMALLER SCALE AT THE TIME BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD ADVANCE TO THE POINT OF A VERY LARGE VEHICLES -- AND NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH THE LADY AGAIN AND -- THE SHORT HAUL FREIGHT RATE -- OF VEHICLES THAT ARE USED IN A MEMBER WHAT THEY CALL IN BUT THAT ARE USED IN THE -- INTERMODAL YARDS AND SO WE ARE YOU KNOW TRYING TO ADDRESS THE THE QUESTION IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS ON HOW DO WE CONVERT THE VEHICLES THAT ARE USE THE GRADE SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE USED -- WERE NOT TO THE POINT YET YET AND LAST YEAR EARLIER THIS YEAR A -- A BATTERY POWERED SEMI TRACTOR TRAILER BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE TO THAT POINT WHERE THOSE VEHICLES I THINK ARE GOING TO INFILTRATE THE MARKET PLACE BUT AS A AS A COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS WERE VERY ACTIVE IN TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT HELP TO ACCOMPLISH A MUCH HEALTHIER ENVIRONMENTS AND WAS YOU KNOW COUNTY EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WILLFUL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MORE JUST A COMMENT FOR A MERE WALK THERE I LOVE ALL THE CHANGES THAT WERE SITTING AT THE AIRPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THOSE OF US WHO WERE THERE TWICE A WEEK WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT HAVE ONE LITTLE FAVOR DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS CAN RE PAVE THE PARKING LOT IT REALLY TEARS AT MY HEELS SO THIS IS A TOTALLY PERSONAL BUT THANK YOU IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THE TRANSFORMATION I TO REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO PORT WALKING UP THE STAIRS OUT OUTSIDE -- AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT AMAZON AND AND YOU KNOW THERE'S TWENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES BUT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT OR THOUSAND OF THOSE JOBS ARE TEMPORARY PART TIME JOBS AND I KNEW THAT TWO YEARS AGO -- THE CITY OF SAN DINO HAD TO CUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT THEY USUALLY GIVE TO NON PROFITS SO THEY COULD RE PAVE THE STREETS BECAUSE THAT'S A LOT OF CARS COMING IN AND OUT SO WE JUST HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT AMAZON HAS INCREASED THEIR MINIMUM WAGE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT EVEN FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IS NOT A LIVING WAGE MY TO MILLENNIALS THAT I REFERRED TO ONE PAY SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IN ONTARIO AND THE OTHER ONE PIECE FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS FOR AN APARTMENT IN ONTARIO AND THEY BOTH HAVE VERY GOOD JOBS IN THE HEALTH PARTNERS THAT HAVE GOOD JOBS SO WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE JOB SO WE'LL BRING IN TWENTY TWO PERCENT GROWTH WHILE THAT'S GREAT WHAT JOBS ARE WE BRINGING AND NOW WHERE I SIT AND WHERE WE SIT WHEN WE COMPANIES HAVE TO HAVE THEIR EMPLOYEES GO ON WELFARE OR COLLECT FOOD STAMPS THAT'S LESS MONEY THAT WE AS A GOVERNMENT CAN I USE FOR EDUCATION AND OTHER THINGS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'LL BRING SUSTAINABLE JOBS LAST NIGHT WE DID A TOWN HALL WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN WHO'S RUNNING FOR ON THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND HE TALKED ABOUT STAND AND STEAM JOBS COMING TO THE INLAND EMPIRE TO SAM REGINO COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE KIND OF VISION THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE ONLY JOBS THAT COME TO THE INLAND EMPIRE ARE NOT JUST WAREHOUSE JOBS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PRIMARILY GOOD JOB MORE SUSTAINABLE FAMILY JOBS SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR HAVING THIS VERY INFORMATIVE AS WE HAVE LOTS OF GREAT WORK THAT WE GET TO DO WELL THANK YOU AND -- WE HAVE OUR FINAL PANEL THERE WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO AND WE DO APPRECIATE THOSE OF USE OF THAT ON THE PREVIOUS -- THREE BUT IF YOU CAN OF HOLD ON WE'RE GOING TO ALSO PUT THE -- REQUEST OUT THERE IF THERE'S ANY ONE OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAS A QUESTION THERE ARE BLUE CARDS THAT THE STAFF I BELIEVE AS AVAILABLE SO AS WE

SINCE THEN THE STATE HAS NOT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS DAY IF YOU GO BACK TO THE DOLLARS THAT WERE ALLOCATED ON THE PROPOSITION ONE B. AND YOU WERE TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS INVESTED IN THOSE DOLLARS AND HOW THEY WERE THE LEVER ASKING PARTICULARLY AND MOST OF THOSE DOLLARS ONE DOLLAR OF THAT OF A PROPOSITION ONE B. WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MATCHES TO THE THREE DOLLARS THE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING WHEN IT WAS FEDERAL OR LOCAL OR OTHER SOURCES FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND IF YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THAT PROJECTS THAT WE BUILT AS A STATE EIGHT IN CONJUNCTION WITH WITH LOCAL ENTITIES IN THE COUNTY YOU WILL SEE THAT MOST OF CONTRIBUTED PARTICULARLY HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY WE LOSE SOMETIMES THAT FACT AND THAT NOW THAT ABILITY FOR US TO DO THAT AT WAS PARTNERSHIPS THAT WAS PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE STATE EIGHT AND COUNTY TRANSPORTATION -- THIS IS LIKE LIKE THE ONES THAT WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVE HERE AT LIKE RAY OVER HERE FROM FROM FROM SAN BERNARDINO WE TOOK THOSE DOLLARS AND WE PUT THEM IN THE PROJECTS AND MATCH THEM AGAINST OTHER DOLLARS THE TRADE REWARD OR ENHANCEMENTS PROGRAM WAS MENTIONED IT'S PART OF THAT'S BECAUSE ONE IT IS THE SUCCESSOR TO -- PREVIOUS PROGRAM CALLED TRI CORDER IMPROVEMENT FIND TCI YEAH THOSE WILL INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED TO OUR TRADE REWARD OR THERE WAS DISCUSSION BY PAUL AND OTHERS ABOUT HOW TRADE IS OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE LOTS NOT DOLLARS THAT WAS PUT INTO THAT PROGRAM THAT ULTIMATELY IMPROVED OUR ECONOMIC BYE BYE BYE TALLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO WHICH RACK RACK BUSINESSES WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET RESIDENTS MOVED AROUND AND WE'RE NOT GONNA SIT ACTIVELY INCREASE OUR ECONOMIC BASE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT IT IF YOU DRIVE THE PORT IS WE SPEAK TODAY AND THEY'RE INVESTING IN LOTS OF MONEY IN THERE PORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THIS WORLDWIDE MARKET IT'S ESSENTIAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY THAT WE BE ABLE TO GET THOSE GOODS IN AND OUT OF THIS REGION WITH WE DON'T YOU KNOW LIKE WHY AS A STATE IMPROVE THE CORRIDORS TO COME IN AND OUT OF THOSE BILLBOARDS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO THE JOB THEY GENERATE WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THAT BATTLE AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD IN OUR NATION OUTSOURCE THESE ITEMS THAT ARE SO VITAL TO OUR ECONOMY I'M ALL SHARE SOMETHING WITH YOU WHAT WE DID AS PART OF LA COUNTY WHEN WE POUR PUTTING FORTH MEASURE AND MY MOST RECENT SALES TAX INITIATIVE I TOOK THE THIRTY ONE CITIES THAT WE HAD AND DID WHAT WE CALL THE MOBILITY STUDY AND I APPROACHED ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THEY SAID SET ASIDE YOUR CURRENT NEEDS FOR THE MOMENT TO SET ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU CURRENTLY GUIDE AND GIVE ME A LONG RANGE VISION GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF WHERE YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE AS THE SUBREGION TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW FORTY YEARS FROM NOW AND WE GOT THEM TO AGREE ON A SET OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WE TOOK THAT AND WE WENT TO EACH OF THE COMMUNITIES INSTEAD BASED ON THESE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES COLLECTIVELY FOR US FOR US EVERY WHAT TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT IN WHAT WE HAVE TO BILLS WILL MAKE SURE THAT WILL BE VITAL AS COMMUNITIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE DEVELOPED A LISTLESS SIXTEEN MILLION BILLION EXCUSE ME SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH THE NEEDS THAT WE KNEW WE HAD YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND ALL THAT OUT OF ONE STORES MEASURE AND ESSENTIALLY BEATING HEAVILY TO THAT PROGRAM GRAHAM IT PASS OUT WITH A VERY STRONG SUPPORT I THINK PRIMARILY BECAUSE MOST OF THESE NEEDS WERE GENERATED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THIS WAS A GROUND UP TYPE OF EVENT AND WHAT WE'RE PREPARED NOW THE LEVERAGE THOSE AGAINST YOU DOLLARS THE STATE MIGHT PROVIDE LET ME TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE LEVERAGING WE HAD HAD A GOAL LINE IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY HAVE THE THE THERE WAS THAT DISCUSSION OF THE ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRIBUTED BUT IT'S AGAINST THE PROJECT AT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WE ARE LEVERAGING MONEY FROM THE STATE AID WITH LOCAL DOLLARS IN ORDER TO GET THAT PROJECT FULLER COULD HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE THE FIFTY SEVEN SIXTY WAS MENTIONED ON WE HAVEN'T PROVEN TO BE SEE ON HERE COST OF THAT IS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS SP ONE IS BEING TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AGAIN THAT'S THAT DISCUSSION ON HAVING HER IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE LOCAL CONSTITUENCY AND CAL TRANS IN THIS CASE TO PUT FORWARD AN ESSENTIAL PROJECT FOR OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY BUT IT'S ALSO A LEVERAGING OF THE DOLLARS IT'S HOW WE'RE GOING FORWARD THAT SEVENTY ONE FREEWAY WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES HERE AGAIN YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT TO LOOK AT THE LEVERAGING THE DOLLARS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN SB ONE FINDS ITS BEING CONTRIBUTED HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE AND THEN I WANTED TO MENTION SOME OF OUR ALAMEDA QUARTER PROJECTS COULD ADD THE NEXT YEAR PLEASE HERE'S A LEVERAGING EVER PROJECT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD THE GRADE SEPARATION -- IN THIS CITY OF MONTEBELLO MONTEBELLO BOULEVARD IN FORTY NINE MILLION AND THAT WOULD BE COMING FROM AS IN ONE AND THEN FINALLY WE GOT ONE MORE WE HAVE ANOTHER PROJECT THAT OF TURNBULL CANYON ANOTHER GREAT SEPARATION ROUGHLY EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND A TWENTY MINUTE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION FROM SP ONE LINE I THINK IF YOU GO OUT ON AMBER MY THREE WORDS YOU GUYS WHEN YOU GO OUT AND TALK TO THE COMMUNITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED IN THE PAST WE'VE PROVEN IN AS STATE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT WE CAN DELIVER IF THE IF WE HAVE THE DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO US PROPOSITION ONE BE WAS A HUGE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S DONE ON WE DID THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN IF YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY AND F. AS SB ONCE REVISED THE NOVEMBER ELECTION SO THAT THANK YOU FOR TELLING TIME THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE TO MICHAEL MICHAEL WELCOME WELCOME I WILL MOVE THROUGH MY PRESENTATION QUICKLY -- I ALSO HAVE A MILLENNIAL -- HE HAS NEVER OWNED A CAR ANY GROUP IN LA HE LIVES IN NEW YORK NOW SUITE IS REALLY NEED ONE -- -- SO LET ME MOVE TO MIND QUICKLY I'LL JUST SKIP OVER THE PARTS FOR THAT -- PEOPLE OF ALREADY COVERED AND HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK EVERYBODY'S TALKED ABOUT SP ONE PORTENT THE IMPORTANT THING TO STRESS HERE IS THE SPLIT LIKE THAT OCCURRED WITH SP ONE BECAUSE A LOT OF LOCAL IS A COMBINATION OF LOCAL AND STATE FUNDING THAT GOES TO THAT THAT IT IS COMMITTED TO TRANSPORTATION IT'S CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ACTIVE -- AND THAT'S -- IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS IT CANNOT BE DIVERTED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE THESE ARE THE KEY THINGS THAT IT'S DOING IN LOS ANGELES HELPING US DELIVER MEASURE AM MEASURE AND RELIED ON STATE FEDERAL FUNDS BEING AVAILABLE ONE CAME ALONG EARLIER IN THE MEASURE AND PROGRAM -- TO HELP WITH THAT IT'S ALSO HELPING US TO ADDRESS THE TWENTY BY TWENTY TWENTY EAST INITIATIVE WHERE WE WANT TO HAVE TWENTY PROJECTS DONE BY THE TIME THE OLYMPICS START PART -- WE ARE -- THERE'S BEEN MANAGEMENT BECAUSE WE WOULD PROGRAM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE TALKED ABOUT PROP ONE BE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WHERE THERE IS A ONE TIME INFUSION OF FUNDS FOR THE STATE'S FIRST TIME TO HAVE AN ONGOING FUNDING COMMITMENT TO GOODS MOVEMENT PROJECTS AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF -- SP ONE WE KNOW THAT -- OBVIOUSLY PROP SIX IS A THREAT RIGHT IF LOT OF THE FUNDING MOST OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS GOES AWAY THERE SOME FUN SOURCES THAT HAVE -- SOME SOME OF SB ONE CATEGORIES THAT HAVE OTHER FUNDS SOURCES BUT -- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SIGNIFICANT THREAT RIGHT WHAT WHILE WE SAY IS THERE'S ONE OF THREE THINGS THAT HAPPEN HOUSE OF FUNDING GOES AWAY YOU EITHER CUT THEIR SCOPE OF THE PROJECT YOU DELAY THE PROJECT OR TO GIVE YOU THE LEADER PROJECT SO ONE OF THOSE THE THREE THINGS IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ALL OF THE PROJECTS THAT COULD FUND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WIDE FOR US -- IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE ARE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS WELL AS THE COUNTY INCORPORATED AREA THEY GET TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR FOR LOCAL STREET ROAD REPAIR PROJECTS THAT IS HAPPENING DIRECT THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO THE CITIES WE DON'T TOUCH IT OR LET ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT IT'S ALL OF THE CITY'S DISCRETION -- AND IF AS THE PROP SIX PASSES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE CITIES WILL HAVE FIRST LOCAL STREET ROAD REPAIR GETS CUT IN HALF AS A SIGNIFICANT THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT LOSS IS HELPING -- WITH US OF THE BIG KEY THING FOR US BECAUSE WE WANT TO HELPING TO EXPAND TRANSIT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE GOAL LINE WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT A NEW RAIL PROJECT IT GOES FROM DOWNTOWN INTO THE SOUTHEAST PART OF THE COUNTY EXTENDING THE GREEN LINE TORRANCE AND NEW RAIL LINE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY REXY BREAKING GROUND TOMORROW OR ON SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE ORANGE LINE AND -- THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AS WELL WELL THESE ARE JUST AS IT IS JUST A BREAKDOWN OF ERRORS FUNDING CATEGORIES -- THAT'S THE TRANSIT INTERCITY REAL CAPITAL PROGRAM WHICH WAS ONE OF THE BIG TARGETS FOR US -- THE NEXT NEXT A POT HOLES I MENTION CIVIC SKIP THROUGH THAT ONE HIGHWAYS WITH TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS A LOT OF SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS WE DID AN EVENT YESTERDAY WITH CAL TRANS WHERE THEY ARE LEAST RIGHT BEING A NUMBER FREEWAYS THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY RESTRICTING MIGHT SOUND BORING BUT IF YOU HAVE A CAR THAT LOOKS AT THE LANES OR IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES NEEDS TO SEE THE LATELY AND -- IF YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY IN SOME OF OUR OLDER FREEWAYS IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SEE THE LANES AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY PROJECT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS WE COULD JUST SKIP THROUGH THAT FOR THE NEXT ONES WHEN I MENTION FREIGHT RATE OF INTEREST OF TIME WILL KEEP GOING ON A CLEAN AIR IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE THE INVESTMENTS IN OUR TRANSIT SYSTEM ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE REGIONAL BENEFITS US GAG HAS THE -- SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY CATEGORY THROUGH THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND THE END OF THE REGION NEEDS ARE TRANSIT OUR TRANSIT INVESTMENTS TO ME ARE REGIONAL AIR QUALITY GOES GOALS OF THIS IS IN THE SP ONE FUNDS ARE IMPORTANT -- ELEMENTAL MAKING THAT HAPPEN HAPPEN THE EXCELLENT LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND THEN -- THIS JUST THE WEBSITE WE HAVE -- HAD A VERY EFFORT GOING ON EVERYTHING WE DO AND SAY IS THAT IT BY OUR ATTORNEYS SO -- WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO TO PEOPLE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE INVESTMENTS OF WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING AND EVERYTHING IS ON OUR WEBSITE WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU MICHAEL -- UNDER UNDER GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CHAIR HOLDEN FOR HAVING ME TODAY IN A NICE TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES I'M I'M GONNA FOCUS TODAY ON POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF PROPOSITION SIX SPECIFIC IMPACTS AND STAMINA DINO COUNTY AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BECAUSE I'M NEVER DOING AN ANIMATED SLIDE PRESENTATION AGAIN -- THE LARGEST IMPACT TIME WE'LL SEE IS -- THE IMPACT ON THE FORMULA ALLOCATIONS AND WITH THE LARGEST IMPACT BEING THOSE ALLOCATIONS TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE CITIES IN THE COUNTY FOR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS RE HAPPEN EIGHT MINUTES THIS YEAR FOR EXAMINING OUT COUNTY THAT'S ESTIMATED AT ABOUT FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS AS ALSO TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE EXPECTING TO SEE AN INCREASE OF THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS COMING THROUGH THE STABILISATION OF -- THAT STATE TRANSIT ASSISTANCE FUND WHICH HAS BEEN A HISTORICALLY VOLATILE SOURCE FOR TRANSIT AND THE STATE OF GOOD REPAIR PROGRAM WHICH IS FOCUSED ON A MAINTAINING THE EXISTING TRANSIT NETWORK AND THEN FINALLY -- THE ONE ONE FORMULA FOUND THAT SVC TA RECEIVES BECAUSE OF OUR MEASURE I TRANSPORTATION SALES TAXES THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM I'M AND ALL THAT SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS WILL GROW WITH TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE DECIDED TO END ACCESS SALES TAX -- THE GAS TAX FOR NOW AND FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO THE CITIES FOR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS AND THEY IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND ONE PROJECTS FOR IMPROVEMENT -- RECEIVED TWENTY ONE MIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF COURSE THIS IS ONLY A PARTIAL YEAR ALLOCATION BUT THAT WAS A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN THIS PERIOD FOR THE LOCAL AGENCIES IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED ELEVEN PROJECTS FOR IMPROVEMENT AND IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS ARE CITY WIDE MAINTENANCE PROJECTS SO MANY MORE ROADS WILL ACTUALLY BE IMPACTED BY -- THIS FUNDING THAN IT APPEARS I LIKE I SAID THERE'S FIFTY NINE MILLION ESTIMATED TO BE RECEIVED AND THAT'S A SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT INCREASE I AM I YOU CAN JUST GO THROUGH THESE REAL QUICKLY THESE OF COURSE ARE THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT'S ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND NEW REVENUE -- NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADE FOR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT ARE COUNTY DID REALLY WELL IN THE FIRST ROUND OF COMPETITION LEAST THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE MILLION DEPENDING ON HOW THINGS GO WITH METROLINK SCORE PROGRAM THAT THAT CAN BE UP OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN THESE COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS AND THAT IS -- THAT FAR EXCEEDS OUR SHARE OF WHAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE OUR SHARE OF STATEWIDE FUNDING SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE FIRST ROUND OF COMPETITION -- WE HAPPEN TO BE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AND THE RIGHT TIME WITH A LOT OF OUR MAJOR PROJECTS WHERE THEY FIT WELL IN THE CRITERIA OF THESE PROGRAMS AND THEY WERE READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION JUST THOSE PROJECTS ALONE WERE OVER AT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION YOU CAN DO ONE MORE TIME TWENTY NINE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY RECEIVE FUNDING AND THE SPURS COMPETITION THAT WAY THAT TOTAL FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE FORMULA ALLOCATIONS WE'VE MADE I STAFF IT HAS BEEN A CTA WENT THROUGH AN ASSIGNED AS LOW MEDIUM AND HIGH RISK TO EACH OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WERE AWARDED FUNDING AND GREEN YOU CAN SEE THE PROJECTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LOW RISK THESE PROJECTS HAVE EITHER BEEN EXPRESSED AS PRIORITIES BY THE STATE SUCH AS THE -- DMU DIZZY MOUNTAINS EMAIL CONVERSION PROJECT DOCTORAL SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER -- OR IN THE CASE OF OR A TEN EXPRESS LANES PROJECT WE'VE ALREADY AWARDED A CONTRACT A LOT OF THE MONEY COMES FROM ACTUALLY FROM A FEDERAL SOURCE OUT OF AN SP ONE PROGRAM SO WE FEEL THAT HE'S MEDIUM RISK PROJECT RISK EITHER BECAUSE THEY'RE PROGRAMMED ON THIS FISCAL YEAR THEY'VE BEEN ALLOCATED FUNDS BY THE STATE BUT THEY HAVEN'T YET YET HAD A CONTRACT AWARDED SO WE AREN'T REAL SECURE THAT THOSE -- PROJECTS THE FUNDING COULD STAY AROUND FOR THOSE PROJECTS AND THEN HIGH RISK PROJECTS ARE THOSE WITH THE BULK OF FUNDING IS PROGRAMMED AND THE OUTER YEARS SO WE KNOW THE REVENUE HASN'T BEEN COLLECTED YET YET FOR THOSE PROJECTS AND THE OTHER ONE TO GRADE SEPARATION HAS BEEN MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES TODAY WE ASSIGN THAT AS A HIGH RISK PROJECT JUST BECAUSE THE PROJECT IS PROGRAMMED OUT IN LATER YEARS AND IT'S COMING FROM PROGRAM RIGHT NOW AND LATER FOR STATE FUNDS FROM MUST BE ONE THAT COULD BE BACK BACK FILLED WITH FEDERAL THAT'S OUR SIMON OF RESTAURANTS FOR SAMITY NOW COUNTY THANK YOU FOR THAT CAN I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU REAL QUICK QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL TURN TO SOME OF MEMBER RESEARCH HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL AND THEN IF WE HAVE ANY CARDS FOR A PUBLIC PUBLIC TAKE THOSE NOW BUT -- AS IT RELATES TO THE IMPACT OF THE GAS TAX ON SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY POPULATION HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE THAT -- AND THEN THE OTHER PART OR THERE ARE THEY DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT ACTED SO THE IMPACT OF THE GAS TAX ON SAN BERNARDINO POPULATIONS AND WELL IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR -- FOR SAM READY NOW COUNTY POPULATION THE GAS TAX IS AN INTERESTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF GAS TAXES AN INTERESTING SUBJECT -- BECAUSE IT IS DISTRIBUTED BY POPULATION SOME OF OUR BECAUSE WE ARE LOCATED IN AN AREA -- WITH MAJOR FREEWAYS CROSSING THROUGH MAYBE WE'RE NOT GETTING A RETURN TO SOURCE TYPES OF ALLOCATION OUT OF THE GAS TAX BUT THIS IS YOU KNOW AS AS IT SHOWS THEY'RE EXPECTING TO RECEIVE SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT INCREASE IN THIS FISCAL YEAR SO I'D SAY IT SAID SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THE LOSS OF THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT RICHARD SOME JUST JUST TO GENERAL JONES AND I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD WANT TO RESPOND TO IT BUT -- WHERE THERE WAS A CUT MICHAEL TURNER WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CLEAN AIR TALKING ABOUT CLEAN THEIR MORE LECTURES BUSES OF YOU I KNOW YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY OF BUT BUT CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- COULD ALSO TRANSLATE TO SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY HOW HOW MUCH IMPORTANCE ARE YOU GIVING TO THE CLEAN AIR ACT -- OF SP ONE FUNDING WELL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE FORM OF WRITING REASONS -- FOR THE REGION WE ALL LIVE UNDER THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND SO EACH COUNTY GOES ABOUT IT THEIR OWN WAY -- OVERALL THE THE REGION DOES RELY ON INVESTMENTS FROM OUR TRANSIT TO MEET ITS GOALS BECAUSE THEY DO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE TO THE REDUCTION SO THAT'S JUST THE THAT'S JUST A BIG ELEMENT OF THE OVERALL REDUCTIONS BUT THE STRATEGIES FOR EACH COUNTY ON A REALLY BOTTOMS UP AND THAT'S THE WAY THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES STRATEGY WAS STRUCTURED -- FOR US IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY INVESTMENTS IN TRANSIT ARE THE MAIN WAYS WHERE WE'RE TREATING THE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN OUR REGIONS SO THE SP ONE FUNDS ARE CRITICAL TO THAT -- WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT FROM OUR LOCAL SALES TAXES BUT THOSE LOCAL SALES TAXES RELY ON STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS MEET THE FUNDING COMMITMENTS SO IT'S A BIG ELEMENT OF IT WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRIC BUSES TO BE ADOPTING A RULE THAT REQUIRES ALL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO EVENTUALLY CONVERT TO ELECTRICAL PROCESSES -- WE ARE BOARD IS ALREADY ADOPTED A PLAN THAT WOULD HAVE US CONVERT OUR ENTIRE FLEET TO ZERO EMISSION BUSES BY TWENTY THIRTY WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO START RECEIVING THE FIRST -- ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE I BELIEVE OF THOSE BUSES NEXT YEAR THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES TO THAT BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL VERY EXPENSIVE VEHICLES DON'T PROVIDE A RANGE OF SERVICES WE NEED AT THIS TIME AND I SHOULD NOTE THE THE UTILITY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ARE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE COST OF THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE NOT TO MENTION HOW MUCH WE'RE GONNA END UP PAYING FOR LIKE TRICITY IS GOING TO BE A BIG CHALLENGE IN IN MAKING THAT CONVERSION TO HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU AND AND -- JOHN ON NO WE'VE LOST TO TO TO DISTRICT SEVEN ABOUT THE QUESTION WOULD BE THE SAME NAME THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IS FOR EACH REGION FOR EACH COUNTY WHAT SORT OF STEPS CAN BE TAKEN TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE LOCAL CONTRACTORS GETTING GETTING THOSE LOCAL JOBS AND GIVING YOU THE THE DIDN'T HIRING LOCAL PEOPLE WHERE I THINK THE PRIMARY FOCUS WOULD HAVE TO BE -- THE OUTREACH EFFORTS SO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE HAVING PRE BID MEETINGS CONTRACTORS ENCOURAGING THEM BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A STATE CONTRACT ACT ACT -- THAT DOES NOT ALLOW US TO SELECT LIKE WITHIN A SPECIFIC COUNTY BUT ENCOURAGING THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE OUT REACHING TO SOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES AN EXISTING CONTRACTORS -- WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THAT COUNTY IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD NEED FROM THE STATE THAT WOULD ALLOW A PARTICULAR COUNTY THEN TO HELP HELP EIGHT DUE TO TO TO TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO LOCAL CONTRACTORS -- LIKE I SAID WE HAVE THE STATE CONTRACT ACT SO I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY ALLOWABLE FOR US TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO LOCAL CONTRACTORS BUT THE OUTRAGE AND THE PRE PRE PRE BID MEETING RECONSTRUCTION MEETING PRE PRE BID MEETINGS HAS PREPARED MEETINGS -- IS ONE AVENUE -- WE ALSO HAVE A SMALL SMALL STATEWIDE SMALL BUSINESS COUNCIL -- OF THAT WE ARE ACTIVE IN AND WE MEET -- I THINK SIX TIMES A YEAR HERE TO ARE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THE SMALL BUSINESSES TO GET OUT AND WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND EXPRESSED TO THEM THAT NEED FOR FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING FOR THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTS THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE NO QUESTIONS FROM FROM THE PUBLIC SO I THINK THAT SOME OF MEMBER THAT WOULD BE THE LAST QUESTION FOR PANEL TODAY AND I DO APPRECIATE IT CERTAINLY ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED -- ENSURING THE INFORMATION WITH US LAW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS ARE ARE VALUABLE I THINK NOT ONLY FOR THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE HOLD THEM BUT THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE MEMBERS BECAUSE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FROM EXPERTS AND ALSO TO SEE HOW THE DECISIONS IMPACT VERY SPECIFICALLY TO COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT AND SO FOR MANY OF THE ALL ALL PROFESSIONALS WHO PRESENTED THEMSELVES TODAY IT REALLY GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE INTIMATE WITH THE IMPACTS OF OUR DECISIONS AND THE AND ALSO TO HEAR HOW WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DOING OUR JOB I REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AS WE HELD THE SIZE OF HEARINGS IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE SANGAMON VALLEY THE COMMENTS CAME BACK LOCAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT IT NEEDED TO PROJECTS AND SO OUT OF THAT -- IT IN INFORMED US TO THE POINT WHERE WE COULD GO BACK ON YOUR PART OF A CONVERSATION AND HELP STRUCTURE AND AND RESTAURANTS REMEMBER THAT SP ONE WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND COMING TOGETHER I MEAN IT TOOK A COUPLE OF SESSIONS BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO FINALLY COME UP WITH A PROPOSAL IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE COULD COULD GET GARNER BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OR AND MOVE FORWARD AND SO WE FIND OURSELVES AT A POINT NOW WHERE OBVIOUSLY OF THOSE FUNDS ARE IN JEOPARDY BUT I DO BELIEVE THE THE MORE INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS ABOUT PROJECTS THAT IMPACT ON THEIR COMMUNITY I THINK THAT THEY WILL SEE THE VALUE AND -- CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD -- I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT AND WE CAN BOTH BUT ALL OF US HAVE TAKEN NOTE TO THE VARIOUS COMMENTS THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO US AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN EARLIER PRESENTATIONS A REFERENCE TO SEEK REFORM AND ALSO -- FINDING SOME WAY AVENUE TO BRING BACK REDEVELOPMENT OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE IT HAS IT WAS A VALUABLE TOOL AND IT CAN BE AGAIN -- WE TRIED THIS YEAR -- WE WERE HOPING THAT AS GOVERNOR BROWN WAS FINISHING HIS LAST TERM GOOD -- -- HE WOULD KINDA LOSE THAT'LL GRINCH THE STOLE CHRISTMAS -- ATTITUDE AROUND REDEVELOPMENT AND MAYBE EMBRACES WAS CLEAR THAT THAT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND I DON'T MEAN THAT AS A CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE'S DONE A FANTASTIC JOB AND AND HE STANDS BEHIND US IF YOU WANT IT IS GOING TO BE CONTINUING TO STAND FOR ON MANY INITIATIVES THAT ARE OR ARE PROVEN TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE STATES OR PROCEDURES LEADERSHIP BUT BUT I THINK THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HAVING SOME TYPE OF A RE LOOK AT REDEVELOPMENT HOW THAT CAN BE STRUCTURES FOR TO HELP COMMUNITIES WILL BE VERY ESSENTIAL ESPECIALLY AS YOU SEE THESE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS SYSTEMS MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES AND IT WILL BRING LIKE IT DID IN MY COMMUNITY MY CITY OF PASADENA THAT I SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL ON IT BROUGHT -- TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT HOUSING IN THE DOWNTOWN IT SPURRED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE RETAIL CORRIDOR OPACITY IN IT WOULD NOT BE WHAT IT IS TODAY IF IT WERE NOT INVESTMENT OF PARKING STRUCTURES BUT ALSO -- HOW THE LIGHT RAIL HAS PROVIDED AN INCENTIVE IN AN ECONOMIC BOOST TO THAT PARTICULAR CITY CITY SO THE SAME TYPE OF CITIZEN OPPORTUNITIES EXIST US FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE REGION AND LASTLY LET ME JUST SAY HOW I REPRESENT A SMALL PART OF SAN BENITO COUNTY UP ONE AND A PORTION OF THE NORTHWEST PART OF RANCHO CUCAMONGA AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE INLAND EMPIRE OF YOU HAVE GREAT LEADERSHIP -- FROM ELOISE REYES AND FROM CONNIE LEYVA BUT THERE ARE A HOST OF OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY WHO SERVE ON AND WHEN EMPIRE CAUCUSES AND THERE IS CONTINUOUS DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES AND HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO DESIGN -- STRATEGIES OF SACRAMENTO THAT -- BILL TO AWAY LOCAL CONTROL BUT LOOK TO ENHANCE AND TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL CONTROL TO BE EVEN STRONGER AND MORE VITAL SO I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY I LEARNED A LOT YEAH SO OTHERS SO WE HAD HAD WE'RE HERE TODAY BUT THEY WERE WATCHING AND SO WE APPRECIATE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT THAT WAY -- LET ME ALSO THIS THANK MY STAFF BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY PUTTING THESE TYPE OF EVENTS ON ON -- IT REQUIRES A LOT OF OF FOCUSED PLANNING AND AND AND ENERGY SO I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR STUFF -- COLLECTIVELY BUT LIKE TO THINK BOBBY JOHNSON WHO SYSTEM I LEFT THEIR -- CONTINUOUS HARD WORK AND THEY'RE THEY'RE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS RIGHT AND IT WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE PROPER INFORMATION OUT TO THE COMMUNITY SO APPRECIATE THAT -- I ALSO HAVE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF -- COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT HELP ME FOCUS ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES AND WE HAD FOUR OF OUR -- COUNCILMEMBERS OR ADVISING MEMBERS HERE TODAY IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH AIDS PROJECT LISA LEVY BUSHINGS ALSO WAS COLD LINE AND -- BOB WAGNER TO THANK THEM FOR -- FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THEIR HELP HOME IN TERMS OF HELPING TO SHAPE THIS AND SO -- WITHOUT ALL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE AND THEY WILL I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN FOR COMING TO RANCHO CUCAMONGA IS A LOT CLOSER THAN GOING ALL THE WAY TO YOUR AREA AND I'M SO GLAD THE EMPHASIS ON SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY -- WE HAVE GREAT LEADERS WHO REPRESENT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY -- AND THE REASON THAT WE ARE GROWING AT THE RATE WE'RE GROWING IS BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH GREAT LEADERS WHO ARE COMMITTED AND I THINK THAT WHEN WE ALL WORK TOGETHER THAT'S WHEN THE COMMUNITY -- WILL MOVE IN THE DIRECTION THE TRAJECTORY FOR OUR COMMUNITY IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE SP ONE HAS PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME IT'S SUCH AN TO A PLEASURE TO VISIT WITH MY VARIOUS CITIES AND REMIND THEM THAT THEY'RE GETTING CHECKS EVERY SINGLE MONTH MONTH FROM IS THE ONE ONE IT IS A ONE TIME THING EVERY SINGLE MONTH ONE EIGHTY DOLLAR AMOUNT IS BEING DEPOSITED FOR EACH OF OUR CITIES EACH OF OUR COUNTY AND I HAVE CHECKED IN WITH ALL OF MY CITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT IS SB ONE MONEY AND THEY ALL TELL ME YES WE DO KNOW BECAUSE WE SEE THE DIFFERENCE AND WERE ABLE TO BEGIN NEW PROJECTS WITH OUR SP ONE MONEY AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE IS BENEFITING AGAIN YEAH -- CHAIR HOLDEN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS CONVENING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS ALL OF OUR PRESENTERS FOR PROVIDING SUCH GREAT INSIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WITH THAT WE ARE ADHOURNED
