A THREE POINT SIX MILLION CONFIRMED CASES OF CULVER NNETEEN IN CALIFORNIA RESULTING IN FIFTY NINE THOUSAND PLUS DOUBTS. THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET OUR STATE BACK TO NORMAL IS TO ADMINISTER VACCINES TO THE POPULATION.

HOWEVER BECAUSE THE OPTOMETRY PRACTICE ACT NARROWLY TAILORED LANGUAGE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES NECESSARY TO MAKE CLEAR THAT UP CONSCIOUS ARE ALSO ABLE TO PROVIDE THE VACCINATION.

IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE LAW CLEARLY STATES THAT OPTOMETRIST MAY PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THE FDA ANNOUNCED IN MID MARCH BUDGET IS DEVELOPING A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION FOR TRAINING TAX. STATING THAT TESTING REMAINS AN IMPORTANT CORNERSTONE OF OUR NATION'S FIGHT AGAINST COVERT NINETEEN. AT HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THAT ROUTINELY ADMINISTER OTHER VACCINATIONS AND CLEAR WAY PAST.

WHERE. COLLEAGUES THIS AGAIN FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN ASSEMBLY BILL TEN THIRTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. I'M SORRY MISTER CHAIR I HAD TO. FILE ITEM TEN IS- DOCTOR WITH THE BILL THAT'S WHY I WAS STARING BLANKLY- SO THIS IS- AB AT A TEN THIRTY FOUR- PERHAPS APPROPRIATE THAT IT'S- A FOUR TWENTY TODAY. I THINK IT'S NOT THE ONLY CANNABIS BILL THAT WE HAVE TO OF. HOPEFULLY I'LL GET TO WORK- THIS BILL PASSES WILL BE CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION IN ADDITION TO THAT WHICH MIGHT ALREADY BE OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HEY P. TEN THIRTY FOUR CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW THAT ALREADY- ALLOWS LOCAL JURISDICTION PERMIT CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. IF THEY WISH. I RESPECTFULLY DECLINE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AT THIS TIME BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE ISSUE IN A CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS IT. I SINCERELY APPRECIATE- AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK. ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN PERMIT CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES BUT THERE IS NO COMPARABLE CONSUMPTION LOUNGE LICENSE AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO LOCAL LOUNGES MUST RECEIVE A STATE RETAIL LICENSE. THIS BECOMES PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE STATE RULES FOR CANNABIS RETAIL LICENSE DON'T FULLY ALIGNED WITH THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. SPECIFICALLY CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES OPERATE THAT HOSPITALITY BUSINESSES SIMILAR TO BARS AND RESTAURANTS. NOT RETAIL OUTLETS. THE MOST CRITICAL DIFFERENCE IS THAT MOST CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOANS BUSINESS MODELS INCLUDE THE SALE OF NON CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES. NON ALCOHOLIC SIMILAR TO HOW BARS AND RESTAURANTS OPERATE. STATE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW CANNABIS BUSINESSES TO SELL ANY ITEMS OTHER THAN CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS THUS CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES ARE UNABLE TO SELL NON CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NON ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES HERE. AB TEN THIRTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PERMIT THE SALE AND PREPARATION OF NON CANNABIS FOOD AND NON ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES IN CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. THIS WOULD BE A COMPLETELY LOCAL DECISION NO CITY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERMIT IT. THE FOOD AND BEVERAGES PREPARED AND SOLD ON SITE WOULD NOT BE INFUSED WITH CANNABIS AND THE BEVERAGES WOULD BE AS I MENTIONED NON ALCOHOLIC. THIS BILL SIMPLY ALLOWS A LOCAL JURISDICTION TO ALLOW CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES TO ALSO PREPARE AND SELL NON CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES. THAT ARE NON ALCOHOLIC TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IF THEY WISH AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TEN THIRTY FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. IN A STAND THAT WE HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT. OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR THE PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. THE LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN MINOR NINE THE COMMUNITY AND LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD. I ALSO LEAD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CITY'S CANNABIS WORKING. AS MENTIONED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AB TEN THIRTY FOUR WILL ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE ABILITY TO PERMIT THE SALE AND PREPARATION OF NON CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES YOU CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. THE SALE IN PREPARATION OF NON CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMPTION LOUNGES BECAUSE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BLEW MENTIONED THEY OPERATE AS HOSPITALITY BUSINESSES. AS OPPOSED TO RETAIL STORES. IN THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD WE WILL BE PERMITTED UP TO SIXTEEN CANNABIS CONSUMPTION. WITHOUT THE CHANGES IN AB TEN THIRTY FOUR CONSUMPTION LOUNGES INCLUDING THOSE IN WEST HOLLYWOOD WILL BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY NON CANNABIS. BEVERAGE PROJECTS THE PRODUCT. LIBERTY AND OTHER NEARBY BUSINESSES. SIMILAR TO HOW WE WOULD HAVE FOOD DELIVERED TO OUR HOUSE. THIS IS AN INEFFICIENT BUSINESS MODEL AND DOES NOT ALLOW CANNABIS CONSUMPTION BY JUST TWO PEOPLE SERVICE HOSPITALITY BUSINESSES. AS CANNABIS CONSUMPTION INCREASE A TYPE OF BUSINESS IN THE STATE NOW IS THE TIME TO CLARIFY THE LAW. SO THE BUSINESSES AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR TENANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BUILT APPS WILL KNOW WHAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PREPARE AND SELL APPLICATION INCLUDING ON CAMPUS FOOD AND BEVERAGES. LASTLY I WOULD ADD THE ONLY DURING THE AT ONE CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES BE IN BY BUDGET. TO MEET THE DON'T ONE CONCERT LOUNGES NOT BE IN. IN CAN IN AND CAN TO SUCH ISSUES.

THANK YOU AGAIN AND A GOOD MORNING AGAIN THIS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'D FIRST LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIRELESS CONTINUE EFFORT WORKING. ON US WITH THE- ON THIS BILL AB TWELVE EIGHTY TO THE CALIFORNIA PET BLOOD BANK MODERNIZATION ACT SEEKS TO PHASE OUT THE OBSOLETE AND INHUMANE PRACTICE OF CAPTIVE CLOSED COLONY CANINE BLOOD BANKS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BY AUTHORIZING CALIFORNIA LICENSED VETERINARIANS TO OPERATE COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS TO PRODUCE AND SELL OR TRANSPORT TRANSFER ANIMAL BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS. VETERINARY TECHNICIANS AND VETERINARY ASSISTANCE MAY ALSO COLLECT THE BLOOD FROM AN ANIMAL UNDER DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED VETERINARIAN. THE BILL PLACES THE PRACTICE OF COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKING UNDER THE JURISDICTION AND OVERSIGHT OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. EXCUSE ME AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO MODERNIZES CALIFORNIA LAW BY PROVIDING A SAFE ETHICALLY SOURCED ANIMAL BLOOD SUPPLY FOR USE IN VETERINARY PRACTICE. THE BILL AUTHORIZES COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS WHICH ARE SIMILAR TO HUMAN BLOOD BANKS IN THE SENSE THAT ALLOWS BLOOD COLLECTION FROM PETS WHOSE OWNERS HAVE VOLUNTARILY CONSENTED TO THE DONATION. CURRENTLY THIS VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BLOOD COMMUNITY BASED APPROACH ISN'T ALLOWED IN CALIFORNIA AT ALL. INSTEAD CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT REQUIRES ANIMAL BLOOD TO COME FROM SO CALLED CLOSED COLONY BLOOD BANKS. IN CLOSE CALL IN THE BLOOD BANKS BLOOD IS SOURCE FROM DOGS THAT ARE CAPPED HOUSED OR MAINTAINED AT A FACILITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING THEIR BLOOD. THESE CLOTHES COLONY BLOOD BANKS REQUIRE HUNDREDS OF DOGS TO BE IN CAGES FOR YEARS WHILE THEIR BLOOD IS ROUTINELY HARVESTED. I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT CLOSE COLONY CONDITIONS THAT KEEP CANINES CAGED IN TIGHT SPACES DEPRIVED OF EXERCISE AND MENTAL STIMULATION. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO ALLOWS FOR A MORE HUMANE SOLUTION FOR SOURCING ANIMAL BLOOD WHILE ALSO ESTABLISHING CONDITIONS TO EVENTUALLY PHASE OUT CAPTIVE CLOSE QUALITY CANINE BLOOD BANKS. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WAS RECENTLY AMENDED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAVE RAISED IN OUR DISCUSSIONS OVER THE PAST YEARS. THE BILL NOW ENSURES THAT COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS FOLLOW THE BEST MOST RECENT CLINICAL PRACTICES AND STANDARDS FOR VETERINARY TRANSFUSION MEDICINE AND DIRECTS THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD TO UPON APPROPRIATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE HIRE A CONSULTANT TO ASSIST IN DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES FOR VETERINARIANS TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY'RE OPERATING COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS. THOSE MOST AFFECTED BY THIS LEGISLATION OR THE VETERINARIANS WHO MUST HAVE RELIABLE SOURCES OF BLOOD AND BLOOD COMPONENTS TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE DOGS AND CATS IN THEIR HOSPITALS. ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS OF THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS ENSURING THAT BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE ONCE THOSE LAWS IMPLEMENTED. AND THAT THE QUALITY OF THESE PRODUCTS IS MAINTAINED. MY STAFF AND I ARE CONTINUED ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE C. VMA AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF FINDING THE APPROPRIATE TRIGGER FOR THE PHASE OUT OF THE CLOSE CALL IN THE MODEL. THE APRIL FIFTEENTH AMENDED VERSION OF THE BILL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THIS CONCERN AS THERE IS LANGUAGE IN PLACE THAT REQUIRES BLOOD PRODUCTS TO BE EQUAL TO OR EXCEED THE AVERAGE AMOUNT. THAT CLOSED COLONY BLOOD BANK SOLD IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY BEFORE FULLY DISCONTINUING CLOSE COLONY CANINE BLOOD BANKS. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WOULD EVENTUALLY PHASE OUT AND ELIMINATE THE USE OF CAPTIVE CLOSE COLONY CANINE BLOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA. ONCE IT IS DETERMINED THAT COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS ARE PRODUCING EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE SUPPLY OF BLOOD PRODUCED CURRENTLY BY CAPTIVE BLOOD BANKS. MEMBERS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SENATOR WILK AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PASSIONATELY FOR THREE YEARS AND IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE THE YEAR VETERINARIANS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THE AFFECTED STATE DEPARTMENTS. CAN ALL AGREE THAT IT ETHICALLY SOURCED SAFE AND EXPANDED ANIMAL BLOOD SUPPLY FOR VETERINARY USE IS NECESSARY AND POSSIBLE. CALLING IN TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OR DOCTOR CAN PULASKI THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR AT INSIGHT VETERINARY WELLNESS CENTER.

OKAY TO GIVE YOU HAS GOT KILEY PAUSE FOR A MOMENT I WILL BE THERE SHORTLY AND SO AGAIN WE'LL GO BACK TO OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE EIGHTY TWO. OKAY THE- OTHERS CAN PULL OUT YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES OKAY. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I AM TESTIFYING TODAY TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO TO HELP INCREASE IN ASSURING THE ADEQUATE STATE SUPPLY CHAIN I BLOOD PREVENTING OR ANYTHING CALIFORNIA. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SINCERELY THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM FIRST PERSON PARENTS AND PERSISTENCE ON THIS ISSUE. I KNOW IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING. MY NAME IS DR KEN PULASKI AND I AM A VETERINARIAN LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR AND OWNER OF INSECT VETERINARY WELLNESS CENTER. A SMALL ANIMAL HOSPITAL IN ELDORADO HILLS PROVIDING PRIMARY CARE TWENTY FOUR HOUR EMERGENCY CARE. WE CURRENTLY HAVE EIGHT VETERINARIANS INCLUDING A FULL TIME BOARDED CRITICAL US PLUS A PART TIME INTERNIST AND CONTRACTED CARDIOLOGISTS AND SURGEONS. PRIOR TO OPENING OUR HOSPITAL LAST YEAR WE OWN TO BANFIELD HOSPITALS DAYTIME GENERAL PRACTICES. IN THOSE HOSPITALS ARE NEED FOR BLOOD IS FAIRLY RARE AND IF WE DID NEED IT WE CAN USUALLY COLLECTED FROM ONE OF OUR STAFF PAT BURKE IT WAS MORE CRITICAL WE REFERRED TO AN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL. NOW IS AN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL IS A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME. WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE WILL NEED BLOOD OR BLOOD PRODUCTS. BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE PETS IN NEED. OFTEN REQUIRING MULTIPLE UNITS. WE HAD ONE MASTER'S-LEVEL SERGIO SURGERY RECENTLY ENDED UP NEEDING FOUR UNITS OF WHOLE BLOOD OR PACKED RED BLOOD CELLS AND FOUR UNITS OF PLASMA. AFTER USING OUR IN HOUSE LAST NIGHT ANY UNIT OF BLOOD COLLECTED FROM THE TECHNICIANS DOGS WE HAD TO BORROW BLOOD AND PLASMA FROM THREE OTHER EMERGENCY HOSPITALS INCLUDING ONE ALL THE WAY OUT AND FAIRFIELD. EFFECTIVELY WIPING OUT THE BLOOD SUPPLY IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA. THIS FORCES US TO MAKE HARD CHOICES BETWEEN WHICH PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE BLOOD PRODUCTS. THERE SIMPLY IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH BLOOD TO THE PATIENTS WHO NEED IT. WELL I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS FOR THE DOGS THAT ARE CONFINED TO THE TO CLOSE COLONY BLOOD BANKS. MY BIGGER CONCERN IS RELATED TO THE INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR PATIENTS. THESE TWO COMPANIES SIMPLY CANNOT SUPPLY THE NEEDS OF CRITICALLY ILL AND INJURED PACKING CALIFORNIA. THAT IS WHY I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WHICH WILL ALLOW VETERINARIANS TO ESTABLISH COMMUNITY BASED BLOOD BANKS TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE BLOOD AVAILABLE TO OUR PATIENTS. IN ADDITION IT WILL ALLOW US TO IMPORT THESE PRODUCTS FROM OUT OF STATE AS LONG AS THEY MEET OUR SAFETY STANDARDS. WE ALSO NEED TO BE ASSURED THAT BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS COMING FROM ALL SOURCES REMAIN SAFE. SO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES BE ESTABLISHED TO ASSURE NOT ONLY AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY BUT ALSO SIX O'CLOCK. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION TO ALLOW FOR SETTING UP THESE GUIDELINES. I TRULY HOPE NONE OF YOUR PETS EVER NEEDS A TRANSFUSION. BUT IF THEY WOULD WHAT DO YOU WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE WAS BLOOD AVAILABLE FOR THEM. PLEASE VOTE HI AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO.
