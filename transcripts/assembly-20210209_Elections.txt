THE PROBABILITY THAT ILLEGITIMATE VOTES WERE CAST AND COUNTED. YEAH IF YOU SEE A SENT A LETTER TO CALIFORNIA'S SECRETARY OF SECRETARY STATE INTERVIEW APRIL TWENTY TWENTY WHAT THE REPORT SHOWING OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND LIKELY BETTER RELOCATED PERSON.

AS A REMINDER IT- EITHER WAS IT DOESN'T MATTER NO ONE'S HERE ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY SHARES HERE TO. THANK YOU POSTERS MISTER CHAIR MY SPEAKER ON YEAH. THERE WE GO PERFECT. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU SENATOR AMBER FOR- PRESENTING THIS BILL THIS MORNING AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS OVER OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING THIS PAST PANDEMIC AND- IT'S A LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR ADDRESSED- YEAH- WITH THE INFORMATION WE HAD HOWEVER THIS YEAR IS A NEW YEAR WE'VE LEARNED TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES- OF SAFETY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NOTICED IN THE LAST ELECTION WAS THE- CENTRALIZATION OF POLLING PLACES FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE DISTRUSTED IN THE SYSTEM AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THOSE- CAUSED VOTING DAY LINES AT SECTOR- THAT EXACERBATED THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE BEING EXPOSED MORE EXPOSED TO EACH OTHER. INSTEAD OF MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAD WHERE WE HAD MORE OF A DECENTRALIZED VOTING SYSTEM. SO THAT IS A CONCERN MY OTHER CONCERN IS THIS. WE HAVE. A LOT OF DISTRUST NOW IN OUR VOTING SYSTEMS. AND. TWO THOUSAND ONE THERE IS A COMMISSION AND IT WAS- THE PUBLIC TO OF THE CHAIRS WERE GERALD FORD AND JIMMY CARTER BOTH PRESIDENTS- AND ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE WAS THIS A DAY WERE SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED ABOUT VOTER BY MAIL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR PEOPLE TO ABUSE THAT- AND ORGANIZATIONS TO ABUSE THAT PROCESS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF- YEAH LIKE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF CASES INVOLVING NURSING HOMES WHERE PEOPLE WENT IN AND DID YOU KNOW- HARVESTED BALLOTS OUT OF NURSING HOMES WITHOUT REALLY THE KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PEOPLE. FOR US TO HAVE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT AND CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH OF FURTHER ALIENATING. A LOT OF PEOPLE AND CREATNG MORE DISTRUST WITHOUT ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES OF THE BALLOT INTEGRITY. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT- THIS BILL- SO- WITHOUT A LOT OF AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS. AND REGAIN THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC WHICH IS SOMETHING WE DESPERATELY HAVE TO DO IN THE STATE- IT I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL SO I DO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT TO US. MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE STRUCTURE I WOULD LIKE TO COMPLEMENT THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- I THINK WE'VE HEARD- THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY OVER AND OVER AGAIN CONCERNS OF THE SENSUALLY- THE WHOLE ISSUE OF DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY HAS HAS BEEN IN FRONT OF US AND ON THE BALLOT- AND WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE I THINK IT'S JUST ANOTHER. EXAMPLE OF TRYING TO HELP VOTERS TO BE ABLE TO- IN GAUGE IN THAT- RIGHT TO VOTING THAT THEY HAVE SO- WE OVER AND OVER AGAIN HAVE HEARD COMPLAINTS ABOUT POTENTIAL FRAUD AND YET WEEKS WE SHOULD HAVE CONSTANTLY WE DON'T SEE ANY SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE OF FRAUD OUT THERE- AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S- THE TICKET. HACK INTO TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS IF IT IS A SIGNIFICANT FRAUD ISSUE WITHOUT THAT EVIDENCE- DOESN'T DO US ANY FAVORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR BRINGING US FOR. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT IS RUBIO. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU- FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE I WANTED TO SAY A FEW WORDS ON HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO STAND IN THE LEGACY OF FORMER ASSEMBLY WOMAN NOW SECRETARY OF STATE DR SHIRLEY WEBER AND I KNOW THAT HER WORK IN THE SERVING THAT CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED AND SOUL I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I. UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY COMMUNITIES THE EXCITEMENT FROM FROM VOTERS I HAD NEVER VOTED BEFORE AND HOW. GOOD THEY FELT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AND WE SAW THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF OUR VOTER TURNOUT NOT JUST IN THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY BY SPECIFICALLY MY DISTRICT AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THOSE FOLKS HAD FELT DISENFRANCHISED BECAUSE THE IT WASN'T EASY FOR THEM TO- PARTICIPATE IN OUR SYSTEM BUT THIS WILL HELP. AND I THINK- RE ENGAGE AND ENGAGE NEW VOTERS I THANK YOU FOR- THE YOU KNOW BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AGAIN I HOPE THAT THOSE ISSUES OF DISTRUST- ARE FIXED BUT A LOT OF TIMES THAT THIS TRUST IS BASED ON- RHETORIC AND IF WE CAN FIND A REAL. ISSUES TO ADDRESS THEM I THINK WE SHOULD DO SO HOWEVER IF WE'RE BASING THAT DISTRUST ON RHETORIC THAT I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT THE ADVANTAGES. OF THE YOU KNOW THE- BEING ABLE TO VOTE- BY MAIL AND AGAIN THAT THE PART TO SIT. THAT HAS INCREASED BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SHOULD SAY WELCOME TO THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO IS A MEMBER BENNETT ADVICE OR C. R. GO WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE. ALL THREE OF YOU- MISTER MAYES. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND OTHERS QUESTIONED- EITHER FOR OF THE AUTHOR OR HE WOULD EVEN INVITE THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT TO. THE TO CHIME IN AS WELL- OTHER STATES- IN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE ALL MAIL BALLOTS- THANK YOU SOME OF MY ROOMMATES YET YES I BELIEVE THERE ARE FIVE THAT HAD ALL BILL IN ELECTIONS PRIOR TO. TWENTY TWENTY. AND IN THOSE STATES- IS THERE WIDESPREAD FRAUD IN THOSE IN THOSE STATES. WELL I WOULD SUSPECT NOT OF YOUR SO FOR EXAMPLE STATE OF UTAH- WHICH IS HAD MAIL IN ALL MAIL ELECTIONS FOR SOME TIME HAS OVERWHELMINGLY REPUBLICAN. REPRESENTATION SO MY GUESS IS THAT THEY'VE NOT EXPERIENCED WIDESPREAD FRAUD. ARE THERE ANY PROVISIONS IN THOSE STATES THAT ALLOW FOR ALL MAIL BALLOTS THAT- THAT THEY HAVE A THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT TO MAKE SURE TO REDUCE FRAUD IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I THINK WE'VE INCORPORATED- SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY SO FOR EXAMPLE- ONE OF BALLOTS IS. MAILED THERE'S A BAR CODE ON THE BALLOT COMES BACK THAT BARCODE IS CHECKED AGAINST THE ORIGINAL BARCODE THERE WAS MAIL WHICH IS ALSO CHECKED AGAINST THE SIGNATURE. YOU HAVE TO BE A REGISTERED VOTER IN ORDER TO GET A MAIL IN BALLOT SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE PROVIDED YOUR SIGNATURE TO THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS AT SOME POINT IN TIME IN THOSE SIGNATURES ARE CROSS CHECKED AND INDEED SOMETIMES- IF THE SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH OF THE SIGNATURES. ARE QUESTIONABLE THAT BALLOT IS NOT COUNTED. GREAT THEY YOU TO CHER IS THAT NOTHING QUESTIONS JUST REAL QUICK COMMENT- I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS AT TODAY. I KNOW THIS IS A TEMPORARY PROVISION TO GO TELL- UP UNTIL JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE SOME OF THE LEGISLATION- THAT WOULD- UP PROVIDE FOR- CALIFORNIA TO BE AN ALL MAIL BALLOT. I'M STATE- I MADE STRONG SUPPORTER OF THAT I HAVE BEEN SINCE I FIRST BECAME A PERMANENT ABSENTEE VOTER. I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN- TWENTY YEARS AGO- OUR GOAL AS A LEGISLATURE A NEEDS TO BE TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO GET AS AS MUCH. I MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE MAKE SURE THAT- THERE PROPERLY PROPER REGISTERED VOTERS AND THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO BE ABLE TO VOTE THAT THEIR LEGAL VOTES THAT ARE CAST BUT LET'S MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE. TO BE ABLE TO VOTE SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES MR LOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIR CENTER NUMBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING- THIS MEASURE FORD- IT'S A CONTINUATION OF THE- A PARTNERSHIP NOT ONLY. IN THE- ESSENCE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO THE WORK OF BOTH THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN BERMAN AS WELL. AND APPRECIATE THE TWO HOUSES WORKING TOGETHER. TO THE BENEFIT OF. THE RECOGNITION THAT. THEY COULD THIS COMMITTEE MAKE UP AS DOWN NOW CHANGED. I'VE SERVED AS A LEGISLATIVE STAFFER FOR THE FORMER CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAUL FONG. AS WELL AS SERVING AS FORMER CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. AS WELL AS BEING A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. AND I JUST HAVE TO SPEAK OUT. ON THE ON THE TESTIMONY FROM THE ELECTIONS INTEGRITY PROJECT BECAUSE- WE'D- IT IS SO OFFENSIVE IT MUST NOT GO WITHOUT BEING CHALLENGED AND JUST FOR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO BE. WELL AWARE OF WHAT THE ELECTIONS INTEGRITY PROJECT IS. REGISTERED WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. ELECTIONS INTEGRITY PROJECT A WYOMING CORPORATION. AUTHORIZED TO DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE DAY COMMENTARY FROM THEY REPRESENTED FROM THE ELECTIONS INTEGRITY PROJECTS SAID THAT THIS WAS THE VOTING. THE VOTING SYSTEMS AND THE TURNOUT WAS A DISASTER AND THAT IS COMPLETELY COUNTER TO THE FUNDAMENTAL. LANGUAGE THAT OF ELECTIONS INTEGRITY AND THAT WE HAVE ELECTIONS INTEGRITY.

AND IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO SPEAK WITH A SENSE. OF PASSION AND RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND WE SUPPORT OUR ELECTIONS INTEGRITY AND SO AGAIN I SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A BUNCH OF RHETORIC BUT I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH BIPARTISAN FASHION TO HAVE REGISTRARS INTO DO TOWARDS HERSELF TO. OPEN UP AND BE AS TRANSPARENT I'VE SEEN IT I WELCOME YOU TO PUT IN THE WORK PUT IN THE WORK AND NOT JUST EMPTY RHETORIC TO DO SO AND AGAIN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE TESTIMONY OF THIS ORGANIZATION ELECTIONS A TEDDY PROJECT THE COMPLETE FALSEHOOD FROM WYOMING.

AND WE HAVE GONE THROUGH EVERYONE THAT IS GREAT SO THE PUBLIC COMMENT IS CUT OFF MOVING BACK TO ANY COLLEAGUES THAT WANT TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE BILL SEEING NONE- CENTER AMBERG. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. OF I CAN INTEGRITY IS A PERSONAL ISSUE WITH ME- SOME. THIRTY PLUS YEARS AGO ALL IN ORANGE COUNTY. ONE GROUP POSTED PEOPLE DRESSED AS POLICE OFFICERS WITH SIZES THAT NONCITIZENS MAY NOT VOTE. FOR THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF. EVENTING LATINOS FROM VOTE- THAT WAS AN OUTRAGE THERE WAS A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION I WAS IN THE WEST IS OFFICE THE TIME AND I RAN AGAINST THE PERSON WHO BENEFITTED FROM THAT ACTIVITY- AND ACTUALLY ONE. IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND SO WHEN I CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY BOTH TIMES THE SECOND TIME FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I CHAIR THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND AT THAT POINT THE ISSUES OF ELECTION FRAUD WERE BEING RAISED AND I ASKED IMPLORED BY ASKING EMPLOYER AGAIN TODAY THAT IF YOU NOW ALL OF A VIOLATION OF THE LAW YOU SHOULD REPORT IT USUALLY REPORTED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SURE REPORT YOUR LOCAL POLICE- YOUR YOUR YOUR LOCAL POLICE YOU SHOULD REPORT IT TO THE U. S. ATTORNEY. WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT ELECTION INTEGRITY- THOSE REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN REALLY FORTHCOMING. THERE BEEN SOME INVESTIGATIONS BUT REALLY. THERE'S NO. SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE OF VOTER FRAUD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER SARTELL THAT CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO A DEMOCRACY HOWEVER MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS ELECTION IN PARTICULAR. HAS BEEN DANGEROUS WE SAW WHEN MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION WITH DISSEMINATED FROM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN PEOPLE LOSE FAITH IN THE THIRTY ELECTION. THEY RESORT TO EXTRAORDINARY MEANS THEN TO ASSERT THEIR WILL OVER RUNNING THE CAPITAL. IT IS CRITICAL THAT ACCURATE INFORMATION BE DISSEMINATED ABOUT OUR ELECTION PROCESS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME OF THE FOLKS ON THE PHONE HAD TO SAY WE HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY ELECTION AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT FOLKS BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS FRAUD TO THE EXTENT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LISTENING BELIEVES WHAT. THEY SHOULD CONTACT THE FOR REPUBLICANS THAT BEAT THE FOUR DEMOCRATS WHO WERE IN OFFICE AND LET THEM KNOW NO DOUBT THE RESIGNED AT THAT POINT ONCE THEY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS ISSUE I'M BEING A BIT SARCASTIC. BUT IT IS TRUE THAT IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS WAS ELECTION WHERE ACCORDING TO BILL BARR. THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL ACCORDING TO MITCH MCCONNELL. THIS ELECTION WAS RUN WITH INTEGRITY AND SO. BY EXTENDING THE PROTECTIONS OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION HERE WHEN WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. DESKS ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST. CASES ARE EXTREMELY HIGH. THE INCIDENCE OF TRANSMISSION IS STILL EXTREMELY HIGH IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PASSED THIS MEASURE SO I URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU US SENATOR AND- YOU YOU YOU RIGHTFULLY USE THE TERMS OF MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION WE HAD A CALL USE THE TERM RHETORIC THAT'S ALL ACCURATE- BUT I WANT TO BE MORE BLUNT. WILL HAVE LOST FAITH IN OUR ELECTION SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN LIED TO. THEY'VE BEEN LIED TO BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THEY'VE BEEN LIED TO BY FEDERAL AND STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING. ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THIS BUILDING NOT AT THIS DAIS. BUT IN THIS BUILDING- AND THEY HAVE BEEN LIGHT AND IN THIS LINE. THAT IS HAPPENED OVER AND OVER AGAIN AROUND THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTION IN TWENTY TWENTY. HAS DIRECTLY UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY- AND IT DIRECTLY LED TO THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITAL ON JANUARY SIXTH- AND IT YEAH I SEE IN OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT THE ARSONISTS THE LIARS. ARE NOW CLAIMING THAT THEY HAVE THE SOLUTION. TO THE FIRE THAT'S RAGING TO THE DISINFORMATION IN THE DISTRUST THAT EXISTS. BY CLAMPING DOWN AND PASSING VOTER SUPPRESSION LAWS- AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD A- REMARKABLY TRANSPARENT OPEN SUCCESSFUL ELECTION. IN TWENTY TWENTY. WE HAD SOME OF THE HIGHEST TURNOUT IN GENERATIONS. THAT WE'VE HAD IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE A LOT OF. ACCUSATIONS THAT ARE BEING THROWN AROUND WITH ZERO EVIDENCE- AS THE SENDER SAID SO IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE. PROVIDE YOUR EVIDENCE SOME THINGS THAT WERE SAID CALIFORNIA'S VOTER ROLLS ARE NOT CLEAN ARE ACCURATE. INTERMENT ARE AND ARE NOT MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW THIS IS FALSE. WITH MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE ON THE VOTER ROLLS STATEWIDE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A SMALL NUMBER OF RECORDS. THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT RECENT DEATHS AND CHANGES IN VOTER ADDRESSES. THERE ARE MEASURES IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA TO UPDATE VOTER LISTS. AS REQUIRED BY STATE AND FEDERAL LAW IN A SAFETY GUARD AGAINST FRAUD. CALIFORNIA GETS DEATH RECORDS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ON A WEEKLY BASIS WE GET FELONY RECORDS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ON A MONTHLY BASIS. AND WE GET CHANGE OF ADDRESS INFORMATION FROM THE DMV ON A DAILY BASIS. AND RUN THOSE AGAINST THE STATEWIDE VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE. THE STATE ALSO GETS NATIONAL CHANGE OF ADDRESS INFORMATION. TO CHECK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED OUT OF STATE. NO I ALREADY SPOKE TO THE ACCUSATIONS OF WIDESPREAD FRAUD IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT SIMPLY DON'T EXIST- AND ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT IT CLAIMS THAT THEY FOUND MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND REGISTERED. CALIFORNIA VOTERS WHO HAVE LIKELY DIED OR MOVED POLITIFACT LOOKED AT THIS CLAIM AND FOUND THAT ELECTION EXPERTS WERE HIGHLY SKEPTICAL. OF THE GROUP'S FIGURE INSTEAD OF THE MENORES MEASURES USED TO UPDATE VOTER ROLLS WHICH I SPOKE TO A MINUTE AGO. AND THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PREVENT FRAUD. SO I GET VERY FRUSTRATED BY PEOPLE. THAT THAT THROW AROUND BASELESS ACCUSATIONS THAT UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY AND LET'S BE CLEAR THAT THAT IS WHAT. THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING. SO I APPRECIATE THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING YOUR BILL TODAY. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. ON ELECTIONS ISSUES- I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE IN A NEW ROLE- OVER IN THE SENATE- AND IT. STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT AND I VOTE FOR YOUR BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BERMAN. HI BERMAN HI SAY ARTURO. NO SE ARTO NO SENATE. SENATE HI LOW LOW HI MAYES MAYES HI MULLIN HI MULLIN HI RUBIO RUBIO HI. AT SIX TO ONE THANK YOU THAT BILL PASSES ON A SIX TO ONE VOTE. THANK YOU AND THE MEETING IS ADJOURNED.
