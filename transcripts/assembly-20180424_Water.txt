EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX TO SENSE THAT THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND PROVIDE THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES ESTABLISHED BY THE DELTA. REFORM ACT. THE GOVERNOR'S BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IDENTIFIED CERTAIN POLICIES AND DIRECTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE DELTA. AND CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY. SOME OF THERE RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ROLLED INTO THE DELTA REFORM ACT TO REQUIRE REGIONAL SELF RELIANCE. AND. I'LL. IF EMPHASIZE THIS POINT DECREASE DEPENDENCE ON THE DELTA. THAT REPORT ALSO INCLUDE REQUIRING GREATER INPUT FROM THE DELTA COUNTIES TO ASSIST WITH THE DELTA PLAN. SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN FULFILLED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. IN FACT AS OPPOSITION HAS RECOGNIZED THE COUNCIL'S GONE OUT OF ITS WAY TO SUPPRESS INPUT FROM DELTA INTERESTS. THE COUNCIL IS CONTINUE TO DRAG THEIR FEET ON PROPER FUNDING STRATEGIES FOR FOR DELTA LEVEES BY PUTTING MORE STRESS ON FARMERS AND DELTA COMMUNITIES. THERE'S NOT BEEN A STATE WIDE APPROACH HAS MANY TRY TO ARGUE AND THE COUNCIL TOO OFTEN HAS ACTED AS A RUBBER STAMP FOR THE INTEREST OF METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT. OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO FORCE THROUGH THE TWIN TOTAL PLAN. BY TRANSFERRING DUTIES TO THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION THE STATE CAN SAVE UP TO TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND PUT THE ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF THE DELTA PLAN AND LEVY INVESTMENT STRATEGY. WITH A MORE ABLE BODY. WITH ME TODAY IS SACRAMENTO COUNTY SUPERVISOR DONNA TOTALLY WHO IS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. TO PROVIDE COMMENTS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE COUNTIES. OKAY. THANK YOU SO MEMBER FRAZIER AND GOOD MORNING A CHORE GARCIA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. PLANNED ON A TOTALLY I'M A MEMBER THE SECRETARY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

I'M ALSO HERE REPRESENTING A MITE DEL THE COUNTY COALITION COLLEAGUES FOR THE COUNTIES OF YELLOW SOLANO CONTRA COSTA. AND SEVENTEEN TOGETHER WE REPRESENT FOUR MILLION RESIDENTS OF WHICH MORE THAN A HALF A MILLION LIVIN RESIDE AND WORK IN THE DELTA. I'M HERE DALY OFFER SUPPORT FOR SIMILAR FRASIER'S BILL. BECAUSE REPRESENTS A STRONG NEED FOR DELTA CENTRIC REPRESENTATION. DON'T ISSUES ARE INCREDIBLY DIVERSE INCLUDE AGRICULTURE WATER TOURISM VOTING FISHERIES. ECOSYSTEM THE ENVIRONMENT. WHICH ALL TOGETHER MAKE TO DEL THEY TRULY UNIQUE AND SPECIAL PLACE. AS A LONGTIME COUNTY SUPERVISOR I HAVE SERVED FOR MORE THAN TWENTY THREE YEARS IN THE DELTA PROTECTION MISSION.

WE'VE TAKEN OUR CHARGE SERIOUSLY. AND ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TIME TELL TO RESOURCES. TO THE THREE CURRENT GOVERNMENT BODIES WHICH GUIDED OVERSEE THE DELTA. DOES BEING THE DUST STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL PROTECTION COMMISSION ADULT CONSERVANCY. AND WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR A GREATER DECISION MAKING ROLE IN THE GOVERNANCE. AND IN THE DECISIONS ON MATTERS AFFECTING THE DELTA. RECOGNIZE IT TO DOUBLE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IS A STATEWIDE BODY WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT CONSTRUCT OF IDIOCY IS NOT A TRUE REPRESENTATION OF THE DELTA COMMUNITY. POLICY DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS OUGHT TO BE DONE EQUITABLY AND FAIRLY AND THIS REQUIRES ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION. THE DELTA COMMUNITY IS DESERVING OF A FAIR AND STRONG REPRESENTATION ON ANY DECISION MAKING BODY. BECAUSE THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES THEIR LIVELIHOODS IN THE WELL BEING AND THEIR FUTURE ARE AT STAKE. THE STATE'S CURRENT POLICY TRAJECTORY COULD HAVE A FAR REACHING AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE DELTA AS WE KNOW IT. AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX PROVIDES GREATER REPRESENTATION IN THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS. IMPROPERLY ASSURES THE INTEREST WAS DEALT ARE FAIRLY REPRESENTED IN DECISION MAKING INDECISION WHICH SERVE TO PROTECT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CATHY COLE WITH METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ON BEHALF OF THE FORTY THREE SIGNATORIES TOOK COALITION LETTER THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THIS COMMITTEE. I HEARD YOU KNOW VOTE ON AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX. THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA IS OF STATEWIDE SIGNIFICANCE AS WELL AS AN INTENSE INTEREST UNDERSTANDABLY FOR THOSE WHO LIVE THERE. AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STATEWIDE APPROACH ADVANCING PROGRESS IN THE DELTA AS ENCOMPASSES IN A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE LEGISLATION PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. THAT HISTORIC PACKAGE ADVANCE STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE OF THE DELTA FOR TOMORROW MENTAL AND WATER SUPPLY VALUES FOR RECOGNIZING PROTECTION OF THE DELTA ITSELF AS INVOLVING PLACE. THE TWO THOUSAND NINE PACKAGE CREATED THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL TO BETTER COORDINATE ACTIONS OF SOME TWO HUNDRED LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES. THAT IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER HAD JURISDICTION OVER ISSUES IMPACTING THE DELTA. TO COORDINATE THOSE ACTIONS UNDER A SINGLE DELTA PLAN. THIS PACKAGE ALSO RESTRUCTURED THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION TO BE A MORE LOCALLY REPRESENTATIVE BODY ANTICIPATED THE DPC CHAIR TO SERVE ON THE COUNCIL. WE'VE YOU MISTER FRAZIER SPELL AS AN ATTEMPT TO FRUSTRATE EFFORTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR INBOUND SOLUTIONS IN THE DELTA BY TRANSFERRING DUTIES TO AN ENTITY THAT IS DOMINATED BY INTEL TO INTEREST. AND THAT LIKELY UNDO THE STATE WHAT APPROACH TO DELTA POLICY BY PUTTING ONE REGION'S AGENDA BEFORE THE OTHERS. I DO TAKE ISSUE WITH CHARACTERIZING THE COUNCIL AS A SHOW FOR THE DELTA TUNNELS THIS BILL SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT ANY GIVEN ACTION THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT WHO'S THE BEST CRAFT AND IMPLEMENT OVERARCHING PLANNING DOCUMENT. WE FEAR A MISTER FRASIER'S BILL PUTS THE BRAKE ON ADVANCING TO SAY POLICY AND THE STATE WHAT APPROACH DELTA MANAGEMENT FOR THE FUTURE AND FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE OUR LOW FAT. THANK THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THAT BOB GREBER THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF DESERT WATER AGENCY ROLAND WATER DISTRICT IN THE VALLEY ATWATER COALITION. IN OPPOSITION TO DATA AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX. I THINK WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE A FORMATION OF THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AS PART OF A LARGE PACKAGE THAT REFORM TO THE MATTER IN WHICH THE DELTA. WOULD BE DEALT WITH. NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF UP PROTECTING THAT. BUT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS A. AS MUCH AS IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS OF THE DELTA. THE DELTAS OF AN INTERNATIONAL NATIONAL AND STATE WIDE IMPORTANCE. CHANGING THE GOVERNANCE MODEL THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL REALLY IS AN ANATHEMA TO THE ROLE OF THE COUNCIL. OF THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION HAS ITS PURPOSE THE DELTA CONSERVANCY HAS ITS PURPOSE. AND THE OTHER TWO HUNDRED FEDERAL STATE REGIONAL LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE THEIR OWN RESPECTIVE PURPOSES. STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THROUGH THE DELTA PLAN THAT PLANNING PROJECTS AND EXPENDITURES. A PARK COME TOGETHER TO BALANCE COMPETING USES TO ENSURE THAT WATER SUPPLY FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS IS MAINTAINED AND THAT THE ECOSYSTEM THE DELTAS RESTORED. SO WIN WIN YOU. WHEN YOU MOVE THE VENUE IF YOU WELL FROM THE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL TO THE DOUBTS PROTECTION COMMISSION. YOU SHIFTED A ON ON RECENTLY TOWARDS A DELTA CENTRIC FOR FOCUS. IT IS THE WRONG APPROACH WE WIN WE ALSO NEED REMIND THE COMMITTEE THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THE STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES ROLES OUR DUTIES. OF THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL THAT REMAINS AND INTACT SO ALL YOU'RE DOING WITH THIS LEGISLATION. IS SHIFTING THE GOVERNANCE IN THE FOCUS FROM A STATEWIDE FOCUS TO DELTA CENTER. AND IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO DO SO AND WE WERE RESPECTFULLY QUEST IN ABOUT THANK YOU BY THOSE WHO LIKE TO. I HAD. THE OPPOSITION THE STATE YOUR NAME AND THEM. REPRESENTATION OF ORGANIZATION. GOOD MORNING NAM MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SAID MANNING WITH KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF MOJAVE WATER AGENCY IN WHAT SENSE WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION.

GOOD MORNING BETH A LOT SO ON BEHALF OF INLAND EMPIRE UTILITIES AGENCY IN CUCAMONGA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION HAVE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO REG DOT POSITION FOR IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT WHO COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MONICA MILLER REPRESENTING THE SENATE CLEVERLY WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION BANKIA. VALERIE NARROW FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. SARS DIVERSE MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT OF ORANGE COUNTY IN OPPOSITION. CHRIS* REPRESENT THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION. CANDIDATES ARE GONE BEHALF OF THE KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY IN THE SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION. STEVE BAKER WITH THEIR REDUCES HITS FOR THE UPPER SAN GABRIEL VALLEY MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON. OKAY SEEN NONE I WILL LOVE BRING BACK TO THE DYESS AND. COLLEAGUES. MEMBERS AND QUESTIONS. DR. YEAH. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK GO WHY IN THE A MIDDLE OFF A BIG PROJECTS ARE GOING ON SUCH AS A. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S IN THE PROJECT WATER FAKES A PROJECT COME. DO. OR THE SUR ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THE GOVERNING STRUCTURE OF WHAT THE TRUE MOTIVATION OF THIS HIS HAS SUCH AS THE MAKEUP. OF THE F. COUNSELOR WHO EMEKA. MORE FAVORABLE POSITION REGIONALLY FIGHT THE. HOPE. MISTER CHOICE THE THE WHOLE REASON IS IS THAT THERE IS A STATE GOVERNMENTS REPRESENTATION ON THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION ALSO APPOINTEES BY THE GOVERNOR FROM DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED. NO THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD OF WITH THE BDC P.. THEN THE DOUBLE TUNNELS ANOTHER TIME A SINGLE TITLES. SO THAT PROCESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TUNNEL VISION. FOR THIS COUNCIL TO HIT THIS PROJECT GOING FOR YOU SEE THE OPPOSITION IS CLEARLY THE BENEFACTORS OF THIS PROJECT. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS LET'S KITTY. A REGIONAL AND A STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE GOING FORWARD YOU LOOK AT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FUNDING. THE THE. DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND A LOT OF MY RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN JUST ALIENATED BITE TIMING ON MEETINGS AND WHAT NOT WHERE THEY CAN'T MAKE MAKING A MAKE IT TO THE MEETINGS. FOR THEIR VIEWPOINT ON THIS PROJECT. DON'T PROTECTION COMMISSIONS ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS I I WAS SERVED ON THERE FOR PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT YEARS I SERVE ON THE DELTA CONSERVANCY. NOW HAS AN APPOINTMENT BY OUR SPEAKER. A. SUPERVISOR TOLLEY A SENSE IT'S ALMOST ITS INCEPTION HAS BEEN ON THAT THE. PR TO DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION SO YOU LOOK AT. THE DIFFERENT KIND OF OF OF OF VALUES THAT THIS THIS AGENCY BRINGS. AND WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IT'S SEGREGATED AND THAT THE STATEWIDE APPROACH OF THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. WE ARE TO. AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE AGENCIES IN PLACE. THAT ARE REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT. OR NOT BASED ON A FAIR AND AND BALANCED APPROACH WITH THE COURT WEEK WILL GOAL. OF MAKING SURE THE DELTA IS PROTECTED BUT THE WATER SUPPLY. FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAN BE DONE IN A REASONABLE APPROACH. THAT'S ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR. THEN I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE AS A MEMBER COMING FROM THAT MAKE THESE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IS YOU KNOW. WATERS. VERY ABUNDANT IN THE THEM CALIFORNIAN THAT DOES TO REGION BUT I'M NOT IN A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THE. ORIGIN ON A ACTIVITIES ARE BY DISA. YA KNOW DOES DOES JOSEPH BEAU COUNCIL A WHAT WAS TO REPRESENTING MORE NASA ENTIRE. CALIFORNIA RATHER THAN FOCUSING UPON THE REGION ON INTEREST OFTEN BECAUSE PACKED AREA. SO THIS A GOVERNING BODY RESTRUCTURING IS SIR TO ME APPEARS TO BE OUT ATTEMPTED. TO. TOWN. OFFSET THAT THAT. IN A BALANCED OF CORAL CURRENTLY MEMBERSHIP MAKEUP OF DHEA OF DOES DOES TOO STOOD STILL SHIP COMES. SIR THIS IS NOT ABOUT ABUNDANCE OF WATER THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE DECIMATION OF AN ECOSYSTEM. THAT COULD BE COMPLETELY RUINED BY THE APPROACH OF A FEW TO TO BENEFIT. TWO THIRDS OF THE POPULATION STATE BUT DAMAGE THE ECONOMY OF A THIRD WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALSO. IS THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT WATER. SPECIFIC THIS IS ABOUT ENDANGERED SPECIES ALSO. THERE'S THERE'S FISH AND FAUNA THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS DECISION MAKING PROCESS. YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T BUILD THIS PROJECT IN IN. IN THE. A COURT OF. AREA OF WHERE IT'S BUILT ARE IN NEAR TRACY CALIFORNIA. A TO PROVIDE A COLD THE SACK OF PULLING WATER IN FROM THE DELTA REVERSING THE FLOW OF THE DELTA TO PROVIDE WATER TO. OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OF SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE MAY BE MORE REASONABLE APPROACHES BUT WE NEED A NON BIASED LOOK. AGAIN ALL OF THE OPPONENTS ARE BENEFACTORS. TO THIS PROJECT AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS A MORE FAIR BALANCED. UNBIASED APPROACH THAT TAKING OTHER FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION THIS ONCE WAS THE BT CP WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES HUNDREDS OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND MAKERS OF MITIGATION FOR CONSERVATION. TO ENHANCE IN IN THE. DELTA THAT'S BEEN THROWN BY THE WAYSIDE FIRST IT WAS ABOUT A MAKING THE DELTA BETTER. NOT JUST BECOME ABOUT WATER WHO AND. WE ARE SAYING THAT SPECIES ARE INVOLVED IN AN ECONOMY IS INVOLVED. DRINKING WATER IN OUR AREAS INVOLVED A LOT OF THOSE FACTORS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN A FAIR AND REASONABLE FASHION. OKAY I THINK OF THOSE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION NOW FROM. MY OPINION. IT IS A VERY. AND UNBALANCED. MAKE UP AND DOWN A TRYING TO CREATE. A DELAY SIGN THE IDEA PROPOSED A DATA PROTECTION THE OF COMMISSION AND WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND OFFICIIS YOU ATTENDING JETTA. ó AND ONE ISSUES. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT TELL ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS. WITH A NO WATER INSTANT A SEVEN CALIFORNIA. A WE WISH TO HUMAN. OUR LIFE SO OR FOR. A ENDANGERED SPECIES. ó AND DO YOU KNOW IF OUR WATER FLOWS TOWN VIA IS SEE ENDANGERED SPECIES OF FISH USE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUGH. IN ORDER WOULD BE VIRTUALLY YA COME HOME FREELY AFFECTED I THINK THAT HAS BEEN ALL CONSIDER AT THE END UP AND MOST OF PROPOSED AND HAS BEEN. A SUBMITTED AND THAT WORKED OUT THE WIKIPEDIA OR REGIONAL CONTESTS TO SHIP COMES OF THAT'S MY OPINION. AND YOU SERVE VERY MUCH ENTITLED TO THAT I'VE LIVED IN THE DELTA REGION FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS. AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS THAT WE DO HAVE DROUGHT AND WATER CANNOT FLOW IN ANY PROJECT BECAUSE OF LOW FLOWS. AND I THINK THERE'S A PROTECTION THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ABOUT YOUR CONSTITUENTS ALSO THAT IF WATER IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THIS PROJECT. THAT THAT THAT THAT WE FEEL THAT THIS. S. COUNCILS TRYING TO PROMOTE. THAT YOUR RATES ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE THROUGH THE SKY AND THE TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED DRAMATICALLY. IF WE HAVE A DECADE LOUD RHODEN A. DECADE LONG DROUGHT A. THAT PROJECT IS IS NOT NONEXISTENT OR THEY'LL BE EFFORTS TO A. TAKE. A SPECIES INSTEAD OF BANQUET SPEECH OF FEET PEOPLE AND PROFITS BEFORE SPECIES AND THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF ALSO. A THIS THIS PROJECT DOES IT. ALLOW FOR ONE ADDITIONAL DROP OF WATER IT CIRCUMVENTS THE PLUMBING ON THE DELTA INCREASES THE SALINITY LEVELS COMING UP FORWARD. AND SO I I I BEG TO DIFFER AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR OPINION. AND WE WILL HAVE THAT NORTH SOUTH KIND OF A. LOOK AT THINGS BUT THE. AGAIN. I AM AFRAID OF WHAT THIS PROJECT IN THIS COUNCIL HAS OF THE APPROACH TO DUE. TO DAMAGE MY FARMERS MY RECREATION MY DRINKING WATER YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR DRINKING WATER. SO MY. SO MY AND WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE RELIANT ON THAT. TOOK TO LIVE AND SO. WE KNOW THE INITIAL PROJECT WAS BUILT. IT DIDN'T WORK. IT IS A IT'S AN AFFECT ON THE SPECIES OF THE OF THE DELTA. AND WE THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME MORE REASONABLE APPROACHES THAT COULD BE TAKEN. A BEFORE WE ARE HAVE A PROJECT THAT WILL SIPHON OFF. THOUSANDS OF CUBIC FEET PER MINUTE OF WATER. I THAT WOULD NORMALLY GIVE A FLUSH TO THE CALIFORNIA DELTA. AND KEEP THE SALINITY LEVELS DOWN. OF WHERE THEY REMAIN NOW AND NO CONSIDERATION OF OF OF SEA LEVEL RISES BEEN IN IN MY OPINION HAS BEEN FACTORED IN ALSO ON HOW THIS CAN AFFECT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES IN MY AREA SO AGAIN. MARK TWAIN SAID. IT WHISKEYS FOR DRINKING WATERS HER FIGHT. QUESTION FROM A SUMMER MATHIS. I'M. QUIT QUITE FRANKLY I THINK WE NEEDED. STAR LOOKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON THE DELTA. BEING THE ONLY SOURCE TO GET WATER SOUTH. THEY I REALLY WISH WE DON'T TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS ON. DO YOU CELLS A HUGE OPTION. QUITE FRANKLY THAT THE LAST FOUR YEARS SINCE WE'VE ALL BEEN UP HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE PUSHING FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS WERE PUSHING FOR WATER GOALS. ON THE OTHER STATE IN IN THIS IS NOTHING ON YOU MISTER FREIGHTER. THAT THE STATE'S LOOKING AT SHUTTING DOWN DIABLO GRANDET. OUR LAST NUCLEAR REACTOR THEY'VE STATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO DE SALLE. JUST BY DOING AN INCREASE IN THEIR INTAKE PIE. AND WE ALL KNOW THE DELTA WATER. ITS NEXT STOP WHERE GETS HELD IN THE STATE WATER PROJECTS IS THE SOUND THOSE THREADS WAR. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO POP DESALINATED WATER INTO THE ST LOUIS RESERVOIR AND REFILL IT ON A CONTINUAL BASIS. STATING THIS TODAY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT REAL LIFE THIS. AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS IS A VIABLE OPTION AND. AND IT LEAVES THE DELTA COMPLETELY INTACT OR NOT MESSING WITH THAT NAM MESSING WITH THE SPECIES ON MESSING WITH ANY OF THAT. AND SIMPLY TAKING DESALINATED WATER. FEELING THAT. REST OF WAR WHERE WE MOVE ALL THE DOUBTS WATER ANYWAY. ON A REGULAR BASIS WHICH IS A LOT MORE WATER THAN IT'S GETTING FROM THE DELTA ANYWAY. SO I'M MAKING THAT COMMENT TODAY BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY I'M SICK OF HEARING THAT OUR ONLY OPTION IS THE DELTA. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAX. THAT STRAIGHT ACTUAR DOLLARS WHEN YOU HAVE THE ABILITY FOR A PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. THAT HAS A BETTER RELIABLE SOURCE THAT'S NOT GOING BE DEPENDENT UPON CLIMB IT. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS. ON I'M NOT GONNA BE VOTING ON YOUR BILL TODAY. BUT I THINK WE AS A STATE NEED TO WALK AT OTHER WAYS AND OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE MUCH MUCH MORE VIABLE. ON AND ARE GONNA COSTS ARE TAXPAYERS LESS MONEY. ON IT AND GET OUT OF THIS BOX THAT WE SEEM TRAPPED. MR MATHESON I'D I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR OF. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. TROUBLES ME AS THE CHAIRMAN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND WE'VE SEEN MEGA PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA LIKE THE BAY BRIDGE. AND NOW HIGH SPEED RAY RAIL. THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN TOLD ONE THING. AND ANOTHER THING OCCURS THEY GET INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT AND THEN IT BECOMES A LARGER THAN LIFE. ISSUE THAT. NOW WE HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS. THIS IS WHAT I'M AFRAID OF ALSO IN THIS PROJECT THE RATEPAYERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AGAIN WILL BE. OF SOLD A BILL OF GOODS NO PUN INTENDED. AND IN THE PROJECT BE DRAMATICALLY MORE EXPENSIVE. BECAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS. AND SO A AS YOU'VE MENTIONED ALSO IN. MY AREA IT PITTSBURG IN ANTIOCH WE HAVE DECOMMISSIONED POWER PLANTS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DISTILL WATER. IN THIS BRACKISH WATER. AREAS. NEVER BEEN FACTORED IN AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND AND AND AS FAR AS I KNOW BUT AGAIN WITH IF IT'S A SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLAR PROJECTED PROJECT. THAT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN D. SELL PLANTS. THAT COULD PRODUCE ABOUT A BILLION GALLONS OF WATER A DAY. NEW WATER. THIS PROJECT DOES NOT. BUILD ONE DROP OF ADDITIONAL WATER COMING THROUGH THOSE TUNNELS. AND SO I'M LOOKING FOR A FAIR AND UNBIASED OPINION ABOUT HOW WE CAN FROM MOVE FURTHER AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT ALSO PROVIDE A NOT SO NECESSARY. WATER OF PRODUCTS FOR THEM AYE NEWMAN BAREST WHAT THE NEW SCORING'S OF THE WATER BOARD THEY CAME OUT RECENTLY IN THAT ARE STORAGES. BEEN OF SCORED SO LOW THAT THERE ARE WATER BOND WILL BE INEFFECTIVE. BASED ON A WHAT I VOTED ON. AND SO YOU KNOW I'M. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT CALIFORNIA'S NOT TAKING A LEAD IN SERVICING THE NEEDS AN APPROPRIATE FASHION. AWAY TOO TO ACCOMMODATE FUTURE GROWTH. BUT ALSO. A RESPONSIBLE STEWARD OF THE OF THE OF THE ENVIRONMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THERE. HELP MET MISTER FRAZIER LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. ON OTHER VIABLE OPTIONS ON THE AS YOU STATED THAT THE POWER PLANT DE CELL OPTION IS IS AN EXTREMELY VIABLE OPTION ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET INTO LOOKING AT. CONVERSIONS THE BIOMASS AS WELL WHICH ON THE ARENA LOCAL SO I'D I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU. MOVING FORWARD ON SOME. IDEAS AROUND THAT I LOOK FOR TO THAT SIR THANK YOU. AND SEE ANYONE ELSE. QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM IT THE BUT DEPUTY LIKE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO. MAKE YOUR CLOTHES STATEMENTS AND. I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK. THE COMMISSION DO. THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT HOW. THE PROCESS IF YOU LOOK HOW IT'S MOVE FORWARD AND IF YOU LOOK HOW THE PROCESS. GOES. THAT IT IS A TUNNEL VISION PLAN AND NO PUN INTENDED IT'S NEEDS TO BE MORE. FAIRLY APPROACHED. AND WE THINK THAT. THIS APPROACH BY PUTTING IN THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION% WHICH WE BOTH SERVED I DON'T SERVE ON THERE ANYMORE IT'S NOT. FOR ME TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN. BUT BEING IN THIS REGION SEEING THAT THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT WORK TOGETHER. THIS WE FEEL CAN ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THE CO EQUAL GOAL OF OF OF PRODUCING WATER BUT ALSO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IS SO VALUABLE TO CALIFORNIA. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR. THANK YOU. BUT HAVE ANOTHER AUTHOR. I AM TO A BE TWENTY ONE NINETY ONE. O'DONNELL YOU I YOU MAYBE GET A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AGAIN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE NINETY ONE WHICH WILL DIRECT THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL TO CREATE THE WHITE SHARK THE POPULATION MONITORING AND BEACH SAFETY PROGRAM. OZ. TO KEEP IT SIMPLE S. HUMANS INTERACT MORE WITH SHARKS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND SHARK BEHAVIOR THAT'S THAT'S THE EFFORT HERE. DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS THERE'S BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARK SIGHTINGS OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST. OF COURSE I COME FROM LONG BEACH. AND OTHERS MORE THE LONG BEACH AREA MY KIDS ARE IN THE WATER OUT THERE ON THE WATER OUT THERE MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES OUT THERE WE'VE GOT YOU YOUR GUARDS OUT THERE. AND THERE BEEN MORE SHARK SIGHTINGS THEY'VE HAD BEEN PULLED PULLED THEY'VE HAD TO BE IN A BAND BE PULLED OUT OF THE WATER. MANY TIMES DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS BECAUSE THAT THE THE INTERACTIONS WITH SHARKS OR THAT THE. THE PROXIMITY TO TO THE SHARKS WE NEED TO GET IT CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT. WELL THIS INCREASE IS A GREAT SIGN FOR THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM THIS INCREASED ACTIVITY MAKES HUMAN SHARK INTERACTIONS MORE LIGHTLY LIKELY FOR SURE. WHEN THESE INTERACTIONS GO WRONG THEY STOKE FEARS AND CALIFORNIA'S BEACH GOERS AND CAN EVEN END IN TRAGEDY THERE'S ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AS WELL BECAUSE. BUT THERE'S A SHARK SIGHTINGS THAT WE IN THE NEWSPAPER AND PEOPLE WILL NOT GO TO VISIT CERTAIN AREAS OF OUR STATE. BECAUSE THEY'VE HEARD YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN SHARK ACTIVITY. THANK THANKFULLY COOPERATIVE EFFORTS EFFORTS BY RESEARCHERS LIKE THOSE WITH THE SHARK LAB. AT CSU LONG BEACH HAVE PARTNER WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND NON PROFITS TO MONITOR SHARKS STUDY THEIR BEHAVIORS AND EDUCATE. THE PUBLIC. THESE EFFORTS HELP PREVENT INCIDENTS QUELL UNJUSTIFIED FEARS AND PROVIDE THE DATA NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND AND PRESERVE OUR MARINE ECOSYSTEM. HOWEVER THESE EFFORTS CAN ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE THEIR WORK. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER OF SHARKS AT OUR BEACHES WAS SO HIGH. RESEARCHERS AT THAT CSU AT THAT CSU LONG BEACH SHARK LAB RAT OUT OF TRACKING TAGS TO PUT ON SHARKS PART WAY THROUGH THE SEASON. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ARE EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND THESE CREATURES PROTECT BEACH GOERS ENSURE TOURISTS AREN'T SCARED OFF FROM CALIFORNIA BEACHES WE MUST BE WILLING TO INVEST IN THOSE. WHO ARE IN OUR WATERS DOING THE WORK? AB TWENTY ONE NINETY ONE MAKES THIS INVESTMENT BY CREATING A GRANT PROGRAM FOR ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS PUBLIC AGENCIES AND NON PROFITS EXPERIENCE CAN ENGAGE IN SHARK RESEARCH. A AND B. AND OUR BEACH SAFETY EFFORTS. THIS IS A HUMAN ISSUE THE ZEN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE BUT AGAIN I I AS I SAID STATE EARLY IT'S ALSO AN ECONOMIC ISSUE BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME TO OUR CALIFORNIA. A WITH ME HERE TODAY A TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AS DOCTOR CHRIS LOW HE'S DIRECTOR OF THE SHARK LAB AT CSU LONG BEACH AND ALICE KESSLER FROM THE YEAR. THE CITY OF LONG BEACH AND YOU MAY KNOW DOCTOR LOW IF YOU WATCH SHARK WEEK YOU'VE SEEN HIM HE'S THE SHARK WEEK GUY. HE IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE FOREMOST WORLD EXPERTS ON SHARK BEHAVIOR AND US I TURN IT OVER TO THEM. THANK YOU SO. WE'VE KNOWN THAT PRIVATE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS FLETCHER POPULATION SEEMS TO BE INCREASING AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS REALLY SIMPLE WE PROTECTED WHITE SHARKS HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THE WHICH OUR POPULATIONS BEEN AFFECTED FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS BECAUSE A LOSS OF MARINE MAMMALS. IF YOU DO IT HER AND ALSO PROTECTION. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS WHAT CHURCH COMING BACK BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT THEM. THE TRICKY PART IS WE'VE LACK THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY STUDY WHITE CHURCH AND NOW THAT THERE POPULATIONS COMING BACK WITH ONE'S REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THE NURSERY FOR WHITE SHARKS. IN. IN THAT NORTHEAST PACIFIC SIR WHAT THAT MEANS IS CHARTER COMING IN AND THEY'RE USING THEIR BEACH HABITATS SAME HABITATS AT SURFERS AND SWIMMERS HE'S. THAT HABITAT APPEARS TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE SHARKS AND OF COURSE ONCE THEY MATURE THEY MOVED EITHER FURTHER NORTH TO THAT CHANNEL ISLANDS OR THEY MOVED TO THE FAIR LINES. WHERE THEY'RE FEEDING PRIMARILY ON MARINE MAMMALS IN THAT POPULATIONS OF THOSE POPULATIONS HAVE RECOVERED FAIRLY WELL SUSIE COULD FEATURES? BUT IT'S THE ONLY THE YEAR IN THE JUVENILES HERRING VERY CLOSE TO WHERE PEOPLE ARE AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN STUDYING FOR LAST. TEN YEARS NOW WITH FUNDING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF FUNDING FROM MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM. WE NOW HAVE ALL THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S LITERALLY DEVELOP LAST FIVE YEARS THAT WILL ENABLE US TO ANSWER ALL THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. THAT MANY THE THE WATER SAFETY PERSONNEL NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S THAT SCIENCE THAT CAN BE USED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND ALSO WATER SAFETY PERSONNEL. SO THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY DO THEIR JOB IN THE PUBLIC OF SAFER BUT USING SOME CALIFORNIA WATERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALICE KESSLER HERE REPRESENTING THE CITY OF LONG BEACH UP WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. THE POPULATION GROWTH OF GREAT WHITE SHARKS HAS IMPACTED LONG BEACH IN MULTIPLE WAYS. THREE THINGS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FIRST OF. THE CITY AS OUR AUTHOR MENTION DOES PROVIDE MULTIPLE MARINE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. AND. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE THERE WERE TEN GREAT WHITE SIGHTINGS AND IT IT DOES AS WAS MENTIONED. STRIKE FEAR AND. THOSE THAT ARE SEEKING TO WRECK RATE ON OUR BEACHES SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PURSUE THE POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT WILL MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE. SECOND. LONG BEACH DOZEN JOY A UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SHARK LAB. NOT ONLY IS IT SITUATED AND IN LONG BEACH BUT. IT COLLABORATES CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF THE POPULATION GROWTH. IN THE SHARK LAB WOULD BE ABLE TO TO APPLY FOR GRANTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM. TO SUPPORT ITS WORK TO REDUCE SHARK ATTACKS ON BY USING THESE MORE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGIES. AND THEN LASTLY THE CITY ITSELF COULD APPLY FOR GRANTS UNDER THE PROGRAM. THROW FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OUR DEPARTMENT PARKS RECREATION AND MARINE. TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE ON OUR BEACHES SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU OF THOSE I WISH TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF AB. TWENTY ONE NINETY ONE A GOOD MORNING CAO ON THE SECOND CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. A MULE FROM FROM THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM IN SUPPORT. KIM DELFINO DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN SUPPORT THANKS TO ANYONE ELSE. SHOULD WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM. AB BUT THANK YOU ED ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL.

IT DIRECTS THE STATE WATER BOARD TO PRIORITIZE TEMPORARY WATER RIGHT PERMITS FOR PROJECTS THAT ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF A LOCAL OR STATE. AGENCY TO CAPTURE HIGH RUNOFF EVENTS FOR LOCAL STORAGE OR RECHARGE. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO SUSPENDS THE PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT FOR STATE WATER BOARD ACTIONS ON THESE TYPES OF TEMPORARY PERMITS. THE GOAL OF THESE PERMITS IS TO CAPTURE HIGH PRECIPITATION EVENTS. AND STORE WATER THAT WOULD OTHERWISE FLOW OUT TO THE OCEAN. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONCE IN A DECADE TYPE RAIN EVENTS LIKE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WATER YEAR. TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THESE TYPES OF PERMITS YOU MUST DEMONSTRATE THE BENEFICIAL USE OF WATER DIVERTED. THIS IS THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL. UNDER AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WOULD BE CONSIDERED A BENEFICIAL USE CONSISTENT WITH GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. A PP I SEE REPORT TITLED REPLENISHING GROUND WATER IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHICH WAS RELEASED LAST WEEK STATED. THAT SOME MANAGERS RECOMMENDED THE STATE WATER BOARD TO FIND RECHARGE AS A BENEFICIAL USE TO REINTERPRET DEUCE UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF IT TO USE. WITH THE UPCOMING SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT IMPLEMENTATION. EVERY TOOL IS NEEDED IN ORDER FOR CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS. TO BECOME COMPLIANT. AS WE KNOW MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE FACING CHALLENGES OF IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGNAL. AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE WILL HELP COMMUNITIES AND USERS IN MY DISTRICT AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA. TO IMPLEMENT SIGMA BY USING RECHARGE TO ITS FULLEST POTENTIAL. BY NO MEANS DO I THINK THAT THIS IS THE ULTIMATE ANSWER TO SOLVE OUR WATER PROBLEMS. AND HELP PREPARE FOR SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THIS. WILL HELP MOVE OUR CONVERSATIONS FORWARD. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DON CAMERON FROM TERRANOVA RANCH. AND IF HE MAKES IT IN TIME STACEY SULLIVAN. THE DIRECT THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION BEAT BEFORE YOU PROCEED I'M GOING TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM SO THAT WERE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION. THINK ARE ON THIS BILL MEMSIC TRIPS BELOW. EDUARDO GARCIA. GALLAGHER HERE BIGELOW AS A. CARILLO. CHOI HERE. CHIU THEIR. FRIEDMAN. GLORIA HERE. HARPER PRESENT. KALRA. LEVINE. MATHIS. RUBIO. SOLIS WOULD. THANK YOU WE MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DON CAMERON LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN CHAIRMAN GARCIA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. MAY LOSE. ANYWHERE BETWEEN HALF A MILLION AND A MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND BY TWENTY FORTY TWO THE SECOND IMPLEMENTATION. I FARMING FRESNO COUNTY WHICH IS WITHIN THE KING SUBBASIN. THAT ENCOMPASSES ABOUT A MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND. THIS IS A CRITICALLY OVERDRAFT BASIN BY SICKNESS DEFINITIONS REQUIRING A PLAN TO BE IN PLACE BY TWENTY TWENTY. THE BASIN IS OVER CRAFTED. BY PROBABLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. IN TWENTY ELEVEN TWENTY ELEVEN WAS THE FLOOD YEAR SENATE TURNOVER RANCH WE BEGAN. A FLOOD WATER CAPTURE PROGRAM THAT INTENTIONALLY BEGAN FLOODING WINE GRAPES FOR UP TO FIVE MONTHS DURING THE GROWING SEASON. WE WERE CALLED CRAZY BY A LOT OF OUR NEIGHBORS. BUT WE WERE ABLE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO THAT RECHARGE UP TO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED ACRE FEET OF FLOODWATER THAT YEAR. AND WE DIDN'T KILLER VINEYARD. TWENTY ELEVEN. KIND OF. I EARNED THE NICKNAME OF THE FATHER OF GROUNDWATER RECHARGE OR PROBABLY MORE APTLY. APPROPRIATE GRANDFATHER GRANTHA FOR. SOME GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. BUT WE ALSO CAPTURED THE WE FLIPPED IT FEEL PART OF PLANNING A CROP PROVING THAT WE COULD TERM FARMLAND INTO US LARGE RECHARGE AREAS. TO CAPTURE THE FLOODWATER WHILE IMPROVING GROUNDWATER CONDITIONS AT THE SAME TIME. LAST YEAR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET LEFT THE BASE AND DID FLOOD RELEASE THAT WERE LOST TO THE OCEAN. WEEKS FLAT AS WE EXPAND OUR PROJECT TO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE BEGAN FLOODING WALLETS. ALMONDS SPECIALS AN OLIVE WITH. PUSHING IT TO THE LIMIT. FOR THE PURPOSE OF GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. WE DID THIS DURING THE PERIOD FROM NOW FEBRUARY THROUGH JULY. IT'S THE BIT WITH PRETTY UNPRECEDENTED. WE HAVE A VINEYARD ONE VINEYARD THAT LAST YEAR WE PUT THIRTEEN ACRE FEET OF WATER ON FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. WE EXPANDED OUR PROJECT DEATH CLICK SAY TO TO OVER. FIVE THOUSAND ACRES. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. NOT ONLY DOES THIS WATER REPLENISH OUR AQUIFER BUT IT PROVIDES HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE. PRIMARILY SHOREBIRDS AND WATERFOWL WE HAD ALL TYPES OF BIRDS COMING INTO OUR REGION JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE APPLIED THE WATER TO OUR FIELDS. WE EVEN HAD SENATOR FEINSTEIN VISITOR PROJECT TO AND OFFER HER SUPPORT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE FLOODWATER BECAUSE LEVY BREAKS AND FLOODING DOWNSTREAM TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND OTHER FARM LAND ON ITS WAY TO THE OCEAN. THE TERRANOVA WERE EXPANDING OUR RECHARGE EFFORTS WERE BUILDING MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL ENABLE US TO CAPTURE. UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER MONTH WHEN FLOODWATERS AVAILABLE TO SPREAD ON UP TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF. OUR FARM AND OUR NEIGHBORS FARMS. BY RECHARGING IN OUR AREA WERE STARTING TO. REBUILD THE AQUIFER. TO CORRECT NOT ONLY OUR BASIN. SURROUNDING BASINS TO THE WEST BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WATER DOESN'T REMAIN IN ONE PLACE IT DEFTLY MOVES FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER. AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE IS NEEDED EVEN MORE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. WE EXPECT A THREE. INCREASING WATER FLOWS FOR INFLOWS HIGHER. HIGHER SNOW LEVELS TO WHERE NORMALLY WE READ WE CAN HOLD OUR WATER IN THE. STERN ABOUT A. THIS A GOOD OR A REAL GAME CHANGER FOR US THEN. IT CAN ALLOW GROWERS THEMSELVES TO REBUILD THE UNDERGROUND WATER SUPPLY FOR FARMING AND FOR COMMUNITIES. BY CAPTURING FLOOD WATER AND STORING THEM UNDERGROUND. A REALLY SIMPLE CONT A CONCEPT SUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU THINK KICKS HIS THEA HASTY ARRIVAL. STACEY SOLOMON ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR STABLE CONSERVATION. LAW AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. A WE REQUEST THAT. THIS BILL RECEIVE AN AYE VOTE IN ORDER TO ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE TO SERVE. AS A VEHICLE FOR DISCUSSION NEGOTIATION RESOLUTION OF IMPORTANT ISSUES CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA. AND THE REPLENISHMENT STATES VITAL GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES. SUSTAIN CONSERVATION HAS BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ADVANCING GROUNDWATER RECHARGE SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH DON CAMERON. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING PRIMARILY THE NOT EXCLUSIVELY ON ON FARM. Y. RECHARGE. WE UNDERSTOOD OBVIOUSLY WE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF RECHARGE BEFORE SIGMA BUT THE PASSAGE OF THAT ACT MADE OUR AWARENESS AND A RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS OF RECHARGE THAT MUCH HIGHER. WE ARE. WE BELIEVE THAT RECHARGE WILL BE VITAL TO IMPLEMENTING SIGMA IN A WAY THAT MITIGATES ITS IMPACT BY ENHANCING SUPPLY. I AND THE BERRIES IN EMPLOYING RECHARGE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT NEAT BE REDUCED TO REMOVED WHILE PROTECTING EXISTING WATER RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL USES. ALL WE KNOW THAT THE BENEFICIAL USE ISSUE IS HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS. ARE WE BELIEVE THAT WATER MANAGERS DEEP UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED WITH RECHARGE PRAGUE PROJECTS WITHOUT. RISKING REGULATORY ACTION HAS BEEN BOTH THE CAUSE AND RESULT OF A GREAT DEAL OF THAT CONTENTION. THAT UNCERTAINTY NEEDS TO BE REMOVED SO THAT GSA'S AND OTHERS CAN UTILIZE RECHARGE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE. A WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE AND THE ANALYSIS OR A VERY POSITIVE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION WE SUPPORT THEM WHOLEHEARTEDLY. BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO MAKE PROGRESS TO OF MAKE THE PROCESS FOR OBTAINING TEMPORARY WATER RIGHTS. ARE CURRENTLY FOUND IN EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS PERMANENT IT'S VITAL THAT GSA'S AND OTHER MANAGERS BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THESE TEMPORARY RIGHTS QUICKLY. ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE VERY TRANSITORY HIGH FLOWS THAT SAID WE ALSO SUPPORT EITHER FURTHER DEFINING IN LIMITING THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION. INCLUDED THAT PROCESS CAN BE EMPLOYED OR FINDING OTHER MECHANISMS THAT PROVIDE BOTH QUICK RESPONSE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. WE RECOGNIZE AGAIN THAT THE ISSUES HERE KILEY CONTROVERSIAL. WE. ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE TIME TO RESOLVE THEM SO THAT RECHARGE CAN BE INCORPORATED TO GS PEAS IS NOW. WE REQUEST VOTE AYE ON AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE SO THAT IT MAY CONTINUE TO SERVE AS A CATALYST IN VEHICLE. FOR THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THANK YOU ALL ASK OF THOSE WHO WANT TO. ADD ON AS A SUPPORT TO THE MEASURE PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST CAROLING ABOUT THE TULARE COUNTY BORDER SUPERVISORS IN STRONG SUPPORT PICKING. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS CHAIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS MARYANN WARMER DAM OF THE REAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE I WOULD ALSO NOTE. THAT THIS APPROACH WILL HELP ADDRESS THE INTEGRITY OF THE AQUIFER ITSELF FOR LONG TERM ACCESS AS A RESOURCE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PACMAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY THE TWO WITNESSES SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. OKAY. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AT MANNING ON BEHALF OF THE. WATSON'S WATER DISTRICT MOJAVE WATER AGENCY. FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF ON THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WE THINK THEY GO A LONG WAY TO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE RAISED. UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL THE WAY AND WE THINK THE BILL STILL NEEDS ARE SIGNIFICANT WORK. WE. OF COURSE SUPPORT THE IDEA OF TAKING FLOOD FLOWS. ACCESS FLOWS ONE OF SURPLUS WATER AVAILABLE AND RECHARGING GROUND WATER BASINS. WETLANDS FOR EXAMPLE HAS AN OVERDRAFT GROUNDWATER BASIN BECAUSE OF LACK OF. AVAILABILITY OF IMPORTED WATER. HAVING SAID THAT WE'VE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR OVER THREE YEARS THERE WAS. TO BILL TWO BILLS BY MISS EGGMAN. OUR INCLUDING ONE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIX. AND THEN SHE DROPPED THE BILL. A SECOND BILL THAT WE WORKED ON A WORK GROUP. WITH AQUA AND OTHERS UP FOR OVER A YEAR. AND I AND AND NOW THIS BILL AND. THERE ARE TWO. BRILL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FROM THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WE THINK NEEDS FURTHER WORK AND THEIR SIGNIFICANT FOR EVERYONE IN THE STATE. FIRST THEIR TISSUES FOR IN DELTA ISSUES AND. BASICALLY. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DELTAS OF CIRCUMSTANCES OR. IN A SURPLUS CONDITION. AND THAT THERE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE CALL TERM NINETY ONE WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. ALL THE WATER SYSTEMS THAT FEED INTO THE DELTA HAVE ENOUGH WATER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES. AND THAT YOU'RE NOT TAKING WATER OUT OF THE SYSTEM. THAT IS INTENDED TO THE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR DOWNSTREAM WATER USAGE THE SECOND ISSUE IS FOR. RIVERS THAT WATER SYSTEM OUTSIDE THE DELTA. AND IN THAT RESPECT ON THIS BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN COULD AFFECT SENIOR WATER RIGHT HOLDERS NAM AND JUNIOR WATER RIGHT HOLDERS ADVERSELY. AND SO WE HAVE MET WITH THE THE AUTHOR THANK YOU ON MISTER ARAMBULA FOR MEETING WITH. ONE OF MY CLIENTS YESTERDAY TO OFFER SOME IDEAS AND SOME LANGUAGE. WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM TO TRY TO WORK THIS OUT BUT. WE WOULD BE. LESS THAN CANDID IF WE DIDN'T TELL THE COMMITTEE AND THE MEMBERS THAT THERE'S SO WE THINK THERE'S STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK TO BE DONE HERE THANK YOU. MR CARE MEMBERS AYE IF YOU INDULGE ME I'M WHITNEY WILEY WITHIN ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE LOTS A POSITION. I WANTED TO SQUEEZE THEM HAVE A TWEENER. BUT DIDN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH. AND I JUST WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT A PROCESS SO ED MENTIONED. THERE BILLS FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN SIXTEEN SIX AB SIX FORTY SEVEN AM THEM. LAST YEAR'S FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN. OCT WAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAN OF A DOCUMENT WAS ISSUED CALLED THE GROUND WATER FRAMEWORK OUT WHICH CALLED FOR AS ONE OF THE ITS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS BENEFICIAL USE UP I HAVE RECHARGE FOR BENEFICIAL USE. WE STARTED AT THAT TIME WORKING WITH OUR MEMBERS TRYING TO FIND A PATH FORWARD AND UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. AND OUT WE SPENT A ONE YEAR AT INITIALLY LOOKING FOR A WAY TO COME UP WITH LEGISLATION THAT WOULD SOLVE THIS ISSUE. AND BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE TO. GET. TOO FAR DOWN THE ROAD OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN THEN INTRODUCED SIX FORTY SEVEN OUT WE. HAD. MEMBERS THAT OPPOSE THE BILL. IN IN ENDED UP WITH SOME OF THE SITUATION THAT AB MENTION AND THEY END UP FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN SO OVER THE COURSE OF THIS LAST YEAR WE HAVE SPENT. I'M. ACCOUNTABLE HOURS TRYING TO BRING OUR MEMBERS TOGETHER TO FIND A SOLUTION AND WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE THAT. OUT IT'S NOT A LEGISLATIVE APPROACH IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPROACH I'M I'VE SHARED IT WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND WE SHARED IT WITH THE AUTHORS. OUT BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN AND AND DOCTOR ARAMBULA IT'S OFFICE WE ARE MEETING WITH THE BOARD AND BOARD STAFF NEXT WEEK ON MAY FIRST TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER TO TRY TO MOVE THIS. ISSUE FORWARD I'M NOT HERE TO ASK YOU TO VOTE NOW OR OR AYE AYE ON THE BILL BUT JUST TO LAY OUT THAT THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO BRING OUR MEMBERS IN PARTICULAR. AND THEN BRING OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ONTO THE ISSUE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING HOW JUST A SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSED TO THIS TIME AND I WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE WORK HE'S DOING ON RECOGNIZING THIS ISSUE WE DO SUPPORT FROM A RECHARGE ESPECIALLY THE WORK THAT SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION IS DOING. IS REALLY HELPFUL AND IN THE VALLEY. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. THAT THAT JOB. BENEFICIAL USES NOT BEEN SHOWN THAT THERE IT HAS THE BEEN THE THE BARRIER TO TO GETTING GROUND WATER RECHARGE PROJECTS IN PLACE ARM. AND THAT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH OPENING UP THE BENEFICIAL USE DESIGNATION AT ALL BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE SUCH SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS AND I'M I DO THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF DID. GREAT WORK TRYING TO FIND LANGUAGE THAT THAT IS MORE WORKABLE. BUT I THINK WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS APPROACH AND OUR. PARTICULAR BEEN SAYING THAT SOMEONE HAS A BENEFICIAL USE TO A PORTION OF A GROUND WATER BASE AND. WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR PRIVATIZATION OF GROUNDWATER BASIN SAYING THAT PEOPLE HAVE SPECIFIC ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PARTS OF THAT AQUIFER WHEN IN REALITY THESE ARE PUBLIC RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE USE OF SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS. OUT NGUYEN CHANGING A WATER RIGHT THE WATER BOARD TESTIFYING TO DETERMINATIONS THAT NO LEGAL USER OF WATERS INJURED OR THERE'S NO UNREASONABLE FACTS OFFICIAL WILDLIFE AND WHILE MOST OF THESE PROJECTS. WON'T HAVE THOSE ISSUES SOME CODE AND THE SEQUEL PROCESS IS HELPFUL FOR DETERMINING IMPACTS THAT CAN AFFECT THESE PEOPLE'S PROPERTY RIGHTS WAR. UP IMPACTS TO TO FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND SO WE THINK THAT THERE'S THERE COULD BE ANOTHER APPROACH FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE I AM AND WOULD BE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF LOOKING AT WAYS OF CAN WE DO THIS PERMITTING IN ADVANCE. CAN WE DETERMINE AT WHAT CONDITIONS IS IT OKAY TO PULL THIS WATER RECHARGE THIS AND SAY YOU'RE GOOD TO GO RATHER THAN SAYING. IT'S POURING WE HAVE TO HURRY RIGHT NOW. WE THINK THAT MORE WORK TO BE DONE OUT FRONT TO GET A BETTER APPROACH OVER ALL AND REALLY HELP MAKE THESE RECHARGE AREAS. HOW SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS ISSUE? THANK YOU. THANK YOU BIRD THOSE WILL POINT TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION. KATHY CHO THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ADOPT BY REFERENCE MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS MISTER MANNING AND MISS WYLIE THINKING. GOOD MORNING PUBLIC GARZA WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND ALSO IN OPPOSITION WE SUPPORT THE GOAL BUT SHARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BENEFICIAL EXCHANGE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MONICA MILLER REPRESENTING THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THANK YOU. WELL THAT WE DON'T KNOW WITHOUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA AND FORTUNE IN SUPPORT. CHRISTY FOR WITH THREE DOLLARS MISCIBLE WATER DISTRICT AND WE ARE OPPOSED FOR THE SAME REASONS OUTLINED BY THE WESTLANDS WATER. KIM DELFINO WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND WE SUPPORT THAT THE THANK YOU. IF YOU CREDIT WITH AN ARCHERY SOURCES DEFENSE COUNSEL REGRETFULLY STILL OPPOSE BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORED A RESULTS IN OUTSTANDING ISSUES THINKING. CHRIS SCOTT REPRESENT THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT WE SHARE THE OPPOSE A LOS AMENDED THAT POSITION CHAIRED BY WESTLANDS. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO. DICE QUESTIONS SIMILAR. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. YOU KNOW I DEFINITELY WITH THE CONCEPT AND YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD. TRY AND FIND A WAY ON TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS WATER FOR RECHARGE. MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS BECAUSE I KNOW. AND THIS BILL IS BEFORE US LAST. THAT LAST YEAR I THINK AS WELL. AND AND THE THE CONCERN HERE IS NOT THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE. YA BENEFICIAL USE TO TO RECHARGE JOB OFFERS AND HAVE THAT WATER BUT RATHER. WHAT'S THE IMPACT TO DEATH IN A POTENTIALLY OTHER WATER USERS AND IS THAT WATER THAT'S BEING TAKEN THAT. MIGHT OTHERWISE GO TO OTHERS AND THEN THERE'S ALSO. YOUR POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL CONCERNS AS WELL. SO. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE HAS BEEN A STAKEHOLDER GROUP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE THAT THEY'RE GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO SOMETHING THAT TO A CONCEPT THAT COULD WORK THAT WOULD ALLOW THIS. SO I GUESS MAYBE TWO PARTS IS YOU KNOW HOW. IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT YOU'RE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW ADDRESS ADDRESSES THAT MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING AND THEN. SECONDLY. WHY NOT ALLOW THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO KIND OF PHOENICIAN AND MAYBE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE BUT WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE WATER IN A WAY THAT'S FOR? GROUNDWATER RECHARGE THANK YOU AND. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND FRANKLY THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING HERE TODAY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATES TO HAVE THE SUBSTANTIVE. DISCUSSIONS BUT ALL ADDRESSED YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY IF I CAN'T. THERE'S AN URGENCY TO THIS MATTER WHICH IS THIS GOVERNOR IS LEAVING AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AND IF WE DON'T CODIFY HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER BEFORE HE LEAVES. WE'RE STARTING ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TO CONVINCE THEM OF WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT'S GOING ON. I'VE HAD SOME PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS WITH DOCTOR EGGMAN AND WOULD BE WILLING TO COLLABORATE AND WORK WITH HER. TO JOIN OUR PROCESS CITIES SO THAT WE CAN DO THIS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IT IS A DIFFICULT NEEDLE TO THREAD AND ONE THAT WILL REQUIRE A LOT OF US TO COLLABORATE AND WORK TOGETHER. I DON'T PRETEND TO HAVE THE ANSWERS AND REALLY HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND AND THE STAFF AS WELL AS WANTING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH. YOU KNOW I WAS MOVED A BIT BY WHAT A SIERRA SAID THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S POURING AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A PLANNED WELL I'M TRYING TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS NOW. SO THAT THE NEXT TIME IT'S RAINING INSTEAD OF THIS EXCESS UNUSED WATER GOING OUT TO THE OCEAN. WE HAVE THE ABILITY WE HAVE A PLAN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO THE DESIGN GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AS WE SEE FIT AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. BUT I DON'T PRETEND TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS AND REALLY AM LOOKING FOR THIS. SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE UPON. THIS BILL AND REALLY ASK THIS POLICY COMMITTEE IF I CAN TO GIVE US THAT TIME TO GIVE US. THE ENERGY TO CONTINUE THIS MOVEMENT SO THAT WE CAN GET A BILL SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR THIS YEAR. S.. THE TRAIL. IN CARE. THANK YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO OUR ATTENTION AND APOLOGIES THAT I MISSED SOME OF YOUR PRESENTATION AS I'M RUNNING AROUND BETWEEN COMMITTEES. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ADDRESS HOW YOUR BILL WOULD BE WORKED ON DURING THE DRYER YEARS FOR OUR STATE AND I ABSOLUTELY HERE. THAT THE CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS ON FIRE MENTAL ISSUES BUT. TOTALLY IN IN. AND REALLY AND ON THE WAY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT WE. HAVE TO ADDRESS AN ADDRESS CRITICALLY SO IF YOU CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. ON THE BILL IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW TO WORK DURING DRIER TIMES. REVEALED THAT CAN I GET A. MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW CAN I ANSWER THE QUESTION DIRECTLY LEFT I FEEL I'M HEARING YOU BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE I'M ADDRESSING. WELL IN TERMS OF YOUR. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AND HOW WE'RE COLLECTING GROUND WATER AND THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THAT. WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE RAIN SO WE'VE BEEN HAVING NOW. WHAT DO YOU FORESEE WOULD BE AWAY THAT THIS BILL WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED OR CAN BE HELPFUL TO THE STATE IN THE DRY YEARS I ANTICIPATE THIS BILL HAS NO EFFECT THAT? IF A SENIOR RIGHT STIFF JUNIOR RIGHTS IF ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS HAVE NOT BEEN MET THIS BILL HAS NO. USE AT ALL. IT'S ONLY IN THOSE ONCE IN A DECADE. TYPES OF SITUATIONS LIKE WE HAD LAST YEAR. WHERE THERE'S ACCESS ON USED WATER THAT'S ACTUALLY PRESENTING A HARM TO OUR STATE? THE RISK TOO DOWNSTREAM IS THE POTENTIAL FLOODING THAT CAN OCCUR WITH THAT MUCH WATER. IT'S IN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I REALLY WANT OUR STATE TOOK CRAFT A PLAN. TO HELP US TO DEAL WITH AN OVER DRAFTING PROBLEM AS WELL AS SICK. AND. IF I CAN SOAPBOX JUST FOR HALF A SECOND. WORKING IN THE ER I SAW THE EFFECT OF OUR DROUGHT ON MY COMMUNITY ON MY PEOPLE AND REALLY DO BELIEVE IT WILL TAKE% LAWS LIKE THIS DOING GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. TO HELP MY COMMUNITY TO HAVE SUSTAINABILITY AND BELIEVES THAT. HAVING SOMETHING IN PLACE FOR THOSE FUTURE WHAT YEARS WILL ALLOW OUR COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE. MY OF MISTER SALAS FOLLOWED BY THE SUPREME. THANK YOU THAT THANK YOU DOCTOR EVELYN FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD. TO STICK. YOU KNOW THE WAY I SEE THIS BILL CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO USE EXCESS WATER LIKE WE HAD. PREVIOUSLY AND ACTUALLY PUT THAT TO GOOD USE WHICH IS. I GROUND BANKING OR HELPING. HELPING MUNICIPALITY OUR WATER DISTRICTS WITH THEIR RECHARGE. AND THAT'S NOT JUST ONLY IN THE VALLEY BUT THAT'S EVEN THE CENTRAL COAST WHERE THEY HAVE THESE ISSUES. ALONG THE BORDER AND EVEN THAT. TOWARDS THE NEVADA BORDER AS WELL. SO. MY FIRST OFF IS THAT. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE AIMED AT DOING. WITH THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE ANOTHER WAS AMENDMENTS AND. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS ANY MEDIUM OR HIGH. A OVER DRAFTED. THAT GSA WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT FROM THIS IN THOSE. SITUATIONS OF HIGH PRECIPITATION. BUT IT'S ANY OVER DRAFTED OR MEDIUM OVER DRAFTED THAT. GSA THAT WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE SENATE AND THAT'LL HELP THEM MEET THEIR SINGLES THAT'S GREAT. OKAY. I SEE THIS IS A GOOD MEASURE I'LL HOME OF THE BILL. IF WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WE DO HAVE. COLLEAGUE. HI. DEFINITELY I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND IT MAKES SENSE. BUT UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH EVERYONE BECAUSE THE WATER IS FLOWING SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SOMETIMES THOSE SOMEWHERE ELSE PEOPLE. WANT ACCESS. AND MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE SEQUEL EXCEPTION. GIVEN THAT THIS COULD. DEPENDING ON WHERE THE WATER IS FLOWING AND WHERE IT'S BEING USED CONCERN ONLY IMPACT. SOME OF OUR NATURAL AREAS AND THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE WATER. IN ECO SYSTEMS THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR OCCASIONAL FLOODING. AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE WE RESTRICT THAT. THEN THAT CAN DISTURB THOSE ECO SYSTEMS AND I'M WONDERING IF HOW A AND ONE OF THE ARM. A. GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE ARM ALLUDED TO THIS IF THERE ARE WAYS OF DOING SECRET EXEMPTIONS IN ADVANCE FOR SOME OF THE MORE SENSITIVE AREAS AND AREAS THAT WE KNOW ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC FLOODING. SO THAT YOU HAVE THOSE SEQUEL OUT DOCUMENTS ARE KIND OF AT THE READY WHEN THAT TIME COMES OR EVEN THE APPROVAL STEIN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE CONSIDERED WITH YOUR AMENDMENTS. I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THINGS AS WORK GOING FORWARD BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TEMPORARY PERMITS GIVEN BY THAT STATE WATER. RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD CAN BE THAT MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT WERE SENDING WATERS TO AREAS THAT ARE MORE. ENVIRONMENTALLY READY TO RECEIVE THEM MY STRUGGLE THUS FAR GOING FORWARD HAS BEEN THAT SEQUEL BY ITS NATURE MAY PRO. THE PERIOD BEFORE WE CAN APPLY THESE WATERS AND WE MAY MISS OUR WINDOW OF HAVING ACCESS ON USED WATER RIGHT THAT'S WHY I'M WONDERING WHETHER THOSE THOSE AREN'T EVALUATIONS CAN BE DONE IN ADVANCE OF THE. FLOOD EVENT SO THAT. WHEN CERTAIN FLOODING HAPPENS IN CERTAIN AREAS YOU PRETTY MUCH KNOW I WOULD THINK BY NOW WHERE MOST OF THE WHERE A LOT OF THE WATER'S GOING WOULD HAVE GONE. AND WHERE THE FLOODING IS MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD SO MANY PAST EVENTS OF DOING THE SEQUENT ALICE'S IN ADVANCE AND LOOKING AT WHAT DIFFERENT. KIND OF TAKES OF THAT WATER ON WHAT KIND OF AN IMPACT THEY WOULD HAVE RATHER THAN TRY TO DO THEM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOD EVENT I AGREE. THOSE TEMPORARY ORDERS DID THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF SEQUEL ANALYSIS IN THEM OR WHERE THAT WAS PART OF THE ORDER TO SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO A SEQUEL ANALYSIS BECAUSE WE'RE. ARE IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY. CIRCUMSTANCE. THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT. OUR OUR PROJECT. WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A LARGE PROJECT ANY? WE WE RECEIVED A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM IDW AND WHEN I SAY WE. THE KINGS RIVER CONSERVATION DISTRICT. WE HAVE WE HAVE SPENT AND I'M GODLY AMOUNT OF TIME. DOING AGREEMENTS DOING SEEK WERE. FOR OUR PROJECT OUR PROJECT IT WAS A FLOOD WATER CORDER PROJECT THAT WE TURNED INTO A GROUND WATER RECHARGE PROJECT. IT'S BEING FUNDED TO PREVENT FLOODING DOWNSTREAM. I KNOW THAT I'VE TALKED TO OTHER GSA'S. I'M THE CHAIRMAN FOR THE GSA IN THE REGION I FARM. AND POPULAR TALK OF POSSIBLY DOING A. PAPER EITHER BASIN Y. GSA PARA SEQUEL DOCUMENT ORI GSA. SECRET DOCUMENT. SO WE DON'T HAVE THESE ISSUES BUT. I'M NOT SURE IF THE IN THE EMERGENCY OF PERMITTING IF THERE WAS IF THE QUOTE WAS PART OF THAT ITEM. THAT'S NOT IT TO. FIGHT THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS SEEK THERE WAS AN EXEMPTION FROM SEQUEL SO WHERE DID THOSE THOSE TWO. PA TEMPORARY RIGHTS PERMITS THAT WERE GRANTED SO FAR AT LEAST UNDER THAT PROVISION BOTH WERE. EXEMPTED FROM SEQUEL. US SO THAT'S BUT THAT'S THE WAY THAT IT CURRENTLY STANDS IN THE LANGUAGE. BUT LIKE I SAID BEFORE HIGH I MEAN OUR ORGANIZATION AT LEAST BELIEVES THAT THAT. WE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S OUR CONCERNS SO WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE THESE PROJECTS GO FORWARD DE PUT TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT BUT. SOME KIND OF A PROGRAMMATIC DOCUMENT OR SOME OTHER APPROACH TO SEEK WITH THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE SUGGESTING. TERMS OF CREATE ADVANCE ANALYSIS SO THAT. WHEN THE ACTUAL OF EVENTS OCCUR YOU CAN JUST MOVE ON THE THAT WOULD BE MY STRONG SUGGESTION BECAUSE I'M NOT COMFORTABLE. A VOTING ON DOING. SEQUEL EXEMPTION SORT OF A QUID UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE BOARD IN MANY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE PEOPLE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE DONE THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS IN THE PAST. AND IT SEEMS REASONABLE. GIVEN THE HIGH PROPENSITY FOR FLOODING IN CERTAIN AREAS WHICH MANY WILL BE KNOWN. SO YOU COULD DO THOSE SORTS OF PROGRAMMATIC HERE OURS IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT I INTEND TO. MAKE THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW. THEY'LL THEMSELVES OF THE LEGISLATION SO THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION AND I'M HAPPY TO CONSIDER. ANY POTENTIAL THINGS AS WE GO FORWARD. OUR ATTEMPT WAS REALLY TO PROVIDE AN URGENCY TO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND TO TRY TO CODIFY. AND SO WE STARTED WITH WHAT HE HAD DONE RIGHT TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION BUT I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE AS I WAS PROCESS CONTINUES RIGHT I UNDERSTAND I MEAN HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY AND HE WAS RESPONDING BUT WE'RE NOT THE MIDDLE OF EMERGENCY NOW SO WE. HAVE TIME TO ASK THE AGENCIES TO START DOING SOME OF THIS WORK GOING FORWARD I WOULD THINK. SO I THINK THAT YOU WOULD GET A LOT MORE SUPPORT FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY IF THAT IF AT LEAST THAT SAFETY MEASURE. WAS ANTICIPATED AND HAVE PUT INTO PLACE. IN ADVANCE SO. I WILL SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT YOU KNOW IS I SEE I I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND CERTAINLY THE DOWN HOLD. WATER WATER RATES YOU KNOW AND THEIR CONCERNS AND I. JUST WANTED TO PUT IT IN YOUR BRAIN THAT THIS WAS MY PARTICULAR CONCERN AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO A VOTE ON THE FLOOR I'LL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT WORK WAS DONE IN THIS AREA. THINK IT THANK YOU THINKING WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM MISTER BIGELOW FOLLOWED BY MISTER AGAINST YOU. THANK YOU. TO THE AUTHOR. WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT LAST YEAR NGUYEN NON. IT'S FORTY SEVEN BILL WENT FORWARD. I ACTUALLY TOOK A POSITION OF OF A NOT VOTING ON THAT. TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE ON WITHOUT WEIGHING AND WITH YASSER NOW. ONE OF THAT. GOOD PARTS OF HER BILL WHICH IS THE PART THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN IN YOUR BILL AT THIS. TIME WAS THE ABILITY TO PROTECT. THE DOWNSTREAM USERS AND THE WATER RIGHTS. OF FOLKS WHO WERE. ESSENTIALLY PROTECTED. ARE YOU HAVING HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY YOU SPOKE DIRECTLY ABOUT. THE FLOOD FLOWS. AND SO THERE'S A DISTINGUISHING COMPONENT BETWEEN PROTECTING THE SENIOR WATER RIGHTS IN THE JUNIOR WATER RIGHTS AND THE FOLKS. WHO WERE BASICALLY TRYING TO UTILIZE? NOT APPROPRIATE NOT. RECEIVE OUR ADJUDICATE ANYWAY BUT TO UTILIZE FLOOD FLOOD WATERS. IS YOUR BILL SINGULAR. IN THAT IS ONLY TALKING TO. THE. FLOOD FLOWS. AND WOULD YOUR BILL AND AS IT MOVES FORWARD WOULD YOU BE AGREEABLE TO OUTLINING PROTECTION. SPECIFIC FOR THOSE SENIOR AND JUNIOR WATER RIGHT HOLDERS. YES. SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO COLLABORATE AND WORK FORWARD BOTH TO INSURE THAT SENIOR AND JUNIOR WATER RIGHTS. ARE PROTECTED AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS. I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH DOWNSTREAM USERS TO GIVE THEM CONFIDENCE AND WHAT ARE BILL IS TRYING TO ASPIRE TO. BUT I JUST. I FEEL LIKE I GOT TO KEEP PUSHING I DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS WINDOW WITH THIS GOVERNOR ON HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND AM HAPPY TO COLLABORATE WITH DR EGGMAN TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TOGETHER MOVING. FORWARD AND MAY BE INCORPORATING THE PORT PARTS OF HER BILL I'M AND WOULD ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE ON THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO GIVE INPUT BECAUSE. THIS IS. THAT SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO FOR STATE. GIVEN THAT SAID I'M I'M ENCOURAGED ARE ALSO. WOULD MISS EGGMAN SPELL. IT AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A NUMBER OF COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS BY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TOGETHER OVER THE. THE SPIRITED TIME TO PUT TOGETHER AND WE HEARD THIS EARLIER. TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS TO TRY TO BRING. BILL FORD. UNFORTUNATELY IT HASN'T MATERIALIZED AS YET. BUT THERE ARE SOME KEY POINTS THAT THEY HAVE. THAT MAYBE YOU WOULD WANT TO ENTERTAIN IF THEY COULD RAPIDLY PUT THOSE COMPONENTS TOGETHER. IN THIS BILL AND MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE COMPREHENSIVE. TO ADDRESS. THE OVERALL BROADNESS IN SCOPE. OF YOUR BILL WOULD YOU BE ENCOURAGED TO MAYBE LOOK AT THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT ANY POTENTIAL BUT IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO WORK THROUGH MISTER CHAIR AND THAT COMMITTEE. ABSOLUTELY AND SUCH THAT. CHANGING ONE WORD MAY HAVE DETRIMENTAL AFFECT WE ALL UNDERSTAND PHILLIP SO WOULD LIKE IF POSSIBLE TO WORK THROUGH YOU TO. ENSURE THAT THE VISION ON THE STILL BEING A. AN UNDERSTANDING THAT. THIS BILL IS REALLY ONLY DEALING WITH AREAS OF THE STATE. WHERE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY? FOR CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS TO DIRECT AND CHANNEL THE WATERS. IT ISN'T GOING TO FACILITATE. THE OVERALL NEED FOR ALL OF THE. OVERDRAFT THAT'S OCCURRING. AREAS THAT. DON'T HAVE SURFACE WATER COMPONENTS AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. AREAS THAT ARE BEING FARM TODAY OR UTILIZED. AND THEY'RE BEING OVER DRAFTED WITH NO ABILITY TO RECHARGE. WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY STILL AFFORD THEM WHEN THERE ARE FLOOD WATERS. FROM FLOOD. CHANNELS THAT MAY EXIST NATURALLY. TO BE UTILIZED. DO YOU SEE THAT IN YOUR BILL. A MY UNDERSTANDING IS IN THOSE HIGH PRECIPITATION YEARS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO ON A FARM RECHARGE TO DO RECHARGE BASINS OR TO DO. INJECTION WELLS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO USE THESE FLOOD FLOWS TO. A FILL ARE DEPLETED AQUIFER'S RIGHT. AND I'M NOT STE CERTAINLY OH ALWAYS INCREASE BY INJECTION WAS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS TO ME ON THE FILTRATION? OF THE WATER GOING DOWN I KIND OF FIND MYSELF MORE ENCOURAGED BY THE NATURAL. OF FLOW OF WATER TO. PERCOLATE THROUGH THE GROUND AND THE FILTRATION SYSTEM IN A MORE NATURAL BALLISTIC Y.. BECAUSE OBJECTION TIME TO GET SHOULD. FARTHER DOWN QUICKER. WITH ALL THE SAME CONTAMINANTS THAT MAY EXIST OR MAY NOT EXIST. BUT I'M COURAGE BY YOUR WORDS AND THOUGHTS HERE TODAY I SEE ABA PERSON WANTS TO RESPOND. RIGHT MISTER BIGELOW. HAVE CHAIR OF THE GFA THAT THE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO SURFACE WATER DELIVERIES. WE ARE IN IT AT EXTREME LEE BAD SITUATION. OF WITH SIGMA. UP THE AREAS THAT ARE IN OUR THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS HAVE NO INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER HAD THE WATER. TO CONVEY. WE'VE WE PUT IN FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT GRANTS. AND WE GET REJECTED BECAUSE. GRETA RECHARGE IS NOT BENEFICIAL USE. SO THAT THE REAL PROBLEM AND. AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. NO THE PUT OUT WITHOUT TELEGRAM WATER RECHARGE BEING BENEFICIAL USE. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO GET REJECTIONS. FOR THAT CONVEYANCE THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE TO COME AND COMPLIANCE WITH SIGMA. SO. THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH. THANK YOU FOR THE. ION. UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR DISTRICT BUT LET ME BEG THE QUESTION. HOW DO YOU RECHARGE WHERE YOU HAVE NO ABILITY TO CAPTURE A CHANNELER MOVE OTHER THAN RAINFALL AND THAT'S A NATURAL OCCURRENCE KNOW IF IF YOU HAVE NO? SOURCE OF WATER IF YOU'RE NOT NEAR RIVER. YOU'RE RIGHT YEAH YOU'RE ONLY. THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA BE COMPLYING IS TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE RECHARGE FOR YOU IN AN ADJACENT GSA. OR GONNA HAVE TO IDLE GROUND CUT OKAY AND AND THAT DILUTES JOBS YOU LOSE A COMMUNITY ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT AND THAT HAPPENS. A GREAT DEAL THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY RIGHT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF POCKETS THAT OUR NEIGHBORS TO BUT THERE COMES A DEPRESSIONS. ARE LINKED TOGETHER. BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE FILLED BEFORE YOU CAN FILL THE OTHER. AND THAT BECOMES THE SCENARIO OF EITHER SUCCESS OR FAILURE. SO I APPLAUD WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I AM ENCOURAGED BY WHAT MISTER ARAMBULA IS. TRYING TO DO HERE. TODAY THERE'S JUST A NUMBER OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS BEFORE. SUPPORTED AND AND. BUT I WANT TO HELP IT AND I WANT THE ENCOURAGE I AM COURAGE BY HIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE. AND WORK WITH SOME AMENDMENTS TO OUTLINE THOSE PROTECTIONS OF THE WATER RIGHT HOLDERS. AND AND WORK WITH SOME OF THE OTHER COMPONENTS AS I'VE DISCUSSED. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU. SOME MEMBER CHIU. ALRIGHT THANK YOU ARE DOCTOR RAMBLER. VERY QUICKLY I I'M VERY. ENCOURAGED BY YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH HER OPPOSITION ON THE WATER RIGHT ISSUE AS WELL. AS THE. OF AN ADVANCE PERMITTING THE USE OF THEM IDEA SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MATHIS. I WANT TO START BY SAYING YOU AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS OVER THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I REALLY TRULY DO APPRECIATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN YOU AND I AND WITH OUR OFFICES. I DO LIKE THE DIRECTION THIS IS HEADING. I SHARE A LOT OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS MISTER BIGELOW. WITH OUR. SENIOR WATER RIGHTS FIRST JUNIOR WATER RIGHTS AND EVERYTHING GOING ON BUT WE MUST MOVE FORWARD AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE CONVEYANCE. TO GET THE RECHARGE. ARE. I I KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT OBJECTION WHILE SO I DO APPRECIATE THE THE ABILITIES THEIR. QUITE FRANKLY IT'S BEYOND ME WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT DOING WETLANDS WITH INJECTION WELLS WITH THEN. SO WE HAVE HABITAT AS WELL AS GROUND WATER RECHARGE AS A PRIORITY. ON AND LOOK AT IT AS A HOLISTIC VIEW SO BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS ARE MAD AS WELL AS. ON THE BACK END OF SIGMA WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS GETTING WATER. BACK INTO THE AQUIFER. THAT THE NATURAL WAY IS GREAT BUT IT DOESN'T BREAK THROUGH THE CLAY LAYERS IN OUR STRADDLE. ON THE INJECTION IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT. I'M ENCOURAGED. I WILL BE WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS I KNOW WE HARDLY HAD THE DISCUSSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT AMENDMENTS IN THE FUTURE SO ON. FOR FOR OTHER MEMBERS ON THE DIETS THAT ARE ON THE FENCE I SUGGEST THE INWARD REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS JOIN IN THE DISCUSSION MOVING THIS FORWARD. HE WAS MATHIS. DR NUMBER LED THE MEASURE DOES. I HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED. DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND BY MISTER SALAS AND MISS CARILLO CHUCK CLOSE. YEAH.

THAT DAY. THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT ON AB THIRTY TWO EIGHTEEN AND LET ME START BY SAYING THAT ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY. TO DEVELOP AND MANAGE THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER PARKWAY. THE VISION OF THE CONSERVANCY AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM COSTA WAS TO CREATE A TWENTY TWO MILE NATURAL AND RECREATIONAL AREA. IN THE FLOOD PLAIN EXTENDING FROM THE FRAMES DAM TO HIGHWAY NINETY NINE. FOR THE LAST TWENTY SIX YEARS THE CONSERVANCY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES A FRESNO MADERA. AND MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE STATE HAVE WORKED HARD TO ACQUIRE AN INTERN TO PARTNERSHIPS TO MAKE THE PARKWAY A REALITY. HOWEVER MUCH WORK NEEDS YET REMAINS IN ORDER TO FULLY OPERATE AND MANAGE THE PARKWAY. IT IS NO SECRET THIS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IS SEVERELY UNDERSERVED AND FALLS FAR BEHIND THE IN THE RATE OF PARKS PER CAPITA. THIS LACK OF GREEN SPACE AFFECTS MEMBERS OF OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE MOST. AS A PHYSICIAN I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF SPENDING TIME OUTDOORS. DIABETES HYPERTENSION OBESITY THESE COULD ALL BE ALLEVIATED BY SIMPLY SPENDING MORE TIME OUTDOORS IF ONLY WE COULD PROVIDE A SAFE AND AVAILABLE RECREATIONAL AREA FOR ALL TO ENJOY. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL WOULD ACCOMPLISH. AB THIRTY TWO EIGHTEEN WOULD ALLOW THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY THE ABILITY TO ENTER INTO A MANAGEMENT AGREEMET WITH THE STATE PARKS THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. OF THE TRAILS AND SPACE THAT THE PARKWAY HAS ACQUIRED. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU THIS BILL THAT IS ONE SUPPORT OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER TRUST THE COUNTY OF FRESNO THE COUNTY OF MADERA THE CITY OF FRESNO. THE OFFICIALS FROM THE CITY OF MADERA AND MANY OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS AND LEADERS. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS SHARON WEAVER THEEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. TRUST. GOOD MORNING. I'D LIKE TO START BY READING A SHORT QUOTE FROM A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE THAT WAS AUTHORED BY A JOURNALISM PROFESSOR AND REPORTER NAMED ROGER TO TERRY AND BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BEFORE THE PARKWAY EFFORT WAS REALLY UNDER WAY. AND THERE'S A PARAGRAPH HERE WHERE HE WRITES. IT IS A MUCH EXPLOITED STREAM THIS RIVER OF OURS IT IS HARNESSED AND RE HARNESS FOR HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT AS IT COURSES THROUGH THE SIERRA. AND AT FREIEN THIS DAMNED FOR THE BENEFIT OF AGRICULTURE. IF THOSE PROJECTS HAVE PROVIDED RECREATIONAL FACILITIES FOR THE PUBLIC AT LARGE THEY HAVE DONE SO ONLY A SIDE EFFECTS. THIS TIME LET THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO SHARED DIRECTLY IN A GREAT NATURAL RESOURCE BE THE PRIMARY MOTIVE. I AM SO PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SIT HERE WITH DOCTOR ARAMBULA TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. I'VE SPENT ALMOST TWENTY YEARS WORKING FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER PARKWAY AND CONSERVATION TRUST. AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE GOALS IN OUR CREATION OF THE PARKWAY THOSE GOALS ARE LAND CONSERVATION. EDUCATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND ALSO OFFERING RECREATIONAL ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY. NOW OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE WORKED COOPERATIVELY WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE PARKS AND OTHER OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES TO ACQUIRE ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND ACRES. FOR PUBLIC ACCESS AND ENJOYMENT ALONG THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. BUT DURING THAT SAME TIME FRAME I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE LOTS OF PEOPLE ON GUIDED WALKS AND GUIDED TOURS OF THE RIVER. BUT THE QUESTION THAT I ALWAYS RECEIVE IS CAN I COME BACK HERE ON MY OWN. IS THIS PROPERTY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND IT'S BECOMING HARDER AND HARDER AFTER ALMOST THIRTY YEARS OF EFFORT ON THE PARKWAY. TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE THAT KNOW TECHNICALLY THIS LAND IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR YOUR PUBLIC USE AND LESS YOU ARE ON A GUIDED TOUR. OR ON A FIELD TRIP LED BY MY ORGANIZATION OR ONE OF OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS BILL WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IT'S THE RIGHT MEASURE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND I AM PLEASED TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF IT. THANK YOU THAT ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN. SUPPORT MAYBE THIRTY TWO EIGHTEEN. KAREN LANG ON GOV OF THE FRESNO AND MADERA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WITH THE AMENDMENTS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSES IN THE DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHOR. THEY'RE VERY HAPPY TO MOVE TO SUPPORT POSITION TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. BUT AFRICAN VOLATILE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. SEEN ANYONE ELSE. TO HAVE ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW ONE. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE OR THE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE OP. XENON. LESS TIME. JUST. I APPRECIATE THE OFFER EFFORTS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THE S. AND I KNOW THINGS AND FRESNO CAN GET QUITE CONTROVERSIAL AT TIMES. AND AND BEING SOMEBODY WHO YOU WHAT COLLEGE AT FRESNO STATE AND GOT TO ENJOY THIS AREA FOR SOME TIME. I AM IT'S NICE TO SEE THIS MOVING FORWARD AND YOU WORKING WITH THE LOCALS TO. GET EVERYTHING WORKED OUT SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING TODAY THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THIS. THANK YOU APPROACH BIGELOW. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR. AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED A NUMBER OF FOLKS HAVE WORKED ON IT. IN THE LAST. COUPLE OF DAYS. LATE OUR WORK AND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS. I DO WANNA. TRITA DEEP CLEAR. THIS ISN'T CREATING A NEW STATE PARK. IS JUST CREATING A MANAGEMENT TOOL. BY WHICH THE THE LOCAL AGENCY THAT'S BEEN CREATED THE SAN JOAQUIN. A RIVER CONSERVANCY WILL. WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH STE. STATE PARKS TO MANAGE AND FACILITATE THE CONSTRUCTION ANNA ON HIM IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING. OUR INTENT WAS TO WORK THROUGH THE COMMITTEE AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN RETURN A PARK IN ANY. FASHION WE COULDN'T HONESTLY I WAS QUITE PLEASED WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND HOW IT HAS BEEN ABLE TO. BRING EVERYONE INTO A SUPPORT POSITION AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. IN THAT WAY AND AND AS THIS MOVES FORWARD THE REQUEST OF THE BILL REALLY. IT KIND OF. IT IT GETS US TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE CAN TALK. BUT THE REAL TALK REALLY REVOLVES AROUND MONEY. AND THIS IS HOLLOW AT THIS MOMENT IT HAS NO MONEY. AND IT HAS NO. OUR ABILITY TO PUT THE TOOLS TOGETHER UNTIL WE GET FUNDING. AND SO THAT'S GONNA BE THE ART OF THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD. WHERE'S THE FUNDING GONNA COME FROM. WHILE I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND WHEN ENCOURAGE EVERY MEMBER AROUND THIS TABLE. DISAPPOINTED. I WOULD ALSO ASK EVERY MEMBER TO STAND IN OPPOSITION IF IT'S GONNA TAKE A DIME. OUT OF OUR EXISTING STATE PARKS BUDGET. ANDERSON BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR US TO BE. WE NEED TO FIND NEW FUNDING. AND I THINK THAT'S FUNDING THAT'S CLEAN FUNDING THAT DOESN'T GET TAKEN FROM ANY OTHER SOURCES. TO HELP FACILITATE MAKING THIS HAPPEN. WITH THAT SAID. SURE I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE STAFF. TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON TRYING TO FIND THE TOOLS HE NEEDS TO TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND FOR THE PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THIS IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER CHALLENGE. THE CHALLENGE BETWEEN TWO COUNTIES. AND AND A CITY WHO HAS GOVERNANCE CONTROLS. OVER THE LAND WITHIN THE PARKWAY. THERE ARE CERTAIN TOOLS THAT PRECLUDE THEM. IN PARTICULAR IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AGREEMENT THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO DEVELOP. THE PARKWAY FULLY UNTIL EVERY ACRE. ENVISIONED IS PURCHASED. IT'S THE FIFTY NINE HUNDRED ACRE TOTAL. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE THAT THAT. COMPONENT IS REMOVED AS A BARRIER. AND ALLOW THE PEOPLE. IN THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE ABILITY TO NOW CONSTRUCT. AN OPEN. THE DOOR FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT NEUTRALIZE IT. I KNOW MISS WEAVER. A NO IS IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR. SINCE. THE EARLY DAYS IN INTO. EARLY EARLY NINETIES. THAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS BEGAN. SO I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THOSE LOCALS TO GO BACK AND REVIEW THOSE POLICIES. AND WORK FORWARD. IN DEVELOPING A MEANINGFUL TRAIL EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE QUITE HONESTLY STANDING FROM ONE TO THREE MILES AWAY. TAKING YOUR LITTLE CHILD AND SAYING A LOOK OVER THERE IS THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. ISN'T A NIGHT MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE. WILLIAM GO DOWN HERE THE WATER. TOUCH THE WATER. AND LOOK AT THE WONDERS THAT EXIST ALONG THIS PARKWAY. WOULD BE A MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE. AND I COMPLIMENT BOTH THE PARKWAY TRUST AND THE CONSERVANCY BUT EFFORTS THAT THEY'VE DONE TO THIS POINT. BUT I ALSO WANT TO CHALLENGE HIM TO SUCCEED EVEN MORE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THEY GIVE US BIGELOW FOR THAT DATA VISUALIZATION OF THAT WALK IN. THIS PART OF. TO ME. IT'S GOOD. WOULD LIKE CLOSE. IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY TOO AND NOT TO DATE MYSELF BUT ACTION WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL BACK THEN AND. DOT BEFORE MY KIDS ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL I HOPE WE CAN COMPLETE THIS PROJECT. AND IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR THOSE IN MY COMMUNITY WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. NATURAL HABITATS AS ARE AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO REALIZE WHAT'S IN OUR BACKYARD SO WITH THAT I HUMBLY ASK FOR YOUR HOME I WILL CALL THE QUESTION TO THE MOTION MADE BY MS PREMIUMS RUBIO. TO PASS WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO APPROPRIATIONS WELCOME. THE MOTION ASTUTE PASSES AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS EDUARDO GARCIA GARCIA AYE. GALLAGHER BY GALLAGHER AYE BIGELOW. HELLO I CARILLO. CARILLO AYE CHOI AYE CHOI AYE CHU. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN HIGH GLORIA. HARPER AYE HARPER AYE KALRA. LEVINE MATHIS AYE MATHIS AYE RUBIO AYE REVEAL AYE SOLACE. SOLACE I WOULD. WE WILL KEEP HERE CALL OPEN ON THAT ITEM AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS ONE FOR THE MEMBERS AT OCT THANK YOU MAKE YOU. WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM FIVE AB TWENTY THREE FORTY EIGHT WAS AGUIAR-CURRY. VIA. AB TWENTY FORTY EIGHT AS THE. DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. PROJECTS SURE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY THREE FORTY EIGHT WILL HELP OFFSET THE COST OF WINTER FLOODING RICE FIELDS AN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICE THE PROVIDES CRITICAL WETLAND HABITAT. AND FOOD FOR ROUGHLY SIX MILLION BIRDS IN CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY AS WATER RATES HAVE INCREASED IN THE AN ALTERNATE LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN WE MERGED. RICE GROWERS ARE LESS ABLE TO CONTINUE WINTER FLOODING THEIR FIELDS. THIS SHIFT IN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THREATENING WETLAND HABITAT AVAILABILITY AND THE WILDLIFE THEY RELY ON THIS HABITAT FOR FOOD. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY ESTIMATES THAT PURCHASING PROTECTING AND ENHANCING JUST A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF WETLAND HABITAT ACROSS THE STATE UP TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS. ON THE AND OTHER HAND HELPING FARMERS PAY TO MAINTAIN THE AGRICULTURAL WETLANDS THEY PROVIDE IS A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE. WELL THIS BILL PER IMPROVES WETLAND HABITAT FOR BIRDS. IT ALSO IMPROVES HABITAT FOR OTHER SPECIES LIKE SAMMONS AND SALMON AND SNAKES. FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT A REPRESENT US FOR THE CALIFORNIA RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THE ART OF ON CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHARACTERIZED MY MAY CONSERVATION PROJECT MANAGER AT ALL OF ON CALIFORNIA WHERE I WORK TO PROVIDE HABITAT FOR. MIGRATORY BIRDS ON THE FARM FIELDS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I THINK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THIS TIME TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE FORTY EIGHT I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL FOR INTRODUCING THIS INNOVATIVE. AND FORWARD THINKING PIECE OF LEGISLATION. FOR MANY YEARS ON CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY GROUPS CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS FARMERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE. HABITAT FOR MIGRATORY BIRDS ON THE WORKING LANDS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE NATURAL WETLAND HABITAT IS A FRACTION OF WHAT IT USED TO BE HISTORICALLY. AND IN THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE RICE PRODUCTION PROVIDES UP TO EIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL OF THE AVAILABLE FLOODED HABITAT DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. CONSEQUENTLY RICE PRODUCTION PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN PROVIDING HABITAT FOR WATER BIRDS AND OTHER SPECIES THAT ARE RELYING UPON WHAT HABITATS. IN CALIFORNIA RICE PRODUCTION SUPPORTS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY DIFFERENT WILDLIFE SPECIES INCLUDING OVER FIFTY DIFFERENT SPECIES OF WATER BIRDS. AND IN WINTER RICE FIELDS FLOODED IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY HOST NEARLY THIRTY PERCENT OF THE REASON SHOREBIRDS. AND TWO THIRDS OF THE WATERFALL MIGRATING AND THE PACIFIC FLYWAY WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT OF NORTH AMERICA'S DUCKS. THE RACE COMMISSION AND RICE FARMERS HAVE BEEN DEDICATED TO THE CONSERVATION OF WATER BIRDS AND HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY WITH AUDUBON AND OTHER CONSERVATION PARTNERS. TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE WAYS OF ENHANCING THEIR FIELDS FOR BIRDS. AND THERE ARE A FEW OTHER EXAMPLES OF SUCH A RICH AND PRODUCTIVE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL AND CONSERVATION GROUPS. AB TWENTY THREE FORTY EIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO ADD TO OUR CONSERVATION TOOLBOX FOR SUSTAINING WATER POPULATIONS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT RICE FLOODING IS NOT A COMPLETE SUBSTITUTE FOR WETLAND HABITAT HOWEVER IT IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDING PLACES TO REST AND FEED. FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WATER BIRDS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IN A VOTES ON AB TWENTY THREE FORTY EIGHT. THANK YOU. YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. HOW ARE A CONSERVATION PARTNERS CAN SAY IT ANY BETTER HOW WE HAVE ENJOYED A GREAT PARTNERSHIP? IN THE RICE INDUSTRY OF CREATING THESE WETLANDS ARE IN THE WINTER. THE TRUTH MATTER IS A IT'S NOT AN INEXPENSIVE PRACTICE. AND DEPENDING ON A WATER RATES ON ANY GIVEN YEAR WATER AVAILABILITY ETCETERA AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THAT ALLOW FOR THE SAME END FARMING PRACTICE TO OCCUR WITHOUT WINNER FLOODING WERE. CONCERNED. AND THAT IN THE FUTURE RICE FARMERS MAY NOT BE AS OPEN TO THE ABILITY OF OF WINTER FLOODING WITHOUT SOME INCENTIVES. AND SO THIS BILL COMES FORWARD IT AT A VERY OPPORTUNE TIME. I IN HELPING TO CREATE THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM HOW WITH THE OF AVAILABILITY AND POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE BOND MONIES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND ALSO WORK THAT THE RICE COMMISSION IN OUR. CONSERVATION PARTNERS ARE DOING IN WASHINGTON DC HOW ON THE FEDERAL FARM BILL AYE WE BELIEVE THAT A PROGRAM OF THIS NATURE THAT COULD HOUSE SOME OF THAT MONEY WOULD HELP THEN PROVIDE THE INCENTIVES NECESSARY TO KEEP. OUR THOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES AVAILABLE FOR BIRDS FOR OTHER A MIGRATORY WATERFOWL. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THAT THOSE WISHING TO ADD ON. IN SUPPORT. SEC. Q. MOTION THE SECOND. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARIAN WARMER DOWN WITH RURAL COUNTIES WE ARE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE WOULD ALSO NOTE THIS IS A. VERY CREATIVE WAY OF RETAINING AND GROWING THE ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY WHILE STILL KEEPING THOSE PROPERTIES ON THE PRIVATE TAX RULES WHICH IS IMPORTANT AS A LOCAL REVENUE STREAM FOR COUNTIES THANK YOU. ARGUMENT WITH DUCKS UNLIMITED WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH OUR SCIENCE THAT. WHAT'S GOOD FOR DUCKS GOOD FOR RICE WHAT'S GOOD FOR RICE GOOD FOR DUCKS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ELENA ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LUCAS FRERICHS AB HAVE THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN STRONG SUPPORT THANKS VERY MUCH. LAUGHTER AIR GOOD MORNING PUBLIC OURS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND IN SUPPORT. OKAY ZERO ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. WELL I. JOE FULBERT WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION WE DO NOT ACTUALLY OPPOSED THE BILL. WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT. AT WINTER FLOODED RICE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. TO OUR WATER FILE. AND THAT WE IN TWOS YES STICKLEY SUPPORTED. AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO LAST YEAR. OUR REAL CONCERN THOUGH IS WITH USE OF THE. THE FUNDING OR THE ACCOUNT. THAT IS BEING USED TO CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL HABITAT PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS PROSYD PROGRAM. A CALIFORNIA WATER FILES. SPONSORED THAT BILL THIRTY YEARS AGO. AND IT HAS. EIGHT A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT OVER THE YEARS TO TRY TO KEEP IT FUNDED. A WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS ONE IS THAT. THE. PURPOSE OF THE PRESLEY PROGRAM IS TO. UP PROMOTE NATURAL. ENVIRONMENTS FOR THE DUCKS. AND. TO PROMOTE JUDGE SPRINGTIME. NESTING HABITAT AND SUMMERTIME OF FOOD GROWTH FOR THAT THE DOCKS OUTSIDE IT EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS. THE USE OF AGRICULTURE OR THAT PLANNING THAT CULTURAL CROPS ON THE PROPERTIES. OF THE OTHER PROBLEM WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF WINDING UP COMPETING FOR FUNDS. WITH THE RICE INDUSTRY. I WE WOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO SEE AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR WINTER FLOODED RICE. IF THERE WAS A WAY IS A WAY TO PUT A VERY STRONG FIRE WALL IN THIS ACCOUNT. THAT WOULD SEPARATE THE. THE CURRENT PROGRAM FROM A WINNER RISE. THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE SOLUTION. OF THE OTHER WOULD BE TO SEEK ANOTHER. ACCOUNT CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT AND. FUNDED SEPARATELY. AGAIN THE YOU KNOW IT IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WE COULD. STRONGLY SUPPORT AND WE VERY RELUCTANTLY. EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS HERE. WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO. ACHIEVE A. SUCCESS FOR EVERYBODY ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. KIM DELFINO WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION OF OPPOSING THE BELT BUT YOU'RE A COMEDIAN NOW ASSISTED RATES OF AND AND JUST LET ME JUST SAY FIRST FOR THE RECORD WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM AND. ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE THE CONCEPT. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FLAG ONE ISSUE WHICH IS. CURRENTLY THE WELL THE WAY THE BILL'S DRAFTED IS THAT IT WOULD ALLOW FOR LANCE TACTIC CHARACTERIZES LANDS THAT IT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING WOULD BE LAND THAT INFALLIBLE. THAT'S MEANING NOT PLANTED THAT YEAR WHEN IT'S THAN BEING FLOODED UP THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THAT. THESE DOLLARS ARE VERY SCARCE WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE DOLLARS LANDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PLANTED IN THAT HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED AND THEN FLOODED. REALLY PROVIDE VERY LITTLE HABITAT VALUE IT IS THE VALUE OF THE RICE THAT HAD BEEN PLANTED THERE. THAT REALLY PROVIDES AND THEN THAT WHATEVER'S LEFT OVER THEN FLOODED OUT THAT PROVIDES THE REAL FOOD VALUE. AND SO WE WOULD JUST URGE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THROUGH AND MASSAGING THIS BILL THAT THE AUTHOR CONSIDER MAKING. THIS AMENDMENT. IN THE PROCESS OF THINK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. XENA AND NO ONE ELSE'S. SPEAK IN OPPOSITION WOULD YOU LIKE TO AYE. WE ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS ARE FOR. CHAIRMAN LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION HAD TO ADDRESS JUST A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES OUT FIRST I IN. IN REGARDS TO THE PRESLEY PROGRAM WE FIND THAT TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM. AND EVER AGREED WITH THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION AND WANTING TO DIVIDE DIVINE. DRAFTING LANGUAGE THAT CREATES THAT SOUND FOR FIREWALL. BETWEEN. THAT THE FUNDING FOR NATURAL WETLANDS IN ANN RICE WETLANDS. BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT THOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT I'M WITH THE RICE INDUSTRY AND OTHERS IN IN CONSERVATION THAT SUPPORT WINNER FLOODED RICE. THAT THE MORE OF US ASKING FOR MONIES FOR THESE PROGRAMS PROBABLY THE BETTER FOR THE PROGRAM IN THE LONG RUN. AND UTILIZING THE THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HIGH AS WELL AS IN IN OTHER AIR AREAS TO GET FUNDING THAT WE BELIEVE THAT ULTIMATELY WE CAN ENHANCE THE PRESLEY PROGRAM OVERALL WITH SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FUNDING. ON THE ISSUE OF THE FALLOW GROUNDS THE REASON WE'VE ADDED THIS IN HERE IS FOR BOMB OUR FARMERS IN THE INDUSTRY THAT GROW ORGANIC RICE. I THEY HAVE A CROP ROTATION IN ABOUT EVERY THIRD YEAR THEY LEAVE THEIR PROPERTY FALLOW FOR THE PER THAT FOR THOSE PURPOSES OF GROWING ORGANIC RICE TO REGENERATE THE SOIL. AND SO WE DID NOT WANT TO ELIMINATE THEM FROM THE OPPORTUNITY WE KNOW THAT THAT. THAT'S THOSE FIELDS THAT DON'T HAVE A CURRENT OUTCROP OF RICE ON IT ARE NOT AS BENEFICIAL TO THE WATERFOWL. BUT AGAIN WE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE OUR. FARMERS OUT THERE THAT ARE GROWING ORGANIC RICE OUT OF THIS PROGRAM SO THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THAT WE'VE ALLOWED FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. IF YOU. THE QUESTIONS FROM ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THERE'S A MOTION A SECOND BY MEANS FRIEDMAN. AND MAY HAVE MISSED GALLAGHER. LIKE CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE AYE VOTE RIGHT THIS IS A DO PASSED TO SIMPLY APPROPRIATIONS. IS KALRA. MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. EDUARDO GARCIA.

THERE ARE YOU READY YEAH BILL. MAINLY BY LIKE. ONE OF MY. MOVE THE BILL. THIS GALLERY OF TWO BILLS THAT. OR THREE THREE. I I THINK IT UP A HEAD OF TEN AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN. HE BEAT THIRTY FORTY FIVE. OF START WITH THE TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE. IT THAT YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE HELPS ENSURE THAT THERE'S CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE APPLICATION ENFORCEMENT. OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE LAKE AND STREAM BED ALTERATION PROGRAM. AND I DO ONE OF STATE TO BEGIN I AM TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. WHICH I THINK HELPS CLARIFY THAT THIS WOULD INCLUDE WILDLIFE AND NOT JUST AQUATIC. THAT NOT JUST AQUATIC SPECIES. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES NOTIFICATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE BEFORE BEGINNING ANY ACTIVITY THAT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFY A RIVER STREAM OR LAKE IF THIS ACTIVITY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT. ON FISH AND WILDLIFE RESOURCES THAT CDF CD OF W. MAY REQUIRE A LAKE AND STREAM THAT ALTERATION AGREEMENT THAT INCLUDES MITIGATION MEASURES TO PROTECT THESE RESOURCES. HOWEVER TO ENSURE THIS PROGRAM FUNCTIONS AS INTENDED AND CONTINUES TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECT OUR FISHERY RESOURCES IT'S IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE. THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THIS LAW ACTUALLY APPLIES THAT MEANS BEING ABLE TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE BOUNDARIES. IN WHICH IF YOU DO WORK. IT REQUIRES NOTIFICATION. A TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE DEFINES THE TERMS RIVER AND STREAM. AND CONFIRMS THAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM THE DEFINITIONS OF BANK BAD IN CHANNEL ARE CONSISTENT. WITH EXISTING CASE LAW THAT'S ALREADY ON THE BOOKS AND THE LONG STANDING PRACTICAL UNDERSTANDING. PEOPLE HAVE OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A STREAM. I BELIEVE THIS CLARITY WILL HELP. INTO FIRST OF ALL ALLOW RATE THE THE REGULATED COMMUNITY. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S REQUIRED OF THEM AND ALSO ENSURE THAT THIS LA MEETS ITS PURPOSE PAN INSIDE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY FOUR FORTY TWO. TWO WITNESSES. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JACK CRISIS IN YOUR COUNSEL WITH A CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION REPRESENTING FARMERS RANCHERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SO THE CLARITY IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER POINTED OUT IS WHAT THE OBJECTIVE IS HERE SO OUR MEMBERS CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR OBLIGATION IS UNDER THE LAW. I THIS IS. EQUALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN HOW THE LAKE AND STREAM BED ALTERATION AGREEMENT PROGRAM WORKS IT'S REALLY ASTUTE TWO STEP PROCESS THE FIRST STEP IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONDUCT A CERTAIN ACTIVITY. YOU HAVE TO NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT THAT NOTIFICATION MEANS COMPLETING THE FORM AND PAYING A FEE THAT IS AT A MINIMUM FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS. SO THE NOTIFICATION DOESN'T IT DOES REQUIRE SOME WORK. AFTER THE SECOND. STEP IN THE PROCESS IS THE IMPACT ANALYSIS BY THE DEPARTMENT IF THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES IS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER POINTED OUT THAT IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT. FISH AND WILDLIFE RESOURCES THEN AS LAKE AND STREAM BED ALTERATION AGREEMENTS REQUIRED WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS FOCUS IN ON THAT FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS THERE'S A. PROBLEM EMERGING FOR MANY OF FR MEMBERS FARMERS RANCHERS IN CALIFORNIA. ABOUT WHERE. A STREAM BED ALTERATION AN ACTIVITY REQUIRES NOTIFICATION. WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR MEMBERS INSTANCES WHERE DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE FIELD STAFF ARE INDICATING ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT WITH AND A STREAM OR RIVER OR WHAT THEY WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND TO BE A STREAM OR RIVER. ARE. REQUIRE NOTIFICATION WE WANT TO HONE IN AND CLARIFY FOR FOLKS WHAT THAT IS AND I THINK AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE HELP WITH THAT. THE KEY EXAMPLES FROM THE TEXT OF THE STATUTE A REALLY YOU KNOW EITHER AN ARTIFICIAL WATER CONVEYANCE SO WATER CONVEYANCE DEBTS THAT'S NOT. A PART OF A NATURAL RIVER OR ALSO ACTIVITIES OCCUR OUTSIDE THE CREEK BUT MAY HAVE BEEN MORE WATER HAD FLOODED IN THE PAST. BECAUSE OF THE WAY TO THE PROGRAM WORKS AND THE FACT THAT IT'S THE OBLIGATIONS ON THE PERSON CONDUCTING THE ACTIVITY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE HOW THE PROGRAM FUNCTIONS AND FOR THE FAIRNESS TO THE ACTORS THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE TO NOTIFY. AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE. SEEKS TO DO THIS TO ME. BANK ILL BE VERY HELPFUL BOTH FOR. THE FOLKS WHO ARE MANAGING LAND AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S ENFORCEMENT OF IT. THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE TERM GUIDANCE INSISTED FROM THIS COMMITTEE PARTICULARLY MISTER JACQUI AND AND. LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK. WITHOUT THE COMMITTEE AND DEPARTMENT ON THIS NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BABRI WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE VALLEY ATWATER COALITION AND THE CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL ASSOCIATION. MEMBERS OF THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS UP PROVIDE FARM WATER. DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL WORKS FOR THE RANCHERS AND CATTLEMEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND AND FOR OUR URBAN AREAS AND WE OFTEN HAVE A MAN MADE FACILITIES DRAINAGE CANALS IRRIGATION CANALS THAT INTERSECTS AN INTERVAL ACTS WITH NATURAL WATERCOURSES. WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IT TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE DRAW A BRIGHT LINE BETWEEN THE NATURAL WATER COURSES IN THE MAN MADE. A CONVEYANCE IS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR IRRIGATION FLOOD CONTROL WITH US FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOT. CARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CATHOLIC COLOR THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR THE SPONSORS AND COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH US ON THE US SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. WHICH WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT I DO URGE THE COMMITTEE TO GIVE THUMBS UP ON THE BILL AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE AUTHOR THINKING Q.. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARIAN WARMER DAM OF RAIL COUNTY ASSOCIATION WHICH JEFFREY GOLDBERG FOR CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. YOU HAVE ANYONE WISHING TO OPPOSE THE BILL. TESTIFYING OPPOSITION. THE BILL. GOOD MORNING. FIRST LET ME JUST POLITICS AT THE COMBINATION OF A COLD AND. ALLERGIES AT THE SAME TIME BUT NOW MY NAME IS KIM DELFINO AND I'M THE STATE DIRECTOR FOR DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE. AND. WE ARE CONTINUING TO OPPOSE THE BILL ALTHOUGH WE DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT OF THE AUTHOR TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE WITH THE AMENDMENTS WHICH TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL. HOWEVER. EVEN WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS WE STILL ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH WHAT THE BILL DOES. FIRST THE BILL I BELIEVE IT'S REALLY DIRECTED AT KIND OF ADDRESS UNCERTAINTIES. UNCERTAINTIES WITH THE PROCESS. IN TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT IS A STREAM OR RIVER. HYDRO GEO MORPHOLOGY IS A VERY HE COMPLICATED SCIENCE AND WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS SORT OF PUT IN BLACK AND WHITE TERMS HOW YOU DEFINE THE STREET WHEN A RIVER. THAT'S DIFFICULT TO TO. IN PARTICULAR. THERE'S NO DEFINITION THAT'S BEING PRO PROVIDED BY THE NEW. A DEFINITION ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A DEFINITE CHANNEL OR QUARTERS THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING BAD BANKER CHANNEL. THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED A PRE EXISTING RIVER SO I BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT THIS BILL WOULD PROBABLY CREATE EVEN MORE UNCERTAINTY. WITH TO APARTMENT EFFICIENT Y. LIFE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM. THE OTHER ISSUE I RAY I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT A MY ORGANIZATION A PARTICULAR WORKS IN THE DESERT AND IN THE ARID. LANDSCAPE OF A LOT OF TIMES WHAT MAY THINK WHAT WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK IS A RIVER THAT BY DEFINITION OF A RIVER MAYBE UP IN THE NORTH NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IN THE DRY. AIRED SYSTEM WHERE SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE WALKING ACROSS THAT AREA YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE YOU'RE WALKING THROUGH WHAT IS A DRY DESERT WASH. UNTIL YOU KNOW A YEAR OR TWO LATER WHEN YOU ACTUALLY OF RAIN YOU HAVE WATER RUNNING THROUGH THERE. TO REQUIRE A DEFINITE BANK WOULD PERHAPS LEAVE OUT HUGE PORTIONS OF WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A WHAT WOULD BE NORMALLY COVERED UNDER THE STREAM THAT ALTERATION JURISDICTION. AND I'D I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS AN INTENDED PART OF HOW THIS DEFINITION WAS PUT TOGETHER BUT THAT IS VERY MUCH LIKELY WILL BE THE RESULT. MOVING FORWARD. AND SO I THINK MY SUGGESTION AS THIS BILL. MOVES FORWARD IS THAT FRANKLY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH A STE THE REGULATORY PROCESS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS TRYING TO DEFINE USING THE SCIENCE OF HYDROGEN MORPHOLOGY AND ALL OF THE VARIATIONS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF WHAT IS A RIVER STREAM. THAT INS ISN'T SOMETHING REALLY WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS SUPPOSED TO BE CRAFTING THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED A DEFINITIONS IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS CONDUCTED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE REGULATORY PROCESS. AND PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT BEEN MOVING FORWARD WITH REGULATIONS ON THIS ISSUE AND THAT IS WHY WE FIND OURSELVES IN HAVING THIS A DISCUSSION. WITH THAT BEING SAID I KNOW I WOULD URGE THAT THAT BE MAYBE THE APPROACH TAKEN WITH THE SPELL ON BUT AT THE VERY MINIMUM WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OFFER IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. BECAUSE AGAIN THE POINT OF THE STREAMBED ALTERATION PROGRAM IS TO PROTECT FISH AND WILDLIFE THAT IS THE POINT OF IT. IF THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT IMP IN A. DIVERT OR IMPACT FLOW THE AMOUNT QUALITY QUANTITY TIMING OF WHEN WATER IS DELIVERED. IN SYSTEMS THAT IS HAVING A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE FISH AND WILDLIFE AND IT IS NOT A A PROGRAM THAT IS JUST SIMPLY THERE TO MAKE UP PROJECTS COMPLICATED IS THERE TO SERVE A PURPOSE. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT IN MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD THAT IT ACTUALLY GETS OUT. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING THE FISH AND WILDLIFE RESOURCES THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO PROTECT THANK YOU. YOU KNOW ALSO WISH TO ADD ON OPPOSITION PACKAGE OF THIS YEAR CLIP CALIFORNIA ALSO POST. ONE OF THEM I DON'T KNOW WITHOUT A ONE CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. MARK FENCED MAKER FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND APART OPPOSITION. SEEN KNOWN ELSE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DOCTOR CHAU ARE I'M ONE DAY ARE NOT SOMETIME WHEN. AS YOU CAN RESPOND TO HER UNCERTAINTIES. OF THE OPPOSITION. YEAH I THINK GO A WAS GOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN THE CLOSE IF IT IF YOU WANT ME TO DO IT NOW I CAN. SO I THINK I CAN APPRECIATE THAT WERE OPPOSITION IS COMING FROM WE DID JUST GET NOTICE FROM THEM ON THURSDAY. AND THEN THERE WAS A COMMITTEE AMENDMENT THAT ADDRESSED WILDLIFE. WHICH I BELIEVE ADDRESSES A LOT OF THE CONCERNS FROM OPPOSITION. I I APPRECIATE WHAT'S BEING BROUGHT UP ABOUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENS ON THE DESERT AND WHAT HAPPENS UP HERE IN THE NORTH ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE REASON FOR THIS BILL. IS THAT A STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED RELIEVED LARGELY FOCUSED ON THE DESERT COMMUNITY IS BEING YOU. HAS BEEN USED UP HERE IN THE NORTH AND SO THERE IS THIS UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE WE AREN'T MAKING THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN. SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS. AND WE'RE I WOULD VERY RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE IS A AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING FOR US OF THE LEGISLATURE. IS NO WE DON'T JUST LEAVE THIS TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS IT'S OUR JOB TO PASS LAW IT'S OUR JOB TO ESTABLISH THE STATUTE. AND THEN THE AGENCY WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO DO SOME FURTHER DEFINITION IN THEIR IN THEIR REGULATIONS. BUT WITHIN THE CONFINES OF WHAT WE ESTABLISH. IS THE LAW AND SO WE NEED TO START DOING THAT AS A LEGISLATURE AGAIN INSANE WE ARE THE ONES THAT ESTABLISH THAT. AND THEN THE AGENCIES THAT YOU KNOW DOESN'T THAT'S BACKWARD PROCESS TO ME. THAT WE SAID NO WE DON'T LEGISLATE WE DISALLOW THE REGULATORS TO PASS LAN IN AND DEFINED THIS NO WE SHOULD. DEFINE THOSE PARAMETERS BROADLY. AND THEN THE REGULATORY COMMUNITY DOES ITS JOB I WILL SAY WE ARE WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN MEETINGS. WITH THE DIRECTOR I WOULD VERY MUCH OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS A MINT ON LANGUAGE FROM THEM. I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE FINAL PRODUCT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE WORKING WITH A OPPOSITION ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED WITH THIS. BUT IT IS NEEDED AND I THINK WE NEED TO START HERE'S LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHING NODE WHAT THE RULES ARE SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE CERTAINTY. AND SO I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. NOT YOU KNOW THIS LEGISLATION MOVING FOR. QUESTION FROM. OKAY IT PLEASE. I'M I A. A DEFINITE APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I CAN SEE WHERE FOUND THE LACK OF DEFINITION IS CAUSING A PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE IN YOUR AREA. A BUT TO ME THIS IS A BIT OF A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT REALLY RUNS INTO PROLEMS ACROSS THE STATE. AND I THINK THAT WHERE AGENCIES TO DO A GOOD JOB BUT I THINK THE ROLE IS AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WE CAN'T DEFAULT TO THEM BUT WE ALSO CAN GIVE THEM STRONG INSTRUCTION. AND THE ONE THING THAT A REGULATORY AGENCY HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO. HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOLUTIONS ARE FOR DIFFERENT AREAS AND TO TREAT DIFFERENT AREAS DIFFERENTLY SO I CAN'T SUPPORT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT REDEFINES. THINGS REALLY TO SUIT ONE AREA WHERE IT CAN BE YOU KNOW I THINK A REAL REAL PROBLEM IN OTHER AREAS I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ARE BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO GET RECONCILED RING RELIEF TO THE REGULATED COMMUNITY IN YOUR AREA BECAUSE I. I CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR PROBLEM I'M I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS PLAYS OUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. THANK YOU. OKAY TO NONO'S ENQUIST COMES IS DOES HAVE A. TO PASS AS AMENDED. IS THERE A MOTION TO MOVE. THE MOTION. MOST IN A SECOND. MEMSIC TRIP TO CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. EDUARDO GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE GALLAGHER.

WE'LL KEEP THAT THE. ON CALL. YOUR NEXT ITEM THAT WAS GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN AND I WHICH WOULD A STEP WHICH AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE LANDOWNERS TO MAINTAIN COVER CROPS WERE NATURAL VEGETATION ON IDLED AGRICULTURAL LANDS. TO ABIDE HABITAT AND NESTING COVER FOR WATERFOWL AND OTHER WILDLIFE. I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT I THINK THIS WOULD BE. A GOOD. THAT PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH. AND I'D ASK YOUR ABOUT. MOTION AND SECOND IT DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION PLEASE PROCEED. I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKEDLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION ON THE BILL WOULD HELP TO FILL IMPORTANT NEED A PROVIDING ADDITIONAL NESTING COVER AND UPLAND HABITAT. FOR WATERFOWL ANOTHER GAME BIRDS ON PRIVATE LANDS THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY JOINT VENTURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OF WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ARE BOTH SIGNATURE SIGNATORIES TO. I'M IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY DO TWO THINGS IT WOULD STRENGTHEN A POLICY HAS OF MENTIONED BEFORE IN THE WATER CODE. THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE LANDOWNERS TO PROVIDE OUR TO MAINTAIN NESTING COVER THAT'S NON IRRIGATED NESTING COVER. FOR WILDLIFE SO LONG AS ALL THE WATER TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE EXISTING LAW. HAS NOT WORKED WE HAD A POLICY IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO TRAIN COURAGE THIS HABITAT IN A NUMBER OF FOLLOWING TRANSFERS AND WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY NEW HABITAT CREATED. SORT TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT. AS WAS ALSO MENTIONED ALSO CREATES AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS BASED ON THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM WHICH IS A FARM BILL PROGRAM THAT HAS DONE WONDERFUL THINGS FOR WATERFOWL AND OTHER BIRDS IN THE UPPER MIDWEST THE DAKOTAS. AND HAS REALLY BEEN CREDITED WITH RESTORING WATERFOWL POPULATIONS IN THOSE AREAS. ARE BILL WOULD. CREATE A CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC PROGRAM. PACIFIC FLEET TAILORED TO OUR GROWERS AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED TO REALLY. IMPROVE OUR OUR WATER FOUND OTHER PER POPULATIONS HERE SO WE ARE RISK REAP ASPECT FULLY I REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. IT'S GOODNESS YES MY NAME IS DAN CONNELLY I AM. WITH PRESENTS FOR EVER. AND. THIS PROGRAM HAS SOME VERY SOME REALLY BROAD OF BENEFITS. OBVIOUSLY OUR PRIMARY INTEREST IS IN IN AND UPLAND UPLAND GAME BIRD NESTING. BUT IT ALSO HAS. BENEFITS TO AIR QUALITY SOIL FERTILITY FLOOD CONTROL. OUR WATER QUALITY CARBON SEQUESTRATION TALK A LITTLE BIT EARLIER ABOUT. BENEFICIAL INSECTS MONARCH BUTTERFLIES. VIEW SCAPIN AND AND OBVIOUSLY WILDLIFE SO IT'S A IT'S A VERY BROAD. THE VERY BROAD DATA. BENEFITS TO THIS IS JUST BASS HE WIPED Y. STEWARDSHIP OF THE LAND IF YOU'RE GONNA IT'S PART OF A TRANSFER. IN HOW WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE THE LAND IF IT'S IF IT'S AND IT LOOKED LIKE A PARKING LOT OR IF YOU HAVE SOME VEGETATION ON THAT LAND SO. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST US SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR THOSE WANTING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. NAME ORGANIZATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARIAN WARMER DAMMIT THROUGHOUT COUNTIES RIPLEY'S TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE SIMILAR TO EARLIER MEASURE. A WE WILL LEAVE THIS HELPS CONTRIBUTE TO THE OF ECOLOGICAL OUT ATTRIBUTES OF THE VALLEYS. AS WELL AS KEEPING THE LANDS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY TAX ROLLS THANK YOU. JERRY LINK DUCKS UNLIMITED SUPPORT.

LAURIE JACOBS CALIFORNIANS ONE FOR CONSERVATION AND SUPPORT. PAT FITZ MORRISON WITH CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. KEVIN FELLOW WITH THE NATIONAL WILD TURKEY FEDERATION STRONG SUPPORT. OKAY ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. I'M BACK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KATHY CALLED METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I WE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE A COALITION LETTER OF ABOUT ELEVEN SIGNATORIES TO REPRESENT WATER AGENCIES WHO THEIR DARK DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY PARTICIPATE THE WATER TRANSFER MARKET. AND OUR LETTER OUTLINES OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. UP OVER THE YEARS MANY THE SIGNATORIES OF TO THE LETTER HAVE IMPLEMENTED WATER TRANSFERS IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE PURE ON GW ARE. AND HISTORICALLY THOSE TWO AGENCIES HAVE NOT ALLOWED ANY VEGETATION LANDS FOLLOW TO PRODUCE WATER FOR WATER TRANSFERS. THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY IN STILL IMPORT TODAY IT ACCURATE ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSUMED BY THE FOREGOING FOREGONE CROP ABSENT THE WATER TRANSFER. LET ME EMPHASIZE HERE WE BELIEVE THAT MAINTAINING USEFUL WATER HAVE WILDLIFE HABITAT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE. A INCOMPATIBLE WITH WATER TRANSFERS. HOWEVER THERE'S GOT TO BE AN APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT MADE UP TO THE AMOUNT OF WATER ELIGIBLE FOR THE TRANSFER TO ACCOUNT FOR CONSUMPTIVE USE IS NECESSARY TO MAIN HABITAT OR IDLE FARMLAND. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF WATER ELIGIBLE FOR THE TRANSFER MUST BE TRANSPARENT. AND IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY BE A COSTS FOR COMPLETING THE WATER TRANSFER UNLESS OTHER FUNDS ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE. SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB SEVEN FORTY NINE BY SENATOR A LOS WALK BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. D. W. R. HAS ALLOWED NON IRRIGATED VEGETATION REMAIN ON THE FALLOW LANDS IF THE LANDOWNER CAN DEMONSTRATESUCH VEGETATIONS NOT CONSUMING TRANSFERRED WATER. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS DWI TO ENSURE THAT LEGAL WATER USERS ARE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANY VEGETATION CONSUMING WATER ON THAT FELLOW PLAN. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT UNDER THE BILL OF FARMERS COULD BE PAID BOTH TO ALLOW VEGETATION REMAIN ON AYE THE LANDS AS WELL AS REMOVING VEGETATION FROM AYE THE LANCE REPLIED WATER TRANSFER SUPPLIES. THIS COULD VERY MUCH MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR D. W. ART AND FORCES WATER TRANSFER RULES SINCE A FARMER WANNA MAXIMIZE BOTH FUNDING STREAMS. BY ARGUING THAT ANY VEGETATION LEFT ON AYE THE LANCE IS NOT CONSUMING WATER. SO WE BELIEVE THE EXISTING LAW ALREADY STRIKES A BALANCE WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR ENCOURAGING COVER CROPS AS WELL AS PROTECTING WATER TRANSFERS. AND THAT WAS THE COMPROMISE THAT WE STRUCK ALONG WITH OTHER OPPONENTS AND THE SUPPORTERS AND PROPONENTS BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. SADDAM MINIMUM WE WOULD ASK THAT THE BILL BE REVISED TO ELIMINATE ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO FORGET OF YARD FROM FORCES WATER TRANSFER RULES. THINKING. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO. STATE FOR THE RECORD THEIR OPPOSITION BILL. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND MANY WERE KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF MOJAVE WATER AGENCY MUSLIMS WATER DISTRICT. AND WE ARE EQUALLY CONCERNED WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE. GOAL OF INCREASE UPLAND HABITAT WE THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE BUT WE ARE. WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO GET CLARIFICATION ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE WATER TRANSFERRED ACCURATELY THANKS. YOU CHAIR MEMBERS CANDIDATE JOB ON BEHALF OF THE KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY IN SAN BENITO VALLEY MISS WATER DISTRICT. BOBBY CISSY AT OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE IN SCHOOLS. CHRISTY FOR A WITH THREE VALLEY'S ADMISSIBLE WATER DISTRICT WE ARE ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY. AND MW DEAN MYTHICAL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE BILL DOES HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE MISTER GALLAGHER AYE. I HATE TO COME OUT OF THE COMMITTEE NOT VOTING FOR AT LEAST ONE OF YOUR FILMS. ARE YOU WILLING TO WORK WITH THE WATER AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CONCERNS. YES. AND WE ALREADY HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS AND. SO ONE I'VE ALREADY TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE MOSQUITO VECTOR CONTROL. ASSOCIATION OF SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS AND KNOW. MY I AM COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE WATER TRANSFER ISSUE TOO I MEAN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT AS FIND THAT. THAT HAPPY MEDIUM YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN THERE ARE WATER TRANSFERS RIGHT NOW. BASICALLYTHE RULES YOU JUST FOLLOW THOSE COMPLETELY GRAY AND SO THERE'S NOTHING GROWING THERE AT ALL. AND ACTUALLY HAS EVEN BEEN SOME ISSUES TAXI DOWN IN THE DELTA WHERE THERE WAS A TRANSFER. AND OR TO KEEP THE VEGETATION OFF YOU HAVE TO DO AERIAL SPRAYS IN AN AERIAL SPRAY WAS DONE IN WHICH ALL THE IT IS ACTUALLY THE DELTA WINDS PICKED UP AND CARRIED IT OVER ALL BUNCH OF. OTHER CROPLAND AND SO THE AND THERE WAS A HUGE LAWSUIT OVER AND LIABILITIES SO. YOU KNOW. IT'S DIFFICULT TO KEEP THEM COMPLETELY CLEAN IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THERE'S SOME LIABILITY CONCERNS. BUT ALSO I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES AND EVEN THE OPPOSITION SAID WE WANT TO HAVE ACTUALLY IF WE CAN DO NON IRRIGATED COVER CROP ON THIS THAT'S ACTUALLY BETTER FOR WILDLIFE. THEN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S KIND OF THE GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT IS TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN HAVE AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM IN PLACE. SO THE LANDOWNERS DO THAT SO EVEN MORE DROUGHT. OR WERE HAVING TO DO WATER TRANSFERS WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE THAT HABITAT THAT IS NEEDED BY MIGRATORY. WATER FELL AND I THINK THERE'S A HAPPY BALANCE TO DO THAT I THINK WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS HOUSE THAT ACCOUNTED FOR IF THERE'S ANY WATER LOST. AN ARM AND I THINK I THINK WE CAN DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING. TO THAT ISSUE AGAIN I'M NOT. TOTALLY TIED TO JUSTICE LANGUAGE AND I'LL BE WORKING WITH THEM FEEL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE WATER AGENCY YES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED AND. THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO VOTE ON IT ON THE FLOOR AS WELL SO. I ALSO PUT IT TODAY GIVEN YOUR COMMITMENT DOES NOT LOVE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS YOUR COMMENTS SEEN NONE THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND. MADE BY MISTER BIGELOW SHOULD GLORIA THAT DOES HAVE A DO PASS. REGULATION TO APPROPRIATIONS. WE'LL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES. BROKAW. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS EDUARDO GARCIA I. SEE I GALLAGHER AYE GALLAGHER AYE BIGELOW. IT LOW AYE CARILLO. CHOI. CHIU. FRIEDMAN I. FRIEDMAN I GLORIA AYE GLORIA AYE HARPER AYE AYE HARPER AYE KALRA. LEVINE. MATHIS I MATHIS AYE RUBIO AYE RUBIO AYE SOLACE. NO SOLACE NO WOULD. WE WILL LEAVE THE CULT ON THAT ITEM AS WELL. IN EXCITED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. PROUD TO PRESENT A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. AND FOR ME A BEAST THIRTY FORTY FIVE. FEEL WHEN I INITIALLY INTRODUCED THIS BILL IS TRYING TO GET OUT. A PROBLEM THAT THAT IT REALLY WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE OROVILLE CRISIS. AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE. THE SAME AGENCY RIGHT NOW THAT. OPERATES AND MAINTAINS THE STATE WATER PROJECT INCLUDING OROVILLE DAM. IS ALSO THE SAME AGENCY THAT PROVIDES THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. OF PROVIDES INSPECTIONS AND PROVIDES THE FEEDBACK AND REGULATES. THE ENTITY THAT'S OPERATING THAT'S DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES OPERATES. A THE DAMS A MAINTAINS THEM AND IN THEIR DIVISION OF DAM SAFETY IS TASKED WITH THEN REGULATING. HOW THAT OPERATION TO MAINTAIN MAINTENANCE IS TAKING PLACE SO? THE ORIGINAL INTENT HERE WAS TO ACTUALLY TAKE DIVISION A DAM SAFETY OUT OF THE W. ARE AND MAKE IT. AND PUTIT SEPARATED FROM DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND BUT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED I THINK WOULD DO THE THE SAME THING. AND I'M I ACTUALLY ACTUALLY IN AND LOOKING AT THEM. I THINK IT OPENS UP A CONVERSATION A REALLY NEED TO HAVE ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERMATH OF WAR BILL WHICH IS. SHOULD WE HAVE A DIFFERENT. AND MORE INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT ITSELF. AND. SO WHAT. I AM GOING TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AND THEN WHAT THAT WOULD DO INSTEAD IS ACTUALLY CREATE AN INDEPENDENT STATE WATER PROJECT COMMISSION NINE MEMBER COMMISSION. I THAT WOULD OVERSEE THE STATE WATER PROJECT. INSISTS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED PREVIOUSLY BY THE LETTER LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. AND I'M. AND I THINK IN THE AFTERMATH OF OROVILLE. THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE HAD. HEARD OF AN OBSCENE THE FORENSIC REPORT WHICH HIGHLIGHTED. AND THERE WERE SOME. MAJOR ISSUES THERE WITHOUT THE W. ARE OPERATED AND MAINTAINED OROVILLE DAM. FOR EXAMPLE IT FOUND ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS IN HUMAN FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THAT. THAT THERE WAS A CULTURAL. A OVERCONFIDENCE IDW ARE ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AND. A REACTIVE VERSUS PROACTIVE APPROACH TO PROJECT MAY MANAGEMENT. THERE WERE BASIC DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE FLAWS THAT WERE. BUT NOT ADDRESS DIMMER OVERLOOKED. AND AND THERE WERE COST CONTROL PRESSURES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE. OF THE REPORT IS WELL THAT THAT LED TO THE CRISIS. AND SO WHAT THIS WHAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WOULD DO IS ACTUALLY CREATE A NEW COMMISSION THAT WOULD PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. AS WE HAVE IN MANY OTHER INSTANCES AND I ACTUALLY AS WE ACTUALLY HAVE IN MANY OTHER STATES. WERE ACTUALLY KIND OF A VERY DIFFERENT CALIFORNIAN THAT WE DON'T HAVE. A AN INDEPENDENT BODY INDEPENDENT COMMISSION PROVIDING THAT OVERSIGHT. AND. SO I THINK THIS IS VERY MUCH SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO. DISCUSS A MOVE FOR OBVIOUS CAESAR COMMITTEE MEMBERS BEING PROPOSED A DAY AND THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS VERY MUCH A DISCUSSION WE NEED TO HAVE IN A DIRECTION WE NEED TO MOVE IN. THE OTHER THINK THAT THE COMMISSION WOULD DO. AND I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AS PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY. THE COMMISSION WOULD BE GOVERNED BY BAGLEY KEENE. THAT SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY NOT QUITE THE CASE WITH DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES RESOURCES RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO HOW THE STATE WATER PROJECT. IS OF MAINTAINED WE DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER HAVE THE SAME TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESS. TWO RECORDS THAT WE WOULD HAVE UNDER BAGLEY KEENE. PASSABLY THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT MEASURE SO. THAT I WOULD ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I WOULD ASK. FOR THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT AS THIS IS A. AND CONTINUED MUCH NEED REFORM. AT DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND ENSURING THE INTEGRITY AND THE SAFETY OF OUR STATE WATER PROJECT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. NOW THANK YOU NICE RIBA. ASK UP FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO COME FORWARD AND. I JUST FIND SUPPORT A BILL. KAREN LANG ON BEHALF OF THE BUTTE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT THE CENTER OF THIS EVENT ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. A BECAUSE OF THE CIRCLE CALIFORNIA WERE SUPPORTIVE AT THE INITIAL CONCEPT THE BILL I'VE JUST HAVEN'T HAD ANY CHANCE TO WAY AND. UNFORTUNATELY BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR TWO WAYS TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING DAMS IN THE STATE BAD DOING SO WHICH COULD INCREASE WATER SUPPLY. WHILE STAYING WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF EXISTING STRUCTURES AND MAKE THOSE OVERALL SAFER. WE WILL LOOK AT THE MOMENT SAID AND WEIGH IN ON THOSE IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU YOU ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON SUPPORT. SUE NO KNAUS ANYONE WISHING TO. DESPITE OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. ED MANNING ON BEHALF THE MOJAVE WATER AGENCIES STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTOR. WE DID NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL. UNTIL NOW. AND THE REASON WE DIDN'T IS MISTER GALLAGHER'S BILLATTEMPT TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE. THAT IMPACTED HIS DISTRICT DIRECTLY WHICH IS THE ISSUE DAM SAFETY. AND THE QUESTION OF THE ROLE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN INSPECTING AROUND FACILITIES WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE. ISSUE FOR DEBATE AND SO WE HELD OFF. BUT THIS IS NOW A RADICAL BILL THIS BILL REVERSES FIFTY YEARS OF HISTORY THE BURNS PORTER AT. AND IN A COMMITTEE AMENDMENT. SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD TAKE. DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND TAKE AWAY THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND JUST PUT IT IN ANOTHER AGENCY. WHEN YOU GONNA CHANGE FIFTY YEARS OF CALIFORNIA WATER STRUCTURE HISTORY GOVERNANCE. PERHAPS. SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN INTERIM STUDY. PERHAPS THE COMMITTEE SHOULD HAVE NUMEROUS INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE WATER BONDS ARE STRUCTURED. THE ROLE OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. THE FACT THAT THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTORS RATE PAYERS ARE THE ONES WHO PAY AND. IN MANY OTHER STATES ACTUALLY THE STRUCTURE IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY PAY THE RATES LIKE MOJAVE WATER AGENCY RATEPAYERS ARE METROPOLITAN. HAVE DIRECT GOVERNANCE OVER THE PROJECT. SO WE CAME HERE TODAY NOT ANTICIPATING BEING IN THIS POSITION. BUT THIS BILL NOW DRAMATICALLY CHANGES THE STRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA WATER POLICY. AND WE WOULD ARGUE THAT PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER DONE NOT IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT. BUT IN A FULL FLEDGED DISCUSSION ON AN ISSUE THAT REALLY MERITS FAR MORE. DISCUSSION AND THOUGHT THAN THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PRISON THE COMMITTEE CATHY COLE AGAIN TO THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT ON JUST TO BUILD SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID ON. HOLIDAYS FOR THE LATE OPPOSE. WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX SITUATION OTHERS FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S READY FOR PRIMETIME YET LEGISLATIVELY. WE SHOULD DUST OFF THAT TWENTY TEN LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION ANALYSIS. MAYBE COME UP WITH SOME HEARINGS AND DEVELOP A PLAN THAT'S FULLY DEVELOPED WITH INPUT FROM STAKE HOLDERS. NOT ALL OPTIONS OF GOVERNANCE. AND OVERSIGHT TRANSPARENCY HAVE BEEN EXPLORED UNDER THE BILL AS PROPOSED. WATER RIGHTS DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS BONDS THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE. AND I WOULD JUST URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THAT IT'S NOT REALLY PRIME TIME YET FOR THIS AND MORE ADVANCED WORK IS NECESSARY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. THE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BOB REBIRTH REAP GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF DESERT WATER AGENCIES. WILL HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL WE ASSOCIATE ARE. CONCERN WITH ABOUT FIVE EXCLAMATION POINTS A. IN ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH PRIOR WITNESSES. FIVE. ANYWHERE ELSE. LORENA BRING IT BACK TO ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS REMEMBERS. THANK YOU. AT. LET'S WANT TO GIVE US GALLAGHER CHANCE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION AND HAVE WE LOOKED AT DOING ANY INTERIM HEARINGS OR ANYTHING ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE SUM WITH THIS WOULD ACTUALLY INTEL AND THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ACTION. SO FIRST THEY WERE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD. BUT IT REALLY GOT THE HEART OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO AND SO. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY THE INVERSE OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO RIGHT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PULL DIVISION A DAM SAFETY. OUT OF DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND MAKE IT INDEPENDENT. BUT ACTUALLY THE CONFLICT GOES AWAY IF YOU JUST TAKE THE STATE WATER PROJECT OUT OF VW ARE. AND THEN THE W. ARE WILL SERVE ITS REGULATORY FUNCTION. OF INSPECTING DAMS ACROSS THE STATE ARM. SO ID IT ACCOMPLISHES THE SAME PURPOSE. AND I WOULD AGREE THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE IT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IT IS. ARM BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT STOPPING THE CONVERSATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OPEN IT UP. AND WE NEED TO START HAVING THE CONVERSATION. YES HAS BEEN FIFTY PLUS YEARS BUT THAT'S FIFTY PLUS YEARS OF WHAT THIS FORENSIC REPORTER SHOWN WAS. A NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO A FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN FLAW IN THE SPILLWAY AT THE AT ORVILLE. AND THAT'S UNDER THE W. ARE UNDER THEIR WATCH THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENED RIGHT IN THE NOTHING FELL APART AND PUT HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND OF MY CONSTITUENTS. AND AT RISK IT'S NOT NOT PAID ATTENTION TO VERY CLEAR FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS CRACKS THAT WERE FORMING IN THAT SPILLWAY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THAT. NOT ME THAT THE FORENSIC TEAM. TOTALLY INDEPENDENT GROUP OF OF EXPERTS LOOKED AT AND SAID THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. A SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO AND UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WAS A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW. AND IT'S YEARS OF OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OF ISSUES NOT BEING ADDRESSED OF ORGANIZATIONAL FLAWS A CULTURE THAT THE INDEPENDENT. FORENSIC TEAM. SAID A CULTURE WHERE THEY CREATED A MYTHOLOGY. A MYTHOLOGY QUOTE UNQUOTE OF WHAT OF THE INTEGRITY OF OF THE STRUCTURE UP THERE. THAT CAN'T BE IGNORED THAT FIFTY PLUS YEARS. OF WHAT I WOULD CALL. NOT VERY GOOD ORGANIZATION NOT GET MAINTENANCE ANNA AND NOT TAKING CARE OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT THAT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT MY DISTRICT RIGHT. IT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE STATE. SENSE THAT THAT FIFTY YEARS OF POOR MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN NOW REVEALED FOR THE WORLD. I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AS WE'VE DONE IN MANY OTHER AREAS. TAKE OVER CONTROL THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN ENSURE. THAT THOSE THINGS ARE DONE RIGHT. ANNA AND I WOULD REMIND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PEOPLE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. NOW THAT. YOU CAN'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER IN OROVILLE DAM. AFTER THE WETTEST YEAR ON RECORD. MANY WATER DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE GOING TO BE FACING WATER SHORTAGE SHORTAGES AND WE'RE BASIC GONNA BE POTENTIALLY BACK IN A DROUGHT. SITUATION BECAUSE OF THAT SAME MISMANAGEMENT. AND SO REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU'RE FROM. IN CALIFORNIA. AND YOU SHOULD WANT. BETTER OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT YOU SHOULD WANT BETTER TRANSPARENCY. THAT'S THE OTHER THING ABOUT THE COMMISSION WE SHOULD WANT BETTER TRANSPARENCY. ABOUT HOW THESE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HOW THESE ISSUES ARE BEING ADDRESSED AND I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHAT THAT COMMISSION LOOKS LIKE? I WANT TO HAVE CONTINUE DISCUSSION ON THAT I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO DISCUSS. AND HAVE OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION I'M NOT GOING AWAY I TO REMIND PEOPLE I AM A REPUBLICAN. THERE'S NOTHING THAT I CAN STEAMROLL THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT. BE OTHERS KNOW WHERE I CAN STEAMROLL ANYTHING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND AND I I THINK THIS IS A GOOD. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S NEW THIS WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. SNOT THIS NEW CONCEPT IT'S BEEN BEING DISCUSSED AND TALKED ABOUT EYES ONE OPEN UP THE DISCUSSION AND CONTINUE IT AND SO THAT'S WHY I WOULD ASK. FOR THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT TODAY A TO MOVE THIS MEASURE FOR. SO IN HEAR DISCUSSIONS AND YOUR RESEARCH ORDER JUST FOLLOW UP AND YOU'VE MENTIONED THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION BUT THERE IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE LITTLE WHO. HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE LEGISLATION OR IN THE BILL CURRENTLY. THE YES IT IT BASICALLY TAKES THE WILL HOOVER COMMISSION'S IDEA OF CREATING A NINE MEMBER COMMISSION THAT WOULD OVERSEE. DE AT THE STATE WATER PROJECT ANNA. AND. YOU KNOW THERE ARE. YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BUT LARGELY IT'S THE SAME IDEA AND CONCEPT THAT WAS PUSHED BY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. OKAY UPSTART BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE LANGUAGE WAS TO. BASICALLY JUST HANDED OVER TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DID ORIGINALLY WAS I WOULD. ORIGINALLY THE BILL WOULD OF TAKEN THE DIVISION OF DAM SAFETY. OUT OF THE W. R. AND PUT IT UNDER NATURAL RESOURCES. NOW WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS IT CREATES A NEW NINE MEMBER COMMISSION. THAT WOULD BE TASKED WITH OVERSEEN THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN BASE WE WOULD TAKE STATE. THE STATE WATER PROJECT OUT OF THE W. ARE AND PUT IT UNDERNEATH THIS THIS COMMISSION. GOT IT THINKS. IN THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TEEN. NO MORE SPECIAL DIETS THIS DOES HAVE A DO PASS. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT FOR OUR RECOMMENDATIONS LOOK I YOU MENTIONED. AT YOUR REPUBLICAN. MY DEMOCRAT. I'M WANTING TO ENTERTAIN THIS CONVERSATION CONSIDERING THAT THE LA O. AND D. LITTLE OVER A HAS MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS CONVERSATION. LAST YEAR WE HAD A A. B.. THREE THIRTEEN SPONSORED BY. ADAM GRAY THAT HAD SOME VERY SIMILAR COMPONENTS TO THIS THAT BOTH A PASSED THIS COMMITTEE AND THE THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR TO GET ONE IN THE MORNING. AND SO OUT OF YOU SEE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION AND I'M WILLING TO CONTINUE TO FURTHER THIS OUT DISCUSSION SO. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.

THREE ELEVENTHS SEVEN. THE BILL WOULD ADDRESS THE SERIOUS CONCERNS BY ALLOWING FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TO TEMPORARY SUSPEND THE PROHIBITION. OF THE USE OF LEAD AMMUNITION FOR THOSE CALIBERS THAT MAY BE REASONABLY AVAILABLE. TO THE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC DURING PEAK TIMES. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MISTER BILL GAINES REPRESENTING THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE BUILDS LAWYERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL GAINES SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK FOUNDATION CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE WHILE SHE FOUNDATION IN THE CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCEMENT FOR CONSERVATION. THIS BILL HAS BEEN PASSED AS BEING ATTEMPT TO SIMPLY REVERSE IF YOU WILL. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RENDON'S AB SEVEN ELEVEN I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IS NOT THE CASE. IN JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN LITTLE OVER A YEAR FROM NOW. NON LEAD AMMUNITION TO BE REQUIRED FOR THE TAKING OF ALL WILDLIFE'S. NOT ONLY BY HUNTERS BUT BY RANCHERS FARMERS AND OTHERS IT MAY BE TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR INVESTMENTS FROM DEPREDATION. THE ODDEST WIN THRILLED WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB SEVEN ELEVEN BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BUT WE DID TAKE SOME COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT WE STILL HAD THE ABILITY TO GO ONLINE MAIL ORDER OR TRAVEL OUT OF STATE TO PURCHASE AMMUNITION. THAT WE NEED TO HUNT AND TO. CONTROL DEPREDATION IN OUR STATE BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE PASSAGE OF AB SEVEN ELEVEN. COUPLE YEARS AGO WE HAD THE PASSAGE OF TWO PROPOSALS THAT PUT SERIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF HUNTERS RANCHERS FARMERS AND OTHERS. TO PURCHASE AMMUNITION THE STATE NO LONGER CAN YOU GO OUT OF STATE VIA INTERNET MAIL ORDER OTHER WAYS WITHOUT GOING TO THE VERY CUMBERSOME AND COSTLY PROCESS OF BRINGING IT BACK THE WAY PERMITTED AMMUNITION DEAR. IN JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN AB SEVEN ELEVEN WILL TAKE FULL EFFECT THAT MEANS IF A RANCHER OR A FARMER OR A HUNDRED DOES NOT. OR CANNOT OBTAIN AMMUNITION THAT DOES NOT LEAD FOR HIS RIFLE. HE CANNOT OR THEY CAN'T DO THEIR DEPREDATION. DUTIES. CALIFORNIA'S THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRES THE USE OF NON LEAD AMMUNITION FOR THE TAKING OF ALL WILDLIFE. CALIFORNIA'S A VERY VERY SMALL MARKET SHARE WHEN IT COMES TO MANUFACTURERS OR MANUFACTURING LEAD AMMUNITION NATIONWIDE THAT SUDDENLY HAVE TO PUT OUT SOME PRODUCTION OF NON TOXIC LOAD INTO THE ARE INDEED TO PUT THEM OUT THERE. AB SEVEN ELEVEN WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION AND THE ABILITY WHAT REQUIRE BUT WOULD GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE LED BAND FOR SPECIFIC CALIBER. IF THOSE LOADS WERE UNAVAILABLE THAT BOARD OF FIVE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. A IS A VERY REASONABLE BOARD THEIR ACTIONS ARE DONE IN PUBLIC FORUM. THEY ALSO HAVE THEIR WILDLIFE RESOURCES COMMITTEE WHICH IS THE SECOND. VENUE IF YOU WILL FOR THEM VETTING YOU KNOW ISSUES SUCH AS THIS ALL STAKEHOLDERS ARE ARE PRESENT IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. IF AMMUNITION OF KNOWLEDGE VARIETY IS AVAILABLE. A. B. THIRTY ONE SEVENTEEN WILL DO NOTHING BUT IF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE IT WILL SIMPLY GIVE THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION. THE AUTHORITY IF THEY'D LIKE TO. TEMPORARILY SUSPEND FOR A SHORT THREE YEAR PERIOD. THE. NON LED PROHIBITION ON AMMUNITION KEEPING HUNTERS IN THE FIELD AND KEEPING RANCHERS AND FARMERS THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR CROPS AND THEIR INVESTMENT. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS PAT FITZ MORRISON WITH CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION AND WE I REPRESENT EIGHT THOUSAND MEMBERS OF DEER HUNTERS IN THE AND THE. AND THE STATE ALL OF WHICH ARE CONCERNED WITH CONSERVATION AND GIVE BACK THROUGH HABITAT PROJECTS OUR PRIMARY MISSION. IS TO HELP WILDLIFE THROUGH PROJECTS WE WORK ALL OVER THE STATE AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MONIES THAT WE REYES GOES TO HABITAT PROJECTS THAT HELP WILDLIFE. I WE WORK WITH CALIFORNIA SPORTFISHING WILDLIFE. US FOR SERVICE US BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT OTHER AGENCIES AS A RESTORATION PARTNER. ARM OVER THE YEARS HUNDREDS OF MADE ENORMOUS CONTRIBUTIONS. TO THE CONSERVATION WILDLIFE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY PROVIDE CRUCIAL FUNDS FOR REFUGE. AND WILDLIFE AREA ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION PROJECTS. A FIFTY PERCENT OF THE. CALIFORNIA PART OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S. BUDGET COMES FROM THE SALE OF LICENSES AND TAGS IN STAMPS. THAT US SPORTSMAN IN THIS GREAT STATE PROVIDE. WE YEAH IN IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN CONGRESS PASSED THE WILDLIFE EIGHT RESTORATION. ACT OR THE PITTMAN ROBSON ACT. SOME OF YOU KNOW ABOUT IT IT. WAS A BILL THAT CREATED ELEVEN PERCENT TAX AND HUNTING EQUIPMENT. SO THAT MEANS ANY TIME A HUNTER GOES INTO A SPORTS AND WAREHOUSE OR BASS PRO SHOPS BY THE HUNTING BACKPACK OR A. SOME BUT OCULAR ZERO BORROW LEVIN PERCENT. OF. IS TAXING GOES BACK TO A A FEDERAL FUND BATON BACK IN WASHINGTON. THOSE FOR THOSE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED BACK TO THE STATES IN THE FORM OF GRANTS. THAT. GO DIRECTLY TO HABITAT PROJECTS IN THE STATE'S UP IN THE STATE'S. SO BETWEEN FORTY FIVE AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS COMES BACK CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S ALL GENERATED BY BY HUNTERS. SO. HAS BUILT STATED NEXT SUMMER ALL SPECIES OF GAME IN THE STATE. WILL BE OUT. HUNTED WITH NON LEAD AMMUNITION SO THAT'LL BE THE LAW. AND. THERE IS THE LAW AND IT WILL BE IN FULL EFFECT NEXT SUMMER. SO. MOST DEER HUNTERS ONLY HAVE ONE OR TWO RIFLES. IF THE IF AMMO IS NOT AVAILABLE THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT. NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE. AND THE WHICH RESULT IN LOST REVENUES FOR THE DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE HABITAT PROJECTS. AND. AND WE WOULD. RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THIS. BILLY PASSED THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. AND THEN MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MARK KELLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL WE BELIEVE THIS BILL PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED FLEXIBILITY FOR CALIFORNIA HHONORS INAPPROPRIATELY LEAVES THE DECISION WITH THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION SO WE. ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. KEVIN VELLA CALIFORNIA NEVADA DISTRICT BIOLOGIST THE NATIONAL WILD TURKEY FEDERATION STRONG SUPPORT. EJ'S CEMETERY ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK FOUNDATION WE. LOOK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. LARA JACOBS PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCEMENT FOR CONSERVATION AND AS A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING ABOUT CREAMERS CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. MORNING JUST AN OLD FIELD WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES ARE TESTIFYING OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. IS COME FORWARD GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN OF AND IT'S ONE OF THAT WE DON'T KNOW. WITHOUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA. OTHER AS THE SCHOOLS CO SPONSOR FOR SPEAKER RENDON'S AB SEVEN ELEVEN A BILL THAT REQUIRED TO PHASE OUT. TOP TOXIC LEAD FROM AMMUNITION TO SHOOT WILDLIFE IT CALIFORNIA WHERE HEARINGS IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTY ONE SEVENTEEN. EVERYONE THIRTY ONE SEVENTEEN. WE STRONGLY AND SINCERELY THAT ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN MATERIALIZED. IF WE ALLOW THE STATE TO FALTER AMMUNITION MANUFACTURES WILL NOT FEEL THE NECESSITY WORRY THE INCENTIVE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS NECESSARY IN NON TOXIC. TOXIC HUNTING AMMUNITION. WHEN WE KNOW ALL WE KNOW A FEW THINGS ABOUT LED. LEAD IS A TOXIC TOXIN THAT IS BAD FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND LEAD AMMUNITION EXPOSES HUMANS TO OTHER ANIMALS. AND OTHER ANIMALS TO THIS LIFE THREATENING POISON. LIKE MERCURY AND ARSENIC LEAD IS UNKNOWN TOXIN THAT HAS BEEN OUTLAWED IN REMOVED FROM PAIN CASTLE ARE GASOLINE PIPELINES. OF CHILDREN'S TOYS AND MANY OTHER PRODUCTS TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND LEAD LEADING SCIENTISTS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AGREE THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD EXPOSURE. FOR HUMANS LET. BAIT BASE PAY A SEES ME LEAD BASED AMMUNITION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOURCES OF LEAD DISCHARGED TO OUR LANDS IN WATER SCIENTISTS AGREE THAT THIS POSES A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT FURTHERMORE. WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA PHASING OUT LEAD AMMUNITION IS WORKING AND RE AT REDUCING LEAD IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROTECTING WILDLIFE AND HUMAN HEALTH. THAT ADMONITION IS KNOWN. AND WELL DOCUMENTED YA IS A WELL DOCUMENTED CRITICAL THREAT TO ENDANGERED SPECIES LIKE THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR. ARE WHEN THE LEAD BAD PHASE OUT BEGAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED. THE CONDOR FACED NEAR EXTENSION EXTINCTION. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN. CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA CONDORS LEFT A AND THESE WERE HELD IN CAPTIVITY TO FOSTER THE SPECIES TO RETURN TO THE TO THE WHILE TODAY. A THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE FLYING CONDORS LIVING IN THE WILD IN ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED PLUS INTACT CAPTIVITY. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN NOT LEAD AMMUNITION WAS REQUIRED IN THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR TOWARD TO WORRY. IN AN ATTEMPT TO ABATE THE CHRONIC LEAD POISONING A FROM THIS CRITICAL ENDANGERED IN ICONIC SPECIES. THE BAND IN THE CONDUCT TERRITORY WHICH SUCCESSFULLY AND ARE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN DECREASING OVERALL BLOOD LEVELS LED BLOOD LEVELS ARE AND CASES OF TALKS TALKS. SO. CITY. AND WILDLIFE ARE IT IS. IT IT IT ONLY ARE. IN WE KNOW THAT IT ONLY TAKES A TINY AMOUNT OF LEAD ARE DEPLOYED IN ANIMALS CAUSING IMMENSE SUFFERING BEFORE KILLING THEM. ARE AND THAT THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO ELIMINATE LAID OUT LEAD AMMUNITION WE NEED. TO LET THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE DO ITS JOB AND PROTECT OUR WILDLIFE MORE THAN A HUNDRED THIRTY SPECIES ARE AT RISK OF POISONING BY. SPENT LET AYE MUNITION ARE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY JOB OR JUST AS IMPORTANT AND WE MUST KEEP DISCUSS SPEAKER RENDON THEY BE SEVEN ELEVEN. IN PLACE AND NOT ROLL BACK ANY PROVISION SIGNED INTO LAW AND IS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT WE STRONGLY OPPOSE. AB THIRTY ONE SEVENTEEN AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. I AM. I THINK IT'S STILL MORNING GOOD GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S KIM DELFINO AND I'M THE DIRECTOR WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE WE WERE ALSO A SPONSOR OF THE BILL AB SEVEN ELEVEN. VIRGIN ARE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THIS BILL LIKE. WON SAID IS PREMATURE AND AND REALLY IT'S FRANKLY UNNECESSARY UP A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL WHEN WE. WHEN WE AGREED TO A FIVE YEAR PHASE OUT OF AMMUNITION WE'VE FRANKLY BELOW BELIEVE HAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY GIVING THEM A LOT OF TIME BECAUSE THERE WAS A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN STUDY. THAT SHOWED. THAT SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF A HUNDRED ELEVEN STORES ALREADY WERE STOCKING NON LEAD AMMUNITION AND THAT THE STATE CONCLUDED THERE WERE NO REASONABLE VARIES IN CALIFORNIA. REGULATING THE USE OF NON LEAD AMMUNITION ON ALL STATE PREVALENCE BY TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID. WE BELIEVED THAT IN THE INTERESTS OF WORKING WITH THE BRIT THE HONEYED COMMUNITY WE WOULD GIVE A LONGER PHASE OUT. ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO WORK THROUGH IT AND THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A VERY DETAILED AND EXTENSIVE PROCESS. WHERE THEY HAVE ACTUALLY PUSHED OUT THE MAJORITY OF THE LEAD TO PHASE OUT TO JULY TWENTY NINETEEN? WE NEED TO HAVE A FIXED DATE FOR PHASE OUT AND IT WAS IMPORTANT BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE WAS PHASING OUT THE USE OF SHOT FOR A WATER MIGRATORY WATERFOWL. IT IS IMPORTANT NOW BECAUSE YOU NEED TO DRIVE YOU NEED CERTAINTY TO DRIVE MARKET DEMAND. CREATING UNCERTAINTY BY CREATING A PROCESS THAT THIS BILL CREATES THAT WOULD ALLOW DIFFERENT CALIBERS TO TO POTENTIALLYPAID OUT AT RANDOM TIMES WHEN WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH CALPERS THEY MIGHT BE. CREATE A MOVING TARGET. AND AND FRANKLY IT'S UNFAIR TO THOSE WHO'VE ALREADY RESPONSIBLY ANTICIPATED AND RESPONDED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ALLOWS FOR CONTINUE TO LEASE OF TOXIC LEAD AMMUNITION ENVIRONMENT. FURTHER IF THE AVAILABILITY OF NON LIVE AMMUNITION WAS TRULY A PROBLEM FOR HUNTING THEN WHY WAS IT REPORTED JUST LAST WEEK IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NATIONAL WILD PICKING USDA TASK FORCE MEETING. THAT USDA WILDLIFE SERVICES WHICH IS THE FEDERAL ENTITY IN CHARGE OF. KILLING A AT NUISANCE ANIMALS AND ALL DIFFERENT KINDS. SO THEY'LL BE USING ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF AMMUNITION BY THE WAY WHY WAS IT REPORTED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO CONVERT TO ALL NON LEADING AMMUNITION IN THEIR FIELD SERVICES. A BECOME THE NUMBER ONE CONSUMER OF NON LEAD AMMUNITION. WHILE IT SERVICES KILLED FOREIGN HALF MILLION ANIMALS A YEAR. SO FRANKLY THAT'S A HECK OF A MARKET MOVER AND I THINK WE'LL BE PUSHING THE MARKET EVEN FURTHER. FINALLY WITH RESPECT S. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE. THE ISSUE ABOUT ACE AB SEVEN ELEVEN WHAT SPECIFICALLY CONSIDERED WHEN AT SB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WAS GOING FORWARD AND IN FACT ON IN THE PENAL CODE SECTION THREE OH THREE FOUR FIVE P.. THERE'S A NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE FOR COMMERCIAL HUNTING CLUBS DOMESTIC GAME BIRD HUNTING CLUBS DOMESTICATED MIGRATORY BIRD SHOOTING CLUBS AND NONPROFIT MUTUAL IN PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATIONS ORGANIZE PURSUIT OF CORPORATION CODES AND ENGAGES IN RECREATIONAL SHOOTING UNLAWFUL HUNTING ACTIVITY. SO. AND THEN FINALLY YOU KNOW THE. S. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVES A REQUIREMENT OF NOW HAVING FEDERAL OF HAVING CALIFORNIA LICENSED. AMMUNITION OF. SELLERS IS MOVING FORWARD. WALMART DICK'S SPORTING GOODS BASS PRO SHOPS THEY'RE ALL SELLING AT NON LEAD AMMUNITION. BOB AND THAT WITH RESPECT TO ONLINE SALES ON YOU CAN BY THE NON LET AMMUNITION ONLINE. IT DOES HAVE TO BE DELIVERED TO A FEDERALLY LICENSED. OF WHAT IT WHAT'S THE RIGHT WORD A A FEDERAL FIREARMS LICENSED OF ENTITY. HOWEVER IN PERUSING THROUGH WEBSITES ON ONLINE AMMO SALES ARE UP AND RUNNING FROM CROSS ARMORY THINK THEY CITED SOMEONE IN THIS WAS FROM. JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN SAYING THAT AT THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY GLOBAL. GUN OWNERS REPORTS THERE'S LEAPS ONE OUTFIT RUNNING A GREAT OPERATION RIFLE SHOT IN DEFENSE OF HANDGUN AMMUNITION PURCHASES FROM BULK AMMO. HAVE SHOWN UP TO BE AN EASY PROCESS TO ORDER ONLINE THE A LARGE SELECTION AVAILABLE ONLINE AND ORDERING IS EASY THE AMMUNITION SHOWS UP IN ABOUT A WEEK. SO I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT. THIS IS REALLY THE THE PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE OF PUTTING FORWARD AS AND ALSO I THINK THAT IF YOU ALLOW THE. A PROCESS OF. SETTING UP THIS EXEMPTION YOU WILL BE CUTTING OUT THE HEART OF AB SEVEN ELEVEN AND. FURTHER DELAYING WHAT IS REALLY WITH THE INTENT WHEN SPEAKER RENDON PUT THIS BILL TOGETHER AND THAT IS TWO AND A VERY TOXIC. A AND A CONTAMINANT FROM GOING INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SETTING UP A VERY REASONABLE PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT PHASE OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. BOB GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS RECALL MUSTERED ANOTHER WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND FIVE YEARS SEEMS LIKE AMPLE TIME TO TRANSITION TO A NEW AMMUNITION. AND WE DO NOT NEED MORE POISON IN THE ENVIRONMENT. NEW HOUSE. THEY BRING IT BACK AND QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. KALRA. THANK YOU SHARON AND I THINK MISS MATHIS BRING THIS FORWARD. THE. A LOT OF REFERENCE BOTH IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT AND THE CONVERSATION ABOUT AB SEVEN ELEVEN AND ITS INTENT. OF AND DID YOU REACH OUT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPEAKER. ABOUT A. B. SEVERAL OF AND ABOUT THIS BILL AS A RELEASED AB SEVEN IT'S A IN KNOW IT IT IT'S THE SPEAKERS BILL AND OBVIOUSLY YOU LIKE AND WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO ASCERTAIN OR CHANGE THAT THAT THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION. ALL ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO DO IS ALLOW. THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOBS. SO I ME AND WITH THAT A I'D LOVE FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH THE SPEAKER AND WITH ANYBODY WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD. UMBER JUST SIMPLY TRYING TO ALLOW THEM THE ABILITY. TO MANAGE THE FISH AND GAME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M PRETTY SURE NOT ONE OF THOSE COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. I'LL IS OUT THERE TRIED AT PUT TOXICS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT JUST A SIMPLE PRECAUTION. ARMED. A YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE THE CURRENT OPPOSITION IS TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE. BALL THERE'S A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THAT WAS ALSO BEFORE THE TERRACE. THAT ARE GOING ON WITH STILL AND. ALUMINUM THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THAT THOSE ARE MARKET MEASURES THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AS WELL. ON SO THAT MIGHT HAVE A HIGH HIGH IMPACT ON OTHER AMMUNITIONS. NOTCHED IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE NATION. AS WELL THIS IS JUST SIMPLY A SCHOOL. FOR. THE COMMISSION. AND AND QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THE COMMISSION WOULD NO BASS ON WHAT TO DO WITH THE STATE. I'M THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE TOOL FOR THEM TO USE JUST IN CASE WE HIT A POINT. IT'S NOT MANDATING IS NOT CHANGING THAT IT IS GIVING THE GOVERNOR APPOINTED COMMISSION. THE ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOBS. UP THANK YOU I I BELIEVE THOSE WHO IS MENTIONED THAT THE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WILDLIFE SERVICES DEPARTMENTS ALREADY CONVERTED TO ALL NON LEAD AND I THINK THAT. I'M. FOR THAT THEY ARE THE NUMBER ONE CONSUMER OF NON LET I I'D. I'D ATTENDED AN EMPRESS ACT YEAH THAT'S FOR COMMON CALIBERS GET YOU HAVE MUCH FOR COMING UP I'LL GIVE AWE. AYE AYE. BUT WOULD. A BUT I AM I'M NOT CUT WAS BORN THIS BILL RIGHT NOW BUT I'D OF RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO EXACTLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE IMPACTS. THAT DO OCCUR THAT SOMETIMES UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES APPEAL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IF THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL BILL HAD COME FORWARD OR WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH YOU. AS TO WHAT THE INTENT WAS BY DIGGING A FIVE YEAR LEAD IN WAS INTENTIONAL JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE OF ALLOWING THE MARKET AND. ALLOWING. THOSE THAT USE THE PRODUCTS TO ADJUST BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MANY OF QUESTIONS COMETS. SHELTER. HOW JUST GONNA SAY VERY QUICKLY AND? NO THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION DID ACTUALLY TASK. A IT WAS A COMMISSIONER THE DIRECTOR WITH LOOKING INTO THIS AND IF THERE WEREN'T AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES THAT HE WOULD HAVE A PROCESS. THEY WOULD DO THAT NOW. IN THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THAT IT WHAT IT DOES IS IT PUTS IT IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMISSION THE SAY LET THEM THEIR. THERE ARE CALIBERS OUT THERE WHERE THERE AREN'T SUFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE YET SO. AND I THINK ITS IN AND IT IS A. IN LINE WITH THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. AND I JUST PASS THEM TO DO THIS YOU KNOW PRIOR TO CERTAIN DAY BECAUSE THERE ARE CONSUMERS OUT THERE THAT THEY THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE. NEO NAM LET ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THEY AND THEY STILL WANT TO. KNOW HUNTON AND AND GO ABOUT. THAT RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE WOULD SO I I I I WOULD ASK THAT WE CONSIDER THIS IN AND PUSH IT THROUGH. I'M IN AND IT WOULDN'T BE. YOU KNOW. I DON'T THINK THAT IT IS THE IT DOESN'T INHIBIT THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOU DO HAVE A MOTION SECOND. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE A NO RECOMMENDATION AND DOM AND I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THAT ALTHOUGH. IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW MORE WORK. WITH THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR IS ONE OF THE. COMPONENTS TO. AND YOU KNOW A RECOMMENDATION. IDEA RECENTLY RECEIVED OF THE. STUDY THAT CAME BACK. THAT IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE SCHOOLS. DOT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. HEAD OUT A LEVEL ABOVE AND BEYOND. ACCEPTABLE WAIT. OF LEAD AND ALTHOUGH WE MAY BE TALKING ABOUT APPLES AND ORANGES THE JUSTICE OF THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT THE CHILDREN THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED BY THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME. I I WOULD ASK THAT THAT YOU KNOW THEIR BE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR THE BILL I CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO. SEEN SOME TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE YOU KNOW APPROACH TO THIS. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT TIME YOU KNOW WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. AGAIN BUT AT THIS TIME WE RECOMMEND YOU KNOW AND THE. THAT'S THE STAFF. RECOMMENDATION AS WELL SO. MEG CLOSE PLEASE. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS TOMORROW THE OPPOSITION. IN IN RELATION TO THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR ON THIS BILL WOULD NOT CHANGE THE BAN ON THOSE AREAS AT ALL. ARMS OF THIS COMMENTER. NOT GERMANE TO THIS LEGISLATION. THAT AGAIN I'D LIKE TO STRESS THE UNKNOWN MARKET WITH THE CURRENT TEAR SITUATION. IT AND ALSO I MEAN. AB. THREE ELEVEN SEVEN AS A MEASURE WHICH SEEKS TO ENSURE LAW ABIDING HUNTERS. ARE NOT PRECLUDED FROM LEGALLY TAKING WILDLIFE AND DEPRAVATION. AND OTHER PURPOSES. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB SEVERAL OF IN MAKING CALIFORNIA THE ONLY STATE REQUIRED TO USE NON LEAD AMMUNITION. FOR TAKING ALL OF WILDLIFE. WITH A FIRE. THE ELDER READ THROUGH THE AGES FOR AYE I THINK SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS NEED THE. TO KNOW THE FULL BACKGROUND. WITH THE SUBSEQUENT PASSAGE OF S. B.. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE IN PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR HUNTERS ARE NOT ABLE TO PURCHASE AMMUNITION OUT OF THE STATE. AND BRING IT BACK INTO. CALIFORNIA IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW. NOR WILL THEY BE ABLE TO PURCHASE AMMUNITION ONLINE OR BY. ANY MEANS UNLESS THEY GO THROUGH AN AUTHORIZED RETAILER. THE PROCESS IS ALSO VERY COSTLY. CURRENTLY SOME CALIFORNIA RETAILERS HAVE LIMITED SUPPLY OF NON LEAD AMMUNITION. AND COMMON CALIBERS. HOWEVER ONCE NOT LEAD AMMUNITION IS FULLY REQUIRED FOR THE TAKING. OF ALL WILDLIFE IN CALIFORNIA ON JULY. TWENTY NINETEEN NEXT YEAR DEMAND WILL FAR EXCEED THE SUPPLY OF MONEY CALIBERS. AB THREE ELEVEN SEVEN. WHAT ADDRESS THIS SERIOUS CONCERN BY ALLOWING? THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSIONER TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THIS IS ONLY A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION. BY. GOVERNOR APPOINTED OR. TO SUSPEND THE PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF LEAD AMMUNITION FOR THOSE CALIBERS THAT MAY BE REASONABLE A. UNAVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC. AGAIN MEMBERS LET ME BE CLEAR. WITH THIS MEASURE WE ARE NOT TRYING TO UNDO. BAKER RENDON'S A. B. SEVEN ELEVEN. RATHER WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. SOLUTION. THESE THREE PREVIOUS MEASURES HAVE PLACED WITHIN THE HUNTING AND RANCHING AND FARMING COMMUNITIES. ACROSS RURAL CALIFORNIA. JUST RECENTLY WE PASS LEGISLATION THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. ADDRESSING WHILE PICKS. ANOTHER PROBLEM WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF AMMUNITION FOR HUNTING. THIS IS A SEVERE PROBLEM. THE AN ABILITY TO PURCHASE PARTICULAR LOADS WILL RESULT IN DEPRAVATION. AND WILL HINDER HUNTERS FROM SEEKING TO APPLY. AND FILL TAX THIS IS ANOTHER PROBLEM A LOT OF THE STATE BUDGET FOR FISHING GAME COMES FROM THE CELL OF TAX. IF MONSTER OUT HUNDREDS ARE VERY SIMPLE GUYS. THE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE AMMO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HUNT. WHICH MEANS YOU'RE NOT GONNA BY THE TASK WHICH WAS THE STATE'S NOT GOING TO GET THE MONEY THAT I CAN GO TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. WHICH THE OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL REPRESENTS A IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. AGAIN WE'RE NOT SEEKING TO UNDO THE BAN. AS THE THREE YEAR SUNSET ON A. B.. THREE ELEVEN SEVEN. WE SIMPLY WANT TO GIVE THE COMMISSION THE AUTHORITY TO ENACT A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION SHOULD PARTICULATE CALIBERS. BE SEVERELY. UNAVAILABLE. AGAIN MEMBERS. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO. FIGURES DON WE'RE SIMPLY VERY VERY SIMPLY. TRIED TO MAKE SURE THE GOVERNOR'S. FISH AND GAME BOARD HAS THE ABILITY. TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT MAY COME UP WITH UNKNOWN FUTURE PROJECTIONS WITH THE TERRACE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON. I ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE THOSE. THANK YOU THE THERE'S A MOTION A SECOND BY MISTER BIGELOW AND MISTER GALLAGHER. KERRIGAN NATION IS NOW. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. EDUARDO GARCIA. GARCIA NO. GALLAGHER BY GALLAGHER AYE. BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE CARILLO. CHOI. CHOI AYE CHU. FRIEDMAN. GLORIA. HARPER BUT I HARPER AYE KALRA. KALRA NO. LEVINE. THE VINO. MATHIS BY. SIGH RUBIO. RUBIO NO SOLACE. WOULD. WOULD KNOW. THE ONLY BE YEAH COLOR. IF IT DOESN'T PASS MASTERY CONSIDERATIONS OF CAN CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION WITH THE SPEAKER SO I I I BELIEVE BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST HEARING. THAT WE WE MAY NOT. BE. IN A POSITION TO DO THAT BUT LET ME CHECK WITH. THE ACTUAL TECHNICAL. YEAH IT'S I THINK. IT'S THE LAST HEARING. LAST POLICY HEARING. WHO? LET'S KEEP THAT LET'S KEEP THAT THE ROLE OF AN. IN THEM THANK YOU MISTER. WHICH SOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WILL MOVE ON TO A LIGHTER SUBJECT. AND THAT'S MONARCHS IN CALIFORNIA. AS IT HAD A LONG MORNING I GUESS. SO IN THE EIGHTIES WE HAD PROBABLY TEN MILLION. OR SO THANK YOU MOTION AND MONARCHS ACROSS THE THE STATE CURRENT ESTIMATES AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND IN PART OF THE PROBLEM. IS THEY. THE HABITAT OF THE MONARCHS NEED TO TO BREED AND A LOT OF IT'S IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO AGRICULTURAL AND OTHER. TYPES OF USES BUT THERE'S AT THERE'S A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER A LOT OF THIS HABITAT. INTO THIS PROGRAM WOULD DO WOULD BE TO PUT SOME MONEY TO WORK WITH LANDOWNERS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO FACILITATE. MONARCH HABITAT. THIS IS CALLED THE. MONARCH AND POLLINATOR RESCUE PROGRAM HOW TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION MONARCHS ARE NOT GREAT POLLINATORS BUT IT DOES TURN OUT THAT THE HABITAT THAT THEY USE DOES. FACILITATE THEY A NUMBER OF SPECIES THAT ARE IN FACT POLLINATORS. THESE ARE ICONIC SPECIES THE MONARCHS ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST WHERE THEY COLLECT IN CYPRUS AND THEY COLLECTED PINES THEY ALSO COLLECT IN THE. THE NON NATIVE EUCALYPTUS TREES THAT ARE THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT BUT BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING SUCH SUCH DECLINES IN POPULATIONS I THINK IT'S VERY WORTH CREATING A PROGRAM PUTTING SOME MONEY THROUGH THE. WHAT WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH LANDOWNERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S NOT A MANDATORY PROGRAM BUT THOSE WHO ARE WILLING? TO TAKE THE MONEY TO WORK ON. RESTORING AND MANAGING HABITS AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR EITHER THINK YOU DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND THAT PLEASE PROCEED. MORE INITIATIVE CHAIRMAN CARCILLO VICE CHAIRMAN GALLAGHER MY NAME IS ERIC HOLST. ON THE BALLOT JUST AN ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR WORKING LANDS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND BASED IN SACRAMENTO. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF FOOD NAG. I'M HERE DOING TODAY TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY ONE THE A MONARCH BUTTERFLY IMPONER RESCUE PROGRAM. IT IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE TERM RESCUE MARKER ONCE ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE AND UBIQUITOUS. WILDLIFE SPECIES IN OUR STATE. THEY'RE FAMILIAR TO RESIDENTS OF THE CENTRAL COAST WHERE THEY SPEND THE WINTER. IN THE SPRING THEY FAN OUT FROM THE COAST AND READ IN FEE THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. FOOTHILLS IN THIS YEAR NEVADA. BUT AS OUR BREEDING HABITAT IS DECLINE THE NUMBERS FOR THE WESTERN POPULATION HAVE DECLINED AS WELL. THE P. PEAK POPULATION WAS MEASURED IN THE MILLIONS AND AS. MR STONE MENTION THIS WINTER THEY. THEY'RE DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH IS ACTUALLY DECLINE OF THIRTY PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR. A IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE WESTERN POPULATION IS DISTINCT FROM THE PERHAPS MORE FAMOUS BUT EQUALLY IMPERILED EASTERN POPULATION. THAT OVER WINTERS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CENTRAL MEXICO. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT MARK CAN RECOVER. THE CONCERTED EFFORT TO RESTORE THEIR BREEDING AND FEEDING HABITAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOOTHILLS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. THIS HABITAT CONSISTED OF A PRO INAPPROPRIATE BLEND OF WILD FLOWERS FLOWERING SHRUBS. GRASSES AND MILKWEED. MILK WEED IS THE KEY FOR MARK BECAUSE IT LAYS ES ITS EGGS EXCLUSIVELY ON THIS. YOU NEED PLAN AND HERE'S THE KICKER. ALSO AS A. ASSEMBLYMEMBER STAR MENTION THIS HAVE SAME HABITAT IS HOME TO. CALIFORNIA'S MOST ECONOMICALLY VALUABLE CLASS OF WILDLIFE NATIVE BEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS CRITICAL CONTRIBUTORS. TO CALIFORNIA'S NEARLY NEARLY FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. NATIVE BEES AND OTHER PARTNERS ARE SIMILARLY EXPERIENCING TROUBLING DECLINES PARTICULARLY IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES WHERE THEY PROVIDE THE MOST BENEFIT. IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT CROPS INCLUDING ALMOND STRAWBERRIES APPLES AVOCADOS KIWIS AND OTHERS DEPEND ON BEE POLLINATION. AND FINALLY AS WE MENTIONED BECAUSE OF THEIR DECLINE THE MONARCH AND A HANDFUL OF OTHER POLLINATORS ARE CANDIDATES FOR LISTING ON THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST. A STRONG EFFORT TO STIMULATE VOLUNTARY HABITAT ENHANCEMENT. WHO CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO AVOIDING LISTING? AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH OUR THE ECONOMIC COSTS THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH THAT LISTINGS OF THANK YOU AND I ARE JR. SIMPLE YOU AND THOSE WISHING TO LIVE ON THE RECORD SUPPORTING THE MEASURE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR A RECALL MUST WRITTEN ON IT WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT GETTING MY LETTER OF SUPPORT AND ON TIME BUT THIS IS A GREAT BILL. DRIVE OF.

THANK YOU SO WILL KEEP IT OPEN FOR THE MEMBERS AT ON WILL HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD REPRESENTS TWO BILLS AND THEN. SUMMER KALRA. CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AS YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT IS HOME TO SOME OF OUR STATES MOST SPECTACULAR STATE NATIONAL PARKS AS YOU ARE ALSO PROBABLY AWARE THERE ARE A FEW CANNABIS PLANTS GROWING IN THE SECONDS ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. JUST A FEW OF MY DISTRICT IS HOME TO THE EMERALD TRIANGLE THE HISTORICAL HEART OF THE NATION'S CANNABIS INDUSTRY. THE RUGGED REMOTE NATURAL NATURE OF THIS REGION COMBINED WITH THE AMPLE WATER SUPPLY MAKES THE EMERALD TRIANGLE AN IDEAL PLACE TO GROW CANNABIS UNDETECTED. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WAS ESTIMATED THE REGION PRODUCED OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY'S CANNABIS. WHILE MAJORITY THESE CANVAS FORMS ARE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS. TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE THE CASE. THAT EVERY EVERY YEAR DOZENS OF UNSUSPECTING HIKERS WEEKEND WARRIORS LAWN FORSMAN OFFICERS PARK PERSONNEL STUMBLE ACROSS A TETE A TRESPASS GROWS ON PUBLIC LAND. THESE CRIMINAL OPERATIONS RAFEAL ASSOCIATE WITH ORGANIZED CRIME NOVELS AND AN ALMOST ALWAYS HEAVILY ARMED. THE SITUATIONS BECOME SO DIRE THAT MOST FAMILIES IN MY DISTRICT WILL NOT VENTURE OUT TO THE PARKS DURING THE GROWING SEASON WHICH SPANS FROM LATE APRIL. THROUGH SEPTEMBER. THE SAME TIME PERIOD WHEN MOST OF US WERE LOOKING TO GET OUTSIDE AND UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS. AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE THE TENTS AIMS TO TAKE BACK OUR STATE PARKS. THE BILL WOULD WOULD DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION TO COLLABORATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO SURVEY THESE PUBLIC LANDS. IDENTIFY TRESPASSING GROWS AND COME UP WITH THE PLAN PUT THESE GUYS OUT OF BUSINESS AND CLEAN UP THE SITES. IT IS TRUE THERE ARE MANY TRESPASS GROWS ON PRIVATE LANDS AND I AGREED THAT ENVIRONMENTALLY MANY OF THESE SITES ARE AS ARE AS IMPORTANT IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT ECOLOGICALLY. BILLS BILLS IS NOT STAINED STE IS NOT AIMED AT STEERING GRANT MONEY AWAY FROM CLEANUP PROJECTS ON PRIVATE LANDS. OVER PRIVATE LANDS HAVE A LANDOWNER TO HELP IDENTIFY THESE TRESPASS GROWS AN ADVOCATE FOR THE CLEANUP. OUR PRIVATE LANDS OF REQUIRE OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE PUBLICLY YOUR PRIVATE. BLAMES REQUIRE PUBLIC AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY GROWS IN CREATIVE PLAN TO GET THEM CLEANED UP RIGHT AND RIGHT NOW THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ITS MAIN AS LIZ FORCED BURKE A PATH FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. GREAT CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ FORSBERG I'M HERE AT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHAT HAS CHAMPION THE EFFORT TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT FROM ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION WE GREATLY APPRECIATE HIS LEADERSHIP AND ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. AND TWO DOZEN FIFTEEN THE NATURE CONSERVANCY PUBLISHED A STUDY IN BIOSCIENCE THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPACTS OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION THE ENVIRONMENT. ILLEGAL GROWERS OFTEN TOP SMALL HEAD WATER STREAMS IN SUMMER TAKING WATER EXACTLY ONE FIFTY THAT THE MOST. ILLEGAL CANNABIS FARMING IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH I'M PERMITTED FORCED CLEAR CUTTING AND ROAD CONSTRUCTION WHICH CAN INCREASE EROSION DESTROYED HABITAT AND DAMAGE STREAMS. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IS HELPING MAKE SURE THAT REVENUE FROM PROP SIXTY FOUR IS DEDICATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO SPEND IS SPENT ON PREVENTING IMPACTS AND CLEANING UP FROM PAST DAMAGES FROM ILLEGAL CANNABIS CANNABIS PRODUCTION. WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE AND WE URGE OUR AYE VOTE. THOSE WISHING TO ADD ON SUPPORT. MARIAN WARMER DOWN BROKE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON ELEANOR TEAS ON BEHALF OF SAVE THE REDWOODS LEAGUE IN SUPPORT THINK YOU. ONE OF THEM AGAIN WITHOUT MY CALIFORNIA WOULDN'T GET A LOT OF SUPPORT AND BUT WE STRONG SUPPORT EUROPE EFFORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SEE NO ONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BIGELOW. TO THE AUTHOR ON. SPECIFICALLY CAN YOU ADDRESS HOW THIS. BILL WILL IMPACT. THE PRIVATE USES OF THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING IN ON PRIVATE LANDS. OR THE PUBLIC FUNDS UTILIZED FOR. STOPPING THEIR AN AND A RATTY KILLING THE ILLEGAL USE OF GROWS ON PRIVATE LANDS. THE FUNDS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE CURRENTLY ARE OUTLINED AS THOSE SAME FUND SO THE BE COMPETING INTERESTS. DO YOU BELIEVE. OR WILL YOU. CLARIFY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT HARMING ONE OVER THE OTHER. BY TED IS NOT TO HARM ONE OVER THE OTHER MOM BUT I MY INTENT IS TO FOCUS THAT ARE THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL IS ON ON ON PUBLIC LANDS. OKAY SO. MAYBE THROUGH THE CHAIR HOW CAN WE DETERMINE. SO THAT WE'RE NOT IMPACTING. THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING SUCCESSFULLY USED FOR THE. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TODAY. OVER THE OVER THE CANE THAT. THE AUTHOR IS RIGHTFULLY ASKING. TO BE ADDRESSED ITS A DIFFICULT ISSUE. AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN AUGMENTATION NEEDS TO OCCUR. IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WITHOUT HARMING. ANOTHER. MAYBE YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT OR MAYBE THE STAFF SOMEHOW. SOUNDS LIKE THAT SUB. APPROPRIATIONS ISSUE. THAT THAT YOU'LL BE YET WORKING ON I UNDERSTAND SUSPECT THIS IS A PROBLEM ORGAN PREPARATIONS ISSUE YES. AND AND AND. THROUGH THE CHAIR OF THESE ANSWERS BIGELOW I'VE BEEN STRONG FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND ADVOCATE FOR PROPER I'VE IT AND PUBLIC LAND PROTECTION SO THIS IS NOT NAY ANYWAY MEANT TO TAKE FROM WANT TO STEAL FROM ONE. TO GIVE TO ANOTHER IT'S JUST NOT IT'S AN OPPORTUNIST EIGHT NO LOOK WE NEED TO FOCUS HERE AND AND AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DO THAT. AT AS SOMEONE WHO WRECKED. RECOGNIZES AND HAS A LOT OF. LANDOWNERS WHO ARE IMPACTED NOW WHERE THEY CAN'T SAFELY GO OUT AND. I DO THEIR COMMON DAY PRACTICES FROM RANCHING TO. TO JUST GOING OUT AND ENJOYING THE LAND OUT OF FEAR. FROM ILLEGAL GROVES THAT EXIST ON THEIR PRIVATE LANDS. THAT ARE SET UP WITH GROOVY TRAPS PEOPLE WITH GUNS GUNS THAT ARE ILLEGAL. WHILE DEFINITIONS IN THE STATE TODAY. ARM. I JUST WOULD HATE TO SEE THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS. FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO. PROTECTING A RADICALLY THESE ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ON THE PRIVATE PLANS BE IMPACTED. BECAUSE I DON'T SEE WHERE THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THIS IS THAT. I'M WITH YOU HAVING ALSO. ALSO BEING ONE OF THOSE WHO REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF ACRE CENTER AND STATE PARKS LIKE YOURSELF. AND EMPOWER. AND PUBLIC LANDS. IT'S A REAL QUANDARY FOR BOTH OF US RIGHT BECAUSE THIS DOES EXIST AND WE'VE GOT A RADICALLY BOTH. I THINK WHAT WHAT THAT DID DISTINCTION I'M TRYING TO MAKE HERE IS THAT. THE PRIVATE LANDOWNER CAN. KEEP AN EYE ON THEIR OWN LAND THEY CAN MONITOR THEIR LAND LOOKED AT MORE. THEN. THE PUBLIC LANDS WE NEED SOMEONE TO ACTIVELY SURVEYED THE PUBLIC LANDS TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE. BECAUSE THEY'RE PUBLIC LANDS AND THEY AND THEIR OWN BY GOVERNMENT. BUT WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW AT LIKE IT'S AT YOUR PRIVATE LANDOWNER CAN. SURVEY THEIR OWN PUBLIC THEIR PRIVATE LAND AND THEY CAN YOU KNOW. MAKE REPORTS IN THE CAN BEFORE THAT BUT THERE'S NO ONE CURRENTLY TO AT THERE'S NO MECHANISM. TO MAKE SURE WE SURVEYED THE THE PUBLIC LANDS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M AFTER. OKAY SO MAYBE THAT THE COMPROMISE HERE IS MAYBE THE COMMITTEE COULD. ARE. RECOGNIZE THAT THIS CONFLICT DOES POTENTIALLY EXIST. I END THAT WE COULD RECOMMEND AS AGO SO APPROPRIATIONS THAT THERE BE. ARE A SERIOUS LOOK AT ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE ISN'T ANY HARM. THE COMFORTING US OUT OF THE LAST PERSON TO TURN AWAY AT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THE ONLY WAY TO GET THERE IS TO CHANNEL IT HERE IN POLICY TO HELP YOU RIGHT AND THIS IS HOW IT HAS TO HAPPEN. AND HAVE AND AND ON THE ODD DUCK IN HERE TRYING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. BEING A GOOD CONSERVATIVE BUT I'M ALSO SOMEBODY WHO'S A PREGNANT. THAT WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT THING IS DONE. HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU OKAY SO MISTER CHAIR WOULD WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK AND HELP. YES SIR THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. PROJECT CLOSE.

THE THESE THESE FISH WERE ONCE A BUN ABUNDANT IN THE UPPER KLAMATH BASIN OF OREGON IN CALIFORNIA AND A SIGNIFICANT FOOD SOURCE FOR NATIVE PEOPLES. UNFORTUNATELY DUE IN LARGE PART TO HABITAT LOSS THE SUCKER PITCHER NOW A FULLY PROTECTED SPECIES UNDER STATE LAW. THE SHORT NO SUCKER FISH IS MUCH SMALLER SPECIES OF SACRIFICIAL ONLY REACHING TWENTY INCHES IN LENGTH BUT EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE BY THEIR LARGE HEADS AND DEEPLY NOTS LOWER LIPS. THE SUCKERS ARE NOW A FULLY ALSO FULLY PROTECTED SO AS SPECIES. THE BILL WOULD GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WHILE THAT THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO PROTECT THESE TO ENDANGERED SPECIES A SUCKER FISH.

BUT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY DUE TO THE FULLY PROTECTED STATUS OF THAT TO FISH SPECIES AND AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION.

APPROPRIATIONS NOW IT HAS A FIRST AND SECOND. AND. HERE AT GREAT PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE OF THE OPTION PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN TODAY AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN PROMOTE THE CONSERVATION OF MIGRATORY BIRDS. ARE PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO INDUSTRY ON COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS PROTECTING MIGRATORY BIRDS. THIS YEAR'S THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY THE SIGNING OF THE FEDERAL MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES CANADA MEXICO JAPAN AND RUSSIA. TO PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS THE MBTA'S ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND IS CREDITED WITH HELPING TO SAVE ICONIC BIRD SPECIES INCLUDING. THE WOOD DUCK BALD EAGLE SNOWY EGRET AND THE SANDHILL CRANE. MIGRATORY BIRDS ARE ESSENTIALLY CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL HISTORY ABOUT DIVERSITY AND ECONOMY. DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THE MBTA MOST MIGRATORY BIRD SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE IN DECLINE LARGELY DUE TO A LOSS OF HABITAT. AND DIRECT IMPACTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY. IN NORTH AMERICA AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY TWO BIRD SPECIES MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF BIRDS THAT OCCUR ON THE CONTINENT ARE AT RISK OF. A HIGH RISK OF EXTINCTION WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CONSERVATION ACTION. IN CALIFORNIA MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SPECIES OF BIRDS ARE AT SIGNIFICANT RISK. TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND MIGRATORY BIRDS WILL FACE EVEN GREATER CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE. AS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION GROWS INDUSTRIES CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE CLIMATE CHANGES AND RESOURCES BECOME SCARCER. UNFORTUNATELY RECENT ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE BEEN AIMED AT WEAKENING THE MBTA ALARMING CONSERVATIONISTS AND CREATING UNCERTAINTY. FROM REGULATED INDUSTRIES. AND DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR IN A MOVE THAT CONTRADICTED A HUNDRED YEARS A FEDERAL POLICY. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ISSUED ISRAEL LEGAL OPINION SAYING IT WOULD NO LONGER ENFORCE THE MBTA IN CASES OF INCIDENTAL BIRD DEATHS. EFFECTIVELY ALLOWING INDUSTRY TO KILL MILLIONS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS OUT THE NEED TO IMPLEMENT MEDIC MEDICATION MEASURES OF THE PAY FINES WERE LARGE SCALE KILLINGS OF BIRDS OCCUR. UNFORTUNATELY WE LIVE IN A TIME WHERE ACTIONS LIKE THESE ARE BECOMING THE NORM MORE STATES ARE HAVING TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN ACTIONS. TO KEEP IN PLACE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FOR WILDLIFE THEY'RE UNDER THREAT. BY THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. AS FEDERAL ROLE BUCK ROLLBACKS THE MBTA HAVE CREATED A VACUUM AND WILDLIFE PROTECTION CERTAINTY IS NEEDED FOR BOTH CONSERVATION EFFORTS. AND INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT BIRDS AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES ARE PROTECTED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AM I BOAT AND WITH ME TODAY AS WITNESSES ARE MY CLIENTS DIRECTOR POLICY BROUGHT UPON CALIFORNIA. AND KIM DELFINO STATE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MIKE LINES IN THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FRAUD ON CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. AND IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER INDICATED WE'RE HERE TO URGE AND I. FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BIRDS IS ALSO TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR COMPLIANCE FOR INDUSTRIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO MINIMIZE AND AVOID THEIR IMPACTS. THE MIGRATORY BIRDS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD QUITE A BIT OF TESTIMONY TODAY ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS NOW IMPORTANCE BOTH ECOLOGICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY AND INTRINSICALLY. TO CALIFORNIA'S BIODIVERSITY. SO I JUST WANT TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THE MIGRATORY BIRDS ARE IN DECLINE WILSON OF THE PROTECTIONS WORK. AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO THROUGH THIS BILL IS INCENTIVIZE PROTECTIONS TO BE PUT IN PLACE AND TO CONTINUE. TO BE CLEAR CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW PROHIBITS THE TAKING OF NON GAME MIGRATORY BIRDS BUT LACKS AWAY FOR INDUSTRY IT COULD OTHER ENTITIES TO COMPLY. AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN WOULD PROVIDE THAT PATH FORWARD. AS YOU SOME REMEMBER INDICATED CALIFORNIA MUST NOW STEP UP AS THE FEDERAL BILL REAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ROLLED BACK IT'S PROTECTIONS OF THE MBTA AND EFFECTIVELY GOT AT THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS LAWS ON THE BOOKS BUT IT NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO MOVE FORWARD IN AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN PROVIDES A PATH FORWARD. A COUPLE MORE POINTS I JUST WANNA MAKE ON IT IS ONE THAT AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. RATHER IT PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR ENTITIES TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAW. AND IF THEY WANT TO THE NAY WILL IMPLEMENT THOSE BMPS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY DFW AND IT WELL SELF CERTIFY THAT IT'S WITHIN COMPLIANCE. WE WROTE THIS TO MINIMIZE THE BURDEN TO DFW AND TO MIMIC A PROCESS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHICH SOUGHT A GENERAL PERMIT UNDER THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT. WITH THAT I'D WANT TO WRAP UP BY JUST SAYING THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH INDUSTRY TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE LANGUAGE AND ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. WE WILL CONTINUE THAT PROCESS GOING FORWARD. WE'RE ADDRESSING ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE RELATED TO THE SCALE OF THE IMPACTS SOUGHT TO US OR TO BE REGULATED BY THE BMPS. THE TIMING AND REPORTING ISSUES AND REQUIREMENTS. WITH THAT I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON A KIM DELFINO WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE. I'LL JUST MAKE THIS QUICK BECAUSE I THINK MIKE UP COVERED A LOT OF THE POINTS I THINK THE OF WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT WHEN THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT. WAS INTERPRETED BY THE FISH FISH WILDLIFE SERVICE AS PROHIBITING INCIDENTAL TAKE IT REALLY TRUE DROVE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE INDUSTRIES WORKED WITH THE SERVICE AND OTHERS TO COME UP WITH VARIOUS GUIDELINES. FOR EXAMPLE THE NGUYEN GUIDELINES THE. COMMUNICATION TOWER SITING GUIDELINES AND THE AVIAN POWERLINE GUIDELINES INDUSTRY DID THIS BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT THEY. WERE RISKING A BY NOT A PRO ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POTENTIAL. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR PROJECTS THAT WERE RESULTING IN INCIDENT TAKE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPPING BACK NOW AND REVERSING A HUNDRED YEARS OF LAW. AND SAY NO LONGER DOES THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT PROHIBIT INCIDENTAL TAKE THEY HAVE NOW REMOVED ANY INCENTIVE TO CONTINUE THAT COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. I'M AS MR LINES ALREADY POINTED OUT. THE CALIFORNIA CODE ALREADY CONTAINS A PROHIBITION ON INCIDENTAL TAKE OF MIGRATORY BIRDS BUT IT DIDN'T DO ANY MORE THAN THAT. AND FOR MANY YEARS DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE ESSENTIALLY DEFERRED TO THE US FISH WILDLIFE SERVICE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TO ESSENTIALLY TAKE CARE OF THE MIGRATORY BIRDS IN THAT SETTING. BUT NOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA PARTNER FISHING WHILE IT DOES HAVE TO SET UP AND THEN STAND P AND THAT THIS PRACTICE BILLS SET UP A PROCESS. THAT CONTINUES THAT COLLABORATIVE DROPPED COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. UP PROCESS BY ALLOWING FOR SELF CERTIFICATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE GUIDELINES AND SO IT ACTUALLY GIVES A PLACE FOR BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AND INDUSTRY AND STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES AGAIN IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER. AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE BELIEVE THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH AN UNFORTUNATE PROBLEM THAT HAS NOW BEEN PLACED AT THE FEET OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH A FEDERAL ROLE BACK. ON AND AGAIN WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE MOVES FORWARD TO ADDRESS WHAT OF THEIR ADDITIONAL CONCERNS ARE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A VERY WORKABLE. A PROCESS I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT DEPREDATION PERMITS I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE A INTENDED MAKING IT HARD. TO GET DEPREDATION PERMITS AT ALL ON AND SO I THINK THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE VERY EASILY ADDRESSED SO FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD URGE HER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THOSE WISHING TO ADD ON SUPPORT ACT HOW JOHNSON CIRCLE CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. RICOH MUSTARD UNATO WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND AND SUPPORT ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE GYRE INSTITUTE'S SEVENTH GENERATION INSTITUTE. WHICH TOYO SHOE MASH FOUNDATION PLASTIC POLL CUP PLASTIC POLLUTION COALITION AND CENTER FOR OCEANIC AWARENESS RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. AND A BIRD LOVERS EVERYWHERE. JEFFREY GOLDBERG WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. WE'RE GOING TO NEED FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT. ONE OF THE ME DOWN ON BEHALF OF A SUIT. CALIFORNIA RELIEF LATINO OUTDOORS AND IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. THAT DIDN'T BETH AGAIN THOUGHTS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. HELLO GUYS ARE WITH HIM THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND IN SUPPORT. RIGHT THOSE. WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. TO US SPEAKERS TWO MINUTES EACH SHOP OR LAST. YEAR THAT HE MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION I'M ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT OF A TWEENER. WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL OPPOSE POSITION BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH HOW THIS BILL MAY IMPACT TO OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ON THIS BILL WE DID SEND THE MULLIN OF A CONCERN. ABOUT THE DISCUSSION SO FAR HAVE BEEN GOOD WE THINK WE CAN GET THERE THANK YOU. CURRENT GOOD AFTERNOON WELL CREAMERS OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. A CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE AND PARTICULARLY FOR BIRDS I'M. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY GRASSLANDS ACTUALLY ARE THE NUMBER ONE TIME HABITAT FOR WINTERGREEN RAPTORS. AND WE ALSO PROVIDE RICE FIELD HAVE HALF PROVIDE HALF OF THE NUTRITION FOR. WINTERING WATERFOWL SO I'M. ALL OF THIS HABITAT THEN DOES PUT OUR MEMBERS AT RISK FOR VIOLATING PROHIBITIONS ON TAKE. WHEN THEY'RE MANAGING THEIR FARMS AND RANCHES. SO. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASE IN LIABILITY THAT THIS BILL WILL CREATE FOR POTENTIAL TAKE WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT THE BILL LAYS OUT. A. IN IN THE INTERIM TIME BEFORE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE DEVELOPED WE THINK THAT AND THE DEPARTMENT COULD STOP CERTAIN ACTIVITIES I'M WE KNOW THAT TIMBER HARVEST WHEN THEY ARE TURNING THEIR TEACH PEACE IF THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE. THEY. WILL ESSENTIALLY HOLD THOSE PERMITS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT AN INCREASING THE DEPARTMENT'S WORKLOAD A THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IS GOOD IS CONSIDERING A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET. BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO FULFILL THEIR EXISTING RESPONSIBILITIES AND SO ADDING AN ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY WHILE WORK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUND. EXISTING RESPONSIBILITIES SEEMS CHALLENGING WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH DEPREDATION PERMITS BUT I KNOW SOME OTHER COLLEAGUES OF MINE. AND WILL BE MENTIONING THOSE SO AT THIS POINT WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JUST AN OLD FIELD WITH CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION. OR ONE WHO. CORRELATE OUR REMARKS WITH THOSE MADE BY THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU UP BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT ONE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY. SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. WE DO HAVE SOME SOME CONCERNS THEY ARE VALID CONCERNS I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY WAY TO RECTIFY THOSE CONCERNS YET AS IT RELATES TO DEPREDATION PERMITS. MIGRATORY BIRDS TO GIVE THE BUZZARDS RAVENS CAN ACTUALLY AT A PRETTY CATTLE. AND WE HAVE SEEN INCREASE INSTANCES TO WEAR. PARTICULARLY PREYING ON ON SMALLER CABS EATING OUT THEIR EYES ARE OPEN WOUNDS. AND SO. WE CAN CURRENTLY GET. DEPREDATION PERMITS UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW. THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PUT A DUPLICATIVE PROCESS ON TOP OF THAT A WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND AGAIN I DO WANT TO SAY ALSO AS WELL WE JUST SAW THESE AMENDMENTS A MID PART OF LAST WEEK I'D SO I KNOW THAT OUR COMMENTS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BUT. WE DID I DID SUBMIT CONCERNS AND ARE HAPPY TO SPEAK TO THE AUTHOR BUT AT THIS POINT TIME WOULD ASK. FOR OPPOSED THE BILL THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON UP MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME SHANNON ANY I'M REPRESENTING A LARGE SCALE SOLAR ASSOCIATION. WHERE WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED OPPOSITION ON THIS AND I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MBTA ENFORCEMENT IF YOU IF YOU ALLOW IT FOR JUST A MOMENT? OF THIS BILL IS ENDEAVORING TO ENFORCE AN INTERPRETATION OF THE MBTA. THAT IS MORE STRINGENT THAN THAN HAS BEEN OPINED AND AND I AND A COUPLE OF AND ACTUALLY TREATS DIFFERENT CIRCUIT COURTS INCLUDING THE NIGHT CIRCUIT. WHICH IS CALIFORNIA'S OUR COURT OF APPEALS. WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ANGST UM ABOUT THE FEDERAL ROLLBACKS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON FEDERALLY TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ROLLBACKS BUT WE FEEL LIKE THIS BILL GOES A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR. THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING SWINGING BACK TOO FAR FOR THAT FOR THE. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MBTA. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW YOU THE US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE HAS IMPLEMENTED TAKE. EVEN BEFORE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TOOK OVER. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THEY SAID THAT PROSECUTIONS FOR MBTA VIOLATIONS ARE RESERVED FOR CASES WHERE COMPANIES ARE AWARE THEIR ACTIVITIES BECAUSE TAKE BUT NONETHELESS FAILED TO IMPLEMENT REASONABLE MEASURES TO AVOID MINIMISE AND MITIGATE HARM. NOW IN CALIFORNIA SEEK FOR PROVIDES FOR THAT. AND ONE OF THAT WERE. AND AND SO ALL OF OUR PROJECTS CERTAINLY ARE FOLLOWING SEQUEL WE AVOID WE MINIMIZE WE MITIGATE FOR NTTA SPECIES CURRENTLY. WHICH LEADS US TO QUESTION WHY WE'RE PUTTING THIS BILL FORWARD RIGHT NOW KNOW WHAT THE CIRCUIT COURTS HAVE DECIDED IS THE MBTA APPLIES TO HUNTING IT APPLIES TO TO PURPOSE WILL TAKE BUT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO INCIDENTAL TAKE. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AGREES WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING SOME ISSUES ARE WHAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE IMPROPERLY IMPROPERLY. APPLIED IN CALIFORNIA JUST QUICKLY BY THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE SEEK IS NUMBER ONE THAT ONLY THE ACTIVITIES KNOWN. TO CAUSE YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT HARM TO SPECIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE BILL. NUMBER TWO BMPS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED A THROUGH CONSENSUS BAKE A CONSENSUS BASED PROCESS. A PARTY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SELF CERTIFY AND THE BILL SHOULD CLARIFY AND I THINK THE WORLD POINTED TO THIS AS WELL BILL SHOULD CLARIFY THAT I'M TAKE IS ALLOWED UNTIL BE INFUSER DEVELOP BANK YOU. THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS JACOB LOS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION. PER SOLAR AND ETF RENEWABLES AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ECHO AND. ELYSEES COMMENTS AND HIGH STICKING TO THE OTHERS OFFICE FOR BEING WILLING TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH US ON THE BILL AS WE. MOVE FORWARD IN THE PROCESS THANK. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK TO DICING QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. SOME MEMBER RUBIO. YES I I'VE HEARD A LOT OF CONCERNS AND I'M HOPING THAT. YOU CAN WORK WITH THE THE. OPPOSITION TO CLARIFY SOME OF THESE ISSUES. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T. AND THERE'S NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH THIS IF YOU CAN YOU KNOW. ASSURE ME THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TYPE WHICH. SUPPORT BILL. OF THE THINK MISTER SHARON THANK YOU MISS RUBIO ASSEMBLY RUBIO I'M ABSOLUTELY AND I'VE BEEN. A PARTICULAR BUT SOME OF THE THE LAST COMMENTS HAVE BEEN PROPONENT OF ENERGY PROGRAM DECADE NOW AND CERTAINLY DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO HINDER. THE INDUSTRY. UNDER TRADITIONAL MBTA THAT NOBLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT HAS EXPANDED QUICKLY IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T SEE WHAT I CAN CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE. ARM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WILK TINA BROKE WITH THEM AS AS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION INCLUDING FROM THE CABS ASSOCIATION OTHER SAID THAT THEY JUST CAME KIND OF LATE. IN THE COMMENTS SO THEY WERE IN THE. IN THE REPORT. WHOEVER COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS THE REAL GOAL HERE IS TO ENSURE THAT. WE DON'T. THAT THE. THAT THE MBTA CONTINUE. TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA AS IT HAS FOR A HUNDRED YEARS WITH OF MODERNIZATION WHICH REALLY ALLOWS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY. TO HELP THEM. TO HELP PUT TOGETHER BEST MANAGER PRACTICE TO ALLOW THEM TO SELF CERTIFY OF SOME REALLY GREAT BENEFITS FOR INDUSTRY BUT WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GO BACKWARDS. AND TO REVERT TO. SOBRE MOVE INCIDENTAL BIRD DEATHS. OF OF FROM ENFORCEMENT ALTOGETHER THAT THAT BE A MASSIVE STEP BACKWARDS IN TERMS OF DETECTION OF BIRDS AND SO. I AM CONFIDENT THAT MOST OF THE FOLKS OF INDUSTRY THAT HAVE SPOKEN. BUT AGREE AHEAD THAT WE STILL NEED THE PROTECTION SUMMERED MBTA IN PLACE AND A SENSE AS A STATE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE HE PROPOSED PROTECTIONS AND IN PLACE NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IS RELAXING THEM THAT WE CAN DO IT AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM BUT INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT. THEIR CONCERNS I AM YOU KNOW A CAN BE NOT JUST HEARD THAT BUT TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE MATT AS IT WAS BUILT MOST FORWARD. NO QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS ITEM. WE DO HAVE MUCH A SECOND. MUCH KALRA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS THAT MEASURE FORWARD. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THAT. THE CONCERNS FROM THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES.
