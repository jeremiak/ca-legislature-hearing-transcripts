RELATIONSHIP WITH PROFESSORS.

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:10.467
AND THEY CAN ALSO NOT MAINTAIN

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.102
THEIR EDUCATION AND THE SAME WAY

00:56:12.168 --> 00:56:13.837
ABOUT THE CLIENT HOUSING IS AN

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.872
INTEGRAL PART OF BASS BUT ALSO

00:56:15.939 --> 00:56:17.941
THE WAY IN WHICH WE CHOOSE TO

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:18.742
OPERATE THE INSTITUTION AND

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:21.478
EXPAND ITS OVERALL CAPACITY. IS

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:24.047
ALSO A MAJOR PART OF BASS. BUT

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:25.849
IF WE WANT TO CHOOSE TO DO THIS

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:27.851
I ASK BUT WE ALSO CONSIDER WHAT

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:29.419
WE CAN DO TO BE PROACTIVE RATHER

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:30.954
THAN REACTIVE. MANY OF THE

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.789
RESOURCES BY OUR CAMPUSES WORK

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:34.090

SUPPLEMENT A STUDENTS INCOME OR

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:40.563
LACK OF INCOME TO AFFORD RENTS.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:43.032
HOWEVER THIS IS NOT ENOUGH IF WE

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:44.934
SIMPLY CHOOSE TO BE REACTIVE WE

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:47.837
WILL NEVER GET TO THE HEART OF

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:49.205
THE ISSUE. THE HEART OF THE

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:51.341
ISSUE IS LACK OF HOUSING IN OUR

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:54.811
COMMUNITY THE HEART. IS THE

00:56:54.878 --> 00:56:57.647
HEART OF THE ISSUE IS THE LACK

00:56:57.714 --> 00:56:59.382

I ASKED BUT WE TRY TO MAKE THIS

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.224
MORE ACCESSIBLE BY ENSURING THAT

00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:09.759

STUDENTS TO LIVE AND- ARE NOT.

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.328
INFERIOR TO THE WAY THAT WE

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:13.963
WOULD ASK OUR REGULAR CITIZENS

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.665

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.404
IN MIND RECOMMEND THE

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.171
LEGISLATURE START WEIGHING THESE

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.273
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES AGAINST

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:38.974
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL.

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:41.010
AN ATTORNEY WHICH ONE OF WHICH

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:43.045
OPTIONAL LINES WITH ITS

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:45.214
OBJECTIVES FOR THE A PROGRAM.

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:47.650
NOW NOTE THAT YOU'LL VERY LIKELY

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.818
HEAR A LOT OF IDEAS IN TERMS OF

01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:50.786
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES THAT YOU

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.755
COULD TAKE. WE OFFER SOME

01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:54.790
ALTERNATIVE IDEAS ON PAGES SEVEN

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.692
AND EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA. AND

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:58.661
THEN STAFF OFFER SOME ADDITIONAL

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:01.030
IDEAS ON PAGE TEN. AND I SUSPECT

01:10:01.096 --> 01:10:03.098
YOU'LL HEAR EVEN A SOME

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:04.266
ADDITIONAL- IDEAS FROM THE

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:06.168
SEGMENTS. AS YOU'RE GOING

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:08.137
THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS-

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:09.705
YOU KNOW FUNDAMENTALLY IT MIGHT

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:11.106
BE HELPFUL TO START WITH WHAT

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:12.975
ARE THE GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.209
IF THE GOALS ARE SOLELY ABOUT

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:15.711
IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY THE

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:18.280
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. IS A

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:19.915
STARTING POINT TO GET THEIR- IF

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.350
YOU HAVE MANY OTHER OBJECTIVES

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.252
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO FOCUS

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:25.154
IN AREAS THAT HAVE HIGH HOUSING

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:27.756
SHORTAGES IN HIGH DEMAND. OR IF

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:30.359
YOUR FOCUS IS ON ENROLLMENT

01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:31.093
CAPACITY. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.495
YOU COULD MODIFY THE

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.731
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:36.365
MORE EXPLICITLY CONSIDER THOSE

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.100
FACTORS. SO AGAIN IT'S REALLY

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:39.702
GOING TO. FALL ON WHAT YOUR

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:42.137
PRIORITIES ARE FOR- FOR THIS

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:44.006
PROGRAM. HEY CAN HAPPY DURING

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.775
THE CUNY TO ELABORATE MORE ON

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:47.876
ANY IDEAS THAT YOU'RE THINKING

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:49.645
ABOUT. OUR SECOND SET OF

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:52.081
COMMENTS ARE AROUND THE VARIOUS

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:55.084
PROGRAM RISKS THAT- WE THINK ARE

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:57.620
PRESENT IN THIS PROGRAM. NOW ALL

01:10:57.686 --> 01:11:00.122
CAPITAL OUTLAY- PROJECTS COME

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.790
WITH SOME RISKS YOU KNOW THEY

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:02.925
COME WITH THE RISK OF HAVING

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.960
COST OVERRUNS COMING IN AT A

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:06.395
DIFFERENT SCOPE OR HAD FACING

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.230
IMPLEMENTATION DELAYS. WE THINK

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:09.331
THESE RISKS ARE PARTICULARLY

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:11.233
SALIENT IN THIS PROGRAM FOR TWO

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.302
REASONS ONE IS THAT CAMPUSES

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:15.904
GENERALLY HAVE LESS EXPERIENCE-

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:16.972
CONSTRUCTING OF AFFORDABLE

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:18.340
HOUSING. AND THIS IS

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:19.408
PARTICULARLY TRUE THE COLLEGES

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:23.879
THAT HAVE. LITTLE EXPERIENCE-

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:24.813
ONE THING HOUSING PROGRAMS

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.751
GENERALLY. AND THEN SUDDENLY-

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.719
CUT COST OVERRUNS SCOPE CHANGES

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:34.556
COULD PUT THE STATE LEGISLATURE

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:37.426
DIFFICULT POSITION. ON MAY COULD

01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:39.094
PUT PRESSURE ON THE CAMPUSES TO

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:40.396
ALTER THEIR SCOPES R OR

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.797
INCREASE THE PROPOSED RENTS

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.032
THEREBY UNDERMINING THE GOALS OF

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:44.800
THE PROGRAM OR COULD PUT

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:45.968
PRESSURE ON THE STATE TO PROVIDE

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:48.203
ADDITIONAL FUNDING- TO HELP

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.472
COVER THESE COST OVERRUNS.

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:52.174
KEEPING THIS IN MIND WE

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:53.075
RECOMMEND A THREE STATUTORY

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.077
CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM THAT WE

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:56.979
THINK WILL HELP MITIGATE SOME OF

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:58.213
THESE RISKS. AGAIN FOR THE SAKE

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.782
OF TIME I WON'T GO THROUGH THEM

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:01.083
AND BIG DETAIL DURING MY

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.851
TESTIMONY BUT HAPPY TO ELABORATE

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.487
MORE ON THE Q. AND A- BUT THE

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:06.121
FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT THERE'S

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:06.655
FUNDING FOR CONTINGENCY.

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:07.222
ESTABLISHING A NOTIFICATION

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:08.490
PROCESS FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHEN

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:10.426
THERE ARE NOTABLE SCOPE CHANGES.

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.828
AND ALSO ENHANCING SOME OF THE

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:13.395
PROGRAMS EXISTING REPORTING

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:16.165
REQUIREMETS. FOR OUR FINAL SET

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:17.032
OF COMMENTS OR AROUND THE

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:19.468
VARIOUS PRIVATE HIGHER EDUCATION

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:20.069
PRIORITIES LEGISLATORS FACING

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:23.772
THIS YEAR- AS YOU AS THIS

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.140
COMMITTEE IS DISCUSSED MANY

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:26.542
TIMES THEY'RE STILL SUBSTANTIAL

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:27.876
AMOUNT OF UNMET FINANCIAL NEED

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.812
AT THE SEGMENTS PARTICULARLY AT

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.046
THE CAL STATE IN THE COMMUTER

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:32.815
COLLEGE SYSTEMS. AND THAT'S JUST

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.249
BECAUSE OF THE GAP BETWEEN

01:12:34.316 --> 01:12:35.284
EXISTING FINANCIAL AID SPENDING

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.820
AND THE LEVEL OF FINANCIALLY

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.021
THAT EXISTS FOR LOW INCOME

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:41.557
STUDENTS. EVEN ONCE ALL THESE

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:43.192
GRANTS ARE ALLOCATED THAT

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:44.293
AFFORDABILITY GAP WILL STILL

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:45.961
REMAIN. ADDITIONALLY THE

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.163
LEGISLATURE IS ALSO FACING MANY

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:49.932
ISSUES WITH ACADEMIC FACILITIES

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.533
AT THE SEGMENTS RELATED TO

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.768
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SEISMIC

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.536
SAFETY ISSUES THIS COMMITTEE HAS

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:56.472
DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE MANY TIMES.

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:58.707
AND THIS ISSUE WILL REMAIN EVEN

01:12:58.774 --> 01:12:59.808
AFTER THE GRANTS ARE FULLY

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.276
ALLOCATED. GIVEN ALL THESE

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.544
COMPETING ISSUES WE RECOMMEND

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:03.912
THE LEGISLATURE START THINKING

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:05.714
ABOUT WHICH OF THESE AREAS ARE

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:07.382
AMONG THE TIRES PRIORITIES. AND

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.517
REALLY FOCUS ITS RESOURCES ON

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:11.086
ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES OVER THE

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:12.921
NEXT COUPLE YEARS. THANK YOU

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:14.490
THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS HAPPY TO

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.825
ELABORATE MORE IN Q. NAY. OKAY

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:19.695
THANK YOU NOW LET'S HEAR FROM

01:13:19.762 --> 01:13:21.096
OUR- THREE SEGMENTS WHAT WE'LL

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.699
START WITH OUR COMMUNITY

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.467
COLLEGES. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:27.002
MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.403
BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE WAS EVER

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.805
AT- EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:30.939
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.541
SUCCESS OF THE CALIFORNIA ME

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.910
COLLEGES OVER THE PAST DECADE

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.578
HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN ON THE

01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:38.514
RISE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.982
UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA MEAN

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:41.917
COLLEGES STUDENTS ARE OVER

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:43.018
REPRESENTED IN THE HOUSING

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:45.020
CRISIS AS OUR STUDENT LEADER

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.756
SHARED THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.658
THREE A STATE BUDGET PRESENTS AN

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:50.859
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS- THE

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:52.394
HOUSING CRISIS WHILE ALSO

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:54.463
PROVIDING AFFORDABILITY HOUSING

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:57.299
WITH DIGNITY AND A COMMITMENT TO

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.034
EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS. FURTHER YET

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.602
IT'S ANOTHER STRATEGY TOWARD

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.671
STUDENT SUCCESS ON AVERAGE OUR

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:05.707
STUDENTS SPEND FOURTEEN THOUSAND

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:06.742
FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.644
DOLLARS PER YEAR ON HOUSING

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:10.279
THAT'S TEN TIMES MORE THAN THEY

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:12.881
SPEND ON TUITION AND FEES.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.383
CURRENTLY TWELVE ME COLLEGES

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:16.518
ACROSS THE SYSTEM HAVE STUDENT

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:19.822
HOUSING AND WE HAVE CAPACITY FOR

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:22.057
TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:22.691
FIFTY BEDS THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.626
THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS ACROSS

01:14:24.693 --> 01:14:28.330
THE STATE. THE PROPOSED- AND

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:31.099
ELIGIBLE HOUSING- PROGRAMS ARE

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:33.635
PROJECTS THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:36.171
YOU BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:37.573
COULD MORE THAN DOUBLE THE

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.374
STUDENT HOUSING THAT WE HAVE

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:41.944
ACROSS OUR SYSTEM SO WE THINK.

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:42.911
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:46.215
CONSIDER INVESTMENTS THIS YEAR.

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:47.683
EFFORTS TO BUILD A HOLISTIC

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:49.985
STUDENT HOUSING NEEDS FRAMEWORK

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:52.921
MUST INCLUDE A ROBUST FOCUS ON

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.224
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND THAT

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.192
IS A KEY DISTINCTION WITHIN THE

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:58.861
PROJECT THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:00.062
FORM FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:02.264
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO WE

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.966
SUGGEST THE BUILDING ON THE ONE-

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.968
BILLION COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:07.369
HOUSING AT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:09.905
COLLEGES- THAT WE RESPECTFULLY

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:12.574
ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. OF

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.376
AWARDING THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:16.078
PROPOSED TO YOU I'M BY THE

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:18.513
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT ALSO-

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.816
AND THOSE INCLUDE- FIVE PROJECTS

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:22.718
ASSIST USE FRESNO IMPERIAL

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:25.487
SIERRA AND VENTURA. BUT WE ALSO

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.823
ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:29.725
THE ELIGIBLE PROJECTS THAT THOSE

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:32.160
CAN MOVE FORWARD NOW- SO THAT

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:34.363
YOU CAN PREVENT COST ESCALATION

01:15:34.429 --> 01:15:35.964
AND HELP US REACH THAT GOAL OF

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:37.532
MORE THAN DOUBLING THE STUDENT

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:39.334
HOUSING AVAILABLE ACROSS OUR

01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:41.904
SYSTEM. THAT WOULD MEAN FUNDING

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:43.672
FOR A AND BAKERSFIELD COLLEGE OF

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:45.741
THE CANYONS COMPTON BECAUSE SOME

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:47.609
THIS RIVER LAKE TAHOE NAPA AND

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:50.479
SANTA ROSA- SEVERAL OF THOSE

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:51.780
THAT HAVE BEEN FIRE AFFECTED

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:53.782
AREAS ACROSS OUR STATE

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.050
STRUGGLING WITH HOUSING

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:57.552
GENERALLY. THE PROPOSED AN

01:15:57.619 --> 01:16:00.088
ELIGIBLE COULD ENSURE THAT WE

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:03.325
ARE MOVING FASTER AND- MORE

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:06.061
EFFICIENTLY TOWARDS BUILDING-

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:08.196
HOUSING ACROSS OUR SYSTEM IN

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:09.631
BUILDING THAT CAPACITY TO

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:10.933
ADDRESS BASIC NEEDS AND

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:14.636
AFFORDABILITY. WE ALSO- ART

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.772
COMMAND TODAY PROPOSED. ELIGIBLE

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:19.174
PRODUCTS- AND PLANNING GRANTS OF

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:20.776
THE APPROACH THAT WAS TAKEN BY

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.511
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH

INCOME STUDENTS AT THE CAMPUS

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.709
THE BED CAPACITY THE CAMPUS AS

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:10.712
FAR AS FACTORS THAT DROVE THOSE

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.347
PROJECTS TO BE A HIGHER PRIORITY

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:14.583
. THE INTERSEC METAL PROJECT AT

01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:17.052
IBC IS ARE THE TOP PRIORITY

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:18.286
CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERSEGMENT

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:20.455
APPROACH TAKEN BY DEPARTMENT OF

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:23.692
FINANCE. THE SPREADSHEET SHOWS

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:25.160
THAT THE CSU WAS PROPOSING CO

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:27.129
FUNDING SO THE STATE GRANT FUNDS

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:29.698
WOULD LEVERAGE CSU FUNDS AND IT

01:19:29.764 --> 01:19:31.933
WOULD ENABLE THE COST PER BED TO

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.468
BE REDUCED BY FIFTY SEVEN

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:35.070
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR BED. SO

01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:36.238
WITH THE AFFORDABLE STUDENT

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:38.707
GRANT FUNDING THE COST PER BED

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:40.642
REDUCES TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:42.244
SEVENTY THOUSAND PER BED. IN THE

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.379
SPLIT BETWEEN THE GRANT FUNDS

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.248
AND CSU FUNDING WOULD BE 65%

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:49.951
GRANT FUNDING 35% C. S. USE OF

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:52.354
BOND FINANCING. THE SECOND THE

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.955
CSU PROPOSES THE STATUE BE

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:54.923
BROADENED TO ALLOW FOR

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.558
RENOVATIONS TO INCREASE OCCUPANT

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.693
DENSITY IN EXISTING FACILITIES.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.295
AND THE IDEA THAT WE TARGET AN

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:02.230
AMOUNT OF THE FUNDS TO PROVIDE

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:02.797
HOUSING GRANTS DIRECTLY TO

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:05.267
STUDENTS. SO IF ALLOWED

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.468
RENOVATION PROJECTS COULD BE

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:09.771
SUBMITTED FOR TWO THOUSAND

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:11.173
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THE

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:13.308
THIRD YEAR OF THE PROGRAM. END

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:13.942
OF WE'VE PROVIDED TO COMMITTEE

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.510
STAFF A STRIKE THROUGH ON

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:17.879
PROPOSED DETAILS ON STATUTE

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:19.881
CHANGES FOR THE USE. THE

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:21.516
RENOVATIONS WE WOULD PROMOTE OR

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.084
THOSE PROJECTS WHICH ALLOW US TO

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:25.187
INCREASE DENSITY TO GO FROM TWO

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:27.189
BEDS TO THREE. AND PRIMARILY

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:29.324
ADDRESS FIRE SPRINKLERS FIRE

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:31.526
SAFETY NEEDS IN THE PROJECT

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:34.663
EGRESS- AND ALARM SYSTEMS. BUT

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:36.097
WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS CODE

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:38.200
UPGRADES THAT ARE REQUIRED SO

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:41.636
ENERGY EFFICIENCY. ADA BUT IN BY

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:43.071
ALLOWING RENOVATION PROJECTS TO

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.173
BE. ELIGIBLE IT WOULD REDUCE THE

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.309
COST FOR BED. THE SECOND CHANGE

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.677
IN STATUTE WOULD ALLOW THIS

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.111
PORTION OF GRANT FUNDS TO BE

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:52.847
USED FOR DIRECT GRANTS. FIFTY

01:20:52.914 --> 01:20:53.515
MILLION IS THE NUMBER WE'RE

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:55.550
LOOKING AT IN WEEK WOULD RUN

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:57.385
ADDITIONAL NUMBERS LOOKING AT-

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:59.387
HOW WE WOULD SET UP AN ENDOWMENT

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:00.922
FUND. THAT THE THOUGHT IS TO

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:02.457
REDUCE THE COST. TO MEET THE

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.559
STATUTE REQUIREMENT THE 30% TO

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:07.762
FIFTY PERCENT. AND OF AN NFL

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:09.331
ENABLE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:12.434
VACANCY. TWO IT OFFER THOSE

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.469
STUDENTS BEDS NOW SO THEY COULD

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:17.572
BE OFFERED AS SOON AS FALL

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:18.173
VERSUS HAVING TO WAIT FOR THE

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.441
CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION.

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:21.576
WHICH WOULD GO OUT POLICE MAYBE

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:23.111
FALL OF TWENTY FIVE SO THERE'D

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:26.381
BE IMMEDIATE BENEFIT TO STUDENTS

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:27.382
IF. HE WERE TO AGREE. IT ALSO

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:28.984
ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CERTAINTY

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.485
ISSUES RAISED BY THE LA- WITH

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:32.420
THE RISK OF CONSTRUCTION AND THE

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:34.256
COST ESCALATION THAT IS A

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:35.657
SIGNIFICANT FACTOR TO WEST 8%

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:37.559
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.461
THEY WERE GOING TO FIGURE OUT

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:40.729
HOW TO MANAGE THAT FOR THE

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:41.863
PROJECTS WITHIN THE GRANT

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:42.831
FUNDING. THE PLAN WOULD BE FOR

01:21:42.897 --> 01:21:45.066
ALL STUDENTS ALL STUDENTS TO USE

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.701
THEIR FEDERAL AND STATE.

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:49.037
FINANCIAL AID FIRST. AND LOOK AT

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.338
THOSE STUDENTS WITH STILL

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.607
REMAINING UNMET NEEDS BEFORE

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:54.576
THEY'D HAVE TO TAKE OUT A LOAN.

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:55.710
SO THIS APPROACH WOULD BE

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.579
POTENTIAL YEAH NOT ONLY THE

01:21:57.646 --> 01:22:00.081
FASTER BENEFIT BUT IT INCREASES

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:01.283
THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.351
HOUSING. IT SUPPORTS OUR GRAD IT

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:05.120
SHOULD HAVE BEEN BALANCES OUT

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:06.388
AVAILABILITY SO WE'RE WE HAVE

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:09.291
BEDS AGAINST. AFFORDABILITY AND

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:11.159
SOME BEDS ARE ARE OPEN NOW OWNER

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.761
OCCUPANCY RATES ARE LOW BECAUSE

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:15.297
OF CODED SO WE HAVE SOME FALSELY

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:18.133
LOW. VACANCY RATES BUT WE HAVE

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:20.201
CAMPS THE DO HAVE VACANCIES THAT

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:22.170
WE COULD OFFER VERY QUICKLY. SO

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:23.872
IN SUMMARY THE CSU REQUEST IS

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:25.974

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:23.631
WANT TO START BY ASKING EACH-

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:25.533
FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A BIG ISSUE

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.669
THAT WE'RE KNOWLEDGE IN FOR THE

01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:29.570
FIRST TIME IN HISTORY

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:30.138
CALIFORNIA. MAYBE THE STATE

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:32.240

HOUSING WE JUST LET IT HAPPEN ON

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:37.512
ITS OWN. AND OBVIOUSLY THE UC

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:39.480
AND CSU HAVE A MAJOR PRIORITY

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:41.482
BECAUSE YOUR- UNDERGRADUATES

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:43.317
LIVE ON CAMPUS COMMUNITY

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:44.786
COLLEGES NOT SO MUCH. AS

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:46.754

SOME CAMPUSES HAVE STUDENT

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:51.259
HOUSING. BUT I THINK THE

01:28:51.325 --> 01:28:52.093
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BECAUSE OF THE-

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.696
HOUSING CRISIS OVERALL AND JUST

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:56.397
THE FACT THAT HOUSING COSTS SO

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:59.901
MUCH OF THE STUDENTS- YOU KNOW

01:28:59.967 --> 01:29:02.503

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:03.304
LOAD OF STUDENTS AND JUST YOU

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:05.540
KNOW- DEMAND ON CAMPUSES THAT WE

01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:06.908
NEED TO STEP UP AND FOCUS ON

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:08.843
STUDENT HOUSING SO WE DECIDED TO

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:10.945
DO THAT THE QUESTION IS AS THE

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:13.047

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:23.758
HOUSING FOR A SECOND WE PUT. THE

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:25.827
MONEY LAST YEAR FOR A 100% OF

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:28.162
THE MONEY TO FUND THE FUND FOR

01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:30.565

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:11.966
MILLION AND IF WE COULD HAVE SIX

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:13.534

WHERE TO CAMPUS IS LOCATED AND

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:13.881
THAT MEANS THAT THE RENTAL RATES

FOR THOSE ROOMS ARE FORCED TO BE

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:18.119

JUST TO SHARPEN THAT POINT ON

01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:43.077
THAT YOU MADE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:46.213
MCCARTY- THE STATUE DID NOT SET

FORTH SPECIFIC GUIDELINES ON

FUND MATCHING. AND SO ALL THE

01:34:50.684 --> 01:34:52.119
APPLICATIONS VERY QUITE A BIT IN

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:54.021
TERMS OF WHETHER WAS A 100%

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.756
STATE FUNDING OR A MIX OF STATE

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:57.558
FUNDING AND ON STATE FUNDING CSU

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:58.926
TOOK A PRETTY BLANKET APPROACH

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:02.396
OF DOING 65% STATE 35% NONSTATE.

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:05.433
BROTHER SEGMENTS THE CAMPUS IS

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:07.168
VERY QUITE A BIT- IF THAT IS OF

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:09.670
INTEREST TO YOU IF YOU WOULD

01:35:09.737 --> 01:35:10.337
LIKE TO SPREAD FUNDING OVER MORE

01:35:10.404 --> 01:35:12.506
PROJECTS TO PROTECT. POTENTIALLY

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:13.040
COVER MORE PROJECTS MORE

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:15.176
CAMPUSES. A ONE STATUTORY CHANGE

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:16.844
YOU COULD CONSIDER IS- SETTING

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:18.212
FORTH SPECIFIC FUND MATCHING

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:21.215
GUIDELINES LIKE. 20% OR 30% OF

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:22.750
THE COST WOULD BE. COVERED

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:24.418
THROUGH NON STATE FUNDS SO THAT

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:26.053
THAT IS AN OPTION TO THE

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.188
LEGISLATURE IF IT IF IT DID WANT

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:30.024
TO SPREAD. SPREAD MORE FUNDS

01:35:30.091 --> 01:35:34.228
OVER MORE PROJECTS. FOR OKAY.

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:37.231
QUESTIONS MISTREATING. SO JUST

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:39.433
JUST A SECOND A POINT FOR ONE

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.436
SECOND I THINK- IT SEEMS THAT

01:35:42.503 --> 01:35:46.040
THE SEGMENTS WOULD LIKE TO. HAVE

01:35:46.107 --> 01:35:47.508
THE GREATER SUBSIDY OR THE TWO

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:48.976
SEGMENTS LIKE THAT THE GREATER

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:50.611
SUBSEA JUST BECAUSE THEN HAS

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:52.279
GREATER CERTAINTY OF THE PROJECT

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:54.682
BEING COMPLETED VERSES- IF YOU

01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:58.085
DON'T HAVE A POT OF MONEY TO ADD

01:35:58.152 --> 01:36:01.522
TO THAT PROJECT THEN YOU HAVE TO

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:03.591
GO OUT AND SEARCH FOR THAT MONEY

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:04.792
RIGHT SO I THINK- ONE ME WHAT WE

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.560
COULD DO IS. THAT THE SEGMENTS

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:08.629
DECIDE SAY CSU'S DECIDED HEY

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:10.197
THEY HAD THEY WERE ABLE TO.

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:12.466
PROVIDE 35% THEY CAN LEVERAGE

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:14.201
THAT OTHER MONEY OTHERS TWO

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:18.072
SEGMENTS DECIDED NOT TO RESIGN.

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:20.474
FEREBEE COMFORT CHARACTERIZATION

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:26.247
OF WHAT THE WHAT WAS SAID. SINGH

01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:30.751
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOOD- SO-

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:32.887
REGARDING JUST SORT OF- GOOD

01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:34.755
JUST GOING TO YOU SEE FOR ONE

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:38.092
QUICK SECOND SO YOU UCLA- WAS

01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:39.593
ABLE TO ANNOUNCE THAT FOR THE

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:42.096
FIRST TIME IN THE SCHOOL'S

ENTERING FRESHMEN FOUR YEARS OF

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:48.802
HOUSING WHICH I THINK WAS A

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:51.138
FAIRLY FAIRLY HISTORIC- STEP IN

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:54.341
SO- COULD YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF

01:36:54.408 --> 01:36:55.976
HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:57.077
THAT ESPECIALLY IN AN AREA THAT

01:36:57.144 --> 01:36:59.680
IS VERY. URBAN VERY INFILL IS

01:36:59.747 --> 01:37:01.749
NOT MERCED IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:04.018
TO BUILD IN THE WESTERN PART OF

01:37:04.084 --> 01:37:05.653
LOS ANGELES COULD YOU BE TO WALK

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:07.388
US THROUGH HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:10.090
KIND OF ACHIEVE THAT GOAL MAYBE

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:11.358

01:38:45.152 --> 01:38:46.954
CAMPUSES WE STRIVE TO HAVE.

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:49.923
RENTS EITHER ACT MARKET OR BELOW

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.925
MARKET UP 220% BELOW MARKET.

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:53.460
GODDESS OF STUDENTS WERE

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:55.362
DIRECTED SAY TO THOSE P. THREE.

01:38:55.429 --> 01:38:56.630
PROPERTIES THEY WOULD

01:38:56.697 --> 01:38:58.499
NECESSARILY FEEL A DIFFERENCE

01:38:58.565 --> 01:39:01.802
THAN. THE OTHER UCLA HOUSING

01:39:01.869 --> 01:39:04.405
UNITS. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY- AND

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:06.040
YOU JUST GO INTO LA- REALLY

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:07.508
APPRECIATE ALL THE POINTS THAT

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:09.977
YOU RAISED ON I MEAN THERE'S A

01:39:10.044 --> 01:39:11.712
COUPLE. COUPLE ISSUES. PART PART

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:13.981
OF THIS HOUSING PART OF MONEY

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:16.917
THAT- THE ASSEMBLY ADVOCATED FOR

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:19.386
WHICH WE WERE NOT ABLE TO. GET

01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:20.821
INTO THE AGREEMENT WAS NOT ONLY

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:22.656
WITH HIS HOUSING MONEY. BUT THIS

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:24.892
COULD BE USED FOR CAMPUS

01:39:24.958 --> 01:39:27.928
EXPANSION- AS AS WE SAW FROM

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:30.164
THIS UC BERKELEY CASE- WE'VE

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:32.333
BEEN ASKING ALL THE SEGMENTS OFF

01:39:32.399 --> 01:39:33.701
ALL THREE SEGMENTS TO INCREASE

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:34.968
ENROLLMENT TO INCREASE CAPACITY

01:39:35.035 --> 01:39:37.037
WE HAVE A TWO MILLION. DEGREE

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:38.439
SHORTFALL IN IT'S IMPORTANT AT

01:39:38.505 --> 01:39:40.341
ALL THREE. SEGMENTS INCREASED

01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:42.376
CAPACITY WELL HOUSING IS A VERY

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:43.410
CRITICAL PIECE OF THAT

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:44.912
OBVIOUSLY. YOU CAN'T INCREASE

01:39:44.978 --> 01:39:45.913
CAPACITY IF YOU DON'T MORE

01:39:45.979 --> 01:39:49.083
CLASSROOMS MORE FACULTY MORE.

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:50.351
PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SO I

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:52.086
THINK. THAT'S THE PART THAT I

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:54.254
THINK IS ALSO. A POTENTIALLY

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:55.823
MISSING HERE SO I DON'T KNOW IF

01:39:55.889 --> 01:39:57.991
EL AL HAS. DONE ANY ANALYSIS OR

01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:04.264
THOUGHTS- I DO I DO- I DO FEEL

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:06.166
THE- ISSUES THAT L. A. REYES AS

01:40:06.233 --> 01:40:10.838
CRY TO. MORE YOU TO FULLY

01:40:10.904 --> 01:40:13.674
CONSIDER AROUND- THE ABILITY TO

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:16.276
INCREASE ENROLLMENT CAPACITY- IF

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:18.412
THE HOUSING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:20.781
IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY-

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.583
OBVIOUSLY IF HOUSING IS ALREADY

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:23.450
CHEAPER PLENTIFUL IN A

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.819
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY- I DON'T

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:27.554
KNOW IF THAT'S MAYBE THE BEST

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:30.124
PLACE TO BUILD MORE. MORE

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:33.127
HOUSING- ALTHOUGH- ALTHOUGH FOR

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:34.962
SOME YOU KNOW HARDER TO REACH

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:35.629
SPECIALLY FOR COMMUNICABLE JUST

01:40:35.696 --> 01:40:37.531
HARDER TO REACH REGIONS- WHERE

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:39.400
YOU KNOW A COMMUTE MAY BE A TWO

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:41.068
HOUR COMMUTE NOT A TWENTY MINUTE

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:43.103
COMMUTE. OBVIOUSLY WE DO HAVE TO

01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:44.738
FACTOR THAT IN SO THAT THAT

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:47.574
COULD BE ANOTHER FACTOR- I DON'T

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:50.010
BELIEVE SHOVEL READY WAS SORT OF

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:52.846
A FACTOR. IS THAT MY RIGHT EXACT

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:55.816
COUNT OKAY NOT NOT A THANK YOU.

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:57.551
AND THEN ALSO- HELPING ALONG

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:59.153
WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE ROMA

01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:00.053
CAPACITY INCREASES ALSO TO SORT

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.389
OF. ABILITY TO DO THE CAMPUS

01:41:02.456 --> 01:41:04.425
EXPANSION SO JUST GOING TO-

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:08.562
FINANCE- WERE. YOU KNOW IS

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:10.998
ESERVER HERE GOING INTO THIS

01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:13.267
SORT OF NEXT VERSION I THINK

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:15.402
WITH ANY WITH ANY FIRST YEAR WE

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:17.137
LEARNED A LOT WE SEE A LOT. YOU

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:19.640
KNOW AND I THINK IT'S GREAT I'M

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:21.108
I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT THIS GOT.

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:22.943
ALSO GOT OFF THE GROUND. WE'RE

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:24.144
SEEING THEIR PROJECTS WE'RE

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:25.312
SEEING A HUGE DEMAND FOR

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:26.947
PROJECTS BUT JUST GOING TO

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:28.248
FINANCE FOR SECOND. WHAT WHAT

01:41:28.315 --> 01:41:29.650
ABOUT YOU KNOW FURTHER

01:41:29.716 --> 01:41:31.652
CONSIDERING SOME OF THESE.

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:33.487
FACTORS AND ALSO AGAIN ONE OF

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:35.322
THE CRITIQUES OF LA- WAS THAT

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:37.291
THE FACTORS WEREN'T- SORT OF

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:39.593
WIDELY PUBLICIZED BEFORE THE-

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.928
APPLICATIONS WERE IN WHICH I

01:41:40.994 --> 01:41:43.030
UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S WE'RE TRYING

01:41:43.096 --> 01:41:44.465
TO BE FAST. SO I'M NOT THAT'S

01:41:44.531 --> 01:41:45.899
NOT A- CRITIQUE IS JUST A IT

01:41:45.966 --> 01:41:47.601
KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THAT WAS

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:49.403
SOMETHING THAT WE ALL PRIORITIZE

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:50.037
RE PRIORITIZE SPEED THIS YEAR

01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:51.572
WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT. I

01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:53.140
GIVE YOUR HOUSE A SHORT BUT WHAT

01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:55.042
WHAT ABOUT IRAN THE CAPACITY.

01:41:55.108 --> 01:41:56.009
HOUSING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS AS

01:41:56.076 --> 01:41:59.613
WELL AS YOU KNOW PRIORITIZING

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:00.781
PROJECTS THAT ARE READY READY TO

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:02.149
GO. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT-

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:05.285
QUESTION. I CHAIR TANG- SO WE'VE

01:42:05.352 --> 01:42:07.387
FIRST NOTE THAT- OUR REVIEW OF

01:42:07.454 --> 01:42:09.022
THESE APPLICATIONS WAS. REALLY

01:42:09.089 --> 01:42:11.492
BASED IN IN THE STATUTE- AND

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:13.927
NAMELY YOU KNOW ONE OF THAT. THE

01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:16.129
TO BEING- CONSTRUCTION COSTS PER

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:17.498
BED WHICH IS REALLY AN

01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:19.466
EFFICIENCY METRICS- AND THEN RAN

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:21.401
TO WHICH WAS. REALLY THE KEEP

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:22.669
COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM RIGHT

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:25.072
IS STUDENT AFFORDABILITY- AND IN

01:42:25.138 --> 01:42:26.640
TERMS OF THE OP OPTIONS THAT

01:42:26.707 --> 01:42:27.841
YOU'VE PLAYED. SOME OF THEM

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:30.344
BEING- YOU KNOW. THINGS NOTED IN

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:31.845
STATUTE YET YUP YEAH NOT

01:42:31.912 --> 01:42:34.581
REQUIRED IN TERMS OF OUR OUR

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:35.482
EVALUATION- IT'S DEFINITELY

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:38.285
SOMETHING- SO THE THINGS THAT WE

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:40.120
ARE ARE IN STATURE THAT WE COULD

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:45.726
HAVE CONSIDERED. ABOLITION

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:47.561
STATUTE WE DIDN'T TAKE INTO

01:42:47.628 --> 01:42:49.563
ACCOUNT AT THIS TIME- BUT WE'RE

01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:52.132
HAPPY TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS

01:42:52.199 --> 01:42:53.333
. I WOULD JUST CURIOUS WHAT L.

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.735
A- THOUGHT ABOUT- FURTHER

01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:56.436
EXPANDING THE CRITERION TO THOSE

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:58.472
AREAS AS WELL AS WITH THE

01:42:58.539 --> 01:43:00.340
SEGMENTS MIGHT. THINK ABOUT THAT

01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:02.876
- YES SO. A STATUTE AS AS A

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:05.112
FINANCE NOTED ACTUALLY HAD SEVEN

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:07.681
SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT COULD BE

01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:08.916
CONSIDERED. AND THEY LARGELY

01:43:08.982 --> 01:43:10.884
ALIGNED WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUES

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:12.853
THAT YOU RAISED AROUND IN AS A

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.521
SHOVEL READY. ENROLLMENT

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:17.758
CAPACITY- IT ALSO INCLUDES

01:43:17.824 --> 01:43:19.626
OPTIONS LIKE CONSIDERING THE

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:21.495
SHARE OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS

01:43:21.562 --> 01:43:22.496
THAT ARE IMPACTED AT A

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:22.963
PARTICULAR CAMPUS. THE

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.032
ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED JUST

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:26.833
ONE OF THESE FACTORS WHICH WAS

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.535
ON WHETHER OR NOT THE PROJECT

01:43:28.602 --> 01:43:29.303
WAS ANDERSON METAL AND GIVE.

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:30.837
HIGH PRIORITY TO THAT ANY

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:31.939
INTERSEGMENT A PROJECT THAT WAS

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.407
ELIGIBLE IMMEDIATELY GOT RANKS

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:35.275
NUMBER ONE. I DIDN'T EXPLICITLY

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:36.743
CONSIDER THESE OTHER FACTORS AND

01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:38.979
SO- YOU KNOW IF THESE ARE

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:40.480
FACTORS THAT ARE OF PRIORITY TO

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:43.116
LEGISLATURE IT COULD CONSIDER.

01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:43.784
INCORPORATING THEM INTO THE

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:45.018
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OR

01:43:45.085 --> 01:43:46.954
COULD IT COULD DO IT IN LIEU

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:49.623
ONCE SOME OF THE

01:43:49.690 --> 01:43:50.257
ADMINISTRATION'S METHODOLOGY. I

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:50.991
GET A TON OF DEPENDS ON- WHICH

01:43:51.058 --> 01:43:53.493
OF THESE SORT OF METRICS ARE OF

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.728
PARTY THE LEGISLATURE IN WHICH

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:56.263
SORT OF A LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS. I

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:56.964
WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:59.866
STAFF ON EXPORT OTHER OPTIONS IN

01:43:59.933 --> 01:44:00.500
THE IN THE COMING MONTHS- COULD

01:44:00.567 --> 01:44:02.536
NOT GO BACK TO FINANCE WITHIN

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:04.037
THE OTHER. THEIR OTHER FACTORS

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:07.541
IN. THE STATUE WAS A REASON THAT

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:09.610
THOSE WERE NOT PART OF THE-

01:44:09.676 --> 01:44:11.011
ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT. YEAH I

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.879
THINK FOR US IT WAS AGAIN LIKE

01:44:12.946 --> 01:44:14.781
GOING BACK TO THE STATUTE I

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.083
THINK THAT WAS THE MAIN CONCERN

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:17.484
AND THEN ADDITIONALLY WE WHAT WE

01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:18.986
NEEDED TO EVALUATE SOMETHING

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.053
THAT WAS CONSISTENT ACROSS. ALL

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.855
APPLICATIONS AND SO CONSTRUCTION

01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:24.758
COSTS PER BED WAS IN A- YOU KNOW

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:26.293
THE SAME METRIC RIGHT DOLLAR U.

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.828
S. DOLLAR TO BED. AND THEN

01:44:27.894 --> 01:44:29.596
ADDITIONALLY THE RENT WAS

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:30.731
SOMETHING THAT WE REQUIRED VERY

01:44:30.797 --> 01:44:32.799
SPECIFICALLY IN STATURE AND SO

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:34.868
WE WERE ABLE TO GAUGE WHAT THEY

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:36.303
ARE. THEIR MAXIMUM COST WAS ABLE

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:38.071
TO BE AND THEN WHAT PERCENTAGE

01:44:38.138 --> 01:44:40.273
OF THAT COST- THEY REACH TO THAT

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.876
WAS A CONSISTENT MEASURE ACROSS

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:43.443
ALL APPLICATIONS. REBECCA'S

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:45.312
CONSTRUCTION COSTS- IS GOING TO

01:44:45.379 --> 01:44:48.148
VARY. WIDELY ACROSS THE STATE I

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:48.949
MEAN CONSTRUCTION COSTA SAN

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:52.719
FRANCISCO VERSUS. CONSTRUCTION

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:54.287
COSTS IN CHESTER ARE. YOU KNOW

01:44:54.354 --> 01:44:56.723
THE MUCH WILL BE A TWO STATES

01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:57.824
SITES I THINK I THINK. WE WANT

01:44:57.891 --> 01:44:58.892
WE WANT TO USE THE MONEY

01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:01.528
EFFICIENTLY I TOLD WE CONTINUE

01:45:01.595 --> 01:45:02.229
TO SUPPORT. HAVING FINANCIAL

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:04.331
METRICS BUT I DO. BELIEVE THAT

01:45:04.398 --> 01:45:07.401
WE HAVE TO. LOOK AT SOME IS

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:08.702
OTHER FACTORS AS WELL- IN AND

01:45:08.769 --> 01:45:09.703
HAVING SAID THAT OBVIOUSLY WE

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:10.737
HAVE PLENTY OF GOOD PROJECTS I

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:13.640
DON'T THINK I WILL YOU KNOW AND

01:45:13.707 --> 01:45:14.775
JUST JUST TAKING A SCAN OF THESE

01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:16.009
PROJECTS THAT THE- U. S. LOOKS

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:18.211
LIKE MANY OF THESE MOST THESE

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:19.713
PROJECTS ARE VERY GOOD SO IT'S

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.281
NOT. IT'S NOT A REALLY MATTER IF

01:45:21.348 --> 01:45:22.883
IT'S MEAN TO ME IT'S REALLY

01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:24.484
MATTER FOUGHT WHEN AND HOW HOW

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:26.586
DO WE HOW DO WE HELP SUPPORT.

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:27.220
GETTING THESE PROGRAMS OFF THE

01:45:27.287 --> 01:45:28.121
GROUND. I DON'T KNOW IF THE

01:45:28.188 --> 01:45:30.557
SEGMENTS HAD ANY. ANY COMMENTS

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:36.029
ABOUT THE CRITERION. THANK YOU

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:37.898
ASSEMBLY. CHIANG I THINK CSU IF

01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:40.300
WE HAD KNOWN THAT. ONE OF THE

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:42.769
CRITERIA WOULD BE HOW FAR BELOW

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:44.438
THE 30% 250% WE COULD HAVE

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:48.075
FASHIONED. OUR USE OF THE 30%

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:50.110
DIFFERENTLY. AND SWUNG THAT

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:51.912
METRIC. YEAH I THOUGHT WE

01:45:51.978 --> 01:45:53.046
THOUGHT THE CONSTRUCTION START

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:54.915
DATE WAS ONE OF THE KEY DRIVERS

01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:56.149
BASED ON THE IMMEDIACY AND THE

01:45:56.216 --> 01:45:58.618
PRIORITY. SO THAT WAS ONE OF OUR

01:45:58.685 --> 01:46:00.554
FACTORS AND CUTTING UP WHICH

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.490
PROJECTS. THANK YOU. I'LL JUST

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.692
ADD A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS I

01:46:05.759 --> 01:46:07.027
THINK THERE ARE SOME DEFINITE

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:08.695
OPPORTUNITY COSTS THAT ARE.

01:46:08.762 --> 01:46:11.264
REALLY WORTH CONSIDERING SOME OF

01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:12.332
WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN INCLUDED

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:15.469
WHICH IS- IF THE CONCERN IS HOW

01:46:15.535 --> 01:46:17.904
QUICKLY THE STATE CAN DELIVER ON

01:46:17.971 --> 01:46:19.406
AFFORDABLE PROJECTS REALLY

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:21.541
LOOKING AT. THE ABILITY OF A OF

01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:24.711
A PROJECT TO DELIVER IS KEY-

01:46:24.778 --> 01:46:26.346
BOTH IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION

01:46:26.413 --> 01:46:29.950
TIMELINE- AND IN THE COMMITMENT-

01:46:30.016 --> 01:46:31.918
THE OTHER- CONSIDERATIONS

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:34.688
LOOKING DOWN THE LINE ARE- SOME

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:36.490
OF THE COMMUNITY FACTORS OF WHO

01:46:36.556 --> 01:46:39.993
IS SERVED. AND THEY COST OF

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.628
RENTS IN THAT REGION COMPARED

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:43.897
TO- THE RENT THAT IS PROPOSED IN

01:46:43.964 --> 01:46:46.233
THESE PROJECTS OF THOSE ARE SOME

01:46:46.299 --> 01:46:48.368
VIABLE ONES. THAT ALSO ARE. TO

01:46:48.435 --> 01:46:51.438
THE AFFORDABILITY VALUES OF THIS

01:46:51.505 --> 01:46:54.875
PROGRAM. AND THOSE WERE

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:56.877
EXCELLENT COMMENTS ALL JUST ADD

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:59.045

CALIFORNIA'S OVERSUBSCRIBED WITH

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:02.282
ALL THE PROJECTS WE ALREADY PUT

01:47:02.349 --> 01:47:03.950
FORWARD. I DO THINK THAT IT

01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:06.419
WOULD BE WORTHWHILE FOR THE

01:47:06.486 --> 01:47:06.953
LEGISLATURE TO COMPARE OF

01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:07.921
REGIONAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:09.990
RATHER THAN ALL THE CONSTRUCTION

01:47:10.056 --> 01:47:11.525
COST. OF ALL THE PROJECTS

01:47:11.591 --> 01:47:13.593
AGAINST EACH OTHER BECAUSE COSTS

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.929
CAN VARY SO GREATLY ACROSS THE

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:18.999
STATE AND ALSO GIVEN- DIRECTION

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:21.434
OF INFLATION RIGHT NOW LOOKING

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:23.837
AT THE ABILITY OF THE CAMPUS TO

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:25.839
PROVIDE. NON STATE FUNDING FOR

01:47:25.906 --> 01:47:28.275
CONTINGENCY COSTS AND ALSO

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:32.145

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:57.516
THAT STUDENT- SO THAT THAT'S HOW

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:59.852
WE ARE CURRENTLY PLANNING ON

02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:02.021
RUNNING THE PROGRAM DO YOU HAVE-

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:04.323
DEFINITION KNOW WHO ARE THE LOW

02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:10.096
INCOME STUDENTS- WE HAVE NOT.

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:12.064
DETERMINED ADAM. POLICY YET IN

02:01:12.131 --> 02:01:13.699
TERMS OF THE APPLICATION THAT

02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:15.267
THESE DORMITORIES BUT WE DO

02:01:15.334 --> 02:01:18.104
HAVE- MANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:20.806
STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES WHO-

02:01:20.873 --> 02:01:22.041
HAVE LOW INCOME TO THE POINT

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:24.276
WHERE THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A

02:01:24.343 --> 02:01:24.910
ZERO EXPECTED FAMILY

02:01:24.977 --> 02:01:26.412
CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THEIR

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:28.014
EDUCATION. MEANING THAT THEY

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:30.416
HAVE EXTREMELY LIMITED FUNDS SO

02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:33.486
WE WOULD LOOK TO TOP POOL OF

02:01:33.552 --> 02:01:35.321
STUDENTS FIRST. OKAY I AND THEN

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:38.391
THE QUESTION IS THAT THE- I DO

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:40.626
KNOW THAT THOSE INCOME

02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:42.862
CATEGORIES CHILDREN SO. TO MY

02:01:42.928 --> 02:01:44.897
IMPRESSION THEY HAVE A ABUNDANCE

02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:47.199
OF FINANCIAL AID TO PROGRAM

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:50.436
SELECT A CAL GRANT- AND UP POPS

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:52.972
OUT- GOVERNMENT THERE'S SOME

02:01:53.039 --> 02:01:56.509
STAR- AS A SUBSIDY AND THEN ALSO

02:01:56.575 --> 02:01:58.577
YOU HAVE OF. IS DIFFERENT KINDS-

02:01:58.644 --> 02:02:01.847
BOOK IN TONER UNIVERSITY-

02:02:01.914 --> 02:02:05.251
SCHOLARSHIP SO- I'M PLAY ENOUGH

02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:09.555
TO PAY THEIR REGULAR. IN OTHER

02:02:09.622 --> 02:02:14.060
CELL AFFORDING THEIR OWN HOUSING

02:02:14.126 --> 02:02:15.461
. YOU'RE CORRECT WE CURRENTLY

02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:18.130
OFFER SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AID

02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:19.532
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:02:19.598 --> 02:02:21.434
AND THE STUDENT THEN HAS WHAT'S

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.736
CALLED- THE SELF HELP LEVEL

02:02:23.803 --> 02:02:24.737
WHICH IS CURRENTLY SET IN

02:02:24.804 --> 02:02:27.940
STATUTE AT JUST UNDER EIGHT

02:02:28.007 --> 02:02:30.810
THOUSAND DOLLARS LIKE. SEVEN

02:02:30.876 --> 02:02:31.477
THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR

02:02:31.544 --> 02:02:33.446
SOMETHING- IT'S SET IN STATUTE

02:02:33.512 --> 02:02:35.581
AND THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:36.882
TO STUDENT HAS TO COME UP WITH I

02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:39.719
THROUGH THEIR OWN WORK OR LOANS-

02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:41.687
SO WHILE WE DO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL

02:02:41.754 --> 02:02:43.255
FINANCIAL AID FOR OUR LOWEST

02:02:43.322 --> 02:02:45.558
INCOME STUDENTS THEY STILL DO

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:48.527
HAVE NEED OF WE WOULD NOT EXCEED

02:02:48.594 --> 02:02:50.529
THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IN

02:02:50.596 --> 02:02:52.364
THE AID TWENTY STUDENT WE CAN'T

02:02:52.431 --> 02:02:54.967
WE CAN'T DO THAT BY FEDERAL LAW.

02:02:55.034 --> 02:02:56.502
SO IF THE STUDENT LOOKS LIKE

02:02:56.569 --> 02:02:57.903
THEY NO LONGER HAVE FINANCIAL

02:02:57.970 --> 02:02:59.538
NEED- AND THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:02:59.605 --> 02:03:00.806
GETTING TOO MUCH INSTITUTIONAL

02:03:00.873 --> 02:03:02.942
AID WE WOULD THEN TAKE SOME OF

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:04.710
THAT INSTITUTIONAL AID AND GIVE

02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:06.879
IT TO A LESS NEEDY STUDENT NOW

02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:09.615
WHO WHO DID NOT HAVE A ZERO

02:03:09.682 --> 02:03:10.983
EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION SO

02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:12.284
WE'LL USE OUR FINANCIAL AID

02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:14.286
PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHO ARE D.

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:18.390

TIME UC SYSTEM- HOW MANY ARE-

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:29.969

HUNDRED SOMETHING- SANDERS SAYS

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:48.521
SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE. ARE AT

HOUSING AND NOT WITHOUT. THE

02:03:59.799 --> 02:04:03.669
HELP OF THE- YOU SEE THIS IS.

02:04:03.736 --> 02:04:07.606
UNIVERSITY IS- HELPFUL AND- THEY

02:04:07.673 --> 02:04:12.444
ARE STRUGGLING. SO SYSTEM WIDE

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:14.814
WE KNOW THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.849
WHO ARE CONSIDERED LOW INCOME AT

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:19.752

RECEIVE PELL GRANTS WHICH IS

02:04:24.456 --> 02:04:25.758
USUALLY A METRIC USED FOR

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:28.027
SOMEONE WHO'S A VERY LOW INCOME

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:33.065
STATUS- ON OUR CAMPUSES-

ANYWHERE BETWEEN. A ONE THIRD TO

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:37.203
HALF OF STUDENTS WILL HAVE A

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:40.339
GREAT FINANCIAL NEED- THE TWO

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:42.074
PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:43.542
BEING PROPOSED TO RISK FUNDING

02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:47.646
WOULD PROVIDE A COMBINED- ABOUT

02:04:47.713 --> 02:04:48.647
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY

02:04:48.714 --> 02:04:49.982
BEDS SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MEET

02:04:50.049 --> 02:04:52.651

THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:11.303
IN THE RECOGNITION THAT THE

CONSTRUCTION GRANTS. AND THAT IS

02:05:16.475 --> 02:05:19.845
SOMETHING THAT I HOPE THAT- WILL

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:22.748
BE REVISITED AND WILL BE

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:23.949

GRANTS I THINK IS A GOOD THING

02:05:26.785 --> 02:05:27.353
BUT WE WANT TO GO BEYOND THE

02:05:27.419 --> 02:05:29.722
PLANNING AND WE WANT TO ACTUALLY

02:05:29.788 --> 02:05:30.823
GET THE CONSTRUCTION DONE. A

02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:32.458
SECOND THING IS THAT THE

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:33.359
CONVERSATION REGARDING THE P.

02:05:33.425 --> 02:05:37.663
THREE- AGREEMENTS AND CONTRACTS-

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:40.199
ARE USING THAT AS A TOOL I THINK

02:05:40.266 --> 02:05:44.136
ABSOLUTELY THE SAFEGUARDS- NEED

02:05:44.203 --> 02:05:47.606
TO BE THERE- FINALLY IF WE'RE

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:50.910
TALKING ABOUT. MONEY COMING IN

02:05:50.976 --> 02:05:53.078
FROM THE STATE. WE ABSOLUTELY

02:05:53.145 --> 02:05:54.847
NEED TO PERHAPS ITS POLICY

02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:56.515
PERHAPS REGULATIONS WHATEVER IT

02:05:56.582 --> 02:05:58.717
IS NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SAFEGUARD

02:05:58.784 --> 02:06:01.587
THE STATE'S INVESTMENT AND THAT

02:06:01.654 --> 02:06:03.022
HAS TO DO WITH THE OWNERSHIP.

02:06:03.088 --> 02:06:04.890
AND WITH THE OPERATION OF THE

02:06:04.957 --> 02:06:08.894
STUDENT HOUSING. THE WE RECKON

02:06:08.961 --> 02:06:10.896
THAT TO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:12.564
P. THREES WERE TALKING ABOUT

02:06:12.631 --> 02:06:13.499
SOMEBODY USINGTHEIR PERSONAL

02:06:13.565 --> 02:06:16.702
FUNDS OR THE CORPORATE FUNDS TO

02:06:16.769 --> 02:06:19.004
PARTNER WITH THE STATE WITH FOR

02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:21.674
THAT FOR THESE FOR THE HOUSING.

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:22.775
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY

02:06:22.841 --> 02:06:24.443
SHOULD HAVE THE OWNERSHIP THEY

02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:25.678
HAVE A RIGHT OF RETURN THEY

02:06:25.744 --> 02:06:27.780
DON'T HAVE THE OWNERSHIP AND I

02:06:27.846 --> 02:06:29.915
THINK THAT SOMETHING. SHOULD BE

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:32.217
DONE SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE

02:06:32.284 --> 02:06:34.853
THAT THAT THAT THAT THOSE WHO

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:36.689
ARE PRIVATE INDUSTRY WHO DO

02:06:36.755 --> 02:06:38.223
INVEST TO HELP IN THIS THAT IT'S

02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:39.892
CLEAR THAT IT IS AN INVESTMENT

02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:40.993
WITH THE RIGHT OF RETURN AS

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:43.762
OPPOSED TO AN INVESTMENT. WITH A

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:46.332
OF THE THOUGHT THAT OF OWNERSHIP

02:06:46.398 --> 02:06:48.734
OF THE PROPERTY. AT THE OTHER

02:06:48.801 --> 02:06:50.736
THING HAS TO DO SPECIFICALLY

02:06:50.803 --> 02:06:51.904
WITH THE RENT AFFORDABILITY THE

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:53.939
WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE STUDENT

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:56.809
HOUSING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

02:06:56.875 --> 02:06:58.911
STUDENTS HAVE HOUSING. AND IF WE

02:06:58.978 --> 02:07:01.013
BILL THE HOUSING BUT IN THE END

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.381
OUR STUDENTS CAN'T AFFORD IT IT

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:04.416
IS NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR

02:07:04.483 --> 02:07:06.552
STUDENTS AND THAT IS IN THE END

02:07:06.618 --> 02:07:08.787
THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS WE'VE

02:07:08.854 --> 02:07:09.989
TALKED ABOUT OUR STUDENTS WITH

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:13.025
THE GREATEST NEED- AND TO THOSE

02:07:13.092 --> 02:07:14.093
OF THE STUDENTS THAT WE WANT TO

02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:17.096
BE SURE THAT WE- PROVIDE HOUSING

02:07:17.162 --> 02:07:18.998
FOR- IT THE- EARLIER TESTIMONY

02:07:19.064 --> 02:07:21.266
BEFORE I STEPPED OUT. WE HEARD

DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THIS

02:07:24.036 --> 02:07:25.204
STUDENTS WHO APPEARED TO BE

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:26.939
HOMELESS FOR PERIODS OF TIME

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:28.907
LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND- HAVING

02:07:28.974 --> 02:07:31.543
TO SHARE. HOUSING WITH FIFTEEN

02:07:31.610 --> 02:07:33.579
OTHER STUDENTS IN A HOUSE THAT'S

02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:35.014
SUPPOSED TO BE FOR SIX STUDENTS.

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:37.082
THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS

02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:38.283
THAT THIS THREE BILLION DOLLARS

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:42.788
WAS. OUR CHAIR WORKED VERY HARD-

02:07:42.855 --> 02:07:45.057

INDUSTRY TO MAKE. WE WANT THEM

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:06.145
TO MAKE A GOOD RATE OF RETURN

02:08:06.211 --> 02:08:08.814
BUT WE DON'T WANT ANY OWNERSHIP

02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:10.082
GOING OUTSIDE OF THE STATE IF IT

02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:12.818
IS THE STATE'S INVESTMENT FOR

02:08:12.885 --> 02:08:14.686

BUT AS WE LOOK TO. DRUM EXPAND

02:09:06.038 --> 02:09:07.372
COLLEGE ENROLLMENTS WE NEED TO

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:08.841
BUILD MORE HOUSING LOOKAS

02:09:08.907 --> 02:09:12.144
HAPPENING AT UC BERKELEY SO WE

02:09:12.211 --> 02:09:13.579
NEED THIS CRYSTAL CLEAR. BUT SO

02:09:13.645 --> 02:09:16.448
THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE OF YOU SEE

02:09:16.515 --> 02:09:17.382
RIVERSIDE APPARENTLY THEY HAD A

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:19.918
REQUEST FOR FIFTY MILLION. AND

02:09:19.985 --> 02:09:23.355
THEY- DIDN'T MEET THE- RENT.

02:09:23.422 --> 02:09:25.924
COMPUTATION RELATED TO THEIR

02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:27.526
STATUTORY REQUIREMENT WHAT IS

02:09:27.593 --> 02:09:29.194
THE NAME AND ALL THAT MEANS YEAH

02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:32.531
SO- IN STATURE. THE RENT TO BE

02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:34.800
30% 250% OF THE AREA MEDIAN

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:36.635
INCOME AND THEY PROPOSED A RENT

02:09:36.702 --> 02:09:39.538
THAT WAS ABOVE THAT REQUIREMENT

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:40.839
. THAT WAS THAT STATUTES THE

02:09:40.906 --> 02:09:43.942
BOSTON. YEAH SO THAT WAS THE

02:09:44.009 --> 02:09:45.310
POLICY THAT WE SET FORTH IN THE

02:09:45.377 --> 02:09:47.045
RULES FOR THE TWO BILLION FROM

02:09:47.112 --> 02:09:50.349
LAST YEAR YES OKAY SO I GUESS A

02:09:50.415 --> 02:09:52.684
FEW THINGS ONE. THEY CAN GO BACK

02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:53.952
AND LOOK AT THAT PROJECT WE

02:09:54.019 --> 02:09:55.687
COULD POTENTIALLY REEVALUATE

02:09:55.754 --> 02:09:59.057
THAT THIRTY PERCENT- AND THEN

02:09:59.124 --> 02:10:01.026
ALSO THE SECOND POT OF MONEY MAY

02:10:01.093 --> 02:10:04.029
NOT HAVE THOSE EXACT. STRINGS IN

02:10:04.096 --> 02:10:05.764
AND RESTRICTIONS ON THERE YEAH

02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:07.599
AND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE

02:10:07.666 --> 02:10:09.101
WOULD HOPE THAT THE RENT WOULD

02:10:09.168 --> 02:10:10.302
MEET THEIR NEED FOR- TO MAINTAIN

02:10:10.369 --> 02:10:11.937
THE FACILITY BECAUSE THAT WAS

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:13.138
ALSO A METRICS WE WOULD THAT WE

02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:16.308
EVALUATED AS WELL. YEAH BUT ALSO

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:19.144
IT'S PROBABLY APPLES TO ORANGES

02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:22.915
BECAUSE 30% OF WHAT IT IS AND

02:10:22.981 --> 02:10:25.017
UCLA AND BERKELEY IS VERY

02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:27.419
DIFFERENT THAN 30% IN ALREADY

02:10:27.486 --> 02:10:31.523
RIVERSIDE CELL. RIGHT I WOULD

02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:33.358
NOTE FOR THAT FOR THE RENT

02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:35.761
COMPETITION IN PARTICULAR IT'S

02:10:35.827 --> 02:10:38.797
BASED BY COUNTY YES- YOU KNOW

02:10:38.864 --> 02:10:41.033
THAT'S ONE WAY IN WHICH THE-

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:42.568
RENTAL RATES WERE REGIONALLY

02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:44.570
ADJUSTED SO THE RENTAL RATE

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:46.939
RENTAL COMPUTATION FOR. UC

02:10:47.005 --> 02:10:48.340
RIVERSIDE WAS BASED ON THE

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:50.909
RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND MY VERSES

02:10:50.976 --> 02:10:53.378
UCLA USING THE LOS ANGELES-

02:10:53.445 --> 02:10:58.150
COUNTY. MI OKAY. THANK YOU

02:10:58.217 --> 02:10:59.551
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE. YES SIR I

02:10:59.618 --> 02:11:02.087
COULD QUITE HEAR FROM THE SIDE

02:11:02.154 --> 02:11:03.655
OF THE ROOM BUT USE SO OF COURSE

02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:05.324
I AGREE ABOUT THE 30% OF HALF OF

02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:06.959
AMI'S SO THEY CAN BE AFFORDABLE

02:11:07.025 --> 02:11:07.960
BASED ON THE REGION BECAUSE

02:11:08.026 --> 02:11:09.127
SOMETHING ABOUT. FACTORING IN

02:11:09.194 --> 02:11:10.229
THE PRICE OF THE COST OF

02:11:10.295 --> 02:11:11.897
MAINTENANCE OR SOMETHING THAT

02:11:11.964 --> 02:11:14.499
WILL WHAT DID YOU SAY THAT. SO I

02:11:14.566 --> 02:11:17.202
JUST SAID THAT- A PART OF THE

02:11:17.269 --> 02:11:18.103
EVALUATION AS WELL WAS JUST TO

02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:20.038
ENSURE THAT THE RAIN COULD. MEET

02:11:20.105 --> 02:11:21.240
THEIR THEIR NEED TO MAINTAIN THE

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:23.909
FACILITY- BECAUSE IF THE RENT IS

02:11:23.976 --> 02:11:26.278
BELOW THAT THAT NEED- YOU KNOW

02:11:26.345 --> 02:11:28.080
WE WOULD JUST. HOPE THAT THEY

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:29.147
WOULD EXPLAIN HOW THEY WOULD

02:11:29.214 --> 02:11:31.650
MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. AND TO

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:32.251
AND THE CASE FOR UC RIVERSIDE

02:11:32.317 --> 02:11:34.319
THEY WERE NOT UNABLE TO DO THAT-

02:11:34.386 --> 02:11:35.887
NOW FOR THE CASE OF ROUTE UC

02:11:35.954 --> 02:11:36.955
RIVERSIDE THEY JUST- THEIR

02:11:37.022 --> 02:11:38.624
PROPOSED RENT THAT THEY PROVIDED

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:39.858
IN THEIR APPLICATION WAS ABOVE

02:11:39.925 --> 02:11:41.526
THE REQUIRED AMOUNT. WITHIN

02:11:41.593 --> 02:11:43.562
STATUTE. RIGHT SO I MEAN THAT'S

02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:44.896
SOMETHING THAT AND I A LIME A

02:11:44.963 --> 02:11:46.999
COMP EVERYONE ELSE SAID EVERY

02:11:47.065 --> 02:11:47.933
GREAT POINT THAT I COULD'VE MADE

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:48.967
ALREADY BUT IT IS IMPORTANT

02:11:49.034 --> 02:11:50.035
OBVIOUSLY FOR THIS POPULATION OF

02:11:50.102 --> 02:11:51.436
SPECIAL STUDENTS SPECIAL

02:11:51.503 --> 02:11:53.872
CONCERNS. ALSO AS SOON IS PAYING

02:11:53.939 --> 02:11:55.073
TO WORK RIGHT BEING A STUDENT

02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:57.209
FULL TIME IS A JOB IN AND OF

02:11:57.276 --> 02:11:59.511
ITSELF AND MAYBE THEY HAVE PART

02:11:59.578 --> 02:12:00.112
TIME WORK TO SUPPLEMENT THAT.

02:12:00.178 --> 02:12:01.713
BUT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.482
AFFORDABILITY AND- A HIGHER

02:12:03.548 --> 02:12:04.449
SOME. IS BETTER- THERE IS OF

02:12:04.516 --> 02:12:05.784
COURSE THIS POINT YOU RUN INTO

02:12:05.851 --> 02:12:07.686
OF COURSE IF WE'RE BUILDING. AS

02:12:07.753 --> 02:12:09.655
SUBSIDIZES POSSIBLE CAN THE

02:12:09.721 --> 02:12:11.023
PROJECT CAN THE DEVELOPMENT

02:12:11.089 --> 02:12:12.324
ITSELF BE SUSTAINED RIGHT AND

02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:13.859
THAT'S A PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THE

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:16.862
LARGER CONTEXT. OF GOVERNMENT.

02:12:16.928 --> 02:12:17.996
SPONSORED HOUSING THAT'S THE

02:12:18.063 --> 02:12:19.164
LARGER PROBLEM WE HAVE IS LIKE

02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:21.133
CAN IT BE SELF SUSTAINING. AND

02:12:21.199 --> 02:12:22.000
THAT'S SOMETHING I HOPE THERE'S

02:12:22.067 --> 02:12:23.869
SOME FACTOR NEW ONCE BECAUSE- OF

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:25.837
WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR THE P.

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:28.507
RIGHT FOR IT YOU KNOW WHAT

02:12:28.573 --> 02:12:30.075
FIFTY. HALF OF START 30% OF HALF

02:12:30.142 --> 02:12:31.777
OF AM I. IN RIVERS I COUNTY. IS

02:12:31.843 --> 02:12:33.078
GREAT FOR THE FOR THE PERSON

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:35.280
BUT- THE FIXED COSTS OF

02:12:35.347 --> 02:12:36.682
MAINTAINING A PLACE MAY NOT BE

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.083
QUITE. THE ROUNDED UP THAT WAY.

02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:40.419
BECAUSE WITH THAT HAVE. 30% OF

02:12:40.485 --> 02:12:42.888
HALF A MIND TO BE AREA WHERE I

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:43.488
REPRESENT OBVIOUSLY IS MUCH

02:12:43.555 --> 02:12:46.091
GREATER AMOUNT AND CANS

02:12:46.158 --> 02:12:47.959
SOMETIMES SUPPLEMENT THE CALL-

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:50.095
HIGH FIXED COSTS NOT ALWAYS.

02:12:50.162 --> 02:12:51.697
THIS CAN DEPENDING ON THE

02:12:51.763 --> 02:12:52.831
SITUATION- SO I THINK IT'S

02:12:52.898 --> 02:12:54.833
ABOARD THE FACT. THINGS AND- YOU

02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:56.168
KNOW I THINK I KNOW THAT SHARE

02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:57.235
KIND OF BROUGHT UP SOME POINT

02:12:57.302 --> 02:12:59.538
ABOUT. HOW YOU SPREAD THE WEALTH

02:12:59.604 --> 02:13:01.039
AMONG THE CHILDREN. AND I HOPE

02:13:01.106 --> 02:13:02.474
THAT WITH OUR ADDITIONAL ROUNDS

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:03.241
OF MONEY IN THE FIVE BILLION

02:13:03.308 --> 02:13:04.076
DOLLARS IN. INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY

02:13:04.142 --> 02:13:09.681
THAT WE CAN GET. TO- AS COMPLETE

02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:10.882
SPEND FOR YOU ALL SPOTS BECAUSE

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:13.085
I KNOW WITH YOU THIS IS A J.

02:13:13.151 --> 02:13:14.586
HOUSING. RIGHT IF THERE'S SO

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:15.821
MUCH AND TRYING TO BUY. MONEY

02:13:15.887 --> 02:13:17.856
FOR PROJECTS IT BAKES THEM LESS.

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:18.824
CERTAIN TO BE BUILT THAT LOTS OF

02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:21.159
THE RESULTS IN DELAYS RIGHTS

02:13:21.226 --> 02:13:21.727
PROJECT UP. MIGHT NOT EVEN

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:22.894
PENCILING OUT OR WHATEVER IT

02:13:22.961 --> 02:13:24.029
MIGHT HAPPEN SO I. AM MUCH ON

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:25.864
THAT SIDE OF DELIVERING THAT

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:27.232
SENSE AND I IT RECOGNIZE ALSO

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:28.367
COMMENTS ABOUT NEEDING AN

02:13:28.433 --> 02:13:28.967
EXTERNAL PARTNER. AND THAT'S

02:13:29.034 --> 02:13:30.902
ALSO PARTLY WHY YOU KNOW IN IN

02:13:30.969 --> 02:13:33.205
MY HOUSE ARE PROPOSING A BILL

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:34.106
ABOUT HAVING A STATE SPONSORED

02:13:34.172 --> 02:13:35.474
ENTERPRISE TO BUILD MORE

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:36.108
HOUSING. AND FRANKLY IT'S ALSO

02:13:36.174 --> 02:13:37.275
INFORMED BY THE- MODEL THAT YOU

02:13:37.342 --> 02:13:38.977
ARE PAYING HEARING YOU KNOW

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:39.878
FIRST OF FOREMOST YOU'RE ALL

OF RECALL STATE. WHICH IS. VERY

02:13:45.016 --> 02:13:46.118
INTERESTING BUT IT IS KIND OF A

02:13:46.184 --> 02:13:48.153
LEARNING LESSON FOR US IN THE

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:49.087
STATE THAT. PERHAPS THERE IS A

02:13:49.154 --> 02:13:50.756
STRONGER C. INTERVENTION IN THIS

02:13:50.822 --> 02:13:52.057
AND IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE

02:13:52.124 --> 02:13:53.759
LEVERAGE RESOURCES DO SO. SO I

02:13:53.825 --> 02:13:55.293

OUTSIDE THE ROOM. BUT SIDE I

02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:00.899
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:14:00.966 --> 02:14:01.967
SHOULD MAINTAIN AFFORDABILITY AS

02:14:02.033 --> 02:14:03.168
MUCH AS POSSIBLE- AND ALSO

02:14:03.235 --> 02:14:04.736
HOPEFULLY WE CONTINUE TO INVEST

02:14:04.803 --> 02:14:06.371
IN IN OUR BUDGET SO HOPEFULLY A

02:14:06.438 --> 02:14:07.272
LOT MORE MONEY WILL COME AND

NOW- EVEN THOUGH THERE'S ONE

02:14:11.143 --> 02:14:13.345
VERY PROJECT ON THE LIST RIGHT

02:14:13.412 --> 02:14:14.513
NOW. I REPRESENTS THE OTHER BAY

02:14:14.579 --> 02:14:15.747
AREA. SECTION THAT IS ONE OF THE

02:14:15.814 --> 02:14:16.882
FIVE MOST EXPENSIVE METROPOLIS

02:14:16.948 --> 02:14:18.150
AIRS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY SO

02:14:18.216 --> 02:14:19.785

02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:21.319
BAY AREA- BUT THAT I JUST WANNA

THANK- DOCTOR CHOI. FINAL

02:14:27.893 --> 02:14:30.462
QUESTION IF. WE MOVE ON. YEAH

02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:33.331
LET ME- JUST A RAY HAS- COMES TO

02:14:33.398 --> 02:14:38.236
MY MIND- THIS PANDEMIC THAT THAT

02:14:38.303 --> 02:14:40.705
THE WE ARE EXPERIENCING HAS A

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:46.645
CERTAIN NEEDS CHANGE- THE WORKER

02:14:46.711 --> 02:14:50.449
FOR ILLNESS BY PRIVATE COMPANY

02:14:50.515 --> 02:14:54.820
EMPLOYEES I NOTICED THAT- MANY

02:14:54.886 --> 02:14:57.756
EMPLOYEES- NOW PICK AND CHOOSE-

02:14:57.823 --> 02:15:01.293
THE EMPLOYMENT. BASED UPON THE

02:15:01.359 --> 02:15:04.029
EMPLOYER SO REQUIREMENTS HOW

02:15:04.095 --> 02:15:07.065
MANY TIMES SHOULD. A PEER TO THE

02:15:07.132 --> 02:15:10.001
OFFICE TO WORK AND THE THEIR

02:15:10.068 --> 02:15:13.572
PREFERENCE IS SET TO WORK LAST

02:15:13.638 --> 02:15:16.775
SELLECCA ONCE A WEEK- AT THE-

02:15:16.842 --> 02:15:21.646
WORKPLACE- AND OF USING THAT-

02:15:21.713 --> 02:15:24.082
NEW TREND I THINK THAT'S

02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:26.818
CERTAINLY OUR PARADIGM IF YOU

02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:29.654
WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE IS A

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:31.857
SHIFTING AND THEN ALSO DOING

02:15:31.923 --> 02:15:33.825
DEPEND THAT MAKE UP WE HAVE

02:15:33.892 --> 02:15:36.528
EXPERIENCED. CAMPUS WAS SHUT

02:15:36.595 --> 02:15:39.731
DOWN BUT THE LEARNING CONTINUED.

02:15:39.798 --> 02:15:42.267
THROUGH TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS

02:15:42.334 --> 02:15:43.702
ASSUME I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES

02:15:43.768 --> 02:15:45.136
THE MATH THOSE SO YOU HAVE

02:15:45.203 --> 02:15:50.175
DEVELOPED TO TEACH A- AND SEVEN.

02:15:50.242 --> 02:15:53.512
WITH HIS EXPERIENCE- I WONDER IF

02:15:53.578 --> 02:15:56.081
WE CAN EXPLORE IT EXPLORE

02:15:56.147 --> 02:16:00.619
FURTHER- AND IMPROVE FOR

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:03.221
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN-

CONCERN IS THAT- THE ACTIVITIES

02:26:57.475 --> 02:26:59.277
THAT SO UNDERTAKES SUPPORTING.

02:26:59.343 --> 02:27:01.846
EDUCATIONAL INNOVATIONS A NEW

02:27:01.913 --> 02:27:04.015
ONLINE TOOLS AND CONTENT OF

02:27:04.081 --> 02:27:05.283
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:07.251
INTERVIEWS ARE ACTIVITIES THAT.

02:27:07.318 --> 02:27:08.619
A CAMPUS IS ALREADY RECEIVE

02:27:08.686 --> 02:27:11.255
BASED ON GOING SUPPORT TO

02:27:11.322 --> 02:27:13.424
UNDERTAKE. IN ADDITION SINCE THE

02:27:13.491 --> 02:27:16.093
PANDEMIC CAMPUSES HAVE- NOTABLY

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:17.795
INCREASED OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT

02:27:17.862 --> 02:27:19.363
WITH THESE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE

02:27:19.430 --> 02:27:21.165
SPENDING A PORTION OF THEIR A

02:27:21.232 --> 02:27:22.733
FEDERALLY FUNDING ON

OUR STORE SELL TO THAT'S PREPAID

02:27:28.673 --> 02:27:31.842
DEBIT LEVEL. IS UNCLEAR TO US.

02:27:31.909 --> 02:27:34.412
FOR THAT REASON WE RECOMMEND

02:27:34.478 --> 02:27:35.680

02:27:40.952 --> 02:27:42.820
THIS IS EFFECTIVELY ANOTHER

02:27:42.887 --> 02:27:45.856
ROUND OF INNOVATION AWARDS OF

02:27:45.923 --> 02:27:47.191
GOVERNORS AND PASTORS HAVE

02:27:47.258 --> 02:27:48.960
PROPOSED HIGHER EDUCATION

02:27:49.026 --> 02:27:50.795
INNOVATION AWARDS THEY-

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:52.997
TYPICALLY SUPPORT. CAMPUSES ARE

02:27:53.064 --> 02:27:54.999
FACULTY IN UNDERTAKING WATER

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:58.035
CONSIDERED INNOVATIVE PRACTICES

02:27:58.102 --> 02:27:59.403
. HELLO IN PAST YEARS HAS BEEN

02:27:59.470 --> 02:28:00.805
SKEPTICAL THESE INNOVATION

02:28:00.871 --> 02:28:02.106
AWARDS FOR NUMBER OF REASONS ONE

02:28:02.173 --> 02:28:04.008
BEING THAT- THESE ARE AGAIN THE

02:28:04.075 --> 02:28:05.076
SORTS OF ACTIVITIES THAT

02:28:05.142 --> 02:28:07.011
CAMPUSES ARE EXPECTED TO

02:28:07.078 --> 02:28:08.312
UNDERTAKE AS PART OF THEIR

02:28:08.379 --> 02:28:10.047
ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT.

02:28:10.114 --> 02:28:11.849
AND ALSO BECAUSE IN PAST YEARS

02:28:11.916 --> 02:28:14.719
THERE'S BEEN SORT OF A SMALL

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:15.353
NUMBER OF AWARD RECIPIENTS. AND

02:28:15.419 --> 02:28:16.621
THEN VERY LITTLE CLEAR PATHWAY

02:28:16.687 --> 02:28:17.955
IN TERMS OF HOW TO SCALE

02:28:18.022 --> 02:28:20.358
INSEMINATE OTHERS BEST PRACTICES

02:28:20.424 --> 02:28:22.827
MOVING FORWARD. IN ADDITION TO

02:28:22.893 --> 02:28:25.663
THOSE ARE. ONGOING CONCERNS WE

02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:27.398
HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS SPECIFIC

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:28.766
PROPOSAL IN THAT IT HAS A MUCH

02:28:28.833 --> 02:28:30.001
BROADER SCOPE THAN PREVIOUS

02:28:30.067 --> 02:28:31.636
INNOVATION AWARDS- WORSE

02:28:31.702 --> 02:28:33.371
PREVIOUS INNOVATION WHERE TO

02:28:33.437 --> 02:28:34.572
FOCUS PRIMARILY ON STUDENT

02:28:34.639 --> 02:28:35.439
OUTCOMES. THIS WOULD ALSO FOCUS

02:28:35.506 --> 02:28:37.908
ON CLIMATE ISSUES AND- ANY OTHER

02:28:37.975 --> 02:28:39.877
ISSUE THAT IS THAT COULD BE

02:28:39.944 --> 02:28:41.712
CONSIDERED SORT OF INNOVATIVE

02:28:41.779 --> 02:28:43.714
AND IMPACTFUL. GIVEN ITS BROAD

02:28:43.781 --> 02:28:45.383
SCOPE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE

02:28:45.449 --> 02:28:46.851
INITIATIVE WOULD FULLY ADDRESS

02:28:46.917 --> 02:28:48.252
ALL THE ISSUES THAT AIMS TO

02:28:48.319 --> 02:28:49.854
ADDRESS AND FOR THAT REASON- WE

02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:51.289
RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS

02:28:51.355 --> 02:28:54.191
PROPOSAL. I'M MOVING ON TO THE

02:28:54.258 --> 02:28:55.526
THIRD PROPOSAL THE TWENTY

02:28:55.593 --> 02:28:57.428

ON. CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF

02:29:01.265 --> 02:29:04.302
SCIENCE. OTHERS WOULD SUPPORT OF

02:29:04.368 --> 02:29:05.903
PART OF THE COST TO CONSTRUCT A

02:29:05.970 --> 02:29:07.438
NEW FACILITY FOR THE INSTITUTE

02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:09.473
WHICH IS A- PRIVATE NONPROFIT

02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:13.277
ENTITY. BECAUSE OF THE PRIVATE

02:29:13.344 --> 02:29:14.345
NONPROFIT ENTITY THE LEGISLATURE

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:16.180
WILL HAVE LITTLE GUARANTEE THAT

02:29:16.247 --> 02:29:18.783
THE- OUR ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN

02:29:18.849 --> 02:29:21.218
BY THE INSTITUTE WILL ALIGN WITH

02:29:21.285 --> 02:29:24.755
STATE OBJECTIVES. AND THEN MORE

02:29:24.822 --> 02:29:26.090

MENTIONED IN ISSUE ONE. FOR

02:29:35.132 --> 02:29:36.133
THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE

PROPOSED APPROACH AND I'LL

02:54:57.687 --> 02:54:59.622
HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THEM. THE

02:54:59.689 --> 02:55:00.990
FIRST CONCERN IS THAT THERE ARE

02:55:01.057 --> 02:55:01.958
MANY EXISTING SOURCES OF

02:55:02.024 --> 02:55:04.760

FROM COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

02:55:09.031 --> 02:55:09.932
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT

YOU'RE A DUPLICATE THESE

02:55:19.809 --> 02:55:22.178
EXISTING RESOURCES. FOR EXAMPLE

02:55:22.245 --> 02:55:23.279
SOME OF THE PROPOSED FUNDS WOULD

02:55:23.346 --> 02:55:24.947
BE USED TO CREATE A BORROWER

02:55:25.014 --> 02:55:26.215
FACING WEBSITE TO PROVIDE

02:55:26.282 --> 02:55:27.884
INFORMATION ON STUDENT LOANS.

02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:30.086
ALTHOUGH THE US DEPARTMENT OF

02:55:30.152 --> 02:55:31.220

02:55:31.287 --> 02:55:33.623
WEBSITE. CONCERN WE HAVE RELATES

02:55:33.689 --> 02:55:36.025

CURRENT BARS IN THE NEAR TERM

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:52.375
THERE ISN'T A CLEAR PROVISION TO

02:55:56.779 --> 02:55:57.780
ABOUT USING ONE TIME FUNDS IN

02:55:57.847 --> 02:55:59.548
THIS WAY IS THAT IT COULD LEAD

02:55:59.615 --> 02:56:00.816
TOA SHORT LIVED IMPACT WHILE

02:56:00.883 --> 02:56:02.118
