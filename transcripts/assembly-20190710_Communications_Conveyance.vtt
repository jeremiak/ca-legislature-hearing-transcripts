LOOK AT AT AT WHAT THIS MIGHT

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:24.168
MEAN HOW WE KNOW THAT THERE

00:43:24.234 --> 00:43:25.202
ARE SOME POTENTIAL INCREDIBLE

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:26.637
BENEFITS IN TERMS OF CONGESTION

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:29.039
REDUCTION IN EFFICIENCIES BUT

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:30.774
ALSO SOME STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:33.010
IF NOT DONE RIGHT AUTONOMOUS

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:33.777

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:38.048
STUDY DONE WITH SEVERAL ARE

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:39.216
UNIVERSITIES WHERE THEY GAVE

VEHICLES ACTUALLY TURNED OUT

00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:48.592
THAT FAMILIES ENDED UP BEING A

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:50.761
LOT MORE TIME DRIVING AROUND AND

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:51.795
THEY WOULD OFTENTIMES HAVE THE
