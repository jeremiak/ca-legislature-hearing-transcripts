IN THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT.

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.563
THE LINKAGE TO THE VOLUNTARY

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.198
AGREEMENT TO THIS BILL IS TO THE

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:23.800
EXTENT THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:25.468
ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY AND SAYS

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:29.005
WHAT WAS GOING ON ON JANUARY IN

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:29.772
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILL STAY IN

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.341
PLACE ON THE STATE SIDE.

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:32.208
MEANS THAT THERE'S NO

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:33.610
FLEXIBILITY OFFERED TO THE STATE

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:34.844
WATER PROJECT WITHIN THE

00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:36.212
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT.

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:36.946
THE STATE WATER PROJECT

00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:38.281
CONTRIBUTES TO THE VOLUNTARY

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.016
AGREEMENT IN THREE WAYS WE PLACE

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:42.318
A SURCHARGE ON OURDIVERSIONS

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:43.453
FOR SCIENCE AND HABITAT.

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.455
WE PLACE A SURCHARGE ON OUR

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:46.823
DIVERSIONS TO PURCHASE WATER.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.157
FROM A WILLING FOLLOWING

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:50.627
LANDOWNERS AND WE PROVIDE -- FOR

00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:52.095
WATER IS PART OF A PART OF THE

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:54.364
PACKAGE IF WE DO NOT HAVE THE

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:55.865
FLEXIBILITY TO EITHER.

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:57.000
IMPLEMENT A SCIENCE BASED

00:58:57.066 --> 00:59:00.403
DECISION PROCESS OR OUR OUR

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.204
OPERATIONAL CRITERIA SO

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:02.605
CONSTRAIN THAT WE CAN'T OFFER

00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:04.574
THAT VOLUNTARY WATER THE STATE

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:05.975
WATER PROJECT CANNOT PARTICIPATE

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.343
IN A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT.

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:08.378
I'M NOT SURE THE VOLUNTARY

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:09.412
AGREEMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:11.047
SUSTAINED WITHOUT STATE WATER

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:12.415
PROJECT PARTICIPATION.

00:59:12.482 --> 00:59:15.551
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

00:59:15.618 --> 00:59:17.453
AUTHORS -- STAFF AND PROPONENTS

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.488
WE THINK THERE ARE SOME

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:20.957
AMENDMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE WE

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:22.492
THE REST OF THE BILL IS REALLY

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.394
FOCUSED ON THE REGULATION AND

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.729
STATUTES SECTION WHERE THIS ONE

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:28.064
PORTION OF THE BILL FOCUSES ON

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:29.899
THE PERMIT LEVEL THE ACTUAL

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.367
CRITERIA AND AN EXISTING PERMIT.

00:59:31.434 --> 00:59:33.102
THAT IS REALLY THE PRIMARY BASIS

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.671
OF THE CONCERN WE HAVE AS IT

00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:35.471
RELATES TO BOTH.

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:36.773
ONGOING STATE WATER PROJECT

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:38.174
OPERATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:39.509
PARTICIPATE IN THE VOLUNTARY

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:40.476
AGREEMENT.

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:41.577
IF WE WERE ABLE TO AMEND THAT

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:45.548
PORTION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:53.523
REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION.

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:54.590
IT SEEMS SO NOW I WANT TO HEAR

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:55.091
ON THAT TOPIC FROM THE

00:59:55.158 --> 00:59:55.792
PROPONENTS AND THEN HAVE

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:57.260
QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:59.829
TOPIC SO THIS IS I WON UP.

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:00.496
ALL YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING ON

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:02.799
THIS TOPIC OKAY JUST TRIED TO

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:04.934
MAKE IT SHORT SO ALSO INCLUDED

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.269
IN THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:11.407
SECTION IS SUBSECTION G. WHICH

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:12.575
IS AN ATTEMPT.

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:13.476
TO APPLY CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:16.846
SPECIES ACT RULES TO THE

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:18.114
OPERATION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:20.350
PROJECT A FEDERAL PROJECT.

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:21.884
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.920
HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS OF

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:25.822
THE MOVEMENT OF WATER FOR THOSE

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:26.789
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:28.124
WHICH IS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.226
CALIFORNIANS AND THOUSANDS OF

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:30.660
FARMS.

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:33.663
ANDSO THAT SUBSECTION IS ALSO

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:34.664
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THE THE

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.132
CALIPERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.767
DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.702
APPLY ITS RULES TO THE FEDERAL

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:40.803
GOVERNMENT SO THAT'S AN

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.505
ADDITIONAL CONCERN TO THE

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.841
ENDANGERED SPECIES SECTION.

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:47.210
EXCELLENT THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK.

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:49.412
I HAVE ADDITIONAL BY ON THE SAME

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.246
ALL RIGHT AND I HAD.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:51.247
WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:53.583
THAT ADD LANGUAGE ABOUT

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:54.584
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS BUT IT

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:56.152
TALKS ABOUT THE PROCESS OF

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.553
VOLUNTEER AGREEMENTS WITH WHICH

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.055
MISS UNDERSTANDS OUR OPPOSITION

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.156
WE'VE NEVER.

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.591
ARGUE THAT SB ONE AFFECTS THE

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:02.792
PROCESS TO ENTER INTO A

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:04.627
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WE'VE TALKED

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.863
ABOUT ESSENTIALLY FREEZING THE

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.398
INDIVIDUAL PERMITS ON AN

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:09.399
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACTS SUCH

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:09.832
THAT.

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:11.934
YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:12.869
YOUR VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WILL

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:14.203
INFORM THE STATE WATER PROJECT

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.371
SO WE JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:16.406
THAT THE LANGUAGE WHICH WE

01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:18.007
APPRECIATE DOES NOT ADDRESS OUR

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:19.709
CONCERNS AT ALL.

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.277
AND JUST WHEN THE FLAG THAT

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.279
BEFORE WE ENTER INTO THE OKAY

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:28.051
THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.719
EXPERTS HAVE ANY INTRODUCE

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:32.522
YOURSELF IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE.

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:36.059
SO OUR MINUTES YEAH OKAY I'LL

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:36.993
TRY TO DO THIS AND FOUR MINUTES

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:37.960
NUTS SO MY NAME IS THAT CAN

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:39.095
DELFINO AND I'M WITH DEFENDERS

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.830
OF WILDLIFE AND JUST AS A LITTLE

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:41.731
OF BACKGROUND.

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:43.266
MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:44.167
INVOLVED IN THE VOLUNTARY

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.568
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROCESS

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.336
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:49.338
IN FACT WE WERE JUST IN A NICE

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:49.872
LONG MEETING WITH THE TWO

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:52.241
SECRETARIES -- DISCUSSING POLICY

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:53.576
ISSUES A AS A PERTAINS THE

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:56.079
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT SO AS A AS A

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:57.847
JUST A THRESHOLD MATTER -- IT

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.315
WAS NOT OUR INTENT TO WRITE A

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:00.516
BILL IN A WAY THAT WOULD

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:01.951
UNDERMINE A SUCCESSFUL

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:03.519
COMPLETION OF A VOLUNTARY

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.254
AGREEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE WE

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:06.189
BELIEVE STRONGLY.

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:08.157
THAT A COLLABORATIVE CONSENSUS

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.226
BASED OUTCOME AS A PERTAINS TO

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.828
THE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS FOR

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.863
THE BAY DELTA WOULD BE THE IDEAL

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:15.731
SOLUTION RATHER THAN JUST GOING

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:16.799
BACK INTO OUR OLD KANSEN

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:18.401
LITIGATING WHICH FRANKLY DOES

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:19.869
NOT GET US ANYWHERE.

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:21.104
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I JUST

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.505
WANT TO TAKE ONE MINUTE TO

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.373
EXPLAIN GENERALLY SPEAKING WHAT

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.409
THE ES A SECTION OF THIS BILL

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:31.447
DOES -- YES SAY ENDANGERED

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:32.081
SPECIES ARI.

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:32.548
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT

01:02:32.615 --> 01:02:35.318
PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL DOES --

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:38.154
SO WHEN THIS BILL WAS WRITTEN.

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:39.622
I ACTUALLY WAS THE PRECURSOR WAS

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:41.824
SB FORTY NINE AND NOW IT'S SB

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.292
ONE WE WERE FACING A NEW FEDERAL

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.495
ADMINISTRATION WHO HAD RETTY

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:47.730
MUCH DECLARED THAT THEY DID NOT

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:49.332
BELIEVE IN THE ENDANGERED

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.200
SPECIES ACT THEY WERE STARTING.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.236
LISTING DE DE LISTINGS ARE

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:54.403
REMOVALS OF SPECIES FROM

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.872
PROTECTIONS OF THE ENDANGERED

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:56.572
SPECIES.

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:58.741
LIST AND WE WERE WORRIED THAT WE

01:02:58.808 --> 01:02:59.942
WERE GOING TO BE FACING AN

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:02.211
ONSLAUGHT SO THE PROVISION WAS

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:04.680
WRITTEN SO THAT IF IN THE EVENT

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.015
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES A

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.451
RULE OR REGULATION.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.386
UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.722
IT WOULD TRIGGER REVIEW BY THE

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:13.956
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:15.725
IN THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.426
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THAT

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:18.361
WOULD THEN.

01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:20.496
WARRANT THEM PLACING THE ENDING

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.798
OF THAT SPECIES THAT QUESTION ON

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:24.333
THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY STATE

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.202
LISTED ON THE STATE ENDANGERED

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:27.236
SPECIES LIST.

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:30.273
IT ALSO ENCOMPASS BIOLOGICAL

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.341
OPINIONS AND INCIDENTAL STATE

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:33.376
BEEN CELL TAKE STATEMENTS ARE

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:35.144
PERMITS WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:36.812
THE OTHER TWO PROVISIONS

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:37.947
REGARDING AIR AND WATER.

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:39.815
BECAUSE UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.684
PROVISIONS REGARDING PORTER

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.219
COLOGNE AND THE CLEAN AIR ACT

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:44.854
WHEN CLEAN WATER ACT IS THERE'S

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.489
FEDERAL DELEGATION TO THE STATE

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.858
ON IMPLEMENTING THOSE PARTICULAR.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.593
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS BUT WE OF

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.595
PARALLEL PROGRAMS UNDER THE

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.030
ENDANGERED SPECIES WORLD.

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:56.432
SO IN ORDER TO ENCOMPASS ALL OF

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.367
THE PROTECTIONS ACCORDED TO SEE

01:03:58.434 --> 01:03:58.534
IT.

01:03:58.601 --> 01:04:00.770
LISTED FEDERALLY LISTED SPECIES

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:02.205
WE BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:03.773
INCORPORATE CHANGES TO

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:08.744
UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:10.346
AND INTERNAL TAKE STATEMENTS.

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:11.847
AND AND IF THERE'S A CHANGE TO

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:12.415
AN A BIOLOGICAL OPINION OR

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.150
INCIDENTAL TAKE STATEMENT THAT

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:14.684
THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.718
WILDLIFE.

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:17.720
I HAS DECIDED IS SUBSTANTIAL

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:20.223
ENOUGH THAT IT IS A WEAKENING OF

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:22.191
THE UNDERLYING FEDERAL STANDARD

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:24.227
THEY THEN WOULD TAKE ACTION TO

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.828
OTHER HAVE THE COMMISSION EITHER

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:26.963
MAKE THAT SPECIES.

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.731
Là THAT'S LISTED UNDER THE

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:30.967
FEDERAL ACT BUT NOT THE STATE

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.368
ACT PLACED UNDER STATE.

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:35.137
PROTECTION OR PUT IN PLACE IN A

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:37.907
IN A PERMIT THAT WOULD PROVIDE

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.842
ADDITION THAT THAT BACKSTOP THAT

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.277
INCREMENTAL BACKSTOP THAT WAS

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:44.313
FORMALLY LOST WITH THE CHANGE IN

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.414
THE BIOLOGICAL OPINION.

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:47.416
SO WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTIONS

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:48.818
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED WITH

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:50.753
RESPECT TO WATER -- AND THE

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.154
CHANGES THAT ARE HAVE BEEN

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.122
PROPOSED BY THE TRUMP

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.857
ADMINISTRATION TO THE BIOLOGICAL

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:57.860
OPINIONS THAT GOVERN THE RULES --

01:04:57.927 --> 01:04:59.929
THAT'S THE WAY THE FEDERAL WATER

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:03.332
PROJECT IS -- OF RUN.

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.268
IS A IT THE THE WHAT THE

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:06.769
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT ARE

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.070
GOING TO BE ISSUED.

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:10.039
OF ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.741
THAN THE PREVIOUS BIOLOGICAL

01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:14.777
OPINIONS AND IT WILL BE UP AND

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:16.245
IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW.

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:17.913
IT WOULD BE UP TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.082
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO DECIDE

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:23.486
WHETHER OR NOT -- THOSE OPINIONS

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:27.456
ARE LESS PROTECTIVE THEN THE PRE

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:29.892
EXIST THE PREVIOUS TWENTY EIGHT

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:30.493
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:31.227
OPINIONS.

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.296
I WILL SAY IT WAS NEVER OUR

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:35.398
INTENT IN WRITING THIS BILL TO

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:37.333
FREEZE IN TIME SCIENTIFIC

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.901
STANDARDS.

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:42.004
OR REQUIREMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:43.572
SEVENTEEN AND IGNORE ANY KIND OF

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:46.709
NEW AND UPDATED SCIENCE -- THAT

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.344
WAS NEVER OUR INTENTION IN FACT

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:49.812
WE AMENDED THE BILL BASED ON

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:51.013
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.149
OPPOSITION TO INCLUDE A

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:54.317
REQUIREMENT THAT THE THAT THE

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:57.453
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WHILE I HAVE

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:57.987
TO LOOK AT BEST AVAILABLE

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:58.487
SCIENCE.

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.056
NOW I THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:01.891
THAT WE COULD PROBABLY CONTINUE

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:02.858
TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON AND IN

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:05.394
FACT WE WILL HAVE A CONTINUED IF

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:06.429
IF THE BILL COMES OUT OF

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:07.229
COMMITTEE.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:08.097
WE WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:09.565
DISCUSSIONS TO CLARIFY THAT

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:11.801
FURTHER -- AND IN FACT I WOULD

01:06:11.867 --> 01:06:15.037
ALSO NOTE THAT -- UNDER THE TWO

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:15.871
THOUSAND AND EIGHT BIOLOGICAL

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:16.772
OPINION THERE HAVE BEEN

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:19.175
SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN HOW THEY

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:21.143
CALCULATE TAKE FOR SAY DELTA

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.878
SMELT SO EVEN THOSE OPINIONS

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:25.681
HAVEN'T BEEN FROZEN IN TIME --

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:28.851
HAD HAVE CHANGED -- AM UP SINCE

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:29.485
TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND PRIOR

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:30.853
TO THE RENEGOTIATION OF

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.188
CONSULTATION IN THESE NEW

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:33.522
BIOLOGICAL OPINION SO.

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:34.890
AGAIN IT WAS NEVER OUR INTENT TO

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:36.826
FREEZE SCIENCE IN TIME THAT

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.728
WOULD BE FRANKLY ANTITHETICAL TO

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:39.195
WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:41.364
COMMUNITIES BEEN SAYING ABOUT

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.964
THIS BILL.

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:43.499
WITH RESPECT TO THE VOLUNTARY

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:44.967
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS I WOULD

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:46.736
JUST SIMPLY STATE THAT AGAIN IT

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.537
WAS NOT OUR INTENT TO AFFECT THE

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:49.972
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS.

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:52.341
AND TO BE CEAR RIGHT NOW WE ARE

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.610
ONLY IN A PROCESS WITH RESPECT

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:56.812
TO THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS --

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:59.415
WE ARE -- IN THE INVOLVED IN

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:00.850
NEGOTIATIONS OVER A SET OF

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:02.251
PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:03.652
FORWARD BY THE TRIP BY SOME OF

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:04.687
THE TRIBUTARIES.

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.123
ON THIS IS NOT A PROCESS THOUGH

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.691
THAT IS PROCEEDING UNDER THE

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.192
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT.

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:11.694
SO WHEN WE WROTE OUR LANGUAGE

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.195
REGARDING NOT INTERFERING WITH

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:13.896
THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.131
AGREEMENTS WE PUT IT INTO THE

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:16.365
CLEAN WATER PROVISION.

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:18.033
BECAUSE THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.035
AGREEMENTS ARE ABOUT HOW WE

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:21.437
IMPLEMENT THE PORTER COLOGNE ACT

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.038
AND ACHIEVE WATER QUALITY

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:25.174
OBJECTIVES RELATIVE TO SALMON

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:26.142
DOUBLING.

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:27.810
AND THE VIABILITY OF NATIVE FISH

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.311
AND IT'S A MUCH BROADER SET OF

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:31.013
SPECIES AND IT'S A MUCH BROADER

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.650
SET OF OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:35.985
THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:36.585
THROUGH THOSE UP THROUGH THAT

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:37.286
PROCESS.

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:39.455
AGAIN WITH THAT BEING SAID WE

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:41.056
WOULD VERY MUCH WANT TO CONTINUE

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:43.592
TO DISCUSS WITH THE OPPOSITION --

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:45.628
WAYS OF CLARIFYING HOW YOU ARE

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:48.397
NOT TRYING TO FREEZE IN TIME

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:50.966
STANDARDS AND ALSO THE WHAT I

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:51.700
HAD.

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.402
THOUGHT WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.271
DISCRETION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:56.272
FISH AND WILDLIFE.

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:58.207
ABOUT HOW THEY INTERPRET WHAT

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.409
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:00.609
OKAY.

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.478
SO REALLY QUICKLY BECAUSE I IT

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.013
DIDN'T GET TAKEN NO WELLS POINT

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.548
I'M VERY ALL RIGHT BUT THEY DID

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:07.750
ASK A LOT -- SO WITH RESPECT TO

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:10.586
KNOW WELLS POINT ON THE

01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:15.157
APPLICATION OF SEIZE THE TO THE

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:16.725
TO THE USER I'M SORRY THIS

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.060
CALIFORNIAN INTERNET SPECIES ACT

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.995
I APOLOGIZE -- THE CALIFORNIA

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:20.729
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT TO THE

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:27.136
STEP TO THE FEDERAL PROJECT I

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:27.436
WOULD NOTE.

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:28.404
THAT.

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:29.405
ALREADY WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:30.005
CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:30.673
ACT APPLIES TO THE FEDERAL WATER

01:08:30.739 --> 01:08:31.807
PROJECT AND IN FACT THERE IS

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:32.842
LONG STANDING LAW.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:35.444
UNDER CALIFORNIA V. US IN WHICH

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.513
IT INTERPRETED -- SECTION EIGHT

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.081
OF THE RECLAMATION ACT WHICH

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.483
TALKS ABOUT HOW THE STATE MAY

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:41.951
IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON THE CONTROL

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:43.285
APPROPRIATION USE AND

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:45.054
DISTRIBUTION OF WATER THROUGH

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.388
RECLAMATION PROJECTS.

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:47.890
AND SO WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.826
IT IS -- CLARIFYING ED THAT C.

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:52.361
SO PLY I'M SORRY CALIFORNIA

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:53.896
DANGER SPECIES ACT APPLY BUT

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:55.397
WOULD ALSO POINT TO THE FACT

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:58.267
THAT THERE IS -- CORRESPONDENCE --

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.269
FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT FROM

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:01.937
THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION TO THE

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:02.771
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.607
WILDLIFE'S STATING THAT WHILE

01:09:04.673 --> 01:09:06.308
LONG FIN SMELLED ARE NOT A

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.776
FEDERALLY LISTED SPECIES.

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.578
THAT THEY WOULD ABIDE BY THE

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.547
STATE RULES UNDER THE

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:12.815
CALIFORNIAN ARE ENDANGERED

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.884
SPECIES ACT WITH RESPECT TO HOW

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.519
THEY OPERATE THE FEDERAL PROJECT.

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:20.523
SO IT IS I THINK -- MAYBE THE

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:23.125
OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE IT -- IF

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:26.061
THE UNIQUE IT WAS LESS CLEAR

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:28.731
ABOUT THE LETS ME THANK ABOUT

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:29.365
BUT THEY RIGHT ALL RIGHT BUT I'M

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:30.866
JUST SIMPLY POINTING OUT THAT --

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:33.502
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT -- AT THAT

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.471
THE FEDERAL PROJECT CURRENTLY

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:38.073
AND HAS UNDER A SORT OF A LONG

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.309
STANDING PRACTICE OF DIFFERENCE

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:41.310
TO STATE LAW.

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.913
HAS HAS ABIDED BY STATE RULES

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.214
WITH RESPECT TO THE OPERATION OF

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:46.916
THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT SO

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:48.217
WHAT IS PUT INTO THIS BILL IS

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:49.118
NOT.

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:52.922
SOME GROUND BREAKING PROPOSITION

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:59.261
SO I JUST ONE POINT THAT OUT

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:02.464
OKAY THANK YOU -- WELL.

THE SCOPE BUT YEAH I FRANKLY

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:10.406
EVERY MINUTE WAS NEEDED FOR WHAT

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:07.096
IMPORTANCE OF THE CONVERSATIONS

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:09.765
BECAUSE AS YOU'VE HEARD WALL

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.734
MANY OF YOU MAY NOT BE IS IT

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.135
ENGROSSED WITH SOME OF THE

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.336
DETAILS.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:16.639
IT'S IMPORTANT I AND WE HAVE

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.507
TRIED VERY HARD NOT TO MISS SOME

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:19.942
OF THE IMPORTANT PIECES.

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:23.012
OF WHAT THEY ARE DISCUSSING HERE --

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:25.280
BUT I HOPE IT UNDERSCORES THE

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:26.548
FACT THAT WE ARE TAKING THESE

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.550
ISSUES VERY SERIOUSLY WE ARE

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:29.652
INCLUDING THINGS IN THE

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:32.488
LEGISLATION. TO GET TO A NUMBER

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:33.822
OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:35.591
RAISED AS QUESTIONS AND WE'RE

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:36.725
GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.527
BUT OUT WE WANT THE ABILITY TO

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:40.362
CONTINUE TO WORK ON ALL OF THESE

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:41.764
ISSUES WHETHER WE'RE TALKING THE

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.565
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT -- THE

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.768
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WE HAVE NOW

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.302
ENGAGE THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:49.872
ARE BECAUSE THIS IS FAR REACHING

01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:50.773
BEYOND JUST A PIECE OF

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.608
LEGISLATION THAT WE CAN BANTER

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:58.947
BACK AND FORTH WITH ATTORNEYS I

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:04.119
MIGHT ADD -- YOU CITY.

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.121
I GIVE YOU A LOT OF CREDIT.

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:06.755
I'VE LEARNED A LOT THROUGH THIS

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:07.389
PROCESS BUT I DO THINK WHAT'S

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:07.990
VERY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE ARE

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.725
ENGAGING ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:11.493
THE IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.728
ENGAGED SO THAT WE'RE NOT

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:14.329
MISSING ANYTHING.

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:16.231
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:19.168
WORK IN THIS IN THIS WAY AS YOU

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:20.869
CAN SEE WHAT IT'S IT'S BEEN LIKE

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.438
IN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ON EVERY

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.305
ISSUE.

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:24.840
THERE ARE MORE THAN JUST THESE

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:26.175
TWO ISSUES THAT WE'VE TAKEN

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:27.443
AMENDMENTS ON AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.811
CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.746
CONVERSATIONS RIGHT AND AND I'LL

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:33.282
ADD THAT -- THE INTENT HERE IS

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:35.217
THAT ANY ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.186
BE TAKEN IN THE THIRD COMMITTEE

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:40.889
WHICH WILL BE A JUDICIARY -- AND

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:43.592
WE'RE NOT ASKING WE AS E. S. T.

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:44.927
M. ARE NOT ASKING FOR ANY

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:48.030
AMENDMENTS.

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.765
AT THIS TIME.

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:50.699
WE THINK THE BILL'S FINE.

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.067
BUT WE ALSO REALIZE THERE'S

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.602
CONCERN HERE AND WE WANT TO GET

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:56.972

I THINK IT.

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:14.189
THIS.

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:16.992
IS IT A MISTER HOLDEN.

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.227
MY MIND WAS MORE OF A COMMENT I

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.328
THINK THAT -- AND I DO

01:13:19.394 --> 01:13:19.962
APPRECIATE -- SORT OF

01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:21.196

THERE WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL.

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:50.425
WAS NOT DESIGNED -- TO PRECLUDE

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:51.693
FROM THERE BEING SOME

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.296
FLEXIBILITY -- TO BE ADDRESSED

A CONSENSUS THAT MAKES FAIR AND

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:17.746
IS MOVING.

OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE I

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.083

WILL CONTINUE.

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:36.765
THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN HAS BEEN

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:38.400
AS WE WERE LOOKING AT THESE

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:39.668
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AS WE'RE

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.136
LOOKING AT THE ENDANGERED

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:45.440
SPECIES ACT -- THAT WE WE

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.376

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:49.544
BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND

01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:50.112
SEVENTEEN THAT THAT WE ALLOW

01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:50.812
THAT FLEXIBILITY.

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:53.448
MOVING FORWARD I IN THERE AND SO

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:54.950
I JUST WANT TO ECHO THAT -- IT

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.318
SOUNDS LIKE THE PROPONENTS ARE

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:57.686
OPEN TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS TO

01:15:57.753 --> 01:16:00.022
CONTINUE THERE ARE OTHER

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:00.622
SECTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:02.457
DISCUSSED -- AND PROBLEMS IN

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:03.558
THIS BILL BUT I'VE SEEN THIS

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:04.526
ENOUGH THAT THAT'S MY ONLY

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:06.228
CONCERN ALSO I ALSO WANT TO BE

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:07.829
CLEAR THAT -- WHILE YOU'RE

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:10.365
NEGOTIATING ON OTHER STUFF A LOT

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:11.533
OF WHAT YOU'RE NEGOTIATIONS THAT

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.268
THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED NOW.

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:14.870
FOR OVER A YEAR THAT IS NOT THE

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:16.405
FIRST TIME THAT THAT WERE HERE

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.640
AND SO I DON'T WANT TO RE OPEN

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:20.242
OUR TAKES US OUT OPPORTUNITY TO

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:21.176
REOPEN STUFF THAT WE HAVE CUT

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.477
INTO AGREEMENT IN THE PAST AND I

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:23.612
HOPE THAT.

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:26.148
THAT WE ARE ALL -- DISCIPLINE

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:30.686
THAT WAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:33.655
FORWARD WITH IT BUT THIS BILL.

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.524
ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:38.527
POWER QUE HAN THANK YOU THERE --

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:39.428
I WANT TO START BY THINKING

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:40.028
APPROACH HIM FOR BRINGING THIS

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:40.362
BILL I THINK.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:40.963
WHAT WE NEED TO GET BACK TO IS

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:41.596
REMEMBERING THAT AT THE END OF

01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:42.497
THE DAY THIS PROTECTS OUR AIR

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:43.665
OUR WATER AND OUR ENDANGERED

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:45.434
SPECIES AND THAT'S?

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.535
AS A STATE THERE'S NO QUESTION

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:47.703
THAT THOSE ARE VALUES THAT THIS

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:49.338
BILL GOES A LONG WAY IN MAKING

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:50.872
SURE THAT THOSE RESOURCES WHICH

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:52.674
HAVE LONG BEEN PROTECTED REMAIN

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:53.942
PROTECTED DESPITE.

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:55.477
OTHERS USE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:56.611
DOESN'T NEED.

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.547
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT WHICH

01:16:58.613 --> 01:16:59.681
I I DO.

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:00.482
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:01.783
COMMENTS MADE ABOUT THE LACK OF

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:04.086
NOTICE AND COMMENT I FIND THAT.

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.487
LITTLE SURPRISING GIVEN THAT THE

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:08.924
BILL VERY CLEARLY REQUIRES IN

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:10.125
AND THAT THERE'S AT LEAST THIRTY

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:11.226
DAYS.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:14.062
OF NOTICING COMMENTS BEFORE A

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.297
VOTE IS TAKEN AGAIN.

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.165
JUST ON REGULATIONS THAT ARE AS

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:18.200
PROTECTIVE AS THE FEDERAL

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:20.435
GOVERNMENT SO I I SEE THIS AS

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.837
CONTAINING THE NECESSARY NOTICE

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:23.271
AND COMMENT THAT WAS REQUIRED

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:24.940
UNDER LAW BUT I ALSO.

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:26.074
THERE'S NO QUESTION I THINK WE

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:27.209
NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:29.945
ENVIRONMENT AS WE HAVE AND SO --

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.880
WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS --

01:17:31.947 --> 01:17:33.882
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:35.250
RESOURCES HERE THEY NEED TO BE

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.051
PROTECTED AND WATER IS ONE OF

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:38.020
THEM -- WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:39.554
NECESSARY CLEAN WATER IN OUR

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:40.555
STATE AND THE NEED TO PROTECT IT

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:42.224
AND THIS GOES A LONG WAY IN

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:43.525
DOING THAT AND IN SO DOING

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:44.559
PROTECTS THE SPECIES THAT LIVE

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.061
IN IT WHICH ARE EQUALLY AS

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.362
VALUABLE SO.

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:48.897
AND THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:49.197
[inaudible]

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:50.732

RIGHT NOW -- I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:48.710
MOSTLY ABOUT THE ENDANGERED

01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:50.078
SPECIES.

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:53.281

FIVE DAYS AND WELL I'M SORRY --

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:08.563
DOCTOR ARAMBULA.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:11.967
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOU

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:12.634
KNOW I'M WANTING TO GET INTO THE

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:15.570
WEEDS A LITTLE BIT ON THE POLICY

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:17.739
SPECIFICALLY REGARDING

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:19.307
INCIDENTAL TAKES.

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.009
YOU KNOW YOUR INITIAL COMMENT

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:23.411
WAS TO INSULATE US FROM GOING

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:26.047
BACKWARDS AND I APPRECIATE THAT

01:21:26.114 --> 01:21:27.549
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE ONE OF

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:28.516
OUR ENDED UNINTENDED

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:31.720
CONSEQUENCES AS WE CAN'T ADVANCE

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:33.221
WITH THE BEST SCIENCE WE HAVE.

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:36.124
AND SO I JUST HAVE CONCERNS AS

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:37.993
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.494
THE FACT.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:42.364
OF WHAT I THINK IS A FREEZE.

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.866
NOW WE MADE TALK ABOUT AND

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:46.601
DISAGREE ABOUT THAT BUT IT.

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:47.702
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT TAKEN

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:48.903
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS GOING

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:51.273
FORWARD THAT WE'VE FROZEN IN

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:52.474
TIME.

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:56.111
SCIENCE AND THE FALL MIDWATER

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:58.380
TRAWLS THAT OCCURS REGARDING

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:01.950
DELTA SMELT -- THERE ARE SOME

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:04.986
NEWER TECHNOLOGIES THAT I THINK

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.888
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE A

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.423
TURBIDITY BRIDGE THAT.

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:10.859
MAY DEAL MORE WITH TIMING THAN

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:12.360
IT DOES WITH ALL OR NONE.

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.194
AND WHY AND BRING IN ALL OF THIS

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.729
UP IS WATER MATTERS FOR

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:17.165
COMMUNITIES AND HOW WE GROW AND

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:19.134
HOW WE ENSURE WE HAVE ACCESS. TO

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.736
CLEAN DRINKING WATER BUT THERE

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:22.637
CO EQUAL GOALS.

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.439
AND AS WERE HAVING THIS

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:26.041
DISCUSSION.

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:28.076
IT SOUNDS AS IF YOUR INTENT WAS

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:29.311
NOT TO DISRUPT THE STATE WATER

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:30.779
PROJECT.

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:33.248
BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU DIRECTLY.

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:35.383
WHAT A CURSE?

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.918
IF THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:38.687
DIFFERENT.

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.288
WILL THERE BE A DISRUPTION TO

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:42.857
THE STATE WATER PROJECT.

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:45.827
WELL A I WILL ASK HIM MAYBE TO

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:47.896
RESPOND BUT NOT IN NOT IN TERMS

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:49.864
OF THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WHICH

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:51.232
IS WHY WE ADDED.

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:53.835
THE PIECES ABOUT ACCORDING TO

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:54.936
THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE.

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.905
ARE THE IN TERMS OF THE

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.673
VOLUNTARY WATER AGREEMENTS AND

01:22:58.740 --> 01:22:59.941
THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.543
RIGHT NOW.

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.578
I I I THINK IT IS DIFFICULT AT

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.647
BEST THE CONVERSATIONS IN

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:06.848
NEGOTIATIONS I'M GLAD TO HEAR.

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:07.916
ANA THAT SOME OF THESE

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.451
CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING WELL IN

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.019
TERMS OF THE DIRECTION WE'RE

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:14.522
TRYING TO GO -- BUT NOT.

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:16.524
DUE TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:18.126
WE ARE IT TRYING TO INCLUDE TO

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:20.462
LEAVE THE FLEXIBILITY OUT

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:21.996
WHETHER IT'S RELATED TO THE THE

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:23.098
SCIENCE.

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:25.600
OR AS ITS ROUTE RELATES TO THE

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.202
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OUT WE

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:28.536
WANT THE FLEXIBILITY WE DON'T

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:30.772
WANT TO CUT OFF THE ABILITY TO

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:33.575
HAVE BETTER STANDARDS OR ARE.

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:36.444
BETTER AT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.580
TO US WE JUST WHAT WE ARE

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.315
OPERATING FROM A BASS.

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.783
AND AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.318
WILL GET TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:45.019
REVIEW PROCESS I KNOW.

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:47.589
BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- AT

01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:49.257
WERE SETTING RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:51.025
AND TRYING TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:53.094
SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CONTINUE

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:55.697
TO HAVE THESE NEGOTIATIONS AS IT

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:56.998
RELATES TO FULLY IMPLEMENTING.

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:58.500
OUR WHAT WE HAVEN'T YET BEEN

01:23:58.566 --> 01:23:59.901
ABLE TO DO WERE STILL IN

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.302
CONVERSATIONS ON MANY OF THESE

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:02.103
VOLUNTARY.

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.838
AGREEMENTS WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN

01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:05.340
THERE WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:06.708
CONTINUING TO HAVE MEETING SO

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:08.643
WE'VE TRIED TO PUT IN HERE AND

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:09.944
I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY.

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:12.447
OR A BIOLOGIST I AM A LAY PERSON

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.182
THAT IS LOOKING A COMMON SENSE

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:15.617
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ARE

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.485
NOT PRECLUDING I'VE BEEN ENGAGED

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:18.820
IN THESE CONVERSATIONS SINCE WE

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:20.188
DID THE WATER BOND.

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:22.657
TOGETHER AT WITH ALL OF THE

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.392
PARTIES TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:27.395
WE ARE KEEPING OUR OPTIONS OPEN

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:30.465
AND NOT FOR CLOSING OUR LOSING

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:31.733
ANY OPPORTUNITIES WHEN IT IS

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.468
ABOUT HOW WE ARE.

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:35.370
TRYING TO GET MORE WATER ALL

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:38.239
ACROSS OUR STATE AND THE BAY

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:44.579
DELTA PLAN AND THE ISSUES ARE

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:44.779
THERE.

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:45.847
YOU KNOW WE'VE HAVE LONG

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:46.448
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN SOUTHERN

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:47.015
CALIFORNIA THE BAY AREA AND

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:48.016
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET THIS

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:49.484
BILL TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL

01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:52.387
OF THOSE LONG TERM DISCUSSIONS.

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:53.788
WE ARE JUST SETTING BASELINE

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.557
STANDARDS TO PROTECT WHAT WE

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:57.225
HAVE IN PLACE.

01:24:57.292 --> 01:24:59.127
AND ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY AND

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:01.129
THE BEST SCIENCE AND A REVIEW

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:03.898
PROCESS THAT DOESN'T START OVER.

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:06.167
I WITH A YOU KNOW AND CREATE

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:07.836

AND CENTRAL VALLEY STILL HEAD.

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:17.091
AND THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEED TO

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:19.260
LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS PREVIOUS

01:28:19.327 --> 01:28:21.896
STANDARDS THAT WERE UNDER THE

TO TRY.

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.752
TO FIGURE A WAY FORWARD BECAUSE

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:20.521
AS I STATED BEFORE OUR INTENT IS

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:21.189
NOT TO FREEZE.

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:23.391
THIS IS A SCIENCE BECAUSE YOU

TRAWLS ISSUE AND THE THAT HAS

01:29:26.227 --> 01:29:28.129
BEEN CHANGED SINCE THE TWO

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:28.663
THOUSAND EIGHT BIOLOGICAL

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:31.199
OPINION OKAY I THINK WE'VE

JUST RIGHT ABSOLUTELY ALL RIGHT

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.176
I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN ABOUT AS

01:29:42.243 --> 01:29:43.277
FAR AS WE CAN IF YOU WANT TO

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:45.279
TAKE ONE MINUTE TO SUMMARIZE

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:47.048
OPPOSITION.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:48.149
YES WHERE DOES REMAIN REALLY

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:49.784
CONCERNED WE WE THINK THERE'S

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:51.018
ALREADY A STATE LOTTO DRESS

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:52.320
STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES IF

01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:53.688
THERE'S ISSUES WITH THE FEDERAL

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:55.022
PERMIT IT'S NOT REMOVING THE

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:56.824
SPECIES FROM LISTING IT JUST MAY

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.292
BE CHANGING THE CRITERIA.

01:29:58.359 --> 01:29:59.894
BASED ON BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:02.096
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS -- AND AND

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:04.132
WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNTIL WE CAN

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:04.966
ADDRESS THE ISSUE WHERE THIS

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:08.836
BILL FILLED VERY TARGETED TO THE

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.838
STATE WATER PROJECT SPECIFICALLY.

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:11.672
ALL THIS AT ONE POINT THE THE

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:14.542
BILL CREATES A STARED THAT SAYS.

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:16.577
WHETHER THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

01:30:16.644 --> 01:30:18.045
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE MORE OR

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:18.980
LESS PROTECTIVE IT'S AN

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:20.915
UNDEFINED TERMS TO THE AGENCIES

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.283
MAY USE THE BEST AVAILABLE

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:24.552
SCIENCE BUT THE BILL GIVES

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:25.153
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SUCH

01:30:25.219 --> 01:30:25.987
THAT.

01:30:26.053 --> 01:30:27.421
CITIZENS CAN FORCE WHETHER THEY

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:28.790
AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH WHAT'S

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.124
MORE LESS PROTECTIVE AND THE

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:31.492
ISSUE IS.

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:33.060
THE AGENCIES WILL BE AT RISK OF

01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:34.362
BEING SUED EITHER WAY BECAUSE

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:35.930
THIS BILL CREATES A NEW STANDARD

01:30:35.997 --> 01:30:37.765
AND FORCED BY CITIZENS AND

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:38.966
THAT'S THE ISSUE IT DOESN'T STAY

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:40.368
IN THE BILL IT FREEZES THAT.

01:30:40.434 --> 01:30:42.069
IT CREATES A LEGAL STANDARD

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:43.838
WHICH BECAUSE YOUR PRIVATE RIGHT

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.139
OF ACTION FORCE MEANT.

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:47.141
WILL ALLOW ME MAY NOT BE AN RTC

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:48.075
OR MAY NOT BE YOU KNOW ANYONE

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.343
HERE THE TABLE BUT IT ALLOWS

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:52.013
ANYBODY ANY CITIZEN TO ENFORCE.

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:53.481
WHAT THEY AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:55.216
WHAT'S MORE LESS PROTECTIVE AND

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:57.218
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE?

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.753
ALL RIGHT I I THINK WE'VE WE'VE

01:30:58.820 --> 01:30:59.453
HEARD ENOUGH.

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.255

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.360
WE'LL TRY AND GET THE NOW OKAY

01:31:06.427 --> 01:31:10.298
FINE I THINK WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:14.702
THIS CLEARLY ARE GOES BEYOND --

01:31:14.769 --> 01:31:16.070
WELL.

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:17.405
LET'S HOPE THE SECRETARY CAN GET

01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:19.607
YOU BOTH TOGETHER.

MATERIALS POINT OF VIEW THIS

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:27.782
BILL IS GREAT -- I DO ONE HERE

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:29.317
ON THE NOTICE QUESTIONS SO IF

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.785
YOU COULD TAKE ONE MINUTE TO SAY

01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:33.087
WHY YOU WANT THE FIVE DAYS

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.388
RATHER THAN THIRTY DAYS.

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:36.290

THE RECORD THE BILL STRUCTURED

01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:40.795
SUCH THAT.

01:31:40.862 --> 01:31:42.964
THE AGENCIES ARE REVIEWING ON A

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:45.032
QUARTERLY BASIS IF THERE'S A

DETERMINATION THEY PROMULGATE A

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:48.669
LIST AND IT JUST SAYS THIS

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:50.571
STANDARD IS MORE THEY BELIEVE

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:51.606
IT'S MORE OR LESS PROTECTIVE.

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:53.274
THE ACTUAL PROMULGATION OF RULE

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:54.275
MAKING WHERE THEY FOLD IN

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.010

ACTUAL PROMULGATION OF THE RULE

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:18.933
MAKING THE UPPER DOWN LIST OF

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:19.433
WHETHER IT'S MORE LESS

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:20.034
PROTECTIVE.

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.235
IS NOT THE MEAT AND BONES OF

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:22.403
WHAT THE AGENCIES WILL BE DOING

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:23.571
THAT'S JUST WE THINK THIS IS

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:24.805
MORE OR LESS PROTECTIVE.

01:32:24.872 --> 01:32:26.140
THE ACTUAL FOLDING OF THAT

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:28.142
FEDERAL LAW INTO CALIFORNIA LAW

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:29.610

01:32:38.152 --> 01:32:40.054
THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY IN THE BILL.

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:40.955
ALL RIGHT.

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:41.589
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE COMMENT ON

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:43.291

FOR A FEW WILL COMMENT ON THAT

01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:46.460
BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN.

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:48.930
A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION OKAY

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:49.764
GO AHEAD MISS MILLER CHAIRMAN

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.198
KIBLER PER THE PRO TEM'S OFFICE

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:53.267
OUT TWO THINGS ONE IS I WANT TO

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:53.734
REMIND THE COMMITTEE.

01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:55.603
THIS BILL IS.

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:57.204
BLOCKING ARE PUTTING IN PLACE

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:59.073
THE EXISTING FEDERAL BASELINE

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.741
STANDARDS THAT HAVE EXISTED IN

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:03.010
MANY CASES FOR DECADES AND BEEN

01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:04.412
THROUGH NOT JUST EXTENSIVE

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:06.113
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS.

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.582
BUT ALSO LITIGATION AND SO THE

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:09.984
PREMISE OF THE BILLS TO SAY

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:11.819
WHERE THE AGENCY IS ADOPTING

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:13.854
ESSENTIALLY THAT SAME STANDARD

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:14.822
THAT HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:15.790
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:17.058
AND IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE ON

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:20.027
PAGE SEVEN LINES TWENTY FIVE

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:21.195
THREE TWENTY SEVEN WHERE IT SAYS.

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:22.496
IF THE FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARD

01:33:22.563 --> 01:33:24.465
AS ADOPTED WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:26.801
MODIFICATION THAN IT IS TRUE YOU

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:28.002
GET A THIRTY DAY NOTICE AND YOU

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:29.203
CAN COMMENT.

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.273
THE I THINK THE OPPONENTS ARE --

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.275
CONFLATING THAT WITH A FULL

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:35.109
BLOWN RULE MAKING IN OTHER WORDS

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:37.011
AN AGENCY THAT IS INVENTING OR

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:37.745
STARTING.

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:39.780
IMPLEMENT A LAW AND SO THE IDEA

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.082
HERE IS IF IT'S JUST SIMPLY

01:33:41.148 --> 01:33:43.551
PUTTING INTO REGULATION AN

01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:44.819
EXISTING FEDERAL BASELINE

01:33:44.885 --> 01:33:46.320
STANDARD THAT HAS EXISTED FOR A

01:33:46.387 --> 01:33:47.288
LONG TIME.

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:48.255
THERE SHOULD BE A SHORTER

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:49.957
PROCESS OTHERWISE YOU SET UP

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:52.159
LITIGATION YOU SET UP DELAYS AS

01:33:52.226 --> 01:33:53.327
WE ALL KNOW THE RULE MAKING

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:54.662
PROCESS CAN TAKE TIME.

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.330
IF THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:58.199
HOWEVER THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT

01:33:58.265 --> 01:33:59.433
YOU WOULD GO THROUGH THE FULL

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.602
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE PROCESS

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:03.237
THAT'S THE DISTINCTION HERE.

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:09.443
OKAY THANK YOU -- PERHAPS WE

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:10.878
COULD HAVE ONE MINUTE ON THE

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:12.580
TROPHY QUESTION.

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:14.749
AND THEN NOW A RESPONSE AND THEN

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:16.784
HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO A VOTE

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:19.153
ON THE BILL.

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.955
AT WITH ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:22.690
DID YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS

01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:24.959
MADAM VICE CHAIR.

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:25.159
NOW.

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:26.260
ARE YOU DO.

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:27.695
ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES PART

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:33.401
OR I'M JUST HAVING TROUBLE

01:34:33.467 --> 01:34:35.803
FALLING.

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:39.707
THE OBJECT HERE IS WORKING.

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:41.275
WHEN THEY'RE DONE I WILL?

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:43.310
FIND MY QUESTION [inaudible]

01:34:43.377 --> 01:34:45.579
ALL RIGHT.

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:46.647
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NOEL

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:47.381
CREAMERS OF CALIFORNIA FARM

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:48.049
BUREAU.

01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:52.586
SO SECTION ONE OF THE BILL.

01:34:52.653 --> 01:34:54.121
WAS ADDED IN ITS TREATED

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.423
DIFFERENTLY THAN THE REST OF THE

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:56.724
BILL AND THAT IT DOESN'T SUNSET

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:58.726
SO THIS IS A PERMANENT PROVISION.

01:34:58.793 --> 01:35:01.162
THAT.

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:03.564
WAS DESCRIBED AS A WAY TO GET AT

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:05.966
THE CONCERN ABOUT THE ROLE BACK

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:07.501
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THE

01:35:07.568 --> 01:35:09.870
IMPORTATION OF TROPHY HUNTED

01:35:09.937 --> 01:35:11.906
WILDLIFE.

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:14.408
AND BRINGING SO AN ELEPHANT THAT

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:17.745
SKILLED IN AFRICA BACK INTO --

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:19.880
CALIFORNIA.

01:35:19.947 --> 01:35:21.615
THE ISSUE WITH THE LANGUAGE

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:24.518
THOUGH IS THAT IT GIVES.

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:26.120
THE AUTHORITY ESSENTIALLY TO

01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:27.621
EVERY OTHER STATE AND FOREIGN

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:30.191
GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL ACTIONS IN

01:35:30.257 --> 01:35:31.625
CALIFORNIA.

01:35:31.692 --> 01:35:34.061
BY SAYING THAT IT IS PERHAPS IT

01:35:34.128 --> 01:35:35.529
TO TRANSPORT CELL RECEIVE

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:37.264
ACQUIRE OR PURCHASE ANY FISH

01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:38.766
WILDLIFE OR PLANT TAKEN POSSESS

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:40.534
TRANSPORTED OR SOLD IN VIOLATION

01:35:40.601 --> 01:35:41.969
OF ANY LAW OR REGULATION OF ANY

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:42.937
OTHER STATE.

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:44.305
OR FOREIGN LAW.

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:47.274
SO THAT COULD MEAN THAT BECAUSE

01:35:47.341 --> 01:35:50.277
MASSACHUSETTS PROHIBITS.

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:52.079
THE BRINGING OF FIRE WOOD INTO

01:35:52.146 --> 01:35:54.515
STATE PARKS THAT CALIFORNIA THEN

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:59.120
YOU WOULD BE TRANSPORTING.

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:01.088
BASED ON THE WAY SECTION ONE IS

01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:02.590
DESCRIBED IS THAT IT'S DEALING

01:36:02.656 --> 01:36:03.991
WITH.

01:36:04.058 --> 01:36:05.659
THE PREVENTION OF TROPHY HUNTING.

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:07.862
WE BELIEVE THAT THAT SECTION

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:11.198
NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON THE LAW

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:12.867
THAT DEALS WITH TROPHY HUNTING

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.602
AND SPECIFICALLY LIMITED TO HAVE

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:15.202
THAT.

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:17.104
RATHER THAN HAVING THESE BROADLY

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:18.839
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:20.107
RESTRICTING ACTIVITIES IN

01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:21.876
CALIFORNIA JUST BECAUSE ANOTHER

01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:24.178
STATE HAS SET A DIFFERENT RULE

01:36:24.245 --> 01:36:25.546
OR A DIFFERENT STANDARD AND WE

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.815
HAVE AN EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED

01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:30.151
THAT UNDER STATE LAW.

01:36:30.217 --> 01:36:32.153
ALL RIGHT AND THEN KIM.

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:32.786
AND TRY TO MAKE IT TO MY WILL

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.722
YES I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF.

01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:40.928
SO -- SECTION A OF SECTION.

01:36:40.995 --> 01:36:42.429
ONE DOES DO WHAT.

01:36:42.496 --> 01:36:44.665
IT IS SPECIFIC TO THE

01:36:44.732 --> 01:36:47.234
IMPORTATION OF WILDLIFE AND IT

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:48.769
IS FOR THE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:50.304
AT THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING

01:36:50.371 --> 01:36:51.405
RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THIS CURRENT

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:52.706
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ROLLED

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:53.641
BACK RULES.

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:54.808
THAT WOULD HAVE PROHIBITED THE

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.977
IMPORTATION OF NOT JUST ELEPHANT

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:58.512
PARTS BUT ALSO LINE PARTS.

01:36:58.579 --> 01:37:00.481
ON THAT IS THAT WOULD THAT WHAT

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:02.516
WERE PREVIOUSLY PROHIBITED UNDER

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:03.951
THE FOR THE PAST FEDERAL

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:05.352
ADMINISTRATION.

01:37:05.419 --> 01:37:08.522
THE SECOND SECTION SECTION BE

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:11.258
WAS WRITTEN -- SIMILARLY WITH A

01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:12.893
SIMILAR INTENT BECAUSE IT'S

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.828
REFERRING TO BOTH STATE AND

01:37:14.895 --> 01:37:16.997
INTERNET AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:18.699
SO IT'S THE WAY THE PROVISION

01:37:18.766 --> 01:37:21.235
WAS WRITTEN SO VERY SIMILAR TO

01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:22.836
THE FEDERAL LACEY ACT.

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:24.371
WHICH ALL THAT BILL ALL THAT

01:37:24.438 --> 01:37:26.407
SECTION DOES IS IT'S TO ACQUIRE

01:37:26.473 --> 01:37:28.642
A CORD A RESPECT FOR THE LAWS OF

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:31.345
OTHER STATES AND FOREIGN NATIONS.

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:33.380
AND THAT YOU CANNOT ILLEGALLY

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:35.015
BRING IN ILLEGALLY SOURCED

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:36.784
PRODUCTS THAT SO THAT'S WHAT IT

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:39.253
IS IT DOES IT'S NOT INTENDED AND

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.522
AND IT TO SAY THAT MASSACHUSETTS

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:42.823
LAW CERTAINLY APPLIES TO

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:44.458
CALIFORNIA IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT.

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:45.559
IF SOMETHING IS SOURCED IN

01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:48.229
MASSACHUSETTS ILLEGALLY UNDER

01:37:48.295 --> 01:37:49.396
MASS ILLEGALLY UNDER

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:50.431
MASSACHUSETTS LAW YOU CANNOT

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:52.600
BRING IT IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:54.001
WE'RE NOT HERE.

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:55.569
TO UP WE KNOW OF PROMOTE

01:37:55.636 --> 01:37:58.172
VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND

01:37:58.239 --> 01:37:59.440
INTERNATIONAL LAW.

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:01.242
THAT'S THAT IS HOW IT'S BEEN

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:03.344
READ UNDER THE FEDERAL LACEY ACT

01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:04.478
FOR YEARS AND DECADES AND

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:06.480
DECADES WE ARE HAPPY TO MAKE

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:08.515
WHATEVER CHANGES WE NEED TO TO

01:38:08.582 --> 01:38:09.917
THIS PROVISION TO MAKE THAT

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:10.884
CLEAR.

01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:13.087
ON THAT IT IS A SOURCING ISSUE

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:15.422
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA VERSUS

01:38:15.489 --> 01:38:16.824
SOMEHOW DICTATING IN CHANGING

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:18.359
CALIFORNIA LAW AND WE'VE

01:38:18.425 --> 01:38:19.660
ACTUALLY ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF

POINT IS.

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:24.591
HOW MANY -- AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN

01:39:24.658 --> 01:39:27.027

SO HOW MANY AMENDMENTS SO FAR

01:39:34.601 --> 01:39:36.437
HAVE BEEN TAKEN.

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:37.438
HERE'S A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:40.607

TRYING TO SEE BY.

SO TWENTY AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:46.847
TAKEN BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:50.317
STOLEN OFF A LOT OF OPPOSITION --

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:53.387
ARE YOU HOPEFUL THAT.

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:54.855
YOU ARE GOING TO COME TO SOME

01:39:54.922 --> 01:39:56.523
SORT OF AGREEMENT WHERE EVERYONE

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:58.258
IS SATISFIED OR AT LEAST SOME.

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.260
LEVEL OF COMFORT IS ACHIEVED ON

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:02.830
BOTH SIDES BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:05.299
ISSUE -- AND ENNIS AND BEFORE

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:07.267
YOU ANSWER THAT LET ME JUST SAY

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:09.470
THAT -- YOU KNOW I THINK

01:40:09.536 --> 01:40:11.705
TYPICALLY -- PERHAPS THOSE ON

01:40:11.772 --> 01:40:13.407
YOUR SIDE OF THE AISLE DON'T

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:16.143
FEEL THAT -- THOSE ON MY SIDE OF

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:17.378
THE AISLE ARE NECESSARILY --

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:18.979
PERHAPS WE COULD.

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:20.848
THIS IS NOT WHAT WHAT WHAT WE

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:24.518
ALL RESPECT TO HONEST.

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:24.718
WE DO.

01:40:24.785 --> 01:40:27.187
ON THIS IS NOT NO I KNOW

DO WITH RESPECT I'M OLD I'M JUST

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:30.891
TRYING TO POINT OUT SOME.

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:32.459
SOME DIFFERENCES THAT I THINK

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:34.061
ARE OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE THIS

01:40:34.128 --> 01:40:35.829
IT'S NOT A COMBATIVE OKAY

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:40.534
CONVERSATION SO -- I THINK THAT

01:40:40.601 --> 01:40:42.403
WE HAVE GROWN USED -- TO HAVING

01:40:42.469 --> 01:40:44.171
VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:45.672
ISSUES LIKE THIS BUT WHEN IN

01:40:45.739 --> 01:40:49.510
FACT WE ARE -- A LOT OF TIMES IN

01:40:49.576 --> 01:40:51.311
ALIGNMENT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:53.647
ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:55.015
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES -- TO

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:56.683
THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN

01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:57.951
CALIFORNIA SINCE WE ARE.

01:40:58.018 --> 01:40:59.787
WERE OWN ANIMAL HERE RIGHT IN

01:40:59.853 --> 01:41:01.355
THIS IN THIS COUNTRY BUT I HAVE

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:03.657
GREAT CONCERN.

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:05.125
THE AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION THAT

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:06.627
STILL EXISTS GIVEN THAT THERE'S

01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:07.995
BEEN TWENTY AMENDMENTS AND GIVEN

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:09.930
THAT THERE'S BEEN FOR COMMITTEE

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:10.998
HAS I JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM

01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:12.099
YOU.

01:41:12.166 --> 01:41:13.767
DIRECTLY -- WHAT KIND YOUR

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:15.102
OUTLOOK IS FOR THIS AS IT GOES

01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:16.303
THROUGH AT LEAST TWO MORE

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:20.941
HEARINGS M. IN THE ASSEMBLY?

01:41:21.008 --> 01:41:22.676
THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR -- AT

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:23.811
YOU KNOW I I KNEW WHEN I TOOK ON

01:41:23.877 --> 01:41:25.879
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:27.548
IT WAS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:30.584
BECAUSE IT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:32.386
IT DISTINCT ISSUES CLEAN AIR

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:33.654
CLEAN WATER.

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.590
AS YOU SAW EVIDENCE HERE TODAY --

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:38.459
WE'RE WE'RE STILL HAVING ISSUES

01:41:38.525 --> 01:41:39.460
BETWEEN THE FEDERAL WATER

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:42.029
PROJECT AND STATE WATER PRICE WE

01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:43.530
HAVE HAVE ALWAYS HAD THOSE

01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:44.932
ISSUES SO.

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:46.967
THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:49.970
ADDRESS THE EXISTING DIALOGUE

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:51.738
THAT HAS GONE ON FOR THE WHOLE

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:53.507
TIME THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN THE

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:55.609
LEGISLATURE AND EVEN BEFORE --

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:57.878
THAT YOU KNOW I HAVE TO TRUST MY

01:41:57.945 --> 01:41:58.579
ANA.

01:41:58.645 --> 01:42:00.581
REPUTATION RECORD OF TRYING TO

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:02.082
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER I THINK

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:03.717
THE REASON YOU HAVE --

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:05.252
INDIVIDUALS GETTING INTO THE

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:06.887
WEEDS HERE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:08.489
SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOING THAT

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:09.890
AND WE ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT ON A

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:11.291
NUMBER OF THINGS.

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:13.527
BUT WE HAVE MOVED ON QUITE A LOT

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:14.661
OF THINGS.

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:18.031
I THINK THAT PART OF THE AND TO

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:20.501
BE COMPLETELY HONEST AS I KNOW

01:42:20.567 --> 01:42:22.302
YOU ALWAYS ARE.

01:42:22.369 --> 01:42:24.304
A LOT OF THE ISSUES HERE -- STEM

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:25.472
ON THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:26.740
PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.942
THESE THINGS ROLLED BACK BECAUSE

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:31.378
IT IS THE IT YOU KNOW IT TOOK A

01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:33.413
LOT TO GET THESE OUT LAWS AND

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.516
REGULATIONS INTO PLACE TO BEGIN

01:42:35.582 --> 01:42:36.750
WITH.

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:38.318
AND TO FRANKLY HAVEN'T AN

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.753
ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.688
THAT IS SEEKING TO UNDO SOME OF

01:42:41.755 --> 01:42:44.558
THOSE THINGS THAT IS THE CRUX.

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:46.894
OF IT AND I WANT TO AVOID ALL OF

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.295
THAT I'M I DON'T CALL THIS

01:42:48.362 --> 01:42:50.764
INSURANCE SOME PEOPLE DO.

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:53.066
I CALL THIS A PRESERVATION OF

01:42:53.133 --> 01:42:55.869
WHAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE SUPPORTED

01:42:55.936 --> 01:42:57.905
AND PUT INTO PLACE AND THAT'S

01:42:57.971 --> 01:42:59.540
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IN

01:42:59.606 --> 01:43:00.741
PLACE.

01:43:00.807 --> 01:43:03.076
I ALLOWING.

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:04.578
FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE SCIENCE

01:43:04.645 --> 01:43:06.280
ARE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

01:43:06.346 --> 01:43:07.681
FOR CLOSING OPPORTUNITIES.

01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:10.217
I UNDERSTAND HOW IT FEELS TO BE

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:11.585
HERE AND HAVE THESE DISTINCT.

01:43:11.652 --> 01:43:15.489
OF POSITIONS -- BUT I WILL JUST

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:20.027
HAVE TO GO ON THE THE BELIEF

01:43:20.093 --> 01:43:20.627
THAT I HAVE THAT WE CAN GET AS

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:21.461
CLOSE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN WE WILL

01:43:21.528 --> 01:43:23.063
NOT TAKE ALL THE OPPOSITION OFF.

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:24.798
I HEAR THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:27.000
OF OUR AGENCIES AND

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:28.368
ORGANIZATIONS HERE THAT ARE

01:43:28.435 --> 01:43:30.637
MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WATER.

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:32.940
PIECES ARE I WOULD EXPECT NO

01:43:33.006 --> 01:43:35.042
LESS GIVEN WHAT WE'VE HAD TO

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:36.476
DEAL WITH IN THE STATE.

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:38.178
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH EAST TO WEST

01:43:38.245 --> 01:43:40.581
CENTRAL SO I WILL DO MY VERY

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:41.882
BEST VICE CHAIRMAN.

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:44.351
VICE CHAIRWOMAN BUT I WE MAY NOT

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:46.453
GET THERE BUT IT WON'T BE FOR

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.688
LACK OF TRYING.

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:49.790
CAN I TAKE THAT ISSUE CLOTHES

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:54.828
YES -- GOOD -- WAIT I'M SORRY MR

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:58.098
MATHIS.

01:43:58.165 --> 01:43:59.733
EVEN AS OF TOMORROW AT APPROACH

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.501
AND THAT IS A GREAT CLOSE.

01:44:01.568 --> 01:44:04.004
OF MY CONCERNS ARE JUST.

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:05.739
WITH THE BROAD SWEEPING

01:44:05.806 --> 01:44:06.039
[inaudible]

01:44:06.106 --> 01:44:08.108
APPROACH.

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:09.576
WITH EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:10.410
ENDANGERED SPECIES AND

01:44:10.477 --> 01:44:11.478
EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN THIS IS

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:14.281
CALIFORNIA WE'VE NEVER BEEN SHY

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:15.749
ABOUT PASSING LAWS.

01:44:15.816 --> 01:44:17.918
SO WHY TAKE THE BROADER APPROACH

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:20.621
WAYNE IF THE ADMINISTRATION WAS

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:22.255
TO DO SOMETHING OR IF.

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:24.591
THEIR BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS CHANGE

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:27.160
THEN WE COULD ACT WITH URGENCY.

01:44:27.227 --> 01:44:30.530
VERSUS DOING SUCH A BROAD.

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:33.000
BASED APPROACH IN RAISING ALL

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:34.968
THE CONCERNS AND ALL THE RED

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:36.069
FLAGS AND OF HAPPENED.

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:37.204
I I AND I KNOW WE'VE DONE

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:38.772
SEVERALTHINGS BEFORE WHERE WE

01:44:38.839 --> 01:44:41.241
CAN DO AN URGENCY BILL.

01:44:41.308 --> 01:44:42.943
AND GET IT THROUGH VERY QUICKLY

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:45.178
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.

01:44:45.245 --> 01:44:47.214
AND I UNDERSTAND TRYING TO GET

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.415
AHEAD OF IT.

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:49.816
BLOOD I MEAN THAT'S JUST KIND OF

01:44:49.883 --> 01:44:51.385
MY CONCERN ON ON WHY YOU'RE

01:44:51.451 --> 01:44:53.620
TAKING ON SUCH A TASK WHEN WE

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:55.922
HAVE THE ABILITY -- AND ARE

01:44:55.989 --> 01:44:59.593
LEGISLATIVE BODY HERE'S NEVER

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:00.560
BEEN SHY ABOUT IT.

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:01.828
I I WOULD SAY IT IS A BROAD BILL

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:02.996
BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.364
MULTIPLE ISSUES.

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:07.267
CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND I HIT

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:10.671
WORKER PROTECTIONS -- IT IS NOT

01:45:10.737 --> 01:45:13.040
BROAD IN TERMS OF OF US TRYING

01:45:13.106 --> 01:45:15.308
TO BROADEN THE LAW SPECIFICALLY

CODIFIES MANY OF THE STANDARDS

01:54:32.865 --> 01:54:33.766

01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:35.201
CALIFORNIA STANDARDS THAT WERE

01:55:09.569 --> 01:55:10.770
LOT OF WORK OVER THE LAST

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:12.105
SEVERAL YEARS AND REDUCING

01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:14.574
CHILDREN'S EXPOSURE TO LEAD.

01:55:14.641 --> 01:55:17.210
AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:19.412
WHO BEEN LET EXPOSED -- THIS

01:55:19.479 --> 01:55:20.847
CONCERN HAS BEEN PRIMARY HAS

01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:22.615
BEEN IN LARGE PART FUELED BY THE

01:55:22.682 --> 01:55:23.916
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL'S

01:55:23.983 --> 01:55:24.684
ASSERTION.

01:55:24.751 --> 01:55:26.252
THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:28.788
LEAD IN CHILDREN'S BLOOD.

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:30.490
AND WE OF COURSE KNOW WITHOUT

01:55:30.556 --> 01:55:31.691
GETTING TO ADD INTO ALL THE

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:33.593
DETAILS ABOUT LEAD EXPOSURE

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:34.227
WHICH WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH AT

01:55:34.294 --> 01:55:35.528
THIS POINT.

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:37.697
JUST TO REMIND FOLKS THAT --

01:55:37.764 --> 01:55:38.865
LEAD CAN AFFECT NEARLY EVERY

01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:40.633
SYSTEM IN THE BODY AND EVEN JUST

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:42.769
A LITTLE BIT OF LEAD CAN AFFECT

01:55:42.835 --> 01:55:44.604
A CHILD'S AUG I Q..

01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:46.439
AND FRIENDS FOR INSTANCE THE CAT

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:47.573
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:49.309
ATTRIBUTES ONE IN FIVE CASES OF

01:55:49.375 --> 01:55:51.811
CHILDHOOD ADHD. TO LEAD EXPOSURE

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:56.115
AND WE DO KNOW THAT LEADS DAMAGE

01:55:56.182 --> 01:55:57.016
IS IRREVERSIBLE.

01:55:57.083 --> 01:55:58.251
CADMIUM OF COURSE TO HAVE A HOST

01:55:58.318 --> 01:56:00.186
OF HEALTH EFFECTS AND CAN DAMAGE

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.788
MANY ORGANS IN THE BODY SO IT'S

01:56:01.854 --> 01:56:03.222
NOT A SURPRISE.

01:56:03.289 --> 01:56:05.191
THAT DPH CONTINUES TO WARN

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:07.327
PARENTS AGAINST -- LETTING

01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:08.861
CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO JEWELRY

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:10.163
BECAUSE IT IS A SOURCE OF LEAD

01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:11.097
EXPOSURE.

01:56:11.164 --> 01:56:14.334
AND ALSO IT INSTRUCTS DOCTORS TO

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.569
USE ACCESS TO JEWELRY AS A RISK

01:56:16.636 --> 01:56:18.104
FACTOR WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:20.573
OR NOT TO TEST CHILDREN. FOR TO

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:23.109
BLOOD TEST CHILDREN FOR LEAD

01:56:23.176 --> 01:56:25.578
EXPOSURE -- ALONG THESE LINES

01:56:25.645 --> 01:56:28.047
JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT.

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:30.116
WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE STANDARDS

01:56:30.183 --> 01:56:31.551
OF THIS BILL ARE.

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:32.418
REASONABLE THAT CAN BE CUT THAT

01:56:32.485 --> 01:56:33.786
THEY CAN BE THE INDUSTRY CAN

01:56:33.853 --> 01:56:35.788
COMPLY WITH THEM BECAUSE RECENT

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:37.090

MAJORITY OF JEWELRY PIECES SOLD

IN CALIFORNIA AT LEAST OF THE OF

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:47.633
THE HUNDREDS THAT WERE TESTED.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.635
COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF

01:56:49.702 --> 01:56:52.438
THIS BILL -- AND SO AGAIN WE

CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IS

01:58:57.897 --> 01:59:00.600

BE BANNING LEAD AND COSMETICS

01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:11.310
ALSO BUT COULD YOU TALK ABOUT --

01:59:11.377 --> 01:59:13.012
OUT WHY THE GREEN CHEMISTRY A

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:15.448
PROGRAM IS INADEQUATE TO ADDRESS

01:59:15.515 --> 01:59:18.751

CALIFORNIA IN THAT IT ALLOWS.

01:59:27.493 --> 01:59:29.328
ESTABLISH THE PROGRAM WHERE WE

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:30.863
PRODUCTS CAN BE TAKEN UP AND

01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:33.266
REVIEWED AND AND HAZARDOUS

01:59:33.332 --> 01:59:34.800
INGREDIENTS IDENTIFIED WITHIN

01:59:34.867 --> 01:59:35.968
THEM.

01:59:36.035 --> 01:59:36.936
HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THERE IS

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:38.538
JUST A SLEW OF HAZARDOUS

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:40.973
INGREDIENTS IN MANY MANY

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.775
DIFFERENT CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:45.311
AND LEAD IS ONE EXAMPLE OF AN

01:59:45.378 --> 01:59:46.712
INGREDIENT THAT.

01:59:46.779 --> 01:59:48.748
THERE'S UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN

01:59:48.814 --> 01:59:52.251

01:59:54.854 --> 01:59:56.022
HERBAL.

AND SO -- AND AND YET.

01:59:58.925 --> 02:00:02.194
OUR ABILITY TO TACKLE THAT IS IS

02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:04.330
IS LIMITED -- GIVEN THAT THERE

02:00:04.397 --> 02:00:05.665

02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:07.366
THAT DEPARTMENT TO DO WHEN THIS

02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:10.303
IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF

02:00:10.369 --> 02:00:11.404
LEGISLATION THE LEGISLATURE

02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:13.172

OF THEM WAS CITED BY THE WATER

02:03:47.419 --> 02:03:51.223
BOARD -- FOR FOR THE THE FACT

02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:53.459

FORMALDEHYDE IN THE TANK AND

02:03:57.797 --> 02:03:59.331
WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS PART OF

02:03:59.398 --> 02:04:02.134
THE RESEARCH IS THAT -- RV'S USE

02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:04.236
THIS CHEMICAL COMPONENT IN THERE

02:04:04.303 --> 02:04:06.672
ARE V. TANKS SO THAT THAT THEY

02:04:06.739 --> 02:04:08.340
THE SO THAT THEY DON'T SMELL.

AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT BREAKS UP

02:04:10.176 --> 02:04:11.343
THE THAT THE CHEMICAL

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:13.512
DECOMPOSITION OF THE WASTE WATER

02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:14.947

02:04:15.014 --> 02:04:17.349
THE RV PARKS -- WHO ARE ALL ON

02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:19.985
SEPTIC TANKS -- THERE THIS

02:04:20.052 --> 02:04:22.988
CHEMICAL STOPS THE CHEMICAL.

02:04:23.055 --> 02:04:24.490
IN THE R. V. TANKS IT'S USED TO

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:26.559
BREAK DOWN THAT THAT THE SEWAGE

02:04:26.625 --> 02:04:28.661
AND TO BE ABLE TO TO PULL THE

02:04:28.727 --> 02:04:30.129
WATER OUT IN THE END LEAVE THIS

02:04:30.196 --> 02:04:32.198
LIFE BEHIND SO -- BUT WHAT WE

02:04:32.264 --> 02:04:33.599
DISCOVERED IS IT THE SAME

02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:35.134

THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS IN OUR V.

02:04:44.343 --> 02:04:47.079
TANKS WHICH WOULD THEN SAVE US.

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:48.848
FROM THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE

AND PUTTING IN AN ORDINANCE

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:55.901
BURDEN ON THEM FOR POLLUTERS

02:12:55.967 --> 02:12:57.369
THAT DON'T COMPLY.

02:12:57.436 --> 02:12:59.037
AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THIS

02:12:59.104 --> 02:13:02.140
EXTRAORDINARY BURDEN ON CITIES

02:13:02.207 --> 02:13:04.710
THAT GAVE THEM INDIGESTION

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:07.112
BECAUSE THERE'S THIS THIS CHARGE

02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:08.714
OF WATER INTO THE SYSTEM.

02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:10.282
THAT DOESN'T MEET THOSE THE

02:13:10.349 --> 02:13:12.517
STANDARDS AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO

02:13:12.584 --> 02:13:14.686
EXTRAORDINARY A LIABILITY THAT'S

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:16.088
WHY THEY PUSHED SO HARD FOR THIS

02:13:16.154 --> 02:13:18.657
PARTIAL TAX MEASURE W. IN LOS

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:19.491
ANGELES COUNTY.

02:13:19.558 --> 02:13:21.460
AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IN

02:13:21.526 --> 02:13:23.261
THIS BILL IS WE HAVE.

02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:25.130
GONE TO THE CITIES AND SAID LOOK

02:13:25.197 --> 02:13:25.764
WHEN YOU GET IT WHEN YOU GET IT

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:27.532
A BUSINESS LICENSE YOU JUST GOT.

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:28.433
TO PUT YOUR NUMBER DO YOU HAVE A

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:30.402
PERMIT OR NOT IF YOU DO PUT THE

02:13:30.469 --> 02:13:31.236
NUMBER IN.

02:13:31.303 --> 02:13:32.504
AND THE CITY'S YOU'RE GONNA HEAR

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:34.206
HIM COMPLAIN BECAUSE THAT WE'RE

02:13:34.272 --> 02:13:35.340
REQUIRING THEM TO CHECK IT OUT.

02:13:35.407 --> 02:13:37.075
OKAY WERE REQUIRED TO CHECK IT

02:13:37.142 --> 02:13:38.744
OUT BUT IF WHEN THEY DON'T DO

02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:40.178
WHAT THEY'RE DOING ONE THING

02:13:40.245 --> 02:13:41.146
THEY'RE TREATING THE PEOPLE WHO

02:13:41.213 --> 02:13:42.748
ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW IN A

02:13:42.814 --> 02:13:44.383
HORRIBLE WAY IN THEIR CITIES.

02:13:44.449 --> 02:13:46.385
AND SECONDLY THERE EXPOSING

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:48.520
THEIR TAXPAYERS TO UNBELIEVABLE

02:13:48.587 --> 02:13:51.022
FINES FOR THEIR FAILURE TO DO

02:13:51.089 --> 02:13:52.624
THAT SO YES IS A LITTLE BIT OF

02:13:52.691 --> 02:13:53.892
BURDEN FOR THEM TO GO AND LOOK

02:13:53.959 --> 02:13:55.360
UP ON THE WEBSITE. TO SEE

02:13:55.427 --> 02:13:56.661
WHETHER THESE PEOPLE HAVE A

02:13:56.728 --> 02:13:58.397
PERMIT OR NOT IS THAT SIMPLE

02:13:58.463 --> 02:14:00.432
ENOUGH YEAH DO YOU WANT YOU KNOW

02:14:00.499 --> 02:14:01.333
IT'S LIKE OH GOD IT'S ANOTHER

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:02.634
REQUIREMENT.

02:14:02.701 --> 02:14:04.336
BUT I WOULD SUGGEST ON LIKE

02:14:04.403 --> 02:14:05.971
OTHER AREAS OF THE LAW THAT WE

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:07.038
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH IN MANY

02:14:07.105 --> 02:14:08.607
CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:14:08.673 --> 02:14:10.909
THIS IS AN AREA OF THE LAW WHERE

02:14:10.976 --> 02:14:12.344
THE ASK IS SO SMALL.

02:14:12.411 --> 02:14:13.912
AND THE BENEFIT TO PEOPLE WHO

02:14:13.979 --> 02:14:15.714
ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAWS AND

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:18.283
ALSO THE BENEFIT TO TAXPAYERS IS

02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:19.551
SO HUGE.

02:14:19.618 --> 02:14:21.887
YOU KNOW IN THE MY DAD USED TO

02:14:21.953 --> 02:14:23.221
SAY IN THE OLD DAYS IN LATIN

02:14:23.288 --> 02:14:24.890
DIMINISH NOT CURE AT LEX THE LAW

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:30.128
DOES NOT DEAL WITH TRIFLES AND

02:14:30.195 --> 02:14:31.363
THAT THIS IS OPPOSITION IS A

02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.997
TRIFLE I THINK IT'S A REALLY.

02:14:32.063 --> 02:14:32.664
ELEGANT SOLUTION THAT CAME TO ME

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.699
BY THE SPONSORS AND THAT'S WHY I

02:14:34.766 --> 02:14:38.737
TOOK IT UP AND ASK YOUR RIVAL.

02:14:38.804 --> 02:14:39.805
GO AHEAD.

02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:41.840
AGOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE

02:14:41.907 --> 02:14:42.974
MEMBERS MY NAME SEAN BUFFALO I'M

02:14:43.041 --> 02:14:44.609
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR A

02:14:44.676 --> 02:14:46.144
CALIFORNIA COAST KEY POINTS.

02:14:46.211 --> 02:14:47.012
OF THE SENATOR SAID EVERYTHING

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:48.079
GREAT SO I'M GOING TO MAKE A FEW

02:14:48.146 --> 02:14:49.681
CLARIFICATIONS GIVE A LITTLE

02:14:49.748 --> 02:14:51.183
DETAIL ABOUT HOW THIS BILL

02:14:51.249 --> 02:14:52.617
REALLY DOES HELP MUNICIPALITIES.

02:14:52.684 --> 02:14:53.952
OF AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO

02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:55.754
THE REGULATED COMMUNITY TO GIVE

02:14:55.821 --> 02:14:58.723
THEIR THEIR TESTIMONY -- TWO

02:14:58.790 --> 02:15:00.225
CLARIFICATIONS ONE THERE WAS A

02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:01.726
CONFUSION WHEN THIS BILL WAS

02:15:01.793 --> 02:15:03.428
VERY FIRST INTRODUCED THAT THE

02:15:03.495 --> 02:15:05.564
MUNICIPALITIES WERE REQUIRED TO

02:15:05.630 --> 02:15:06.932
DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE

02:15:06.998 --> 02:15:08.300
ACTUAL PERMIT ITSELF SO THE

02:15:08.366 --> 02:15:10.068
WATER QUALITY STANDARDS WITH IN

02:15:10.135 --> 02:15:10.702
THE PERMIT.

02:15:10.769 --> 02:15:12.304
THE PERMIT TERMS THAT IS NOT THE

02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:14.039
INTENT OF THE BILL THAT'S NOT

02:15:14.105 --> 02:15:14.773
WHAT THE BILL SAYS TO DO.

02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:16.174
THE THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO

02:15:16.241 --> 02:15:18.310
SIMPLY INSURE THAT THE

02:15:18.376 --> 02:15:19.277
INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THAT ARE

02:15:19.344 --> 02:15:20.779
SEEKING A BUSINESS LICENSE ARE

02:15:20.846 --> 02:15:22.647
IN ROLLED UNDER THE PERMIT

02:15:22.714 --> 02:15:23.281
THAT'S IT.

02:15:23.348 --> 02:15:25.016
AND AS THE SENATOR SAID ALL THAT

02:15:25.083 --> 02:15:26.184
ENTAILS IN THE WAY WE DESCRIBED

02:15:26.251 --> 02:15:27.619
TO BE TAKEN SEVERAL AMENDMENTS

02:15:27.686 --> 02:15:29.287
TO A CLARIFY BUT BE ALSO

02:15:29.354 --> 02:15:31.089
STREAMLINED THE PROCESS.

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:32.724
IS TO TAKE A FOUR DIGIT AS I SEE

02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:33.592
CODE THAT I WON THOSE THAT'S ON

02:15:33.658 --> 02:15:36.127
THE APPLICATION AND COMPARE IT --

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:37.395
TO THE STATE WATER BOARDS WEBS

02:15:37.462 --> 02:15:38.930
WEB PAGE THAT THEY ACTUALLY

02:15:38.997 --> 02:15:40.765
CREATED JUST FOR THIS BILL -- SO

02:15:40.832 --> 02:15:42.234
THAT'S THAT'S THE INTENT OF IT

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:44.536
SECOND -- UNDER MUNICIPAL STORM

02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:45.470
WATER PERMITS TO NOT THE

02:15:45.537 --> 02:15:47.138
INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT BUT

02:15:47.205 --> 02:15:48.440
THE MUNICIPAL ONE THAT -- CITIES

02:15:48.507 --> 02:15:49.274
AND COUNTIES ARE UNDER THEIR

02:15:49.341 --> 02:15:51.710
ALREADY OBLIGATED TO DO THIS IS

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:52.878
ACTUALLY NOT AS PRESCRIPTIVE IS

02:15:52.944 --> 02:15:54.312
THROUGH THE BUSINESS LICENSE

02:15:54.379 --> 02:15:55.080
EVEN THOUGH THAT'S GIVEN AS AN

02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:57.983
EXAMPLE -- BUT THEY ARE REQUIRED

02:15:58.049 --> 02:15:59.784
TO IDENTIFY AND INSPECT

02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:01.486
INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES IN THEIR

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:03.522
THEIR REGION BECAUSE THOSE

02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:04.789
INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES ARE

02:16:04.856 --> 02:16:06.258
LEADING TO THEIR WATER QUALITY

02:16:06.324 --> 02:16:07.359
IMPAIRMENTS.

02:16:07.425 --> 02:16:08.627
SO LASTLY HOW DOES THIS HELP

02:16:08.693 --> 02:16:10.128
MUNICIPALITIES CITIES AND

02:16:10.195 --> 02:16:11.429
COUNTIES SO THE SENATOR SAID

02:16:11.496 --> 02:16:12.464
WELL I'M GONNA GET JUST AN

02:16:12.531 --> 02:16:15.267
EXAMPLE I TAKE THE LA RIVER --

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:16.668
IS IMPAIRED FOR NUMEROUS THINGS

02:16:16.735 --> 02:16:18.403
SO -- ELLIE METALS LET'S JUST

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:19.771
USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE PUTTING

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:20.705
TOO MUCH MALES INTO THE RIVER

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:22.040
BECAUSE THE RIVER TO BE TOXIC SO

02:16:22.107 --> 02:16:23.308
WITH THEREGIONAL BOARD DOES

02:16:23.375 --> 02:16:24.643
WHEN THEY DETERMINE THAT IT IS

02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:26.211
TO TOXIC IS THEY THEY DETERMINE

02:16:26.278 --> 02:16:26.978
HOW MUCH.

02:16:27.045 --> 02:16:30.015
OF METALS THE RIVER CAN --

02:16:30.081 --> 02:16:31.750
ASSEMBLY HOW MUCH CAN THEY TAKE

02:16:31.816 --> 02:16:39.424
WITH THE CAPACITY THE DIVIDED

02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:40.058
AMONG ALL THE PERMIT TO USE THAT

02:16:40.125 --> 02:16:42.761
OUR DISK AGING IN THE ARE OF

02:16:42.827 --> 02:16:43.895
METALS INTO THE RIVER.

02:16:43.962 --> 02:16:45.764
WELL WE'RE FINDING THAT A IT

02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:47.432
IT'S UP TO FOUR OUT OF FIVE

02:16:47.499 --> 02:16:48.266
INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES ARE NOT

02:16:48.333 --> 02:16:49.200
UNDER THIS INDUSTRIAL PERMITS.

02:16:49.267 --> 02:16:49.801
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT

02:16:49.868 --> 02:16:50.769
WAY 80% OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE

02:16:50.835 --> 02:16:51.336
DISCHARGING METALS INTO THE

02:16:51.403 --> 02:16:52.203
RIVER DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT

02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:53.238
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE AND

02:16:53.305 --> 02:16:54.773
ARE NOT UNDER THE PERMIT.

02:16:54.839 --> 02:16:55.407
THAN THOSE MUNICIPALITIES THAT

02:16:55.473 --> 02:16:57.475
ARE PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:16:57.542 --> 02:16:59.110
TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH

02:16:59.177 --> 02:17:00.812
THEIR CHAIR THE PIE THAT

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:01.780
LIABILITY DOESN'T GO AWAY UNTIL

02:17:01.846 --> 02:17:03.081
THE TEAM DEAL WITH THE THE

02:17:03.148 --> 02:17:03.915
IMPAIRMENT IS GONE.

02:17:03.982 --> 02:17:05.684
BUT 80% OF PEOPLE ARE STILL THIS

02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:07.319
CHARGING THAT THE IMPAIRMENTS

02:17:07.385 --> 02:17:08.853
NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY SO THIS

02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:11.389
DOES HELP MUNICIPALITIES --

02:17:11.456 --> 02:17:16.094
LIABILITY AND WITH THAT I ASK

02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:16.861

WORRY REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL AND

02:23:40.011 --> 02:23:41.612
STATE LAW TO DO IT WE'RE JUST

02:23:41.679 --> 02:23:43.948
PROVIDING A PROCESS TO GET THERE.

02:23:44.015 --> 02:23:46.084
AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT BUT I'VE

02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:47.652
FOUND IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR THE

02:23:47.719 --> 02:23:49.253
DAYS OF WORK OF FOUR YEARS OF

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.888
WORKING ON A LIVE CALL LAWS AND

02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:51.823
ALL THE VARIOUS ASPECTS AND

02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:52.857
LOCAL GOVERNMENT INSURING THE

02:23:52.924 --> 02:23:53.825
SENATE COMMITTEE.

02:23:53.891 --> 02:23:55.727
OVERSEEING THIS IS THESE ARE THE

02:23:55.793 --> 02:23:57.595
STANDARD KINDS OF OBJECTIONS

02:23:57.662 --> 02:23:58.162
THAT YOU GET.

02:23:58.229 --> 02:23:59.864
AND ARE TO ME THIS ONE SURPRISES

02:23:59.931 --> 02:24:01.332
ME QUITE FRANKLY IN MY

02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:03.134
EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE

02:24:03.201 --> 02:24:04.535
DOING THE MATURE GAINING FAVOR

02:24:04.602 --> 02:24:07.171
BY VIRTUE OF HELPING.

02:24:07.238 --> 02:24:08.940
LEGITIMATE BUSINESS IS YOUR IN

02:24:09.007 --> 02:24:10.241
YOUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:11.409
COMPLYING.

02:24:11.476 --> 02:24:12.910
AND SAYING WE'RE JUST LIKE WITH

02:24:12.977 --> 02:24:14.579
THE TESTIMONY WAS WE'RE GOING TO

02:24:14.645 --> 02:24:15.646
MAKE SURE THAT THE NON

02:24:15.713 --> 02:24:17.482
COMPLIANCE ARE CAUGHT.

02:24:17.548 --> 02:24:19.250
AND TO WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE

02:24:19.317 --> 02:24:21.219
THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE PROTECTED

02:24:21.285 --> 02:24:23.421
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TAXPAYERS

02:24:23.488 --> 02:24:24.756
ARE GOING TO GET SUBJECT TO HUGE

02:24:24.822 --> 02:24:25.456
FINES.

02:24:25.523 --> 02:24:26.591
IF THESE LOCAL CITIES ARE

02:24:26.657 --> 02:24:28.393
POLLUTING AND ALL WE'RE DOING IS

02:24:28.459 --> 02:24:29.927
FINDING AN ELEGANT MECHANISM IN

02:24:29.994 --> 02:24:32.030
MY JUDGMENT THAT REQUIRES THEM

02:24:32.096 --> 02:24:34.265
TO HAVE A A LINE ITEM ON A FORM.

02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:35.600
IT HAS TO BE FILLED OUT AND THEN

02:24:35.666 --> 02:24:37.068
THEY GO TO THE COMPUTER THEY HIT

02:24:37.135 --> 02:24:38.536
THE BUTTON ON THE WEBSITE AND

02:24:38.603 --> 02:24:39.604
THEY LOOK AT IT.

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:40.271
AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S NEEDED TO

02:24:40.338 --> 02:24:42.173
BE DONE AND THAT WILL GO A LONG

02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:44.075
WAY IN MAKING SURE THE LOS

02:24:44.142 --> 02:24:44.942
COMPLIED WITH.

02:24:45.009 --> 02:24:45.743
AND THAT BUSINESSES ARE

02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:46.978
PROTECTED AND TAXPAYERS ARE

02:24:47.045 --> 02:24:49.047
PROTECTED THAT'S THE REASON WHY

02:24:49.113 --> 02:24:50.348
I FIND THIS ONE KIND OF ODD BUT

02:24:50.415 --> 02:24:53.317
OKAY NEW TO ME SO THEN IF IT'S

02:24:53.384 --> 02:24:55.653
SOMETHING OUT THROUGH THE CHAIR

02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:56.254
I GUESS.

02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:57.688
NO NO ABSOLUTE AT THE HEAD IF

02:24:57.755 --> 02:24:58.956
IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

02:24:59.023 --> 02:25:01.159
ESSENTIALLY A FAVOR TO THE

02:25:01.225 --> 02:25:03.561
CITY'S -- WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

02:25:03.628 --> 02:25:05.329
THE CITIES THEN WHY HAVEN'T THE

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:07.365
CITY'S IMPLEMENTED THIS ON THEIR

02:25:07.432 --> 02:25:08.699
OWN SOME HAVE.

02:25:08.766 --> 02:25:09.801
SOME ALREADY HAVE SOME HAVE SOME

02:25:09.867 --> 02:25:11.602
HAVE IN THIS IS BASICALLY TO

02:25:11.669 --> 02:25:13.004
MAKE SURE THAT.

02:25:13.071 --> 02:25:15.239
A AND I IT'S QUITE FRANKLY I I

02:25:15.306 --> 02:25:17.308
THINK HONESTLY MY OWN PERSONAL

02:25:17.375 --> 02:25:18.776
OPINION IS SOME JIM THOUGHT OF

02:25:18.843 --> 02:25:19.844
IT AT SOME POINT BUT WE KNOW

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:20.978
THAT SOME HAVE.

02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:21.979
AND ARE DOING THIS STUFF THIS

02:25:22.046 --> 02:25:24.348
JUST REQUIRES ACROSS THE STATE

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:26.117
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:25:26.184 --> 02:25:28.152
OF BOTH I THOUGHT THE ELEGANT

02:25:28.219 --> 02:25:29.454
COMMENT THAT WAS MADE I THINK IS%

02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:31.022
MISTER FLANAGAN MADE ABOUT BOTH

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:32.390
THE REGULATORY SIDE IN THE

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:33.791
ENVIRONMENTAL CITED HOW UNIQUE

02:25:33.858 --> 02:25:41.499
THAT IS AND THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT

02:25:41.566 --> 02:25:41.999
THIS IS A PRETTY ELEGANT

02:25:42.066 --> 02:25:44.135
SOLUTION.

02:25:44.202 --> 02:25:45.536
OKAY SO THEN AS IT JUST A FINAL

02:25:45.603 --> 02:25:46.637
THOUGHT -- THE REQUIREMENT WOULD

02:25:46.704 --> 02:25:47.705
NOT COME WITH ANY FUNDS

02:25:47.772 --> 02:25:48.306
FOLLOWING THAT TO HELP CITIES

02:25:48.372 --> 02:25:48.940
IMPLEMENT THIS I KNOW YOU SAID

02:25:49.006 --> 02:25:49.474
THAT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.608
LOOKING ON THE WEBSITE AND ALL

02:25:50.675 --> 02:25:51.976
THAT BUT AS YOU KNOW CITIES.

02:25:52.043 --> 02:25:53.411
ON THEIR BUDGETS ARE SHRINKING

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:54.579
AND THEY HAVE THEIR MORE AND

02:25:54.645 --> 02:25:55.880
MORE STRAIN WITH WHAT THEY HAVE

02:25:55.947 --> 02:25:57.748
TO PAY FOR SO IT IS ADDITIONAL

02:25:57.815 --> 02:25:59.150
RESOURCES THEY WOULD MEAN VERY

02:25:59.217 --> 02:26:00.051
LIKELY.

02:26:00.118 --> 02:26:01.819
THEY WOULD CHOOSE TO RAISE THE

02:26:01.886 --> 02:26:03.187
COST OF CERTAIN FEES FOR

02:26:03.254 --> 02:26:05.823
PERMITTING IN THEIR CITY.

02:26:05.890 --> 02:26:07.225
TO COVER THE COST ASSOCIATED

02:26:07.291 --> 02:26:08.659
WITH DOING THIS SO IS THERE ANY

02:26:08.726 --> 02:26:10.361
STATE FUNDING THAT WILL FOLLOW

02:26:10.428 --> 02:26:13.030
THIS TYPE OF REGULATION OR I

02:26:13.097 --> 02:26:15.867
GUESS -- YOU KNOW IMPOSING THIS

02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.602
TYPE A BURDEN ON CITIES.

02:26:17.668 --> 02:26:18.603
WHAT A BOOK I I I JUST THE

02:26:18.669 --> 02:26:20.204
ANSWER THE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY

02:26:20.271 --> 02:26:22.507
TO BE DIRECTORS NOW OKAY BUT?

02:26:22.573 --> 02:26:24.375
THE THE AYE AYE I JUST ARE THE

02:26:24.442 --> 02:26:25.877
ONLY I DISAGREE IS THIS IS NOT A

02:26:25.943 --> 02:26:27.545
BURDEN IT'S A HELP THAT THEY

02:26:27.612 --> 02:26:28.679

THEIR BUSINESSES AND TO HELP

02:26:30.014 --> 02:26:31.849
THEIR TAXPAYERS.

02:26:31.916 --> 02:26:32.817
AND IN FACT IT'S THAT IT'S A

02:26:32.884 --> 02:26:35.419
CHEAP INEXPENSIVE WAY TO AVOID

02:26:35.486 --> 02:26:37.388
LIABILITY AND IT'S A PRETTY

02:26:37.455 --> 02:26:39.557
NIFTY WAY I THINK -- THAT WAS

02:26:39.624 --> 02:26:40.691
THAT WAS BROUGHT TO ME AND

02:26:40.758 --> 02:26:42.326
THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING IT BUT

02:26:42.393 --> 02:26:43.928

02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:03.614
APPARENTLY SOME CITIES DON'T

ISSUE BUSINESS PERMITS I HEARD

02:27:05.883 --> 02:27:07.251

02:40:40.831 --> 02:40:42.099
YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN WHEN.

02:40:42.165 --> 02:40:43.767
THE THE THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR AND

02:40:43.834 --> 02:40:45.068
AND AND ONE OTHER OTHER

02:40:45.135 --> 02:40:47.738
COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED STANDARDS --

02:40:47.804 --> 02:40:50.307
THAT THAT WE WE WE YOU KNOW MAKE

02:40:50.374 --> 02:40:54.111
THE ARGUMENT -- TO TO BANNED

02:40:54.177 --> 02:40:55.879
CERTAIN CHEMICALS FROM CONSUMER

02:40:55.946 --> 02:40:57.881
PRODUCTS THAT OFTEN THE THE

02:40:57.948 --> 02:40:59.249
RESPONSE AS WELL WE HAVE THE

02:40:59.316 --> 02:41:01.284
GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM AND AND

02:41:01.351 --> 02:41:03.687
THAT -- AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT

02:41:03.754 --> 02:41:04.521
BE.

02:41:04.588 --> 02:41:06.523
TAKEN APPROACH OF OF OF BANNING

02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:07.624
WHEN THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR IN

02:41:07.691 --> 02:41:09.092
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING THIS

02:41:09.159 --> 02:41:10.594
BECAUSE WE SHOULD FALL THE GREEN

02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:11.962
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM.

02:41:12.029 --> 02:41:13.897
CONSUMERS ARE ADDRESS MY CONCERN

02:41:13.964 --> 02:41:15.766
THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE

02:41:15.832 --> 02:41:17.000
THAT REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION ARE

02:41:17.067 --> 02:41:18.969
NOW NEUTRAL ARE GONNA BE COMING

02:41:19.036 --> 02:41:21.304
BACK -- TO MY BILL NEXT YEAR

02:41:21.371 --> 02:41:24.107
SAYING WELL WE HAVE THE GREEN

02:41:24.174 --> 02:41:24.808
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM.

02:41:24.875 --> 02:41:26.309
YEAH I THINK THE PROBLEM IS AND

02:41:26.376 --> 02:41:27.210
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THIS

02:41:27.277 --> 02:41:28.545
COMMITTEE WORK -- WITH OUR

02:41:28.612 --> 02:41:30.047
COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE SIDE TO

02:41:30.113 --> 02:41:31.415
PRESENT THE FINDINGS OF THE

02:41:31.481 --> 02:41:32.949
SCREEN CHEMISTRY AT TEN YEARS

02:41:33.016 --> 02:41:34.551
REPORT THAT I'M I KNOW THAT MANY

02:41:34.618 --> 02:41:35.952
OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND THE

02:41:36.019 --> 02:41:38.989
FACT IS IS THAT -- IN TEN YEARS

02:41:39.056 --> 02:41:41.324
NOT A SINGLE CHEMICAL HAS HAD AN

02:41:41.391 --> 02:41:42.325
ALTERNATE ANALYSIS COMPLETED

02:41:42.392 --> 02:41:43.126
UNDER THE CIVIL CONSUMER

02:41:43.193 --> 02:41:44.528
PRODUCTS PROGRAM NOT.

02:41:44.594 --> 02:41:46.963
A SINGLE REGULATION HAS RESULTED.

02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:49.533
AND SO.

02:41:49.599 --> 02:41:50.967
WE DID HAVE THE PROGRAM ON PAPER

02:41:51.034 --> 02:41:53.770
NOW WE WANT TO GIVE IT SOME.

02:41:53.837 --> 02:41:55.138
RETURNING A REALITY TO BELIEVE

02:41:55.205 --> 02:41:56.540
SOMETHING THAT THAT IS THAT THAT

02:41:56.606 --> 02:41:58.241
THAT MEETS THE GOALS OF WHAT WAS

02:41:58.308 --> 02:42:00.310
IT ORIGINALLY PUT FORWARD -- YOU

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:02.045
KNOW PART OF WHAT THE BILL DOES

02:42:02.112 --> 02:42:04.848
IS IS IS MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

02:42:04.915 --> 02:42:06.750
WE CAN -- USE AVAILABLE

02:42:06.817 --> 02:42:08.485
INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE --

02:42:08.552 --> 02:42:09.453
WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:42:09.519 --> 02:42:10.854
HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT WAS

02:42:10.921 --> 02:42:12.189
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:42:12.255 --> 02:42:13.590
RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IN THAT

02:42:13.657 --> 02:42:14.424
THE KIND OF THE CALIBER OF THE

02:42:14.491 --> 02:42:15.592
EVIDENCE.

02:42:15.659 --> 02:42:17.994
THAT WE MIGHT BE USED -- TO TO

02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:19.963
IMPACT A PARTICULAR CHEMICAL --

02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:22.132
YOU KNOW THERE ALSO WAS WAS WAS

02:42:22.199 --> 02:42:23.233
LANGUAGE THAT WAS TAKEN TO MAKE

02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:24.401
SURE THAT THE DATA CALLING

02:42:24.468 --> 02:42:26.336
AUTHORITY OF THE TNC WOULD BE

02:42:26.403 --> 02:42:26.803
EXERCISED RESPONSIBLY

02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:28.705
TRANSPARENTLY THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:42:28.772 --> 02:42:29.739
BIG ISSUES THAT EXISTED THAT

02:42:29.806 --> 02:42:29.940
THAT.

02:42:30.006 --> 02:42:31.842
WE WE THE OF OUR DEPARTMENT DID

02:42:31.908 --> 02:42:33.643
NOT HAVE ENOUGH AUTHORITY UNDER

02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:35.312
THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM TO GET THE

02:42:35.378 --> 02:42:36.446
SORT OF INFORMATION THAT NEED

02:42:36.513 --> 02:42:38.014
THE DATA NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO

02:42:38.081 --> 02:42:39.816
MAKE WISE DECISIONS AND SO.

02:42:39.883 --> 02:42:41.051
I THINK WHAT THE OPPOSITION

02:42:41.118 --> 02:42:44.721
WANTED WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT --

02:42:44.788 --> 02:42:47.424
THAT THE YEAH THE THE THE THE

02:42:47.491 --> 02:42:48.325
THAT THAT THAT THAT AUTHORITY

02:42:48.391 --> 02:42:49.326
WOULD BE EXERCISED IN A IN A

02:42:49.392 --> 02:42:51.328
RESPONSIBLE TRANSPARENT WAY --

02:42:51.394 --> 02:42:54.264
BUT BUT BUT ANY OF THE DAY

02:42:54.331 --> 02:42:54.564
[inaudible]

02:42:54.631 --> 02:42:57.501
I WE WILL.

02:42:57.567 --> 02:42:58.902
IF IF IF THERE IS A LEGITIMATE

02:42:58.969 --> 02:43:01.404
REASON TO TO BAN A CHEMICAL AND

02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:02.772
AND THAT IS OUT THERE IN THE

02:43:02.839 --> 02:43:04.007
YEAH AND THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S

02:43:04.074 --> 02:43:08.311
AMPLE EVIDENCE -- IT WILL BE A

02:43:08.378 --> 02:43:10.046
IF IF IF IF THE IF THE IF THE IF

02:43:10.113 --> 02:43:11.348
THE EVIDENCE IS THERE.

02:43:11.414 --> 02:43:14.017
IT WILL GET WILL GET ADDRESS AND

02:43:14.084 --> 02:43:14.985
IN THIS PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW AND

02:43:15.051 --> 02:43:16.620
LET LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION IF

02:43:16.686 --> 02:43:17.754
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A

02:43:17.821 --> 02:43:19.523
PARTICULAR CHEMICAL THAT YOU

02:43:19.589 --> 02:43:20.557
KNOW THAT THE YOU REALLY

02:43:20.624 --> 02:43:21.324
CONCERNED ABOUT -- BUT IN THE

02:43:21.391 --> 02:43:23.026
END OF THE DAY THIS IS GOING TO

02:43:23.093 --> 02:43:25.061
ENSURE THAT -- THAT THAT ARE

02:43:25.128 --> 02:43:26.396
REGULARS WILL HAVE THE BOTH THE

02:43:26.463 --> 02:43:28.565
THE DATA COLLECTION INFORMATION

02:43:28.632 --> 02:43:29.432
THAT THEY NEED AND ALSO THE

02:43:29.499 --> 02:43:32.435
TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. TO BE ABLE

02:43:32.502 --> 02:43:34.204
TO TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC -- BUT

02:43:34.271 --> 02:43:37.707
BUT DO SO IN A WAY I I THINK

02:43:37.774 --> 02:43:38.942
THAT THAT THAT MET SOME OF THE

02:43:39.009 --> 02:43:40.343
THE RIGOROUS STANDARDS IN SOME

02:43:40.410 --> 02:43:41.811
OF THE DUE PROCESS STANDARDS

02:43:41.878 --> 02:43:42.679
THAT ARE.

02:43:42.746 --> 02:43:43.346
THE FOLKS INDUSTRY WERE

02:43:43.413 --> 02:43:44.848
CONCERNED ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO

02:43:44.915 --> 02:43:45.815
HOW THE BILL WAS ORIGINALLY

02:43:45.882 --> 02:43:46.950
WRITTEN.

02:43:47.017 --> 02:43:48.285
YEAH THE CENTER AYE AYE.

02:43:48.351 --> 02:43:49.486
AYE SIR TO START OFF BY SAYING

02:43:49.553 --> 02:43:51.221
THAT I WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT

02:43:51.288 --> 02:43:53.456
OF YOUR BILL AND THE OTHER YOU

02:43:53.523 --> 02:43:55.258
KNOW -- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT.

02:43:55.325 --> 02:43:58.628
THAT DAD THIS IS A A WORTHWHILE

02:43:58.695 --> 02:44:00.830
EFFORT BUT I'M I'M JUST

02:44:00.897 --> 02:44:03.099
REFERRING A TO A THIS COMMITTEES

02:44:03.166 --> 02:44:05.368
ANALYSIS ON YOUR COLLEAGUES --

02:44:05.435 --> 02:44:06.570
THE TALKING YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T

02:44:06.636 --> 02:44:08.238
READ THIS BUT ON ON SERRA

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:09.973
CABALLERO IS BILL EARLIER

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:10.941
THERE'S A PASSAGE IN HEARING

02:44:11.007 --> 02:44:11.541
GETTING.

02:44:11.608 --> 02:44:13.143
THAT IT IS LONG BEING RECOGNIZE

02:44:13.210 --> 02:44:15.445
THAT THE TSC DOES NOT HAVE THE

02:44:15.512 --> 02:44:17.147
RESOURCE OKAY -- TO THE THIS IS

02:44:17.214 --> 02:44:23.286
FOR SB THREE SEVENTEEN ON PAGE

02:44:23.353 --> 02:44:24.821
FIVE YEAH.

02:44:24.888 --> 02:44:25.722
YOU KNOW IT IS JUST MAKING THE

02:44:25.789 --> 02:44:26.523
POINT THAT.

02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:27.924
TO NOT ONLY DOES THE S. C. P.

02:44:27.991 --> 02:44:28.758
THAT THE SAFE CONSUMER.

02:44:28.825 --> 02:44:29.960
PRODUCTS PROGRAM LACK A

02:44:30.026 --> 02:44:31.494
DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE THE FUN

02:44:31.561 --> 02:44:32.095
DTS HE'S WORKED WITH DTS USE

02:44:32.162 --> 02:44:33.496
CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER A

02:44:33.563 --> 02:44:35.532
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT LEAVING FOR

02:44:35.599 --> 02:44:37.767
THE CONSTRAINED RESOURCES -- DTC

02:44:37.834 --> 02:44:39.402
HAS HAD HISTORIC HIT CHALLENGES

02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:41.471
DO SIR DID RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS

02:44:41.538 --> 02:44:45.141
AND SO I KNOW YOUR BILL CALLS --

02:44:45.208 --> 02:44:47.043
FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING BUT I I

02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:50.280
JUST WITH A AGAIN I I JUST WANNA

02:44:50.347 --> 02:44:53.083
MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT -- THIS

02:44:53.149 --> 02:44:54.584
PROGRAM IS NOT USE I SHARE THAT

02:44:54.651 --> 02:44:56.920
CONCERN LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON

02:44:56.987 --> 02:44:59.556
ON SOME BUDGET -- PLAY FOR IN

02:44:59.623 --> 02:45:00.757
THAT DIRECTION I KNOW THE MY

02:45:00.824 --> 02:45:02.392
WITNESSES WANTED TO RESPOND TO

02:45:02.459 --> 02:45:04.261
THIS IS WELL IF IF THROUGH THE

02:45:04.327 --> 02:45:06.496
CHAIR IF IF AT ALL -- OKAY BUT

02:45:06.563 --> 02:45:08.832
BRIEFLY.

02:45:08.898 --> 02:45:10.133
IT IS VERY LONG DAY I JUST REYES

02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:11.568
YES IT HAS.

02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:13.169
I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW YOU

02:45:13.236 --> 02:45:15.071
WERE ELECTED OFFICIALS IF THERE

02:45:15.138 --> 02:45:16.906
IS VERY STRONG EVIDENCE ABOUT

02:45:16.973 --> 02:45:18.742
SOMETHING AND IT'S VERY EVIDENT

02:45:18.808 --> 02:45:20.143
FROM ANOTHER GOVERNMENT OR

02:45:20.210 --> 02:45:22.112
WHATEVER AND AND THE LEGISLATURE

02:45:22.178 --> 02:45:23.813
CHOOSES TO ACT.

02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:25.115
THE BILL WHEN IT WAS FIRST

02:45:25.181 --> 02:45:26.983
CONCEIVED NEVER TOOK THAT AWAY

02:45:27.050 --> 02:45:28.451
FROM YOU.

02:45:28.518 --> 02:45:30.186
ARE AND SO.

02:45:30.253 --> 02:45:30.854
YOU WILL -- YOU KNOW YOU WOULD

02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:32.656
ALWAYS HAVE THAT OPTION AS A

02:45:32.722 --> 02:45:34.491
LEGISLATIVE BODY THIS IS OF

02:45:34.557 --> 02:45:36.359
COURSE AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM

02:45:36.426 --> 02:45:39.062
BECAUSE THOSE THOSE SOLUTIONS OF

02:45:39.129 --> 02:45:40.563
WHAT TO DO ABOUT TOXIC CHEMICALS

02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:42.098
ARE NOT ALWAYS EVIDENT.

02:45:42.165 --> 02:45:43.433
AND THIS CAMERA THIS PROGRAM

02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:45.001
PROVIDES THE SCIENTIFIC

02:45:45.068 --> 02:45:47.337
BACKGROUND TO AVOID REGRETTABLE

02:45:47.404 --> 02:45:49.239
SUBSTITUTIONS AND MAKE SURE

02:45:49.306 --> 02:45:51.041
WE'RE GOING FORWARD IN A IN A

02:45:51.107 --> 02:45:52.242
SAFE.

02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:53.777
AND REASONABLE WAY SO I THAT I

02:45:53.843 --> 02:45:56.079
THINK THAT'S THE RESPONSE THAT I

02:45:56.146 --> 02:45:56.680
WOULD.

02:45:56.746 --> 02:45:58.381
PROVIDE TO THAT QUESTION AND I

02:45:58.448 --> 02:46:00.617
WOULD AGREE A 100% AND I THINK

02:46:00.684 --> 02:46:05.055
THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT.

02:46:05.121 --> 02:46:05.622
IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:07.190
THAT WE HAVE A FULL PROCESS IN

02:46:07.257 --> 02:46:09.192
MANY CASES NOW JUST BANNING LEAD

02:46:09.259 --> 02:46:11.728
IN JEWELRY WHICH WE JUST DID.

02:46:11.795 --> 02:46:13.663
THAT WAS EASY.

02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:14.931
AND WE DIDN'T NEED TO GO TO

02:46:14.998 --> 02:46:16.466
GREEN CHEMISTRY RENO LEADS A

02:46:16.533 --> 02:46:17.500
PROBLEM AND THERE'S NO REASON TO

02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:18.768
HAVE A JEWELRY AND THERE'S NOT

02:46:18.835 --> 02:46:20.570
GOING TO BE A SUBSTITUTE.

02:46:20.637 --> 02:46:22.472
CABINET WE ALSO DID THE SAME --

02:46:22.539 --> 02:46:23.673
IN DAHLE NOT BANNING LEAD BUT

02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:25.208
MAKING IT A VERY SMALL AMONT

02:46:25.275 --> 02:46:26.543
THE SAME FOR CADMIUM.

02:46:26.609 --> 02:46:28.311
AND AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT

02:46:28.378 --> 02:46:29.779
WHEN THERE'S A CONSENSUS AND

02:46:29.846 --> 02:46:31.147
WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A

02:46:31.214 --> 02:46:32.649
VIABLE.

02:46:32.716 --> 02:46:34.851
ALTERNATIVE -- BUT THIS IS KIND

02:46:34.918 --> 02:46:37.120
OF BEYOND THE CURRENT SCOPE OF

02:46:37.187 --> 02:46:38.188
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

02:46:38.254 --> 02:46:40.056
ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS AND

02:46:40.123 --> 02:46:41.691
COMMENTS GO AHEAD MADAM VICE

02:46:41.758 --> 02:46:43.059
CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

02:46:43.126 --> 02:46:46.129
MISTER ALLEN SO.

02:46:46.196 --> 02:46:48.565
OKAY -- THE GREEN INITIATIVE.

02:46:48.631 --> 02:46:49.632
PROGRAM.

02:46:49.699 --> 02:46:51.768
HAS BEYOND HOW MANY CHEMICALS

02:46:51.835 --> 02:46:53.737
SINCE IT CAME INTO EXISTENCE NOT

02:46:53.803 --> 02:46:55.605
A SINGLE ONE NOT YEAH OKAY AND

02:46:55.672 --> 02:46:56.873
THEY'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR

02:46:56.940 --> 02:46:58.408
LIKE TEN YEARS RIGHT.

02:46:58.475 --> 02:47:00.410
OKAY SO HERE'S WHAT I'M

02:47:00.477 --> 02:47:05.315
STRUGGLING WITH WHY.

02:47:05.382 --> 02:47:07.517
YOU HAVE WRITTEN IN THIS BILL.

02:47:07.584 --> 02:47:09.486
FINDS PRETTY.

02:47:09.552 --> 02:47:11.721
PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL FINES SEVENTY

02:47:11.788 --> 02:47:13.957
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION

02:47:14.023 --> 02:47:16.292
OR PER DAY.

02:47:16.359 --> 02:47:18.695
WHICH ALLOWED HE TSC TO IMPOSE

02:47:18.762 --> 02:47:20.463
IF THEY REQUESTED CHEMICAL

02:47:20.530 --> 02:47:21.765
INGREDIENT PRODUCT INFORMATION

02:47:21.831 --> 02:47:23.867
IS NOT PROVIDED SEVENTY THOUSAND

02:47:23.933 --> 02:47:25.602
DOLLARS TODAY.

02:47:25.668 --> 02:47:27.937
BUT THERE IS NO.

02:47:28.004 --> 02:47:29.806
SIMILAR BURDENSOME IMPOSITION

02:47:29.873 --> 02:47:32.542
PLACED ON DTS SEE FOR NOT.

02:47:32.609 --> 02:47:35.478
DOING THEIR JOB WHICH IS I MEAN.

02:47:35.545 --> 02:47:37.380
SO DID YOU SEE HAS COME UP --

02:47:37.447 --> 02:47:38.515
THE GREEN INITIATIVE IS COME UP

02:47:38.581 --> 02:47:41.017
WITH GREEN CHEMISTRY SORRY HAS

02:47:41.084 --> 02:47:42.485
COME UP WITH THIS LIST.

02:47:42.552 --> 02:47:44.254
SO FAR THAT'S ALL I KNOW THAT

02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:45.789
THEY'VE DONE OF CHEMICAL SAID

02:47:45.855 --> 02:47:47.590
YOU KNOW CAN BE AN ISSUE AND

02:47:47.657 --> 02:47:48.958
THEY'VE GONE NO NO FURTHER THAN

02:47:49.025 --> 02:47:50.126
THAT.

02:47:50.193 --> 02:47:51.528
SO I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO

02:47:51.594 --> 02:47:54.531
UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE EVEN.

02:47:54.597 --> 02:47:57.434
PERPETUATING THE EXISTENCE OF

02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:58.968
THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM BECAUSE

02:47:59.035 --> 02:48:00.670
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE DOING

02:48:00.737 --> 02:48:03.540
ANYTHING WITH THAT SAID SO SO.

02:48:03.606 --> 02:48:04.574
WHAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE

02:48:04.641 --> 02:48:05.642
ADDRESSING THE VERY ISSUE THAT

02:48:05.708 --> 02:48:06.276
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT SO SO

02:48:06.342 --> 02:48:08.445
SO THAT VERY QUESTION AS ASKED

02:48:08.511 --> 02:48:10.180
BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE

02:48:10.246 --> 02:48:10.580
THAT?

02:48:10.647 --> 02:48:12.315
PRESENT THIS REPORT WHY IS IT

02:48:12.382 --> 02:48:14.150
THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE.

02:48:14.217 --> 02:48:15.285
TO DO ANYTHING YOU KNOW IS IT

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:16.419
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

02:48:16.486 --> 02:48:18.655
FIND PEOPLE THAT THAT YEAR SORRY

02:48:18.721 --> 02:48:19.556
THAT WAY THE FIGHT BY THE WAY

02:48:19.622 --> 02:48:20.857
THE FINES FOR FOR FOR YOUR

02:48:20.924 --> 02:48:22.025
PERMISSION IT HAS COME DOWN IN

02:48:22.091 --> 02:48:23.893
IT AS PART OF OUR NEGOTIATED.

02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:25.829
A DEAL SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE --

02:48:25.895 --> 02:48:28.198
SEVENTY THOUSAND BUT BUT WHAT

02:48:28.264 --> 02:48:29.933
I'LL SAY IS WHAT THEY FOUND WAS

02:48:29.999 --> 02:48:31.401
THAT THE TEACHERS HE DID NOT

02:48:31.468 --> 02:48:33.203
HAVE ADEQUATE CALL IN FORTY FOR

02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:34.137
TO THE DATA THEY WE WEREN'T

02:48:34.204 --> 02:48:35.138
GETTING THE SORT OF INFORMATION

02:48:35.205 --> 02:48:35.972
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

02:48:36.039 --> 02:48:37.307
GOOD DECISIONS.

02:48:37.373 --> 02:48:38.741
EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY IN

02:48:38.808 --> 02:48:40.443
ADDITION THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO

02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:41.878
ACCESS ALL SORTS OF REALLY GOOD

02:48:41.945 --> 02:48:44.013
PEER REVIEWED INFORMATION OUT IN

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:44.948
THE PUBLIC THEY HAD TO DO THEIR

02:48:45.014 --> 02:48:45.949
OWN.

02:48:46.015 --> 02:48:47.350
INTERNAL NOW SEES UNDER THE

02:48:47.417 --> 02:48:48.651
GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE AS AS

02:48:48.718 --> 02:48:50.086
ORIGINALLY WRITTEN OKAY IF I MAY

02:48:50.153 --> 02:48:51.621
JUST INTERJECT THAT WASN'T THE

02:48:51.688 --> 02:48:53.456
WHOLE POINT OF THE GREEN

02:48:53.523 --> 02:48:54.090
CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE IS THAT YOU

02:48:54.157 --> 02:48:55.058
HAD.

02:48:55.124 --> 02:48:57.560
DETAILS HE HAD AT ITS DISPOSAL

02:48:57.627 --> 02:49:03.199
ITS OWN SCIENTISTS TO TO DO THIS

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:03.766
TYPE OF RESEARCH IS NOT THE

02:49:03.833 --> 02:49:05.134
POINT.

02:49:05.201 --> 02:49:06.135
PART OF PART OF THE POINT I MEAN

02:49:06.202 --> 02:49:06.703
WE DO OKAY BECAUSE THAT THE

02:49:06.769 --> 02:49:07.370
ARGUMENT NOW IS THAT THEY DON'T

02:49:07.437 --> 02:49:09.305
HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION --

02:49:09.372 --> 02:49:10.640
OR THERE IS ENOUGH PEER REVIEWED

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:12.041
INFORMATION THAT THAT IS

02:49:12.108 --> 02:49:13.510
AVAILABLE TO THEM -- NO THERE'S

02:49:13.576 --> 02:49:14.644
TONS OF GOOD PEER REVIEWED

02:49:14.711 --> 02:49:16.279
INFORMATION THE PROBLEM IS THAT

02:49:16.346 --> 02:49:18.448
THE THE THE INITIATIVE -- THE TO

02:49:18.515 --> 02:49:19.849
NOT THEY WEREN'T THEY WEREN'T

02:49:19.916 --> 02:49:21.251
ABLE TO ACCESS THE WAY WILL USE

02:49:21.317 --> 02:49:22.719
IT FOR DECISION MAKING UNDER THE

02:49:22.785 --> 02:49:23.920
OLD STRUCTURE.

02:49:23.987 --> 02:49:25.054
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING UNDER THIS

02:49:25.121 --> 02:49:26.823
STRUCTURE IS ALLOWING THEM TO

02:49:26.890 --> 02:49:28.224
USE HIGH QUALITY CARD REVIEWED

02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:29.459
INFORMATION.

02:49:29.526 --> 02:49:30.660
OKAY THAT'S AND IT'S OUT THERE

02:49:30.727 --> 02:49:32.195
OKAY SO I GET THAT BUT AGAIN

02:49:32.262 --> 02:49:34.397
GOING BACK TO THE WHOLE POINT OF

02:49:34.464 --> 02:49:35.899
PUTTING THIS GROUP TOGETHER IN

02:49:35.965 --> 02:49:37.534
THE FIRST PLACE WAS TO HAVE.

02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:39.936
SCIENTISTS AT OUR DISPOSAL TO DO

02:49:40.003 --> 02:49:43.406
SOME OF THIS WORK WHICH THEY

02:49:43.473 --> 02:49:45.441
HAVE NOT DONE.

02:49:45.508 --> 02:49:46.910
SO I JUST I MEAN THAT'S WHAT

02:49:46.976 --> 02:49:47.744
WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE THEM THE

02:49:47.810 --> 02:49:48.611
TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK

02:49:48.678 --> 02:49:49.245
RIGHT THAT BECAUSE BECAUSE THE

02:49:49.312 --> 02:49:51.114
THE DATE -- THEY THEY DO HAVE A

02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:51.881
SMALL STAFF THEY ARE UNDER

02:49:51.948 --> 02:49:53.616
RESOURCE.

02:49:53.683 --> 02:49:54.984
I THEY'VE GOT LIMITED.

02:49:55.051 --> 02:49:56.986
CAPABILITY BOTH BOTH FROM A FROM

02:49:57.053 --> 02:49:58.388
A FROM A FROM INFRASTRUCTURE

02:49:58.454 --> 02:50:00.189
PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF

02:50:00.256 --> 02:50:01.090
THE WAY THE RULES ARE WRITTEN.

02:50:01.157 --> 02:50:02.659
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS IS

02:50:02.725 --> 02:50:05.028
ALLOWING THEM TO BOTH HAVE MORE

02:50:05.094 --> 02:50:06.930
AUTHORITY TO GET THE INFORMATION

02:50:06.996 --> 02:50:07.697
THEY NEED TO MAKE THE DECISION

02:50:07.764 --> 02:50:08.565
THAT YOU TO MAKE.

02:50:08.631 --> 02:50:10.533
AND BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ACCESS

02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:12.602
AND UTILIZE HIGH QUALITY PEER

02:50:12.669 --> 02:50:14.771
REVIEWED INFORMATION -- THAT

02:50:14.837 --> 02:50:16.306
THAT THAT'S OUT THERE -- IN IN

02:50:16.372 --> 02:50:17.840
THE SCIENCE YOU KNOW IT IT IT IT

02:50:17.907 --> 02:50:18.975
IT'S BEING USED BY OTHER

02:50:19.042 --> 02:50:19.776
REGULATORY AGENCIES AROUND THE

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:21.344
WORLD WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE

02:50:21.411 --> 02:50:23.279
ALLOWED TO USE IT NOW IT WAS THE

02:50:23.346 --> 02:50:25.548
WAY IT WAS STRUCTURED.

02:50:25.615 --> 02:50:26.382
WHEN THE BILL WAS WRITTEN TO TRY

02:50:26.449 --> 02:50:27.817
TO YEAH SO I'VE RIGHT NOW THE

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:29.452
WAY THE PROCESS IS STRUCTURED --

02:50:29.519 --> 02:50:31.921
ONCE A PRODUCT CHEMICAL

02:50:31.988 --> 02:50:34.090
COMBINATION IS IDENTIFIED.

02:50:34.157 --> 02:50:36.926
INDUSTRY -- MANUFACTURERS GET TO

02:50:36.993 --> 02:50:38.027
DO THEIR OWN ANALYSES EACH

02:50:38.094 --> 02:50:40.063
PRODUCT IN THIS SCENARIO WHERE

02:50:40.129 --> 02:50:42.031
AND STUDIES AND EXISTING

02:50:42.098 --> 02:50:43.566
SCIENTISTS STRONG ENOUGH THE

02:50:43.633 --> 02:50:46.269
AGENCY CAN AVOID HAVING TO DO

02:50:46.336 --> 02:50:48.037
INDIVIDUAL AS ALTERNATIVES

02:50:48.104 --> 02:50:49.238
ANALYSES PROPHECIES.

02:50:49.305 --> 02:50:52.241
AND INSTEAD ENGAGE IN A ONE STEP

02:50:52.308 --> 02:50:52.809
ALTERNATES ANALYSIS PROCESS

02:50:52.875 --> 02:50:54.978
PROCESS CONDUCTED BY AGENCY

02:50:55.044 --> 02:50:56.412
SCIENTISTS GET NOTICE AND

02:50:56.479 --> 02:50:57.113
COMMENT.

02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:03.720
AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE AMOUNT

02:51:03.786 --> 02:51:08.524
OF TIME SPENT IN THE PROCESS

02:51:08.591 --> 02:51:08.825
[inaudible]

02:51:08.891 --> 02:51:13.096
PLEASE [inaudible]

02:51:13.162 --> 02:51:16.366
OKAY.

02:51:16.432 --> 02:51:19.135
OKAY SO -- IT ALLOWS THEM TO

02:51:19.202 --> 02:51:19.736
REALIGN PEER REVIEWED SCIENCE

02:51:19.802 --> 02:51:21.004
OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR CREDIBLE

02:51:21.070 --> 02:51:21.971
INSTITUTIONS IS THAT.

02:51:22.038 --> 02:51:24.040
THE LANGUAGE -- OUTLINED

02:51:24.107 --> 02:51:24.974
ACTUALLY -- THE STAIN JING.

02:51:25.041 --> 02:51:26.209
TALKING TO MY I'M SORRY MY

02:51:26.275 --> 02:51:27.477
APOLOGIES -- YES THE LANGUAGE IS

02:51:27.543 --> 02:51:28.344
CHANGING THOUGH THE LANGUAGE

02:51:28.411 --> 02:51:31.114
UNDER DISCUSSION IS TO REFER --

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:32.482
TO THE REGULATIONS ALREADY BEEN

02:51:32.548 --> 02:51:34.384
A ALREADY PROMULGATED BY THE

02:51:34.450 --> 02:51:36.285
AGENCY AND THEY HAVE A

02:51:36.352 --> 02:51:37.420
DEFINITION OF RELIABLE

02:51:37.487 --> 02:51:38.855
INFORMATION THAT RECALL --

02:51:38.921 --> 02:51:40.256
REFERS TO PEER REVIEWED

02:51:40.323 --> 02:51:42.258
LITERATURE AND OTHER SOURCES OF

02:51:42.325 --> 02:51:42.892
INFORMATION THAT ARE CONSIDERED

02:51:42.959 --> 02:51:45.128
RELIABLE AND THE BILL WILL POINT

02:51:45.194 --> 02:51:48.765
DIRECTLY TO THAT DEFINITION THE

02:51:48.831 --> 02:51:50.400
REGULATIONS.

02:51:50.466 --> 02:51:51.901
INTO THE CHAIR THERE'S ALSO IN

02:51:51.968 --> 02:51:54.037
THERE'S ALSO -- LANGUAGE ABOUT

02:51:54.103 --> 02:51:55.972
ABOUT -- DIGITS IS FIVE YOUR

02:51:56.039 --> 02:51:57.206
WORK PLANS.

02:51:57.273 --> 02:51:59.742
SHAPING SO AS TO REALLY MAKE

02:51:59.809 --> 02:52:00.309
SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS

02:52:00.376 --> 02:52:02.145
WORK.

02:52:02.211 --> 02:52:03.346
SO THE DRESSER VERY CAN

02:52:03.413 --> 02:52:03.646
[inaudible]

02:52:03.713 --> 02:52:04.580
YEAH.

02:52:04.647 --> 02:52:06.215
THANK YOU FOR THIS CLARIFYING

02:52:06.282 --> 02:52:08.217
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

02:52:08.284 --> 02:52:10.386
UP.

02:52:10.453 --> 02:52:13.156
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER CAM.

02:52:13.222 --> 02:52:16.459
THANK YOU CHAIR -- I JUST WANT

02:52:16.526 --> 02:52:18.394
TO YOU KNOW SAY THAT I THINK.

02:52:18.461 --> 02:52:20.163
CLEARLY AS THE CHAIRMAN CHEN

02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:21.397
THEIR SITUATIONS LIKE LEADING

02:52:21.464 --> 02:52:22.865
CHILDREN'S STORY THAT ARE BLACK

02:52:22.932 --> 02:52:24.200
AND WHITE BUT WE SAW WOULD BE P.

02:52:24.267 --> 02:52:25.501
A. B. PS THAT WHEN WE BàN

02:52:25.568 --> 02:52:26.769
SOMETHING WE CAN HAVE

02:52:26.836 --> 02:52:28.237
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES AND I

02:52:28.304 --> 02:52:28.538
THINK THAT.

02:52:28.604 --> 02:52:30.473
THIS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED IN A

02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:32.508
WAY THAT WAS SMART RIGHT THAT WE

02:52:32.575 --> 02:52:33.576
LOOK AT THE SCIENCE THAT WE

02:52:33.643 --> 02:52:34.844
DON'T MAKE REGRETTABLE DECISIONS

02:52:34.911 --> 02:52:35.978
THAT DOWN THE ROAD CREATE MORE

02:52:36.045 --> 02:52:37.013
TOXIC OUTCOMES FOR OUR

02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:39.282
CONSTITUENTS THAN WE HAD BEFORE.

02:52:39.348 --> 02:52:40.383
AND SO I WANT TO THANK SENATOR

02:52:40.450 --> 02:52:41.484
ALLEN FOR BRINGING THIS IN FOR

02:52:41.551 --> 02:52:43.386
LOOKING LONG AND HARD AT HOW WE

02:52:43.453 --> 02:52:45.321
CAN MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK

02:52:45.388 --> 02:52:46.355
BECAUSE IN ITS DESIGN.

02:52:46.422 --> 02:52:47.590
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHICH

02:52:47.657 --> 02:52:48.791
IS USE GOOD SCIENCE TO MAKE

02:52:48.858 --> 02:52:49.859
DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS THE BEST

02:52:49.926 --> 02:52:50.693
THING FOR THE CONSTITUENTS OF

02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:52.028
CALIFORNIA AND SO WE NEED TO GET

02:52:52.095 --> 02:52:53.496
IT WORKING DESIGN WASN'T ENOUGH

02:52:53.563 --> 02:52:55.198
RIGHT WHEN IT FUNCTIONING AND I

02:52:55.264 --> 02:52:57.100
HOPE THAT THIS WILL -- WORK I

02:52:57.166 --> 02:52:59.235
DON'T THINK IT HAS A SUNSET BUT

02:52:59.302 --> 02:53:00.770
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AS

02:53:00.837 --> 02:53:02.238
REVISITING THIS IS HOME POINT
