BASER ELIGIBLE CHILDREN- WHO.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:05.458
WHO CAN IDENTIFY DIRECTLY. ON IT

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:07.527
AS AS YOU CAN SEE ON ON ON YOUR

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.295
CHART UNDER A LOT OF

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:14.967
SIMILARITIES. PROGRAMS THE-

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.435
BASED ON CHANGES YEAR THE FIRM

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:18.404
RAIDS ARE AS IN THE SAME THING

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.605
THAT- MARKET RATES FOR EACH

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:21.174
COUNTY. I'M THEY HAVE SIMILAR

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.141
STOCK RATIO- AND THEY ARE BASED

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.476
ON OUR FAMILY ELIGIBILITY AND

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:25.478
HOURS OF CARE- THAT'S THE

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:28.147
PRIMARY DIFFERENCE HERE IS THIS

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:29.782
RELATED TO WHETHER IT'S- ABOUT

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:31.751
YOUR FAMILY'S. CHOICE OVER THE

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.352
PROGRAM TO GO TO OUR A DIRECT

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.654
CONTRACT WITH FAMILIES ARE

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.290
COMING DIRECTLY. FROM THE

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:38.658
TEACHER QUALIFICATIONS ARE ALSO

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:40.159
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND THAT THE

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.627
CONTRACT BASED- THE DRUG

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:44.597
CONTRACTORS HAVE SOMEONE HIGHER-

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.666
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NUMBER OF.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.435
COLLEGE CREDITS AND SPECIFICALLY

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:50.002
EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:56.342
UNITS AS WELL- UP IN THE. TWO TO

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.344
BE STUCK IN THE PROGRAM. I

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.146
SPEAKING ABOUT HAVING THESE PRO

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.480
COMPARED THE OTHER THE SCHOOL

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.282
BASED PROGRAMS I WILL TALK ABOUT

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:04.417
IT'S ONE HUNDRED A COUPLE

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:05.885
KEEPING- ONE OF THAT FAMILY

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:06.452
ELIGIBILITY IS THE STARTING

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.688
POINT SO IN ORDER TO BE IN ON

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.089
THIS PROGRAM- YOU NEED TO

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.057
DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT THE

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.859
FARMERS DEMONSTRATE THE BAY-

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:15.228
THEY ARE BELOW THE INCOME

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:17.396
THRESHOLD WHICH IS 85% OF THE

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:18.631
CITY STATE MEDIAN INCOME. WHICH

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.600
COMES OUT TO SEVENTY EIGHT

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.201
THOUSAND FOR A FAMILY OF THREE-

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:23.703
AND THEN THAT THERE IS A NEED

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:24.670
FOR CARE WHILE THE PARENTS ARE

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:27.907
WORKING OR IN SCHOOL OR LOOKING

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:30.443
FOR JOBS- SO THE PROVIDERS HOURS

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:33.279
CAN VERY- THEIR AVAILABILITY BUT

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.348
THE GOAL IS JUST TO SPECIFICALLY

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:37.316
PROVIDE THE AMOUNT OF CARE

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:38.284
NECESSARY PERFECT FOR FAMILIES

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.319
TO WORK TO GO TO SCHOOL TO LOOK

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.655
FOR WORK- AND THEN EVERYTHING

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.524
THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.858
DIFFERENCES FROM THIS PROGRAM

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:46.726
FROM FROM FROM THE SCHOOL BASED

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:49.362
PROGRAMS. THE OTHER KEY IS THAT-

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:51.364
NO ALTHOUGH SOME SOME OF THESE

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.832
PROGRAMS MAY BE ON SCHOOL

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:53.599
CAMPUSES IT'S NOT TYPICAL THESE

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.167
ARE TYPICALLY RUN BY PRIVATE

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:57.403
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS-

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.639
THE AREA THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:02.541
YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW ON A SCHOOL

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:09.615
CAMPUS ARE NOT DESIGNED.

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:10.583
SPECIFICALLY AROUND SCHOOL- SO

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.685
I'M NOMINAL WATER ON THE ON THE

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:14.520
NEXT WE OUR A CHART THAT WALK

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:16.389
THROUGH THE MAIN LONG EXPAND

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:16.989
LEARNING FOR THAT WORK BETTER

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.624
SCHOOL BASED- AND THE TWO

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.359
PROGRAMS ARE ONE OF THE ASUS

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:22.228
PROGRAM AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:23.496
FIFTY PROGRAM WHICH IS THE STATE

00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:24.664
FUNDED PROGRAM AND THEN THE

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.432
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- COMMUNITY

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.166
LEARNING CENTERS WHICH IS THE

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.669
FEDERAL FUNDED PROGRAM- THERE

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.938
ARE A LOT OF SMALL DIFFERENCES

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:33.406
BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS BUT I WANT

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.341
TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE KEY THINGS

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.376
THAT AGAIN WE DISTINGUISH THEM

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:39.478
FROM THE OTHER PROGRAMS. FIRST-

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:40.746
THE IS SOME SIMILAR. WITH THE

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:42.448
DIRECT. OF EMPLOYMENT THERE.

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.283
GRANTS AWARDED SPECIFIC SCHOOL

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.920
SITES- SO THERE IS A AN

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:48.654
APPLICATION PROCESS THAT YOU

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.556
NEED TO APPLY FOR JOBS TO BE

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.191
ABLE TO RECEIVE THE GRANT

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.526
FUNDING- AND THEN THE PRIORITY

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:55.361
IS PROVIDED TO THOSE SCHOOLS

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.163
THAT ARE SERVING HIGHER

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:58.531
PROPORTIONS OF LOW INCOME

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:00.333
STUDENTS. I'M THE ONE KEY

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:00.933
DIFFERENCE THOUGH THE PROGRAM

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.501
ELIGIBILITY IS NOT LIMITED TO

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:04.437
LOW INCOME. SO IF THEY THE

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.372
SCHOOL SITE KEVIN THIS IS CRAP.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.274
THEY DON'T HAVE THE ONLY SERVE

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:10.142
KIDS WHO WILL MEET IN

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:10.977
COMPRESSION BUT- AND THERE THERE

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:13.212
IS NO SORT OF INCOME ELIGIBILITY

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.214
TO BE ABLE TO ENROLL- SCHOOLS

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:18.317
MAY USE- INCOME. THE FAMILY'S

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:20.152
INCOME TO SAY PRIORITIZE THAT

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:21.120
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:23.522
EVERYBODY. OR THEY MIGHT- THEY

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.558
MIGHT DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:26.726
THEY DON'T. THEY ARE NOT

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.427
PROHIBITED FROM CERTAIN

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:29.362
QUESTIONS- SIMILARLY THEY THEY

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:31.530
CAN CHOOSE TO- CHARGE FAMILY

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:34.333
FEES ARE FOR THOSE FAMILIES WERE

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.768
NOT LOW INCOME SO UNDER THE ASUS

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:38.371
PROGRAM IN THE 20% TO PROGRAM-

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:41.374
AT. PROGRAMS CANNOT CHARGE FEES

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.541

FOR HOMELESS YOUTH OF. FOR OTHER

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:47.646
FAMILIES IT IS OPTIONAL AND SO

00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:53.619
IN SOME CASES THERE MAY BE SOME.

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:54.453
FAMILIES ARE PAYING. I'M THIS

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.721
PROGRAM ARE BUILT PRIMARY AROUND

SCHOOL COMPONENT OR SOME KIND OF

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:06.999
SUMMER COMPONENT BUT THAT'S NOT

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:09.368
COMMON. ON THESE ARE TYPICALLY-

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:10.603
HELPING TO SORT OF BRIDGE THE

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:13.039
GAP BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE

AND SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS. GOOD

00:11:56.715 --> 00:12:00.186
NOW- MILLER. TURTLE PAGE OF OUR

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:01.454
CHART TO TALK ABOUT THE EXPANDED

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.822
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.356
SO THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM THAT

00:12:04.423 --> 00:12:06.392
WAS CREATED. LAST YEAR IN THE

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:10.129
BUDGET- A SCHOOL BASED- PROGRAM

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:11.530
OF THE STATE PROVIDED ONE POINT

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:12.598
EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:15.000
PROVENTIA FUNDING IN TWENTY ONE

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:16.569
TWENTY TWO TO ESTABLISH THE

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:17.837
PROGRAM. AND THERE IS- THE

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:18.471
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:19.672
AND THE LEGISLATURE HAD INTENT

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:21.107
THAT. IT THE PROGRAM WILL REACH

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:24.610
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:25.578
FIVE TWENTY SIX- AND THE

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:27.513
GOVERNORS BUT THIS YEAR INCLUDES

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.781
FUNDING TO GET THE PROGRAM UP TO

00:12:28.848 --> 00:12:30.583
FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:31.617
ALMOST ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:33.719
BELIEVE. I AM. BUT WE WOULD KNOW

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.454
IF THERE. IF THIS PROGRAM WERE

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:37.556
TO EXPAND AT THE AS INTENDED TO

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:38.924
GET UP TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:40.826
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN THIS

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:42.261
PROGRAM- WHAT'S GOING BUT HE'LL

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:44.463
BE PROGRAMS. WOULD IT WOULD

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.531
EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:46.866
THAT WE PROVIDE FOR ALL THE

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:48.501
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT I'VE ALREADY

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:50.936
MENTIONED SO IT'S A VERY

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:51.604
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FUNDING-

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.439
AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SERVE A

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:54.573
LOT MORE CHILDREN THAN WE

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.277
CURRENTLY DO- UNDER OUR CURRENT

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:00.045
PROGRAMS- THERE. THERE'S SOME.

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.414
SIMILAR OF A LOT OF THE ELEMENTS

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:04.250
OF BETA PROGRAM ARE SIMILAR TO

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.251
THE STATE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:07.887
READY- THE STAFFING RATIOS ARE

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:10.189
THE SAME NUMBER. TWENTY CHILDREN

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.258
FOR ONE ADULT- THAT MINIMUM

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:13.826
QUALIFICATIONS FOR STAFFING IS

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:15.528
ALSO THE FAME. AND THE SAME

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:17.429
ISSUE OF CHARGING FEES WHETHER

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:18.831
THAT IT'S OPTIONAL BUT YOU

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:19.665
CANNOT CHARGE FEES TO LOW INCOME

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.800
FAMILIES ALMOST BEFORE YOU POST.

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:22.902
THOSE COMPONENTS ARE STILL

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:26.572
THERE- THERE ARE SOME KEY. THAT

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.340
ARE THAT I WOULD TO HIGHLIGHT-

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:29.608
THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT THIS

00:13:29.675 --> 00:13:31.343
IS NOT A COMPETITIVE GRANT

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.012
PROGRAMS FUNDING TO PROVIDED TO

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:33.812
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:37.349
SCHOOLS. THE FARM THE BETTER- A

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:39.218
PERCENTAGE OF THEIR STUDENTS

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:42.688
THAT ARE- INDICATOR SIX THAT ARE

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.890
LOW INCOME OR ENGLISH LEARNERS.

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:46.525
HAPPENING IS PROVIDED FOR THEM-

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:47.726
IT'S NOT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:49.461
CHILDREN THAT THEY'RE SERVING AS

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:50.863
A STATE PHARMACY THIS OVERALL

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.865
FORMULA. AND SO IT IT IS. A

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:54.433
BIGGER PART OF FORMING THE BAND

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.434
DISTRICTS TO CHOOSE HOW TO

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.336
ALLOCATE WHAT THEYWANT TO FOCUS

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:58.504
ON ONE PARTICULAR SCHOOL SPREAD

00:13:58.571 --> 00:13:59.505
OUT THROUGHOUT THE OLDER AREAS

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:00.606
WHERE THERE IS FLEXIBILITY FOR

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:06.178
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DECIDE- IT-

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:07.413
IT'S NOT BASED. THIS FINDING

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:08.514
ABOUT IS NOT BE. ON

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:10.616
PARTICIPATION. IT'S BASED ON-

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.651
THE T. THIRTY. CHARACTERS THE

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:15.688
COMMITMENT OF THE OF THE SCHOOL

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:16.722
DISTRICT- THE OTHER KEEPING THAT

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:18.357
I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THE

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:20.526
REQUIREMENT FOR SUMMER SO BUT IN

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:21.827
TERMS OF THE SCHOOL DAY THEY'RE

00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:23.329
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THERE WERE

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.663
THIRTY DEFINITELY BUT BY AND

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.431
LARGE. BUT DURING THE SCHOOL

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:27.199
YEAR REQUIREMENTS ARE VERY

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:28.434
SIMILAR TO YOU SINCE- SO WE

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.935
WOULD EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:33.405
BE- SIMILAR LEVELS OF COVERAGE

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:34.640
DURING THAT AT THREE BUT- THE

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:35.841
BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:37.910
KNOW PM ASUS IS THAT IT DOES

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:39.178
HAVE A SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:43.582
THAT THE PROGRAM BE OPEN. FOR

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:45.217
THIRTY DAYS DURING. DURING OUR

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:46.585
OR OUT OF SCHOOL WITH LIKELY

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:47.586
MISS SUMMER BUT ALSO COULD BE

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:49.421
DURING INTERSESSION. BREAK OUT

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.223
AND THAT THREE DURING THOSE

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.524
THREE DAYS TO BE MAYBE A BRAND

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:53.559
NEW NINE HOURS A DAY ABOUT

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:55.227
SOMETHING THAT AN IMPORTANT.

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:56.228
REQUIREMENT THAT DOESN'T EXIST

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.963
RIGHT NOW UNDER THE EXISTING

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.867
EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS. MMHM

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:03.502
SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:06.405
THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES HERE- I

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:08.507
THINK BOTH OF BRISTOL STOP HERE

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.476
IN TERMS OF THE SUMMARY TRYING

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:11.010
TO WALK THROUGH THE THREE

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:12.378
DIFFERENT PIECES I WOULD JUST

00:15:12.444 --> 00:15:14.013
WHEN I GET A BIG PICTURE YOU'LL

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.315

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:16.949

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.718
FIELD AFTER AFTER I FINISH

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:20.586
TALKING BUT I THINK THIS

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:21.620
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:23.489
CREATES OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER

00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:25.324

PARTNER WITH THEM SO- HOPEFULLY

DISTRICTS OR CHARTER SCHOOLS-

00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:38.443

CONCERNS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:43.114
CHALLENGES JOHN. WE DON'T EVEN

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:47.018
THIS BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY

00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:50.222
MUCH IN A SURVIVAL MODE OF

00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:51.656
HAVING THE PEOPLE THAT COULD

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:53.058
WORK WITH THAT- HE'S LEARNING.

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:54.826
OR WORKING AFTER SCHOOL THERE

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.394
SOBBING THEY'RE HAVING TO FILL

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:57.596
IN AT CENTRE AND I'M THIS IS

00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:59.798
ACROSS THE STATE I'M SURE. SO

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:00.899
ONE THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:02.968
BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR THEM. THE

00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:04.636
BLAST SCENE IS I TELL THEM IS

00:25:04.703 --> 00:25:05.971
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US THE

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:09.374
FLEXIBILITY. TO REALLY PLAN AND

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:11.142
HAVE TIME TO PLAN SO IT WASN'T

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:13.378
JUST SOMETHING THAT. YOU SENT TO

00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:14.746
US AND SAID OKAY WE NEED A BY

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:16.815
SUCH AND SUCH DATE. AND THAT'S

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:18.917
THE BEAUTY OF WHAT THIS THIS

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:20.719
FUNDING IS ALLOWING US TO DO IS

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:22.520

AS YOU SAID TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:26.324
THE COMMUNITY AND I KEEP

00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:27.292
REMINDING. OUR DISTRICTS AS

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:29.060
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO REALLY DO

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:30.929
IS MEET WITH OUR PARENTS AND SEE

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:32.530
WHAT. WHAT OTHER CONFUSION MAYBE

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.499
BECAUSE THERE WAS CONFUSION WITH

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:36.801
YELLOW G. TWO YELLOW PEAS AND

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.203
SOME PEOPLE BLENDED THOSE TWO

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:43.508
GUYS WAIT A MINUTE THAT'S- IT'S

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:45.710
KIND OF SIMILAR BUT IT REALLY IS

00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:47.612
AS- IN THEN NOW WE HAVE U. P.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.813
SO. IT'S REALLY GETTING THE

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.115
MESSAGE OUT ABOUT. LET YOU BREAK

00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:51.616
IT DOWN WHAT'S WHY AND WHO WERE

00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:53.151
SERVING. IN HIS BUT LIKE

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:54.352
CHRISTINA SAID. THE SERVING FOUR

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:57.155
YEAR OLD IS A CHALLENGE BUT I'LL

00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:57.789
LEAVE THAT TO HER HER- ARMANEN

00:25:57.856 --> 00:25:59.391
HEARD KNOWLEDGE TO BE ABLE TO

00:25:59.457 --> 00:26:00.692
REALLY WORK WITH ME. AND HOW WE

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:02.694
LOOK FORWARD TO MOVE FORWARD

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:05.063
WITH EXPANDED LEARNING. ONE OF

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.398
THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS WE

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:07.832
DON'T JUST PREACH AND NOT

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:09.701
PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH WE'VE

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:12.370
BEEN MODELING CAPS OF NINE HOURS

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:14.506
TOO SO DISTRICTS CAN SEE HOW THE

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:16.107
DAY LOOKS ESPECIALLY IN THOSE

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:18.209
INTERCESSION SUMMER PROGRAMS. IS

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:19.644
IT BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:21.479
CONCERN ARE YOU SURE WE HAVE TO

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:23.381
RUN A NINE HOUR PROGRAM. SO WE

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.650
CAN BREAK IT DOWN AND HOLDING

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:26.885
CAMPS WITH STUDENTS SO THEY

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:29.754
COULD SEE HOW THAT MAY LOOK IN

00:26:29.821 --> 00:26:31.556
DURING SUMMER SESSION. GOOD IT'S

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:32.590
ALWAYS BEEN AS I MENTIONED

00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:33.992
EARLIER. WHERE PEOPLE SAY WE

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:35.360
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:38.063
THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO DO.

00:26:38.129 --> 00:26:39.164
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT OLD

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.466
SAYING NO MONEY NO MISSION BUT

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:43.835
THEY FORGET THE SECOND PART OF

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:45.370
THAT SCENE WHICH- THERE'S NO

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.806
MISSION. NO NEED FOR MONEY SO I

00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:49.808
REMINDED DISTRICTS IS. THAT

00:26:49.874 --> 00:26:51.943
REALLY LET'S HAVE A MISSION HAVE

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.678
YOUR MISSION AND YOUR GOAL OF

00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:56.247
WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO. BEFORE NOW

00:26:56.314 --> 00:26:59.150
YOU HAVE THE MONEY SO WE CAN

00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:00.785
REALLY SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:01.753
COMMUNITY. I LIKE TO CALL IT

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.756
IT'S TEA TIME. IN TV BECAUSE-

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:07.025
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO NASA. AND

00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:08.326
WE WILL HAVE TRIALS AND

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:10.328
TRIBULATIONS DURING THIS TIME.

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:12.364
AND OF COURSE YES IT'S GOING TO

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.799
TAKE TIME TO GET THIS TO GET

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:17.168
THIS OFF THE GROUND AND REALLY

00:27:17.235 --> 00:27:18.903
ENOUGH TO DESERVE TO DESIGN

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.006
PROGRAMS. THAT WE CAN SERVE THE

00:27:21.072 --> 00:27:22.574
NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND TO

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.176
ALSO. SHAKE THE BUSHES TO SEE

00:27:25.243 --> 00:27:27.312
WHO ELSE WE CAN BRING ON BOARD

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:30.515
THAT HAVE BEEN AND MISSING

00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:31.783
DURING THIS PANDEMIC HERE. I

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.319
JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH THIS IF

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:36.421
I MAY TWO DAYS. THE READ ACROSS

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:39.958
AMERICA AND BLUE I KNOW DOCTOR

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:41.960
RESIGNED AND I REDEEM TO SCHOOLS

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:43.795
LATER NOW I'M GONNA READ THAT

00:27:43.862 --> 00:27:45.463
I'M READING TO THE STUDENTS A

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.065
MAGIC IS IN YOU. BY COLIN

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:50.135
HOSTING AND BROOKLYN TELL. THEN

00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:52.370
IT SIMPLY SAYS IT'S HARD TO

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:54.606
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND. JUST

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:58.576
REMEMBER THE MAGIC IS IN YOU. TO

00:27:58.643 --> 00:27:59.644
CREATE A FUTURE OF BEAUTIFUL

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:01.513
MEMORIES AND I THINK THAT FITS

00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:03.314
WITH THIS HEARING TODAY AND THAT

SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

FAMILY NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT AND

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:01.806
DIVERSE AND IT IS THE

00:39:01.872 --> 00:39:03.674
RESPONSIBILITY WE BELIEVE OF

WHERE THEY ARE IN THE MOST

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:14.685
RESPONSIVE WAY. THAT DOES NOT

00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:16.120
COME WITHOUT THE CHALLENGE. ON

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:18.789
WE OPERATE OUR PROGRAMS BY

BLENDING FUNDING WE PROVIDE WE

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:23.928

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:31.335
WE USE EARLY HEAD START DOLLARS

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:33.804
PLUS THE CTR DOLLARS TO SERVE

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:36.073
OUR INFANTS AND TODDLERS. ON I

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.342
WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT WE

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:40.578
ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:42.913
TO BRAID FUNDING. BUT IT DOES

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.716
NOT COME WITHOUT ITS CHALLENGES

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.651
OUR FAMILIES AND OUR PROVIDER

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.720
MUST ENSURE THAT FAMILIES MEET

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:51.722
THE CRITERIA OF BOTH FUNDING

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.791
SOURCES. AND THOSE FUNDING

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:55.226
SOURCES ARE NOT ALWAYS

00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:57.461
CONSISTENT SO WHILE A CHILD

00:39:57.528 --> 00:40:01.098
FAMILY MAY QUALIFY FOR C. S. P.

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.033
P. SERVICES THEY DO NOT QUALIFY

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.568
FOR HEAD START SERVICES

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:06.737
POTENTIALLY. AND THAT MEANS THAT

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:08.539
IF WE'VE GRADED FUNDING IN A

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.341
CLASSROOM THAT FAMILY CANNOT

00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:12.576
PARTICIPATE IN THAT CLASSROOM.

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:14.378

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.147
PRETZELS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:18.449

THOSE WORDS AND I KNOW HOW

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:16.473
IMPORTANT IT IS ON A DAY TO DAY

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.243
BASIS TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.312
JOINED THE FAMILY. IN HELPING

THRIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:31.121
DIFFICULT FOR THEM AND THAT IS

00:41:31.188 --> 00:41:31.989
OUR GOAL. JUST SO THAT YOU

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:34.792
REALIZE 49% OF OUR FAMILIES ARE

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:38.229

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:40.965
31% OF OUR FAMILIES NOW SELF

IDENTIFY AS HOMELESS. 57% OF OUR

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.872
FAMILIES ARE SPANISH SPEAKERS.

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:50.674
ON RIGHT NOW EARLY ADD FACES A

00:41:50.741 --> 00:41:52.743
MAJOR CRISIS AND THAT IS A

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.479
CRISIS OF TEACHERS QUALIFIED

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:57.882
TEACHERS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

PL AND VERY LONG HISTORY. WE

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.685
HAVE CHILDREN ON THE WAITING

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:04.154
LIST NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:05.623
OPENINGS FOR CHILDREN BUT

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:08.292
BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE TEACHERS

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:10.928
TO PUT IN CLASSROOMS THIS HAS

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:15.466
BECOME A CRISIS EARLY EDUCATION

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:17.801
. PART OF THE CRISIS IS HYPE.

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:20.170
THAT PREPARES PEOPLE TO JOIN A

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:22.339
PROFESSION THAT IS THE CENTRAL

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:24.341
IMPORTANCE IN NOT ONLY THE LIVES

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:26.377

ANGELES MORE AND MORE OF OUR

CLASSROOMS TO MEET FAMILY NEEDS.

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:49.266

OLDER THEY JOINED THE YOUTH

FAMILY. ONE OF OUR MAJOR

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:09.960
HIGHLIGHTS I WOULD SAY WITHIN

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:11.061
OUR DEPARTMENT OF AFTER SCHOOL

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.429
IS THAT INTERCESSION FOR THE

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:14.831
PROGRAMS. AND THAT IS OUR MAN R.

00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:18.569

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:22.506
SPRING AND FALL PROGRAMS THAT WE

GOING TO. US REALLY BECOME TO A

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:28.679
DAY. AS I MENTIONED SCHOOLS ARE.

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:30.247
YOU KNOW COMMUTER SCHOOLS AND IN

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:32.015
THE DOWNTOWN AREA SO MANY OF OUR

00:47:32.082 --> 00:47:34.818
FAMILIES ACTUALLY FOR TWO OUT OF

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:37.120
THREE. LIVE OUTSIDE OF THAT THE

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.022
COMMUNITY SO THIS REALLY HELPS

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:40.624
US AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:44.428

00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:46.396
PROGRAMMING FOR OUR STUDENTS.

00:47:46.463 --> 00:47:49.533
CURRENTLY DURING THE SUMMER AND

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.169
THE SPRING BREAK. AND THE BALL

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:53.804
PROGRAM WE OFFER A PRETTY

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:56.039
EXTENSIVE DAY BUT WITH THE

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:57.541
SUPPORT I WOULD DEFINITELY LET

00:47:57.608 --> 00:47:59.576
US INCREASE OUR NUMBERS AS WE

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.511
STILL HAVE SOME WEIGHTLESS. I

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:03.080
WAS SPECIAL HIGHLIGHT OF ALL

00:48:03.146 --> 00:48:04.581
THOSE PROGRAMS IS THAT WE REALLY

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:07.317
FOCUS ON COMMUNITY EXPLORATION.

00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:09.052
DURING THE INTERSESSION PROGRAMS

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:10.420
WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO TAKE THE

00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:12.122
KIDS OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:13.957
HAVE THEM EXPLORE AND LEARN. NEW

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:16.426
PLACES THAT HONESTLY IF IT WOULD

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:17.828
HAVE BEEN FOR OUR PROGRAMS THEY

00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:18.729
WOULDN'T PROBABLY HAVE AN

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:22.633
OPPORTUNITY. TO ATTEND ALL THOSE

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:23.400
PLACES. BUT ALONG WITH

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:24.835
HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD THINGS IN

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:26.236
OUR PROGRAMS ALSO ROADBLOCKS.

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:27.871
AND ONE OF THE BIG ONES IS

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.973
WEIGHTLESS. YOU KNOW I DOLLARS

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.142
ONLY SO GO STRAIGHT IN. YOU KNOW

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:34.511
WAY SO WE STILL HAVE. QUITE A

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:36.013
FEW NUMBER OF STUDENTS ON THE

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.748
WAITLIST AS YOU KNOW THE GRASS

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:41.084
ONLY ALLOW US TO SERVE X. AMOUNT

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:42.219
OF STUDENTS. ANOTHER BIRD AND

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:43.487
THAT HURTS OUR BUDGET IS THE

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:44.988
COST OF FACILITIES AND

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:46.757
MAINTENANCE OUR BUDGETS ARE

00:48:46.823 --> 00:48:48.392
ALREADY SO TIGHT BUT YOU KNOW

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:50.193
THESE ARE EXPENSES THAT. YOU

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.195
KNOW ARE NEEDED FRENCH STATE

00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.564
TODAY PROGRAMMING. AND AS OTHERS

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:55.899
HAVE MENTIONED THE WORK FORCE

00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:58.635
ISSUES AND PAY IS CRITICAL- WE

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.637
TEND TO BE VERY SHORT STAFFED

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:03.540
AND THAT. THIS TIME- AND WE ALSO

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:04.508
NEED TO STAY COMPETITIVE WITH

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:06.677
SALARIES YOU KNOW S. RECRUITMENT

00:49:06.743 --> 00:49:08.445
HAS ALSO BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:10.147
ACROSS THE FIELD I SEE HERE IN

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:12.215
EARLY AND IT IS THE SAME FOR.

00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:14.785
OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROVIDERS. SO

00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:16.353
THE OTHER CRUCIAL THING IS THAT

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.690
ABILITY TO HAVE STAFF- COVERED

00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:23.226
DIFFERENT. MASSES OR PLACES.

00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:24.227
BECAUSE OF THE GRANT

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:25.762
REQUIREMENTS LIKE I MENTIONED WE

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.597
HAVE DIFFERENT GRANTS SO THEY

00:49:27.664 --> 00:49:29.066
HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:33.637
STAFFING- AND LASTLY. IN ORDER

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:34.871
TO MAKE ALL THIS POSSIBLE WE

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:37.207
DEPEND HIGHLY ON OUR EXTERNAL

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:39.142
AFFAIRS TEAMS TO HAVE THE

00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:40.811
CAPACITY TO. FIND ADDITIONAL

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:42.612
FUNDING SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO.

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:43.880
HAVE MORE STUDENTS IN OUR

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:46.483
PROGRAMS OR DOES INTERCESSION

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.618
SUMMER DAYS AND- LIKE I

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:50.821
MENTIONED BEFORE. ANY OTHER

00:49:50.887 --> 00:49:52.556
EXTRA FUNDING WOULD DEFINITELY

00:49:52.622 --> 00:49:54.958
HELP WAS REALLY HAPPY MORE KIDS

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:57.060
IN OUR PROGRAM AS IT IS. REALLY

00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:58.762
SAD AND DIFFICULT TO TURN AWAY

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:00.297
STUDENTS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.165
ENOUGH FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:05.102
PROGRAM FOR EVERYONE- FOR I AND

MONTHS OF IT- I REALIZED THAT MY

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:15.184
SON NEEDED A LOT OF HELP AND

00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:16.052
ASSISTANCE. I CAN AFFORD

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:17.921
CHILDCARE WHEN THEY WERE SMALLER

00:59:17.987 --> 00:59:19.489
SO I QUIT MY JOB AND I MADE

00:59:19.555 --> 00:59:23.293
SEVERAL SACRIFICES TO STAY WITH

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:24.827
THEM UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO GO

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:26.129
TO SCHOOL. SO WHEN MY KIDS ARE

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:27.897
LOOKING TO BUY. REALIZED THAT HE

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:29.132
WAS AT A HUGE DISADVANTAGE

00:59:29.198 --> 00:59:31.401
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY EARLY

00:59:31.467 --> 00:59:33.536
EDUCATION SETTING A BACKGROUND.

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:35.838
SO IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME

00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:37.073
. LAST YEAR TO FIND AN AFTER

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.542
SCHOOL PROGRAM FOR HIM HE HAS AN

00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:42.745
I. P. AND I LOOK AT THE TV EVEN

00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:43.880
WORKING FINE AS HE STRUGGLED

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:46.983
WITH THE MOST MONEY. AND THAT

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.618
WAS A HUGE SETBACK FOR HIM. SO

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:50.520
AT THE WORST TIME TO APPLY FOR

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:51.854
THE FOR AND PROGRAMS I BEGAN

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.389
ASKING QUESTIONS AND RESEARCHING

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:54.223
PROGRAMS AROUND. OUR

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:56.059
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SCHOOL.

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:57.894
FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO FIND A

00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.196
PROGRAM WITH PRETTY EARLY IN THE

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:00.730
PROCESS THE LIKE QUICKLY

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:03.733
COMMUNICATED WITH THEM THE

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.801
MINUTE OUR APPLICATION. AND MY

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.569
FAMILY MET THE ELIGIBILITY

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:07.470
CRITERIA SO I WAS ABLE TO GET

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:09.339
THE KIDS IN AN AFTER SCHOOL

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:10.873
PROGRAM AT NO COST PLUS. WITH

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.209
THE BLESSING. AND I'M BARELY

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.811
STARTING TO FOCUS ON MYSELF OF

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.946
MY FAMILY. MAKE THEM GROW AND

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:20.316
THEN. THE APPLICATION HOWEVER

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.484
FOR THEM TO GET THEM IN THOSE

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:23.586
PROGRAMS WAS NOT EASY THERE WAS

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:25.922
A LOT OF REQUIRED BEFORE BACKING

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:26.656
FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:29.192
STAFF- KOBE MADE IT VERY

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:30.927
DIFFICULT BECAUSE- THE

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:33.196
ACCESSIBILITY AND LIMITED HOURS

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:35.131
AND FAT STORAGE SHORTAGES THAT

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:37.533
THERE WERE- BUT I MAKE SURE THAT

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.102
THEY HAD EVERYTHING AT THE END

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.837
OF IT. THE COMPLETE EVERYTHING

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:44.774
IN ONE BECAUSE. IT HAPPENS A LOT

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:45.575
THE BILLABLE. ALTHOUGH I VERY TO

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:48.011
HAVE HAD ACTED AT THE LOCAL AT

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:50.680
MY SON'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IT

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.148
WAS CLEAR THAT THEY WERE. ARE

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:54.050
YOU LIMITED IN WHAT THEY CAN

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:54.784
OFFER BECAUSE THE EXHIBITION

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:57.587
FUNDING AND STAFF SHORTAGES.

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:58.621
THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO HELP MY

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.757
FRIEND HIS MARK. AS THEY ONLY

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:02.458
HAD ENOUGH STAFF MEETING THE

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.193
BASIC THE PROVISION OF CHILDREN

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.196
AND NOT OFFERING ONE ON ONE FOR

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:08.664
. ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT HIM TO

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:12.201
HELP HIM S MUCH I DO- YOU KNOW

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.536
THAT IT MAKES THINGS A LITTLE

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:15.104
HARDER FOR US. OUR DAYS ARE

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:18.274
REALLY LONG. NOT ON BOARD FOR

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:19.909
FIRST GRADERS ALONG OTHER

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:24.547
CHILDREN- WHEN THE WHOLE THEY'RE

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:25.715
BASICALLY OVER. AND THEN THE

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:27.417
SEVERAL HOURS IN THE AFTER

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.451
SCHOOL PROGRAM IS DIFFICULT I

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.953
ALSO KNOW THAT MY SON IS A VERY

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.056
FIFTY BODY. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:34.557
THAT HAS INCORPORATED PHYSICAL

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.793
ACTIVITY. THE GETTING USED TO

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:39.395
HIS BODY WOULD BE GREAT. AND

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.097
ALSO GOOD FOR HIS HEALTH. IN A

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:42.632
PERFECT WORLD AFTER SCHOOL

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:44.367
PROGRAMS WOULD BE FUNDED BALANCE

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:45.635
THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES WITH

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:47.437
HOMEWORK SUPPORT IF YOU GET THE

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:50.106
CHANCE TO START THEIR BODIES AND

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:51.674
BRAINS. AGAIN I DON'T BLAME THE

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:52.842
AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM TEACHER

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:55.378
THEY DO A GREAT JOB WITH MY SON.

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:56.879
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO EXPECT THEM

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:59.282
TO BUY THE WHOLE POINT OF IT ALL

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:00.750
THAT MUCH. I JUST WISH THAT THEY

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:01.584
HAD THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:04.787
SUPPORT IT CHILD'S INDIVIDUAL.

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.089
AS I MENTIONED MY FINEST BEHIND

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:07.857
ACADEMICALLY AND HAVE THE

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:10.126
NINETY. WHICH IS NEEDED TO GET

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:12.428
SERVICES. THE SERVICES NEEDED TO

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:15.398
TRANSITION THE JANUARY BUT HE

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:16.599
HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET THEM.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.234
BECAUSE OF THE STAFF SHORTAGE

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:21.037
AND THE LACK OF RESOURCES. I'M

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.338
CONCERNED THAT I WASN'T WHAT

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.574
ABOUT THIS RECENTLY- AND IN ALL

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.775
HONESTY I WAS UNDER THE

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:27.176
IMPRESSION THAT NINETY EIGHT

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.911
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:29.812
IN WRITING AND IT'S A BINDING

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:32.882
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FAMILY. OR

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:34.717
THE DISTRICT. ACCORDING TO THE

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:36.052
SCHOOL. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.420
RESOURCES OR STAFF TO HELP MY

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:40.623
CHILD WITH ME. IT HAS BEEN VERY

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.859
DISHEARTENING AND DEVASTATING.

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.660
BUT I'M TRYING MY BEST ADVOCATE

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:47.630
MY FRIEND AND I WILL DO THAT ALL

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:50.533
ALWAYS. WELL MY TWENTY FIRST

PRESCHOOL ALTHOUGH SHE WAS

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:55.671
ELIGIBLE I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:57.640
FALL FOR HER AND IF HE YOU NEAR

BUY ACROSS TOWN THANK. I REALLY

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:04.480
THINK PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.983
HELLO HOTEL DEPARTURE FOR AN

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:08.951

RESIDENCE. BUT THE FULL

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.391
PLACEMENT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.926
OF SOMETHING THAT THE FABRIC

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.494
FOR. DISTRICT HAS HAD A BIG

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:20.363
CHALLENGE WHAT. I COMMUNICATED A

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.698
WHILE AGO WITH THE PEOPLE NEAR

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:23.833
OUR HOME WHICH I HAD BEEN ON A

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.835
WAIT LIST FOR TWO YEARS. AND

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:28.204
LAST YEAR I GOT A CALL THAT

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:29.906
THERE WAS A BIG OPEN. BY

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:32.375
COMMUNICATED WITH THE TICKET FOR

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:33.843
THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS INVOLVED IN

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.044
. THE DROP HER ATTENDANCE AND

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.413
THAT WAS AN ISSUE IN ITSELF.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.548
ALTHOUGH I WASN'T GOING TO BE

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:40.249
PROBLEMATIC THE REALITY WAS THAT

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:42.485
I NEEDED THE PEACE OF MIND AND

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:43.553
HAVING FOUR KIDS IN DIFFERENT

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:44.987
SCHOOLS AND FAR FROM EACH OTHER.

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:47.957
IT'S JUST A BIG BURDEN FOR OUR

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:50.226
FAMILY. I FEEL FORTUNATE TO HAVE

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:51.627
BEEN ABLE TO GET A FAITH IN THE

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:53.396
PEOPLE PROVIDED BOTH FOR

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:55.431
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN OUR HOME.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.366
SO IT TOOK SEVERAL EMAIL CALL.

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:58.668
MAKE THAT CHANGE BUT I WOULD

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.503
PREFER THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.905
DO IT. WITHOUT THAT IF YOU WOULD

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:03.873
HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE STRESSFUL

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.943
ESPECIALLY WITH GAS PRICES.

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.010
BEING AT ALL TIME HIGH. I WOULD

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:10.146
HAVE TO DRIVE OR FIND

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:10.813
TRANSPORTATION FOR DIFFERENT

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.082
PART OF THE CITY AND STRUGGLE

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:14.317
WITH THAT. JUST TO CARE FOR MY

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:15.585
DAUGHTER. OR SPEND TIME AND

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.119
ENERGY FIFTEEN PER PROVIDER FOR

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:20.189
FIGHTING THE CHANGES THAT MET MY

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:21.991
FAMILY. THIS SYSTEM AS IT IS SET

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:23.793
UP BASICALLY CALLED GUARANTEE

01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:25.561
FIGURE OUT A- THEIR OWN.

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.563
FORTUNATELY MY KIDS ARE CLOSE IN

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.432
AGE. THAT'S THIS CALL CAN

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:31.234
CONTACT THIS TALENTED BUT THEN

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.370
THERE'S ALSO THE BENEFITS OF

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.572
THAT TOO. BUT I KNOW IT'S EVEN

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:37.540
HARDER FOR PARENTS WITH MORE OF

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.875
AN AGE GAP BETWEEN THEIR KID. IF

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:40.743
MY DAUGHTER WAS TWO FOR EXAMPLE

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:43.179
I KNOW I WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.747
MORE TO WORRY ABOUT. IT'S REALLY

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.148
A POINT TO HAVE A DEVELOPMENT.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:48.017
FINANCE DEVELOPMENTALLY

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:49.652
APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE FOR KIDS

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:52.021
OF ALL AGES. NEARBY PRESCHOOL

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:53.923
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MIDDLE SCHOOL.

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:56.125
HIGH SCHOOL THE PARENTS WOULD

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.560
HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR. OR WAIT ON

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:00.096
WE LISTS TO HELP CARE FOR THEIR

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:01.130
CHILDREN. THIS IS WHY IT'S

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.064
CRITICAL TO RAISE THE

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:05.201
REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR CHILDCARE

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:06.669
PROVIDERS AS WE ADD MORE STOCK.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.170
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:09.805
DEVASTATED WITH THE PANDEMIC AND

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:12.041
EVEN BEFORE THAT. THEY WERE

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:14.043
SEVERELY UNDER EIGHT. IF WE

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.077
DON'T RAISE THE REIMBURSEMENT

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.579
RATE PROVIDERS WILL CONTINUE TO

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:19.382
CLOSE AND IT WILL BE EVEN HARDER

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:21.150
FOR FAMILIES. FOR FAMILIES LIKE

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:22.318
MINE TO FIND HEALTH CARE FOR

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:23.886
THEIR YOUNG. WHEN YOU BUY THE

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:25.154
HOME. THANKS TO THE WORK FOR THE

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.490
BOARD OF THE OLDER KIDS. AS I

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.125
SAID I FEEL FORTUNATE TO HAVE

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:31.427
BOTH OF MY KIDS LEARNING- FOR.

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:33.462
NEAR ONE ANOTHER. I CAN'T

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:35.998
BELIEVE THAT IT TOOK A LOT OF MY

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:37.066
TIME AND EFFORT TO MAKE THAT

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:39.068
WORK. AND NOW. THAT'S NOT HOW IT

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.103
SHOULD BE. I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.406
OF MAKING THAT CHANGE DEPENDING

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.341
WHICH MY DAUGHTER FROM T. CASE.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.743
I'M A TEACHER OKAY GREAT C. K.

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.045
TO A PREPAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.513
THAT SHE WOULD PROBABLY LEARN

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.882
MORE MORE STUFF IN. A SETTING

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:56.419
BUT- WHEN I PUT. YOU WITH THE

BETWEEN OUR SECTORS THAT HAVE SO

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:13.976
MUCH IN COMMON- AND THEN WE

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.778
STARTED THIS WORK BEFORE KOBE

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:16.879
OUR PARTNERSHIP WAS REALLY

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:20.416
STRENGTHENS- WHEN OUR SECTORS

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:21.717
WERE DETERMINED TO BE

01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:23.018
EXCEPTIONAL WHICH WE ALWAYS KNEW

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:25.020

THIS ENOUGH ON THE FRONT LINES.

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:31.327
CARING FOR KIDS EVEN WHEN

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.728
SCHOOLS OPERATED REMOTELY. SO I

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:35.264
WANT TO BRING UP THE SLIDE THAT

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:37.266

OF MODELS FOR FAMILIES AS WELL

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.829
AND THEY HAVE A DEEP HISTORY OF

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:09.632
REALLY HAVING A FAMILY FOCUS AND

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.300
THEN YOU LOOK AT THE EXTENDED

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:12.568
LEARNING PROGRAMS AND THEY HAVE

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:13.936
A VERY STRONG LINK TO THE SCHOOL

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.537

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:28.784
FOCUS ON REALLY THE INTERSECTION

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:31.186

WELL AS- HOW MUCH THESE SECTORS

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.429
HAVE IN COMMON RIGHT I'M REALLY

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:42.731
THESE SECTORS ARE FOUNDED ON

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:43.365
PRIORITIZING THOSE MOST

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:45.567
UNDERSERVED. CHILDREN AND

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:49.171
FAMILIES. WE HAVE A VERY DIVERSE

BOTH OF OUR SECTORS ARE REALLY

01:11:56.211 --> 01:11:56.712
GROUNDED AND CHILD AND YOUTH

01:11:56.779 --> 01:12:00.449
DEVELOPMENT- AND WE ALL KNOW.

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:02.151
THAT DOSAGE IN QUALITY MATTERS

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.620
WHICH IS WHY RATES MATTER SO

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:07.823
MUCH- WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.358
SHARED CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:11.326
TO COMPENSATION SO REALLY

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:13.429
FOUNDATIONAL LEVI DO HAVE MORE

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:16.065

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.733
SAID YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE WE

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.101
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON DOESN'T

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.636
MEAN IT MAKES IT EASY TO BLEND

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:23.605
IN GRAY. WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:24.740
WORKING TOWARDS SO. YOU'VE HEARD

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:27.810
AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM- AS

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:28.977
WE WORKED OVER THE PAST FEW

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:31.180
YEARS. WE STARTED TO TRY TO

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:33.415
DEVELOP A MAP BECAUSE- JUST TO

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.017
ILLUSTRATE WHAT THIS MAZE IS

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:36.919
THAT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT COMING

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.754

FROM LEFT TO RIGHT WHAT WE'RE

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:44.493
TRYING TO SEE IS LIKE WHAT IS

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.494
THE CONTINUE M. FOR YOUNG

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:48.864
PEOPLE. AND AS THEY GET OLDER

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.632
AND IF YOU THIS MAZE IS

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.668
DIFFICULT FOR US TO SEE IF YOU

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.636
CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT MIGHT

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.605
BE FOR A FAMILY- OR AN

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.173
ADMINISTRATOR OF THESE PROGRAMS

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.808
AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS I WANT

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:02.077
TO CALL OUT HERE IS. WHEN YOU

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:03.846
LOOK AT AGES I MEAN RATES

01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:06.415
THERE'S REALLY A WIDE VARIETY OF

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:07.282
RATES- THOSE CHILDCARE IS

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:08.584
UNDERFUNDED THEY AT LEAST

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.486
ACCOUNT FOR REGIONAL DIFFERENCES

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:11.386
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:13.489
SEEN OR HEARD OF IT AFTER SCHOOL

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:17.092
FOR A WHILE- AND SO. ANY ONE OF

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:18.794
THESE ADMINISTRATORS MIGHT HAVE

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:20.529
TO TAKE ON ALL TEN OF THESE

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:21.797
PROGRAMS AND THE EXPECTED

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:24.500
EXPECTED TO BLEND IN BRAID- AND

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:27.569
AGAIN. RIGHT NOW. WE'RE NOT

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:29.071
ALWAYS ALLOWED TO BLEND IN

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.206
GREATER WORKFORCE FOR EXAMPLE

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:32.674
THE QUALIFICATIONS ARE DIFFERENT

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:33.842
SO WHY WE HAVE THESE HUGE

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:36.044
STAFFING CHALLENGES. SOME OF OUR

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:39.848
PROGRAM PROVIDERS ARE UNABLE TO

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.216
. EVEN MAKE SHORT TERM

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.185
SUBSTITUTION- BECAUSE OF SOME OF

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.453
THE PROGRAMMER FIVE MINUTES

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.355
AGAIN THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.457
PLACE FOR A REASON BUT WE MIGHT

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:49.925
NEED TO STEP BACK AND RETHINK

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:52.127
THINGS IF WE ARE ASKING FOLKS TO

01:13:52.194 --> 01:13:54.029
BLEND IN GRADE MORE AND MORE.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.430
YOU CAN ALSO SEE THAT THIS

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:57.299
VARIETY OF PROGRAMS ARE OVERSEEN

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:58.867
BY DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATING

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.903
AGENCIES AND SO WHEN YOU ADD A

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:02.704
LOT OF DIFFERENT. ADMINISTRATIVE

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.173
AGENCIES YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:06.275
THE BURDEN THAT CAN HAPPEN ON

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:08.177
PROVIDERS WHO AGAIN ARE TRYING

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.646
TO FOCUS ON THE WHOLE CHILD. THE

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:13.949
WHOLE FAMILY APPROACH- AND SO

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:14.883
AGAIN WHILE WE THINK BLENDING

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.819
AND BRAIDING SOUNDS GOOD AND IS

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:18.954
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT'S NOT

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:21.790
AS EASY AS WE MAKE IT SEEM SO WE

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:23.192
HOPE- AFTER THIS HEARING FOLKS

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:25.227
CAN I DID GET A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:26.895
TO THIS ROAD MAP AND THINK ABOUT

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:29.431
HOW DO WE REMOVE. AND BARRIERS-

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:30.999
AND SOME OF THE BLOCKS TO COME

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:33.235
IN THINKING MORE HOLISTICALLY SO

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.404
WITH THAT I'M GONNA PASS IT OFF

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:36.271
TO THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:37.406
CENTER TO CLOSE THIS OUT WITH

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:38.874
SOME HIGH LEVEL POLICY ISSUES

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.475
AND OPPORTUNITIES. THAT THE

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:42.344
COMMITTEE CAN CONSIDER THANK

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:44.079

POINT ABOUT IT'S HARD FOR US TO

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:53.755
LOOK AT AND FIGURE IT OUT HOW IN

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.123
THE WORLD IS APPARENT NAVIGATE

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:58.227

AND I AM THE CHIEF STRATEGY

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:08.370
OFFICER AT THE CHILD CARE

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:09.838
RESOURCE CENTER. THANK YOU SO

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:12.241
MUCH SENATOR FOR CONVENING THIS

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:15.577
pISSUE WE'VE ALL WORKED ON. FOR

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:18.313
THE PAST FEW YEARS AS JESSICA

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.349
MENTIONED. CCRC IS A NONPROFIT

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:22.117
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION AND

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:23.452
OUR MISSION IS TO CULTIVATE

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:24.887
CHILD FAMILY AND COMMUNITY

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:26.788
WELLBEING. WE ACHIEVE THESE

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.690
GOALS BY ADMINISTERING A VARIETY

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.792
OF STATE. FEDERAL AND LOCALLY

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:32.427
FUNDED PROGRAMS INCLUDING CHILD

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:34.229
CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL.

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.964
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT CAL WORKS

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:38.066
SUBSIDIES HEAD START AND A

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:39.935
VARIETY OF FAMILY RESOURCE AND

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:41.069
WELL BEING SERVICES INCLUDING

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.938
HOME VISITING MENTAL HEALTH

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:45.807
CONSULTATION AND RESOURCE. I WE

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:46.975
PROVIDE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.610
BIRTH OR- BIRTH THROUGH SCHOOL

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.379
AGE AND THAT WAS REALLY WHAT

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:52.114
BROUGHT US TO THE TABLE WITH P.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:55.417
C. Y. AS WE STARTED TO SEE. SO

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:57.152
MANY CHALLENGES EMERGING

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:58.754
CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE FULL

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:02.157
CONTINUUM. I'M WE ENTERED THIS

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.426
UP WITH EYES WIDE OPEN- WE KNEW

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:05.861
THIS WAS GOING TO BE A

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.896
COMPLICATED CONVERSATION. AND I

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:10.432
REALLY APPRECIATE THE LABELING

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.434
OF A PLANT THAT MIKE ERA.

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.403
BECAUSE I DO FEEL LIKE BOTH THE

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:15.737
CHILDCARE AND EARLY LEARNING

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:18.774
SLASH THE- SECTORS ARE SWIMMING

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:23.612
IN PLANNING RIGHT NOW. AND A LOT

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.881
OF UNKNOWNS AND SO I'M GOING TO

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:28.450
START OFF BY LOOKING UP SPECIFIC

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:29.318
PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:31.219
IDENTIFIED. AND THEN I'M GOING

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:32.854
TO MOVE INTO SOME POLICY ISSUES

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:35.123
AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE ON

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.925
THE ROAD A HAT. FIRST AND

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:39.161
FOREMOST I'M THERE ARE

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.629
SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:43.398
BURDENS PLACED ON BOTH- ELEAZAR

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:44.866
AND COMMUNITY BASED OPERATORS

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.501
WHO ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE THAT

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.704
GRAPHIC THAT YOU JUST LOOKED AT-

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.573
AND- CLEARLY WE'RE STRUGGLING TO

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.442
TRY TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.644
SEAMLESS SYSTEM TO PARENTS. BUT

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.446
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.948
RULES THAT WERE GIVEN. THEY

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:02.150
CREATE SYSTEMS WHICH WERE LIFTED

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:04.553
UP BY CARLOS NINOS WHERE YOU

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:06.588
HAVE KIDS WHO CAN ONLY BE IN ONE

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:07.889
PART OF THIS A PROGRAM BECAUSE

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.124
THE FUNDING THAT'S RECEIVED

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.492
THERE WERE SECTIONING KIDS OFF

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.661
FROM EACH OTHER- MAYBE TOGETHER

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.496
DURING SCHOOL DURING THE DAY.

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:16.231
AND THAT'S OFTEN HAPPENING BASED

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.733
ON THESOCIO ECONOMICS OF THEIR

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.235
FAMILY. I'M STUDENT SOME

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.670
PROVIDERS ARE TREATED AND

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:23.572
EQUALLY FOR COMPARABLE TYPES OF

01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:25.707
SERVICE DEPENDING ON THE DOOR

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:28.043
THEY ENTER. WE HAVE MAJOR

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.945
STAFFING SHORTAGES BOTH FOR

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.680
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION THAT

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:33.448
UNDERMINED THE ABILITY. TO

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:35.617
EXPAND ACCESS AND PROVIDE

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:37.085
PROFESSIONAL STABILITY TO OUR

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:39.054
WORKFORCE AND CONSISTENCY OF

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:41.990
CARE TO OUR KIDS. THE DUKE THERE

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:43.792
ARE DUPLICATIONS OF STATE LOCAL

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.160
ADMINISTRATIVE ROLES IN

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:47.029
SUFFICIENT AND DISCONNECTED DATA

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:49.231
TRACKING WE'RE NEVER TALKED

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:51.166
ABOUT IN THE SAME CONVERSATION.

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:52.901
SO WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO PIECE

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:54.903
IT TOGETHER AFTER THE FACT. WE

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:57.105
HAVE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.173
BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION NINETY

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.509
EIGHT. OUR PROPOSITION NINETY

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:02.177
EIGHT REALLY LIMITS WHAT ELEAZAR

01:18:02.244 --> 01:18:04.179
CAN DO HOW COMMUNITY BASED

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:06.448
PROVIDERS CAN BE INVOLVED AND

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.483
HOW WE CAN SHARE AND LEVERAGE

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.552
RESOURCES. AND I THINK

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.654
PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK AT

01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:15.424
UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND HOW

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:16.725
WE'RE GOING TO MAXIMIZE OUR

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.527
SYSTEMWE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.562
TACKLE THIS CONVERSATION IT'S A

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:23.432
PAINFUL CONVERSATION. I KNOW NO

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:25.434
ONE LIKES THE- STATION BUT IT IS

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.402
DEFINITELY THE ELEPHANT IN THE

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:32.507
ROOM. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:33.909
SYSTEMS. WE ALSO HAVE CAN IN

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.143
OVER TIMELINE AND REQUIREMENTS

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:37.846
TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES. WE HAVE-

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:39.648
CHALLENGES WHERE WE REALLY DO

01:18:39.714 --> 01:18:42.451
NEED TO OFFER A FULL WORK DAY

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:44.486
AND YEAR FOR WORKING PARENTS.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.089
AND WE'RE EXCITED THAT THE EARLY

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:48.690
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:50.492
IS STARTING TO LOOK AT NINE HOUR

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.828
DAYS AND STARTING TO LOOK AT NON

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:54.763
OPERATIONAL DAYS OF SCHOOL. BUT

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.565
IT HAS TO BE ALL OF THOSE DAYS

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:58.266
IT CAN'T JUST BE THIRTY

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.902
ADDITIONAL DAYS. I PERSONALLY

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:02.804
WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS IN-

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:05.273
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUMMER IS THE

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:07.476
HARDEST TIME FOR PARENTS WHO

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:09.377
HAVE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILD.

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:10.745
AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:12.547
CONSISTENT ENROLLMENT AT A CHILD

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:13.882
CARE PROGRAM AND THEY'RE TRYING

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:16.051
TO GO OUT AND FIND CAMP OPTIONS

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:17.552
OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IT'S

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:20.622
REALLY A CHALLENGE. AND LASTLY

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:22.157
IN THE PROBLEM SECTION THERE'S

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:23.892
BEEN A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S GONE

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.627
OUT TO LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:27.896
TO BE PART OF THIS PLAN. BUT

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:29.364
THERE HAS BEEN NO MONEY GIVEN TO

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:30.999
THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SYSTEM TO

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:32.667
THE CHILD CARE SECTOR OR TOO

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:34.970
EARLY EXPANDED LEARNING TO SIT

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:37.372
AT THOSE TABLES. AND I CAN ONLY

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.907
SPEAK FROM MY OWN ORGANIZATION

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:40.408
AND SAYING THAT WE HAVE OVER

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:41.476
FORTY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:43.378
IN OUR SERVICE AREA THAT'S A LOT

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:46.148
OF TABLES. AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:48.116
EFFECTIVELY PARTNER AND BE THERE

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:49.651
I'M IN A WAY THAT WE WANT TO

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:53.421
SHOW UP WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.689
SUPPORT. SO AS EVERYONE HAS

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.591
LIFTED UP WERE AT AN INCREDIBLE

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:58.593
OPPORTUNITY MOMENTS WHERE THEN

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.028
FLEXION POINT WHERE PEOPLE

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:02.364
REALLY DO UNDERSTAND. THAT

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:04.132
FAMILIES NEED THESE SERVICES

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:06.701
CHILDREN NEED THESE SERVICES AND

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.670
WE ALL HAVE TO ROLL OUR SLEEVES

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.238
UP. AND WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:12.774
MAKE THIS BETTER. SO SOME OF THE

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.843
AREAS WHERE WE KNOW THERE ARE

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:17.345
IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES- ARE.

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:18.880
CERTAINLY AROUND REIMBURSEMENT

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:21.917
RATES. I'M WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.585
LOOKING AT REIMBURSEMENT RATES

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.453
AND A VRIETY OF DIFFERENT TASK

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.757
FORCES AND WORKING GROUPS. NONE

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:31.126
OF THEM ARE LOOKING ACROSS THE

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:32.494
WHOLE CONTINUUM. EXPANDED

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:35.263
LEARNING IS LEFT OUT. THERE ARE

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:37.666
A DOLLARS NEEDED TO EXPAND THE

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:39.167
LEARNING BETTER AND ASK OF LOCAL

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:41.436
DISTRICTS TO BRING IN A MATCH.

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:42.904
AND WHAT YOU END UP AS WITH

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:44.973
TREMENDOUS INCONSISTENCIES ON

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.243
WHAT WE PAY FOR THE BIRTH OF

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:49.211
TWELVE CONTINUUM OF CARE. ONE OF

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:50.645
THE EXAMPLES THAT I WANTED TO

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:52.948
LIVE I HAVE IS FOR THE SAME AGE

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:56.218
CHILD SO A SCHOOL AGE CHILD A

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:58.954
TWO SECOND GRADER. IF THEY'RE IN

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.556
AN EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAM THE

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:03.692
REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS ABOUT TWO

01:21:03.758 --> 01:21:06.061
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IF

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:08.396
THEY'RE IN THE SAME. PART TIME

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:12.000
PROGRAM IN A CHILD CARE SYSTEM

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:14.569
THE STATE REIMBURSEMENTS CLOSER

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:15.670
TO TEN THOUSAND PER YEAR THAT'S

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:18.640
A HUGE GAP IT'S A HUGE GAP AND

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:19.841
IT CHANGES WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:22.277
OFFER. THE OTHER THING THAT WE

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.613
ARE REALLY WORKING THROUGH AND

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:26.681
WANT TO TALK TO POLICYMAKERS

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:30.185
ABOUT. IS HOW DO WE HANDLE THE

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:32.187
CONTINUUM OF CARE PARTICULARLY

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.989
AROUND UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:36.124
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THE

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:38.326
NEEDS OF YOUNG ELEMENTARY

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:40.528
STUDENTS AND TK'S STUDENTS ARE

01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:44.799
NOT. NECESSARILY A GOOD FIT FOR

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:45.967
WHAT OUR TRADITIONAL AFTER

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:48.069
SCHOOL MODEL HAS BEEN WITH

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:50.572
HIGHER STAFFING RATIOS- THEY ARE

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.906
NOT OLDER ELEMENTARY KIDS

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.375
THEY'RE NOT SELF DIRECTED THERE

01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:56.044
NOT AT AN AGE WHERE THEY CAN DO

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.145
THINGS INDEPENDENTLY. HOW ARE WE

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:58.680
GOING TO SET UP AN AGE

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.682
APPROPRIATE SYSTEM WHERE THOSE

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.117
CHILDREN RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:06.288
SUPERVISION AND CARE AND ARE IN

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:06.921
A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AFTER SCHOOL.

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:09.257
WE ALSO NEED TO INCLUDE. A NEW

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:10.692
VISION FOR BUILDING THE WORK

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.794
FORCE A LOT OF THIS IS REALLY

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:14.863
HINGES ON HOW MUCH WE PAY PEOPLE

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.498
IF WE DON'T PAY PEOPLE A

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:19.000
REASONABLE WAGE. LET ALONE A

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:21.569
LIVING WAGE- WE CAN'T RECRUIT

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.238
PEOPLE INTO THIS INDUSTRY AND WE

01:22:23.305 --> 01:22:25.206
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. SO I THINK

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:26.574
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:28.643
WE REALLY THINK ABOUT. THE

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:30.478
WORKFORCE WERE BRINGING AND HOW

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:32.480
WE IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:34.249
INTEREST IN INTENTIONALITY AND

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:35.750
SKILLS IN WORKING WITH YOUNG

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:38.486
CHILDREN. AND HOW WE INCLUDE

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:40.021
THEM IN WHATEVER SYSTEM IT IS

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:44.292
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD. WE ARE-

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.528
LOOKING AT THE MASTER PLANNED

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:47.796
FOR EARLY LEARNING AND MANY OF

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:49.864
US HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:50.465
CONTINUING EFFORT WE'RE

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:52.200
DISAPPOINTED THAT EXPANDED

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:54.336
LEARNING WAS NOT INCLUDED. IT'S

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:56.004
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE'RE

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.505
LOOKING AT THIS WE LOOK AT THE

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:58.807
WHOLE SYSTEM AND THE WHOLE

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:00.909
CONTINUUM OF CARE BECAUSE IF YOU

01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:02.944
MAKE CHANGES ONLY ONE AGE GROUP.

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:05.580
OR IN ONLY ONE PROGRAM THERE ARE

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:06.881
RIPPLE EFFECTS THAT ARE FELT

01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:10.318
OUT. AND TO MAKE CHANGES AND

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:13.388
IGNORE THAT- IS SURE IT IT

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:16.024
LEAVES US COMING UP SHORT ALL OF

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:17.759
THE TIME. WE REALLY ENCOURAGE

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:19.027
THAT THERE BE POLICIES

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:21.129
CONSIDERED TO REQUIRE INSTEAD OF

01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:22.564
INCENTIVIZE DATA SHARING

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.065
TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:26.868
COLLABORATIVE MESSAGING- WE LIVE

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:29.904
ACROSS TWO STATE AGENCIES.

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.973
ALWAYS HAVE MY GUESS IS ALWAYS

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.577
WELL AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:37.512
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO DO

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:41.616
THAT. AND I'M- YOU KNOW I'VE

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.351
BEEN STUDYING THIS FOR A LONG

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:46.488
TIME AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:48.323
IMAGINE IF YOUR FAMILY AND

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:49.290
YOU'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:56.731
NAVIGATE. SO IF THE OTHER AREAS

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:59.134
FOR POTENTIAL- ASSISTANCE WOULD

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.802
BE TO CONSIDER MORE ONE TIME

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:03.538
FUNDS. AND GOINGDIRECTLY TO

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:05.707
CEOS TO HELP THEM BE AT THESE

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:08.042
TABLES AND BUILD OUT THESE

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:10.578
PROGRAMS. AND LOOK AT PROTECTING

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:12.614
FUNDING TO ALLOW IT TO ROLL OVER

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.048
AND EXTENDABLE IMITATION

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.850
TIMELINE. I THINK OU HEARD FROM

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:18.286
ALL OF OUR SERVICE OPERATORS

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:19.454
THERE UNDER THE GUISE. AND THEY

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:20.789
NEED MORE TIME AND MORE

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:24.459
EXPERTISE. AND WE NEED TO GIVE

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:26.027
THEM THE TIME TO DO THAT. AND

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.529
LASTLY DURING THIS OVERWHELMING

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:30.031
AND EXCITING EXPANSION OF T. K.

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:34.502
THE STATE. DO SOME WORK TO

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:35.804
CREATE HIGH LET'S. WITH THE

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:38.473
SUBSET OF ELEAZAR CBO'S AND CO

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:41.176
EASE- THAT WOULD INCREASE

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:42.911
FLEXIBILITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:46.214
REQUIREMENTS SO WE CAN TEST OUT

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:46.948
WHAT MIGHT WORK- YOU HAVE

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.416
ENGAGED OPERATORS YOU HEARD FROM

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:50.618
MANY OF THEM HERE TODAY WHO

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:52.754
WOULD BE WILLING TO TRY THINGS.

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:54.055
WE CAN LOOK AT REMOVAL OF

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:56.257
CERTAIN STAFFING REQUIREMENTS TO

01:24:56.324 --> 01:24:57.492
SEE WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT MIGHT

01:24:57.559 --> 01:25:00.762
MAKE HOW COULD WE LOOK AT THE-

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:02.630
REQUIREMENTS FOR C. C. T. ARE

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:04.566
THE CENTER BASED PROGRAMS AND

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:06.401
THEIR FACILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:09.003
WOULD MAKE IT APPROPRIATE FOR

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:11.039
ALL THESE AGES. WE NEED TO ALLOW

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:13.541
PROGRAMS TO GROUP BY AGE NOT BY

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:16.077
FUNDING STREAMS WE CAN TRY THAT

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:18.880
OUT. AND WE NEED TO CREATE

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:21.816
INCENTIVES FOR L. E. A. N. C. B.

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:23.818
O. PARTNERSHIPS TO MAXIMISE

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:25.920
EQUITY AND LIFT UP THE WHOLE

01:25:25.987 --> 01:25:28.022

THINKING THAT WENT INTO THE

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:32.460
STEERING AND THE TREMENDOUS

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:35.630

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:21.342
PRESENTATIONS WE HEARD TODAY AND

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:22.877
I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF- SYSTEMS

01:26:22.944 --> 01:26:24.712
ISSUES AND ORGANIZATIONAL

01:26:24.779 --> 01:26:27.549
ISSUES. BUT I DID WANT TO ASK A

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:29.417
QUESTION I THINK- HONEST MERRIER

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:31.386
TOUCHED A BIT ON THIS IT IS A

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:34.422
DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN AND-

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:35.890
FATHER. WHEN THINGS IS WE'RE

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:38.026
ROLLING OUT OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:40.228
EDUCATION PROGRAM IS TO

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:42.964
RECOGNIZE THAT- THE FOCUS OF

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.399
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS A

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:46.668
BIT DIFFERENT- FOR TO BE

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:48.469
EFFECTIVE COMPARED TO WHAT WE

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:49.871
NEED FOCUS LET'S SAY AN OLDER

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:51.472
CHILDREN'S SCHOOL AS ELEMENTARY

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:54.075
SCHOOL KIDS- THE RESEARCH ON

01:26:54.142 --> 01:26:56.311
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. HAS

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:57.445
SHOWN THAT OF COURSE HAS A

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:59.047
TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE FUTURE

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:01.482
DEVELOPMENT BUT THAT IMPACT IS

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:02.750
ACTUALLY NOT THE FOCUS ON

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:06.321
ACADEMICS IT'S A FOCUS ON.

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:07.722
ESSENTIALLY SOCIALIZATION. N.

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:08.990
FACTORS SOME MORE RECENT

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.526
RESEARCH SHOWING THAT- PROGRAMS

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:12.794
HAVE BEEN MORE FOCUSED ON

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:14.829
ACADEMICS EARLY ON ACTUALLY ARE

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.898
NOT HAVING THE LONG TERM RESULTS

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:17.932
THAT WE SAW WITH THE OTHER

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:20.101
RESEARCH THAT- THE PRESCHOOL

01:27:20.168 --> 01:27:22.070
PROGRAMS. SO YES MY QUESTION

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:23.905
REALLY IS THAT AND I KNOW

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:25.473
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:26.608
AND I ALSO HEARD FROM THE FOLKS

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:27.809
SAYING LIKE WE'RE TRANSPLANTED

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:29.444
UP THESE PROGRAMS VERY QUICKLY

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:32.280
AND SO FORTH. IS THAT HOW DO WE

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:34.682
ENSURE THAT. THE FOCUS OF THESE

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:36.618
PROGRAMS ARE DOING T. K. AND-

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:38.086
YOU KNOW ALL THESE OTHER THINGS

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:42.056
THAT IS ACTUALLY- THAT THE

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:43.458
PROGRAMS THEMSELVES ARE

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:46.127
PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON-

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:48.997
SOCIALIZATION LET ME JUST GIVE

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:50.632
YOU ONE EXAMPLE IS AGAIN TALKING

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:52.767
ABOUT THE MORE RECENT RESEARCH.

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:54.369
IT WAS FASCINATING ABOUT IT WAS

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:55.737
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS HE

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:57.438
POINTED OUT WAS THAT IF THE

01:27:57.505 --> 01:27:59.774
BATHROOMS ARE TOO FAR AWAY. AND

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:01.509
THE TEACHERS HAVE TO GROUP THE

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:03.778
KIDS TO GET THEM TO THE BATHROOM

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:04.946
AND STUFF WHAT MAKES THEM STAND

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:07.248
IN LINE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:08.750
BIG ISSUE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.485
THIS OVER REGIMENTATION THAT

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:12.153
COULD HAPPEN. JUST BECAUSE OF

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.089
THE STRUCTURAL WAY THE- THE

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:17.358
STRUCTURAL. LAYOUT OF THE

01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:19.460
FACILITY. ACTUALLY YOU COULD

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:21.462
HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT OR TAKE

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:23.498
AWAY THE POSITIVE EFFECTOF.

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:26.467
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. SO I

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:28.002
KNOW IT'S ALREADY COMPLICATED

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:29.704
ENOUGH AS IT IS NOW I'M TALKING

01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:30.838
ABOUT WELL HOW DO YOU LAY OUT

01:28:30.905 --> 01:28:32.707
YOUR FACILITIES HOW DO YOU TRAIN

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:34.542
YOUR TEACHERS BUT I DO WANNA BE

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:35.643
SURE THAT. WE ARE GETTING THE

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:37.412
MOST FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.546
WE ARE HAVING THE POSITIVE.

01:28:38.613 --> 01:28:41.082
OUTCOMES THAT WE'VE THAT THE

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:43.418
PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN SO-

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:45.086
I'M NOT SURE WHO TO DIRECT A

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:48.656
QUESTION TO THE HEAD- YEAH I

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:50.692
DIDN'T. I GUESS I DIDN'T WANT TO

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:52.627
HEAR ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:28:52.694 --> 01:28:53.828
INSURERS WERE YOU KNOW SPENDING

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:56.197
ON BASS MEANT THAT WE ARE

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:57.498
STRUCTURING THE PROGRAMS IN A

01:28:57.565 --> 01:29:00.034
WAY. THAT HAS THE BEST BENEFIT

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:02.136
FOR THE KIDS THAT WERE ROLLING.

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:03.304
THANK YOU SENATOR PENN WE'LL

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:04.772
START WITH MRS NARINDER AND IF

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:06.541
THERE'S ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:09.077
JUMP IN PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND.

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:10.578
PLEASE GO AHEAD ON. I THINK

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:12.880
THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR PAN

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:13.881
FOR A LIFTING UP ONE OF THE

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:16.184
THINGS I SPEND A LOT OF NIGHTS A

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:18.786
WEEK AND THINKING ABOUT. I WE

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:21.989
ARE. ALSO LOOKING VERY CLOSELY

01:29:22.056 --> 01:29:23.825
AT THE RECENT RESEARCH THAT CAME

01:29:23.891 --> 01:29:26.360
OUT ABOUT THE IMPACTS THE

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:29.063
UNINTENDED IMPACTS OF EARLY

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:29.597
ACADEMICS INCLUDING YOUNG

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:31.032
CHILDREN IN SETTINGS THAT WORKED

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:33.534
JUST FINE FOR THEM. AND I THINK

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:35.436
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:38.639
BEEN OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME IS

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:41.976
HOW DO WE- CREATE EARLY LEARNING

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.644
AND EXPANDED WORKING

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:45.613
ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:48.049
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE. AND

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:50.318
DO ALL THE THINGS WE KNOW YOUNG

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:54.822
KIDS NEED- YOU KNOW I MADE MY

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:57.391
COLLEAGUES WILL LAUGH AT ME BUT

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.260
FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN THEY NEED

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:02.230
NAPS THEY NEED SNACKS THEY NEED

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:03.998
SOMEBODY TO CARE FOR THEM AND

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:06.768
THEY NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:08.836
TO YOU KNOW PICK THEM UP IF THEY

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:09.937
STUMBLE. AND PROVIDE THEM WITH

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:11.873
THE WARMTH AND CARING THAT IS

01:30:11.939 --> 01:30:13.741
GOING TO HELP THEM GROW AND

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:14.776
DEVELOP AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE

01:30:14.842 --> 01:30:17.812
SOCIAL SKILLS AND I THINK THAT

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:21.282
WE HAVE- A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:22.784
THINK ABOUT OUR APPROACH TO

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:25.219
PRESCHOOL AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:27.421
WE ARE NOT GOING DOWN THE ROAD

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:29.791
OF PUTTING TOO MANY ACADEMICS IN

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:31.592
FRONT OF THESE CHILDREN TOO SOON

01:30:31.659 --> 01:30:34.028
AND BURNING THEM OUT. AND I ALSO

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:36.497
WAS ALARMED BY THE SIMPLE THING

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:38.332
OF BATHROOMS LIGHT I HAVE TALKED

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:39.934
ABOUT TINY TOILET SO MUCH IN THE

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:42.136
PAST TEN YEARS I CAN'T EVEN

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:44.872
BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH- BUT

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.407
IT DOES MATTER IT TEACHES

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:51.012
CHILDREN SELF REGULATION TEACHES

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:51.646
CHILDREN HOW TO MANAGE THEIR OWN

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:53.681
BODY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:55.283
MOST CONCERNS ME IS. WE'RE

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:56.484
MOVING MORE AND MORE YOUNG

01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:58.419
CHILDREN INTO SETTINGS AND

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.454
PROGRAMS THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR

01:31:00.521 --> 01:31:03.591
THAT. AND WE NEED TO HOLD UP

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:05.560
INVESTIGATORS AND LIFT UP THE

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:07.461
SPACES THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR

01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:08.763
THEM AND EXPAND THOSE

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:10.998
OPPORTUNITIES. AND IT IS CLEARLY

01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:12.533
PART OF THIS CONTINUE- AND I

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.670
THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR RAISING

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:16.871
THE THING THAT'S BEEN KEEPING ME

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:18.472
UP AT NIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:21.175
MISS NEAR INJURE AND WE ALSO

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.443
HAVE MISS CAPONE WHO WOULD LIKE

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:23.411
TO COMMENT PLEASE PROCEED WHEN

01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:25.713
YOU'RE READY- THANKYOU SO MUCH

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:28.082
FOR ASKING THE- THE QUESTION AND

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:29.650
DONNA I SO APPRECIATE YOUR

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:32.119
ANSWER- I THINK FOR TOO LONG

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:34.956
WE'VE ASKED. HOW DO WE PREPARE

01:31:35.022 --> 01:31:37.358
SCHOOLS OUR CHILDREN TO BE READY

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:38.926
FOR SCHOOLS RATHER THAN ASKING

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:40.695
THE QUESTION OF HOW DO WE

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:43.030
PREPARE SCHOOLS TO BE READY. TO

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:43.764
RECEIVE THE CHILDREN WHO ARE

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:46.200
JOINING THEM- AS AN EARLY

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:48.636
EDUCATOR- I'VE BEEN AT THIS A

01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:50.771
VERY LONG TIME AND- I'VE READ A

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:52.573
LOT OF RESEARCH AND ONE OF THE

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.208
THINGS THAT STICKS WITH ME

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:56.911
CONSISTENTLY. IS THE WORK OF A

01:31:56.978 --> 01:31:58.512
CAUGHT SKI WHO SAYS THERE IS

01:31:58.579 --> 01:32:01.582
NOTHING THAT WE LEARN OUTSIDE OF

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.351
THE CONTEXT OF A RELATIONSHIP.

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:05.720
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. EVEN

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:08.256
THE CONCEPT OF MORE CHILDREN

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:10.892
LEARN MORE WHEN THE CHILD BESIDE

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:14.896
THEM GETS MORE JUICE FIRST SNACK

01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:16.197
VENDING. ALL OF OUR LEARNING

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:17.465
COMES IN THE SOCIAL

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:19.667
RELATIONSHIPS AND IF CHILDREN

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.702
AREN'T SUPPORTED TO DEVELOP

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:23.938
CLOSE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. THAT

01:32:24.005 --> 01:32:26.307
MAY LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:29.710
LEARN WE HAVE OTHERS- JUST LIKE

01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:32.280
WE FOCUS SO MUCH ENERGY ON WHAT

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:34.482
IS THE MATH SKILLS A CHILD NEEDS

01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:36.217
TO LEARN WHAT IS THE LANGUAGE

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:37.885
SKILL IT CHILD NEEDS TO LEARN.

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:40.187
LEARNING SOCIAL SKILLS DON'T

01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:42.990
HAPPEN BY CHANCE LEARNING HOW TO

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:45.192
BE PART OF THIS GROUP DOESN'T

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:47.962
HAPPEN BY CHANCE. LEARNING HOW

01:32:48.029 --> 01:32:50.731
TO TAKE TURNS DOESN'T HAPPEN BY

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:54.835
CHANCE IT IS DIFFICULT WORK THAT

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:58.839
TAKES PLACE IN NURTURING

01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:01.742
ENVIRONMENTS WHO'S- TASK IS TO

01:33:01.809 --> 01:33:04.478
ME EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN

01:33:04.545 --> 01:33:07.081
SO THEY BECOME INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:08.849
ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.751
EMOTIONAL WORLD THAT SURROUNDS

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:12.820
THEM. BECAUSE IT IS NOT

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:14.655
EMOTIONAL WORLD THAT IS GOING TO

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:15.923
PROVIDE THE CONTEXT FOR

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:19.460
CURIOSITY AND INVESTIGATION. ON

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:22.129
AND I THINK THAT- WE HAVE TO

01:33:22.196 --> 01:33:24.532
STOP ASKING ON DOES YOUR CHILD

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:25.766
KNOW THEIR LETTERS DOES THEY NOT

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:27.668
DO THEY KNOW THEIR NUMBERS THEY

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:29.070
WILL LEARN THEIR LETTERS AND

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:30.604
NUMBERS WHEN IT BECOMES

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:33.507
IMPORTANT TO THEM WITH IN A

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:36.677
SOCIAL CONTEXT. KIDS WANT TO

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:38.846
KNOW THEIR FRIENDS NAMES AND I

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:41.349
FOCUSED ON SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:42.817
CHILD NAMES THEY'RE GOING TO

01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:45.052
LEARN THAT DONNA'S NAME STARTS

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:48.055
WITH D. AND I'M GONNA BE EXCITED

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:50.091
ABOUT THAT NOT BECAUSE OF THE

01:33:50.157 --> 01:33:52.727
LETTER D. BUT BECAUSE DONNA IS

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:56.030
MY FRIEND. AND SHE HER NAME IS

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:58.499
PART OF WHO SHE IS. THE OTHER

01:33:58.566 --> 01:34:00.301
THING OUT JUST SAYING CLOSING

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:01.635
THIS MY BUTTON I COULD GO ON FOR

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:03.904
EVER BUT ONE OF THE THINGS ONE

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:06.407
WEEK KNOWLEDGE THE SOCIAL GROWTH

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:08.509
THAT OCCURS IN THE EARLY YEARS

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:10.578
IS WE BEGIN TO TEACH CHILDREN

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:13.080
THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT. THEY

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:15.282
HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY AND THEY

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:18.152
ARE WORTH LISTENING TO. AND THAT

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:19.954
IS SOMETHING THAT IF YOU LOSE

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:22.323
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT FOR

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:23.891
CHILDREN TO SEE THEMSELVES AS

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:28.896
POTENT. IN THIS WORLD. IN THE

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:31.298
EARLY. IT IS X. DIFFICULT FOR

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:34.101
THEM TO MAKE IT UP LATER. SO

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:37.004
SOCIAL SKILLS ARE THE JOB THE

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:38.906
WORK OF EARLY CHILDHOOD AND IT

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:41.475
IS A JOYFUL WORK. AS OPPOSED TO

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:42.810
IN THE MIDDLE WHERE NESS WHICH

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:45.379
NOT SO MUCH. ON SEPT THANK YOU

01:34:45.446 --> 01:34:47.114
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY

01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:49.383
OPINION. THANK YOU MS CAPONE A

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:51.552
VERY VERY GOOD WORDS SENATOR PAT

IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YET. I

01:34:53.421 --> 01:34:55.856
FIRST I JUST WANT TO REALLY

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:59.226
THINK. ABOUT IT THE ANSWERS- YET

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:00.428
AS A DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:02.263
I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE RESEARCH

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:04.799
IS CLEAR- THAT. IS THEY BOTH

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:07.368
MENTIONED- SELF REGULATION

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:08.803
SOCIALIZATION AND THEY'RE

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:12.840
THEY'RE CRITICAL. PERIODS OF

01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:13.974
DEVELOPMENT THAT AND- THAT. KNOW

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:15.676
THAT THAT PRESCHOOL AGE IT'S IT

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:16.644
REALLY IS OUT SOCIAL

01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:18.913
SOCIALIZATION AND IN FACT IT HAS

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:21.148
A VERY LONG TERM IMPACTS IN

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:22.817
TERMS OF ABILITY YOU KNOW TO.

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.418
WENT WITH KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:25.920
AND BE ABLE TO GRADUATE HIGH

01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:27.354
SCHOOL AND- THEIR CHANCES OF

01:35:27.421 --> 01:35:28.656
GETTING A JOB LATER ON AND SO

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:31.525
FORTH. AND SO I JUST HOPE THAT
