WE'RE GONNA CONVENE AS A SUB COMMITTEE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. AND THEN WE'LL -- WE'LL HEAR BILLS AS A SUB. AND THEN WAIT TILL WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM TO TAKE OUR VOTES BUT WE DO HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD WITH US. WELCOME MEMBERS. DO YOU CARE TO PRESENT. GOOD MORNING. SO WE'RE GONNA GO A LITTLE OUT OF ORDER THIS MORNING AND WILL START. FOR THOSE PAYING ATTENTION IT'S WELL ACTUALLY SORRY FILE ITEM ONE A. B. THIRTY WE'RE NOT AT WORK SO. MIKE IS YOUR SERVICE. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND ME AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TUBS FIRE STARTED IN CALISTOGA. A LITTLE UNDER FOUR HOURS AS WELL -- TWELVE MILES THROUGH CINEMA COUNTY IN INTO THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. DURING THAT TIME OF FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED. AND THAT AND TOOK THE LIVES OF TWENTY TWO PEOPLE NEARLY ALL OF THEM WERE FROM COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. AT THAT TIME WE KIND OF FELT LIKE THIS WAS A WE WERE EXPERIENCED A ONCE IN A LIFETIME TRAGEDY BUT SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD THE THOMAS FIRE THE WILL THE FIRE THE CAR FIRE THE WHICH FIRE CAMPFIRE -- AND AND WE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR AND SO SADLY WE'VE BEEN PROVEN WRONG. WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ARE PART OF THE NEW ABNORMAL. AND WE'RE STARTING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS. LAST YEAR IN SB NINE A ONE WE COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO HELP IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR FORESTS AND WILD LANDS WHICH IS CRITICAL TO THE BIGGER -- CLIMTE CHANGE PICTURE I'M FORTUNE WE HAVE OVER TWO MILLION HOMES ALREADY BUILT IN HIGH OR OR VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNS AND HE'S COMMUNITIES ARE IN IMMINENT DANGER. CURRENT BUILDING CODES REQUIRE NEW CONSTRUCTION TO UTILIZE MATERIALS LANDSCAPING AND DESIGNS THAT HELP PREVENT WINDBLOWN EMBERS FROM IGNITING THE BUILDINGS AND SPREADING THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS HOWEVER THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOMES WERE BUILT LAW. THE THE LONG BEFORE THESE BILL BILLING CODES WENT INTO PLACE. AB THIRTY EIGHT IS OUR ATTEMPT TO BEGIN ADDRESSING THE HUGE CHALLENGING REPAIRING THIS OLDER BUILT ENVIRONMENT FOR THE FIRES -- OF THE NEW CLIMATE CHANGE ERA. IN THIS BILL WE'RE PROPOSING A TWO PRONGED APPROACH FIRST FOR PROPOSING A REBATE OR NO LOW NO OR NO LOW INTEREST LOAN INTEREST REVOLVING LOAN FOG FIND. THE PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES FOR HOMEOWNERS TO RETROFIT HOMES IN HIGH FIRE SEVERITY A HIGHER HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNS. THE FUND WOULD BE OPERATED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY SECOND WE WE ARE REQUIRING HOMEOWNERS IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARDS INSTANCES A SEVERITY ZONES. DISCLOSE WHICH FIRE HARDING RETROFITS ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT THE HOME FROM WINDBLOWN EMBERS. AND AND TO PROVDE PROOF OF SIX OF A SUCCESSFUL DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION WHEN THE HOME IS SO. THE WORKING CLOSE WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ENSURE THESE REQUIREMENTS DO NOT HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF PREVENTING HOMERS FROM SELLING THEIR HOMES. I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT BEFORE THE HOUSE THE BILL REACHES THE FLOOR I WILL FIND A BALANCE TO CREATE THE FLEXIBILITY FOR WOULD BE HOME SELLERS. AND INCREASE THAT THAT INCREASES THE INSPECTION A RETROFIT RATES OF HOMES IN DANGER OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IS THIS NOT A SILVER BULLET -- IS TAKEN AS GENERATIONS TO GET INTO THE SITUATION IT WILL TAKE US YEARS TO GET OUT OF IT BUT I BELIEVE AB THIRTY EIGHT MOVES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE EARLY ENGAGEMENT AND WORK ON THIS BILL I ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LOSE FORSBERG WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY [inaudible] TWENTY WELCOME THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ FORCED BURKE AND I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. DID YOU CONSERVANCY IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE FIRE ADOPTED COMMUNITIES LEARNING NETWORK A NATIONAL GROUP WORKING TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE CAPACITY IN FIRE PRONE COMMUNITIES. AND WE ARE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTY EIGHT CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE THE WORST WILDFIRES IN HISTORY SETTING NEW RECORDS FOR THE LARGEST AND MOST DESRUCTIVE. AND THE FACE OF MAKE A FIRES WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO INVEST IN AND CREATE FIRE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. BUT WE CAN'T STOP THIS PROBLEM OVERNIGHT THERE ARE TWO THINGS WE NEED TO INVEST IMMEDIATELY TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND NATURE IN THE FACE OF WILDFIRE. FORCED RESTORATION AND AGAIN FIRE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA MADE A ONE BILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT TO FOREST HEALTH AND FEELS REDUCTION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. NEED A COMPATIBLE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY PROTECTION TO ADOPT OUR HOMES TO DEAL WITH THE ESCALATING THREAT OF FIRES. THE FIRE HARDENED HOMES REVOLVING LOAN FUND CREATING AB THIRTY EIGHT WILL HELP US REACH THIS GOAL BY PROVIDING RESOURCES TO HOMEOWNERS TO RETROFIT HOMES FOR FIRE. IN ADDITION AB THIRTY EIGHT ONCE OR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH FIRE RESILIENCY AND SAFETY. THE BILL WILL IDENTIFY WHICH COUNTIES NEED MORE RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO IMPROVE FIRE SAFETY AND A DOCTOR COMMUNITIES TO DEAL WITH. THE NEW THREATS OF FIRE WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TO HAVE OTHERS HERE IN SUPPORT. THIS IS YOUR NUMBERS SO ELEVEN SALAS I'VE BEEN ASKED TO REGISTER FOR SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS. GOOD MORNING NOT YOUR MOM ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THE BARN WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. TINO OTHERS I DO HAVE ANY OPPOSITION. MORNING MORNING MR CHAIR MEMBERS OF MAYBE ANNA BACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. I'M AS WRITTEN -- CA ARE HAS AN OPPOSING UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL HOWEVER WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING IN COMING IN OR IF YOU JUST PULL THE MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER IT'S IT'S LOUD IN THE HALL. SERVICE ANYWAY. AS WRITTEN WAS THE A. R. HAS AN OPPOSE I'M UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING. IN VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND HIS STAFF AND WE CERTAINLY. CS GETTING TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN ALL AGREE I'M WE CERTAINLY AGREE ON THE CONCEPT IN THIS BILL IT'S JUST GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE -- WE CAN MAKE TRANSACTIONS VIABLE. VERY GOOD YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INPUT -- DO WE HAVE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS. SENATOR JACKSON'S. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS SIDE LIKE TO SAY GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE SO PRESUMPTUOUS. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THE FIRES UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COURSE I PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED THE THOMAS FIRE -- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DURING DECEMBER AND IN THE SANTA BARBARA VENTER AREA WHICH REALLY -- WAS QUITE A I THINK A LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF OF A FIRE THAT BURNED FOR FORTY DAYS -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S CLEAR THAT WE HAVE GOT TO START HARDENING OUR HOMES IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID IT'S THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM YEARS IN THE MAKING. WE CANNOT DE MINIMIZE. I'M A CHANGE AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ALL THIS AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO SEE US SAID TO SEE OUR NATIONAL LEADERSHIP. ROLLING IT BACKWARDS. BUT IN THE PROCESS. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD AND I I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED. THE IMPORTANCE OF MITIGATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION -- WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE BAIL OUT UTILITIES AND WHAT WE DO TO PROTECT THEIR BOTTOM LINE THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BOTTOM LINE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR OUR PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS THE MITIGATION AND PREVENTION. AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WILL COME ON BOARD BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE HOMES TO SELL. OR TO BUILD FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THEY BURN DOWN YOUR IN A HIGH RISK ZONE INSURANCE COMPANIES WON'T INSURE. MORTGAGE COMPANIES WON'T GIVE MORTGAGES -- THEN WE ARE IN OVER A REAL KEEP THE TROUBLE SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUSING ON THE MITIGATION AND PREVENTION PART OF THIS BATTLE OF THE HOME HARDENING OF FUND IS A GREAT IDEA I DID A BILL LAST YEAR THAT -- PROVIDED PACE MONEY AND WE KNOW THAT THAT PROGRAM ISN'T THE PANACEA -- BUT I THINK THIS IS A A WONDERFUL BILL AND IN FACT IF IF THERE IS ANY OPPORTUNITY TO AMENDED I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK. WE SHOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. AMENDMENTS COMING IN TODAY SO THEIR MONEY. THANK YOU ICE ALSO ONE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I KNOW WHERE THE POLICY COMMITTEE BUT JUST QUICKLY HOW DO YOU CONTEMPLATE. FUNDING THIS [inaudible] FUND. WELL WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT QUITE FRANKLY AND WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T LANDED ON THAT UNFORTUNATELY. THE IDEA WE HAD -- HASN'T WORKED TO PAN OUT WE BELIEVE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT AND AND WE WILL BRING IT UP ON WHO WE WILL BRING IT UP ON THE SENATE FLOOR UNTIL WE CAN SEE. IF WE GET OUT OF HERE WELL BECAUSE ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS IF YOU HAVE. A HOME SELLER. WHO IS TRYING TO DOWNSIZE OR SELL A HOME? IN THEY DON'T MEET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS HERE. DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. OTHER THAN TAKING A LOAN OUT ON THEIR HOME OR SOMEHOW INCOME RINGER DELAYING THE SALE. WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THE PUBLIC SAFETY OBJECTIVE THAT SAME HERE -- BUT I'M ALSO JUST SAYING Là THE SUPPORT OF TODAY BUT I WANT TO FOLLOW HOW. SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW A FAMILY THAT IS REQUIRED TO UPGRADE. IT DOESN'T HAVE THE MEANS. IN THEIR OWN BUDGET TO DO IT. THIS CONTEMPLATES THERE IS A FUND. AVAILABLE IS THAT FOR A LOAN SIR IS THAT OUTRIGHT GRANTS WE WOULD ENVISION IT AS LOW INTEREST LOANS OR OUTRIGHT GRANTS REGIONALLY -- WE WANTED TO REQUIRE THE RETROFITS NOW WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS IN THE EVENT THAT A HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET SO. THAT. THAT THE SELLER DISCLOSE WHAT RETROFITS HAVE BEEN DONE SO THAT THE BUYER KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE BUYING. AND AND THAT THEY'VE HAD ALSO A AND X. A AND A A AN INSPECTION. AROUND THE PROPERTY AS WELL SO THAT THE ONCE AGAIN THE BUYER KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE BUYING A REQUIRES DISCLOSURE BUT IT WOULDN'T PREVENT SCO SO LONG AS THE DISCLOSURES BEEN MADE. CORRECT -- BUT WE AND PART OF THAT BUT IS ALSO THE DISCLOSURE IF THE DISCLOSURES BEEN DONE AS IT DOES NOT PROVIDE PREVENT THE SALE WE JUST WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW RIGHT AND THEN YOU MIGHT NEGOTIATE BETWEEN SELLER AND BUYER. IT BUT THERE'S NO MANDATE TAX RIGHT TO THE UPGRADE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WHO RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO DO THE UPGRADES WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM OUT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS. AND THE BILL HAS CHANGED YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY I WANTED I REALLY DID. THINK THAT MAYBE THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS WAS TO MANDATE THIS AND AND AND WE FOUND OUT WAS PART THERE'S NO THE RESOURCES ARE CHALLENGE AND SO ON BUT FOR ME ANOTHER COMPONENT IT GOES BACK TO WHAT CENTER JACKSON WAS TALKING ABOUT IS PREVENTION. THESE THESE RETROFITS ARE CRITICAL TO PREVENTION BUT ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL THING SECOND TO THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT IS A DEFENSIBLE SPACE PART OF THAT. WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE THAT THAT. WE PROTECT IT AS MUCH ASWE CAN AROUND THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. OF COMPONENT OF THIS BILL AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING ON ROTH APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU -- AND I APPRECIATE. ALLOWING TO YOU TO ME TO BE THE PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR HERE AT AND THAT ON AND I WAS TREMENDOUSLY FRUSTRATED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO SEE. ALL OF OUR RESILIENCE FUNDING GUIDED -- THE SENATE PUSHED OUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LONG TERM RESILIENCE FUN THAT I THINK THIS COULD HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN A CANDIDATE -- FOR I THINK WE APPROPRIATED ABOUT A A BILLION OR SO TO CAL FIRE THAT STILL MAY BE A VIABLE PATHWAY BUT BETWEEN SB ONE EIGHTY TWO WHICH IS SENATOR JACKSON'S FRAME WORK ON ON LAND USE AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND FRIEDMAN AS A BILL COMING UP TODAY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHICH ALSO. IS IMPORTANT PIECE THAT PUZZLE AND DIED AS A FEW MEASURES. WE'VE GOT TO PUT A PREVENTION PACKAGE TOGETHER I THINK ON A BI CAMERA WILL BASIS AND I THINK THIS IS. THE ONE OF THE LYNCH PINS OF THAT FRAMEWORK -- THESE ARE THE THE BIG EXPENSIVE RETROFITS TO THAT WERE WERE THINKING ABOUT HERE WHERE IF TO REMAKE THE ENTIRE HOME THIS IS A SIMPLE IN SOME CASES PUTTING SOME GAS GETTING. AS I UNDERSTAND IT ON YOUR GARAGE OR MAKING SURE YOUR VENCER SEALED -- THERE MAY BE YOU KNOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BIG DECKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT OKAY WELL YOU IN THAT CASE YOU MAY HAVE TO HARDEN YOUR DECK BUT FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY. WOULD TALK I MEAN WHEN WE TALK TO THE FIRE MARSHAL -- REACH WINE. THE ESTIMATE WAS FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS WOULD EVEN GET YOU SOME WAYS MAYBE EVEN A THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU SEE I MEAN IN TERMS OF PRICE RANGES AND SORT OF THE EASY LOW HANGING FRUIT. IS IT IS THIS -- IS THIS GOING TO HELP YOU GET TO THOSE THOSE LOW HANGING PIECES MAYBE THERE'S BIGGER PIECES TO THAT YOU MIGHT NEED A LOAN FOR VIET MORE MEANS BUT DO YOU ENVISION THOSE ARE THE LOW COST EASY WHEN GAS AND AND AND WE'RE WORKING TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHAT THOSE ARE. AND AND TO GIVE PEOPLE AN IDEA WHAT THOSE LOW COST RETROFITS MIGHT MIGHT COST -- BUT YOU KNOW I COULD GO BACK TO SOME OF THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACES IS NOT A RETROFIT IT'S A IT'S IT'S ACTUAL ON THE BOOTS ON THE GROUNDS ON BOOTS ON THE GROUND. ACTIVITIES TO PROTECT YOUR HOME AND WE THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO KNOW THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THE HOME AND AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY AND HELP WITH IF WE CAN DO THAT. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ALREADY WE'VE APPROPRIATE IS A LEGISLATURE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS EARLIER THIS YEAR FOR AN OUTREACH EFFORT AT REGION EDUCATION I BELIEVE IS. THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF THOSE FUNDS I'M ALSO WONDERING IN THAT EFFORT. WORKING WITH FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE CD'S THOSE KIND OF FOLKS WHO ARE THOSE BOOTS ON THE GROUND MAYBE WE CAN START GETTING THE WORD OUT COMMUNITIES AT LEAST KNOCKING ON THE DOOR AND SAYING HEY. YOU KNOW. YOU'VE GOT AN ISSUE HERE AND YET TRYING TO JUST MITIGATE THAT RISK THE LAST THING I WOULD JUST NOTE FOR FUTURE PURPOSES. MY HOPE IS THAT. THE RISK WERE MITIGATING WITH YOUR BILL WHEN IT BECOMES LAW BECAUSE THIS NEEDS TO BECOME LAW. OUGHT TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SO THAT ALL THOSE WHO ARE HAVING THEIR POLICIES CANCELED OR NON RENEWALS WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT THEY SORT OF TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT RISK SO THEN. FOR THOSE HOMEOWNER TRANSACTIONS WE CAN ACTUALLY SAY OKAY YOU'VE DONE YOU'VE DONE THE WORK RIGHT YOU'VE DONE THE THE HEAVY LIFTING AND YOU OUGHT TO BE REWARDED FOR THAT AND THOSE WHO DON'T THEY OUGHT TO PAY THE PRICE OF THAT THAT RISK ON THEIR SYSTEM SO -- ANY OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN PARTNER HERE ALL TOGETHER AND TRY TO GET PREVENTION AS PART OF THIS BROADER PACKAGE I'LL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSER IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE FURTHER COMMENTS. TURN JONES ONE ITEM NUMBER ONE A. B. THIRTY EIGHT ON HOME HARDENING YES SIR. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM FOR JUST TAKE A PAUSE REAL QUICK. WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. STERN HERE STERN HERE JONES JONES HERE ALLEN PORCHES CARILLO -- HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON. JACKSON HERE MONEY. MONNING HERE. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS YOU GOOD OKAY ALLIED CLOSER JUST JUST BRIEFLY I THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND THANK YOU TO SENATOR JACKSON'S WELL LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH WITH ALL OF YOU ON THIS ON THIS EFFORT. I THINK FOR ME -- THIS IS THIS IS. A KEY LYNCH PIN TO THE WHOLE TO THE WHOLE BIG PICTURE -- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE OF THE CELL HOMES THAT THAT -- IN AREAS WHERE YOU CAN GET FIRE INSURANCE. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN PEOPLE I CAN BE ABLE TO BUILD NEW HOMES WERE YOU CAN'T GET FIRE INSURANCE AND SO. SO THE IDEA IS WE'RE TRYING TO TO PROVIDE TO TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE CAN PROTECT THEIR HOMES AND THEN BEABLE TO BUY INTERESTS WE HAVE ENTIRE ZIP CODES IN CALIFORNIA. THE HAVE BEEN CANCELED FIRE INSURANCE RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT AND THOSE ARE PEOPLE THEIR PEOPLE IN THE ZIP CODES WANT TO SELL THEIR HOMES. AND ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SOMEONE'S GONNA HAVE TO GO TO THE FAIR PLAN THEY'RE GONNA TO PAY TWICE AS MUCH FOR INSURANCE. IT IS GOING TO BE THE IT'S NOT COULD BE OF THE SAME QUALITY. SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH WITH THE THE OPPOSITION AS WE MOVE FORWARD BUT WE HAVE TO THINK THE BIG PICTURE IT'S IT'S PREVENTION BUT IT'S IS BROADER THAN THAT AND WE HAVE TO FIND THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS. RESPECTFULLY AFTER I LOVE SO MUCH I'D ENTERTAIN A MOTION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. MOTION SENATOR JACKSON -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATE STERN HI STERN I'D JONES.

THE MORNING MORNING WELCOME THANK THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THOUSANDS OF EXOTIC ANIMALS ARE KILLED FOR THEIR SKINS EACH YEAR THESE ANIMALS SUFFER GREATLY FOR THE SAKE OF FASHION AND VANITY EVEN WALL ALTERNATIVES EXIST. THERE ARE A BROAD ARRAY OF LUXURIOUS CRUELTY FREE MATERIALS AVAILABLE FOR USE -- INCLUDING EMBOSSED IMITATION WHETHER THAT LOOKS AND FEELS. JUST LIKE EXOTIC SKIN WITHOUT ANY OF THE CRUELTY SEVERAL LARGE RETAILERS HAVE ALREADY LED THE CHARGE IN BANNING THE SCANS INCLUDING CHANEL AND TAYLOR HMM ADIDAS AND VICTORIA'S SECRET. JUST TO NAME -- TO NAME JUST A FEW. AB TWELVE SIXTY WOULD BAN THE SALE OF AND THE IMPORTATION WITH THE INTENT TO SELL OF IGUANAS HIPPOS CAYMANS AND SEVERAL SPECIES OF LIZARDS. HERE AT TO TESTIFY -- IN SUPPORT RG DEMAND -- SO. AND THAT WHAT'S NEXT LAST NAME. THAT IT THANK YOU. I KNOW MISS NECK NECK IS HERE AS WELL VERY GOOD SIR THANK YOU SIR. WELCOME IS MAKING HI GOOD MORNING WE ARE PROUD SPONSOR OF AB TWELVE SIXTY AND WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN FOR CARRYING THIS. I ECHO THE STATEMENTS OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THROUGH HISTORICAL LEGISLATION DEMONSTRATED ITSELF TO BE A PROGRESSIVE IN RESPONSIBLE AT SORTIE AND ADOPTING PROVISIONS THAT HAVE AT THEIR CORE THE RATIONAL. PROTECTION OF WILDLIFE AND AS SUCH PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OR FOR OTHER STATES AS SOCIETY MOVES INEVITABLY TOWARDS INFORMED AN ETHICAL DECISION MAKING BY GOVERNMENT. AB TWELVE SIXTY CONSTITUTES A SELECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED INITIATIVE FOUNDED ON EXAMPLES OF ANIMAL ABUSE AND ECOLOGICAL HARM AND ALSO REPRESENTS A DIRECTION IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS WANT TO GO. LAST FALL WE CONDUCTED A POLL THROUGH CONSERVATIVE POLLSTER VERY WELL KNOWN IN THE STATE AND BAN ON THE SALE OF EXOTIC SKINS. OF THOSE 75% 83% SAY THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT. AB TWELVE SIXTY REFLECTS THE WILL OF CALIFORNIANS PROTECTS WILDLIFE INFORMED ANIMALS AND WITH THAT I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. SO MUCH MISTER SECOND. YES. IT WILL SUFFER IMMENSELY IN THE EXOTIC SKIN TRADE FOR EXAMPLES HUNTER SNEER WILD LIZARDS HACK THEM APART WITH MACHETES INCLUDING BY SEVERING THEIR HEADS AND THEN SCAN THEM. ONE OF ONE EXPOSE WHICH YOU CAN WATCH AND PETER DOT ORG SHOWS A LIZARD BEING SKINNED ALIVE IN WRITING IN AGONY. CLIFFORD WARRICK A PROMINENT SPECIALIST IN REPTILE BIOLOGY AND WELFARE WHO ALSO WROTE A DETAILED LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE. ON THE SUBJECT HAS WITNESSED SUCH ATROCITIES AND SAYS THAT BECAUSE REPTILES HAVE A SLOW METABOLISM THEY CAN REMAIN ALIVE FOR UP TO AN HOUR AFTER THE THEIR DECAPITATED AND SKINNED. CAYMANS TO ARE HUNTED AND KILLED IN THEIR HOMES IN NATURE OFTEN BY BEING CRUDELY SHOT IN THE HEAD SO THAT THEIR SKINS CAN BE TURNED INTO BAGS BOOTS ANOTHER EXCESS CERISE. CAYMANS ARE ALSO KEPT IN FITTED WATER. ON EXTREMELY CROWDED FARMS WHICH ARE OFTEN STOCKED BY CAPTURING ADULTS IN THE WILD AND FORCING THEM TO BREED. ALTHOUGH WE CAN LIVE TO BE ALTHOUGH THEY CAN LIVE TO BE SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD THOSE IN CAPTIVITY RARELY DO IN FACT THEY ARE KILLED BEFORE THEY EVEN REACH MATURITY. AND HIPPOS ARE OFTEN HUNTED AT NIGHT WHEN THEY EMERGE FROM THE WATER TO GRAZE HUNTERS THAN SNARE SPEAR AND KILL THEM FOR THEIR TEETH AND SKIN. PASSING AB TWELVE SIXTY WOULD SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT KILLING EXOTIC ANIMALS FOR THE SKINS HAS NO PLACE IN A COMPASSIONATE SOCIETY. OPPOSITION TO USING. EXOTIC SKINS IS GROWING AROUND THE WORLD AS A RESULT CHANEL STELLA MCCARTNEY AND OTHERS MADE MAJOR DESIGNERS AND RETAILERS HAVE ALREADY BANNED THEM FROM THEIR COLLECTIONS.

AT THE ONE THE ONE QUESTION I DID HAVE FOR YOU IS WE NEED TO MAKE THIS LAW WORK -- I WANT TO GET YOUR YOUR JUST YOUR QUICK TAKE ON ENFORCEMENT -- I NOTICED THAT THE FRAMEWORK HERE. THE FINES MAY NOT BE AS BIG MAYBE AS SOME OF THE OTHER FISHING GAME CODE VIOLATIONS AND ALSO UNDER THEIR SERVICE BASED BUDGETING WE'VE HAD CHALLENGES. JUST. I WANNA SEE THIS MOVIE I WAS IT IS LAW. ENFORCED JUST A QUICK INSIGHT ON THAT FOR US RIGHT SO. AS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS WHILE THE EXACT FINE IS SOMEWHAT LOW -- WITH ADD ONS IT CAN GET QUITE HIGH UP TO ABOUT TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ALSO. THERE ALREADY IS A LONG LIST OF ANIMALS WE DON'T EXPECT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO HIRE NEW PEOPLE TO ENFORCE THIS LAW BUT JUST SOMETHING THAT. CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE OF THE SERVICE WOULD KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR AND IDENTIFYING THESE KIND OF THINGS ARE NOT NEARLY AS HARD AS ONE WOULD THINK. SOCIETY'S HAS A LOT OF DOWNLOADABLE -- INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE SPECIES WITH OR THEY CAN SEND YOU SAMPLES AND THEN IF YOU EVEN NEED FURTHER -- YOU CAN SEND IT TO A LAB UP IN OREGON WHICH IS RUN BY THE US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE. THE ONE THE ONE THING I'LL JUST ASK AM VERY EXCITED BY THIS LEGISLATION IS JUST. FOR ALL THE ACTIVISTS AND ADVOCATES AS WELL AS THE ORGANIZATION SUPPORTING THE USE SOME MEMBER WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO GET. FISHING GAME SUSTAINABLY FUNDED FOR THEIR SERVICE BASS BHAJANS THEN GO OUT AND PROACTIVELY ENFORCE THIS KIND OF WORK SO JUST ON A GO FORWARD BASIS LOOK FRAMEWORK EVEYTHING ON THAT. AND I'LL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES THERE IS A MOTION -- AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. PLEASE CULTURAL CENTERS STERN HYPE STERN I'D JONES ALLEN. ALLEN AYE FORGES HAVE EURO.

THE C. D. C.'S AUTHORITY THE PRODUCT REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT PERMIT THAT MUST BE APPROVED BY THE CDC. AND THIS PROPOSED BILL. THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION A. B. C. B. C. WAS STAY FIRMLY IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. ON THIS PROJECT. AND THAT THAT OAK OAKLAND. AT THE CITY OF OAKLAND A SUPPORT COMMISSION A. B. C. B. C.

TO THIS PROJECT -- WE HAVE TO AGREE EMPHATICALLY WITH WHAT PRESIDENT -- CAVELL HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS PROJECT IS TRANSFORMATIVE. THEY'RE PROPOSING TO TRANSFORM. A MARINE TERMINAL INTO AT THREE THOUSAND UNIT HOUSING COMPLEX -- ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE AND THE STADIUM IN A HOTEL. RIGHT ON OUR DOORSTEP AND NEXT TO OUR OPERATIONS. THOSE OPERATIONS ARE PROTECTED BY STATE LAW -- HAND WE EXPECT THOSE -- PROTECTIONS TO BE FULLY ENFORCED -- BUT I YOU KNOW I THINK MOVING FORWARD -- AS I SAID I IF IF THE IF THE GOAL IS. TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS -- YOU DON'T NEED A BILL. AND AND THAT'S THAT IS I THINK PRINCIPALLY DRIVING A LOT OF OUR CONCERNS WITH WITH THIS PROCESS -- WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE ON ENABLE EVEN PLAYING FIELD -- WITH FOLKS WHO WOULD LIKE TO COME INTO THE PROCESS -- AND HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW YOU DEVELOP CALIFORNIA'S WATERFRONT -- WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE IS GOING TO BE. REALLY DETERMINED BY. HOW YOU PRESERVE ACCESS TO THE WORKING WATERFRONT? WE DO NOT CREATE NEW PORT PROPERTY WE DO NOT CREATE NEW DEEP WATER CHANNELS -- AND THE EXCHANGE AWAY. FROM THOSE TYPES OF PROPERTIES CAN OCCUR IT CAN OCCUR UNDER EXISTING STATE LAW AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED A BILL TO SETTLE TITLES BEATS THAT'S ALREADY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE CURRENT PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE -- SO A PROCEDURE TIME IN AND IN LETTING US HAVE OUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY THANK YOU FORCE. THANK YOU SIR. GERMAN STERN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HI MY NAME IS LEE SANDEL. I AM THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COUNCIL. OF THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE WAREHOUSE UNION. THE COUNCIL REPRESENTS LONG SHORE WAREHOUSE WORKERS MARINE CLERKS FOREMAN AND NAY IN LIMBO MENTION OF THE PACIFIC. AND THEIR MEMBERS FROM EUREKA TO FRESNO. WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB. ELEVEN NINETY ONE THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO ELIMINATE CURRENT PUBLIC TRUST PROTECTIONS AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND SOUR TERMINAL. EXISTING LAW GOVERNING TIDELANDS IS HELD IN THE PUBLIC TRUST IN GOVERNMENT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. THE PUBLIC TRUST PROTECTIONS. FOR TAX -- PROTECTS WATER WAYS FOR NATURAL HABITAT AND MARITIME ACTIVITIES. A. B. ELEVEN NINETY ONE IS PART OF AN EFFORT TO REMOVE THESE PROTECTIONS IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE OPENING DAYS. BASEBALL ORGANIZATION TO TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY. IN THE ART OF THE PORT. AND TO LUXURY HOUSING AND HIGH RISE OFFICE COMPLEXES. NEXT TO THE PROPOSED STADIUM AND HOTEL. OUR MARITIME WORKFORCE REPRESENTS SOME OF THE HIGHEST SKILLED AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED BLUE COLLAR LABOR IN NORTH AMERICA. WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE CITY AND IS POOR COMMISSION SEEM TO HAVE A NEW VISION OF THE PORT. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE US. THIS IS TROUBLING HIM CONCERNING AND THE FACT THAT IT REDUCES PORT AREA MEANS REDUCE WORK OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE MARITIME WORKING COMMUNITY IN THE BAY AREA. ALSO TRADING ACTIVE MARITIME WATERFRONT PROPERTY WHICH CAN NEVER BE REPLACED ONCE IT IS GONE. FOR LUXURY HOUSING AND OFFICE SPACE. IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH OUR OPERATIONS IN CREATES NEW ENVIRONMENTAL AND TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES. FOR THE CURRENT AND FUTURE SEAPORT OPERATIONS AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC TRUST BY NOT ALLOWING FOR THE FOR THE PROJECT. IT'S AN EXCUSE ME I JUST LOST MY SPOT CHECK THE PUBLIC TRUST BY NOT ALLOWING FOR THE CREATION OF HOUSING OFFICE STADIUM. COMPLEXES ON OR WORKING WATERFRONT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSHUA SHAW REPRESENTING A COUPLE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COALITION OPPOSES PROJECT.

MY CHECK OF EXPLICATED BUT DOES DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. AARON RIGHT INTERNATIONAL LONGSHOREMEN'S. WAREHOUSE UNION. A BEEN A LONG SHERMAN FOR THIRTY YEARS AND WE ARE. ON THE CURRENT BUSINESS AGENT WE'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROJECT. WE DID NOT SEE A FUTURE FOR THE PORT OF OAKLAND WITH A STADIUM IN THE CURRENT LOCATION. THERE'S A CONFLUENCE OF RAIL TRUCKING OVERWEIGHT TRUCKING INDUSTRIAL ZONE. AND IF YOU PUT A BASEBALL STADIUM WITH FOUR THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING. RIGHT SMACK DAB RIGHT THERE. IT'S GOING TO KILL OUR PORT. THIS PORTS SERVICES NOT JUST THE LONGSHOREMEN BUT THOUSANDS OF TRUCKERS. IT'S SERVICES AGRIBUSINESS YOUR RETAIL YOUR MANUFACTURING FOR CALIFORNIA. YEAH A. B. NICE SHINEE'S PEARL IN OAKLAND. IT SHOULD BE. IN EAST OAKLAND RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE NOW. THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF THIS LOCATION HUNDRED FIFTY ACRES. TO BE PERFECT FOR A NEW BALLPARK. YOU COULD BUILD PLENTY A HOUSING PLENTY OF LOW INCOME HOUSING. YOU GET YOU HAVE GOOD TRANSPORTATION IT'S ALREADY THERE [inaudible] WE NEED. THANK YOU UNDERSTOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ONE MORE THING THIS WOMAN. PLEASE AND AND AND ALL THE WORKERS THAT CAME HERE TODAY THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT. THAT'S WHAT I WANNA SAY THEY WILL STILL HAVE A JOB WE DON'T WANT THEM TO LOSE THEIR JOBS WE DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE OF EAST OAKLAND TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. WE WANT TO KEEP OUR JOBS IF YOU WANT TO KEEP. THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHY AND STRONG THANK YOU. AND AS YOU TESTIFIED JUST BEAR IN MIND THE AMENDMENTS WILL STILL REQUIRE. LOCAL PERMITTING APPROVAL ALL NECESSARY APPROVAL SO. THE GOAL OF THE MEASURE NOW. IS NOT NECESSARILY TO GREEN LIGHT OR RUBBER STAMP THIS PROJECT. THEY WILL THEY WILL STILL BE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS THESE DEBATES AS YOU GO FORWARD -- BUT HOPEFULLY PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE CERTAINTY IN THE PROCESS SO WITH ALL MY NAME IS TIM MAMA LONGSHOREMAN WORKER AT SAN FRANCISCO WE ALSO WORK IN OAKLAND THAT'S BASICALLY OUR MAIN PORT -- LIKE THE YOUNG MAN JUST SAID THESE TRUCKS THAT COME IN DALY WE'RE LOOKING AT THOUSANDS OF TRUCKS COMING IN. THANK YOU VERY VERY BIG TRAFFIC SO AS FAR AS THE OTHER WORKERS THAT WANT THIS AND THEY WITH IT. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE JOBS BUT THE THING IS THIS IS GOING TO LAST FOR A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE FULL TIME PERMANENT JOBS THEIR SEASONAL. THEY'RE NOT FULL TIME DAYS PLAY CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GAMES AND IT'S OVER. THANK YOU SIR I WOULD LIKE IT I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE BUILT IN EAST OAKLAND WORDS AT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO MOVE IT IT'S ALL DOWN THERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS MARIN PM WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE AND WAREHOUSE UNION. WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING AND LOW INCOME HOUSING FOR THIS PROJECT AND THE NEED FOR HOUSING BECAUSE OF A HOMELESS WE WE SEE THAT EVERYWHERE I THINK AT AS THE POINTS FOR THIS BILL THERE'S NOTHING IN THE PLAN FOR THAT WE WE WANT TO SEE THAT IF IT'S A TRUE EFFORT. TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY DOES DOES DETAILS HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT AND WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS THAT ARE AYE AYE FAMILIES DEPEND ON THE JOBS AND I KNOW THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILLS DON'T WANNA DISPLAYS THOSE WORKERS I THINK. THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY WHERE WE ARE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE AND ACTUALLY WORKED OUT THE DETAILS THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE'RE JUST GONNA GO NAME AFFILIATION IN YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL GOING FORWARD WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CONTAIN THE NAME AND PRICE OF LOCAL TEN MILE W. ON THE MARSHALL TEN YES SIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR IT. WE HEARD. WE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DIS MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. A QUESTION FROM CENTER BOARD JUST. I JUST WANT TO CONFIRMATION I THINK -- OUR CHAIRMAN I HAD RE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS GOES THIS WILL CONTINUE GO THROUGH A LOCAL LAND USE PROCESS. SEQUEL WILL STILL HAVE TO BE GONE THROUGH SO IF THERE'S TRAFFIC RELATED ISSUES ENVIRONMENTAL. CONCERNS THAT WILL BE THOROUGHLY REVIEWED. DURING THAT PROCESS IS THAT CORRECT AS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF OAKLAND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL USE OUR LOCAL CONTROL. TO DO A THOROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT WE WILL HEAR FROM ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS OAKLAND IS CERTAINLY KNOWN FOR BEING A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE HAVING THEIR DEMANDS HEARD. SO I ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL HAVE A VERY ROBUST AND ACTIVE SESSION DURING THE SEQUEL PROCESS -- WE EXPECT A DRAFTEE I ARE TO BE PREPARED SOMETIME THIS FALL AND I ASSURE YOU THERE WILL BE MUCH ROBUST DEBATE. AS THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THAT GOES FORWARD BUT WHEN WE MET YESTERDAY -- I LEARNED THAT -- THE CITY COUNCIL -- UNANIMOUSLY VOTED IN SUPPORT OF MOVING THIS PROJECT ALONG IS THAT CORRECT. THE CITY COUNCIL TOOK A POSITION ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND THEY TOOK A POSITION SUPPORT IF AMENDED THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT YOU HAVE MADE HERE TODAY ARE IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT THE CITY COUNCIL ASKED FOR SO ABSOLUTELY AND THAT WAS A UNANIMOUS VOTE. INDEED YOU FULL OPENING THE QUESTION THAT I POSED TO YESTERDAY BY CHANCE DID YOU HAVE OCCASION TO ON YEAH WE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO THE POOR AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY FEDERAL -- REQUIRED BASED ON THE CURRENT LOCATION OF HOWARD TERMINAL AND ITS IMPACT ON THE LARGER PORT. MY POSE IN OFF A FINISH WITH THIS MIGHT UNCERTAIN YESTERDAY WAS OUTSIDE OUR JURISDICTIONS MORE ON NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF MODIFYING A VALUED POURED IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION AND IN OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT. INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE BE A C. WAYS. I CONSULTED WITH THE MICHAEL GROSSMAN -- WHO IS A NATIONAL SECURITY REALM WITHIN -- THE COMMITTEES AND I GOT CONFIRMATION THAT -- THERE WERE NO CONCERNS ON THEIR END AS WELL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR CENTER BORDER CENTER HUESO MEN SENATOR MONNING. I JUST WANTED TO ASK OF ANYBODY THAT KNOWS -- THE BOUNDARIES OF THE COASTAL ZONE. IF THIS PROJECT IS WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE GOVERNED BY THE COSTA COMMISSION. I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A A SOME CARVE OUTS IN THE BAY AREA THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY. THE COSTA COMMISSIONS ANYBODY KNOW THAT ANSWER [inaudible] THE CDC [inaudible] I'M I'M [inaudible] GOV. THE STOCK ON THE COAST I'M HAPPY TO JUST THAT VERY QUICKLY MISS GERMANY LANDS DO YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN. THE CHAIR SHERRY PEMBERTON WAS STATE LANDS COMMISSION I I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION HERE. BECAUSE THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION HAS JURISDICTION. IN THIS AREA SO WHO WOULD BE THE OF THIS. THE STATE AGENCY OR A LOCAL -- BUT THE PORT AUTHORITY OR SOMEBODY THAT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE FINAL DETERMINATION ON ON COASTAL ACCESS AND AND GOVERNING. OF THE WHETHER WHETHER THIS LAND -- IS -- INTENDED FOR COASTAL PURPOSES COASTAL DEPENDENT USES AND AND THE LIKE. I BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE BE CDC. THERE THERE'S THREE THINGS B. C. D. C. WHICH IS A REGIONAL AUTHORITY THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER ALL COASTAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE BAY. STATE LANDS ALSO HAS -- MANY RESTRICTIONS ABOUT USE OF LAND AND THEY WILL STILL RETAIN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNTOF THAT. BUT IF I CAN SAY THE CITY OF OAKLAND TREMENDOUSLY VALUES ARE MARITIME INDUSTRY IT IS A HUGE ECONOMIC ENGINE -- I PERSONALLY AND THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS FOR THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS CITY IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT THIS MARITIME INDUSTRY IS STRONG AND FLOURISHING. THIS PROJECT DOES NOT. THREATEN THE MARITIME INDUSTRY. IT WE ABSOLUTELY CAN HAVE BOTH A GREAT MIXED USE BALLPARK AND VERY STRONG MARITIME INDUSTRY IN OAKLAND. WELL IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE HELPFUL. IF I HEARD FROM THE LONGSHOREMEN SAYING THAT WOULD IT WOULD SUPPORT. THERE OF INDUSTRY AND THEN WHEN YOU SAY THAT IT SUPPORTS SHIPPING OF I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THEM. SAY YES THIS PROJECT WHICH SUPPORTS SUPPORTS HAVE WRECKED I RECOGNIZE THAT THEY LOOK ACROSS THE BAY AND THEY SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS NOT THE CAMEL'S NOSE UNDER THE TENT. HOWARD TERMINAL HAS NOT BEEN USED AS A MARITIME TERMINAL SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN IS ON THE MOST SHALLOW PART OF THE CHANNEL WE HAVE UNDER LEAST TERMINALS. ON OUR DEEP WATER SEAPORT SITE WE ALSO HAVE ADJUSTED THIS PROJECT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ACCOMMODATE A MUCH LARGER TURNING BASIN. SO THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO WELCOME THE LARGEST SHIPS IN THE WORLD TWO OAKLAND. AND WE ANTICIPATE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND CARGO WITH OUT THIS RETURN THAT AGAIN IN TERMS OF THAT THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO HELP. EXPAND [inaudible] A TERMINAL. THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE A WIDER TURNING BASE IN IN THE CHANNEL ITSELF I WOULD THAT BE ACCOMPLISHED ANOTHER WORDS THE PROJECT ALLOWS A PORTION OF THE LAND TO BE SET ASIDE SO THAT IF WE ACTUALLY AND AGAIN WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT WE WILL NEED TO THIS. IS ALL BEING STUDIED BY THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS BUT IF WE NEED TO ACTUALLY. DIG INTO ACT I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAVE ISN'T DOING THIS BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW JUST SO YOU KNOW I AM ON TOP OF THIS OKAY I CARE TREMENDOUSLY ABOUT THIS. SO WE HAVE STUDIED POTENTIAL WIDENING OF THE TURNING BASIN AND THAT MEANS THAT A SHIP KIND O PULLS IN AND THEN LITERALLY DOES A PIVOT IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH I WELCOME YOU TO COME DOWN AND WATCH IT. SO THERE'S ATTORNEY BASED IN THERE RIGHT NOW IT'S DUG OUT AND IT IT HAS TO BE WIDE ENOUGH TO THE WHOLE SHIP CAN TURN AROUND WE ACTUALLY HAVE. PASSED THE ETS TO REDESIGN THE PROJECT WE'VE EXPANDED THE THE PORTION UNDER STATE LANDS CONTROL SO THAT IF NEEDED WE CAN ACTUALLY. DIG OUT THAT PART OF THE SHORELINE TO COMEDY THE ABSOLUTE LARGEST SHIPS WE WANT THE PORT OF OAKLAND TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE WANT OUR LONG SHORT AND BUSY AND WORKING. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE PORT OF OAKLAND HERE MAYBE A MATH BOOK AND BEFORE WE GET INTO THIS THE BILLING CHIEF BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IS NOT ABOUT THE MERITS OF THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR APPROVAL AND JUST TO BE CLEAR. THE AUTHORIZATIONS AND SPILLWAYS WE HAD A LONG IN DEPTH MEETING WITH I'LL W. YESTERDAY. AS WELL AS PAM SO. AND WE CAN MAYBE GET THEIR CONFIRMATION AS WELL THEY THEY CERTAINLY MAY STILL BE OPPOSE THE PROJECT. I AM I AM ONLY ASKING ABOUT PROCESS MR THE PROCESS HERE IS THEM PRIOR TO SO PRIOR TO ANY B. C. D. C. SUBMISSION. OR ANY STATE LANDS COMMISSION SUBMISSION SO BEFORE THE STATE AGENCIES CAN ENTERTAIN A PUBLIC TRUST A TERMINATION OR THOSE SORT OF COASTAL ACCESS QUESTIONS. THESE LOCAL DECISIONS HAVE TO GET MADE FIRST SO ALL LOCAL APPROVALS HAVE TO OCCUR SO JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WITHIN THE PROCESS THERE IS A CONSIDERATION. SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND THAT'S ENSURING PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE COAST. AND ALSO PROTECTING COASTAL DEPENDENT USES AND IF WE'RE GONNA AND AND AGAIN THE THE BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY COMPROMISED THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WHICH IS CHARGED WITH THE VERY VALUE THAT YOU JUST ARTICULATED OKAY. THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA COME JUST IN ORDER HERE SO SENATOR MINING. THEN THE VICE CHAIR. AND BACK TO SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU GUYS CHAIR WELL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR THE WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. IN FOR ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS. WELCOME TO THE MAYOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS AS WELL. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACT STUDIES ARE UNDER WAY NOW. IN THOSE COMPLETION OF THOSE IS A PRECONDITION. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS BEFORE APPROACHING STATE LANDS -- AND I THINK THIS IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BUT CAN YOU REMIND ME THE FUNDING FOR THE STADIUM THIS. IS ALL PRIVATELY FINANCE THE STATE. BASED ON NO PUBLIC FUNDS IN THE CONSTRUCTION. PUBLIC BENEFITS INCLUDING A COMMUNITY AND IF IT'S AGREEMENT OBVIOUSLY -- OTHER BENEFITS FOR THE CITY OF THE COMMUNITY YES. AND ARE THERE A DEVELOPER'S IDENTIFIED FOR THE HOUSING COMPONENT OR IS THAT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD THAT STILL BEING DETERMINED AT THIS TIME BUT IT'LL INCLUDE A ROBUST AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN TO ENSURE THAT WE REALLY REALLY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. IS THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCLUDE LOW INCOME HOUSING IS SOMETIMES THOSE TERMS GET. MURDER GET INCLUDE ALL LEVELS OF HOUSING YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER MONNING MISTER VICE CHAIR. HE WAS A CHAIR -- MR BONTA. YOU KNOW I I CAN SEE THIS AS A LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE SO I'M TRYING TO GET TO YES ON THIS THANK YOU -- I THINK THE AMENDMENTS MAKE IT BETTER. THAT IS GOOD TO SEE THE TEAMSTERS HERE -- TODAY BELIEVE OR NOT MY DAUGHTER'S A TEAMSTER. AND ONE OF MY SONS -- SO I APPRECIATE THEIR TESTIMONY. THERE'S A SOME TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE STATE ISSUES HERE ARE IN IN AND ANALYZING THIS BILL. AND SO I I THINK I'M DOWN TO TWO QUESTIONS -- AND I'D AND THINK I'M AS EASY ONE FOR ALL ASSN BOTH AND THEN YOU ANSWER HOW YOU AN ANSWER -- IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP SEVERAL TIMES THAT THERE'S IN THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS -- AS PART OF THIS PROJECT I VAST -- YOU KNOW PROPONENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE ABOUT THAT SO IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT AND AND RATE REALLY WHAT MY CONCERN IS BASED ON MY KNOWLEDGE ON IT BEING A CITY COUNCIL IN ZONING. TO FIT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS ON THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY YOU'RE GONNA. YOU KNOW I'M JUST GUESSING AT THIS POINT TIME AND PINS THAT ARE COMPLETELY BUT THIRTY STORY BUILDINGS ARE GOING TO GET IT DONE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SIXTY SEVENTY STORY BUILDINGS. TO GET TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS ON THIS SMALL PIECE OF PROPERTY -- SO WHERE THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS GOING OUT OR IS THAT EVEN. IT IS THE PROJECT -- RELIANT ON THAT -- AND IN THIS I THINK THAT THE STATE ISSUE THAT I'M MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS ON THE LAND SWAP -- THIS THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA ARE GIVING UP. A POTENTIALLY VERY VALUABLE PIECE OF PROPERTY HERE IN THE BAY. WHAT ARE THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA? GETTING IN RETURN OF EQUAL OR GREATER VALUE THAN WHAT THE TAX PAYERS ARE GIVING UP. THOSE TWO THINGS THIS LAND SWAP IN THAT AND THE NUMBER OF UNITS. AND THE AND THE NUMBER OF UNITS IS MORE OF A CURIOSITY THAN ACTUALLY I MEAN ON THE NUMBER OF UNITS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING WTH THE ARCHANGELS GROUP IN FIELD OPERATIONS OUR DESIGN TEAM. AND ACTUALLY WE CAN HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF SIZES OF BUILDINGS TO ACCOMMODATE THAT NUMBER AND KEEP IN MIND THAT'S JUST A PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORTY THE INITIAL SEQUEL STUDIES. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS DETERMINE WHAT IS VIABLE AT THAT LOCATION. SO WHAT WHAT I'M HEARING YOU ANSWER NOW IS THE PROJECT IS NOT DEPENDENT UPON THE NUMBER OF UNITS -- BEING PROPOSED WE WE STILL HAVE TO STUDY THAT TO DETERMINE WHAT HOW IT'S GONNA PLAY OUT YES RIGHT SENATE AND MISTER MUCH OF YOU CAN ANSWER TOWARD OR YOU KNOW TOWARD THE LAND SWAP. YEAH I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE ROLE OF OF STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE YOU KNOW WHAT TO THE TRUST IS IS IS MADE HOLE THAT THERE'S NO NET LOSS TO THE TRUST IN THAT THE LAND OF SIMILAR VALUE. NEARBY OR POTENTIALLY ELSEWHERE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO TO DO THE DEAL -- ARE REPLACED TO THE THE THE STATE LANDS I TRUST SO -- THAT'S WHY WE WE HAVE THIS PROCESS THAT'S WHY THEY'VE BEEN AT THE TABLE -- AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR INTENT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THAT THE STATE LAND REQUIREMENTS AND THAT. THE STATE LANDS TRUSSES METAL. OKAY SO -- A CURRENT YEAR AMENDMENTS AND THE STATE LAND TRUSTS HAS A SEAT AT THE TABLE IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS TO BE APPROVED. THEY HAVE TO APPROVE THE LAND SWAP BEFORE THIS GOES FORWARD ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. THE VICE CHAIR OF COMING BACK TO CENTER HERTZBERG AND THEN. I JUST WANT TO SHARE FOR THE RECORD A COUPLE COMMENTS COUPLE THOUGHTS I HAD THE RESPECT TO THIS. TRANSACTION OBVIOUSLY IT CHANGES TO SOME EXTENT BY VIRTUE OF THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE BILL FIRST [inaudible] ARMED. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE ALL FACE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT ISSUE NO MATTER MAYOR IN TERMS OF LAND USE IN PARTICULAR. IS SOMEONE THE EXAMPLE THAT I USE IN A MEETING I HAD YESTERDAY WHO'S NEXT TO A FREEWAY. GETS A HOUSE FOR HALF PRICE BECAUSE OUR NEXT TO THE FREEWAY AND HE GETS UPSET BECAUSE IT'S TOO LOUD. WRITER SOMEBODY MOVES NEXT TO AN AIRPORT AND THEN OBJECTS TO THE AIRPLANE NOISE WHEN THEY BOUGHT A HOUSE. NEXT TO AN AIRPORT. AND SO NOW YOU'VE GOT THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT PART OF A TWO THOUSAND ACRE. OUR PORT THAT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT TO A PART OF COMMERCE WITH RESPECT. TO THE UNITED STATES I WOULD JUST SAY STE CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY REALLY THINK IT'S PART OF THE WHOLE UNITED STATES A GRID IF YOU WILL. SO THE QUESTION IS MY MY SUGGESTION AS YOU MOVE FORWARD JUST TO THROW IT OUT THERE. I MISSED BONTA IS TO MAY BE REQUIRE -- LIKE WE DO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE THE STATE DEPARTMENT VILLA STATE SOME TYPE OF DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT UP FRONT -- SO THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THEY ARE PART OF THIS. COMPLEX BUT IF THEY'RE GONNA LIVE THERE OR THEY CAN HAVE A STORE THERE BECAUSE YOU END OF GETTING LAWSUITS ALL THE TIME WE DID KNOW THIS WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT. YOU LITERALLY LIKE WHEN YOU BUY A HOUSE AND YOU HAVE A DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. WITH GREAT CLARITY IN THE STATUTE TO ADD SOMETHING IN THAT REQUIRES THAT LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE SO THAT WHEN YOU DO THIS PROJECT GOING FORWARD. YOU DON'T END UP HAVING A GIGANTIC PROBLEM WITH LAWSUITS OR OTHER KINDS OF CHALLENGES OUR NEIGHBORS THAT THAT OCCUPY THESE BUILDINGS AND SAY OH MY GOD WITH ALL THESE TRUCKS ARE GOING THROUGH THE SHIP NOISE OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. AS OUR CHALLENGES A LIVING APPROXIMATE TO SUCH AN IMPORTANT. INDUSTRIAL ARE PRICED SECOND. ARMED WITH RESPECT TO THE THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS TO DO THIS -- FINANCIALLY BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU KNOW YEAH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE TRUCKS MOVING MAYBE YOU GET A VIEW OUT THE BIG GRADE SEPARATIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. AS YOU HAVE AN OPERATING PORT BUT YOU COULD POSSIBLY CREATE A DEDICATED REVENUE STREAM OUT OF THE NEW REVENUES GENERATED FROM THIS FACILITY RIGHT THIS CAN BE A LOT OF BRADLEY BIRDS TAX CREDIT AND SALES TAX. THERE'S GONNA BE ALL SORTS OF NEW PROPERTY TAXES GENERATED BIZ RESULT OF THIS YOU THINK OF THIS IDEA. AND THAT ALLOCATE. SKINNER HAS A BILL THAT ISSUE WITH US SENATOR SKINNER. BUT ALLOCATE BUT THAT'S OUR FINANCING PEACE BUT THE ALLOCATION OF MONEY TO THAN HELP SUPPORT THE PORT. THAT'S MY POINT NOT NOT THE ABILITY TO FINANCE IT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS IS THAT OUR IS SUPPORT I NUMBER FINANCING BY VOTE ON THAT BILL YEAH BUT THE GOOD QUESTION IS IS TO CREATE SOME REVENUE STREAM. OUT OF THIS PROJECT IT WOULD BE DEDICATED THAT WOULD SUPPORT SOME OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE PORT THE CLEANING UP OF THE PORT OTHER THINGS. SO THAT YOU YOU KNOW SO LET'S ASSUME FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE IT GENERATED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF NEW REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT. YOU TAKE X. PERCENTAGE THAT REVENUE CRATE SOME FUND THAT THEN COULD GO INTO. CLEAN UP THE PORT FIX THE FORT MEADE CERTAIN PORT SOCIAL PUBLIC POLICY OPERATIONAL NEEDS THAT COULD. MITIGATE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CORRECT ARE OFTEN ARE CREATED IN THE TENSIONS THAT EXIST WHERE YOU HAVE THESE IN A CO EXISTING -- DEALS AND CENTER ACTUALLY OUT ON THAT POINT. ARE TERM SHEET AGREEMENT WITH THE PORT OF OAKLAND STIPULATES A FUNDING MECHANISM AS YOU HAVE ARTICULATED OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GUARANTEED PAYMENTS UP TO POTENTIALLY SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION THAT WOULD GO TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND FOR THESE TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO WE'VE BEEN SPENDING ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF WITH THE PORT NEGOTIATING THIS ECONOMIC TERMS THAT THERE CAN BE REAL BENEFITS. FOR THE POOR TO USE AS THEY SEE FIT YEAH BECAUSE AT SUCH MEAN YET THREE POINT. SUCH AN IMPORTANT I USED TO CHAIR THE LOS ANGELES ACCOUNT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BRITIAN AND WE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE PORTS AND IN A LOS ANGELES AND AND AND AND LONG BEACH AND WE JUST EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- ECONOMIC DRIVERS OF SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO AND HAS IMPACTS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTS THEIR PRODUCTIVITY. YOU KNOW SO I JUST THINK THAT'S PART OF A LARGER ITEMS UNDERSTANDING WHO STAKEHOLDERS ARE THERE'S A LARGER DYNAMIC IN THAT REGARD IS ONE SURE THAT FUN THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATORS WERE A CENTER CENTER JACKSON. AND I WANTED TO SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT WHEN SOMEONE WANTS TO BUILD SOMETHING BIG THEY DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW SEE. AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING AND I THINK IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN THERE WILL BE SOME UPS AND DOWNS I'M SURE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE PORT. OF OAKLAND IS A CRITICAL ECONOMIC DRIVER IN THE STATE VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR WELL BEING AND ALL AND I I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT BEING PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS WELL [inaudible] SO THAT. WE CAN CONTINUE TO SEE THAT -- IS A ROBUST PRODUCTIVE -- INSTRUMENT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT IN THE THING SINCE SHE WAS DESIGNED TO DO SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THOSE MOMENTS THERE. BY DOING SO I I'M ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THIS PROCESS MOST THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US OUR LAWFUL WITH. THANK CENTER JACKSON. CENTER HAVE YOUR YEAH MY APOLOGY FOR MISSING A LOT OF THE PRESENTATION AND THEN JUST WALKING IN AND ASKING QUESTIONS SO I APOLOGIZE IF THEY'VE BEEN ANSWERED AYE THERE'S THERE WERE TWO ISSUES THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT I WAS SET ON ONE IS THAT IN REALITY THIS IS A PROPERTY TRANSFER IT'S NOT ANY. ENTITLE MENTOR ANY -- WAVING OF ANY REQUIREMENTS YOU DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY HAVE TO DO NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS -- JUSTIFIED TODAY WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT BILLS IT DIDN'T DEAL WITH SEA LEVEL RISE AND ADAPT TAPES ADAPTATION AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. I'D LIKE TO BE INCREASING DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE COAST A REGION -- AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HARDEN OUR SEALEVEL RISE ISSUES AND SO I I I I I MY QUESTION REALLY. HAS TO DO WITH HOW ARE YOU. YOU KNOW MA'AM I'M ASSUMING THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE MITIGATEDSOMEHOW IN IN -- YEAH AND DOCUMENT DOCUMENTS AND BILLS WILL SEE ALL OF THAT ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE COMMITTED TO PRIVATELY FINANCING -- HANDLING THE RESILIENCY AND THE SEA LEVEL RISE ISSUES AT HOWARD TERMINAL RIGHT NOW IT'S NOTHING WAS DONE EVENTUALLY WE JUST BECOME KIND OF FLOODED BUT WE'RE GONNA BE RAISING THE SITE BY OVER SIX FEET. MAKING SURE IT FITS INTO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT -- POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THE PROJECT. WHERE IF I AM IN ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS -- THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE THE OPC -- OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL EIGHT DAVE MAXI LEVEL RISE AND SO THERE HI RANGE SEA LEVEL RISE SCENARIO WHICH THEY CALL AGE PLUS PLUS. THAT'S THE WORST SEA LEVEL RISE SCENARIO THAT'S REQUIRED NOW TO BE ANALYZED IN THE COURSE OF THE DEVELOPMENT SO THEY HAVE TO ACTIVELY PLAN FOR THAT. JUST TO CLARIFY. YEAH THAT THAT'S AS A SECTION FOR OF OF THE STAFF ANALYSIS WE APPRECIATE THE MOMENT. CLARIFICATION YEAH ABSOLUTELY -- WE'VE BEEN THOROUGH. I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION. AND THE MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO APPROPRIATIONS. WE KNOW THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE. A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR THE EIGHTIES. LOT OF COMPLEXITIES IN AROUND THE LAND USE LABOR -- PRE SHEET YOU WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN. PRESERVING IS LOCAL PROCESS AND BETTER MAYOR IN. IN KABUL -- THE ONE I JUST ASK IS THIS BILL EVOLVES IF IF THERE ARE MAJOR CHANGES OR ANY. FURTHER AMENDMENTS OUT WE LOVE YOU TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND RESERVE THAT RIGHT. TO SEE IT AGAIN IF IF THERE'S SOME BIG CHANGE IN THE FUTURE BUT I THINK IT'S A PRETTY DECENT WORK PRODUCT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH HERE TODAY. ED. AND RESPECTING THE CONCERNS BUT I'M COME FROM MOVING THE BILL FOR TODAY SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- FROM SENATOR JACKSON'S TO PASS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. WILL LIGHT A CLOSER. JUST VERY BRIEFLY FOR SOMEONE I THANK THE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR DID IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE BILL WE'VE CREATED A PROCESS THAT I THINK IS AN OUTSTANDING PROCESS THAT WILL HELP. MAKE SURE THAT -- WE ARE COMPLYING WITH ALL THE REQUISITE RULES AND REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE THIS A AN OUTSTANDING PROJECT -- FROM ALL MEASURES. ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT ABOUT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION -- WE DON'T THINK THAT A SUCCESSFUL PORT OF OAKLAND WITH GREAT JOBS FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND THIS PROJECT ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WE THINK THEY CAN EXIST TOGETHER AND WILL EXIST TOGETHER AND AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AS AS THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT REPRESENTS THE TO THE SOME WHICH AFFECT. THE PORT OF OAKLAND IS IN MY DISTRICT -- IT'S THE FIFTH LARGEST PORT IN THE NATION BY CONTAINER VOLUME IT'S WHEN THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC DRIVERS IN THE EAST BAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US WE WANT TO SUCCEED WE'RE COMMITTED TO HAVING A SICK SUCCEED. AND WE BELIEVE A NEW BALL PARK PROJECT -- WILL THAT CAN PEACEFULLY COEXIST AND AND AND THAT THAT SUCCESS CAN CONTINUE -- AND SOME OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL RETAIL THERE'S HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL RETAIL ALL AROUND THE PORT NOW -- SAID THIS ISN'T NEW -- AND WITH WITH THE PROPER PLANNING WITH BUFFER ZONES WITH GRADE SEPARATIONS -- WITH OTHER SOLUTIONS -- WE THINK THIS IS GONNA BE OUTSTANDING PROJECT THE SPACE THAT ALLOWS OUR PORT. TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE -- WITH WITH GREAT JOBS WORKING PEOPLE THE ALAMEDA LABOR COUNCIL IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS THE PORT OF OAKLAND IS UNANIMOUSLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS -- SO WE THINK REMOVED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES AHEAD BUT WE'RE COMMITTED TO ADDRESS EACH OF THEM AS THEY COME. THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT YOU LEAVE IT LAID OUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR OUT. THANK YOU THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE STERN I'D JONES ALLEN. OR JUST. CABALLERO CABALLERO AYE HERTZBERG HUESO. JACKSON JACKSON AYE MONEY IN MONEY NINE HAS FOR SO THAT IS FOUR VOTES WILL LEAVE THE MEASURE ON CALL THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME EVERYONE SHOWED UP HERE TODAY I CAN SECURE THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU STAFF THANK YOU. OKAY SENATOR THANK YOU FOR WAITING PATIENTLY. WE'LL GIVE YOU JUST -- ONE MINUTE TO TO EXIT THE ROOM AND RECONVENE HERE. BUT LET'S MAKE IT IS SPEEDY ONE MINUTE FOLKS. YOU ALL ARE WELCOME TO TALK OUTSIDE THE WHOLE. FOLKS WE'RE GONNA ASK YOU TO TAKE THE CONVERSATION THAT THE WHOLE WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. HI GOOD TO SEE A TEN EIGHT ZERO MARK THANKS FOR BEING HERE PROBABLY. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH SHE ASKED ME WHAT I WAS DOING [inaudible] I YES I WILL BE [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. WE'RE ALMOST THERE. THE SERGEANTS YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK IN THE HALL LOOKS LIKE WE GOT A LITTLE BOTTLE NECK OUT THERE [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL WE'RE GONNA RECONVENE HERE. THANK YOU SIMILAR FOR YOUR PATIENCE. WE HAVE BEFORE US. I NUMBER TWO IF YOU WANT TO GO FIRST AB FORTY FOUR VERY GOOD -- PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS. I BRING YOU TODAY A BILL THAT WOULD BRING STATEWIDE -- A POLICY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN INSTITUTED IN SOME OF OUR LARGEST CITIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO. WILL THAT WOULD REINFORCE CALIFORNIA'S VALUES OF MAKING SURE THAT PRODUCTS THAT WE OFFER TO CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE AS CRUELTY FREE AS POSSIBLE. NOW THE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TOLD US IN MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THAT IF THEY BY. AEGS IF THEY PURCHASE MEAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PRODUCT HAS BEEN RECENT AWAY THAT IS THIS FREE IS CRUELTY AS WE CAN GET. BUT WE HAVE NO WAY OF DOING THAT WITH THE FOR INDUSTRY MOST FOR PRODUCTS COME FROM OVERSEAS. FROM COUNTRIES WERE REGULATION IS IMPOSSIBLE MANY ANIMALS THAT ARE USED FOR FOR PRODUCTS ARE ANIMALS THAT BY THEIR VERY NATURE IS WILD ANIMAL SUFFER WHEN THEY'RE IN CAPTIVITY UNLIKE DOMESTICATED ANIMALS. NOW THIS BILL TRIES TO BE A REASONABLE BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE FROM ANIMALS THAT ARE USED FOR MEAT SUCH AS QUE HOUSE COWS. OR SHEEP WITH SHEARLING TO BE USE STILL FOR THEIR FOR BECAUSE IT'S MY BELIEF THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO FORM AN ANIMAL YOU SHOULD USE EVERY PART OF THAT ANIMAL. FROM NOSE TO TAIL SO WE TRIED TO IN THE CRAFT A BILL THAT STILL ALLOWS ANIMALS THAT ARE USED FOR ME TO HAVE THEIR HIDES IN THERE FOR USED. FOR CLOTHING. BUT WITH PROP WITH THE ANIMALS THAT ARE EITHER REYES FOR FOUR OR MORE COMMONLY TRAPPED IN THE WILD THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THOSE ANIMALS ARE TAKEN ONLY FOR THEIR PELTS THE REST OF THE ANIMAL IS BASICALLY DISCARDED ARE TREATED AS A WASTE PRODUCT. SO THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT ARE SUFFERING THAT ARE BEING TRAPPED IN THE WILD LEFT IN KEY IN LATE THE HOLDS -- LEFT TO DIE MISERABLY OR WHEN THEY WERE RAISED FOR THE FOR INDUSTRY. KILLED IN A WAY THAT IS NOT REGULATED BY ANY OF OUR LAWS BECAUSE REGULATION AND HOW ANIMALS ARE SLAUGHTERED ARE ONLY GOVERNED FOR FOOD ANIMALS. SO WE HAVE -- CERTAINLY SEEN EVIDENCE OF REALLY HORRIFIC PRACTICES IN THE FOR INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY OVERSEAS BUT DOMESTICALLY AS WELL. OUR CONSUMERS HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY EXPECTED OF CALVET PRODUCT IS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THAT IT'S BEEN HUMANELY RAISED AND SLAUGHTERED WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT WITH THE FOR INDUSTRY SO IT'S TIME THAT WE TAKE. THE LOCAL BANDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN INSTITUTED AND BRING THAT STATEWIDE WHICH I BELIEVE IS IN KEEPING WITH CALIFORNIA'S VALUES. I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT MANY OF OUR LARGEST -- CLOTHING MANUFACTURERS HAVE THEMSELVES GONE FOR FREE. THE REASON IS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM OF TOLD US THAT THEY HAVE GONE TO TRY TO SOURCE HUMANE FOR AROUND THE WORLD AND WHEN THEY DONE THAT AND THEY'VE GONE ON TRIPS TO LOOK AT FOR MANUFACTURERS TO LOOK AT FOR FARMS. THEY HAVE NOT FELT THAT THAT WAS IN KEEPING WITH THEIR VALUES IS A COMPANY THAT THEY COULDN'T GUARANTEE THAT THOSE ANIMALS WERE REYES CRUELTY FREE AND SO THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO FOR AT ALL. NO OTHER THERE ARE A FEW OTHER STATES THAT ARE LOOKING FOR FOR MAN'S BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE LIKE TO LEAD NOT FOLLOW. AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IT'S TIME FOR US TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP IN THE COUNTRY AND SAY THAT AS A STATE WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR FREE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB FORTY FOUR IS PJ SMITH WITH THE HUMANE SOCIETY AND MARCHING IS THE FOUNDER OF ANIMAL HOPING LEGISLATION WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER. PLEASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FRIEDMAN AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS PJ SMITH AND I'M THE FASHION POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB. FORTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF THE HSUS IN OUR SUPPORTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES FOR THIS BILL. FOR A DECADE I'VE WORKED WITH DOZENS OF THE TOP OF PAYROLL COMPANIES FROM TJ MAX THE BURBERRY AND RECENTLY PRADA. TO CREATE POLICIES THAT ARE GOOD FOR THE ANIMALS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN THESE COMPANIES EXAMINE THE FUR TRADE CLOSELY THEY QUICKLY REALIZE THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO HUMANELY SOURCE? FOR AS WELL CONSUMERS ARE REJECTING PRODUCTS ASSOCIATE WITH ANIMAL CRUELTY THIS IS WHY SO MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE NOW GOING FOR FREE. RATHER THAN PREPARE FOR CONSUMERS CHANGING TASTES THE FOR INDUSTRY CHOOSES TO INSTEAD CREATES SMOKE SCREENS TO COVER UP IN MEN SUFFERING IT CAUSES. ITS LATEST GREENWASHING ATTEMPT IS CALLED FOR MARK. UNDER FOR MARK ON DOMESTICATED ANIMALS ARE STILL KRAMDEN BEARING CAGES FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES ANIMALS ARE STILL CAUGHT IN THE WILD IN STEEL LIKE COLD TRANSFER DAYS WITHOUT FOOD WATER. AN ANIMAL STILL DIE BY AN ELECTROCUTION IN FACT THIS IS ONE OF THE PRESCRIBED METHODS OF SLAUGHTER. THE LIST GOES ON AND NUMEROUS INVESTIGATIONS OF A SHOWN THAT CERTIFIED FARMS IS STILL RAMPANT WAS SELF MUTILATION AND BEHAVIORS CALLS BY MEN STRESS IN SUCH FEAR. IN FACT JUST LAST YEAR WHEN THE ITS PRODUCT AS ETHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FRANCES INDEPENDENT ADVERTISING AUTHORITY CLAIMED. THAT THOSE WERE MISLEADING AND ABUSIVE AND EVEN BASED ON LIES NAY ADDED NUMEROUS RELIABLE REPORTS SHOW THAT THE PRODUCTION OF FOR IS EXTREMELY CRUEL INCLUDING AND THAT THE FINAL PRODUCT CONTAINS TALK TO TOXIC SUBSTANCES. CALIFORNIANS CARE ABOUT AND THE ANIMAL WELFARE THEY CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT THEY CARE ABOUT INNOVATION MORE THAN EVER IN BRANDS ARE RESPONDING BY DINT OF DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS TO HAVE THE SAME LOOK AND FEEL AS FOR BUT WITHOUT THE CRUELTY. CALIFORNIA CAN CAPITALIZE ON THIS GROWING MARKET THE FOR INDUSTRY CAN'T TOO WEIRD YOU WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES THANK YOU AYE SIR. NEXT WITNESS. HI MY NAME IS MARCHING FROM ANIMAL OPEN LEGISLACIóN -- WE'RE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORING GROUPS OF THIS BILL -- PART OF OUR HISTORY AS A GROUP IS WE'VE GONE UNDERCOVER INTO FOR FARMS AROUND THE WORLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND FINLAND WHICH IS THE SECOND LARGEST PRODUCER. FOR IN CHINA WHICH IS THE FIRST SET AS WELL AS CANADA. OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THAT WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT. A LOT OF THE VIDEOS SEEN ONLINE ARE FABRICATED OR OUTDATED -- BUT BEING THERE MYSELF I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S NOT. I'VE WITNESSED UNDOCUMENTED AND PUT TOGETHER VIDEOS WHICH REFUSED TO PASS AND BANNED FOR IN A LOS ANGELES. OR THE SHOAL FOX'S BEING ELECTROCUTED. MANY OF THEM STILL ALIVE AS THEIR SKIN -- WE'VE DOCUMENTED FOX FOX'S SCREAMING AS THEIR FOR IS RIPPED OFF OF THEM -- THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD BUT BECAUSE OF THE MASS AMOUNT OF BOXES BEING KILLED THAT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE. WE'VE DOCUMENTED FOR SEND BEATINGS OF THESE FOXES. OF MINK OF RACCOONS OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS USED -- FOR FOR THE LIVE THEIR WHOLE ENTIRE LIVES IN THESE CAGES AND NEVER TOUCH GROUND -- THE THE ANIMALS USE FOR FOR THE FOR INDUSTRY THE MEAT IS NEVER USE SINCE OTHER REYES SOLELY FOR THIS -- AS PJ AND LOWER -- MENTIONED THERE ARE MANY MANY ALTERNATIVES THAT DON'T. INVOLVE THE SUFFERING IN EXTREME TORTURE OF AN ANIMAL. AND WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA IS READY TO GO FOR FREE -- MANY OF THE RETAILERS HAVE AND LOS ANGELES TO SAN FRANCISCO HAS BERKELEY HAS. AND DO WE ASK -- FOR YES VOTE -- LAST THING IS THAT. THE OPPONENTS WILL TRY TO SAY THAT THERE'S AS THEY CAN STANDARDIZE FOR YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT. HUMANELY REGULATED INDUSTRY WHERE ANIMALS ARE TORTURED TO DEATH WHERE THEY'RE SKIN THE LIVES AND THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL. AND WE BELIEVE -- FOR THIS BILL WILL. ATTEND TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND LIKE TO THANK LAURA FOR HER STRONG LEADERSHIP ON THE BILL AND EVERYONE HERE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. I JUST ADD THAT WE TAKEN AMENDMENTS -- TO ADDRESS CONCERNS IN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY FROM PAWNBROKERS FROM SECONDHAND DEALERS FROM THE HUNTING COMMUNITY WE THINK THIS IS A VERY REASONABLE BILL IT ALLOWS FOR THE SALE OF SECOND HAND. FOR AND WON'T INTERFERE WITH HUNTING OR ANY OF THOSE OTHER USES. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. NAME AND AFFILIATION.

GOOD MORNING SENATORS ARE MY NAME IS EDWIN LOMBARD I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE LARGEST BLACK BUSINESS ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE BLACK BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. WHICH IS THE OLDEST BLACK BUSINESS ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE TO URGE A NO VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL. FORTY FOUR IN ADDITION TO BEING. A NEEDLESS ATTACK ON LEGAL HIGHLY REGULATED JOB PRODUCING INDUSTRY. IT'S ALSO AN AFFRONT TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. IN AN ERA WHEN BLACK AMERICANS WERE PAID LESS FOR THE SAME JOB FACING REDLINING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. COULDN'T GET LOANS TO START BUSINESSES SAVING UP FOR AND BUYING A FOR A WAS A WAY OF SHOWING THAT WE COULD OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS. FOR HAS MUCH OF THE SAME CULTURAL IMPACTS ON AFRICAN AMERICANS AS IT DOES ON NATIVE AMERICANS AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS. WHICH THEY BOTH HAVE BEEN GIVEN PASSED BY AB FORTY FOUR BUT NOT US. LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING MOST OF ALL. WE'RE NOT ASKING THE SENATE TO KILL AB FORTY FOUR BECAUSE IT. DOESN'T INCLUDE US WERE ASKING TO STOP IT BECAUSE OF BAD ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT IT WOULD HAVE ON EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE FUR INDUSTRY IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE INDUSTRIES THAT REYES BEEF. CHICKEN PORK LAMB NOT ONLY FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION BT ALSO FOR THE BY PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDE US LED THE GOODS GARMENTS. AND MEDICAL RESEARCH. SINCE WHEN DO WE KILL CENTURY OLD LEGAL AND HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRIES BY LEGISLATIVE FIAT. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE BEING VOTING WHICH ARE VOTING ON TODAY. WHETHER TO ADVANCE A FIRST OF THE NATION'S BILL TO DISSEMINATE JOBS AND TAX REVENUE SOLELY TO PLEASE THE POLITICAL WHIMS OF A DISTANT MINORITY OF ACTIVISTS OF ACTIVISTS. ON WHETHER TO STOP A HORRENDOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION FROM GOING ANY FURTHER. I MUST SAY THAT THERE IS A SLAP IN THE FACE THING THAT MAKES AB FORTY FOUR EVEN WORSE. AS JASMINE SANDERS ROLE. IN THE NEW YORK TIMES ABOUT BLACK WOMEN LIVE IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. IT WAS A NEAR OF SEGREGATION JIM CROW LAW RED LINING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. SO SAVING ENOUGH TO PURCHASE A COSTLY FOR COAL. WAS A WAY OF SHOWING THAT THEY COULD OVERCOME THE BARRIERS OF ANY QUALITY. IT WAS ALSO A WAY OF PRESENTING AN ASPIRATIONAL IMAGE WILD. A CHALLENGING THE STEREO TYPES AND PERCEPTIONS OF BLACK LIFE. THERE IS A SENSE AMONG MANY BLACK WOMEN THAT A BROADER. CULTURAL DISAPPROVAL. FOR HAS COINCIDE. OVER OUR INCREASED ABILITY TO PURCHASE IT. OR AS PAUL MARIE SENIORS A CITIZEN A HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR AT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES AT VIRGINIA TECH WORLD. OUR MOTHER USED TO SAY AS SOON AS A BLACK WOMEN COULD AFFORD IT TO BUY A MAIN COLD WHITESOCIETY AND WHITE WOMEN SAID. FOR WAS WRONG. FOR WOMEN LIKE MY MOTHER GRANDMOTHER AUNTS SISTERS A FUR COAT IS MORE THAN A PERSONAL LUXURY. IT'S AN EMOTIONAL INVESTMENT. WE GIVE OUR U. S. SENATORS. LONG TERM OFFICES SO THAT THEY CAN THEORETICALLY BE MORE DELIVER WILL DELIVER IT AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THAT CONSERVE HOLDS UP. THERE FOR ASKS FOR A NO VOTE ON A. B.. FORTY FOUR THANK YOU SIR PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO ALLOW ME TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS KEITH KAPLAN I'M WITH THE FUR INFORMATION COUNCIL AMERICA. AND I HAVE TO BEGIN BY SAYING TRUTH MATTERS THAT MATTERS TO ME AND I DO BELIEVE IS OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS OF MATTERS TO YOU AND WHAT YOU'VE BEEN FED BY THE SPONSORS TODAY IS ANYTHING BUT THE SITTING A LIVE VIDEO HAS BEEN DISPROVED WOMEN'S WEAR DAILY WROTE EXTENSIVE ARTICLE. ON THIS THEY HOLD THE AFFIDAVITS FROM THE PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE PAID BY THE ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP TO CONDUCT THESE HEINOUS ACTIVITIES ON ANIMALS TO SUPPORT THE NARRATIVE. THAT WOULD PUSH THIS CAMPAIGN FORWARD. AND AS FAR AS THE GERMAN HSUS COMMENTING ON THE FOR MARCH CERTIFICATION PROGRAM HE CLEARLY HAS NOT READ NOR UNDERSTANDS THIS PROGRAM WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AT THE TABLE WITH ALL OF THE MAJOR FASHION BRANDS AROUND THE WORLD. TO ME THEIR GUIDELINES FOR SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ETHICAL SOURCING IT IS THE V. MOST COMPREHENSIVE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM OF ANY ANIMAL USE INDUSTRY. EMPLOYS THIRD PARTY MONITORING EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE CATTLE INDUSTRY AND IT USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO GUARANTEE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY. BUT I'M NOT HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO KILL AB. FORTY FOUR IN FACT I'M HERE TODAY IS TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY IT WON'T RESULT IN ANY POSITIVE MOVEMENT ON ANIMAL WELFARE AND WHY THE AMENDMENT THAT WE PROPOSED. FOR FOR MARCH CERTIFICATION PROGRAM DOES MORE TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE BILL'S AUTHOR. FIRST OF ALL OF THE LUXURY SECTOR BUYERS AREN'T LIMITED GEOGRAPHICALLY IF THEY WANT TO PRODUCT AND THEY CAN'T BITE WHERE THEY ARE LOCAL WHERE THEY CAN. LOOK AT RODEO DRIVE LOOK AT UNION SQUARE AND THE INFLUX OF FOREIGN BUYERS. PEOPLE WHO WANT FOR WILL BUY IT WHEREVER THEY CAN. AND THAT'S THE POINT. IF THEY WANTED BILL BY IT. THIS BILL WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ANIMALS. BANDS REALLY HURT THE LEGITIMATE GUY MOST HE'S THE GUY THAT FOLLOWS THE RULES DOESN'T BREAK THE LAW. HE IS THE ONE YOU'RE PUTTING OUT OF BUSINESS AND IN SO DOING YOUR FOSTERING THE GROWTH OF THE ILLEGITIMATE MARKET THE ONE THAT DOESN'T FOLLOW THE RULES OR PLAYED BY THE LAW. YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH CANNABIS YOU AGREED THAT REGULATION WAS THE BEST WAY TO CLOSE ON THOSE BLACK MARKETS WHY DOESN'T THAT APPLY HERE. HERE IN ENCOURAGING ILLEGITIMATE MARKET YOU CAN BET THOSE GUYS WON'T BE THE ONES CONCERNED WITH ANY KIND OF ANIMAL WELFARE GUIDELINES. EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL ALLOW FOR THE SALE OF FOR FROM CERTAIN ANIMALS AND THE USE OF FOR BY CERTAIN CULTURAL GROUPS. BUT WITHOUT ANY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE APPLICATION OF ANY KIND OF ANIMAL WELFARE STANDARDS. WHEN THE CONSUMER GOES TO BY THE FOR PRODUCT ALLOWED UNDER THESE EXEMPTIONS YOU CAN BET HE'S GONNA LOOK AT THE PRICE POINTS AND PURCHASED THE LEAST EXPENSIVE PRODUCT? AND YOU CAN BET THAT PRODUCT WILL BE THE ONE THE COST AT LEAST TO PRODUCE AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. PROBABLY THE LOWER STANDARDS OF ANIMAL CARE AND FEEDING. SO YOU HAVE ACHIEVED EXACTLY WHAT YOU SET OUT NOT TO DO. THIS IS. A IN THE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WILL PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. THE MAN THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO MISS FREEMAN'S OFFICE. AT FOR CERTIFICATION PROGRAM THAT COVERS BOTH FARMS AND WILD. FOR IT WILL REQUIRE ANY FIRST SOLD OR MANUFACTURED IN CALIFORNIA MUST BE CERTIFIED. THROUGH A PROGRAM THAT IS THIRD PARTY AND INDEPENDENTLY MONITORED NOW THE WOMAN WHO WANTS TO BUY A FOR COULD GO BITE ON RODEO DRIVE. RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO LAS VEGAS AND THE PRODUCERS OF THE FOR SHE BUYS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE TO OF HAD APPEARED. TO THE A VERY IMPORTANT ANIMAL WELFARE STANDARDS REQUIRED UNDER CERTIFICATION WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE IN LAS VEGAS. YOU'VE DONE THE JOB. THE ANIMAL LOVER. WE ACTUALLY HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON AND ON AND WILL FOR BEEN DOING THIS AND FOR THE EXEMPTED USES. THE EXEMPTIONS SANDERS THE LESS EXPENSIVE OPTIONS A COULD BE SOLDIER UNDER THE EXEMPTIONS THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED ANYMORE. SO AGAIN YOU'VE ACHIEVED SOMETHING POSITIVE AND MR LOMBARDS. NOTES ABOUT THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY FOR WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO AS LONG AS IT WAS CERTIFIED. AB FORTY FOUR HAS SOME SERIOUS FLAWS BUT THE AMENDMENT THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO MISS FREEMAN'S OFFICE THE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM MAKES IT A STRONGER BILL BY CLOSING LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOW. OR ENCOURAGE THE SALE OF PRODUCTS WITH OUT APPLICATIONS STRICTER BETTER ANIMAL WELFARE PRACTICES I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE AMENDMENT.

THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- MY NAME IS IS FINDING I AM FROM FREMONT CALIFORNIA AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TOO MANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] SEEING NONE -- SORRY. WE'LL GO SENATE JACKSON AND SENATOR GORGEOUS YES I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY PEOPLE NEED TO WEAR. FOR MY MOTHER USED TO HAVE A FOR MY GRANDMOTHER HAD A FOR TODAY WE HAVE MATERIALS THAT CAN KEEP YOU WARM WITHOUT USING FOR BUT THAT BEING SAID -- I KNOW THAT IN THE PARTICULARLY THE NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE THERE IS SOMETHING MORE. TO THE PROCESS AND WANTING TO WEAR FOR INTO THE SLAUGHTER ANIMALS SO I'M WONDERING HAVE YOU CONSIDERED PERHAPS TAKING AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD. OR IF YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN A BECAUSE I APOLOGIZE I'VE BEEN ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT RECOGNIZES IN SOME INSTANCES THERE IS A CULTURAL LARA RELIGIOUS OR ANOTHER TRADITIONAL ASPECT TO IT. NOT THAT I WOULD NECESSARILY DO THAT BUT I WANT TO RESPECT. OTHER CULTURES WHERE THIS IS NOT JUST SO MUCH TO SEE IF YOU CAN. SHOWOFF YOUR FANCY FOR TO YOUR FRIENDS -- THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- A SECTION SEE THREE SPECIFICALLY EXAMS NATIVE AMERICAN -- ACTIVITIES OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A TIME THERE WAS A TIME WHEN. FOR DID PROTECT PEOPLE AND KEEP THE MORMON I SUPPORT THAT NOTION THAT WE REALLY -- IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AGAIN I JUST -- I FIND IT TROUBLESOME TO THINK THE WE REALLY NEED TO TO ENGAGE IN THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR -- BUT THERE WAS ONE POINT THAT WAS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION AYE I WOULD LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO THE NOTION THAT THERE ARE. IF YOU WILL GOOD GOOD ACTORS AND BAD ACTORS IN THIS INDUSTRY AND WHILE WOULD ONLY BE BANNING THIS HEARING CALIFORNIA WHICH MEANS THAT OTHER STATES COULD CONTINUE WITH THIS BEHAVIOR -- THERE HAS BEEN IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY A HIGHER STANDARD OR FOR THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY GROUP. THAT WOULD BE THREATENED -- BY A BY OUR EFFORT HERE EVEN THOUGH I'D LIKE A THE FACT WERE FIRST IN A LOT OF GREAT THINGS AND LEAD THE COUNTRY. I JUST WONDER IF THE THAT MIGHT CREATE SOME KIND OF A COMPROMISE SITUATION -- FOR FOR THOSE WHO INSIST UPON. UP PRODUCING -- FOR IF FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO WERE TRYING TO DO IT IN THE MOST HUMANE. WAY POSSIBLE TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A HUMANE WAY COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT CONCERT. THANK YOU SENATOR IF I UNDERSTAND THE COURT QUESTION CORRECTLY IT'S ABOUT -- STILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AND PURCHASE FOR ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WHICH IS CERTAINLY TRUE UNDER THIS BILL I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE HAD A LOT OF THE SAME ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE COSMETIC TESTING. AND OTHER COSMETIC RELATED -- THE ISSUES AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS INSTEAD OF PUSHING THOSE INDUSTRIES OUT OF THE STATE EIGHT OTHERSTATES AT THIS POINT HAVE FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD. AND ADOPTED THE SAME POLICIES I'M CREATING JUST NATURALLY MORE OF A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WE HAVE ALSO HEARD THE SAME ARGUMENT WHEN IT CAME TO GETTING CHICKENS ARE A BEARING CHICKENS. MORE ROOM AND GIVING FARM ANIMALS ARE MORE HUMANE STANDARDS AND THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS WHEN THIS HAS GONE ON THE BALLOT OVER AND OVER AGAIN HAVE SAID. YOU KNOW OUR CONCERN IS LESS WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT WE WANT TO KNOW THAT IF WE PURCHASE A PRODUCT IN CALIFORNIA. THEN IT IS CRUELTY FREE AS POSSIBLE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE CAN. WE CAN DO THAT WITH THIS INDUSTRY GIVEN THE PLACES WERE A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED WHICH IS IN CHINA AS THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCTION -- COUNTRY FOR FOR AND I WOULD. IS SAY THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE COUNTRIES EVEN FOR APPLE WITH THEIR PHONES WE'VE HEARD ABOUT A LOT OF ABUSIVE WERE ABUSIVE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT AND HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANIMALS AND TRYING TO POLICE THAT -- SO -- AND AND SECONDLY JUST BY THEIR NATURE. ANIMALS THAT ARE NOT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS ARE WILD ANIMALS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP INTACT CAPTIVITY. I REPRESENT THE LA ZOO IN MY DISTRICT THEY SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR TRYING TO DO FOR FILM AND FOR THOSE ANIMALS BECAUSE THEIR WILD ANIMALS THAT NEED TO MOVE THAT NEED TO ROME. OTHERWISE THEY DO THIS FOR A DISPLAY STRESSED BEHAVIOR WITH THESE ANIMALS KEPT IN SMALL CAGES THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT IN A HUMANE WAY. SO I GUESS THE THAT THE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING CLEAR AND THE QUESTION WAS SENT OUT MY UNDERSTANDING WAS WAS IT AND SOMEBODY TESTIFYING ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THERE IS A GROUP. THAT ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE AS HUMANE AS POSSIBLE IN THEIR TREATMENT OF THESE ANIMALS SO I THEY'RE SORT OF THE MID THE MID WAY GROUP BETWEEN KNOLL. OF PRODUCTION AND OR KILLING AND TRYING TO BE POLITE ABOUT THIS BUT AND IN DOING IT AS HUMANELY AS POSSIBLE SO I MISUNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE CONCERNS ABOUT FOR HAVE BEEN REYES. FOR DECADES NOW WE'VE HEARD WE HAD ANTI FOR CAMPAIGNS IN THIS COUNTRY FOR DECADES AND YET WE DON'T HAVE THAT PROGRAM WE DON'T HAVE IT THAT ASSURANCE WHY AT THIS MOMENT ARE THEY OFFERING THAT WHEN THEY'VE HAD FIFTY YEARS OF PEOPLE RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT. FOR FROM THE DAYS THAT IT CAME OUT THAT BABY SEALS WERE CLUBBED TO DEATH UNTIL NOW. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF TWENTY YEARS AGO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED AND EVERY FOR THAT WAS PURCHASED IN CALIFORNIA HAD THAT CERTIFICATION IT DIDN'T AND SO WE ARE WE ARE TODAY. AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE SHOULD ACT ON THIS NOW THE WAY THAT LOS ANGELES HAS AND SAN FRANCISCO HAS AND BRING UNIFORMITY TO THIS TO THE STATE. JACKSON CENTER BORDERS. GERMAN -- I THINK -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- SANTA BARBARA WAS GOING ON LINE OF QUESTIONING THAT I INTENDED TO AS WELL -- MAYBE I'LL POSE MY QUESTION. TO JOHN THAT TALKED ABOUT -- INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF OF OF ANIMALS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL TITLE IS. BUT IS THERE NOT AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. FOR LEGISLATION TO BE AMENDED THAT WOULD MANDATE -- THE APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANDARDS IN SUCH A WAY THAT -- WOULD SATISFY THE CONCERNS OR MOST OF THE CONCERNS RAISED. ABOUT. THE IN HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. TO ME I'LL SERVICE. THE ANSWER IF I MAY. THANK YOU SO THE THE FIRST ANSWER THE QUESTION IS IS YES THIS PROGRAM HAS A BIT BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE COURSE OF LAST FOR FIVE YEARS AGAIN WITH THE MAJOR BRANDS OF THE TABLE. USING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS BASED ON VETERINARY SCIENCE IN THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO US TODAY AND THOSE ARE CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AND THE CONCEPT IS THAT THE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WOULD BE SIMILARLY CONTINUALLY EVOLVING -- THE FOR THE THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT MONITORING AS I SAID IS THE SAME PROGRAM THAT IS IN PLACE FOR THE CATTLE INDUSTRY THIS ACCEPTED. PRETTY UNIVERSALLY AND IT IT USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY SO THAT THE PELTS OF A YOU GO TO BUY GARMENT AND THAT G DE UP OF A NUMBER OF PELTS EVERYONE WILL HAVE A BAR CODE. AND YOU CAN GO FIRST OF ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE FARM TO GUARANTEE THE FARMING PRACTICES AND THE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION THROUGH DRESSING AND DYING WHICH BY THE WAY USES -- IF THE DOES NOT USE THE CHEMICALS THEY SAY IT DOESN'T USE VEGETABLE DYES SO Y THE WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR AND FROM OTHERS IS THAT -- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FROM -- THESE THIRD COUNTRIES -- BUT SIMPLY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED IN IF THEY DIDN'T MEET SANDERS AND AND THAT'S WHAT I'M OF THE TIME WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THAT YOU KNOW. CERTAIN FURS ARE OF DUBIOUS ORIGIN WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE FROM -- HOW THEY WERE -- PROCESS SO AND SO FORTH -- SO WOULD NOT BE IN A MIDDLE POSES TO THE AUTHOR. I KNOW THAT MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A WHILE BACK -- BUT IS THIS NOT ALSO A WAY FORWARD OF FOR YOU TO SATISFY SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE CONSTITUENCY THAT CARES ABOUT THIS ATTER PARTICULAR -- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STANDARDS -- MAYBE THIS WOULD BE IN A MORE APPROPRIATE WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO MOVE THE NATION -- EN MANDATE THAT THE IMPORTS ARE COMPLIANT WITH INTERNATIONAL SET OF NORMS. WOULD THAT NOT BE BETTER POLICY THANK YOU SENATOR I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE. SORT OF HELP. TRYING TO HELP -- MAKE SURE THAT -- THE ANIMALS ARE PROTECTED I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT I'M GONNA ASK THE HUMANE SOCIETY TO RESPOND BECAUSE THEY'VE DEALT WITH -- FOR MARK FOR AWHILE. THANK YOU -- THE STANDARDS THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT ARE EXTREMELY JUST SELF REGULATED -- IT'S REALLY JUST A LOT OF MARKETING -- THAT GOES INTO IT. THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO FOR FARMS ARE AN ELECTROCUTION AND YOU CAN AS A GENTLEMAN -- IT IS IT IS OKAY UNDER FOR MARK IN OTHER THE BEST. CERTIFIED FARMS OUT THERE THE SAME WITH TRAPPING MEAN TRAPPING IS A STEEL LOG STEEL JOE LEGAL TRAP THAT HOLDEN ANIMAL FOR DAYS THIS IS APPROVED UNDER FOR MARK. AS WELL AS JUST AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN MENTIONS I MEAN THE PROBLEMS OF HAVING A ON DOMESTICATED WILD ANIMAL IN A CAGE -- THE JUST THE STRESS AND THE FEAR THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. DIFFERENT FROM OTHER SUPPLY CHAINS -- LIKE LEATHER AND SHEEP SO LET'S LET'S ASSUME THAT. ALL THESE MISS TREATMENTS OCCUR IN OUR COMMON LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT FOR A MOMENT. WOULD IT NOT BE MORE HELPFUL. TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA -- PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT GIVES MORE TEETH. MORE A MORE ROBUST SET OF REGULATIONS TO A BODY THAT ALREADY EXISTS BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE BEEN ALSO HEARD IS. WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT -- FOR THIS LEGISLATION ON DOING -- THIS -- THIS AREA OF SALE -- BECAUSE NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVING A STRONG ECONOMIC IMPACT ON ON BUSINESSES -- SO WITHOUT KNOWING IN QUAN AND HAVING SOMEONE QUANTIFY. HOW MANY BUSINESSES MICHAEL WONDER FOR THIS? LIKE ARE WE JUST KIND OF WE MISSING MISSING THAT THE BALL HERE LOOK IT SEEMS AS IF THERE THIS IS A WAY FORWARD -- WITHOUT. HAVING OUT RIGHT BAN I CAN QUANTIFY THE ECONOMIC STAKE SO I'M SORRY WAS THAT A QUESTION THE AUTHOR YOU KNOW MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE IT'S NOT I JUST I THINK I THINK -- IF THE EXAMPLES THAT AND I'M LEARNING ABOUT THIS I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THE THAT THE TREATMENT OF THESE ANIMALS BUT IF IT IS BAD AS IT SOUNDS. AND THERE IS A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN PLACE THAT NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED OR MADE MORE ROBUST. THAT COULD BE A WAY FORWARD WITHOUT COMPLETELY ON DOING AN INDUSTRY. IT DOESN'T SHE AND I AM DOUBTFUL THAT IT WOULD ACHIEVE THE RESULTS THAT EVERYONE WANTS IF THEY REALLY CAN'T GO TO ARIZONA AND NEVADA. AND PURCHASE THE SAME GOODS -- YOU'RE JUST TAKING THE BUSINESSES OUT OF CALIFORNIA BUT NOT THE ACTUAL TRIP -- END USER LET ME JUST -- ALL THIS QUICKLY SAY TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE NOT OFFERING A CERTIFICATION THAT GIVES US CONFIDENCE THAT THESE ANIMALS WILL BE RAISED OR SLAUGHTERED CRUELTY FREE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE FURNITURE CAN'T DO THAT OR IS PREPARED. EVEN PUT THAT ON THE TABLE SO THEY HAVEN'T COME TO US WITH THAT SORT OF SET OF REGULATIONS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AS YOU JUST HEARD. THOSE TO THE GREGIS PRACTICES CAN STILL CONTINUE EVEN UNDER THE CERTIFICATION SECONDLY IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT. WHO'S NOT BEEN IN THEROOM ADVOCATING AGAINST THIS BILL OUR OUR MAJOR RETAILERS. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM BLOOMINGDALE'S WE'VE NOT HEARD FOR MACY'S WE'VE NOT HEARD FROM ANY OF THESE STORED SAYING THAT THIS IS A HARDSHIP FOR THEM RIGHT NOW IN LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCISCO OR THE OTHER CITIES THAT DON'T ALLOW. FOR YOU ALSO IF YOU ARE A FIRST SIR SELLER YOU CAN STILL UNDER THIS BILL SELL SHEARLING WHICH COMES IN A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF OF FOR TYPES AND COLORS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. PRODUCTS MADE OUT OF COW FOR AN OTHER DOMESTICATED ANIMALS GOAT SO THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR THOSE SALES -- AND SO I I AGREE WITH YOU WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT ECONOMIC IMPACT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GOING TO CAUSE A BIG ECONOMIC IMPACT ARE THERE SOME FOR YEARS THAT YOU KNOW WILL BE LIMITED IN WHAT THEY SELL. YES OF COURSE THERE WILL BUT WE HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE A LINE OF RETAILERS OUT THE DOOR TELLING US THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AT ALL HARMFUL FOR THEM. AND CLOTHING SALES IN LOS ANGELES OUR BELIEVE ME I LIVE THERE ARE STILL VERY STRONG. SO THERE'S A WE ARE MOTION FROM SENATOR JACKSON -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SEEING NONE -- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY -- AND JUST A COUPLE BRIEF COMMENTS NOT TO ARGUE YOUR POINTS. BUT I DO USE THE INTERNATIONAL CATTLE. STANDARDS AS THE AS OUR GOLD STANDARD TO ME I DON'T. TRUST THE INTERNATIONAL BEEF INDUSTRIES TREATING THEIR CATTLE HUMANELY IN CHINA SO. AND AND WHEN IT COMES TO CANNABIS. NO ONE DIES WHEN YOU HARVEST THE CANNABIS PLANT NIGHT. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS FOR MARK -- BUT CAN WE GET CONFIRMATION FOR THE RECORD OF AROUND THE TECHNIQUES OF TRYING TO BE APPLIED SO ANAL EXECUTION ALLOWED AND STILL DRAW TRAPPING ALLOWED. THERE'S A VERY LONG LIST OF VETERINARY APPROVED METHODS OF EUTHANASIA FOR DIFFERENT SPECIES IT'S DETERMINED BY SCIENCE. MAY NOT SOUND GREAT TO US SITTING IN THE ROOM BUT IT RESULTS IN THE LEAST STRESS ON THE ANIMAL AND THE QUICKEST DEMISE FOR THE ANIMAL. BUT SO THE ANSWER IS JUST YES ON THOSE THOSE FRONTS. THE FIRST ONE IS PRESCRIBED PERSON FOR CERTAIN SPECIES VERY LIMITED THE SECOND STILL PUBLIC TRUST BEST MANAGED BY BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES INTERNATIONALLY DON'T ALLOW IT. VERY GOOD WELL I I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS -- AND AND THE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY I I ALSO KNOW NOTED IN IN THAT SECTION THREE AROUND NATIVE AMERICAN USES ALSO SECONDHAND SO. THOSE WHO STILL CULTURALLY DESIRE TO HAVE THAT FASHION OPTION I WOULDN'T UP FOR THAT -- BUT THOSE WHO DO. OPT FOR IT I THINK THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT -- SHOULD HOPEFULLY SAYS WHY THAT CULTURAL DESIRE -- AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE BY IS. OUR VALUES HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY IN THIS STATE AND WHAT OUR LAWS ARE ARE HOW WE FEEL IS A STATE ABOUT. HOW WE TREAT ANIMALS AND THOSE WITHOUT? LOBBYISTS AND WHO HAVE NO VOICES -- YOU KNOW WHAT THE REST THE WORLD DOES HOPEFULLY THEY FOLLOW SUIT -- BUT WE CAN ONLY DO WHAT'S IN OUR POWER TODAY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS FORD -- AND WITH THAT IT ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO VERY BRIEFLY RESPOND TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE BLACK CHAMBERS ARGUMENTS -- AND I WOULD JUST POINT YOU ALL TO THE COMMENTS THAT THE IMMEDIATE PAST CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS WHAT HE THOUGHT CHRIS HOLDEN WHAT HIS RESPONSE WAS WHEN HE HEARD THE SAME ARGUMENTS. IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE WHICH WAS THAT HE FOUND THOSE ARGUMENTS TO BE DEEPLY OFFENSIVE. AND IF ANYBODY IS INTERESTED IN HEARING HIS RATIONALE ABOUT THAT I DO POINT YOU TO HIS VERY COMPELLING AND VERY OUTRAGE TESTIMONY -- THEM WITHOUT I WOULD REQUEST FULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO THEM THE MOTION IS DO PASS. TO JUDICIARY -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CENTERS STERN AYE STERN I'D JONES NO JONES NO ALLEN. BURGESS. FORGES NO COVER EURO HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON JACKSON NINE MONEY. MONEY NINE THE HAS THREE IT'S ON CALL OKAY SO WE WILL LEAVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THAT'S A THREE TWO VOTE RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TEST YEAH -- ROLL OVER THE REMAINING READ THAT WITH ME I'D BE HAPPY TO THERE SHOULD BE. A LITTLE BIT HAPPIER AND IS MORE EASILY DECIDES. FOR CGA SO OFFICES YEAH [inaudible] SO [inaudible] TRY. TO WHEN WAS THE AND THE BILL AS WELL -- ALL RIGHT.

TEN YES SO -- ELEVEN ELEVEN YES I'M ACCEPTING THE MODIFICATION OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS -- AB ELEVEN ELEVEN CREATES A NEW OFFICE ABOUT A RECREATION FOR CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THIS IS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUTDOOR RECREATION IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY NAMIK DRIVER IN OUR STATE AND COULD BE EVEN MORE SO IN SOME OF OUR RURAL AREAS. THAT REALLY NEED THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS BUT DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROMOTE THEIR AREAS AS WELL WE HAVE STATED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE THAT WE REALLY WANT TO GET DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES INTO THE OUTDOORS. AND THIS BILL WOULD HELP COORDINATE ALL OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE DIFFERENT OFFICES FROM FISH AND WILDLIFE -- TO YOU NATURAL RESOURCES THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES THAT ALL OUR TASK WOULD SORT OF SIMILAR -- GOALS BUT THERE IS NO CENTRAL COORDINATION BETWEEN THOSE OFFICES TO WORK WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO GET PEOPLE OUT. OUTDOORS RECREATION -- WE ARE BRINGING OUR WITNESSES IN RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT WITNESSES FROM ARI I AND FROM THE CALIFORNIA OUTDOOR RECREATION PARTNERSHIP. AND THEY'RE HERE TO TELL YOU WHY THEY THINK THIS BILL IS A GREAT IDEA. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIMELY APPEARANCE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- TWO MINUTES EACH [inaudible] RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR STERN AND MEMBERS ON KATIE HAWKINS ON THE CALIFORNIA ORGANIZER FOR THE OUTDOOR ALLIANCE I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI. ELEVEN ELEVEN OTHER ALLIANCE IS A NONPROFIT COALITION MEMBERS BASED ORGANIZATION INCLUDING ACCESS FUND. AMERICAN WHITEWATER SURFRIDER FOUNDATION THE INTERNATIONAL MOUNTAIN BIKE ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS WE REPRESENT THE FAST GROWING HUMAN POWERED OUTDOOR RECREATION COMMITTEE AND THE INTERESTS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO CLIMBED PADDLE MOUNTAIN BIKES BACK COUNTRY SKI SNOWBOARD? AND SNOWSHOEING ENJOY THE CULTURE RECREATION WATER SINCE NETSCAPE THE CALIFORNIA. HOW TO ALLIANCE REPRESENTS TWENTY THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS PLUS DOZENS OF GRASS ROOTS GROUPS? OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE THE SURFRIDER ADS IN THE BEACH THE ROCK CLIMBER IN INYO NATIONAL FOREST FROM THE PEDDLER AT THE AMERICAN RIVER. TO THE MOUNTAIN BIKER WHISKEYTOWN NATIONAL RECREATION AREA. OUR MEMBERS PARTNERS IN LOCAL GROUPS SORRY. I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT THE MANY CHALLENGES INFERIORS TRYING TO WORK ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENCIES TEMPER PUBLIC ACCESS TO CREATE VOLUNTEER STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE INFRASTRUCTURE. NEEDS ON PUBLIC LANDS AND MAINTAIN TRAILS THEY NEED YOUR HELP. CREATING IN A CALIFORNIA STATE OFFICE OF RECREATION WILL BE A HUGE STEP FOR TODAY ENSURING SUSTAINABLE AND ECO NOT. EQUITABLE RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIANS FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT THIS IS A NECESSARY INVESTMENT. OUR PUBLIC LANDS AND WATERS ALMOST HALF OF WHICH ARE FEDERALLY MANAGED AND HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MANAGED WITH MINIMAL COORDINATION WITH STATE AGENCIES IN SACRAMENTO. ARE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS OUR NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLAR OUTDOOR RECREATION ECONOMY THE SINGING SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND DIRECT JOBS. IN GENERATED SIX POINT TWO BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE. THE ALTAR REGARD REPRESENT A MAJORITY OF OUR CARBON SEQUESTERING RESOURCES IN A STATE WHERE WE HAVE MADE CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION FORCE HEALTH AND RESILIENCE AND FUNDAMENTAL PRIORITIES. CALIFORNIA STATE OFFICE OF RECREATION WILL BRING UNNECESSARY AND OVERDUE HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE TO STATEWIDE PUBLIC LANDS AND RECREATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION PLAYING YOUR SUPPORT ON AB ELEVEN ELEVEN THANK YOU MUCH. WELCOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MARK BREAKER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY FAIRS FOR ARI I COOPER. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB. ELEVEN ELEVEN REI'S BEEN A CALIFORNIA BUSINESS SINCE WE OPENED OUR SECOND EVER STORE IN BERKELEY IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WE NOW HAVE TWENTY EIGHT STORES TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND ALMOST FOUR MILLION COOP MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO GIVE BACK LATELY SORRY I HIS GIVEN ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TO DOZENS OF NOT FOR PROFIT NOT FOR PROFITS. INCLUDING FRIENDS OF THE LA RIVER. AND NGOS THAT ARE DIVERSIFYING THE OUTDOORS LIKE AFTER AFRO AND LATINO OUTDOORS. OUR SHARED LOVE OF THE OUTDOORS IS CENTRAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ANTI REI'S HERITAGE AND TO OUR FUTURE. THERE'S EXTRAORDINARY DEMAND FOR THE OUTDOORS ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY 56% OF CALIFORNIANS GET OUTSIDE AT LEAST. GET INTO THE OUTDOORS AT LEAST ONCE PER YEAR. BUT WE NEED TO DO BETTER. KIDS NOWADAYS SPEND SEVEN HOURS A DAY IN FRONT OF SCREENS ADULTS SPEND ELEVEN HOURS A DAY IN FRONT OF SCREENS. MEANWHILE HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE APPROACHING 18% OF GDP. RATING OPPORTUNITIES TO GET INTO THE OUTDOORS IS GOOD FOR OUR WELL BEING. IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR JOBS AND FOR THE ECONOMY. OUTDOOR COMPANIES I SUBMIT ARE PART OF CALIFORNIA'S INNOVATION AND GREEN JOBS MOVEMENT. THE RECREATION OFFICE THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING WILL CULTIVATE THOSE INNOVATORS HELP FILL TALENT PIPELINES AND OF ALL OF THESE COMPANIES INTERNATIONAL BRANDS. MOREOVER CALIFORNIA HAS GREAT RURAL TOWNS WITH RECREATION POTENTIAL THAT'S NOT FULLY REALIZED THIS OFFICE WOULD HELP THESE TOWNS REACH THEIR POTENTIAL. FINALLY THE OFFICE WOULD HELP THE STATE AGENCIES TO CARE ABOUT THE OUTDOORS WORK BETTER TOGETHER. WE WOULD CREATE GOVERNMENTAL EFFICIENCIES FROM HEALTH CARE AGENCIES TO EDUCATION THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOURISM AND ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF TIME OUTDOORS. THIS OFFICE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THOSE AGENCIES ARE COORDINATED AND GETTING THE MAXIMUM SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM TIME OUTDOORS. THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING AB ONE ELEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER ELEVEN OUR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS MERION WARMER DAM ON BEHALF OF RURAL COUNTIES IF I MIGHT TAKE ONE ADDITIONAL COMMENT.

HELLO NOT HER MOMMA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RECREATION PARK DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT THANKS SO MUCH. ALRIGHT SEEN NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION SEEING. NINE I HAVE TO STEP OUT SOME TO MAKE ONE BRIEF COMMENT AND HAND THE GAVEL TO MY VICE CHAIR -- APPRECIATE YOU BRING A BILL FOR THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS MY QUESTION WAS TO TO OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS YOU KNOW WE WE STRUGGLE THIS YEAR -- TO GET ANY FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY ACCESS AND AND FAILED IN THAT EFFORT IN THE BUDGET AT A PROP SIXTY EIGHT OTHERWISE WE JUST HELD A SURF SUMMIT -- IN MY DISTRICT OVER THE WEEKEND WHERE. ABOUT A HUNDRED KIDS FROM ALL OVER LOS ANGELES SHOWED UP AT THE BEACH FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN THEIR ENTIRE LIVES -- BUT THERE WAS NO MONEY TO DO THAT WE HAD TO SCRAMBLE TOGETHER A BUNCH OF VOLUNTEERS AND GET IT YOU KNOW SEARCH FOR THE CITY TO SPONSOR. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE FROM INDUSTRY WHAT DO YOU ALL ALREADY INVESTING IN IMPROVING THIS ACCESS WITHOUT SOME NEW OFFICER PUBLIC FUNDS HOW MUCH IS BEING INVESTED. INTO BRINGING ACCESS TO THOSE WHO LACK IT TO THESE OUTDOOR RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES NOW IN CALIFORNIA GIVE IT. TO A BALL PARKER SENSE OF SORT OF WHAT WHAT YOU ALL ARE DOING EITHER AT OUR YEAH YOU'RE BORN BROADLY. I CAN SPEAK FOR ARE A I AND I I DO KNOW THAT THE INDUSTRY IS MADE UP OF VERY -- A WIDE ARRAY OF COMPANIES MANY OF WHICH ARE SMALL AND DO THEIR BEST TO BE PHILANTHROPIC. ARI I MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BIGGER COMPANIES OR ANNUAL PHILANTHROPIC BUDGET IS EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WHICH I OVERSEE. AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR NET NET BOTTOM LINE AFTER DIVIDEND WAS FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROFIT SO OUR PHILANTHROPY AMOUNTS -- 220% OF OUR PROFITS. WE FEEL THAT'S FAIRLY PHILANTHROPIC NO I'M JUST WOULD YOU INVEST IN CALIFORNIA IS WHAT I'M CALIFORNIA ARE  NEW INVESTMENT IS ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IN ON THE PHILANTHROPIC SIDE CORRECT SO ADDED THE EIGHT ABOUT EIGHT TO THAT AND WHAT WHAT KIND OF WORK IS THAT. SO TRADITIONALLY ARI I SPENT A LOT OF DOLLARS ON STEWARDSHIP TRAIL MAINTENANCE TRAIL DEVELOPMENT. BUT WE'RE ALSO -- AND SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE PROJECTS WERE SUPER EXCITED ABOUT IS RECLAIMING THE LA RIVER -- BUT INCREASINGLY WERE ALSO INVESTING AND ACCESS. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS WELL REPRESENTED IN THE OUTDOORS AND SO WE'VE GOT A AT LEAST A HALF DOZEN PARTNERSHIPS IN THE STATE THAT -- GO TO BRING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INTO THE OUTDOORS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED COMMITTEES AND THE OUTDOORS EXCELLENT YEAH NO I RESENT TH HEADWATERS OF THE LA RIVER IN CANOGA PARK AND NO ONE EVER GOES THERE. pCERTAINLY NEEDED SO WE APPRECIATE THAT GIVE A SENSE FROM BROADER INDUSTRY. WELL FRIENDLY NOW PER LINES PERSPECTIVE WE'RE WORKING WITH LAND MANAGERS AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THIS YEAR'S SO QUIET FORCE PLANNING THAT'S COMING TOGETHER. AND WE'RE IN THIRTY LANGUAGE WE'RE MOBILIZING OUR CONSTITUENTS TO HELP. MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S MORE LANGUAGE REGARDING ACCESS AND EQUITY IN PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THAT ON BECAUSE WE KNOW IN ORDER FOR OUR OUR OUR INDUSTRY TO GROW -- WE NEED TO GET MORE STORAGE AND CONSERVATIONISTS INTO PUBLIC LANDS AND SO PERMITTED OUTDOOR LIGHTS PERSPECTIVE WE ARE USING OUR TIME RESOURCES ARE VOLUNTEERS ARE STEWART'S TO HELP BE A PART OF THAT DECISION MAKING AND POLICIES. GIVE A SENSE OF TOTAL AMOUNT INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA IT I DON'T HAVE A DOLLAR AMOUNT SIR NOW. SO. I'LL STEP AWAY NOW BUT I I APPRECIATE THE THE THE THE RATIONALE THE AMENDMENT. WAS TO REALLY TRY TO LOOK FOR THOSE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD BECAUSE WE KEEP RUNNING AND IMPACTS ON STATE DOLLARS SPECIALLY BOND DOLLARS. RIGHT TO DO THE SOFT THE SOFT ACTIVE THE TRANSPORTATION THE PERSONNEL THE IN THEM -- THAT'S BEEN AN ONGOING CHALLENGE SO I'M HOPING THAT THIS OFFICE IS REALLY GOING TO BE A HUB TO BRING THE FULL ECONOMIC POWER THE OUTDOOR RECREATION INDUSTRY TO BEAR AND THEN WE'LL SORT OF TO LOOK AT GAP FILLING RIGHT O SEE OKAY STATE'S GOT BOND DOLLARS HERE BUT MAYBE. WE CAN NOT JUST HAVE KIDS GO TO THE BEACH FOR ONE DAY A YEAR BUT ACTUALLY HAVE A CAMP THAT THEIR SCHOLARSHIPS AND THEY CAN SHOW UP EVERY EVERY DAY YOU KNOW FOR A WHOLE SUMMER OR YOU KNOW WHAT WHETHER THEY'RE OUT IN. THE SALINAS VALLEY YOUR CENTRAL COAST WHEREVER MAY BE SO -- APPRECIATE YOU TO THINKING ABOUT BUILDING THAT ARCHITECTURE AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT ENGAGEMENT AFFORD AND WITH THAT I'M GONNA HAND THE GALLON THE VICE CHAIR AND STEPPED OUT FOR JUST A SEC -- YOU SUPPORTING YEAH I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND AND THEN WE WILL TAKE A RECESS BUT I WILL BE BACK IN JUST. THREE MINUTES THEIR MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. KIND OF FOLLOWING UP ON THOSE QUESTIONS. HOW DO YOU SEE AS THE AUTHOR HOW DO YOU SEE THIS OFFICE? HAVING AN INTENTIONAL. COMMITMENT TO INVOLVING. YOUTH AND FAMILIES WHO HAVEN'T TRADITIONALLY BEEN. MAYBE MIDDLE OR HIGHER LEVEL INCOME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL SPORTING ACTIVITIES YEAH THAT IS CERTAINLY THE INTENT AND PART OF THE MANDATE OF THE OFFICE IS TO BUILD ON THE DIRECTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SENT WHICH IS BRING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- INTO THE OUTDOORS SO THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHY I THINK WE NEED THIS OFFICE BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED THAT COORDINATION. WITH OUR OWN STATE AGENCIES AND ALSO WITH INDUSTRY TO DO THAT I WOULD THINK IS THIS MOVES FORWARD. HAVING THAT INTENTIONALITY REFLECTED ALSO MAY BE IN A% CONVENTIONAL ADVISORY. COMMITTEE -- THAT HAS. NOT A FORMULA -- QUOTA BIT INTENTIONAL INCLUSION OF PREVIOUSLY UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES IN OUTDOOR RECREATION. I KNOW THIS IS THE POLICY COMMITTEE I'M JUST ANY THOUGHTS ON FUNDING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. A THE COST TO ESTABLISH AN YOU KNOW I I COME I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND YOU KNOW I I WAS ELECTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT BEFORE THE RECESSION. AND DURING THE RECESSION I HAD A ARGUED -- YOU KNOW SUCCESSFULLY IN MY CITY THAT THE BEST WAY WE COULD SPEND OUR MONEY WAS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IT PAID OFF THEIR DIVIDENDS THAT CAME BACK TO THE CITY WITH SALES TAX AND PEOPLE MOVING IN AND I BELIEVE THE SAME THING I THINK MONEY SPENT ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IS MONEY WELL SPENT BECAUSE IT COMES BACK TO THE STATE AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUR ROLE REPRESENTATIVES THAT THEY HAVE AMAZING OUTDOOR. AMENITIES IN THEIR DISTRICTS AND THEIR SUFFERING IN THEIR DISTRICTS ECONOMICALLY BUT BUT THERE'S NO PROMOTION SORT OF STATEWIDE. FOR THEM SO YOU KNOW I REPRESENT GRAVERT PARK WE HAVE NO SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE. FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY RUNNING AROUND GRIFFITH PARK BUT IF YOU ASK THOSE SAME PEOPLE WHAT WHERE DO YOU GO WHITE WATER RAFTING WHAT ABOUT THE STANISLAUS WHAT ABOUT. WHERE THAT PICTURE WAS PAINTED THEY HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TOLD THEM SO WE CAN BRING THAT SAID THAT SAME TOURISM LEVEL ALL ACROSS THE STATE? AND WE CAN HELP PROP UP AREAS THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE SUFFERING ECONOMICALLY. GREAT WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS -- YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SO TO TAX THAT WOULD GENERATE A LOT OF REVENUES. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA WE WOULD LOVE TO A TO IN THIS PROMOTES COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH SO KEEP IN MIND. THANK YOU. THE END WITH THAT I I WOULD SAY -- I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU NOT DO THAT RIGHT NOW. I I ACTUALLY HAVE -- TWO ISSUES I I KIND OF SAW THIS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE CONVERSATION IS GOING AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING -- SOME OF THE TESTIMONY BUT THIS I SEE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE ECONOMIC. OPPORTUNITY BILL AND WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I HAD A SELECT COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT ROW CALIFORNIA I THOUGHT WE'D BE LOOKING AT TOURISM. NOT BECAUSE TERRACE. COMMON THEY SPEND MONEY AND THEY GO AWAY AND THEY NORMALLY DON'T CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS AND THAT'S WHAT. REALLY -- SMALL GROW COMMUNITIES NEED DESPERATELY NEED -- AND I IN THE SENATE DISTRICT HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST WETLANDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S IT IS A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL STATE AND PRIVATE LANDS. AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT TRAVELING ON I.. FIVE GOING FROM LA TO WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING SO -- SO I REALLY THINK THIS IS THIS IS IMPORTANT -- AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN INCLUDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY GATEWAYS IDENTIFY STOPS -- YOU KNOW TEN THINGS YOU CAN DO TO SEE -- UP WILDLIFE BACK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WOULD BE TERRIFIC BUT ALSO -- SO FACILITY SIGNAGE YOU KNOW ACCESS ALL OF THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO -- THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE. TO TO HOUSE IT EITHER AGO BIZZARE VISIT CALIFORNIA AS OPPOSED TO JUST STICKING IT IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT IT'S RELATED TO SOMETHING THAT IS. THAT IS -- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -- BUT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST MY MY OPINION A LOT OF TIMES WE WE JUST PUT THINGS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THEN -- AND BECAUSE IT KIND OF MAKES YOU THINK IT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO THE GOVERNOR'S HEART BUT BUT SOMETIMES I THINK IT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HOOK IT INTO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON SUCH AS MY TWO CENTS WORTH I THINK IT'S AN IT'S A REALLY. INTERESTING. OPPORTUNITIES TO DO A BUNCH OF THINGS AND AND I AM CONCERNED THAT ULTIMATELY ABOUT HOW IT'S FUNDED BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE STATE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT I I WILL TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT TO GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION SO WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE BEST PLACE TO DAMASCUS. THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU YEAH YEAH. I AM ON GEO SO -- AND I'M I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. TOO AND IT JUST A COUPLE THOUGHTS AND I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING FOR SOME REASON I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING IN THE GO HIS OFFICE BUT I THINK THERE'S A CALIFORNIA MY LIVING BETTER. BUT EITHER ONE I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA SO WE MIGHT CONSIDER THAT AS A GHOST NGO I WOULD IMAGINE GOING TO GO TO PREPARATIONS AFTER GEO -- WHICH AMAZON PROVISIONS. SO THAT THE COUPLE CONCERNS -- AND COMMENTS NO NOT NO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REALLY BUT THE FUNDING HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP -- YOU ALSO GOING FORWARD HOW THAT'S YOU KNOW GOING TO BE HANDLED OBVIOUSLY IS A CONCERN ALL THOSE OF US OF SPOKEN ABOUT IT -- ACCESS -- I THINK THAT'S A A GREAT GOAL OF THE BILL IN THE OFFICE -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME YOU MENTIONED HUMAN ACTS THAT HUMAN POWERED -- OPPORTUNITIES WHICH I'M A PART OF THAT WITH MY MOUNTAIN BIKING -- SO SENDING ABOUT MAKING CESSATION IN A SAN DIEGO -- AND I'VE MOUNTAIN BKE DOLLAR CALIFORNIA'S SAYS HI BY THE WAY -- GOOD AT AND BUT AND I RAISES CONCERN WHEN I MET WITH THE PROPONENTS A COUPLE MONTHS AGO I'M ALSO YOU KNOW AN IMPORTANT. THING TO ME IS MOTORIZED ACCESS AS WELL. WHICH I KNOW THAT'S NOT PART OF YOUR PROMOTION O THIS -- I DID POINT OUT TO THE PROPONENTS THAT YOU KNOW THOSE OF US THAT ARE IN THE MOTORIZED ACCESS ALSO SPEND MONEY AT ARI I A LOT OF IT AND OTHER PLACES. I TO GET OUR EQUIPMENT SO. NOT SO MUCH A CONCERN WITH THIS BILL -- BUT MOVING FORWARD WITH THE OFFICE IT WOULD BE I I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM IF THE OFFICE EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING THAT. WAS PROMOTING AND PROTECTING HUMAN POWERED ACCESS AT THE EXPENSE OF MOTORIZED ACCESS THAT WOULD AND I THINK THAT THOSE TWO THINGS CAN LIVE. IN HARMONY -- THEY DO NOW AND SO I'M JUST REYES AS A CONCERN MOVING FORWARD IF THIS BECOMES LAW BECOMES A THING -- THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I WOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR AS THE OFFICE INVOLVED -- AND BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW -- INTEREST GROUPS IN IN CALIFORNIA THAT WANT TO ELIMINATE MOTORIZED ACCESS A LOT OF AREAS THAT ALREADY HAVE IT. AND THAT WOULD BE SOME THAT WOULD BE CONCERN TO ME -- AND THEN IT TALKING ABOUT -- FOR LACK OF A VERY SPREADING THE USE OF OUR OUR PARKS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S A BIG DEAL YOU KNOW WHEN I MOVED. TO CALIFORNIA NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA WAS THE SHINING EXAMPLE OF STATE PARKS -- THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY NICE I STILL THINK IT. IS AND THEN WE'VE GOT A LOT OF STATE PARKS THAT ARE -- OVER USED AND THEN. AT TO THE POINT I THINK ONE WE WERE MAKING -- YOU KNOW TEN MILES AWAY WE'VE GOT PARKS IT ARGUES HARDLY AT ALL THERE'S CAMPGROUNDS IN MY DISTRICT. THAT ARE -- BEAUTIFUL CAMPGROUNDS HAVE FIRINGS -- VAULT TOILETS WATER HOOKUPS AND YOU GO IN THERE AND ONE CAMPSITE MIGHT BE TAKEN AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE NOBODY'S PROMOTING THAT PARTICULAR PARK TO BE AND IT'S FREE -- NOBODY'S. PROMOTING A PARTICULAR PARK TO BE USED SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BEING ONE OF THE FOCUSES OF THIS IDEA. AND THAT'S ALL I HA IN YOUR WELCOME TO RESPOND ANY OF THAT ARE THOSE ARE JUST COMMENTS THE OF THING THAT I HAD I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AS SOMEONE WHO WHEN I GO INTO THE OUTDOORS MY PREFERRED METHOD IS NOT HUMAN POWERED AS WELL I PREFER AB ONE POWERED. SO I WILL DEFINITELY -- YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS ON A IN FOCUS AND I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU I THINK WE CAN USE A RANCHER CREAM MAC A PARK IS REALLY AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT'S ACCOMPLISHED -- BETWEEN HUMAN POWERED -- MOUNTAIN BIKING THERE'S A A LITTLE BIT OF MOTORIZED ON THE I DON'T THINK IN THE PARK ITSELF BUT ON THE JUST ON THE BORDER OF THE PARK. AND THEN EXPLAIN -- THERE IS A WAY FOR ALL OF THOSE. USES TO LIVE IN HARMONY WHEN THEY'RE PROPERLY PROMOTED PROPERLY. THE USERS ARE EDUCATED AND WE DON'T HAVE TO LIMIT ACCESS FOR ONE IN FAVOR OF THE OTHER THERE'S TWO SECONDS TO SENSE SENATOR -- COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS ABOUT -- LOAD BALANCING ACROSS PARKS AND BRING IN A BUSINESS MINDSET -- BIZ DEV MINDSET SHOULD HELP WITH THAT -- LOAD BALANCING. ON THE DIVERSITY OF USERS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE NINETY BILLION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATED WITHOUT A RECREATION THAT'S NINETY BILLION SPREAD ACROSS ALL THE USER GROUPS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AND SO. THIS DOES NOT WORK UNLESS YOU'VE BRANDT BROUGHT IN THE RV YEARS YOU BROUGHT IN THE A TV YEARS ABROAD IN THE EQUINE. AS WELL AS AS WE MIGHT BE AT THAT THE THE LEAD IN THIS MOMENT BUT WE'RE ALL PART OF A LARGER COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZE THAT A I GREW UP IN COLORADO -- THERE'S ENTIRE MOUNTAIN TOWNS THAT WERE DEVASTATED BY THE BY THE EXIT OF MINING. THEY HAVE NOW COMPLETELY RECOVERED. BECAUSE OF MOUNTAIN BIKING ATV ACTIVITY WHITE WATER RAFTING -- IT CITIES THE ARE LIKE NOW HIP AND COOL BECAUSE THEY'VE COMPLETELY RECOVER BECAUSE THESE ACTIVISTS THANK YOU. ARE WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL NO MOTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DíAS -- IT WILL TAKE AT LET'S VOTE REAL QUICK BEFORE WE BREAK. THIS STERN. STERN AYE JONES JONES I ALLEN GORGEOUS. CABALLERO CAREER AYE HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON MONEY. MONEY AND I THE BILL HAS FOR IT ON CALL AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T THE MOTION WAS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITTEE -- DO YOU WANT ME TO NOW SISTER YOU AN ANSWER.

FIVE FIFTY TWO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE MY APOLOGIES FOR KEEPING YOU WAITING. I BLAME SOMEONE ELSE -- THANK YOU FOR HEARING. OUR BILL AB FIVE FIFTY TO ADD. A WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED. IN THE COMMITTEE BILL IN OR IN THE IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES WE FOUND SOME REVENUES THAILAND'S REVENUES THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS STARTING THE LATE. AND THEN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE COLLECTED. AND USED. FOR COASTAL RESOURCES AND THEN IT WAS SWEPT IN THE GENERAL FUND AND I THINK. THAT WOULD BE BETTER SERVED TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE REVENUES AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ALONG THE COAST AND SINCE THERE COASTAL DERIVE. BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE COASTAL ZONE OF PROJECTS THAT ARE BUILDING ON ADAPTATION. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT. THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE RESILIENT A NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO ADAPT TO OUR CHANGING CLIMATE. BUT THERE WILL NEED TO BE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE MONEY AVAILABLE TO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THIS IS THE FIRST TOàN THAT WATER IF YOU WELL. OF TAKING A PART OF THOSE REVENUES BACK FOR HOW THE GENERAL FUND AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO SOME OF THEIR ADAPTATION WORK. WHAT I'M HOPING BECAUSE A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT WE RAISES BOND MONEY ANDOTHERS THAT HAVE RESTRICTIONS BUT I'M HOPING IS THAT THIS IS MONEY THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE? WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY TO LET IS YOUR SIX CAN DO THE PLANNING THAT'S NECESSARY TO BUILD RESILIENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL NO HERE ON BEHALF OF AUTUMN ON CALIFORNIA'S SPONSORS OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION FOR YOU TODAY -- I'LL BE BRIEF AND AND JUST -- HOPEFULLY TRY TO COMPLEMENT THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS -- IN SAYING THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS AS POINTED OUT BY THE ANALYSIS IS IS. THE CRITICAL LACK OF FUNDING FOR THESE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THUS FAR. TO SOME FUNDING THAT'S BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THE CLIMATE READY PROGRAM AT THE COSTA CONSERVANCY -- WHICH HAS BEEN LARGELY FUNDED YOU KNOW TEN MILLION DOLLARS SO SO FAR. LARGELY FUNDED THROUGH ENVIRONMENT LICENSE PLATE ON ABOUT SEVEN MILLION OF IT. HAS BEEN -- FROM THAT FUND SOURCE AND MOST RECENTLY TWO YEARS AGO OR I GUESS LAST. YEAR. THREE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GAS PRODUCTION FUND. I'M YOU KNOW IN IN THIS SESSION I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS FOR THESE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT HAVING COME TO FRUITION -- SO REALLY JUST POINTS TO THE THE NEED AND AND THE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BILL THAT IS BEING OFFERED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE. ARMED AND THEREFORE WOULD -- REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. YOU SO MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON JAMIE I WANT TO HAVE A SOUL AS WELL AS THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON NATALIE NEXT ON BEHALF OF OCEAN CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT. MUCH. AND ALSO WE HAVE A CYNICAL CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SIR CRISTINA HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION IN OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IN NINE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO VERY LONELY DíAS APPRECIATE YOU BEING A MEASURE FORWARD. AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THE AMENDMENTS SETTING HIS NOVEL. IT'S TIME WE START PUTTING THAT FUN BACK TO WORK TO DEAL WITH THE IMPACT OF OIL AND ALL THE THE CLIMATE. COST THAT IT CAUSES AND I THINK THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING THEME YOU'LL SEE AND ALL THIS SORT OF ADAPTATION RESILIENCE BILLS WERE REALLY KEEN ON TRYING TO QUANTIFY THE TOTAL SCOPE OF NEED HERE OVERALL I THINK. THIS IS THIS A GOOD WAY TO CHIP AWAY BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'LL BE I THINK A DROP IN THE BUCKET AS TO THE TOTAL OUT SAMEER LIKE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT FUNDING BUT WE STILL I THINK IS A STATE OR FLYING BLIND IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL. I'M AT RISK WE'RE FACING BASICALLY -- SO HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HELP DRIVE THAT PROCESS ALONG A LITTLE BIT MORE AND I'LL BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY [inaudible] CLOSE. THANK YOU N. WITH THAT YES IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT HOPEFULLY THIS IS A WAY TO PRIME THE PUMP. AND KIND OF WHAT EVERYBODY'S APPETITE WHAT'S POSSIBLE IN FROM THIS I'M HOPING WE CAN BUILD. YOUR SUPPORT GOOD THANK YOU -- I CANNOT ENTERTAIN A MOTION AT THIS POINT SO WE WILL WHEN YOU GET AT OCEAN YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] SUMMER MULLIN. ON WORDS TOWARDS MORE RESILIENCY AB EIGHT THIRTY NINE YES SIR. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'LL START BY THANKING THE CHAIR% AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR AN EXCELLENT NOW SAYS THERE ARE TWO PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WHICH I AM PLEASED TO TAKE. AND I THINK THEY MAKE IT A STRONGER BILL THEY ARE COVERED ON PAGES SIX AND SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S DONE GREAT WORK TO DATE INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPING GUIDANCE IN PLANNING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION. AS A COMMITTEE THE HOUSE IS APTLY POINTS OUT THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. IS THE AGENCY LEVEL LEAD ON THE SEATS CLIMATE ADAPTATION POLICY AND NATURAL RESOURCES CLIMATE POLICY. THE RESOURCES AGENCIES TASKED WITH REVISING THE SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA PLAN THE STATE'S CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY EVERY THREE YEARS. AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN INCLUDES A LIST OF QUALITATIVE METRICS TO EVALUATE PROGRESS. TOWARDS MEETING THE STATE'S ADAPTATION GOALS IDENTIFIED THERE IN. MEASURING PROGRESS IS REPEATEDLY MENTIONED IN THE PLAN. I INTRODUCED AB EIGHT THIRTY NINE AND RISK. CALL FROM NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OR IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- INSISTS THAT WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT MORE TEETH TO OUR EXISTING EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. THE BILL DOES THE FOLLOWING IT DESIGNATES THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO LEAD THE STATE'S CLIMATE ADAPTATION% STRATEGY. AND TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC RESILIENCY FRAMEWORK THAT BUILDS ON THE SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA PLAN. CRITICALLY THAT FRAMEWORK WILL INCLUDE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS WITH TIME TABLES AND METRICS TO MEASURE THE STATE'S PROGRESS IN BUILDING AND INVESTING IN ADAPTATION RESILIENCY PROJECT. EACH STATE AGENCY IDENTIFIED IN FRAMEWORK FOR REPORT TO THE SECRETARY ON ITS PROGRESS COMPLETING THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL CREATES THE RESILIENCY THROUGH ADAPTATION ECONOMIC VITALITY AND EQUITY ACCOUNT. WHERE FUNDING FOR ADAPTATION PROJECTS CAN BE CONSOLIDATED? NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TREASURER AND PR WILL DEVELOP GRANTS AND FINANCING TOOLS TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS IN THE FRAMEWORK. AS HE NOW SAYS ALSO NOTES THERE ARE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL WAYS OF THIS ACCOUNT COULD BE FUNDED. WE WORK WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE ON THE FINANCING LANGUAGE BECAUSE WE KNOW WE WILL NEED TO DO MORE THAN JUST AWARD. PARMI WE ALL RECOGNIZE A MASSIVE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS I PERSONALLY THINK THAT ADDITIONAL BOND MONEY WILL BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE. BUT AB EIGHT THIRTY NINE LEAVES THAT DETERMINATION TO FUTURE BUDGETING DECISIONS ONE LAST COMMENT BEFORE HE MOVED TO SUPPORT TESTIMONY. WE RECENTLY AMENDED THE BILL THE STRIKE LANGUAGE CONCERNING THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND INSURANCE PREMIUMS THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE WAS VERY HELPFUL IN WORKING WITH MY OFFICE RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE'S A MUCH LARGER DISCUSSION ON THAT PARTICULAR. ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE SO WE FELT THAT THAT'S BETTER PLACED OUTSIDE OF THIS BILL. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES -- IN SUPPORT GOOD THANK YOU WELCOME. DEFINITE THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ OUT US ON BEHALF OF PUSHING CONSERVANCY IN FRIENDS A LOS ANGELES RIVER. IN STRONG SUPPORT TODAY. WELL THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A LEADER ON CLIMATE POLICY FOR NUMBER OF YEARS. WE HAVEN'T NECESSARILY CREATED A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY AROUND CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY. HE THERE HAS BEEN SOME MEASURES -- WE'VE PASSED OVER THE YEARS THAT -- DO TALK ABOUT ADAPTATION OF OVER MISSING IS A FRAMEWORK THAT SAYS. WE SHOULD BE PROACTIVELY DEALING WITH ADAPTATION RESILIENCY. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME GOVERNING CLARITY ON GOVERNING STRUCTURE AROUND THAT. WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT METRICS AND GOALS OF WATER WE ADAPTING OR WHAT WE BECOMING RESILIENT TOWARDS OR FOR AND THEN ULTIMATELY WE KNOW IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY COMPLICATED FISCAL. ISSUE TO DEAL WITH STATEWIDE WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NONPROFITS STATE GOVERNMENTS REGIONAL. I AGENCIES TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THOSE IMPACTS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE BILL. BORDER PUTS FORTH AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM. THAT ALLOWS US TO START THINKING BACK TO ME TAKE STATE FINDING OTHER PUBLIC RESOURCE DOLLARS AND PRIVATE SPENDING IN. TO HIS BEST TO AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TO ADVANCE THOSE EFFORTS AROUND OF THE OVERALL SPIEGEL AND FRAMEWORK. SO AGAIN IN STRONG SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON SOME THE AMENDMENTS AND APPRECIATE THE AN AUTHOR'S EFFORT HERE TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT WE NEXT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CESSATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION COURSE CALIFORNIA TROUT.

THE COST IS BIG IS THE LA -- SAYS THE AT THE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT NO COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE COSTS TO THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAS BEEN COMPLETED AT THIS TIME SO. WE LIKE GETTING THIS FRAMEWORK IN PLACE. I THINK I WOULD PUT A PLUG IN TO TO TAKE A LOOK AT SB FIVE WHICH I BELIEVE IS COMING YOUR WAY WHICH IS TAKES A REDEVELOPMENT APPROACH. TO I AGREE WITH YOU BINDING IS GONNA MAKE SENSE THERE'S GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET CREATIVE ABOUT REVENUE. TO MEMBER STONE LOOKED AT THAILAND'S -- BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT TO ASSESS THE NEEDS AND HAVE A WAKE UP CALL HERE ABOUT THE ENDING COST OR IT'S TOO LATE SO I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING. TO GET AHEAD OF THAT ISSUE -- AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY -- AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW ONCE HE SAID THIS FRAMEWORK IN PLACE HERE AND INSURANCE ISSUES YOU BROUGHT UP. BUT YOU'RE QUITE VALID IF WE CAN START TO BUY DOWN THAT RIZ. THE INDUSTRY SHOULD REFLECT THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT RIGHT NOW TO PUT THE SPARE ON FIRE.

GOT A TEXT MESSAGE PLEASE COME. OPPORTUNITY. THIS. IS A GOOD PITCH SO IT'S AB SEVEN TWO TWO YES YES. OKAY. THANK YOU. I LIKE THE OPTIMISM. MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN TWENTY TWO THIS MEASURE WILL HELP ALLEVIATE IBM FEES FOR IRRIGATION DISTRICTS. WITH LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED RATE PAYERS THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL THAT WILL HELP SEVERAL SMALL IRRIGATION DISTRICTS IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES BUT NOT JUST LIMITED TO ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. FIVE IN AMADOR COUNTY JACKSON VALLEY IRRIGATION DISTRICT OPERATES THE JACKSON CREEK DAM. WITH THE RECENT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE DAM SAFETY INSPECTION PROGRAM JACKSON CREEK WILL BE EXPERIENCING UNFAIRLY HIGH FEES YOU TO WHAT I BELIEVE ARE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THE A DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS A BRANCH OF THE W. R. WHO INSPECT INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED TO DANCE. THE TERM IS FEES IS BASED OFF A HIGH OF THE DAM. AB I D.. REMEMBER IT'S JACKSON -- EVERY CATION DISTRICT. I HAS A HIGH HIGH OF A HUNDRED NINETY THREE FIFTY BUT ONLY TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF STORAGE. IN COMPARISON NEIGHBORING DAMS WITH ALMOST NINETEEN TIMES YES I SAID NINETEEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF WATER STORED IN THEM. BUT SHORTER HIGH EIGHT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS LESS. J. V. I. D. PROVIDES WATER MOSTLY FOR AGRICULTURE. THEY DO NOT HAVE A CAPACITY TO CONTINUE PAYING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY WE'RE SHORT INSPECTIONS. THEIR FEES ARE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. FIFTEEN I'M FIFTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS YEAR. WHICH IS A 10%. OF THEIR IT WHICH IS 10% OF THEIR BUDGET UNFORTUNATELY AS WE SUGGESTED THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAISE TAXES ON A HANDFUL OF USERS. WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING THIS LAND FOR GENERATIONS? MEMBERS MY CONSTITUENTS WENT TO THE D. S. O. BE ASKING. FOR WELL SOME HELP. THEY WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS ME. AND SEVERAL ARE LEGISLATIVE IDEAS WERE SET. THIS MEASURE WOULD ONLY IMPACT THE DIVISIONS NINETEEN MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM BY APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AGAIN THE ME RESTATE THE DIVISION HAS NINETEEN A NINETEEN MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM. AND IT WILL ONLY IMPACT THEM BY A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN CLOSING I JUST LIKE TO REITERATE THAT AB SEVEN TWENTY TWO WOULD CAP THESE FOR IRRIGATION DISTRICTS WOULD LESSEN. I FIVE HUNDRED RATE HERE LIMIT THE 20% OF THE AMOUNT ASKED FOR EACH YEAR. THIS MAJOR MADE IT OUT OF THE PARK LAST POLICY COMMITTEE ON CONSENT. AND OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. I'D LIKE TO THANK EACH OF YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY IN ADVANCE. AND WITH ME I HAVE A COUPLE OF WITNESSES MISTER CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE AYE MR GEORGE LAMBERT HE'S THE BOARD CHAIR OF THE J. V. I. D. DISTRICT AND MISTER STEVEN FREDERIC. THE GENERAL MANAGER IF YOU WOULD ALLOW THEM A COUPLE MOMENTS TO SECURE. IS ENFORCED PLEASE. PLEASE COME FORWARD. YES AND BOASTED OR TAKE A STANDING MIKE TO OVER THERE -- TO YOUR RIGHTS OR OR HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME STEVEN FREDERIC. MANAGER OF JACK'S MIGLIOR GEISHA DISTRICT MANAGER SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN JUST WANT TO START OFF WITH. READING THE ANALYSIS OTHER SOME DISCREPANCIES I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT OF THE FIRST THING IS -- WHY ARE? WHY SHOULD THE JV ID GET SUBSIDIZED BY OTHER DAM OWNERS? WE FEEL THAT WE ARE SUBSIDIZING OTHER DAM OWNERS. I'LL GIVE A PERFECT EXAMPLE -- EAST BAY MUD WHICH IS A NEARBY FACILITY. ONLY LAKE COMANCHE OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES BUT RESERVOIR. IS LESS OF A DANTE THAN WE DO. WE HAVE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET [inaudible] DRASTIC DIFFERENCE. IN COMPARISON IT TAKES US ABOUT FOUR HOURS EVERY YEAR FR DS THIRTY TO COME OUT. AND ACTUALLY INSPECTOR FACILITY. IT TAKES OVER A WEEK THAT IS VERY MUCH. AND THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE DAM FEE [inaudible] SO. THE NEXT OUR POINT IS AS WIDE AS A JV ID RAISE RATES. ARE THE ANALYSIS LOOKED AT A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN LAUGHTER REVIEW. ACTUALLY IN LATE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE DID DO A 50% RATE INCREASE THAT'S NOT. TO INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. IN MONETIZING OTHER ASSETS WE ACTUALLY WORE MONETIZED AND AND HAD A PARTNERSHIP WITH A INVESTMENT FIRM. WHAT ARE SMALL HYDRO PLANT? BUT WE TOOK THAT OVER FOR ONE DOLLAR BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THE REGULATORY FEES SO -- I HAVE SOME EXAMPLES -- BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE HANDED IS A A COMPARISON FEET TABLE. AND RIGHT OFF THE BAT YOU'LL SEE LAKE AMADOR I THINK WE'RE ALL. CURRENTLY OF WELL AWARE OF WHERE LAKE AMADOR IS AND HOW BIG THAT FACILITY IS. THEY CURRENTLY PAY YOUR LAST YEAR'S FEES WERE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. EIGHT HUNDRED WE PAID FORTY THREE THOUSAND THIS YEAR WE PAID. FIFTY ONE SO THE INCREASE. IT IT'S AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THE S. R. D. IS RELYING ON THIS [inaudible] REVENUE STREAM. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT WAS ACTUALLY THE GENERAL FUND THE FUNDED. DSO DE [inaudible] OPERATIONS. NOW THEY RELY HOPE A 100% ON FEES COLLECTED FROM THE DAM OWNERS. AND AFTER THE LAKE ORVILLE INCIDENT YOU SEE THE BOTTOM TABLE OR THE GRAPH. OF WHAT HAPPENED TO JB ID SPECIFICALLY. AFTER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN THE LAKE ORVILLE INCIDENT WHEN THE DS WOULD BE EXPANDED THEIR PROGRAM. WE GOT HIT PRETTY HARD. OTHER WOMEN IN SPORTS. I LIKE TO DO TO IT I'M GEORGE LAMBERT ON THE BOARD. PRESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT. WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THIS -- DAM BE BEST TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN. AND WE SEEN IT ESCALATE AND WE HAD OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. THE DIVISION OF DAM SAFETY THIS LAST YEAR. WHEN THEY CIRCULATED NEW REGULATIONS? IN THE DAM SAFETY HAS BEEN UNDER SOME PRESSURE TO TRY. TO TO GET THERE. BUT THEY'VE BEEN LIVING TEMPORARY FEES FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND THE AND THEY'VE BEEN DIRECTED TO COME UP WITH A PERMIT REGULATION. TO PLEASE IT WOULD APPLY AROUND THE STATE. OUR CONCERN WAS THAT THERE ARE THESE TO BE. A STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE WAY THOSE FEES ARE CALCULATED. IT'S IN STATUE RIGHT NOW THAT THEY HAVE TO BE BASED PRIMARILY ON HAIFA DAM [inaudible] BUT WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO POINT OUT TO THE DIVISION OF DAM SAFETY IS THAT. A LOT OF OTHER THINGS OR IN PLAY ON OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED IN IN THE THE STRUCTURE. THINGS LIKE DOWNSTREAM RISK. THE THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN STORAGE AND WHAT IT CAN DO IN THE DOWNSTREAM. DAMAGE IF THERE WAS A BREACH OF THE DAM. OUR LITTLE DAM. IT WOULD HAVE SOME IMPACT. BUT WE'D BE PRETTY MUCH LIMITED TO THE OF THE CREEK THAT WE JUST CHARGE AND TO AND IT WOULD GET DOWN AS FAR AS THE TOWN OF GOLF BUT IT WILL BE MOSTLY IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS. WHICH IS OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR WOULD WIPE OUT LODI WHICH IS A PRETTY. PRETTY GOOD SIZED TOWN. YOU TAKE IT. FOR AVAIL YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY DON'T. YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE FEE IS BIGGER THAN OURS BUT NOT BY VERY MUCH AND THEY THEIR FEE IS BASICALLY ABOUT FIVE CENTS PER ACRE FOOT OF WATER IN STORAGE AND OURS IS TO SENSE. ARCHBISHOP TWO DOLLARS. THERE IS A SPICE SENSE OURS IS TWO DOLLARS. IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CALCULATED ON THE ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WATER IN STORAGE VINNIE'S ANY DAMAGE THE STATE. BUT WE WANT TO THE DIVISION OF OF DAM SAFETY AND POINTED THESE THINGS OUT. THEY WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO OUR ARGUMENT. BUT THEY WERE IN A POSITION TO DO MUCH ABOUT IT. BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE. RESTRICTIONS ON I'M. ON HOW THINGS ARE CURRENTLY SET UP. AND THE TRYING TO RE WORKS THE ENTIRE. SYSTEM. IN THE TIME THAT THEY HAD. WAS A VERY PRACTICAL AND WOULD RESULT IN A LOT OF WINNERS AND pLOSERS WHICH THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET INTO. SO THEY DIRECTED US TO MISTER BIGELOW. ED TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK. AND WE FIRST -- LOOKED AT COMING UP WITH A DISADVANTAGED WE WE QUALIFY AS A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. BUT EVEN THAT I HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS -- WERE. YOU KNOW THERE'S TALK IS A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN JUST ABOUT EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE STATE SO IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE TO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT ON THAT BASIS. SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS LITTLE CUT OUT OR SMALL IRRIGATION DISTRICT. AND WHEN WE WE PRESENTED THAT -- TO ASSEMBLYMAN ASSEMBLYMAN BIGELOW'S OFFICE AND TO THE DIVISION THE DAM SAFETY EVERYBODY BREATHES A SIGH OF RELIEF THAT THIS LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY SIMPLE. SIX AND AND WOULDN'T COST VERY MUCH TO IMPLEMENT. SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE YOU KNOW WE WE THINK WE'VE COME UP WITH A GOOD SOLUTION. IT'S VERY MODEST AND AND THE IMPACT ON THE ON THE DIVISION ADVANCE SAFETY BUDGET. HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND A NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE THREE THANK IT WOULD BE A SUCCESSFUL. EFFORT. AND IT WOULD GIVE US A GREAT AMOUNT OF RELEASED AND OTHER COMMUNITIES. SIMILAR TO A THAT'S WHY WE WERE HERE AND WE THANK GOD. IT'S A GOOD. AGOOD WAY TO GO THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE YOU MAKING A TRACK. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. A SENIOR IRANIAN OPPOSITION. A SCENE -- NINE I CAN DIRECTORS TO YOUR BOARD PRESIDENT YOU'RE SITTING RIGHT THERE. THE THE CENTRAL CONCERN I HAD -- WAS EXACTLY THE STRUCTURAL ISSUE YOU BROUGHT UP. YOU KNOW LOOKING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS AND EVEN WITHIN THE DOWNSTREAM HAZARD POTENTIAL CLASSIFICATIONS RICHARD THOSE EXPENSIVE. BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE. THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF VARIABILITY -- AND I RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S TRICKY TO REWORK THAT WITHOUT WINNERS AND LOSERS BUT ON PRINCIPLE I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THIS SORT OF NARROW CUT OUT REGARDLESS HOW NARROW IT IS AND I I KNOW YOU REALIZE THAT. YOU ALL THIS IS A BIG DEAL BUT THE CONCERN THAT I'VE I'VE GOT LOOKING THROUGH THE THEBROADER LIST. IS. EVEN LIKE THE DSO D. COMPARISON FEET TABLE. YOU GO TO LA ALL THESE LA COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS ARE DOWN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. I'M. HIGHER FEES A HIGHER DOLLAR FEE PER ACRE FOOT. HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT ISSUE SOME CAN HAVE MORE FINANCIAL CAPACITY SOME DON'T? SEE THE INSIDE BY THE WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY FOURTEEN RATE INCREASE AND THAT. THOSE ARE HARD POLITICS I AM WELL AWARE THAT. MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO WORK WITH US -- ON WHAT THAT STRUCTURAL REFORM MIGHT ACTUALLY ENTAIL. BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME SOUND ARGUMENTS THERE -- BUT AS A MATTER OF SORT OF JUST GENERAL POLICY. STRUGGLING WITH -- JUST PULL IN ONE PIECE OUT BECAUSE FIRST IT'S YOU ALL MEN AND SOMEONE ELSE AND WE ALREADY HELD THE FLOOR A BILL THAT WAS TANGENTIALLY RELATED BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE CONCERN AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OPENNESS OF THE AUTHOR IS OR YOUR OR YOUR SPONSORS HERE. BUT I I DON'T MEAN THIS TO BE A FALSE PROMISE I I REALLY WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ALL IF YOU DID WANT. TO PULL THE TODAY AND WORK ON THIS IT TO YOUR BILL AND ACTUALLY TRY TO GET SOME OF THAT STATUTORY STRUCTURAL REFORM WITH THE W. R.. I'M UP FOR DOING THAT WORK BUT I I TOTALLY APPRECIATE IF YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE TO VOTE AND SEE WE LAND -- SO I'LL LEAVE THAT AT YOUR DISCRETION. CAN I RESPOND. PLEASE. I THINK IN THE IN THE LONG RUN THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO GO. WE WE WE WOULD APPRECIATE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR OVER TEN YEARS NOW AND AND WORRIED ABOUT THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS ON OUR BUDGET. IN THIS YEAR ALONE YOU KNOW IT THAT THAT BE HAS CONSUMED. THIRD OF OUR OUR TOTAL WATER SALES REVENUE. THIS IS A BIG DEAL TO IT AND THEN WE DON'T WANT THE MOMENT THE PAST. IF WE COULD IF. THERE'S TWO WAYS TO GO HERE ONE IS. THAT BACK AND TRY TO WORK THIS THING THROUGH TO YOUR BILL AND GET SOME REAL. CHANGES IN IN THE WORKS. ON THE WHOLE DAY TO THE STATE ALTHOUGH. YOU KNOW AS I SAID IS THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICS IN THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF ECONOMICS AND ANOTHER WAY TO APPROACH IT WOULD BE TO GO AHEAD AND CREATORS DON'T CUT OUT RIGHT NOW IN. REPLACE IT YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST A BROADER. CHANGED LATER ON AS WE GET THROUGH THE PROCESS. FOR US THAT WOULD BE PREFERABLE BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE SUFFERING ECONOMICALLY FOR THIS AND WE WE HAVE A VERY SMALL BUDGET WE ONLY HAVE A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR BUDGET. WE'VE SPENT. ALMOST A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS JUST IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS ON ALL THE STUDIES AND SIX UPS AND THINGS THAT. NBA WERE UNDER FIRST REGULATION TO WHICH IS FEDERAL FOR OUR LITTLE POWER. AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A BUDGET REASON TO WANT TO GET SOME RELEASED. I SAW THAT WOULD NOT BE MY PREFERENCE IS. TO APPROVED THIS BILL GIVE US SOME RELIEF. AND AND THAT WE WOULD BE GLADLY WORK ON A LONGER TERM. AFTER REFORM UNDERSTOOD. WELL I'M A I'LL LEAVE THAT FINAL DECISION TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HOW YOU WANT TO PROCEED MY PREFERENCE THE PLAN A WHICH IS OLD. DO SOME WORK -- SEE WERE WE GET BUT IF YOU AND TAKE IT TO A VOTE BY ALL MEANS. YOU KNOW ALLOW THE COMMITTEE DISCRETION DID VOTE HOW THEY ARE THEY WITH MISTER CHAIR I AM OPEN TO THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN OPEN TO WORKING WITH. ALL PARTIES TO TRY TO FIND A GOOD SOUND. PLACE TO LAND ON SOLID POLICY I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS IS IS A BILL THAT NEEDS TO DRIVE A GOOD SOUND LEVEL OF THE DIRECTION OF POLICY -- WE DID LOOK AT A YOU KNOW FROM A A DISTRICT WIDE COMPONENT BUT AS DISTRICT WIDE IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE WERE OTHER -- LAKES DAMS AND INSPECTIONS THAT WERE. ALSO EQUALLY IN THE SAME -- SPHERE AS YOU SAW IN THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS PRESENTED. TO WE WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE. ON OF MAKING THIS A TO YOUR BILL AND NOT HAVE TO TAKE A VOTE ON IT I I PREFER TO KEEP A GOOD RECORD GOING. I WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND AND FIND A SOLUTION. TO WITH YOUR EFFORTS AND YOUR AGREEMENT I'D BE WILLING TO SHAKE HANDS AND MOVE FORWARD YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT ABSOLUTELY AND AND YOU ALL AS WELL. I KNOW THIS MATTERS YOU GREAT DEAL THIS YEAR BUT I APPRECIATE. THAT OFFER AND I'M GLADLY ACCEPT AND HOW TO SOLVE IT.

YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH CONVERTING THIS TO TO YOUR TO YOUR BILL -- ON THIS IS ALSO IN IN IN MY DISTRICT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS -- BUT WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING GOOD POLICY AND HAVING THAT POLICY BE SUSTAINABLE -- SO WITH THAT TO THE NORM I'LL BE SUPPORTIVE OF A LEAD THAT YOU'RE OFFERING AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR.

AND AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE COMMITMENT SENATOR AND AND AND MISTER CHAIR JUST TO RECOGNIZE WITHOUT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF ADJUSTMENT OR ARE WE FULL HEARTED EFFORT IN IN MAKING SOME.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT OKAY -- SORRY ONCE OKAY -- WE'RE GONNA KEEP PROCEEDING HERE A NEXT IN THE FILE ORDERS -- IT SOMEWHERE Là MON EIGHTY FOUR OH NINE THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PATIENCE -- ALL THREE OF YOU NOW -- GOOD AFTERNOON. THAT AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AB FOUR OH NINE HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND HAS NO OPPOSITION. IT WOULD IS COMPETITIVE GRANT TO DEVELOP CLIMB ADAPTATION TOOLS RESOURCES AND TRAININGS FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA PLAN FOR CLIMATE CHANGE I HAVE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL LESLIE ROACH ASSISTING COOPERATIVE. EXTENSION SPECIALIST IN RANGELAND SCIENCE AMENDMENT AT UC DAVIS. AND IN ADDITION TO BRIAN SHOW BE CASE YOU HAVE ANY. THANK YOU ISN'T SUPPORT WELL AS YOU TO START A PERIOD HELLO TURN MEMBERS AT BRANCH OF THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AGRICULTURE NETWORK. OUR ORGANIZATION OF FARMERS RANCHERS SCIENTISTS AND SUSTAIN LAG ALLIES. ARE OFFERING THE SERVICE SPONSORED THIS BILL. I'M AS PART OF OUR MISSION TO ENSURE THE FARMERS RANCHERS HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE CLIMATE RESILIENT. I'M SO DOES NOT AS YOURSELF SENATOR I GREW UP IN A FARMING FAMILY AND I THINK WE CAN BOTH THE TEST THE FACT THAT NO ONE CHECKS THE WEATHER MORE THAN FARMERS. IT'S BECAUSE THEIR LIVELIHOODS IN THEIR DAILY DECISIONS DEPEND UPON IT. AS WE KNOW WEATHER PATTERNS ARE CHANGING. AND POST SOME SEVERE THREATS TO OUR SECURITY IN A RURAL ECONOMIES. AS A COUPLE EXAMPLES -- BASED ON RECENT STUDIES FROM. CALIFORNIA BASED SCIENTISTS BUT THEN FOR DECADES YIELDS FOR ALMONDS GRAPES AND ORANGES ARE PREDICTED TO DECLINE BY UP 220%. BROUGH CUTTERS GENERAL PARTNER IN YOUR AREA. THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DECLINE OVER I'M IN CENTRAL VALLEY ECARDS A SUITABLE FOR SOME OF OUR TOP CROPS IN THE STATE -- WALNUTS AND STONE FOR ITS ARE PROJECTED TO BE CUT IN HALF IN JUST THIRTY YEARS. I THINK KERN COUNTY FARMER PUT IT BEST WHEN HE SAID WE ARE ALWAYS AT THE MERCY OF MOTHER NATURE. BUT WITH THE TIME A CLICK A CHANGING CLIMATE WHAT LIES CLOSE ON THE HORIZON IS UNPRECEDENTED. SO I CAN TELL YOU FROM CONVERSATIONS WITH OVER SIXTY GROWERS AND AG INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS LAST FALL. FARMERS DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THE TRAINING THE INFORMATION OF THE TOOLS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND ASSESS AND QUANTIFY THESE NEW RISKS. NORTHERN ABOUT ALL OF THE GREAT EMERGING RESEARCH ON ADAPTATION STRATEGIES. AND SO -- THIS BILL RESPONSE TO THE IN THE CLEAR NEED THEY HAVE FOR AG ADAPTATION PLANNING DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS. I JUST WANNA KNOW FOR THE COMMITTEES THESE TOOLS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN AND SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED FOR OTHER REGIONS OF THE U. S. -- AS JUST ONE COMPELLING EXAMPLE IN THE SOUTHEAST U. S. THEY'VE DEVELOPED A TOOL CALLED AGAR CLIMATE. THAT INCLUDES A REAL TIME DISEASE RISK ALERT SYSTEM FOR STRAWBERRY GROWERS. AND AFTER THE LAST FOUR SEASONS OF TESTING IT'S REDUCE FUNGICIDE APPLICATIONS BY HALF AND SAVE TERMS OF THE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ACRE. THAT'S THE KIND OF TOOL WOULD BE GREAT FAR STRONGER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. I'M SO THIS BILL WOULD FUNDS A SIMILAR TOOLS TAILORED FOR OUR GROWERS. AND I KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER ADAPTATION BILLS OUT THERE BUT I THINK THIS ONE IS RESPONDING TO A A SPECIFIC URGENT NEED. A LOW COST. AND THE WE SHOULD START THEIR STEP. PASSED AFTER DR ROACH THANKS. AFTERNOON. AS A CORPORATE EXTENSION SPECIALIST WITH RANCHERS AND LAND MANAGERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND HAVE SEEN THE IMPACTS ENGINE CLIMATE HAS HAD ON THESE COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS WERE AMONG THE FIRST IN THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY THAT WERE IMPACTED BY OUR RECENT STATEWIDE DROUGHT I'M DOING IS UNPRECEDENTED TIME. RANCHERS IN THE HARDEST HIT REGIONS OF OUR STATE I TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL HEARD REDUCTIONS WITH SOME COMPLETELY LIQUIDATING. EXTREME EVENTS LIKE EXTENDED DROUGHT SO SIGNIFICANT AND CUMULATIVE CHALLENGES FOR SUSTAINING CALIFORNIA'S RANCHES AND RANGE LANDS. AND WITH A MORE VARIABLE CLIMATE FUTURE THESE CHALLENGES WILL CONTINUE PARTICULARLY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. THERE IS A CLEAR AN IMMEDIATE NEED TO CENTRALIZE AND HIGHLIGHT THE MOST RELEVANT AND TIMELY KNOWLEDGE IN TRANSLATE THIS INTO ACCESSIBLE FORMATS. DE DIGITALLY MANAGERS NEED SCIENCE BASED DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS AND TRAINING TO HELP ASSESS RISK. AND ADAPT TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. THE CALIFORNIA RANGELAND ROUTE HUB IS ONE EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL EFFORT THAT INCREASES -- EXISTING RESEARCH AND OUTREACH RESOURCES -- AND SERVES AS A CENTER FOR SCIENCE BASED COMMUNICATION ON RANGELAND DROUGHT SPECIFICALLY. IS MULTIMEDIA HUB HAS EXPANDED ACCESS TO TIMELY MANAGEMENT AND POLICY RELEVANT RESEARCH TO A GROWING DIVERSITY OF RANGELAND DECISION MAKERS INCLUDING ROUTE -- RANCHERS OF RANGELAND -- CONSERVATIONISTS AND LAND MANAGERS TO PRESERVE AND LEARN -- FROM ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE IS THE HUB ALSO HOSTS AUDIO STORIES FROM THE STATE'S RANCHING AND FARMING FAMILIES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE NOW. THE CALIFORNIA RANCHING LIKE CALIFORNIA OUR CULTURE IN GENERAL IT'S DIVERSE IT'S COMPLEX AND IT IS UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE RISKS. REDUCE VULNERABILITY ACROSS ALL TYPES OF OPERATIONS SCIENTISTS AND THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY MUST WORK TOGETHER TO CO DEVELOP DECISION TOOLS THAT ARE LOCALLY RELEVANT AND THAT ARE USABLE. ADDITIONAL UNJUSTLY TARGETED TRAINING IS ESSENTIAL TO INCREASING CAPACITY AMONG THE AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS TO MEET VERY INVOLVING ROLES AS WELL SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF A GROWING AND DIVERSE CLIENTELE. MAKE STRATEGIC DECISIONS IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON THERESA BURKE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

THAT ANALYSIS AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO STAKEHOLDERS WHO ENGAGED. OUR STAFF AND MYSELF ON THIS BILL FROM DAY. ONE I'M PLEASED TO HAVE REMOVED NEARLY ALL OPPOSITION AND SO -- CERTAINLY -- EXCITED ABOUT THAT. AND SO THIS LEGISLATION IT PROPOSES TO ENHANCE -- OIL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY IN OUR STATE -- AND IT DOES SO BY FIRST MAKING SURE THAT WE DEFINE NON FLOATING OIL IN STATUTE. AND SECOND ENSURING THAT SAFETY STANDARDS. ARE REGULARLY UPDATED TO INCORPORATE THE BEST POSSIBLE TOOLS. FOR CLEANUP OF NON FLOATING OIL. YOU KNOW LOOK I I KNOW THAT. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM -- UNDERSTAND THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR STATE WE ARE BLESSED WITH AN WITH INCREDIBLE NATURAL RESOURCES. YOU KNOW A BOOK I READ -- A FEW MONTHS AGO HIGHLIGHTED THIS FACT. ONE ONE PART OF THE BOOK IT SUGGESTED THAT OUR NICKNAME THE GOLDEN STATE. EVOKES A DISTINCTIVE AN UNUSUALLY -- A BEAUTIFUL NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. NO LAND NO STATE. HAS BEEN MORE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE EVOCATIVE TERM PARADISE. IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN IN OUR STATE WE HAVE A VERY LONG HISTORY. AS A STATE OF PROTECTING OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. OF PROTECTING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR SAFETY. AND THERE IS NO DENYING THAT. HERE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN MORE AND MORE HEAVY CRUDE OIL. LIKE THE CANADIAN TAR SANDS OIL CRUDE STOCKS FROM VENEZUELA AND MEXICO. ARE BEING TRANSPORTED TO OUR STATE AND TRANSPORTED BY WAY PIPELINE INTEGRITY. AND BECAUSE OF OUR LOCATION AND SPECIALIZED REFINING CAPACITY. CALIFORNIA WE ARE A DESTINATION FOR NEW SUPPLIES OF THIS NON VOTING OIL. UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT STATE LAW IT DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNT FOR SPILLS. OF NON FOR NOW. AND THIS CREATES SIGNIFICANT REST FOR OUR STATE AND IN PARTICULAR RISK FOR OUR COASTAL AREAS AND THE COMMUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SAFETY AND PREPAREDNESS IS IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES THIS ISSUE AND I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTED THIS VERY WELL. BECAUSE WE CAN ALL LEARN FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. WHEN THE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN A RUPTURED PIPELINE? RESULTED IN A SPILL INTO THE KALAMAZOO RIVER. THIS BILL OF MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND GALLONS OF NON VOTING CANADIAN TAR SANDS OIL. THIS WAS CITED AS THE LARGEST OIL SPILL YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF REMEDIATION OF THIS BILL TOOK FIVE YEARS. COST OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. ACCORDING TO US AGENCIES TOTAL CLEANUP PROVED IMPOSSIBLE THE CONTAMINATION REMAINS TO THIS DAY. ASSEMBLY BILL. NINE THREE SIX IS ABOUT SAFETY AND PREPAREDNESS. AGAIN THIS LEGISLATION MANDATES AN UPDATE OF CALIFORNIA'S -- THE CONTINGENCY PLANNING TO ENSURE. TO ENSURE THAT THE OFFICE OF THE SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE OSCAR IS ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO DEAL WITH SPILLS OF THESE NON VOTING OILS. OIL THE MOST LIKELY TO CAUSE LASTING DAMAGE TO OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT OUR WATER WAYS PUBLIC HEALTH AND CERTAINLY. IRAQ. IT DID IT WILL IMPACT. THIS GOLDEN STANDARD WE HAVE SET -- OF FROM OUR THE ON A NATURAL RESOURCES PERSPECTIVE THIS INCREDIBLE CASTLINE WE HAVE IT WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THAT. SO I APPRECIATE THE TIME TO SHARE. AND I DO HAVE SPONSORS HERE AND WE'LL OTHER TO DO A VERY GOOD THANK YOU SIMILAR. TO THOSE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- BUT JUST AS HE IF POSSIBLE YOU CAN BE BRIEF SOMEONE. IF YOU LIKE. OKAY. I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE HEAVY OPPOSITION. THANK THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- BUT I CAN BURKE WITH CENSUS KOBE KEEPER HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. I THIRTY SIX I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER RIVAS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE -- TEXAS KOBE IS UNDER THREAT. ACTUALLY FROM THESE I'M FROM FROM HEAVY OILS AND TAR SANDS AND THE OTHER HERE WE ALSO SOMETHING OR YOU JUST. MENTIONED IT HAS IS THE LA AREA -- ALONG BEACH -- THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THOSE AREAS ARE ESPECIALLY UNDER THREAT -- SMALLER SPILLS TEND TO HAPPEN YOUR WORKS -- AND THOSE CAN HAVE BIG IMPACTS LIKE IMPACTS BELT AND HELLO -- ON THE BAY WHERE -- I CITY OF A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WAS ORDERED TO SHELTER INDOORS BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO SO -- THESE GUYS JUST BILLS HAVE VOLATILE COMPOUNDS THEY GET INTO THE AIR AND THAT'S WHAT COST -- INSTANTLY HEALTH SO. WE'RE GROPING TODAY -- MAKE THINGS A LOT SAFER FOR THOSE COMMITTEE SAN FOR CALIFORNIA IS ALL -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M JENNIFER SCHEME WITH THE NATURIST WORST AND COUNSEL HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. NINE THIRTY SIX THIS BILL IS A REALLY VITAL PRUDENT MEASURE TO ADDRESS THE THREATS THAT NON POLLUTING WILL SUPPOSED TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES. ECONOMY AND AS ALREADY MENTIONED THE ICONIC GOLD COAST. HI IT'S AN ESSENTIAL STARTING POINT FOR BETTER PREPARING CALIFORNIA FOR THE UNIQUE AND SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FROM A SPELL OF NON POLLUTING OIL -- OFF THE COAST OR INDOOR STATES RIVERS LAKES OR PAYS. THE THREAT OF NON FLOATING OIL SPILLS IS ALREADY PRESENT AND WILL LIKELY GROW. PROPOSED INFRASTRUCTURE OUTSIDE THE STATE SUCH AS THE RECENTLY APPROVED TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPELINE IN CANADA CREATE A STRONG LIKELIHOOD OF INCREASED IMPORTS OF THIS WELL TO REFINERIES IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO. AS I ALREADY MENTIONED THE PEOPLE MICHIGAN LEARNED ALL TOO WELL IN TWENTY TEN AND GET ON NON FOLDING WILL IS UNIQUELY DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN IT. AFTER A SPELL THIS BILL CLARIFIES CALIFORNIA LAW TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE CHALLENGES ENSURING STATE AGENCIES AND SMALL RESPONDERS HAVE CONTINGENCY PLANNING EXPERTISE. RESOURCES AND EQUIPMENT TO RESPOND RAPIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY IN THE EVENT A LARGE NON FLOATING UP OIL SPILL -- THIS BILL ALSO CREATES NON VOTING WILL CERTIFICATION FOR STILL RESPOND HERS AND LEASES RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCHOOL PREPAREDNESS ON THE OPERATORS. MOVING THE OIL INTO THE STATE'S ABOUT IT THIS BILL DOES OCCUR I IMPACTS CAN BE MITIGATED AS QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE IGNORING THIS CRITICAL THREAT THAT NON VOTING WILL POSES TO CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITIES WOULD BE REALLY DANGEROUS AND SHORT SIGHTED. EIGHTY NINE THIRTY SIX STARTS TO BRING CALIFORNIA LAW UP TO DATE TO ADDRESS THIS THREAT. AND COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CONTAINS BILL AND CATASTROPHE FOR CALIFORNIANS PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES AND CITIZENS -- WITH BANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS FOR OFFERING THIS BILL AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIED OUT.

WHAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN OUR HANDS BEST ACHIEVABLE SAYS? CHASING SOMETHING THAT IN FACT. DO WE RECEIVE IT DO WE OBTAIN IT OR DO WE NOT. THAT BEING THE CASE MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE MOVED OUR OPPOSITION BUT I JUST FIND IT VERY INTERESTING THAT THE PROPONENTS. OF THOSE GIVE ME THAT THE SUPPORT OF THE BILL ORGANIZATIONS TO MY RIGHT AND THOSE WHO HAVE. CAME UP IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WILL IN FACT SUPPORT IMPORTING [inaudible] OIL.

SO AGAIN I DO FIND IT A BIT INTERESTING THAT ACTIVISTS ORGANIZATION SAY LET THE IMPORTATION. OF CRUDE VERSUS PRODUCING IT HERE AND THEY ACTUALLY CALL FOR KEEPING IT IN THE GROUND. I JUST FIND IT VERY INTERESTING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY WE THANKS AGAIN AUTHOR WAS WORK AND LOOK FOR THE CONTINUES TO WORKING WITH. THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] ANY IN [inaudible] FIRM OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE BRING BACK TO THE DAYS MEMBERS COMMENTS QUESTIONS MOTIONS. MOTION FROM CENTER COVER GYRO. IT WAS A COMMENT OF INTEREST.

MINUTE TO MINUTE JUST HELPED REAL QUICK SO THE EXISTING LAW IF YOU LOOK AT AGE SIX OF THE BILL -- EXISTING LAW USES BEST ACHIEVABLE TECHNOLOGY. SO. THAT'S DEFINED UNDER CURRENT LAW SAID. THIS WITHIN THIS WOULD CONFORM TO EXISTING LAWS ALREADY IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO ESTABLISH A NEW DEFINITION OF BEST AVAILABLE SO THE INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTED -- SAID. I WAS. IN A PERFECT WORLD WISHING FOR A THAT UNDERLYING -- ALLEGORY TO BE REFORMED IF AS MANY WISHES -- I'M. I'M NOT.

THANK YOU THOUGH. COLLEGES FOR INTERACTION THERE IS A MOTION DO PASS AS AMENDED TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY MANY MORE CLOSE NO HERE DID YOU DID RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR THAT. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ENTER STERN AYE STERN AYE JONES. JONES NO ALLEN FORGES CABALLERO. I HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON THE MONEY TO LINE OKAY TEN WHEN WE WILL LEAVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE INVOLVED HERE. I'M LET'S SEE FILE ORDER HERE -- FRIEDMAN YOU GET. YOU GET NEXT. I FOLLOWS FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SEPTEMBER. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR I MISS THE BACK IN YOUR LAST PRESENTATION WE ARE ON AB FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND THEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN CORRECT THANK YOU OKAY VERY GOOD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IT'S VERY NICE TO BE BACK WITH YOU -- AB A FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO ENFORCE EXISTING WATER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. SOME WHICH HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE SETTING UP REQUIREMENTS FOR A PUBLIC AGENCIES IN TERMS OF WATER REPORTING. MODEL EFFICIENCY WATER PERCY LEGISLATION THAT WE DID LAST YEAR. OUR REQUIRES THAT TO WORK PROPERLY BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM RIGHT NOW OR A WAY TO COME HELP REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. WE SOMETIMES DON'T GET THOSE REPORTS -- FROM AGENCIES MANY OF OUR AGENCIES PROBABLY MOST OF YOUR AGENCIES HERE IN THIS ROOM ARE GREAT ABOUT TURNING OVER THE REPORTS OF THE REQUIRED TO UNDER THE LAW BUT NOT ONLY DO ALL. AGENCIES DO OUR PURPOSE IS TO GET COMPLIANCE WITH THIS LET'S BE CLEAR WE WANT COMPLIANCE IS PUT SOME TEETH -- BEHIND THOSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WHEN WE PASS LAWS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE EXPECT EVERYBODY TO FOLLOW THOSE INCLUDING OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES. WE ALSO HAVE LEGISLATION THIS YEAR THAT STREAMLINES REPORTING SO THAT IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR ALL OF THE AGENCIES TO COMPLY AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE'RE GIVING THEM -- RELIEF FOR SAY WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR YOU TO COMPLY BUT NOW WE EXPECT YOU TO IT IF YOU DON'T WE'RE GOING TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE TO THIS MECHANISM. I'M WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I I'M HERE TODAY WITH A ROW HE SHARMA WITH AN RTC TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANKS SO MUCH WELCOME HEY THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON AT THE CAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ARE WHO SHARMA ANDI'M HERE WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT OF AB. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AS YOU ALREADY KNOW AB FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AUTHORIZES D. W. R. TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING WATER DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ALL IT DOES IS EMPOWER D. W. R.. TO ENFORCE THE LAWS THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS. IF THERE'S ONE MESSAGE THAT I HOPE YOU TAKE AWAY FROM MY REMARKS IT'S THIS. DATA HAVE VALUE. WHEN THE ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING AND FOR PROVIDING CRITICAL WATER DATA DON'T COMPLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS? THE PUBLIC IS LEFT WITH AN INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE PICTURE OF HOW WATER IS USED DISTRIBUTED AND MANAGED ACROSS THE STATE. WHEN 56% OF FARM GATE DELIVERY REPORTS ARE MISSING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANALYSIS AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS STIFLED? ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AS STUDENTS PROFESSORS THINK TANKS CAN USE ALL OF THIS WATER DATA TO DETERMINE PATTERNS OF WATER USE IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR TARGETED WATER EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS AND INVESTMENTS. BUT WHEN 13% OF RECENT WATER LOSS AUDIT REPORTS ARE MISSING THOSE ANALYSES ARE INCOMPLETE. LEGISLATORS AND POLICY MAKERS LIKE YOURSELVES CAN USE THAT DATA FROM THESE REPORTS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF WATER CONSERVATION LAWS. BUT WHEN 65% OF ALL MODERATE MODEL WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE REPORTS ARE MISSING THAT ADVOCACY CAN'T BE PROPERLY CALCULATED. WHEN WATER DATA IS ALLOWED TO LEAK THROUGH THE CRACKS PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO USE THAT DATA IS STIFLED RESTRICTED AND DIMINISHED? THANKFULLY WE CAN FIX THE LEAKY WATER DATA PIPELINE IN AB FOURTEEN FIFTY PROVIDES THE TOOL FOR D. W. R. TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING WATER DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WATER IS ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. DO YOU HAVE YOU ARE CANNOT MANAGE WHAT IT DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MEASURE AND SO I URGE RESPECTFULLY AN AYE VOTE ON FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR BEING HERE OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. YOU BROWN AND ASSOCIATES CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT BEING NINE ANY OPPOSITION. AFTERNOON CHAIR IN MEMBER -- I'M JULIE HALL WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES -- THINK IF THE OPTION TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATION -- WE'RE CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO THE APPROACH IN THE BILL. SO I WOULD LIKE TO I THINK THE AUTHORS OFFICE FOR CONTINUING TO WORK WITH US TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATE PATHWAYS REPORTING COMPLIANCE WE DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE IDEA OF INCREASING REPORTING COMPLIANCE. I'M CURRENTLY UNDER THE BILL THE FIRST MORNING TO A LOCAL AGENCY. FAILING TO SUBMIT A REPORT ON TOP. WOULD BE A CIVIL PENALTY OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IT SEEMS LIKE A DISPROPORTIONATELY HARSH PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO SUBMIT A REPORT ON TIME -- AS A COMEDIAN ELSE'S NOTICE IS NOT THE ONLY POTENTIAL COMPLAINTS MECHANISM AND WITH THE GRADUAL APPROACH COMPLAINTS BE MORE APPROPRIATE. I'M WE SURE TO MEMBERS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE THAT WOULD INCLUDE IN THIS PROCESS AND NOTIFICATION TO THE LOCAL AND CITY OF THEIR FAILURE TO SUBMIT A REPORT. IN ORDER TO ALLOW THEM TIME TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE ON THEIR OWN BEFORE IS A CIVIL PENALTIES ISSUE. AND THIS ALTERNATE WOULD ALLOW THE LOCAL ENTITY TO CORRECT THEIR MISTAKE WITHOUT HARSH PENALTIES. WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OVERALL REPORTING COMPLIANCE I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF AND MORE GRADUAL APPROACH TO COMPLIANCE. AND GIVE MUCH ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BARBARY WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. ON BEHALF FIRST WITH ELDORADO YOUR GAZE AND DISTRICT DOESN'T WATER AGENCY. WE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. AS TO THE VALLEY ATWATER COALITION OPPOSITION IT'S UNLESS AMENDED. EXISTING LAW BUT WITH RESPECT FARM GATE MEASUREMENT. DOES NOT REQUIRE. MEASUREMENT WHEN IT'S NOT LOCALLY COST EFFECTIVE SO WE HAVE ASKED THE THE AUTHOR AND HER STFF TO CONSIDER AN AMENDMENT. IN THE EXCEPTIONS PORTION OF THE BILL. WHERE A LOCAL AGENCY WOULD BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT FARM GATE MEASUREMENT IS NOT LOCALLY COST EFFECTIVE? IN THOSE SITUATIONS OF FINE. WOULD NOT BE IMPOSED YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. MANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. BEING NO BRING BACK THE DIET -- AND WHAT -- WE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY SHOULD YOU BRING IT BOARD FRAMEWORK BILLS LAST YEAR CRITICAL. WILL PROBABLY BE WRESTLING WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND JUDICIARY. ARMS OF MECHANICS AND EXAMINE SOME OF THESE ISSUES. AROUND TIMING AND NOTICE AND BUT ON THE WHOLE I THINK. THE SOUND MEASURE AND BY YOU TO CLOSE YOUR WELCOME TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE OPPOSITION IN YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU LIKE BUT I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- WE HAVE TO END DISCRETION FOR D. W. ARE IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS OFF RAMPS -- FOR VARIOUS ISSUES THAT MIGHT COME UP WITH THESE AGENCIES SO THAT D. W. R.. DOES HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH THEY COULD HEAR IF THERE WAS AN EQUIPMENT -- PROBLEM OR THEY DON'T HAVE TO ISSUE THE PENALTY -- BUT GIVEN THE STREAMLINING THAT WE'RE DOING WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THERE REALLY IS YOU KNOW NOT A LOT OF EXCUSE FOR NOT. NOT -- BEING ABLE TO FILE IN AGAIN YOU W. R. DOES HAVE DISCRETION WHEN IT COMES TO THE PENALTIES. YOU REMIND ME AGAIN BUT YOU IN ANOTHER BILL FOUND IN ADDITION SEE AND HAVE YES THAT THAT YOU CAN. YOU CAN USE YOUR URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT PLANNING WELL THAT THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER BILL THAT'S PASSING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THAT WILL -- BASICALLY STREAMLINED THE REPORTING SO THAT THEY ONLY HAVE TO DO IT EITHER ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR TO RATHER THAN HAVING ALL AND THAT'S FOR ALL SORT OF WATER REPORT SO INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE DO THIS MONTH AND ONE TWO AND THREE MONTHS. YOU CAN SORT OF EITHER DO IT ONCE A YEAR OR TWICE A YEAR ALL AT ONCE WHICH SHOULD MAKE THINGS A LOT EASIER. FOR THEM SO THEY SHOULD BE AN EXCUSE FOR SORT OF ACCIDENTALLY MISSING ONE OF YOUR DEADLINES. THANKS THAT -- I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION BUT IF THERE IS NOT ONE AT THIS TIME WE'LL JUST. BUT YOU MOVE ON WITH YOUR DAY AND WE'LL CONSIDERATION YEAH WE'LL GO IN THE NEXT. ONE VERY GOOD YOU HAVE A MOTION -- WILL MOVE ON THE FIFTEEN AB. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YES YOU MEMBERS I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT THE WILDFIRE CRISIS THAT WE'RE HAVING AND HOW -- DRASTIC ELEMENTS BE COMMON I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF BILLS IN THIS AREA I WILL JUST SAY THAT ONE OF THE POINTS OF LEARNING THAT'S COME OUT OF THE MORE RECENT WILDFIRES. WHERE WE'VE HAD NEWER BUILDINGS THAT HAVE TODAY'S CODES INSTITUTED WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THAT HAVING OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE RIGHT CLOSE TO A STRUCTURE MAKES? IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THAT STRUCTURE SURVIVES. I'M I COULD SHOW YOU SLIDE AFTER SLIDE OF PROPERTIES WERE RATHER THAN SORT OF A WALL OF FIRE MOVING THROUGH. YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE YARD THAT DIDN'T BURN TREES ARE INTACT GRASSES ARE INTACT. THE YARD WAS FINE BECAUSE AN AMBER HIT -- SOMETHING THAT WAS FLAMMABLE RIGHT NEXT TO A BUILDING THE BUILDING WAS LOST SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE A NEW. DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENT IN HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES OF ZERO TO FIVE FEET THIS IS NOT EXIST RIGHT NOW IN OUR CURRENT CODES BUT WORKING WITH CAL FIRE AND FOR OUR FIRE AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. THEY HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA TO HAVE A NON COMBUSTIBLE ZONE SO WHAT WE WILL DO IS MOVE FORWARD TO CREATE THIS NEW ZONE. AND THEN HAVE CAL FIRE WORK TO COME UP WITH SORT OF A GUIDELINE FOR COMMUNITIES IN HIGH FIRE ZONES TO SAY. WHAT REALLY WE SHOULD BE GUIDING PEOPLE TO DO MAYBE THERE IS SOME PLANTING THAT'S ALLOWABLE BUT YOU KNOW DON'T COVER YOUR HOUSE OF BOOKMOBILE USER VINES DON'T PLANT THE REDWOOD RIGHT UP AGAINST YOUR STRUCTURE I HAD A RED WITH THAT WENT THROUGH MY DECK? NOT A GOOD IDEA SO WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT AND REALLY PUSH OUR COMMUNITIES AND WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO GET COMPLIANCE ACROSS THE WHOLE COMMUNITY BECAUSE ONE OUT OF COMPLIANCE HOUSE CAN LEAD TO LOSING AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THAT BUILDING GOES UP. IN SMOKE -- IS SO -- WE WILL WORK TO HAVE THE RIGHT TREE RIGHT PLACE PLANTING UNDER ELECTRICAL LINES AS ALSO AS PART OF THIS BILL AND A GUIDE BOOK TO PROVIDE LANDOWNERS OPTIONS FOR VEGETATION THAT WON'T GROW INTO ENERGIZED CONDUCTOR SO THERE'S A PART OF THE BILL. IT ALSO DEALS WITH THE WITH THE POWER LINES. ON THE FARM BUREAU WOULD LIKE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION BEING GIVEN -- TO GATED FUTURE NOT ORCHARDS AND PART OF THE BILL. AND I DO THINK THAT THAT DESERVES SPECIAL CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THOSE ARE IRRIGATED THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF FIRE RISK AND SOMEONE WHO SPIRALING FIRE WOULD A YOU KNOW UNDER THEIR STARES FOR INSTANCE -- EVER WORKING ON LANGUAGE TO PRUNE BACK THE BILL TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. THAT WAS A PINE IN LAUGHING -- AND FINALLY WE RECENTLY HAD A REQUIREMENT FOR HELLFIRE TO DEVELOP A PARCEL LEVEL WILD WILD FIRE RISK MODEL TO HELP COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND THEIR INDIVIDUAL RISK AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO REDUCE THAT RISK. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON AN ADVISORY -- COUNTS UP PANEL. AB FIFTEEN SIXTEENS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IT HAS TO SUPPORT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY SIERRA CLUB RESEARCH CONSERVATION DISTRICTS FIRE SAFE COUNCILS THE BUILDING INDUSTRY WHO'S HERE WITH ME TODAY. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND AS D. G. AN E.. ARMED WITH THAT I WILL TURN TO CVA THEIR COMMENTS THANK YOU WELCOME CHAIRMAN SENATOR I'M BOB ROEMER SENIOR ENGINEER WITH THE BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THE FIRST SET OF FIRE HARDENING STANDARDS TO CUT BACK BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WE'VE INCREASE ASTRINGENCY THE STANDARDS FOUR TIMES OVER THE PAST DECADE. OR WORKING ON THE NEXT SET OF INCREASES IT'LL TAKE A FACT IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE. THE STANDARDS ARE INCREDIBLY INFECTED -- IN REDUCING THE TIME IT TAKES FOR FIRE TO PENETRATE THE STRUCTURE. BUT THE EFFECTIVENESS DROPS LIKE A ROCK WHEN WE DON'T HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND SO A. B. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SIX TO ADDRESS THAT BY ESTABLISHING A MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT OF THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS. FOR TWO DECADES BUT HAVEN'T BEEN RABIDLY ENFORCED OUT THROUGHOUT THE JURISDICTIONS ALSO THE FIVE FOOT -- BUCK TURNS PERIMETER WE'RE ALREADY WORKING ON THE BUILDING STANDARD TO ADDRESS THAT -- ALSO OF THE VIRUS MODEL -- WE'RE LOOKING VERY MUCH FORWARD TO THAT'S GONNA HELP US WITH BOTH THE EXISTING AND A NEW CONSTRUCTION -- BUT TO SPEAK TO THAT ARE FORMER STATE FARMERS OKAY DARKENED EYES HERE THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WELCOME IS STARTING. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HERE TO SPEAK TODAY ALSO BOTH FORMER CALIFORNIA STATE FIRE MARSHALL AND A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIRE SAFE COUNCIL WHICH IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SO I AM HERE TODAY TO TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS THE RISK MODEL AND SUBSEQUENT RISK MAPS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED IN HER INFORMATIONAL HEARING THIS SPRING. THAT THERE WAS A GAP. AND SHE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. TO CONSTRUCT A RISK MODEL. FOR THE STATE AND THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES OWN MAPPING AND MODEL THAT WE CURRENTLY USED TO DETECT ARE WILD FIRE HAZARD IS GREAT BUT IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO SERVE. IN MITIGATION FUNDS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS. WE NEED A TOOL TO BE ABLE TO METRIC WHAT THAT RISK EFFECTIVENESS IS ARE WE CHANGING OUR RISK ARE WE BUYING DOWN RISK. PUBLICALLY VETTED MODEL DONE THROUGH STATE AGENCY WILL GIVE US A COMMON BASIS BY WHICH TO EVALUATE THAT RISK. THAT EXPENDITURE THERE OR HAVING AND TELL US OVER THE YEARS AHEAD WHETHER WE ARE ACHIEVING THE EFFECTIVENESS THAT WE WANT SHOULD WE NOT ENACT. THIS TYPE OF PROVISION SHOULD WE NOT HAVE A PUBLICALLY VETTED RISK MODEL IT WILL FALL TO THE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRIVATE MODELS. EACH INDEPENDENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR INSURANCE COMPANY OR DIFFERENT ENTITY WILL PUT OUT THERE AND THEN WE WILL START ARGUING ABOUT WHAT THE MODEL VALIDITY IS NOT WHETHER THE MEDICATIONS ARE EFFECTIVE. SO THIS IS -- GET AHEAD OF THE GAME PROPOSAL THIS AMENDMENT I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES OF THE LEGISLATION AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN. ARE AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO MY SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. TWO OTHERS IN SUPPORT HERE TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON NEARLY GOVERNOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WHILE WE'RE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANKS SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR IN TAYLOR WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. AND WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT INSURERS WITH EXPERTISE IN. WALL VIRUS MANAGEMENT. TO THE MODEL AND APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS ON THE BILL AND I THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT HAVE THAT INFORMATION THAT PARCEL BASED. AND COMMUNITY BASED RISK INFORMATION TO HELP US MAKE BETTER DECISIONS. WELL IT WHILE I HAVE YOU THERE. IS THE IS THE IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW DO YOU ALL HAVE INDIVIDUALLY WOULD SAY WITHIN VARIOUS. PLANS THIS KIND OF PARTIAL LEVEL ANALYSIS NOW UNFORTUNATELY DOWN THAT'S PART OF THE BIG DEBATE RIGHT NOW WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MITIGATION AND AND SORT OF THE WHOLE NON RENEWAL ISSUE. PART OF THAT IS THAT INSURERS DON'T HAVE THAT PARCEL LEVEL DATA TO MAKE THOSE TYPE OF REGULAR DECISIONS AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO WORK TOWARDS GETTING THAT DATA. TO FURTHER THE DISCUSSION ON THIS THIS YEAR AND CAN YOU FORESEE IF IF WE DO GET TO THAT KIND OF MODEL AND FOLKS ARE MAKING THOSE AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS AT THEIR HOMES FOR HARDENING OR EDUCATION MANAGEMENT. THAT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE MEANINGFUL THEN TO THEM ON THEIR INSURANCE WHETHER ON RENEWALS OR CANCELLATIONS I MEAN COULD WE CAN YOU ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE. THAT RISK BY DOWN WILL ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON RATE CERTAINLY HOPE SO I MEAN THAT BE THE GOAL RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA AND WE LACK IT AND SO -- HOPING THAT WITH THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE GRANULAR DECISIONS. THANK YOU. THANKS ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORT. DAUGHTER MOM ON BEHALF OF THE MID PENINSULA REGIONAL OPEN SPACE DISTRICT IN SUPPORT THANKS SO MUCH. AND ALSO BE OFFICE HERE COMPOUND FOR HIS PART. THANK YOU. LIZ FORSBERG COME OUT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. GO FAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND SUPPORT. MUCH. YEAH NIKOLINA NONE AS WITH ANY -- GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY IN SUPPORT VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT SEEING NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT DO WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN MILLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION HAS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT. WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH A PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT IMPLICATES ORCHARDS AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATION OF ISSUE IN RECOGNITION. OF ORCHARDS AND A START FIRE SO -- WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THE MATTER QUICKLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE AUTHOR AND ARE ALL. THANK YOU -- SEEING NO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE MEMBER. SURPRISED HERE. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING BELL ARE YOU TAKING IN THE MEN'S TODAY OR YOUR MEANING THE BILL LATER OR WE WEREN'T GIVEN ANY AMENDMENTS FROM THIS% COMMITTEE WE'RE GOING T CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WITH THE FARM BUREAU AND I'M I'M YOU KNOW VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE. TO COME UP WITH AMENDMENTS WITH THEM TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS OKAY WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR. OKAY SAUSAGE I'M GONNA SUPPORT. ENERGY OKAY SIZE -- IS A GO TO JUDICIARY ACTUALLY. WILL SIT ON THE FLOOR OKAY SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT TODAY UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING THAT. AND I BELIEVE EVERYBODY SO -- THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND SHOULD THERE BE. A TRAPPER TWENTY FOR A MOMENT. WANT TO JOIN YOU THE CO AUTHOR PRINCIPLE CO I I I THINK THIS IS LYNCH BEEN TO THE ENTIRE FIRE. BACKAGE BUT A YEAR. GRAVE MISTAKE IF WE PROCEED ON OTHER ISSUES AROUND. TO THE LIABILITY AND YOU KNOW FUND CONSTRUCTION IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY EMPOWER [inaudible] HOMEOWNERS REALTORS BUILDERS LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO ACTUALLY GO MITIGATE THE RISK AND NOT JUST BE PASSIVE. IN THE FACE THIS FIRE WE'VE GOT EMPOWER FOLKS IN [inaudible] I I'M. MY ONLY CONCERN IS IS DOESN'T GO QUICKLY ENOUGH. IS HOW LONG IS THIS MODEL AND TAKE. AND HOW LONG ARE WE GONNA TAKE TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE BECAUSE EVEN IN JURISDICTIONS WE HAVE STRONG DEFENSIBLE SPACE. IMPORTS MINCE YOU KNOW LUMPY. EVEN YOU KNOW LOOK AT LA COUNTY RIGHT I MEAN. WE HAVEN'T SEEN NEARLY LEVEL COMPLIANCE ON PRIVATE LANDS IT THAT WE KNOW WE NEED AND AND FRANKLY THE CAL FIRE FEEL MITIGATION. STRATEGY THUS FAR IT'S BEEN VERY BIG TREE FOLK. AND WHILE THEIR EIGHT ME NO THERE'S BIG ISSUES IN THE NORTH COAST FOR ALL THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS HERE AND TENDONS. WE HAVE HUGE ISSUES YOUR HILLSIDE COMMUNITIES AND CHAPARRALS AND WHILE THEY IN URBAN INTERFACE SO. I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT. WE'RE GONNA LEAVE FOLKS PASSIVE HERE SO. I HOPE WE CAN FIND A WAY TO A SORT OF IS THERE IN YOUR OPINION IS THERE A WAY. TO YOUR SHORTTERM WAY TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THE GAMES YOU WANT TO BE ACHIEVING HERE AS OPPOSED TO SORT OF HAVING A MULTI YEAR PROCESS MISTER ROEMER AT ANY AYE AYE ANDERSON THE CODE PROCESS. TAKES A WHILE TO DEVELOP A JUST. MEANINGFUL DATA THE BILL TO GET TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO REALTORS AND THE FIVE FOOT CLEARANCE WERE ALREADY WORKING ON THAT -- THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A WILD AND URBAN TASK FORCE THAT'S BEEN IN STE IN PROCESS BLAST DECADE. ALREADY WORKING ON THE FIVE PUT PRIMER AFTER SEEING THE BILL EXCELLENT THANK YOU THAT'S SOME GOOD NEWS. I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU MY ESTIMATE ON WHAT IT WILL TAKE YEARS WEISS I DO THINK IT WILL TAKE TWO YEARS TO DEVELOP THE MODEL. AND THREE YEARS FOR A RIGOROUS DATA COLLECTION PROCESS SOME OF WHICH CAN BE PURCHASED AHEAD OF TIME. AND THAT GETS THINGS JUMPSTARTED BUT I DO THINK THAT REALISTICALLY IT WILL TAKE FIVE TO GET IT. TO GET REAL METRICS BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IT IS REALLY. AS AS REALISTIC AS I CAN GIVE YOU MAYBE IT'S NOT GREAT. SO IT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS DURING HIS THEIR POLICIES CANCELED OR YOU ACTUALLY. CAN'T EVEN BUY A HOME BECAUSE THANK GOD A MORTGAGE IS YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AND YOU HAVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS ON OUR HANDS I'M JUST. IF THERE IF THERE ARE EXPEDITED WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE NEAR TERM VERY OPEN TO IT I THINK IS A GOOD STEP TOWARD BUT JUST WANT YOUR FOR THE THINKING ON THAT ANOTHER VICE CHAIR AT I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT'S REALLY AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. COMMENT THAT YOU MADE AND REALLY VERY VERY ASTUTE AND I'M VERY PROUD TO ADD YOU AS A CO AUTHOR SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO THERE'S YOU KNOW THOSE FEW DIFFERENT PIECES HAVING THAT RISK ANALYSIS MODEL IS GOING O BE VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF ALL OF OUR RESILIENCY EFFORTS AND CERTAINLY. WERE A BETTER GUIDE FOR HOMEOWNERS WHEN THEIR PURCHASING PROPERTY FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES WHEN THEY SET RATES ALL OF THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND OR BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE THIS NEW COMBUSTIBLES OWN MAKES A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE SO WE KNOW ABOUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT HOME HARDENING. I FEEL LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK OF THOSE ON TWO DIFFERENT TRACKS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE COME TO REALIZE IS I'VE GOT MORE IN. IN DEPTH IN THIS AREA IS THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE SUCH OUT FOR HOMEOWNERS I DID A TOWN HALL A COUPLE WEEKS AGO MY DISTRICT OF PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP AT THESE TOWN HALLS ARE REALLY YOUR MOST INVOLVED HOMEOWNERS. EASIER H. AWAY PRESIDENT'S THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME THE INFORMATION ABOUT HOME HARDENING THAT WE GAVE. LIKE FLOOR PEOPLE THEY HAD NO IDEA WE HAVE DONE A TERRIBLE JOB AND PUSHING HOME HARDENING INFORMATION OUT PEOPLE EVEN STOP THAT'S PRETTY SIMPLE NO MY HUSBAND'S A LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT HE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT YOU KNOW. THE ABOUT THE AFFECTED SOME OF THESE PLANS COULD HAVE ON A PROBLEM YOU KNOW ON A HOUSE WHEN THEY'RE FOR EVEN FOUR FEET AWAY OR PUT. EVEN SO WE WE ABSOLUTELY LIKE YOU SAID WE SHOULDN'T WASTE ANY TIME TO PUSH THAT INFORMATION OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES ARE. COMFORTABLE TO ADOPT THIS BILL SO WE HAVE THIS NON COMBUSTIBLE ZONE AND THEN TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE QUIPPED TO ENFORCE THESE ZONES. AND TO WORK WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES TO GET COMPLIANCE I'M NOT SAYING GO OUT AND START FINING PEOPLE I'M SAYING GOING OUT TO GO OUT AND IDENTIFY THOSE PROPERTIES IN YOUR CITY AND SAY. YOU HAVE A REAL SAFETY RISK ON YOUR HANDS HOMEOWNER AND HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO A. B. C. AND D.. TO FIX THAT SO THAT WE WERE WE BUILD UP OUR COMMUNITIES WE WERE ABLE TO GET FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO HELP WITH THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S NOTHING WE COULD SPEND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GLENDALE ALONE EASILY GETTING COMPLIANCE I WOULD LIKE IF THE GOVERNOR THERE IS LISTENING OR ANYBODY WHO CARES ABOUT THIS IS LISTENING LET'S GET THE GOVERNOR AT THIS YEAR. ALLOCATE A LOT MORE MONEY TO DEFENSIBLE SPACE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT LOW INCOME HOME OWNERS AND SENIORS WHO CAN AFFORD TO DO THE WORK. THANK YOU ONE TREE OUT CAN COST YOU FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND UP SO WE HAVE TO HELP OUR HOMEOWNERS TO THAT WE HAVE SAFER COMMUNITIES. CLEARLY AGREE MISTER VICE CHAIR. SEGWAYS. GREAT INTO MY QUESTION BECAUSE IN YOUR OPENING YOU MENTIONED YOU -- REDWOOD TREE COMING THROUGH A A DECK. WHICH IS NOT UNCOMMON REDWOODS IN MY DISTRICT UNCOMMON BUT TREES GROWING UP TO THE DECK ARE NOT UNCOMMON -- AND THEN -- YES SIR. THE BILL IS A PROSPECTIVE BUT IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA BE ADDING. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON SITUATIONS LIKE THAT SO. HOW HOW DO YOU ENVISION -- THE NINETEEN YOU MENTION FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS REMOVE THE TREE -- AND YOU KNOW SOME SITUATIONS THAT THAT COULD BE ON THE LOW END -- SO HOW DO YOU ENVISION THIS. IMPACTING SOME IS GONNA HAVE TO REMOVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT ARE NOT HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT LIKE WHO'S GONNA GO TELL GRANDMA SHE'S GONNA TAKE OUT A ROSE BUSHES YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS IS NOT GONNA BE EASY I I YOU KNOW WE GOT THAT. AND THAT'S WHY WE DO HAVE THIS PROCESSES ARE COMING UP WITH REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES AND WE ALSO HOPE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND THE FLEXIBILITY OF SAYING YOU KNOW MAYBE THE ROSE BUSH AND STAY. BUTYOU HAVE YOU GOT SOMETHING THAT'S CLEARLY A HAZARD. AS A HOMEOWNER YES MAYBE THAT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS PAINFUL BUT A LOT MORE PAINFUL AND MINE WAS A EUCALYPTUS SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A BOMB READY TO GO OFF. WHAT'S MORE PAINFUL IS IF THAT BOMB HAD GONE OFF AND I LOST MY WHOLE HOUSE SO REALLY EDUCATING PEOPLE AS TO WHY THEY SHOULD WANT. TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT BECAUSE THE BIGGER INVESTMENT IS THERE IS THERE HOME. AND THEIR FAMILIES SAFETY INSIDE OF IT AND SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW WE DO THIS SO PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT'S PUNITIVE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND. THAT -- THERE'S A RATIONALE BUT THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE FINANCIAL TOOLS TO HELP HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE YOU KNOW EVEN MODERATE INCOME BE ABLE TO CLICK TO TO COMPLY. THANK YOU AND IF WE CAN GET THAT DONE IN THE NEXT. SESSION BEFORE YOU KNOW. BUDGET ROOM THERE'S STILL SOME PARTS OF FUNDING SO. I THINK THERE'S A BIG OPPORTUNITIES AT EVERY HEARD THE WOULD BILL EARLIER ON HOME HARDENING AS WELL. AT FUNDING FILL OUT THE BUDGET. HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LONG TERM RESILIENCE CANCEL OUT IN THE BUDGET FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER. WE GOT GAPS YOU GOT FILM NOW THOUGH. I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION YEAH RIGHT. I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. MOVIE MILL OKAY TO TO MOTIONS FROM THE VICE CHAIR MOTIONS TO PASS TO ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS. THIS CALL THE ROLL -- STERN. SORRY WE'RE ON AB. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEAH NO THAT'S ALRIGHT. YEAH WE GOT CHECK. THE SENATORS STERN BY. I JONES. JONES I ALLEN ORANGES CABALLERO.

AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS HOW WILL BE AS QUICK AS I CAN FIRST I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF. WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WITH US I CONSIDER THIS ONE OF OUR SERVER BILLS THAT SAID AFTER. BUT WE DO HAVE AN OUNCE OF EARLY IN THE WAY. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER CONSERVATION AND WE ARE LUCKY TO BE IN RICH WITH THE BEAUTIFUL PACIFIC COASTLINE AND AN OCEAN THAT CONTRIBUTES. MIGHTILY TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY HOWEVER COASTAL EROSION AND THE PROLIFERATION OF POLLUTION THREATEN HEALTH OF OUR OCEAN IN OUR ENVIRONMENT EVERY. EVERY DAY AB SEVEN NINE SEVENTY FIVE WILL ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA CULTURAL LINES IN AN ADAPTATION LEADERSHIP AND COORDINATION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS ACT REQUIRES THE SECRETARY OF NATURALIZATION SEE TO COLLABORATE WITH OUTSIDE NATIONS TO SUPPORT. AND PROMOTE THE GOALS POLICIES AND BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES RELATING. TO GLOBALLY SHE OUR GLOBAL GLOBALLY SHARED OCEAN RESPECTIVELY THE SECRETARY. CURRENTLY OVERSEES PROTECTION OF THE OCEAN AND COAST WITH THE HELP OF STATE AGENCIES AND OUTSIDE PARTNERS HE'S COLLABORATED THESE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS. ARE STRICTLY WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE AN OCEAN I ENDED TAX ONLY OUR CAR BECAUSE IN OUR OCEAN -- BUT THEN AND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT. IN STATUTE FOR THE SECRETARY TO COLLABORATE WITH AND COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS IN A SOME NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS NAY STATES OTHER OTHER OTHER FOLKS OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF CONSERVING CORAL REEFS WHICH IS ACTUALLY BIG ISSUE WOULD BEEN DEALING WITH YOU SEEN THE STATE OF HAWAII THAT'S BàN. A LOT OF SUNSCREENS BECAUSE OF OF BLEACHING AGREES. OCEAN MONITORING AND CONTINUED EFFORTS IN SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES I AN OFFSETTING THREATS POSED BY OFFSHORE DRILLING IN THE GROWING REAL GROWING MILLION MARINE POLLUTION SPECIFICALLY SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE. ARE CHOKING OUR OCEAN -- SO BASICALLY THIS BILL JUST SAYS COLLABORATE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT THERE'S MORE CONSISTENCY IN POLICY NOT JUST IN TERMS OF OVER DOING IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT IMPACT US BUT SO THAT WE CAN BE A LEADER IN PROVIDING IDEAS AND HELP TO OTHER NATIONS AND OTHER. STATES AND AND HAVE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH JED THEM AND US. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOTH.

THE NOTION OF AS HE TALKS ABOUT IN DEALS WITH CLIMATE ADAPTATION OR IS IT RESILIENCY OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS DESPERATELY NEEDED WHETHER THAT'S JUST. THE STATE'S UP THE COAST FOR MEXICO BELOW FOR THE PACIFIC RIM. WE DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE WAY WE DO WITH ADAPTATION ESPECIALLY AROUND OUR OCEANS BEYOND CALIFORNIA. PUTTING IN STATUTE THAT THE SECRETARY IS PERSON YOU SHOULD BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

MARCOS IN OUR OCEAN RESOURCES IN THIS STATE HOW BIG OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT IT'S GONNA HAVE AN ECONOMY'S LOCALLY SO -- WE GOT TO TRY TO FIND TOOLS TO ACTUALLY GET AHEAD OF THIS BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT STEP SO -- WITH THAT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY I NEED YOUR CLOTHES BACK WESTERN I'VE OPENED VERY GOOD. SENATE STERN VICE STERN AYE JONES ALLEN BUDGET. THAT WE ARE OF AYE HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON IMANI [inaudible] THANK YOU -- HOLDEN. LAST MAN SITTING. GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME THANK YOU. WE'RE ON ITEM. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN TWENTY I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE. AFTER WORKING SO DILIGENTLY WITH US -- WE ARE HERE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS [inaudible] AS PRESENTED. I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS. THAT WE HAVE REMOVED ALL KNOWN OPPOSITION FROM. TO THIS BILL. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OLDER TENSELY LEAKING OIL AND GAS WELLS IN CALIFORNIA. SOME OF THE SITES ARE IDLE DESERTED OR HAZARDOUS AND THOSE ARE THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL. LIKE ACTED PRODUCTION SITES IDLE DESERTED AND HAZARDOUS OIL AND GAS WELLS CAN LEAK POLLUTION. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A PAIR OF IDLE. OIL AND GAS WELLS WERE FOUND LEAKING HAZARDOUS LEVELS OF GAS IN ECHO PARK NEIGHBORHOOD IN LOS ANGELES. LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET FROM NEARBY RESIDENTS. IN ADDITION EARLIER THIS YEAR AND OIL OLD OIL WELL IN MARINA DEL REY. EXPERIENCE RELEASE DURING REMEDIATION WORK. POTENTIAL EMISSIONS FROM IDA WELLS INCLUDE METHANE AND BENZENE METHANE IS A CLIMATE CHANGE GAS MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL. THAN CARBON DIOXIDE WELL OTHER CO ADMITTED. AIR POLLUTANTS LIKE BENZENE CAN CAUSE CANCER. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WOULD MAKE THIS INFORMATION ON LEAKS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. CREATING A BODY OF INFORMATION THAT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW IN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE EMISSIONS FROM IDLE. AND DESERTED WELLS. INFORMATION COLLECTED UNDER A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT CAN BE USED TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF THE EMISSIONS FROM ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S OIL AND GAS WELLS. IN CLOSING I'LL IN DESERTED WELLS CAN AND DO LEAGUE AND WHEN THEY DO THEY CAN WROTE RESULT IN EMISSIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND ENDANGER THE PUBLIC HEALTH. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT SIX TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE CREATING A SCIENTIFIC STUDY. OF THESE WELLS AND REQUIRES THE DATA COLLECTED TO BE MADE PUBLIC. I HAVE WITH ME TIM O'CONNOR FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND IS IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DR THANK YOU SEVEN HOURS. CHAU CONNOR. IF YOU MISTER CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIM O'CONNOR I'M A SENIOR DIRECTOR AT THE ENVIRONMENT DEFENSE FUND MAWSON APPOINTED MEMBER OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OIL AND GAS STRIKE TEAM. AND WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT THE EMISSIONS FROM ABANDONED AND IDA WELLS IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA. ONE OF THINGS THAT'S CLEAR IN THE MISTER HOLDEN THE STATED IS THAT THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE WELLS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS IT IS ARE BASED ON SCIENCE THAT WE CAN SAY THAT THESE WELLS CAN AND DO LEAK AND SOMETIMES THEY LEAK IN SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES THE JOB. GOVERNMENT NASA HAS DONE A STUDY. IN LOOKING AT THE ATMOSPHERE OVER LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND FOUND ABNORMALLY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF METHANE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. AND THE BY LOOKING AT ISOTOPES IN IN THOSE SAMPLES THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCERN. THAT THERE ARE. WILLING GAS EMISSIONS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO METHANE EMISSIONS ABOVE LOS ANGELES AND AS OF YET THERE IS NO CLEAR INDICATION OF THE SOURCE SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID. THEY'VE SUGGESTED THAT I DON'T HAVE BEEN WELL AS MAY BE PART OF THE CAUSE OF THIS. EVIDENCE FROM LIKE PENNSYLVANIA HAS SUGGESTED THAT IDOL IN A BAND WELLS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION THERE IN PENNSYLVANIA IT'S NEARLY 528% OF THE TOTAL STATES METHANE BUDGET. AND THE INCIDENCE OF VITAL MINERALS LEAKING IS HAS RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THAT. CALIFORNIA WE OF COURSE HAVE A SPECIAL PROBLEM IN THAT WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE SOURCES. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN ONE HUNDRED FEET OR LESS OF AN OLD ABANDONED OR I DON'T WELL WELL. IN A STUDY BY THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCHERS BOARD IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SHOW THAT IN OVER HALF OF THE LEAKS THAT THEY STUDIED. FROM OLD OIL WELLS OVER HALF OF THEM CONTAIN CANCER CAUSING COMPOUNDS AND SO WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THESE. SOURCES IT CAN CREATE EVEN FOR THE PROBLEM. THIS CREATES A STUDY TO EVALUATE THE PREVALENCE OF LEAKAGE OF THESE WELLS AND TO ALLOW THE STATE TO START TO TARGET AND pSTATE RESOURCES. AT BEST WORK TO TARGET THE HIGHEST EMITTING RESOURCES. IN THIS WELL INVENTORY AND TO TARGET OF THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SPENDING CURRENTLY. PLUGGING THE WELLS THAT ARE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. WITHOUT THIS KIND OF INFORMATION CALIFORNIA IS IS FLYING BLIND IN SOME WAYS -- AND WE CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO DEVELOP A TARGETED ASSESSMENT AND TO ALLOW THE STATE'S MORE EFFICIENTLY USE ITS PRECIOUS RESOURCES. THANK US RIVAL VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT TODAY [inaudible] BEING. ONE MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. MANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE ANY IN OPPOSITION OR IN BETWEEN. GOOD AFTERNOON ONCE AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN P. ANTHONY THOMAS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATIONS -- YES WE HAVE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION FORMALLY TO ASSEMBLY BILL -- THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT BUT IF WE COULD THE RICHEST A NOTE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE FOR THE RECORD. AND I REQUEST SAID TO THE AUTHOR IT BE SO INCLINED -- ARE OF CONCERN WAS THAT A RELATED TO COST OF THE STUDY. IN A RELEASE. THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION PRIOR. HOW TO RELEASING A REPORT? OUR REQUEST IS THAT IF IN FACT STAKEHOLDERS COM SHOULD SEE COULD SEE THAT INFORMATION INFORMATION. AS A WAY TO ENSURE ITS ACCURACY. AND NOT. THIRD PARTIES TO TAKE DATA OUT OF CONTEXT. AND TO MISINFORM THE PUBLIC IF THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED. ME LIKE THIS REALLY HEAR IT N. TO HEAR HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE. AND SUPPOSE IS FINE WITH THE LANGUAGE -- WE LIKE TO KNOW WHO WOULD BE ACTUALLY A PART OF THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS AS WELL. WE THINK WE HAVE THAT TO THAT RIGHT TO KNOW SINCE TALK IS GOING TO BE MY MEMBERS WELLS IT'S GOING TO BE INSPECTED. BY IF DEPENDING STUDY INCLUDES TESTING THE VAPORS OF WILL HAVE TO REQUEST. THAT THE TESTING SHOULD ALSO IDENTIFY HOW FAR AWAY FROM THE WELL -- THAT THE SAMPLES WERE ACTUALLY TAKEN. I WOULD MAKE THIS REQUEST BECAUSE A SAMPLE TAKEN AT THE WAR OF THE WELL NOT BE THE SAME AS IT BEING FURTHER AWAY. FROM THE BORE ON THESE TESTS PROVIDE WE THINK THE SAME RESULT AS A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN THAT WAS IN FACT -- I CHECKED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA AND OF COURSE A STATS PROGRAM. SO WHILE WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE STUDY MAY BE DUPLICATIVE -- WERE FINE WITH TO STUDY BUT WITH THOSE MINOR REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR WE WHICH IS FAST -- AND FROM THAT STANDPOINT. WE STAND ON OPPOSED TO THE BILL A VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANY IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE DIETS QUESTION ALMOND -- THANK YOU THANK MEASURE HERE -- IMMENSE LOOKS SOUND -- THANK YOU STAFF FOR DOING THE WORK ON THIS. AS A NOTE. YOU KNOW NOT JUST ABANDON OIL WELLS WHICH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY BUT ALSO. WE'VE HAD SOME. PROBLEMATIC WELLS IF YOU MAY CALL THEM THAT ITALY SO CANYON WITCHER RIGHT IN THE BACKYARD OF MANY FOLKS OUT THERE. ONE TO GET A SENSE FROM THE SPONSOR OR YOUR YOUR LEAD WITNESS WHAT WE HAD IN HERE. RAISING OUR PRESENCE ALL THE WAY FROM LOS ANGELES -- I I KNOW YOU GUYS BEEN WORKING HIS FUGITIVE EMISSIONS ISSUE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. YOU SEE THIS. SECTOR YOU WANT TO CALL THAT AS ANGELI SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF OVERALL FUGITIVE EMISSIONS IN THE STATE THAT WE'RE NOT TRACKING FROM. HI BLINDS OTHERS SORT OF LEAKY INFRASTRUCTURE. COULD THIS BE. NICOLE HE SAID THAT. I THINK IT REALLY GOT IN THE AGGREGATE. METHANE EMISSIONS FROM OIL AND GAS ARE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF OF METHANE EMISSIONS A CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS. WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE EMISSIONS THAT ARE -- CO LIMITED WITH THINGS LIKE BENZENE AND OTHER AIR TOXICS. WE ALSO HAVE SOURCES OF POLLUTION THAT ARE IN MANY PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS IN SO THE DATA SHOWS THAT THERE ARE SOME WELLS THAT ARE LIKELY TO COMMIT A LOT. AND OTHER WELLS THAT ARE LIKELY TO OMIT NONE OR LITTLE WE JUST REALLY HAVE NO WAY OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT SORT OF ATTRIBUTES OF THESE WELLS CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE. LEAKAGE RATES AND SO WE ARE UNABLE TO KNOW HOW LARGE OF A PROBLEM IT IS WE DO KNOW IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM -- BUT THERE THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF GAS PRODUCTION BY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE OF WE HAVE A LOT OF HEAVY OIL PRODUCTION. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MORE DRY GAS PRODUCTION. IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT TYPE OF WELL YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND I DO THINK THAT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THIS DATA AND YOU START TO EVALUATE. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEATHER OUT THERE YOU'LL SEE THAT PROBABLY IN SOME WELLS IS SIGNIFICANT ANOTHER WELL AS IT IS LESS SO WE JUST HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING AT THIS. MOMENT. WE CAN'T MANAGE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HERE SO YET SENATOR. MISTER CHAIR AND I I JUST REALIZED THAT THAT I DIDN'T HEAR A RESPONSE FROM THE AUTHOR IN REGARDS TO THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY SYFY -- ONE BY ONE WITH THE COST OF THE STEADY BUT THE OTHER ONE IS A STAKEHOLDERS BEING ALLOWED TO SEE THE REPORT. AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAD AN ANSWER THAT. I THINK. I HAVE TO GO BACK AND BUT MOST OF WHAT I THOUGHT I HEARD A SAID. IS IN THE IS IN THE BILL -- SO. HEY YOU KNOW WITHOUT GOING BACK AND SERVE.
