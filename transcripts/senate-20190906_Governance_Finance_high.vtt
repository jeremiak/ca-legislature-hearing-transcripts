IN A TURN OVER THE COMMITTEE.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:22.989
ON THE ISSUE RETURN TO SOURCE

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.523
THIS WAS A- A REALLY BIG

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.593
DISCUSSION FOR. A FEW WEEKS

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.429
DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:31.597
I THINK THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:33.666
STRIKE A BALANCE. WE'RE ABLE TO

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.468
KEEP THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:37.737
BAY AREA. SAN JOSE OAKLAND AND

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.672
SAN FRANCISCO. CONTINUE TO SEE

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:42.241
MONEY FLOW DIRECTLY BACK. BUT

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.909
WE ALSO HEARD FROM SOME SMALL

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:46.078
CITIES THAT SAID THAT. THEY MAY

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.513
NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.049
DOLLARS. THAT MAY BE FLOWING

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:52.852
BACK. AND CANDIDLY. I THOUGHT

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.453
WE NEEDED TO BE A TO DO MORE.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.855
SO WE TOOK A DATA DRIVEN

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:59.358
APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:10:59.425 --> 00:10:59.959
ISSUE OF RETURN TO SOURCE. IN

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:03.496
WHAT WE. ENDED UP SAYING IS IF

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:05.898
THERE IS ANY CITY THAT HAS OVER

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.500
30% OF THE ENTIRE FOR WHAT

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:09.769
HOUSING STOCK. WITHIN THEIR

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.137
COUNTY THEY WOULD GET DIRECT

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:13.939
RETURN TO SOURCE SO THAT WOULD

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.408
MEAN LIKE FOR EXAMPLE SANTA

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:17.977
ROSA WHO IS 54% OF ALL

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:19.645
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.213
COUNTY CINEMA WOULD ALSO BE

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.916
ELIGIBLE. THAT WOULD MEAN NAPA

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:26.452
WHAT HAS 53% OF ALL FOR MY

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.586
HOUSE IN THE COUNTY WOULD GET

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:30.056
THAT DIRECT. BUT THE COUNTY

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:30.689
WOULD WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:32.525
THOSE SMALLER CITIES THAT WAS A

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.293
BIG ISSUE WHICH I THINK THAT WE

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.227
ARE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:36.128
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:39.165
SOME. WHO WILL STILL HAVE SOME

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.434
CONCERNS IN THE OTHER ITEM I

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.536

HOUSING. IS THAT THIS WAS VERY

00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:00.453
LAST MINUTE AND DO BELIEVE THAT

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:02.421
THOSE CONCERNS CAN BE WORED

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:05.191

BE PUT ON TO THE BALLOT BY A

DISCUSSED PUBLICLY AND

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.617
ULTIMATELY WHAT ENDS UP IN

DETERMINE AN EXPENDITURE PLAN.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.944
AND THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.112

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:28.520
OBVIOUSLY WITH THEIR CITIES UP

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:30.155
FOR THAT PART OF MONEY. OKAY

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:30.989
THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:33.125
PUBLIC HEARING EACH COUNTERACT

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:36.829

AGREED TO IT. I WAS AT WORK.

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:47.373
YEAH I THINK THAT EXPENDITURE

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:48.707
PLAN WOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO BE

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.976
CONFIRMED THAT IT'S COMPLETED

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:51.543
BUT IT'S WITH REGARD TO THE

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.079
DISCRETION OF THE COUNTY. OKAY

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:58.317
SO THAT WAS SOMETHING. MAYBE

00:16:58.384 --> 00:16:59.451
THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING A

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:01.120
CERTAIN WAY THEY CAN DO IT

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:04.056
WITHOUT HAVING DOT OVER WRITTEN

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.791
BY THE REGIONAL BODY THAT'S

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.560
RIGHT THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY

00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:09.194
WITH THE TERMS OF THIS BILL BUT

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:12.398
YES. OKAY YEAH. AND OKAY SO THE

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:16.168
COUNTY WOULD HAVE THE SPECIFIC.

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:16.735
ALLOCATION YOU KNOW LIKE IF

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:22.174
THERE IS. TWENTY TWO CITIES.

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:24.276
AND THEY WANTED TO ALLOCATED TO

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.345
ALL TWENTY TWO CITIES THANKS TO

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:29.048
THAT OUT OR THEY CAN ALLOCATED

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:32.818
TO PROJECTS OR COULD THEY ARE

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:33.419
THEY ALLOCATED TO PROJECTS OR

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:37.356
TO COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE LIKE

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:37.990
IS THERE LIKE ASSEMBLY COMES AT

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:41.059
AN ONCE. ROGER TO APPROVED DO

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:42.261
THEY ALLOCATED TO THAT ORDER

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:44.496
THE ALLOCATED TO THE CITIES AND

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:45.063
THEN THE CITY'S ALLOCATED TO

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:50.035
THE PROJECTS. ALL THIS CAR.

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:51.537
IT'S ACTUALLY AS IT'S AS THE

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.439
COUNTY SEE FIT OF THEIR

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:54.506
PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE LIKELY

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:57.376
BROUGHT FORWARD BY CITIES BUT

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:58.544
GENERALLY WOULD BE EITHER

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:03.715
PROJECTS OR CITIES OKAY. AND.

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:05.184
MESSAGE QUESTIONS GET A CLEARER

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.021
SO IF THE COUNTY WATER TO

00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:11.857
ALLOCATED TO A HOUSING TRUST

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.559
DIRECTLY TO THE ALLOCATED TO

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:16.662
HOUSING TRUST. IF THEY WANTED

00:18:16.728 --> 00:18:17.796
TO DO THAT IS THAT ALLOWED

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:20.599
UNDER THE I BELIEVE THAT IS I

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:21.533
JUST WANT TO CONFIRM MY STAFF

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.569
IS CONFIRMING THAT YES THERE'S

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.604
A LOT OF CASES ARE COUNTY WOULD

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:26.238
PROBABLY JUST OUT. YOU KNOW THE

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:27.506
SMALLER CITIES. THE WOULD

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:31.810
PREFER. TO NOT BE IN CHARGE OF

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:33.612
MANAGING THE MONEY AND DOING

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:34.213
ALL THE PROCESS THEY DID TURN

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.747
IT OVER TO THE- ON A HOUSING

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:39.451
TRUST. THEN THE COUNTY HOUSING

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:42.120
TRUST WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT.

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:43.722
ALLOCATED TO AND REVIEW THE

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.023
PROJECTS AND THEN ALLOCATE THE

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.625
MONEY TO THOSE AND THAT'S

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:48.594
EXACTLY WHY ACER REQUIRE AND I

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.162
HAD HAD HAD THOUGHT THAT THE

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:51.530
FORMULA MADE SENSE FOR THE SOME

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:52.564
OF THE LARGEST CITIES TO

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:53.899
RECEIVE A DIRECT ALLOCATION BUT

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.234
OTHERWISE TO GIVE THE COUNTIES

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.301
THE DISCRETION TO FIGURE OUT

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:58.036
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY. TO GET

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:00.272
IT TO THE PROJECTS THAT WOULD

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:00.906
BEST HELP BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.040
THERE ARE MANY CITIES AS YOU

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:03.275

AND MY ISSUE IS THAT I'M NOT

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:02.701
FAMILIAR WITH THE PLAYERS IN

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:03.702

WHICH PROBABLY THE- THE

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:16.381
COMPARABLE. TO WHAT WE'RE

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:17.649

HAVE TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:39.738
AND I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT A

00:25:39.804 --> 00:25:41.172
BOTTOM UP VERSUS THE TOP DOWN.

00:25:41.239 --> 00:25:42.040
MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO GO BOTTOM

00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:43.041
UP THAN THAT. YOU KNOW HAVEN'T

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:44.175

BUT I'M- I'M I'M A LITTLE.

00:25:46.444 --> 00:25:47.746

I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TIME

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.725
YEARS TO WATCH IT FAIL OR

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:03.495
SUCCEED. BECAUSE OF THE NEEDS

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:05.163
