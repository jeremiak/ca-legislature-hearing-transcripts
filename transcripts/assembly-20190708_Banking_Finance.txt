TO WHENEVER THAT WAS IN MY TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWO YEARS AGO -- YEAH I WAS LIKE HOW LONG WAS IT -- BUT HE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE IN PROVIDING JUST THOUGHT -- A ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE A LOT OF REALLY INCREDIBLE DIALOGUE I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK THAT CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS ARE ALWAYS ON THE SAME PAGE AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF IT IS BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE I WOULD SAY THAT THAT HAS. NOT BEEN THE CASE -- BUT IT'S BEEN SO HEALTHY AND SO GOOD FOR PUBLIC POLICY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHIEF CONSULTANT WHO ENGAGES IN CONVERSATION. WHO WHO REALLY THINKS ABOUT THE ISSUES -- IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND WHO IS AT OPEN. TO WORKING WITH A CHAIR WHO HAS. LOTS OF CONVERSELY AT LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND CONVERSATIONS AND PUSHES BACK ON A REGULAR BASIS JUST AS A FARM TO UNDERSTAND ISSUES AND TO TRY TO MOVE THEM FORWARD SO BILL YOU WILL BE MISSED THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE CALIFORNIA. STATE LEGISLATURE YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE ASSEMBLY FOR HOW MANY TWENTY YEARS AND YOU'VE SERVED IN MANY CAPACITIES AS THAT. I KNOW YOU WERE A CHIEF OF STAFF AT ONE POINT AND YOU KNOW CONSULTANT THREE TIMES THREE DIFFERENT TIMES -- SO HE HE SERVED IN MANY SO THANK YOU BILL FOR YOUR SERVICE AND WE WILL MISS YOU. AND SO. WITH THAT I WILL HAVE THE TO THE AUTHOR OF THE SP FOUR SEVEN TWO AND BEGIN IT WITH -- PRESENTING HER BILL THANK YOU CENTER CAPITAL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR -- PRESENT MY BELT FIRST LET ME THINK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS DILIGENT AND AND HARD HARD WORK OF ON THE BALLOT. FOR WORKING OVER THE FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND -- TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT -- AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE IN THE JUDICIARY STAFF COMMITTEE FOR THEIR THEIR HARD WORK IS AS WELL IT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO PREPARE THE AMENDMENTS IN HERE THE BILLS. THE BILL INTO COMMITTEES -- IN ONE WEEK SO MY OFFICE IN THE STAFF ABOUT THE BANKING IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE COMMITTEES CONDUCTED A ROW BY STATE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS INVOLVING LABOR ORGANIZATION. CONSUMER GROUPS EARNED WAGE ACCESS PROVIDERS AND ANYBODY INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT -- IS SO THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH A BOMB LOW COST LOW RISK WAGE AND WORK BASE ADVANCES. FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS REFLECTING THIS STAKEHOLDER INPUT WE WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED IN. IN PAGES SEVEN THROUGH NINE OF THE ANALYSIS AMONG OTHER THINGS OTHER THINGS THE AMENDMENTS WELL. NUMBER ONE IMPOSE DPO OVERSIGHT THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. ON EARNED WAGE ACCESS PROVIDERS INCLUDING REGISTRATION AND DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. AND CONSUMER COMPLAINT PROCESSES AND TRACKING WILL CREATE WORKER PROTECTIONS INCLUDING STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND TOUGHER NON RECOURSE PROVISIONS STRENGTHENING THE BILL'S EXISTING PROHIBITION ON COLLECTION AND CREDIT REPORTING. WILL INCLUDE A THREE YEAR SUNSET TO ENSURE THAT THE STATUTE AND REGULAR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WORKS. AND FINALLY -- WE'VE RESISTED EFFORTS TO WEAKEN THE WORKER PROTECTIONS THE AMENDMENTS WILL RAISE THE MONTH THE MONTHLY CAP ON FEES FROM FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS THAT WORKERS PAY. WORKERS MAYBE CHARGE WHILE MAINTAINING THE ESSENTIAL 50% CAP ON ACCRUED EARNINGS MAY BE EXCESS DURING A PAY PERIOD. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT CASH FLOW EMERGENCY SITUATIONS THE AMENDMENTS WILL RELAX A 50% CAP BY ALLOWING IT TO BE. A TO BE EXCEEDED UP TO TWICE EVERY SIX MONTHS. WITH THAT -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT PARTY SEVENTY TWO YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS SO LET ME TELL YOU WHICH PROVIDE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO REGULATE EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS. EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS ALLOW CONSUMERS TO ACCESS A PORTION OF THE WAGES THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY EARNED PRIOR TO THEIR SCHEDULE PAYDAY. HERE IS HOW IS SIMPLE PROGRAM WORKS A CONSUMER REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO HIS OR HER MONEY THE EMERGENCY COMES UP. USING AN APP THE CONSUMER CAN QUICKLY ACCESS UP TO HALF OF THE AMOUNT OF HIS OR HER EARNED AND PAID INCOME DURING A GIVEN PAY PERIOD FOR A SINGLE FIXED FEE. IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY'RE PAID ON A WEEKLY BASIS IT MEANS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK THEY NEED SOMEONE IF THEY'RE PAID ON A BI WEEKLY BASIS AFTER THE FIRST WEEK THEY THEY BURNT INCOME IF THEY GETPAID ON THE A MONTHLY BASIS. WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL GET PAID ON YOU CAN ACCESS THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES DURING THE MONTH -- UP TO A 50% OF WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY EARNED. THE FEET THE FEE IS A NON HAS TO BE A NON RECURRING FEE AND IT'S PAID. IS ONLY PAID IF AND WHEN A CONSUMER CHOOSES TO USE THE PROGRAM IN OTHER WORDS YOU HEAR YOU DON'T OFTEN AND YOU PAY MONTHLY -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS YOU ONLY PAY IF YOU USE THE PROGRAM. AND THE FEE IS LESS THAN A TYPICAL BANK OVERDRAFT FEES -- LATE FEE WITH A FEW SCREEN TAPS THE USERS HAVE INSTANT ACCESS TO THEIR ALREADY EARNED UNPAID WAGES. WET WEATHER AS I SAY IT'S TO COVER UNEXPECTED COST OR DEVOID IN LATE -- OVERDRAFT FEE THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS CHARGING. IN FACT 70% OF U. S. HOUSEHOLD LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK CHECK EVEN PEOPLE OF MEANS. FINANCE CHARGES INTEREST PAYMENTS CHECKING CASHING FEES LATE FEES ON MONTHLY BILLS AND OTHER EXPENSES CAN OFTEN RUN AS MUCH AS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS FINANCIAL TAX IS A HIGHLY GREG REGRESSIVE TAX IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO ARE LEAST. ABLE TO PAY. BY CREATING A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR IN EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS WE CAN PROVIDE A SAFE WAY FOR CONSUMERS TO GET THEIR MONEY WHEN THEY NEED IT. IT'S A TOOL FOR PEOPLE TO USE THAT COMES WITH CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY. THE PROTECTIONS IN SB FOUR SEVENTY TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE HELD HARMLESS. IT'S NOT ALONE. USERS CANNOT DEFAULT AND THERE IS NO COMPOUNDING INTEREST THERE IS NO DEBT CREATED FOR CONSUMER ACCESSING THEIR EARNED ON PAID INCOME. AND THERE IS NO INTEREST CHARGED. THERE IS NO RECOURSE AND NO LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF A NON PAYMENT AND THERE IS NO REPORTING OF NON PAYMENT TO A CREDIT BUREAU. IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING SAFE AND INEXPENSIVE WAYS FOR FOLKS TO GET THE MONEY THEY NEED THEN WE MUST CONTINUE TO HAVE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHY I'M THANKFUL TO THE CONSUMER GROUPS AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S -- HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST. MONTH OR SO -- I THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS DAN QUAN WHO MOST RECENTLY SERVED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS SENIOR ADVISER TO THE DIRECTOR RICHARD CORDRAY. AT THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND I JAZZ ANWAR CEO OF PAY ACTIVE. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. PEOPLE CAN HEAR ME. MY NAME IS THEN CALL EITHER BY DESTRUCTIVE INTO COMPANIES INCLUDING PASSIVE. AS CENTER COPYRIGHT MENTIONED MOST RECENTLY I SERVED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS SENIOR ADVISER TO DIRECTOR RICHARD CORDRAY AT THE CFPB WHERE ON THAT THOSE FINTECH OFFICE. ONE OF MY ALL THIS IS KEY ACHIEVEMENTS WAS REALLY TO FACILITATE -- INCOME ACCESS OR EIA INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY THAT DISRUPTS SHORT TERM HI BECAUSE CREDIT PRODUCTS. THE CITY BECAUSE THE EXAM THE AYE PROGRAMS AND CONCLUDED THAT YEAH A IS A CONSUMER FRIENDLY INNOVATION. AS A RESULT IN HIS FINAL PAY THE REAL RELEASE IN LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CFPB CREATED A SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS TO ACCOMMODATE WITH. RESPONSIBLE III MODELS THOSE EXEMPTIONS REQUIRED YEAH I PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE MEANINGFUL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THE PROGRAMS WERE NOT PREDATORY. AND CENTER CUBBY ORAL TO HER CREDIT HAS INCORPORATED MANY SUCH GHARIALS IN HER BILL. OF THE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A FEW KEY POINTS OUT WHAT YEAH I IS AND WHAT HE I IS NOT. FIRST YEAH I IS NOT CREDIT AS EVIDENCED BY THE CBS DECISION TO EXEMPT YA A IN THE PAY THE RULE. NO FUTURE WAGERS ARE IMPLICATED NOTE THAT'S RISKY THAN. OTHER SHORT TERM FINANCIAL -- CREDIT PRODUCTS FIRST BECAUSE NOTE THAT IS CREATED THE CONSUMER DOES NOT ALL WITHIN A CREATED ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDENS FOR THEMSELVES. SECOND THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT YEAH I SHALL BE COMPLETELY NON RECOURSE IF THE CONSUMER FOR WHATEVER REASON OR FOR NO REASON AT FOR NO REASON AT ALL DOES NOT REIMBURSE THE PROVIDER. THE CONSUMER IS HELD COMPETE TODAY HARMLESS THERE'S NO DEBT COLLECTION THERE'S NO REPORTING TO CREDIT BUREAUS. THIRD THIS BILL CAPS THE AMOUNT THE WORKER TAXES IN EACH PAY PERIOD THIS ENSURES THE WORKERS WILL ALWAYS HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE -- ACTUAL PAYDAY TO MEET OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. FINALLY THIS BILL NOT ONLY CONTAINS A PRIVATE RIGHT ACTION BUT ALSO PROVIDES FOR TV -- REGISTRATION OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. THE MAJORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK THEY DESERVE TIMELY SAFE AND AFFORDABLE SMALL DOLLAR FINANCIAL OPTIONS. WOULDRESPECTFULLY ASK FOR SUPPORT I EXTEND MY HEARTFELT THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MS EAGLES ALAR THE CEO OF PASSIVE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU.

AND YOUR COMMITTEE -- STAFF AS WELL AS MR STONE'S COMMITTEE STAFF HAS SPENT THE LAST FOUR WEEKS. WE HAD WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WITH VITAL ONGOING DISCUSSIONS -- IT EVERYBODY'S BEEN VERY ACCESSIBLE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THE WORK -- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS DO WANT TO RAISE A COUPLE OF OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES FROM FROM THE FROM MARK -- CLIENTS PERSPECTIVE WITH REGARDS TO OPERATIONAL ISSUES -- MORE IN TERMS OF HOW THE THE BILL WOULD WORK AND WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROVIDERS MOVING FORWARD -- PROBABLY THE MOST PREDICT THE MOST -- A SIGNIFICANT ONE IS WITH REGARD TO THE THE MEMBERS THAT WERE JUST TAKEN. AS A AS A PERTAIN TO THE BONDING AND INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS AS CURRENTLY ENVISIONED THAT WOULD POSE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN ON OUR CLIENT -- HOPE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE THE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS AND AND WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS AND WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE.

REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ALSO WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE DPO COMMISSIONER IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL LOGIC. AND THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST WITH REGARDS TO THE THE BILL IS CURRENTLY DRAFTER AS WITH THOSE A MEMBERS ARE ACCEPTED -- FINANCIAL PROVIDERS THAT WOULD BE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THIS JURISDICTION WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ABSENT -- HAVING -- ABOUT BEING REGISTERED.

FAMINE I WOULD LET HIM KNOW THAT. THERE IS LIFE AFTER BEING CHIEF CONSULTANT TO THE SOMEONE BANKING COMMITTEE. SO OF AT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I TOO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR YOUR STAFF -- THE SENATE BANKING STAFF SENATE JUDICIARY STAFF I'M SORRY THE SOMEBODY DID YOU SURE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. HERNANDEZ BEEN PLEASED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS -- WE DO HAVE SOME. CONCERNS WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT TODAY AND HERE TO HAVE THE FOUNDER VERNON ROM PALANIAPPAN -- WHO WILL BE TALKING ABOUT -- THE HELL THE COMPANY STARTED THE IMPACT ON CUSTOMERS AND THE CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT IT WAS RUMPLED HAPPENED FOUNDER VERNON. THANK YOU FOR CALLING ON IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND AND WHAT WE STAND FOR AND WHAT WE CURRENTLY OFFER. WE STARTED IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH THE GOAL OF FIGHTING FOR FINANCIAL JUSTICE FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS -- AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THERE'S ALMOST 80% OF THE COUNTRY THAT LIVES PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. AND ABOUT 40% OF THE COUNTRY CANNOT FIND FORTY DOLLARS AN EMERGENCY -- INTO ME IT'S IT'S SO INTERESTING ON ONE AND WE COMPLAIN ABOUT PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND MONEY WHEN THEY HAVE AN EMERGENCY. ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE THIS PAY CYCLE THAT ACTUALLY HOLDS BACK PEOPLE'S WAGES UP TO THE WORK. OF IT SO THAT'S A RESTART OF DOING IS HELPING PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO PAY WHEN THEY NEEDED IT. SINCE THEN WE'VE ACTUALLY EXPANDED OUR SERVICE. A WE HELP PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR BILLS. WE'LL OUT THERE WHEN THE BANK BALANCE IS LOW SO THEY CAN AVOID OVERDRAFT FEES. WE NEGOTIATE MEDICAL BILLS THE MATCH PEOPLE UP WITH FINANCIAL AID SO THAT THEY CAN -- ACTUALLY HAVE THE MEDICAL BILLS PAID OFF. WE ALSO FIND SAVINGS FOR PEOPLE -- WHEN THEIR -- SPENDING. THE PRODUCT WE STARTED WITH ME DOING THIS FOR SOME OF MY OWN EMPLOYEES A PREVIOUS COMPANY THIS BY HAND FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND THEN FINALLY MADE IT INTO A PRODUCT. BECAUSE I SAW HOW DOES HELPING PEOPLE. OUR SERVICE OFFERED A COMMUNITY SUPPORTED WAIT WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY HELP EACH OTHER OUT -- AND WE'VE HAD OVER TEN TEN MILLION THANK YOU MESSAGES GO BETWEEN OUR MEMBERS BECAUSE IT'S A PLATFORM TO COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HELP EACH OTHER OUT. SB FOR SENATOR DEALS WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE -- WHOSE FINANCIAL HEALTH IS VERY FRAGILE. EVEN SMALL CHANGES CAN HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THEIR SITUATION. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ON OF THE CHANGES THAT WE MAKE AND HOW THIS CAN AFFECT PEOPLE. OF THIS I'M GONNA GO OVER MY COMMENTS AND THESE ARE FROM THE VERSION OF THE BILL THAT WE HAD SEEN ON TUESDAY -- SIR FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT OVERALL I THINK THE BILL'S VERY POSITIVE FOR CONSUMERS -- WE APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL RECOGNIZES THAT THE MONEY THAT SOMEBODY HAS ARMED IS ACTUALLY THERE'S AND ACCESSING IT IS NOT ALONE -- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE BILL RECOGNIZES THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER MODEL THAT'S HOW WE GET OUT THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WORK FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND EVEN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES CAN GET ACCESS TO ITS WAS VERY INCLUSIVE IN THAT WAY -- THERE'S A NUMBER OF THE THINGS I LIKE WITH THE BILL BUT I WILL NOT LIST EACH ONE OF THOSE -- WE WOULD BE REMISS OF US NOT TO ADDRESS THE AREAS WHERE WE THINK THERE COULD BE SOME CONSUMER ARM. AND I HAVE -- WE HAVE THREE AREAS OF CONCERN. THE FIRST ONE IS WITH THE WHOLE BACK OF 50% OF WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE OF THE RENT PAYMENTS -- THIS MONTH AS MANY PEOPLE GOT PAID AFTER THE RENT DUE DATE HAS GOT PAID BEFORE THEIR AND YOUR DATE. I'M AND THAT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT ACROSS MONTHS AS TO WHAT YOU'D EXPECT IS THAT ABOUT SIX TIMES A YEAR. PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY RENT BEFORE THEIR PAYDAY -- AND THE CONSTRAINTS WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT TOUGH FOR THEM TO MAKE THEIR OWN PAYMENTS -- RIGHT THROUGH THE YEAR. THE SECOND CONCERN IS ON THE FIXED MONTHLY FEE -- THE CONCERN IS THAT BY FIXING THE MONTHLY FEE IT COULD CONSTRAIN THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PRODUCT. OR COULD AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS LIKE TELLING A GROCERY STORE THAT YOU CAN ONLY JUDGE PEOPLE FIXED AMOUNT PER MONTH. THE GROCERY STORES LIKELY EITHER CUT BACK HOW MUCH THEY LET YOU BUY. OR GIVE YOU WORST QUALITY PRODUCE. AND IN TERMS OF THIS PRODUCT LIKE MONEY TO SEND QUALITY WHATEVER COMES FROM. BUT THE WAY YOU CAN ACT TO CHANGE THE QUALITIES BY EITHER BY CUTTING BACK ON THE SPEED ARE CUTTING BACK ON THE SUPPORT -- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RESTRICT THE AVAILABILITY OF A GOOD PRODUCT A SITUATION LIKE THIS IS PEOPLE GO TO THE BAD PRODUCTS? THE BAD PRODUCTS OVERDRAFT FEES WHICH I THIRTY FIVE BUCKS A TRANSACTION -- THE CFPB STUDY SAID THAT THE AVERAGE TRANSACTION IS ABOUT FIFTY BUCKS SO IT'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS OF FEES FOR FIFTY DOLLAR -- USAGE AND THE OTHER BUT ALTERNATIVE IT IS -- PAYDAY LOANS THE CPP STUDY SO THAT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS ACCESS. SO IT'S ABOUT FIFTY DOLLARS THE TRANSACTION. ON THE PAYDAY LOANS. SO MY CONCERN OUT THERE IS THAT IF WE RESTRICT ABILITY OF THIS PRODUCT. IT WILL FORCE PEOPLE INTO OVERDRAFT FEES AND PAY LOANS. AND OUR ANALYSIS ACTUALLY ESTIMATES THAT THE LIKELY ADDITIONAL FEES BY PEOPLE NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THIS PRODUCT WE'RE GOING THE OTHER PRODUCTS. IS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DOLLARS PER MONTH. THE THIRD CONCERN IS ON THE TWO DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT PRIOR TO A DEBIT. THAT NOTICE -- PETER IS FINE IF THE TRANSACTION HAPPENS MORE THAN TWO DAYS. BEFORE THE DOUBLE DATE -- BUT IF SOMEONE IS MY THE DAY BEFORE PAYDAY. I WOULD STOP TO GIVE THEM TWO DAYS NOTICE. CAUSED YOU TO KNOW TWO DAYS BEFORE THEY WILL USE THE PRODUCT AND HAVING ACCESS TO THEIR PAY THE DAY BEFORE PAYDAY IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT IS THE DAY WHEN THE BAG BOUNCES THE LOWEST -- AND IN A LETTER WE'VE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE USE OUR PRODUCT TO BUY GAS. WE'VE SEEN THAT THE HOURS WORKED PER WEEK GOES UP WITH ALMOST US USING A PRODUCT. PREVIOUSLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THEY WOULD MISS WORK BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT BUY GAS TO GET TO WORK. WANT TO HAVE A PRODUCT THEY BUY GAS TO GET TO WORK THE HOURS THAT THEY WORK UP A WEEK GOES UP. AND THE WAGES GO UP AS WELL -- AND SO WE'D LIKE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE PRODUCT EVEN THE DAY BEFORE PAYDAY -- DE FIX FOR THAT SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE IS IF YOU DO A TRANSACTION MORE THAN TWO DAYS BEFORE THEN YOU WE WILL PROVIDE TO HIS NOTICE. IF YOU DO A TRANSACTION WITHIN THE LAST TWO DAYS WE COULD PROVIDE DOORS AS SOON AS THEY DO THE TRANSACTION. SO I LIKE TO ANYBODY TRADING THAT. pPOSITIVE -- THERE'S A I THINK IF YOU SPECIFIC OPTIONS THAT COULD ACTUALLY MAKE THIS BILL EVEN BETTER. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THAT -- SO MY NAME IS JASON LEE AND ON THE C. E. O. OF DAILY PAY. ONE OF THE INDUSTRY LEADERS IN THIS EMERGING CATEGORY. SO THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED. SUBJECT AREA -- AND IT'S ONE THAT REQUIRES PRECISION IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO GET COMPLETELY RIGHT. SO ALL OF OUR COLLECTIVE NORTH STARS ARE TO SUPPORT A NEW INDUSTRY -- AND THAT INDUSTRY IS MEANT TO PROTECT WORKERS AND GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. NOT UNINTENTIONALLY OPENING THE DOOR FOR PAYDAY LENDERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW LEGISLATION. TO THAT END THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL IS CLOSER. THEN WHERE WE WERE A FEW MONTHS BACK BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME REMAINING ISSUES. ALLOW ME TO HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THEM HERE. SINCE I THOUGHT THAT THERE IS ONLY A TWO MINUTE LIMITATION AB. SO AS DRAFTED. THE BILL LIMITS THE WORKER TO BE ONLY ABLE TO ACCESS 50% OF HER OWN MONEY. SO WE AS A COMPANY AS WELL AS YOUR CONSTITUENTS FIND THIS LIMITATION ARBITRARY -- AND LIKELY PUSHES THEM TO CONTINUE TO USE PAYDAY LOANS. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH WE'VE COLLECTED NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO RESPONSES FROM CONSTITUENTS. IN EACH OF YOUR DISTRICTS IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS REGARDING THIS BILL. AND THEY HAVE SAID QUOTE. IT'S MY MONEY. I BURNED IT. I NEED THIS MONEY TO PAY MY OWN BILLS. NOW WE UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO PROTECT A SMALL MINORITY OF WORKERS FROM QUOTE HAVING NOTHING LEFT ON PAYDAY. IN THE FOUR YEARS OF OFFERING THIS SERVICE ACROSS OVER TEN MILLION PAYMENTS I HAVE NEVER ONCE. SEEN A WORKER WIND UP WITH NOTHING ON PAYDAY. HOWEVER. THERE ARE SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE A WORKER MAY NEED. 55% EACH WEEK. NOW WITHOUT THAT ACCESS TO THAT AMOUNT. THAT WORKER MAY LIKELY BE FORCED TO GO TO A PAYDAY LENDER. NOW WE'VE SUGGESTED A MORE ELEGANT WAY. TO SATISFY BOTH YOUR CONSTITUENTS AS WELL AS A SENATORS CONCERN. AND THAT IS SIMPLY TO ALLOW THE WORKER FULL ACCESS TO OUR OWN MONEY. WITH A SENSIBLE MECHANISM TO RATCHET BACK HER ACCESS 250% IF SHE IS IN FACT FOUND TO HAVE NOTHING LEFT ON PAYDAY. WE SUBMITTED FOR OTHER MODIFICATIONS TO THIS BILL ALL IN THE SAME VEIN. OF SUPPORTING A NEW INDUSTRY WHERE WE CAN PROTECT WORKERS WHILE MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES FOR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND HARM TO THE END CONSUMER. TODAY WE ARE SEEKING A COMMITMENT. FROM THE SENATOR'S OFFICE TO WORK WITH US ON THIS POINTS TO MAKE THIS BILL STRONGER TO MAKE IT BETTER AND TO MAKE IT ACHIEVE THE DESIRED PURPOSES. ANY OTHER WINNERS THE STATE YOUR NAME AND POSITION MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THAT HAVE BECOME OUT THE NATIONAL PAYROLL REPORTING CONSORTIUM WERE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL WE PARTICIPATE IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. APPAREL COMPANIES ARE NOT PROVIDERS OF EARNED INCOME ACCESS BUT WERE NECESSARY PARTNERS PARTICULARLY ON THE EMPLOYER CITED MODEL SO WE APPRECIATE THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION THAT PAYROLL COMPANIES ARE NOT PROVIDERS. WE MAY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL TWEAKS THE LANGUAGE BUT WE DO. APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE -- THUS FAR WE AGREE THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH GREAT POTENTIAL WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT WE'RE COMMITTED TO SPEND THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT THANK YOU. DO YOU FEEL LOW ON BEHALF OF BRIDGET I AM CHAIR MEMBERS AUTHORS ABSOLUTE PRECIADO. THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF WORK HAS GONE INTO THE BILL TOWARD STRENGTH IN IT -- SPECIFIC TO BRIDGET WE ARE ANTICIPATING LANGUAGE RELATED TO NON RECOURSE LIQUIDITY -- LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE THAT AS THAT COMES ABOUT THANK YOU. TO ST MARTIN DOUBLE CONSUMER REPORTS SKEWS ME WE HAVE ALSO HAVE NO FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO LEGISLATION THUS FAR BUT FROM THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS MULTIPLE COMMITTEES. I WE CONTINUE TO HAVE OVERARCHING CONCERN THAT AS THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO RECOGNIZE AN EMERGING MARKET THERE IS APPROPRIATE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT REGIME AND THAT THERE'S TRANSPARENCY AND DATA -- AND ARE HEARTENED TO SEE THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT THAT IS IN THE BILL AS WELL BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH. AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS PROTECTIVE OF CONSUMERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WERE ALSO NEUTRAL ON THE BILL AND ALSO WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION OF THE AUTHORS OFFICE NO ONE ELSE THE TO WORK SO HARD TO TRY. TO GET THE LANGUAGE RIGHT WERE EVERYONE NEEDS THAT DOES SEEM LIKE IT'S GETTING PRETTY CLOSE -- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK PROTECTION LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THERE AND THINK THAT MAKES IT A MUCH STRONGER BILL -- ART TO REMAINING CONCERNS HAVE TO DO WITH WORKER PRIVACY -- THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE DOES ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WORKERS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA PARTICULARLY FINANCIAL DATA. ALSO GEOLOCATION DATA THINGS LIKE THAT FROM BEING SOLD OFF TO THIRD PARTIES BUT WE'RE KIND OF NEW TO THIS ARIENS ARE STILL REVIEWING THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE INTENT IS ACHIEVED BY THE WAY THAT IT'S WRITTEN BUT THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW AND THEN THE OTHER CONCERN WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT HELPS PROTECT. A WORKERS. EXPOSURE TO THE SERVICE AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES THEY'VE ACCESS THE SERVICE FROM BEING TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE EMPLOYER TO THE EXTENT THAT'S POSSIBLE THE SAME WAY THAT -- SOMEONE WOULD WANT THEIR PLAYER TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A PAYDAY LOAN SERVICE THAT THIS IS KIND OF A OF A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE SAME THING BUT ARE THERE A LOT OF REASONS WHY WORKER WOULD NOT WANT THEIR EMPLOYER TO KNOW ABOUT THAT SO IF. THERE'S WAYS TO KEEP THAT INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT OVERALL WE DO SEE THIS AS A MUCH LESS RISKY MUCH MORE. RESPONSIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO PAY LATE PAYDAY LENDING AND DO THINK IT'S AN EXCITING NEW INDUSTRY SECTOR AND LOOK FOR DAYS STAYING INVOLVED IN THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. RIGHT SEEN AND I'M ACTUALLY GONNA ASK THE AUTHOR IF THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON ANY OF THIS BEFORE A TAKE MEMBER QUESTIONS JUST BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER. OF THE ISSUES RAISED AND PERHAPS I THINK SOME OF THEM MA'AM MAY ALSO BE ADDRESSED AND SENATE YOU DISH. OKAY THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR SO -- PART OF THAT THE CHALLENGE WITH -- SO SO LET ME JUST START OFF BY SAYING THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT WERE HERE IN THIS POSITION IS THAT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT THERE THERE SHOULD BE -- SOME OVERSIGHT OF THIS KIND OF LENDING BECAUSE IT IS NOW ON THE INTERNET AND AND THERE ARE NO PROTECTIONS AND SO ON THE REASON THAT WE WAITED IN WADE. WAITED. INTO IT -- WAS BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW MADAM CHAIR I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE AS MANY OUTLETS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET. THEIR CASH WHEN THEY NEED IT -- LEGITIMATELY -- AND AND THIS JUST SEEM TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE -- YOU EARN YOUR YOU EARN A CHECK AND THEN YOU GET IT AT THE END OF A PAY PERIOD BUT IN THE MEANTIME. YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS -- TO THAT MONEY AND SO ON THAT'S REALLY THE GENESIS OF OF DOING THIS WORK SO PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS -- THE THE THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS DISCUSSION SO THEY'VE HELPED US -- TO PUT OUR ARMS AROUND WHAT IS RIGHT NOW -- THE WILD WEST WITH ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS DOING WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO -- AND AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER FRAMEWORK FOR SETTING UP. THAT THAT WHAT YOU GET CHARGED IT DOESN'T END UP BEING LIKE A PAYDAY LOAN ONLY IT'S IT'S HIDDEN SOMEWHERE RIGHT. AND SO -- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A CAP ON THAT IT THAT IS CERTAIN AND INCLUDE ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD CHARGE -- IN ORDER TO ACCESS YOUR MONEY -- IF THE COMPANY. REQUIRES IF THE COMPANY HAS AN EXPEDITION -- AN EXPEDITIOUS BACK CASH -- SYSTEM THEN AB AND THEY CHARGE YOU MORE FOR THAT IT CAN'T IT THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE CHARGING YOU CAN BE MORE THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS SO THERE'S SOME OF THEM CHARGE -- IF YOU WANT IT SAME DAY OR THE NEXT DAY -- A A SPECIAL FEE FOR THAT SO SO THAT'S WHERE THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS COMES FROM FRANKLY -- WE THAT THE 50% -- IS IS THE REASON THAT'S A PART OF THAT THE PLAN IS BECAUSE AT LEAST INITIALLY WE WANT TO SEE HOW HOW THIS WORKS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. DON'T GET TO THE END OF THEIR PAY PER PAY PERIOD AND THEN HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO MONEY AND AND FIND THAT THEN THEY END UP. WITH THE PAYDAY LENDER ANYWAY -- AND SO THAT THE GUARD RAILS THAT WERE SPOKEN OF THOSE WERE WERE CRAFTED WITHOUT TAKING AS MUCH INPUT FROM THE INDUSTRY AND THEN SITTING DOWN WITH THE CONSUMER GROUPS AS WELL. THE CONSUMER AND LABOR TO MAKE SURE THAT ON THAT -- THAT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT MAKES MAKES SENSE SO -- THERE WAS A THERE WAS A MENTION. OF A AND I'M LOOKING AT MY NOTES AND I DON'T SEE IT BUT AT LEAST ONE OF THE COMPANIES -- DOESN'T CHARGE A FEE. BUT YOU CAN PAY. AS YOU CAN PAY A TIP AND YOU CAN PAY NOTHING OR YOU CAN PAY -- A LOT OF MONEY AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT. IS IS THAT IT IT'S PART OF A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST RIGHT THAT DOES THAT ARE USING THAT SERVICE PAY FOR EACH OTHER AND HELP EACH OTHER OUT -- AND THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS IS PHAM I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEIR HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY THEN RIGHT I MEAN AND AND IN THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD WITH. WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS IS-IS THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE SELLING THE INFORMATION OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE PAYING. FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO YOUR YOUR MONEY AND IT DOESN'T COST YOU ANYTHING -- IT THERE THERE THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM DEPENDS ON A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST AND AND AND THAT JUST SEEMED HARD TO REGULATE. AND HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE GETTING FROM THE CUSTOMERS AND BOB TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ALSO HAVE ACCESS EMAIL AXIS -- HOW MANY TIMES THEY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH YOU AND START BUGGING YOU ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T TAP AND NOW WE WANT SOME MONEY AND HOW DO YOU EXPECT IT WILL THAT WE WERE JUST UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT SO? SO -- SOME OF THE DETAILS IN TERMS OF HOW IT'S BEEN STRUCTURED IS TAKING EVERYBODY'S MODEL INTO CONSIDERATION IN TRYING TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT D. B. O. IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE AND THAT. THAT -- ALSO HAS SOME PROTECTED PROTECTIONS OF THE WORKERS AS WELL AND THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT FORMS OF COMMITTEE OF COMMUNICATION ONE IS DIRECTLY WHERE SOMEONE GETS ON THE INTERNET THE OTHER ONE IS THROUGH THE EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYER CAN OFFER THIS AS A SERVICE. TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEN -- AND THEN THEY SET UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THEIR THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYMENT -- RELATIONSHIP AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE PROTECTED AS PART PART OF THAT BECAUSE IT IT IS A IT IS. A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR SOMETHING THEIR EMPLOYER IS OFFERING IT AS PART OF PART OF THEIR SYSTEM. AND THEN THEY DO IT THROUGH THEIR THEIR PAYROLL SYSTEM AS WELL SO -- SO THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT MODELS AND WE WE'VE TRIED TO TREAT THEM BOTH THE SAME AND AND GIVE THEM THE SAME KIND OF FLEXIBILITY. SO I AM PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU AND I DO WANT TO JUST OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO THERE WAS A REFERENCE MADE SPECIFICALLY. TO THE TIP MODEL AND SO I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO BRIEFLY ANSWER THAT BECAUSE THEY DO WANT TO GET TO MEMBERS COMMENTS QUESTIONS. YOUR COMPANY OPERATES ON A COMPLETELY TO BASE MODEL WE DON'T CHARGE ME FEES IN ADDITION TO TIPS THERE'S ONE OTHER COMPANY THAT DOES TIPS AS WELL AS FEES -- IS THE FIRST OF WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION IN FACT WE'VE TURNED DOWN COMPLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH A PROCESS TO PICTURE INFORMATION WE REFUSE TO GET INTO THOSE. SO WE DO NOT SHARE INFORMATION WITH ANYBODY -- MUSIC FOR THE PRODUCT. THE WAVE OF AND WE THINK OF THE SERVICE OF A WE'RE ON TAPES NOT JUST FOR ACCESS TO WAGES BUT ALSO FOR OUR HEALTH CARE PRODUCT. WE NEGOTIATE DOWN MEDICAL BILLS AND WE DON'T CHARGEFOR IT WE TELL PEOPLE TO PASS WHATEVER THEY THINK IS FAIR. BOTH THE SERVICES WHETHER IT'S ACCESS YOUR OWN PAGE OR ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE HELD BACK FROM SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE TO PAY A FEE. SO IF SOMEBODY'S ON ABLE TO AFFORD IT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICE. IF THEY ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT THEN THEY CAN PAY US WHAT THEY THINK IS FAIR. AND IF THERE'S A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN HELP OUT OTHER PEOPLE WE ACTUALLY WANT WE LIKE THAT THAT PEOPLE HELP OTHER PEOPLE -- TO ME I THINK IT'S WE TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM IS THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY LIKE COME UP AND THAT THE RESPONSE RELEASE COMPLETELY UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL. REALTY THAT IS NOT COMPLETELY UP THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE TO COME UP LIKE WE SHOULD PERMIT TO THE SOCIETY WERE -- COMMITTEE WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HELP EACH OTHER OUT. IT'S SO I KNOW THAT IT'S A NEW MODEL PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE -- BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S NEW AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE. I THINK CHAU ACTUALLY WANT PEOPLE TO HELP PEOPLE -- IT'S A THAT'S HOW WE STRUCTURE THIS WHERE IF YOU WANT HELP SOMEONE WE TELL YOU THAT IS GOING HELP SOMEBODY ELSE. AND THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL ACTUALLY SEND YOU A THANK YOU MESSAGE -- INTO REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE HELPING EACH OTHER OUT. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- FROM THE MEMBERS. A SAM ROBERT CAN -- SO I WANT TO START BY THINKING OFFER I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT PROJECTIONS IN HERE AS WELL -- AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED EVERY TURN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR EARNINGS -- I HEARD ALL OF YOU SAY ON EVERY BETWEEN NURSE OF GIVING UP THE SHINS THE TRAINERS AND THE SUPPORT THAT WERE THIS IS A SAFE INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION AND THEN AND WE WANT TO PROTECT IT -- AND ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS REALLY THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS AND NONE OF YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE AMENDMENT THAT RELATES TO THE THREE ADVANCES PER WEEK AS WELL WHICH IS ANOTHER REGULATION THAT I THINK IS BEING ADDED TO THIS -- IS THAT THIS PUTS REGULATIONS IN GUARDRAILS IN PLACE THAT ARE NOT PUT INTO PLACE ON OUR PAYDAY LOANS AND OUR OTHER I WOULD SAY MORE PROBLEMATIC PRODUCTS. AND SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT. I'M SOMEBODY WHO MY RENT COMES DO I NEED TO PAY MY RANTS MY RENT IS MORE THAN 50% OF MY EARNED INCOME I CAN ONLY GET MY LOAN. AND THAT I WOULD ACTUALLY RATHER OUR CONSTITUENTS BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO EARNED INCOME IN A SAFE AND INEXPENSIVE WAY AND SO I GUESS I'M CONFUSED WHY WOULD PUT THESE GUARDRAILS UP IN THIS SITUATION WHEN WE'RE NOT PUTTING THEM UP. ON WATER ARGUABLY MORE PROBLEMATIC PRODUCTS BECAUSE THAT MIGHT. MAKE A GUESS I SEE WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING IT MIGHT TURN PEOPLE TO MORE PROBLEMATIC -- PRODUCTS AND I SEE THAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE 50% IN THE THREE THE CAP ON THE THREE ADVANCES PER WEEK ON THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T DO IN THESE OTHER SOLUTIONS TO HAVE THOUGHTS ON THEM. YEAH I'M NOT HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR PAYDAY LOANS. HONESTLY -- THEIR THEIR PROBLEMATIC AND AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE PROBLEMATIC -- I GUESS THE THAT THE ONLY ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS IN TERMS OF A CAP AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN ACCESS AND HOW MUCH MONEY YOU CAN TAKE OUT. IS BECAUSE THERE -- THERE ARE -- ADVOCATES THAT BELIEVE THAT -- WELL. THERE WERE EVEN MORE. MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS THAT WE JUST DIDN'T WANT IT TAKE BECAUSE WE WANT THIS THIS IS AN EMERGING OPPORTUNITY AND WE WANT IT TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AND AS USER FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE. SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS TO FIGURE IT WITHOUT BEING. PATRONIZING ABOUT THE WHOLE THING -- IS TO SET SOME -- SOME GUARD RAILS UP SO PEOPLE CAN USE IT AND WE WE COME BACK AND WE TAKE A LOOK AT HOW IT'S BEEN WORKING. AT FOR THAT FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT -- WE DON'T WANT TO CONTROL HOW PEOPLE ARE USING IT RIGHT MAY USE THE EXAMPLE OF THE RENT -- BUT IT IT'S THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE USED. FOR THAT ARE THAT KIND OF THE NECESSITIES THAT POP UP WHICH IS FOOD GAS EVERYTHING THAT THAT YOU HEARD -- THAT -- IN THE END PEOPLE. IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY MANAGEMENT AND AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS THAT. IS THAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT IF IF YOUR CHECK ISN'T ENOUGH AT THE END OF THE DAY TO COVER ANY EMERGENCIES THEN IT'S NOT GONNA BE IT ENOUGH AT THE END EITHER AND SO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATEAN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SOME CASH TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS? THAT WILL. COST THEM A LOT OF MONEY IF THEY DON'T PAY. BECAUSE OF THE LATE FEES BECAUSE OF OF PENALTIES -- BUT ALSO LEAVE THEM WITH WITH THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY HAVE THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE MONTH SO -- I MEAN YOU RAISE A GOOD QUESTION. BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS TO WORK WITH THE CONSUMER GROUPS AS WELL THAT SAY WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT PEOPLE AREN'T AREN'T TAKING OUT ALL THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET BY THE END OF THE END OF THE MONTH AND THEN THEY'RE AT THEIR AT A PAYDAY LENDER BECAUSE THEY GOT A WHOLE MONTH NOW OR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS THAT THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE -- TO AND PAY THINGS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR THEIR LIFESTYLEOR TO BE ABLE. TO FEED THE KIDS OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY'RE DOING SO -- I DON'T HAVE THE PERFECT ANSWER FOR THAT EITHER THEN IT'S IT'S PART OF WHAT'S BEEN NEGOTIATED OVER A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS YEAH AND I GUESS IT COMES ON A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE CONTROLLING. ACCESS TO THAT CAPITAL OR NO THAT'S EXACTLY REGS. WHICH WE CAN ALL PROBABLY COME TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS ON I DO HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION WHICH IS PACKED OF IS THE SPONSOR AYE. IT'S MY UNDERSTAND HAS GIVEN IS A FOR PROFIT COMPANY RIGHT CORRECT I'M IN THIS READS TO ME FROM THE ANALYSIS LIKE WORK HARD TO FIND YOUR BUSINESS MODEL INTO LAW WHICH GIVES ME A LITTLE DISCOMFORT CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. I THINK I CAN I CAN ANSWER THAT AND THEN CENTER IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT BECAUSE THIS WAS THE ISN'T LAST HEARINGS AS WELL -- WE DID TAKE THE STEP TO SPONSOR THE BILL -- AS A MATTER OF FACT. OUR APPROACH AND WERE UP. PRODUCTS DO NOT EVEN RELATE TO OR ONE OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN RELATE TO WHAT IS IN THE BILL WHICH IS THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER SOLUTION WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT -- AS A COMPANY -- AS FAR AS THE THE INCOME AXIS IS CONCERNED -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY OF ACCESS IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCESS. VIA GIVING. SELF IMPOSED RESTRICTION WITH A GUARD RAILS 50% OF NET INCOME. THE BILL TALKS ABOUT 50% OF GROSS INCOME WHICH IS ALMOST 70% OF NET INCOME. SOUL BE CHARGE A FIVE DOLLAR FEE FOR THREE AXIS IS NOW IN OUR BUSINESS MODEL. THE BILL TALKS ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN A MONTH SO THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN A PRETTY ROBUST. AND OF VERY PARTICIPATING PROCESS WE DID INITIATE AND START THE PROCESS BUT TO CLASSIFY IT AND SAID THAT YOU KNOW -- BUT SOME STAKEHOLDERS THAT IT IS A ONE COMPANY BILL AT THINK IT DOES A DISSERVICE TO ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE. ON THIS BILL FOR MONTHS AT THIS POINT OF VIEW WE HAVE DONE NOTHING EXCEPT SUPPORT THE BILL AND AND THE SENATOR HAS BEEN WHILE WORKING. DILIGENTLY WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND TAKING THEIR INPUT -- IN THE BILL. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. LET ME AMPLIFY ON THIS POINT HERE -- ACTUALLY THAT'S ONLY BY WAY OF THE SORRY -- I I THOUGHT THE QUESTION WAS ON THE 50% SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT THE DEATH CHANCE TO SCRAP. IT WITH THE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE WINNERS ON THIS CHORE. SORRY ABOUT THAT. YEAH. ADDRESS THE POINT. I JUST WANNA AMPLIFY I THINK PROBABLY WHAT THE SENATORS ARE HE SAID -- IN THAT CONTEXT. SO YEAH WE DO A VERY STRONG VIEW ON THIS AS YOU CAN TELL. THAT -- THAT THE CONSUMER AND THE WORKER WILL BE HARMED. IF THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THEIR MONEY NOW WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN AT THIS BUSINESS FOR FOUR YEARS. AND WE'VE SEEN EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT GO THROW AS I SAID BEFORE NEVER ONCE HAVE I HAD A SINGLE PERSON. ACROSS ALL OF THE USERS INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA EVER RECEIVE NOTHING ON PAYDAY. SO HERE I JUST OR TICKET WHAT ARE ISSUE IS. WE DO BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT THAT FULL ACCESS PEOPLE WILL GO TO SUB OPTIMAL OR INFERIOR. OTHER SOURCES OF CAPITAL BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE UTILITY BILL OR THE RENT IT HAS TO GET PAID. BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PAYING THAT ARE DIRE. IN SO. THE ABILITY TO ACCESS ALL OF YOUR INCOME WHEN YOU WANT. WE BELIEVE ALLEVIATE THAT PRESSURE. I THINK THERE IS THAT. SORT OF AN UNDER TO A A SUBTEXT HERE AS WELL -- UNITE I FOLLOWED. EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY NINE AND IF THIS BILL. REALLY DID PUT A DENT IN THE PAYDAY LENDING INDUSTRY. I'M GUESSING WE WHAT HURTS MY POSITION FROM THAT. WE'VE NOT HEARD ANY OPPOSITION BECAUSE THE REALITY IS IF PEOPLE ARE LIMITED TO ONLY HALF OF THEIR INCOME. THEY WILL STILL. GO TO A PAYDAY LENDER BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY AVAILABLE SOURCE OF CAPITAL FOR SOMEONE WHO JUST IS IN THAT DESPERATE OF THE SITUATION. I TAKE VERY MUCH THIS ANALYSIS THAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO WIND UP AT THE END OF THE PAY PERIOD WITHOUT ANYTHING. WHICH IS WHY WOULD I THINK A AN ELEGANT SOLUTION WOULD BE GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS. AND IF THEY ARE IN THAT POSITION REPEATEDLY. TWICE EVERY SIX MONTHS. THAT THEY WERE THEN BE A RATCHET BACK 250% OF THE EARNED INCOME AMOUNT. OUR AND I'M GOING TO WRAP IT UP AND WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS TOO SO YEAH I KNOW THANK YOU AND I THINK ONE OF I JUST YOU KNOW. I GUESS MY CONCERN AND WE HAVE A QUESTION ON THE CHAIRS BILL WHICH WAS FIVE THIRTY NINE I THINK YEAH -- ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT AS WE DECREASE THE ACCESS. TO BAD PRODUCTS WHICH WE I SUPPORTED I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT WHICH IS IMPORTANT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ON BANKS HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE PARTIES HERE IS DOING THAT IN A SAFE WAY BUT ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. EVEN AFTER AND BANKED IN THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE SOLUTION SO I THINK YOU FROM BEING IN THE SPACE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO A CONCLUSION. THANK YOU AND I THINK. AS A MEMBER GRAYSON YES. THANK YOU CHAIR -- I I WANNA THINK -- THE SENATOR FOR YOUR GOOD WORK ON THIS. I THINK IT'S JUST ONE OF THE ANSWERS THAT WE CAN LOOK FOR FOR ACCESS TO CAPITAL. ESPECIALLY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHERE IT'S NOT ALONE IT'S ACTUALLY -- TAPPING INTO EARNED INCOME. AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT IF I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY THIS IS NOT THE END OF CONVERSATION FOR THE BILL. THERE'S GOING TO BE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS BILL TO BE WORKED ON AND FOR CONVERSATIONS TO TAKE PLACE -- TO HELP IMPROVE THE BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD IN THE PROCESS -- ALSO I WOULD JUST LIKE -- TO MAYBE FIND OUT NOT TODAY IN HERE BUT IT'S QUITE INTERESTING THAT THE BOLD STATEMENTS BEING MADE MULTIPLE TIMES THAT A NOT ONE TIME IS SOMEONE. ENDED UP ON PAYDAY WITH NOTHING IN THERE -- IN THEIR PAYCHECK BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL OUT. A IS THERE MONITORING TAKING PLACE -- ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THIS PROGRAM. AS FAR AS YOUR MONITORING HOW MUCH THEY MAKE AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE PAYING OUT AND HOW THEY WERE -- ABLE -- TO HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO TELL WHEN SOMEONE HAS -- COME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE ZERO AMOUNT OF MONEY LEFT IN THEIR PAYCHECK SO -- WITH THAT I DON'T NEED AN ANSWER TODAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEEKS AND THEN WEBER. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR COMING AND THEY JUST -- ONE QUESTION THE FIFTEEN DOLLAR A MONTH -- CAP -- FOR SOME PEOPLE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY -- I AND I KNOW THE THE% NATIONAL CONSUMER LAW CENTER SENTINEL OTHER OF OPPOSITION AND OF THAT IT REACHED IN TIME BUT THEY HAD SUGGESTED FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH IS A CAB -- CAN YOU JUST TALK THROUGH HOW YOU COULD HAVE GOT TO THAT FIFTEEN DOLLAR MONTH HE IN JUST FOR A FOR A REAL LOW INCOME FOLKS IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN. REDUCE THAT FEED MORE. WELL YOU HEARD YOU HEARD TODAY THAT -- SOME OF THE PROVIDERS -- CHARGE A LOT LESS -- IT WAS NEGOTIATED FRANKLY -- WHEN WE WROTE THE BILL IT WAS -- FOURTEEN WE PICKED IT OUT OF THE AIR BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING FROM WHICH WE COULD WE COULD TALK -- AND IN THE END -- THAT THE MODELS WERE ALSO DIFFERENT THAT -- SET TO THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS HOW MANY TIMES CAN PEOPLE ACCESS -- MONEY FROM THEIR CHECK AND AND THE IDEA WAS TO ALLOW THEM. TO THE THE THE ISSUE WAS THEY CAN USE IT EVERY DAY IF THEY WANT TO WRITE THEY CAN TAKE OUT EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO IS KIND OF SET SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND IT SO THAT WE CAN GET SOME GOOD DATA ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE USING IT -- AND TO ANSWER. MR GRAYSON'S A QUESTION IS THAT THERE IS NO MONITORING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM IT'S THE REASON THAT THIS BILL WAS PROPOSED -- AND AND SO NOT EVERYBODY WILL CHARGE FIFTEEN AND AND SOME CHARGE PER MONTH SOME CHARGEPER EVENTS AND BANDAIDS X. M.. EXTRACTION OF MONEY -- OUT OF THEIR CHECK AND SO WEAK IF WE BASICALLY AGREED THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS WAS -- WAS THE MAX THAT WE THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE SOME OF THE THE LENDER AT NIGHT IT'S NOT ALONE SOME OF THE COMPANIES. CHARGE YOU EXTRA IF YOU WANT THE MONEY [inaudible] EXPEDITED AND OTHERWISE IT THERE'S A TURN AROUND THAT THAT MAY BE A COUPLE OF DAYS AND SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CAPTURED. THAT CHARGES WILD SO IF YOU ADD EVERYTHING UP IT CAN'T BE MORE THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS SO IF YOU. IN DESPERATE NEED OF YOUR MONEY AS IN TODAY OR TOMORROW AND YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY THE EXTRA SEVEN DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS -- THEN TOWED AT THE TOTAL AMOUNT CAN'T BE MORE THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING I THINK MOST OF THEM CHARGE ME MUCH LESS THAN THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS -- IT BUT YOU MAY YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY EVERY TIME YOU TAKE MONEY OUT VERY SIMILAR TO LIKE. A LIKE AS IN IN AN ATM. OKAY THANK YOU. NUMBER WEBER. YES I DO WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I I CAN SEE THAT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND I ONE THINK I CHEER FOR THE HARD WORK AND DILIGENCE IN TRYING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN -- IN TERMS TO YOUR YOUR YOUR ORGANIZATION IS JUST STRICTLY FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES IS THAT CORRECT OR IS THIS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC IT WOULD STARTED I WAS DOING IT BY HAND. FOR MY EMPLOYEES AND THEN THEY TELL THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT IT SO I STARTED FOR THEIR FRIENDS AND I OPENED UP FOR EVERYBODY ELSE OKAY AND IS A LOCATED WHERE. WE ARE IN PALO ALTO OKAY I STARTED WHEN I WAS LIVING IN CINCINNATI OHIO WE DO IT TODAY FOR EMPLOYEES OR FIFTY THOUSAND COMPANIES. OKAY BUT IT BUT IT COMPANIES DO THAT IT'S IT'S WITHIN THEIR COMPANY IS THAT CORRECT. HIS SISTER NEW YOURS DIRECT HOW DOES WHAT IS CALLED DIRECT TO CONSUMER MANY COMPANIES PROMOTERS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES OKAY SO THEY WOULD TELL THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH POSTERS IN THE BREAK ROOM AND THINGS LIKE THAT OKAY SOUNDED. OKAY THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS I I PROBABLY I THINK I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE LONGER THAN ANYONE -- SITTING HERE AND THIS IS ALL BEEN AN ONGOING CHALLENGE AND A AN UNBELIEVABLE CHALLENGE WITH REGARDS TO PAYDAY LOANS AND ALL THE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS AND AS I LOOK AT THIS I REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT PERFECT IF IT WERE PERFECT -- PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE IT LONG TIME AGO. BUT ITREQUIRES OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF INPUT AND IT HAS THUS FAR IN TERMS OF ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE AND WE CAN PROBABLY PICK THIS THING TO DEATH. BETWEEN WHETHER IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS OR FIVE OR SEVEN EVERY OTHER WEEK. OR YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE TO GET 250% OF WHATEVER UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T WANT FIFTY BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU TAKE ALL YOUR MONEY OUT -- YOU'RE AT ZERO AND THEN YOU MIGHT NEED SOMEBODY THE NEXT WEEK YOU HAVEN'T EARNED ANY YET I MEAN YOU KNOW I CAN SEE ALL THESE THINGS OCCURRING. AND I KNOW WE TRY TO DO OUR BEST TO TRY TO PROTECT EVERYBODY WHICH WE KNOW WOULD NOT ABLE TO DO BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S GROWN OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS BUT THEY DON'T SELL WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. TOO SO WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT POSITION OF HAVING TO MANAGE OTHER PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR THE L. L. UP OUT OF SOME GOOD. THIS IN OUR OWN HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE JUST DEVASTATED BY THESE AGENCIES IN WITH A LACK OF RESOURCES AND NOT ABLE TO DO VERY MUCH SO. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE I THINK IT'S SO. OF A FANTASTIC JOB BASED ON WHAT I'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS ON THIS COMMITTEE. OF WRESTLING WITH THIS ISSUE AND HAVING COMING UP WITH VERY FEW SOLUTIONS THAT MAKE US FEEL ANY BETTER WHEN IT'S ALL OVER BECAUSE WE STILL ARE. SOMETIMES FEEDING THE MONSTER AND WE MAY BE FEEDING HIM AGAIN IN A SMALLER WAY. I THINK THE FACT THAT IT HAS A SUNSET OF THREE YEARS WILL GIVE US A CHANCE TO SEE IF THIS REALLY WORKS IF IT BEGINS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. AND THAT HAVING BEEN SAID I WANNA MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ANY OTHER ASSEMBLY ARE CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THE I HEAR. BOTH THE SIZE SO AND IN GENERAL THE CONCEPT THAT THING I UNDERSTAND THE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE. LEAVING -- ON PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK A BASS HE SAID AND THEN WHEN THEY NEED MONEY THEY HAVE TO GO TO A WHAT THE PAYDAY LENDER AND THE MORE FEES ETCETERA SO IN CONCEPT THE USING THEIR OWN MONEY. I IS -- A TRACTIVE -- BUT THEY DO HAVE OF A FEW QUESTIONS OF THAT MAY BE -- ALREADY MENTIONED ABOUT THE ARE THESE SOMETHING THAT THE WHY ARE WE TRYING -- TO INTRODUCE OF THROUGH OF BEER IF THIS IS SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE A PROGRAM -- THE COMPANIES. THE LOCK CODE MR LEAD THAT THEY YOU CAME TO BRIEF ME. AND YOU CAN NOW SELL YOUR PRODUCT TO COMPANIES AND THEN THEY CAN IMPLEMENT AS I'M NOT GONNA. A RECRUITMENT AND INCENTIVE FOR THE EMPLOYEES SAY. AND THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN BUY INTO YOUR PROGRAM AND TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE SO WHY STATE HAS TO COME IN. AND DAY. OUT. ALLOW MEANT IS THAT A MANDATE FOR THE COMPANY TO IF THE PAST IS. ONE FOR IF WHAT'S NOT. NO THIS IS NOT A MANDATE THIS IS THIS IS JUST THAT A WAY. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT THAT REGULATES ALL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS YEP TO HAVE US THEM. HI I SEE OKAY YEAH THE US OUT. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ONE WAS THAT THEY A SOFTWARE WILL BE SITTING ON TOP OF A COMPANY SO. APPARENT SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID RIGHT SO IS A VISIBLE AND ON HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE EARNED UP TO DIS MORE MOMENT. AND A 50% OR BEAT NET INCOME WOULD BE HOW MUCH SO THE PROGRAM ORDER. OUR SELF MONEY TO CELLPHONE WHY A GOVERNMENT AGENCY IS A NEEDED OVERSIGHT THIS CONTROL THIS COMBO -- TRANSACTIONS SO SO THAT'S MY QUESTION AND BECAUSE IT DOESN'T AND OF THE GOVERNMENT THE ENTITY THAT WOULD COSTA IN ALL MONITORING -- ETCETERA AND THE THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS -- VIOLATION -- FOR CIVIL PENALTY THE FORTY I A A PROVIDE IS A WORKABLE SITUATION. THAT WOULD BE I'M I'M CURIOUS -- AND I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME ALTHOUGH -- STATE SAID THAT HAVE BEEN LEGISLATED ON THIS ONE IN A WILL COME A EXPERIENCE. WITH THE OVERSIGHT WAS THE NEEDED. OUR OR OUR THIS UP -- OUR NICELY CHEN NEED TO BE INVOLVED. WHY ARE WE TRYING TO LEGISLATE THAT THIS KIND OF A? VERY ATTRACTIVE OPENED UP -- PRODUCT. AT THE FOR THE EMPLOYEES. AND THE MY FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE. I KNOW THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE FINANCIAL -- IT. THE MANAGEMENT OF THE OWN MONEY IN THIS IS OUR LIKE -- ALLOWING THE EMPLOYEES SO TO ADVANCE. IN OTHER WORDS SOME MONEY THEY HAVE EARNED A AND THAT NOW USE IT. BEFORE THE PAYDAY. AND BY DOING SO THIS ONE IS A TRYING. TO PROVIDE A CAR FOR ACCESSING ONE A 50%. I SAW THAT THERE BE SOME MONEY LEFT OVER THE PAYDAY SO. HOWEVER [inaudible] THIS ORDER. PERPETUATE THE THEO FINANCIAL. IN ALL BAD THE MANAGEMENT. SO ARE -- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WILL SOLVE THAT THE PROBLEM. ANYBODY CAN ANSWER SO DOCTOR TRY LET ME LET ME BE THE LET ME ANSWER THIS REALLY BRIEFLY BECAUSE I CAN SEE THAT -- WE'RE GONNA LOSE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT AT THE IT IS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGULATES ALL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND THEY DO IT IN A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PERSON IS IS LICENSED. THE TO DOING THAT TRANSACTION THAT THEY ARE LIVING UP TO THE HIGHEST. STANDARDS WHICH ARE ETHICAL AND AND AND AND LEGAL OBLIGATION THAT THE STATE'S PUT ON IT THIS IS THIS IS A NEW PRODUCT THAT HAS COME OUT THAT HERE TOO FOR HAS NOT BEEN PART OF THE OF THAT. UP REGULATORY OVERSIGHT SO -- SO THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT WAS CONCERNED THERE THE REGULATORY AGENCY THAT OB THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THIS SPACE AND SO THEY HAD. A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS AND SAID WE REALLY THINK THAT IT'S BEST IF YOU'RE REGULATED BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN DO REPORTING TO US AND WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PRODUCT. IS -- LIVING UP TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS POSSIBLE AND SO THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION IS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT -- HOW THE MODELS OPERATE AND HOW THEY AND AND WHETHER CONSUMERS ARE GETTING GOOD VALUE FOR THEIR MONEY AND WHETHER IT WORKS WELL AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS PRODUCTS THAT ARE HERE AND THAT'S THE REASON THE? BILL IS BEFORE YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. YEAH I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY OTHER FEEDBACK ON MY NUMBER BY ANY OF THE OTHER STATES -- THAT HAVE -- ALREADY THIS KIND OF WELL. PRODUCT THOUGH INTRODUCED ON AND THEN HOW WE STILL WORKING. AND THEN ALSO -- FIFTEEN DOLLARS HAS BEEN DEBATED WHETHER THAT'S A GOOD FOR YOU ARE NOT. BUT WHY -- AM I SUPPOSED TO PAY FIFTEEN DOLLARS EVERY MONTH. RATHER THAN WHEN I ACCESS TO MY IN ALL EARNED INCOME THEN MAYBE YOU CAN TIED ME 1% OR WHATEVER. AT THAT TIME FIXED AMOUNT THE FORD FENCING SUCH A HANDLING FEE. BUT SOMETIMES I MEAN I NEED -- BUT TO ADVANCE SET AND ONCE I AND ROLLED I HAVE. TO PAY YOU IN A FIFTEEN DOLLARS EVERY MONTH ACCORDING TO THIS BILL. SAID THAT THE SONG IF WE CAN JUST BRIEFLY ANSWER I THINK THE HEARING FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI AS ARE THERE OTHER STATES. ON THAT REGULATE THIS PRODUCT pAND IF SO ARE THEY SIMILAR NOT BRIEFLY UGH TO THE JOBS ARE AT PRESENT IS NO THE STATE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT IS WORKING ACTIVELY ON LEGISLATION. FOR OWN INCOME ACCESS SO CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THE FIRST STATE. ARE THE FIFTEEN DOLLAR IS AN OPTION YOU KNOW IT'S A ONE TO PROGRAM SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PARTICIPATE. AND THE FIFTEEN DOLLAR IS A NONRECURRING FEE AND IT IS UP TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS IT IS NOT A COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL BE CHARGED FIFTEEN DOLLARS THAT'S THE MAXIMUM. SO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE THE OPTION TO CHARGE LESS BUT THEY CANNOT CHARGE MORE THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS ON A NON RECURRING BASIS. OKAY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS. OKAY SEE NO I DIDN'T. SAY NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I'M AS IT'S BEEN STATED I THINK REPEATEDLY. THIS THERE ARE THREE COMMITTEES -- AND THE AUTHORS OFFICE WORKING ON NOW. THIS PARTICULAR THERE'S BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL I JUST AS A REMINDER THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS -- BETWEEN PAGES SEVEN AND NINE OF THE ANALYSIS THAT HAVE THAT ARE BEING TAKEN THAT -- THERE THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO TAKE THESE COMMITTEES AND YOU DISH. AND I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY DO DISH -- MAY ALSO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND AMENDMENTS -- THERE THAT ARE PERTINENT TO THAT COMMITTEE BUT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED. I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE GENERATED. A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR OF CONSIDERATIONS FOR ALL OF US. TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WE WHEN DISCUSSING THIS PARTICULAR BILL BUT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT IN THIS CONVERSATION THERE SEEM TO BE SOME. AGREEMENT THAT. THERE ARE BAD PRODUCTS THAT HURT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT THIS IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THOSE BAD PRODUCTS AND SO I I JUST IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE ARGUE THAT IN THIS COMMITTEE ON ANY SIDE OF THIS ISSUE -- AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS COULD BE GOING THIS IS INDEED A NEW PRODUCT AND NEW. CAR CONCEPT OF HOW WE GIVE FOLKS ACCESS TO CAPITAL -- BUT IT HAS A NUMBER OF GUARD RAILS IN IT THAT DIDN'T EXIST SO WHEN IT CAME. TO ME ONE OF THE THINGS I THOUGHT ABOUT IS. THIS PRODUCT IS A NAY EXIST INDEPENDENT OF THIS BILL DO WE WANT A PRODUCT TO EXIST WITH GUARD RAILS OR COMPLETELY WITH OUR CARD BILLS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT THE ABILITY I'M NOT JUST FOR THE D. B. O. TO REGULATE BUT ALSO TO COLLECT. DATA AND INFORMATION THAT I THIS BILL SUNSETS IN IN THREE YEARS MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHETHER THEY'RE ON BANKING OR THERE AND MEMBERS OF THIS THAT OF THE LEGISLATURE WILL LIKELY. BE AROUND TO HAVE A CONVERSATION HOPEFULLY BE AROUND TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS IF IT WORKS IF IT DOESN'T WORK -- EIGHT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS THIS PRODUCT TO BECOME. ONE OF THE THE THE PRODUCTS THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED HERE -- AND NOT A NUMBER OF YEARS DOWN THE LINE WHERE WE REFLECT AND SAY WE SHOULD HAVE PUT GUARD RAILS AND SOONER WE SHOULD HAVE NOT ALLOWED THOSE AT GUARD RAILS AT TWO A B. LIMITED WE SHOULD BE REVISITING AND I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT THE BILL DOES -- AND I I THINK THAT IN IN TERMS OF THE PRIVACY CONCERNS I DO WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT'S COME UP A NUMBER OF TIME BUT THAT IS AN AMENDMENT THAT'S BEING TAKEN -- ADDITIONALLY AMONGST THE THE MANY AT AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN -- WE DO I DO HAVE A AN IRAQ -- ASK FOR THIS BILL AND WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT AND THANK ALL OF THE OFFICES THE AUTHOR AND ALL THE OFFICES WHO'VE BEEN INVOLVED. IN THIS PARTICULAR -- CONVERSATION AS YOU'VE NOTED. IT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND DURING THE WEEKS LOTS OF STUFF HAPPENING TRYING TO GET THIS AT TO A PLACE WHERE WE DID MORE THAN WHERE WE STARTED AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES THAT. SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND ARE COMING AT ALL ALL ALL EXCEPT YOU'RE YOU'RE WRAPPING UP AS MY CLOTHES AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS ROBUST TEARING AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.
