GO. ALL RIGHT GOOD MORNING FOLKS RODRIGUEZ CHAIRED SEMI COMMITTEE ON MIRCHI MANAGEMENT TODAY'S TOPIC HEARING IS ON AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS. ONCE AGAIN THANK AND WELCOME. PUSHIN OFFLOAD DELAYS AND THE IMPACT ON MERGER SPOTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS YOU ALL KNOW FIRST RESPONDERS AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE PERSONNEL HAVE FACED A MARATHON WE NEED CHALLENGES DURING THIS PANDEMIC. OUR EMS CREWS HAVE OFTEN WORK IN ENCLOSED SPACES WHILE TRANSPORTING PATIENTS HAVE BEEN PUTTING THEMSELVES IN SIGNIFICANT REST FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS NOW. AND THE NURSES PHYSICIANS IN OUR MUNCIE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH PATIENTS INFECTED WITH COVE IN NINETEEN. ON A DAILY BASIS WE CAN OUR EMTS FIREFIGHTERS PARAMEDICS NURSES AND DOCTORS TO MAKE. QUICK LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS UNDER THE MOST STRESSFUL WORKING CONDITIONS. IT'S NO SECRET THAT ARGUMENT SYSTEM HAS BEEN STRETCHED BEYOND THEIR CAPACITIES CAPABILITIES. THE RECENT CERTAIN COVER NINETEEN CASE TO DO THE ON THE GROUND VIRANT IS ONLY MAKING MATTERS WORSE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING PATIENT CARE AND TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS AND FINDS OF THIS PANDEMIC. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THAT I'VE SERVED OVER THIRTY YEARS OF THE FIRST RESPONDER. BUT AT TIMES WHEN I WAS WORKING AS AN EMT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THE SYSTEM FOR THE POLICY MAKERS HAVE MY BACK. FOR INSTANCE I RECALL WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHIFT WHERE I WAITED FOR OVER TWELVE HOURS AT A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO TRANSFER MY PATIENT. AND ANYONE HAVE BEEN PART OF IT YOU'RE MY SYSTEM KNOWS THAT WALK TIMES ISN'T A NEW ISSUE. THIS PROBLEM HAS BORN GOT BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING TO CONTINUOUSLY SEE THE REPORTS OF LONG WALL TIMES. IN THE PAPER'S MY FEEL FOR THE PATIENT THE CREWS AND THE MERGING PARTIES STAFF. LET ME BE CLEAR EXTENT OF ALL TIMES ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE PATIENT. THEY ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE AMBULANCE CREWS THE FIREFIGHTERS AND MEDICS WHAT TIMES. ARE CERTAINLY NOT GOOD FOR SOMEONE MAKING AN URGENT CALL TO NINE ONE ONE. FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE WHEN THERE ISN'T AN AMBULANCE AVAILABLE TO DISPATCH. WE NEED TO DO BETTER. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS A TO POINT FINGERS. WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN ASSUMING BLAME TO ANYONE THAT'S BEEN WORKING NONSTOP. TO SAVE LARGE FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. BUT WE WANT BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES TODAY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR. A SOLUTION BASED DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON HOW WE CAN ENHANCE PATIENT CARE. DO A BETTER JOB OF TAKING CARE OF THOSE WHO ARE SICK AND INJURED. AND WE SHOULD ALSO BE OPEN TO DISCUSSING ANY UNDERLYING ISSUES HINDERING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR EMS SYSTEM. IF WHAT TIMES ARE SYMPTOM OF A LARGER ISSUES SUCH AS WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. STRESSFUL AND CHALLENGING WORKING CONDITIONS. DECREASED INPATIENT CAPACITY OR HOW DID THE LAWS OR REGULATIONS WE SHOULD BE OPEN TO CHANGE. WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT CALIFORNIA IS A DISASTER PRONE STATE. AND WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED BY THE PROSPECT OF RESPONDING TO A MAJOR FIRE IN A KENTUCKY. EARTHQUAKE AT THE SAME TIME. WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR FUTURE SURGES IN DEMAND FOR MARCH MEDICAL SERVICES AND PLAN ACCORDINGLY. I LOOK FOR TO THE SHARING WITH YOUR IDEAS AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. TO CONTINUE TO CARE FOR THE SICK AND INJURED. WITHOUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY BACK VICE CHAIR KELLY SORRY ALSO FOR OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU THAT HAVE. ATTENDED IN PERSON HERE AND ALSO THOSE THAT. ARE REMOTE- I AM NO STRANGER TO THIS. I WAS- IN THE FIRE SERVICE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. MY OLD STOMPING GROUNDS DR KAZON IS NOW- NOW THEY ARE IN CHARGE OF THE MS- THERE AT L. A. COUNTY FIRE. BUT IN MY EARLY YEARS AS ALSO WITH INGLEWOOD FIRE DEPARTMENT AS A MEDIC. THE FAMILIAR WITH THE INCEPTION OF THIS- WHEN WAIT TIMES WHEN THEY HOSPITAL STARTED BECOMING. OVERRUN THE E. OURS AND- A LOT OF IS OVER USE. AND IN. A LOT OF LIABILITY CONCERNS BY EVERYBODY TRYING TO SHIFT LIABILITY. WHICH MEANT EVERYBODY WENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND- SO NOW HERE WE ARE TODAY THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN EXACERBATED. BY THE PANDEMIC CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE. AND SO IT'S- IT'S HIGH TIME THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS AND OUR GOAL HERE TODAY. IS TO ENSURE- THAT WE HAVE A SOME OPTIONS BECAUSE IN THE LEGISLATURE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE HELPFUL. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO BE HELPFUL WE WIND UP NOT BEING SO. AND AND SO IT'S-IMPORTANT FOR US TO HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT. OUT THERE TODAY IN THE DISH. TODAY HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN TO BE MORE HELPFUL IN- IN IN FIXING THIS SOLUTION- EMS IN THE PRE HOSPITAL SETTING WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE- THE OPTIMAL MEDICAL CARE IT WAS AN EARLY INTERVENTION. AND AS WE EXTEND THAT EARLY INTERVENTION TIME. THAT MEANS THE INTERVENTION THE THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET AT THE HOSPITAL- BECOMES REDUCED AND THAT'S NOT AN OPTIMAL CARE- TYPE OF A PROGRAM. SO ANYWAY WITH THAT. I WOULD TURN IT OVER BACK OVER TO THE CHAIR. AND AND THEN WE CAN HEAR FROM SOME OF OUR EXPERTS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE AND HOW WE CAN HELP SO THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU CAN OF ICE CHAIR SO WITH THAT LET'S GET STARTED WITH OUR FIRST PANEL. DO THE NUMBER OF WITNESSES ARE ASKED TO KEEP HER PRESENTATION TO NO MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES TO ALLOW TIME FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. WILL HOLD ALL QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER ALL THE WITNESSES OFFERED THEIR TESTIMONY. AND AT THE END OF THE SECOND PANEL WILL TAKE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PUBLIC COMMENTS. OUR FIRST WITNESS IS CHIEF RAY GUY. FROM THE CITY OF MONTR FAR DEPARTMENT. CHIEF GUY ALSO SERVES AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WITH THE CHIEF GUY. KALRA MORINGA. JUROR RIGAS CAN GUYS HEAR ME I'M JUST WANNA MAKE SURE MY AUDIO WORK IN. YES WE CAN HEAR. OKAY PERFECT. I LIKE TO THINK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. OF ALL TIME AND THE CRITICAL SYSTEM WIDE CRISIS AB ONE STATION AWFUL OF TIME THE PLACE. IS CAUSING CALIFORNIA. ECNL CHIEFS HAVE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY A PERFECT ASSOCIATION. WE WE REPRESENT OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIRE AGENCIES WITH OUR ASSOCIATION. WITH HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO HEAR FROM ANY OF THE FIRE CHIEF THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND HELPFUL TIMES ARE AFFECTING. THEIR RESOURCES AND THE EFFECTS THAT THEY HAVE ON THE EMS SYSTEM. I CAN TELL YOU BASED ON ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING ON UP AND DOWN THE STATE HOWEVER IT AFFECTS DIFFERENT APARTMENTS- SLIGHTLY- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY- WE LIKE TO COOK OTHER COMMITTED TO CONSIDER A FEW FACTORS IN EVALUATING THE PROBLEM NUMBER ONE. WHAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF THE PROBLEM- WHOSE PROBLEM IS THAT. IT WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I DEFINITELY WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER A FEW FACTORS RELATED TO DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS. ARE THERE ANY SHORT TIME IS VERY SHORT TERM FIXES. ARE AT THEIR- LONG TERM SOLUTIONS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT TIME R. M. S. PERSONNELOF FIRST RESPONDERS ARE STUCK IN HOSPITALS WITH PATIENTS UNTIL THE HOSPITAL STAFF TAKES MEDICAL CONTROL OF THE PATIENT AND THEN WILL SAYS ARE PUT BACK TO THE IN THE SYSTEM. WHAT IS THE COST I'M GONNA TALK ON SOME OF THESE ANIMALS. BUT WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF THE FIRE SERVICE. THE FACT. IS THE EXTENT OF ALL TIME IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE FINITE RESOURCES SUCH AS A RELIGIOUS EMS PERSONNEL. ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE EMS SYSTEM. WE CANNOT RESPOND TO OTHER NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY IS ESSENTIALLY TO FAX THE NINE ONE ONE READINESS. THIS HAPPENS IN A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS LONGER FOR CALLS WAITING FOR A RELIGIOUS WHICH ARE STUCK IN HOSPITALS. THIS AGAIN DECREASES THE READINESS TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. IN ADDITION. FIRE PERSONNEL OFTEN FOLLOW UP WITH THE PATIENT TO THE HOSPITAL WHICH REDUCES STAFFING ON FIRE EQUIPMENT. THIS IS GOING TO REDUCE OUR ABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS TO RESPOND AND MITIGATE OTHER CALLS FOR SERVICE SUCH AS FIRES WILDLAND FIRES RESCUES HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCIDENTS AND OTHER MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. SO THIS PROBLEM IS IT. WELL AS WE ALL KNOW A LOT OF THE DATA THAT'S OUT THERE WOULD INDICATE THAT THIS IS A SYSTEM WIDE PROBLEM HOWEVER IF YOU READ EIGHTY- A DOCUMENT THAT WAS PRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE CALIFORNIA MERCY MEDICAL SERVICES A FLORIDA CAL EMSA PUBLISHED A PAPER CALLED THE TOOL KIT TO REDUCE AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD IT DELAYS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ASSOCIATED FACTORS CAUSING DELAYS SUCH AS DECREASED PATIENT OR IMPATIENT CAPACITY. NURSE PATIENT RATIOS POSSIBLE REGULATIONS LIMITING AREAS ARE CARE INABILITY TO RAPIDLY TURN OVER HOSPITAL BEDS AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. EXACTLY IDENTIFIES A LOT OF THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS AND SUGGEST THAT THESE ARE- ALL PROBLEMS ARE FOUND IN THE HOSPITAL'S NOT NECESSARILY ON ON THE NINE ONE ONE SIDE OF- EMS. SO WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION FOR HOSPITALS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WELL THE PROBLEM IS A LOT OF THESE ISSUES ARE ARE SO. ISSUES IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE REAL WE'RE RELYING ON OLD- TYPES OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE TODAY. I THINK TWO OTHER FACTORS NEED TO BE THEY'RE WHEN ASKED THIS QUESTION SO WHO'S HOLDING THE HOSPITAL'S ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS OR INACTIONS. AND THEN ARE THERE INCENTIVES TO FIX THE PROBLEM. CHANCE OF THE FIRST QUESTION IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE OVERSIGHT OF HOSPITALS ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR. FOR A PART ISSUES AND PAY AND ALL TIME. ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ARE THERE INCENTIVES TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I WOULD SAY HELLO BECAUSE PRIVATE AMBULANCES AND FIRE AGENCIES DON'T CHARGE HOSPITALS FOR LOST TIME WALLACE SAID ON THE WALL. BEGIN TAKING THEM OUT OF THE NINE ONE SYSTEM AND THE FIRE SERVICE AND PRIVATE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS. SEEMS TO BE SUBSIDIZING THE HOSPITALS A LOT OF REGARDS. SO ARE THERE ARE SHORT TERM FIXES AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. YES WE BELIEVE SO. SOME OF THE SHORT TERM FIXES THE CONSIDER OUR HOLD HOSPITALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AN ACT IN ACTIONS WHEN IT LOOKS AT THE ABILITY TO FIX SOME OTHER INTERNAL PROBLEMS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. ALSO DISINCENTIVE THE HOSPITAL STOCKHOLDER MERCY PERSONNEL THE HOSPITALS WHICH IS IT IS IN ESSENCE UTILIZING PUBLIC TAXPAYER FUNDS TO SUBSIDIZE THESE HOSPITALS AND SHIFT THE BURDEN TO OTHER AGENCIES. MANDATORY REPORTING AND DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS SO WE CAN BETTER IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND FUTURE SOLUTIONS. DEFINITELY SOME OF THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS WE LIKE TO LOOK AT AND YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT- GERMAN RODRIGUEZ THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE A VERY OUTDATED EMS SYSTEM. THE HOSPITALS ARE ARE ONLY ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY CAN DO BASED UPON THE SYSTEM THE EMS PROVIDERS ARE ONLY ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO- IN THE SYSTEM AS WELL AND WE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER A FORTY TWO YEAR OLD EMS SYSTEM WHICH IS WHICH IS WOEFULLY. OUTDATED AND DOES LITTLE TO GIVE HOSPITALS AND EMS PROVIDERS THE TOOLS WE NEED TO FIX THE PROBLEM IN FACT. THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE THAT WERE WORKING ON A RIGHT NOW ARE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY AND IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS TODAY BASED UPON- THESE REGULATIONS. TRANSIENCE SYSTEM IS FAILING BECAUSE OF AN OUTDATED REGULATIONS INCREASED DEMAND FOR SERVICE. LACK OF INNOVATION AND A LACK OF WILL TO FIX THE PROBLEM CALIFORNIA WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN DEVELOPING THE EMS SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR ENCOURAGES COMMITTEE TO TAKE A DEEP LOOK AT OUR EMS SYSTEM AND TAKE THE STEPS NEEDED TO CREATE A BETTER SYSTEM FOR TOMORROW AND CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S LONG TRADITION AND EMS AND BEING INNOVATIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHIEF GARC APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS OUR NEXT WITNESSES CHIEF DAVID WILLIAMS FROM THE CHINO VALLEY FIRE DISTRICT. CHIEF WILLIAMS VIA AUDIO. IT CHAIR. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY HERE AND ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING PUBLIC SAFETY IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MY NAME IS DAVE WILLIAMS AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS A FAR CHEAPER THE CHINO VALLEY FIRE DISTRICT I AM ALSO HERE TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE MANY CHALLENGES RELATED TO EVIDENCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS AND OTHER KEY ISSUES THAT CONTINUE TO PLAY AT THE PLATE THE FRAGILE EMS SYSTEM IN SAN BENITO COUNTY. EMS SYSTEM IS TRULY AN ECOSYSTEM AND FOR EVERY ACTION AN ECOSYSTEM THERE CAN BE AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION OUR SOLUTIONS BUT NOT MUST NOT BE HERE OR WHAT SHOULD CONSIDER ALL BIBLE. YEAH HELLO. WE SHOULD GO. EXTENT WALK I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL'S FOR BE REMISS IF WE ARE FOCUS. ON SYMPTOMS RATHER THAN THE DISEASE OVER WITH COST THE TRIP PATHWAY NEED TO BE PRONGED AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ALL A FEW TREATMENTS IN SOME. AS A WALL TIMES CONTINUED IN ACROSS THE STATE. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS IS THE AMBULANCE DELAYS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN OUR COMMUNITIES ON A DAILY BASIS. THIS IS THAT THIS HAS BECOME ARGUABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY MEDICAL PRICES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. THESE DELAYS ARE SIGNIFICANT JEOPARDIZING PUBLIC SAFETY. WELL IF I DISTRICT UNIQUE LOCATE ON THE WESTERN BORDER OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE BECAUSE THE ALREADY STRAINED EMINENT SERVICES HISTORICALLY CLASS AWAY FROM MY JURISDICTION. EIGHT PARK ISSUE INCREASES THE SEVERITY OF THREATEN MY COMMUNITY. WHEN AMBULANCES ARE BEING HELD AT LOCAL MERCHANT APARTMENTS DUE TO A PARK AND RESOURCES SHIPPED AWAY FROM THE CHINO VALLEY. IT'S ONLY A MATTER TIME WHEN A COMMUNITY MEMBER WILL LIKELY DIE. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET TO THE HOSPITAL. CHINO VALLEY BALL KINDS OF STE TIMES. OUR GOAL IS TO GET OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A CRITICAL MEDICAL CONDITION THE HOSPITAL IN THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS MANNER IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT THIS APPROACH INCLUDES. HOLDING RECEIVING HOSPITALS ACCOUNT FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION. IN INCOMING PATIENTS IN A RESPONSIBLE AND TIMELY MANNER AND BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS THAT PREVENT AGENCIES. FROM USING THEIR AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO ENHANCE THE PUBLIC SAFETY. PATIENTS HAVE TO WAIT ON THE WALL FROM THE HOSPITAL'S OR IN THE- FOR EXTENDED AMOUNTS OF TIME IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AS A COMMUNITY AS THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE A PART ISSUE WE WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER REWRITING OUTDATED LAWS. THAT SIMPLY DO NOT HELP THE CURRENT PRE HOSPITAL ECOSYSTEM USE ALL OF ITS CURRENT RESOURCES. AT CHINO VALLEY FIRE DISTRICT ALONG WITH DOZENS OF OTHER AGENCIES ARE WORKING TO COLLABORATE ON THIS PROJECT. TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION WITH THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MATTER. THANK YOU CHIEF WILLIAM THANKS AGAIN FOR COMMENTS. OUR NEXT WITH A WITNESSES ASSISTANT CHIEF ERIC SAILOR FROM THE SACRAMENTO FIRE DEPARTMENT. CHIEF SAILORS. HI EVERYBODY- CAN I SHOULD THERE WE GO WAITING SHARE MY SCRIPT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR HEARING THIS TESTIMONY. RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEWS STORY IN SACRAMENTO THIS IS A FAMILIAR SCENE OF OURS. THIS JUST SHOWS THE IMPACT OF THE AMBULANCE IS BEING HELD UP AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S A MIX OF AMBULANCES BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC HELD UP AT ONE HOSPITAL. THE DATA THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW FOR STUDYING THIS PROBLEM IS THAT OUR RESPONSE TIMES ARE REACHING A VERY CRITICAL POINT AS WALL TIMES HAVE GONE UP OUR RESPONSE TIMES IN THE DOWNTOWN CORE OF SACRAMENTO. ARE STARTING TO GET NEAR TWELVE MINUTES. EVERY TIME WALL TIMES GO UP OUR AMBULANCE RESPONSE TIMES GOES UP. TO TRANSFER SHOULD TAKE NO MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES AND LAST YEAR WE WERE HELD ON THE WALL FOR OVER TWO HOURS MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS IS THE DATA THIS IS WHAT THE PICTURE LOOKS LIKE BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT MEANS TO PATIENT CARE THIS IS ONE PARTICULAR CALL THAT JUST HAPPENED LAST WEEK. WERE A WITNESS TO REST HAPPENED IN THE DOWNTOWN CORE OF SACRAMENTO VERY CLOSE TO A MAJOR HOSPITAL- WITNESS REST MEAN THAT MEANT MEANT THAT THE PATIENT STOPPED BREATHING AND THEY LOST THEIR HEART RATE. SO BYSTANDER CPR STARTED THE FIRST THING TRUCK ARRIVED ON SCENE AND STARTED CPR. AND WAITED FOR AN AMBULANCE. NOT RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. FROM THIS CPR THERE WERE TWO AMBULANCES SITTING ON THE WALL THEY'RE JUST. THE WAY THEY HAD ON THE WALL FROM MORE THAN OUR AND SOME OF THEM WOULD STAY ON THAT WALL FOR GREATER THAN EIGHT HOURS. IN THIS EVENT EVERY MINUTE COUNTS THESE WITNESSED CPR'S ARE WITNESSED ARRESTS ARE VERY STABLE EVENTS. BUT YOU HAVE TO GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL IN TIME AND RIGHT NOW YOU'RE SEEING MY AMBULANCES SET UP ACROSS THE CITY WAITING. ON THE WALLS. I HAD THE SHOULD THE MAN. TO SHOW YOU THAT'S CAN. SO THE AMBULANCE THE NEXT RESPONDED THIS CALL WAS NOT A SACRAMENTO. EIGHT MILES AWAY THREE CITIES OVER THANK GOODNESSWE HAVE A GOOD PARTNER IN AN AMAZING PART OF PART NEXT TO US IT WAS ABLE TO GIVE US AN AMBULANCE TO TRANSPORT THIS PATIENT. BUT THEY WERE TWENTIETH IN THE PIC FOR AMBULANCES MEETING THEY WERE THE TWENTIETH AMBULANCE THEY SHOULD HAVE RESPONDED TO THIS CALL. WALKABLE TO AMBULANCES SAT JUST A BLOCK AWAY. ON THE WALL. ALLEN THIS NEIGHBORING AGENCY GAVE US THEIR AMBULANCE THEY ALSO OPENED UP VERY ENTIRE DISTRICT. AND MADE ALL OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS VULNERABLE. SO I WANT TO MAKE THIS POINT THAT THIS IS THESE ARE TAXPAYER RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING USED RIGHT NOW TO STAFF HOSPITALS THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF CRIMINAL THESE ANIMALS ARE BEING HELD ON THE WALLS UP TO EIGHT NINE HOURS AT A TIME AND THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM AND THIS ISN'T AN ALL OPEN PROBLEM THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER A DECADE IN OUR REGION IF WE HAD SOLVED THIS PROBLEM IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE WOULDN'T BE IS BOUND UP AS WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND MOVING IN THE AMBULANCE FROM THE SYSTEM MAKES THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WORKS. HAVING ONE AMBULANCE IT ON THE WALL JUST REMOVES ONE MEDICAL RESOURCE FROM THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY IT ALSO CREATES INCREASES THE PATIENT'S CRITICALITY MEANING THAT EVERY MINUTE COUNTS AND WE MAY RESPOND TO A MINOR PATIENT BUT IF WE TAKE MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO GET IN THE HOSPITAL THAT MAY TURN INTO A CRITICAL PATIENT THEN OCCUPIES. AND I ZERO. SO QUICK SMART GOAL FOR SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE TO MOVE FORWARD. I QUIT THIS CHIU THE OLDER OSHA LAWS THAT FINES WERE REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGED BEHAVIOR AND UNDER TITLE TWENTY TWO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO UP. IT FIND THE HOSPITAL'S FOR ANYTIME THE HOLES OVER THE WALL FOR OVER TWENTY MINUTES. WE ALSO HAVE THAT SAME ABILITY IN THE HIT HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. AND ALSO TO REPORT DEMAND AS ADVERSE EFFECTS TRUE A TRANSFER OF CARE COULD NOT TAKE ANY MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES IN ANY AND EVERY TIME THAT HAPPENS THE HOSPITAL SHOULD BE FINE AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT MAY BE THE ONLY THING. THAT GETS INTO CHANGED BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHIU SAILORS OUR NEXT WITNESS IS DIRECTOR KEPT THE CHILDREN AFTER THE MERGER MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY DIRECTOR FROM THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DIRECTOR JOE DYSTER ARE YOU THERE YOU VERY MUCH. IN THANK YOU. CABBAGES DURING THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY LOS ANGELES COUNTY- I'VE BEEN DIRECTOR FOR SIXTEEN YEARS I'VE WORKED IN EMS AGENCY AND I'VE BEEN IN HEALTH CARE FOR MUCH LONGER THAN THAT- WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR HOSPITALS ARE ARE DEPARTMENTS. AND ARE ONCE COMPANIES AS A TEAM TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. OUT I THINK PEOPLE WILL TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS- AND HOW THE PROBLEM HE WITHIN THE HOSPITAL- HOSPITAL IS WORKING- WILL BE TALKED ABOUT BY MANY PEOPLE BUT I WANTED TO ADDRESS FROM MY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE HOW. WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE ISSUE OF ONE TIME- I BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE I WANT TO SEE WHAT DOES NOT WORK- TO ADDRESS WELL TIME. WHAT DOES NOT WORK- TOLD CAMPUS OUT THERE'S BEEN MANY TOOL KITS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS THEY SEEM TO YOU ALTERNATELY LANGUISH ON A COMPUTER FILE SOMEWHERE DUE TO CHANGES IN STAFFING. DUE TO CHANGES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL AND DUE TO CHANGES WITHIN PRIORITIES ARE WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S THOUGH- I DO NOT. ADVOCATE FOR TOLD CATS. I MEDIAN WITH HANS C. WE TRIED TO. INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS AND WORK WITH THE C. E. O.'S TO YOU TALK ABOUT- THE PROBLEMS WITHIN THEIR HOSPITAL AND GIVE THEM SOLUTIONS OFFER THEM TOOL KITS. THIS IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION C. E. O.'S. HAVE A POT OF POSITIVE AFFECT OF MOMENTARILY IT SEEMS WHEN THE C. E. O. MOVES ON IT WHERE THEY HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES I'M BEGINNING TO GO RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE WERE WITH A LOT. I THE VERSION POLICIES L. A. COUNTY HAS A PLETHORA OF DIVERSION POLICIES THAT ARE VERY COMPLEX. ON THE THEY GO FORWARD CAN BE READ FOR PAGES OUT THESE ARE SHORT TERM RELIEF VALVES FOR THE HOSPITALS TO DIVERT AMBULANCES TO OTHER AREAS. AND OTHER HOSPITALS THAT CAN ASSISTANTSHIP DIVERSION AND WHEN EVERYBODY'S ON VERSION OF. THE PERSON. SO I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO WHAT SUCCESS I SEAT WITH MITIGATION STRATEGIES- I DO AGREE THAT IT IT'S NEEDS TO BE A FINANCIAL SOLUTION. SO. THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE THAT WE'VE SEEN. NEVER MISS THAT'S WHYBUT I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD HERE L. A. COUNTY AS ANY CONTRACTS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE HOSPITAL FOR A SPECIALTY CENTER SUCH AS- OUR STROKES CENTERS PROMISED THEM STAMP CENTERS. ONCE WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE HOSPITAL AND THEY ARE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM WHICH IS A GOOD THING FOR THE HOSPITAL. IT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE EACH THESE PATIENTS DO COME WITH SOME TYPE OF UP HERE SOURCE TO THE HOSPITAL ONCE WE HAVE THOSE AGREEMENTS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT IN THE AGREEMENT. FOR INSTANCE WE ARE STROKES CENTER AGREEMENT- THE HOSPITALS HAVE AGREED TO CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANY IN HAVE- THE PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANY ON STAND BY TO GO PICK UP. AT TRANSFERRED STROKE PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITAL SO THAT THE HOSPITALS DO NOT CALL NINE ONE ONE TO GET THAT EACH AND TRANSFERRED TO A COMPREHENSIVE STROKE CENTER SO WHAT HAS BEEN ONE TOOL THAT IS I'M GIVEN A MINOR RELIEF BUT IT'S THE SMALL. THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH WITH OUR PROVIDER AGENCIES AND HOSPITALS TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF A POT- WE ALSO HAVE IMPLEMENTED IN OUR DIVERSION POLICY IF A NINE ONE ONE RECEIVING HOSPITAL THAT IS A SPECIALTY CENTER SUCH AS A STROKE. CENTER OR- YEAH. IF THEY A ACT NUMBER INDIAN. WAITING WEEKS THAT DAMASCUS. AND THAT AFFECTS THE- FOR. BECAUSE THEY HAVE STAFF FOR THOSE- SPECIALTY PATIENTS TO COME IN AND A GOOD AT MOST MOST PATIENTS COME IN WITH A GOOD PAIR SOURCE. SO AGAIN THAT'S A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO KEEP THE AMBULANCE IS- MOVIE. SO ANY CONTRACT WITH THE NINE ONE ONE RECEIVING HOSPITAL SHOULD HAVE LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES PAYMENT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING. TO IMPLEMENT THOSE THAT OUR SYSTEM- BUT THEY SHOULD BE BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE AMBULANCE COMPANY FOR WAITING TIMES. ARE A SPEAR NOT NECESSARILY THE HOSPITALS ARE ALREADY OVER REGULATED THERE ARE ALREADY PUNISHED WITH FINANCIAL. PUNISHMENTS WHICH IS NOT THE ANSWER BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY A FAIR WAGE I TO THAT ONE'S COMPANY. THAT IS WAITING FOR WE WERE LOOKING A OVER AN HOUR. THE COMPANY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BUILD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HE SHOT THAT THEIR CITY WEST. ON THIS CAN BE DONE. TO WHERE IT WHEN THE P. CO THEN ARE SIGN IN BY THE- AND THE M. COMPANY. OUT BY NURSE AND THE AWG CARE RECORD WITH THAT TIME-IS THAT MAN INTO THE HOSPITAL WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AND THERE IS A FAIR RATE THAT IS PAID TO THE AMBULANCE COMPANY. OFF FOR THEIR STAFF AND HAVING THE AMBULANCE WAITING AND BEING OUT OF SERVICE THIS WOULD BRING THE ISSUE TO THE LEVEL OF THE C. E. O. AND THEN THE CBO OVER THE COMPANY WHAT- I THINK THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT PROCESSES IN PLACE TO MOVE THE AMBULANCES AND RELEASE THEM. MORE QUICKLY HOSPITALS ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE HAD IN OUR SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN HELPFUL ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CALL BIG PANDEMIC. HAS HAVING HOSPITALS HIRE EMTS ALBION'S OR OTHER MEDICAL STAFF TO MONITOR THE PATIENT'S AND RELIEVE THE AMBULANCES AND GET THEM BACK INTO SERVICE MORE QUICKLY. THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT HOSPITALS CANNOT HIRE THIS ADDITIONAL STAFF TO YOU RELEASED THE AMBULANCES ARE AND LIKE. I SAID WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH THAT. WE DON'T STAY ON THE HOSP- ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT THE HOSPITAL CAMPUS ADDITIONAL STAFF. SO WE ARE NOT ON THE HOSPITAL WE NOTICED THAT THE HOSPITAL THEY MOVE ON TO OTHER THINGS THEY GET OTHER PRIORITIES AND THESE THE STAFF BEING EXTRA STAFFING SEEMS TO GO AWAY. SO AGAIN THAT WOULD BE A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION THAT UP IN A SYSTEMS CAN POINT INTO WORK SOME OTHER MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THE HOSPITAL HOW DOES IT IS JUST NOT STOPPING. SO ALL. PRACTICES NOT PUNISHING HOSPITALS WE NEED TO WORK AS A TEAM WITH THE HOSPITAL'S DIVERTING SPECIALTY CARE PATIENTS ALLOWING AMBULANCE COMPANIES TO BILL I THINK AFTER MY THIRTY YEARS HERE AT IT WITHIN THE EMS AGENCY AND WORKING WITH THE IS A POT ISSUES AND TOOL KITS- I THINK THAT THIS IS A MORE REASONABLE RESPONSE AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THE HOSPITAL TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THESE PATIENTS SO IN CONCLUSION. WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THE MISSION OF CARING FOR THE SICK AND INJURED ANOTHER THINK RING COBIT HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN MADE TO BE POSSIBLE FOR SOCIAL ASPECTS OF PATIENTS GETTING HOMELESS OF PEOPLE CONNECTED ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE NOT NECESSARILY BUT THE HOSPITAL SHOULD BE DOING MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE IN THE HOSPITAL'S HOSPITAL SHOULD BE CARING FOR THE SICK AND THE- INJURED. AT THE THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN RIGHT. FORCED ON THAT ADDRESS SOCIAL ISSUES WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS. AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY REMAIN VIABLE AND THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEIR MISSIONS TO TRANSPORT THE SICK AND INJURED. AND FINALLY WE NEED TO IDENTIFY A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT THE HOSPITAL'S PURELY PAY OFF FOR THE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS AND FIRE DEPARTMENT STAFF- THAT ARE WAITING AND AGAIN I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. I TO GET THE HOSPITAL'S TO YOU TO MOVE ON PATIENTS AND GET THE AMBULANCE IS BACK IN THE SERVICE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK TODAY I AM HAPPY. TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER. THANK YOU. DIRECT OUR NEXT WE- MISTER BRIAN HENDRIX A RESPONSE. MR HENDRICKSON. GOOD MORNING JERRY RODRIGUEZ AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS SAM AND I'M A REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE AND REACH AIR MEDICAL SERVICES IN MARIN REACH ARE THE LARGEST GROUND AND AIR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA- I PERSONALLY WORKED AS A PARAMEDIC AND HAVE MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OF HIM AS EXPERIENCE IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A AMMAR'S EXPERIENCE BUT AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS IN THE IMPACT THEY ARE HAVING ON OUR PATIENTS AND CARE GIVERS AND THE STRESS THEY ARE COSTING. THE MS SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND ON STATION OFFLOAD DELAYS HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS DESPITE MANY EFFORTS OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM. OTHERS SPEAKERS TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE NONE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SEE INCREASING WAIT TIMES YEAR AFTER YEAR OUR AMBULANCE PATIENTS. WILL KOBE NINETEEN MAY BE WORSENING THE ISSUE OF THE AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO RECOGNIZE. THAT THIS IS NOT A TRANSIENT PROBLEM CAUSED BY A PANDEMIC BUT INSTEAD A SYSTEMIC ISSUE THAT REQUIRES URGENT ATTENTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE. WHAT SHOULD REMAIN AT THE FOCUS OF OUR COLLECTIVE DISCUSSIONS IS OUR PATIENTS IN THE IMPACT THAT THIS UNSOLVED CRISIS CONTINUES TO HAVE ON THAT. IMAGINE THAT YOU OR YOUR LOVED ONE CALLS NINE ONE ONE AND IS TRANSPORTED BY AMBULANCE TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL. ONLY TO BE REQUIRED TO LAY ON UNCOMFORTABLE INDOLENCE CARNEY ALONG A HOSPITAL HALLWAY FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS. DURING THIS TIME THE PATIENT IS NOT BEING TREATED BY HOSPITAL STAFF IS THE PATIENT REMAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AMBULANCE CAREGIVERS AND HOSPITAL STAFF ARE TOO BUSY. WE KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE THESE INSTANCES ARE NOT RARE OCCURRENCES. AND SOME CASES PATIENTS ON THEIR INCOME AS CARE GIVERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO WAIT OUTSIDE OF HOSPITALS AND THE BITTER COLD DUE TO A LACK OF AVAILABLE SPACE AND RESOURCES. PLEASE CONSISTENT DELAYS IN TRANSFERRING PATIENTS TO HOSPITAL CARE ALSO HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON PATIENTS THAT NEED TO USE NINE ONE ONE AND EXPECT A TIMELY AMBULANCE RESPONSE. SOMETIMES THESE AMBULANCE RESPONSES OR DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD DUE TO MULTIPLE AMBULANCES NOT BEING RELEASED FROM HOSPITALS FOR HOURS ON END. THERE HAS PROBABLY BEEN HARM TO PATIENTS BECAUSE OF THESE EXTREME ABOUT DELAYS AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO END IN SIGHT. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPACT ON OUR PATIENTS AND THEIR HEALTH IS THE IMPACT WE ARE SEEING IT HAVE ON THE INCREDIBLE HEALTHCARE WORKERS WE HAVE IN THE STATE. AEROBIC GYMNAST HEALTHCARE WORKERS HAVE SHOWN UP DAY IN AND DAY OUT DURING THIS PANDEMIC IN OUR SHIRLEY FATIGUED AND EXHAUSTED BY TE IMPACT IT'S HAD ON THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS WORSEN THE WORKLOAD FOR THESE CARE GIVERS AND MAKE THEIR JOBS MORE DIFFICULT. R. EMS THEY'RE GIVERS ARE FREQUENTLY FORCED TO STAY WITH THEIR PATIENTS FOR MANY HOURS AT LOCAL HOSPITALS. THIS OFTEN LEADS THAT I'M MISSING THE REST AND MEAL BREAKS PERIODS AND IN MANY CASES BEING HELD WELL BEYOND THE END OF THEIR SHIFTS. WELL OUR EMS CREWS DILIGENTLY TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS FOREGOING THE ABILITY TO TAKE A BREAK OR GO HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES AT THEIR SCHEDULE TIME. THE FREQUENTLY WITNESS POSSIBLE STACK EVEN JUST THAT. IN EMS CARE GIVERS HOSPITALS HAVE ESSENTIALLY CO OPTED OUR WORK FORCE TO FULFILL THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FACILITY ABILITY TO CARE FOR PATIENTS AS A SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT WE ARE ASKING OUR PROVIDERS TO BEAR THAT RELATES TO THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. WHILE OUR PERSONAL GAIN COOP THAT IS FREE HOSPITAL LABOR THEY ARE NOT CREDENTIALED BY THE FACILITIES TO WORK AS PARAMEDICS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM CARING FOR THESE PATIENTS BY STATE LAW. pNINETY SEVEN POINT ONE NINE FIVE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. EXPECTING EMS PERSONNEL THE TAKE ON PATIENT CARE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY ARE STRICTLY PROHIBIT PROHIBITED FROM SHOULD MEAN ASSEMBLY A LEGAL LIABILITY CONCERN FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. A WORKFORCE IS A CHALLENGE THAT ALMOST EVERY INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY FACING INCLUDING HOSPITALS AND EMS PROVIDERS. REGARDLESS OF WORKFORCE AVAILABILITY WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO INCREASE CAPACITY AT OUR HOSPITALS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STAFF TO CALL UPON HOSPITALS NEED TO IMPROVE THROUGHPUT AND THE CAPACITY GIVE THEIR EXISTING STAFF TO MANAGE ADDITIONAL PATIENTS FAMILIES AMBULANCES TWO PRIMARY. WE NEED OUR AMBULANCES TO BE READY FOR THE NEXT CALL AND WHILE I AGREE THAT THERE MAY NEED TO BE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR US TO MAKE SOME CHANGE THAT IS TRADING TRADING AT SEVEN THOUSAND NOT BECAUSE- WE KNOW WITH WORKFORCE LIMITATIONS THAT ASSEMBLY REIMBURSING THE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS FOR THEIR COST TO HAVE STAFF. AT THE FACILITY WILL NOT SOLVE OUR PROBLEM OF GETTING AN AMBULANCE THE NEXT NINE ONE ONE CALL. SIMPLY PUT THE OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS IS THREATENING THE STABILITY OF YOUR NINE ONE ONE EMS SYSTEM STATEWIDE. IN THE LAST YEAR AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE AMBULANCES MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOURS WAITING BEYOND THE TWENTY MINUTE MARK FOR A HOSPITAL BED AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AMBULANCE HOURS THAT WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR A NINE ONE ONE CALL. BASED ON STATE AND ON STRIKE TEAM REIMBURSEMENT RATES THESE HOURS COME AT A COST OF MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LAST YEAR ALONE. REPRESENTING SIGNIFICANT COST SHIFTING FROM HOSPITALS AMBULANCE PROVIDERS. ONCE PROVIDERS BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ARE BEING HELD CAPTIVE BY THIS LONG TERM PRICES HIGHER TO COMMITTEE TO PLEASE HEAR THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND HELP TO FIND IMMEDIATE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR HENDRICKSON. OUR NEXT WITNESSES CHEN WARMAN A REGIONAL LABOR REPRESENTATIVE FOR UNITED EMS WORKERS ASKED ME LOCAL. FORTY NINE ELEVEN MS WARMAN. HELLO MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR OPENING REMARKS EXPLANATION OF WHAT WE ARE FACING IN THE FIELD MY NAME IS JENNIFER WARMAN I WORKED FOR AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE IN SACRAMENTO PLASTER AND YELLOW COUNTY FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. EIGHTEEN OF AS A PARAMEDIC I AM ALSO A LABOR REPRESENTATIVE FOR UNITED EMS WORKERS ASKED ME LOCAL. NINE ONE ONE FOUR YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING INCLUDING THE POSSESS PERSPECTIVE- PUTS ON THE GROUND WORK FORCE. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF WALL TIMES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND HOW IT AFFECTS OUR PATIENTS MY FELLOW EMS PROVIDERS. AND THE IMPLICATIONS. WORKFORCE FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT WHILE TIMES ARE NOON IT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. EVERY WINTER FLU SEASON WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM TOO MANY PATIENTS NOT ENOUGH BEDS NURSES. I CAN REMEMBER BACK TEN YEARS STANDING ON THE WALL CENTER ROADS WILL BE OFFERED SNACKS BECAUSE WE'D BEEN THERE FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS. MOST RECENTLY THE WALL TIME ISSUE HAS GOTTEN WORSE I THINK BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD A BREAK FROM BREAKING THE COOPERATE. THIS PROBLEM IS TWO FOLD IN MY OPINION THE MOST IMPORTANT THE IMPACT OUR PATIENTS IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE HAVE PATIENTS. PATIENTS LAYING ON OUR EARNINGS FOR HOURS SOME AS LONG AS EIGHT. AND THEN IN A HALLWAY AT THE ER A GOOD PORTION OF THE TIME THEY'RE EDERLY PEOPLE WITH DISEASE PROCESS. AT HAS BEEN BEDRIDDEN AND UNABLE TO SIT IN A WHEELCHAIR IN THE WAITING ROOM THEY'RE STUCK O OUR JOURNEYS WHICH ARE NOT MADE FOR COMFORT. THEY'RE MADE FOR EASE OF USE OF USED DURING AN EMERGENCY THE PATIENTS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE THEY START COMPLAIN OF PAIN. SOME OF THEM HAVE ALZHEIMER'S OR DEMENTIA SO THEY BECOME INCREASINGLY CONFUSED- MOST OF THE ARTS HAVE A SUITE IN A HALLWAY BY A DOOR SO THE PATIENTS GET COLD OR HOT DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER. THEN WE HAVE THE PROBLEM OF THE PATIENTS NEEDING TO USE THE RESTROOM. AGAIN ATTORNEYS ARE NEED TO BE USED AS LONG TERM BEDS FOR PATIENTS SO TRYING TO GET THEM ON THE BENCH. IS DIFFICULT. THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THE IMPACT OF THE FIELD WORKERS. MOST OF THE TIME WE ARE STANDING IN THE HALLWAY. FOR HOURS WITH NO WHERE TO SET OUR FEET BACK LEGS AND HIPS START TO HURT. OUR JOB IS ALREADY TAXING ON OUR BODIES. BUT SPENDING HOURS UPON HOURS STANDING IN ONE SPOT. IS MAKING AN IMPACT ON OUR BODIES EVEN WORKS. WE ARE UNABLE TO TAKE BREAKS UNABLE TO EAT UNABLE TO GET A DRINK. THEN YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE CREWS OUT IN THE STREETS HAVING TO COVER THE- COVER EVEN MORE CALLS. BECAUSE THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF AMBULANCES AVAILABLE TO RUN THE CALLS. BECAUSE SO MANY AMBULANCES ARE SITTING IN THE HALL AT THE ER. SO THE CREWS RE GETTING BEAT TO THE GROUND RUNNING CALLS. AGAIN WITH NO BREAKS. EVER YOU TURN THE CRUISER BEING RUN TO RUN RAGGED. THE BURNOUT RATE HAS INCREASED PEOPLE ARE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY FATIGUED. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THESE UNPRECEDENTED. LONGTIME THAT CAN'T BE OVERLOOKED IS THAT. IS THAT IT LEADS TO A FIELD CREW HOLD OVER. WHICH IS WHEN ARE WE ARE UNABLE TO LEAVE ON OUR SCHEDULE AND OF SHIPS. IN PREPARING FOR THIS TESTIMONY TODAY I WAS TELLING MY FIFTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. ABOUT THIS HEARING AND THE TOPIC SHE WANTED TO INCLUDE THE POINT. THAT GETTING AWFULLY AFFECTS OUR FIELD CREWS. HOMES WHAT HOLD LIVES YOU END UP MISSING OUT ON PLANS THAT YOU HAD MISSED SEEING YOUR CHILDREN. MISSING HAVING DINNER WITH THEIR FAMILY WHICH. INCREASE THAN INCREASES THEY BURN OUT. I THOUGHT IT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE A COUPLE OF. SHORT EXAMPLES A FEW WEEKS AGO I HAD A BURN PATIENT. BAD 3240% BURNS COVERING. COVER SECOND DEGREE BURNS. THEY WERE IN A LOT OF PAIN AND I HAD ALREADY MAXED OUT ON MY PAYMENT ALLOWING A LOT BY PROTOCOL. WE WERE TOLD TO STAND IN THE HALL UNTIL THEY COULD GET IT GET A BED FOR MY PATIENT. FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER THEY FINALLY FOUND A PLACE FOR ME TO PLACE THE PATIENT. THERE ARE TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS HERE DESPITE THE WALL TIME OF FORTY FIVE MINUTES BEING SHORT. COMPARED TO OTHERS. FIRST MY PATIENT WAS IN PAIN AND THERE IT. I CAN DO FOR THEM. SECOND THE PATIENT HAD EXPOSED BURNS THAT ARE OPEN TO INFECTION. WE STOOD THERE IS MULTIPLE PEOPLE WALKED BY THE BEAR WITH VARIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEMS. THEY COULD HAVE BEEN. EXPOSING MY PATIENT TO MORE DIFFERENT. MORE TO MANY DIFFERENT POSSIBLE INFECTIONS. TWO WEEKS AGO ANOTHER WHATEVER AMBULANCE CREWS OUT ON THE WALL FOR EIGHT HOURS WITH A PATIENT I HAVE NOT WORKED A SHIFT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT I DIDN'T HAVE WALL TIME AT LEAST ONE OF MY PAY ONE OF THEM. OR MORE OF MY PATIENTS. BUT LABOR UNIONS STANDPOINT. ARE UNION MEMBERS WORK HARD THEY DESERVE A RAISE. AS BRIEFLY MENTIONED OF. THE CRUISER IN THE FIELD WITH LESS AMBULANCES TO COVER. WHICH INCREASES OUR- RESPONSE TIME. AND WE GET FINED FOR EACH OF THE LATE RESPONSES. OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN HERE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC THEY HAVE OVERCOME MANY ADVERSITIES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR THE COMMUNITIES THEY WORK AND- THEY'RE TIRED AND OVERWORKED WE ARE TOO. WEIRD TOLD ALL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH GUIDANCE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHICH MEANS IF WE TEST POSITIVE BUT A SYMPTOMATIC WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP. PUT ON IN NINETY FIVE AND GO TO WORK WE NEED SIX DAYS TO GET THROUGH THE PANDEMIC BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE AVAILABLE. AVAILABLE WORK FORCE TO DO THAT. MAKES OUR JOB WITHIN THE UNION HARDER OUR MEMBERS TO. SERVE BETTER AND AS DISCUSSED EARLIER OUR PATIENTS DESERVE BETTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MS WARMAN. OUR FINAL WITNESS FOR THIS PANEL IS FIRE CAPTAIN SEAN BURROUGHS WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF ALAMEDA COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL FIFTY FIVE. AND VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITYEMS COMMISSION- WITHOUT. THE CAPTAIN BERLE'S. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS SEAN BURKE WAS ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEAR VETERAN OF THE FIRE SERVICE AND CURRENTLY SERVE AS A FIRE CAPTAIN PARAMEDIC FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. ADDITIONALLY I SERVE AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA YOU MUST COMMISSION. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS WITNESSES. NEED A SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS AT A CRITICAL POINT. WHAT THE COULD NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS BEEN A SERIOUS AND COMPLICATING FACTOR IN THE SYSTEM CHALLENGES. IT IS ONLY EXPOSED THE LONG TERM CRITICAL WEAKNESS IN THE OPERATION ARGUMENT SYSTEMS THAT. FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN FAILING OUR COMMUNITY IT'S AMONG THE PUBLIC FAILURES AND THE SUBJECT OF THIS HEARING ALL THE WALL TIMES OR TIMES THAT AMBULANCES ARE FORCED TO REMAIN EITHER IN ADVANCE BAY. OR IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND HOSPITAL STAFF AND RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO TRANSFER PATIENT CARE. THUNDERSTRUCK THE STATE ARE BEING PUSHED TO THE BRINK. CONSTANT FALLS ASTERS WHICH ARE ONLY GETTING WORSE EVERY YEAR LAYERED OVER A MULTI YEAR PANDEMIC. HAVE PUSHED THE NUMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION. ALL TIMES ARE A DIRECT THREAT TO PATIENT SAFETY AND A SIGNIFICANT DESTABILIZING FACTOR IN THE EMS SYSTEM. MINUTEWOMEN IN YOUR FIRE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE CONTINUE TO ANSWER THE CALL DAN THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER THESE CHALLENGES ARE EXASPERATED BY THE LACK OF HOSPITAL RESOURCES WHEN TAXPAYERS MUST ON CRITICAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL INCIDENTS. FROM A FAR BETTER PERSPECTIVE. THERE TO MEASURE ROLE IN CRITICAL IMPACTS TO PATIENT CARE AND PATIENT SAFETY THAT WE EXPERIENCE. FIRST BARBARA PARAMEDICS ARE STUCK ON THE WALL CELEBRITY DEPARTMENT. NOT ONLY IS THIS THE LAND EDUCATION FROM GETTING CARE AT THE HOSPITAL BUT THIS TAKES CRITICAL NINE ONE ONE RESOURCES OUT OF THE FIELD. SECOND PART PART PARAMEDICS ARE CONSISTENTLY WAITING ON SCENE FOR AN AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE WHEN ZERO AMBULANCES ARE AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. AS I NOTED IN MY OPENING I WORK FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WE DO NOT TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITAL IN THE COUNTY BUT PARAMEDICS FROM MY DEPARTMENT ARE CONSISTENTLY FIRST ON SCENE. WHEN PEOPLE CALL NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. EARLY ON A CAREER THAT SPANS OVER TWO DECADES WE REGULARLY ARRIVED. ON SCENE WITH THE PRIVATE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS SIMULTANEOUSLY. TODAY IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR OUR PARAMEDICS TO START RENDERING AID TO A PATIENT AND THEN WAIT THIRTY MINUTES OR MORE FOR AN AMBULANCE ARRIVAL TO TRANSPORT THAT PATIENT TO THE HOSPITAL. I PERSONALLY WAITED LONGER THAN EIGHTY MINUTES. YES EIGHTY MINUTES ON SCENE FOR AN AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE. ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. THESE WAIT TIMES ARE NOT A NEW PHENOMENON IN THE EMS SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN FACT. SERVICES BEEN DEALING WITH THESE TYPES OF DELAYS. FOR FIVE PLUS YEARS. OUR COMMUNITIES USE THAN I WANT SYSTEM WHEN THERE IS AN URGENT THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILIES THEY RIGHTFULLY EXPECT FAST RELIABLE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FROM THEIR EMS PROFESSIONALS ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE'S LIFE IS ON THE LINE. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE TELLER CITIZEN OF THE LARGEST STATE IN OUR NATION THAT THEY MUST WAIT TO RECEIVE CRITICAL MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO AMBULANCES AVAILABLE TO TAKE THEM OR THEIR LOVED ONES TO THE HOSPITAL. WE URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO EXAMINE ALL THE DEFICIENCIES IN THE WAY THE AMBULANCE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CURRENT LIMITATIONS ON FIRE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO OFFER RESOURCES. BUT FOR TODAY'S FOCUSED WALDHEIM'S MCCORMICK IMPACT RESOURCES OUT OF SERVICE AT THE E. D. INTRODUCED ACCEPTABLE DYLAN'S IN THE FIELD. THESE UNNECESSARY AND AVOIDABLE DELAYS HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE DELAYS IN THE CONTEXT. OF THE IMPACT ON THE INDIVIDUAL. RECENTLY AS THECALL NINE ONE ONE DUE TO WORSENING CHEST PAIN. FIREFIGHTERS ARRIVED ON SCENE IN UNDER FIVE MINUTES. AS A FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS BEGAN TO ASSESS AND TREAT THE PATIENT THEIR SYMPTOMS WORSEN TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE THE PATIENT LOST CONSCIOUSNESS. I REQUEST WAS MADE FOR A TRANSPORT IN AN ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL. FOR THE MEDIC UNIT TO ARRIVE ON THE SCENE THE RESPONSE THE PATIENT WOULD HAVE TO WAIT AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE ADDITIONAL MINUTES UNTIL THE END IT'S GOING TO RISE. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DETERIORATED AND EVENTUALLY WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST. THE FIREFIGHTER PROJECTS CONTINUE TO TREAT A PATIENT WITH ALL THE ADVANCE CARE THEY CAN PROVIDE. THEM THAT UNIT FINALLY ARRIVED ON THE SCENE NEARLY THIRTY MINUTES AFTER THE INITIAL NINE ONE ONE CALL. FORTUNATELY IN THIS CASE THE PATIENT WAS REVIVED REVIVED BY THE FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS. BUT NOT ALL PATIENTS EXPERIENCE THE SAME OUTCOMES. AND FOR SOME. EXTRA MINUTES COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE WHEN DEALING WITH MEDICAL EMERGENCIES TIME IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. AMBULANCE PROVIDERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR EMS SYSTEM DELIVERY POSSESS THE VEHICLES TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO IT FACILITY TO RECEIVE THE DEFINITIVE CARE THEY NEED. AMBULANCES SITTING HOSPITALS UNABLE TO OFFER THEIR PATIENTS SOMETIMES FOR HOURS IS THE ANTITHESIS OF THE PATIENT CO OUR CITIZENS DESERVE. AND PUTS AN UNNECESSARY STRAIN ON THE REST OF THE SYSTEM. OFTEN WAKING CRITICAL MOMENTS NEEDED TO SAVE A PATIENT'S LIFE. ALL THE CURRENT OPERATE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WATER DANGEROUS THERE ARE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES. FOR EXAMPLE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. THE CITY OF HAYWARD RECENTLY BEGAN BEGAN TO DISPATCH AND RESPOND WITH THEIR OWN AMBULANCES WITHIN CITY LIMITS. TO PROVIDE SEARCH PROTECTION WHENEVER THEIR FIREFIGHTERS ARE ON SCENE OF CRITICAL PATIENTS. AND NO PRESS RELEASES ARE AVAILABLE. THIS PROVIDES A LETTER PROTECTION WITHIN THE CITY OF HAYWARD AND INSURERS. THERE CITIZENS RECEIVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DEFINITIVE CRITICAL CARE AND DO SO IN A MATTER OF MINUTES NOT HOURS. OUR DEPARTMENT STRUCK CALIFORNIA ARE EMPLOYING CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO PATCH THE SYSTEM TOGETHER BUT MORE AMBULANCES IN THE SYSTEM STILL MEANS MORE AMBULANCES ON THE WALL. IF THE ROOT PROBLEM IS NOT ADDRESSED. I GENERALLY APPRECIATE APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN HEARING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF THE BEEN RPMS SYSTEMS AND SINCERELY HOPE THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO COME VERY SOON TO ADDRESS CRITICAL WALL TIMES BUT ALSO REAL QUICK A SYSTEM CREATED OVER FORTY YEARS AGO. THAT IS FAILING OUR COMMUNITIES. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. THANK YOU CAPTAIN BERLE'S- NOW WITH THAT WILL BRING IT BACK HERE TO THE COMMITTEE- I'M A LOST FOR WORDS AFTER IN THE TESTIMONY FROM EVERYBODY IT'S FRUSTRATING MORE THAN EVER. TO CONTINUE TO HEAR THIS ISSUE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES AND OVERSEE THE PANDEMIC COULD JUST ELEVATED TO ANOTHER LEVEL. AND QUITE CLEARLY TO ME WERE OPERATING IN A CRISIS MODE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE MERGING DEPARTMENTS ARE FOR SPONSORS- IT'S VERY CHALLENGING- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM ANYBODY THAT FROM THE FIRST PANEL- WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO NOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW I KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY SO MANY THINGS OF- GOING THROUGH MY MIND FROM HEARING FROM. EVERYBODY BUT ANYTHING IMMEDIATELY THAT WE CAN TAKE A STEP TO START ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE. ANYONE WOULD HAVE A ANY THOUGHTS OR SUGGESTIONS ON THAT. THIS IS CHIEF SAILORS ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME YES WE'RE HERE CHIEF- THE HOSPITALS CAN AFFORD TO HIRE PARAMEDICS ND AT LEAST CREATE A FROM ONE PARAMEDIC TO THE NEXT WE DID A TRIAL RUN IN SACRAMENTO WHERE WE ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE PARAMEDICS TO WAIT OUT TO THE HOSPITAL'S AND TRANSFER THE PATIENTS. WHEN WE TRANSPORT WHEN WE TRANSFERRED ONE PATIENT FROM OUR AMBULANCE TO THE PARAMEDIC WAITING ON SCENE- THAT AMOS WAS ABLE TO ONE FIVE CALLS WHILE THAT ONE PATIENT WAS WAITING WITH THAT HERMETIC ON AT THE HOSPITAL THAT TRIAL WORKED I KNOW THE STATE IS TRYING TO DO IT AGAIN WITH HIM OF PARAMEDICS BUT THAT CAN AT LEAST GET OUR AMBULANCES OFF THE WALL. I'D STILL ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THAT ARE NEGATIVE FINANCIAL CENTRAL HOSPITAL CAN THE IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW WITH TITLE TWENTY TWO SUGGESTIONS ON THAT. I THINK THIS IS YOUR I AGREE I THINK FOR AN IMMEDIATE FIX- THE HOSPITAL'S A NEED TO EITHER HIGHER OR BE SUPPLIED WITH- PARAMEDICS EMTS LPN OR CNA. Q. AT SS THE PATIENT AND ES IST WITH TAKING THE PATIENT OPPOSITE EVERYONE SECURITY MONITORING PATIENT FOR THE HOSPITAL WE ACTUALLY HAVE OUR HOSPITALS LAKE COUNTY HAVE ACCESS TO TENANTS ADDITIONALLY. FOR ADDITIONAL SPACES. THE PUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY FIX I AM STATE THAT WE NOT QUITE MODE I DO FIND THAT WE ARE NOT TREATING THE HOSPITALS AS THEY ARE IN A CRISIS MODE AT THE HOSPITALS HAVE ASKED FOR STAFFING RELIEF- AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED FOR ANY STAFFING RELIEF. FOR I EAT RATIOS THEY HAVE ARE STILL EXPECTED TO OPERATE AS A NORMAL DAILY BASIS BUT ALL THE REGULATORY PROCESSES. AT THROUGH THIS CRISIS SO WHAT THEY COULD GET SOME RELIEF AS LONG AS WE ARE IN THIS CRISIS MODE SO THOSE ARE SHORT TERM FIXES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY. ANYONE OUT- IT. YES TOM PARKER JUST SO SUPPORT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID FOR BECAUSE OF IT- MORE ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS- FOR- LOW ACUITY PATIENTS AND THAT BE A SUGGESTION THAT- I KNOW THAT THE A LOT OF LAMB SAYS A LOT OF THEIR FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER EMS PROVIDERS TO DO THAT ON MAYBE CONSIDER DOING- LOOKING AT THOSE PROGRAMS IN UP IN A MORE ABOUT A LONG TERM SOLUTION AND REALLY START WORKING WITH THE HOSPITALS AND OTHER ASSOCIATIONS TO. ALLOW US TO GET. MISSIONS THAT ARE LOW QT MEDICAL PROBLEMS TO US ALTERNATE DESTINATION ALSO LIKE UTILIZING A TELEMEDICINE- I KNOW WAS WAS TALKED ABOUT A LOT. AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN- KEEP PATIENTS FROM GOING TO THE HOSPITAL WHAT WOULD PROBABLY BE AN IMMEDIATE- FIX OUR WORK A LOT OF US ARE HAMSTRUNG WITH THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO. A LOT OF THOSE THINGS BASED UPON REGULATIONS AND SO ON SO FORTH SO ON I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF EMERGENCY- REGULATIONS THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE- I WOULD LOOK AT THOSE SYSTEMS. AND CONSIDER THOSE TO BE ARE ALSO NOT ONLY A SHORT TERM SOLUTION BUT CONSIDER THOSE FOR A LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE AND- I WOULD JUST TRYING IT AGREE WITH WHAT WE HEARD FROM EVERYBODY ELSE- ALREADY I WOULD CAUTION- THE COMEDIAN OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM- OPENING UP COMPLETELY- EMS PERSONNEL WORKING IN HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. THE ULTIMATE CONCERN THERE IS THAT WE END UP COMPETING FOR THE SAME- WORK FORCE- AND THAT CREATES THE SAME SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUES THAT I THINK WE'RE SEEING A HOSPITALS NOW ONE IMMEDIATE FIX- THAT I THINK SHOULD BE A CONSIDERATION- ON THE TABLE IS ESPECIALLY WHILE WEARING CRISIS- IS THE CURRENT- NURSE PATIENT RATIOS WHICH ARE ARTIFICIALLY- CREATING A THAT SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN HOSPITALEMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS I THINK. THAT BUT TEMPORARILY FLEXING- DURING TIMES OF CRISIS THOSE NURSE PATIENT RATIOS TO MAKE SURE PATIENTS GET TURNED OVER AND THAT NINE ONE ONE PATIENTS AREN'T LEFT WITHOUT- AMBULANCE OR FIRE PURCHASED BONTA RESOURCES- IS A CRITICAL STEP THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING AND REALLY APPLYING WITH WHAT WE SEE- ACROSS THE NATION- THE CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY ONE OF THE ONLY STAYED FOR THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS AS THEY EXIST AND- FLEXING THOSE- IS AN IMPORTANT RELIEF OUT. ANYONE ELSE ON THAT BEFORE HEADED TO NEWTON MEMBERS. THE QUICK CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ THIS IS A CHEAP ONES JIM VALLEY FIRE DISTRICT- I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE AGAIN THERE'S A LOTOF LONG TERM- SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE BUT- AS A AS A FIRE CHIEF THAT HAS RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PUT INTO THE SYSTEM. IT SIMPLY MAKES SENSE THAT THERE WOULD BE PROVIDED THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT BOB SHE TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE. EIGHT AND OTHER DELAYS WHICH IS THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM HOWEVER AGAIN WE DO HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT MANY JURISDICTIONS AND WE HAVE A DESIRE AND A WILLINGNESS TO- SUPPORTER COMMUTING AND WORKING WITH PHILIP RUBIN HECK UP SO. A CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO ALLOW FIRE AGENCIES TAT HAVE RESOURCES ASSEMBLY GET THEIR PATIENTS STREETS INTO THE HOSPITAL AND CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS- THAT THE LARGER OF A TOPIC THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS THE EIGHT PART ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WITHOUT THE- BECAUSE INTO MY COMMITTEE MY- THANK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD YET YOUR QUESTION. WHAT THE SUMMER SAY ARE DEL WRAP IT UP I DON'T YOU FOR ALL OF THE TESTIMONY- CLEARLY LEAD OUT THE KEYS THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE EMERGENCY THAT THAT WE'RE FACING HERE THROUGH THIS ON THE SYSTEM I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT WAS CHIEF CAKE- HAD MENTIONED DURING HIS TESTIMONY AND TAKE A LITTLE DEEPER AND POSSIBLY IN IN ONE THE RESPONSES TO. KARAGIAS AS WELL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE REGULATION UPDATES- WE KNOW WE HAVE SOME CAPACITY WE NEED TO IMPROVE I THINK TOTAL STAFFING FROM INOTES START TO FINISH- I WANT TO HEAR MORE FROM THE HOSPITAL- SYSTEMS WIDELY WILL HAVE THAT THE SECOND PANEL- WE CAN'T DROP OF COURSE THE PATIENT CARE YOU KNOW FROM- PICK UP ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT THAT WARM HAND OFF- BUT IF THERE ARE REGULATIONS THAT NEED UPDATING AND THAT IS SORT OF YOU KNOW LOW HANGING FRUIT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVES I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW MORE SPECIFICALLY. WHAT THOSE MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND THEN ALSO I'M WONDERING I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING THE TESTIMONY BUT I'M WONDERING ABOUT- WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN IN PRACTICE- WHEN YOU'RE GIVING A HEADS UP TO A HOSPITAL RIGHT SO YOU JUST DON'T SHOW UP AND THEN YOU START TO IN PROCESSING- ACTIVITIES RIGHT. HOW DO YOU HAVE THE WHOLE HOSPITAL- RECEIVERS KNOW WHO'S COMING HOW MUCH TIME YOU'RE COMING IN SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHORTEN THAT WINDOW AS WELL AND BE PREPARED- TO RECEIVE I I'D LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT- THAT PROCESS. DO YOU WANT TO. WEIGH IN ON ON THAT CIRCLE YOU'RE GOING. OKAY SO AS FAR AS REGULATIONS GO- I WENT TO PARAMEDIC SCHOOL OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO AND- THE SYSTEM THAT IS IN PLACE WAS LARGELY. THE SAME ONE THAT JOHNNY AND ROY WERE WORKING ON FROM EMERGENCY BACK IN THE DAY AND- THE PROBLEM WAS IS THAT WHEN YOU GET CALLED TO A NINE ONE ONE CALL. AND YOU HOPE YOU ARRIVE THE PARAMEDICS OUR ARE DOING THEIR JOB THEY THEY- THEY ASSIST THE PATIENT THEY START DOING TREATMENT OF THE PATIENT NOW WE'RE WAITING FOR A MELISSA GET THERE AND- THE ONLY OPTIONS WE HAVE CURRENTLY. ARE WE CAN EITHER TRANSPORT THE PATIENT TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. OR WE CAN- HAVE THE PATIENT SIGN OUT WHAT'S CALLED A MA WHICH IS AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE AND THOSE ARE REALLY THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE- IN OUR IN OUR REGULAR SYSTEM. NOW IF. IF WE CAN USE OUR DISPATCH WE HAVE A MERCY WILL DISPATCHING WE HAVE THAT IS A RESOURCE. WE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE THOSE PATIENTS THAT ARE MAYBE DON'T NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL OR WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO RESPOND ENABLES OR A FIRE DEPARTMENT THERE. WE CAN USE THE NURSE HOTLINE TO SEND THEM OVER TO YOU- IF WE DO GET ON SCENE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE ABILITY HOWEVER WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE- ABILITY TO REGULATIONS. TO USE TELEMEDICINE SO WE CAN HAVE A- FAR APARTMENT PARAMEDIC OR A NAMELESS PARAMEDIC ESSENTIALLY HAVE A PATIENT TALK TO A POSITION OR A PA ON A TELEMEDICINE CALL AND ACTUALLY GET THAT PATIENTS THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS. DOES EVERY SINGLE PATIENT NEED TO GO TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE- MEDICAL CARE FACILITY WHICH IS AN EMERGENCY ROOM NO THEY DON'T. ONE OF THESE PATIENTS OFTEN NEED LESS CRITICAL CARE THEY CAN GO TO URGENT CARE- THEY NEED TO POTENTIALLY GO TO A SOBERING SYSTEM. THEY POTENTIALLY HAVE BOB MAN- IS THAT THEY TO DEAL WE HAVE THE THEM TO. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE ONLY HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THEY GO TO. THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND THAT'S THE ONLY OPTION WE REALLY HAVE. SO AND THEN THE OTHER- I THINK THE CHIEF BOB WILLIAMS POINT. IS THAT THESE REGULATIONS THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE. ARE YOU LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT WASN'T TRANSPORTING BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY. DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE OPTION OF. A LOT OF DEVELOP OF DOING AMBULANCES AND ACTUALLY. ADDING TO THE- THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS OR USE A BILL AND SALAS. IF WE WERE DOING THAT PRIOR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY. AND THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THAT- CHIEF ONCE OUR COMMENT. IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. HOWEVER BUT BECAUSE THE REGULATIONS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT. SO THE POINT IS THAT. WE HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. TYPE OF PMS SYSTEM. AND THAT IS YOU EITHER GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR YOU DON'T GO AT ALL. THERE IS NOTHING IN BETWEEN. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUT THERE. THAT ARE SIMPLY NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED NOW AS FAR AS- WHEN WE NOTIFY THE HOSPITAL EVERY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO A HOSPITAL. N TO RECEIVING FACILITY. THE PARAMEDIC FROM THE EMPTY HOUSE TO CALL THE HELP THE HOSPITAL LET THEM KNOW THEY'RE COMING WHAT TYPE OF PATIENT OR THEY HAVE. AN APPROXIMATELY THEIR ETA OTHER ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL BEFORE THEY GET THERE SO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE PAY. IS NO. THE HOSPITAL THAT THEY'RE COMING WHAT TYPE OF PATIENT OF THIS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. NOW I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE HOSPITALS ARE ARE ARE INUNDATED. WITH PATIENTS THAT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE AT THE MERCY ROOM. HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER EMS AGENCIES TO. TAKE THOSE PATIENTS TO A MORE APPROPRIATE ARE RECEIVING FACILITY AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW- QUESTION. THINKING THANK YOU. VICE CHAIR- QUESTION COMMENT. THANK YOU- HER HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY THAT HAD LIVED AND- SO I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY- WEIGHING IN- I DID WANT TO CORRECT ONE PERSON A SAID THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR FIFTEEN YEARS- I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR PROBABLY JUST ABOUT MORE THAN FORTY- THAT'S WHEN I ENTERED INTO THIS SYSTEM. AND SO I DID GET TO WATCH IT EVOLVE ESSENTIALLY FROM EIGHT YEARS PRIOR THE INCEPTION OF THE PARAMEDIC PROGRAM. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAS EVOLVED AND I WANTED TO GET. SOME SOME COMMENTS FROM SOME OF THE CHIEFS IS. YOU KNOW THE USE OF THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND HOW THAT HAS INCREASED BY THE PUBLIC. AND IF THEY THINK THAT THAT HOUSE. BECAUSE THAT'S THE SUPPLY SIDE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SUPPLYING PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITALS. AND THAT HAS INCREASED. WHAT I'VE SEEN IS IT'S INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. AND AND I'M CURIOUS- IF THAT STATISTIC IS STILL. INCREASING BECAUSE OF HAS BEEN INCREASING FOR FORTY YEARS I CAN IMAGINE IF WE STILL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOSPITALS. WHICH I KNOW DOWN IN MY REGION WE'VE ADDED A COUPLE HOSPITALS- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS THAT HAVE NOT ADDED HOSPITALS AND THEY'RE STILL DEALING WITH A- THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE PATIENT LOAD TODAY THAT WAS MEANT FOR A PATIENT LOAD. BACK IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. IN IN THAT THAT ERA SO- FROM SOME OF THE CHIEFS AND CHIEF GUY GUY APPRECIATE. YOUR IT ENLIGHTENING US ABOUT THAT WHAT YOU'RE WHAT BASICALLY IS TALK ABOUT IS PREHOSPITAL TRIAGE. AND DECIDING WHO IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY TO GO TO AN ER- BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE OF THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT THAT'S ALSO INVOLVED THAT WEIGHS IN A LOT. THAT- EVERYBODY DOES NOT NOBODY WANTS THE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY OF TELLING SOMEBODY WITH A CUT FINGER THAT HEY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST NEED TO PUT A BANDAID ON THAT AND KEEP IT KEEP IT DRY WILL THREE DAYS LATER THEY HAVE A HEART ATTACK. AND YOU'RE BEING SUED MIXING NO YOU'RE BEING SUED BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TRANSPORT AND FOR THAT CUT FINGER THREE DAYS PRIOR. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS EVERYBODY MAKES THAT DECISION ON THEIR OWN AND THAT DECISION IS. OUT I DON'T CARE WHO WE GO ON WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE TRANSPORTING. AND THAT HAS LED TO AN OVER SATURATION OF YARDS. AND THAT IN TURN HAS LED TO IN IN CASES WHERE I WORK- THE CLOSING OF SOME VERY PROMINENT HOSPITALS DANIEL FREEMAN MEMORIAL HALL. IS NO LONGER I THINK IT'S AN APARTMENT BUILDING NOW AFTER THEY USED IT FOR TV. DRAMA ON THE ER AND STUFF- BUT- AND AS THOSE CLOSE DOWN GUESS WHAT IT OVER IMPACTED THE HOSPITALS THAT ARE ADJACENT AND CENTINELA HOSPITAL. RFK HOSPITAL CLOSED. SO IT JUST IT THIS SATURATION OF YARDS AND YET I DON'T CARE WHAT THE NURSE RATIOS ARE. I CAN TELL YOU IS IT IS A PERSON THAT. UNDERSTANDS THIS YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM. WHEN YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE THE NURSE RATIOS THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS ARE THAT ADEQUATE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO GET A HOLD OF YOU KNOW GET GET A NURSE THAT HAS. GOT SO MANY PATIENTS GOING AND HARD TO GET. HARD TO GET THEIR ATTENTION SOMETIMES AND IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT- THAT'S THAT'S THE SYSTEM IT IS OVERTAXED IT IS OVER. OVER DOWN WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY OF DOING- THAT PRE HOSPITAL PART OF IT- WHERE WHERE. WE CAN TELL PEOPLE WITH A CUT FINGER JUST WHAT YOU DO. AND THEY DON'T NEED TO GO TO THE ER SORRY GOT OFF ON A LITTLE RAN. BACK TO MY QUESTION FOR THE CHIEFS- THE CHANGES IN USE BY NINE ONE ONE BY THE PUBLIC- WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IN YOUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE YEARS OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT. THIS IS CHIEF SAILORS FROM SEGMENT CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE USE OF THE PUBLIC'S- ON NINE ONE SYSTEM IS INCREASING CONTINUES TO INCREASE OUR CALL VOLUME IS CLIMBING STEADILY YEAR BY YEAR. BUT TO YOUR POINT ON THE POTENTIAL SOLUTION. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN I PUBLISHED PAPERS RESEARCH PAPER LOOKING OUT THIS NOT ONLY COUNTRYWIDE BUT WORLDWIDE TO SEE IF ANYBODY WAS COMING UP WITH ANY VIABLE SOLUTIONS I DON'T SEE THE- FROM A SYSTEM STANDPOINT OF LOOKING AT. FROM PATIENT CARE FOR THE TIME IT DOWN ON A ONE TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL THE MOST VIABLE SOLUTION WAS SOMETHING CALLED HERE INTRIGUED. C. ENTRY ENTRY IN TRANSPORT AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT TRIAGE THE PATIENTS BEFORE THEY WENT TO THE HOSPITAL. IT WAS A QUICK CONVERSATION OVER THE PHONE TO EVALUATE THE PATIENT- THE U. K. IS CURRENTLY USING THIS AND THEY WANT TO DO A TELEMEDICINE SESSION WITH THE PATIENT. PRIOR TO ANY ONE GOING OUT SO THEY CAN GET THAT PERSON TO THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE A PROBLEM- BUT THIS WILL GET THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE E. R. A C. INTRIGUED AS THEY WILL SEND SOMEBODY OUT TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PATIENT EVALUATED MAKES THEIR VITALS ARE STABLE. DO TELEMEDICINE CONGRESS WITH A DOCTOR THE EXACT SAME THING GET ON TO THE SOLUTION THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE EVERY PATIENT IS A PROBLEM. JUST NOT NECESSARILY THE E. R. AS THE SOLUTION AND THE TREE TRANSPORT IS WHAT WE DO NOW. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PROGRAM IN THE U. K. IN TWENTY ELEVEN I KNOW DROP THE CALL GOING BY NINETEEN PERCENT. OF THE- NOW. A WE CAN'T COPY THAI. BUT IT IS A GREAT FRAMEWORK TO START FROM LOOKING AT A SYSTEM WIDE PROBLEM OF GETTING PATIENTS TO THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES. THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS THE ER SO THE DVR IS RESERVED FOR THE CRITICAL PATIENTS THAT ACTUALLY NEED. AND A FOLLOW UP ON THAT REALLY QUICK YOU CRITICAL PATIENTS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN A CRITICAL PATIENT GETS INTO AN ER. WHAT HAPPENS WITH ALL THE STAFF. THERE YOU GO WORK ON THAT CRITICAL PATIENT. AND THAT FURTHER REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE- TRYING TO TREAT THESE OTHERS TO GET THEM OUT OF THE BEDS SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE MORE PEOPLE COMING IN. SO I THINK THE ON PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- THAT- THERE ARE VERY SICK PEOPLE THAT GO TO THE ER AND- AND WHEN THEY ARE THERE IN ADDITION TO. WITH ALL THE RISK- THAT THAT THAT PERSON WINDS UP- DOMINATING THE- THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE. SO MANY OTHERS I'M SORRY GO AHEAD CHIEF. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN THE SAME AS ON THE PREHOSPITAL SIDE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE ARE RESERVED FOR THE MOST CRITICAL PATIENTS AND IT TAKES A TON OF RESOURCES- TO KEEP A CRITICAL PATIENT ALIVE AND WHEN WE DO ON THE HOSPITAL CRITICAL PAGE THEY DO AN EXCELLENT JOB- THERE ON A VERY FAST AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DESIGNED TO DO BUT TO YOUR POINT IT SLOWS DOWN THE THROUGHPUT OF ALL THE OTHER LOW ACUITY PATIENTS. THAT ARE WAITING IN BEDS OR ON THE WALL AND THAT JUST HAS A MASSIVE IMPACT ON A LOT OF THIS LITTLE CUTIE PATIENTS. THEIR PROBLEMS AREN'T NECESSARILY SOLVED AT THE ER THEY HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT HOUSE TO BE SOLD SOMEWHERE ELSE WHETHER IT'S GETTING A PURCHASE PRESCRIPTION FILLED OR WHETHER IT'S A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM IT'S VERY RARELY RESULT IN THE ER IN THE ER IS RESERVED FOR THOSE CRITICAL TRAUMA STROKES CARDIAC EVENTS YEAH SO IT'S A GOOD TO HEAR FROM THE DELIVERY SIDE OF THIS WHAT THEIR CURRENT RATE- THE TRIBULATIONS OF DOING THAT TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THAT. WE'RE GONNA GET TO HEAR FROM THE RECEIVING SIDE OF IT PRETTY SOON AND- AND THAT'LL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR- ALTHOUGH I KNOW A LOT OF I KIND OF UNDERSTAND BOTH AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT IT'S A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT TO WORK ON. AND WORK IN AND THAT TRANSLATES INTO IT NOT WRITTEN IT TRANSLATES INTO A LOT OF EMS PERSONNEL AND HOSPITAL PERSONNEL. HAVING ISSUES FROM YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THERE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE SWIMMING IN A POOL THAT THEY JUST CAN'T THEY THEY'RE NOT DOING WHAT THEY'RE TRAINED TO DO THEY'RE JUST DOG PADDLING. AND YOU KNOW PATIENTS DIE- YOU KNOW I I'VE SEEN PEOPLE HAVE EXPIRED BECAUSE THERE ON THE WALL TOO MUCH AND- IN THEIR UNDERLYING ISSUE WENT UNDETECTED- AND THEN BY THE TIME IT MANIFESTED ITSELF IT WAS TOO LATE FOR THEM- SO THOSE TYPE OF SITUATIONS ARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT EVERYBODY. NURSES. DOCTORS WE ARE STAFF CHIEFS BECAUSE YOU GUYS TO. HAVE TO MANAGE THE- OUTSIDE. AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW. WHEN YOUR RESPONSE TIMES- TEN MINUTES INSTEAD OF FOUR FIVE- HOW YOU FIX THAT WITH THE RESOURCES ESPECIALLY FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAT YOU'RE GIVEN AND THAT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU. AS AYE PLOT ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST TODAY ESPECIALLY AND SPEAKING TO THIS BODY WE REALLY DO NEED TO UPDATE THE SYSTEM AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. BETTER MANAGE HELPING PEOPLE AT THE LEVEL THAT THEY NEED HELP. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE AT A LEVEL A LOT OF HELP PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T REALLY NEED AND THAT IS CAUSING A- BACK UP- AND AN IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE THAT WE DO. THAT DO NEED THAT LEVEL OF HELL SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT'S ANOTHER CHIEFS I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GIVE YOU GUYS. CAPITA SIR IVAN CHEAP IN MY OWN MIND. YES YOU ARE I JUST. WENT IN TO SEE HERE I DO KNOW THAT WHEN THERE IS LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENTS- ARE. PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OUT. REQUIRES THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FIRE HYDRANTS AND FIRE STATIONS FOR THAT ELEMENT BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE LAW THAT REQUIRES THESE DEVELOP- DEVELOPMENTS TODAY HAVE ENSURE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY CARE. AND THAT MAY BE SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE THAT THEY THERE IS A SUPPORT OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE AREA AND ENSURING THAT THE HOSPITALS. AND THE EMS SYSTEMS. ARE AVAILABLE FOR THESE LARGE DEVELOPMENTS WHEN THEY'RE COMING INTO. WEST CITY OR AN AREA. YEAH THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE- PEOPLE. HAVE A LOT OF DO CALL GIVE IMPACT FEES FOR THE SUPPLIES AND LIKE I SAID FOR THE FIELD SIDE OF IT THE EMS. SIDE OF IT. WHAT IN AND IT TO AN EXTENT. THAT TRANSLATES INTO A LITTLE BIT OF BETTER SERVICE FOR BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL PART. AND IS A FORMER- CITY COUNCIL BURNED IN MAYOR WHICH- MANY OF US ARE- WE UNDERSTAND THE WATCHING IT CITY GROW AND NOT HAVING TO HELP HER YOU KNOW THE HOSPITALS. THAT YOU NEED IN TRYING TO GET THEM TO COME AND BUILD AND WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THAT MY AREA BUT- AT THE SAME TIME THAT DOES NOT ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM THAT THIS. OVER SATURATION OF YARS. WITH WITH THE CHANGING. NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC. JUST ONE OTHER THING BONTA SERMON. I CAN PUTT TALK REAL QUICK- IN SEVERAL COUNTY- WE DEVELOPED A PILOT PROGRAM AND THIS IS ONE OF OR PARTNER DISPATCH CENTERS- CAR FIRE IN IN SEMINOLE COUNTY. AND THEY THEY THEY BASICALLY STARTED A PILOT PROGRAM WITH THE MERCY COMMUNICATION- SYSTEM ALSO KNOWN AS THE C. N. S. AND THAT'S WHEN- WE HAVE A LOW CUTIE CALL THAT CAN BE TRANSFERRED- IT DOESN'T GO TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AT THAT POINT ACTUALLY GETS TRANSFERRED TO A- A NURSE. A TRAINED NURSE THAT'S ABLE TO TAKE THAT CALL AND PEOPLE THAT DON PATIENTS NEEDS- DIRECTLY AND THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS- IT'S NOT FUNDED. AND IT'S A IT'S A PILOT. BEING YOU KNOW PRUDENT BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO DO THAT AND IT IS PART OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE ULTIMATELY- THE PATIENT'S STILL GETTING A GOOD OF PATIENT CARE. HOWEVER THEY'RE NOT BEING PUT INTO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER- AS A AS A LONG. TERM SOLUTION BUT THAT WAS UP AND RUNNING IN SEMINOLE COUNTY AS A PILOT PROGRAM AND I KNOW THEY BASE THAT AROUND A RENO- STUDY THAT THEY DID IN THE PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE SO THAT'S JUST A CONSIDERATION. THAT THIS COMMITTEE MAY- LOOK AT- IN THE FUTURE AND ALSO HELPING FOR SOME FUNDING WITHOUT WOULD ACTUALLY BE. VERY HELPFUL AND ALLOW WOULD ALLOW US TO KEEP SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T BE. IN NINE ONE. OR AT THE HEART SAYS WELL IT'S JUST IT'S- THE SILVER BULLET BUT IT HELPS OVERALL- ON THE SYSTEM. THAT'S ALL I AFFECTED A GREAT THANK YOU CHIEF. MISTER JESTER I YOU'VE BEEN SO INVOLVED IN THE EMS SYSTEM FOR SO LONG- YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE THERE WHEN I WAS THERE. AND AND- SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE THE TITLE OF CHIEF BUT YOU'RE CERTAINLY A CHEAP LEVEL PERCENT. OF OF EMS IN L. A. COUNTY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU HAVE A QUESTION THEY THEY GET HERE FOR THE EQUITABLE FALL BUT ACTUALLY THE CHEAP ACTUALLY JUSTANSWER TODAY YOU KNOW IT WAS RECALLING ON THE GROWING CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE IN OUR REGION AROUND COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE IN THE ABILITY TO INTERVENE AND HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE- YOU KNOW BOTH POINT OF CONTACT BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT. THERE WAS A SOLUTION FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT IT NEED TO GO TO THE ER AND SO- OTHERS THAT- HEARTENING TO HEAR THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THEY'RE WITNESSING IN SAN BENITO COUNTY AS WELL AND- MAYBE THAT'S AN AREA FOR AND FOR INVESTMENT THAT BOTH- IS COST EFFECTIVE. ALSO RELEASE ON SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT WERE- YOU KNOW HEARING ABOUT THIS HEARING TODAY SO WE'LL LOOK INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. SO WITHOUT ALSO WANTED JUST TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS ON THE FIRST PRESENTATION. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR THOUGHTS. COMMENTS SUGGESTIONS- SOMETHING WILL DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP ON. OBVIOUSLY THERE THERE'S A LOT A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. TO DISCUSS THESE CHALLENGES WERE FACING ESPECIALLY IN OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM HOW IT'S EVOLVED FROM THE BEGINNING. TO TREAT THE SICK AND INJURED AND NOW IT'S DEVELOP IN. TWO OR DOING WHAT THE PANDEMIC AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT COMES WITH THAT- WE CAN GO ON FOR HOURS ON THE ISSUES THAT BROUGHT US FOR OUT BUT- HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND SOME SOLUTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR TODAY. SO WITHOUT WILL MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL. ARE WE ARE. ONCE AGAIN APPRECIATE YOUR TIME WILLINGNESS TO SHARE EXPERIENCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON OUR SECOND PANEL. WE WANT TO PREACH REMIND FOLKS TO TAKE KEEPER COMES FROM MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES WE HAVE ADEQUATE TIME FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. OUR FIRST WITNESS WILL BE MISSED THIS BASSINET. ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE MARCH MEDICAL SERVICES THIRTY DIRECTOR BASSINET ARE YOU THERE. YES I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN- GREAT. SO GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC- MY NAME'S ELIZABETH ABSENT ON THE ACTING DIRECTOR FOR THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY AND ALSO CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. I UNDERSTAND THAT TODAY THAT YOU'RE A MEMBERS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR CURRENT RESPONSE EFFORTS AS WELL AS OUR LONG TERM STRATEGIES TO. MITIGATE AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS- SO WILL KIND OF MOVE THROUGH THOSE BRIEFLY- AS THE NATION'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM DEALS WITH THE IMPACTS OF CARBON NINETEEN. THE EMS AS YOU'VE HEARD AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE MANAGING A LARGE INFLUX OF PATIENTS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS. AS WE KNOW THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL SYSTEM AS FULL CURRENTLY. AND THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OVERCROWDING SO FOR EXAMPLE- IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY JUST AVERAGING OUT ABOUT TWENTY NINE THOUSAND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS DAILY. NOW IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE'RE SEEING APPROXIMATELY AVERAGING FORTY FOUR THOUSAND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS DAILY. THESE NUMBERS DO SHIFT UP AND DOWN AND THIS IS AN APPROXIMATION BUT IT'S ALSO A TO SHOWCASE THE LEVEL OF THE VOLUME OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OVERCROWDING- THAT DOESN'T WANT TO THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT NOW- INSENSITIVE PHD WORK TOGETHER ARE THROUGH THE STATE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ARE SOME SYSTEM TO FILL THE RESOURCE REQUEST BUT WE'VE OFFICER REDEPLOYED OUR STATE SURGE OF SUPPORT PROGRAM SO. WE DO THIS IN THREE WAYS AND I FEEL LIKE THE BEST ANALOGY TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS KIND OF THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE INSIDE THE HOUSE AND THE BACK DOOR OF THE HOUSE IF OR SPEAK OF A HOSPITAL SO. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THE EMS SYSTEM. EMERGENCY ROOM OVERCROWDING WE ARE WORKING WITH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND HOSPITALS TO TRY TO HOBBIES TRIAGE UNITS OR TENS WHICH ARE ATTACHED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO HELP WITH THE OVERFLOWING OF EMERGENCY ROOMS. TO EXPEDITE THE TRANSFER OF CARE OF THE PATIENT AND TO ALLOW OUR AMBULANCES TO GET BACK IN SERVICES. AND WE DEPLOYED THOSE ARE WORKING. ON THE STATE WIDE OUTSIDE OF OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE. INSIDE THE HOUSE WERE DEPLOYING RESOURCES INTO THE HOSPITALS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THE PATIENT IS INDEED VISITING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND ADMITTED INTO THE HOSPITAL AND THE STRUCTURE. THAT THERE'S SUFFICIENT STAFF TO TRY TO- TRANSFER THIS PATIENT UP TO THOSE FLOORS AND THEY'RE NOT STUCK IN THE E. D. WAITING FOR AN INFINITE ADMIT TED SPREAD. AND THEN OUT OF THE BACK. DOOR ONCE A PATIENT HAS. AARON IS READY TO BE DOES EITHER EITHER TO THEIR HOME OR TO A LOW STEP JUST. WE TO MAKE THAT THERE'S NOT A HINDRANCE TO MOVE THAT PATIENT THROUGH THE- SYSTEM AND DECOMPRESS THE HOSPITAL SO WE WORK WITH SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND STEP DOWN FACILITIES. STAFF AND- MAKE SURE THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE TAKING THESE POSITIONS AND THIS ALLOWANCE MOVING A PATIENT THROUGH THE PATIENT'S CARE CONTEND YOUR- IS WHAT ALLOWS ALSO EMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND TO NOT SEE. THIS BACKLOG THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. PROGRAM WE HAVE OVER THREE THOUSAND MEDICAL STAFF DEPLOYED IN OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN FACILITIES RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE AND THAT NUMBER IS INCREASING EVERYDAY- TO TRIGGER- HAVE THIS IMMEDIATE SUPPORT TO THE FACILITY AND MITIGATE. AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD LOW DELAYS. SO THE CURRENT INSISTING LEVELS OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OFFLOAD DELAYS ARE DOING THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT AND I WANT TO SIMPLY SUMMARIZE THAT MEANT FOUR MAIN. AREAS RECALLING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN A PARTY PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS. IMPACTING THE MSN SYSTEM ABILITY TO RESPOND TO NINE ONE ONE. IT'S STRAINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRE HOSPITAL CARE AND HOSPITAL CARE OUR EMS SYSTEM OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM THAT ARE BOTH VITAL TO SUPPORT OUR PATIENTS. AND IT IS IT MAY COMPROMISE PATIENT CARE OUTCOMES. DAY SO I LOOKING FORWARD AND THIS A SOLUTION BASED CA. WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ALL HERE FOR. WE HAVE A KNOWLEDGE THIS IS A NEW ISSUE AND COBIT IS EXACERBATING SOMETHING THAT EXISTS. I THINK YOU KNOW THE GRADUAL INCREASE AS I THINK SOMEBODY MENTIONED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. YOU KNOW ANSWER AND CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION DID RELEASE A TOOL KIT ALTHOUGH NOT A TOTAL SOLUTION WE BELIEVE IT WAS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN EMS COMMISSION REQUESTED AND SOCKS TO COLLECT. DATA ON- WOULD WHICH WAS VOLUNTARY. TO FURTHER EVALUATE THIS- ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE SIXTY ONE MANDATED JULY ONE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT ALL THE LIMITS. FORGETS MADE THERE. ARE A PART DATA TO ANSWER EARLY AND THEN IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE COMMISSION ON ITS EVALUATION. SO IN THIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IN MID TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE EMS OF FORTY CREATED AN AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD TIME COMMITTEE. THIS COMMITTEE IS MADE UP OF SEVERAL THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS HERE TODAY. INCLUDING A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION NURSES ASSOCIATION LOCAL YOUR MASTER OUR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS AND THE OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO DRAW. RECORD FOR STATE LEADERSHIP INCLUDING CITY PAGE AND SO DIRECTORS ON HOW TO REDUCE AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD TIMES AND IS MEETING TWICE MONTHLY. I THINK MOVING INTO THE FUTURE WE MUST REMAIN DILIGENT AND THREE OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. ANY SOLUTION TO PUT PUT FORWARD MUST KEEP THE PATIENT AND THE CENTER OF ALL WE DO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE THE COMMUNICATION COLLABORATION OPENLY BETWEEN THE PRE HOSPITAL SYSTEM AND THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. AS WE SEEK TO OF ALL OF THESE INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS THOSE SOLUTIONS IF THEY'RE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER WILL TIME OUT WE LEAD TO THE BEST PATIENT CARE OUTCOMES. AND WE MUST ENSURE STANDARD. FOR TRANSPORT TO TRANSFER OF CARE DOESN'T CHANGE. AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE INCREASED WALL TIMES OUR GOAL MUST REMAIN AT TWENTY MINUTES. FOR AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD TIMES THIS IS THE STANDARD PRACTICE AND THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD. TOWARD SO I THINK AS- AND SUMMARIZING WITH FOUR MAJOR BUCKETS FOR SOLUTION. THIS IS WHAT WE BRING FORWARD. I THINK THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BY YOU FOR A LITTLE BIT OF POWER AND- WELL I DO NOT AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL HHS AND L. W. D. A. TO CREATE AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CORPS. TURNING YOUTHFUL ROLES AS EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS OF HOW WE CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES TO KEEP- TO KEEP THIS WORKFORCE GROWING IS KEY. THE SECOND MAJOR SOLUTION WOULD BE THE DATA I THINK. WE'VE TAKEN SOME VERY GREAT STOPS. TO ENHANCE OUR DATA ACCESS AND DATA REAL TIME DATA- AND IT IS SHE AND A SENSE FOR. DECISION MAKING INFORMED DECISION MAKING SO ENHANCING OR REFINING OUR DATA OPERATIONS. IS KEY. COLLABORATION I THINK. TO STRESS THE POINT MAINTAINING A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRE HOSPITAL CARE AND HOSPITAL CARE- ESPECIALLY THROUGH THIS A PART COMMITTEE PROCESS SO THAT WHEN THE COMMITTEE BRINGS THEIR RECOMMENDATION FOR WE KNOW THAT THEIR HOLISTIC COMPREHENSIVE AND ADDRESS THE ENTIRE PATIENT CARE CONTINUUM. AND THEN FINALLY WHICH I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TODAY IS OPTIMIZING THE SPOKES IN THE WHEEL OF THE PATIENT CARE CONTINUE ON. EVERY SPOKE ON THAT WHEEL IT'S EVOLVING OUR EMS SYSTEM AND OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ANALYZING AND LOOKING AT STRATEGIES FOR ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS TELEMEDICINE AND MAYBE EVEN THINGS WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF AN EVOLVING OUR HEALTH CARE IMPROVING ACCESS TO PAY FOR TAKING FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS. IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE FOR PRIMARY HEALTH PATIENTS- OPTIMIZING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THROUGHPUT AND EVEN WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT REVIEWING- ASSESSOR FOR POLICIES. I THINK THIS ALSO MEANS A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP. WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS FOR CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FOR REIMBURSEMENT EMS TRANSPORT TO ALTERNATE DESTINATION AND HOW WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS MAY BE IN A NEW WAY AS A NEW OPTION- WITH FAT- I CONCLUDE MY TESTIMONY AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR OF OUR NEXT WITNESSES DR CLAYTON HAZAN WHO IS THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE LOS ANGE COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. AND PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EMS PHYSICIANS- DOCTOR SON EITHER. I'M HERE YOU CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. MY NAME IS CLAYTON CAUSING AND I AM AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND EMS PHYSICIAN I'M PRESIDENT OF AS THE TERMS OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF YEMEN'S POSITIONS AND I AM THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. AS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THE HOSPITAL'S FACE WITH THE EVER RISING VOLUME OF PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE E. D. REPORT DIFFICULTY STAFFING SHORTAGES I WAS AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CHAIRMAN AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR AS WELL. NOT ONLY IN MY SENSE OF THESE PROBLEMS I EXPERIENCE THEM FIRST HAND WHEN I WORKED AT MY HOSPITAL AS IT DID LAST WEEKEND. BUT WE CAN'T ALLOW POSSIBLE CHALLENGES TO PARALYZE THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. ABRAMS'S TO LANGUISH IN HOSPITALS FOR HOURS ON END. OF MY PERSONAL RECORD THAT I AM AWARE OF FROM LAST WINTER. WE HAD TO PATIENTS AT ONE FACILITY WHO. THE CARE WAS NOT TRANSITION FOR TWENTY FIVE HOURS. I ALSO VISIT HOSPITALS IN MY ROLE AS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND HAVE WITNESSED THIS FIRST HAND HOW AMBULANCES ARE HELD UP WELL CALLS CONTINUE TO GO OUT WITH NO AMBULANCE TO SEND COMMUNITY RESOURCE FOR YEARS HOSPITALS HAVE TREATED BILLSAS AS AN UNLIMITED RESOURCE. AND ALLOW THEM TO WAIT FOR THESE HOURS AND OVERTIME IT'S GOTTEN OF COURSE PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. BUT EMS SYSTEM ALWAYS MANAGED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SPITE OF THE WALL TIME ISSUES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE FIRE SERVICE AND M. S. DO. THEY SOLVE PROBLEMS AND THEY MANAGED TO HOLD THAT SAFETY NET TOGETHER. BUT NOW WITH ANOTHER CALL THAT SEARCH LARGE NUMBERS OF THE EMERSON HOSPITAL WORKFORCE ARE OUT SICK WITH COLD IT. AND THE SURGEON EMS CALLS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS IS UPON US WE FIND OURSELVES AT A CRISIS POINT. EVERY DAY EMS SYSTEMS ACROSS OUR STATE OR FIND THEMSELVES COMPLETELY OUT OF AVAILABLE AMBULANCES TO SEND THE CALLS. BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING COMPLETELY CONSUMED AT THE HOSPITALS. SO WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO MITIGATE. IN RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS THE EMS SYSTEM HAS RESORTED TO A NUMBER OF MITIGATION MEASURES. WE HAVE SPECIALTY UNITS IN TELEMEDICINE PROGRAMS LAUNCHING WITH THE HOPE OF IDENTIFYING AND MANAGING LOW ACUITY PATIENTS WITHOUT SENDING THEM TO HOSPITALS. IT IS A BILL SINCE THIS WAS JUST MENTION IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OUR OUR DEPARTMENT ALSO APPLIED FOR A FEDERAL GRANT TO SET UP A NURSE TRIAGE LINE IN OUR DISPATCH THERE WAS A NOTICE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY THAT GOT REVOKED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. DESPITE LOTS OF AGENCIES LIKE OURS- APPLIED TO GET FUNDING TO DO JUST THAT. WE HAVE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE TEAMS ACROSS THE pAPPROPRIATE PATIENTS THE PSYCHIATRIC URGENT CARE CENTERS AND SOBERING CENTERS IN ORDER TO SAVE HOSPITAL CAPACITY. IN SPITE OF ALL THESE MEASURES WERE STILL HAVING CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WAITING ON SCENE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF AVAILABLE AMBULANCES. SO WE RESORTED TO TRANSPORTING THOSE PATIENTS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO GO OUT TO GET THEM TO THE HOSPITAL. WE TRANSPORTING CRITICAL PATIENTS AND FIRE ENGINES AND PARAMEDICS SQUADS LAW ENFORCEMENT PATROL VEHICLES. AND EVEN WE'LL CROSS A BUSY STREET FROM THE NURSING HOME TO THE HOSPITAL IN THEIR CAR FROM THE NURSING HOME. AT THE HOSPITALS WE CONSOLIDATED INSPECTIONS BY GETTING ONE ABLE TO SCREW TO WATCH MULTIPLE WAITING PATIENTS. SO THE OTHER CREWS CAN GO BACK INTO SERVICE AND PICK UP THE NEXT PATIENTS. AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN US IF WE DON'T START GETTING OUR AMBULANCES BACK EXPEDITIOUSLY. SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO. WE NEED TO ACT QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY TO STOP THE BLEEDING AND OUR EMS SYSTEM BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO YEARS IT'S A SLOW ROLLING DISASTER I UNDERSTAND BUT IT IS A DISASTER WE NEED TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY IF THERE WAS A PLANE CRASH IT WOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTABLE FOR A HOSPITAL TO HOLD UP A BILL SAYS AND LEAVE PATIENTS IN THE FLAMING WRECKAGE WAITING FOR TRANSPORT JUST BECAUSE THEY FELT OVERWHELMED. THE CULVERT SEARCHES BEEN NO LESS OF A DISASTER IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF A PLANE CRASH EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS IN MY COUNTY ALONE BUT EVERY DAY WE STILL HAVE CRITICAL PATIENTS WAITING FOR AN AMBULANCE AT THE SCENE OF THEIR EMERGENCY. IN TERMS OF ALL TIME THIS IS ONE AREA IN WHICH EXISTING LAWS VERY CLEAR. THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ACTIVE LABOR ACT AND TALA. HAS CLEARLY DEFINED THAT THE TRANSITION POINT IN PATIENT CARE RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN EMS AND HOSPITALS. IT IS AS SOON AS THAT PATIENT ARRIVES AT THE HOSPITAL AND THERE'S AWARENESS THAT THERE IS A PATIENT SEEKING THEIR SERVICES. DESPITE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AMBULANCES IN THIS SORT OF PERPETUAL STATE OF TRANSPORT. WHERE THEY'RE SITTING ON THE WALL BUT THE HOSPITAL'S REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. EXISTING LAWS ENFORCED IN HOSTELS WOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THEM TELL OBLIGATIONS. AND THEY'D BE FORCED TO STOP PRETENDING THAT THEY CAN STALL THESE OBLIGATIONS AND DEFINITELY. LONGER TERM TO MAKE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SYSTEMS MORE SUSTAINABLE BECAUSE OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT SUSTAINABLE WE NEED TO STOP SENDING ALL PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITAL FOR TRIAGE. WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO LOWER THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY TO HELP EMS ESTABLISH SYSTEMS TO IDENTIFY AND MANAGE LOW ACUITY PATIENTS WITHOUT FUNNELING EVERYTHING THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BOTTLENECK. IF WE CAN REDUCE OVER UTILIZATION THAT WE CAN SAVE CAPACITY FOR THE CRITICAL PATIENTS THE M. S. N. WORKS TO DEPARTMENT SYSTEMS WERE INTENDED TO SEARCH. WE ASK FOR YOUR COMMITTEES SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMS LIKE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS TELEMEDICINE AND OTHER INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR OUR NEXT WITNESSES DOCTOR PATEL OWNER THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA MARCH MEDICAL SEARCHES THIRTY EMS COMMISSIONER. COMMISSION DR OWNER ARE YOU THERE. I BELIEVE AND THERE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR. OKAY GREAT I APOLOGIZE IF I'M NOT ON CAMERA I DON'T KNOW THAT SO I HAVE SOME SOFTER PROBLEMS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DR GILLIAN ARE I AM A BOARD CERTIFIED EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA MUSCLE SORENESS COMMISSION ON PMS I'M A PROFESSOR OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE AND NURSING. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MERGING TWO DEPARTMENTS FULL TIME. FOR THE pIS A SYSTEM OF CARE OF THE DEPENDS ON HOSPITALS TAKING PATIENTS FROM EMS AMBULANCES PICK UP PATIENTS AND DELIVER THEM TO HOSPITALS. WE DO NOT HAVE A PATIENT. I'M BILLS PATIENT UPLOAD DELAY WE HAVE AND BILLS PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS THE HOSPITAL RECEIVING SIDE IS THE BOTTLENECK. M. THIS PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS ARE EIGHT OVER TWENTY YOUR PROBLEM HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH COBIT OR ANY SEARCH AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS HAPPEN EVERY DAY OF EVERY MONTH. OF EVERY YEAR. WILL WAS SO SEVERE THAT AND M. C. A. POT COMMITTEE ISSUED A HUNDRED TWENTY PAGE DOCUMENT ON HOW TO FIX IT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. PUBLISHED BY THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. BUT THE PROBLEM IS EVEN WORSE TODAY. OFTEN OVER HALF OF THE OUR BEDS ARE OCCUPIED BY PATIENTS WHO ARE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL IN SHOULD BE UPSTAIRS IN A HOSPITAL WARD. THIS INCREASES PATIENTS SUFFERING AND MORTALITY AND DECREASES PATIENT SATISFACTION. THE LIGHTS ARE NEVER OUT THESE PATIENTS GET NO REST. THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IS AN EIGHT CYLINDER ENGINE RUNNING ON FOUR CYLINDERS DUE TO THESE BLOCKED BEDS BUT IS STILL EXPECTED TO PULL ITS LOAN. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BEDS DEPEND ON HOSPITAL THROUGHPUT WHICH IS IN CONTROL OF THE HOSPITAL NOT EMS FOR THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THURMOND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS TO AMELIORATE THIS PROBLEM AND THEY ARE NOT BEING FOLLOWED IN THE HOSPITALS. M. AS PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS CREATE A HUMAN TOLL ON PATIENTS AND ON EMTS TO WAIT FOR OUR STANDING NOT SITTING IN HALLWAYS WITHOUT REST PERIODS. ISSUE SUFFERING ON SMALL STRUCTURES NOT DESIGNED FOR PROLONGED STAY THE NAY OF CARE INCLUDING NO PAIN MEDICATION NO ANTIBIOTICS NO PRIVACY AND NO DIGNITY. ATIONS WAITING IN THE WAITING ROOM FOR CARE FOR MANY HOURS THEN LEAVING WITHOUT BEING SEEN OR TREATED. THIS IS NEITHER SAFE NOR DIGNIFIED. ATIONS ALASKA'S RESPONSIBILITY AS SOON AS THE AMBULANCE ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL THIS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN THE TWENTY FOURTEEN A PART TOOL KIT. IT EVERYDAY I SEE PATIENTS ON AMBULANCE STRUCTURES LINING THE HALLWAYS WITH EMPTY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BEDS RIGHT NEXT TO THEM. THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SO LONG THAT HOSPITAL STAFF I THINK IT IS NORMAL THAT EMS PERSONNEL WATCH HOSPITAL PATIENTS ON PMS EQUIPMENT IN HOSPITAL HALLWAYS. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT CLINICAL OBSERVATION OF A PATIENT'S HEALTH STATUS REQUIRES MEDICAL JUDGMENT IT'S SORT REQUIRES MEDICAL EDUCATION. AND SO IT IS THE PRACTICE OF PARAMEDICINE OF NURSING AND OF MEDICINE. ANY DOCTOR OR NURSE WORKING IN A HOSPITAL HAD TO GO THROUGH A LENGTHY CREDENTIALING PROCESS TO ASSURE COMPETENCE. BUT EMS PERSONNEL ARE NOT CREDENTIALED TO PRACTICE MEDICINE ON HOSPITAL GROUNDS. THE OVER TWENTY YEAR PRACTICE OF EMS CONTINUING TO WATCH PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITAL VIOLATES THE HOSPITAL'S OWN CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS. HOSPITALS ARE IN CONTROL OF THEIR INTERNAL PROCEDURES AND THEY ARE FAILING. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ADMITTED WHICH MEANS THEY SENT 8290% HOME AFTER WORK UP WITH TREATMENT AND FOLLOW UP AS NEEDED. NO IN PATIENT BED REQUIRED. AS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN IF I HAVE ALL TEST RESULTS I NEED I CAN EITHER ADMIT OR DISCHARGE 80% OF MY PATIENTS ON THE SPOT. ONLY FEW NEED CLINICAL OBSERVATION OVERTIME IN THE E. R. TO FOR TREATMENT TO WORK. IT LAB AND IMAGING TURNAROUND TIMES ARE ATROCIOUS BECAUSE HOSPITAL PROCESSES ARE CONVOLUTED AND INEFFICIENT. HOSPITAL'S REPORT THE AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIMES ON THESE TEST. BUT THE PATIENT DOES NOT WAIT FOR THE AVERAGE JUST TO RETURN. THEY WAIT FOR THE LAST TEST TO RETURN IF I DID NOT NEED THAT LAST TEST I WOULDN'T HAVE ORDERED IT. HOSPITAL QUALITY METRICS DO NOT REFLECT THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE. PATIENT MDMS ARE SUFFERING FROM HOSPITALS FAILING TO GET THEIR MOST BASIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROCESS HE'S RIGHT. THEY ALSO SUBMITTED ALTERNATE DESTINATION IS VERY LIMITED IN EFFICACY BECAUSE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE FAR BETTER EQUIPPED TO HANDLE A VARIETY OF UNSCHEDULED VISITS AND ESCALATE OR DEESCALATE CARE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. WE HAVE SPENT FORTY YEARS CREATING BOTH THE MEDICAL AND NURSING SPECIALTY CALLED EMERGENCY MEDICINE WHICH IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD THE COMPROMISED EMERGENCY CARE WITHOUT THE NEED TO TRANSPORT TO ANOTHER FACILITY. ALTERNATIVES TO NATIONS SUCH AS CLINICS TO NOT HAVE A MEDICAL OR NURSING EXPERTISE TO DO SO AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT. MANY ALTERNATE DESTINATION PROJECT TO FAILED FOR THIS REASON. ALTERNATIVES TO NATION MAY BE COULD CARE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT SAY A PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT BUT IT WILL NOT SOLVE THE WIDESPREAD A PUMP PROBLEM. NO IT TO THE PATIENTS ARE IN THE WAITING ROOM AND DO NOT COMPETE FOR ER BEDS THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ALL TIMES IS LIMITED. SO WHAT ARE MY ASKS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND DIGNITY FOR THE PATIENT ONYEMA STRUCTURES AND FOR THE COMMUNITY WHO DIALS NINE ONE ONE AND GETS A DELAYED PMS RESPONSE. WE NEED TO THINK INSIDE THE BOX NOT OUTSIDE THE BOX. WE NEED IMPROVED HOSPITAL PROCESSES FOR BASIC DAILY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SERVICES LAB IMAGING STAFFING AND MEDICAL TREATMENTS SUCH AS HEMODIALYSIS. IF I'LL HAVE TO WORK WITH THIS FOUR CYLINDERS AT LEAST THOSE NEED TO RUN SMOOTHLY. M. AS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ARE PAYING FINES FOR FAILING TO MEET NINE ONE ONE RESPONSE TIMES BECAUSE OUR EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL ARE HELD HOSTAGE IN HOSPITALS. HOSPITALS ALSO NEED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FAILING TO MEET A PART TIME. AND LASTLY MAY BE MORE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE CALIFORNIA CAME OUT YEAH COBIT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS HAVE. TAUGHT US THE PARAMEDICS AND EMTS CAN BE VALUABLE EMPLOYEES AND HOSPITALS. AND THAT RIGID NURSE PATIENT RATIOS CAN BE NIELSEN SAFELY TO TAKE CARE OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENTS. THE CURRENT RATIO FOR TO ONE IS CONDEMNING COLLEGE EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS TO DO TASKS SUCH AS COPYING PATIENT MEDICATIONS. FROM A PROBLEM BY THE PATIENT A PLASTIC BACK INTO THE COMPUTER FOR MEASURING URINE VOLUMES. THESE NURSES COLLEGE EDUCATED PROFESSIONAL SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO DO GET TASKS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE AN ADVANCED DEGREE TELL ME ANSWER TECHNICAL PERSONNEL AND DO WHAT THEY'RE TRAINED TO DO. WHICH IS PROVIDE ADVANCEDMEDICAL ASSESSMENTS AND CARE. WE WOULD NEED BOTH OF THESE MEASURES TO BE MADE PERMANENT. VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OUR NEXT WITNESS IS DR LORRIE MORGAN WHO IS THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT HUNTINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL- DOCTOR MORGAN. GOOD MORNING. THREE THE MORNING AND IT HURTS THANK YOU CHAIR RODRIGUEZ ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND COLLEAGUES STAFF FOR BEING HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I'M INTERESTED- DOCTOR LORI MORGAN PRESIDENT AND CEO OF HUNTINGTON HEALTH AND PASADENA I WAS INVITED TO- HERE TO SPEAK TODAY AS A SEAT YOU KNOW BUT LET ME ASSURE YOU MY MOTIVATION FOR BEING HERE IS THAT I'M ACTUALLY A TRAUMA SURGEON- I RARELY SAW PATIENT WHEN PRACTICING CLINICALLY THAT WASN'T BROUGHT TO ME- FINANCE BILLIONS AND I KNOW IN A VERY UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WAY HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE IS AND HOW CRITICAL IT IS. THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS WHAT IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF EMS TO OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK IT IS- I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS COMPLEX AND I THINK THAT MANY FOLKS HAVE- I'VE TALKED ABOUT VERY SINGULAR SORT OF ISSUES FROM FROM ONE PERSPECTIVE AND HOPEFULLY I CAN ABROAD IN THAT A LITTLE BIT ACROSS THE CONTINUUM CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY SERVICES SYSTEM IS REALLY MADE UP OF CAN'T HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AMBULANCE FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IT SAID THE EPICENTER OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND IS INSEPARABLY LINKED TO PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY- OR- PUBLIC AND PUBLIC. SINCE TO SEE NINE CARE. OF TWENTY SEVEN. THREE SIXTY. THE M. SYSTEM STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS MUST BE AVAILABLE TO ALL WITHOUT RESTRICTION OR CONSIDERATION OF ABILITY TO PAY HOWEVER EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE LIMITED RESOURCE AND WHEN STRETCHED BEYOND CAPACITY AS WE HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. I CAN RESULT IN REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF EMS UNITS LONG RESPONSE TIMES PROVIDER STRESSED AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE COMBINED RESOURCES WHEN PATIENTS EITHER INSURED OR NOT CAN GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES DO YOU ACCESS OR FOR CONVENIENCE THEY REGULATE TURNED TO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. SOME OF THE REASONS INCLUDING A LACK OF PRIMARY CARE THE NEED FOR OBSERVATION PROCEDURAL ISSUES SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT BRINGING INDIVIDUALS FOR MEDICAL SCREENING EVALUATION OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH NEEDS EMPLOYEE HEALTH NEEDS. WHO NEED A CLEARANCE OR PHYSICAL FOR EMPLOYMENT SAFETY NET HEALTH CARE BEHAVIORAL CARE AND HAVE TO TELL YOU I WILL UNDERLINE THAT FOUR HUNDRED TIMES. HOMELESSNESS SUPPORT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND COVER NINETEEN OTHER COMING FOR TESTING AND OR VACCINES AND BUT FOR BOTH. EMERGENT AND NON EMERGENT CARE AS A RESULT OVERCROWDING HAS BECOME A COMMON OCCURRENCE ESPECIALLY AS THE OMICRON SURGE THAT HAS CRUSHED THE HOSPITAL'S. CONSIDER THAT THE GREATEST INCREASE IN ET VOLUME ARE THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL WOULD BE CARED FOR AN ALTERNATE HEALTHCARE SETTINGS AS MANY HAVE POINTED OUT. FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN PRIOR TO COPE AND NON URGENT P. D. VOLUME INCREASED CATIONS INCREASED. WHO NEEDED TO BE AMENDED INCREASE ONLY NINE PERCENT. AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND HUNTINGTON OVER 50% OF THE EMS CALLS WERE TRIAGED AND EMERGENCY SEVERITY INDEX SCORES OF THREE TO FIVE. WHICH ARE LOWER QD SCORE USUALLY THAT DO NOT NEED TO BE INVENTED AND IN GENERAL FUND URGENT AND THESE WERE PATIENTS THAT WERE BEING TRANSPORTED. NOT WALKING INTO OUR E. R. HEY GIRL HOW CARE PER. HAS A LARGE SPIKE WITH THE DIVAS FOR SO HARM INCREASE OVER 5% BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. AT THE SAME TIME THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT USES INCREASING THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER PATIENTS ARE THE HOSPITAL IS CONSTANTLY CHALLENGED BY NUMEROUS BARRIERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITALS CONTROL AND CAN TIE UP CAPACITY AND LIMIT INDIAN MISSIONS AND DECOMPRESSION. THEY INCLUDE A LACK OF POST ACUTE CARE BEDS INSURANCE AUTHORIZATION DECISIONS THAT DELAYED DISCHARGE ESPECIALLY FOR OUT OF NETWORK PLACEMENT DELAYS WERE TIMELY TRANSFER AUTHORIZATION. OXYGEN WALKERS WHEELCHAIRS AND OTHER DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT HOME HEALTH AND TRANSPORTATION. LACK OF DESPERATELY NEEDED HOMELESS SERVICES FIRST OF ALL I LIKE HOMELESS SERVICES REPORTING GETTING HUNDRED REFERRALS AND A DAY FOR HOMELESS COBIT ISOLATION FENCE WHEN ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE TOTAL BEDS ARE AVAILABLE. THERE IS A LACK OF MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC MONITORING PLACEMENT RESOURCES FOR HOMELESS. SERVING YOUR REHAB HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND THE DISABLED AND THEIR MINIMAL RESOURCES FOR THOSE IN NEED OF COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. CURRENT CHALLENGES WITH CODE FOR ISOLATION NEEDS AND THE ABILITY AND ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND ASSISTED LIVING GROUP HOMES OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT WILL ACCEPT TRANSFERS JUST TO GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT OF TODAY WHEN I WALKED IN THIS MORNING AT SEVEN I LOOKED AT OUR CURRENT NUMBERS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE EIGHTEEN PATIENTS THAT WE ARE UNABLE THAT ARE READY CLINICALLY TO BE DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL WE'RE UNABLE TO DISCHARGE THEM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORIZATIONS FOR INSURANCE PURPOSES. OR WE HAVE NO PLACE TO SEND THESE PATIENTS LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT SO THAT'S UP STAIRS WE'VE GOT EIGHTEEN BEDS WE COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT OUR EMERGENCY ROOM THIS MORNING. WE HAVE EIGHT CATIONS THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING THAT WE NOW NEED TO BE AMENDED AND THEY'RE HOLDING THEM WE HAVE ANOTHER FIFTEEN PATIENTS THAT. ARE PENDING A PROBABLE AND MISSION THIS DECISION. THAT'S TWENTY TO PAY THAT WE NEED BE IN MAY. I'VE GOT EIGHTEEN THAT I CAN JUST. AT AND WE KNOW WE HAVE LET'S FACE IT WE KNOW WE HAVE AMBULANCES THAT ARE WAITING TO GET AND I COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY. I COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE TWENTY TWO BEDS AVAILABLE TO THOSE AMBULANCES IF ONLY I COULD GET PATIENTS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL TO BE ADMITTED. THAT'S A VERY REAL TIME NUMBER FROM TODAY AND IT IS NOT ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER DAY TO BE QUITE HONEST. OUR CURRENT EFFORTS WE AGREE ARE NOT ENOUGH. EIGHTY OVERCROWDING AND THE ABILITY TO DISCHARGE PATIENTS ARE LEADING TO SOME. TO MANY OF THE AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS THAT WERE SAYING WE KNOW IT'S NOT A NEW PROBLEM WE KNOW THAT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND MS TO CONVENE. A COLLABORATIVE WE ALL TALKED ABOUT THE TOOL KIT THAT CAME OUT OF THE- STATE WHAT OTHER STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN SINCE THEN TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE DELAYS. YOU KNOW THEY THEY INCLUDE THE TOOL BECAUSE THEY INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE PILOT PROJECT LOOKING FOR ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS WITH AND THE COMMUNITY THAT PROJECTS ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL. GETTING THE PATIENT TO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME UNFORTUNATELY TWO OF THE KEY COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE PROGRAMS ALTERNATE NATION TO URGENT CARE AND PARAMEDIC READMISSION HOME VISITS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR. THE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE BELT. STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL TO ADDRESS EIGHTY ISSUES AND ASSIST IN THE DECREASE OF E. D. USAGE. I WHICH INCLUDED EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION NURSE SYSTEM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED BY SAMPOERNA DINO COLLABORATIVE THE SUCCESSFUL ALTERNATE DESTINATION SOBERING CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SUCCESS WITH THE ALTERNATE. DESTINATION FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISES SERVICES AND FRESNO. THESE ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE AND AS INDEPENDENT- EFFORTS WHAT'S REALLY NEEDED HONESTLY WE NEED BETTER DATA AND THAT WOULD REALLY PROBABLY PART OF THE. KEY TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM THE KERR- SYSTEM. PATIENT OFFLOAD TO TRACK IS GRIM INCREMENTS TO DRESSED DELAY WHAT WE NEED ARE OBJECT AND WE- REAL TIME DATA. MANY HOSPITALS EMBRACED NEW TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE THEIR INTERNAL DATA COLLECTION AND ARE IMPLEMENTING INNOVATION BASED ON HIS IMPROVEMENT BUT THE DATA ISN'T THERE FROM THE EMMA STANDPOINT. WE NEED TO GET A TO HELP US IDENTIFY THE GAPS AND COMMUNITY SERVICES WHICH WE ARE ENDING U TRYING TO PROVIDE NOT VERY WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT WE DO. TO PATIENTS SEEKING KNOWN AS AN EMERGENCY ROOM THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. MUST ALSO BE FACTORED INTO THE COST OF EIGHTY OVERCROWDING AND AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS. INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND DECREASE IT COMMUNITY SERVICES ARE A FEW EXAMPLES THAT PLAY OUT DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON. WHAT IS AVAILABLE AND VARIOUS COMMUNITIES. STATE CHAMPION SYSTEM WIDE BY AND AN ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO THE STATE TO INVEST IN LONG TERM QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESSES WILL ALSO BE THE NECESSARY. CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH EMSA AND THE NEWLY CREATED AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD LET COMMITTEE TO REINFORCE THE DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED AND THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND SOLUTIONS THERE IS NOT A SILVER BULLET IN AS THE I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE MULTIPLE. EFFORTS AND MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS TO SOLVE THIS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A HOSPITAL'S PERSPECTIVE ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE C. H. CHANGE REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS- STAND READY AND WILLING TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO IMPROVE OUR ECONOMIST SERVICES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND I'M HAPPY. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS WHEN IT'S TIME. THE YOU DR MORGAN OR NEXT WITNESS IS DR LARRY STOCK IS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS- DOCTOR STOCK ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YES I AM MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TO THIS COMMITTEE ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. YEAH THANK YOU. AS A FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS. I WANT TO SAY THAT EVEN AFTER THIRTY YEARS I LOVE BEING AN EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN. I LOVE IT MOSTLY BECAUSE I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY EVERY DAY TO HELP ANYONE WHO COMES FOR HELP FOR ANY REASON AT ANY TIME THE FEELS OR HAVE AN EMERGENCY. BUT IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS ALONE I PART OF THE OUR TEAM WITH OTHER PARTS YOU DOCTORS PA INCIDENT HE'S NURSES. TECHNICIANS THERAPISTS AND OTHERS. IN YOUR TEAM WORKS AS A UNIT WITHIN THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. THAT'S POSSIBLE SYSTEM REQUIRES CAPACITY AND THROUGHPUT TO ADEQUATELY CARE FOR THE CURRENT AND ARRIVING PATIENTS. WHAT HOSPITAL CONDITIONS RESULT IN ADMITTED PATIENTS BEING HELD IN THE ER IT CREATES OVERCROWDING WHICH BACKS UP INTO THE WAITING ROOM AND EVEN THE ADULTS PLAY IN THE ER FOR EMS. I FIND MYSELF FEELING STUCK IN THE MIDDLE. IT WAS PATIENT OFFLOAD TIME DELAYS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO HOSPITAL OVERCROWDING AND LACK OF NURSING CARE CAPACITY. WHICH IMPACTS ON THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND WAS SECOND IMPACTS ON PATIENTS ARRIVING BY AMBULANCE AND EMS TEAMS BRING IN THESE PATIENTS. FOR CARE. THE CODEPENDENT BECAUSE HIGHLIGHTED THROUGH HEALTH CARE WORKERS TOLD US IN ATTRITION AND A SURGEON PATIENT DEMAND. POSSIBLE CRAFTING AND THERE SHOULD CARE CAPACITY ISSUES THE PRE EXISTING CODE. YOUR PET'S FULFILLMENT OF PATIENTS AWAITING MOVEMENT TO INPATIENT POSSIBLE UNITS ALREADY AT CAPACITY RESULTANT ALREADY AND WAITING ROOM CARE FOR NEW RIDING A NEW ARRIVALS AN AMBULANCE. THE AMBULANCE WAS HOLDING THE WALLS WITH THEIR PATIENTS WELL THE MOST CRITICAL PATIENTS GET IMMEDIATE ATTENTION THOUGH SLIGHTLY LESS ACUTE MAY EXPERIENCE UNPLEASANT AND SOMETIMES DANGEROUS DELAYS. WHILE EMERGENCY MEDICINE DOCTOR WILL EVALUATE THE STATION'S EARLY AFTER RIVAL THEY NEED A REGISTERED NURSE TO CARRY OUT THE ORDERS FOR PATIENT MONITORING. TESTING MEDICATIONS IVIES AND OTHER CREEK. PULL BACK SHE- ADULT CASH FLOW TIME. IS A SALT PROBLEM. THE NEEDS WHY OUTSIDE OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FIRST HOSP OVER RECOVERY IS A FLETCHER BILL WRITTEN BY THE ASSEMBLY TED LIEU AB NOT ALLOWED AND TO NINE THE WHATEVER EACH ACUTE WHO. TO REGULARLY MEASURE A HOSPITAL CROWDING AND HAVE A HOST SURGED. THE MEASURE OVERCROWDING AND COMPANIONS PLAN COULD TRIGGER MEANINGFUL ACTIONS BY INCREASING CAPACITY AND BETTER MANAGING THROUGHPUT THESE TOOLS WOULD ASSIST HOSPITALS TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS TO UNCLOG THROUGHPUT. WE ARE IN A TIME OF CRISIS AND EVERYONE CANNOT CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL THE CHOICE IS LEFT ON THE TABLE ARE PAINFUL BUT THE DELAYS IN PATIENT CARE ARE REAL. AND WHILE TIME IS BUT ONE SYMPTOM OF THIS PROBLEM POSSIBLES NEED TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT WAYS TO CREATE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY SECOND STREET TARGETED REGULATORY RELAXATION COULD HELP ENHANCE NURSING CARE CAPACITY WHEN SERGE PLAN ACTIONS. FAILED TO ADEQUATELY MEET PATIENT NEEDS. THE GROWTH THE PATIENT ALL. IN CALIFORNIA SB THREE NINETY FOUR. NINETY NINETEEN WAS MEANT TO NOT HURT PATIENTS I WAS NEVER MEANT TO LEAD TO DELAYS IN CARE. HOWEVER IN TIMES OF NURSE. CARE CAPACITY SHORTAGES AND HIGH PATIENT DEMAND THIS IS EXACTLY WORKERS. EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS MERCY PHYSICIANS DO NOT HAVE RATIOS. IN ADDITION TO TARGETED FLEXIBILITY ANDOR STATION RACHELS OTHER REGULATORY RELAXATION COULD BE HELPFUL RELAXATION OF NURSING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS DURING HIGH DEMAND LOW CAPACITY TIMES. TO PREVENT MORE FOCUS ON ACTUAL CARE INPATIENT THE BAND REQUIRES IT THIS IS ALREADY COMMITTED DURING DISASTER MANAGEMENT AND MASS CASUALTY INCIDENTS. RELAXATION ON PERMITTING PARAMEDICS AND EMTS TO WORK UP TO THEIR EMS FIELD SCOPE WITH INDICATOR HOSPITALS UNDER OUR AND TO PROVIDE CARE TEAMS WHO HAS NURSING CARE CAPACITY COULD ALSO HELP. SEVERAL OF THESE SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY UTILIZING CALIFORNIA THE STATE PROVIDE REGULATORY RELIEF IN TWENTY TWENTY GET NOW WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE WORST CREDIT WE OF EXPERIENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND THESE RELIEF VALVES NO LONGER ARE IN PLACE. ALLEVIATING APPLICATION AWFUL TIME DELAYS WOULD PROTECT ELIMINATION CARE DELAYS FOR NEW ARRIVING AMBULANCE PATIENTS AND THE RETURN OF THE AMOUNTS TO THE FIELD THREE READY FOR THE NEXT RESIDENTS. WILL HAVE AN EMERGENCY I NEED HELP. EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM FROM THE STATE DOWN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE WORKER NEEDS TO DO THEIR PART TO HELP SOLVE THE OVERCROWDING. AND STAFFING PROBLEMS THEY'RE EXPERT. WE ARE EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO DELIVER SAFER MORE. TIMELY PATIENT CARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DAHLE. OUR NEXT. IS MISS CASE DONNA. WHO IS THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR. FOR HEALTH CARE EQUITY AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF DENIM ARE YOU AVAILABLE. I AM HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLY TO- AS MENTIONED I'M NOT A SIT DOWN AMEND THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY. AT A COMPANY ARTICLE ABOUT. TO ECHO OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS THE ONES LONGSTANDING CRITIC. BUT A COMPLEX ISSUE THAT DEMANDS A ROBUST SOLUTION WE RECOGNIZE LIKE OTHERS THAT THIS ISSUE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY. THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. I'M HERE TO PROVIDE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF CURRENT INITIATIVES UNDERWAY TO ADDRESS THIS. AMBULANCE IS AN AWFUL TIME DELAYS. WORK FOR SURE EFFORTS DURING AND- MEDICAL SERVICE SYSTEM. IN RESPONSE TO THE EXCEPTIONAL DEMAND ON HOSPITALS. BERMAN HAS WAIVED SOME LICENSING REQUIREMENTS TO ALLOW HOSPITALS TO EXPAND INPATIENT SPACE AND CAPACITY FOR EXAMPLE THIS REMOVED THE NEED FOR HOSPITALS TO SEEK APPROVAL TO ERECT EMERGENCY TENTS AND INSTEAD EXPEDITIOUSLY RE OPEN. INTERACTIVE SPACES AND CONVERT. I TO SPEND TRIAGE AN INPATIENT CAPACITY THUS RID US REDUCING. THE SIMPSONS WAITING FOR ADMISSION TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED MANDATORY. FOR LEVEL LEARNING TO OTHER HOSPITALS TO REAP IT LEAVE OVERBURDENED HOSPITALS IS REQUIRES A HOSPITAL OR THE REGION THANKS. A TOTAL I SEE YOU CAPACITY OF LESS THAN 10% OR MORE FOR THREE CAN. THANK AND- WHAT'S IN THE HOSPITAL BURDEN THROUGHOUT FACILITIES IN THAT REGION. THE CURRENTLY IF THERE'S NO I SEEK I SEE YOU CAPACITY THAT REGION ARE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES THIRTY MAY DIRECT AT STATEWIDE REDISTRIBUTION AND TRANSFER PATIENTS AND SHIP WITH A REGIONAL DISASTER MEDICAL HEALTH SPECIALIST ARGUMENT JUST. CURRENTLY NO REGIONS ARE UNDER THAT MANDATORY TRANSFER GUIDELINES. AS I SEE CAPACITY AS OF YESTERDAY REMAINS ABOUT THAT MONITOR THAT DATA ON A DAILY BASIS. WE'VE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN COURTNEY ANY ASSET EITHER DEPLOYMENT OF STAFF RESOURCES TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO ASSIST WITH YOUR CLIENTS AND DISCHARGES FROM HOSPITALS. ONGOING EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO FURTHER INCREASE BED CAPACITY THROUGHOUT. THE STATE NOT WITH REGARD TO DEPLOYMENT OF DIRECT CARE STAFF IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON- THROUGH STATE CONTRACTS. HOLD ON WITH VARIOUS STAFF REGISTRY ORGANIZATIONS NATIONWIDE. ALSO IN PARTNERSHIP AMAZON- WE HAVE DEPLOYED ARE AND OTHER CAREER RESOURCE. DIRECTLY TO HOSPITALS. IS EFFORTS AIMED AT AUGMENTING EXISTING STAFF RESOURCES AND INCREASING CAPACITY. TO READ THE SUBJECT OBJECTIVES- WE HAVE ALL RAISED ABOUT A STATE STAFF RESOURCES TO ALSO BE ABLE TO WORK IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT WE RECOGNIZED- THE VACCINES CONTINUE TO PROTECT AGAINST SERIOUS ILLNESS HOSPITAL ARE REACHING CAPACITY AND STAFF SHORTAGES ARE REAL MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO TREAT THOSE IN NEED CENTRAL KERR- WE HAVE AUTHORIZED HOSPITALS TO IMPLEMENT THE USE OF A TEAM PERSON MODEL. OF THAT MODEL BRINGS TOGETHER LICENSE NURSES WITH DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND SKILLS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS IT SUPPORTS THE MATCHING OF NURSES AND THEIR CARE TASKS TO THE MOST APPROPRIATE NURSE FOR A GROUP OF PATIENTS RATHER THAN HAVING ONE NURSE PERFORMED ALL CARE TASKS PERPENDICULAR PATIENT FOR EXAMPLE AND I SEE YOU HAVING TWELVE PATIENTS MAY ASSIGN THOSE TWELVE PATIENTS TO OUR NURSING TEAM CONSISTING OF. BOTH DO YOU EXPERIENCE NURSES AS WELL AS MEN SEARCHER SIMILARLY. EXPERIENCED NURSES. THE I. C. U. NURSES WILL FOR THE GROUP OF PATIENTS AND THEN THE MED SURGE OR SIMILARLY EXPERIENCES WILL PERFORM THE NURSING CARE TASK THAT THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE. FOR THE GROUP OF THE PATIENTS ALTHOUGH THIS DOES NOT CHANGE BINNER SUFFICIENT RATIO WAIVERS IT DOES ALLOW THE HOSPITAL TO LEVERAGE EXISTING RESOURCES TO CARE FOR COMPLEX PATIENTS. ITERATIVE WAY NURSING FACILITIES TO ALLOW A SYMPTOMATIC BOSTON. THE POSITIVE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO RETURN TO WORK- WITHOUT REQUIRING A NEGATIVE TEST HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE- THANK AND ARE A SYMPTOMATIC MAY RETURN TO WORK NEXT I JUST ON THE OTHER LINE MAY. NOT RETURN TO WORK IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT ISOLATION WITHOUT TESTING- AND THAT DATE DOES A SYMPTOMATIC PERSONNEL CAN CARE FOR. ALSO CAMPING OUT PATIENTS AREN'T THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR- IN- IN NINETY FIVE RESPECT RESPIRATORS FOR CONTROL I'M IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE EXPOSURE- BUT AGAIN OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE OTHER PERSON I WORK WITH A POSITIVE. PATIENTS THE IF THE ADDITIONAL OVER THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS IS TO LOOK AT WAYS TO- BRING IN ADDITIONAL STAFF- IN. YOUR RESTORE- NECESSARY STAFFING THERE. REALLY THE BURDEN ON HOSPITALS AND CERTAINLY PROVIDE ESSENTIAL CARE TO STOP. AND WE HAVE ALSO WORKED- TO WAIVE. TRAINING AND RECERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS TEMPORARILY FOR VARIOUS PROFESSIONALS INCLUDING CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS- WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION THERE MANDATORY CONTINUING EDUCATION OVER THE TIME PERIOD DURING THE PANDEMIC- I GET INTO TRYING TO SUPPORT. THE ONGOING CARE THAT'S BEING PROVIDED IN VARIOUS SETTINGS I'M WE HAVE IT IN ADDITION AUTHORIZED A HOSPITAL AT HOME PROGRAM TO CREATE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR HOSPITALS IS ALLOWED HOSPITALS PROVIDE CARE TO THEIR PATIENTS- WITHIN THE HOME TO ALLEVIATE SEARCH CONDITIONS OF HOSPITALS FOR PATIENTS- THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. PARTICULAR FOR- WE HAVE ADDITIONALLY GRANTED WAIVERS FOR HOURS OF OPERATION ON FOR CLINICS ON THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY LIMITED- THIS ALLOWS ACCESS TO CARE OUTSIDE OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT- AND ALTERNATIVES FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE PRESENTING FOR LOWER LEVEL. LOWER LEVEL HEALTHCARE NEEDS. AND THEN OF COURSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- AUTHORIZING EXPANDED USE OF SPRINGS- WHETHER IT BE TEMPORARY CONVERSION OF SACE AND HOSPITALS ARE INCLUDING- TENTS- USE AN OTHER OPTIONS. AB TESTING ARE. ONE OF ANTIBODIES TRIAGE AND OTHER SOURCES FOR HOSPITALS TO CARE. I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR ALL HEALTHCARE WORKERS ACROSS IRAQ CALIFORNIA BOTH PRE HOSPITAL IN HOSPITAL BECAUSE HOSPITALS ARE FOR THEIR TIRELESS WORK THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC I THINK THAT WE ARE TOGETHER I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE A POP COMMITTEE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO RESOLUTION CONSERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS. MY TO. THANK AT THE DIRECTOR OUR NEXT WITNESSES NURSE VICKY BERMUDEZ WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION- VICKI ARE YOU THERE. YES GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBERS SAY ARE CHAU AND MEMBERS OF THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION OR NATIONAL NURSES UNITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING ON AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS A PODS. IT'S NEARLY TWO YEARS SINCE COVERING ISSUED THE PROCLAMATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY SINCE THAT TIME THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HAS BEEN UNDER THE STRICT OF THE CUPBOARD AND DEMOCRATS HIS. WAIST OF NEED SERVICES EIGHT THE OF HIS HEARING IS BUT ONE SIMPLE THAT STRESS SEEN IS FOCUSED ITS EFFORTS TO REDUCE A PROJECT'S IN PROTECT PATIENTS BY PRESERVING THE R. AND WORKFORCE IT ASSUMES CARE FROM EMS AMBULANCE PERSONNEL AND PROVIDE CARE IN BOTH THE EDT IN THE INPATIENT SETTING WE HAVE TAKEN A MULTI MEASURE. CLUED FORSMAN OF MEN. HUNDREDS REQUIREMENTS SUPPLIES OF SINGLE USE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ENHANCED CONTROL PROCEDURES PROPER ISOLATION QUARANTINING AND TESTING OF CODE POSITIVE EXPOSED STAFF. IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING MANDATED STAFFING STANDARDS WAS EVIDENCED IN THE STUDY FROM UC SAN DIEGO DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE PUBLISHED IN TWENTY TEN. IT CONCLUDED THAT THROUGHPUT MEASURES PATIENT WAIT TIMES AND HE CARRIED TMES WERE SHORTER WHEN EATING OR STOPPING WERE WITHIN THE STATE MANDATED LEVELS AFTER CONTROLLING FOR EDIE CENSUS AND PATIENT ACUITY. EMERGENCY MEDICINE PRACTICE COMMITTEE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS REPORTED THESE FINDINGS IN THIS MAY TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CROWDING HIGH IMPACT SOLUTIONS IN FACT MINIMUM SAFE PATIENT STAFFING STANDARDS CONTRIBUTE EIGHTY EFFICIENCY THAT CAN REDUCE AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD TIMES EIGHT CARDS ARE A PROBLEM IN CANADA EUROPE AND IN MOST US STATES. NOT A PROBLEM UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA WERE MANDATED RATIOS PROTECT PATIENTS AND REDUCE OUR AND BURN OUT MORAL DISTRESS AND MORAL INJURY THE ASSERTION THAT MANDATED MINIMUM STAFFING RATIOS CONTRIBUTE TO A PART RESULTS FROM THIS IS JUST ARGUMENT. PLEASE POSSIBLE BUT BROUGHT. JUST BE THE LAST SEARCHING COVERED HOSPITAL AMONG CAL WAS ABLE TO FLATTEN THE CURVE WE HAD OUR IN MEMBERS WERELAID OFF BY HOSPITALS IN AREAS WERE ELECTIVE PROCEDURES WERE CANCELLED AND HOSPITALS AND- YOU NEVER SEE. A SURGE CO THE PATIENTS IN OTHER HOSPITALS CLOSED UNITS AND LAID OFF KOREANS. LACK OF CREATIVITY THAT HOSPITALS DEMONSTRATED BY LAYING OFF LICENSED OUR ENDS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SURGE WAS INEXCUSABLE. THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EDUCATION TORRANCE AND LOS ANGELES AREAS SO THAT THEY COULD BE READY TO PROVIDE CARE TO COVER THE PATIENTS. WHEN THE CENSUS INCREASE THAT DOWN TIME WAS WASTED AND HERE WE ARE NEARLY TWO YEARS LATER IS WHAT HOSPITALS AGAIN. EXTRA ADDRESS UNPREPARED TO RAPIDLY. THE HIRING OF STAFF TO MEET THE PRESIDENT NEED. CALIFORNIA NEEDS PRESERVE OUR NURSING WORKFORCE CONTINUOUSLY ADD NEW GRADUATE NURSES TO THE WORK FORCE AND PROTECT THE EXISTING AND NEW GRADUATE WORK FORCE ALL THE CNA FOCUSED EFFORTS. IT TWENTY TWENTY GERMAN NETWORK OPEN ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION SHOWED CALIFORNIA WITH A LOWER RATE OF NURSES WHO LEFT THEIR JOBS WITHOUT MINIMUM THINGS SUCH AS TEXAS FLORIDA NEW YORK AND NEVADA AT 372408% OF THEIR NURSES LEAVE THEIR JOB GOING TO BURN OUT WITH A STRESSFUL WORK ENVIRONMENT AND INADEQUATE STAFFING. BEING THE PRIME REASONS NURSES REPORTED. RIGHT NOW. A RECENT ARTICLE IN HEALTH CARE MANAGER STILL AN EPIDEMIC THE BURNOUT SYNDROME IN HOSPITAL REGISTERED NURSES FOUND THE BURNOUT RATES WERE HIGHER IN HOSPITALS WITH A HIGHER NUMBER OF PATIENTS TRAINERS. AND AMONG YOUNGER. IT IS SHORT SIGHTED TO THINK ADDING HOT UNSAFE LEVELS OF PATIENTS ON TO ART ASSIGNMENTS WILL REDUCE A POTS. WHAT HOSPITALS AND OTHERS LIKE TO REFER TO AS RATIO FLEXIBILITY IS EXACTLY THE WRONG THING TO DO IF WE ARE TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT THE ARMED WORKFORCE BY REDUCING BURNOUT. MORAL DISTRESS AND MORAL INJURY. COMPLIANCE WITH MANDATED RATIOS DECREASED PATIENT WAIT TIMES INCREASE ET THROUGHPUT AND PROVIDE THE SAFE PATIENT CARE THE CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPECT. DURING THE TWENTY CARRY THAT THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA. AND FOURTH FIVE HUNDRED NEW GRADUATE REGISTERED NURSES. HOWEVER WE CANNOT EXPECT TO ADDRESS OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE ARE AND WORKFORCE NEEDS INCLUDING ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF THE E. D. NURSES IF CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTS SHORTS LIFE'S SHORT SIGHTED EMERGENCY STRATEGIES THAT RESULT IN EXPERIENCED. AND NEWLY LICENSED NURSES LEAVING THE PROFESSION BECAUSE OF WILL BRING OUT MORAL DISTRESS AND MORAL INJURY FASTER THAN WE CAN REPLACE THEM. CNN WILL CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO IDEAS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REDUCE PARTS IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE PETITIONS OUR PARTICIPATION AS A MEMBER OF THE AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD TIMES ADVISORY COMMITTEE. FOR THE TWENTIETH YEAR IN A ROW NURSES WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST TRUSTED AND MOST ETHICAL PROFESSION. ARENDS WORKING CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS AND CLINICS WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR SAFE PATIENT CARE STANDARDS ARE HIGH STANDARDS FOR THE PROFESSION THAT HAVE EARNED THEM THE PUBLIC TRUST THANK YOU AND I'M READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU UNDERSTAND AS OUR FINAL WITNESS OF FOR TODAY'S HEARING IS NURSE GENDER NOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY NURSES ASSOCIATION. A NURSE DOWN ARE YOU THERE. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN- THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER RODRIGUEZ AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNY AND I AM AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT NURSE. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY NURSES ASSOCIATION AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS TOPIC TODAY I'VE BEEN A REGISTERED NURSE FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND PRIOR TO THAT I WAS AN EMT. THE CALIFORNIA EMERGED DISASSOCIATION AGREES WITH THE PRIOR SPEAKERS THAT AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAY IS A SYMPTOM OF A LARGER SYSTEM WIDE LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BUT IT'S NOT JUST SEEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTY OUR FIRE AND EMS PARTNERS FACE AS WE ARE RIGHT ALONGSIDE THEM IN OUR BUSY EDIE'S. EMERGENCY CARE IS ONE COMPONENT OF THE LARGER SYSTEM AND WHEN SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE ON THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IT IMPACTS THE ET. A PART IN CRAFTING ARE MULTI FACTORIAL PROBLEMS PLAGUING MANY COMMUNITIES. THE EMERGENCY IS ASSOCIATION AND ITS SIX THOUSAND MEMBER STRIVE EVERY DAY TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST QUALITY ET CARE TO PATIENTS PRESENTING IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. IN A MEMBERS WORK IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IT I'M SAYS AND IT'S GREAT CARE TREE. PURSES EACH ET NURSE WANTS TO OFFLOAD PATIENTS ARRIVING BY AMBULANCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER EACH NURSE ALSO HAVE TO BALANCE THE PATIENT LOAD AND ACUITY THAT HERE SHE IS ALREADY CARING FOR. WE KNOW THAT THE PATIENT WAITING HAS MEDICAL NEEDS BUT ALSO MIGHT BECOMING AGITATED. AT THE WAIT TIME WHICH INCREASES THE RISK OF VIOLENCE TO THE NURSE. HEALTHCARE VIOLENCE IS A PROBLEM EXACERBATED BY A PART. THE TIMES UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES TO SAFELY EXCEPT ONE MORE PATIENT. AND MY RESOURCES I MEAN STAFF BUT ALSO PHYSICALLY HAVE A BETTER GURNEY EMPTY AND AVAILABLE. DURING CO THAT WE HAVE EXPANDED INTO SPACES THAT ARE NOT MEANT FOR PATIENT CARE SUCH AS WAITING ROOMS LOBBIES INTENSE. EATING PURPOSES INSTEAD OF CARE FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH MANY PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE THE AB NURSE IN THE- WRITING SUPPORT TO AN OLDER THE WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND IS SIXTY FIVE YEARS JUST DIED IN THE E. D. ALONG WITH SOMEONE WHO IS BEING EVALUATED FOR PNEUMONIA AND HE NEEDS TO HAVE INTERESTS. AND POLITICS A SAP. AND A STROKE PATIENT WHO JUST ARRIVED WHO NEED IMMEDIATE KERR. DESPITE PATIENTS HAVING TO WAIT FOR A BED WE IS NURSES AND HOSPITALS HAVE TO MEET REGULATIONS FOR DISEASE TREATMENT TIME SUCH AS SEPSIS. WE ARE NOT REIMBURSED AT THE FULL RATE RATES WHEN WE MISS THESE TIMES. THE MISMATCH BETWEEN AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND THE NEED FOR EIGHTY SERVICES. CAN BE MORE PATIENTS THAN STAFF CAN CARE FOR OR MORE PATIENCE THAN TREATMENT BEDS IN EDIE. WHICH CAUSES CRAFTING. BUT THE MISMATCH ETWEEN HEALTH CARE RESOURCE AND COMMUNITY NEED GOES WELL BEYOND THE WALLS OF THE E. B. AB CROWDING AND THEREFORE A RELIANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD DELAYS CAUSED BY THE SYSTEMIC FAILURE OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE NEEDED HEALTH RESOURCES. ONE OF OUR MEMBERS RELATED TO ME A STORY ABOUT A PATIENT LIMPING INTO TRIAGE WITH A SPLINT ON HIS ANKLE AND X. RAYS. BROKEN HIS ANKLE THE PRIOR WEEK. THIS WEEK BUT WAS UNABLE GET AN ORTHOPEDIC THAT WOULD TAKE HIM. HE MEDICAL WITH EVERY POSSIBLE TYPE OF INSURANCE THAT HAVE PROBLEMS FINDING CARE. THESE PATIENTS THEN TURNED TO THE EP. BUT COMMON ENDPOINT IS THE EIGHTY BEDS ARE FULL INCLUDING ADMITTED PATIENTS AND EDIE CANNOT RETURNEES AND STAFF TO ACCEPT NEW PATIENTS. MANY EDIE'S HAVE USED THE C. H. A TOOL KIT MENTIONED HERE IN THIS HEARING TO IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO SEE AS MANY PATIENTS AS POSSIBLE. TYPICALLY 4260% EMERGENT. ARE WALKIN AND NON EMERGENT WE HAVE PIVOTED TO TREAT THESE PATIENTS THROUGH THE LOBBY WHERE WE ARE NOT COVERED UNDER NURSE RATIOS AND MIGHT BE SERVING UP TO FIFTY PATIENTS. IT'S RUMORED CONSIDER ALLOWED TO GO OUT OF REACH SO BRIEFLY IS A PLAN TO GET BACK INTO RATIO. BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH A PLAN DURING THE SEARCH TIMES. WE ARE ALSO COMMONLY HOLDING 25% OF OUR BEDS SOMETIMES MORE SOMETIMES LESS WITH BHAVIORAL PATIENTS WHO CANNOT GET TRANSFERRED OUT TO APPROPRIATE CARE. THESE PATIENTS HAVE TO BE IN A ROOM WITH THEIR VIOLENT SO IT TAKES A THE BEST FOR THAT I'M SO WITH ANOTHER PATIENT ARE ALSO HEARING- ARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS IN THEIR CRISIS TIME. EIGHTIES HAVE ALSO HIRED SOCIAL WORKERS CASE MANAGERS PSYCH RESPONSE TEAM SUBSTANCE USE NAVIGATORS AND OTHER ANCILLARY STAFF TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL PATIENTS TO SEEK CARE IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY CAN'T FIND IN THE COMMUNITY- WHEN. THESE CASES GET BACKED UP AGAIN THESE PATIENTS ARE TAKING UP BEDS. THE NURSES SEE PATIENTS EVERY DAY WHO CANNOT ACCESS HEALTH KERRY. IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND HAVE NO CHOICE BUT COME TO THE E. D. WE ARE THE LAST RESORT WITH A PATIENT WHO HAS NO CHOICE OR AVAILABLE. RESOURCES ENDS UP COMING. WE PROVIDE SPECIALTY CARE LIKE ORTHOPEDICS OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIALYSIS FOR PATIENTS WHO MISTER DALLAS'S AND CAN'T GET IN. PATIENTS CONSERVE DERIVING FOR COKE AT TESTING THIS CURRENT SURGE- EVEN OTHERS CAMPAIGNS TO ASK. PATIENTS NOT TO COME TO THE IN EACH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT- JUST FOR COVER TESTS. WE ARE CREDIT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN MOST TIMES. EXTORTED BAR IN STATION ON A DELAY. WE THAT WITHIN THE PAST TWENTY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCESS COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE NOW HAVING WORSENING AND UNTREATED HEALTH CARE PROBLEMS WE SEE THIS EVERY DAY WITH THE HIGH ACUITY OF OUR SICK PATIENTS IT'S ALSO TRUE FOR UNMET PATIENT NEEDS SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HOMELESS PATIENTS THOSE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS AND THOSE WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO CARE. AS EVERYONE MENTIONED TODAY WE DON'T WANT TO CONFOUND COATED WITH A POT THIS IS BEEN A LONG STANDING PROBLEM ASSOCIATION RECOGNIZES THE FOLLOWING SOLUTIONS THAT MAY RELIEVE AMBULANCE OFFLOAD DELAYS. THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR THIS ISSUE. EACH GEOGRAPHIC REGION HAS DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND ADDITIONALLY EACH ET IS DIFFERENT AS IS GIVE LOCAL EMS AGENCY AND INDIVIDUAL PRE HOSPITAL PROVIDERS SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE BEST WORKED OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE DESTINATIONS SUCH AS PROPOSED IN THE RECENT M. SOME REGULATIONS AND MAYBE FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR WE APPROPRIATELY ALLOW SOME PENSIONS WITH VIRGIN HEALTH CARE NEEDS TO BE TRANSPORTED TO OTHER FACILITIES WHERE THEY CAN GET THEIR NEEDS MET. THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE MONITORED AND EXTEND IT FOR OTHER USES. ONCE HE SAID HAD GREAT IDEAS SUCH AS ASSESSING REFER POLICIES. AND ALSO UTILIZING NURSES IN THEIR NINE ONE ONE SECONDS TO HELP TRIAGE PATIENTS WHO NEED EMERGENCY CARE VERSUS OTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES SOLVE THE PROBLEM THIS COST WILL GET SHIFTED TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ULTIMATELY THE GENERAL PUBLIC. MANY HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING TO RECOUP COSTS FROM THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND WITH STAFF HAVING THEIR OWN BURNOUT RATES NOW WE ARE HIRING TRAVELER NURSES AT VERY HIGH COST. SO THERE'S YOU KNOW UNLIMITED MONEY TO GO AROUND FOR ALL OF THESE ISSUES. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO HELP ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE WE STAND READY TO ASSIST THE COMMITTEE TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM. AND WORK TOGETHER WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU UP NURSE- DENTAL WILL BRING BACK NOW TO. COMMITTEE FOR A FOLLOW UP- OFFICE HE ONCE AGAIN I'M- ARE NOT GOING THROUGH MY MIND FROM ALL THE PRESENTATIONS WE'VE BEEN HAVING FROM THE FIRST PRODUCT UP TO NOW THE SECOND PANEL. ARE JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION FOR PROBABLY ANYBODY ON THE SECOND PANEL UNKNOWNS COUPLE PALACE WE TALKED ABOUT. THE DATA THESE COMMITTEES OF THESE BOARDS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO STUDY THIS ISSUE BUT- TO ME I THINK THE DATA IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT. THERE IS A PROBLEM I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE YEARS OF DATA OR HOW MANY MORE COMMITTEES OR BOARDS THAT NEED TO BE. CREATED TO LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S HERE IT'S BEEN HERE FOR DECADES- I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WHY WE NEED MORE DATA MORE INFORMATION- I HAVE LETTERS HERE FROM DEPARTMENTS. TELLING ME THAT THEY HAVE DATA GOING BACK DECADES. BUT YET THERE'S NOBODY SEEMS TO FIX THE SOLUTION OR WANT TO FIX THE SOLUTION. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE THAT. IF NOBODY WANTS TO MOVE IT THESE COMMITTEES THESE THESE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE HAVE THE STATE OF THEM. IT'S GOING TO BE OUR TURN AS LONG. TO COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS SOME LEGISLATION THAT FOLKS MAY NOT LAW. BUT I GUESS IT'S GOING TO AFTER FOR. SO THE NO ONE CHRISTOPHER ANYWAY ON ON THE SECOND WAS. HOW MUCH MORE DATA DO WE NEED WE ALREADY KNOW THE PROBLEMS HERE. EVERYBODY CAN HEAR THAT'S BEEN IN IN THE YEAH MASS. FIELD FOR YEARS CONTAR THIS GOING BACK DECADES THE PANDEMIC HAS JUST ELEVATED TO A NEW TO A NEW LEVEL BUT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO NOW LIKE I SAID. I DON'T WANT TO DO LEGISLATION. YOUR TUNING PROCESS I'M GONNA DO IS I'M A SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW THAT I CAN HOPEFULLY SEE WITHIN THE FEW WEEKS THAT WOULD START TO SEE SOME ELIMINATION OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING I MEAN IT'S THERE'S SO MUCH RIGHT. FROM THE CALL OF SERVICE FROM THE MY ONE CALL TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL HALF OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY MORE DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL WE TALK ABOUT THE TELLEMENT MOUNT. TELEMEDICINE COMMITTEE PERMISSIVE ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS BUT ONCE AGAIN THE DATA IS THERE SO CAN ANYBODY JUST ANSWER A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH MORE DATA AND WHY DO WE NEED TO WAIT FOR MORE DATA TO COME UP WITH PROBLEMS. AND WENT I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR WE CAN ALL AGREE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. THE GENERATOR USES A START UNIFIED NAME AS COMMISSIONER STARTED JUMPING BY THAT I'M- IN THE PANEL I'M- I'M NOT ON PALISADE CAN'T RAISE MY HAND. I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA WE KNOW IT'S AN URGENT PROBLEM WE HAD A TOOL KIT EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT IS A HUNDRED TWENTY VERBOSE PAGES THAT DIDN'T FIX ANYTHING I AGREE WITH THAT. KASICH ADJUSTER THE TOOL KITS WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WHAT I DO THINK IS THAT WE NEED TO THINK INSIDE THE BOX NOT OUTSIDE THE BOX LET'S NOT GET TOO FANCY WITH SOLUTIONS AND IMPROVE THE PROCESS. YOU HAVE. AGAIN IF WE CAN MAKE. AN E. R. AS EIGHT CYLINDER ENGINE RUNNING ON FOUR CYLINDERS BECAUSE- BEDS ARE OCCUPIED WITH PATIENTS THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THE YEAR THEY SHOULD BE UPSTAIRS. BUT IF I CAN TURN THOSE REMAINING BEDS FASTER IF I CAN GET MY TEST PAID BACK FASTER IF I CAN PER IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCIES WITH. IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. BLOOD DRAWS LABS X. RAYS WITH READS IF I CAN DOUBLE THAT SPEED I WILL DOUBLE THE SPEED WITH WHICH I TURN THOSE. BEDS 80% OF MY PATIENTS PLUS 85% ARE NOT BEING ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. BEING SENT HOME. WE NEED TO FIX THE EFFICIENCIES IN THE SYSTEM WE CURRENTLY HAVE. AND THEN WE CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT OTHER SOLUTIONS BUT I REALLY THINK THAT BE THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. THANK YOU SIR. CHARLES DICKENS A STARK AND MORGAN I THINK I MIGHT ANSWER THAT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND IT GOES BACK TO. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT OTHER FOLKS TESTIFIED TO ITS I THINK ALL UP. INTO ME WHEN I SAY MORE DATA I GUESS IT'S NOT MORE DATA TO PROVE THE ISSUE BECAUSE CERTAINLY THE ISSUE AS WELL PREVENT. I THINK IT'S MORE DATA. UNDERSTAND LOCALLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS- PERHAPS DOCTOR OWNERS. HOSPITAL AND I JUST HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF X. TEST OR Y. X. RAY. THAT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE ON A IN THE NEXT COUNTY OVER IN ON THE NEXT COUNTY OVER MAYBE THERE ABSOLUTELY. NO AVAILABILITY OF BEDS TO DISCHARGE PATIENTS TOO SO. I THINK THAT TO ME THAT MORE DATA QUESTION REALLY IS. A POP MAYBE NOT. MORE DATA BY DIFFERENT DATA WHICH IS PARKS AND THE DATA. FOR A OF THOSE LOCAL REGION AND LOOK AREA. WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING ARE GOING TO BE HELPFUL YOU KNOW IF SOME. ONE HOSPITAL RD HAS LAB TURNAROUND TIMES THAT ARE YOU KNOW IN THREE MINUTES OR LESS THAN FOCUSING ON LAND TURN AROUND TIMES FOR THAT HOSPITAL OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT BE USEFUL. SO I THINK WHEN I TALK ABOUT WE NEED SORT OF BETTER I WOULD SAY MAYBE THE ISSUE IS- MORE PARSED DATA. SO THAT WERE MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME BUTTONS- THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE OR AT DIFFERENT AREAS ADJOURNMENT JUST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WE DON'T NEED MORE DATA WE DO NEED TO FIX THE DATA BECAUSE- THAT'S GOING TO HELP US UNDERSTAND IF THE- THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING ARE IMPACTING THE PROBLEM SO I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON THE DATA. BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE. AN IMPEDANCE TO ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING TO TRY AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS ARGUING IF OUR WALL TIME IN SIXTY FIVE MINUTES. MINUTES DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF SIXTY FIVE MINUTES IS STILL UNACCEPTABLE. BUT WE STILL DO WANT TO SOLVE THE DATA PROBLEM. AND I WOULD JUST SAY AT THIS THIS I'M FOR AND AGAIN THIS IS. I UNDERSTAND THE HARMFUL SIDE OF THINGS BUT THAT THE STANCE HAS BEEN KIND OF FOR YEARS. THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE THE HOSPITAL PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THE M. S. PROBLEMS BUT- WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE NEED WE HAVE PAID. WITH HEART ATTACKS WITH MAJOR TRAUMA WE LITERALLY CANNOT GET THEM TO THE HOSPITAL SO. WE NEED AN IMMEDIATE SOLUTION TO GET THOSE HANDLE. OVERALL WE CAN'T WAIT TO SOLVE ALL OF THE HOSPITAL THROUGHPUT ISSUES WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE DESERVE ATTENTION BUT- IT JUST LACKS A SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE BECAUSE. WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF A DISASTER. SO THERE ARE YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S A 100% TRUE I MEAN WE'RE WE NEEDED ME TO FIX IS NOW NOT LATER- IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT WORK ANYBODY ELSE WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. FROM COMMITTEE. I WOULD SAY JERRY THIS IS DOCTOR LARRY STOCK- I THINK IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR AN IMMEDIATE FIX THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM COMES DOWN TO- THE COMMITMENT TO OWNERSHIP OF THE PATIENT'S CARE. UPON ARRIVAL TO THE DEPARTMENT I BELIEVE THAT MOST DEPARTMENTS HAVE A TRIAGE NURSE THE TEXT REPORT. AND THE NEED TO PUSH THAT PATIENT FROM- YOU MUST. AGREE TO A HOSPITAL CAREER CHAIR OR THE WAITING ROOM WHERE RESUSCITATION ROOM. AND THAT THE WAY FOR WHATEVER REASON WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE NO NURSE I DOUBT IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE- I NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO RELEASE AT TWO PM. SHE CAN TAKE CARE. OR INTO. PHASE AND IF THAT ONE HELLO WAS. IMMEDIATELY A LOT OF THIS WOULD BE SOLVED SECONDARILY THAT'S RIGHT BELIEVE BE BACK ON ON THAT- ANSWER YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK TO MY YEARS WORKING AND THE EMPLOYERS INDUSTRY ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN AT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THE HOSPITALS TAKING PATIENTS BY YOU'RE RIGHT AND I THINK A LOT OF A START WITH THE TRIAGE ASPECT OF SOME THESE ALSO. OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD SOME HOSPITALS DO A REALLY GOOD JOB OF TRIAGING PATIENT GET HIM OFF THE GURNEY AND OTHERS AREN'T YOU HAVE TO SIT THERE AND WAIT. AND IT'S THE WAY THEY THEY THEY MANAGE THEIR DEPARTMENTS THE WORK STUFF EVERYTHING I KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF A PANDEMIC. BUT I THINK WE CAN COME UP TO BETTER. AT QUICKLY WAYS TO GET THOSE PATIENTS OFF BUT- THAT'S PROBABLY BIGGER DISCUSSION WITH EVERYBODY ELSE- SENT UPON MY COLLEGE HAVE SOME. QUESTIONS SOMEONE ABOARD YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YEAH I WONDERED WITH- I KNOW THAT THIS- ECOSYSTEM- YEP WELL PRETTY. COVED FORTY YEAR- BUT- DURING THIS TIME. HAVE ANY BODY FROM A HOSPITAL SYSTEMS- NO POSSIBLY EITHER LOOKED AT USING SOME OF YOUR- FEDERAL OR STATE COVERED RELIEF MONEY- TRIED- YOU KNOW. NEW OPERATIONAL CHANGES THAT YOU KNOW MIGHT. BE SOMETHING THAT THE POINT TWO. LESSONS KIND OF LEARN FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS- WITH THE RESOURCES KIND OF YOU KNOW WITH THIS I MEAN A HEIGHTENED EMERGE. THAT MIGHT SHED SOME LIGHT ON ON OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES- YOU KNOW AT THAT THAT THAT ENTRY POINT. THE NUMBER OF. NOT SOMEBODY I COULD CALM ON DR MORGAN. DR MORE THOUGHT THAN YES SIR- FIRST- YOU KNOW OUR- FEDERAL DOLLARS HAD ARE STILL FOR OUR US ALONE FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS SHORT OF WHAT WE SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF THE PATIENTS SO AND THERE WERE NO EXTRA EXTRA DOLLARS FOR- FOR THE CARE OF PATIENTS AND I THINK WE HAVE REALLY DONE A LOT OF THINGS AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE REFERRED TO I. T. NURSING WE HAVE USED OUR TEAM NURSING BUT AGAIN WE'RE USING TEAM NURSING TO BE ABLE TO. EXPAND CARE BEYOND NORMAL- BEYOND THE NORMAL LOCATIONS IN AGAIN WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF PATIENTS AND TENTS THAT'S NOT OUR PREFERENCE TO DO THAT WE'VE TAKING OF PATIENTS AND A CONFERENCE ROOMS NOT OUR FRIENDS TO DO SO I MEAN I THINK MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE TO EXPAND CARE HAVE REALLY TRULY HAVE BEEN. CRISIS MEASURES AND WOULD NOT BE THINGS THAT WOULD CHOOSE TO DO- PASSED UP PASSED THE TIME OF A CRISIS I DO THINK THAT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE MADE AROUND- ON. SOME RELAXATION OF THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF WHO CAN PROVIDE A WHAT LEVEL OF CARE SO YOU KNOW THAT ONE OF MY EMERGENCY ROOM COLLEAGUES JUSTIN HAVING AN APPARENT DO ALL OF- THE ENTRY OF MEDICATIONS THAT- THAT HAPPENS NOW WHAT COULD BE DONE AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL SO I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT THAT COULD- PROVIDED- YOU KNOW FOR A QUICK SOLUTION IF WE DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR INSURANCE AUTHORIZATION IF IN A CRISIS. THERE COULD BE A IF THE PATIENTS READY TO BE DISCHARGED THEIR AUTHORIZED TO BE DISCHARGED I WOULD I WOULD A DISCHARGED EIGHTEEN PAID. SIXTEEN SO I THRE ARE SOME MEDIA SOLUTION THAT BE A- ON ALL ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM AND- YOU KNOW I'M NOT INTERESTED PERSONALLY AND- WHO pAND WHO'S NOT DOING THIS AND WHO IS NOT DOING NOT I THINK THE SOLUTIONS ARE ALL REALLY. MULTI FACTORIAL AND THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE SINGLE ANSWER TO. TO CAST THIS ISSUE EITHER WITHIN THE TIME OF CRISIS OR- AS WAY HOPEFULLY SOME POINT THIS HAPPENS THAT WE ARE OUT OF POCKET CRISIS BECAUSE WE KNOW. WE WILL STILL BE LEFT WITH THE ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS AND I WILL JUST IN A SHOT OVER THE YARD ARM RIGHT NOW THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. HEALTH ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THE COPA CRISIS WILL BE THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. THANK THANK ALSO- DO WE HAVE A B. J. BORUSAN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ARE YOU ON THE LINE MAYBE OF ANY FOLLOW UP TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARTS QUESTION REGARDING THE DISASTER RELIEF FUNDS. YES THIS IS B. J. PART ALSO NOT BE KEY AT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THANK YOU- I THINK LAURIE A DOCTOR MORGAN EXPLAINED IT PERFECTLY- BALL HOSPITALS ARE GETTING SOME RELIEF THAT RELIEF IS COMING OVER TIME AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE LOSSES THAT THEY TOOK- I WOULD ALSO STRESS. AGAIN DIFFERENT THAN THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED- IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ANSWER AND SAY TO WORK ON THAT TOOL KIT AS EIGHTY OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY START EXPLORING THIS MULTIFACTORIAL PROBLEMS. AND HOW WE NEED TO SOLVE IT REGIONALLY OUR STATE AS WIDE COMPLEX AND VERY DIFFERENT FROM ONE MONTH SO AND COUNTY TO THE OTHER. AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD ALL DAY LONG TODAY ABOUT THOSE COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND HOSPITALS NEED HELP ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION- THAT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TOOL KIT WAS TO HAVE HOSPITALS DO AS MUCH AS THEY COULD IN THE INSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL RELATIVE TO EACH TREE R. AS- A TECHNOLOGY ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO CHANGE. THE TIME BUT OF COURSE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE VOLUMES HAVE EXACERBATED AND WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF COMMUNITY ISSUES THAT AREN'T BEING ADDRESSED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS HOMELESSNESS SO. I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO START RIGHT AWAY WITH REGIONAL ANSWER COLLECTIVES JUST LIKE WE HAD IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHERE WE CAN ADDRESS THE LOCAL REGIONAL ISSUES WHERE WE CAN DEVELOP DATA THE MEASURE CHANGE. DEVELOP ALL THOSE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE ALTERNATE DESTINATION A TRIAGE ALL OF THOSE INNOVATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING MAKE A LIST OF ALL THE REGULATORY. AND THAT'S A THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO GET. MEDIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT- WASHER SORORITY QUESTIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS I THINK EVERYBODY HAS COVERED JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION- QUITE WELL- YOU KNOW A- I THINK DR MARTIN. POINTED OUT BASS THIS ISSUE IS REALLY REALLY COMPLEX. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT THAT NEED TO BE LOOKED AT AND CHANGE BUT AT THE SAME TIME CHANGING IT IN A MANNER THAT DOESN'T. RISK PATIENT CARE OR OR A COMPROMISE PATIENT CARE AT THE END OF THE DAY- YOU KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE UPDATED- YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A CONVENIENCE STORE. IT'S MEANT TO TAKE CARE OF A YOU KNOW A FEW A FEW CUSTOMERS BUT YOU SEND A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THERE AT ONCE- IT'S NOT GONNA WORK VERY WELL. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY IF YOU GET TWO OR THREE MORE CASHIERS GOING IT'S STILL NOT GOING TO WORK VERY WELL. AND SO IT IT. YOU KNOW HAVING THE SUPPLY SIDE CONTINUE TO SUPPLY WITHOUT HAVING THE THROUGHPUT SIDE. WHICH IS THE E. R. ESSENTIALLY WERE USING E. OURS FOR EVERYTHING- ALBERT I RECALL A CALL WERE WE WERE DEMANDED BY A INTAKE COMMANDER TO TAKE A DEAD PERSON TO THE ER. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT FOR THE CORNER THEY WANT TO OPEN A FREEWAY. WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THAT. AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE THAT WHEN WE HAVE P. R.'S BEING SATURATED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THOSE ALTERNATIVE THINGS IN THOSE ALTERNATIVE- DESTINATIONS TAKE. YOU NO TIME AND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT URGENT KERR'S YOU KNOW THAT GOES TO CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS CLIMATE IF YOU WANT TO OPEN UP AN URGENT CARE WHEN YOU GOTTA GO THROUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THE BUSINESS CLIMATE IS HORRIBLE I WILL TRY TO OPEN UP ANYTHING AND THAT GOES TO SOME OF OUR REGULATIONS AND THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE AFFECTING EMS AND EFFECTING ER'S THOSE NEED TO BE RE EVALUATED AND LOOK AND SEE IF THEY ARE TRULY REGULATIONS THAT ARE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC OR REGULATIONS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY ARE BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY CREATING PROBLEMS IN THE LONG RUN THAT ARE. THAT HAVE ULTIMATELY THE EFFECT OF HURTING. THE PUBLIC- WHEN IT TAKES. THREE HOURS TO DISCHARGE A PATIENT. I REMEMBER BEING IN A ROOM- WITH WITH A PATIENT AND- THAT IS BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME HEY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE ALL CLEAR READY GO HOME I'M LIKE OKAY UNPLUG THAT AND- I'M TAKING AROUND HERE. AND YET THREE HOURS LATER I'M STILL PACING THE HALLWAY GOING YOU GUYS WHAT'S THE HANG UP HERE. IT'S REGULATIONS IT'S HEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A CERTAIN PROCESS TO COVER CERTAIN ASPECTS SO THEY DON'T GET SUED LATER ON IT A LOT OF IT DOES IT COMES BACK TO. THE ENVIRONMENT AND WHEN WE MAKE A REGULATION THAT CREATES A LEGAL ENVIRONMENT GUESS WHAT. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT AND THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF. OF YOU KNOW. THIS IS SHIFTING IT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU KNOW HAD A LOT SAYING HEY YOU KNOW WHAT AMBULANCE- YOU COME IN YOU JUST LOOK YOU KNOW PUT HIM AND PUT HIM IN THE PARKING LOT. AND WILL HAVE ONE PERSON RUN AROUND AND COULD TAKE CARE OF BECAUSE GUESS WHAT THAT PARKING LOT WOULD BECOME FULL. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE MORE PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD NEED THERE. SO THIS IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX ISSUE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT YES OF THE DATA THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN BE USED. BECAUSE IT WILL SHOW US. WHERE SOME OF THIS IS COMING FROM. AND AS- A FIGURES DR MORGAN HAD POINTED OUT YOU KNOW THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PART OF THIS. WHERE DO THEY GO. WELL THE POLICE STOP YOU KNOW POLICE ARE CALLED TO DEAL WITH THEM. THE POLICE GIVEN TO THE PARAMEDICS IN THE PARAMEDICS TO GO OKAY WELL WE HAVE TO TRANSPORT HIM SO THE TRANSPORT OF THE ARE. AND NOW THEY'RE STUCK WITH SOMEBODY. KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. THIS TAKING UP A BED TAKING UP A ROOM CAN'T WE CAN'T ACCEPT MORE WORK MORE PATIENTS THAT ACTUALLY DO NEED HELP. SO YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID THIS IS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS AND YEARS. IT WASN'T NEARLY AS BAD AS IT IS NOW IN WHEN YOU KNOW FORTY YEARS AGO BUT YOU COULD SEE IT WAS STARTING. IT WAS STARTING. AND AND HERE WE ARE TODAY AND WHEN YOU THROW PANDEMIC IN THERE IT REALLY. REALLY ILLUMINATES- THE CRISIS AND- AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE SO WE NEED SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS BUT WE ALSO NEED LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT REGULATIONS WE NEED TO. LOOK AT WAYS OF STREAMLINING THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE- SO THAT TO YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE THE EIGHTEEN PEOPLE THAT THE DOCTOR WAS TALKING ABOUT COULD BE DISCHARGED. WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS THEY'RE READY TO GO HOME THERE THEY KICK ME OUT OF THERE AND THAT BEDS FREE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE AND YET NO IT TAKES ANOTHER. THREE OR FOUR HOURS FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY GET TO GO HOME- SO I FEEL I FEEL FOR OUR- EMS WORKERS I FEEL FOR. THE EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING THE PRE HOSPITAL SETTING. BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM THAT ISN'T WORKING IN CALIFORNIA- WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. SO I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO REALLY WORK WITH THESE EIGHT THESE ENTITIES- TO COME UP WITH SOME. REASONABLE THINGS TO DO IN THE SHORT TERM AND THEN ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK GOING FORWARD. ON THINGS THAT TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GET IMPLEMENTED- BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S JUST GOING TO GET CONTINUALLY WORSE. SO I SUPER APPRECIATE EVERYBODY BEING HERE AND EVERYBODY WHO IS ON A DAY. THE AND JOIN US ON- ON THEIR THEIR- BECAUSE WE NEED YOUR INPUT AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS AND WE NEED EVERYBODY TO WORK TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THIS.
