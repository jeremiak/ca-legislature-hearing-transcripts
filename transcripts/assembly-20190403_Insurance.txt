THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES. CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE IN MANY WAYS AND AND OFTEN THIS IS A GOOD THING. HOWEVER IF THE LAW ALLOWING ELECTRONIC INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS WERE TO SUNSET. WHAT WE WANT TO BE THE ONLY STATE TO NOT ALLOW SUCH TRANSACTIONS? ONLY AB TEN SIXTY FIVE WHAT INDEFINITELY EXTEND THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO OFFER CONSUMERS THE OPTION OF ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS. THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS ANALYSIS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB DETAILING THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AS AN OPTION. INCLUDING CONSUMER CHOICE FASTER DELIVERY REDUCED COST IT'S GREENER AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY IN THE WAKE OF DISASTERS. HOWEVER BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CONSUMERS THE LAW IMPOSES ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS ON INSURERS. FOR EXAMPLE A CONSUMER MUST ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS TRANSMITTED ELECTRONICALLY. SO THAT I MISSED EMAIL OR AN EMAIL THAT AND THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. OF THAT ENDS UP CAUGHT AS SPAM FILTER WILL NOT JEOPARDIZE INSURANCE COVERAGE THE HEIGHTENED STANDARD OF CONSUMER PROTECTION IS FAR GREATER. THAN THE LAW APPLICABLE FOR PAPER DOCUMENTATION AB TEN SIXTY FIVE WOULD RETAIN ALL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHILE PERMANENTLY PRESERVING THE OPTION FOR CONSUMER TO CHOOSE ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. OF INSURANCE DOCUMENTATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF EXPERTS WITH ME TODAY. COMMENTS GO AHEAD MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN STREAKING ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES WANT TO THINK IS A MEMBER OF AN FOR KAREN'S APARTMENT JR.

TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I WENT WITH SOME FRIENDS -- AND OTHER FIREFIGHTERS -- FROM MY STATION AND FROM MY AREA TO THE ROUTE NINETY ONE HARVEST FESTIVAL IN LAS VEGAS -- IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A RELAXING NIGHT OF GOOD MUSIC -- IT WAS ACTUALLY THE LAST DAY OF THE OF THE CONCERT WE ARE GETTING READY TO GO HOME -- AND IT TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE -- MY COLLEAGUE DAVID ARNOLD WHO WORKS WITH ME AND I WERE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM STAGE RIGHT. WHEN WE HEARD A LOUD POPPING NOISE -- WE THOUGHT IT WAS FIRECRACKERS UNTIL -- SOME DAR LIQUID SPLATTERED ON DAVID ARNOLD SPACE. AND EVERYONE STARTED RUNNING -- LITTLE DID WE KNOW WHEN DAY WHEN TO GO WHITE THE LIQUID FROM HIS FACE HE NOTICED IT WASN'T A DRINK BUT IT WAS PROBABLY JUST SOME BLOOD -- YET AT THAT TIME WE KNEW NOTHING WAS WRONG BUT WE WEREN'T CLEAR YET ON WHAT WAS GOING ON THEN WE SAW SOMEONE LYING ON THE FLOOR. AHEAD OF US AND A GENTLEMAN WAS HOLDING INDIVIDUALS NECK -- WE WENT OVER TO GO RENDER AID AND I ASKED THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS HOLDING PRESSURE ON THE PATIENT'S NECK WHAT WAS WRONG HE SAID HE HAD BEEN SHOT. AND THAT'S WHEN WE KIND OF PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND NOTICED THAT IT WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER -- WE RAN OVER AND RENDERED AID I STE I STARTED DOING CPR -- AND DAVE CHECKED -- FOR OTHER SECONDARY INJURIES AND WOUNDS -- AND DURING ALL THAT TIME. A HAIL OF GUNFIRE RAIN DOWN UPON US FROM ABOVE -- EVERY TIME THAT HAPPENED WE WOULD STOP CPR AND STOP GIVING AID AND WE WOULD -- COVER PATIENT TRY TO MAKE OURSELVES AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE WHILE -- OTHER CONCERT GOERS WERE KINDA TRAMPLING AROUND US AND ON TOP OF US -- WE JUST KEPT COVERING THAT INDIVIDUAL WAITING FOR THE SHOOTING TO PASS -- AND THEN WE CONTINUE -- TO TO ADMINISTER CPR WHEN THE SHOOTING STOPPED BRIEFLY -- WE SAW THAT MOST EVERYONE HAD ESCAPED -- ESCAPE THE AREA. THE STAGE LIGHTS WERE SHINING ON US -- WHICH WERE WHICH WAS LIGHTING ARE SCAPE ROUTE BUT THEY ALSO MADE US -- KIND OF LIKE A PERFECT TARGET I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY. THE NEXT ROUND A RAPID FIRE WAS AIMED IN OUR GENERAL DIRECTIONS -- BULLETS WERE HITTING THE GROUND ALL AROUND AND WE KEPT ADMINISTERING CPR -- MIND YOU WHEN THE BULLETS WERE FLYING IN OUR GENERAL AREA OR IN OUR DIRECTION THAT WE COULD FEEL -- WE WOULD COVER THE PATIENT TRY TO MAKE OR SELL THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE GIVE HIM A FIGHTING CHANCE. AND GIVE US A FIGHTING CHANCE ALSO -- AROUND THE FIFTH FIFTH OR SIX OF ALL YOUR MAG CHANGE -- A RAPID FIRE. WE ARE ALL TALKING AMONGST OURSELVES AND WE'RE GETTING READY TO MOVE THE PATIENT BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ACTIVE SHOOTER EVENT. KNOWN WAS COMING TO OUR AID AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS INDIVIDUAL IS THE BEST CHANCE WE AND WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT MOVING THE PATIENT THAT'S WHEN -- I SAID OKAY LET'S FINISH MY LAST ROUND CPR AND THAT'S WHEN I WAS STRUCK IN THE RIGHT ARM THE RIGHT FORM -- THERE WAS NOTHING MORE WE COULD DO FOR THE VICTIM BUT WE KNEW IF WE STAYED THERE WE'RE GOING TO DIE -- WE RAN FOR OUR LIVES -- THE BULLETS WERE. WE COULD HEAR AND FEEL THEY WERE GETTING CLOSER. IT FELT IT FELT AS THOUGH THE GUNMEN HAD -- KIND OF SINGLE THIS OUT WHILE WE WERE. MAKING -- MAKING A RUN FOR TO TRY TO GET OUT OF THE ARENA AND THE AREA -- THE REST OF WHAT HAPPENED IS A BIT HAZY BUT I REMEMBER WE GOT INTO A CAR AND THEY DROVE ME TO THE CLOSEST HOSPITAL -- AT THAT TIME I WAS LOSING A LOT OF BLOOD I ENDED UP. MY MY ASSOCIATE DAVID ARNOLD AND I WE ENDED UP FINDING A HANDKERCHIEF ON THE GROUND I APPLIED A TOURNIQUET BUT STILL FROM HOW FAR WE RAN FROM WHEN WE GOT OUT OF THE CONCERT WHERE I ACTUALLY GOT INTO A VEHICLE I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER KIND OF LIKE THE FOG. OF WHAT HAPPENED -- IN THE EARLY STAGES A SHOCK. I EVENTUALLY SPENT SIX DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND LOST ABOUT A LEADER OF BLOOD FROM WHAT THEY FROM AT THE HOSPITAL STAFF TELLS ME -- NEXT TO BEING SHOT I WOULD GUESS TO SAY THAT -- THAT WORKERS COMPENSATION. OR WORKERS COMP PROCESS -- AND JUST THE PAPERWORK IN GENERAL HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST NIGHTMARE -- BUT I REMEMBER I TOOK AN OATH AS A FIREFIGHTER TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC I WAS FOLLOWING THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN I WAS OUT OF THE STATE NOW TO THE COUNTY THAT I SERVE AND DESPERATELY TRYING TO SAVE THAT INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE. BUT AFTER ALL THE PAPERWORK -- THE WORD CAME BACK DENIED -- MY PAPERWORK THAT IS -- THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN OFF DUTY FIREFIGHTER WE DO TAKE AN OATH AND WE RECOGNIZE OUR BOUNDARIES BUT WE ARE ALWAYS ON THE JOB -- WE WE ARE TRAINED FIRST RESPONDERS -- AND HAVE A DUTY THAT A PUBLIC NO MATTER WHAT THE EMERGENCY OR WHATEVER ARISES -- IT'S TRUE THAT MANY CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO DID THEIR DUTY THAT NIGHT -- BOTH ACTIVE RETIRED MILITARY EVERYTHING -- IT'S TRUE FOR MYSELF THAT MANY OTHER CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS WHO RENDERED AID -- WHEN THE WORST HAPPENED IF EVER THERE WAS A JOB RELATED INJURY IT WAS THIS EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE SWORN TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC.

OKAY AS FOR A VOTE [inaudible] ARE THERE. SINCE HER WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND THEN -- AND THE MISTER GIBSON WILL HAVE A QUESTION A SOON HERE GO AHEAD. YOU'RE RIGHT. BY CHAIR SO SO CA SHANNON SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. OTHER FOLKS TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. ARE THERE PERSONS SPEAKING AGAINST THIS BILL WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AGAINST IT [inaudible] WELL. YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FATE CALMLY WITH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. WERE WE RESPECTFULLY HAVING OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL RIGHT NOW -- FOR ONE REASON LAST YEAR WE JOINED A COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND PUBLIC EMPLOYERS TO COLLABORATE ON THE CHAIRS AB SEVENTEEN FORTY NINE WHICH PROVIDED A WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ACTS THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS OF PEACE OFFICERS. THAT COLLABORATION. WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS OF SEVENTEEN FORTY NINE RESULTED IN LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWED LOCAL AGENCIES TO PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS TO PEACE OFFICERS WHO ARE IN STE INJURED OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE AMENDMENTS ALSO PLACE NECESSARY PROTECTIONS FOR THE EMPLOYER IN PLACE THAT STRUCK A BALANCE BETWEEN ENSURING THOSE OFFICERS ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTS OUTSIDE THE STATE COULD STATUTORILY BE COVERED BY WORKERS COMP. BUT ALSO PROTECTED EMPLOYERS FROM CIVIL LIABILITY AND THE I'M UNPREDICTABLE EXPOSURE ARE CREATED BY THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF AB. SEVENTEEN FORTY NINE AB NINE THIRTY TO CREATE THE DISPARITY BETWEEN PEACE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS 2% OUT OF STATE INJURY CLAIMS TO THEIR EMPLOYERS. THERE'S A NEED TO HAVE CLARITY IN LA BETWEEN THESE TWO CLASSIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES SO WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON MOVING TOWARD CLARIFYING THAT -- WHEN THIS BILL MOVES TO THE PROCESS THANK YOU. GO AHEAD SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AT MY NAME'S JASON SMELTER I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND SEE SEC ACCESS INSURANCE AUTHORITY. FIRST OF ALL IT'S ONE OF KNOWLEDGE ALONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE THE BRAVERY OF NOT ONLY THIS FIREFIGHTER AND THE PEACE OFFICERS BUT EVERYBODY THAT WAS THERE THAT RENDER DATE -- WE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- LISTEN WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH FAITH AND THE ONLY FOR THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- QUICKLY WHY WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS WE HAVE ON A POLICY BASIS ABOUT HOW THIS IS DONE SUPPOSED WHETHER IT'S DONE FIRST. WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT INVESTIGATIVE DIFFICULTIES HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE ACTUALLY BEING ENGAGED AND AT THE TIME -- THESE INCIDENTS CAN BE VERY HAZY SO WE'RE A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT COMPILING A FACT PATTERN THAT WHEN WE DO INVESTIGATIONS ON CLAIMS. TO AS YOU MENTIONED WERE WORRIED ABOUT POTENTIAL CIVIL LIABILITY. AT THIRD IS SCOPE AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY THE BIGGEST ONE IF LIKE IF I COULD FOCUS THERE FOR A SECOND. I THINK WHAT YOU HEARD EARLIER IS A VERY CLEAR DESCRIPTION -- OF A CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER WHICH WE WOULD WANT TO PROVIDE THIS COVERAGE OUTSIDE THE STATE WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL -- AND THINK OF ALL THE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH IT COULD BE APPLIED -- SO NO WE NEED TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION AND LOOK AT KIND OF THE DAILY TYPES OF CLAIMS THAT WE RECEIVE -- AS PUBLIC EMPLOYERS AND SO WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE BILL AS DRAFTED BECAUSE IT IT ITS SCOPE IS FAR BEYOND THE SPECIFIC SITUATION -- DISCUSSED HERE -- AGAIN MUCH LIKE -- THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND GET TO A PLACE JUST LIKE WE DID ON SEVENTEEN FORTY NINE I WERE WE CAN SUPPORT THE BILL -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT SO THANK YOU. JUST FOR THE RECORD -- WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING AMENDMENTS TODAY TO THE BILL -- BUT IT IS NICE THAT THE AUTHOR IS -- IS OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS BUT THERE'S NO RECOMMENDATION TO AMEND IT TODAY -- ANY OTHER FOLKS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. JOSH DUGGAR REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES -- BOTH ALSO OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MARKETS THAT WHETHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH OUR COLLEAGUES FROM BEFORE WE ARE ALSO OPPOSE MUST AMENDED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. IF NOT OF A COUPLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAID QUESTIONS MISTER GIBSON HAD A COMMENT OR QUESTION AND AND BERMAN HAS ONE AND THEN MISTER COOPER HAS. ONE GO AHEAD MIKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER WE DIGEST IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN WE DID A BILL LIKE THIS LAST YEAR FOR POLICE OFFICERS CORRECT CORRECT. CORRECT -- AND LET ME IS SIMPLY SAYS A FORMER POLICE OFFICER AND MISSED COOLEY I'M SUSAN MISTER COOPER'S HERE AND OTHERS -- WHEN WE WERE FIRST WHEN I FIRST TOOK A OF NO ONE TOLD ME THAT I WAS ALWAYS TOLD I'LL BE POLICE OFFICER SEVEN DAYS A WEEK? YOU KNOW WITHOUT STOP IF WE EMERGENCY OR SITUATION WENT DOWN WE RESPOND -- I HAVE PERSONAL FRIENDS WHO ARE FIREFIGHTERS MY NEIGHBOR. BEHIND ME IS A FIRE CAPTAIN -- SAME EXACT THING THE FIRE ACADEMY -- ONCE YOU WENT THROUGH THE CAT A ME YOU WERE A FIREFIGHTER RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES -- YOU KNOW WHEN THEY HAPPEN MY SISTER -- A NURSE PRACTITIONER -- SAME EXACT THING HOW CAN YOU SEPARATE AND SAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK SHOULD NOT PUT YOURSELF TO RENDER AID WHEN AID IS CALLED UPON. IN THE SITUATION OF LOS VEGAS. PEOPLE RESPONDED ACCORDINGLY -- BUT TO COME BACK HOME AND BE DENIED COMPENSATION -- FOR THIS KIND OF A HOT ACT OF HORROR ISN'T -- I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S DESPICABLE IS REALLY DESPICABLE TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN GOES FIRST RESPONDERS RESPONDING TO THOSE KINDS OF EMERGENCIES -- AND I THOUGHT WE JUST DID THIS OF POLICE OFFICERS AND I WOULD JUST OFFER -- THIS TO THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THAT LIKE TO BE CONSIDERS CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL I THINK YOU MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE SHOULD DO THIS. AND WE SHOULD DO IT NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON -- MISTER COOPER BUT AS A QUESTION OR COMMENT. JUST A COMMENT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN EXTRAORDINARY VINCE I WANNA THINK THE OFFICE BRING THIS FORWARD. IN A FIREFIGHTER FOR HIS BRAVE ACTIONS IT REALLY THE ONUS IS ON THE EMPLOYEE THE BURDENS ON THE EMPLOYEE TO SHOW THE INJURIES GREW OF ACTIVITIES. THEIR JOB OR DO YOU RELATED. AND OTHER ENGAGING IN RESCUE PROTECTIVE ACTIONS SO WE KNOW THE WORKERS COMP PROCESS IS A VERY ONEROUS PROCESS. SO THERE TO ME YOUR CHECKS AND BALANCES IN PLACE TO BE HONEST THE UNIVERSE FOR THIS IS IS NOT BIG UNIVERSE. IN FUTURE INSTANCE LIKE THIS I MEAN THEY DON'T COME ACROSS EVERY DAY. SELECT THINK -- FOR THE SOME CONCERNS -- THAT WERE -- PRESENTED BY THE OPPOSITION -- ASSEMBLY FIND A GREAT DEAL SUBSTANCE IN THAT SIDE SUPPORTIVE. OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANT TO THANK MR COURTS I'M ALWAYS GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL -- AND TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE SO THE THAT I I'M SURE YOU DON'T RECALL BUT THE THE ARTISTS THAT WAS ON STAGE WHEN THE SHOOTING BROKE OUT WAS JASON ALDEAN CORRECT -- IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THAT I WAS WITH MY FIANCE IMAGES NOW THE IN CONCERT IN MOUNTAIN VIEW IN MY DISTRICT SING AND DANCE ALONG AND HAVE AN AWESOME TIME. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE -- GOING FROM SINGING ALONG THE NIGHT TRAIN OR ONE OF HIS OTHER SONGS AND THEN IMMEDIATELY SPRING INTO ACTION -- AND KEEPING YOURSELF IN DANGER AS YOU TRY TO RENDER AID TO SOMEBODY WHO'S WHO'S BEEN SHOT RATHER THAN RUNNING. OUT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SO -- I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU -- FOR YOUR ACTIONS THAT NIGHT I'M SORRY THAT THE SYSTEM FAILED YOU WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO CALIFORNIA -- BUT LET'S REMEDY THAT SITUATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN MR BIGELOW. FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT SERVICE AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO AND WHAT WHAT YOU STAND. AND REPRESENT HERE'S SOMEBODY WHO WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY TO RENDER AID TO SOMEONE ELSE -- TO THE TO THE AUTHOR -- RECOGNIZING -- WHAT THIS BILL DOES I WANNA? FIND OUT IF YOUR IT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING THIS WOULD APPLY. TO RESERVE DEPUTIES AND HEY CALL FIREFIGHTERS. OFTENTIMES USE OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS WILL BE ON THE FRONTLINE WHO SOMETIMES ARE FULLY RECOGNIZED. BUT THEY ARE CALLED TO DUTY AT THE VERY MOMENT. A FULL TIME PERSON IS CALLED TO DUTY WHEN THOSE MOMENTS HAPPEN I BEING ONE OF THOSE -- INDIVIDUALS OF FORTY SEVEN YEARS AND BEEN CALLED MANY TIMES AND EVEN TO THIS DAY. IF YOU ARE MY PICK UP YOU'LL FIND MY GEAR IT'S READY TO SERVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF BOTH MALE AND FEMALE WHO GIVE THEIR LIVES SOMETIMES ON THAT FRONT LINE. AND BEING SOMEONE WHO JUST FINISHED TAKING THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. MANAGEMENT -- COURSES AND TESTING TO BECOME NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AND CERTIFIED FOR NATIONAL EVENT WHICH WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THESE -- I THINK FOLKS LIKE THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED. BECAUSE WHEN THAT CRISIS LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN THIS STATE OCCURS. IT'S GOING TO BE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THEY'RE GOING TO BE CALLED. WHETHER IT BE A MAJOR CATASTROPHIC EVENT OF A FIRE WHERE THERE'S A CATASTROPHIC EVENT OF A A DERANGED INDIVIDUAL WHO'S FIRING AIMLESSLY FOR NOTE. PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO HARM. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THE SAME PEOPLE WOULD BE INCLUDED AND IF YOU WOULD BE SO. INCLINED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FOLKS ARE INCLUDED I WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND HELP YOU WITH THIS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER COOLEY. HELLO I THINK FOR BRING THIS BILL FOR IT AND AS I JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PLEASURES AS IT WERE OF BEING A LAWYER. IS IT FROM TIME TO TIME YOUR LINES IN THE LAW. THAT ARE BIGGER THAN THE CASE IN WHICH THEY ARE UTTERED. AND ABOUT A CENTURY AGO THERE WAS A FAMOUS SUPREME COURT DECISION WRITTEN BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. NINETEEN TWENTY ONE BROWN VERSUS US IN WHICH HE STATED. DETACHED REFLECTION. IS NOT REQUIRED IN THE FACE OF AN UP LIFTED KNIFE. AND I THINK THAT CAPTURES THIS MOMENT THAT THERE'S TIMES WHEN THINGS ARISE. THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RESPOND. TO AND RESPOND TO INSTINCTIVELY. AND THAT'S THERE'S ALLOWANCE FOR THAT.

IT'S A GREAT COMMITTEE. UNFORTUNATELY. THIS -- AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY NINE AS I SAID A SPONSORED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. IT ADDRESSES A FEE REVENUE FROM INSURERS -- AND THE MONEY IS THEN DISTRIBUTED TO LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE FRAUD. AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE FRAUD IS ESTIMATED TO COST EVERY POLICY HOLDER IN THE STATE BETWEEN TWO AND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR -- EVERY YEAR PROSECUTORS APPLY FOR MORE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT. THE AUTOMOBILE ANTI FRAUD PROGRAM IS SUPPORTED BY TWO FEES ONE FOR GENERAL ANTI FRAUD EFFORTS IN THE OTHER TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET ORGANIZED CRIME EFFORTS. THE FEES TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED IN TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS RESPECTIVELY. AGAIN WE'RE DEALING WITH TWO DIFFERENT FEES. THIS BILL SIMPLY RAISES THESE FEES TO BETTER ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND LOCAL PROSECUTORS TO ENFORCE OUR EXISTING ANTI FRAUD LAWS. I THINK MR MR LARA IT MIGHT WITH MY SCRIPT SAYS MICHAEL MARTINEZ YOU'RE NOT MIKE MARTINEZ. MISTER MISTER RICARDO LARA OF THE ELECTED. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE STATE IS HERE WITH ME TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BEEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DALY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CHRISTINE GARCIA SAN AND I'M A SUPERVISING DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF A DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEFF ROSEN I IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN OR SIXTEEN SEVENTY NINE AS A CHAIRMAN DALY MENTIONED OF THE COST OF INSURANCE FRAUD TO CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA IS TWO TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER CONSUMER IF YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY THE NUMBER OF LICENSED INSURED DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BETWEEN FOUR POINT SIX AND SIX POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH COST CONSUMERS AS A RESULT OF AUTO INSURANCE FRAUD. A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO CONDUCT TO COLLABORATE ON OUT REACH AN INVESTIGATION PROSECUTIONS OF THESE AUTO FRAUD IN INSURANCE CASES. AND WE I KNOW AT LEAST ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTY -- WERE LIMITED BY THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE FOR EVERY INVESTIGATION THAT WERE ABLE TO OPEN THEIR EIGHT TO TEN INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACT ON SO THESE RESOURCES WOULD BE VERY MUCH WELCOME BYE -- EVERYONE IS INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INSURANCE FRAUD AND FOR THOSE REASONS I'D ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION.

ELEVEN TWO ZERO BILLS AT ELEVEN ZERO STALEY ANOTHER BILL GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE LAST BILL IS -- A. B. NINE EIGHTY ONE WHICH DEALS WITH INSURANCE PRIVACY. OF TO OUR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS -- THERE IS A DETAILED ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN GIVEN. THE AMENDMENTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT HOLD THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE FOR DATA BREACHES. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. WHICH ADDRESS THE USE OF MINORS INFORMATION. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO EXPRESS INTENT TO HARMONIZE THE PRIVACY RULES IN THE INSURANCE CODE WITH THE RULES IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. UNDER THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. ANOTHER AMENDMENT EXPRESSES INTENT TO INCORPORATE INSURANCE PRIVACY REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN THE INSURANCE CODE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. DOING SO I BELIEVE WILL MAKE THE LAW MORE ACCESSIBLE TO CONSUMERS. IT ADDS LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS REGARDING THE CENTRAL ROLE THE DATA COLLECTION PLAYS AN INSURANCE RATE SETTING UNDERWRITING IN CLAIMS HANDLING. I INTRODUCED THIS BILL TO OPEN A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND PRIVACY ADVOCATES TO FIND A WAY TO CONTINUE. THE DECADES LONG REGULATION OF INSURANCE PRIVACY BY THE ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. OUR INSURANCE PRIVACY LAWS ARE SHOWING THEIR AGE AND PASSAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA [inaudible] CONSUMER. PRIVACY ACT HAS PROMPTED US ALL TO GIVE NEW CONSIDERATION HOW WE GO ABOUT PROTECTING CONSUMER PRIVACY. I WANT TO THANK THE PRIVACY ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE ENGAGED WITH US ON THIS BILL AND ON THESE ISSUES. THE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN THOUGHTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY TO ALLOW THOSE DISCUSSIONS TO CONTINUE. MISTER JOHN SURE RAKING IN FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND MR JEREMY MURS FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS OF AMERICA. ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I MOVES A BILL THAT. THANK YOU CHEN MEMBERS JOHN KERRY CAN ON BEHALF ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. MR DALY DID A GREAT JOB SUMMARIZING THE BILL IN OUR EFFORTS ALL KEEP MY COMMENTS RELATIVELY SHORT THIS MORNING. BREAD DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT INSURES ATTACH STRONG PRIVACY RULES ON THE BOOKS FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. AND OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER COMMISSIONER LAUREN THE DEPARTMENT SHARON'S FASTER OF OUR POLICY HOLDERS AND CONSUMERS WELL. BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO ADVANCE IN CHANGED SO MUCH OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING WITH CONSUMER PRIVACY GROUPS TO UPDATE OUR PRIVACY LAWS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATIONS AND AS A MOVE THIS BILL FOR TODAY SO WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT JOB. SELECT LAST RIVAL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS YOUR MEMBERS THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. ALSO WITHOUT A VOICE TODAY -- BUT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF AB -- NINE EIGHTY ONE I'LLKEEP IT BRIEF WITH THE THE TO MOTIONS WE WOULD -- ASSOCIATE -- OURSELVES LARGER WITH THE CHAIRS COMMENTS -- IN WITH MR SHURIKENS COMMENTS -- WE THANK THE PRIVACY GROUPS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT MODERNIZING THE AYE AYE PPA WE THINK THEY'VE BEEN PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS -- THEY WE LOOK FOR THOSE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUING -- AS INSURERS WE'VE LIVED UNDER THIS COMPREHENSIVE STATUTORY SCHEME FOR THIRTY YEARS -- SO UPDATING MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND WE ARE DR -- TODAY.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME SAMANTHA CORBIN AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENTS -- COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION A CO SPONSOR OF EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE ACLU CALIFORNIA THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE. IN ADDITION I'M THE PRIMARY COORDINATOR OF THE COALITION OF MORE THAN A DOZEN PRIVACY ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY COMMITTED BOTH TO PRESERVING AND STRENGTHENING AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AT FIRST I WANT TO START BY THINKING THE CHAIR. HIS COMMITTEE AND THE PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE FOR WEEKS OF DIALOGUE. I WHICH IS BEEN ONGOING AND THOUGHTFUL AND WELL WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE DO STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT AB -- NINE EIGHT ONE AND RESPECTFULLY DO OPPOSE THE BILL AS WRITTEN -- PULLING CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATE THAT A BIPARTISAN SUPERMAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS VALUE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND DESIRE STRONG STATUTORY PROTECTIONS AS WELL AS THE RIGHT TO ENSURE THE RIGHTS ARE ENFORCED. LAST YEAR THE PASSAGE OF THE CPA WHICH ESTABLISHED IMPORTANT RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW HOW BUSINESSES FROM ANY INDUSTRY COLLECT AND SELL PERSONAL INFORMATION WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND MEETING THIS DEMAND. AS WRITTEN THIS BILL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN THE LAW AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT CALIFORNIANS WANT AND DESERVE IN PART THIS IS DUE TO A LACK OF THE MODERNIZATION IN THE I. P. P. A. AS WELL AS THE FACT. THAT MOST EXISTING INSURANCE LAWS HAVE HURRY MERRILY BEEN WRITTEN FROM THE CORPORATE INSURANCE INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE RATHER THAN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CONSUMERS THAT THEY SEEK TO SERVE. TODAY AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME -- BRIEFLY COVER SOME OF THE MORE CONCERNING ISSUES THAT WE DO HAVE WITH THE CURRENT VERSION OF NINE EIGHT ONE FIRST THE DEFINITION OF PROTECTED PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE C. C. P. A. IS FAR BROADER THAN WHAT IS COVERED IN AYE PPA. AS A RESULT IN AT A MINIMUM CONSUMERS AND MUST BE EXPANDED TO MATCH THE DEFINITIONS IN THE CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. SECOND THE SCOPE OF THE I. P. P. A.'S LIMITED TO INDIVIDUALS FOR APPLICANTS OR WHO OTHERWISE ALREADY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WHERE WITH THE INSURER WHERE IS THE CCPA PROVIDES RIGHTS FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. WITH A PARTICULAR ENTITY. THIRD THIS ECPA PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH RIGHTS TO PORTABILITY AND DELETION ESSENTIALLY THE IDEA THAT A CONSUMER OWNS OUR INFORMATION AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A COPY OF THAT INFORMATION AND TRANSFERIT TO ANOTHER ENTITY IF SO DESIRED. AND FURTHER THAT A CONSUMER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK THAT THE ENTITY DELETE THAT INFORMATION IT POSSESSES ABOUT THE CONSUMER. THE LACK OF MODERNIZATION IN THE AYE PPA ARGUABLY OUTDATED NATURE OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S IN PERSON AND ON PAPER BUSINESS MODEL AND CONFUSING PROVISIONS WHICH SEEMINGLY ALLOW INSURERS TO DENY CONSUMERS REQUEST TO RECEIVE OR DELETE THEIR OWN DATA FOR ANY REASON AT ALL. WE ALL NEED TO BE REVISED IN ORDER TO MERE THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED THROUGH THE CCPA. OUT FOURTH THERE'S AN ENORMOUS DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR NOTICE AND DISCLOSURE OF PRIVACY RIGHTS IN THE C. C. P. EIGHT AND THE I. PA. SIGNIFICANT HARMONIZATION AND MODERNIZATION HERE WE NEED TO OCCUR TO ADEQUATELY INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT DATA PRACTICES AND TO ATTAIN THEIR CONSENT IN ORDER TO MATCH THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED. TO THEM THROUGH. THREE SEVENTY FIVE FINALLY AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- REGARDING THE DATA BREACH PROVISION -- BUT WE DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT -- AND PARTICULARLY A CONSUMER'S RIGHTS TO TAKE ACTION -- SHOULD AN INSURER FAIL TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW AND WE DEFINITELY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE RESOURCES IN THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND IF THEY ARE IN FACT ADEQUATE -- TO ACT AS ESSENTIALLY THE REGULATORY BODY ON PRIVACY SPECIFICALLY. IN THIS MANNER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CAN A CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR OFFER. SKEWS ME WITH YOUR OFFICE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS WERE CONSUMER PRIVACY AWARE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS IS IN PRINT TODAY -- WELL WE'RE OPPOSED TO NINETY ONE WE DO APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY WITH A CO SPONSOR OF AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT LAST YEAR. AT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT PROVIDED IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND MECHANISM FOR CALIFORNIANS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS TO PRIVACY PROVIDED. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CZ P. A. ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO KNOW ALL THE DATA BUSINESS COLLECT ABOUT YOU DELETE DATA YOU'VE BEEN. YOU'VE GIVEN TO A BUSINESS HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY NO TO THE SALE OF YOUR INFORMATION AND HOLD COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE IN THE X. CENTER THEY KNEW NOT DO NOT TAKE REASONABLE MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR DATA. I AM EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY ONE WOULD EXEMPT INSURANCE INSTITUTIONS AGENTS AND THEIR INSURANCE SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS FROM THE C. CPA. THE CURRENT PRIVACY FRAMEWORK FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY DOES NOT PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. THAT ACCOUNTS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ARE PROVIDED UNDER THE TCPA AND AS A BASELINE WE THINK THAT WE'RE THAT THERE IS OVERLAPPING LAW THE CCPA SHOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE. AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED THE TCPA PROVIDE THE CONSUMER THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT DATA A BUSINESS OF COLLECTED ABOUT THE CONSUMER. CURRENT INSURANCE LAW AND REGULATION APPEAR TO PROVIDE A MUCH MORE LIMITED SCOPE OF WHAT A CONSUMER CAN REQUEST AND WHAT AN INSURER MUST DISCLOSE THIS IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL EXAMPLES WERE EXISTING INSURANCE LAW AND REGULATION DOES NOT PROVIDE. PRIVACY PROTECTIONS COMMENSURATE WITH THE C. C. P. A AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. AT THIS POINT AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR [inaudible] GREAT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LIKE MATIC REPRESENTING CONSUMER WATCHDOG -- MY WE WE ARE PROPOSED TO AB. NINETY ONE BECAUSE EXEMPTS INSURANCE INSTITUTIONS AGENTS AND INSURANCE SUPPORT ORGANIZATION I'M GONNA MAKE A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS AND TRYING NOT TO BE REDUNDANT. THE THE FIRST IS THE DEFINITION OF SINCE INSURANCE SUPPORT ORGANIZATION. NOW SOME INSURANCE ABOARD ORGANIZATIONS ARE ANY INSTITUTION ENGAGING IN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES SET FORTH IN THE U. S. CODE. TITLE TWELVE AND THAT'S DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND CENTS PER OUR FINANCIAL COAT THAT'S LANDING EXCHANGING. TRANSFERRING CREDIT CARDS INVESTING SAFEGUARDING MONEY OR SECURITIES ISSUING -- INSURING ISSUING ANNUITIES ACTING AS A PRINCIPAL AGENT OR BROKER PROVIDING FINANCIAL INVESTMENT OR ECONOMIC ADVISORY SERVICES AMONG ANY MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ARE SET FORTH IN THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF NINETEEN FORTY IN ESSENCE WHEN YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION IS DISCLOSED OR DATE IS PACKED. WHILE IN THE POSSESSION OF ANY INSURANCE COMPANY. AGENT OR FINANCIAL SERVICE AND AT THE HERE WILL BE NO PROTECTION FOR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE THERE'S NO PORTABILITY OF YOUR INFORMATION AND THERE'S NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO RECOVER DAMAGES. THE ONLY PENALTIES AVAILABLE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CAN FIND A COMPANY YOU CAN SUSPEND THEIR LICENSE. AND HE CAN ALLOW AN ACTION FOR EQUITY THAT MEANS IF I'M MY DATE IS BRIDGE I GO TO EQUITY COURT. AND EIGHT ASPIRIN JUNCTION I MEAN SOMEONE SPEND A TON OF MONEY JUST TO GET THEM TO NOT DO SOMETHING OR TO DO SOMETHING I WANT THEM TO DO. THERE'S NO RECOVERY FOR DAMAGES. NOW I WISH I WAS WRONG BUT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WHEN WE WROTE THIS LAW IT WAS STATE OF THE ART NOW NOT SO MUCH. SO. THE PROPONENTS OF NINE NINE EIGHT ONE OF ARGUE THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ARE SUFFICIENT FOR CONSUMERS. OR THAT THE TCPA PREAMPS AND PREVENTS THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FROM IS ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. THE FACT IS THAT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CAN STILL DO EVERYTHING HE ALREADY CAN'T DO. NOTHING CHANGES ON THE REGULATORY SIDE OF THE EQUATION. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT CONSUMERS CAN TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT THEIR OWN INFORMATION. ALL COMPANIES HAVE TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO PROTECT THEIR DATA. AND IF THEIR INFORMATION IS DISCLOSED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION AND THEY DID NOT TAKE REASONABLE STEPS THE KEY WORDS TO PROTECT THAT. THEN THE CONSUMER HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO RECOVER DAMAGES. IN CLOSING NINE EIGHT ONE MERELY SHIELDS THE ENTIRE INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL INDUSTRIES FROM ANY REAL OR ENFORCEABLE DUTIES. RESPONSIBILITIES OR INCENTIVES TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL PRIVATE INFORMATION OF CALIFORNIANS. SO ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PRIVATE. INFORMATION WILL REMAIN VULNERABLE IN OUR FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT THE REMEDIES PROVIDED IN THE C. C. PA. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE WOULD. CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BUT PLEASE MAKE SURE THESE JUST STATE YOUR AND YOUR NAME AN ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION. TO BE AN ATTACK OR THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH -- THE AUTHOR AND STAKEHOLDERS. GREAT SEEING NO FURTHER WITNESSES AND IN OPPOSITION I WILL COME BACK TO THE A COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] MR COOLEY. WELL I JUST WANT TO JUMP IN IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- AND I'LL ACTUALLY MOVE THE BILL IT STARTED TO MOVE AND WILL OKAY -- THE UNDERLYING LAWN THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THERE FOR FORTY YEARS. IT WAS ADOPTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY I PROBABLY HAD A HAND IN WRITING THE ANALYSES ON THAT BILL DRAFTING THE BILL. IT WAS BASED UPON ANY I SEE MODEL. SOURCES REGULATION WASN'T JUST A CALIFORNIA IDEA WAS A NATIONAL IDEA GROW THE NATIONAL REGULATORY SYSTEM. INSURANCE IS A SPECIALIZED JERRY BECAUSE YOU CONDUCTED VISITORS BASED UPON THE USE OF INFORMATION THIS IS A PROCESS KNOWN AS UNDERWRITING. AN UNDERWRITING SOMETHING PLAYS OUT OVER TIME BASED ON THE THAT'S AVAILABLE AND PERMISSION TO READ JUST. I THINK FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL TO KNOW WHY THIS STATUTE THAT MISTER DALY'S BILL OF PRESERVING PLACE SUPPLIES. THIS REMARK SECTION SEVEN NINETY ONE INSURANCE CO FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY IT IS NOT BEEN MODIFIED SINCE PASSED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY WHICH I THINK INDICATES THE SUBTLE NATURE OF THIS LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS ESTABLISHED TENER FOR THE COLLECTION USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. GATHERING CONNECTS WITH INTEREST TRANSACTIONS BY INSURANCE INSTITUTIONS AGENTS OR INSURANCE SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS. TO MAINTAIN A BALANCE WHEN THE NEED FOR INFORMATION BY THOSE CONDUCTING THE BUSINESS INSURANCE. IN THE PUBLIC'S NEED FOR FAIRNESS AND INSURANCE INFORMATION PRACTICES. INCLUDING THE NEED TO MINIMIZE INTRUSIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A REGULATORY MECHANISM. TO ENABLE NATURAL PERSONS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT INFORMATION BEING OR HAS BEEN COLLECTED ABOUT THEM. CONNECT WITH INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE ACCESS TO SUCH INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF VERIFYING OR JUST PRUDENCE ACCURACY. TO LIMIT THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED IN CONNECTION WITH INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. INTO ENABLE INTEREST APPLICANTS AND POLICY HOLDERS TO OBTAIN THE REASONS FOR ANY ADVERSE UNDERWRITING DECISION. WHY DO I FEEL WE HAVE A VERY COMPLICATED FIELD OF ENTERPRISE? THE SUBJECT TO AN INFORMATION LAW THE GREW OUT OF A NATIONAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. BEEN THERE FOR FORTY YEARS I WOULD NOT DISAGREE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME WAY IN WHICH YOU MIGHT IN TIME MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENT. BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE LAST TIME THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTUAL DISTRICT INSURANCE BUSINESS -- IT WAS IN. NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND WAS PROPER REPUDIATED BY THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA BY MORE THAN. TWO TO ONE I THINK INSTINCTIVELY UNDERSTAND THAT. TO SET A INSURANCE LITIGATION TARGET ON INSURANCE BUSINESS. CAN LEAD TO A GREAT DEAL EXPENSIVE WILL TRANSLATE INTO RATE. AND COST INCREASES SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY REASONABLE NOTION. THAT A LAW THAT COMES OUT OF THE NATIONAL ANY I SEE REGULATORY SYSTEM. REPRESENTS A BALLOT IN MULTIPLE INTEREST. AND IS WELL SETTLE IN FORTY YEARS BOTH WITH THAT SYSTEM BUT UNDER SARBANES OXLEY HIS FEDERAL DUTIES ON CORPORATIONS. DODD FRANK IT'S FEDERAL DUES ON CORPORATIONS. IS WORTH MAINTAINING. AND I FINALLY WANT TO NOTE THAT. IN AS MUCH OF PROP ONE OH THREE WHICH CONSUMER WATCHDOG WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ADOPTION OF SPECIFIED SIXTEEN RATING FACTOR FOR AUTO INSURANCE.TO START HAVING A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN TAKE DATA OUT OF THE SYSTEM WITHOUT EXPAND HOW YOU RECORD RECONCILE THOSE PIECES. IS ITSELF ALSO. RECKLESS WE ARE UNDER PROP ONE OH THREE THERE ARE THESE SPECIFIED RATING FACTORS YOU CANNOT HAVE OF THE RATING FACTORS YOU CAN ONLY MAKE DECISIONS. BASED ON THOSE THINGS AND SO THERE'S NO EXPLANATION OF HOW TO IN A WAY WITH DATA. RECONCILES WITH THAT INSURE OBLIGATION UNDER VOTER PASSED LAW FROM. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SO I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD BILL I THINK THE CHAIR FOR BRING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY FOR THAT HISTORY LESSON -- WE'RE GONNA MOVE -- TO MISTER CALDERON AND THEN DID. DID -- MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE ALSO OKAY WILL GO TO CALLED ON FIRST IF THAT'S OKAY AND THEN -- KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE -- YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE DID THE CCPA WAS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN WE COULDN'T TAKE A LOT OF CERTAIN THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION WAS. WAS MORE OF A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HUSTLE TO AVOID WHAT WAS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A DISASTER ON THE BALLOT -- GIVEN WHAT THE LAW -- THAT WAS PROPOSED IN HOW WAS GOING TO BE PASSED AND HOW WOULD HAVE APPLIED CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT GOING FORWARD -- FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY WE'RE VERY PROUD OF WHAT THE CZ PA HAS ACCOMPLISHED AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE. IN A WAY THAT IS TRUE -- TO PEOPLE WANTING MORE CONTROL MORE POWER OVER THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION THE AYE AYE PA AYE AYE PPA. HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THIRTY YEARS -- AND HAS BEEN DOING AN ADEQUATE JOB BUT IT BUT I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED -- BY -- THIS COMMITTEE BY YOU AS WELL AS THE PROPONENTS AND I THINK SOME OF THE YEP. OPPONENTS. IS THIS NEED TO UPDATE IT AND AND I THINK THAT -- THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IS EXISTING RIGHT NOW WITH YOU AN OFFERING THIS BILL IS TO UPDATE THE AYE AYE PPA I'M NOT SO THAT. ALL INSURANCE COMPANY SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE CZ PA WHICH REALLY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT WAS MEANT FOR A LOT OF TECH COMPANIES AND AND HOW THEY THEY USE AND SELL AND AND Là HOW TO USE. PERSONAL INFORMATION OF INDIVIDUAL CELL. WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU? WHICH IS ALREADY WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT WHAT I WOULD CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE ESPECIALLY IF THIS BILL INTO MAKING IT TO THE FLOOR -- IS THAT YOU -- CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO PROVISIONS WITHIN THE CC PA -- AND UPDATING THE I. P. P. A. AND THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL OF OF OF THIS BILL IN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE OPEN TO PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN THE C. C. PA. TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE AYE PPA -- BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT WE NEED TO MODERNIZE ALWAYS NEED TO CONTINUE TO TO TO MODERNIZE OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK SO THAT IT IS. RELEVANT IN TODAY'S DAY AND TIME I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AND SO FOR THAT I'M ALWAYS HAPPY SECOND A BILL AND I WILL BE VOTING YES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MISS KAMAGRA OF HEY I JUST HAD A QUESTION -- THAT YOU COULD -- JUST -- EXPAND ON DOES THIS BILL UNRAVELED PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE INTENT. TO MISS COM LONGER OF IN THE BIGGER PICTURE -- AS MR COOLEY EXPLAINED -- THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WHO WAS ELECTED AS HAD. A SUBSTANTIAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY NOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF OUR STATE IS ALSO ELECTED WILL HAVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY ON THE ENTIRE MASS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PART. OF PRIVACY ACT. AND ONE GOAL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THERE ARE MANY GOALS. OF THE MODERNIZATION OF THE OF A TRADITIONAL INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S. AUTHORITY TO MODERNIZE IT UPDATED AS MISTER CALDERON SAID. IS A GOAL SECONDLY TO AVOID REDUNDANCY AND ANY EFFICIENCY -- BETWEEN THOSE TWO DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WHICH HAS -- AND ENFORCEMENT STAFF AND HAS  HISTORY ALMOST FORTY YEARS ON THESE TOPICS. AND THEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO NOW HAS NEW AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT AND SO BALANCING THAT OUT I THINK IT'S A VERY LEGITIMATE. ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TO BALANCE THAT OUT TO AVOID REDUNDANCY AND INEFFICIENCIES AND CONFUSION -- THERE IS A SCENARIO THEY'LL BE TWO SETS OF REGULATIONS WHICH DON'T AGREE AND THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE BAD FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. SO THESE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE OUR STAFF HAS BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER -- AND YOU KNOW MANY BILLS WE INTRODUCE OUR FOR PURPOSES OF ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSION TO TRY TO REACH. THE BEST POSSIBLE GOALS TRY TO REACH CONSENSUS -- AS MISTER CALDERON SAID THE CCPA WAS APPROVED PRETTY. THE PARTY HASTILY LAST YEAR -- AND MANY INDUSTRIES NOW ARE ARE IN SOME SOME CHAOS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO NOW. THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. AND PRE EXISTING LAW -- AS WELL -- I HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION WITH MR MCTAGGART WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF THE INITIATIVE. THAT ENDED UP BECOMING LAW LAST AUGUST AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HIS EFFORTS AND WE HAD A VERY FRANK CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS SUBJECT. AS MISTER CALDERON SAID I THINK THE REAL FOCUS OF THE INITIATIVE WAS ON THE TECH INDUSTRY AND OTHER INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA NOT NECESSARILY INSURANCE HOWEVER INSURANCE IS A BIG INDUSTRY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE NEW REGULATIONS WORK -- FOR CONSUMERS AND WORK FOR THE MARKET PLACE AS WELL -- OCCASIONALLY THIS THIS BUILDING WILL WILL PASS A LAW THAT. TO THE CAUSES RATES TO GO UP -- AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOOD EITHER SO WE WANT A DYNAMIC MARKET PLACE WE WANT FAIRNESS. WE WANT CONSUMERS TO BE EMPOWERED. AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THESE IN THE OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR STANCE AND YOUR ONGOING PARTICIPATION WITH OUR STAFFS -- TO TRY. TO REACH THE BEST POSSIBLE GOALS HERE. THANK YOU MS COME ALIVE THANK YOU FOR I AM JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I THINK WHERE THERE ARE REGULATORY DISCREPANCIES -- BETWEEN ENTITIES LIKE THE CPA AND I I P. P. A.. N. REDUNDANCIES AND DUPLICATION INVARIABLY THE RESULT IS CHAOS FOR CONSUMERS AND I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM FROM MEMBERS. MR DAILY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AYE I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOUR CLOTHES A LITTLE BIT AGO IT WAS MORE OR LESS ANY CLOTHES BUT I WANT TO JUST AGAIN THANK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS SO.
