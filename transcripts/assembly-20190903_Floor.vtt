03:07:14.923 --> 03:07:16.625
VOLATILITY OF THIS ISSUE THERE

03:07:16.692 --> 03:07:19.494
ARE PARENTS AS WELL AS

03:07:19.561 --> 03:07:21.463
POSITIONS THAT RAISED WITH ME.

03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:23.799
THE CONCERN ABOUT. BEING

03:07:23.865 --> 03:07:26.668
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR

03:07:26.735 --> 03:07:28.637
HAVING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION OR

03:07:28.704 --> 03:07:30.539
FOR ISSUING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

03:07:30.606 --> 03:07:32.407
YOU KNOW I THINK. WE CAN

03:07:32.474 --> 03:07:35.711
IMAGINE YOU KNOW LIKE ANY OTHER

03:07:35.777 --> 03:07:40.515
DISEASE THAT. INVOLVES

03:07:40.582 --> 03:07:42.918
SENSITIVE INFORMATION SAY LIKE

03:07:42.985 --> 03:07:46.788
HIV IF THERE WAS A HIV DATABASE

03:07:46.855 --> 03:07:47.356
WITH PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

03:07:47.422 --> 03:07:52.194
INFORMATION. I THINK THERE IS A

03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:54.162
LEGITIMATE CONCERN I DON'T SEE

03:07:54.229 --> 03:07:55.430
THE REASON WHY WHAT WE'RE

03:07:55.497 --> 03:07:57.633
TRYING TO GO AFTER THE BAD

03:07:57.699 --> 03:07:59.968
ACTOR PHYSICIANS WHY DO WE NEED

03:08:00.035 --> 03:08:02.337
TO COMPILE A DATABASE OF

03:08:02.404 --> 03:08:04.773
CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS

03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:06.575
THIRTY SECONDS WAS MEANT THAT

03:08:06.642 --> 03:08:10.846
CONTAIN THAT THAT THAT NAY

03:08:10.912 --> 03:08:11.413
SUBJECT THEMSELVES THAT THEY

03:08:11.480 --> 03:08:14.650
MAY BE SUBJECT. TO UNLAWFUL OR

03:08:14.716 --> 03:08:17.085
INAPPROPRIATE ACCESS TO HACKING.

03:08:17.152 --> 03:08:19.087
BOTTOM LINE I THINK THIS BILL

03:08:19.154 --> 03:08:22.324
IS OVER BROAD IT'S THE RIGHT

03:08:22.391 --> 03:08:22.891
POLICY GOAL BUT IT'S NOT THE

03:08:22.958 --> 03:08:25.360
RIGHT SOLUTION. I ASK MY

03:08:25.427 --> 03:08:25.961
COLLEAGUES NOT TO SUPPORT THIS

03:08:26.028 --> 03:08:30.432
BILL. MR OBERNOLTE YOU ARE

03:08:30.499 --> 03:08:32.401
RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER I

03:08:32.467 --> 03:08:34.870
RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWO

03:08:34.936 --> 03:08:35.437
SEVENTY SIX I WANNA MAKE IT

03:08:35.504 --> 03:08:37.339
CLEAR I AM A FAN OF VACCINATION

03:08:37.406 --> 03:08:39.041
I BELIEVE IN VACCINATION.

03:08:39.107 --> 03:08:41.176
VACCINES ARE UNEQUIVOCALLY ONE

03:08:41.243 --> 03:08:42.511
OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF

03:08:42.577 --> 03:08:44.746
HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND THEY

03:08:44.813 --> 03:08:46.848
HAVE MADE A GREAT MEDICAL

03:08:46.915 --> 03:08:48.717
PROGRESS FOR OUR CIVILIZATION

03:08:48.784 --> 03:08:52.287
THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS. BUT. I

03:08:52.354 --> 03:08:53.255
DON'T THINK EVEN THE AUTHOR OF

03:08:53.321 --> 03:08:54.122
THIS BILL WOULD NOT ARGUE THAT

03:08:54.189 --> 03:08:55.991
VACCINES. ARE WHOLLY WITHOUT

03:08:56.058 --> 03:09:01.229
CONSEQUENCE. WHEN THE TIME CAME

03:09:01.296 --> 03:09:02.030
TO CHOOSE FOR MY OWN CHILDREN

03:09:02.097 --> 03:09:02.631
WHETHER NOT TO VACCINATE MY

03:09:02.698 --> 03:09:03.598
WIFE AND I HAD A CAREFUL

03:09:03.665 --> 03:09:05.634
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND WE

03:09:05.701 --> 03:09:07.269
DECIDED THAT VACCINATION WAS

03:09:07.335 --> 03:09:08.437
APPROPRIATE. AND I THINK THAT

03:09:08.503 --> 03:09:09.905
THAT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION.

03:09:09.971 --> 03:09:11.940
HOWEVER SOMETIMES VACCINATION

03:09:12.007 --> 03:09:14.342
HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES AND I

03:09:14.409 --> 03:09:15.510
HAD A MEETING WITH A WOMAN

03:09:15.577 --> 03:09:16.211
EARLIER THIS YEAR IN MY

03:09:16.278 --> 03:09:17.779
DISTRICT OFFICE A CONSTITUENT

03:09:17.846 --> 03:09:19.114
OF MINE WHO MADE THE DECISION

03:09:19.181 --> 03:09:22.217
OF ACTION I HER DAUGHTER. THE

03:09:22.284 --> 03:09:22.818
NEXT DAY HER DAUGHTER WOKE UP

03:09:22.884 --> 03:09:25.153
AND COULD NOT WALK. AND SHE

03:09:25.220 --> 03:09:26.555
SPENT THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IN

03:09:26.621 --> 03:09:28.256
PHYSICAL THERAPY LEARNING HOW

03:09:28.323 --> 03:09:28.724
TO WALK AGAIN THAT IS

03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:32.894
TERRIFYING. NOW I REALIZE THAT

03:09:32.961 --> 03:09:34.496
THAT HAPPENS RARELY BUT IT DOES

03:09:34.563 --> 03:09:37.032
HAPPEN. AND SO THE DECISION TO

03:09:37.099 --> 03:09:38.467
VACCINATE IS SOMETHING THAT

03:09:38.533 --> 03:09:41.103
PARENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE.

03:09:41.169 --> 03:09:43.605
THE CHOICE. THIS BILL TAKES

03:09:43.672 --> 03:09:46.675
THAT DECISION AWAY FROM PARENTS

03:09:46.742 --> 03:09:47.776
DOWN MOST CORROSIVE LEE IT

03:09:47.843 --> 03:09:49.878
SENDS THE MESSAGE TO PARENTS.

03:09:49.945 --> 03:09:51.379
THAT THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE

03:09:51.446 --> 03:09:52.581
FOR MAKING THE DECISIONS THAT

03:09:52.647 --> 03:09:53.381
INFLUENCE THE HEALTH OF THEIR

03:09:53.448 --> 03:09:54.950
CHILDREN AND WE KNOW THE

03:09:55.016 --> 03:09:58.019
PARENTS ARE THE NUMBER ONE

03:09:58.086 --> 03:09:58.887
SOURCE OF POSITIVE INFLUENCE IN

03:09:58.954 --> 03:10:00.689
OUR CHILDREN'S LIFE. WE NEED TO

03:10:00.756 --> 03:10:02.124
TRUST THEM TO MAKE THOSE

03:10:02.190 --> 03:10:03.458
DECISIONS AND IF YOU ARE

03:10:03.525 --> 03:10:05.293
WORRIED ABOUT. THE LACK OF

03:10:05.360 --> 03:10:06.528
VACCINATION AND THE LOW

03:10:06.595 --> 03:10:08.063
VACCINATION RATES IN SOME OF

03:10:08.130 --> 03:10:09.698
OUR SCHOOLS THEN I WOULD SAY WE

03:10:09.765 --> 03:10:10.732
NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB AT

03:10:10.799 --> 03:10:12.734
EDUCATING PARENTS ABOUT THE

03:10:12.801 --> 03:10:14.402
PROS AND CONS ABOUT VACCINATION

03:10:14.469 --> 03:10:15.904
ABOUT DISPELLING SOME OF THE

03:10:15.971 --> 03:10:17.005
MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT

03:10:17.072 --> 03:10:18.907
VACCINATION. AND GIVING PARENTS

03:10:18.974 --> 03:10:20.375
THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO

03:10:20.442 --> 03:10:22.210
MAKE THE APPROPRIATE DECISION

03:10:22.277 --> 03:10:26.615
THIS IS NOT THAT RIGHT TOOL I

03:10:26.681 --> 03:10:27.382
URGE A NO VOTE ON SB TWO

03:10:27.449 --> 03:10:36.024
SEVENTY SIX. DOCTOR WOULD YOU

03:10:36.091 --> 03:10:39.461

03:10:39.528 --> 03:10:40.495
MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I COME

03:10:40.562 --> 03:10:42.464
FROM A SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND.

03:10:42.531 --> 03:10:45.100
AND AS A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.

03:10:45.167 --> 03:10:45.867
AND IT'S DISTURBING TO ME THAT

03:10:45.934 --> 03:10:46.835
SOME HAVE LOST FAITH IN SCIENCE

03:10:46.902 --> 03:10:47.435
AND IN THE MAJORITY OF HEALTH

03:10:47.502 --> 03:10:51.740
CARE PROVIDERS. I KNOW SET TO

03:10:51.807 --> 03:10:53.275

THE BILL AS IT'S AMENDED I

03:10:57.746 --> 03:10:59.581
BELIEVE IT PROTECTS THE DOCTOR

03:10:59.648 --> 03:11:01.683
PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. IT

03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:03.218
PROVIDES AN APPROPRIATE PROCESS

03:11:03.285 --> 03:11:05.787
TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. FROM

03:11:05.854 --> 03:11:07.589
DOCTORS WHO ABUSE THE MEDICAL

03:11:07.656 --> 03:11:09.825
EXEMPTION PROCESS AND GIVE

03:11:09.891 --> 03:11:12.060
STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS

03:11:12.127 --> 03:11:13.361
THE TOOLS TO IDENTIFY AND

03:11:13.428 --> 03:11:15.363
PROTECT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES

03:11:15.430 --> 03:11:19.634
WHERE WE LIVE. WORK AND WORKING

03:11:19.701 --> 03:11:22.470
UNITY IMMUNITY IS AT RISK.

03:11:22.537 --> 03:11:25.173
THERE ARE LEGITIMATE MEDICAL

03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:25.740
EXEMPTIONS AND THOSE WILL BE

03:11:25.807 --> 03:11:29.110
PROTECTED IN THIS BILL. THE I

03:11:29.177 --> 03:11:33.648

03:11:37.052 --> 03:11:38.220
HAPPEN TO REPRESENT SOME

03:11:38.286 --> 03:11:40.021
COMMUNITIES WHERE THE

03:11:40.088 --> 03:11:40.622
IMMUNIZATION RATE IS VERY VERY

03:11:40.689 --> 03:11:44.125
LOW. SO WHY YOU HAVE MADE MAYBE

03:11:44.192 --> 03:11:45.894

AREAS OF THE STATE. AND THE

03:11:50.966 --> 03:11:53.768
EDUCATION PART IS A CHALLENGE.

03:11:53.835 --> 03:11:55.904
THE ASSERTION THAT VACCINES

03:11:55.971 --> 03:11:58.707
CAUSE AUTISM HAS BEEN HAS BEEN

03:11:58.773 --> 03:12:00.642
DEBUNKED. YEAH WE HEARD IN OUR

OF PARENTS WHO SIMPLY DON'T

BELIEVE THAT. WE SIMPLY HAVE

03:12:06.214 --> 03:12:09.317
LOST FAITH IN SCIENCE AND I I'M

03:12:09.384 --> 03:12:10.785
I AM DISTURB BY THAT. WHILE NO

03:12:10.852 --> 03:12:13.588

03:12:13.655 --> 03:12:14.222
BILL MAKES GREAT STRIDES IN THE

03:12:14.289 --> 03:12:17.425
RIGHT DIRECTION. WE AS MEDICAL

03:12:17.492 --> 03:12:18.627
PROVIDERS PROVIDE INFORMATION

03:12:18.693 --> 03:12:21.329
ALL THE TIME EVERY TIME I DID A

03:12:21.396 --> 03:12:22.998
PROCEDURE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:12:23.064 --> 03:12:25.333
THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT DOES

03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:26.334
HAVE THIS WILL HAVE A CHILLING

03:12:26.401 --> 03:12:29.170
EFFECT. IF YOUR MEDICAL

03:12:29.237 --> 03:12:29.771

JUST DO THIS SO THAT I YOU KNOW

03:12:40.282 --> 03:12:42.918

03:12:42.984 --> 03:12:44.286
RIGHT THING TO DO YOU'RE DOING

03:12:44.352 --> 03:12:45.287
THE RIGHT THING BY YOUR

03:12:45.353 --> 03:12:46.988
PATIENCE. YOU SHOULD HAVE NO

03:12:47.055 --> 03:12:49.124
FEAR IF THE DEPARTMENT OF

WELL. SO IT'S NOT THE END OF

03:12:54.629 --> 03:12:57.666
THE ROAD. AND THE GOAL IS THAT

03:12:57.732 --> 03:12:59.534

BIGGEST FEAR IS NOT MEASLES. MY

03:13:05.573 --> 03:13:07.275
BIGGEST FEAR IS THE NEXT THING

03:13:07.342 --> 03:13:09.010
THAT COMES ALONG MAYBE IT'S PER

03:13:09.077 --> 03:13:11.112

WHAT WHAT I FIND EXTREMELY

03:15:29.684 --> 03:15:32.554
IRONIC IS DURING THE DAYS OF

OUR OWN PERSONAL HEALTH.

03:20:05.059 --> 03:20:05.593
REACTIONS OF VACCINATIONS AND

DILIGENCE BEFORE MAKING A

03:20:13.601 --> 03:20:15.703
DECISION ABOUT VACCINATIONS

03:20:15.770 --> 03:20:17.872
EACH CHILD IS DIFFERENT.

03:20:17.939 --> 03:20:18.806
THEREFORE EACH DECISION IS

03:20:18.873 --> 03:20:20.908
DIFFERENT AS WELL. A BOARD

03:20:20.975 --> 03:20:22.143

MY CHILDREN. I SPENT HOURS

CONTRIBUTE IN A POSITIVE WAY TO

03:20:40.628 --> 03:20:43.131
SOCIETY. WHY WOULD I NOT TRY TO

03:20:43.197 --> 03:20:44.132
MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR MY

03:20:44.198 --> 03:20:45.633
CHILDREN WHY WOULD I NOT

03:20:45.700 --> 03:20:47.535
QUESTION A RESEARCH SUGGESTED

03:20:47.602 --> 03:20:49.203
BACK IN VACCINATIONS WHY WOULD

03:20:49.270 --> 03:20:51.406
NOT SEEK OUT MULTIPLE

03:20:51.472 --> 03:20:53.107
PHYSICIANS OPINIONS WHY WOULD I

03:20:53.174 --> 03:20:55.376

03:20:55.443 --> 03:20:57.145
SAY ABOUT EACH VACCINE AS A MOM

03:20:57.211 --> 03:21:00.381
I WILL ALWAYS WEIGH THE RISKS

03:21:00.448 --> 03:21:00.982
AND BENEFITS TO DECIDE WHAT IS

03:21:01.048 --> 03:21:03.785
BEST FOR MY CHILDREN. I WAS A

03:21:03.851 --> 03:21:04.685

HAD BOTH OF THESE SHOTS AT

KNOWINGLY. THAT IS OF GREAT

03:30:44.431 --> 03:30:48.068
CONCERN FOR ME. I WANT TO

03:30:48.135 --> 03:30:49.703
EMPOWER THE PARENTS I WANT TO

03:30:49.770 --> 03:30:53.440

CONTINUALLY EVALUATED IN

MONITORED THROUGH THE VACCINE

03:32:18.125 --> 03:32:26.633
DATA SAFETY. GROUP AFTER PAN I

03:32:26.700 --> 03:32:27.734
AND THEY HAVE BEEN SO IT'S NOT

03:32:27.801 --> 03:32:30.137
AS A FIFTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS

03:32:30.204 --> 03:32:32.739
A VACCINE PUT OUT WE'VE NEVER

03:32:32.806 --> 03:32:33.340
MONITORED THE SAFETY OF IT AS

03:32:33.407 --> 03:32:36.643
WELL. AGAIN THERE OVER A

03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:38.378
HUNDRED SCHOOLS. THAT DIPPED

03:32:38.445 --> 03:32:41.849
BELOW THE 90% COMMUNITY

03:32:41.915 --> 03:32:43.417
IMMUNITY RIGHT AND ONE LOWER

03:32:43.484 --> 03:32:47.421
THAN FIFTY. I WANNA BE CLEAR A

03:32:47.488 --> 03:32:50.324
CHILD THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION IS

03:32:50.390 --> 03:32:53.527
CONSIDERED VALID UNTIL IT'S NOT

03:32:53.594 --> 03:32:55.629
SO FOR A CHILD HAS A MEDICAL IN

03:32:55.696 --> 03:32:57.097
A MEDICAL EXEMPTION NO MATTER

03:32:57.164 --> 03:32:59.399
WHAT REASON IT EVEN IF IT GETS

03:32:59.466 --> 03:33:00.200
EVALUATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:33:00.267 --> 03:33:02.769
PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT CHILD GETS

03:33:02.836 --> 03:33:04.605
TO STAY IN SCHOOL ALL THE WAY

03:33:04.671 --> 03:33:05.772
THROUGH THE PROCESS EVEN APPEAL

03:33:05.839 --> 03:33:07.608
PROCESS UNTIL ITS FINAL SUCH

03:33:07.674 --> 03:33:08.942
IMPORTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:33:09.009 --> 03:33:09.877
SAYING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

03:33:09.943 --> 03:33:11.245
BACKLOG WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY

03:33:11.311 --> 03:33:12.880
ABOUT THAT THE BACKLOG IS IN

03:33:12.946 --> 03:33:16.150
FAVOR OF THE CHILD STAYING IN

03:33:16.216 --> 03:33:16.683
SCHOOL. I THINK THAT'S AN

03:33:16.750 --> 03:33:19.386
IMPORTANT FEATURE. THIS BILL.

03:33:19.453 --> 03:33:21.855
IS SPONSORED BY DOCTORS. AND

03:33:21.922 --> 03:33:23.323
IT'S SUPPORTED. BY

03:33:23.390 --> 03:33:26.460
PEDIATRICIANS. IMMUNOLOGIST

03:33:26.527 --> 03:33:28.295
ONCOLOGIST THEY ALL WANT THIS

03:33:28.362 --> 03:33:30.964
BILL. THEIR ORGANIZATIONS WANT

03:33:31.031 --> 03:33:33.167
THIS BILL. YES YOU CAN ALWAYS

03:33:33.233 --> 03:33:35.769
FIND A DOCTOR TO WHO DOESN'T

03:33:35.836 --> 03:33:36.537
BUT LET'S BE CLEAR WHO IS

03:33:36.603 --> 03:33:39.907
SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION.

03:33:39.973 --> 03:33:40.474
MOST DOCTORS WANT THE RIGHT

03:33:40.541 --> 03:33:42.276
THING TO BE DONE. AND I THINK

03:33:42.342 --> 03:33:42.876
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE TO

03:33:42.943 --> 03:33:46.713
REMEMBER. IT'S ALSO SUPPORTED

03:33:46.780 --> 03:33:48.949
BY THE MEDICAL BOARD AND I

03:33:49.016 --> 03:33:50.117
THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT

03:33:50.184 --> 03:33:50.884
BECAUSE THE MEDICAL BOARD KNOWS

03:33:50.951 --> 03:33:52.886
THAT THEY CAN'T INDIVIDUALLY GO

03:33:52.953 --> 03:33:54.021
SEEK OUT DOCTORS TO WRITING

03:33:54.087 --> 03:33:55.822
EXEMPTIONS WITHOUT PARENTS

03:33:55.889 --> 03:33:57.591
COMPLAINING THE PARENTS ARE

03:33:57.658 --> 03:33:58.492
SEEKING THESE EXEMPTION SO

03:33:58.559 --> 03:33:58.959
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A

03:33:59.026 --> 03:34:00.594
COMPLAINT. AND IT'S NOT GOING

03:34:00.661 --> 03:34:09.570
TO BE DRIVEN IN THE SAME WAY.

03:34:09.636 --> 03:34:10.170
AS FAR AS THE DATABASE I KNOW

03:34:10.237 --> 03:34:12.739
THERE IS SOME CONCERN.

03:34:12.806 --> 03:34:13.974
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DOES

03:34:14.041 --> 03:34:16.577
HAVE A DATABASE ON HIV POSITIVE

03:34:16.643 --> 03:34:18.011
PATIENTS ON STDS AND I'M

03:34:18.078 --> 03:34:20.113
CANCER. THIS ISN'T SOMETHING

03:34:20.180 --> 03:34:21.448
NEW SO I KNOW THERE WAS CONCERN

03:34:21.515 --> 03:34:23.684
BEING BROUGHT UP LIKE WHAT WE

03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:24.318
DO THIS ON OTHER DISEASES GUESS

03:34:24.384 --> 03:34:26.286
WHAT WE DO. IT'S THE DEPARTMENT

03:34:26.353 --> 03:34:27.988
OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE

03:34:28.055 --> 03:34:29.656
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO KEEP THE

03:34:29.723 --> 03:34:31.525
VAST MAJORITY OF US SAFE FROM

03:34:31.592 --> 03:34:34.228
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND TO

03:34:34.294 --> 03:34:35.862
UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT DISEASES.

03:34:35.929 --> 03:34:37.030
AS THEY COME UP. WE ALSO HAVE

03:34:37.097 --> 03:34:40.801
THE OPIOID. DATABASE AS WELL

03:34:40.867 --> 03:34:41.368
THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN

03:34:41.435 --> 03:34:45.172
THIS FOR VOTED FOR. THE

03:34:45.239 --> 03:34:46.673
INDIVIDUALS ALSO ALREADY SHARE

03:34:46.740 --> 03:34:47.975
IT WITH THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT.

03:34:48.041 --> 03:34:49.476
AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

03:34:49.543 --> 03:34:50.811
HOPEFULLY THEY REALIZE THAT

03:34:50.877 --> 03:34:52.913
INFORMATION IS ALSO HACKABLE

03:34:52.980 --> 03:34:54.948
JUST LIKE YOUR INSURANCE.

03:34:55.015 --> 03:34:56.717
DEPART COMPANIES DATABASE JUST

03:34:56.783 --> 03:34:58.719
LIKE YOUR DOCTORS DATABASE. SO

03:34:58.785 --> 03:34:59.920
I UNDERSTAND NONE OF US WHAT

03:34:59.987 --> 03:35:01.989
LIKE THAT IDEA OF OUR

03:35:02.055 --> 03:35:03.290
CHILDREN'S MEDICAL HISTORY

03:35:03.357 --> 03:35:05.092
BEING HACKABLE. BUT IT'S THERE

03:35:05.158 --> 03:35:08.295
AND IT'S ALREADY THERE. I'M NOT

03:35:08.362 --> 03:35:10.464
A DOCTOR. AND I'M GLAD THAT WE

03:35:10.530 --> 03:35:12.132
HAVE THE SUPPORT OF DOCTORS IN

03:35:12.199 --> 03:35:14.768
THE LEGISLATURE BUT I'M A MOM.

03:35:14.835 --> 03:35:16.436
AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE ALWAYS

03:35:16.503 --> 03:35:17.004
FELT SO STRONGLY ABOUT. THIS

03:35:17.070 --> 03:35:22.876
BILL. IN TWENTY TEN. WE HAD TEN

03:35:22.943 --> 03:35:24.144
DEBTS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE A

03:35:24.211 --> 03:35:28.382
WHOPPING COUGH TEN BABIES DIED.

03:35:28.448 --> 03:35:31.385
THAT THAT'S AGREED BY EVERYBODY

03:35:31.451 --> 03:35:32.719
THE DOCTORS THE PUBLIC HEALTH

03:35:32.786 --> 03:35:35.122
ADVOCATES THE AUTOPSIES THEY

03:35:35.188 --> 03:35:36.757
DIED FROM WHOOPING COUGH A

03:35:36.823 --> 03:35:40.861
PREVENTABLE DISEASE. I HAVE A

03:35:40.927 --> 03:35:42.129
PERSONAL STORY THAT I DON'T

03:35:42.195 --> 03:35:42.996
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE I

03:35:43.063 --> 03:35:44.831
DON'T WANT TO BRING UP MY

03:35:44.898 --> 03:35:45.399
FAMILY'S MEDICAL HISTORY BUT

03:35:45.465 --> 03:35:48.335
I'M GOING TO BECAUSE I. MY

03:35:48.402 --> 03:35:48.969
DAUGHTER ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT UP

03:35:49.036 --> 03:35:50.771
ON TWITTER YOU SHOULD KEEP HER

03:35:50.837 --> 03:35:53.640
CHILDREN OF TWITTER. AND SO.

03:35:53.707 --> 03:35:55.042
SHE BROUGHT IT UP IN PEOPLE

03:35:55.108 --> 03:35:56.209
START ASKING QUESTIONS ALMOST

03:35:56.276 --> 03:35:58.211
ACCUSATORY BUT I HAVE A NEPHEW

03:35:58.278 --> 03:36:00.714
WHO HAS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

03:36:00.781 --> 03:36:01.281
NOW LET ME EXPLAIN HOW THIS

03:36:01.348 --> 03:36:04.851
WORKS. I HAVE A NEPHEW THAT IS

03:36:04.918 --> 03:36:06.353
IMMUNO COMPROMISED HIS A

03:36:06.420 --> 03:36:07.988
WHITNEY A PROBLEMS IT IS

03:36:08.055 --> 03:36:09.656
PROBABLY SPENT A QUARTER OF HIS

03:36:09.723 --> 03:36:12.959
LIFE. IT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

03:36:13.026 --> 03:36:15.495
WE DEAL WITH THIS ALL THE TIME.

03:36:15.562 --> 03:36:16.863
HIS MOTHER WOULD LIKE NOTHING

03:36:16.930 --> 03:36:18.732
MORE THAN FOR HIM TO BE IMMUNE

03:36:18.799 --> 03:36:20.534
AYE IMMUNIZED AGAINST EVERY

03:36:20.600 --> 03:36:22.969
DISEASE. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

03:36:23.036 --> 03:36:25.238
HE GOT EVERY DISEASE. THIRTY

03:36:25.305 --> 03:36:26.907
SECONDS THE DOCTOR SAYS NO HE

03:36:26.973 --> 03:36:28.442
CANNOT HAVE Y. VACCINATION SO

03:36:28.508 --> 03:36:30.610
HE CAN'T BE IMMUNIZED AGAINST

03:36:30.677 --> 03:36:33.947
MEASLES OR CHICKENPOX. EVERY

03:36:34.014 --> 03:36:35.816
TIME IS NOT IN THE HOSPITAL HE

03:36:35.882 --> 03:36:36.350
WANTS TO BE AT SCHOOL. BUT

03:36:36.416 --> 03:36:40.921
THOSE DISEASES. COULD KILL HIM.

03:36:40.987 --> 03:36:41.555
DEFINITELY HE'LL END UP BACK IN

03:36:41.621 --> 03:36:44.257
THE HOSPITAL. THESE ARE THE

03:36:44.324 --> 03:36:46.326
CHILDREN THE TRULY MEDICALLY

03:36:46.393 --> 03:36:48.195
FRAGILE CHILDREN THAT WERE

03:36:48.261 --> 03:36:50.030
TRYING TO PREVENT FROM GETTING

03:36:50.097 --> 03:36:50.630
THESE DISEASES AND WHY IT'S SO

03:36:50.697 --> 03:36:53.533
IMPORTANT. I KNOW PEOPLE FEEL

03:36:53.600 --> 03:36:55.202
STRONGLY ABOUT THIS AND I KNOW

03:36:55.268 --> 03:36:56.837
ALL THE OPPOSITION IS JUST

03:36:56.903 --> 03:36:57.437
ABOUT LOVING YOUR CHILDREN. I

03:36:57.504 --> 03:36:59.306
HAVE NO DOUBT OF THAT. A LOT OF

03:36:59.373 --> 03:37:02.409
US ARE MAMA BEARS. BUT BEING A

03:37:02.476 --> 03:37:04.211
MAMA BEAR MEANS PROTECTING

03:37:04.277 --> 03:37:05.278
THOSE KIDS WHO NEED THE

03:37:05.345 --> 03:37:06.980
PROTECTION THE MOST. I
