FOR IT SB. FIVE TWELVE FOR AS

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:16.275
FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER.

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:17.710
I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT WORKING

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:20.046
FULL TIME AND KEEPING MY LONG

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.714
TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES WOULD

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:23.816
JUST NOT BE POSSIBLE.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:25.184
INSTEAD OF JUST ACCEPTING THAT

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.053
IS FACT I DECIDED TO CHALLENGE

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.221
IT.

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:30.056
I WANTED TO COME HOME AT NIGHT

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.624
KNOWING THAT I SPENT MY DAY NOT

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.025
ONLY DOING MY PART IN

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:34.360
CONTRIBUTING AND GIVING BACK TO

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:35.561
MY COMMUNITIES.

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:37.163
BUT I DID MY PART AS AN AMERICAN

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.265
TAXPAYER WHO COULD CONTRIBUTE TO

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:40.500
MY COUNTRY.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.001
A FEW YEARS BACK WHAT I HAD

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.970
ALWAYS DREAMED BECAME A REALITY

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:45.571
WHEN I WAS OFFERED MY VERY FIRST

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.740
INTERNSHIP.

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:49.308
THAT INTERNSHIP TURNED INTO A

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.043
PART TIME JOB.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.246
AND EVENTUALLY AFTER HARD WORK.

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.281
MY FULL TIME MY PART TIME JOB

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:59.652
TURNED INTO A FULL TIME -- JOB.

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:00.586
THAT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:02.021
DECISION TO MAKE TO ACCEPT THAT

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.122
JOB.

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.290
BECAUSE I KNEW THERE WAS AN

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:06.225
INCOME THRESHOLD. TO WHAT I

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.927
COULD EARN IN ORDER TO KEEP MY

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:10.630
LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.431
NONE THE LESS I DECIDED TO

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:14.834
PERSEVERE AND MOVE FORWARD.

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.569
ALWAYS MAKING SURE THAT I NEVER

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.671
HAD THAT INCOME LIMIT AS TO PUT

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.273
MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.576
SERVICES AT RISK.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:26.746
BUT BUT IN DECEMBER OF TWO

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:27.313
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MY FATHER

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.214
PASSED AWAY.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.316
AND I BEGAN TO RECEIVE SOME OF

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:32.652
HIS BENEFITS.

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:33.519
THIS MEANT THAT I COULD NO

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:36.122
LONGER KEEP MY EARNED INCOME.

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:37.990
AND MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.025
SERVICES.

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.494
SO I WAS FACED WITH THE CHOICE.

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.029
TO EITHER KEEP MY HEALTH CARE

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:44.530
AND MY PERSONAL CARE ATTENDANTS

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.566
THAT ENABLES ME TO LIVE

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.167
INDEPENDENTLY.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.535
OR TO QUIT MY JOB.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:52.171
A JOB THAT I HAD WORKED SO HARD.

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:53.639
FOR A JOB WHERE I WAS GROWING MY

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:55.241
SKILLS IN.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.676
AND HAD THE WHERE I HAD BUILT MY

00:07:56.742 --> 00:08:00.079
COMMUNITY AND MY NETWORK THROUGH.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.180
I THOUGHT ROB THAT I WAS FORCED

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:03.349
TO BE DUG GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.750
I ALSO FELT DISAPPOINTED THAT I

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:05.952
WAS GOING TO REMAIN ON THE

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.820
SYSTEM.

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:09.155
BUT SINCE THERE'S NO WAY I CAN

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:11.290
AFFORD OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:12.625
MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:15.027
SERVICES ON MY EARNED INCOME

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:16.195
ALONE.

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:18.197
I DID QUIT MY JOB.

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:19.999
SO THAT I CAN MAINTAIN LIVING AT

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:22.568
HOME AND LIVING INDEPENDENTLY.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:23.870
I AM NOT ALONE.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.071
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WITH

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.039

WHETHER WE CHOOSE TO PURSUE JOBS

THAT WE NEED TO LIVE

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.253
INDEPENDENTLY.

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:42.054
THIS DECISION IS NOT FAIR AND IT

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.156
IS ALWAYS PLACED ON PEOPLE WITH

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:46.158

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:35.279
GIVES THEM THE OPTION.

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:37.281
HI THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT I

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:39.216
RAN ON IN MY CAMPAIGN I TOOK NO

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:40.150

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:51.295
AND AFTER ALL THAT WORK THAT WE

00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:52.496
DID TO KEEP IT HERE FROM ALL

00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:54.264
SIDES OF THE ISSUE WE CAME TO

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:55.232
THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE SHOULD

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:56.566
AT LEAST BE AN OPTION.

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:57.801
IF THIS LITIGATION AND THIS

00:48:57.868 --> 00:48:59.469

THEIR ANSWER IS WE CAN'T DO IT

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:20.991

I'VE LEARNED WITH -- HP THAT

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:02.165
DOING AWAY TO BE ISSUES IS

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.900
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN DOING THE DOG

MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL BOILS

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.680
DOWN TO THIS [inaudible]

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:19.949
NOBODY.

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:21.484
WHO KNOWS SENATOR GLAZER WOULD

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:22.986
BELIEVE THAT HE DOES A BILL THAT

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:23.853
DOESN'T DO SOMETHING OF

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.221
SUBSTANCE?

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.789
HE'S A QUALITY LEGISLATOR WHO

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:27.957
DOES A GREAT JOB WITH THIS

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:30.093
CONSTITUENTS AND IT'S REFLECTED

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:32.228
IN THE ARTICLE THAT COMES OUT

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.696
AFTER THE LAST BILL IN WHICH THE

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:34.697
HEADLINE SAYS.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.266
TESLA PARK SALE APPROVED BY

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:40.470
STATE SENATE COMMITTEE SB SEVEN

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:41.137
SIXTY SEVEN A MEASURE THAT WOULD

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:43.506
ALLOW THE STATE TO SELL CARNEGIE

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:46.609
STATE VEHICULAR RECREATION AREA.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:49.112
FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:50.279
CLEARED ITS FIRST HEARING.

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:51.681
AND FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S THE

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:53.116
PROBLEM WITH THE BILL THE BILL

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:55.418
ITSELF.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.986
I AGREE WE NEED A SOLUTION.

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:58.554
WE NEED A SOLUTION BECAUSE IT'S

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.023
GONE ON TOO LONG.

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.791
HOWEVER THE BILL ONLY GIVES ONE

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.960
SOLUTION IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:05.728
JUDGE ROY BEAN THING YOU KNOW

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:06.863
WE'RE GONNA DO A HEARING ON EACH

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.664
OF FAIR HEARING ON A WAY TO BE

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:09.298
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET RID OF

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.333
IT.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.035
THE BILL DOESN'T SAY WHAT

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:14.003
HAPPENS IF WE DO THESE HEARINGS

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.738
AND IT TURNS OUT.

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.640
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DID

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.709
EVERYTHING CORRECTLY.

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.544
THIS IS NOT STE LOCAL THIS IS

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.112
NOT A LOCAL ISSUE THIS IS AN

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.914
AREA IN WHICH MOTORCYCLES WERE

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:25.948
WRITTEN ON IT.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.450
THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH STATE

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:30.086
PARKS DID PUBLIC HEARINGS.

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:31.821
THIS IS AN ISSUE WHICH THE STATE

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.256
PARKS DID EVERYTHING THEY WERE

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:35.391
SUPPOSED TO DO TO REACH THE

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:37.927
POINT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:39.328
AND WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT THEY

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:40.830
DID DO EVERYTHING CORRECTLY THEN

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.865
THE BILL SHOULD SAY THAT WE WILL

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:45.268
EXPEDITE THE USE OF THIS

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:48.371
PROPERTY -- FOR HD PURPOSES OF

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.506
CLOSE BY SAYING THERE TO MORE

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.108
THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARKS.

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:54.010
OF STATE PARKS IN CALIFORNIA

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.611
ONLY EIGHT OF THEM.

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:56.979
DEAL WITH OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.047
RECREATION.

01:01:58.114 --> 01:01:59.782
THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH EVEN

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:02.185
THOSE WHO STAND UP IN OPPOSITION

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.519
WERE APPROACHED AND WERE GIVEN

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.588
THE ABILITY TO SPEAK ON THIS

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.290
ISSUE IN THE PARKS DECIDED.

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:56.990
THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF

01:54:57.056 --> 01:54:58.625
CAN'T SORT OF GRANULARITY IN THE

01:54:58.691 --> 01:55:02.028
MEASURE RIGHT NOW I'M VERY OPEN --

01:55:02.095 --> 01:55:04.464
TO IDEAS ON EITHER EXPANDING TO

01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:05.632
MULTIPLESECTORS AND GETTING

01:55:05.698 --> 01:55:08.635
REALLY SPECIFIC -- AND INTENSELY

01:55:08.701 --> 01:55:10.236
EVEN EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THE

01:55:10.303 --> 01:55:12.705
BOARD ALTHOUGH YOU GET INTO A A

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:13.673
PLACE FOR YOU KNOW DECISION

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:14.841
MAKING GETS COMPLICATED

01:55:14.907 --> 01:55:16.809
DEPENDING ON HOW BIG IT GETS.

01:55:16.876 --> 01:55:19.879
BUT IT'S IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:20.713
ONE PRIVATE SECTOR MEMBER OR

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.148
WHAT ONE SECTOR OF THE LABOR

01:55:22.215 --> 01:55:23.850
ECONOMY FRANKLY A TEAMSTERS

01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:25.118
GONNA HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

01:55:25.184 --> 01:55:27.287
INTERESTS THAN SAY A NURSE OR A

01:55:27.353 --> 01:55:29.555
OR A LONGSHOREMANRIGHT SO.

01:55:29.622 --> 01:55:30.890
I THINK WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO TRY

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:32.191
TO FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE THIS

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:33.893
WORK THAT WE CAN COVER THOSE

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.662
MULTIPLE SECTORS AYE AYE IT'S A

01:55:35.728 --> 01:55:36.763
VALID CONCERN.

01:55:36.829 --> 01:55:38.564
AND I'M I'M OPEN TO IDEAS OKAY

01:55:38.631 --> 01:55:39.899
SO YOUR VISION IS TO HAVE MORE

01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:41.100
THAN ONE PERSON FROM THE PRIVATE

01:55:41.167 --> 01:55:42.735
SECTOR BUT YOU'RE INCLUDING IN

01:55:42.802 --> 01:55:43.836

KNOW.

01:55:49.475 --> 01:55:50.943
MOST EMPLOYEES STILL IN

01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:53.246
CALIFORNIA WORK FOR IN THE

01:55:53.313 --> 01:55:54.447
PRIVATE SECTOR AND THAT'S A

01:55:54.514 --> 01:55:55.782
LARGE MARGIN I WOULD.

01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:57.083
JUST ENCOURAGES IT MOVES DOWN

01:55:57.150 --> 01:55:57.950
THE ROAD TO MAYBE.

01:55:58.017 --> 01:56:05.325

BILL -- IT THERE SEEMS TO BE A

01:56:13.466 --> 01:56:14.600
LOT OF FEAR REGARDING AUTOMATION

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:15.668
AND I'VE BEEN.

01:56:15.735 --> 01:56:16.569

01:56:22.642 --> 01:56:23.910
TECHNOLOGY NOT JUST THE

01:56:23.976 --> 01:56:25.645
CONSUMERS I THINK WE NEED TO

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:28.514

NEED TO ADDRESS SO THAT WE CAN

01:56:45.798 --> 01:56:49.736

DICK TRACY APPEAR -- IN A THAT'S

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:30.736
A VERY NON MILLENNIAL REFERENCE

01:58:30.803 --> 01:58:32.205
SO I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE

01:58:32.271 --> 01:58:36.142
ANACHRONISTIC AYE YEAH -- THIS

01:58:36.209 --> 01:58:38.377
BILL IS ABOUT.

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:40.480
ANOTHER CHALLENGING ISSUE IN THE

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:42.248
TECHNOLOGY SPACE WHICH GOES

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:43.783
BEYOND JUST THE FUTURE OF WORK

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:45.585
IN WHAT AUTOMATION COULD DO TO

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:46.719
OUR WORK FORCE IN THE STATE OF

01:58:46.786 --> 01:58:50.556
CALIFORNIA BUT THE SPEED OF

01:58:50.623 --> 01:58:52.925
INNOVATION WHEN IT COMES TO

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:55.194
CHANGES IN SOCIAL MEDIA -- AND

01:58:55.261 --> 01:58:57.630
OUR BROADER TECHNOLOGY LANDSCAPE.

01:58:57.697 --> 01:59:01.167
WE FEEL IS OUTPACING OUR ABILITY

01:59:01.234 --> 01:59:02.435
TO TO TO NOT JUST TO REGULATE

01:59:02.502 --> 01:59:04.570
BUT TO TRULY COMPREHEND IS

01:59:04.637 --> 01:59:05.771
PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS AND HIS

01:59:05.838 --> 01:59:11.577
GOVERNMENT -- THE THE IMPACT OF

01:59:11.644 --> 01:59:13.613
BROADLY PROLIFERATED SOCIAL

01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:16.816
MEDIA ON OUR DEMOCRACY.

01:59:16.883 --> 01:59:19.585
ON OUR PUBLIC HEALTH -- ON THE

01:59:19.652 --> 01:59:21.821
WAY WE GO ABOUT OUR DAILY LIVES

01:59:21.888 --> 01:59:22.455
I DON'T THINK IS FULLY

01:59:22.522 --> 01:59:24.056
UNDERSTOOD I KNOW WE WILL BE

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:25.391
WRESTLING WITH MANY ISSUES

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:27.460
AROUND PRIVACY -- AND HOW

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:29.695
CONSUMERS INTERACT WITH --

01:59:29.762 --> 01:59:30.830
THEY'RE SORT OF THESE DATA

01:59:30.897 --> 01:59:32.899
PLATFORMS THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT

01:59:32.965 --> 01:59:33.666
IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE A

01:59:33.733 --> 01:59:36.936
CONCEPT OF A DATED DIVIDENDS --

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:39.205
THIS BILL TRIES TO SORT OF SCOPE

01:59:39.272 --> 01:59:40.840
OUT A BROADER APPROACH WHERE

01:59:40.907 --> 01:59:42.909
CALIFORNIA MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET

01:59:42.975 --> 01:59:44.744
A BETTER SENSE.

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:47.313
OF WHAT THE TRUE IMPACTS OF THE

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:49.582
SPEED AND SCALE OF INNOVATION

01:59:49.649 --> 01:59:51.417
ARE THAT WE'VE SEEN.

01:59:51.484 --> 01:59:53.486
AS A SOCIAL MATTER SO NOT JUST

01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:55.821
IMPACTS ON WORKFORCE.

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:58.124
BUT TRULY THE IMPACT ON OUR

01:59:58.190 --> 02:00:00.660
LIVES ON THE VALUE OF THE DATA

02:00:00.726 --> 02:00:03.396
THAT WERE SENDING -- TO THE

02:00:03.462 --> 02:00:04.964
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES THAT ARE

02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:08.000
BEING UTILIZED TO TARGET ADS OR

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:09.168
TO GENERATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:12.438
IN REVENUE -- WHAT'S HAPPENING.

02:00:12.505 --> 02:00:15.374
TO YOUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS AS

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:17.910
THEY USE INSTAGRAM FOR NINETEEN

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:19.912
HOURS A DAY AND LIVE THEIR LIVES

02:00:19.979 --> 02:00:21.914
IN THIS PARADIGM THAT IS TRULY

02:00:21.981 --> 02:00:24.050
IMPACTING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH

02:00:24.116 --> 02:00:27.153
ONE ANOTHER -- AS WELL AS WITH

02:00:27.219 --> 02:00:29.188
DEMOCRACY -- NOT JUST A YOUNG

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:31.357
PERSON ISSUE THOUGH FAKE NEWS

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:33.726
LAST CYCLE I THINK THE VAST

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.695
MAJORITY WAS SHARED BY THOSE

02:00:35.761 --> 02:00:36.729
SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER.

02:00:36.796 --> 02:00:38.764
HI THIS IS NOT JUST MILLENNIALS

02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:39.599
IGNORANTLY WANDERING THROUGH THE

02:00:39.665 --> 02:00:40.433
WEB.

02:00:40.499 --> 02:00:41.968
SO THE GUY IDEA HERE IS TO FORM

02:00:42.034 --> 02:00:43.836
SOME KIND OF COMMISSION TO BRING

02:00:43.903 --> 02:00:46.906
BOTH -- THE TOP ACADEMICS -- THE

02:00:46.973 --> 02:00:49.008
TOP ECONOMISTS FOLKS FROM

02:00:49.075 --> 02:00:51.410
PRIVATE SECTOR BUT ALSO CONSUMER

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:52.979
AND PRIVACY ADVOCATES TO TRY TO

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:54.747
DEVELOP SOME STRATEGY TO LOOK AT

02:00:54.814 --> 02:00:56.515
WHAT AN EQUITY STAKE FROM THE

02:00:56.582 --> 02:00:57.984
TECH COMMUNITY REALLY LOOKS LIKE.

02:00:58.050 --> 02:00:59.885
IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO JUST

02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:00.820
SAY.

02:01:00.886 --> 02:01:02.622
YOU CAN OFFSET THE IMPACT YOU

02:01:02.688 --> 02:01:04.357
MAY HAVE HAD ON JOURNALISM ON

02:01:04.423 --> 02:01:05.291
DEMOCRACY THROUGH CHARITABLE

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:07.293
CONTRIBUTIONS OR THROUGH SOME

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.895
OTHER -- STUDIES ARE REPORTS SIR

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:11.364
EVEN THE WONDERFUL EVENTS WE DO

02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:13.566
OUR WE WE CODE IN THE DISTRICTS

02:01:13.633 --> 02:01:15.601
ARE WE HELP EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE

02:01:15.668 --> 02:01:18.204
ABOUT -- THE THE PITFALLS OF

02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:20.172
SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S THAT'S NOT

02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:22.875
ENOUGH -- WE ACTUALLY NEED TO

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.110
LOOK AT A SITTING DOWN THE TECH

02:01:24.176 --> 02:01:25.645
COMMUNITY WHAT AN EQUITY STAKE

02:01:25.711 --> 02:01:27.213
REALLY LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:28.414
ANYTHING THAT STARTS WITH

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:30.516
ACCOUNTING DATA AND HAVE AN

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:32.284
ACCURATE SET OF FACTS ABOUT.

02:01:32.351 --> 02:01:33.686
WHAT THESE IMPACTS COULD TRULY

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:35.354
BE SO -- THIS IS SORT OF TAKING

02:01:35.421 --> 02:01:36.756
THAT BALL AND RUNNING WITH IT

02:01:36.822 --> 02:01:38.190
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF THE

02:01:38.257 --> 02:01:40.126
STATE AND TRY TO EXPAND UPON

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:41.794
THAT TO NOT JUST BE ABOUT A DATA

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:43.429
DIVIDEND CONVERSATION BUT

02:01:43.496 --> 02:01:44.263
SOMETHING MUCH BROADER THAT WE

02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:45.731
THINK COULD.

02:01:45.798 --> 02:01:48.334
TRY PUBLIC POLICY IN YEARS TO

02:01:48.401 --> 02:01:49.669
COME.

02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:50.803
I'VE GOT HERE THIS BUSY UGLIES

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:51.837
HERE FROM COMMON SENSE MEDIA

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:52.705
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY

02:01:52.772 --> 02:01:53.606
AND HELPING US ALONG WITH THIS

AND I QUOTE.

02:02:39.452 --> 02:02:40.720

02:02:47.093 --> 02:02:48.694
THAT IS MORALLY INDEFENSIBLE IT

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:49.862
IS GOOD COP OUT AND IS HURTING

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:51.897

CONTINUED IN THOSE COMMENTS.

02:03:09.615 --> 02:03:10.850
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS ASK

02:03:10.916 --> 02:03:12.852
OURSELVES WHAT THE IMPACT OF OUR

02:03:12.918 --> 02:03:15.054

THIS WORK WILL HAPPEN BY

02:04:17.917 --> 02:04:19.552
ENGAGING COMMUNITIES IN SECTORS

02:04:19.618 --> 02:04:21.086
THAT ARE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE AND

02:04:21.153 --> 02:04:22.621
THAT HAVE AN WITH THOSE THAT

02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:24.490
HAVE THE MOST AT STAKE WE LOOK

THANK YOU WELL I THINK THIS IS A

02:04:41.907 --> 02:04:43.742
REALLY IMPORTANT STAFFED I AS AN

EDUCATOR FOR SO MANY YEARS I CAN

02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:46.679
TELL YOU THAT DOWN.

02:04:46.745 --> 02:04:48.280
THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES AS

02:04:48.347 --> 02:04:49.715
TEACHERS ON NOT GOING UP IN THE

02:04:49.782 --> 02:04:50.883
TECHNOLOGY ERA THERE WERE NOT

02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:52.451
UNDERSTANDING IN THE CLASSROOM

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:55.120
THE IMPACTS OF PARENT TEACHER.

02:04:55.187 --> 02:04:56.322
ANYHOW I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

02:04:56.388 --> 02:04:57.389
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WITH THIS IS

02:04:57.456 --> 02:04:59.391
IMPORTANT IN PARTICULAR AS IT

02:04:59.458 --> 02:05:00.860
PERTAINS TO OUR STUDENTS AND

02:05:00.926 --> 02:05:02.027
WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SO

02:05:02.094 --> 02:05:03.429
HOPEFULLY WE GET SOME DATA ON

02:05:03.495 --> 02:05:04.430
HOW THAT AFFECTS.

02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:07.333
OUR CHILDREN IN THE CLASSROOM

02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:07.600
THANK YOU.

02:05:07.666 --> 02:05:08.767
THANK YOU.

02:05:08.834 --> 02:05:11.270
SO RUBIO CAN I COUNT THAT AS A

02:05:11.337 --> 02:05:14.640
OCEAN [inaudible]

02:05:14.707 --> 02:05:17.509
SIR WORKS.

02:05:17.576 --> 02:05:19.678
WE'RE USING THE THE TERM

02:05:19.745 --> 02:05:23.015
EQUITIES AND INEQUITIES.

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:24.283
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT?

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:27.419
DOES THAT MEAN.

02:05:27.486 --> 02:05:29.655
I WE IS THIS A SYNONYM FOR

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:30.522
TAXATION.

02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:33.058
RESEARCH.

02:05:33.125 --> 02:05:34.526
I DO I DON'T THINK SO I I I

02:05:34.593 --> 02:05:36.228
THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:05:36.295 --> 02:05:38.864
WAYS THAT TECHNOLOGY AND THE

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:40.666
INDUSTRY'S DRIVING IT -- CAN

02:05:40.733 --> 02:05:42.701
TAKE AN EQUITY STAKE IN THE

02:05:42.768 --> 02:05:44.737
CONVERSATION I THINK IT STARTS

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:47.139
WITH ACCOUNTING -- AND SORT OF

02:05:47.206 --> 02:05:48.574
UNDERSTANDING.

02:05:48.641 --> 02:05:51.110
THE IF IT'S POSSIBLE WE WE MAY

02:05:51.176 --> 02:05:53.012
NOT GET TO A PERFECT ACCOUNTING

02:05:53.078 --> 02:05:55.481
OF SOCIAL COST HERE -- IT'S NOT

02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:57.716
THE SAME SAY IS A CARBON PRICING

02:05:57.783 --> 02:05:59.351
EXERCISE WHERE YOU CAN.

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:02.121
GET DOWN TO THE EXACT DOLLAR PER

02:06:02.187 --> 02:06:03.455
TON EQUIVALENT.

02:06:03.522 --> 02:06:06.425
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:08.460
TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY YET FULLY

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:11.330
UNDERSTANDS THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:13.232
SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM US BUT

02:06:13.299 --> 02:06:14.967
THEY ARE US AND I GUESS THAT'S

02:06:15.034 --> 02:06:16.902
THAT'S THE MEANING BEHIND THE

02:06:16.969 --> 02:06:19.605
EQUITY POINT IS THAT -- HEY

02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:21.173
THEY DON'T EXIST JUST IN THE

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:22.908
CLOUD THEY'RE NOT JUST A

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:25.477
PLATFORM -- THEY'RE HERE IN THE

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:27.746
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:06:27.813 --> 02:06:28.681
THEY LIVE HERE.

02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:31.951
HOUSING THE WORK FORCE -- THEY

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:33.686
OUGHT TO EXERCISE SOME EQUITY

02:06:33.752 --> 02:06:36.722
STAKE IN WHAT THAT IS AND NOW

02:06:36.789 --> 02:06:38.057
I'M I DON'T THINK THIS IS

02:06:38.123 --> 02:06:40.326
SUPPOSED TO BE -- TAXATION

02:06:40.392 --> 02:06:42.928
ORIENTED MEASURE PER SE -- I

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:44.430
THINK THAT IT'S A IT'S A BROADER

02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:46.498
FRAMEWORK TO ALLOW OURSELVES

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:48.667
ACTUALLY INTEGRATE -- THOSE

02:06:48.734 --> 02:06:50.936
COMMUNITIES IMPACTS INTO OUR

02:06:51.003 --> 02:06:53.305
FUTURE PLANNING OF WE KNOW THAT

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:55.140
THE 85% OF FAKE NEWS ARE BEING

02:06:55.207 --> 02:06:56.909
SHARED BY THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:58.110
OLDER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:06:58.177 --> 02:06:59.745
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING.

02:06:59.812 --> 02:07:01.680
EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS ON THOSE

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:03.716
COMMUNITIES AGAIN I THINK A LOT

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:05.351
OF FEAR DRIVES OUR CONVERSATION

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:07.519
AROUND TECH AND THAT SORT OF THE

02:07:07.586 --> 02:07:10.522
RELATION BACK TO THE FUTURE WORK --

02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:13.559
WE ARE SPECULATING RIGHT NOW AND

02:07:13.625 --> 02:07:15.995
A LOT OF THE BLOW UPS THAT WE

02:07:16.061 --> 02:07:17.963
SEEN OVER LAST COUPLE YEARS IN

02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:19.531
TERMS OF THE USE OF FACEBOOK --

02:07:19.598 --> 02:07:21.967
IT'S IMPACT ON JOURNALISM -- I

02:07:22.034 --> 02:07:23.202
STILL BELIEVE IN A FREE AND OPEN

02:07:23.268 --> 02:07:24.169
INTERNET AND I DON'T THINK THE

02:07:24.236 --> 02:07:26.171
ANSWER TO THIS IS TO SHUT DOWN

02:07:26.238 --> 02:07:31.710
FACEBOOK OR TO GO -- TAX GOOGLE

02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:33.412
BECAUSE THE CURRENT PARADIGM IS

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:35.547
SIMPLY NOT WORKING.

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:37.249
IN I THINK YOU'RE HITTING ON

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:38.684
SOME REALLY IMPORTANT POINTS I

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:40.686
THINK.

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:42.721
THE TECH DYNAMIC IN ITS EVERYDAY

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:45.057
IMPACT OUR LIVES WERE CERTAINLY

02:07:45.124 --> 02:07:47.960
HAVING TO CALIBRATE RECALIBRATE --

02:07:48.027 --> 02:07:49.094
AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO END IN

02:07:49.161 --> 02:07:50.429
SIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS A STEP

02:07:50.496 --> 02:07:51.897
OR TWO AHEAD OF US.

02:07:51.964 --> 02:07:53.098
I'M JUST WONDERING DO YOU HAVE

02:07:53.165 --> 02:07:55.200
ANY CONCERN BY THE CREATION OF A

02:07:55.267 --> 02:07:57.469
COMMISSION LIKE THIS.

02:07:57.536 --> 02:07:57.669
THAT.

02:07:57.736 --> 02:07:59.638
IT WOULD.

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:01.673
THE FIRST A CALCULATION ON

02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:02.908
IMPACT.

02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:05.177
AND THE MOTIVATION TO CREATE NEW

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:06.912
FUNDING STREAMS WILL BE SO

02:08:06.979 --> 02:08:10.549
OVERWHELMING IN SEDUCTIVE.

02:08:10.616 --> 02:08:11.383
THAT.

02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:14.586
IT'S AN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS --

02:08:14.653 --> 02:08:16.655
WITH ITS OWN CONCLUSION.

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:17.823
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE

02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:21.060
OUT OF THE FUTURE OF THIS AREA

02:08:21.126 --> 02:08:22.661
OF REGULATION AND I AND I THINK
