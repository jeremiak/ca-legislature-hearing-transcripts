WELCOME. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'LL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. WE HAVE. A NUMBER OF RESOLUTIONS TO BE HEARD TODAY SO WE'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER TWO AJ ARE. FORTY TWO GREAT HANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE AJ ARE FORTY TWO A RESOLUTION DECLARING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TITLE TEN PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. AND URGENT OPPOSITION TO THE RECENTLY PROPOSED GAG RULE WHICH WOULD AFFECT TITLE TEN PROVIDERS. ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THIS PROGRAM SERVES FOUR MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR. IT IS THE NATION'S PROGRAM FOR AFFORDABLE BIRTH CONTROL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. THE PROGRAM IS AND HAS BEEN AVAILABLE TO HELP ENSURE THAT EVERY WOMAN EVERY PERSON REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE. THEIR INCOME OR BACKGROUND OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE INSURED HAS ACCESS A BASIC HEALTH CARE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. INCLUDING BIRTH CONTROL CANCER SCREENINGS STD TESTING AND TREATMENT [inaudible] IN CALIFORNIA. TITLE TEN PROVIDERS. REPRESENT 25%. OF THE PATIENTS NATIONWIDE ARE LET ME REPHRASE THAT TITLE TEN PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA SERVE TITLE TEN PATIENTS NATIONWIDE. THAT IS ONE MILLION PATIENTS WHO ARE SERVED BY PROVIDERS IN OUR STATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO CENSOR. THROUGH THIS PROPOSED TITLE TEN GAG RULE. SO TO FURTHER EXPLAIN THIS THREAT TO CARE IN OUR STATE I AM JOINED BY ANDREA SAN MIGUEL WHO IS OUR PUBLIC POLICY ADVOCATE FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU WITNESS PLEASE THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AGAIN MY NAME'S ANDREAS TO ME ON THE POLICY ADVOCATE FOR P. PAKA REPRESENTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN HEALTH CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- ALONG WITH OTHER TYPES OF CLINICS AND PROVIDERS PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEALTH CENTERS MAKE UP A LARGE PORTION OF THE TITLE TO NETWORK THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AS HE SOMEONE WOMAN MENTIONS I TELL TIMES CREATED IN -- NINETEEN SEVENTY AND ALL OF THE BASIC SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED -- SINCE THEN THROUGH THIS PROGRAM INCLUDING -- PREVENTION SERVICES HAVE LET -- THE UNITED STATES IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A THIRTY YEAR LOW FOR UNPLANNED PREGNANCY. AND A HISTORICAL LOW FOR TEEN PREGNANCY THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THESE TYPES OF PREVENTION SERVICES -- BASED ON ITS SUCCESS TITLE TEN HAS HAD WIDESPREAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT -- FOR DECADES YET DESPITE THESE OUTCOMES AYE AND HOW MANY LOW INCOME PATIENTS RELY ON SUCH SERVICES THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION DID PROPOSE A TITLE TEN GAG RULE -- EARLIER THIS YEAR THIS RULE WOULD PROHIBIT CLINICIANS -- SO DOCTORS NURSES ANYONE -- REALLY WHO WOULD BE -- GIVING CONSULTATION -- ON THEIR OPTIONS TO OUR PATIENTS FROM GIVING REFERRALS TO PATIENTS ABOUT ABORTION OR EVEN TALKING ABOUT ABORTIONWITH THEIR PATIENTS -- WHICH WOULD PREVENT THESE PATIENTS FROM GETTING FULL AND HONEST MEDICAL INFORMATION FROM THE DOCTORS AND NURSES THAT THEY TRUST. THIS RULE BUILDS A WALL BETWEEN MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. AS NOTED IN OUR WRITTEN COMMENTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION -- THE IMPACT OF THIS RULE WOULD BE MOST DEVASTATING FOR LOW INCOME PATIENTS WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ALREADY FACE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HEALTH CARE INCLUDING PREVENTION CARE. THIS IS AN IRRESPONSIBLE PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS WHY THEY WERE MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND COMMENTS OF OPPOSITION. THE CAME FROM CALIFORNIA ALONE. AND WE WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE FOR THE COMMENTS PROVIDED BY PRO TEM UM ATKINS AND SPEAKER RENDON AS WELL AS SUB SEVERAL OTHER LEADERS IN THE LEGISLATURE -- AND SO TODAY WE URGE YOUR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT -- FOR AJ ARE.

THAT WE HAVE SEEN COMING FROM THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION -- AND THE CONTINUED ATTACK ON WOMEN AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE WILL TAKE THIS UP WHEN WE GET A POOR [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] MISS RUBIO. FOR THE REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR I'M PULLING ITEM NUMBER SIX HR. ONE THIRTEEN AUTHOR OF THE CONSENT TO GENDER SO THEY COULD BE HEARD. SINCE THIS WAS ON INCENTIVES NOT GONNA HAVE ANY. PROBLEMS GETTING THROUGH SO I'D APPRECIATE IF YOU'D BE BRIEF I DO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT HR ONE THIRTEEN KNOWN AS PICKY AS RESOLUTION TO COME OUT COMMANDMENT COMMEMORATE THE LIFE OF PEAKY AND MANY CHILDREN LIKE HIM. WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES AT THE HANDS OF AN UNFIT PARENT OR THOSE WITH RIGHT TO CUSTODY AND TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANT THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILD SAFETY CUSTODY DISPUTES? AND MEDIATION. ON APRIL TWENTY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN VICKI DISAPPEARED AFTER A TRIP TO DISNEYLAND. WELL UNDER THE CARE OF HIS FATHER. WHO HAVE BEEN AWARDED UNSUPERVISED VISITATIONS DURING A LONG ONGOING CUSTODIAL DISPUTE? MONTH MONTHS AFTER PEAK IT'S HIS APPEARANCE AND INTENSE INVESTIGATIVE WORK DETECTIVE APPREHENDED BECAUSE FATHER. AS THE MAIN SUBJECT WHO LATER CONFESSED TO MERCK MURDERING HIS OWN CHILD. AND DISCLOSE THE WHEREABOUTS OF HIS REMAINS. DURING THE CUSTODIAL DISPUTE. THE FAMILY COURT SYSTEM REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO GIVE AYE MUSCLE CUSTODY. DESPITE MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT THE KEY WAS IN DANGER. I'M NOT FOUGHT FOR HER SON. THE DOCUMENT THE DANGER WAS IGNORED AND THEN DISMISSED. MISTER CHAIR THE REASON THAT I ASKED FOR IT TO BE PULLED OUT OF ON A OFF OF CONSENT IS THAT I WANTED ANNA. AS THAT IS BECAUSE MOTHER TO ITEM BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO YOU. AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE ANA WAS BECAUSE MONTH. THANK YOU. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY EXPRESSING HOW HONORED I AM TO BE SPEAKING HERE ON BEHALF OF MY SON. I SIT BEFORE YOU AS A MOTHER. AS A VETERAN OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY. AS A FORMER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. BUT ALSO AS AN ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN. AND ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN WHO SUFFER AT THE HANDS OF AN ABUSIVE PARENT. AND CHILDREN WHO FALL VICTIM TO OUR COURT SYSTEM. MY PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO SHARE MY PERSONAL TESTIMONY TO RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT US CALIFORNIA LEADERS PLAY IN THE LIVES OF OTHERS. AND TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO REFLECT ON HOW THE MURDER OF AN INNOCENT CHILD. CAN INFLUENCE THE WAY YOU CHOOSE TO SERVE YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE FUTURE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AT LEAST FIFTY THREE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MURDERED IN CALIFORNIA. SEVEN OF THOSE CHILDREN WERE RESIDENTS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE I RESIDE. THREE CHILDREN HAD THEIR THROATS SLIT BY THEIR MOTHER. THE FOURTH CHILD WAS TORTURED TO DEATH BY HIS MOTHER AND HER AND HER BOYFRIEND. IT WAS. EIGHT THE FIFTH CHILD WAS MURDERED BY VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER HE WAS TEN DAYS OLD WHEN HIS FATHER INTENTIONALLY RAN HIM OVER. CHILD NUMBER SIX WAS RECENTLY MURDERED BY HIS MOTHER AND STEPFATHER HE WAS TORTURED TO DEATH BY HIS PARENTS. AND THE LAST CHILD MY SON. I MUST ADDRESS THE ON THE SECOND. LOVINGLY KNOWN AS SPEAKING. WAS MURDERED BY HIS FATHER. MY EX HUSBAND. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AYE BUT I MET THE MAN OF MY DREAMS AND ONE YEAR LATER WE WERE MARRIED. MY WE MARRIAGE LASTED EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS AND MORE THAN HALF OF THAT TIME WAS SPENT ON ME TRYING TO HAVE A BABY. AND AFTER MANY YEARS OF PRAYERS. AND FIVE MISCARRIAGES. GOD FINALLY LISTENED. AND BLESSED ME WITH THE CHILD MY ONLY CHILD. WHEN MY SON WAS FOUR IN APRIL OF? TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I TOLD MY EX HAS BEEN THAT I WANTED A DIVORCE. AND ALTHOUGH HE PRETENDED TO BE DISTRAUGHT. HE ACTUALLY BEGAN PLOTTING HOW HE WAS GOING TO HURT ME AND MY SON. IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I FILED FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST MY EX HUSBAND. THE JUDGE WHO PRESIDED OVER MY DIVORCE CASE WAS GIVEN IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE. DOCUMENTING MY EX HUSBAND'S HORRIFIC BEHAVIOR. IN ADDITION TO THE EVIDENCE I SUBPOENAED THREE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO TESTIFY. ON THE DOCUMENTED LIES IN THE PHYSICAL ABUSE TOWARD MY SON. THE FAMILY COURT JUDGE DISREGARDED THE EVIDENCE AND RULED AGAINST ALLOWING TESTIMONY FROM THE THREE OFFICERS. STATING THEY WERE THERE FOR CUSTODY REASONS NOT ABUSE. THE RESTRAINING ORDER WAS DENIED AND SO WAS MY REQUEST FOR SOLE CUSTODY WITH SUPERVISED VISITS. DESPITE REPEATED WARNINGS IN WRITING TO THE COURT MULTIPLE REQUESTS FOR SOLE CUSTODY WITH SUPERVISED VISITS. I REQUEST FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER. AND MY EX HAS BEEN FILING FALSE ALLEGATIONS WITH CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES. MY PLEASE FOR MY SON SAFETY FELL ON DEAF EARS AND THE VOLUMES OF EVIDENCE THAT I PROVIDED TO THE COURT WERE IGNORED. ACCORDING TO THE HOMICIDE DETECTIVES EVIDENCE SEIZED DURING THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT MY EX HUSBAND BEGAN PLANNING MY SON'S MURDER. JUST WEEKS AFTER MY APPEARANCE IN COURT. FOR THE RESTRAINING ORDER. AS OF TODAY. I HAVE LIVED FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY DAYS. WITHOUT MY PT. ON APRIL TWENTY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MY EX HUSBAND SUFFOCATED MY SON. IN THE BACKSEAT OF HIS VEHICLE ON MY SON WAS ASLEEP. STRAPPED INTO HIS CAR SEAT. AFTER A DAY LONG TRIP TO DISNEYLAND. ACCORDING TO THE HOMICIDE DETECTIVES MY SON AWOKE DURING THIS VIOLENT ACT. AND HIS FIRST ATTEMPT AT SUFFOCATING MY SON FAILED. AND AS MY SON SAT HELPLESSLY IN HIS CAR SEAT. HIS BODY TWITCHING MY EX HUSBAND PRECEDED TO SUFFOCATE HIM A SECOND TIME. AND HERE'S MY SON SWEATER TO DO IT. MY SON WAS FIVE YEARS TWO MONTHS AND TWO DAYS OLD. MY EX HUSBAND COMMITTED THIS CRIME. BECAUSE OF ME WANTING A DIVORCE. AND TRYING TO PROTECT MY SON. DURING HIS CONFESSION HE STATED THAT HE HATED M AND WANTED TO HURT ME. AND HE DID. HE HURT ME IN THE DEEPEST AND MOST INHUMANE POSSIBLE WAY POSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH IT TOOK ME FORTY YEARS TO BRING MY BEAUTIFUL SON INTO THIS WORLD. IT TOOK HIS FATHER APPROXIMATELY FOUR MINUTES TO END HIS LIFE. MY NEW REALITY IS THAT I WILL NEVER SEE MY SON AGAIN. AT LEAST NOT IN THIS LIFETIME. AND BEING A SURVIVOR OF VIOLENT CRIME COMES WITH A LIFE SENTENCE. FOR ME THAT SENTENCE IS HAVING TO LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT MY SON. SO I AM HERE TODAY TESTIFYING ON Y. CHILD SAFETY IS OF SUCH IMPORTANCE. MY SON'S DEATH WAS PREVENTABLE. AND SO WHERE THE FIFTY TWO OTHER CHILDREN WHO WERE MURDERED IN CALIFORNIA BY A PARENT. TRAINING FOR COURT RELATED PROFESSIONALS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND SHOULD NOT BE AN OPTION. THE JUDGES AND CUSTODY EVALUATOR INVOLVED IN MY DIVORCE CLEARLY MADE UNEDUCATED DECISIONS. AND JUDGES AND EVALUATORS ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS WHOSE ROLE. ACCORDING TO THE LAW. IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF CHILDREN. IN MY CASE AS IN MANY OTHERS THEY FAIL TO UPHOLD FAMILY CODE THEY FAILED MY SON. AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY CONTINUE TO FAIL MANY OTHERS. IT IS MY HOPE THAT TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING CHILDREN. AND ESTABLISH A SENSE OF URGENCY WHEN IT COMES TO TRULY MAKING CHILD SAFETY A PRIORITY. NOTHING I DO WILL EVER BRING WAIKIKI BACK. AND I PERSONALLY HAVE NOTHING TO TO GAIN BY BEING HERE TODAY. AS I HAVE ALREADY LOST. WHAT WAS DEAR TO ME? BUT I DO THINK HERE BEFORE YOU. BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT ANOTHER PARENT. TO EXPERIENCE THE HORROR AND HEARTBREAK THAT I LIVE EACH AND EVERYDAY. SO WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO HERE TODAY COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THOUSANDS. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO SAVE INNOCENT LIVES AND PROTECT CHILDREN WHO SUFFER AT THE HANDS OF AN ABUSIVE PARENT AS MY SON DID. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BE THE LEADERS THAT OUR CHILDREN YOUR FUTURE CONSTITUENTS NEED YOU TO BE. I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOUR COMPASSION AND YOUR LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU WE HAVE A QUORUM SO HONEST HOURS KWAK'WALA REFLECTS STONE HERE [inaudible] CUNNINGHAM CHAU [inaudible] CHIU HOLDEN [inaudible] KALRA [inaudible] KILEY [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN REYES.

MANY OF THESE HOMICIDES INCLUDING P. KEYS WERE PREVENTABLE IF FAMILY COURTS IT PRIORITIZE CHILD SAFETY OVER OTHER BEST INTERESTS FACTORS. WHEN DETERMINING CUSTODY AND VISITATION? AND OF COURSE PROFESSIONALS WERE TRAUMA INFORMED. THE THREE SIMPLE CHANGES PROPOSED IN THIS RESOLUTION OF FOCUS ON CHILD SAFETY. ACCESS TO JUSTICE THROUGH COURT REPORTERS AND TRAUMA INFORMED PROFESSIONALS WITH EXPERTISE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE.

MAYBE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA I'M IN SUPPORT OF ACR. TO SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S GENERALLY PROGRESSIVE NONDISCRIMINATION LAWS LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS AND PARTICULARLY NON BINARY INDIVIDUALS CONTINUE TO BE MARGINALIZED AND IGNORED. IN ADDITION TO BEING SUBJECTED TO FREQUENT MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MICROGRAPHS SHINS. NON BINARY CALIFORNIANS OFTEN HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR VERY RIGHT TO EXIST. BY CONTINUING TO USE HE AND SHE PRONOUNS IN STATUTES AND LEGISLATION. CALIFORNIA IS TURNING ITS BACK ON ITS NON BINARY RESIDENTS WHICH FURTHER ISOLATES AND MARGINALIZES THEM. INSTEAD OF USING HE OR SHE BILL LANGUAGE CAN EASILY BE SHAPED TO APPLY TO ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF GENDER. SUCH AS USING THEY AS A SINGULAR PRONOUN. OR REPEATING A NOUN INSTEAD OF USING A GENDERED PRONOUN. THIS RESOLUTION IS ALSO IN LINE WITH RECENT CHANGES TO CALIFORNIA LAW. UNDER S. B. ONE SEVENTY NINE WHICH LEGALLY RECOGNIZES A NON BINARY GENDER IDENTITY. THIS RESOLUTION WILL SHOW CALIFORNIA'S NON BINARY RESIDENTS THAT THEIR DIGNITY RESPECT AND RECOGNITION IS A PRIORITY.

KILEY MAIENSCHEIN REYES REYES I NEEDS TO MORE SOARED WITH APPLE LA QUINTA VIGOROUSLY SHAHKOT THANK YOU [inaudible] MISTER GLAZIER. THIS TAKES US TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR SJR [inaudible] FOURTEEN GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND THAT THAT YOU'RE STONE IN MEMBERS SAID THIS RESOLUTION CALLS ON CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. TO RENAME ALL FEDERAL PUBLIC PLACES INCLUDING PARKS BUILDINGS AND ROADWAYS. THERE ARE THE NAMES OF ELECTED MILITARY LEADERS OF THE CONFEDERACY. AT THIS RESOLUTION ALSO URGES CONGRESS TO REMOVE STATUES. OF ELECTED OUR MILITARY LEADERS. OF THE CONFEDERACY AND PLACE THEM IN MUSEUMS WHERE THEY CAN BE VIEWED IN PROPER HISTORICAL CONTEXT. THIS RESOLUTION IS IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE I INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IT CALLED FOR CONGRESS TO TAKE OUT MONUMENTS TO CONFEDERATE LEADERS I YOUR STAFF ANALYSIS WITH THAT WHICH IS WHAT. WONDERFULLY DOT DOES POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THE CHANGE THEIR IN THE RESOLUTION THAT RECOGNIZES THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY -- OF THE CHARLOTTESVILLE BRYANT'S. AND IT'S AN APPROPRIATE AMENDMENTS ACT. TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT ANNIVERSARY ALSO. HA HONORS THE THAT THE PERSON WHO PASSED AWAY DURING THAT -- THAT RALLY AND IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA. THAT RECENTLY RESPONDED BY RENAMING JEFFERSON DAVIS HIGHWAY TO TO TO RICH THE HIGHWAY SO THERE'S SOME CHANGES FROM. CLOSE BUT FORWARD AT A YEAR AGO. UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY PUBLIC PLACES IN OUR NATION'S TO HONOR CONFEDERATE LEADERS WHO SPLIT OUR COUNTRY INTO IS THE FIGHT TO PRESERVE THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY. IT'S BEEN HEARTENING TO SEE THAT A NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. HAS LED TO SOME INSTITUTIONS TAKING DOWN SOME CONFEDERATE NAMES HOW ONE OF THOSE THAT I JUST MENTIONED. A BY THE WAY WE HAD TO SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WERE NAMED AFTER ROBERT E. LEE -- AND WITHIN THE LAST YEAR HAVE CHANGED THEIR NAMES THROUGH A COMMUNITY PROCESS ITSELF -- WE ALSO SEEN SOME PROGRESS HERE IN OUR STATE -- ANNA AND I AS I MENTIONED WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK TOO FAR TO UNDERSTAND HOW URGENT THE SITUATION IS WITH THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SHOOTING DEATH. UP NINE BLACK PARISHIONERS AT A SOUTH CAROLINA CHURCH THE HANDS OF A WHITE NATIONALISTS. SO I. I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE OUR SEARCH FOR RACIAL HARMONY -- AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD TAKE A BIG STEP FORWARD IF CONGRESS WERE TO ACT. TO REMOVE THESE RACIALLY DIVISIVE SYMBOLS FROM ALL FEDERAL PROPERTIES. MY HOPE THIS RESOLUTION INSPIRES PEOPLE TO RE EXAMINE. ANY AND ALL TIES AMERICA MAY HAVE WITH THE CONFEDERACY AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU AND SENATE YOU MENTIONED THE AMENDMENTS BUT YOU'RE TAKING THOSE ABOUT A CERTAIN PARTS IT TAKES US IN THAT YES SIR THANK YOU AND THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU.

YOUR ONE TED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ARE YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR OUT WORKING WITH US ON THIS RESOLUTION -- AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES OPCODES AMENDMENT SECURE -- WHICH WE BELIEVE RESULT IN NUMBER THE ISSUES RAISED IN OPPOSITION LETTER TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US. BUT I'M HONORED TO PRESENT SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE TEN OF WHICH RECOGNIZES INTERSECTS CALIFORNIANS -- AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STATES DIVERSITY. CELEBRATED OUR WEB RATHER THAN A CONSIDERED SOME SORT OF ABERRATION IN NEED OF CORRECTION. APPROXIMATELY ONE IN EVERY TWO THOUSAND BABIES -- IS BORN WITH EXTERNAL SEX CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE NOT PERCEIVED AS WHAT WE TYPICALLY DO IS MALE OR FEMALE -- SUCH A BABY WOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTER SOCKS AND STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICE FOR MANY YEARS. OF ALL THE MEDICAL PRACTICES SHIFTED SOMEWHAT BUT STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICE HAS OFTEN BEEN. UP TO ALMOST IMMEDIATELY PERFORM INFANT SEX ASSIGNMENT SURGERY GENITAL SURGERY UP TO CONFORM THAT INFANT'S BODY TO STANDARD NOTIONS OF MASCULINITY AND FEMININITY. WHETHER OR NOT THAT SURGERY IS MEDICALLY NO. MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR EXAMPLE THE BABY CANNOT URINATE OR SOME ADRENALYN BALANCE -- VERSES ARE NON MEDICALLY NECESSARY ESSENTIALLY COSMETIC SURGERY -- TO SAY WE'RE GOING. TO MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE WHAT WE PERCEIVE TO BE MALE OR A FEMALE ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS RISK OF GETTING ASSIGNED TO THE WRONG GENDER -- BECAUSE OUR ALTHOUGH THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THEN GROW UP AND DIE GENDER ASSIGNMENT WAS TO BE A GENDER WITH WHICH IDENTIFY. THEIR PEOPLE WHO GROW UP AYE AND IDENTIFY WITH A DIFFERENT UNDER. ANOTHER BECOMES AN IRREVERSIBLE I CHANGE THAT PERSON'S BODY THAT THAT'S NOT. INFORMED WITH THEIR OWN GENDER IDENTITY. ASIDE FROM THAT OBVIOUS RISK. A THESE THE REVERSAL SURGERIES CAN LEAD TO PERMANENT LOSS OF SEXUAL SENSATIONS STERILIZATION INCONTINENCE AND A VARIETY OF SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS -- AT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR WHAT THIS RESOLUTION STATES IS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER TO HAVE THAT SURGERY. SET UP FOR ME AT WHEN THEIR BABY. BUT IT'S NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY. LET'S LET THESE. KIDS DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES EXPRESS THEIR VENDOR. DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO HAVE THE SURGERY IF THEY WANT TO TAKE -- THOSE RISKS -- THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT A CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA OR CA H. -- WHICH CAN CAUSE INTERSECTS TRAITS -- INFANTS BORN WITH CA H. GENERALLY REQUIRE A VARIETY OF MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS. TO PREVENT SEVERE HARM OR EVEN DEATH FROM DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS. T. ADRENAL HORMONES -- AGAIN WE DON'T OPPOSE IN ANYWAY TREATMENT FOR THAT MEDICAL CONDITION. INVASIVE GENITAL SURGERIES HOWEVER IN NO WAY TREAT THAT UNDERLYING CONDITION -- SO -- THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES -- AND ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR GENDER RATHER THAN HAVING PHYSICIANS. I AM PARENTS -- WHEN THE CHILD AS A BABY -- MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEM THAT IRREVERSIBLE [inaudible] I DECISION. NOT SO WITH ME HERE TODAY. ARE ELOQUENT -- AND INTERACT YOUTH MEMBER INSECTS PERSON -- IRK LOWMAN AUTHOR OF THE BOOK RAISING ROSY OUR STORY OF PARENTING AND INTERCEPTS CHILD AND A NOTE TO SOMEONE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS DOCTOR ARE LIAM AYE PARROTS WHO SERVES ON THE BOARD OF INTERACT -- AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. MY NAME IS ALIQUIPPA I AM TWENTY SIX AND I AM NON BINARY WHICH MEANS THAT I DON'T IDENTIFY AS MALE OR FEMALE I AM INTERSEX PERSON WITH CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA. I GREW UP HAPPILY WITHOUT COSMETIC CLITORAL REDUCTION SURGERY I HAVE A FORM OF CH CALLED THREE BETA HST I HAD NO PHYSICAL DIFFERENCE AT BIRTH SO WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL I WAS SIX AT THAT AGE MY BODY BEGIN DEVELOP MORE TYPICALLY MASCULINE TRAITS. BECAUSE OF THE GENITAL DIFFERENCES I DEVELOPED MY DOCTORS WANTED TO SURGICALLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF MY* BY THE WAY 39% OF PATIENTS IN ONE STUDY WHO HAD THE SURGERY COULD NOT ORGASM AS ADULTS. THE DOCTORS WANTED TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR ME AS A SIX YEAR OLD. I GOT LUCKY MY MOM KNEW A COSMETIC CLITORAL REDUCTION WASN'T SOMETHING HER SIX YEAR OLD NEEDED. SHE TOLD THE DOCTORS NOW AND I AM SO GRATEFUL. BECAUSE MY MOM KNEW WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK IN BECAUSE SHE WASN'T AFRAID OF RAISING A CHILD WHOSE BODY WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. I WAS SAVED FROM AN INVASIVE NON CONSENSUAL GENITAL SURGERY. LOTS OF LOVING PARENTS MIGHT NOT KNOW TO SPEAK UP BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THE DOCTORS WOULD ONLY ADVOCATE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN. MANY DOCTORS TELL PARENTS THAT KIDS LIKE ME WILL BE BULLIED VIRGIN LITTLE DIFFERENCES BUT THEY HAVE NO DATA ON THIS HYPOTHETICAL HARM. AS A CA AGE TEAM LOCKER ROOM CYMBELINE WITH THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES COMPARED TO FUTURE SEXUAL FUNCTION DOCTORS ARE STILL OPERATING ON THEIR ASSUMPTIONS INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO INTERSEX PATIENTS LIKE ME. THOSE OPPOSING AT SEA ARE ONE TEN BROUGHT SOMEONE WHO WAS HAPPY THAT SHE HAD A SURGERY AS A YOUNG CHILD I'M GLAD THAT WORKED OUT. FOR IT DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR MY FRIEND JOHNNY OR MY FRIEND AXLE OR BRIAN A MAN WOULD SEE AGE WAS WRONGLY ASSIGNED FEMALE AND HAD GENITAL SURGERY REMOVING TISSUE HOME NEVER GET BACK. I'M HERE TODAY FOR THEM. I COULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER INTERSEX PERSON SO YOU WOULD SEE A AGE FORCED TO FIT INTO A GENDER I'M NOT. STUDIES SHOW ONE IN EIGHT OF US WITH SEEDS DON'T IDENTIFY AS GIRLS BUT THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO PRETEND THAT WE DON'T EXIST AND WHATEVER OUR GENDERS WE ALL DESERVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE OUR OWN CHOICES. ABOUT COSMETIC GENITAL SURGERY. I AM GRATEFUL FOR MY NATURAL AND ALTERED INTERSEX BODY AND FOR THIS RESOLUTION THAT SUPPORTS OTHERS LIKE ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITNESS BUT MY NAME IS ERIC WOMAN I MA INTRACTABLE AND MEMBER. A COLLEGE PROFESSOR AND I'M THE PROUD FATHER OF INTERSEX DAUGHTER WITH CONGENITAL GREETED DRILL HYPERPLASIA. EFFECT TODAY IS HER BIRTHDAY OUR SIXTH BIRTHDAY I LEFT OUR FAMILY VACATION HOW IN OHIO SO THAT I COULD BE HERE BECAUSE I SO STRONGLY BELIEVE. ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS RESOLUTION. AND I WOULD SECOND GIVE BIRTH TO ROSY SIX YEARS AGO TODAY AND THAT'S WHEN OUR EXPERIENCE -- PRESSURE PATHOLOGY ISING OUTRIGHT LIES FROM THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY BEGAN. YOU'RE ALL JUST TOLD US THAT ROSY WOULD NEED SURGERY TO CREATE A VAGINAL OPENING AND SEPARATE THE URETHRA FROM THE VAGINAL CANAL. EVEN THOUGH ITTESTS THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED THE DAY BEFORE SHOW THAT THERE WAS NORMAL URINARY FUNCTION. EVEN OFFERED TO COMBINE THE SURGERY WITH THE COSMETIC LITERAL REDUCTION SURGERY JUST A WHILE SHE WAS UNDER THE ANESTHETIC. NOW THEY ONE DISORDER KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE THEY NEVER PRESENTED NO SURGERY AS AN OPTION TO US. SEVEN I HAD TO ASK FORCEFULLY NEUROLOGISTS ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY. AND HE SAID HE PURPOSELY DIDN'T MENTION ARE DELAYING SURGERY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A WORTHWHILE AVENUE. EVEN THOUGH HER URINARY FUNCTION WAS FIND EVEN ORTEZ APPROVING IT THE DAY BEFORE. HOT HE STILL INSISTED THAT SURGERY WAS THE BEST OPTION. EVEN A FEW MIGHT NEVER WANT TO VAGINAL OPENING. UP AND AT LEAST PROBABLY UNTIL PUBERTY WOULD ONE BECOME NECESSARY. ANOTHER FAMILY LIKE OURS WITH -- DOT WITH THE AGE OF THE SIMILAR STORY BOTH THE UROLOGIST AND ROSIE'S UROLOGIST TRY TO PRESSURE US INTO SURGERY. USING CLAIMS THAT ARE SIMPLY UNTRUE. SUCH AS YOUR CHILD WILL HAVE FREQUENT URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS. IT'S A VERY VERY COMMON IN FACT UP FOR PARENTS OF C. H. GIRLS A TO HEAR THIS CLAIM. ROSIEIS SIX YEARS OLD HAS NEVER HAD A URINARY TRACT INFECTION IS ADONAL SURGERY. ARE THE OTHER PARENTS WHO WERE CLOSE WITH A ALSO HAS A FIVE FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO'S NEVER HAVE URINARY TRACT INFECTION IN SPITE OF BEING TOLD THIS WAS AN INEVITABILITY MULTIPLE FUTURE HAS IN FACT BECOME AND NOT ONLY HAVE. NEITHER OF OUR GIRLS NEVER HAD THE U. TI BUT THE RESEARCH OF NEUROLOGISTS HAS PROVEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT. LEFT UNTREATED. THESE GIRLS ARE NOT PRONE TO YOU TWO GUYS AND YET LOTS OF PARENTS ARE STONE OF IMPRESSION THAT THESE ARE COMMON [inaudible] A IN FACT A UT I RISKY SHOWN ONLY TO THESE GENTLE SURGERIES SELF. ARE ONLY AFTER THESE SURGERIES TO GROWTH TYPICALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE I. URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS. THE OPPOSITION WILL TRY TO CONFUSE THE ISSUE BY POINTING OUT THE VERY REAL MEDICAL CONCERNS FOR MANY FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. WITH C. H. AS THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A REASON TO REJECT THE RESOLUTION AND AS A PARENT OF A US MULTI WITH CH I APPRECIATE. THE DISTINCTION IN THE MEANT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY. WELL YES I TAKE MEDICATION THREE TIMES A DAY SHE WAS A MEDICAL ALERT BRACELET EVERYWHERE THAT SHE GOES WE HAVE TO CARRY AND MURDER YOU SEE BAG OF INJECTIONS AROUND. EVERYWHERE THAT SHE GOES. I IN FACT JUST WE'RE IN OHIO SHE GOT SICK AND VOMITED AND WE'RE AT A COTTAGE. AND SO WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GIVE THIS MEDICATION WHERE THE CLOSEST HOSPITAL WAS SENT US INTO A FRENZY. TURNS OUT SHE JUST IT TOO MANY HOT DOGS BUT IT WAS STILL. A VERY VERY. CONCERNING EPISODES HAPPENS A LOT WITH KIDS WITH CA AGE TO BE VERY STRATEGIC WRAP UP. THE FROTHY ONLY ETHICAL CHOICE WE'RE PRESENTED WITH. THIS OPTION WAS TO LET ROSY DECIDE FOR HERSELF AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE ARE ONLY REASONABLE OPTION THAT WE COULD CONSIDER IF THERE IS NO MEDICALLY NECESSARY REASON FOR HER TO HAVE ANY. SURGERY AND BY DEFINITION THIS IS A COSMETIC PROCEDURE. SO I CAME HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AND I HOPE. THEY WILL PASS IT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] X. WITNESS. ALRIGHT ONLY. TO ANYONE UP LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS [inaudible] RESOLUTION. YOU JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION AND MY CHILD ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. JOHN MICHAEL FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR IN SUPPORT AND ALSO LIKE TO STATE THE SUPPORT OF CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY NETWORK WHO COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. HINES LINDAHL FOR INTERACT ADVOCATES FOR INFORMED CHOICE -- STRONGLY SUPPORT. THANK YOU IN ON US IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SAY NONE OPPOSITION MORNING FANATIC. SHARON STONE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY REGARDING. SCR. ONE TEN MY NAME IS WAYNE PALMER I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED PEDIATRIC UROLOGISTS PRACTICING IN NEW YORK IN CASE THAT HASN'T COME THROUGH YET. I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY FOR PEDIATRIC UROLOGY WHICH IS THE PRIMARY ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING AMERICAN PEDIATRIC UROLOGISTS WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEMBERS. FIFTY OF COME FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS FEW GREATLY APPRECIATES THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON BEHALF OF SCR OF ONE TEN TO HELP CORRECT SOME OF THE INACCURACIES THAT. WERE PRESENTED INITIALLY BUT WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE RESOLUTION TO ADDRESS TWO PRIMARY CONCERNS. THE FIRST IS THAT TERMS LIKE INTERSECTS WITH HERE'S THE ARE INTENTIONALLY MEANT TO BE BROUGHT. BUT AS MORE INFORMATION COMES LITERATURE AND OTHER -- LITERATURE IS A BECOMES CLEAR THAT SOME DIAGNOSES JUST ARE. MISS -- REPRESENTED INTO THE GORY OR IN FACT STAND ON ITS OWN -- SHE EIGHT REPRESENTS 90% OF THE CASES THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED BY SIAKA SERE ONE TEN YET THE VAST MAJORITY OF C. H. PATIENTS. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF MEDICAL SPECIALISTS TO MANAGE PATIENTS WITH C. H. DON'T CONSIDER IT INTERSECTS. BUT RATHER A METABOLIC DISORDER OF THE OF THE ADRENAL GLAND WHICH APARTMENT NATURE AND EARLIER -- THE HIGH TESTOSTERONE LEVELS WHICH MAY ALTER THE APPEARANCE OF THE GONADS IS A RISK FOR SOME OF THE PATIENTS HAVE C. H. BUT NOT CLEARLY ALL OF THEM. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF THE EXTERNAL GENITALIA IT THAT'S NOT IMPACT THE THE INTERNAL GENITALIA SO IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S NO ISSUE WITH THE OVARIES HAVE NO ISSUE WITH UTERUS IF LOOKING IN TOMBS TUBES THIS IS PRIMARILY AN EXTERNAL GENITALIA ISSUE. AND IN FACT IF DIAGNOSED EARLY ENOUGH IN SELECT CASES IT CAN BE MANAGED AND THE EFFECTS OF THE TESTOSTERONE ARE NOT PRESENT AT BIRTH. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT MANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS OR POP OR ROCK COMMENTS STATED IN THE WHEREAS SECTIONS OF THE RESOLUTION REALLY REFLECT THAT AN ESTIMATE AND ANACHRONISTIC VIEW OF THE CURRENT STATE OF MEDICAL AFFAIRS WHAT WE DO WHEN WE ENCOUNTER PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH WITH THE STD OR CA H.? IS VERY DIFFERENT TODAY THAN IT WAS BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN I STARTED MY PRACTICE OR STARTED TRAINING. TODAY WE HAVE A MULTI SPECIALTY TEAM. THE TEEMING CORPORATES ADOLESCENT GYNECOLOGIST SOCIAL WORKERS -- GENETICIST DEVELOPMENTAL FAR BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICIANS AS WELL AS ENDOCRINOLOGIST IN PEDIATRIC UROLOGIST BECAUSE THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF ISSUES THAT EACH SPECIFIC TRIAL HAS AND THEY SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. IN TURN BY THOSE WHO KNOW FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT -- THE MOST ABOUT THE SPECIFIC ISSUES SO THAT FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS -- TO EVIDENCE BASED INFORMATION NOT ANECDOTAL INFORMATION REGARDING WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE OPTIONS FOR THEIR CHILD. AND SURGERY REMAINS AN OPTION IT'S NOT APPLY TO EVERYBODY ITS SUPPLY JUDICIOUSLY AND FAMILIES ARE SHOULD BE GIVEN ALL THE INFORMATION SO THAT THEY IN THE MEANTIME STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THE ABILITY TO HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM -- WE APPRECIATE THE THE EFFORTS ON BEHALF INCLUDING THE AUTHOR OF WORKING WITH US IN TRYING. TO MAKE THIS RESOLUTION MORE ACCURATE BUT AS A CURRENTLY STATES -- WE ARE OF HIS REMAIN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE RESOLUTION UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT A SWISS -- FOR FIRST ABOVE THANK YOU ALLEY FOR SHARING YOUR STORY AND HAPPY pA AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN STONE AND FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS ADRIAN MARKS AND I AM A TWENTY SIX YEAR OWNERS FROM NAPA CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS MY STORY OF CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA OR CA EACH. WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A MY BIRTH MY FAMILY'S JOY WAS QUICKLY REPLACED WITH TRIPS TO THE ICU AND FEAR. FOUR DAYS LATER STANFORD DOCTORS TOLD MY PARENTS WHAT. I HAD CA H. A LIFE THREATENING ADRENAL DISORDER REQUIRING DAILY MEDICATION TO SURVIVE. BECAUSE OF CA H. I WAS ALSO BORN WITH MALFORMED EXTERNAL GENITALIA BUT I WAS A GIRL. IF NOT FOR THREE SUCCESSFUL SURGERIES AT THE AGES OF ONE FOUR AND SIXTEEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALLY TRAUMATIZED. BE SURGERIES ALLOWED ME TO LIVE AS A HEALTHY CHILD PREVENTED CHRONIC URINARY INFECTIONS AND TODAY I AM IN A LOVING LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP. AS A BISEXUAL FEMALE AND A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE LGBT PLUS COMMUNITY I DO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE FOR SCR. ONE TEN HOWEVER SEE AGE IS NOT SIMPLY AN LGBT MATTER BUT A LIFE THREATENING MEDICAL CONDITION. I A 100% SUPPORT GENDER DIVERSITY BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT A POLICY THAT WAS WRITTEN WITHOUT CONSULTING THE LEADING EXPERTS IN CA H. OR EVEN THE C. H. COMMUNITY ITSELF. BECAUSE OF THIS I WORRY FOR THE FUTURE C. H. KIDS WHO MIGHT DIE OF A SIMPLE URINARY INFECTION. OR THE GIRL WHO WROTE THIS LETTER A NINETEEN YEAR OLD COLLEGE SOPHOMORE WHO STATED NOT EVEN HER WORST ENEMY YOU SHOULD SUFFER THE EMOTIONAL PAIN SHE HASN'T HEARD TO NOT HAVING SIR SURGERY EARLY ENOUGH -- I DO THINK CHAIRMAN STONE FOR RECOGNIZING IN THE ANALYSIS HOUSE CA H. IS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER CONDITIONS ADDRESSED IN SCR. ONE TEN AS I'VE SHARED TODAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF CA H. PATIENTS DO HAVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES A GENITAL SURGERY. WE SEE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AS LIFESAVERS AND NOT MONSTERS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE ARE HAPPY. FINALLY IF S. C. ARE ONE TEN IS ABOUT PATIENTS USING THEIR VOICE AND PLEASE LISTEN TO US. ASKING TO HAVE A CHOICE IN THIS VERY PERSONAL DECISION. I URGE YOU ALL TO AMEND S. C. R. ONE TEND TO CLEARLY EXCLUDE CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA THINKING [inaudible] THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. YOU COME FORWARD AND STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. THE NAME'S NICOLE GREENBERG AND I'M THE GIRLFRIEND OF A DREAM I'M FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND I IDENTIFIES LGBTQ AND I OPPOSE. DOCTOR ROGER DE FILIPPO PEDIATRIC ARE ALL JUST HOLDS HOSPITAL SAN JOS ALSO REPRESENT CARES FOUNDATION I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS YEAR ONE TENTH. I STRONGLY OPPOSE. SEE ARE ONE TEN AND LINDA SHORT LIFE PREVIOUS CHAIR AT TYPES OF UROLOGY AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY PEDIATRIC UROLOGIST. I'M GENERALLY KORA PARENT OF A CHILD WITH SO WASTING CONGENITAL HYPERPLASIA AND I OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION. SENATE AND MEL NAPA VALLEY NEIGHBOR OF ADRIAN AND I POSTS ARE RESOLUTION. I'M ELIZABETH MARKS ADRIAN'S MOTHER. AND I I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS ESSAY ARE ONE TEN UNLESS AMENDED TO EXCLUDE CA H.. I'M PETER MARKS FROM NAPA CALIFORNIA ALSO THE FATHER OF ADRIN MARKS AND I STRONGLY PROSE AS SEE ARE ONE TEN AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK. TO THE COMMITTEE CENTER THANK YOU. FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THEIR PROPONENTS OF THE OPPONENTS AND IN FACT WHEN TALK TO QUITE A SEVERAL. UROLOGISTS AND SURGEONS NONE OF WHOM KNEW THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE I WANTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CA H. THE IMPACT AND AND AND THE SPECTRUM THAT IT REPRESENTS AND FROM MY STANDPOINT. I DO UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BUT I THINK THIS RESOLUTION AT THIS POINT IS. IS A REASONABLY FAIR STATEMENTS ALTHOUGH I THINK THE AT THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IF IF THIS STATEMENT IS GOING TO TURN INTO POLICY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SOME DEFINITIONS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED LIKE. THE AGE OF CONSENT WOULD NEED TO BE TALKED ABOUT THE MEDICAL NECESSITY AND AND SOME OF THE REAL DIFFERENCES. WITHIN THIS SPECTRUM OF OF CA H. I SORT OF FIND WITHOUT BEING A MEDICAL EXPERT AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT. ALL OF THE PHYSICIANS HAD SPENT WITH ME TO TRY AND BRING ME UP TO SPEED ON ON SOME OF THIS IT'S CH IS IS REALLY A SPECTRUM THAT PRESENTS. DIFFERENT PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES. FOR EACH OF THE PATIENTS AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT ADRENAL COMPLICATIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE THERE THAT THAT DO REQUIRE SOME MEDICAL ASSISTANCE I THINK CERTAINLY HAS THAT AS A SENATOR POINTED OUT. SO IT IT DEFTLY RAISES SOME QUESTIONS BUT THAT THE THE INTENTION OF ENSURING. THAT CHILDREN HAVE THE BEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE THAT THEY'RE ENGAGED IN THOSE DECISIONS THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP THEIR IDENTITY. AS THEY ARE BORN AND AS THEY FEEL IS REALLY WHAT I SEE ARE ONE TEN IS IS ABOUT. AND AS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE OPPONENTS AND THE PROPONENTS. EVERYBODY ENDS UP SAYING PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THAT. THE QUESTION REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE SPECIFICS OF CA H. THE SPECTRUM THAT IT PRESENTS AND THE DECISIONS THAT PARENTS AND PHYSICIANS FACE. IN EFFECT NONE OF THE PHYSICIANS THAT I TALK. TO WERE INCLINED IN THIS IS A CASE A SUBSET I WILL ADMIT AND A SUBSET IN SORT OF MY AREA. NONE OF THEM WOULD BE INCLINED TO RECOMMEND SURGERY BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT STEP NOW THAT MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER. ACROSSCALIFORNIA ARE CERTAINLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT SOMETHING AGAIN WORTHY OF DISCUSSION HERE. BUT IT SEEMS THAT [inaudible] PHYSICIANS ARE MORE INCLINED TO WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AND IN TEAMS WON A CASE PRESENTS ITSELF PROVIDE THE BEST INFORMATION POSSIBLE TO THE PARENT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS. AND THEN HOPEFULLY GIVE THAT CHILD THE CHANCE TO DEVELOP. FOR HIS OR HERSELF AND IN THEIR OWN IDENTITY AND AND THEIR OWN PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES BEFORE IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES ARE MADE AND TO ME THAT'S REALLY WHAT S. YOUR ONE TEN STANDS. FOR THIS WHY I'M SUPPORTING ITS ASK EVERYONE HERE TO SUPPORT IT BUT WITH THE CAUTION AND AGAIN THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT IF THIS IS GOING TO MOVE TO POLICY. THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS THAT THAT WILL NEED TO BE ANSWERED THIS IS A STATE WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IT IS NOT A STATEMENT OF POLICY BUT IS TAYLOR PLEDGES OF THE LEGISLATURE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO GET IT AS RIGHT AS WE CAN. AND WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS THROUGH. SO OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] ISRAEL. MISTER CHAIR I DO APPRECIATE ALL THAT NOT THAT YOU DID IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL -- THAT IS THE RESOLUTION IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A RESOLUTION AS OPPOSED TO POLICY. AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT SHOULD THIS MOVE FORWARD TO POLICY THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I I I I TAKE THE THAT YOUR COMMENTS VERY SERIOUSLY. AND WOULD WANT THAT TO BE INCLUDED BUT FOR TODAY I WOULD MOVE THE RESOLUTION. THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION. AND THE SECOND CHIU. OTHERS HAD IN ADDITION TO A SECOND IN THE MOTION THAT I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR. I HAS ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE RESOLUTION THAT THIS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES I THINK BOUT HAS BEEN A BIT OF A COMMON -- MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT A AND A VERY MUCH RESPECT THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OPPOSITION PARTICULARLY FROM. THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY BUT I THINK -- FOR ALL OF US FOR TALKING ABOUT A MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY PROCEDURE I KNOW THERE'S MIGHT BE SOME. DIFFERENCES ON WHAT THAT ENTAILS BUT IF THAT'S WERE TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF NOT ALLOWING -- STRIKES ME AS ONE THAT WE SHOULDN'T SUPPORT SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE REST OF THANK YOU ANYONE UP. RIGHT SIGNIN SENATOR YOU MAY QUOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AS I'M NOT GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO COME IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE HAVING PER THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION SEVERANCE APPRECIATE THAT -- COLLEAGUES AND WE ARE -- I DO KNOW THAT AT THIS ULTIMATELY MOVES OUT TO BILL OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE IN A LOT OF WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE WE KNOWLEDGE OUT BUT I THINK IT IS. IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT FOR US TO TAKE THIS STEP LOTS OF IT THIS IS A REAL ISSUE -- THERE MAY BE DISAGREEMENTS WITHIN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY -- WITH AND THE INTERSEX. POINTS OF VIEW I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WILL MAKE CLEAR THIS ISN'T ABOUT ANYWAY DEMONIZING THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT SAYING DOCTORS -- YOU KNOW MONSTERS ARE THERE ANYTHING ELSE I THINK IN A WAY EVEN THOUGH THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OBVIOUSLY IS FOCUSED ON MEDICINE. MEDICAL PROFESSION LIKE EVERY OTHER PROFESSION ON EARTH REFLECTS SOCIETY. OJ AT SOCIETY CHANGES AND EVOLVES NOTES IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OF BALD TREMENDOUSLY AROUND. LGBT ISSUES WHERE IT USED TO BE A WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS OUGHT TO BE LGBT AND OUT SOCIETY ABOUT. THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OF ALL AND IT'S OF A PUSH AND PULL AND SOMETIMES WE AS POLICY MAKERS. NEED TO PUSH THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WE DID AROUND CONVERSION THERAPY WITHOUT IT ON OTHER ISSUES -- AS WELL. AYE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE WE HAVE WORKED YOU KNOW. WITH THE MEDICAL PROFESSION THOUGHTS DOT CMA HAS REMOVED THE TOP POSITION BASED ON AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO DIALOGUE WITH THE PROFESSION. AND WITH THE COMMUNITY SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS THAT THE RESOLUTION BE ADOPTED AS AMENDED.
