incredible work that's

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:39.586
happening around the census-

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.421
we've been telling our senses

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.323
team here at the city that

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.427
there is no bigger issue. And

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:47.994
twenty twenty then for us to

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.395
ensure that everyone is

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.331
counted. And the ramifications

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.499
as we all know- that will

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.535
affect everything that we do.

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:59.339
All of the funding mechanisms

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.574
and programs are critical for

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:02.175
us to get the services that we

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:05.478
need I'm in a good count I'm is

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:07.780
not just about representation-

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:09.782
it's about finding it's about

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.951
equity it's about ensuring that

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:13.453
people get the social services

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.722
that they need- and it's making

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:16.189
sure that we know who

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:17.790
completely is a part of our

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:19.892
community. I will share is you

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.461
will know that we are

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:23.763
incredibly- concerned about are

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.498
harder to count communities. We

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.700
are incredibly concerned about

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.569
ensuring that all people-

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.704
including those are documented

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.673
in our community or a part of

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.775
our our census count. I mean

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:37.577
we're very grateful to the

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:41.481
state for the significant I

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.081
really think it's significant

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:43.616
funding and support. Has come

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:45.818
down from the governor and the

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:46.452
legislature. We want to be. Our

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:47.820
partners are I am very proud

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.789
there's a lot of folks that are

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:51.858
here. I'm in in the audience

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.626
and I recognize that are part

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:55.595
of our- complete count team. I

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.764
think Long Beach is a great

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.532
model we have a complete team

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.503
we have a broad. A coalition of

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.438
community organizations and

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.507
labor and business and

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:09.442
nonprofits and government.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:10.009
Other working together to

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.511
insure that everyone is

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:12.145
counted. I'm and the last thing

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:15.748
I'll say is. I was reading an

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:16.349
article this morning in the

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.817
paper and I'm I do know that

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.819
while lot of our a larger

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.754
cities seem to be well

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.690
organized- still need I think

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.625
up and down the state. Are from

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.460
four from some smaller

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.662
communities some communities

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.597
with large hard account

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:32.265
populations that don't seem to

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.468
have yet- even a coordinated

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:37.704
within their city- to help with

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.304
the census and so I'm really

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.806
hoping that. We're not just

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.641

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:42.208

California complete counts

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.810
program operations strategy in

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:59.879
funding and fact most recent-

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:00.446
hearing focused on language

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:03.850
access. This hearing we're

outreach strategy in this

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.689
particular region I think more

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.891
specifically. Also interested

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.826
as we are approaching really

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:15.728
the US census when- happened I

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:17.964
mean we're just months away.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:18.564
Think about it's not that far

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:21.667
away. To be sure that we have

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:22.201
this is the appropriate-

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:25.738
interface- between our- the

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:26.339
people on the ground in the

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.675
community the- local entities

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:31.978
like is the- the counties and

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:33.946
other partners in the C. vios

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.948
and the state. And to be sure

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.017
that- we have- clearer lines

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:40.086
of- expectations and lines

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:43.789
responsibility- between- each

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:44.357
of the different entities I

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.992
realize that may be different

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:47.860
in different areas- I think I

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:48.461
appreciate that the mayor of

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:51.697
Long Beach brought up that. No

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:52.265
one perhaps in some cities

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:53.799
where there are you know more

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.768
organizations and people to

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.670
working a longer. May need-

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.839
less help from it's a state or

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:01.774
regional entities whereas other

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:02.341
communities may need more

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:04.043
assistance. But we what we want

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.279
to be sure those especially we

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.680
talk about the hard to count-

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.916
we can't let people fall in the

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:11.684
gaps because of organizational

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.753
problems that we have so- I.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.088
John eager to hear how both-

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:18.090
what's happening here I won't

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:20.126
call a microcosm given how big

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:22.094
LA in Orange County are it's

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:23.829
America because of the state-

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.932
but I think you- this hearing

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:27.767
will hopefully set the two

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.969
counties as examples of. How

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.871
we're all this is all starting

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.706
to come together in preparation

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:35.942
for the count in April it's

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:36.542
again not that far away so

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:38.144
again I really appreciate this

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.879
opportunity to hear about. How

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:42.048
this is going how we're gonna

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:42.648
reach the hard count have a

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.050
going to. Reach the variety of

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:45.818
different communities we need

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.853
to count in order to be sure we

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.689
have a complete census. Data

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:51.857
like to- turn it over to- and

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.859
the chair of the assembly-

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:54.460
committee- and my good friend

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:56.062
so member Berman thank you so

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:58.197
much. Thank you so much larger

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.865
pan and center amber again and

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:00.499
the mayor Garcia and the city

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:03.803
of Long Beach. For hosting us-

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:05.871
as we all know the status can-

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:06.372
committed considerable

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.940
statewide planning and

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:09.909
resources. Towards the

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:10.509
achievement of a complete and

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:12.011
accurate census count in

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:14.046
California. However while

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:15.881
planning and resources are

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:19.785
important. They aren't enough.

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:22.288
We know that success will be

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:22.855
decided by what is actually

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:23.956
achieved at the grass its roots

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:25.891
level. How well we do in

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:26.492
reaching a complete count will

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.126
be determined neighborhood my

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:27.727
neighbor. Street by street in

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:28.294
door by door. If the census

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:29.996
ever were a basketball game. I

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:32.064
know basketball's cool again in

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:35.801
the LA Long Beach broader area-

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:36.469
then we de and during the third

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:39.805
quarter right now. The freight

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:40.339
Beth was rough in northern

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:40.873
California right now I'm a

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.208
little. It's nice to be down

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:45.811
here- this it will be entering

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:46.412
the third quarter right now-

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.214
the first quarter was spent

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.815
identifying the challenges

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:50.383
developing relationships and

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:52.051
building a plan. The last six

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:54.253
months the second quarter was a

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.955
bit more operational as we've

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.790
begun the on the ground work.

00:10:57.857 --> 00:10:58.324
But as we enter the third

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:00.092
quarter the three months

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.994
leading up to census day. It's

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:03.863
critical that we pause we

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:05.898
evaluate what is worked what

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.967
hasn't worked and what new

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:08.601
challenges have come up that we

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:10.036
didn't anticipate earlier. And

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.238
improve our plans before moving

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:16.208
forward so it's kind of similar

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:16.842
to what coaches and a team I do

00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:18.144
at halftime. For example today

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.012
we will discuss how to solve an

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:20.613
urgent need. For more census

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:22.048
enumerators who serve an

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:24.150
essential role in contacting

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:26.052
our hard account communities.

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:28.020
While the numerator recruitment

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:28.621
and hiring technically falls

00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.189
under control of the U. S.

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.124
census bureau. This is quickly

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.793
becoming a risk to the entire

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.861
success of the census which is

00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:37.930
a problem for all of us. I hope

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:38.464
to hear that our senses

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.166
partners of the state. Local

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:42.068
and community level will step

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:43.936
up. To help get this effort

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:44.503
back on track so that we can

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.838
all accomplish our goals.

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:48.007
Similarly this is an

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.909
opportunity to learn about what

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:50.509
is working in Long Beach. Or

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:53.879
Los Angeles Orange County and

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:54.447
see if those efforts can be

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:55.081
replicated in other communities

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:58.084
across California. If we're

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.019
going to accomplish this if we

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:00.619
are truly going to critically

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:02.321
evaluate our progress and make

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.156
the improvements necessary to

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:05.925
achieve a complete count. Then

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:07.927
this must be a time for open

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:08.494
and honest communications

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.296
freely given cooperation and

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:13.966
expanded inclusion especially

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:14.633
the potential contributors were

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.068
still on the sidelines. So it's

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:18.304
my hope that today's Frank and

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:18.904
honest conversations will help

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:22.174
us in that effort. Thank you so

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.310
M. member Berman and now let me

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:24.844
turn to our our colleague

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.147
senator Russell. Great thank

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:30.182
you very much. Thank you chair

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:34.153
number again. My other brothers

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.923
appear- I just want to mention-

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.326
center- Bergen night we're on

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:41.927
the Senate budget subcommittee

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:44.163
and I chair that- subcommittee

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.332
number for where we had a lot

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:48.400
of testimony come before us

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:52.104
from organizations community

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:54.173
organizations from really small

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.208
rural towns in central

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.144
California- to the larger

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.214
cities. And our what I remember

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:03.916
distinctly in our conversations

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:06.118
which was why we pushed an

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:08.053
added an additional thirty

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.554
million dollars to the

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:12.024
original- proposed budget. Were

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:13.926
a few things that stand out in

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:15.928
my mind one is that the media

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:18.297
and communications strategy was

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.065
not going to be limited to. The

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.401
usual maybe one or two or three

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.303
languages that there was going

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.305
to be a serious effort to

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:28.374
getting into building language

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.242
capacity in some of our

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:34.013
smallest areas in the state- so

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:36.115
language capacity and the use

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:39.919
of media. Very very local-

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.921
media outlets and

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:44.056
communications methods- had to

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:46.058
be used- and that was one

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:47.927
reason why we needed to push

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.929
for additional funding the

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:52.164
other is examples of the trust

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:54.233
messengers the trust. Is built

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.502
up in certain areas which is

00:13:56.569 --> 00:14:00.105
why I was pushing for- the

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:02.274
schools to get more funding-

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.443
there's not a single community

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.278
in the state that doesn't have

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.347
a school. Is not a single

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:10.216
coming in the state- where

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:12.117
parents don't trust the

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.520
teachers and the administrators

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.088
they rely on them they count on

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:19.959
them. And so communicating a

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:22.094
message of importance and

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:23.929
urgency are on the census-

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:26.465
comes more powerfully through

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.400
these messengers that are

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:30.302
trustworthy along side of

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.371
course our community based

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:36.041
activist- our churches of all

00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:38.110
faiths. There's other ways as

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:38.644
well but I just wanted to

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.312
emphasize those as some

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:46.051
examples today I hope. To get

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.120
up to two things where are we

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:50.289
where do we stand and what we

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:50.856
need to do in the remaining

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:54.026
short time before the census

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:56.095
actually starts- hitting our

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:58.297
our communities and our and our

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.132
residents. I appreciate- that

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:04.069
there could be a lot of phone.

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:06.105
Speeches on the importance of

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:06.672
the senses but I think we're

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:10.209
past that. Everybody knows how

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.278
important the censuses what I

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:14.213
really want to hear today is

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.348
where are we what we need to

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.384
know it's urgent we're really

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.619
down- as assembly member Berman

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.621
said we're really down to the

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:26.191
last- critical moments so- I

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.494
hope that- I know I intend to

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.131
listen- as much as possible.

00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:32.765
And I hope all these issues are

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:34.166
covered thank you very much.

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:36.335
Thank you senator Russell and

00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:38.470
we're pleased to be joined by a

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:42.141

have to pardon my sickness I've

got a little bit of a cold but

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:50.649
I'm really happy to be here and

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:52.217
thank you to senator Umberg and

having me I'm not on the

00:15:56.822 --> 00:15:58.257
committee but it's really great

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:00.159
to be here especially-

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:00.759
representing the thirty third

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.261
Senate district that

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:02.961
encompasses most of Long Beach.

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.596
And southeast LA a where we

hundred days so in the next

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:47.139
Hundred Days a tremendous

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.607
amount of effort and tremendous

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.476
number of resources of both

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:52.611

local communities to make sure

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.281

little later on mentioned

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.588
several times that that one of

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:04.423
our concerns one of my concerns

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.325
and make. Sure that that we

the resources that are going to

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.462
be poured into this effort are

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.364
are going to be used most.

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.400
Ifish efficiently as is

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:16.668

efficiently so having said

census. We've already

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.431
documented our challenges so

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:54.433
now is the time for action and

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.033
thanks to the support of the

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:06.678
campaign. The twenty twenty

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:07.312
census was always going to be a

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:08.747
major challenge which would

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.449
require collaboration and

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.384
strong partnerships. As

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.051
mentioned in past testimony to

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.720

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:16.455
partners locally regionally and

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:16.922
statewide has been a

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.690
cornerstone of the county's

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.592
planning efforts. As outreach

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.728
efforts move forward into

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:24.596
twenty twenty. And implemented

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:25.163
the county will continue to

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.732
work closely with our partners

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.500
including the city of LA. Long

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:43.015
twenty twenty the county will

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:44.616
launch a local comprehensive

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:46.552
multi lingual media marketing

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:52.391

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:54.560
consist of. Paid earns an

programs that belie on census

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.872
data. The size and scale of our

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.674
campaign is directly dependent

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.542
on financial resources and

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:11.143
coordination with the state's

00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:12.644

coordination with the state in

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:18.617
that aspect. The county

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:20.485
recognizes that one of the most

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.487
significant resources are count

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:23.121
our county departments and our

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:24.890
work force with over thirty six

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:26.592
county departments and a

00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:27.192
hundred and thirteen thousand

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.894
employees collectively we have

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:30.796
the capacity. And the resources

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:31.296
to reach our ten million

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:34.633
residents. And educate them on

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.233
the importance of the census

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.835
for example the department of

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.637
public social services touches

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:40.505
nearly three point five million

clients many of them also cover

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:44.543
hard to count populations.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.612
County departments to date have

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:47.145
submitted out reach plan

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:48.480

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:54.519
daily interaction with clients.

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.655
Whether resident is receiving

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:57.255
public health services at a

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.692
assessing the variety of social

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.259
services our county has to

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:02.928
offer. Our dedicated work force

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:04.730
will educate and motivate

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:05.297
residents in the places and

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:10.669
spaces they visit. In January

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:11.303
twenty twenty will also launch

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.671
the county census champion

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.506
program encouraging all our

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:15.107
employees to take the census

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.608
pledge to ensure their

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:17.242
household. Families friends and

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:20.712
communities are counted. The

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:22.648
county is administering a

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:24.716
prophet two thirds of its nine

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:25.350
point four million allocation

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:26.852
from the stent from the state

00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:28.720
for outreach efforts and our

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.856
sixty seven cities and forty

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:31.490
five on a corporate areas that

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.858
have part two count

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:34.826
communities. Fighting

00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:36.595
allocations were based on data

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:37.262
measures develop by both the US

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:38.797
census bureau and the state.

00:21:38.864 --> 00:21:40.866
The county is contracting

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:41.400
directly with two of our

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:43.001
largest hard to count cities

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:43.535
are here with us today Los

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:46.672
Angeles and the city of LA. We

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:47.272
gave the remaining cities the

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:48.974
option to either pull their

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:50.876
resources with the county. And

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:52.911
be eligible for a compliment

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.813
services including digital me

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.882
I'm media took its direct mail

00:21:56.948 --> 00:21:58.717
campaigns are earned and paid

00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:00.786
media out reach. For those

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:01.353
cities that choose to take

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.821
their funding allocations. They

00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:04.790
can develop their own out reach

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:05.390
plans but they have to follow

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:06.925
state and out- county

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.894
requirements this is to speak

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.428
to set certain cities are

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.029
actually kind of. More poise to

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:14.766
implement census out reach so

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:15.400
we wanted to kind of be mindful

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:16.668
that give cities the option. Do

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.937
the digital by that still exist

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.839
in limited access to broadband

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:21.440
internet packing are hard to

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:23.041
count populations. The county

00:22:23.108 --> 00:22:24.943
together with the city

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.577
developed a robust listing of

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.851
where the public can access an

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:34.619

be stopped by train county

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:47.099

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:48.700
state issued cat guidelines

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:50.869

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:52.604
and Cubase sees issued by the

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:53.171
state will have to probably

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:54.906
make modifications to that

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:55.474
program according to how we

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.877
originally envisioned it. The

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:00.712
county wide complete cow

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.018
Higher education subcommittee

00:23:08.987 --> 00:23:10.756
to students and school

00:23:10.822 --> 00:23:11.356
administrators and we're proud

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:11.990
to say that was actually shared

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:15.127
statewide. We will also be

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:16.762
developing and distributing a

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:17.262
tool kit with ideas for

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:18.864
businesses of all sizes on how

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.498
to incorporate the census into

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:20.932
their activities early next

00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:21.533
year will be sharing that with

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.770
our partners in local cities.

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:25.403
We're working closely with our

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.937
unions include the SEIU to

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:28.774
conduct outreach. In

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.307
coordination with the Los

Angeles mayor's office last

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:32.811

00:23:34.846 --> 00:23:35.380
LA county to bring them up to

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:35.947
speed on our local planning

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:38.917
efforts. Together with first

00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:40.786

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:44.890
partners to discuss and share

00:23:44.956 --> 00:23:46.992
our reach targeting are zero to

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:47.626
five population in our case the

00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:50.729
twelfth. For the county these

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:51.329
are the following key issues

00:23:51.396 --> 00:23:52.964
moving forward. Counting the

00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:54.933
homeless population. LA county

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.802
has the highest number. Of

00:23:56.868 --> 00:23:57.302
people experiencing on

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:59.104
sheltered homelessness in the

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:00.972
nation and as such counting the

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:01.506
population will be a major

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:03.074
major challenge under the

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:03.675
census bureau's current plant

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:04.976
operation. He partners

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:07.112

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.982
services authority and C. C. F.

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:13.018

00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:13.685
met with the census bureau to

00:24:13.752 --> 00:24:15.053
learn more about. Their process

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.189
and how we can work together to

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:17.756
address structural barriers

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:18.223
berries to county this

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.092
population. The county is

00:24:21.159 --> 00:24:22.928
appreciated that the state

00:24:22.994 --> 00:24:23.528
yesterday issued their final

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:25.163
requirements and guidelines for

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.900
the C. A. Kays and Q. AC's. The

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:29.467
county will continue to work

00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:31.102
with the state to comply with

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:32.904
these guidelines. To host are

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.840
these locations the total

00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:35.307
number of locations is

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:39.010
dependent on this. Over the

00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:40.979
next fourteen weeks it will be

00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:41.613

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:35.066

its work in six areas. One

00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:13.625
recruiting training and

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:15.460

hard to count our volunteers

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:23.535

the city of Long Beach and our

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.410

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:47.318

outcome of those guidelines we

00:30:03.501 --> 00:30:05.370

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:08.639
principles. So to count

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:09.941
everyone I think our efforts

00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:11.876
began with a commitment to-

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.678
holistic approach- in-

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:15.847
investing the necessary

00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:16.481
resources to reach our entire

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:17.882
community. To that end in

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.984
addition to being the primary-

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:21.953
committed to being a primary

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:23.721
convener. Of over fifty

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:25.723
different organizations and

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.224
complete a locally based

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.859
complete count committee- we

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:29.961
have committed- five hundred

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:31.829
forty thousand dollars. Of from

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:33.731
our own general fund since

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.733
twenty eighteen and leveraging

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.935
obviously the- state funding an

00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:38.569
amount of three hundred twenty

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:41.739
two thousand dollars-

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:42.340
subcontract with our partners

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:44.008
at LA county. The one of our

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:46.210
primary- activities to conduct

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:48.012
out reach to a variety of

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.981
communications. Media including

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.883
digital print radio and

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:53.918
television- as the main

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:54.552
commuter of the complete count

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:56.020
committee we have become the

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:58.155
center. Of the committee's

00:35:58.222 --> 00:35:59.891
communication strategies. And

00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:02.226
we are and that is working very

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:04.028
effectively force we're happy

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:04.662
about the progress that we're

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:06.063
making one that. A to be able

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.832
to support all of our partners

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:09.834
we're particularly proud of-

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:11.836
the outreach plants that have

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:12.336
been submitted and- are

00:36:12.403 --> 00:36:14.238
actively under way with twenty

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:14.739
of our twenty three city

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:17.909
departments. We have stepped up

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:18.442
to offer their visibility

00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:19.844
throughout the community-

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:21.913
interacting with the public. As

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:22.513
a platform for communicating

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.883
important messages about the

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:26.417
senses. The key highlights

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:28.286
include. Strong engages with

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:29.921
our city libraries parks

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:31.989
facilities in advance and

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:32.590
working with our public works

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:34.125
department- to brand

00:36:34.191 --> 00:36:35.927
physicalist infrastructure

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:36.460
throughout the community.

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:38.396
Engage our utility departments

00:36:38.462 --> 00:36:39.931
to send messages to our utility

00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:42.166
bills. In addition- we're very

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:44.168
fortunate to have a partnership

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:44.735
with the Long Beach unified

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:46.170
school district- you'll hear

00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:48.139
from. Later on a different

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:50.207
panel- it's providing us with a

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:52.109
unique opportunity for broad

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:52.710
based region gauge meant give

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:56.113
it C. Y. footprint. So to focus

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.949
in on hard to count populations

00:36:58.015 --> 00:37:00.017
is the essential foundation of-

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:01.919
the city Andy committee

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:02.553
strategy for have a successful

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.322
census. And that that's it's

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:06.357
based on grassroots out reach

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:08.092
via trusted messengers and hard

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:12.196
to count- areas. As the primary

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:13.965
building block of our approach.

00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:16.033
So we're working with-

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.667
committee based in faith based

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:18.235
organizations that provide

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:20.137
support and then- is part of

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:22.406
our- complete count committee.

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:24.375
And we're doing a number of

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:26.243
other things like- we are in

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.179
the process of developing

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:30.014
protocol for recruiting and

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:32.116
training- at least five high

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:34.018
volunteer investors who. In

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:34.452
other- active civic

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:36.153
organizations will be out in

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.955
the community of providing

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:38.556
information about the senses.

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:40.324
We've identified a hundred

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.059
twenty locations- process

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:42.693
actually he asked the question-

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.061
assistance centers

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:45.997
geographically concentrated. In

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:48.099
hard to count areas we also

00:37:48.165 --> 00:37:50.401
are- taking steps to engage our

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:52.269
local ethnic media as a

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:56.007
foundational. Style element of

00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:58.376
our approach- I want to point

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.311
out- that we are in a unique

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:02.346
position to be have one of our

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:04.315
three. Cities in California

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:06.150
have led to its own health

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:08.019
department so we are

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:10.087
leveraging- the capacity of our

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:10.688
health department through the

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:12.023
community services. To

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:12.623
relationships with our hard

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.926
account communities including

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:16.527
but not limited to strategic

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:17.928
planning of our language access

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:18.396
program. Comprehensive

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:20.231
engagement with our Housing

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:20.798
Authority tended in real

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:22.166
property or communities.

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:24.168
Engagement of our- early

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:26.103
childhood education partners

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.372
and- the Long Beach immigrant

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:30.174
rights coalition. Additionally

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:34.445
we're. Utilizing are we gonna

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:35.980
be level leveraging our-

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:38.215
homeless services

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:38.849
infrastructure to partner with

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:40.117
the census bureau to ensure an

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:40.651
effective- account of our

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:42.053
children and children homeless

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:44.321
population- we are really-

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:46.424
another a key aspect of our

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.259
strategy- where we've

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:50.194
identified activities. Is to

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:52.063
have neighborhood based-

00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:54.165
community outreach and so we

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:56.033
have of the fortunate

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.035
opportunity to have. An alumni

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:58.536
network of seven fifty

00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:00.204
neighborhood leaders who went

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:00.771
to our neighbor leadership

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:02.306
program. And we will be

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:04.308
reaching out to them to use

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:06.444
them as a foundation for-

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.345
building our neighborhood

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:10.181
outreach strategies. Hard to

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:14.218
calculus and beyond. On and I

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:16.153
just wanna quickly point out-

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.189
the third- principle that's

00:39:18.255 --> 00:39:18.823
dried our efforts is to nurture

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:22.193
a- local searches work force-

00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:22.827
couple things were doing their

00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:24.428
our workforce development

00:39:24.495 --> 00:39:26.297
agency here with the city

00:39:26.363 --> 00:39:26.831
Pacific gateway workforce

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:28.399
investment- the workforce

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:32.169
investment network. Is a direct

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:34.305
actively- conducting our reach

00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:34.939
the pools of potential census

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:36.340
workers- that process to

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:38.242
provide required skills- to

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.544
attain jobs with the senses

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:42.213
the- in addition they are

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:44.348
collaborating with the- Long

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:46.150
Beach complete count committee

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:46.751
members. Vertically committee

00:39:46.817 --> 00:39:48.285
based organizations develop

00:39:48.352 --> 00:39:48.719
shared messaging our

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.488
strategies. And we expect that

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:52.156
they will be co hosting

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:54.158
recruitment events at different

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:54.725
locations across the city.

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:56.594
We're working with the census

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.429
bureau- two provides the Philly

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.464
space- for training and

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:02.233
recruitment activities- and

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:04.602
then finally I like to. Just

00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:06.370
highlight a couple things. At

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:08.472
the close about how we work is

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.441
strategically- we fully expect

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:12.309
that our committee- will be

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:14.345
using sort to identify

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:16.380
populations in locations for

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:18.215
rappers rapid deployment. Of

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:20.217
resources during issuers- and

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:22.153
non response follow periods.

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:24.155
And our model our collaborative

00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:28.159
model has been centered around-

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:30.528
building a foundation to the

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.429
planning process but as we move

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:32.997
it to if you don't have time

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:36.400
will move it. To the taste

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:37.001
faced. A that we will continue

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:42.406
to bill. The capacities of all

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:43.007
our member organizations add

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:43.474
additional more member

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:44.275
organizations to assess-

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:44.809
without reach as we move

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:45.442
forward and collecting data and

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:46.677
analyze the data to sort we'll

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:47.244
be able to be strategic and

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.813
noble. To deploy resources were

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:50.414
needed throughout the effort-

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:52.416
and finally- we're proud of all

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:54.618
the work excellent let me what

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:55.252
we come back to a little later

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.554
during the- period we were

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:00.424
asking questions so. Already if

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:00.991
you want to just give us one

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:02.526
quick paragraph that be great.

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:04.695
I think- I think that about

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:06.697
sums it up for a you know

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.632
everything's going on Long

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:10.668
Beach I think- you know if I'm

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:12.436
if I could point out that. If

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:14.371
there are some strategic

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:14.872
opportunities for some

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:18.375
additional resources- we would

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:18.976
look forward to having- some

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:20.544
additional support for

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:22.680
technology Tallassee computers

00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:23.280
to support our senses acting

00:41:23.347 --> 00:41:24.715
kiosk. And a questionnaire

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:26.717
systems centers I in addition

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.586
to but potentially some

00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:29.220
additional resources to support

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:35.352
own resources to fund these

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:37.354
efforts. To that end our city

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:39.289
council has allocated a hundred

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:41.491
and twenty five thousand

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:42.092
dollars from our general fund.

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:45.195
Towards this. This funding we

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:47.130
have developed a robust digital

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.132
marketing campaign as well as

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:49.766
funding for census ambassadors

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:53.337
and direct outreach. As a city

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:55.372
wide priority we have also

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:57.507
activated resources from other

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:58.041
departments to expand our

00:47:58.108 --> 00:47:59.509
reach. One of those internal

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:01.411
partners is our library

00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:03.513
department. In partnership with

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.148
the US census bureau and

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.284
library staff we are conducting

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:07.884
twelve informational workshops

00:48:07.951 --> 00:48:11.154
in English Spanish Vietnamese

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:11.788
throughout the month of January

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:15.192
and February of next year. In

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:15.759
addition we have prioritized

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:17.461
our funding to help bridge the

00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:19.529
digital divide by perching

00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:21.298
purchasing additional wifi hot

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:23.233
spots that are available to be

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.302
checked out our library. We

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:25.936
hope that resources like this

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:29.206
will help families complete the

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:29.740
census from the comfort of

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.341
their home if they so choose.

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:33.443
Another key internal partner is

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:35.245
our water division. We're

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:37.247
working together in a joint

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:39.249
campaign titled make it count

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:39.883
to conduct additional outreach

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.652
efforts. With their support we

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:43.487
are not just adding census

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:45.622
messaging to our- water bills.

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:47.457
But we've also developed a

00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:49.426
calendar that will be mailed

00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:49.993
out to all households in the

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.263
city. And this will have

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:53.897
information on key dates from

00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:55.632
the senses as well of as well

00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:57.567
as other key information for

00:48:57.634 --> 00:49:01.438
our city. And we're also

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:05.242
working with our- water

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.809
department and our economic

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:07.611
development division to conduct

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:09.379
direct outreach to our

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:11.248
restaurants and businesses-

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:13.383
they've developed several

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.017
materials for the children of

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:15.452
those restaurants. I was well

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:16.053
as for the general patrons as

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:19.623
well. Moving forward we're

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.692
going to continue to work with

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:23.593
our trusted- with our

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.094
stakeholders and trusted

00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:25.529
partners to promote the

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:27.698
importance of the twenty twenty

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:29.800
census to ensure. That everyone

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:31.568
in Santa Anna's counted. One of

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.470
the city's biggest assets are

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:35.572
sixty four active neighborhood

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.441
associations and we will be

00:49:37.507 --> 00:49:37.941
working with our local

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:39.509
neighborhood leaders to

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:40.010
conduct. Local outreach

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:43.480
throughout the next year. We

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:44.047
are planning to conduct a

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:45.615
series of community block

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.584
parties and community walks and

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:49.353
several of our her two count

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:49.886
communities in the city.

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:51.588
Through funding that we are

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:53.457
anticipating to receive from

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:55.492
the county of orange. However

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.461
we were recently notified that

00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:58.095
we will no longer be receiving

00:49:58.161 --> 00:49:59.629
this funding I will have to

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:01.565
significantly reduce our

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.467
outreach efforts alas

00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:03.967
additional. Dollars are

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.769
received. Nonetheless we will

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.671
continue to prioritize the

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:08.238
twenty twenty census moving

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:13.443
forward. That concludes my

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.077
presentation and I am available

00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:15.445
to answer any questions thank

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:19.616
you mistress of. Before I turn

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.718
it over to my colleagues for

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:23.553
their questions let me just

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.722
point out three areas I'm gonna

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:27.591
ask about giving up to think

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:29.559
about- while others are asking

00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:31.595
their questions our first I'm

00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:33.363
gonna ask each of you what

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.499
additional resources you may

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:37.367
have contributed to the effort

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:37.968
I a note this Long Beach and

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:39.770
Senate has already identified

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.471
some additional resources but-

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.607
like this east each of you.

00:50:43.673 --> 00:50:44.207
What additional resources are

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:45.609
being contributed- what metrics

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:47.878
are performance measures you're

00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:51.415
you're using so for example- I

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:55.685
recall that. Misa de ellos a

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:59.456
Garcia said that a goal of four

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:00.023
hundred goodwill ambassadors

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.892
you've exceeded- wondering what

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:03.560
other metrics each of you are

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:05.362
using performance measure

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:07.364
using. And then what challenges

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:07.998
what your greatest challenge.

00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:09.800
May be separate apart from

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:13.470
funding. We assume that that

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:14.004
everyone needs additional

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:17.474
resources. And so let me. Turn

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:19.509
it over to assembly member

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:20.010
Berman since you're out

00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:21.812
numbered four to one here I

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:23.647
thought maybe I didn't. That

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.782
opportunity to ask questions

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.384
they thank you senator Umberg

many as family members and

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:31.888
senators- I commend the Senate.

00:51:31.955 --> 00:51:33.557

little we're always were much

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.794
more engaged in the assembly

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:39.896

can't I. Can't we care more I

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:45.469
can't argue with the obvious

00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:46.036
okay are you there may there

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:47.537
are those right so- so couple

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.706
you mentioned that you're

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.608
hiring commuting back are not

00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:52.242
hiring the recruiting volunteer

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:53.543
community ambassadors- to

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.745
participate- center Amberg

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:59.483
reference a second ago. Our I

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:00.116
guess the question is are any

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:01.585
of those ambassadors also

00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:03.787
applying to be raiders or

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:05.622
helping in the Newman.

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.824
Recruitment could I know that's

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:08.458
an area that were falling short

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:11.661
across the state. Then and then

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:15.899
a lot. Of folks reference the

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:16.399
questionnaire assistance

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:19.703
centers. He asked and different

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:20.203
plans that you have an

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:21.805
identifying locations for those

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:22.372
how are those locations are

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:23.840
gonna be advertised to your

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:24.407
residence to make sure that

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:25.876
they know where they can go or

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:27.811
is the hope that they're just

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.980
so- you know it the spread out

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:31.781
everywhere that people are will

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:32.382
bump into them without even

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:33.783
meaning to- which would be a

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.819
good thing and I should say I

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:37.921
was really happy to hear a lot

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.556
about some of the- the kind of

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.491
PR efforts that folks are doing

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:42.125
whether it was garbage trucks

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:45.762
or- lampposts or other things

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:46.363
because my hope is that. You

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:49.499
know we count I count signs are

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:51.501
so ubiquitous across California

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.503
that everyone just feels like

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.104
it's something that everyone

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:55.639
else is doing and that there's

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.474
no risk to it so it sounds like

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:58.074
a lot of folks. Creative ideas

00:52:58.141 --> 00:53:05.482
to make that happen. I can

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:06.116
answer the question I have for

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:08.118
LA county in regards to the

00:53:08.184 --> 00:53:09.920
census action kiosk and kind of

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:11.488
how. How we plan to advertise

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:13.590
and- early on in the process

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:14.190
of. I. LA county with our

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:16.026
colleagues the valley we agreed

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.494
that we would develop a CAC

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:18.161
locator tool that would be able

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:20.030
to push out so that people can.

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:23.700
Find the closest Q. a C. will

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:24.334
also make sure that we provide

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:25.869
that information to our two one

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:27.704
one line we anticipate that

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:28.204
people are going to have

00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:29.673
questions about the census and

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:30.307

prepared- it also Ted make sure

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.579
that that line that assistance

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:37.647
is provided in language. It

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:38.181
also be something that we

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:39.749
according to our media campaign

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:41.718
but we did think about that we

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:43.720
did want to have one central

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:44.287
place where people can find

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:45.755
those. Locations red. And for

00:53:45.822 --> 00:53:47.657
the city of Los Angeles. This

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:49.926
in terms of the ambassadors and

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:52.028
how. Are they learning about

00:53:52.095 --> 00:53:53.863
the enumerator jobs that are

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:55.732
available with the US census

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.734

of our senses a recruitment and

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.607
training events and if they

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:05.609
have gladly accepted each of

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:07.611
those opportunities- we also

00:54:07.677 --> 00:54:08.211
provide the- opportunity to

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:10.013
make a page before and after

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.915
trainings. So they are well

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:15.785
integrated into our program. As

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:17.687
far as promoting this census

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:18.321
action kiosk located within the

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:21.825
city of Los Angeles we are in

00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:23.693
addition to working with the

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.227
county of Los Angeles to.

00:54:24.294 --> 00:54:26.096
Create the locator tool we're

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:29.766
also gonna be utilizing our

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:30.333
senses goodwill ambassadors

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.002
during the non response follow

00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:33.837
up period and are canvassing

00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:35.872
get out the count efforts. To

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:37.907
inform local residents about

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.843
the census action kiosks around

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:41.811
their neighborhood so that.

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:44.047
They know where to go where in.

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:47.917
If they do not have access to a

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:50.186
internet ready device either

00:54:50.253 --> 00:54:52.222
computer tablet or phone. Or

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:54.224
just feel more comfortable

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.026
going to a location where they

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:57.827
might be able to obtain

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:58.461
language assistance or digital

00:54:58.528 --> 00:55:00.030
literacy assistance. I and then

00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:02.065
finally we're gonna be

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:05.935
incorporated senses. Kiosk

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:09.806
messages into our advertising

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:11.875
campaign so that they'll be the

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:13.977
messages where a we are

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:15.879
specifically promoting the

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:16.513
census action kiosks and how to

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:23.953
access the locator tool. So on

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.156
one beach we are also going to

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:29.826
be using- the locator tool-

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:30.493
we're going to for marketing or

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.262
chaos but in addition to that

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:34.130
incorporating information about

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:36.066
our kiosk in- all our multi

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:38.168
media outreach efforts-

00:55:38.234 --> 00:55:41.971
digital- print- and so forth

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:44.007
but I think what's going to be

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:44.541
most effective for us in

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:47.877
marketing are and- our kiosk is

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:49.813
all the direct out reach with-

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.948
are masters- beat out in the

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:52.515
community. And hopefully our

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:54.150
neighborhood leaders- dispersed

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:56.019
throughout the city- that have

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:56.653
existing relationships with the

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.823
communities- that those- chaos

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:00.423
will be in I think the school

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:02.258
district is going to provide us

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:03.893
a really good opportunity- to

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.829
because they're contributing-

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:07.897
several of the- the kiosk to

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:09.833
their relationships to-

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:11.901
directly market those- the

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:16.039
kiosks in terms of. Promoting

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:16.539
the census jobs- we are

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:19.943
certainly- directing- that-

00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:21.911
messaging towards our

00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:24.180
ambassadors- and in a and then

00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:26.216
also to- we're actually also

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:28.318
thinking about the idea of

00:56:28.384 --> 00:56:30.186
providing that information to

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:32.021
our city employees who. Might

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:33.923
be looking for other

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.025
opportunities as well. So yeah.

00:56:36.092 --> 00:56:40.463
Thanks. So the county of orange

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:41.998
is actually working- in

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:45.835
conjunction with the- US census

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:48.004
bureau in relation to working

00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:48.571
to get enumerators so we've

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:50.206
been advertising in our county

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:53.943
publications your HR rep-

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.012
avenues some on Arlington pages

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:58.181
on all the social media outlets

00:56:58.248 --> 00:57:00.049
to ensure that there is a good

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:02.118
deal of coverage in relation

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:04.254
that- obviously also made a

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.955
pitch to our county employees

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:06.556
or internal publication stern

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:08.358
sure there may be some part

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:10.193
time opportunities for them to

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.028
come in New as a numerators if

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:12.629
they have any colleagues or

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:14.297
friends are such that might be

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:16.032
looking for positions. So we

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:16.666
work very closely with our our

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:20.003
colleagues there as far as- the

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.637
queue a season such obviously

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:23.940
were were- curing up in

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:24.507
relation to that to actually

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:26.242
launch that into our family

00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:28.244
resource centers are libraries

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:30.113
and such but there will be a

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:30.747
very much a big courted offered

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.415
once we do get off the ground

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:34.083
and get approval for our

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.119
grassroots efforts will be

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:36.719
working with our vendors to

00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:38.321
actually launch that to make

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:40.089
sure we publicize and be

00:57:40.156 --> 00:57:40.723
working very closely with the

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:42.392
CEO communication office my

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:44.127
office in particular. I'm sure

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:46.095
we have a great deal of

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:46.496
coverage as far as

00:57:46.563 --> 00:57:54.037
communications concerned. The

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:56.272
bulk of the queue a season the

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:58.208
city of Santana will be placed

00:57:58.274 --> 00:57:59.943
our community centers

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:02.011
throughout the city. As well as

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:02.512
additional- government

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:04.280
buildings we will be placing

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:06.082
this information and our

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:08.318
community resource guides and

00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:10.119
recreation pressures that go

00:58:10.186 --> 00:58:12.388
out- to all of our household

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:14.290
who'll be. Also placing this

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:17.961
information online- regarding

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:20.029
the census jobs and our

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:22.031
ambassador program so most of

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:22.599
our senses ambassadors are

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.200
actually our neighborhood

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:26.135
association leaders- and some

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:28.137
of those already have full time

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:30.106
jobs but we are inviting and we

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:31.941
have invited in the past the US

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.977
census bureau. I'm too common

00:58:34.043 --> 00:58:35.945
table with us at events and

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:36.579
those have been very successful

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:42.151
thus far. Thank you. Thank you

00:58:42.218 --> 00:58:42.752
seven member Berman center the

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:48.358
Russell. Thank you very much I

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:50.159
just want to follow up on the

00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:52.328
issue of the hiring of

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:56.165
enumerators- it seems to me

00:58:56.232 --> 00:58:56.799
there's some effort but I'm not

00:58:56.866 --> 00:59:00.136
quite sure. How formal and how

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:00.737
big of a of an effort how big

00:59:00.803 --> 00:59:04.107
of a push it is to use all of

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:06.142
our resources to make sure we

00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:08.244
hire- that's what we referring

00:59:08.311 --> 00:59:10.079
to right we say enumerators

00:59:10.146 --> 00:59:12.048
they're the full time-

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:12.582
ambassadors are more the

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:16.219
volunteers. Right just just to

00:59:16.286 --> 00:59:16.886
be clear on the on the terms so

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:20.056
just in terms of the LA county-

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:22.292
you mentioned- a little bit

00:59:22.358 --> 00:59:24.260
about maybe using a human

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:26.362
resources but- is that possible

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:28.431
to use it in a much more

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:32.201
direct. All full way- the way

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:36.072
some of the other- departments

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:36.539
are being used I know

00:59:36.606 --> 00:59:38.074
department social services I

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:40.176
think you- was mentioned that-

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:42.345
you can use the full scope of

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:46.149
the of the agency so can't you

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:46.716
made resources or maybe the

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:50.086
registrar of voters be used in

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:52.255
a much more forceful complete

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:54.257
way to find. Enumerator

00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:58.161
enumerator applicants. And

00:59:58.227 --> 01:00:00.129
overall just can we use. Of

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:02.465
current resources right now to

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:02.932
get the most number of

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:06.336
enumerators. So in my in my

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.404
remarks senator I mentioned

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:10.273
that- our county department

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:10.707
we'd axis currently

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.342
coordinating six events but

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:14.277
what I didn't say is then just

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.212
start in December it had

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.247
actually see I have previous

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:18.815
events to existing kind of

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:20.483
events we've been in including

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.385
census I. jobs messaging that's

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.253
part of it. The other part is

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.189
kind of making connections with

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:26.789
those applicants that come

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:28.358
through our county- either

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.360
contractors or through our

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:32.195
departments to make that

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:32.762
connection with jobs making

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:34.330
sure that we push those

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:36.265
messages out- another component

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:38.067
of that is also a media

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:40.069
strategy including our-

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:40.703
websites as well as pushing out

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.472
to social media. That's just a

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.507
piece or a component of it and

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:46.476
the other part that we're

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:48.244
asking our departments I had to

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.146
do was to come up with kind of

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:50.747
unique areas that we can push

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.081
it out whether it's through

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:52.682
partnerships with our cities

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:54.484
but also with our and with our

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.552
county departments. So it's not

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:58.654
just I know I mentioned the six

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:00.456
events happening but this I

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:02.658
want to make it clear that it's

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.460
been happening over the past

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:08.164
kind of. Six months. And do you

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:10.299
do you. Have any way of gauging

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:12.602
do we have. Sufficient are we

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:14.370
meeting some are there some the

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.672
goal. As far as the number to

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:18.574
be hired I know you don't do

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:20.543
the hiring but- I do you have

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.345
any way of gauging are we where

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:24.514
we need to be. In order to

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.482
reach. So many hard to count

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:28.418
Bob I think that's kind of the

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:29.085
difficulty for LA county is one

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:30.386
of the things that we're doing

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.288
and we have a meeting scheduled

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:32.955
with. The US census bureau to

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.557
kind of see how we could be

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.192
more helpful to kind of. Hit

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:36.793
those targets we know what

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:37.360
their goal is we know that

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:38.461
there are 30% of their hiring

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.630
goal. But I think that's kind

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:42.298
of where the partnership with

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.300
the US census bureau would come

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:44.834
in so that we can kind of.

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:45.401
Develop some metrics in each

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:50.273
of. The past. Okay yes and one

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:50.873
more question after you thank

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.608
you okay well I can I can offer

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.477
some comments about that- the

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:58.214
in order to recruitment we are-

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.216
specifically are having gazed

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:00.750
are- workforce development

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:04.220
agency Pacific gateway- to-

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.289
develop an excuse tragedies to

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:06.923
in partnership with the census

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.658
bureau- to help out with the

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:10.359
numerator recruitment we are

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.562
actively working with assisted

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.363
payroll to identify training

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.432
recruitment space in our city

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:18.267
facilities to host events- in

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.203
partnership with the bureau-

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.736
our workforce development

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:24.207
agencies acts is actively-

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.209
analyzing pools of existing-

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.444
job seekers- within their

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:30.346
current network- it for

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.582
potential- employer. Is between

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.650
toys for the senses that they

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:38.387
can actually train and referred

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:40.389
to the bureau for jobs. So that

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:42.391
is sort of the primary way that

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.227
we're doing our recruitment

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:46.362
for- at the numerators in the

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:46.963
city of Long Beach. It's one

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:50.399
more one more question is of we

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:52.435
all know that this environment-

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.570
that our immigrant communities

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:56.539
whether. Citizens or legal

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:58.574
residents run document doesn't

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.610
really matter you know our in

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:06.315
the- a- mixed emotions about

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:06.883
how to how much to trust

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:10.319
government- we had an issue

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:12.522
with our D. M. V. and the

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:14.357
sharing of information so. Can

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:16.425
you just tell me I know that's

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:20.296
not your sole responsibility we

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:20.663
have a media and

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.465
communications- part of the

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.634
strategy but how do you

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:28.371
especially Los Angeles county.

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.239
And Orange County how do you

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.308
sort of see our response or-

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:36.379
our communications are out

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.648
there to up to the issue of.

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:44.387
Immigration status- or our

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:46.389
communities to feel secure and

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:50.393
confident to up participate. I

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:50.993
can address this at least in

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.495
terms of addressing it when I

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:53.129
dressed our county departments

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:54.630
what I what I had text

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:56.532
expressed our county

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:58.568
departments is- the state of

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.336
California in LA county

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.471
specifically has shown to our

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:02.939
undocumented immigrant

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.707
populations that were there to

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.676
support them they've- we've

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:08.644
created the LA justice find out

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:10.413
in partnership with the city of

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.415
LA- additionally the board of

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:13.049
supervisors created the office

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.550
of immigrant affairs so I feel

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.352
even though we talk about trust

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:16.953
messengers often we're talking

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.688
about. CBO's I would argue that

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:20.556
and the county- it's also

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:22.558
county departments it's where

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:24.360
they go whether it's through

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:24.961
the library they take their

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.329
children there after it's our

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:26.929
health department so I think

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.598
we're cooperating a lot of that

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:30.566
message Jean and our touches-

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.468
and that is. Tied into our I.

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.337
county wide campaign the other

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:36.339
component for us- we also have

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:36.939
our office of M. good affairs

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:38.774
who who's kind of messaging

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.443
these to the various- CBO's

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:42.345
that we work with and also

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:42.979
that's what we're going to hear

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.647
from anyone if we start to kind

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:45.248
of hear misinformation they're

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:46.616
going to come to our office.

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:47.116
And I'm gonna fairs and

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:48.684
hopefully we can take that

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:49.218
message and work with our

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:50.720
partners whether it's with the

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:52.555
city or with C. CF to kind of

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:53.222
develop that and I think that's

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:54.724
where the collaborations gonna

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:56.492
be especially once we get to

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.093
the non response fallible be

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.494
hearing some of those things

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.429
and partner. From from the

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:01.130
community along as well as with

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.732
the state I think that's where

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:04.433
for us it's going to be key is

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.034
coordinating our messaging not

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.836
only with you know our cities

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:10.640
with C. CF as as well as the

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:11.240
states about world coordinate

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:16.545
in that regard. No just add on

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:17.179
the in the city of Los Angeles

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:18.714
in just reiterate as well. That

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:20.616
we recently held a briefing for

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:21.183
the consular corps in Los

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.852
Angeles- to brief them. On the

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:24.920
county wide efforts happening

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.789
here in Los Angeles and- get.

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:30.459
Their enlistment to help with

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.027
out reach especially with

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.762
nationals that go and seek

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.830
services. To their consulates-

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:38.601
directly. We're also. Working

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:39.135
with our senses goodwill

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:42.471
ambassadors and a- great many

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.473
deliver them- don't have

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.107
citizenship status and that's

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:46.642
because we've made. The

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.577
requirements to be a CGA very

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.479
flexible the only requirement.

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:54.483
Is to be. Los Angeles. To have

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:55.117
the event in the city of Los

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:56.719
Angeles and to be eighteen

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.554
years and older. So again

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.756
citizenship status or status in

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.525
the US is not a requirement to

01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:02.992
be a census goodwill

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.760
ambassador- and we have been

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.729
able to do that- through the- a

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.564
private funds that we've

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:08.998
received through the

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:10.733
foundation. Out in also up to-

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.868
piggy back on the point of

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:14.637
young was making is that-

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.806
utilizing. Our infrastructure

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:18.874
both in the- county of Los

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:20.876
Angeles and in the city where

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:21.510
we have the mayor's office of

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:22.678
immigrant affairs. That works

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.747
directly with community based

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:25.314
organizations that service

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:26.615
immigrant populations. Out and

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.951
we've worked very closely with

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.686
some of the states a statewide

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.855
contracted partners like cheap

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:34.623
Lara. And the label to hold.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.692
Out reach advanced to immigrant

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:38.461
communities to begin putting

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:39.028
out messaging. Around the

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:42.798
importance of participating in

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:43.366
being counted in the twenty

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:46.736
twenty census. Yes I'll I'll

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.704
just have to do our our

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:49.271
department of health office

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.773
equity- we do have strong

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.541
relationships with- the

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:54.710
immigrant and- and document

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.712
community- and particularly

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:58.481

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.487
we've been actively working.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.589
With those organizations- with

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:07.256
a couple outcomes with stops to

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:08.724
Long Beach justice fun. On the

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.760
Long Beach values axle the

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:12.495
strength of our relationship

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:12.962

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:18.534
good- another key indicator of

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:19.101
how we're working with our

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:20.836
immediate community. They are

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:22.905
actually a part of our complete

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:24.640

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:48.597
hesitant to talk to county

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:49.064
governments are city

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.599

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.580
our trusted messenger so we're

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:05.147
looking to leverage. Those

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:06.882
relationships that some of our

01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:08.784
our constituents have with some

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:09.385
of our of our folks that are

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:10.886
actually in the community

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:12.755
helping provide services and

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:13.389
such. But the trusted messenger

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:14.990
component is very important as

01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:16.892
well and we understand that

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:18.694
that's going to be the way that

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.696
way in- they how those

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:21.297
relationships there fomented

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.998
them over the years they've

01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:24.767
there's now a trusted component

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:26.969
there. So we're very cognizant

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.104
of where our weaknesses are as

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.706
far as doing the outreach and

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:31.340
the and the communication would

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.808
differ constituencies. So the

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:34.777
county is working to leverage

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.745
all of our grassroots advocacy

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:37.413
components that are actually in

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.014
the community that are seen as

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.749
trusted messengers to help-

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.685
advocate and make sure that

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:45.020
these folks that are in those

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.856
hard account areas. Fill out

01:08:46.922 --> 01:08:53.028
their census forms. The city of

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.763
Santana has identified this as

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:56.799
a tremendous challenge since

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.701
the beginning of our efforts.

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:01.070
As a sanctuary city we have a

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.938
century advisory round table-

01:09:03.005 --> 01:09:05.007
that has come together. And we

01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:07.143
are taking advantage of these

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.011
community partners- and there

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:11.146
were working with them and with

01:09:11.213 --> 01:09:12.882
our Mexican consulate's office-

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:15.017
to come up with additional

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:16.719
messaging have a specifically

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:19.154
targeting- the myths regarding

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:20.990
the citizenship question. That

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:23.158
was up there because some folks

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.860
still think it's going to be on

01:09:24.927 --> 01:09:26.795
there. And also just-

01:09:26.862 --> 01:09:28.864
reiterating that their data

01:09:28.931 --> 01:09:30.900
safe- as you mentioned the-

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.968
incident that happened with the

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:34.870
DMV didn't help our case- so

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:37.072
we're gonna all. Just continue

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:38.807
to move that message forward.

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:39.408
And we've been working with

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:41.310
staff from the county of orange

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:44.813
to come up with a joint- info

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.481
graphic on that we can display

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:47.149
throughout the entire county.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.118
Just indicating what happens to

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:51.186
your data once you respond to

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:53.155
the census. And that they can

01:09:53.222 --> 01:09:55.224
see that on this will not be

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:55.758
able to come back and be

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:57.226
tracked to them. We're hoping

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:59.161
that that will be helpful and

01:09:59.228 --> 01:09:59.762
we'll have that in a series of

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:05.000
languages as well. Thank you

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:08.804
Senate also center pan. Thanks

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:09.405
very much us our number you

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:11.240
know I think all the presenters

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.808
I know that the amount of time

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:13.342
we give you. I was not in

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:15.010
that's really tough to. Cover

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:17.146
everything you're doing and-

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:20.816
so- but- I. Think the idea was

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:21.350
to get the highlights and

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:22.985
certainly any material can send

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.187
us about some other activities

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:26.956
is always welcome- first a

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:29.191
couple comments and then a

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.993
couple questions- so first of

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.228
all- children her when the

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:35.097
group's that's- hard to count-

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:37.166
some hoping that in the

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:39.068
messaging that's going out to

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:39.702
everyone I know people working

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:41.236
with we came from schools in

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:42.905
the first five and so forth.

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:43.539
But also just kind reminding

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:45.374
people that if there's children

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.276
household the need to count

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:48.911
them right now they need so.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:49.511
Hopefully that's part of the

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:51.080
regular messaging and also

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:53.015
given some people. Some

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:53.549
guidance as to the house

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:55.250
basically just remember you

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.086
know you just you can yourself

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:59.054
but you also need to. There's

01:10:59.121 --> 01:10:59.722
kids in the household sure you.

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:01.190
But the man they're all the

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:03.259
kids. Right the other thing is

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:05.160
I know that many of you

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:05.794
mentioned- you know you're safe

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:07.162
secure a season so for them

01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:09.198
hoping that- the state folks

01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:11.100
that we can actually- and you'd

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:12.935
mentioned you have a- locator.

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:13.469
App I'm hoping that were

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:15.137
everyone's entree develop their

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.239
own. Maybe we can the state

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:19.241
should do that and we have a

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:21.176
statewide database of all the

01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:21.744
curious use and so forth so

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.345
anyone who's wherever they are

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:25.247
could actually. Intentionally

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:27.116
pull up and out and find it I

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:29.084
know many people use mobile in

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:29.718
people who do have access often

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:31.553
be. Particular income just need

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.188
to have mobile that honestly

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:33.789
have desktop or something so.

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:35.524
Again trying to be sure that

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:37.626
that that information's easily-

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:43.032
obtained in this M. the symbol.

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:47.336
A couple questions. First is

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:47.970
about language access- you'll

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.304
for the API community

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:49.905
particular but also for many

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:50.506
other communities language is

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:51.440
an issue. We know there's

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:53.275
several languages that are you

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:53.942
know in the part of the census

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:55.511
program and the senses of. I

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:57.279
guess what I'm asking and ask

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.248
about is the ones that aren't.

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:01.483
Right you know the ones that

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.218
are the top five or even the

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:05.621
top ten. Okay and we're talking

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:09.291
with the hard to count so- and-

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:11.393
so what is being done to reach

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.228
out to communities were

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:13.829
speaking. I would say fairly

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:17.366
rare languages okay. And trying

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:18.000
to figure out how do we get to

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.702
those communities- some of them

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:21.537
de languages may not

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:23.238
necessarily. Really have a

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:25.240
written form it's merely or all

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:25.908
other types of things so you're

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:27.242
not going to hit him in mass

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:29.478
media. They may not they may or

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:31.246
may not be in social media out

01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:31.847
there or not going to be hit

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:33.615
but the- you know that they're

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.350
not want. Qualified census

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.486
languages. What are you doing

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:39.388
to try to help and they may not

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:41.323
necessarily. Cluster all in one

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.924
geographic area either to be

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:45.394
scattered. In you know and

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:47.296
obviously- L. A.'s certainly a

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:47.863
melting well the salad over

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.565
some feeling multi pot. Garden

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.734
salad of you know only rightly

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.602
cultures. So can Jean maybe

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:57.239
speak to particularly languages

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:59.541
that are. Fairly infrequent

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:00.175
that are not the main which is

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:01.844
are the top five that you're

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:07.483
what were you doing to reach.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:08.050
Out to those communities and

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:11.386
provided language support.

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:11.987
Suffer the LA county most of

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.355
what we're you know we're

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:13.989
contracting two thirds of that

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:14.523
so we're working with the

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:15.190
cities to meet that but what we

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:15.858
looked at internally I mean one

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:17.359
of the reasons we have so many

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:17.926
Q. A. seizing and Q. eight

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:19.795
cases. We don't know if people

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.363
are gonna be driven there so

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.964
we're trying to cover all the

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.365
places that they potentially

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:25.701
will be. And to cover all those

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.436
languages like we're trying to

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.538
look where we have county staff

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:30.105
who speak that language for

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:31.473
example our department public

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.040
social service but there's a

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:33.842
big gap so one of the things

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.377
that we looked at is-

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:36.011
contracting with the language

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.846
line this is. A service that is

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.414
used in our health centers in

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:40.015
our public health centers to

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:41.650
offer that translation service

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:43.519
which would go beyond the

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:45.354
threshold languages. So that is

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:45.988
kind of a resource because for

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:47.689
us I think it's- in terms of

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.591
value in kind of the dollars

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:51.460
that we have limited. It is-

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:52.060
what we're looking for that's

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.762
kind of how the LA county is

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:54.396
going to be addressing it at

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.864
some of our Connie locations.

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:57.566
On the other thing I just

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:58.167
wanted to mention because we

01:13:58.233 --> 01:13:59.735
talked about the CAC locator

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:01.603
tool. I did want to say

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:03.539
obviously our locations are

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:04.206
gonna be uploaded into sword so

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.841
that would be what information

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:06.442
if we're not going to just do

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:07.876
our own thing and then. I'm not

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.945
have that information available

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:10.579
statewide so I just wanted to

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:11.747
clarify that. The other thing

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:13.882
in and understanding that is

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.818
really important for us to go

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.753
where people are. Here at the

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.555
county what we're looking at is

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:23.559
also- developing mobile kiosk

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:24.193
where we would actually go J.

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.894
events so what we're doing

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.629
between January through the end

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:28.263
of the response rate or working

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:29.698
with all our county

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.867
departments. Our board office

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.769
is to identify kind of the

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:37.739
locations were hard. Counter.

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:38.307
Where do we already have. A

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:39.908
presence. And what can we go

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:40.509
to. Because I think that it's

01:14:40.576 --> 01:14:42.010
going to be key. Is reaching

01:14:42.077 --> 01:14:42.611
out to them where they're at

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:43.846
not necessarily hoping that we

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:44.479
drive them to our libraries are

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:45.814
drive into health clinics. The

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:46.481
idea is. When they're there. We

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:47.916
can make a contact engage maybe

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.952
engagement courage and Kerr Jim

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:50.586
to fill out the census that is

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:53.822
one way. Really we realize that

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:54.456
we have to also complement that

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:55.090
with going out to where they're

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:58.060
at. And for the city of Los

01:14:58.126 --> 01:14:59.962
Angeles I think M. were really

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:01.930
taking this as part of a three

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.799
pronged strategy one. Is by-

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:06.101
this is where our partnership

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.836
with the Los Angeles regional

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:09.771
census table is really. Going

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.807
to be critical because- I will

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.009
be promoting all of the partner

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:15.844
hot lines that have- them in

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:16.311
operation during the-

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:18.180
activation period in making

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:20.182
sure that- if somebody needs to

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:22.317
be. Directed to a particular

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:24.119
language line where they do

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.021
have that language expertise

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.890
that we're promoting- that

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:30.025
hotline- we're also going to

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:31.960
be- including. The link which

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:32.594
guides that have been developed

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.263
by the US census bureau and

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:35.797
fifty nine different languages-

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.866
in our- questioner. In our

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.801
senses action kiosk locations

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.803
and providing them an outreach

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.404
events that we attend. There's

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:43.906
more to Steven languages in LA

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:47.843
right. Yes yes. I and then we

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.912
are also through our- senses

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:50.512
goodwill ambassadors programs

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:52.180
does since is good with a

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:53.982
masters that. Speak unique

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:55.951
languages- we're gonna be

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:57.986
tapping them to. Have them

01:15:58.053 --> 01:16:01.857
lead- events where they are the

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:03.859
trusted messenger in about and

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.794
ambassador to their community-

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:10.165
to. Inform people of the twenty

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:15.837
twenty census in their language.

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:17.973
So we currently have a language

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.808
access program that provides

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:22.010
interpretation and- translation

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:24.112
services for- for any language-

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:26.214
if you will with the core.

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:28.150
Language is being- comite to

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:31.887
Golic- in Spanish- or the

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:33.989
principal languages- that are

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.791
of concern to our community.

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:38.060
The comite is of particular

01:16:38.126 --> 01:16:40.062
concern to us- because is not

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:41.797
one of the primary our priority

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:43.899
languages. And Long Beach has a

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:44.366
significant Cambodian

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.803
population. So we are

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:49.938
prioritizing resources to make

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:52.040
sure that- we do you know

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:52.607
direct out reach out to that

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.142
segment of our community-

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.011
through ethnic media outlets we

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:58.046
have one here- and- working

01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:01.883
with arc Cambodian community to

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:06.188
assist with. I think you. Just

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:08.023
doesn't brief follow up so you

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.590
could you a large committee

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:10.158
population in Long Beach. Is

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:10.659
obviously M. does other

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.227
Cambodia populations across the

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:15.831
state- is there any

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:16.365
conversation again we see

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:18.100
people haven't had a chance to

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:20.135
talk yet but- to take okay well

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:22.204
since. Long Beach has a large

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:24.039
committee population develop

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:25.974
materials whatever out reach

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.976
that that's that available to

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:28.610
other places that may not have

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:30.078
larger they have me a small.

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:32.047
Cambodian populations but may

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:32.614
not because they're smaller

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:34.182
don't have this many resources

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:36.151
to so like are we to exchanging

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:38.020
or trading information with

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:40.022
other. Places so I would

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:40.655
imagine Long Beach by take the

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:41.123
lead on the Cambodian

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:43.992
population. Yeah absolutely we

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:44.559
are certainly willing to do

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.161
that I'm not aware of any

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:48.263
contact that we've had with any

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:48.797
other communities in that

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:52.134
regard but however. On it's a

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.102
very good point- we were very

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.736
well resource that area and so

01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:56.405
we would be willing to offer

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:58.240
our support okay what so that I

01:17:58.306 --> 01:17:58.774
think that would be so

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.108
hopefully some there be a

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:02.110
conversation. About that

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.212
because at. In for example I

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:05.981
know that- some of the- of

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:07.949
Pacific Islander population I

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:08.583
guess represents what point 4%

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:12.087
I saw in the- thing- you know

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:14.156
like Samoan vis a fourth. Out

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:14.689
so who's gonna develop the

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:16.258
materials for that and do we

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:18.226
need every hello this every

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:20.095
single county develop their own

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:22.197
or can we find a way to. Where

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:24.099
there's local areas that may

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:26.201
have a larger community where

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:26.735
they may have be able to

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:28.236
because they have. Those

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:30.372
relationships than help use

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.107
those materials that can help

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:32.741
other places than say well we

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.543
don't have as much of a- you

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:36.178
know relationship or the

01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:37.946
committee's much smaller

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:40.148
commuter area but then we have

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.184
materials we can use our our

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.419
our- you know. Advice they can

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.354
give to do that so hopefully

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:48.190
we're creating some sort of

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:50.092
learning collaborative or

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:50.692
something about that- for and

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:52.427
in in date. I believe in and

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.229
maybe the sticking cracked me

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:56.031
later that I think part of that

01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:58.033
is Steve Craig partner portal

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.102
would be able to share some of

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:00.735
those materials that probably

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:02.504
would be a good resource for us

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:08.143
collectively. And share. The

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:08.777
material look at the same yes I

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:12.280
think the. That was the

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:16.118
intention of that I think. I

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:16.718
think you and I the deadline

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.253
the electorate's county yeah

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:18.854
colleagues as well thank you

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.055
senator pan- obviously at

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:20.655
working as a communicator in

01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:21.289
the in the county of orange and

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:21.790
the need to have things

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:22.257
translated in multiple

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:22.824
languages or is incredibly

01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:23.425
important- within the county

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:24.459
itself we obvious people of

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:25.060
speak Farsi Spiegel different

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:28.029
types of Chinese. Commands the

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:28.530
other one we do have a

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.098
Cambodian population as well so

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:30.665
we would love to have that

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:32.467
support we do have interpreters

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.436
are on staff whether they be

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:36.037
work for the social services

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:36.605
agency and have translation

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:38.373
components we have an outside

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.308
translating- service that we

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:42.177
actually have at the county-

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:44.379
the big the most important

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:44.946
thing for me is obvious I'm

01:19:45.013 --> 01:19:46.414
getting it right and writing

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.116
but for people there on the

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:48.717
ground. That they have those

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:50.318
cultural norms cyclical

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:50.852
sensitivities to actually

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:52.320
communicate effectively is

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:52.888
gonna be the most important

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.422
thing so as you can imagine I

01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:56.458
am not gonna be an expert on

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.059
understanding all the cultural

01:19:58.126 --> 01:19:58.593
norms and subsidies ages

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.395
whatever whatever needs to

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.430
occur. But I want to insure as

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:04.366
as whatever documents we get

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.334
are are done correctly and-

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:08.036
looked over in message tested

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:10.172
and such on those lines so any

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.240
resources we have the hive mind

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:14.109
the that their communities and

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:14.743
such would be great as you can

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:18.046
imagine even the different-

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:24.152
constituencies across it. From

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:26.555
so as well so we would love to

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:28.356
have that support and we look

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:28.990
to see what we can do to ensure

01:20:29.057 --> 01:20:29.524
that the messaging is done

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:34.296
effectively. The city of

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:36.231
Santana has access to

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:38.433
translation services in Spanish

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.435
and Vietnamese when we need

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:42.470
access to census material in

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:44.206
other languages. We have

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:44.839
reached out to our partners at

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:46.208
the county of orange- but it

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:48.476
that is for some of those

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:50.445
common languages like Chinese

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.247
husband really hopeful that

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:52.914
materials that we- receive from

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.683
them. In that language- but to

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.618
echo Molly's comment that would

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.453
be great if the state

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.222
prioritized. You know. Bob

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:02.257
putting out information that

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:04.359
any city or county could use-

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:06.461
in multiple language in that

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.463
way we can ensure that state

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:08.964
wide we have a clear and

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:12.267
consistent message. Okay no I

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:14.169
did have a second question boma

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:14.703
turned to a comments of a

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:18.440
question because I know we need

01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:19.040
to move on up. The others that

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:20.575
I guess. Question or comment I

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:22.611
was gonna say is that. As we're

01:21:22.677 --> 01:21:26.615
moving along. I just know how

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:28.183
organizations work in this

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.385
Friday also question of him for

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:31.019
the for are coming and give to

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:32.454
our non profits are presenting

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.556
next. Oftentimes is especially

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:35.190
with a deadline were barreling

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:36.258
along we need to get this done

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:36.825
we tend to go to our usual

01:21:36.891 --> 01:21:38.593
partners. Right there the

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.562
people are used to working with

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:41.029
the people we have a

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:42.564
relationship with and that's

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.499
great and we need to work with

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:48.270
them- but I also- asset we also

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:48.903
especially since we saw several

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:50.505
few months hueso Hundred Days

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.540
to think about the people we

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:54.743
don't normally partner with are

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.578
the people who we have and

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:57.078
there might be different

01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:58.380
reasons that might happen over

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:00.448
time or something- but- you

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:02.384
know. But they're also

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.984
representing groups of people

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:06.288
who then what happens may not

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:06.855
be as touched rate because

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:10.659
we're so. I just ask that we

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:14.262
reflect on the. If we just wait

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:14.896
for the people who were used to

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.464
coming and they come to the

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:17.032
table but we're not looking

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.366
like we're the empty seats are.

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:19.034
People having come to the table

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.635
so I think this is a good time

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:22.337
now the server reflected. Who

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:22.937
is it that's out there that's

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:24.606
not here. You might have had

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.641
even a bad experience with them

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:28.276
before this. You know let it

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:28.910
and say well. Do you need to

01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:30.679
rethink that especially for the

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.480
census so I'm just gonna throw

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:33.114
that out there. I'm sure you're

01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:34.649
doing all the out reach you

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:38.353
can- but I just want people to

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:38.987
think about that because those

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.388
are the places where gaps could

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:42.457
occur as well. And then it's

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:44.292
harder it takes more work

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.461
because these are people who

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:48.697
used. To you. You know all this

01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:49.331
I have an existing relationship

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:52.534
with. Thank you. I'm thank you

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.736
Senate pan. And we ought to put

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.738
a- pin in it so to speak. M.

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:57.238
went when miss Katagiri

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:58.673
testifies will later on. That's

01:22:58.740 --> 01:22:59.207
a great question about.

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:00.575
Coordination of resources you

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.277
know using the combined

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:04.379
language as a- an example there

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:05.046
other places and- in the states

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:06.614
and Hannah for example. That

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.616
has a large sum of my speakers

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.618
and so. We should be. Making

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:14.522
sure that we- have some

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:15.090
economies of scale here all

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:18.626
right. Before we turn to Senate

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.362
Gonzalez- and I know that the

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:22.497
every question that was asked.

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:24.399
Every member of the panel feels

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.468
an obligation to respond I

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:28.403
promise not to hold against you

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:29.070
if you don't need to respond to

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:30.572
every question- if you want to

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:32.440
contribute that's wonderful but

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:32.974
but you should not feel

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.809
compelled. To contribute on the

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.811
on each question and that will

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:38.813
apply to. Later panels as well.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.450
RT senators aus. Thank you this

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:43.084
is been a great discussion so

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:46.521
far so thank you all again- so

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:48.423
again I a thinker reiterate a

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.458
lot of- what my colleagues to

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:51.059
talk about in terms of this

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:54.429
year to three population- and I

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:55.029
didn't see and maybe I. Just

01:23:55.096 --> 01:23:56.765
skipped over this my head but

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.533
early education sites. Are we

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.769
thinking about a strategy to

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:01.202
tackle you know the

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:04.539
preschoolers. And also even I

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:06.474
was just at Saint Mary's- and

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:08.410
looking at the maternal sites

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.445
and- you know- Lumos classes or

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:11.012
is their strategy for that

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.714
because I think that's where

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:13.348
even if you're pregnant they're

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:14.783
still someone that's coming.

01:24:14.849 --> 01:24:18.553
Along that sometimes often is

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.120
not counted mothers are not

01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:22.457
thinking about counting them. I

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:24.559
can speak to that so I believe

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.661
it was. Maybe two weeks ago-

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:30.398
incarnation with. The LA county

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:31.032
office of education first five

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.667
we help her. Kind of first

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.536
convening of all the various

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:35.136
partners and I think those are

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:36.404
some of the strategies that

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:38.640
were- kind of. Included but

01:24:38.706 --> 01:24:40.408
were supposed to have a follow

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:41.009
up meeting in January second

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:42.477
take some of those comments and

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:43.077
feedback to make sure that we

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:44.712
include those populations but-

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:46.714
what we did for this initial

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:47.248
meeting was for all these

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:48.850
groups to kind of get in a room

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.485
and share what they're doing

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:51.052
whether it's in the spree

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.821
schools whether it's in schools

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.389
are like- so that we had that.

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.391
One conversation so I can take

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:58.626
that back to our next meeting

01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:00.528
which is scheduled for. January

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:02.797
no that our colleagues from on.

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:04.699
LA county office of education a

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:06.668
touch on that too but we will

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:07.268
take that back to make sure.

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:08.703
Great thank you and then the

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:10.705
only other question is- similar

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:11.239
to a doctor pan mentioned

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:12.907
about- people we don't often

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.876
think about collaborating with.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:17.011
But I would even look at how we

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:18.546
can leverage private support

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:19.147
you know some of our larger

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:20.748
corporations. Both on the

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:22.984
funding side because they often

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.419
have social responsibility.

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.454
Opportunities where they can

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:28.690
give to the census- initiatives

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:30.892
and be. For their employees

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:31.359
that could potentially

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:34.395
volunteered become ambassadors-

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.498
so I think just things to think

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:37.098
about unless there's something

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:38.500
you want to highlight if we're

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:40.702
already. Working with some

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:41.269
private industry think that

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:42.904
could be another opportunity.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.939
I'm at all just hi late as

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:46.741
something that we did- in

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.776
partnership with Wells Fargo we

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:50.778
trained their employees to be

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:51.412
senses goodwill ambassadors and

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:53.014
so- that's just one example of

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:58.586
how we are leveraging our-

01:25:58.653 --> 01:25:59.120
partnerships. With private

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:04.492
business. Yes on. The business

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:05.093
local businesses a sector in

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:06.594
our complete count committee

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:07.161
and we've engaged a chamber

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:07.695
with engage- our business

01:26:07.762 --> 01:26:08.663
improvement districts- but also

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.698
some local business businesses

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:14.502
as well- we have. A one example

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:16.671
of I like to share is frontier

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:18.706
communications. Is a city in

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:20.508
art- our complete count

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:22.510
committee and- they have-

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.846
offered up- an opportunity to

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.714
partner or one- trying to

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.516
access some equipment-

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.685
technology equipment. You know

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:31.352
it's so it may not meet all our

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.987
needs but we feel that that is

01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:34.622
very substantial- on a

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:36.858
substantial contribution that

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:38.893
they're planning to make an-

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.664
and so. I felt was important

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:43.131
highlight that one in

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:46.868
particular. So and that's kind

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:47.435
of part of our model and how

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:48.836
we're working and that's why we

01:26:48.903 --> 01:26:49.437
Gaines to businesses- to have

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:50.972
direct out reached with the

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:52.840
business but also to cultivate

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:54.609
opportunities for. Sharing

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:56.878
resources and so I want to lift

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:57.445
up that one example frontier

01:26:57.512 --> 01:27:00.815
communications. Thank you

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:03.017
Senate themselves alright let

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:04.786
let's just do a quick lightning

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:06.654
round here the questions I

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:07.255
asked earlier Wilk will just

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:08.990
start with Mr Rebay- what what

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:10.959
is Los Angeles county if

01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:12.961
anything contributed. Beyond

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:14.662
what state resource provided.

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:18.666
So some terms of resources- I

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:20.635
think when I started we had

01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:21.269
maybe three or four staff I'm

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:23.071
just fully assigned to census

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:24.973
meaning. They were not given

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:25.540
any other responsibility I

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:26.975
think since I'm about to about

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.843
maybe seven staff including our

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.612
J. S. of separate this point

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:32.614
it's been staff resources. I do

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.247
think as we start to conduct

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:34.882
some of this gap analysis on to

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:35.483
the end of this month and we

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.051
bring our cities online at the

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:39.020
maybe. We may be looking at

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.755
potentially non response follow

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:42.924
up as kind of a an an issue

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:43.591
that we may have to kind of the

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:44.993
board resources but I don't

01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:46.828
wanna it's not up to me but I

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:48.997
think just. In terms of kind of

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:50.798
what LA county has dedicated

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:51.432
terms of resources so is there

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:52.867
a specific. I'm actually

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.769
looking for specific dollar

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:55.336
amount is there's specific

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:57.038
dollar amount that the county

01:27:57.105 --> 01:28:00.742
of Los Angeles is designated-

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:02.644
potentially yes potentially

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:04.779
tensely yes any sense of when

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:05.413
that might happen before April

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.148
I hope. Yes before okay because

01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:08.616
I think I would like to come

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:10.818
back and provide that but I

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:14.789
think that the answer is yes. I

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:15.289
just don't have that the

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:15.823
dollar. All right city Los

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:19.093
Angeles. The city of Los

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.795
Angeles has contributed two

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:21.429
point one million dollars since

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:22.830
twenty seventeen. Thank you.

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:25.066
Long Beach. I know Mr Jackson

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.268
Yuri testified I think was five

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:27.869
and forty thousand dollars is

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:29.037
that right. Right all right

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:33.007
county of orange. I don't have

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:33.608
that figure but obviously can

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:35.276
get that to you but we do have

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:35.877
staff there obviously working

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:37.278
on this currently and also will

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.180
not be engaging our our staff

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:40.748
from different various

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:41.349
departments are twenty three

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.950
departments across the county.

01:28:43.017 --> 01:28:43.484
Okay Senate I think you've

01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:46.888
testified but go ahead. Yes so

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:48.923
this. City has allocated a

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.490
hundred twenty five thousand

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:51.125
dollars from our general fund.

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:52.894
In addition- our other

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.962
departments have put together

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:55.563
about fifty thousand dollars

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:57.131
towards this effort. And then

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:58.733
we've allocated about

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.935
700-007-5000 dollars so far and

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.037
staff time. So far the city has

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:05.039
put about two hundred fifty

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:06.808
thousand dollars towards the

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:07.442
suffer. Already thank you. Our

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:08.976
next question for the group

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:10.978
lightning round it metrics- if

01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:13.081
you can. Give me just one

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:15.183
example of a metric that you're

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:19.020
using- pre April. That would be

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.855
helpful and then then to the

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:21.489
extent that you actually have

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:23.091
metrics- and where you are in

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:25.193
those metrics if you could

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:27.195
submit them to us I would be

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:30.998
interested in that so. Starting

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:33.134
with county. Was sentenced so

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:33.768
one example because it's fresh

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:35.069
in my mind as to our media

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:35.737
contractor we actually do have

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:37.271
kind of metrics for kind of how

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:38.973
we're spending those dollars

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:39.607
whether it's like click through

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:41.008
rate social media kind of.

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:43.077
Facebook I think those are

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:45.046
things that we bill ten because

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:45.613
we know that we're going to

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.247
have to kind of demonstrate our

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:46.981
dollars and how they're they're

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:47.615
effective so that's probably

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.150
one example but I can also

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:49.751
share other metrics that were

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:51.252
incorporating. Within our city

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:53.287
contracts including here with

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:55.056
city violated a really great

01:29:55.123 --> 01:29:55.690
job of kind of Allen with their

01:29:55.757 --> 01:29:58.993
metrics as well as long beach.

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:02.964
City Los Angeles. Out through

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.598
our out reach direct outreach

01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:04.198
efforts were actually already

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.299
uploading information onto the

01:30:05.366 --> 01:30:06.934
sword system that documents

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:08.936
number of impressions that we

01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:11.139
are having out of all of our

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:14.942
outreach events- and- I already

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:15.443
mentioned the goal of

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.111
recruiting census goodwill

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:19.180
ambassadors we've exceeded that

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.282
and- I we will also be

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:23.151
collecting metrics from the C.

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:24.952
D. A.'s each one of them that

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:27.355
we train I will be expected to

01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:29.357
collect twenty five played to

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:31.092
pledge to be counted- the and

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:33.361
cheats from the people that

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:36.964
they engage. And for the many

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:39.300
grants that we give that to you

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:41.135
organizations there- the goal

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:47.041
is to obtain fifty so I'm just

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:48.976
to the panels so what am I in a

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:49.577
they may have been articulate

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:51.112
when I say metrics actually

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:51.746
mean performance measures so we

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:55.249
set you know for example a goal

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:55.817
of four hundred and we have

01:30:55.883 --> 01:30:59.220
achieved. X. towards so long

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:03.324
which. So we work with our

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:05.226
member of yeah organizations-

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:07.395
to identify activities- to

01:31:07.461 --> 01:31:09.230
contribute to the towards

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:09.831
outreach effort- and they set

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:11.465
goals- in so we're gonna be

01:31:11.532 --> 01:31:13.067
tracking those activities in

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:13.701
sort- to determine you know to

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:15.403
have an example of any of those

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:19.140
those goals and- where you

01:31:19.207 --> 01:31:19.740
might be in relation to those

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:23.544
goals. We've we've just I. we

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:23.945
just completed the

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.012
identification for

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:25.580
implementation plan of those

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:27.248
activities and so- and we

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:27.882
created the tracking mechanism

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:29.417
now for sort. And so we haven't

01:31:29.483 --> 01:31:31.519
begun putting that information

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:33.421
in the sort- we do have a goal

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:35.356
a couple things I can highlight

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:37.458
you know we have a goal to

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:38.092
recruit five hundred senses and

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:41.062
passengers- we know we're

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:41.662
starting with as a starting

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:43.464
point we're gonna be working

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:45.399
with our seven hundred fifty

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:47.201
neighbor leadership all. Alumni

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:49.136
we think we- will make us not

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:49.737
get halfway there so we we've

01:31:49.804 --> 01:31:53.074
already begun working on that-

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:53.641
we can we reach out to our

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:54.208
board to commission so that

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:55.209
that's that's perfect that's

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:55.843
what I'm looking for is we have

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:59.380
a goal of. X. in we are keeping

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:01.349
track to see how close were

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:03.284
coming to that goal in our

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:03.885
progress yes. Alright I could

01:32:03.951 --> 01:32:05.486
point out one other thing we

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:07.321
know that we have this the

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:09.357
bureau has a goal of hiring

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:11.158
four thousand- enumerators your

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:13.060
long beach. On the currently-

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:13.661
as we understand it we're at

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:15.429
about two thousand- and so we

01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:17.531
have a delta there and so we

01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:19.433
are using- our workforce

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:23.170
development agency and apart

01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:23.704
all right right thank you

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:24.305
perfect okay. Connie Warren

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:25.539
should. We are currently are

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:27.174
working on the establishing

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:29.410
these goals and these metrics

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:29.911
in relation to a because

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:31.379
obviously the state would like

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:31.979
are why no one where that we

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.614
need to put resources as you

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:35.182
can imagine the communications

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:37.418
component. That'll be even more

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:37.985
easily trackable as far as

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:41.289
impressions of concern there's

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:41.822
no there's no performance

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:43.524
measures not this not the

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:45.459
present time rhetoric and

01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:47.228
you're going to you're going to

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:51.632
help. Us out and absolutely all

01:32:51.699 --> 01:32:55.303
right thank you Susanna. So one

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:57.338
of our goals is to- interact

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:57.838
with approximately three

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:59.507
hundred. Thousand residents

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:00.141
over the period of time. So far

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:01.509
we've- counted about sixty

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:02.109
thousand direct impressions.

01:33:02.176 --> 01:33:03.177
And then we're also counting

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:03.778
how many sign ups we receive

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:04.312
from residents to actually

01:33:04.378 --> 01:33:05.313
receive ongoing updates on the

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:07.448
census. So far we have over a

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:08.049
thousand emails and phone was

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:11.185
goal. Goal we don't have a

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:13.554
number set for that one we just

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:14.188
are trying to get as many as we

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:17.558
possibly can. Last lightning

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.560
round question- I I'll- I'm

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:21.262
sure you all need more

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:21.829
resources will will assume

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:23.597
that- but separate apart from

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:24.131
money what's your biggest

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:27.668
challenge. Besides time because

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:29.337
we don't get an extension for

01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:29.904
the science right so well

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:33.274
except that I'm for LA county

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.509
at least I'm now that we have

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:37.545
the guidelines for Q. a season

01:33:37.611 --> 01:33:39.513
sake he at. Our senses action

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:40.147
cast in the question arcs and

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:41.349
centers it'll be kind of

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:41.983
rolling that out to make sure

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.284
that the locations we

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:43.751
identified meet those

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:45.586
requirements so that is going

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:47.455
to be a significant challenge

01:33:47.521 --> 01:33:48.055
so in light with the C. bill

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:49.523
they were going to be doing a

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:50.157
reading this assessment of our

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:51.492
county locations but for us-

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:53.561
that will be our Christmas. And

01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:55.563
new year project can make sure

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:57.398
that our locations kind of meat

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.367
that the requirements. Thank

01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:00.001
you said it was angel's direct

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:01.268
out reach to residents

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:05.306
experiencing homelessness given.

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:05.906
The size and complexity of our

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:11.612
population. Long Beach. Outside

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.581
of resources I would say

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:14.215
additional support- so much LA

01:34:14.281 --> 01:34:14.749
reaching out to our homes

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:19.320
population. Well when Connie.

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:21.655
The challenge is obviously just

01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:22.256
the number of the volume of

01:34:22.323 --> 01:34:23.758
folks that we actually have to

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:25.726
touch within a relatively short

01:34:25.793 --> 01:34:27.795
time period so probably the any

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:28.262
specific Orange County

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:31.599
challenged. None that I can

01:34:31.665 --> 01:34:32.099
think of right original

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.401
Santana. One of our challenges

01:34:33.467 --> 01:34:35.569
is to ensure that all of our

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.371
households within one address

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:39.540
are counted we have a lot of.

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:41.609
Other folks living and I AT use

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:43.978
or additional units within that

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:45.780
property and just combating not

01:34:45.846 --> 01:34:49.583
just because- one of the

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:51.619
households in the- and not. For

01:34:51.685 --> 01:34:53.687
the address was counted does

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:54.288
not mean that everyone in the

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:55.523
household with cabinet alright

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:57.391
folks that don't necessarily

01:34:57.458 --> 01:34:58.025
feel that they're part of this

01:34:58.092 --> 01:34:59.760
household. We just need to make

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:01.629
remind them that. They should

01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:03.397
be conscious teller some of our

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:04.031
colleagues are trying to create

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:05.499
more eighties matter fact. So a

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:06.067
couple questions county of

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:11.872
orange- the- city of Santa said

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:13.574
that they're the hardest to

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:15.476
count. The city is that right

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:16.043
is that your estimation as

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:17.645
well. Yes the city's a Santana

01:35:17.711 --> 01:35:19.713
as well as Anaheim would be the

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:20.314
two hardest mathcounts cities

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:21.482
in the in the county of orange.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.551
All right in in terms of

01:35:23.617 --> 01:35:25.619
coordination with the county

01:35:25.686 --> 01:35:27.488
Orange County part of education

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:28.055
are you cordoning with the

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:29.824
orange Gaines particle of

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:30.424
education yes we are at this

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:33.494
time. Okay and maybe offline-

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:34.095
will last some more questions

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:35.563
about how that coordination is

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:37.598
going and what their plans are

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.500
as well. So all right- thank

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:40.101

right now is a in our sense a

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:43.824
great spot and a lot of it is

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:45.826
because of what. You heard from

and our various key cities it's

01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:50.130
because of the trust and early

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:52.099
coordination that we've built

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:54.101
with the county city about laci

01:37:54.168 --> 01:37:56.103
of Long Beach and other cities

partners have had an

01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:05.879
opportunity to really free Lee

01:38:05.946 --> 01:38:08.048
and deeply focus on what is our

01:38:08.115 --> 01:38:10.084
community need to be sure we

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:11.819
have folks who can reach folks

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:13.821
out the door. To make sure that

01:38:13.887 --> 01:38:14.388
we've identified brick and

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:16.090
mortars where the county can

01:38:16.156 --> 01:38:18.125
partner- with folks to be

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:20.160

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:24.298
that simultaneously the county

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:26.200
was working on mobilizing every

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:28.235
resource it had as well as the

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:31.839
city the city's contribution

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:32.373
into the port fun for Los

01:38:32.439 --> 01:38:35.809
Angeles was a tremendous

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:36.410
catalyst in addition to the

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:38.178
states of funding to also bring

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:43.884
philanthropy to the table. So

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:44.418
what I will share with you

01:38:44.485 --> 01:38:48.088

01:38:48.155 --> 01:38:51.925
investment. From your

legislative Bob- the support of

01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:53.193
the governor's office and the

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.328
everyday support of the of the

01:38:54.395 --> 01:38:56.196
complete count office brought

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:57.931
significant resources to Ali

01:38:57.998 --> 01:38:58.532
eight point four million but

01:38:58.599 --> 01:39:00.267
what really has happened since

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:02.469
then is whether public sector

01:39:02.536 --> 01:39:03.937
partners and community

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:06.040
partners. Really working with

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:06.674
philanthropy to have them step

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:09.910
up and I'm happy to report that

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:11.912
in addition to the eight point

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:12.513
four million investment from

01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:13.914
the state we've actually

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.983
augmented dot to upwards of

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:17.918
over seventeen million dollars

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:19.920
that all have been concentrated

01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:22.222
on get out the count efforts-

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:24.091
in various communities and hard

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:26.160
to count tracks in LA county.

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:28.262
The way that we've worked early

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:30.097
and planning has been in

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:32.099
collaboration with key

01:39:32.166 --> 01:39:34.034
organizations that have been

01:39:34.101 --> 01:39:34.601
transformative to LA on any

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:36.403
issue from healthcare to

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:40.307
education to civic

01:39:40.374 --> 01:39:40.941
participation and what you see

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:42.609
up on the slide is what we call

01:39:42.676 --> 01:39:44.445
the core of the steering

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:46.146
committee so everything that

01:39:46.213 --> 01:39:48.182
you hear about today has been

01:39:48.248 --> 01:39:50.084
built in collaboration and

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:52.219
partnership. With these

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:54.221
organizations and as with these

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:56.423
organizations have been able to

01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:57.091
then work and interact with the

01:39:57.157 --> 01:39:58.459
county as they've developed and

01:39:58.525 --> 01:40:00.494
the city as they've developed

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:02.029
the complete count committees

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:04.231
all these organizations play

01:40:04.298 --> 01:40:06.266
lead roles in their regions it

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:08.135
helping to support other local

01:40:08.202 --> 01:40:08.669
complete come committees

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:10.471
proclaim abuse for out in in

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:12.306
the valley has helped San

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:14.208
Fernando build a complete

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:14.842
commit. To these the really the

01:40:14.908 --> 01:40:16.143
organizations that have built

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:18.212
it the question of metrics has

01:40:18.278 --> 01:40:20.280
been brought up you see USC

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:22.249
Dorrance F. and engage our Andy

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:22.649
have been working

01:40:22.716 --> 01:40:24.251
collaboratively with

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:26.286
organizations across the county

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:28.255
to understand how are you

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:30.290
measuring success we need a big

01:40:30.357 --> 01:40:32.159
sure that success it is a

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:34.128
percentage Bates a person

01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:34.762
counted and so they're working

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:36.430
collectively with us with the

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:38.365
sporty in this eight to make

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:38.999
sure that we have metrics as we

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:40.200
start moving forward but

01:40:40.267 --> 01:40:42.269
metrics that are real- and so

01:40:42.336 --> 01:40:44.505
we're- excited to have those

01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:48.208
partnerships as well. I'm. A

01:40:48.275 --> 01:40:50.444
lot of the work that we've been

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:51.044
doing early on. We received

01:40:51.111 --> 01:40:51.645
resources from the state in

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:52.579
here I will underscore. That

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:54.348
having had resources early. Has

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:58.152
made a big difference in and

01:40:58.218 --> 01:40:58.752
you'll see this in the next

01:40:58.819 --> 01:41:00.387
couple of slides the first is

01:41:00.454 --> 01:41:02.256
we work collaboratively with

01:41:02.322 --> 01:41:02.823
our community partners and

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:04.358
steering committee to identify

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:06.260
what are the capacities that

01:41:06.326 --> 01:41:08.262
organizations say they need to

01:41:08.328 --> 01:41:10.130
build in order to be. Effective

01:41:10.197 --> 01:41:12.232
messengers on the census so we

01:41:12.299 --> 01:41:14.234
identified messaging media

01:41:14.301 --> 01:41:16.136
tearing digital training that's

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:16.770
key things organizations needed

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:20.274
beyond just bodies. And to date

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.476
we launched with our partners

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:24.344
at Fenton aid. Tool kit online

01:41:24.411 --> 01:41:26.146
tool kit that organizations

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:26.780
where organizations can access

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:28.515
these resources get access to

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:32.152
trainings we've had over a

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:32.786
thousand folks axis these tool

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:36.156
kit so far- eight hundred and

01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:36.723
thirty three different users

01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:40.260
and- just even more downloads

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:40.894
than that and you'll see some

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:42.463
of that. As our partners have

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:42.963
deployed those different

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:46.400
assets. I'm communications

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:48.135
training was something critical

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:50.304
we're gonna need. A lot of

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:50.904
different trusted messengers

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:54.308
and in order their trusted- but

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:54.908
in order for them to have an

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:56.343
impact they need to be

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.612
effective as well. And so to

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:02.149
date we've- collaborated to put

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:04.151
together for different.

01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:04.785
Communications trainings across

01:42:04.852 --> 01:42:08.288
the county where we've had a

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:08.789
hundred and thirty two

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:09.289
different organizations

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:12.392
participate. Again this is done

01:42:12.459 --> 01:42:12.926
in coordination with our

01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:14.228
partners at the state. The

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:18.332
county and the city as well. Is

01:42:18.398 --> 01:42:20.534
just an image of different

01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:21.134
community partners- building

01:42:21.201 --> 01:42:22.503
their capacity talking about

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:24.538
there was a lot of conversation

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:26.273
early on about message testing

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:26.907
and what are we learning from

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:28.675
focus groups. This is an image

01:42:28.742 --> 01:42:30.611
of all of that testing being

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:32.513
put to use in our trusted

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:34.314
messengers and working and

01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:36.483
preparing for how to not just

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:37.084
talk to the community but to

01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:38.585
media. To make sure every

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:40.454
opportunity we get we get the

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:42.456
right message. I'm we shared

01:42:42.523 --> 01:42:46.426
with with the committee a quick

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:48.495
snapshot M. report of the scale

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:50.264
of resources that have been

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.266
deployed so here in LA county

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:54.368
as of last week. We've been

01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:56.270
able to provide grant funding

01:42:56.336 --> 01:42:56.737
for get out the count

01:42:56.803 --> 01:42:58.505
activities to a hundred

01:42:58.572 --> 01:43:00.407
organizations across the county

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:02.376
totaling. Twelve point seven

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:04.278
million dollars in investments-

01:43:04.344 --> 01:43:04.811
with a mix of both public

01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:06.680
dollars in private dollars this

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.582
covers a range of tactics

01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:12.252
everything from door to door.

01:43:12.319 --> 01:43:12.753
To train the trainer to

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:14.555
implementing more effective-

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:16.590
digital media out reach an

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:20.260
obviously as well- preparing

01:43:20.327 --> 01:43:20.827
for becoming a questionnaire

01:43:20.894 --> 01:43:24.364
assistance center and other

01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:24.932
ways to help and be part. Of

01:43:24.998 --> 01:43:28.535
the effort. I'm I won't go into

01:43:28.602 --> 01:43:29.036
these pieces but in the

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:30.437
materials we provided and happy

01:43:30.504 --> 01:43:32.272
to answer questions about what

01:43:32.339 --> 01:43:32.873
communities have been covered

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.675
what populations have been

01:43:34.741 --> 01:43:36.643
covered. I we've been able to

01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:38.278
document and share that in

01:43:38.345 --> 01:43:38.812
center pan to your earlier

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:40.480
question about. Our region

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:42.449
language there's what will be

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:44.284
able to print and we're working

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:44.818
all across the different

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:46.620
partners. To do as much as we

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:48.755
can but as far as organizations

01:43:48.822 --> 01:43:50.591
on the ground we recorded about

01:43:50.657 --> 01:43:52.259
thirty seven different

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:54.561
languages covered through the

01:43:54.628 --> 01:43:56.330
various partner so far in the

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:56.964
grant making and so that gives

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:58.532
us extensively more reach. Out

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:00.534
to what we're doing and we've

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.269
provided for transparency

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:02.736
purposes were all the

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:04.705
organizations so far that have

01:44:04.771 --> 01:44:06.540
been funded so. Once again

partnership with the state

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:14.514
census office but more

01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:14.982

01:44:15.048 --> 01:44:16.383
leadership at the county and

01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:18.518
the and the cities that allowed

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:19.086

01:44:19.152 --> 01:44:20.721
partnership. Thank you mistress

01:44:20.787 --> 01:44:26.727

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:30.631
forward Mr Suazo. It's going to

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:32.666

01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:36.536
morning good afternoon whatever

01:44:36.603 --> 01:44:38.472
time it is- legislatures spent

01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:40.607
this time there is never any

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:41.241
never enough time in the census

01:44:41.308 --> 01:44:42.843
my name is James was on the

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:44.678
associate director at Long

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:46.747
Beach forward on the first off

01:44:46.813 --> 01:44:48.582
I have to say hi mom because

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:49.216
she's watching the live stream

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:52.653
right now so- I am excited to

01:44:52.719 --> 01:44:53.286
share a little bit about what

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:56.456
Long Beach for it is working on

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:56.923
as one of the regional

01:44:56.990 --> 01:45:00.394
coconveners with Ellie regional

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.396
census table. And we can unless

01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:04.598
it was K. and so on a little

01:45:04.665 --> 01:45:05.198
bit about going off of what-

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:06.867
the faint talked about in terms

01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:07.467
of our we were organizing in

01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:08.635
thinking about scale because

01:45:08.702 --> 01:45:09.269
when we think about the census

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:10.804
and what it takes to get a

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:12.539
complete count it's a question

01:45:12.606 --> 01:45:14.641
of scale right on so for us in

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:16.877
our approach with LA county in

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.779
on one of the largest and

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:20.781
hardest account in the country

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:24.384
we know we have a- large task.

01:45:24.451 --> 01:45:26.586
Ahead of us and our approach to

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:28.755
that first I'm actually off all

01:45:28.822 --> 01:45:30.557
the nineteen with the LA

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:32.592
regional census table which

01:45:32.659 --> 01:45:34.895
was- research we restructure

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:40.567
the beginning of the year. To

01:45:40.634 --> 01:45:41.201
tell coconveners including Long

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:48.475
Beach. Which are the events

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:49.076
from project California hello

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:50.610
boys became a beautiful. On the

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:51.178
cell a collaborative Cynthia

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:52.479
we'll talk a little bit about

01:45:52.546 --> 01:45:53.146
their work- Anil deli partners

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:54.815
for health- to really organize

01:45:54.881 --> 01:45:55.415
and bring together community

01:45:55.482 --> 01:45:56.650
based organizations- to learn

01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:57.217
about the census help get

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:58.618
prepared. And really it's a

01:45:58.685 --> 01:45:59.186
recognition that CBO's are

01:45:59.252 --> 01:45:59.820
trusted messengers within the

01:45:59.886 --> 01:46:00.721
community and to focus and

01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:01.388
prioritize. Our efforts on hard

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:02.889
to count communities- our role

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:04.891
is not only just to reach out

01:46:04.958 --> 01:46:05.492
to her to come communities but

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:06.827
more importantly what often

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:07.461
doesn't get looked up. Is to

01:46:07.527 --> 01:46:08.595
validate all of the messages

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:09.196
that are already being put out

01:46:09.262 --> 01:46:10.664
there by different levels of

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:11.198
government. By our local

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:14.501
municipalities- and to ensure

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:16.503
that that people understand-

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:18.505
about the safety and security

01:46:18.572 --> 01:46:19.106
of the census. So one of the

01:46:19.172 --> 01:46:20.907
efforts that have come out of

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:22.676
that collaboration and resource

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:23.243
sharing. Has been the week

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:24.911
count campaign which you've

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:28.482
seen- that lesson just logo I

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:30.484
introduce you now to the- I

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:31.118
think cooler Long Beach version

01:46:31.184 --> 01:46:32.719
of the logo- I'm a little

01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:34.788
biased. And but just to give

01:46:34.855 --> 01:46:35.388
you an idea of what the scale

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:38.692
looks like right when we're

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:39.226
talking about a regional

01:46:39.292 --> 01:46:39.860
approach. We're also oh my gosh

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:40.727
when. Okay we're also talking

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:42.662
about a regional approach- in

01:46:42.729 --> 01:46:44.798
the sub regions right. Where we

01:46:44.865 --> 01:46:46.800
have organizations within Long

01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:48.635
Beach coming together and all

01:46:48.702 --> 01:46:49.035
of these different

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:50.804
organizations- that you can see

01:46:50.871 --> 01:46:52.806
listed on. Working on various

01:46:52.873 --> 01:46:55.075
levels of census education and

01:46:55.142 --> 01:46:56.610
not reached hardy count

01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:57.144
entities. And what that

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:58.879
actually look has looked like

01:46:58.945 --> 01:47:01.047
on. Has been different- as

01:47:01.114 --> 01:47:03.016
we've been go as been rolling

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:06.686
out of. Coming month and I will

01:47:06.753 --> 01:47:08.655
say for us our team- back in

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:09.189
our- in our community the

01:47:09.256 --> 01:47:10.690
census is already here right

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:12.692
there's no it's coming it's

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:13.293
already here for us. The what

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:14.661
that's look. It's been

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:15.162
connection and bringing

01:47:15.228 --> 01:47:16.663
organizations together. Has

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:17.130
allowed us to do more

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:18.765
relationship building not just

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:20.667
within organizations. And

01:47:20.734 --> 01:47:23.003
within our ecosystem but also

01:47:23.069 --> 01:47:24.905
across sectors. So been able to

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:26.706
leverage relationships with

01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:28.675
anchor institutions such as

01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:29.276
state Long Beach. Even working

01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:31.077
with the city as well- but also

01:47:31.144 --> 01:47:32.946
availability asset building and

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:40.620
how we can- bring in community.

01:47:40.687 --> 01:47:41.154
To read account community

01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:46.693
actually off thank you. The

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:47.327
that's something that we didn't

01:47:47.394 --> 01:47:47.928
one of our early meetings we

01:47:47.994 --> 01:47:48.662
had organizations come in

01:47:48.728 --> 01:47:49.162
whether they were large

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:49.796
nonprofits or small grassroots

01:47:49.863 --> 01:47:50.730
neighborhood groups saying.

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:51.331
Ever going to reach out to the

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:51.898
senior population for gonna

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:52.799
reach us the black population

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:53.333
we need people from those

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.734
communities to do that. And as

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:55.302
you all probably know that

01:47:55.368 --> 01:47:55.836
requires a hefty amount of

01:47:55.902 --> 01:47:56.469
resources to really support and

01:47:56.536 --> 01:47:57.070
do that properly- and for us

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:58.605
it's really about doing

01:47:58.672 --> 01:47:59.172
hitting. The ground running

01:47:59.239 --> 01:47:59.706
with direct out reach so

01:47:59.773 --> 01:48:00.774
whether that's a door knocking

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:02.609
phone banking. And actually

01:48:02.676 --> 01:48:03.243
doing that to scale where we

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:04.845
can prioritize areas such in

01:48:04.911 --> 01:48:06.847
Long Beach. Like a central west

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:07.447
in north Long Beach where you

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:08.949
have these concentrations. Of

01:48:09.015 --> 01:48:10.884
hard account communities and

01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:12.686
just the lastly underscore- but

01:48:12.752 --> 01:48:14.888
if I. N. mentioned. All of

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:15.488
these efforts and everything

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:16.990
that you see in these photos of

01:48:17.057 --> 01:48:17.657
folks coming together in doing

01:48:17.724 --> 01:48:18.959
this work. Is long term

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:20.894
capacity building and I want to

01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:22.896
emphasize that. This investment

01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:23.296
in community based

01:48:23.363 --> 01:48:24.898
organizations to do this work

01:48:24.965 --> 01:48:25.532
is a long term investment and

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:26.967
the health of the communities.

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:28.735
Where so many other social

01:48:28.802 --> 01:48:29.202
programs and economic

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:30.904
strategies that you all are

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:32.772
looking at is directly impacted

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:34.641
by this. So we're building a

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:36.710
long term strategy to really

01:48:36.776 --> 01:48:37.377
engage people directly from the

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:39.179
community. And at the same time

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:40.881
engage people on the importance

01:48:40.947 --> 01:48:42.816
of the census. Thank you. Thank

01:48:42.883 --> 01:48:44.818
you Mr Swasawke. I thank you

01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:46.686
also for making sure that the

01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:47.287
streaming is most valuable so

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:48.922
we know we have at least one

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:51.157
viewer. We appreciate that mom

01:48:51.224 --> 01:48:53.193
for. Tuning in that'll help our

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:57.030
metrics so. All right. Thank

01:48:57.097 --> 01:49:02.936
you. This Cortez. Greetings

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:03.570
everybody- my name is Cindy and

01:49:03.637 --> 01:49:04.971
I'm very happy to be here to

01:49:05.038 --> 01:49:05.538
talk a little bit about the

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:06.806
work the seller collaborative

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:08.708
is doing in the southeast LA-

01:49:08.775 --> 01:49:09.342
to share a little bit about the

01:49:09.409 --> 01:49:10.844
collaborative we are network of

01:49:10.911 --> 01:49:12.712
nonprofit organizations gather

01:49:12.779 --> 01:49:13.313
to lead southeast Los Angeles

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:15.181
county. Into era vitality by

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:16.917
strengthening the seller

01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:17.384
communities. Building

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:18.919
collective power. And

01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:20.720
encouraging regional systemic

01:49:20.787 --> 01:49:23.023
change. Now one of the first

01:49:23.089 --> 01:49:26.726
things I want to. Talk about.

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:28.728
Is what did our twenty ten.

01:49:28.795 --> 01:49:29.329
Census response your profile

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:31.131
look like. And this map- really

01:49:31.197 --> 01:49:33.033
highlights the fact that our

01:49:33.099 --> 01:49:34.935
region is considered very high

01:49:35.001 --> 01:49:37.203
are. Has a very high or high

01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:39.039
low response gore. And we also

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:40.941
know that this indicators

01:49:41.007 --> 01:49:42.742
derived by the twelve variables

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:43.376
that inform the hard to count

01:49:43.443 --> 01:49:45.145
index. So when we start talking

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:46.947
about what is it going to take

01:49:47.013 --> 01:49:48.882
to actively reach. The nooks

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:50.717
and crannies of the not only

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:51.251
the different cities. But

01:49:51.318 --> 01:49:52.886
unincorporated areas or

01:49:52.953 --> 01:49:54.788
different spaces that are not

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:55.388
necessarily easy to reach by

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.090
virtue of our maybe street

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:59.059
infrastructure system. We have

01:49:59.125 --> 01:50:00.927
learned that by being able

01:50:00.994 --> 01:50:01.561
start these conversations early

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:03.263
on. Our region has a lot of

01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:05.265
unique stake holders. That are

01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:07.033
all committed for census

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.135
engagement out reach but at

01:50:09.202 --> 01:50:11.037
various degrees. So looking up

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:12.906
this mat we know I want to

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:14.908
highlight limited English

01:50:14.975 --> 01:50:15.442
proficiency. Foreign born

01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:17.177
certified and being a renter or

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:19.079
living in a multi family units

01:50:19.145 --> 01:50:21.181
address. Are going to be the

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:23.016
big variables that are

01:50:23.083 --> 01:50:23.650
impacting the score. What we

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:25.285
also know that because it's

01:50:25.352 --> 01:50:27.153
highly read. All of the twelve

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.089
are very active in this region

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:31.024
which- means we have to be very

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:31.624
proactive and how we're gonna

01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:33.126
tackle this. To talk a little

01:50:33.193 --> 01:50:35.195
bit about our Ellie are C. T.

01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:36.863
space. We do convene a

01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:38.999
significant amount of nonprofit

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:40.900
organizations C. Beals. In

01:50:40.967 --> 01:50:42.902
southeast LA. But because of

01:50:42.969 --> 01:50:43.403
the nature of our city

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:44.938
boundaries the nature of where

01:50:45.005 --> 01:50:46.840
our non profits are located.

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:47.474
And just because we're really

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:50.844
trying to convince the region

01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:51.411
we also have the deferments

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:54.848
apologies. Folks such as gait

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:55.415
Kommersant or what these are

01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:57.250
different folks that joined the

01:50:57.317 --> 01:50:59.019
space to talk about their own

01:50:59.085 --> 01:51:03.223
sense of. Outreach activities

01:51:03.289 --> 01:51:03.790
in a into the work the C. B.

01:51:03.857 --> 01:51:08.962
older. Doing that include train

01:51:09.029 --> 01:51:09.562
the trainer models from but I

01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:11.097
training campaigns- youth

01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:13.199
ambassador work on mobile. Ask

01:51:13.266 --> 01:51:13.833
unit. So what we're what we're

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.001
coming to this table and

01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:15.602
everybody gets the opportunity

01:51:15.668 --> 01:51:17.103
to report out in the regional

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:17.670
discussion component. That

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:18.304
means are also able to usher in

01:51:18.371 --> 01:51:19.039
a conversation on the gap

01:51:19.105 --> 01:51:20.840
analysis. So while we know what

01:51:20.907 --> 01:51:21.408
I may be doing for hard to

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:22.008
count and my are restrictive

01:51:22.075 --> 01:51:23.143
and what geographic area I want

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:24.844
to reach. When you're listening

01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:27.180
to this fire thirty to forty to

01:51:27.247 --> 01:51:27.814
fifty different voices we can

01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:29.215
still build a common

01:51:29.282 --> 01:51:30.917
understanding of what are the

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:31.451
additional efforts or the

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:33.286
partners we need to engage

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:34.921
with. To make sure that as you

01:51:34.988 --> 01:51:37.090
move towards March we are not

01:51:37.157 --> 01:51:37.757
only well prepared with census

01:51:37.824 --> 01:51:39.292
knowledge but we're well

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:39.793
informed on a regional

01:51:39.859 --> 01:51:42.862
strategy. So a lot of the work

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:43.496
that we're doing is holding the

01:51:43.563 --> 01:51:44.931
space so that we understand the

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:47.067
roles. Of not only the C. deals

01:51:47.133 --> 01:51:48.968
are meant to support partners.

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:49.602
And different key players that

01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:51.004
I want to highlight to you.

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:53.139
Which include- how do we

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:55.075
continue to engage our non CEO

01:51:55.141 --> 01:51:55.642
community star grassroots

01:51:55.708 --> 01:51:57.177
organizations and volunteer

01:51:57.243 --> 01:51:58.945
groups. That are highly

01:51:59.012 --> 01:52:01.014
motivated because at the end of

01:52:01.081 --> 01:52:01.548
the day they do know that

01:52:01.614 --> 01:52:02.949
these- these funding resources

01:52:03.016 --> 01:52:03.550
impact their daily lives. But

01:52:03.616 --> 01:52:05.285
how do we get them the

01:52:05.351 --> 01:52:07.220
resources. In a timely manner

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:08.955
and in a very accessible way.

01:52:09.022 --> 01:52:09.589
We also recognize that for the

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:11.257
southeast region our faith

01:52:11.324 --> 01:52:13.393
based organizations are another

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.295
additional trusted messenger.

01:52:15.361 --> 01:52:17.030
We know that our schools are

01:52:17.097 --> 01:52:19.199
trusted messenger so what does

01:52:19.265 --> 01:52:19.833
it mean to make sure that they

01:52:19.899 --> 01:52:21.101
are also in a timely manner.

01:52:21.167 --> 01:52:21.601
Having the conversations

01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:23.369
building that awareness to feel

01:52:23.436 --> 01:52:25.405
very comfortable when perhaps

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:27.207
on delivering a sermon. Or

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:27.774
whatever out reach strategy

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:29.342
they elect into. The last

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:31.244
piece- because of the

01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:33.079
coordinating component worth

01:52:33.146 --> 01:52:35.115
trying to figure out are we

01:52:35.181 --> 01:52:37.250
collaborate in a record eight

01:52:37.317 --> 01:52:38.985
are cross promoting.

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:41.254
Understanding which later of

01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:43.323
pollution our blossoming in do.

01:52:43.389 --> 01:52:44.958
How do we as a collaborative

01:52:45.024 --> 01:52:45.525
hold that space. To connect

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:47.127
people with the right agencies

01:52:47.193 --> 01:52:47.727
are the right place are they

01:52:47.794 --> 01:52:49.162
have a question. About cats

01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:51.197
were connected them with the

01:52:51.264 --> 01:52:53.199
city of a late work. Away or if

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:53.833
their partner that's active in

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.268
Long Beach making sure that

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:56.970
they are connected with chains

01:52:57.036 --> 01:52:59.072
are partners in- San Fran Alex

01:52:59.139 --> 01:53:03.243
on and so. Forth that's a

01:53:03.309 --> 01:53:03.843
little bit about what I wanted

01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:09.115
to share with you all to. Thank

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:11.284
you Cortez. I'm let's and the

01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:11.851
comments and questions with

01:53:11.918 --> 01:53:13.353
Senate pan. Thank you thank you

01:53:13.419 --> 01:53:15.388
so much your presentations on

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.090
the work you're doing and I

01:53:17.157 --> 01:53:17.690
appreciate the fact that does

01:53:17.757 --> 01:53:19.359
recognize that the census at

01:53:19.425 --> 01:53:21.427
work. Really is going on right

01:53:21.494 --> 01:53:23.363
now right I mean we start

01:53:23.429 --> 01:53:23.997
counting in April but the- the

01:53:24.063 --> 01:53:25.431
US is saying the social norms

01:53:25.498 --> 01:53:27.066
and building those

01:53:27.133 --> 01:53:27.700
relationships that well Bob for

01:53:27.767 --> 01:53:29.135
us in case people you know

01:53:29.202 --> 01:53:29.702
others counter messages may

01:53:29.769 --> 01:53:31.371
happen later on and so forth.

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:34.974
In and I appreciate that- that

01:53:35.041 --> 01:53:35.508
actually that this contest

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:39.212
touched on this a. When we look

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:42.982
at the census. You know.

01:53:43.049 --> 01:53:43.449
Everything's divide by

01:53:43.516 --> 01:53:45.118
geography with census tracks

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:45.718
isn't it you know we- cities

01:53:45.785 --> 01:53:46.986
and counties the odd boundaries

01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:49.155
and so forth. But for some

01:53:49.222 --> 01:53:51.057
communities right I mean- the

01:53:51.124 --> 01:53:53.459
community isn't. A geographic

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:55.428
what it's not the idiom maybe

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:57.530
there's they may be in certain

01:53:57.597 --> 01:53:59.432
areas more than others but

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:01.301
they're surrounds spread out

01:54:01.367 --> 01:54:03.169
and I. Without actually

01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:03.770
interest of the sets of data

01:54:03.836 --> 01:54:05.538
will help us understand that

01:54:05.605 --> 01:54:09.108
right so. The ability of GTP

01:54:09.175 --> 01:54:09.642
community right Tom. API

01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:11.411
committees are de maybe some

01:54:11.477 --> 01:54:11.978
places they concentrate but

01:54:12.045 --> 01:54:13.179
they're also spread out. So

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:13.813
when we're trying to figure out

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:19.352
how to message. Right in of so

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:19.886
I actually heard this from

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:23.189
somebody who said well. What

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:25.291
was with the senses budget very

01:54:25.358 --> 01:54:27.193
geographic based right. And

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.095
that that's not really working

01:54:29.162 --> 01:54:29.696
for my community because we're

01:54:29.762 --> 01:54:30.363
not all one's face were kind of

01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:31.431
scattered around so what are

01:54:31.497 --> 01:54:32.065
you doing to be sure as were

01:54:32.131 --> 01:54:35.101
touching communities and we are

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:35.568
you know I mean census

01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:37.170
enumerators people point to

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:39.105
geographies but- that were-

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:39.739
crosscutting vertically for you

01:54:39.806 --> 01:54:41.574
know of smaller communities are

01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:42.108
two meters that are less

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:45.178
visible- how but in terms of

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:47.213
reaching out to people that

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:51.317
isn't just geography based but-

01:54:51.384 --> 01:54:51.884
they'll they share a C. sure

01:54:51.951 --> 01:54:55.188
Sir. Culture or other L.

01:54:55.255 --> 01:54:57.290
characteristics are challenges

01:54:57.357 --> 01:54:59.325
in terms of you know fear of

01:54:59.392 --> 01:54:59.892
discrimination- they've C.

01:54:59.959 --> 01:55:01.094
thing. But they're more spread

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:01.661
out. Can you maybe speak to

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:03.563
that what kind of work that the

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:04.197
hi how are you trying to bridge

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:09.469
that. So I'll I'll briefly

01:55:09.535 --> 01:55:13.439
sharing try to. Take us back to

01:55:13.506 --> 01:55:13.940
one Klay side just for

01:55:14.007 --> 01:55:17.143
illustration to my comment I

01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:17.710
think that's that's a very

01:55:17.777 --> 01:55:21.114
critical point in and a lot of

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:21.614
the convening has been

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:23.416
geographic but when we talk

01:55:23.483 --> 01:55:25.318
about really penetrating

01:55:25.385 --> 01:55:27.186
community and doing work the

01:55:27.253 --> 01:55:29.422
first step was first even with

01:55:29.489 --> 01:55:31.524
geography usually folks want to

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:33.359
have meetings in downtown.

01:55:33.426 --> 01:55:35.595
Where four thousand square mile

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:37.397
county and not everybody

01:55:37.463 --> 01:55:39.165
identifies as Los Angeles and

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:41.334
so the idea that James shared

01:55:41.401 --> 01:55:43.236
about regional lies in the

01:55:43.303 --> 01:55:43.836
efforts so that communities

01:55:43.903 --> 01:55:45.338
could gather more locally

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:47.373
around the region they at least

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.007
identify with was a way to get

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:51.277
more local. I'm they're still

01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:53.212
be on that to your to your

01:55:53.279 --> 01:55:53.880
point which is which is spot on

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.682
our other communities other

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:57.617
identities that that clustering

01:55:57.684 --> 01:56:01.354
do if you look at some of our

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:03.389
graph you see that up Holly

01:56:03.456 --> 01:56:03.990
county has the largest native

01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:07.260
American- population in the

01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:09.228
country but you wouldn't guess

01:56:09.295 --> 01:56:09.862
that because there's not a city

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:11.431
that's majority native

01:56:11.497 --> 01:56:13.466
American. But yet we have court

01:56:13.533 --> 01:56:15.234
partners that we funded LGBTQ

01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:17.637
community so the funding spread

01:56:17.704 --> 01:56:19.672
out we convene a lot generally

01:56:19.739 --> 01:56:21.474
I think there are he Peter ship

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:23.209
folks African American

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:23.810
communities is not south LA

01:56:23.876 --> 01:56:25.645
it's up in antelope valley it's

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:27.714
dispersed across into Pomona in

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.549
other areas and so we have key

01:56:29.615 --> 01:56:31.551
organizations doing that work

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:33.653
it's just not convene than a

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:39.292
geography but- yes and part of

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:39.892
our strategy as you see in the

01:56:39.959 --> 01:56:40.493
graph is making sure we cover

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.661
that. The other thing I would

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:43.396
add to that question. Is really

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:44.030
important and I think when we

01:56:44.097 --> 01:56:45.365
dive into the complexity of how

01:56:45.431 --> 01:56:47.400
we're approaching. You know

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:48.067
thinking about what is the what

01:56:48.134 --> 01:56:49.469
is the strategy look like on

01:56:49.535 --> 01:56:50.036
the geography Bates versus

01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:51.637
population base right. There it

01:56:51.704 --> 01:56:53.606
comes down to a matter of

01:56:53.673 --> 01:56:54.240
tactics to write when we think

01:56:54.307 --> 01:56:55.575
about our door knocking

01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:57.243
strategies in as work. On

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:59.245
designing where are the areas

01:56:59.312 --> 01:56:59.812
were targeting in terms of

01:56:59.879 --> 01:57:01.381
certain neighborhoods that's

01:57:01.447 --> 01:57:03.483
great for specific card account

01:57:03.549 --> 01:57:04.117
areas and the reality at least

01:57:04.183 --> 01:57:05.551
for Long Beach. Is that you

01:57:05.618 --> 01:57:07.587
have very dense areas that are

01:57:07.653 --> 01:57:09.455
hard to reach where it's a

01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:11.624
multitude of different hard to

01:57:11.691 --> 01:57:13.493
come populations right so we're

01:57:13.559 --> 01:57:15.395
talking about engaging partners

01:57:15.461 --> 01:57:15.962
like the United can putting

01:57:16.028 --> 01:57:17.363
community interface commute

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.964
organization. What we could

01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:19.298
have teams of canvassers who

01:57:19.365 --> 01:57:19.866
speak Spanish and come I.

01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:21.601
because we don't know what's

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:22.168
gonna happen at the doors

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:23.636
right. But on the other level

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.538
there's also this- as a frame

01:57:25.605 --> 01:57:27.440
mentioned relying on

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:29.509
organizations that can reach

01:57:29.575 --> 01:57:31.577
popular in based hard account

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:33.446
communities right. To rely on

01:57:33.513 --> 01:57:35.248
kind of a network model where

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:37.350
gauging organizations that.

01:57:37.417 --> 01:57:39.252
Bill Ted of deep. Membership

01:57:39.318 --> 01:57:39.852
and a base to really use that

01:57:39.919 --> 01:57:41.421
and encourage folks to reach

01:57:41.487 --> 01:57:45.324
out to the networks as well so.

01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:47.493
Part of that challenge of

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:51.597
convene is trying to these two

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:52.198
the space for the second time

01:57:52.265 --> 01:57:57.470
but- does that. This is the

01:57:57.537 --> 01:57:58.037
developing now to take into

01:57:58.104 --> 01:58:03.609
consideration. Ins. One thing I

01:58:03.676 --> 01:58:05.445
really appreciate appreciate

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:06.078
about the framework of hard to

01:58:06.145 --> 01:58:06.679
count or geographic reach or

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:07.880
tactic is out when were able to

01:58:07.947 --> 01:58:09.715
talk about what area we may be

01:58:09.782 --> 01:58:11.484
focusing in on the tape im

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:11.951
reaching hard to count

01:58:12.018 --> 01:58:12.485
population Latino Spanish

01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:13.352
speaking but somebody else's

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:15.721
reaching- the Hindu population

01:58:15.788 --> 01:58:17.590
they know that a seller region

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:19.492
and we can cover the map an old

01:58:19.559 --> 01:58:20.126
Spanish will do a good go far

01:58:20.193 --> 01:58:21.828
but when it comes to like other

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:23.629
language pockets they also are

01:58:23.696 --> 01:58:25.465
tapping into physically what

01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:27.467
our locations folks are coming

01:58:27.533 --> 01:58:29.635
together at so that you can do

01:58:29.702 --> 01:58:31.604
if- physical- visible touch

01:58:31.671 --> 01:58:33.506
point with them- another. Is

01:58:33.573 --> 01:58:35.508
that when they're moving

01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:36.142
through geography maybe the C.

01:58:36.209 --> 01:58:37.577
the banner or the C. I hear

01:58:37.643 --> 01:58:39.545
about a training happening it's

01:58:39.612 --> 01:58:41.614
how many times do we need to

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:43.549
reinforce the message so that

01:58:43.616 --> 01:58:45.451
the goal is that they behave in

01:58:45.518 --> 01:58:46.052
a way that they fill out the

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.653
form not only I know about this

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:48.287
and but I'm not too sure if I'm

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:51.591
gonna do it so we have to

01:58:51.657 --> 01:58:52.091
combine they have to C.

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:53.759
consistently as it of the but

01:58:53.826 --> 01:58:56.996
they wake up to falling asleep

01:58:57.063 --> 01:58:58.898
when they're on social media

01:58:58.965 --> 01:59:00.733
opening up emails visually has

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:02.969
to be a camp. I could be

01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:04.837
physically and argue-

01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:05.438
neighborhoods but also in the

01:59:05.505 --> 01:59:07.139
difference is they engage with

01:59:07.206 --> 01:59:09.075
are people talking about it so

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:09.675
combining it is- our way of

01:59:09.742 --> 01:59:11.177
kind of understanding that we

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:12.879
need to get this message out

01:59:12.945 --> 01:59:17.049
there at least. Ten fifteen

01:59:17.116 --> 01:59:17.617
twenty times before I guess

01:59:17.683 --> 01:59:24.991
gonna do it. Tell. Is known for

01:59:25.057 --> 01:59:26.926
competing at hard to count

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.995
population were are on a G. two

01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:30.897
Q. presents meeting or if

01:59:30.963 --> 01:59:32.932
you're up agency that have

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:33.566
multiple sites are all of your

01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:35.167
sites echoing the same thing

01:59:35.234 --> 01:59:36.769
the become something-

01:59:36.836 --> 01:59:38.871
understood by everybody with

01:59:38.938 --> 01:59:41.107
thank you so much and the those

01:59:41.173 --> 01:59:42.975
were trying figure out to that

01:59:43.042 --> 01:59:43.543
region appreciate that you

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:45.177
recognize this issue- and then

01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:47.280
I know you're in the room when

01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:48.781
a person to the other question

01:59:48.848 --> 01:59:49.315
then I can pose a question

01:59:49.382 --> 01:59:50.917
again as a comment you know

01:59:50.983 --> 01:59:52.985
this by the time this before

01:59:53.052 --> 01:59:55.021
you really get in bill for the

01:59:55.087 --> 01:59:56.756
new year starts is. Sir

01:59:56.822 --> 01:59:58.758
thinking about I'm sure you've

01:59:58.824 --> 01:59:59.392
done this and you have a lot of

01:59:59.458 --> 01:59:59.959
different but- the end just

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:06.766
think about. Are there gaps

02:00:06.832 --> 02:00:07.300
there because of that- so

02:00:07.366 --> 02:00:09.101
appreciate that. You would say

02:00:09.168 --> 02:00:10.870
something about that. Yeah I

02:00:10.937 --> 02:00:11.504
just I just want to add to I

02:00:11.571 --> 02:00:13.072
think that like one of the

02:00:13.139 --> 02:00:13.706
things that we've talked about

02:00:13.773 --> 02:00:15.007
that we really- release all.

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:17.109
And the coconveners a we've

02:00:17.176 --> 02:00:18.778
admired about the approach that

02:00:18.844 --> 02:00:19.312
the California community

02:00:19.378 --> 02:00:20.980
foundation is taken. Is when we

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:22.782
think traditionally and talking

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:24.784
about. How we're engaging CBO's

02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:25.418
with to do census out reach we

02:00:25.484 --> 02:00:27.186
think of the organizations that

02:00:27.253 --> 02:00:29.255
how honestly a lot were listed

02:00:29.322 --> 02:00:30.957
in the steering committee right

02:00:31.023 --> 02:00:31.591
these. Large organizations that

02:00:31.657 --> 02:00:33.092
have capacity right and the

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:35.061
skills to do this. One of the-

02:00:35.127 --> 02:00:36.929
because we understand the

02:00:36.996 --> 02:00:37.530
importance of what's at stake

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:39.031
in the census count. There are

02:00:39.098 --> 02:00:41.000
regional approach and sub

02:00:41.067 --> 02:00:41.601
regional approach has allowed

02:00:41.667 --> 02:00:43.035
us to really engage. The small

02:00:43.102 --> 02:00:45.204
grassroots organizations that

02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:46.939
may not even have staff but

02:00:47.006 --> 02:00:47.473
they know people in the

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:48.874
neighborhoods they can hold

02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:49.508
those block parties. We have

02:00:49.575 --> 02:00:51.344
around the fiestas coming up in

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:52.979
December right we could

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:53.646
actually engage people from the

02:00:53.713 --> 02:00:55.214
community. And engage in that

02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:57.149
type of strategy and allow-

02:00:57.216 --> 02:00:58.985
resources to share resources.

02:00:59.051 --> 02:01:01.020
To allow them to participate

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:01.654
and get rid of some of those.

02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:03.389
Years so that's that's so

02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:05.358
important and I just want to

02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:05.992
split that up to emphasize. The

02:01:06.058 --> 02:01:09.028
you raised. I appreciate that

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:10.963
is someone who I'd like to see

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:13.032
if he teaches asset base me the

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:15.134
valve and we talk about the

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:17.136
power of association C. on the

02:01:17.203 --> 02:01:19.138
informal networks. And write

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:21.440
it. Because they made many I'll

02:01:21.507 --> 02:01:25.244
have stepped. Informal right

02:01:25.311 --> 02:01:27.413
and so oftentimes they're not

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:29.081
engage because they- had. Three

02:01:29.148 --> 02:01:29.682
other types of things but- we

02:01:29.749 --> 02:01:30.983
need for you how to reach out

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:31.584
to them because they can. They

02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:33.185
can help out thank you. Thank

02:01:33.252 --> 02:01:35.021
you Senate pan Senate and house.

02:01:35.087 --> 02:01:37.289
Yes I think all my questions

02:01:37.356 --> 02:01:37.957
have been answered this is just

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:39.191
more of a comment I'm really

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:40.993
blessed to have both of these-

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:41.527
incredible of people in my

02:01:41.594 --> 02:01:43.362
district in Senate district

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:45.197
thirty three both Cynthia and

02:01:45.264 --> 02:01:47.366
James and F. I. N. thank you so

02:01:47.433 --> 02:01:48.968
much for work as well as doctor

02:01:49.035 --> 02:01:49.635
Wilma Franco I know she's here

02:01:49.702 --> 02:01:51.270
as well and- I just wanna say

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:53.239
on behalf of our residents were

02:01:53.305 --> 02:01:54.974
really proud because we know

02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:55.574
that we have a lot of work to

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:57.410
do- in the district that is

02:01:57.476 --> 02:01:59.245
going to be. One of the most

02:01:59.311 --> 02:01:59.845
affected so thank you all for

02:01:59.912 --> 02:02:03.182
your work very much. In the new

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:05.084
wallpaper. Plenty of signs that

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:05.685
you can. And I have signed for

02:02:05.751 --> 02:02:07.253
everyone so they're they're

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:13.325
also. Yes also thank you all

02:02:13.392 --> 02:02:15.194
very much I know it's just

02:02:15.261 --> 02:02:17.263
Cannella another's have been

02:02:17.329 --> 02:02:19.098
working on this for a few years

02:02:19.165 --> 02:02:21.100
and trying to put together way

02:02:21.167 --> 02:02:21.667
in advance the sort of the

02:02:21.734 --> 02:02:25.171
structure of the organizing of

02:02:25.237 --> 02:02:29.075
organizers and organizations

02:02:29.141 --> 02:02:29.675
one thing and I plan to ask

02:02:29.742 --> 02:02:31.210
also on the state level that is

02:02:31.277 --> 02:02:37.083
visibly missing very much and

02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.683
he would be a shame to be left

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:41.387
out. Is labor. Organized labor

02:02:41.454 --> 02:02:43.322
obviously has resources

02:02:43.389 --> 02:02:45.491
organize and I don't mean just

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:47.393
like dollars the resources as

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:49.428
far as an organization many

02:02:49.495 --> 02:02:53.165
organizations- they tend to

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:55.334
have a high rate of activism

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:57.470
they tend to have a high rate

02:02:57.536 --> 02:03:01.440
of- turnout with union members

02:03:01.507 --> 02:03:03.175
because they're engaged with an

02:03:03.242 --> 02:03:03.809
organization as you find with

02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:07.079
other the group so I'm curious

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:09.281
to see at your level- the

02:03:09.348 --> 02:03:13.385
regional level- why that

02:03:13.452 --> 02:03:15.354
appears to be missing. It may

02:03:15.421 --> 02:03:15.855
not but it appears to be

02:03:15.921 --> 02:03:23.395
missing. So I appreciate that I

02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:27.166
think that. Definitely one

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:29.101
thing that's been cut-

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:29.769
communication has been there at

02:03:29.835 --> 02:03:31.403
a larger the alley census

02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:33.506
regional table does meet at a

02:03:33.572 --> 02:03:35.474
macro level so there's the

02:03:35.541 --> 02:03:37.476
regional meetings and a pipe

02:03:37.543 --> 02:03:39.378
into a larger median I know

02:03:39.445 --> 02:03:41.113
that they frequently-

02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:43.482
participate in that the what

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:45.251
you're seeing on the region

02:03:45.317 --> 02:03:45.885
always really the community led

02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:47.520
part I think we could do more.

02:03:47.586 --> 02:03:51.190
I'm I think that- having

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:51.757
leadership now at- complete

02:03:51.824 --> 02:03:55.261
count committee level- with SCA

02:03:55.327 --> 02:03:57.263
use presence there and in on

02:03:57.329 --> 02:03:59.198
mas apiece could really be

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:01.300
helpful in that I'm I know that

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:03.402
in our Leyva we had initial

02:04:03.469 --> 02:04:07.206
coordinating and- ordaining

02:04:07.273 --> 02:04:07.807
conversations with with the

02:04:07.873 --> 02:04:09.575
Allen county federation of

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:11.210
labor who was very helpful

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:11.777
they've been. Participants

02:04:11.844 --> 02:04:13.512
throughout I think it's not

02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:15.414
reflected here in terms of

02:04:15.481 --> 02:04:17.283
who's been funded or not and

02:04:17.349 --> 02:04:19.218
who are the- leads convening

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:21.320
but I think at this very stage

02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:21.887
to center pants point about

02:04:21.954 --> 02:04:23.489
who's missing. As we really

02:04:23.556 --> 02:04:25.624
hear the starting gun go off

02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:29.195
it'll be key. I will say both-

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:31.197
the county and the city through

02:04:31.263 --> 02:04:33.199
the complete count- local

02:04:33.265 --> 02:04:35.201
complete count have also been

02:04:35.267 --> 02:04:35.801
engaging in making sure to

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:37.570
communicate with labor as well.

02:04:37.636 --> 02:04:39.471
But I think there's- one more

02:04:39.538 --> 02:04:41.507
integration level needed to

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:43.576
drop down and I'm I'm glad that

02:04:43.642 --> 02:04:47.246
you raise that. Brought that up.

02:04:47.313 --> 02:04:47.780
I just add because there's

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:51.383
they're in. Anyway I just I

02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:53.219
just hope with de LA federation

02:04:53.285 --> 02:04:55.221
that they're formally

02:04:55.287 --> 02:04:57.389
broadband- so many different

02:04:57.456 --> 02:04:59.225
unions so many different

02:04:59.291 --> 02:04:59.825
geographical area so much of

02:04:59.892 --> 02:05:03.262
the geographical area. And I

02:05:03.329 --> 02:05:03.863
think if we don't do it early

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:07.199
it's a really really missed-

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:11.237
very big missed opportunity.

02:05:11.303 --> 02:05:13.205
And I will share that I'm they

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:15.474
I have shared weather at the

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:17.376
tables are as we've met with

02:05:17.443 --> 02:05:19.278
them- that they were working on

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:21.647
plans and we're doing that but

02:05:21.714 --> 02:05:22.248
I think now's the time to now

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:25.451
bring them all together. Mr

02:05:25.517 --> 02:05:27.519
squeal it is there a simple way

02:05:27.586 --> 02:05:31.457
of describing. How all of the

02:05:31.523 --> 02:05:33.359
efforts are being coordinated-

02:05:33.425 --> 02:05:37.329
I know you that was a big part

02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:37.930
of the presentation I so you

02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:39.331
give a body your sole goal.

02:05:39.398 --> 02:05:41.600
This so many efforts there's

02:05:41.667 --> 02:05:43.302
the city's there's the counties

02:05:43.369 --> 02:05:45.304
there's a school districts

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:47.439
there's community based groups

02:05:47.506 --> 02:05:49.375
there's always organized by one

02:05:49.441 --> 02:05:51.410
alliance and there's the state

02:05:51.477 --> 02:05:53.712
effort. Is there a simple way

02:05:53.779 --> 02:05:55.681
of describing this or is it

02:05:55.748 --> 02:05:57.816
just is so much out there that

02:05:57.883 --> 02:05:59.551
we ought to be glad there's

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:01.654
different groups yes it's the

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:02.288
state gives us the money not to

02:06:02.354 --> 02:06:07.626
Skinner. I'm it I've I it it is

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:09.929
and one is you do see a lot of

02:06:09.995 --> 02:06:11.664
different tables but what has

02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:13.599
been clearly defined among all

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:15.601
of us in the partners. Are very

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:17.603
early on was what will the

02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:19.438
county in the city's focus on

02:06:19.505 --> 02:06:21.473
and we see and participate and

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:23.676
support that. What will- the

02:06:23.742 --> 02:06:25.577
steering committee- with the

02:06:25.644 --> 02:06:27.713
support of C. C. F. focus on

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.748
which was on the ground the

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:33.419
CBO's we will we will see that

02:06:33.485 --> 02:06:34.053
so the county the city's went

02:06:34.119 --> 02:06:35.888
out there actively. Trying to

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:37.923
grant or fund philanthropy said

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.992
the ACBL structures what the

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:41.894
what the state put in place we

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:43.829
will then pull all our money so

02:06:43.896 --> 02:06:45.597
that we're not having

02:06:45.664 --> 02:06:46.131
organizations right seven

02:06:46.198 --> 02:06:47.900
different proposals whether our

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:49.969
own. Way of talking about the

02:06:50.035 --> 02:06:51.804
census and so. The simple way

02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:54.106
is we all identified the lanes

02:06:54.173 --> 02:06:55.808
needed and everybody trusted

02:06:55.874 --> 02:06:57.876
each other to run those lanes

02:06:57.943 --> 02:06:58.410
and today as you see the

02:06:58.477 --> 02:06:59.878
different presentations. We

02:06:59.945 --> 02:07:01.914
kind of each are talking about

02:07:01.981 --> 02:07:03.716
our lanes but we all

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:05.851
communicate and coordinate. It

02:07:05.918 --> 02:07:09.588
looks. Eight I'm- it does

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:11.590
though however look messy. And

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:13.959
so. But it's working because

02:07:14.026 --> 02:07:14.560
everybody has their lanes and

02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:17.863
we're doing. Thank you senator

02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:21.734
also seven number Berman. Quick

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:23.602
question for a friend you

02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:25.671
mentioned that that LA- has had

02:07:25.738 --> 02:07:27.906
a lot of state support also a

02:07:27.973 --> 02:07:29.742
lot of philanthropic support in

02:07:29.808 --> 02:07:31.543
is in a pretty good place-

02:07:31.610 --> 02:07:33.912
right now- at this stage of the

02:07:33.979 --> 02:07:37.549
game are there things that.

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:39.551
This region can share with

02:07:39.618 --> 02:07:40.219
other regions of the state that

02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:41.854
maybe don't have the resources

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:43.789
the for the private sector

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:45.891
resources- and maybe didn't get

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:47.526
us started as earlier as you

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:48.127
all have is there any sort of

02:07:48.193 --> 02:07:49.895
mechanism for sharing kind of

02:07:49.962 --> 02:07:51.864
best practices with some of the

02:07:51.930 --> 02:07:52.464
other regions of the state I

02:07:52.531 --> 02:07:53.966
know that you've got to focus

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:55.868
on on. The artist account

02:07:55.934 --> 02:07:57.870
county but- yeah what any any

02:07:57.936 --> 02:07:59.972
efforts are appreciated by some

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:01.907
others that are maybe a little

02:08:01.974 --> 02:08:03.909
further behind. Absolutely so

02:08:03.976 --> 02:08:05.944
first off say I think we have

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:09.648
had the states that Bob and

02:08:09.715 --> 02:08:10.249
philanthropy step up as well

02:08:10.315 --> 02:08:11.784
but I will be honest that a

02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:13.819
hundred organizations- is a lot

02:08:13.886 --> 02:08:17.823
but it's also not did what what

02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:19.625
we have funded so far in the

02:08:19.691 --> 02:08:21.627
twelve million is a little bit

02:08:21.693 --> 02:08:23.629
less than half of what

02:08:23.695 --> 02:08:24.263
different organizations stepped

02:08:24.329 --> 02:08:25.931
up to offer but I think we're

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:27.766
in a good place and then we

02:08:27.833 --> 02:08:29.768
were in any other time to meet

02:08:29.835 --> 02:08:31.770
this challenge. To your

02:08:31.837 --> 02:08:32.337
question about sharing best

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:33.972
practices one is every asset

02:08:34.039 --> 02:08:37.709
that we we're developing is

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:39.645
open and shareable with folks-

02:08:39.711 --> 02:08:42.014
the state has been working on

02:08:42.081 --> 02:08:43.982
sharing and communicating some

02:08:44.049 --> 02:08:45.818
of what we're doing but were

02:08:45.884 --> 02:08:48.053
also now- working with them and

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.988
thinking about how do we do

02:08:50.055 --> 02:08:51.757
that more formally maybe right

02:08:51.824 --> 02:08:53.992
before- we pass the starting

02:08:54.059 --> 02:08:57.763
line- but yes any asset that's

02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:58.330
being developed we're- ready

02:08:58.397 --> 02:09:01.934
and- eager to say. You know

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:02.501
this website that we created

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:03.735
for C. B. O.'s all that content

02:09:03.802 --> 02:09:06.071
can be. Strip use an and a

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:09.741
white labeled perfect. Vision I

02:09:09.808 --> 02:09:10.342
think on that note to I just

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:12.044
want to add to that when we

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:13.912
think about. For us to think

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:14.580
about like LA county as a whole

02:09:14.646 --> 02:09:16.148
right again the question of

02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:18.217
scale. It's been a really great

02:09:18.283 --> 02:09:20.152
I like I often refer to it as

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:21.887
like a an interesting social

02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:22.521
experiment like from that kind

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:24.189
of level to think about. Us as

02:09:24.256 --> 02:09:26.024
organizations is coconveners

02:09:26.091 --> 02:09:28.093
because the landscape in Long

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:29.995
Beach is similar yet different

02:09:30.062 --> 02:09:31.763
than Stella and it's very

02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:32.431
different from antelope valley

02:09:32.498 --> 02:09:34.099
right and- so many other

02:09:34.166 --> 02:09:35.801
valleys I live in Long Beach I

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:36.435
don't go to the other ballots

02:09:36.502 --> 02:09:38.237
but- are. Able our ability to

02:09:38.303 --> 02:09:40.139
come together and share how

02:09:40.205 --> 02:09:41.940
we're organizing approaching

02:09:42.007 --> 02:09:43.809
the region's has informed so

02:09:43.876 --> 02:09:44.409
many other strategies of how

02:09:44.476 --> 02:09:46.211
we're being more cohesive as a

02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:48.180
region Allen. And I think

02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:48.647
there's been no other

02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:50.249
opportunities where each of us

02:09:50.315 --> 02:09:51.884
have been asked in and are

02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:53.852
willing to share with other

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.921
folks across the state in terms

02:09:55.988 --> 02:09:56.522
of how we're approaching and-

02:09:56.588 --> 02:09:58.190
trying to understand what this

02:09:58.257 --> 02:09:58.757
reasonable containing looks

02:09:58.824 --> 02:10:01.927
like but also. What are what

02:10:01.994 --> 02:10:05.864
are these Beth strategies. For

02:10:05.931 --> 02:10:06.298
a reason sharing and

02:10:06.365 --> 02:10:06.899
collaborating bring photo the

02:10:06.965 --> 02:10:09.968
other two. And one thing I

02:10:10.035 --> 02:10:10.636
would add is I beat by virtue

02:10:10.702 --> 02:10:11.236
of the senses we've I've been

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:13.872
able to expand our network. So

02:10:13.939 --> 02:10:16.041
now becomes okay no- based off

02:10:16.108 --> 02:10:16.708
of the list provided by C. C.

02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:18.110
F. you're- being funded to do

02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:19.845
this work I want to meet you.

02:10:19.912 --> 02:10:20.445
What is your work look like

02:10:20.512 --> 02:10:22.281
what is your general day to day

02:10:22.347 --> 02:10:24.016
look like. And that allows us

02:10:24.082 --> 02:10:25.918
to buttock our capacity to be

02:10:25.984 --> 02:10:27.920
connected. So being able to

02:10:27.986 --> 02:10:28.520
build those relationships and

02:10:28.587 --> 02:10:30.022
not only share our

02:10:30.088 --> 02:10:31.857
understanding and strategies

02:10:31.924 --> 02:10:32.457
with the senses. Allows us to

02:10:32.524 --> 02:10:34.159
think differently about

02:10:34.226 --> 02:10:35.861
coronation critical ask each

02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:36.495
other. What band with the you

02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:38.330
have aren't what resources can

02:10:38.397 --> 02:10:40.265
you offer what made you not be

02:10:40.332 --> 02:10:42.134
able to do but how do you want

02:10:42.201 --> 02:10:43.869
to be engaged so it's- opening

02:10:43.936 --> 02:10:44.436
up those dialogue that are

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:46.138
critical and to move closer.

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:49.975
Towards April. Thank you. All

02:10:50.042 --> 02:10:50.542
right thank you soon member

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:53.912
vermin. Couple questions let me

02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:54.479
direct my question to you

02:10:54.546 --> 02:10:56.081
Mister Sebadoh and the other

02:10:56.148 --> 02:10:58.050
two of you can chime in when

02:10:58.116 --> 02:10:59.885
you think he's wrong. So Bob.

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:01.987
That's gonna be often so it in.

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:04.156
In in Orange County terrible

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:05.958
ventures it actually they

02:11:06.024 --> 02:11:07.859
engage in their own. Activity

02:11:07.926 --> 02:11:09.928
to raise additional psalms are

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:10.495
are you any of you engage in

02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:16.034
that activity. No not from

02:11:16.101 --> 02:11:18.003
filled philanthropic sources

02:11:18.070 --> 02:11:19.871
yeah cat California community

02:11:19.938 --> 02:11:20.405
foundation as a committee

02:11:20.472 --> 02:11:23.875
foundation we we're Los Angeles

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:24.443
county focus so we I. play

02:11:24.509 --> 02:11:26.178
space. In the past and

02:11:26.245 --> 02:11:28.013
historically we have been a

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:28.547
resource and a partner to

02:11:28.614 --> 02:11:30.048
Orange County community

02:11:30.115 --> 02:11:32.050
foundation sore level of

02:11:32.117 --> 02:11:33.952
engagement has been through any

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:34.586
communication and coordination

02:11:34.653 --> 02:11:36.255
with them as sort no I mean are

02:11:36.321 --> 02:11:38.290
you seeking sources from for

02:11:38.357 --> 02:11:41.860
example foundations. Themselves

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:43.996
to augment your efforts. We did

02:11:44.062 --> 02:11:46.064
and we received I'm little bit

02:11:46.131 --> 02:11:48.267
over I think we got up to

02:11:48.333 --> 02:11:51.870
seventeen point four million-

02:11:51.937 --> 02:11:54.039
so about ten million. Or twelve

02:11:54.106 --> 02:11:54.573
million in philanthropic

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.141
resources okay city the end is

02:11:56.208 --> 02:11:56.708
that part of your mission to

02:11:56.775 --> 02:12:00.345
reach out. What we said we set

02:12:00.412 --> 02:12:03.882
a goal early on working with

02:12:03.949 --> 02:12:04.416
the stern command and our

02:12:04.483 --> 02:12:05.884
partners of what would be what

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:06.518
we need are the real need was

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:08.253
identified at forty million we

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.090
said. Let's start at twenty and

02:12:12.157 --> 02:12:13.959
so twenty has been our goal and

02:12:14.026 --> 02:12:14.559
that's what we've been gates

02:12:14.626 --> 02:12:17.896
the state on the city of al a

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:18.363
the county and then

02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:20.198
philanthropy that stepped up

02:12:20.265 --> 02:12:22.000
with additional dollars. Let me

02:12:22.067 --> 02:12:22.567
ask you Jim who's your boss

02:12:22.634 --> 02:12:25.971
mistress Camilla. With my boss

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:28.106
yes. The community of Los

02:12:28.173 --> 02:12:30.409
Angeles but is there any one

02:12:30.475 --> 02:12:30.976
individual you view is your

02:12:31.043 --> 02:12:34.046
boss. The report any one

02:12:34.112 --> 02:12:34.646
individual until now Hernandez

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:36.448
the president of our California

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:36.982
coming from all right Sir

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:44.022
source of. It was my boss yes.

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:45.991
My boss is Christine Pettitte-

02:12:46.058 --> 02:12:46.558
executive director all right

02:12:46.625 --> 02:12:50.228
scores as. Orally doctor Wilma

02:12:50.295 --> 02:12:50.829
Franco and the communities we

02:12:50.896 --> 02:12:56.301
serve. Okay I'm in in do you

02:12:56.368 --> 02:13:00.105
report to- California of the

02:13:00.172 --> 02:13:00.706
complete count committee your

02:13:00.772 --> 02:13:04.042
complete count California. We

02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:06.411
report- and collaborate

02:13:06.478 --> 02:13:10.148
directly with the state census

02:13:10.215 --> 02:13:12.117
complete count office I'm and

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:14.353
that's who we work with

02:13:14.419 --> 02:13:14.953
directly on a day to day and

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:16.154
report on our contract activity

02:13:16.221 --> 02:13:17.989
and what we're doing on the

02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:18.623
ground with the resources okay

02:13:18.690 --> 02:13:20.592
and then same question I asked

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:22.160
the previous panel in terms of

02:13:22.227 --> 02:13:22.694
metrics one do you have

02:13:22.761 --> 02:13:26.198
performance measures. And to if

02:13:26.264 --> 02:13:26.865
you just give an example of one

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:28.266
of your performance measures-

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:30.435
sometimes referred to as

02:13:30.502 --> 02:13:34.106
metrics. Yes we will have a

02:13:34.172 --> 02:13:34.740
range of metrics in different

02:13:34.806 --> 02:13:38.176
areas so and I'll be on a our

02:13:38.243 --> 02:13:38.844
partner at the county shared a

02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:40.112
little bit about the media

02:13:40.178 --> 02:13:42.280
Metrix so those are M. we sure

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:42.881
communicated in and shared a

02:13:42.948 --> 02:13:46.084
number of those with the state

02:13:46.151 --> 02:13:46.651
there are all give you an

02:13:46.718 --> 02:13:50.155
example- one M. one metric for

02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:52.157
us was. Funding at least one

02:13:52.224 --> 02:13:52.791
hundred organizations to do get

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:54.359
out the count efforts and so

02:13:54.426 --> 02:13:56.395
we've reached that now begins

02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:58.497
the work with US C. of-

02:13:58.563 --> 02:14:00.432
establishing metrics around how

02:14:00.499 --> 02:14:02.467
many people were contacted

02:14:02.534 --> 02:14:04.336
through these various

02:14:04.403 --> 02:14:08.106
activities many facilities.

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:08.673
Were serving ask questioners

02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:12.177
and centers on a media side how

02:14:12.244 --> 02:14:14.379
much digital- reach that we

02:14:14.446 --> 02:14:16.214
have and if we have media

02:14:16.281 --> 02:14:18.350
partners out what what was the

02:14:18.417 --> 02:14:20.152
measurable the fact that I'm

02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:22.287
and so we're working to

02:14:22.354 --> 02:14:22.954
establish those because we have

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:24.523
the metrics what we're working

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:26.558
with the state on and have had

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:28.260
a lot of great support from the

02:14:28.326 --> 02:14:30.562
sort D. this how we collect.

02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:34.299
Those metrics. What is this so.

02:14:34.366 --> 02:14:36.601
Form is bitter our performance

02:14:36.668 --> 02:14:37.135
measures we want to fund a

02:14:37.202 --> 02:14:38.437
hundred different. Entities

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:42.107
right in then. The metric would

02:14:42.174 --> 02:14:42.707
be how are you doing in terms

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:44.409
of fun so you've you've met

02:14:44.476 --> 02:14:46.311
that but how are you doing in

02:14:46.378 --> 02:14:48.313
so in other places do you have

02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:50.282
and I'm gonna ask each of you

02:14:50.348 --> 02:14:52.217
and an example of a performance

02:14:52.284 --> 02:14:56.421
measure- and how you're-

02:14:56.488 --> 02:14:56.922
assessing whether you're

02:14:56.988 --> 02:14:57.422
meeting that performance

02:14:57.489 --> 02:15:02.194
measure. So I would say a bomb.

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:04.596
Yes and to keep but the example

02:15:04.663 --> 02:15:06.198
of the hundred organizations-

02:15:06.264 --> 02:15:08.266
up on the screen you see. We

02:15:08.333 --> 02:15:08.800
have performance measures

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:10.602
working with the our community

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:14.206
partners we sat what are the

02:15:14.272 --> 02:15:16.408
important- tactics on get up

02:15:16.475 --> 02:15:18.610
the count. That we need to move

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:20.512
our heart to count communities

02:15:20.579 --> 02:15:21.079
and we have been measuring

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:24.216
ourselves by how well have we

02:15:24.282 --> 02:15:26.485
done. In supporting each of the

02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:27.152
key tactics so up on the screen

02:15:27.219 --> 02:15:28.720
you see these little icon

02:15:28.787 --> 02:15:30.622
infographics. Back that gives

02:15:30.689 --> 02:15:32.357
you broken down. For the

02:15:32.424 --> 02:15:34.459
organizations we funded how

02:15:34.526 --> 02:15:36.461
many covered the top eight

02:15:36.528 --> 02:15:38.630
tactics that have been

02:15:38.697 --> 02:15:40.465
identified as effective for her

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:41.032
to count so that's I think a

02:15:41.099 --> 02:15:42.701
concrete example. Of how we're

02:15:42.767 --> 02:15:46.371
measuring our progress so far

02:15:46.438 --> 02:15:46.972
and right now it's been on

02:15:47.038 --> 02:15:48.607
getting resources out and

02:15:48.673 --> 02:15:50.542
making sure it's to the right

02:15:50.609 --> 02:15:52.310
things and in the right places.

02:15:52.377 --> 02:15:54.312
Long Beach forward. Terms of

02:15:54.379 --> 02:15:56.314
performance measures first some

02:15:56.381 --> 02:15:58.316
of our performance met- a lot

02:15:58.383 --> 02:16:00.452
of it met- sits on direct

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:01.052
outreach efforts and measuring

02:16:01.119 --> 02:16:02.454
the strength of our

02:16:02.521 --> 02:16:04.322
collaboration so for instance.

02:16:04.389 --> 02:16:04.956
On the direct out reach peace-

02:16:05.023 --> 02:16:06.625
part of our role as language

02:16:06.691 --> 02:16:08.326
Ford in each of our different

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:10.328
organizations that have gotten

02:16:10.395 --> 02:16:12.464
grants from- CCF which is the

02:16:12.531 --> 02:16:13.098
combination of funds. There are

02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:14.699
things like fifty thousand

02:16:14.766 --> 02:16:16.334
hours of direct outreach

02:16:16.401 --> 02:16:16.935
whether that's phone banking

02:16:17.002 --> 02:16:18.336
whether that's a door knocking

02:16:18.403 --> 02:16:18.904
to different hard to count

02:16:18.970 --> 02:16:20.672
communities that are identified

02:16:20.739 --> 02:16:22.541
gaps. Based off was being

02:16:22.607 --> 02:16:24.376
funded- who's doing what so not

02:16:24.442 --> 02:16:24.910
only is it looking at the

02:16:24.976 --> 02:16:26.444
people who are already at the

02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:28.313
table but what are the gaps

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:28.914
that are identified. And other

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:30.482
other organizations that are

02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:30.982
trust the messenger G.

02:16:31.049 --> 02:16:32.584
performance measures fifty

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:34.686
thousand. Hours in and how are

02:16:34.753 --> 02:16:38.390
you doing on that. Are we

02:16:38.456 --> 02:16:40.392
haven't started that we're in

02:16:40.458 --> 02:16:41.026
the process of hiring people so

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:42.460
that way Connie January we can

02:16:42.527 --> 02:16:44.563
start talking- so the other

02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:46.565
other isn't examples would be.

02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:48.433
A number of community events so

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:52.537
instead our organizations that

02:16:52.604 --> 02:16:54.506
use all logos for earlier we

02:16:54.573 --> 02:16:56.641
have a metric- bill mean.

02:16:56.708 --> 02:17:02.514
January and July meeting. On a

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:03.081
monthly basis that's right.

02:17:03.148 --> 02:17:06.718
Fact in a is. Because people

02:17:06.785 --> 02:17:07.319
want to meet more often than

02:17:07.385 --> 02:17:08.820
just once a month to. Get a

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:09.421
handle on all the coordination

02:17:09.487 --> 02:17:10.555
and even things like of the

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:11.122
community events not just

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:11.623
direct out reach in the

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:12.190
community like a fiesta or

02:17:12.257 --> 02:17:12.691
gathering. But also for

02:17:12.757 --> 02:17:13.325
stakeholders one of our metrics

02:17:13.391 --> 02:17:14.426
was organizing a- stakeholder

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:16.428
meeting for decision makers

02:17:16.494 --> 02:17:17.062
that long which forwarded. Two

02:17:17.128 --> 02:17:18.763
months ago and we brought

02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:20.532
together representatives from

02:17:20.599 --> 02:17:22.567
your respective offices from

02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:24.569
the city from education to talk

02:17:24.636 --> 02:17:25.136
about what organizations are

02:17:25.203 --> 02:17:28.506
doing C. this group does. So

02:17:28.573 --> 02:17:30.575
one of the ways we're looking

02:17:30.642 --> 02:17:31.176
at data situating it back on

02:17:31.242 --> 02:17:32.877
the twenty ten Allora scores

02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:36.448
were one of them is- engage

02:17:36.514 --> 02:17:37.048
fifty nonprofit organizations

02:17:37.115 --> 02:17:40.418
in census our reach that allows

02:17:40.485 --> 02:17:42.520
us to look at submatrix we're

02:17:42.587 --> 02:17:43.188
looking at well to what extent

02:17:43.254 --> 02:17:44.723
are folks using our senses

02:17:44.789 --> 02:17:46.691
event calendar put on by the

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:48.426
seller collaborative we can

02:17:48.493 --> 02:17:49.094
look at the back and metrics on

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:50.795
how many people are using the

02:17:50.862 --> 02:17:52.697
website do they sell for port

02:17:52.764 --> 02:17:54.733
value added are they able to

02:17:54.799 --> 02:17:55.367
coordinate with different- did

02:17:55.433 --> 02:17:56.801
you set a- goal for how many

02:17:56.868 --> 02:17:58.737
people are looking at the

02:17:58.803 --> 02:18:00.739
website. Not a goal with that

02:18:00.805 --> 02:18:01.439
because it's such a it's in its

02:18:01.506 --> 02:18:03.074
pilot phase you want to get at

02:18:03.141 --> 02:18:04.976
least two three months of data

02:18:05.043 --> 02:18:05.610
and to set that baseline and

02:18:05.677 --> 02:18:08.546
then start to analyze what

02:18:08.613 --> 02:18:09.180
would be a reasonable goal and

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:10.915
mobilize towards it so some of

02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:12.684
the things are newer but for us

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:13.351
we felt that the fifty C. Beals

02:18:13.418 --> 02:18:15.020
is reasonable our network

02:18:15.086 --> 02:18:16.921
provides twelve already and M.

02:18:16.988 --> 02:18:18.923
moving through the Ellie are C.

02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:20.592
T. convening than just seen at

02:18:20.659 --> 02:18:21.259
the different fine and she's an

02:18:21.326 --> 02:18:22.827
who's represented a who's not

02:18:22.894 --> 02:18:24.796
there we believe that fifty is

02:18:24.863 --> 02:18:26.698
gonna allow was the range we

02:18:26.765 --> 02:18:28.633
need- across the three

02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:30.602
categories of out reach. And

02:18:30.669 --> 02:18:31.102
parts come population

02:18:31.169 --> 02:18:34.606
geographic so that not gold has

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:35.040
allowed us to have

02:18:35.106 --> 02:18:36.841
conversations to develop some

02:18:36.908 --> 02:18:38.810
goals like all the ten cities

02:18:38.877 --> 02:18:40.445
and to incorporate areas

02:18:40.512 --> 02:18:42.614
actually being reached so it's

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:43.248
a good anchor for us but we're

02:18:43.314 --> 02:18:44.916
also committed to learning

02:18:44.983 --> 02:18:46.785
feedback loop process to in

02:18:46.851 --> 02:18:48.620
this complete cal California or

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:50.689
they enquiring as to your

02:18:50.755 --> 02:18:51.222
metrics your performance

02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:52.891
measures and whether you're

02:18:52.957 --> 02:18:54.726
meeting them or not. Sorry KP

02:18:54.793 --> 02:18:56.861
so complete cal California

02:18:56.928 --> 02:18:58.563
that's the over arching

02:18:58.630 --> 02:18:59.230
organization as I understand it

02:18:59.297 --> 02:19:01.066
or are they enquiring as to

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:02.934
whether you're setting

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:04.769
performance measures whether

02:19:04.836 --> 02:19:06.705
you're you know setting of

02:19:06.771 --> 02:19:07.305
you're creating metrics that

02:19:07.372 --> 02:19:09.040
kind of thing yes we've worked

02:19:09.107 --> 02:19:11.076
collaboratively with them as

02:19:11.142 --> 02:19:11.509
we've developed our

02:19:11.576 --> 02:19:12.911
implementation plan and I've

02:19:12.977 --> 02:19:14.779
submitted our reports on the

02:19:14.846 --> 02:19:16.915
progress of that we've also had

02:19:16.981 --> 02:19:18.750
meetings with the sword team-

02:19:18.817 --> 02:19:20.819
to start thinking about how

02:19:20.885 --> 02:19:22.921
will you be collecting those

02:19:22.987 --> 02:19:24.889
metrics what support do you

02:19:24.956 --> 02:19:28.960
need from the state- without so

02:19:29.027 --> 02:19:30.995
we have been to some. Thank I

02:19:31.062 --> 02:19:33.064
think that- part of what our

02:19:33.131 --> 02:19:33.665
conversations are as far as-

02:19:33.732 --> 02:19:34.833
how many people do you think.

02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:35.433
That you can reach were at a

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:37.235
stage where. We don't want to

02:19:37.302 --> 02:19:40.772
limit ourselves and say we

02:19:40.839 --> 02:19:41.339
should Pat ourselves on the

02:19:41.406 --> 02:19:41.873
back of we reach a million

02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:43.141
people because- the charge

02:19:43.208 --> 02:19:45.176
given to us by you all and the

02:19:45.243 --> 02:19:47.312
state was. Get everyone counted

02:19:47.378 --> 02:19:50.749
and so- as far as metrics

02:19:50.815 --> 02:19:51.382
though the state has been very

02:19:51.449 --> 02:19:52.851
supportive and we've been

02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:53.451
reporting. On going and they

02:19:53.518 --> 02:19:55.053
give us feedback and share

02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:56.955
their expectations with and I

02:19:57.021 --> 02:19:58.757
realize it's hard you know so

02:19:58.823 --> 02:19:59.357
for exams some things are are

02:19:59.424 --> 02:20:00.992
quantifiable number of a

02:20:01.059 --> 02:20:02.761
numerators that you've hired

02:20:02.827 --> 02:20:03.428
number of click whatever it may

02:20:03.495 --> 02:20:05.263
be. It's much more challenging

02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:07.232
in this operation one because

02:20:07.298 --> 02:20:09.167
the time spent but also because

02:20:09.234 --> 02:20:10.902
of the more amorphous nature.

02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:11.436
Business you say they are

02:20:11.503 --> 02:20:13.138
revenue goal is you know a

02:20:13.204 --> 02:20:14.939
hundred dollars and we're at

02:20:15.006 --> 02:20:17.008
ninety so. We need to earn

02:20:17.075 --> 02:20:17.542
another ten dollars much

02:20:17.609 --> 02:20:20.779
easier- okay biggest challenges

02:20:20.845 --> 02:20:23.248
is. Briefly other than money

02:20:23.314 --> 02:20:23.882
what's your biggest challenges.

02:20:23.948 --> 02:20:25.150
Each of you. Biggest single

02:20:25.216 --> 02:20:29.254
challenge. Other than the size

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:31.122
of the county in the two

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:32.857
thousand right hard to counts

02:20:32.924 --> 02:20:35.226
tracks I'm I think I'm gonna

02:20:35.293 --> 02:20:37.162
mention this it's really time

02:20:37.228 --> 02:20:39.097
and it's not this is not some

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:41.065
amorphous challenge it's real

02:20:41.132 --> 02:20:43.001
it's taking every day I would

02:20:43.067 --> 02:20:45.003
have to say that the biggest

02:20:45.069 --> 02:20:45.637
challenge for us right now is

02:20:45.703 --> 02:20:47.138
organization to starting to

02:20:47.205 --> 02:20:49.040
deploy their folks is just the

02:20:49.107 --> 02:20:51.042
continuous guidelines that the

02:20:51.109 --> 02:20:51.676
census puts out we're beginning

02:20:51.743 --> 02:20:55.046
to feel like I'm it's really

02:20:55.113 --> 02:20:56.981
discouraging to wanting to talk

02:20:57.048 --> 02:20:57.615
to someone about the senses of

02:20:57.682 --> 02:20:59.250
the federal or the federal

02:20:59.317 --> 02:21:01.186
census has put out several

02:21:01.252 --> 02:21:03.087
guidelines that. Use words like

02:21:03.154 --> 02:21:05.256
it's federally prohibited to

02:21:05.323 --> 02:21:07.125
contact someone or talk to them

02:21:07.192 --> 02:21:07.759
about certain things you can't

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:09.327
make phone calls to people I'm

02:21:09.394 --> 02:21:12.997
we continue to use our own

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:13.598
discretion on that but I think

02:21:13.665 --> 02:21:15.266
the biggest challenges just

02:21:15.333 --> 02:21:19.003
kind of the bureau start a

02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:19.537
focus on regulating how

02:21:19.604 --> 02:21:21.272
communities can talk to each

02:21:21.339 --> 02:21:23.208
other about the senses- that

02:21:23.274 --> 02:21:25.076
were concerned would be- a

02:21:25.143 --> 02:21:27.212
challenge moving forward and I

02:21:27.278 --> 02:21:30.982
think the other one which the

02:21:31.049 --> 02:21:33.218
state- legislature and governor

02:21:33.284 --> 02:21:35.386
are going to have been so right

02:21:35.453 --> 02:21:37.121
in doing this was the passage

02:21:37.188 --> 02:21:39.190
of a B. fifteen sixty three. By

02:21:39.257 --> 02:21:41.092
assembly member Miguel Santana

02:21:41.159 --> 02:21:43.228
go and- Gonzalez around

02:21:43.294 --> 02:21:45.396
creating a census bill of

02:21:45.463 --> 02:21:47.432
rights in California to make

02:21:47.498 --> 02:21:51.402
sure. That some. Power for into

02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:53.171
T. like our state government is

02:21:53.238 --> 02:21:55.173
insuring are Californians that

02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:57.075
they do have rights and who can

02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:59.077
and can't participate I think.

02:21:59.143 --> 02:21:59.744
On that will be very helpful to

02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:01.279
meet those challenges well most

02:22:01.346 --> 02:22:03.514
that's most useful if you can.

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:05.316
Provide us the specific

02:22:05.383 --> 02:22:07.452
challenges that are being posed

02:22:07.518 --> 02:22:09.187
by the federal government that

02:22:09.254 --> 02:22:11.422
will help us because Anderson

02:22:11.489 --> 02:22:13.124
pan will get resolved so right.

02:22:13.191 --> 02:22:15.260
Yes and he will it. Right in

02:22:15.326 --> 02:22:17.295
terms of singular challenge I

02:22:17.362 --> 02:22:19.631
think going back to this idea

02:22:19.697 --> 02:22:21.199
of scale but also what senator

02:22:21.266 --> 02:22:23.201
that also brought up around how

02:22:23.268 --> 02:22:23.801
do we need lead talk about

02:22:23.868 --> 02:22:25.536
what's going on. We just can't

02:22:25.603 --> 02:22:27.472
and I think what what has

02:22:27.538 --> 02:22:29.474
happened- because of the

02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:31.409
efforts of C. C. F. and all of

02:22:31.476 --> 02:22:31.976
our convening organizations

02:22:32.043 --> 02:22:33.444
with the we count campaign. Is

02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:35.480
that the CBO- effort to reach

02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:37.582
hard account communities is

02:22:37.649 --> 02:22:39.284
very well organized. But and I

02:22:39.350 --> 02:22:41.252
can't say that for all of the

02:22:41.319 --> 02:22:41.886
other sectors where they have

02:22:41.953 --> 02:22:43.321
that hasn't been years of this

02:22:43.388 --> 02:22:45.323
kind of planning. And what we

02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:47.292
struggle with is trying to in

02:22:47.358 --> 02:22:49.260
good faith think about how do

02:22:49.327 --> 02:22:51.195
we collaborate and connect with

02:22:51.262 --> 02:22:51.696
other local levels of

02:22:51.763 --> 02:22:53.564
government anchor institutions

02:22:53.631 --> 02:22:55.667
are education healthcare labor

02:22:55.733 --> 02:22:57.302
right all of these other.

02:22:57.368 --> 02:22:57.969
Sectors that just aren't in the

02:22:58.036 --> 02:22:59.504
same place where we are at and

02:22:59.570 --> 02:23:01.372
our terms of our efforts in

02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:01.973
outreach and recognizing that

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:03.541
partnership moves at the speed

02:23:03.608 --> 02:23:05.610
of trust. And for some of these

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:07.312
institutions and its particular

02:23:07.378 --> 02:23:07.879
with our organizations that

02:23:07.946 --> 02:23:09.580
just isn't there and

02:23:09.647 --> 02:23:10.181
unfortunately we don't have

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.716
time to build that trust so

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:15.420
it's really relying on- people

02:23:15.486 --> 02:23:16.020
within different institutions.

02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:17.722
To put a lot of trust up front

02:23:17.789 --> 02:23:19.357
and I'm thankful for

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:21.426
individuals like Julian so new

02:23:21.492 --> 02:23:22.026
that Kevin Jackson here in the

02:23:22.093 --> 02:23:23.461
city of Long Beach of

02:23:23.528 --> 02:23:25.463
understood that. To really

02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:27.298
think about how do we start

02:23:27.365 --> 02:23:27.865
breaking down these barriers

02:23:27.932 --> 02:23:31.469
thanks. This contest. I think

02:23:31.536 --> 02:23:32.070
it's been able to expand a who

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:33.504
are partners are. One example

02:23:33.571 --> 02:23:34.072
in cell is going to be our

02:23:34.138 --> 02:23:35.506
parent volunteer groups. So

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:37.375
while we know that the

02:23:37.442 --> 02:23:38.009
different institutions like L.

02:23:38.076 --> 02:23:39.644
USY are preparing to support

02:23:39.711 --> 02:23:41.479
those parents. When we talk to

02:23:41.546 --> 02:23:42.113
them on the ground the C. we

02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:43.648
really want to have coffee and

02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:45.450
census talks conscience senses

02:23:45.516 --> 02:23:46.117
has been one of the things they

02:23:46.184 --> 02:23:47.452
brought to the table. But we

02:23:47.518 --> 02:23:48.019
know that also takes some

02:23:48.086 --> 02:23:49.821
resources that maybe take some

02:23:49.887 --> 02:23:51.656
trainings for them. So as we

02:23:51.723 --> 02:23:53.658
think about- what are the best

02:23:53.725 --> 02:23:55.393
ways to engage particularly

02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:57.528
those parents groups. On one of

02:23:57.595 --> 02:23:58.196
the things that we were really

02:23:58.262 --> 02:23:59.697
excited about and I'm going to

02:23:59.764 --> 02:24:01.399
follow up with our full. Our

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:02.000
friends at the city and the

02:24:02.066 --> 02:24:03.735
county. Ellie city in the

02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:05.470
goodwill ambassador program not

02:24:05.536 --> 02:24:06.004
only was able to provide a

02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:07.705
volunteer Steven for folks

02:24:07.772 --> 02:24:09.507
getting trained. But is also

02:24:09.574 --> 02:24:10.108
offering a mini grant to hold

02:24:10.174 --> 02:24:11.809
an event in your community. So

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:13.878
when we hear about things like

02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:15.546
that in the southeast we want

02:24:15.613 --> 02:24:17.749
to be able to- learn how to

02:24:17.815 --> 02:24:18.383
replicate that because that's

02:24:18.449 --> 02:24:19.584
what we're hearing. From our

02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:21.619
parents from our cousins from

02:24:21.686 --> 02:24:25.556
our youth. I think all we want

02:24:25.623 --> 02:24:27.692
to get active to but what is

02:24:27.759 --> 02:24:28.326
the right. For stern to support

02:24:28.393 --> 02:24:31.896
that design. Thirty thank you

02:24:31.963 --> 02:24:32.497
less because it's your mother

02:24:32.563 --> 02:24:35.933
watching. The but if she has hi

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.735
mommy yeah okay thank you all

02:24:37.802 --> 02:24:38.336

confident we can all read so if

02:25:23.648 --> 02:25:24.248

for making local educational

02:25:59.884 --> 02:26:01.719
agency census out reach a

02:26:01.786 --> 02:26:03.788
budget priority the trust that

you placed in us and the

02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:07.725
investment that you have made

02:26:07.792 --> 02:26:09.627
is really critical to a

02:26:09.694 --> 02:26:11.662
positive outcome on the census.

02:26:11.729 --> 02:26:14.065
After all all of the research

02:26:14.132 --> 02:26:15.733
unequivocally shows that

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:17.768
schools and teachers are the

02:26:17.835 --> 02:26:21.639
trusted messengers we all come

02:26:21.706 --> 02:26:23.641
from cultures where the words

02:26:23.708 --> 02:26:25.643
of love my yes throughout or in

02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:27.845
my S. throw are held in high

02:26:27.912 --> 02:26:29.647
esteem the money that's been

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:31.749
allocated to what now amounts

02:26:31.816 --> 02:26:33.818
to nine hundred and sixty three

02:26:33.885 --> 02:26:35.620
schools we will be put to great

02:26:35.686 --> 02:26:37.989
use by the forty three find it

02:26:38.055 --> 02:26:39.624
hard to count school districts.

02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:40.191
So I'd like to speak to you

02:26:40.258 --> 02:26:41.893
about the efforts we've we have

02:26:41.959 --> 02:26:43.928
under way but let me start

02:26:43.995 --> 02:26:44.428
first by addressing the

02:26:44.495 --> 02:26:47.632
curriculum I it in the census

02:26:47.698 --> 02:26:49.867
curriculum census twenty twenty

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:52.003
count me in it's been an in

02:26:52.069 --> 02:26:54.038
process over the past several

02:26:54.105 --> 02:26:56.107
years the purpose is to educate

02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:57.708
students and teachers the

02:26:57.775 --> 02:26:59.777
historical importance of the

02:26:59.844 --> 02:27:03.714
sexes its function the use of

02:27:03.781 --> 02:27:05.883
data the importance of the

02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:07.985
complete count. And advocacy

02:27:08.052 --> 02:27:10.087
products of projects and I. one

02:27:10.154 --> 02:27:11.989
under find out because the

02:27:12.056 --> 02:27:12.623
project because I think that's

02:27:12.690 --> 02:27:19.764
really really important. Up the.

02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:20.431
The our killer was specifically

02:27:20.498 --> 02:27:21.999
designed it was created by

02:27:22.066 --> 02:27:22.567
teachers it was tested. To

02:27:22.633 --> 02:27:23.734
online to California history

02:27:23.801 --> 02:27:24.335
social science standards it's

02:27:24.402 --> 02:27:25.937
short it's concise it's easily

02:27:26.003 --> 02:27:28.039
implemented. And it includes a

02:27:28.105 --> 02:27:31.809
taking action type approach to

02:27:31.876 --> 02:27:33.744
energize and to equip students

02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:35.880
to organize campaigns to also

02:27:35.947 --> 02:27:36.380
assist in getting out a

02:27:36.447 --> 02:27:38.182
complete count. And examples

02:27:38.249 --> 02:27:40.151
include student develop posters

02:27:40.218 --> 02:27:43.821
PSAs brochures assemblies

02:27:43.888 --> 02:27:45.823
presentations to parents. Add

02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:47.792
to their community groups. I

02:27:47.858 --> 02:27:49.760
see that those that those

02:27:49.827 --> 02:27:51.729
projects are really important

02:27:51.796 --> 02:27:52.363
because- what's become really

02:27:52.430 --> 02:27:54.131
clear to us. Is that as we

02:27:54.198 --> 02:27:56.000
rolled out the census

02:27:56.067 --> 02:27:58.002
curriculum we married it with

02:27:58.069 --> 02:28:00.071
with legos outreach efforts.

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:02.139
And in the past couple of

02:28:02.206 --> 02:28:03.908
months we convened a hundred

02:28:03.975 --> 02:28:06.010
sixteen. Our educators in LA

02:28:06.077 --> 02:28:08.112
county. Twenty two came from

02:28:08.179 --> 02:28:10.081
the out reach funded districts.

02:28:10.147 --> 02:28:12.016
And we had some teachers

02:28:12.083 --> 02:28:14.051
actually bring students to are

02:28:14.118 --> 02:28:16.087
convening. And it was amazing

02:28:16.153 --> 02:28:18.055
when you saw the students and

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:20.024
their interest and they're of.

02:28:20.091 --> 02:28:22.126
Absolute interest because they

02:28:22.193 --> 02:28:25.896
get it and we know that kids. A

02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:26.564
large part some of our students

02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:27.999
are going to play a very very

02:28:28.065 --> 02:28:31.736
important part. In this in the

02:28:31.802 --> 02:28:33.738
census in working with their

02:28:33.804 --> 02:28:35.840
families because after all when

02:28:35.906 --> 02:28:37.742
we look. At the role that

02:28:37.808 --> 02:28:38.309
students play historically

02:28:38.376 --> 02:28:39.977
sometimes they've been

02:28:40.044 --> 02:28:42.046
translators and interpreters

02:28:42.113 --> 02:28:44.015
for our community this time out

02:28:44.081 --> 02:28:46.017
what's really fascinating is

02:28:46.083 --> 02:28:47.752
that those kids are tech savvy

02:28:47.818 --> 02:28:49.987
they know how to do it. And as

02:28:50.054 --> 02:28:51.889
long as they have access to the

02:28:51.956 --> 02:28:53.858
internet and they have access

02:28:53.924 --> 02:28:54.458
to the resources they're gonna

02:28:54.525 --> 02:28:56.294
lead and help lead their

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.229
parents. In making sure that

02:28:58.296 --> 02:29:01.866
the census is completed. So I'm

02:29:01.932 --> 02:29:03.868
as part of the curriculum that

02:29:03.934 --> 02:29:04.402
that we have it's really

02:29:04.468 --> 02:29:06.270
focused and we're hoping that

02:29:06.337 --> 02:29:08.239
there will be school districts

02:29:08.306 --> 02:29:12.276
and some of the schools that

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:16.047
will focus on. Our. Having

02:29:16.113 --> 02:29:16.681
students play and continue to

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:19.884
play that that role in part by.

02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:22.053
Part by perhaps of sponsoring

02:29:22.119 --> 02:29:24.255
online video competitions or

02:29:24.322 --> 02:29:26.257
other creative type efforts

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:28.292
aimed at students because we

02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:30.161
understand they're the ones

02:29:30.227 --> 02:29:31.862
that are going to benefit

02:29:31.929 --> 02:29:33.998
ultimately of from the census

02:29:34.065 --> 02:29:36.200
outreach so let me talk a

02:29:36.267 --> 02:29:37.868
little bit about the outrage

02:29:37.935 --> 02:29:38.436
that we have under way on

02:29:38.502 --> 02:29:40.204
December third earlier this

02:29:40.271 --> 02:29:41.872
month we convened

02:29:41.939 --> 02:29:44.041
representatives. From the forty

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:45.876
three school districts

02:29:45.943 --> 02:29:46.444
virtually all of them were

02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:48.279
present and those that were not

02:29:48.346 --> 02:29:50.147
present were present virtually

02:29:50.214 --> 02:29:52.116
of we anticipated the

02:29:52.183 --> 02:29:54.018
importance of having nonprofit

02:29:54.085 --> 02:29:56.120
partners present so some of the

02:29:56.187 --> 02:29:58.089
people that came and spoke to

02:29:58.155 --> 02:29:59.990
you earlier today we're at our

02:30:00.057 --> 02:30:01.892
convening- and it was a

02:30:01.959 --> 02:30:04.028
fabulous. A fabulous fabulous

02:30:04.095 --> 02:30:06.163
convening all we had nonprofits

02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:08.032
such as not Leyva we have non

02:30:08.099 --> 02:30:10.034
profits such as- the

02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:10.634
advancement project the other

02:30:10.701 --> 02:30:12.269
thing we did which was

02:30:12.336 --> 02:30:14.105
absolutely critical is that we

02:30:14.171 --> 02:30:16.207
used the resources from the

02:30:16.273 --> 02:30:17.975
California community foundation

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:18.376
and we provided a

02:30:18.442 --> 02:30:21.979
communications type training

02:30:22.046 --> 02:30:22.613
for the school districts that

02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:25.950
were there. Our thanks to the

02:30:26.016 --> 02:30:26.584
of the work of fountain which I

02:30:26.650 --> 02:30:28.419
have to tell you was absolutely

02:30:28.486 --> 02:30:31.956
fabulous it's online it's a

02:30:32.022 --> 02:30:34.125
open sourced and it and it

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:34.759
really allows school districts

02:30:34.825 --> 02:30:36.494
do the things that they need to

02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:38.262
do which is to have ready

02:30:38.329 --> 02:30:41.966
resources in hand ready to ride

02:30:42.032 --> 02:30:43.968
because really the I. which

02:30:44.034 --> 02:30:44.568
piece of this. Is gonna come

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:47.972
face to face person to person

02:30:48.038 --> 02:30:48.506
and allowing teachers and

02:30:48.572 --> 02:30:50.341
allowing educators to do that

02:30:50.408 --> 02:30:52.410
work in the time to do that

02:30:52.476 --> 02:30:54.278
work is really critical and not

02:30:54.345 --> 02:30:58.082
have it bad I- doing things

02:30:58.149 --> 02:31:00.017
like having to create a

02:31:00.084 --> 02:31:02.186
separate documents but to be

02:31:02.253 --> 02:31:04.155
able to share all the resources

02:31:04.221 --> 02:31:04.789
so that was certainly the work

02:31:04.855 --> 02:31:06.190
that we were doing a we're

02:31:06.257 --> 02:31:10.161
continuing to do that. We look

02:31:10.227 --> 02:31:16.133
forward to- take to continue to

02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:16.734
partner with all of the school

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:17.268
district. Thank you ms and

02:31:17.334 --> 02:31:20.438
rather. Our next Los Angeles

02:31:20.504 --> 02:31:20.938
unified school district

02:31:21.005 --> 02:31:22.072
misread. Thank you so much

committee members it's an honor

02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:24.275
to be part of this panel. On

02:31:24.341 --> 02:31:26.177
behalf of Elian the fight

02:31:26.243 --> 02:31:28.078
school district. For LA unified

02:31:28.145 --> 02:31:30.147
and many school districts in

02:31:30.214 --> 02:31:32.082
the state so much is at stake.

02:31:32.149 --> 02:31:32.650
When it comes to serving our

02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:36.153
highest needs population. LA

02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:36.787
unified is the largest school

02:31:36.854 --> 02:31:38.456
district and state as you met

02:31:38.522 --> 02:31:40.558
me very well no. And we are

02:31:40.624 --> 02:31:42.560
work very well positioned to

02:31:42.626 --> 02:31:44.395
reach a wide range of hard to

02:31:44.462 --> 02:31:46.130
count populations and

02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:48.132
leveraging the services and

02:31:48.199 --> 02:31:50.234
resources. Over thirteen

02:31:50.301 --> 02:31:52.236
hundred and twenty two schools

02:31:52.303 --> 02:31:54.071
and centres. Into activating

02:31:54.138 --> 02:31:58.209
them into census- action kiosks

02:31:58.275 --> 02:32:00.277
and other- and other.

02:32:00.344 --> 02:32:02.346
Activities and targeted areas

02:32:02.413 --> 02:32:04.081
were hardest account

02:32:04.148 --> 02:32:06.150
communities. The district has

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:08.252
already incorporated a lot of

02:32:08.319 --> 02:32:10.354
the information for census and

02:32:10.421 --> 02:32:12.590
to our we are one LA unified

02:32:12.656 --> 02:32:16.093
campaign- much of our efforts

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:18.162
this year and into next year we

02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:18.796
are leveraging the we are one

02:32:18.863 --> 02:32:20.531
LA unified campaign and to

02:32:20.598 --> 02:32:24.235
making it. We are one LA

02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:26.136
unified make LA unified count.

02:32:26.203 --> 02:32:28.305
The district has. Over sixty

02:32:28.372 --> 02:32:30.241
thousand employees which we

02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:34.245
hope we will leverage as our

02:32:34.311 --> 02:32:36.280
senses messengers we have

02:32:36.347 --> 02:32:38.182
embedded partners not only-

02:32:38.249 --> 02:32:40.451
internally with our labor

02:32:40.518 --> 02:32:42.253
partners and associations. We

Long Beach you heard from

02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:36.527
Mister Jackson earlier. The

02:35:36.593 --> 02:35:38.662
first effort we've we did-

02:35:38.729 --> 02:35:40.497
about a month ago is our

02:35:40.564 --> 02:35:42.566

02:35:43.133 --> 02:35:44.735
unified school district

02:35:44.802 --> 02:35:48.439
stakeholders- that touches over

02:35:48.505 --> 02:35:49.006
two hundred thousand people.

02:35:49.073 --> 02:35:49.573
Are just talking about the

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:52.476
senses the importance and- if

02:35:52.543 --> 02:35:54.411
we don't count all the people

02:35:54.478 --> 02:35:56.513
in our particular city. Then

02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:58.415
there will be certain cut so we

02:35:58.482 --> 02:35:58.982
were very transparent in the

02:35:59.049 --> 02:36:06.523
importance of that. We to a

02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:08.625
plan to utilize our family

02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:10.527
resource centers to house some

02:36:10.594 --> 02:36:14.498

02:36:16.767 --> 02:36:18.669
count communities- in the city

02:36:18.736 --> 02:36:22.439

02:36:27.544 --> 02:36:28.679
the entire. Spectrum of the

02:36:28.746 --> 02:36:32.783

where they could get more

02:36:58.776 --> 02:37:00.544

talk with their parents and

02:38:14.718 --> 02:38:15.285
tell them about the importance

02:38:15.352 --> 02:38:18.755
of the senses so we have-

02:39:48.812 --> 02:39:50.981
yeah- that made me realize that

02:39:51.048 --> 02:39:52.749
that could be a great-

02:39:52.816 --> 02:39:54.818
potential resource for

02:39:54.885 --> 02:39:56.853
enumerators- and then so. Would

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:58.755
encourage you to let them know

02:39:58.822 --> 02:40:00.757
about the opportunities- I did

02:40:00.824 --> 02:40:01.391
confirm with my staff that. You

02:40:01.458 --> 02:40:03.026
know enumerators do not have to

02:40:03.093 --> 02:40:05.228
be full time- they can working

02:40:05.295 --> 02:40:06.930
nights and weekends. So

02:40:06.997 --> 02:40:08.932
another. Resource could be-

02:40:08.999 --> 02:40:12.936
substitute teachers- and folks

02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:13.537
who were just looking to make

02:40:13.603 --> 02:40:16.940
you know some some extra money-

02:40:17.007 --> 02:40:19.009
because were were falling short

02:40:19.076 --> 02:40:19.576
need to get as creative as

02:40:19.643 --> 02:40:21.311
possible and in. Reaching our

02:40:21.378 --> 02:40:23.146
numerator recruitment. A goal

02:40:23.213 --> 02:40:27.217
so thought. Those can be to be

02:40:27.284 --> 02:40:27.718
that potential pools of

02:40:27.784 --> 02:40:32.990
applicants. Thanks. Okay other

02:40:33.056 --> 02:40:37.194
questions no all right of all I

02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:38.862
just first of all I just want

02:40:38.929 --> 02:40:39.463
to thank you so much for your

02:40:39.529 --> 02:40:41.231
work I and- really the role and

02:40:41.298 --> 02:40:43.333
I know that senator AHS been

02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:45.168
the- big champion in the

02:40:45.235 --> 02:40:47.104
capital for- for involving

02:40:47.170 --> 02:40:49.006
schools with the census and

02:40:49.072 --> 02:40:49.573
make sure that you have the

02:40:49.639 --> 02:40:51.208
resources to. Make that happen.

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:53.243
Is the one question I would

02:40:53.310 --> 02:40:56.913
have for you. Is that you know.

02:40:56.980 --> 02:40:59.316
Night editor for example Long

02:40:59.383 --> 02:41:01.051
Beach it's actually that they

02:41:01.118 --> 02:41:02.886
could committee's co chaired by

02:41:02.953 --> 02:41:03.520
both those mentioned by the LA

02:41:03.587 --> 02:41:05.422
you a step the- school district

02:41:05.489 --> 02:41:07.357
sorry Isaiah. Long Beach school

02:41:07.424 --> 02:41:09.326
district yeah and also the C.

02:41:09.393 --> 02:41:10.961
so it's a great example of

02:41:11.028 --> 02:41:12.896
collaboration. In terms of- I

02:41:12.963 --> 02:41:14.931
he just touch maybe about how

02:41:14.998 --> 02:41:17.100
your so you're what you're

02:41:17.167 --> 02:41:17.734
teaching the curriculum I know

02:41:17.801 --> 02:41:18.869
that's something that you know

02:41:18.935 --> 02:41:19.503
we've fashion states of Roth.

02:41:19.569 --> 02:41:21.271
Terms how the school district

02:41:21.338 --> 02:41:23.240
is interfacing with. Let's say

02:41:23.306 --> 02:41:25.275
some of the CBO stuff about

02:41:25.342 --> 02:41:27.377
language access and other types

02:41:27.444 --> 02:41:29.246
of things so. And it's great

02:41:29.312 --> 02:41:29.846
you were trying to come up

02:41:29.913 --> 02:41:31.314
people lots of different-

02:41:31.381 --> 02:41:31.982
actions right you know the kids

02:41:32.049 --> 02:41:33.383
going to come home and tell

02:41:33.450 --> 02:41:33.984
them about it right to go see

02:41:34.051 --> 02:41:35.318
something out there hopefully

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:37.487
you hear read something about

02:41:37.554 --> 02:41:39.222
it. So just in terms of you

02:41:39.289 --> 02:41:41.058
know obviously schools as

02:41:41.124 --> 02:41:41.691
centers of our communities they

02:41:41.758 --> 02:41:43.260
you interface a lot we have

02:41:43.326 --> 02:41:43.827
parent teacher organizations

02:41:43.894 --> 02:41:45.162
the idea of community

02:41:45.228 --> 02:41:46.997
organizations all around the

02:41:47.064 --> 02:41:47.631
school. How how's your C. high

02:41:47.697 --> 02:41:49.232
school districts- tapping into

02:41:49.299 --> 02:41:51.234
serve your networks of

02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:53.270
relationships that you have

02:41:53.336 --> 02:41:55.238
with- the surrounding

02:41:55.305 --> 02:41:56.973
communities around your school.

02:41:57.040 --> 02:41:59.176
And then- how that interfaces

02:41:59.242 --> 02:42:01.344
with- the sort of the various

02:42:01.411 --> 02:42:07.084
committees that- we've- heard

02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:11.121
from here today can you just.

02:42:11.188 --> 02:42:11.755
Talk about that and how to use

02:42:11.822 --> 02:42:13.156
it of course is that and how

02:42:13.223 --> 02:42:13.824
the students. Are you work with

02:42:13.890 --> 02:42:14.324
that perhaps the plugin

02:42:14.391 --> 02:42:14.791
students who might be

02:42:14.858 --> 02:42:17.461
interested. The one of the one

02:42:17.527 --> 02:42:19.563
of the first things we did when

02:42:19.629 --> 02:42:21.465
we did our convening was to

02:42:21.531 --> 02:42:23.100
invite the nonprofit partners.

02:42:23.166 --> 02:42:25.402
I have to say I think sometimes

02:42:25.469 --> 02:42:27.237
it's a real challenge. Of not

02:42:27.304 --> 02:42:29.372
because the non profits are not

02:42:29.439 --> 02:42:31.241
willing because they're they're

02:42:31.308 --> 02:42:33.243
they're ready they're- giving.

02:42:33.310 --> 02:42:35.378
Out sometimes it's really the

02:42:35.445 --> 02:42:39.116
education. Community that needs

02:42:39.182 --> 02:42:41.151
to figure out how how best to

02:42:41.218 --> 02:42:43.186
use it they may not have- a YA

02:42:43.253 --> 02:42:45.322
and infrastructure that's just

02:42:45.388 --> 02:42:47.157
not ready to pull them in. So

02:42:47.224 --> 02:42:49.292
that for us I think is one of

02:42:49.359 --> 02:42:51.328
the challenges. I and it is a

02:42:51.394 --> 02:42:53.263
it is certainly a challenging

02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:55.398
one that that we're continuing

02:42:55.465 --> 02:42:57.534
to work on. And to and to try

02:42:57.601 --> 02:42:59.636
to bring as many partners as we

02:42:59.703 --> 02:43:01.538
can add. To the schools. Are so

02:43:01.605 --> 02:43:03.607
that they so they can so that

02:43:03.673 --> 02:43:05.542
they can link I think we all

02:43:05.609 --> 02:43:07.277
recognize the importance. Of

02:43:07.344 --> 02:43:09.279
building communities and

02:43:09.346 --> 02:43:11.448
needing this in in the way that

02:43:11.515 --> 02:43:13.283
we can so that there's no- so

02:43:13.350 --> 02:43:15.619
that there's no repetition.

02:43:15.685 --> 02:43:17.521
Unnecessary repetition that

02:43:17.587 --> 02:43:19.422
we're not inventing reinventing

02:43:19.489 --> 02:43:21.191
the wheel every every which way

02:43:21.258 --> 02:43:23.426
but- but for us I think that

02:43:23.493 --> 02:43:25.562
use. That use a challenge and I

02:43:25.629 --> 02:43:27.464
think earlier we heard the Long

02:43:27.531 --> 02:43:29.466
Beach forces say the same thing

02:43:29.533 --> 02:43:31.568
it's sort of. Trying to figure

02:43:31.635 --> 02:43:35.338
out how best to break in and to

02:43:35.405 --> 02:43:37.340
and to become partners- so for

02:43:37.407 --> 02:43:41.211
so for us we certainly see

02:43:41.278 --> 02:43:41.778
that. Their appreciate your

02:43:41.845 --> 02:43:45.248
acknowledging also that.

02:43:45.315 --> 02:43:47.384
Forming partnerships and three

02:43:47.450 --> 02:43:47.984
of the infrastructure is not

02:43:48.051 --> 02:43:48.451
something just happens

02:43:48.518 --> 02:43:49.553
magically it takes time and

02:43:49.619 --> 02:43:51.388
effort and resources it's not

02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:51.922
something that you know

02:43:51.988 --> 02:43:53.623
oftentimes people talk like me

02:43:53.690 --> 02:43:55.392
Bates organizations like- you

02:43:55.458 --> 02:43:57.394
do this work can you. You know

02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:59.429
jun join our group. And they're

02:43:59.496 --> 02:44:01.198
like okay my calendars full of

02:44:01.264 --> 02:44:01.831
like I gotta get this group and

02:44:01.898 --> 02:44:03.400
I gotta do my real work right

02:44:03.466 --> 02:44:05.268
on the edge even get paid for

02:44:05.335 --> 02:44:05.869
baby I get paid for sometimes

02:44:05.936 --> 02:44:07.637
not. So appreciate recognizing

02:44:07.704 --> 02:44:11.708
that. We are actually very

02:44:11.775 --> 02:44:13.677
fortunate at LA unified school

02:44:13.743 --> 02:44:15.579
district to have very engaging

02:44:15.645 --> 02:44:17.514
robust partnerships with a lot

02:44:17.581 --> 02:44:19.316
of our community based

02:44:19.382 --> 02:44:21.318
organizations. It really began-

02:44:21.384 --> 02:44:23.486
couple years ago when we formed

02:44:23.553 --> 02:44:25.322
our we are one LA unified

02:44:25.388 --> 02:44:25.822
campaign standing with

02:44:25.889 --> 02:44:29.326
immigrant families. And through

02:44:29.392 --> 02:44:31.328
that campaign we have-

02:44:31.394 --> 02:44:33.630
interface would many immigrant-

02:44:33.697 --> 02:44:37.534
organizations chair lack of

02:44:37.601 --> 02:44:39.736
this and- and- the California

02:44:39.803 --> 02:44:41.638
community foundation has been a

02:44:41.705 --> 02:44:43.406
great supporter of our we are

02:44:43.473 --> 02:44:45.408
one LA unified campaign. So it

02:44:45.475 --> 02:44:46.109
feels like as we enter into our

02:44:46.176 --> 02:44:47.677
census work and we're

02:44:47.744 --> 02:44:49.746
transitioning into their are we

02:44:49.813 --> 02:44:51.514
are one make LA unified. Count

02:44:51.581 --> 02:44:53.850
campaign it seems almost like a

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:57.420
seamless transition we are

02:44:57.487 --> 02:44:59.422
engaging with most of the same

02:44:59.489 --> 02:45:01.424
organizations. In our senses-

02:45:01.491 --> 02:45:03.526
much of our partners who were

02:45:03.593 --> 02:45:04.160
from the previous panels we've

02:45:04.227 --> 02:45:05.762
had meanings and part of that

02:45:05.829 --> 02:45:07.731
as long. As well as our

02:45:07.797 --> 02:45:09.599
partnership with late goal- and

02:45:09.666 --> 02:45:13.670
L. unified we are- as part of

02:45:13.737 --> 02:45:14.304
the legal office looking into

02:45:14.371 --> 02:45:17.507
M. O. use would CBO's. And

02:45:17.574 --> 02:45:19.576
having them assist in our

02:45:19.643 --> 02:45:20.143
senses outreach efforts as

02:45:20.210 --> 02:45:23.680
well. And that is one of one of

02:45:23.747 --> 02:45:25.749
the points that we will be. Of

02:45:25.815 --> 02:45:31.454
leveraging continue to leverage.

02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:31.988
And I want to echo that as

02:45:32.055 --> 02:45:33.657
well- when I first attended the

02:45:33.723 --> 02:45:35.558
meeting several months ago and

02:45:35.625 --> 02:45:37.560
saw the partners that were in

02:45:37.627 --> 02:45:39.429
there from the CBO's. Those

02:45:39.496 --> 02:45:39.996
particular organizations are

02:45:40.063 --> 02:45:42.065
already in our school system so

02:45:42.132 --> 02:45:45.435
we are. Already in alignment

02:45:45.502 --> 02:45:47.637
with him and- issues again it's

02:45:47.704 --> 02:45:49.773
seamless so we are on board

02:45:49.839 --> 02:45:51.675
and- they attend some of our

02:45:51.741 --> 02:45:53.877
events and vice versa so we're

02:45:53.943 --> 02:45:54.444
working collaboratively with

02:45:54.511 --> 02:45:59.582
an- intestine. Okay well I

02:45:59.649 --> 02:46:00.183
think the question no. Once

02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:01.818
that so all right well thank

02:46:01.885 --> 02:46:02.385

02:46:15.832 --> 02:46:17.767
updates bowstring local efforts

02:46:17.834 --> 02:46:19.869

02:47:20.163 --> 02:47:21.664
California complete count since

02:47:21.731 --> 02:47:22.165
twenty twenty office we

02:47:22.232 --> 02:47:23.767
appreciate the ongoing

02:47:23.833 --> 02:47:25.769
collaboration and support of

02:47:25.835 --> 02:47:26.403
the legislature to ensure that

02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:27.904
California is ready to achieve

02:47:27.971 --> 02:47:29.939
our fair share of resources and

02:47:30.006 --> 02:47:31.674
representation. In the

02:47:31.741 --> 02:47:33.810
decennial census first of all I

02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:35.612
wanted to say how proud and

02:47:35.678 --> 02:47:37.680
amazed at the work of our

02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:39.816
partners- that you've just all

02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:41.951
heard about- the integration of

02:47:42.018 --> 02:47:43.686
counties and cities sectors

02:47:43.753 --> 02:47:45.755
schools community foundations

02:47:45.822 --> 02:47:49.626
of that or weaving together. To

02:47:49.692 --> 02:47:51.628
create this outrage coverage is

02:47:51.694 --> 02:47:53.797
what we need I came back in

02:47:53.863 --> 02:47:55.799
twenty seventeen hoping that we

02:47:55.865 --> 02:47:56.299
can harness the energy

02:47:56.366 --> 02:47:58.034
creativity and commitment of

02:47:58.101 --> 02:47:59.569
these partners across sectors

02:47:59.636 --> 02:48:01.938
and I'm so relieved that these

02:48:02.005 --> 02:48:03.573
committed partners have come

02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:05.809
together to get it done. I do

02:48:05.875 --> 02:48:07.644
want to give a little shout out

02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:09.746
for some early thought leaders

02:48:09.813 --> 02:48:11.648
Dorothea park retired from LA

02:48:11.714 --> 02:48:12.315
county and doctor John the bard

02:48:12.382 --> 02:48:13.850
of the California dancer

02:48:13.917 --> 02:48:15.718
project you guys have seen in

02:48:15.785 --> 02:48:17.854
the past- presentations talking

02:48:17.921 --> 02:48:19.656
about this LA regional table

02:48:19.722 --> 02:48:20.190
you know he and I started

02:48:20.256 --> 02:48:22.025
conversations back in twenty

02:48:22.091 --> 02:48:23.860
seventeen of January when like

02:48:23.927 --> 02:48:25.728
nobody was even talking about

02:48:25.795 --> 02:48:26.396
census and so he's kind of one

02:48:26.463 --> 02:48:27.997
of those quiet leaders that

02:48:28.064 --> 02:48:29.766
really kind of thought about

02:48:29.833 --> 02:48:30.433
how does this all work how do

02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:32.035
we make. The sort of complex

02:48:32.101 --> 02:48:34.003
thing going on he also have

02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:35.872
leadership within C. pan the

02:48:35.939 --> 02:48:37.740
census policy advocacy network

02:48:37.807 --> 02:48:39.676
who was instrumental in working

02:48:39.742 --> 02:48:41.678
with all of you on our funding.

02:48:41.744 --> 02:48:42.245
So I just want to see that

02:48:42.312 --> 02:48:43.780
these early folks planted seeds

02:48:43.847 --> 02:48:45.682
that have grown into a

02:48:45.748 --> 02:48:47.750
tremendous powerful movement so

02:48:47.817 --> 02:48:48.384
whether you started working on

02:48:48.451 --> 02:48:51.988
census in twenty seventeen or

02:48:52.055 --> 02:48:53.790
if you're just coming to the

02:48:53.857 --> 02:48:54.390
table today by watching or

02:48:54.457 --> 02:48:56.092
participating in this hearing.

02:48:56.159 --> 02:48:57.927
Please know that it it won't

02:48:57.994 --> 02:48:58.495
just take one village it's

02:48:58.561 --> 02:49:00.230
going to take all the ledges to

02:49:00.296 --> 02:49:01.898
get this done and again all

02:49:01.965 --> 02:49:03.933
efforts are welcome and all

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:05.735
efforts are needed. The

02:49:05.802 --> 02:49:06.302
partner's we've heard from

02:49:06.369 --> 02:49:08.037
today demonstrate why we're

02:49:08.104 --> 02:49:10.006
investing so heavily in our

02:49:10.073 --> 02:49:10.640
local ground game. Because they

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:14.110
know. Exactly where to invest

02:49:14.177 --> 02:49:16.212
and or in order to educate and

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:16.813
motivate the hardest to count

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:17.981
Californians. As twenty

02:49:18.047 --> 02:49:20.083
nineteen comes to end. Or as we

02:49:20.149 --> 02:49:22.151
start our fourth quarter full

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:24.020
court full court press. We're

02:49:24.087 --> 02:49:25.922
hearing up for January twenty

02:49:25.989 --> 02:49:27.857
twenty our office and are

02:49:27.924 --> 02:49:29.893
contracted partners are getting

02:49:29.959 --> 02:49:30.493
ready to make a shift of our

02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:31.928
outreach focus. From the

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:34.063
motivate pays to the activities

02:49:34.130 --> 02:49:35.999
and we're gonna strategically

02:49:36.065 --> 02:49:37.967
move target audience toward the

02:49:38.034 --> 02:49:39.969
action of actually completing.

02:49:40.036 --> 02:49:41.871
The questionnaire. However as I

02:49:41.938 --> 02:49:44.207
look at the weeks to come and

02:49:44.274 --> 02:49:46.042
comparator efforts in two

02:49:46.109 --> 02:49:48.077
thousand and two thousand ten.

02:49:48.144 --> 02:49:49.913
It is clear that we're facing

02:49:49.979 --> 02:49:50.480
barriers on two fronts and

02:49:50.547 --> 02:49:53.783
that's how I classify them. The

02:49:53.850 --> 02:49:54.384
berries are motivational. And

02:49:54.450 --> 02:49:55.952
their structural. When we

02:49:56.019 --> 02:49:58.087
overcome the motivational

02:49:58.154 --> 02:49:59.789
barriers it means that people

02:49:59.856 --> 02:50:00.323
will want to fill out the

02:50:00.390 --> 02:50:01.791
questionnaire to help their

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:02.392
families their neighbors their

02:50:02.458 --> 02:50:04.227
community. The little trust

02:50:04.294 --> 02:50:06.062
that their information is

02:50:06.129 --> 02:50:08.064
confidential. And the state's

02:50:08.131 --> 02:50:09.966
invested millions in overcoming

02:50:10.033 --> 02:50:11.968
these motivational bears. The

02:50:12.035 --> 02:50:13.870
structural barriers however.

02:50:13.937 --> 02:50:16.072
Are obstacles for how a person

02:50:16.139 --> 02:50:18.007
can participate in the sense

02:50:18.074 --> 02:50:18.675
that some summer panels touched

02:50:18.741 --> 02:50:20.043
on a little bit about that.

02:50:20.109 --> 02:50:21.844
These are operations and

02:50:21.911 --> 02:50:24.013
processes that are embedded in

02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:24.547
the federal government's

02:50:24.614 --> 02:50:26.082
administration of the census.

02:50:26.149 --> 02:50:28.017
The structural barriers Lee

02:50:28.084 --> 02:50:30.053
solely in the hands of the US

02:50:30.119 --> 02:50:31.788
census bureau. However

02:50:31.854 --> 02:50:33.890
California is a state as

02:50:33.957 --> 02:50:34.457
legislators as policy as

02:50:34.524 --> 02:50:36.225
partners. We need to be

02:50:36.292 --> 02:50:38.227
innovative and help mitigate

02:50:38.294 --> 02:50:40.163
the impact of the structural

02:50:40.229 --> 02:50:41.965
barriers. As the census our

02:50:42.031 --> 02:50:42.565
office role is to provide a

02:50:42.632 --> 02:50:44.233
bridge between the census

02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:46.302
bureau and our local partners

02:50:46.369 --> 02:50:47.904
on the ground. To facilitate

02:50:47.971 --> 02:50:49.872
communication information

02:50:49.939 --> 02:50:51.941
sharing and provide support and

02:50:52.008 --> 02:50:54.043
advocate for solutions that are

02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:54.644
innovative and meet the needs

02:50:54.711 --> 02:50:56.145
of our local jurisdictions.

02:50:56.212 --> 02:50:58.181
There are a number of

02:50:58.247 --> 02:50:58.781
structural barriers that our

02:50:58.848 --> 02:51:00.049
local partners have been

02:51:00.116 --> 02:51:01.951
identifying a bring forth to

02:51:02.018 --> 02:51:02.485
the state and asking for

02:51:02.552 --> 02:51:04.220
assistance. But I'm just going

02:51:04.287 --> 02:51:05.888
to touch on one we touch on

02:51:05.955 --> 02:51:06.556
others later in the queue in a-

02:51:06.623 --> 02:51:08.191
a structure where that if we

02:51:08.257 --> 02:51:11.961
don't help mitigate we put our

02:51:12.028 --> 02:51:12.528
count at risk. And that you

02:51:12.595 --> 02:51:15.932
guys have started talk about.

02:51:15.999 --> 02:51:16.399
The most immediate is

02:51:16.466 --> 02:51:16.966
recruitment of enumerators

02:51:17.033 --> 02:51:18.301
Harding university is and your

02:51:18.368 --> 02:51:18.935
laudable speak about those very

02:51:19.002 --> 02:51:19.969
real numbers that each and

02:51:20.036 --> 02:51:21.904
every. One of our jurisdictions

02:51:21.971 --> 02:51:23.906
needs with our unemployment

02:51:23.973 --> 02:51:26.109
rate being so low. The federal

02:51:26.175 --> 02:51:27.977
hiring process being so slow.

02:51:28.044 --> 02:51:29.879
And the lack of flexibility.

02:51:29.946 --> 02:51:32.115
And creativity about how we

02:51:32.181 --> 02:51:34.250
meet those hiring goals we are

02:51:34.317 --> 02:51:37.887
at a critical crossroads. Again

02:51:37.954 --> 02:51:38.521
we want to motivate those to be

02:51:38.588 --> 02:51:39.989
counted but if they're not a

02:51:40.056 --> 02:51:40.623
Newman- enough Newman is to

02:51:40.690 --> 02:51:42.291
knock on doors people don't

02:51:42.358 --> 02:51:44.293
self respond. After made may

02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:46.362
first hits then we risk all of

02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:48.031
those being missed. We are

02:51:48.097 --> 02:51:49.966
committed at the state- to

02:51:50.033 --> 02:51:52.035
partner with the census bureau

02:51:52.101 --> 02:51:52.702
a couple things that we've been

02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:54.203
doing to help drive recruitment

02:51:54.270 --> 02:51:56.205
we're doing job related posts

02:51:56.272 --> 02:51:57.907
on our social media- tool kits.

02:51:57.974 --> 02:52:00.043
Our high letting them in our

02:52:00.109 --> 02:52:00.677
partner newsletters our senses

02:52:00.743 --> 02:52:02.512
dot CA dot gov website includes

02:52:02.578 --> 02:52:04.180
information under new jobs

02:52:04.247 --> 02:52:06.315
resources all our social media

02:52:06.382 --> 02:52:08.251
channels are are pushing out

02:52:08.317 --> 02:52:09.986
the message we're finding ways

02:52:10.053 --> 02:52:10.553
to integrate with other out

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:12.455
reach works for key audiences

02:52:12.522 --> 02:52:14.290
to seniors were doing work with

02:52:14.357 --> 02:52:16.159
seniors. College students were

02:52:16.225 --> 02:52:16.826
working with all our higher ed

02:52:16.893 --> 02:52:18.361
folks and other groups are well

02:52:18.428 --> 02:52:20.196
positioned for census bureau

02:52:20.263 --> 02:52:22.198
employment positions. This also

02:52:22.265 --> 02:52:22.765
includes employed messaging

02:52:22.832 --> 02:52:24.500
with labor agency employment

02:52:24.567 --> 02:52:26.269
development department and

02:52:26.335 --> 02:52:26.803
other labor focus stages

02:52:26.869 --> 02:52:28.438
agencies and departments. For

02:52:28.504 --> 02:52:30.473
those reaching a possible play

02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:32.408
polite cal vet and apartments

02:52:32.475 --> 02:52:35.912
retirees and other adults. Also

02:52:35.978 --> 02:52:38.081
regardless if our partners are

02:52:38.147 --> 02:52:40.083
getting funding. To help with

02:52:40.149 --> 02:52:42.018
recruitment I am hopeful that

02:52:42.085 --> 02:52:42.685
they'll realize the urgent need

02:52:42.752 --> 02:52:46.389
to help. With this recruitment

02:52:46.456 --> 02:52:46.956
regardless of their getting

02:52:47.023 --> 02:52:50.426
funding. In closing whether the

02:52:50.493 --> 02:52:52.228
structural barrier. Or

02:52:52.295 --> 02:52:52.795
motivational barrier no one

02:52:52.862 --> 02:52:54.263
single group or organization

02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:55.998
can achieve a complete count on

02:52:56.065 --> 02:52:58.000
their own. Coordinated

02:52:58.067 --> 02:52:58.634
collaborative efforts will be

02:52:58.701 --> 02:53:00.136
critical to success. And we

02:53:00.203 --> 02:53:02.105
look forward to continuing down

02:53:02.171 --> 02:53:04.140
this path into our fourth

02:53:04.207 --> 02:53:06.109
quarter. To mix metaphors taken

02:53:06.175 --> 02:53:08.211
across the goal line. That with

02:53:08.277 --> 02:53:10.012
our partners philanthropy

02:53:10.079 --> 02:53:12.148
legislature the census bureau

02:53:12.215 --> 02:53:14.083
and our other stakeholders to

02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:18.087
find solutions. Thank you for

02:53:18.154 --> 02:53:18.688
this time in I'm a bill to the

02:53:18.755 --> 02:53:20.056
to answer additional cost.

02:53:20.123 --> 02:53:22.258
Thank you miss Carnegie our

02:53:22.325 --> 02:53:28.164
next miss those Connell. Thank

02:53:28.231 --> 02:53:30.366
you for the opportunity I

02:53:30.433 --> 02:53:32.235
wanted to thank everyone I'm

02:53:32.301 --> 02:53:34.070
sitting here today I just saw

02:53:34.137 --> 02:53:36.172
all of the efforts that are

02:53:36.239 --> 02:53:36.773
made for the recruitment again

02:53:36.839 --> 02:53:38.274
from the state level from the

02:53:38.341 --> 02:53:40.209
county level from this city

slide always show you just what

02:55:08.297 --> 02:55:08.865
we're doing we do have thirty

02:55:08.931 --> 02:55:10.433
offices that are located

02:55:10.499 --> 02:55:12.435
strategically in California and

02:55:12.501 --> 02:55:14.337
that's to support all of our

02:55:14.403 --> 02:55:14.904
numerators all of our field

02:55:14.971 --> 02:55:16.572
work. Again we have three

02:55:16.639 --> 02:55:18.441
offices in central California.

02:55:18.507 --> 02:55:20.409
We got ten in northern

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:22.245
California and we have about

02:55:22.311 --> 02:55:22.778
seventeen offices offices

02:55:22.845 --> 02:55:24.447
specifically in the southern

02:55:24.513 --> 02:55:26.482
California area. Because this

02:55:26.549 --> 02:55:28.584
meeting focused on Los Angeles

02:55:28.651 --> 02:55:30.620
county and Orange County just

02:55:30.686 --> 02:55:32.455
wanted to bring up some of the

02:55:32.521 --> 02:55:33.089
numbers for Los Angeles county

02:55:33.155 --> 02:55:36.659
about a- but more over a week

02:55:36.726 --> 02:55:38.494
ago we were at 38% so as of

02:55:38.561 --> 02:55:40.730
today and this is the updated

02:55:40.796 --> 02:55:42.298
number for today's forty one

02:55:42.365 --> 02:55:44.533
percent. This we put it

02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:45.101
together yesterday so as you

02:55:45.167 --> 02:55:48.237
can see. It is slowly moving

02:55:48.304 --> 02:55:50.306
upward where we need to be- the

02:55:50.373 --> 02:55:52.375
other things for Orange County

02:55:52.441 --> 02:55:54.610
it's over seventeen thousand a

02:55:54.677 --> 02:55:56.479
new. Recruits for that area

02:55:56.545 --> 02:55:58.347
right forty six point eight

02:55:58.414 --> 02:56:00.516
percent. So we're slowly moving

02:56:00.583 --> 02:56:02.251
up and again this flight was as

02:56:02.318 --> 02:56:02.919
yesterday at the numbers that I

02:56:02.985 --> 02:56:04.587
just spoke right now our what

02:56:04.654 --> 02:56:06.455
we're doing actually today. So

02:56:06.522 --> 02:56:10.359
we did look those up on. Where

02:56:10.426 --> 02:56:10.860
are progresses and we're

02:56:10.927 --> 02:56:14.397
removing. On the other. Slide

02:56:14.463 --> 02:56:14.964
that we're talking about is

02:56:15.031 --> 02:56:15.598
most people that's what's our

02:56:15.665 --> 02:56:16.499
language goal. And if using

02:56:16.565 --> 02:56:18.334
some of the committee based

02:56:18.401 --> 02:56:18.968
organizations a lot of them on

02:56:19.035 --> 02:56:20.636
the census bureau website. They

02:56:20.703 --> 02:56:24.307
use the- planning database. So

02:56:24.373 --> 02:56:26.309
again with the geography as we

02:56:26.375 --> 02:56:28.411
spoke about- each track with at

02:56:28.477 --> 02:56:28.978
least 5% of the population

02:56:29.045 --> 02:56:30.546
primaries begin on English

02:56:30.613 --> 02:56:32.548
language. And again that's

02:56:32.615 --> 02:56:33.115
according to the planning

02:56:33.182 --> 02:56:34.517
database they created a

02:56:34.583 --> 02:56:38.254
language recruiting goal for-

02:56:38.321 --> 02:56:38.754
the census bureau's non

02:56:38.821 --> 02:56:40.289
response follow up operation.

02:56:40.356 --> 02:56:40.923
So the language recruiting on

02:56:40.990 --> 02:56:42.692
these tracks is equal to the

02:56:42.758 --> 02:56:44.360
percentage of population

02:56:44.427 --> 02:56:44.927
speaking that language it

02:56:44.994 --> 02:56:46.629
multiplied by the non response

02:56:46.696 --> 02:56:48.331
follow up recruiting goal or

02:56:48.397 --> 02:56:50.266
one or whichever is greater.

02:56:50.333 --> 02:56:52.335
And overall we have goals for

02:56:52.401 --> 02:56:52.802
thirty eight different

02:56:52.868 --> 02:56:54.503
languages and we have over a

02:56:54.570 --> 02:56:55.104
hundred and ten thousand nine

02:56:55.171 --> 02:56:56.372
hundred thirty. Total

02:56:56.439 --> 02:56:56.906
applicants with a language

02:56:56.973 --> 02:57:00.643
skill. Next labor gonna talk

02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:02.545
about is our recruiting

02:57:02.611 --> 02:57:04.380

Private companies companies we

02:57:22.732 --> 02:57:24.767

02:57:24.834 --> 02:57:26.469

with companies and others to

02:57:32.608 --> 02:57:34.276

03:01:12.695 --> 03:01:16.498
short time period is- if you

03:01:16.565 --> 03:01:18.634
could go back to that- that's

03:01:18.701 --> 03:01:19.235
one question and then for both

03:01:19.301 --> 03:01:24.540
of you is. How would you gauge.

03:01:24.607 --> 03:01:28.577
A more successful campaign to

03:01:28.644 --> 03:01:30.813
do the census all we know were

03:01:30.879 --> 03:01:32.848
hard to count and in our part

03:01:32.915 --> 03:01:34.717
of in California overall but

03:01:34.783 --> 03:01:38.687
especially in this area- how

03:01:38.754 --> 03:01:40.789
would you gauge that we did

03:01:40.856 --> 03:01:44.593
better we did where we should I

03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:45.227
know were. You know looking for

03:01:45.294 --> 03:01:46.929
a 100% but- how would you how

03:01:46.996 --> 03:01:48.897
would you gauge it is they're-

03:01:48.964 --> 03:01:51.000
taking twenty ten and adding a

03:01:51.066 --> 03:01:54.770
certain percentage or- what we

03:01:54.837 --> 03:01:58.674
shooting for here. So as far as

03:01:58.741 --> 03:02:00.676
numbers- again they take in

03:02:00.743 --> 03:02:02.778
consideration of the workload

03:02:02.845 --> 03:02:03.345
to the goals are established

03:02:03.412 --> 03:02:04.813
are based on the work load

03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:06.682
based on if the county has the

03:02:06.749 --> 03:02:08.684
area census office located or

03:02:08.751 --> 03:02:12.621
not- and also offer refusal

03:02:12.688 --> 03:02:13.222
rates that we've experienced

03:02:13.289 --> 03:02:15.057
and does offer refusal rates

03:02:15.124 --> 03:02:16.992
are very between counties in

03:02:17.059 --> 03:02:19.061
offices and that's kind of one

03:02:19.128 --> 03:02:20.963
of our- biggest challenges

03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:22.631
right now because of the

03:02:22.698 --> 03:02:23.198
unemployment rate. And then

03:02:23.265 --> 03:02:26.635
also kind of. It's a different.

03:02:26.702 --> 03:02:28.737
Different environments some

03:02:28.804 --> 03:02:29.338
some of the other people are

03:02:29.405 --> 03:02:30.739
not interested in- at that

03:02:30.806 --> 03:02:32.741
point that's where we need a

03:02:32.808 --> 03:02:33.309
selling point it's going to

03:02:33.375 --> 03:02:34.943
work a lot better one on one

03:02:35.010 --> 03:02:36.612
speaking to people or having

03:02:36.679 --> 03:02:38.614
the trusted voices. Share those

03:02:38.681 --> 03:02:39.181
messages because if not the

03:02:39.248 --> 03:02:40.816
kind of just gonna scroll to

03:02:40.883 --> 03:02:42.685
the job. And looked as

03:02:42.751 --> 03:02:43.285
interested but yes those goals

03:02:43.352 --> 03:02:46.722
are met are based on- again

03:02:46.789 --> 03:02:48.991
the- some are not implement

03:02:49.058 --> 03:02:50.626
rates were there the county

03:02:50.693 --> 03:02:52.628
contains- officer not office.

03:02:52.695 --> 03:02:54.897
Refusal rate also that we've

03:02:54.963 --> 03:02:55.431
experienced in the hiring

03:02:55.497 --> 03:03:00.836
process. Alright some gonna

03:03:00.903 --> 03:03:02.771
nerd out on you and you can

03:03:02.838 --> 03:03:04.773
just stop me on that so. I mean

03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:05.407
there are many ways we're doing

03:03:05.474 --> 03:03:07.042
a lot of valuation because I

03:03:07.109 --> 03:03:08.744
know centers can ask about that

03:03:08.811 --> 03:03:09.345
we're looking at a valuation

03:03:09.411 --> 03:03:12.614
for- at the macro level of how

03:03:12.681 --> 03:03:13.115
we're moving. You know

03:03:13.182 --> 03:03:14.983
attitudes but really the stuff

03:03:15.050 --> 03:03:15.584
that you're all going to look

03:03:15.651 --> 03:03:17.119
at is response rates. So if you

03:03:17.186 --> 03:03:19.021
really look at self response

03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:20.823
rates verses when they do nor

03:03:20.889 --> 03:03:22.891
for the knocking on doors were

03:03:22.958 --> 03:03:24.626
they get the hundred percent.

03:03:24.693 --> 03:03:26.762
Looking at how the US census

03:03:26.829 --> 03:03:27.396
bureau nationally says they're

03:03:27.463 --> 03:03:29.098
gonna target sixty point five.

03:03:29.164 --> 03:03:30.833
Like they're expecting sixty

03:03:30.899 --> 03:03:33.001
point five. Percent of

03:03:33.068 --> 03:03:34.770
households to self respond

03:03:34.837 --> 03:03:36.805
meeting they do it online they

03:03:36.872 --> 03:03:37.406
do on the phone what have you

03:03:37.473 --> 03:03:39.007
that. Before Mar- may first

03:03:39.074 --> 03:03:42.878
rate. So for me I don't know

03:03:42.945 --> 03:03:43.512
how far that is because we are

03:03:43.579 --> 03:03:45.247
facing a lot of unprecedented.

03:03:45.314 --> 03:03:47.116
Issues so what I would look at

03:03:47.182 --> 03:03:49.118
is I break it down into time

03:03:49.184 --> 03:03:50.953
periods because we're we're

03:03:51.019 --> 03:03:52.855
doing such data intensive work

03:03:52.921 --> 03:03:53.455
with our partners. And I would

03:03:53.522 --> 03:03:55.124
look at you obviously have to

03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:56.725
look at census tracts geography

03:03:56.792 --> 03:03:57.259
geographically that tower

03:03:57.326 --> 03:04:00.729
tracking it. We're looking at

03:04:00.796 --> 03:04:02.831
twenty ten census. Tract rates

03:04:02.898 --> 03:04:04.933
for those dates so let's just

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.102
take- a the census tract or

03:04:07.169 --> 03:04:09.004
here in Long Beach this call it

03:04:09.071 --> 03:04:10.939
zero zero dash one. We're gonna

03:04:11.006 --> 03:04:12.741
look at on April first just

03:04:12.808 --> 03:04:14.743
take a date where were they in

03:04:14.810 --> 03:04:15.377
twenty ten. In terms of their

03:04:15.444 --> 03:04:17.112
response rate. And where they

03:04:17.179 --> 03:04:19.214
now in twenty twenty and we're

03:04:19.281 --> 03:04:22.751
doing that across the state

03:04:22.818 --> 03:04:23.385
looking at comparing those so

03:04:23.452 --> 03:04:25.287
we can get sort of a semi real

03:04:25.354 --> 03:04:28.757
time look at dashboard wise.

03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:29.391
And how we're doing. So that's

03:04:29.458 --> 03:04:31.126
just one Mike when you're

03:04:31.193 --> 03:04:32.761
talking about response rates

03:04:32.828 --> 03:04:34.863
now in terms of metrics. I mean

03:04:34.930 --> 03:04:36.932
how many questions assistance

03:04:36.999 --> 03:04:38.901
centers DB establish. How many

03:04:38.967 --> 03:04:40.803
of. How much usage to begin how

03:04:40.869 --> 03:04:41.403
may touches that we get there

03:04:41.470 --> 03:04:43.138
because with questioner since

03:04:43.205 --> 03:04:45.140
centers we're hoping that you

03:04:45.207 --> 03:04:48.744
know there are a 100% in terms

03:04:48.811 --> 03:04:49.311
of completion verses like

03:04:49.378 --> 03:04:51.146
somebody just. Taking something

03:04:51.213 --> 03:04:55.017
Allen vent. We can look at.

03:04:55.083 --> 03:04:58.754
Schools using creek. For having

03:04:58.821 --> 03:05:00.889
it's so important and school

03:05:00.956 --> 03:05:01.490
takes a long time to get that

03:05:01.557 --> 03:05:01.990
moving and to change the

03:05:02.057 --> 03:05:02.558
curriculum and for the first

03:05:02.624 --> 03:05:03.192
time we have curriculum that's

03:05:03.258 --> 03:05:04.993
actually made by teachers and

03:05:05.060 --> 03:05:05.561
accepted for the California

03:05:05.627 --> 03:05:07.062
standards also looking at

03:05:07.129 --> 03:05:09.198
social media I mean that's the

03:05:09.264 --> 03:05:11.033
easiest hits where would how

03:05:11.099 --> 03:05:12.835
many people are engaging how

03:05:12.901 --> 03:05:14.837
many people are commenting. So

03:05:14.903 --> 03:05:16.805
those are just some of the

03:05:16.872 --> 03:05:17.439
things M. you can get down to

03:05:17.506 --> 03:05:19.007
the census track to see if were

03:05:19.074 --> 03:05:20.909
the centrist tractors are point

03:05:20.976 --> 03:05:24.746
one is at 11% percent response

03:05:24.813 --> 03:05:26.849
rate on April first and they

03:05:26.915 --> 03:05:29.017
were at you know 28% last time

03:05:29.084 --> 03:05:31.053
around we can track it for

03:05:31.119 --> 03:05:32.754
maybe a couple days to see if

03:05:32.821 --> 03:05:34.756
because of online and then how

03:05:34.823 --> 03:05:35.357
to read read to see how to

03:05:35.424 --> 03:05:37.125
redeploy a Long Beach forward

03:05:37.192 --> 03:05:39.127
to say Hey look at the census

03:05:39.194 --> 03:05:41.230
tracks. Go do an event set up a

03:05:41.296 --> 03:05:43.232
table you know go to whatever

03:05:43.298 --> 03:05:45.234
you that the minister that's

03:05:45.300 --> 03:05:46.869
there have them deploy

03:05:46.935 --> 03:05:49.004
immediately and then see if

03:05:49.071 --> 03:05:50.839
that's going to change it so

03:05:50.906 --> 03:05:53.308
that was different about this

03:05:53.375 --> 03:05:53.942
time our hours are getting real

03:05:54.009 --> 03:05:56.979
to if you thank- but at the end

03:05:57.045 --> 03:05:59.214
of you know fifteenth we'll get

03:05:59.281 --> 03:06:02.751
a snapshot look at where

03:06:02.818 --> 03:06:03.385
response rates are and then the

03:06:03.452 --> 03:06:05.087
this group has to make up. And

03:06:05.153 --> 03:06:08.824
to all those you know only get

03:06:08.891 --> 03:06:11.293
50% they could not on fifth.

03:06:11.360 --> 03:06:11.894
Sent more possible to get that

03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:16.899
people can. In center pan.

03:06:16.965 --> 03:06:19.334
Thank you M. that I appreciate

03:06:19.401 --> 03:06:22.938
the challenges of especially in

03:06:23.005 --> 03:06:23.505
a good economy which we do

03:06:23.572 --> 03:06:25.240
like- and I would point out

03:06:25.307 --> 03:06:29.044
that actually he. That de

03:06:29.111 --> 03:06:30.946
should California economy I.

03:06:31.013 --> 03:06:31.613
she's been consistently growing

03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:33.282
faster than the rest of the

03:06:33.348 --> 03:06:37.019
country for many years- and so

03:06:37.085 --> 03:06:37.586
I think it's testament to

03:06:37.653 --> 03:06:39.121
California policies and

03:06:39.187 --> 03:06:41.156
economic growth but that's

03:06:41.223 --> 03:06:44.927
mental side comment. So the

03:06:44.993 --> 03:06:45.594
question now I want to cut back

03:06:45.661 --> 03:06:47.195
the nation right. Well it's

03:06:47.262 --> 03:06:49.164
also fairly directly straits

03:06:49.231 --> 03:06:51.266
right okay I'm not going there-

03:06:51.333 --> 03:06:53.302
the so the question I have to

03:06:53.368 --> 03:06:55.470
ask for you though is that so

03:06:55.537 --> 03:06:57.139
I've now I know you're in

03:06:57.205 --> 03:06:57.773
southern California I'm up in

03:06:57.839 --> 03:06:59.341
Sacramento and I've been trying

03:06:59.408 --> 03:07:01.276
to get people to talk about-

03:07:01.343 --> 03:07:05.113
working for the census to do

03:07:05.180 --> 03:07:06.882
numeration and I appreciate-

03:07:06.949 --> 03:07:08.884
the- discussion about. That's a

03:07:08.951 --> 03:07:09.451
structural issues will have

03:07:09.518 --> 03:07:11.253
enough enumerators were not

03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:11.887
going to be able to get to as

03:07:11.954 --> 03:07:14.890
many people- the thing is some

03:07:14.957 --> 03:07:16.992
the feedback I get is well

03:07:17.059 --> 03:07:19.027
earlier on was is that it took

03:07:19.094 --> 03:07:19.628
a long time for them to even

03:07:19.695 --> 03:07:21.029
hear D. will hear anything.

03:07:21.096 --> 03:07:22.864
Right so the plan application

03:07:22.931 --> 03:07:23.465
they just don't hear anything

03:07:23.532 --> 03:07:25.367
and- then there are you know

03:07:25.434 --> 03:07:26.868
they start losing interest in

03:07:26.935 --> 03:07:27.436
of course looking for other

03:07:27.502 --> 03:07:29.271
jobs and so forth so. Hopefully

03:07:29.338 --> 03:07:31.039
as we're getting closer to

03:07:31.106 --> 03:07:31.673
crunch time that gap in time

03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:33.308
between city an application and

03:07:33.375 --> 03:07:35.210
hearing something is closed and

03:07:35.277 --> 03:07:38.880
isn't as more instantaneous-

03:07:38.947 --> 03:07:39.514
the other thing though I also

03:07:39.581 --> 03:07:41.450
here's because we want we have

03:07:41.516 --> 03:07:43.218
a diverse state and we want a

03:07:43.285 --> 03:07:47.055
diverse set of enumerators- for

03:07:47.122 --> 03:07:48.991
example in forty communities of

03:07:49.057 --> 03:07:49.491
color. We have higher

03:07:49.558 --> 03:07:51.193
percentages of people who've

03:07:51.259 --> 03:07:53.295
had a history of conservation

03:07:53.362 --> 03:07:57.199
no are the record. And to what

03:07:57.265 --> 03:07:57.799
degree that a barrier to them

03:07:57.866 --> 03:07:59.234
working for the census right

03:07:59.301 --> 03:07:59.835
they they want they're looking

03:07:59.901 --> 03:08:01.236
for work they want to do

03:08:01.303 --> 03:08:03.305
something. Maybe can speak to

03:08:03.372 --> 03:08:05.374
that- my guess is that you

03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:07.376
probably not carried with those

03:08:07.442 --> 03:08:11.113
of documentation. From me but

03:08:11.179 --> 03:08:11.647
that's another but the two

03:08:11.713 --> 03:08:12.180
wives were taking out big

03:08:12.247 --> 03:08:13.382
chunks large chunks of people

03:08:13.448 --> 03:08:15.250
out of the pool. So I guess one

03:08:15.317 --> 03:08:17.252
of the things that went that

03:08:17.319 --> 03:08:19.054
maybe clarity is that so- how

03:08:19.121 --> 03:08:21.289
who can apply you know who who

03:08:21.356 --> 03:08:23.125
who who can be employed by the

03:08:23.191 --> 03:08:25.227
census to do this work I mean-

03:08:25.293 --> 03:08:27.262
it's sometimes not clear and I

03:08:27.329 --> 03:08:27.863
think there's a lot of stuff

03:08:27.929 --> 03:08:29.364
going around the community

03:08:29.431 --> 03:08:33.268
about that- and so people.

03:08:33.335 --> 03:08:33.869
Don't even wanna try is there

03:08:33.935 --> 03:08:35.370
for you know they think they

03:08:35.437 --> 03:08:41.309
won't Shotton. They're not so.

03:08:41.376 --> 03:08:45.313
I think that. You can clarify a

03:08:45.380 --> 03:08:45.881
not next to sheeting detail

03:08:45.947 --> 03:08:46.982
given factor hearing comprise

03:08:47.049 --> 03:08:47.516
more writing but perhaps a

03:08:47.582 --> 03:08:48.984
broad stroke as to. Who really

03:08:49.051 --> 03:08:49.551
realistically has a decent

03:08:49.618 --> 03:08:50.152
chance of getting a job with

03:08:50.218 --> 03:08:51.486
the senses of the take the time

03:08:51.553 --> 03:08:51.953
and effort of actually

03:08:52.020 --> 03:08:55.023
submitting an application.

03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:55.691
Great so the first thing is who

03:08:55.757 --> 03:08:57.225
can apply everyone can apply it

03:08:57.292 --> 03:08:58.994
but yes there are some factors

03:08:59.061 --> 03:09:01.229
that may be. Made not make us

03:09:01.296 --> 03:09:03.198
your filter down to a

03:09:03.265 --> 03:09:03.832
successful employee what does

03:09:03.899 --> 03:09:05.467
that look like when you apply

03:09:05.534 --> 03:09:07.436
online we don't have background

03:09:07.502 --> 03:09:09.204
questions an initial

03:09:09.271 --> 03:09:11.139
application. So those. Issues

03:09:11.206 --> 03:09:13.108
are handled on a case by case

03:09:13.175 --> 03:09:13.675
basis so say somebody has

03:09:13.742 --> 03:09:15.343
something other can become a

03:09:15.410 --> 03:09:15.944
criminal background we can't

03:09:16.011 --> 03:09:17.379
say this offense or this

03:09:17.446 --> 03:09:19.281
doesn't they take a lot of

03:09:19.347 --> 03:09:21.183
factors into consideration.

03:09:21.249 --> 03:09:21.850
Which is to be the time period

03:09:21.917 --> 03:09:23.385
of what should happen to the

03:09:23.452 --> 03:09:25.187
extent of whatever the- you

03:09:25.253 --> 03:09:27.255
know what the issue was. So

03:09:27.322 --> 03:09:29.257
those are handled by a case by

03:09:29.324 --> 03:09:31.359
case basis so again everyone

03:09:31.426 --> 03:09:33.361
can apply when they're hired.

03:09:33.428 --> 03:09:35.330
The national form that'll

03:09:35.397 --> 03:09:37.232
probably bring is the

03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:37.733
declaration for federal

03:09:37.799 --> 03:09:38.200
employment and so the

03:09:38.266 --> 03:09:39.301
declaration for federal

03:09:39.367 --> 03:09:41.169
employment is they do have to

03:09:41.236 --> 03:09:43.171
disclose. That information and

03:09:43.238 --> 03:09:43.705
if there's something that

03:09:43.772 --> 03:09:45.574
warrants additional information

03:09:45.640 --> 03:09:47.576
this time around they are given

03:09:47.642 --> 03:09:49.678
up about sixty days to respond

03:09:49.745 --> 03:09:51.480
to that okay let me let me push

03:09:51.546 --> 03:09:53.181
back a little bit on this I

03:09:53.248 --> 03:09:53.749
appreciate you saying well

03:09:53.815 --> 03:09:55.350
everybody can fly by the way.

03:09:55.417 --> 03:09:57.319
That could undocumented people

03:09:57.385 --> 03:09:59.354
it includes and I'm well. I'm

03:09:59.421 --> 03:10:01.556
just. Hello right yeah they can

03:10:01.623 --> 03:10:03.425
apply but they may not be

03:10:03.492 --> 03:10:05.227
eligible now they- know about a

03:10:05.293 --> 03:10:05.861
meter I mean the things he is

03:10:05.927 --> 03:10:07.162
able to be applied but for

03:10:07.229 --> 03:10:07.596
example they don't

03:10:07.662 --> 03:10:09.231
realistically have a chance of.

03:10:09.297 --> 03:10:11.166
Getting in like they can

03:10:11.233 --> 03:10:11.733
provide a social security

03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:13.368
number and really the answer is

03:10:13.435 --> 03:10:17.105
no they shouldn't. Right so I'd

03:10:17.172 --> 03:10:17.706
so I guess and then I get the

03:10:17.773 --> 03:10:23.245
idea that. Case by case. Basis

03:10:23.311 --> 03:10:23.745
but the problem is. The

03:10:23.812 --> 03:10:25.147
feedback I'm getting is that.

03:10:25.213 --> 03:10:27.415
They realize there isn't like

03:10:27.482 --> 03:10:29.117
maybe sharp lines. Problem

03:10:29.184 --> 03:10:29.651
probably the Thursday. The

03:10:29.718 --> 03:10:30.285
thirtieth but some guidance is

03:10:30.352 --> 03:10:31.353
helpful because I think there

03:10:31.419 --> 03:10:31.987
are people who are said well I

03:10:32.053 --> 03:10:33.221
don't want to. Bother doing

03:10:33.288 --> 03:10:35.257
this because I don't think I

03:10:35.323 --> 03:10:37.292
have much of a chance and I can

03:10:37.359 --> 03:10:37.759
go and tell them well

03:10:37.826 --> 03:10:39.161
everybody's your of life but-

03:10:39.227 --> 03:10:41.263
you know people talk to each

03:10:41.329 --> 03:10:41.863
other and community right I'm

03:10:41.930 --> 03:10:43.532
trying to be a truck. If I'm

03:10:43.598 --> 03:10:45.133
going to trust the messenger I

03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:45.767
got to be communicate to people

03:10:45.834 --> 03:10:47.269
about realistically. You know

03:10:47.335 --> 03:10:49.571
if you got these offenses you

03:10:49.638 --> 03:10:51.373
should definitely so go because

03:10:51.439 --> 03:10:53.241
there's a good chance they'll

03:10:53.308 --> 03:10:55.210
still hire you if. You're kind

03:10:55.277 --> 03:10:55.811
of got involved in something

03:10:55.877 --> 03:10:57.479
let's say you're his Vidak you

03:10:57.546 --> 03:10:59.281
know you got felony probably

03:10:59.347 --> 03:11:01.249
not. You know because people

03:11:01.316 --> 03:11:01.883
don't want you knocking on the

03:11:01.950 --> 03:11:03.485
door so I mean I think. Some

03:11:03.552 --> 03:11:05.353
clear guidance. May actually

03:11:05.420 --> 03:11:09.224
help to try to communicate this

03:11:09.291 --> 03:11:09.825
is back to trusted messenger

03:11:09.891 --> 03:11:11.526
issues right. Questions can I

03:11:11.593 --> 03:11:13.428
be a trusted messenger I just

03:11:13.495 --> 03:11:15.130
go and say everybody can apply

03:11:15.197 --> 03:11:17.232
I'm- I think my trusted part

03:11:17.299 --> 03:11:17.833
starts going down because I'm

03:11:17.899 --> 03:11:21.503
not being. Realistic and direct

03:11:21.570 --> 03:11:22.070
with them. And that's what I

03:11:22.137 --> 03:11:25.407
kind of. They realize that in

03:11:25.473 --> 03:11:26.041
Pratt C. official had you can't

03:11:26.107 --> 03:11:27.242
get but I mean some. That's

03:11:27.309 --> 03:11:29.377
going to be important to be

03:11:29.444 --> 03:11:31.213
able to communicate to people

03:11:31.279 --> 03:11:31.813
M. vertically communities in

03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:33.448
three communities wanna get

03:11:33.515 --> 03:11:35.584
numerators from because they'll

03:11:35.650 --> 03:11:36.051
be best at regionals

03:11:36.117 --> 03:11:37.485
communities what kind of

03:11:37.552 --> 03:11:39.621
direction we can give them so

03:11:39.688 --> 03:11:41.456
is there getting the word out

03:11:41.523 --> 03:11:43.291
that they can give people. The

03:11:43.358 --> 03:11:45.627
straight answer so that they

03:11:45.694 --> 03:11:47.362
can still remain trusted. Right

03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:49.297
and does it our eligibility

03:11:49.364 --> 03:11:51.233
questions that they're not

03:11:51.299 --> 03:11:51.867
getting any finite answers for

03:11:51.933 --> 03:11:53.635
it because again those are all

03:11:53.702 --> 03:11:55.470
reviewed on a case by case

03:11:55.537 --> 03:11:57.339
basis because there's so many

03:11:57.405 --> 03:11:59.241
factors to those. But yes

03:11:59.307 --> 03:11:59.708
normally I would use a

03:11:59.774 --> 03:12:01.443
declaration for federal

03:12:01.509 --> 03:12:03.378
employment as a guide I anyone

03:12:03.445 --> 03:12:04.012
can Google that and it'll ask

03:12:04.079 --> 03:12:05.580
background questions. As far

03:12:05.647 --> 03:12:07.616
as- if you're you're on

03:12:07.682 --> 03:12:09.351
probation they go back- five

03:12:09.417 --> 03:12:11.519
years- there's one question go

03:12:11.586 --> 03:12:13.221
seven years so that's the base

03:12:13.288 --> 03:12:13.688
line that the federal

03:12:13.755 --> 03:12:17.292
government uses. For jobs so if

03:12:17.359 --> 03:12:17.926
you're giving that information

03:12:17.993 --> 03:12:19.661
I would direct them to the

03:12:19.728 --> 03:12:21.429
declaration for federal

03:12:21.496 --> 03:12:22.030
employment- that's available

03:12:22.097 --> 03:12:23.632
online that's an office of

03:12:23.698 --> 03:12:25.433
personnel management form that

03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:27.335
this in in this is that also

03:12:27.402 --> 03:12:29.371
available I mean is the you

03:12:29.437 --> 03:12:31.306
put. That aside from having to

03:12:31.373 --> 03:12:33.375
only go find- M. B. is that

03:12:33.441 --> 03:12:34.042
something that's on this it's

03:12:34.109 --> 03:12:35.443
on the census bureau of

03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:37.245
personal website which is since

03:12:37.312 --> 03:12:39.247
the start garbage hiring

03:12:39.314 --> 03:12:39.781
documents. So it's part a

03:12:39.848 --> 03:12:41.383
hiring document yes for the

03:12:41.449 --> 03:12:41.950
hiring document because yes

03:12:42.017 --> 03:12:43.718
does questions in those things

03:12:43.785 --> 03:12:44.252
will come into play at the

03:12:44.319 --> 03:12:45.687
point of hiring when you first

03:12:45.754 --> 03:12:47.589
apply those questions are not.

03:12:47.656 --> 03:12:49.524
On the initial application so

03:12:49.591 --> 03:12:51.326
it does happen at the point of

03:12:51.393 --> 03:12:53.361
higher now there's some people

03:12:53.428 --> 03:12:54.029
that you may talk to maybe they

03:12:54.095 --> 03:12:55.463
had something that happened

03:12:55.530 --> 03:12:56.064
long time ago or were in when

03:12:56.131 --> 03:12:59.234
they were younger. And again.

03:12:59.301 --> 03:12:59.834
Our message should be in the

03:12:59.901 --> 03:13:01.236
community based organizations

03:13:01.303 --> 03:13:03.338
to help them complete that

03:13:03.405 --> 03:13:03.905
information so if there's

03:13:03.972 --> 03:13:05.607
feedback that's required maybe

03:13:05.674 --> 03:13:07.242
those coming based

03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.876
organizations can. Help them

03:13:07.943 --> 03:13:09.444
complete the letter help them

03:13:09.511 --> 03:13:10.078
clear up anything there's a lot

03:13:10.145 --> 03:13:11.613
of issues sometimes it's around

03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:13.515
this information want to clear

03:13:13.581 --> 03:13:15.517
that up as well. So I think the

03:13:15.583 --> 03:13:17.352
follow up and again the great

03:13:17.419 --> 03:13:17.953
job that the committee based

03:13:18.019 --> 03:13:19.587
organizations are doing it will

03:13:19.654 --> 03:13:21.456
help people but yes. The normal

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:23.358
guide that most federal

03:13:23.425 --> 03:13:23.825
agencies use is that

03:13:23.892 --> 03:13:25.460
declaration for federal

03:13:25.527 --> 03:13:27.262
employment it's on the census

03:13:27.329 --> 03:13:27.862
dot gov website under hiring

03:13:27.929 --> 03:13:31.266
documents. And I'm anyone can

03:13:31.333 --> 03:13:31.900
look Google the declaration for

03:13:31.967 --> 03:13:33.802
federal employment that a lot

03:13:33.868 --> 03:13:35.503
these give you the background

03:13:35.570 --> 03:13:39.374
questions that you're subject.

03:13:39.441 --> 03:13:39.975
To so that you can be prepared

03:13:40.041 --> 03:13:47.349
for them. Okay thank you. The

03:13:47.415 --> 03:13:47.949
seven member Berman. Thank you

03:13:48.016 --> 03:13:48.550
very much to. Hopefully quick

03:13:48.616 --> 03:13:49.551
questions the first is. So we-

03:13:49.617 --> 03:13:50.185
had kind of macro level. Data

03:13:50.251 --> 03:13:53.655
on- the percent of applicants

03:13:53.722 --> 03:13:55.357
that we have so far and what

03:13:55.423 --> 03:13:57.258
the goals are. Is there any

03:13:57.325 --> 03:13:57.859
kind of more micro level data

03:13:57.926 --> 03:13:59.794
in terms of in trying to. Find

03:13:59.861 --> 03:14:01.730
bilingual speakers in certain

03:14:01.796 --> 03:14:03.698
languages and whether or not

03:14:03.765 --> 03:14:05.700
we're falling short- in certain

03:14:05.767 --> 03:14:07.702
communities on. On some of the

03:14:07.769 --> 03:14:09.671
more specific skill sets that

03:14:09.738 --> 03:14:11.606
were trying to. You know get

03:14:11.673 --> 03:14:13.608
with with folks that are

03:14:13.675 --> 03:14:17.379
applying to be enumerators.

03:14:17.445 --> 03:14:17.912
That's the first question

03:14:17.979 --> 03:14:18.546
second questions unrelated toss

03:14:18.613 --> 03:14:21.483
up there for now. So the

03:14:21.549 --> 03:14:22.083
language gold we do have our

03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:25.487
language gold sad to- for the

03:14:25.553 --> 03:14:26.087
most part we've been meeting

03:14:26.154 --> 03:14:27.756
those and I can go back to see

03:14:27.822 --> 03:14:29.591
if we can share those at least

03:14:29.657 --> 03:14:30.225
most of the language goals were

03:14:30.291 --> 03:14:31.793
we've said we're at a hundred

03:14:31.860 --> 03:14:33.628
percent. Okay are meeting our

03:14:33.695 --> 03:14:34.229
language goals Scott good to

03:14:34.295 --> 03:14:35.830
know- in the same question as

03:14:35.897 --> 03:14:37.632
it was kind of misinformation

03:14:37.699 --> 03:14:39.434
and disinformation which has

03:14:39.501 --> 03:14:41.603
been a huge concern of mine- on

03:14:41.669 --> 03:14:43.638
the on the election front but

03:14:43.705 --> 03:14:45.740
also obviously that applies to

03:14:45.807 --> 03:14:46.307
the census friends under pan

03:14:46.374 --> 03:14:47.709
and I doctor Ben and I we-

03:14:47.776 --> 03:14:51.479
participated in the meeting.

03:14:51.546 --> 03:14:52.113
Like a year and a half ago now-

03:14:52.180 --> 03:14:53.715
we're we kind of you had. We

03:14:53.782 --> 03:14:55.650
were scared straight about that

03:14:55.717 --> 03:14:57.685
what could happen- as we get up

03:14:57.752 --> 03:15:01.556
to census day- where is there a

03:15:01.623 --> 03:15:03.591
process where people can go if

03:15:03.658 --> 03:15:05.593
they see things out in the

03:15:05.660 --> 03:15:06.227
community or on social media.

03:15:06.294 --> 03:15:07.929
That they think are inaccurate-

03:15:07.996 --> 03:15:09.931
in regards to the census where

03:15:09.998 --> 03:15:11.866
that- the where they can report

03:15:11.933 --> 03:15:13.468
something and that information

03:15:13.535 --> 03:15:14.102
will get filtered up and then

03:15:14.169 --> 03:15:15.737
maybe it is our plan to

03:15:15.804 --> 03:15:17.472
communicate with different

03:15:17.539 --> 03:15:18.106
social media platforms. To make

03:15:18.173 --> 03:15:19.841
sure that they're pulling

03:15:19.908 --> 03:15:20.408
things down as quickly as

03:15:20.475 --> 03:15:21.676
possible if there's

03:15:21.743 --> 03:15:25.780
misinformation being sprayed on

03:15:25.847 --> 03:15:27.749
the platforms. Certainly the

03:15:27.816 --> 03:15:28.383
census bureau headquarters they

03:15:28.450 --> 03:15:29.884
do have a team that's looking

03:15:29.951 --> 03:15:30.518
at that looking at social media

03:15:30.585 --> 03:15:31.753
so any of the negative they

03:15:31.820 --> 03:15:33.755
pretty much. Are are on it to

03:15:33.822 --> 03:15:35.590
get those- taken care of- but

03:15:35.657 --> 03:15:37.659
the phone numbers are listed

03:15:37.725 --> 03:15:41.463
there and yes- that's the hard

03:15:41.529 --> 03:15:42.063
part in it applies to jobs as

03:15:42.130 --> 03:15:43.498
well because everyone that's-

03:15:43.565 --> 03:15:45.900
Google in at- again if you have

03:15:45.967 --> 03:15:47.635
a like an eighteen. At the

03:15:47.702 --> 03:15:48.269
Google everything Sir according

03:15:48.336 --> 03:15:50.004
to my son I don't work for the

03:15:50.071 --> 03:15:51.739
census bureau because he Google

03:15:51.806 --> 03:15:52.307
button he called the wrong

03:15:52.373 --> 03:15:53.875
office and I don't work there.

03:15:53.942 --> 03:15:56.010
Right you have to be careful I

03:15:56.077 --> 03:15:58.012
would say just send everyone to

03:15:58.079 --> 03:15:59.881
the official website. Twenty

03:15:59.948 --> 03:16:01.716
twenty census dot gov for

03:16:01.783 --> 03:16:03.585
information. There's numbers

03:16:03.651 --> 03:16:04.285
there we have the toll free job

03:16:04.352 --> 03:16:05.854
find that's on all of the

03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:07.822
information that they can be

03:16:07.889 --> 03:16:09.858
transferred to. A we have to be

03:16:09.924 --> 03:16:13.595
careful with mirror sites- and

03:16:13.661 --> 03:16:14.129
they've applied ended up

03:16:14.195 --> 03:16:15.964
applied to the census jobs. My

03:16:16.030 --> 03:16:17.799
son accidentally. On apply to

03:16:17.866 --> 03:16:19.901
job had. Questions that we

03:16:19.968 --> 03:16:21.769
didn't have it has the census

03:16:21.836 --> 03:16:23.638
bureau logo. Login as much as

03:16:23.705 --> 03:16:25.707
possible direct them to the

03:16:25.773 --> 03:16:26.374
official site make sure it has

03:16:26.441 --> 03:16:27.942
Dodd god at the end. I don't

03:16:28.009 --> 03:16:29.844
trust anything that says dot

03:16:29.911 --> 03:16:31.779
com. But yes since you're does

03:16:31.846 --> 03:16:33.948
have some- things in place in

03:16:34.015 --> 03:16:36.017
regards to on things it'll come

03:16:36.084 --> 03:16:37.785
up on social media that they

03:16:37.852 --> 03:16:39.721
can- attacked directing removed

03:16:39.787 --> 03:16:41.789
if it's- yeah. Even beyond the

03:16:41.856 --> 03:16:43.691
whole jobs so I worked as a

03:16:43.758 --> 03:16:45.693
video online that do you know

03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:47.595
is a testimonial somebody

03:16:47.662 --> 03:16:48.196
saying I opened the door to a

03:16:48.263 --> 03:16:49.797
census taker and- and ice was

03:16:49.864 --> 03:16:51.666
with them. Right yeah II is

03:16:51.733 --> 03:16:53.668
there something you know it it

03:16:53.735 --> 03:16:55.803
will there be. A different go

03:16:55.870 --> 03:16:57.672
to the senses website will

03:16:57.739 --> 03:16:59.774
there be a link or a job down

03:16:59.841 --> 03:17:01.643
or anything that says like. You

03:17:01.709 --> 03:17:02.110
know if you reporter

03:17:02.177 --> 03:17:05.580
misinformation that you saw-

03:17:05.647 --> 03:17:07.782
please is a rumors at census

03:17:07.849 --> 03:17:09.684
Dodd goes the exam. That they

03:17:09.751 --> 03:17:11.753
can report it to okay- and then

03:17:11.819 --> 03:17:13.821
I know at national headquarters

03:17:13.888 --> 03:17:15.790
working with Dan avoid it like

03:17:15.857 --> 03:17:17.926
they're actually coming up with

03:17:17.992 --> 03:17:19.761
the process nationally. Yeah to

03:17:19.827 --> 03:17:20.395
try Jeff and we're walking at

03:17:20.461 --> 03:17:21.963
this. Work with it because

03:17:22.030 --> 03:17:22.463
things that star in New

03:17:22.530 --> 03:17:25.767
Hampshire. May seem innocuous

03:17:25.833 --> 03:17:27.802
but- and epidemiology he will

03:17:27.869 --> 03:17:29.904
want to watch to see. How it

03:17:29.971 --> 03:17:31.906
spread Richard can see this. So

03:17:31.973 --> 03:17:34.008
we can inoculate in California

03:17:34.075 --> 03:17:36.077
yeah against those messages

03:17:36.144 --> 03:17:38.012
service. Yeah it's the same

03:17:38.079 --> 03:17:38.613
thing I you know that we saw

03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:40.048
meddling in elections in like

03:17:40.114 --> 03:17:45.853
small random south. American

03:17:45.920 --> 03:17:46.421
countries. Before they metal

03:17:46.487 --> 03:17:51.960
Marlys. As in twenty sixteen

03:17:52.026 --> 03:17:52.527
and we can anticipate that

03:17:52.594 --> 03:17:53.127
they're gonna test things out

03:17:53.194 --> 03:17:53.828
in other communities- before

03:17:53.895 --> 03:17:54.429
they- in March you. Will be

03:17:54.495 --> 03:17:55.063
able to see. What they're doing

03:17:55.129 --> 03:17:56.030
with our primary as well

03:17:56.097 --> 03:17:56.664
exactly. Great but we can find

03:17:56.731 --> 03:17:57.699
out exactly and provide that

03:17:57.765 --> 03:17:58.266
information to see if it's

03:17:58.333 --> 03:17:59.767
going to be on their website or

03:17:59.834 --> 03:18:00.401
if there's gonna be a specific

03:18:00.468 --> 03:18:01.970
number for this. Person center

03:18:02.036 --> 03:18:07.809
pan. Asian just follow up. And

03:18:07.875 --> 03:18:08.443
yet appreciate all the work the

03:18:08.509 --> 03:18:09.010
census bureau's doing. I'm

03:18:09.077 --> 03:18:10.044
actually concerned when you

03:18:10.111 --> 03:18:12.146
said there are mere sites to

03:18:12.213 --> 03:18:14.048
the census okay. Yeah it's very

03:18:14.115 --> 03:18:17.885
easy to go. Dot com verses dot

03:18:17.952 --> 03:18:18.486
gov so that's a really simple

03:18:18.553 --> 03:18:21.723
straightforward thing to do.

03:18:21.789 --> 03:18:23.791
And if you can get and I

03:18:23.858 --> 03:18:24.392
realized- limits to what the

03:18:24.459 --> 03:18:25.860
federal government can do it

03:18:25.927 --> 03:18:26.461
since broken do but if you

03:18:26.527 --> 03:18:29.764
can't solve that problem of

03:18:29.831 --> 03:18:30.365
like taking down or getting

03:18:30.431 --> 03:18:31.899
people to pull down your sites

03:18:31.966 --> 03:18:32.500
are buying up the domain names

03:18:32.567 --> 03:18:36.004
for those. That's a really

03:18:36.070 --> 03:18:37.939
straightforward thing to do.

03:18:38.006 --> 03:18:40.141
And if you can't handle that I

03:18:40.208 --> 03:18:41.909
am very worried about what

03:18:41.976 --> 03:18:43.811
happens on the something a lot

03:18:43.878 --> 03:18:44.412
more sophisticated than that.

03:18:44.479 --> 03:18:46.180
Okay if you're Denver so short

03:18:46.247 --> 03:18:49.951
on jobs and- yet we can't keep

03:18:50.018 --> 03:18:51.819
people from landing on the mere

03:18:51.886 --> 03:18:53.855
sight. Because they type dot

03:18:53.921 --> 03:18:55.923
converse dot gov. I mean let's

03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:57.859
let's hueso selected officials

03:18:57.925 --> 03:18:59.794
we have to deal with campaigns

03:18:59.861 --> 03:19:00.395
we have we know you by every

03:19:00.461 --> 03:19:02.196
dummy site if you can if you

03:19:02.263 --> 03:19:03.798
have the resources that gets

03:19:03.865 --> 03:19:04.399
around because you just don't

03:19:04.465 --> 03:19:06.200
want people. Basically tricking

03:19:06.267 --> 03:19:08.069
people into going somewhere

03:19:08.136 --> 03:19:08.503
else and putting out

03:19:08.569 --> 03:19:10.004
misinformation about you. So I

03:19:10.071 --> 03:19:12.073
would C. say that if that's

03:19:12.140 --> 03:19:14.008
really going on and then that's

03:19:14.075 --> 03:19:16.010
your first test of what you can

03:19:16.077 --> 03:19:17.912
try to do with this information

03:19:17.979 --> 03:19:19.781
if you can't get the- the- I.

03:19:19.847 --> 03:19:22.016
T. community and all the other

03:19:22.083 --> 03:19:23.851
folks that help you and say

03:19:23.918 --> 03:19:24.419
look you know what this is

03:19:24.485 --> 03:19:26.020
misinformation and- people who

03:19:26.087 --> 03:19:27.822
are applying for the census

03:19:27.889 --> 03:19:29.891
were desperate trying to get.

03:19:29.957 --> 03:19:30.425
Are getting diverted and

03:19:30.491 --> 03:19:31.893
getting their- who knows

03:19:31.959 --> 03:19:32.427
they're doing it because

03:19:32.493 --> 03:19:34.228
they're stealing personal ID

03:19:34.295 --> 03:19:35.797
information whatever reason

03:19:35.863 --> 03:19:36.431
they're doing it. We can't shut

03:19:36.497 --> 03:19:39.834
those people down- then we have

03:19:39.901 --> 03:19:42.036
a big problem because- we don't

03:19:42.103 --> 03:19:44.138
have a- in and you should be

03:19:44.205 --> 03:19:46.040
all shut down tomorrow because

03:19:46.107 --> 03:19:46.708
that's about how fast you go to

03:19:46.774 --> 03:19:47.909
work when people first hits

03:19:47.975 --> 03:19:48.543
right if you can't if you takes

03:19:48.609 --> 03:19:50.378
you couple weeks to shut up and

03:19:50.445 --> 03:19:52.080
down like that. It's over the

03:19:52.146 --> 03:19:53.881
game's over it the words

03:19:53.948 --> 03:19:54.515
already out you know it's only

03:19:54.582 --> 03:19:56.050
takes a few days for something

03:19:56.117 --> 03:19:58.119
go viral. And so- I hope that

03:19:58.186 --> 03:20:01.823
we should be Dodd that. The

03:20:01.889 --> 03:20:02.423
people who are working on this

03:20:02.490 --> 03:20:03.958
stuff they should use as

03:20:04.025 --> 03:20:05.960
perhaps as a test. Case of what

03:20:06.027 --> 03:20:07.829
they can try to do to mobilize

03:20:07.895 --> 03:20:08.329
the community the stop

03:20:08.396 --> 03:20:10.098
misinformation. Yeah and they

03:20:10.164 --> 03:20:12.166
understand that- the ones for

03:20:12.233 --> 03:20:15.870
jobs it's job boards like job

03:20:15.937 --> 03:20:16.471
hats those are the ones that

03:20:16.537 --> 03:20:18.106
are are kind of a top because

03:20:18.172 --> 03:20:19.807
they say we have census jobs.

03:20:19.874 --> 03:20:20.274
And they've got their

03:20:20.341 --> 03:20:22.043
disclaimers on that but I'm

03:20:22.110 --> 03:20:22.643
Richard the census bureau is

03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:24.212
working out to make sure that

03:20:24.278 --> 03:20:27.949
it's safe and secure. So this

03:20:28.015 --> 03:20:28.549
is a follow so what's the plan

03:20:28.616 --> 03:20:33.921
to get rid of those sites. Read

03:20:33.988 --> 03:20:34.589
them the ones that we had. This

03:20:34.655 --> 03:20:35.890
would they were like job had to

03:20:35.957 --> 03:20:36.457
we had for. The G. twenty

03:20:36.524 --> 03:20:37.024
twenty jobs most people for

03:20:37.091 --> 03:20:38.059
example the by the key words

03:20:38.126 --> 03:20:38.593
like job had indeed .com

03:20:38.659 --> 03:20:39.193
because we do post on them for

03:20:39.260 --> 03:20:41.829
jobs. But sometimes those. Job

03:20:41.896 --> 03:20:44.165
boards also. Kind of gather the

03:20:44.232 --> 03:20:44.866
information on that on some of

03:20:44.932 --> 03:20:47.835
the applicants. So we- they've

03:20:47.902 --> 03:20:48.503
got a big campaign in place we

03:20:48.569 --> 03:20:50.271
bought. Was been a lot of money

03:20:50.338 --> 03:20:52.173
on key words to make sure that

03:20:52.240 --> 03:20:52.807
the census bureau was right on

03:20:52.874 --> 03:20:56.010
top as far as- census jobs. So

03:20:56.077 --> 03:20:56.611
that kind of happened early on

03:20:56.677 --> 03:20:58.146
but again. I'm talking about

03:20:58.212 --> 03:21:00.181
job hot. Indeed dot com will

03:21:00.248 --> 03:21:02.049
ultimately they do take you to

03:21:02.116 --> 03:21:03.818
the census bureau website but

03:21:03.885 --> 03:21:04.485
they're pretty much. Job boards

03:21:04.552 --> 03:21:06.220
okay so there's no more mirror

03:21:06.287 --> 03:21:08.055
sites is that right now there's

03:21:08.122 --> 03:21:08.689
no more mers all right. Then

03:21:08.756 --> 03:21:11.959
answers the question- a couple

03:21:12.026 --> 03:21:13.895
things first of all- thank you

03:21:13.961 --> 03:21:14.495
both for being here you both

03:21:14.562 --> 03:21:16.397
have. Significant challenges in

03:21:16.464 --> 03:21:18.232
different ways. Of his Carnegie

03:21:18.299 --> 03:21:18.666
thank you for your

03:21:18.733 --> 03:21:20.234
responsiveness we've asked many

03:21:20.301 --> 03:21:22.203
questions of the course last

03:21:22.270 --> 03:21:22.737
year and you've been very

03:21:22.804 --> 03:21:24.138
responsive thank you very much

03:21:24.205 --> 03:21:26.207
for that- the- where where are

03:21:26.274 --> 03:21:28.109
we in terms of metrics in terms

03:21:28.176 --> 03:21:30.211
of enumerators in California.

03:21:30.278 --> 03:21:32.079
We what. Where are we. So for

03:21:32.146 --> 03:21:34.015
killing I think I gave the

03:21:34.081 --> 03:21:36.184
California number open in terms

03:21:36.250 --> 03:21:36.818
of where you expect to be where

03:21:36.884 --> 03:21:43.925
are we are at. For California

03:21:43.991 --> 03:21:44.592
we are at forty four and a half

03:21:44.659 --> 03:21:46.327
percent what what's reform its

03:21:46.394 --> 03:21:48.062
metric for this time of year.

03:21:48.129 --> 03:21:51.933
We expect to be pretty close

03:21:51.999 --> 03:21:53.935
250% so we're getting there and

03:21:54.001 --> 03:21:54.569
again this number changes every

03:21:54.635 --> 03:21:56.237
single day right. So we're

03:21:56.304 --> 03:21:58.039
below where we expect to be

03:21:58.105 --> 03:22:00.007
right. So what's the plan in

03:22:00.074 --> 03:22:02.276
February to accelerate that

03:22:02.343 --> 03:22:04.378
process we started accelerating

03:22:04.445 --> 03:22:06.180
our process now again the

03:22:06.247 --> 03:22:08.115
census bureau put a just now

03:22:08.182 --> 03:22:10.117
finding and for paid

03:22:10.184 --> 03:22:12.086
advertisement- increase a goal

03:22:12.153 --> 03:22:14.121
they've increased our staffing

03:22:14.188 --> 03:22:14.755
so we have additional recording

03:22:14.822 --> 03:22:16.424
assistance additional boots on

03:22:16.491 --> 03:22:18.059
the ground what. How much have

03:22:18.125 --> 03:22:18.693
we increased our staffing here

03:22:18.759 --> 03:22:20.361
in California to meet our goal

03:22:20.428 --> 03:22:22.230
the last California can got

03:22:22.296 --> 03:22:24.065
back to the actual number but

03:22:24.131 --> 03:22:24.632
nation I mean for our whole

03:22:24.699 --> 03:22:28.169
region- we've increased it. By

03:22:28.236 --> 03:22:28.769
two to three hundred recording

03:22:28.836 --> 03:22:30.338
assistance I see a six point

03:22:30.404 --> 03:22:32.373
five million nationwide is so

03:22:32.440 --> 03:22:36.043
small that it's infinitesimal-

03:22:36.110 --> 03:22:38.379
and I realize that you're not.

03:22:38.446 --> 03:22:40.381
Here because you're running the

03:22:40.448 --> 03:22:42.183
senses for the country but six

03:22:42.250 --> 03:22:42.817
point five million nationwide

03:22:42.884 --> 03:22:46.420
is. Is a pebble in the great

03:22:46.487 --> 03:22:50.324
lake. So is there a plan and if

03:22:50.391 --> 03:22:52.159
there's not a plan will there

03:22:52.226 --> 03:22:52.793
be a plan and will you let us

03:22:52.860 --> 03:22:56.063
know what that plan is because

03:22:56.130 --> 03:22:56.697
if we're if we're behind by say

03:22:56.764 --> 03:23:00.201
8% now. M. we turns out in

03:23:00.268 --> 03:23:02.069
February were still behind.

03:23:02.136 --> 03:23:04.071
There in there's no work plan

03:23:04.138 --> 03:23:04.739
to accelerate recruitment. What

03:23:04.805 --> 03:23:08.175
what what happens. We've

03:23:08.242 --> 03:23:10.278
started now again the national

03:23:10.344 --> 03:23:12.046
campaign is kicking into a D.

03:23:12.113 --> 03:23:12.613
distilling to our regional

03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:14.448
efforts we've got the National

03:23:14.515 --> 03:23:16.183
Kevin going they just started

03:23:16.250 --> 03:23:18.386
at this week so we've increased

03:23:18.452 --> 03:23:20.521
all of our recruiting efforts

03:23:20.588 --> 03:23:22.256
all of our media. Can you let

03:23:22.323 --> 03:23:24.225
us know when a month where we

03:23:24.292 --> 03:23:26.060
if not you may be miss Carnegie

03:23:26.127 --> 03:23:28.062
can let us know where you are

03:23:28.129 --> 03:23:28.696
in a month and have you reached

03:23:28.763 --> 03:23:32.066
out to legislative offices I C.

03:23:32.133 --> 03:23:32.633
reset aggression offices you

03:23:32.700 --> 03:23:34.302
reset the legislative offices

03:23:34.368 --> 03:23:34.902
our partnership to. The group

03:23:34.969 --> 03:23:36.537
that reaches out to legislative

03:23:36.604 --> 03:23:38.439
office to- engage their support

03:23:38.506 --> 03:23:40.508
site but yeah we're reaching

03:23:40.575 --> 03:23:42.376
out and every level of that we

03:23:42.443 --> 03:23:44.645
can and again there's national

03:23:44.712 --> 03:23:46.080
partnerships that are taking

03:23:46.147 --> 03:23:48.115
place as well I don't want to

03:23:48.182 --> 03:23:50.051
be sarcastic here but I'm-

03:23:50.117 --> 03:23:52.286
pretty sure no one's reached

03:23:52.353 --> 03:23:52.954
out to our office I don't know

03:23:53.020 --> 03:23:54.589
about other members it. Is

03:23:54.655 --> 03:23:58.192
anybody reach out to your

03:23:58.259 --> 03:23:58.793
offices from the national. The

03:23:58.859 --> 03:24:02.196
federal government. Jim. Right

03:24:02.263 --> 03:24:02.797
what will we'll find out but-

03:24:02.863 --> 03:24:06.500
just drawing from I'll take

03:24:06.567 --> 03:24:07.068
that information back thing

03:24:07.134 --> 03:24:08.202
right right so far as I know-

03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:10.304
then lastly missed Mr Escovedo

03:24:10.371 --> 03:24:12.073
testified a little earlier

03:24:12.139 --> 03:24:14.108
about certain challenges I

03:24:14.175 --> 03:24:14.709
asked him what his number one

03:24:14.775 --> 03:24:16.143
challenge was in his number one

03:24:16.210 --> 03:24:18.245
challenges- I can't remember

03:24:18.312 --> 03:24:18.779
exactly what he said but

03:24:18.846 --> 03:24:22.083
something about- the changing

03:24:22.149 --> 03:24:24.352
rigorous flexibility whatever

03:24:24.418 --> 03:24:26.387
it may be requirements in if

03:24:26.454 --> 03:24:28.255
each of you could respond to

03:24:28.322 --> 03:24:30.424
his comment in and- you know.

03:24:30.491 --> 03:24:32.293
What to do about it so let me

03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:34.328
start with miss- Kentucky thank

03:24:34.395 --> 03:24:38.299
you so- yes FAA Jean was

03:24:38.366 --> 03:24:38.933
talking about there is a four

03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:40.501
page guidance that came out

03:24:40.568 --> 03:24:42.570
about how can committee great

03:24:42.637 --> 03:24:46.240
bit based groups help on the

03:24:46.307 --> 03:24:48.175
ground- any in that particular

03:24:48.242 --> 03:24:48.676
document there were two

03:24:48.743 --> 03:24:52.179
references to it's against

03:24:52.246 --> 03:24:54.248
federal law to do phone you

03:24:54.315 --> 03:24:54.882
know to do phone banking or to

03:24:54.949 --> 03:24:58.185
call folks robo calls and it's

03:24:58.252 --> 03:25:00.454
against the law- I think it was

03:25:00.521 --> 03:25:04.325
to- to give a tablet at the

03:25:04.392 --> 03:25:06.494
door and so our lawyers owns

03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:08.562
long as as well as some other.

03:25:08.629 --> 03:25:10.531
Advocates lawyers have been

03:25:10.598 --> 03:25:12.166
looking at that and they cannot

03:25:12.233 --> 03:25:14.368
find the federal we've asked

03:25:14.435 --> 03:25:16.337
for the federal law that it's

03:25:16.404 --> 03:25:18.439
against- and so that's where I

03:25:18.506 --> 03:25:19.040
think there's some angst at

03:25:19.106 --> 03:25:22.176
least from our office as well

03:25:22.243 --> 03:25:24.178
as a lot of our partners like a

03:25:24.245 --> 03:25:24.812
train because you're giving it

03:25:24.879 --> 03:25:26.547
this guidance but it's not

03:25:26.614 --> 03:25:28.449
state in any law at if you know

03:25:28.516 --> 03:25:32.319
it so that's part of it is how

03:25:32.386 --> 03:25:36.323
do we interpret that- and so

03:25:36.390 --> 03:25:38.526
we're in the process of trying

03:25:38.592 --> 03:25:40.361
to Askar lorries how do we

03:25:40.428 --> 03:25:42.329
interpret it if it's there's

03:25:42.396 --> 03:25:42.930
nothing enter Brett. I think

03:25:42.997 --> 03:25:44.331
that's where the AG's office

03:25:44.398 --> 03:25:46.300
been formed- I'm not sure I'll

03:25:46.367 --> 03:25:46.934
have to probably should now all

03:25:47.001 --> 03:25:50.204
of this is last call for drinks

03:25:50.271 --> 03:25:54.208
or whether we're being kicked.

03:25:54.275 --> 03:25:54.809
Out but the it's are going off

03:25:54.875 --> 03:25:58.245
on so let me let me just. I

03:25:58.312 --> 03:26:00.414
don't want to stop your

03:26:00.481 --> 03:26:02.316
response yeah if you're

03:26:02.383 --> 03:26:02.850
finished them M. turned ms

03:26:02.917 --> 03:26:04.518
Connell. What what are your

03:26:04.585 --> 03:26:05.052
thoughts on Mr excavators

03:26:05.119 --> 03:26:06.687
testimony. I don't know if I

03:26:06.754 --> 03:26:08.756
got it's disappointing because

03:26:08.823 --> 03:26:09.356
I did a step back but can you

03:26:09.423 --> 03:26:10.491
just kind of give me what he

03:26:10.558 --> 03:26:11.092
said was is I. S. was biggest

03:26:11.158 --> 03:26:11.726
challenge and what he said was

03:26:11.792 --> 03:26:14.361
biggest challenges that. And

03:26:14.428 --> 03:26:16.297
I'm paraphrasing now is that

03:26:16.363 --> 03:26:16.931
the requirements of the federal

03:26:16.997 --> 03:26:18.566
government one seem to be

03:26:18.632 --> 03:26:22.303
inconsistent with- what they

03:26:22.369 --> 03:26:22.937
understand is standard practice

03:26:23.003 --> 03:26:26.474
so for example making phone

03:26:26.540 --> 03:26:26.974
calls. In that they keep

03:26:27.041 --> 03:26:28.576
changing so I. Is that does

03:26:28.642 --> 03:26:30.811
that do any visibility on that.

03:26:30.878 --> 03:26:32.580
Does that relate to our

03:26:32.646 --> 03:26:33.147
employees working with the

03:26:33.214 --> 03:26:34.582
census can you that that

03:26:34.648 --> 03:26:36.350
relates to so for example if

03:26:36.417 --> 03:26:38.385
I'm running community based

03:26:38.452 --> 03:26:38.953
organization I want to make

03:26:39.019 --> 03:26:40.354
phone calls to people to

03:26:40.421 --> 03:26:42.556
community. After you know April

03:26:42.623 --> 03:26:43.057
ten I see that a certain

03:26:43.124 --> 03:26:44.525
precinct is not being

03:26:44.592 --> 03:26:46.560
responsive. So if I wanna make

03:26:46.627 --> 03:26:48.362
phone calls to individuals in

03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:50.331
that precinct. According to- I

03:26:50.397 --> 03:26:52.633
guess the latest guidance

03:26:52.700 --> 03:26:53.234
that's a violation of federal

03:26:53.300 --> 03:26:56.537
law. However that doesn't seem

03:26:56.604 --> 03:26:58.639
to be. The that there's at

03:26:58.706 --> 03:27:00.374
least ambiguity there so. Do

03:27:00.441 --> 03:27:04.311
you have any comment on that. I

03:27:04.378 --> 03:27:04.912
don't have any comment on that

03:27:04.979 --> 03:27:06.480
I have to check I think what we

03:27:06.547 --> 03:27:07.114
need to do is get that resolved

03:27:07.181 --> 03:27:08.682
and maybe maybe the AG's office

03:27:08.749 --> 03:27:10.684
can help us get that results

03:27:10.751 --> 03:27:12.720
so. Okay thank you very much- I

03:27:12.787 --> 03:27:14.722
I. most grateful let me thank

03:27:14.789 --> 03:27:16.657
the Senate assembly staff that

03:27:16.724 --> 03:27:18.592
are here. I know it is a-

03:27:18.659 --> 03:27:20.594
challenge to have hearings

03:27:20.661 --> 03:27:22.396
outside the state capitol in a

03:27:22.463 --> 03:27:24.298
most grateful for your support.

03:27:24.365 --> 03:27:24.932
And also most grateful for the

03:27:24.999 --> 03:27:26.667
support of the city of Long

03:27:26.734 --> 03:27:28.402
Beach and providing- buses

03:27:28.469 --> 03:27:30.404
facility in hosting. And I

03:27:30.471 --> 03:27:32.506
think with that we will be

03:27:32.573 --> 03:27:36.410
adjourned for. Time being. I'm

03:27:36.477 --> 03:27:36.944

yes. Let me let me you're right

03:27:40.481 --> 03:27:40.981
so let me let me take public

03:27:41.048 --> 03:27:44.485
comment here. Right so if you

03:27:46.720 --> 03:27:48.489
we could actually as people

03:27:48.556 --> 03:27:49.089
line up so I could just have

03:27:49.156 --> 03:27:50.825
some sort of visuals to those

03:27:50.891 --> 03:27:56.397
who wish to testify. And then-

03:27:56.463 --> 03:27:58.465
if you could identify yourself

03:27:58.532 --> 03:28:00.401
if you're with an organization-

03:28:00.467 --> 03:28:02.770
and where you live that would

03:28:02.837 --> 03:28:06.640
be most useful- and I'm gonna

03:28:06.707 --> 03:28:07.241
ask that we limit ourselves to

03:28:07.308 --> 03:28:08.642

03:28:32.499 --> 03:28:34.535
of our focus for the last year

with our families to make them

03:28:50.718 --> 03:28:52.753

And we've committed to ensuring

03:29:01.128 --> 03:29:02.763
that fifty seven of our

03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:04.632

one of our schools is going to

03:29:06.567 --> 03:29:08.535

03:29:16.644 --> 03:29:17.211
that I wanted to state as that

03:29:17.278 --> 03:29:20.481
in September. The district. In

03:29:20.547 --> 03:29:22.483
collaboration with them many of

03:29:22.549 --> 03:29:23.083
the complete count committees

03:29:23.150 --> 03:29:26.587
that we engage in- we start

03:29:27.288 --> 03:29:28.822
the parts that were in de

03:29:28.889 --> 03:29:30.658
committing to it. And I wanted

03:29:30.724 --> 03:29:32.960
to see one thing that is really

03:29:33.027 --> 03:29:36.430
concerned as the past couple of

03:29:36.497 --> 03:29:40.534
weeks. In November we- what

03:29:40.601 --> 03:29:44.471
bands. The P. for the county at.

03:29:44.538 --> 03:29:46.607

03:29:46.674 --> 03:29:47.241
we were sadly M. informed that

03:29:47.308 --> 03:29:48.442
along with the city of Santana.

03:29:48.509 --> 03:29:49.009
Our award letter had been

03:29:49.076 --> 03:29:50.511
rescinded so I'm gonna ask for

03:29:50.577 --> 03:29:51.111
your support in that. Because

03:29:51.178 --> 03:29:51.712
we're still committed and one

03:29:51.779 --> 03:29:52.680
of the reasons that is the

03:29:52.746 --> 03:29:54.615
district we're asking for this

03:29:54.682 --> 03:29:56.517
is to ensure that. All fifty

03:29:56.583 --> 03:29:57.117
seven centers are open after

03:29:57.184 --> 03:30:00.421

03:30:00.487 --> 03:30:02.423
to all those other families who

03:30:02.489 --> 03:30:04.425
are probably working multiple

03:30:04.491 --> 03:30:05.059

03:33:32.866 --> 03:33:34.668
second thing that I also wanna-

03:33:34.735 --> 03:33:36.870
highlight ease the- the ongoing

03:33:36.937 --> 03:33:38.772
effort by the trump

03:33:38.839 --> 03:33:39.306
administration to actually

03:33:39.373 --> 03:33:40.974
suppress. The participation of

03:33:41.041 --> 03:33:43.010
the census of one of the key

03:33:43.076 --> 03:33:44.778
aspect is thick islands. That

03:33:44.845 --> 03:33:46.680
were mentioned by Mister

03:33:46.747 --> 03:33:47.247
Frankel those are something

03:33:47.314 --> 03:33:49.082
that we're trying to really

03:33:49.149 --> 03:33:51.018
figure out in Washington DC

03:33:51.084 --> 03:33:53.053
what's the purpose of it. Given

03:33:53.120 --> 03:33:54.788
the fact that actually tried

03:33:54.855 --> 03:33:56.690
the X. and the thing died in

03:33:56.757 --> 03:33:57.324
the US census really early on.

03:33:57.391 --> 03:33:57.925
And so we're really trying to

03:33:57.991 --> 03:33:59.092
figure out and the fact that

03:33:59.159 --> 03:34:00.794
when we trying to analyze with

03:34:00.861 --> 03:34:02.796
the statue the federal statute

03:34:02.863 --> 03:34:04.765
does not make any sense. As it

03:34:04.831 --> 03:34:06.800
relates that's waiting one is

03:34:06.867 --> 03:34:08.769
up to your office the

03:34:08.835 --> 03:34:09.336
governor's office but knows

03:34:09.403 --> 03:34:10.971
that the AG's office to really

03:34:11.038 --> 03:34:14.741
push for clarification. As it

03:34:14.808 --> 03:34:15.375
relates to that. Lastly as as

03:34:15.442 --> 03:34:20.681
as as we move forward on the-

03:34:20.747 --> 03:34:21.281
there's one eight things that

03:34:21.348 --> 03:34:21.815
usually stick to do is to.

03:34:21.882 --> 03:34:27.120
Decide. I reject in a in a and

03:34:27.187 --> 03:34:28.855
coach. Says anyway and so by

03:34:28.922 --> 03:34:29.423
using holidays and that's

03:34:29.489 --> 03:34:29.990
something that we will reach

03:34:30.057 --> 03:34:31.258
out to. Your offices to trying

03:34:31.325 --> 03:34:32.793
to get the help and with that

03:34:32.859 --> 03:34:33.360
we appreciate all the work.

03:34:33.427 --> 03:34:34.895
Thank you. Thank you very much.
