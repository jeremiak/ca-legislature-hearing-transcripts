ESTABLISH PROCESSES FOR HOW THEY

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:11.804
WILL OVERSEE THESE COLLEGES.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.139
THEY ALSO ESTABLISH CONSUMER

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.874
PROTECTIONS FOR THE RESIDENTS

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.008
WHO ARE ENROLLED IN COLLEGES.

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:18.845
NOW THESE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE

AS A FOR INSTANCE FEDERAL LAW

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:46.672
RECOGNIZES STATES BROAD

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:50.843
WHERE'S CONGRESS IN THE US

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.944
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.312
DEFINED VERY CLEAR TERMS AND

ACCREDITING AGENCIES.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:59.452
HOWEVER THESE ROLES MAYBE

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.386
EVOLVING IN WAYS THAT ARE

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:01.821
CRITICAL FOR STATES TO

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.256
UNDERSTAND.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.390
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.325
CURRENTLY MIDSTREAM IN A WIDE

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.760
REACHING DE REGULATORY EFFORT

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:08.995
THAT WOULD WEAKEN OVERSIGHT BY

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.062
BOTH THE CREDITORS AND THE

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.398
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR INSTANCE

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:13.800
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:14.867
CHANGES THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.369
ELIMINATE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:18.137
REGIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:19.539

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:20.606
AGENCIES.

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:22.441
IT THIS DISTINCTION IS RELIED

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:23.709
UPON IN CALIFORNIA LAW TO BOTH

ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS AND

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.552
COLLEGES ARE WHY ASK.

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.954
ARE EXEMPT FROM BBB OVERSIGHT

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.422
UNDER STATE LAW.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:37.089
IT IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE STATE

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:38.324
CAL GRANTS THE SIZE OF THE CAL

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.059
GRANT THEY CAN RECEIVE --

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:40.927
CAN DEPEND ON WHETHER OR NOT

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:42.161
THEY ARE ACCREDITED BY WHY ASK

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.029
FOR THESE PROVISIONS WOULD MAKE

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:43.863
LITTLE SENSE OF THOSE

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.765
DISTINCTIONS WERE RAISED AND

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.033
FEDERAL LAW.

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.634
I'M IN ANOTHER PROPOSED CHANGE

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:49.168
CHANGE OF THE TRUMP

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.736
ADMINISTRATION CURRENT RULES

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.104
ALLOW ACCREDITED COLLEGES TO

ACADEMIC PROGRAM TO OUTSIDE

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.243
ENTITIES WHICH THEMSELVES ARE

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.811
UNACCREDITED --

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:00.546
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:02.215
TO RAISE THAT HALFLIMIT THAT

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:05.051
50% LIMIT 275% PROVIDING

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.519
TAXPAYER SUBSIDY TO PROGRAMS

OFFERED PRIMARILY BY

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.488
UNACCREDITED PROVIDERS.

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:11.190
EARLIER IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS THAT

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:13.125
MINISTRATION PROPOSED TO

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.061
ELIMINATE THAT LIMIT ENTIRELY.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.696
ALSO UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL RULES

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:18.197
ACCREDITING AGENCIES THEMSELVES

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:19.298
MUST COMPLY WITH A SLATE OF

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.900
CRITERIA TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.435
ABILITY TO HOLD COLLEGES

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:23.502
ACCOUNTABLE.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:24.871
AN AGENCY THAT DON'T MEET THOSE

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.239
CRITERIA CAN LOSE FEDERAL

00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:27.573
RECOGNITION MEANING THAT THE

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.308
AGENCIES ACCREDITATION NO LONGER

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.277
ABLE TO SCHOOL TO GET FEDERAL

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.411
FINANCIAL AID --

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:33.913
WELL ACCREDITING AGENCIES LOSING

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.082
RECOGNITION AND IN THIS WAY IS

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:37.383
INCREDIBLY RARE IT DIDN'T REACH

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.518
OCCUR RECENTLY IT OCCURRED IN

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.119
TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE OBAMA

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.687
ADMINISTRATION ENDED RECOGNITION

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.289
OF THE ACCREDITING COUNCIL FOR

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.624
INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.826
OR KNOWN AS A CICS.

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:50.396
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:50.863
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHILE

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.765
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT A CICS WAS

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.233
STILL NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.501
REQUIRED STANDARDS.

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:57.003
NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.804
LOOKING TO CHANGE FEDERAL RULES

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:00.106
AROUND ACCREDITATION.

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:01.407
SO TO ALLOW RECOGNITION OF

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.175
ACCREDITING AGENCIES THAT MERELY

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:05.745
SHOW SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:06.512
THE STANDARDS NOT FULL

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:08.714
COMPLIANCE AND IT'S FURTHER

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:09.181
WEAKENING THE MEANING

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:10.850
ACCREDITATION.

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.919
I'M THIS IS IN ADDITION TO YOU --

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:13.953
OTHER CHANGESTHAT THE TRUMP

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.854
ADMINISTRATION IS ALREADY

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:16.188
PROPOSED INCLUDING ELIMINATING

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.456
THE FEDERAL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:19.258
RULE THAT ENFORCES THE HIGHER

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.393
EDUCATION ACT'S REQUIREMENT.

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:21.994
THAT CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAMS

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:22.962
PREPARE STUDENTS FOR GAINFUL

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.363
EMPLOYMENT AND RECOGNIZED

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.665
OCCUPATION.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.732
ON THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:27.934
PROPOSED A SCALE BACK RULES

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.834
PROVIDING STUDENT LOAN JUST

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:29.869
CHARGES TO STUDENTS IN

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:32.305
CONNECTION WITH FRAUD OR OTHER

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:32.872
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES OF THEIR

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:33.873
SCHOOLS --

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.641
STATE LEVEL ACCOUNTING OF THE

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.510
NUMBER OF THE STUDENTS WHO OF

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:38.844
COURSE FILED CLAIMS FOR BORROWER

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.880
DEFENSE DISCHARGES SHOW THAT ONE

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.382
IN FIVE CLAIMANTS ARE CAP FROM

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:44.483
CALIFORNIA.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.651
SO NONE OF THESE RULES WILL GO

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:47.653
INTO EFFECT UNTIL JULY TWENTY

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.587
TWENTY AT THE EARLIEST AND SOME

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.156
OF THEM MAY BE CHALLENGED IN

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.157
COURT EXTENDING THEM EVEN

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:51.757
FURTHER.

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.225
BUT THEY NONE THE LESS REPRESENT

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:54.660
OF FAR REACHING THE REGULATORY

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.228
AGENDA THAT WOULD SCALE BACK

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:58.597
STUDENT TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS AND

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.599
OPEN NEW AVENUES FOR ABUSE.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:01.467
THE CNGRESS IS ALSO POISED TO

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:02.768
RE AUTHORIZE THE HIGHER

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.270
EDUCATION ACT --

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:05.304
GOVERNING FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.373
PROGRAMS AND DEMOCRATS AND

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.507
REPUBLICANS HAVE WITH WIDELY

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:10.409
DIVERGENT VIEWS ON WHAT CHANGES

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:12.712
NEED TO BE MADE TO A PROPERLY

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:13.813
HOLD COLLEGES ACCOUNTABLE.

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.047
AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THIS

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:17.116
ACTIVITY IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:18.551
FOR STATES TO THINK ABOUT THE

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.653
CONSUMER PROTECTION ROLLED MORE

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.287
BROADLY THAN THEY HAVE IN THE

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:22.555
PAST. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:23.756
RESIDENTS OF THE LEVEL OF

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:24.790
PROTECTION THAT THEY DEEM

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.859
APPROPRIATE REGARDLESS OF HOW

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:29.462
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROCEEDS.

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:30.296
SO I WOULD LIKE NOW TO DISCUSS

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.263
WITH YOU THREE IMPORTANT

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.465
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FOR PROFIT

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:34.367
COLLEGE LANDSCAPE AND HOW THEY

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:35.901
RELATE TO CALIFORNIA.

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:36.902
THE FIRST --

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:38.104
IS THE ISSUE OF SCHOOLS THAT

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.673
CLOSE UNEXPECTEDLY AND BEFORE

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.240
STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO FINISH

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.308
THEIR PROGRAMS.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.676
SINCE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN CLOSURE

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.244
OF CORINTHIAN COLLEGES WHICH

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.346
PRIMARILY AFFECTED CALIFORNIANS

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.415
SEVERAL OTHER FOR PROFIT COLLEGE

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.017
CHAIN SOME CLOSE THEIR DOORS.

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:51.884
WESTWOOD COLLEGE ENROLLED

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.020
PRIMARY PRIMARILY CALIFORNIANS

00:10:54.086 --> 00:10:55.187
BEFORE IT CLOSED.

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.689
OF THE FIFTY SIX CAMPUSES OF

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:57.990
MARINELLA SCHOOLS OF BEAUTY THAT

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.126
BECAUSE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THIRTY

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:01.861
NINE OF THEM THIRTY NINE OF THE

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:03.529
FIFTY SIX WERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.264
OTHER CLOSURES INCLUDING ITT

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.599
TECHNICAL INSTITUTES AND SCHOOLS

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.401
OWN BY THE EDUCATION CORPORATION

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:09.468
OF AMERICA INCLUDING BRIGHT WHAT

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:10.436
COLLEGE.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.304
I HAVEN'T ALSO INCLUDED LARGE

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:13.773
NUMBERS OF CALIFORNIANS.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.041
NO SCHOOL CLOSURES CAN LEAVE

00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:16.342
STUDENTS UNABLE TO FINISH THE

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.810
PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THEY BORROWED

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:19.645
TO ATTEND CAN BE DISASTROUS FOR

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:20.813
STUDENTS.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.847
SCHOOL THAT CLOSE TEND TO BE

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:23.182
ONES WITH RELATIVELY POOR

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.884
REPUTATIONS AND EVEN STUDENTS

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.285
WHO ARE ABLE TO TRANSFER THEIR

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:27.486
COURSE WORK TO COMPLETE THEIR

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:29.955
PROGRAM MAY NOT BE WELL SERVED.

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:31.390
AND REPUTABLE SCHOOLS MAY NOT

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:32.792
ACCEPT THE COURSEWORK TAKEN AT

BEST TO STRENGTHEN OVERSIGHT IT

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:24.703
SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT ADDITIONAL

IT'S ALSO --

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:58.303
TROUBLING --

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.538
I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:01.940
OTHERS ABOUT --

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:03.075
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULDN'T AT

00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:04.510
SHOULD BE DOING.

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:06.712
BUT I I I GUESS I'D LIKE TO BE

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:07.412
PROVOCATIVE AT THE BEGINNING

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:08.447
HERE --

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:09.314
YOU'VE MADE A NUMBER OF

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:11.250
SUGGESTIONS OF OF WHERE YOU

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:12.951
THINK WE COULD BE DOING BETTER.

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:14.253
WOULD YOU TALK TO ME FOR A

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.921
MOMENT ABOUT OUR CURRENT BUREAU

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.623
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE THAT THE

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:19.691
END IS INVOLVED IN THESE AREAS --

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:21.226
WE ARE THEY INVOLVED ARE THEY

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.661
NOT WHAT'S YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:23.962
THEM OR OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.830
WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING WE'RE

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:26.064
GONNA HEAR FROM THEM IN A FEW

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.432
MINUTES BUT I THINK WE BENEFIT

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:29.268
FROM HERE.

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.136
YOUR EXAMINATION ON OUR BEHALF

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:32.237
AS TO WHERE THEY'RE GOING RIGHT

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:35.340
AND WRONG.

00:19:35.407 --> 00:19:36.041
YEAH THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:37.743
QUESTION I FEEL LIKE IT I'M NOT

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:38.944
AS FAMILIAR CERTAINLY AS YOUR

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:40.112
FLAWS A SUBSEQUENT PANELS WILL

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:41.380
BE IN TERMS OF THE DAY TO DAY

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:44.049
OPERATIONS OF THE BUREAU I THINK.

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.150
IMPORTANT STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:46.184
IN RECENT YEARS --

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:48.287
IMPORTANTLY THE CREATION OF THAT

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:49.688
OF SORRY THE OFFICE OF STUDENT

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.123
ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF --

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:52.124
I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN A VERY

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.892
ACTIVE WITH SOME DEVELOPMENTS OF

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:55.327
LATE -- I

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:57.329
THINK WHAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT AS

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:58.463
YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WELL THEY'RE

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.232
IMPLEMENTING THAT LAWS THAT ARE

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.199
CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS IS THE

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:02.601
THINK ABOUT WHAT NEW AUTHORITY

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:04.703
EITHER THEY OR OTHER ENTITIES

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.072
WILL NEED TO PROVIDE BACKSTOPS

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:07.639
TO SOME OF WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:08.707
FEDERALLY.

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:11.410
ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY INITIATIVES

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:13.378
THAT THEIR ADVANCE SOME OF THEM

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:16.081
ARE PRETTY. FOR YOU WHERE

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:17.149
THEY'VE BEEN PROBLEMS FOR A LONG

00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:18.817
TIME ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:19.318
INITIATIVES THEY'VE BEEN

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:21.620
ADVANCING --

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:22.921
I AM NOT OKAY.

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:23.789
I GUESS THAT WOULD GIVE THEM

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:25.290
SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:26.758
QUESTION WHERE THEY GET UP HERE.

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:28.594
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.162
COUPLE QUESTIONS.

00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:31.964
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE TRUMP

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.299
ADMINISTRATION WEAKENING THE

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.535
ACCREDITATION PROCESS?

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.437
WILL THIS THEN MAKE IT HARDER

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:39.771
FOR STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE FROM

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:41.373
THE SCHOOLS HARDER FOR THEM TO

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.275
FIND A JOB BECAUSE WE DEAL IF

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.744
THEY'RE NOT ACCREDITED WE CAN.

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.879
EXTRAPOLATE OUT THAT THEY ARE

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:49.114
PROVIDING THE BEST EDUCATION

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.983
POSSIBLE.

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:52.517
I MEAN DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE.

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:53.318
YEAH I MEAN I THINK WHAT WILL

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:55.954
HAPPEN IS WE'LL MAKE IT EASIER

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:56.421
FOR COLLEGES TO BECOME

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:57.556
ACCREDITED --

00:20:57.623 --> 00:20:58.924
SAID THIS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:00.092
THAT IT DOES NOT MEAN AS I'D

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:00.859
LIKE WHETHER OR NOT THAT

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.628
ACCREDITED ACCREDITATION STANDS

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.596
FOR QUALITY IS WHAT WILL CHANGE

00:21:04.663 --> 00:21:06.231
AND THAT IN TURN OF COURSE WILL

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:07.065
MAKE IT HARDER.

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:08.033
FOR STUDENTS GET THE EDUCATION

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.901
THEY NEED AND THEN FIND AND HOLD

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:10.802
JOBS.

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:12.004
THANK YOU THAT WAS MY POINT I

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.338
WAS TRYING TO MAKE.

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.240
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SCHOOLS THAT

00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:16.842
HAVE CLOSED --

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.510
QUITE A FEW IN THE PAST COUPLE

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.712
OF YEARS IS THERE A COMMON THEME

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:22.914
ARE COMMON DENOMINATOR AND WHY

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.616
THE SCHOOLS CLOSED IS IT

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:28.620
FINANCIAL IS IT --

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:31.490
ARE THEY NOT BEING RUN PROP --

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.958
I THINK IT WILL I THINK YOU

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:34.693
WOULD PROBABLY FIND SOME OF BOTH

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.894
OF THOSE THINGS --

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:37.362
YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE NOT BE

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:39.064
FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE --

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.499
AND THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:42.100
SCHOOLS WERE NOT DOING WHAT THEY

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:42.367
NEED IT.

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:43.068
OKAY.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.803
AND THEN WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.271
THE DECEPTIVE WAYS.

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:47.939
AND WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:49.841
NUMBERS IF THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:52.044
PLACE WAS SAYING THAT THE PLACE

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.346
80% OF THEIR GRADUATES BUT THEN

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:56.448
WHEN SOMEONE CAME IN AND REALLY

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:58.216
CALCULATED THAT NUMBER IS ONLY

00:21:58.283 --> 00:21:59.217
26%.

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:00.686
ARE THE ARE THE SCHOOLS ARE WE

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:01.420
ARE WE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.488
SCHOOLS ARE JUST MAKING THESE

00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:04.823
NUMBERS UP.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.591
I'M WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THAT

00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:07.893
PARTICULAR EXAMPLE BECAUSE NOT

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:08.760
SURE ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:09.394
DIFFERENCE --

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:10.996
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:12.464
SCHOOLS CAN BE --

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:13.298
YOU KNOW.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:15.200
USE RECORDS I'M IN A WAY THAT

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:17.002
DOES NOT REPRESENT AN ACTUAL JOB

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:17.969
PLACEMENT --

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:20.772
COUNTING SOMEONE WHO WAS --

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.741
EMPLOYED FOR A SINGLE DAY AND

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:23.709
THE JOB FOR INSTANCE HAS

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:26.111
EMPLOYED OR EVEN IN A VOLUNTEER

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.612
POSITION AS EMPLOYED --

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:31.550
SOMETHING THAT ON PAPER MIGHT BE

00:22:31.616 --> 00:22:33.218
DOES NOT REPRESENT EMPLOYMENT IN

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:34.352
ANY MEANINGFUL SENSE OF THE WORD

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:35.921
GOTCHA SO MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE

00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:37.422
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD WORK ON

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:38.623
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.759
BUT MY LAST QUESTION IS WHAT

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:42.594
EXPECTATIONS --

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:44.062
SHOULD SIT A CALIFORNIA HAVE IN

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.598
EXCHANGE FOR GRANTING PRIVATE

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:48.867
POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS THE

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:50.702
AUTHORITY TO OPERATE.

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.338
SHOULD WE EXPECT FROM THEM.

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:54.673
NO I THINK THE EXPECTATION

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.108
SHOULD BE AT ME A BROADLY

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:57.109

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:41.219
FEDERAL MINISTRATION COULD

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:42.988
EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE

00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:45.724

REGIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES --

00:23:57.135 --> 00:23:58.703
OPERATE WITHIN A DEFINED

PROPOSALS AROUND ACCREDITING

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.351
AGENCIES WOULD --

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:15.654
MAKE IT HARD IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.788
FOR ACCREDITING AGENCIES TO

00:24:16.855 --> 00:24:18.623
LIMIT THEIR GEOGRAPHIC REGION

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.192

LIMIT THEIR J. GEOGRAPHIC REGION

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.830

TO BECOME NATIONAL --

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.098
AND WHAT WE WOULD SEE THEN AS

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:28.867
WITH ALL AGENCIES BI NATIONAL IT

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:29.868

THE PROPOSAL WOULD LIMIT THE

00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:50.755
AGENCY'S ABILITY TO PUT

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.691

WASCO ACCREDITATION IN

00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:57.675
PARTICULAR WAS USED IN

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:59.110
CALIFORNIA STATE OVERSIGHT AND

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:00.879
THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM I THINK

00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:01.513
THAT'S A REAL THAT'S A

00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:02.747
RECOGNITION --

00:28:02.814 --> 00:28:04.049
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN THE

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:05.116
PAST LOOKED AT WATCHED

00:28:05.183 --> 00:28:06.885
ACCREDITATION AS AS MEANING

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:08.620
SOMETHING OF HIGH QUALITY AM AND

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:09.421
IT IS ONE OF THE ACCORDING

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:11.356
AGENCIES THAT HAS SHOWN ITSELF

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:12.524
WILLING TO BE --

TO SCRUTINIZE I'M COLLEGES AND

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:16.694
CHANGES IN COLLEGES --

00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:18.930
ME MORE DEEPLY THAN OTHERS --

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:19.731
BUT IT WILL IT WOULD WAKE Và AT

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:20.732
VARIES WIDELY --

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:21.800
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:23.034
WHY SOME OF THE TRUMP

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:25.103
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS. TO

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.305

00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:31.676
REQUIRED STANDARDS TO CONTINUE

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:33.411
TO BE ACCREDITING AGENCIES I'M

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:34.379
BECAUSE IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:36.948
THIS -- THIS

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:39.717
RACE TO THE BOTTOM.

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:41.686
YES PLEASE. THREE IS.

AND CALIFORNIA CAN BE AFFECTED

00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:47.559
BY THIS AND WE EXPECT TO SEE.

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:49.961
A DETERMINATION OF THE QUALITY

00:28:50.028 --> 00:28:52.297
OF HIGHER EDUCATION PARTICULARLY

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:55.900
NOW BECAUSE OF LOWER ACCREDITING

00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:58.736
STANDARDS HERE IN STATE --

00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.271
RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT WHAT WE

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:01.473
HAVE OUR PROPOSALS --

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:02.507
PROPOSES THAT ARE BEING

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:03.108
DISCUSSED --

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:04.476
WITH A SLATE OF STAKEHOLDERS IN

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:06.044

RULES WELL --

00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:12.617
LOOK LIKE IS UNCLEAR BUT I WOULD

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:13.718
SAY ULTIMATELY YES THERE ARE

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:14.853
REASONS FOR THE STATE OF

00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:16.421
CALIFORNIA TO BE CONCERNED I I

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.281
BUT THE PROCESS WASN'T AS CLEAN

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:58.582
AS I IT LIKED IT AND SO RIGHT

00:41:58.649 --> 00:41:59.783
NOW WORKING WITH THE TASK FORCE

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.452
WERE ACTUALLY REVAMPING THAT

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:03.387
PROCESS TO GET A CLEANER PROCESS.

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:04.755
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN THESE

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.290
COMPLAINTS COME IN THEY ARE

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:07.391
ACTUALLY MAY NOT EVEN NEED TO

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:09.026
COME TO THE BUREAU THEY MAY NEED

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:10.427
TO GO TO ANOTHER BUREAU BOARD.

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:12.096
AND SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO SAY

00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:13.230
THAT WE'RE WORKING WILK WITH

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.431
GETTING THAT DONE.

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:16.133
SOME OTHER THINGS THAT THE TASK

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.405

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:29.446
THAT ARE AFTER THE FACT.

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:30.981
NOT ONLY THAT ANOTHER PART OF

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.816
WHAT THEY'RE FOCUSING ON IS OUR

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:34.818
PROCESS THESE WITHIN THE BUREAU

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.720
I FELT LIKE SOME OF THE PROCESS

00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:38.188
THAT WE HAD IN PLACE WORDS TO

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:38.589
SYNC.

00:42:38.656 --> 00:42:40.391
AND THEIR WITH THEIR EXPERTISE

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:42.059
IN ENFORCEMENT IN BACKGROUND

00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:43.027
THEY'RE COMING IN AND LOOKING AT

00:42:43.093 --> 00:42:43.894
THIS AND GIVE US A LOT OF

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:46.130
CREATIVE IDEAS THE FOCUS ON

00:42:46.196 --> 00:42:48.198
BEING ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THINGS

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:50.034
WITH ON THAT FOR A FORSMAN SIDE --

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.835
ANOTHER THING THAT I ALSOWANT

00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:55.472
TO MAKE SURE BRING ATTENTION.

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:58.042
TO IS -- TO

00:42:58.108 --> 00:42:59.243
TO TO TO NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT'S

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.178
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:02.079
NUMBERS THAT I WAS TALKING TO

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:02.713
YOU EARLY.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.081
EARLIER MY GOAL WAS TO GET IT TO

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:06.083
UNDER A THOUSAND BY DECEMBER THE

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.785
END OF THE YEAR AND WE GOT ENDED

00:43:07.851 --> 00:43:09.553
UP IN THE THOUSAND FIFTY SIX

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.554
WITH BRINGING ON THE TASK FORCE

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:11.889
AND ALSO CREATING THAN ON

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:13.190
LICENSE ACTIVITY UNIT.

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:15.526
OUR OUR BACKLOG PER SE RIGHT NOW

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:18.195
IS AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:19.096
SIX NOW THEIR NUMBERS HAVEN'T

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:21.265
BEEN THAT LOW SINCE THE READ

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:23.100
CREATION OF THE BUREAU IN TWO

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:24.201
THOUSAND NINE WHEN HE CAME BACK.

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:25.669
AND SO THOSE ARE EX SICKENING

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:27.071
SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS I THINK IT'S

00:43:27.137 --> 00:43:28.772
IMPORTANT FOR THIS THIS --

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:30.107
COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND AND SEE

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:33.444
THAT WE HAD A HUGE TURNAROUND IN

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.712
FIVE MONTHS OF MY TIME IN THIS

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.513
POSITION FROM GOING FROM A A

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.684
LEVIN OR ONE FIFTY EIGHT TO

00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:41.418
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:42.386
OTHER AREAS THAT I THINK IS

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:42.987
IMPORTANT TO BE AND WITH THE

00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:44.254
DESTRUCTION OF ENFORCEMENT.

00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:45.689
WE ALSO BRING IN AND SPECIAL

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.324
INVESTIGATOR SO THAT WAS PART OF

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:48.425
THIS REAL WORK THAT WE'RE DOING

00:43:48.492 --> 00:43:49.693
WITHIN THE BUREAU SO WE'RE

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.428
BRINGING IN INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:52.830
FOCUS AND THESE ARE ACTUALLY NEW

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.498
POSITIONS THAT I WILL BE HIRING

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:55.532
FOR AN ACTUAL IN THE PROCESS OF

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:56.700
HIRING RIGHT NOW.

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:58.135
SOMEBODY THAT COMES IN THE HAS A

00:43:58.202 --> 00:44:00.938
SPECIFIC INTEREST AND BACKGROUND

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:02.539
IN SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS AND

00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:03.474
THIS IS ANOTHER AREA I THINK

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.975
THAT THAT THE BUREAU NEEDED

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:06.010
SUPPORT.

00:44:06.076 --> 00:44:07.311
AND I THINK WE'RE DOING WELL AND

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:08.312
I THINK WE'LL DO A LOT BETTER

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:09.947
ONCE WE GET THESE INDIVIDUALS IN

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:11.849
THIS POSITION SO NOT ONLY WE

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:13.684
RESTRICTION THE ENFORCEMENT AS A

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:15.386
WHOLE WE'RE ALSO RESTRICTION THE

OVER THESE LAST FEW MONTHS BUT I

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:20.457
THINK YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:22.259
NUMBERS THAT WE ARE TAKING THE

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:24.128
SERIOUS I'M TAKING THE SERIES

00:44:24.194 --> 00:44:26.263

NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS.

I'M INTERESTED IN.

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:58.862

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:07.538
RESOLUTION --

00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:09.073
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:11.842
CUT THE BACKLOG WITHOUT REALLY

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:13.510

THERE'S A PATTERN IN WHICH WOULD

00:45:42.172 --> 00:45:43.373
LEAD US.

CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH THE

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:57.321
TASK FORCE.

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:58.722
IS THAT.

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:01.558
WE NEED SPECIALIZED --

THAT WAS REQUESTED THAT'S FOR

00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:33.917
EASIER ENOUGH.

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:35.819
AND DO YOU HAVE A BROKEN DOWN BY

SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:50.667
PUBLICIZE BECAUSE THE ONGOING

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:51.902

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:58.375
I SEE WHAT'S HARD FOR US TO

00:47:58.442 --> 00:47:59.009
KINDA DO EXIT YOU KNOW YOU YOU

00:47:59.076 --> 00:48:00.444
DO IN YOUR REPORT TO THE

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.878
LEGISLATURE YOU DO PROVIDE.

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:05.115
SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF AND

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:05.749
FOR THAT YOU'RE.

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:08.185
IN SILICON VALLEY UNIVERSITY

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:10.787
SOUTH BAY LOW UNIVERSITY GAVE

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:14.424
TWO CASES THERE --

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:15.959
SO THAT'S HELPFUL BUT THIS --

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:16.493
WHAT TRYING TO GET THE BIG

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.161
PICTURE HERE AT IT DOESN'T MAKE

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:20.264
IT EASY TO DO THAT --

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.432
HOW MANY --

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:24.401
LICENSES DO YOU TURN DOWN IN THE

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:25.936
COURSE OF THE YEAR.

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:27.204
HOW MANY LICENSES THAT WE TURNED

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:28.872
DOWN I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER?

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:31.174
FOR YOU BUT I CAN EASILY GET ON

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.876
AVERAGE --

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.511
SO YOU SHOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:36.113
LOT OF REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:37.414
OF PENDING.

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:40.284
APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSES.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.018
RIGHT YOU SHOW THAT.

00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:45.822
IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN YOU

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:46.390
ELEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR

00:48:46.456 --> 00:48:47.858
PENDING AN INVENTOR OF EIGHTEEN

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:49.660
YOU HAD A HUNDRED FORTY TWO SO I

00:48:49.726 --> 00:48:50.794
GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.929
THEN WHAT'S THE QUALITY ELEMENTS

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:54.765
OF THOSE NUMBER REDUCTIONS IS

00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:58.101
BECAUSE HE SAID DEL.

00:48:58.168 --> 00:49:00.170
OUR YOU SAID YES QUICKER.

00:49:00.237 --> 00:49:02.105
SO AT FIRST OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW I

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:03.674
WAS HERE IN.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.274
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND SO

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:05.342
WITHIN THE LAST YEAR THAT I'VE

00:49:05.409 --> 00:49:07.344
BEEN HERE WHAT I WAS ABLE TO DO

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:09.112
WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT.

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:09.880
COMING INTO THIS ROLE THEY DID

00:49:09.946 --> 00:49:11.581
NOT HAVE A CHIEF FOR ALMOST A

00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:13.183
YEAR AND A HALF IN OUR LICENSING

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.117
UNIT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE

00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:15.686
FIRST THINGS I DID COMING INTO

00:49:15.752 --> 00:49:17.521
THIS ROLE IS GETTING SOMEBODY IN

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:19.056
THERE TO HELP RUN THAT UNIT.

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:21.258
AND I THINK PROBABLY WHAT MAY

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:23.026
HAVE HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:24.728
IS THAT WE JUST TIGHTEN UP

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:26.463
THINGS MOM THAT WOULD BE MY

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.798
ASSUMPTION AT THIS POINT WITHOUT

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:28.932
BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT THE

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.167
NUMBERS CLEARLY.

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:32.035
BUT KNOWING THAT OUR STAFF KNOW

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:34.071
OUR STAFFING LEVELS WERE DOWN

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:36.973
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE BUREAU --

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:37.607
IN BEING ABLE TO UP THE STAFFING

00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:41.044
NO POTENTIALLY WHY YOU'VE SEEN

00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:43.146
SOME OF THE NUMBERS CHANGE.

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:44.881
SO WE HEARD EARLIER TESTIMONY

00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:47.784
FROM -- MS --

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:49.986
COCHRAN SHEIDENTIFIED A NUMBER

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.355
OF AREAS IN WHICH SHE THOUGHT

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.490
THAT -- OUR

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.125
OUR WORK WAS ENDANGERED BY

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:57.828
FEDERAL ACTION --

00:49:57.894 --> 00:50:00.597
ENDANGERED BY --

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.733
ISSUES OF ACCREDITATION --

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:04.000
ENDANGERED BY --

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:06.303
ONLINE.

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.537
ENROLLMENT FOR OUT OF STATE

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:07.838
[inaudible]

00:50:07.904 --> 00:50:11.341
COLLEGES --

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:13.510
AND ENDANGERED BY MISLEADING

00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:15.645
DATA PROVIDED BY A NUMBER OF

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:17.714
PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS YOU SAT

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:18.648

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:19.683
LISTEN TO THAT.

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:20.717
ARE THOSE THINGS THAT YOU'VE

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.486
HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME NO

00:50:22.552 --> 00:50:24.121
THESE ARE ACTUALLY HAVE HAD SOME

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:25.522
CONVERSATION WITH THE CASE AND

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:26.990
THEY'VE BEEN GREAT SUPPORTERS IN

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.158
MYANMAR ROSE BUREAU CHIEF IN

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:29.092
BEING ABLE TO HELP SOME OF THIS

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:30.460
INFORMATION QUITE HONEST.

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:31.828
AND SO NO IT WASN'T THE FIRST

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:33.697
TIME I'VE HEARD IF YOU LOOK IN

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:34.297
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE RULES FOR

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.832
THE BRIDE THE BUREAU SOME OF

00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:39.269
THESE THINGS ARE SUCH THAT ALLOW --

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:40.303
I DON'T SEE ALLOW THAT

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:42.572
POTENTIALLY LIMIT US SO TO SPEAK

00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:44.207
TO THE ONE TO THE ONLINE

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:45.475

WE ARE ABLE TO DO ENFORCEMENT

BUT IT'S IT'S NOT INFORMED SO

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:52.115
BASICALLY THE SCHOOLS OUT OF

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:53.417
STATE ONLINE SCHOOLS ARE

00:50:53.483 --> 00:50:57.120

ACCREDITED AND PAIN IS TRUTH AND

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:01.258
THAT'S THE LIMIT OF OUR

ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:02.959
INSTITUTIONS.

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:04.428
THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:05.662
WE HAVE.

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:07.230

THANK YOU CAN BE AWARE OF

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.734
ENFORCEMENTACTIONS THAT ARE

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:45.969
BEING TAKEN IN THE STATE'S

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:47.037
AGAINST THOSE INSTITUTIONS WOULD

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.406
YOU BE ABLE TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:49.906
THAT.

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:51.208
YES BUT WE STILL WOULD BE ABLE

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.809
TO TAKE ACTION.

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.444
I HATED IT AND I I LOVE IT BUT

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:55.879
IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:56.813
ACTION.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.582
AND BY TO FIND ACTION YOU MEAN

00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:00.417
YOUR ABILITY TO STEP IN WITH

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:02.385
THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND AND FOR

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:03.687
SOME SORT OF ACTIONS AGAINST

00:52:03.753 --> 00:52:05.121
THEM BUT ABSOLUTE BUT YOU'D ALSO

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:06.690
BE IN A POSITION TO LET STUDENTS

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.359
ISSUES.

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:10.694
THAT YOU BECAME AWARE OF ABOUT

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.795
THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.497
STATES WE ARE LAWS VERY LIMITING

00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:16.800
IN THAT IS THAT STUDENT HARM HAS

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:17.367
TO OCCUR.

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.536
MEETING THAT SUCKS SO BRIGHT

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:21.671
WOULD I THINK WAS THE MOST

00:52:21.738 --> 00:52:25.775
RECENT --

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:27.844
ONE THE BRIGHT WOULD WOULD --

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:30.547
WHO'S IN DECEMBER --

00:52:30.614 --> 00:52:31.481
ON MY GOODNESS ARGOSY SORRY.

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:32.716
ARGOSY SO MANY OF THE SCHOOL SO

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:33.283
ARGOSY JUST OCCURRED RIGHT.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.551
IN SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH ARGOSY

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:36.152
IS THAT.

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:37.821
SOME SO THE STATE SO THE FEDERAL

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:39.689
STATE TOOK STEPS IN REGARDS TO

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:41.691
TURN IT CUTTING OFF THEIR TITLE

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:42.559
FOR FUNDING.

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:44.461
BUT AT THAT POINT TIME IT WAS

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:46.396
NOTHING WITHIN THE BUREAU'S LAW

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:47.831
THAT WILL ALLOW THE BUREAU TO

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:49.699
TAKE ACTION.

00:52:49.766 --> 00:52:51.635
BECAUSE WE IT WASN'T ANY.

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:52.836
INTIMATE STUDENTS ARE.

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:54.137
IT WASN'T ANY STUDENT HEART WE

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:58.508
HAD A AFTER THE HOME OR HAPPEN

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:01.711
FOR US TO REACT TO THE STUDENTS.

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:03.513
THAT'S THE LIMITATION OF OUR LAW.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.014
THAT MAKES SENSE AT THE

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.515
CALIFORNIA LAW THAT'S A

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:06.449
CALIFORNIA LAW I THINK THERE

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.517
SHOULD BE CHANGES IN THAT

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:09.052
CALIFORNIA LAW.

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.287
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:11.121
BE LOOKING AT THE BILL SO ALL

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:13.490
THE BUREAUS LAWS A WHOLE I THINK

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:14.824
THAT'S CRITICAL.

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:15.492
AS I THINK I'D BE INTERESTED IN --

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:16.526
I WOULD GUESS THAT MY COLLEAGUES

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:17.727
MIGHT BE AS WELL.

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:19.195
OF ANY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS YOU'D

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:20.964
LIKE TO MAKE THE CHANGE OUR LAWS

00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:21.831
TO BETTER PROTECT OUR STUDENTS

00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:22.866
RIGHT I WOULD I THINK IT WOULD

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.734
BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:26.102
REALLY LOOK AT ALL THE LAWS

00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:27.671
WITHIN THE BUREAU NO QUESTION.

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:28.972
WELL THAT I'LL MAKE THAT AS A

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.840
PENDING REQUESTS AND FOR ME AT

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:31.341
LEAST IS THAT WOULD BE

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:32.242
INTERESTED IN.

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:33.577
YOUR EXPERTISE AND INSIGHT AS TO

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:35.845
WAYS WE COULD CHANGE OUR LAWS TO

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:36.913
BETTER PROTECT STUDENTS IN

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.615
REGARD TO OUT OF STATE.

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:41.051
ONLINE COLLEGES.

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.352

VERY GOOD YOU ALSO RAISE THIS

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:48.124
ISSUE OF WELL THE THE ISSUE OF

YOU SHOULD BE DOING OR WE SHOULD

00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:53.897
BE DOING COLLECTIVELY ON THAT

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.332

THE THINGS FOR ME THAT I HAVE AN

00:53:58.301 --> 00:53:59.502
INTEREST IN DOING IN TRYING TO

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:00.670

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:01.738
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN.

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:03.740

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:50.553
WHY YOU THINK THEIR ACTIONS

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.122

ABSOLUTELY THIS THE MANAGEMENT --

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:32.462
AND AND WHAT ABOUT IN THE ISSUE

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:38.935
OF THE OUTCOMES FALSE OUTCOMES --

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:40.370
SAID MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:41.671
RECRUITMENT THIS IS AGAIN WAS

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:43.473
SOMETHING THAT WAS RAISED

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.407
EARLIER YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:46.409
THAT ABSOLUTELY SO MADE TO ME

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:47.210
THIS IS SICKENING TO BE QUITE

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:48.411
HONEST -- I

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:50.547
WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE APPOINTED

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:51.781
BY THE GOVERNOR THE FORMER

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.349
GOVERNOR TO BE ON CALIFORNIA'S

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:54.584
TO NAY COMMISSION SO I WAS ABLE

00:55:54.651 --> 00:55:56.286
TO SEE A LOT OF HOW THE STUDENTS

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:57.987
ARE AFFECTED THE I. T. T. IS AN

00:55:58.054 --> 00:55:58.922
ILL SOME OF THESE.

00:55:58.988 --> 00:56:01.057
IN SIENA SO FOR ME ABSOLUTELY I

00:56:01.124 --> 00:56:03.860
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:05.395
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.063
PROTECT OUR STUDENTS ON IN OUR

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.998
CONSUMERS BUT ALSO MAKING SURE

00:56:09.065 --> 00:56:09.666
ON OUR PART.

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:11.134
THAT OUR LAWS ARE SUCH THAT

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:12.569
ALLOW US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:14.137
LICENSING INSTITUTIONS THAT

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:15.538
ALLOW THAT ARE BEING ABLE TO

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:17.307
PROVIDE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE

00:56:17.373 --> 00:56:18.742
NEED FOR OUR STUDENTS AND SO

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.844
SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S CALLED

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.312
ARE SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:26.382
GIVEN TO THE BUREAU IS SELF.

00:56:26.449 --> 00:56:28.384
PURPORTED DATA.

00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:29.486
YOU KNOW IT'S NOTHING WE NONE OF

00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:30.420
OUR LAWS ALLOW FORCES SAY THAT

00:56:30.487 --> 00:56:31.654
IT NEEDS TO BE AUDITED OR

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:32.555
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:33.189
AND SO FOR US ALL WE CAN DO IS

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:35.191
ACCEPT THE INFORMATION THAT'S

00:56:35.258 --> 00:56:36.559
BEEN REPORTED TO US.

00:56:36.626 --> 00:56:37.761
SO I I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE TO

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:39.395
ASK IS MY FINAL THOUGHT WOULD BE

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:41.131
THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE IF

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:43.199
THE BUREAU AND DCA COULD COME

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:44.734
BACK TO US WITH SPECIFIC

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.569
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. TO

00:56:46.636 --> 00:56:48.571
ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THESE

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:49.139
SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:49.973

PREVIOUS TESTIMONY AND MAYBE IN

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:53.443
SUBSEQUENT TESTIMONY --

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:54.010
ALL WITH THE IDEA THAT WE'RE

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:56.946
HERE IN THE SAME DIRECTION HERE

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.581

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:07.423
FAIR APPROPRIATE AFFORDABLE AND

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.259
ALL THE REST BUT I THINK WHAT --

00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:11.261
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT.

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:12.729
WE NEED THE BUREAU TO BE DOT

MADAM CHAIR MY QUESTION.

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:55.945
PERTAINS TO OUR VETERANS BECAUSE

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:57.413
PRESENT --

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.648
OVERSEAS --

01:01:58.714 --> 01:01:59.849
I WOULD SAY LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.085
GENERAL ENFORCEMENT IN GENERAL

AND SO ON IN THERE ARE TWO

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:08.124
ISSUES THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:08.758
THAT.

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.460
ANY SCHOOL IS TRYING TO PROMOTE

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:12.795
ITSELF OF FOR PROFIT GAIN

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:14.697
WHETHER IT WOULD BE BUT THERE IS

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:15.631

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:17.133
ACTUAL JOB T THE OTHER END

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.868
THAT'S NUMBER ONE AND THE AND

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.837
THE CALVET THE VETERAN.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:21.771
WHO'S USING HIS --

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:24.774
GI BILL TO OBTAIN IS EDUCATION --

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.242
HOW ARE YOU WORKING TO MAKE SURE

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:28.044
THAT'S PROTECTED GOOD THAT

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:29.245
FEDERAL STATE?

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:31.280
AND THESE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:32.348
YOUNG VETERANS.

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:33.516
YOU GUYS ARE ALL BRING ENOUGH

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:34.884
GREAT QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS IS

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.986
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:40.690
INTO BECAUSE REMEMBER.

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:41.924
CAL VET IS A SEPARATE

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.926
ORGANIZATION TO BE PP WHICH THEY

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:45.761
OPERATE UNDER DIFFERENT LAWS AND

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.296
WE OPERATE UNDER SO THEY MAY BE

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:50.266
ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ON GI BILLS.

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.635
THAT MAY NOT FALL WITHIN THE

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.036
PURVIEW OF THE BUREAU.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:56.105
AND SO THIS IS ANOTHER AREA THAT

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.273
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN MY

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.509
OPINION BECAUSE IT AS OBVIOUSLY

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:01.043
WE WANT O BOTH TAKE ACTION AT

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.211
THE SAME TIME BUT THE WAY THAT

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:03.312
OUR LAWS ARE STRUCTURED DON'T

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.680
ALLOW FOR US TO DO THAT.

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.115
RIGHT IT'S SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.784
IS WORK TOGETHER --

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.019
WITH CAL DATING YOU I'M SURE

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:11.387
YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT WHEN

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:12.054
SCOTT COMES UP TO TALK ABOUT --

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.257
SAR BUT ONCE AGAIN THE WAY THAT

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:15.992
OUR LAW WAS OR SUCH THEY MAY BE

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.627
A TAKE ACTION BEFORE WE AT MAKE

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:19.395
TAKE ACTION BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:21.097
PART.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:23.266
IT MAY NOT REACH THE LEVEL TO

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:24.600
OUR LAW.

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.434
BUT I WOULD THINK WE WOULD HAVE

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:27.069
A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY --

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:29.906
IF YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF A

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.807
PENDING PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE AN

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:33.409
OBLIGATION TO THE STUDENTS STATE

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:35.945
A CALIFORNIA --

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.880
DID TO BE POINTED OUT AND THERE

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:38.381
SHOULD BE A PROCESS AND

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.616
PROCEDURE TO NOTIFY THE ENTITY

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:42.318
EVEN THOUGH IT'S OUT OF STATE.

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.153
OR WHEREVER IT MIGHT BE THAT

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.922
SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN OR

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:48.157
HAS HAPPENED AND IT MAY JUST

AGAIN IT'S THE STUDENT WHO IS

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:52.261

THE MAJORITY OF MY LIFE.

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:58.834
IN BEING ABLE TO NOT TAKE ACTION

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.503
IN SEE THESE THINGS OCCUR IS ONE

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.639
OF THE HARDEST THINGS THAT I'VE

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:04.707
HAD IN THIS ROLE.

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.876

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:12.081
SO.

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:13.816
WE CAN WORK ON SOME OF THE

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:14.951
ISSUES YOU HAVE WITH NOT BEING

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.018
ABLE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.720
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW BUT LET'S

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:19.155
GO BACK TO WHAT YOU DO HAVE

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:20.723
DIRECT CONTROL OVER --

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.391
HE SAID WHEN YOU FIRST TOOK OVER

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.693
THAT THERE WERE SOME ENFORCEMENT

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:25.561
CHALLENGES WHAT WERE THOSE

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:26.429
CHALLENGES.

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.364
I WOULD SAY THE FIRST THE FIRST

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:29.632
THING WAS STAFFING.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:30.866

WE WERE RECEIVING TRAINER BUT I

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.475

BE A ONGOING THING TO BE QUITE

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:41.978
HONEST.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.112
AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:44.547

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:47.283
POSITIONS THAT SPECIALIZE IN

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:48.918
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS I THINK

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:50.219
THAT'S GOING TO BE A GAME

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:50.820

INVESTIGATORS ARE INVESTIGATING

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:40.089
IF THERE'S EVER ANYTHING THAT

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:41.657
STANDS OUT SOMETIMES WHEN WE

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:42.992
USED INVESTIGATE GRIEVANCES WE

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:43.859

SOMETHING HAPPENING.

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:46.829
THAT WE WEREN'T AWARE OF AND SO

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.464
THEN IT WOULD CAUSE US TO DO OUR

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:50.499
OWN INVESTIGATION SO DO YOU EVER

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:51.600
HAVE A STUDENT COME TO MAKE A

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.269
COMPLAINT THAT YOU FIND SO

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.336

SCHOOL YES SO ONE OF THE THINGS

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:58.707
THAT WILL BE DOING MOVING

01:07:58.774 --> 01:07:59.975

SCHOOLS ARE DOING IT PROPERLY.

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:21.997
QUESTION RECALL RIGHT YES DIDN'T

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.165
MENTION THAT --

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:26.235
CURRENT LAWS DO ALLOW THE BUREAU --

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:27.203
TO GO ROUTE OF AN EMERGENCY

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:29.138
ORDER IF IN FACT WE BELIEVE THE

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.639
STUDENT IS IN IMMINENT.

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:35.411
DANGER ARE OKAY VERY GOOD BUT

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.913
YOU COULD DO IF A STATE AN OUT

OF STATE SCHOOL THAT ALSO

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.683
OPERATES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:42.751
HAD BEEN SOMETHING FRAUDULENT

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.954
HAD DONE SOMETHING TO STUDENTS

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.022
IN ANOTHER STATE YOU COULD TAKE

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:48.858

SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.831

WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THE STUDENTS

01:09:03.472 --> 01:09:04.507
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.509
FRUSTRATION UP HERE THAT YOU

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:07.610
KNOW THE LAW WON'T LET US DO IT

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:08.644
THE LAW WON'T LET US DO IT.

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:10.179
WHAT CAN YOU DO RIGHT SO I THINK

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.413
WHICH CHU I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.549

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:22.825
BEEN THERE THAT WE'RE MAKING A

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:23.692
CHANGE.

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:25.194
BUT THEY'RE ALSO THINGS AS I

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.028
MENTIONED EARLIER THAT ARE

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.429
LIMITING US IN BEING ABLE TO DO

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:28.464
THAT AND WHICH IS WHY I'M HAPPY

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:33.569
AND I BROUGHT IT HERE IN SO WE

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.538

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.744
I I GUESS Và MY UNDERSTANDING

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:42.745
OF THE LAW THAT IS A LITTLE BIT

01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:43.379
DIFFERENT THAN YOURS AND I WANT

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:43.979

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:48.784
RELIEF.

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.386
AND IN THAT IT SAYS THAT THE

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:51.954
DUTIES OF THAT OFFICER WE'RE

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:53.222
GOING TO HEAR FROM THE DIRECTOR

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:54.690
JUST A MOMENT SO I LOOK FOR TO

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:56.525

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.304
THAT'S PART OF THE DUTIES.

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:10.706
OKAY IS TO SEE PROBLEMS AND LET

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:11.907
STUDENTS BE AWARE OF THOSE

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:12.908
PROBLEMS.

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:13.576
SO I THINK THAT --

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:16.211
I THINK EVEN LOOKING WITH

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:17.713
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT EXIST IN

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.448

YOU HAVE THAT ABILITY NOW IN MY

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:22.084
OPINION.

MORE PROACTIVE IN THESE AREAS

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.390
IT'S A PART OF THE CHARGE TO

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:29.558
THAT OFFICE.

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:30.626
AND I THINK IT'S A PART OF YOUR

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:31.961
RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK YOU

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:33.696
WOULD SAW THAT IN THE STEPS THAT

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.164
WE TOOK IN ARGOSY.

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.499
AND HERE RECENTLY BECAUSE ONCE

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:39.234
AGAIN I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WE

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:41.403
HAVE TO BASED ON THE LAW THAT WE

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:42.338
HAVE.

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.106
IT APPEARS FROM OUR FROM OUR

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:47.142
LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS TO ME IS

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:48.277
THAT THEY'RE VERY LIMITING A

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:49.645
STEP THAT WE TAKE BUT IN THE

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:52.247
ARGOSY CASE WHAT WE DID DO IS WE

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:53.616
DID SEND OUT.

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:55.684
OUR SO OUR STAFF AND OUR BUREAU

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:58.487
STAFF TO THESE INSTITUTIONS IN

01:10:58.554 --> 01:10:59.588
PROVIDED WITH AND PROVIDE

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.123
INFORMATION BUT WE HAVE TO BE

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.025
VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WE DOING THAT

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.760
WERE WALKING THE THIN LINE.

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:06.095
AND FOR ME I DON'T WHAT I DON'T

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:07.630
WANT TO DO IS PUT THE THE BUREAU

01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:09.431
IN JEOPARDY.

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:10.165
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M A

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:11.800
STUDENT CENTERED ADMINISTRATOR

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.102
NOT BEEN THAT MY WHOLE LIFE AND

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:15.070
SO BEST BELIEVE IF THERE'S WAYS

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:16.739
AND ACTIONS I CAN TAKE.

SCHOOL --

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:35.082

WE ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO TAKE A

01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:37.785

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:41.422
PAGE BUT BUT IN IN IN YOUR

01:37:41.488 --> 01:37:42.923
EXAMPLE YES THAT COULD

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.625
POTENTIALLY TAKE THEM.

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:46.560
OUTSIDE OF STATE AS WELL --

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:48.429
I CAN THINK OF ONE I CAN ONLY DO

01:37:48.495 --> 01:37:50.130
ONE PERSONAL EXAMPLE OFF THE TOP

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:51.999
OF MY HEAD IN THE MOMENT BUT I

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:54.935
IT ONE OF THE CAL TAP THE VINCE --

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:56.804
THE THE THE WITH QUE VETERANS

LOOKING AT USING THEIR G. I.

01:37:58.138 --> 01:38:01.875
pWITH THE STUDENT THAT WAS

LOOKING AT A SCHOOL IN IOWA.

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:06.747
AND ABOUT THEIR ACCREDITATION IN

01:38:06.814 --> 01:38:07.848
THEIR PROFESSIONAL ACCREDITATION

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:09.183
STANDARDS IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:10.851

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:11.819
PROGRAM.

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:14.488
AND THE DISCUSSION IN REAL TIME

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:16.523
JUST TIONS WHERE THEY WERE OTHER

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:19.827
STATES AND SO I AGREE WITH YOU I

01:38:19.893 --> 01:38:22.329
I FALL I I FIND THAT TO BE UNDER

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:24.031
THE STARR'S PURVIEW BECAUSE IT

01:42:34.414 --> 01:42:38.085
INCLUDING HEIGHTENED CASH BEING

01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:38.719
ONE OF THE WORST ONES BUT THERE

01:42:38.785 --> 01:42:39.286
ARE OTHERS.

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:40.921
EXCUSE ME THEIR OTHER STATUSES

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.756

ENFORCEMENT --

01:42:45.225 --> 01:42:46.660
UNIT IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:47.794
UNITS --

01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:49.329
ATTRACT THOSE IT IS THIS BEFORE

01:42:49.396 --> 01:42:51.064
THE FACT YOU'RE AFTER THE FACT

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:51.932
THIS IS BEFORE.

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:52.799
VERY GOOD THAT'S HAT'S

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:54.501
IMPORTANT TO NOW FINALLY LET ME

01:42:54.568 --> 01:42:55.903
ASK YOU ABOUT THE STUDENT

01:42:55.969 --> 01:42:57.104
TUITION RECOVERY FIND.

01:42:57.170 --> 01:42:58.572
I HOW HOW MUCH IS CURRENTLY IN

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:01.408
THAT FUD ARTS APPROXIMATELY

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:02.409
TWENTY SIX MILLION TWENTY FIVE

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:03.911
POINT SOMETHING MILLION.

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:05.879
AT OTHER CAPS UNDER LEGISLATION

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:07.514
AS TO WHAT AT A WE ARE AT THOSE

01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:09.016
CAP LEVELS WE ARE.

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:10.117
AND IS THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:11.618
TODAY THAT WERE CAPPING THE

01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:12.653
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S GOING

01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:13.854
INTO THIS FIND.

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:14.788
IT DOES -- I

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:16.189
WOULD SAY THAT'S A VERY DYNAMIC

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:17.324
THING IN AND SOMETHING TO REALLY

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:19.026
KEEP OUR EYES ON WITH EACH THREE

01:43:19.092 --> 01:43:21.295
LARGE CLOSURES THAT WE JUST HAVE

01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:21.995
TALKED ABOUT TODAY HAVE NOT

01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:23.263
HAVEN'T --

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:24.231
REALLY --

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:28.001
HIT THAT YET --

01:43:28.068 --> 01:43:29.236
I I ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:32.573
PACKED WHETHER THE CAP IS

01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:33.707
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE TRACKING

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:34.875
CLOSELY --

01:43:34.942 --> 01:43:35.676
BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE AN

01:43:35.742 --> 01:43:38.145
IMPACT ON ON THE INSTITUTIONS --

01:43:38.211 --> 01:43:39.613
AND AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.382
THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS BUT I

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:43.116
THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'RE SOLID

01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:43.884
RIGHT NOW.

01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:44.851
IT WILL I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:46.954
ANY ANY REGULATIONS YOU THINK OR

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.388
TOO CONSTRICTING.

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:50.223
THAT WE SHOULD RE EVALUATE GIVEN

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:51.425
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKET

01:43:51.491 --> 01:43:53.794
PLACE GETTING GIVEN HOW MANY

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:54.628
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN POTENTIALLY

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:55.729
HURT -- BY

01:43:55.796 --> 01:43:56.897
THESE CLOSURES I THINK MY

01:43:56.964 --> 01:43:58.799
COLLEAGUES WOULD BE OPEN MINDED

01:43:58.865 --> 01:44:00.000
TO THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:01.101
BETTER PROTECT THOSE STUDENTS

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:02.603
AND IF WE HAVE A STATUTORY CAP

01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:03.470
ON A FIND.

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:04.638
AT THIS GOING TO LIMIT OUR

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:06.273
ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIVE I THINK

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:09.409
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT.

01:44:09.476 --> 01:44:10.010
AND WE APPRECIATE THAT OUT OF

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:10.944
JAIL.

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:11.678
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT'S

01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:12.913
HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.481
YOU TALK ABOUT THE SCHOOLS THAT

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:16.183
HAVE CLOSER ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:17.918
HUNDRED STUDENTS IN EACH SCHOOL

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:19.086
AND I THINK YOU SAID THAT YOU

01:44:19.152 --> 01:44:21.788
HAD SOME IN PERSON MEETINGS HAVE --

01:44:21.855 --> 01:44:24.024
AND REACH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:25.125
SEVENTY FIVE STUDENTS THE MORE

01:44:25.192 --> 01:44:26.226
THAN THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:27.828
WAS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THAT

01:44:27.894 --> 01:44:28.929
ACTUALLY ATTENDED THE OKAY THE

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.697
WORKSHOPS THAT THAT TWO HUNDRED

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:32.232
WHATEVER NUMBER IT WAS WAS.

01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:34.534
A CLAIMS FILED TO DATE FLETCHER.

01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:36.403
SO THE TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS IT

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:38.238
DIDN'T COME IN PERSON DO YOU

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:39.706
HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR INFORMATION

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:40.540
TO THE YOU COULD SEND THEM A

01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:42.643
LETTER WE DO YEAH WE DO IN THIS

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:43.276
CASE.

01:44:43.343 --> 01:44:46.680
QUITE SPEAKING VERY FRANKLY.

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:49.483
AS BAD IN AND IN AND FORTUNATE

01:44:49.549 --> 01:44:51.051
AND AND HAS MANY NEGATIVE THINGS

01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:52.786
THAT CAME OUT OF THE CA CLOSURES

01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:54.454
ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS --

01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:56.356
WAS THAT THEY PROVIDED VERY --

01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:59.493
THOROUGH A TIMELY ROSTERS --

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:00.093
WELL BEFORE THE CLOSURE AND I

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.963
REALLY THING WE NEEDED IN TERMS

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:05.198
OF CONTACT INFORMATION A NON

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:06.800
SCHOOL ISSUE EMAILS PHONE

01:45:06.867 --> 01:45:08.135
NUMBERS.

01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:09.836
PROGRAM SO WE GOT ALL THAT OF

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:11.605
THE REASON THAT NUMBER SO LARGE

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:12.606
AS WELL -- I

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:13.874
I BELIEVEDEBBIE MENTION OR IT

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:14.641
MAY HAVE BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:15.308
THAT.

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:17.044
WE CONSIDER IN CALCULATING

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:18.779
QUANTIFY IN THAT IMPACTED NUMBER

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:20.847
STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED WITHIN

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:21.415
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:22.983
CLOSURE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:24.751
THIS JEFF ELIGIBILITY WORKS --

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:26.553
SO THERE WASN'T NECESSARILY

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.154
TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS

01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:27.988
ENROLLED ON THE DAY OF THE

01:45:28.055 --> 01:45:30.724
CLOSURE BUT AND SO MANY OF THEM --

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.225
ARE ARE THOSE WHO'VE COMPLETED

01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:33.326
EARLIER A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:34.761
DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN.

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:36.229
BUT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WE

01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:37.631
WE USE ALL THOSE METHODS OF

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:38.699
COMMUNICATION TO REACH OUT WITH

01:45:38.765 --> 01:45:42.536
THEM QUITE FRANKLY SOCIAL MEDIA

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:43.704
OFTEN BEING THE MOST EFFECTIVE.

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:44.738
AGREE GOOD THAT'S WHAT I WAS

01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:46.106

BORN AND RAISED CALIFORNIA AND

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:49.596
WAS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:51.398
AND THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION

01:47:51.464 --> 01:47:52.532
WORKING ON HIGHER EDUCATION

01:47:52.599 --> 01:47:54.067
POLICY -- I

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:55.335
WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING

01:47:55.402 --> 01:47:57.270
THIS HEARING TODAY I THINK IS --

01:47:57.337 --> 01:47:59.973
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.675
CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN --

01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:03.977
POORLY TREATED BY BY COLLEGES

01:48:04.044 --> 01:48:05.512
AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING IN THE

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:06.847
RIGHT DIRECTION OF THINKING

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:08.315
ABOUT HOW CAN WE HELP THE

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:10.150
STUDENTS WHO WERE HARMED AND HOW

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:11.618
WE CAN PREVENT THIS FROM

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:13.286
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE --

01:48:13.353 --> 01:48:16.323
SENATOR LABOR YOU ASKED ABOUT --

01:48:16.389 --> 01:48:17.457
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE COMMON

01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:18.959
ELEMENTS OF SOME OF THESE

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:21.595
CLOSURES AND I WANTED TO PROVIDE --

01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:22.562
ONE ONE ANSWER TO THAT WHICH

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:24.231
MIGHT BE A SIGNAL. FOR SOME OF

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:25.599
THE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE

01:48:25.665 --> 01:48:26.900
AROUND PREVENTION --

01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:28.568
THE CALAMITOUS CLOSURES WHERE

01:48:28.635 --> 01:48:30.604
THEIR SUDDEN AND LOTS AND LOTS

01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:32.672
OF STUDENTS TEND TO HAVE A

01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:34.674
COUPLE OF ELEMENTS TO THEM ONE

01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:37.677
IS THAT THEY TEND TO BE COLLEGES.

01:48:37.744 --> 01:48:38.778
BETTER FOCUSED ALMOST

01:48:38.845 --> 01:48:40.747
EXCLUSIVELY ON ROLLING PEOPLE

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:43.149
WITH FINANCIAL AID AND THE

01:48:43.216 --> 01:48:44.551
REASON THAT HALF OF THE REASON

01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:46.386
THEIR THAT HAPPENS IS THAT THEY

01:48:46.453 --> 01:48:48.655
ARE AVOIDING ANY INTERACTION

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:50.357
WHERE THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY MAKE

01:48:50.423 --> 01:48:53.260
THE VALUE CASE OF THE THE KIND

01:48:53.326 --> 01:48:54.494
OF WHAT WHAT WOULD BE A NORMAL.

01:48:54.561 --> 01:48:57.530
VALUE CASE FOR THE THE THE VALUE

01:48:57.597 --> 01:48:59.266
OF THE DEGREE FOR THE MONEY

01:48:59.332 --> 01:49:01.401
INSTEAD THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:02.936
ACCREDITED WERE APPROVED BY THE

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:04.704
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE'S MONEY

01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:06.306
AVAILABLE AND LETTING THE

01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:08.275
STUDENT ASSUME THAT.

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:10.744
THE PRICE MUST BE OKAY WITH THE

01:49:10.810 --> 01:49:12.612
GOVERNMENT OR ELSE THEY WOULD

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:14.681
NOT ALLOW THEM TO GET THAT MONEY

01:49:14.748 --> 01:49:16.483
AND THEY LOAD THEM UP WITH.

01:49:16.549 --> 01:49:18.818
THEIR WITH WITH THE PELL GRANT

01:49:18.885 --> 01:49:21.888
WITH AND ROLLING IN FOR A

01:49:21.955 --> 01:49:24.691
LENGTHY PERIOD STUDENT THINKS

01:49:24.758 --> 01:49:25.558
THEY'RE GETTING A QUALITY

01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:28.194
EDUCATION AND THEY DON'T REALIZE

01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:29.863
TILL THEY TRY TO GET A JOB THAT

01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:31.231
THAT IT'S NOT RELATE.

01:49:31.298 --> 01:49:32.832
YOU NOT NOT RELATE THAT SERVING

01:49:32.899 --> 01:49:35.602
THEM THE OTHER ELEMENT OF IT IS

01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:37.637
THAT THOSE INSTITUTIONS I WAS

01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:38.772
THINKING ABOUT THIS WHEN DR

01:49:38.838 --> 01:49:40.006
MARION TALKED ABOUT THE FIX THAT

01:49:40.073 --> 01:49:41.241
TICKET --

01:49:41.308 --> 01:49:43.009
AND AND HOW YOU KNOW THIS IN A

01:49:43.076 --> 01:49:44.778
LOT OF THESE SITUATIONS THAT'S

01:49:44.844 --> 01:49:45.745
NOT GOING TO THAT'S NOT GOING TO

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:46.313
BE.

01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:48.248
ENOUGH BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:49.783
SITUATIONS ARE WHERE.

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:52.419

01:49:52.485 --> 01:49:53.687
IS.

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:56.690
HAS A ROLE WHERE THEIR ROLE IS

01:49:56.756 --> 01:49:58.558
EXTRACTING MONEY FROM THAT

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:00.527
KNOWLEDGE SO RATHER THAN HAVING

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:02.195
THE AGENTS AND TRUSTEES.

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:04.164
WHO ARE OVERSEEING THE COLLEGE

01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:05.665
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A GIVE

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:07.434

THEIR TIME DONATING MONEY THEY

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:10.470
WANTED TO BE A GREAT COLLEGE

01:50:10.537 --> 01:50:11.705

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.154
MEANS.

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:30.123
THERE'S A MOMENT IN TIME WHEN A

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:33.159
SCHOOL IS WHEN WHEN THE PEOPLE

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:34.561
INSIDE THE SCHOOL KNOW.

01:50:34.627 --> 01:50:36.696
THAT THE SHIP IS GOING DOWN BUT

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:38.198
NOBODY ON THE OUTSIDE KNOWS

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.165
ABOUT IT.
