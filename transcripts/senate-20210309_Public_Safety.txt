SENATE EGGMAN OF IF YOU'RE READY WE'RE READY FOR SB THREE TWENTY WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING AND IT IS A IT IS MY HONOR TO PRESENT MY VERY FIRST BILL IN THE SENATE THIS MORNING- TODAY I AM PRESENTING SB THREE TWENTY A BILL THAT SEEKS TO BETTER PROTECT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE FROM GUN VIOLENCE. SB THREE TWENTY ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY. ONE CODIFYING CALIFORNIA RULE OF COURT FIVE POINT FOUR NINE FIVE WHICH CREATED A JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT PROCESS TO ENSURE FIRE ARMS THAT HAVE BECOME PROHIBITED. AS A RESULT OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER ARE ACTUALLY RELINQUISHED AT THE EARLY SOME OF THE POSSIBLE. AND TO IT REQUIRES THE COURT TO COMMUNICATE THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT FAILURES TO RELINQUISH THESE WEAPONS WHICH WILL ASSIST IN PREVENTING. ANGELI DEADLY ESCALATION OF GUN VIOLENCE IN ALREADY VOLATILE SITUATIONS IN CALIFORNIA 33% OF WOMEN AND 72% 27% OF MEN EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DURING THEIR LIFETIME. WE KNOW THAT THE PRESENCE OF A FIREARM IN THE HOME AND DURING AN INCIDENT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCREASES THE RISK OF HOMICIDE BY AT LEAST OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY FIREARM RELATED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. EVEN WITH THE STATE'S ROBUST COMPREHENSIVE BYRON LEGISLATION RECOVERING PROHIBITED FIREARMS IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. AND DATA FROM THE ARMED PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM SHOWS THAT THERE ARE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WHOARE PROHIBITED BUT WHO HAVE FAILED TO RELINQUISH THEIR WEAPONS AND KEEP IN MIND THIS IS ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE REGISTERED GUNS. BECAUSE THE RULE OF COURT SB THREE TWENTY IS CODIFYING HAS BEEN OPTIONAL. OVERSIGHT A FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT IN THE CIVIL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONTEXT IS INCONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE AND THE BURDEN OFTEN FALLS ON THE SURVIVOR TO REQUEST THAT THE COURT APPLY ITS OWN ROLE. AND CONFIRM THAT PROHIBITED FIRE ARMS HAVE BEEN RELINQUISHED. WE KNOW BETWEEN SIXTY AND 90% OF FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE SELF REPRESENTED. AND HAVE TO NAVIGATE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BY THEMSELVES. SB THREE TWENTY ACKNOWLEDGES THIS FACT AND MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE BEST ENTITY TO STEP IN AND MAKE SURE FIRE ARMS OR RELINQUISHED. AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT IS THE COURT. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH US TODAY. THE FIRST IS JULIA WEBER THE IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTOR GIFFORDS LAW CENTER 2% PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE WHO ARE ALSO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND ALISON CAP PART THE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES THAT WE'VE WHO IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER PROCESS. WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. US WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ACTUALLY PUTTING A PART IN PLACE A PROCESS TO ACTUALLY. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER AND HAVE A WEAPON ARE SUPPOSED TO RELINQUISH IT. DOESN'T USUALLY HAPPEN. SO WE'RE PROVIDING A PROCESS FOR THAT FOR THE COURT TO DO THAT AND ALSO TO COMMUNICATE TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE. THANK YOU SENATOR GRAHAM YOUR FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF YOUR YOUR WEBER ARE YOU PREPARED TO TESTIFY AT THIS POINT. I AM WHEN YOU'RE READY TO HEAR ARGUMENT CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME. OKAY GREAT GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JULIA WEBER I THE IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTOR AT DIFFERENT LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE SPONSOR OF SB THREE TWENTY. I'M AN ATTORNEY IN SAN FRANCISCO EACH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHY GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY AND I SERVE AS AN EXPERT WITNESS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES. I'M APPEARING TODAY ON BEHALF OF GIFFORD. I'VE WORKED IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIELD FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS INCLUDING SEVENTEEN YEARS WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHERE I WORKED ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD CUSTODY. INCLUDING DEVELOPING RULES SUCH AS THE ONE SB THREE TWENTY IS BASED ON. I'VE ALSO WORKED WITH POST ON TRADING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ON PROMISING PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING FIREARM PROHIBITIONS. SB THREE TWENTY WILL ELEVATE THE IMPORTANT ROLE% OUR COURTS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES PLAY IN ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS. IT WILL HELP INSURE THOSE WHO ARE PROHIBITED FROM HAVING FIREARMS WILL RELINQUISH THEM AS CLOSE TO THE TIME OF PROHIBITION AS POSSIBLE. CHALDEA JAY'S ARMS PROHIBITED PERSONS LEGISLATIVE REPORT HAS CONSISTENTLY RECOMMENDED THAT CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTED PROHIBITION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN THEY ARE IMPOSED MOST RECENTLY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FIREARMS. AS AN AREA IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT STATEWIDE IN CIVIL RESTRAINING ORDER PROCEEDINGS WERE MOSTLY BEGINS ARE REPRESENTING THEMSELVES IT IS CRUCIAL THAT SURVIVORS BRING INFORMATION ABOUT FIREARMS TO THE COURT'S ATTENTION RECEIVE THE PROTECTION THE LAW PROVIDES. INCLUDING REDUCING FIRE ARMS RISKS WHICH IS WHY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ENACTED THE RULE OF COURT INITIALLY. FOR THESE PROHIBITIONS TO BE EFFECTIVE RESTRAINT PARTIES NEED TO BE GIVEN LOCAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO COMPLY TO INCREASE SAFETY FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE PUBLIC. I SENATOR AG IS NOTED THE PRESENCE OF FIREARMS IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS INCREASES THE RISK OF LETHAL OUTCOMES FOR FEMALE INTIMATE PARTNER VICTIMS BY 5100% MORE THAN ONE MILLION WOMEN ALIVE TODAY HAVE BEEN SHOT OR SHOT AT BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER AND THIS DOESN'T BEGIN TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MANY WAYS FIREARMS ARE USED TO COURSE OF WE CONTROL PARTNERS. WELL WE HAVE STATEWIDE COURT FORMS THAT EXPLAIN TO RESTRAIN PARTIES HOW THEY CAN COMPLY WE DON'T YET HAVE PROTOCOLS THAT MAKE THESE LAWS MOST AFFECTED BY ENSURING THE PERSON WHO MUST RELINQUISH FIREARMS ACTUALLY DOES SO. SB THREE TWENTY WILL CHANGE THAT AND PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY VIOLENCE PREVENTION AGENCIES. TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS KEY COMPONENT OF RISK REDUCTION. THESE ARE TRUSTED PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP SUPPORT COMPLIANCE. WHEN INDIVIDUALS DON'T COMPLY WITH CIVIL RESTRAINING ORDER FIREARM PROHIBITIONS LAW ALREADY PROVIDES FOR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. BUT BECAUSE THESE ARE CIVIL CASES TOO OFTEN THIS INFORMATION IS NOT PROVIDED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT CREATING POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE AVOIDED. SB THREE TWENTY WILL CHANGE THAT AND BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT AND LIFE SAVING POLICY WE URGE YOU TO VOTE AYE AND SB THREE TWENTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MISS WEBB WHO WERE UP. WHOEVER I'M SORRY HI ALISON GEPHARDT. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALICE AND CAPARO I AM THE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES WITH WEEDS I AGAIN I THINK VIOLENCE AND CRACKLE ABOUT SERVICES AGENCY IN SACRAMENTO I AM ALSO A PRACTICING FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY I THINK PROVIDE A STAFF OF THREE OTHER THAN A LOT OF TURNING.

WE'VE SUPPORT SB THREE TWENTY AS IT WILL IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO ARE SEEKING PROTECTION FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN VIA FAMILY COURT DOMESTIC VIOLENCERESTRAINING ORDER PROCEEDING WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL IMPROVE SAFETY FOR MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A RESULT OF THE COMMUNICATION. THAT WILL HAPPEN BETWEEN THE FAMILY COURT AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IF THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DVR- PROCESS AND HOW IT IMPACTS SURVIVORS I'M HAPPY TO TRY TO ADDRESS.

EITHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF DYING AT THE HANDS OF AN INTIMATE PARTNER FOR IT OR SOME OTHER STATS THAT WOULD INDICATE WHY IT IS SO ESSENTIAL TO- TO MAKE SURE THAT FIREARMS ARE RETRIEVED FROM THESE A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- I DON'T HAVE THE OVERALL STASHED WE KNOW IF THERE'S A GUN IN THE HOUSE IT INCREASES THE CHANCE BY 5100% BY 10% IF A GUN IS IT BUT FOR THE FOR THE- THE PERSON WHO HAS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSAULT AT. RESTRAINING ORDER BUT THAT ALSO DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO OFTENTIMES ARE HARMED BY THESE WEAPONS STAYING IN THE HANDS WE HAD AN- EXAMPLE OF THAT. TWO YEARS AGO IN SACRAMENTO WHEN SOMEBODY HAD A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER THEY WERE ON THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LAST WHEN THE POLICE SHOWED UP AN OFFICER WAS SHOT AND KILLED AT THAT TIME- I DON'T HAVE THE- APPRECIATE THAT INFO I DON'T HAVE THAT- DATA DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME BUT- IT'S ACTUALLY. ARE QUITE SIGNIFICANT- ESPECIALLY AMONGST WOMEN- OF. THE WOMAN'S. DEATH IS. IT LIKE DISPROPORTIONATELY. LIKELY TO BE AS A RESULT OF AN INTIMATE PARTNER MURDER. THEN THAN ANY OTHER. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ALSO HAS HIGH INCIDENCE OF ON. FIVE THE WEAPON DISCHARGED NOT FROM THEM SO MUCH BUT FROM THEIR INTERVENTIONS IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES IT'S QUITE DANGEROUS EVEN FOR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY NECESSARY BILL AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING FORWARD AND WANT OTHER FOLKS ABOUT THEIR QUESTIONS- CHAIR I'M WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS. NINETEEN NINE. SENATOR AGAIN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD JUST APPRECIATE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS VERY COMMONSENSE MEASURE TO GET THE GUNS OUT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THEM AND I DON'T HAVE ALREADY PROVED THEMSELVES TO BE AT RISK OF HARMING A POTENTIALLY KILLING OTHERS- AND HANDED THE VICTIM SHOULD NOT BE THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING THAT WEAPON WE PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

WIENER I'D FOUR ZERO FOUR ZERO ON THE CONSENT THAT MEASURES DISPENSED WITH NOW WE'RE MOVING BACK TO OPEN UP THE ROLE ON. ON THE RULES APPROVAL OF THE COMMITTEE RULES AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL OUT TO MEMBERS WIENER. WIENER AYE FOUR ZERO FOUR ZERO FAT MEASURES CONCERTS DISPENSE WOOD NOW WE'RE MOVING BACK TO SB SIXTEEN CENTER SKINNER WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED. THANK YOU SO MUCH- YOUR CHAIR AND- MEMBERS S. B. C. SORRY SB SIXTEEN. IS A REINTRODUCTION OF MY BILL LAST YEAR SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WHICH MADE IT ON THE FLOOR OF THE ASSEMBLY WITH A FIFTY FOUR VOTES I BELIEVE. AND BUT DUE TO IT BEING THE END OF SESSION AND A HARD STOP MIDNIGHT DEADLINE. AND BILLS HAVING A DELAY GETTING FROM THE ASSEMBLY TO THE SENATE IT NEVER REACHED THE SENATE FLOOR SO WE WERE UNABLE TO VOTE ON IT- WILD ONE CANNOT WHY COULD NOT A SEARCH WITH ALL. BUT- HE COMPLETED- S. CERTAINTY THAT IT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A SIMILAR RESPONSE ON THE SENATE FLOOR I FEEL THAT- GIVEN THE VOTE IN THE ASSEMBLY IT LIKELY WHATEVER- NOW INDEPENDENT OF THAT WE'VE GOT IT BEFORE US TODAY. SO WHAT S. B. SIXTEEN DOES IS IT EXPANDS UPON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BILL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH I AUTHORED IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED. AND THAT BILL WAS THE FIRST TIME IN OVER FORTY YEARS THAT CALIFORNIA OPENED UP TO PUBLIC ACCESS. RECORDS AROUND CERTAIN TYPES OF POLICE MISCONDUCT NOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS THEY HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB AMONGST MANY OF OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS. AND THEIR ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB IS BASED ON COMMUNITY TRUST. WHEN THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT FEEL TRUSTFUL OVERCONFIDENT ABOUT THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN FOR EXAMPLE BEING WILLING TO BE A WITNESS TO A CRIME REPORTING A CRIME OR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. SO IT IS REALLY ESSENTIAL TO BUILD THE COMMUNITY TRUST. AND TRANSPARENCY OR SUNSHINE ASSISTS US IN DOING SO AND TO HAVE OVER FORTY YEARS OF BASICALLY NO ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET ACCESS TO RECORDS ON POLICE MISCONDUCT WAS REALLY A TRAVESTY AND WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS THE US. IT WE WERE AN OUT LIAR NOW THAT BILL WAS VERY IMPORTANT WAS GOOD BUT IT WAS VERY VERY LIMITED AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS BAD TO OUR ABILITY TO GET THAT PUBLIC INFORMATION AND I WILL ADD THAT OUR- PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WHICH AFFECTS EVERY OTHER. PUBLIC EMPLOYEE GIVES MUCH MUCH MORE RECORDS IN INFO SO WHAT IS SIXTEEN SPECIFICALLY DO IT ADDS TO CURRENT LAW BY ALLOWING. US TO GET RECORDS ON. FORCE THAT- I'M REASONABLE. THAT IS BEYOND JUST SHOOTING OF A WEAPON SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT- UNREASONABLE FORCE IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO GET RECORDS ON OFFICERS WHO HAVE A- DEMONSTRATED. BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR. OFFICERS WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN UNLAWFUL ARRESTS AND SEARCHES. OFFICES WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN CERTAIN DISHONESTY SUCH AS FRAMING PEOPLE. AND IT ADDITIONALLY REQUIRES THAT. WHEN AN OFFICER LEAVES AN AGENCY IF AN INVESTIGATION AND NOT A COMPLAINT ON THAT OFFICERS NOT COMPLETED THE RECORD IS STILL MAINTAINED. AND IF THE OFFICER REPLIES TO ANOTHER AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA THAT AGENCY MUST REQUEST ALL PERSONAL RECORDS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS THAT WE HAVE SEEN. THAT SOME AGENCIES OR OFFICERS HAVE TRIED TO GET AWAY WITH NOT HAVING A RECORD ESTABLISHED BY JUST LEAVING THEIR AGENCY QUITTING. BEFORE AN INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETE NOW FINALLY WHAT THE BILL DOES IS AFTER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE PASSED. WE FOUND THAT MANY AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE WERE VERY COOPERATIVE RELEASED RECORDS UPON REQUEST BUT MANY OTHERS DRAGGED THEIR FEET AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LOCALITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. THAT TO THIS DAY. STILL RELEASED EITHER NO RECORDS OR VERY FEW RECORDS UNDER SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY. IN FIVE. THE COUNTRY TO THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW SO WHAT TIS BILL DOES IS PUT A TIME CERTAIN ON THE RELEASE OF RECORDS AND ALSO SOME PENALTIES. TO THE JURISDICTIONS FOR DRAGGING THEIR FEET AS AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. NOW WITH THE VERY ORIGINAL BILL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WAS HARD FOUGHT OUR POLICE UNIONS IN ALMOST ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT OPPOSED IT. HOWEVER IN THIS CASE WE HAVE. ON THERE. THERE REALLY IN BETTER CERTAIN. IN THAT OUR POLICE OFFICER GENE FOR EXAMPLE PORAC IS NEUTRAL ON THE BILL OUR HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS ARE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL THE POLICE CHIEF STILL HAVE A PROBLEM THE SHARE OF STILL HAVE A PROBLEM BUT I THINK THE- OVER RIDING. PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS ACTION SHOULD- SHOULD RECOMMEND ARE. PROCEEDING AND THEN I HAVE A COUPLE OF GREAT WITNESSES NATASHA MINSKER- A LAWYER WHO HAS WORKED ON BILLS IN THIS. TAX TYPE AND THEN I ALSO HAVE SHEEPISH JOHNSON KNOWN AS UNCLE BOBBY WHO IS THE UNCLE OF OSCAR GRANT AND HE CAN RELATE HOW HIS FAMILY WAS ABLE TO FINALLY GET RECORDS. AND UNDERSTAND THE FULL EXTENT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SHOOTING OF A OSCAR GRANT THAT NIGHT THAT NEW YEAR'S EVE NIGHT AT THE FRUITVALE BART STATION AND WITH THAT I'LL ASK FOR THE WITNESSES. THANK YOU AS STATED WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES- SPENCER ARE YOU PREPARED TO TESTIFY THIS TIME. YES GOOD MORNING THIS IS NATASHA MINSKER SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF SMART JUSTICE CALIFORNIA. SB SIXTEEN IS A MODEST BILL THAT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE COMMON ROADBLOCKS THAT FAMILY MEMBERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE ENCOUNTERED. IN TRYING TO ACCESS POLICE MISCONDUCT RECORDS UNDER UNDER SKINNER'S PREVIOUS BILL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE SH FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS. ALL RECORD OF POLICE MISCONDUCT WITH HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC. SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE RESTORED THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BY POLICE AS IT BECAME LAW FAMILY MEMBERS RECORDERS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WORKS HARD TO GET ACCESS TO THOSE RECORDS ENCOUNTERED MANY ROADBLOCKS. MANY RECORDS WERE PURCHASED AS LEGAL UNDER EXISTING LAW. RECORD PRODUCTION WAS DELAYED FOR MONTHS EVEN MORE THAN A YEAR BECAUSE THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE MEANS OF FORCING TIMELY PRODUCTION OF THE RECORDS UNDER CURRENT LAW. SHAMLI MEMBERS WERE CHARGED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR QUOTE COPYING. RECORDS THAT ARE MAINTAINED IN DIGITAL FORMAT AND THAT CAN BE REPRODUCED WITH A FEW STROKES OF THE CANE. AN ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE WAS ASSERTED TO BLOCK ACCESS TO BASIC FACTS. AND WITNESS STATEMENTS. SB SIXTEEN REMOVED THESE ROADBLOCKS AND MAKE MEANINGFUL THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT OF ACCESS TO SERIOUS MISCONDUCT INFORMATION. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT IN PASSING SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. SB SIXTEEN WILL ALSO PROVIDE PUBLIC ACCESS TO SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF MISCONDUCT THAT RELATE TO THE INTEGRITY AND FAIRNESS OF POLICING. SPECIFICALLY SIXTEEN PROVIDES PUBLIC ACCESS TO SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF YOUTH FORCE TO SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF UNLAWFUL ARREST OR SEARCH AND TO SUSTAIN FINDINGS OF DISCRIMINATION FOR ACTIVE PROJECTS BY POLICE. THESE KINDS OF MISCONDUCT UNDERMINE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY THEIR LOCAL DEPARTMENT. FINALLY I'M ALSO EXPRESSING SUPPORT TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA. WE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB SIXTEEN A MODEST BILL TO PROMOTE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS MICHAEL BOBBY.

POLICE CONTRABAND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH DEFENCE STAND COUNTER WHETHER TO ISSUE A WARNING OR MAKE AROUND. HOW THEY RESPOND TO A FLEEING SUSPECT HOW THEY RIDE AN ARREST REPORT TO JUSTIFY THIRD ACTION AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL LIE UNDER OATH. WE MUST NOT LET THIS MOMENT PASS WITHOUT SWEEPING.

I SEE WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION JONATHON FELDMAN AND COREY ALESIS SO THE HOLLOW- IS MR FELDMAN PREPARED AT THIS TIME FOR HIS TWO MINUTE TEST IN. YES SIR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN CORRECT. I THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS JONATHAN FELDMAN WITH OUR STRATEGIES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION APERSONA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY A COMMITMENT THE POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION SHARES. THE ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL BILL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE ACTOR YOU LOBBY FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE LEGISLATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE CLOSED AT THE SIXTEEN- CLEARLY NOT BECAUSE POLICE YOU STILL TO THE BENEFIT RELEASING THIS INFORMATION. BUT RATHER DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL WILL OVERWHELM AGENCIES. COUPLED WITH THE STRICT TIMELINES IN CIVIL PENALTIES SB SIX. MINUTES PALATABLE FOR FAILURE. SB SIXTEEN EXPAND WHAT IS RELEASABLE TO INCLUDE SEVERAL NEW CATEGORIES INCLUDING ALL FILES RELATED TO END OF THIS CALL A CALL FROM THE BILL AN INCIDENT INVOLVING THE USE OF FORCE TO MAKE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC COMPLY WITH AN OFFICER. TO CLARIFY- BUT WHAT A PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID IT IS ALL FILED BY JUST THE PAIN WHEN IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE USE OF FORCE THIS IS UNFOUNDED AND UNDERSTAND AS WELL- IS A BROAD AND BIG EXPANSION THAT WILL APPLY TO MANY MANY INCIDENTS UNFORTUNATELY. I WE LOOK AT THE CONTEXT AFTER THE PASSAGE OF FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AND APPLIED TO THIS WHERE AGENCIES WERE INUNDATED WITH REQUESTS SOMETIMES DUPLICATIVE REQUESTS ASKING FOR ALL THE FILES RELEASABLE UNDER THE NEW STATUTES. AND THERE'S NO REASON. TO EXPECT ANYTHING DIFFERENT THE NEXT TIME. WE ANTICIPATE- THE SIGNIFICANT. ON YOU KNOW THESE FILES ARE SOMETIMES HUNDREDS OF PAGES ALONG REQUIRE HOURS AND HOURS OF STAFF TIME AND LEGAL REVIEW PREPARE IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH PRIVACY LAWS. AGENCIES DEDICATED FULL TIME STAFF MAJOR RESOURCES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH WAS DRAMATICALLY MORE NARROW THEM SB SIXTEEN. AND I WAS AT THE TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENT WASN'T STRUGGLING WITH THE FINANCIAL DOWNFALL. GLOBAL PANDEMIC. I SIXTEEN INCLUDE THE CIVIL PENALTIES FOR AGENCIES THAT DON'T MEET THE SIX MONTH DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE- WELL WE DO APPRECIATE THE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION WHICH WAS SOMETHING WE ASK FOR LAST YEAR. SIX MONTH IS INSUFFICIENT GIVEN THE MASSIVE NEW REQUIREMENT. THAT YOU SIXTEEN ALSO REQUIRED THESE RECORDS ARE HELD INDEFINITELY AND TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT AGENCIES PAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS STORAGE. UNDER EXISTING FIVE YOUR ATTENTION CALLED THE- OTHER A DRAMATIC EXPANSION. FINALLY AT SIXTEEN- ALTHOUGH NOT IN IN THE BILL ITSELF BUT PART OF THE PRIOR STATUTE IN SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. STILL ALLOWS AN OFFICER WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF AN INVESTIGATION TO REQUEST THEIR OWN FILE DURING THAT ACTIVE INVESTIGATION. I WHICH WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF TAKING PLACE. WHICH IS AN UNINTENDED ERROR IN THE STATUTE BUT THAT WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO UNDERMINE JUSTICE IF WE EXPAND THE STATUE WITHOUT TAKING THIS CALL. THIS IS AN ISSUE WE BROUGHT UP IN OUR CONVERSATION SOMETHING WE HOPE TO RESOLVE THIS YEAR. ULTIMATELY AS OUR RECORD SHOWS THE POLICE CHIEF SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY AND HAVE APPRECIATED THE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WIT THE AUTHOR. WE HOPE TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS WITH FEATURES AMENDMENTS BUT UNTIL THEN WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED FOR THE REPORT STATED. THANK YOU. Q. X. WITNESS COURSE ALL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY CELLS ARE LOW HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION WITH APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE AND AUTHOR FOR CONTINUING WORK ON THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY WE AS WE WERE TO SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE MUST OPPOSE SENATE BILL SIXTEEN BILLION ACKERMAN OF SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE STATUTE AND CASE LAW PROVIDED ENHANCED AN APPROPRIATE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR PEACE OFFICER PERSONAL RECORDS. AS WELL AS METHODS AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH RECORDS COULD BE ACCESSED SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE MADE SPECIFIED RECORDS AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC DISPLEASURE BUT MAINLY LIMITED THE SCOPE OF WHAT COULD BE RELEASED RECORDS RELATING TO USES OF FORCE THAT RESULTED IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY OR OTHER SITUATIONS IN WHICH A COMPLAINT OF WRONGDOING HAD BEEN SUSTAINED. AS MR FELDMAN NOTED SB SIXTEEN ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT THE RECORDS MADE AVAILABLE FOR RELEASE REGARDING USES OF FORCE BE LIMITED TO THOSE SITUATIONS INVOLVING DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY AND INSTEAD MAKES NEARLY ALL RECORDS RELATIVE TO NEARLY ANY USE OF FORCE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC THIS IS AN EXCEEDINGLY BROAD EXPANSION OF EXISTING LAW. FURTHER THE BILL LANGUAGE PROVIDING THAT THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. CANNOT BE ASSERTED TO LIMIT THE DISCLOSURE OF FACTUAL INFORMATION IS UNNECESSARY. AND COULD UNDERMINE EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BY THEIR COUNSEL.

IT WE ARE WILL- BOB. WELL COM OF MISSPELLED BY ITSELF YOU KNOW WE THE QUICK BOB THIS BY THE MOST ON. THAT WE DO THE OF FOR THEIR AND OPPOSITE TO YOUR OR INTERNET THANK YOU. AT THE TIME OF THE TERM AND WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU OKAY NO FURTHER WITNESSES IN Q. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BY THE COMMITTEE. MANBIJ SURE. FURTHER SKINNER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRING THIS BILL TO THE FOREFRONT I AM VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT IN IN PLACE SPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR- PUBLIC AGENCIES. IN THAT RESPECT- I DO HAVE MANY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE AND FRIENDS WHO ARE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SO MY VIEW AB ON THAT END IS COMES FROM A- CONCERNED THAT I HAVE WITH REGARDS TO. HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS SPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF WATER THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN. I CANNOT IMAGINE LOSING A FAMILY MEMBER. TO TO AN INCIDENT WHERE A LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS INVOLVED AND- YOU KNOW WE- ARE NOW SAID BUCKLEY HEREBY WE PRAY FOR A LOT ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SPECIALLY- THOSE WHO ARE AT THE FRONT AT THE FRONT LINES OF. OF SITUATIONS WHERE IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO THINK WITH THE FRONTAL LOBE OF HER BRAIN IN PURSES THE REACTIVE FROM A PART OF THE ROOM OUR BRAIN SO. THAT'S THE- THE CONTEXT IN WHICH I A I'M I'M SPEAKING IN ASKING QUESTIONS BECAUSE- THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS THAT I RESPECTED AND APPRECIATED THE SPELL BUT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT I DO HAVE. I'M ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IS GOING FURTHER THAN FIVE YEARS- THE IN INFORMATION IS THERE A REASON FOR THAT THAT FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING FURTHER BACK IN NOT HAVING A LIMITED TIME FRAME. AND COMING FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE FROM THE SCHOOL BOARD WHERE- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND WE IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SMALL WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF STAFF IN OUR AND- WHEN THE REQUEST PUBLIC RECORDS IT REALLY DOES TAKE A LOT OF TIME- FROM. THE LIMITED STOCK THAT WE DO HAVE SO THAT IS A CONCERN FOR ME- AS FAR AS BE ABLE TO. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT- THAT INFORMATION AND IN A TIMELY AND- IN A TIMELY WAY. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE- UNLIMITED- TIME FRAMES FOR REQUESTING RECORDS. A PERMISSION TO ANSWER ANY PROTECTIONS PERMISSION THANK YOU- SOME OF THE DAY'S A GOOD QUESTION AND THE HISTORY OF WHY A FIVE YEAR RETENTION OF RECORDS WAS- PUT INTO PLACE IS PRIOR TO ABOUT FORTY FOUR YEARS AGO NOW. ALL POLICE RECORDS WERE AVAILABLE UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT ANY AND ALL. AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WAS FOUND WAS THAT AGENCIES WERE DESTROYING THE RECORDS SO THEY DID NOT HAVE TO RELEASE THEM THEY DIDN'T HAVE A THAT ENOUGH TO RELEASE IT. AND THERE WAS NO% REAL ISSUE THE PROHIBITION ON THEY'RE DESTROYING THEM. SO THE GOVERNOR BROWN IN HIS FIRST TERM SO PRIOR TO HIS MOST RECENT SERVICES GOVERNOR. ENDED UP. NEGOTIATING A BILL THAT WOULD BASICALLY. GIVE HER A NEW NóI OR WORD STOP ALL PUBLIC CCESS BUT REQUIRE AGENCIES TO AT LEAST HOLD ON TO RECORDS FOR FIVE YEARS TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS. NOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OTHER PUBLIC THAT THE PUBLIC RECORDS LINE ITSELF IF YOUR EVEN YOUR SCHOOL THE DID THE ISSUE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY DON'T HAVE THE ROLE OF THEY CAN ONLY KEEP RECORDS FOR FIVE YEARS THEY HAVE THE ROLE THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP RECORDS. THERE ISN'T A PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD. AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ALL USED THE EXAMPLE OF THE DIRECTOR OF IN CASE AND- WHERE HE IS NOW- BEFORE THE COURT FOR THE- MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD AND- IT'S A REAL NUMBER ONE WE WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN. IN CALIFORNIA PRIOR TO FOURTEEN TWENTY WELL EVEN UNDER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT HE HAD A HISTORY OF FOR EXAMPLE USE OF FORCE AND ALSO DISCRIMINATORY OR BIASED BEHAVIOR WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT. NOW IT'S ALSO WOULD WOULD APPEAR FROM THE REPORTS IS THAT. WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL IT GOES BACK. MANY MANY MANY YEARS. AND HAD WE AND IF THIS WERE CALIFORNIA AND WE WOULD HAVE PERHAPS IF HE HAD NOT. ACTED IN SUCH A WAY AND MAYBE THERE WAS ONLY ONE INCIDENT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD WE WOULD THINK OKAY THIS IS AN OFFICER ONLY HAD ONE INCIDENT WHERE IS MAYBE OVER TEN YEAR PERIOD HE HAD TWENTY. SO THE FIVE YEAR RETENTION THAT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL LAW. WAS REAL PRETTY ARBITRARY I DIDN'T REALLY GIVE US A FULL. PICTURE OF. A CIRCUMSTANCE AN OFFICER AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT MANY TIMES AFTER THERE IS A USE OF FORCE AND OFFICERS PUT ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE UNTIL INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED AND WE'VE TAKEN THREE FOUR YEARS BEFORE WE COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS SO IN THAT THREE OR FOUR YEARS THAT THEY MAY BE ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT ENGAGING IN OTHER BEHAVIORS BUT MAYBE THEY DID WELL PRIOR TO THAT. AND SO AGAIN I'M TRYING TO PUT HAT TIME PERIOD- NOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE STATE. DO NOT DRAW THEIR WEAPONS DO NOT ENGAGE IN REASONABLE FORCE AND DO NOT ENGAGE IN THE MISCONDUCT THAT THESE THAT ARE MY BILLS EITHER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE OR THIS ONE WOULD AFFECT- SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT UNFORTUNATELY A SMALL PERCENT. BUT IT THAT IS WHY WE NEED THIS INFORMATION SO BADLY BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HOLD AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE. AND WHILE JONATHON FELDMAN FROM THE POLICE CHIEFS DIDN'T INDICATE WHY THE POLICE CHIEFS SUPPORTED FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE PART OF IT WAS EVEN THE CHEEKS COULD NOT. ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICERS THEY WERE HIRING FROM ANOTHER. JURISDICTION SO THEY DIDN'T KNOW WERE THAT WERE THEY GETTING AN OFFICER WITH A HISTORY OF. EITHER BIASED BEHAVIOR OR UNLAWFUL SEARCHES OR YOU KNOW USE OF FORCE THEY DIDN'T KNOW SO NOW THEY CAN NO. AND AS YOU HEARD THE PRINCIPAL CONCERN THE CHIEFS HAVE IS THE- IN FACT I AM NOT TO MINIMIZE IT BUT THE SORT OF PAPERWORK BURDEN. BUT IF WE LOOK AT. THERE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY THERE WILL BE A GREAT INCREASE IN REQUEST AS SOON AS THE BILL IS IN EFFECT BUT THEN AFTER THAT SO THEN PASSED THINGS WILL HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED YES THAT PUTS A BURDEN ON THE AGENCY. BUT ONCE THOSE ARE DISCLOSED IT IS ONLY ANY ANY ACTION MOVING FORWARD. AND WHAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE IS THAT VERY FEW OF THESE ACTIONS WOULD OCCUR AND THAT OUR AGE AND SO THEN THIS IS NOT A BURDEN. SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT UP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HE DISCOVERS WHAT. SUCH AS ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS GOOD POINT AND I THINK YU MENTIONED ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT I ACTUALLY. QUITE ADMIRED ABOUT THE BILL IS THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW WHEN. POLICE OFFICERS ARE BEING HIGHER CONSIDER FURTHER CONSIDERATION OR FOR OTHER POSITIONS IN OTHER AREAS THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO LOOK. INTO THE PAST HERE I THINK- THAT IS ACTUALLY VERY- FAVORABLE. FOR THE POLICE STATIONS THAT ARE THE POLICE DISTRICT ARE ACTUALLY HIRING THEM SO THAT WAS A GOOD POINT AND IKE I SAID. I THINK THERE ARE MANY MANY GOOD POINTS. THAT ON THERE I WAS JUST I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS- OR THE PARAMETERS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY- VERY DEFINED PARAMETERS AND IT MAKES IT VERY. ON AT. JUST OPEN ENDED BASICALLY SO THAT'S AND THAT'S MY MAJOR CONCERN AS FAR AS A TOOL FOR MANY. AREAS HOPEFULLY THAT THEY WILL BE HOPING YOU DON'T HAVE THE CASE TO HAVE TO BE IN THE AND THAT. BUT MOVING FORWARD STILL I WOULD LOVE TO SEE. MORE OF A- MORE DEFINED PARAMETERS. AND ALSO A CONSIDERATION AS WELL. IN THE- BEHAVIOR ESPECIALLY WITH WITH- INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW FURTHER THAN- FURTHER BACK THAN FIVE YEARS. IS THAT WHEN I LOOK. AT TRAINING AND I LOOK AT EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN WHERE MUCH OF THE TIME YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY ADAM YOU KNOW YOU YOUR UNCERTAIN PART OF YOUR BRAIN YEAR EUROPE REACTION. REACTIONARY MODE AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LEARN I MEAN I'M TALKING AS A- FRESHMAN SENATOR HERE WHO. GETS IN FRONT OF A MICROPHONE IN FRONT OF IT PEOPLE AND I GET SO NERVOUS I HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING SITES CAN ONLY IMAGINE WENT OFFICERS IS. IN A SITUATION THAT IS. YOU KNOW NOT AT. OPTIMAL- AT. CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I ALSO THAT WITH EXPERIENCE COMES THE ABILITY TO MAKE BETTER JUDGMENTS AND BETTER. DECISIONS WHEN. PERFORMING ONCE DUTIES. AND SOME A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT- WITH THE OPENING OF THE ACTS OF BEING FOR THAN FIVE YEARS THAT. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE TO IN EXPERIENCE. AND AND- THE LACK OF BEING ON THE FRONTLINE OF THE PROFESSION. AND SO I A ALSO BELIEVE IN IN GIVING GRAYSON I'M WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE IN IN IN PRISON REFORM AS WELL. IN LOOKING AT THAT BUT WITH BALANCING PROTECTIONS AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE- IF I WERE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS THIS BILL IN SUPPORT. IS TO SEE PARAMETERS AND EVELYN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF GRACE FOR EXPERIENCE FOR OFFICERS THAT PERHAPS MADE. MIGHT HAVE DONE A COUPLE OF. MISTAKES IN IN THEIR- IN THE ERROR. IN THEIR JOB- PER SE. IN DOING THEIR JOB DUE TO LACK OF EXPERIENCE AND HOLDING THAT AGAINST THEM IN A WAY BECAUSE- IT'S NOT EASY I CAN'T IMAGINE I MEAN IT I COULD NOT I DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO BE IN THE FRONT LINES. IN THE MILITARY AND I DON'T HAVE IT TO BE A PEACE OFFICER SO I DO HAVE. A LITTLE BIT OF COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING ON THAT AND DID NOT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I DON'T. BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE THEY ARE HERE TO PROTECT US AND DO WELL BUT- FOR THOSE WHO. HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN THE FRONT LINES AND DO THAT UNFORTUNATELY I DO I DO HAVE A LIMIT OF CONCERN ON THAT END. FINNISH COMMITTEE WANNA DRESS CENTER- IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND- IT. IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT WITH EXPERIENCE- ONE'S ABILITY TO NOTE TO LEARN BETTER HOW HOW DO DE CONTEXTS AND SITUATIONS TO REACT. ON. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE OPPOSITION ABSOLUTELY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND TRYING TO MAKE A- A BILL THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE IN IN A MANNER THAT IS EQUITABLE AND FAIR- AND WITH GRACE FOR EVERYONE FOR NOT JUST THE AND IN. ESSENCE TO HONOR THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES. WHICH CAN'T IMAGINE BUT ALSO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE. FOR TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO PROTECT US AS WELL SO- YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IS INTHE RIGHT PLACE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING AND HELPING DEVICE AT A GOOD- WELL ROUNDED POLICY FOR ALL OF THE SAFETY FOR THE WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SHE NINE ARTIFICERS CAN ARM AND THANK YOU FOR THIS MEASURE I THINK IT'S A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT'S LONG OVERDUE I THINK HISTORY HAS SHOWN US THAT THE LONGER THE OFFICER WHO HAS COMMITTED A ACTS SUCH AS THIS CASE CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE CAREER IT'S NOT A ONE AND DONE IT'S NOT A LACK OF EXPERIENCE IT'S A MINDSET. AND I FIND IT VERY INTERESTING THAT MR FELDMAN STATED THAT THEY ARE FOR TRANSPARENCY I WOULD IF YOU STILL ON THE LINE I WOULD LIKE HIM TO ADDRESS PARTY HOW DOES HE RESPOND TO THE NUMBER OF AGENCIES THAT DESTROYED RECORDS JUST WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS BEFORE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO A FACT TWO YEARS AGO ONE BEING IN MY OWN DISTRICT SHOW I WOULD. LOVE TO HEAR THE JUSTIFICATION ON WHY- WE SHOULD BELIEVE THAT. POLICE CHIEF OR THEIR AGENCY SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY THEY'RE DESTROYING RECORDS BEFORE THE BILL WENT INTO EFFECT. YEAH HI SENATOR. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN AND I'M NOT GOING TO THE SPEAKER THOSE AGENCIES TO TRY AND JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS I MEAN THAT WAS THEIR DECISION- IT'S NOT REPRESENTATIVE I THINK OF THE BOOK OF THE POLICE CHIEFS OR OF THE ASSOCIATION. IS LEADERSHIP CLEARLY STOOD WITH- SKINNER ON HER PRIOR BILL LOBBIED FOR IT BUT I WAS THE ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP TO STAND OUT AGAINST THAT MAN. WHICH TO DO- TAKE ACTION BUT THE IT IS YOU KNOW BASED OFF A YOU KNOW WHAT FACT THEY LOOK OUT AT THE LOW LEVEL- YEAH. YES AS USUAL SPEAK INTO THE AGENT. WE CAN JUST SAY THAT ARE LEADERSHIP OUR- ARE YOU. TEAM YOU KNOW AS A AS A WRECK FOR WORK WITH FOLKS BILLS LIKE THIS OF STANDING WITH FOLKS. INCREASED I'M NOT SURE HOPE. TO DO AGAIN I HOPE WE CAN THROUGH- SOME THE CONCERNS ABOUT EARLIER. TO THANK YOU BUT I THINK IT'S TO. THE L. WE'RE TO ADDRESS THE ONE OFFS BACK STAYING THE WHOLE. INDUSTRY AND I THINK THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU JUST GAVE THAT YOUR SITUATION TRONG SUPPORTS TRANSPARENCY BUT YOU HAVE AGENCIES WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION THAT'S THE SAME AS UP. A ROBOCOP THAT CHANGE OLD APARTMENT EVEN THOUGH THE MAJORITY OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN. DO THEIR JOB IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY. AND I WOULD JUST ADDRESS TO THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW. HOW ONE'S. BRAIN FUNCTIONS IT SEEMS LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT BRING FUNCTIONS QUITE WELL WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER WHITE MEN WHO ARE ARMED SOMETIMES AND DANGERS BUT- THEIR BRAIN SEEMS TO WORK A LOT DIFFERENT WHEN IT'S BLACK AND BROWN SHOW UP. AGAIN I THINK YOU FOR THIS MEASURE WE ALSO WOULD STILL THAT'S WE HAD SOME- CALLERS ON. OFF IN OPPOSITION THAT. WE DO GET TO. IT TO SO MAN MODERATOR CAN YOU CHECK THE LINE ONCE AGAIN TO SEE IF THERE ANY CALLS IN QUEUE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB SIXTEEN PRESS ONE ZERO. AGAIN THAT'S ONE ZERO TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB SIXTEEN. ONE MOMENT MISTER CHAIR. AT THIS TIME NO ONE IS SHOWING UP THERE. YOUR WE'VE GIVEN YOUR CHANCE OVER CHECK THE LINES OKAY HEARING NO OTHER OPPOSITION HER NO OTHER DISCUSSION BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS SANDERS CAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IN MEMBERS THE- WHAT I FOUND PARTICULARLY STRIKING WAS- CEPHUS JOHNSON UNCLE BOBBIE'S COMMENTED ABOUT EVEN IN THE TIME SINCE OSCAR GRANT'S MURDER IN THAT PARTICULAR OFFICER WAS PROSECUTED AND CONVICTED. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OVER A THOUSAND- DEATHS AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN CALIFORNIA- AND WHAT I THINK HE REFERENCED A MAYBE THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE NEED A CULTURE CHANGE AND IN A WAY TRANSPARENCY WILL HELP US ACHIEVE A CULTURE CHANGE AND WHEN I SAY THAT I ALSO SEE THAT AS IN THE INDICATED EARLIER THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE NOT. IN THAT MODE THEY ARE NOT AND EVERYONE OF THEM REGARDLESS OF THEIR PARTICULAR ATTITUDES TAKE THEIR LIVES IN THEIR HANDS EVERY TIME THEY PUT ON THAT UNIFORM AND WALK OUT THEIR DOOR AND WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE PUT AT RISK VERY OFTEN BUT AND SADLY IF WE REFER TO THE BILL WE HEARD JUST EARLIER VERY OFTEN IN DOMESTIC CALLS THAT THAT CAN BE THE MOST RISKY AND YET THEY RESPOND AND THEY SHOW UP. AND SO WE WANT TO ACHIEVE MY OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE SAFETY FOR EVERYONE SAFETY FOR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAFETY FOR OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND TO HAVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT HELL TO WHAT IS APPROPRIATELY A VERY HIGH STANDARD AND I THINK THIS TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY WILL HELP US DO IT AND I CERTAINLY COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO TALK TO THE OPPOSITION TO. SEE WHETHER THERE ARE MODIFICATIONS THAT CAN SWITCH THEIR CONCERNS AND YET STILL ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE OF THE BILL AND FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE LOOK AT OTHER STATES WHILE THIS BILL DOES EXPAND THE ACCESS TO RECORDS WE ARE STILL NOT GIVING FULL ACCESS TO EVERY TYPE OF POLICE MISCONDUCT AND IF WE COMPARE FOR EXAMPLE NEW YORK STATE OHIO MANY MANY OTHER STATES KENTUCKY EVEN THEY HAVE FULL 1100% ACCESS THERE'S NO LIMITATION ON THE RECORDS THAT THE PUBLIC CAN- OBTAIN. SO IT IS STILL ON I HAVE A NOTE THIS MAY NOT BE OF PRECEDED BY SOME OF THE OPPOSITION BUT IT IS STILL MODEST COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A TO PASS TO JUDICIAL RECOMMENDATION CAN WE GET A MOTION ON. THIS MEASURE. ANY MEMBER WILLING TO MAKE A MOTION ON SB. SIXTEEN ANY MEMBER WANTED TO MAKE A MOTION ON S. B. SIXTEEN. CENTER WINTER WE HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE A DO PASSED YOU JUDICIARY. ADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SB SIXTEEN TO PASS TO JUDICIARY BRADFORD AREN'T FOR DIETRO AGO. ADOBO GUYS BY IN OUR AYE WIENER WIENER I'D FOUR ZERO. THAT MEASURES OUT FOUR ZERO THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER NEXT UP IS SENATOR WIENER WE HAVE. S. P. SEVENTY THREE- WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED SB SEVENTY THREE I THANK YOU- MISTER THANK YOU DEARLY COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US IN THIS BILL COLLEAGUES ARE SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE WILL REPEAL MANDATORY MINIMUM. PRISON OR JAIL SENTENCES FOR PEOPLE CONVICTED OF CERTAIN NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES AND WILL PROVIDE JUDGES- WITH THE DISCRETION TO GRANT PROBATION ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS TO BE CLEAR- THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT REDUCE THE MAXIMUM PENALTY NOR DOES IT ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF JAIL- INSTEAD- IT GIVES JUDGES DISCRETION BASED ON THE CASE TO DECIDE WHETHER A JAIL OR PRISON SENTENCE MAKE SENSE OR WHETHER PROVISION MAKES SENSE CURRENTLY FOR A LAUNDRY LIST. OF NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES IN CALIFORNIA. FIVE A JUDGE IS MANDATED TO SEND THE PERSON TO JAIL OR PRISON I HAS NO DISCRETION NO MATTER WHAT THE FACTS OF THE CASE. TO PUT THE PERSON ON PROBATION INSTEAD- THIS MAKES NO SENSE- THIS FUELS MASS INCARCERATION WE KNOW THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS- MANDATING THAT WE PUT PEOPLE IN PRISON FOR NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES. HAS BEEN ABJECT FAILURE IT HASN'T REDUCED DRUG USE THAT HAS A REDUCED- ADDICTION ALL IT'S DONE IS FUELED INCARCERATION CROWDED OUR JAILS. ARE TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM HEALTH AND EDUCATION OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS AND FRANKLY IT'S SHOCKING THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MANDATE THAT NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENDERS GO TO PRISON EVEN IF THE JUDGE THING SEPARATION. IS MORE APPROACH- THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED IT'S TIME TO GIVE JUDGES DISCRETION TO MAKE THAT CHOICE INSTEAD OF MANDATING OUT- AND SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON S. B. SEVENTY THREE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION OUR JUDGE HARLING GROSSMAN WHO IS A RETIRED JUDGE- WITH THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT- AND THE NEXT TO IT- AND WHO IS AN APPELLATE ATTORNEY. AT THE LOS ANGELES PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU. IT'S JUDGE GROSSMAN PREPARE TO FORGE TESTIMONY. YES GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M MARLA GROSSMAN I'M A RETIRED JUDGE FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. I RETIRED NINE YEARS AGO AFTER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF JUDICIAL SERVICE I WAS A PROSECUTOR FOR NINE YEARS BEFORE BECOMING A JUDGE. SINCE RETIRING I'VE BEEN ACTIVE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY ADVOCATES IN. I'M HERE THIS MORNING TO ADVOCATE IN FAVOR OF SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE WHICH WOULD REPEAL THE PROBATION OF ABILITY AND ARTISTIC PENSION OF SENSES PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN ENUMERATED NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES. THERE BY RESTORING JUDICIAL DISCRETION TO IMPOSE APPROPRIATE SENTENCES TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH DEFENDANT THAT COMES BEFORE THE COURT. RESTRICTIONS ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN SENTENCING DO NOT SERVE AS A DETERRENT TO CRIME. RATHER THEY ONLY SERVE TO LIMIT THE DISCRETION IN THE HANDS OF JUDGES TIED THE HANDS OF JUDGES INVOLVED IN THE EDUCATION THIS POSITION AND RESOLUTION OF THESE CASES. IT MAKES LITTLE SENSE TO LIMIT JUDICIAL DISCRETION ON THE THING OF THESE MATTERS. JUDGES RETAIN AN EXERCISE THEIR DISCRETION ON MUCH WEIGHTIER ISSUES SUCH AS WHETHER TO IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY. WHETHER TO STRIKE THE STRIKE CONVICTION WHETHER A CASE SHOULD PROCEED IN JUVENILE COURT OR BE TRANSFERRED TO CRIMINAL FOR ADULT COURT. WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. THE CHORE MINIMUM SENSORS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY INCLUDING NOT BEING COST EFFECTIVE. CONNECTING SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE WILL PERMIT MORE EFFECTIVE THE SENATE BASED SENTENCING AND MORE EFFICIENT USE CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESOURCES- JANET HI VOTE ON SENATE BILL SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU.

I WE DO UNDERSTAND THE NEED IMPORTANCE FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK THE CUBBIES AND EVENTS I WANT STATE THAT I THE WAY OF BLUE AUTHORED TO WORK US ON THE ISSUE AND HOPEFULLY CAN MORE TIME THIS YEAR. FINALLY TOOK THE GOAL OF THE PLEDGE WITH OBJECTION THREE WOULD BE A ON THE. WE HAVE JONATHAN BUT THAT WAS JONATHAN FED. WALDRON IT WAS OKAY DO WE HAVE SHAUN RUNDLE. ON THE LINE YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME MADAM CHAIR WE AT WE CAN YES SIR GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING- MANAGER MEMBERS SAID SHAUNA WITH THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OR C. P. O. A. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE OFFICE OFFICE WELL FOR NOT ONLY DISCUSSIONS THIS YEAR BUT IN TWENTY TWENTY ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF THE CIVIL UNREST ISSUES OF THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. A NON UNION LEADERSHIP. ASSOCIATION OF MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND COPS WHO WANT TO BE AND LIED ABOUT COPS. OUR MEMBERS ARE BOTH SUPERVISORY AND FRONTLINE OFFICERS RECEIVED ACROSS THE SPECTRUM WHO ROUTINELY SET UP COMMAND POSTS DESCRIBED IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. BECAUSE- MY COLLEAGUE MR CALL ME JUST MENTIONED WORDING OF PC FOR NINE POINT SEVEN. WELL YES IT DOES REFERENCE AN EMERGENCY COMMAND POST BUT ALSO SET UP ANY OTHER COMMAND POST. AT A DEMONSTRATION MARCH RALLY OR PROTEST WHERE THE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENGAGED PRIMARILY AND CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ACTIVITY SO WHAT THAT MEANS TO THE GRANTING SO CALLED MEDIA ACCESS TO SIMULTANEOUS OR NEARBY COMMAND POST SET UP IN RESPONSE PERHAPS TO A VIOLENT. RIOT OR A- UP SO WE'LL JUST. YOU NEED TO COMMAND BECAUSE A DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF INFORMATION DISCLOSED SAFETY PROTOCOL SEVEN PERHAPS AN EMERGENCY DISCLOSURE- AND FOR EXAMPLE CONCERN REMAINS REGARDLESS OF DUTY OPERATOR DULY AUTHORIZED OR NOT. BE INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL LEAKING OR AFP OR BROADCASTING A TACTICAL INFORMATION FROM A DEMONSTRATION- COMMAND GOES BACK COULD JEOPARDIZE THE SAFETY OF OFFICERS. AND CIVILIANS- B. ACCORDING TO THE BILL AUTHORITIES ME TO AND COMMAND CLOSEST WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE IN. THAT IS PER PROTECTED- OBVIOUSLY UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT BUT IT DOES NOT DISTINGUISH THAT IT IS ONLY DURING PROTESTS OR REGISTRATIONS BUT INSTEAD ANY COMMAND CODES WHERE THERE HAPPENS TO BE A DEMONSTRATION. STAR MEMBERS HAVE FEARS OF PUTTING PEOPLE IN HARM'S WAY BY ALLOWING ACCESS FOR- TOWARD PEOPLE CLAIMING TO BE JOURNALISTS AS WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES OR INFORMATION GATHERS BY SIMPLY WATCHING A BUSINESS CARD. IT'S NOTED IN PREVIOUS BILL DISCUSSIONS THE MONUMENTAL TASK OF ENSURING THE SAFETY OF LARGE NUMBERS OF DEMONSTRATORS. AND THEN COMING UP ONLINE FOR SPEND AND- WE FEEL THAT. WOULD PUT AT RISK THOSE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS- THERE'S ALSO NO CLEAR LANGUAGE ON SETTING A RESTRICTION ON HOW MANY. HOW MANY SUPERVISORS CAN BE REQUESTED NOR HOW MANY CREDENTIALED MEDIA CAN ACCESS THE COMMAND POST. SO WHILE WE APPRECIATE. LAST YEAR'S WHOSE DEFINITION OF DULY AUTHORIZED ME TO BE REMOVED OUR CONCERN FOR ME WITH THE FACT THAT OTHER COMMAND POST SET UP BY THE BILL WILL BE TWO. MORE HARM THAN GOOD. AND DESPITE ANYTHING. TO THE CONTRARY LONG PORTIONS PRIORITIES ALWAYS THE SAFETY OF ALL PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE AT THE DEMONSTRATION MARC PROTESTER. OR AT LEAST GIVE ME. BUT IN THE MIDDLE AT THE JOHN LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR STRESSED THAT SETTING UP A COMMAND POST SHOULDN'T THEN IT BERKELEY PROVIDE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMAND CENTER- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WILL BE HERE SB NINETY EIGHT WILL DO. TRANSPARENCY OF THE PRUDENT LIMITS AND CERTAIN QUALITY- TACTICS AND STRATEGY SHOULD BE SAFEGUARDED THE PLOT FORTUNATE TO KEEP OUR STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IN CONTROLLING. RIOTS AND PROTESTS AND IN DOING SO HOLDING THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF THOSE INVOLVED AND PROTECTING THE LIVES OF ALL OF OUR PROTECTING ALL LIFE. AND PROPERTY THANK YOU MISTER LANDER.

SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SENATE RADFORD THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS ON BEHALF OF MR REQUIRED- I THINK MANY OF US- IN WATCHING NEWS REPORTS OF VARIOUS OF THE EVENTS. THAT WERE IN RESPONSE TO EITHER THE- GEORGE FORD INCIDENT OR OTHERS I THINK WE KIND OF WATCHED IN HORROR WHERE- WELL EVEN IF WE TAKE EVEN THE CAPITAL- INSURRECTION WHERE WE SAW- LEGITIMATE PRESS REPORTERS WHETHER TV NEWS WITH CAMERA OTHERS. IN EFFECT JUST- EITHER- OF OVERRIDDEN OR OR- ELIMINATED FROM THE SITE AND JUST LIKE THE BILL I PRESENTED. INSPERITY IS VERY IMPORTANT IN DEMOCRACY AND OUR NEWS REPORTERS YOU KNOW WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THE NEWS OR NOT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRESENT TO US FULLY AND IF THEY ARE. INTERFERED WITH IN AT PROTESTS OR ANY OTHER TYPES OF EVENTS THEN WE DO NOT GET THAT. NOW THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT VARIOUS OPPOSITION REYES THAT PROBABLY THE MEMBER I'M SURE IT WILL WORK FINE. AND I WON'T ASK YOU THE QUESTION I MEAN YOU COURSE COULD ANSWER HAVE YOU HAVE THE CENTER BUT- I KNOWING THE AUTHOR. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THOSE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED THAT DESERVE TO BE- MODIFIED AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT HE WILL INTERACT WITH THE OPPOSITION AND- DO SO APPROPRIATELY IF IT IS APPROPRIATE. AND SO I AM- IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND MARY POLICE SAID IT WAS BROUGHT. AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'M HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION. THANK YOU FOR THEIR SKINNER. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR- QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I DO HAVE A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO- HOW TO BETTER- IDENTIFIED THE PRESS- THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ARE THERE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW THAT WOULD BE- BE ABLE TO CLARIFY AND MAKE SURE THAT. IT'S JUST THE PRESIDENT'S BEING. ALLOWED TO HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER AREAS. ARE THE SAME WAY IT'S BEEN DONE FOR DECADES BY HAVING PROPER PRESS CREDENTIALS THAT CLEARLY HAS USUALLY AUTHORIZED BY A LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCAL JURISDICTION IT CLEARLY IDENTIFIES THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE SURPRISED NOTHING CHANGES JUST AS YOU. HAVE PROCESSES SHOW THEIR ID TO COMING HERE TO COME TO A NASH NATURAL OR NATURAL DISASTER THE SAME WOULD BE FOR MARCH A PROTESTER ANY OTHER KIND OF RALEIGH CHAU- THEY FIGURE IT OUT FOR ANYTHING ELSE SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE TE CONFUSION WITH- HAPPENED JUST BECAUSE IT'S A RALLY OR PROTEST OR BLACK LIVES MATTER. OR IN THE- HAVE ASSEMBLED. I'M JUST GONNA CARRY JUST BECAUSE I KNOW HOW PEOPLE CAN- FOR DOCUMENTS FORCES DOCUMENTS AND THAT THAT'S THE REASON FOR MY QUESTION IS JUST YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ASSURE ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM. SPURRED A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE OF MOVING TO OTHER AREAS FIRST NOT NOT HAVING TO- HAVING MORE ACCESS BASICALLY AND SO THAT IS THE CONCERN IF WE GIVE THEM MORE ACCESS THAN- HAVE MORE PRIVILEGE IN THAT IN THAT RESPECT. AND HOW DO WE ASSURE AND MAKE. BASICALLY HOW DO WE- ASSURE THAT THE PAST ARE NOT BEING FORTUNATE BEING- DUPLICATED THIS BILL DOESN'T GRANT ANY MORE PRIVILEGE THAN ALREADY EXIST UNDER- PINNACLE FOUR ZERO NINE POINT FIVE ALL THE STATE'S AS IN A NATURAL DISASTER USE. ESTABLISH A DESIGNATED AREA FOR PROCESS FOR PROTEST RALLY BACK THAT'S ALL THEY'RE ASKING THE SAME GUIDELINES THAT ALREADY EXIST AND WHILE THIS ISN'T EXPAND UPON ANYTHING SO AGAIN WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT I THE NOW TO DISASTER IN AGAIN PRESSER NO WARM CLAWING TO. GET IN THE LINE OF FIRE AN ARMY FOOD OR FAR BUT A PROTEST IN FIGHTING IN THE SKIRMISHERS GROUND NO MORE THAN THEY WANT TO BE IN A LINE OF A NATURAL DISASTER BE IT A FLOOD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY WANT TO BE AN ASSEMBLY DESIGNATED AREA WHERE THEY CAN REPORT. ALL WHAT'S GOING ON AND AGAIN THE STORY OF UNFETTERED ACCESS SYSTEM FOR THIS THING FROM THE TRUTH THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A COMMAND POST OR MOBILE VEHICLE OR- BEING YOUR- EAVESDROP RANGE OF. YOU KNOW WHATEVER POLICE OFFICERS ARE DOING STE CANADA AS AS A RELATES TO STRATEGY IT WOULD JUST SAY AGAIN TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A DESIGNATED AREA TO REPORT FROM A PROTEST. RALLY OR MARCH. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR BYRD- CONDUCTOR COMMITTEE START DO WE HAVE ANY MORE COMMENTS A QUESTION SENATOR SKINNER NO I WILL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. SENATOR BROUGHT FOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO. CLOSE YES THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF CENTER BAR I THINK S. B. NINETY EIGHT IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AGAIN IT ALLOWS WHAT WE ALL VALUE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS TO ACCURATELY TELL THE STORIES OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES THIS. DOES NOT AFFORD REPORTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERFERE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ANY KIND OF WAY IT JUST ALLOWS THEM TO DO WHAT RT AGAIN IN STATUTE AND IT WAS AGREEMENT- WITH THE GOVERNOR'S VETO LAST YEAR THAT THEY CAN COME UP ON THE GREEN AT ALL WHAT WAS DULY AUTHORIZED MEMBER OF THE PRESS. THIS NAILS CLEARLY STATE WHAT'S ALREADY IN FOR A LEGACY FOUR HUNDRED POINT I MEAN FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE POINT FIVE WHICH DULY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRESS THAT'S WHAT'S ALREADY THERE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES EIGHT ELIMINATED- THE MISDEMEANOR AS WELL THERE'S NO. CHARGER R. OR CRIME ASSOCIATED FOR POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE ARE DOING THEIR JOB SO IT'S NO ADDITIONAL CRIMES THAT OFFICERS ARE FEARFUL OF BECAUSE OF THE CENTURY.
