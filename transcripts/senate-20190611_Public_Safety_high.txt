SEVEN FOUR EIGHT OUR BODY CAMERA TRANSPARENCY BILL WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN LAST YEAR -- THE DRAFTING YEAR OLD MADE IT SEVEN WORDS THAT WERE CRITICAL TO CLARIFYING -- WHEN THE BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE COULD BE RELEASED SO WE ARE CARRYING THIS BILL AND WE WE COMMITTED? TO HI KAREN THIS BILL TO ADDRESS THAT DRAFTING HERE LAST YEAR WHEN THE BILL PASSED AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW SO. I RESPECT ASTRIDE VOTE ON A. B.. FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU CAN NEVER WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING WOULD BE PROUD CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATIONS COMMONSENSE FIX AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVALS. MANAGER MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER FROM AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA -- CO SPONSORED THE BILL LAST YEAR ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WE LOVE THESE BRIEF WITNESSES OTHERS IN SUPPORT. BUT ENSURE MEMBERS TEMPLES OUT ON BEHALF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THIS IMPORTANT CLEAN UP THANK YOU. GREAT. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. MY GOODNESS WE'RE STARTING OUT WELL -- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. THE BILL NOW YEAH. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SELL SCORE ANYWAY -- SEEING NO COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MISTER KING YOU MICHAELIS DISRESPECT YES RIGHT -- EXCELLENT WE WILL ACT ON IT -- ONCE WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM NOT MY SECOND YES PLEASE GO AHEAD I FORGOT YOU HAS TO THE DAILY LIFE TEEN RIGHT. TWELVE FIFTEEN FANS THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IN BODY CAMERAS -- AS YOU KNOW THE ADVENT OF FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY. AS IT'S BEING USED NOW IT IS FAIRLY ACCURATE -- FOR EXAMPLE AMAZON'S RECOGNITION FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE -- WHEN CROSS REFERENCE WITH -- THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE MUGSHOT MISIDENTIFIED TWENTY EIGHT SITTING MEMBERS. OF CONGRESS I INCLUDING ONE OF OUR FORMER COLLEAGUES -- CONGRESSMAN JIMMY GOMEZ -- SO WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY REALLY NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME. WE REALLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASS A BILL TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T USE. THIS -- SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE AS YOU RECALL BODY CAMERAS WERE REALLY. OF THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH WAS FIRST BE USED SO THAT. WE COULD BUILD TRUST WITH COMMUNITIES REALLY BUILD TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITIES. WE DON'T WANT IS FOR KEEPING IS TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE UNDER SURVEILLANCE TWENTY FOUR HOURS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WHEN THE OFFICER'S BODY CAMERA. ARE BEING WARNED -- IF YOU TALK TO ACTS ON IT WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRODUCERS OF BODY CAMERAS THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BE -- DEPLOYING FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IN THEIR BODY CAMERAS -- SO AGAIN WE REALLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. TWELVE FIFTY GO AHEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HELLO CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. A GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY MY NAME IS MATT CABLE AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- I'M ASK I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE FIFTEEN THE BODY CAM ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SO I JUST WANT FOLKS TO IMAGINE WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND BEING FORCED TO CONSTANTLY SHOW YOUR IDENTIFICATION. TO POLICE WITHOUT ANY SUSPICION WHATSOEVER AT THE SAME TIME YOUR LOCATION IS BEING LOGGED -- WHETHER YOU'RE AT CHURCH AT A PROTEST OR JUST STEPPING OUTSIDE ON YOUR FRONT PORCH. THAT IS THE WORLD THAT AB TWELVE FIFTEEN PROTECTS AGAINST. AB TWELVE FIFTEEN CODIFIES EXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS BY PROTECTING OUR BY PREVENTING THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION AND OTHER BIOMETRICS WITH BODY CAMERAS. AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING SAID. CAN'T ABIDE CAMERAS WERE PROMISES A TOOL FOR ACCOUNTABILITY NOT AS A SYSTEM TO TRACK AND IDENTIFY CALIFORNIANS. RESEARCHER AFTER RESEARCHER HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT FACE RECOGNITION IS AN ACCURATE AND RACIALLY BIASED. BODY CAMERA MAKER AXON HAS SAID HE IS NOT ACCURATE ENOUGH FOR POLICE OPERATIONS. AND TO OUR KNOWLEDGE NO CALIFORNIA POLICE AGENCIES USING BODY CAMERA ARE USING FACIAL RECOGNITION OF BODY CAMERAS. HI THIS BILL IS NOT DEPRIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OF ANYTHING IT IS ACTUALLY USING. BUT THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS CLEARER THAN EVER MICROSOFT JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE A CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WITH A SURVEILLANCE FOR BODY CAMERAS CITING HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS. THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS FLOOD TECHNOLOGY WILL LEAD TO ADDITIONAL DANGERS ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE PUBLIC. AND PEOPLE WHO FEAR BEING TRACKED WILL POTENTIALLY AVOID PROVIDING ASSISTANCE OR SEEKING HELP FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S WHY 62% OF LIKELY TWENTY TWENTY VOTERS IN A MARCH POLL FROM THIS YEAR AGREED A BODY CAMERA SHOULD BE USED SOLELY FOR POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. NOT FOR SURVEILLANCE OF THE PUBLIC. FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO VOTE I ON A. B. TWELVE FIFTEEN THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES. TO HELLO MY NAME IS NATE AND SHARES MY PLEASURE TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING REPRESENT ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT OF AB TOP FIFTEEN THE BODY CAM ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. TECHNOLOGY DOES HAVE THE POWER TO IMPROVE OUR LIVES YOU CAN MAKE A GOVERNMENT MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND EFFICIENT THANKS BOTH THIS NEW INFORMATION. BUT CAN ALSO CHILLER PRIVATE. IT CAN ALSO INVADE OUR PRIVACY AND CHILLER FREE SPEECH. WITH ME IS ACROSS THE STATE CALLS FOR BROADER IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICE BODY CAMERA USAGE. THEY DID SO WITH HOPES THAT GREATER TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY WOULD FACILITATE TRUST BETWEEN RESIDENTS PARTICULARS IN MARCH LAST COMMUNITIES. AND THE OFFICERS WERE TO PROTECT THEM. HOWEVER TODAY WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS AS FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY CAN NOW BE INTERFACED DIRECTLY WITH BY THE ONE CAMERAS pINTENDED TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY. INTO MASS BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE NETWORK. FACE RECOGNIZING TECHNOLOGY HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH ERROR RATES FOR WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. MAKING MATTERS WORSE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONDUCTING FACE THE VALVES OFTEN RELY ON IMAGES PULLED FROM MUGSHOT DATABASES WHICH INCLUDE A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF COLOR DUE TO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AS A RESULT FACE AVAILABLE EXACERBATED STRUGGLE BIASES BORN UP AND CONTRIBUTING TO UNFAIR POLICE. PLEASE PRACTICES IN BLACK AND LATINO X. NEIGHBORHOODS. THE STATE REQUIRES TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES THEREFORE TO PROTECT. THE REALIZATION OF FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND CONNECTION WITH POLICE BODY CAMERAS. WOULD FORCE CALIFORNIA TO DECIDE BETWEEN ACTIVELY AVOIDING INTERACTION AND COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR HAVING YOUR IMAGES COLLECTED ANALYZED AND STORED. AS FOR POTENTIAL CANDIDATES OF SUSPICION. NOT ONLY WITH THIS FOR THE VOTE COMMUNITY RELATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IN FACT ESCALATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A TRAGIC OUTCOME TO EACH INTERACTION. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE HI. ON AB TOP [inaudible] FIFTEEN THANK. I'M GOING TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM BEFORE WE CONTINUE CAN WE HAVE ROLL CALL PLEASE ENTER. YOUR SKINNER HERE MOORLACH PRESENT WELL I CARE BRADFORD. RIGHT FOR HERE JACKSON HERE JACKSON HERE MITCHELL MORALE. WIENER. SO THAT MEANS WE WILL BE ABLE TO A AT LEAST HAVE MOTIONS AS WE CONTINUE. LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER -- WELL LET'S A SINCE WE DID ROLL CALL WE JUST HAVE MEMBER WANTED TO ADD [inaudible] OKAY. SAY HERE. HERE. OKAY. WERE PRESENT ANYWAY -- LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOU CAN COME TO THE STANDING MIKE. THE END OF THE TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND IF THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE ONE IF YOU MAY NEED. TO LEAVE THE YEAH [inaudible] OKAY. SIR TO AT THE TABLE IN ONE OF THE MIKE. AND I'M SURE MEMBERS COURSE ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WINNER STAND THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT. PARTICULAR USE OF TECHNOLOGY -- I I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD NOTE THAT -- THE RESPONSE THESE CONCERNS -- IT IS AN APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF A BLANKET BAN -- THE THE PROPONENTS NOTE AND I THINK WE LARGELY AGREE THAT. IF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS IN USE IT'S NOT IN WIDE USE AND THE RESPONSE TO THESE CONCERNS WELL. THEY MAY BE FAIR CONCERNS. TO TAKE AWAY THAT AUTHORITY TO TAKE AWAY A TOOL COMPLETELY WITHOUT SORT OF ANY. THE NOTION OF LET'S ADDRESS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS -- THAT IT WOULD JUST THINK IT'S A IT'S AN INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE I THINK THERE ARE -- POTENTIALLY VERY STRONG USES FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY WHETHER IT'S HELPING REDACTING BODY CAM FOOTAGE MAKING SURE THAT -- CERTAIN PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE IDENTIFIED WHEN THE FOOTAGE IS RELEASED -- HELPING TO IDENTIFY SUSPECTS OR EXONERATE POTENTIAL SUSPECTS -- IT JUST JUST AGAIN THIS THIS TAKING AWAY OF THE TOOL -- WITHOUT SORT OF ANY YOU KNOW LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION LET'S HAVE A LOOK HAVE A COMMUNITY MEETING WHAT'S HAVE A SOME STANDARD WHERE WE LOOK AT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES. WE JUST WE'RE I THINK WE'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT TAKING WITH IT TOO I THINK THE OTHER NOTION TO IS THAT -- THE BODY CAMS ARE SOLELY FOR OFFICER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK A SHORT SIGHTED THEY CLEARLY HAVE. INVESTIGATIVE USE THEY HAVE USE THAT NOT ONLY -- PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM YOU KNOW MISBEHAVIOR BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO THE EXTENT IT HAPPENS IT ALSO PROTECTS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM. CRIMINAL OR MISS BEHAVIOR OF THE PUBLIC AND IT HELPS TELL A STORY IT'S NOT A PANACEA IT DOESN'T REVEAL EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED AND OFTEN DISPLACE ONE ANGLE. AND ONE PERSPECTIVE BUT IT DOES HELP TELL A STORY AND SO AGAIN TAKING AWAY THAT TOOL -- WE THINK HAS CONSEQUENCES THAT DON'T NECESSARILY OUTWEIGH THE PERCEIVED CONCERNED SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK YOU KNOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DILUTION HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE -- WE'VE BEEN IN AND I THINK SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE CONCERNING OUR A POSITION WHICH SUPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED -- NOT -- TO REGURGITATOR REITERATE -- MOST. OF MY COLLEAGUE RAISED BUT THERE'S SOME OTHER ASPECTS TO FACIAL RECOGNITION THAT WE THINK ARE ARE I THINK IMPORTANT I THINK WE WOULD ADVOCATE. FOR SITTING DOWN AT THE TABLE AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO REGULATE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES -- WHILE IT'S NOT WIDELY IN USE IN AND I THINK THERE IS SOME UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE MAN ONE OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE ACTUALLY ACTIVELY USING THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE -- BUT WE SEE VALUE IN THE EAST THE TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE -- TO IDENTIFY MISSING PERSONS. SO IN ANY INSTANCES WHERE. YOU KNOW FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH -- A BODY CAMERA AS IT RELATES. TO OF A YOUNG KID YOUNG BOY A YOUNG GIRL -- PERSON WHO IS MISSING. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD YOU WOULD. CONSIDER A BLANKET BAN WHEN THEY ARE CLEARLY SOME I THINK IDENTIFIABLE PERSON UP OF PURPOSES WITH. LESS CONTROVERSY I THINK THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER. IS THAT WHILE THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T PERFECT IN PERFECT IT HINGES ON TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE ARM. IMAGE QUALITY AND THEN IT ALSO HINGES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOFTWARE WILL AS IMAGE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES BECAUSE CAMERAS IMPROVE -- YOU'RE GOING TO GET BETTER OUTCOMES IN AND MORE FINELY TUNED MATCHES AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IF THE SOFTWARE. CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. AT AN ACCELERATED PACE AS IT HAS -- THAT IS ALSO GOING TO AGAIN IMPROVE WHICH WHICH REALLY ALSO KIND OF UNDERSCORES DO WE REALLY NEED A BAND NOW OR ARE THERE SOME OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REGULATE -- THE USAGE OF THE TECHNOLOGY OR SET SOME STANDARDS IN PLACE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY MAYBE NEEDS TO MEET CERTAIN THRESHOLDS OF ACCURACY. IN ORDER FOR TO BE CONSIDERED -- USEFUL. AS WE UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT NOW YOU CANNOT USE FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SOFTWARE. TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE TO MAKE AN ARREST -- SO. PRACTICALLY SPEAKING WHAT THE USE WOULD BE IS. YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE SOME SORT OF COLD CASE AND WE NEED TO TRY AND NARROW DOWN WHO WAS AT THE SCENE -- SO WE CAN HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS -- BUT THE THOSE THESE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE I THINK -- SPOKEN TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT WE AGREE IT SHOULDN'T BE USED TO TRACK PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE ETHNICALLY ETHNICITY -- RELIGIOUS OR POLITICAL VIEWS -- AND MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF STANDARD -- THAT SHOULD BE UTILIZED IN ALL THE PERHAPS A REASONABLE SUSPICION SUSPICION. THAT EXIST THAT ONLY A SERIES OF VIOLENT CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED SO WE'RE WE'RE OPEN TO TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT IT WE THINK THERE'S A WAY -- TO REDUCE FEARS THAT OF A POLICE STATE THAT IS GOING TO BE IN CONTINUOUS REAL TIME. SURVEILLANCE -- WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SO THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE. M. WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND NINE WILL. GO AHEAD WITNESSES NOT. MY MENTOR MEMBERS RANGE FROM WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION LINE OUR COMMENTS WITH THE SPEAKERS HERE AND RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. MORE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ON ON WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE WHOLE SHARE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT LOS ANGELES OLYMPIC GAMES WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. I'M SURE RAINY PERIOD WE HAVE A PARKING OPPOSE IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SORRY MANAGER MEMBERS ARRANGEMENT AGAIN -- THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF CHAD BIANCO'S ASKED ME -- TO INFORM YOU OF HIS OPPOSITION AS WELL THANKS. PART ANY OTHERS. NINETEEN NINETY WE HAVE SAT. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I APOLOGIZE I WAS A LITTLE LATE ON MY NAME IS SUMMER HARADA WITH THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS. I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO SUPPORT THE BILL -- AND HELP RAISE AWARENESS FOR THE CAUSE -- OFFER THIS BODY IN TERMS OF THE FACIAL RECOGNITION ABUSE THAT OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCACY GROUP HAS BEEN SEEING -- IN CHINA IN TERMS OF FACIAL RECOGNITION BEING USED -- TO OVEN PURVEY OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AGAINST AN ETHNIC MINORITY -- AND ONGOING RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS PROFILING WE'RE SEEING ON WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU ALL RIGHT [inaudible] SHE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS FROM THE DíAS WE HAVE A MOTION. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YES SAYS SENATOR JACKSON. THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE SAID IN HERE ALL OF THE OPPOSITION BUT I IT -- IT'S OF MY ANDERSON IS THE REASON AT LEAST YOU'RE SENSIBLE REASON THAT YOU. OUR TO BRING IN THIS BILL IS BECAUSE THIS. THIS TECHNOLOGY AT THIS PINT TIME IS INACCURATE. AND IN ITS. NASCENT. US STATE. I AND THEREFORE RATHER THAN. GO THROUGH THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGISLATION -- OR RATHER WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION. BEING INACCURATE AND CAUSING ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS. THE GOAL IS TO JUST OUTRIGHT. BANDIT. ON THE OTHER HAND [inaudible] HAS WAS. ARTICULATED BY THE OPPOSITION -- OR THE OF THE LA DA -- REPRESENT PROTECTIVELY THAT. THERE MAY BE SOME GOOD PURPOSES FOR AND TO JUST OUTRIGHT DISMISS IT MAY BE SORT OF IT AND INAPPROPRIATE. OF SORT OF A IN A HEAVY HANDED APPROACH TO THIS AT THIS POINT TIME -- CLEARLY A LOT OF POSSIBLE USES ARE OF CONCERN. AND IN A WE ARE WORRIED ENOUGH AND SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR USING THIS KIND OF INFORMATION AND WHERE WE DON'T SEEM TO OF INDICATED THE SAME CONCERN THAT WE ARE WHEN IT COMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT -- ARE THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE USE OF THESE BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AND MAYBE IT'S THE OPPOSITION THAT I SHOULD BE ASKING WHEN THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY. SERVICE LONG FIRST FORCED ME YOU MENTIONED -- IDENTIFYING SUSPECTS OR MISSING PERSONS -- ARE THERE OTHER INSTANCES WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY. YOU BELIEVE IF IT BECOMES BETTER PERFECTED. MIGHT SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST WE CAN HEAR FROM -- ONE OPPOSITION AND THEN I WILL ALLOW THE I'D APPRECIATE. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DILUTION LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE -- CERTAINL MISSING PERSONS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- WE'VE CONSIDERED AND TALKED ABOUT EXTENSIVELY. THE OTHER WOULD BE INSTANCES WHERE -- AN OFFICER HAS AN ENCOUNTER -- WE WE WE SOUGHT IN A LATE LAST YEAR AN OFFICER AN ENCOUNTER -- WITH SOMEONE AT THE OF OSTENSIBLY PULLED OVER FOR TRAFFIC VIOLATION THAT RESULTED -- IN THE LOSS OF THAT OFFICER'S LIFE -- YOU COULD CLEARLY DOWNLOADING TAKE THE BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE BACK. TO THE STATION IN AN INSTANCE LIKE THAT. BOMB BUT WHAT SHE WOULD BE CONSIDERING AT THAT POINT TIME IS -- OKAY WILL LET'S USE OUR HUMANIZED TO TRY AND DETERMINE -- IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO LOOKS LIKE OUR LET'S PUT IT OUT ON TELEVISION -- LET'S DISTRIBUTED TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHO THIS PERSON IS -- AND WHILE THAT YOU KNOW HAS BEEN VIABLE IN THE PAST IN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE VIABLE -- I THINK WE'VE HAD IN A LOT OF DEBATE IN THIS SPACE ABOUT THE THE ACCURACY OF EYEWITNESS -- FOOTAGE AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO WE WE REALLY SEE IT AS JUST KIND OF ANOTHER TOOL -- TO HELP US IN THAT ENDEAVOR AND WITH THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IF I MAY THAT BUT THAT'S WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FACIAL NECESSARILY YOU HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF SOMEONE YOU HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF AND THAT'S NOT WHAT'S AT ISSUE HERE AND IS IT. IT IS IN MY WAY CORRECT THAT. THAT THAT CONTINUES BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE MAKING A RECORD OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT TO USE THE BIOMETRIC. IS THE ISSUE -- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT IS PERSUASIVE AS TO WHY WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING EXCEPTIONS TO THIS I'M LOOKING -- FOR IF I MAY. THERE MAY BE A VERY GOOD REASON SUGAR MEANT. GOOD SOLID OF POLICE OF PURPOSE IN USING BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS WHAT I'VE HEARD IS RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE INACCURATE. AND TROUBLESOME AS FAR AS WHAT THE LIMITATIONS WOULD BE. SO I'M TRYING TO SEE ARE THERE ARE INSTANCES GOING FORWARD WHERE. THIS REALLY MAY BE A VALUABLE TOOL AND THAT WE MIGHT NOT WANT TO CHOOSE UNIVERSALLY BAN IT. OR INSTEAD OF LIMITED UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IT CAN BE SHOWN TO BE ACCURATE AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE A LEGITIMATE ASSISTANCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S MY QUANDARY AT THE MOMENT RIGHT YEAH I I THINK WHAT WE ARE NOT HERE PLEASE THANK YOU ARE YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE NOTE THAT THIS BILL COVERS BODY CAMERAS ONLY IT IS NOT A BLANKET BAN. ON FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE -- IN DO YOU MAY BRIEFLY ANSWER AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM THAT WHETHER THE SUPPORTERS ONE RESPOND. ABSOLUTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AMENDMENT XIV TEENY -- AS WE THE AS WE KIND OF TOUCHED ON THE THE BIOMETRIC SOFTWARE -- AS IT'S CURRENTLY USE IT'S NOT USED IN REAL TIME. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT IT WOULD BE USING WOULD BE USED FOR THE AFTER THE FACT. AND BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MORE SPECIFICALLY -- THE THE THE MISSING PERSONS ISSUE IS IS ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT THE LA POLICE. PROTECTIVE LEAGUE IS RAISED AT THIS PRESENT TIME WHERE IT WOULD PROVIDE INSTANT VALUE -- WE BELIEVE IN TRYING -- TO IDENTIFY AND OBVIOUSLY REUNITE PEOPLE THANK YOU. MISTER KING WOULD YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS YEAH IT IS VERY I THINK JUST VERY BRIEFLY AND AND BROADLY. ON IF YOU COULD IMAGINE ANY CITY THAT DECIDED TO DEPLOY HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF CAMERAS ON THEIR STREET -- THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A FAIRLY ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS AND EVALUATION IF THEY IF THEY WANT TO DO A SANTA BARBARA BERKELEY OR LA. OR IN IRVINE THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A FAILY ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS. AND REALLY DELIBERATE WHETHER OR NOT THE COMMUNITY FELT IT APPROPRIATE TO HAVE. CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE ON THEIR STREETS YES IT WOULD HELP WITH INVESTIGATIONS YES IT WOULD HELP OF MISSING PERSONS. BUT I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE CITY. IN THE STATE THAT'S REALLY MADE THIS CHOICE. BUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS IF YOU ACTIVATE. THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IN OFFICER. BODY CAMBER'S. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. YOU ARE PUTTING HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS [inudible] OF CAMERAS. WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THAT'S NOT ACCURATE. ON OUR STREETS INSTANTLY. WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC DELIBERATION. WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC PROCESS WITHOUT ANY UNDERSTANDING OR AGREEMENT AS TO WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT BE USED. FOR THAT THAT IS REALLY SORT OF WHAT'S AT STAKE SO -- AGAIN UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT -- THEY'VE ONLY RECENTLY -- ENGAGED IN THIS LEGISLATION SO WE'RE HAPPY. TO CONTINUE WORK WITH THEM AND SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY AMENDMENTS THAT. WE COULD ACCEPT IT HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING WITH THEM THAT THIS POINT. THAT IS REALLY WHAT'S AT STAKE IT IS IS ABOUT A COMPLETE LACK OF PUBLIC PROCESS OF DEPLOYING THIS. SOFTWARE. ON OUR STREETS WITHOUT US EVEN KNOWING [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- MAKAYLA MAY I THINK WE THE AUTHORS SUFFICIENT AND WONDERFUL SO FAR.

AND BECAUSE OF UNTIMELY INVESTIGATIONS AND INCONSISTENT DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES. MANY OF THESE ATTACKS ALSO WENT UNPUNISHED. AB TWO NINETY FOUR REQUIRES CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES TO PROVIDE REGULAR TRAINING TO STAFF IN RESPONDING TO GAS ATTACKS INCLUDING A NOTICE OF THE RIGHTS.

IN SUPPORT. MORNING RANGER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORT AND ALSO FOR RIVERSIDE CHURCH OF YOUNG CAN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I'M ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT AM I WANTED TO INDICATE THAT I APPRECIATE THE BILL AT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM I WOULD ALSO NOTE. THAT. AND AND OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITY STAFF WHETHER IN COUNTY JAILS OR STATE PRISONS DO DESERVE TO HAVE TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE. I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE'S ALSO BEEN PUBLICITY ABOUT INCIDENTS UNFORTUNATELY WHERE. COUNTY CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS HAVE IN EFFECT ENCOURAGED INMATES -- TO WHILE WHILE THE TERM GASSING IN OUR STATUTE REFERS ONLY TO THAT WHICH OCCURS TO THE CARD. THE AS A AS A JUST POPULAR REFERENCE IT COULD HPPEN TO ANYONE AND THERE HAS BEEN UNFORTUNATELY PUBLICITY -- ACTUALLY DOCUMENTED INCIDENTS WHERE SOME COUNTY CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS HAVE IN EFFECT ENCOURAGED SOME INMATES TO GAS OTHER INMATES. SO I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ YOU'RE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT EVERYONE WHO WOULD PIECE POSSIBLY SUBJECT TO THIS IS PROTECTED. AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHORS AGREED TO TAKE PROVIDE THAT IN IN MAY TWO SIX BOWS. TO AT THIS THE SAME WAY AS A GUARD COULD BE I HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TESTED FOR THE SAME THING CITY CORRECTIONAL OFFICER WOULD. REQUIRE SAID THE INMATE RECEIVE NOTICE OF THE RIGHT TO BE TESTED. AND REQUIRES THAT A ON OUR STATE PRISON OR COUNTY JAIL DOCUMENT ALL INCIDENTS SAME AS YOUR AS IS EXISTS THERE NOW IN THE BILL. FOR THE CORRECTION OFFICERS WERE AN INMATE INTENTIONALLY PLACES ARE THROWS. AT SUCH MATERIAL ON ANOTHER INMATE SO APPRECIATE THAT YOU ACCEPTED THOSE AMENDMENTS AND LET ME SEE IF THERE'S AY. OTHER COMMENTS OR A SENATOR OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION SENATOR JACKSON'S. THIS IS A AN APPALLING PRACTICE -- AND I WONDER. WELL WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT. AGAINST THE RAMIFICATIONS OF IT WHAT IS BEING DONE TO TRY. TO PREVENT THIS AND TO I MEAN. I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE AS HUMAN BEINGS ARE INCLINED TO COMMIT THIS KIND OF OR ENGAGE IN THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING DONE ANY RESEARCH DONE ANY. TRAINING DONE TO TRY TO DISCOURAGE. THIS REALLY. HIS ANIMAL BEHAVIOR -- THIS IS JUST OF MAYBE I'M NAIVE BUT THE I FIND THE SHOCKING BEHAVIOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND EXAMPLES OF THIS IN PRISON WHAT WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON THAT. THE PEOPLE. FIND IT APPROPRIATE OR NECESSARY OR EVEN DESIRABLE TO BEHAVE IN THIS FASHION. HAS THERE BEEN ANY DOES THE AUTHOR WANT TO RESPOND. I THINK A LOT OF IT -- CAME TO THE AUDIT. THAT WAS DONE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE ISSUE BECAUSE WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT IT RIGHT BUT I THINK THE OTHER PHONE LOT OF THE INCONSISTENCIES RIGHT. SOME DEPARTMENTS NOT REALLY FULLY -- ADVISING STAFF OR INMATES ABOUT WHAT GOES ON IN WHITES GOING ON SO THIS IS TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH STANDARD. TO AT LEAST START TO NOT ONLY WORK WITH OFFICERS IN THE DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO WITH THE INMATES. ARE WHY THIS IS HAPPENING AND TO DISCOURAGE THAT PRACTICE AND NOT ENOUGH ONE OF MY OF FOLKS HERE IN SUPPORTER LIKE TO ADD TO THAT AS WELL I'M NOT SURE IF THEY YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT. WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE -- BEFORE FROM WE CAN DO TO START. MINIMIZING THOSE THE TYPES OF INCIDENTS IS NOT ONLY AT THE COUNTY FACILITIES BUT AT THE STATE FACILITIES AS WELL AND I THINK. MORE READY LIKE ABOUT IT IS SOME OF THE INMATES THAT OR IN THE CASE COUNTY FACILITIES OR ONES OR WERE IN STATE PRISONS AND I THINK THAT CULTURE IS KIND OF COME DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVELS IN THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AS YOU SEE THROUGHOUT ALL THE COUNTY FACILITIES BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE IN MY THREE OR MORE KEPT AT THE STATE FACILITIES AND I THINK FROM THAT CULTURE NOW IS WENT INTO THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE CUSTARD FOR SALUTE PLEASE SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU ARE YOU THINK IN RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE -- WHEN PEOPLE ARE TREATED LIKE ANIMALS WHEN PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN ANIMAL LIKE CONDITIONS -- WHEN WE JUST CAME FROM THE -- DISPLAY OUTSIDE WHERE YOU LOOK AT WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE LOCKED THAT MAY NOT HAVE HOPE. IN TERMS OF OUR EXTENDED SENTENCES. ALL THAT WE HAVE PILED ON TO THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED -- WHILE I WAS HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL I THINK IT'S AT A POOR PRACTICE -- TO GO TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW DO WE GET THERE WHEN I LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE HAVE SANCTION THE PEOPLE LIVE. IT'S NOT SURPRISING. TRAGIC BUT NOT SURPRISING MENTAL I THINK OUR WORK TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS IN ADDITION TO LEGISLATION LIKE THIS WILL BE HELPFUL. SENATOR JACKSON YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT WAS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET AT HIS SET. I DON'T KNOW TWENTY MOTHERS OR FATHERS TO TEACH THEIR CHILDREN THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR SO HOW DOES HE GET TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BEHAVE THAT WAY AND I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT. BE SOMETHING WE LOOK AT AS WELL BECAUSE I DON'T. I DON'T THINK THAT IS CALLING ON PEOPLE TO BE THEIR BEST AND TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'LL HAVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND INCIDENTS OF THAT IN THE LA COUNTY JAIL TELLS ME. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WAY WERE CONDUCTING -- ARE -- INCARCERATIONS SYSTEM AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL BE LOOKED AT AS WELL INTO. WITH THAT I TAKE COMMAND CHAIR FOR INDULGING ME I I JUST FIND THIS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING I'M. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RODRIGUEZ WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. OUR SPECTRUM TROUBLE THANK YOU EXCELLENT.

SOME OF THESE DUTIES INCLUDE CONDUCTING ROUTINE DAILY TRANSPORTS SUCH AS TRANSPORTING INMATES TO AND FROM COURTS AND POSSIBLY BEING AVAILABLE TO ASSIST PATROL WHEN NEEDED TO TRANSPORT.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT THE BILL THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY OF MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAMINATIONS. FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS. FIRST LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT MY STAFF HAS WORKED OUT AN AMENDMENT WITH THE COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. THAT WILL REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION. CURRENTLY THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES CALLOW YES TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE REIMBURSED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT TO OFFSET THE COST OF A NON INVESTIGATIVE. EXAM EVERY FIVE YEARS. THE AGREED UPON AMENDMENT WOULD PROHIBIT CALLOW YES FROM INCREASING THE CAP BY MORE THAN DETERMINED REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNT. SO WITH THE CAP CURRENTLY SET AT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS CAL -- YES COULD INCREASE IT TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AND THEN IN FIVE YEARS TO SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND SO ON AFTER AND DURING A SEXUAL ASSAULT. TIMELY ACCESS TO TRAUMA INFORMED IN EVIDENCE BASED CARE CAN PREVENT ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND ALLOW FOR THE PROPER COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE. AB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WOULD CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ACCESS BY ENSURING THAT EXAM TEAMS ARE PAID FULLY FOR CONDUCTING EXAMS AND BY CLARIFYING THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS MAY PERFORM EXAMS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO OF THE EXISTING LAW TO REFLECT CURRENT BEST PRACTICES ENHANCE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR EXAMINERS PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF FORENSIC RECORDS. AND GENERALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS. AB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION MADE UP OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAM TEAMS SEXUAL ASSAULT INVESTIGATORS CRIME LAB DIRECTORS HOSPITALS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WITH ME TODAY ARE KIM WALKER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAMINER'S ASSOCIATION. AND MELINDA WHEELER ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS IGNORE SPECIALISTS INC I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU GO AHEAD WITNESSES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOUR TIME TODAY. MY NAME IS KIM WALKER AND I'M A BOARD MEMBER AND THE CALIFORNIA'S SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAMINER'S ASSOCIATION A CALIPHATE. REPRESENTS THE FORTY NINE EXAM TEAMS IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. I AM ALSO THE PROGRAM MANAGER THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SEXUAL SUFFERANCE EXAM OR SAFE PROGRAM. WHERE WE SERVE PATIENTS FROM SANTA CLARA SAN BENITO SANTA CRUZ COUNTY? MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M A CURRENTLY PRACTICING SEXUAL SOUGHT NURSE EXAMINER. PURPOSE OF AB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT IS TO AMEND AND CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE OF THE PENAL CODE WHICH OUTLINES THE PARAMETERS FOR THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY EXAMS. TO SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. IMPORTANTLY IT CORRECTS THE LANGUAGE SURROUNDING THE PAYMENT FOR MEDICAL EVIDENTIARY SAM'S UNDER THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. THAT IS INCREASINGLY BEING MISINTERPRETED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS APPLICABLE TO ALL EXAMS. IF LEFT UNCORRECTED EXAM TEAMS ARE AT RISK OF SHUTTING DOWN IS THIS WILL RESTRICT ONE OF THE ONLY FUNDING OPTIONS IN THE STATE AVAILABLE. FOR SAFETY AIMS TO ACCESS. SURVIVOR ACCESS TO MEDICAL OF AN INTRIGUING AND STATEWIDE IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE. WE NEED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN MORE QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS O PERFORM THESE VITAL EXAMS. ENSURE THESE PROFESSIONALS HAVE ACCESS TO BASIC ADVANCED AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING AS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL. NOT ONLY IN SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT ALSO IN STRANGULATION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN MY PARTNER VIOLENCE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AN ELDER AND CHILD ABUSE. AS HE'S RARELY OCCUR IN ISOLATION. RECENT INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND PASSED THAT FOCUS ON THE TESTING OF SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT FROM DNA ANALYSIS. WE CANNOT FORGET THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS ARE BEING COLLECTED BY THE SAME QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. WHO ARE SEEING AND TREATING SURVIVORS AND THEIR QUEUE CRISIS? THE EARLIER SURVIVOR CAN ACCESS A QUALIFIED FORENSIC EXAMINER WHO IS APPROPRIATELY TRAINED EXPERIENCED AND SUPPORTED. THE HIGHER THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE BETTER THE OUTCOMES FOR THE PATIENT. CHANGES PROPOSED BY THIS BILL ARE NEEDED TO INSURE THAT WE DELIVER THE BEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND OPTIMIZE THE RESPONSE THAT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BOTH REQUIRE AND DESERVE. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S MELINDA WHEELER AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING CAL SAFE AS WELL AS A FORENSIC NURSE SPECIALIST WHICH IS A PRIVATELY OWNED COMPANY LOCATED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND ORANGE COUNTY -- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WE HAVE SEEN OVER TWENTY THOUSAND VICTIMS DURING THAT TIME. I I STARTED OUT IN THE FIELD AS A RAPE CRISIS ADVOCATE AND SAW THAT THERE IS A NEED TO IMPROVE MEDICAL SERVICES FOR VICTIMS -- HOSPITALS JUST COULD NOT AFFORD TO HAVE A SPECIALIZED TEAM TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR AN UNCERTAIN AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS. WHEN THE VIAL OF BILL WAS PASSED? AND I WAS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE TO FIND A WAY TO IMPLEMENT. OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND AT THAT TIME WE DEVELOPED A NEW EXAM FORM AND A PROTOCOL. BUT WE DID THE BEST WE COULD THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP AT THAT TIME WAS ACTUALLY A COMPROMISE THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND IT WAS TO GET THESE EXAMS OFF THE GROUND AND GET THEM STARTED. WE WERE TO RE EVALUATE HOW IT WAS GOING IN TWO YEARS NOW IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS. THE LAW IS COMPLICATED AND CONFUSING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT EVEN AFTER NUMEROUS TRAININGS. I NEED TO RE EXPLAIN THIS LAW EACH AND EVERY TIME A VICTIM REQUEST THIS TYPE OF EXAM OPTION AND HAD TO COME OUT AND PICK UP THE EVIDENCE CAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY NEED TO PAY FOR THIS EXAM AT ALL IF THEY DO NOT GET TO INVESTIGATE THE CRIME. ONE AGENCY I WORK WITH THE REFUSES TO PAY ANYTHING IF THEY CAN I INTERVIEW THE VICTIM. I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT DID HAPPEN IN THEIR CITY AND THAT IT WAS A REAL RATE. ANOTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS OKAY WITH PAIN IF I DON'T GO OVER FIVE OF THESE EXAMS EACH YEAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BUDGET. POLICE HAVE BUDGETS AND THEY'RE ALWAYS INADEQUATE. THESE EXAMS COULD NOT BE DONE AT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR YOUR EXAM TEAMS WHO HAVE SOME EXAM TEAMS OF HAD TO DECLINE DOING THEM AT ALL IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. WITH THE THOUGHT WHAT IF THESE TEAMS STRUGGLE TO EVEN SURVIVE. HOSPITALS IN PLEASE CANNOT KEEP BEARING THIS BURDEN ALONE. APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

AND THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME WE WILL NOW GO TO ITEM SEVEN AB SIX TWENTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING COLLEAGUES OF I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A. B.. SIX TWENTY REDUCE SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD. AND THIS ARISES IS DISTRICT BATTERY YOUNG MAN DIED INEXPLICABLY IN THE NIGHT IN THE EIGHTH DECEMBER DISTRICT OVER YEARS BACK. A SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD IS NOT WHOLLY NEW. BUT IT DOES HAVE A VERY LOW INCIDENCE ONE POINT. TWO OCCURRENCES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN. ON EARLY IN ANY CASE WHERE YOU HAVE SUDDEN INFANT DEATH. OF THE LAW REQUIRES SAID TO SHOULD BE RETAINED THE PARENTS BE ADVISED OF THIS. TO SUPPORT RESEARCH AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WENT ON AS A YOUNG MAN ACTUALLY I FIRST ENCOUNTERED SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME BECAUSE IN MRS BROKAW LOST A BABY. A WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER IN THE SEVENTIES -- SO THAT TYPE REQUIREMENT OR DOES NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD SO BEYOND JUST BEING AN INFANT. UP TO TWELVE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS THE SOUTHERN SPAIN DEATH. DATA ENHANCEMENT AWARENESS ACT TO RAISE AWARENESS BETTER SENATE. OF UNEXPLAINED DEATH FOR CHILDREN -- OLDER THAN TWELVE MONTHS. THIS BILL DEFINED SO DENSE BRAIN DEATH IN CHARTER STATUTE REQUIRES CORNERSTONE FOR THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN. OF A CHILD WHO DIES OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE. OF TAKING TISSUE SAMPLE FOR FOR PURPOSES OF FOR THE MASTICATION. SO IN ESSENCE IT DOVETAILS WITH THE FEDERAL ACT HAT'S BEEN LOST SINCE. TWENTY FOURTEEN I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO PRESENT THIS BILL HERE AND I HAVES WITNESSES SUPPORT. KNOWS THE FAMILY. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MISTER CHAIR. OUR MINDS GARY COOPER AND IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION I'M REPRESENTING THE FAMILY BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT -- THE WIND CHILLS LIVED ACROSS THE STREET BEING WRESTLED ACROSS THE STREET FROM ME -- SUFFER THIS TRAGEDY AND AT TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND WE'VE ASKED MR COOLEY ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS TO HELP GET INVOLVED IN THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THE YOUNG MAN WHO AT THE TIME WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD WENT TO SLEEP IN THE EVENING HIS PARENTS WENT TO WAKE HIM UP IN THE MORNING AND UNFORTUNATELY HIT PASSED AWAY. AND WHEN THE POLICE IN THE CHAIR IN THE CORNER CAME THEY REALLY DID NOT ADVISE THE PARENTS THAT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE SOME TISSUE SAMPLES AND TO DETERMINE WHAT POSSIBLY COULD BE CAUSING THIS ULTIMATELY BECAUSE THEY HAD FRIENDS THAT WERE -- MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND FRIENDS BECAUSE I AM INTEREST -- THEY DID THIS AND THEY'RE STILL STILL NOT 1100% SURE AS TO WHAT HAPPENED BUT THEY'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT CLOSER. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION THE SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH TO CHILD DACIAN AS MR COOLEY JUST SAID IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HAD PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. TO RECOGNIZE SUCH ISSUE DC. SIDS BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME S. U. DC IS A FAIRLY NEW -- EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN AROUND IT'S FAIRLY NEW BEING RECOGNIZED AND SO SIMPLY WHAT THIS BILL DIES IS PUT IN STATUTE U. DC AND EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS AND SUGGEST THAT THE THE CORNERS. AT TELL THE FAMILY THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TISSUE SAMPLES WE'RE NOT TRYING TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO ANY MORE THAN JUST PUT IN STATUTE RIGHT NOW. SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS UTC THE EYES AND WITH THAT I WOULD TO ASK FOR AND I WROTE. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MR COOLEY VIEW THAT MOVE THE MICROPHONE. FOR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING ON MISTER KERRY MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH FLORA BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION -- OF CORNERS WE I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE I'M I DO WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH MR COOLIES OFFICE OVER SEVERAL YEARS -- ON THIS MATTER AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE ON HIS OPEN DOOR POLICY AND ON DEPLOYED YEAH WE HAVE TO BE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS OFFICE REGARDING THIS ISSUE -- WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT DEATH OF A CHILD IS OBVIOUSLY VERY TRAUMATIC SPECIALLY ON WHEN THE REASON IS UNKNOWN -- BUT WE MASS RESPECTFULLY CONTINUE OPPOSITION TO DISPEL ID TO THE WAY THAT THE BILL IS WRITTEN -- WE DON'T NECESSARILY OBJECT TO HAD LETTING A PARENT KNOW THAT IT TISSUE SAMPLES SHOULD BE TAKEN -- BUT JUST THE DEFINITION OF THE AT AN UNEXPECTED DEAD IN CHILDHOOD IN STATUTE IS ATOP THE PROBLEM WE HAVE. A RIGHT NOW BOTH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND TO SOCIETY FOR PEDIATRIC PATHOLOGY HAVE PROTOCOLS FOR INVESTIGATING SETS BUT THERE IS NO SUCH PROTOCOL FOR ADAMS -- FOR DECIDE AN UNEXPECTED THAT IN CHILDHOOD SO -- THAT WHAT THAT IS WHAT WE FIND PROBLEMATIC -- WHEN A CORNER OR MEDICAL EXAMINER SIGNS A DEATH CERTIFICATE WOULD APPEARS ON THE CERTIFICATE FOR CAUSE OF DEATH MASS BE CODED TO A STANDARD -- THAT'S CONTAINED IN THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES. AND ON THIS AT CODY'S USE AND IT'S CLASSIFIED WEEK TOP CLASS FINAL TALLY DATA FROM DEATH CERTIFICATES. ON THIS -- ICD TEN IS A COPYRIGHTED BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WHICH AWESOME PUBLISHES THE CLASSIFICATION A DICEY TEN WAS DOUBLE UP FOLLOWING A THOROUGH -- EVALUATION BY TECHNICAL ADVISORY PANEL AND EXTENSIVE ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION WITH PHYSICIAN GROUPS CLINICAL -- CODERS AND OTHERS TO ENSURE CLINICAL ACCURACY AND UTILITY AND SIT APPEARS ON ICD TEN CODE BUT NO SUCH CODE APPEARS FOR S. U. DC -- SO IT'S EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC TO DEFINE S. U. D. C. AS IN YOU STANDARD IN STATUTE WITHOUT IT HAVING BEEN VETTED FOR PURPOSES OF INCLUSION. ON THE ICD -- TEN SO THIS IS WHERE -- WE COME APART WITH THE AUTHOR I WAS WANTING -- TO ASKED THE CORNERS TO ACT. I TELL THE PARENTS THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO TAKE A TWO STAGE YOU SAMPLED BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING -- TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS WITHOUT ANY KIND OF A A GUIDELINE IN PLACE -- SO RESPECTFULLY WE OPPOSE WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF THAT MEN MEN MEANT THAT WOULD. HELP US GOOD NEUTRAL ON THE BILL THANK YOU. I KNOW SENATOR MITCHELL MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BUT LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SENDER RITUAL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE WITH A PERSONAL ISSUE IN TERMS OF ITS IMPACT IN A FAMILY HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION -- ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOARD WITH REGARD TO DEATH CERTIFICATES IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS IN TERMS OF A RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION. AND SOUL HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ISSUES TECHNOLOGY THAT -- IT'S NOT BEEN DEFINED -- BEYOND WHAT YOU'RE TO BE DOING STATUTES AGAIN IS IT AND IT DO YOU THINK THAT DEFINING STATUTE IS THE APPROPRIATE FIRST STEP TO THE IMPACT. THE TRIGGER THE PROCESS SEES THAT THE OPPONENT IS SUGGESTED NEED TO TAKE PLACE. WELL I THINK OF FIRST OPPOSITION THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS FOR THE NATIONAL BODY WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THE RECOGNITION OF THIS IN FEDERAL STATUTE. IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD ASSERT THAT TO SAY IT IS SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD IS ITSELF AN EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSE OF DEATH. THE SO I DON'T THINK IT ACTUALLY ISN'T I I JUST IT IT DOES NOT. IT DOESN'T SPECIFY WHAT WAS THE MECHANISM -- THE BIOLOGY THE MECHANICS THAT PRODUCED THE DEATH. SO I DON'T THINK IT IS EXPLANATORY OF CAUSE OF DEATH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS ACTUALLY. TO ENSURE THAT AS WE DO A SUDDEN INFANT DEATH. THE PARENTS ARE ALERTED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING A TISSUE SAMPLE. YOU KNOW THIS IS YOU HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN. YOUR LIFE IS NORMAL. AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU REALIZE YOUR CHILD IS NEVER GONNA COME WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY TO COOLEY I GET THAT AND ON THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL I'M WITH YOU BUT MY POINT AS DOES YOUR BILL GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. THE FIRST STEP OF EMPOWERING PARENTS WITH THE INFORMATION ASKING FOR TISSUE SAMPLE I GET THE IMPRESSION OF MY GUYS AND LEAVE THE LANGUAGE OF YOUR BILL. DANGEROUSLY GOES BEYOND THAT FIRST IMPORTANT STEP AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT DOES DO THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IT. FORCES A CATEGORY OF EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF DEATH. AS ASCERTAINED BY THE BEST EFFORTS OF THE CORNER THE SHERIFF WHOEVER THAT WOULD BE MEDICAL EXAMINER I THANK YOU I'M SURE. SUMMIT COOLEY -- WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND THE? SOCIETY FOR PEDIATRIC PATHOLOGY TO GET THEM TO ADD THIS CATEGORY. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL I DO NOT KNOW. I MEAN THEY SUPPORTED THE BILL IDENTIFYING THIS AS A PHENOMENON. THAT WAS WORTHY OF FURTHER RESEARCH. WHICH PROMPTED THE BIPARTISAN ENACTMENT. OF THE BILL SO IT PROMOTES RESEARCH. AND THESE THIS TYPE OF NOTICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA ONE POINT TWO INCHES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN WILL PROVIDE A FUND OF REESE. RESEARCH A BOWL TISSUE SAMPLES FUNDING ALIGNS WITH THE NATIONAL INITIATIVE -- AND BUT I DO NOT KNOW MORE THAN I MISTER COOPER DO YOU HAVE ANY OBSERVATIONS ON FOR SOME OF THE BASICALLY WHEN A ACTUAL BOND. THROUGH THE CHAIR ON THE MANAGER. SHARE MADAM CHAIR WITH EACH YEAR -- BASICALLY THE NATIONALS -- THREATEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH COALITION -- THEY HAVE WORKED ON A NATIONAL LEVEL WITH MEDICAL EXAMINERS TO TRY TO INCREASE THE DATA COLLECTION. YES -- IN ANSWER TO A SENATOR MITCHELL'S CONCERN AND TO SENATOR -- MORE LAX CONCERN I I DON'T KNOW AS MR COOLEY STATE I DON'T KNOW QUITE YET WHETHER THEY'RE GETTING READY TO ESTABLISH CODES AS SHE IS. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CORONER'S -- SUGGESTED I DON'T KNOW THAT BUT I DO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED A LARGE DATA COLLECTION FACILITY AND WITH. DEALING WITH SO AS TO THE C. CENSUS IS TAKEN EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN SINCE THE BILL WAS SIGNED IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SMITH FULLER THEN WHAT IS YOUR ORGANIZATION DOING TO ADD THIS IS A CATEGORY. YOU MAY RESPOND. I THANK YOU -- WERE UP WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T ANSWER WHAT'S BEING DONE NATIONALLY AND I CAN ANSWER A WHAT'S BEING DONE AS AN ASSOCIATION TO WORK ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL. TO MAKE SURE THIS GETS ON THE LIST -- BUT BUT AGAIN WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO DOING THIS ISSUE SAMPLE BUT WE ARE OPPOSED UNTIL THIS GETS ON THE NATIONAL REGISTRY WE CAN'T. ON THE WAY WE CO THINGS WE JUST. IT WILL NOT GIVE US THE ABILITY TO APPROPRIATELY CODE AND DO THE JOB THAT WE NEED TO DO SO I MEAN I'M HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE WOULD WHAT'S BEING DONE ON THE STATE LEVEL TO WORK WITH THE NATIONAL LEVEL. TO MAKE SURE THIS GETS ON THIS ODD GETS A COATING THAT IS NEEDED. GREAT THE NUMBER IS STILL THE FLOOR. MR COOLEY I'M JUST CURIOUS IF PERHAPS WE COULD DO A RESOLUTION. TO TO TO GET THE ICD TEN MANUAL UPDATED FOR THIS CATEGORY. GET SOMETHING AT LEAST ON THEIR RADAR. TO GET THE BALL MOVING WELL I THINK YOU COULD DO THAT MAY I THINK THE YOU HAVE AN ISSUE THAT. SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD. DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE MECHANISM I AT THIS POINT. OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME IS AN IDENTIFIABLE MEDICAL BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA WHERE IT IS NOT UNDERSTOOD THE MECHANISM FOR NOT UNDERSTOOD. SO I A IT SEEMS. TO ME PREMATURE THAT YOU WOULD MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF IDENTIFYING THIS AS AN ACTUAL BECAUSE A HERE IN CALIFORNIA STATE DO THEY RADIS RADIS CHILDREN HOSPITAL IS DOING RESEARCH IN THIS AREA. THE BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL DOING RESEARCH IN THIS AREA. THAT IS IN SUING FROM THE FEDERAL LACK FROM [inaudible] TWENTY FOURTEEN ON BUT UNTIL OUR I DON'T KNOW HOW A MEDICAL EXAMINER CORONER SHERIFF WOULD DISPLACING WAS REALLY -- WHETHER A RESOLUTION WOULD ALSO YOU COULD CERTAIN ALL I MEAN I I RESOLUTION WOULD BE COMMENDABLE TO KIND OF SPUR THAT WORK. THIS IS ON THE ISSUE OF CAN WE ESTABLISH A ROUTINE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THIS FACT PATTERN SHOWS UP. THAT PARENTS WHO ARE IN TRAUMA TO A PARTY I DO THINK WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE THE BILL DOES I THINK WE TO FOR QUESTIONS WITH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IN YOUR MORAL. OKAY SO -- WHEN SECOND BEFORE CALLING SENATOR JACKSON I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE QUICK EXPLANATION SO THE -- OUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANTSTO ANALYZE THE BILL WE OF COURSE I NOTED IMMEDIATELY THAT THIS BILL WOULD BEEN VETOED. A IDENTICAL BILL IT'S BEEN VETOED TWICE AND SO I ASKED THE CONSULTANTS. TO TAKE A VERY GOOD LOOK AT WHETHER IT DID GO BEYOND -- CODES AS WAS SUGGESTED BY THE OPPOSITION AND WHETHER -- IT DID AS SIMPLY AS WAS DESCRIBED MAKE THE SUGGESTION OF THE TISSUE SAMPLES AND IF YOU AND NOTE ON PAGE TWO OF THE ACTUAL TEXT OF THE BILL. AND YOU READ IT SERVICE IT'S BASICALLY PRETTY SHORT IT DOES ONLY THAT AND DOES NOT CHANGE CODES. AND SO BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GO ABOVE AND BEYOND EVEN THOUGH YES IT HAS BEEN VETOED -- I WAS WILLING -- TO RECOMMENDING AYE VOTE ON IT SO I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN THAT AND SENATOR JACKSON GO AHEAD. YEAH FOR VERY BRIEFLY -- OF THIS IS A LIMITED SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES ONE POINT TWO OUT OF EVERY -- HUNDRED THOUSAND I JUST WONDER THOUGH IF. IT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO GET THIS INTO CODE BACK IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN OF BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED -- I WONDER IF BY PASSING THIS BILL AND HAVING IT SIGNED INTO LAW THAT MIGHT ALSO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THE IF WE DO NOTHING THEN NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN -- SO IT'S ON THAT BASIS THAT I I WILL MOVE THE BILL AND HOPE THAT WE CAN GET SOME. CLARITY IN SOME CLOSURE ON THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED HERE I THINK THEY'RE LEGITIMATE EVEN IF THEY'RE LIMITED. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO CAUSE ENORMOUS OF PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE PROCESS BUT OF THE PERHAPS IF WEEK PASSES AND IT BECOMES LAW WILL GET THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO CAN CO THIS FAIRLY QUICKLY I SUSPECT SO WITH THAT AND MOVE THE BILL. ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION WE SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR CONCERNS ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY MAY CLOSE. RIGHT SHALL WE DO A ROLL CALL. MEASURES THE PAST TWO TWO DASH. SKINNER FIVE SKINNER I'M MORE LOCKED [inaudible] BRADFORD. JACKSON AYE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MORALE. HIGH. MORALE HIGH WIENER -- WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR OUR MISSING MEMBER. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL NOW GO TO SEE SOME OF THE COLOR IS NOT HERE SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ITEM. ELEVEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON THIS IS AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY TWO GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY TWO INSURERS CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PROMOTE PUBLIC TRUST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY PERMITS AN EMPLOYER TO REQUEST ARREST INFORMATION OF A PEACE OFFICER OR APPLICANT FOR A PEACE OFFICER POSITION. CALIFORNIA LAW ALSO PERMITS CALIFORNIA JUSTICE AGENCIES TO ACCESS THE ARREST RECORDS OF A NON SWORN EMPLOYEE APPLICANT FOR A POSITION WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCY HOWEVER. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT PERMIT CALIFORNIA JUSTICE AGENCIES TO REQUEST ARREST INFORMATION F A NON SWORNEMPLOYEE FOR A NON SWORN EMPLOYEE POSITION. ALLOWING CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES TO ACCESS SUCH INFORMATION ONLY IN CASES WHERE THOSE INDIVIDUALS SPECIFIC DUTIES RELATE TO THE COLLECTION OF ANALYSIS OR OF EVIDENCE OR PROPERTY OR DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE CRIMINAL OFFENDERS OF THEIR RECORDS. IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURING PUBLIC TRUST IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. I WILL HAVE -- WITCHER'S PERMISSION MY WITNESS THE SELF INTRODUCE CERTAINLY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH OR ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION ON SPONSORS OF ASSEMBLY BILL AT THIRTEEN SEVENTY TWO ARE WE WANTING ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR AUTHORING JUST LEGISLATION. ON A WE UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING ETHICAL AND CONSCIENTIOUS PERSONAL IS PIVOTAL TO SAFEGUARD THE INTEGRITY OF OUR COURT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NO MATTER TO RANK OR TITLE -- SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONSISTING TRUSTWORTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY MUST HAVE NECESSARY MEANS TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE ARREST RECORDS -- FOR CERTAIN NON SWORN EMPLOYEES ON THIS PROCESS ENSURES EQUITY TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND FOR THESE REASONS WE HAVE SPONSORED THIS LEGISLATION RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE I AND THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I'M. RIGHT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE SENATOR BRADFORD YES THINK ABOUT YOUR I'M JUST CURIOUS IS YOUR CURRENT PROBLEM RIGHT NOW THAT REQUIRES HIS BILL AND WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE -- THANK YOU I'M YES ARE THERE HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN -- COUNTIES WHERE AT THEIR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NON SWORN FOR EXAMPLE CORRECTIONAL STAFF WHO IS ON MANAGING JAILS AT THE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. AND THEN WHEN THE EMPLOYING AGENCY ASK FOR THAT ARREST RECORD YOUR TOLD THAT UNDER DESPITE YOU KILL LABOR CODE FOR THIRTY SEVEN THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK FOR THAT PERSON'S ARREST RECORDS. BECAUSE THERE WERE PROHIBITED BY LAW -- SO AND THEN -- THERE'S ALSO BEEN AGENCIES WHERE ON THERE HAD BEEN DISPATCHERS WHERE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED ON DO YOU AYE CHARGES I WENT EMPLOYING AT IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY AND WHAT THE EMPLOYING AGENCY. I REQUEST THOUGH DOES ARREST RECORDS THEY'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW I NOTICE LABOR CODE TO ASK FOR HIS ARREST RECORDS SO THEREFORE DEBT -- EMPLOYER IS LEFT OUT WITHOUT ANY THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE SITUATION INVESTIGATED TO SEE WHETHER THOSE CHARGES ACTUALLY OCCURRED IN THE EXAMPLE OF THE CORRECTIONAL STAFF -- THE PERSON WAS ACCUSED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO IS VERY PROBLEMATIC TO HAVE A CORRECTIONAL STAFF WHO'S IN CHARGE OF VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION IN THE JAILS ON TO BE CHARGED WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE YET THE EMPLOYER CAN ACCESS THE RIVER. THE REST WRECKERS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER AT IT HAPPEN OR DID NOT HAPPEN WHAT COURSE OF ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. I GOT IT AND I GUESS MY CONCERN IS [inaudible] JUST. BASED ON A TORN AND DEMONSTRATION THAT WE JUST SAW OUR EARLIER THIS MORNING WHICH IS. RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL OF FORTY FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE. ALREADY COMPLETED HER SENTENCE IN THE FACT THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED -- DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THIS IS A PATTERN OR SHOULD LEAD TO UNEMPLOYMENT ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS SO. I'M JUST REALLY -- CONCERNED HERE AND WHO'S GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY THIS AND YEAH SO I HAVE SOME CONCERNS. WHAT CONCERNS SENATOR MITCHELL HOUSING THEN PERHAPS THE AUTHOR AND WITNESS OF APPROPRIATE CAN RESPOND GO AHEAD SIR? THANK YOU I THINK RIGHT CONCERNS ARE VERY SIMPLE WHAT TROUBLES ME IS IN THE EXAMPLES YOU GAVE YOU TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN CHARGED. AND WE ALL ARE CLEAR THAT AN ARREST. SO WILL BE IN CHARGE AND A CONVICTION ARE THREE DIFFERENT SENT OUT ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SPECTRUM. AND SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO WIN A REST. THAT MAY LEAD TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. MAY LEAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT GIVES ME GREAT CONCERN -- YOU SAID SOMEONE HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH THE NEXT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HE DID NOT SAY WHETHER NOT DID BEEN CONVICTED. BUT A THE REST AND A CHARGE YOU TO SEPARATE STEPS. AND SO IF YOUR BILL TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN CHARGED WITH CERTAIN CRIMES I MIGHT FEEL DIFFERENTLY BUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER -- THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS THAT OCCUR ACROSS THE STATE THAT LEAD TO NO FURTHER ACTION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT'S ALARMING THAT AS WE HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS AROUND THE ISSUE OF BAND BOB BAN THE BOX THAT WE WOULD TAKE A STEP BACKWARDS QUITE FRANKLY. TO OPEN THIS UP -- TO ARREST THAT YOU DON'T EVEN. NEARLY DEFINE ARRESTS FOR WHAT. I COULD BE ARRESTED FOR GAVE ENGAGE IN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MANY OF US HAVE -- WHICH SHOULD HAVE NO BEARING ON MY ABILITY TO TO PERFORM ANY PROFESSIONAL FUNCTION. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I JUST THINK IT'S YOU'VE PAINTED TOO BROAD A BRUSH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND AND YOU CAN ALSO HAVE YOUR WITNESS EXCUSE. I THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT. THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPACT ALL OF THE LABOR CODE THAT'S IN THIS BILL FOR THIRTY SEVEN STANDS AT IT AS IT IS RIGHT NOW WE ARE JUST NARAL LEAD. ON TALKING ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCY AND WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCY WE ARE NARROWLY FOCUSING ON THOSE NON SWORN EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE. VERY PRETTY [inaudible] PARTICULAR POSITIONS WHO HANDLE EVIDENCE AND DO FORENSIC WORK. THAT THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT NOTHING IN THE BILL WOULD AFFECT ANYONE WHO'S TRYING TO APPLY FOR A JOB. OR WHO IS CURRENTLY EMPLOYED IN ANY POSITION. THIS IS A CLARIFICATION IT WOULD AFFECT SOMEONE APPLYING FOR THE JOB IF THEY ARE IN THE CATEGORY THAT YOU'RE NEARLY EXEMPTING CORRECT. CORRECT RIGHT NOW RIGHT ALL RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE POWER TO WELL RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW WHEN WE EMPLOYEE SOMEONE THAT ALREADY EXIST WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS TO ARREST RECORDS. THAT ALREADY IS UNDER CURRENT LAW WE'RE NOT CHANGING THAT. SO IF THEIR SWORN OFFICER BUT NOT THIS CATEGORY YOU KNOW NON SWORN EMPLOYEES AS WELL THAT THAT'S ALSO IN THIS CATEGORY THERE ARE SOME NORRIS NON SWORN EMPLOYEES OR APPLICANTS. YES APPLICANTS FOR NON SWORN EMPLOYEES. UNDER CERTAIN CODE ARE CURRENTLY WE ARE CURRENTLY ABLE TO ACCESS TO ARREST RECORDS IS ONCE THAT THEY'RE HIRED IS THE PROBLEM THEN WE CANNOT GO BACK. I'M NOT THAT WE GO BACK THAT IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DO IT. IS UNDER THIRTY ONE A ONE SENATOR MITCHELL AND SO -- SINCE IT'S BEEN SO NARROWLY DEFINED AS YOU'VE IDENTIFIED -- WHY NOT DIDN'T NEARLY TO FIND THE NATURE OF THE ARREST? WE'RE CERTAINLY WE'RE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT. SIMILAR GRAYSON TO JOIN AT SOMETHING. I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT -- AS WAS ALREADY STATED THAT IT ALREADY EXIST TO BE ABLE TO PULL ARREST RECORDS FOR THOSE THAT ARE APPLY. IT'S ONCE THEY'VE BEEN HIRED FOR NON SWORN EMPLOYEES. AND THOUGH THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO ACTUALLY BUILD A BRIDGE OF TRUST BETWEEN A PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY AND THE COMMUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL. I SEE YOUR REACTION -- BUT TO BE ABLE TO SEE WELL TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT -- IF WE HAVE SOMEONE IN A SENSITIVE -- POSITION THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED -- TO THE ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE OF THE COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE OR PROPERTY OR DIRECTLY RELATED TO SUCH ACTIVITIES AS APPREHENSION PROSECUTION ADJUDICATION INCARCERATION CORRECTION OF CRIMINAL OFFENDERS OR COLLECTION STORAGE DISSEMINATION. OF USAGE OF CRIMINAL OFFENDER RECORD INFORMATION THAT IF SOMEONE IS ARRESTED THAT THAT AGENCY CAN LOOK INTO THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT AFFECTS THEIR EMPLOYMENT. IT JUST SIMPLY MEANS THAT THERE IS AN AWARENESS THAT -- THE AGENCY HAS TAKEN TO BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO IT AND INVESTIGATE -- NO DECISION IS MADE EVERYBODY IS ABSOLUTELY -- WORTHY OF DUE PROCESS AND JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ARREST DOESN'T MEAN THERE MAY BE IT MAY BE A CONVICTION MAY NOT. BUT JUST SO THAT THE AGENCY THAT THEY'RE WORKING FOR BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THEIR POSITION THE AGENCY CAN ALSO BE ABLE TO STATE THAT THEY AS WELL ARE AWARE. AND ARE TAKING MEASURES TO LOOK INTO IT. DARKNESS OF THE NATURE OF THE ARREST. WELL I I THINK THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT -- THE OUR WITNESSES ALSO STATED WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE INTERESTED IN LOOKING INTO -- YOUR CONCERN THERE ABSOLUTELY. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IF THE PERSONS THAT WHOM YOU WOULD BE EXPANDING ITS TO WORK TO BE CONVICTED. THE EMPLOYER WOULD BE NOTIFIED. SO THIS IS SOLELY ON AN ARREST IN OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT WHETHER ARRESTED OR NOT ONE IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY ABSOLUTELY. IT'S IT IS TROUBLING I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT SOME OF THE ASPECTS THAT. GUEST -- EMERGED IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT. IN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF BIAS. FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ALREADY BEEN -- LOTS OF RESEARCH THAT SHOWS IT WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE COURTROOM. IF YOU ARE THE INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW BEING TRIED IF YOU ARE IN STREET CLOTHES. MEANING IF YOU'RE NOT IN SAY AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT. OR LET'S PUT IT THE DIFFERENT WAY IF YOU'RE IN THE ORANGE JUMPSUIT. THE LIKELIHOOD OF YOUR CONVICTION GOES WAY UP I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT PERCENTAGE BUT IT DID SIGNIFICANT -- SO WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN INFORMATION WHETHER -- INTENTIONAL OR NOT AFFECTS OUR PERCEPTION DâN ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S SO THE ARREST MAY HAVE MAY. BE AN YOU KNOW LEAD TO NO CONVICTION IN YET WHAT DOES THE EMPLOYER DO WITH THAT INFORMATION SO I THINK SENATOR MITCHELL'S POINT THAT. IF THE ARREST WERE. WHAT WERE IN RELATING TO AREAS THAT? MAY -- INDICATE THE SOME -- CONCERNS ABOUT THE THE FXE OF THAT PERSON HANDLING FOR EXAMPLE EVIDENCE OR SOMETHING PERHAPS. THAT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. NINE DEAD. LADY THE CATEGORY OF THINGS ONE CAN BE ARRESTED FOR IS QUITE QUITE PROPERTIES RIGHT AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT AND MADAM CHAIR WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT MANDATING THAT AN EMPLOYER -- HAS TO COME TO SOME RESOLUTION THAT IMPACTS A PERSON'S EMPLOYMENT MAKE IT NEGATIVELY. ALL IT SIMPLY DOES IS ALLOW THE EMPLOYER TO HAVE AN AWARENESS BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN IT THAT WOULD PREVENT THE EMPLOYER FROM. IMPACTING THE EMPLOYEE NEGATIVE I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD ALREADY BE -- EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE PROTECTIONS IN EXISTENCE ALREADY -- THIS IS NOT ABOUT TAKING AWAY EMPLOYEE PROTECTIONS THIS IS ABOUT ALLOWING. ESPECIALLY IN THE SENSITIVITY -- IN THE AREA OF SENSITIVITY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRUST WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW JUST MAKING SURE THAT THINGS ARE ABOUT FOUR TRANSPARENT.

AND I'VE SEENFIRST HAND HOW THE THREAT OF GUN VIOLENCE AFFECTS OUR YOUTH IN SCHOOLS. DID YOU KNOW THAT IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE DEATH RATE FROM GUNS SIR PASSED THE DEATH RATE FROM CAR CRASHES IT'S TRUE. AS YOU AND I LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT WAITING FOR OUR YOUNG TEEN DRIVERS TO RETURN HOME. IT'S HARD TO GRASP THIS NEW REALITY. THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM A GUNSHOT. BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT. BUT OUR KIDS GET IT. IT'S PART OF THEIR LIVES NOW. IT'S LIKE BUCKLING ON A SEAT BELT. LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE PARKLAND SHOOTING MY FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND I HAD TO DRIVE PAST THE FLASHING MARQUEE AT THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS. ADVERTISING THE UPCOMING GUN SHOW. SHORTLY THEREAFTER I WATCHED MY DAUGHTER STAND BRAVELY IN FRONT OF THE FAIR BOARD. SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF VERY LOCAL. AND ARE A FOLKS. TO TALK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE. SHE SHARED HOW SHE HAD DRAFTED A STEP BY STEP SKATE PLAN. FROM EACH OF HER HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOMS. SHE TALKED ABOUT SCHOOL FIRE DRILLS. AND HER SCHOOLMATES BEING AFRAID TO LEAVE THE CLASSROOM. FOR FEAR IT WAS A RUSE. FULLER THEM OUT. PRIVATELY SHE SHARED WITH ME THE NAMES OF HER FRIENDS FELLOW CLASSMATES. THE STRONGEST KIDS THE STRONGEST% FOURTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN. WHO HAD BEEN ASSIGNED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BARRICADING THE DOORS WITH SCHOOL FURNITURE? IN CASE OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. THAT'S WHY STOPPING THE GUN SHOWS AND ENDING THE SALE OF GUNS AND AMMUNITION. AT THE FAIR GROUNDS WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF MY CAMPAIGN. BELIEVE ME IT'S A MESSAGE THAT RESONATES STRONGLY. AND IT'S GETTING LOUDER BY THE DAY. WE DON'T WANT OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROLIFERATION OF GUNS. BY SELLING FIRE ARMS ON STATE OWNED PROPERTY. PLEASE GET CALIFORNIA OUT OF THE GUN SHOW BUSINESS AND PASS THIS BILL. WILL GO.

THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE LAWS TO GO WITH THE MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED LAWS A GUN LAWS IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALL THOSE LAWS APPLY. AT GUN SHOWS JUST BECAUSE A GUN SHOW IS HAPPENING DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF STANDARDS THAT TAKES PLACE AND SO. WE HAVE THIS ATTACK ON THIS THIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WERE WERE LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS CAN GATHER AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TO SHARE SIMILAR INTERESTS FOR FOR TRAINING FOR EDUCATION TO FIND OUT WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE OUT THERE SO PEOPLE CAN GATHER ON PUBLICLY ON STATE PROPERTY. TO TO CONDUCT THIS LAWFUL ACTIVITIES STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THAT GUNS PURCHASED FROM GUN SHOWS ARE NOT ANY MORE LIKELY TO BE USED IN CRIMES. AND LET'S RECALL WITH CALIFORNIA'S TEN DAY WAITING PERIOD NO ONE IS GOING TO A GUN SHOW AND PURCHASING A FIREARM AND LEAVING IT WITH IT THAT DAY IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE SO. I THINK THAT THIS THIS MEASURES. JUST NOT GONNA HAVE A PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFIT TO GO ALONG WITH IT. AND IT'S RIGHT NOW AS YOU HEARD IT SUBJECT TO PENDING LITIGATION -- IT'S I BELIEVE THERE'S A MAN A HEARING ON THE MERITS COMING UP NEXT WEEK I THINK THAT WE SHOULD LET THIS TO PLAY OUT.

MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN RECENT YEARS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS ADDRESSED THE REGRESSIVE AND RACIALLY DESPERATE. FINANCIAL HARDSHIP ON YOUTH AND FAMILIES IN THE JUVENILE. JUSTICE SYSTEM BY REDUCING FINES AND FEES BUT PASSED EGISLATION THAT MADE THE SEALING OF JUVENILE RECORDS AUTOMATIC AND FREE ONLY APPLIED TO CERTAIN GROUPS. LEFT OUT WAS A SMALL BOOK VULNERABLE POPULATION MANY OF WHOM CANNOT AFFORD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR FILING FEE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS. A STRANGE STATUTES -- ALLOW JUVENILE RECORDS TO BE SEALED BUT THIS CAN CREATE A CONFLICT FOR BOTH PROSECUTORS AND DEFENSE ATTORNEYS. WITH RESPECT TO OBTAINING INFORMATION NECESSARY TO DISCHARGE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS TO PRODUCE DISCOVERY -- THIS BILL FIFTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WOULD AMEND TO STATUTES THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE IN THE PENAL CODE. TO ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO SEEK ACCESS TO INSPECTOR USE SEAL JUVENILE RECORDS. IN ORDER TO MEET THE STATUTORY CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE TO A DEFENDANT [inaudible] IT WILL. I THINK YOU CUT DOWN ON SOME TRIAL DELAYS AND I HAVE SOME FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH THIS MY WIFE TRY TO JUVENILE CASE LAST YEAR. IN SALES WAS WAS YOUR RECORD AND ONE OF THE ACCUSING WITNESSES HAD SOME. EVIDENCE POTENTIALLY IN A POLICE REPORT OF OF DISHONESTY THAT WAS EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE -- BECAUSE OF THEIR CURRENT. SORT OF LABYRINTH WAY THIS STATUTE SET UP. IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO GET THOSE RECORDS WE END UP HAVING TO CONTINUE THE TRIAL. WITH ULTIMATELY GOT DONE AND THEY WERE USED IN THE TRIAL BUT I THINK. IT'S A GOOD CHANGE IN LAW THAT WILL HELP PROSECUTORS DISCHARGE THEIR DUTIES MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT. OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR BRADY OBLIGATIONS THAT IT WILL HELP DEFENSE ATTORNEYS -- OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO OBTAIN OR TO PROPERLY DEFEND THEIR CLIENTS. THE BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION IT PASSED THE ASSEMBLY UNANIMOUSLY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND TIFFANY MATTHEWS WITH A CDA IS HERE AS WELL TO PRESENT. GOOD MORNING FIFTY MATHIS ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE SPELL. THIS WILL EXPAND THE PROSECUTORS ABILITY TO ACCESS A SEALED JUVENILE RECORD FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH OUR DISCOVERY OBLIGATION. THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE PROSECUTOR HAS A WITNESS. AND WE ARE AWARE THAT THE WITNESS HAS A JUVENILE RECORD BUT IT FIELD. THIS INFORMATION MAY PROVIDE EXCULPATORY OR FAVORABLE EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENDANT AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE CATER TO PROVIDE IT. AND JUST BECAUSE WE PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT WILL BE ADMISSIBLE. THE JUDGE STILL HAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROBATIVE VALUE IS SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHED BY THE DANGERS OF UNDUE PREJUDICE. THIS BILL BOUNCES THE PROTECTION OF JUVENILE RECORDS IN THE PROSECUTOR'S DUTY TO ENSURE THAT THE DEFENDANT GETS A FAIR TRIAL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE. ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LA DA HAS REQUESTED THAT I GIVE ME TWO ON THEIR BEHALF. OKAY. RATING KNOWN AS THEIR COMMANDER -- DISCUSSION BY QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUES [inaudible] RIGHT TIME.

THANKFUL THAT THE FIRE SEEMS TO BE CONTAINED [inaudible] YEAH. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS LIVE IN OR DO STE AJ ARE FOR TO URGE CONGRESS TO SWITCH WITH HOUSE. HOUSE RESOLUTION EIGHT THE BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS LAW HELPS REDUCE THE TRAGEDIES OF GUN VIOLENCE BY KEEPING FARMER FIRE ARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE ALREADY PASSED LAWS TO REQUIRE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WITHOUT ANY LOOPHOLES. HOWEVER UNTIL WE BRING THIS EFFECTIVE FOREIGN POLICY TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY A DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE IN FEDERAL GUN LAW WILL STILL EXEMPTS UNLICENSED SELLERS FROM HAVING TO PERFORM ANY BACKGROUND CHECKS. WHAT SO EVER BEFORE SELLING A FIREARM? THIS GAP IN FEDERAL LAW LEAVES PEOPLE EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA SUBJECT TO THE DANGERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK. OBTAINING FIREARMS FROM UNLICENSED SELLERS OUT OF STATE. BY PASSING AG ARE FOR OUR CALIFORNIA LEADERS IN CONGRESS AND OUR PRESIDENT WILL RECEIVE THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR THE CALIFORNIA FORMALLY AND PUBLICLY DEMANDS. THE SPEEDY PASSAGE IN SIGNING OF HRT. I ASKED FOR A VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF YOU HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOU CAN JUST GO UP TO THE STANDING MICHAELIS REVELING TESTIMONY GO AHEAD. REBECCA GONZALEZ VOLUNTEER WITH BRADY IN STRONG SUPPORT. CALVIN QUICK BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVIST STRONG SUPPORT. KATHY BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. GREAT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD DâN RE WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE FOR CALIFORNIA RIFLE. AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION AS WELL WERE IN OPPOSITION -- TO AG ARE. FOR JUST LAST OCTOBER IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE VIOLENCE PREVENTION RESEARCH PROGRAM A UC DAVIS AND THE CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH AT JOHN HOPKINS. ACTUALLY PUBLISH THEIR FINDING ON STUDYING CALIFORNIA'S EXPANDED BACKGROUND CHECKS AND LOOKING AT OUR ROUGHLY TWENTY YEAR HISTORY OF EXPANDED BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THEY FOUND THAT -- THESE EXPANDED CHECKS AS WELL AS THE EXTENSION OF CERTAIN MISDEMEANOR CRIMES HAD NO IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S HOMICIDE RATE. SO WE HAVE A TWENTY YEAR EXPERIENCE. THURMOND HERE THAT THAT IT'S JUST NOT. PROVIDING WHAT WHAT WAS -- WHAT WAS INTENDED AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING A LAWFUL ACTIVITY IN YOUR PUTTING A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS ON VERY COMMON TRANSFERS? BECAUSE EXPAND BACKGROUND CHECKS DON'T JUST COVER SALES OF FIREARMS IT'S ANYTIME YOU'RE RELINQUISHING POSSESSION. YOU'RE NEEDING TO GO DOWN TO A GUN SHOW ARE A GUN STORE IN PERFORMANCE CHECK PAY A FEE -- IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THAT'S TWO TRIPS SO IF YOU WANNA LOAN YOUR FIREARM TO SOMEONE -- FOR UNSPECIFIED PURPOSE IN CALIFORNIA THE ONLY THING THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOAN YOUR FIREARM FOR IS TO A LICENSE HUNTER -- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS PAY A FEE -- EXCEPT -- UNLESS IT'S IN YOUR PRESENCE AND WHAT HAPPENS WITH A LOT OF THESE LAWS WE'VE SEEN A MOVEMENT -- TO TRY AND AND CAPTURE THESE UNLICENSED TRANSFERS -- IS YOU'RE REALLY NOT CAPTURING CRIMINALS CRIMINALS ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THE LAWFUL MEANS AND THERE'S ALREADY LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT PROHIBIT. PRETTY PERSONS FROM FROM ACQUIRING FIREARMS IT'S A FELONY AND GENERALLY A AN INFRACTION -- ON THE THE BACKGROUND CHECK IS A MISDEMEANOR IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT ONE AT THAT TO PROVE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A STATURE LIMITATIONS IN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PROVE WHERE THE GUN FROM CAME FROM. WHEN IT GOT ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED IF IT FELL WITHIN THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS AND WE KNOW THAT -- VIOLATIONS BACKGROUND CHECKS AREN'T AREN'T ALWAYS. PROSECUTED RIGHT SO WE NEED TO START ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS ON THE BOOKS ACTUALLY A PARTIAL PENALTIES FOR PROHIBITED PERSONS AND NOT -- TIE UP LAW ABIDING PEOPLE -- WITH WITH THE ADDITIONAL RED TAPE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO MAYBE EVEN HAS A CCW THAT YOU'RE GONNA LOAN A GUN. I'M SO THEY COULD TRY IT OUT OR MAYBE FOR SELF PROTECTION OR MAYBE YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE -- CRISIS IN THE HOME AND YOU NEED TO GET THAT FARM OUT TO A NEIGHBOR AND YOU COULD BE RUNNING AFOUL TO CERTAIN LAW SO. WITH THAT IN MANY OTHER REASONS WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR MADAM CHAIR OKAY. AT THE I AGO EVERYTHING THAT MY MY MY COLLEAGUES SAID AND INSTEAD OF GOING INTO A LOT OF MORE MORE DIALOGUE IS TO THE THE SPECIFICS OF THE RESOLUTION I I WOULD LIKE. TO READ TO YOU WHAT WOULD JESSE UNRUH SAID ABOUT ABOUT RESOLUTIONS F IF THAT WOULD BE OKAY -- AS PART OF MY TESTIMONY -- JESSE UNDER SAYS I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE RESOLUTIONS WHEN THEY GET TO WASHINGTON DC THEY COME IN THE MAIL TO THE CONGRESSMEN OR SENATORS OFFICE AND THEY GO STRAIGHT INTO THE ROUND FILE. THIS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO POINT IN DOING THEM EXCEPT TO CAUSE CONTROVERSY IMPROVE PROVOKED DEBATES ON THE FLOOR THAT TAKE UP A LOT OF OUR TIME. THEY ARE USELESS THAT WAS WITH JESSE UNRUH SAID AND AND THAT THAT'S KIND OF OUR POSITION ON ON THE RESOLUTIONS IF WE WANT TO TALK POLICY LET'S TALK POLICY WE DO IT ALL THE TIME. WE WE COME FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES BUT A RESOLUTION IN THIS CASE IS A IS A IS A LOT OF A MOTION THAT. DOES NOTHING AND AND THEN I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF US HAVE THE TIME TO TO SPEND ON ON DOING THAT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN OPPOSITION AND I QUOTE. THE ILLUSTRIOUS FORMER SPEAKER JESSE UNDER. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION IS THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF DISCUSSIONS ON ARE GONE BILLS TODAY AND WE FED -- SIMILAR OPPOSITION AND SIMILAR SUPPORT -- BUT CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF IN OVER YEARS WITH DIDN'T ACT MEANT OF OUR AREA STRONG. GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION LAWS WE HAVE REDUCED GUN VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA AS COMPARED TO OTHER STATES THAT HAVE NOT ENACTED SUCH LAWS. SO. WITH THAT. YOU MAY CLOSE -- ELEVEN STATES ALREADY HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECKS AND I THINK THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF HR EIGHT THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES WILL BE PROTECTED. BY A UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENT FOR GUN PURCHASES WHETHER FROM A LICENSE UNLICENSED DEALER. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I ASKED FOR AYE VOTE. RIGHT WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE FLOOR CORRECT. SO IT'S JUST BE ADOPTED OKAY -- I AM THE MOTION IS BE ADOPTED IDEN FIFTEEN NON FAMILIAR ONE TO ME BUT THAT'S OKAY. ANYWAY WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL. SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. MORE LIKE NO BRADFORD. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MORALE [inaudible] WIENER.

MADAM A SEED WITH YOUR ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN HA ARE. FIVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS AG ARE FIVE URGES TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO USE CALIFORNIA AS A MODEL FOR REASONABLE FIREARM SAFETY AS WE WORK TO PASS NATIONAL FIREARMS SAFETY REGULATION. IN COMPARISON THE REST OF THE NATION CALIFORNIA RANKED THIRD IN GUN HOMICIDES AND SIXTEEN AND GUN DEATHS AND THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES BUT BY TWENTY SIXTEEN IMPROVED TO TWENTY FIFTH IN GUN HOMICIDES PER CAPITA. WITH THE EIGHTH LOWEST RATE OF GUN RELATED DEATHS NATIONWIDE. THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA PASSED LEGISLATION AIMED AT CLOSING ANY LOOPHOLES OR CONFUSION ON FIREARM SAFETY AND OWNERSHIP WITHIN THIS STATE. AS MENTIONED IN AGE ARE IF SOMEONE IS CONVICTED OF A HATE CRIME IN CALIFORNIA THAT PERSON IS PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASING AND POSSESSING FIREARMS. CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST STATE TO ENACT A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER KNOWN AS AN EXTREME RISK PROTECTION ORDER IN MOST STATES. IN CALIFORNIA PERSONS PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASING MULTIPLE GO HAND GUNS IN A SINGLE SALE. CALIFORNIA JURORS FIREARM USERS ARE PROTECTED FROM SPEND SAY FIREARMS BY PER PER PROHIBITING THE MANUFACTURING IMPORTATION I'M SAFE GUNS INTO THE STATE. IS IMPORTANT NOTE THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE WORKING TOWARDS ENDING GUN VIOLENCE IN THE STATE WE HAVE MADE A PRIORITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ROOT. CAUSE BY CREATING A FIRE ARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER AT UC DAVIS CALIFORNIA'S PROVEN. STRONGER FIREARM SAFETY LAWS CAN LEAD TO REDUCE RATES OF GUN VIOLENCE WHICH INSURES PUBLIC SAFETY. WHILE SOME MIGHT ARGUE THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT NEEDED LET ME POINT THEM TO AN FBI STATED IT FOUND 75% OF FIREARMS USED IN A MASS SHOOTING WERE PURCHASED LEGALLY. AJ ARE FIVE IS NEEDED TO LET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT KNOW THAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLC THAT THIS NATION ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE BY CREATING UNIVERSAL FIREARM STANDARD SAFETY STANDARDS THAT ARE STRONG AND SENSIBLE. CONTINUE TO SUBJECT OUR COMMUNITY TO THE PAIN AND SUFFERING CAUSED BY GUN VIOLENCE DOES NOT MAKE SENSE WHEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE HAVE A WHEN WE HAVE A PROVEN WAY. OF REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE GUN VIOLENCE IS A DISEASE THAT IS DESTROYING LIFE IN THIS TIME WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THIS DISEASE HERE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AS AMANDA WILCOX FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF BRADY UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR GEICO. HI YOU KNOW OUR NEW NAME BETTER THAN ME. DOESN'T ROLL OFF MY TONGUE AT YES AMANDA WILCOX WITH OPERATING CALIFORNIA HAS THAT. SOMEWHERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION OBVIOUSLY. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE STOCKTON SCHOOLYARD SHOOTING HAPPENED A CLEVELAND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A NUMBER OF I THINK THEY WERE SECOND GRADERS MAINLY WERE KILLED. A TEACHER WAS INJURED AND IT SHOOK THAT COMMUNITY AS WELL AS OUR STATE. AND ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS AFTER THAT. CALIFORNIA'S STARTED TO ENACT SOME OF THE STRONGEST GUN LAWS INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK. THAN TEN DAY WAITING PERIOD THE FIRST AND I IN OUR NATION'S ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. AND MANY OTHERS OF WE'VE CONTINUED TO ENACT LAWS I STARTED WORKING AS AN ADVOCATE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO MANY LAWS HAVE BEEN. PASSED UNDER MY WATCH -- IN DURING THAT TIME SINCE THE HIGH NINETEEN NINETY THREE AS YOU'VE HEARD OUR GUN DEATH RATE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY -- ALMOST FOUR TIMES THE DROP IN THE REST OF THE NATION AND I'D LIKE TO ADD BECAUSE I KNOW THE OPPOSITION WILL SAY IT'S ABOUT BEING TOUGH ON CRIME AND THREE STRIKES. THAT OVER HALF OUR GUN DEATHS ARE BY SUICIDE. AND TO REDUCE FARM VIOLENCE ONE NEEDS TO REDUCE. SUICIDE BY FIREARM AND WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DROP THERE AS WELL AND THAT'S NOT A CRIMINAL ISSUE -- IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING THAT WE SEE THESE THAT ARE LOST HIM THAT KIND OF AFFECTING CALIFORNIA AND WE SEE NOTHING HAPPENING NATIONALLY -- LAWS THAT ARE CURRENTLY -- BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN -- WASHINGTON ARE ALL LWS THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS -- EXTREMIST ORDERS IS CALLED NATIONALLY OR DVR -- LAWS PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO THE STATE THERE'S A BILL -- TO FONG G MBINES PREVENTION RESEARCH ALL THINGS THAT WE DO IN CALIFORNIA IT IS SO FRUSTRATING THAT THESE LAWS DO NOT MOVE EVEN THOUGH PUBLIC OPINION SHOWS VERY STRONG SUPPORT FOR THESE MEASURES -- BUT CALIFORNIA IS TAKING THE LEAD ON MANY ISSUES THE ACTUALLY THE NATION HAS OFTEN FOLLOWED. AND I HOPE THEY WILL ON THIS AND I APPLAUD CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE FOR MAKING A STATEMENT THAT -- THE REST OF THE NATION TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE TO PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE CHAIRS -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP I'VE WORKED WITH BOTH OF YOU FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- BY PEERS AND OTHER STATES ARE VERY ENVIOUS OF WHAT WE CAN DO IN CALIFORNIA AND THE LEGISLATORS THAT I GET TO WORK WITH. THANK YOU ALL. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING DANIELLE CANDOR BECAUSE OUR BEHALF OF THE GIFFORDS LAWCENTER IN SUPPORT. RIGHT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] HI [inaudible] GO AHEAD. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR THE RECORD AND RE WITH NATIONAL RIGHT TO ASSOCIATION ALSO YOUR FIRST YEAR I BROUGHT A VISUAL AIDTHIS IS THE CALIFORNIA GUN LAWS BOOK IT'S PUT TOGETHER BY -- OUR ATTORNEYS AND IT'S MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED PAGES -- IT COVERS. MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED STATE LAWS STATE TRANSCEND ALL VARIOUS CODE SECTIONS BEING A GUN OWNER CALIFORNIA'S VERY DIFFICULT THERE'S A LOT TO KNOW. THE LAWS ARE VERY CONFUSING AND THEIR EVER CHANGING EACH YEAR WE DEAL WITH DOZENS UPON DOZENS OF PROPOSALS -- SOME IN ACTED SUMMER NOT -- AND THIS BOOK IS HAS BEEN UPDATED ANNUALLY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND WE HAVE [inaudible] JUST. THERE'S JUST A LOT TO REMEMBER AS A GUN OWNER AND YOU COULD. CONSTANTLY AT RISK OF OF OF LOSING YOUR RIGHTS BECAUSE OF AN INFRACTION TO ONE OF THESE LAWS -- WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL BILLS INCLUDING A TRANSPORTATION BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT COULD RESULT IN A FIVE YEAR PROBATION -- WITH WITH SOME OF THE LAWS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE INTENTION BEHIND AMMAR THEIR THEIR WELL INTENDED AND THEY'VE -- FOCUS MORE ON THE INSTRUMENT RATHER THAN THE BAD ACTORS AND AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S MISGUIDED WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE ABUSING OUR LAWS -- WE HAVE A HUGE BACKLOG ON THE APP SYSTEM WE'VE THROWN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THAT WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE PROHIBITED. THOSE WHO ARE OUT THERE MISS USING FIREARMS -- ONE THING I WANTED TO TOUCH ON LAST WEEK THERE WAS A DISCUSSION THIS COMMITTEE -- ON ACTUALLY -- A BILL -- ON DAY SEEKING AND ROSTER AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THERE'S SEVERAL TIMES WE SEEN EXEMPTIONS THEY'RE TRYING TO EXEMPTS CERTAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM HAVING TO USE ROSTERED AND GUNS AND I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ON ON THAT BILL -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NOT HAD A NEW MODEL SEMIAUTOMATIC FIREARM ADDEDTO THE THE SAFE HANDGUN ROSTER SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BECAUSE THE STANDARDS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET. AND AND THAT JUST GOES ALONG WITH THE LAWSUIT SO GUN OWNERS ARE ARE NOT. OF A THIRD THERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE JUST BEING BANNED BECAUSE OF OUR LAWS THAT ARE WELL MADE WHILE THE UNDERLYING LONG MAY BE WELL INTENTIONED -- TO TO GO AFTER CERTAIN GUNS WERE WERE NOT ABLE TO PURCHASE THE LATEST AND MOST RELIABLE AND SAFEMODELS. AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFIT TO THAT WHEN WERE EXEMPTING LAW ENFORCEMENT -- BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THOSE MODELS AS WELL AND SO -- I'M HAPPY TO TO DISCUSS THAT BILL AT ANOTHER TIME I KNOW THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR NOW -- BUT BUT THE LAWS ARE ARDUOUS ON ONE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE CRIMINAL MISUSE. I MEAN THERE'S PLENTY LAWS ON THE BOOKS TO DO THAT THANK YOU. BEFORE NEXT WITNESS JUST AS A POINT OF CORRECTION THE APPS BACKLOG IS GREATLY REDUCED ON PLEASE PROCEED.
