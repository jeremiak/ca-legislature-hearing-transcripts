DR PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANKS ON EASY TWENTY THREE FIFTEEN TODAY. WITH REQUIRES CONDITIONS REQUIRE. YOU CAN OVER A NUMBER OF. THANK REAL FACILITIES TO BE FILLED BY CIVIL SERVANTS SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN VACANCY RATES FOR STAFF PSYCHIATRIST AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION FACILITIES AND STATE HOSPITALS HAS BEEN ABOVE FORTY PERCENT. WELL FEWER SUPERVISORY POSITIONS ARE AVAILABLE THERE ARE SIMILAR VACANCY ISSUES THIS IS DESPITE HAVING FULL TIME CIVIL SERVANTS AT THESE HOSPITALS APPLYING FOR SUCH SUPERVISORY DUTIES. INSTEAD OF HIRING WITHIN SOME FACILITIES HAVE TURNED EXTERNALLY TO CONTRACT OUT TO FILL THESE POSITIONS TEMPORARILY. FOR THE FACILITY PSYCHIATRIST THEIR PATIENTS AND THE STATE CONTRACTING OUT SUPERVISORY POSITIONS CAN CAUSE INSTITUTIONAL TURMOIL INTERRUPT THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE AND INCREASED COST TO THE STATE. AS AN EXAMPLE OF THOSE COST INCREASES YOU APD IS FOUND THAT FOR STAFF PSYCHIATRIST ALONE CONTRACTORS ARE PAID ROUGHLY TWICE AS MUCH AS THEIR CIVIL SERVANT COUNTERPARTS. AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE WITNESSES CIVIL SERVANTS ARE READY AND WILLING TO FILL VACANCIES. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FILLED BY. AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY WILL ENSURE CONTINUED GROWTHOF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE STAFF COHESION AND CONTINUITY INPATIENT SERVICES IN OUR STATE HOSPITALS AND CD R. FACILITIES I AM JOINED TODAY BY DOUG CHIP PETA IN PERSON AND SPENCER DAVIDSON ON THE PHONES FROM THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS. THANK YOU DR RANIA- DECK CHIPATA- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS ALSO THE- CHAIR OF THE ASKED ME CALIFORNIA STEERING COMMITTEE- I WANTED TO I THINK OBVIOUSLY DR RAMBLE FOR INTRODUCING THIS- NEEDED A PIECE OF LEGISLATION- IT IN A RELATED- PIECE OF LEGISLATION MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING ASSEMBLY BILL. SIX FIFTY SEVEN- WHAT THE OBJECTIVE IS TO REIN IN- CONTRACTING OUT OF THIS IS A VERY- SIMPLE BILL EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THERE'S A LONG STANDING PROBLEM OF CONTRACTING OUT WITH RESPECT TO CIVIL SRVICE JOBS. WITH THE- I THINK DONE A THOROUGH JOB OF EDUCATING- AND WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF- MR BOLTON'S VERY COMPETENT IN THIS AREA- SO THERE'S NO NEED TO REHASH THAT THIS IS A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD PROBLEM. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT- VACANCY RATE- WOULD FOR PSYCHIATRY AND DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS AND ALSO DEPARTMENTS THEY HOSPITAL'S APPROACHING THIS BILL. IS THAT. A CONTRACTOR CANNOT FILL A SUPERVISORY POSITION BUT IN THIS CASE VERY SPECIFICALLY. WHAT YOU HAVE OR CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN FILLING THE ROLE OF MEDICAL DIRECTOR WHO OVERSEES STATE PSYCHIATRISTS AT STATE. OF HOSPITALS AROUND OF THE STATE WE HAVE FIVE OF THEM ONE IS COALINGA IN IN- DR ROMULUS DISTRICT WILL SERVE METROPOLITAN STATE HOSPITAL. PENN STATE HOSPITAL IN THE LA AREA WE HAVE- NAPA STATE HOSPITAL IN SENATOR DODDS- AREA AND THEN OBVIOUSLY A TUSKER THEY'LL STATE HOSPITAL- I BELIEVE OUR SECOND WITNESS WILL SPEAK TO THAT- SO WE HAD. AS AN EXAM SUB FORCE OR FIVE CIVIL SERVANTS PSYCHIATRIST DULY QUALIFIED TO APPLY FOR THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR THERE AND IT'S A POSITION OF PRESTIGE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY INSTILL- YOU KNOW COULD YOU COULD YOU CAN SURELY ALITY BUT ALSO- IT'S A CLINICAL AMONG SOCIETY PSYCHIATRIST YOUR- YEAH- IT'S A- A BADGE OF HONOR IF YOU ON THE FIELD OF MEDICINE. TO BE A MEDICAL DIRECTOR MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE NOW BEING FILLED BY CONTRACTORS AT THE TUSKER THEY'LL STATE HOSPITAL WE HAD FOUR FIVE CIVIL SERVICE A PSYCHIATRIST. A PLAN FOR THIS JOB THEY'RE ALL TURNED AWAY AND THEY PLAY A PART OF THE APPROVED A MEDICAL DIRECTOR WHO'S A CONTRACTOR. FOR IN ACTING CAPACITY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. AFTER HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS THEY RE UP HIM FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS- IN DOING OUR RESEARCH WE FIND THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT IS RAMPING UP OTHER STATE HOSPITALS AND ALSO WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. SO THIS BILL BY DR ROBBIE THAT WILL ALLEVIATE THAT PROBLEM MAKE SURE THAT- WHEN SOMEONE ASCENDS TO THE POSITION OF MEDICAL DIRECTOR WHICH IS A SUPERVISORY POSITION- THEY WOULD PUT IN THEIR TIME. AS A CIVIL SERVANT AND HAVE PATIENT CARE AT THE FOREFRONT- I THINK DOCTOR OPULENT AND THAT WE URGE YOUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE STUDY LEGISLATION. AND NOW IT WILL I THINK WE'LL HAVE A SECOND WITNESS THANK YOU. OPERATE I THINK THANK YOU EVERYONE. IN THE WELL HI I THINK EVERYONE THE DAY WITH RAPID FOR THE UNION OF A PHYSICIANS AND THEN. DURING THE CALL OF MY DUTIES AS A THANK POSITION MEMBERS TO MY- THAT A CONTRACTOR BY PIRATES SAID TAP HERE THE POP. BUT PLATE INTO A TIE CAL OF MEDICAL. THEY HAVE MANY CONCERNS NAMELY THE FACT A NON CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE SUPER CAP PASSED THE OVER CIVIL. A THERE WERE FOR HI THEN PHYSICIAN THAT WOULD BEEN AND IN THAT POSITION. WHILE THE STATE THIRDS A PERMANENT MEDICAL. IN FACT PRIOR TO PLACING THE CONTRACTOR IN THAT POSITION ATOP HERE AT THE HOSPITAL DID PLACE THE HOLD SERVICE VOLUNTEER THAN THE POSITION IN AN ACTING CAPACITY BY THE FORMER STATE EMPLOYEE I WAS APPALLED THAT THE STATE WOULD ALLOW CONTRACTORS TO SUPERVISE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES. CONTRACTORS WHO ARE AT WILL EMPLOYEES HAVE NO LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO THE STATE AND DO NOT HAVE AS MUCH EXPERIENCE AS SOMETHING EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN AT THE HOSPITAL MANY YEARS THE PRACTICE OF PLACING A CONTRACTOR IN A MANAGERIAL OR SUPERVISORY CAPACITY IS APPALLING BECAUSE IT DISCOURAGES UPWARD MOBILITY IN ADDITION YOU HAVE A CONTRACTOR OVERSEEING THE LOOK SERVICE EMPLOYEES. MAKING DECISIONS ON WHO TO HIRE OR FIRE CONDUCTING PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PROVIDING TRAINING PROVIDING DISCIPLINE EXCEPT FOR A WHILE THE THEMSELVES ARE FULLY OF AN AGENCY CONTRACTED THROUGH THE STATE AND NOT STATE EMPLOYEE. OF THE BILL OF IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE IT CHAU CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES THE STATE VALUES THEIR SERVICE AND WILL ENSURE. THAT THEY WERE. ONE FOUR. POINT EIGHT AND ALSO PER UP MOBILITY WITH THE STATE.

IN THIS ROOM WITH A FILE ITEM WAS USED TO PATTERSON AUDIENCE. FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B. SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE. YUP. MISTER PATTERSON MEMBERS OF THE BILL WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. THANK MISTER MEMBERS UP. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE IS A BILL TO SIMPLY EXTEND WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS TO THOSE YOU CONFIDE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER TO AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OR A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. MY OFFICE HAS PERSONALLY RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM STATE WORKERS AT VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. INFORMING ME OF ISSUES AN ACTIVITY THAT THEY CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE HOWEVER THEY OFTEN FEAR FOR THEIR JOBS AND WITHHOLD ANY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY DO NOT RECEIVE ANY WHISTLE BLOWER PROTECTIONS WHEN CONFIDING. IN THE LEGISLATURE. CURRENTLY SECTION EIGHT FIVE FOUR SEVEN OF THE GOVERNMENT COAT PROTECT STATE WORKERS FROM RETALIATION WHEN THEY REPORT ILLEGAL OR IMPROPER CONDUCT TO THE STATE AUDITOR OR THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. THIS INCLUDES REPORTING UP WASTE AND FRAUD ABUSE OF AUTHORITY VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW OR THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH WITHOUT FEAR. OF RETRIBUTION. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE WILL EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM PROTECTED DISCLOSURE TO INCLUDE INCLUDE A COMPLAINT MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE OR A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE. ALLOWING STATE WORKERS TO CONFIDE IN THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION. CURRENTLY NONE OF THE QUESTEL BLOWER PROTECTIONS OUTLAWED IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE OR LABOR CODE SPECIFIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE OULD CONSTITUTE A PROTECTED DISCLOSURE. THIS BILL IMPORTANTLY DOES NOT GIVE THE LEGISLATURE ANY INVESTIGATIVE OR ANY ADDITIONAL POWERS BUT SIMPLY THAT AN EMPLOYEE WOULD BE PROTECTED FROM RETALIATION BY THEIR EMPLOYER. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE A- AS A WITNESS AT THE STATE THE EMPLOYEE COLIN GRANT HE IS ON THE PHONE FOR HIS TESTIMONY. THE THREAT. MISTER AT WHAT. IF I AM HERE PLEASE PROCEED. WELL I'VE BEEN A STATE EMPLOYEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS NOW AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I'LL FOLLOW THE WHISTLE BLOWER COMPLAINT WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO REPORT. WASTE GROSS MISCONDUCT IN PENN- AND- IN ADDITION THE A BY. GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT AT THE TIME THE WHISTLE BLOWER COMPLAINT TO THE STATE OFFICE- STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE BUT NOT ENOUGH- MY OVERWHELMINGLY FELT THAT I NEEDED TO CONTACT THE LEGISLATURE AND I DID. AND I ENDED UP TESTIFYING IN A JOINT COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT- AUDIT OF THE DEPARTMENT WHICH WAS DO WOULD BE TO- THE WHOLE PROCESS I WAS COMPLETELY SURPRISED BECAUSE I HAD NO WHISTLE BLOWER PROTECTIONS UNDER LAW BY REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE- BUT I DID ANYWAY BECAUSE I HAD TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE AS A MANAGER YOU KNOW SEEING MY EMPLOYEE CRYING BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL AT WORK AT NINE O'CLOCK AND THEY HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD AT HOME WITH A BEARABLE FOR ME. SO IN THAT CASE WHEN YOU AND I JUST WENT ON AHEAD BECAUSE I FELT THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND INVOLVEMENT WITH NEEDED IN THAT CASE AND WILL SUPPORT. WHAT ARE- YOU KNOW THEY DON'T FEAR INTIMIDATION COURTS AND- RIGHT THE RETALIATION BUT THAT ONLY APPLIES WHEN THEY REPORT THINGS TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND- ON DIFFERENT SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE LIKE I SAID IT WOULD EXTEND THE- THE PROTECTION TO WHEN WE REPORTED THAT LEAD PLAINTIFF WHICH I BELIEVE IS VERY NECESSARY BECAUSE LIKE EVEN IN THE CASE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF IT IF IT WAS PASSED WHERE. THE STATE AUDITOR WOULD JUST BE ABLE TO AUDIT THEM AND FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT MORE IMMEDIATE ACTION WAS NEEDED BUT LIKE I SAID I WAS MOTIVATED TO THE PUBLIC AT THE THINGS DISCUSSED. VERY UNBEARABLE. THANK YOU. THIS WITNESSES SUPPORT THE ROOM ANYWAY THIS IS A- SIGNAL WITNESSES ON THE PHONE OPERATOR. ANY WITNESSES IN A PHONE OPPOSITION OF AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. NO ONE ON THE FRONT LINES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE. WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT SUPPORT OPERATOR BUT- SORRY ANY PARTICIPANT IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SEVEN TO THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND THERE IS NO ONE ON THE PHONE LINES IN SUPPORT FOR THE CONTINUED THANK YOU FOR YOUR BILL- FOLKS IN OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT ON THE PHONE LINES THIS WOULD OPPOSITION THE ROOM ANYBODY OPPOSITION IS BILL THE ROOM. BRING BACK THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE'RE STILL SUBCOMMITTEE SO- IT WILL BE A QUESTION OKAY THAT'S ONE QUESTION I'VE DUBBED AND BEEN MADE AWARE OF AN ISSUE WHEREIN- THIS BILL COULD MAKE- LAWMAKERS COM IF ANY OF ANY OF ANY PERSON'S NAME. SOMEHOW GETS DISCLOSED YOU HAVEN'T GIVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. I DO THIS WELL CAME THROUGH A JUDICIARY ON CONSENT AND THERE WAS NOTHING RAISED OF THAT CONCERN OKAY. WELL IT BUT DOES IT DOES IT DO THAT THOUGH DOES IT MAKE YOU INTO THE LAB AT THE THAT. ALL RIGHT BUT WE DID THAT BETTER YET MAYBE MAYBE THE BETTER WAYS JUST CONTEMPLATE THAT. I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE A SOLUTION TODAY I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS A REAL PROBLEM. JUST KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT. THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT TO OCCUR AND HELP WAS THE BILL MOST OF THE PROCESS THAT CAN BE FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THAT. WELL I'M AT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THAT RAISED RIGHT I'M TELLING YOU IT'S A CONCERN. SO I AM MAKING AWARE OF IT SO YOU DO NOT HAVE IT. THIS THE FIRST TIME IS THE FIRST TIME BUT JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT IT'S A CONCERN THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MANDATE IS A THINK A LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE NEED TO STOP THE BAYLOR SPORTS VILLARD BUT AGAINST THE VILLAINOUS TELL YOU THAT THAT MAY BE A PROBLEM GOING FORWARD TO HELP AS IT MOVES TO THE PROCESS. THAT WILL THIS BE CONTEMPLATED. WHAT WILL WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND- FIND OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT. WHERE THE CONCERN RESTS WIDE UP TO. I THINK THERE THE BEST I CAN SAY IS THAT THE PEERS TO BE AN IMPLICATION OF THE BILL NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BEST SPECIFIED IN IT OR IN SOME WAY- RISKS A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE IT IT IS THE- TO ME IT'S THE SAME KIND OF WHISTLE BLOWER PROTECTION- THAT THAT ARE IT'S GIVEN TO OTHERS. HAVE WITH THESE OTHER AGENCIES OR ORGANIZATIONS. AND IN ORDER I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S IT'S AN UNDERCURRENT OF CONCERN ABOUT THE LIABILITY TO THOSE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S AN IMPLICATION AND MAYBE THAT'S- WELL IT IS. OKAY MISTER PATTERSON WITH AT CLOSING YOUR BILL. YEAH I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT CRUCIAL THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THERE ARE STATE WORKERS ARE ABLE TO CONFIDE IN THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS. ABOUT IMPROPER GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION A. B. ONE SEVEN TWO THREE WOULD GIVE STATE EMPLOYEES ANOTHER AVENUE TO REPORT SUCH IMPROPER ACTIVITIES WHILE ENSURING THEIR JOBS ARE NOT THREATENED AND AS I LOOKED AT THIS THOROUGHLY AND- FOUND NO ISSUES WITH THAT AND IT THAT. WENT TO CONSENT AND ALSO THIS IS A MARROW BILL. I DON'T THINK WE WANT OUR LEGIS LATERS TO PREP. AT ESSENTIALLY DO AUDITS ERA IT IS INFORMATION ATTRACTED AND THEN LEGISLATORS HAVE THE CHOICE OF CONSIDERING LEGISLATION OR MAY BE ASKING FOR AN OFFICIAL AUDIT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT. WE HAVE RECEIVED STATE WORKERS WHO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE AND THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDED IN US- THE DMV IS ONE OF THEM THE EDT IS ANOTHER AND ALSO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL THERE ARE PEOPLE GOOD PEOPLE INSIDE THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY WANT TO BE HEARD BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO BE PROTECTEDAND I THINK HAVING THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE THE LEGISLATURE. A BE ABLE TO GRANT THAT- I THINK THE IMPLICATION OF LIABILITY IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT BUT- I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK IT'S IMPLIED IN THE BILL AT ALL. AND I. RESPECT AN AYE VOTE WHEN OF THE FULL COMMITTEE. SURE IT WILL DO THAT ONCE WE GET A QUORUM THE DALLAS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ASSIMILATIONIST ARRIVED. NEXT UP IS A NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE FREE TO PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT AS WELL AS YOUR TEAM'S COMMITMENT TO HELPING OUR THIS BILL- I WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE ONE IS FOR THE FINANCIAL SECURITY. OF RETIRED SWORN PEACE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS WISEMAN THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS PROTECTING AND SERVING. DO YOU THINK EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEMS WHERE COUNTY MISINTERPRETING LOS THE FINANCIAL LIVELIHOOD OF RETIREES IS BEING CHALLENGED BY THE THREAT OF SUDDEN CALL BACKS. WITH MY DISTRICT CAPTAIN FROM ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY RETIRED DUE TO JOB RELATED INJURIES IN TWENTY TWENTY AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF SERVICE. HE RECENTLY WAS CONTACTED BY THE ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM- NOTED SO SERVICE WAS TOLD HE'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE SYSTEM SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ELEVEN THOUSAND. TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TAKE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HIS MONTHLY RETIREMENT GOING FORWARD. DUE TO ON CALL PAY BEING DISALLOWED. FOR DECADES THE COUNTY BOARD THE NORMAL CONTRIBUTION. TO ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH HISTORICALLY INCLUDED ON CALL PAY AND CANINE HAMMER PAINT. I JULY THIRTIETH TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CHAMPAGNE IN WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE ALAMEDA CASE IN HIS DECISION. THE COURT DETERMINED THAT THE VOLUNTARY ON CALL PAVE WAS NOT COMPENSATION OR NOBLE IN NEED WITH K. NINE HANDLER PAID. EVER SALT CLOSER STATED ITS INTENT TO CLAW BACK ANY PAYMENTS MADE TO RETIREES FOR ON CALL OR CANINE HANDLER PAY. LOCK OVER ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO PRESENT AND REDUCE MONTHLY PAYMENTS GOING FORWARD FOR RETIREES. WILL HAVE AFFECTED REDUCING SOME RETIREES MONTHLY PAYMENTS BY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS RATHER JUST APPLYING THIS TO YOU RETIREES. THIS CREATES A SUBSTANTIAL HARDSHIP RETIREES. THAT BUDGET BASED ON A FIXED INCOME. THE FINANCIAL I WILL HAVE FIREFIGHTERS AND PEACE OFFICERS SHOULD NOT BE DETERMINED BY REPORTING ERROR THROUGH NO FAULT OF THE EMPLOYEES. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE ONE SURE THAT IF A REPORTING ERROR IS TO OCCUR THROUGH NO FAULT OF THE EMPLOYEE THAT THE ONUS WE PLACE UPON THE EMPLOYER TO ENSURE THAT THESE RETIREES FOR SMALL PORTION OF THE FUTURE PENSION AMOUNTS THAT THEY WERE PROMISE. WE ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE TO FIND A RESOLUTION FOR THE CONCERNING PROVISION. NOTATING COMMITTEE AND ITS ANALYSIS HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME WE HAVE MR DUCKS REVERSE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS MISTER SHANE LEVINE REPRESENTING THE ASSOCIATION OF ORANGE COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFFS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSPECTIVES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT- THE CPF REPRESENTS MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS- AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES PERSONNEL ACROSS THE STATE- MANY OF OUR MEMBERS- RELY ON A SECURE RETIREMENT FROM A NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN AT COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEM- IN. LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT A MEASURE SB TWO SEVEN EIGHT BY SENATOR CENTER LEYVA THE PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR DISALLOWED COMPENSATION- AT FOR MEMBERS THAT RELY ON CALPERS FOR THEIR SECURITIZED. WE THINK THAT THIS MEASURE WILL BRING PARITY AND PROTECTION FOR DISALLOWED COMPENSATION TO- OUR MEMBERS LIKE THE FIREFIGHTER THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAD REFERENCED AND IN HIS OPENING- LIKE MANY RETIREES WHEN- OVER FIREFIGHTER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER RETIRES THEY RELY ON A FIXED MONTHLY PENSION TO MAKE THEIR DAY TO DAY NEEDS. AND UNLIKE MANY STEP A PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES MANY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES INCLUDING A SIZEABLE PERCENTAGE OF PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL DO NOT. RECEIVE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS SO FOR pMONTHLY PENSION IS OUR ONLY SOURCE OF INCOME AND WHEN THEIR NOTICE THAT THEY HAVE A DISALLOWED- BUT PAY ITEM THAT IS DISALLOWED THEN HAVE THIS CONSIDERABLE OVERPAYMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO REPAY AND A REDUCTION IN THE RETIREMENT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THEIR- ON THEIR ON THEIR LIFE AND THEIR RETIREMENT SO FOR THOSE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. THE THIS CHAIRMAN MACHINE LEVINE- ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION ORANGE COUNTY DE SHERIFFS ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. LET ME JUST FIRST BEGIN BY SAYING WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE- THE CHURN STAFF ON RESOLVING ANY- ANY ISSUES AROUND PROPOSED A IN THE BILL- THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE ANALYSIS ALL. BEGIN WITH THAT. AGAIN MY WAY BACKGROUND FOR DECADES COUNTY ORANGE PAID THE NORMAL CONTRIBUTION- SERVICE WHICH IS DIRECTLY INCLUDED ON CALL PAY IN CANINE HANDLER PASSED. THESE ITEMS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY OFFICERS TO BE PART OF THE COMPENSATION HERBAL CALCULATION AS SUCH PORTIONS OF THE EMPLOYER RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION IN THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE. TO ON CALL IN CANINE HANDLER PAY. ON JULY THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY THE COURT THIS CALPERS BRING FOR ISSUED WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE ALAMEDA DECISION. THE COURT DETERMINED THAT VOLUNTARY ON CALL PAY WAS NOT COMPENSATION OR DOUBLE AND NEITHER WAS CANINE HANDLER PAY AND AS A RESULT OSTER STATED ITS INTENT TO CLAW BACK ANY PAYMENTS MADE TO RETIREES FOR ON CALL. FOR CANINE HANDLER PAY FROM OCTOBER FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THROUGH THE PRESENT. IN TO REDUCE THOSE MONTHLY PAYMENTS GOING FORWARD FOR RETIREES. TO EXCLUDE THESE PAYS WHICH WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING SOME RETIREES MONTHLY INCOME. BY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP. IN AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE TO HELP WRITE A SIGNIFICANT WRONG AS WE SEE IT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR RETIREES BECAUSE OF THIS DECISION. MEMBERS OF OUR DEPARTMENT WHO WORKED THEIR CAREERS AND HIGH PROFILE UNITS SUCH AS HOMICIDE BOMB SQUAD OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS CANINE AND OTHER SPECIALIZED UNITS. WITHIN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE GAVE UP VALUABLE FAMILY TIME DURING EVENINGS HOLIDAYS AND WEEKENDS IN ORDER TO REMAIN AVAILABLE. TO MEDIATE WILL RESPOND WITHIN POLICY TO WORK WHEN CALLED UPON. MEMBERS THESE MEN AND WOMEN DID THEIR JOB AS THEY WERE REQUIRED AND REQUESTED AND IN RETURN THEY WERE PROMISED TO GUARANTEED WAGE AND GUARANTEED INCOME IN RETIREMENT. TO NOW BE TOLD BY THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM THERE WAS A MISTAKE IN THIS WAS A MISTAKE IN THIS MISTAKE IS TO BE BORNE BY THEM. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN IS AN INJUSTICE. THE EMPLOYEES ARE BASICALLY BEING TOLD NOW THEY WORK FOR A DISCOUNT. THE EMPLOYER I WOULD ARGUE STANDS TO GAIN A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL WINDFALL BECAUSE THIS PROPOSITION. THEY ULTIMATELY GET THE BENEFIT OF THIS BARGAIN. HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF RETIREES NOW STAND TO LOSE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN RETIREMENT NOT ONLY FROM CLAWBACKS BUT ON THE GO FORWARD. IT'S SIMPLY NOT RIGHT.

OUR THANK YOU THANK YOU SINGLE TO THE BILL YOU OVER BACK TO THE I'LL JUST MAKE A COMMENT QUICKLY MR COOPER THIS IS A GOOD BILL- FOR VARIETY REASONS NUMBER ONE IT STOPS THE CLAWBACK WHICH I EIGHT UNITS. CAN BE. A DRAMATIC FOR FOLKS TO COME UP WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY REAL QUICK RIGHT. AND IT GET OF A LETTER IN THE MAIL MAYBE EVEN A CHECK STOP THAT'S A BIG BIG DEAL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON A- NOT A LOT OF MONEY. AND THEN IT CREATES DUE PROCESS. AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED DUE PROCESS IN THIS ARENA SO THAT- PEOPLE GET A CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR CASE PEOPLE GET A CHANCE TO DO THIS IN PUBLIC. AND LOOK AT THE SPORT YOU HAVE ON THIS BILL RARELY DO YOU SEE THESE MANY STARS ALIGNED SO I COMPLIMENT YOU AND CERTAINLY YOUR CONSULTANT. ON A WORKING WITH A VARIETY OF INTEREST TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

WE'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE OF EDUCATORS. HELLO EVERYBODY THIS ROOM. WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT THIS PLAN LIFE. WASN'T FOR EDUCATORS I THINK TEACHERS BUT EDUCATORS IS. A WORD BUT I'LL- YOU GUYS DID AMAZING JOB. FOR WHAT YOU DO IT'S A TOUGH JOB. WE KNOW THAT HALF THE TEACHERS LEAVE AFTER FIVE YEARS BECAUSE. IT'S TOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS DO I COMMEND YOU. THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IS ABOUT FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH. YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE TEACHER SALARY RETIRED WITH FORTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT IS INSANE MOST OF THESE MISTAKES THAT ARE MADE ARE MADE BY THE DISTRICTS. BOTTOM LINE WE'VE LOOKED OVER THAT THE VAST MAJORITY MISTAKES SO THOSE DISTRICTS NEED DO A BETTER JOB OF ACCOUNTING THESE FOLS RETIREMENT BECAUSE IS THAT MS JACOBS SAID. SHE MADE A PLAN HERE'S MY TIME HERE'S MY SOCIAL SECURITY OF THE LIVE WITH THAT I WILL BE THE CUSHION. THAT CUSHIONS GOD STILL PAYING BACK THAT MONEY SHE'S BARELY HALFWAY THERE. SO IF IT'S NOT RIGHT ON THE BOTTOM LINE SOMEBODY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THAT IS THE DISTRICTS THAT MAKE THESE CALCULATIONS BOTTOM LINE PERIOD OF SHOULD DOUBLE CHECK AND TRIPLE CHECK IT PLUS YOU PROTECTED WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE WE WANT TO SHARE OUR EDUCATORS. ARE TAKEN CARE OF FOR DOING SUCH A DUTY. OF EDUCATING. BUT JUST ARE YOU FOR EVERY. AND- I SAID I WOULD NOT BE OUT HERE WITHOUT GOOD EDUCATE SO. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER AND IS ONE OTHER COMMENT. BUT PEOPLE NEED TO REALIZE TO THIS IS TEACHERS MONEY THEY PAID INTO THE SYSTEM THE CHECK WAS REDUCED EVERY MONTH. ON THE FIRST DAY OF EMPLOYMENT TO PAY IN. TO THIS PART OF MONEY TO ASSIST NOT LIKE A POT OF MONEY THAT'S SITTING OUT THERE THAT THEY CAN BE GIVING BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY PUT INTO THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER. AND MOST TEACHERS DON'T GET SOCIAL SECURITY THAT IS TRUE THE VAST MAJORITY LOOK AT SOCIAL SECURITY AND INSTEAD CALIFORNIA THEY WOULDN'T GET ANY UNLESS THEY HAVE SOME TYPE OF SIGNIFICANT PREVIOUS.
