BELIEF AMONG THE MAJORITY OF THE

MEMBERS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:41.899
ADD TO THE STATUTE IN A WAY THAT

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:43.000
SEPARATES PEOPLE FROM THEIR

YOU WHEN A PROPERTY GOES TO TAX

00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:05.722

MINIMALLY IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:07.491
THAT A PROPERTY OWNER HAS NOT

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:10.327
PAID THEIR PROPERTY TAXES THAT'S

00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:10.894
WHEN IT BECOMES DEFAULT IN

00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:11.828
ELIGIBLE. AND BEFORE WE CAN TAKE

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:13.564

CERTIFIED MILLIONS AND THIS IS

00:47:16.266 --> 00:47:17.534
EACH YEAR EVERY YEAR THAT THEY

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:18.702
HAVE NOT PAID THEIR TAXES SO

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:20.671
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.172
GOING TO CATCH ANYBODY OFF GUARD

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:22.906
UNLESS THEY'RE IN A POSITION

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:24.675
MENTALLY THAT THEY ARE NOT AWARE

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:26.577
OF THEIR OWN FINANCES IN WHICH

00:47:26.643 --> 00:47:28.278

HELP THE OWNER BECOME CURRENT

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:38.855
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:39.823
THAT'S REALLY STRUGGLING ON THE

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:40.991

DISLOCATION AND SAFETY ISSUES IN

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:46.809
OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR SOME OF THE

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:48.211

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.746
BEING ABLE TO USE YOUR WATER

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.814

BRING BACK SOME OF THE ENERGY

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.590
RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCE THAT

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:02.458
A LOT OF OUR CALIFORNIANS.

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.427
THOUGHT THEY HAD UNTIL THE LAST

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.895
SEVERAL YEARS WOULD RATHER NOT

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.463
HAVE OUTRAGEOUS WE'D RATHER HAVE

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.832
THE VERY SAFE ENERGY GRID- AND

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:12.001
WE THINK THIS WILL HELP US BUILD

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:14.070
IN SOME OF THE RELIABILITY THAT

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:15.238
WE ONCE HAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.672
AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER-

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:19.976
PRIMARY- I MEAN ANY ANY OTHER

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:22.111
WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:27.417
ANY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DO

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.619
WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:35.858
COMMITTEE. I'LL I'LL ASK WHEN I

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:38.327
TO YOUR PRIMARY WITNESS- WHAT

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:40.930
PERCENT OF THESE GENERATORS ARE-

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.465
DIESEL GENERATORS BECAUSE MY

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.367
CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE REALLY

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:46.035
YOU KNOW WE'RE BUT WE HAVE. BIG

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:49.005
GOALS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:52.141
AND WOULDN'T THIS JUST BE-

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.109
MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

01:01:53.176 --> 01:01:55.878
OF THAT POLICY SO IT DEPENDS ON

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.947
THE APPLICATION A LOT OF THESE

01:01:58.014 --> 01:01:59.248
GENERATORS ESPECIALLY FOR SOME

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:00.783
BUSINESSES WILL BE DIESEL

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.485
GENERATORS JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.986
DRIVE THE OUTPUT THAT'S

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.022
NECESSARY OR THESE THINGS- AT

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:07.423
THE SAME TIME WE DON'T EXPECT

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:08.891
THESE TO BE USED FREQUENTLY OR

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:11.327
USED OFTEN AND SO IT'S A MATTER

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.528
OF. PROVIDING THE BASIC

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:14.030
NECESSITIES OF LIFE WOULD LOVE

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.498
TO HAVE MORE MICRO GRIDS-

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.700
DEPLOYED WITH CLEAN ENERGY- BUT

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.302
UNLESS AND UNTIL THAT HAPPENS

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:21.938
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE POWER- AND

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:24.140
IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO MAINTAIN A

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:26.342
VIBRANT COMMUNITY AND A WORKING

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:31.180
pRELIABLE POWER. RIGHT THANK YOU

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:34.083
A- I WAS WAITING FOR YOU DOCTOR

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.987
FOR- I STILL WAS TRYING TO

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:42.325
FIGURE OUT THE FIRST TWO BILLS-

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:45.194
SO ON THIS ONE- I DO FOR YEAH

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:47.930
I'D- TO TRY AND SAY DO SOLAR AND

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:50.066
BATTERY SHE'S GOING TO BE FOUR

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:51.400
OR FIVE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE SO

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.636
I THINK. DIESEL IS THE ONLY-

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:59.242
MICHAEL LIKELY- ALTERNATIVE FOR

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:01.144
SOMEONE DOING BACKUP POWER

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.712
UNLESS THEY'RE JUST GETTING

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:05.214
SOLAR FOR DAY TO DAY USE. OUR

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.350
BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY EXPENSIVE

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.318
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU GO

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.521
TO DIESEL AND IT PROBABLY WON'T

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:12.655
BE USED ALL THAT OFF BECAUSE

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:13.956
FRANKLY THE GRADES CHEAPER THAN.

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:17.160
RUNNING OFF DIESEL FUEL HOWEVER.

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.162
WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WITH

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:22.331
ANY TAX CREDIT IS THAT IT GOES

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:24.167
TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:25.935
AND PERHAPS DR MISTER BIGELOW

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:28.838
COULD TALK TO ME ABOUT IT- IT'S

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:30.506
GOING TO GO TO EVERYBODY WHETHER

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.208
THEY NEED IT OR NOT WHETHER THEY

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:34.177
WOULD HAVE DONE THIS OR NOT.

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:37.246
USUALLY YOU HAVE A- TAX

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:39.148
INCENTIVE TO GET SOME PEOPLE TO

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:41.384
DO SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T. SO

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:44.453
THAT'S A CONCERN- THE OTHER

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.455
THING IS THIS IS GOING TO

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:47.857
INVOLVE A LOT OF MONEY. WOULD WE

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:50.927
BE BETTER OFF JUST HAVING A

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:51.861
GRANT PROGRAM. TO HELP PEOPLE

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.729
BUY THESE FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:55.198
OTHERWISE COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:56.732
THOSE ARE JUST QUESTIONS RIGHT

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:59.468
NOW BUT MISTER BIGELOW COULD

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.304
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT LATER. THANK

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.105

ISSUE THE GOOD NEWS IS. IS THAT

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:10.913
IT'S NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL DIESEL

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.951
LEFT. FROM FOSSIL FUELS- THE WE

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.053
ARE NOW WORKING ON TECHNOLOGY OF

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:19.622
DIESEL FROM RENEWABLES. AND IT'S

IMPACT OF THE UNAFFORDABILITY

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:24.426
HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO BUY A

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:26.828
HOME. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:27.862
EXASPERATING THAT EFFORT FOR

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:30.231
PEOPLE TO BUY HOMES IS THROUGH

01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:31.666
SPECULATION THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:34.602
NO PROBLEM AT ALL. AND I FULLY

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:35.403
WINNER PERCENT SUPPORT

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:38.006
INVESTORS- WELL I THINK

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:41.109
INVESTING MAKES A GREAT- MAKES

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:42.377
FOR A GREAT ECONOMY AND MAKES

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:45.647
FOR A SOLID ECONOMY. HOWEVER

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:48.016
WE'RE NOT- THE INTENT HERE IS TO

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:50.585
NOT. GO AFTER SPECIFICALLY

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:52.854
INVESTORS THIS IS TO GO AFTER

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.889
THOSE WHO ARE IF I READ IT

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:57.158
CORRECTLY WHO ARE SPECULATING

01:24:57.225 --> 01:25:00.228
AND THEY ARE IN IT FOR. A DOLLAR

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:03.364
THAT ACTUALLY DOES NOT EXIST-

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:05.767
THE RIVER FOR A DOLLAR IN AN

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:08.736
INFLATED ECONOMY- WHERE THERE'S-

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:10.772
WHERE HOUSING IS COMPLETELY

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:13.875
UNAFFORDABLE AND OVER AND- I

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.009
THINK MANY WOULD AGREE OVER

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:17.445
PRICED. AND SO WE THROUGH

01:25:17.512 --> 01:25:20.415
SPECULATION IT FORCES- A BUYER

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:22.650
TO ACTUALLY FINANCE EQUITY

01:25:22.717 --> 01:25:24.519
THAT'S AND THAT'S NOT THE THAT'S

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:26.688
NOT SUSTAINABLE AND SO WITH

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:29.057
THAT- I'M I'M NOT SURE OF THIS

01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:30.792
PATHWAY IS THE PATHWAY TO TAKE

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:32.727
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COMPASS. SO

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:36.231
MANY OTHER AREAS BUT I WOULD- I

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:39.000
WOULD OFFER TO JOIN YOUR EFFORT

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:40.969
AND TRY TO COME UP WITH A

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:43.505
PATHWAY THAT DOES INVOLVE- THE

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:45.940
INPUT FROM OPPOSITION. SO THAT

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:48.276
WE ARE REALLY CAPTURING THOSE

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:51.212
WHO ARE DOING THEIR GREGIS- WORK

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:54.649
OF SPECULATION AND NOT GO AFTER

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:57.185
THOSE WHO ARE. EXERCISING THEIR

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:59.621
RIGHT TO BE AN INVESTOR SO- AND

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.556
I SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:04.859
TWO- IS A MINUTE AS MIGHT BE.

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:06.194
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:06.728
GRAYSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:08.696
PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU MADAM

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:12.267
CHAIR- AND I TO ALL BEGIN BY

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.067
COMMENDING THAT THE AUTHOR I

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:14.736
THINK IN TERMS OF. YOUR INTENT

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:18.306
WITH THIS BILL AND BY THE GOAL

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:20.708
THAT YOU HAVE WITH THIS POLICY-

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:23.177
BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:24.112
ABOUT THE UNINTENDED

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:27.048
CONSEQUENCES AS A RAISED BY THE

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:29.751
OPPOSITION AND I THINK- IN. THE

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:31.085
FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON THAT

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:32.687
HOUSING PRICES IN THE STATE OF

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:33.788
CALIFORNIA ARE THROUGH THE ROOF

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:36.424
IS THAT WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:37.559
IMBALANCE BETWEEN DEMAND AND

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:39.327
SUPPLY RIGHT. DEMANDS TO HIS

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:42.931
SUPPLIES TOO LOW SO ANY POLICY

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:46.134
THAT I FURTHER CONSTRICT SUPPLY

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.770
IS ACTUALLY GOING TO EXACERBATE

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.471
THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT WE

01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:53.575
FACE RIGHT NOW. I'M AND I THINK

01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:57.545
THAT FIVE BY CONSTRAINING MARKET

01:26:57.612 --> 01:27:03.551
FLUIDITY THAT THAT IS. WHAT THE

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:05.820
BILL WOULD BE SO I'M- SURE

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:06.688
YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:08.089
CONCERN AND WOULD BE INTERESTED

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:10.391
IN IN YOUR- PERSPECTIVE ON THAT

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:17.098
. RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY. I

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:18.032
WAS JUST PASSING FROM IN CASE

01:27:18.099 --> 01:27:19.968
RESTORED WATER TO GIVE HIS

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:21.836
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT BUT TO. I

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:24.606
WILL OFFER MY COMMENTS WHICH ARE

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:25.807
GOING TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES'

01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:29.544
FRANKLY- I AGREE WITH MR GRACE

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.813
COVERS THE SAYS THAT YOU WANT IT

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:32.547
REALLY BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:35.083
BILL IS A SENSE THAT INVESTING

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:37.251
IN A RENTAL HOME MORE TO IS

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:40.088
OFTEN THE WA A FAMILY- BUILDS A

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:41.756
NEST EGG AND BUILD WEALTH AND

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:43.324
BUILD AN OPPORTUNITY AND THIS

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:45.660
IS- COUNTERPRODUCTIVE THIS

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:49.097
LEGISLATION YOU HAVE BEFORE ME.

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:50.665
NOW IF YOU WERE TO. I DON'T KNOW

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:51.866
IF THERE WERE SOME EXEMPTIONS IN

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:53.701
HERE A DIFFERENT THRESHOLD OR

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:54.636
PERHAPS TARGETING A DIFFERENT.

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:56.904
AUDIENCE THAN MAYBE. WE CAN GET

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:58.072
SOMEWHERE WITH THAT BUT THE

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.741
QUESTION I THINK I'M MORE

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:01.275
CURIOUS ABOUT IN MY TENTH. AND

01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:02.610
FINAL YEAR HERE AT THE STATE

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:05.880
LEGISLATURE- I'VE SEEN BILLS-

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.382
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PERIOD OF

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:09.984
TIME. ON HOUSING. LARGELY FOR

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:11.753
MEMBERS WHO REPRESENT URBAN

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:14.789
COMMUNITIES LIKE YOURSELF- AND I

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:16.157
DON'T. DISAGREE WITH MY

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:17.091
COLLEAGUES ON SURE YOUR

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:18.726
INTENTIONS ARE GOOD AND TRYING

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:19.861
TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:22.497
YOUR CONSTITUENTS- BUT IT JUST

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:23.598
SHOCKS ME THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:25.733
BE. ABOUT TWO MILLION THREE

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.268
MILLION HOMES UNDERSUPPLY IN

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:29.337
CALIFORNIA. AND NOBODY BRINGS

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:32.240
BILLS FORWARD. TO MAKE IT EASIER

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:34.876
TO BUILD CHEAPER TO BUILD MORE

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:39.547
WORK FORCE. AND THIS IS KIND OF-

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:42.116
I GUESS I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU I'D

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:42.850
LIKE TO HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE-

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:43.951
AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS A

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:45.720
MUCH LARGER COMMUTE IN THE

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:46.254
SMALL. RURAL COMMUNITIES I

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.789
REPRESENT BUT- THAT THAT THERE

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:49.390
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SO MANY

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.759
HURDLES TO BUILDING. NOT THE

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:53.528
LEAST OF WHICH IS IMAGINE THE

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:55.029
WORK FORCE THAT WOULD TAKE. WE

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:56.631
DON'T GRADUATE ENOUGH YOUNG

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:58.099
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY FROM HIGH

01:28:58.166 --> 01:28:59.734
SCHOOL THAT ARE QUALIFIED

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:01.369
CARPENTERS PLUMBERS PIPEFITTERS

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:03.371
ELECTRICIANS ARE PREPARED TO

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.139
PURSUE CAREERS- THAT WOULD

01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:07.942
ACTUALLY ALLOW US. TO BUILD OUR

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:09.944
BRONZE I THINK WE BUILD

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.446
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:12.513
A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES. TWO

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:13.881
HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:14.816
STATEWIDE MISTER GRAYSON MIGHT

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:16.617
KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ME I THINK

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.453
HE'S WELL FAMILIAR WITH THAT

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:19.387
INDUSTRY BUT-IT SEEMS ABSURD

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:21.823
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH UP ON

01:29:21.889 --> 01:29:23.458
A TWO MILLION HOME DEFICIT. WERE

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:25.193
BARELY BUILDING ENOUGH IF YOU

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:27.261
WANT TO BUILD A HALF A MILLION

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:29.530
HOMES. A YEAR- IT WOULD TAKE

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:30.531
FOUR TIMES THE WORK FORCE AND

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:32.567
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO TRAIN

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:33.668
THE WORKFORCE AND WE'RE NOT

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:35.737
MAKING- CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:37.505
ANY CHAMBER WE'RE NOT MAKING

01:29:37.572 --> 01:29:39.207
BUILDING ANY LESS COMPLICATED

01:29:39.273 --> 01:29:41.809
FASTER OR CHEAPER- AND YET WE

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.878
STILL KIND OF RECYCLE THE SAME

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:45.613
IDEAS OVER AND OVER AND OVER

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.915
AGAIN- IN IT YOU KNOW. FROM MY

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:48.783
POINT OF VIEW- NONE OF WHICH

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.551
SEEM LIKE THEY'RE IN THE REALM

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:51.619
OF SOLVING ANY OF THE PROBLEMS

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:53.888
SO I'LL LEAVE IT WITH THAT- I

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:56.257
APPLAUD YOUR- INTENTIONS BUT-

01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:57.325
DEFINITELY THINK THIS IS THE

01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:59.327
WRONG DRECTION- WOULD LOVE TO

01:29:59.393 --> 01:30:02.730
HAVE MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT IT

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.165
LIKE SAID HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.600
THE DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ALL

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:07.702
QUESTIONS. OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:08.503
START RESPOND WHATEVER THIS

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:09.771
YEAR'S PROGNOSIS OKAY- ASSEMBLY

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:11.439
MEMBER SMART. SO THIS BILL

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:13.508
CONTEMPLATES ADDING UP TO A

01:30:13.574 --> 01:30:15.009
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. CAPITAL

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:16.744
GAINS ON TOP OF THE ALREADY

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:19.046
CAPITAL GAINS CORRECT. SO

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:20.581
SOMEBODY IN THE TOP BRACKET OF

01:30:20.648 --> 01:30:22.850
LIKE SAY IN CALIFORNIA 13% AT

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:26.454
THE STATE LEVEL WOULD BE SUBJECT

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:29.123
TO BASICALLY A 38240% CAPITAL

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:31.359
GAINS TAX ON A PROPERTY THAT

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:32.226
THEY BOUGHT AND WRECKED

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:33.761
VERMISCHTES NUMBER YEAH AND THEN

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:36.063
PUT BACK ON THE MARKET WITH THE

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:37.565
EXCEPTION THAT THIS WOULD ALSO

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:39.066
BE EXEMPT FROM SOME OF THE

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:39.734
EXISTING CORPORATE- CAPITAL

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:41.269
GAINS TAX THEY ARE SUBJECT TO

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:43.671
FEDERAL- YOU KNOW. EXCHANGE

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.840
LOOPHOLES- IF THE PROPERTY

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:48.109
VALUES OUR PASSPORT SO IN

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:49.911
ADDITION TO THE MYRIAD OF ISSUES

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:50.778
THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:52.847
ALREADY- YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:54.182
THESE CYCLES THESE HOUSING

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:55.883
CYCLES AND IT THIS IS PROBABLY

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.852
THE WORST IS IN IN TERMS OF

01:30:57.919 --> 01:31:02.623
SUPPLY SIDE. OF HOUSES AND- YOU

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:04.358
KNOW I I'LL I'VE ALSO SEEN

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:06.460
PEOPLE THAT ARE SPECULATING-

01:31:06.527 --> 01:31:09.096
LOSE THEIR LIFE SAVINGS- THAT'S

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:10.231
WHY THEY CALL IT SPECULATING

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:11.732
THERE'S THEY'RE GUESSING THAT

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.434
IT'S GOING TO GO UP. AND WHEN IT

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:15.002
WHEN THE MARKET IS LIKE IT IS

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:16.938
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT RAPID EQUITY

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:19.874
RISE- A. B. YOU KNOW SURE

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:21.876
THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:23.177
AND THERE'S A WHOLE ECONOMY THAT

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:25.046
LIVES OFF OF THAT BY THE WAY AND

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:26.781
THERE THE WORKERS THERE THEIR

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:28.282
PEOPLE TO GO IN AND- REDO THE

01:31:28.349 --> 01:31:29.517
WALLS A REDO THE FLOORING AND

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:31.586
BRING THE HOUSE BACK UP TO. A

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:33.087
LIVABLE CONDITION BASICALLY

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.989
BEFORE THE PERSON THAT BOUGHT IT

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:36.757
PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET AND

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:38.025
HOPEFULLY MAKES ENOUGH TO COVER

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:40.962
WHAT THE DAY SPENT- FIXING THE

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:43.464
HOUSE UP- SO EASY THESE BILLS

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:46.100
ARE A LITTLE SCARY TO ME BECAUSE

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:47.869
I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:31:47.935 --> 01:31:49.704
ADJUSTING MARKET ARTIFICIALLY-

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.472
WHEN I THINK IT'S BEEN CLEARLY

01:31:51.539 --> 01:31:52.673
STATED THE PROBLEM WITH THE

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.809
MARKET IS WE HAVE WAY LESS

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:56.777
SUPPLY THEN WE HAVE DEMAND. AND

01:31:56.844 --> 01:32:01.582
WE HAVE TO FIX THAT SIDE. AND

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.517
THESE THINGS DON'T FIX THAT.

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:04.552
RIGHT WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:08.656
QUIRK- JUST TO CORRECT SOMETHING

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:10.858

CORRECT YEAH SO ONE OF THE

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:23.237
THINGS HE OPPOSITION RAISED IS

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.205
NOT A CONCERN BUT WHAT ABOUT

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:27.575
PEOPLE WHO OWN ONE OR TWO HOMES-

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:32.346

WELL OR VACANCY RATE IS HORRIBLY

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:53.367
LOW. ESPECIALLY IN SOME MARKETS-

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:54.802
THAT WOULD BE A CHOICE WHEN YOU

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:56.003
ARE ACQUIRING THAT PROPERTY IF

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:57.838
YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:59.774
HOLD ONTO IT FOR MORE THAN SEVEN

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.242
YEARS YOUR YOUR HOME FREE BUT IF

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:02.677
YOUR INTENT IS TO POSSIBLY GET

OF THAT. YOU SHOULD BE SUBJECT

01:33:07.448 --> 01:33:09.550
TO THIS- COUNTERACTED MANY WHAT

01:33:09.617 --> 01:33:11.619
ABOUT THESE FOLKS TO GO AND TAKE

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:13.654
A HOME THAT'S IN TERRIBLE SHAPE

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:15.823
AND THEN FIX IT UP- IN MY

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:17.625
CLOTHES I DID WANT TO ADDRESS

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:18.726
THAT BECAUSE I MET WITH MANY OF

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:19.827
THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:22.063
SOMETHING THAT WOULD NEED TO BE

01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.663
ADDRESSED. OKAY SO YOU WOULD

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:23.898
ADDRESS THAT THE OTHER THING

01:33:23.965 --> 01:33:25.800
THAT'S BROUGHT UP IN THE

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:30.905
ANALYSIS IS CONCERNED THAT.

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:31.806
PEOPLE WOULD IN FACT KEEP. KEEP

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:34.308
THE HOMES ARE. OFF THE MARKET

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:36.344
FOR SEVEN YEARS POSSIBLY.

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:38.846
PROBABLY RENTING THEM. SO THAT

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:41.415
THEY- BE LIVABLE SEVEN YEARS

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:43.617

PRODUCTS AND CERN'S OVER-

01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:51.392

FOR PURPOSES A LONG TERM RENTALS

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.495
AND THE INFLUENCE AT THAT CAN

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:55.730
HAVE A RENTAL PRICING HOWEVER.

01:33:55.796 --> 01:33:57.732
WE NEED RENTAL HOUSING AS WELL

01:33:57.798 --> 01:33:59.133
THE VACANCY RATES THAT ARE

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.668
HORRIBLY LOW TODAY ARE LARGELY

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:02.636
WHAT IS DRIVING UP THE COST. OF

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:05.506
RENTS AND SO- FOR THE PUPOSES

01:34:05.573 --> 01:34:07.875

ARE IS INDIVIDUAL OR ANY ENTITY

THAT IS ACQUIRING A PROPERTY SAY

FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN

01:34:14.281 --> 01:34:16.183
FLIPPING AT HOME- IMPROVEMENTS

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:17.818

MILLION SHORT TIME LATER.

01:34:19.286 --> 01:34:20.721
BECAUSE ALL YOU'RE DOING IS A

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.390
RAISING THE PRICE OF THAT SALE

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:24.125
IF YOU SIT ON THAT PROPERTY FOR

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:25.092

DO MORE ON SUPPLY LEGISLATION IN

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:29.623
FACT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE SOME OF

01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:30.658
THE BREAKTHROUGHS THAT THIS

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:31.959
LEGISLATURE DID ACHIEVE LAST

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:34.562
SESSION LAST YEAR TO BE ABLE TO

01:35:34.628 --> 01:35:35.763
MOVE. FORWARD ON SOME PRODUCTION

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:36.730
RELATED QUESTIONS THAT HAD

01:35:36.797 --> 01:35:39.233
PREVIOUSLY- STYMIED- THIS BODY

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.168
TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PASS AND

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.536
I KNOW YOU WERE SET PIVOTAL VOTE

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:44.572
AND SOME OF THOSE AS WELL WE

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.807
NEED TO BUILD ON TOP OF THAT AS

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:47.775
WELL I DON'T DISAGREE. THE

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:49.443
LARGEST PART THOUGH OF ACQUIRING

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:51.912
SITES FOR DEVELOPERS LARGE COST

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:52.580
OF DEVELOPMENT IS LAND

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:55.082
ACQUISITION. AND SO WHEN WE

01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:56.617
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:58.719
FOR- FEES OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:35:58.786 --> 01:36:01.155
REGULATIONS OR LABOR COSTS OR

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:02.857
OTHER ISSUES LET'S NOT LOSE

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:04.692
SIGHT THAT MORE THAN 60% OF THE

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:06.360
TRANSACTION IS FINALLY IN THE

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:07.928
FIRST PLACE. AND I'LL GIVE AN

01:36:07.995 --> 01:36:09.730
EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT WE HAD A

01:36:09.797 --> 01:36:11.632
LARGE PROPERTY THAT WAS SLATED

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:12.833
FOR THREE THOUSAND HOMES IT WAS

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.969
PURCHASED IT WAS WRONG LAND WAS

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.770
PURCHASED FOR- TWENTY MILLION

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:19.039
DOLLARS. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO

01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:20.508
YEARS LATER IT WAS PURCHASED BY

01:36:20.574 --> 01:36:22.076
ANOTHER EQUITY FIRM FOR FORTY

01:36:22.143 --> 01:36:24.078
MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:25.479
SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:26.547
THAT EQUITY FIRM PASS IT ON TO A

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.582
DEVELOPER FOR FIFTY EIGHT

01:36:28.649 --> 01:36:30.584
MILLION DOLLARS SO YOU HAD A

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:32.653
2100% GROWTH. JUST IN THE PRICE

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.922
OF LAND AND ALL OF THAT IS GOING

01:36:34.989 --> 01:36:35.923
TO BE PASSED ON TO THOSE

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:37.558
EVENTUAL RENTERS ARE HOMEOWNERS

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:39.093
SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.661
GET AROUND SPECULATION SHORT

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.196
TERM SPECULATION BECAUSE IT

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:46.167
AFFECTS THE COSTS. OF

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:46.901
DEVELOPMENT NOW SEE THAT THIS

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:47.701
ISN'T SOMETHING THAT IS A

01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:48.769
PRESIDENT CAL. I MISS EARLIER

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:50.771
SPECULATION IS HAPPENING

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:51.605
WORLDWIDE. OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:53.440
INSTITUTED A PROPERTY TAX MODEL

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:55.576
JUST LIKE THAT JUST LIKE THIS-

01:36:55.643 --> 01:36:57.211
GERMANY NEW ZEALAND CHINA AND

01:36:57.278 --> 01:36:59.380
SOME CANADIAN PROVINCES. BECAUSE

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:00.514
THEY SEE THAT THIS CAN ACTUALLY

01:37:00.581 --> 01:37:02.550
AFFECT BEHAVIOR- AND THEY PUT

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:04.151
CONTROLS IN PLACE WITH VARYING

01:37:04.218 --> 01:37:06.120
TERMS. NOW THE REST OF CANADA

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:07.054
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER

01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:08.756
COUNTRIES ARE STUDYING THE SAME

01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:10.524
WITH A SERIOUS INTEREST. ON

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:12.793
ENACTING POLICY AS WE OFTEN TOUT

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.994
AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN

01:37:14.061 --> 01:37:15.563
THE WORLD CALIFORNIA. SHOULD BE

01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:17.398
EXPLORING THIS AS WELL. I THINK

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:19.266
KNOWLEDGE THIS NEEDS WORK WE

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.402
CANNOT ADVERSELY AFFECT SUPPLY

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:23.237
AND PRODUCTION. NEEDS AND WE

01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:25.973
pPROPERTY. AND THEIR FEAR

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.541
ARGUMENTS THAT HOME IMPROVEMENT

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:28.442
SPECIALIST SOME CALL THEM

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:30.878
FLIPPERS. NEED ACCOUNTING FOR.

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:32.146
THESE ARE QUESTIONS I HOPE TO

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:33.614
WORK ON WITH THE HOUSING

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:34.615
COMMITTEE DISCUSSION OF IT GOT

SHE WOULD BE USING OUR TAX

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:41.655
POLICY. TO AFFECT A BEHAVIOR

01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:42.957
CHANGE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS IS

01:37:43.023 --> 01:37:45.092
GREATEST NEED. IS IT WORTHY TO

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:46.961
MOVE FORWARD. THIS COMMITTEE

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:49.296

ASK SO IS THIS INTENDED AS A

02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:14.506
REWARD BECAUSE I THINK RATHER

02:05:14.573 --> 02:05:16.308
THAN INCENTIVE BECAUSE MOST

02:05:16.375 --> 02:05:17.843
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET THIS ARE

02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:19.778
PEOPLE WHO EMPLOY OUT LIKE YOUR

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:21.313
RECYCLING CENTER EMPLOYEE THEM

02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:24.450
ALREADY AND I JUST- I'M NOT SURE

02:05:24.516 --> 02:05:26.585
THAT YOU GET THAT MANY MORE.

02:05:26.652 --> 02:05:28.487
PEOPLE EMPLOYING. THERE IS

02:05:28.554 --> 02:05:30.456
SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:32.424
SUBSIDIZING THE PEOPLE WHO WORK

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:34.393
THERE ALREADY SO WHAT IS THE

02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:37.062
INTENT OF YOUR BILL. IT REALLY

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:42.301
IS- IN INCENTIVES AND- THAT MADE

02:05:42.368 --> 02:05:45.037
FIVE TELL YOU OF A LITTLE BIT OF

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:46.672
THE CONVERSATION THAT I HAD

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:50.643
WITH. A FORMER SENATOR SHE HAD A

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:53.379
SON WHO IS DISABLED AND THERE

02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:55.414
WAS A BILL THAT PASSED THE

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:57.983
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT- REYES

02:05:58.050 --> 02:06:02.554
THE- MINIMUM WAGE FOR. SPECIAL

02:06:02.621 --> 02:06:05.124
NEEDS FOLKS AND HER SON LOST HIS

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:08.794
JOB BECAUSE OF IT- SO THERE ARE

02:06:08.861 --> 02:06:10.296
MANY EMPLOYERS THAT ARE

02:06:10.362 --> 02:06:12.298
OPERATING VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGE

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:14.566
AND REALLY DO HAVE BIG HEARTS

02:06:14.633 --> 02:06:16.468
BUT JUST CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:17.803
WITHOUT THAT LITTLE EXTRA

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:20.039

ABILITY TO BE PART OF THAT

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:43.862
