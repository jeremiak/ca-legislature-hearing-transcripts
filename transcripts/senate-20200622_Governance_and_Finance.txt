AND LET'S GET INTO WHAT WE- TO COPIER HERE'S BE KICKING A SOFT WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER TO SAN BRADFORD. TO PROVIDE- THE PRESENTATION ON IS SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TEN HAPPY MONDAY SENATOR WE WELCOME YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB FOURTEEN TEN. AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO ENSURE RENTER FAMILIES AND LANDLORDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. REMAIN SOLVENT DURING THESE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES- THIS ISSUE IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT I'M HEARING FROM MY CONSTITUENTS IT'S THAT IMPORTANT. AS YOU ARE AWARE THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC HAS HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED AFFECT ON CALIFORNIANS. SINCE THE ONSET OF COVERT NINETEEN AND THE SHELTER PLACE ORDER BY THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED HISTORIC JOB LOSSES. THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED LAST FRIDAY THAT THE CURRENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS SIXTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT. WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PEAK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. WHILE THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD HAD HAVE HELPED PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. THESE BENEFITS DO NOT FULLY REPLACE THE LOST INCOME AND WILL NOT LAST IN PERPETUITY. THIS PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER EXACERBATED THE STRUGGLE FOR MANY TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IN JANUARY AND ANALYSIS BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. SHOWED OVER 50% OF CALIFORNIANS PAID 30% OR MORE OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON HOUSING COSTS THIS MAKES THEM. RENT BURDENED AS A RESULT MANY RENTERS HAVE STRUGGLED TO PAY THE RENT IN FULL OR IN PART SINCE THE ONSET OF THE CORONA VIRUS. IN APRIL 24% OF RENTERS WERE UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT ON TIME WHICH HAS INCREASED 230% IN JUNE ACCORDING TO A RECENT NATIONWIDE STUDY. WITHOUT STATE INTERVENTION THE NUMBER OF RENTERS UNABLE TO MEET THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS WILL REMAIN HIGH- CONTINUE TO GROW AS FULL ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM KOBE NINETEEN. IS LIKELY STILL A LONG WAY OFF. SB FOURTEEN TEN PUTS FORTH FOUR KEY COMPONENTS. IT CREATES COLBERT NINETEEN EVICTION RELIEF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TENANT AND THE LANDLORD. IT VOIGTS ANY DEMAND FOR UNPAID RENT OR ADDICTION ACCRUED DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD THERE AFTER. RIGHT TO PERSONAL INCOME OR CORPORATE TAX CREDIT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF RENT FORGIVEN. FOR LANDLORDS ARE PROPERTY OWNERS WHICH CAN BE SOLD FOR IMMEDIATE CASH RELIEF ARE USED BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AT THE ELECTION OF THE LANDOWNER. AND REQUIRES TENANTS TO REPAY THE RENT TO THE STATE IN ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR NOT TO EXCEED TEN YEARS. FINALLY THE BILL FURTHER PROVIDES AID TO RENTERS BY ALLOWING QUALIFYING PARTICIPANTS THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO FORGIVE SOME. OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED RENT BASED ON INDIVIDUAL INCOME. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE PODIUM OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR BRADFORD TO FURTHER HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFITS THIS BILL PROVIDES TO LANDLORDS THANK YOU. SENATE CAREER THANK YOU SO MUCH IF WE'RE GONNA VEGAS PAS ONE SECOND SIR BRADFORD REMAINED A QUICK. THIS IN FACT OF THE PODIUM AND THE MICROPHONE. ONCE I THINK YOU'RE SERGEANTS WERE WORKING OVERTIME THESE DAYS THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER BRADFORD GOOD MORNING THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ON I'M HONOR TO JOIN KERR AND PRESENT US BE FOURTEEN CAN. AND AS WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF COLD AT NINETEEN AND THEY HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD ON WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS HOUSEHOLDS MANY OF THESE FAMILIES ARE RENTERS AND SOME MORE SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS IT IS ESTIMATED. EVEN BEFORE COLBERT NINETEEN STRUCK OVER MILLION A RUNNERS WERE STRUGGLING TO- MAKE RENTAL PAYMENTS IN ITS RUNNERS ARE STRUGGLING THOSE LANDLORDS ARE STRUGGLING AS WELL AS BE FOURTEEN TEN IS UNIQUE AMONG RESPONSES TO COVER BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES BOTH SIDES OF THIS EQUATION BOTH THE RENTERS AND- LANDLORDS THE BILL WILL KEEP TENANTS HOUSING KEEP PROPERTIES OUT OF FORECLOSURE. AS SENATOR CAFIERO STATED THIS IS A VITAL MEASURE FOR TENANTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING THIS BILL IS NOT A HAND OUT FOR ME THE RENTER OR THE LANDLORD BY HAND. IN ADDITION TO THE ROOM PROTECTION SMALL LANDLORDS WILL RECEIVE TAX CREDITS IN EXCHANGE FOR NOT EVICTING PARTICIPATING TENSE. AS INTENDED TAX CREDITS CAN BE USED IN A ANNUAL INCREMENTS OF TEN YEARS STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THESE TAX CREDITS CAN ALSO BE SOLD BY THE LANDLORD. WE HAVE GOOD INDICATIONS THAT THERE IS A MARKET AND A GREAT INTEREST FOR THESE TAX CREDITS. FOR PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD REDUCE RENTAL INCOME BECAUSE OF CALL THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP AVOID FORECLOSURE AGAIN THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF A LANDLORD FOR CLOSES THE TENET IS. ON HOUSE AS WELL. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING MEASURES. THERE ARE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BY RENTAL PROPERTY AS A WAY TO PAY FOR COLLEGE TUITION AS A WAY TO PAY FOR RETIREMENT OR AS A WAY TO BUILD GENERATIONAL WEALTH. PROPERTY OWNERS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO OUR PROPERTY OWNERSHIP BY SISSY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO FOR BLACK AND LATINO FAMILIES HISTORICALLY. BANKS AND EMPLOYERS EXCLUDED THEM FROM TRADITIONAL MEANS OF BUILDING AN INTER GENERATIONAL WEALTH RACISM AND PREJUDICE MADE IT HARDER FOR MANY TO INVEST. OR OWN ASSETS PROPERTY AND OTHER ITEMS THIS IS THE IS VISIBLE TODAY IN THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE AVERAGE BLACK AN AVERAGE WHITE FAMILY INCOME AVERAGE WHITE HOUSE SOLD HAS TEN TIMES. MORE WEALTH THAN AVERAGE BLACK COAT ALSO- LATINO HOUSE SO WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE FORECLOSURE OF RENTAL PROPERTIES WOULD MOM AND POP OWNERS- CAN. EXACERBATE THIS PROBLEM THIS IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR TENANTS AND LANDLORDS BUT IT'S ALSO BAD FOR EQUITY IN OUR ECONOMY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSING EQUATION MANY TENANTS AND LANDLORDS ARE NOW STRUGGLING. THE IS THE ONLY PROPOSAL I'M AWARE OF THAT PROTECTS BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION WHILE PROTECTING OUR GENERAL FUND AS WELL. IT IS IT DOES SO BECAUSE TENANTS MUST REPAY MISS RENT IF THEY CAN. AND THE TAX CREDITS WILL START TO MATURE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THIS IS THE PROPER RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS THIS IS NOT. A SMALL PROPOSAL BUT THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE PROPOSAL TO HELP TRIP ADDRESS THOSE ARE MOST IN NEED. HIS REASON BECAUSE NO PARTICIPANT WILL LOSE THEIR HOME FOR THEIR PROPERTY. BOTH SENATOR CAFIERO AND ARE CLEAR THE DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE.

AND ALSO THE STATE YOU'RE FROM THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION. WE OPPOSE THIS BILL THIS CURRENTLY WRITTEN BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A HOLISTIC CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH. AIMED AT WHAT IS NECESSARY WHICH IS ONE HELPING VULNERABLE RENTERS WHO HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE STATE OF EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN ARISING OUT OF THE CODE BUT NINETEEN. YOUR SISTER SMALL LANDLORDS INVITING A TAX CREDIT IN FOUR YEARS IN LIEU OF HAVING A- ABILITY TO OBTAIN RESOURCES NOW WHEN IT'S NEEDED WILL NOT HELP- SMALL LANDLORDS IT WILL EXACERBATE- IN THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE FORECLOSURES IT WILL ALSO EXACERBATE THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE HOMELESSNESS AND LAWSUITS ARE ASSOCIATION IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL PARTIES TO COME UP WITH THE HOMELESS A CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTION. THIS BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN DOES NOT DO THAT- THOUGH I LOOK FORWARD ALONG WITH OUR LOBBYIST TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS AND THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERS TO TRY AND CRAFT A HOLISTIC SOLUTION THAT BENEFITS BOTH THE VULNERABLE RENTERS WHO WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS WELL AS THE HOUSING PROVIDERS WHO ALL WE WANT TO DO.

OPPOSITION SB FOURTEEN TEN THIS IS LAST CALL. AFTER REPRINT FOR LAST CALL NO ONE ELSE HAS CHOSE TO QUEUE UP AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH **** LAYS IN GENERAL COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA BE BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. WE'RE GONNA KICK OFF WITH OUR MAJORITY LEADER MISTER HURTS FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- I WANT TO SAY THAT- IN LISTENING TO THE COMMENTS HERE FIRST OF ALL WANT TO SAY THAT TO. SENATOR BRADFORD IS THE CO CHAIR. OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY EFFORT. LED BY THE PRO TEM AND THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT IDEAS THAT IS BEING FORMED OR THAT GROUP. AND I WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S A BALANCE IN MANY RESPECTS AS WE FACE. NOT JUST THE PANDEMIC. BUT THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THAT PANDEMIC. BOTH WITH RESPECT TO KEEPING PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS ON THE ONE HAND. AT THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATIVELY CREATE RESOURCES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRINT MONEY BUT THE NOTION IS THAT HOW DO YOU DO THIS WHERE YOU CAN CREATE DEBT RELIEF BUT WITHOUT PUTTING ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON THE BUDGET THAT IS REQUIRED. TO PAY FOR SO MANY THINGS FROM EDUCATION TO THE ARRAY OF SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED. THAT'S THE TEST THAT WHICH INFORMS OUR THINKING. IAN THE ARE COMING UP WITH ECONOMIC RECOVERY KEEPING PEOPLE FROM BEING HOMELESS. AND YET BEING THOUGHTFUL IN TRYING TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. NUMBER ONE IS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH RESPECT TO THE OPPOSITION. THAT SEEMS TO BE MISSING HERE. IS THAT THE TAX CREDITS ARE SIMPLY A MECHANISM THAT THAT WAS TO DEVISE TEAR. TO LESSEN THE BURDEN ON CURRENT BUDGET AND GIVE US HEADROOM TO BE ABLE TO GET THE RECOVERY IN FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. LANDLORDS CONSOLE THOSE THEIR MISCIBLE SECURITIES THEIR COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE DISCOUNT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BILL IT SAYS YOU CAN START SELLING THEM IN TWENTY THEIR VALUABLE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. ALL ONE HAS TO DO IS LOOK AT THE MARKETS IN TERMS WITH THE DISCOUNT RATES ARE TODAY WE KNOW THAT A- TREASURY SIXTEEN BASIS POINTS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN ONE TENTH OF 1% WE KNOW THAT. THAT A- IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO BUY A CD FOR A YEAR IT'S ABOUT 1% SO WE KNOW INTEREST RATES ARE REALLY LOW. RIGHT CENTER CONVEYANCE EXACTLY CORRECT. SO THE DISCOUNT WILL BE SMALL SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THE LANDLORD IF THEY NEED THE CASH TO PAY THEIR BILLS. THAT WAS THE THEORY BEHIND THIS COMPROMISE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS ECONOMIC RECOVERY EFFORTS CENTER BRAD FOR YOU SHOULD KNOW. COULD SIMPLY SELL THAT'S THAT MONEY AND PAY THE MORTGAGE. OR ANY OTHER BILLS THE TO PAY TO STAY ALIVE. SO THAT SO THAT THAT. PROVIDES A LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY. AND OUR- TO PROTECT BOTH THE LANDLORD ON THE ONE HAND TO MAKE SURE THEY GET SOME REVENUE. AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND TO MAKE SURE THE TENET DOESN'T BECOME HOMELESS. IT IS SENATOR CABALLERO TALKED ABOUT. THE IDEAS THIS IS NOT A FREE LUNCH. THAT YOU GOT TO PAY BACK THE LOAN. THAT THE LOAN SIX MONTHS DON'T TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I MIGHT WANT TO SUGGEST AS WE GO FORWARD THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT CD MAYBE I MISTER COLLEGE EYES. GET BACK THE REST. WE'RE GONNA BE OUT IN THE NEAR TERM. BUT IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE GOING FORWARD YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB THERE'S A SCHEDULE INSIDE THAT SET FORTH THE ANALYSIS IN THE BILL. THAT SAYS HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO PAY BACK IF YOU HAVE REAL ECONOMIC HARDSHIP YOU WON'T. AND IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY YOU THEN GOT TO PAY IT BACK OVER TIME THIS IS A BRIDGE. IT'S A BRIDGE WHICH BASED UPON RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S A BRIDGE BASED UPON THE ABILITY. OF BY THE GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO REDUCE ITS CURRENT DEMAND ON THE BUDGET SO WE DON'T. OTHERWISE HAVE A CATALYTIC EFFECT OF ALL THE OTHER THINGS ON THE BUDGET. IT IS REALLY AN ELEGANT SOLUTION. IN MANY RESPECTS BECAUSE OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER ASPECT. OF THE- FROM TAX CREDITS. AND I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST AS THE FOLKS WHO OPPOSED IF YOU WOULD DO SOME RESEARCH HE WILL FIND IS WE'VE DONE THIS IF YOU HOLD ON TO THE TAX CREDITS FOR YEAR. IF YOU COULD AFFORD TO CAN'T THE JYSK SOLEMN. YOU MIGHT GET EIGHTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IF YOU GET A HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE IF YOU GET ELEVEN HER DOLLAR RENT. AND YOU GET A HUNDRED DOLLARS THE TENET AND EIGHT HER DOLLARS THE SALE OF YOUR TAX CREDIT. YOU GET NINE HER DOLLARS INSTEAD OF ELEVEN HER DOLLARS THAT UNIT. IT KEEPS YOU ALIVE. BUT IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD ON TO IT. FOR A YEAR. IT APPEARS THAT IT CONVERTS TO. CAPITAL GAINS. TAX RATE GOES DOWN DRAMATICALLY FROM ORDINARY INCOME OF WHAT YOU WOULD GET. AS INCOME. AS A LANDLORDS CAPITAL GAINS NOW THERE'S NO CAPITAL GAINS IN THE STATE BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS. SO IF YOU FACTOR THAT IN. THE REALITY IS. TIME VALUE OF MONEY PLUS THE CAPITAL GAINS TREATMENT. YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MAKE MORE MONEY. ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS GO TO YOUR ACCOUNT AND FIND OUT IF YOU CAN AFFORD IF YOU CAN'T DO YOU SELL IT. BUT I WANTED TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE. ZERO THIS OF THIS IDEA OF THE FOUR YEARS IS NOT HAVING ANYBODY TO HOLD ON YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD ON YOU'RE GONNA JUST GET PAID YOU GET PAID A LITTLE BIT LESS BUT YOU GET PAID MRE THAN YOU WOULD PAY. IF YOU HAD TO A VICTOR TENET THINK ABOUT THIS FROM A SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVE I'M SORRY THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT SOME SORT OF GOES ALONG TO TERMS CAN BE TWO MORE MINUTES THREE MORE MINUTES PROBABLY TIMES THREE- BUT- EVENT. THE NOTION IS THAT YOU DON'T WHAT'S THE COST TO SOCIETY AND THE GOVERNMENT IF EVERYBODY GETS THROWN OUT WHAT ARE WE DOING THE FOLKS ON THE OTHER HAND RIGHT. SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ONE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY IS TO BE PAID MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT THE FACT THAT THAT A- THE TEN IT ACTUALLY HAS TO MAKE A SHOWING THAT THEY HAVE A NEED. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S THE APPARENT THING TALKING TO A NUMBER OF LANDLORDS QUITE FRANKLY MOST PEOPLE ARE PAYING THE RENTS BUT IF YOU HAVE A NEED. AND YOU REALLY IN TROUBLE WE GET TAKE AREA TO MAKE SURE NOT PHONE APPS THE MAYBE THE ISSUE OF THE COLIN TERMS SHOWING INDEED. SECONDLY THAT I TALKED ABOUT WAS CENTER BRADFORD ACTUALLY THIS WEEKEND WOULD YOU GO. THE NOTION IS THAT MAYBE YOU GOTTA MAKE SO THERE IS I'M SORRY. MAYBE MAYBE YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME LEVEL OF THE PAYMENT IF YOU COULD REPORT FIFTY DOLLARS MAYBE MAKE SOME PAYMENT. TO MAKE THAT APPROACH. THIRTY IS. THAT THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN IT SAYS THAT THE LENGTH OF THE- COLD WITH NINETEEN. URGENCY AND MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME DEFINITION IT'S BLANK PLUS NUMBER MONTHS. MAYBE HAVE SOME CERTAINTY IN TERMS OF FILLING UP THAT BLANKET STILL BLANK THAT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF A- LITTLE BIT ATTENTION. AND FOURTHLY MAYBE. IF YOU IF YOU'RE TROUBLED AND YOU AGREE TO SAY SIX MONTHS AND YOU GET A JOB MONTH THREE. MAYBE IT THERE SOME STATEMENT ABOUT YOUR ABILITY IF YOU START GETTING A JOB OR SOMETHING HAPPENS YOUR LIFE CHANGES. THAT THAT IT'S MORE OF A FAIRNESS IN TERMS OF THE BALANCE IN ALL OF THESE THINGS. THE OTHER THE ONLY OTHER SHOULD WANT TO RAISE THAT ACTUALLY CAME TO ME THIS WEEKEND. WAS WHAT'S THE IN A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS BILL AND SOME OF THE LOCAL MORATORIUM'S. IF YOU ACCEPT READ HOW DOES THAT WORK IN RELATIONSHIP OF WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING SHOULD WE HAVE PRECEDENCE OVER THIS. WHAT HAPPENS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SIX SIX TO DO THIS. IS A QUESTION. BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS DOES DEAL WITH THE VULNERABLE. IT DOES DEAL WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE PROTECTED. ARM IT IT REALLY IS THE CO AUTHORS YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED HARD ON THIS TOGETHER WITH THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY GROUPS AND REBELS BEEN PART OF THAT- TO FOR AN ELEGANT SOLUTION TO TRY TO MEET THE MIDDLE. AND A GUIDE TO DEAL WITH THE BALANCING OF ALL OF THE ISSUES TE- LAST THING I WANT TO SAY THAT IS WHERE I STARTED OUT WITH. IS THAT THE EFFORT IT ECONOMIC RECOVERY CENTER BRAD FOOD TELL YOU HIS CLOTHES. IT'S NOT JUST. TO WRITE ABOUT TWO CHECKS TODAY. BUT TO AVOID SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAD THROUGH SERIES OF PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS FOR ME HAD DOWNTURNS. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HOPE WE DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TO WE DON'T. KNOW CUT EDUCATION CUT SOME BASIC SOCIAL SERVICES CRITICAL ELEMENTS. THAT THEN CAUSE FURTHER PROBLEMS BUT THAT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY MODEL GIVES A WINDOW AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOES AND I ASK. THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE'S GREAT A SOCIETAL PRESSURES HERE THAT ARE MUCH BIGGER THAN WHAT'S BEFORE YOU THAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE IN TRYING TO COME UP WITH I THINK IT ONLY GOOD SOLUTION SO WITH THAT. I APPRECIATE THE GENEROSITY TIME MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I. WILL YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WAS WANT TO ADD THAT BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING SO HARD ON THIS TO. THE LARGER DISCUSSION.

ELEGANT BUT I TO THREE NINE WERE TERM USED. BUT I GUESS I WOULD SAY THE UNDER SECOND GUILT ABOUT ALL THESE NON IS WERE THAT ARE. IRVING PAYING FOR TO YOUR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO BUILD UP ADEQUATE RESERVES ARE A SIX MONTH. EMERGENCY FUND OF MY CONCERN MISTER CHAIR IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS A- NOT A CORE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT SO YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING. NEW AND UNIQUE AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGER SUBJECT THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS A POLICY DRAFTERS DRIFTER GOVERNMENT EXPANSION IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE ALWAYS GET A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT. THERE'S ALSO SOME CONCERN CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS I HAVE AND I'M I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ADDRESSED EARLIER BUT WE ARE IMPAIRING CERTAIN CONTRACTS. AND WITH THAT I'M ALSO UNCOMFORTABLE SO. NOT WANTING TO BE PERHAPS A LOAN AGENT AND GETTING INVOLVED IN IN THAT ROUND- I'M I'M UNCOMFORTABLE THIS TIME THAT I HAVE NO QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORS I JUST WANTED TO. SHARE MY- THOUGHTS IN LESS THAN TWO MINUTES YOUR- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR REALLY APPRECIATIVE I SURE THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT'S GOING TO CENTER NIELSEN OR TO GO TO CENTER TADA. QUESTION THE AUTHOR.

RIGHTS OF THE LANDOWNER THE- DO DOES THIS IN ANY WAY COMPROMISE OR CONSTRAIN THE POLICE OR THE- RENTERS ABILITY TO THE VET. FOUR CARS MEANING FEELING ALLOW ACTIVITIES FIRE HAZARDS THE COLLECTIVE PROPERTY DESTRUCTION POSITION ANYWAY IMPAIR THEIR ABILITY TO INFECT OTHER THAN- THIS WOULD PROHIBIT THAT FOR THE IN THE CASE OF THE COULDN'T PAY BUT THOSE OTHER FACTORS ARE SOMETIMES SIGNIFICANT. ENERGY NIELSEN THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION EXCELLENT QUESTION AND NO IT DOES NOT. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE THAT LET'S GO TO CENTER WINNER THEY WERE TO GO TO CENTER TITLE. FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIMES CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK. ALL THE SENATORS FOR YA AUTHOR IN THE LEADERSHIP FOR WORKING THROUGH THIS- JUST LOOKING NOT BIG PICTURE WE HAVE A HUGE- BREWING- PROBLEM IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND STABILITY FOR RENTERS IN PARTICULAR PARTICULARLY LOWER INCOME. MIDDLE CLASS RENTERS. WHO ARE AT SEVERE RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOUSING AND EVEN THOUGH FOR THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHS OF THE QUARANTINE THE RATES EVERY PAYMENT A PAYMENT OF RENT WERE HIGHER. THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED. THAT IS NOT GOING TO LAST- BECAUSE THE BEGINNING PEOPLE MAY HAVE. MORE SAVINGS SO ON AND SO FORTH- THEY MIGHT BE GETTING A LAST PAYCHECKS FROM BEFORE- THE QUARANTINE STARTED- BUT THE LONGER THIS GOES ON. WE'RE GONNA SEE REAL PROBLEMS AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STARTING TO RE OPEN THE UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL VERY HIGH AND- IT THIS IS A AND THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS TO TRY TO GET BACK UP ON OUR FEET ECONOMICALLY AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF RENTERS WHO ARE. LOSING THEIR HOMES WHO ARE GOING INTO EXTRAORDINARY DIED. BUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOU GET BACK UP ON YOUR FEET ECONOMICALLY SO EVEN THOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE A- TRADITIONAL THING THE GOVERNMENT DOES. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE GENERAL ISSUE IS ONE OF THE STABILIZING THE ECONOMY BECAUSE LIKELY 40% OF CALIFORNIANS RENTS. THIS IS NOT IS A BIG CHUNK. OF OUR ECONOMY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING- FOR HIM WHO ARE WHO ARE WHICH IS WORKERS IN OUR ECONOMY. AND WE HAVE- OBLIGATION AS A LEGISLATURE. BY NOT TO RECESS- IN ORDER AND THEIR SESSION AUGUST THIRTY FIRST WITHOUT HAVING DONE SOME THE SIGNIFICANT THE STABILIZE. ARE RENTERS I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THE VARIOUS BILLS ONE BY SOMEONE RETAIN ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO- TO PROVIDE STRONGER EVICTION PROTECTIONS. YEAH AND I THINK THERE IS SOME GOOD IN THIS BILL IT'S A CREATIVE APPROACH AND I. APPRECIATE THAT IT'S A VOLUNTARY. OFFER THE LANDLORDS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT CAUSES ME. SOME CONCERN BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE FAMILY DOES NOT ENTER INTO IT. THERE ARE SOME PROTECTION EVAN THEIR OBJECTION PROTECTIONS FOR THE TENANTS OF THAT IS A GOOD THING. BUT THE PIECE THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS TODAY I'M GONNA. SUPPORT MOVING IT OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY BUT I WANTED TO. CONVEY IN MY VIEW THE CRITICAL OF IMPORTANCE OF FIXING THE REPAIR A- PORTION OF THE BILL AND THE REPAYMENT PORTION OF THE BILL. NEEDS SIGNIFICANT WORK ON I'M GONNA EXPLAIN WHY- IT IS A TEN YEAR REPAYMENT BY IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS AND AMEND IN ADDITION- IF THERE IS A HARSHA PROVISION. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING IT SLIDING SCALE DEPENDING ON WHAT PERCENT OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME- YOU'RE MAKING- BUT THE WITH THE CHALLENGE IS. TWO FOLD FIRST AS I UNDERSTAND THE WHERE IS THE CREDITS THE TO TAX CREDITS OF THE LANDLORDS RECEIVE. THOSE ARE VESTED THEY HAVE THOSE THEY CAN EXERCISE THOSE CREDITS OVER TEN YEARS AND SELL THEM U FRONT. THAT'S EITHER CASH IN HAND OR GUARANTEE TAX CREDIT OVER TEN YEARS. FOR THE RENTERS WHO ARE GETTING A DISCOUNT OR COMPLETE WAIVER. OF THEIR REPAYMENT. IT IS NOT GUARANTEED AS I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS EFFECTIVELY SUBJECT TO ANNUAL APPROPRIATION TO PAY FOR THOSE TAX CREDITS AND SO IT IS NOT GUARANTEED AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HONOR THAT EVERY YEAR WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS AND IF I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT THEN I ASKED TO BE CORRECTED FROM MY UNDERSTANDING AS IT IS NOT GUARANTEED AND SUBJECT TO ANNUAL APPROPRIATION- AND SO I WOULD I THINK. IT WE'D THERE'S NOTHING THAT I CAN TELL YOU STILL SEE THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM MAKING THESE. EFFECTIVELY VESTED TAX CREDITS THE SAME WAY THAT THE LANDLORDS ARE GETTING THE BEST A TAX FOR THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE BUDGET YEAR BY BUDGET YOUR FUNDED. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE- IN ADDITION. THE REPAYMENT PROCESS IS CLUNKY IT IS NOT A SEAMLESS YOU HAVE TO DO IT I BELIEVE THROUGH YOUR TAX RETURN. SO IF YOU STOP BEING A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE FILE IN CALIFORNIA TAX RETURN IN ORDER TO MAKE THE REPAYMENT OR TO GET THE- DISCOUNTED OR ELIMINATED. PAYMENT AND IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT OTHERWISE FILE TAXES BECAUSE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERN HERE IS FOR LOWEST. INCOME RENTERS WHO DON'T FILE TAX RETURNS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO START FILING TAX RETURNS. IN ORDER TO. SAY I DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY. TO REPAY FOR PUTTING THIS NEW TEN YEAR OBLIGATION ON NUMBER SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T TYPICALLY DO BECAUSE OF POOR THEY DON'T MAKE ENOUGH. TO FILE A TAX RETURN. AND WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT VERY DIVERSE COMMUNITY OF LOW INCOME RENTERS INCLUDING RENTERS WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. INCLUDING RENTERS WHO ARE NOT DOCUMENTED- AND WERE NOW SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO ENTER A SYSTEM THAT YOU NEVER ANSWERED BEFORE. AND NOT JUST ONCE AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE IF YOU'RE POOR CAN'T JUST GO IN AND SAY. I ONLY MAKE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR YOU KNOW I WON A WAIVER. IT TO WAVER YEAR BY YEAR. BECAUSE SOMEONE COULD HAS TO RE AS THE RE UP AND PROVE THEIR INCOME AGAIN EVERY YEAR- AND SO WERE WERE POTENTIALLY FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA RENTERS. PUTTING A VERY ONEROUS OBLIGATION ON- PARTICULARLY IF THEY LEAVE THE STATE AT THIS VERY COMPLICATED- AND WE'RE NOT EVEN GUARANTEEING THAT WE'RE GOING TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS. TO FIND THAT TAX CREDIT. THAT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME IN ANY OTHER CITY I MIGHT BE AGAINST. DOES PART THIS IS BUT I KNOW. THE PEOPLE WHO PUT TOGETHER. HAVE BEEN WORKING EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD FAITH TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO STABILIZE RENTERS. BUT I WANT THAT PROCESS TO SUCCEED I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE. SENATOR HERTZBERG AND BRADFORD COLOR YEREVAN TO PROTECT EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS MADE THIS MOVE FORWARD I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BUT I WANT TO PUT ALL OF THAT OUT THERE IN A VERY BLUNT WAY. SO THAT IN THE ASSEMBLY. MY REQUEST AND HOPE IS THAT THESE CAN WORKED. SO WE END UP. HELPING THESE P. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WIENER IF IT WORKS FOR COMMITTED ANY CONSIDER. A TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY COMMENTS WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR HER TITLE PLEASE ENTER COME HERE YES I JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE AYE AYE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WINNER FOR YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I TOOK COPIOUS NOTES- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE REPLACEMENT. PROCESS IS CLUNKY WE'VE GOT IT WE'VE GOT IT. WORK OUT TO THE MECHANISMS A LOT BETTER AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR- YOUR CONCERN. THERE TO MY% RECOLLECTION THERE'S NO ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS IT THAT YOU'RE REQUIRED I'M NOT SURE WHERE YOU READ THAT. OR WHAT YOU- EXTRAPOLATED INTO IT BUT BUT I'LL GO BACK AND TAE A LOOK AT IT ON IT'S NOT ANTICIPATED THAT IT REQUIRES AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION. THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT THIS THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SET UP. YEAH WE SEE WHAT WE CAN JUST GET CLARITY ON THAT THAT'S WHAT I'D BEEN IMPORTANT TERMS OF WHAT'S IMPLICIT IN THE BELTS ON EXPLICIT. OKAY THE CENTER OF YOUR YOU BEFORE AFTER. CENTER DON'T HAVE SO. THANK SO MUCH IN SENATE. I THINK TO BE TO SAY. LOOK YOU CENTER BRADFORD ALL INVOLVED HAVE REALLY BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. A MECHANISM RIGHT FOR RELIEF. BUT OBVIOUSLY OPEN FOR- ONGOING COMMUNICATION VIA TO GET THIS RIGHT FOR ALL WOULD THAT BE FAIR TO SAY I THINK THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY THE ISSUE IS THAT. ON THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE. IS THE CHALLENGES SENATOR MORLOCK LAID OUT WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE BEFORE. AND QUITE FRANKLY WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT IN A WAY. AS SENATOR HERTZBERG ARTICULATED WHERE WE'RE NOT HAVING A HUGE HIT. ON YOU THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUDGET BY BY DOING THE PROCESS. BUT WE ARE MAKING SURE. THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT ENTERING. A TIME. ONCE THE- THAT EXECUTIVE ORDERS OF THE GOVERNOR HAVE THEY LAPSED. YOU WILL HAVE. POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT- MONEY THAT WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY IT BACK IMMEDIATELY. AND SO IF LANDLORDS START THIS ADDICTION PROCESS. THEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT NO LONGER CAN STAY IN THEIR CURRENT PLACE. LOOKING FOR OTHER PLACES TO STAY WITH LANDLORDS WHO HAVE VACANCIES WHO DON'T WANT THEM BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN EVICTED FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S PLACE AND SO. WE'RE WE'RE REALLY STRUGGLING AND WORKING REALLY HARD TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE PIECES WILL WORK TOGETHER. AND THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE I. THINK YOU A CENTER COVER HERO A CIGARETTE FOR DID YOU WANT TO CHIME IN ON THIS AS WELL NO ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SIR CAREER IT'S GOING TO SENATOR TITLE AND QUICKLY BACK TO CINDER HERTZBERG. SENATOR HER TOWN PLEASE. AB A WANT TO THANK BE. FOR ALL THEIR FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND TRYING TO. SOLVE ISSUE AND THE MATTER AT HAND- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS MUCH LIKE OUR MY COLLEAGUES AND WIENER EXPRESSED ANOTHER'S. BUT I THINK OVERALL WE NEED TO GET SOMETHING DONE WHEN WE AND I THINK THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE VEHICLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR THE FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING A TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS GOING TO CENTER HERTZBERG GONNA BEFORE WE GO TO CENTERS FOR GROUP QUICK CENTER BELL DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS AS WELL OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTERS FOR RESPONSE TO WHAT FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO ISSUES. YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT GIVEN BUT CENTER WE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER TONGUE WAS TALKING ABOUT. IS TO HAVE. SOMEONE IN THE PROCESS WE ACTUALLY IN THE DISCUSSION GROUPS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT. WHERE IF YOU'RE GONNA FOR CLOSE IF SOMEBODY REALLY HAS YOU KNOW LET'S ASSUME. TEN UNITS AND EVERYBODY WHO'S AFFECTED. AT ALL AND THEY'RE GETTING PARTIAL RENT. MAYBE THERE HAS TO BE SOME SHOWING THAT THERE'S NOT SUFFICIENT EQUITY FOR FORECLOSURE SOME PEOPLE OF TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S A SERIES OF PRESSURES. YOU GET THE COMPRESSIONAL TENET. YOU'VE GOT COMPRESSION A LANDLORD. IF YOU GET THE COMPRESSION OF THE BANK IF THERE ARE GETTING THEIR MONEY AND THAT THEY FOR CLOTHES. IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENT EQUITY IN THE PROPERTY AND THEY COULD ACTUALLY RENEGOTIATE MAYBE. WE COULD PUT SOMETHING IN HERE THAT SAYS WHEN SOMEBODY HAS A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THEIR UNITS. SUBJECT TO THESE AGREEMENTS. THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME SHOWING BY THE LANDLORD IN SOME WAYS JUST IT SEEMS TO ME SOME SENSITIVITY THAT MIGHT. AS WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS ARTICULATED HERE. AND SECONDLY THE ON APPROPRIATIONS I JUST SAW THAT THAT WAS ADDED BY AN AMENDMENT. AND I THINK THE PURPOSE OF THAT WAS THE WAY THE BILL READS. IS IT SAYS THEY CAN START USING THE TAX CREDIT TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN. GOING UP FOR TEN YEARS. IF THEY'RE ALL USED IN YEAR ONE. THAT COULD CREATE A PROBLEM IN THE BUDGET I THINK WHAT WAS ASKED HERE PROBABLY TALK TO OUR CONSULTANT HERE. IN THESE AMENDMENTS. THAT THEY WANTED TO BE IN A POSITION JUST IN CASE. THAT WAS TOO MUCH COMPRESSION. AND WE'RE STILL IN THE HOLE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE COULD LESSEN THE BURDEN ON THE STATE. AND EXTEND THE- THOSE TAX CREDITS OUT. AND I MET IF YOU DID THAT IN IN THE LINE. PROBLEM AFFECT THE- IN TERMS WHAT PEOPLE WILLING TO PAY AND DISCOUNT RATES FOR THAT. BUT I DON'T THINK IT REALLY AFFECTS THE- VERY. MORE KIND OF MECHANISM THE STATE. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A- PROBLEM. GOT SOME FLEXIBILITY. IT'S A MUCH SENATOR FISH TED LAYS INJURED COMMITTEE THIS. LAST CALL FROM COMMITTEE LAST CALL COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS ARE. IN QUESTIONS COMMENTS CALL. COMMITTEE CURRENCY NINE MOVE. ON THE FLOOR WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR HERTZBERG EMOTIONS TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS. ORGAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH CENTER CUT YOUR ANSWER BRADFORD TO BE ABLE TO. MAKE A CLOSE- AT WIND CENTER BRADFORD CLOSE AS WE COULD. PRAIRIE DANCES DISINFECTED PODIUM- SECOND HERE PLEASE FOR THE CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR IN THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR A ROBUST DISCUSSION I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS AND THE CONCERNS- MEMBERS THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO NOTHING. WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. THAT WILL PROVIDE THE STATE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOT HAVE TO EXPAND EIGHT RESOURCES THAT WE DON'T HAVE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND KEEP FAMILIES FROM BEING EVICTED AND- MAYBE BECAUSE THEY JUST SIMPLY. CAN'T PAY THE RENT AND DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. TO PROTECT OUR LANDLORDS AS WELL. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT- THEY'RE HURTING AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOOK TODAY. THE CIVIC CENTER COVER ONE MOMENT CENTR BRADFORD AND AGAIN WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. OF THE SERGEANTS FOR GOING THE EXTRA MILE. IN EACH AND EVERY. AND THAT'S TURN IT OVER TO CENTER BRAD PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER AND MEMBERS I TO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DISCUSSION DEBATE HERE ON ONE THING CENTER COVER GIRL FOR HER WORK ON THIS EFFORT. MEMBERS IN A PERFECT WORLD. WE WOULD NEED THIS PROGRAM. IN A PERFECT WORLD THE TENANT AND THE LANDLORD WORK OUT THEIR FINANCIAL DIFF DIFFCULTIES- WITHOUT THE STATE'S INTERVENTION BUT WE ALL KNOW WE'RE IN A CRISIS. WE'RE IN A CRISIS SITUATION AND THAT'S CENTER CAP RURAL HAS STATED IT WOULD BE CRIMINAL OUR PARTS THE NOT TO INTERVENE AND DO SOMETHING IF WE CAN. IS THIS THE PERFECT BILL BY NO STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION HAS IT BUT IT'S MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE BUT TELL ME WHAT SCENARIO. WITH A TENANT BUILD THE STATE IN ANYONE'S PROPERTY. FOR SIX MONTHS WITHOUT PAYING RENT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE PUT THE MECHANISMS BACK THE TENTATIVE STILL REPORT REQUIRED TO MAKE SOME KIND OF. PAYMENT AND NOT BE TOTALLY IS ALL FROM THEIR MONTHLY OBLIGATION HERE SO THE TENANT HOUSE SKIN IN THE GAME AS WELL BUT AT THE SAME TIME EIGHT TEN IT NOT PAYING RENT. LEAVE THE LANDLORD IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING THAT PROPERTY. AND THAT'S JUST AS BAD BECAUSE AGAIN AT THE LANDLORD FOR CLOSER THE ONLY DOES THAT CREATE FINANCIAL RUIN FOR THE LANDLORD BUT IT ALSO AFFECTS THE TENANT. SO WE'RE TRYING TO THREAT THAT NEEDLE CAN COME UP WITH A PROGRAM THAT LOOKS OUT. AT BOTH PARTIES. THIS PROCESS TRIES TO DO THIS. OUR IF NOT BOTH OF THEM LOOSE IN THIS SCENARIO- AGAIN THE TAX CREDITS ARE. AVAILABLE TO THOSE LANDLORDS WHO CHOOSE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM IT'S NOT FORCED UPON ANYONE TO PARTICIPATE WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE WHAT BUT THIS WOULD BE AN INCENTIVE FOR A TENANT HI I BELIEVE IF YOU HAD TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE IN PAYING BACK THE RENT. VERSUS TOLLEY ABSOLVING THEM OF THEIR OBLIGATION AND THEM BEING THE VICTIM YOU HAVE A FOUR MONTH PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIX SOMEBODY UNLAWFUL DETAINER THAT'S GOING TO COST A LOT MORE MONEY SO THAT HAVE SOME ASSURANCES AND GUARANTEES TO THESE TAX CREDITS THAT THE LANDLORD WILL BE MAYBE NOT A SENAORS BURKE STATED NINETY PERCENT. IS BETTER THAN NOTHING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO PASS FROM THE DUKE AGAIN. SOMEONE MENTIONED THE FACT THAT YOU CAN JUST. PARTICIPATING IS PROGRAMMING TOTALLY AVOID RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE TO QUALIFY YOU HAVE TO SHOW A NEED FOR THIS PROGRAM YOU JUST CAN'T SAY I'M NOT GONNA PAY MY RENT. AND BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM WE'RE GONNA I'M GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND JUST SIT AND MARK APARTMENT FOR SIX MONTHS NOW. YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS A FINANCIAL NEED ON YOUR PART TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BUT AGAIN. YOU'RE EXPECTED TO MAKE SOME PORTION OF THAT RIGHT WHETHER IT'S ON YOUR DOLLARS A MONTH WITH ITS FIVE WHEN IT ALL THE MONTH YOU STILL HAVE SOME OBLIGATION. TO LIVE UP TO THAT AND TRY TO KEEP THAT LANDLORD WHOLE SO. CENTER CALVET IT COVER YEAR WHEN I. WILL CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION ON THIS MATTER HOW WE KNOW THE NEED TO BRING BOTH SIDES TOGETHER AS WE MOVE FOR. AND ON THAT NOTE IT'S RESPECTFULLY.
