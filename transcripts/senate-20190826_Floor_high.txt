A FEW MONTHS BACK TO COME HOME WITH THE WITH THE FALLEN IN THE CASKET. IN A COMPANY THAT CASKET ALL THE WAY HOME. NOT ONLY THAT HE WAS ASSIGNED TO THE FAMILY TO BE THERE WITH THEM AS A FELLOW CAPTAIN A FELLOW GREEN BERET AND HIS JOB OVER THE LAST FOUR MONTHS BEFORE HE WENT BACK TO HIS DUTY STATION WITH THE BE WITH THE FAMILY EACH AND EVERY SINGLE DAY.

AND THIS CONCURRENT RESOLUTION RAISES AWARENESS ABOUT A DEADLY DISEASE THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS COMMONLY NOT DETECTED UNTIL THE WOMAN WHO HAS IT IS IN STAGE FOR THREE OR FOUR WHICH OFTEN I. CREATES A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE OUTCOME IS NOT GOOD AND THE TREATMENTS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. MY OWN SISTER WHO WAS A VETERINARIAN SO WAS NOT DEVOID OF MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE WAS EXPERIENCING A VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS THAT ONE IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A CLEAR SET OF OVARIAN CANCER SYMPTOMS SHE WAS HAVING THINGS THAT HER DOCTOR THOUGHT WERE PERHAPS RELATED TO DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS OR ANY OTHER NUMBER OF THINGS AND SHE HAD BEEN GOING TO A DOCTOR TO DEAL WITH THOSE SYMPTOMS FOR OVER A YEAR BEFORE SHE WAS PROPERLY TESTED AND FOUND TO HAVE A VERY AND CANCER BUT FR WHICH WAS ALREADY STAGE FOUR. SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO HAVE ALL WOMEN AWARE OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO DO BETTER DETECTION ON BECAUSE WE HAVE ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND WOMEN A YEAR IN THE US THE DIE FROM THIS DISEASE AND WHEN IT IS DETECTED EARLIER THE CHANCES FOR RECOVERY ARE FAR GREATER SO I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN VOTING YES.

THAT PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE. WOMEN ARE CRITICAL TO IS STRONG AND VIBRANT CALIFORNIA AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT UNTIL WE CLOSE THE GAPS. IN EDUCATION THE WORKPLACE AND ACHIEVE FAIR PAY AN EQUAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES. LET THIS SERVE AS A CELEBRATION OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME AND SERVE AS A REMINDER THAT WE MUST CONTINUE THE FIGHT UNTIL WE'RE TRULY EQUAL. I APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES ALL OF THE WOMEN THAT WORK. WITH ME EVERY TODAY WEARING WHITE AND I ALSO. A MALE COLLEAGUES FOR ALSO JOINING IN THIS AS WELL AND WEARING WHITE TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR SENATOR JACKSON'S. YES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS MY JEWISH COLLEAGUE. COLLEAGUES RECOGNIZED WAS PROBABLY SMART TO HAVE THEIR- BOBBY. THE JEWISH GRANDMOTHER SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THEY'RE VERY SMART GROUP AND OF COURSE. THEY KNOW WHICH SIDE THEIR MUCH HAS BROUGHT THE BUTTERED ON. SO I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN COMMEMORATION OF WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY THIS IS THE NINETY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RATIFICATION OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT AND THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR WE WILL BE CELEBRATING NOTING ACKNOWLEDGING AND FIGHTING. TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO GAIN EQUALITY FOR WOMEN PERHAPS EVEN THIS YEAR WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PASSING THE BALL RIGHTS AMENDMENTS WE ARE FRANKLY ONE STATE AWAY. I IT IS OUR HOPE THAT UP. WE SEE LEVELS OF A QUALITY AS WERE MENTIONED BY MY GOOD COLLEAGUE AND SEAT MATE WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND I THINK YOU NOTED THAT FOR THE FIVE SCIENTISTS THE DOCTOR TO. MEMBERS SO FAR SENATE A INTERN PROGRAM WERE WOMEN WE ARE SEEING MORE MORE WOMEN ENTERING THE WORKFORCE AND HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVELS AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS APPROPRIATELY RECOGNIZED AND GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THIS IMPORTANT DATE I DOUBT MANY OF YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF JEWISH WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES TO. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY OBJECTED TO THEIR EXCLUSION FROM THE FRANCHISE AND WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE SOME NOISE ABOUT IT. WE ARE NOT A PLACID DEMOGRAPHIC AFTER ALL. THE ONE MOVEMENT FOR WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE WAS INTERNATIONALLY JEWISH WOMEN WERE RIGHT THERE. FOUNDED IN NINETEEN TWELVE FOR EXAMPLE THE JEWISH LEAGUE FOR WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE FOUGHT FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO VOTE IN ENGLAND. RECEIVE HER SCHWIMMER ORGANIZED THE HUNGARIAN FEMINIST ASSOCIATION WHICH HELPED ACHIEVE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE AND HUNGRY IN NINETEEN TWENTY. ROSA MANOS WAS ACTIVE IN THE DUTCH BRANCH OF THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE ALLIANCE AND BERTHA SOLOMON HELP WOMEN OBTAIN THE VOTE IN SOUTH AFRICA IN NINETEEN THIRTY. AND THE STORY OF THE RATIFICATION OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES ALSO HAS A JEWISH TWIST TO IT. CONGRESS PASSED THE AMENDMENT TO NINETEEN NINETEEN. AND BY THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE STATES HAD RATIFIED THE AMENDMENT ONE MORE WAS NEEDED TO REACH THE THREE QUARTER THE THREE FOURTHS VOTE REQUIREMENT. FOR THE CONSTITUTION. EIGHT STATES HAD WRITTEN TO THE AMENDMENT AND FIVE HAD NOT VOTE. PROPONENTS SAW TENNESSEE. AS THE BEST BET TO BE THE STATE TO PUT THE AMENDMENT OVER THE TOP. NOW THE TEN TENNESSEE SENATE EASILY PASSED THE AMENDMENT BUT IT WAS DEADLOCKED IN THE HOUSE. HARRY T. BURN THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF THE TENNESSEE HOUSE HAD VOTED TO TABLE THE RESOLUTION AND THEN AT LEAST SO THE LEGEND GOES. A JEWISH SUFFRAGETTE I NEED A PULITZER WHO THEN WOULD GO ON TO BE FOLK SINGER PETE SEEGER SAUNTERED AYE SEVEN FIGURE OUT HOW THAT. HAPPENED BUT WAS AT ONE POINT PETE SEEGER'S ON'T. ARE CONVINCED HIM TO CHANGE HIS VOTE WE DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT SHE THREATENED HIM WITH BUT APPARENTLY IT WAS EFFECTIVE AND HE DID INDEED CHANGES VOTE. BUT AS NOTED WE STILL HAVEN'T ACHIEVED EQUALITY WE ARE STILL FIGHTING HARD FOR IT WE ARE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS AND THINGS ARE HAPPENING FROM EQUAL PAY TO WOMEN ON CORPORATE BOARDS TO ALL SORTS OF THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO GIVE WOMEN. THE SAME OPPORTUNITY BUT WHEN WILL WE ACHIEVE QUALITY ARE GOOD JEWISH COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND AND VETERANS GROUP BETTER GINSBURG WAS PASSED. HER RESPONSE WAS SIMPLE. WHEN THERE ARE. NINE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATE JACKSON WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO GO TO CENTER DRAWS AND IN TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR CHAIN CENTER DR. THANK YOU. ON WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY WE CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH GAVE MOST WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT WAS RATIFIED NINETEEN TWENTY AND WAS MERRIN TO GUARANTEE ALL WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. BUT WOMEN OF COLOR WHO FOUGHT AND ADVOCATED FOR THAT GUARANTEE WE'RE NOT FULLY GRANTED THAT RIGHT UNTIL NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. TODAY WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY IS MUCH MORE A SYMBOL OF WOMEN'S CONTINUED FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS. EQUALITY CAN'T WAIT. AND THE PROGRESS THAT WE ARE MAKING AND I WOULD SAY IS NOT GREAT PROGRESS. I AM VERY PROUD OF OUR FIGHT. TO REACH EQUALITY BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT WE DON'T MAKE ENOUGH PROGRESS EVERY SINGLE DAY THANK YOU AND I SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU MAN CENTER CENTER CHIANG THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S. C. R. FIFTY SIX AS CO CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE API CAUCUS. TO HONOR AND COMMEMORATE THE FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S EQUALITY IN AMERICA CELEBRATING THE NINETY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RATIFICATION OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT IS AN IMPORTANT REMINDER OF HOW MUCH WORK WE STILL HAVE TO DO. AS THE SOLE ASIAN AMERICAN FEMALE MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE I CAN ATTEST TO THIS. AND ALSO GIVEN MY OWN CRAZY EXPERIENCES. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO DOUBLE STANDARDS AND TRULY QUALITY I MEAN I EXPERIENCES EVERY DAY AS I'M SURE ALL OF YOU. DO AS WELL. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WOMEN MAKE UP 50% OF THE POPULATION BUT ONLY MAKE UP 30% OF THE LEGISLATURE. DESPITE THE NUMBERS WE HAVE MADE A GREAT IMPACT ON POLICIES THAT IMPACT WOMEN CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE MORE WOMEN WE SEE ELECTED OFFICE THE MORE YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ARE REMINDED THAT THEY MAY ONE DAY SERVE IN ELECTED OFFICE. REGARDLESS OF PARTISAN POLITICS WHICH ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT WOMEN WHO HAVE A DESIRE TO BE THE CHANGE THEY WANT TO SEE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND RECOGNIZING TODAY AS WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY LET US TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON THE FIGHT THAT IT HAS TAKEN TO GET HERE AND TAKE NOTE OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. THANK YOU.

CENTER JACKSON THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I APPRECIATE THE INDULGENCE OF THE BODY TO ALLOW ME TO PRESENT. OF HOPEFULLY THREE ITEMS THAT ARE FAIRLY BRIEF. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB EIGHTEEN EXCUSE ME EIGHT HUNDRED WHICH IS A BILL TO ALLOW PARTICIPANTS. IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S SAFE AT HOME PROGRAM. THE FILE COURT DOCUMENTS AS JANE OR JOHN DOE. THE SAFE AT HOME PROGRAM ALLOWS VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STALKING AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. TO USE THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S ADDRESS ON THEIR PUBLIC RECORDS IN ORDER TO PREVENT POTENTIAL ASSAILANTS FROM FINDING THEM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEASURE IS TO ALLOW PROGRAMPARTICIPANTS TO PROTECT THEIR CONFIDENTIALITY WALL FILING COURT MATTERS WITHOUT FEAR THEIR PARTICIPATION WILL RESULT IN THE PARTICIPANTS THEIR PARTICIPANTS NAME APPEARING ON A PUBLIC COURT RECORDS. AND THUS REVEALING THEIR WHEREABOUTS THE AUTHORS WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THE WORKABILITY QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED AND IS CRAFTED THIS BILL IT'S NOW A NARROWLY TAILORED BILL WITH THIS WHICH WILL EXTEND THE SAFETY NET. OF PRIVACY OFFERED IN THE SAFE AT HOME PROGRAM AND GIVE PARTICIPANTS BACK THE RIGHT SO MANY OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED WHICH IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT.

CENTER MORLOCK GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MR PRESIDENT JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE. FLOOR MANAGER SENATE JACKSON WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION. SHE WILL CENTER MORE LIKE PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT TAP. THERE ARE SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE'RE REQUESTING AMENDMENTS AS SO I'M JUST CURIOUS FOR THOSE AMENDMENTS ACCEPTED I BELIEVE ALL THE AMENDMENTS WERE ACCEPTED THEY WERE I KNOW THAT THE LAND TITLE COMPANIES HAD CONCERNS WE'VE TRIED TO NARAL THOSE DOWN. WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION BUT WE HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN AS CLOSELY AS WE CAN TO AVOID AGAIN THIS INFORMATION WHEN ON AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN STALKED OR HARASSED OR THE VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. NEEDS ARE FOR HERSELF OR HIMSELF TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO COURT TO REDRESS WHATEVER GRIEVANCE OR CERTAIN THEY HAVE THE IS THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD THEN HAVE USED THEIR OWN IT. ALLOWS THEM TO BE SEARCHED AND INFORMATION TO BE GLEANED BY THAT STALKER SO WE HAVE TRIED TO EXPAND AND PROTECT. THEIR NAMES BY NARROWING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THEY CAN DO THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY IF I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY THAT AT SOME POINT THAT NAME THAT INFORMATION COULD BE KNOWN BUT NOT IN THE PRELIMINARY ASPECTS OF A PROCEEDING WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL COULD JUST SIMPLY GO ONLINE AND FIND THE NAME OF THE PERSON THAT THEY ARE STOCKING. BUT THE ESCROW ASSOCIATION IS STILL OPPOSED. UNLESS AMENDED LET ME CHECK HERE. I BELIEVE THAT MIGHT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THE JUDGES ASSOCIATION AND TRADITIONAL COUNCIL WERE BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS BEING DONE IN THE BILL IN THE USE OF PSEUDONYMS WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS AND WOULD NOT BE WORKING THE BILL SO I SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE TECHNICALLY OPPOSED BUT UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE SORT OF IN A BIT OF A CONUNDRUM HERE. BUT THEY'RE NOT WORKING ACTIVELY IT TO OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH I THINK IT'S MORE LOCKED. IN THE CENTER JACKSON MEMBERS IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. CENTER MORALE. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR WELL GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU GOOD TO SEE. A ONE QUICK QUESTION BEFORE MANY THIRD CENTER JACKSON WOULD YOU ACCEPT YEAH I JUST WANT TO HAVE IT REPAIRED AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CENTER WITHOUT WITHOUT. CONCERN YEAH I JUST CLARITY ON THE TITLE HE HAD ASKED THAT QUESTION BUT I WASN'T SURE OF THE TITLE. IN THE US WILL COMPANY HAD REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION JUST DUE TO THE FACT THAT YEARS OF MY LIFE BACK THIRTY PLUS YEARS AGO. I WAS IN THE TITLE BUSINESS AND I KNOW HOW THAT CAN REALLY MESS UP RECORDINGS AND- IF PEOPLE GO TO SELL THEIR HOME. IT IT IT IT IT'S KIND OF AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE DOWN THE LINE BUT DID THEY REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY HAVE BUT I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY WORK WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN THE JUDGES ASSOCIATION. AND THEN. WE CAME OR THEY CAME AS CLOSE AS THEY COULD. WHICH IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO QUITE GET THERE I KNOW THAT THE TITLE OFFICERS WANTED. ALL COURT ORDERS TO BE PUBLICLY ISSUED. A AND THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS OKAY THANK YOU YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH GENERAL. BUT IS ANGELA SENATE ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. XENON WE LIKE TO HAVE CENTER JACKSON CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CAN'T QUITE GET TO WHERE YOU HAVE EVERYBODY IN SAYING THIS BILL GETS AS CLOSE AS IT CAN RECOGNIZING. THE CONCERNS THAT EXIST IN A COURT PROCEEDING BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING VICTIMS OF THESE ARE. TIMES WHETHER IT'S HUMAN TRAFFICKING OR WHAT HAVE YOU SO THAT THEY ARE. ABLE TO SEEKREDRESS WHEN THEY NEED TO GO TO COURT WITHOUT FEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE STALKED BY THEIR- ABUSER AND THIS IS OF COURSE AS WE KNOW A SERIOUS PROBLEM. WE'VE NARROWED THE BILL'S BEEN KNOWER TO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE A WHILE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THOSE INNOCENT FOLKS WHO ARE BEING STALKED. HARASSED ABUSED AND PHYSICALLY THREATENED BY A PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY CAN'T STOP MISBEHAVING SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR INFO THANK YOU SENATOR MISTER SPECTER.
