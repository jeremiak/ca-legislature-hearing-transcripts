OF THE SENATE GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. BUT I I GOTTA TELL YOU ARE MAKING A STATEMENT LIKE THAT HAVING A BUNCH OF MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM DO WHAT I SAY IS PRETTY AMAZING. BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU AND WELCOME USED TO THE JOIN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE CALIFORNIA MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING OUR CHAIRWOMAN OF JACKSON HER STAFF FROM THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. FOR HELPING US ORGANIZE THIS HEARING. IN FOR THE WORK THAT YOUR COMMITTEE IS DONE IN RESPONSE TO THE DEVASTATING FIRES. THAT CALIFORNIA FACE THIS PAST YEAR. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRE SEASON WAS ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED. THE STATE WITNESS NEARLY NINE THOUSAND WILD FIRES WHICH BURNED AT ONE POINT TWO MILLION ACRES DESTROYED NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES IN RESULTED IN THE UNFORTUNATE DEATH OF AT LEAST. FORTY SIX INDIVIDUALS. ADDITIONALLY A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE FIVE OF THIS MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN RECORDED HISTORY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WILDFIRES ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE. AS WILDFIRES INVOLVED SOME US BE OUR WAY OF RESPONDING. WHILE CALIFORNIA'S MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS WORLD RENOWNED. IT APPEARS THAT IT'S QUITE STRAINED AND THAT'S IMPROVEMENTS DO NEED TO BE MADE. BEFORE I BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PERSONALLY THANK OUR FIRST RESPONDERS RECOVERY WORKERS VOLUNTEERS IN EVERY SINGLE PERSON ACROSS CALIFORNIA BEYOND. WHO CAME TO OUR HELP WHEN WE WERE MOST IN NEED? DURING OUR DARKEST HOUR THE SPIRIT OF CALIFORNIA. NEVER FALTERED. IN FACT IT ONLY GREW STRONGER. IT IS WITH THAT SPIRIT THAT WE MUST RECOVER REBUILD. AND PREPARE. THANK YOU ADVANCE TO ALL THE PANELISTS. ALSO WAS YOU COULD I CAN SEE WE HAVE A FULL AGENDA. SO I URGE EACH OF YOU TO. KEEP YOUR. TESTIMONY AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE. CHAIRWOMAN JACKSON. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS AT THIS POINT ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO NOTE OFF THE SO. WONDERFUL MEN IN UNIFORM. WE DON'T SEE ANY WONDERFUL WOMEN IN UNIFORM PERHAPS OUR NEXT GO ROUND WILL BE. WELL REPRESENTED BY THE OTHER FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WHO I KNOW IN MANY INSTANCES. WERE VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVED. IN THE FIGHTING OF THESE FIRES AND APPRECIATE. THE GREAT WORK THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE DONE. I KNOW CHIEF LORENZEN SMILING BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME HE'S HEARD ME. OBSERVE WE NEED MORE WOMEN. TO BE PART OF THIS ILLUSTRIOUS GROUP. OF. EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE AND I DO THANK YOU ALL FOR FOR THAT EFFORT AND TALKED ONE ALSO THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. I RECALL BACK IN OCTOBER. OVER FOR EARLY NOVEMBER WHEN I CAME UP TO VIEW THE WILDFIRES. CARNAGE THAT HAD BEEN CREATED UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT WAS. MIND BLOWING IS I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO DESCRIBE THAT THE DEVASTATION. I HADN'T NOT TO. REALIZE AT THE TIME THAT I WOULD TO BE EXPERIENCING A VERY SIMILAR. TRAGEDY IN MY OWN DISTRICT WHICH IS A REFLECTION FRANKLY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOW A. TWELVE MONTH THE YEAR FIRE SEASON. THAT THE FIRES ARE MORE INTENSE MORE EXPANSIVE MORE DESTRUCTIVE. AND MORE PREVALENT THROUGHOUT OUR STATE SO I THANK YOU FOR. PUTTING THIS TOGETHER TO. DISCUSS OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN AS CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. WE'RE GETTING BUSIER AND BUSIER. AS WE SEE CLIMATE CHANGE HAVING ITS IMPACTS ON CALIFORNIA ON OUR COMMUNITIES ON OUR POPULATION. AND ON OUR RESOURCES WHICH YOU SO ABLY HAVE REPRESENTED. WE DO HAVE I THINK THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MUTUAL AID SYSTEM UP PROBABLY IN THE WORLD AN INFECTED DURING THE THOMAS FIRE. I RECALL SEEING A OF THE FIRE OF PERSONAL FROM AUSTRALIA. AS WELL AS PROBABLY BY TWENTY ONE OTHER STATES WHO CAME TO THE AID OF US IN. IN BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUT WHEN WE NEEDED IT MOST BUT. WITH RESPECT TO THE THOMAS FIRE WE NEEDED IT IN DECEMBER NOT A TIME WHEN WE ARE NORMALLY EXPECTING OR PREPARED FOR THOSE KINDS OF INCIDENTS SO. I THINK THIS IS A VERY TIMELY. DISCUSSION AND. BY HAVING LIVED THROUGH THE THE THOMAS FIRE AND THE SUBSEQUENT MUD FLOWS THE MUD DEBRIS WHICH TOOK TWENTY THREE LIVES TO OF WHICH WE'VE YET TO FIND. I IT IT IS A SOMBER. OF MOMENTS BUT ONE OF GREAT APPRECIATION FOR THE HARD WORK OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND THOSE WHO HAVE. A BROAD TO A TOGETHER THE FINEST THAT WE HAVE AYE AND DEMONSTRATED HOW GOVERNMENT AT ITS BEST A REALLY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO. WITH THAT I WANT TO. TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS I LOOK FORWARD TO A TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE WHO. SUFFERED AS WELL DURING THOSE. FIRES IN OCTOBER THERE IS MUCH TO LEARN AND GIVEN THAT THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT IS THE PROTECTION OF ITS PEOPLE. HEARINGS LIKE THIS BECOME EVEN MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORK. UP TO THE DISCUSSION HAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO. INTRODUCE. THE SENATOR FROM. SO MY COUNTY. SPECIFICALLY HAVING. YOU'RE MEANT TO SEE NO SNOW MCCOWN IN HIS DISTRICT SANTA WAS CITY OF SANTA ROSA. WHO HAS REALLY DONE AN AMAZING JOB WORKING? YOU KNOW WITH THE TEAM AND ALSO WITH HIS. CONSTITUENTS CENTER MICHAEL ARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT CHURCH DOT NINETY ONE. SAY THANK YOU INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIP AND AND SENATOR DODD HAS BEEN WORKING OVERTIME OVER THESE PAST NEARLY SIX MONTHS. BUT SINCE THE FIRES BROKE OUT IN THE FOR NORTH BE COUNTY REGION UNTS ONCE HE THINK YOU. INCREDIBLE WORKING FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS ON ISSUES MUTUAL AID ALONG WITH CHAIRWOMAN JACKSON. UP FOR OLIVER INCREDIBLE WORK. IN SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTY AREAS IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. I'LL BE VERY QUICK NOW AND I THINK WILL ECHO WHAT BOTH SIDES CHAIRWOMAN TERMINATE SAID. IS THAT CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A MODEL A WHEN IT COMES FOR ME TOO LATE SYSTEM. BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR BUT THE SYSTEM IS STRAINED THAT WE MUST ENHANCE FINDING AND MODERNIZE PA THIS WORLD RENOWNED SYSTEM. AND THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES. AT THE LOCAL OR STATE LEVELS TO MOVE EQUIPMENT AND STAFF AT OUR GREATEST TIMES OF NEED. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SIX THOUSAND REQUESTS FOR MUTUALLY. ELEVEN THOUSAND OR THIRTY ONE PERCENT WENT UNFILLED. IT'S SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THIS ERA OF NEW NORMAL. BUT IN THESE UNANSWERED CALLS HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. WITHIN THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS OF THE NORTH BAY. FIRESTORM BREAKING OUT OVER THREE HUNDRED MUTUAL AID INCHEON'S REQUESTED TO JOIN THE FIGHT. BUT ONLY A HUNDRED THIRTY ENGINES PERSON IN THOSE FIRST TWELVE HOURS. THAT'S THERE'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH CAPACITY WITHIN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. BUT MISTER CHAIR ALL WRAPPED UP SAMENESS. I BELIEVE A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM REQUIRES AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILLION MORE ANNUALLY IN ORDER TO HANDLE THE INCREASINGLY BURDENSOME STRAIN FIRST RESPONDERS ARE UNDER IN CALIFORNIA'S NEW NORMAL. WHILE HUNDRED MILLION MAY BE A LOT TO INVEST IT'S MUCH LESS THAN THE NEARLY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION IN INSURED LOSSES THAT ARE BEING PAID OUT. IN THE FOR NORTH BAY COUNTY REGION. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE DOZENS OF LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. FORTY FOUR. FORTY FOR THE NORTH BAY REGION. AND IS ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE CHAIR ITS CHAIRWOMAN FOR ALL YOUR CREDIBLE WORKING GRATEFUL TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR IDEA BACK TO. CENTER JACKSON DUH Y. MIGHT SEEM WOMEN. IN IN UNIFORM HERE TODAY. ADO Y. FOR THE RECORD TO KNOW THAT MY DISTRICT THREE. WOMAN OF THE YEAR IS NONE OTHER THAN UNIT SHE FOR CAL FIRE SHANA JONES WHO DID SUCH A FANTASTIC JOB. LEADING TROOPS. YEAH THROUGHOUT. THEN THE NORTH BAY FIRE SO WHAT. WE ARE RECOGNIZING WOMEN THERE DO SUCH A GREAT JOB FOR US HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE. FIRST PANEL PLEASE. I IT'S AN OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND I. I CAN'T THINK OF TWO BETTER A PEOPLE TO BE IN THIS PANEL THEN. MARK YOUR DUTY DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE AND CAMPAIGN WHAT DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE. IT FOR THE RECORD IT'S IT IT'S AMAZING I KNEW BOTH OF THESE GENTLEMEN BEFORE BUT I. HAD NO IDEA HOW WELL. WE WOULD GET TO KNOW THESE. AB MEMBERS OF ALL OUR PANEL SUITOR COMING UP HERE TODAY SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT SERVICE NEAR GREAT WORK ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE ON I IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DON. THE WOMAN JACKSON GREAT SEE THIS MORNING. OVER THE COMMITTEE. SENATE MCGUIRE BE CF NOW BUT WELL OF FIRST LET ME JUST SAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD THIS HEARING AND GIVE US. SOME TIME TO TALK ABOUT. REALLY WHAT IS. WANNA CALIFORNIA'S. ON GOLDEN RESOURCES AND THAT'S THAT THEM THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. YOU KNOW OUR OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM GETS UTILIZED A LOT IN AND IT REALLY DOES ENCOMPASS. NOT JUST FIRE ALL THE WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON FIRE TODAY BUT REALLY ARE MUTUALLY SYSTEM. IS IS AN ALL HAZARD. CAPABILITY THAT ADDRESSES. NOT JUST FIRE AND RESCUE BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL. ON AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. WE UTILIZE THIS SYSTEM PRETTY MUCH EVERY SINGLE DAY IN CALIFORNIA. ON ONE KIND OF EVENT OR NEITHER ON IT AT SOME LEVEL AND WHILE. RESPONSIBILITY IN. INSURING FOR THAT THAT THAT THE COORDINATION OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN THE MANAGEMENT. WE COULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT AGRI PARTNERS. AT THE STATE LEVEL IN THIS. BUT I CALL A ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT EFFORT OF CERTAINLY. ON MY PARTNER CHIEF PAM Y.. AND DATA AND CAL FIRE. HIGH THEY ARE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL AND THAT ARE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD HOW FROM THE STANDPOINT OF BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS. BUT AS WE MOVE DOWN THROUGH. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS SYSTEM IS REALLY OPERATIONAL BECAUSE OF. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IT IS REALLY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SYSTEM TO UTILIZE TO. TO INSURE FOR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED ARE WHEN THEY NEED THEM AND OUT IT IS FLEXIBLE AND IT IS UP. IT IS. EXPANDABLE GOT TO MEET ANY KIND OF EVENT. ARE THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT WE USE THAT THE SMALLEST ADVANCE. WE'VE USE IT PLANNED EVENTS LIKE THE OLYMPICS AND OTHER KINDS OF THE SUPERBOWL. ABA WE'VE ALSO USE THAT AT A MAJOR EVENTS LIKE UP LIKE THE FIRES WE'VE JUST HAD. BOB IT'S IMPORTANT NOTICES A BIT OF A BACKGROUND THAT. THE FIRE AND RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS AS OUTLINED IN A PLAN OF FIRE RESCUE MERGE THE MITCHELL A PLAN. THAT PLANS A COMPONENT OF WHAT WE CALL THE MASTER MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT. BASS MUTUALLY AGREEMENT IS A AGREEMENT THAT SIGNED BY BY THE JURISDICTIONS OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN MOST EVERY. I CITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALL EVERY STATE AGENCY ARE AND IT TALKS ABOUT. REALLY THE PREMISE IS NEIGHBOR HELPING NEIGHBOR Y. JURISDICTION PROVIDING RESOURCES TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION. AT TIME OF NEED AND IT'S DONE SO OUT IN A VERY SYSTEMATIC INC AND AND STANDARDIZED IN COORDINATED. IT WAS ALSO THE BASIS OF FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CALIFORNIA AND ITS. AS A STATE IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT ACTUALLY HAS AS THE ENTERPRISE THAT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THAT SYSTEM WAS THE BASSIST THAT THAT BECAME THE UP THE NATIONAL INCIDENT MEANS RESISTED THAT NOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ALL STATES USE ON. THE BILL THAT MASS MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT FIRST ADOPTED IN NINETEEN FIFTY HAS CONTINUED TO PROVIDE. ALL FOR US BUT WE KNOW. AS SENATE MCGUIRE SAY THAT EACH AND EVERY TIME WE LEARN BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT. ARE MODERNIZING THE SYSTEM AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THIS SYSTEM. AS I MENTIONED IS ALL HAZARDS. IT'S PREDICATED ON ON LEVERAGING. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LOCAL ELECTED BODIES ABILITY TO DECLARE LOCAL EMERGENCIES ARE THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE ABILITY TO PROCLAIM A STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND OR A UTILIZING THE PRESIDENT DECLARES A PRESIDENTIAL. BUT THE PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY. R. IT ALSO SPEAKS TO CASES I GOT FOR BED OF THE STATE OF WAR ALL BUT ALSO FOR TERRORISM RELATED TODD TYPES OF ACTIVITY SO SECURITY. THREATS THAT THE STATE AND ALL OF THAT IS THE FIND ARE IN WHAT WE HAVE IN STATUETTE CALLED EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT. HOW DOES THIS WORK SO THE THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED IS THAT? WHEN. EVENTS EXCEED IN JURISDICTIONS CAPABILITIES. THAT THAT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM CAN BE LEVERAGED TO ASCERTAIN THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED. AND IT'S VERY FOCUSED ON THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THAT JURISDICTION TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE WHATEVER CASE THEY'RE DEALING WITH ARE IF BIG IF THE IF THE EVENTS BECOME MORE COMPLICATED IN SIZE AND SCOPE AND SCALE. THEN. OR THE EVENTS REQUIRE INVOLVE MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS THAT CYST THAT MUTUALLY SYSTEM IS ALLOWED TO EXPAND AND. AND THOSE THOSE RESOURCES ARE OBTAINED. THROUGH. A SERIES OF OF A STANDARD ICE PROCESS HE STARTING AT THE LOCAL. CITY LEVEL. OUGHT TO A. WHAT WE CALL AN OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATOR IT SET COUNTY COORDINATOR TYPICALLY A LOCAL FIRE CHIEF? BUT. I THINK COULD BE SOMEWHAT LIKE AN INCREASE TO CAL FIRE SOMETIMES OPERATES THAT IN THE INS IN THE IN THE UP AND UP. REPRESENTING LOCAL FIRE AND THEN IT GOES UP INTO A REGIONAL. WHICH IS MULTIPLE COUNTIES ALL WERE REGIONAL COORDINATORS THEN I CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE RESOURCES THAT ARE BETTER SITTING WITHIN. A REGION SO THE THE. THE OPERATIONAL AREA OR THE COUNTY COORDINATOR IS LOOKING AT RESOURCES THAT EXIST IN ALL THE CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY. AND THE REGIONAL COORDINATOR IS LOOKING AT ALL THE RESOURCES THAT ARE WITHIN. A MULTIPLE COUNTIES WITHIN A REGION AND THEN OF COURSE IF IT STILL. NEEDED SPECIALIZED RESOURCES OR THE SITUATION IS SO COMPLEX IT COMES UP TO. A STATE WE ASK HEADQUARTERS WHERE WE LOOK AT IT FROM A STATEWIDE BASIS LOOKING AT EVERY JURISDICTION IN CALIFORNIA AND BEING ABLE TO LITERALLY TAPI AND. TO ALL JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT ALL OF THOSE RESOURCES FROM THAT. CALIFORNIA MEXICAN BORDER TO THE CALIFORNIA OREGON BORDER ARE AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM AND ALL OF THEM CAN BE. PROVIDED TO A LOCAL FIRE CHIEF IN THIS CONTEXT TO SUPPORT BAD INCIDENT SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT A FIRE CHIEF WITHOUT FIRE DEPARTMENT OF. THREE OR FOUR STATIONS AND YOU KNOW EIGHTY FIREFIGHTERS LITERALLY CAN HAVE ON HIS BACK STEPS ALL WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS HUNDREDS OF FIREFIGHTERS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF FIREFIGHTERS. BAD TO BE ABLE TO. THE LEVERAGE THAT CAPABILITY. AND. AND THEN THE STATE CAN ALSO. ARE AS SENATOR JACKSON MENTION GO OUT OF STATE FOR OUT OF STATE RESOURCES TO UP TO A VERY SOPHISTICATED. CORE DATA PROCESS AND AN INITIALLY INTERNATIONALLY ARE AS WE DID. IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES IN THIS CASE WE HAD A NUMBER OF FIRE UNITS FROM ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES AYE WE ALSO HAVE FAR UNITS HERE FROM AUSTRALIA. BOB. SO THE. THE PLAN IS IS IS PUT IS PRETTY SOLID IT IT PROVIDES FOR THAT SYSTEMATIC MOBILIZATION LAW AND ORGANIZATION OPERATION UP A FIRE AND RESCUE IT'S NOT JUST. FIREFIGHTING ASSETS HITS ITSELF FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRE EQUIPMENT. ITS COMMUNICATIONS IT'S A SEARCH AND RESCUE ITS SWIFT WATER FLOOD RESCUE IT'S THE GAMBIT HOW THIS MATERIALS THE GAMUT OF RESOURCES THAT ARE CAP THAT MODERN FIRE SERVICES. UP PROVIDE FOR US AND I WILL TELL YOU I AS YOU HEAR A WITH SOME STATISTICAL AYE DATA W. PROVIDED BY CHEAP PADLOCK. IN THE CASE OF FIRE SPECIFIC. ALL THAT THE THE REQUIREMENT HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS UP OF THE NEED TO TAP INTO THE SYSTEM BATCHES FOR FIRE ALONE. WE HAVE ALSO MOBILIZED IN THE IN THE MOST RECENT YEARS FOR US SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT FLOODING FOR OF COURSE UNFORTUNATELY THE MUD. FLOWS IN SANTA BARBARA UP FOR MAJOR HAZMAT INCIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TRAIN DERAILMENTS OTHER KINDS OF EVENTS. SO THE SYSTEM IS VERY VERY BUSY IT'S COMPREHENSIVE IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH THE STATE EMERGENCY PLAN AND WITH OTHER PLANTS ARE AT THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL. ON ALL JURISDICTIONS OPERATE UNDER THOSE PLANS TO BE. STATE FIRE RESCUE PLAN IS AN ANNEX TO THIS TO THE STATE EMERGENCY PLAN WHICH IS THE OVER ARCHING. ALTHOUGH THE JURISDICTIONS IN IN CALIFORNIA ALL FALL UNDER THAT. THAT PLAN. BOB. VERY POOR NOTE THAT. THE THE PLAN ALSO ESTABLISHES VERY. SOPHISTICATED CAPABILITIES FOR EACH JURISDICTION PROVIDING THE ARE COUNTY OR OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATORS AND THE REGIONAL COORDINATORS. DAILY UP FIRE DEFENSE RESOURCE INVENTORIES. THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE WHAT'S DOWN WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED ARM AND THE SYSTEM INCLUDES NOT JUST. MADE UP OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE ENGINES BUT ALSO INCLUDES OF COURSE CAL FIRE ENGINES AND IT INCLUDES. KALPOE WE ASK OUR ENGINES WHICH ARE A LAYER OF RESOURCES THAT BET BET NO MATTER WHAT THE INCIDENT IS IN CALIFORNIA NO MATTER WHAT. THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE IMPACTING ANY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE WE KNOW AS A STATE WE'VE GOT THESE FORCES THAT CAN CONTAIN CAN ALWAYS BE APPLIED AND THEY'RE ALL. THEY'RE ALL RISK INJURED SO THEY CAN HANDLE WHILE MEANDER STRUCTURE HAZMAT THEY HAVE EMERGENCY MEDICAL THEY HAVE URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE CAPABILITY ON. AND. AND. AND WHILE WE'VE GOT ALL THESE RESOURCES ARE AND THAT DATABASE SYSTEM INTEGRITY IS REALLY MADE UP OF OF AYE AYE DAVID DAY COORDINATION WITH OUR LOCAL FIRE CHIEFS. A LOCAL FIRE AGENCIES ARE REGIONAL COORDINATORS AND AND OF COURSE OUR PARTNERS ACCOUNT FIRE AND AS I MENTIONED THE OTHER AGENCIES. UP THE IMPACTS ON THE SYSTEM HAVE BEEN. THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE HARM I HAVE IN MY. THIRTY YEARS HAVE NOT SEEN THE LEVEL OF REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN THEM THAT AND THE AMOUNT OF IMPACTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN. ARM AND DOWN AND I KNOW WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY AND. IMPORTANT THAT THAT MONITORS MODERNIZATION OF THE SYSTEM. IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ONE I THINK THERE'S A FEW AREAS OF THAT I'D LIKE TO NOTE ABOUT MODERNIZATION. THE FIRST IS THAT DUMB AYE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. GETTING AYE HAVING THE ABILITY TO GET REAL TIME REAL. WHO? UP A SITUATIONAL CONDITIONS AS THEIR EVOLVING OR UNFOLDING IN BEING ABLE TO GET THAT INTO THE. AT EACH OF THESE LEVELS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT. ICQ I OFTEN TALK ABOUT MEN BEING ABLE TO STAY OUT IN FRONT OF EVOLVING CRISIS AND ANY GRIEF ALL THE DISASTERS BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU LET THE DISASTER GET OUT IN FRONT OF YOU. YOU ARE IN A DEFENSIVE POSTURE YOU NEVER CAN REALLY CATCH UP IF IT EXPANDS EXPONENTIALLY WITH EACH HOUR SO STAYING OUT IN FRONT OF A DISASTER IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT FAKE. THE WORK PICKED UP THE CHIEF PAM WHAT I DO WITH WITH THE OTHER PARTNERS IS. EARLY ON PASSED THE NEED TO GET OUT IN FRONT I THINK THIS IS PLAYED OUT AS YOU YOU YOU WHAT YOU OBSERVED BUT IN THIS LAST SERIES OF DISASTERS WHERE WE WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO STAY OUT IN FRONT OF THE. EVOLVING SITUATION. THE CASE. WAS NOT POSSIBLE ARE IN THE CASE OF THE NORTHERN FIRES THESE FIRES IS THAT IS CAN WILL TELL YOU WERE MOVING AT. A AND UNBELIEVABLE RATE THEY WERE EXTREME CONDITIONS AND YOU KNOW HUMANLY POSSIBLE ABILITY TO. TO GET A RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. SO THAT SAID IF YOU CAN'T OUT RUN IT YOU HAVE TO ANTICIPATED AND ANTICIPATING IT IS USING GOOD PREDICTIVE. SERVICES LOOKING LOOKING AT THE CONDITIONS AND THEN PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT PLACE SO THAT THEIR INITIAL ATTACK CAN GET IN AND KEEP FIRE SMALL. AND WHEN YOU GOT THESE BIG WIN VANCE YOU GOT THESE VERY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS WE'VE GOT RESOURCES PLACED APPROPRIATELY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE SO. PRE POSITIONING IS A ONE OF THOSE AREAS BUT IT CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IS AN IMPROVEMENT IN OUR TECHNOLOGY. ARE IMPROVEMENT IN KNOWING WHERE RESOURCES ARE LOCATED AT ANY TIME THROUGH THINGS LIKE OUR AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATOR IT SHOULDN'T AND OTHER KIND OF RESOURCE. COORDINATORS ABA. WE WE ALSO OF OF A COUPLE YEARS AGO AT A COLLABORATION WITH CAL FIRE AND. THE US DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY CITED TEXT ALL TECHNOLOGY DIRECTORATE. STARTED TO WORK ON SOMETHING CALLED THE NEXT GENERATION INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM A THIS IS A SITUATIONAL TOOL WEEK. SCOUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IF CIOS FOR SITUATION AWARENESS COLLABORATION TOOL AND THAT IT'S A TOOL THAT IT IS NOW EVOLVING ALL BUT BUT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO INVEST MUCH MORE AND. I THOUGHT THAT IS GIVING US SOME OF THIS THIS THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS THAT I'M TALKING A. I'M AND WE'RE DOING THIS IN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH OUR PART AUSTRALIA ACTUALLY. US BECAUSE THEY HAVEA VERY SIMILAR KIND AWHILE SO WE'RE LEARNING WILDFIRE THREATS WE'RE LEARNING FROM THEM AS AS WELL AS THEM ALERTING FROM EYES IN THAT THAT BILLS THAT PARTNERSHIP. AND IN IN SCOUT IS NOW BEING UTILIZED IN A PROTOTYPE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE USE THAT. ARE IN THE LAST THE OUT OF FIRES AND IT IS PROVING TO BE REALLY A GREAT TOOL IN ITS ITS CONTINUING TO EVOLVE. BOB. SO WE TALK ABOUT OF TECHNOLOGY. BUT MODERNISATION OUR REQUIRES OF FORMALIZING THAT CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RESOURCES NEEDS IN A TIMELY WAY OP RESOURCE REQUESTING COMING TO A STANDARD SYSTEM ENSURING THAT. FOR THE YEARS TO COME IF YOU THINK THAT THIS WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY AND HERE WE ARE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WERE STILL USING THE SYSTEM IT'S INCUMBENT UPON FOLKS LIKE US. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS THIS SYSTEM IS STILL OPERATING IN THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED BUT IT'S BETTER AND IT'S A BIG MEETING THE NEED A FORTY FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE WHATEVER CALLOUS CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AT. HERE IN THE COMING YEARS WITH THE THREAT THE NEW THREAT OF CLIMATE DRIVEN. CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN A LIKE THIS BEFORE BOMB SO WITH THAT I WILL STOP HERE. I I'M JUST POINT OUT THAT THIS MAP ALL OUGHT TO LEFT ME HERE DOES. POINT OUT THE STATE WE DO BREAK THE STATE UP IN THE SIX MUTUAL AID REGION'S THIS IS OUT OF. THIS IS A. THAT IS DONE SO THAT WE IT'S QUANTIFIABLE EACH ONE OF THOSE REGIONS ARE INCORPORATES A NUMBER OF COUNTIES AND IT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO MANAGE RESOURCES IN A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE WAY. BY BREAKING THEM DOWN FROM YOU KNOW ALL THE RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA INTO REGIONAL BITES OR. OPERATIONAL BITES ARE BUT AGAIN THE IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE IF SAN DIEGO FIRE ENGINES ARE UP IN SISKIYOU COUNTY OR OR OR VICE VERSA IN FACT I ACT AS OPPOSED BY SAYING THAT. DURING THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES BECAUSE WE WE WERE COMING THROUGH AYE IN SANTA ROSA WE NOTICE THAT I ANY ENGINE FROM I THINK WAS GEYSER BILL. WE'RE THANKS MARC GOOD MORNING. SHARES DOT IN JACKSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN HAVE A LOT THAT DIRECTOR CAL FIRE AND AGAIN THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TODAY. BUT TO ADDRESS YOU. DIRECTOR KILLER DO G. REALLY PAINT THE PICTURE AND I I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT IS AN ALL HAZARD ALL RISK SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. IS JUST THAT WILDFIRES ARE THE ONE EMERGENCY AND DISASTER THAT EARLY HAPPENING ALMOST EVERY DAY. ARE ALL TWELVE MONTHS OF THE YEAR NOW SO IT IS A BIG HAS BECOME THE WELL PRACTICED. DISASTER THAT WE ARE ALL RESPONDING TO EVERY DAY IN THIS AND FOR MOST. IN WHAT WE DO UP BUT IT'S ALSO NOT JUST A LARGE DEVASTATING FIRES THAT OCCURRED IN THE NORTH BAY OR THE THOMAS FIRE ANOTHER FIRES AND SO. FOR ANYA THAT THE MUTUALLY MUTUAL AID SYSTEM RESPONSE TO. IN WILDLAND FIRES IT'S I DAILY. RELATIONSHIP ABOUT ALL ABOUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS IN COORDINATION WITH CAL FIRE. ARE PROVIDING THE CLOSEST RESOURCES INITIAL ATTACKING EVERY NEW START. BOB DURING THE PERIOD OF JULY. FOURTH WEEK. LAST YEAR BUT WE RECORDED SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE WILDLAND FIRES IN JUST ONE WEEK AND I KNOW. I TESTIFIED LAST WEEK IN A SIMILAR HEARING LITERALLY THAT AVERAGES OUT TO ONE NEW WILDLAND FIRE EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES ABOUT IN THE STATE. THAT TAKES AN ENTIRE TEAM AND COORDINATED EFFORT TO STAY ON TOP OF THAT OUR GOAL IT CAL FIRE. IS YOUR NINETY FIVE PERCENT THE FIRES CONTAINED AT TEN ACRES OR LESS AND WERE SUCCESSFULIN THAT BECAUSE OF THIS PARTNERSHIP IN TEAM. POP CLOSEST RESOURCE OF ALL FIRE AGENCIES IN THE STATE RESPONDING TO PUT THOSE FIRES OUT. UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THE CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONTINUING TO CHANGE TO WHILE WE CONTINUE TO RAMP UP. AND DO MORE WITH LESS OR WITH WHAT WE HAVE. AND ARE STILL SUCCESSFUL IN THAT NINETY FIVE PERCENT BUT THOSE FIVE PERCENT. THAT ARE ESCAPING THOSE INITIAL ATTACK EFFORTS BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS OUT THERE WHETHER FUEL. ARE BECOMING CATASTROPHIC FIRES LIKE WE SAW IN THE NORTH BAY. BOUGHT AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO IT IS CRITICAL. THAT OUR SYSTEM AS WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS ABOUT ALL THAT FOREST MANAGEMENT ALL THE RESPONSE ALL THE LAND USE PLANNING ALL THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS THAT NGUYEN INTO A NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF. ADDRESSING THESE DISASTERS THAT WERE ADDRESSING ALL OF THESE THINGS AND THE RESPONSE A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. IS KEY. UP THERE AS YOU KNOW THE FROM AB TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. THE STATE EXPERIENCE STILL THE WORST DROUGHT IN TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS THE DRIEST CONDITIONS ARE ON RECORD. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH BUT SHOULD BE OF NO SURPRISE THAT HELLFIRE WHICH IS THE LARGEST USER. OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF OUR WILD LAND. MISSION AND THE NEED. IN TWENTY TWELVE CAL FIREPLACE FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO REQUESTS. TO THE SYSTEM FOR MUTUAL AID THAT'S FIRE ENGINES ARE OVERHEAD PERSONNEL A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO STILL THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE. OVERHEAD OR PROPOSITIONS ASSIGNMENTS FOR US. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. CALIFORNIA REQUESTED ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND ELEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE REQUESTS. WENT TO THE NEW DELAYED SYSTEM IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. THE DEVASTATING VALLEY FIRE IN LEE COUNTY AND IN BICU COUNTER IN. CALAVERAS IN AMADOR THE BUTTE FIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO FILL UP SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE OF THOSE REQUESTS. ARE THEY DUG DEEP INTO THE SYSTEM THESE ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA LARGE AND SMALL. OF VOLUNTEER TO YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES CITY LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WERE ABLE TO. BUT THE BOOT STRAPS IT PUTS THOSE COMMUNITIES AT RISK. BUT PUT RESOURCES IN THE SYSTEM ODD BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN THE SYSTEM BUT AS THIS WORKLOAD CONTINUES TO INCREASE AS WE SEE CHANGING CONDITIONS AND. WERE ALL NEEDING TO PUT MORE IN THE FIRE FIGHT UP IT'S PLACING THE SINGS CREASING DEMAND. BUT ON THE OVERALL SYSTEM A VERY TELLING EYES TO WHAT'S OCCURRING OUT THERE. AS AS CHIEF BYRD DIRECTOR GALA DUTY TALKED ABOUT OUT THERE ARE A NUMBER. OF ELEMENTS OF THIS IN THE SYSTEM THAT ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO LOOK AT. AS WE DO AND WE TALK ABOUT IT AND NOT BE MAY BE A BIT BIASED BUT WE CERTAINLY AGREE THAT OUR SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD BUT IT WAS NEVER BUILT TO DEAL WITH THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY THE CONDITIONS THAT WERE FACING IN THE AMOUNT? OF THE RESPONSES AND THE AMOUNT THAT WERE ASKING FOR FROM EVERYBODY BUT IN THE SYSTEM. SO SOME THINGS ARE GOING TO BE KEY ARE AS MARK TALKED ABOUT THE SITUATION AWARENESS TOOLS WE HAVE TO NOT ONLY. A. ENHANCEMENT DOT MOUNT OF RESOURCES IN OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE RESOURCES OUT THERE BUT IT'S WE HAVE TO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN GETTING THOSE RESOURCES. AND THAT'S LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATING CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY. IN A THREE YEAR PROCESS OF OUTFITTING EVERY ONE OF OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES WITH THEM. AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATING SO WE CAN NOW IDENTIFY WHERE EVERY CAL FIRE VEHICLE IS. IN REAL TIME AND DISPATCHED THOSE RESOURCES. RIGHT DIRECTLY FROM ONE OF OUR TWENTY ONE EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTERS AROUND THE STATE THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT. SEAMLESS OPERATING PICTURE ACROSS ALL OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCES THAT RESPONDING ALL OF THE. YES RESOURCES THAT RESPONDED BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE LOOK AT EVERYTHING ON AN INCIDENT AT THE CLOSEST RESOURCES THERE. ARE A NUMBER OF NEW TOOLS LOOKING AT REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT THE NATIONAL GUARD AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY ASSETS HAVE BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL. LOOKING AT DE PROVIDING REAL TIME IMAGERY FROM. FROM ABOVE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT THAT BOTH IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AS WELL. AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR THOSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING TO BE KEY. GOING FORWARD INCLUDING. POTENTIAL SATELLITE TO A DATA. BUT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT OUR COMMAND CENTERS ACROSSTHE STATE NOT JUST CAL FIRE BUT. ALL OF OUR BUT WE HAS OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMAND CENTERS BECAUSE ALL OF THESE CENTERS ARE SUPPORTING TOGETHER. ORGANIZING RESOURCES ARE NOT JUST MANAGING THE EMERGENCIES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS BUT MANY OF THEM. I HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS A RESERVE COORDINATION CENTERS TO MOBILIZE RESOURCES TO MOVE OUTSIDE OF THEIR OPERATIONAL A RECENT DURING. THAT THEY ALL HAVE THE CAPACITY THE TRAINING THE EXPERTISE. TO BE READY TO PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES WHERE WHEN THEY'RE NEEDED BUT JOINT TRAINING ACROSS THAT AL OF US TO ENSURE THAT WERE ALL WHETHER ITS. STATE FEDERAL LOCAL BUT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE BRAWL COORDINATING RESOURCES AS WE RAMP UP AND PROVIDE PRE DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCES. IT'S IN A COORDINATED FASHION SO THAT SEAMLESS AND AGAIN WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER MAKING THOSE DECISIONS ARE TO GET THOSE RESOURCES ARE OUT THERE. OUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOKING AT THAT AGAIN MODERNIZING OUR RESOURCE TRACKING SYSTEM CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT OF RESOURCES IN THE EXISTING RESOURCE ORDER AND STATUS SING SYSTEM FIFTY PERCENT OF THE RESOURCES GET MOVED EVERY YEAR. AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE ARE DRIVING THE NEED THAT WE ALSO HAVE A NEED TO BE PART OF THAT NATIONAL SYSTEM BECAUSE. NATIONAL RESOURCES COMMAND AND IT'S CALIFORNIA RESOURCES LEAVE THE STATE BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS AS WELL. THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY NEED TO BE SITTING DOWN AT THE TABLE ENSURE WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO COORDINATE WHAT GOES ON ALL HAZARD WITHIN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS. NOT YOUR EXTERNALLY IN WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS. AND AS WE FOUND OUT. PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES BUT IN THE THOMAS FIRES WELL WHETHER IS KEY UNDERSTANDING WHAT WEATHER IS DOING. WELL AS KEEN AS WE TALK ABOUT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOLS. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO PREDICTIVE SERVICES WE HAVE A BILL IDENTIFY WERE RED FLAG CONDITIONS AND WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY HE'S. BUT. THE WEATHER FORECASTS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES. YOU KNOW THAT WEEKEND OF OCTOBER SEVENTH AND EIGHTH IS A BROAD AREA WE KNEW THAT WE HAD A BROAD AREA. OF OF FIRE WHETHER. WE NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING TOREFINE OUR WEATHER FORECAST GET THEM DOWN TO THE MICRO LEVEL WHERE WE CAN SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE AN AREA LIKE MARK WHISPERINGS. AND COFFEE PART THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL UP FOR A NGUYEN SERVICING. AT A MUCH FINER SCALE NOT ONLY CAN HELP IN THE PRE DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCES BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE OPPORTUNITIES. ARE TO TIE IN WITH WARNING SYSTEMS AND OTHER MEASURES THAT ARE OUT THERE. IS A LOT THAT GOES ON WE TALK A LOT ABOUT CAL FIRES TYPE ONE INSTANT MANAGEMENT TEAMS THAT ENGAGED IN PUT ALL ORGANIZED ALL OF THESE FIRES IN THE NORTH BAY. AND THE FIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALTOGETHER BRINGING ALL OF THE RESOURCES TOGETHER BUT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS OUT THERE AS WELL DURING THE NORTH BAY FIRES THERE WERE THREE. TYPE THREE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS DEPLOYED WITHIN THESE INCIDENTS PRIMARILY STAFFED YOU MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND THEY WERE ENGAGING IN SOME VERY TECHNICAL CRITICAL. ACTIVITIES INCLUDING SUPPORTING THE RELOCATION AND OUT OF THE CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. PATIENTS ARE AND RESIDENTS WHO WAS A IT WAS A CRITICAL POPULATION. UP THAT NEEDED A VERY BAD CRITICAL LOGISTICS AND PLANNING SUPPORT. THOSE TEAMS DID THAT AS WELL AS OUR OTHER MANAGING OTHER SMALLER FIRES AROUND THE STATE. TO AGAIN OVER ALL THIS IS ABOUT CAPACITY IT'S ABOUT. A GROUP OF. FIRE AND EMERGENCY PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN CALIFORNIA TOGETHER. TO RAISE THIS BAR AND MOVE US FORWARD. AGAIN TO BE READY. FOR THE NEXT DECADE AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE THINGS CHANNELS OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF QUESTIONS. CENTER BRADFORD THANK YOU I'M GONNA THINK BUG DIRECTOR AND CHIEF YOU COMMENT AND I KNOW THIS IS A FOCUS ON. MUTUAL AID AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE RESPONDED TIME AFTER TIME. AND NOT ONLY. SAVING LIVES CHIEF TO UPON SOMETHING THAT. I WOULD WANT TO KNOW IF WE CAN EXPAND UPON AND MORE ON THE PREVENTION SIDE OFF BEFORE WE NEED TO CALL IN ALL THESE RESOURCES AND YOU MENTIONED ONE THING THAT. HURT CONGRESSMAN ON CARE MONDAY MENTIONED AND TO LAST RICH FIRE. BETTER MANAGEMENT OF OUR FORCED AND ON WHERE WE IN THAT IF WE CAN COORDINATE AND HAVE BETTER FORCE MANAGEMENT I THINK. WE COULD CURTAIL THE YOU KNOW LONG BURNING FIRES AT MANY FOLKS. CONTINUE HONOR CONTRIBUTE SOLELY TO. CLIMATE CHANGE BUT IF WE'RE NOT MANAGING THE FORCE WE HAVE THE FUEL THERE AND THAT. TO THE FAR SO OUR IS OUR COORDINATION IN THE LOCAL OR REGIONAL OR NOW. FORCE DEPARTMENTS TO HELP IMPROVE THAT AREA. BUDGET A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND IT IS YOU OFTEN IT WILL HEAR ME SAY. IT'S. ALL TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX WE OBVIOUSLY TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE. PRE POSITIONING IN THE RESPONSE AND THE TOOLS TO COORDINATE THE RESPONSE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO BE INVESTING IN. FIRE PREVENTION FUELS TREATMENT. ALL ALL THE ACTIVITIES TO TRY TO BREAK THIS CYCLE OF CATASTROPHIC DEVASTATING FIRES WHEN THEY DO. OCCUR AND THAT INVOLVES A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. ARE IN OUR WILD LANDS IN OUR WHILE AN URBAN INTERFACE AREAS THOSE AREAS WHERE THE WILD LANDS MEET THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. AS WELL AS THE FOUR STOOD COMMUNITIES THE AREAS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES DEAD FROM. EPIDEMIC OUTBREAKS OF INSECTS BECAUSE OF. DROUGHT AND BECAUSE OF THE CHANGING CONDITIONS WERE SEEING. ARE IN THE CLIMATE OF IT MEANS AN INVESTMENT IN THESE AREAS IT MEANS GETTING OUT AHEAD. PUTTING MORE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE OUT THERE WHERE WE CAN IT MEANS MANAGING OUR FORESTS THROUGH THINNING IT MEANS HARVESTING TREES TO GIVE. IT SOME RETURNS TO INVESTORS ARE LANDOWNERS CAN REINVEST AND PUT MORE WORK OUT ON THE GROUND THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE OF INVESTED SO WELL IN CAP AND TRADE FUNDING FOR FOREST HEALTH. BY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR THAT'S ALL GOING OUT ALMOST ENTIRELY. OUGHT TO SUPPORT EFFORTS OUT THROUGHOF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WHETHER THEY BE FIRE DISTRICTS FIRE SAFE COUNCILS LA AND MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO GET REAL WORK DONE ON THE GROUND NOT ONLY IN THE URBAN INTERFACE AREAS SUCH AS WE SAW. PUBLICLY IN SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES WERE THOSE BRUSH COVERED LANDS MET THE HOUSES BUT ALSO IN OUR FORCE DID LANDSCAPES IN THE SIERRA. AND IN THE COAST WHERE WE NEED TO BE DOING IT AGAIN MORE FORCED MANAGEMENT WORKS IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF THIS. TOGETHER CAN TAKE LAND USE PLANNING TO ENSURE THAT BUILT ENVIRONMENT. BOB IS MORE RESISTANT TO THESE KINDS OF FIRES. SENATE JACKSON. THANK YOU AND AND A CENTER BRADFORD I'VE THE BILL JUST ON THIS SUBJECT VICTOR. JUST SO HAPPENS S. B. TWELVE SO SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PLAN FOR THIS NEW NORMAL BETTER TO THAT FOR ON THE PREVENTION SIDE. I OF A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY THE FIRST THE IT IS SO. ARE ARE CALIFORNIA'S TRIBES PART OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. AND WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRIBES AS FAR CISCO'S THERE ARE. THERE ARE TRIBES THAT ARE BETTER UP PART OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND I. TYPICALLY THAT. IT'S SORT AHEAD MESS BECAUSE SOME TRIBES HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO HAVE RESOURCES WITHIN THEIR. TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. AND SOME DON'T THE ONES THAT DON'T TYPICALLY OBVIOUSLY DON'T PARTICIPATE BUT WE'VE HAD. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE TRIBES THAT HAVE HAD DOWN. FOR EXAMPLE THAT GUY GAMING I DON'T EVEN KNOW FROM RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO PUT FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN PLACE. EACH OF THOSE TRIBES A WORK WITH THE LOCAL ART COUNTY CHIEF ORGANIZATION. AND AS LONG AS THEY MEET THE STANDARDS THAT ARE REQUIRED OTHER ALLOWED TO COME IN AND WE GIVEN. US CALL A DESIGNATOR NUMBER AND THEN WE WILL MOVE IN THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. IS THERE ANYTHING WE MIGHT TO TO ENCOURAGE MORE COLLABORATION WITH THE TRIBES OR DO YOU FEEL THAT WE DON'T. GET THAT THERE WERE COVERED AS IT IS. WELL WE CAN ALWAYS YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS UP BROWN FOR IMPROVEMENT IN ANY TYPE OF A COLLABORATION. THAT AGAIN THAT THOSE TRIBES THAT HAVE REALLY. WHEN WE'VE USED THEM A LOT AND A LOT OF CASES THEY DO BRING RESOURCES TO THE TABLE. YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD PARTNERSHIP BUT YOU KNOW WE COULD CERTAINLY ALWAYS TRIED TO LOOK FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THOSE GOING FORWARD HERE ARE. CAN WE TALK A LOT ABOUT MONEY WE NEED MONEY FOR THE SYSTEM BUT HOWARD THE RESPONSE CALL SHARED AMONG THE MUTUALLY JURISDICTIONS I WAS HOOKED ON TODAY. HOW WELL BE? IT'S AN ASIAN QUESTION BECAUSE. FUNDING SOURCES ARE CAN COME FROM A VARIETY OF AREAS IT IT REALLY DEPENDS UPON. WHOSE ORDERING THE RESOURCE. AND. WANTED THE CONDITIONS THAT EXIST. DURING THAT PARTICULAR TIME SO. FOR EXAMPLE IF FROM YOUR FATHER ACCOUNT VIRUS IS MANAGING A FIRE ON ON A STATE RESPONSIBILITY LEE AND. THE IN THEIR ORDERING UP RESOURCES IT SAYS CHEAP THAT MUCH SAID WERE BIGGEST USER OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. ARE THERE TAPPING INTO THAT SYSTEM AND. IN THOSE CONDITIONS. THE ABILITY FOR CAL FIRE TO UTILIZE ITS FUNDING SOURCES TO PAY. OFF THOSE RESOURCES EXIST HOWEVER THAT SAID. NOT MANY OF THESE CASES. OUGHT MAY QUALIFY WHAT WE CALL FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANT THE USER FEDERAL FUNDS. THAT IT THAT THIS PROGRAM IS COORDINATED THROUGH A WE ASK AND IF THIS CRITERIA THAT IS MAD. ITEM IT'S HIGHLY POP ALL POSSIBLE THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE LOW. RESPONSE COST COULD BE COVERED UNDER THAT. THAT F. MAKE. BET BENDERS THE CASE IF IT GOES TO A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT FUNDING IS MADE AVAILABLE OR FOR GOES TO A PRESIDENTIAL AYE THEN STAFFORD ACT MONEY IS MADE AVAILABLE SO. IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES UP BUT LET ME JUST PUT THE COPY OUT THERE THAT. THE MUTUAL AID THE MASTER MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT AS IT IS DESIGNED. IS IS UP HERE MASTER MUTUAL LATE IS REALLY. DESIGN IS NEIGHBOR HELPING NEIGHBOR IT IS VOLUNTARY AND IT IS A RECIPROCAL. THERE IS NO DIRECT MONEY ATTACHED TO A MASTER MUTILATE SELL. SOMETIMES. JURISDICTIONS ARE HELPING OTHER JURISDICTIONS WITH NO EXPECTATION OF COST KNOWING THAT MAYBE TODAY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU MY ENGINES AND TOMORROW YOU MAY NEED TO GIVE ME YOURS. BUT WE GET IN THESE BIG LOGS SUSTAIN OPERATIONS THEIR HOUSE TO BE A FUNDING SOURCE AND THOSE OF THE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES THAT THEY CAN'T COME FROM. SO IF WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE MUTUAL AID CALLS WHERE A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE. GOING OUT TO HELP HELP ELSEWHERE AND THEY THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. AGAIN GOING FORWARD LOOKING FORWARD IS THERE SOME SUGGESTION YOU MIGHT HAVE AS TO. HOW WE WANT ENCOURAGED MUTUAL AID BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE WHEN THESE LOCAL AGENCIES LOOK AT THEIR BOTTOM LINE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO COVER THEIR OWN AREA AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO IT EITHER IS IS THERE SOMETHING WE COULD DO GOING FORWARD ON? THAT. WELL I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING NOW PARTICULARLY. AT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE SEEING A I'M A POTENTIAL SCENARIO EVOLVING WHERE WE WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE A FIRE IS GOING TO A YOU KNOW WE GET BIGGER OR GET THEM. SEVERE IN A PARTICULAR AREA IS BEING ABLE TO MOVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCES AND BE ABLE% TO COVER THEIR COSTS IN IN THAT. WILL BE CALLED THAT GOTTEN NAM. BUT TIM HIS. THE MOVE UP A COVER WE HAVE THE. WEAKEST REPOSITIONING SORRY UP REPOSITIONING RESOURCES. AND. THAT'S ONE AREA. A A YOU KNOW. GENERALLY. ARE. THERE ARE SOME DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE A LOT OF PERSONNEL BUT NOT ENOUGH EQUIPMENT AND THERE'S SOME DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE MORE EQUIPMENT AND NOT ENOUGH PERSONNEL. SO IN IT DOES COTTAGES ADDITIONAL FUNDING ACROSS OF OF THE VARIOUS SPECTRUMS COULD HELP EITHER BY. ADDING ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT INTO THE SYSTEM OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS ARE ARE CONTINUING TO AUGMENT THE OAS ENGINE FLEET. THAT IS SO THAT IS ACTUALLY UP A PROGRAM THAT AS YOU KNOW OF THOSE. YES ENGINES ARE GIVEN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNDER AN AGREEMENT THAT WHEN THE STATE NEEDS THEM THEN THEY DEPLOY THOSE. ODD THAT HELPS AUGMENT THE SYSTEM AND THEN THE ABILITY THROUGH GRANTS. WHERE? WHERE? LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE PERSONNEL CAN ENHANCE THEIR. THERE RIGHT RESOURCE CAPABILITIES THAT THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY OF AREAS THAT I THINK THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD WITH LAST QUESTION. HOW DOES THE INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE? A CHANGES OUTSIDE RESOURCES ARE BROUGHT IN AND OTHER WORDS. S. THING SHIFT YOU HAVE MORE MORE ENTITIES COMING AND HELPING. US WHO WHO'S IN CHARGE AND HOW DOES IT WORK AT THAT POINT. IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND THAT'S WHERE AGAIN CALIFORNIA WAS THE LEADER IN THIS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AFTER WE HAD A DECADE A VERY DODD DAMAGING FIRES AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA. UNDEVELOPED FIRE SCOPE ABOUT FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES. FOR OF CALIFORNIA ORGANIZED FOR EMERGENCIES BECAUSE WITH THAT. DIFFERENT RADIO FREQUENCIES DIFFERENT HOSE FITTINGS WE WERE AND WE'VE HAD THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT FIGHTING THE SAME FIRE NOT EVEN TALKING TO EACH OTHER NO COMMAND WHATSOEVER. SO THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED WHICH IS NOW BEEN ADOPTED NATIONALLY WHO DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER RESOURCES COMING IN FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK. OR QUITE FRANKLY FROM AUSTRALIA. BECAUSE MANY MANY COUNTRIES ARE ARE BUYING INTO THE SYSTEM AS WELL OF THIS JURISDICTIONS HAVING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT PIECE OF GROUND OR THAT DISASTER. BAHAR THE INCIDENT COMMANDER'S IT CAN BE MANY. THE CASE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE MULTIPLE RESPONSIBILITIES WITHIN ONE AT JURISDICTION THAT PIECE OF GROUND TOUCHES. PROP STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS OF EACH OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS GET A SEAT AT THE TABLE AS PART OF THE UNIFIED COMMAND THEY EACH GET AN EQUAL SAY. IN THE DECISIONS IN THE A CONTROL OBJECTIVES THAT ARE GOING ON FOR THAT EMERGENCY. ALL OF THE RESOURCES COMING INTO THAT EMERGENCY ARE ALL ORGANIZED UNDER THOSE UNIFIED. COMMANDERS AND I AS WE'VE SEEN WE HAD HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT URISDICTIONS PROVIDING RESOURCES TO THESE FIRES THEY WERE ALL GROWING UP UNDER THE UNDER ONE INCIDENT ACTION PLAN. ALL POINTING TOWARDS THE INCIDENT COMMANDER'S AND AGAIN MULTIPLE UNIFIED COMMANDERS ALL UNDER ONE GOVERNANCE ONE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IN THOSE INCIDENT COMMANDERS ARE COME THEY COME FROM THE STATE THROUGH A WE S. OR ARE THEY LOCAL WHO. THEN SORT OF EMERGE AS THE CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE SO THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO IT'S A LITTLE OF ALL OF THE ABOVE SO WITH AS A AS AN EMERGENCY PROGRESSES AND WE'LL TAKE A WILDLAND FIRE THAT. HAS BEEN THE FIRE STARTS IN THE AGENCIES RESPOND THAT AGENCY OR AGENCIES HAVING JURISDICTION WILL IMMEDIATELY TAKE COMMAND A COULD BE THAT FIRE CAPTAIN ON THAT FIRE ENGINE THAT'S FIRST IN. ULTIMATELY THE BATTALION CHIEFS WILL RESPOND AND ORGANIZE THIS EFFORT AND AND THOSE OF THE AGENCIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE AS IT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX. IF IT'S A CAL FIRE A STATE RESPONSIBILITY VERY INCIDENT WE WILL CONFER AND MAKE A DECISION IF IT'S GOING TO BECOME. A MORE COMPLEX TO BRING IN AN INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM DOES INTENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS ARE. CAL FIRE LEAD HOWEVER THEY ARE INTER AGENCY THERE ARE MEMBERS OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS ABOUT BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE THAT ARE PART OF THAT. AND THAT COULD THEN TEAM UP WITH. A LOCAL ENTITY GOOD YOU KNOW. MOST LIKELY HERE WHO ARE HERE FROM CHIEF ARDENER LATER IN THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA HE WAS A UNIFIED COMMANDER HE TIED IN. WITH OUR I SEE. ON THE TUBS FIRE THE SANTA ROSA FIRES BECAUSE AGAIN HIS JURISDICTION WAS INVOLVED IN SO JUST BECAUSE IT'S A CAL FIRE TEAM DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE OTHER INCIDENT COMMANDERS THAT PLUGIN. ALL OF IT IS COORDINATED A IN THE CASE OF THE THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES LAST YEAR'S THROUGH. ABOUT THE STATE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WE SAT DOWN AT A TABLE AND COORDINATED HOW WE WERE DEPLOYING TEAMS WHERE THESE TYPE THREE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TEAMS WOULD BE DEPLOYED. ALL OF THAT WAS DONE KIND OF UNDER AN OVER ARCHING STATES. RESPONSE IN COORDINATION. WHICH BY THE WAY IS DESIGNED. UNDER ABOUT ICS FORMAT SO AT EVERY LEVEL. THE TERMINOLOGY IS THE SAME THE THE UNDERSTANDING WE LOOK AT ALL THE ACTION REPORTS IT'S AN ACTION PLANS THAT ARE COME UP. AND AT THE STATE'S HIGHEST LEVEL WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE UNIFIED COORDINATION GROUP ALL OF THESE ARE UNIFIED SO THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE ALL THESE DIFFERENT RESOURCES. AND AND BE ABLE TO TO MAKE THAT THE MOST APPROPRIATE DECISIONS. SENATOR GAINES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WANTED TO. THANK THE CHAIR OF FOR PUTTING THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING TOGETHER. AND. AS HOPE THAT LAST YEAR'S DEVASTATING FIRES. WHERE AN ANOMALY AND THAT WE NEVER SEE THOUSANDS OF HOMES BURNED TO THE GROUND? I WOULD NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO MUCH LOS. AND SO MANY FAMILIES DISPLACED EVER AGAIN. BUT THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT WE NEED BETTER FORCE MANAGEMENT OR WE WILL SEE A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S RUINOUS WILDFIRES ARE FORCE ARE CLOGGED. DECADES OF NEGLECT WITH MILLIONS OF ACRES COVERED WITH THICK LAYERS OF TENDER. JUST WAITING TO EXPLODE. BUT THE TREATMENT MORTALITY CRISIS. ARE BALLPARK PROBLEMS ARE LIKELY TO GET WORSE. UNLESS WE CAN UNDERTAKE A MASSIVE FORCE CLEARING PROJECT WILL ROB THESE FIRES. OF THE FUEL THEY NEED TO DEVASTATE COMMUNITIES BETTER FORCE MANAGEMENT ALSO LEAST MORE PRODUCTIVE WATERSHEDS. WHICH HELPS IN TIMES OF DROUGHT AND CAN HELP SUPPORT A THRIVING BIOMASS SECTOR. IN OUR STATE. WHICH WOULD HELP GIVE VALUE TO THE FORCE WAIT. WASTE AND CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THEIR STATE. FOR THE TIMBER INDUSTRIES PINK CRIPPLED BY OVER ZEALOUS REGULATION. ALL THAT WOULD MITIGATE OUR PROBLEMS BUT NOT ELIMINATE AT THEM SO TODAY'S HEARING IS OF GREAT VALUE. WITH THAT I WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR BRAVE FIRST RESPONDERS. HE'S TRAINING TIRELESS WORK AN INCREDIBLE BRAVERY TRULY MAKE THEM LIFESAVING HEROES. WE ALL OWE THEM OUR DEEPEST GRATITUDE. WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO SUPPORT THEM INCREASE THEIR SAFETY DURING THESE CRISES. REGARDING NEXT STEPS ARE HOWEVER WE INCORPORATING BIOMASS INTO OUR NEW MORE FORCE MANAGEMENT PLANS. SO ABOUT BIOMASS IS OBVIOUSLY ONE PIECE OF THE THE BIGGER. TRY. DISCUSSION TO BRING INFRASTRUCTURE BACK TO OUR FORCE DID COMMUNITIES SO THAT WE HAVE. MEASURES IN PLACE TO TREAT THIS THE VEGETATION AS YOU DISCUSS AND AND AND. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A COMPLEX ISSUE. BECAUSE BIOMASS OBVIOUSLY REQUIRES BY BRINGING IT TO A FACILITY. CO GENERATION. EITHER HEAT OR ELECTRICITY AND OF COURSE THERE NEEDS TO BE THE PROCUREMENT ABOUT IF SOMEONE TO BUY THAT ELECTRICITY OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX SITUATION. BUT IT'S CRITICAL AND IT'S ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS FOR GOING TO STEP UP OUR GAME AND REINVESTING MANAGING ARE FORCED TO NOT ONLY REDUCE THE THREAT FROM FIRE. BUT ALL INCREASE THE FORCED HEALTH SO WE DON'T HAVE A EPIDEMIC LEVELS OF INSECTA OUTBREAK BOB INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO BE KEY AND AND NOT JUST BIOMASS BUT YOU KNOW I THE ENTIRE. WOOD PROCESSING OF SWEET OF OF INDUSTRY FROM FROM LUMBER TO OTHER PRODUCTS. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL WE HAVE WE CAN USE ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK ON IT SINCE I WAS ELECTED IN OH SEVEN. AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN GET COOPERATION ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS TO DO. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PROPERLY MANAGE OUR FORCE WE HAD AN CORPS FIRING O. SEVEN THE TAHOE BASIN WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE? BUT THE FIRES DIDN'T KCK UP AND BASICALLY BURN THE WHOLE BASIN DOWN. WILL BE LOST WELL I SAY ONLY BUT WAS TWO AND FIFTY HOMES. SO. I'M JUST HOPING THAT WE CAN GET A REAL ACTION THIS TIME I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR THE JOB THAT YOU'VE DONE. IN TERMS OF THE HORRENDOUS FIRES THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED AND WORRIED. ABOUT THE FUTURE AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO IT RIGHT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING SO. THANK SENATOR IT I WANNA KEEP FOCUSED ON. THE. FIRST THE MUTUAL AID HERE OF AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I THINK WE COULD HAVE ANOTHER HEARING JUST ON THAT AND INSURANCE AND POWER AND. IT ALL SORTS OF IT AND WE WILL. BRADFORD FOR THE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY BECAUSE IT WE COULD WE COULD BE HERE. AND A LOTTA. CENTER MCGUIRE. IF YOU SO MUCH SHERMAN DARDEN. I. I THINK THAT. I WILL SPEAK FOR ALL OF US SO TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF I THINK THAT WE ARE FACING THIS NEW REALITY. AYE IN OVER THE LAST THIRTY SIX MONTHS EVERY TIME WE SAY IT'S AN ON PRESIDENT WHILE IN FIRE GETS WORSE. WE THE BALLOT FIRE WHICH THEN IT WHICH ECLIPSE THE OPEN HILLS FIRE. BUT WE THEN HAVE TO CLEAN FIRE LAKE COUNTY WITHIN AT THE NORTH BAY A FIRE STORM WHICH WAS. BEYOND THE PALE BUT IN THE WE ALSO THE THOMAS FIRE. AND I THINK WE NEED TO STOP SAYING THAT THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED AND PREPARE FOR WHAT OUR NEW REALLY TRULY IS. AND THERE WERE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE ADVANCE ABOUT A DECADE AGO VIA GOVERNOR'S BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION NOT AND I'M HOPING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ALL WORK TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE. RESOLUTION TO SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO THINK WE ARE. BOB WE'RE CONFRONTING OUR NEW REALITY. WISH TWENTY CENTURY SOLUTIONS CURRENTLY WHEN WE ARE FACING IN THIS NEW NORMAL THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SO COUPLE OF ITEMS. SEWING DISPATCH BUT SO IF WE'RE GONNA EXPAND CAPACITY WITHIN THE SYSTEM. A TRIGGERED A GEO DEI JUST MENTIONED UPON YOU WE WENT OVER THE POTENTIAL OF ENHANCING MODERNIZING COMMUNICATION BUT A POOR PUTTING. ADDITIONAL ENGINES AND PERSONNEL AND SYSTEM OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SIDE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ABLE TO GET. TO AND FROM AYE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. AND IF CAO FIRE IS GOING TO BE EQUIPPING ALL OF THEIR ENGINES OVER THE NEXT THIRTY SIX MONTHS. OF WAY IF TRACKING EQUIPMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS DIDN'T NEED TO DO THE TO DO THE SAME SO TALK ABOUT THAT SO THAT ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT WHICH I LOVE IN YOUR APPS. HOW DO WE EQUIP? THAT WHOLE TEAM WITH THE SAME EQUIPMENT SO EVERYONE IS DOING THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU ARE TIRED TOUCH BACK DISPATCH AND TRACKING. BOB I MEAN. EUROPE CORRECT. THIS IS THAT IF THIS IS A. HAVE TO PURCHASE A HOLISTIC VIEW IT'S NOT JUST ENGINES IT'S IT'S NOT JUST. OR FIREFIGHTERS IT'S IT'S ARE HAVING A CAPACITY WITHIN OUR. OUR DISPATCHERS IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMEHOW BEING. BOB OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR COMMAND CENTERS ARE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE THE SAME SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT'S CUTTING EDGE I THINK IF IF IF ANYTHING. ELSE REQUIRES CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY IT'S GOTTA BE WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. AND. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ALSO NOT CURRENTLY COME OUT WHICH HOLD THE OTHER HEARING I'M SURE. EXPANDING. NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE IN CALIFORNIA EXPANDING OUR OUR AND UP AND UP UP REPEATING THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS BACKBONE THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT. CALIFORNIA'S FORTY SOMETHING YEARS OLD AND AND. IN SOME AREAS IT'S IT'S BEEN MODERNIZE IN SOME AREAS WERE STILL WORKING WITH THE. DUCT TAPE DIDN'T AND BALING WIRE AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE APPROACH THIS IN A HOLISTIC VIEW. SENATOR AND. AND AND THAT IS NOT JUST GETTING THE PERSONNEL ARE ITS TRAINING THEM IT'S MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND. THAT. THAT WE ARE. DEALING WITH A NEW REALITY UP IT'S ALSO ENGAGING OUR PARTNERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THERE IS SOME TREMENDOUS CAPABILITY. THAT. THAT THEY HAVE IN AND OUT OF THE EX CHIEF AND I HAVE BEEN BEEN TALKING WITH SOME. PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING HIGH LEVEL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WITHOUT OUR CAPABILITIES FOR THE MILITARY WERE TRYING TO USE MILITARY. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IT TO OUR ENVIRONMENT THESE ARE ALL GOING TO BE THINGS THAT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THEY NEED MONEY TO DO THAT AND THEY NEED OF FOCUS TO DO THAT AND. AND LEADERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO GET US THERE BUT I I BELIEVE WE'RE ON THAT THAT TRACK AND AND WITH YOUR HELP. AND JUST LAST TWO QUESTIONS MR CHURNED UP FOR A DISCO IN THERE I JUST WANTED MOMENT EYES A CHAIR IN THE TRUMAN DID A HIGH IN THE BEGINNING TO SAY THANK YOU TO TRIGGER DO CHEATING. JAPAN WHAT UP PHENOMENAL GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK ACT AND KNOW THAT THERE'S CAN BE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD IN PARTICULAR FOR TRIGGER DUTY IN THE CLEAN UP SO. I THINK YOU SO MUCH. TO BOTH YOU. ON THE ISSUES. TWO LAST QUESTIONS ON REIMBURSEMENTS. AND THEN ALSO TRAINING ON THE GROUND. I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES IS TRYING TO BE ARE TO GET THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REIMBURSES QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA DEBTS IN ITEM THAT NEED TO BE LOOKED AT THROUGH LOOKING MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. IN THE OTHER ITEM IS AND I'M. A LOOK AT IT AS A A RELATED ITEM YOU'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS NEW REPORT THAT HAS. NOT COME OUT SOME WITH SOME FINDINGS IN REGARD TO THE COUNTY CINEMA AND HAVING STANDARDIZED TRAINING ON THE GROUND FOR THOSE EMERGENCY MANAGERS AS WELL. WHETHER IT'S KNOWING. ABOUT THE LATEST ON THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE I'D TO MAKING SURE THAT THERE. IS A JOINT COMMAND IN THE BEGINNING IF YOU DON'T MIND TOUCHING BASE ON THOSE TWO ITEMS IMMIGRANTS REIMBURSEMENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEN THAT. I. NEED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL CRITICALLY FOR EMERGENCY MANAGERS. WELL. ON THE FARM. ON THE CASE A REIMBURSEMENT I MEAN REIMBURSEMENTS ALWAYS. SOMETHING THAT WE. STRIVE IN BUT ALL THIS COMES THROUGH WE ASKED AND AND. WE HAVE. CONTINUALLY WORK TO. ESTABLISH PROGRAMS AND PROCESS TO ACCELERATE THE PACE AT WHICH REIMBURSEMENTS ARE MADE. RECENTLY WE'VE WE'VE IN AND. ENGAGED IN A MUCH MORE. TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN CAPABILITY TO DO THAT. ARM. I THOUGHT THAT THERE IS STILL A LEVEL OF. I WHAT I WOULD SAY OLD SCHOOL IN THAT YOU KNOW OUR FIRE ASSETS ARE RESPONDING. BABY TO GET TO THE END SAID THEY GO THROUGH DEMOBILIZATION WHAT'S THE GO TO DEMOBILIZATION THEY'VE GOTTA FILL OUT WHAT WE CALL IN THAT FORTY TWO IT'S A. HAND WRITTEN PAPER WORK OUR. CHIEF OFFICERS ON THE GROUND ARE COORDINATING THIS BELT OUT PAPERWORK IT'S BROUGHT BACK INTO A WE ASKED WE GO THROUGH IT AND YOU TO GET ALL. THAT'S IN THE AREA THAT NEEDS TO BE STREAMLINED. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THE BOTTOM LINE SERIES THERE HASN'T BEEN. YOU DON'T FUNDING TO DO THAT AND AND AND THE AND THE EMPHASIS BUT. THAT'S ONE AREA TO ACCELERATE THE PACE THAT WE GET PEOPLE PAID NOW. I'M BALLOTS WITH THE SAY THAT THAT IT'S JUST UPS SHOT OUT TO THE CREW THAT'S WORKING ON THIS I MEAN THAT. THE FOLKS AT A WE HAVE TO DO REIMBURSEMENT OUR WAY TO WORKING NIGHT AND DAY IN AND THEY PAY DAY TRIED XCELERATED MANY PAYMENTS AS THEY. POSSIBLY CAN NOW NOT ALL PAYMENTS ALSO COME THROUGH THROUGH THE STATE THERE ARE FEDERAL. PAYMENTS AND THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER CASE THAT I THINK WE COULD TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU GOT DIFFERENT PEOPLE PLAYERS ARE UP PAYING. OUR BIGGEST PAPERBACK SENATOR DODD'S QUESTION HERB SENATOR JACKSCREWS XIN WHO WHERE THE FUNDING COME FROM. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. THEY'RE EASIER THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE IT'S STILL IN SOME WAYS ARE OLD SCHOOL AND THEY CAN BE I IMPROVE ON THE CASE OF. THIS IS NOT JUST EMERGENCY MANAGERS LIKE I THINK. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE LOOK ALL DISASTERS ARE LOCAL BASED THEY START THEIR. AND THEY AND THEIR. AS MUCH AS THE STATE COMES IN AND ALL OF US GET IMPACTED THE ECONOMY THE STATE GETS IMPACTED OUR RESEARCH GET ACTED. DISASTERS HAPPEN WHERE PEOPLE LIVE THEY GO TO CHURCH TO GO TO SCHOOL ALL OF THESE THINGS AND SO WE NEED TO TAKE OUT AND ACT ACCOUNT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OVERALL NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A NEW NORM. ARM YOUR LOCAL ELECTED BODIES YOUR EMERGENCY MANAGERS PERSONAL PUTTING EMPHASIS ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WOULD BE A GREAT STEP FORWARD AND THAT'S A. OVER THE YEARS IT'S BEEN HIT AND MISS AS TO HOW MUCH EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT REALLY TOUCHES A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS AS YOU'VE ALL EXPERIENCED IN THIS RECENT SET OF FIRES. IT'S NOT JUST THE RESPONSE IF THE RECOVERY AND ALL THE SOCIAL ISSUES AND AS I SAY OFTEN THE ACHILLES HEEL WITH ANY OF THESE EVENTS IS REALLY THE RECOVERY. SO WHILE WE RESPONDING IN USING THAT MUTUAL AID CAPABILITY TO PUT THE FIRES OUT. BESSIE MUTUALLY CAPABILITY TO TO SOME LEVEL IS USED TO DO THE RECOVERY OPERATIONS. THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH A STRONG LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AND THAT MEANS THAT YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGERS YOUR LOCAL FIRE CHIEF YOUR LOCAL POLICE CHIEFS. NEED TO BE COORDINATED THAT NEED TO BE WELL TRADE AND THAT ALSO STEPS INTO THE WHOLE THING ABOUT. PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS ASKED OF. AGAIN BRAGGING TO IT'S OFF TOPIC LAND USE PLANNING WHERE WE SEEING THE CURRENT THREATS. DEPEND WHAT I TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT BECAUSE IT DOES PLAY INTO HOW WE DO RESOURCE ALLOCATION. HAS TO WHAT ARE THE THREAT ZONES IN COMMUNITIES AND AND AND. EACH COMMUNITIES REQUIRED HAS A HOUSE A MITIGATION PLAN THAT'S PART OF THE GENERAL PLAN AND THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED AND THAT HAS A MITIGATION PLAN SHOULD BE A DRIVING FACTOR. HAS TO ONE OF THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES THAT COMMUNITY CAN FACE. THAT IN ITSELF BUT IS PART AND PARCEL OUGHT TO OVERALL OUR TRAINING AT EVERY LEVEL AN EMPHASIS ON EVERYTHING FROM ALERT AND WARNING. TO A AND THE SCIENCE BEHIND THAT WHAT IS THAT MEAN A COMMUNITY. BUT ALSO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S I JUST WANT TO SAY. THIS IS NOT JUST A GOVERNMENT SOLUTION THIS IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE NON GOVERNMENTAL BUT ALSO THE CITIZENS IF YOU LIVE IN A WILDLAND. URBAN INNER MAKES AREA YOU TWO LANE ROAD SURROUNDED BY TREES. AND YOU HEAR THAT THERE'S A RED FLAG CONDITION IN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS YOU NEED TO HAVE A FAMILY PLAN YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR VEHICLE PACKED READY TO GO. NO WE'RE FAMILY'S GONNA BE HAPPIER CAUGHT TECH INFORMATION AND BE ABLE TO BE EMPOWERED TO% MAKE ACTION FREEZE UP IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE. A GOVERNMENT SOLUTION SUB TOLD ALLOF THAT IS PART OF PARTIAL TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE INTEGER TURKISH. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR KILLER DUCE CHIEF PIMLOTT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. WE'RE GONNA START OUR SECOND PANEL. THE FIRST SPEAKER UP ON THE SECOND TO A. PANELIST LE CHIEF UP FOR SANTA ROSA FIRE DEPARTMENT TONY GOZER WHO I MIGHT ADD I THINK EXEMPLIFY PARTICULARLY DURING THE EARLY DAYS. OF THE FIRE OF THE ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT MENTALITY AN ATTITUDE I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS. SHE FOR VENTURA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT MARK LORENZ AND. I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU I SAW YOU ON TV SO MANY TIMES. THE PRESIDENT A CALIFORNIA MATCH BALL OF FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION JEFF CARMEN. AND DARE OSBY CHAIR FIRE SCOPE. GENTLEMAN. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR DALTON AND. HANNAH BETH JACKSON FOR HAVING US HERE IT'S A VERY VERY NICE TO BE HERE I'LL JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT MY LITTLE STORY. WAS GENERAL'S FIRE DEPARTMENT AND I SAW ON OCTOBER EIGHTH. WE DID HAVE ONE EVENT SANTA ROSA. FROM ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING UNTIL ABOUT MIDNIGHT I'LL TELL YOU THAT THIS. EDUCATION FIRES ON ITS OWN AND FOR STRUCTURE FIRES ON ITS OWN ONE OF THOSE STRUCTURE FIRES THREE ALARMS. SO DURING THAT TIME FRAME. THREE ALARM FIRE THAT WE BROUGHT A LOT OF RESOURCE ALREADY WE'RE ALREADY LEANING ON MUTUAL AID. BUT BEFORE THE TUBS FIRE EVEN. CAME INTO TOWN BOWIE NOW RIGHT AROUND THE SAME TIME IT WAS IT STARTED. SO I'LL TELL YOU I WAS A I CAME INTO TOWN LATE. GOT IN MY CAR I WENT TO THE THE MAJOR ARM STRUCTURE FIRE IN SANTA ROSA. MY HEARD IT WAS A FIRE OVER BY SAFARI WEST WHICH IS A MARK SPRINGS DRAINAGE AREA. AND I MEAN THE ESSENCE IN COMPARISON WHOSE OVER THAT WE GOT RICK IN VALLEY HERE WITH US IN NEW AND THEY'RE WORKING FOR US WE GOT SEBASTOPOL WE ENFORCEABLE AND LOT OF OTHER AGENCIES IN SANTA ROSA WORKING ON OUR FIRE. IN OUR FIRE WAS HE WAS MADE DIFFICULT BY THE WIND. AT MY PARTICULAR HOUSE WASN'T TOO WINDY AND DOWNTOWN SANTA ROSA IT WAS VERY WINDY AND I WAS BLOWN FIRE NEIGHBORHOOD SO THAT'S WHY I WAS A THREE ALARM FIRE. I RESPONDED TO THE MARQUIS DRAINAGE AREA AND TOLD READ COMICS TODAY. ATTACHED IT TO THE FIRE. YOU STRUCTURE FIRES UP THEIR ATTACH ME LET ME KNOW WHO'S WHO'S RESPONDING WITH ME. THEY HAD NO RECOLLECTION. HAVE NO THAT NO IDEA THERE WAS A FIRE UP THERE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY RECORD OF ANY STRUCTURE FIRE. SO THAT WAS A THAT WAS A RED FLAG FROM YOU THINK WHAT'S GOING ON IN OTHERS A FIRE OVER THERE. MY DISPASSIONATE DOESN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION PASSIVE THERE'S NEEDS TO BE SOME COORDINATION FROM THAT. DURING THAT TIME THERE WAS FORTY STRIKE TEAMS ORDERED. FOR THE CALIFORNIA ISN'T WHICH STARTED ON TUBS LA. OUR OPERATIONAL AREA WOULD SHE. DIRECTOR GIL DUDE SHE AND KEEP THEM ARE TALKED ABOUT. THEY ORDERED OUR OUR OPERATIONAL AREA ORDERED TWENTY FIVE STRIKE KINGS ON TOP OF THE FORTY. A WIN ANOTHER CHIEF OFFICER ORDER TEN ON TOP OF THE TWENTY FIVE. AND AND. ABOUT ELEVEN FORTY FIVE I RECALL THAT THE ENTIRE SANTA ROSA FIRE DEPARTMENT. AND WASTE AFTER I'M EVERYTHING THAT WE HAD SOAKED EVERYTHING IT WAS CROSS STAFF WE STAFFED UP. BY RESERVE ENGINES WE STAFFED UP LEAVING HAD AYE MECHANICS GO TO THE YARD AND AND. BASICALLY STEAL OUR FIRE ENGINE SO WE CAN STAFF PHAM. A BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING SERVICE SO WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD. AND THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THAT AT THAT WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY THERE WAS A FIRE IN THE SAME AREA NINETEEN SIXTYFOUR IT'S CALLED HANLEY FIRE. DEPENDING ON WHO YOU TALK TO IT TOOK TWO AND A HALF TO THREE AND A HALF DAYS TO GET TO SANTA ROSA. THIS FIRE THE TOES FIRE BASICALLY BURN THE SAME FOOTPRINT A LITTLE BIT MORE IT TOOK FOUR AND A HALF HOURS TO GET TO SANTA ROSA. AND I WAS UNDER EXTREME. WIND CONDITIONS AND AND THAT'S ON TOP OF THE OUTLETS FIRE WHICH NAPA COUNTY WAS EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S ON TOP OF. BY THE NUNS FIRE WHICH ISN'T ON THE VALLEY WAS EXPERIENCING SO WE HAD IT WE HAD A CHIEF OFFICER TWO ENGINES RESPOND TO CINEMA BALLOT FOR MUTUAL AID NOT KNOWING THAT WE. THE TUBS FIRE COMING AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMMUNICATION I WILL SAY THAT. BUT SANTA RITA NOT CENTER IS A BET THAT THE CALIFORNIA MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IT IS THE BEST. THERE THERE'S NOTHING BETTER. IT NEEDS TO BE MORE NIMBLE AND USED BORN. WITHIN TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE START TO RESOURCES. I REMEMBER THAT FIRST OPERATIONAL BRIEFING THERE WAS I LOOKED OUT OF CROWDS OF MEN WERE IN TROUBLE WE GOT FIFTY FACES OUT HERE I GOT THOUSANDS OF HOMES DOWN AND AND CREWS IT PAT. OUT THERE FOR A LONG. AND THE NEXT DAY THERE WAS A LOT MORE IF THE THIRD DAY HOLY SMOKES NOW WE GOT A LITTLE CITY HERE AND WERE ABLE TO DO WORK AND THAT'S WHERE THE VALUE OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM COMES AND. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FROM THE CITY SANTA ROSA FROM SONOMA COUNTY THE CINEMA VALLEY THAT THAT PARTICIPATED IN THESE FIRES. WE NEED TO BE MORE NIMBLE ARE AND THAT THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF THESE INCIDENTS SO WE CAN GET RESOURCES IN THERE AND REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IF WE WOULD HAVE A. PRE POSITIONED ENGINES THAT WOULD HELP TO THAT WOULDN'T SOLVE EVERYTHING BUT IT WOULD HELP AND WE WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THAT. ABILITY I CAN TELL YOU WHEN I STARTED THE SANTA ROSA BRANCH HAS CAL FIRE WAS ON THE NAPA SIDE. TOM I HAD MY MY COMMAND POST WAS IN AT THAT KMART. WHICH IS NO LONGER THERE WITHIN AN HOUR OF ME ESTABLISHING COMMAND AT KMART AT A BUILDING CATCH ON FIRE BASICALLY READ ON THE OTHER SIDE A KMART. AND HAVE ONE UNIT THAT I COULD SEND TO STOP THIS FIRE. AND ON TOP OF THAT HE HAD JOURNEYS MOBILE HOME PARK GOING OUT WE HAD A SAND ENGINES OVER THERE TO PROTECT KAISER WHICH WAS BEING EVACUATED WE HAVE CENTER HOSPITAL WHERE TO PROTECT BECAUSE. IT WAS BEEN IMPACTED BY FIRE IN THESE FIRES ARE MOVE AND SO QUICK IN TODAY'S WORLD. WE NEED TO GET MUTUAL AID QUICKER ON THE ROAD SO WE CAN MAKE THESE TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS. ONE STORY. AND FONG GROW VERY WE HAD A A BUILDING WITH. PRETTY HUNDRED HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WE COULD EVACUATE. SO WE PUT AMEND ONE WAY. AND WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AUDITING CATCH ON FIRE ANALOGY ORDER IF THIS IF THIS BONTA CATCHES ON FIRE YOU LOSE OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE. SO DON'T LET THREE AGENTS DID THAT. THREE ENGINES SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. OF WHAT. THE FIRE FOLKS DID IN THAT AREA. IN HOW THEY RESPONDED THERE WASN'T A LOT OF. THERE WAS NO EXTRA CAPACITY OTHER THAN EVACUATE AND JUST TRY TO GET AHEAD OF THIS FIRE COULD YOU PROTECTING. VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE CITY TRYING TO PROTECT LIVES SAVED LIVES AND BACK AT THE SAME TIME. BUT THEN YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR HOURS FORTY EIGHT HOURS WE HAD A LOT OF WIND CAL FIRE WAS EXCELLENT. OBRZEG AVAIL WITH INCIDENT COMMAND TEAM ONE I WAS UNIFIED COMMAND WITH HIM. HE'S A HE'S A GENTLEMAN AND A SCHOLAR A RUPTURED ON OF THE SAME WE HAD A GREAT PLAN. AND THEY DID IT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IS NOT JUST CAL FIRE IS NOT JUST A CITY SANTA ROSA'S NOTS KNOWN COUNTY IT'S EVERYONE THAT ONE TEAM ONE FIVE THAT WE ALL TRY. LIVE UP TO HIDE TRULY BELIEVE IT IT WAS SO THAT THEY HELP GETS THERE IS JUST DOESN'T GET THERE FAST ENOUGH FOR THE TYPES OF FIRES WERE EXPERIENCING THAT WE EXPERIENCED AND AND THE SOME OF ALLEN SANTA ROSA AREA WITH THE NUNS FIRE HAND. AND NOW THE TIMES FIRE. AND IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME SO WE NEED APPROVED PRE POSITION EQUIPMENT TO HELP WITH THAT. AND IT IS A WHOLESALE YOU NOT ONLY GET OFF TOPIC TOO MUCH BUT IS. WHOLESALE LOOK AT EVERYTHING YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA LOOK AT EVERYTHING VISITATION MANAGER BUILDING BECAUSE LAND USE ALL OF THAT. AYE BUT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO YOU TO HELP WITH MUTUAL AID AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY SO THANK YOU. THANKS CHIEF GOZER. CHIEF WARRANTED. WELCOME. SENATOR DODD SENATOR JACKSON'S MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS MARK LAWRENSON VENTURA COUNTY FIRE CHIEF. AND. IT CHIEF CUSTOMERS RIGHT THIS SYSTEM WORKS PRETTY WELL AFTER THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT THE REAL CHALLENGES IT IS DURING WHAT WE CALL THE INITIAL ATTACK STAGES SO I'M GONNA. SHARE WITH YOU MY EXPERIENCE A MENTOR COUNTY ENSURE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT RIGHT LOOKS LIKE IN. THE REASON I SAY THAT IS AT THE FIRE THE THOMAS FIRE WHICH STARTED ON DECEMBER FOURTH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I COULD I COULD HAVE OCCURRED IN A MORE PREPARED COMMUNITY YOU LOOK AT THE ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN IN ADVANCE WE HAVE. I'D A DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAM WITH A HUNDRED FOOT CLEARANCE ITS SECOND A NINE IT'S MANDATORY. IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE WE HAVE. A READY SET GO PROGRAM TO PREPARE AKIN UNITY. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY WHEN WE SEE FIRE WEATHER COMING WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO STAND UP RESOURCES AND PRE POSITION THEM AND WE DID THAT ON THE DAY OF THE THOMAS FIRE AND THAT MORNING. AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN DECEMBER FOURTH WE STOOD UP ADDITIONAL RATE RESOURCES THAT WERE EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OVER OUR REGULAR DAILY STAFFING. THAT'S FIRE ENGINES ITS HAND CREWS IT'S AN ADDITIONAL HELICOPTER AND PROBABLY JUST AS EQUALLY IMPORTANT IT WAS ALSO DISPATCHERS IN OUR DISPATCH CENTER SO WE. HAD ANTICIPATED THIS. NOW WHAT'S UNIQUE WITH US IS THAT MOST OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE AGENCIES CANNOT DO THIS THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. WE HAVE THE LUXURY BECAUSE WE HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CAL FIRE. AND WE ARE A CONTRACT COUNTY ONE OF SIX COUNTIES IN THE STATE. AND SO ITS NORMAL FOR US TO PRE POSITION RESOURCES. AND IT'S ALSO A NORMAL FOR US TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THAT MAJORITY OF THOSE THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE E. FUND. LIKE I SAID MOST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY. SO. SIX TWENTY PM THAT NIGHT THE FIRE OF ALL FIRES STARTED. AND I GUESS THAT THE BEST THING THAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ANSWER IS DID IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE RIGHT DID STANDING UP RESOURCES BY EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE. WHEN WE STAND UP RESOURCES OUR INITIAL GOAL IS TO KEEP FIRE SMALL BUT ON THAT DAY WE HAD SIXTY MILE AN HOUR EAST WINDS UNLIKE ANY WE'VE EVER SEEN WE HAD SIX YEARS OF DROUGHT IN OUR PART FEW BEDS ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY DEAD. AND. SO YES IT'S OUR OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP FIRE SMALL BUT WE RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT. WE CAN'T DO THAT IN EVERY INSTANCE AND SO. ON OCCASIONS LIKE THIS ONE WE HAVE TO CHANGE ARE PRIORITIES AND NORMALLY WHEN WE SEND FIRE ENGINES TO FIRE. THEIR INITIAL GOAL IS TO PUT A FILE A RING AROUND THE PERIMETER. IF WE HAVE IF WINDSOR TO SIGNIFICANT ARE SECONDARY GOAL IS GENERALLY TO GO OUT AND DEFEND STRUCTURES IN THIS ONE WAS JUST UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE WE'VE EVER SEEN IT TRAVELED. FIFTEEN MILES IN THREE HOURS FROM SANTA PAULA INTO THE CITY OF VENTURA. AND WHAT WE SAW OUR RESOURCES DOING WAS. NEITHER PRINTER CONTROL BOARD STRUCTURE DEFENSE WHAT THEY WERE REALLY DOING WAS ACTIVE RESCUES AND SO THAT GOES BACK TO DID WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEAT WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T PUT THAT FIRE OUT EARLY AND THERE WAS NO WAY FROM THE INITIAL IGNITION POINT THAT WE WERE. EVER GONNA MAKE ANY KIND OF HEADWAY ON THAT FIRE. BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES AND STRIKE TEAMS WE HAD ONE SMALL A RURAL COMMUNITY CALLED WHEELER CANYON THE FIRE WAS IN THERE WITHIN AN HOUR. AND YOU KNOW WE HAD IN THERE WITH AN HOUR WE HAD A FULL STRAIGHT TEAM OF ENGINES UP THERE. INITIALLY GOING UP TO PROTECT THAT COMMUNITY IN DEFENSE STRUCTURES WHAT HAPPENED AS AS A. ONE OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WAS EVACUATING. SHE CRASHED HER CAR AND AND ENDED UP BEING BURNED OVER AND DYING AND ENDED UP TRAPPING PROBABLY ANOTHER FIFTEEN CARS BEHIND HER AND SO WHAT ARE FIRE ENGINES THAT WERE IN THERE DID IS THEY. SHIFTED INTO ACTIVE RESCUE MODE. AND THEY WENT DOWN TO. EVERYBODY WHO IS STUCK IN THERE AND ABOUT TO BE OVERRUN AND IT WAS IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A A KINDERGARTEN DRILL EXERCISE THEY PULLED OUT ONE OF THE ROPES OFF THE ENGINE. THEY HAD ALL OF THE CITIZENS EVACUATE OTHER VEHICLES AND HOLD ONTO THE ROPE AND THERE WERE ZERO VISIBILITY. AND THEY LED THEM TO SAFETY UP IN A. A CORRAL THAT WAS JUST A PASSED THE ROADWAY. SO THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE AS IT IS MY GUESS IS THAT A NUMBER OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PERISHED HAD WE NOT HAD. PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES IN THEIR EARLY TO DEAL WITH THIS AND THAT THAT STORY THAT HAPPENED THERE WHEELER CANWEST'S WAS ALSO TRUE. IN THE CITY OF VENTURA THAT WAS HIT. I AM WITH A GIANT WALL OF FIRE THREE HOURS LATER AND WE HAD RESOURCES IN THEIR. BOTH FROM PRE POSITIONING AND ALSO. WERE ALSO VERY FORTUNATE IN THAT CHIEF OSBY WITH LA COUNTY ALSO CONTRACT COUNTY HAD PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES THERE AND THEY DIDN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A FIRE AND SO HE SENT HIS RESOURCES THAT HE HAD PRE POSITION UP TO US. AND THEY WERE IN THERE IN THE CITY OF INTERMITTENT TIME TO HELP PROTECT SOME OF THE STRUCTURES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. ACTUALLY PROTECT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE. I HAD THE INCREDIBLE FIRE GROUND COMMANDERS THAT SAW THAT THIS FIRE BEHAVIOR WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING HE HAD SEEN AND THEY STARTED. REQUESTING EVACUATIONS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE CITY OF VENTURA WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR. I'M. ED SAID IT WAS SUCH A COMBINATION OF SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS FIRST BALL. WE HAVE A REALLY WELL COORDINATED SYSTEM IN OUR IN OUR COUNTY WITH ALL OF THE FIRE AGENCIES AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS AND OUR OH YES PARTNERS THERE THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. ACTUALLY DOING THE REVERSE NINE ONE ONE ACTIVATIONS HIM AND THEY DID THAT EARLY WHICH IS GREAT. SO WAS IT WAS VERY INTERESTING THAT HIM AS A RESULT OF THIS THERE WAS NO LOSS OF CIVILIAN LIFE AND AS A RESULT OF NOT EVACUATING WE DID HAVE THAT. THE ACCIDENT THAT OCCURRED BUT. REALLY WAS REMARKABLE IN THAT RESPECT. PARDON  <u><c.green>OR ONE OF THE</c></u> THINGS SAID WE ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON THROUGH THESE HEARINGS HERE IS OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN SOME CHALLENGES WE HAVEN'T ORDERING AND IT'S INTERESTING WE'RE PRETTY WELL PRACTICED IN VENTURA COUNTY WE'VE EXPERIENCED. SOME OF THE DELAYS AND CHOKE POINTS IT A CORE OCCURRING ARE MUTUALLY ORDERING SYSTEM AND SO WHAT WE DO IS. WE GENERALLY DON'T WAIT FOR THE SYSTEM LIKE WE'VE. CHIEF CUSTER'S RT RECOGNIZES THE SYSTEM GETS. IT'S PRETTY EFFECTIVE AFTER TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT DURING THE INITIAL ATTACK STAGES. IT'S A CHALLENGES A CHALLENGE BECAUSE OUR DISPATCH CENTERS ARE OVERTAXED WITH CALLS COMING IN. AND THEY HAVE TO PLACE THE ORDERS INTO THE ROSS SYSTEM THE SYSTEM BY WHICH WE PLACE OUR ORDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. WHAT WE DO IS WE'VE LEARNED OVER TIME THAT WE DON'T WAIT FOR THE SYSTEM TO WORK I KNOW CHIEF OZ BE HAS RESOURCES IN CHIEF PROCESS WITH DALY CITY HAS RESOURCES AND ERIC PETERSON AND CHIEF MARDUK MARSHALL IN KERN COUNTY? AND SO WE PHONE A FRIEND AND WE WE GO OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEM TEMPORARILY BECAUSE. WE KNOW WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO IT RIGHT HERE AND NOW ITS WE MADE PHONE CALLS AND THEY SENT RESOURCES AND WE GOT THEM INTO THAT. SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME SYSTEM LATER. BUT I I THINK WHAT THAT DOES IS IT POINTS OUT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE SYSTEM IS GOOD BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE. WELL OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO AND AS PRIDE NOT JUST TECHNOLOGICAL. AGAIN WE WERE FORTUNATE ON DECEMBER FOURTH. HAVE STAFFED UP IN OUR DISPATCH CENTER. SO THAT'S A CRITICAL PART IN AND AND BY LUCK. YEAH I'M THE THOMAS FIRE STARTED JUST BUT BEFORE SHIFT CHANGE FOR US OUR DISPATCH CENTER SO WE ACTUALLY WERE DOUBLE STAFF WOULDN'T ALLOW ANYONE TO GO HOME AND WE WERE ALLOWED IN ABLE TO PROCESS THOSE ORDERS THROUGH SYSTEM BUT STILL THE SYSTEM SLOW. SO WE MAKE PHONE CALLS WE WE WORK AROUND THE SYSTEM. SO THERE SUCCESS THERE AT THE PRE POSITIONING SUCH A POWERFUL TOOL IT IT ALLOWS US TO GET IN AND TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTIONS EARLY ON AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SAVE EVERYTHING BUT. IT'S A IT'S A COMBINATION OF OF PREPARATION ADVANCE WITH YOUR COMMUNITIES IN YOUR CONSTRUCTION YOUR DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND WE HAVE AN ACTIVE PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAM IN OUR COUNTY TO. ITS A COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE THINGS BUT. RESOURCES IS IS REALLY WHERE CAPTAIN AND IT DOESN'T JUST APPLY THE WILDLAND FIRES. THIS CASE IN POINT. NOW THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MODESTY OF TRAGEDY IN THE MUD FLOWS. OH YES STAFFED UP SOME RESOURCES AS DID WE WERE ALL RISK WE STAFFED UP. AND URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM AND A SWIFT WATER RESCUE TEAM AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT TO DEAL WITH WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS CAN BE A LOCAL EMERGENCY. TURNED OUT IT WAS AN EMERGENCY JUST TO THE NORTH OF ASSN WE SENT ALL THOSE RESOURCES HAVE TO MANSIO. SO. BUT THE PREPRINT POSITION HAS SUCH INCREDIBLE POWER AND VALUE. AND IT'S. YEAH I WOULD SAY IT'S AN INSURANCE POLICY. IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT NOT NEARLY AS EXPENSIVE AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT BEING PREPARED THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SENATORS. COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME'S JEFF CARMEN ON THE FIRE CHIEF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND I'M HERE TODAY TO REPRESENT NOT ONLY. MY ACTIONS DURING THESE FIRES BUT ALSO THE OF USE OF THAT CALIFORNIA METROPOLITAN FIRE CHIEFS. I'M I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AS MY COLLEAGUES DID AND THAT IS THE PERSPECTIVE OF BEING A FIRE CHIEF IN CONTRAST TO COUNTY ONE OF THE EAST BAY. COUNTIES AND AND BEING RECOGNIZED AS A RESOURCE RICH AREA THAT IS TYPICALLY DEPENDENT ON TO SEND RESOURCES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH DEPENDING ON WHERE THE FIRES WERE. IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO OFFER THAT WE HAD RESOURCES STOOD UP RATE AGO WE RECOGNIZE VERY EARLY EARLY ON OUR OUR. OUR COMMANDERS THAT WERE ON DUTY THE NIGHT THE FIRE STARTED RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR RESOURCES AND WE STOOD UP RESOURCES ORDER FOR HOURS. AND. THAT WAS AS FRUSTRATING AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE COULD HEAR THE INCIDENT COMMANDERS IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES ASKING FOR RESOURCES AND WE WERE UNABLE THIS TO SEND THEM. UP OPERATING WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND AND THAT. WAS BASED ON TWO SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FIRST HALL ONE OF THE CHOKE POINTS WAS THE FACT THAT THE DISPATCH CENTERS WERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ADDITIONAL DISPATCHERS ON DUTY TO. A SIMBOLOS RESOURCES AS YOU HEARD A DIRECTOR GALLUCCI SAID IT'S THOSE DISPATCHERS RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSEMBLE THOSE STRIKE TEAMS IN THOSE RESOURCES AND THE. EARLY STAGES THE OF THESE FIRES AND THOSE PERSONNEL JUST ONE AVAILABLE THE SECOND CHOKE POINT IN THE SYSTEM IS AS AS CHIEF WARREN'S AND SAID. WERE OPERATING UNDER A FIFTY YEAR OLD SYSTEM. THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS AND AND BEFORE WE DEPENDED ON THAT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM TO GET US RESOURCES IN THE FIRST TWELVE THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS. NOW WE NEED THOSE RESOURCES IN THE FIRST MINUTES TO HOURS OF THIS INCIDENT AND THE SYSTEM JUST QUICKLY BECOMES OVERWHELMED SO NOT ONLY WERE THERE NOT ENOUGH DISPATCHERS. BUT THE SYSTEM CHOKE DOWN VERY QUICKLY WHERE WE WERE UNABLE TO GET AN ORDER. SO THAT WE CAN SEND OUR RESOURCES THAT WE HAD ASSEMBLED. AND AND OUR GOAL WAS TO FOLLOW THAT SYSTEM AS WE HAVE FOR THE LAST FOR ME YOU FOR THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AND AND NOT SEND RESOURCES WITHOUT IN ORDER. NAM WHERE IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW WHERE IT'S I I CALLED THE TRADE FECHTER I THINK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE LOWEST NUMBER RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE DUE TO THE RECESSION AND OTHER. REVENUE ISSUES AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE FIRES THAT ARE BURNING FASTER THAN ANY FIRES WE'VE THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN THE HORROR NOVEL. CAPITALIZE ON WHAT'S SENATE MCGUIRE SAID EARLIER HOW LONG WE GONNA CALL THESE FIRES UNPRECEDENTED WHEN WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THEM YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR SOON THEY'LL THEY SHOULD BECOME THE NORM. SO HAVE THE FEWEST NUMBER RESOURCES WE HAVE THE FASTEST BURNING FIRES THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN AND WE HAVE A FIFTY YEAR OLD SYSTEM TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THOSE BIG SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. WHEN THE THOMAS FIRE OCCURRED. SEVERAL HOURS INTO THE INCIDENT I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHO WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE? NEEDING RESOURCES BADLY AGAIN I HAD RESOURCES STOOD UP READY TO GO I COULD NOT GET IN ORDER IN THE SYSTEM. AYE CHIEF TO RE UNITE FIRE CHIEF ALONG BEACH MADE THE DECISION THAT WE WERE GOING TO PUT OUR RESOURCES ON THE ROAD. AND SENATE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT IN ORDER BECAUSE OF THE FRUSTRATION WE EXPERIENCE IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES AND AND LATER I FOUND OUT HIS TWO FRIENDS IN JUST TESTIFIED. THAT'S THE NORM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY'VE LEARNED WAYS TO GET OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEM TO GET RESOURCES MOVING. IN ORDER TO AGAIN TAKE TO GET THOSE RESOURCES AS FAST AS THEY NEED SO. I I'M I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY WE NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES HANNAH AND WHILE I WILL AGREE IT'S A MODEL SYSTEM BUT IT NEEDS CHANGE. FIRST AND FOREMOST THE PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES IS VITAL. THOSE THOUGH IT WENT WHEN WE SAY THE PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES WHAT WE MEAN IS. WE RECOGNIZE OUR PREDICTIVE SERVICES ARE GOOD SURE THEY CAN GET BETTER BUT WE KNOW IN ADVANCE WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE WIND EVENT OCCURRING FOR EXAMPLE. AND AND WE CAN IDENTIFY THOSE RESOURCES THAT WE WANT TO STAFF UP AND PUT IN THOSE AREAS WHERE WE'RE GOING I NEED HIM THE MOST. THOSE SYSTEMS KEEP THAT I'M SORRY THOSE RESOURCES CAN BE USED FOR SMALLER FIRES TO KEEP THEM SMALL AS AS THAT CHIEF TEMAS SAID THAT'S THAT'S THAT HAVE VERY IMPORTANT PIECES TO KEEP THOSE FIRE SMALL WE CAN DO THAT WITH THOSE. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SET UP IN THE SYSTEM AND WHEN THE BIG EVENT OCCURS THERE ALREADY WITHIN OUR RESOURCE ORDERING SYSTEM SO THERE'S NO PROCESSING TIME WE CAN JUST QUICKLY IDENTIFY THE FIRE THE NEEDS THOSE RESOURCES. VERY CRITICAL COMPONENT OF WHAT WE'RE HERE TO ASK YOU FOR TODAY IS FUNDING FOR THE PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES AHEAD OF THESE CLIMATE DRIVEN EVENTS. SECONDLY WE NEED TO NOT ONLY MOVE FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRE ENGINES BUT WE NEED TO PUT. ADDITIONAL DISPATCHERS IN THESE COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS KNOWING THAT WHETHER NOT THERE'S A BIG FIRE NOT DAY ARE GOING TO BE PROCESSING A LARGE NUMBER OF CALLS. AND IF THE BIG ONE OCCURS IN IN THAT CLUSTER OF CALLS SO WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE. THEN WE HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO HANDLE THAT AND STREAMLINE THE SYSTEM AND LASTLY I WILL SAY THAT THE RAS ORDERING SYSTEM. IT'S NO SECRET THAT'S A CUMBERSOME DIFFICULT SYSTEM TO NAVIGATE. I AYE AS IT HAS CHIEF PIMLOTT TESTIFIED EARLIER. IT DOES COMMUNICATE WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS IN OUR STATE PARTNERS WE NEED SOME IT WORKS. WELL AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN WE CAN WORRY ABOUT OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS NOW THAT'S MY OPINION SPEAKING FROM A LOCAL FIRE SHE'S PERSPECTIVE. WE NEED A SYSTEM TO GET RESOURCES ON THE ROAD SOONER THAN LATER SO. I'M JUST I'M SIMPLY GOING TO RECAP MY COMMENTS BY SAYING FIFTY YEAR OLD SYSTEM YES IT'S A MODEL BUT FIFTY YEAR OLD ANYTHING NEEDS UPDATING. PROBABLY INCLUDING MYSELF. WE NEED WE NEED MORE DISPATCHERS WE NEED. PRE DEPLOYED RESOURCES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO CATCH UP WITH THE ORDER PROCESS. SO WE CAN MOVE THOSE RESOURCES TO THE AREA OF NEED. WITHIN HOURS NOT I MEAN WITHIN MINUTES TO HOURS NOT TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS. AND AND THAT'LL BE THAT TOTAL AT TO TALLY OF MY COMMENTS TODAY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. DUCKS. GOOD MORNING. HONORABLE CHAIRS. OF COMPACT DRIVE COMMITTEE MONEY MR OSBY. AND I'M THE. CHAIRPERSON OF HARSCO BOAT SPEAKING THAT PERSPECTIVE. PER MINUTE. AND I WAS SEVERAL THE HATS TO NOTICE. FOLLOW FOR MY PARTICIPATING ALLOW MY SPEAKING POINTS. OF. BUT THE. POINT IS RIGHT I AM THE. THE UMP CHAIR OF FAR SCOPE THOSE IN OPPOSITION WAS FOUNDED IN THE SEVENTIES. IT'S THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL FAR FAR ENTITIES CITY CALIFORNIA THERE. COME TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. IT'S A COMMAND SYSTEM STANDARDS AND TRAINING WITH A CALIFORNIA AND WHERE ADVISORY TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. EFFECTIVE MATTERS THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT. THIS ORDER THIS WAS FOUND IN THE SEVENTIES IS NOT I DON'T KNOW ANOMALY AS IT RELATES TO WILDLAND FIRES. EVERY DECADE WE HAVE A MAJOR INCIDENT IN EVERY DECADE WE COME BACK TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM? SO THIS IS GOING TO BE ONGOING FROM MY PERSPECTIVE INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SWITCHING CAPS I'M ALSO THE REGION ONE COORDINATOR FOR REGION ONE I KNOW THAT. PROP PREVIOUS PRESENTATION TO TALK ABOUT THE. THEIR SIX REASONS THAT WITHIN A CALIFORNIA. AS THE FIRE CHIEF OF WATSON'S COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT I'M MOST THE REGIONAL COORDINATOR. AND THOSE ARE FOR THE COUNTIES OF ORANGES LOS ANGELES. A VENTURA SANTA BARBARA AND SAN LUIS OBISPO. SOME FORTUNIO TRYING TO SUPPORT MY PARTNER HERE. HOW ABOUT THAT FOR THE THOMAS FIRED? ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE LISTENING TO. AS THE REASON ONE COORDINATOR AND LIST WE HEARD ABOUT. THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ADDITIONAL DISPATCHERS. I'M FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS A LOCAL MISS THE POLITY. THAT'S A STATE RESPONSIBILITY. BUT AS THE RITALIN CORNELIA WE'VE TAKEN ON THE RESPONSIBILITY AND I SAY WE I MEAN MY DEPARTMENT. AT MY DEPARTMENTS EXPENSE. TO BUILD AN EXPANDED DESPAIR CENTER AND. DOING THIS INCIDENT STAFF ADDITIONAL DISPATCHERS AND ARE DYING. I NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE I FEEL THAT. AS WE HAVE FURTHER DIALOGUE THERE PRINCIPALLY BEING THE STATE'S DIME OF THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY. BUT IT'S DIFFERENT IN ARTICULATED WITH THOMAS FIRE DID OCCUR. IN THE SYSTEM IS ANTIQUATED AND SLOW AS MY COUNTERPART I'M JUST INDICATED. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE DO MAKE PHONE CALLS. AND I WAS AWARE THAT THOMAS FIRE pDEPLOY FOR THE RED FLAG A BIT BECAUSE WHEN RED FLAG WHETHER ALSO. BETWEEN MYSELF MY COUNTERPART BERMAN SHOWROOM I CAN'T PERSONALLY CITY. I MADE THE DECISION TO SEND FOR STRIKE TEAMS TO VENTURA COUNTY THAT NIGHT. AND THAT'S TWENTY ENGINES FOR MY DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH CREWS AND COPTERS. LA SEE AMELIE SENT ONE. OUR HOPES WERE TO KEEP THE FIRE FROM GETTING LARGE. BUT THAT IN THE CURRENT BUT CHILDREN'S AND DID USE THOSE RESOURCES TO SAVE LIVES. AND SAY PROPERTY. THE BACKUP PLAN WAS REALLY CITY TO BACK UP MY JURISDICTION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. THE NEXT DAY AREN'T. TWO ADDITIONAL FIRES ACCORDINGLY COUNTY. THE CREEK FIRE AND AND. ALONG THE TWO TEN FREEWAY. ALONG SILMAR SILMAR SUMAR. AND IN THE RYE FIRE UP ANDSENATE READER MORNING THE BORDER OF OF LA COUNTY. AND VENTURA. I WILL SAY THIS. IS THERE IS ARTICULATED EARLIER THIS IS THE PLACE TO ME BEING THE CHAIR OF OUR SCOPE FIRES ARE GOING TO OCCUR. I MEAN WE LIVE IN THE STATE IN A REGION WHERE FIRES HAVE BEEN OCCURRING FOR. USE A YEARS WE'RE GONNA CAR BUT IT'S MORE DYNAMIC NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE OF OUR PRE POSITIONING. AND ALL CLING STAFF IN RELATION TO THE TO FARTHER CANNELLA COUNTY. SO OF THE THE CREEK FIRE IN THE RIGHT FIRE. WE KEPT THOSE PARTS IN GETTING LARGER. AS AN EXAMPLE. BEFORE THE. CREEK FIRE. WE HAD A SIMILAR FIRED THAT OCCURRED. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. OF THAT SAME FOOTPRINT AS A RACER AMOUNT OF ACRES HAVE BURNED. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE BURNED APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED HOMES. FISHER TWENTY SEVENTEEN SAYING FOOTPRINT. BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE RESOURCES PRE DEPLOY PRE POSITION WE ONLY BURN SIXTY HOMES. I'M ON THE ON THE RIGHT FIRE THOSE ALONG THE. LA COUNTY VENTURA COUNTY BORDER. UNFORTUNATELY PEPFAR ACCORDING TO THOUSAND THREE. AND THE BURN FROM MY JURISDICTION INTO VENTURA COUNTY. IT WAS OVER A HUNDRED A HUNDRED A THOUSAND ACRES. AND OVER SIXTY HOMES WERE LOST THEN. BUT THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF PRE POSITIONING FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND REFUSES WELFARE. WE KEPT THAT FIRE UP TO BELOW TEN THOUSAND ACRES ONLY BRING FIFTEEN ACRES AND. VENTURA COUNTY. LAST TIME IT OCCURRED WE BURN ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRES THIS TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE OF THE VISIT RELEASE TO US OF THE. LOCAL MERCIFULLY AS FAR AS AUGMENTING STAFF FROM PRE POSITIONING. MY PERSPECTIVE IS THIS. IS THAT IN ADDITION TO LISTEN TO MY PEERS TALK ABOUT IMPROVING TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON. THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES BECAUSE THESE BARS DO OCCUR LOCALLY. I'M NOT GONNA SAY THEY'RE CERTAIN INCIDENT THESE FIRES ARE GONNA GROW LARGE. BUT. AS AN EXAMPLE AND LA COUNTY. FROM DECEMBER I'M FOURTH. THE DECEMBER TWENTIETH I'M WE WOULD EVEN RED FLAGS BAR. WATCH. FIRE OR. EXTREME FAR WHETHER. WE HAVE FIFTEEN FIRES DURING THAT TIMEFRAME. WE KEPT THOSE FIFTEEN FIRES LEFT IN TEN ACRES. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAD PRE POSITION UNITS AND WHEN PRONE AREAS. OR HIGH FIRE DANGER AREAS THAT WHEN WE HAD THOSE RESPONSES THAT WE HAD IT ALTERNATE RESPONSE THE KEEPERS FAR FROM ANY LARGE. EXCUSE ME MY VOICE IS A LITTLE BIT LEVEL CODE. BUT IN CONCLUSION. INITIATIVE TECH THE TECHNOLOGY. THE PRE POSITIONING. I CANNOT LEAVE YOU WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT. HAVING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE SYSTEM. I HAVE ONE OF THE LARGER MUNICIPAL APARTMENTS IN THE. ON THE STATE'S SECOND ACCOUNT FIRE. RELATION TO PERSONNEL TO FAR STATIONS. I'M AFTER DAY THREE OF THE FAR SEASON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE SUPPORTING FOR FIRES THE THOMAS FIRE. THE CREEK FIRE. THE RIGHT FIRE AND THEN DALY CITY AT ANOTHER ISN'T THIS GLOBAL FIRE WHERE WE SUPPORT RESOURCES THERE. BUT AFTER DEPLOYING ALL OF OUR RESOURCES WE HAVE A DEBT OF SIXTY ADDITIONAL RESERVE AND IS IN OUR DEPARTMENT. OTHER HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE STATIONS I HAVE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THOSE WERE ALLOCATED TO WILDLAND FIRES. AFTER DAY THREE WE HAD ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIREFIGHTERS. THAT SHOW UP TO WORK. BUT NO APPARATUSES STAFF. BECAUSE ALL THE RESOURCES IN OUR JURISDICTION IN OUR REGION. WERE. ALLOCATED INCIDENTS AND WE HAD FIVE HUNDRED FIREFIGHTERS THAT HAD NO RESOURCES THE STAFF SO. S. BET THAT NEEDS TO BE ON THE TABLE I'M I'M I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. HOPEFULLY THE THE THE. THE RESULTS OF THIS CONVERSATION AND THE RECOMMENDATION OF THIS CONVERSATION. ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED. I SAY THAT TO SAY THIS IS THERE HAS THE CHAIR FAR SCOPE WE HAD A SIMILAR CONVERSATION. WE HAD A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION REPORT THAT WAS DONE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. IN UNISON TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND NOT ALL THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED SOME HOPEFUL WITH A NEW. LEADERSHIP. AND NEW CHIEFS IN THE ROOM THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE COMMITTED TO ENSURING. THAT AS A BODY. WE'RE GONNA COME WITH SOLUTIONS. HAPPEN WITH THOSE SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE BEST PROP POSSIBLE. BARBARA TEXAS THEY DO THINK TUESDAY TO CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS FOR MANY MEMBERS.

THE COALITION THAT HAS COME TOGETHER DISASTER. READING AS FOR SAFER COMMUNITIES THAT WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR WE NEEDED TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE AND I CAN TELL YOU TODAY AS WE SIT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU AND AS THE PREVIOUS PANELS. I'M SPECIFICALLY THE PREVIOUS PANEL BEFORE ME SET BEFORE YOU WE ARE UNITED IT IS ONE VOICE THERE IS NOT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE AGENCY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ISN'T REPRESENTED HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY. WE. FROM THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS OF STEVE HALL. WE HAVE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES CAL OF CALIFORNIA LEGAL CITY'S FIRE CHIEFS ERICH NICKEL REPRESENTED HERE WE HAVE MY. SUCCESSOR HERE VICE PRESIDENT OF. OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AN ALLEGED DIRECTOR IS WELL WE HAVE THE METROPOLITAN FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION THAT IS ALSO PART OF THE COALITION WE HAVE THE CULT STATE. FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION CASF A OR A. HOPING TO BRING MORE. GROUPS ON BOARD EVEN AS WE SPEAK. YOU. ENCAPSULATED AT THEM VERY WELL OF SENATOR WHEN YOU SAID PRE POSITIONING. PRE POSITIONING FOR US IS THE KEY AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PRE POSITIONING WE BELIEVE PRE POSITIONING DISPATCHERS AND THAT COMMAND CONTROL CENTER IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT WE CUT WE CONSIDER THAT PART OF PRE POSITIONING. WE. TALKING ABOUT THAT CLUNKY NASA SENSUALLY OF THE EXISTING MASTER MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WORLD RENOWNED TO BE SURE BUT CLUNKY AND THAT'S PROBABLY THEBEST WAY TO PUT IT. WITH THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND PROCESSES THAT. ARE ARE TAKING PLACE IN AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT FROM THE CALLAWAY AS DIRECTOR. SHE AND MR GALLUCCI AND. I WANNA GET INTO THE DETAILS SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'VE ASKED FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND PEOPLE HAVE ASKED WILL YOU AND HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR SEEMS VERY ROUND TO ME. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT WILL LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR US DOES? A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO COVERING ALL OF THE RED FLAG AND FLASH FLOOD WARNING EVENTS THAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE KNOW THAT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WHEN WE ASK FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WILL COME OUT. TO PRE POSITION DISPATCHERS TO IMPROVE COMMAND AND CONTROL AND TO TIE WHAT DOWN ACHIEVE PIMLOTT DISCUSSED ON THE GPS SYSTEMS INTO THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. AS THE STATE IS DOING IT NOW MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS ARE ALREADY EQUIPPED WITH GPS AND pFAQ PART IS ONE OF THEM IT'S A PROPRIETARY SYSTEM. IN WHICH THESE RESOURCES ARE PUT INTO ONE SYSTEM AND SO THE CONTRACT THEM. REGIONALLY OR STATEWIDE AS OPPOSED TO JUST ON A LOCAL LEVEL WE KNOW THAT BETWEEN THOSE SYSTEMS AND THE UP STAFFING OR PRE POSITIONING OF DISPATCH. AND COMMAND THE CONTROL THAT WOULD LIKELY BE AT LEAST THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT LEADS US EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. POSITIONING AND WHAT DOES THAT DO. FIVE. ENGINE COMPANIES A STRIKE TEAM WITH A LEADER IS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY IT'S ABOUT FORTY SEVEN ON AVERAGE ABOUT FORTY SEVEN NINE. PER PER DAY. IF YOU TAKE THE PRE POSITIONING THAT HAPPENED JUST IN REGION ONE AND YOU HEARD FROM REGION ONE WITH CHIEF OSBY IF YOU TAKE THAT PRE POSITIONING JUST IN REGION ONE. FOR ONE DAY. IF WE WERE TO DO JUST THAT PRE POSITIONING FOR ONE DAY IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT EVENT IN EACH OF THE SIX REGIONAL CENTERS YOU WOULD LITERALLY HAVE TWENTY. DAYS. OF STAFFING. THAT LITERALLY WOULDN'T COVER. BUT PORTION EVEN A FRACTION OF THE AMOUNT OF RED FLAG WARNINGS IN A CLIMATE DRIVEN. A PREDICTIONS. EVENT PREDICTIONS THAT WE HAVE BOTH FLASH OF FLOOD AND A RED FLAG WARNING SO WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A LOT. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A NEARLY ENOUGH TO COVER THE EXPENSE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL INCUR. SOMEBODY ASKED WELL WHAT IS LOCAL GOVERNMENT PAY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TODAY MY BUDGET ARE NOT A CONTRACT COUNTY SO. MOST OF MY UP STAFFING OR PRE POSITIONING AND MUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SITE IS DETERMINED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR IN THE BUDGET CYCLE. AND THEY'LL PUT A FEW DAYS ASIDE FOR PRE POSITIONING OR FOR UP STAFFING WE CALL IT ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. BUT THAT COMES OUT OF OUR POCKET AND SO WE ARE FACED ROUTINELY WHERE. CHIEF THAT'S A RED FLAG EVENT COMING UP OR CHIEF THERE'S A FLASH FLOOD EVENT COMING UP WHAT ARE YOU WHAT DO YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO UP STAFF FOR AND I'M WE'VE LITERALLY. TAKE TURNS FIGURING OUT EXACTLY USING PREDICTIVE MEASURE SLICK FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD ON STAFF UP FOR ANY GIVEN EVENT. WE KNOW WE ASK FOR A LOT. WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT WE WILL USE WHAT WE GET IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM OR NOT LOOKING TO CREATE AN ADDITIONAL MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WERE LOOKING AT USING THE PREDICTIVE TOOLS IMPROVE PREDICTIVE TOOLS THAT ARE AT OUR. FINGERTIPS WE ALSO LOOK AT USING THE EXISTING MASS MUTUALLY ORDERING SYSTEM REGION. SYSTEM IN ORDER TO STAFF UP THESE RESOURCES. AND THEN. FOR YOU ALSO TO KNOW THAT. THE MONEY THAT YOU HAVE USE WHAT ALSO PRE POSITION A DISPATCHER SAYS WELL. WE'VE WE APPRECIATE THE TIME. THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US THAT WE ARE SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE WE EXPECT THAT VOICE TO CONTINUE THROUGH THIS BUDGET A SEASON AS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SPECIFICALLY TO PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES IN ANTICIPATION OF THESE CLIMATE DRIVEN EVENTS. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE. A GOOD MORNING SENATORS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE SPECIFICS ABOUT SOME OF THE MUTUALLY COMPONENTS WE HAVE IT COVERED. I THINK OF MY COLLEGE OF CHOSEN ME TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE. THEY THOUGHT I WAS RAN IN NINETEEN FIFTY WILL YA CAME UP WITH A SYSTEM. BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE A. GREAT SYSTEM BUT IT'S A REACTIVE SYSTEM AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE A PROACTIVE. I THINK THAT'S THE THREAD THAT WEAVES THROUGH THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION TODAY REACTIVE TO PROACTIVE. WE ARE MADE UP WITH LOCAL STATE FEDERAL TRIBAL AND MILITARY AGENCIES HAS SORT OF MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS. RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S ABOUT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIRE DEPARTMENTS ABOUT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS. WELL WE HAVE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FIRE APPARATUS. THE STATE CALIFORNIA ZERO YES HAS A HUNDRED SIXTY SIX OH YES ENGINES. RIGHT NOW WE CAN MOBILIZE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIRE APPARATUS WITHIN TWELVE HOURS. AND WE CAN MOBILIZE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED FIRE APPARATUS WITHIN THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD. BUT IS PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE SHARED WITH YOU. IT'S NOT OURS IT'S MINUTES AND THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER. SO AGAIN. THOSE WERE SOME OF THE FACTUAL NUMBERS A WE HAVE WITHIN OUR STATE THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY WE'RE WE ARE SMALL AS WE ARE. AND THE STATUS IS LARGE IT IS AS BUT. THAT PRE POSITIONING WILL BE KEY FOR US THANK YOU. YOU. WE DUGGAR DID DO EAT I'M I'D MORE HAPPY I I DO I PUSHED YOU AT THE BEGINNING BUT.

SHAPE ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE INCLUDING USE ONE OF THE. THE FOLKS WHO WHO SAY THAT TWO YEAR OLD UP FROM THE MUD TO THE DEBRIS.

I TEND TO MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN WE HAVE. ARE NOT WOMEN. UP THERE WITH A SAY THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE. COMFORTABLE EXPRESSING THAT HUMANITY IN I THINK IT BENEFITS ALL OF US TO RECOGNIZE THE THE DIFFICULTIES EMOTIONAL DIFFICULTIES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES NOT TRUST AS YOU FIGHT THESE FIRES. BUT IN THE AFTERMATH. YOU KNOW THE PTSD THAT THAT OCCURS I THINK THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT AS WELL IT'S NOT TODAY'S HEARING BUT. RECOGNIZING THAT YOU DO EXTRAORDINARY WORK THAT THE AND YOU'RE IN THE ADRENALINE THE SEARCHES PUMPING UNTIL YOU. ARE EXHAUSTED AND AND THEN YOU CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD I MEAN WE OWE YOU A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE BUT. BASS HAVE TO RIP REALIZED THE HUMANITY OF EVERYONE AND WHEN YOU SAY WE NEED MORE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. pIF WE GOT A QUESTION I'M SORRY CENTER HILL. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF. YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE EVENTS WHICH HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN. COMING IT AT A GREATER PACE CERTAINLY AND AND THAT ARE THE KIND OF THE FUTURE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ONE OF THE ISSUES AND AND A CHIEF NICKEL WHERE WE LIVE FITS. YOU KNOW THAT THE IDEA OF A WILDFIRE IT'S POSSIBLE CERTAINLY WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT COFFEE PARK WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTACKED HIS IT WAS. AND WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL IN THE WATERSHED AND AND AND IN OUR AREA AREA. BUT TO ONE OF THE ISSUES IN LOOKING AT THE THE IDEA OF A PRE POSITIONING AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE THE RESOURCES THAT WE WOULD BE. LOOKING THAT CONTRIBUTING ó ON AN ONGOING BASIS BUT ONE OF THE THREATS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A EARTHQUAKES. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS COMING. A HOW. WOULD THIS. FUNDING AND THAT SOME OF THESE RESOURCE CHANGES ALLOCATIONS HOW WOULD THAT WORK TOWARDS A. BETTER BETTERING OUR PER PREPAREDNESS FOR EARTHQUAKE CHO RESPONSE. IF IF I COULD YEAH I THINK THAT'S SPECIFICALLY THE MONEY WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IS TO PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PREDICTED EVENTS AND SO. WHEN WE THINK OF THOSE WE THINK OF THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE THE NOAH THAT COMES UP WITH THE AND HAS A VERY ROBUST. A RED FLAG AND FOR A FLASH FLOOD PREDICTION OF THE PER PREPAREDNESS IN FACT THE CHIEF CLERK EACH YEAR MISTER GORE DO SHE FROM THAT COLOR WE S. DIRECTOR'S POSITION. MOBILIZED A VERY ROBUST NETWORK OF. RESCUE RESPONSE TEAMS ESSENTIALLY REGIONAL BUT. RESPONSE TEAMS SPECIFICALLY IN THE MONTICELLO FLOODS AND SO WE CONTINUED OF TO TO BUILD ON. THAT CAPABILITY BUT I THINK THE MONEY WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND. A AND PERHAPS THAT WE COULD OF ADDRESS THAT AND THE OTHER HEARING ABOUT HOW THESE REGIONAL ATTACHED FORCES THAT. MR GALLUCCI AND FELLOW WE HAVE SAYS FOR A. GATHERED TOGETHER HAS MADE SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE SPECIFICALLY BEEN IN THE MOST RECENT. EVENTS AND THEN WE'LL PLAN. THE EARTHQUAKE COMES WHICH IT WILL AND WE AND WHERE WE WILL BE PREPARED EVEN A BETTER PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THE CITY'S TASK FORCE. IT IN THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR AND I KNOW THAT IT DIRECTOR GOING TO CHEER AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM UNFORTUNATELY THAT THIRTY SECOND OR FORTY FIVE SECOND WARNING IS AGO A LOT NOT. A LOT OF TIME FOR PRE POSITIONING FOR THAT BUT THAT IT WILL BE GOOD TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IN THE FUTURE AS WE LOOK AT IT. SENATOR PRIMARY AYE I HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING ON THE. SO NETWORK UNDER THE. SCHWARZENEGGER ADMINISTRATION AND YES WE DO HAVE THAT EARLY WARNING SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE THE BEAUTY OF THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY THE EARLY WARNING IT'S KNOWING WHERE THE SEISMIC CENTER IS OR THE CENTER OF THE EVENT. AND WE IS A FIRE SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO REACT BASED ON THAT WITH SOME OF THIS PRE PLANNING AND AGAIN AND GOES BACK TO HIS EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT SECONDS AND MINUTES AS COMPARED HOURS. ARE YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY CAPABLE IN THE STATE NOT NLY WITH OUR FEDERAL URBAN SEARCH RESCUE TEAMS BUT ALSO OUR STATEWIDE URBAN RESCUE TEAMS. OBSERVE THAT QUITE UNIQUE. IN OURS COUNTACH OUR STATE AS A WHOLE SO AGAIN I I THINK IF WE KNOW WHERE THE EPICENTER IS AND WE WILL.

NETWORK ADMIN. I DEAL WITH THAT FOR YEARS ACTUALLY SO THANK YOU SIR. OKAY.
