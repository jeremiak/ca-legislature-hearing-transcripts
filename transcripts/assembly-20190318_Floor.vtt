01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:21.430
REALITY IS.

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:23.665
AS MUCH AS WE PASSED MANY GUN

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:25.167
LAWS OVER THE YEARS --

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:26.968
MOSTLY PROHIBITING LAW ABIDING

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.703
PEOPLE FROM OWNING.

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:29.838
FIREARMS THAT THEY ARE

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:33.975
CONSTITUTIONALLY ABLE TO HAVE --

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.944
WE STILL HAVE MASS SHOOTINGS

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:37.212
LIKE THE ONE THAT HAPPENED IN MY

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:38.380

WHERE ARE NONE THE LESS?

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:48.523
SOME FOLKS WHO PROBABLY

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:50.092
SHOULDN'T OF HAD THOSE WEAPONS

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:51.960

HOLD OF THEM AND CARRY OUT.

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:56.198
SOME VERY TRAGIC ATTACKS AGAINST

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:57.933
OUR PEOPLE AND IN MY CASE IN MY

01:18:57.999 --> 01:18:59.034
COMMUNITY.

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:00.702
WE HAD A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD A

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:01.269
TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:03.105
AGAINST HIM.

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:04.806
HAD ACTUALLY TURNED OVER A

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.541
HANDGUN TO THE LOCAL SHERIFF

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:06.842
[inaudible]

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:08.310
AND YET.

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:10.645
SOMEHOW STILL MANAGE TO GET A

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.547
WEAPON.

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:15.684
STILL MANAGED TO OBTAIN IT.

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.652
AND USE IT AGAINST PEOPLE ONE

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:19.121
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE NOT ADDRESS

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:21.056
AND WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT.

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:22.657
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT BUT

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.693
THERE'S BEEN NO REAL ACTION.

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:25.927
MOSTLY FROM.

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:28.563
OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL.

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.699
OUR CURRENT ONE AND OUR PREVIOUS

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.067
ONE IS ENFORCING THE APPS

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:34.069
PROGRAM AND ENSURING THAT THOSE

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:35.570
WHO ARE PROHIBITED PERSONS

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:36.938
PEOPLE WITH FELONIES.

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:38.573
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.175
DOCUMENT A MATH MENTAL HEALTH

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:41.076
ISSUES.

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.744
GETTING THOSE GUNS OUT OF THEIR

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:44.079
HANDS.

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.447
WE STILL HAVE.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:47.149
LAST YEAR WE HAD TEN THOUSAND

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.517
PEOPLE ON THAT LIST WHO HAD NOT

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:49.851
BEEN VISITED.

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:51.086
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:53.121
APPS PROGRAM NOW IT'S OVER

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:55.223
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE.

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:58.660
LET THAT FACT SINK IN FOR YOU.

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:01.029
IT'S NOT ABOUT PASSING MORE LAWS

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.631
GOING AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.766
LAW ABIDING CITIZENS.

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.134
AND RESTRICTING THEIR ABILITY TO

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:08.403
OWN FIREARMS.

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:09.905
IT'S ABOUT GETTING NOT THOSE.

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.673
WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO CARRY OUT

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.042
THESE TYPES OF ATTACKS?

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:15.911
AND ENSURING THAT THAT HAPPENS.

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:18.280
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LONG WAY

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:20.182
TO GO ON THAT FRONT.

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:21.383
IN MY OPINION.

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:23.518
AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT SAYING

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:24.486
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:25.820
HEY YOU SHOULD PASS ALL THESE

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.522
LAWS THAT WE PASS WHICH HAVEN'T

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:28.356
PREVENTED.

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:31.793
GUN DEATHS IN OUR STATE APPROACH

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.195
AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR

01:20:33.261 --> 01:20:38.900

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:41.603

01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:15.722
