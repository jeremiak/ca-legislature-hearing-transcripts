THERE'S IN MY OPINION HALF A

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:51.970
REASON BEHIND IT THAT RELATES

PRO TEM IN THE SENATE TO TEAM-

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:36.587
I CAN'T TELL A LIE BUT I WAS

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:37.989
SCARED THIS YEAR- THAT WE WORK

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.290
IN A HOLD THE LINE ON EDUCATION

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:41.326
FUNDING FOR THOSE OF US WHO

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:41.959
WERE HERE BACK DURING THE GREAT

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:48.199
RECESSION- EDUCATION. ROUTINELY

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:50.635
GOT CUT WITHOUT MUCH THOUGHT

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.437
WITHOUT MUCH PRIORITY TO SOLVE

00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:54.672
THE BUDGET CRISIS BACK THEN IT

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:56.841
WAS DIFFICULT FOLKS WHO GOT UP

00:32:56.908 --> 00:32:58.409
AND TALKED ABOUT EDUCATION AND

00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:00.645
THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING THAT

00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:03.548
GENERATIONS FUTURE- DIDN'T WIN

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:06.084
THE CONVERSATION- AND SO THIS

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.819
YEAR WHEN WE CAME OUT WITH A

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:09.954
STRONG STATEMENT ON EDUCATION I

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:12.256
WAS OF COURSE SUPPORTIVE OF IT

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:13.057
BUT I WAS ALWAYS WORRIED THAT

00:33:13.124 --> 00:33:15.526
IN THE DAY- AT THE END OF THE

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:18.229
DAY EDUCATION WOULD SUFFER. AND

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:19.764
I'M PROUD THAT THE SENATE

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.733
BUDGET ARCHITECTURE ONE THE

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:23.201
CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT WAS THE

00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:26.337
RIGHT THING TO DO AND SO I

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:28.473
STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:29.006
EIGHT OF COURSE THERE ARE

00:33:29.073 --> 00:33:31.442
THINGS IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:34.712
THAT THE NO NO SENATOR NOBODY.

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:37.048
APPRECIATES AND A PROVES OF

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:39.183
EVERY SINGLE. NOT A SOUL OF

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.685
SOMETHING THIS COMPLEX IN THIS

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:43.988
LARGE BUT OVERALL THE FACT THAT

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:47.592
STABILITY. BECAME THE MANTRA

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.927
THAT IT WAS WE KNOW THEY'RE

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:51.963
GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT.

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:53.965
DECISIONS TO BE MADE NEXT YEAR

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:55.600
AND HOW WE FIND GOVERNMENT HOW

00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:58.336
WE FIND EDUCATION BUT THIS YEAR

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:01.172
WE CHOSE TO USE STABILITY. AS

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:02.740
OUR OVERRIDING PRINCIPLE WAS

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:04.609
THE RIGHT THING TO DO YOU NEVER

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:06.744
WANT TO SAY TO A SCHOOL THAT IS

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:08.312
DRAWING MORE STUDENTS THAT IS

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:10.615
IMPROVING- ITS ATTENDANCE

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.383
NUMBERS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GO.

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:12.884
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.287
RECOGNIZE THE ROLE THAT SCHOOLS

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:17.755
THAT HAVE INCREASE ENROLLMENT

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:19.991
HAVE- YOU KNOW THAT'S A TOUGH

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:21.626
MESSAGE TO SAY TO SCHOOLS THAT

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:24.262
ARE DOING WELL- BUT I THINK WE

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:26.597
ALSO HAVE TO SAY. WE HEAR THAT

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:28.099
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:29.967
DEPRECIATE THAT AND LONG TERM

00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:31.602
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT IN A

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:33.905
WHY ARE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:35.006
MOVING FROM RUN SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:36.641
TO ANOTHER. THAT'S A VALID

00:34:36.707 --> 00:34:38.342
QUESTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.411
NEEDS TO ADDRESS I ALSO THINK

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:41.879
WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS TIME OF

00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:43.648
COVE IT. COULD LOOK AT HOW WE

00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:46.217
FUND EDUCATION IS USING AVERAGE

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:47.084
DAILY ATTENDANCE THE RIGHT

00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:49.387
FORMULA SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:54.325
NEW MODELS. POST CODE VISIT

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:55.760

AND THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:06.404
SO ALL OF THOSE IDEAS. THAT

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:08.606
HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO REIMAGINE

00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:10.775
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:13.311
THIS IS THE TIME TO DO THAT RE

00:35:13.377 --> 00:35:15.346

FIRST CENTURY EDUCATION SYSTEM

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:24.322
AND NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:35:24.388 --> 00:35:26.123
CREATED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.358
WHEN WE WERE A FARMING IN

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:29.393
MANUFACTURING ECONOMY. THIS IS

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.295
THE TIME TO REIMAGINE IT AND

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.864
THIS IS THE TIME FRANKLY TO

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.866
INVEST IN IT THIS YEAR WE HAD

TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM. AND I

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:39.136
THINK WE DID THAT MUCH BETTER

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:40.304

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.787
HOW WE FUND THEIR FUTURE BETTER

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.623

00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:00.625

EDUCATION WE KNOW IT'S THE MOST

00:37:53.537 --> 00:37:54.005
IMPORTANT THING WE DO IS A

THE FRAMEWORK IS SOLID- WE'VE

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.669
MADE PROGRESS HERE AND WE COULD

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:20.237
NOT HAVE DONE THAT WITHOUT THE

A BIT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:44.662
SITUATION- AND I WOULD JUST I

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:47.131
WOULD SUGGEST THAT- WHAT WE'VE

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:48.098
BEEN DISCUSSING THIS HOLD

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.767
HARMLESS PROVISION AND REALLY

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:53.270
FOCUSING ON THIS QUESTION OF.

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:54.471
NEW SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH.

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:56.674
INCREASED ENROLLMENT AT THE

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.608
UNCERTAINTY CLOUDING THIS

00:42:57.675 --> 00:43:00.044
SCHOOL YEAR WILL REALLY REQUIRE

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:01.779
US TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AND

00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:03.714
LOOK AT THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY

00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:04.748
TWO SCHOOL YEAR. AND REALLY

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:06.050
THAT THREE YEAR PLANNING

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:09.119
HORIZON AND SAY. WE MAY HAVE TO

00:43:09.186 --> 00:43:10.354
ACTUALLY HOLD FOLKS HARMLESS

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:12.356
FOR LONGER THAN THIS I DON'T

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:15.125
WANT US TO LIMP INTO THIS VOTE-

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:19.163
THIS KIND OF. EFFORT TO DEAL

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:20.698
WITH THE UNCERTAINTY AND BUILD

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:22.366
THAT INTO THE FORMULA I THINK

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.801
IS REALLY CRUCIAL RIGHT NOW AND

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:25.336
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE NOT

00:43:25.402 --> 00:43:27.104
ONLY TAKE A LOOK AT. EXPANDING

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.306
UPON IT BUT REALLY TRYING TO

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:31.308
DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING. GRAY

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.844
AREAS THAT ARE SET FORTH IN IN

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:35.980
IN THIS BILL AND TRY TO GET

SPECIFICALLY THE REQUIREMENT

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:44.822
THAT- I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL

00:43:44.888 --> 00:43:46.824
SAYS. A SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:49.293
