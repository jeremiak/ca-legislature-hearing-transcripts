IMPROVED HEALTH PROBLEM.

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:11.954
I THINK THAT THAT BY A BOOK.

01:03:12.021 --> 01:03:13.256
AND THERE'S NUMBER OF ISSUES

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.391
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FIRSTLY AT THAT

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.359
WE KNOW THE NATURE CONSERVANCY

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:17.827
WE COMPLETE A SURVEY THIS YEAR

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:19.095
DETERMINE HOW MANY.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.630
OF YOU KNOW OF SEARCHING GAUGES

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:21.264
IN CALIFORNIA ACTIVE REVERSES

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.633
NOT AND SO THERE'S OVER THIRTY

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:24.500
SIX HUNDRED LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:25.368
THE STATE WERE STRING GAUGES

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.502
HAVE BEEN ACTIVE AT SOME POINT

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:28.404
BUT CURRENTLY ONLY 54% ARE

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.539
CURRENTLY ACTIVE.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:30.740
AND SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:32.041
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A HARD

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:33.709
TIME MONITORING AT IN A REAL

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:35.077
TIME DATA RIGHT TO KNOW WHERE

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.746
FLOWS ARE IN STATE FOR SO FOR

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:38.181

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:47.890
OUT YOU CAN HAVE ADVERSE IMPACTS

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:48.457
ON THAT BETWEEN THE NATURAL

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:49.892
ENVIRONMENT.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.494
BY KNOWING THE ONLINE OUTLAW

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:54.030

WHAT DOES US MORE ONE KNOWLEDGE?

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:16.319
A MINNESOTA ALREADY AFFECTED.

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:17.820
NO FISH LIVE SO IF THERE'S A I

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.388

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:23.025
SYMPATHETIC TO THIS --

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:26.528
SET OF CONCERNS AND I I YOU KNOW

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:27.196
THAT THE FACT IS THAT WE DO HAVE

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:29.798
A WHOLE SET OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:30.933
SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:32.467
AGRICULTURE SECTOR.

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:33.802
ARE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:35.137
EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE RESILIENCY

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:36.405
I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:39.007
IT'S BEEN SAID I JUST.

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:40.409
THIS IS A DIFFERENT BILL ON IT

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:41.844
ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC AND I

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:43.512
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW SUPPORT

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:44.546
BUILDING ON THE PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:46.114
HAVE EXISTING AND WE CAN ALL

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:47.616
WORK TOGETHER AND TRYING.

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:49.918
TO TRY TO DO THAT --

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:50.452
WE YOU KNOW BUT IT AYE I

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.554
CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT JUST

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:54.456
BECAUSE WE IF THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:55.724
JUST THEY'RE DIFFERENT ISSUES I

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:56.925
MEAN JUST IN LET ME I DON'T

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:57.526
AGREE THE IDEA THAT UNLESS WE

01:14:57.593 --> 01:14:58.126
TACKLE.

01:14:58.193 --> 01:14:59.127
THE PROBLEM THEIR ADDRESSING

01:14:59.194 --> 01:14:59.795
THAT WE SHOULDN'T DEVELOP

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:01.296
SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE OTHER

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:01.930
ISSUES THAT ARE AT THE HEART OF

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.232
THIS BILL.

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:04.533
I THINK WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.601
SAFE I THINK WHAT MY

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.469
INTERPRETATION IS THAT THEY FEEL

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:09.338
THAT THAT THIS FAVORS OTHER

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:11.373
PROJECTS OVER THESE AND I THINK

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.375
THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED.

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:14.476
FOR FOR EQUAL FOOTING I BELIEVE

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:16.411
I BELIEVE THIS IS ACTUALLY OUR

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:18.080
THIS IS ACTUALLY PROVEN --

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:19.114
THAT WORKING LANCE CANCER

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.049
QUESTOR CARBON CAN REDUCE

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:21.683
GREENHOUSE GASES.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.252
SO.

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.720
I THINK THE FEELING IS THAT THEY

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:26.054
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING PUSHED

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:27.756
ASIDE IN FAVOR OF OTHER PROGRAMS

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:30.492
SO HOW DO WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:31.693
WE GET A COMMITMENT TO WORK

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.829
TOGETHER TO TRY TO ALLAY SOME OF

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:34.329
THOSE CONCERNS.

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:35.998
I THINK THE REAL BUT WE'RE NOT

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:38.166
TAKING ANY THIS PROGRAMS AWAY

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:39.801
NOW WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING IT IT

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:40.469
FEELS LIKE YOU'RE PUTTING

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:41.303
SOMETHING IN.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.472
YOUR FAVORING SOMETHING ELSE AND

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:45.007
AND AND PUTTING THEM ASIDE

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:47.409
THAT'S THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.077
GET LUCK THAT WOULD CERTAINLY

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:50.646
NOT THE INTENT AYE AYE.

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.014
AYE BUT WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:52.447
WITH THEM AND HAVE A

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:55.117
CONVERSATION BE THAT'S NOT AT

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:57.019
ALL THE INTENT ALRIGHT WERE.

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:57.886
VERY IMPRESSED WITH SOME OF THE

01:15:57.953 --> 01:15:58.954
PROGRAMS THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:01.757
WORKING ON AND AND I THINK I

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.158
THINK THE WE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY.

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:04.493
TO GET TO MARRY A ME IT'S

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:05.761
ADDITIVE RIGHT IF WE IF THERE'S

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:06.929
A WAY THAT WE CAN.

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.196
YOU KNOW BETTER MARY WHAT WE'RE

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:09.464
DOING WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:10.098
I'D BE VERY INTERESTED DOING

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:11.633
THAT YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:12.701
THAT THINK THE STRUGGLE HAS BEEN

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:13.735
IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THERE

01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:15.404
IS SCIENCE TO SUPPORT WHAT

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:16.238
THEY'RE DOING.

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:17.839
THEY HAD THE THE ABILITY TO GET

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:19.474
FUNDING TO BE INCLUDED AND PARTS

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.143
OF THESE HAS BEEN HAS BEEN

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:22.477
REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT AND SO I

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:23.912
THINK THE FEELING IS THAT.

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:26.348
THAT THIS BILLIS ANOTHER BILL

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.817
THAT KINDA SETS THEM ASIDE AND

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.519
MAKE AND AND AND GETS THEM YET

01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:31.753
IN OTHER WORDS.

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.622
I BELIEVE WHEN YOU SAY PROVEN I

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:34.389
THINK WHAT THEY HAVE IS VERY

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:36.425
BEEN BUT I DON'T THINK THE BILL

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:36.992
REALLY REFLECTS THAT AT THIS

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:39.027
POINT.

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:40.629
SO SO WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER. TO

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.331
TO TRY TO GET FUNDING FOR FOR

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:43.398

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:34.434
ALSO IS THAT --

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:36.703

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:44.104
ONE THIRTY TWO THERE WAS ON THE

01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:45.672
BALLOT.

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:47.874
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:48.174
PROHIBIT --

01:50:48.241 --> 01:50:49.709
GILL NETS.

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.544
BOB PROPOSITION ONE THIRTY TO

01:50:51.611 --> 01:50:52.412
BAN THE USE A GILL NETS AND

01:50:52.479 --> 01:50:53.546
TRAVEL THAT'S BEGINNING IN

01:50:53.613 --> 01:50:56.049
JANUARY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:56.649
FOUR COASTAL.

01:50:58.218 --> 01:50:59.185
CALIFORNIA.

01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:00.787
I IMPOSE ADDITIONAL FEES EXCEPT

01:51:00.854 --> 01:51:03.923
FOR SO IF YOU CAN HELP EXPLAIN.

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:06.693
WHY IS THIS BILL DIFFERENT?

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.528
THEN EXISTING LAW --

01:51:08.595 --> 01:51:10.030
BECAUSE I THINK THAT MOST VOTERS

01:51:10.096 --> 01:51:11.731
MAY PERCEIVE HAY HAVEN'T WE

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:12.999
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ALREADY WHAT

01:51:13.066 --> 01:51:15.268
WHAT WHAT IS THIS ABOUT.

01:51:15.335 --> 01:51:16.369
YEAH BUT I'D LOVE TO TAKE THAT

01:51:16.436 --> 01:51:17.804
BECAUSE I'M.

01:51:17.871 --> 01:51:21.474
THE AND IN --

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:22.042
NINETEEN NINETY THERE IS AN

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:23.843
EFFORT BY DORIS ALLEN TO TRY TO

01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:24.711
GET THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE A

01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:26.279
BAN ON SET NET SO THAT THE

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:28.548
INSHORE GILLNET STILL THE SAME

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:30.116
BASIC PICKING TYPE TO GILL NET.

01:51:30.183 --> 01:51:31.785
AND UP THERE WE HAD A COMMITTEE

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:32.852
OF SEVEN PEOPLE.

01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:33.920
I WAS ONE OF THOSE SEVEN PEOPLE

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:35.555
THAT DROVE THAT EFFORT WE

01:51:35.622 --> 01:51:37.424
ULTIMATELY WENT --

01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:38.224
TO TO THE PROPOSITION BECAUSE WE

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:39.492
CAN GET IT DONE THROUGH THE

01:51:39.559 --> 01:51:39.692
STATE.

01:51:39.759 --> 01:51:42.195
AND SITTING HERE TODAY LISTENING

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:43.763
TO THESE PEOPLE TALK.

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:45.899
IT BRINGS ME BACK TO NINETEEN

01:51:45.965 --> 01:51:47.000
EIGHTY NINE IN NINETY ONE WE DID

01:51:47.067 --> 01:51:48.635
IT WITH THE INSHORE GONE THAT'S

01:51:48.701 --> 01:51:50.303
SO MUCH SMOKE IN MIRRORS SO MUCH

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.037
MORE.

01:51:51.104 --> 01:51:52.739
FAULT INFORMATION ABOUT THE

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:54.407
HORRORS OF KNOW HOW HORRIBLE

01:51:54.474 --> 01:51:55.842
WILL BE IF WE GET RID OF THESE

01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:57.010
ENSURE GILLNETS WHICH WE DID

01:51:57.077 --> 01:51:59.212
WITH PROPOSITION. ONE THIRTY TWO

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:00.380
THAT THAT THAT KEEPS THE GILL

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:01.981
NETS OUT OF THE YEAR CALIFORNIA

01:52:02.048 --> 01:52:03.383
WATERS OUT TO THREE MILES.

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:04.417
IT'S THE SAME THING ALL OVER

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:06.319
AGAIN BUT IT'S A IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:52:06.386 --> 01:52:08.455
A SIMILAR DEAR BOTH IGGY ARNETT

01:52:08.521 --> 01:52:09.556
OF BOTH THE GILL NET.

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:11.057
THE TYPE OF UNITS WERE TALKING

01:52:11.124 --> 01:52:12.725
ABOUT NOW OR THAT DRIFT GILL

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:13.960
NETS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BOAT.

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:15.095
THAT ARE TARGETED TO CATCH

01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:18.832
LARGER --

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:19.666
NEAR SHORE GILL NETS WERE TO

01:52:19.732 --> 01:52:23.536
CATCH SMALLER FISH INSHORE --

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:25.638
BOTH HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE.

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:27.373
KNOWN TO BE HIGH DESTRUCTIVE IN

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.042
IN DAMAGING TO THE RESOURCE

01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:31.311
THAT'S WHY EVERY OTHER STATE IN

01:52:31.377 --> 01:52:33.179
THE UNION HAS BANNED THE USE OF

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:33.546
DRIFT GILL NETS.

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:35.048
EVERYONE.

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:38.084
SO IF I CAN CLARIFY SO.

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:39.586
THAT BALLOT INITIATIVE

01:52:39.652 --> 01:52:39.886
[inaudible]

01:52:39.953 --> 01:52:43.022
CARE OF GILL NETS WITHIN THREE

01:52:43.089 --> 01:52:44.891
MILES WITH IN STATE WATERS.

01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:46.392
IS THIS TRYING TO IMPOSE A

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:48.328
CALIFORNIA STANDARD ON FEDERAL

01:52:48.394 --> 01:52:49.896
WATERS COMPLETE PLEASE HELP

01:52:49.963 --> 01:52:51.264
CLARIFY NO IT'S REALLY PUT IS

01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:53.800
POSING A A STANDARD ON A SIMILAR

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:54.868
GEAR TYPE USED IN A DIFFERENT

01:52:54.934 --> 01:52:55.635
WAY.

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:57.337
A DRIFT NET AS OPPOSED TO A SET

01:52:57.403 --> 01:52:59.873
NET.

01:52:59.939 --> 01:53:03.209
SO THIS BILL IS SUPPOSED TO ONLY.

01:53:03.276 --> 01:53:04.277
THE OTHER THIS BILL DOES NOT IT

01:53:04.344 --> 01:53:05.812

01:53:09.349 --> 01:53:10.583
HAPPENS OUTSIDE TO IN MILES WE

01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:11.184
CAN'T -- WE

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:12.418
CAN'T CONTROL HERE WE HAVE

01:53:12.485 --> 01:53:14.454
JURISDICTION OVER FEDERAL WATERS

CONSORTIUM THAT [inaudible]

01:53:20.193 --> 01:53:22.295
DATE ADDED.

01:53:22.362 --> 01:53:23.129
THAT THE FISH BUSIED THIS

01:53:23.196 --> 01:53:24.030
FISHERIES CONSORTIUM WE DO HAVE

01:53:24.097 --> 01:53:26.466
WE GET POWER. TO DO THIS

01:53:26.533 --> 01:53:27.834
ENTERTAINING.

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:32.539
I THAT HAD.

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:33.139
HOW CONSULTANT FEDERAL SOURCES

01:53:33.206 --> 01:53:34.174
ON?

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.675
BIGGEST HARPER OTHER MEMBERS OF

01:53:35.742 --> 01:53:36.209
THE COMMITTEE WISH TO ASK

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:41.748
QUESTIONS OF DUCK CHOI.

01:53:41.814 --> 01:53:42.882
THANK YOU ARE LISTENING TO A

01:53:42.949 --> 01:53:45.084
BOOK SIZE SO I'M NOT REALLY

01:53:45.151 --> 01:53:47.921
FAMILIAR WITH THE FISHERIES

01:53:47.987 --> 01:53:50.456
INDUSTRY AND UP PARTICULARLY --

01:53:50.523 --> 01:53:52.292
KID AT THE IN FACT SO.

01:53:52.358 --> 01:53:54.661
BUT THEY ARE LISTENING TO YOU.

01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:55.762
IDEA.

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:57.463
HAVE A QUESTION NOT REGARDING

01:53:57.530 --> 01:54:05.838
THE THE DROP WELL OF WAY THOSE

01:54:05.905 --> 01:54:09.008
ARE AND ARE NOW DOLPHIN.

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:10.410
CAUGHT BY IDEAS ARE.

01:54:10.476 --> 01:54:13.379
ARE GETTING AT THE FISHING.

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:17.083
IT HAS GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY --

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:19.953
Y. THE NUMBER.

01:54:20.019 --> 01:54:22.021
OUR IS GOING DOWN --

01:54:22.088 --> 01:54:23.923
THAT WOULD BE MY OF FIRST

01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:26.125
QUESTION NOT TWO OPPONENTS ARE

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:29.429
AND THEN NOT IF FOR THIS IS TRUE.

01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:32.899
DATA INCORRECT DATA THEN NOT WHY

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:34.367
WOULD THIS BE IT WOULD BE

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:39.572
NECESSARY OUT KNOCKED ASK --

01:54:39.639 --> 01:54:40.873
ON SENATOR I'M NOT OUT.

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:43.276
CAN YOU ANSWER FIRST THOUGHT WHY

01:54:43.343 --> 01:54:44.277
HE THANK YOU HOWARD LISTA

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:46.412
TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPROVED THANK

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:48.514
YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION --

01:54:48.581 --> 01:54:50.283
I'D ADD THAT THE MARINE MAMMAL

01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:52.585
POPULATIONS HAVE EXPLODED.

01:54:52.652 --> 01:54:54.921
IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT WE HAVE

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:56.389
GONE DOWN TO VIRTUALLY NO TAKE

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:58.558
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE P.

01:54:58.625 --> 01:55:01.561
AREA RESTRICTIONS THE SENT OF

01:55:01.628 --> 01:55:03.696
THE NET FLOATING ON THE SURFACE

01:55:03.763 --> 01:55:04.964
OF THE WATER.

01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:07.433
BY SOME FORTY FEET BY MESH SIZE

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:08.368
MANAGEMENT.

01:55:08.434 --> 01:55:10.770
BY AREA CLOSURE BY PINNERS WHICH

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:12.138
MAKE NOISES.

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:14.173
THAT LED THE WHALES IN THE OTHER

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:15.208
CETACEANS KNOW.

01:55:15.275 --> 01:55:16.509
THERE'S SOMETHING.

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:17.577
HERE THAT YOU SHOULD PAY

01:55:17.644 --> 01:55:20.013
ATTENTION TO AND THEY AVOID IT.

01:55:20.079 --> 01:55:20.647
SO IT'S WORKING WITH THE

01:55:20.713 --> 01:55:23.683
MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE WITH THE

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.418
BIOLOGISTS IN THE MANAGERS WE'VE

01:55:25.485 --> 01:55:25.952
BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS

01:55:26.019 --> 01:55:28.054
DRAMATIC REDUCTION.

01:55:28.121 --> 01:55:30.556
THAT THAT ALL SOUNDS VERY GOOD.

01:55:30.623 --> 01:55:32.258
BUT THE THE REASON THAT THE

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:33.293
METAL TAKE IS DOWN [inaudible]

01:55:33.359 --> 01:55:35.595
IS.

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:36.796
LOOK AT THE NUMBER SOARED FISH

01:55:36.863 --> 01:55:38.798
WERE CAUGHT IN IN AT THE HEIGHT.

01:55:38.865 --> 01:55:40.967
OVER TWO THOUSAND METRIC TONS

01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:41.267
[inaudible]

01:55:41.334 --> 01:55:45.038
TODAY. SEVENTY EIGHT METRIC TONS.

01:55:45.104 --> 01:55:48.308
SO THE THE THE THE ACTIVITY.

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:50.376
IT'S GONE WAY DOWN.

01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:51.344
AND SO YOU ABOUT LESS FISH

01:55:51.411 --> 01:55:52.145
CAUGHT AND YOU'VE GOT LESS

01:55:52.211 --> 01:55:53.913
MAMMALS CUTS NOT NOT THAT THE

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:55.748
KITCHEN NECESSARY THE KITCHEN SO

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:57.083
ME LESS MAMMALS PER SET.

01:55:57.150 --> 01:55:58.418
THERE'S JUST A LOT LESS SETS OUT

01:55:58.484 --> 01:56:00.420
THERE BECAUSE AS IT SHOULD BE

01:56:00.486 --> 01:56:01.988
THAT WHOLE EFFORT HAS BEEN

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:06.259
SQUEEZED DOWN AS IT SHOULD BE.

01:56:06.326 --> 01:56:07.960
I KNOW THE FOLKS COMPUTER BEEN

01:56:08.027 --> 01:56:09.862
STUDYING THIS AND HAVE SOME DATA.

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:12.231
SURE YEAH THEN I MEAN WE WILL

01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:14.467
ACKNOWLEDGE AT THE FLEET HAS --

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:16.202
MADE EFFORTS TO REDUCE BI CATCH

01:56:16.269 --> 01:56:18.204
AND PINNERS WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:20.707
AT REDUCING BEAKED WHALE CATCH.

01:56:20.773 --> 01:56:22.375
I'M NOT ONLY HAS THE EFFORT ON

01:56:22.442 --> 01:56:25.244
DOWN BUT WE ARE STILL SEEN

01:56:25.311 --> 01:56:26.913
HUNDREDS OF DOLPHINS AND OTHER

01:56:26.979 --> 01:56:28.781
MAMMALS CAUGHT IN THIS FISHERY I

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:30.249
THINK US UNDER ALAN GIVE YOU

01:56:30.316 --> 01:56:32.018
SOME STATISTICS IN THE BEGINNING --

01:56:32.085 --> 01:56:33.419
THE FLEET HAS MADE EFFORTS BUT

01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:35.188
WE'RE STILL SEEING THESE REALLY

01:56:35.254 --> 01:56:36.823
HIGH UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL THE BY

01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:39.292
CATCH FURTHER ONLY LESS THAN ONE

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:40.927
IN FIVE SETS IN THIS FISHERY.

01:56:40.993 --> 01:56:42.328
HAVE BEEN OBSERVED OVER THE LAST

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:44.364
TEN YEARS ON AVERAGE SO WE ARE

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:44.897
NOT.

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:47.133
CERTAIN ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.835
THE OTHER FOUR SETS THAT ARE NOT

01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:50.603
CARING I'M BORN OBSERVERS ALL WE

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:51.738
KNOW IS WHAT WE SEE THROUGH

01:56:51.804 --> 01:56:53.339
OBSERVER COVERAGE AND CAN

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:55.174
EXTRAPOLATE OR DO OUR BEST GAS

01:56:55.241 --> 01:56:56.909
AT ESTIMATING.

01:56:56.976 --> 01:56:57.510
WHAT THE BY CATCH IS IN THIS

01:56:57.577 --> 01:56:58.578
FISHERY SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:56:58.644 --> 01:56:59.979
ISSUES THAT ARE STILL LINGERING

01:57:00.046 --> 01:57:00.279
[inaudible]

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:02.815
GOOD.

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:04.150
SO WHICH STARTED CHOI IDEA HOW

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:05.618
WOULD ADDRESS DATA IS THAT

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:07.587
CORRECT THAT ONCE I SAYS HAVE

01:57:07.653 --> 01:57:09.489
VERY LITTLE.

01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:10.423
NOW YOU SAY THE US ARE STILL A

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:11.924
LOT.

01:57:11.991 --> 01:57:12.458
I THINK THAT'S UP TO US TO

01:57:12.525 --> 01:57:14.260
DECIDE [inaudible]

02:16:57.876 --> 02:16:59.244
WELL WE HAVE FOUND OUT IS THAT

02:16:59.311 --> 02:17:00.879
DEMOCRATS ARE RIDING JUST AS

02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:03.348
MUCH AS REPUBLICANS.

02:17:03.415 --> 02:17:04.349
IT IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:07.252
POPULAR RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES

02:17:07.319 --> 02:17:08.320
OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE STATE

02:17:08.386 --> 02:17:09.454
OF CALIFORNIA.

02:17:09.521 --> 02:17:11.823
THIS IS NOT A RICH WHITE DAMMIT

02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:13.892
REPUBLICAN PROGRAM.

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:15.460
DOES THE PROGRAM WORK.

02:17:15.527 --> 02:17:17.562
THE PROGRAM WORKS IT

02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:18.897
STRAORDINARIO EARLY WELL

02:17:18.964 --> 02:17:21.132
REMEMBER THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED

02:17:21.199 --> 02:17:23.301
AND EIGHTY STATE PARKS IN

02:17:23.368 --> 02:17:24.035

02:17:24.102 --> 02:17:26.271
ONLY EIGHT OF THEM.

02:17:26.338 --> 02:17:26.738
OR OFF AYE WAY VEHICLE

02:17:26.805 --> 02:17:28.206

02:17:28.273 --> 02:17:30.742
ONLY EIGHT OF THE TWO HUNDRED

02:17:30.809 --> 02:17:31.343
EIGHTY OR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE

02:17:31.409 --> 02:17:33.244
RECREATION.

02:17:33.311 --> 02:17:34.346
AND I WOULD ASK THIS QUESTION

02:17:34.412 --> 02:17:36.114
BEFORE I CLOSE.

02:17:36.181 --> 02:17:37.248
ANY STATE.

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:39.851
I THINK A BETTER IDEA BEEN THE

02:17:39.918 --> 02:17:43.254
GLAZER BILL IN WHICH WE IGNORE.

02:17:43.321 --> 02:17:44.489
ALL OF THE WORK THAT HAS GONE

02:17:44.556 --> 02:17:46.291
INTO THE OHP PROGRAM INTO TESLIN

02:17:46.358 --> 02:17:47.792
PARTICULAR.

02:17:47.859 --> 02:17:48.693
THAT INSTEAD OF AUTHORIZING

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.862
ANYONE.

02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:52.230
STEAL THIS PARK CAN GIVE IT TO

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:53.932
SOMEONE ELSE.

02:17:53.999 --> 02:17:56.134
THEY WILL ACTUALLY DO A HEARING.

02:17:56.201 --> 02:17:57.869
ON TESLA ITSELF.

02:17:57.936 --> 02:17:59.304
BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:17:59.371 --> 02:18:01.773
WOULD BE SURPRISED TO DISCOVER.

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:02.907
THAT WHEN THIS PARK WAS SET

02:18:02.974 --> 02:18:05.143
ASIDE IN.

02:18:05.210 --> 02:18:05.744
NINETEEN BUT THEY WENT TO THE

02:18:05.810 --> 02:18:07.312
LOCAL ENTITIES.

02:18:07.379 --> 02:18:09.280
AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:18:09.347 --> 02:18:10.382
OPPOSING IT PUBLICLY NOW SIGNED

02:18:10.448 --> 02:18:11.750
OFF.

02:18:11.816 --> 02:18:14.786
ON THIS PARK AND NOW WE'RE DOING

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:16.354
NOT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:18.323
I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS.

02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:19.858
BEYOND THE FACT.

02:18:19.924 --> 02:18:21.860
STEALING THE PARK.

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:23.461
OR TRYING TO STEAL THE PARK OR

02:18:23.528 --> 02:18:25.430
SETTING UP THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:18:25.497 --> 02:18:26.031
STEALING THE PARK WHEREVER WE

02:18:26.097 --> 02:18:27.532
WANT TO SAY.

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:29.034
SENATOR GLAZER MENTIONED THAT

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:30.468
THE OHP PROGRAM WILL GET MONEY

02:18:30.535 --> 02:18:32.671
BACK.

02:18:32.737 --> 02:18:34.673
WITH THE SAIL OF THIS PARK IS

02:18:34.739 --> 02:18:36.374
PART OF THE PARK.

02:18:36.441 --> 02:18:37.776
PERHAPS THAT'S THE MOST

02:18:37.842 --> 02:18:39.110
INSULTING PART OF THIS ENTIRE

02:18:39.177 --> 02:18:40.979
BILL.

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:43.415
I CAN NOT THINK OF ANYWAY.

02:18:43.481 --> 02:18:45.250
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE MORE

02:18:45.316 --> 02:18:47.852
DISRESPECTFUL TO AN OHP PROGRAM.

02:18:47.919 --> 02:18:49.387
THAT HAS DONE EVERYTHING

02:18:49.454 --> 02:18:51.122
POSSIBLE TO FOLLOW THE RULES.

02:18:51.189 --> 02:18:53.958
THEN TO SAY THAT THE PARK ITSELF

02:18:54.025 --> 02:18:56.428
CAN BE SOLD FOR LESS.

02:18:56.494 --> 02:18:58.430
THEN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE.

02:18:58.496 --> 02:19:00.832
WES THEN THE SPARE MARKET VALUE

02:19:00.899 --> 02:19:03.034
IN A REAL ESTATE MARKET THAT IS

02:19:03.101 --> 02:19:05.103
BOOMING IN AN AREA OF THE STATE

02:19:05.170 --> 02:19:07.672
IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE DOING

02:19:07.739 --> 02:19:09.140
EXTRAORDINARILY WELL.

02:19:09.207 --> 02:19:11.042
THAT WE WANT TO INSULT THE

02:19:11.109 --> 02:19:13.144
PROGRAM AND SAY LET'S SELL.

02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:15.146
AT LESS THAN MARKET VALUE NO

02:19:15.213 --> 02:19:17.248
THIS IS A BAD BILL AND I WOULD

02:19:17.315 --> 02:19:19.250
ASK DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO

02:19:19.317 --> 02:19:21.019

REALITY IS IS IT'S ALL IN THE

02:36:10.427 --> 02:36:11.929
CONTEXT WHEN THE PICTURE WAS

02:36:11.995 --> 02:36:13.430
TAKEN AND ALL OF THAT --

02:36:13.497 --> 02:36:15.966
YOU KNOW.

02:36:16.033 --> 02:36:16.567
THEY ARE.

02:36:16.633 --> 02:36:19.603
OHB GUYS ARE OFF ROADERS ARE OUR

02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:21.271
GREAT STEWARDS OF THE LAND.

02:36:21.338 --> 02:36:23.273
NOW FOR ME IT'S VERY TRAGIC THAT

02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:24.942
EVERY SINGLE YEAR AS I SIT ON

02:36:25.008 --> 02:36:26.210
THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE LAST

02:36:26.276 --> 02:36:28.145
FORTY YEARS --

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:29.813
I'VE SEEN THE STATE I'VE SEEN

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:30.814
MEMBERS TRY TO TAKE AWAY

02:36:30.881 --> 02:36:31.115
[inaudible]

02:36:31.181 --> 02:36:34.384
LAND USE FOR OUR OFF HIGHWAY

02:36:34.451 --> 02:36:36.120
VEHICLES IN.

02:36:36.186 --> 02:36:37.888
IT'S VERY DISCOURAGING BECAUSE

02:36:37.955 --> 02:36:39.423
WE DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH OF THAT

02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:41.825
SPACE AVAILABLE.

02:36:41.892 --> 02:36:43.093
YOU KNOW I CONSIDER NOT TO LOOK

02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:43.961
AT THESE PICTURES I CAN YOU KNOW

02:36:44.027 --> 02:36:45.896
AS AS AN AGRICULTURE GUY CAN GO.

02:36:45.963 --> 02:36:47.598
NO THAT'S THAT'S GREAT SPACE FOR

02:36:47.664 --> 02:36:49.767
FOR CATTLE GRAZING DO OTHER

02:36:49.833 --> 02:36:50.134
THINGS AS WELL.

02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:50.901
BLIGHT.

02:36:50.968 --> 02:36:52.202
I'M NOT SITTING HERE ADVOCATING

02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:53.771
THAT WE SELL THAT PROPERTY THE

02:36:53.837 --> 02:36:56.440
YOU KNOW THE CATTLEMEN'S.

02:36:56.507 --> 02:36:57.908
WE NEED TO KEEP THE SPACE THERE

02:36:57.975 --> 02:37:00.010
IT'S THERE FOR A REASON AND IT'S

02:37:00.077 --> 02:37:01.278
THERE FOR PEOPLE DIRECTORY.

02:37:01.345 --> 02:37:03.847
I CAN UNDERSTAND GROUPS WANTING

02:37:03.914 --> 02:37:05.716
TO SAY HEY LOOK WE CAN.

02:37:05.783 --> 02:37:07.184
YES SELL IT TO US WILL CLEAN UP

02:37:07.251 --> 02:37:08.452
WILL DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT.

02:37:08.519 --> 02:37:11.789
THAT THAT'S NICE BOY.

02:37:11.855 --> 02:37:13.090
SPACE EXISTS AS AN OFF ROAD

02:37:13.157 --> 02:37:16.760
SPACE. FOR PEOPLE OF RECREATION

02:37:16.827 --> 02:37:18.796
WE ONLY HAVE VERY FEW OF THOSE

02:37:18.862 --> 02:37:20.430
SPACES LEFT IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:37:20.497 --> 02:37:22.166
NEED TO HOLD ON TO THOSE.

02:37:22.232 --> 02:37:23.834
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IN AND I'LL

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:24.935
TELL YOU HAVE BEEN A GUY FROM A

02:37:25.002 --> 02:37:26.770
RURAL DISTRICT.

02:37:26.837 --> 02:37:27.671
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LOSE THAT

02:37:27.738 --> 02:37:29.439
SPACE?

02:37:29.506 --> 02:37:32.042
THEN YOU HAVE TRESPASSING ISSUES

02:37:32.109 --> 02:37:33.577
THEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE TAKING

02:37:33.644 --> 02:37:35.679
THEIR OFFER OF VEHICLES ROF

02:37:35.746 --> 02:37:37.548
HIGHWAY VEHICLES ARIANNA COLUMN.

02:37:37.614 --> 02:37:40.584
ON TO OTHER PEOPLE'S LANDS A

02:37:40.651 --> 02:37:42.352
STRONG AGRICULTURAL CROPS.

02:37:42.419 --> 02:37:44.788
STRAINED RANGE LANDS AND OTHER

02:37:44.855 --> 02:37:47.825
THINGS IS IMPORTANT. TO THE

02:37:47.891 --> 02:37:50.727
COMMERCE IN IN. TO ENSURE THAT

02:37:50.794 --> 02:37:51.395
THERE SOMEWHERE FOR THESE PEOPLE

02:37:51.461 --> 02:37:52.896
TO GO SEE THE SAME REASON WHY WE

02:37:52.963 --> 02:37:53.797
STARTED BUILDING SKATEPARKS IN

02:37:53.864 --> 02:37:55.332
THE NINETIES.

02:37:55.399 --> 02:37:56.433
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS TIRED

02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:58.068
EVERYTHING AND TORE UP SO LEGAL

02:37:58.135 --> 02:37:59.870
SKATEPARKS WE HAVE OFF ROAD

02:37:59.937 --> 02:38:00.871
VEHICLE PARKS FOR THE SAME

02:38:00.938 --> 02:38:02.339
REASON.

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:03.540
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE

02:38:03.607 --> 02:38:06.577
THIS HAPPENING ON PRIVATE LANDS.

02:38:06.643 --> 02:38:08.612
THAT ARE OWNED THAT ARE USED FOR

02:38:08.679 --> 02:38:10.280
COMMERCIAL USE OR ANYTHING ELSE.

02:38:10.347 --> 02:38:12.282
WE WE HAVE THESE PARKS THERE TO

02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:15.319
PROVIDE A SAFE SPACE. FOR OFF

02:38:15.385 --> 02:38:17.421
ROADERS TO GOV RECREATION.

02:38:17.487 --> 02:38:19.323
AND I'M SORRY I CANNOT SUPPORT

02:38:19.389 --> 02:38:22.192
TAKING THAT AWAY FROM THEM.

02:38:22.259 --> 02:38:23.360
MISTER CHAIRMAN CANCER JUST A

02:38:23.427 --> 02:38:24.962
QUEST WAS UNDERNEATH OF THE YES

02:38:25.028 --> 02:38:26.263
OF MISTER MCKAY I WAS GOING TO

02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:27.664
GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST.

02:38:27.731 --> 02:38:29.633
REBUT ANY THINGS THAT HAD COME

02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:30.434
UP DURING THE DISCUSSIONS HOUR

02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:32.002
HOLTER REAL QUICK IN TERMS OF

02:38:32.069 --> 02:38:35.806
THE USE OF THE LAND.

02:38:35.873 --> 02:38:38.909
IT IS INACCURATE TO SUGGEST.

02:38:38.976 --> 02:38:40.911
BED SUDDENLY BECAUSE THEY WERE

02:38:40.978 --> 02:38:42.713
UNDER PRESSURE.

02:38:42.779 --> 02:38:44.414
THE OFF HIGHWAY ROAD DIVISION

02:38:44.481 --> 02:38:46.550
DECIDED TO MITIGATE A CERTAIN

02:38:46.617 --> 02:38:48.986
PROPERTY IN ORDER TO APPEASE

02:38:49.052 --> 02:38:52.055
THIS LEGISLATURE OR ANYONE ELSE.

02:38:52.122 --> 02:38:53.790
LET'S BE VERY CLEAR IN THE

02:38:53.857 --> 02:38:55.659
LEGISLATION THAT WAS RUN LAST

02:38:55.726 --> 02:38:56.693
YEAR.

02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:59.029
IT IS NOT DISCRETIONARY.

02:38:59.096 --> 02:39:01.598
THEY HAVE TO MITIGATE THE SLANT

02:39:01.665 --> 02:39:02.599
SOLDIERS PASSED THESE PICTURES

02:39:02.666 --> 02:39:04.167
AROUND TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THEM.

02:39:04.234 --> 02:39:05.936
BUT HERE'S THE DEAL.

02:39:06.003 --> 02:39:08.005
IF THEY DO NOT MITIGATE THEN IT

02:39:08.071 --> 02:39:09.439
IS CLOSED.

02:39:09.506 --> 02:39:11.541
IT IS CLOSED.

02:39:11.608 --> 02:39:13.343
AND ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS I HAD

02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:14.578
LAST YEAR WAS THE IDEA TO WOULD

02:39:14.645 --> 02:39:15.812
MITIGATE IT AND CLOSE IT FOREVER

02:39:15.879 --> 02:39:17.414
WHICH OF COURSE MADE NO SENSE

02:39:17.481 --> 02:39:19.416
BECAUSE I'M A VERY SHORT TIME.

02:39:19.483 --> 02:39:19.983
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THESE PARKS

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:22.753
ANYMORE BUT THE MITIGATION IS

02:39:22.819 --> 02:39:24.755
NOT DISCRETIONARY THEY HAVE TO

02:39:24.821 --> 02:39:26.123
MITIGATE IT THEY DO IT AN

02:39:26.189 --> 02:39:27.724
EXTRAORDINARY PART OF THEIR

02:39:27.791 --> 02:39:28.992
EXPENSES DOWN ON THAT.

02:39:29.059 --> 02:39:30.761
THE SECOND THING.

02:39:30.827 --> 02:39:32.029
PROBABLY THE MOST DISTURBING

02:39:32.095 --> 02:39:33.664
THING I'VE HEARD TODAY.

02:39:33.730 --> 02:39:34.531
IS THAT SENATOR GLAZERS

02:39:34.598 --> 02:39:36.466
SUGGESTION.

02:39:36.533 --> 02:39:37.834
THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES AN

02:39:37.901 --> 02:39:40.570
OPTION AND NOTHING ELSE AND THAT

02:39:40.637 --> 02:39:41.138
HE DOESN'T HAVE A DOG IN THE

02:39:41.204 --> 02:39:42.239
FIGHT [inaudible]

02:39:42.306 --> 02:39:43.807
AND YET.

02:39:43.874 --> 02:39:45.509
IF LEFT TO HIS OWN DEVICES HE

02:39:45.575 --> 02:39:47.811
WOULD ALREADY SELL THE LAND TO

02:39:47.878 --> 02:39:50.814
SOMEBODY WHO'S IN LINE TO BUY IT.

02:39:50.881 --> 02:39:52.883
THE LAND CAN BE PURCHASED BY A

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:55.152
NONPUBLIC ENTITY FETCHED THAT'S

02:39:55.218 --> 02:39:56.119
TRUE.

02:39:56.186 --> 02:39:58.121
IT WILL BE OPEN LAND AND THAT IS

02:39:58.188 --> 02:39:59.856
OF VALUE TO SOME FOLKS.

02:39:59.923 --> 02:40:01.158
BUT THE TRUTH IS IT WILL NOT BE

02:40:01.224 --> 02:40:04.494
ALLOWED TO BE USED FOR ANY OFF

02:40:04.561 --> 02:40:06.530
HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION FOR

02:40:06.596 --> 02:40:08.899
WHICH IT WAS INITIALLY INTENDED.

02:40:08.966 --> 02:40:10.968
MY SUGGESTION AGAIN IS THAT WE

02:40:11.034 --> 02:40:12.369
DO A HEARING ON THIS.

02:40:12.436 --> 02:40:14.805
AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT TO

02:40:14.871 --> 02:40:17.641
SAY THAT THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL

02:40:17.708 --> 02:40:18.542
ALONE.

02:40:18.608 --> 02:40:21.378
IS INACCURATE IT IS A STATE PARK

02:40:21.445 --> 02:40:22.746
ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW EVERY

02:40:22.813 --> 02:40:25.148
SINGLE DISTRICT NOW TO DECIDE

02:40:25.215 --> 02:40:26.450
HOW STATE PROPERTIES ARE GOING

02:40:26.516 --> 02:40:29.252
TO BE USED.

02:40:29.319 --> 02:40:30.053
THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS

02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:31.989
SOMEONE MUCH SMARTER THAN E WHO

02:40:32.055 --> 02:40:32.990
HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A

02:40:33.056 --> 02:40:34.424
LONG TIME.

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:35.359
HAS MADE A SUGGESTION THAT I

02:40:35.425 --> 02:40:37.995
THINK MAKES SENSE. TO BRING

02:40:38.061 --> 02:40:39.596
PARTIES TOGETHER IN A HEARING IN

02:40:39.663 --> 02:40:41.765
A DISCUSSION AND TALK THAT

02:40:41.832 --> 02:40:43.700
PERHAPS THERE'S MULTI USE THAT

02:40:43.767 --> 02:40:45.602
CAN BE DONE ON THIS PROPERTY.

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:48.672
LET'S START FINDING RESOLUTION

02:40:48.739 --> 02:40:50.207
LET'S STOP THE IDEA OF THE

02:40:50.273 --> 02:40:51.908
FIGHTING BUT LET'S DO IT IN A

02:40:51.975 --> 02:40:53.777
WAY THAT IS NOT PUNITIVE TO THE

02:40:53.844 --> 02:40:55.078
OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE DIVISION

02:40:55.145 --> 02:40:56.213
ONLY EIGHT PARKS FOLKS ONLY

02:40:56.279 --> 02:40:58.248
EIGHT PARKS.

02:40:58.315 --> 02:40:59.416
AND IF YOU ALLOW EACH SENATOR

02:40:59.483 --> 02:41:01.685
EACH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO DECIDE

02:41:01.752 --> 02:41:02.319
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SELL STATE

02:41:02.386 --> 02:41:04.087
PROPERTY.

02:41:04.154 --> 02:41:05.088
BEFORE YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA SIDE

02:41:05.155 --> 02:41:05.689
THAT SHERIFF'S INTO A HIGHWAY

02:41:05.756 --> 02:41:07.224
PATROLMAN FIRST.

02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:08.558
THE YOU KNOW FOR GONNA LOSE THE

02:41:08.625 --> 02:41:10.093
REASONS THAT WE HAVE THESE

02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:12.963
DISTINCTIONS IN THE BEGINNING.

02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:15.499
I THANK YOU MR MCHALE --

02:41:15.565 --> 02:41:17.300
AND NOT SEE ANY OTHER --

02:41:17.367 --> 02:41:18.635
COMMENTS --

02:41:18.702 --> 02:41:20.437
I WILL JUST SAY YOU KNOW IT IS

02:41:20.504 --> 02:41:21.004
THE SECOND YEAR THAT I KNOW

02:41:21.071 --> 02:41:23.373
WE'VE HAD THE SAME ISSUE MAYBE A

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:25.008
DIFFERENT BILL THAT SAME ISSUE --

02:41:25.075 --> 02:41:26.777
IN THIS COMMITTEE AND IT SEEMS

02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:28.779
LIKE THERE ARE VERY STRONG.

02:41:28.845 --> 02:41:31.148
YOU KNOW STRONGLY HELD VIEWS IN

02:41:31.214 --> 02:41:31.748
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY OBVIOUSLY

02:41:31.815 --> 02:41:33.183
WERE.

02:41:33.250 --> 02:41:34.618
YOU KNOW MOST OF US DON'T LIVE

02:41:34.684 --> 02:41:36.620
IN THAT DISTRICT RIGHT DOWN AND

02:41:36.686 --> 02:41:38.588
YOU ARE ARE KIND OF BEING ASKED

02:41:38.655 --> 02:41:38.855
TO MAYBE.

02:41:38.922 --> 02:41:40.924
ASCERTAIN OR MAKE A DECISION

02:41:40.991 --> 02:41:42.426
THAT'S YOU KNOW.

02:41:42.492 --> 02:41:43.860
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE IN THAT

02:41:43.927 --> 02:41:45.662
AREA VERY --

02:41:45.729 --> 02:41:48.098
PASSIONATE ABOUT RIGHT AND SO

02:41:48.165 --> 02:41:49.332
THAT DOES MAKE KIND OF TOUGH

02:41:49.399 --> 02:41:50.734
MAYBE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A

02:41:50.801 --> 02:41:52.936
HEARING IN THE FUTURE MIGHT HELP

02:41:53.003 --> 02:41:54.071
PROVIDE SOME MORE.

02:41:54.137 --> 02:41:55.972
CLARITY AND AND PROVIDE A LOT

02:41:56.039 --> 02:41:58.175
MORE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT VIEWS

02:41:58.241 --> 02:42:00.177
ASSOCIATE HERE ONE THING I WOULD

02:42:00.243 --> 02:42:01.912
JUST SAY AS SENATORS.

02:42:01.978 --> 02:42:03.213
BECAUSE IT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE

02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:05.015
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT.

02:42:05.082 --> 02:42:08.552
YOU WANT TO GIVE THIS OPTION --

02:42:08.618 --> 02:42:09.886
AT NIGHT I THINK I HEARD THAT

02:42:09.953 --> 02:42:11.221
PRETTY CLEARLY FROM YOUR FROM

02:42:11.288 --> 02:42:12.722
YOUR TESTIMONY.

02:42:12.789 --> 02:42:13.857
BUT I THINK THE CONCERN FROM THE

02:42:13.924 --> 02:42:15.759
O. H. V. SIDE IS WHAT THIS IS

02:42:15.826 --> 02:42:17.360
SOLD FOR LESS THAN FAIR MARKET

02:42:17.427 --> 02:42:19.029
VALUE WE DON'T RECOUP.

02:42:19.096 --> 02:42:21.431
THE MONEY TO OH HV WHICH IS THE

02:42:21.498 --> 02:42:22.566
WHOLE POINT OF HAVING NO WAY TO

02:42:22.632 --> 02:42:24.201
BE IS TO PROVIDE THE SPACES AND

02:42:24.267 --> 02:42:25.802
TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS.

02:42:25.869 --> 02:42:28.905
AND THIS PLACE FOR THE OFF A YOU

02:42:28.972 --> 02:42:31.842
OFF OFF ROAD VEHICLES --

02:42:31.908 --> 02:42:32.742
THEN WE CAN'T REALLY GET THAT

02:42:32.809 --> 02:42:34.177
REPLACEMENT OR FIND SOME OTHER

02:42:34.244 --> 02:42:36.246

02:42:36.313 --> 02:42:37.514
OF THEIR THAT LANGUAGES YOU

02:42:37.581 --> 02:42:39.749

AND I THINK YOU MAKE AN

02:42:48.525 --> 02:42:49.593
ASSUMPTION THAT I THINK IS A

02:42:49.659 --> 02:42:51.461
FAULTY ONE THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN

02:42:51.528 --> 02:42:52.496
CHARGE OF THIS CHOICE ARE THE

02:42:52.562 --> 02:42:54.431
PEOPLE THAT.

02:42:54.498 --> 02:42:55.699

HIV IS THAT IS THAT THE KEY TO

02:43:00.770 --> 02:43:01.204
THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE

02:43:01.271 --> 02:43:03.773

SUPPORT THE SPORTS.

02:43:05.375 --> 02:43:06.276
AND THEY'RE DIRECTLY ON THE

02:43:06.343 --> 02:43:07.210
FRONT LAWN OF THESE CHOICES OF

02:43:07.277 --> 02:43:08.378
WHAT. TO DAG WHAT THEY DO

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:10.480
TOMORROW.

02:43:10.547 --> 02:43:11.681
AND THAT IT THAT IT DID NOT

02:43:11.748 --> 02:43:13.116
TRUST THEIR JUDGMENT ABOUT

02:43:13.183 --> 02:43:14.684
WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

02:43:14.751 --> 02:43:16.052
OFF ROAD I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

02:43:16.119 --> 02:43:17.254
THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT

02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:18.488
GOING TO GET THE VALUE THAT THEY

02:43:18.555 --> 02:43:20.257
WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN THEY

02:43:20.323 --> 02:43:21.024
WERE GONNA TAKE THAT INTO

02:43:21.091 --> 02:43:22.626
ACCOUNT IN THE CHOICE THAT THEY

02:43:22.692 --> 02:43:23.493

02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:24.261

CONTINUE THE LITIGATION AND THE

02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:31.902
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE BEING

02:43:31.968 --> 02:43:33.537
SPENT TO FIGHT THIS THING. FOR

02:43:33.603 --> 02:43:35.405
THE YEARS PASSED IN THE YEARS IN

02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:36.072
THE FUTURE THEY COULD MAKE THAT

02:43:36.139 --> 02:43:36.840
CHOICE.

02:43:36.907 --> 02:43:39.009

AND I'M SAYING THAT IF YOU LOVE

02:43:40.644 --> 02:43:41.645
OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE.

02:43:41.711 --> 02:43:45.081

02:44:00.030 --> 02:44:01.164
AND CREATED.

02:44:01.231 --> 02:44:02.265
AND RATHER THAN BEING IN THIS

02:44:02.332 --> 02:44:04.568
QUAGMIRE IN THE MUD WHERE

02:44:04.634 --> 02:44:06.002
NOTHING HAPPENS AND THAT'S

02:44:06.069 --> 02:44:06.970
THAT'S WHERE I THINK ASSEMBLY

02:44:07.037 --> 02:44:08.238
WOMAN BAKER AND I'VE GOTTEN IN

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:09.706
THIS SPACE IS THAT.

02:44:09.773 --> 02:44:11.074
THEY'VE BEEN THE MUD WRESTLING

02:44:11.141 --> 02:44:12.542
FOR A LONG TIME AND NOTHING'S

02:44:12.609 --> 02:44:14.077
COME OUT OF IT AND SHE'S NOT OP

02:44:14.144 --> 02:44:16.413
AGAINST OFF ROAD USE SONORA LIFE

02:44:16.479 --> 02:44:17.013
IT'S DONE AND MANAGE CORRECTLY

02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:17.314
[inaudible]

02:44:17.380 --> 02:44:19.883
BUT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE THE

02:44:19.950 --> 02:44:21.318
OPTION IF YOU THINK THAT THIS IS

02:44:21.384 --> 02:44:22.719
GOING NOWHERE THAT'S REALLY THE

02:44:22.786 --> 02:44:24.120
PURPOSE OF THE BILL THAT

02:44:24.187 --> 02:44:25.889
DISTRACTING CHAIR IN.

02:44:25.956 --> 02:44:27.457
A FAIR POINT YOU KNOW THAT THEY

02:44:27.524 --> 02:44:29.359
WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION --

02:44:29.426 --> 02:44:31.461
YEAH I THINK THAT THEY ARE THERE.

02:44:31.528 --> 02:44:32.529
YA YOU WILL BE WILL WHO'S ON

02:44:32.596 --> 02:44:34.064

KNOW IT'S ARE IT'S A GOVERNMENT

02:44:35.365 --> 02:44:36.833
APPOINTED BOARD COULD CHANGE

02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:38.001
OVER TIME.

02:44:38.068 --> 02:44:39.536
AND THEN I THINK THE BIGGER THE

02:44:39.603 --> 02:44:40.604
BIGGER POINT MADE BY SOME OR

02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:42.005
HARPER IS WE ARE THIS IS PUBLIC

TO SELL PUBLIC PROPERTY YOU KNOW

02:44:49.079 --> 02:44:50.513

02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:52.716
CONCERNS BUT I KNOW WE'VE.

02:44:52.782 --> 02:44:53.550

FEW OF THOSE BARRIERS ARE THIS

03:11:02.684 --> 03:11:03.985

UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

03:11:17.699 --> 03:11:19.167
AND IT ENTERED A CONSENT DECREE.

03:11:19.234 --> 03:11:21.036
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE CONTRARY TO

03:11:21.102 --> 03:11:22.704
FEDERAL LAW EXPOSING CALIFORNIA

03:11:22.771 --> 03:11:24.339
TOO EXPENSIVE LITIGATION AND IT

03:11:24.406 --> 03:11:26.007

03:11:26.074 --> 03:11:26.908
THE BILL IGNORES THE

03:11:26.975 --> 03:11:28.376
CONSERVATION BENEFITS OF HUNTING

03:11:28.443 --> 03:11:29.978

MENTIONED EARLIER --

03:11:31.746 --> 03:11:32.981
AND WE'RE NOT IN A BETTER

03:11:33.048 --> 03:11:34.783
POSITION TO JUDGE A SCIENCE OF

03:11:41.022 --> 03:11:42.324
THE BILL WOULD ACTUALLY HURT

FRANKLY FOR EXAMPLE THE

03:11:53.635 --> 03:11:55.237

FOURTEEN AS THE SUCCESS OF IS

03:11:59.674 --> 03:12:01.576
MISLEADING AT BEST.

03:12:01.643 --> 03:12:03.345
THIS WAS DONE ON STATE AND

03:12:03.411 --> 03:12:04.613
COMMUNAL LANDS HUNTING WAS STILL

03:12:04.679 --> 03:12:06.248
ALLOWED ON PRIVATE LANDS

03:12:06.314 --> 03:12:08.183

DECREASED SINCE THE SUSPENSION

03:12:14.689 --> 03:12:15.824
AND THE RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE

03:12:15.891 --> 03:12:17.392
PETITIONING THE GOVERNMENT TO

03:12:17.459 --> 03:12:18.760
REOPEN HUNTING.

03:12:18.827 --> 03:12:20.095

03:12:23.765 --> 03:12:25.200
AND PERSONAL POSSESSION WHICH IS

03:12:25.267 --> 03:12:27.669
THIS BILL GOES WAY BEYOND THAT.

03:12:27.736 --> 03:12:29.471
FOR NON ASA SPECIES THERE'S NO

03:12:29.537 --> 03:12:31.473

LEGAL UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

SELL IT KNOWLEDGE AGAIN.

03:16:47.629 --> 03:16:49.697
IF UNLESS NOW FEDERAL LAW

03:16:49.764 --> 03:16:50.832

03:16:50.899 --> 03:16:52.567
PREEMPT POSSESSIONS SO WE'RE

03:16:52.634 --> 03:16:55.036
SAYING YOU CAN'T POSSESS IT NOW.

03:16:55.103 --> 03:16:57.005
IF THAT IT IT THAT MEANS THAT

03:16:57.071 --> 03:16:59.607
YOU CAN'T SAY YOU CAN'T SELL IT

03:16:59.674 --> 03:17:00.675
BEN YOU BEND YOUR BILL TO SELL

03:17:00.742 --> 03:17:02.243
IT BUT THERE'S A GRANDFATHER

03:17:02.310 --> 03:17:04.112
DATES IF YOU'VE HAD THE THE ITEM

03:17:04.179 --> 03:17:05.213
ALREADY.

03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:07.282
AND FEDERALLAW SAYS YOU CAN

03:17:07.348 --> 03:17:08.816
SELL IT THEN YOU CAN SELL IT.

03:17:08.883 --> 03:17:09.417
BUT THE CAN YOU PURCHASE THAT

03:17:09.484 --> 03:17:11.519
AND AN ITEM THAT SOMEBODY ELSE

03:17:11.586 --> 03:17:14.522
HAD HIS LAST PREVIOUSLY BEFORE

03:17:14.589 --> 03:17:15.657
THE BAN.

03:17:15.723 --> 03:17:17.258
NO YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BUY A

03:17:19.394 --> 03:17:20.862
THAT'S AN ISSUE I MEAN SOME OF

03:17:20.929 --> 03:17:22.564
THESE ITEMS ARE QUITE OLD THEY

03:17:22.630 --> 03:17:23.498
WOULD FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF

03:17:23.565 --> 03:17:24.999
ANTIQUES.

03:17:25.066 --> 03:17:26.935
AND I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TRY

03:17:27.001 --> 03:17:28.236
TO ADD AN AMENDMENT THAT ALLOWS

03:17:28.303 --> 03:17:29.437
FOR THE SALE.

03:17:29.504 --> 03:17:31.339
OF THOSE ITEMS THAT I UNDERSTAND

03:17:31.406 --> 03:17:33.908
THAT THERE'S SOME DIFFICULTY BUT

03:17:33.975 --> 03:17:34.709
YOU KNOW.

03:17:34.776 --> 03:17:35.610
I DO YOU REALLY WANT TO

03:17:35.677 --> 03:17:37.412

03:17:41.583 --> 03:17:42.750
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SUMMARIZE

03:17:42.817 --> 03:17:47.288
THAT POSITION. TO THIS BILL'S

03:17:47.355 --> 03:17:48.189
ENACTMENT SO SO THEY THAT

03:17:48.256 --> 03:17:48.957
AMENDMENT SAYS YOU CAN

03:17:49.023 --> 03:17:50.258

03:18:04.772 --> 03:18:06.174
TO GET INTO SALES THE REASON THE

03:18:06.241 --> 03:18:08.509
BILL FOCUSES ON POSSESSION IS

03:18:08.576 --> 03:18:10.011
STRICTLY TO STAY WITH IT WITH

THAT ALSO IN THE SHORT TERM

03:25:38.059 --> 03:25:38.859
DETERMINE WHETHER NOT THESE

03:25:38.926 --> 03:25:39.894
BEACHES HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE

03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:41.128

HOMELANDS.

BY KAT US CONGRESS BY STUDIES BY

03:25:57.812 --> 03:25:59.747
WERE WHILE I PHONE AND OTHERS.

03:25:59.814 --> 03:26:01.882
THAT FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN'T FIRE

03:26:01.949 --> 03:26:03.451
PROGRAM IS ABOUT WAY.

FROM TOURISTS FOR HUNTING.

03:26:12.426 --> 03:26:14.962
A MOST OF THESE ARE.

03:26:16.464 --> 03:26:17.431
OUT HERE TODAY FACTO SPEECHES

03:26:17.498 --> 03:26:18.432
ARE SO IMPORTANT THE SYSTEM

03:26:18.499 --> 03:26:19.900
WOULD COLLAPSE.

03:26:19.967 --> 03:26:20.901
WITHOUT THE IMPORTER OF TROPHIES

03:26:20.968 --> 03:26:23.537
THE UNITED STATES.

03:26:23.604 --> 03:26:24.872
BUT ALSO THE SPECIES WOULD

03:26:24.939 --> 03:26:26.307
DISAPPEAR BECAUSE A SERVICE HAVE

03:26:26.373 --> 03:26:27.608

03:27:45.252 --> 03:27:47.388
OF THE FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN

03:27:47.454 --> 03:27:47.922
THIS IS IN YOUR COMMITTEE

03:27:47.988 --> 03:27:49.223
ANALYSIS.

03:27:49.290 --> 03:27:51.358
BUT OF THE DIRECT ECONOMIC

03:27:51.425 --> 03:27:53.661
CONTRIBUTION INTO AFRICA IN

03:27:53.727 --> 03:27:55.196
TERMS OF SUPPORTING JOBS IN

03:27:55.262 --> 03:27:56.263
THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES TO

03:27:56.330 --> 03:27:57.731
SOMEHOW SAY THAT THEY HAVE TO

03:27:57.798 --> 03:27:59.466
CHOOSE HUNTING TO SURVIVE.

03:27:59.533 --> 03:28:00.901
IS NOT ACCURATE --

03:28:00.968 --> 03:28:03.070
TOURISM ALONE IS CONTRIBUTE OVER

03:28:03.137 --> 03:28:05.139
FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY

AND ECO TOURISM ARE DIRECTLY IN

03:28:13.781 --> 03:28:15.249
CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER NOT

03:28:15.316 --> 03:28:17.418
ALWAYS NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS

03:28:17.484 --> 03:28:20.254
BUT THE WAY THAT THESE PROGRAMS

03:28:20.321 --> 03:28:21.388
ARE ADMINISTERED.

03:28:21.455 --> 03:28:22.790
WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE

03:28:22.857 --> 03:28:24.491
CONFIDENCE IN THE CURRENT

03:28:24.558 --> 03:28:26.093

MAKE THOSE CERTIFICATIONS FAIRLY

03:28:29.563 --> 03:28:31.732
BECAUSE YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE.

03:28:31.799 --> 03:28:33.100
AVID HUNTERS OF ENDANGERED

03:28:33.167 --> 03:28:35.436
SPECIES IN THE WHITE HOUSE SO I

03:28:35.502 --> 03:28:36.604
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TRUST IN

03:28:36.670 --> 03:28:38.572
THEM TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE

03:28:38.639 --> 03:28:39.940
WHATEVER --

03:28:40.007 --> 03:28:43.043
GOALS MISTER DINGELL MAY HAVE --

03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:44.945
BUT MORE SO AND NICK CAN

03:28:45.012 --> 03:28:46.881
PROBABLY FILL YOU IN BUT THERE

03:28:46.947 --> 03:28:48.415
IS MORE MONEY COMING IN ON THE

03:28:48.482 --> 03:28:49.917
ECO TOURISM SIDE.

03:28:49.984 --> 03:28:51.552

COUNTRIES STATING THAT YET SO

03:28:56.190 --> 03:28:57.458
THE BECAUSE TERRORISM IS

03:28:57.524 --> 03:28:59.059
TERRORISM REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

03:28:59.126 --> 03:29:00.227

ARCHAEOLOGY IN SOME [inaudible]

03:29:03.564 --> 03:29:05.299
SURE.

03:29:22.483 --> 03:29:23.951
PROBLEM WITH GETTING INFORMATION

03:29:39.566 --> 03:29:40.067
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH THEY

03:29:40.134 --> 03:29:42.269

THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT

03:39:28.622 --> 03:39:29.789
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE?

03:39:29.856 --> 03:39:31.258
AND SO I MAYBE IF YOU COULD JUST

03:39:31.324 --> 03:39:33.326
KIND RESPOND YOU KNOW TO THAT.

03:39:33.393 --> 03:39:38.331
YEAH A PART OF YOUR WE WANT

03:39:38.398 --> 03:39:39.933
THOSE CONSERVATION EFFORTS TO

03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:41.601
CONTINUE IT ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT

03:39:41.668 --> 03:39:42.569
WORKING.

03:39:42.636 --> 03:39:44.838
RIGHT LIKE THEY'RE THERE MAKE IT

03:39:44.905 --> 03:39:46.273
THEY'RE MAKING A GO AT IT BUT

03:39:46.339 --> 03:39:47.474
AND THERE IS SIT THERE ARE SOME

03:39:47.541 --> 03:39:50.076
WINS OUT THERE BUT ON THE WHOLE.

03:39:50.143 --> 03:39:51.545
THE CONTINENT IS IN DECLINE I

03:39:51.611 --> 03:39:53.013
MEAN THESE ARE ENDANGERED

03:39:53.079 --> 03:39:55.949
SPECIES ON THESE WATCHLISTS WITH

03:39:56.016 --> 03:39:58.485
STUDIES AND THE I. U. C. N. FOR

03:39:58.552 --> 03:39:59.519
A REASON RIGHT.

03:39:59.586 --> 03:40:01.187
THERE THEY MAY NOT SURVIVE THIS

03:40:01.254 --> 03:40:03.857
GENERATION SO SOMETHING HAS GOT

03:40:03.924 --> 03:40:05.825
TO CHANGE HOW WE'RE APPROACHING

03:40:05.892 --> 03:40:08.695
THIS PROBLEM ISN'T WORKING AND I

03:40:08.762 --> 03:40:10.363
THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY IT IS NOT

03:40:10.430 --> 03:40:11.865
ABOUT DUCKS ARE CALIFORNIA

03:40:11.932 --> 03:40:13.967
HABITAT.

03:40:14.034 --> 03:40:16.002
IN THIS REALLY UNIQUE I I

03:40:16.069 --> 03:40:17.571
APPRECIATE THE EXAMPLE THE SO A

03:40:17.637 --> 03:40:20.040
VERY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE YOU'RE

03:40:20.106 --> 03:40:20.607
TALKING ABOUT.

03:40:20.674 --> 03:40:23.176
A VERY LIMITED LIST OF ICONIC

03:40:23.243 --> 03:40:25.512
SPECIES THAT --

03:40:25.579 --> 03:40:27.414
ARE CLEARLY ENDANGERED --

03:40:27.480 --> 03:40:29.816
ARE CLEARLY IN DECLINE THE FACTS

03:40:29.883 --> 03:40:31.718
ARE NOT IN DISPUTE ON THAT ARE

03:40:31.785 --> 03:40:33.453
ON THE WHOLE IN THAT CONTINENT.

03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:35.789
THESE SPECIES ARE ARE ARE YOU

03:40:35.855 --> 03:40:38.124
KNOW COLLAPSE --

03:40:38.191 --> 03:40:40.594
AND AGAIN THAT THE SYSTEM WE CAN

03:40:40.660 --> 03:40:42.429
WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE ON WHAT

03:40:42.495 --> 03:40:42.963
THE BEST WAY TO TACKLE THE

03:40:43.029 --> 03:40:44.497
PROBLEM IS.

03:40:44.564 --> 03:40:46.933
OUR PREMISE IS THAT ECO TOURISM

03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:49.736
AND THESE ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF

03:40:49.803 --> 03:40:51.538
OF TOURISM ARE MUCH MORE

03:40:51.605 --> 03:40:53.540
EFFECTIVE ABOUT GETTING DOLLARS

03:40:53.607 --> 03:40:55.041
BACK LOCALLY THEN HUNTING

03:40:55.108 --> 03:40:56.810
INDUSTRY AND I'M AND I'M NOT

03:40:56.876 --> 03:40:58.678
SAYING ALL HUNTING IS POACHING

03:40:58.745 --> 03:41:00.180
BY THE WAY AYE AYE THAT'S THINK

03:41:00.246 --> 03:41:02.182
THAT'S NOT THE YEAH I I SHOULD

03:41:02.248 --> 03:41:03.883
STATE THAT. FOR THE RECORD AND I

03:41:03.950 --> 03:41:05.619
YOU KNOW THAT.

03:41:05.685 --> 03:41:07.721
AND WOMEN ARE HUNTERS TO AYE AYE

03:41:07.787 --> 03:41:09.189
AYE ALSO WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

03:41:09.255 --> 03:41:12.225
BUT I DON'T I DON'T ACTUALLY.

03:41:12.292 --> 03:41:13.460
I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU'RE

03:41:13.526 --> 03:41:15.095
WOMAN OR MAN IF YOU'RE HUNTING

03:41:15.161 --> 03:41:17.998
AND ENDANGERED SPECIES --

03:41:18.064 --> 03:41:19.566
IT'S A PROBLEM --

03:41:19.633 --> 03:41:20.133
FOR FOR AT LEAST FOR ME IS A

03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:21.534
CALIFORNIA'S THAT'S WHY I

03:41:21.601 --> 03:41:23.503
BROUGHT THIS FORWARD BUT I THINK

03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:24.437
IT'S SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK AT

03:41:24.504 --> 03:41:27.974
IN TERMS OF MONITORING OR SOME

03:41:28.041 --> 03:41:29.509
WAY TO SORT OF ACTUALLY.

03:41:29.576 --> 03:41:31.511
IMPROVE OUR DATA SETS I THINK

03:41:31.578 --> 03:41:33.113
WE'VE GOT ABOUT AS GOOD AS WE

03:41:33.179 --> 03:41:34.381
CAN GET OUT OF THE CURRENT STATE

03:41:34.447 --> 03:41:36.783
OF GOVERNMENT DATA COMING FROM

03:41:36.850 --> 03:41:38.284
AFRICA RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S BEEN.

03:41:38.351 --> 03:41:39.219
AS YOU KNOW THESE ARE VERY

03:41:39.285 --> 03:41:40.887
CHALLENGING GOVERNMENTS TO

03:41:40.954 --> 03:41:43.056
INTERACT WITH AND I YOU MAY

03:41:43.123 --> 03:41:44.057
DISAGREE WITH THIS BUT I DON'T

03:41:44.124 --> 03:41:45.392
HAVE A LOT OF TRUST IN OUR

03:41:45.458 --> 03:41:46.493
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW TO

03:41:46.559 --> 03:41:47.927
BEEN BROKER THOSE DEALS AND

03:41:47.994 --> 03:41:49.329
REALLY PUSH THE CONSERVATION

03:41:49.396 --> 03:41:49.863
AGENDA.

03:41:49.929 --> 03:41:50.830
WHICH IS WHY I THINK CALIFORNIA

03:41:50.897 --> 03:41:53.400
OUGHT TO STEP IN SO I I DO

03:41:53.466 --> 03:41:54.501
APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING

03:41:54.567 --> 03:41:58.071
FROM ON IT AND YET THIS IS.

03:41:58.138 --> 03:41:59.406
THIS IS OUR EFFORT TO SORT OF RE

03:41:59.472 --> 03:42:03.276
ORIENT ECOMMERCE GLOBALLY TO SAY

03:42:03.343 --> 03:42:07.047
THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO SAFETY.

03:42:07.113 --> 03:42:08.448
HAVE I JUST IF OPPOSITION MAYBE

03:42:08.515 --> 03:42:09.516

BIRDS WITHOUT WINGS TO FLY.

03:42:18.458 --> 03:42:20.660
WOULD TALK ABOUT DOWN.

03:42:20.727 --> 03:42:22.462
THE ECO TOURISM IT WITH A LIVE

03:42:22.529 --> 03:42:23.063
MANY HUNTING IS REALLY

03:42:23.129 --> 03:42:23.997
ELIMINATING THE WINGS BECAUSE

03:42:24.064 --> 03:42:24.764
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE

03:42:24.831 --> 03:42:26.299
CONSERVATION SYSTEM FLY AS MY

03:42:26.366 --> 03:42:27.534
ANALOGY BUT THE WELL LET ME MAKE

CATAPULT CONSERVATION PARADIGM

03:42:45.552 --> 03:42:46.386
IN SOUTHERN THESE IN AFRICA IS

03:42:46.453 --> 03:42:47.687
BASED UPON SAFARI HONEY TOURISTS

03:42:47.754 --> 03:42:48.755

03:45:53.706 --> 03:45:55.508
I'M I'M REALLY JUST LIFTING A

03:45:55.575 --> 03:45:56.509
STRAIGHT FROM THE ANALYSIS IT SO

03:45:56.576 --> 03:45:58.111
GOOD OUT WHETHER CONSERVATION

03:45:58.177 --> 03:46:00.380
FUNDS WERE PROPERLY USED.

03:46:00.446 --> 03:46:01.948
AND THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT IT

03:46:02.015 --> 03:46:05.051
IS IMPOSSIBLE IN KLEPTOCRACY.

03:46:05.118 --> 03:46:05.952
TRACK WHETHER FOR CONSERVATION

03:46:06.019 --> 03:46:08.187
FUNDS ACTUALLY CONSERVED THESE

03:46:08.254 --> 03:46:10.089
THREATEN ANIMALS.

03:46:10.156 --> 03:46:12.425
AND THAT TRUCK TROPHY HUNTING

03:46:12.492 --> 03:46:15.929
MAY ACTUALLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE.

03:46:15.995 --> 03:46:16.963
