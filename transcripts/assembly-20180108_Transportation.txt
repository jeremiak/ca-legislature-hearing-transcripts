FROM BEING DIVERTED FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL MISTER PATTERSON I HATE TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT I DO HAVE A CORPSMAN LIKE IS TIMES THAT SURE SURE. MAD SURVEY PLEASE CALL ROLE FRAZIER. FONG HERE AND WE ARE CURRY. BAKER. BERMAN. TO. DALY. FRIEDMAN. GET SEVEN. HARPER PRESENT MATHIS THEIR MEDINA. NAZARIAN. O'DONNELL. WE HAVE A CLEARANCE. I'VE TERRIBLY SORRY FOR THOSE IRAQ'S PERSON PLEASE PROCEED THANK AB SIXTY FIVE. IT WILL PREVENT THE USE OF MONEY INTENDED TO IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S ROADWAYS FROM BEING DIVERTED. FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL SIMPLY. PUT A RAILROAD IS NOT A HIGHWAY. YET CURRENT LAW TAKES MONEY FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT. SPECIFICALLY THE STATE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. WHICH. HELPS TO MITIGATE THAT CONGESTION. LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS. AND OF THE STATE HIGHWAY OPERATIONS AND PROTECTION PROGRAM. I FIND THAT LAST ACCOUNT. TITLE. INTERESTING THE STATE HIGHWAY OPERATIONS AND PROTECTION PROGRAM. AND YET IS NOT BEING PARTICULARLY PROTECTED IT SEEMS TO MAKE. THIS IS MONEY PAID HIM BY TAXPAYERS. TO BE USED FOR IMPROVING LOCAL ROADS AND STREETS. MAINTAINING OUR EXISTING HIGHWAYS AND ADDING NEW HIGHWAY CAPACITY TO EASE. CONGESTION. IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL RELIEVE. A DAY TO DAY COMMUTE. OF LITERALLY MILLIONS OF HARD WORKING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. CALIFORNIA HAS RECENTLY INCREASED GAS TAXES AND CAR REGISTRATION FEES. ON WORKING. FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA IT IS. A. TAX THAT IS RELATIVELY. UNPOPULAR IF THE. IF THE POLLS ARE ANY INDICATORS. THE CLAIM WAS MADE. THERE IS NO MONEY. FOR HIGHWAYS. STREETS AND ROADS. WHILE CONTINUING TO RAID THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT. FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. AB SIXTY FIVE IS SIMPLE. IT WILL STOP TRANSFERRING MONEY INTENDED AND COLLECTED FOR ROADS FROM BEING DIVERT TO PAY OFF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BOND DEBT. MEMBERS THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED. TO PAY A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND. WITH THE PROCEEDS FROM SPECIFIC FEES. AND TAXES. SO IT'S SIMPLE IT WILL STOP THIS TRANSFER. OF INTENDED AND COLLECTED MONEY FOR ROADS. BEING DIVERTED. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS ESTIMATED THAT THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THAT BONTA. WILL COST TAXPAYERS OVER THE THIRTY YEAR LIFE OF THE BOND REPAYMENT. NINETEEN POINT FIVE BILLION. DOLLARS IT'S A LOT OF HIGHWAY. IMPROVEMENT. AB SIXTY FIVE WILL MAKE SURE. WE DO NOT PAY THIS MONEY BACK BY RAIDING THESE ACCOUNTS. PAID FOR BY FEES COLLECTED. AND INTENDED SPECIFICALLY. TO FIX OUR HIGHWAYS STREETS AND ROADS. I HAVE HERE TODAY WITH ME DAVID WOLFF REPRESENTING THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. SEAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON AS THE SOMEONE IN SAID DAVID WOLF WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB SIXTY FIVE. MEMBERS WE BEND DIVERTING TRUCK WE FEES TO PAY OFF GENERAL FUND BLIND AT FOR OVER TEN YEARS NOW. WHY THAT CAN BE DEBATED WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A GOOD OR A BAD CHOICE THERE SHOULD BE NO DEBATE REGARDING THE ABILITY TO AND? THE USE OF TRUCK WHICH HE'S TO BE DIVERTED INTO THE GENERAL FUND EVERY YEAR IF THERE'S NO TRANSPORTATION BONDS TO PAY OFF. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT'S A CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THERE'S BEEN DIVERTED INTO THE GENERAL FUND EXISTING TRUCK WE FEES DIVERTED AWAY FROM WORD OF IT MAINTENANCE REPAIR AND CONSTRUCTION. MEMBERS OF BOGGLES THE MIND THAT AFTER FORCING TAXPAYERS TO SHELL OUT ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR AND HIGHER GAS PRICES THROUGH RESCUE ONE. AND THE FACT IS A SAID THE TRUCK WEEK HE'S ALWAYS BEEN DEDICATED TO SOME. SORT OF ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE PROCESS THAT THEY CAN NOW BE DROPPED INTO THE ABYSS THAT IS THE GENERAL FUND OR EVEN SPENT ON HIGH SPEED RAIL. YES MEMBERS THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAIN THAT GOES NOW FROM CHOWCHILLA TO WASCO THAT STILL HAS NO FEDERAL OR PRIVATE INVESTMENT IS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER BUDGET. AND IS NOT A LEGITIMATE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S A PLAN TO TRY CLIMB. IF WE ARE TO USE MORE BONDING CAPACITY WE SHOULD USE THAT ON A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT A MAJORITY OF TAXPAYERS WILL YOU TOSS. WE HAVE A RECORD HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BUDGET SPENDING THAT IS INCREASED BY THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS AND NOT ONE DIME OF NEW FUNDING HAS GONE. TO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS SURELY MEMBERS WE CAN AT LEAST PRIORITIZE. ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR PROJECTS AWAY FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL IT'S WORRIED THOSE PROJECTS USING EXISTING TRUCK WAIT FEES THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES THE BILLION DOLLARS THAT COULD BE USED. MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. IF ANY OTHER WITTICISMS WERE MISSED BUT IS IT. HE NEED MEMBERS THE PUBLIC. WHO LIKE TO? IT'S FINE SUPPORT THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY OF THE PUBLIC THAT LIKE TO TESTIFY. IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL. PLEASE STEP UP STATUE AND WHO YOU REPRESENT PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS LIKELY JEREMY SMITH YABE HAVE WITH THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. CALIFORNIA WE ARE. IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AYE I'D LIKE TO JUST. FOR THE RECORD POINT OUT A FEW. PERTINENT FACTS FIRST OF ALL. ACCORDING TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. THERE'S OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MICRO AND SMALL BUSINESSES DOING WORK ON THIS PROJECT. OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ALREADY TURNING DIRT IN MAKING THE NECESSARY CHANGES. TO ACCOMMODATE HIGH SPEED RAIL WHEN IT. WHEN IT COMES TO FRUITION. OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALONE. THIS PROJECT IS A ALREADY SEEN A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES OF CONSTRUCTION. THIS PROJECT IS WORKING. AND FRANKLY. I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT SPENDING ON HIGH SPEED RAIL. OR LOCAL RAIL OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION THEN. AUTOMOBILE. HELPS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE STATE THAT TAKES CARS AND TRUCKS OFF THE ROADS PEOPLE CAN GET ON A TRAIN. GET AND PUBLIC TRANSIT AND GET TO THEIR JOB. GET TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS WITHOUT DRIVING AND THAT ALSO ALLEVIATES WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY DIRECTLY ON ROADS. THE PRESSURE ON THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED TODAY. SO. WE BELIEVE THE HYPE YOU WERE REAL PROJECT IS. IS BEGINNING TO SHOW FRUIT. OF MANY MANY WORKERS ARE ALREADY EARNING WAGES IN MIDDLE CLASS LIVELIHOODS ON THIS PROJECT. TO PASS THIS BILL WHICH IN EFFECT WOULD. CRIPPLED HIGH FEEL PROJECT. THE WE THINK IS A SHORT SIGHTED AND SHOULD NOT BE PASSED TODAY. I JUST FINALLY OUT THAT WE HAVE HAD FEDERAL MONEY ON THIS PROJECT TARGETED SPENT THE MONEY WE GOT UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. THE PROJECTS WORKING WE ARE YOU KNOW ABOUT A THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TAKE A POSITION WHERE YOU REPRESENTING NEW YORK PLEASE. WHAT MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION I'D LIKE THE LIMELIGHT AYE COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE BUILDING TRADES BEATS WHO ARE? OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THIS MEASURE. IS JUST ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO TAKE WAY FUNDING FROM. HISTORIC PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT THAT IS A GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT IT'S GONNA CREATES AND A GOOD JOB SO FOR THOSE REASONS PROPOSED. Q.. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME WHO REPRESENT NEW POSITIONS INTERNATIONALLY OF OPERATING ENGINEERS IN OPPOSITION. WE BELIEVE THIS CERTAINLY MEETS CRITERIA FOR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WE ALL KNOW THAT TRANSPORTATION. SEVERAL MODES OF TRANSPORTATION THIS IS A MODE OF TRANSPORTATION NEEDS TO BE FUNDED THANK. SWISS. THE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF FOR THE TEAMSTERS AND THE CALIFORNIA COMPETENT MACHINIST AND OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN KEEP DOWN HERE FOR THE CESSATION CAL FOR HIGH SPEED TRAINS I'LL JUST ADD TO THE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUES IN JUST. REMIND REMIND WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AS MISTER SMITH POINTED OUT. ALLEVIATING THE ROADS BY BUILDING THE TRAIN DOESN'T FACT HELP THOSE THAT REMAIN ON THE ROADS IT'S IT'S SYSTEM DOESN'T STOP AT A COUNTY DOESN'T STOP THE CITY LINES THIS IS PART OF THAT. INTEGRATED SYSTEM HIGH SPEED RAIL IS WORKING AS YOU MENTIONED. INTO CORRECT MISTER WOLFE WHO'S USUALLY QUITE ON POINT THAT WE DO HAVE THAT FEDERAL INVESTMENT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SPENT OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS SO THANK YOU. ASKED FOR NO VOTE. SWISS POLICE HERE NAMELY REPRESENT THE SHARE NORMAL THOMAS THE CALIFORNIA ONES FOR JOBS IN OPPOSITION. Q. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF PUBLIC THAT HAVE. A POSITION ON THE BILL. SEEING NONE. QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. SEEING NONE. WE GOT CLOSE WAS PATTERSON CHECK. HOW TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS? IN NO WAY. IN NO WAY WHAT I'M PROPOSING HERE. WHAT CRIPPLE? HIGH SPEED RAIL. WHAT I AM? POINTING OUT HERE IS. THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE. OF USING. SPECIFIC. FEES. MONEY PAID HIM FOR THE PURPOSE. OF ROAD STREET HIGHWAY REPAIR. IN TO THE STATE'S HIGHWAY ACCOUNT WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY THEIR. FOR THE PURPOSES OF HIGHWAY STREET ROAD REPAIR. AND IF YOU'LL NOTICE I SPECIFICALLY PULLED OUT OF. THOSE FUNDS. THE STATE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS THERE. MITIGATION OF CONGESTION AND. MAKING SURE THAT THERE WERE CAPACITY IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ROADS STREETS AND HIGHWAYS THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS FUN. AND THE STATE HIGHWAY OPERATIONS. PROTECTION PROGRAM. IT IS THE GENERAL FUNDS PURPOSE. TO PAY FOR GENERAL FUND BOND OBLIGATIONS. WE HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS. BEFORE. AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST WHETHER YOU ARE. IN FAVOR OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. WHETHER YOU OPPOSE IT OR WHETHER YOU ARE AMBIVALENT ABOUT IT. THIS IS NOT THE AN EFFORT AND NOT OF MY LANGUAGE IN ANY WAY. ATTACKED THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT IS POINTING OUT THE USE OF MONEY THAT THE. TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PAID EM TO THESE ACCOUNTS FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE. OF REPAIRING STREETS ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. AND. IT WE ARE. BEYOND. I THINK OF THE QUESTION. OUT OF THE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. THIS BILL IS CENTRALLY FOCUSED. ON MAKING SURE THAT WE DO NOT BAIT AND SWITCH. THAT WE DO NOT WISH TO HAVE A HIGH SPEED RAIL. SO HARD AND SO MUCH THAT WE WILL BEND AND BREAK EVERY PRINCIPLE. OF DECENT GOOD OPEN TRANSPARENT FINANCING TO DO SO. THE RAILROAD IS NOT A HIGHWAY. AND. A YEAH GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND. IS JUST THAT. THE PROSPECTS OF EIGHT REVENUE BASE BOND FOR EXAMPLE. REPAIRS WOULD BE EUROPE WOULD REVENUE IT AYE WILK UP CLOSE. WOULD NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE. ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE REVENUE STREAMS COULD NOT. SUPPORTED. SO I SAY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO REALLY LIKED HIGH SPEED RAIL AND WANT TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD. PAY FOR IT HONESTLY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND OPENLY. WITH THE GENERAL FUND FOR A GENERAL FUND OBLIGATION. WHICH IS A DAY OUT OF. A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND IT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR. A LONG LONG TIME THERE IS NO REASON FOR US TO CHANGE NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FAMOUS PERSON. THIS PERSON WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. THE ISSUE OF HOW TRANSPORTATION BOND DEBT SERVICES OF HOUSE PAID WAS DEBATED OVER TWO YEARS. AS PART OF SB ONE AND THAT ISSUE WAS SETTLED. FOR THE INK IS EVEN DRY AND S. B. ONE. WE WILL NOT BE READ VISITING THIS ISSUE. AND FOR THAT REASON. AS I STATED WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. BUT INSECTS OR WE HAVE A MOTION FROM MISTER MATHIS AND. A SECOND FROM A CEMENT MAKER.

MR PUTTING GOOD AFTERNOON PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY ABLE OF GO. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AB EIGHTY SEVEN REQUIRES COMPANIES TESTING DRIVE LOS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO PROVIDE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WITH A WRITTEN NOTICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN OUR ACTION PLAN THESE TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED ON A. CURRENTLY PROPOSED DMB REGULATIONS WHICH BEEN WORKED ON FOR THE PAST. TWO AND HALF YEARS ON THESE REGULATIONS ARE ARE WIDELY AGREED UPON WHERE WE HAVE A SOME TENSIONS WHETHER NOT THEY SHOULD BE CODIFIED INTO LAW. THIS CONCERN CAME ABOUT OF OVER A YEAR AGO BUT WE HAD. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES BEING TESTED IN SAN FRANCISCO WITHOUT THE PROPER AUTHORITIES. WITH THOSE CARS BEING TESTED WHAT WE REALIZED IS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DID NOT HAVE ANY JURISDICTION. UPHOLD THESE CARS OFF THE ROAD. THEY CAN ONLY DO SO IF THERE WAS ANY MOVING A FRACTION OR VIOLATION. AND WHAT WE WANT TO ENSURE IS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTINUES TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR CITIES ON OUR STREETS AND THE CONDUCT OF ACCORDINGLY. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS REGULATION DOT THAT BASICALLY. FORCES THE MANUFACTURERS TO LET LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOW WHEN THESE VEHICLES MAY BE TESTED WHERE THE COULD BE TESTED WHAT DATES AND ALSO HOW THE PLAN IN A DIALOGUE WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE WANT TO AVOID. WHAT HAPPENED WITH ONE PARTICULAR SITUATION? FORTUNATELY WAS QUICKLY AVERTED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN. LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCALLY HAS CONTROL OF OUR STREET. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY AYE SPHERE AYE. CONSISTING OF HIM WITNESSES SUPPORT HOW. WHICH NAME HE REPRESENT PLEASE.

YOU MAKE YOUR WAY APPEAR PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN HERE REPRESENT PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS AND MISTER CHAIR OR ABOUT IT WITH TECH NET EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TECHNO IS A MEMBER COMPANY LET PIRACY OWES. AND HAS INNOVATION ECONOMY COMPANIES INVOLVED. OF FIRST AND FOREMOST TECHNET SUPPORTS HOW MISTER TEAMS I A GOAL HERE PUBLIC SAFETY LOCAL NOTIFICATION. AND TOOK TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED AND DIRECTED DMV TO IMPLEMENT AB RULEMAKING. AND TO SELF DRIVING VEHICLE THAT RULE MAKING PROCESS AFTER MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER COMMENTS. SHOULD CONCLUDE THIS MONTH WITH FINAL ADOPTION THE REGULATIONS AS NOTED THE ANALYSIS WE TOO ARE UNCLEAR WAS BILLS NECESSARY THOSE IT REGULATIONS INCLUDE THE EXACT LANGUAGE HERE IN THE BILL YOU'RE LOOKING AT TODAY. MOST IMPORTANT PART TECHNO MEMBERS COURTING IN OFFICE HERE AGAIN CODIFY EXISTING REGULATIONS AND STATUTES CAN REDUCE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO SOCIETAL TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. POTENTIALLY SLOWING INNOVATION CYCLING THE STATE'S ECONOMY FOR THOSE REASONS RESPECT WAS LIKELY ASPER NO VOTE TODAY. IN THIS PLACE TO YOUR ATTORNEY REPRESENT PLEASE MARK LASTING ON BEHALF OF GLOBAL OUGHT TO MAKE HERS I CONCUR WITH THE RIVER REMARKS OF MISS BENNET. WE TOO ARE OPPOSED PUTTING THIS LANGUAGE IN IN CODE. WE FEEL THAT IF IT REGULATORY APPROACH IS THE PROPER APPROACH WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO OPERATING A SAFE MANNER WORKING WITH MUNICIPALITIES WHERE WE EXPAND TESTING. BUT I'M PUTTING THIS IN STATUTE LACS INDIAN AND DOESN'T GIVE DEIAN MUNICIPALITIES OF FLEXIBILITY AS WE THINK THEY NEED GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE SPARE NAMELY REPRESENT. ROBERT CAL AND WITH THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION FOR THE SAME REASONS WE OPPOSE BILL. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE SHARE THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU. S. WINS JOHNSON AND ON BEHALF OF CTA ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THE OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING YOU NINE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE. COMMITTEE. WITH. THREATEN I JUST WANTED TO ASK THE AUTHOR TO RESPOND TO THE ARGUMENTS. THEY DO. BUT TO DOING TO CLOSE UP SHOP. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ELECTED MISTER BERMAN. MR DENG. AS A COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES NOTES THE PROCESS FOR DIEM VIA THOMAS VEHICLE REGULATIONS HAS BEEN. VERY ARDUOUS. AND MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IT'S NOT YET COMPLETE AND YOUR BILL. PROPOSES TO CODIFY ESSENTIALLY A SNAPSHOT IN TIME THAT TODAY. THE REGULATIONS DEALING WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND WHILE I DEFINITELY AGREE THAT THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC IS PARAMOUNT THERE'S STILL A CHANCE THAT THE REGULATIONS MIGHT CHANGE. BUT MOVING FORWARD AND SO. WHAT'S YOUR LONG TERM PLAN FOR THE BILL. AND CODIFICATION OF THE REGULATIONS GIVEN THAT THERE'S STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT THINGS MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER BERMAN. WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY ADAPTING KATINA WANNA WORK WITH DMB AND ADAPT THE LEGISLATION TO MIRROR OR TO HOT MATCH WHAT THEY'RE THINKING WE DO APPRECIATE THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BUT AS I STARTED. THIS PROCESS BEGAN TO HAVE YEARS AGO WE REACHED OUT TO DIEM BE. TODAY TO CONFIRM WHEN THE REGULATIONS MAY ACTUALLY BE DONE AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY VERY CLEAR. WHEN THEY COULD BE DONE SO WE GET A PROCESS THAT COULD BE DONE TOMORROW OR COULD BE DONE IN A COUPLE YEARS. WHAT I DO BELIEVE IS THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK WITH THE BUREAUCRACY BUT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK FASTER THAN THE BUREAUCRACY? SO. CLEARLY PUBLIC CITIZEN THAT WE HAVE TO HEAR FROM EACH OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. AYE IMPORTS WE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF HAVING THIS ISSUE COME INTO MY DISTRICT MUCH SOONER THAN THAT ALL OF YOU. BUT I CAN TELL YOU IT'S IT'S NOT A VERY POSSIBLE CONVERSATION WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED. THAT THEY CAN'T GET VEHICLES OFF THE STREET THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE UNSAFE. ON INTEL THE CREATED ACCIDENT TELL ACTUALLY RUN OVER SOMEBODY TELL THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A MOVING VIOLATION. SO WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO HAVE ANY COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY IN THAT. CIRCUMSTANCE SO WE ARE WE ARE VERY RESPECTFUL OF THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE. ATTACK COMMUNITY IN TRYING TO IRON R. THESE ISSUES OUT BUT AGAIN. THE ONLY ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS SHOULD BE CODIFIED A LOT THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THE POLICY. SO AGAIN WE THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD OUR FIRST STEP. I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE PROVISIONS AROUND LAW ENFORCEMENT NEED TO BE. TO BE CODIFIED SO JUST TO ANSWER WAS FRIEDMAN QUESTIONS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT TECH COMMUNE YOU SEE IF WE CAN FIND. I FIND A BRIDGE BUT AGAIN WE THINK THAT PUBLIC SAFETY SHOULD BE CUT SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT. AND THAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE PUTTING THIS TECHNOLOGY ONTO OUR STREETS TO WORK WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS HOW TO REACT KNOWS WHAT TO DO ARM AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS AROUND DRIVERLESS CARS SO THESE ARE CARS WITHOUT. PEOPLE INSIDE SO THEIR DEATH WE NEED TO BE INTERFACE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SHUT S. CARS DOWN. IF FOR SOME REASON SOMETHING HAPPENS SO AGAIN WE THINK IT'S HIS ARM. A VERY MILD. FIRST STEP. BUT WE DO THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN SAFETY OF OUR CITY STREETS. AND I'LL JUST ACCEPTED AT MY CLOSET THAT'S OKAY. NEARLY MEMBERS WOULD COMMIT QUESTIONS OF THE OFF. SO YOU HAVE YOU HAD TO CLOSE. OUR SIZE TO OPEN HER ROOM MOTION. OKAY MISTER TEAM HOW THIS MORNING YOUR BILL TODAY. AND I'M GENERALLY NOT SUPPORT OF CODIFYING PROPOSED REGULATIONS HOWEVER. THE TESTING OF BABIES WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF A DRIVERS CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUES YOU MENTIONED.

HOW THE WE GOTTA BE MOVING FORWARD? I WOULD HOPE. AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOU WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO COME TO A SOLUTION. HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BIG WAY IN AND ALL OF THEIR CONCERNS ARE ADAPTED. A. WHO HAS BLESSED THEY CAN BE? BUT FOR NOW I'M HAPPY TO VOTE ON AYE ON YOUR BILL TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO.

GABY NINE SEVENTY ONCE SEEKS TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE THIS HAPPENING TO SOMEONE ELSE. HAVING HERSCHER PENALTIES IN PLACE FOR IRRESPONSIBLE TRANSPORT OF LOOSE ITEMS ON OUR HIGHWAYS AND ROADWAYS WILL ACT AS A DETERRENT.
