BUSINESS BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY TODAY MEMBERS THIS IS FILE ITEM FIFTY SIX AB TWENTY ONE OF THREE CORPORATE. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE OH THREE BY SOMETHING NUMBER GLORIA AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY THE FIREARMS. MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. A. MEMBERS IN THIS. NORMALLY HIGHLY POLARIZED DEBATE ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE I RISE THIS AFTERNOON TO BRING FORWARD A BILL WHICH I BELIEVE SHOULD RECEIVE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT ON THIS FLOOR. AB TWENTY ONE OH THREE WOULD ESTABLISH MINIMUM COMMONSENSE STANDARDS FOR INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO LEGALLY CARRY A LOADED CONCEALED WEAPON. AB WHAT TWENTY ONE OH THREE WOULD REQUIRE ALL CONCEALED WEAPON TRAINING COURSES REQUIRED BY EXISTING OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS IN LENGTH. STATE LAW CURRENTLY. ALLOWS FOR A MAXIMUM OF SIXTEEN HOURS FOR THESE TRYING TO TRAINING COURSES BUT HAS NO MINIMUM. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS HE'S TO ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATE PROFICIENCY ON A FIRING RANGE. LASTLY THIS BILL REQUIRE SHERIFFS AND POLICE CHIEFS TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC LIVEFYRE PROFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR CONCEALED WEAPON APPLICANTS. AND THAT THOSE STANDARDS ARE BEING TO BE MADE PUBLIC TO AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. IN CRAFTING THIS LEGISLATION. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH A. PROFESSIONALS ON BEHALF AYE AND RELIED HEAVILY ON BEST PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY CONCEALED WEAPON LICENSING AUTHORITIES. AB TWENTY ONE A THREE EFFECTIVELY CODIFIES INDUSTRY STANDARDS ENSURES ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH THE CONCEALED WEAPONS LICENSE ARE ADEQUATELY TRAINED. I ASK THAT YOU JOIN WITH ME THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AND MOMS DEMAND ACTION IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT COMMONSENSE MEASURE I ASK YOUR AYE THOSE. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA MISTER GIPSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONCE ALL THREE THAT REQUIRES THERE BE A EIGHT HOUR AT LEAST EIGHT HOUR TRAINING. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR A LICENSE TO HAVE A CONCEALED WEAPON THIS BILL IS A COMMON SENSE PIECE OF LEGISLATION ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLOWED TO CARRY A FIREARM IN THE PUBLIC SHOULD. KNOW HOW TO USE THAT BAR ARM IN A VERY SAFE MATTER I WANT TO THANK THE I'M KINDA GENTLEMAN FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING FORTH THIS LEGISLATION AND CERTAINLY WOULD. ASK MY COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE ZERO THREE. THANK YOU MISS GIPSON. MR SHAMUS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I RISE BECAUSE I THINK. RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERSHIP IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A WEAPON YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. HOW IT'S CONDUCTED? BUT I HAVE A OUT A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION. QUESTION THE AUTHOR I KNOW READ YOUR BILL WITH INTEREST AND I NOTICE THAT THERE'S. NO PLACE IN HERE. ALLOW ANY EXCEPTION. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED IN THE MILITARY CHEN QUALIFIED WITH THE WEAPON. AND FOR BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THIS. EVERY YEAR. EVERY YEAR THAT YOU'RE IN THE MILITARY YOU'RE REQUIRED TO SPEND ONE WEEK. IN PREPARATION. WE CALL SNAPPING CLEANING CLASSES EVERYTHING ELSE. AND THEN THE FOLLOWING WEEK. MORE THAN A WEEK FORTY HOURS BECAUSE IT ALWAYS STARTS ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. TO FOR AN EVENING SIXTEEN HUNDRED. WELL WE ACTUALLY SHOOT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS BOTH RIFLE AND PISTOL. I'VE DONE THAT FOR OF MY THREE DECADES IN THE MARINE CORPS QUALIFIED EXPERT AND RIFLE AND PISTOL. WITH THIS BILL RECOGNIZE THE TRAINING THAT I HAVE THAT I DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOME EIGHT HOUR CLASS. BECAUSE I HAVE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF HOURS IN TRAINING. DOES THIS BILL BECKETT EXCEPTION OF FOR THOSE WHO ARE SERVE OUR COUNTRY. HAPPY TRY RESPOND MR. THE SPEAKER I WOULD SAY THAT CURRENTLY ITS CURRENT FORM IT DOES NOT. THIS IS THE FIRST OF THAT ISSUE HAS BEEN RAISED IT WITH GONE THROUGH. TO COMMITTEES OF THIS LEGISLATURE THAT IT SHOULD NOT BEEN BROUGHT UP BEFORE. BUT WE ARE CLEARLY NOT AT THE FINISH LINE SOME HAPPY TO WORK WITH MEMBERS MEMBERS TO ADDRESS ADDITIONAL CONCERNS OF RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. AS YOU RIGHTLY KNOW THOSE WHO SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES DO YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TRAINING THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID FOR MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS TO OR ENOUGH IN OUR COMMUNITY TODAY IN CALIFORNIA. AND MISTER DALLI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS A. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS THE PRIVILEGE TO. HOLD ONE OF THESE PERMITS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT TIME. I'VE HAD IT FOR MANY MANY YEARS. DID SIXTEEN HOURS OF TRAINING. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO EVERY OTHER YEAR YOU HAVE TO DO. A REFRESHER COURSE. AND I DID THE TRAINING I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORTS IT AND MOST THE FOLKS TO. CARRY THESE PERMITS ALREADY. MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF THIS BILL. BUT MY QUESTION IS THAT TIME YOU KNOW I FIND IT REALLY FASCINATING THAT TO ON THIS FLOOR WE REGULATELAW ABIDING CITIZENS THIS BILL IS BASICALLY. AN ADDITION TO THE REGULATION THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. THE BAR SET HIGHER. AND WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF FELONS. IN CALIFORNIA. WHO HAVE FIREARMS THROUGH THE APPS PROGRAM THAT WE DON'T? GO DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND THAT'S THE FRUSTRATING PART OF YESES SOMEBODY WHO. MEETS THE LAW AND THEIR QUIETNESS OF LAWS IS TO SEE FOLKS BE ABLE TO. BREAK THE LAW AND NOT US GO AFTER SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I WOULD. LIKE TO SEE THIS THIS ASSEMBLY IN THIS HOUSE AGO AFTER THE FOLKS WHO ARE BREAKING THE LAWS AND NOT AFTER AND PERMIT LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. ENGLISH DALLY MS MELINDA'S YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU. I AM EXTREMELY PROUD OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE CALIFORNIA CCW PERMIT HOLDERS I WOULD SAY THERE'S NO PROBLEMS. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED W. HOLDERS I THINK IT IS BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY INCIDENTS I'VE HEARD OF HEARING CALIFORNIA SO IT'S NOT CHANGED SOMETHING A FORMULA THAT IS WORKING EXTREMELY WELL. THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. SO. WE HAVE SOME MEMBERS WHO SEEM TO AGREE WITH ME THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING. SOME OF THE. MEMBERS OF ALREADY SPOKEN HAVE BROUGHT ISSUES WITH THIS BILL. THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE TRAINING THAT MILITARY MEMBERS MAY HAVE HAD. THE FACT THAT. COUNTY SHERIFFS ARE REALLY ALREADY IMPLEMENTING THESE TYPES OF REQUIREMENTS. SO IT SEEMS. I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF THIS BILL BRINKLEY. DON'T FIX SOMETHING THAT ISN'T BROKEN. THESE REQUIREMENTS ALREADY IN PLACE AND I. I MYSELF DON'T KNOW OF ANY PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH CCW HOLDERS IN THE STATE I KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD WITH PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE GUNS. LIKE THOSE THAT ARE ON ON THE APPS DATABASE I KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS OF THEM BOYS CCW HOLDERS. I'M NOT AWARE OF THEM SO I WOULD URGE NO VOTE. MISTER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. ONE THINGS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZES THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE BLIND. OF THIS CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT ISSUE IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION TO BAN OPEN CARRY. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT PERSONS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO CARRY A FIREARM IF YOU BANNED OPEN CARRY. AND YOU TRY TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A CONCEALED WEAPON. THEN YOU'RE PUTTING PEOPLE IN AN INABILITY BE ABLE EXERCISE THEIR OWN SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. ONE OF THINGS THAT I DO QUESTION HERE IS WATER THE COSTS WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE BURDEN TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. IN OUR WE INDEED SETTING UP A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY A CERTAIN. AMOUNT OF WEALTH JUST TO SIMPLY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO BEAR A FIREARM. MISTER SPEAKER A. I ASK THIS QUESTION AND I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY. MISTER GLORIA YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR ROBUST DEBATE ON THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AND JUST TO BE RESPONSIVE BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THIS IS THE MID POINT IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OF BUT WE CAN HAVE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL AS THEY ADDRESS OUR MILITARY VETERANS I BELIEVE WE TAKEN AT LEAST TWO VOTES. LIKE THAT ALREADY THE SESSION WE COULD PROBABLY DO THAT AGAIN. I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING ADDITIONAL GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION. THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA OF INVESTED THAT ABILITY IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US AND YOU CAN INTRODUCE A BILL IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT ON. THE LAST THING I WANT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BY SOME WHO WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. AND I REJECT THAT ARGUMENT FORCEFULLY. BECAUSE THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION REALLY ASK WHY CAN'T WE HOW WHY DO WE WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A TRAGEDY OF SOME KIND FOR US TO PUT FORWARD A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS REALLY WHAT THAT ARGUMENT IS. AND I DON'T THINK WHAT ANY OF US WANT TO SEE ANOTHER TRAGEDY WE CAN TAKE ACTION TODAY NOT TO PENALIZE LAW ABIDING. GUN OWNERS BUT TO SIMPLY TO ASK THEM TO PROVE PROFICIENCY THE ABILITY TO% UTILIZE AND STORE THEIR GUN SAFELY. THAT'S NOTHING THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT THERE IS A MINIMUM STANDARD OF FOR FOLKS TO FOLLOW ON AND I DON'T SEE THAT AS BURDENSOME. IMPORTANTLY THE SHERIFF'S DON'T SEE THAT AS BURDENSOME WHAT THIS DOES IS STANDARDIZED ACROSS THIS GREAT STATE OF OURS WELL WITH THE MINIMUM STANDARDS BEFORE HE PERMITTED TO WALK AROUND IN PUBLIC WITH A LOADED GUN. AND SO. I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE LEGISLATION IT'S COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO ALL OF YOUR OFFICES WERE VISITED BY CITIZEN VOLUNTEERS OFTEN MANY OF THEM IN RED SHIRTS MANY OF THEM OTHER SOME OF THEM FATHERS. SOME OF THEM SURVIVORS OF GUN VIOLENCE ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND SO I SAY THIS AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES THAT I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN ESTABLISHING. SOME MODEST BUT MEANINGFUL GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO WALK AROUND IN PUBLIC WITH A LOADED GUN. LET'S SHOW THOSE VOLUNTEERS WHO VISIT YOU JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. THAT IN THIS STATE. THAT IN CALIFORNIA UNLIKE IN WASHINGTON DC THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT WE CAN TAKE ACTION BEFORE OUR TV'S AND OUR NEW SPEEDS AND OUR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS ARE FILLED A STORY OF ANOTHER TRAGEDY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN MAINTAINS INTEGRITY OF ELECTORAL PROCESS. BY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF SIGNATURE GATHER TO RECEIVE PAYMENT BY SIGNATURE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS BOUNTY HUNTERS. THIS PRACTICE THEIR GRADES THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DIRECT DEMOCRACY AND THIS STEP PROCESS BECAUSE THE BEHAVIOR IS BASED ON THE BOUNTY HUNTERS BOTTOM LINE AND NOT THE POLICY. THIS BILL HELPS MAINTAIN THAT TAKE B. OF THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND STILL ALLOWS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE PAID. HOURLY OF OR BY STIPEND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE MISTER HARPER YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AYE THIS BILL IN MY OPINION IS A SALT ON THE GRASSROOTS PROCESS OF COLLECTING BALLOT ISSUES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY THE NONPARTISAN CENTER FOR GOVERNMENTAL STUDIES NO I CALIFORNIA INITIATIVES IS WIDELY EXCLUSIVELY ON VOLUNTEER SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. AND VERY FEW HAVE USED VOLUNTEERS AT ALL IT INDICATES THAT THERE'S A DIFFICULTY IN ORGANIZING TO STATING A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT CAPABLE OF COLLECTING SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND SIGNATURES. I WOULD ARGUE THAT INSTEAD EIGHTY. EXTENSION OF THE PERIOD OF BE ABLE TO GATHER SIGNATURES TO A FULL YEAR WOULD ACTUALLY. ACCOMPLISH WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO SEE. WHICH IS RELYING LESS ON THE PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS MOURN GRASSROOTS ACTIVITY AND MORE ON VOLUNTEERS. I WE ALREADY HAVE A SYSTEM IN OUR BALLOT INITIATIVES A WHERE THEY'RE ONLY BEING I HEARD DURING GENERAL ELECTIONS EVERY TWO YEARS AND INSTEAD EXTENDING THE TIME WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER REVENUE. ON THIS I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD LIMIT THE PUBLIC'S. PARTICIPATION IN THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE. WOULD BE INTERESTED OFTEN IN PROTECTING ITS OWN TURF UP BECAUSE THE BALLOT ISSUE PROCESS WAS DESIGNED FOR THE VOTERS ARE TO BE ABLE TO GO AROUND THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE BUT INSTEAD. WE SHOULD GRANT THAT OUT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORITY OF THE VOTERS ON THIS ISSUE. OF THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE THE COST FOR INITIATIVE PARTICIPANTS ARE TRYING TO USE US SOME SORT OF SALARY. OR WAGE I EFFORT I IS GOING TO BE MORE COSTLY INSTEAD OF. THE PERCH SIGNATURE. EFFORT OUT WHICH PAYS FOLKS FOR THE ACTUAL PREDICT PRODUCTIVITY THAT THE INDEED GIVE AYE TO THE CAMPAIGN TO QUALIFY SPOT SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PREVIOUSLY VETOED SIMILAR LEGISLATION S. B. C. ONE SIXTY EIGHT WHICH WAS CARRIED BY CORPORATE NOT. TWENTY ELEVENI WOULD HAVE DONE A VERY SIMILAR THING IN IT WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. I THINK PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE GOVERNOR'S EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO SQUELCH THE POWER OF THEIR OWN IN FUTURE GOVERNOR'S BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS. IS AGAIN AWAY TO GO AROUND THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND GO DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS SOMETHING THAT I'M SURE THAT EVERY GOVERNOR WOULD ACTUALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO KEEP. AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS POTENTIALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL CALIFORNIA CARTS OF NOTED AYE THAT THERE ARE THAT THESE ARE AMONG THE MOST PRECIOUS RIGHTS OF OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IT IS THE DUTY THE COURTS. JEALOUSLY GUARD OF THESE RIGHTS FROM LEGISLATIVE INTERFERENCE I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT LEGISLATIVE INTERFERENCE AND OBSTRUCTION TO THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS I WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE NO. AND KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF THE BALLOT ISSUE PROCESS GIVEN MORE TIME. BUT I THINK THIS IS OBSTRUCTIONIST AND DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD NOT THROW UP IN FOUGHT AGAINST THE VOTERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM MR LOW YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS SPEAKER I JUST WANTED TO REFERENCE THAT THE STATE OF OREGON HAS PASSED A SIMILAR LAW. IN WHICH THE COURTS HAVE A POLL HAVE HELD A THAT SPECIFIC LAW I'D THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY FOCUSES ON AT GETTING RID OF THE INCENTIVIZING OF SUCH UNETHICAL CONDUCT.

MR HOLDING. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY IS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. TO PRESENT ACR NINETY A WHICH RECOGNIZES THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN. LED BY SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE AND DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN BROUGHT TOGETHER POOR PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION TO IMPROVE THE LIVES. OF ALL AMERICANS AFFECTED BY POVERTY. THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN MAKE EXPANDED THE GOALS OF SCLC BEYOND CIVIL RIGHTS FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS THE CORNERSTONE EVENT OF THE CAMPAIGN WAS TO BE A NEW MARCH ON WASHINGTON. ORIGINALLY SET FOR APRIL TWENTY SIX TWENTY SECOND NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. BUT WAS POSTPONED BY TO MAY TWELFTH NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF DR KING. THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN WAS THE LAST ORGANIZED EFFORT BY DR KING BEFORE HIS DEATH. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS THE STATUS OF POOR PEOPLE HAS NOT CHANGED FOR THE BETTER AT ALL. IMPOVERISHED INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FACE DEVASTATING HOUSING CRISIS. FOOD DESERT'S BROKEN SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND JOB INSTABILITY. AS WE REMEMBER ANOTHER GREAT WORK OF DOCTOR KING AND THE SCLC WE MUST REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE THE AMERICAN DREAM. SEEMS UNATTAINABLE WERE INCOME INEQUALITY CONTINUES TO POLARIZE AND WHERE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WIDENS. WE HEAR THAT EDUCATION IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER. BUT NOT BY ITSELF. ACCORDING TO STUDIES BY THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH AT UC BERKELEY. DR KING EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR POOR WHITES BLACKS LATINOS ASIANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS TO UNITE. HE ASSERTED THAT THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN WOULD ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE POOR COULD COME TOGETHER ACROSS ALL THE OBSTACLES AND BARRIERS SET UP TO DIVIDE US. THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN NEW THAT POVERTY HAS NO RACE. WE AS LEGISLATORS MUST DO OUR PART IN ENSURING THAT NO ONE REMAINS IN THE SHADOWS WORDS LEFT BEHIND. AS HUMAN BEINGS THERE MUST BE A COMMON THREAD OF COMPASSION AMONG ALL OF US. AND A DESIRE TO DO MORE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LESS. THE BLACK CAUCUS IS PROUD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK IT OF GREAT LEADERS LIKE DOCTOR KING AND URGE YOU ALL TO FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS TO UNITE AS A HUMAN RACE. DESPITE PERCEIVED DIFFERENCES.

IN MAY OF NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR DESCRIBED THE SOCIAL CLIMATE CHANGE. AS A SHIFT FROM THE ERA OF CIVIL RIGHTS TO THE ERA OF HUMAN RIGHTS. DOCTOR KING'S WORDS AND POWERFUL IDEAS TO A NOT THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN SERVED AS A BEACON OF HOPE FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING. AND REMAINED AS A MESSAGE OF UNITY. HE CALLED FOR MASS ORGANIZATION AS THE KEY TO EMPOWERMENT CHANGE AND REFORM. TODAY FIFTY YEARS SINCE THE CAMPAIGN BEGAN WE REFLECT UPON THE CONDITION OF LIFE IN AMERICA. AND IN OUR HOME OF CALIFORNIA. THE API COMMUNITY THE POVERTY RATE REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DIG DEEPER INTO THE ASIAN NATIVE. NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS SUBGROUPS. IN CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER OF API'S LIVING IN POVERTY IS NEARLY AT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND. THE NUMBER FOR NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA'S NEARLY A TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND. WE SEE THESE NUMBERS ON THE RISE CAUSED BY MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS A LOT OF HELP ACCESS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF HONEST DIALOGUE WITH ERIC COMMUNITIES ABOUT POVERTY. ON TUESDAY MAY TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. THOUSANDS OF POOR PEOPLE SET UP A TENT CITY ON THE CAPITOL MALL FORCING THOSE IN THE HALLS OF POWER TO SEE THE FACES OF THE POOR WHO HAD COME TO LOBBY THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. THIS WAS RESURRECTION CITY.

PROTESTING RATTLING AND CALLING ON THEIR LEADERS. IN THE CAPITAL TO ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS. THE NEXT DAY BEGAN THE BEGINNING A FORCEFUL POLICE ACTION TO DISBAND THE CAMP. AS WE LOOK BACK ON THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE STILL LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE MILLIONS OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS UNDER RESOURCED. AND THAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUITY STILL EXIST. AS WE REFLECT ON RESURRECTION CITY LET US RESURRECT OUR FIGHT. FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTICE WE MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR ACT EQUITABLE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AND REMEMBER THAT THE UNDERLYING CORE. OF THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN WAS AN ECONOMIC BILL OF RIGHTS WITH VERY SPECIFIC BUDGET AND POLICY DEMANDS A CONGRESS INCLUDING A THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR ANTI POVERTY PACKAGE AS WE GO THROUGH BILLS AND BUDGET THIS YEAR.

PAYING HOMAGE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. MY APOLOGIES THIS IS FILE ITEM EIGHTY EIGHT. SB SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE CORKERY. SENATE BILL SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE BY SENATOR WIENER AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY EVIDENCE DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE UP TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. THIS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT THE INCLUSION OF A PERSON'S IMMIGRATION STATUS IN A PUBLIC COURT RECORD UNLESS THE PARTY SEEKING ITS INCLUSION OBTAINS A RULING BY THE PRESIDING JUDGE. THAT THE EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT. RECENTLY WE'VE SEEN A MASSIVE DROP IN CRIMES BEING REPORTED FROM THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY DUE TO A FEAR THAT THEIR STATUS WILL BE REVEALED IN THEY'LL BE DEPORTED. WE CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION WHICH VICTIMS ARE RELUCTANT TO REPORT CRIMES TESTIFIES WITNESSES OR PURSUE JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA COURTS. THIS BILL IS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND TO ASSEMBLY POLICY COMMITTEES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. NAME IS GONZALEZ FLETCHER SEEING. MISTER ALAN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO YOU. SB SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE. ANOTHER BAD BILL BY. SENATOR WIENER. ALL THIS IS DESIGNED INTERFERE WITH ICE AGES THE GOAL HERE IS CLEAR TO DISSUADE ICE FROM SEEKING TO REST INDIVIDUALS IN COURT SETTINGS. HOWARD THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES NOT DO THAT. S. B. SEVENTY FIVE DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING UNDERLYING REASONS ICE AGENTS MAY MAKE AN IMMIGRATION RELATED ARREST AT A COURTHOUSE. ICE AGENTS DON'T SIT IN COURTROOMS WAITING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE IDENTIFIED AS BEING IN THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. THEY SHOW UP IN THE COURT TO ARREST A SPECIFIC AND YOU INDIVIDUAL TARGETED IN ADVANCED. AS ARTICULATED BY THE U. S. ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS. IN A LETTER TO CALIFORNIA'S SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE TANI KETIL SIX IQ A. MANY INDIVIDUALS TAKEN TO BECAUSE THE COURT HOUSE OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS BUT I NO LONGER TURNED OVER FEDERAL AGENTS BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR COUNTY JAILS. AS CALIFORNIA'S. DEMOCRATS UNFORTUNATELY CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO THWART THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO ARREST INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES IN COUNTY JAILS. ICE AGENTS ARE BEING FORCED TO MAKE ARRESTS IN PUBLIC PLACES AND MUST TAKE SAFETY INTO ACCOUNT. BECAUSE COURTHOUSE VISITORS ARE TYPICALLY SCREEN UPON ENTRY TO SEARCH FOR WEAPONS AND OTHER CONTRABAND THE SAFETY RISK FOR THE ARRESTING OFFICERS AND PERSONS BEING ARRESTED. ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASED. WE MUST. ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES SB SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE IS ABOUT IT ALLOWS YOU BLANKS THAT. WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF ORDER. HOUSE THAT HE SPEAKS TO THE MERIT OF THIS FILM NOT SURE WHAT HE'S DISCUSSING BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THIS BILL. GONZALEZ FLETCHER POINTS WILL TAKE YOU MISTER AROUND PLEASE FOCUS ON THE BILL BEFORE THE BODY. NOT UNFORTUNATELY ASSEMBLING ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WAS SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE BILL SO YOUR POINT IS NOT WELL TAKEN UP BY ME. AND AS I HAVE BEEN BEETLE AS I AS I HAPPEN TO BE AN ELECTED MEMBER. OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IT STANDS UP FOR THE RIGHT OF CALIFORNIA THERE IS THIS YOUR AL NINE HOLES MISTER ALLEN I'VE RULED ON THE POINT OF ORDER. PLEASE PROCEED TO CONFINE YOUR COMMENTS DIRECTLY TO THE BILL IN FRONT OF US. IF YOU MISTER SPEAKER AS I HAVE DONE IN THE PAST I WILL DO IN THE FUTURE. THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY CURRENT LAW ALREADY PROHIBITS AND DISCOURAGES THE INTRODUCTION OF ANY EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION THAT IS NOT RELEVANT CASE AND HAD. INCLUDING A PERSON'S IMMIGRATION STATUS WITHOUT I WOULD URGE A STRONG NO VOTE ON SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE LET'S PROTECT OUR FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES AND LET'S MAKE SURE WE PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW IN CALIFORNIA. MISTER DAVID CHIU YOUR REDNECKS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS MEASURE UNTIL I JUST HEARD THE MOST RECENT COMMENTS FIRST. OTHER WAS A REFERENCE TO THE SO CALLED BAD. BILLS OF ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE I WOULD ASK ALL OF US TO NOT DISPARAGE OUR COLLEAGUES. BUT SECONDLY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER A REFERRED EARLIER TODAY ABOUT BLACK APRIL IN HIS FAVOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. THIS IS A BILL ABOUT PROTECTING ALL OF OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES NOT JUST THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN HIS DISTRICT. MISTER ALAN STATE YOUR POINT OF ORDER AYE I DON'T BELIEVE SLANDERING MY LOVE FOR EVERY SINGLE IMMIGRANT WHO'S COME LEGALLY TO THIS STATE IS CALLED FOR ON THIS FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON. THAT HAS COME TO OUR STATE LEGALLY THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR IS AN AMERICAN VISITOR ALLEN AND WE SHOULD WISH AROUND ALL. MR ALLEN YOU NEED TO ISSUE YOUR POINT OF ORDER IS NOT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO GIVE A POLITICAL SPEECH AT THIS TIME WHAT IS YOUR POINT OF ORDER SIR PETER NO POLITICAL SPEECH WAS INTENDED NOR WAS ONE GIVEN. THE WHATEVER POINT ORDERS JUST. THAT THE SPEAKER STANDING RIGHT NOW SEEM TO INDICATE THAT I WORK FOR FOR ONE ETHNICITY OVER ANOTHER THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE I I DON'T I DON'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL MISTER ALLEN GET THIS YEAR ROUND CALIFORNIA CITIES. THAT AND THERE'S ORDER DOES NOT WELL TAKEN I THINK THAT MIS REPRESENT MISS REPRESENTS ME CHOOSE COMMENTS MISTER CHIU YOU MAY PROCEED ON THE ITEM THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ELECTION WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DROP. IN CRIMES THAT ARE BEING REPORTED BY OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AROUND OUR COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED OUR COURTS TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRANT STATUS. WE CAN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE VICTIMS WHO HAPPEN TO BE OF IMMIGRANT BACKGROUNDS ARE RELUCTANT TO REPORT CRIMES TESTIFIES WITNESSES OR PURSUE JUSTICE IN OUR CALIFORNIA COURTS. EVERY YEAR WE LISTEN TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF OUR SUPREME COURT COME TO TELL US ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPACTING US. IN OUR COURT SYSTEM IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR'S SUPREME COURT JUSTICE A ARTS SPRING COURT CHIEF JUSTICE SENT A LETTER TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION EXPRESSING CONCERNS OF REPORTS. ABOUT ICE AGENTS STOCKING AND DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN OUR CALIFORNIA COURTHOUSES AND IF I MAY. IF I MAY UP PARAPHRASE SHE REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT OUR COURTHOUSES SERVE A VITAL FORM FOR ENSURING ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY. THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THIS BILLS ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE HAVE TRUE JUSTICE FOR ALL IN OUR COURTHOUSES AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR SUPPORT FOR THIS. BILL AND FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER ISSUE. SAYING NO DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ITEM THIS GONZALEZ FLETCHER MIKLOS. JUST TO BE CLEAR WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON HERE IF ANY OF US. WHERE OUR CHILDREN WERE THE VICTIMS OF A CRIME? I THINK ALL OF US WOULD WANT ANY WITNESS TO COME TESTIFY WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HIS OR HER IMMIGRATION STATUS WOULD BE USED IN OPEN COURT AGAINST HIM OR HER. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT ICE AGENTS IT'S NOT ABOUT. CAMPAIGN SPEECHES THIS IS SIMPLY ENSURING THAT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY I RESPECTFULLY.
