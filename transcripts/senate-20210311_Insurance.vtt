INCREASE WHICH IS APPARENTLY

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:53.324
FROZEN AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

WORK AT HOME THIS IS A PERFECT

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.909
EXAMPLE OF A POLICY. FOR THE

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:13.244

BRACKETS FOR MANY YEARS. I

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.463
FIRST DISCOVERED THIS WHEN WE

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.965

THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

00:30:38.736 --> 00:30:40.004
PART OF THEIR STRATEGY IS TO

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:41.272
FILL THEFORCED TO BURN THE

SHELVES FOR THE SPREAD OF FIRE.

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.554

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.323
THE SMOKE CLOSER TO THE GROUND.

00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:59.624
AS MICHAEL MENTIONED AIR

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:04.976
CONSTERNATION FROM THE

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:08.079
AN ADMONISHMENT THAT WAS ISSUED

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:09.981
TO THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:11.916
REVERSE CONDEMNATION AND SHOULD

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:14.051
WE GO DOWN THAT PATH AND- THEN

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:20.091
TRY TO. PREVENT THE PRACTICE OF

INVERSE KIND OF IN A NATION AND

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:24.128
AS FAR AS AS FAR AS THE PROCESS

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:30.401
BY WHICH- NORMALLY- H. R. OUR

THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:42.847
STRUCTURE OF THE WAY OUR OUR-

FOREIGNER STATE. THAT INSURANCE

00:34:47.852 --> 00:34:50.688
RATES WOULD RISE- ENORMOUSLY

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.490
AND THAT WOULD SEE LOSS OF

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:53.157
COVERAGE OF COURSE WE DIDN'T GO

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:57.061
THAT ROUTE. WE CHOSE TO GO A

00:34:57.128 --> 00:34:59.263
DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AND

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.132
NONETHELESS WE HAVE SEEN

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.201
INTEREST RATES RISE AND- LOTS

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:04.936

THEY CAN'T BE SURE PROPERTY.

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:15.413
AND SO WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.981
A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE DONE

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.149
THE RIGHT THING IN TERMS OF THE

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:19.750

00:35:19.817 --> 00:35:21.486

00:35:21.552 --> 00:35:25.857
TRIED TO. ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO.

00:35:25.923 --> 00:35:29.160

ACCOUNTABLE CREATING A FUND

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:37.068
THAT WOULD HELP- OF OFFSET

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:39.971
LOSSES. AND SO THE INSURANCE

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:41.506
COMPANIES LARGELY HAVEN'T BEEN

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:43.941
TOUCHED BUT THE RATES CONTINUE

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:46.777
TO RISE IN SOME AREAS TRIPLE IN

00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:48.379
OTHER AREAS THEY DECIDED NOT TO

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.747
COVER IT ALL AND THAT JUST GOES

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:52.149
AGAINST- WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT

00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:54.385
SEEMS REASONABLE IN THIS

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:56.921
PROCESS SO- YOU KNOW MY

INSURANCE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:12.870

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:19.223
DESCRIBED BURNING BY TRAINED.

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:21.625
AND CERTIFIED BURN BOSSES- WE

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:23.627
ALSO KNOW THAT BURNING. AND

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:25.029
PRESCRIBED BURNING REDUCES THE

00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:27.264
POTENTIAL FOR EXPLOSIVE

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:28.265
WILDFIRES IN TREATED AREAS. HE

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:32.169
HAD. YOU KNOW WHY- PRESCRIBED

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:33.771
BURNING REDUCES THE RISK OF

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:36.073
MORE INTENSE WILDFIRES WOULD

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.875
THAT CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:39.343
THE AVAILABILITY OF PROPERTY

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.712
CASUALLY INSURANCE OR REDUCE

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:43.614
INSURANCE COSTS IN OTHER WORDS.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.651
HERE'S A- IT'S JUST INTO IT WE

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:48.652
KNOW THE PRESCRIBED BURNING

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:51.221
WORKS WE KNOW THAT IT REDUCES

00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:54.725
THE REST FOR- HOMEOWNERS AND

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:55.793
EVEN COMMERCIAL IN IN YOUR

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:58.429
CASE. COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES BUT

00:44:58.495 --> 00:45:00.764
YET WE HAVE THIS- DICHOTOMY

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:03.233
THAT- INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.937

WHAT INFORMATION I HAVE YOU ARE

00:45:12.943 --> 00:45:13.777
RIGHT THERE ARE VERY FEW

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:14.878
COMPANIES THAT WRITE IN THIS

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.713
SPACE I THINK IT'S A VERY

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.715
DIFFICULT SPACE TO WRITE IN A

00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:19.716
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:21.318
MENTIONED IS THE LIABILITY THAT

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:23.353
COMES OF THE FIRE. LEAVES A

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.122
DESIGNATED AREA DEPENDING ON

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:26.557
WHERE THE FIRES THAT RISK CAN

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:28.225
BE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL AND SOME

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:30.794
OF THE SUPPLEMENTS ON FOR FIRES

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:31.528
THAT FOR SOME OF THE TIMBER

00:45:31.595 --> 00:45:32.763
COMPANIES HAVE BEEN IN THE

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:33.664
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:34.965
DOLLARS. BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:36.600
NEED TO ADDRESS WE ALSO NEED TO

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:38.702
BALANCE THE LIABILITY RESTS

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:40.704
AGAINST THE REST OF THE

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:42.039
HOMEOWNERS AND THE INSURERS

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:43.807
WHOSE PROPERTY MAY GET BURNED

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:45.576
ON IT BACK IN A FIRE THAT DOES

00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:47.377
I WAS PRESCRIBED AREA. TERMS OF

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:48.612
THE RIGHT TO RECOVERY BUT IT'S

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:49.947
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE

00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:50.647
WANT TO WORK WITH THE

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:51.715
LEGISLATURE AUTUMN BEFORE

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.250
BECAUSE WE THINK IT IS A

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:54.885
VALUABLE TOOL FOR FORCE

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.820
MANAGEMENT AND REMEMBER THIS.

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.222
IN MANY CASES THE SECRET TO

00:45:58.288 --> 00:45:59.423
LOWER INSURANCE RATES IS TO

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:04.862
LOWER THE RISK AND THIS COULD.

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:05.429
BE A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION.

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:06.797

CRISES. THE FAIR PLAN REMAINS

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:09.466
COMMITTED TO PUTTING OUR

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:10.934
EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE TO

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:12.302
WORK WITH POLICY MAKERS AND

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:13.637
STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP ADDRESS

00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:15.972
THESE CHALLENGES. AS REFLECTED

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:17.407
IN THE COMMITTEERIGHT UP I'D

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:18.542
LIKE TO ECHO THE ROLE OF THE

00:51:18.608 --> 00:51:20.210
FAIR PLAN. THE FAIR PLAN IS THE

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:21.745
INSURER OF LAST RESORT FOR

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:23.480
COVERAGE THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:24.548
THROUGH THE PRIVATE INSURANCE

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:26.383
MARKET. AND IT'S NOT INTENDED

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.951
TO REPLACE STANDARD PROPERTY

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:29.453
COVERAGE LIKE HOMEOWNER'S

00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:31.388
COVERAGE. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:32.956
CREATED THE FAIR PLAN IT

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:35.792
CLEARLY DEFINED THIS NARROW

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:37.160
PURPOSE FOR THE FAIR PLAN. THE

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:38.261
FAIR PLAN PROVIDES BASIC

00:51:38.328 --> 00:51:40.330
PROPERTY INSURANCE PRIMARILY

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:42.599
FOR CONSUMERS WHO ARE UNABLE TO

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:43.133
FIND FIRE INSURANCE IN THE

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.435
PRIVATE MARKET. IN FACT THE

00:51:45.502 --> 00:51:47.237
INSURANCE CODE MAKES IT CLEAR

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:48.672
THAT THE FAIR PLAN IS NOT TO

00:51:48.738 --> 00:51:49.539
COMPETE WITH THE PRIVATE

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.942
MARKET. COVERAGES OF THE FAIR

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:54.044
PLAN DOES NOT PROVIDE. ON THE

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.679
DWELLING ARE READILY AVAILABLE

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:57.047
IN THE PRIVATE MARKET SIMILAR

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:58.448
TO HOW FLOOD AND EARTHQUAKE

00:51:58.515 --> 00:51:59.382
INSURANCE ARE ALSO READILY

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:01.318
AVAILABLE ARE ALSO SUPPLEMENTAL

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:03.854
COVERAGES. BUT WE'VE EXAMPLE

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.021
THINK OF A HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:08.225
OF A FOREST WITH ONE WAY IN AND

00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:08.758
OUT IT HAS NO FIRE STATION

00:52:08.825 --> 00:52:10.961
NEARBY. TO HELP IN THE EVENT OF

00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:13.597
A FIRE. THAT HOUSE IS UNLIKELY

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:14.931
THE PERSON OWNS AND HOUSES

00:52:14.998 --> 00:52:16.466
UNLIKELY TO FIND A FIRE

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:18.101
INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:19.936
PRIVATE MARKET. WHAT THE FAIR

00:52:20.003 --> 00:52:22.772
PLAN IS THERE TO PROVIDE FIRE

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:24.674
INSURANCE FOR THAT RISKS THAT'S

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:25.375
ABSOLUTELY OUR ROLE IN THE

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:26.977
MARKETPLACE. THE PRIVATE

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:27.677
MARKETS READILY AVAILABLE

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:29.646
PROVIDE. OTHER COVERAGES IT'S

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:32.115
JUST A FIRE PERIL THAT'S NOT

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:34.017
AVAILABLE IN SUCH AN INSTANCE.

00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:35.652
WE DO GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:37.087
MY FAIR PLAN POLICIES CAN BE

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:40.524
EXPENSIVE. SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.559
A MINUTE TO JUST ADDRESS THOSE.

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:44.661
THE FAIR PLAN IS A HIGH RISK

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:46.730
POOL THAT PROVIDES COVERAGE TO

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:49.332
THE HIGHEST RISK PROPERTIES. IN

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.067
THE STATE REGARDLESS OF WHERE

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:53.136
THE PROPERTY IS LOCATED. SO NOT

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:54.738
ONLY ARE WE WRITING THE HIGHEST

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.673
RISK PROPERTIES THE FAIR PLAN

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.241
CANNOT CONTROL MORE SHOULD

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:00.443
WEIGH THE CONCENTRATION OF

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:02.245
POLICIES IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA.

00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:04.147
IT'S A FAIR PLANS ROLE TO BE

00:53:04.214 --> 00:53:06.016
AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS WHO

00:53:06.082 --> 00:53:08.151
CANNOT OBTAIN FIRE INSURANCE

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:10.253
THROUGH THE PRIVATE MARKET. NOW

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.621
IN ORDER TO PAY CLAIMS FOR

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:12.756
THESE HIGHEST RESTS THE FAIR

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:15.225
PLAN WAS CHARGED RATE

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:16.660
COMMENSURATE TO ADDRESS.

00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:18.261
GENERALLY SPEAKING I'M OVER

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:19.362
SIMPLIFYING HERE BUT GENERALLY

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:21.131

PAY FOR FUTURE EXPECTED LOSSES

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:27.871
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE FAIR PLAN

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:30.273
HAD. FIFTY EIGHT POLICIES IN

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.375
THE STATE AND THE INSURED ONE

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:33.443
STRUCTURE IN EACH OF THE

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:35.312
STATE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:36.980
THE POTENTIAL FOR WILDFIRE

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.615
DAMAGING OR DESTROYING MORE

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:40.684
THAN ONE PROPERTY IS HIGHLY

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.886
UNLIKELY. RESULTING IN LOWER

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:44.688
PREMIUMS NEEDED TO BE COLLECTED

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:47.724
NOW FOR FUTURE LOSSES. HOWEVER

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.759
THE FAIR PLAN RIGHT ALL FIFTY

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:50.393
EIGHT OF THOSE POLICIES IN THE

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.395
SAME COMMUNITY THE LIKELIHOOD

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:53.830
OF A WILDFIRE DAMAGING OR

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:57.200
DESTROYING ALL FIFTY EIGHT

00:53:57.267 --> 00:54:00.036
POLICIES IN THE SAME COMMUNITY.

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:01.938
THAT PROBABILITY IS

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:05.642
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN FACT

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:06.810
THAT RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR

00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:09.012
HIGHER PREMIUMS TODAY TO BE

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:10.714
ABLE TO PAY THOSE MUCH GREATER

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.049
LOSSES ANTICIPATED LOSSES IN

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:14.784
THE FUTURE SO AGAIN THAT'S

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:16.286
OVERSIMPLIFYING RIGHT MAKING

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:17.520
BUT IN ESSENCE WE HAVE TO

00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:19.055
COLLECT ENOUGH PREMIUM TO TAKE

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:19.889
TODAY TO PAY FOR EXPECTED

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:22.592
LOSSES AND LOSSES IN MANY

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:23.827
INSTANCES ARE DRIVEN BY THE

00:54:23.893 --> 00:54:25.762
CONCENTRATION OF POLICIES IN A

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:28.565
PARTICULAR AREA. SO ESSENTIALLY

00:54:28.632 --> 00:54:29.733
AS THE FAIR PLAN POLICY

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:31.401
CONCENTRATION GROWS OUR

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:33.770
PREMIUMS WILL GO UP. WHICH IS

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:35.605
WHY WE SPEND SO MUCH ENERGY

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:38.241
WORKING ON SOLUTIONS TO HELP

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:40.176
THE FAIR PLAN BECOME SMALLER.

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:42.145
REDUCE CONCENTRATIONS AND

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:43.813
REALLY ONLY BE THERE FOR POLICY

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.715
HOLDERS WHO TRULY CANNOT SECURE

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:47.651
NEEDED FIRE INSURANCE. AS

00:54:47.717 --> 00:54:50.286
STATED EARLIER. WELLINGS

00:54:50.353 --> 00:54:51.755
COVERAGES THAT THE FAIR PLAN

00:54:51.821 --> 00:54:52.989

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:54.224
AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:57.394
WHICH FOSTERS COMPETITION WHICH

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:57.894
IN TURN IS GOOD FOR YOUR

00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:03.400
CONSTITUENTS. WE REMAIN

00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:05.802

FROM THE FAIR PLAN. BACK TO THE

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.641
PRIVATE MARKET AND TO

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:13.543
FACILITATE THIS- WE HAVE

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:14.444

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:14.137
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AT THE FAIR

HOMEOWNER'S POLICY NON RENEWALS.

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:29.219
NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS. 80% OF

00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:32.789
THE POLICYHOLDERS WHO WERE NON

00:56:42.098 --> 00:56:43.900
WELL THAT'S ENCOURAGING THAT

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:45.368
80% DID GO TO THE VOLUNTARY

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:48.738

SOLUTIONS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:04.888
I JOKINGLY SAY PRETTY REGULARLY

MEASURED BY. A SHRINKING

00:57:13.129 --> 00:57:14.531
PORTFOLIO AND A SHRINKING

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:17.467

THE SOLUTION THE FAIR PLAN IS

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:55.805
IN FACT A SAFETY NET. AND A THE

ADJACENT ZIP CODES DOESN'T MEAN

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:16.385
FOR NON RENEWAL TO REDUCE OUR

EXPOSURE IN THESE REGIONS. IT'S

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:20.222
VERY LIKELY THAT THESE INSURERS

01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:21.190
REDUCING EXPOSURE DUE TO THE

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:23.359

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:31.834
EXPOSURE THE REINSURANCE COSTS

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.369
WOULD DOUBLE AND THEY WILL

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.838
LIKELY LEAD WILL LOSE SOME OF

01:09:35.905 --> 01:09:37.406
THEIR REINSURANCE PARTNERS. AS

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:38.774
IT TURNED OUT THE COMPANY DID

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.142
LOSE SOME OF THEIR REINSURANCE

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:45.180
PARTNERS EVEN WITH A REDUCTION.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:46.048
IN THEIR ENSURE PROPERTIES. WE

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:47.583
REALIZE THERE'S NO MAGIC IS

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:49.285
GOING TO GET US ON THIS CRISIS

01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:50.519
THIS IS GOOD FIFTY YEARS IN THE

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:52.154
MAKING. HOWEVER WE WOULD

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.689
ENCOURAGE YOU TO MOVE AS

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:54.623
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO EXTEND

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.326
COVERAGE TO THE FAIR PLAN FOR

01:09:57.393 --> 01:09:58.627
FARM AND RANCH POLICIES. I

01:09:58.694 --> 01:09:59.628
WOULD EVEN GO SO FAR AS

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.397
SUGGESTING REQUESTED GOVERNOR

01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:02.932
HE ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:05.134
MAKING THIS CHANGE AND ALLOW

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:08.037
THE PLAN TO FILE AND USE RATES.

01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:10.172
FIND ACCELERATE THERE WILL. TO

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.740
ENTER THE STREET. THE SAME

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:12.975
COULD BE DONE WITH INCREASING

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.276
THE COMMERCIAL LIMITS OF THE

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:15.911
FAIR PLAN UP TO TEN MILLION

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:19.682
DOLLARS. BOTH OF THOSE CHANGES

01:10:19.748 --> 01:10:20.316
COULD BE FALL WITH IMPLEMENTING

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:21.550
LEGISLATION. WE'RE ALSO

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:23.185
SUGGESTS THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:24.219
CONSIDER CONSIDER ALLOWING

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:26.722

SUCH A POLICY THE HOMEOWNER

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.127
WOULD HAVE A REGULAR OR LOWER

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:34.763
DEDUCTIBLE FOR ONE OFF EVENTS

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:35.598

TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:41.470
FOR WILDFIRES. THIS WOULD BOTH

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:42.938
REDUCE INSURANCE EXPOSURE TO

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:46.775
WILDFIRE LOSSES. WHILE LOWERING

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:47.376
THE COST OF INSURANCE FOR THE

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:49.511

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:51.380

01:31:37.124 --> 01:31:38.492
DOESN'T MAKE THE SITUATION ANY

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:39.827
LESS DIRE. IT'S NOT THE

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:42.029
TOTALITY OF FINANCIAL LOSS IT

01:31:42.096 --> 01:31:43.431
IS CONCERNING LET'S BE CLEAR IT

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:44.398
IS DEFINITELY TO AN EXTENT

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:46.567
CONCERNING. BUT THE REAL ISSUE

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:48.002
IS THAT COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:49.670
HAS BEEN CAPTURED IN THE

01:31:49.737 --> 01:31:51.572
GREATER INSURANCE AVAILABILITY

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:53.341

HAS RESPONDED ACCORDINGLY TO

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:06.420
THAT RISK HOWEVER. THERE IS A

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:08.089
VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:09.957
COMMERCIAL FARM AND RANCH WHEN

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:11.659
THE PRIVATE INSURANCE MARKET

01:32:11.726 --> 01:32:12.526
TAKES STEPS TO REDUCE THE RISK

01:32:12.593 --> 01:32:14.562
PORTFOLIO. NOW IF YOUR

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:15.696
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:17.198
POLICY HOLDER YOU HAVE THE

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:18.366
ABILITY TO SHIFT TO OTHER

CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN. AND THIS

01:32:23.337 --> 01:32:26.140
HEREIN LIES A VERY SPECIFIC

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:26.807
PROBLEM. WHY IF THE FARMER

01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:28.376
RANCHER FONG. A SIMILAR

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:29.677
INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REPLACE

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:31.979
THE POLICY THAT WAS NOT RENEWED.

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:34.148
WELL QUITE OBVIOUSLY THE FAIR

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:35.082
PLAN IS THE INSURER OF LAST

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:37.351
RESORT EXCEPT WHEN IT ISN'T AND

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:38.886
WHEN EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:40.922
FAILS TO EXPLICITLY PROVIDE.

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.423
THE ABILITY OR AVAILABILITY FOR

AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:46.961

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:48.162
THAT'S THE FOLLOWING MY

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:49.730

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:55.469
REASON A BACKSTOP FOR THE

COVERS HOW DO THEY WORK. AND

01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:07.248
THIS IS REALLY THE MOST COMMON

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:08.649
QUESTION I'VE HAD TO ANSWER

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:11.352
OVER THE LAST TWELVE TO

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:12.019
FOURTEEN MONTHS. ENTER

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:15.122
PARAPHRASES. IT TO SIMPLIFY IT.

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:16.290
THE FAMILY OPERATED FARM OR

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:18.693
RANCH TYPICALLY HAS. A VARIETY

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:20.261
OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY.

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.862
THIS CAN BE FOR A QUICK NAP BY

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.831
SAKE BUILDINGS- THE LOSSES

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:24.799
HOWEVER CAN COME FROM THE

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:25.933
PERILS THAT AFFECT ANY OTHER

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.034
KIND OF BUSINESS OR PROPERTY

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.002
AND THESE CAN BE FIRE SLIGHT

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:30.071
STATURE. WHICH REALLY IN MOST

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:31.372
SIMPLY A FARM INSURANCE

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.374
POLICIES ARE R. RANCHO POLICIES

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.076
ARE KIND OF LIKE A HYBRID. THEY

01:33:35.142 --> 01:33:36.610
CAN COMBINE STANDARD COVERAGES

01:33:36.677 --> 01:33:37.378
OFFERED BY A PERSONAL

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.813
HOMEOWNERS POLICY WITH

01:33:38.879 --> 01:33:39.513
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.248
LIABILITY COVERAGE. AND THE

01:33:41.315 --> 01:33:43.184
BENEFIT OF THE FARM POLICY IS

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:44.618
THAT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED TO THE

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:46.520
NEEDS OF FARMERS. FOR EXAMPLE.

01:33:46.587 --> 01:33:47.989
IN TERMS OF FARM LIABILITY

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:49.857
VERSUS COMMERCIAL LIABILITY.

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:52.026
INSURANCE INDUSTRY TREATS THIS

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:53.561
IN A MANNER WHERE THE INSURED

01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:55.029
IS GROWING FRUIT OR RAISING

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:56.764
CATTLE. AND THEY'RE SELLING THE

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:58.499
ROCK COMMODITY IN UNADULTERATED

01:33:58.566 --> 01:34:00.368
FORM. THIS WOULD BE COVERED

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:01.435
UNDER WHAT IS CALLED THE

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:02.103
FORMALIZED ALREADY COVERAGE

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:05.139
FOR. HOWEVER ONCE THE INSURED.

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:06.974
ALTERS THE FORM OF A COMMODITY.

01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:08.075
LIKE CATTLE BEING SOLD

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:09.844
PREPACKAGED BEEF. THIS IS

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:10.644
CONSIDERED A COMMERCIAL

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:12.513
EXPOSURE SO THEREFORE THE FARM

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:13.014
WOULD NEED A COMMERCIAL

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.282
LIABILITY POLICY. IN PLACE TO

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:16.384
PROPERLY COVERED SELL THE

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:18.452
PACKAGE BEEF. SENT OUT FOR FARM

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:19.987
PROPERTY IT'S A LITTLE SIMPLER.

01:34:20.054 --> 01:34:22.056
ANY FARM BUILDING THAT IS USED

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.224
FOR BUSINESS ACTIVITY OTHER

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:24.859
THAN FARMING. IS NOT COVERED

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:25.960
UNDER THE FARM PROPERTY POLICY

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:27.862
FOR. EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A

01:34:27.928 --> 01:34:29.330
MACHINE SHOP ON THE FARM AND

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.364
THE SHOP IS RENTED TO AN

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:32.099
INDIVIDUAL WHO USES TO SHOP TO

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.801
OPERATE A MECHANIC BUSINESS.

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:34.568
THE INSURED WOULD NEED A

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:36.137
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FORM SINCE

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:37.872
THE ACTIVITY IS NOT CONSIDERED

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.106
A FARMING OPERATION BUT A

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:40.674
BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THEN OVER

01:34:40.741 --> 01:34:41.842
LAYING ALL THIS TO FURTHER

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:43.377
COMPLICATE THINGS. WE HAVE

01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:44.445
ANOTHER ELEMENT OF INSURANCE

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:45.713
FOR FARMS AND RANCHES AND

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.515
THAT'S CROP INSURANCE. AND CROP

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:48.983
INSURANCE IS A SPECIALTY LINE

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:50.384
OF INSURANCE SOMETIMES SEPARATE

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:51.852
FROM A FARMER RANCH POLICY BUT

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:52.953
NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.455
NECESSARILY THE CASE. AND THAT

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:56.524
IS PURCHASED BY AN AGRICULTURAL

01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:58.192
PRODUCER. TO PROTECT AGAINST

01:34:58.259 --> 01:34:59.627
EITHER THE LOSS OF CROPS DUE

01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:01.462
TO. NATURAL DISASTERS FOR LOSS

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.564
OF. REVENUE DUE TO CLIENTS ARE

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:06.100
DUE TO DECLINES. IN THE PRICE

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:07.568
OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES. SO

01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:14.442
NOW. TO BRING THIS REALLY FULL

01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:15.276
CIRCLE. CALIFORNIA FARM CAL.

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:16.877
FAR AND RANCH ARE LEFT IN LURCH.

01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:17.845
PRACTICAL PROPERTIES ARE PRONE

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:19.213
TO EXIT THE SAME REST. IS ALL

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:19.680
OTHER RESIDENTIAL AND

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:20.915
COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES. AND ARE

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:21.882
SUBJECT TO THE SAME NON

01:35:21.949 --> 01:35:23.184
RENEWALS IS ALL OTHER POLICY

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:25.453
HOLDERS. THE KEY DIFFERENCE IS

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:27.054
THAT THE FARMER THE RANCHES

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:28.589
UNABLE TO ACQUIRE THE COVERAGE

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:29.390
OF LAST RESORT DUE TO STATE

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:31.158
LAW. SO THE SOLUTION AND NOT

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:32.860
NECESSARILY THE LONG TERM

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:34.728
SOLUTION. IS TO CLARIFY THE

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:36.430
CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN IS

01:35:36.497 --> 01:35:38.165

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:41.502
PROPERTY. BY PROPERTY I MEAN

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.870
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS

01:35:42.937 --> 01:35:44.071

SOLUTION IS WHAT THE CALIFORNIA
