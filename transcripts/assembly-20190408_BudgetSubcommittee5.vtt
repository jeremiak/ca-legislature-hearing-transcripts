DIRECTION IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:45.783

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:07.738
SOME OF OUR BUDGET REQUESTS THAT

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:08.873
ARE A PENDING.

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:09.774
OUR ON THE APPS PROGRAM THE ARE

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.474
PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM PROGRAM --

WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL LOOK AT THIS

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:11.709
VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE FOR THE

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:13.377
FIRST TIME WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:15.146
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:16.881
THE RESOURCES THAT IT IT WILL

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.649

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.050
LIMITED TERM APPOINTMENT BUT I'M

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:21.585
PERMANENT POINT IS.

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:22.353
ACTUALLY LET IT BECOME MORE

00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:24.021
AGGRESSIVE ARE THE GOVERNOR

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.489
AGREED WITH US THAT WE SHOULD

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:27.191
STOP TAKING MONEY OUT OF A

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.692
SPECIAL FUND ACCOUNTS TO TRY.

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.461
TO COVER THE COST OF THIS

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:32.530
BECAUSE IT DEPRIVES THE

00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:33.931
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE OPERA

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:35.099
SUPPOSED TO BE PAID FOR BY THE

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:36.267
SPECIAL FUNDS.

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:37.668
THE TYPE OF SERVICES REQUIRED

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.470
AND SO -- WE SHOULD NOT BE

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:41.071
TAKING MONEY TO HELP FOLKS TO

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:43.340

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:44.942
TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM THAT

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:45.576
PURPOSE SO THEY CAN REGISTER

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:48.145
THEM STAY LICENSE AND SO FORTH --

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:50.080
SO FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING --

00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:51.315
APPREHEND THOSE WHO ARE

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:53.083
ILLEGALLY IN POSSESSION OF

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.553
WEAPONS AND SO THEY SHOULD HELP

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:57.354
US -- IT TAKES A LONG WAY I

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:59.156
SHOULD MENTION AS WELL THAT THE

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.058
THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES --

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.194
IT NOW WILL BE ABLE TO GET FROM

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.895
UNDER THE THE WHOLE IT WAS IN

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:06.864
BECAUSE OF LOSS OF MONEY THAT

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.532
WAS COMING INTO THE DNA ID FUND

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:10.334
AS A RESULT PROP. FORTY SEVEN

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:11.836
YOU MAY RECALL WE ARE NOW

00:41:11.902 --> 00:41:12.903
RECEIVING LESS MONEY INTO THE

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.539
DNA ID FUND WHICH MEANS -- FEWER

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:17.174
DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THE FORENSIC

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:18.876
SERVICES WE WERE EITHER FACING

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:20.678
HAVING TO CUT FORENSIC SERVICES

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:21.445
WOULD MEAN WHICH WOULD MEAN

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:22.279
CUTTING.

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:24.014
FORENSIC SERVICES FOR A LOCAL

00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:25.249
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OR

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:26.417
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:28.252
THAT THE GOVERNOR CAME THROUGH

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.820
AND HAS HELPED US NOW TRY TO GET

00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:30.154
THAT.

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:32.489
ON OF OUR FIRM FOOTING HUMAN

00:41:32.556 --> 00:41:35.826
TRAFFICKING WHICH I'VE EXPRESSED

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:36.760
IN THE PAST.

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:37.561
CALIFORNIA'S GROUND ZERO FOR

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:39.296
THAT THERE'S NO STATE THAT HAS --

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:40.698
HIGHER LEVELS OF HUMAN

00:41:40.764 --> 00:41:42.466
TRAFFICKING FOR SEX FOR LABOR

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:43.934
THE CALIFORNIA WE'RE TRYING TO

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.402
INCREASE OUR ACTIVITY THERE

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:46.570
WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL AND

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:48.272
LOCAL PARTNERS TO GO AFTER THAT

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:49.874
BECAUSE TRULY THE VICTIMS ARE

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.008
JUST THE FOLKS.

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:52.877
WHO LOSE THEIR FAMILY MEMBER TO

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:54.311
SIX TRAFFIC IT'S THE FOR THOSE

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:55.779
WHO ARE BETTER BEANS TRAFFIC IT

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:57.548
WHO ARE THE BIGGEST VICTIMS IT'S

00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:58.215
WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT AS

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:59.016
WELL?

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:00.317
OUR FINALLY I JUST MENTION A

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:01.485
COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT I I

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:03.921
HOPE YOU'LL KEEP INTO A I TAKE

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:04.255
INTO ACCOUNT.

00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:05.589
WHEN WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:07.091
MOVE FORWARD WE'RE ABLE TO MOVE

00:42:07.157 --> 00:42:08.726
AGGRESSIVELY -- I WANT TO THANK

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:10.160
THE CHAIR WOMAN HERE IN THIS

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:11.929
PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE WE WERE

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:13.230
LOOKING AT THE CAL GAME PROGRAM

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:15.165
AND CLEARLY THROUGH THE STATE

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:15.833
AUDITOR WE FOUND OUT THERE WERE

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:16.667
SOME.

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.469
MAJOR FLAWS IN THE SYSTEM.

00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:19.370
AND WE WERE HOPING TO TRY TO

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:21.038
CURE THAT BUT WITHOUT RESOURCES

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.673
WOULD BE DIFFICULT -- THIS

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.475
LEGISLATURE PROVIDED US WITH

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.342
RESOURCES SO NOW WE'RE TACKLING

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:27.244
THAT AND WE'RE HOPING TO SOON BE

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.113
ABLE TO COME OUT WITH A SCRUB OF

00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:30.414
A CAL GAINES PROGRAM SO THAT.

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:31.348
PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA BE

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:33.150
CLASSIFIED ARE CLASSIFIED THE

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:36.186
JET BUT THE NOT IN HARM CAN IN.

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:37.888
VIOLATION OF THEIR RIGHTS SO

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:39.723
THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT HAVE THE

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.692
DOLLARS TO DO THAT WE'RE NOW AT

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:42.860
THE SAME TIME ALONG THE SAME

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:44.495
LINES TRY TO MONITOR MODERNIZE

00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:46.964
OUR FIREARM IT SYSTEMS SO WE CAN

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.132
BE MORE EFFECTIVE WHETHER IT'S

00:42:48.198 --> 00:42:49.566
WITH THE APP'S PROGRAM.

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:50.567
OR MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO

00:42:50.634 --> 00:42:52.569
ARE LAWFULLY REGISTRY WEAPONS

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.138
AND RESPONSIBLY TAKING CARE OF

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:55.739
THOSE WEAPONS THAT THEY WE THEY

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:59.677
ARE TRACK WELL SO WE DON'T --

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:00.711
FIND OURSELVES -- TRACKING THEM

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:02.012
FOR THE WRONG REASONS ARE WE'RE

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:02.947
TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THE

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:05.015
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:08.185
AS HE CCPA. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.320
AS WE TRY TO WRITE THE RAGS.

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:10.487
ARE WE TRYING TO MANAGE A

00:43:10.554 --> 00:43:12.389
REGISTRATION OF KNOWN SEX

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:13.924
OFFENDER TO TO THIS NEW TIERED

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:16.060
SYSTEM WHICH IS A A BEAR OF A

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:16.927
TASK BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER DONE

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:17.561
THIS.

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.196
AND WE CAN'T GET THAT ONE WRONG

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:20.397
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:22.900
WE PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT.

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:23.867
WHO ARE THE LOWER LEVEL

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:25.402
OFFENDERS TO STOP BE CLASSIFIED

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:26.837
AS THE MOST EGREGIOUS SEXUAL

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:28.605
OFFENDERS BUT WE NEED TO GET IT

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:29.773
RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO PUT

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.908
SOMEONE THE WRONG CATEGORY?

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:32.209
BECAUSE THAT REALLY DOES AFFECT

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:33.777
NOT JUST THERE RIGHT BUT THE

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:36.246
RIGHTS OF A CALIFORNIA TO WANT

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:38.749
TO BE SAFE FROM OP PREDATORS WHO

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:39.516
ARE SIX TRAFFICKERS.

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:41.151
I WISH YOU THE SEX OFFENDERS

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:43.187
FINALLY I WANT TO THANKS OF THE

00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:45.222
THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS REGARD

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.156
BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS ISSUE

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:47.825
WITH THE WITH WHAT I CALL THE

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:48.726
FIFTY FIFTY RAFFLE.

00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:50.260
THESE THIS IS THE MAJOR LEAGUE

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:51.729
SPORT SPORTING EVENT RAFFLE

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:54.064
PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS SOMEBODY

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:54.765
SPORTING TEAMS THAT WHOLE

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:56.900
RAFFLES DURING THEIR GAMES.

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.669
AND THERE WAS SOME TALK OF

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:00.170
TRYING TO EXTEND THIS NOW MAKING

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:01.472
A PERMANENT PROGRAM.

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:03.407
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.075
TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE'VE

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:05.642
NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:06.577
AUDIT.

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:10.180
AND IT'S BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD

00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:11.048
THE RESOURCES TO DO THE ODDITY.

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:12.016
WITH YOUR SUPPORT WE ARE NOW

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:13.450
GONNA -- INCREASE THE FEES THAT

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:14.284
WE CHARGE THOSE WANTED TO THE

00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:16.353
RAFFLES SO WE CAN ACTUALLY GO ON

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.488
AND DO THE ODDITY SO THEY'RE

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.023
GONNA PAY A FEE SO THEY CAN DO

00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:21.258
THE ARE -- THEIR RAFFLES AND

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.292
THAT WAS A GREAT WAY TO RESOLVE

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:23.894
THIS SO WE NOW CAN ACTUALLY TELL

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:25.396
YOU REPORT BACK TO IN THE NEXT

00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:26.430
COMING YEARS.

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:27.631
ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS A PROGRAM

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:29.400
THAT'S BENEFITING CALIFORNIANS

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:30.667
ARE NOT.

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:33.370
THE FINAL THING I THINK I'LL SAY

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:34.705
IN THOSE THESE LAST UPDATES IS.

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:35.372
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:36.907
DO NECESSARILY RIGHT AWAY BUT IT

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.175
IS SOMETHING THAT IS BECOMING

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:39.643
MORE AND MORE OF AN ISSUE AND

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.644
THAT IS.

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:43.814
COMPETITIVE SALARIES -- I CAN'T

00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:44.782
TELL YOU HOW TOUGH IT IS TO

00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:47.051
ATTRACT THE MANY WOMEN IT TAKES

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:48.819
TO RETRIEVE WEAPONS FROM FELONS

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:50.521
WHO ARE POSSESSING THEM AGAINST

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:51.488
THE LAW.

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:53.924
WHEN OUR AGENTS GET PAID FAR

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:56.493
LESS THAN AGENTS IN OUR OFFICERS

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.262
AND CIVIL CLASSIFICATIONS ARE

00:44:58.328 --> 00:45:00.531
AGENTS ALL IN THE IN THE APPS

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:02.099
PROGRAM THE FIREARMS PROGRAM?

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:02.699
THEY ALL HAVE TO HAVE COLLEGE

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:03.667
DEGREES.

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:04.468
THERE AGENCIES THAT DON'T

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:05.869
REQUIRE COLLEGE DEGREES YET THEY

00:45:05.936 --> 00:45:07.871
PAY THEIR OFFICERS AND AGENTS

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:08.472
MORE THAT WE GET TO PAY OUR

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.040
FOLKS. TO SOME OF THE MOST

00:45:10.107 --> 00:45:11.608
DANGEROUS WORK I COULD SAY THE

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:12.976
SAME THING ABOUT OUR LEGAL

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.645
SECRETARIES WERE WORKING WITH

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:15.946
ATTORNEYS AGASSI THE SINGLE

00:45:16.013 --> 00:45:18.248
SAVING ABOUT OUR OUR ATTORNEYS.

00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:20.851
WE PAY OUR HIGHEST MOST TRAINED

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:22.219
AND TALENTED ATTORNEYS WITH THE

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:23.320
MOST EXPERIENCE.

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:25.756
AROUND THE SAME AMOUNT THAT A

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:27.458
PRESTIGIOUS LAW FIRM PAYS.

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:29.560
A FIRST YEAR.

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:32.763
LAWYER OUT OF LAW SCHOOL -- IT'S

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:32.963
JUST.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.165
IT'S TOUGH AND I KNOW THAT THIS

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:36.133
IS SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.534
CAN'T DEAL WITH DIRECTLY BECAUSE

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:39.169
IT'S MOSTLY OUR COLLECTIVE

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:41.038
BARGAINING THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:43.640
AND WORK WITH CAL HR -- HUMAN

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:44.241
RESOURCES TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:46.310
BUT IT BECOMES REALLY DIFFICULT

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.578
WHEN YOU ARE GOOD ABOUT GIVING

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:50.047
ME RESOURCES THE HIGHER UP TO

00:45:50.114 --> 00:45:50.981

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.785
REGULATIONS.

00:45:54.852 --> 00:45:56.286
BUT I CAN'T GET TELL THE PEOPLE

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:58.055
TO WORK BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH FOR

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:59.456
THEM TO LEAVE WHAT THEY'VE GOT.

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:00.424
AND TAKE A PAY CUT TO COME AND

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.092
DO IT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:03.861
HAVING JUST PAID ATTENTION TO

00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:05.529
SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE I

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:06.630
THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.298

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:09.967
JUSTICE.

00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:12.102
CAN RIGHTLY SAY THAT THEY ARE

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.604
THE BEST IN THE LAND WHEN IT

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.072
COMES TO PROVIDING JUSTICE.

WITH THE APP'S BACKLOG AND WE

00:46:46.503 --> 00:46:48.038
WERE ASSURED THAT THAT WOULD

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:49.673
TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:53.610

AND YET THE NUMBERS WHAT WE HAVE

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:01.218
SEEN AS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:02.586
WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OF AN

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:04.621
ILLEGAL FIREARM HAS INCREASED IT

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:06.456

THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:28.045
PHENOMENAL JOB.

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.379
A DIFFICULT JOB OFTENTIMES

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:30.814
PARTICULARLY IN TRYING TO

00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:32.316
RETRIEVE WEAPONS FROM PEOPLE WHO

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:33.250
PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.085
UP THAT'S NOT THE CASE ALL THE

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:37.521
TIME MY CONCERN IS HOW THE

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.756
DEPARTMENT IS BEING MANAGED.

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:41.225
IS THE ATTENTION ON WHAT THE MEN

00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:44.494
AND WOMEN IN THE DOJ NEED TO DO

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.829
THAT THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:47.364
LEGISLATURE THE TAXPAYERS HAVE

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.633
GIVEN. TO THIS DEPARTMENT OR IS

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.702
THE ATTENTION ON OTHER THINGS

00:47:51.768 --> 00:47:53.403
PERHAPS AT A FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.972
THAT IS DISTRACTING YOU SO CAN

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:56.873
YOU ANSWER PLEASE WHY WE'VE

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.576
GIVEN ALL THIS MONEY AND YET

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.011
THIS BACKLOG HAS INCREASED.

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:02.246
ASSEMBLYMEMBER DO LOVE TO GIVE

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:04.414

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.250
WE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH -- SOME

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:07.884
FACT SHEETS AND ALSO THE REPORT --

00:48:07.951 --> 00:48:09.419
THAT GOES INTO SOME OF THE APPS

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:12.689
PROGRAM ACTIVITY AND HISTORY --

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:13.290
I BECAUSE I THINK IT'S WORTH

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:14.057
READING.

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:15.792
FIRST I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT WE

00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:17.060
DID A DEEP DIVE ON THE APPS

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:18.929
PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HEARD MANY OF

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:20.430
THE MEMBERS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT

00:48:20.497 --> 00:48:22.199
WHY WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE.

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:23.500
WHO HAVE NOT HAD THEIR WEAPONS

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.269
RETRIEVED EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T

00:48:25.335 --> 00:48:26.737
HAVE A RIGHT TO TO POSSESS IT?

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.572
AND SO I ASKED MY TEAM TO DO A

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:29.673
DEEP DIVE SO WE GET BACK TO YOU

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.174
SO LET ME TELL YOU SOME OF THE

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:31.708
FACT THAT WE FOUND OUT.

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:34.578
FIRST IS A TWENTY NINETEEN NOT

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:35.178
TWENTY THIRTEEN IT'S A IT'S A

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:36.380
DIFFERENT DAY AND IT'S A

00:48:36.446 --> 00:48:37.914
DIFFERENT PROGRAM QUITE HONESTLY

00:48:37.981 --> 00:48:39.583
FROM WHAT IT WAS IN.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:40.584
TWENTY THIRTEEN ARE FOR THEM TO

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:41.184
GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE JUST

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:43.387
EXPLAIN THAT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN

00:48:43.453 --> 00:48:44.688
WE WERE GIVEN A NUMBER OF

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.323
LIMITED TERM POSITIONS.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.424
WITH THE MONEY THAT YOU JUST

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:48.825
MENTIONED TO HIRE FOLKS.

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:50.327
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IT'S TOUGH

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:51.762
ENOUGH TO HIRE SOMEONE TO COME

00:48:51.828 --> 00:48:53.063
TO WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.631
JUSTICE AS A SPECIAL AGENT TO

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:56.033
SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT AND

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.234
DANGEROUS WORK AROUND.

00:48:57.301 --> 00:48:58.502
IT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT WE TELL

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:02.873
THEM AND BY THE WAY I CAN ONLY

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:04.074
HIRE YOU FOR A YEAR.

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:05.042
AND SO A LOT OF THOSE POSITIONS

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:05.642
WENT UNFILLED AND AS A RESULT

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:06.343
SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THE

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:07.544
LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY GAVE TO THE

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:09.212
PARTNER JUSTICE BY THE WAY

00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:11.214
BEFORE I GOT HERE.

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:12.282
NEVER GOT SPENT ANY GOT RETURNED

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:14.751
RIGHT AND SO IT WAS IT YOU YOU

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:16.353
ALLOCATED A CERTAIN AMOUNT.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.221
BUT IT NEVER GOT USED SOME OF IT

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.490
DIDN'T GET USED FOR FOR RELIGION

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:21.992
IT RAISES WE COULDN'T HIGHER.

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.493
UP FOR SOME OF THE POSITIONS

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.028
THAT YOU PROVIDED US BECAUSE

00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:26.263
THEY WERE LIMITED TERM.

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:27.831
CHECK I CAN I'M SORRY CAN I STOP

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:28.432
YOU THERE IF YOU DON'T MIND

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:30.000
MADAM CHAIR BECAUSE WE NEED TO

00:49:30.067 --> 00:49:31.768
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE OF THE MONEY

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:33.003
WAS REQUESTED.

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.439
AND THIS THE BODY WAS ASSURED.

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:36.740
THAT THAT MONEY WOULD BE MORE

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.675
THAN SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THE

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:40.510
ISSUE AT HAND AND IT WASN'T SO

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:42.212
WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE THERE IT

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:43.580
DOESN'T MATTER IT'S THE SAME

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:44.781
DEPARTMENT.

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.216
I AGREE WITH THAT.

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:47.784
BUT IT'S HARD FOR ME.

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:48.385
TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING THAT

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:50.053
HAPPENED WITHOUT A WIN IT WASN'T

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.521
MY WATCH BUT I WILL TELL YOU THE

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:53.824
NIGHT AND I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:55.025
ON THAT I'VE BEEN IN THAT

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.494
POSITION I DO THINK HOWEVER --

00:49:57.561 --> 00:49:59.896
YOUR LAST STOP NOW SO BACKSTOPS

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:04.034
WOULD BE THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:04.668
AND I JUST.

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:05.268
I WHEN HERE SOMEWHERE IN YOUR

00:50:05.335 --> 00:50:07.537
COMMENTS SOME REASSURANCE THAT

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:08.905
THIS TIME.

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:11.875
THE JOB WILL GET DONE BECAUSE IN

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:12.476

OKAY FEEL FREE ARE BECAUSE THIS

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:32.028
WAS IMPORTANT.

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:33.930
WHEN WE DID THE DEEP DIVE THIS

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:34.498
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE

00:50:34.564 --> 00:50:36.867
FOUND [inaudible] ONE THE

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:41.138
WORKLOAD CONTINUES TO INCREASE.

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.706
TO THE HIRING HASN'T GONE AS

REPRESENT I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:48.078
IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN PEOPLE

THOUGHT MAYBE THIS MONEY WOULD

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:49.613
DO IT.

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:51.081
IT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE WE

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:53.049

00:50:53.116 --> 00:50:54.151
THE MONEY THAT YOU GAVE US AND

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.952
SO WE NEVER GOT STAFFED UP THE

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:57.554
WAY IT WOULD HAVE.

00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:59.222
THE NECESSARY TO TRY TO REALLY

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:00.757
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:01.291

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:02.826
SYSTEM.

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.027

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:18.475
WAY AND EXPLAIN IT REAL QUICKLY.

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:19.376
THE REASON WE CAN PICK UP

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:20.777
WEBPAGES BECAUSE EITHER THERE'S

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:22.245

WEAPON EVEN THOUGH BY LAW THEY

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:50.073
LOST THE RIGHT TO POSSESS THOSE

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.007
THE MOMENT.

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:54.744

GOING AFTER THESE FOLKS.

00:52:13.129 --> 00:52:13.930
AT THE BACK AND IS THAT AT THE

00:52:13.997 --> 00:52:15.232
FRONT AND SO ONE OF THESE WE

BECAUSE THEY SERVE THEIR TIME BY

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.072
THE WAY THERE'S TO PROBABLY

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:23.807

GETTING READY GO AFTER THAT

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.622
PERSON.

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:14.758
WE NEED TO HAVE MORE

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:15.592
COORDINATION WITH LOCAL LAW

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:17.861
ENFORCEMENT AND THEN FINALLY.

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:18.795
AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE I

00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:19.863
THINK FOR EVERYONE IN THE

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.197
LEGISLATURE WHO WATCHED WHO

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:23.033
CHEERS FROM YOUR LOCAL FOLKS I

WE'RE NEVER GOING.

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:27.537
TO STAFF UP ENOUGH TO COVER THE

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:29.673
ENTIRE STATE AND THE FORTY

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:30.574
MILLION PEOPLE.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.142
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRY TO

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:33.510
HAVE A BETTER COORDINATION WITH

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.478
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THAT WE

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.379

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:38.315
ADVENTURE THE CASE THAT LA

OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN WEAPONS.

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:45.021
HERE THE DIFFICULTY.

00:53:45.088 --> 00:53:46.790
LA COUNTY CAN LAUGHTER SOMEBODY

00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:48.692
WAS ON APPS INTO THE MOMENT THEY

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.293
STEP OVER THE STREET LINE.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.295
THAT NOW BECOMES.

00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:52.896
ORANGE COUNTY THEN THEY GOT A

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:53.763
LEGO.

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.265
WE DON'T HAVE THAT RESTRICTION

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.466
AND SO.

00:53:56.533 --> 00:53:57.834
IT'S OFTENTIMES DIFFICULT FOR

00:53:57.901 --> 00:53:58.969
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SAY YEAH

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:00.937

THESE ARE JURISDICTION.

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:05.976
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:07.777
CREATE A TEAM THAT WORKS WITH

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:09.212
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:11.247
TRY TO APPREHEND THESE FOLKS AND

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:12.649
WE CAN BE THE GLUE.

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:14.417

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.404
THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE THE COMES

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:45.308
UP. TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE'S BEEN

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:47.143
QUITE A FEW REGULATIONS THAT --

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.612
I'VE BEEN PASSAGE.

00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:50.880
TWENTY SIXTEEN IT'S VERY

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.015
DIFFICULT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE.

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:54.651
OF WHICH WERE VERY VERY

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:54.951
[inaudible]

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:56.986
CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:59.622
CONTROLLING -- ACCESS TO WEAPONS

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.591
BY THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO USE THEM

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:03.860
IN A DEFENSIVE MANNER -- WE GET

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:05.595
WE STILL HAVE THIS APPS.

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:07.597
SITUATION THAT MY COLLEAGUE.

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:09.766
AND YOU JUST INTERACTED ON SO I

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:11.735
DON'T THINK I NEED TO BEAT THAT.

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:15.371
ANY HARDER -- BUT YOU KNOW.

00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:16.005
TWENTY THREE THOUSAND WEAPONS IS

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:17.307
A LOT.

00:56:17.373 --> 00:56:19.843
AND IT HAS GROWN TO THE POINT TO

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:21.745
WHERE IT'S EPIDEMIC.

00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:23.213
AND VERY THREATENING AND I THINK

00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:25.682
THAT -- WE NEED TO JUST DO A

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:26.850
BETTER JOB I UNDERSTAND THE

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.718
EXPLANATIONS YOU JUST GAVE AND

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:30.153
I'M NOT HERE TO CHALLENGE THEM.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.287
I'M JUST HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:33.022
I HOPE.

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.657
THAT WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.

00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:36.659
A BETWEEN YOUR AGENCY AND LOCAL

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:38.094
LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:40.163
UNACCEPTABLE THIS IS POOR

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.831
PERFORMANCE.

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:43.733
JUST PLAINLY STATED THAT'S WHAT

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.302
IT IS AND WE CAN EXPLAIN IT AWAY

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:47.504
IN A WAY THAT'S JUST QUITE

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:49.005
FRANKLY UNACCEPTABLE SO.

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.173
I'M JUST PRAYING THAT WE CAN

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.741
FIGURE THIS OUT AND MAKE IT A

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:54.744
PRIORITY -- IN IN THE DAYS AHEAD

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:56.746
AND THE THE FINAL REMARK THAT I

00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:58.281
HAVE HAS TO DO WITH THE YOU MADE

00:56:58.348 --> 00:57:01.084
A COMMENT ABOUT THE RAPE KITS

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:03.253
WEIRD SEXUAL SOCKETS.

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:05.321
MORE SENSIBLY STATED -- THERE WE

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:06.623
JUST HAD A RECENT AUDIT THAT WAS

00:57:06.689 --> 00:57:07.957
REVIEWED.

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:10.226
AND THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:11.728
SAT WITH ME AS WE HEARD.

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:13.496
SOME OF THE REPORTS AND I HAVE

00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:15.632
TO SAY THAT -- THE COORDINATION

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:17.000
BETWEEN YOUR AGENCY AND LOCAL

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:19.335
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:57:19.402 --> 00:57:21.004
AT THE VERY LEAST IS PROBLEMATIC

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:24.040
AND VERY SCARY -- AND IT'S A

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:25.608
DISSERVICE QUITE HONESTLY

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:28.044
ANOTHER VERY BIG FAILURE.

00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:29.546
THAT -- I HOPE THAT.

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:30.680
YOU WOULD SEE IT AS A BIGGER

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:32.482
PRIORITY AS WE ALL DO I MEAN

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:34.584
CLEARLY IT IS OF A HUGE

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:36.252
DISAPPOINTMENT AND AGAIN THERE'S

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:37.954
EXPLANATIONS.

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:40.089
BUT WE JUST GOT TO DO BETTER MAN

00:57:40.156 --> 00:57:41.691
BUT I I THINK THAT THE

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.393
EXPECTATION IS THAT -- WE

00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:44.861
COORDINATE BETTER.

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:46.396
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:48.064
SEE IT THE SAME WAY.

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.766
THE RUMOR FACT BENCH IF I HAVE A

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:50.934
CHANCE TO RESPOND LET ME A LET

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.571
ME AGREE WITH YOU APART AND AND

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:56.172
GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT EXPLANATION

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:56.806
IMPORT.

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:58.975
A AYE APPLET AGREE WITH UNITED

00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:00.176
STATES STARTED TO THE ASSEMBLY

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:02.045
MEMBERS RESPONSE UP EARLIER I

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.680
THINK YOU'RE HAS BEFORE BETTER

00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:04.447
COORDINATION.

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.382
NO DOUBT NO DOUBT BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:58:06.449 --> 00:58:07.750
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE HERE TO

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:09.552
GIVE ME ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THIS

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:10.253
ON MY OWN.

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.387
THEY'RE JUST NOT COULD BE AND

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:12.622
THERE'S NO REASON TO BECAUSE

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:13.957
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TOUCHES

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:15.158
SOME OF THESE FOLKS.

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:16.993
BEFORE I DO AND SO WE ACTUALLY

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.027
SHOULD CORD.

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:19.796
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:21.931
IT'S I WOULD CALL IT SCARY OR OF

00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:23.900
A FAILURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE I

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.735
DID I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IT'S

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:27.670
IT'S PART OF THE LEARNING CURVE --

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:30.773
THAT BOTH DOJ AND LOCAL LAW FOR

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.242
TO HAS GO TO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:33.943
WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH LOCAL

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:35.511
LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT NOTIFYING US

00:58:35.578 --> 00:58:37.080
WHEN THEY COLLECT A WEAPON THAT

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:40.049
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT THERE AND

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:41.384
HUNT FOR OURSELVES.

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:42.418
WE JUST AT THE COURTNEY ACOSTA

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:42.986
YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT THAT'S

00:58:43.052 --> 00:58:44.287
PROBLEMATIC WHERE LOCAL LAW

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:45.955
ENFORCEMENT COLLECTS WEAPON BUT

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.891
NEVER INFORMS US AND WE'RE AFTER

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:49.092
IT'S SPINNING OUR WHEELS BUT

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:50.894
USING TAXPAYER MONEY. TO GET OUR

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.795
AGE IS READY TO COLLECT A WEAPON

00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:53.830
THAT ALREADY GOT TURNED IT.

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:55.798
SAME TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.934
WE RECOGNIZE THAT HOW WE

00:58:58.001 --> 00:58:58.468
COORDINATE WITH LOCAL LAW

00:58:58.534 --> 00:58:59.135
ENFORCEMENT.

00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:00.870
WILL REQUIRE.

00:59:00.937 --> 00:59:01.905
QUITE A BIT.

00:59:01.971 --> 00:59:03.840
OF WORK COLLABORATION BECAUSE

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:05.541
THEY ARE LIMITED.

00:59:05.608 --> 00:59:06.843
IN CERTAIN TERMS AS I SAID

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:08.611
JURISDICTION ONLY.

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:09.846
WE ARE OF LIMITED BY CAPACITY

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:11.848
AND WE HAVE TO TALK.

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:13.683
AND SO THERE IS ABSOLUTELY MORE

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.485
WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:16.119
BUT I WANT TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING

00:59:16.185 --> 00:59:17.320
THIS.

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:18.955
AND I WOULD AYE AYE INVITE EACH

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:21.090
AND EVERYONE OF YOU. TO GO DO A

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:22.258
RIDE ALONG WITH THESE AGENTS. TO

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:24.994
SEE WHAT THEY DO.

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:27.196
IT IS SOMETIMES VERY DANGEROUS.

00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:27.697
IT IS OFTEN TIMES VERY

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:28.798
FRUSTRATING.

00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:31.034
BECAUSE THE THE THE THE THE THE

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.101
LEVELS.

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:35.171
THEY GO TO TO TRY TO FIND FOLKS.

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.940
WOULD FRUSTRATE.

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:38.808
AT BUT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:40.243
BECAUSE THESE FOLKS ON THE LIST.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.312
AND THE MORE WE CAN MAKE IT SO

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:43.446
THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:45.481
SUCCESS.

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:46.582
THE BETTER OFF EVERYONE HE'S.

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:47.850
AND SO.

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:48.885
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AS A

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.586
MEMBER WE DO NEED TO DO MUCH

00:59:50.653 --> 00:59:51.788
MORE WHEN IT COMES TO

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:52.121
COORDINATION.

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:53.423
BUT I WILL TELL YOU.

00:59:53.489 --> 00:59:55.291
I AM ABSOLUTELY PROUD OF THE

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:55.825
WORK.

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:58.127
THAT THE FIREARMS EIGHT

00:59:58.194 --> 00:59:59.595
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT WE HAVE

00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:01.297
HAVE DONE BECAUSE AS I SAID

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:02.465
PERHAPS THE BEST TESTAMENT IS

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:04.000
THE FACT THAT NO.

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.535

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:07.670
PROCESS OF COLLECTING.

BUT SENSE I MEAN I KNOW YOU TALK

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:43.606

I WANT TO JUST ASK A QUESTION OR

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:48.411
TWO ABOUT THAT IF THAT'S OKAY --

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.113
I I GUESS WHEN WE WERE LOOKING

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:53.616
AT SOME OF THE INITIAL DATA TO

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.885
LOOK LIKE THE PROJECTED BACKLOG

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:57.587
WAS GONNA COME DOWN EVENTUALLY

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.956
DOWN -- TO ABOUT LITTLE BIT

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.657

GUESS THERE WAS MORE INFORMATION

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.628
SUBMITTED THAT SET THE BACKLOG

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:11.401
WOULD GO UP TO THIRTEEN THOUSAND

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.102
WHAT WAS THE AND AND I'M SORRY

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:14.704
FROM LOOKING AT TWO DIFFERENT.

SUBMITTED.

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:19.876
WE WE DECIDED.

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:21.544
TO I ADMIT AS IMAGE BEFORE WE WE

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.579
HAD A BORE DOWN. TO UNDERSTAND

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:24.647
THE APPS PROGRAM AND THE

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:28.384
TERMINOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE BACKLOT.

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:30.853
I I'M NOT SURE IF WE ALL WOULD.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.821
THE FIND THE BACKLOG THE SAME

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.856
WAY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN WE

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.425
SPOKE ABOUT BACKLOG I THINK

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:36.926
YOU'RE ABOUT THIRTEEN ALTHOUGH

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.628
THERE WERE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:39.529
CASES LIKE MIKE I KEEP A CRACK

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:40.129
ME FORMA.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.964
ABOUT TWENTY KEPT THOUSAND CASES

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.399
STILL OUTSTANDING.

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:44.467
ALL THOSE CASES FOR THE

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:45.902
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES WHICH

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:49.038
PROBABLY WOULD NOT IDENTIFY TO

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:50.073
FOLKS BACK IN.

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.107
TWENTY THIRTEEN IN THAT SAME

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.675
INTERVENING AMOUNT OF TIME TENS

HAVE TO BE RETRIEVED.

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.017
AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:03.152
WORKING THE LIST TO REMOVE A LOT

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.921
OF FOLKS FROM THE WHAT WAS

THOSE THAT ARE COMING INTO THE

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:08.357
SYSTEM.

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.993
HERE'S THE THING.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.829
SOMEONE HAS TO WAIT.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:15.298
IF SOMEONE GETS IN LINE AND AND

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:15.932

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:18.234
THEY BECOME PART OF THE BACK

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:18.835
WHAT THEY MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.403
THERE FOR A MONTH.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.804
BUT WE HAVE WORKED THE SOME

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:22.638
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN THERE FOR

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:24.273
YEARS AND SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.676
CLEAR UP WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:29.545
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:30.446
THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN.

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:31.747
THE SO CALLED BACK WHAT WAS

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:33.149
IDENTIFIED.

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:34.617
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:35.318
THAT WAS ON THAT.

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:36.652
BACKLOG.

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:38.387
HAS EITHER BEEN [inaudible]

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:40.490
CLEARED.

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.859
IS WHAT WE NOW CALL PENDING IF

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:43.826
YOU LOOK AT A REPORT YOU'LL DO

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.561
YOUR WILL BE CLIP PENDING MEANS

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:46.262
WE TRY TO WORK THEM SEVERAL

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:46.963
TIMES.

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.898
BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SAY

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:49.899
FOR SURE.

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.167
THEY NO LONGER HAVE A WEAPON SO

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.969
WE CAN'T SAY THEY'RE CLEAR BUT

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.504
WE CAN'T SAY THEIR ACT BECAUSE

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.938
WE TRIED FIVE SIX TIMES.

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:58.341
AND THEN THERE'S THE ACTIVE

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.542
THOSE THAT WE'RE PURSUING.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.110
ONGOING AND IF YOU ADD THOSE UP

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:03.479
THE ARE CLEARED.

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:06.149
THE PENDING AND THE ACTIVE THAT

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:08.117

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:09.585
TOTAL NUMBERS.

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.487
THAT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHAT A

01:03:11.554 --> 01:03:12.688
BIG CLASSIFIED PRINCIPALLY IS

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:14.924
JUST BACK LOCK WHICH DOESN'T

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:15.625
REALLY GIVE YOU CLEAR SAID

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.326
BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED WE COULD

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.529
BE GOING AFTER SOMEONE.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:20.663
WHO NO LONGER HAS A WEAPON?

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.031
BUT WE DON'T KNOW IT.

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:23.766
AND SO WE CAN'T CLEAR THE MATURE

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.535
WE KNOW FOR SURE.

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:27.270
AND SO THEY STAY ON OUR LISTING

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:28.371
WE CAN CLEAR THEM UNTIL IT'S

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.740
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND SO THAT'S

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:32.308
THE DIFFERENCE AND I HOPE YOU'LL

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.242
READ THE REPORT.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.077

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:39.115
LACKEY TRY TO POINT TO WE

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:40.216
IDENTIFIED THE WARTS IN THE

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.317
SYSTEM THE WAY HAVE BEEN

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:42.485
DESCRIBED BEFORE.

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:43.486
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET TO A

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.188
PLACE WHERE EVERYONE CAN AGREE

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.522
WITH THAT STANDARDIZED THE TERMS

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:47.757

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:52.295
SHOW BECAUSE THOUGH I THINK I

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:53.429
THINK ANY ONE OF US WANTS.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.364
IS JEOPARDIZED THE SUCCESSFUL

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.733
WORK OF THIS PROGRAM WE WERE FOR

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.302
THE LONGEST TIME TAKING MONEY

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:00.269
OUT OF THE DRAWS ACCOUNT WHICH

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:02.505
IS THE DEALER -- RECORD OF SALE

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.006
ACCOUNT SO EVERY TIME SOMEONE

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.775
WANTS TO REGISTER.

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:07.076
AS A DEALER OR EVERY TIME WELL A

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:11.113
LAWFUL OWNER WANTS TO REGISTER.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:11.881
WE USE THAT SYSTEM. TO TRACK

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:13.115
THEM.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:15.151
BUT WE WERE TAKING GROWS BUNNY

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.119
WHICH IS TO HELP LAWFUL.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:18.421
POSSESSORS OF WEAPONS OR SELLERS

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.323
OF WEAPONS TO GO AFTER THOSE WHO

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.491
HAD ILLEGALLY MAINTAIN

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:23.259
POSSESSION.

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:24.093
AND SO SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:24.961
AND THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNOR

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.195
SAID WHY SHOULD BE TAKING MONEY

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:27.763
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE USED TO

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.398
HELP WAFFLE FOLKS STATE.

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:31.834

WHICH YOU GET MONEY SEPARATELY

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.407
SO WE DON'T UNDERMINE THE

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:39.642
ABILITY OF THE GOOD GUYS TO DO

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:40.509
IT THE RIGHT WAY.

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:41.477
AND THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR DID

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:43.279
IN THIS IN THIS CASE HE'S GIVEN

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:44.947

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.586
OUT OF THE DRAWS FUND AND AWAY

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:51.854

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:52.521
REGISTRATION ACTIVITIES WE HAVE

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:53.990

COULD HAVE BEEN YOU JUST CLICK

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.871
THAT YOU'RE DEBTS I THOUGHT

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:02.605
SOUNDS LIKE THAT SOME OF WHAT

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:03.706
YOU DID LAST YEAR WHICH YOU

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:04.907
CLEAN UP YOUR DATABASE RIGHT.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.275
SOME PEOPLE HAVE PASSED AWAY

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:11.280
THEY'RE OFF THE DATA THAT'S

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:11.881
RIGHT FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:13.182
WERE.

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:14.183
BUT YOU DO WAY THROUGH AND TOOK

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.351

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:17.853
PEOPLE OFF.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.888
CORRECT SO INTO THAT BY THE END

01:09:18.954 --> 01:09:20.523
OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:23.025
HAD CLEARED TEN THOUSAND SIX

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:25.127
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE SUBJECTS

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:26.395
FROM.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.664
THE APPS DATABASE IN AND THAT IS

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:30.165
JUST IN THE CALENDAR YEAR YOU'RE

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:32.434
TALKING THAT IS JUST IN THAT

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:35.037
CALENDAR YEAR OKAY PERFECT.

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.739
GERMAN ASK HOW MANY WE GOT.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.707
SO DIDN'T WILL ACT ACTIVE WAS

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:42.378
NINE THOUSAND FOUR OF FOUR WELL

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.846
IT AB I THINK WITH THE WHOLE.

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:44.847
YOUR SIM THAT SAME YEAR OKAY WE

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:46.649
HAD RECEIVED ELEVEN THOUSAND

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:47.249
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE NEW

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:48.384
OUT LEVY THOUSAND HOW MANY SIR

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:52.121
LEVIN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:52.721
TWENTY NINE IN THE CHAMBER THE

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.056
POINT OF THAT SHOW YOU THAT WE

01:09:54.123 --> 01:09:55.624
COULD OVER.

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:56.859
TEN THOUSAND BUT WE GOT NEW NOT

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:59.328
EXISTED BEFORE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:09:59.395 --> 01:09:59.929
ELEVEN THOUSAND SURE SO SOME

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:00.563
WOULD SAY WELL YOU'RE FALLING

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:02.064
BEHIND AND IN A WAY YOU THAT'S

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.732
RIGHT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:05.301
ENTERING THE SYSTEM.

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.036
AND WE STILL HAD A CLEAR THE

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:07.836
FOLKS THAT EXISTED FROM WAY BACK

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:08.537
WHEN.

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:09.939
THE AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:12.675
NEVER CAME THROUGH AND I THINK

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:13.275
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR MEMBERS TO

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:14.176
UNDERSTAND.

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:15.077
WELL WITHIN THAT THAT THAT'S WHY

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:17.913
I THINK IT'D BE A BE HELPFUL. TO

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.982
ON AGAIN YOU YOU HAVE  BACKWARD

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.584
LOOKING DATA BUT SAID YOU SORT

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:23.485
OF STARTED LOOKING AT DATE A

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:24.653
LITTLE BIT TO FLARE OUR STATE

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.454
MADE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:26.789
HELPFUL TO BREAK OUT MORE.

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.324
RIGHT SAYS THAT THIS IS MUCH A

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.059
LOT CLEARER SO THEN PENDING

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.727
WHAT'S IN YOUR PENDING CATEGORY

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:33.162
BECAUSE OF VESSELS INTENDING AS

01:10:33.228 --> 01:10:37.333
OF THE END OF THE YEAR WAS ABOUT.

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:37.967
THIRTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.568
CASES WERE IN THOSE CASES.

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:41.203
YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST PUTTING IN

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.974
LIKE A PARKING LOT BUT YOU'RE

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:45.808
NOT YOU'RE NOT WORKING.

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:46.408
CORRECT WE'VE ALREADY WORKED

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:49.878
THOSE CASES YES -- SO THERE THE

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:52.014
EITHER -- FALL INTO A CATEGORY

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:53.449
OF UNABLE TO CLEAR.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:54.516
TYPICALLY THOSE ARE FOLKS WERE

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.051
WE'VE MAY BE SEIZED ALREADY A

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:57.786
COUPLE OTHER FIREARMS BUT WE

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:58.954
WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE OTHER

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:00.756
ONES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:01.824
TELL WEAKENED.

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.192
RECOVER THOSE WEAPONS WE CAN'T

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.727
CLEAR THEM FROM THE SYSTEM.

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:05.694
THE OTHER CATEGORIES OUT OF

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:07.229
STATE SO SINCE THEY BECAME

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:08.631
PROHIBITED THEY'VE NOW MOVED OUT

01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:10.399
OF STATE -- WE STILL HAVE TO

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:11.500
KEEP TRACK OF THEM IN CASE THEY

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:13.002
COME BACK INTO THE STATE BUT

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:14.136
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING ELSE FOR

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:15.938
US TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA ON

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:16.572
THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.674
AND MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT LIST

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:20.242
DEPENDING COULD BE. FOUR MONTHS

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:21.644
OLD.

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.746
OR FOUR YEARS OLD CORRECT

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.547
BECAUSE DOT THE WE CAN'T CLEAR

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:26.882
THEM WE CAN'T WE CAN'T DISPOSE

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:27.850
OF THEM.

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:29.418
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT SOME

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:30.786
OF THE CONFUSION COMES IN.

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:32.087
BECAUSE FOLKS AREN'T TRACK IT

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:33.555
FOLKS LOOKING AT THIS AS A

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:35.124
STATIC NUMBER IT'S NOT STATIC

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:36.358
BECAUSE EVERY DAY SOMEONE WHO

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:37.826
COMES INTO THE SYSTEM AND EVERY

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:39.061
DAY WE CLEAR SOMEONE.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.262
AT EVERY DAY WE MOVE SOMEONE

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:42.831

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:45.100
IN AN OF OF THE IN ON IF YOU

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.103
OF OF THE ONES THAT WERE CLEAR

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:49.972
THE TEN THOUSAND SIX EIGHTY ONE

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:51.507
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE CLEAR

INTO THREE CATEGORIES FOR TWO

01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.048
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN TWO

01:11:59.114 --> 01:11:59.848

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.594

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:21.130
COMMENTS IN YOUR THOUGHTS AROUND

THAT -- IT IS IT'S A TIME I

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:26.001
THINK WHERE THERE IS SOME

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.003
INTEREST ESPECIALLY SOME SOME

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.705
LOCAL LEADERSHIP LOCAL LAW FOR

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.073
SEPTEMBER DOES WANT.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.541
TO WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU SO

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.610
WE WOULD LOVE TO FIGURE OUT --

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:35.444
WAYS TO EXPLORE SPECIALLY YOU

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:36.812
KNOW WHICH YOU KNOW YOU TO LOVE

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:38.080
TO GET ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:39.148
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT CITIES TO

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:40.415
BE ON FOR THAT'S NOT ALWAYS

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:41.583
GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.185
SO IT'S JUST TRYING TO FIND

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.087
WHICH AGENCIES WHICH DEPARTMENTS

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.789
REALLY WANT TO TAKE THE LEAD IN

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:47.389
THIS SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.091
INTEREST IN DIFFERENT APARTMENTS

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.726
AROUND THE STATE'S REALLY HOPE

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:50.993

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.060
YOU AND YOUR TEAM WOULD JUST.

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.996
EXPLORE THOSE AND I THINK WE CAN

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:55.364
WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.565
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT CREATIVE

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.767
WAYS ON HOW TO HOW TO SUPPORT

01:13:58.834 --> 01:13:59.501
THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:00.402
INTEREST.

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:01.470
IN MAKING SURE YOU KNOW CLEARLY

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:02.337
THESE THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:04.306
<u>&lt;c.red&gt;DENTIFIED AS PEOPLE WHO REALLY&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:06.141
SHOULDN'T HAVE FIREARMS FOR THE

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.142
REASON.

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:08.610
THAT WE REALLY -- WORK TOGETHER

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:11.380
STATE AND LOCAL TO MAKE SURE

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:12.681
THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:13.916
DISARMED AND THERE'S BUSINESS

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:15.384
SOME REASON.

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:16.618
THEY'RE NOT DISARMED I MEAN I

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:19.121
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT MISTER

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:21.190
CHAIRMAN ON THAT ON THAT POINT --

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:25.327
I HOPE YOU WHAT YOU'LL KEEP IN

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:25.527
MIND.

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:26.361
IS THAT [inaudible]

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:27.696
LOCAL AGENCIES.

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:28.864
CANNOT DO THIS THEMSELVES IF

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:31.033
THEY TRY IF THEY SAY YOU HELP US

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:32.401
BY GIVING US RESOURCE TO DO THIS

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:34.636
THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THE MOMENT --

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:35.804
ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LEAVES

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.673
YOUR JURISDICTION THEY HAVE TO

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.141
STOP AND SO.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:40.876
IT HAD IF FORCES ALL OF US TO

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:42.878
COORDINATE AND AGAIN TEN YEARS

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:45.147
AGO THERE WERE ABOUT NINE

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:48.250
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WERE --

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.985
OWNING FIREARMS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:51.854
TODAY JUST TEN YEARS LATER

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.689
THAT'S TWO AND A HALF MILLION.

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:54.556
AND SO THE NUMBERS ARE

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:56.491
INCREASING AND THAT MEANS MUCH

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:57.793
MORE WORK FOR US AND THAT'S WHY

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.895
IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT WE DO

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.263
COORDINATE.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.631
AND COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL LAW

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:03.165
ENFORCEMENT -- THERE'S A

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:04.333
QUESTION TO DETER THERE'S A

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:06.835
REASON WHY YOUR YOUR THE HOLDER

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:07.936

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.726

IT'S IT'S BUT IT'S REALLY A

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.531
PARTNERSHIP?

RETRIEVAL AT THE TIME OF OF THE

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:01.523
DECISION THAT'S MADE THAT THEY

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:09.164
OF COURT DATES AND THOSE KINDS

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:10.899
OF THINGS.

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:12.768
IN MY PARTY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:14.903
ANSWER THAN I DO ON THAT -- I'M

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:15.470

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.073
THESE FOLKS ARE WHAT THEY THE

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.442
BURDEN OF FIFTY ONE FIFTY BILL

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.176
KIND OF MENTAL.

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.878
ISSUES THAT ARE THERE AND THEY

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.713

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.915
NOT BASICALLY ON AND IN JAIL OR

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:29.051
UNDER SUPERVISION OR THEY'RE NOT

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:30.152

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:31.420
SO WHO SHE SAID WHAT DO YOU DO

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:34.356
ABOUT THEM AND I I ASSUME --

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:35.924
THIS CONSIDERATION FOR THAT SO

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:37.025
WE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:40.095
MEASURE WE WE WE CAN ONLY PURSUE

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:41.430
FOLKS WHO UNDER THE LAW.

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:43.365
FIT THE CRITERIA AS PEOPLE WHO

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.766
HAVE LOST THE RIGHT TO POSSESS

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.034
WEAPONS.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:49.604
AND SO WHETHER SOMEONE -- COMES

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:50.772
OUT OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THEIR

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:52.040
TIME FOR EXAMPLE UNDER TO

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:53.976
DOMESTIC RESTRAINING ORDER ENDS

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.744

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.846
KIND OF A JUDICATA -- THAT

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:00.015
THERE'S A MENTAL -- DISABILITY

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:00.983
THAT MAKES A PERSON DANGER TO

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:02.918
HIMSELF OR OTHERS WE CAN'T

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.586
PURSUE THOSE FOLKS WE HAVE TO

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:05.754
THEY HAVE TO FIT WITHIN THE

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.889
DEFINITIONS OF THE SUBJECTS.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:10.625
THAT ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.461
POSSESS WEAPONS.

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:14.229
YOU MENTION ANY IN YOUR COMMENTS.

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.832
SOMETHING ABOUT -- I THINK SENT

01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:18.500
AND MY COLLEAGUE HE WAS TALKING

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:19.401
ABOUT IT SOMETHING ABOUT THE

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:23.205
RAPE KITS YES AND I I'M SURE

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:25.374
YOU'RE AWARE OF THEWAS THE LAST

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.042

THE BRAKE KITS.

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:30.245
AND THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEM

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.347
THAT WE'VE ORDERED MOST OF THEM

01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:33.715
TO BE TESTED.

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:34.349
BUT THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:35.350
WITH SOME.

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.419
OF ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH WHAT'S

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:38.820
GOING ON WITH THAT AND AND WHAT

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:40.055
RESOLUTION.

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:41.656
OUGHT TO OCCUR WITH REGARDS TO

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.392
THAT WE WERE SOMEWHAT SHOCKED AT

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.160
THE NOTED THAT THE NUMBER THAT

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:47.229
IS OUT THE IN THE AFTER WE PUT

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.730
RESOURCES INTO.

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:50.132
OF TELLING FOLKS THAT THEY HAVE

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.967
TO BE CITIZENS THESE KIDS NEED

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:53.869
TO BE TESTED AND FOLKS GET UP IN

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:54.903
TESTAMENT IN THE DO NOTHING WITH

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:57.105
THE THE THE THE THE HITS THAT

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.640
COMEY AND THAT COULD PROBABLY

01:17:58.707 --> 01:17:59.408
PREVENT.

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.376
OF CRIMES FROM OCCURRING OR AT

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:03.678
LEAST EVEN OF HELP FOLKS WHO

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:06.515
BEEN UNFAIRLY -- CONVICTED OF

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:07.382
CRIMES THAT THEY DID NOT COMMIT

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:07.949
SO.

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.818
OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH ALL

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:11.219
OF THAT THAT WAS VERY

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:12.854
FRUSTRATING FOR US TO HEAR THAT

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.823
AT THE SAME TIME -- AT LEAST I

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:17.559
WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE IS IS THAT

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:19.094
IS THE ISSUE IS THE IS THE

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:20.929
DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE ALAMEDA

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:21.897
COUNTY.

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:24.199
OF SITUATION OF THE DIDN'T HAVE

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:25.667
A BACKLOG OF WITH REGARDS TO

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:27.836
BRAKE KITS AND HAS USED A MALL

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:29.504
FOR WHATEVER PROSECUTION AND SO

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:30.172
FORTH AND SO ON IT THEY'RE GOING

01:18:30.238 --> 01:18:32.274
TO USE -- INDICATED THAT IT'S

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.875
REALLY A MATTER OF WILL THAT

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:35.677
FOLKS HAVE TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:37.145
TO GET THIS DONE AND I KNOW

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.947
THEY'VE BEEN SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:40.248
AND BILLS FROM WOMEN.

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:41.550
IN THE ASSEMBLY OF GETTING THIS

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:43.285
DONE AND SO WOULD NOW AT A POINT

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:44.119
WHERE.

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:45.787
WE STILL FIND OURSELVES A

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:47.789
WITHOUT THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:48.824
FROM THESE RAPE KITS.

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.859
VENTURE SO LIKE THE SITUATION

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.862
WITH THE FIREARMS HELD BY PEOPLE

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:54.796
WHO ARE PROHIBITED.

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:55.230
UP.

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:56.731
THERE ISN'T A SPECIFIC

01:18:56.798 --> 01:18:58.133
REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL LAW

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.402
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO DO

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:01.803
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR WITH US

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:02.804
ON THE ON FIREARMS.

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:04.039
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE RAPE

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:06.508
KITS THEY GO THROUGH THEM AS

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:09.111
THEY DEEM -- APPROPRIATE AND SO

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:15.817
THERE HAS GROWN UP A BACKLOG OF

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:16.852
SOME OF THESE KIDS HAS GROWN.

01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:17.853
MANY OF THOSE AGENCIES.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.155
ASK OUR FRIENDS X. -- US BUREAU

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:20.989
FORENSIC SERVICES TO DO THE

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:21.556
ANALYSIS OF SOME OF THOSE

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:24.392
EVIDENCE KITS AND WE DO AND SO

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:25.994
WHEN I MENTIONED THAT WE HAD WE

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.629
ARE OVER THE COURSE OF TWENTY

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:29.731
EIGHTEEN PERFORMED -- ANALYSIS

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:31.733
OF THOSE KIDS WE DID ABOUT

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.267
TWENTY SIX HUNDRED SO THE

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:34.236
REQUEST THAT WE GOT WE PROCESSED

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:35.270
ALL OF THOSE.

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:36.671
THERE ARE SOME AGENCIES THAT ARE

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:39.274
STILL HOLDING SOME OF THESE KIDS.

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:40.675
IN SOME CASES FOR A LONGER TIME

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:41.176
THAN SOME PEOPLE THINK

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:43.011
REASONABLE AND IT'S UP TO THOSE

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.713
AGENCIES TO TRY TO GET THEM

01:19:44.779 --> 01:19:45.380
ANALYZED.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:47.249
AND SO THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:50.385
TRIED TO PROVIDE THE IMPETUS FOR

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.020
FOR THAT TO BE DONE SOONER AND

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.555
IN SOME CASES RESOURCES ARE

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:54.856
GONNA HELP SOME OF THESE LOCAL

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:56.491
AGENCIES DO SO AS WELL.

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:57.959
AND WE WE MAY RUN INTO A

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.594
SITUATION WHERE WE CAN'T KEEP UP

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.296
AS WELL IF TOO MANY THESE

01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:02.864
AGENCIES START COMING TO US.

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:04.166
BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:06.368
FORENSIC SERVICES HAS ALREADY

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:07.602
BEEN DEPLETED AND IT'S FUNDING

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.704
AND SO OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ON

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:11.206
MORE WILL BE STRAPPED UNLESS WE

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.207
CONTINUE.

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:15.310
TO GET THE RESOURCES WE NEED.

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.912
OKAY.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.280
WELL I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO AT IN

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:20.348
IN LISTENING -- LAST WEEK TO THE

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:22.450
TO IT -- I GUESS AT SOME POINT

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:24.452
THIS BODY WILL HAVE.

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.054
TO DO SOMETHING IN TERMS OF THAT

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:28.890
ONLY BUDGET BUT BUDGET LANGUAGE.

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:30.859
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DO A

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:32.294
TO FOLLOW DO THE FOLLOW THROUGH.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.828
YOU KNOW AS I POINTED OUT

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.630
REMINDS ME WHEN YOU TELL YOU

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:36.264
KßT.

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:37.966
TO SWEEP BECAUSE THEY DROP

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:39.768
SOMETHING A SUITE THAT ONE SPOT

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:40.936
MANDATE THAT DONE INVEST A HOUSE

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.504
LOOK LIKE A DISASTER.

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:43.872
AND AND AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:47.709
SAME WE TOLD ME OF TEST THE TEST.

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:48.543
YOU KNOW LOGIC IS THAT DO BEEN

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:49.611
TAKE IT INTO TO ITS LOGICAL

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.846
CONCLUSION AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:52.814
NOT HAPPENING SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:53.348
HAVE.

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:54.716
TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING WITH

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:56.251
REGARDS TO FUNDING BUT ALSO

01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:57.485
BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE THAT

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:59.020
REQUIRES THEM TO TAKE IT TO ITS

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:00.388
FULL IMPLEMENTATION.

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:02.324
OF THE PURPOSE OF OF DOING THE

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.326
TEST IS TO HOPEFULLY TO PROVE

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:05.694
FIGURE OUT WHO'S COMMITTING THE

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.662
CRIMES AND AND PICK THESE FOLKS

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.598
UP AS WELL AS TO EXONERATE FOLKS

01:21:09.664 --> 01:21:11.199
DIDN'T COMMIT THE CRIME I MEAN.

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:13.435
THAT'S THE LOGIC BEHIND IT AND

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:15.237
AND YET ARE WE GETTING IS IS THE

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:16.838
TEST THEY'RE BEING TESTED

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:18.273
BECAUSE WE TOLD MODESTO.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.341
AND THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:20.742
THROUGH ON THE HITS OR ANYTHING

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:22.544
ELSE FROM THE REPORT THAT WE GOT.

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:23.745
IN LAST WEEK AND SO THAT'S

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:26.147
REALLY KIND OF DISHEARTENING

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:28.383
AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF OF I

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.551
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:30.785
TALK ABOUT THAT WHICH HAS BEEN

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:32.354
SEVERAL WEEKS YEARS AGO NOW.

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.521
AND WE STILL A POOR ALMOST AT

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:35.223
THE SAME SPOT WITH REGARDS TO

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:36.725
PEOPLE FOLLOWING THROUGH AS WE

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:37.659
THOUGHT THEY WOULD LOGICALLY

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.361
FOLLOW THROUGH ONCE THEY GOT

01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:40.495
YOUR OFFICE AND OTHERS TO

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:40.996
PROVIDE THEM WITH THE

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:41.796
INFORMATION.

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:43.164
BUT IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T SOME OUT

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.233
OF THE CORD NATION NOT TRICKLING

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.801
DOWN AND AND ACCOMPLISHING THE

01:21:46.868 --> 01:21:47.369
GOALS THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:50.805
ACCOMPLISH.

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:52.874
BY GETTING THE TEST THAT -- BUT

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:53.508
THAT WE SAW WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:54.709
WITH THE ONE BE A WHO ACTUALLY

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:56.811
MADE IT A PRIORITY TO COMMITMENT.

01:21:56.878 --> 01:21:58.280
TO GET THE TEST HOPE THINGS DONE

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:00.315
AND TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:02.851
AND AND TO HAVE NO BACKLOG IN IN

01:22:02.917 --> 01:22:05.520
THE BAY AREA WITH WITH REGARDS --

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:06.554
TO THE RAPE KITS AND THE FOLLOW

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:08.156
THROUGH AND HITS AND EVERYTHING

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:09.324
ELSE THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.458
PEOPLE WOULD DO.

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:13.061
YOU KNOW BUT SHE SAID SHE HAD A

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:14.596
COMMITMENT TO GET IT DONE.

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:15.497
SO WHAT WILL FIT ANY OTHER

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:17.832
QUESTIONS YES MISTER JONES

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:20.502
SAWYER.

IT IS OCT.

01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:23.204
I APOLOGIZE FOR FOR BEING SO

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:24.572
LATE AND IF THIS.

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:26.007
QUESTION IS ALREADY BEEN BEEN

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:28.109
ASSN ANSWER OUT OF A WASH THE

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:31.012
FILLMORE SMOKES PLAYED TO ME

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:32.914
LATER -- IT'S NOT JUST FIRST

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:35.817
MAKE MAKE A COMMENT ON THE ARM

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:38.086
TO PROHIBIT PERSON SYSTEM --

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:39.087
GOOD TO SEE YOU MISTER DURING

01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:41.589
GENERAL OF I'VE HAD.

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:44.859
IN PUBLIC SAFETY POLICY -- I'VE

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:46.528
HAD MEMBERS WANTING TO CREATE

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:48.129
THEIR OWN [inaudible]

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:50.131
INDIVIDUAL [inaudible]

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:55.103
DEPARTMENT -- APPS SYSTEM OR

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:56.004
WHATEVER.

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:58.340
AND I'VE OF KIND OF HELD IT BACK

01:22:58.406 --> 01:22:59.474
BECAUSE OF FROM A POLICY

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:01.443
PERSPECTIVE.

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:01.976
AND ALSO FROM A MANAGEMENT

01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:04.713
PERSPECTIVE OF ALWAYS FELT THAT --

01:23:04.779 --> 01:23:06.414
I THINK I TELL YOU THAT THAT I I

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:08.516
PREFER ONE PERSON TO BLAME ONE

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:09.951
PERSON TO GET SUCCESS.

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:13.054
OF WHEN YOU SPREAD THINGS OVER.

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:15.523
DIFFERENT SHERIFFS ARE DIFFERENT

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.824
[inaudible]

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.760
AGENCIES ARM WHEN -- SOMEONE

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:21.129
ASKED WHY DIDN'T WORK PEOPLE

01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:21.730
STOP POINTING FINGERS AND YOU

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:22.731
GOT.

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:24.199
YOU KNOW FOR FIVE DIFFERENT

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.668
AGENCIES WORKING ON THIS AND

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:29.738
FOUR OUT OF FIVE OUR SUCCESSFUL --

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:31.706
YOU'VE GOT TO BLAME FOR PEOPLE

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:33.141
FIVE PEOPLE WHAT THE ART YOU GO

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.709
BACK TO LEGISLATION SO WHY DO

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:35.944
YOU DO THAT THE FIRST PLACE.

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.046
AND SO ON I THINK WE TALKED

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:41.416
ABOUT THIS -- I WAS HERE.

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:43.518
IN TWENTY TWELVE TALKING ABOUT

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:44.352
THIS.

01:23:44.419 --> 01:23:47.789
AND MIGHT MIGHT. ONE I'M LETTING

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.524
YOU KNOW THAT -- IS PROBABLY

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:50.792
SOME MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY NOT

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.360
VERY HAPPY WITH ME BECAUSE WE'RE

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:53.528
NOT DOING.

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:54.896
THIS BECAUSE I FIRMLY BUT DO

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:56.865
BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE REST

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:58.333
IN.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.502
ONE DEPARTMENT ONE ONE AREA I

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:01.836
THINK YOU WERE WILD WHEN I CAME

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:02.971
IN YOU CAN I ANSWERED SOME OF

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:04.839
THE REASONS WHY WE NEED TO GET

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:06.274
THAT OUT TO OTHER MEMBERS.

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:08.376
A WIDE IS IS MORE IMPORTANT TO

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:10.545
KEEP IT FOCUS UNDER ONE PERSON'S

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:11.546
LEADERSHIP.

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:13.882
OTHERWISE -- IT STILL MAY NOT

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:16.151
GET DONE -- THAT'S ONE THING AND

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:17.352
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DO ACTUALLY

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:19.687
WORK WITH LOCAL MISS BELLY TO

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:23.625
MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE -- THAT

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:24.692
AND IN MY ONLY QUESTION IS --

01:24:24.759 --> 01:24:26.661
WHAT'S WHAT IS WHAT WILL BE THE

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.196
DIFFERENCE.

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:30.532
BETWEEN WHAT THE EFFORT THAT WAS

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:35.637
DONE BACK IN 200-012-1314.

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:38.006
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YOU CAME ON WHAT.

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:39.274
SEVENTEEN WHAT'S WHAT IS GOING

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.842
TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE MONEY

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.277
WE PUT IN LAST TIME THAT THE

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:44.746
ACTIVITY WE PUT AWAY WHAT IS.

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:46.948
WHAT IS THAT DELTA DIFFERENCE

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.716
BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO?

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.952
AND WHAT WAS ATTEMPTED BEFORE TO

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:54.155
GET US TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO.

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:55.890
SOME REMEMBER AS A GREAT

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:56.491
QUESTION AND I WOULD TELL YOU

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:57.325
THAT.

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:58.960
MY HOPE IS THAT WHAT WE CAN

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:00.862
PRODUCE FOR MOVING FORWARD IF WE

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.731
GET THIS UP BUDGET REQUEST IT

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:05.467
HELPS TO SORT OF BUT THE DECK IN

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:06.134
ORDER.

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:08.136
IS EFFICIENCY THAT WE WILL

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:10.538
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO COORDINATE

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.106
WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:14.776
MAKE YOU WE MIGHT NEED YOUR HELP.

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:16.444
TO THE TOP.

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:17.745
GIVE A PUSH TO LOCAL LAW

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:19.147
ENFORCEMENT EIGHTY TO WANT TO DO

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:20.715
THIS THEY'RE GONNA COME TO YOU

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.517
AND RIGHTFULLY SO MANY CASES SAY.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.018
YOU WANT US TO GET INVOLVED IT'S

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.086
GONNA TAKE SOME RESOURCES

01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:26.488
BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE GO

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:27.755
RETRIEVE A WEAPON.

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:28.990
WE'RE NOT HAVING SOMEBODY PATROL

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.091
STREET.

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:32.293
AND SO IT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.628
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:35.330
FIGURE OUT THE MOST EFFICIENT

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:37.265
WAY TO COORDINATE SO IT.

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:39.033
LOOKS LIKE MY ARM.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.668
TECH APPREHEND FOLKS.

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:42.437
IS MUCH LONGER AND BIGGER AND

01:25:42.504 --> 01:25:43.404
WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:45.073
WITH THE FEW TEAMS I HAVE TO DO

01:25:45.139 --> 01:25:46.474
THIS.

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:47.108
FOLKS KNOW IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:47.942
FOR ME TO FIND.

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:49.511
BUT IF I KNOW THERE'S A NETWORK

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.446
OUT THERE THAT I'M WORKING WITH

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:51.946
THAT WE'RE COORDINATING

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:52.680
OFFICIALLY.

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.148
THAT'S WHAT REALLY WORKS FIRST

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:56.150
IS AS YOU SAID IF ONE AGENCY

01:25:56.217 --> 01:25:56.784
SAID LET ME TAKE IT ALL ON MY

01:25:56.851 --> 01:25:57.619
OWN.

01:25:57.685 --> 01:25:58.453
AND THEN THE MOMENT THAT

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.154
PERSON'S STEPS OVER THE BOUNDARY

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.789
THAT PERSON'S JURISDICTION YOU

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:03.091
KNOW LA COUNTY SHERIFF.

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:04.359
CAN'T GOING TO ORANGE COUNTY AS

01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:05.994
I SAID BEFORE AND THEY ALL THEY

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.062
KNOW IS THAT THE BAD GUYS KNOW

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:08.663
THE AGE THAT THE STEP OVER THE

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:09.764
COUNTY LINE.

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:10.832
AND THE CASHIER CAN'T TOUCH HIM

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:11.699
ANYMORE.

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:13.668
BE IT BECOMES INEFFICIENT AND SO

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:14.302
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS COORDINATE

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:15.136
SO THAT.

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:16.337
LA COUNTY SAYS I'M ABOUT THE

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:17.872
PURSUE SOMEBODY LOOKS LIKE IT'S

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:18.540
ABOUT THE GOING TO ORANGE COUNTY

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:19.908
AS TO HOW WE GOT A WORKING

01:26:19.974 --> 01:26:21.175
RELATIONSHIP WITH ORANGE COUNTY

01:26:21.242 --> 01:26:22.777
ORANGE COUNTY.

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.445
TAKES OVER FROM THERE AND THEN

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:25.847
WE DON'T HAVE TO MY TEAM DOES IT

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.315
HAVE TO ALWAYS BE ON THE GROUND.

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:29.150
BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT THERE'S GOT

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:32.020
TO BE -- SOMEONE AT THE POINT OF

01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:33.321
THE SPEAR AND THAT'S WHERE

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.856
SPECIAL AGENTS HAVE BEEN AT THE

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:35.890
POINT OF THE SPEAR AND WITH YOUR

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:37.492
HELP WHAT WILL END UP DOING I

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:38.960
HOPE IS COORDINATING.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.595
AND WITH YOUR HELP ALTHOUGH THIS

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:41.396
IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:42.163
DIRECTLY DO.

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:44.065
BUT MAYBE THE MORAL SUASION YOU

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:45.800
CAN PROVIDE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:47.702
THE STATE RECOGNIZES THAT I

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:50.238
CAN'T DO SOMETHING.

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:51.706
WHEN I GATICA A MEDIC

01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:53.107
COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TRYING

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:54.075
TO GET THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:26:54.142 --> 01:26:55.310
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT WORK?

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.078
AND IF I CAN'T BE MY AGENT

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.880
SOMETHING NEAR WHAT THEY DESERVE

01:26:58.947 --> 01:27:01.583
GIVEN THAT THE HEIGHT OF DANGER

01:27:01.649 --> 01:27:03.551
THAT THEY'RE IN -- I'M NOT GONNA

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:06.454
GET A AND SO WE WE JUST NEED TO

01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:07.789
MAKE IT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT.

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:09.090
WE WANT TO WE WANT TO GET THE

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.792
BEST.

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:11.726
HARD TO GET THE BEST IF I PAY

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:14.262
THE WORST.

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:19.601
WELL IS WITH THE WITH THE

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:23.905
TESTING A RAPE KIT -- WE COULD

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:25.273
PROVIDE.

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.374
ALL THE MONIES THAT WE NEED ON

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:29.043
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:30.445
BUT IF THEY'RE NOT COOPERATING

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:31.913
IF YOU'RE NOT DOING YOU KNOW

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.681
I'VE THE REASON I'M LATE.

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.350
IS BECAUSE OF A A BILL I'M

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:39.187
WORKING ON IN THE MORNING AT

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:40.488
EIGHT THIRTY WERE BY -- I THINK

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:42.190
THIS COMMITTEE GAVE TWENTY FIVE

01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:44.392
MILLION TO HELP RESOLVE JUMPING

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:45.994
AND HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT DO IT

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:46.894
ON THEIR OWN.

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:49.130
WHICH THEY DIDN'T TOUCH.

01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:50.565
IN SOME ALSO WORRIED ABOUT

01:27:50.632 --> 01:27:52.233
GIVING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.335
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:56.304
AND THEN HAVE THEM NOT USE.

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:58.206
YOU DO WE GIVE YOU ALL THE

01:27:58.272 --> 01:27:59.907
RESOURCES YOU NEED.

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.643
BUT THEN THEY DON'T CONNECT WITH

01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:03.211
YOU SO IT'S IT'S IT'S MORE THAN

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:05.380
JUST.

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:08.249
YOU IT'S IS ALSO THE LOCAL LAW

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:08.783

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:10.885
PRIORITY.

MOVE FORWARD WITH.

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:17.959
AND SO -- WE WE WE NEED TO LOOK

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:19.127
AT THAT TOO BECAUSE THAT'S

01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:21.429
OTHERWISE WE HAVE.

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:23.331
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT IS

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:24.532
EITHER UNSPENT.

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.401

PLACE THAT WE ARE HERE RIGHT NOW

KIND OF AN OVERVIEW OF OUR

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:17.537
ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE VERY

01:51:17.604 --> 01:51:19.572
QUICKLY -- I JUST WANNA TALK --

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:21.274
ABOUT THE FUNDING IN THE ACTUAL

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:23.576
EXPENDITURES FOR THE DEPARTMENT --

01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:24.944
IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET

01:51:25.011 --> 01:51:26.546
ACT -- YES RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE

01:51:26.613 --> 01:51:27.380
MILLION FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.282
REDUCTION FUND -- IT WAS VERY

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:31.117
LIMITED TO PRE POSITIONING FOR

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:34.320
ONLY FIRE -- EVENTS -- SO AND I

01:51:34.387 --> 01:51:36.156
KNOW D. G. R. FUNDING IS A

01:51:36.222 --> 01:51:37.390
LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:38.024
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEY HAVE TO

01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:39.692
MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA WHICH IS

01:51:39.759 --> 01:51:41.027
WHY THERE WAS LIMITED FUNDING

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:41.895
EXPENDED THERE.

01:51:41.961 --> 01:51:43.196
I THINK THEY'RE STILL SPENDING

01:51:43.263 --> 01:51:45.665
OUT OF IT NOW -- IN THE TWENTY

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:46.933
EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT -- THE

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.001
FUNDING THAT WAS ORIGINALLY

01:51:48.068 --> 01:51:49.402
PROVIDED THROUGH PROVISIONAL

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:51.438
LANGUAGE HOW TO WRESTLING WHICH

01:51:51.504 --> 01:51:52.572
ARE REQUIRED TO USE ON EQUIPMENT

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:58.611
AND TOOLS -- AND SO.

01:51:58.678 --> 01:51:59.679
I THEN WENT SB NINE A ONE CAME

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:00.346
ALONG IT REVISE THAT PROVISIONAL

01:52:00.413 --> 01:52:00.980
LANGUAGE TO ALLOW IT TO BE USED

01:52:01.047 --> 01:52:02.048
ON ALL TYPES OF HAZARDS.

01:52:02.115 --> 01:52:03.149
SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ONLY

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:04.484
HAD JUST A FEW MONTHS TO START

01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:05.652
SPENDING THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:52:05.718 --> 01:52:08.588
DOLLARS DOWN FOR PRE POSITIONING

01:52:08.655 --> 01:52:09.622
SPECIFICALLY.

01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:11.624
HER ANY COMMENTS WELL L. JUST A

01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:13.526
COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS. ONE IS

01:52:13.593 --> 01:52:14.427
THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT DIDN'T

01:52:14.494 --> 01:52:15.462
COME WITH A BUDGET CHANGE

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:16.763
PROPOSAL AND SO WE HAVE SOME

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.431
COMMENTS ABOUT THIS AS WELL AS

01:52:18.498 --> 01:52:19.899
OTHER PROPOSALS AND THAT AND

01:52:19.966 --> 01:52:21.835
THAT GENERAL -- CATEGORY OF

01:52:21.901 --> 01:52:23.069
PROPOSALS THAT DIDN'T COME WITH

01:52:23.136 --> 01:52:24.671
THE THAT DOCUMENTATION --

01:52:24.737 --> 01:52:26.072
BASICALLY WE THINK IT'S MORE

01:52:26.139 --> 01:52:29.476
DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:31.010
EVALUATE THOSE PROPOSALS.

01:52:31.077 --> 01:52:31.878
SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE

01:52:31.945 --> 01:52:32.378
LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE

01:52:32.445 --> 01:52:33.513
DEPARTMENT TO SUBMIT FUTURE

01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:35.014
PROPOSALS THEIR SUBSTANTIVE LIKE

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:36.349
THIS -- ONE WITH BUDGET CHAIN

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:37.984
PROPOSALS THE SECOND JUST

01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:38.918
SPECIFICALLY ON THE PRE

01:52:38.985 --> 01:52:41.054
POSITIONING -- WE HAD JUST NOTED

01:52:41.121 --> 01:52:42.188
THAT IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT

01:52:42.255 --> 01:52:43.890
THE ON GOING LEVEL OF RESOURCES

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:45.892
WILL BE NEEDED AS FINANCE

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:47.460
INDICATED -- THERE IT'S

01:52:47.527 --> 01:52:48.828
CERTAINLY THIS IS A BREAK A VERY

01:52:48.895 --> 01:52:50.897
VERY NEW PROGRAM AND THE LAST

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:52.065
TWO YEARS SPENDING BEEN PROVIDED

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:53.366
THERE BEEN SOME REASONS WHY IT'S

01:52:53.433 --> 01:52:54.300
TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO

01:52:54.367 --> 01:52:54.868
GET UP.

01:52:54.934 --> 01:52:56.603
AND RUNNING BUT IN SEVENTEEN

01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:57.470
EIGHTEEN ONLY ABOUT FOUR MILLION

01:52:57.537 --> 01:52:58.771
HAS BEEN EXPENDED OUT OF THAT

01:52:58.838 --> 01:52:59.873
TWENTY FIVE MILLION.

01:52:59.939 --> 01:53:02.208
AND THEN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:53:02.275 --> 01:53:02.842
TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONLY ABOUT

01:53:02.909 --> 01:53:04.010
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION HAS BEEN

01:53:04.077 --> 01:53:05.612
EXPENDED SO FAR CERTAINLY THEY

01:53:05.678 --> 01:53:07.380
MAKE THEY MAY NEED QUITE A BIT

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:08.581
MORE THAN THAT ON AN ONGOING

01:53:08.648 --> 01:53:10.350
BASIS IT'S JUST VERY DIFFICULT

01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:11.317
THE TALENT SO.

01:53:11.384 --> 01:53:12.785
WE JUST WANTED TO FLAG THAT FOR

01:53:12.852 --> 01:53:14.687
THE LEGISLATURE OKAY.

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:19.559
IN A CART QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:20.960
YES THE SYSTEM.

01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:23.530
THANK YOU I PERSONAL ME SAY THIS

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:25.064
IS A VERY NECESSARY FUNDING IN

01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:26.533
THE FORTIES CAME WITH A BIT MORE

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:27.133
LAST YEAR WITH WHAT THEY HAD.

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:27.800
REQUESTED AND I THINK WE SHOULD

01:53:27.867 --> 01:53:28.668
TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY THE

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:30.103
CHALLENGE THOUGH.

01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:32.438
IN OUR BUDGETING PROCESS IS

01:53:32.505 --> 01:53:34.641
PUTTING A BLOCK OF MONEY THERE

01:53:34.707 --> 01:53:36.442
THAT'S WELL INTENDED.

01:53:36.509 --> 01:53:38.912
AND THEN BEING ABLE TO

01:53:38.978 --> 01:53:40.547
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS USED FOR

01:53:40.613 --> 01:53:42.882
AND THEN HOW THAT USE HELP SAYS

01:53:42.949 --> 01:53:43.783
PREDICTS.

01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:44.984
IN THE FUTURE.

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:47.487
AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO

01:53:47.554 --> 01:53:48.755
HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:50.056
AVAILABLE THAT'S ONE THING I

01:53:50.123 --> 01:53:51.591
THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS REQUEST

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:52.759
REALLY IS.

01:53:52.825 --> 01:53:53.793
BUT THEN TO GET KIND OF REPORTS

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.929
BACK ON DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE

01:53:55.995 --> 01:53:57.897
OF WHERE TO PRE POSITION AND

01:53:57.964 --> 01:53:59.399
WHAT WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS WERE.

01:53:59.465 --> 01:54:01.334
I CAN AND WHAT HAPPENED.

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:04.837
NOT IN A WAY [inaudible] TO

01:54:04.904 --> 01:54:06.272
OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE TO PREDICT THE

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:08.174
FUTURE BUT TO BE ABLE TO BETTER

01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:09.676
UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS USED TO

01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:11.277
THAT AS THESE COMES THROUGH THAT

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:12.312
WE CAN THEN.

01:54:12.378 --> 01:54:13.446
HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THE

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:14.948
DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE TO

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.416
SPEND THAT MONEY AND TO USE THAT

01:54:16.482 --> 01:54:17.784
MONEY.

01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:20.486
I WOULD HATE FOR US TO BE.

01:54:20.553 --> 01:54:21.454
PUTTING THIS MONEY ASIDE IN THE

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:24.190
DOWNLINE GET CRITICIZED FOR ITS

01:54:24.257 --> 01:54:25.458
AVAILABILITY.

01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:26.826
WHEN IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW IT

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:29.028
ULTIMATELY GETS USED BUT I THINK

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:30.063
IF WE LOOK AT IT AS AN

01:54:30.129 --> 01:54:30.797
INVESTMENT?

01:54:30.863 --> 01:54:32.932
IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND IN THE

01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:34.167
PROTECTION THAT IT REPRESENTS

01:54:34.234 --> 01:54:35.702
AND THEN BE ABLE TO TIE.

01:54:35.768 --> 01:54:37.570
AND SOMETIMES WE MAY HAVE SPENT

01:54:37.637 --> 01:54:38.538
SOME MONEY.

01:54:38.605 --> 01:54:40.273
AND IT DIDN'T TURN OUT TO HAVE

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:42.308
BEEN NEEDED THAT'S NOT A BAD

01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:43.142
THING THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD

01:54:43.209 --> 01:54:43.509
THING.

01:54:43.576 --> 01:54:45.111
BECAUSE THAT MEANT THERE WAS NOT

01:54:45.178 --> 01:54:46.713
NECESSARILY DISASTER OR THE

01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:48.147
DISASTER I'M HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE

01:54:48.214 --> 01:54:49.015
ABLE TO BUILD SOME CASES WHERE

01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:50.783
WE SHOULD THE DESK DISASTER WAS

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:51.584
AVERTED.

01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:53.419
WHERE IF FIRE EQUIPMENT OR

01:54:53.486 --> 01:54:55.021
MERGED EQUIPMENT IS ABLE TO

01:54:55.088 --> 01:54:57.190
SOLVE A PROBLEM EARLY ON?

01:54:57.257 --> 01:54:59.759
THEN MAYBE WE WON'T SEE SOME OF

01:54:59.826 --> 01:55:00.927
THESE HUGE CORPORATIONS THAT.

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:03.062
HAVE ENDED UP BECAUSE THE

01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:04.497
RESOURCES WEREN'T ABLE TO BE

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:05.765
THERE.

01:55:05.832 --> 01:55:07.233
I'M NOT SURE HOW WE ARTICULATE

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:10.136
THAT OR HOW WE BUILD THAT INTO.

01:55:10.203 --> 01:55:11.504
BUDGET LANGUAGE WHICH IS REALLY

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:13.373
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:55:13.439 --> 01:55:15.541
SO HAVING A FUND AVAILABLE I

01:55:15.608 --> 01:55:16.075
DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH OF A

01:55:16.142 --> 01:55:17.744
PROBLEM FOR IT BUT BEING ABLE TO

01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:20.680
LOOK AND AND UNDERSTAND HOW IT

01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:22.682
WAS GETTING USED AS AS MAYBE A

01:55:22.749 --> 01:55:23.983
PREDICTOR IN OVERTIME WE'LL

01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.917
LEARN MORE.

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:26.419
AS A PREDICTOR FOR HOW IT MIGHT

01:55:26.486 --> 01:55:29.255
BE USED AND MIGHT BE BETTER USE

01:55:29.322 --> 01:55:29.856
THAT'S A CONVERSATION I THINK

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:31.024
THAT.

01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:34.093
VERY HELPFUL AND VERY USEFUL SO

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.695
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TOOL.

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:37.163
BUT I THINK WE ALL NEED TO LEARN

01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:38.498
HOW TO USE IT WHAT THE

01:55:38.564 --> 01:55:40.700
IMPLICATIONS ARE AND THEN HOW TO

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:42.068
KEEP MAKING SURE.

01:55:42.135 --> 01:55:44.037
THAT WE CAN BELIEVE SOME MONEY

01:55:44.103 --> 01:55:46.439
AVAILABLE WHICH IN GOVERNMENT

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:48.174
PARLANCE IS A BIT OF A SCARY

01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:49.142
THING THEY'RE LEAVING MONEY

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:50.176
AVAILABLE.

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:52.178
HIGHLY.

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:55.114
EASILY TARGETED FOR CRITICISM.

01:55:55.181 --> 01:55:56.449
BUT FOR US TO THEN BE ABLE TO GO

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:57.216
BACK OKAY THIS IS HOW IT WAS

01:55:57.283 --> 01:55:59.118
USED THESE ARE THE BENEFITS THAT

01:55:59.185 --> 01:56:02.889
WE SAW FROM IT -- ALLOWS US TO

01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:03.990
KIND OF KEEP THIS PROGRAM GOING.

01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:05.992
DIFFICULT THING POTENTIALLY THE

01:56:06.059 --> 01:56:07.527
THREAD BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY

01:56:07.593 --> 01:56:08.861
VERY IMPORTANT SO I PREACH

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:10.096
PREACHY THE PRESENTATION I

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:11.064
APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS EARLY

01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:11.764
DAYS.

01:56:11.831 --> 01:56:13.666
IN THIS AND THAT WERE JUST

01:56:13.733 --> 01:56:16.536
PUTTING MONEY OUT THERE BUT I

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:17.203
FOR ONE WAS SUPPORT OF LAST YEAR

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.804
OF THEM.

01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:19.305
OF THE REQUEST FOR THE FOR THE

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:20.573
FIRE CHIEFS WAS WE ASK THEM.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.208
WHAT WOULD YOU NEED TO HELP US

01:56:22.275 --> 01:56:23.376
PROVIDE SOME OF THESE AND THEY

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:25.078
SAID HER MILLION DOLLARS?

01:56:25.144 --> 01:56:26.412
LESS PRE POSITION LETTERS USE

01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:27.313
THAT PREDICTIVE TOOLS THAT ARE

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:29.349
OUT THERE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE

01:56:29.415 --> 01:56:30.650
OF WHAT THAT GETS USED FOR BUT I

01:56:30.717 --> 01:56:31.751
THINK.

01:56:31.818 --> 01:56:33.953
IF WELL SPENT WE CAN TRACK THE

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:35.788
BENEFIT AND WE CAN SEE THE

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:36.089
INVESTMENT.

01:56:36.155 --> 01:56:38.791
IN BEING ABLE.

01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:40.727
TO ADDRESS ISSUES BEFORE THEY

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:41.794
COME BACK IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING

01:56:41.861 --> 01:56:44.063
TO WORK UNFORTUNATELY BUT OFTEN

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:44.764
IT MIGHT.

01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:46.532
SO I'M NOT SURE HOW WE DO THAT

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:48.000
BUT I THINK THAT'S A WORTHY

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:51.304
INQUIRY AND SOMETHING THAT WE

01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:54.040
SHOULD DEFINITELY KEEP TRACK OF

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:55.441
OKAY.

01:56:55.508 --> 01:56:56.542
IN THE COMMENTS ON THAT.

01:56:56.609 --> 01:56:59.112
I TOTALLY AGREE THAT -- IT IS AN

01:56:59.178 --> 01:57:00.546
INVESTMENT I CALLED IT AN

01:57:00.613 --> 01:57:02.782
INSURANCE POLICY.

01:57:02.849 --> 01:57:04.150
IT IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:06.886
COMMUNITIES BY BEING ABLE -- TO

01:57:06.953 --> 01:57:10.990
POSITION -- MORE RESOURCES TO

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:12.725
HAVE THAT AVAILABILITY WE DO

01:57:12.792 --> 01:57:14.794
HAVE SOME IT SUCCESS STORIES

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:16.662
THAT WE CAN BRING BACK IN AND

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:18.097
SHARE WITH YOU.

01:57:18.164 --> 01:57:20.099
AND I THINK THE PROBLEM

01:57:20.166 --> 01:57:22.468
EMERGENCY RESPONSE AS WE DON'T

01:57:22.535 --> 01:57:23.669
HAVE THAT CRYSTAL BALL.

01:57:23.736 --> 01:57:26.305
AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:57:26.372 --> 01:57:27.774
WE DON'T KNOW.

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:30.943
BUT THE STORIES THAT WE CAN TELL

01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:33.413
BY BEING ABLE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL

01:57:33.479 --> 01:57:35.415
RESOURCES IN A FIRE CHEESE BACK

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:36.883
POCKET IN A COMMUNITY THAT'S

01:57:36.949 --> 01:57:39.719
FACING CRITICAL FIRE DANGER.

01:57:39.786 --> 01:57:43.723
IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER -- YOU

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:45.691
KNOW WE WE CAN TELL THAT STORY

01:57:45.758 --> 01:57:47.427
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO RESPOND SO

01:57:47.493 --> 01:57:49.061
MANY MORE UNITS WE WERE ABLE TO

01:57:49.128 --> 01:57:51.664
CONTAIN THE FIRE AT THIS SIZE.

01:57:51.731 --> 01:57:53.099
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY RUN SOME

01:57:53.166 --> 01:57:55.668
PREDICTIVE -- MODELING ON WHAT

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:58.471
THE FIRE WOULD HAVE DONE IF

01:57:58.538 --> 01:58:00.606
THERE WAS NO ACTION TAKEN ON IT

01:58:00.673 --> 01:58:03.075
SO I THINK WE CAN TELL THE STORY.

01:58:03.142 --> 01:58:04.343
AND I THINK YOU'LL BE QUITE

01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:06.579
IMPRESSED ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:08.648
IS WORKING IN THE SUCCESS THAT

01:58:08.714 --> 01:58:09.682
IT REALLY IS.

01:58:09.749 --> 01:58:11.150
BUT IT IS AN INVESTMENT AS YOU

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:13.085
SAID.

01:58:13.152 --> 01:58:15.254
RIGHT AND DECISIONS THAT GET

01:58:15.321 --> 01:58:17.123
MADE BASED ON SOME OF THE

01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:19.258
PREDICTIVE TOOLS ABOUT WHETHER

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:20.927
WIND PATTERNS HUMIDITY.

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:22.061
AND EVEN THOUGH SOMETHING DIDN'T

01:58:22.128 --> 01:58:23.496
START BUT THAT'S WHY WAS THAT

01:58:23.563 --> 01:58:24.664
DECISION MADE AND I THINK THAT

01:58:24.730 --> 01:58:26.866
REALLY HELPS US BUT YET THERE

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:28.401
THERE ARE GOOD EXAMPLES.

01:58:28.468 --> 01:58:29.669
ANY THAT WE SEEN OF ALL THE LAST

01:58:29.735 --> 01:58:31.571
NUMBER OF YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:32.872
I'VE SEEN AREAS WHERE THERE'S

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:35.475
BEEN A LARGE FIRE AND AIR ASSETS

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:37.143
THERE AND THEN A SMALL FIRE WILL

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:38.878
WILL START.

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:41.247
AND THEN BABY AND THEIR THEIR

01:58:41.314 --> 01:58:42.548
ASSET GETS.

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:44.817
RE DIRECTED SOLVES THAT SMALL

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.118
PROBLEM AND THEN BACK TO THE BIG

01:58:46.185 --> 01:58:47.587
PROBLEM.

01:58:47.653 --> 01:58:49.822
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HAVING

01:58:49.889 --> 01:58:51.591
EQUIPMENT NEARBY.

01:58:51.657 --> 01:58:53.893
AND USING IT EFFECTIVELY AND NOT

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:55.495
LETTING SOMETHING SMALL GET OUT

01:58:55.561 --> 01:58:56.796
OF HAND SO I THINK WE CAN FIND

01:58:56.863 --> 01:58:58.798
THOSE BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW WE

01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:00.399
NEED THE TO BUILD THE CASE.

01:59:00.466 --> 01:59:02.068
TALK ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND BE

01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:03.636
ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:04.637
OTHERWISE THAT MONEY SITTING

01:59:04.704 --> 01:59:06.005
THERE THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE

01:59:06.072 --> 01:59:07.440
PUT TO OTHER USE.

01:59:07.507 --> 01:59:09.442
MIGHT BE TOO TEMPTING. TO

01:59:09.509 --> 01:59:10.643
EVENTUALLY SWEEP AWAY AND I

01:59:10.710 --> 01:59:12.378
DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN SO

01:59:12.445 --> 01:59:14.113
I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE.

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.681
THIS EXACT CONVERSATION AND AND

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.216
LOOK TO SOME STORES LOOK TO SOME

01:59:17.283 --> 01:59:18.618
EXAMPLES OF HOW IT'S WORK I

01:59:18.684 --> 01:59:20.520
THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

01:59:20.586 --> 01:59:22.288
YES SIR OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU

01:59:22.355 --> 01:59:24.590
VERY MUCH I THINK AT I I I AGREE

01:59:24.657 --> 01:59:27.159
WITH OUR OUR MRS STONE CLEARLY

01:59:27.226 --> 01:59:28.928
THIS IS SOMETHING WITH WE'RE

01:59:28.995 --> 01:59:29.695
GOING TO HAVE TO DO AT SOME

01:59:29.762 --> 01:59:32.932
LEVEL -- BECAUSE I AT WE ARE.

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:35.101
COSTLY PLANNING FOR WHAT WE

01:59:35.167 --> 01:59:37.069
THINK IS THE NEW NORMAL NOW WE

01:59:37.136 --> 01:59:39.171
HOPE NOT BUT UP THE THE FIRES

01:59:39.238 --> 01:59:41.073
THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE OTHER

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:42.441
DISASTERS AND THE FLOODS IN THE

01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:43.876
YOU NAME IT ALL THOSE KINDS OF

01:59:43.943 --> 01:59:44.544
THINGS.

01:59:44.610 --> 01:59:46.679
ARE REALLY ISSUES THAT WE FACE

01:59:46.746 --> 01:59:48.347
NOW THAT WE DIDN'T THINK WE'D

01:59:48.414 --> 01:59:49.181
HAVE TO FACE BEFORE.

01:59:49.248 --> 01:59:50.316
WE'VE GOTTEN SMARTER IN SOME

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:51.984
AREAS YOU KNOW I COULDN'T

01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:55.688
REMEMBER THE SAN DIEGO FIRE

01:59:55.755 --> 01:59:55.888
WHERE.

01:59:55.955 --> 01:59:57.023
PEOPLE SPENT.

01:59:57.089 --> 01:59:57.790
DAYS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO

01:59:57.857 --> 01:59:59.225
WAS IN CHARGE OF A PLANE.

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:00.927
OF THE NOBODY KNEW WHO'S WHO

02:00:00.993 --> 02:00:02.828
COULD GET A PLANE TO TO

02:00:02.895 --> 02:00:04.297
BASICALLY PUT THE FIRE OUT WHICH

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:06.198
IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE.

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:07.633
AND SO FORTUNATELY AS A SAID NOW

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:08.901
I LOOK AND I SEE THE PLANES ARE

02:00:08.968 --> 02:00:10.202
MOVING BECAUSE THEY GOT IT AND

02:00:10.269 --> 02:00:11.370
UNDERSTANDING.

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:14.407
OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND

02:00:14.473 --> 02:00:15.341
AND AND THEY'RE NOT SITTING

02:00:15.408 --> 02:00:16.576
AROUND DEBATING WITH A NOT IT'S

02:00:16.642 --> 02:00:20.179
THE MILITARY OR ITS IS THIS OR

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:21.347
THAT AND IT WAS JUST THE MOST

02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:22.782
FRUSTRATING THING IT'S IN SAN

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:24.183
DIEGO WE HAD A FIRE AND I THINK

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:26.252
WAS. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OR

02:00:26.319 --> 02:00:28.721
WHATEVER IT WAS THAT OF THEY CAN

02:00:28.788 --> 02:00:29.322
FIGURE OUT WHO'S IN CHARGE OF

02:00:29.388 --> 02:00:31.257
PLANES THAT THAT THEY COULD GET

02:00:31.324 --> 02:00:32.758
THE WATER FOR TO FLY VER THE OF

02:00:32.825 --> 02:00:34.327
THE FIRES AND SO I I SEE THE

02:00:34.393 --> 02:00:35.728
COORDINATION.

02:00:35.795 --> 02:00:36.963
THE BETTER COORDINATION IT'S

02:00:37.029 --> 02:00:38.197
THERE AND I KNOW WE'VE DONE SOME

02:00:38.264 --> 02:00:39.532
COORDINATION WITH THINGS OF THE

02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:41.434
UNIVERSITY AND ALL THOSE KINDS

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:42.234
OF THINGS WITH OUR SAID

02:00:42.301 --> 02:00:44.236
UNDERSTANDING AND MAPPING AND

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:45.471
YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF STUFF.

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:46.606
SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE

02:00:46.672 --> 02:00:47.974
NEED TO DO WE JUST NEED TO TELL

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:50.076
BETTER STORY PROBABLY BE MORE.

02:00:50.142 --> 02:00:51.811
DETAIL ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS

02:00:51.877 --> 02:00:52.979
THAT WE DO BECAUSE IT IS

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:55.514
IMPORTANT -- THAT WE PREVENT --

02:00:55.581 --> 02:00:57.149
AS MUCH AS WELL AS RESPOND TO

02:00:57.216 --> 02:00:58.250
ISSUES THAT OF THE YEAR AND I

02:00:58.317 --> 02:01:01.153
THINK -- IF IF WE CAN.

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:01.921
TELL THAT STORY THE PUBLIC

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:03.289
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THESE

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:04.890
RESOURCES NEED TO BE IN A
