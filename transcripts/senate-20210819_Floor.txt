SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION SEVEN BY SENATOR BRADFORD RELATIVE TO DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR AND THE FBI SURVEILLANCE TAPES SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I STAND HERE TODAY. TO PRESENT. ALI WON THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS AND DECLARATIONS. DURING MY LEGISLATIVE CAREER AND I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT AS J. R. SEVEN. WHICH SIMPLY CALLS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF RECORDINGS AND TRANSCRIPTS OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR I WAS COLLECTED BY THE FBI ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL HIS DEATH. ADDITIONALLY THIS RESOLUTION URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT SIMILAR ABUSES OF POWER JUST FOR MORAL AND THE FLOOR MAJORITY REASONS THAT'S THE ONLY REASON FBI. WIRETAPPED DR MARTIN LUTHER KING TODAY DR KING IS BY ONE THE MOST REVERED LEADERS THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD HIS NAME IS SYNONYMOUS WITH EQUITY EQUALITY JUSTICE. PEACE HIS LIVE LONGER CONFIDENCE IN LEGACIES ARE CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY. EVERY YEAR ON HIS BIRTHDAY AND SOME PLACES AROUND THE WORLD. HOWEVER DR KING WHEN HE WAS ALIVE HE WAS VANDALIZED REALLY NICE I SHOULD SAY AND SLANDERED. BY MANY WHO OPPOSE HIS MISSION OF EQUALITY OF PEACE OF ENDING THE VIETNAM WAR AND THEN INCLUDED OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. DR KING WAS A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER YET J. EDGAR HOOVER THE DIRECTOR OF THE F. B. I.'S DECLARED DR KING THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN AMERICA. ALL CRAZY DIRECTOR HOOVER WAS AGGRESSIVELY HOSTILE TOWARD DR KING IN PARTICULAR ORDER IN HIS AGENTS TO ENGAGE AND CONVERT COVERT OPERATIONS AGAINST HIM. OPERATIONS LIKE COUNTER INTEL PAROLE WHICH WAS CREATED TO INVESTIGATE BLACK NATIONALIST HATE GROUPS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SCLC THE BLACK PANTHERS AND DOUBLE ACP AND OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS I GUESS IT FOR WAS A LOT OF THE DAY OF THE FOLLOWING BLACK LIVES MATTER AND MAN. AND SEVERAL ORGANISATIONS ARC YOU NAME IT HE REPRISE ALBUM WIRE TAPPING FOLLOW BEST BE I BEGAN MONITORING DR KING IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE DURING HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MONTGOMERY BOYS THE BUS BOYCOTT. SUPPOSEDLY BUT THEY WERE WRONG BECAUSE OF HIS CONNECTIONS WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY. AND THEY HELD HIM UNDER SURVEILLANCE FOR THE LAST THIRTEEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE. UNDER THE DRIVE P. I. DOMESTIC COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM DR KING HIS FAMILY HIS ASSOCIATES ALL WERE SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS CRIMES OF FBI SURVEILLANCE. THE FBI EVEN SENT A NOTE. URGING DR MARTIN LUTHER KING TO KILL HIMSELF TO AVOID THE HUMILIATION OF THESE TAPES BECOMING PUBLIC NOTICE AND RECORD. VIDEO RECORDINGS AND TRANSCRIPTS THIS CONTINUES TO HAPPEN TODAY TO MANY BLACK ACTIVISTS MOVEMENT OR FIGHTING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY A FAIRER AND BETTER PLACE FOR ALL. FBI LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL POLICE FORCES HOW DO YOU SEE SURVEILLANCE TACTICS TO TARGET BLACK PEOPLE AND OTHER GROUPS FIGHTING FOR RACIAL JUSTICE FOR DECADES THEY EVEN CONTINUE TODAY. ON HIS RESUME WE SAW IT LAST YEAR WITH THE GEORGE FLOYD MURDERS. FOR EXAMPLE BLACK ACTIVISTS IN SAN FRANCISCO IT TO SUIT CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF ALL LAWFUL SURVEILLANCE TACTICS. CRAPPIE ARE RECORDED THE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING ARE SCHEDULED TO GO PUBLIC. FROM OUR NATIONAL ARCHIVES IN TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. WHAT PURPOSE WHAT DOES THE IDEA TO DR KING AND OTHERS WAS UNLAWFUL IT WAS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY AND IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO SEARCH UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT OF OUR CONSTITUTION DR KING WAS AND IS A GREAT MAN. BUT HE WAS NOT INVIOLABLE HE WAS A HUMAN BEING LIKE THE REST OF US JUST THINK FOR A MOMENT OUR MOST PRIVATE MOMENTS WHEN OUR FAMILIES OUR FRIENDS OR COLLEAGUES. AND SOMEONE'S EAVESDROPPING AND WIRE TAPPING YOUR PHONE YOUR BEDROOM. THE HOTEL ROOM YOUR CAR. NONE OF US WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. ALTHOUGH HE WAS AMONG OUR GREATEST ORATORS IT WAS A DOLLY SPOKE. AT EASE WITH HIS FRIENDS IN COLLEGE LIKE MANY OF US DO ON A DAILY BASIS. THE RECORDS OF THESE PRIVATE MOMENTS WERE AN OBSCENE AND ILLEGAL INTRUSION INTO DR KING'S LIFE AND SHOULD NOT NEVER. BE MADE PUBLIC. AND NOT USE FOR STUFF LIKE A SCANDAL. THIS IS WHY THIS RESOLUTION NOT ONLY CALLS FOR THESE UNLAWFUL TAPES TO BE DESTROYED IT ALSO CALLS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT SIMILAR ABUSES. THIS RESOLUTION FOCUSES ATTENTION ON THE FAILURE OF OUR HISTORY THAT. MUST BE CORRECTED LEAST WE IGNORE IT PLUS WITH MORE NOR IT I SHOULD SAY AND CONTINUE TO PREFER PERPETRATE. THE SAME INJUSTICE AGAINST OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST. DR KING'S LEGACY DESERVES BETTER HIS FAMILY DESERVES BETTER BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS NATION DESERVES BETTER. WE CAN NO LONGER BE SILENT REGARDING THIS CRIMINAL ACT BY THE US GOVERNMENT. DR KING SAYS THE MOMENT WE REMAIN SILENT ON THE MATTER IS THAT MATTER MOST OUR LIVES BEGIN DAN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD MEMBERS WILL MOVE TO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. J. R. SEVEN AS THE AUTHOR HAS VERY ELOQUENTLY GIVEN THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I ALSO SUPPORTED AS WELL- JUST KIND OF LANDING ON THE THOUGHT THAT THE U. S. CONSTITUTION GIVES ALL OF US US CITIZENS PROTECTION. FROM OUR GOVERNMENT ILLEGALLY AND INAPPROPRIATELY SURVEILLING US- WITHOUT WARRANT OR WITHOUT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE FBI ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY. IN THESE SITUATIONS AND- I SUPPORT IS J. R. SEVEN AND ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS BECOME. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES CENTER CALL LOGGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF. S. J. R. SEVEN- YOU KNOW THESE TAPES SHOULD BE DESTROYED THEY SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED- THEY CERTAINLY DOCUMENT THE SURVEILLANCE AND HARASSMENT OF DR KING- AND THE IDEA BEHIND RELEASING THEM IS REALLY TO SULLY THE NAME AND LEGACY OF AN AMERICAN ICON. IF YOU WERE GOING TO LOOK DEEPLY INTO THE PAST I THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO LOOK DEEPER. INTO THE CHARACTER OF J. EDGAR HOOVER WHO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS ABOVE THE LAW. AND IN FACT- THIS PART OF OUR HISTORY AS A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR SO MANY. ABOUT PRIVACY POWER AND AFFIX. WE WOULD DO OURSELVES A DISSERVICE TO GO BACK AND EXAMINE THE PAST THAT WE CANNOT CHANGE. WHY IS SOMEONE'S PERSONAL LIFE OR THEIR FRAILTIES OF ANY IMPORTANCE WHAT DOES THIS ADD TO THE DISCUSSIONS WE'RE HAVING ABOUT OUR FUTURE THE RELEASE OF THESE TAPES IS NOT ABOUT ART IT'S NOT ABOUT CONTEXTUAL AS ASIAN. IT IS REALLY JUST SALACIOUS AND PERNICIOUS AND AN ATTEMPT TO DENIGRATE SOMEONE WHO HAS DIED. REALLY SO MANY OF US COULD CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS. AND THERE WOULD BE NO GREATER HARM THAN TO RELEASE THESE TAPES I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT AND VOTE I'D FOR AS J. R. SEVEN. THANK YOU SENATOR CAMARGO CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RAISE AND SUPPORT OF ESTATE J. R. SEVEN AND I THINK THE- MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA FOR- HIS ELOQUENT REMARKS ABOUT- THE HISTORICAL OF. LEGACY IN THE HISTORICAL PRESENCE OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. I ALSO THINK IT'S APPALLING THAT THE FBI IN ANY SITUATION WOULD BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO AN AMERICAN- ANY AMERICANS PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ANY PROPER PROCESS. AND I THINK THE PROPER PROCESS HAS BEEN DAMAGED SO MUCH IN THE PAST THAT- IT WOULD BE HARD TO. SAY THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY DO IT- TO ME IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE BLACK WHITE IN JABI LATINO ASIAN. OR ANY OTHER RACE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE SPYING ON OR LISTENING TO CONVERSATIONS- THAT TAKE PLACE IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE. AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER IT'S APPALLING THAT THE FBI WOULD HAVE DONE SO TO MARTIN LUTHER KING. A JUNIOR I DO- I DO THINK THAT AND THE FOURTH AMENDMENT I DO KNOW THAT THE FOURTH MEMO WAS PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT US AND EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN FROM. SITUATIONS LIKE THIS AND- I WOULD HOPE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHO THAT UNITED STATES CITIZEN IS- THAT IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO ANYONE. IN THIS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ANYWAY SO I SUPPORT THIS YEAR SEVEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND I WOULD HOPE THAT AND- THIS WOULD SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THINGS LIKE THIS SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED. IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AGAINST HER CITIZENS THANK YOU SIR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I ASK FOR AN IPHONE. KEY CENTER GROVE. PLEASE ENTER IN THE SENATE IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ANY DECENT DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. LAST CALL. CENTRE BRADFORD WE LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES WHO STOOD UP AND WENT TO A VOICE TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE AS STATED THERE IS NO EDUCATIONAL OR CULTURAL BENEFIT OF THESE TAPES THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THESE TAPES FROM THE RECORDED DATA AND FOR THEIR FUTURE POSSIBLE RELEASES ONLY TO SULLY THE REPUTATION OF A MAN WHO GAVE HIS LIFE. LET ME SAY THIS AGAIN WHO GAVE HIS LIFE FOR THIS NATION AND IN MANY WAYS FOR THIS WRLD FOR ALL OF US TO LIVE AND- HM OUR WORLD IS FAR FROM PERFECT BUT MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT HE FOUND IT AND- THE RELEASE. THE WORST CRIMINAL ACTS YOU CAN DO TO A FAMILY TO A MAN- TO THIS COUNTRY WE SHOW HOW PETTY WE REALLY ARE AS A COUNTRY IF WE DO THAT SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I RISE TO ASK THAT SHE SENT A JOURNEY IN MEMORY OF AMBASSADOR JAMES HORMEL. WHO IS ONE OF OUR GREAT PHILANTHROPISTS DIPLOMATS AND OUR NATION'S FIRST OPENLY LGBT Q. AMBASSADOR HI JIM PASSED AWAY ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH. AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS OLD HE WAS TRULY ONE OF OUR% GREAT MODERN LGBTQ COMMUNITY LEADERS IN THIS NATION BORN IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND AUSTIN MINNESOTA- THE GRANDSON OF- FORMEL FOODS FOUNDER GEORGE A. HORMEL HI JIM IT'S ATTENDED SWARTHMORE COLLEGE WHERE HE EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN HISTORY. HE WENT THERE AFTER A LAW DEGREE FROM UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO SCHOOL OF LAW AND SERVED AS A TEEN- CHICAGO LAW SCHOOL- IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND NINETY SEVEN- JIM SERVED IN THE WESTERN STATES REGIONAL SELECTION PANEL FOR THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON WHITE HOUSE FELLOWSHIPS. I ALSO ACTED AS AN ALTERNATE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE U. S. DELEGATION TO THE FIFTY FIRST UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND HE SERVED AS THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO LUXEMBOURG- IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND. HI JIM IS ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S AND LGBTQ COMMUNITY'S FOREMOST LEADERS AND PHILANTHROPISTS- I'M HAVING FUN SO MANY CRITICAL COMMUNITY LEADS THE NEEDS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE- THE JAMES HORMEL LGBTQ I A CENTER- AT THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC LIBRARY- THE AIDS MEMORIAL GROVE IN GOLDEN GATE PARK IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN AND SO MANY OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HE WAS A CO FOUNDER OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN FORTY YEARS AGO WHICH IS THE LARGEST LGBTQ CIVIL. RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY. I JIM WAS ALSO- A HUGE PROPONENT OF THE ART- WITH THE FINANCIAL SUPPORTER OF THE AMERICAN CONSERVATORY THEATER. ABOVE ALL ELSE HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND FATHER MY GRANDFATHER AND GREAT GRANDFATHER WHO DEDICATED HIS LIFE IN SERVICE TO OTHERS. NORMALLY IN THESE INSURANCE THE MEMORIES WE WANT TO FOCUS ONLY ON THE POSITIVE BUT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT HAPPENING IN THE LATE NINETIES AROUND JIM'S LIFE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. AND I THINK JIM WOULD WANT US TO REMEMBER AND THAT IS WHEN PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON NOMINATED JAM TO BE AMBASSADOR TO LUXEMBOURG. THERE WERE NO QUESTIONS WHATSOEVER ABOUT JIM'S EXTREME QUALIFICATIONS TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY- IN LUXEMBOURG- BUT UNFORTUNATELY HIS NOMINATION HIS CONFIRMATION- WAS DERAILED IN THE SENATE- BY RIGHT WING SENATORS. OUT OF PURE UNADULTERATED ON MASS FROM A PHOBIA AND THIS IS IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES AND IT'S A REMINDER- THAT IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO- THIS WAS CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE. ACTIVITY AND DISCOURSE- AT LEAST IN ONE OF THE MAJOR NATIONAL PARTIES. BY THE SENATE DID NOT CONFIRM HIM AND WE HEARD STATEMENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES SENATORS- IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES OPPOSING HIM FOR. SUPPORTING THE QUOTE UNQUOTE GAY AGENDA- ONE SENATOR SAID. QUOTE THIS IS NOT A TOLERANCE ISSUE THIS IS A MATTER OF ADVOCACY OF THE GAY LIFESTYLE. THE MAJORITY LEADER SENATOR TRENT LOTT- WENT ON TV AND SAID QUOTE. YOU SHOULD TRY TO SHOW THEM REFERRING TO LGBT PEOPLE A WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM JUST LIKE ALCOHOL OR SEX ADDITION OR CLICK THE MANIACS- HE ALSO. ISSUED A STATEMENT QUOTE SENATOR LOTT OPPOSES THE NAMING OF SOMEONE. WHO HAS SUPPORTED AN EXTREMIST ANTI CATHOLIC GROUP TO REPRESENT THE U. S. REFERRING TO THE SISTERS OF PERPETUAL. INDULGENCE ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH RAISES ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO SUPPORT OUR MOST MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES- THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL AND TRADITIONAL VALUES COALITION. OPPOSE THE NOMINATION. BASED ON. GEMS DONATION OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC LIBRARY TO CREATE AN LGBTQ. ARCHIVE ON ON ON THIS HORRIFIC STATEMENTS OPPOSING HIS NOMINATION FORTUNATELY- HE WAS- PRESIDENT CLINTON PERSISTED I WAS ABLE TO NAME HIM AS A RECESS APPOINTMENT AND HE SERVED HONORABLY FOR TWO YEARS AND THEN SPENT THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS CONTINUING. HIS INCREDIBLE SERVICE ATTIRE OUR COMMUNITY. I'M JIM PASSED AWAY IN SAN FRANCISCO AS I MENTIONED AUGUST THIRTEENTH OF NATURAL CAUSES. HE'S SURVIVED BY HIS HUSBAND MICHAEL- BY HIS CHILDREN ALLISON ANALISA BIT JIMMY AND SARAH- BY HIS FOURTEEN GRANDCHILDREN AND BY HIS SEVEN GREAT GRANDCHILDREN- I WILL ALSO- TO SAY THAT I I'VE KNOWN JOHN YOU JIM PERSONALLY- THIS SINCE I MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO IN THE IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES. HE WAS TRULY ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL HUMAN BEINGS THAT I'VE KNOWN TO START A PLEASANT UP BE LOVELY PERSON WHO JUST CARE DEEPLY ABOUT SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY AND NEVER ASKED FOR ANYTHING- IN RETURN JUST WANTED TO BE THERE FOR HIS COMMUNITY AND FOR OUR GREAT CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. YOUR COLLEAGUES I ASKED AT THE SENATE ADJOURNED. IN MEMORY OF AMBASSADOR JAMES HORMEL THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR WIENER ON NATURE IN THE MEMORY OF THE AMBASSADOR THE SENATE WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE CENTER EARLIER GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT. OF SENATOR WINNER DID A GREAT JOB OF OUTLINING OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF JIM HORMEL AND WHO HE WAS AND IS SCOTT PHILANTHROPIC AND CIVIC CONTRIBUTIONS. N. AS SOMEBODY THAT KNEW HIM IN THAT PERIOD. R. HE DID HAVE THOSE CHARACTERISTICS OF HE WAS QUIET WARMTH DIGNITY. A AND I THINK INTERESTINGLY THOSE WERE PROBABLY THE PERFECT CHARACTERISTICS FOR SOMEBODY. THAT WAS A TRAILBLAZER. I AS SOMEBODY THAT KNEW HOW. IT WAS HARD. TO WATCH WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE THE SPECIFIC PART OF IT WAS. IS HE WAS APPOINTED. AND IT COULD NOT GET THROUGH THE SENATE AND PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD TO DO A RECESS APPOINTMENT. TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND THE INTERESTING THING WAS IS THERE WAS A DEBATE. WHICH SEEMS. SO PREHISTORIC NOW. ABOUT WHETHER HIS SPOUSE COULD COME WITH HIM TO THE COUNTRY OR COULD APPEAR AT OFFICIAL EVENTS FOR QUICK EVEN LIVE OR BE SEEN IN THE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE THAT HAPPENED JUST ROUGHLY A QUARTER CENTURY AGO. AND YET. IT WAS HIS PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT FOR THE RESPONSE WHERE WHICH IS THE REASON THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY PERFECT FOR SOMEBODY TO BE SUCH A TRAILBLAZER. SO I THINK HE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AND TO THE COMMUNITY TO HIS FRIENDS TO FAMILY- IT IS A BIG LOSS SO- ARE JOINED. IN THE GERMAN MEMORY TO SOMEBODY THAT WAS A GREAT STATE. THINNER LAYER JOINING WITH SENATOR WIENER ON BEHALF OF THE JOURNEY MEMORY OF AMBASSADOR JAMES HORMEL THANK YOU GENTLEMEN. WE HAVE ONE FINAL JOURNEY MEMORY TODAY WE LIKE TO START WITH SINNERS RISE SO- IN MEMORY OF MR TRUMKA WILL THEN HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM SACKINGS. INDIAN FROM MISTER CORTESE. CENTER DRIVE SO THE FLOOR IS YOURS GREAT. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THIS MORNING I REQUEST THAT WE ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF RICHARD TRUMKA THE LONGTIME LEADER AND PRESIDENT OF THE AFL-CIO. THAT'S THE WAY UNEXPECTEDLY ON AUGUST FIFTH. AFL-CIO IS MADE UP OF FIFTY SIX NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL UNIONS REPRESENTING TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION WORKING MEN AND WOMEN. RICHARD TRUMKA WAS A THIRD GENERATION COAL MINER FROM IMMIGRANT ITALIAN AND POLISH STOCK. GROWING UP IN THE LITTLE APPALACHIAN COAL TOWN OF MAMMOTH COLIN IN SOUTHWEST PENNSYLVANIA. HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF HIS UNION THE UNITED MINE WORKERS OF AMERICA ARGUABLY THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT UNION IN AMERICAN LABOR HISTORY. THAT UNION WAS THE DRIVING FORCE IN THE CREATION OF THE MASSIVE INDUSTRIAL LABOR ORGANIZING CAMPAIGNS OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE FOR THE TRUMP GOT LEAD. AN EPIC TEN MONTHS STRIKE OF TWO THOUSAND UNION MINERS AGAINST THE PITTSTON COAL COMPANY. I HAD JUST BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF MY LOCAL UNION AND THE PITTSTON STRIKE WAS A NATIONAL INSPIRATION FOR US IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN SUPPORT OF WORKERS ON STRIKE ON A NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN. I AM ESPECIALLY PROUD BECAUSE OUR UNION EIGHT CHERRY ST FIVE COOKS TO CAMP SOLIDARITY TO PREPARE THREE MEALS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK UNTIL THE STRIKERS ONE. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE FOR THE TRUMP KERR JOINED JOHN SWEENEY AND LINDA CHAVEZ THOMPSON IN THE FIRST CONTESTED ELECTION IN THE AFL CIO'S. HISTORY AS A FEDERATION THE ONE. ELECTED THE FIRST WOMAN AND PERSON OF COLOR AS A NATIONAL OFFICER ON HIS SLATE. WHICH TRUMP KERR WAS COMMITTED TO ORGANIZE A NEW LABOR MOVEMENT. AS A SIGNAL TO HIS THAT COMMITMENT HE DECIDED TO HOLD THE NEXT AFL-CIO CONVENTION IN LOS ANGELES IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE CONVENTION BROTHER TRUMKA I HAD THE PRIVILEGE. OF MARCHING WITH BROTHER BROTHER TRUMKA AS HE LED THOUSANDS OF CONVENTION DELEGATES TO THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. IN THE FIRST EVER NATIONAL LABOR MOVEMENT MARCH IN SUPPORT OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS. THIS IS THAT THE NEW YORK COUNTY HOTEL WHICH WE WERE ORGANIZING HUNDREDS OF WORKERS OF EVENTUALLY WON UNIONIZATION. AT THIS CONVENTION THERE FOR L. C. I. U. BROKE WITH ITS PAST. AND APPROVE THE HISTORIC STANDUP FOR IMMIGRANT WORKERS RESOLUTION ACKNOWLEDGING THE ROLE OF UNIONS TO DEFEND UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE SAME LABOR MOVEMENT. I AM PRIVILEGED TO HAVE CHAIRED THE NATIONAL F. L. C. I. U. IMMIGRATION COMMITTEE AND TO HAVE SERVED ON THE AFL-CIO EXECUTIVE COUNCIL. THE HIGHEST BODY IN THE INFO ABOUT SEO UNDER BROTHER TRUMP IS LEADERSHIP HE WAS BOLD AND HE WAS UNWAVERING IN HIS COMMITMENT TO ALL WORKING FAMILIES. THE PRO WORKER PRO IMMIGRANT DOCTRINE OF HIS CATHOLIC FAITH INFORMED HIS SENSE OF SOLIDARITY. HE SAW AND FELT THE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND THE IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS MOVEMENT HE SAW AND FELT THE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN MINERS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MINERS IN SOUTH AFRICA FIGHTING TO DISMANTLE APARTHEID. HE SAW THE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN WHITE STEEL WORKERS IN OHIO AN AFRICAN AMERICAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE U. S. HE SAW THE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN. SOUTH ASIAN TAXI DRIVERS AND LET THE IN THE DOMESTIC WORKERS. ALONGSIDE PAINTERS UNLIKE TRADITIONS. HE SAW THE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN THE SIX YEAR STRIKE OF LAS VEGAS FRONTIER CASINO WORKERS AND THE PITS AND STRIKERS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE. ON THE OCCASION OF THE TWENTY THIRTEEN AFL-CIO CONVENTION IN LOS ANGELES HE AGREED TO DO THE TRADITIONAL EVENING AT A BASEBALL GAME. HE WAS A HARDCORE PIRATES FAN BUT HE SWALLOWED HIS DISLIKE FOR THE DODGERS AND THREW OUT THE FIRST PITCH I GOT TO CATCH IT. HE WAS A DEVOTED HUSBAND FATHER AND GRANDFATHER HE LEFT LEFT US FAR TOO SOON. OUR LABOR MOVEMENT AND MILLIONS OF WORKERS HERE AND ALL OVER THE WORLD MOURN HIS DEATH. THOSE SAME WORKERS WILL RECOMMIT TO THE IDEALS OF JUSTICE THE BROTHER RICH TRUMKA DEDICATED HIS LIFE. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK WITH GERMAN IN HIS NAME. SENATOR AWESOME THANK YOU THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL WE'RE NOT GONNA RECOGNIZE PRESIDENT PRO TEM MACHEN'S ON THE JOURNEY MEMORY OF RICHARD TRUMKA MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND- I AM CLEARLY NOT GOING TO HAVE THE ARTICULATE COMMENTS FROM MY THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOSANGELES JUST MADE. BUT I REALLY HAD TO GET UP AND SAY A FEW THINGS FROM A VERY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW- I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HEAR THE WORD PITTSTON COAL COMPANY OR COAL MINERS ACTUALLY ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND I'M REALLY SORRY THAT WE'RE HEARING IT TODAY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PASSING OF- A VERY DECENT MAN. A VERY- INCREDIBLE ADVOCATE FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND TO THE COMMENTS- THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES MADE. YOU KNOW- I GREW UP MY DAD WAS A LEAD MINER COAL MINER. AND SO I'M USED TO PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTANDING THE FIGHT OF SOME OF THOSE WORKERS. AND DISMISSING WHOLE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF WORK THEY DO THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST. A FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT BUT- SHE CALLED SHE SHE MY COLLEAGUE SAID HE WAS HARD CORE HE ABSOLUTELY WAS HARD CORE- IN THE WAYS THAT HE PRESENTED HIS MESSAGE. WHEN I FINALLY MET- RICHARD TRUMKA FOR ME IT WAS LIKE MEETING CELEBRITIES ONLY SECOND TO MY FAVORITE PERSON OF ALL TIME DOLLY PARTON. SO THAT INSPIRES AND TELLS YOU HOW IMPORTANT- THE WORK THAT HE DID WAS FOR ME AND MY FAMILY- PARTICULARLY- YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE COAL MINES WHEN I WENT TO GET A DEGREE FOUND A WAY TO DO THAT AND THEN WENT ON TO LAW SCHOOL. AND FIGURED OUT HOW TO BRING TOGETHER THE INTERSECTION MALADY WE LIKE THAT WORD TODAY THE INTERSECTION ALITY OF VALUES AND HOW YOU EQUATE THAT WITH THE ECONOMY AND HOW IT IMPACTS COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE. AND YET TAKE IT FORWARD IN A WAY THAT TALKS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND CLIMATE ISSUES AND HOW IT IMPACTS THE VERY COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING JOBS THAT WORK AGAINST THAT VERY. OUR GOAL OF A BETTER ENVIRONMENT AND YET HAVING NOT MANY OPTIONS. MY FAVORITE TIME WAS TO SEE HIM ON THE STAGE IN SAN FRANCISCO AS PART OF OUR FORMER FORMER GOVERNOR. BROWN'S CLIMATE CONFERENCE WHERE HE MADE THE MOST PASSIONATE SPEECH ABOUT NOT LEAVING COMMUNITIES BEHIND AS WE SET THOSE GOALS AND TO ME THAT WAS HIM SPEAKING TO MY- APPALACHIAN HERITAGE AND PEOPLE IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND WEST VIRGINIA. AND PENNSYLVANIA AND ARIZONA AND PLACES WHERE MINING IS A JOB THAT BRINGS MONEY TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILIES. AND SO WHEN I MET HIM. I REALLY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THEN LATER AS YOU WERE- RESPECTIVELY- PRO TEM. BUT ALL I COULD SEE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS WHO HAD MANAGED. TO TAKE THAT FIGHT TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL REPRESENTING TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION WORKERS AND THEN HOLDING THOSE WORKERS ACCOUNTABLE TO CHANGING TIMES AND BELIEVES. HE FOUGHT PREJUDICE WITHIN THE RANKS AND HELD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE TO BRING THEM ALONG. AS HE HAD COME ALONG FROM GENERATIONS OF HARD WORKING PEOPLE. IN ALL THOSE PROFESSIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO MISS HIM. BECAUSE HE ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS IMPORTANT AS ANYBODY REGARDLESS OF TITLE AND WHEN I CAME IN AND HE COULDN'T WAIT TO GIVE ME THE LATEST BOOK THAT HE WAS A DIVING INTO TO DISCUSS THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES I GAVE HIM MY FAVORITE BOOK. A COPY OF THE BOOK DEER HUNTING WITH JESUS AS A MEANS TO TALK ABOUT POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND HOW IT APPLIES TO BLUE COLLAR WORKING CLASS PEOPLE SO I ALWAYS LIKED THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO AN EXCHANGE. I RISE AND SADNESS TODAY JUST AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET SOMEONE WHO MEANT SO MUCH TO MY FAMILY AND MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THOSE LIVES IN WAGES AND HEALTH CARE AND RECOGNITION FOR THE DIGNITY OF THE WORK. THAT THEY EACH DID AND SO ON THANK YOU. TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR DOING SUCH AN ELOQUENT JOB OF HIS PROFESSIONAL HISTORY AND ALSO GIVEN A GLIMPSE OF WHO THIS MAN WAS A DECENT DECENT AMERICAN FIGHTING FOR WORKERS IN AMERICA. I JOIN YOU IN ADJOURNING IN MEMORY OF HIM TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM SUCH AN INCREDIBLY. PERSONAL STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF RICHARD TRUMKA IN HIS MEMORY THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT PRO TEM. FACING GERMAN THE SENATE. WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION CENTER CORTESE. JOURNEY MEMORY ON BEHALF OF MR TRUMKA MISTER CORTESE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I TO RISE- TO JOURNEY MEMORY IN HONOR OF THE LATE RICHARD TRUMKA. THANK YOU- MADAM PRO TIM- FOR YOUR ELOQUENCE IN THE PERSONAL TOUCH. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR THE GREAT TRIBUTE. ON THE PROFESSIONAL LEGACY OF RICHARD TRUMKA I JUST WANTED TO ADD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MAN FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET HIM OR TO ENGAGE HIM IN TERMS OF. THE STYLE OF LEADERSHIP- THAT HE REPRESENTED AND HOW HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF. IN IT WAS ON A VERY PERSONAL BASIS AND IT WAS ON A VERY INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND HE DID MAKE A POINT. BUT WHEN HE WAS IN OUR REGION- TO LET LABOR LEADERS KNOW THAT HE WANTED TO SPEAK ONE ON ONE- WITH LEADERS IN FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY- WHO CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THEN HE DID THAT. IN AS QUICK AS HE WAS IN HIS POWERFUL SPEAKER AS HE WAS- IN WE ALL HEARD RECENTLY A SPEECH THAT WAS SHARED. WITHIN OUR CAUCUS- THAT HE MADE ON RACISM. WHERE HE TOUCHED UPON- AND EXPLAINED RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. AGAIN WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH BY USING AN ANECDOTE ABOUT WHAT HIS NEIGHBOR SAID WHAT HIS NEIGHBORS SAID WHAT A LOCAL PERSON SAID. TO HIM. THAT HELPED EXPLAINED TO ALL OF US. HOW RACISM WAS OCCURRING IN THIS COUNTRY WITH THE ELECTION OF A PRESIDENT UNITED STATES AT THE TIME. HE PUT ON A ONE ON ONE BASIS HE WAS A SOFT SPOKEN PERSON. HE WAS VERY APPROACHABLE PERSON- HE WAS A PERSON WHO. GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WANTED TO BEFRIEND YOU. YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHY. THERE WAS SUCH AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO HIS DEATH AMONG SO MANY OF US. SOMETIMES WHEN A GREAT LEADER. PASSES AWAY. WILL WE ALL FIRST LEARNED ABOUT IT. THROUGH NEWS THROUGH HEADLINES THROUGH NEWS WIRES SO MANY OF US HEARD ABOUT THE DEATH RICHARD TRUMKA. BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE. WHO SHARED MOMENTS WITH HIM WHO DID LOCAL WORK WITH HIM. LET US KNOW. THROUGH A TEXT. INTO THE KIND OF COMMUNICATION THAT YOU MORE OFTEN SEE. WHEN SOMEBODY LOSES A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY- WHEN SOMEBODY LOSES SOMEBODY WHO WE ALL KNOW. ON A FIRST NAME BASIS. THERE IS. THE LEADER THE AFL CIO WAS LOST TODAY WERE DIED TODAY OR PASSED AWAY WITH THE MESSAGE THAT WAS CIRCULATED. REALLY IN A VIRAL MANNER ONE PERSON AT A TIME WHEN WE LOST RICHARD TRUMKA WAS THAT WE LOST RICHARD TODAY. YEAH AND- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SOMEBODY WHO HAD. THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH HIM A LITTLE BIT. BUT IN MY OWN COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY- TO SHARE AGAIN THE STYLE OF LEADERSHIP. IN THE PERSONAL EMPATHY AND INTEREST THAT HE HAD AND ALL OF US. AS HE DID HIS JOB. IT'S A TREMENDOUS LOSS THE WOMEN'S HONORS LEGACY THROUGH ACTION IN THE FIGHT TO STAND. BUT AGAIN. WITH THE REQUEST TO ADJOURN AT HIS MEMORY TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE HERE WE HAVE ONE ITEM THAT IS ON CALL THAT'S FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR- IN AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE UP ONE ADDITIONAL ITEM DUE TO SOON TIMELINE ISSUES IN THE OTHER HOUSE THAT GIVE US. A MOMENT AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU. ALL RIGHT. IMMERSE WE'RE GONNA LIVE THE CALL AND FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR.

WE'RE GONNA HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON FOR JUST A FEW MOMENTS WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. ALL RIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE UP ONE LAST ITEM. THAT IS UNDER A SIMPLY THIRD READING THIS IS FILE ITEM ONE FIFTY THREE DAYS IN GENERAL THE SENATE WE'RE LOOKING AT FILE AT A ONE FIFTY THREE SENATOR STERN IS PREPARED TO PRESENT TO MY RIGHT. BETTER SECTOR CAN YOU PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOSE THREE OF US AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS. CENTER STORE GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS- CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF FORTY FIVE STATES THE LAW ALLOWS THE GOVERNOR TO APPOINT A PERSON TO FILL A VACANCY IN THE U. S. SENATE. WHAT IF THEY CAN SEE A CURSE AND A SIX YEAR SENATE TERM THAT APPOINTEE SERVES UNTIL THE ELECTION IS HELD TO SELECT THE PERSON WHO SERVES THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM. EARLY THIS YEAR. THEN SENATOR KAMEL HARRIS. NOW OR VICE PRESIDENT. RESIGNED HER U. S. SENATE SEAT. ADVANCE OF INAUGURATION. AND THAT RESIGNATION CREATED A VACANCY. THAT WAS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS TRIGGERED AND TRIGGERED A RE EXAMINATION OF CALIFORNIA'S LAWS. FOR FILLING SUCH VACANCIES. SINCE THE LAST VACANCY OCCURRED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE TO APPELLATE COURTS ISSUED DECISIONS THAT RAISE QUESTIONS. ABOUT WHETHER CALIFORNIA'S U. S. SENATE VACANCY PROCEDURES. ARE CONSISTENT. WITH THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. IN PARTICULAR IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER STATE LAW. LEE ALLOWS AN APPOINTEE TO HOLD OFFICE FOR THE REMAINDER OF A SENATE TERM AND WITH THAT COMPLIES WITH THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT SO WE BE FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE IS. A CRITICAL MEASURE- TO MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA LAW IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT FOR BY PROVIDING FOR AN ELECTION TO BE HELD TO FILL A VACANCY IN CALIFORNIA'S REPRESENTATION IN THE U. S. SENATE. EVEN IF THE VACANCY OCCURS DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS THE SENATE TERM. SO IN ORDER TO AVOID COSTLY DISRUPTIONS OF STANDALONE STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTIONS AT FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE REQUIRES U. S. SENATE VACANCY ELECTIONS TO BE CONSOLIDATED WITH REGULARLY SCHEDULED. STATEWIDE ELECTIONS. THE TIMING OF THE VACANCY DOES NOT ALLOW THAT VACANCY TO BE CONSOLIDATED WITH THE LAST THE STATEWIDE PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION HELD DURING THAT TERM. THE BILL ESTABLISHES A PROCEDURE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO SCHEDULE A SPECIAL PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM IF IT'S PRACTICAL TO DO SO- BUT LA COUNTY MEANWHILE IS CURRENTLY PILOTING A PROJECT USING AN ALTERNATE BALLOT ORDER. WE'RE LOCAL OFFICES APPEAR ON THE BALLOT BEFORE STATE FEDERAL OFFICES. SO IT'S UNCLEAR THIS WOULD IMPACT PARTICIPATION WHEN SPECIAL VACANCY ELECTION OR REELECTION. WOULD APPEAR ON THE SAME BALLOT. SO THE BILL ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BY ENSURING THAT S. BUT WHEN A SPEECH SPECIAL VACANCY ELECTION IN A REGULAR ELECTION. FOR THE SAME LEGISLATIVE OR CONGRESSIONAL SEAT APPEAR ON THE SAME BALLOT. VOTERS WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THIS BY PLACING THE TWO ELECTIONS AT THE FRONT OF THE BALLOT. WITH CLEARLY MARKED HEADERS. THANKS FOR FOLLOWING ALONG WITH US TO HELP YOU- I HOPE WE GET THIS RECTIFICATION SOLVED AND BRING SOME ORDER TO OUR PROCESS BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL LINEMEN AND RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.
