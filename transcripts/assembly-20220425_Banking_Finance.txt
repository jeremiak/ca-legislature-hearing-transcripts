F. P. EYES YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY REPORT ON THIS PILOT PROGRAM THEY NOTED THAT IN TWENTY TEN THE AFFORDABLE CREDIT BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES PILOT PROGRAM WAS IN EFFECT HELLO LENDER PARTICIPATION RATE LED TO THE PROGRAM'S DEMISE LEADING TO A TO BE REPLACED BY THIS PILOT PROGRAM IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF THAT AGAIN WE'VE GOT ONE MAJOR LENDER LEFT AND SO HOW DO YOU GET MORE LENDERS INTO THIS PROGRAM SO THAT MORE CALIFORNIANS KNOW ABOUT IT THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PROGRAM AND CAN ACCESS THESE FUNDS WHEN THEY NEED IT INSTEAD OF GOING TO AT A A. N. LENDING ENERGY OFFSHORE NOT REGULATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE DOESN'T TOUCH THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS OF THE UNDERLYING PROGRAM IT DOESN'T TOUCH THE SUNSET DATE OF THE PROGRAM IT HAS TWO MAIN COMPONENTS TO IT AND THE FIRST IS REQUIRING D. F. P. I. TO POST ON THE INTERNET THE LIST OF OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION PROVIDERS THAT A LENDER COULD UTILIZE WHICH HERE IN A SECOND MISTER GWALTNEY IS GOING TO GET INTO WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IN HELPING KEEPING COSTS TO THE LENDER DOWN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM SECONDLY IT ALLOWS THE INTRODUCTION NOT A MANDATE BUT ALLOWS THE CHARGE OF A MONTHLY MAINTENANCE FEE FOR THE SERVICING OF THAT LOAN IN HERE IN A SECOND MISTER BALL HE'S GOING TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT TO RIGHT NOW THE BILL SAYS FORTY DOLLARS PER MONTH POTENTIAL MONTHLY MAINTENANCE FEE ON THE LOAN HOW DID WE GET THERE AS WE STARTED LOOKING AT THIS PROGRAM WE STARTED LOOKING AT WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE HERE IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ON LOANS IN THIS SPACE AGAIN THE THIS BILL DOESN'T TOUCH PAYDAY AND IT DOESN'T TOUCH THOSE LOANS COVERED BY AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SMALL SPACE BETWEEN THE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR SPACE AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT OTHER STATES OHIO VIRGINIA HAWAII WE SAID OKAY ONE OF THOSE STATES ALLOW IN THIS PROGRAM WHAT IT THEIR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE THERE LATE FEES ARE THERE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE STATES ALLOWED A MONTHLY MAINTENANCE FEE ON THE LOANS IN THE SPACE VARYING DEGREES IS FORTY DOLLARS THE RIGHT NUMBER DON'T KNOW MIGHT BE MIGHT NOT BE OTHER STATES TOOK TIERED APPROACHES DEPENDING ON THE LOAN AMOUNT WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO TALKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND SO -- WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND TURN IT OVER TO MR CALLED ME TO GET INTO SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ECONOMICS OF THE LOS THANK YOU MISTER MOFFETT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN GRAYSON I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE I'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR AS WELL MY NAME IS DAN GWALTNEY ON VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND I WANTED TO OFFER A PERSPECTIVE FROM LICENSED CALIFORNIA LENDERS AND WHAT IT TAKES IN ORDER TO OFFER LOANS TO THE CONSUMERS AND AS WE LOOK AT THE PILOT OVER THE YEARS AND UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THE PILOT -- WELL INTENTIONED BEEN OUT THERE FOR ALMOST A YOU KNOW MORE THAN A DECADE BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT ATTRACTING ENOUGH SUPPORT FROM DEAL LICENSE LENDING COMMUNITY AS WE KNOW CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING FOR LOANS CALIFORNIA LICENSED REGULATED LENDERS WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERS OPERATE BOTH IN THE ONLINE BUT ALSO HAVE A LARGE NETWORK OVER THOUSAND LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY AS WE SAW THE PILOT IS MISTER MOFFETT POINTED OUT THE PILOT PROGRAM ONLY REALLY HAS ONE PRIMARY LENDER THE SECOND LENDER WHO HAPPENED TO BE KIND OF THE GRANDFATHER THE PILOT PROGRAM THE FOUNDING FATHER THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT PARTICULAR COMPANY WHEN IT LEFT THE SPACE DUE TO A BANKRUPTCY LEFT THE STATE SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO LOCATIONS SHOT THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY HAD PARTNERED UP THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED FINDING SO MEMBERS THAT ARE NOW OUR MEMBERS THAT ARE LOOKING TO GET INTO THE SPACE AND OFFER CUSTOMERS BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS STALLMAN LOANS UP NEED TO BE ABLE TO COVER THEIR COSTS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE SAW AND IT'S REPRESENTATIVE WHEN YOU KNOW THE COMPANY WAS TRYING TO DO THAT NOT EVEN THROUGH THERE ARE LOCATIONS BANKRUPT IT UNFORTUNATELY SHOWS THAT THERE ARE EXPENSES THAT HAVE TO BE COVERED IN ORDER TO OFFER THIS KIND OF CREDIT TO CONSUMERS THAT ARE GETTING UNFORTUNATELY MAYBE GETTING IT OUT OF STATE WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT AVAILING THEMSELVES OF LICENSED REGULATED AND AUDITED CALIFORNIA COMPANIES SO SOME OF THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO PROPOSALS WITHIN FIRST ONE IT ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS SMALL IS HAVING THE DEPARTMENT NOTATE ON THEIR WEBSITE WHAT IS THE AVAILABLE EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT IS REQUIRED IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION UNDER THE PILOT RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE A LICE IF YOUR LENDER WHO WANTS TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS YOU HAVE TO COULD YOU HAVE TO FORMALLY GROUND TAKE IT TO THE REGULATOR AND THEN ASK THEM TO BLESSED AS OPPOSED TO THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE SO WE WOULD WE FIND IT REALLY HELPFUL AND IT REDUCES THE UP FRONT LENDERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM THEY CAN JUST GO AHEAD THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PRE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND MONEY TO TRY TO FORMULATE A NEW ONCE THE SECOND PROPOSAL -- ALLOWING A MODEST MONTHLY MAINTENANCE FEE RECOGNIZES AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S TIMES LOOKING AT THIS THAT THEIR ONGOING EXPENSES THAT OCCUR BEYOND THE INITIAL ADMIN FEE WHICH COVERS ORIGINATION FUNDING EXPLAINING THE LOAN UP FRONT A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS FOR A TYPE OF LENDING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING COME INTO OUR LOCATION AND THEY WANT TO DEAL IN CASH THEY WANT TO PAYING CASH THAT'S COSTLY YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT NEED TO MANAGE THAT CASH AND PROCESS IT IN ADDITION THERE'S THERE'S INCREASE FOR CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS THEY WANT ANOTHER BALANCES THEY WANT TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE TERMS AND WHAT HAPPENS IF I IGNORE CAN I REFINANCE THAT'S ADDITIONAL LABOR COST IN ORDER TO DISCUSS THOSE WITH CUSTOMERS UP RETRAINING OF EMPLOYEES THE PILOT PROGRAM HAS SOME WONDERFUL CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE TURNOVER IN RETAIL AS YOU ALL KNOW GIVEN THE CURRENT STAFFING SITUATIONS THAT A LOT OF RETAIL COMPANIES HAVE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC THOSE ARE ONGOING COSTS THAT OCCUR ON A REGULAR BASIS SO MONTHLY YOU'RE MONITORING FOR COMPLIANCE IN ADDITION YOUR REPORTING ON A MONTHLY BASIS CREDIT TO THE BIG CREDIT BUREAU SO YOU CAN ASSIST THESE BORROWERS IN ESTABLISHING BETTER CREDIT SCORES THERE'S COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO THE AUTHOR HAS DONE A REALLY GREAT JOB AND RECOGNIZING THAT IN ADDITION TO THE UP FRONT COST COVER YOUR UP FRONT ADDED THE ADMIN FEE FOR UP CUT UP FRONT COSTS THERE ARE ONGOING AND RISING AS I SAY RISING EXPENSES THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING AS CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE TO COVER SO UNTIL THOSE ARE RECOGNIZED YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE GONNA SEE THIS DEARTH OF LANDING THIS CREDIT WASTELAND UNFORTUNATELY BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IT'S CONSUMERS RECOGNIZE THERE ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO MEET THAT SUPPLY BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE COMPANIES THAT ARE MEETING IT THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS THEIR OUT OF STATE THEY'RE NOT EMPLOYING CALIFORNIANS THEY'RE NOT BEING TAXED AS CALIFORNIA COMPANIES LIKE OUR MEMBERS ARE AND WE JUST THANK THE AUTHOR AND THANK THE CHAIR FOR WILLING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WE'RE EXCITED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS COMMITTEE HOUSE TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONIES AND WE WILL NOW GO TO PUBLIC THOSE THAT ARE IN THE ROOM IN SUPPORT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO COME

PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT FOR MAKING ROOM AND PLEASE WHEN YOU ARE READY IF YOU DON'T MIND SELF INTRODUCING THANK YOU HELLO RIGHT HI J. GRAYSON AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LUCY A MATIC'S WITH THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND I'M ALSO REPRESENTING A COALITION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES NONPROFIT AND FAITH LEADERS WHO HAVE COME TOGETHER IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE ORGANIZATIONS WORK TO ENSURE ALL CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS IN OUR LAWS REFLECT THE HIGH STANDARDS AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST ELIMINATE PREDATORY LENDING THAT TARGETS THE MOST ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE CONSUMERS WITH THAT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE SMALL DOLLAR LOAN PILOT PROGRAM THIS BILL WOULD UNDERMINE ALL THE WORK WE HAVE DONE TO KEEP LENDERS FROM STRIPPING WEALTH FROM OUR COMMUNITIES THE PROPOSED MONTHLY MAINTENANCE FEE OF FORTY DOLLARS ON LOANS FROM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS NOTHING SHORT OF ABUSIVE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW LENDERS TO CHARGE THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO HUNDRED PERCENT APR ON A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN AND SEVENTY ONE PERCENT APR ON A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN THE FBI DATA SHOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF PILOT LOANS MADE ARE TO PEOPLE BUT MAKING BETWEEN TWENTY THOUSAND TO FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THESE CONSUMERS IN PARTICULAR SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF HIGH COST DEBT WHEN SEEKING LOANS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BENEFICIAL ALTERNATIVES TO PREDATORY LENDING CALIFORNIA MADE GREAT STRIDES IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PATH EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY NINE THIS AT A RATE CAP ON INSTALLMENT LOANS WHICH WE PROBABLY WORKED ALONGSIDE CHAIR GRAYSON AT THE BILL CO AUTHOR TO PASS UNDER THIS LAW TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOANS HAVEN'T APR CLOSER TO THIRTY SIX PERCENT ALMOST HALF OF WHAT THIS NEW BILL PROPOSES THEREFORE AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE WOULD MOVE US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND PROVIDE A LOOPHOLE FOR LENDERS TO TARGET AND PREY UPON CONSUMERS I'VE COMMUNITIES HARDEST HIT BY THE CLUB IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC OR TRYING TO RECOVER FROM RELATED ECONOMIC SETBACKS WE SIMPLY CANNOT BLESSED ASTRONOMICAL INTEREST RATES TO BE OFFERED THROUGH A PROGRAM THAT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD AB TWENTY THIRD TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE AS WELL AS ANY FUTURE ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN MEMBERS LISA LEWIS HERE ON BEHALF OF EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER AND CALIFORNIA'S FOR ECONOMIC ECONOMIC JUSTICE COALITION HERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION CALIFORNIA HAS MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE NUMEROUS WAYS CONSUMERS FACE PREDATORY FINANCIAL PRACTICES AND PRIOR TO PASSING THE RATE CAP IN TWENTY NINETEEN TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST LOANS WERE WREAKING HAVOC IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND DRIVING CALIFORNIANS INTO SIGNIFICANT CYCLES OF DEBT AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE IS A STEP BACKWARDS I WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO THIS TYPE OF LENDING ALL OVER AGAIN INDUSTRY KEEPS TRYING TO CLAIM THAT THIS TYPE OF LENDING HELPS CREATE ACCESS TO CREDIT AND THAT THIS IS JUST UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE PILOT PROGRAM HOWEVER AS ADVOCATES ON THE GROUND WE KNOW BETTER TO ADD FEES TO A LOAN THAT IS ALREADY INTENDED FOR FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED PERSON IS FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE IF THE CONSUMER NEEDS ALONE IN THE FIRST PLACE ADDING MORE COSTS FIFTEEN THE LOAN IS SIMPLY ILLOGICAL TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF LOANS MADE UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM WHERE DELINQUENT FOR SEVEN TO TWENTY NINE DAYS ADDING COSTS THESE LOANS THROUGH A MAINTENANCE FEE OR BY RAISING INTEREST RATES ALLOWED TO BE CHARGED WILL ONLY MAKE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT GREATER FOR THESE BORROWERS NO ONE IS DOING ANY FAVORS BY OFFERING A PREDATORY SERVICE TO FILL A GAP THAT HAS BEEN MADE BY LARGER SYSTEMIC ISSUES THE VERY SAME SYSTEM THAT IS BECOMES THAT BECOMES OVERBURDEN WHEN IMPACTED CONSUMERS SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO TREAD WATER ANY LONGER IN THE WAKE OF COBIT AND THE ECONOMIC PRESSURES IT HAS CREATED FOR MANY FAMILIES IS NOT THE TIME TO SCALE BACK OUR INNOVATIONS HAVE WORKED WITH MANY OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF RESOURCES OF ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PRODUCTS ALLOWING THESE RATES TO COME BACK IS TAKING US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SO WHILE THERE IS NOT A VOTE ON THIS MEASURE TODAY WE DO EMPLOYER TO STAY THE COURSE AND CONTINUE SENDING THE MESSAGES THE MESSAGE THAT BUSINESS ENTITIES THAT MAKE THEIR PROFITS OFF THE VULNERABILITIES OF DISTRESSED CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE A PLACE IN CALIFORNIA OUR CONSUMERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND DESERVE

QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE AND AS WE BEGIN I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AUTHOR FOR YOUR INTENTIONS AND WANTING TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SO -- FOR THAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE WELL NOTED AND -- I I I I ALSO THINK THAT -- SINCE AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WHICH DID ADDRESS THE LOAN HUNDRED UP TO I BELIEVE IT WAS TEN THOUSAND -- AND WHAT YOUR TRYING TO ADDRESS IS ACTUALLY BETWEEN THE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MARK IS THAT CORRECT ALL RIGHT SO SO WITH THAT I THINK THERE'S A VACUUM OF OF DATA WE WERE MISSING A LOT AND A LOT OF DATA AND THE QUESTION WAS POSED BY PROPONENTS -- WHERE DID THOSE PEOPLE GO BUT THAT WAS ACTUALLY FOR FIVE THIRTY NINE WHICH IS NOT YOURS SPACE FOR THIS BILL THIS SPACE HAS BEEN THE SAME SENSE HOWEVER WAS NOTED THAT THERE WERE SOME FAIL AND WE'RE DOWN TO ONE LEFT SO WITH THAT -- I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IF IF EITHER SIDE HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN ABLE TO FIND DATA TO SHOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE AB FIVE THIRTY NINE -- ESSENCE THAT WENT INTO LAW AND -- I I ALSO WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE FBI AND THE NEW RESEARCH ARM THAT IS BEING BUILT THERE THAT I BELIEVE WOULD BE OF VERY INTEGRAL TO BEING ABLE TO GET THE DATA THAT I'M ASKING FOR HOWEVER HAVE YOU ALL BEEN ABLE TO FIND DATA ON YOUR OWN MISTER CHAIRMAN BOB SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE DE APENAS ATTEMPT TO TRY TO GET DATA FOR THIS PARTICULAR SPACE UNFORTUNATELY THROUGH THE YEARS HAS NOT BEEN A REPORT THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES IT FROM THE REGULATOR WHAT I CAN DO IS EXPRESS -- SOME DATA THAT WE DO HAVE IN IT ALTHOUGH SOME OF IT IS ANECDOTAL BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A FORMALIZED STUDY FROM OUR REGULATOR ON IT IT'S THERE IS WHEN CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS GO ON THE INTERNET AND THE ATTEMPT TO FIND A LOAN WHICH IS USUALLY LIKE ALL OF US WEEKLY GOOGLE SOMETHING SO WHEN YOU GOOGLE YOU'RE GONNA FIND MILLIONS OF HITS WHEN YOU GOOGLE CALIFORNIA PERSONAL LOANS FOR CALIFORNIA INSTALLMENT LOANS THE THERE ARE COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT CONSOLIDATE THIS DATA AND PROVIDE LEADS TO COMPANIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO LEND TO THESE CONSUMERS WHAT WE'VE SOUGHT FROM THIS SET OF DOUBT IS IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE WAS OVER SIXTEEN MILLION REQUESTS FOR LOANS THAT WERE DONE ONLINE AND OF THAT ONLY ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT OF THEM WENT TO CALIFORNIA LICENSE LENDERS SO WHAT DOES THAT SPEAK UP ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE EXACT OUT OF THAT THEY WENT TO THESE PARTICULAR LENDERS BUT WAIT A MINUTE WE HAVE ALMOST NINETY EIGHT MORE THAN NINETY EIGHT PERCENT ARE NOT LENDING A ARE NOT LANDING AT LICENSE LENDERS IN CALIFORNIA I MEAN SOME AND IT'S NOT THAT NINETY PERCENT DIDN'T GET LOANS SO LOGIC TELLS US THAT THEY'RE GETTING LOANS ARE JUST NOT GETTING LOANS THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE DAPI AND THANK YOU FOR THAT I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DISTURBANCE WE WILL HEAR ALSO -- FROM FROM YOU AS FAR AS DATA I AM GOING TO HAND CHAIR -- THE GAVEL OVER TO MR STONE I HAVE TO GO PRESENT AND REVAN TAX THE BILL WERE THEY'RE GONNA CLOSED MEETING WITHOUT HEARING FROM ME MR STONE IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO TAKE OVER PERFECT SO I WILL ADD AND AGAIN MY NAME IS LUCY A MATIC'S WITH ANTIPERSPIRANTS BLENDING ALL ADD THAT AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WENT TO EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY AND SHORTLY IF YOU MEANT THREE MONTHS INTO THE YEAR THE PANDEMIC HIT RIGHT AND SO WE SAW LENDING DOWN ACROSS THE BOARD NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LET THE D. FBI GAME A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO COLLECT MORE DATA BUT ALSO WE SAW THAT CONSUMERS WERE ABLE TO ACCESS LOANS THAT THE BUY NOW PAY LATER PRODUCTS FOR EXAMPLE MADE UP FOR NINETY ONE PERCENT OF NON BANK LOANS DURING THAT TIME AND TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE LAST DATA THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE DATA FROM THE FBI SO FOLKS WERE ACT AND THOSE LENDERS ARE LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA SO THE IDEA THAT FOLKS WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS ANY LOANS IS NOT TRUE IN OUR IN OUR OPINION WHAT WE'VE BEEN SPLIT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN THE DATA AND WE HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME SINCE EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY NINE HAS BEEN IN EFFECT TO SEE WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE ON THE GROUND SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED SOME MORE TIME AWAY FROM THIS IRREGULAR ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN DUE TO THE PANDEMIC TO SEE HOW THESE LOANS BEAR OUT AND HOW THESE PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS I THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISS WILSON THANK YOU TO DR AND MRS HELPS THE LEARNING I'M THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND OF THIS IS THAT REALLY IMPORTANT -- THE PILOT PROGRAM IS VERY MUCH NECESSARY -- AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS IS GOOD ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WITH LOW CREDIT ARMS ARE LOWER CREDIT SCORES OR NO CREDIT SCORES AT ALL WHEN I WAS LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY TO EACH FOR THE BOTH PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF IT AND WONDER IF IT COULD BE CLARIFIED IT WAS NOTED -- IN THE PROPONENT THAT -- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT'S SAFE AND REGULATED AND IT WAS NOTED IN THE OPPONENT THAT IT SHOULD BE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE TWO DIFFERENT WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU IN TERMS OF SAFE AND REGULATED VERSUS SAFE AFFORDABLE OR ONE OF THE IF YOU DON'T MIND I CAN GO AHEAD AND FILL THAT ONE SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A BALANCE THE PILOT PROGRAM'S BEEN AROUND YOU KNOW FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND THERE'S GREAT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN IT AND THE LENDERS THAT ARE LOOKING TO LONDON OR WANT THOSE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO TO CONTINUE TO OFFER THAT SO THIS IS THIS IS THE BALANCE HOW DO YOU ATTRACT MORE LENDERS AND IN RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT HAPPENING RIGHT THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE LENDER AND IT ISN'T IT'S NOT FOR THE LAST YEAR THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND THE ONE AND WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT FIRST LENDER TOOK HIM SEVEN YEARS TO GET PROFITABLE SO YOU'RE GONNA ATTRACT ANOTHER LIKE YOU KNOW OTHER LENDERS WE DO HAVE TO FIND THAT BALANCE YOU'RE RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE FOR THE CONSUMER THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS BUT IF THE LENDER CANNOT LAND AND COVER THE EXPENSES YOU'RE JUST NOT GONNA HAVE ANY LENDING AND THAT'S WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING SO THAT IS THAT IS THE BALANCE WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO COVER EXPENSES FOR THE LENDER AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS DOING THAT OTHER STATES HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS ON GOING MONTHLY EXPENSES AND WE AND IT'S RECOGNIZING THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO HELP ATTRACT NEW LENDERS THAT ARE WILLING TO BE LICENSED AND REGULATED AND AUDITED I THINK THE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I WOULD SAY SOME OF THE OTHER STATES POINTED TO THE ARE ALSO LEARNING FOR TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST RATES AND THAT'S GOING AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE PIECE THAT YOU JEFF REYES AT THAT POINT SO THERE'S A BALANCE I AGREE BUT MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF CHARGING FORTY DOLLARS PER MONTH ON ITS SURFACE REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THE LOAN YOU'RE LOOKING AT CHARGING SOMEONE ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR AT THE FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH -- THAT COST THERE AND SO THERE ARE OTHER SOLUTIONS WE CAN EXPLORE BUT TACKING ON THAT COST OF BOOKS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE'RE MAKING AT MOST FORTY FIVE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THESE CONSUMERS ON THIS PROGRAM AGAIN UNDER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S THE WRONG SOLUTION AND WRONG CALCULUS BECAUSE THE EMPHASIS IS BEING PLACED ON ON ON LENDERS AND HOW THEY CAN BECOME PROFITABLE AS OPPOSED TO CONSUMERS AND HOW THEY CAN REALLY GET ACCESS TO THOSE STATE LOANS BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THEY ARE ACCESSING LOANS AND THE FINAL ACCESS TO CREDIT -- AND SO IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS STRONGER I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER CALCULUS THAT WE CAN COME TO AND WE NEED SOME MORE TIME TO COLLECT THAT DATA AND NOW TO THE CHAIR HOW HOW DOES THE IT SAYS NOT TO EXCEED FORTY DOLLARS ON THE MAX AMOUNT AND I THOUGHT I HEARD DURING THE TESTIMONY THAT THERE POTENTIALLY COULD BE A TIERED SYSTEM AS OTHER STATES MAY DO AND SO A LOT OF TIMES AND YOU SEE A MAXIMUM IT USUALLY MEANS THAT FEMALE RATE AND THEN IT ALSO HAS THE JUST FORMULATION SO IT SEEMS LIKE IF IF IT'S SET INTO -- AND IF IT'S IF IT'S WRITTEN THIS WAY AND THERE'S NO CAP EVEN ON THAT YOU COULD EVENTUALLY GET TO WHERE IT'S PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS AND JUST ON THE EXAMPLE HERE IT HAS THE TRIPLE DIGITS WHICH IS UP THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WAS TO AVOID THAT YOU COULD COULD YOU TELL TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HOW THE -- THE MONTHLY MAINTENANCE FEE WORKS IS EXPECTED TO BE FORTY DOLLARS PER -- LOAN AND IS IT EXPECTED HERE BECAUSE THERE IS -- IN TERMS OF HOW HIGH IT CAN GO IN TERMS OF THE ANNUAL INFLATION EACH YEAR UNDERSTOOD AND ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CLARIFY BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT GETS LOST THE INTEREST RATE IS NOT A TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST RATE THE INTEREST RATE IS NOT CHANGING UNDER THIS BILL THERE'S A SET INTEREST RATES THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOTAL COSTS ALONE IN THE ACTUAL INTEREST RATE IS ONE MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE -- RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S IT'S THAT THE MAXIMUM UNDER THE PILOT AT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT IS THIRTY SIX PERCENT ALTHOUGH THERE IS ADDITION THIS MONTH THE MONTHLY MAINTENANCE FEE DOES INTRODUCE ANOTHER COST SO WHEN YOU DO AN APR -- IT DOES SHOW THE NUMBERS THAT WE SAW IN THE ANALYSIS I THINK WHAT IS HELPFUL AS I THINK THE ANALYSIS DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF POINTING OUT SOMETIMES IT IS NOT THE BEST INDICATOR OF THE COSTA CREDIT BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE LOANS ARE NOT OUT FOR YEARS YOU KNOW OVER A YEAR OR TWO SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE V. THIS BILL IS A STARTING POINT INTRODUCING A TYPE OF STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE LENDERS I MEAN I THINK US AS THE A COMMUNITY OF LENDERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO LENDER THIS WE'VE BEEN TRYING WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR OVER WITH THE PILOT PROGRAMS OVER ELEVEN TEN ELEVEN YEARS TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT DOES WORK WE'RE WE'RE OPEN AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROGRAM AND INTRODUCING A A A RECOGNITION THAT THERE'S ONGOING EXPENSES ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO THE LENDER IN ORDER TO HAVE THE BAR ACCESS THIS CREDIT BOB WE RESPECT THAT M. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THEY THE AUTHORS DONE A GOOD JOB SHOWING THAT HEY THIS ISN'T EXPECTED EXPENSE IS IT FORTY IS GONNA BE LESS THAN THAT THE WORLD INTO THOSE DISCUSSIONS BOB WE'RE OPEN TO OTHER SOLUTIONS WE WOULD ASK YOU KNOW THOSE THAT MAY BE IN OPPOSITION YOU KNOW THERE'S USUALLY A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHY THIS ISN'T WORKING BUT WE DON'T HEAR A LOT OF SUGGESTIONS BY HER PAID BY NOW PAY LATER WE SAW A HUGE INCREASE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE DIDN'T THE REASONS THAT THE REGULATOR STATED IN THE END REPORTS AS TO WHY PEOPLE TAKE A PILOT PROGRAM LOANS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TO BUY GOODS YOU KNOW THERE'S EMERGENCIES AT THEIR EXPERIENCE AND I THINK WE'RE GETTING ABOUT THE QUEST THE QUESTION WAS SPECIFIC TO THE THAT THE FORTY DOLLARS FORTY DOLLARS YEAH AND THEN IT SO EIGHT NINE OR DO YOU YOU ECHOED -- SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID EARLIER IN TERMS OF NOT SURE FORTY DOLLARS IS THE RIGHT NUMBER WHICH IN MY MIND FLAGS IT'S ARBITRARY AND SO I WAS VERY BEEN ANY ANY DATA GIVEN AT ALL AND MAYBE NOT HERE BUT DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE THAT SAYS IT USUALLY COSTS THIS MUCH TO MAINTAIN A SMALL DOLLAR LOAN BETWEEN THAT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS A COST BECAUSE OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS IS THAT DATA THIS IS THE SOFTWARE THAT WE HAVE TO INCLUDE YOU KNOW THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WAS THERE DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE WHITE FORTY DOLLARS AMOUNT OR IS IT UNDER SO IT'S IT'S NOT EXACTLY IT'S IT'S NOT ARBITRARY IN THAT THERE WERE IN THE THERE WAS LOOK YOU LOOK AT OTHER STATES AND WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AND AS WE MENTIONED I BELIEVE THAT MR MOFFETT'S TESTAMENT HE MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER STATES THAT HAVE PASSED THIS CONCEPT ONE OF THEM WAS OHIO AND WE LOOK AT OHIO AND LOOKED AT WHAT THEY WERE DOING I BELIEVE THAT THAT AMOUNT WE SAID IT THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER BECAUSE OF HIGH BECAUSE COSTING CALIFORNIA THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN OPERATING IN THE STATE OF OHIO AND SO THAT'S WHERE THAT NUMBER CAME FROM BOB IT RECOGNIZES THAT THE -- THAT STATE DID SOME MATH CALIFORNIA WE RECOGNIZE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS HERE IS HIGHER SO THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION IF I HEARD CORRECTLY THERE'S NO YET JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AMOUNT OF FORTY DOLLARS EXCEPT SETTING IT AT A RATE AGAINST OHIO OF THIRTY PERCENT IN ADVANCE THAT WAS ONE WAY TO GET TO THIS NUMBER -- AT THIS POINT AND I'M NOT PREPARED TO GIVE YOU AN ACTUAL BREAKDOWN I DATED KHLOE DOLLARS RIGHT HEARING CORRECTLY ON THAT OKAY THANK YOU AND IT'S NOTED THAT OHIO HAS A VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAM INCLUDING IN LOWER INTEREST RATES SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH OR OR MONTHLY FEE THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT AND YES WE'VE CAP SHE SO THAT A MEMBER THIS COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS AND THROUGH THIS AND THROUGH THE SENATE TOOK A NUMBER OF YEARS TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE COULD GET ENOUGH CONTROL OVER INTEREST RATES AND AND TRY AND PROTECT CONSUMERS IN THIS SPACE TO THE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE SO IT'S I GUESS SOME FOR ME A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS STEP RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY WITH THAT THE LACK OF DATA THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN THE SMALL DOLLAR LOANS AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE RESERVE OPPOSE OR FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH ON A FIVE HUNDRED TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN IS A LOT AND THE INTEREST RATE IS THERE FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS YES YOU TALK ABOUT A FEVER SINCE AN INTEREST RATE BUT TO CONSUMER ITS COST OF MONEY TO THAT CONSUMER AND WE'RE TALKING GETTING BACK TO SOME EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT CONSUMERS CAN END UP HAVING TO PAY FOR THAT ORIGINAL LOAN TO THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN THE VERY WARY OF THESE KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS UP FOR ME I'M WAS CLASS THAT THIS WAS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING I THINK IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PILOT PROGRAM OTHERS WORK THE LOANS AVAILABILITY IN THIS DOLLAR RANGE OKAY THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION TO HAVE BUT WITHOUT THE DATA AND THE FACT IS THAT THE REGULATOR STARTING TO LOOK AND COLLECT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE USEFUL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS OFF OF THAT AND THEN A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS SO HAVING BEEN AROUND THIS FOR SUCH TIME JUST CALL ME SKEPTICAL AT THIS POINT ANYWAY -- I THINK THAT EXHAUSTS ARE QUESTIONS MR THE APPROVER YOU MAY CLOSE YES WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK WE WE ALL NEED A ROBUST A PROGRAM FOR CALIFORNIA AS YOU HEARD A LOT OF FOLKS ARE GOING TO OUT OF THE STATE AND I LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU KNOW GOING ON ONLINE SOME SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T TRUST THAT I MEAN THEY DON'T THEY WANT TO GO INTO A STORE AND TALK TO SOMEONE THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE TOUCH AND SPEAK AND AND BE ONLINE SOMETIMES YOU DON'T HAVE THAT AND THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS BEING ASKED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY THE COSTS EXPENSIVE WE'RE IN CALIFORNIA A REMINDER SO EVEN IF YOU COMPARE OTHER STATES ARE STILL LIVING CALIFORNIA TO PUT A STOREFRONT IT'S NOT CHEAP IT'S EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW SO -- WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN RELY ON PEOPLE TO HAVE TRUST THAT THEY CAN WE ARE WE ARE GOING TO SO MANY ISSUES AND PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO TO TALK WHO TO TURN TO AND ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT IT WHEN THEY NEED ALONE THAT THEY CAN GO TO THAT STORE THEY CAN GO TO THAT PERSON WHO THEY FEEL THEY'RE TO ME THAT THEY CAN TRUST SO I L. LEAVE THAT WITH YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU CAN THINK OF RIGHT WE JUST HAD ONE ITEM OF INFORMATION ONLY AND WITH THAT WE ARE ADJOURNED
