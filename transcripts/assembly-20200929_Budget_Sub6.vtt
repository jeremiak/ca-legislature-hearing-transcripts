OUR STATE HAS BEEN PREPARING

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:00.912
NOT INHERENTLY FOR PANDEMICS BUT

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:03.181

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.577
DOING AN OUTREACH AND INVESTING

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:41.346
IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE MAKING

00:29:41.412 --> 00:29:43.281
A DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW BUT I

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:45.450
WOULD JUST BE REMISS NOT TO TALK

00:29:45.517 --> 00:29:46.851
ABOUT MY REGION I'VE BEEN A BIT

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:49.087
OUTSPOKEN WANTING TO MAKE SURE

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:51.256
THAT FRESNO IS MOVING FORWARD

00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:53.324
AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:54.926
TO RECEIVE INFORMATION WHETHER

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:56.528
OR NOT WE MOVE FROM PURPLE INTO

00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:59.330
RED WE HAVE A GLIMMER OF HOPE

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:02.200
BUT I WOULD JUST WANT US TO BE

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:03.868
VIGILANT AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:05.670
IS NOT THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:08.406
BECAUSE IF WE DO GROUND OURSELF

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:10.041
IN THIS AS THE PANDEMIC OF THE

00:30:10.108 --> 00:30:11.876
CENTURY WE WILL ALSO LOOK BACK

00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:14.212
TO NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AND REALIZE

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.713
THAT THE MOST THE HIGHEST

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.549
MORTALITY CAME FROM SEPTEMBER

00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:19.484
TO DECEMBER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:21.386
THAT IT IS THESE MONTHS THAT

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:22.987
ARE CRUCIAL THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:24.522
VIGILANT AND MAKING SURE WE'RE

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:26.391
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:29.060
SUPPORT OUR STATE AND TO ME

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:30.862

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:32.430
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:33.998
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION I THINK

00:30:34.065 --> 00:30:35.733
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.235
HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE PURSE

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:38.770
STRINGS AND TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:40.004

OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS

00:31:09.133 --> 00:31:10.468
AND CALIFORNIA WITH A LOT

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:12.103
OF IMPROVEMENTS AND MOVEMENT

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.304

THIS IS A TIME WHERE -- FLU

00:31:21.746 --> 00:31:23.114

AND ALL OF THEM INTERVENTIONS

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.217
GIRL DOING THIS PHYSICALLY

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:27.852
DISTANCING WEARING AMOUNTS

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:29.587
ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:31.389
-- AS WE SLOWLY AND SAFELY

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:32.257
WHICH WILL BE THE THEME OF

00:31:32.323 --> 00:31:34.192
MY PRESENTATION TO ALLOW FOR

00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:35.526
THINGS RE OPEN WE CANNOT LET

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:36.828
OUR GUARD DOWN SO THAT WE CAN

00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:38.529
MAINTAIN OUR PROGRESS WE HAVE

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:39.831
SEEN IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IN THE

00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:42.100
ASEAN SECRETARY GALA IS PRESS

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:43.368
CONFERENCE ON FRIDAY THAT WE

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:45.370
ARE SEEING SOME PLATEAUS AND

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:46.838
WE AGAIN WANT TO GO SLOWLY AND

00:31:46.904 --> 00:31:49.073
SAFELY SO -- AGAIN WE CANNOT

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.241
LET OUR GUARD DOWN BUT WE ALSO

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:51.609
WANT ALLOWED THINGS RESUME

00:31:52.644 --> 00:31:53.945
SO WITH THAT I WILL TALK TO YOU

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:55.046
ABOUT OUR CALIFORNIA BLUEPRINT

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:57.248
FOR SAFER ECONOMY AND IT'S

00:31:57.315 --> 00:31:59.317
A PLAN ESSENTIALLY TOO SLOWLY

00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:00.418
WE LUNCH ON AUGUST THIRTY

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:02.420
FIRST TO GRADUALLY ALLOW FOR

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:04.322
LOOSENING -- BUT ALSO HOW IT

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:05.523
WOULD IMPACT ITS RESTRICTIVE

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:06.791
THINGS VARIOUS SECTORS AND

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.826
ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:10.628
HELLO TO ALLOW RE OPENING OF

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:11.963
ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESSES AFTER

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.097
THE STAY AT HOME ORDER THAT

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:15.933
STARTED IN MARCH IN IN JULY

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:18.369
EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:20.738
COLOR CODED AND BASED ON A RADIO

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.240
TEST POSITIVITY IS THAT THE

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:23.541
NUMBER OF POSITIVE TESTS OVER

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:24.642
ALL THE TESTS THAT ARE DONE

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:26.544
TEST POSITIVITY AND CASE RATES

00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:27.912
SO THE CASE RATE IS ESSENTIALLY

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:29.180
THE NUMBER OF CASES IN EACH

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:31.549
COUNTY DEVIDED BY IT'S A PER

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.217
CAPITA NUMBER AND THEN THERE

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:34.485
ISN'T JUSTICE AND WE'RE LOOKING

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:35.987
AT THOSE PER DAY SO THE CASE

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:37.455
RATE OF PEOPLE THREE HUNDRED

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:39.123
THOUSAND PER DAY AND THEN WE

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.792
JUST NOT PROTESTING VOLUME AND

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:41.959
THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE WANT

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.394
TO MAKE SURE COUNTIES ARE DOING

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:45.530
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO CONTINUE

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.731
TO TEST AND DO WHAT WE CALL

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:48.499
CASE FINDING AND YOU FIND MORE

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:49.567
CASES ARE GOING TO INCREASE YOUR

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:51.035
CASE RIGHT SO AS COUNTIES ARE

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.370
DOING A LOT OF TESTING WE HAVE

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.038
SOME ADJUSTMENTS AROUND THAT TO

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:55.406
ALLOW FOR THAT AN INCREASE IN

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:58.109
TESTING SO THE OVERALL GOALS

00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:00.078
AGAIN OR TO CONTINUE TO AGAIN

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:01.846
SLOWLY AND STRINGENTLY ALLOW

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:03.715
THE THE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:05.350
BUT ALSO MAINTAIN A REDUCE

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:07.618
TRANSMISSION SO AS MENTIONED

00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:09.187
YOU KNOW OUR WINTER IS COMING

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:11.055
-- A LOT OF THE SEEMS TO SEE AS

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:12.190
I TALK ABOUT THE SECTORS THAT

00:33:12.256 --> 00:33:14.125
ARE ALLOWED OR NOT ALLOWED ARE

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:16.060
UP -- IT'S SAFER TO HAVE THINGS

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:17.528
OUTDOORS WITH THIS VIRUS BUT WE

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:19.130
KNOW THAT SOON WILL BE FORCED

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:21.165
TO DO MORE THINGS INDOORS AND

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:22.233
JUST THAT'S A NATURAL THING

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.134
TO DO AND OF COURSE WE'VE

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.102
SEEN SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:25.436
WITH THE RECENT WILDFIRES

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:28.005
AND AIR QUALITY IN HEAT --

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:29.574
AND AGAIN THE IMPACT IS TO

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.442
SEASON TYPICALLY WILL STRESS

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:32.844
OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM EVEN

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:34.946
JUST FLEW A LOAN WITH A BAD

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:36.147
FLU SEASON CAN REALLY STRESS

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:37.181
OUR SYSTEM AND WE'RE REALLY

00:33:37.248 --> 00:33:38.082
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:39.450
CONCERNED ABOUT A POTENTIAL

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:41.619
TO ENDEMIC OR HAVE FLU AND CO

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:43.154
THE NINETEEN CASES FILLING OUR

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:45.623
HOSPITALS THIS WINTER SO BI

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.358
LINE IS PHASED IN RE OPENING

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:48.593
THAT HAS VARIOUS CHANGES IN

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:50.628
SECTORS AND THINKING ABOUT THAT

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.029
SECTOR'S POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.065
TO DISEASE TRANSMISSION WE

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.600
CAME UP WITH THIS FRAMEWORK

00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:57.969
TO -- HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS

00:33:58.035 --> 00:33:59.070
FOR COUNTIES AND BENCHMARKS

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:00.371
THAT THEY COULD SEE TO

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:03.107
ACHIEVE TO MOVE FORWARD SO

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:04.675
AGAIN THE BENCHMARK HAS WE

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.544
MOVE FROM WIDESPREAD JUST THE

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:08.946
PURPLE TIER TWO SUBSTANTIAL

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:10.515
JUST THE RED TIER TRANSMISSION

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:12.316
AND THEN MODERATE IS ORANGE AND

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:14.719
MINIMAL IS YELLOW AND EACH

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:15.920
COUNTY AGAIN WAS A SIGN ON

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.221
AUGUST THIRTY FIRST ONE OF THOSE

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:19.424
COLORS BASED ON THE THE CASE

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:21.359
REYES AND SEVENTY IN EACH COUNTY

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.695
AND -- I JUST WANTED

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:26.130
TO MENTION THAT OF COURSE LIKE

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:27.298
EVERYTHING ELSE AND WE ALL

00:34:27.365 --> 00:34:28.566
LEARNED SO MUCH IN THE LAST

00:34:29.033 --> 00:34:30.902
NINE MONTHS OF THIS PANDEMIC

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:33.070
-- AND IT CONTINUES OF ALL

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:36.174
A LOT OF THE LEARNING WE'VE DONE

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.608
WAS PUT INTO THIS FRAMEWORK AND

00:34:37.842 --> 00:34:38.976
AS THINGS OF ALL WILL CONTINUE

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.611
TO REASSESS THESE METRICS AND

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:42.380
THRESHOLDS WITH THE DATA WE HAVE

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:43.548
BOTH IN THE STATE AND LOOKING

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:46.117
NATIONALLY AND GLOBALLY SO WHAT

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:47.518
THIS RUMOR DID WAS REPLACE THE

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:48.986
PREVIOUS COUNTY DATA MONITORING

00:34:49.053 --> 00:34:50.488
THIS WHICH WAS REALLY AN HONOR

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:52.156
OFFICE HE COUNTY'S READER ON

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:53.691
THE LIST ARE OFF THE LIST AND

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.593
THEN MANY THINGS WERE EVEN OPEN

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.228
OR CLOSED SO WE REALLY WANT TO

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:58.729
COME OUT WITH A PAYMENT AGAIN

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.231
THAT HAS TEARS AND PHASES OF

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:01.299
PEOPLE COULD SORT OF SLOWLY

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:02.333
AND SAFELY MARCHED THROUGH

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.801
THEM AND ALSO THE DIFFERENT

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:05.203
SECTORS POTENTIALLY START TO

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:07.004
OPEN CAREFULLY AT A SMALLER

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:08.773
CAPACITY OR START OUTDOORS

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:09.807
AND THEN GRADUALLY MOVED

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:11.309
INDOORS YOU'LL SEE THAT THEME

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:12.610
AND DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:13.978
WHAT'S ALLOWED IN DIFFERENT

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:15.413
SECTORS AND DIFFERENT TIERS

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:19.717
AS OF SUIT AGAINST KIND

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.519
OF REVIEW THE RULES OF THIS

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:23.354
REMARK SO AGAIN WE ASSIGNED

00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:25.223
ALL THE COUNTIES TO IT HERE ON

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:26.824
AUGUST THIRTY FIRST AND WHAT WE

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:29.060
LOOKED AT WAS -- WE LOOKED AT

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.561
SEVEN DAY CASE REYES AND SEVENTY

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.296
TEST POSITIVITY AND WE LOOK AT

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:33.598
THOSE WITH THE SEVEN DAY LAG

00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:34.599
BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:35.666
BIT OF TIME THAT'S DEFINITELY

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:37.201
IMPROVED OUR TURNAROUND TIME NOW

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:38.603
THE STATE IS AN AVERAGE OF ONE

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:40.438
POINT TWO DAYS BUT IT DOES TAKE

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:42.139
TIME BETWEEN THE TIME THE PERSON

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:44.041
IS TESTED THE TEST RESULTS COME

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:45.476
AND THAT WE RECEIVE THAT DATA

00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:46.744
AT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:48.679
SO WE GET THE MOST ACCURATE

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:51.482
-- BALANCE OF ACCOUNTING FOR

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:52.717
TIME DELAYS IN GETTING THE TEST

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:54.285
RESULTS BUT ALSO NOT BEING TO

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:55.786
BEHIND AND LOOKING AT OUR TRENDS

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:58.389
THAT THE SEVEN DAY LACKS -- WE

00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:00.191
LOOK AT THOSE WEEKLY WE RUN A

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:01.659
DATA EVERY MONDAY AND THEN WE

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:02.994
LET THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.529
NO ON MONDAY AFTERNOON TO

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:05.696
GET A BARGAIN LIST OF WHERE

00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:06.430
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S GOING TO

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:08.332
BE AND THEN ON TUESDAYS SO AT

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:09.433
NOON TODAY WILL BE ANNOUNCING

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.768
WHERE THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.770
ARE GOING TO MOVE TO SO SOME

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:13.938
OF THE OTHER BASELINE RULES

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.840
ARE AGAIN AS IN THE SPIRIT OF

00:36:15.907 --> 00:36:17.675
MOVING SLOWLY EVERY COUNTING

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:19.377
IS V. AND A CERTAIN TEAR FOR

00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:21.679
AT LEAST THREE WEEKS SO AGAIN

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:23.414
IDEAS AND YOU LOOK AT MODELING

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:25.750
OF THE IMPACT OF OPENING THINGS

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.118
OR ARE PEOPLE INTERACTING

00:36:27.184 --> 00:36:28.519
MORE AND MIXING MORE IT TAKES

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:30.755
TYPICALLY TWO TO FOUR WEEKS TO

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.123
SEE THE IMPACT OF THAT BASED ON

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:33.257
THE COMMISSION PARENT OF THIS

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:35.726
VIRUS SO AGAIN THE RULES EVERY

00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:37.128
COUNTY HAS TO BE IN A PHASE

00:36:37.194 --> 00:36:39.697
FOR THREE WEEKS -- ALSO

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.165
THE COUNTY SAY YOU'RE IN PURPLE

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:42.867
AND YEAR TESTING POSITIVITY

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.101
IN YOUR CASE RATE IMPROVE VERY

00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:45.770
QUICKLY HERE SOMEHOW AN ORANGE

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:47.138
YOU CANNOT SKIP RIGHT YOU

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:48.506
STILL HAVE TO GO NEXT TO RED

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:49.941
HAT TO BE THREE WEEKS AND READ

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:51.976
BEFORE YOU CAN DO SO AGAIN WE

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:53.978
WANT TO DO THIS SAFELY SLOWLY

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.949
AND ALSO THE OTHER RULES ARE

00:36:58.015 --> 00:36:59.584
THAT IF THE COUNTY HAS AGAIN

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.686
SAY YOU'RE IN PURPLE AND THEN

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.854
-- YOU HAVE THAT TEST POSITIVITY

00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:05.623
AND READ BUT YOU'RE TO HIS

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.258
GREATEST ON PURPLE YOU STILL

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:08.859
REMAIN AT THE MORE RESTRICTIVE

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.127
COLOR CODE THANK YOU DON'T YOU

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:11.462
CAN HAVE A TO RENTAL BOTH YOUR

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:13.464
CASE RATE AND A TEST POSITIVE

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:15.166
HERE AND LESS RESTRICTIVE TEAR

00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:19.070
DURING THE WEEKLY SAY

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:21.906
ASSESSMENTS -- WE LOOK AT AGAIN

00:37:21.973 --> 00:37:23.608
LOOK AT THE THE PRIOR WEEK AND

00:37:23.674 --> 00:37:25.242
THE WEEK BEFORE SO IN ORDER TO

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.744
MOVE FORWARD AFTER THREE WEEKS

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:28.245
YOU HAVE TO MEET TWO WEEKS

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:30.615
OF CRITERIA OF BEING THE LESS

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:31.749
RESTRICTIVE HERE SO IF YOU'RE

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.818
IN PURPLE NOW THAT LAST WEEK YOU

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:35.152
MIGHT READ IT AND WEEP FOR YOU

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:36.854
THAT RIGHT THEN YOU CAN GO CHECK

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.423
THAT TODAY SO THAT'S AGAIN SO

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.858
YOU HAVE TO STAY IN ONE PLACE

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:41.759
FOR THREE WEEKS BUT THEN IN

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:42.994
ORDER TO SHOW YOUR PROGRESS AND

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.062
STABLE PROGRESS YOU HAVE TO SHOW

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.831
YOUR COUNTY IS GOTTEN BETTER

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:48.332
METRICS FOR TWO WEEKS BEFORE YOU

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:50.301
CAN AFFORD INTO THAT TEXTURES AT

00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:52.737
TIER -- AND THEN IT'S

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:53.904
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO POINT

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:55.373
OUT AND AS A FORMAL LOCAL HEALTH

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:56.607
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL MYSELF THE

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:57.708
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT STILL

00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:59.076
OF COURSE HAVE THE AUTHORITY

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:00.511
TO BE STRICTER THAN THE STATE

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:02.513
IF THEY CHOOSE TO SO WE HAVE

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.581
A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:05.049
ABOUT THE STATE CAN ALLOW AND IN

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:06.651
CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS MAY CHOOSE

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.119
TO BE STRICTER SO IT'S JUST

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:10.621
IMPORTANT FOR OUR CITIZENS ALL

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:13.124
SO ANOTHER COMMON QUESTION

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.059
IS ABOUT HOW DO WE DETERMINE

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.694
WHETHER SECTOR IS LOW MEDIUM

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:17.695
OR HIGH RISK AND WHAT ARE THE

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:19.030
PRINCIPLES THAT WE THINK ABOUT

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.998
WE DO THIS SO THE ABILITY TO

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:22.299
ACCOMMODATE FACE COVERINGS ARE

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:23.901
WEARING MASKS IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:25.369
SO THAT'S WHERE PLACES WHERE

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:26.737
PEOPLE ARE EATING OR DRINKING AS

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:28.072
A HIGHER REST BECAUSE YOU CANNOT

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.540
BE WEARING YOUR FACE COVERINGS

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:31.042
AVAILABILITY TO PHYSICALLY

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:32.443
DISTANCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.145
FROM DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS THE

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:35.246
ABILITY TO LIMIT THE NUMBER

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:36.447
OF PEOPLE PER SQUARE FOOT SO

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:37.682
AGAIN THE FOR THEIR PART PEOPLE

00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:39.850
AREN'T THE SAFER THE ABILITY TO

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:41.652
NUMBER ON THE WAY TO LIMIT THE

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:43.287
DURATION OF EXPOSURE SO LONGER

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:44.522
EXPOSURES ARE CERTAINLY HIGHER

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:46.557
RISKS OR EXPOSURES GOING TO

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:47.658
THE STORE BRIEFLY AND RUNNING

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:48.659
IN GETTING SOMETHING COMING

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:49.627
HOME IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.028
SITTING IN A TWO HOUR EVENT

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:53.831
AND THE ABILITY OF COURSE

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:55.199
ABOUT MIXING YOU WANT TO REALLY

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:56.834
MINIMIZE MIXING PEOPLE ACROSS

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:57.868
AND HOUSEHOLDS AND CERTAINLY

00:38:57.935 --> 00:38:59.203
ACROSS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.405
-- AND AGAIN REALLY INVENTED

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:03.107
LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.175
INTERACTIONS OF PEOPLE MIGHT

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.077
HAVE THAT ALL WITH OTHERS AND

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.478
THEN FINALLY SEVEN LEARNED AGAIN

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:08.479
MORE AND MORE OVER THE LAST

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:10.114
FEW MONTHS THAT THERE'S A MUCH

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:11.549
HIGHER RISK OF THIS VIRUS BEING

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:13.050
TRANSMITTED TO PEOPLE INDOORS

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:14.485
AND VENTILATION IS REALLY

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.820
IMPORTANT AND THAT IS WHY VERY

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.088
EARLY ON WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:18.422
FLIGHTS FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.757
IT'S MOSTLY OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:21.092
THAT ARE ALLOWED AND NOT

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:24.495
AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:26.330
REALLY INCREASE SPREAD OR

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:28.032
-- MAKE SPREAD GO FURTHER A

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:30.000
THINGS LIKE SINGING SHOUTING

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:31.102
HEAVY BREATHING SO WHEN YOU'RE

00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:33.070
EXERCISING -- AND THEN IF

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:34.171
YOU'RE IN ALLOWED ENVIRONMENT

00:39:34.238 --> 00:39:35.706
IT NEEDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:36.774
RAISING YOUR VOICE OR SHOUTING

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.109
WHICH AGAIN COULD PROPEL THE

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:39.877
DISEASE FURTHER AND IS HIGHER

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:42.012
RISK SETTING -- AND THEN

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:43.080
YOU'LL HEAR A LOT MORE ABOUT

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.348
THE THE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:45.416
BUT JUST BRIEFLY THE WAY IT

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:46.984
WORKS IS THERE ARE OVER EIGHTY

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.419
MANDATED REPORTABLE DISEASES

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:50.020
TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:51.922
BY CLINICIANS AND A SHORT

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:53.324
LIST OF THOSE RELAPSE AND CODE

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.992
NINETEEN CERTAINLY PART OF

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:56.327
A BOOK BY CLINICIANS AND LAB

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:57.762
SO WE RECEIVE THAT DATA AND A

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.330
COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS WE HAVE

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:01.132
ELECTRONIC LAB REPORTING NOW

00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:02.733
COMES IN TO RECOVER THE SYSTEM

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:04.301
WHICH MY COLLEAGUE WILL BE

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:05.936
EXPANDING FURTHER TO YOU AND

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:07.838
THEN THE -- CLINICIANS REPORT

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:09.373
CASES ALSO TO LOCAL DEPARTMENTS

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.641
AND THEY ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:11.909
THAT ALSO GOES TO OUR STATE

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:13.110
HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEN

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:15.079
WE JUST -- WE CALCULATE THOSE

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:16.213
ADJUSTED KEY STREETS AND TEST

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.282
POSITIVITY AS I WAS EXPLAINING

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:20.584
-- AND THEN ANOTHER COMMON

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:21.886
QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO COVER

00:40:21.952 --> 00:40:23.687
IS HOW DOES THIS AFFECT SCHOOLS

00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:25.523
SO WHEN WE TRANSITION TO THIS

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:27.558
BLUEPRINT WE WANTED TO MINIMIZE

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.026
ANY CHANGES WHAT WE'VE ALREADY

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.328
DECLARED ABOUT THE RE OPENING

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:33.130
OF SCHOOLS AND SO THE PURPLE

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:34.799
TEAR WAS BASICALLY VERY SIMILAR

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:37.101
TO THE -- THRESHOLDS FOR THE

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:38.502
COUNTY DATA MINING LIST SO THAT

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:40.738
WAS SORT OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:41.939
AND WE IT'S NOT ALREADY THAT

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:43.240
SCHOOLS COULD BE OPEN ONCE THEY

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.975
WERE TWO WEEKS OFF AT THE DATA

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:46.443
MODERN LIST SO THE EQUIVALENT

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.711
OF THAT IS ONCE THEY'RE IN THE

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.113
RED TERROR AND OUT OF THE PURPLE

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.447
TOUR FOR TWO WEEKS OR MORE

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:53.184
SCHOOLS TO RE OPEN SO THAT IS --

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.518
AS YOU CAN SEE ACROSS THE STATE

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:55.719
WHAT IS GRADUALLY HAPPENING AS

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.922
WELL ONE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN IN

00:40:57.988 --> 00:40:59.323
THE RED HERE IF THEY'RE COUNTY

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.858
WAS BACK INTO THE PURPLE TEAR IT

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:02.059
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THEY

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:03.928
NEED TO CLOSE I THINK THERE MAY

00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:05.329
BE INCREASED VIGILANCE OF COURSE

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.697
AND -- INCREASE POTENTIALLY

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.632
INCREASE TESTING -- IN THAT

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:10.501
SETTING BUT WE'VE RECOGNIZE THE

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:13.070
DESTRUCTION OF REAL OPENING AND

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.471
CLOSING AND WE REALLY WANT TO

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.307
MINIMIZE AGAIN AND SORT OF FLY

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:17.474
THERE SOMEBODY PRINCIPLES THAT

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:19.243
TAKING TIME FOR THERE'S MOVEMENT

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:20.845
SO THEY'RE NOT KIND OF HAVING

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.213
A WITH LACKS BETWEEN DIFFERENT

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:25.015
TIERS FINALLY THERE'S A COUNTY

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.584
DATA EDUCATION PROCESS WHICH

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.785
WE ARE FINALIZING WITH THE

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:28.686
WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL HEALTH

00:41:28.752 --> 00:41:30.554
DEPARTMENT PARTNERS ARE CAN HELP

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:32.056
EXECUTIVES GROUP AND OUR COUNTY

00:41:32.122 --> 00:41:33.824
HEALTH OFFICERS ORGANIZATION TO

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:35.492
DEVELOP AN ADJUDICATION PROCESS

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:37.294
OF THAT IF I COUNTY YOU KNOW

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:38.662
AND BACK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:39.930
IF THERE ARE ANY DISCREPANCIES

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:41.498
BETWEEN THE DATA AT THE LOCAL

BOARD SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT

00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:57.220
THE FIRST THING THEY -- YOU

00:55:57.287 --> 00:55:58.221
KNOW I GET A LOT OF WHETHER

00:55:58.288 --> 00:55:59.856
EVOLVING WITH THIS PANDEMIC AND

00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:02.125
-- SO THEY FIRST GET THEIR

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:03.193
TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR ACTUAL

00:56:03.259 --> 00:56:04.194
LABORATORY TESTING AND THEN

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.328
THEY REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE TO

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:06.362
REPORT TO US AND THEY'RE AND

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:07.630
THEY'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.466
DOING THAT BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:11.201
THAT CLINICIANS STILL ARE STILL

00:56:11.267 --> 00:56:12.802
SOMETIMES FAXING OR SOMETIMES

00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:14.571
LEADS ARE FAXING DATA IS TRUE

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:15.972
TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS SO

00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:17.073
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ON ALL

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.374
LEVELS DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS

00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:19.776
ARE WORKING ON IT BUT THE

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:21.044
CIRCLING BACK IN THIS DAY AND

00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:22.779
AGE OBVIOUSLY WITH THE NAVY

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.280
SHIP MERCY IN OUR CAREER HERE

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:26.683
IN SACRAMENTO THESE PAPER FILES

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.585
WITH ELECTRONIC TRACKING ABILITY

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:30.120
IT'S JUST MIND BOGGLING THAT

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.355
WE AREN'T USING ELECTRONIC

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:33.556
RECORDS OR SONY SYSTEMS OUT

00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:36.059
THERE OFF THE SHELF SYSTEMS --

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.661
IT JUST SEEMS VERY CUMBERSOME

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:40.797
TO HAVE A PAPER SYSTEM

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:44.067
HELLO WHY IS THAT WITH WITH

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:45.535
SO MANY ITEMS OR SOMEBODY

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:47.437
PROGRAMS AVAILABLE I

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:50.707
MEAN I THINK THAT'S A COMMON

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.375
QUESTION WE HELLER ARE WANTING

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:54.344
TO TO UPDATE OUR RESOURCES

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.713
COLLECTIVELY BUT I GUESS I'M

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.314
A PERSON ON THAT BECAUSE THERE

00:56:58.381 --> 00:56:59.816
ARE OFF THE SHELF SYSTEMS NOT

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:01.584
I MEAN IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:03.119
TO TO GET A SYSTEM LIKE THIS

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:05.155
TO DO ELECTRONICALLY SO -- WHY

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:07.290
HAVEN'T WE DONE THAT YEAH IT'S

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:09.993
REALLY CONNECTING THOSE ON THE

00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:12.028
HOSPITAL LABS OR OTHER SYSTEMS

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.696
AND COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN

00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:15.999
PLEASE YEAH KINSMEN LABORATORY

00:57:16.065 --> 00:57:17.667
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:20.336
SO IT'S THE I. T. CONNECTIVITY

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:21.604
TO THOSE SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE

00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:22.806
WORKING ON AND I THINK OUR

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:24.841
NEW SYSTEM THE C. C. R. AS

00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:26.176
SYSTEM THAT WE'RE BUILDING WILL

00:57:26.242 --> 00:57:27.744
PROVIDE AN EASIER WAY AFTER

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:29.112
A LOT FOR -- SOME OF THESE

00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:31.147
HOSPITALS AND LABS TO CONNECT

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:32.849
INTO THE SYSTEM SO WE ARE AWARE

00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:33.950
OF THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:35.418
IT AS WELL AND WORKING WITH

00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:37.320
PROVIDERS TO GET THEM AS QUICKLY

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:38.855
ON TO THE SYSTEM AS WE CAN

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:41.324
SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE YOU KNOW

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:43.560
SEVEN MONTHS INTO THIS -- THE

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:44.961
NAVY SHIP IS GONE ALLEN ARE

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:47.630
KOREANS NOT BEING USED SO HOW

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:50.166
FAR AWAY ARE WE FROM -- BRINGING

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:51.534
THE TRUCK FILES ON BOARD

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:54.270
I THINK FOR THE MOST PART WE

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:55.705
DO HAVE A LOT TRAINING FILES

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:57.774
IT'S AS NEW LABS ARE NEW HEALTH

00:57:57.841 --> 00:57:59.809
CARE -- COMES ON BOARD THAT WE

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.277
HAVE TO GET THEM CONNECTED AND

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:02.412
SO WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:03.947
SYSTEM WE THINK IT'LL BE MUCH

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.782
EASIER WITH AND I'LL HAVE I HAVE

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:07.517
R. I. T. FOLKS TALK TO IT BUT

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:09.786
ONE OF THE BENEFITS TO THE C. C.

00:58:09.853 --> 00:58:11.287
R. S. SYSTEM WILL BE AN EASIER

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:12.856
WAY TO GET IN SOME OF THESE

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:15.225
-- ELECTRONIC FILES BUT BUT

00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:16.459
NO TIMELINE RIGHT NOW THE

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:20.129
I'M NOT DEFERRED HER I. T. FOLKS

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:21.798
TO ANSWER THAT TIMELINE ON THE

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:26.870
RAUNER KERRY

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:36.880
THANK YOU MEMBERS APPROPRIATE

00:58:36.946 --> 00:58:39.716
QUESTION D. TRONIC

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:42.418
ABILITY FOR THOSE LAPS OR

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:44.087
PROVIDERS THAT HAVE ELECTRONIC

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:45.688
SYSTEMS TO SUBMIT THOSE TO

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:47.457
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:49.859
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND WHEN THE

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:52.562
ONE OFF CONTRACTS ARE

00:58:52.629 --> 00:58:55.632
USED TO EXPAND ON THAT TESTING

00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:57.634
DONE IN THE STATE THAT SAME

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.968
MANDATORY REQUIREMENT THAT

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.803
THEY SUBMIT INTO THE STATEWIDE

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:03.339
ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SYSTEM

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:06.643
SO THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:08.845
THAT ARE USING THIS AT ONE OP

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:10.480
TESTING FACILITIES THAT'S THAT'S

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:13.583
THEIR OPTION TO UTILIZE

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:15.685
NON ELECTRONIC RECORDS BUT BUT

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:16.953
OTHER STATES HAVE FOUND WAYS TO

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.154
HAVE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:20.323
IN MAKESHIFT HOSPITALS SO I'M

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:21.424
I'M WONDERING IF OTHER STATES

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:23.826
ARE DOING THAT -- A NEW PUBLIC

00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:26.429
HEALTH IS A ROBUST IT SYSTEM

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:29.465
-- I FROM WE ARE DOING THAT

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:31.634
IF OTHER STATES CAN DO IT

00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:40.143
SORRY ARE YOU ASKING

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:40.977
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:42.912
TEMPORARY HOSPITALS CORRECT

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:46.416
-- WILL AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:49.085
HAVE NOT NOT

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:51.321
ONLY THAT SECONDARY WILL LOOK

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.890
INTO THAT WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR --

00:59:54.223 --> 00:59:56.526
AND WILL I THINK THAT I COULD DO

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:58.561
THE QUESTION AGAIN OUR MAKESHIFT

00:59:58.628 --> 00:59:59.862
HOSPITAL FACILITY SHARING

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.230
AND TRACKING TEST RESULTS

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.233
OKAY SO YOU'RE RIGHT YEAH I

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.435
MEAN YOU'RE CORRECT WE HAVE BEEN

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.437
USING AND A FEW HOSPITALS THAT

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.973
WE SET UP IN MAKESHIFT WAY I'M

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.374
SO WE'LL TAKE THAT BACK AS A

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.176
CONSIDERATION AND EXPLORE WHAT

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.844
SOME OTHER OPTIONS ARE FOR THOSE

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:17.680
ARCO ARENA TYPE -- SITUATION

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:19.182
SORRY WE WERE ADDRESSING THE

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:20.216
BIGGER QUESTION WITH SOME OF

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.884
THE LABS AS THEY COME ON BOARD

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.653
AND GETTING THEM INTO THE LOCK

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.421
PRODUCTS SYSTEM UNDERSTUDY

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:26.923
MAKESHIFT AND OBVIOUSLY OTHER

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.890
STATES ARE DOING IT RIGHT NOW

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.058
WITH MAKESHIFT WERE SELECT

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.626
WHAT EXETER IF WE DO THAT THAT

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:32.795
WOULD BE GREAT OKAY WE'LL

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.297
TAKE THAT BACK AND I THINK YOU

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:37.867
THANK YOU MR FONG

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.005
I THINK THIS CHAIR THIS QUESTION

01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:43.973
MADE THE FOR SUSAN OR FOR DR

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.575
PAM BUT IS IT CORRECT TO SAY

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.744
THAT THE THE PATH FOR COUNTIES

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.045
AND CITIES TO MOVE THROUGH THE

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:50.346
BLUEPRINT FROM TIER TO TIER

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:51.714
IS BASED ON THE INFORMATION

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:52.915
COLLECTED IN THE CAR READY

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.385
SYSTEM A WEEK IS THAT IS

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.387
THAT IS THAT THE BASIS OF

01:00:57.453 --> 01:01:00.023
THE DATA THAT IS CORRECT

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.724
AND THAT DOT ALONG WITH ANY

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.259
ADJUDICATION AND ANY WORK

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.293
THAT WE DO WITH OUR LOCAL

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.661
JURISDICTIONS IF THEY BELIEVE

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:07.430
THEY HAVE DATA THAT IS NOT WELL

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.865
REFLECTED AND CAL READY SO WE

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.867
HAVE AS ERICA DESCRIBE WE HAVE

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:13.069
AT AND EDUCATION PROCESS WE HAVE

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.704
YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS AND

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:15.705
THERE ARE A COUPLE COUNTIES IN

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:17.507
THE STATE THAT DON'T USE THE CAL

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:18.975
READY SYSTEM IN THE SAME WAY I'M

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.576
SO WE WORK WITH UP ON BOTH SAN

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:23.146
DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES SO THEN

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:25.381
GIVE IT SO THEN IS CAL READY

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.617
SUPPOSED TO OPERATE IN REAL TIME

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.853
AS IF IF THE IF THE BLUEPRINT

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.322
IS IS IS BASED ON THE DATA

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:34.724
SYSTEMS OR THE DATA PROVIDING

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:35.858
THE COVERAGE SYSTEM IS CAL

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:36.993
READY SUPPOSED TO BE OPERATING

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.228
IN A REAL TIME BASIS I THINK

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.997
AS CLOSE TO REAL TIME AS WE CAN

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.365
GET IT UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:44.100
ARE LAGS IN TERMS OF LABORATORY

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.768
PURPORTING INTO ANY AND SO

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:47.370
WHAT WE USE IN THE BLUEPRINT

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:49.705
AS THAT SEVEN DAY LAG BECAUSE

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:51.374
WE KNOW AS CASES ARE REPORTED

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.909
THEY GET BANNED I TOOK IT BACK

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:55.211
TO THE CORRECT DATE -- AND

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:56.913
SO WE USE THAT SEVEN DAY LAG TO

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.481
BE AS CLOSE TO REAL TIME WITH

01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.916
ACCURATE INFORMATION AS WE CAN

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.351
BE OKAY THEN I GUESS GOING BACK

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:04.420
TO THE JULY TWENTY FIFTH -- I

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:05.655
AND I THINK IT'S KIND OF GLOSSED

01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:08.157
OVER BUT MY UNDERSTANDING AND

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.026
CORRECT ME IF I GIVE MY IF MY

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:11.894
UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENED IS

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.397
INCORRECT BUT THAT THE SYSTEM TO

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.799
CARRY SYSTEM WAS NOT DESIGNED TO

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:18.167
HANDLE THE VOLUME OF DATA AS YOU

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.703
INDICATED AND SO THROUGH SOME

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.106
CHECK IT WAS SEEN THAT THE

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.574
CAVITY SYSTEM WASN'T OPERATING

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.509
AT FULL CAPACITY IN WHICH CASE

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:27.977
THE SYSTEM WAS SHUT DOWN IS THAT

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:30.446
CORRECT AND THEN I

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.950
I'M NOT SCARED TO INSPECT THE

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:36.586
SYSTEM DID GAP GO DOWN ON JULY

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.788
TWENTY FIFTH AND WAS LATER

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.022
BROUGHT BACK UP IN AUGUST

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.258
GARY TO SPEAK TO THE SPECIFICS

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:43.726
OF WHY THE SYSTEM WENT DOWN

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.999
-- THIS IS A VERY NOTING CHAU

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:52.068
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH -- SO IT

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:53.369
WAS SORT OF A COMBINATION OF

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.738
EVENTS THAT HAPPEN -- WITH A

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:57.173
LARGE VOLUME MESSAGES COMING

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.809
INTO THE FRONT END OF OUR --

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:02.178
-- GATEWAY -- WE NOTICED THERE

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:03.813
WAS A LARGE VOLUMES AND A LOT

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.581
OF DUPLICATES AT THAT WERE

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:07.216
FLOWING THROUGH TO THE CARRY

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.819
SYSTEM -- THAT CAUSE PROBLEMS

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:10.987
WITHIN THE CAO READY SYSTEM

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:13.156
IN A STARTED TO BACK UP SO

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:15.591
WE OKAY SO I WILL GO AGAIN

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:16.993
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH OUT BUT IT

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.828
YET THESE DUPLICATE MESSAGES

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.363
BECAUSE SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:24.267
OKAY SO THEN ONCE YOU DISCOVERED

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.169
THE THE THE GLITCH I GUESS

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:27.236
IS WHAT WE'RE IT WAS BEING

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:29.539
REFERRED TO THEN THE SYSTEM WAS

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:31.974
TAKEN DOWN OR TO ADDRESS A

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.442
DUPLICATION OR WAS IT AS A

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:34.844
SYSTEM WAS BROUGHT BACK ON

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:37.046
AFTER THE GLITCH WAS WAS ADDRESS

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.115
THEN THE DUPLICATIONS BECAME A

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:40.483
PROBLEM IN WHICH CASE THAT HAD

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.851
TO BE ADDRESSED IS THAT CORRECT

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.819
YES YES WE STARTED DRESS IT

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:45.388
AT THE AT THE GATEWAY WHICH IS

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.890
IN FRONT OF HOW READY AND --

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:49.625
WE MADE SOME CHANGES TO REDUCE

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:51.394
THE DUPLICATION WHICH AT SIDE

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.096
EFFECTS THEMSELVES AND THEN --

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:55.264
THAT CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH THE

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:56.365
GATEWAY AND THEN WE STARTED

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.334
WORKING ON HOW COULD WE FIX

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:00.536
THOSE PROBLEMS SEVERAL EIGHT

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.038
SO THAT THOSE ARE THE TEMPORARY

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:03.573
FIX THAT WAS USED TO ADDRESS

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:04.674
IT TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.108
ENDED UP SLOWING DOWN THE SYSTEM

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:07.843
AND SAID THAT TEMPORARY FIX WAS

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.745
REMOVED TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.247
AND THEN TO DUPLICATION PROCESS

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:13.783
WAS REINSTALLED IS ACTUALLY

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.919
YES YEAH RIGHT BACK TO WHERE IT

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:19.055
WAS ORIGINALLY AND THEN WE PULL

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.690
SOME OF THOSE DUPLICATE MESSAGES

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.091
OFF FROM BEING PROCESSED AND

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:24.427
I DO MAINLY PROCESS THEM AND

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:25.661
-- THAT DELAYED SOME OF THE

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:26.862
MESSAGES GETTING IN THE CAR

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:29.098
READY SO UNDERSTANDING NOW

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:30.166
THAT WE'RE ALL OPERATING ON

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:32.501
THE SAME LIKE SCENARIO WHAT

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.470
HAPPENED THEN I GUESS WHAT

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.505
WAS THEN TAKEN WHAT ACTIONS

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:38.407
WERE THEN TAKEN TO TO FIX THIS

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:39.609
BECAUSE IS IT IS IT IS THERE

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:40.376
A LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS WILL

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.745
HAPPEN AGAIN -- WHAT WHAT

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.013
VERY WHAT WAS DONE TO PREVENT

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.948
THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN SO A

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:48.784
NUMBER OF THINGS -- WE'RE DONE

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.653
-- TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.189
AGAIN AND -- WE STARTED THOSE

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:54.590
IN EARLY AUGUST LATE JULY

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.425
EARLY AUGUST AND WE STARTED

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:57.627
-- WE BROUGHT DEPARTMENT OF

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:59.095
TECHNOLOGY AND YOU HEARD RUN

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:01.831
ROBINETTE WE PUT -- -- TIGER

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:03.232
TEAMS TOGETHER TO WORK TWENTY

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:05.067
FOUR HOURS A DAY WE LOOKED AT

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:07.837
STABILIZING BOTH THE HIV GATEWAY

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:09.672
PROCESSING THE MESSAGES AND

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.607
IMPROVING THE THE RELIABILITY

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:13.509
OF THAT SYSTEM BY ADDING MORE

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.378
HARDWARE -- IMPROVING THE

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.046
PERFORMANCE BRINGING THE BAND

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:18.514
MORE VENDORS ON BOARD THAT

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.549
HAD MORE SKILLS AND WE HAD TO

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:21.984
ACTUALLY CONFIGURE THE SYSTEM

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:25.221
APPROPRIATELY -- -- TO HANDLE

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:26.722
THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD WHICH

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:28.157
WAS SIGNIFICANT FROM WHAT IT'S

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:30.159
BEEN OVER THE LAST YEARS OF

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:31.927
THAT HAD A DOWNSTREAM IMPACT

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:34.697
ON HOW READY IT MADE IT EASIER

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.966
FOR CARRIED A PROCESS REAL

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:38.768
MESSAGES BUT HE WITH THE

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:40.403
INCREASING VOLUME CAL READY

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.338
WAS STILL HAVING A BACKLOG IN

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:44.640
REAL MESSAGES WE SPENT A NUMBER

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:47.043
OF THE SAME TEAM FOCUSED ON

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:49.078
IMPROVEMENTS TO CAL READY --

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.147
AS RON ROBINETTE SAID FROM C.

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.249
T. WE FOUND SOME PERFORMANCE

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:54.317
ENHANCEMENTS IN THE SEQUEL

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:56.252
DATABASE WHICH INCREASE THE

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.953
PERFORMANCE ALMOST SIX TIMES

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:00.423
SO -- WE'VE IMPROVED THE

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:01.724
CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.093
WE'VE M. PROVED BRINGING MORE

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.428
SKILL SETS ON BALL FROM THE

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:08.164
VENDORS -- EAF --

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.233
WE'VE ADDED MORE SIGNIFICANT

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.003
-- HARDWARE AND -- -- UPGRADES

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:16.238
AND STUFF THIS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.908
STABILIZE THE SYSTEM -- AS OF

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.776
WITHIN THE LAST PROBABLY SIX

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:22.011
WEEKS WE'VE HAD NO ONE PLANNED

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:24.246
DOWNTIME AND WE HAVE ZERO

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:26.515
BACKLOGS DAY IN AND DAY OUT ON

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:29.185
CAL READY -- WE HAVE OUR LEAD

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:31.954
MESSAGE DID JUST --

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:34.690
-- STATUS UP OF THE FIFTEEN

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.258
JEWS COMING IN THE CAR READY

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:37.727
NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.428
TIME THEY'RE ZERO AND WE ARE

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.797
PREFERRED FOR A PER PROCESSING

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.766
-- MORE MESSAGES IN CARRY THAN

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.101
WE EVER HAVE PROBABLY EIGHTY

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.403
THOUSAND AND THAT CONTINUES TO

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:49.238
GROW AS THE VOLUME GROWTH THE

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.307
FRONT IN HIV GATEWAY SYSTEM

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.242
HAS PROP -- WITH IMPROVEMENTS

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.177
WE'VE MADE TO THAT HAS --

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.814
AS SHE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:01.317
-- AND ABLE TO PROCESS MORE

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:03.219
MESSAGES WE'VE EVEN HAD IN

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:04.253
THE RANGE OF TWO TO THREE

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.888
HUNDRED A DAY TWO OR THREE

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.590
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND WE'VE

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:09.191
HAD NO GLITCHES IN THE SYSTEM

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:10.259
SO ALL IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:11.494
WE HAVE MADE ON THE CURRENT

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.529
ENVIRONMENT -- HAVE PROVED TO

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:16.265
BE VERY STABILIZING AND --

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:18.768
AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:20.236
MONITOR AND STAY AHEAD OF THE

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:22.738
GAME AND AND YOU'D INDICATED

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.073
THAT THE THAT THE SYSTEM

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.375
IS TESTED EACH DAY OR DALY

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.445
WHAT WE DO EACH DAY IF

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:31.781
WE HAVE A SEPARATE -- --

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:34.016
-- REPORTING SYSTEM THAT LOOKS

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.551
AT ALL THE MESSAGES -- THIS

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:36.919
INDEPENDENT RUN BY THE PART

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.621
OF TECHNOLOGY AND GIVES US

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:40.856
THE TOTAL COUNTS OF MESSAGES

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:42.658
COMING IN AND THEN IN OUR IN

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:44.627
OUR SYSTEMS THE THE GATEWAY

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:47.363
COUNTS ALL THOSE MESSAGES AND

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.165
AND WE RELATE BACK TO THIS

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.866
INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS AND AS

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:52.735
THEY GO INTO CAL READY TO BE

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:55.838
PROCESS WE ALSO COMPARED NUMBERS

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.406
AND METRICS EVERY SINGLE DAY

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:58.774
WE ALSO COMPARE METRICS WITH

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:01.377
LA AND SAN DIEGO AND SO IF

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:02.745
THERE ARE ANY DISCREPANCIES

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:04.413
FOR ANY REASON WE IMMEDIATELY

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.015
IDENTIFY WHERE THEY ARE AND

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:07.316
WE'RE ABLE TO WORK ON VERY

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:09.618
QUICKLY TO RESOLVE THEM OKAY

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:11.320
AND AND THEN I GUESS MAYBE YOU

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:13.589
OR DOCTOR BANNER OUR DEMOCRACY

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:15.157
PH HOW DOES THAT SO I'VE I'VE

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:16.725
KIND OF HEARD THREE SYSTEMS AS

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.227
THE EXISTING CAR READY SYSTEM

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.062
THERE'S IS NAY C. C. R. S.

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:22.531
SYSTEM AND THEN THERE IS A

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.433
NEED FOR A A. B. A NEW CAR

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.869
READY SYSTEM IN THERE -- SO

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.537
HOW DO THEY ALL HAD AT LEAST

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:29.772
MY FIRST QUESTION IS HOW DOES

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.040
THE EXISTING COVERAGE SYSTEM

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.775
AND THIS NEW C. C. R. S. SYSTEM

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.076
HOW DO THEY INTERACT WITH EACH

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:36.579
OTHER YOU COULD HAVE

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.147
ORDERED THE OTHER TWO SYSTEMS

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:40.483
OR WIND JUST FOR CALL OF IT

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:42.284
AND THE OTHER ONES FOR TWELVE

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:43.552
AND PLUS EVERYTHING ELSE

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:47.156
NO THIS IS YOUR SYSTEM WAS

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:50.559
CREATED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.661
OF THE ELECTRONIC LAB RECORDS

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:55.064
COMING IN -- OFTEN HAS A LOT OF

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.932
SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:59.802
SO ULTIMATELY THE NEW SYSTEMC

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:01.403
HARASSED WILL PROCESS ALL

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.138
THE INCOMING MESSAGES AND WE

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:04.340
EXPECT THEM TO GO TO THREE

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:05.341
OR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND A

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:08.010
DAY TO REMOVE THE DUPES

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:09.879
CHECK FOR QUALITY ENHANCE THE

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.981
QUALITY OF THE MESSAGE AND

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:14.416
AND THEN SEND THAT GOOD QUALITY

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:17.152
MESSAGES ON TO OUR HIV GATEWAY

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:18.521
AND THEN WE WILL ROUTE THEM

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.389
THROUGH OUT HOW READY LA AND

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:22.825
SAN DIEGO -- SO THAT OFFLOAD

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.094
SOME OF THE -- LAB PROCESSING

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.062
OFF OF OUR H. I. GATEWAY THE

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:29.298
SECOND SIGNIFICANT PART OF C.

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:31.467
C. R. S. IS THE COLBERT REPORT

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.302
THAT IS SPECIFIC TO COPE WITH

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:34.803
AND THAT IN ITSELF BUILDING

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:37.673
A REPORTING SYSTEM WILL ALLOW

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.708
THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:41.710
DALY PROVIDE THE GOVERNORSHIP

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:43.312
-- METRICS FOR THE DASHBOARD

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.948
AND -- IN A MUCH SHORTER TIME

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.784
AND A MORE RELIABLE -- BEFORE

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.319
THEIR WORK THEY HAD TO CONSUME

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.721
EVERY DAY LOTS OF DATA -- THAT

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.290
WAS GROWING EVERY DAY THIS WILL

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:56.125
PUT IT ALL INTO ONE REPORTING

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.227
DATABASE AND THEY SHOULD BE MORE

01:09:58.294 --> 01:09:59.528
EFFICIENT AT GENERATING THOSE

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:02.264
METRICS SO THEN THE THE WAY

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.667
THE PROCESS IS NOW OR AT LEAST

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.235
WE ARE NOT NOW BUT WHEN THIS

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:07.469

ALL THE RESULTS BEING COLLECTED

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:14.777
IN THE STATE THAT WOULD BE SENT

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:16.512
TO THE C. C. R. S. SYSTEM FIRST

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.514
AND THEN THAT WILL BE REVIEWED

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.049
AND THEN IT WOULD BE THEN SENT

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:22.351
TO THE CAL READY SYSTEM FOR THAT

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:24.920
TO BE UP LOADED -- FOR EVERYONE

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:27.256
TO ACCESS THAT THAT'S

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:29.525
CORRECT -- IT TOO WE HAVE OVER

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:31.260

DIRECTLY INTO THE CDPH GATEWAY

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:37.232
AND THOSE OVER TIME MONTHS

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:39.368
WILL SLOWLY BE MOVED ON TO THE

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:40.769
OPTIM SYSTEM TO SEE IF YOUR

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:42.871
SYSTEM AND THAT WILL OFF LOADED

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:44.673
AND IT WILL BE DIRECTLY HE TO

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.109
THEM NOW WITH WHAT THE NEW

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:49.612
CAR READY SYSTEM BE CREATED OFF

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:51.947
THE FOUNDATION OF THE CRS OR

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:53.048
IS IT OR THEY'RE GOING TO ARE

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.350
YOU GUYS GOING TO CREATE A BRAND

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.585
NEW CAR READY UP ON ITS OWN

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:59.521
SO -- -- SO IT'S MORE A DISEASE

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:01.190
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ANSWER

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:03.726
SURVEILLANCE AND -- WE WE

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:04.893
ARE WORKING WITH A CONTRACTOR

MAP FOR A COUPLE YEARS OUT --

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:11.867
THERE ARE INTERVIEWING MANY

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.937
STAKEHOLDERS -- COUNTIES CDPH

01:11:15.004 --> 01:11:17.406
AGENCY CDT TO SEE WHAT THEIR

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:18.807
VISIONS ARE THEY'RE LOOKING

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:20.676
AT NEWER TECHNOLOGIES THEY

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:22.277
ARE LOOKING AT OTHER STATES

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:23.445
AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:24.413
WHAT THEIR PLANS ARE FOR

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.682
THE FUTURE OF LOOKING AT --

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.818
CDC FOR ANY ANY IDEAS AND

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:31.387
SYSTEMS THEY HAVE SO WE'RE

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.656
JUST AT THE EARLY STAGES OF OF

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.958
-- OF LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:37.559
AND WHAT TYPE OF SYSTEM WOULD

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:39.795
BE SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FUTURE

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.231
INCLUDING PROBABLY THE LOCAL

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:43.699
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS A LOT

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:45.601
BECAUSE THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY THE

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.202
FRONTLINE AND A LOT OF THIS

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:49.538
AND -- THEY HAVE THEIR OWN

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:52.274
-- SORT OF ON PREMISE SYSTEMS

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:54.243
THAT THEY HAVE TO SUPPORT --

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.744
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.346
WE ARE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.781
WITH THEM OKAY BUT THE GOAL IS

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.649
COMPATIBILITY THOUGH RIGHT YOU

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:01.884
WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE MULTIPLE

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:02.818
SYSTEMS THAT DON'T TALK TO

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:05.154
EACH OTHER NOW WE HAVE

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.056
TO INTER OPERABILITY IS EXACTLY

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.157
WHAT WE ARE TODAY EVERYTHING

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:10.459
WE BUILD TODAY THEY THE CONTACT

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:11.994
TRACING SYSTEM INTEROPERATES

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.729
WITH CAL READY AND IT WILL

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.631
INTEROPERATE WITH OTHER SYSTEMS

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:17.800
-- THAT REQUIRE THE CONTACT

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:20.402
TRACING DATA -- AND CAL

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.371
READY AS INTER OPERATING THAT

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.506
WAY ALSO THE NEW CCRI SYSTEM

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.442
INTEROPERATES WITH OUR GATEWAY

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.343
SO EVERYTHING THAT WE LOOK AT

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:30.512
TODAY IS REALLY CONNECTED IN

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:32.047
MY OR ANOTHER AND WE'RE USING

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:34.083
INTER OPERABILITY SOFTWARE TO

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.518
MAKE IT EASIER AND FASTER TO

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.787
DELIVER THOSE OKAY AND AFTER

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:40.422
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY BIG I

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:41.390
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ATTENTION

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:43.425
ON CAL READY AND ON THIS NEWS

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.793
THE SEWER SYSTEM BUT HOW MANY

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.628
DATABASES DOES THE CALIFORNIA

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:47.896
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAVE

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:52.468
SHE WE HAVE OVER TWO

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.536
HUNDRED APPLICATIONS WE PROBABLY

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:56.939
HAVE -- YOU KNOW HUNDREDS

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.540
OF DATABASES FROM ACCESS TO

01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:01.009
SEQUEL TO ORACLE -- WE HAVE

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:02.778
VERY LARGE DATABASES DRIVING

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:04.680
OUR LARGE SYSTEMS AND THEN

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.081
WE HAVE SMALLER DATABASES

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:07.649
FOR SOME OF THE PROGRAM AREAS

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:09.918
OKAY SO I GUESS I ME I JUST

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.286
HAVE A NUMBER BUT A FEW MORE

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:12.087
QUESTIONS AT LEAST ON THE

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:14.189
CALVET -- THE CAR READY SYSTEM

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.491
SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:17.059
THE HELP DESK WHICH THE USERS

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:19.995
AND PROVIDERS -- UTILIZE

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:22.331
-- THAT THE HELP DESK WAS SHUT

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:24.299
DOWN -- THEY SAID ON ITS PHONE

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:26.168
SERVICE AND MOVED TO AN EMAIL

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:27.269
ONLY SERVICE AND I I'VE HEARD

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:28.270
THIS FROM MY OWN DEPARTMENT

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.038
PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE OF THIS

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:31.740
RESPONSES TO TIME SENSITIVE

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:33.642
ISSUES ARE RELATIVELY SLOW

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:36.712
-- GOOD CD B. H. R. COULD YOU

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:38.213
COMMENT ON THAT AND ARE YOU

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.548
WORKING TO INCREASE RESPONSE

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:41.450
TIMES TO THE HELP DESK --

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:43.552
ESPECIALLY WHEN AS IT INDICATED

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.721
EARLIER WE NEED AS REAL TIME

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.122
AS POSSIBLE AND AS THE DATA

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.324
IS SO IMPORTANT -- KICKED THE

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:50.559
CAN YOU COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.462
CHAU AYE I CAN'T ADDRESS THAT

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:54.630
I CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO IT

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:56.532
I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY CARRY

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.467
PROGRAM IT'S PROBABLY THEIR

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.602
HELP DESK NOT AN I. T. HELP DESK

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:03.038
-- -- THAT THEY WERE MAKING NO

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:05.541
CHANGES BUT -- I CERTAINLY CAN

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.509
LOOK INTO IT AND SEE YOU KNOW

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:09.378
WHY THAT WAS HAPPENING OKAY AND

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:10.479
AS A FOLLOW UP THEM AND MAYBE

01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:12.247
IT'S POSSIBLE TO GIVE LIMITED A

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.449
MINUTE AT ADMIN RIGHTS TO TO

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.151
THE COVERAGE SYSTEM TO SPECIFIC

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:18.020
INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COUNTY

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:19.488
LEVEL WITHIN CAL WITH WITH WITH

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:21.256
IN EACH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:22.925
HEALTH AGENCIES COUNTY SO THAT

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:25.427
THERE'S SOME RESEARCH THAT SO

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:26.528
THAT THEY CAN HAVE SOME ACCESS

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:27.696
TO THEY CAN ACTUALLY UPLOAD

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.765
THE DATA QUICKER MAYBE THAT

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:30.866
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN LOOK INTO

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:35.070
SIX YES AN ENHANCED PRIVILEGES

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:36.505
TO HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO DATA

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:39.107
WITHIN WITHIN THE CARRY DATA

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:40.275
WAREHOUSE SO WE HAVE A DATA

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:41.476
WAREHOUSE EVERY DAY THAT WE

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:43.011
POPULATE WITH THE CURRENT DATA

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:44.847
AND THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL THE

01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:46.815
COUNTIES THROUGH ARE A WEB BASED

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:49.585
INTERFACE -- AND -- WE

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.186
ARE LOOKING AT MAKING HIM THAT

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:52.955
IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT THAT THAT

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:54.289
IS NOT JUST GO WITH THAT SCHOOL

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:56.558
THAT IN EVERYTHING SO I WILL

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:59.494
LOOK AT WHAT THAT REQUIRE SEE

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.064
SEE WHAT IT WHAT WHAT IT

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.432
WHAT ENHANCE PRIVILEGES WILL

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:05.334
OFFERS THE COUNTY SAN ACCESS

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.236
TO THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:08.437
AND THEN OF COURSE EVEN PRIOR

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:09.605
TO THE DATE A GLITCH CAL READY

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:11.273
PRESENTED AND STILL DOES PRESENT

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.507
SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:14.443
TERMS OF I RECEIVED REPORTS OF

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:15.644
COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:16.645
AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:18.313
DEALING WITH SIGNIFICANT DELAYS

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.715
IN REGISTERING NEW USERS AND

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.683
PROVIDERS TO HAVE READY WITH

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.085
SOME PROVIDERS WAITING WEEKS TO

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.620
HAVE THEIR REGISTRATION APPROVED

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:26.321
-- WHICH IS CLEARLY PROBLEMATIC

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:27.723
AS AS AT ANY COULD BEFORE WE

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:28.824
DON'T WANT ANY DELAYS IN THE

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.959
DATA -- IS THERE A PLAN IN

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.261
PLACE TO MAKE THE REGISTRATION

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:34.296
PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT -- OR

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.464
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:40.502
I OTHER TEAM

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:42.037
AND SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:43.639
AT THAT BUT WE WE HAVE TRIED

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.107
TO INCREASE THAT PROTECT THE

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:47.109
RESPONSE TIME AND SO WE DID

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.077
PUT A TEAM OF PEOPLE -- WHO ARE

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:50.412
WORKING ON THAT TO TRY TO GET

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:52.147
MORE TIMELY RESPONSES BACK TO

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:53.448
PEOPLE BUT WILL DOUBLE CHECK

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:55.350
ON THAT AND WE'LL ALSO LOOK AT

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:58.053
WHETHER WE CAN RESTORE ON THAT

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.688
PHONE LINE IN ADDITION TO THE

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:01.990
EMAIL ACCOUNT OKAY DEBBIE I

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:02.758
THINK THEY'LL BE VERY HELPFUL

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:03.959
ESPECIALLY AS WE NEED MORE

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.360
TIMELY INFORMATION -- AND THEN

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.729
OF COURSE SUCH A MEDIC

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:09.464
ALREADY USERS -- ARE FRUSTRATED

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:10.532
SOME OF THE SYSTEMS LESS THAN

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.601
USER FRIENDLY FEATURES --

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:14.102
DIFFICULT IS SURGING MORE THAN

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:16.571
ONE SINGLE DEMOGRAPHIC -- STOP

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:18.240
POSSIBLE SEARCH MULTIPLE FIELDS

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.342
OR TO QUICKLY FILTER A SEARCH BY

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.678
OTHER FIELDS -- AND OTHER

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:23.879
PARTS OF THE DATA DISTRIBUTION

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:25.847
PORTALS ARE IN TERMS OF THE

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.282
USE OF FLAT FILES MAKES DATA

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.084
PROCESSING MORE DIFFICULT --

01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:30.285
ARE THOSE TEACHERS GOING TO BE

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:33.155
ADDRESSED -- MOVING FORWARD --

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:34.122
IS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.190
BE ADDRESSED IN THE C. SIERRA

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:38.093
SYSTEM OR WERE IN THE EXISTING

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.495
PROPERTY SYSTEM MANY OF

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:41.863
THOSE FEATURES WILL BE ADDRESSED

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:42.965
IN THE BUILDING OF THE NEW

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.466
SYSTEM ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:45.901
WE'RE DOING EXTENSIVE USER

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:47.536
OUTREACH IS TO GET OUT THOSE

01:16:47.602 --> 01:16:48.971
ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:50.939
BUILD THE SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:52.908
THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE -- VERY

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.810
MEANINGFUL REQUEST FROM OUR

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.845
LOCAL PARTNERS AND PROVIDERS

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.849
OKAY BUT I GUESS IN TERMS OF

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.217
-- I GUESS IF YOU COULD ADDRESS

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:03.819
THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AS

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:06.321
WELL AS -- GIVING SOME LIMITED

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:07.789
ADMIN ACCESS THAT WOULD BE

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.358
EXTREMELY HELPFUL I THINK TO THE

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:10.993
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.763
TO THE I GUESS MAYBE THIS

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.498
QUESTIONS REGARD FOR DR PAN AM

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:17.799
I GUESS MOVING TO THE BLUEPRINT

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:20.869
AND -- CAN CAN CAN YOU

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:23.071
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THE HOSPITAL

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:25.807
CAPACITY METRIC WAS REMOVED

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:27.275
FROM THE BLUEPRINT AND WHAT

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:28.677
WAS THE BASIS FOR THAT DECISION

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:31.046
SURE YEAH I KNOW IT'S A GREAT

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.881
QUESTION THANK YOU YET --

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:34.883
SO WE REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.151
ON LEADING INDICATORS RIGHT

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:37.119
ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE THINKING

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:38.353
ABOUT THE FOCUS OF THE BOOK

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:40.756
WAS A SLOW INTERNET RE OPENING

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:42.257
-- BUT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.191
STILL WATCHING ALL OF THE

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:44.393
HOSPITAL AFTER EXPECTING

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:46.728
AND THAT WAS WHY WE HAD A

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:49.931
A PRESS EVENT ON FRIDAY TO

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.133
REALLY TELL EVERYONE THAT WE

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:52.401
ARE SEEING THIS PLATEAUING

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:53.702
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND IN FACT IF

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:54.870
YOU REGION MAYBE A LITTLE BIT

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:56.438
AN UPTICK WE WATCH THE PERCENT

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.073
OF ICE YOU CLASSES EVERY DAY

01:17:58.373 --> 01:17:59.908
WE ARE SO LONG AS CLOSELY AS

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:01.076
ARE THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:02.411
BUT WE REALLY FOR THE BLUEPRINT

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:03.979
WANTED TO TRY TO SIMPLIFY THINGS

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:05.647
A BIT MORE I THINK EVEN WITH

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:06.681
THAT I THINK WE THOUGHT OF THE

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:08.183
REALLY SIMPLE AND NOW YOU KNOW

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:10.085
IF THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF --

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:11.853
YOU KNOW A LOT OF EXPLANATION

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.622
OF EVERY RULE AND EVERY MOVEMENT

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:14.890
SO WE WANTED TO KIND OF GET IT

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.158
DOWN TO JUST THE BASICS WHICH

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:17.793
WAS CASE RATES TEST POSITIVE

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.762
IT'S AN EASY AND SORT OF SOME OF

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.564
THE NATIONAL RENDERERS ALTHOUGH

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:23.732
UNFORTUNATE NOT A NATIONAL

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.167
STANDARD FOR THE DIFFERENT TIERS

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.169
-- THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE BASIC

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.004
KIND OF DATA THAT WE LOOK AT

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:30.105
FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION AS A

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:31.273
LEADING INDICATOR WE KNOW THAT

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:33.442
HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE -- AS FAR

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.077
AS THE DISEASE RELIGION ARE

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.278
LAGGING INDICATOR TYPICALLY

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:37.712
TAKES THREE WEEKS OR SO AFTER

01:18:37.779 --> 01:18:38.747
YOUR CASE RATES GO UP THEIR

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.248
HOUSES AND GO TO THE ONE ON

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:41.817
TOP OF THAT CERTAINLY AS WE'RE

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:43.919
LOOKING AT AT LOOKING AT ALL

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:44.786
THESE THINGS AND IF THE CASE

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.988
RATE INCREASES QUICKLY -- OR

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:48.090
WERE CONCERNED AND AGAIN WE'RE

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:49.057
WATCHING ALL THIS HOSPITAL

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:50.258
METRICS VERY CLOSELY WE'RE

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:51.626
DOING PROJECTIONS WITH -- CAL

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:53.528
CAT WHICH YOU CAN ALSO GET AND

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:55.330
ONLINE AND THEN WE HIGHLIGHTED

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.998
THIS I'M OVER THE LAST FEW

01:18:57.065 --> 01:18:58.300
DAYS THAT WE LOOK AT THIS

01:18:58.366 --> 01:18:59.668
PROJECTIONS ABOUT HOW SUFFICIENT

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:01.002
AND WE COULD INTERVENE SOONER

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:02.237
WE HAVE SAID RIGHT NOW THAT

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:04.439
TO MOVE BACKWARDS -- I COUNTY

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:05.740
WOULD NEED TO KIND OF BE AND

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.175
NOT MORE RESTRICTIVE TEARS OF

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.777
THEIR READ THAT THEIR METRIC

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:10.745
START TO LOOK MORE PURPLE --

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:12.447
OVER TWO WEEKS -- THAT WE WOULD

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:13.482
LOOK AT BACKGROUND BUT WE'RE

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:15.150
ALSO REALLY AGAIN CLOSING MINUS

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:16.651
HOSPITAL METRICS WEALTH BURKE

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:18.286
AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND WHETHER

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.621
FLU SURVEILLANCE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:22.023
LOOK AT ALL OKAY WELL I MEAN

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.258
I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.127
NEED FOR SIMPLIFICATION BUT ALSO

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:26.728
WE WE WANT WE WANT TO PRIVATIZE

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.497
ACCURACY TO ESPECIALLY THE FULL

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:30.031
PICTURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:32.200
DIFFERENT COUNTIES SO -- WELL

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:33.869
I KNOW YOU'RE MOVING TO ANY OF

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:34.936
THE BLUEPRINT IS SUPPOSED TO

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:36.738
BE MORE SIMPLE IT IS HI MIKE

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.206
MY FEAR MY CONCERN IS THAT

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:39.241
WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE FULL

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:40.775
PICTURE IN EACH COUNTY AND THAT

01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:42.010
WERE MISSING THINGS BECAUSE THE

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:43.879
METRIC WAS REMOVED ESPECIALLY

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:45.680
SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS --

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:46.948
HOSPITALIZATIONS BECAUSE THAT

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:48.216
WAS KIND OF THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.519
THE FIRST KIND OF STATE HOMELESS

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:51.820
TO INSURE THAT WE BENT THE CURVE

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:53.188
TO ENSURE HOSPITAL CAPACITY IS

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:55.457
THAT CORRECT THAT

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.592
IS RIGHT AND ALSO JUST TO REDUCE

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:59.294
OVERALL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:01.429
I THINK I'M OUR DASHBOARDS --

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:02.797
HOW STILL HAVE CONSULTATIONS

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:04.566
SO THE METRIC IN THE FRAMEWORK

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.168
IS LIKE THAT THE HIGHLY THAT

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:07.269
EVERYONE'S REALLY OF COURSE THE

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:08.436
MOST INTEREST BECAUSE IT DOES

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:09.471
IMPACT IT'S GOING TO OPEN OR

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:12.207
CLOSED BUT BOTH YOU ADAM AS

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:13.808
LEGISLATORS AND THE PUBLIC AND

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:15.944
WE I MEAN WE HAVE EVEN MORE DATA

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:17.779
BEHIND THE SCENES THAT WE'RE NOT

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:18.947
SHOWING EVERY SINGLE METRIC THAT

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:21.016
WE ARE HONORING THAT OF THAT OUR

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:22.317
PUBLIC DASHBOARDS AND THEY'RE

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:23.585
ABOUT TO GET UPDATED AGAIN

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.921
HOW HOSTAGE OUR THIRTY LOOK

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.422
AT NEW CONSTELLATIONS IS EVEN

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:28.723
MORE IMPORTANT TO CARE BECAUSE

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.358
HAS SEE A FLATTENING HOUSES

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:31.393
ASIANS BUT IT'S REALLY JUST

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:33.028
PULLING DISCHARGED OR THINGS

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.162
LIKE THAT SO ACTUALLY IN NEW

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:35.297
DATAPOINT WITHOUT IT OVER THE

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:37.632
LAST COUPLE MONTHS IS LOOKING

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:39.034
AT NEW HOSPITALIZATIONS AS WELL

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.435
SO WE HAVE THAT ON A SNAPSHOT

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:41.770
TOOL THAT WE LOOK AT EVERY DAY

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:43.838
-- VARIOUS EARLY AND THEN

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:45.040
AGAIN ON OUR PUBLIC DASHBOARD

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:46.274
RIGHT NOW THERE IS OVERALL

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:47.842
HOSPITALIZATIONS I SEE YOU

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:50.011
-- TEN PERCENT OF THOSE AND

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:51.379
AS WE INVOLVED WILL BE ADDING

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:52.581
MORE METRICS THAT THE PUBLIC

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:54.082
CAN FOLLOW ALONG AS WELL BUT

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:55.450
BUT THE HOSPITALIZATION METRIC

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:57.419
IS NOT USE FOR IN TERMS OF

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:58.453
MOVING COUNTIES UP AND DOWN

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.255
THE TEARS OR IN TERMS OF RE

01:21:00.322 --> 01:21:02.524
OPENING WITH THAT IS SOMETHING

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.025
THAT'S GOING TO BE RE EVALUATED

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:06.361
IN THE FUTURE CORNELL'S HER

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:08.930
AND AGAIN I THINK THE THE THE

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:10.198
BECAUSE OF THIS FOR US IS TO

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:12.601
THINK ABOUT THE -- THE METRICS

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:13.868
ARE MOVING FORWARD AND --

01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:15.170
THINK THAT OVERALL DISEASE

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:18.106
TRANSMISSION I THINK -- I THINK

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.574
WE HAVE SOME LANGUAGE IN THERE

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:21.710
AND WE CERTAINLY ANNA MORE --

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.312
BOTH METRIC AND QUALITATIVE --

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:25.981
LOOKING AT MOVING BACKWARDS OR

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:27.616
IF YOU NEED TO REALLY QUICKLY IF

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:28.583
YOU START TO SEE YOUR DOUBLING

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:29.851
TIME INCREASE YOUR ARE EFFECTIVE

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:31.052
INCREASE QUICKLY ENTER HOSTILE

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:32.187
SOLUTIONS WHICH AGAIN WOULD BE

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:34.689
LAGGING ACTUALLY AND THEN SO IT

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:35.824
IS IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:36.524
IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE TRYING

01:21:36.591 --> 01:21:38.526
TO BE MORE PREEMPTIVELY MORE

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:39.527
PREVENTIVE THAN LOOKING WE'RE

01:21:39.594 --> 01:21:40.662
TRYING TO PREVENT THAT HOSPITALS

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:41.663
SHOULD SEARCH AND LOOK AT THE

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:42.964
MODELING SO WE'RE FOLLOWING UP

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:44.165
WILL BE BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL TO

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:46.501
WAIT FOR JUST SIX RIGHT

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:47.569
I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE RELY

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:48.670
SOLELY ON IT I'M JUST SAYING

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.338
THAT THAT IT'S IT'S AND IT'S

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:51.873
STILL IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT AND

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.308
SO IT'S IT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:54.976
TO DEMAND TO PUT BACK INTO

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.878
THE TO THE POINT IF YOU WANT

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:57.812
AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT'S

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:59.881
HAPPENING IN EACH COMMUNITY --

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:01.916
IN TERMS OF BE A JUST A CASE

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.652
WITH A LOT OF COUNTIES KALEEM

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.620
THE WHENEVER PRESENT -- CLEARLY

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:08.189
ARE -- AFFECTED BY THE

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:10.225
HSE CASE RATE VERSUS THE ACTUAL

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:11.926
CASE RIGHT CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:13.795
WHY THAT ADJUSTMENT WAS PUT IN

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:16.998
SURE YEAH WE -- SPENT A LOT

01:22:17.065 --> 01:22:19.100
OF TIME AND ENERGY AND ACTUALLY

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:20.568
CONSULTED WITH NATIONAL

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.771
EPIDEMIOLOGIST EXPERTS -- SOME

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:25.040
OF WHOM -- YOU KNOW THE

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:26.708
DINO BROWN SCHOOL PUBLIC HEALTH

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.643
AND WHATEVER THE ODDS THE WORKS

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:29.544
THE TIME FREEDOM THE FORMER

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.880
DIRECTOR OF CDC WE HAVE WORKED

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:33.381
WITH OTHERS TO LOOK AT STATE

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:34.916
AVERAGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:36.151
AND WATER BENCHMARKS THAT WE

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:37.719
NEED TO DO FOR TESTIFIED TO DO

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.054
ADEQUATE CASE FINDING TICKETS

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.622
WILL THIS EPIDEMIC AND PANDEMIC

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:42.424
AND SO BY LOOKING AT THAT

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.591
AGAINST EIGHT HOURS OF TRYING

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:45.994
TO ASSESS WATER SORT OF VOLUME

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:47.395
TESTING VOLUME THEN TURNS TO

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:48.263
MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING ENOUGH

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.098
KEYS FINDINGS OR NOT AGAIN NOT

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:50.965
SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

01:22:51.032 --> 01:22:53.568
COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO NOT --

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.770
SORT OF -- WE DIDN'T WANT TO

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.906
CLOSE QUOTE TONNAGE COUNTY IS

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:59.574
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO A LOT

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:00.675
OF TESTING INDICATES FUNDING

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.477
BUT FINDING MORE CASES AND

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.979
THEN HAVING TO HOLD BACK SO --

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:06.915
THROUGH A LOT OF ANALYSIS AGAIN

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:08.583
OF STATEWIDE DATA AND NATIONAL

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.285
DATA WE CAME UP WITH THE LINEAR

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:11.219
ADJUSTMENT SO THAT IF YOU'RE

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:13.254
TESTING ABOVE AND THERE'S A CAP

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:14.622
ON THAT BUT IF WE LOOK AT WHAT

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:16.224
IS THE STATE MEDIA WE PICKED

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:17.959
UP AND PARKS -- BASICALLY EVERY

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:19.394
FOUR WEEKS ABOUT EVERY MONTH

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:21.629
TO TO SAY WHAT'S THE MEDIA

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:23.131
AND AND IF YOU'RE ABOVE THAT

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:24.532
YOU CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE YOUR

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:26.201
ADJUSTED CASE THAT SAID IF

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:27.669
YOU'RE ACTIVELY TESTING FINDING

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:29.504
ISOLATING YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:31.439
SORT OF -- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:33.274
HELP BEHIND FOR DOING THAT WORK

01:23:33.608 --> 01:23:34.609
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.344
IF YOU'RE NOT TESTING ENOUGH --

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:37.512
THE PORTION WHERE WHERE YOU'RE

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:39.447
MISSING CASES RATED NOTHING MANY

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:40.982
MISSING CASES SO THAT'S SORT OF

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:42.183
THE THEORY BEHIND IT AND THEN

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:45.019
AGAIN A LOT OF WORK ON DIFFERENT

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:46.121
WAYS TO LOOK AT THAT IT JUST

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:47.622
MIGHT AND AGAIN THERE'S A CAP AT

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:48.990
THE BOTTOM AND THE TOP OF THAT

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:50.525
AND THE MIDDLE IS CONVENIENT AND

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:52.026
THEN WORK BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:54.195
OF ISSUES AS WELL WITH FIRES AND

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:55.430
AIR QUALITY SOME OF THE TESTING

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:56.931
STATES HAVE BEEN UNAVAILABLE

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.533
SO THAT'S THE OTHER IMPORTERS

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.301
AND HAVE THE MEDIA AND NOT JUST

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:02.570
A SOLID BENCH MARK THAT IS THE

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:04.973
SAME ALL THE TIME I GUESS IT

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:06.341
HAVE YOU HEARD THOUGH THAT FROM

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.976
THE THE NEED FROM FROM MY MY

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.878
EXPERIENCE IN KERN COUNTY AND

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:11.846
ANSWER OTHER MY LET MY OTHER

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:12.714
COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPERIENCE THE

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.149
SAME THING WHEN WE WENT FROM

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:16.084
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TEST SHOULD

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:18.720
GET ONE TOO WHEN WE WERE

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.655
RUNNING SHORT OF AB TESTING KITS

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:22.023
THEN IT WAS ONLY SYMPTOMATIC

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:24.392
INDIVIDUALS -- WERE TO BE TESTED

01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:26.661
AND NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY CREATING

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:29.164
A A BLUEPRINT OR A METRIC IN

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.099
WHICH IT'S TIED TO THE AMOUNT

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:32.400
OF TESTING YOU DO BUT NOW WE

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:34.302
WANT PEOPLE TO GET TESTED SO

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.204
THIS PING PONG AND -- IN THE

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:37.672
IN THE COMMUNITY AND AND IN

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.541
IN THE PUBLIC HAS CREATED IS

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:40.909
NOT NEW DIFFICULTY OF GETTING

01:24:40.975 --> 01:24:42.777
INDIVIDUALS TO GET TESTED AND

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:44.546
NOW THAT'S A KEY COMPONENT FOR

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:45.947
ACTUALLY MOVING TO THE TEARS

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:48.550
SELL -- MAYBE EVEN ADD SOME

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:49.984
PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF HOW DO

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:52.854
YOU GET PEOPLE TO GET TESTED

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:55.156
IF WE WE'RE KINDA GETTING MIXED

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:57.959
MESSAGES SURE I MEAN

01:24:58.026 --> 01:24:59.461
I GET ON IT KNOWLEDGE I THINK

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:01.663
AT ALL LEVELS AGAIN THAT THAT

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:03.064
KNOWLEDGE AND EVIDENCE ABOUT

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:04.532
WHY TO DO WELL AROUND THIS

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:06.234
PANDEMIC ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:07.802
-- YOU'VE HEARD NATIONAL

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:09.037
CONGRESS IS WELL OVER WHO

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:10.138
SHOULD BE TESTED OR NOT AND A

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:11.806
LOT OF THAT IS REALLY BACK TO

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:12.974
WHAT'S YOUR CAPACITY SO WHEN

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:14.075
YOU HAVE LIMITED CAPACITY YOU

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.610
HAVE TO PRIORITIZE WHEN YOU

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:16.778
HAVE LIMITED CAPACITY WE REALLY

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:18.246
THOUGHT OKAY YOU ONLY WANNA

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:19.914
DOESN'T NOT PEOPLE THE OTHER

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:21.516
REASON THAT MESSAGE INVOLVED AS

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:23.017
WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH OVER THE

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:23.985
LAST SEVERAL MONTHS ABOUT THIS

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:25.620
DISEASE AND WE DID NOT REALIZE

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:28.189
UNTIL IS ALWAYS HARD FOR ME OF

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:29.390
A TIME TO KEEP TRACK OF WHEN

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:30.725
WE LEARNED LET THAT YOU KNOW

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.327
WE KNOW THAT FORTY PERCENT OF

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:33.695
PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE NO SYMPTOMS

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:36.498
ALSO WE WILL MISS CASES IF WE'RE

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:37.999
ONLY TESTING SYSTEMATIC PEOPLE

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.467
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO PRIORITIZE

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:41.302
SO AND WE JUST RECENTLY ALSO

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:43.204
IN THE LAST WEEK DID AS TO YOUR

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:44.372
POINT CHANGE THAT MESSAGE AGAIN

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:45.440
WE HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY IN

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:46.674
THE STATE WERE UNDER UTILIZING

01:25:46.741 --> 01:25:47.876
ALSO TO YOUR POINT SO WE WANT

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.644
PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT IF YOU

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:51.880
ARE IN A HIGH RISK SETTING --

01:25:52.146 --> 01:25:53.548
THAT YOU SHOULD GET TESTED SO

01:25:53.615 --> 01:25:55.149
WE DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO WORK

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:56.217
ON IMPROVING OUR MESSAGING

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:58.052
AROUND THAT AND AGAIN THE THE

01:25:58.119 --> 01:25:59.187
SCIENCE AROUND THIS INVOLVES

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:00.889
AND AND THAT IS WHY OF ALL

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.724
ISN'T AS WE GET MORE CAPACITY

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:03.925
AGAIN I THINK THERE'S MORE

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.760
AND MORE I'M INTERESTED IN

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.295
WATER HIKES VALENCE TESTING IN

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:08.329
CERTAIN SETTINGS YOU'VE PROBABLY

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:09.364
HEARD THIS AND SKILLED NURSING

01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:10.698
FACILITIES BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:12.967
HIGH RISK SITUATION BUT ON WHERE

01:26:13.034 --> 01:26:14.369
YOU CAN GET DIZZY IS THE HIGH

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:16.437
RISK OF THE POPULATION OR VISIT

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:17.739
IN OPPOSITION THE DALLAS THAT

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:19.340
WE WANT THAT TEST SORT OF STAFF

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:20.942
THERE YOU KNOW PERIODICALLY

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:22.143
AND ACTUALLY WEEKLY IS WHAT'S

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:24.045
NEEDED SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY AND

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.446
TARGET AUDIENCE TO BE STRATEGIC

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:26.681
AND I ALSO WANNA AGREE AND

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:27.649
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE WANT TO BE

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:28.883
STRATEGIC ABOUT OUR TESTING IS

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:30.051
NOT JUST THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.719
GET TESTED THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:33.087
HIGH RISK SETTINGS OR CONTINUE

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:34.389
TO OF ALL THOSE PRIORITIES AS

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:36.224
WE MODIFIER CAPACITY AND THEN

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:37.425
THERE'S MORE TESTING TECHNOLOGY

01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:38.826
THAT'S ON THE HORIZON THAT

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:40.061
WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:42.530
PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR RISE OF AS

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:44.232
BUT AS MORE AS YOU'RE PUSHING

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:45.400
MORE MEANS YOU'RE PUSHING

01:26:45.466 --> 01:26:46.734
COUNTIES TO TEST MORE BECAUSE

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:47.669
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:48.736
GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TO THE

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:50.204
TEARS RIGHT I MEAN YOU HAVE A

01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:52.740
SITUATION WHERE THEY HAD THE THE

01:26:52.807 --> 01:26:55.276
UNADJUSTED CASE RATE IS LOWER

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:56.144
THAN THE ADDRESS IT BECAUSE

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:57.979
YOU'RE JUST COUNTIES UP AND

01:26:58.179 --> 01:27:00.248
SO THE THE THE COULD IS THERE

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:02.016
ENOUGH SUPPLIES OF TEST KITS

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.384
AND REAGENTS MOVING FORWARD

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:05.320
TO ENSURE THAT AS COUNTIES

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:06.955
BEGIN TO RAMP UP TESTING THAT

01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:08.389
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RUN INTO

01:27:08.456 --> 01:27:09.691
THE SITUATION THAT THEY DID

01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:12.026
YOU KNOW MONTHS AGO WHERE

01:27:12.093 --> 01:27:13.661
WE'RE RUNNING SHORT ON TESTS

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.564
SO CURRENTLY THANKFULLY RIGHT

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:17.765
NOW WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:20.134
SUPPLIES AND SHORTAGES OF SUPPLY

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:22.036
OF TEST KITS OR REAGENTS AND

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:23.771
THINGS LIKE THAT A GUN MOVING

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:24.906
FORWARD THAT'S GOING TO BE A

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:26.975
PREDICT UNPREDICTABLE BUT THAT'S

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.376
THERE'S TWO THINGS I THINK TO

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:29.744
TO RESPOND TO THAT AGAIN THAT'S

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:31.279
WHY WE HAVE A MEDIAN OF THE

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:32.146
STATE WIDE BECAUSE IF THERE

01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:33.448
ARE ISSUES THAT'S GOING TO

01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:35.416
AFFECT EVERYBODY SO THE MEDIAN

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:37.485
IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE LOWER --

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:39.053
IF PEOPLE IF THERE IS A SUPPLY

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.088
ISSUE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:41.322
DOUBLING OUR CAPACITY ONCE THE

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.791
PERKINELMER LAB OPENS -- AND

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:44.692
THEN I THINK AGAIN THE REALLY

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:46.127
THE PRINCIPLE IS BECAUSE IT'S

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:47.295
NOT JUST TO DO THE TESTING

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:48.997
AND SO THAT WE CAN FIND CASES

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:51.833
ISOLATE THEM CONTACTS QUARANTINE

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:53.468
RIGHT IT'S IT'S HOW SHE DID IT

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:54.569
CONTAIN THE DISEASE THAT'S THE

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:56.704
MITIGATION WITH IS CLOSING OF

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:58.673
SECTORS AND YOU KNOW THE MASSIVE

01:27:58.973 --> 01:27:59.707
DOESN'T THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:01.376
CONTIENEN IT HAS TO BE LAYERED

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:02.810
ON TOP OF THAT WITH THE TESTING

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:04.646
AND FINDING IT SURE AND AND AND

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:06.080
AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:07.515
IMPORTANCE OF TESTING AND I'M

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:09.283
I'M OF COURSE MYSELF AND OTHER

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:10.485
OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE ENCOURAGING

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:11.719
EVERYONE TO GET TESTED AND

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:13.588
EACH OF THE COMMITTEES IF THEY

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:14.822
IF THEY'RE SYMPTOMATIC OR IF

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:15.990
THEY'VE IF THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:18.159
SO I'D I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:20.228
SINCE THE CIRCUMSTANCE I WILL I

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:21.796
APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS AND OLDER

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:22.930
THERE'S A FEW MORE QUESTIONS

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:25.299
IT IN KERN COUNTY AND IN THE

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:27.035
CENTER VALLEY WE'VE OBVIOUSLY

01:28:27.101 --> 01:28:28.302
HAD THE BENEFIT OF HAVING

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:30.438
FEDERAL MOBILE TESTING SITES IN

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:31.706
WORKING WITH CONJUNCTION WITH

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:33.574
CALLAWAY YES BUT THERE'S BEEN

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:35.977
SITUATIONS WHERE THOUSANDS I

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.045
I THINK THE LACK OF THE LATEST

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:38.479
NUMBER HEARD WHEN THE PREVIOUSLY

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:39.647
WAS EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED NEGATIVE

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:41.816
TESTS WERE NOT INCLUDED --

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.518
IN THE STATE DATABASE EVEN

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:44.852
THOUGH THE CURRENT AND MAYBE

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:46.287
THIS IS -- IN REFERENCE OF A

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:47.822
VISIT TO -- TO MY COLLEAGUES

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:48.756
IN THE MEMBER COOPER'S

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.957
RESPONSE THAT MET SOME OF

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:52.326
THAT WAS PAPER REPORTING VERSE

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:54.562
IS ELECTRONIC BUT IS IT THE

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:56.130
POSITION OF CV PH THAT ALL

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:57.699
TEST WHEN THEY'RE TAKEN ARE IT

01:28:57.765 --> 01:28:59.233
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DATA

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.835
THAT'S PROVIDED IN CAR READY

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:04.138
YES AND WE KNOW THAT THAT

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:05.440
SPECIFIC SITUATION AND AS YOU

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:06.908
POINTED OUT AS A FEDERAL ASSET

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:08.342
THAT WAS DEPLOYED AND THEY

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:10.244
WHEN THEY DEPLOYED NOT REALLY

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:11.646
ON THAT THAT'S A MISSION TO

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:13.648
US SO WE ARE STILL WORKING ON

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:15.550
THAT DIRECT DATA FEED BUT IN

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:16.617
THE MEANTIME WE'RE RECEIVING

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.119
THAT DATA INDIRECTLY INCLUDING

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.588
INTO THE COUNTIES OKAY BECAUSE

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:22.156
MY CONCERN IS INCLUDED THAT

01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:23.891
THAT WAS THAT RETROSPECTIVELY

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:25.259
BUT MOVING FORWARD WE'RE STILL

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:26.561
WE STILL ARE UTILIZING THE

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:27.695
MOBILE TESTING SITES AND I

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:28.830
BELIEVE THAT AS WE'RE TRYING

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:30.565
TO RAMP UP AND AS YOU INDICATED

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:33.668
IDENTIFY CERTAIN HOT SPOTS

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:34.802
IN THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:36.137
THAT THE MOBILE TESTING SITES

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:37.438
WILL BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:38.239
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:40.475
POPULATIONS THAT ARE -- IN NEED

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.844
SO CLEARLY WE WANT TO ENSURE

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.278
THAT THERE'S A PROCESS IN PLACE

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:45.980
THAT AS THOSE TESTING SITES

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.483
CONTINUE TO TEST ESPECIALLY IN

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:50.084
AN INVALID YOU KNOW COMMUNITY

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:51.185
KERN COUNTY THAT THERE'S

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:53.554
ARE THOSE ARE COUNTED YES

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:56.023
ABSOLUTELY OKAY -- AND THEN

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:59.393
LASTLY I GUESS IS -- MAYBE

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.828
I THIS IS A BROADER QUESTION

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:02.163
BUT YOU CAN INDICATED IN THE

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.531
DARK CIRCUMVENTS THAT HAPPENED

THE WILDFIRES ARE CLEARLY ONE

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:07.101

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:12.140
EVALUATE OVER TIME AS WE LOOK

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:14.108
AT THE DATA AS WE LOOK AT TRENDS

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:16.244
AS THINGS ARE IMPROVING WITH

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:18.546
THOSE GUIDANCES CHANGE OR

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:19.647

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:25.686
REEVALUATED AND -- AND HOW CAN

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:26.754

START WITH JUST A QUESTION FOR

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:39.026
DOCTOR PAN ABOUT THE --

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.829
THE COLOR TIER SYSTEM OUT

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:44.498
ONE SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR

01:31:45.867 --> 01:31:47.101
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.836
HAS BEEN THAT THE COLORS APPLY

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:50.938
ON A COUNTY WIDE LEVEL --

WHICH IS REALLY YOU KNOW KIND

01:31:52.273 --> 01:31:54.408
OF ARBITRARY LINES ON A MAP --

01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:56.210
IT IS NOT CONNECTED TO SORT OF

01:31:56.277 --> 01:31:57.879
THE REAL WORLD CIRCUMSTANCES OF

01:31:57.945 --> 01:32:00.147
CONTIGUOUS COMMUNITIES -- SO THE

01:32:00.214 --> 01:32:01.849
CITY OF FOLSOM WHICH I REPRESENT

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.252
AS VERY LOW CASE RATE AND IT'S

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:06.754
-- PHYSICALLY SITUATED -- RIGHT

01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:08.856
NEXT EL DORADO HILLS -- WHICH IS

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:10.691
PART WHICH IS IN THE THE THIRD

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:11.993
LEVEL WHAT IS THAT I GUESS THE

01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:14.896
ORANGE -- TEAR -- WHEREAS

01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:16.297
FULSOME BECAUSE IT JUST HAPPENS

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:17.865
TO BE PART OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY

01:32:18.232 --> 01:32:20.368
-- IS IN THE PURPLE HERE SO --

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:21.535
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RIGHT NEXT

01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:23.404
TO EACH OTHER THAT HAVE VERY

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.406
SIMILAR -- PROFILES AND IT COMES

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:27.541
TO -- THE PREVALENCE OF KOBE

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:29.577
NINETEEN IN THE COMMUNITY -- ARE

01:32:29.644 --> 01:32:31.379
SUBJECTED TO VASTLY DIFFERENT

01:32:31.712 --> 01:32:33.814
-- RESTRICTIONS WHEN IT COMES

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:34.715
TO BUSINESSES AND EVERYTHING

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:36.450
ELSE SO HAVE IS YOUR DEPARTMENT

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:38.753
LOOKED AT DOING THIS IN A WAY

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:41.722
THAT IS MORE FOCUSED

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:42.890
AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:46.260
SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:47.828
HAS COME UP A FEW TIMES AND I

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.697
THINK I THINK THERE ARE MANY

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:51.832
-- SORT OF CHALLENGES RELATED

01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:53.467
TO LOOKING AT SOMETHING HAVING

01:32:53.534 --> 01:32:54.936
WIDE VERSUS CITIES ARE OTHERS

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:56.304
AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION YOU

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.205
KNOW WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE IS NOT

01:32:58.272 --> 01:33:00.007
NO SORT OF COUNTY BORDERS ARE

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:01.776
CITY BORDERS BUT WE DO HAVE TO

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:03.978
-- WE DO HAVE TO EVALUATE THESE

01:33:04.045 --> 01:33:06.113
THINGS AND -- PROVIDE GOVERNANCE

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.381
IN THE STRUCTURES THAT WE HAVE

01:33:07.815 --> 01:33:09.750
SO I THINK -- YOU KNOW AGAIN WE

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:11.819
KNOW THAT THAT'S -- THOSE ARE

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:13.054
CONSIDERATIONS AT THE COUNTY

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.155
LEVEL AS WELL PEOPLE HAVE

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:15.589
BEEN LOOKING AT I THINK OUR

01:33:15.656 --> 01:33:17.258
APPROACH IS STILL THAT YOU KNOW

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:19.193
WE NEED TO YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.729
ACTUALLY TOUCH ON -- WE WILL

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:22.830
LIKELY BE SAYING WHAT HONOR

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:23.931
HEALTH EQUITY METRIC THAT YOU

01:33:23.998 --> 01:33:25.299
KNOW YOU REALLY WANT TO CLOSE

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.069
USING A LIST OF TRANSMISSION

01:33:28.135 --> 01:33:30.738
ALISTAIR HE -- AND HAVE KIND

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:32.006
OF ALL GOVERNMENT ALL COMMUNITY

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:33.808
APPROACH TO REALLY GET YOU KNOW

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:34.942
FIND WHERE YOUR HIGHEST HOT

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:35.876
SPOTS ARE AND WHERE DISEASE

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:37.078
TRANSMISSION DOESN'T GET THOSE

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:37.979
DOWN AND THAT WILL HELP ALL

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:39.880
OF YOU MOVE FORWARD NANCY THAT

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:41.015
PRINCIPLE CAN APPLY DIFFERENT

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:42.316
WAYS WHETHER IT'S CERTAIN

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:44.518
COMMUNITIES CERTAIN GEOGRAPHY --

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:47.054
THAT WE WE HAVE HEARD INTEREST

01:33:47.121 --> 01:33:48.356
IN THAT AND I WILL ACTUALLY

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:49.890
SPEAK AS A WHEN I WAS AT A LOCAL

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:51.125
COUNTY LEVEL THAT REQUEST CAME

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:52.426
TO ME AT A LOCAL KIND OF LEVEL

01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:54.228
I ALSO DID NOT THINK THAT WE

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:55.529
COULD DO THAT JUST BECAUSE WE

01:33:55.596 --> 01:33:57.198
NEED TO YOU KNOW GOVERN AND

01:33:57.264 --> 01:33:58.265
THE STRUCTURES THAT WE HAVE

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:01.135
IN THE STRUCTURES WE HAVE

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.704
ZERO YOU MEAN THAT THAT COUNTY

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:04.772
GOVERNMENT IS THE STRUCTURALLY

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:05.906
HAPPENED SO THAT'S JUST KIND

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:07.875
OF WHERE YOU'RE PLACING THAT

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:10.044
-- YOU KNOW THE THE ASSIGNMENT

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:10.878
OF DIFFERENT CALLERS TO THE

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:11.779
COUNTY LEVEL BECAUSE THAT JUST

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:14.015
HAPPENS TO BE THE THE SYSTEM THE

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:15.149
GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:16.283
IS THAT THE JUST WHAT YOU'RE

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:18.519
SAYING THERE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:34:18.586 --> 01:34:19.954
DEPARTMENT SYSTEM IS LARGELY

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:21.422
COUNTY BASED THERE ARE CITY HALL

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:22.623
THREE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:24.058
AND AND ACTUALLY THOSE THREE

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:25.860
CITIES ALL AROUND THAT IT AND

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:27.461
TO COUNTIES AND THOSE CITIES

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:29.563
ARE ALSO HAVING TO FOLLOW ALONG

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.265
AND AND AND BE PART OF THE

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:32.700
COUNTY METRICS BECAUSE AGAIN

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:35.069
-- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY YEAH

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:36.437
I KNOW YOU GREAT SOME POINTS

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.105
ABOUT PERIPHERAL VERSES WITH

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:39.340
THEN THAT THEY'RE ALL WITHIN

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:41.008
ONE ENTITY AND THEY THE CITY

01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:41.809
HEALTH DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:42.877
HAVE COMPLETE LOCAL HEALTH

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:43.744
AUTHORITY BUT THEY ACTUALLY

01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:45.813
CANNOT CANNOT HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.515
RULE TO MOVE YOU KNOW WITHIN THE

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:49.250
TEARS OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTY

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:52.319
OKAY JUST DO THAT THAT DOESN'T

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:54.789
SEEM TO ME TO TO REALLY

01:34:54.855 --> 01:34:56.957
GET TO THAT THE CONCERN AT

01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:59.593
WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW WERE --

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:01.829
CREATING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

01:35:01.896 --> 01:35:03.397
BASIS OF PREVALENCE OF COVER

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:05.232
NINETEEN IN A GIVEN REGION --

01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:07.068
BUT -- IT'S BEING DONE IN SUCH A

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:09.537
BROAD BRUSH THE WAY THAT YOU

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:12.006
HAVE -- COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:14.175
YOU KNOW CLOSER PHYSICALLY TO

01:35:14.408 --> 01:35:16.744
-- AREAS THAT ARE IN THE WORST

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:17.845
YEAR THAN THEY ARE TO THE MORE

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:19.146
PROBLEMATIC AREAS OF THEIR OWN

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:21.849
COUNTY -- AND YET -- ARE BEING

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:24.452
FORCED INTO A TEAR THAT

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:27.254
CLEARLY IS NOT THE CORRECT

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:29.023
ONES FOR THEM SO WHAT WOULD YOU

01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:30.791
TELL A CITY LIKE FOLSOM YOU KNOW

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:32.626
WHAT DO THEY NEED TO SHOW YOU IN

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:35.096
ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THE SORT

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:36.864
OF INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY

01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:39.600
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:42.203
ASSIGNMENT OF A TEAR THAT IS

01:35:42.269 --> 01:35:44.338
NOT -- YOU KNOW SIMPLY AT THE

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:45.739
MERCY OF THE REST OF THE COUNTY

01:35:47.675 --> 01:35:48.876
I MEAN AGAIN I THINK THE OTHER

01:35:48.943 --> 01:35:50.244
REALLY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES THAT

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:51.779
DISEASE TRANSMISSION YOU KNOW

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:53.247
IT THIS VIRUSES SPECIFICALLY

01:35:53.314 --> 01:35:54.648
MOVES VERY QUICKLY WE'VE SEEN

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:56.250
HOW QUICKLY THINGS ESCALATED

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:58.419
THIS SUMMER IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:35:58.486 --> 01:35:59.687
CERTAINLY IN CERTAIN REGIONS

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:01.689
SO JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:02.823
GEOGRAPHICALLY PARTS NOT MEAN

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.258
PEOPLE CANNOT GO BACK AND FORTH

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:05.493
AND WE'RE CERTAINLY DISCOURAGING

01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:06.527
PEOPLE FROM MIXING ACROSS

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:07.561
COMMUNITIES AS ONE OF THE KEY

01:36:07.628 --> 01:36:09.163
PRINCIPLES AS I MENTIONED FOR

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:11.532
THE SECTORS BUT AGAIN I THINK

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:13.234
YOU KNOW SIGNED I JUST GOT

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:14.635
THAT THAT DOESN'T GET TO THE

01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:15.870
QUESTION MANY PEOPLE CAN CROSS

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:17.071
COUNTY LINES AS WELL SO THAT'S

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:18.038
AN ARGUMENT AGAINST HAVING

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:19.039
DIFFERENT TIERS FOR DIFFERENT

01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:20.474
COUNTIES I MEAN THE QUESTION

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:22.977
IS SPECIFICALLY -- ESPECIALLY

01:36:23.043 --> 01:36:23.811
WHEN YOU HAVE CASES LIKE THE

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:25.412
CITY OF FOLSOM WHY CAN'T THE

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:28.048
STATE ESTABLISH A SET OF

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:31.752
CRITERIA TO ALLOW -- IN CASES

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:33.587
LIKE THAT A GREATER DEGREE

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:34.889
OF FLEXIBILITY IN THE COUNTY

01:36:34.955 --> 01:36:36.290
BY COUNTY SYSTEM OFFERS

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.161
I THINK IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT I

01:36:40.227 --> 01:36:42.596
READ I MEAN WHEN WE HAVE COUNTY

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:45.065
BASED SORT OF -- ORDINANCES

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:46.667
OR RULES OR STATEWIDE THINGS

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.135
ARE COUNTY BASED THAT WE CAN'T

01:36:48.202 --> 01:36:49.937
NECESSARILY CHANGE THOSE FOR

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:52.706
SPECIFIC -- SUBGROUPS WELL SURE

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:53.774
YOU CAN THE STATE'S CREATING

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:54.742
THE WHOLE SYSTEM I MEAN THIS

01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:55.943
IS AN ENTIRELY NEW THING THAT

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:56.944
THE STATE'S PUT IN PLACE THAT

01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:58.512
CAN DO IT HOWEVER WANTS RIGHT

01:36:58.579 --> 01:36:59.713
WHITE WHY CAN'T THAT BE DONE

01:37:00.414 --> 01:37:01.549
BUT IT'S BASED ON THE CRACKS OF

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:02.716
WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:03.751
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS

01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:05.619
WELL AND OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:06.854
DEPARTMENTS ARE COUNTY THIS AND

01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:08.923
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR WORKING

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:10.491
ON COULD DISEASE TRANSMISSION

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:12.293
AND PREVENTION AND CONTROL ARE

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:13.661
IN COLLABORATION WITH THEIR

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:14.528
THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:16.564
COUNTY -- AND OTHER CITIES

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:19.166
TO SEE THAT AT A COUNTY LEVEL

01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:22.436
C. CERTIFIED SAY SACRAMENTO

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:23.304
COUNTY'S PUBLIC HEALTH

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:24.338
DEPARTMENT EXPRESSED A

01:37:24.405 --> 01:37:26.006
WILLINGNESS TO WORK TO CREATE

01:37:26.974 --> 01:37:29.109
A MORE FLEXIBLE A SET OF

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:31.145
CRITERIA FOR FULSOME AND

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:32.179
SAID THAT THAT WAS YOU

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:33.414
KNOW SOMEONE THAT THEY CAN

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.548
MANAGE WITH YOUR APARTMENT

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:35.783
BE OKAY SIGNING OFF ON THAT

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:38.519
WE WOULD STILL BE

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:39.987
ASSIGNING THE SAME TEARS

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:41.155
BASED ON THE COUNTY LEVEL

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.391
ALL RIGHT WELL I WOULD -- SIMPLY

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:46.727
ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:37:46.794 --> 01:37:47.995
TAKE A MORE WE ARE REAL WORLD

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:49.463
APPROACH I THINK THAT SIMPLY

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:50.431
SINGLE IT'S EASIER TO DO IT

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:51.732
BY COUNTY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

01:37:51.799 --> 01:37:53.601
WE HAPPEN TO HAVE -- YOU KNOW

01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:54.969
DIFFERENT UNITS OF GOVERNMENT

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:56.737
READY MADE IN EXISTING PUBLIC

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:59.073
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS I UNDERSTAND

01:37:59.139 --> 01:38:00.474
THAT BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:01.775
ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS HERE

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:03.410
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES

01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:05.045
THAT ARE BEING FORCED TO CLOSE

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:06.213
PERMANENTLY YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.181
TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITIES

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:09.450
THAT MAY NEVER RECOVER IN SOME

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:10.951
WAYS AND JUST SAY WELL IT'S

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:12.052
IT'S JUST EASIER TO DO IT AT

01:38:12.119 --> 01:38:13.787
THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT TO ME

01:38:13.854 --> 01:38:15.222
IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:19.093
MOVING ON TO THE THE DATA

01:38:19.159 --> 01:38:21.762
GLITCH -- SO I --

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:24.098
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM ACTING

01:38:24.164 --> 01:38:27.067
DIRECTOR SHE READ -- IN --

01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:29.136
AUGUST AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:30.771
-- IN WHICH SHE NOTED THERE'S

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.740
BEEN THE DEPARTMENT IS BUILT

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:34.708
REDUNDANT PROCESSES TO VALIDATE

01:38:34.775 --> 01:38:35.943
THE DATA REPORTS FOLLOWING

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:37.578
THE GLITCH AND INDEED WE'VE

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:39.480
HEARD A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:40.681
ABOUT THAT TODAY I'VE HEARD

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:42.049
FROM A COUPLE OF THE FOLKS

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:43.450
WHO HAVE TESTIFIED ABOUT

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:45.386
PARALLEL VALIDATION SYSTEMS

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:46.987
AN INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION

01:38:47.054 --> 01:38:49.790
CHANNELS SO JUST TO CLARIFY

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:52.259
THESE ARE ALL REDUNDANCIES

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:53.260
THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:54.862
FOLLOWING THE DATA QUITS RIGHT

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:58.565
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY YES

01:38:58.932 --> 01:39:01.268
WE WE WERE DOING SOME CHECKING

01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:03.203
BUT I'M NOT AT THE EXTENT

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:05.005
THAT WAS REQUIRED WITH THE

01:39:05.072 --> 01:39:06.874
VOLUME INCREASE AT THAT --

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.342
THE LEVELS THAT IT'S GONE UP

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:09.710
ARE THEY JUST MADE THERE WAS

01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:11.278
MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMETHING

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:12.980
TO HAPPEN SO THEY'VE THEY'VE

01:39:13.047 --> 01:39:14.148
BEEN IMPLEMENTED STARTING

01:39:14.214 --> 01:39:15.449
THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST AS

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:18.052
WE UNCOVER ALL THE ISSUES AND

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:20.220
DEVELOPS OF COUNTER BALANCES AND

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:22.589
-- ALTERNATE WAYS TO VALIDATE

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:24.158
EVERY SINGLE DAY THE METRICS

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:26.727
SEASON IS THE VOLUME INCREASE

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:27.895
THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:28.862
SOMETHING TO HAPPEN I GUESS

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:30.798
THAT'S WHAT I FIND A LITTLE

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:32.599
MYSTIFYING ABOUT THIS THIS WHOLE

01:39:32.666 --> 01:39:33.834
INCIDENT IS THAT YOU KNOW I'VE

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:35.069
HEARD TIME AND AGAIN THE CAL

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:36.403
READY SYSTEM WAS NOT A SYSTEM

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:37.671
DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE SORT OF

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:38.739
ALL YOUR BILL IS NOT DESIGNED TO

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.374
HANDLE THE SORT OF ALL I AM --

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.875
AND YET IT TOOK AN INCIDENT LIKE

01:39:41.942 --> 01:39:44.778
THIS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

01:39:44.845 --> 01:39:46.080
TO PUT IN PLACE THE SORT OF

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:48.182
REDUNDANCIES -- WHICH ARE

01:39:48.248 --> 01:39:50.351
YOU KNOW SORT OF A STANDARD

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:52.019
FEATURE OF OF ENGINEERING WHEN

01:39:52.086 --> 01:39:53.320
YOU HAVE A CRITICAL SYSTEM

01:39:53.587 --> 01:39:54.621
-- IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THE

01:39:54.688 --> 01:39:55.989
SUNLIGHT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO WHITE

01:39:56.056 --> 01:39:57.224
WHY WAS THAT NOT DONE SOONER

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:58.559
ESPECIALLY GIVEN HOW HEAVILY THE

01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:00.794
STATE HAS RELIED ON THIS DATA

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:06.967
WELL -- SO THE RIVER

01:40:07.034 --> 01:40:09.169
-- RELYING ON THE DATA OVER

01:40:09.236 --> 01:40:10.871
THE PAST FEW YEARS IS IT WAS

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:12.239
SIGNIFICANT AND EVERYTHING

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:14.241
WAS IMPORTANT BUT WHEN COVERT

01:40:14.308 --> 01:40:16.977
CAME THE DATA METRICS --

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:19.079
WERE LARGE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:20.681
BUT THEY ALSO WERE NEEDED EVERY

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:23.117
SINGLE DAY IT AT SO THE

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:26.220
URGENCY OF UP YEAR LARGE COMING

01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:27.554
INTO THE SYSTEM AND BEING

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:29.990
COUNTED THAT DAY WERE MUCH

01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:31.291
MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THEY

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:33.627
WERE YEAR TWO YEARS AGO SO WE

01:40:33.694 --> 01:40:35.829
WATCH THE SYSTEMS -- WE WERE

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:37.798
DOING FIVE THOUSAND MESSAGES

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:38.999
A DAY IN OUR GATEWAY NOW WE'RE

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:41.568
DOING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SO

01:40:41.835 --> 01:40:44.171
UP THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES ARE

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:45.472
ACTUALLY DESIGNED BUT THEY

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:47.141
ARE WORKING UNDER THE NEW LOW

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:48.308
BECAUSE WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT

01:40:48.375 --> 01:40:50.911
IMPROVEMENTS BUT -- AT THE TIME

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:52.746
THEY WERE OPERATING AT A PACE

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:54.047
BASED ON THE MESSAGES THAT WERE

01:40:54.114 --> 01:40:56.016
COMING INTO THE SYSTEM AND WE

01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:58.118
FELT THAT WE HAD A REALLY GOOD

01:40:58.185 --> 01:41:00.053
HANDLE ON ON ALL THE LABS ARE

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.755
REPORTING AND HOW OFTEN YOU'RE

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:03.524
REPORTING THAT THE NUMBERS

01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:05.058
GOING UP MORE LAPSED MORE

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:07.928
CRITICALITY AND IF A BATCH

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:09.997
OF -- E. A LARGE DIDN'T GET

01:41:10.063 --> 01:41:11.899
PROCESS FOR SOME REASON -- THE

01:41:11.965 --> 01:41:13.434
COUNTY'S NEW THAT DAY AND WERE

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.469
TALKING TO US AND SO WE HAD

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:18.272
TO THEN IMPLEMENT A GREATER --

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:20.874
-- SORT OF VALIDATION ON EVERY

01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:23.577
SINGLE DAY OF ALL THE MESSAGES

01:41:23.644 --> 01:41:25.379
ARE COMING AND TO KEEP UP

01:41:26.313 --> 01:41:27.948
TO ENSURE THAT THE COUNT

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:29.450
WAS ACCURATE FOR THAT DAY

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:32.052
SO WHEN THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:33.487
I MEAN WAS IT A SURPRISE

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:34.955
WHY DID WHY DID IT HAPPEN

01:41:35.022 --> 01:41:35.722
WHILE ARE WE READY FOR

01:41:35.789 --> 01:41:36.924
THIS I GUESS IS MY QUESTION

01:41:39.927 --> 01:41:42.763
SO ARM

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:45.265
I THINK WE KNEW THAT

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:46.667
THE LABORATORY TEST WE'RE

01:41:46.733 --> 01:41:49.136
GOING TO INCREASE --

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:51.104
DID WE PLAN FOR THEM TO GO

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:53.607
UP TEN TIMES SO PROBABLY

01:41:53.674 --> 01:41:55.542
NOT I THINK WHAT HAPPENED TO

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:57.177
CAUSE THIS IS THAT IT WAS A

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:58.612
COMBINATION OF A NUMBER OF

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:00.414
THINGS OR TWO OR THREE THINGS

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:02.616
THAT ACTUALLY HOSTAGE SITUATION

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:04.318
DE DUPLICATE MESSAGES THE

01:42:04.384 --> 01:42:06.220
BACKLOG BECAUSE OF THEM THE

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:07.921
CHANGES WE MADE TO OUR GATEWAY

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:10.057
TO TRY TO CATER FOR THAT --

01:42:10.123 --> 01:42:11.758
A SITUATION WHEN ON A NORMAL

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:12.726
WEEKEND WHERE THERE WAS A

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:15.295
PATCHING GOING ON -- THE SYSTEM

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:16.797
DIDN'T COME BACK UP TO THE

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:18.298
CONFIGURATION THERE A NUMBER

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:19.700
OF THINGS HAPPEN OVER THOSE TO

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:21.401
A THREE WEEK PERIOD IT CAUSED

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:23.003
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BACK LOCKED

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:25.672
AND AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE REACHED

01:42:25.739 --> 01:42:27.841
AND WE RESPONDED TO THAT ALSO

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:29.776
KNOWING THAT THE NUMBER OF THE

01:42:29.843 --> 01:42:31.178
LAB TESTS ARE GOING TO GO UP

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:32.713
SIGNIFICANTLY WE KNOW STARTING

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:34.882
NEXT MONTH SOME ADDITIONAL

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:37.251
-- TASK FROM PERKIN ELMER

01:42:37.518 --> 01:42:38.886
COULD BE AS MUCH AS FORTY FIFTY

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:40.220
THOUSAND BY THE END OF THE YEAR

01:42:40.287 --> 01:42:42.256
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MORE SO

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:43.757
WE HAVE JUST CONTINUE TO PUT

01:42:43.824 --> 01:42:45.425
RESOURCES IN TIME TO ENSURE THE

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:48.028
QUALITY SCALABILITY RELIABILITY

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:49.796

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:51.265
YEAR THAT'S AND I APPRECIATE

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:52.065
THAT AND I THINK SOME OF THE

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:53.300
STEPS ARE ENCOURAGING BUT

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:54.535
WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU DIDN'T

01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:56.970
EXPECT THE TEN FOLD INCREASE

01:42:57.571 --> 01:42:59.540
WHY NOT WHY WAS THAT SURPRISING

01:43:03.777 --> 01:43:06.146

WE DID QUICKLY REALIZED THAT

01:43:20.928 --> 01:43:23.297
I MEAN THE SAME SYSTEMS TODAY

01:43:23.363 --> 01:43:25.499
ARE IN PLACE THAT WERE THERE TWO

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:26.934
MONTHS THREE MONTHS AGO WE'VE

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.468
JUST PUT SIGNIFICANT EFFORT IN

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:31.371
IMPROVING -- THE PERFORMANCES

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:33.774
OF SYSTEMS BY -- DOING

MORE STAFF TO WORK ON THAT

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:42.883
I KNOW THAT A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:44.017
BEEN WORKING HARD TO MAKE THAT

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.619

GOVERNOR IN MARCH SAYING THAT UP

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:51.625
TO TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE COULD

01:43:51.692 --> 01:43:53.126
ULTIMATELY GET COBA NINETEEN

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.062
AND TELLING US ON A DAILY BASIS

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:56.129
THAT WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS

01:43:56.196 --> 01:43:57.898
OF YOUR DAILY LIVES ON THE

01:43:57.965 --> 01:44:00.500
BASIS OF THE DATA -- AND

01:44:00.567 --> 01:44:02.836
WHEN EVERYONE IS ACKNOWLEDGING

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:04.137
THAT THE EXISTING SYSTEM WAS

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:05.639
NOT BUILT TO HANDLE THIS SORT

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:06.707
OF VOLUME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:44:06.773 --> 01:44:08.609
AN URGENT PRIORITY TO MAKE SURE

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:11.378
THAT NO STONE IS LEFT UNTURNED

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:13.246
TO CREATE REDUNDANCIES WE WOULD

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:15.616
NEED TO ENSURE AN ACCURATE

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:17.117
FLOW OF DATA THAT WAS TO SERVE

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:18.352
AS THE BASIS OF THOSE DECISIONS

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:19.720
AND IT SEEMS THAT THAT DIDN'T

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:21.555
HAPPEN SO WELL I APPRECIATE

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:22.789
THE CORRECTIVE STEPS THAT ARE

01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:24.424
BEING TAKEN YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:44:24.491 --> 01:44:25.892
TO FIX THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:27.461
AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY A REACTIVE

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:29.329
POSTURE SO I WOULD SIMPLY

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:30.497
ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:31.865
TO TRY TO TAKE A MORE FOR LIKE

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:32.799
THE THINKING APPROACH TO TRY

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:34.001
TO ANTICIPATE PROBLEMS THAT

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.135
MIGHT COME UP AND SURE THAT WE

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:36.937
HAVE AT THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE

01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:38.605
THAT WE NEED AND THE LAST POINT

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:40.273
I JUST WANT TO RAISE IS ABOUT

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:42.442
THE COMMUNICATION OF THIS --

01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:44.678
INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC ACT

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:46.546

THE PROBLEM EVEN EARLIER --

01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:05.832
AND YET THREE DAYS LATER -- THE

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:08.301
GOVERNOR HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE

01:45:08.535 --> 01:45:10.704
AND TOUTED A DECLINE IN COVERT

01:45:10.771 --> 01:45:13.140
CASES -- ON THE BASIS OF THAT

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:15.409
INACCURATE DATA SO WHY IS IT

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.511
THAT SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:18.679

INFORMATION DID NOT FLOW UP IT

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:41.668
DID NOT PULL UP TO THE DIRECTOR

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:46.073
AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S

01:45:46.139 --> 01:45:48.108
A PROBLEM -- AND WE PUT IN A

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.576
LOT OF CONTROL MEASURES TO MAKE

01:45:49.643 --> 01:45:51.044

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:15.355
SPEAK ABOUT -- THAT JUST SO

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:16.623
THAT WE CAN HAVE CLARIFICATION

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:19.926
SURE SO JUST WHAT THE RULES

01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:21.261
ARE ABOUT IN SCHOOL STUDENTS

01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:23.029
ABSOLUTELY SO TO REITERATE

01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:25.899
AGAIN -- BASICALLY --

01:48:26.733 --> 01:48:29.236
WAS ONCE A COUNTY HAS ENTERED

01:48:29.302 --> 01:48:31.271
INTO THE RED HERE AND THERE IN

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:33.006
THAT READ HERE FOR TWO WEEKS

01:48:33.673 --> 01:48:35.375
IF THE ACCOUNT REMAINS STABLE

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:36.843
IN THAT TWO WEEKS AND YOU KNOW

01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:37.978
DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT'S GONNA

01:48:38.044 --> 01:48:39.613
RESTRICTION THAN THE SCHOOLS

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:41.147
COULD BEGIN TO RE OPEN AND AS

01:48:41.214 --> 01:48:42.916
YOU'RE SEEING I THINK MANY OF

01:48:42.983 --> 01:48:45.118
THOSE SCHOOL SYSTEMS SCHOOL

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:46.052
DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES ARE

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:47.387
STILL IF WITHIN THAT DECIDING TO

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:49.589
PHASE THAT RE OPENING OF THE

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:50.924
OTHER ISSUE I DIDN'T MENTION

01:48:50.991 --> 01:48:53.660
EARLIER IS THAT -- IN THE PURPLE

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:54.895
TEAR THE WIDE FOR TRANSITION

01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:56.329
TO HEAR AGAIN PRIORITIZING OUR

01:48:56.396 --> 01:48:57.831
YOUNGEST CHILDREN WHO WOULD KNOW

01:48:58.164 --> 01:49:00.467
-- YOU KNOW ARE HAVING THE

01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:01.601
HARDEST TIME WITH DISTANCE

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:04.304
LEARNING -- THAT COUNTY

01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:05.605
IS SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS GIVING

01:49:05.672 --> 01:49:07.841
AND -- SCHOOL LEADERS CAN SUBMIT

01:49:07.908 --> 01:49:09.509
A REQUEST FOR A WAIVER FOR

01:49:09.576 --> 01:49:11.378
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER THREE SIX

01:49:11.444 --> 01:49:13.113
GRADE THEY CAN SUBMIT A WAIVER

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.247
TO THEIR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

01:49:14.314 --> 01:49:16.216
AND THE OFFICER CAN WE GET THOSE

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:18.385
WAIVERS OFTEN SUSSING THE SCHOOL

01:49:18.451 --> 01:49:19.753
SAFETY PLAN THE SCHOOLS ACTUALLY

01:49:19.819 --> 01:49:21.454
NEED TO POST THAT SAFETY PLAN

01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:23.256
PUBLICLY SO THAT THEIR COMMUNITY

01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:24.958
CAN SEE THE SCHOOLS ALSO NEED

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:27.093
TO BE THERE THEIR TEACHER

01:49:28.194 --> 01:49:29.229
IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY AND SORT

01:49:29.296 --> 01:49:30.630
OF MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SUPPORT

01:49:30.997 --> 01:49:33.266
TO RE OPEN AND THEY APPLY THE

01:49:33.333 --> 01:49:34.501
HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S ASSESSMENT

01:49:34.567 --> 01:49:35.635
AND THEY ALSO CONSULT WITH US

01:49:35.702 --> 01:49:36.703
AT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT

01:49:37.103 --> 01:49:38.972
SO -- AS THE ACTING STATE HEALTH

01:49:39.039 --> 01:49:40.340
OFFICER IT'S AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST

01:49:40.407 --> 01:49:42.042
AYE YOU KNOW HOW WE KIND OF

01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:43.209
TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE AS WELL AND

01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:44.978
CONSULTED WE ANSWERED EXPRESSED

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:46.179
CONCERNS IF WE HAVE ANY ABOUT

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:47.847
THE SITUATION ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:49:47.914 --> 01:49:50.116
NOT SCHOOLS SO AGAIN IT'S TWO

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:51.918
WEEKS IN THE RED HERE AFTER THE

01:49:51.985 --> 01:49:53.687
TWO WEEKS SCHOOLS THREE OPEN

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:55.388
AND THEN SCHOOLS CAN APPLY FOR

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.891
A WAIVER IN THERE COUNTY --

01:49:57.958 --> 01:50:00.393
K. TWO SIX -- AND THAT AND THEN

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.329
WITHIN THAT IS THERE HAVE BEEN

01:50:02.395 --> 01:50:03.430
SITUATIONS ARE ACTUALLY JUST

01:50:03.496 --> 01:50:04.831
HIGHLIGHT WHERE THERE'S A REALLY

01:50:04.898 --> 01:50:06.166
HIGH DISEASE TRANSMISSION LEVEL

01:50:06.232 --> 01:50:08.568
AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THAT --

01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:09.903
IF THE DISEASE TRANSMISSION

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.705
IS OVER FOURTEEN PER CAPITA

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:13.006
FOURTEEN PER HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:14.874
CASES PER DAY IT'S ABOUT THAT

01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:16.009
WE REALLY DON'T RECOMMEND

01:50:16.076 --> 01:50:17.110
SCHOOLS RE OPENING AT THAT

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:18.611
POINT BUT ONCE YOU GET BELOW

01:50:18.678 --> 01:50:19.612
THAT THAT THERE COULD BE AN

01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:21.214
APPLICATION PROCESS FOR A WAIVER

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:22.882
AND I'M NOT ALLOWS THE LOCAL

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:23.917
HEALTH DEPARTMENT LOCAL HEALTH

01:50:23.984 --> 01:50:25.352
OFFICER TO ASSESS THE SAFETY

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:27.854
PLANS OF THE SCHOOLS THANK

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:29.889
YOU AND YOU KNOW I I DO WANT TO

01:50:29.956 --> 01:50:32.459
SAY -- THE THINGS ARE

01:50:32.525 --> 01:50:33.893
CONSTANTLY EVOLVING IT WAS

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.662
BACK ON MARCH SECOND THAT I

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:38.498
HAD A DOCTOR ANGEL HERE PRESENT

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:40.066
AND WORSE ABLE TO ASK HER

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:42.302
SOME QUESTIONS AND WANTS TO

01:50:42.369 --> 01:50:43.336
HIGHLIGHTS AND HER NAME WAS

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:45.238
BROUGHT UP EARLIER I BELIEVE HER

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.574
TO BE A CHAMPION FOR SOCIAL AND

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:49.209
RACIAL JUSTICE THAT TO REALLY

01:50:49.275 --> 01:50:51.578
STOOD UP AND SPOKE FOR MUCH

01:50:51.644 --> 01:50:53.513
OF OUR COMMUNITY AND HAS HELPED

01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.281
US TO ADDRESS HEALTH EQUITY IN A

01:50:55.348 --> 01:50:57.550
VERY MEANINGFUL WAY AND SO JUST

01:50:57.617 --> 01:50:59.552
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HER TIME HERE

01:50:59.619 --> 01:51:01.821
AND HER SERVICE TO OUR STATE AS

01:51:01.888 --> 01:51:02.989
SOMEONE WHO WAS LOOKING TOWARDS

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:04.824
THAT BUT IT'S IN THAT VEIN THAT

01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:06.693
I FEEL LIKE I MUST ASK IF WE

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.128
ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:10.196
SCHOOL RE OPENINGS SOME OF THE

01:51:10.263 --> 01:51:11.998
DISCREPANCIES THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:14.434
IN THE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND SO

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:16.369
I'M HOPING YOU CAN SPEAK TO IF

01:51:16.436 --> 01:51:17.570
YOU CAN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:19.739
TO GET LOST IN THE MY NEW SHOW

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:22.976
OF THE MOMENT AND NOT SEE

01:51:23.777 --> 01:51:26.446
WHICH PARTS OF OUR STATE

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:27.847
ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THIS

01:51:27.914 --> 01:51:29.916
VIRUS THE MOST AND SO I'M

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:31.885
HOPING IF YOU CAN TO TALK ABOUT

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:33.953
SPECIFICALLY CHILDREN WHAT

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:35.021
ARE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT

01:51:35.088 --> 01:51:36.256
WE'RE SEEING WITH THE STATE AND

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:37.724
ARE THERE HEALTH DISPARITIES

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.728
SO AND I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY

01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:42.729
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THAT

01:51:42.796 --> 01:51:45.231
AND -- THIS IS AN AREA I ALSO

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:46.900
HAVE A A LOT OF INTEREST AND I

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:49.002
WOULD SAY WHAT IS ENCOURAGING

01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:50.737
ABOUT CHILDREN AND PEDIATRIC

01:51:50.804 --> 01:51:52.305
CASES IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:53.239
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COVER

01:51:53.306 --> 01:51:54.574
NINETEEN AN IMPRACTICAL THE

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:56.876
NINETEEN IS THAT WE ARE SEEING

01:51:56.943 --> 01:51:58.378
MORE CHILDREN TEST POSITIVE

01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:00.780
BECAUSE MORE CHILDREN ARE --

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:02.482
HAVING YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:04.517
HAVING SYMPTOMS -- BUT IS STILL

01:52:04.584 --> 01:52:06.753
A MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION OF

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:08.288
CASES THAN THE PROPORTION OF

01:52:08.354 --> 01:52:10.223
KIDS IN THE POPULATION AND

01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:11.724
AMOUNTS ARE HOSPITALIZATIONS I

01:52:11.791 --> 01:52:13.626
BELIEVE IT IS STILL I WILL NEED

01:52:13.693 --> 01:52:15.095
TO CONFIRM THIS BUT I BELIEVE IT

01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:16.529
IS STILL LESS THAN ONE PERCENT

01:52:16.596 --> 01:52:18.264
OF OUR CASES ARE HOSPITAL'S

01:52:18.331 --> 01:52:20.633
CHILDREN'S SO OVERALL I THINK

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:22.669
AND -- DOCTRINA YOU MAY OR MAY

01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:23.837
NOT OF HEARD AS WELL THERE'S

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:24.904
THERE'S SOMETHING AREAS AROUND

01:52:24.971 --> 01:52:26.806
LIKE CHILDREN -- WHICH IS VERY

01:52:26.873 --> 01:52:28.141
DIFFERENT AND SLEW AS FAR AS

01:52:28.208 --> 01:52:29.909
RESTORATION IRISES THE CHILDREN

01:52:29.976 --> 01:52:31.244
DO NOT SEEM TO BE ESPECIALLY

01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:33.446
YOUNG CHILDREN SEEM TO BE

01:52:33.513 --> 01:52:36.216
-- ABLE TO NOT HAVE A SEVERE

01:52:36.282 --> 01:52:37.317
DISEASE NOT BE AFFECTED AS

01:52:37.383 --> 01:52:38.852
OFTEN AND OFTEN -- ARE NOT

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:40.120
TRANSMITTING TO OTHERS SO I

01:52:40.186 --> 01:52:41.354
THINK IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:43.356
TO TO KEEP IN CONSIDERATION AS

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:44.357
WE THINK ABOUT THIS AND THEN

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:45.725
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT WITH FLU

01:52:45.792 --> 01:52:47.260
AND FLU MODELING AND THE WHOLE

01:52:47.327 --> 01:52:48.695
REASONS BEHIND SCHOOL CLOSURES

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:50.463
WITH FLU OR THEIR KIDS COULD

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:51.598
BE DRIVERS OF TRANSMISSION

01:52:51.664 --> 01:52:53.066
AND OFTEN SPREADING TO OTHERS

01:52:53.433 --> 01:52:54.367
-- AND WE'RE SEEING LESS OF

01:52:54.434 --> 01:52:56.102
THAT YOUNG CHILDREN BUT AGAIN

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:57.437
THIS INFORMATION CHANGES EVERY

01:52:57.504 --> 01:52:58.638
DAY THERE'S SOME THOUGHT THAT

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:01.274
KIDS HAVE -- A SMALLER LEVEL

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:02.709
THESE RECEPTORS THAT VIRUS

01:53:02.775 --> 01:53:04.144
ENTERS YOUR BODY AND THAT'S

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:05.912
WHY THAT KIDS ARE NOT GETTING

01:53:05.979 --> 01:53:08.114
SICK -- I'D SAY THE OTHER

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:09.182
REALLY IMPORTANT PARAMETERS

01:53:09.249 --> 01:53:11.151
THAT WE'RE JUST STARTING TO --

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:13.386
TO LOOK AT AND THINK ABOUT AND

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:14.487
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE LEADING

01:53:14.554 --> 01:53:16.389
TO THIS IS WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:17.824
FOR KIDS NOT BEING IN SCHOOL AND

01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:19.926
MENTAL HEALTH AND TAX -- YOU

01:53:19.993 --> 01:53:21.194
KNOW WHAT A LEARNING IMPACTS OF

01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:22.462
THOSE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:23.630
WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AS

01:53:23.696 --> 01:53:25.465
WELL AND AGAIN CONTINUING LIKE

01:53:25.532 --> 01:53:26.933
OTHER THINGS OF THIS AND I'M

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.168
NOT TRYING TO BALANCE AND I DO

01:53:28.234 --> 01:53:29.769
WANNA ECHO THAT WE ABSOLUTELY

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:30.837
UNDERSTAND AND KNOW THAT THIS

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:32.238
IS VERY HARD AND EVERYONE IS

01:53:32.305 --> 01:53:34.407
HEARTED BUSINESSES IS JUST AGAIN

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:36.576
S. AS UNITS AT AN UNPRECEDENTED

01:53:36.643 --> 01:53:38.578
TIME A ONCE IN A CENTURY CITY

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:40.180
YOU ASIAN -- SO I THINK THERE

01:53:40.246 --> 01:53:42.348
ARE DEFINITELY -- HEALTH

01:53:42.415 --> 01:53:43.750
OUTCOMES FROM CHILDREN NOT BEING

01:53:43.816 --> 01:53:45.151
IN SCHOOL BOTH DEVELOPMENTALLY

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:46.386
AND WITH THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH

01:53:46.753 --> 01:53:48.488
AS WELL AS THE RISK OF DISEASE

01:53:48.555 --> 01:53:49.622
TRANSMISSION IN THE SETTINGS

01:53:49.689 --> 01:53:50.790
AND WE'RE CONTINUALLY TRYING

01:53:50.857 --> 01:53:52.358
TO BALANCE THAT AT ALL LEVELS

01:53:53.493 --> 01:53:54.894
HI I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IF I

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:56.996
COULD -- THAT IF WE LOOK

01:53:57.063 --> 01:53:59.532
AT OVERALL DATA WE SEE THAT

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:01.167
LATINO AND BLACK COMMUNITIES

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:02.602
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED

01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:04.771
BY COVERED NINETY EIGHT IF

01:54:04.837 --> 01:54:06.206
WE'RE LOOKING AT KIDS WHO

01:54:06.272 --> 01:54:08.208
ARE IN SCHOOL THE MAJORITY OF

01:54:08.274 --> 01:54:10.210
THOSE KIDS ARE LATINO AND SO

01:54:10.276 --> 01:54:12.412
BY CORRELATION WE COULD SAY THE

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:14.981
EFFECTS WILL BE BORNE BY THE

01:54:15.048 --> 01:54:17.050
BY MOST THE LATINO POPULATION

01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:19.185
AND SO I HAVE CONCERNS WHEN WE

01:54:19.252 --> 01:54:21.054
ARE STILL LEARNING THINGS ABOUT

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:23.056
THIS DISEASE ABOUT THE LONG TERM

01:54:23.122 --> 01:54:24.958
EFFECT THE LONG HAULERS IF YOU

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:27.126
WILL THOSE WHO CONTRACT THE

01:54:27.193 --> 01:54:29.229
DISEASE BUT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:54:29.295 --> 01:54:31.397
THE MANIFESTATIONS DOWNSTREAM

01:54:31.464 --> 01:54:33.533
THUS FAR AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.134

JURISDICTION OF THE STATE THAT

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.648
HOPEFULLY AT THE VERY LEAST

02:08:42.714 --> 02:08:44.516
-- BASED ON THAT COMMUNICATION

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:46.652
-- THERE BE THE HOPE THAT

02:08:46.852 --> 02:08:48.787
JURISDICTION WOULD RAISE ISSUES

02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:50.089
THAT THEY BELIEVED TO HAVE

02:08:50.289 --> 02:08:51.290

THE FEDERAL TESTING SITE THAT

02:09:08.373 --> 02:09:09.508

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:11.577

THERE ARE SITUATIONS AND THEN

02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:24.756
OUR TEAMS KIND OF WORK WITH

02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:26.291
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND AND THERE'S

02:09:26.358 --> 02:09:27.359
A WHOLE LAYER OF ISSUES THAT

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:28.327
COULD BE HAPPENING IT COULD BE

02:09:28.393 --> 02:09:30.662
THAT THE LAB IS NOT SUBMITTING

02:09:30.729 --> 02:09:31.663
IT COULD BE THE WAY THEY'RE

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:33.098
CALCULATING THE DATA WE HAVE

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:34.967

MATTER WHAT THERE'S ALWAYS

02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:49.014

WORKED ON THE FRONT LINES OF

02:09:52.584 --> 02:09:54.520
THE LOCAL LEVEL WE RECEIVE LOCAL

02:09:54.586 --> 02:09:55.521
GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE THE DATA

02:09:55.587 --> 02:09:57.890

02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:02.227
COMPLETELY TO OUR SYSTEM AND

02:10:02.294 --> 02:10:03.428
THEN GO TO THE LOCALS AND SOME

02:10:03.495 --> 02:10:04.429

WE ACTUALLY JUST RECENTLY DID

02:12:09.821 --> 02:12:11.089
A SURVEY OF ALL OF OUR HEALTH

02:12:11.156 --> 02:12:12.291
DEPARTMENTS AND I THINK THAT

02:12:12.357 --> 02:12:13.492
IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN A

02:12:13.558 --> 02:12:14.726
GREAT PARTNERSHIP IT ABSOLUTELY

IS A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:18.163
FRONTLINE ROLE THAT WE STOOD UP

02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:19.331
ACTUALLY ANOTHER I. T. SYSTEM

02:12:19.398 --> 02:12:20.565
WHICH WE ONLY TOUCHED ON TODAY

02:12:20.632 --> 02:12:22.334
BUT CAL CONNECT WAS STOOD UP

02:12:22.401 --> 02:12:23.769
VERY QUICKLY AND HAS BEEN VERY

02:12:23.835 --> 02:12:24.836
SUCCESSFUL IN THIS HAD LOCAL

02:12:24.903 --> 02:12:26.004
HEALTH DEPARTMENT INPUT FROM

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:27.839
THE VERY BEGINNING -- AND IT

02:12:27.906 --> 02:12:29.308
CONTINUES TO EVOLVE BASED ON

02:12:29.374 --> 02:12:31.576
THE USER NEEDS SO -- WE ARE

02:12:31.643 --> 02:12:32.778
REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE DATA

02:12:32.844 --> 02:12:33.845
THAT WE'RE SEEING AS FAR AS THE

02:12:34.279 --> 02:12:35.480
DEPARTMENT I THINK COLLECTIVELY

02:12:35.547 --> 02:12:37.082
WE DO HAVE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:38.250
DOING CASE OR CONTACTED THE

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:40.152
STATION ACROSS THE STATE NO THAT

02:12:40.218 --> 02:12:42.354
WAS A BIG GOAL EARLY ON -- WE'RE

02:12:42.421 --> 02:12:44.089
SEEING BETTER BETTER DATA ABOUT

02:12:44.156 --> 02:12:45.791

AND HOW MANY CONTACTS ARE BEING

02:12:47.059 --> 02:12:49.094
MET SO -- I THINK THERE'S A HUGE

02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:51.096
IMPROVEMENT IN THAT AND WE HAD

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:53.165
BEEN AIMING AS A STATE TWENTY

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:54.866
FIRST OF THAT UP TO BE AN ABOUT

THE LOVE WE ARE NOW TO BE ABLE

02:12:56.702 --> 02:12:58.837
TO DO CASE CONTACT STATION IT IS

02:12:58.904 --> 02:13:00.539
LOOKING LIKE WE ARE WE'RE HAVING

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:15.654
WE ARE NOT GETTING TO LEVELS

02:13:15.721 --> 02:13:16.555

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:30.001
ANTICIPATED AS WE GO INTO THE

02:13:30.068 --> 02:13:31.403
FLU SEASON AFTER GOING TO THE

02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:32.504
FALL IN THE WINTER THAT WE'LL

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:35.307
SEE ANOTHER WAVE JUST BECAUSE

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:37.809
OF THE -- OF THE WAY THE

02:13:37.876 --> 02:13:39.811
DISEASE GETS SPREAD AND JUST

02:13:39.878 --> 02:13:41.012
BASED ON THE WEATHER PATTERSON

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:43.315
YEAH THANKS I MEAN IT'S

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:44.816
OF COURSE A HUGE CONCERN

02:13:46.985 --> 02:13:49.087
I THINK ONE ENCOURAGING

02:13:49.154 --> 02:13:50.555
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO MONITOR

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:51.857
WITH CAUTION IS THAT WE'VE

02:13:51.923 --> 02:13:53.425
SEEN IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE

02:13:53.825 --> 02:13:54.893
-- YOU KNOW WE TYPICALLY IN

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.061
GENERAL IS LOOK AT THE SOUTHERN

02:13:56.128 --> 02:13:56.895
HEMISPHERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE

02:13:56.962 --> 02:13:58.230
THEIR CLUES IS NUMBER FOUR YEAH

02:13:58.296 --> 02:14:00.499
THAT -- AND THEY HAVE ACTUALLY

02:14:00.565 --> 02:14:02.267
HAD A VERY VERY MILD FLU SEASON

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:03.301
AND OF COURSE THE THEORY IS

02:14:03.368 --> 02:14:05.003
THAT EVERYONE'S WEARING MASKS

02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:06.438
OR PHYSICALLY DISTANCE I

02:14:06.505 --> 02:14:07.272
THINK THERE'S PROBABLY BETTER

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:09.007
COMPLIANCE OF THE COUNTRIES THAT

02:14:09.074 --> 02:14:10.175
THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING BACK

02:14:10.242 --> 02:14:12.644
FROM OF BUT IT IS A GREAT MAYBE

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.079
IF ALL OF OUR INTERVENTIONS

02:14:14.146 --> 02:14:15.547
CAN HELP US PREVENT FLU AND

02:14:15.614 --> 02:14:16.648
COVER NINETEEN AND THEY ARE

02:14:16.715 --> 02:14:18.216
TRANSMITTED A VERY SIMILAR WAYS

02:14:18.283 --> 02:14:20.452
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE -- AS

02:14:20.519 --> 02:14:21.720
YOU MANY OF YOU HAVE MENTIONED

02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:22.654
AS WELL IT'S TRUE THAT THERE'S

02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:23.989
OFTEN YOU KNOW A SECOND OR

02:14:24.055 --> 02:14:25.657
THIRD WAVE THAN A LOT OF THAT

02:14:25.724 --> 02:14:27.726
DEPENDS ON AGAIN HOW MUCH PEOPLE

02:14:27.793 --> 02:14:29.594
ARE INTERACTING AGAIN SO IT

02:14:29.661 --> 02:14:30.962
KIND OF CIRCLE BACK TO IF WE

02:14:31.029 --> 02:14:33.165
CAN MAINTAIN OUR -- YOU KNOW

02:14:33.231 --> 02:14:35.500
SLOW KIND OF MEASURED RESPONSE

02:14:35.567 --> 02:14:37.169
AND WATCH AFTER EVERY PHASE

02:14:37.235 --> 02:14:38.503
AND NOT LET THINGS GET OUT OF

02:14:38.570 --> 02:14:39.905
CONTROL WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

02:14:40.505 --> 02:14:42.340
TO MAKE IT BUT I THINK THAT

02:14:42.407 --> 02:14:43.508
IS A CONCERN OF WHY WE ARE

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:45.277
WATCHING ALL THESE METRICS

02:14:45.343 --> 02:14:46.745
INCLUDING HOSPITALIZATIONS

02:14:47.179 --> 02:14:48.113
HOME AND SEEING WHERE WE ARE

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:49.848
AND AND RUNNING PROJECTIONS

02:14:49.915 --> 02:14:51.450
YOU KNOW PERIODICALLY AS WELL

02:14:51.516 --> 02:14:53.852
TO SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE --

02:14:54.419 --> 02:14:56.188
BUT WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL IT ALL

02:14:56.254 --> 02:14:57.589
HAPPENED BUT I CERTAINLY OF

02:14:57.656 --> 02:14:58.457
COURSE CONCERNED ABOUT WE'RE

02:14:58.523 --> 02:14:59.758
SEEING ON THE WORLD AS WELL OR

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:01.092
EVEN OTHER STATES AS FAR AS YOU

02:15:01.159 --> 02:15:02.427
KNOW WE STARTED SINCE AGAIN AND

02:15:02.494 --> 02:15:03.728
I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT US AS A

02:15:03.795 --> 02:15:05.630
COMMUNITY BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN

02:15:05.697 --> 02:15:08.366
-- AGAIN THESE REALLY KEY ASKING

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:10.302
THE SCHOOL DISTANCING ACTUALLY

02:15:10.368 --> 02:15:11.336
WHILE I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:15:11.403 --> 02:15:12.437
JUST MENTIONED THERE'S MORE DATA

02:15:12.504 --> 02:15:14.873
TO MASKING NOT ONLY YOU KNOW

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.408
EARLY ON WE SET THEM ASKING WAS

02:15:16.475 --> 02:15:17.909
ONLY PROTECTING THE OTHER PERSON

02:15:17.976 --> 02:15:18.944
AND NOT YOURSELF THAT THERE'S

02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:21.246
MORE AND MORE DATA THAT ACTUALLY

02:15:21.546 --> 02:15:23.081
PROTECTS EVERYONE IT IT'S ALMOST

02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:25.217
LIKE ANOTHER VACCINE AND THAT

02:15:25.617 --> 02:15:26.852
THERE'S MORE DATA SAYING IT IF

02:15:26.918 --> 02:15:27.919
PEOPLE ARE WEARING MASKS THEY

02:15:27.986 --> 02:15:29.421
HAVE LESS SEVERE DISEASE TO

02:15:30.422 --> 02:15:32.224
SO IT CAN DECREASE AND IT MAKES

02:15:32.290 --> 02:15:33.959
SENSE -- DECREASED EXPOSURE

02:15:34.025 --> 02:15:35.126
EVEN IF YOU GET A LITTLE EXPOSE

02:15:35.193 --> 02:15:36.328
YOU MIGHT BE MORE LIKELY JUST

02:15:36.394 --> 02:15:38.096
HAVE NO SYMPTOMS OR NOT SIR

02:15:38.463 --> 02:15:40.565
SO IF WE CAN KEEP THIS UP AND

02:15:40.632 --> 02:15:42.767
REALLY EXPANDED THE COMPLIANCE

02:15:43.134 --> 02:15:44.669
WITH THE MEASURES THAT WE JUST

02:15:44.736 --> 02:15:46.505
YOU KNOW KEEP SAYING -- I THINK

02:15:46.571 --> 02:15:48.573
WE COULD WE COULD REALLY TRY TO

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:49.875
MITIGATE THIS AND NOT HAVE THAT

02:15:49.941 --> 02:15:51.176
WEIGHT BUT I THINK WE WE WON'T

02:15:51.243 --> 02:15:52.577
KNOW UNTIL WE SEE HOW THAT'S

02:15:52.644 --> 02:15:54.379
ALL THANK THANK YOU WELL LET'S

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:55.814
LET'S LET'S HOPE THAT PEOPLE

02:15:56.414 --> 02:15:58.250
ON SHORE FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS

02:15:58.316 --> 02:16:00.619
AND CONTINUE TO -- FOLLOW THE

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:01.786
GUIDELINES WILL HOPE FOR A

02:16:01.853 --> 02:16:04.022
VERY MILD WINTER IN A MILD FLU

02:16:04.089 --> 02:16:06.424
SEASON ON WHAT ONE OF THE

02:16:06.491 --> 02:16:08.159
BIG BIGGEST ISSUES AND ALL

02:16:08.226 --> 02:16:10.362
OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS SCHOOLS

02:16:10.428 --> 02:16:11.663
RE OPENING YOU MENTIONED

02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:13.999
THAT -- SCHOOLS MOVING INTO

02:16:14.065 --> 02:16:15.267
-- RED THE RED TERROR COULD

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:17.469
REOPEN ARE THERE ARE OTHER

02:16:17.536 --> 02:16:18.970
GUIDELINES OR PROTOCOLS THAT

02:16:19.037 --> 02:16:21.139
YOUR GIVING ADVICE TO DISTRICTS

02:16:21.206 --> 02:16:23.141
OBVIOUSLY THE CHALLENGES

02:16:23.208 --> 02:16:24.109
SCHOOLS AS YOU DON'T HAVE

02:16:24.175 --> 02:16:25.777
ONE JURISDICTION YOU HAVE

02:16:26.778 --> 02:16:28.647
THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:29.848
DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALL IN

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:31.182
CHARGE OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL

02:16:31.249 --> 02:16:33.218
SCHOOLS AND I'M SURE THEY ALL

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:35.253
HAVE A CERTAIN LIMITED CAPACITY

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:37.188
ABOUT EVEN UNDERSTANDING WHAT

02:16:37.255 --> 02:16:38.256
THEY SHOULD BE DOING HOW THEY

02:16:38.323 --> 02:16:40.926
SHOULD BE DOING IT IN SO --

02:16:41.626 --> 02:16:43.628
DO YOU SORT OF -- DETERRED

02:16:43.695 --> 02:16:45.797
APARTMENT SORT OF OFFER GUIDANCE

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:46.965
TO THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR

02:16:47.032 --> 02:16:48.967
IS IT JUST THAT COUNTY PUBLIC

02:16:49.034 --> 02:16:50.268
HEALTH OFFICERS THAT DOES THAT

02:16:50.335 --> 02:16:52.237
OR IS IT REALLY ARE YOU WORKING

02:16:52.304 --> 02:16:53.872
WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT JUST

02:16:53.939 --> 02:16:54.873
TRYING TO GET UNDERSTANDING

02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:55.974
OF LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT CAN WE

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:58.510
DO TO REALLY HELP GIVE SCHOOLS

02:16:58.577 --> 02:17:00.812
THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:03.214
PROPERLY AND SAFELY REOPEN

02:17:04.583 --> 02:17:06.351
SURE -- I THINK IT REALLY IS

02:17:06.418 --> 02:17:07.652
HAPPENING AT ALL LEVELS I'D SAY

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:09.421
ABSOLUTELY AT THE LOCAL HEALTH

02:17:09.487 --> 02:17:12.090
LEVEL I THINK BECAUSE -- ARE ALL

02:17:12.157 --> 02:17:13.258
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING

02:17:13.325 --> 02:17:14.526
VERY CLOSELY WITH THEIR LOCAL

02:17:14.593 --> 02:17:15.927
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEIR LOCAL

02:17:15.994 --> 02:17:18.063
SCHOOLS -- MANY OF THEM I THINK

02:17:18.129 --> 02:17:19.164
THEY'RE HAVING YOU KNOW WEEKLY

02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:20.632
CALLS TO UPDATE THEIR SCHOOLS

02:17:20.699 --> 02:17:21.866
ARE JUST THE LATEST ON WHAT'S

02:17:21.933 --> 02:17:23.068
GOING ON AT THE PANDEMIC AND

02:17:23.134 --> 02:17:25.437
ALSO ABOUT -- Q. AND A

02:17:25.503 --> 02:17:27.372
AT THE STATE THREE OPENINGS AND

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:28.573
THEN AT THE STATE LEVEL WE'VE

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:30.008

BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH CDA

02:17:32.644 --> 02:17:34.646
-- CTA AT THE STATE BOARD OF

02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:36.514
EDUCATION I THINK ANY TIME HAVE

02:17:36.581 --> 02:17:37.849
ANY GUIDANCE IT HAS TO DO WITH

02:17:37.916 --> 02:17:39.918
USE WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH

02:17:39.985 --> 02:17:41.753
THEM OF COURSE WITH WITHIN OUR

02:17:42.087 --> 02:17:43.688
AGENCY EVEN THE CDS US WITH

02:17:43.755 --> 02:17:44.956
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT CHILD CARE

02:17:45.023 --> 02:17:46.057
AND SCHOOLS AND MAKING SURE

02:17:46.124 --> 02:17:47.125
WERE YOU KNOW TAKING ALL THIS

02:17:47.192 --> 02:17:48.693
INTO ACCOUNT SO IF IT'S REALLY

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:49.828
HAPPENING AT ALL LEVELS WE'VE

02:17:49.894 --> 02:17:51.596
DONE SOME STATEWIDE WEBINARS

02:17:51.663 --> 02:17:53.331
-- FROM THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:54.499
PERSPECTIVE BUT I THINK A LOT

02:17:54.566 --> 02:17:55.600
OF THAT REALLY IMPORTANT WORK

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:56.501
IS HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL

02:17:56.568 --> 02:17:58.770
LEVEL AGAIN -- YOU KNOW AND

02:17:58.837 --> 02:17:59.771
TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT MANY OF YOU

02:17:59.838 --> 02:18:00.739
WERE SAYING AS WELL I THINK

02:18:00.805 --> 02:18:02.507
THERE'S SO MANY NUANCES AT

02:18:02.574 --> 02:18:03.441
THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY NEED TO

02:18:03.508 --> 02:18:05.677
BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT -- THAT

02:18:05.744 --> 02:18:07.245
ARE IMPORTANT TO FACTOR AND IS

02:18:07.312 --> 02:18:08.346
IT THINK ABOUT THE SAFETY OF

02:18:10.649 --> 02:18:12.684
GREAT THANK YOU -- I WAS

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:14.119
HOPING ASK A COUPLE OF THE

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:15.987
-- FOR THE I. T. QUESTIONS TO

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:18.289
YOUR CHAU OKAY THANK

AGAIN FOR PARTICIPATING SO SO

02:18:30.035 --> 02:18:31.803
HERE WE HEARD EARLIER THAT --

02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:34.506
THAT THE MANY ISSUES WITH THE

02:18:34.939 --> 02:18:37.475
-- SYSTEM WERE ONE --

02:18:37.542 --> 02:18:38.877
DUPLICATIONS FROM CERTAIN

02:18:38.943 --> 02:18:41.446
COUNTIES AND THEN ALSO THE LACK

02:18:41.513 --> 02:18:43.882
OF UPLOADING OF INFORMATION

02:18:43.948 --> 02:18:46.685
FROM QUESTIONS ON CORRECT

02:18:47.485 --> 02:18:49.254
AT THAT THAT IS CORRECT AT THEY

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:51.256
HAPPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY AT THE

02:18:51.322 --> 02:18:54.025
ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND -- YES

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:56.261
AND AT THIS POINT YOU FEEL LIKE

02:18:56.327 --> 02:18:58.930
YOU'VE WORKED OUT THE THE SYSTEM

02:18:58.997 --> 02:19:00.965
TO TAKE CARE OF THE DUPLICATIONS

02:19:01.032 --> 02:19:02.767
AS WELL AS -- AS WELL AS BE ABLE

02:19:02.834 --> 02:19:04.335
TO UPLOAD INFORMATION FROM QUEST

02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:07.505
ACTUALLY WE FIX THE QUESTION

02:19:07.572 --> 02:19:09.174
ONE FAIRLY QUICKLY WITHIN A

02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:10.875
FEW DAYS AFTER REALIZE THAT

02:19:11.342 --> 02:19:12.577
BUT THAT WAS ANOTHER HUNDRED

02:19:12.644 --> 02:19:14.979
THIRTY THOUSAND MESSAGES THAT

02:19:15.046 --> 02:19:16.147
WOULD HAVE COME IN OVER A FEW

02:19:16.214 --> 02:19:17.816
DAYS CAME IN ALL IN ONE DAY

02:19:18.216 --> 02:19:20.852
-- AND SO THE THAT WAS FIXED

02:19:20.919 --> 02:19:22.153
AND WE CERTAINLY KEEP TRACK

02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:23.922
OF THE DIFFERENT -- THAT HAS

02:19:23.988 --> 02:19:25.657
TO DO WITH SECURITY AS FAR

02:19:25.724 --> 02:19:27.792
AS THE CONNECTION SO I'LL WE

02:19:27.859 --> 02:19:29.360
HAVE MADE SURE THAT THAT'S

02:19:29.427 --> 02:19:31.496
NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN --

02:19:32.464 --> 02:19:34.666
BUT -- YES AND YOU

02:19:34.733 --> 02:19:35.967
KNOW I THINK AND IN GENERAL

02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:37.302
THAT THE INCIDENT THAT

02:19:37.368 --> 02:19:40.171
HAPPENED OBVIOUSLY WE BECAME

02:19:40.238 --> 02:19:42.540
VERY CONCERNED AND WE KNEW

02:19:42.607 --> 02:19:44.442
THAT FONG FOR GOING UP AND

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:46.377
WE STARTED TO SEE WHAT THE

02:19:46.444 --> 02:19:48.480
RAMIFICATIONS WERE OF US NOT

02:19:48.546 --> 02:19:50.682
MEETING -- WHAT WAS EXPECTED

02:19:50.749 --> 02:19:52.083
OF US AND WE HAVE DOUBLED AND

02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:53.918
TRIPLED THE WORK FORCE AND WE

02:19:53.985 --> 02:19:55.587
HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:57.522
AND WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE

02:19:57.589 --> 02:19:58.490
GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE

02:19:58.556 --> 02:20:00.391
LAST MONTH AND A HALF THAT WERE

02:20:00.458 --> 02:20:03.294
VERY WELL PREPARED WE OUGHT --

02:20:03.361 --> 02:20:05.463
HAVE ACTUALLY STARTED TO DIGITAL

02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:07.499
PROCESSES THE COVER THE SYSTEM

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.200
ITSELF IS PERFORMING VERY WELL

02:20:09.267 --> 02:20:11.636
TODAY YOU HAVE UPGRADES TO THAT

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:13.738
SYSTEM A THAT PROVIDE A MORE

02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:15.807
SCALABILITY AND MORE CAPACITY

02:20:15.874 --> 02:20:17.342
MORE PERFORMANCE THAT WE'RE

02:20:17.408 --> 02:20:18.810
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE VENDOR

02:20:18.877 --> 02:20:20.979
ON SAME WITH OUR H. I. GATEWAY

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:22.614
WE ARE LOOKING AT UPGRADES

02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.182
TO THAT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDE

02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:27.051
ENOUGH CAPACITY IS ABILITY

02:20:27.252 --> 02:20:28.653
TO ENSURE THAT OVER THE NEXT

02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:30.655
YEAR OR EVEN SIX MONTHS AT STAKE

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:32.223
WORKLOAD GOES UP SIGNIFICANTLY

02:20:32.290 --> 02:20:34.058
WE'RE READY FOR THE THANK YOU

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:36.694
HE IN IN MORE CONCERNING WHAT

02:20:36.761 --> 02:20:38.463
TO ME WAS THE DUPLICATIONS

02:20:38.530 --> 02:20:40.698
COMING IN FOR THE COUNTIES SO

02:20:40.765 --> 02:20:42.600
SO THAT HAS BEEN IRONED OUT

02:20:43.401 --> 02:20:45.570
SHE YES YES WE EVERY DAY WE

02:20:45.637 --> 02:20:46.471
KEEP TRACK OF THEM OUT OF

02:20:46.538 --> 02:20:49.007
DUPLICATES THAT COME IN --

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:51.843
IN TWO SEPARATE PROCESSES AND

02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:53.278
AND WHEN THEY -- EXCEED WHAT

02:20:53.344 --> 02:20:55.113
WOULD BE NORMAL DUPLICATIONS

02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:57.348
-- WE CONTACT THE COUNTY ISN'T

02:20:57.415 --> 02:20:59.884
TRYING TO -- TO REMEDIATE THAT

02:20:59.951 --> 02:21:01.820
ISSUE WHAT WAS THEIR REASON

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:03.488
TO COUNTY'S MISSED THAT TO

02:21:03.555 --> 02:21:04.556
PETITION BECAUSE I MENTIONED

02:21:04.622 --> 02:21:05.857
THE COUNTIES ARE TRACKING

02:21:06.558 --> 02:21:09.260
THE DATA AND FOR SOME REASON

02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:11.229
IF YOU DOUBLE COUNTED THE

02:21:11.296 --> 02:21:12.297
THEIR DATA HOW IS IT THAT

02:21:12.363 --> 02:21:13.698
BIG THEY MISSED IT AS WELL

02:21:15.533 --> 02:21:16.968
I WAS JUST SO MUCH WE DOUBLE

02:21:17.035 --> 02:21:18.403
COUNTED IT IT JUST TOOK A

02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:20.238
PROCESSING TIME SHOW -- THEY

02:21:20.305 --> 02:21:21.339
COME IN BATCHES FROM THE

02:21:21.406 --> 02:21:23.675
COUNTIES AND BATCHES OF HUNDREDS

02:21:23.741 --> 02:21:26.177
OF MESSAGES IS A CUME UP PUTTING

02:21:26.244 --> 02:21:28.446
HIM BACK AND THEY SEND TO US --

02:21:28.513 --> 02:21:30.949
IF AND SOME CASES IF THAT GETS

02:21:31.015 --> 02:21:32.517
DUPLICATED FOR SOME REASON THAT

02:21:32.584 --> 02:21:34.118
IS THE SAME SET OF MESSAGES

02:21:34.419 --> 02:21:35.653
THAT WE HAVE TO PROCESS ON

02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:37.522
THE FRONT END AND THAT'S WHAT

02:21:37.589 --> 02:21:38.823
STARTED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS

02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:40.558
WE WE CAN FIND DUPLICATE

02:21:40.625 --> 02:21:42.360
MESSAGES OVER A TWENTY FOUR HOUR

02:21:42.427 --> 02:21:44.262
PERIOD BUT WHEN THAT STARTED

02:21:44.329 --> 02:21:46.064
TO GET FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT

02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:47.632
DOWNSTREAM AND CAL READY

02:21:47.899 --> 02:21:50.501
WE UP THAT NUMBER TO

02:21:51.736 --> 02:21:53.771
A LOT LONGER WHICH COSTS AND

02:21:53.838 --> 02:21:55.406
ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW PERFORMANCE

02:21:55.473 --> 02:21:57.075
HIT ON OUR GATEWAY WHICH

02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:58.743
STARTED THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS

02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:02.714
-- GOT IT SO SO YOU'RE SAYING

02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:04.749
THAT THE COUNTY JUST GIVES

02:22:04.816 --> 02:22:06.384
YOU THE DATA THEY DON'T

02:22:06.818 --> 02:22:08.052
DO A TALLY ON THEIR OWN TO

02:22:08.119 --> 02:22:09.087
COMPLETELY RELYING ON THE

02:22:09.153 --> 02:22:11.022
STATE TO TALLY THE DATA

02:22:12.056 --> 02:22:14.058
SHE WELL THAT WHEN THE COUNTY

02:22:14.125 --> 02:22:16.194
SET UP AND AND ACTUALLY THE

02:22:16.261 --> 02:22:18.062
MESSAGES COMING FROM THE LACKS

02:22:18.129 --> 02:22:20.498
SO ITSELF QUEST'S LAB IS THE

02:22:20.565 --> 02:22:23.067
OTHER LAPSED EPIC THAT SENDS US

02:22:23.134 --> 02:22:25.336
THE LABORATORY MESSAGE RIGHT THE

02:22:25.403 --> 02:22:28.039
COUNTY SEE THOSE MESSAGES -- AS

02:22:28.106 --> 02:22:29.674
A FLOW THROUGH INTO CAL READY

02:22:29.874 --> 02:22:31.276
AND THEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO

02:22:31.342 --> 02:22:33.978
THEM IN THE CAR READY SYSTEM TO

02:22:34.045 --> 02:22:35.947
-- TO MANAGE AND MONITOR THOSE

02:22:36.014 --> 02:22:38.583
MESSAGES AND THEN -- THE COW

02:22:38.650 --> 02:22:40.184
READY DATA WAREHOUSES WHERE THEY

02:22:40.251 --> 02:22:42.353
HAVE DIRECT ACCESS ALSO TO DO

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.622
REPORTING AS OFTEN AS THEY WANT

02:22:44.689 --> 02:22:46.658
ON EXTRACTING DATA FROM THAT

02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:49.494
DEMAND THROUGH THE SYSTEM -- SO

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:52.563
-- THE COUNTY SEPT CELL SELDOM

02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:53.831
THERE ARE SOME CASES WHERE THE

02:22:53.898 --> 02:22:55.500
COUNTIES WILL GET INFORMATION

02:22:55.900 --> 02:22:58.469
-- MAYBE A HOSPITAL OR OR

02:22:58.536 --> 02:23:00.538
A OR A LAB DOESN'T HAVE THE

02:23:00.605 --> 02:23:02.507
TECHNOLOGY SO THEY'LL FAX IT

02:23:02.573 --> 02:23:04.175
TO THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTY

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:05.777
BUT WILL BE REQUIRED TO GET

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:07.078
INTO THE CAR IN THE SYSTEM

02:23:08.112 --> 02:23:09.747
I GOT I GOT A SERVICE WITH

02:23:09.814 --> 02:23:11.115
THE COUNTY SEE THE INFORMATION

02:23:11.182 --> 02:23:12.317
JUST LIKE YOUR YOUR TEAM

02:23:12.383 --> 02:23:13.351
MISSING THE INFORMATION IT'S

02:23:13.418 --> 02:23:15.086
IT'S NOT IT'S THE SAME PLACE

02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:17.755
RIGHT RIGHT THAT THE COUNTY TO

02:23:17.822 --> 02:23:18.990
THE LAB TO DO THE TESTING AND

02:23:19.057 --> 02:23:20.391
THEY SEND THEM TO US WE SAID

02:23:20.458 --> 02:23:21.526
THE LAB REPORTS THROUGH THE

02:23:21.592 --> 02:23:23.261
SYSTEM AND WE ROUTE THEM TO

02:23:23.328 --> 02:23:25.196
THE APPROPRIATE PLACES -- ONE

02:23:25.263 --> 02:23:26.564
OF THOSE HAS GOT READY ONE IS

02:23:26.631 --> 02:23:28.700
LA ONE IS SAN DIEGO AND THEY

02:23:28.766 --> 02:23:30.568
PROCESS THOSE INTO THEIR SYSTEMS

02:23:30.635 --> 02:23:31.970
AND THEN THEY SEE POSITIVE AND

02:23:32.036 --> 02:23:33.805
NEGATIVE RECORDS FOR CULVERT

02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:35.673
WOULD BE THE POSITIVE CASES A

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:37.875
POSITIVE CASES WITHIN CAL READY

02:23:37.942 --> 02:23:39.744
THEN END UP IN THE KHALKHIN ACT

02:23:39.811 --> 02:23:41.112
WHICH IS A CONTACT TRACING AND

02:23:41.179 --> 02:23:42.447
THEN THAT'S HOW THEY IDENTIFY

02:23:42.513 --> 02:23:43.581
POSITIVE CASES AND START

02:23:43.648 --> 02:23:45.083
WORKING ON IT SO HOW DO YOU

02:23:45.149 --> 02:23:46.417
DETER HARD HOW DO YOU ENSURE

02:23:46.484 --> 02:23:48.286
THE DE DUPING OF THE THE DATA

02:23:49.687 --> 02:23:52.357
WELL -- WE HAVE A DEVELOPING

02:23:52.423 --> 02:23:55.026
-- -- TECHNOLOGY WITHIN OUR

02:23:55.093 --> 02:23:57.895
GATEWAY -- BUT PART OF

02:23:57.962 --> 02:23:58.963
THAT ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR

02:23:59.030 --> 02:24:01.599
REQUIREMENTS FOR -- THIS

02:24:01.666 --> 02:24:03.167
-- CALIFORNIA OF CORPORATE

02:24:03.234 --> 02:24:04.402
REPORTING SYSTEM IS YOUR

02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:06.237
SYSTEM WHEN THE LABORATORY

02:24:06.304 --> 02:24:08.272
START REPORTING DIRECTLY TO

02:24:08.339 --> 02:24:10.375
THAT SYSTEM AND THAT'S RUN BY

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:13.678
OPTUM -- THEY WILL BE DOING

02:24:13.745 --> 02:24:15.847
-- LIKE WE'RE DOING BUT IT HAS

02:24:15.913 --> 02:24:17.749
A GREATER CAPACITY DE DUPING

02:24:18.082 --> 02:24:20.051
FORMAT CHECKING AND AND I'M

02:24:20.118 --> 02:24:21.786
I'M UP LISTING THE QUALITY

02:24:21.853 --> 02:24:23.888
OF THE MESSAGES BEFORE BEFORE

02:24:23.955 --> 02:24:25.023
THEY COME TO THE STATE AND THEN

02:24:25.089 --> 02:24:26.157
THEY WILL BE SENDING UP TO THE

02:24:26.224 --> 02:24:27.458
STATE WILL PROCESS HOW MUCH

02:24:27.525 --> 02:24:30.061
CLEANER D. DO MESSAGE AT AND

02:24:30.128 --> 02:24:31.262
THAT WILL GO TO THE SYSTEM SO

02:24:31.329 --> 02:24:32.764
IT'S OFF LOADING SOME OF THAT

02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:34.599
WORK ON THE NEW SYSTEM AND

02:24:34.665 --> 02:24:36.734
IT'S ALSO HAVING A DEDICATED

02:24:36.801 --> 02:24:38.269
RESOURCE TO LOOK AT THE QUALITY

02:24:38.336 --> 02:24:40.271
OF THAT DATA HAVE BEEN A BETTER

02:24:40.338 --> 02:24:42.373
METRICS AND ALSO HAVE MORE OUT

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:43.975
OF REACH BACK TO THE LABORATORY

02:24:44.042 --> 02:24:45.476
WHEN THINGS ARE NOT QUITE

02:24:45.543 --> 02:24:46.544
RIGHT WITH THE LADS EITHER

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:47.512
THEY'RE NOT SUBMITTING FOR

02:24:47.578 --> 02:24:50.281
SOME REASON OR LAS DUPLICATES

02:24:50.348 --> 02:24:51.816
OR OTHER REASONS THAT WE HAVE

02:24:51.883 --> 02:24:54.585
THIS WHOLE OTHER RESOURCE --

02:24:55.086 --> 02:24:57.221
OPTIM DEVOTING RESOURCES WITH

02:24:57.288 --> 02:24:59.257
DASHBOARDS AND ALMOST LAB

02:24:59.323 --> 02:25:01.192
SCORECARDS TRAFFIC THINGS IT

02:25:01.259 --> 02:25:02.560
ENDED THE DE DUPING SOFTWARE

02:25:02.627 --> 02:25:05.463
EXISTS TO BEFORE THE --

02:25:06.064 --> 02:25:07.265
BEFORE THE ERROR WAS DETERMINED

02:25:08.366 --> 02:25:11.369
YES YES YES SO

02:25:11.669 --> 02:25:13.838
IT IT HAD HAPPENED OVER TIME BUT

02:25:13.905 --> 02:25:15.506
NOT AT THE LEVEL THAT WE WERE

02:25:15.573 --> 02:25:17.642
SEEN AND BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME

02:25:17.708 --> 02:25:20.611
INCREASES IN REAL MESSAGES

02:25:20.678 --> 02:25:21.979
HOW READY STARTED TO GET

02:25:22.046 --> 02:25:23.514
BOGGED DOWN WITH THE ADDITIONAL

02:25:24.315 --> 02:25:26.317
MESSAGES THAT WERE VALID BUT

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:28.086
THEY ALSO HAVE TO PROCESS THAT

02:25:28.152 --> 02:25:30.555
THE -- DUPLICATE MESSAGES AND

02:25:30.621 --> 02:25:32.890
THEY ALSO TAKE TIME AND SO THE

02:25:32.957 --> 02:25:34.392
AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD WAS GOING

02:25:34.459 --> 02:25:35.927
UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND THEN THE

02:25:35.993 --> 02:25:37.962
BACKLOG STARTED TO KERN COUNTY

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:41.599
OKAY DOES NOT DONE THE

02:25:41.666 --> 02:25:43.401
NONE OF THAT EXPLAINS WHY

02:25:44.202 --> 02:25:46.637
YOU MISSED THE DUPLICATES

02:25:46.704 --> 02:25:48.973
SAUGUS -- JUST ON UNDERSTANDING

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.808
THE DE DUPING SOFTWARE THAT

02:25:50.875 --> 02:25:53.311
YOU USE NOW EXISTED BEFORE

02:25:53.377 --> 02:25:55.346
WHAT CHANGES TO THE SOFTWARE

02:25:55.413 --> 02:25:57.548
WERE MADE AND OR WHAT

02:25:57.982 --> 02:25:59.450
JUST TO YOUR SYSTEMS WERE MADE

02:26:01.052 --> 02:26:01.819
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ONLY

02:26:01.886 --> 02:26:02.887
CHANGE THAT WAS MADE IF YOU

02:26:02.954 --> 02:26:04.255
HAVE A VENDOR THAT'S LOOKING

02:26:04.322 --> 02:26:06.357
AT HIS DESK AT THAT THAT THEIR

02:26:06.424 --> 02:26:08.259
DATA MORE CAREFULLY THAT'S LIKE

02:26:08.326 --> 02:26:10.061
THE ONLY CHANGE THAT I FOR SO

02:26:10.128 --> 02:26:12.396
PERHAPS THAT SO THAT'S THE NEWS

02:26:12.463 --> 02:26:13.698
YOU SEE OUR SYSTEM THE CURRENT

02:26:13.764 --> 02:26:15.133
SYSTEM IS HACKED THE DUPING

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:17.902
ALL FOR YEARS IT WAS INSTALLED

02:26:17.969 --> 02:26:19.670
WITH THAT AND WE COULD IDENTIFY

02:26:19.737 --> 02:26:20.905
DUPLICATE RECORD WITHIN TWENTY

02:26:20.972 --> 02:26:23.474
FOUR HOURS AND SO NORMALLY

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:25.476
THAT WAS ADEQUATE AND HAVE SOME

02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:26.978
RECORDS WERE OLDER THAN THAT

02:26:27.044 --> 02:26:28.179
AND THEY GOT INTO THE CAR READY

02:26:28.246 --> 02:26:29.814
SYSTEM COUNTY WAS ABLE TO HANDLE

02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:32.550
THAT LOOK -- AS THE DUPLICATES

02:26:32.617 --> 02:26:34.585
ONE UP AND THE VOLUME WENT UP

02:26:34.652 --> 02:26:37.255
WE CHANGE THE H. ID GATEWAY

02:26:37.321 --> 02:26:40.124
SOFTWARE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY

02:26:40.191 --> 02:26:41.792
-- DUPLICATES OVER THREE MONTHS

02:26:42.593 --> 02:26:43.528
WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUGHT ALL

02:26:43.594 --> 02:26:44.996
THE DUPLICATES AND IT DID WORK

02:26:45.062 --> 02:26:47.331
FOR ABOUT A WEEK OR SO BUT THAT

02:26:47.398 --> 02:26:49.500
EXTRA WORK ON THE FRONT END

02:26:49.567 --> 02:26:52.170
THAT H. ID WHITE COSTA GATEWAY

02:26:52.503 --> 02:26:54.372
TO STE START TO HAPPEN FOR MUCH

02:26:54.438 --> 02:26:57.341
PROBLEMS OKAY VOEPEL

02:26:57.708 --> 02:26:58.743
THE BILL WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE

02:26:58.809 --> 02:27:00.745
ARBITRARY DEADLINE FOR THREE

02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:02.847
MONTHS ONE NOT TO SAY A ONE YEAR

02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:05.816
A ONE YEAR LOW BACK BECAUSE IT'S

02:27:05.883 --> 02:27:07.485
A IT'S A PIECE OF SOFTWARE IT'S

02:27:07.552 --> 02:27:09.554
NOT LIKE IT'S A HUMAN I AM STILL

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:10.488
TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS

02:27:10.555 --> 02:27:11.956
FILE FOR THIS NON HUMAN BEING

02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:14.659
SO RIGHT IT IS THE KEY ISSUE

02:27:14.859 --> 02:27:16.027
IS CHANGING A LOT OF CODE

02:27:16.727 --> 02:27:18.129
YEAH RIGHT TO THE ISSUE BECAME

02:27:18.196 --> 02:27:19.897
WITH THE VOLUME AND THAT AN

02:27:19.964 --> 02:27:20.898
AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK TO

02:27:20.965 --> 02:27:22.099
FIND IF WE'RE DOING A HUNDRED

02:27:22.166 --> 02:27:23.935
THOUSAND MESSAGES A DAY AND

02:27:24.001 --> 02:27:25.269
YOU'RE DOING IT FOR NINETY DAYS

02:27:25.336 --> 02:27:26.971
AS THAT NINE MILLION RECORDS

02:27:27.038 --> 02:27:28.005
THAT ARE SITTING IN A FILE

02:27:28.072 --> 02:27:29.440
THAT EVERY SINGLE RECORD THAT

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:30.708
COMES IN YOU'RE TRYING TO MATCH

02:27:30.775 --> 02:27:32.743
AGAINST AND SO THE PERFORMANCE

02:27:32.810 --> 02:27:34.278
OF THE SYSTEM START TO SLOW

02:27:34.345 --> 02:27:36.547
DOWN DUE TO THE SIZE OF

02:27:36.614 --> 02:27:39.483
YOUR YARD DE DUPING SOFTWARE

02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:40.618
THAT YOU'RE TRUMPCARE AND

02:27:40.685 --> 02:27:41.719
DATABASE THAT YOU'RE TRYING

02:27:41.786 --> 02:27:43.454
TO COMPARE TO GETS EITHER PASS

02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:45.690
IT THROUGH THE SYSTEM OR OR

02:27:45.923 --> 02:27:47.959
I DENY IT AS I DO BUT BECAUSE HE

02:27:48.025 --> 02:27:49.460
WAS NOT A HARDWARE ISSUE THAT A

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:52.096
SOFTWARE ISSUE -- YEAH I GUESS

02:27:52.163 --> 02:27:54.365
INTO HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND

02:27:54.432 --> 02:27:56.133
AT THE TIME WE WERE AND HAND

02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:57.401
SINGLE HARDWARE AND SOFT NOT

02:27:57.468 --> 02:27:58.669
THE SOFTWARE BUT THE HARDWARE

02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:00.871
BUT IT -- IT IN ITSELF JUST DID

02:28:00.938 --> 02:28:02.306
NOT PROVE EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO

02:28:02.373 --> 02:28:04.308
IT AND AND WE WERE SEEING MORE

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:06.877
DUPES THAN WE SHOULD NORMALLY

02:28:06.944 --> 02:28:08.512
HAVE SEEN BUT BUT BUT THAT'S

02:28:08.579 --> 02:28:09.647
WHAT I'M TO UNDERSTAND IS

02:28:09.714 --> 02:28:10.982
LOOKING TO WIN OF A SOFTWARE

02:28:11.048 --> 02:28:13.951
ISSUE THERE'S LINES INCLUDED

02:28:14.018 --> 02:28:15.519
YOU GO CHANGE WHEN YOU'RE

02:28:15.586 --> 02:28:17.421
TALKING ABOUT A BACK LOG IN

02:28:17.488 --> 02:28:20.558
SPEED EITHER IT'S A LACK OF

02:28:21.459 --> 02:28:23.594
FOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:26.397
ARE -- DE DUPING THINGS

02:28:26.464 --> 02:28:27.365
BUT I NEVER HEARD YOU MENTION

02:28:27.431 --> 02:28:29.500
ANY PEOPLE IN THIS PROCESS OR

02:28:29.567 --> 02:28:31.402
IT'S A HARDWARE ISSUE BECAUSE

02:28:31.836 --> 02:28:34.238
THE SYSTEM IS SLOW DOWN

02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:35.806
AND THE PROCESSING SPEED

02:28:35.873 --> 02:28:37.475
CANNOT HANDLE THE NUMBER OF

02:28:37.541 --> 02:28:39.377
RECORDS SO I'M JUST TRYING TO

02:28:39.443 --> 02:28:41.612
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM

02:28:41.679 --> 02:28:43.047
BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T

02:28:44.382 --> 02:28:45.883
YOUR ANSWER DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:48.452
IT'S ALL THE PROBLEM SO WHAT

02:28:48.519 --> 02:28:49.387
SO HOW DID THE PROBLEM GETS

02:28:49.453 --> 02:28:51.088
SOLVED HOW IS THE PROBLEM

02:28:51.155 --> 02:28:52.623
SOLVED OR THE PROBLEM NOT

02:28:52.690 --> 02:28:55.459
SOLVED THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED

02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.395
AT FIRST STARTED WITH A LOT

02:28:57.662 --> 02:28:58.963
OF GUYS FROM ONE OF THE COUNTY

02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:00.531
ONE OF THE LAPSED AND SO THAT'S

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:02.366
NOT HAPPENING AS OFTEN THERE

02:29:02.433 --> 02:29:04.368
IS MORE HARDWARE CAPACITY THAT

02:29:04.435 --> 02:29:05.970
WE PUT ON THE GATEWAY WHICH

02:29:06.037 --> 02:29:07.705
IS DOING TO DO DEEPING DEEP

02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:09.507
EUROPEAN PROCESS TODAY AND

02:29:09.573 --> 02:29:10.675
WE'RE BACK TO THE TWENTY FOUR

02:29:10.741 --> 02:29:13.844
HOURS AND THUS THE INCREASE

02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:15.212
PERFORMANCE ON THE COW READY

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:17.982
SYSTEM WHICH WE EARLIER UP TO

02:29:18.049 --> 02:29:19.583
SIX TIMES FASTER DUE TO THE

02:29:19.850 --> 02:29:21.319
THE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE MADE

02:29:21.385 --> 02:29:23.587
TO THAT SYSTEM HARDWARE AND

02:29:23.654 --> 02:29:25.823
CONFIGURATION CHANGES HAS ALSO

02:29:25.890 --> 02:29:27.425
ALLOWED THE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEMS

02:29:27.491 --> 02:29:29.760
TO HANDLE SOME MORE DUPLICATES

02:29:29.827 --> 02:29:31.929
AT A MUCH FASTER RATE SO WE

02:29:31.996 --> 02:29:33.464
WENT FROM ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND

02:29:33.531 --> 02:29:35.199
MESSAGES PER HOUR AND CAR READY

02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:37.234
TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT

02:29:37.301 --> 02:29:39.303
IN ITSELF HAS ALLOWED ZERO

02:29:39.370 --> 02:29:41.906
BACKLOG AND THAT ARE SOME DUDE

02:29:41.972 --> 02:29:43.474
TO COME THROUGH BUT THEY'RE THAT

02:29:43.541 --> 02:29:44.809
THEY'RE MUCH EASIER TO ABLE TO

02:29:44.875 --> 02:29:46.610
HAVE A GREAT IT STILL DOESN'T

02:29:46.677 --> 02:29:47.812
FOR THEM AFTER THE HARDWARE

02:29:47.878 --> 02:29:49.814
AND THE SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS

02:29:50.448 --> 02:29:52.750
DO YOU NOW HAVE MORE INDIVIDUAL

02:29:52.817 --> 02:29:54.618
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING BACK AND

02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:56.220
CHECKING AND VERIFYING THAT

02:29:56.287 --> 02:29:58.622
DATA TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:29:58.689 --> 02:29:59.924
SOFTWARE DID MISS SOMETHING

02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:02.293
OR -- YOU KNOW THAT THE VENDOR

02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:04.095
DIDN'T DIDN'T MISS SOMETHING

02:30:05.663 --> 02:30:07.031
ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE TWO OR

02:30:07.098 --> 02:30:08.432
THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF

02:30:08.499 --> 02:30:10.468
STAFF WORKING AND WE HAVE MORE

02:30:10.534 --> 02:30:12.002
VENDOR INVOLVEMENT -- THAT'S

02:30:12.069 --> 02:30:13.237
FOR A LOT OF SKILLS JUST COME

02:30:13.304 --> 02:30:15.139
FROM WE DEVELOP THAT DUPLICATE

02:30:15.206 --> 02:30:16.674
METRIC SYSTEM THAT READS EVERY

02:30:16.741 --> 02:30:17.908
SINGLE MESSAGE YOU KNOW THE

02:30:17.975 --> 02:30:19.210
HUNDRED HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:21.045
THE COMING TODAY THEY THEY

02:30:21.112 --> 02:30:22.847
DO A SEPARATE -- METRICS AND

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:25.850
ANALYSIS OF ALL THE ALL THE LABS

02:30:25.916 --> 02:30:26.884
ARE THE BILL BECAUSE FROM THE

02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:29.053
LABS AND FORMAT FROM THE LAB

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:30.788
SO WE TAKE THOSE METRICS AND

02:30:30.855 --> 02:30:32.289
WE COMPARE HIM TO THE METRICS

02:30:32.356 --> 02:30:33.958
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR H. I.

02:30:34.024 --> 02:30:35.993
GATEWAY AND FROM THOSE METRICS

02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:37.395
TO WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW

02:30:37.461 --> 02:30:38.562
MANY MESSAGES SHE'S GOING TO

02:30:38.629 --> 02:30:40.364
CALL READY SO WE DO THIS EVERY

02:30:40.431 --> 02:30:42.500
SINGLE DAY THEY HAD OUT THERE

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:44.435
THERE'S SOME MINOR DISCREPANCIES

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:46.604
WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED I MEAN

02:30:47.037 --> 02:30:48.139
WHEN YOU TAKE METRICS YOU KNOW

02:30:48.205 --> 02:30:49.106
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT OVER

02:30:49.173 --> 02:30:51.108
TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD A BATCH

02:30:51.175 --> 02:30:52.410
OF FIVE THOUSAND MIGHT HAVE

02:30:52.476 --> 02:30:54.445
GOT IN OR OUT DUE TO THE TIMING

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:57.248
BUT WE WE BALANCE -- TWO

02:30:57.314 --> 02:30:59.150
IS TO A VERY MUCH SMALL LEVEL

02:30:59.216 --> 02:31:01.652
EVERY SINGLE DAY THANK YOU IN

02:31:01.719 --> 02:31:03.287
THE END YOUR AVAILABLE ONE WE

02:31:03.354 --> 02:31:04.588
REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD

02:31:04.655 --> 02:31:06.957
WORK OF YOUR DEPARTMENT BUT

02:31:07.024 --> 02:31:09.059
ALSO THE ENTIRE AGENCY THE AND

02:31:09.126 --> 02:31:10.995
THE REASON THAT YOU ARE RASKIN

02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:13.297
THESE QUESTIONS IN DEPTH

02:31:13.364 --> 02:31:15.566
WAY AS AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

02:31:15.633 --> 02:31:18.335
REITERATED -- THE DATA YOUR OF

02:31:18.402 --> 02:31:19.937
THE DATA THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE

02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:22.072
OF DRIVES THE COLOR CODES AND

02:31:22.139 --> 02:31:23.307
IT'S NOT THAT WE CARE THAT MUCH

02:31:23.374 --> 02:31:25.242
ABOUT COLORS BUT BEHIND EVERY

02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:27.211
COLOR IS A RESTAURANT IS A HAIR

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:30.147
SALON IS A SMALL BUSINESS

02:31:30.214 --> 02:31:32.249
ON A MAIN STREET AND THAT

02:31:32.316 --> 02:31:34.485
THEIR LIVES ARE FRANKLY IN

02:31:34.552 --> 02:31:37.588
YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS HANDS SO

02:31:37.922 --> 02:31:40.758
YOUR DATA WILL DRIVE

02:31:40.825 --> 02:31:42.560
THE COLOR CODES WITHIN EACH

02:31:42.626 --> 02:31:43.594
OF THOSE COUNTIES AND IT'S

02:31:43.661 --> 02:31:46.163
SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT --

02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:48.132
BECAUSE BASED ON BASED ON THAT

02:31:48.199 --> 02:31:49.934
INFORMATION REALLY THEIR THEIR

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.502
FATES ARE SORT OF IN YOUR HANDS

02:31:51.569 --> 02:31:53.737
WHICH IS WHY WE WANT TO HAVE

02:31:53.804 --> 02:31:55.139
THIS HEARING BUT ALSO REALLY

02:31:55.206 --> 02:31:57.975
UNDERSTAND ON THIS INFORMATION

02:31:58.042 --> 02:32:00.177
AND -- EFFICACY IN THE ACCURACY

02:32:00.244 --> 02:32:02.046
OF THE INFORMATION SO WE REALLY

02:32:02.446 --> 02:32:03.514
WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:04.682
THE HARD WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR

02:32:04.748 --> 02:32:07.418
TEAM HAVE DONE BUT I JUST

02:32:07.485 --> 02:32:09.553
WANTED TO TAKE A SECOND TO

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:11.522
RE ITERATE HOW IMPORTANT YOUR

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:14.024
DATA IS THIS IS NOT A ACADEMIC

02:32:14.091 --> 02:32:16.660
EXERCISE WE'RE NOT HERE -- IT

02:32:16.727 --> 02:32:18.829
OF BECAUSE OF -- SOME PAPER

02:32:18.896 --> 02:32:19.997
THAT GOT WRITTEN OR SOMETHING

02:32:20.064 --> 02:32:21.599
THAT THE THESE ARE AGAIN HE'S

02:32:21.665 --> 02:32:23.868
A PEOPLE'S LIVES THE LIVELIHOOD

02:32:24.268 --> 02:32:25.836
-- ARE BEING SIGNIFICANTLY

02:32:25.903 --> 02:32:27.805
IMPACTED BY THIS PANDEMIC AND

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:29.907
AGAIN IF IF WE CAN ENCOURAGE

02:32:29.974 --> 02:32:31.375
THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING

02:32:31.709 --> 02:32:33.344
THE HOPE IS THAT WE CAN SLOWLY

02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:35.379
MOVE TOWARDS -- OPENING UP

02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:37.448
IN A SAFE IN A SAFE WAY AND

02:32:37.515 --> 02:32:38.916
YOUR DATA IS REALLY THAT

02:32:38.983 --> 02:32:41.485
THE LINCHPIN OF OF THAT OF

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:44.421
THAT -- MOVEMENT SO ON

02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:47.424
ONE EIGHT THERE'S NOT A

02:32:47.491 --> 02:32:48.492
PERSON ON MY STAFF THAT DOES

02:32:48.559 --> 02:32:50.628
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT WE WE

02:32:50.694 --> 02:32:52.563
TOTALLY AGREE WE WORK AROUND

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:54.498
THE CLOCK TO FIX THE SYSTEM AND

02:32:54.565 --> 02:32:56.000
TO GIVE THEM UP AND WE ARE VERY

02:32:56.066 --> 02:32:57.768
UNDERSTANDING AND AND I THINK

02:32:57.835 --> 02:32:59.069
BECAUSE EACH ONE OF US WANT TO

02:32:59.136 --> 02:33:00.404
GO TO RESTAURANTS HEATH ONCE

02:33:00.471 --> 02:33:02.473
ONCE YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND WE

02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:04.241
SEE THAT THEY'RE NOT FUNCTIONING

02:33:04.308 --> 02:33:05.910
AND WE KNOW THAT THE DATA COMING

02:33:05.976 --> 02:33:07.645
OUT OF THESE TWO PRIMARY SYSTEMS

02:33:07.711 --> 02:33:09.413
AND OTHERS AROUND IT AFFECT

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:10.881
THE COLOR CODING AND AFFECT

02:33:10.948 --> 02:33:12.816
WHAT CAN OPEN WHAT CAN OPEN AND

02:33:12.883 --> 02:33:14.985
WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE AND AND

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:17.655

MY TEAM WE RELOCATE PEOPLE

02:33:21.592 --> 02:33:23.928
ALL THE TIME WE BACKFILL AND

02:33:23.994 --> 02:33:25.062
WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO TRAIN

02:33:25.129 --> 02:33:26.230
PEOPLE TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:33:26.297 --> 02:33:28.666
SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONING AT AT

02:33:29.133 --> 02:33:30.968
THE HIGHEST CAPACITY POSSIBLE

02:33:31.402 --> 02:33:32.336
THANK YOU AND MAY I PLEASE
