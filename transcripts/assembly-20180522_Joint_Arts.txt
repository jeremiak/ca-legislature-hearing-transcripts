AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO WELCOME OUR AUGUST VICE CHAIR KANSEN CHU SOME OF THE CANCER KANSEN CHU WHO'S HERE HE ALSO CHAIRS. THE COMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES ARTS ISSUES ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AND I SPENT A GREAT PARTNER AT THIS. JOINT COMMITTEE. AND I WANT TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK TODAY SPEAKERS AND MANY OF WHOM ARE VETERANS WERE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR TESTIMONY TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE QUESTION OF VETERANS IN THE ARTS. AND HEALING LIVES THROUGH CREATIVE EXPRESSION. HOW WHICH WILL WILL BE TALKING ABOUT? A AND IN THE SECOND BUT I'D FIRST ONE I THINK MEMBERS REPUBLICAN JOINEDUS HERE IN THE CAPITAL ALSO THOSE WHO ARE HEARING THEY. THAT THIS THIS SIZE MISINFORMATION HEARING ONLINE THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND IN A SERIES OF TO ARTS HEARINGS THAT ARE COMMITTEE THE JOINT IN THE ARTS IS HELD OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS. AND I CERTAINLY VERY MUCH THINK LAUREN UP PIES REMAINS ARE FANTASTIC. CONSULTANT WHO HAS WORKED REALLY HARD TO PULL TOGETHER TO REALLY TOP NOTCH HEARINGS LAST WEEK AS YOU. MAY RECALL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA THE HUMANITIES AND. AND AND BRING UP ALL SORTS OF WONDERFUL STORIES FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. THAT. ARE IN THE SPACE OF HUMANITIES. AND THEN TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT VETERANS ISSUES FOCUSING ON AN IMPORTANT POPULATION IN OUR STATE THAT DESERVES OUR DAILY APPRECIATION AND OUR UNWAVERING SUPPORT. OUR VETERANS AND TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS WILL EXAMINE. THAT MANY PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT SEEK TO SUPPORT OUR VETERANS BY MARRYING THE HEALING POWER OF THE ARTS. WITH THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO REALLY SERVED OUR COUNTRY. IN A FEW QUESTIONS AND OF COURSE IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT HERE WE ARE JUST A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE MEMORIAL DAY. ONE WERE ASKED TO REFLECT ON THE SACRIFICE. THAT THOSE WHO SERVED. HOA HAVE GIVEN TO OUR COUNTRY SO THERE'S A FEW QUESTIONS AT THIS HEARING ARE GETTING US TO THINK ABOUT SUFFERS A HOW DO WE DEFINE HEALING. WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT MEAN TO BE HEALED? I THINK WE WANT TO USE THE TERM SHIELD WE MUST USE IT RESPECTFULLY BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT HE ONLY HAPPEN STEP BY STEP IN. OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOR MANY OF OUR TO PLAY VETERANS THEIR WOUNDS BOTH PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL. THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO COMPLETELY HEAL. HOW THEY SURVIVE SUCH TRAUMA HOWEVER HEALING IS A JOURNEY OF PROGRESSION ON THE PATH TOWARDS A BETTER PLACE IN WITHOUT THERE'S HOPE? I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL LEARN TODAY ABOUT ARTS PROGRAMS THAT ARE CREATING HOPE AND HEALING PATHWAYS FOR OUR VETERANS. SPEAKERS WILL SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT ARTS PROJECTS OR THERAPIES THAT ARE SUPPLEMENTING OTHER MEDICAL PROTOCOLS. OR THOSE THAT HAVE SHOWN UNIQUE ABILITIES TO SOOTH DAMAGE SPIRITS AND MINES. POUND MORE SOME OTHER FORMS OF OF. OF THERAPY THAT ARE ENCOURAGING MOVEMENT THROUGH DANCE AND FEAR OR THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE CREATING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND LESSEN ISOLATION AND LONELINESS BY CREATING. ART IN A GROUP SETTING. THESE BENEFITS ARE POWERFUL THEY'RE IMPORTANT AND THEY'LL DEMONSTRATE THE UNIQUE SPACE OF THE ARTS OCCUPY AND VETERANS. AND RECOVERY HOW OFTEN AND WELL BEING. TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT BY THE U. S. OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE PREVENTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. THE HIGHER RATE OF SUICIDE AMONG VETERANS THAN. AMONG THE NON VETERAN POPULATION I KNOW THAT.

I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES ON HOW ARTS THERAPY HAS HELPED THEM FITTING TESTED REALLY REALLY GOOD TESTIMONY. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I MEAN TO STATE AND LEARNING HOW CALIFORNIA CAN PASS USE ALL OUR RESOURCES TO CALIFORNIA ARTS. COUNCIL THOUGH I IT DVDS HERE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR VETERANS WHAT'S SAD AGAIN THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER. AND DUH THE FAULT WITNESSES WHO COME FORWARD TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. THANK YOU AS A VICE CHAIR. TO COVER PANELS WE NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM PRINT OVER WILL HAVE AN OVERVIEW WHERE WE WILL FEATURE. THE AGENCY LEADERS CAPITA MEMBER INSECTIVOROUS AFFAIRS. THE DUMBASS YUMMY HI WELCOME TO THE DIETS AND ALSO COVERED ARTS COUNCIL DIRECTOR AND BROWN CLUB CRAWFORD WHO WILL GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THEIR DEPARTMENTS ARE PERSPECTIVES. ON THE VALUE VETERANS ARTS PROGRAMS IN GENERAL AND THEN WILL DRILL DOWN ON HOW WE'RE WORKING. AGENCIES. IN SUPPORT OF THE ARTS COUNCILS VETERANS IN ARTS PROGRAM. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE HEARING FROM GENERAL NOLAN BILLIONS. I HE CURRENTLY SERVES AS MILITARY IN ARTS COMMUNICATE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ADVISOR FOR A NATIONAL PROGRAM THE CREATIVE FORCES INITIATIVE. WHICH IS A COLLABORATION OF THE NATIONAL DOLLARS FOR THE ARTS AND OUR NEW DEFENSE SO WE'LL BE HEARING FROM. BOTH A STATEMENT FOR THE FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE AND WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME IS REVEALED TO. THE FRONT OF MY PRESENTS OR COMMITTEE. WE'LL START WITH YOU DOCTOR MUST. AND ALWAYS WEARS IMPECCABLE CHO TIES. I THINK IT'S JUST. WHAT MORE NECESSITY? AS A SURGEON THAT AS A FASHION STATEMENT. BUT I GOVERNOR'S CHAIRMAN NOW AND AM VICE SO TERRIBLY ONE HAVE TO PERFORM SURGERY TODAY. ABOUT OPEN UP TO. AND. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT VETERANS IN THE ARTS ONE OF THE FIFTEEN GRANT PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. YOU GET UP ABOUT MY CREDENTIALS AND WHY I SHOULD SPEAK AT ALL TO YOU TODAY. IT'S TRUE I DID SPEND MUCH OF MY CAREER IN THE MILITARY AS AN ARMY PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON. BUT BEFORE THAT I STARTED IN ACADEMIA. I RECEIVED MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN MUSIC. AT NEW YORK'S STATE UNIVERSITY AT FREDONIA NEAR BUFFALO NEW YORK I EARN MY MASTERS DEGREE AND A PHD IN MUSICOLOGY FROM CORNELL. AND I TAUGHT MUSIC HISTORY AND HUMANITIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. AND AT MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE IN VERMONT WHERE I ALSO HAD OCCASION TO WORK WITH THE VERMONT COUNCIL ON THE ARTS. NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF THE ARTS. TEACHING MUSIC AT SEVERAL TWO AND FOUR YEAR COLLEGES REINFORCED MY BELIEF IN THE VALUE OF THE ARTS. PARTICULARLY IN ITS ROLE IN LIBERAL EDUCATION AS IT SEEKS TO SHAPE AND FORM CITIZENS. THERE'S INHERENT VALUE IN CULTURAL ENRICHMENT AND EXPOSURE TO THE ARTS AND AS YOU WILL NO DOUBT HEAR TODAY THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. THERE'S THERAPEUTIC VALUE ESPECIALLY WHEN ART PROGRAMS ARE PART OF A BROADER WRAPAROUND SERVICE. SERVICES FOR VETERANS REINTEGRATING INTO CIVILIAN LIFE. THE ARTS CAN PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE MODES OF THERAPY AND CULTURAL ENRICHMENT FOR VETERANS. AND THEIR FAMILIES. MANY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE FEDERAL VA HAVE BEGUN OFFERING ARTS THERAPY AS A MEANS TO COMPLEMENT ESTABLISHED TREATMENT PLANS FOR PTSD AND TB AYE. INJURIES WHICH ARE BECOMING A DISTRESSINGLY MORE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MODERN BATTLEFIELD. THESE PROGRAMS FOCUS ON DEVELOPING SELF EXPRESSION SELF KNOWLEDGE AND RELAXATION. OFTEN IN THE COMFORT OF THE VETERANS OWN HOME. SPEAKERS FOLLOWING ME WILL AMPLIFY AND PERSONALIZE THESE POINTS IN A FAR MORE CONVINCING VOICE THAN I CAN. BUT LET ME SAY THIS. NO PLACE NEEDS THE SUPPORT OF THE ARTS AS MUCH AS CALIFORNIA DIES. BECAUSE WE ARE UNIQUE. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE NATION'S LARGEST VETERAN POPULATION WITH ROUGHLY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION VETERANS. HALF OF OUR VETERANS ARE OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE. TEN PERCENT ARE UNDER AGE THIRTY. AND A QUARTER OF OUR VETERANS ARE DISABLED BY THEIR SERVICE TO SOME DEGREE. A QUARTER OF THEM HAVE NO MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION AND THEIR MILITARY TRAINING. BUT YOU'RE AWARE THERE ARE CHALLENGES AMONG OUR NATIONS AND OUR STATES VETERAN POPULATION INCLUDING PTSD. TBI. VETERAN SUICIDE HOMELESSNESS AND OVER REPRESENTATION IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS. WELL WE CALIFORNIA HAVE TEN PERCENT OF THE NATION'S VETERANS WE HAVE TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF ALL HOMELESS VETERANS. FORTY NINE PERCENT OF THE NATION'S ON SHELTERED VETERANS RESIDE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FORTY NINE PERCENT. WITH SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS% HELPING TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AND SERVING VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA THE IMPORTANCE OF A COORDINATED STRATEGIC APPROACH TO PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO SERVICE MEMBERS VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. SO LET ME TAKE A MOMENT TO DESCRIBE A NEW PROGRAM WITHIN CAL THAT. THAT IS POSITIONED TO FURTHER THE REACH AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ARTS COUNCILS VETERANS IN THE ARTS PROGRAM. LAST YEAR THANKS TO THE VISION OF OUR GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WE LAUNCHED THE CALIFORNIA TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR CAL TAP. THE FIRST OF ITS KIND STATE PROGRAM EDUCATE SERVICE MEMBERS VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES ABOUT THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE LEARNED THROUGH THEIR MILITARY SERVICE. NO EVERY YEAR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE HANG UP THEIR UNIFORMS SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD AND COME O CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM THE MILITARY TO CIVILIAN LIFE. AND CAL TAP IS DESIGNED TO CONNECT WITH ALL OF THESE VETERANS. RIGHT WHEN THEY ARE SEPARATING FOR SERVICE AND TO STAY CONNECTED WITH THEM FOR LIFE. WE ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING CAL TAP SEMINARS ON ALL THIRTEEN ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY INSTALLATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WERE USING AN INNOVATIVE THREE STEP STRATEGY TO CONNECT CONTACT AND COMMUNICATE WITH VETERANS IN A NEW WAY. AND THIS CONSISTS OF IN PERSON AND ONLINE CLASSES THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO DATA DRIVEN ANALYSIS OF WHAT VETERANS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE. WITH DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND AT DIFFERENT STAGES IN THEIR LIFE WHAT THEY REALLY NEED WE PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT'S SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA. THE COUNTER PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SERVING VETERANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SUCH AS THE VETERANS IN THE ARTS PROGRAM. THROUGH CAL TAP. WE COULD HELP SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES AND INCORPORATE GRANTEES INTO OUR TRAINING PROGRAM WHEN APPROPRIATE. WE CAN ALSO ASSIST THE ARTS COUNCIL IN NAVIGATING THE NUANCES OF REACHING ARE TRANSITIONING SERVICE MEMBERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SO I WANT TO THANK THE ARTS COUNCIL FOR INCLUDING CAL THAT IN THEIR PROCESS HE'S TO DATE. HARD TEAM WAS INVOLVED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GRANT PROCESS FOR VETERANS IN THE ARTS. HELPING TO REVIEW NEARLY FIFTY PROPOSALS REPRESENTING A RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. IN MANY CASES THE APPLICANT'S WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ESTABLISHED VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT'S KIND OF COLLABORATION PROVIDES A MECHANISM TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY VETERANS. WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM? AND TO VERIFY THAT THESE PROGRAMS HAVE THE NECESSARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACKERMAN. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ARE MOST DESERVING VETERANS RECEIVE AN ARTS PROGRAM EXPERIENCE THAT WORKS IN CONCERT WITH TREATMENT PLANTS ALREADY ESTABLISHED THROUGH EVIDENCE BASED MEANS. I BELIEVE THESE TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS ALONG WITH IMMIGRATION WITH EXISTING SERVICES PROVIDES THE GREATEST PROMISE FOR EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC ARTS PROGRAMS. AND THIS WILL ENSURE THAT WE SERVE VETERANS IN NEED AND THAT SUCH PROGRAMS ARE HIGH QUALITY RESULTS FOCUSED AND PROVIDE MAXIMUM IMPACT. THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL THROUGH THEIR VETERANS IN THE ARTS PROGRAM IS ONE SPOKE IN THE WHEEL OF PROVIDING COORDINATED SERVICES TO VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. TOGETHER. WE CAN WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS OF VETERANS ARE PRIORITIZED IN A WAY. THAT PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE AND HOLISTIC CARE WHILE MAINTAINING EFFICACY. SO FINALLY I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT OUR STATE KEEPS ITS PROMISE TO THOSE WHO SERVE ON OUR BEHALF THANK YOU. JEFF. BUSINESS FROM CRAWFORD. GOOD AFTERNOON. NICE ADDITION OF THE TIE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW WE KEEP AMERICA? REALLY THOUGH. BECAUSE OF HOW FROM TOP TO WEAR TIED TO STATE ON THE DATA. OKAY SO. WE'RE NOT TELL. HOW FAR BACK TO MY NOTES? HE'S BEEN ARTSY IN IS UNLIKELY I ONLY APPRECIATE NTULI. YEAH I'M GOOD AFTERNOON TO BOTH OF YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER VICE CHAIR THANKS FOR CONVENING THIS. HEARING TODAY WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND A FOUR YEAR COMMITMENT TO THOSE WHO SERVED THIS COUNTRY. YEAH I'M A FOR ALL YOU DO TO ENSURE THAT THEY ALONG WITH ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN BENEFIT FROM THE POWER OF CREATIVE EXPRESSION AND THE ARTS. I'M AND BOUND CRAWFORD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. I'M HONORED TO HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO THIS POSITION IN DECEMBER BY GOVERNOR BROWN WHO CREATED THE ARTS COUNCIL MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AGO. ON THE BASIS THAT THE ARTS ARE CENTRAL TO THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. WHERE THE STATE'S ARTS AGENCY DEDICATED TO ADVANCING CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE ARTS AND CREATIVITY? I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THAT MISSION I GET ASSET FREQUENTLY WHAT DO YOU DO. OUT WE ADVANCE CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE ARTS AND CREATIVITY. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE CANNOT TRULY ADVANCE AS A STATE AND AS A SOCIETY IF EVEN ONE INDIVIDUAL IS LEFT BEHIND. THE ARTS ARE UNIQUE TO ALL THAT BREAK DOWN BARRIERS THEY DEEPLY CONNECT PEOPLE AND ALLOW EVERYONE TO FIND THEIR OWN AUTHENTIC VOICE. A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF NATIONAL RESEARCH HAS ESTABLISHED THE ARMS ENGAGEMENT. AS YIELDING PHYSICAL COGNITIVE AND AN EMOTIONAL BENEFITS SUCH AS RECOVERY FROM INJURY ILLNESS AND IMPROVED INNER PERSONALITY. INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND OUTLOOK ON LIFE HISSES REFERENCED IN THE MATERIALS IN FRONT OF YOU. I'VE EXPERIENCE THE POWER OF THE ARTS FIRSTHAND AS AN EDUCATOR. TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FOR FOUR DECADES. STARTING IN THE BAY AREA AND ENDING UP IN THE NORTHERN MOST VERY RURAL PART OF THE STATE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. I KNOW THAT THE ARTS HAVE THE POWER TO LAND PEOPLE AGENCY PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED OR ALIENATED. PEOPLE WHO CARRY WITH THEM PERSONAL STRUGGLE AND CHALLENGE. THE ARTS ARE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE SENSE OF ALIENATION AND FRAGMENTATION THIS OFTEN FOUND IN OUR CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY. BY NOURISHING CREATIVITY WE CAN BEST TO NOURISH HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND INFORM A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY. AT THE CORE OF OUR MISSION AT THE ARTS COUNCIL ISA BELIEVES THAT ARTS CULTURE AND CREATIVE EXPRESSION HAVE A DIRECT AND LASTING IMPACT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND THEIR COMMUNITIES GOVERNOR BROWN AND OUR STATE LEGISLATURE HAS REASSERTED THEIR FAITH IN THIS MISSION THROUGH A STEADY INCREASE IN OUR ITS INVESTMENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEE. FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN THE FIRST BUDGET INCREASE CAME TO OUR AGENCY THE COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY PRIORITIZED CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS. OUR COUNCIL DISCUSSED THE CHALLENGES AND REALITIES THAT DOCTOR EMBOSS YANNI'S JUST SPOKE OF. AND FELT A SPECIAL CALL TO IMPROVE THE LIVES AND AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF THIS UNIQUE AND VALUED CALIFORNIA POPULATION. OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES COULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM COMMUNITY ARTS PROGRAMMING. THEY IDENTIFIED MANY ASPECTS OF THE VETERAN EXPERIENCE THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ARTS INCLUDING FAMILY RELATIONS. CIVILIAN AND SOCIAL REINTEGRATION EMPLOYMENT HOMELESSNESS MULTIPLE DEPLOYMENT ASPECTS COMBAT RELATED MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES. THROUGH MY OWN PERSONAL STORY I CONNECT TO THE ARE. TO THE ARTS IN WAYS THAT ADDRESS THE VETERAN EXPERIENCE. I WAS BORN ON THAT KODIAK NAVAL AIR BASE AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH AND WATCH MY FATHER CREATE ONE CREATIVE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE AFTER ANOTHER. THROUGH HIS MILITARY IN PUBLIC SERVICE. ALL INVOLVED CONNECTION AND HEALING. I'VE MENTORED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN NAVIGATING TOWARDS THEIR FUTURE MANY WHO CHOOSE TO ENLIST. THE STUDENTS OFTEN COME TO THE ARTS WHEN THEY HAVEN'T FELT CONNECTED TO ANY OTHER PART OF HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE GREATER COMMUNITY. IN THE ARTS THEY FIND A COMMUNITY WHERE THEY ARE VALUED. FOR MANY CONSIDERING MILITARY SERVICE IS A NATURAL SEGUE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE AND BE PART OF A GREATER COMMUNITY. THE ARTS COUNCILS VETERANS IN THE ARTS PROGRAM WAS INTRODUCED AS A PILOT FOR YEARS AGO. THROUGH ARTS TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL ARTS AGENCIES AND VETERANS ASSISTANCE AGENCIES ARE BE AYE A PROGRAM SEEKS TO INCREASED EQUITY. ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR VETERANS TO PARTICIPATE IN QUALITY ARTS PROGRAMMING. THAT IS SENSITIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO THEIR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES. THE I AEA HAS IS ONE OF FIFTEEN GRANT PROGRAMS CURRENTLY OFFERED BY THE ARTS COUNCIL. NINETY FIVE GRANTS WERE AWARDED IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF OUR V. I. AID PROGRAM. EACH YEAR THE COUNCIL HAS INCREASED ITS INVESTMENT IN THIS PROGRAM BEGINNING WITH THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PILOT PROGRAM TO ANNOUNCE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT. IN THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. ON JUNE SEVENTH OUR COUNCIL WILL AWARD THE FOURTH YEAR OF V. I. EIGHT GRAMS. AS I GOT TO KNOW OUR VIP GRANTEES I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY THE CREATIVE AND INTEGRATED CONCEPTS FOR LOCAL PROGRAMS. I WAS INSPIRED BY THE APPROACH OF THE SHAKESPEARE CENTER OF LOS ANGELES WHO PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL VA TO RECRUIT TRAIN AND PROVIDE PAID INTERNSHIPS FIRST THIRTY CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED VETERANS. TO WORK ON UNION CONTRACTED THEATER PRODUCTIONS. PARTICIPANTS ALSO ENROLLED IN SANTA MONICA COLLEGE. IN THEIR TECHNICAL THEATER ARTS COURSES AND RECEIVE JOB PLACEMENT SERVICES. THIS IS THE ARTS IN ACTION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO EMBARKING ON FUTURE OH EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT OUR GRANTS OUR MOST EFFECTIVELY MEETING THE NEEDS OF VETERANS IN OUR STATE. WE'RE ALSO FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING NEW PASTOR AND PARTNERS TO MAXIMIZE THE BREADTH AND THE REACH OF THE PROGRAMMING. THE DE MAYA DEMAND FOR V. I. A GRANTS HAVE INCREASE EACH YEAR. WERE PROUD TO SERVE THOSE WERE ABLE TO FUND AND AS WITH ALL OF OUR GRANT PROGRAMS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS IMPORTANT WORK THAT WERE UNABLE TO FIND. WE HOPE TO SEE THIS PROGRAM GROW IN THE FUTURE TO ADDRESS THE PRESSING NEED TO REACH MORE VETERANS THROUGH LOCAL PROGRAMMING. WE'RE DEEPLY HONORED THAT THE EXPERIENCES OF SOME OF OUR V. I. ES GRANTEES PARTNERS AND PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS WILL BE HEARD BY YOU TODAY. THESE REMARKABLE INDIVIDUALS WILL SHARE WITH ALL OF US ALL OF THE IMPACT THE ARTS HAVE HAD ON THEIR LIVES IN THEIR OWN VOICES. GREATER THAN I COULD EVER BE COUNTY. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE ARTS COUNCIL TO HONOR DOCTOR BUSS YANNI AND GENERAL BEVANS. AND ADAM CHRISTOPHER'S PHYLLIS AMBER ELIZABETH REGGIE MAMBO AND REBEKAH ALL OF WHOM I MET EARLIER TODAY BEFORE THE HEARING. I'M HERE TODAY TO LISTEN MINDFULLY. IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR BROWN FOR CREATING THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. AND FOR STILL HAVING A STRONG BELIEF IN THE ARTS TODAY AS DEMONSTRATED MOST RECENTLY BY HIS MAY REVISION PROPOSED FUNDING INCREASE TO SUPPORT ARTS COUNCIL PROGRAMS LIKE VETERANS IN THE ARTS. THANK YOU TO SENATOR ALLEN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR YOUR EXCEPTIONAL LEADERSHIP. AND ALL MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHO ARE HERE TODAY AND WHO SUPPORT THE ARTS AND CREATIVE EXPRESSION IN THIS BUILDING AND IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO OUR SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN PAST AND PRESENT IS A PRIVILEGE TO BE CHAMPIONS FOR YOUR EXPRESSION IN YOUR EXPERIENCE. TO YOU AND TO THE ARTIST AND COMMUNITY LEADERS TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR VOICE. YOU THINK YOU CREATURE THAT I. YOU KNOW IT CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF. THE OPENING OF THIS HENRY THE FOURTH. PERFORMANCE ON ELECTION NIGHT JUNE FIFTH. YEAH. BUT. FALSTAFF WILL BE LOOKING DOWN UPON THE VOTERS. THOUGHT LET ME WITH THAT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE FANTASTIC PRESENCE OF FILE AND OF MY COLLEAGUE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY CITY COME UNDER WHO ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE WEST LA VIA BELIEVE. AND WHO LSO WAS WITH ME AT THE LOS ANGELES VETERANS. AT THE CEMETERY THE NATIONAL CEMETERY LAST FRIDAY FOR THIS FLAGS AND FLOWERS IT MEANT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. YOU'RE WELCOME A COUPLE COMMENTS BUT IT WILL RUN BUT. OKAY WHAT WILL WILL CARRY ON WITH THE. WITH THE PANEL THAT WE NEXT HAVE KNOWN DEFENSE AS A BREEDER GENERAL WITH THE US ARMIES THAT. HAVE RETIRED BUT THEN HE. COME FROM GUY YOU BASED OUT OF WASHINGTON BECAUSE DC WASHINGTON DC. WHERE HE THE? GUY IS A MILITARY ARTS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ADVISOR FOR THIS COLLABORATIVE CREATIVE FORCES INITIATIVE WHICH. BRINGS TOGETHER AT THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE WITH THE NATIONAL FOR THE ARTS AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE YOU HERE. WE THINK IT'S A VERY MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENATE ALLEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FOR HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ALSO TO THE DISTINGUISHED PANEL THANK YOU. FOR THAT AND I KIND OF FEEL A LITTLE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. VETO SAID HE'S A COLONEL SO I FEEL A LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY TO. AS THE SENIOR GUY HERE TO KIND OF RECOGNIZE ALL THE OTHER VETERANS IN THE AUDIENCE. AND SAY TO THEM THANK THEM THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICES AND AND WHAT THEY'VE GIVEN SO MUCH AS WELL AS HER FAMILY MEMBERS. SO I COME TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY IF YOU PERMIT ME KIND OF LIKE SO SO WHAT IS THE WHY I OFTENTIMES ON AMENITIES AUDIENCE OF PEOPLE LOOK AT ME AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU HERE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHAT YOU BRING JUST VOICE. I THINK A DEMOCRAT AND I THINK THAT. I THINK THAT IT IT COMES OUT OF THE IDEA THAT THERE REALLY IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN ARTS AND AND AND THE MILITARY. SO MAYBE TO MY. COMES TODAY ELECTED MAYBE DISPEL THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT ALSO SHARE WHERE I THINK IT'S A LOT IS NOT TRUE THE WHERE THERE'S A GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. BUT AS STATED. MONEY WAS NO LIVE INSIDE SPENT THIRTY TWO YEARS ON ACTIVE DUTY. AND I COME TO IS COME TO SUCH A FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW I TRANSITION WHEN I ACTUALLY CAME INTO MILITARY ACTIVITY MILITARY AT THE POST VIETNAM TIME. AT ODOS THIRTY YEARS I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. DRASTIC CHANGE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND THE COMMUNITY IN GENERAL BUT ALSO HEARTS I THINK IN SPECIFIC. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS. FRAME MY COMMENTS ARE OWNED ON THESE OCCASIONS MOSTLY AROUND THE IDEA OF THIS BEING A COMMUNITY DISCUSSION. AND THE REASON I DO THAT IS BECAUSE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AROUND OUR MILITARY BASES ARE TRULY THE HOMES. OF OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AS YOU PERHAPS KNOW EIGHTY PERCENT. A MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS LIVE IN THE ACTUAL COMMUNITY DO NOT LIVE ON THE BASIS. AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND WE ESTABLISHES NOTION OF COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITY DISCUSSION. WHAT HERE'S OF REAL BOTTOM LINE I THINK I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY AS I BELIEVE THE ARTS IN THE MILITARY COMMUNITY HAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY? TO SERVE EACH OTHER AND ARE AS NEVER BEFORE AND EVEN GROW STRONGER ARTS IN MILITARY COMMUNITIES. THAT'S MY PASSION AND EVEN STRONGER ARTS IN MILITARY COMMUNITY IN SERVICE TO EACH OTHER. NOW IN I I LIKE TO OPEN DE THE COMETS WITH THE LITTLE PORTRAYING A PROBABLE DISPOSED TO YOU MY BIAS FOR THE ART BUT BUT I DO IT IN ORDER TO CREATE A METAPHOR. FOR MY DISCUSSION. TWO ROADS DIVERGED IN A WOOD. AND I TOOK THE ONE LESS TRAVELED BY. AND THAT HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. THESE ARE THE WORDS BY ROBERT FROST WE ALL REALLY RECOGNIZE. BUT I'LL FOR SLIGHT TWIST ON THESE WORDS TO CREATE A METAPHOR FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN ARTS IN MILITARY COMMUNITY. WELL ALL COULD LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. INSTEAD OF DIVERGING I THINK THE ROADS OF THE ARTS IN THE MILITARY COMMUNITIES OF CONVERGING THE TOWEL COMMUNITY. AND IF THE ARTS AND MILITARY COMMUNITY SEIZE THIS MOMENT WE CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. IT'S A TOPIC THAT MANY OF US UPON HEARING MY CONSIDERATION VERY ON RELATED AS I STATED EARLIER. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A LONG HISTORY BETWEEN ARTS AND MILITARY. THE LONG WINTER OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. WHEN THE COULD CONTINENTAL ARMY SPENT IN CAPTIVE BALLOTS FORD. WAS INTERRUPTED BY A PRESENTATION OF THE PLAY KATO. COMMISSION BY GEORGE WASHINGTON HIMSELF FOR THE TROOPS. THEN THERE'S THE GRAY GHOST ARMY OF WORLD WAR TWO. A FACT OF MILITARY SECRECY UNTIL IT'S DARK DECLASSIFICATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. SPECIFICALLY THE TWENTY THIRD HEADQUARTERS SPECIAL TROOPS WAS AN ELITE FORCE WHOSE SPECIALTY WAS TACTICAL DECEPTION. KNOWN AS THE GHOST ARMY A TROUPE OF SOLDIERS DOUBLED IN EUROPE'S THEATER AS A TROUPE OF ACTORS. THEY CREATED INFLATABLE TANKS TO DECEIVE GERMAN MILITARY. IT IT TOO IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE ALLIES EMBRACED HIS ARTISTRY OF THE ART. I THINK WE'RE NOW AT A MOMENT WHERE THE TWO COMMUNITIES CAN AGAIN SERVE EACH OTHER. ALBEIT THIS TIME ON THE HOME FRONT. THE OPERATIVE QUESTION ONE MIGHT ASK IS HOW DO WE GET TO THIS POINT HOW DID ARTS IN THE MILITARY. GET TO A POINT WHERE THEY CAN FIND VALUE IN SERVICE TOGETHER. LET'S DEAL WITH THE FIRST ONE WHAT BRINGS A MILITARY SERVICE POINT OF CONVERGENCE. I THINK IT'S A TREMENDOUS SET OF CHALLENGES AND DEMANDS BEFORE THEM. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE MORE THAN TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION US TROOPS HAVE DEPLOYED. THEY'VE SEEN A HISTORIC AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF MULTIPLE DEPLOYMENTS. THEY'VE EXPERIENCED SHORTEN TIME AT HOME BETWEEN THE DIPLOMATS. MORE RETURNING HOME WITH SPECIFIC MENTAL AND MORAL INJURIES. TWENTY TWO VETERANS. TWENTY TWO MILLION VETERANS OR IN THE US TODAY. AND OVER ONE PERCENT OF THAT IS OF OUR POPULATION. EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND M. OF VIETNAM VETERANS. THEN THERE'S A FAMILY SIDE OF THE STORY. THERE ARE ONE POINT TWO MILLION CHILDREN OF ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS. THE AVERAGE MILITARY CHAO WILL MOVE TEN TIMES DOING THEIR PARENTS CARILLO. FAMILIES LIVE OFF THE MILITARY INSULATION IN THE CIVILIAN COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE BY THE WAY. NEARLY TWO MILLION CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED APPARENT DEPLOYMENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE. DIPLOMATS AVERAGE EIGHT MONTHS THAT'S REPRESENTED THAT REPEATED ANIMALS OFTEN WHAT DO A FAMILY MEMBER HAD HOUSEHOLDS. IT'S OPERATIONAL TEMPO AND THE RESIDENT RESIDUAL OF FIFTEEN YEARS OF NEAR CONTINUOUS COMBAT. HAS PUT A STRESS ON THE FORCE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND SLEPT MANY WITHIN WITH INVISIBLE WOUNDS OF WAR. INVISIBLE WOUNDS LIKE PTSD TBI BUT WHICH MANY DO NOT SEEK TREATMENT FOR FEAR OF NEGATIVE STICK STIGMA. BUT EVEN IN THE FACE OF THIS OUR TROOPS ARE EXPERIENCING AND EXPRESSING THE VALUE OF THE ARTS IN HELPING THEM HEAL AND COPE WITH THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY DEMANDS. OF BEING BROUGHT UP ON THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE ARTS IN MY OPINION OFFER A NON STIGMATIZED ENVIRONMENT. WHERE VETERANS CAN CHOOSE THEIR OWN METHOD OF HEALING? AND CAN GO AND DEAL WITH AND CREATE WHAT I CALL POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. BECAUSE VETERANS DO NOT WANT TO BE SEEN AS VICTIMS THEY WANT TO BE SEEN AS STRONG AND CAPABLE. SO I JUST PUSH THE WORD BECAUSE I'VE COMPENSATED WITH THEM AND I REALIZED THAT WHAT THEY'RE REALLY SEEKING HIS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS STRENGTH. NOW HOW DID ARTS GET TO THIS POINT OF CONVERGENCE. HISTORICALLY HAS ANY ART HISTORIAN A ROOM WOULD TELL YOU. THE BIG OUR EVOLUTION COVERS A NEOLITHIC AND HOW HELLENISTIC PEERAGE THE RENAISSANCE AND ALSO CONTEMPORARY ART PERIOD OF EXPRESSION. BUT THE PRACTICE RESULTS OF THE ARTS BIG EVOLUTION IS AT THE ARTS HAVE PROGRESSED TO A POINT. THAT WITHIN THE MILITARY COMMUNITY ARTISTIC EXPRESSION IS BEING UTILIZED AS A TOOL TO HEAL. MOBILE. AND SUSTAIN RESILIENCY. AND ADVOCATING FOR THE VALUE OF THE ARTS THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF STATE ARTS AGENCIES LIST FIVE ESSENTIAL ARGUMENTS FOR THE ARTS THE FIRST ONE IS. THE ARTS IN RICH THE AMERICAN ECONOMY FESTIVAL ECONOMIC ARGUMENT FOR THE ARTS. THE ARTS OFFER SOLUTIONS FOR RURAL AMERICA. THE ARTS OFFER COST EFFECTIVE HEALTH TREATMENT THAT WORKS AND YOU'LL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS. THE ARTS IMPROVE EDUCATION VESTED EDUCATION ARGUMENT. AND FINALLY THEY SAY THE ARTS OFFER A NET GAIN FOR THE GOVERNMENT. BUT IF NUMBER FIVE IS TRUE AND I THINK IT IS. I BELIEVE THE ARTS COMMUNITY CAN NOW ADD A SIX VALUE OF THE ARTS. I CALLED IT THE ARTS OFFER BENEFITS TO NATIONAL SECURITY. THEY CAN BE A TOOL TO ENABLE HEALING. BUILDING AND SUSTAINING THE READINESS AND RESILIENCY OF THE FORCE AND THAT GETS SET READ IS SO THAT'S WHY I'M KIND OF IT THE TABLE MODEL OPERATIONAL GUY. AND I HAD A EXPERIENCE THAT SHOWED ME THAT POTENTIALLY I WOULD BE CARRYING VETERANS. OUR SERVICE MEMBERS BACK INTO WAR THAT HAD NOT TOTALLY HEALED. BECAUSE THEY HAD INVISIBLE MOVES AND THAT'S WHEN I BECAME ENGAGED IN IS BECAUSE THAT WAS A VERY MEANINGFUL PART FOR ME. THIS IS THE MOMENT IN TIME AS I SHOULD WITH YOUR EARLY OR I THINK ARTS OFFER SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES OUR SERVICE MEMBERS FACE. AND BY EXTENSION THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION. BUT. THIS AS I STATED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS IS A COMMUNITY DISCUSSION. AND THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM SUPPORTING. VETERANS AND ARTS HEALING LIVES THROUGH CREATIVE EXPRESSIONS IS NOT LIMITED TO THE MILITARY PORTION OF OUR COMMUNITY. THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALING THAT ART CAN SUPPORT. HERE'S HERE'S WHERE IN MANY OF MY TALKS ON THIS SUBJECT ARE NORMALLY ASK THE AUDIENCE. WHAT DOES THE BATTLE OF FALLUJAH? FORT LAUDERDALE AIRPORT. SEVEN HOOKED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THE BOSTON MARATHON. TELL US ABOUT THE CURRENT REALITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IN ONE AND WORD ANSWER TRAUMA. OUR COMMUNITIES ARE AWASH IN TRAUMA. JUST LIKE OUR SERVICEMEN WERE EXPERIENCED IN THE BATTLE OF FALLUJAH. AND THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF IT LETTING UP. JUST THINK OF THIS. OF THE OF THE TWELVE LARGEST MASS SHOOTINGS IN AMERICA. SEVEN OF THEM HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE BATTLE OF FALLUJAH OCCURRED. THE MILITARY IS STILL FACED WITH BALANCING THE HIGH OPERATIONAL TEMPO WITH INCREASED TRAINING. THIS LOAD OFTEN FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON STATE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND RESERVISTS. AND HERE'S ANOTHER KEY POINT. WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY LONELINESS IS PROJECTED TO BE THE NEXT HEALTH CRISIS. THE ARTS OFFER SOLUTIONS TO BOTH THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN COMPONENTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW EFFORTS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS SOLUTION AND PROBABLY SUPPORT THOSE AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IT'S PURSUING. THAT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE. YOU SEE I RECENTLY PARTICIPATED. IN THE THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. OF SUMMIT THAT WAS HELD IN SAN DIEGO FOR THE CREATIVE FORCES INITIATIVE. I LEARNED A VETERANS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHO STATED. THE ARTS SAVE THEIR LIVES. SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE INITIATIVES THE FIRST ONE IS A NATIONAL INITIATIVE ARTS AND HEALTH IN THE MILITARY WHICH SEEKS TO ADVANCE THE ARTS AND HEALTH HEALING AND HEALTH CARE FOR MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS. VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEN THERE'S. VETO INDICATED THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION ARTS AND HUMANITIES HAS A PILOT PROJECT THAT'S EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE OUTCOMES. THEY'RE FOCUSING ON CREATIVE ARTS THERAPIES AND OUR PARTNERSHIPS IN PATIENT CENTERED CARE OF. PLANNING. THEY'RE ALSO MAPPING OUT LOCAL ARTS RESOURCES AT EACH SITE. AND I MENTION THESE BECAUSE I THINK THEY OFFER PATERNS FOR MANY OF THE STATES AND THE NEXT ONE. THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS CREATIVE FORCES INITIATIVE IS A UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN DOD AN NEA. AND BELIEVE ME WHEN YOU GET DOD ANY ANY A AND A ROOM TO AGREE. YOU'VE AFRICA THING GOING. BUT I THINK IT ALSO REPRESENTS A MODERATE AND PATTERN FOR A LOT OF OF STATE ORGANIZATIONSWHO MAY WANT TO PURSUE IT. THIS INITIATIVE WAS LAUNCHED BY ANY A AND DOD AND TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. THAT MANY OF THE NATIONAL INTREPID CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE. PARTICULARLY WATER READS THAT'S LOCATED IN THE FASTER AND NOW IT HAS EXPANDED TO SEVEN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY ONE OF THEM IS HERE IN. CALIFORNIA WITH SAN DIEGO. IT EXTENDS THERAPEUTIC ART ENGAGEMENTS INTO THE COMMUNITY OF PATIENTS ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALIZE AND RECOGNIZE IT THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE VETERANS WHO NEED TREATMENT DON'T EVER GET THE TREATMENT. AND THEY DON'T GET INTO THE MEDICAL WORLD IN THE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH IT. I THINK THE ARTS CREATE THAT AVENUE AND METHOD AN ALTERNATIVE WHERE THEY CAN SEEK THAT TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT STIGMA. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ANY A DOD. STATE AND LOCAL ARTS AGENCIES AND AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS WHO SERVES AS ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE PROJECT. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE NATIONAL LIEUTENANT GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION'S PARTNERSHIP. WHICH OF THE STATE MILITARY AND VETERANS ART INITIATIVE. ALSO SUPPORTED BY AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS. THERE ARE THREE GOES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INITIATIVE THAT I LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT. POLICY DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS AN EFFORT TO HAVE EACH AND EVERY LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR PARTICIPATE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. BUT ALSO ALLOW THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS LEADERS GOVERNOR'S ASSOCIATION TO WORK WITH EACH LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE AS WELL. THERE'S ALSO A RESEARCH COMPONENT TO THAT TO PROVIDE STRATEGIES TO ENCOURAGE COURAGE A BUDGET ALLOCATION SUPPORT. THE THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT GOAL TO THAT GOAL SEEKS TO IDENTIFY ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS IN EACH OF THE STATES. AND TERRITORIES TO CHAMPION THIS WORK IN ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF STATE MILITARY AND VETERAN AFFAIRS INITIATIVE. AND THE THIRD OBJECTIVE. INGOLD THIS IS TODEVELOP RESOURCES THAT ARE RELEVANT AND USEFUL FOR LOCAL ARTS GROUPS ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS TO USE. TO JUSTIFY AND PROMOTE THE STATE MILITARY VETERANS ARTS INITIATIVE. THE NATIONAL LEADER A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S ASSOCIATION IN AMERICA FOR THE ARTS WOULD PRODUCE VARIOUS PUBLICATIONS TO. PUBLISHED ELECTRONICALLY IN PRINT HIGHLIGHTS MATERIALS AND HIS SUCCESSES ON HOW ELECT OFFICIALS KEPT DISSIPATED. SO LET ME CONCLUDE WHERE I STARTED. THANK YOU SENATE ALLEN VICE CHAIRMAN XU. AND ALL THE OTHER SIMPLY MEMBERS AND LEGISLATORS AND COUNCIL TOOK A CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS VITAL AND ESSENTIAL COMMUNITY CONVERSATION. THAT IT IS JUST THAT. A COMMUNITY DISCUSSION ABOUT VETERANS AND THE ARTS HEALING LIVES THROUGH CREATIVE EXPRESSION. THANK YOU SO VERY KIM. THANK HIM. VERY COLD VERY INTERESTING. HAVE YOU FOUND RIGIDLY A FEW FIRST GENERAL. WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE HAN VEGAS SERVE CULTURAL ROADBLOCKS YOU HAVE MET? WITH BOTH SIDES. PAT HAVE THERE BEEN SOME MONTHS HAVE BEEN SINCE SOME SURPRISING. CHALLENGES. IDEA YOU MAY BE OBVIOUS FOR US TO CONSIDER AND THE OBVIOUS CHALLENGES THAT MIGHT EXIST ON THE DOD SIDE BUT MAYBE ON THE OUTSIDE TO. CAN YOU FLESH SOME OF THOSE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES OUT HOW YOU'VE BEEN HELPING A PERSON. IT ALWAYS ONE TO LIGHT A CANDLE FOR YOU CURSE THE DARKNESS RIGHT SO. I THINK I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE THE THE THE GREAT CULTURAL SIMILARITY. OF THE MILITARY FOR MOST OF THE. A YOU KNOW SERVICE MEMBERS ABOUT SERVICE RIGHT THEY WANT TO GIVE BACK GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN THEMSELVES. AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I FIND IN THE ART COMMUNITY MOST INDIVIDUALS GOING YARD BECAUSE THEY TOO WANT TO SERVE THEY WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING FOR THEY ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE SUCH A GIFT AND A TALENT WITHIN THEMSELVES. BUT THEY DO SO WITH THE IDEA OF GIVING BACK. RIGHT. SO I THINK IF WE CAN HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT THERE'S MORE ARE THERE'S A LITTLE COMMONALITY IN TERMS OF THE CULTURE. AND AND GO INTO THE DISCUSSION WITH THAT I THINK IT HELPS US GET TO THE NEXT STOP POINT SOMEHOW MAKE CARS. I THINK THE FIRST POINT OF OF THE DILUTED TOO WHEN I TALK ABOUT POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. WHAT PARENTS WANT MOST IMPORTANTLY FROM THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING ANY TYPE OF CARE IN A TYPE OF TREATMENT FOR THEM AS A RECOGNIZE THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE NOT BROKEN BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO? TO REGAIN US LEVEL OF STRENGTH THAT THEY HAD PRIOR TO THAT. SO THAT CULTURE OF STRAND. NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT FOR THE MILITARY THAT BECOMES A WEAKNESS BECAUSE. THERE WAS A STUDY THAT INDICATED. THE FIFTEEN THINGS THAT SERVICE MEMBERS WANTED THE COMMUNITY KNOW ABOUT THEM. NUMBER SEVEN WAS IS THAT IT'S HARD FOR US TO ASK FOR HELP AND. SO THAT CULTURE OR THE MILITARY HAS TO BE OVERCOME BUT I THINK IT ALL COMES BY THE IDEA THAT THE ARTS DISS THE STRENGTH NOW OF THE OF THAT. THE ARTS PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN GO WE AND SELECT. AND SHOES WITHOUT BEING STIGMATIZE. AND I THINK THAT ASPECT OFOF WHAT THE ART OUR CULTURE OFFERS IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK THE ONLY DARK SIDE OF THE QUESTION. AND I THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT THING IS AND I USE A MEDICAL UPON METAPHOR FOR THIS DO NO HARM. I THINK THE CULTURAL ASPECT IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T WORKED WITH THE POPULATION. TRAINING AND AWARENESS OF ABOUT WHAT'S CLEAR IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND I'M SURE YOU HEAR A LOT OF THOSE WHO ARE WORKING IN THOSE PROGRAMS LATER ON AND TESTIMONY TO TO GIVE EVIDENCE TO THAT. I HOPE THAT ANSWERED CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE HIM. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR SHARING IT. LISTENING TO YOU ACTUALLY REMINDED ME OF THEM. A SEGMENT THAT IWAS LISTENING TO ON PUBLIC RADIO. WITH A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT. SOME CHALLENGES HE WAS DEALING WITH WITH. A YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS. AND DYING AND. EMPATHY. WAS A WORD THAT HE KEPT BRINGING UP. AND HOW HE WAS FIGHTING BACK. HE MOTIONS AS IT RELATES TO HOW HE WAS FEELING ABOUT. THIS YOUNG GIRL BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN TRAINED TO NOT WANT TO FEEL. BECAUSE EMPATHY WAS CONSIDERED A WEAKNESS. AND YET THE VERY FACT THAT HE HAD. THESE EMOTIONS ACTUALLY ALLOWED HIM TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE YOUNG GIRLS PARENTS. AT HER FUNERAL BECAUSE SHE DIED. BUT IT MADE WE THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE SAYING IN THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE MILITARY COMMUNITY AND THE ARTS COMMUNITY BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND THE ARTS COMMUNITY IS ALSO ABOUT. INVOKING EMPATHY INVULNERABILITY AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE AND UNCOMFORTABLE SPACES. AND THE MILITARY WE SOMETIMES DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS. AND SO HOW CAN WE COLLECTIVELY DO A BETTER JOB OF TRYING TO BRIDGE THOSE GAPS BECAUSE I'M. OF THE BELIEF THAT IT'S OKAY TO FEEL COMFORTABLE UNCOMFORTABLE IF YOU'RE IN A SAFE SPACE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO WORK THROUGH THAT. AND OBVIOUSLY THE ARTS ARE. IT'S A WAY FOR VETERANS FOR EVERYONE BUT FOR THOSE IN THE MILITARY TO. TO CONNECT TO SOME OF THOSE. FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS. THAT HOPEFULLY OUR OUR CHECKERS FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE PTS. THE. POST TRAUMATIC STRENGTHENED HOW DO WE KIND OF LOOK. TO DE STIGMATIZE. SOME OF THOSE. FEELINGS AND SPACE SAYS THAT WE TRY TO SEPARATE. FROM THE MILITARY EXPERIENCE. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT. PROBABLY. THIS IS WHERE THE ARTS ALMOST STRONG COMPARED TO A LOT OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS. I'M FASCINATED TO WHEN I LOOK AT SOME OF THE THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WITHOUT WITHIN ALL THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. THAT PUT PUT VETERAN SHARE WITH ME IS THAT. THEY NEED A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN GO IN FIRST OF ALL HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEMSELVES BECAUSE OFTENTIMES TO THE CHALLENGES SHE DID FEEL THEY DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO TO TALK WITH ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED. AND SO I I THINK THAT IF WE CAN CONTINUE PROGRAMS AND AND THOSE ARE OF. PROGRAMS I THINK THAT THE ART REALLY HAS A STRONG POTENTIAL TO HELP WITH. THAT ALLOWS THE THE SERVICE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY MEMBER I WAS MENTIONING. AT THE BEGINNING HERE. THAT IT ALSO GETS INTO THE EDUCATION OF ARTS BECAUSE IF YOU GET IT TO THE CHILDREN YOU ALSO GET THE PARENTS AND OFTENTIMES I'VE I'VE FOUND. A LOT OF VETERANS HAVE GOTTEN INTO ART PROGRAMS BECAUSE THE CHILDREN BROUGHT THEM INTO THE ARTS PROGRAM. SO I WOULD SAY THERE TO LOOK HOLISTICALLY. IS IT WOULD BE MY ANSWER TOOK TO LOOK TO LOOK HOLISTICALLY CROSSED WHAT PARTS OF PROVIDING NOT JUST AT THE SERVICE MEMORABLE BUT ALSO CARE GIVER BUT ALSO. THAT THE CHAO. AND THAT'S WHY I WENT TO THE POINT OF MAKING THOSE STATISTICS AND MY DISCUSSION BECAUSE. THE CHILDREN ALSO A PART OF THIS AND AND I WOULD JUST SAY ALSO THAT. IT'S NOT JUST THE. PTSD TBI END OF THE SPECTRUM THAT THAT YOU WE ADDRESS SOMEWHERE. A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES COME WILL FUND TRANSITION FROM THE MILITARY RIGHT AND GOING BACK INTO THE TO TO CIVILIAN LIFE. IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH LIFESTYLE I MEAN THAT THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE HAVE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS IT HAS SUICIDE IMPLICATE ME DOES A LOT OF. ASPECTS OF THE SPECTRUM THAT. THAT THAT ART CAN ALSO ALLOW THEM TO HEAL IN THE HEALTH AND. I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU YES. INFANT. CONTROVERSIAL OKAY I THINK YOU BRIDGES CEMETERY BAY FOR SUGAR. YOUR INSIGHTS AND AND I MOST IMPORTANTLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK. IN THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. CONFLUENCE ZONE PARA AND WILL BE LEARNING A LOT MORE ABOUT IT IS AS WE GO ALONG TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT OVERVIEW. AND LET'S NOW MOVE TO OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH INVOLVES VETERANS VOICES PERSONAL EXPERIENCES FOR VETERANS ENGAGED. WITH THE ARTS AND I THINK WHAT WE PROBABLY WANT TO DO JUST GIVEN THE AND. THE NUMBER OF. AN ANALYSIS YEAR HOW MANY SEATS WE HAVE. GREEN OF THE CARE. ISRAEL DID YOU END UP COULD YOU POSSIBLY WORK FROM OVER THERE SAMMER. HISTOGRAM. NO QUESTION RESERVE. CAN WE SERVICE FOR HERE. YEAH YEAH. OR IS OR SHOULD WE. THEY WANT IT SO YOU CAN'T YOU SEE I HAVE TO BE THE TABLE IS ARE YOU SAYING HE DOES BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE'S. OKAY WELL SPECIFIC AREAS ON IT DOESN'T IT GIVES YOU GO TO A COZY WE HAVE FOUR. PEOPLE ON THE PANEL. HA SO. BUT YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL. VETERANS THERE USE THE TIGHT QUARTERS. THIS COULD HURT HIM.

OUR TALK ABOUT A LOT BUT I DON'T GET A CHANCE AT THE VOICE THAT HEARD. AND ARE FROM ONE OF OUR FOCUSES ON VETERAN COMMUNITY. TOM IT'S BEST FOR ME TO DESCRIBE WHAT INSTEAD OF DESCRIBING WHAT WE DO. IS TO READ WHAT I HAVE BEEN. BUT I'VE DONE. UNTIL IT WHERE DID YOU WHERE DID YOU SERVE SENT AND. I CERTAINLY CORPORATE TWENTY YEARS FROM NINETEEN NINETY THREE TO TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I WAS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN WILL COMBAT TOURS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AND ABOUT MUCH MORE THE PEACEKEEPING MISSION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THIS STORY IS ONE OF THE STORIES THAT SO SO WE ALL HELP ME CREATE AND THAT SINCE BEEN PUBLISHED AND RADIO TELEVISED. THROUGH MY SCOPE I SEE HIM STANDING THERE. ON THE BRINK OF OBLIVION. IMAGINING HIS* PLEASE EXISTENCE. WHETHER TO TAKE THAT STEP. HE SWAYS WITH THE MILD WHEN ALLOWING ITS PRES TO CARESS HIM LIKE A MOTHER ROCKS HER CHILD. HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER. AS IF TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS THERE TO GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT. THERE IS NO ONE. I IMAGINE HE IS ALONE IN THIS WORLD AND THAT THIS IS ONLY WAY. THAT HE TURNED TO LOOK IN HIS EYE HAS CHANGED NO LONGER IS IT FAIR BUT THAT. OF DETERMINATION. HE TAKES THE STEP IDLING CLOSER AS IF TO STOP HIM I SCREAM IN MY HEAD FOR HIM TO GO BACK. MY HAND INSTINCTIVELY REACHES OUT AS THOUGH I COULD PUSH HIM BACKWARDS FROM FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY. I CLOSE MY EYES CRINGING AT THE ANTICIPATION OF THE COMMOTION THAT IS ABOUT TO OCCUR. DEAFENING SILENCE. I STRENGTHENED MY RESOLVE AND LOOK BACK THROUGH THE SCOPE WATCHING HIM WALK TOWARDS ME. I HAVE TRAINED FOR TWENTY YEARS TO SURVIVE IN A COMBAT SITUATION HOW TO FIGHT HOW TO READ OTHERS TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE A THREAT. I HAVE TRAINED FOR DECADES TO STRENGTHEN MY MIND ANDBODY I'VE MASTERED THE ART OF HAND TO HAND COMBAT I CAN ACTRESS TO MY RIFLE AND SITES ARMED WITH NEAR PINPOINT ACCURACY. I HAVE LEARNED TO NUMB MY EMOTIONS BY THE LOSS OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS. AND SING WHAT MY OWN RIFLE CAN DO TO THE ENEMY. I CAN SHOOT A MAN IN THE CENTER OF THIS CHEST FROM NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY. AND PUT MY KNIFE THROUGH HIS THROAT SO CLOSE I CAN COUNT THE NUMBER OF CAVITIES IN HIS MOUTH. I HAVE GONE THROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY COMBAT TOUR JUST TO ENSURE I CAN STILL BE CONSIDERED. SAYING. HE WALKS TOWARDS ME ALL MY YEARS OF TRAINING MIGHT DECADES OF EXPERIENCE MANAS LIKE SMOKING A BREEZE I'M LOST IN THE SEA OF A MOTION. THERE HE WAS A CHILD NO OLDER THAN MY OWN THIRTEEN YEAR OLD SON WALKING TOWARDS ME. BUT NOT TO ME. HE'S WALKING TO A DISCARDED VEHICLE LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ANCIENT MIND FILL. A LEFTOVER-FROM A PAST FOR A CONSTANT MONTH REMINDER OF THE HORRORS THIS COUNTRY HAS SEEN. HE WALKS WITH PURPOSE. KNOWING THAT IF HE MAKES MAKES A TO THAT SHATTERED WHOLE CORRODING IN THE SAND HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T SELL TO THE TALIBAN HE KNOWS. THAT THE PRICE IS HIGH. THE BIGGER THE ITEM THE MORE DESTRUCTIVE CAN BE THE BETTER OFF HE WILL BE. AN OLD ARTILLERY SHELL COMPETING FOR A MONTH BUT ANYTHING SALAS COMPUTING FOR A DAY POSSIBLY A WEEK. HE KNOWS THAT THE MARINES GUARDING THE SMALL OUTPOST JUST FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY ARE AUTHORIZED TO SHOOT AND KILL ANYONE THEY DEEM A THREAT. HIS LIVELIHOOD DEPENDS ON WHAT HE FINDS. JUST AS THE WEAPON HE WEARS ACROSS HIS BACK IT HIS WAY TO SURVIVE. HE'S BEEN RAISED HERE AND HE KNOWS THAT THERE IS SAFETY IN THE FIELD. SEEN SO MUCH DEATH. MANY HAVE TRIED BEFORE HIM THE BILL THE STREWN WITH SIGNS OF THOSE WHO LEFT FELL. SHREDS OF CLOTH HERE A CRATER THERE EVEN IF SHE WERE TO. HE KNOWS. WHERE DEATH ONCE WAS HE IS SAFE? PORTLAND MY CAN ONLY EXPLODE ONCE. HE RIDES AT A CRATER AND JUMPS INSIDE RESTING FOR A MOMENT KNEELING DOWN AS IF TO PRAY TO HIS GUIDE. TO GIVE HIM STRENGTH TO CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY AS HE HUNKERS DOWN INTO THE DEPRESSION. I SEE MY OWN CHILDREN. PLAYING AT THE BEACH BUILDING SAND CASTLES BEARING EACH OTHER. LAUGHING AS THEY WANTED TO JUMP RUN AND JUMP AND HOLES NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THE BOYS BURSTING IN NOW. ONLY THREE HUNDRED YARDS FROM MY POSITION. FROM THIS DISTANCE I CAN EASILY HIT MY TARGET. THE WIND IS SLIGHTLY BLOWING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT THE SUN IS BEHIND ME. EVERYTHING ALL SHADOWS AND HIGHLIGHTING MY TARGET. AND ACTUALITY WOULD BE AN EASY SIDE. CAN BE JUSTIFIED UNDER THE CURRENT RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. AS I SIGHED IN ON THE BOY. I MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO MY RIFLE. I PROGRESS THE PISTOL GRIP. BONUS SLIGHTLY TOWARD ME. ANSWERING THAT THE STOCK OF THE WEAPON IS COMFORTABLY IN MY SHOULDER. I REST THE BARREL OF THE WHAT MY WEAPON IN THE PLM MY FOREHAND ALLOWED TO JUST REST THERE. WAITING UNTIL THE MOMENT IS NECESSARY. MY TRIGGER FINGER HOVERS NEXT TO TRIGGER. WAITING FOR THE MOMENT. MY SHOOTING POSITIONS PERFECT. NO ONE NO ONE WOULD QUESTION WHY I PULLED THE TRIGGER. I'D MORE THAN LIKELY GET A FEW GOOD JOBS AND WHILE FROM THE YOUNGER LESS SEASON MARINES WHO TALK OPENLY ABOUT SEEM TO SING ACTION AND ONE IN THE SHOULD SOMETHING OTHER THAN A PAPER TARGET. YOUNG MARINES WHO HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT PART OF THE TELEVISION SCREEN PLANE MODERN WELL WARFARE AND SIMULATED WARS AROUND THE WORLD. WHO ALSO TEND TO TREAT LIFE AS JUST ANOTHER SIMILARITY? BUT THERE IS NO RESET BUTTON NO PAUSE AND NO CHEAT CODES. I HOLD MY POSITION WATCHING THE TARGET WITH MY FINGER NEXT TO TRIGGER. HE LIFTS HIMSELF OUT OF HIS HOLE AND STANDS AT THE THRESHOLD. HIS PRIDE IN THEIR FIFTY YARDS AWAY. BUT I MIGHT AS WELL BE ONE HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND EVEN TEN THOUSAND. FOR THE DISTANCE ISN'T THE PROBLEM. IT'S WHAT'S BETWEEN AND UNDERNEATH. HE TAKES A STEP AND BEGINS TO WALK AS HE MOVES HIS EYES ARE EVER VIGILANT SHIFTING SEARCHING FOR TELL OF SOMETHING SOME KIND OF DANGER. BUT STEP AFTER BUT STEP HIS BODY TENSES THAT MIGHT BE HIS LAST. I GUESS SEEM CLEARER NOW. THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW THE DIRT ON HIS FACE. EVEN BEGINNING OF MANHOOD AS A SLIGHT WISPY MUSTACHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE SLIP. I CAN ALSO SEE THAT HE IS NO STRANGER TO WAR. A RAGGED SCAR RUNS FROM WHERE HIS LEFT EAR SHOULD BE. TO THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH. HE'S MISSING TWO FINGERS FROM HIS LEFT HAND AND I POSTULATE. THAT HIS ENTIRE LEFT SIDE OF HIS BODY IS BATTLE DAMAGED IN SOME WAY. POSSIBLY. THE AFFECTS OF A LAND MINE HE WAS PORTION TO WALK AWAY FROM. MORE THAN LIKELY. BECAUSE I'VE SEEN TOO MANY TIMES. WHEN HE WAS AN INFANT HIS MOTHER SHOW THEM FROM THE DANGER PROTECTING HIM WITH HER BODY. LEAVING SCARS CLOSELY IT JUST TWENTY FIVE YARDS AWAY FROM HIS PRIZE. S. PACE IS SLOW AND METHODICAL CHOOSING EACH STEP CAREFULLY. I CAN REMINISCE OF MY CHILDREN. WHEN I SEND THEM TO BED FOR THE EVENING THE SLOW INTENTIONAL WALK DOWN THE HALL HOPING A REPRIEVE MIGHT COME FOR ME ALLOWING THEM JUST WATCH ONE MORE SHOW. NO REPRIEVE EVER COMES FOR ME. NOR WILL THAT BE FOR THE BOY WHO WENT RISK WHERE EARLY IN MY SIGHTS. HE'S ONLY YARDS AWAY THE PREVIOUS LABOR WITHIN TS GRASP MY BODY STIFFENS READY TO FIRE. HE CLIMBS INTO THE MANGLE THE MASS OF THE VEHICLE IT'S ANCIENT ARMOR SHIELDED FROM MY GAZE. THE WORLD ENVELOPES ME. BEHIND ME I CAN HEAR THE DISTANT SOUND OF MUSIC PLAYING ON THE RADIO MARINES ON A BREAK FROM THE WHAT LIES OUTSIDE OUR WALLS ARE PLAYING CARDS ON. HIDE THEIR MINDS. THE SMELL OF BAKED CHICKEN BEING PREPARED THE EVENING MAILBOX UP TO ME AND FOR A MOMENT I CAN RELAX. TECH. TECH. TECH. THE SECONDS SLOWLY PASSES. WHEN I SEE THE EXCEPT THE BOY EXITING THE VEHICLE I AM FUNNELED BACK INTO MY INTO THE REALITY THAT LAY IN FRONT OF ME. AND IS HANDED THE WOODEN BOX FILLED WITH MISCELLANEOUS WIRES AND PIECES OF SCRAP METAL. RESTING ON TOP IS HIS PERSONAL FORTUNE A CYLINDRICAL SHAPED OBJECT RESEMBLING AN OLD SOVIET MORTAR SO. THE BOY DOESN'T WASTE ANY TIME HE BEGINS CROSS IN THE FIELD AS POSSIBLE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE ATTEMPTING TO RETRACE HIS STEPS THAT HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO THIS TREASURE TROVE. THUD THUD DIED EMPTYING AND FILLING UP MY HEART IS NOW KEEPING TIME I TIGHTEN MY POSITION TO ENSURE I CAN GET A CLEAN SHOT THE BOY HAS NOW BECOME THE ENEMY NEVER MIND THE RIFLE HE WEARS ACROSS HIS BACK EVERY SIX YEAR OLD IN THIS COUNTRY HOUSE ONE. THE MORTAR SHELL IF SOLD TO THE TALIBAN COULD BE USED AGAINST THE MARINES AND SOLDIERS IN THE FIELD. HE MOVES QUICKLY I JUST FOR SPEED MY FINGER SLIPS INTO THE TRIGGER WELL AND I COULD FEEL THE WARMTH OF THE STILL AS I PLACE LIKE PRESSURE. MY WEAPON IS READY HE REACHES A CRATER WHERE I IMAGINE HIM PRAYING AND ABRUPTLY STOPS. HE'S FROZEN. NOT A MUSCLE IS MOVING I CAN FILL THE BARREL OF MY RIFLE BEARING DOWN ON HIM. HE'S MOTIONS BEADS OF SWEAT ROLLED DOWN HIS BACK BACK HIS NECK. HE'S BREATHING HEAVILY. HE STANDS FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE ETERNITY. CLICK. I APPLY MORE PRESSURE TO MY TRIGGER. HE SLOWLY LOWERS THE BOX OF GOOD DOWN FROM HIS CHEST AND LOOKED TOWARDS THE SKY. CLICK. I PLACED MY THUMB ON THE SAFETY READY TO UNLEASH THE DOGS OF WAR POEM. THE OUTPOST SIREN STARTS WELLING AND EVERY MARINE FROM AROUND THE COMPOUND. STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING OF BRUSHES THE PRIMER WITH RIFLES AND HAND TO DEFEND OUR POSITION. IT TAKES THE CLOUD. OF SAND AND DEBRIS FROM THE EXPLOSION TEN MINUTES TO FINALLY SETTLE. AFTER A FEW MINUTES DAHLE CLEAREST SOUNDED AND EVER GOES BACK TO WHAT THEY WERE DOING BEFORE. THE MUSIC STARTS. AND THE GAMES PLAY. BUT I HELPS WE LOOK OUT ACROSS THE BILL OF OBLIVION. I TORN ABOUT MOTION SWELLS I'M CONFUSED WASN'T ME NO MY WEAPON IS STILL UNSAFE WHERE IS THE BOY HE'S GONE. I. I'M THANKFUL. IT WASN'T ME. I DIDN'T HAVE TO. I WOULD HAVE IF I COULD HAVE BUT THIS TIME THIS TIME IT WASN'T MY CHOICE MY SOUL THOUGH EMPTIED. STILL INTACT. I AM ANGRY AND DEMORALIZED I UNDERSTAND WHY THE POINT MADE THE TRACK ALL THIS CHILD WANTED TO DO WAS TO LIVE TO SURVIVE I THINK OF ALL THE CHILDREN THAT A PROSELYTE PATH. THE ONES ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BACKING FOR CHANGE THE ONES IN REFUGEE CAMPS WAITING AND NEVER ENDING LINES EVEN THE ONES THAT HAVE STOLEN FROM ME. THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN COMMON THE WILL TO SURVIVE THAT BOY WAS DOING ALL HE WANTED TO DO TO SURVIVE HE WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO SURVIVE FOR MORE THAN JUST TODAY. JUST SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WALK THROUGH A MINEFIELD TOMORROW. AS I WALK OFF THE PLANE A FEW MONTHS LATER I SEE MY CHILDREN STANDING THERE. AT THE EDGE OF THE RUNWAY. I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK OF THE BOY IN HIS TRACK AND ALL THAT IT HAPPENS. I HAVE KILLED. I HAVE HEARD OTHERS. JUSTIFIED OR NOT. BUT I ALSO LOVED AND CARED FOR MY ENEMY AS I HAVE LOVED AND CARP MY OWN CHILDREN. NOW HERE THEY ALL ARE. RUNNING TO ME. THANK YOU. AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO SAY WE ALL DOES FOR ABOUT COMMUNITY. WE GIVE THEM A VOICE. HERE. BUT THE SURGEON APPRECIATED IF YOU. ALRIGHT. MISS MILLER HERE SIR. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ITS HOSPITALITY. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF BEING HERE. OF FOR HAVING A LISTENING EAR. BECAUSE MANY OF THE VETERANS THAT I SPEAK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF. A DOES ANYONE CARE. OF OUR WE USE SOME TYPE OF FOLLOW TRINKET TO BE ON THE MANTLE. MANTLE OR DESK AND PULL DOWN WHEN IT'S BECOMES A HOLIDAY TO. GIVE KUDOS TO US AND I USE IT GOOGLE'S IN THE. CLICHE. IT IS A PHILOSOPHY IN THE NAVY DID. WE ALWAYS LIKE TO LIVE BY IT IS BETTER TO APOLOGIZE. THE AND ASK FOR PERMISSION. AND I SAY THAT IS HOW THE BIRTH OF THE VETERANS ORG VENUE WAS FOUNDED AND STARTED. THROUGHOUT THE VETERAN COMMUNITY I'M A IN AN OUTPATIENT AT THE WEST LOS ANGELES VA HOSPITAL. AND IN MY AND COUNTERS WITH THE WONDERFUL DOCTORS THERAPISTS. ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF IN AMONG THE VETERAN COMMUNITY. THERE WAS A COMMON GOAL. BUT THERE WAS A DISCONNECT. IN. BETWEEN EACH COMPONENT. AND THROUGH AN EXPERIMENT. I LAUNCH THE VETERANS ARE VENUE. I WAS CHASTISED BECAUSE I DIDN'T GO THROUGH PROPER PROCEDURES. AND I WAS CHALLENGED TO FIND DEL IS THERE A MARKET REALLY FALL FAR. CAN I RELATE TO THEM TO SAY ART IS NOT A LUXURY PART IS ESSENTIAL ART IS A VERY COMPONENT. THE BIG BREEDS. REFLECTION TRANQUILITY AND THOUGHT. VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED CONDITION. AND UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS EMOTIONS. SENSITIVITY. MINDFULNESS AND ALL OF THOSE ITEMS ARE NOT PART OF THE DECORUM IN THE MILITARY. ONCE YOU LEAVE THE MARYLAND MILITARY. YOU REALIZE THAT YOU BECAME HUMAN AGAIN. AND THROUGH ART. THAT IS THE BRIDGING OF THE GAP. THAT IS ALSO A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY. OF CIVILIANS WHO HAD NEVER SERVED. BUT YET APPREHENSIVE. BUT YEAH. EVASIVE. AND I HAVE PUT A ONE. ALREADY EXHIBITS WERE BOTH COMMUNITIES THE VETERANS IN THE CIVILIANS. THE COME TOGETHER. LOOKING UNIQUE ART. AND FROM ONE MY LEFT EAR FOR MORE RIGHT HERE IT COULD BE A CIVILIAN ASKING ME. WHILE THIS IS VERY INTERESTING I DO KNOW VETERANS FEEL THIS WAY. BOB HOW DO YOU TALK TO THEM. FROM THE VETERANS BROKE PERSPECTIVE ALL USE ONE OF THEM. WHOLE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY CARE THEIR HERE. THAT THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT US. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE VETERANS WHO OR. REPRESS SCENE IN OF SUBMERGING INFORMATION NOT ASKING FOR HELP BECAUSE HE TOO AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP OR TO INDEPENDENT TO ASK FOR HELP. AND THROUGH THESE ART VENUES THEY EITHER GET ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN OUR. EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITCHES AN OPEN MIND IS ALL I ASK OF ANY OF MY ART VENUES THROUGH. A FUND TERMDID I GIVE. IN INTENTIONALLY USE. IN ORDER TO KEEP. PEOPLE DISARM FROM LABELS AND THIS VENUE IS CALLED PAINT AND SIP. A FUN. FLAVOURS OF TEA FINGER FOODS PARTS SUPPLIES. AND THEY SIT DOWN AND I WE ILLUSTRATE ALL S. YOU'D HAVE IS AN OPEN MIND. AND THE APPREHENSIVE THE VETERANS. AND THE THERAPIST AT THE BOTTOM LINE THE IN THE OF EACH PLANE INCIDENT. THE THERAPIST THE DOCTORS ALL NOTICE THAT THE VETERAN AFTER THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE PAIN ZIP IS VERY RECEPTIVE TOWARD. MEDICAL TREATMENT COUNSELING AND SO FORTH BECAUSE THE CREATIVITY. KNOCKS DOWN THE WALLS OF BEING. DIVISIVE ARE BEING OF WITH HILL OR THE PTSD SYNDROMES AND SO THEREFORE THE HEALING PROCESS OF ART. AT. THE BATES THROUGH CREATIVITY. AND THROUGH THESE PAINS SIPS I WAS ABLE TO PROVE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND NINE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. TO THE EARLY DATE OF CURRENT THAT PAIN SOUPS OR ESSENTIALS. MANY OF THE STAFF I'D I DON'T WANT TO NAME ANY NAMES WHO WERE VERY VERY RESISTANCE TO IT SO THEREFORE I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY SUPPORT. TO THE POINT WHERE BEING A VETERAN. AND STAYING TRUE TO THE ART. I'VE ACTUALLY PAWN JEWELRY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. AND I'M VERY PROUD TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT HAS TO GET DONE IN THE MILITARY WHENEVER WE HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT. UNDER ANY CONDITION IT HAS TO GET IT DONE. AND SO I FEEL THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH BECAUSE. ONLY ONE THIRD PAINS SIT. IT DID BRING ME TEARS WHEN. A VETERAN AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT CALLED ME. AND SAID THAT IF SHE HAD MISSED THAT PAINS. THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF VALUES IN THEN SO. CIVIL. SHE SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE. I GO THROUGH THE VA FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE. AND SO I STRUGGLE WITH MAJOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT. WOULD SAY WHILE YOUR MISSION IS WELL MEANING. YEAR TWO SMALL. HOLD VETERANS ARE REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN ART. AND I WAS SAY YOU WANNA BET. SO. I FORM THE VETERANS OUR VENUE AS AN ARTIST BECAUSE MY. MY MOTHER WAS IN THE ARMY. SHE WAS A COLONEL.

I WANTED TO BE A PART OF THE OPERATION TO HUNT DOWN AND DESTROY THE PEOPLE WHO ATTACKED US. FINALLY IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE. MY ARMY RESERVE UNIT WAS ACCEPTING VOLUNTEERS. BUT AFTER BEING MOBILIZED WE WERE DIVERTED TO IRAQ Y. SERVED IN MOSEL FOR A YEAR WHILE ATTACKS THE SECOND INFANTRY DIVISIONS. STRYKER BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM OUT OF FORT LEWIS WASHINGTON. MY JOB WAS TO SAFEGUARD CIVILIANS ON THE BATTLEFIELD. AND I WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO OVER TWO THOUSAND DISPLACED REFUGEES. SERVING OUR MILITARY. AT BEING A PART OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR. WAS THE MOST SEMINAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. IT ALSO GREATLY AFFECTED ME. I WAS IN COMBAT ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THE WEEK I FLEW HOME. AND I COULD NOT GET THE WAR OUT OF MY HEAD. IT WAS LIKE IT PLAYED LIKE A MOVIE INSIDE MY HEAD NONSTOP. CONSTANT REOCCURRING IMAGES OF DEAD CHILDREN HAUNTED ME. I WAS HYPER VIGILANT AT ALL TIMES I WAS ALWAYS ANGRY I COULDN'T SLEEP I WAS DEPRESSED. AND IT FELT LIKE THE WAR WAS LIKE A LEAD BLANKET LYING ON TOP OF ME SUFFOCATING ME. IT WAS AS IF MY BODY WAS HOME BUT MY MIND AND SPIRIT WERE STILL IN IRAQ. I COULDN'T ESCAPE THIS PAIN AND ONE NIGHT I DECIDED THE ONLY WAY TO BE FREE FROM IT WAS TO TAKE MY LIFE. I SELF MEDICAID WITH A BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS AND SET MY LIVING ROOM WITH A LOADED GLOCK PISTOL IN MY MOUTH. I STARTED TO PULL THE TRIGGER. IT WASN'T THAT I WANTED TO DIE. IT'S JUST THAT I COULDN'T BEAR LIVING ANYMORE. SOMETHING STOPPED ME AND THE NEXT DAY I WANT TO THE OAKLAND BUT CENTER AND I GOT HELP. I RELUCTANTLY ADMIT THAT AT TIMES IT FEELS AS IF THE WAR BROKE ME. THERE IS A LOSS OF INNOCENCE THAT YOU CAN NEVER GET BACK. I WAS EXTREMELY PROUD TO DEFEND OUR GREAT NATION AND I WOULD DO IT AGAIN WITHOUT HESITATION. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR WAR FIGHTERS ARE NOT MACHINES. WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS AND WAR IS NOT AN ACTUAL HUMAN ENDEAVOR. WHEN YOU SPEND A YEAR OF YOUR LIFE OF PEOPLE ACTIVELY TRYING TO KILL YOU EVERY DAY. IT CAN TAKE A TOLL ON YOUR SOUL. SO FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS I TRIED EVERYTHING. I COULD EVERY FORM OF THERAPY. TO BECOME WHOLE AGAIN. I BATTLE WITH DEPRESSION AT TIMES I WAS OVERCOME WITH DESPAIR. THAT I FOUND DIABLO THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE I FINALLY BEEN AT PEACE. DIABLO TAKES VETERANS ON AN INTENSE JOURNEY LIKE NO WHETHER IT'S A JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY. A JOURNEY OF FACING YOUR DEMONS IN WAYS THAT NO OTHER FORM OF THERAPY CAN. A MODEL OF EXPLORING MOVEMENT AND DANCE. AND THE WAY THAT FREES US HAS ENABLED ME TO LET GO OF MY ANGER SEE THE BEAUTY IN MYSELF AND OTHERS. AND HAS PROVIDED ME THE TOOLS TO LIVE A POSITIVE PRODUCTIVE LIFE. SPECIFICALLY DIABLO USES A MODEL THAT REPLICATES THE SENSE OF TRIBE. THAT MANY VETERANS LONG TO HAVE AGAIN. IT THEN BUILDS ON THE TRUST THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY AND CHALLENGES US. MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY IN WAYS THAT MAKE US REALIZE THE BARRIERS. BUT IF SHACKLED OUR LIVES ARE MERELY ILLUSIONS AND THAT WE HAVE THE POWER. AND RESILIENCY TO OVERCOME THEM. THEY'RE ONLY A COUPLE TIMES IN MY LIFE. WHAT I FULLY FELT THAT I WAS LIVING IN THE MOMENT? COMBAT. I PERFORMING WITH DIABLO. I HAVE. FINALLY FOUND TRUE CATHARSIS. OUR PROGRAM HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT WE'RE INVITED TO THE KENNEDY CENTER IN WASHINGTON DC. FOR PERFORMED A SOLD OUT CROWDS IN THE NATION'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS FORMING ARTS CENTER. I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS PART BASED PROGRAMS AS A MEANS OF HELPING OUR VETERANS TO DEAL WITH THE REINTEGRATION ISSUES AND HELP THEM WITH THE PROCESS OF HEALING. PARK BASED STRATEGIES HELP IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATING THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS INTO THE VETERANS COMMUNITY. OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THIS INTO A NATIONAL PROGRAM. BUT WE WANT TO START HERE IN OUR HOME STATE. WITH TWO MILLION VETERANS CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST VETERANS POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY. SADLY. THE INSANITY OF WAR IS STILL A DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF OUR SPECIES. WHEREAS WAR REVEALS THE UGLY SIDE OF HUMANITY PART. IS THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC THAT REVEALS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF HUMANITY. DIABLO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR WAR FIGHTERS TO REGAIN THEIR HUMANITY HE'LL FROM THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF COMBAT. AND MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS. IT'S A MODEL THAT ALSO PROVIDES A BRIDGE TO THE CIVIL MILITARY DIVIDE. LESS THAN HALF OF THEM EXCUSE ME. THE LESS THAN HALF A PERCENT OF THE U. S. POPULATION HAS TAKEN ON THE ENTIRE BURDEN. OF FIGHTING OUR WARS IN THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS. OTHER THAN MILITARY FAMILIES VIRTUALLY NO ONE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY IS AFFECTED BY THESE WARS AND THE GAP IN UNDERSTANDING. ARE VETERAN POPULATION IS GROWING WIDER. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE OUR VETERANS BACK INTO CIVILIAN SOCIETY. THAT SOCIETY HAS TO HAVE SOME STAKE IN UNDERSTANDING OF THE VETERAN POPULATION. THE DIABLO MODEL DOESN'T JUST HELP OUR VETERANS LIKE MYSELF FEEL BUT IT PROVIDES A CATALYST OF UNDERSTANDING FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AS WELL. SEEING US PERFORM HEARING OUR STORIES AND ENGAGING US IN THE QUEUE AFTER THAT PERFORMANCE IS. ALL HELP FURTHER THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT VETERANS GO THROUGH WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE NEED AND HOW YOU CAN HELP. THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ANYTHING DOESN'T NO GOOD UNLESS IT'S CONTEXTUALIZE IN A BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM. IT PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH A BASIS ON HOW TO ACT UPON THAT KNOWLEDGE. DIABLOS COLLABORATION WITH CIVILIANS IN VETERANS PROVIDES THIS CRUCIAL PIECE. IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE MAIN ISSUES ARE AREAS. WE NEED HELP. THOSE AREAS ARE LEGITIMACY FINDING. AND EXPANSION. WE ASK THAT YOU HELP LEGITIMIZE PART AS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF HELPING VETERANS. WE NEED BETTER ACCESS TO PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FUNDING. AND WE NEED HELP WITH EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM BEYOND THE LOCAL AREAS TO GIVE OTHER VETERANS WIDER ACCESS TO THIS. AND THESE OTHER PROGRAMS. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE GREATEST GIFT. BUT YOU CAN GIVE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING IS THE GIFT OF LIFE. AND JOCK KIND ARE DIRECTOR JENNIFER CHANG OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THEIR DANCERS HAVE GIVEN ME THAT GIFT. THIS WORK HAS SAVED MY LIFE. I WAS ALMOST ONE OF THE STATISTICS THAT TO READ ABOUT. I WAS ALMOST ONE OF THOSE TWENTY TWO A DAY. THIS WORK. THIS JOURNEY THIS PROCESS. HAS CHANGED MY LIFE DIDN'T SAVE MY LIFE AND WE WANT TO SHARE IT WITH OTHER VETERANS. SO PLEASE SUPPORT US IN THIS ENDEAVOR TO POSITIVELY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THOSE WHO ARE DEDICATED TO KEEPING OUR COUNTRY SAFE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR. ALRIGHT. ONE NEXT YEAR FROM MEMBERS. YEAH. FROM SOUTH DAKOTA. ALSO SERVED IN IRAQ. YEAH. HELLO I'M MEMBER WAY THINK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY. I WAS IN THE ARMY FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND. I'M AN ARTISTS I WORK AT CALOTTERY INSTITUTE OF THE ARTIST PROGRAM MANAGER I'M A COMBAT VETERAN. I A DEPLOYED TO IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. AS AN AMMUNITION SPECIALISTS THERE ARE FOUR WOMEN IN MY UNITS. ONE OF WHICH I WORKED WITH AND SO BEING A WOMAN IN THE MILITARY PRESENTS ITS OWN SET OF CHALLENGES AND ONE OF THEM BEING THAT THERE'S NOT VERY MANY OF US. WHEN PEOPLE IMAGINE A SOLDIER THEY OFTEN DON'T THINK OF SOMEONE THAT LOOKS LIKE ME. AND THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES OF WOMEN NOT BEING RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR SERVICE I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF THEM AND PEOPLE. ASKING WOMEN VETERANS AT THE VA AFTER THERE TO PICK UP THEIR HUSBANDS OR. AND. THEIR IN THEIR FATHERS SOON RECENTLY ASKED ME IF I WAS A DOCTOR AT THE VA WHICH THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT I GUESS MAYBE. I MET WOMEN VETERANS AND AFTER SEPARATING FROM SERVICE THEY MUST WAIT THE EXPERIENCES FROM THEIR MINDS. LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENS THEY DON'T GO TO THE VA FOR RESOURCES THEY HAVE ACCESS TO. AND BEING A WOMAN IN THE MILITARY CAN BE A LONELY EXPERIENCE AFTER COMING BACK SOMEHOW BECOMES MORE ISOLATED AND. A FEMALE VETERAN IS THE TWO POINT TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HER OWN TO TAKE HER OWN LIFE IN A CIVILIAN WOMAN. I AFTER I CAME BACK FROM IRAQ IT AND TALK ABOUT IT I WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT FIVE YEARS AFTER MY DEPLOYMENT TO START MAKING WORK ABOUT THE MILITARY. AND SERVICE. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO SHARE. AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT VETERANS MAKING OUR WORKERS TALKING ABOUT IT ON BUILDING A COMMUNITY AND ST ACTIVE WITH THAT COMMUNITIES. AND ABOUT STAYING ALIVE. THE FOLLOWING IMAGES IS NEXT TO IMAGES ARE FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO ART COMMISSION. THAT EXHIBITION NOT ALONE I HAD THE EXHIBITION WAS IN PART FUNDED BY THE CDC VETERAN PROGRAM. HERE'S ANOTHER IMAGE OF MY WORK. AND WHAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT TO ME. ABOUT THIS SHOW WAS THAT I GOT TO MEET MORE ART AS SOON VETERANS THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE SPACE. EXHIBITIONS CAN BE A PLACE TO SHARE IDEAS AND STORIES AND ASK QUESTIONS. AND MY IN BOX FILLED WITH MESSAGES FROM VETERAN WOMEN EXPRESSING THAT THEY SAW MY WORK AND HEARD MY STORIES. AND FOR THEM IT WAS ON POINT I'D FEEL GOOD FOR THEM TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE WAS MAKING WORK AND THAT THEIR EXPERIENCE WASN'T AS ISOLATED AS I ONCE THOUGHT. THIRTY THESE IMAGES I KIND OF SAW. THEIR GRASSROOT OF VETERAN OUR PROGRAMS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND ONE SUCH UNOFFICIAL PROGRAM WAS AND I UC BERKELEY AYE AARON TOOL THE CERAMIC TACK OPENED UP ONE OF THE UC BERKELEY I WORKSHOPS. I CERAMIC TECH OR SHOT. AND FOR TO EGG WEEKS WE'VE MADE WORK WE DESCENDED UPON BERKELEY WE HAD NO MONEY TO FUND THIS PROGRAM. BUT WE MADE IT HAPPEN AYE WE SLEPT IN EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY OF AARON'S HOME AYE WE MAKE PAPER WE THREE POTS. AND WE PUT ON AN EXHIBITION GALLERY AYE WE WENT WE HUNG OUT AYE WE WENT CAMPING RATE DINNER AT THIS POINT I WAS LIVING IN OHIO AND FINISHING MY GRAD PROGRAM. AND. OVER A YEAR LATER I GOT A JOB AT CLARKE INSTITUTE AND I INVITED VETERANS TO MAKE PRINTS AND OUR SPACE AND WE SHARED IDEAS AND COLLABORATE AND. AND WE HAD FUN. AND THIS IS AN IMAGE. TRUE CAMERON THE ARTIST BEHIND COMBAT PAPER COMBAT PAPER IS PAPER MADE OUT OF MILITARY UNIFORMS. TRUE WAS AWARDED A FELLOWSHIP THROUGH MY ORGAN IS ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM AND WORK WITH ANOTHER NONPROFIT CALLED PLANTING JUSTICE. CLINTON JUSTICE EMPLOYEES MAN TRANSITIONING OUT OF PRISON. THEY WORK TOGETHER AND USE JURIES TECHNIQUES TO MAKE PAPER OUT OF PRISON UNIFORMS. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PARENTS THAT VETERANS AND FORMER PRISONERS WORKING TOGETHER ON BUILDING A COMMUNITY ENSURING AND SKILLS. I VETERANS HOW TO DO IT DESIRE TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND TO HELP. AND ALSO DEEPLY DEEPLY INTERESTED AND HOW VETERANS AFTER THE USER GI BILL AND HOW THEY'RE OUT OF SCHOOL. AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS HOW DO THEY SUSTAIN CAREERS ONE ACADEMIC JOBS ARE THIN IAN HOW CAN WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT VETERAN. IN OUR CAREERS. SO THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE PRINT STUDIO WHERE I WORK ON WE LAUNCHED OUR FIRST VETERAN RESIDENCY PROGRAM LAST YEAR. AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I BROUGHT TO COLLAGE. I MANDATE I MANAGE SEVEN RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND THE VETERAN ART PROGRAM IS ONE OF TIME. BECAUSE PRIMARILY A PRINTMAKING STUDIO WE HAVE AT SHE IN THE FOG THE SCREEN CRANIUM LETTERPRESS AND NEW MEDIA. ARE FOR SOME VETERANS IT WAS THEIR FIRST TIME WORKING IN THIS MEDIUM. THIS AWARD PROVIDED THEM WITH THE STATE SEN. A CLASS AND OBVIOUSLY THE STUDIO RESIDENCY AND ALSO AN EXHIBITION IN OUR GALLERY SPACE. THE CURRENT OWNER NAM. YEAH YEAH. KIND OF I WANTED WELCOME CENTER NIELSEN JIM NIELSEN IS WONDERFUL MEMBERS THE STATE SENATE THE DEAN OF THE SENATE. AND A GREAT CHAMPION FOR VETERANS FORMER CHAIR OF THE OF THE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CURRENT VICE CHAIR BELIEVE. AND WERE WERE ON A PANEL HERE SENATOR RELATING TO VETERANS VOICES USER. PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF VETERANS ENGAGE OF THE ARTS AND WE'RE HEARING FROM AMBER. I WAS PRESENTING HER EXPERIENCE IS THE IRAQ WAR VET. CITIZENS MY LAST SLIDE AND I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT THIS IS SO MUCH MORE THAN VETERANS MAKING ARE WORTH IT'S A SURVIVAL PLAN. SO MANY VETERANS I'VE TALKED TO AND DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE ARTS PROGRAMS IF THEY ACCIDENTALLY FELL INTO WARRIOR RIDING A WRITER'S COMBAT PAPER THAT ARE. BECAUSE IT PROVIDED A COMMUNITY AND OUTLETS AND SMEWHERE TO BE. AND IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY CONNECTED IT'S KIND OF A NETWORK. AND. WOULD AS WINTER GRASS GOING NOTICES SOME VETERAN ARTISTS SHIED AWAY FROM THE WORK BEING CATEGORIZED AS VETERAN ARTS THEY WERE AFRAID THAT THEY'D BE CONSIDERED ART THERAPY OR HOBBYISTS. I ASKED A MENTOR HOW SHOULD UNPACK THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING I SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT. ANY TOLD ME THAT THAT WAS RIDICULOUS THAT ALL ART IS ART THERAPY AND S. HEAT THE WORK THAT YOU MAKE IS NOT THERAPEUTIC THING YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY. OPEN HERE. BOB A FANTASTIC PERSPECTIVES WE REALLY FAST TO APPRECIATE EACH AND EVERYONE OF UNICOR SUCH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES TO. COULD CHRISTOPHER CAN I START WITH YOU AS I LOVE TO JUST ASK YOU BET YOU DO YOU SPOKE A VERY ELOQUENTLY ABOUT JAVELIN I I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BUT. I I KNOW YOU ALSO WERE THE FOUNDER THE WORDS FOR PEACE THEATER AND I LOVE YOU SPIEGEL ABOUT THAT TOO. SURE. I DISCOVERED ACTING AS A FORM OF CATHARSIS TO DEAL WITH SOME OF MY ISSUES COMING BACK FOR MORE. AND SOME OF MY THEATER MATES AND FOR ME THAT THERE IS A GROUP OF IRAQI ACTORS THEY WERE INVITED TO THE OREGON SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL IN THE FORM. APPARENTLY THEY WERE THE FIRST GROUP OF ACTORS IN IRAQ THERE WERE EVER ALLOWED TO PERFORM SHAKESPEARE LIVE. SO I THOUGHT WHAT AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY IF I CAN GET SOME IRAQ WAR AMERICAN IRAQ WAR VETERANS LIKE MYSELF. TO PARTNER WITH THEM AND DO A JOINT PRODUCTION AS A MEANS OF BRINGING THE TWO GROUPS TOGETHER TO HEAL. AND GREAT IDEA BUT THERE WAS NO MEANS TO GET IT DONE. SO FIGURES LATER AYE I FORMED MY OWN THEATRE COMPANY WARRIORS FOR PEACE THEATER. AND HAS BASICALLY TWO FOLD MISSION ONE WE USE SHAKESPEARE THERE AS A FORM OF CATHARSIS ARE VETERANS. AND THE THE LARGER GOAL THE NEXT PHASE TO BRING. BUT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. TOGETHER WITH VETERANS FROM OUR KIND AND DO A JOINT PRODUCTION AS A MEANS OF HEALING AND BUILDING P.. I'M TALKING SPECIFICALLY. VETERAN VETERANS FROM COUNTRY EITHER BEEN AT WAR WITH OUR HAVE TOP RELATIONS WITH. THE IDEA HERE IS THAT IF WE THE VETERANS WHO FOUGHT THESE WARS CAN COME TOGETHER IN PEACE THEN WHY CAN'T EVERYBODY ELSE. IN MY PHILOSOPHY IS ARTS TRANSCENDS POLITICS AND BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER. AND SO NOW WE ARE WE'VE BEEN WE WERE DOING. WORKSHOPS WHERE PEOPLE COME TOGETHER AND EXPLORE SHAKESPEARE AND IT PROVED TO BE A PROFOUNDLY HEALING CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE. TO GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES IN RECENT. I HAVE. PRIVACY DONORS PLAYS WITH PARTICULAR GROUPS VETERANS SURE. WELL WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE. AND PRODUCTION PRE PRODUCTION TO DO A FILM ADAPTATION OF JULIUS CAESAR. AND AT AND A STAGE PRODUCTION AS WELL IN FACT AND WE TO BE COLLABORATING WITH DIABLO TO ADD SOME DANCE PIECES INTO IT WHAT JULIUS CAESAR AMONG OTHER THINGS A STORY ABOUT WAR TO WORRY ABOUT THE TRAIL AND ASSASSINATION AND. LOSS AND. IT. OUR COUNTRY'S BEEN WAR FOR ALMOST SEVENTEEN YEARS AND HIS OF THIS IS ABOUT PLAY ABOUT WAR SO MY FOR MY THINKING IS WHAT WE MODERNIZE IT. AND CAST A LOT OF VETERANS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE WARS BECAUSE WHAT THEY CAN BRING. TO THAT IS INCREDIBLE THE BREADTH OF UNDERSTANDING OF HAVING EXPERIENCED COMBAT IN WAR IS SOMETHING THAT NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO. WE ALSO WANT TO MODERNIZE IT AND BENT. GENDER MEN SOME ROLES. AND GIVE SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL ROLES LIKE MARC ANTHONY TO TWO WOMEN ACTORS. WE WANT TO HAVE A VERY ETHNICALLY DIVERSE CAST. AND SO THAT WERE JUST MODERNIZING IT AND IN MANY POSITIVE WAYS. AND THAT ALL U. S. VETS IN THIS PARTICULAR FRICTION ARE. AND IT CRACKED AND CIVILIANS. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT. CURRENT. YEAH PLEASE ANTHONY IF I MAY INTERJECT MYSELF THERE'S A MISSILE WHERE YOU KIND OF HAD A. WARM SPOT WITH ME. AT FIFTY THOUSAND INSPIRATION AND. MY REMARKS. MAJOR SPEECHES OR JUST EVEN ONE ON ONE. I OFTEN QUOTE SHAKESPEARE'S EXAMPLE OF IN JULIUS CAESAR AND BRUTUS AND CASSIUS AND YOU'LL APPRECIATE THIS ARE. DECIDING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THE INVADING ARMY. AND. CASH IS SAYS NO WE'LL GET IN THE DEFENSIVE POSTURE AND COUNTER ATTACK AND THEN BROUGH SAYS NO AND IN SHAKESPEARE'S LOVELY WORDS THERE'S A TIDE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN WHICH YOU'VE TAKEN AT THE FLOOD. AT LEAST A FORTUNE OMITTED ALL THE VOYAGE OF YOUR LIVE SHOW BE BOUND IN THE SHALLOWS IN THE MISERIES. TO ME THAT WAS ALWAYS APPLICABLE TO HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES TO. NOT LIVE OUR LIVES AND SHELVES IN THE MISERIES AND THE. THAT THAT JUST REMINDS ME OF OF THAT VALUE. AND THAT I WANTED US TO SPEAK ALSO FROM MY EXPERIENCE THE BOARD OF PRISON TERMS AND HOW ARTS AND CORRECTIONS REALLY. IT WAS IT IS VERY HELPFUL. IT KIND A DIMINISHED FOR MANY MANY YEARS BUT WE WERE ABLE TO IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS IN THE BUDGET. MAKE A COMEBACK AND TOOK IN THE LAST I THINK TWO YEARS SELF. I I SURE APPRECIATE YOUR. LEFT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND BRINGING THAT KIND OF THERAPY. TO OUR VETERANS. THIS IMAGE AND SAID SENATOR NIELSEN ALSO THE VICE CHAIRMAN BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND SO. YOU KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MANY. THINGS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE IS WHAT WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT MORE THESE PROGRAMS. CONTINUED CAN YOU SPEAK TO FIVE YOU SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY ABOUT YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES KENNEDY WE SPEAK TO. OF THE LIFE OF SOMEONE ANOTHER VETERAN YOU'VE WORKED WITH AND THEY'RE ONE OF YOUR RESPECTIVE PROGRAMS WHO HAS BEEN PROFOUNDLY TOUCHED BY. THESE ARTS PROGRAMS ANY ANY PARTICULAR ANECDOTE OR STORY FROM SOMEONE ELSE I CAN. PROVIDE I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WHERE. PSYCHOLOGISTS AT THE WEST LOS ANGELES VA. HAVE EXPERIENCED THREE PARTICULAR VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN TO THROUGH THREE PAIN SIMPSON SAID THAT THEY ARE MORE RECEPTIVE THEY'RE LESS COMBATIVE AND ARGUING WITH ME. HERE CALM SO THAT NOW I CAN REACH IN. AND FURTHER IN AND AND ABLE TO COUNSEL. SO THROUGH THE PAIN SIMPSON AT THE SAME TIME ONE VETERAN WHO WAS LIVING OFF OF. UNEMPLOYMENT. AND HE WAS A VERY TALENTED ARTIST AND I WAS ABLE TO. THROUGH MY ART SESSIONS IN ADDITION TO PAINS SIEVE TO INCORPORATE THE BUSINESS ACKERMAN AND ABLE TO LEAD HIM TO DO CERTAIN TESTS OF IMMEDIATE INFORMATION. HE WAS ABLE TO LEVERAGE HIS ART. OF FINE A SMALL STUDIO AND BECOME. FINANCIALLY SELF SUFFICIENT. SO AND THAT'S A SINCE OF NO INDEPENDENCE NGUYEN MANY OF US. I CAN SAY I HOPE YOU GUYS CAN CHALLENGE ME ON THIS. A VETERAN PERIOD IS SORT OF AN INDEPENDENT PERSON. OF GETTING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IS IS OKAY FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS WHAT YOU EXPECT TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT YOU'RE VERY. OF YOUR PRIDE ALONG WITH THE OF THE SKILLS THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO EXECUTE AND SO ONE AND VETERAN. HAS ED VOID. PHONE OF DEPENDENCY. THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT AND THE EMPOWERMENT WITHIN AND THAT'S ANOTHER MEANS OF ART. ARE TO EMPOWER WITHIN AND THEY'RE ABLE TO. BRING YOUR LIFE BACK TO FULL FULL AND BECOME AS A FEEL I WANT TO BE I WON A TRIBUTE TO THE SOCIETY. YES I SERVED MY COUNTRY YES I PAID. IN THAT IN SOME SENSE PRICE FOR FREEDOM. BUT I AM NOW STILL SUFFICIENT SO THROUGH MY PAIN SINCE ARTS SESSIONS WHERE IT DEPLETED IN SOME SENSE THE EMPOWERMENT OF PUTTING ALL THE COMPONENTS TOGETHER. HISTORY. I'M. GOTTEN GARY'S OURS STONE AYE I DID I WAS SO STRUCK BY YOUR STORY KEEP YOU. THE THIS THIS YOUNG THIS YOUNG MAN THAT YOU WERE. DIDN'T KEY PRIORITIES OF THE END OF THE STORY WITH THIS OR DID HE WAS OR SOME SORT OF EXPLOSION BASED ON LAND MINES ARE HE STEPPED ON A LAND MINE WHILE. OUR. DAY BELONGS TIME AND I STILL DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST HOW THE STORY GOES I DON'T KNOW IF. I SHOT HIM. OR AS PART OF THE STORY SAYS ONE WAY BY PUT I WROTE THIS STORY I WAS STILL IN THE FOG OF WAR. HOUSE STILL COMING OUT OF ARE STILL GOING THROUGH THERAPY AND IN NO FOR SURE. BY. THERE IS A PART MATT MY AND MY OWN MEMORIES THAT I DON'T NO WHAT HAPPENED THERE. THAT I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOT HIM MANY STEP AND HE STEPPED ON A LAND MINE. I DON'T KNOW THE STEPPED ON A LAND MINE AND BECAUSE MY RIVAL TO GO OFF. SO THERE'S A SPEAK BUSINESS GRAY AREA WITHIN THEIR AND I GO TO THERAPY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT SPACE OUT IT'S JUST GONE. BUT BECAUSE. SO IT'S A ALL ADORED THIS ORGANIZATION HAS HELPED ME CUT BUT THAT PART OF MY LIFE IN PERSPECTIVE AND ABLE TO WALK. NOT WALK AWAY FROM IT IT'S ALWAYS MANY A PART OF ME. BUT ITS. WIDE EYES BUT I'VE ROAD AND TAKE INTERVIEW ONE TIME WISE THAT IT'S LESS OF A MONKEY ON MY BACK. BUT MORE BLOOD MONKEY BECOME LOCK BOX ASIDE BESIDE ME NOW. AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S THEIR IN THEIR STANDS ON HERE THE KIND OF WORK CAN AND WITH EACH OTHER FROM THAT ONE. AND YOU KNOW DO SO SAY WE ALL IT IS THIS IS. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT COURSE BUT WHAT IT DES IS A SORT OF ALL THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT REACHES OUT TO THE COMMUNITY OF BUT. MANY MANY DIFERENT PARTS THE COMMUNITY THAT LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY ON THE VETERANS COMMUNITY.

HOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID IT'S? VETERANS. ARE INDEPENDENT IN VISUALS. BUT WE THRIVE IN A TRIBAL COMMUNITY. AND SO SAY ALL GIVES US I TRIED. AS THE GENERAL SAID IT'S. A GREAT PHRASE I'M A STILL AND I'M TAKEN FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRENGTH. IT'S AN AMAZING KIND OF GUY. RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH EACH OTHER WE HAVE CERTAIN WORKSHOPS AROUND OF ROUND TABLE WITH ONE ANOTHER WHERE SOMEONE HAS BROKEN DOWN. AND WAS NOT ABLE TO CONTINUE ON. AND I TOOK COMMUNITY A TRIBAL COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REACH INTO AND. TOUCH EACH OTHER AND HELP THEM BRING THE MUSCLES OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ALL OF US ON A REGULAR BASIS. ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMETHING'S COMING UP LIKE ON MY WAY IN HERE THEY'RE ALL ASKING ME ARE. YOU GOT THIS MAN YOU GONNA GET GOING TO GET AHEAD OF THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY.

PRESENT ELIZABETH WASHBURN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMBAT ARTS SAN DIEGO WHICH I. AND HAD DONE SOME WORK WITH ADAM AS WELL REGINALD GREEN U. S. NAVY RETIRED. VOLUNTEER INSTRUCT WITH THAT ARE. MAMBO HERNANDEZ SAMUEL HERNANDEZ OF OF OF RETIRED MARINE AND. MUSICIAN TEACHING ARTISTS FROM THE DEL MAR ASSOCIATION CULT AWARENESS AND ALSO. REBEKAH EVANDRO WHOSE. MUSIC THERAPIST IN AND WORKS TO CAMP PENDLETON AND THE CONCUSSION CARE CLINIC SO WE WELCOME YOU ALL. A CENTER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS ALLUDED TO WE HAVE. KNOWN DEFENSE IS A GENERAL HE SAID WORKS. FOR THE CREATIVE FORCES INITIATIVE WHICH IS A JOINT INITIATIVE OF THE NATIONALITY ARTS DEPARTMENT DEFENSE IN WASHINGTON DC. AND HE SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY EARLIER ABOUT POSTTRAUMATIC STRENGTH. RIGHT AND THE. THE WAYS IN WHICH THE ARTS IN THE HEALING ARTS CAN CAN PLAY WELL A ROLE IN IN IN AND STRENGTHENING VETERANS AND. AS THEY COME BACK FROM DRAMATIC EXPENSES AWARD THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT HAS BEEN THE THEME OF. OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION SO LET'S START WITH THAT WE DEAL AS MATH AND WE VERY MUCH WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT MY THE WAY I'M MISTER STONER AND YOU YOU STILL HERE. THE EARLY WALKER. SO IT IS WHAT IT IS OKAY WITH THE I LOVE THE IF IF WE COULD JUST TAKE A LOOK AT HIS BOOK. AND WE PROMISE TO GIVE IT BACK. OKAY YES MISS MISS WASHBURN VERY GOOD AFTERNOON BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND. ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. MY NAME IS ELIZABETH WATCH BURN ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR COMBAT ARTS SAN DIEGO. COMBAT ARTS IS A NON PROFIT. ART ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES POST NINE ELEVEN COMBAT VETERANS. AND TREATMENT FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND TV I. IN ADDITION WE SERVE TEENS INCARCERATED IN JUVENILE HALL. OUR PROGRAM INCLUDES ART CLASSES ART SHOWS. MEN TOURING PUBLIC ART OPPORTUNITIES. AND CULTURAL TOURS. WE SERVE AROUND A HUNDRED VETERANS YEAR AND OVER A CLOSE TO A THOUSAND BY JUVENILES. MY BACKGROUND IS IN A VISUAL ARTIST AND ART TEACHER WHO'S BEEN WORKING IN SAN DIEGO COMMUNITIES TEACHING OUR AND FACILITATING PUBLIC ART PROJECTS WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS. SPECIFICALLY A BEEN WORKING WITH WOUNDED WAR VETERANS FOR A LEAD IN YEARS. AT FIRST GLANCE ART MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LIKELY COMPANION TO A SOLDIER. BUT I'VE MORE STAR STORIES AND A TIME TO TELL TODAY ABOUT THE TOUGH MARINES. FINDING A LOT OF RELIEF FROM MAKING ART AND MAKING ART HELP THEM TO REGAIN A SENSE OF PURPOSE AFTER THE INTENSITY OF WAR. ONE EXAMPLE IS MARINE SERGEANT AARON RARE WHO SERVE TWO COMBAT TOURS IN IRAQ AS A TURRET GUNNER AARON'S PTSD SYMBOL SYMPTOMS STARTED DURING A SECOND DEPLOYMENT WHERE HE BEGAN HAVING INTENSE NIGHTMARES THAT LEAD TO CHRONIC INSOMNIA. BY THE TIME AARON GOT HOME FROM A SECOND DEPLOYMENT WHO IS NOT-ONLY NOT SLEEPING. BUT ALSO BEGIN ISOLATE TO AVOID ANXIOUS SITUATIONS THAT INCLUDED THINGS LIKE GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE DRIVING BEING IN PUBLIC AREAS. AND EVEN THOUGH HE WAS HOME AND OUT OF HARM'S WAY HE WAS UNABL TO TURN OFF THE HYPERVALENT VIGILANCE THAT HE HAD DEVELOPED WHILE HE WAS ON HIS COMBAT PATROLS IN MISSIONS IN IRAQ. INTERACTING WITH HIS WIFE AND FAMILY WITHOUT SEVERE ANXIETY AND AGITATION BECAME DIFFICULT AND HE BEGAN DRINKING HEAVILY. THANKFULLY HE SOUGHT OUT TREATMENT AND A NAVY SPONSORED PTSD CLINIC WHICH IS WHEN HE ENDED UP IN ONE OF OUR CLASSES AND. THAT'S WHAT HIS ARTWORK THAT HE DID. IN HER CLASS WHICH IS INTERESTING EGOS CHOSE THAT. ART MAKING BECAME A WAY FOR HIM TO EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS AND COMMUNICATE WHEN WORDS FAILED HIM. IN ADDITION THE ACT OF MAKING ART SLOWED HIS MIND DOWN AND PROVIDED HIM WITH SOME RELIEF THAT MADE THE MEET OTHER REALITIES OF HIS LIFE MORE MANAGEABLE. TODAY ERIN WORKS WITH COMBAT ARTS IN THE SAME CLINIC HE WAS TREATED IN HELPING OTHER SOME SERVICE MEMBERS TO USE ART TO HEAL AND CONNECT. AND IN ADDITION HE'S REMARRIED AND IS A FATHER FOR THE SECOND TIME. THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF ART HELPING VETERANS WITH PTSD TELLS THE STORY OF THE INDIVIDUAL VETERANS. WITH THAT WE WORK WITH AND THE NEUROSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BASED ON BRAIN PLASTICITY THAT IS BEING PUBLISHED SHOWS NUMERICAL DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE USE OF ART AND STRENGTHENING COGNITION. NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN BRAIN IMAGING HAVE ALLOWED SCIENTISTS TO VIEW BRAIN ACTIVITY DURING ART MAKING FOR EXAMPLE OUR LIGHTS UP A PLEASURE CENTER IN THE BULLET IN THE BRAIN THAT RELEASES DOPAMINE. THAT GOOD FEELING THE DOPAMINE ENCOURAGES AN INDIVIDUAL TO STAY IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WITHOUT FORGETTING THAT REGRETTING THE PAST OR FEARING THE FUTURE. THIS MINDFULNESS STATE HELPS TO DIMINISH NEGATIVE THOUGHT LOOPS MAKING ROOM FOR MORE COGNITIVE HEALTHY COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING THAT IS NOT WHOLLY RELIANT ON DRUGS. THE STUDIES ARE VERY USEFUL IN SUPPORTING OUR GOAL OF LESS DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS AND MORE ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES LIKE ART BEING PRESCRIBED TO VETERANS. ART IS A MEDICINE THAT CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY REALIZE BY A VETERAN TO HELP THEM THROUGH MOMENTS OF ANXIETY AND STRESS. IN ADDITION THE COMMUNITY BASED ENGAGEMENT ART PROGRAMS LIKE COMBAT ARTS PROVIDES TO THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN COMMUNITIES PROMOTES NOT ONLY AWARENESS BUT ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE TWO GROUPS TO CONNECT. THE ART PROJECTS ALSO REQUIRE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SELF DETERMINATION ON THE PART OF THE VETERAN THAT OTHERWISE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MATERIALIZE WHEN DRUGS AND INSUFFICIENT TALK THERAPY. ARE THE ONLY SOURCES OF MEDICINE AVAILABLE. BUT VETERAN HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN SOCIETY EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED THEIR TOURS OF DUTY IT WOULD BENEFIT EVERYONE INVOLVED IF WE HAVE HIGHER EXPECTATIONS OF A VETERANS. AND PROVIDED ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES AS OUR THINKS FOR THEIR SERVICE. COMEDIAN GAUGE MEANT PROGRAMS ARE ALSO VERY ECONOMICALLY FRIENDLY AND TO NOT HAVE A LONG WAIT TIMES IN INSTEAD OF OVERWHELMED GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BEING TAXED. WITH HELPING VETERANS FIND ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR HEALING CIVILIAN COMMUNITY PRIMARY PROVIDERS WITH PROVEN TRACK RECORDS SERVING VETERANS. CAN BE CONTRACTED BY LOCAL AND STATE AND AGENCIES TO FILL HOLISTIC PRESCRIPTIONS THAT THE HEALTH THIS MODEL OF CARE ARTS ON PRESCRIPTION WILL LESSEN THE LOAD OF VETERAN CARE FOR THE STATE AND CONNECT COMMUNITY PROVIDERS WITH VETERANS IN NED OF THEIR SERVICES. IN ORDER FOR THIS MODEL TO WORK HOWEVER. COMMUNITY PARTNERS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO VOLUNTEER THE SERVICES OR REYES OF THE NEEDED FUNDING OF FOCUS ON DEVELOPING CREATIVE AVENUES TO PAY FOR COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVE NEEDS TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. WHETHER IT'S CORPORATE SPONSORS YOU GET TAX INCENTIVES THE REALLOCATION OF EXISTING FUNDS OR OTHER FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS. MOVING FOR THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE CARE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND IS EVIDENCED BY MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF OPIATE ADDICTIONS AND SUICIDES AMONG VETERANS. COMMUNITY ARTS PROVIDERS CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR THE VERY ARRESTING OUR. IT WILL PASS YOU PROLONG FOR A FEE TO. BOB WHAT I HEAR FROM. FROM MR GREEN. REGINALD GREEN THANKS FOR LETTING ME. HER LIFE STORY. WILL START OFF WITH THE VIDEO FOR A HALF. OKAY. PHONE GONNA START I'M. FOR BEING LIVE STREAM THAT'S WAY OKAY. RETIRED NAVY THAT. AND ALSO. VOLUNTEER INSTRUCTOR FOR THAT ARE SO I'M GONNA BEGAN WITH THE VIDEO FOR WHERE WERE YOU TO POINT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SERVICE. OVER THE PLACE FOR A LOWER SHOULD. YEAH I DID. TWO SEVEN MONTH DEPLOYMENTS. WHEN I WAS COME BACK SUPPORT SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YOU WANNA COME FROM BLOWS HIMSELF UP AND MAKE SOME FIRE THAT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. ORG IS A VETERAN ORGANIZATION STARTED TO PROMOTE HEALING THROUGH ART WE BRING VETERANS TOGETHER. INCOMING GIVE THEM A PURPOSE. AND WHEN IT TAUGHT ITS FIRST. THROUGH TO TODAY WORD OFFERS MANY FORMS OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION ITS MISSION REMAINS. REMEMBER THIS THE LAST FOR THE NEXT THOUSAND YEARS IN THE FUTURE OF FREE ART CLASSES THE VETERANS ALL AROUND SO SAN DIEGO. AND AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THIS. USING SNAKES THAT DATE BACK ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA THEY SEEK TO CREATE NOT JUST ART. BUT A WAY OF ADDRESSING DRAMATICALLY.

I'M VERY HONORED AND HUMBLED TO BE UP HERE. AND AND BE ABLE TO SHARE NOW A PART OF THE CREATIVE FORCES INITIATIVE THAT GENERALLY THEN SPOKE ABOUT ON A BRIEF EARLIER FROM. AND SO AS FAR AS MY REPRESENTATION HERE I'M HERE AS A CREATIVE ARTS THERAPISTS I AM A BOARD CERTIFIED MUSIC THERAPIST OUTSIDE MY MASTERS IN EDUCATION ON THERE ARE SCIENTISTS WHO HAD A BRIDGE IN THAT. ON THEIR ULTIMATELY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEM HOW YOU FEELING YOUR DRUMMING IN MAKING MUSIC AND GAMES AND TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE RESEARCH SIDE OF THAT HE WAS WELL AS A CRATE OF OXIDE. AND AND SO WHAT CREATIVE ARTS THERAPISTS ARE INCREASE OF ARTS THERAPIES ARE AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE WHO CAME UP HERE TODAY ARTISTS. DANCERS THEATER. MUSIC AND CREATIVE WRITING ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN TOUCHED UPON TODAY IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM AND SO WHERE PROVIDERS THAT DO AN APPROVED ACCREDITED. AND EDUCATION AND DEGREE BACHELORS MASTERS OR DOCTORAL. OUT IN CREATIVE ARTS THERAPIES AND THIS IS USING THE ARTS AS A VEHICLE AND CATALYST FOR I'VE REACHING NON MUSICAL NON ARTISTIC. GOALS AND. SO THROUGH CREATIVE FORCES WE ARE EMBEDDED IN THE CLINIC AND WE DEFINITELY ACKNOWLEDGED ON THE IMPORTANCE IN THE POWER OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS HAVE SPOKEN TODAY. IN THE CLINIC AS CREATIVE ARTS THERAPISTS AND WE WORK ON FUNCTIONAL REHABILITATION AS WELL AS SO MOTOR SPEECH. I AS WELL AS COGNITION AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH SCHOOLS AND THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL QUOTE FROM A SERVICE MEMBER THAT I WAS. VERY GRATEFUL AND BLESSED TO WORK WITH MISSES HIS WIFE ACTUALLY SAYING IT'S TRULY A MIRACLE. WITHOUT WHAT CREATIVE FORCES HAS DONE FOR WHO LOUISE CAPTAIN VELAR RIGHT THERE WHO WILL SEE AGAIN IN THE PRESENTATION AND WE COULDN'T HAVE IN MY FAMILY THE QUALITY OF LIFE WE HAVE. WE DON'T EVEN THINK WE ARE DISABLED ANYMORE WE CAN GO ANYWHERE WE DON'T SEE THE DISABILITY WE SEE THE POSSIBILITY AND THAT TO ME. NOT FOCUS ON THE CIVILITY THAT FOCUS ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT'S BEEN A THEME THAT. REALLY EVERYONE HAS HIGHLIGHTED HERE TODAY VERY IMPORTANT IN. THE DISCIPLINES. SO IT'S CREATIVE ARTS THERAPISTS IN CREATIVE FORCES WHERE IN BAGHDAD. AS THE GENERAL SAT ON ON MULTIPLE MILITARY INSTALLATIONS ACROSS THE NATION THESE ARE MOSTLY AT THE INTREPID SPIRIT CENTERS. WHICH ARE FUNDED BY THE INTREPID HOP BY FALLEN HEROES FIND AND THE MOST RECENT ONE OR TO TO ACTUALLY ARE ON. GREAT ART THERAPISTS THERE. AND SO REALLY I USING THE ARTS AS A CORE PART OF THE INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM. SOMETHING MRS MILLER TODAY SAID ABOUT ON THE ARTS ON SOMETHING NICE THERE REALLY IS AN ESSENTIAL PART IN SO WE REALLY BELIEVE AND THINK THIS MISSION AND WE SEE THROUGH THE WORK WE DO THAT THE ARTS ARE. A NEED TO HAVE RATHER THAN NICE TO HAVE AND SO THE WAY CREATE A FORCES PRESENTS THIS MISSION IS IN BATTING. A TEAM SO WE WORK ALONGSIDE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS RECREATION THERAPIST. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST TO REALLY PROVIDE THE ARTS AS A CORE OF THE TREATMENT. I'M LOOKING FROM A CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE WE LOOK AT THE ARTS ABOUT AS A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL WE DO ASSESSMENTS WE LOOK AT THE PATIENT AND THESE ROUNDS AND SO CREATIVE FORCES HAD THAT ALSO AND THE SERVICE MEMBER AT THE CORE BUT REALLY LOOKING AT. THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN THE DIFFERENT. CULTURES IN DYNAMICS AND AND. THE DIFFERENT LEVELS THAT EXISTS. FOR THE SERVICE MEMBER WHEN THEY LEAVE THE CLINIC AND THAT'S AND IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. AND LOOKING AT OUR NETWORK SO I THE CREATIVE FORCES REPRESENTATIVE AND CLINICIAN I DO. CORE CLINICAL WORK ON THE A CLINIC. SEEING PATIENTS EVERYDAY. ALSO I TIE IN WITH THE COMMUNITIES OF SOMETHING WE'VE DEVELOPED AT CAMP PENDLETON ALSO THROUGHOUT MANY OF THE INTREPID SPIRIT CENTERS IS SOMETHING CALLED THE CREATIVE ARTS CAFE. WHERE PATIENTS WERE STAFF AND CAN COME AT FAMILIES CAN COME AND PEOPLE PRESENT ARTWORK THAT THEY'VE CREATED MUSIC THAT THEY WERE IN? THEY DO DRUM INTERACTIVE'S AND THEY DO RELAXATION AND WELLNESS AND EVERY MONTH WE BRING AND SOMEONE FROM THE COMMUNITY. THAT ARE IS GOING TO BE HIGHLIGHTED NEXT MONTH WHICH IS WONDERFULLY PAD ON THE LIBRARY CAN MEN. AND WE'VE HAD THE OLD GLOBE THEATER. COMING SO WE REALLY PROVIDE THAT ARE BEGINNING STAGE OF A WARM HAND A FROM THE CLINIC TO THE COMMUNITY. WITH THE CREATIVE ARTS CAFE SO THAT POWER PERFORMANCE. THE CAPACITY IS MORE IN LINE. WITH OUR DIGITAL RESOURCE CENTER SOME OF OUR NATIONAL INITIATIVES AS WELL AS THE RESEARCH THAT WE PRODUCE SO A BIG PART OF. WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE SAYING THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE IS STRONG WE NEED THAT RESEARCH TO BE ABLE TO SHOW TO GET THAT DIANNE SO PEOPLE CAN REALLY SEE. YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE A MASCOT BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE. A PIECE OF MUSIC AND SO REALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE AND THE PROCESSES BEHIND THESE PRODUCTS OF THE ARTS. THESE ARE ALSO IN THE BINDERS THAT WERE ON THE PORTFOLIOS THAT WERE DISTRIBUTED ONE THAT'S REALLY KNEW THAT DID NOT MAKE IT IN THERE. IS THE. MUSIC THERAPY APPLIED TO COMPLEX A BLAST INJURY AND THAT'S A CASE REPORT THE SECOND AUTHOR ON THAT. REPORT IS THE PATIENT AND THAT'S. CAPTAIN LOUIS SEBELAH I'M SOME IS GOING TO SHARE TO BRIEF STORIES. OF THE ATTORNEY THAT HAD THE CREATIVE ARTS THERAPIES THIS PATIENT I WORKED WITH AT THE NATIONAL AND CHECK THAT CENTER OF EXCELLENCE AT WALTER REED WHEN HE. FIRST WAS INJURED AYE HE COULDN'T SPEAK HE WAS IN A COMA FOR FORTY DAYS AND AGAIN YOU CAN READ ABOUT HIS STORY ON THE OPEN ACCESS LINK THERE. OUT IT'S A GREAT STORY HIS WIFE IS ALSO I'M VERY MUCH A PART OF THAT PAPER IN HIS FAMILY. AND HE WAS IN A CALM HE COULDN'T SPEAKING THROUGH THE AMAZING WORK OF THE INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM AT WALTER REED AND HE WAS ABLE TO. AMERICA AND REHABILITATE MUSIC IS SUCH A BIG PART OF HIS REHABILITATION AND I THINK IT'S. MOVING FORWARD HE WHAT HE HAD PERFORMED. NOT ONLY AT THE KENNEDY CENTER IN THE LINING OF STATE UP THERE HE'S IN THE. SUMMER LIGHT. THAT'S HIM RIGHT THERE PLAYING DRUMS. FOR THIS INTERACTIVE DANCE MOVEMENT. AND MUSIC AND HIS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST IS RIGHT THERE. HE ALSO BUT I WAS ABLE TO PERFORM ALONGSIDE RENEE FLEMING AND THE NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AT LAST YEAR'S MEMORIAL DAY CAPITAL CONCERT SO GOING FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK. TO SINGING GOD BLESS AMERICA ON. THAT CAPITOL LAWN WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE I'M. AND I HOPE YOU AGAIN CAN I FIND HIS ARTICLE IN HIS STORY IT IS OPEN ACCESS EVERY PIECE OF RESEARCH CREATIVE FORCES. PUBLISHES IS OPEN ACCESS. ONE MORE RECENT ONES COME TO BRIDGE THE GAP OVER TO. CAMP PENDLETON MY WORK NOW WE WERE JUST OF HONOR TO HOST THE SECOND LADY FOR A. VISIT A FEW WEEKS AGO. AND MISS YOUNG MARINE HAD A SUDDEN BRAIN INJURY AND HE ACTUALLY WAS STATIONED AT QUANTICO AND HIS FIRST CARE WAS OUT WHAT'S A READER WHO'S ABLE TO START. I'M USING MUSIC IN HIS INITIAL CUTE PAGES PHASES OF RECOVERY WHAT'S REALLY NICE ABOUT THIS NETWORK IN THIS IS A GREAT STORY TO SHOW THAT. IS HE CAME HOME HE'S FROM BAKER I'M CALIFORNIA AND HE REALLY WANTS GET BACK HOME TOWARD THAT TO HIS FAMILY. AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO JUST DO THE HAND OFF FROM WALTER REED ARMY HE'S BEEN NOW WORKING WITH ME I'M IN MUSIC THERAPY AS PART OF HIS. AYE REHABILITATION AND HE'S ABLE TO BE HOME THAT'S A REALLY GREAT HOMECOMING STORY I THINK FOR HIM IN HIS NOT JUST IN HIS FIGHT AND HIS BATTLE THE IN HIS REHABILITATION HIS RECOVERY. AYE LIGHTS AND WITH A QUICK. OUT WRITING THAT WAS DONE BY ONE SERVICE MEMBERS AND THIS IS A COMPILATION OF THEIR OWN WRITING AS WELL AS ON SOME SONG LYRICS SAVE EXTRACTED TO PUT TOGETHER. SOME. SENATE SO OVER TO A NEW HORIZON AND RISING SIGN. AT WHAT COST DOES HE ACHIEVE VICTORY. THEMES OF SACRIFICE RACED THROUGH HIS MIND. MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE HYENAS NIPPING AT HIS INTENT. I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT I WANT AT THE MOMENT. BUT SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON WHAT IS BEST FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY. THIS IDEA OF IN THE FUTURE WILL HAVE TO BE FIGURED OUT SOON. OR MAYBE A DOZEN SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERESTING PEOPLE STILL DON'T. I'M STILL HAVING DIFFICULTY BLOCKING OUT THOUGHTS PENDING ISSUES AND PAST COMBAT RELATED EVENTS. TRYING TO TURN AWAY MAKES ME THINK OF THEM MORE AND IN DETAIL. HEARING HIDING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BLAME SOMEONE FOR YOUR OWN CONFUSION. CAN YOU FEEL THE RESISTANCE CAN YOU FEEL THE THUNDER. I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE IN THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING. OFFICE IS OPEN SEASON. THE MEDITATION A MUSIC RELEASE MY STRESS AND PAIN TEMPORARILY. I'M THINKING OF CHORES PROJECTS PROBLEMS I NEED TO RESOLVE BUT MUSIC ITSELF IS AN EFFECTIVE FORM OF THERAPY. SINGING SEEMS TO HELP A TROUBLED SOUL. ONE OF THESE DAYS IT WON'T BE LONG OUR REJOIN THEM IN A SONG. AND THEN JOIN THE FAMILY CIRCLE AT THE THRONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR YOUR WORKERS ARE VETERANS. CHRIS SHOULD. WELL GREAT GREAT STORIES. THAT THE FLOOR IS OPEN TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS AND. THEN APPEAR. THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'RE DOING WITH. OUR VETERANS AND. THANK YOU FOR VETERANS FOR YOUR SERVICE. IT WHETHER THINGS PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTED ON IS. THE DIVIDE BETWEEN. MILITARY LIFE AND CIVILIAN LIFE AND NOT JUST LIFE BUT SOCIETY EVEN AND THAT. AT AT AND. IT ACTUALLY HAD OF THIS DIVISION DEFECT THAT MAY CIVILIANS TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT MILITARY LIFE. IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE MANY OF THEM MAY BE POLICY MAKERS WHO ARE MAKING POLICIES AFFECTING OUR. PEOPLE THE MILITARY ARE VETERANS AS WELL. BUT SO I KNOW YOU'RE HERE FOCUSING MAINLY ON HOW THESE ARTS FOR HEALING BUT I'M ALSO WONDERING WHETHER SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT. IN TERMS OF ENGAGING THE ARTS TO ALSO HELP BECAUSE AS VETERANS YOUR GUY TRYING TO BEAT BACK INTO. OUR GENERAL SINCE CIVILIAN SOCIETY. THE ROLE ARTS CAN PLAY AND. BUILDING THOSE BRIDGES BETWEEN MILITARY LIFE ARE FORMER MILITARY WIFE AND. KERN SURVEILLANCE SOCIETY AND YOU CAN TELL ME OF A COMPLETELY WRONG ABOUT THIS. I HAVE. BUT I KNOW I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOU THOUGHT THAT MOTHER THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE ENCOUNTERED WHETHER YOU SEE A ROLE FOR THE ARTS IN THAT ARE YOU CAN TELL ME THAT. NO YEAH I COMPLETELY MISSED THE MARK WHEN IT COMES TO THIS DIVISION BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND MILITARY NNOVA. WHO ME WE HAVE A WE ALSO THE FROM TESTIFIED EARLIER TO THING ONE ANSWER IS WELL TOTALLY DIFFERENT? BUT FOR. CHRIS DARDEN LATER THINK I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT WHO I THINK. BETWEEN THE CIVILIAN LIFE IN THE AND CITIZENS AND THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED. ARI. IS VISUAL BEYOND WORDS. MEANING THAT YOU CAN HAVE AN EXHIBIT AND HAVE BEAUTIFUL WORKS THERE. INVITE PEOPLE WIN. TAKEAWAY LABELS. ONCE YOU'RE IN THERE. THE END YOUR YEAR EMERGED INTO VISUAL BEYOND WORDS WITHIN THEIR IS CONVERSATIONS THEN THERE'S ENGAGEMENT. THEN THERE'S DISCUSSION ALL YOUR VETERAN. AND THE US THE IMAGE SPEAKS TO THE PERSON SO THEREFORE WITHOUT ANY PRECONCEIVED OR. SET UP WOOD LABELS. OUR IT ALLOW HOLDS VISUAL BEYOND WORDS ART ART ALLOWS A WELCOMING OF THE VISUAL SENSES. SO THAT'S WHAT I MEAN PARTY VOTE THE SENSES IT REFLECTS TRANQUILITY. HE CREATES A AND A SUBMARINE. EMBRACE SO THEREFORE WE'RE WITHOUT ANY AGAIN. CREE PERCEPTIONS AND SO FORTH YOU ARE THEN INVITED BY THE VISUALIZATION SO I NOTICE AND MANY OF OUR. ARMED VETERAN PROJECTS OR JUST THAT THERE VISUAL. VIGOR THEY'RE NOT ONLY HEALED THEY DIDN'T THEY NOT ONLY BRING OUT AND HEAL THE VETERAN. THE VETERAN ALSO EMBRACE THE CIVILIAN COMMUNITY BECAUSE. THE VETERAN IS OFFERING TO CIVILIAN COMMUNITY BEAUTY TRANQUILITY IN REFLECTION. THE INFLOW OF FOREIGN THAT GIVE. THE CIVILIAN THEN AS. WELL TELL ME ABOUT YOU HOW DID YOU COME ABOUT THIS AND THEN THERE FOR THE LISTENING AND THEN THEREFORE THERE'S A HEARING. AND SO I I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION AND THAT'S VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE I THINK TOO MANY. CIVILIAN AND. HAVE. NO MINIMAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHY. OF IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A VERY SMALL SUBSET MEANT OF ARE POPULATION THAT ACTUALLY SERVE RIGHT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EXAM AND HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES THAT. BUT BEYOND. PERHAPS THE EVEN THE ADULT THE. THE IMAGINATION PERHAPS THAT MAYBE I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT ANY DATE THEN DAY DON'T DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE GONE THROUGH THEY MAY FEEL THE CIVIL I WATCHED A MOVIE A PATH. YEAH THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE GOTTEN. AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT COMMUNICATION THAT SO THAT. LE SO THAT THE GENERAL SIDE CIVILIAN COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE VAST OF OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND OUR VETERANS EARNS BILL TO COMMUNICATE THAT. I THINK YOU ARE MAY BE THAT A MECHANISM TO DO THAT IN THE WAY THAT NAM. THAT IS I DO WITHOUT LABELS ABOUT NOBODY CONCEPTION SO. INSTILLED IN NC DEAD LEAVES. THE PATHWAY OF INVESTING IN THE COMMUNITIES. OVERALL WITHOUT POLARIZING WITHOUT THE DISCONNECT. LARGE BRINGS EVERYONE LOOKS AT LIKE THE LOOK AT VISUAL APPEALING ITEMS. OF PAINTINGS SCULPTURES THREE DIMENSIONAL WAR DANCE THEATER AND SO FORTH I THINK IF YOU COME NEAR WITHOUT WORDS. THINKING I THINK EVEN MUSIC AND WRITTEN EXPRESSION AS WELL. I JUST PIGGYBACK OFF THAT FOR MY MY NUMBER. THAT'S OR WAITING FOR WE WERE. WAITING FOR YOU. AND I THINK IT'S A PIGGYBACK OFF THAT IS LIKE THE IDEA OF LIKE THE WARM HAND OFTEN. I THINK TOO. USING THE ARTS LIKE YOU SAID THERE TOWARD THEIR TRANQUIL AND. THEY ALLOW A DIFFERENT VENUE USING. METAPHORS AND PUTTING THINGS INTO DIFFERENT FORMER COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO THE FAMILIES OF THE SERVICE MEMBERS CAN HEAR THE BAND THEN IT AND LEARN A DIFFERENT WAY I HAVE TO SAY. JUST THROUGH YOUR YOUR WORDS TODAY I MEAN I WAS HOLDING BACK TEARS I'VE HEARD THIS HOW MANY TIMES AND IT STILL GETS ME BUT. SOMETHING IN THE WAY THAT YOU DID THAT REALLY MADE IT EASIER NOT EASY FOR ME BUT EASIER TED SORRY. EASIER TO DIGEST. THAT VARY A SOMBER I EXPERIENCE AND SO I THINK JUST USING THE ARTS IN A WAY WE CAN PUT REALLY. HARDER LESS BENIGN. THINGS INTO CONTEXT IN A WAY THAT CAN BE DIGESTED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC. PEOPLE WHO MEAN WELL THEY THEY SUPPORT VETERAN THIRDS THEY JUST WANTED TO SAY. SO IT'S LIKE YOU ARE IS A CATALYST BECAUSE THEN IT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING YEAH YEAH GIVE THEM OF TALKING POINTS AND THEN THE PERSON THE CIVILIAN CAN. TALK TO THE VETERAN AND SEE THAT THAT VETERANS DISLIKE THEM ESSENTIALLY PUBLIC HEARING FARMER FROM INDIANA AND YOU KNOW WE CAN DOWN AGAIN AND. WE CAN DO THAT. THAT'S A. YEAH PLEASE HAVE. YOU ARE HERE EARLIER SIR WHEN ICE WHEN I READ MY PIECE. WHAT I'VE FOUND IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND I'VE BEEN DOING THIS AS LIKE PEOPLE ARE SECOND FACILITATE CONVERSATION?
