THE BILL WE CERTAINLY AGREE IT'S

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:40.438
TIME TO JOIN THE DOZENS OF

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:42.573
STATES WHICH PERMIT RON I DO

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.908
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OUR CONCERNS

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.176
ABOUT SOME ISSUES WHICH WE

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:46.444
STRONGLY BELIEVE SHOULD BE

00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:47.578
ADDRESSED AS THE BILL MOVES

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:50.248
FORWARD. SO ON A MACRO LEVEL OUR

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:51.849
CONCERNS RELATE TO INTERSTATE

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:53.584
RECOGNITION OF OUT OF STATE

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:55.853
NOTARIAL ACTS AND THE BREADTH OF

THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:00.591
CONTAINED IN THE BILL. STATE

THAT KNOWLEDGE TO OUT OF STATE

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:08.900
INCLUDING THOSE USING REMOTE

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:11.235
NOTARIZATION. ARE BEING RECORDED

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:13.170
IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES PURSUANT

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:15.640
TO. CIVIL CODE SECTION ELEVEN

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:17.308
EIGHTY NINE. IN THE CURRENT

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:19.043
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL APPEARS TO

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.379
TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THIS. LONG

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:23.414
STANDING PRINCIPLE OF ACCEPTING

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:26.183
NOTARIAL ACTS PERFORMED IN OTHER

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.585
STATES. THAT IT WILL MAKE

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:29.854
CALIFORNIA QUITE A DISTINCT OUT

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:31.589
LIAR IN THIS REGARD. WE'RE VERY

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.224
AFRAID THAT CONSUMERS AND

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:35.059
BUSINESSES WILL NOT BE SERVED BY

00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:36.561
A POTENTIAL SUBSEQUENT

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:38.796
LITIGATION CHALLENGING THE

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.965
VALIDITY OF DOCUMENTS EXECUTED

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.934
OUT OF STATE. IN SOME CASES

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.268
THOSE DOCUMENTS MAY NOT BE

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:47.171
OPERATIVE UNTIL YEARS AFTER THEY

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.506
ARE EXECUTED. WE RECOGNIZE

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:49.807
CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST IN

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:51.943
CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT WE

00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:53.077
REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:55.813
SHOULD BE RESOLVED AS THE BILL

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.648
PROCEEDS. AND ON THE PRIVATE

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.650
RIGHT OF ACTION THAT OTHERS HAVE

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:00.518
MENTIONED. WE THINK THE LANGUAGE

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:02.219
SHOULD BE MORE NARROWLY CRAFTED

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.788
ON ISSUES SUCH AS WHO HAS

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:07.091
STANDING TO SUE AND RELATING

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:09.193
DAMAGES TO HARM. THERE ARE MORE

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.762
TECHNICAL- TARGETED ISSUES SUCH

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:14.365
AS NOTARY EDUCATION FUNDING AND

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:15.866
NO TO RETURN HOLES WHICH WE

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:17.568

MISTER JOHN SORRY WANTED THANK

00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:20.965
YOU FOR TAKING THIS ON THE

00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:23.334
SUSPEND A SEVERAL YEAR JOURNEY

00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:23.934
THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:26.470
WORKING ON. AND I THINK IT IS

00:38:26.537 --> 00:38:28.139
DEFINITELY TIME THAT CALIFORNIA

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:30.274
TAKE ON THE REMOTE ONLINE

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:32.677
NOTARIZATION. BUT THIS IS

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:33.878
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO

00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:35.579
CAREFULLY I KNOW A NUMBER OF

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.381
OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IT BUT

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:39.483
CALIFORNIA HAS LONG HAD. A

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.619
DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR NOTORIOUS

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.320
SERVICES AND APPROPRIATELY

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.022
DIFFERENT SANDERS IT IS A LITTLE

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:46.891
BIT MORE PROTECTIVE OF CONSUMERS

00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:49.293
AND THAT HAS SURVIVED SCRUTINY

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.561
IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE SOME

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:52.663
TIME IT WE ARE JUST INTENDING

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.532
WITH THIS BILL TO CONTINUE THAT

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:56.434
HIGH LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.969
CONSUMERS OF SOME OF THE

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:00.871
CONCERNS RAISED. I CANNOT REALLY

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:02.873
AGREE WITH AND I WANT TO MAKE

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.642
SURE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:07.244
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN READ

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:07.878
THIS IN THE ANALYSIS AS WELL.

00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:09.680
THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING A STEP

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:10.948
BACKWARD IN IN FACT REALIGNING

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:12.249
OURSELVES WITH WHAT OTHER STATES

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:14.085
HAVE DONE AT A LOWER LEVEL OF

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:16.287
PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS THAT'S

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:17.154
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:20.257
ARE. PROBABLY SOME TECHNICAL

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:20.925
ISSUES THAT THAT CAN BE RESOLVED

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:23.060
OVER TIME. AS THIS WORKS THROUGH

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:25.563
ITS PROCESS. AND SOME PRACTICAL

00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:28.099
IMPLICATIONS OF COMMUNICATIONS

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:30.034
AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:33.504
HAVE. THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:35.873
APPROPRIATE OUT OF STATE.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.242
NOTARIZATION AND MANAGE THE

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.778
DOCUMENTS FROM THAT SO THAT I

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:41.946
THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS TO

00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:43.948
WORK ON BUT I'M- FOR ME I'M

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:46.417
HAPPY WITH THE STATE OF THE BILL

00:39:46.484 --> 00:39:47.885
RIGHT NOW. I THINK IT IS WORTHY

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:49.854
OF. MOVING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.988
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE DO

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.890
AND IF WE DON'T THEN IT AT.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:54.391
THAT'S POTENTIALLY ANOTHER SET

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:56.260
BACK AND THAT IN GETTING

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:59.997
CALIFORNIA TODAY TO SET A BETTER

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:02.366
STANDARD FOR REMOTE ONLINE

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:03.367
NOTARIZATION AN AWFULLY OTHER

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:05.202
STATES WILL. SHIFT AND FOLLOW

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:06.337
OUR LEAD I THINK MORE

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:09.140
APPROPRIATELY. GIVEN WHAT WE DO

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:11.041
SO I THINK YOU YOU HAVE DONE

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:11.842
YEOMAN'S WORK ON THIS MISTER

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:14.145
JONES SAWYER. AND WITH YOUR

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:15.813
PERSONAL STORIES WELL.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.015
ILLUSTRATES THE NEED AND NOT

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:19.583
JUST DURING A PANDEMIC BUT

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.318
OVERALL PEOPLE ARE MOVING ONLINE

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:22.987
AND HAVE EXPECTATIONS FOR VERY

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:25.122
SERVICES ONLINE. SO I THINK

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:27.158
THAT'S- APPROPRIATE THE WAY TO

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:29.894
GO AND MISTER MEG ATHENS.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.662
ANALYSIS REALLY POINTS TO THE

00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:32.763
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:33.998
BOTH BY SUPPORTERS AND BY

00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:35.833
OPPOSITIONS AND SOME OF THE

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.835
AREAS THAT THAT WE MAY NEED TO

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.570
CONTINUE TO WORK ON BUT I THINK

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:41.372
THIS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:43.474
THOUGH. AND I'M HAPPY THAT IT IS

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.242
MOVING ON TO HAVE THOSE

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:46.844
DISCUSSIONS AND I'M HOPING WE

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:48.746
CAN MOVE THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:51.382
AND THEN OFF TO THE SENATE. SO

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:52.249
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:54.451
DISCOGRAPHY. THANK YOU MR

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:56.687
CHAIRMAN- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:58.422
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:00.925
THINK IT'S VERY MUCH NEEDED-

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:02.927
IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE'VE HAVE

00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:06.063
REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY- HAVE TO

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.698
LONG IN THE IN THE MAKING I'M

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:10.768
SURE- AS SO I APPRECIATE HIS HIS

00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:13.170
HARD WORK ON THIS- WHAT I'M

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:15.372
CONCERNED ABOUT. IS THAT THIS

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:17.474
ACTUALLY MAY WITH THE CURRENT

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:18.275
LANGUAGE WITHOUT DOING SOME

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:20.077
TWEAKS. COULD ACTUALLY

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.046
DISCOURAGE THE USE OF THIS

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:25.616
TECHNOLOGY- AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:28.986
USE REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY. AND

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:31.255
HERE'S WHAT I'M YEAH MR BELOW I

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.090
THINK PRETTY APTLY OINTED OUT

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:35.326
SOME OF THOSE THINGS ONE IS. WE

00:41:35.392 --> 00:41:37.895
ARE KIND OF STAND IN THE FACE OF

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:38.796
FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:40.264
THAT ALLOWS. YOU KNOW THINGS

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.832
THAT WERE DONE IN OTHER STATES

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:44.335
TO BE RECOGNIZED- IN CALIFORNIA

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:46.871
AND IN FACT WE ALREADY DO THIS-

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:48.873
WHEN PEOPLE WHEN PEOPLE.

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:50.941
NOTARIZE DOCUMENTS OUT OF STATE.

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.376
WE ACCEPT THOSE IN CALIFORNIA

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:54.345
HAS BEEN A VALID NOTARIZATION OF

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:58.749
SAID DEED. FOR INSTANCE- SO I

00:41:58.816 --> 00:42:00.584
DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULD NOT DO

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.353
THAT IN THIS CASE WHEN SOMEBODY

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:05.522
DOES USES REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY.

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:08.859
TECHNOLOGY OUT OF STATE- TO ALSO

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:12.630
FULLY ACCEPT THAT IN CALIFORNIA-

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:13.964
THE OTHER PROBLEM IS. THE

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.532
OPENING OF THIS BROUGHT PRIVATE

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:18.135
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION- THAT

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:19.503
WILL MAYBE DISCOURAGE PEOPLE

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.906
FROM UTILIZING THIS IF THEY KNOW

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:24.541
THE A ONE. ONE MISTAKE ONE- YOU

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.277
KNOW NOT FOLLOWING ONE IOTA OF

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:28.279
THE OF THE LAW SUBJECTS YOU TO

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:32.416
BROAD. LITIGATION AND LIABILITY-

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:33.517
WE MAY HAVE A LOT ACTORS WHO

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:35.586
WON'T DECIDE TO DO REMOTE ONLINE

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:38.789
NOTARY SERVICES- IN CALIFORNIA

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:40.524
SO I THINK BOTH OF THOSE THINGS

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:41.892
COULD BE AN IMPEDIMENT. AND

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:42.993
THAT'S OF CONCERN THERE COULD BE

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.895
IMPEDIMENT TO US UTILIZING WHAT

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:46.497
I THINK WE ALL AGREE IS WHAT WE-

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:47.898
WILL MORE OF THIS MORE

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.300
AVAILABILITY OF THIS- IN

00:42:49.366 --> 00:42:52.703
CALIFORNIA. AND THEN LASTLY. I

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:53.570
THINK IT COULD ACTUALLY BE A

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:54.772
REALLY BIG IMPEDIMENT TO

00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:56.907
CONSUMERS AND I'LL I'LL GIVE AN

00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:58.342
EXAMPLE OF HOW I THINK THIS

00:42:58.409 --> 00:43:00.644
COULD. HURT CONSUMERS- YOU I

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:02.947
HAVE AN OUT OF STATE LANDOWNERS

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:05.316
. IN CALIFORNIA WHO NOTARIZE IS

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:08.085
A DEED SELLING IT TO A CONSUMER

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:10.254
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHO WHO WHO

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:13.457
BUYS THAT PROPERTY- AND THAT IS

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:16.327
DONE OUT OF STATE AND- BY REMOTE

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:18.996
ONLINE NOTARY AND YEARS LATER

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:21.098
SOMEONE COULD COME BACK AND SAY

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:22.366
TO THAT CONSUMER HEY THAT WASN'T

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.934
DONE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:26.003
PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA LAW

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.705
THAT'S THAT'S VOID. THAT DATE IS

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:30.708
NO GOOD THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM FOR

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:31.842
CONSUMERS IF THEY CAN'T HAVE

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:33.811
TRUST IN THE FACT THAT WHEN

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:35.312
SOMETHING IS SOLD TO THEM AND

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:37.081
THEY UTILIZE YOU KNOW REMOTE

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:39.049
ONLINE NOTARY THAT THAT'S NOT

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:41.719
GOING TO BE A VALID- RECORDING

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:45.723
AND GIVE THEM TITLE TO PROPERTY-

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:48.092
SO THAT IS A REALLY BIG PROBLEM

00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:49.660
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT AND

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:52.062
I THINK IT'S IT REALLY ISN'T A

00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:52.930
BIG CHANGE THIS IS RECOGNIZING

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:54.198
THAT WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW.

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:55.566
REMOTE ONLINE NOTARY THIS DONE

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:57.935
OTHER STATES TO BERECOGNIZED IN

00:43:58.002 --> 00:44:01.138
CALIFORNIA AS WELL- AND IT'S NOT

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:02.706
LIKE THE STATE'S A REALLY LACKS

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:04.742
PROTECTIONS. I REALLY DON'T

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.043
EVERY SAY THIS DONE THIS HAS

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:07.544
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO ENSURE

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:09.346
THAT. THE PEOPLE HAT ARE DOING

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:11.348
THIS ARE WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE.

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:12.983
FACT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:13.717
HAVING A NOTARY IN THE FIRST

00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:15.919
PLACE IS THAT YOU APPEAR. YOU

00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:17.788
CAN BE FOR THE PAIR BEFORE THE

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:18.555
NOTARY PHYSICALLY. OR YOU CAN DO

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:21.058
IT IN THE DIGITAL WORLD. ONLINE

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:23.360
AND THEY ENSURE THAT YOU ARE IN

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:24.962
FACT TO YOU SAY YOU ARE IN THIS

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:27.197
IS YOUR SIGNATURE. AND AUTHENTIC

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:29.299
TO AUTHENTICATE THE DOCUMENT- SO

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:31.235
I DON'T THINK THERE REALLY IS

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:33.203
ANY CONCERN ABOUT OTHER STATES.

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.872
YOU KNOW SOMEHOW ALLOWING FOR

00:44:34.938 --> 00:44:36.140
FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS TO BE

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:37.708
RECORDED THEY HAVE PROTECTIONS

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:41.378
AS WELL- IN PLACE SO. I WOULD

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:42.713
REALLY HELP ME MAKE THAT CHANGE

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.082
WE GO FOR A REALLY I WANT TO. BE

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:46.116
SUPPORTER OF BRINGING THIS

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.985
ONLINE BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT.

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:48.886
YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR WOULD

00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:50.621
ENTERTAIN MAKING THOSE THOSE

00:44:50.687 --> 00:44:52.423
CHANGES TO JUST MAKE SURE THIS

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:53.557
IS GONNA BE IS BROADLY

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:55.993
AVAILABLE. AS POSSIBLE TO

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.629
CONSUMERS WHICH IS WHAT I THINK-

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:06.270
WE ALL WANT. THREE THANK YOU

00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:08.705
GERMAN BUT I DID WANT TO SAY.

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:10.407
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:11.809
WAS DONE ON THIS- I THINK

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.444
EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES THIS IS

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.212
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:17.047
ADDRESS. AND THIS IS A LOT OF

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:19.349
HARD WORK AND EVEN SPEAKING WITH

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:21.452
AND HEARING THE OPPOSITION TODAY

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:22.653
IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE ON THAT

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:24.521
PATH THAT THIS WASN'T SOMETHING

00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:26.423
THAT WAS DONE BY ONE GROUP AND

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.525
THAT'S THE END OF IT THIS WAS

00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:30.461
ABSOLUTE COLLABORATION AND I'M

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:32.196
REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:34.731
WAS DONE IN THAT REGARD- I THINK

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.500
THAT. AS A CHAIR HAS MENTIONED

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.469
THE PROTECTION OF THE CONSUMER

00:45:38.535 --> 00:45:40.571
IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST

00:45:40.637 --> 00:45:41.872
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK TO

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:43.040
US TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:44.908
POLICY WE DO PASS PROTECTS THE

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:47.744
CONSUMER. AND IT'S MUCH EASIER

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:48.946
FOR NO REASON THAN TO FOLLOW

00:45:49.012 --> 00:45:50.781
WHATEVER THE POLICY IS BUT OUR

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:52.716
CONSUMERS RELY ON US TO PROVIDE

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:54.885
THAT PROTECTION BUT JUST IN

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:58.088
REVIEWING THE VERY EXTENSIVE-

00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:01.892
ANALYSIS AND IN SPEAKING WITH-

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:04.461
THOSE IN SUPPORT IN THOSE WITH

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:05.696
CONCERNS IT'S CLEAR THAT A LOT

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:07.731
OF WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS AND-

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:09.766
THIS IS WHAT THIS IS THE WAY

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:11.468
POLICY SHOULD BE DONE. SO THANK

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:05.148

THAT I'VE I'VE HAD THIS

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:32.068
EXPERIENCE I SERVED TEN YEARS ON

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:33.503
MY H. AWAY AND SERVED AS

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:35.505
PRESIDENT AND I THINK THAT IS

00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:36.806
ONE OF MY CONCERNS LAST YEAR

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:38.808
RAND AB FIVE A TO. ME ONLY TO BE

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:40.710
ABLE TO. MAKE I EASIER TO

00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:41.878
RECOLLECT BOARD MEMBERS BECAUSE

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.446
THERE IS NO BOARD MEMBERS AND I

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:45.081
TEND TO JOKES SOMETIMES AS I HAD

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:46.816
A RUN FOR SOMETHING TO GET OFF

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.918
MY BOARD. AND- AND SO THAT'S

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:50.320
WHERE I'M HERE ABOUT THEM THAT

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:51.888
IS A CONCERN ESPECIALLY WITH-

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:53.389
INFLATION IN THE PRICES OF-

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:56.192
HOUSING GOING UP IS THAT- IF

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:57.593
THERE'S A COST I DON'T KNOW IF

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.829
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T COST MAIN BIT

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:01.864
MINIMUM BUT- IF IT GOES BACK TO

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:03.666
THE- H. AWAY. MANAGEMENT TEAM

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:04.901
EVENTUALLY IT'S GOING TO GO BACK

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:07.036
WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR CONTRACT

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:07.770
THE NEXT YEAR AND IS GOING TO

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:10.073
COME BACK TO THEM AND I KNOW

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:11.841
THAT WE'VE- I WAS GIVEN

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:12.475
DIFFERENT TRAINING OPTIONS AND

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:13.810
OVER THE YEARS I'VE ALWAYS ASKED

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.778
HAS ANYONE EVER PICK THEM UP AND

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:16.679
THEY HAVEN'T. SO THE I THINK

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.548
THAT'S MY CONCERN IS- THAT IS

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:21.117
GOING TO- EVEN PUSH BACK MORE

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:22.618
AND TRYING TO GET GOOD QUALIFIED

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:24.721
PEOPLE TO COME AS ALSO TAKING

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:25.955
USUALLY IF YOU'RE DOING AN

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:26.756
ETHICS CLASS THAT COULD BE A

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.624
THREE HOUR ETHICS CLASS AND THAT

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.793
MAY NOT SOUND LIKE A LOT. BUT

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.128
WHEN PEOPLE ARE BUSY IT COULD BE

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:34.464
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT JUST TO

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.264
TEAR THEM SO. AT THIS TIME GOING

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.899
TO VOTE NO BUT IF THERE'S THINGS

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:40.636
YOU CAN WORK OUT- THAT WOULD BE

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:42.372
GREAT. DEFTLY OFFICE. ON THE TOP

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.440
OF HER. LIKE CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:46.242
FOR. AND ALSO. WE'RE BE THERE

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.809
THE BEGINNING BUT THIS. THE

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:49.145
BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS SO I'M

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:50.780
OPEN TO THAT. BUT JUST ONE THING

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:51.948
I WANTED. TO REITERATE TO YOU

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.017
TALK ABOUT THE INCREASED COST IF

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.518
WE WERE TO- MAKE THIS ADDITIONAL

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:57.387
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. BUT I

01:00:57.453 --> 01:01:00.123
LOOK AT IT IS. YEAH MAYBE. IT

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.591
MAY BE A SMALL INVESTMENT

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:03.059
BECAUSE SAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:05.361
THIS TRAINING. EDUCATION

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.329
REGARDING. ETHICS AND

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:08.564
HARASSMENT. AT THAT AGE WHITE

01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:09.832
FACE TO THE LAWSUIT. THEY'RE

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:11.734
GOING TO PAY. A LOT OF MONEY

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:12.869
OUT. THIS LOOK TO PREVENT THAT

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:14.837
RIGHT SO. WHO'S TO SAY THAT OKAY

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:16.906
THIS YEAR. WE HAVE TWO OR THREE

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:18.741
LAWSUITS BECAUSE- FOLKS WERE

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.343
HARASSED. OR INTIMIDATED OR

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.011
WHATEVER WANT TO CALL IT. BUT

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.146
MAYBE COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:24.680
IF THAT TRAINING SO WHO'S TO SAY

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.482
THAT. BECAUSE THE LOSS IS NOT

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:27.784
WORKING WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:28.751
GOING TO RAISE IT. NEXT YEAR

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.820
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:31.954
TO COVER THIS ADDITIONAL COST

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.790
SO. I LOOK AT THIS BILL AS A

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.258
PREVENTATIVE MEASURE. TO HELP

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.592
PROTECT THE HOMEOWNERS.

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.294
ASSOCIATION FROM ANY FUTURE

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.796
LAWSUITS BECAUSE TECHNICALLY.

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:41.564
WHY NOT OUR BOARD MEMBERS WERE

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:46.102
EDUCATED AND TRAINED IN THIS SO-

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.403
THEY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF NOT

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:48.604
. THE HAVING THESE ISSUES HAPPEN

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:51.908
OUR TO. SO JUST CONFIRM FOR. I

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:54.377
THINK IT'S- THANK YOU FOR THE

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:56.712
QUESTION. COMMENTS IT WAS

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:57.513
RODRIGUEZ OR THANK YOU FOR

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.648
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:00.650
THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:02.285
APPROPRIATE I'VE INTERACTED WITH

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:03.920
A NUMBER OF HOAS THROUGHOUT BY

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:06.189
MY LIFE IT AND OFTEN TIMES

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:07.090
THEY'RE VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:08.991
IT IS A LOT- OFTEN THE SAME

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.760
PEOPLE AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:13.296
ISSUE ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY IN.

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:15.798
IN RECRUITING BUT- OFTENTIMES

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.366
THE SAME PEOPLE WITH WITHOUT THE

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:19.202
SOPHISTICATION OF DEALING WITH.

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:22.071
LOTS OF MONEY. AND NOT VERY

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.206
CLEAR ON THEIR ETHICAL

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.974
OBLIGATIONS AND THESE ARE

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:27.910
PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS. BUT IN A

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:30.680
WAY THEY THEY OPERATE. I THINK

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:32.915
AS WE WOULD EXPECT A PUBLIC.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.484
BODY TO OPERATE BECAUSE THE

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.619
PEOPLE LIVING AND PAYING DUES

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:38.688
AND THEN AND BEING SUBJECTED TO

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:40.056
THAT THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.658
. OR MORE LIKE THE PUBLIC

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:44.961
ESPECIALLY IN LARGE COMPLEXES

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:47.130
WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO MANAGE

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.731
SO FOR NOT WILLING TO SET AN

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:51.300
APPROPRIATE STANDARD THEN THERE

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.768
IS A LOT OF MISCHIEF THAT CAN

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:54.737
HAPPEN AND IT IS IN THE BEST

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:56.139
INTEREST OF THE HOMEOWNERS

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:58.641
ASSOCIATION AND EVERYONE WHO IS

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.910
PARTICIPATING IN IT TAT THE-

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:02.278
THE THOSE OFFICERS ARE TRAINED

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.113
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THICAL

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.948
OBLIGATIONS AND I DO AGREE WITH

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:07.750
YOU THAT IT WILL SAVE A LOT OF

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:10.453
GRIEF AND MONEY. DOWN THE LINE

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.822
TO GO AHEAD WITH THAT STEP SO I

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:14.624
THINK IT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:15.791
BILL. RIGHT AND WITH THAT YOU

THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE YOU TODAY
