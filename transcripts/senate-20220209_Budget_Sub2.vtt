HAVE BEEN A OPPORTUNITY DO IT IS

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:16.214
THREE WATER CLIMB AT IN A WAY

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:18.250
THAT IS VERY RE I KNOW FOR MANY

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:19.451
SIR THIS PASS YEAR AS WE HAD TO

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:21.086
RISK TO A CAN THROUGH THE STATE

00:25:21.152 --> 00:25:24.289
AND MANY COMMUNITIES- LAST LEVEL

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:27.993
- I KNOW YOU THESE YEAR WHERE I

00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:29.661
THINK WE HAVE TO BE MIND THAT WE

00:25:29.728 --> 00:25:31.196
MOST RECENTLY JUST WENT THROUGH-

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:33.698
AN INCREDIBLE PROUD OF RECORD-

00:25:33.765 --> 00:25:35.700
THE HEIGHT OF WHICH WITHIN

00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:36.234
TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:37.402
FIFTEEN SO VERY RECENTLY- AND

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:38.803
WHAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY IS THE

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.839
BENEFIT OF A LOT OF- CONTINUE ON

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.641
THE PATH FOR. FROM THAT TIME-

00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:44.042
I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:45.377
ACTUALLY THE STATE WATER BOARD

00:25:45.443 --> 00:25:47.412
SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN HAS BEEN

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:48.580
ABLE TO INVEST NEARLY TEN

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:50.715
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE-

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:52.550
THAT IMPACT INCLUDES LOANS AND

00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:55.220
GRANTS FROM THE MAJOR STATE

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:57.656
REVOLVING LOAN- PROJECTS- THE

00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.724
CLEAN WATER SRF AND THE DRINKING

00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:01.927
WATER SRF BUT ALSO PROP ONE BOND

00:26:01.993 --> 00:26:03.728
DOLLARS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

00:26:03.795 --> 00:26:05.430
DOLLARS THERE- THAT ARE

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:07.399
CRITICALLY GOING INTO AND

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:09.434
CREATING A RESILIENCY TO DROUGHT

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.403
NOW AS WE'VE JUST WENT AGAIN

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:14.439
THROUGH THIS LAST YEAR- SO- I

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:15.607
THINK THAT WHAT YOU KNOW I'D

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:17.342
LIKE TO MAKE SURE AND MAKE NOTE

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:19.044

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:31.790
BE MAKING IN OUR SYSTEMS AND

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:33.858
INSTEAD IT'S REALLY BAD AS

HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS A YEAR

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:13.871
THIS IMMEDIATE MITIGATION MONEY

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:16.373
LETS US MANAGE THAT DYNAMIC

BETTER. SECOND MANDATORY IMPROVE

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.445
RESILIENCY OF THE SEVENTY FIVE

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:22.613
MILLION ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION

00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:24.314
WOULD GO TO IMPROVING OUR OWN

00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:27.050
STATE LANDS. A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:28.352
SOMETHING WE'VE JUST DONE.

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.754
FORECAST WHAT WE WOULD DO IS

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:32.322
THAT ARE ASKED WILDLIFE AREA UP

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:33.991
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WORKING

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:35.859
WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFALL. WE

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:37.528
WENT OUT TO REPLACE FAILING

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:40.364
WATER CONTROL STRUCTURES. ARE

CERTAIN WETLAND UNITS ALL FOR

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.239
THE BENEFIT A WATERFALL IN WATER

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:50.974
USE EFFICIENCY ON OUR LAND LINE.

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:55.479
ANOTHER WAY. WE DO THIS WORK IS

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:56.146
ON PRIVATE LANDS. JUST THIS PAST

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:57.614
YEAR WHICH WE REPORT ON IN WHICH

00:46:57.681 --> 00:46:59.683
FORECAST WHAT WILL DO IN THE

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.685
DAYS AHEAD. WHEN WE ENTERED INTO

CENTRAL VALLEY. OF BIRD RETURNS

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:09.326
WHERE WE COMPENSATE FARMERS TO

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:11.128
FLOOD THEIR FIELDS IN WILDLIFE

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:13.297
FRIENDLY WAYS THE SUPPORT SURE

00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:16.667
BOARDS AND WATERFALLS AND LISTS

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:18.335
OF REQUIREMENTS. LET AREA THE

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:20.003
SQUARE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.906
HATCHERIES AND FISH PRODUCTION.

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:24.274
LAST YEAR WE PICKED UP AND MOVED

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.243
OFF ALMOST SEVENTEEN MILLION

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.844
SALMON FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:47:27.911 --> 00:47:29.880
HATCHERIES DOWN INTO THE COASTAL

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:31.648
ESTUARIES SO THAT WE WOULD

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:33.150
IMPROVE THEIR SURVIVAL CHANCE.

00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:35.419
WE NEED TO DO THAT SAME THING

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:37.454
AGAIN THIS COMING YEAR. AND WHAT

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.356
WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO DO WHICH

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:41.525
FORECAST WHAT WE WOULD DO IS

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:44.628
BEGIN TO MODERNIZE ALL OF OUR

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:45.762

00:47:54.338 --> 00:47:55.772
GETTING MODERN HIGH CAPACITY

00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:58.575
TRIPLOID EXHORTING MACHINES. ALL

00:47:58.642 --> 00:47:59.876
OF WHICH ARE ONE TIME

00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:01.845
INVESTMENTS THAT ALSO FIX OUR S.

00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:04.948
B. B. CHALLENGES ON OUR GAP. SO

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:06.450
THOSE ARE THE THREE REASONS I

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:08.085
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SEVENTY FIVE

IMPACTS THAT WERE SEEN FROM. THE

00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:44.715
LOSS OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:47.150
DUE TO- REDUCED GROUNDWATER

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.785
SUPPLY AS WE DEAL WITH THE

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:52.389
ONGOING DROUGHT AND SEGMENTATION

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:54.057
. THIS IS- LET'S NOT ONLY

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.425
AFFECTS THE AGRICULTURAL

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:56.626
INDUSTRY BUT ALSO THOSE

00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:58.228
COMMUNITIES WHERE AGRICULTURE

00:49:58.295 --> 00:50:00.263
REALLY IS THAT. A SIGNIFICANT

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.366
SOURCE OF JOBS AND ECONOMIC

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:04.434

MILLION TO A MILLION ACRES OF

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:14.544
LAND WILL BE FOLLOWED DUE TO

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:15.746
REDUCED GROUNDWATER

00:50:15.812 --> 00:50:18.181
AVAILABILITY. SO THIS IS A

00:50:18.248 --> 00:50:20.617
CRITICAL TOOL TO HELP REGION'S

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:23.019
BRING THEIR GROUNDWATER BASINS

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:25.422
INTO A SUSTAINABLE BALANCE- THE

00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:26.990
EMPHASIS WILL BE ON PROJECTS

BY- BY THOSE REGIONS- AND I

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.099
REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:37.834
THIS IS ABOUT EMPOWERING REGIONS

00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:39.302
TO REALLY. DETERMINE WHAT THEIR

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:40.771
FUTURE IS AND TO DEVELOP THOSE

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:43.039
STRATEGIES SO THE FUNDING WILL

00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:45.075
PROVIDE FUNDS TO REGIONAL

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:47.944
ENTITIES. THAT WELL CONVENE

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:50.380
VOLUNTARY LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS WHO

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:52.682
WILL BE TASKED VAN WITH A

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:54.618
DEVELOPING THEIR STRATEGIES THAT

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:56.953
IDENTIFIES THE REDUCE OPTIONS

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.488
FOR THESE LANDS THAT MAKE UP

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:01.458
SHALLOW- AND THAT CAN NO LONGER

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:04.194
BE IRRIGATED- SO THE PROJECTS

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:05.862
THAT WE- WE THINK WILL BE

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:07.497
RESULTING FROM THE STRATEGIES

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.399
WILL DRIVE TOWARD OUTCOMES THAT

00:51:09.466 --> 00:51:12.202
IMPROVES. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT-

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:14.237
THE ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES AND AS

WHO WILL FACE THE MOST IMPACT

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:31.922
FROM THESE LANDS GOING SHALLOW

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:34.324
AND THEN BEING REPURPOSED. FIVE

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:35.792
SO WE ARE OUT TO ADVANCE THIS

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:37.360
WORK WE ARE CONVENE AN

00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:38.895
INTERAGENCY GROUP WE HAVE

NICE TO SEE YOU ALL- YEAH WE

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.884
THINK IT IS HELPFUL TO THINK

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.320
AOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:24.887
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.723
DOLLAR PACKAGE AND KIND OF TWO.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.225

AN IMMEDIATE PRESSING CONCERNS

01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:35.331
AND THEN THOSE PROPOSALS THAT

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:37.066
ARE MORE FOCUSED ON LONGER TERM

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.801
KIND OF RESILIENCE FOR FUTURE

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:40.603
DROUGHTS SO IN THAT FIRST

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.639
CATEGORY IT'S REALLY TOO EARLY

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:45.675
TO TELL EVEN JUST A MONTH AGO

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:46.309
WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:48.878
RELEASED. THINGS SEEMED A LOT

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.814
BETTER THAN THEY SEEM TODAY- SO

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.616
YOU KNOW WE'LL KNOW MORE ABOUT

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.451
AS THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BECAUSE

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:56.552
THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING USUALLY

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:59.155
FALLS SO BY THE MAY REVISION I

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.023
THINK. I WILL HAVE A BETTER

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.290
PERSPECTIVE ON HOW MUCH OF THAT

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:03.026
MEDIA AT WHETHER IT'S THE TWO

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.060
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.529
CONTINGENCY FIND OR THAT KIND OF

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.197
ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE MILLION THAT

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:09.632
WE WOULD CONSIDER MORE

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.834
IMMEDIATE. DROUGHT RESPONSE

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:14.570
ACTIVITIES IN THIS PACKAGE SO-

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.506
WE RECOMMEND KIND OF WAITING AND

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:19.275
SEEING ON ON THAT MANY BUT BEING

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.076
PREPARED THAT WE MAY NEED TO

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:22.712
HAVE. ATTENTION LEE SOME OF THAT

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:24.147
MONEY POTENTIALLY MORE THAN THAT

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:26.015
MANY- DEPENDING ON HOW THE

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:28.251
HYDROLOGY DEVELOPS IN THE NEXT

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:30.553
FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS. IN TERMS

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.488
OF THE LONGER TERM RESILIENCE

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:33.856
THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:36.392
THE BULK OF THIS PACKAGE TO BE

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.960
NOT FOCUSED ON IMMEDIATE.

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:39.962
RESPONSE BUT REALLY RESILIENCE

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.364
ON THE LONGER TERM BUT THAT

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:42.665
DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S A BAD THING

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:45.001
THAT CERTAINLY HAS MERIT AND AS

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:46.035
HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BY YOUR

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.604
SPEAKERS ALREADY THE BEST TIME

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:49.906
TO PREPARE FOR DROUGHT IS BEFORE

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:52.375
THE DAY COMES- BECAUSE IT THAT

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.710
THIS PROJECTS DO TAKE A LONG

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:56.679
TIME TO QUIT. A SIGN AND I. CAN

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.281
YOU CAN TAKE CAN TAKE MONTHS OR

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:02.085
YEARS. SO WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:04.754
IS A VALUE FOR THE STATE HOWEVER

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:06.355
WHEN YOU DID MAKE VERY

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:07.690
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THAT

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:10.259
THROUGH THE TWENTY. TWENTY ONE

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:11.561
TWENTY TWO BUDGET BOTH IN THE

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:18.434
CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS. THE AS

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:19.669
YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR THE

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:20.636
EIGHT IN THE MILLION. PRO IN THE

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:21.771
BUDGET BEFORE YOU. FOR THE

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.639
BUDGET YEAR SO NOT. IT EVEN IF

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:24.140
DIDN'T AND I ANY OF THE

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.541
GOVERNOR'S NEW. THE STATE STILL

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:27.844
BE ROOM SO. PROGRESS ON THAT

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.545
GOAL. SO I THINK OUR OUR MAIN

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:30.880
MESSAGE HE WAS NOT THAT THIS

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.582
ISN'T A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.217
STATE BUT I THINK YOU CAN

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:35.618
CONSIDER WHETHER THIS IS THE

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.787
HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR YOUR

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.355
GENERAL FUND. THIS YEAR. GIVEN

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.690
THOSE THAT EITHER SIGNIFICANT

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:42.125
INVESTMENTS AND ALL THE OTHER

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.025
PRIORITIES YOU HAVE IN THE

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:45.194
BUDGET. SO IT IS A HIGH

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:47.497
PRIORITY. AND CERTAINLY THE

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:48.698
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR YOU IS

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:49.832
NOT THE ONLY APPROACH YOU CAN

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.701
TAKE- YOU COULD CONSIDER

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:53.336
MODIFICATIONS THAT REALLY

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.871
ADDRESSED WENT. WHAT YOU AS A

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.005
LEGISLATURE THINK ARE THE

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:58.207
HIGHEST STATE PRIORITIES. SO FOR

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.643
EXAMPLE- YOU COULD CONSIDER IT

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.378
MORE MANY FOR GROUNDWATER

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.846
RECHARGE SINCE THOSE ARE

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:05.915
ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY. SHOW A

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:07.783
LOT OF PROMISE FOR WATER SUPPLY

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:09.585
AS WELL AS OTHER BENEFITS LIKE

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.387
FLOOD CONTROL SO. IT'S A PRETTY

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:12.455
WE WOULD WE WOULD CHARACTERIZE

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.257
AS A PRETTY MODEST COMPONENT OF

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:16.192
THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL ONLY

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:17.326
THIRTY MILLION SO YOU COULD

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.095
CONSIDER A GREATER INVESTMENT IN

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.863
THAT AREA. THERE WASN'T THAT

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.265
MUCH MONEY IN THAT KIND OF

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:25.001
CATEGORY FOR. THE RECENT PACKAGE

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.537
THAT PASSED. SIMILARLY WE THINK

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.639
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER A-

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.174
PERHAPS A SMALLER INVESTMENT IN

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.242
WATER CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.210
COMPARED TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:36.145
HAS PROPOSED. JUSTGIVEN THAT IS

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:39.448
A RELATIVELY SMALL. SHARE OF

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:41.117
WATER USE ACROSS THE STATE BUT

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.019
ALSO BECAUSE THE STATE HAS PUT A

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:46.389
BIG. EMPHASIS IN THAT AREA

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:49.125
THROUGH POLICY CHANGES- AND

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:50.927
THROUGH ACTIVITIES DURING THE

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.295
LAST DROUGHT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:54.363
PROGRESS IN IN GREATER WATER

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.032
EFFICIENCIES IN THAT URBAN

01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:57.967
SETTING. SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO

01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:59.268
CONSIDER WHETHER THAT IS THE

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.103
HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR YOUR AB

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.672
INVESTMENTS THIS YEAR SHOULD YOU

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:05.107
CHOOSE TO MAKE THEM. AN AND AS

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.676
NOTED IN THE AGENDA WITH THE

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:07.710
DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION'S

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.445
LAND RECORD BESTING PROGRAM WE

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:10.880
THINK THAT HAS A LOT OF PROMISE

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:12.114
IT REALLY FOCUSES ON SOME REALLY

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.983
IMPORTANT GOALS AS THE DIRECTOR

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:15.918
DISCUSSED. BUT IT IS A BRAND NEW

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.119
PROGRAM WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:18.955
OUTCOMES YET. WE DON'T REALLY

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:20.456
KNOWHOW THE PROGRAM IS SHAPING

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:21.991
UP WITH THE DEMAND WILL BE YOU

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:24.293
HAVE AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.195
WHETHER IT NEEDS SOME. KIND OF

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:27.763
RESHAPING AS IT'S BEING

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.865
IMPLEMENTED. SO YOU KNOW YOU

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:31.133
COULD THINK ABOUT THAT AS A

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.835
PILOT EFFORT THIS YEAR AND WAIT

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:34.470
TO BEFORE MAKING FURTHER

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.605
INVESTMENTS TO WE GET SOME

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:41.978
OUTCOME DATA. SO THOSE ARE JUST. A FEW EXAMPLES OF WAYS THAT

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.512
YOU COULD TWEAK THIS PACKAGE TO

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:44.680
REFLECT PAY OR- AT ANOTHER. WE

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.015
WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:46.916
AND- IS. THINKING ABOUT THE

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:48.684
STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OR

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.152
THE GANN LIMIT AS YOU HAVE

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:51.287
DISCUSSED IN FULL COMMITTEE THAT

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:53.022
IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:56.192
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- SO AS YOU

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:57.760
THINK ABOUT IF YOU WERE GOING

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.028
TO. CHANGE WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:00.863
PROPOSAL IS THINKING ABOUT THAT

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.865
OVERALL CALCULATIONS OF WHICH

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.600
ACTIVITIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.102
LIMIT OR NOT SHE TYPICALLY

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.870
CAPITAL OUTLAY ACTIVITIES ARE

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:11.540
EXCLUDED SO- THAT. THAT MAY BE

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.709
HELPFUL AT FRAMEWORK AS YOU'RE

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:15.378
THINKING ABOUT THIS PACKAGE. AND

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:16.312
THEN THE FINAL POINT I WOULD

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:18.147
MAKE IS ONE THAT YOU MISTER

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:19.248
CHAIR HAVE ALREADY RAISED AS

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.683
HAVE SEVERAL THE SPEAKERS WHICH

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.485
IS GREAT WHICH IS OVERSIGHT.

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:24.553
THIS IS A LOT OF MANY AND THAT

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.822
THE LEGISLATURE AND STATE

01:05:26.889 --> 01:05:28.891
INVESTED IN WATER RESILIENCE.

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.393
AND TYPICALLY THOSE INVESTMENTS

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.895
HAVE BEEN THROUGH BONDS. AND

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:33.896
TYPICALLY WITH BOND LANGUAGE

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.331
THERE'S A LOT OF OVERSIGHT AND

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:36.832
ACCOUNTABILITY KIND OF BUILT IN

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:38.668
AND REPORTING LANGUAGE AND IN

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:40.102
EVEN ON NOT ONLY ON WHAT

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:42.071
PROJECTS ARE FUNDED BUT- ALSO ON

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:43.506
OUTCOMES HOW DOLLARS ARE FLOWING

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:45.274
OUT THE DOOR. THAT ISN'T

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:46.776
AUTOMATICALLY BUILT IN WITH THIS

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:49.078
PACKAGE THAT YOU ARE APPROVED IN

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:50.913

WHAT'S GREAT IS THAT THE

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:53.883
ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING THAT ON

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:55.017
ALREADY TO PROVIDE THAT

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:56.986
INFORMATION- WHERE WE'VE GOT A

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.688

JUST BECAUSE IT'S GOOD

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.095
GOVERNMENT AND OVERSIGHT OVER

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.763
PUBLIC DOLLARS BUT ALSO BECAUSE

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:08.230

ABOUT WHICH PROGRAMS ARE

01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:15.304
OVERSUBSCRIBED WHICH PROGRAMS

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:16.539
MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE GETTING MONEY

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:18.874
OUT THE DOOR- WHERE THERE MIGHT

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:20.843
BE BARRIERS OR OBSTACLES THAT

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:22.578
NEED. INTERVENTION FROM THE

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:14.156
30% OF WAS THE NUMBER THAT PUT

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:17.193
OUT SO MY- IS TO SHOULD WE BE

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.394
TRANSFERRING OR SHOULD WE

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:20.262
CONSIDER. PUTTING MORE MONEY

01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:22.231
INTO THE AGRICULTURE OR SHOULD

WE JUST. ARE ON CONSERVATION OR

SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT OTHER.

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.337
OTHER THAN CONSERVATION OTHER

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:30.473
RANDOM MORE MONEY AND SIGMAR

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:32.007
MORE MONEY AND AT THE A

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:33.909
DIFFERENT PROGRAM IS IT IS IT.

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:36.846
DISCUSS ADVERSE IS RESIDENTIAL

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.214
OR THE OR THE BALANCE MAYBE IT

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.114
SHOULD BE EIGHTY TWENTY THE

01:08:39.181 --> 01:08:41.584
OTHER WAY I I'M- INTERESTED IN

01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:45.321
YOUR THOUGHTS. YEAH I THINK I AM

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:46.522
WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:49.125
VIEW. KIND OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.493
PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED MILLION ON

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:52.161
WATER CONSERVATION AS MEANING

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:53.796
THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO SPEND TWO

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:54.330
HUNDRED MILLION ON WATER

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:56.398
CONSERVATION AND DECIDE HOW MUCH

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.367
IS ACT VERSUS- AND I THINK. YOU

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:00.336
YOU HAVE OPTIONS TO DECIDE WHAT

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:01.871
ARE YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:03.472
SOME OF THOSE MIGHT BE ON DEMAND

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:06.175
MANAGEMENT WHICH IS- WHAT KIND

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.510
OF WATER CONSERVATION IS

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.945
LOWERING DEMAND- AS SECRETARY

01:09:10.012 --> 01:09:11.447
ROSS MENTIONED THERE IS ALSO

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.115
ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:14.450
THAT WAS PART OF THAT EIGHT

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:15.451
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION FOR

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:17.820
THE AG SWEEP PROGRAM SO IT'S NOT

01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:19.788
JUST THAT THIS IS THE ONLY

01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:21.991
FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THAT- BUT

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.926
BUT YOU COULD ALSO THINK ABOUT

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.828
WATER SUPPLY. WHICH AGAIN RIGHT

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.296
AROUND WATER RECHARGE IS ONE OF

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.832
THE ACTIVITIES- AS WELL AS AS

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.901
OTHER WATER SUPPLY ACTIVITIES-

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.602
LIKE LIKE WATER RECYCLING FOR

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:37.506
EXAMPLE- SO REALLY IN GETTING TO

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:39.575
A MORE SUSTAINABLE WATER.

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:43.212
APPROACH STATEWIDE THEIR WATER

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.413
DEMAND MANAGEMENT AND

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.881
CONSERVATION IS ONE CATEGORY BUT

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.049
THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:48.584
ACTIVITIES SO I THINK WE WOULD

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:50.052
CONSIDER UNITS AT BREAK A

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:52.421
MANDATE YOU DON'T CONSIDER WATER

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.822
CONSERVATION KIND OF IN A VACUUM

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:56.392
BUT BUT THINK ABOUT YOUR LARGER

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:59.161
SUITE OF OPTIONS. OKAY OF THE

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:00.296
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THAT THE

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:01.463
GOVERNOR'S ADDITIONALITY THAT WE

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.866
HAVE WE THERE'S A CHUNK OF TWO

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.234
HUNDRED FIFTY THAT WERE CUT IT

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:07.403
SEE WHAT HAPPENS THIS SPRING HOW

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:11.106
MUCH RAIN WE HAVE. AND HOLD THE

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:13.475
FACT- I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO COME.

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.144
ON THE TIDAL WAVE OF FEDERAL

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.445
MONEY THAT'S COMING WE KNOW THAT

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:18.247
THERE'S THREE POINT EIGHT THAT'S

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:19.515
GUARANTEED THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:23.218
GET. AND HOW WE COULD. USE THE

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:26.088
CURRENT BUDGET REQUESTS. WITH

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:27.022
THE ANTICIPATION OF WHERE THE

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:28.490
MONEY'S GOING TO GO. BUT AS OUR

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.659
ALLUDED TO. SIX POINT SEVEN

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:33.429
BILLION OUT OF EPA FIVE POINT

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:34.296
FIVE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:35.598
HOMELAND SECURITY FEMALE THREE

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.199
POINT FIVE THAT IS FLOOD COULD.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.734
FLOOD ASSISTANCE AND IN THE

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:39.802
APARTMENT INTERIOR WHATEVER

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:42.037
THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH THEIR

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:47.443
SEVENTEEN BILLION SO. IS IT. ONE

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:50.045
DOES THAT THE PACKAGE ROOM AND

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:51.347
GET WE WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.449
THE AYE AYE J. A. BUT SHOULD WE

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:57.286
BE THINKING OF READ RATHER THAN

01:10:57.353 --> 01:11:01.657
HOLDING BACK MONEY- ADJUSTING

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:02.992
THE APPROPRIATIONS WITH SOME OF

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:05.027
THE MONEY IS LIKE A BLOCK GRANT

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:07.129
SO THAT THE AGENCIES OR THE

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:09.632
DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:12.101
TO USE THE MONEY TO GO SEEK SOME

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.936
MORE FEDERAL MONEY VERSUS SPEND

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:16.572
THAT ON THE PURPOSES THAT HAVE

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.173
BEEN OUTLINED IN THE AGREEMENT

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.609
LAST YEAR IS IT IS IT WAS A LOT

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:21.944
OF THIS IS GOING QUICK AND WE

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.178
DON'T WANT TO HAVE I DON'T WANT

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:24.480
TO HAVE A SPECIAL. SESSION OR

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:26.815
SPECIAL HEARING AND IN JULY SO I

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:27.816
CAN THE SECOND CHANGE

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.184
APPROPRIATIONS SO THEY CAN DO

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.053
THIS INSTEAD OF THAT BUT YOU

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.188
KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GOING%

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:33.756
WITH THIS IS THAT IS THAT

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:34.790
THERE'S SO MUCH THAT'S ON THE

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:36.725
TABLE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:37.826
KNOW BUILDING RESILIENT

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:39.695
INFRASTRUCTURE THE BRICK PROGRAM

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:42.331
WITH THAT ALL MY SECURITY TO

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.866
BILLION DOLLARS AND AN OFFICIAL

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.601
WILDLIFE HE WE GOT THIS THING

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:46.702
ABOUT BUILDING RESILIENCY WE

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:49.705
THINK WE HAVE WE MEET HERE WE

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:51.340
CAN APPLY FOR THIS BUT WE DON'T

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:52.574
REALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY BY THE

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:55.844
LEGISLATURE COULD YOU COMMENT

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:57.012
ON. THAT YEAH I THINK IT'S A

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:59.248
FAIR. POINT THE TIMING IS

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:00.649
DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:02.518
THAT MUCH YET ABOUT THE

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.286
SPECIFICS ON THE FEDERAL-

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.288
PACKAGES IN ALLOCATIONS. NOR HOW

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:08.323
MUCH WILL FLOW THROUGH KIND OF

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:09.858
OUR STATE AGENCIES VERSUS LOCAL

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.660
AGENCIES JUST APPLYING DIRECTLY

01:12:11.727 --> 01:12:13.562
SOME OF THOSE- GRANTS ARE ARE

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:16.165
STRUCTURED THAT WAY. SO I THINK

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:19.234
AT SOME OF THE- CONSIDERATIONS

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:20.703
TO THINK ABOUT ARE WHAT WILL THE

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:21.970
STATE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:24.139
SPEED. EVEN ON THAT THREE POINT

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:25.140
EIGHT BILLION THAT WE KNOW THE

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.009
WATER BOARD WILL GET FOR CLEAN

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:29.678
DRINKING WATER. AND WASTEWATER

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:30.879
THERE WILL BE STATE SOME STATE

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.314
MATCHING REQUIREMENTS THERE SO

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:34.983
THINKING ABOUT- AS YOU MENTIONED

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:37.052
MISTER CHAIR WHAT FUNDING DO WE

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.587
NEED TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO BE

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:40.322
ABLE TO. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:42.458
OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY- AND ALSO

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:43.926
AVOIDING DUPLICATION AND

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:45.761
THINKING ABOUT IT WAREFARE

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.062
FORGETTING FEDERAL FUNDING FOR

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:48.363
SOME PURPOSES MAYBE THAT MEANS

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:49.832
THAT WE CAN REPURPOSE OUR STATE

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.233
DOLLARS FOR OTHER PRIORITIES

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.136
THAT DON'T HAVE IT- I DO THINK

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.337
IT'S A LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:57.239
PREMATURE BUT WE- AS YOU SAID

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.173
DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK IN

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.975
SEPTEMBER OCTOBER WHERE. THE

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.143
LEGISLATURE IS NOT IN SESSION

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.211
WE'RE GETTING FUNDING WE'RE

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:03.212
GETTING SECTION LETTERS THROUGH

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:04.646
THE JAIL B. C. AND WE'RE NOT

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:06.982
PREPARED SO. I MIGHT SUGGEST

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:09.084
THAT THAT SEEKING AN UPDATE IN A

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:10.686
COUPLE OF MONTHS PERHAPS WHEN

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:11.954
WE'RE STILL IN THE BUDGET

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.789
PROCESS AND IT'S NOT TOO LATE-

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:15.357
BUT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:16.859
INFORMATION THAN WE DO RIGHT

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:17.793
NOW. SOME REALLY IMPORTANT

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.461
CONSIDERATION OF. WHICH MEANS

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.263
IT'S A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD WERE.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.198
FOR DOING WHAT. PLAN THE

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:24.500
ACCOUNTABILITY DANCE SOMEWHERE

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:30.773
IT AND THEN REALIZED. THAT

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:32.241
PERHAPS WHO WOULD KNOW THAT IF

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:33.475
THE MONEY DIDN'T GO OUT THE

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.777
DOOR. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SEE

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:36.745
THAT WE'VE GOT GUIDELINES IN THE

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.147
DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR AND IF WE

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:44.853

CHANGED AND EXPONENTIALLY KIND

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.982
OF INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON OUR

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:57.885
HATCHERIES. BECAUSE OF THIS

01:35:57.952 --> 01:36:00.621
CLIMATE WISHED LASH AND THE

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:03.791
EFFECTS ON OUR FISH. SO THERE'S

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:05.025
A COUPLE OF BASIC FACTS I JUST

01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:07.761
WANT TO ESTABLISH WE OWN OR

01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:09.663
MANAGE TWENTY ONE TOTAL

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:11.765
HATCHERIES IN THE STATE. AND

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:13.667
THERE'S KIND OF TWO TYPES WONDER

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:16.270
FOR TRIAL INLAND. THE OTHER IS

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:18.339
FOR OUR ANADROMOUS SALMON STILL

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:20.875
HAD. AND I THINK YOUR QUESTIONS

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:22.543
ARE ABOUT THE ANADROMOUS ASPECT

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:24.578
AND THERE'S TEN OF THOSE

01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:26.347
HATCHERIES IN THE STATE. IN

01:36:26.413 --> 01:36:29.316
REALITY WE ONLY OWN ONE OF THEM

01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:30.484
. AND THAT'S THE MERCED RIVER

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:32.086
HATCHERY SO WE'VE GOT THIS

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:33.921
DYNAMIC WHERE ALL THE OTHERS ARE

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.523
OWNED BY THE BUREAU OF

01:36:35.589 --> 01:36:37.892
RECLAMATION THE ARMY CORPS WHICH

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:40.261
IS THE RUSSIAN RIVER RESERVOIR

01:36:40.327 --> 01:36:42.429
YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF

01:36:42.496 --> 01:36:43.030
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:46.066
EAST BAY MUD. SO THINKING ABOUT

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:48.669
REAL UPGRADE ISN'T ALWAYS JUST

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:52.339
CONTROLLED BY US BUT I CONFESS

01:36:52.406 --> 01:36:55.142
WE LEARNED. LESSONS LAST YEAR

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:58.078
WHICH WERE DISTURBING AND WE'RE

01:36:58.145 --> 01:37:00.447
MAKING IMPROVEMENTS UPON THAT.

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:02.750
SO WE'RE CURRENTLY AND THIS IS

01:37:02.816 --> 01:37:04.718
WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING WITHIN

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:05.886
THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:08.422
THAT'S LOOKING ACROSS EVERYONE

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:10.691
OF OUR ANADROMOUS HATCHERIES.

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:12.359
DEVELOPING FOR THOSE HATCHERIES

01:37:12.426 --> 01:37:13.627
ALL OF OUR CONTINGENCY PLANNING

01:37:13.694 --> 01:37:16.630
AN EXAMPLE. WE KNOW THESE

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:18.232
RESERVOIRS MAY NOT HAVE COLD

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:20.034
WATER IN THE FUTURE TO SUPPLIER

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.635
HATCHERIES WHICH ARE BELOW THE

01:37:21.702 --> 01:37:23.637
DANCE SO IT'S A GREAT STORY AS

01:37:23.704 --> 01:37:26.173
YOU MENTIONED WE COULD EVACUATE

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.174
WARM SPRINGS HATCHERY TO THE

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:28.809
HIGH SCHOOL. BUT WE ALSO TO

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:30.477
HATCHERY IN SANTA CRUZ THAT WAS

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:32.079
IMPACTED BY THE LAST ROUND OF

01:37:32.146 --> 01:37:34.014
FIRES CALL KING FISHER. WE'RE

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:36.717
TRYING TO GET IT BACK UP ONLINE

01:37:36.784 --> 01:37:38.018
AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE MAKING

01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:39.453
SURE WE HAVE THE ALL THE

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.021
CONTRACTING AND FINANCING. THE

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:42.189
SUPPORT THE HIGH SCHOOL IF WE

01:37:42.256 --> 01:37:43.991
NEED IT FOR A SECOND YEAR. WE'RE

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:46.527
WORKING THROUGH ALL KINDS OF

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:47.728
CONTINGENCIES FOR EACH MATCH.

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:49.063
AND THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:49.997
THIS QUESTION A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:52.032
WANT US TO DO. DIFFERENT TYPE OF

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:55.236
TAGGING THE FISH. THAT USES DNA.

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:56.870
AND I THINK THAT'S THE FUTURE

01:37:56.937 --> 01:37:59.873
IT'S CALLED PRINTED STACKING. IT

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.309
REALLY ALLOWS US TO OUR VERY.

01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:04.345
FINALLY DETERMINED THE PARENTS

01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:06.814
OF A FISH. RELATIVE TO HATCHERY

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.549
OR WILD. BUT IT'S NOT AN

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:10.951
OVERNIGHT TRANSITION ALL OF THE

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:12.553
WEST COAST ALASKA AND CANADA

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.956
USING EXISTING TECHNOLOGY ALL

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:17.524
CROWDED WATER TAX. SO THAT'S

01:38:17.591 --> 01:38:19.293
PROBABLY OUR FUTURE. BUT THERE

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.262
MAY BE A WAY WE USE THIS DNA

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:23.330
PARENTAGE TACKING TO DO FINER

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:25.399
SCALE WORK THAT SUPPLEMENTS AND

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:27.668
COMPLIMENTS. THOSE ARE THE KINDS

01:38:27.735 --> 01:38:29.637
OF THINGS I THINK THAT ARE IN

01:38:29.703 --> 01:38:30.504
OUR FUTURE. I APPRECIATE YOU

01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:32.339
RAISING THE QUESTION I'M I'M

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:34.441
COGNIZANT TODAY'S ITEMS HOLD

01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:36.443
OPEN GET. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:37.478
TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR NOW I

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:38.946
APPRECIATE IT BUT THE GUY I

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:39.947
THINK THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:41.548
THIS MONEY IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:42.883
TO USHER IN THE UPGRADE CENTERS

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:44.551
ARE NEEDED AND THAT'S- THERE'S

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:46.387
JUST NO WAY. AND WHILE I

01:38:46.453 --> 01:38:47.955
APPRECIATE IT MAY COMPLETE AN

01:38:48.022 --> 01:38:49.089
ASSESSMENT IT'S NOT GONNA BE

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:50.557
ABLE TO PUT IN THE FILTRATION

01:38:50.624 --> 01:38:51.492
SYSTEMS THE CHILLERS THAT WE'RE

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:53.627
GONNA NEED. AND LOOK AS MUCH AS

01:38:53.694 --> 01:38:55.062
WE MAY NOT OWN THE FACILITIES WE

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:57.298
DEPEND ON THE FACILITIES. FOR

01:38:57.364 --> 01:38:59.633
THE STOCK SO IN WE ALSO DEPEND

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:00.901
ON THE FACILITIES FOR THE

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.136
SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES AND I

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:04.305
THINK IT'S ALSO. IMPORTANT TO

01:39:04.371 --> 01:39:05.673
NOTE THAT FEDERAL SIDE THE

01:39:05.739 --> 01:39:06.874
COLEMAN HATCHERY IS ALREADY

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:10.077
ADVANCED THIS PARENTAGE- TAGGING

01:39:10.144 --> 01:39:11.779
AND IT WERE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:13.280
AT OREGON AND WASHINGTON YOU

01:39:13.347 --> 01:39:14.882
TAKEA LOOK AT ALASKA. THEY'VE

01:39:14.948 --> 01:39:16.250
ALREADY BEEN DOING THIS FOR

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:18.585
YEARS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO.

01:39:18.652 --> 01:39:21.322
MOVE INTO THAT SO I WOULD JUST

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:22.356
HOPE THAT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL

01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:24.158
FOCUS ON THIS AND WE'RE GONNA

01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:25.492
NEED ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN WE

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:27.328
HAVE TO MOVE WITH SPEED. ON THAT

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.896
AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT

01:39:28.962 --> 01:39:30.998
CONVERSATION MY LAST ITEM. IF IT

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:54.488
ISSUE HATCHERIES IN THE FUTURE.

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:55.489
WE'LL GET TO THAT AND SECOND

01:39:55.556 --> 01:40:03.564

TESTIMONY IN YOUR LEADERSHIP- WE

01:40:09.937 --> 01:40:11.839
ALL KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:14.007
DROUGHT IN THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:15.676
IN GENERAL IT'S VERY EASY TO HIT

01:40:15.743 --> 01:40:17.311
. THE SNOOZE ON THE ALARM CLOCK

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:19.413
AND ASSUME THAT JUST BECAUSE IT

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.715
RAINED AGAIN- WE'RE OUT OF THE

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:23.951

KNOWING THAT THERE'S NOT A SORT

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:33.327
OF YEAR TO YEAR DROUGHT CYCLE

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:34.528
ANYMORE BUT RATHER A GREAT

01:40:34.595 --> 01:40:36.930
DRYING WE'RE IN AN ERA OF A

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:37.831
REDUPLICATION FOR THE ENTIRE

01:40:37.898 --> 01:40:41.201
WEST. AND THIS IS NOT THE KIND

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:43.704
OF THING THAT. WILL GET LUCKY ON

01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:45.873
SAY IN ONE BUDGET CYCLE AND-

01:40:45.939 --> 01:40:47.841
PERHAPS NOT HAVE TO SPEND ON

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:49.376
THIS I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW IF

01:40:49.443 --> 01:40:50.778
THERE'S ANY CONCERN I HAVE IS

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:52.579
THAT WERE UNDER INVESTING HERE

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:54.415
IN GENERAL. I APPRECIATE THE

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:57.551
CONTINGENCY FUNDS ON THE TWO AND

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:58.519
A FIFTY MILLION- AND IF THERE IS

01:40:58.585 --> 01:40:59.820
FEDERAL FUNDING POTENTIALLY

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:02.156
COMING IN AS WELL. BUT WHEN YOU

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:04.358
LOOK AT THE SCALE OF. OF WHAT

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:06.460
THE DROUGHT. THAT IS GOING TO

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:10.264
CONSUME THE ENTIRE WEST FOR. THE

01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:13.967
FORESEEABLE FUTURE- ENTAILS EVEN

01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:15.702
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION

01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:18.572
LIKE MINE- THE SCALE OF

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:23.043
INVESTMENT IS MASSIVE I WANTED

01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:24.044
TO I KNOW SECRETARY BLUMENFELD

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:26.213
SPOKE- LAST MONTH ABOUT. THE

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.348
SCALE OF NEEDED IN ONE OF THESE

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:29.917
CATEGORIES AND WATER RECYCLING

01:41:29.983 --> 01:41:33.454
IN PARTICULAR- WHERE I THINK

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.755
THERE'S A BILLION DOLLARS

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:38.025
AVAILABLE TO ALL WESTERN STATES

01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:39.326
IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:42.930
DOLLARS A YEAR- BUT THAT. THE

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:44.965
SECRETARY POINTED OUT LAST MONTH

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:46.934
DID THE NEEDS FOR RECYCLED WATER

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.669
IN CALIFORNIA EXCEED TEN BILLION

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:50.671
AND IN FACT THE NEEDS JUST FOR

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:52.639
THE LA BASIN ALONE EXCEED TWELVE

01:41:52.706 --> 01:41:54.508
BILLION DOLLARS IF YOU LOOK AT

01:41:54.575 --> 01:41:56.076
OPERATION NEXT TO THE UPGRADES

01:41:56.143 --> 01:41:57.845
TO HYPERION THAT ARE GONNA BE

01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:59.813
REQUIRED IN CARSON- FOR THE

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:03.684
LARGER MET PROJECTS- WE DON'T. I

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:06.653
DON'T REALLY SEE A LOT HERE ON.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.388
CONTINUING THAT THAT WATER

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:10.691
RECYCLING PUSH AND EVEN LAST

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:12.125
YEAR'S FUN WELL APPRECIATED I

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:14.094
DON'T I THINK. DIDN'T BEGIN TO

MEET THE NEEDS MAYBE OF BOTH THE

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:17.698
VERY LARGE PROJECTS LIKE THE

01:42:17.764 --> 01:42:19.867
ONES I JUST MENTIONED BUT ALSO-

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:21.935
SOME OF THE SMALLER WATER

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:24.938
DISTRICTS. IN RURAL OR- SEMI

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:26.974
RURAL AREAS THAT ARE STRUGGLING

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.476
TO FINANCE THIS. THIS SOUTHERN

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:31.245
CALIFORNIA ATTEMPT TO BE WATER

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.513
RESILIENT OURSELVES SO THAT WE

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:33.714
DON'T HAVE TO IMPORT AS MUCH

01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:34.848
FROM THE NORTH WE CAN TAKE

01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:36.550
PRESSURE OFF AGRICULTURE WE CAN

01:42:36.617 --> 01:42:38.318
TAKE PRESSURE OFF OF. NORTHERN

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.720
CALIFORNIA PRESSURE OFF THE

01:42:39.786 --> 01:42:41.755
DELTA- THESE ARE NO REGRETS

01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:44.525
INVESTMENT SO I JUST WANT TO

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:28.168
IT'S CONSISTENT NATURE- AND-

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:30.103
ABILITY TO REUSE WHAT'S

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:33.040
OTHERWISE UNUSED- AND NOT PUT TO

01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:34.207
BENEFICIAL USE WATER CURRENTLY

01:45:59.219 --> 01:46:01.788
INTENDED USE REPORT AND- AND

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:03.390
THEN DRILL DOWN DEEPER THERE BUT

01:46:03.457 --> 01:46:05.192
DO APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION OF

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:08.395
THIS- IN THE SCALE OF NEED AT

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:09.496
CERTAINLY OUTSTRIPPING OUR

01:46:09.563 --> 01:46:10.964

DIRECTOR NEMETH- BUT THE OTHER

01:46:20.741 --> 01:46:22.309
ANOTHER CRIME IMPACTED WE OFTEN

01:46:22.375 --> 01:46:24.177
DON'T TALK ABOUT CERTAINLY IN

01:46:24.244 --> 01:46:25.812
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FLOODS-

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:27.547
DESPITE BEING IN A MASSIVE FLOOD

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:29.282
PLAIN AND HAVING TREMENDOUS

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:31.151
RISKS WE KNOW THAT. THEY ALSO

01:46:31.218 --> 01:46:34.087
EXIST- IN THE FAR NORTH- WE'VE

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:35.555
SEEN THE MODELS AND ANDERSON

01:46:35.622 --> 01:46:38.258
DAM- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:39.760
ISSUE EVERYWHERE BUT PEOPLE

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:42.195
OFTEN DON'T THINK OF THE LA AREA

01:46:42.262 --> 01:46:45.165
BEING AT RISK I WAS CURIOUS HOW

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:47.267
I KNOW THE RESULTS WE DID THREE

01:46:47.334 --> 01:46:48.769
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FLOOD

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:50.771
MANAGEMENT LAST YEAR THERE'S

01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:52.205
ALSO BEEN SOME TO ME SOME

01:46:52.272 --> 01:46:54.207
EXCITING PROGRESS OCCURRING IN

WITH HE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS

01:46:58.812 --> 01:46:59.846
ON THIS ENGINEERING WITH NATURE

01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:01.948
INITIATIVE I JUST WANTED TO GET

01:47:02.015 --> 01:47:04.050
YOUR TAKE ON WHETHER. YOU THINK

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:06.353
THERE ARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:07.821
FLOOD CONTROL INVESTMENT

01:47:07.888 --> 01:47:09.756
STRATEGY AND I DON'T SEE A LINE

01:47:09.823 --> 01:47:11.825
ITEM FOR THAT IN THE CURRENT

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:13.527
PROPOSED DROUGHT RESPONSE

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.128
ACTIVITIES BUT MAYBE JUST GIVE

01:47:15.195 --> 01:47:17.097
US A SENSE OF WHAT WHAT YOU'RE

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:18.999
UP TO THESE DAYS ON THAT POT

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:21.034
FROM THE FLOOD CONTROL FRONT AND

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:23.003
WHETHER THERE'S ANY HOPE FOR US

01:47:23.069 --> 01:47:25.038
AND SEVEN CALIFORNIA TO

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:26.673
POTENTIALLY PARTNER WITH WITH T.

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:27.974
W. AREN'T EVEN THE FEDERAL

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:30.577
GOVERNMENT IN A PLACE LIKE CITY-

01:47:30.644 --> 01:47:31.711
YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT LAKE

01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:34.781
BALBOA THE- AS THE SPOT WHERE

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:36.917
YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL A MASSIVE

01:47:36.983 --> 01:47:39.553
DAM- AND WE TO SPREADING

01:47:39.619 --> 01:47:42.088
GROUNDS- RIGHT IN THE AREA BUT-

01:47:42.155 --> 01:47:43.990
THAT. YOU KNOW WE WE'D RATHER

01:47:44.057 --> 01:47:46.126
NOT JUST HARD ENGINEER OUR WAY

01:47:46.193 --> 01:47:48.328
THROUGH ALL THIS AND JUST BUILD

01:47:48.395 --> 01:47:50.330
UP FLOOD FLOOD- CANALS AND

01:47:50.397 --> 01:47:52.999
INSTEAD TRY TO FIND WAYS TO SAY

01:47:53.066 --> 01:47:55.068
EXPAND NATIVE WETLANDS OR USE

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:59.973
OTHER. CERTAIN NATURE BASED

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:00.607
INFRASTRUCTURE SO. K. YOU JUST

01:48:00.674 --> 01:48:02.175
GIVE A LITTLE MOVE INSIGHT ON

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:04.177
HOW THINGS ARE UP FLOW CONTROL.

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:07.581
AND MAYBE OUTLOOK FOR SEVEN.

01:48:07.647 --> 01:48:08.748
ABSOLUTELY SENATOR AND THAT'S A

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:10.083
TERRIFIC QUEST SO. A COUPLE OF

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:12.419
THINGS THERE- YOU KNOW AS A

01:48:12.485 --> 01:48:16.289
GENERAL MATTER- THE DEPARTMENT

01:48:16.356 --> 01:48:18.425
IS COMPLETING- OR AT LEAST

01:48:18.491 --> 01:48:20.260
STARTING ON ITS UPDATE OF THE

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:23.129
CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN. AND THAT

01:48:23.196 --> 01:48:26.199
IS SOMETHING THAT'S LEGISLATED-

01:48:26.266 --> 01:48:27.801
HAD MANDATED BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:27.868 --> 01:48:30.103
THAT D. W. R. UPDATE EVERY-

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:33.173
EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO THE THRUST

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:36.343
OF THIS- THIS UPDATE IS IT IS

01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:38.345
REALLY CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:41.348
TAKING A WATERSHED SCALE LOOK.

01:48:41.414 --> 01:48:45.185
AT HOW WE NOT ONLY PROVIDE FOR

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:49.289
AWHILE- THESE MULTI BENEFIT

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:51.358
PROJECTS THAT ALSO- ENHANCE

01:48:51.424 --> 01:48:53.426
FLOOD PROTECTION FOR COMMUNITIES

01:48:53.493 --> 01:48:56.963
SO- YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:59.332
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THESE

01:48:59.399 --> 01:49:02.202
PIECES FIT TOGETHER. AND THAT

01:49:02.269 --> 01:49:05.405
WILL SUGGEST- FUTURE APPROACHES

01:49:05.472 --> 01:49:07.874
TO FUNDING THAT- MAKE THOSE

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:10.577
CONNECTIONS EVEN STRONGER- THAN

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:12.178
THAN WE'VE BEEN DOING REALLY IN

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:14.314
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS- AS

01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:16.883
PART OF PROPOSITION ONE- YOU MAY

REMEMBER THAT WE HAD- HALF A

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:21.087
BILLION DOLLARS IN THERE FOR

01:49:21.154 --> 01:49:23.223
WHAT WE CALL MULTI BENEFIT FLOOD

01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:25.225
PROTECTION- AND THOSE ARE THE

01:49:25.292 --> 01:49:27.727
DOLLARS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:49:27.794 --> 01:49:31.097
BEEN. EXPANDING ON- OUR URBAN

01:49:31.164 --> 01:49:33.133
WRIST WORK URBAN RISK FLOOD

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:35.435
REDUCTION PROGRAM- AND OTHER

IS A- THE- A LIST OF- KINDS OF

01:50:03.797 --> 01:50:05.231
PROJECTS THAT THE ARMY CORPS OF

01:50:26.886 --> 01:50:28.254
ENGINEERING WITH NAY BUT ALSO. A

01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:31.424
REAL TIGHT- INTEGRATE BETWEEN.

01:50:31.491 --> 01:50:33.560

PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL. SO I WANT TO

01:55:14.974 --> 01:55:16.509
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THIS

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:18.878
PROGRAM IS SO IMPORTANT AT ONE

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:20.913
MAJOR REASON IS THAT LAST YEAR

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.749
WE STARTED ONE BILLION MEALS IN

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:24.817
SCHOOLS AND THAT WAS IN THE

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:26.819
MIDST OF A OF A PANDEMIC BUT

01:55:26.886 --> 01:55:28.154
THAT MANY MANY CHALLENGES THAT

01:55:28.221 --> 01:55:30.023
OUR SCHOOL NUTRITION DIRECTORS

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:31.858
HAD ADMINISTRATORS AND FAMILIES.

01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:33.626
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SCHOOL

01:55:33.693 --> 01:55:39.165
MEALS AS AS EVEN MORE ACUTE. NOW

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:40.133
THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN. THIS

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:42.001
PRESS. IS ABOUT NENE'S. WHO THIS

01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:43.603
IS GAME OF INTEREST MILK THEY'LL

01:55:43.670 --> 01:55:46.005
GET AND CASES UNFORTUNATELY IT

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:48.074
MAY NOT IT MAY BE THE ONLY KNOW

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:50.276
THAT THEY GET. IN THE SCHOOL DAY

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:52.645
AND SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:54.247
FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS AS WE

01:55:54.314 --> 01:55:55.682
FIGHT HUNGER AND IMPROVE

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:58.251
SECURITY. BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT

01:55:58.318 --> 01:56:00.053
TO EMPHASIZE ABOUT THIS IS THAT

01:56:00.119 --> 01:56:02.488
IS A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SCHOOL

01:56:02.555 --> 01:56:04.957
MALES. TO BUILDING OUT AND

01:56:05.024 --> 01:56:06.459
IMPROVING THE RESILIENCY OF

01:56:06.526 --> 01:56:09.896
LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS BY EXPANDING

01:56:09.962 --> 01:56:12.065
LOCAL PROCUREMENT BY OUR LARGEST

01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:13.733
INSTITUTIONS. AND MOST

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.235
IMPORTANTLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:17.870
THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING THAT

01:56:17.937 --> 01:56:19.505
CAME OUT LAST YEAR ONE OF THE

01:56:19.572 --> 01:56:20.840
EARLY COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE AND

01:56:20.907 --> 01:56:22.842
THAT. IS THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE

01:56:22.909 --> 01:56:24.644
ABOUT HEALTHY AGING IN EVERY

01:56:24.711 --> 01:56:27.480
DECADE. AND THOSE YOUNG DECADES

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:28.548
ARE THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN MAKE

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:29.615
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE I'VE

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:31.184
CITING HEALTH CARE'S HEALTHCARE

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:32.952
COSTS BY REDUCING CHRONIC

01:56:33.019 --> 01:56:34.887
DISEASE BY IMPROVING NUTRITION

01:56:34.954 --> 01:56:36.289
AND HOW WE EAT AND HOW WE

01:56:36.356 --> 01:56:37.523
EXERCISE STARTING FROM THE

01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:41.127
YOUNGEST AGES- BCP WOULD ALLOW

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:43.963
US TO EXPAND ON A PILOT PROGRAM.

01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:46.933

WORKGROUP PROCESS SO IN TWENTY

01:57:05.184 --> 01:57:06.953
TWENTY WE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL

01:57:07.019 --> 01:57:07.754
TWO HUNDRED STAKEHOLDERS THAT

01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:09.222
ARE LEARNING ABOUT THIS ONE TO

01:57:09.288 --> 01:57:12.058
BE A PART OF THAT. IN TWENTY

01:57:12.125 --> 01:57:13.493
TWENTY ONE WE HOSTED A STATEWIDE

01:57:13.559 --> 01:57:17.163

BUT ALSO THE PANDEMIC REALLY

01:58:00.973 --> 01:58:02.642
COMPOUNDED FOR PEOPLE THE

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:04.110

EFFICIENT WAY OF GETTING BULK

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:28.447

TO SOURCE MORE AND MORE LOCALLY.

02:01:30.249 --> 02:01:32.084

BUY. A CERTAIN SCALE THEY NEED

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:53.239

02:01:59.545 --> 02:02:02.048
TRYING TO BUILD OUT. A LOCAL

02:02:02.114 --> 02:02:04.316
FOOD SYSTEM. THAT CAN BETTER

02:02:04.383 --> 02:02:05.651
MATCH WHAT'S BEING GROWN IN THAT

MATCHING WHERE THE DEMAND YES.

02:02:17.096 --> 02:02:18.698
AND ALIGNING THAT WITH WHAT'S

02:02:18.764 --> 02:02:25.738

THAT'S NOT THE GREATEST AT FOUR

02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:51.030

THEY'RE JUST NOT INDUSTRY FUNDS

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:56.782
IT'S A CHALLENGING TIME TO BE A

02:10:56.848 --> 02:10:58.884
HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN OR

UNIQUE ABOUT THIS WELL I'VE

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:22.774
ALREADY MENTIONED ITS FIRST IN

02:11:22.841 --> 02:11:24.543
THE NATION KIND OF WORK THAT'S

02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:26.311

MOREOVER. ITSELF PIONEERING

02:11:28.814 --> 02:11:31.250
APPROACH I MEAN IT'S THIS IS

02:11:31.316 --> 02:11:32.484
CUTTING EDGE. WHAT WE'RE

02:11:32.551 --> 02:11:34.019

THAT'S WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS

02:12:14.926 --> 02:12:17.496
APPROACH. WE'RE LEARNING FROM IT

02:12:17.562 --> 02:12:19.631
OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:22.234
FOLLOWING OUR LEAD. AND WHAT

WE'RE LEARNING ON THE DUNGENESS

02:12:23.902 --> 02:12:25.937
CRAB FISHERY. COULD EVENTUALLY

02:12:26.004 --> 02:12:27.572
BE APPLIED TO OUR OTHER STATE

02:12:27.639 --> 02:12:29.908

02:12:34.079 --> 02:12:37.082
LIABILITY EXPOSURE IF ANYONE

WHALES AND SEA TURTLES WAS

02:13:06.912 --> 02:13:10.182
HAPPENING. THE STATE'S LIABILITY

02:13:10.248 --> 02:13:11.750
FOR THAT ALLEGED VIOLATION

02:13:11.817 --> 02:13:13.752
CONTINUES UNTIL WE GET A FEDERAL

02:13:13.819 --> 02:13:16.254
PERMIT. AND THIS FUNDING IS FOR

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:17.122
THE PURPOSES OF GETTING THAT

02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:20.092
FEDERAL PERMIT. COULD I GET

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.541
PROTECTIVE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

02:13:36.608 --> 02:13:38.176
SO THERE'S RISK IN THE FUTURE.

02:13:38.243 --> 02:13:40.212
BUT THIS FUNDING REALLY REDUCES

02:13:40.278 --> 02:13:42.047
THE RISK BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:45.751

02:14:54.486 --> 02:14:55.620
PRACTICE WE CAN PURSUE IN THE

02:14:55.687 --> 02:14:58.023

HERE- ON THE ISSUE OF FEES AND I

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.436
JUST AND I THINK THAT WE ALL

02:15:11.503 --> 02:15:13.271
LIVED. THE DREAM THAT YEAR WHEN

02:15:13.338 --> 02:15:16.341
AS THE POTENTIAL OF RAISING FEES

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:18.109
TO ASTRONOMICAL AMOUNTS ON A

02:15:18.176 --> 02:15:21.046
STRUGGLING FLEET SO- I AGREE

02:15:21.112 --> 02:15:24.349
WITH THE DIRECTOR THAT HOPE THAT

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:25.417
WE DON'T SEE THAT COME BACK

02:15:25.484 --> 02:15:26.885

02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:28.954
THAT CALL IN THEIR NUMBER ONE IN

02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:31.189
THE NUMBER TWO I THINK FROM THAT

02:15:31.256 --> 02:15:31.923
THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A LOT OF

02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:34.159
COORDINATION. AND IT'S BEEN

02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:35.927
INCREDIBLE TO SEE THE FLEET

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:37.262
COMING TOGETHER EVEN WHEN

02:15:37.329 --> 02:15:39.197
THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO BE ABLE TO

02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:43.101
ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY-

02:15:43.168 --> 02:15:46.271
ALTERNATIVES TO POTENTIAL. OF

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:49.374
THAT GEAR ADDED TO OTHER PIECES-

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:50.809
THEY'VE ACTUALLY CLOSED

02:15:50.876 --> 02:15:56.781
PROACTIVELY WHEN THEIR WHALES AT. PRESENT IN THE- HARTMAN ALONG

02:15:56.848 --> 02:15:57.616
WITH THE FLEET ARE AND-

02:15:57.682 --> 02:15:59.551

02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:01.887
THIS YEAR AS AN EXAMPLE- THE

02:16:01.953 --> 02:16:03.555
DIRECTOR AND I WERE ABLE TO SIT

CAN BE MOVING OUT AND IT WORKED

02:16:18.436 --> 02:16:20.205
AND I THINK THAT- I DO SO BUT WE

02:16:20.272 --> 02:16:23.308
NEVER GO BACK TO THE RAISING OF

02:16:23.375 --> 02:16:25.010

02:19:21.886 --> 02:19:24.122
PRIORITY AND HAS TAKEN A LONG

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:26.157

AREAS TO PURSUE IF THERE ARE

02:19:38.002 --> 02:19:43.141
