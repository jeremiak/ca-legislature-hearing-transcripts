ALL RIGHT GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I CARE TO I PROBABLY PRESENTS ARE MEASURE -- FREE THE VOTE A CA SIX WHICH IS A MEASURE TO PUT THE ISSUE ON THE BALLOT WE'RE NOT DECIDING HERE TODAY. THIS POLICY ISSUE SENSUALLY WOULD GIVE THOSE ON PAROLE THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR THEIR SENTENCE -- A CHANCE TO VOTE ONCE -- THEY ARE -- FREED AND FOCUS ON FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND RE INTEGRATING INDIVIDUALS BACK INTO SOCIETY WE KNOW OUR COUNTRY IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRACY BUT VOTING HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THAT EASY. FROM RACIALLY BASED POLL TAXES TO EXCLUDING WOMEN TO VOTE WE'VE HAD OUR CHALLENGE OF HIS WITH VOTING JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY. AND AND THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WHICH ALLOWED CALMLY INCARCERATED. A CHANCE TO GET BACK INTO SOCIETY THEY'VE ALREADY PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY YEAH THEY'RE PAYING THEIR TAXES AND CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AS WELL HERE IN A FEW SECONDS. THIS ISN'T A FRANKLY A RED STATE ISSUE OR A BLUE STATE ISSUE INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH MANY STATES LIKE NORTH DAKOTA UTAH AND FLORIDA. ARE DOING THIS FLORIDA JUST HAD A MAJOR ELECTION RECENTLY. TO RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS FOR THOSE FORMALLY INCARCERATED -- BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE ARE TWO STATES IN OUR COUNTRY WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO VOTE FROM PRISON. MAINE AND VERMONT TO ONE ACTUALLY IS A DEMOCRAT STATE WON THE REPUBLICAN STATE. JUST FOR THE RECORD WE'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT HERE TODAY. REALLY TALKING ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE -- HAVE BEEN COMMITTED CONVICTED AND RELEASED AND ARE ON PAROLE RESTORING THOSE VOTING RIGHTS. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT RE INTEGRATING PEOPLE BACK IN SOCIETY I THINK IT'S A MORAL ISSUE. DON'T YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE ON PAROLE WE'VE TAKEN GREAT STEPS HERE TO TO BAN THE BOX TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET BACK INTO EMPLOYMENT ON ON HOUSING -- MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE RE INTEGRATE INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES THIS IS ANOTHER STEP ALONG THE WAY. AND RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS FOR EVERYBODY SO -- THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY -- WITH ME IS -- TIGHT ENOUGH VARGAS ADMIN FOUNDER OF INITIATE JUSTICE AND TERRACE CYPRIAN FOR ALL OF US ARE NOT. NOW ALLOW THEM -- TO TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING. GOOD MORNING KAREN MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIENE OF ARGUS ADMIN I'M THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INITIATE JUSTICE AND WE'RE AN ORGANIZATION THAT ACTIVATES THE POLITICAL POWER PEOPLE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY MASS INCARCERATION. WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF A CA SIX BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE VOTING IS A FUNDAMENTAL CIVIL RIGHT AND THAT ALL OF SOCIETY SUFFERS WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. THE REMOVAL OF THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS NOT BASED IN AN INTEREST IN PUBLIC SAFETY BUT IN A PUNITIVE JUSTICE BELIEF SYSTEM THAT INTENTIONALLY ATTEMPTS TO A ROB TO ROB MARGINALIZED PEOPLE THEIR POLITICAL POWER. WHILE MOST OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES NEVER REMOVE A PERSON'S RIGHT TO VOTE DO DO A FELONY CONVICTION THE UNITED STATES HAS SOME OF THE QUOTE HARSHEST FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT LAWS IN THE WORLD ACCORDING TO HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH. AND REMAINS THE ONLY DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD WHERE A CITIZEN COULD POTENTIALLY RECEIVE A LIFETIME BAN FROM VOTING. THESE RESTRICTIONS PERSISTS DESPITE THE FACT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE HARSHER VOTING RESTRICTIONS ARE THE HIGHER ARE THE RATES OF RECIDIVISM. A STUDY CONDUCTED BY UC BERKELEY ARGUE THAT FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT QUOTE RESULT IN ALIENATION AND ISOLATION WHICH ONLY SERVES TO INCREASE FURTHER INCIDENCES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. IF ONE HAS NO STAKE IN HIS OR HER COMMUNITY THEN ONE HAS LITTLE INCENTIVE TO BEHAVE IN A PRO SOCIAL MANNER OTHER THAN TO AVOID PUNISHMENT. A SIMILAR SURVEY CONDUCTED BY INITIATE JUSTICE LAST YEAR OF MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN PRISON ON PAROLE CONFIRMS THIS. VOTING WOULD HELP THEM FEEL MORE CONNECTED TO THEIR COMMUNITIES THREE OUT OF FOUR PEOPLE ON PAROLE DIRECTLY SAID THE VOTING WOULD HELP THEM STAY OUT OF JAIL. MUCH OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS MOVING TOWARD ENDING FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT AND IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE PART OF THIS MOMENTUM. LAST YEAR ALONE STATES SUCH AS NEW YORK LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA COLLECTIVELY RESTORED VOTING RIGHTS TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. THIS YEAR'S SUCH STATES SUCH AS COLORADO NEVADA RESTORED VOTING RIGHTS TO PEOPLE ON PAROLE AND EVEN CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING THE DEMOCRACY RESTORATION ACT WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO VOTE IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS. NOW CALIFORNIA'S TURN. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ON PAROLE WHO ARE SHOT OUT OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND THE TIME HAS COME TO END THIS EXCLUSION. DEMOCRACY NEEDS EVERYONE THEREFOREI URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON A CA SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT'S WHEN IS A GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF SIMILAR MCCARTY MY NAME IS DARCY BRAND AND I'M WITHIN YOUR GONNA EITHER WHAT ALL OF US AND NOT. ON FOR MCCARTY RATED AND ARMED CRIMINAL PEROT. AND JUST PRETTY FR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR ALL OF US NINE WHERE A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED. GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT FORMED BY A FULL FORM ACROSS RID OF PEOPLE. WITH THE WITH THE GOAL OF UNITING AND STRENGTHENING OUR VOICES ARE VISIBILITY NOW LEADERSHIP IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THOSE VOICES. HAVE THOSE VOICES IN UNITED IN SUPPORT FOR A CA. SIX I LIKE SOME IN A VOICE NOT REPRESENT TODAY I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. HOWEVER THERE WAS SOME THIRTY THREE YEARS AGO -- I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD I REMEMBER THE DAY -- VERY VIVIDLY I WENT TO THE POLLS OF MY FATHER -- WE CAST OUR BALLOTS AND ON THE WAY HOME. ON THE DRIVE HOME I REMEMBER THE LOOK ON HIS FACE I HAD SEEN THAT LOOK ON YOU KNOW SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE. AND IT WAS A LOOK THAT I HAD SEEN -- WHEN I WHEN I WHEN I WHEN I WON A SPELLING BEE IN FOURTH GRADE ARE WHEN I GOT A IN SEVENTH GRADE AND IN JUNE HIGHER WHEN I HIT A HOME RUN? YOU KNOW HE WAS SPROUT. HE WAS PROUD OF ME. YOU KNOW -- I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT THEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY -- BUT I GET IT TODAY ARM SO. YOU SEE WHEN MY FATHER WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD. IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES -- HE FACED A DIFFERENT KIND OF VOTER SUPPRESSION HE BASS HE FACED A DIFFERENT LOOKING. ARE JIM CROW -- BUT MAKE NO TO MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS THE SAME JIM CROW WE SEE TODAY IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHAT FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT. STOP NO FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT SERVE NO. IT SERVES NO LEGITIMATE LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE IF THERE'S NO POLITICAL IF THERE'S NO PUBLIC POLICY -- IF SERVE NO PUBLIC POLICY PURPOSE. ON THE NORMAL -- NERVOUS HERE SO HE GIVES ME A GREAT DEGREE -- CUTTING DISENFRANCHISEMENT THAT BE JUST ANOTHER TERM FOR VOTER SUPPRESSION IT ABSOLUTELY SERVE NO LEGITIMATE LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE NO PUBLIC PURPOSE POLICY NO PUBLIC SAFETY POLICY WHAT IT DOES FOR VAST IS A SIGN OF POWER IN THE PRIMITIVE THAT DERIVE FROM A STRATEGY TO POLITICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. NOW ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND PEROT -- PEROT HAS A THREE FOLD PURPOSE ONE IS THE FIFTH PEOPLE ON PAROLE WERE PROBLEMS COULD START EMPLOYMENT RESIDENTS FINANCES. AND OTHER PROBLEMS PEOPLE FACE COMING HOME FROM PRISON NUMBER TWO PEROT PROTECT SOCIETY BECAUSE IT THE FIFTH FORM ACROSS RATED PEOPLE AND GETTING ACCLIMATED TO COMMUNITIES. AND PREVENTING FITS A WHITE SAYS THAT MAKE CALLS ON RECIDIVISM AND THREE PEROT PREVENTS NEEDLESS INCARCERATION OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT LIKELY TO RECEIVE A VERY. SO JUST THINK CLOSE I WANT TO SAY THIS COMMITTEE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TODAY. ACTUALLY I BELIEVE THIS COMMITTEE HAS AN OBLIGATION TODAY -- TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY. AND NOT ALLOW THE VESTED OF JIM CROW TO CONTINUE PRESS OUR CITIZENS -- I'M A CITIZEN I'M YOU KNOW I'M TOLD ON THE SET OF SAN. I HAVE ALL THE BURDENS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A CITIZEN. I'M A TAX PAYING CITIZEN. YEAH I DON'T HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS A CITIZEN. I HAVE NO SAY IN ON HOW MY TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT I HAVE NO SAY IN WHAT ELECTED OFFICIAL REPRESENTS ME MY ISSUES. ALL MY FAMILY ARE ISSUES OUR COMMUNITY. SO YOU KNOW WE ALL AWARE OF THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY YOU KNOW THAT WHICH IS MARKED BY SUCCESSFUL STRUGGLES -- TO EXPAND THE BODY RIGHT FROM -- FOR DIFFERENT REASONS FOR RACE -- GENDER OR CLASS. SO. WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THAT EXPANSION? WE CAN CONTAIN A BAN ON EXPANSION TODAY THIS DEATH COMMITTEE HAVE AN OPPORTUNIST IN A MESSAGE TO CALIFORNIA'S INSTEAD OF FROM ACROSS THE NATION.

THANK YOU STRONG SUPPORT OF NOT. DOING THIS THING BUT HE CRIMINALS. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS SCOTT BUCKLING BRITAIN I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. AND I'D LIKE TO RETURN THREE COME ONCE YOU COME ON UP SO YEAH. THE REGRET COME ON OUT YEAH THAT WORKS. PERFECT. MY NAME IS SUCKLING BRITAIN I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA I HAVE A COPY OF THE POSITION PAPERS TO HAND OUT TO EVERYBODY. ON THE COMMITTEE. ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA OPPOSES A CA. SIX A IT SEEKS TO RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS TO THE MOST FOR WHICH ARE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL INVALUABLE OF AMERICAN PRIVILEGES TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED MAKING FULL RESTITUTION FOR THEIR CRIMES. IN BREAKING IN A CONTRACT THE OFFENDER RELINQUISHES HIS RIGHTS UNDER THE CONTRACT. THOSE BREAKING THE SOCIAL CONTRACT RIGHTFULLY SURRENDER THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE CONTRACT PHYSICAL LIBERTY AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS OF FREE PERSON. ONE OF THOSE RIGHTS IS JOINING THE FELLOW CITIZENS IN THE DECISION MAKING ACTIVITIES RELEVANT TO A SOCIETY. INCLUDING AND ESPECIALLY VOTING. FUNDAMENTALLY THE CORNERSTONE OF AMERICAN SOCIAL CONTRACT IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PAY ONCE DEBT TO ONE SOCIETY AND THEN TO BE ONCE AGAIN GRANTED FULL PRIVILEGES. BUT THE FULL DEBT. AS DETERMINED BY. BY THE LEGAL STRUCTURE MUST BE PAID FIRST. AC A SIX TO RESTORE THOSE VOTING RIGHTS TO THEM THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL AND VALUABLE OF AMERICAN PRIVILEGES. TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED AND MAKING FULL RESTITUTION TO THEIR CRIMES. WHILE ON PAROLE A FORMER CRIMINALS LIBERTIES SUCH AS MOVEMENT ASSOCIATION ACTIVITIES -- EVEN OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN ITEMS ARE STILL HEAVILY RESTRICTED AND REGULARLY MONITORED BY THE SYSTEM. ANY MISSTEP RESULTS IN THE MEDIA RICK RE INCARCERATION. IN OTHER WORDS AN INDIVIDUAL ON PEARL HAS NOT REGAINED THE FULL TRUST OF THE SOCIETY AT LARGE. NOR THE PRIVILEGE OF TO PARTICIPATE AS A FULL MEMBER OF THAT SOCIETY. IT IS AGREED THAT RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS DURING A PAROLE MAY SERVE TO GRANT PAROLEES A SENSE OF PARTICIPATION AND BELONGING. AND THUS REDUCE RECIDIVISM THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FROM WHICH TO DRAW THAT CONCLUSION. THE FACT IS COUNTER INTUITIVE A PERIOD OF PAROLE GIVES A FORMER CRIMINAL A POWERFUL REMINDER OF WHAT TRUE LIBERTY IS BY WITHHOLDING JUST ENOUGH OF IT. TO BE AN INCENTIVE TO FURTHER APPROVED APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR. THAT IS TO EARN THE RIGHTS JUST BEYOND THE FINGER TIPS. SINCE VOTING IS THE MOST PRECIOUS OF ALL AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES IT SHOULD BE THE LAST TO BE REGAINED. THE GREATEST CARROT FOR FULL RIEN INTEGRATION AND RE COMMITMENT TO THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. PLEASE DO NOT CHEAPEN EVERY CITIZENS REINFORCEMENT RIBS -- RIEN FRENCH ENFRANCHISEMENT I'M SORRY BY -- RESTORING IT TO THOSE WHO HAVE CARELESSLY THROWN AWAY AND HAVE NOT FULLY RETURNED IT. TO DO SO WOULD BE DENIGRATE THE VALUE AN INSULT THE WHOLE CIVIL SOCIETY ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. URGES A NO VOTE ON A CA SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YES MY NAME IS ROLE RODRIGUEZ AND I AM CALIFORNIA COORDINATOR FOR AMERICA FIRST LATINOS. AND I OPPOSE. A SEE A 61100%. OUR CONSTITUTION STATES THAT WE LIVE A REPUBLIC AND A DEMOCRACY THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. MY NAME IS DIANA BARBA I'M A CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA I FEEL THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS BEING. OVERLOOKED. THESE PEOPLE MADE A CHOICE WHEN THEY CHOSE TO COMMIT A CRIME AND THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS UNTIL THAT DEBT IS FULLY FOR SO I DISAGREE WITH THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAVE WITNESSES CAN JUST I'VE BEEN GIVEN YOUR NAME IF YOU'RE REPRESENTING AN ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL. THANK YOU ARE THEY CA I'M GLAD MYERS I AM A VOTER AND A CONCERNED CITIZEN AND I'M AGAINST AC. A SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ROBIN FITS IN WITH THE REMEMBRANCE PROJECT AND WE URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PATRICE LINES WITH THE RIP MEMBERS PROJECT AND I ARE GENOVA THANK YOU. STILL IN MAY AND I'M WITH THE CONCERNED CITIZEN TO CALIFORNIA STRONGLY DISAPPROVE OF THIS AND URGE PHONE OUT. UNTIL THE DEBT IS FULLY PAID THANK YOU. GOOD CITIZEN THE ARGENEAU VOTE UNTIL THE DEBT IS COMPLETELY PAID. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OPPOSITIONAL BRING BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR MOTIONS ARE SECONDS YEAH VENTURE [inaudible] SO. YEAH I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT WE HAD THE BILL -- THE STATUTORY CHANGE EARLIER IN THIS COMMITTEE -- YEAH I WANNA SAY THIS FIRST OF ALL I BELIEVE IN REDEMPTION 100% I BELIEVE IN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. INCARCERATED. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE BIGGEST THING THAT HELPED THAT FAMILY MEMBER WHEN HE GOT OUT WAS GAIN A GOOD JOB. A PRODUCTIVE JOB WASN'T A THE HIGHEST PAYING JOB BUT IT WAS A STAR -- AND HAVING GOOD POSITIVE PEOPLE AROUND HIM AND A FAMILY STRUCTURE TO HELP SUPPORT HIM -- THOSE WERE THE THINGS THAT HELPED HIM GET BACK INTO A PRODUCTIVE LIFESTYLE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I CAN TELL YOU WANT THEN THE THING THAT HE NEVER BROUGHT UP WAS. HEY I NEED TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE RIGHT NOW IN AS AS A PEARLY. NEVER -- AND YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE TALKED TO A TALK TO HIM ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW -- SO. BUT THOSE ARE THE TYPE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RESTORED I WANT TO SAY THIS ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BECAUSE IT GETS USED A LOT AROUND HERE. BUT THERE'S THINGS THAT ACTUALLY WORK -- AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT HAVING SUPPORT OF STRUCTURES HAVING THE ABILITY FOR EMPLOYMENT -- IN THESE ARE THINGS THAT THE STATE OF TEXAS ACTUALLY HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF OF STARTING WITH PEOPLE WHILE THEY ARE IN INCARCERATED. BUILDING JOB SKILLS AND THEN HAVING A JOB THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO INTO ONCE YOU GET OUT [inaudible] A PRISON. RIGHT OF OF HAVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUR KIDS WHILE YOU'RE INCARCERATED. SO YOU CAN BE A GOOD FATHER THEM BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT FATHER HOME. WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT REALLY MAKES? IT REALLY HELP RESTORE SOMEONE'S LIFE AND GET HIM BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT I SEE MOSTLY IS A LOT OF NO ACCOUNTABILITY. AND JUST LET PEOPLE OUT WITHOUT THAT. LET PEOPLE NOT SERVE THEIR FULL SENTENCES. RESTORE RESTORE BENEFITS WITHOUT HAVING THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. ONE OH NINE HAS DONE THAT WE'VE ESSENTIALLY JUST WASHED OUR HANDS IT'S AN PRIMARILY NOT BECAUSE WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE PEOPLE THERE INCARCERATED BUT BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE TO HOUSE THEM IN STATE PRISON. AND BECAUSE WE HAVE LAWSUITS AND WE BASICALLY JUST WASH THEIR HANDS AND SAID GO ON OUT HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T VICTIMIZE PEOPLE AGAIN. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE SO DON'T CALL THAT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE YOU KNOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT REALLY HELP PEOPLE. GET BACK ON A PRODUCTIVE TRACK I HAVE. YOU HAVE A POWERFUL STORY SIR IN AND WHAT I HEARD IT LAST TIME IT TOUCH ME IT REALLY DOES AND I WANT YOU. TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DEMOCRACY -- BUT YOU DO HAVE TO FINISH. YOUR FULL TERM AND I THINK POLL IS PART OF THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS RULE. IN PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT RESIDENT RECIDIVISM -- BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID -- THIS HELPS REDUCE RECIDIVISM RATES THE ONLY THING AND THEY POINT TO AS FLORIDA. AND IN THAT CASE FLORIDA HAD A PROCESS WHERE YOU HAD TO PETITION THE GOVERNOR TO GET YOUR VOTING RIGHTS RESTORED. AND OUT OF THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT PETITIONED. ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE ACTUALLY GOT THEIR RIGHTS RESTORED AND THEY ESSENTIALLY RESTORED RISE TO PEOPLE WHO HAD A LOWER. RISK OF BEING OF OF RE OFFENDING. AND SO THAT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD. PULLED TO TAKE FROM AND SAY HEY THAT THAT'S PROOF THAT IT REDUCES RECIDIVISM RATES. AND THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY STUDY THAT'S BEEN POINTED TO AS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THIS FOR RESTORATION. WITHOUT A PETITION ANYBODY AND SO. LOOK I DON'T WE DON'T. I SEE I I FEEL LIKE WE A LITTLE BIT UNDERSCORE THIS BECAUSE VERY POWERFUL STORY AGAIN I BELIEVE. IN THE ABILITY TO GET. YOUR RIGHTS BACK AND TO GET BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AFTER YOU'VE COMPLETED PAROLE -- BUT LET'S NOT UNDERSCORE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THESE ARE FELONIES OKAY THAT INCLUDES MURDER THAT INCLUDES RAPE THAT INCLUDES SERIOUS ASSAULTS ON PEOPLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. OKAY AND SO LET'S NOT UNDERSCORE IN THE CASE OF MURDER THAT PERSON NEVER GETS TO VOTE AGAIN THEY'RE GONE. WE DON'T SEE THEM AGAIN THEY DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DEMOCRACY. THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE WHOEVER THE OFFENDER WAS. VIOLATED THEIR RIGHTS VIOLATED OUR LAWS SHOWED NO RESPECT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY IN OUR IN THE RULE OF LAW. IN VIOLATED THE LAW THEY DID DO THAT. OKAY SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN RAPED THEY HAVE THAT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE. DOESN'T GO AWAY. SO THOSE VICTIMS HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS STUFF THE REST OF THEIR LIFE AND AND US REQUIRING YOU. TO REQUIRING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WHO HAVE COMMITTED THOSE CRIMES. TO BE ACCOUNTABLE AND PAY A SENSE FOR THAT AND AND WHILE YOU'RE PAYING THAT SENTENCE. THAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE TAKEN AWAY. SEEMS TO ME TO BE PRETTY REASONABLE CONSIDERING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIMES THAT IMMIGRATED. IN THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVEN'T PRAYED PLACE TODAY. TO ME SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY REASONABLE. ONE YOU PAY YOUR SENTENCE. YOU RELEASED ON PAROLE IT'S A CONDITIONAL RE RELEASE IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN OR SENTENCES OVER. YOU'VE BEEN RELEASED ON PAROLE EARLY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'VE BEEN RELEASED ON PAROLE YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED YOUR FULL SENTENCE A BODY HAS DECIDED WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE YOU INTO SIT SIT INTO SOCIETY BEFORE YOUR SENTENCE IS COMPLETE. ON CONDITION ON CONDITIONS. AND WE'RE SAYING HEY IF YOU CAN MEET THESE CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO DO THAT THEN YOU'RE FINALLY RELEASED FROM PAROLE AND YOU ARE FULLY FREE CITIZEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH YOUR PAROLE OFFICER. YOU KNOW -- THAT'S NOT FREEDOM SHOULD WE SAY HEY YOU SHOULD NOT TO REPORT YOUR PRO OFFICER. I MEAN NOW WE HAVE THESE CONDITIONS IN PLACE FOR A REASON. AND WHEN YOUR SENSES COMPLETE THEN YOU CAN HAVE YOUR RIGHTS RESTORED AND YOU CAN BE PART OF THIS DEMOCRACY AND I WANT YOU TO BE PART OF THIS DEMOCRACY THING I'M GLAD YOU HAVE THAT DESIRE. I JUST BUT I JUST I DON'T WANT IT SEEMS LIKE WE STE WE SORT OF UNDERSCORE THIS IS NO BIG DEAL AND THAT WE SHOULD JUST ARE OBVIOUSLY WE SHOULD DO THIS. AND THERE'S SOME VERY GOOD PUBLIC POLICY REASONS FOR NOT DOING I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO EARN YOUR WAY BACK TO EARN YOUR WAY BACK TO TRUST. INTO FULL RESTORATION OF YOUR RIGHTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW AND THAT AND THAT IS REALLY TO ME THE CRUX OF THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER MSS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- JUST GOING THROUGH AND READING SOME OF THE THE ANALYSIS ON THIS THIS BILL AND SO IT SEEMS. THAT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY -- THERE'S SORT OF A MIXED BAG -- BUT LOOKS LIKE. AND BOTH MAINE AND VERMONT -- THERE IS -- THE WHETHER YOU'RE INCARCERATED OR NOT YOU STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO BUT VOTE CORRECT -- AND THEN IT LOOKS LIKE -- THAT IN TWENTY TWO STATES FELONS WHO THEY'RE VOTING RIGHTS DURING INCARCERATION FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THAT TYPICALLY WHILE ON PRO A PAROLE OR PROBATION. I STRUGGLE LITTLE BIT WITH THIS ALL UP I'LL TELL YA BECAUSE I DO ALSO BELIEVE IN -- WRIT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE -- AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS FROM A LOGICAL PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK ABOUT. WHAT WHAT IS THE RIGHT TO VOTE ACTUALLY MEANS AND THE GENTLEMAN WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT WE ARE REPUBLICAN NOT A DEMOCRACY I THINK WE HAVE TO WE CAN'T FORGET THAT A REPUBLIC IS ACTUALLY? A FORM OF OF OF OF DEMOCRACY -- THE BUT IT IS STILL A DEMOCRACY -- THE YOU CAN'T FORGET THAT A SORT OF THE CORE FOUNDING OF OUR OF OUR CONSTITUTION IS YOU KNOW WE THE PEOPLE -- AND IT IS -- WE THE PEOPLE -- THAT ULTIMATELY ARE ARE THE DECIDER -- THIS QUESTION THAT COMES BEFORE US -- IS ONE THAT HAS TO BE ANSWERED CONSTITUTIONALLY A BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA -- IT SAYS THAT -- IF YOU'RE ON PAROLED YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO TO VOTE. BUT YOU'RE ALSO THOUGH -- IF YOU'RE ON PROBATION YOU ARE RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW NOT SURE EXACTLY BECAUSE I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY AND I'M NOT IN A CRIMINAL LAW BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROBATION AND AND AND AND PAROLE OF MAYBE ONE OF YOU GUYS WANT TO ADDRESS THAT. THE THE THE END THE BILL BEFORE US DUMB. IS NOT A VOTE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO OF THOSE WHO ARE ON PAROLE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE. THE BILL BEFORE US IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WILL ALLOW THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION -- AND FOR THAT REASON I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS -- EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHEN IT COMES BEFORE ME AT THE BALLOT -- HOW I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO VOTE I WOULD LEAN TOWARDS TOWARDS YES BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE YET BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE I THINK THAT BECAUSE THIS QUESTION -- IS IS A MIXED BAG ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I THINK THAT THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE IS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE AT SOME MOMENT IN TIME IN HISTORY. ANY LEGISLATURE CAN DECIDE VARIOUS THINGS -- ARE ILLEGAL AND YOU CAN HAVE TO SERVE A PRISON SENTENCE AND A STRIP YOU OF THAT ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO TO VOTE AND NOT HAVE A VOICE IN YOUR DEMOCRACY -- IS -- IS IS TOO MUCH FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TO GIVE AWAY I THINK THIS QUESTION I'M SHOULD GO BEFORE OF THE VOTERS -- AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. YOU MUST MAYES. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DR EMOTION OR SECOND WITH THE BILL I HAVE A MOTION I HAVE A SECOND -- ANY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SURE THANK YOU AT THAT'S ONE TO RESPOND A COUPLE ISSUES BUT FIRST I WANT TO THANK. THE CO AUTHORS OF THIS MEASURE TO WHICH ARE ON THIS COMMITTEE MISTER MULLIN. AND AND DOCTOR WEBER AND I THINK SOMEONE OR MAKE MAYES NAILED IT THAT WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF OPINIONS I HAVE AN OPINION. OUR VICE CHAIR AS AN OPINION ON THE PUBLIC HAVE AN OPINION WE'RE NOT DECIDING WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY WE'RE DECIDING TO PUT IT ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE THE STATE CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. CAN'T MAKE THIS CHANGE WE HAVE TO GO BEFORE THE ELECTORATE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ASK THAT THE PUBLIC A WEIGH IN. ON THAT ON THIS ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT COURSE TO DO AT THIS IS THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE NOT THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. I'M NOT A PUBLIC SAFETY EXPERT EITHER BY THINK WANT TO CLARIFY ONE THING ABOUT PEARL -- PAROLE. IS IS NOT PUNISHMENT. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PAROLED HAD BEEN DEEMED BY THE PAROLE BOARD THAT THEY IF THEY'RE SAFE TO RETURN TO SOCIETY THEY SERVE A NOT FOR THEIR PRISON SENTENCE. TO TO WARRANT THE PUNISHMENT THAT WAS BROUGHT UPON THEM BY THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM A PAROLE IS ABOUT RE INTEGRATING AND SUPPORTING PEOPLE BACK INTO SOCIETY AS YOU THINK ABOUT THAT DEFINITION OF PAROLE. THIS FITS PERFECTLY WITH THAT A RE INTEGRATING INDIVIDUALS BACK INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY AND SO I WITH THAT I I I AND MANY OTHERS THINK THIS IS THE MORALLY RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT THIS ALSO IS -- IS A SMART THING TO DO FOR SALE CALIFORNIA WITH THAT ASK THE RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- THIS MCCARTY. SO A CA SIX OFFERS ON I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THE CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT FORD AND I I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES AND AND THE PUBLIC FOR THE COMMENTS AND CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD TODAY -- THIS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE PEOPLE ARE GONNA FALL ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF IT -- YOU KNOW PAROLE IS IS A PART OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS AND AND WHEN YOU RELEASED ON PAROLE YOU GET. CERTAIN RIGHTS BACK AND IT'S PERFECTLY JUSTIFIABLE FOR US TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND FOR THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER OR NOT THE RIGHT TO VOTE SHOULD BE ONE OF THOSE RIGHTS THAT YOU GET. BACK -- WHEN YOU'RE RELEASED ON PAROLE -- I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR THE STATE TO HAVE I THINK IT'S GREAT. THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA VOTERS SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO HAVE A SAY IN THAT AND AND MAKE THEIR VOICE HEARD AND THEN WE'LL FOLLOW WHATEVER THE WILL OF THE VOTERS ARE AND THAT'S A MARKER SEE. SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE ACA TODAY. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS BE ADOPTED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI BERMAN I'D GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CALDERON. CALDERON AYE LOW. WELL I MAYES. MAYES AYE MULLIN. MULLIN AYE WEBER. SO THAT. THE BILL HAS A FIVE TO ONE VOTE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. AT BUT IT PASSED THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU -- AND NOW I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR AUTHORS. SO IF ANYBODY'S WATCHING ON TV. COME ON DOWN TO THE NEXT CONTESTANT. IN ROOM -- FOUR FOUR FOUR IT BUT WE DO HAVE -- AUTHOR BILLS SO WHY DON'T WE GO IN ORDER. ALWAYS A CA -- FOR OUR NUMBER ONE CUSTOMER MULLIN IF YOU LIKE YOU I AM GOING TO HAND THE GAVEL OVER THE VICE CHAIR AND GO PRESENT A COUPLE OF BILLS AND SENATE EDUCATION. THE BE GOOD THAT WOULD BE STRATEGIC. RIGHT MISTER MON YOU HAVE ITEM NUMBER ONE ACA. FOR THANK YOU. BYE SHARE MEMBERS VOTER TURNOUT IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS IS CONSISTENTLY LOWER. THAT OBSERVE TURNOUT LEVELS FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS. ACCORDING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE APPROXIMATELY 50% OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS PARTICIPATED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN GENERAL ELECTION. WHILE ONLY TWENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR THREE PART PERCENT PARTICIPATED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PRIMARY ELECTION. RESEARCH ALSO INDICATES THAT THE YOUTH POPULATION HAS THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUT. OUT OF ANY AGE DEMOGRAPHIC THE TURNOUT FOR ELIGIBLE YOUTH VOTERS WAS ONLY TWENTY SEVEN POINT 5% FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN GENERAL ELECTION IN OUR STATE. ACA. FOR WOULD CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE FIRST TIME VOTERS AND BOOST THE YOUTH VOTER TURNOUT. BY ALLOWING SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO VOTE IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION PROVIDED THAT THEY WILL BE EIGHTEEN BY THE TIME OF THE GENERAL ELECTION. STUDIES SHOW THAT VOTING IS HABIT FORMING ONCE A PERSON VOTES HERE SHE IS MORE LIKELY TO DO SO AGAIN. EARLY INVOLVEMENT IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS FOR FIRST TIME VOTERS SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THIS REASON. ACA FOR WOULD LAY THE FOUNDATION TO BUILD THE VOTING HAVE IT AT AN EARLY AGE ALLOWING SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO PARTICIPATE IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS. WOULD COMPLEMENT THE CIVIC EDUCATION MANY RECEIVE IN HIGH SCHOOL INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE STUDENTS BECOME A LIFE LONG VOTERS. THE IDEA IS NOT A NEW ONE NEARLY HALF OF STATES IN THE U. S. ALREADY ALLOW SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO PARTICIPATE. IN PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES FIRST TIME VOTERS SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT FULL ELECTION CYCLE WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ON STRONG LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL FOOTING WITH THIS APPROACH LINKING THE PRIMARY. WITH THE GENERAL WITH ME TODAY TO OFFER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS IN SUPPORT. IT'S BEEN HERE. OKAY MANY WERE MANY ROMERO DOCTOR MINDY ROMERO I BELIEVE IS IN ROUTE -- SHE IS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROJECT BASED AT USC HI THERE. AND WE ALSO HAVE TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. NAOMI PIPER PAL AND ELLA YET SAKE TO PROVIDE THE YOUTH PERSPECTIVE. OKAY. WITNESSES A POOR GO AHEAD -- HI MY NAME'S AMY PIPER PAL AND I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC -- I AM A STUDENT IN THE REAR AMERICAN OF SABOTAGE PROGRAM WHICH IS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE YOUTH COMMISSION. AND AS A STUDENTS OF TOSSED ICE STUDY THE POLITICAL PROCESS CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND POLITICAL SCIENCE I'M GLAD I CAN BE HERE TODAY TO APPLY THE SKILLS KNOWLEDGE I'VE LEARNED IN THAT PROGRAM TO PROMOTE YOUTH CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. THE LAST FEW YEARS YOUNG PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF NOT YET OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE HAVE BECOME ACTIVE IN THE POLITICAL SCENE. IF LOBBIED IN TESTIFIED ON CRITICAL ISSUES INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE HEALTH CARE GUN CONTROL IN COLLEGE AT THE MILLIONS AMERICAN YOUTH HAVE COME TOGETHER TO INFLUENCE THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE. MANY ARE RESTRICTED FROM FOR PARTICIPATING IN OUR DEMOCRACY. THE MARCH FOR OUR LIVES TO CON ANTI GUN CONTROL POLITICIANS IN ORGANIZATIONS OF MANY OF THE YOUNG ORGANIZER'S AND SPEAKERS WERE UNABLE TO TAKE THE POLICE TO THE BALLOT BOX. IN RESPONSE MANY STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA HAVE PROPOSED LOWERING THE VOTING AGE TO SEVENTEEN OR EVEN SIXTEEN WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF ASSEMBLY A CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT. FOR CALIFORNIA COULD JOIN A GROWING LIST OF STATES THAT ALLOW SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WILL BE EIGHTEEN BY THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION. IN PRIMARIES IN SPECIAL ELECTIONS TWENTY THREE STATES THAT SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS CAN VOTE IN PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES WHETHER THE STATE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN OR SWING THE STATE LEGISLATURES UNDERSTAND VOTING. YOUNG HELPS FORM A LIFELONG HABIT CORNER FAIRVOTE DOT ORG QUOTE THIS POLICY INCREASES YOU THINK AGE MEN IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS BY CREATING AN ETHOS OF PARTICIPATION FROM YOUNGER AGE. WHAT'S A PERSON VOTES THAT PERSON IS LIKELY TO VOTE AGAIN. FOR THE MORE AGE SEVENTEEN MANY STUDENTS ARE IN THE MIDST OF STUDYING GOVERNMENTS THEY CAN APPLY WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS IN THE VOTING BOOTH. WE MUST IMPAIR THE NEXT GENERATION OF VOTERS FROM POLITICAL BATTLES THAT LIE AHEAD AND GIVEN THE POWER OF THE VOTE. CALIFORNIA USERS ON THE MOST ENGAGE IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE. PASSAGE OF ACA FOR WOULD BE A GIANT STEP TOWARDS INCREASING YOUTH CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND CURRENT EVENTS AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. HELLO MY NAME IS ELLIOTT SAKE AND I'M A RISING HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO. THIS SUMMER I'M WORKING AS AN INTERN FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU AND CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE SPEAR. I'VE ALSO WORKED AS AN AS AN ELECTIONS AMBASSADOR WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF ELECTIONS -- SO I WAS FIRST INTRODUCED TO POLITICS IN FIFTH GRADE -- THE TWENTY TWELVE ELECTION WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION I COULD ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND I WAS COMPLETELY ADDICTED TO EVERYTHING ABOUT IT I WAS ADDICTED TO THE DEBATES. THE CAMPAIGN SPEECHES IN THE NEWS ABOUT THE CANDIDATES. ONE TWENTY SIXTEEN ROLLED AROUND MY LOVE FOR POLITICS ONLY INCREASED THIS TIME I WASN'T JUST WATCHING I WAS FORMING MY OWN OPINIONS ON POLITICS. I WASN'T JUST HEARING CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT THE FORD WILL CARE ACT I WAS FORMING MY OWN STANCE ON IT. I WASN'T JUST LISTENING TO CANDIDATES DEBATE THE PLANTS TACKLE IMMIGRATION I WAS GETTING MY OWN PLANTS. I REACH THIS LEVEL OF INTEREST IN POLITICS I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET THE CHANCE TO PROPEL MY CIVIC DUTY ABOUT. I ASSUME AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY I WOULD GET TO VOTE IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WOULD BE IN THE PRIMARY. I ASSUME THIS I SEND OUT BECAUSE I WILL BE EIGHTEEN BY THE GENERAL ELECTION. I WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY I WAS WRONG. SINCE EIGHTH GRADE I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE CONNECTING WITH LEGISLATORS ON IT AND CHATTING WITH DOZENS OF MY OWN FRIENDS ABOUT HOW THIS ISSUE AFFECTS SO MANY OF US. I WAS ABLE TO LEARN THAT AROUND HALF THE COUNTRY IS ALREADY PASSED THIS INTO LAW THAT FEW LEGISLATORS OPPOSE IT AND THAT MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND CLASSMATES ARE JUST AS FRUSTRATED AS I AM ABOUT IT. NOW IS A RISING SENIOR I HOPE THAT STUDENTS AFTER ME WILL GET THE CHANCE TO VOTE IN THE PRIMARY REGARDLESS OF THE SPECIFIC MONTH AIRBORNE AND WE AS A STATE SHOULD ALWAYS ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO VOTE ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE. IN ORDER TO INSTILL THE VALUE OF VOTING IN THE NEXT GENERATION WE MUST ALLOW THEM TO HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO LET THEIR VOICES BE HEARD. THIS IS WHY I ALONG WITH MANY OTHER STUDENTS ARE FIGHTING FOR AC. FOUR WE'RE NOT FIGHTING TO CHANGE THE VOTING AGE PER SE BUT RATHER TO ADJUST THE VOTING SYSTEM TO BE MORE FAIR AND COMPREHENSIVE FOR STATE'S NEWEST MOTORS. THANK YOU. WELL I DON'T KNOW WHEN I CAN REALLY ADD BEYOND THAT. YOU BOTH THAT AT ALL AND THE WELL I'M SO I MEAN YOU REMEMBER ON THE DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA THAT THEY CAN GET YOUR PROJECT AND NOW YOU WITH THE IN SACRAMENTO -- I THINK WHAT ALL ADDED FIRST OF ALL AT THE OUT THAT SAY THAT -- MY RESEARCH CENTER WE DON'T FORMALLY TAKE POSITIONS ON BILLS BUT I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE RESEARCH IN THE FIELD ARE RESEARCH. I SAID THAT -- ON THIS TOPIC IN IN IN IN WITH THE HELP THAT'LL HELP INFORM YOUR DECISIONS TODAY. SO -- YOU'VE HEARD THE NUMBERS THE STATE OF CIVIC -- ACTUALLY VOTER PARTICIPATION SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IS LOW I WILL GO OVER THOSE AGAIN BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT. THERE ARE THERE ARE WAYS TO REMEDY THAT -- A KEY PREDICTOR KEY SOLUTION TO GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE HELPING THEM TO TO PARTICIPATE. IS TO HELP HEM MAKE THAT CONNECTION TO WHY VOTING MATTERS TO FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR LIVES THEIR COMMUNITIES. MY THE ACTUAL ACT OF VOTING WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT REALLY IS WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS RIGHT WITH ISSUE WHEN YOU'RE COMPLETELY NEW TO THE TO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. AND SO -- RESEARCHED AS SUGGESTED NOT DIRECTLY LEAST INDIRECTLY THAT -- A BILL LIKE A CA FOR VOTING IN THE PRIMARY -- CAN HELP MAKE THAT CONNECTION. RIGHT SO IT FOR ALL THE REASONS OVER THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED -- BOTH IN THE PRIMARY BUT IN THE GENERAL WHEN YOU KNOW VOTING IN GENERAL WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE HAD -- A SE -- AND THERE IS BY AND AND IN THAT INCOMPLETE ELECTION CYCLE CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. ALSO. AS LONG AS THERE ARE PROPERLY IDENTIFIED -- AS AS THE ELIGIBLE VOTERS IN THAT PRIMARY ROUTE WE CAN ASSUME THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET CONTACTED BY CANDIDATES AND GET CAMPAIGN MATERIALS AND THAT'LL REALLY MATTERS BECAUSE SPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE. GAINING FAMILIARITY WITH THE PROCESS. MAYBE THE FIRST TIME MAYBE IT THE SECOND TIME YOU GET THOSE MATERIALS AND YOU GET THAT CONTACT IS OUT WHICH IS ALWAYS VERY VERY LOW TO YOUNG PEOPLE -- BACK ALSO CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO MAKING IT FAMILY AND ALSO JUST REMIND THEM THAT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IS IMPORTANT. LASTLY ALL ADD. I IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY THE LAW IS PRE REGISTRATION OF SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS RIGHT AS YOU ALL KNOW. AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL POTENTIAL HERE THAT THIS LAW COULD SUPPORT BE KEY SUPPORT. TO PRE REGISTRATION EFFORTS SO IT'S ALREADY BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL HUNDRED THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PRINTER SECRETARY STATE OF YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT HAVE REGISTERED -- BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE STILL IS THE QUESTION. BY THE TIME THEY TURN EIGHTEEN I WILL THEY WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE STILL MOTIVATED AND THAT THERE THAT TO PARTICIPATE THAT THEIR WHERE REMEMBER THAT THEY WERE REGISTERED. AND POTENTIALLY VOTING IN THAT PRIMARY COULDBE A KEY CONNECTOR IF YOU WILL -- AND BE AN ADDITIONAL MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR VOTING BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY FOR REGISTERING -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN OF MAYBE REGISTER JUST BEFORE THE PRIMARY RIGHT INTO BECAUSE YOU'RE ELIGIBLE OR SOMEWHERE NEAR AROUND THAT PRIMARY. SO -- I THINK THERE'S A REAL POSSIBILITY HERE NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF INCREASING. POTENTIAL INCREASING PROTECT. JUST ABOUT PARTICIPATION IN VOTER TURNOUT LEVELS BUT ALSO JUST MAKING THE VOTING PROCESS MORE SALIENT VOTING IS HABIT FORMING WE WANT TO MAKE THAT A SOLID RELEVANT. PROCESS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY -- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING KAELIN DEAN WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AND POLICY LINK IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR A CA. FOR DOOR ROSALIE GIVEN VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT. ALEX BEFORE WITH THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. CITY WHEREVER SACRAMENTO IT IS INDIVIDUAL AND SUPPORT IN REGISTERED SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS LATELY FOR YEARS SO LONG AS IT'S NO GENERAL ELECTION. JOHN RIEGER STATE CHAIR FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY OUR PARTY HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS BUT WE'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED YOUNGER VOTERS. AND I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF URGING YOU TO SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU. ANY. FOLKS IN OPPOSITION. MY NAME'S GREG GALLON I'M IN OPPOSITION OF CHILDREN VOTING. WHO DON'T HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RENT FOOD? AND PAYING TAXES. ROLL RODRIGUEZ AMERICA FIRST LATINO COORDINATOR FOR CALIFORNIA. IN OPPOSITION. THESE ARE IN MATURE [inaudible] STUDENTS YOUNG. INDIVIDUALS THAT DON'T. HAVE ANY ABILITY TO VOTE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW. WHAT THEY SHOULD BE VOTING POWER? THANK YOU. I'M OPPOSED I UNDERSTAND THESE WOMEN ARE THESE YOUNG WOMEN HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES VERY WELL BUT THEY HAVE LEARNED HOW TO VOTE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND LESS THE TEACHERS AREN'T DOING THEIR JOB. SO NAY NO -- CAN I GO UP TO THE TAPE YEAH YOU CAN YOU CAN APPROACH IF. AGAIN MY NAME IS A COALING BRITAIN I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. AND WE OPPOSE BOTH A CA FOR AN A. C. A.. EIGHT ACA FOR SIX TO ALLOW SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO CAST A VOTE IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION IF THEY WILL BE EIGHTEEN BY THE FOLLOWING GENERAL ELECTION. ACA BUT ALLOW SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO VOTE PERIOD. OF THEY ARE LEGALLY MINORS OF ADD TO THAT TO THE FACT THAT OF THAT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS IN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATING. BY NOVEMBER OF OKAY LET ME START OVER AGAIN I LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN HERE. OKAY A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD OUR LEGAL MINORS AND THAT DEFINITION AND THEY ARE STILL CONSIDERED CHILDREN. THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS STILL LIVING AT HOME WITH UNDER THE STRONG INFLUENCE OF THEIR PARENTS AND THIS IS NOT CONDUCTIVE TO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT. AND VOTING WITHOUT UNDUE PRESSURE FROM THEIR IMMEDIATE SUPERIORS. SITUATION IS EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT OVER 75% OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE VOTING WITH MAIL IN BALLOTS. AND THAT THE SAME PERCENTAGE WOULD LOGICALLY APPLY TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WOULD BE VOTERS. THEREFORE THESE CHILDREN WITH THE MAKING THEIR BALLOTS AT MARKING YOUR BALLOTS AND HOME WHAT PLATE PROBABLY UNDER THE DIRECT ASSISTANCE OF ADULTS. AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THEY WOULD BE GUARANTEED. AND THAT WOULD NOT BE GUARANTEED THE FREEDOM TO VOTE INDEPENDENTLY AND EXPRESS THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE. THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WILL ALMOST ALWAYS BE A STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND UNDER STRONG INFLUENCE OF THEIR TEACHERS. THIS WILL AGAIN MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT THEY WOULD BE EXPRESSING THEIR OWN INDEPENDENTLY THOUGHT OUT CHOICES. THAT THEY WILL. BE ALLOWED TO VOTE. NOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MOVED ITS PRIMARY DATE TO EARLY MARCH THERE ARE EIGHT MONTHS BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND THE GENERAL ELECTION. CONSIDERING MATURATION THAT CAN BE PLACED CAN TAKE PLACE IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME FOR PEOPLE IN THEIR LATE TEENS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD CAN BE ASTONISHING ANY PARENT OF A HIGH SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER CAN VERIFY THAT TRUTH. ADDING TO THE STRING OF OPPOSITION TO A CA. FOR ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS WILL ALMOST ALWAYS BE IN HIGH SCHOOL THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES BY THE BY NOVEMBER. EITHER BEGINNING THEIR TWO TO EARN THEIR WAY IN THE WORLD ARE BEGINNING TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE CAREER BI VOCATIONAL TRAINING OR ENROLLMENT IN AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING. THIS ENTRANCE INTO REAL LIFE CREATES A SOBERING AND MATURING AFFECT THAT SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WILL NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED. MOST WILL SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY MORE RESPONSIBLY AND WILL FEEL MORE EXPERIENCED. MOST WILL SEE THE WORLD OF OKAY WHAT MORE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN LIVES AND THEIR POLITICAL DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEM. ONLY WHEN PEOPLE REACH THAT STAGE CAN NAY CAST AN EDUCATED VOTE. THERE ARE NO LEGITIMATE REASONS TO EXTEND THE VOTING RIGHT TO LEGALLY TO MINORS AND MANY SCIENTIFIC AND LOGICAL REGION'S REASONS NOT. TO I WOULD LIKE TO ADD A COUPLE PERSONAL THOUGHTS OF I REGISTERED TO VOTE. OF IN THE DAYS OF THE ALBATROSS WHEN I WAS. TWENTY ONE THAT WAS THE VOTING AGE THEN -- DURING THE VIETNAM WAR THEY LOWERED THE VOTING AGE. TO EIGHTEEN AND THE REASON FOR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS THAT WERE DRAFTED INTO THE ARMY -- M. WERE RISKING THEIR LIFE AND LIMB FOR OUR COUNTRY SO OF COURSE THEY THEY DESERVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AFTER THE WAR THAT THAT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD AGE SO STOOD. BUT NAY EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS NOW ARE MOSTLY LIVING AT HOME THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL THEY'RE NOT EARNING A LIVING. PAYING TAXES AND AND ASSIDUOUS FULL CITIZENSHIP SO I'VE I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE TO GO EVEN LOWER AND WE JUST RECENTLY. OF RAISE THE AGE FROM. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE FOUR OF THE PURCHASE OF TOBACCO AN OF LIQUOR AND OTHER THINGS SO I I YOU KNOW WE'RE SAYING WE'RE SAYING TWO DIFFERENT THINGS HERE. ARE THEY ARE THEY OF RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO TO VOTE OR THEY WOULD NOT IT RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO TAKE. OF CARE OF THEIR YOU KNOW OF PURCHASES OF TOBACCO AND THINGS SO I JUST YOU KNOW WE JUST WEIRD. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SUB THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM -- ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION JUST NAME AND AND POSITION AND OUT AND WATCH THAT YOU'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. YES MY NAME STAFF COMPANION EVERYTHING THE CALLING JOE SAYS. I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH. WHERE WE LIVE IN A STATE? WHERE THEY DON'T WANT CHILDREN?

WE'VE ALREADY DONE TESTIMONY FROM BOTH SIDES SO NOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET UP YOU TO STATE YOUR NAME AND THAT YOU'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL OKAY. ROBIN VETS DONE THE REMEMBRANCE PROJECT ORIGINAL VOTE. PATRICE LINE'S PARENT HIGHER GENOVA. STELLAR MAY STRONGLY. OF AGREE WITH ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CAN STRONGLY OPPOSE SO VOTE NO PLACE. TIM MCMANUS STRONG OPPOSITION. QUINN MIRED IN STRONG OPPOSITION. LEE MEANT TO BURY A RESOUNDING NO. AVERAGE CITIZEN JUST SAY NO. OKAY. OF SCENE OF FURTHER OPPOSITION -- BRING IT BACK COMMITTEE QUESTIONS -- YES MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER MALL AND FOR AUTHORING THIS A CA I WANNA THINK STUDENTS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK YOUR PROFESSED TO WHY YOU'RE CAPABLE OF DOING THIS. AND I REALLY IT REALLY FRUSTRATES ME WHEN I HEAR ARGUMENTS THAT WE'RE BECAUSE OF OUR AGE BECAUSE OF YOU BEING YOUNG YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF MAKING A DECISION. LIKE THIS IT IS -- AN ACCURATE -- YOU KNOW. I HEN I GOT WHEN I DECIDED RUN FOR OFFICE I WAS -- TWENTY FIVE WHEN I START MY CAMPAIGN I GOT ELECTED JUST AFTER I TURNED TWENTY SEVEN AS A PERSONAL ANY OVER LIKE TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE. APPARENTLY ONLINE I WAS. ABOUT MY OWN HISTORY. I WAS THE FIRST MILLENNIAL EVER ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS YOUNG AS MAJORITY LEADER IN HISTORY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN THEN WHEN I RAN ICE I RECEIVED THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT I WAS TOO YOUNG AND CAPABLE OF SERVING IN THE POSITION. THAT I AM IN BUT YET THAT HASN'T STOPPED ME FROM CONTINUING TO BE REELECTED NOW SERVING. IN MY SEVENTH YEAR IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE I GREW UP WITH A FAMILY THAT WAS POLITICALLY ACTIVE IT WAS. AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO REGISTER TO VOTE I VOTED IN EVERY SINGLE ELECTION EVER SINCE THEN AND IT HAS MOTIVATED TO STAY ENGAGED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D EVER RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE BUT THE MORE I LEARN THE MORE I WAS ENGAGED TO MORE AYE VOTE IN. THE MORE I KNEW THAT MY PERSPECTIVE IN MY GENERATIONS VIEW WAS NOT BEING REPRESENTED IN GOVERNMENT AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT. LACK OF PARTICIPATION BY OUR GENERATION IS THE REASON WHY WE'RE IN REALLY IN MY OPINION SUCH A TERRIBLE POSITION TODAY LOOK AT OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S A DISASTER AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER. AND IT ISN'T AND IT ISN'T BECAUSE OF ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE JUST BEEN THERE FOR TOO LONG AND THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT MATTER THEY'RE THE ONLY VOICES THAT MATTER. WHEN WE'RE GENERATION AS COSTLY BEEN TOLD YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT SMART ENOUGH YOU CAN PARTICIPATE YOU JUST LISTENING TO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD? AND I DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK THAT THAT IS WHY WE ARE SUCH AN IN SUCH A TOUGH PLACE AS A COUNTRY THE ONLY WORK WAY WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THAT. AND RECTIFY THE RECTIFY THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN THIS COUNTRY IS BY HAVING A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE NEXT GENERATION THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA BE FORCED TO LIVE UNDER THAT THE POLICIES. THAT ARE BEING PASSED TODAY BECAUSE WE ON THOUGH IN THIS BUILDING. THE ONLY PASS SOMETHING THE IMPACT IS AND ALWAYS IMMEDIATE THE IMPACT THIS FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS DOWN THE THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A VOICE. IN THAT AND THE IDEA THAT WE DON'T PAY TAXES APPARENTLY FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE WORKING ALL THE TIME AND AGAIN THE PERMISSIVE SCHOOL AGAIN -- OKAY BY THE MOTHER THAT THEIR PARENTS IN ORDER TO WORK ACTUALLY NO. FIFTEEN A SIX YEAR OLDS ARE WORKING THEY'RE PAYING PAYROLL TAXES THIS IS WHY YOU'RE TRUMP OR THEY'RE PAYING PAYROLL TAXES. AND THEY'RE PAYING SALES TAXES AND SO THIS IS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE. THIS IS. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THIS IS THIS IS THE BOTTOM. THERE'S ABSOLUTE LONGBOTTOM THE GALLERY FOR OUR COUNTRY AND IT ALL STARTS HERE THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CHANGE IT WAS BY GETTING A NEW PERSPECTIVE FROM A NEW GENERATION. TO GET IN THERE AND VOTE AND SO I AM PROUD TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS I AM PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF ACA. EIGHT AND LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS GETS TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO TO GET PAST THANK YOU RESPECT LAST NIGHT BUT THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON OKAY. WE ALL SAY THINGS IN HERE THAT OUR OPINIONS SOMETIMES WE DON'T LIKE WHAT THE OTHER PERSON IS SAYING WE WE CAN BE UPSET ABOUT THAT BUT WE RESPECT PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO SPEAK. AND SO. EVERYBODY'S BEEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY GIVE TESTIMONY TO GET UP. YOU KNOW AND SO WHEN OTHER MEMBERS ARE GIVING THEIR OPINIONS ON THE BILL. I ASKED YOU GIVE THEM THE THE EQUAL RESPECT THAT EVERYBODY ELSE HERE GAVE. YOU IN THE AUDIENCE AS WELL. MR MAYES. ABOUT WELL THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR -- I MEAN. CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY -- AND BEN ALL GIVE THE REASONS WHY I ACTUALLY WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MISTER CALDERON -- HE WAS -- OUT MUCH MORE TALENTED THAN HI HE GOT ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE AT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SEVEN I WAS ELECTED -- TO THE CITY COUNCIL WHEN I WAS A TWENTY FIVE AND SO I GOT I WAS VERY YOUNG AND VERY ENGAGED IN. THE PROCESS -- EARLY ON ACTUALLY A GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL A MONTH AFTER MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY SKIPPED A COUPLE OF GRADES -- SO I WAS DONE I WAS IN COLLEGE -- AT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AMID FINISHED ON MY FIRST TWO YEARS BEFORE I HAD -- BECOME EIGHTEEN I THINK I HAD WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD I THINK I HAD THE SMARTS -- TO BE ABLE TO A TO VOTE AND YET I WASN'T -- EIGHTEEN THE REASON I'M NOT SUPPORTED THIS TODAY FACT I'VE BEEN DEBATING BACK AND FORTH IN MY IN MY HEAD ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS IDEA OF OF THE PRIMARY AND THE PRIMARY -- KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GOING INTO THE GENERAL -- AND YET I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE -- THAT'S THAT'S THERE BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE BEGINNING TO VOTE IN A IN A PRIMARY AT SEVENTEEN WILL THEN WHY NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THE GENERAL -- AT AT SEVENTEEN AND I THINK I STRUGGLE WITH A LOT OF OUR ARE THESE THE THE THIS QUESTION OF OF THE AGE OF OF MAJORITY -- AND WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO SIGN A CONTRACT AND IT'S LEGALLY BINDING -- WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO GO INTO THE MILITARY -- YOU KNOW WITHIN SAID -- WHEN YOU CAN BUY A PACK OF CIGARETTES? WHEN YOU CAN A DRINK ALCOHOL ALL OF THAT IS AT THE AGE OF? TWENTY ONE I THINK IN THIS COUNTRY WE NEED TO HAVE A A A A A REAL DEBATE ABOUT WHAT IS THE AGE OF MAJORITY I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT AGES -- EIGHTEEN MAYBE IT'S TWENTY ONE BUT YET WE ARE PRETTY SCHIZOPHRENIC AND HOW WE THAT WE WE DECIDE WHEN YOU CAN DO ONE THING OR OR THE OTHER -- AND FOR THAT REASON -- I AM NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS -- THE TODAY -- I THINK EIGHTEEN IS WHAT THE FEDERAL RULES ARE I THINK WE TO BE PRETTY CONSISTENT -- A WITH THAT -- I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME BUT SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS -- SOME FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS -- THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY AND THE THOUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DEVOTE AND YET THEY HAVEN'T YET READ THE REACH THAT AGE DID THAT LEGAL AGE OF OF MAJORITY. AND I THINK UNTIL YOU GET THERE -- I DON'T THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE -- TO TO BE ABLE TO BE OF TO VOTE. HELLO. YES THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAD A QUESTION IF IF I MIGHT GO THROUGH THE CHAIR YEAH -- TO IS IS IT LINDA THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT WELL I'M CALLING BRITAIN THE REPRESENTATIVE OF OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WAS JUST -- I WANTED TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS A WITH RESPECT TO THE LETTER IN YOUR PUBLIC TESTIMONY WITH THE PRESENTS BUT WITH RESPECT TO TAXATION. ABOUT TEENS NOT PAYING TAXES IT WAS THAT WAS THAT PART OF THAT STATEMENT THAT YOU HAD MADE AS WELL. I DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WAS IN OUR STATEMENT. OKAY DO IT THERE I USED TO TEACH A AMERICAN GOVERNMENT DOES THIS NOTION ABOUT AND NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION DO YOU BELIEVE IN THAT SIMILAR KIND OF PHILOSOPHY YES ABSOLUTELY ENDS SINCE -- AT SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS -- ARGUABLY PAY PAYROLL TAXES -- THEY'RE WORKING AT MCDONALDS OR YEAH YEAH JOSH SHARED IMPROPERLY IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BROWN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS. A PAGE FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PAYROLL TAXES A SIMILE SUCH THEY WOULD GO TO FILL UP AT THE PUMP JUST AS WE ALL DO IMPAIR GAS TAX OR IF THEY GO TO A STORE. THERE'S A SALES TAX PHONE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VARIETY OF ISSUES. TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION YOU INDICATED THAT YOU BELIEVE IN THAT PHILOSOPHY WHY THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN THE STINGS DISTINCTION HERE AS WE'VE ARTICULATED. ALL WELL FOR ONE THING OF CHILDREN ARE YOUNG YOUNGER THAN EIGHTEEN ARE USUALLY LIVING AT HOME OKAY OUT SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HOME OWNERSHIP OR MONTHLY FRENCH AND ALL THOSE THINGS THEY'RE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT JUST. YOU KNOW -- OF WHAT HE COLLEGE DEBT OF DISCRETIONARY INCOME THAT THEY MAKE IT. A PART TIME JOB WHETHER IN SCHOOL SO IT'S NOT SAME RESPONSIBILITY. AS OF AS THE HEAD OF A FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD ARE LIVING ON THEIR OWN EVEN WHEN THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR RENT. FOOD AND CLOTHING AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES WITH IT HEALTH CARE. ALL THOSE THINGS SO THAT'S IS VERY LIMITED IT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE EIGHTEEN SO DOES A LOT OF INDICATIONS THAT THE IN YOUR MIND AS YOU'VE TESTIFIED SO I CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE POSITION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE REPRESENTING THE ORGANIZATION. IS SUCH THAT THE REQUIREMENTS THE THRESHOLD SHOULD BE THAT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR EXAMPLE HOMEOWNERSHIP SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION NOW I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT SAYING THAT BUT IS CERTAINLY IT YOU KNOW OF BEING A HEAD OF A HOUSEHOLD YOU HAVE. OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES EVEN IF YOU'RE LIVING ON YOUR OWN YOU HAVE MORE. REAL LIFE RESPONSIBILITIES YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOURSELF. AND UP SO THE SHORT END THIS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN EIGHTEEN IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE OWN HOMEOWNERSHIP AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN IN FACT I FIND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF THIRTY SIX IN WHICH I SERVED AS MAYOR FOR CITY I CANNOT AFFORD. A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I GREW UP IN -- SO I DO NOT THERE I AM NOT THERE'S NO HOME OWNERSHIP FROM MY END AND I'M THIRTY SIX LITTLE INCHING. RAN YES EMIGRATE EVER SO SO SO IN THAT CASE AGAIN I'M JUST TRYING TO BEST UNDERSTAND THE VANTAGE POINT THAT YOU'RE HAVING A SUGGESTING WITH RESPECT. TO THE DEFINITION OF ONE THAT HAS THE QUALIFICATIONS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE EVEN THOUGH THE PAYING TAXES SO AGAIN NO TAXATION WITHOUT RESERVATION IS SOMETHING THAT YOU A BOOK BELIEVED IN RATS ONE PART OF IT THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE PART OF IT I THINK THE AGE OF JUST. OF DISCRETION OR WHERE THEY CALL THAT WERE IN YOUR DEFINITION OF DEFINITION OF BEING A LIKE ALTURAS ALTA YEAH THERE I THINK THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF DELTA FOR YOU THAN FOR FROM THE ORGANIZATION IS A SHOULD BE WHAT AGE NOW I WE HAVE NO DEFINITION OF ADULTHOOD. YOU KNOW OKAY SO IT IN OTHER WORDS I'M JUST TRYING TO BEST US UNDERSTAND THE POSITION THAT YOU'RE IN THAT YOU'RE PRETTY THAT YOU'RE PRESENTING TO BEST. ARTICULATE THAN WE'VE HEARD THAT THESE ARE CHILDREN AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE TYPE OF ABILITIES ARE VERY WONDERFUL CHILDREN AND VERY ENGAGE CHILDREN I WON'T ARGUE THAT -- AND AND I I ADMIRE ALL THAT THEY'RE DOING AND THERE AND INVOLVEMENT IN THIS. I AM THRILLED TO DEATH THAT THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT POLITICS AND THEY WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT'S THE BEST THING EVER I'M I'M THRILLED TO DEATH ABOUT THAT. BUT BE PATIENT. UP BE PATIENT JUST A LITTLE BIT FEW MORE MONTHS AND YOU'LL BE THERE AT EIGHTEEN AND GO FOR IT. MISTER IF I JUST MIGHT SUMMARIZE THEN OUT. I'VE I PRESS ONE TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE WILL WILL MEET WE HAVE THIS NOTION WE HEARD ON MUCH TESTIMONY THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT PAY TAXES BUT LET'S JUST BE FACTUAL GOT A SEVEN YEAR OLD SHOULD PAY PAY TAX THEY WORK. AND IN FACT IN MY COMMUNITY I HAVE SEEN FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS. WHO HAVE PATENTS PENDING NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR ABILITY? TO ARTICULATE AN ISSUE AND HAVE A SENSE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SO I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO INDIVIDUALS AT A YOUNGER AGE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE THE PROCESS AND HAVE A SAY. A SPECIFICALLY BUT AGAIN I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD THE FAX. DISCUSSED WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE MAY BUT I APPRECIATE THE TEST PLAN THAT YOU HAVE ON THERE A LOT OF WAYS THEY CAN ENGAGE. THANK WITHOUT LOW -- OTHER COUNT YET MISS WEBER. DOC I WANNA I WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU CAME NOW I'M SORRY I WAS LATE RUNNING IN BUT IT'S NOT JUST FOR THIS ISSUE I I WAS IN. COMMITTEES HE PRESENTING BILLS ALL MORNING LONG SO I WILL LET HIM I THANK AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT I'M SORRY I MISSED YOU YOUR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONIES -- I'VE HEARD THEM BEFORE AND AND DAD I THINKS. AS ALWAYS THIS IS THIS BECOMES THE ISSUE OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK IS THE BEST APPROPRIATE WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF VOTING. AND WHAT AND WHERE THE AGE IS AND IS NOT BECAUSE THAT OUT THAT IS ALWAYS OPEN FOR A VARIETY OF CONVERSATIONS -- YOU KNOW I CAN GO IN ONE COMMUNITY AND AND WHICH I HAPPEN TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY -- AND AND THEY DON'T THEY THEY THEY DON'T THINK SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE READY TO VOTE THAT'S JUST AND THESE ARE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WERE TELLING ME THIS. OP AND THERE'S ALWAYS A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE INAPPROPRIATE WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS THAT WE USE -- I THINK WE CAN FIND VERY SHARP AND SMART YOUNG PEOPLE AT EVERY AGE. OF THAT'S THERE ALL THAT OF FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME I CAN FIND VERY RESPONSIBLE TEENAGERS AT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN AND TWENTY ALSO IT'S ALWAYS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE -- IT'S NOT ISSUE WHO PAYS TAXES -- BECAUSE AS SOON AS A KID EARNS A COUPLE DOLLARS SELLING PAPERS OR WHATEVER THEY DO NOWADAYS THEY PAY TAXES SO THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT AND YET WE PROBABLY I DON'T THINK WE WOULD STAND HERE AND ASK FOR EIGHT YEAR OLDS. HAD TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE ARE A WEEK SOME MIGHT BUT I DOUBT IF WE WOULD SO I AT I'M A I'M A PERSON STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT THAT THERE'S A TIME FRAME AND WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE TIME FRAME IN EIGHTEEN IS A TIME FRAME. AND YOU KEEP IF WE KEEP GOING BACKWARDS AND BACKWARDS AND BACKWARDS THEN ADVICE A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS CAN VOTE THEN OBVIOUSLY SXTEEN YEAR OLDS COMPATIBLE BECAUSE THEY GET. PROBABLY GET WAS AS GOOD AN ARGUMENT FOR IT IS THAT AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS COULD VOTE SO I THINK IT CONTINUES TO MOVE IT'S IT'S A MOVING TARGET AND AND UNTIL WE HAVE REAL SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MATURITY WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. A MINUTES DIFFICULT WE HAVE NO TEST WITH MATURITY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THIRTY WHO SHOULD NEVER VOTE OF BUT BUT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE WE KNOW THAT. AND SO SO I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S A BIT AND WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE SO MY POSITION IS NOT A SURPRISE ANYBODY WITH HIS IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THE FLOOR -- THAT I I THINK THERE'S A TIME AND EIGHTEEN IS A TIME WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE WILL WE'VE IDENTIFIED IT -- HAVING BEEN A PART OF AS OLD AS I AM HAVING BEEN A PART OF THE DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD VOTING. OUT THAT CAME INTO BEING BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME REAL TANGIBLE ISSUES IN THE SOCIETY THAT THAT PUSHED US FORWARD TO THAT NUMBER AND NOT JUST BECAUSE WE THOUGHT FOLKS WILL MATURE. BUT WE WERE DRAFTING YOUNG MEN INTO WAR PEOPLE WERE BEING ASKED TO FIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY THEY HAD ACCESS TO CIGARETTES AT THE TIME NOW WE'VE MOVED ON FROM THAT. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT BEEN IDENTIFIED THIS IS THE AGE IN WHICH YOU COULD BE TRIED AS AN ADULT. YOU GO TO ADULT PRISON YOU CAN PUT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN PRISON. AND SO YOU WERE TREATED AS AN ADULT -- THERE WERE FEW BECAME EMANCIPATED MINORS EARLY IN LIFE BECAUSE OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATIONS BUT WE IN MY GENERATION LOOKED AND SAW THAT AND I'D COULD NOT VOTED -- EIGHTEEN LOOKED AND SAW THAT WAITING TO TWENTY ONE BY THAT TIME YOU HAD ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COUNTRY THERE WAS A DRAFT THAT OCCURRED FOR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS. AND AND SO IT LOOK AT THE SITUATION AND SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE ASKING THESE YOUNG MEN TO DIE FOR THEIR COUNTRY TO BE INVOLVED IN WARS AND CONFLICTS AND YET THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT. OKAY THEY HAVE A WORD TO SAY ABOUT WHY THEY SHOULD BE THERE AND SO THAT PUSH THEN BECAME AS A RESULT OF ALL THE WOULD BE ADULT RESPONSIBILITIES. AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE GAVE TO YOUNG PEOPLE WAS THERE. EIGHTEEN A ONCE YOU BECAME EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN BUT YOU WERE CONSIDERED AN ADULT. AND YOU HAD CONSEQUENCES FOR YOUR BEHAVIOR AS AN ADULT AND SO I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A LARGER CONVERSATION -- THAT'S THERE BUT I KIND OF HONOR THE EIGHTEEN BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR THE CONVERSATION AND KNOW WHY CAME INTO EXISTENCE AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THOSE WERE EIGHTEEN THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE MATURE ENOUGH. BUT BUT THE SOCIETY FELT THEY WERE MATURE ENOUGH TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOME SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF LIFE AND DEATH. AND AND AS A RESULT THEY GOT THE RIGHT TO VOTE SO -- I THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND AND WHAT YOU ARE AND I ALWAYS APPRECIATE WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE REALLY ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND COMMITTED TO IT HOPE. IT STAYS THERE WE ARE STRUGGLING NOW TRY TO GET EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS TO VOTE I MEAN YOU KNOW SO -- THAT'S A THAT'S A CHALLENGE AS THE AND I'M NOT SURE OF LEADING WITH VOTED SEVENTEEN SOLVE THE ISSUE THAT WILL FACE. BUT IT TRULY IS A A DISCUSSION THAT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AND AND MAKE SOME FINAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. OF THE ISSUE OF WHAT WE IDENTIFY AS THE QUALIFIERS THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE WHERE IS IT WHERE DOES THE LINE FALL WHAT IT WAS AGE GROUPING THAT'S THERE. THAT'S SO IMPORTANT AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT CONVERSATION YET -- TO DEFY WITH THEIR TRUE CONSEQUENCES ADULT CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO AT DIFFERENT AGES AND THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY. DRIVING ME IN THE IMPORTANCE OF IT SO I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR FOR WHAT OF WHAT YOU SAID TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER AND IT AGAIN I THINK YOU SUMMARIZE A LOT OF MY THOUGHTS. YOU KNOW AS WE WE TEND TO AGREE AND THIS COMMITTEE -- THAT YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL I DO DISAGREE WITH THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE OPPOSITION. I THINK YOU ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME HERE TODAY AND I HAVE TESTIFIED. I THINK YOU ARE MORE THAN MORE THAN CAPABLE OF BEING ABLE TO VOTE AND TO AND TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS -- YOU KNOW. MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. THE OF BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THE OF WHAT I'M INVOLVED IN IN HER OWN INTEREST. KNOWS A LOT ABOUT POLITICS AND TALKS ABOUT THESE ISSUES ALL THE TIME I THINK SHE WOULD BE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF VOTING AND MAKING GOOD DECISIONS. ON BEHALF OF OUR OF OF OUR REPUBLIC -- IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE MADE A SOCIETAL DECISION THAT EIGHTEEN IS THE AGE OF MAJORITY -- AND THAT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY ACROSS YOU KNOW ALL LINES EIGHTEEN IS IS IS IS THE AGE OF MAJORITY -- I AND I THINK THAT IN ORDER TO MOVETHAT NUMBER THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME. REASONABLE AND LOGICAL REASON FOR DOING SO RIGHT -- AND THERE BEEN ARGUMENTS MADE IN THIS BODY. NOT BY MY PARTY. THE BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THEY ARGUE FOR OLDER AGES. THEY SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO BUY TO BUY TOBACCO PRODUCTS FOR INSTANCE. YOU GOT TO BE -- TWENTY ONE THEY MAKE ARGUMENTS IS SAY YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BUY A GUN. UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY ONE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MAKE. YOU CAN'T BE SO YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BE SAFE WITH THAT GUN YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION. AT EIGHTEEN THOSE ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE MAJORITY PARTY HERE. THERE WE WERE LECTURED TO YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW WE CAN'T POSSIBLY HOLD -- PEOPLE WHO COMMIT CRIMES WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE TO AN ADULT STANDARD. BECAUSE QUOTE RECENT NEERAJ NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT COGNITIVE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. CONTINUES WELL BEYOND AGE EIGHTEEN AND INTO EARLY ADULTHOOD FOR BOYS AND YOUNG MEN IN PARTICULAR WERE TOLD. THIS PROCESS CONTINUES INTO THE MID TWENTIES THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE STILL DEVELOPING DURING THIS PROCESS AFFECT JUDGMENT. AND DECISION MAKING AND SO THEY THEREFORE CAN'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR DECISION SO IT'S IT'S NOT MY PARTY. IT'S ARGUING THAT. PEOPLE WHO ARE. EIGHTEEN OR YOUNGER AREN'T ABLE TO MAKE GOOD JUDGMENT DECISIONS IS ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY PARTY THAT CONTINUES TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF ARGUMENTS -- I THINK THAT WE COULD HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR OUR MINERS. IF WE'RE GOING TO SAY THE HEY MINERS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY POLICY. SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE LET'S HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WHY ARE WE STOPPING AT SEVENTEEN AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY MANY PEOPLE. MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD AGAIN PAYS TAXES. SHE HAS HER OWN ALLOWANCE SHE HAS HER OWN MONEY WHEN HE DOESN'T BUY SOMETHING AT A STORE SHE PAYS SALES TAX. YOU CAN'T THE JUSTIFICATION CAM ALONE BE. NO TAXATION WITHOUT WITHOUT REPRESENTATION [inaudible] RIGHT. AND SHE'S JUST AS AFFECTED BY POLICY AND SHE'S CAPABLE OF MAKING JUDGEMENT DECISIONS TO WHY STOP AT SEVENTEEN RIGHT WHY NOT WHY NOT ALLOW ALL YOU KNOW IN IN MANY TRADITIONS. THIRTEEN IS THE AGE OF MAJORITY. IN THE JEWISH TRADITION FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW SO. YOU COULD MAKE IS AS AS DOCTOR WEBER I THINK REALLY LAID OUT YOU KNOW YOU COULD MAKE ARGUMENTS. ALL AROUND BUT WE'VE DECIDED EIGHTEEN IS THE AGE OF MAJORITY. AND UNLESS THERE'S A REALLY GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS. A VERY ARBITRARILY MOVEMENT I MEAN. IF WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT ALL MINOR SHOULD VOTE LET'S MOVE TO THIRTEEN THEN. RIGHT IF WE DO BELIEVE AS HAS BEEN. ARGUED IN THIS BODY THAT NO EVEN AT EIGHTEEN AND UP. TO TWENTY FIVE YOU CAN'T MAKE GOOD JUDGMENT CALLS MAYBE THERE'S AN ARGUMENT FOR MOVING IT UP. RIGHT BUT TO JUST SAY ALL WELL WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT SEVENTEEN WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WHEN A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD. AND A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD. IT JUST SEEMS COMPLETELY ARBITRARY AND IT DOESN'T HAVE. THE STRONG JUSTIFICATION FOR FOR MOVING THAT AGE LIMIT -- AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE END UP IS NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE VERY CAPABLE AND THAT. DECISIONS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A VOICE AND YOU DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL BE -- IT'D GET INVOLVED IN CAMPAIGNS I WAS VERY ACTIVE MYSELF. YOU KNOW I GOT ELECTED THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD. COURSE ALL THESE EXAMPLES OF THE USE OF US CAN ELECTED ROLL OVER. EIGHTEEN RIGHT. AND I WAS VERY ACTIVE POLITICALLY AS YOU ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL I I COULDN'T WAIT TO VOTE I WANTED TO BUT I KNEW THE EIGHTEEN WAS THE H. NOW. AND THAT IS IT WASN'T I DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS UNFAIR. IT'S WHAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED. AND SO -- THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND. I WILL ALLOW -- MR MULLIN TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION IT'S ACTUALLY AN INTERESTINGJUMPING OFF POINT TALKING ABOUT. THE ARBITRARY NATURE OF MOVING. THE VOTING AGE. ACTUALLY WE ARE GROUNDED. IN BECOMING EIGHTEEN BY THE GENERAL ELECTION WE ARE LEGALLY CONNECTED. TO THE AGE OF OF MAJORITY. AND SO. THIS APPROACH IS AN INCREMENTAL ONE RIGHT. THE TURNING SEVENTEEN FOR THE PRIMARY SO FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS BOB WILL BE EIGHTEEN BY THE GENERAL. IF THESE KIDS IF THEY IF THESE VOTERS ARE GOING TO BE PARTICIPATING IN SELECTING FROM A POOL OF CANDIDATES TO THE GENERAL ELECTION WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN THE GET WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN THE GENERAL ELECTION. THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SHAPE THAT POOL OF CANDIDATES. IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION WE ARE LEGALLY LINKING. TO TO BECOMING EIGHTEEN AND PARTICIPATING IN THE PRIMARY IN FACT. NEARLY HALF OF STATES IN THE COUNTRY. THIS IS THE LAW IN HAVE NEARLY HALF THE STATES. ILLINOIS INDIANA KENTUCKY. MISSISSIPPI OHIO SOUTH CAROLINA. JUST TO NAME A HANDFUL. ALREADY THE LAW CALIFORNIA'S BEHIND THE CURVE ON THIS ISSUE. SO WE ARE DOING GREAT ON PRE REGISTRATION AND ALL SORTS OF EFFORTS THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE IS INVOLVED IN. BUT WE ARE TRULY BEHIND. ON THIS ISSUE WHEN WE SHOULD BE LEADING ON THE ISSUE SO BOB EAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A DISCUSSION ON A MISTER LOS AMENDMENT AND APPROACH I ALSO SUPPORT. BY THE WAY. BUT THERE WILL BE A CONVERSATION THAT ENSUES MY HOPE IS THAT BOTHOF OUR A. C. A.'S. MAKE IT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY TO THE SENATE WE WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT JOINING FORCES I'M SURE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT COMPETING. PROPOSALS GOING TO THE BALLOT THAT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE MY INTEREST IS UP. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE CATCH CALIFORNIA UP WITH WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HOW DO WE COME UP WITH AN APPROACH THAT'S VIABLE BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES THIS REQUIRE TWO THIRDS VOTE IN BOTH HOUSES. THIS REQUIRES A MAJORITY VOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PROBABLY AT THE OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY A PRIMARY ELECTION YOU HEARD. A RAGE OF THE ARGUMENTS HERE BUT I WOULD JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ALTHOUGH MY APPROACH -- IS INCREMENTAL. IT'S NOT QUITE AS ASPIRATIONAL -- AS AS MISTER LOWS I DO THINK WE ARE A STRONG LEGAL FOOTING I THINK THIS THIS OB INCREMENTAL APPROACH WOULD BE EMBRACED BY THE VOTERS. OF CALIFORNIA SO WE CAN CATCH UP WITH THE OHIO SINCE SOUTH CAROLINA'S OF THE WORLD. AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR ENTERTAINING THE CONVERSATION AT FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SURFACE US SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE ARE SURE TO HEAR -- OVER THE NEXT DOT NINE MONTHS OR SO AND WITH THAT -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE. I THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN AND I APPRECIATE THAT DON'T OFTEN HEAR US. AT USING SOUTH CAROLINA AS THE MA AS A MODEL IN THIS BODY BUT A FAIR POINT A FAIR POINT -- ALL RIGHT. MATT INCLUDE PLEASE CALL OF THERE IS A MOTION AND SECONDLY BY MISTER LOWE AND MISTER CALDERON. THE MOTION IS BE ADOPTED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN. GALLAGHER. NOBODY GALLAGHER NOT VOTING CALDERON. CALDERON I LOW. LOW MAYES. MAYES NOT PHONY MULLIN. AYE MULLIN AYE WEBER. WEBER NOT VOTING. OKAY THE BILLS ON CALL -- AND WE WILL. AWAITFOR OTHER MEMBERS TO GET HERE. ONE BRING THAT BACK UP AGAIN I DO SEE THAT WE HAVE SENATOR UMBERG HERE SO WHY DON'T WE TAKE HIM -- I KNOW HE'S BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY OVER THE AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE WITNESSES WHO CAME HERE AND AN INVOICE THERE. CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL SENATOR. THANK YOU ARE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SO -- A COUPLE COMMENTS BEFORE WE BEGIN PRESENTATION OF COMING NUMBER ONE YOUR CHIEF CONSULTANT ESTHER JONES INFORMS THE THAT WHEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN RETURNS WILL BE FOR FORMER CHEERS OF THIS COMMITTEE -- CURRENT FORMER TEACHERS IS. PRESENT. YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY REFLECTION -- WITH RESPECT TO MISTER JONES AND HIS INABILITY TO ACTUALLY KEEP A CHAIR. BUT THAT'S THAT'S ONE OBSERVATION THE SECOND OBSERVATION IS THIS IS SORT OF LIKE VISUAL LOOKING AT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MISTER CALDERON. AND MR MULLIN WHOSE FATHERS I SERVED WITH BACK IN THE DAY SO PLEASE GIVE THEM MY REGARD MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SERVE WITH MISTER JOHN THAT'S EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE HIM YOU KNOW THAT'S THE THE GLASS IS HALF FULL ISN'T IT. YES. THANK YOU -- SO BEFORE YOU -- MEMBERS IS -- SB -- SEVENTY TWO SB -- SEVENTY TWO MARKS THE THE LAST YEAR MARKED THE FIRST TIME CALIFORNIA'S VERSION OF SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION WAS AVAILABLE -- FOR STATEWIDE ELECTIONS -- THE LAW REQUIRES. THESE VOTERS WHO WISH TO VOTE OF INVESTORS SAME DAY TO COMPLETE AN AFFIDAVIT OF CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION AND CAST PROVISIONAL BALLOT. THE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS TABULATED ONLY. AFTER THE REGISTRATION IS CHECKED FOR VALIDITY AGAIN SO SECURITY AND DMV RECORDS IN THE STATEWIDE VOTER DATABASE TO ENSURE THE VOTER DID NOT ALREADY RECEIVE ABOUT ELSEWHERE. IN SOME WAYS THE SYSTEM WORK VERY WELL FOR INSTANCE OVER FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND SAME DAY BALLOTS WERE CAST IN THE GENERAL ELECTION ALONE. THE SECTORS STATE REPORTS THAT THERE WERE NO REPORTED INSTANCES OF FRAUD ASSOCIATED WITH THEM ANYWHERE. THE THE GLARING PROBLEM HOWEVER IS THAT THE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION SIMPLY WASN'T OFFERED ENOUGH LOCATIONS I KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN ORANGE COUNTY. YOU COULD SEE THAT FOLKS WERE INTERESTED IN VOTING IN WERE LINED UP IN REMAIN FOR HOURS AT THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS OFFICE IN SANTA ANA LONG LONG AFTER THE POLLS HAD CLOSED AT EIGHT PM. OUR CURRENT LAW REQUIRES ONLY THAT THE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION -- BE OFFERED IN PERMANENT OFFICES THE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS AND IT VOTE CENTERS AND COUNTIES PARTICIPATING IN THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN LA COUNTY THAT MAY MEAN YOU'D HAVE TO GO FROM LANCASTER TO DOWNEY TO BE ABLE TO REGISTER TO VOTE ON THE SAME DAY. ONLY FIVE NON. VOTER CHOICE ACT COUNTIES CHOSE TO OFFER SAME DAY REGISTRATION AND VOTING ON ELECTION DAY AWAY FROM THE PERMANENT OFFICES AS RESULT THOUSANDS OF THOSE WERE FORCED TO WAIT. AN HOURS LONG LINES OR NOT VOTE AT ALL -- SOLD -- BEFORE YOU IS SB SEVENTY TWO WHICH BOB PERMITS COUNTIES CHOOSE FROM CELLS REALLY WANT TO GO HIGH TECH WITH THE LOOKED EXCUSE ME. WHETHER THEY THEY WANT -- TO PROVIDE FOR SAME DAY. VOTER REGISTRATION AT THE POLLING PLACES AS WELL AS IT OF BOTH CENTERS -- WITH ME HERE ARE SEVERAL FOLKS WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT MISS MICHELLE WHO VOTED -- ON SAME DAY WITH SAME DAY REGISTRATION UBER AND RUBBLE MISIA'S WITH THE ACLU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE SECOND MOVED AND SECONDED BY MISTER LOW IN CALDERON AGAIN. YES GO AHEAD. PLEASE PROCEED WITNESSES. GET MEMBERS THE MANY ROMANS YES. I'M HAVE A SO YOU HAVE CALIFORNIA. SO SB SEVENTY TWO WOULD. GIVE VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY COULD MANAGE OF ELECTION DAY REGISTRATION. AT ANY POLLING SITE. ELECTION RICK ELECTION DAY REGISTRATION HAS BEEN SHOWN. IN OTHER STATES TO SIGNIFICANTLY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED VOTER TURNOUT PARTICULARLY AMONG STE HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED VOTERS INCLUDING VOTERS OF COLOR YOUNG VOTERS AND LOW INCOME VOTERS. LAST YEAR WE ARE EXCITED THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVERY COUNTY WOULD. WOULD PROVIDE ELECTION DAY REGISTRATION AT THERE CAN ELECTIONS OFFICE AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SATELLITE LOCATIONS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY -- THE REGULATIONS IMPLEMENT THE BILL WERE DEVELOPED AND AND THE WEIGHT IT WAS ROLL ROLLED OUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SATELLITE LOCATIONS. AND AS WAS MENTIONED ONLY A HANDFUL OF COUNTIES ACTUALLY PROVIDED MORE THAN A SINGLE SITE ON ELECTION DAY -- SO AS A RESULT WE DIDN'T SEE AS MANY VOTERS TAKE ADVANTAGE. AS SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ELECTION DAY REGISTRATION AS WE WOULD HAVE HOPED -- AND AS WAS MENTIONED THAT WE SAW LINES ALL AROUND THE STATE. IN SOME COUNTIES THE REPORTS OF LINES UP TO THREE OR FOUR HOURS. AND BECAUSE OF THIS KIND IS ONLY A SINGLE SITE TO ANOTHER WAS RELATIVELY LOW NUMBER VOTERS USING IT THAT REALLY BACKED UP THE SYSTEM. SO. I'M AN ADULT SAID ACCORDING TO DATA WE WE RECEIVED FROM. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CORRECT ELECTIONS OFFICIALS THEY WERE FIFTY THOUSAND VOTES CAST ON ELECTION DAY IN NOVEMBER AT POLLING SITES AND THESE BALLOTS I'M COULD BE COUNTED BECAUSE THEY WERE. THOSE VOTERS WENT RICHARD ABOUT TEN TO THE SYSTEM THESE ARE -- THESE VOTERS WOULD BE NAY THEIR PROVISIONAL BALLOTS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COUNT BECAUSE UNDER SB. SEVENTY TWO SO SB SIX SEVENTY TWO WOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO ACCESS -- TO TO ELECTION DAY REGISTRATION EVERY POLLING SITE. AND IT ALSO GIVES ELECTION OFFICIALS AND THE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY WANT TO IMPLEMENT THIS SO THEY CAN GO FOR THE HIGH TECH RIP RAP HERE WITH WITH -- WITH AGAIN ELECTRONIC -- BOOKS AND THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE EVERY EVERY BALLOT TYPE IF THEY HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE WHERE THEY COULD JUST SIMPLY PROVIDE VOTERS A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. IN THERE -- AT THAT PULLING SITE TO THE BALLOT TYPE THAT IS AVAILABLE. AND BY USING A POLLING SITE A PROVISIONAL BALLOT HE WOULD ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE VOTE STATEMENT AS WAS MENTIONED THAT. THE ELECTION OFFICIALS WILL BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ONLY WANT ONE THAT WAS KEPT SPEECH VOTER. SO -- FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE URGE AND I VOTE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MICHELLE WEIGHING FIRST OFF THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. I'M A SOPHOMORE AT UC BERKELEY STUDYING ECONOMICS AND I'M ALSO AN INTERN ON CALPERS NEW BUT THIS PROJECT. THIS PAST MEDINA ELECTION CALPERS REGISTERED OVER SIX THOUSAND NEWSTUDENT VOTERS. AND MADE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND GET OUT THE VOTE. EFFORTS LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION DESPITE ALL THESE EFFORTS. THERE ARE STILL MANY BARRIERS FACING STUDENTS IN THE VOTING PROCESS I MYSELF AM FROM INDIANA. WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNING TO VOTE VIA MAIL IN BALLOT UNFORTUNATELY. MY BALLOTS NOT ARRIVE IN TIME SO I FACE THE DILEMMA THAT STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA BASED EVERY ELECTION WHETHER TO SACRIFICE THE ADDITIONAL TIME AND EFFORT NEEDED TO CONDITIONALLY REGISTER. OR TO SACRIFICE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. I ULTIMATELY WENT TO DOWNTOWN OAKLAND TO CONDITIONALLY REGISTER AND IN THE END ALL THE PROCESS TOOK OVER THREE HOURS. THIS IS AN ASK THAT WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIOUS MAINTAIN OF PEOPLE WHO FACE VERY COMMON ISSUES WITH THEIR VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. AND INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF POLLING PLACES THE OFFER SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION WOULD REMOVE MANY OF THE BARRIERS THAT BASE VOTERS TODAY. SB SUNNY TO PASSING WOULD PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY POTENTIAL VOTER HAS OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. IN AN ELECTION. ON ELECTION DAY AND THIS WOULD EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND REINVIGORATE OUR DEMOCRACY THAT WORKS BEST WHEN EVERY PERSON IS ABLE TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA. LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. YOUR ROSE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS TO CALIFORNIA WHERE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND STRONG SUPPORT. BECAUSE I DON'T REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE ALSO CO SPONSOR OLSON VERY STRONG SUPPORT.

OKAY THANK YOU -- AND THEN WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANOTHER WITNESSES WANT TO TESTIFY WOULD BE FINE TOO BUT GO AHEAD SIR. THANK YOU SIR -- MY NAME IS ROLE RODRIGUEZ JUNIOR FOR ANOTHER WITNESS YET COME ON UP. GO AHEAD SIR [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YES [inaudible] BACK. WHICH IS A PERSON. HAVE SOMEONE. ELSE ON THE HEAD SO GO AHEAD SIR GO YOU GO AHEAD AND TESTIFY OKAY THANK YOU MY NAME IS ROLE RODRIGUEZ JR AND I HAVE -- WORKED ELECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE PAST -- EIGHTEEN YEARS I ALSO RAN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE AND IN THE LAST ELECTION. I CAME IN THIRD. AND THE REASON WHY I AM SITTING HERE IN OPPOSITION. TO SB SEVENTY TWO IS BECAUSE YOUR AS I WORKED ELECTIONS ALL THESE YEARS I'VE LEARNED THE PROCESS I'VE LEARNED EVERY JOB. THAT REQUIRED TO BE PART OF THE BOARDING PROCESS -- IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE UP. PROVISIONAL BALLOT TO SOMEONE. FOR WHATEVER REASON AND THERE'S A PROCESS FOR RECEIVING UP OF PROVISIONAL BALLOT. AND THE POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE HIS SAID -- THE VOTERS HAVE AMPLE TIME TO REGISTER TO VOTE. IF THEY DON'T REGISTERED TO VOTE THAN WHEN THEY GO TO VOTING TO AVOID HIM -- PROCESS OR THERE WILL VOTING SITE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTER PER OF VOTE BY A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. SO ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS FILL OUT A FORM AND THE SUPERVISOR WILL HELP THAT PERSON FILL OUT THAT FORM SO THAT. HE OR SHE GOES TO THE PROPER PROCESS. SO I AM OPPOSED TO SB SEVENTY TWO BECAUSE THERE'S A PROCESS THERE ALREADY. FOR WHAT. WE CAN DO TO HELP A PERSON. ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR AND SMITH AND I WOULD US IF YOU HAVE THE IF YOU'RE GONNA READ THE LETTER OUT WE HAVE THE LETTER SO WE DON'T NEED TO READ THE LETTER IF YOU HAVE PERSONAL TESTIMONY WANNA GIVE AS TO WHY YOU'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THAT WOULD BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMITTEE I THINK. YOU'VE GOT THE RED LETTER -- IF YOU HAVE TIME TO READ IT -- MAINLY THE THE THE MAIN POINT IS THAT OF THE TERM WELL. HEAD COACH. OF THE ROLE OF POLL WORKERS IS IS TERRIBLY DEMANDING AND EXHAUSTING AND EXPECTING THOUSANDS OF POLL WORKERS TO ADD TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES. OF WITH THE PROPER REGISTRATION AND PROCESSING OF NEW VOTERS. IS ASKING FOR DISASTER AND WE'VE GOT LOTS OF EXAMPLES. OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT HAPPENED BUT IT THAT'S IN THE LETTER SO IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO READ THAT I A LONG SO ANYWAY -- THAT'S IT THAT WILL LET YOU READ THE LETTER I GUESS A FEW. YEAH I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO READ EXCERPTS IS FINE IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE THE THE WHOLE INTERVIEW HABIT YEAH I JUST. WOULD LIKE TO GET IT ON THE RECORD SO. BASICALLY THE THE CHALLENGES OF PROPER ELECTION MANAGEMENT ARE ALREADY MONUMENTAL AND MOVING CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION TO LOCAL POLLING POLLING SITES. A WILL GUARANTEE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF VOTES WILL BE MISHANDLED AND OF THAT DILUTES EVERY MISHANDLED VOTE CANCELS A VOTE OF A LEGITIMATE VOTER. SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THIS -- AND THEN PEOPLE THAT ARE GIVEN. OF THE WRONG BALLOTS THAT'S ALSO AN ISSUE SO IT IT'S ALL LISTED IN THERE SO I WON'T [inaudible] BOB GALE. YEAH YOU'RE NOT BUGGING ME ANY AND THEN YOU DO THAT IF YOU HAD ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD. PLEASE DO. ALL RIGHT I'M TIRED OF READING GO AHEAD. FOR ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MY NAME IS GWEN MYERS AND I'M OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU. MY NAME STAFF KATANA ADAM HUNGER PERCENT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. DIANA BARBA OPPOSED. STELLA MAY. CONCERNED CITIZENS THE CALIFORNIA ABSOLUTELY OPPOSE FOREIGN INTERFERENCE BUT BY ELECTRONICS. OF YOU TALK ABOUT RUSSIA RUSSIA CHINA THIS OPENS UP AT ALL BECAUSE THREE MONTHS AGO. TWO THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS WERE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THE ELECT. THE ELECTRONIC VOTE AND THEY WERE ABLE TO FLIP THE VOTE SO THIS IS OPEN UP A CAN OF WORMS THANK YOU. THE TREES FIND SUPPOSED TO THIS VOTE. WE MEANT TO BURY NO. GRACE IS GOOD NO. TYPICAL LEGAL VOTER AGAINST RAMP IT AND CHECK VOTER FRAUD JUST SAY NO. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER OKAY -- SEE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] SPEECHES. IN OUR CHAIRMAN IS BACKS ALTERNATE BACK OVER HIM. THANK YOU MISTER VICE SURPLUS IS A GREAT JOB. IN MY ABSENCE WE HAVE A MOTION. DO WE HAVE A SECOND. WE HAVE A SECOND -- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MANY COLLEAGUES I WOULD JUST SAY VERY QUICKLY AND WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW HAD A LOT OF THIS DISCUSSION BUT YOU KNOW I I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS REALLY THAT THERE STILL ARE ISSUES WITH. ENSURING THAT. YOUR THIS IS AN ELIGIBLE VOTER -- AND WE HAVE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEM. AS I'VE SAID THIS IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS. AND YOU KNOW COUNTIES ARE OVERWHELMED I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN THIS LETTER -- IS YOU KNOW IT'S VERY HARD FOR OUR POLL WORKERS ALREADY DEAL WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES TO REQUIRE EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD POLLING PLACE -- TO PROVIDE FOR THAT -- WE DO WE ALREADY PROVIDE THIS BY THE WAY I MEAN IT'S JUST BE POINTED OUT WE HAVE VOTING CENTERS FOR FOURTEEN DAYS PRIOR TO THE ELECTION WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO AND DO SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. YOU WE CAN GO TO THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE DO THE SAME THING FOR FOURTEEN DAYS PRIOR TO THE ELECTION -- AND AND EVEN ON THE SAME DAY. ON THE ELECTION DAY YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AS WELL IT'S JUST THAT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AT EVERY SINGLE POINT LOCATION THIS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THIS. WE ALL GO TO THESE POLLING LOCATIONS -- YOU KNOW IT IT'S HARD TO GET VOLUNTEERS THERE. IT'S IT IS NOT EASY. TO YEAH I MEAN TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE GIVING THE PERSON THE RIGHT. ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE AT THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE WERE AT THE VOTING CENTERS THEY HAVE THOSE MORE OF THOSE RESOURCES SO -- YOU KNOW TO ME I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. WE SHOULD BE FIRST OF ALL ENSURE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE. REASONABLE -- FOR COUNTIES WHO ARE WHO ARE CARRYING OUT THESE ELECTIONS AND THEN SECONDLY. AT AND I WAS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY ENSURE THAT IT'S YOU KNOW THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS OF THIS IS AN ELIGIBLE VOTER. THAT THEY ARE IN FACT RESIDING IN THIS DISTRICT IN. AN ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN THE ELECTION. THANK YOU MISTER RESTER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. COLLEAGUES BRING BACK TO THE SENDER TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A TWO COMMENTS OF THE FIRST AT AT THE MISTER RODRIGUEZ IS THAT. YOUR COMMENTS WITH RESPECT -- TO SAME DAY VOTING THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES -- SECOND IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO VOTE AND AND REGISTER ON THE SAME DAY -- SOME COUNTIES DON'T HAVE. OF VOTE CENTERS AND SO THOSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE VOTE CENTERS THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. AT POLLING PLACES IT DOES REQUIRE THAT WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING BUT YOUR POINT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER IS THAT AS WE EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES THE VOTE I DO EXPECT THAT THEY'LL BE. FEWER INSTANCES OF OF SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION -- AND IN IN MY VIEW OF THE MORE WE EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE -- WHO ARE CITIZENS TO VOTE THE BETTER WE ARE WE ARE AS A DEMOCRACY JUST TO UNDERLINE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ONE IS THAT? BEFORE -- A VOTE IS TABULATED IT IS CHECKED FOR VALIDITY AGAINST SO SECURITY IN DMV RECORDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS VOTER HAS NOT VOTED SOMEWHERE ELSE OR IS NOT HEAD. OF RECEIVE TO BALANCE SO HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG. CONDITIONALLY VOTER REGISTRATION WAS ROLLED OUT IN STATEWIDE ELECTIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST YEAR -- NEARLY SIXTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT POLICY TO VOTE AND LOST A MEMBER STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION. CONDITIONALLY VOTER REGISTRATION IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFULLY USED IN COUNTIES WHERE WAS MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE. SO SPENDING THE AVAILABILITY OF CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION IS A LOGICAL NEXT STEP. I'M HAPPY TO CO AUTHOR THIS BILL AND I'M RECOMMENDING AND I VOTE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND BE REFER RE REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI. BERMAN I'D GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CALDERON. CALDERON I LOW. LITTLE I MAYES MULLIN. MULLIN AYE WEBER. SO THE BILL PASSES -- WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND I SEE CENTER AMBERG THAT WE HAVE -- IT SB FIVE OH FIVE I SEE THE COMMITTEE GOT. TWO BILLS WALL IS GONE FOR AN HOUR THAT'S VERY EFFICIENT. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT. BUT WE'LL KEEP CHUGGING ALONG AND MAYBE ORDER LUNCH. MR HERE MAY MASSIVE IN A QUERY PLEASE UP WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL BEFORE US WHICH IS SB FIVE OH FIVE THAT IS THERE'S A SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE IS THAT CORRECT. IS THAT CORRECT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REPUBLICAN RECOMMENDATIONS -- IS THAT IS IT IT YES I SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION THANK YOU. FOR LETTING US KNOW. WITH THE FACT THAT WE'RE MOTION AND SECOND. SHALL I CLOSE YES SIR ALL RIGHT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA ORIGINAL VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I WORK AT SB ONE FIFTY ONE YES IS THE GOVERNMENT BETTER LEVEL FIVE OH FIVE FIVE OH BY THE WILL OF THE ONE FIFTY ONE WAS PASSED ON CONSENT -- I WAS WONDERING. YEAH BUT THE BOB WILL GET TO IT. ANYONE IS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. MY NAME IS CITY WEBER ON THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR HE SUFFERED A PART OF CALIFORNIA -- WE'VE BEEN [inaudible] WORKING. TO TRY TO MAKE THIS BILL SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LIVE WITH. THAT THE BILLS IN CHANGED -- IN MANY POSITIVE WAYS -- HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. AND I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EMERGENCY -- WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE ARE TWO MAIN ISSUES -- WHY THEY WANTED? TO HAVE THIS BILL. IT WAS -- TO CLARIFY -- THE DEFINITION OF A GENERALLY RECOGNIZED CANDIDATE. TO PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY AGENERALLY RECOGNIZED CANDIDATE IS ONE IS FILED. WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION. AND THE SO THAT THAT'S MAKE SURE RECOGNIZED -- ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT. I THINK THIS IS THE SORT OF A REACH TOO FAR -- BUT SECTORS STATE. TWO REASONS THAT WERE GIVEN WAS -- ONE THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY I GUESS PUT A A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT THAT THEY HAD NOT -- CONTACTED AND GET ITS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT. THE SOLUTION THAT WE SUGGESTED WAS THAT. AT CANDIDATES SUBMIT THE REQUEST TO THE PARTIES. AND THEN THE PARTY WILL DECIDE WHICH CANDIDATE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE IT'S BALLOT. AND THEY SUBMIT THAT LIST TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE ALONG WITH THE A LETTERS IN THE CANDIDATES. WE THINK THAT WOULD TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THE OTHER -- PROBLEM. WAS THAT -- THE CASE WITH PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY THE GREEN PARTY -- WE OFTEN HAVE CANDIDATES. THE SAME CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR THE SAME OFFICE ON BOTH BOTH BALLOTS [inaudible] AND IN THE PAST THE SOME SECRETARY OF STATE'S THE STEP THAT. AND WE HAVE THE PRIMARY BALLOT. KITTENS IN A GREEN BAR WE HAVE THE SAME CANDIDATE. CURRENT SECURITY STATUS REFUSED TO DO THAT A ROOF -- HAD A CANDIDATE -- GOING SO FAR AS TO PLEAD THE CASE OF WHY SHE WANTED. ON OUR BALLOT. SHE WAS NOT PUT OUR BALLOT ISSUES FROM THE GREEN BALLOT. SO. IT'S SINCE BEEN ISSUE AND AND PART OF THE BILL THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT -- DEALS WITH. WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT? BUYING FIND THE WORDING -- BUT IT'S TALKS ABOUT. SUBMIT A FORM AND THAT FORM. THE WAY IT'S WORDED SOUNDS LIKE IT CAN ONLY BE. US. SUBMITTED FOUR ONE ONE CANDIDATE FOR ONE PARTY ONLY. AND IF THAT'S THE INTENT THEN THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE. A DUTCH MEMBER WHAT WE WANT TO DO IN OUR PARTY. THANK YOU THE MAIN DISHES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING ABOUT HOPE PLEASE COME ON OBSERVE. DOES NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION WOULD BE GREAT. JOHN RIEGER STATE CHAIR FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY I JUST WANT TO SECOND WHAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS SAID. OF WE FEEL THAT THIS IS AN OVER REACH AND FOR A SALUTE OF SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM AND THERE IS NO PROBLEM. WE WOULD STRONGLY URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WOULD NOW LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. WITH. A LOT YOU MISTER CHAIR. OUT ON THAT WE GO BACK AND YEAH I DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT YESTERDAY IN THE SENATE YEAH RIGHT YES IT. THIS MOCK WAS YOUR BOSS IT WAS SHE WHAT RIGHT. TWENTY YEARS AGO AND I SCHOOL. JUST WANTED TO CLEAR BY TIFFANY MOCK ON BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE THAT THE EXAMPLE FOR THE CLARIFICATION THAT WAS GIVEN OF THE THE SECRETARY STATES UP THIS BILL AND IS PROUD SPONSORED. TO ENSURE CLARITY IN THE PROCESS AND TO PROVIDE THAT -- IN THE CASE THAT WAS NOTED THAT IT'S REGARDLESS OF PARTY THAT WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT CANDIDATES HAD AN INTEREST IN BEING ON THE BALLOT AND IN SEARCHING FOR SOME CANDIDATES WE HAD. MUCH STE DEATH TIME DEVOTED TO THAT BECAUSE WE COULD NOT LOCATE THEM DUE TO THE PROCESS BEFORE BUT WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS PROVIDED AN OF THE FORD. FOR DRIVER. YOU STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT MARK. THE CENTER I'M IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE IT UP. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS AMAZINGLY THE CURRENT LAW PROVIDES THE SECTORS STATED HIS OR HER DISCRETION TO DECIDE WHO GOES ON THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY BALLOT -- IN THEORY THE CURRENT SECRETARY OF STATE COULD DECIDE THAT THE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT A VIABLE CANDIDATE THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. BUT IT IS IT IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE OTHER THRESHOLD IS FAIRLY LOW AND IS MISS MOCK POINTS OUT THERE. THE OKAY WE WE WE PASSED THAT AS I'M SORRY IS. MISS MOCK POINTS OUT -- IN THE PAST YOU YOU COULD BE PLACED ON THE BALLOT WITHOUT EVEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF AND SO FOR EXAMPLE A MANY OF US WOULD NOT WANT TO BE THE INVOLUNTARY CANDIDATE ON THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY. OF OF BALLOT SO OF FOR THOSE RESERVES AND I WILL THANK YOU SENATOR. THIS BILL INCREASES TRANSPARENCY TO CANDIDATES AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE STANDARD STANDARDS USED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DETERMINE WHICH CANDIDATES ARE PLACED ON THE BALLOT AT PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTIONS. AND IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT IMPOSE UNREASONABLE BARRIERS TO THE BALLOT FOR CANDIDATES OF COURSE OR IS THE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. SO HAPPY TO RECOMMEND SUPPORT FOR THE BILL MADAM SECRETARY WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND BE REFERRED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BERMAN HI BERMAN AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER AYE CALDERON. CALDERON I'D LOW.% NO I MAYES. MULLIN [inaudible] WEBER. THAT BILLS OUT WILL BE THE ROLE OF FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER [inaudible] THANKS.

MR LOEHMANN READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CHAIR MEMBERS OUT BECAUSE WE I JUST PREVIOUSLY HEARD -- SIMILAR TO RATIONS OF THIS -- LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL I'LL JUST BE VERY BRIEF -- THIS IT ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WITH OVER FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS A CO AUTHOR IN SPONSORING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AGAIN WITH OVER A TWENTY FIVE CO AUTHORS AGAIN MULTIPLE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD BE AN INCREASED EFFORT TO INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION AND OF HIS RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE HAVE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT GREAT. PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY GOOD MORNING SIR CHAIRED MEMBERS MY NAME IS EMMA GARSON I'M SEVENTEEN AND I WORK IN GRASSROOTS EFFORTS TO EMPOWER YOUTH THROUGH POLITICAL ADVOCACY. I SERVED AS A YOUTH DELEGATE TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND I LAUNCHED THE HASHTAG PRE REG SIXTEEN CAMPAIGN. I'M SPEAKING BEFORE YOU TODAY JUST WEEKS AFTER THE HUNDRED YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT GUARANTEEING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE TO CONTINUE THE EXPANSION OF REPRESENTATION IN OUR DEMOCRACY. I'M SPEAKING BECAUSE THE FUTURE DEPENDS ON YOUNG PEOPLE TO SAVE IT AND TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENABLE THEM TO DO SO BY TURNING STUDENTS INTO VOTERS. IT'S NO SECRET THAT YOUTH ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN OUR COUNTRY. THE LOWEST PERCENTAGES OF REGISTERED AN ACTIVE VOTERS ARE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AND THIS ISN'T BECAUSE WE'RE IN DIFFERENT WHEN IT COMES TO WASHINGTON. IT'S BECAUSE AT AGE EIGHTEEN THE WEIGHT OF UPROOTING ONESELF FROM FAMILY BALANCING CLASSES WITH WORK AND PAYING OFF STUDENT LOANS IS ENOUGH TO KEEP ANY STUDENT FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. AS A RESULT MANY OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS FAILED TO REFLECT THE VALUES OF OUR YOUTH. AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE THE FUTURE AREN'T HAVING A SAY IN WHAT THAT FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. BUT AZ EIGHT WOULD GIVE POLITICAL POWER TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INFORMED ENGAGED INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND GRADUATE CITIZENS PREPARED TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN OUR SOCIETY. THE REALITY IS THAT CHEN Z. HAD TO GROW UP FAST. MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF A WORLD WAR MASS SHOOTINGS ARE NOT CONSTANT IN EVERY DAY LIFE. AND INSTEAD OF BEING DRAFTED INTO WARS AND DYING ON THE BATTLEFIELD WE'RE DYING ON OUR OWN SOIL IN OUR OWN SCHOOLS. THIS IS OUR LIFE AND OUR DEATH AND PEOPLE SAY THAT WE NEED TO BE PATIENT BUT FRANKLY I HAVE A PROBLEM BEING PATIENT WILL PEOPLE WHO LOOKED JUST LIKE ME ARE BEING KILLED. JUST LIKE VIETNAM WE WILL INHERIT A WAR ON TERROR THAT STARTED BEFORE WE WERE BORN. WE HAD TO GROW UP FAST BECAUSE WE HAD TO SEE MORE THROUGH OUR SCREENS ADOPTING TO PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE THAT IS FLOOD MAKES OUR PARENTS. THIS SPEED OF CHANGE MEANS THAT DECISIONS BEING MADE TODAY ABOUT PRIVACY AND PROTECTION ABOUT JOBS AND HEALTH CARE AND IMMIGRATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WE'LL ALL HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE WORLD THAT OUR GENERATION LIVES IN. WE AMERICA'S YOUTH HAVE FOUNDER VOICES AND WE ARE READY TO BE HEARD THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON A CA EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. MY NAME IS EIGHT AND LANDED ON THE NEWLY ELECTED YOU'VE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ALL PART OF THE CALIFORNIA YMCA YOUTH IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. I CAME HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY FELLOW YOU CAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATES TO VOICE OUR SUPPORT FOR AC. EIGHT AND INVESTMENT IN THE YOUTH OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE YOUNG VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA HAD THE LOWEST TURNOUT ALL DEMOGRAPHICS AND LOCAL AND STATE ELECTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE. AND I BELIEVE THAT A CH IS THAT CHANGE THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED. IN OUR DEMOCRACY THE IMPORTANCE OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT FAR EXCEEDS PARTY LINES. WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BOTH CO SPONSORING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WE'VE BEEN SHOWN THAT CREATING A GENERATION OF FUTURE VOTERS THAT PLAY THEIR ROLE IN SOCIETY IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN CAN GET BEHIND. WE ARE THE GENERATION THAT WILL BE VOTING TO SOLVE THE PRESSING ISSUES OF OUR STATE. BY CLIMATE CHANGE. THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AND THE MASS SHOOTING EPIDEMIC. AS CALIFORNIANS WE MUST TAKE THAT LEAD. I LOWER THE VOTING AGE TO SEVENTEEN SO DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION. COULD BECOME A HABIT FROM A YOUNG AGE. BY PASSING A C. EIGHT WE WILL PRESENT THE YOUTH WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BECOMING ENGAGED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. AT A TIME WHEN THEY'RE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE GOVERNMENT CLASS THEIR HIGH SCHOOL. THIS WILL TURN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT INTO A PRIORITY OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEMS. I SCHOOLS WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO NEGLECT ITS RELEVANCE. SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE ALREADY ENTRUSTED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENLISTING IN THE MILITARY AND PAYING TAXES. SO VOTING IS THE NEXT STEP. LOWERING THE VOTING AGE WILL TURN MY GENERATION INTO HABITUAL LIFELONG VOTERS. WHO VOTE IN EVERY SINGLE ELECTION? SOMETHING CAME HERE TODAY. ON BEHALF OF MY THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED FELLOW DELEGATES TO SUPPORT ACA AIDS. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY GENERATION MUST IMPROVE THE WORLD AROUND THEM WITH THEIR VOTES. AND IT ALL STARTS BY LOWERING THE VOTING AGE. TO SEVENTEEN THIS IS NOT AN ARBITRARY TIME TO MAKE THIS DECISION. AS WE ARE IN A CRISIS AS OUR STATE FACES EMBARRASSINGLY LOW VOTER TURNOUT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DAMAGE OUR DEMOCRACY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS AND WE MUST NOT SIT IDLY BY AND LET THIS HAPPEN. WE SUPPORT ACA AIDS. AND WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE HI. UNLIKE THE CALIFORNIA ELECTORATE DECIDE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIRED MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS PROUD SPONSORS OF AC. EIGHT AS THE POLITICAL ARM OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT CLTV RECOGNIZES THAT EXPANDING ACCESS TO DEMOCRACY IS AN ESSENTIAL AND POWERFUL WAY TO CHANGE WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND POLICY. CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL INCREASING VOTER ACCESS BUT WHAT WE CAN DO A WEEK WE CAN DO MORE TO INSTILL CONFIDENCE IN OUR YOUTH. THAT THEIR VOTE VOICE MATTERS AND IS VALUABLE. AND TO REVERSE THAT HISTORICAL TREND OF YOUNGER GENERATIONS HAVING LOWER VOTER TURN OUT. FOR MANY YOUNG ADULTS THEIR FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THAT POLITICAL PROCESS STARTS IN THAT HIGH SCHOOL GOVERNMENT CLASS AT A TIME WHEN MANY STUDENTS ARE STILL. SEVENTEEN YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED MOST BY ISSUES SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE AND DESERVE TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD IN UPCOMING ELECTIONS. THEY'RE THE LEADERS ELECTED INTO OFFICE OVER THE NEXT DECADE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLIMATE POLICIES THAT WILL AFFECT THE NEXT GENERATION'S FUTURE THE MOST. AND SHOULD PROPERLY REPRESENT THEM. CATASTROPHIC WILD PRIVATE BUYERS DROUGHTS FLOODING. RECORD BREAKING HEAT WAVES HAZARDOUS AIR QUALITY AND MORE EXTREME AND FREQUENT WEATHER EVENTS HAVE BECOME THE NEW NORMAL FOR CALIFORNIA. AND FOR YOUNG CALIFORNIANS TODAY CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T A DISTANT CONCEPT IT'S HAPPENING NOW. THE LIVES AT OR THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE THEM MORE THAN QUALIFIED TO PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS BECAUSE ELECTIONS HAVE VERY REAL AND TANGIBLE EFFECTS ON THEIR LIVES. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OUT FRONT AND THEIR LEADING ON CLIMATE ACTION. YOUTH ORGANIZATION LIKE THE SUN RISE WITH YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE SUNRISE MOVEMENT. HAVE ORGANIZED THEMSELVES TO HOLD GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE IN ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. ON MARCH FIFTEENTH YOUNG PEOPLE ALL OVER CALIFORNIA JOINT USE ALL OVER THE GLOBE TO GO ON STRIKE IN THE NAME OF URGENT CLIMATE ACTION. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ORGANIZED THEIR MARCHING AND THEY'RE LEADING AND NOW IT'S TIME TO EXTEND TO THEM THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN DEMOCRACY.

NOTICE NO OE THIS IS IN OPPOSITION BRING BACK TO CALL. FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MOTION SECONDS MISTER ROYSTER WE HAVE A MOTION. THANK YOU WE HAVE A SECOND. SO ONE THING I'D SAY THE YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE THIS -- AND I THINK IT HAPPENS A LOT. IN OUR CURRENT SOCIETY LIKE COMPARING GENERATIONS AND LIKE PETTING GENERATIONS AGAINST EACH OTHER YOU KNOW YEAH WE'RE ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT GENERATIONS MISTER KALRA AN IRON MILLENNIALS. HEY YOU KNOW -- AND MISTER BERMAN ARE YOU QUITE. A LOT. CARE MEMBER IF YOU'RE IN THEIR LAN FATHER OF THE MILLENNIAL HE HE MENTIONED HE ALLUDED TO THIS MONEY ON THIS EARLIER. BUT YOU KNOW WE ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT GENERATIONS I HAVE RESPECT FOR EVERY GENERATION MY GRANDFATHER WAS IN WORLD WAR -- TWO YOU KNOW HE'S NINETY FOUR THIS YEAR AGAIN A LOT OF WISDOM FROM HIM -- YOU KNOW MY FATHER DURING THE VIETNAM WAR AND MY MOTHER AS WELL. YOUR BABY BOOMER GENERATION. LOT OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS COUNTRY TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW ONE HAS BETTER OR WORSE LIKE WE ALL HAVE HAD DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE DIFFERENCE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND EVERY GENERATION -- SO I REALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS ABOUT LIKE A GENERATIONAL. BATTLE AND I THINK REALLY GOT TO PUT THAT AWAY YOU KNOW -- WHAT I WOULD ASK THOSE JUST IS THIS IS QUESTION IS? IF THE ARGUMENT IS. AND I THINK IT'S IT'S A RATIONAL ARGUMENT TO MAKE IF THE ARGUMENT IS THAT. HIGH SCHOOLERS. YOUNG. YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THEN SEVENTEEN IS AN ARBITRARY NUMBER. BECAUSE WHY NOT GIVE IT TO ALL HIGH SCHOOLERS. WHO ARE WHO ARE FACING THESE ISSUES WHO ARE? YOU KNOW WHO CARE ABOUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES A AND AND REALLY ARE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION. YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES OF ISSUES THEY'RE THEY'RE CONSERVATIVES OR LIBERALS THERE AND MAYBE THEY DON'T CARE. YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW SO. YOU KNOW SEVENTEEN IS ARBITRARY. AND AND IF THE ARGUMENT TRULY IS THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOICE IN THIS REPUBLIC YOU'RE CORRECT SIR IT IS REPUBLIC -- BECAUSE WE ELECT OUR REPRESENTATIVES WHO THEN VOTE ON THESE ISSUES FOR US. WHY NOT THIRTEEN MIGHT LIKE I SAID MY DAUGHTER'S? THIRTEEN I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN I KNOW THAT WHEN THEY'RE THIRTEEN THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE ABLE THEY'LL BE READY TO VOTE. YOU KNOW -- AND SO WHY NOT. NOT ALL THE WAY UP IF THAT'S THE ARGUMENT ONE OF OPEN ALL THE WAY UP. THIS CHAIR MAYBE MY THROUGH YOU -- I HAVE TO TWO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS THAT WOULD LIKE TO PLEASE IF THE IF THROUGH. YOU'RE SO WHY WHY SHOULD YOU BE ON TITLE AND NOT A FRESH MISTER VICE CHAIR I THINK WE HEARD THE QUESTION YET THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER AND I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY THAT YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY GOOD REASONS WHY SEVENTEEN SHOULD BE THE AGE. FIRST IS THAT WE'RE TAKING OUR CIVICS CLASSES IN THEIR SENIOR YEARS WERE ACTUALLY LEARNING ABOUT GOVERNMENT AND I WE ACTUALLY I DID A PRE REGISTRATION DRIVE AT MY SCHOOL TO KIND OF FINISH UP OUR AP GOV. AND THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD WAY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET MORE INVOLVED IN CIVICS AND I THINK THAT IF WE COULD AND THE YEAR OF SENIOR YEAR WITH -- REGISTERING STUDENTS TO VOTE ON THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO SEND THEM OFF INTO OUR SOCIETY IN A WAY WHERE THEY CAN PARTICIPATE FULLY. THE SECOND IS THAT SEVENTEEN YOU CAN BE TRIED AS AN ADULT AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU CAN BE TRIED AS AN ADULT -- THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE AS WELL. THIRD IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE SEVENTEEN YOU'RE ALLOWED TO OPERATE HEAVY DANGEROUS MACHINERY AND YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DRIVE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR CAR AND SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES IN YOUR HANDS WE ARE SIXTEEN ALSO KNOW AT SIXTEEN YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR CAR. YOU'RE ONLY A DRY ALLOWED YOU LIVE ALONE IN YOUR CAR YES SIR. YEAH AND TO KIND OF ADD ON TO THAT GREAT POINTS. AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YOUR YOUR TAKING AN AP GOVERNMENT CLASS OR SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT CLASS SO. IT IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IT IN IN MY PERSONAL OPINION. CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND CIVIC EDUCATION IS NOT PLACED AS A PRIORITY BUT IF VOTING AGE OF SEVENTEEN AND HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR FOR VOTING IN OUR ELECTIONS THAT WOULD GO TO THE TOP OF THE PRIORITY LIST OF OUR GOVERNMENT CLASSES. AND THIS WOULD GIVE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO ARE SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD INVALUABLE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME ENGAGED OUR DEMOCRACY AND EVENTUALLY BECOME LIFELONG VOTERS BECAUSE ONCE YOU VOTE. AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YOUR FIRST SELECTION YOU ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO VOTE IN FUTURE ELECTIONS AND BECOME A LIFELONG VOTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS HOW WOULD YOU SAY IN THE EIGHTH GRADE. WE STUDY THE U. S. CONSTITUTION AND SO EIGHTH GRADERS BY THE TIME THEY'VE GRADUATED GRADING GOING INTO HIGH SCHOOL HAVE STUDIED R. U. S. CONSTITUTIONALLY SIR SUPPOSED -- TO AND HAVE THAT BACKGROUND IN OUR GOVERNMENT SO. SO THERE I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST SEVENTEEN THAT WE LEARNED CIVICS WE LEARN IT THROUGHOUT OUR EDUCATION SO YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT FOR FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS ALL -- AGAIN IT TO YOUR POINT ABOUT -- NOW WHAT WAS THE WHAT WAS YOUR SECOND POINT GO AHEAD. YEAH KNOW YOUR SECOND POINT ONE WAS ABOUT CIVIC CENTER RIGHT -- ONE WAS ABOUT CIVICS -- ABOUT BEING TRIED AS AN ADULT BUT WE ALSO OF THIS BODY AGAIN I YOU MAY BE HEARD ME EARLIER. THIS BODY IS SAID WE DON'T HOLD YOU TO THE SAME ACCOUNT IF YOU COMMIT A CRIME BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE THE JUSTIFICATION IS YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD ENOUGH JUDGMENT. IN THAT TIME YOUR BRAINS HAVE NOT DEVELOPED. WELL ENOUGH SO THE ARGUMENT WOULD SEEM TO BE AGAINST. GIVING YOU THE RIGHT TO VOTE I MEAN. THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS A POWERFUL THING RIGHT IT'S IT YOU DO HAVE LIFE AND DEATH AND HANDS YOU VOTE ON JUDGES WHO WILL MAKE THE DECISION TO SEND SOMEONE TO THE DEATH PENALTY YOU VOTE ON A GOVERNOR WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO PARDON. YES IT IS A SERIOUS OBLIGATION WAS HE LIKE YOU COULD MAKE. THAT THAT ARGUMENT. TO SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE OLDER. UNDER THAT LOGIC RIGHT I CAN ALSO UNDER THE SAME LOGIC SAY COULD BE. THIRTEEN SO WHY ARE YOU DEPRIVE IN THE REST OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL. PIERS OTHER RIGHT TO VOTE THANK THEN ONLY GIVEN IF. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO INTRODUCE THE AC IT EITHER I MEAN I I ACTUALLY RULES WHEN I WILL ACTUALLY MAKE YOU A I WILL ACTUALLY MAKE THAT AS A AS OF IF YOU'LL TAKE THAT AS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT. IS IT FRIENDLY YEAH. BUT IT. WHY NOT IF IF WE'RE GOING TO AGAIN THESE ARE ACA'S THEY ARE THESE ARE ACA'S WERE ASKING THE PUBLIC YES SIR RIGHT THAT THEIR ARGUMENT GETS MIDDLE TIME WE'RE JUST ASKING THE PUBLIC? DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THIS RIGHT TO VOTE SHOULD WE CHANGE IT. IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT MR MULLIN ALREADY HAS A BILL THAT IS AN INCREMENTAL CHANGE YOU CAN VOTE SEVENTEEN THE PRIMARY FOR GOING TO BE EIGHTEEN THE GENERAL RIGHT. WHY NOT GIVE THE VOTERS TO DIFFERENT CHOICES ON HIS INCREMENTAL CHANGE? AND THEN HAD A A CHOICE ABOUT SHOULD BE TRULY IN FRANCHISE. ALL THE USE. NOT JUST SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS BUT THOSE WHO ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL. IF THAT'S REALLY THE ARGUMENT. PUT THAT BEFORE THE VOTERS AND ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THAT CHOICE I WOULD MAKE DOES A FORMAL MEMON IF YOU WOULD TAKE IT. WE WILL ALL AT THE AUTHOR RESPONDED AS CLOSE THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE -- MR LOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU JUST VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE WE'VE EXHAUSTED THIS CONVERSATION AT IN THIS COMMITTEE TODAY BUT I THINK. OUR SEVEN KILLED HAVE SPOKEN VERY CLEARLY AS TO THE AMAZING POTENTIAL. OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS IN FACT WILL BE NOT ONE TO EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE POOL OF OPPORTUNITY TO THESE YOUNG INDIVIDUALS. JUST IMAGINE THE TRAJECTORY AND THE TYPE OF CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THEY'LL MAKE OUR SOCIETY. THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COME OUT OF THEIR DAILY LIVES SCHEDULED TO COME IN STATE CAPITOL AND TO ADVOCATE FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSUME THE BE ENGAGED THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF ELECTORATE AND CITIZENRY THAT WE WANT TO SEE. AND AGAIN PART OF THAT OTHER CONVERSATION AS THAT THIS ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WELL WITH pSIDES OUT IN FACT OUR JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS A VIETNAM VETERAN HIMSELF. WHO ARTICULATES BUT THE REASON WHY HE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN WITH PARENTAL CONSENT YOU CAN STILL SERVE FOR YOUR COUNTRY? IN THE SERVICE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WE WANT TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE OUR ELECTORATE AND OUR CITIZENRY AND WITH RESPECT OF TWENTY FIVE CO AUTHORS AND BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WITH OVER FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE -- WHICH I SUPPORTED LAST SAYS IN THE LAST SESSION WHEN IT WAS A CA -- TEN ALSO WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES -- FOR THEIR VERY ELOQUENT -- AND POISE PRESENTATIONS MUCH MORE ELOQUENT POISE THAN ANY OF US ON THE DAIS OTHER THAN DOCTOR WEBER.

WE DO APPRECIATE IT'S A SIR YOU HAVE TO BILLS UP -- LET AND LET YOU. TO DETERMINE WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO PRESENT FIRST. WE'LL JUST GO AHEAD WITH SP ONE THIRTY NINE LET'S DO IT. OKAY SO THIS BILL. HI HAS TO DO WITH THAT REDISTRICTING. AND IT REQUIRES HI. COUNTIES OVER A CERTAIN SIZE TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT HISTORY COMMISSION. WHICH ENSURE MORE FAIR NONPARTISAN SYSTEM FOR DRAWING THE LINES OF COUNTY. SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICTS MEMBERS. ALL OF US WERE ELECTED FROM DISTRICTS. BASED ON LINES THAT WERE DRAWN BY INDEPENDENT ADDITION COMMISSIONS IN. IT'S REALLY MUCH MORE FAIR AND TRANSPARENT IN THE PROCESS THAT USED TO EXIST WHERE. THE INCUMBENTS WERE DRAWN THEIR ALLIANCE. WE WANT. TO PUT A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN PLACE FOR LARGE COUNTIES. SO AS TO ENSURE FOR A FAIR PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT. WITH ME TODAY I'VE GOT NICOLAS I DON'T WHOSE FROM COMMON CAUSE AND ALSO DOOR ROSE FROM LEGAL IN THE VOTERS [inaudible] PLEASE. CHAIR BERMAN MEMBERS NICOLAS HAD ON REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA COME BECAUSE VERY PROUD CO SPONSORS BE ONE THIRTY NINE TO ENSURE FAIR AND INDEPENDENT COUNTY RETESTING -- PROCESS AND CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTIES. GERRYMANDERING OF COURSE HAS NO PLACE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AT ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. GERRYMANDERING HARMS PUBLIC TRUST IN FAIRNESS FOR PROCESS UNDERMINES REPRESENT OF NATURE OF OUR GOVERNMENT. AND PRIVATE VOTERS OF THEIR ABILITY TO HOLD ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS WHEN IT COMES TO STATE IN CONGRESSIONAL REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE TO ELIMINATE GERRYMANDERING. CALIFORNIA STATE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WHICH MOVES FROM THE PROCESSING COMMENTS WITH NO ELECTORAL SELF INTEREST IN HOW LINES ARE DRAWN. IS CONSIDERED THE NATIONAL GOLD STANDARD FOR REFORM BY ACADEMICS AS WELL AS REFORMERS. THIS BILL STANDS AT A PRACTICE AND BEEN A REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTIES LIKE THE STATE COMMISSION SB ONE THIRTY NINE REQUIRES COMMISSIONERS TO MEET STRICT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE PRINTING RECENT CAN IT'S LOBBYIST FOR MAJOR DONORS FROM SERVING ON THE COMMISSION. CREATES A RANDOM SELECTION PROCESS MUCH LIKE A JURY TO ENSURE THE COMMISSIONERS AND UP HOLDEN TEN ELECTED OFFICIAL. THE CARD IS A COUNTY TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO ENSURE THE COMMISSION REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF THE JURISDICTION. REQUIRES THE COMMISSION ACT TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENTLY EXCUSE ME HOLD MULTIPLE HEARINGS FOR MASS CAN BE ADOPTED. AND PROHIBITS PARTISAN AND PRONE COMING GERRYMANDERING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL FOR THE FIRST TIME. INDEPENDENT REDUCING IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE LEADS MORE REPRESENT ABOUT COMES AND PROMOTES TRUST IN FAIRNESS IN THE PROCESS. CITIES A COMMISSIONS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA STATE COMMISSION CONSISTENTLY SO THEY DO A BETTER JOB TRYING MAPS KEEP COMMUNITIES HOLE SPECIALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND ARE FAIR TO POLITICAL PARTIES. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WERE VERY STRONG -- STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND WE URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MORE LASER MERIT MORMON MEMBERS -- DOOR ROSE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS ALSO CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY -- OUR ARE THE STATELY HELPED LEAD THE FIGHT FOR INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION AT THE STATE LEVEL IN OUR LOCAL LEAGUES HELPFULLY THE MOVEMENT FOR INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN CITIES AND COUNTIES AND WHERE IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. AT THEY ARE IN THE TRENCHES THERE IN THE TRENCHES TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS THAT IS REALLY MEANINGFUL ROBUST PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THE PARTICIPATION IS DIVERSE. AND THAT THE COMMISSIONERS THAT ARE CHOSEN REPRESENTED REFLECT THE DIVERSITY THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE COMING FROM -- AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE DO ALL OF THAT BECAUSE OF FAIR INCLUSIVE LINE DRAWING IS REALLY CORD TO GOOD GOVERNMENT. UP WITH A LEGISLATIVE BODY DRAWS ITS OWN LINES THERE IS NOTHING SORT OF BY NECESSITY A TEMPTATION TO DRAW THEM IN SUCH A WAY AS TO HELP OR HURT INCUMBENTS ARE OR POTENTIAL NEW MEMBERS TO THE BODY. OR TO PRESERVE POLITICAL POWER IN ONE PARTY. THESE ARE NOT ABSTRACT CONCERNS WE'RE SEEING THEM WE SEEN THEM ALL TOO OFTEN SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS TIME TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP. TO REQUIRE INDEPENDENT. COMMISSIONS IN LARGE COUNTIES. FOR REDISTRICTING ON COUNTY SUPERVISOR OF DISTRICTS TO BUILD A TRANSPARENCY INTO THAT PROCESS AS YOU KNOW VOTERS WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO OTE SOMEBODY IN WHO REFLECTS OUR COMMUNITIES INTERESTS AT LEAST A SHOT AT IT THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT ELECTIONS ARE CLEAN AND FAIR. AND THIS IS A BIG PART OF THAT WE ARE A MAJORITY MINORITY STATE. BUT THAT DIVERSITY IS WOEFULLY UNDERREPRESENTED AMONG OUR COUNTY SUPERVISORS -- IN ONE STUDY IN THE LAST STUDY WHILE X. THAT'S STUDY SHOWED THAT ONLY OF OUR COUNTY SUPERVISORS ARE LATINO X. CLEARLY A BIG PROBLEM WITH UNDER REPRESENTATION SO BY FIXING THE WAY THAT WE DRAW THESE DISTRICT LINES. WE'RE GONNA BE STE ONE STEP CLOSER TO A TRULY REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF OUR LAWS ARE MOVING TOWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- JIM WINBERG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION TO CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT AND I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO PASS LONG THE SUPPORT OF VOICES FOR PROGRESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

A JEFF NEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WONDER WHAT THANK THE AUTHOR IN OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE BROUGHT UP -- ON THE SENATE SIDE. YOUR MAIN REMAINING CONCERN IS IS REALLY AROUND FUNDING -- WHILE IT MIGHT SEEM. INCONSEQUENTIAL AND IN AS REGARDS TO THE POLICY INVOLVED -- IT MIGHT BE HARD TO BELIEVE BUT THREE OUT OF FOUR COUNTIES ACTUALLY STILL HAVE LESS DISCRETIONARY REVENUE NOW -- ON A PER CAPITA BASIS IN REAL TERMS THAN THEY DID BEFORE THE RECESSION AND THEY'RE A LOT OF BILLS IN THIS SECTION THE PUT NEW REQUIREMENTS ON ON COUNTIES -- WITHOUT ANY ANY FUNDING ATTACHED TO IT SO WHAT THE STATE IS ENJOINED RECORD -- BUDGET SURPLUSES. THAT THREE OUT OF FOUR COUNTIES ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO RETURN JUST TO THEIR PRE RECESSION A REVENUE LEVELS SO -- WE JUST AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH SOME RATHER CONCERNS BUT THE FUNDING ISSUE IS IS A REAL ONE AND WANTED TO PASS ALONG.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU -- THIS IS A FACTUAL POINT -- I THINK BELIEVE THE POINT WAS A STATISTICAL DATA POINT ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF LAND NEXT PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA VERSES THE PERCENTAGE OF LIVE NEXT PEOPLE WHO ARE ELECTED TO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- SO IS A SYNOPSIS OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY CORRECT THERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS -- I ENCOURAGE YOU TO USE IS THAT CORRECT.

THIS ODD CAME TO MY MIND BECAUSE WE HAD A SITUATION LESS ANGELES WHERE WE WERE HAVING THERE'S A CERTAIN PORTION OF LA THAT WAS HAVING AN ELECTION EVERY MONTH -- THEY HAD A CITY COUNCIL READ ELECTION IN A AND THEN AND THEN THEY HAD A SPECIAL FOR THE FOR FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL SEAT THAT HAVE EVER SERRA HAD HAD VACATED THEN THERE WAS IT. THE GENERAL THEN THEN THEY HAD TO DO. THERE IS A CITY COUNCIL AND THE SCHOOL BOARD AND THEN AGAIN ASSEMBLY TWO ROUNDS OF ASSEMBLY IT JUST CRAZY AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE WANT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE RULES WERE WRITTEN. ON THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY IN THE CALENDARING TO ALLOW FOR CONSOLIDATION. SO THIS JUST GIVES A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY I WANTED ALSO KIND OF EXPANDED OUT TO MAKE IT SO THAT THE ELECTION COULD BE DECLARED EARLIER BUT WE WE GOT A LOT OF CONCERNS FROM OUR CLERKS AND OTHERS -- BUT I IN YOU THE DAY THIS GIVES A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY SO AS TO ALLOW FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE COHERENCE. TO TO TO THE SPECIAL ACTIONS THAT ARE CALLED. AND WITHOUT A RESPECT YESTERDAY VOTE. THE CENTER WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS A CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S SO YOU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SING NINE BRING IT BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER VICE CHAIR YEAH SO I MEAN YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE TO TWO HUNDRED DAYS NOW LIKE I MEAN. HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE IS THAT GONNA MAKE LIKE IN THE INSTANCE OF YOUR? YOUR YOUR QUANDARY IN LA COUNTY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED FROM FOR ONE CONSOLIDATION IN THAT CASE -- SO YEAH IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE MOST EARTH SHATTERING BILL BUT IF IT SAVES. I BOTH THE TAXPAYERS -- THE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE ADDITIONAL SPECIAL ELECTION NEEDLESSLY -- THAT CAN ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE TURN OUT FROM. MAYBE. 7% 212%. I THINK IT WILL HAVE BEEN WORTHWHILE AND FOR AN INDIAN THE ONLY OTHER CONCERN THAT. IS THE OTHER THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS WHEN WE LOSE WHEN WE HAVE A VACANCY WE WANT TO TRYING TO GET. SOMEONE IN THAT SEAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND AND SOMETIMES THESE THINGS GET DRAGGED OUT. A WHILE RIGHT AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER CONCERN I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU AND IT IS MY CONCERN AS WELL. YOU KNOW THAT THE MOST THIS ONLY EXTENDS ABOUT TWENTY DAYS -- AND I THINK THE PUBLIC POLICY ADVANTAGES ASSOCIATED WITH SAVING THE COST OF ANOTHER ELECTION -- WAYS THE TWENTY DAYS -- BUT YOU THIS IS NOT -- THE MOST GROUNDBREAKING BILL THAT I'VE EVER RUN BUT I I DO I BUT I REALLY DO I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AND I THINK I THINK THE THAT'S WHAT WE HAD. YEAH THIRTY SEVEN ZERO VOTE OVER THE SENATE SIDE -- THIRTY SEVEN TO ZERO YEAH THAT'S OUT OF FORTY INTO OR OUT OF THIRTY NINE THAT'S RIGHT THIRTY EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT WHO KNOWS MAKING SURE COMMITTEE MEMBERS REALIZE YEAH YEAH. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AS RIGHT SEEING NONE OF THIS IS SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I I DO APPRECIATE. YOUR CONSIDERATION LISTEN AND RESTRAINT YOU THE CENTER IN LIGHT OF THE HIGH COST OF HOLDING SPECIAL VACANCY ELECTIONS IN THE LOW VOTER. PARTICIPATION THAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT SPECIAL ELECTIONS IT IS SENSIBLE TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO ENCOURAGE THE CONSOLIDATION IN SPECIAL ELECTIONS WITH OTHER SCHEDULED ELECTIONS THIS BILL PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY THAT CAN RESULT IN A LARGER NUMBER SPECIAL ELECTIONS BEING CONSOLIDATED. WITH OTHER ELECTIONS FOR THAT REASON I'M HAPPY TO RECOMMEND SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU MISTER MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BERMAN HI BERMAN I'D GALLAGHER.

HI THE SECTOR A STATE IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THOSE ITEMS WOULD BE REJECTED ON THE SECOND TATE'S WHAT SECRETARY OF STATE'S WEBSITE. AND IT WOULD REQUIRE ALL PARTIES. TO TAKE PART WITHIN THE BILL.

THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'M RICHARD WINGER WITH THE BALLOT. THEY GO BALLOT ACCESS NEWS AND ALSO THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY. THIS BILL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER BOTH THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS. WHEN I TESTIFIED AGAINST HIS BILL IN THE SENATE I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE STATE CONSTITUTION? BUT THE STATE CONSTITUTION IS QUITE SIMPLE. THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL. PUT RECOGNIZE CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. THE SECRETARY OF STATE DOES NOT HAVE UNBRIDLED DISCRETION TO DECIDE WHO IS RECOGNIZED. ARMS TO PASS -- LAROUCHE VERSUS YOU HAS THAT BEEN DONE. I DON'T KNOW SO MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE. YEP WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW THANK YOU IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO MRS YOU KEPT -- LYNDON LAROUCHE OFF THE BALLOT SHE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS RECOGNIZED AS THE WORD. AND THE COURT DISAGREED THEY SAID LOOK HE'S ON THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY BALLOT OF TWENTY ONE OTHER STATES. HE'S BEEN ON THE CALIFORNIA PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY BALLOT BEFORE. HE'S OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED AND SO THAT'S THE SIXERS STATE JUST CANNOT SAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT A RECOGNIZED CANDIDATE. AND I WON'T GO ON ABOUT THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION. BUT I'LL JUST SAY A ONE MORE THING THERE FIFTEEN STATES. WHERE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR? AND NO OTHER ONE OF THOSE STATES HAS PASSED THIS KIND OF A BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. HI MY NAME IS CALLING BRITAIN. OF I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ONE THIS BILL APPEARS TO BE TOTALLY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. IT SEEMS TO BE TARGETED AGAINST A SINGLE CANDIDATE. IT IS AIMED AT SUPPRESSING VOTE OF OPPOSITION CANDIDATES IS AGAINST EVERY ACT OF TRANSPARENCY AND INCLUSIVENESS THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS. CONGRESS -- THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY PURPORTS TO SUPPORT SO -- IS BENEATH YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MY NAME IS ROLE RODRIGUEZ JUNIOR. AND I'M HERE AS A CALIFORNIA COORDINATOR FOR AMERICA FIRST LATINOS TO ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON SB TWENTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT WILL. DISENFRANCHISE CALIFORNIA LATINOS BY UNLAWFULLY DEPRIVING A PROTECTED CLASS FROM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE LIBERTY AND FREEDOM TO VOTE. FOR DONALD J. TRUMP. FURTHERMORE SB TWENTY SEVEN IS A POLL TAX. I'M ALSO HERE AT SOMEONE WHO RAN IN THE LAST ELECTION. FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T WIN I GOT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND VOTES. FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN VETOED AN IDENTICAL BILL. SB ONE FORTY NINE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE QUESTIONED THE TACTICS BEHIND A NEW BALLAD QUALIFYING REQUIREMENT. WHICH IS A DEFINITION BI. DEFINITION A POLL TAX. BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO SINGLE OUT CANDIDATES THAT HAVE A DIFFERENT VISION. OF GOVERNING NOT TO MENTION. IT DISREGARDS THE CIVIL RIGHTS. A BOTH THE CANDIDATES. AND THOSE. WHO ARE VOTING? IN CALIFORNIA IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO DO VIEWPOINT DISCRIMINATION. WE THINK SB TWENTY SEVEN IS. DISCRIMINATION. BECAUSE IT SUDDENLY REQUIRES FINANCIAL TAX FILINGS UNDER THE FATE REASON. OF MORE TRANSPARENCY IN AND INFORMATION WHEN IN REALITY. WE LIVE IN. AN ERA OF THE INTERNET. WHERE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO FIND OUT ANYTHING GENERALLY CAN? SO THIS FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO GIVE MORE INFORMATION IS JUST SMOKE AND MIRRORS. AND QUITE FRANKLY SB TWENTY SEVEN SPOUSE LIKE A DIFFERENT VERSION OF A POLL TAX. PLEASE VOTE NO ON AS HE TWENTY SEVEN FOR ANYONE WATCHING THIS. HEARING THIS PHONE NUMBER IS FOUR IN. FOR REPORTING CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND IN FINISH IN FINISHING MY STATE MAN. THERE ARE QUALIFICATION FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ARTICLE TWO OF THE CONSTITUTION SECTION. ONE CLAUSE FIVE OF THE CONSTITUTION. SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT MUST NUMBER. ONE BEING A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN AND NUMBER TO BE AT LEAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE. AND NUMBER. THREE HAVE LIVED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. FOR AT LEAST FOURTEEN YEARS THOSE ARE THE ONLY QUALIFICATIONS FOR A PRESIDENT. SO WHATEVER ELSE IS GOING ON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS. A BLATANT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. THANK YOU SIR. EXCUSE ME. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE LATITUDE FOR OF ALL THESE PRESENTATIONS -- I'M SIMPLY GOING TO READ FROM ON THE SHEET OF PAPER SO IT CAN BE MORE SUCCINCT IN IN SHORT IF I MAY. UP MY NAME IS STILL IN MAY AND I'M HERE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CONCERNED CITIZENS THE CALIFORNIA. DIVORCE OUR OBJECTIONS TO SB TWENTY SEVEN IN ITS ATTEMPT TO DEPRIVED CALIFORNIA CITIZENS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR A DULY QUALIFIED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. ABSENT AND NEW UNLAWFUL AND FRAUDULENT ELIGIBILITY QUALIFICATION BEYOND THAT WHICH IS PRESCRIBED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN VETOED SB ONE FORTY NINE IDENTICAL BILL WARNING QUOTE. WHAT WOULD BE NEXT FIVE YEARS OF HEALTH RECORDS A CERTIFIED BIRTH CERTIFICATE AT CETERA? DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF LAW UNDER EIGHTEEN USC SECTION TWO FORTY TWO MAKES IT A CRIME TO WILLFULLY DEPRIVE A PERSON OF A RIGHT OR PRIVILEGE PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION OR U. S. LAWS. AND INCLUDES ACTS DONE BY THE STATE OFFICIALS THE CRIME OF WHICH INCLUDES FINES OR IMPRISONMENT OR BOTH. THEN THERE'S ARTICLE ONE OF THE US CONSTITUTION WHICH SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS THE PASSING OF ANY FORM OF BILLS OF ATTAINDER BY BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES BECAUSE THEY NOTIFY THE TARGETED PERSON CIVIL RIGHTS. IN US VERSUS LOVETT SCOTUS OPINED THAT CONGRESS HAD EXCEEDED ITS POWER WHEN IT ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT DISQUALIFIED PEOPLE FROM POSITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT I. E.. THEY CREATED A BILL OF ATTAINDER. IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE US SUPREME COURT AGAIN ADDRESS THE BILL OF ATTAINDER CLAUSE IN US THE BROWN. SPECIFICALLY REJECTED A NARROW HISTORICAL PRO WHICH IN A PINE TO PROHIBIT QUOTE LEGISLATIVE PUNISHMENT OF ANY FORM OR SEVERITY AND QUOTE. AS SPECIFIED IN USB BROWN AND IN OPPOSITION TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS POSITION. SCOTUS HELD THAT EXCLUSION FROM APPOINTMENT IS A FORM OF AND THEREFORE SB TWENTY SEVEN WILL CERTAINLY DEPRIVE ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. FROM THE OPPORTUNITY OF EMPLOYMENT IF THEY DON'T SUBMIT TO YOUR NEW TAX RETURN QUALIFIER BUST. SB TWENTY SEVEN VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS IN OTHER LAWS AS WELL AS NUMEROUS PROTECTIONS DEFINED WITHIN THE US CONSTITUTION. NOW FOR THE TWO OF YOU HOLD LAWS AGREES PRESUMABLY YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE AFTER MENTIONED LAWS. AND PROTECTIONS THE OTHERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BY VOTING TO APPROVE SB TWENTY SEVEN TODAY. YOU PERSONALLY -- WILL BE VIOLATING EIGHTEEN USC SECTION TWO FORTY TWO AND SUBJECT TO FINES AND OR IMPRISONMENT BY VOTING YES. UNDER COLOR OF LAW IN AUTHORITY SO WE STRONGLY ASK YOU. TO VOTE NO ON SB TWENTY SEVEN OF FOR ALL THE AFOREMENTIONED REASONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BRING IT BACK EXCUSE ME -- SING ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OPPOSITION. MY NAME'S GREG GALLON I WANT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT THANK YOU SIR. I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO ON THE BILL. I THINK THE ENTIRE NATION WILL SEE THIS IS AN ATTEMPT.

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS IT MAKES CALIFORNIA LOOK LIKE A RIG STATE I'M SORRY FROM A TOTALLY OPPOSE AGAINST US THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GINA BELLA THE REMEMBRANCE PROJECT.

THANK YOU IF YOU CAN PLEASE KEEP IT TO YOUR NAME AT THE ORGANIZATION YOU REPRESENT YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL THAT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE MORE THAN FOUR AND A HALF MILLION. CALIFORNIANS WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP DON'T DISCRIMINATE US VOTE NO TO THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM. BRING IT BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I'M GONNA GO THAT THIS ONE NUMBER MAYES AN INVESTOR GALLAGHER AND THEN ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] PLEASE -- MAN I WISH I COULD SUPPORT THIS TODAY -- BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SOMEBODY RUNNING FOR THE PRESENT PRESIDENCY. AT TO BE ABLE TO DISCLOSE THEIR FINANCIAL RECORDS WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN -- DISCLOSURES -- WE HAVE OUR OWN DISCLOSURES WE WE HAVE HERE BUT THE THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY. IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT CONFLICTS MIGHT BE MIGHT BE THERE THE ONLY WAY TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT IS WITHIN. OF THOSE READ THOSE RETURNS -- SIR OUTSIDE INTERRUPT I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO KEEP THAT SIGN DOWN IT WE I I'VE ALLOW THE SIGNS WHICH WE NORMALLY WOULDN'T ALLOW AT ALL BUT I'M GONNA ASK. YEAH BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT WE HAVE RULES IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT I'M GONNA ASK YOU NOT TO TRY TO BLOCK OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SIGN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER MISS I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO -- I DO WISH THAT THE THAT OUR PRESIDENT MOM BUT WHATEVER LEASES TAX RETURNS I THINK IT'S CREATED -- TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY AND AND THIS THOUGHT THAT SOMEHOW THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING IN THERE THAT -- THAT THAT HE WANTS TO KEEP HIDDEN SO I I WISH THAT HE WOULD -- MY QUESTION -- IS THOUGH I HAVE THIS BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ACTUALLY ASKED LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. OF FOR A BRIEF ON THIS AND I DON'T TO READ THROUGH ALL OF IT-- BUT THEY THERE'S A CASE CALLED THORTON -- THAT -- THEY HAD USED AFFECT I'VE LOST MY I LOST IT HERE YOU HAVE IT YEAH. HERE IT IS SAYS -- TWO POINT THREE IS WHAT THIS IS AND AND THEIR FATHER THEY GAVE IS -- AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WE CONCLUDE THAT A COURT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT FIND IT SB ONE FOUR NINE HANDICAPS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES REFUSE DISCLOSURE TAX RETURNS. AND IT APPEARS TO HAVE THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A QUALIFICATION INDIRECTLY NAY GOES ON TO SAY THAT -- THAT THE QUALITY QUALIFICATIONS CLAUSE THE CONSTITUTION IT WOULDN'T BE MET I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS WAS VETOED BY THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT AND AND IT WOULD MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE FOR US TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS HERE IF -- IF THIS ENDED UP GOING THROUGH THE COURTS IN IT BEING -- RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL NO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ISN'T A MEMBER AND THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR -- IN THROUGH COMMITTING PRESS FOR THIS ONE SAY. THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND I THINK THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE -- ISSUES AND OPINIONS ON ALL SIDES. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. POLL AFTER POLL SHOWS THAT NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS WANT THE PRESIDENT NOT JUST PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD A RELEASED HIS OR HER TAX RETURNS. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF LEGAL OPINIONS. ON THIS ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO BE TO TALK TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE BILL -- AND THEN ALSO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SCHOLARS WHO HAVE LOOKED AT THIS BILL. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE IT STATES HAVE THE ABILITY ON BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS OR WE DO NOT. SO IT'S VERY CLEAR WHERE THE CITY CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS. IT WOULD BE -- INCLUDING RELEASING YOUR TAX RETURNS BECAUSE IT'S NOT TARGETED TO ONE INDIVIDUAL. OR ONE CANDID. IF IT IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. IN IN THIS BILL IT'S ONLY FOCUS ON THE MARCH PRIMARY. THE REASON WHY IT'S FOLKS IN THE MARCH PRIMARY BECAUSE STATES HAVE FULL AUTHORITY CALIFORNIA PER CONSTITUTION HAS FULL AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO IMPOSE. BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS IN OUR PRIMARY. WE DO NOT IN THE GENERAL BECAUSE THAT'S UP TO THE POLITICAL PARTY. WHETHER IT'S THE REPUBLICANS THE DEMOCRATS THE GREENS LIBERTARIANS YOU NAME. AND IT IS IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION. LET'S DEFINE ABOUT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS. SIGNATURE GATHERER REQUIREMENTS FILING FEES TO MIDDLE DEADLINES FOR THE SECRETARY STATE. AND RELEASING YOUR TAX RETURNS. WE HAVE LANGUAGE WITHIN THE BILL THIS IS IF YOU DO NOT PAY TAXES YOU CAN STILL GET ON THE BALLOT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO FILE FORM DISSECTOR STATES OFFICE. IN YOUR NAME APPEAR ON THE BALLOT. IF YOU DON'T FILE TAXES. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THERE ARE THREE DEMOCRATS THUS FAR THEY HAVE NOT SHARED THEIR TAX RETURNS FOR THE PUBLIC. THOSE THREE WOULD NOT APPEAR ON THE MARCH PRIMARY BALLOT. ALONG AND IF HE CHOOSES PRESIDENT TRUMP -- AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS PAST FORTY YEARS. EVERY PRESIDENT. REPUBLICAN DEMOCRATIC LIKE. HAVE RELEASE OUR TAX RETURNS. THIS BILL HAS BEEN LOOKED AT BY THE FORMER ETHICS ATTORNEY FOR GEORGE W. BUSH. THE FORMER ETHICS ATTORNEY FOR BARACK OBAMA AS WELL AS LAWRENCE TRIBE. ALL BELIEVE AT THIS WALL WITH PAINT WITH A STAND A CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT. NOW. WILL THIS BE CHALLENGED IN COURT YOU'RE RIGHT IT WILL BE. AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE CHALLENGED IN COURT. BECAUSE NO MATTER IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT OR YOU'RE REPUBLICAN. YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR NATION BEFORE YOUR POLITICS IN YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS. IN HAS RELEASING OF TAX RETURNS IN THE PAST BECAUSE CHALLENGES FOR THOSE WHO RUN FOR OFFICE YOU'RE RIGHT IT HAS. BUT INCOME TAX RETURNS AS MISTER MESA JUST SAID NO PARAPHRASING HERE PROVIDE VOTERS WITH ESSENTIAL INFORMATION REGARDING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DEALINGS FINANCIAL STATUS. IN CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND WHEN YOU ARE IN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATE WHEN YOU'RE THE PRESENT UNITED STATES YOU ARE ALSO THERE'S ONLY TWO OFFICES IN THE LAND THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST LIES. THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT ALL OF US WHOARE SITTING HERE TODAY ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST LIES. IF YOU SIT ON THE SAN JOSE CITY COUNCIL. THE SACRAMENTO CITY COUNCIL THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR SCHOOL BOARD YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE MORE INFORMATION COMPLICATED INFORMATION ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST INFORMATION. AS A LOCAL ELECTED A MEMBER OF THE SCHOOL BOARD ANY DO AS PRESIDENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BECAUSE YOU'RE SUBJECT TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAWS. SO I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WITHSTAND ACOSTA SHORTENING THERE ARE GOING TO BE ATTORNEYS OUT THERE THAT SAY THAT WE WON'T -- AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BE TESTED IN THE COURTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF I JUST CANDICE TO THE FOLLOW UP. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THIS BEING A PARTISAN ISSUE IN FACT I EVEN IN THIS COMMITTEE I DON'T LIKE THE FACT WE TALK ABOUT BEING REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT -- WE THE THE GOAL HERE IS TO TRY TO CREATE A SOME RULES THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO TO TO ABIDE BY. WHAT IS DISTURBING TO ME IS THAT IF THE? IF THE SHE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT AND WE HAD A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT WHO WOULD NOT RELEASE IS RETURNS -- I CAN TELL YOU THERE'D BE OUTRAGE -- AMONG SPOKES ON ON THE RIGHT. AND SO THE THE ISSUE IS THE PRESENT SHE RELEASES TAX RETURNS -- THE QUESTION FOR ME IS WHETHER THIS IS CONSTITUTIONAL OR NOT -- AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ME -- BUT THE FIVE IF IF THOSE FOLKS BACK IN WASHINGTON DC WERE WATCHING -- I THINK WE ALL AS AMERICANS IS CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENT I'D STATE SHOULD RELEASES RETURNS. IF IT'S OKAY WITH FUTURE WHAT I WOULD SAY AND THE IN I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS IN THEIR BRING THAT FORWARD. WE HEARD A LOT OF FEEDBACK. ABOUT PARTISANSHIP. THAT'S WHY WE'RE BACKING FUNNY TODAY INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA. BY THE WAY THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA HAS LEAD BY EXAMPLE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. RELEASE THE SAME INFORMATION THAT IS READ THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED OF ANY PRESIDENT UNDER THIS BILL. SO NOW REQUIRED IN THIS BILL WOULD BE THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GAVIN NEWSOM [inaudible] PRESIDENT TRUMP. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD WON THIS RACE. OUT WE WOULD BE HERE PRESENTING THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT SETTING SIGN YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS AND BEING A PATRIOT. IN BEING TRANSPARENT IN RELEASING YOUR RETURNS AND BY THE WAY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON OUR SIDE ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR. YES SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WE WORKED A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER HE TO YOU KNOW. YEAH I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS IN A VACUUM YOU KNOW -- AND EVEN WITHOUT IN THE GOVERNOR IT LIKE IT THE CONTEXT OF WAR AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON ONLY PER ONE PRESIDENT WHO HASN'T RELEASED. HIS TAX RETURNS RIGHT AND SO IT LOOKS VERY POLITICAL AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S AN EVEN HANDED APPROACH -- AND I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM LIKE IF YOU IF YOU WERE DOING THIS IN A CONTEXT WHERE -- YELLED ALL ALL -- ALL ALL CANDIDATES HAD. RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS OR ALL CANDIDATES HAD RELEASE OUR TAX RETURNS THAT THAT MIGHT BE ONE THING -- BUT WE'RE OBVIOUSLY OPERATE IN A CONTEXT THAT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO GET TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BY A COURT ABSOLUTELY -- I ALSO THINK LIKE WERE ALSO IN THIS CONTEXT OF TALKING ABOUT PRIVACY. AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AND HOW WE DON'T WANT YOU KNOW OUR PRIVACY. AS CONSUMERS AS CONSUMERS CERTAINLY WHEN OUR PEOPLE SIGN OUR INFORMATION WITHOUT OUR CONSENT. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE GIVE UP ALL SENSE OF PRIVACY AS PEOPLE WHO ARE PUBLIC FIGURES WE DON'T GIVE UP ALL SENSE OF PRIVACY. WHEN WE RUN FOR OFFICE -- ALL OF US DO FILE STATEMENTS OF ECONOMIC INTEREST. SO DO THE FEDERAL CANDIDATES AS WELL SO EVERYBODY CAN SEE WHAT THEY HAVE INTEREST IN -- BUT TO ME MA'AM MY TAX RETURNS OR NOBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS PERIOD. AND I'M NOT GOING TO REQUIRE OF SOMEBODY ELSE SOMETHING I WOULDN'T EXPECT. OF MYSELF -- AND CERTAINLY I I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PROBLEMS APPEAR RELEASING YOUR PRIVATE TAX RETURNS -- OF TALKING ABOUT WHAT DEDUCTIONS YOU'VE TAKEN AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'VE MADE I MEAN I TO ME THAT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS -- YES PRESIDENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY DONE THAT THAT'S A TRADITION NOW IT'S NOT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT. AND THEN LASTLY WE TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT THIS COMMITTEE VOTER SUPPRESSION. THIS WOULD CAUSE VOTER SUPPRESSION IF YOU HAVE. LOOKED DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE THE REPUBLICAN. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OKAY -- HE'S GONNA BE ON THE BALLOT IF IF IN MARCH. BECAUSE OF THIS PROVISION HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO BE ON THE BALLOT IT'S GOING TO MEAN THAT REPUBLICAN VOTERS HAVE NO NO REASON TO TURN OUT. WHICH WHICH AFFECTS EVERY DOWN BALLOT RACE. AM IN IS A HUGE VOTE AND IF IT WERE IF THE SHOE WERE ON THE OTHER FOOT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE BE SAYING THE SAME THING. BECAUSE IT WOULD SUPPRESS DEMOCRATIC TURN OUT -- AS WELL AND SO AND AND LOOK I MEAN IF. TO YOUR POINT IF LET'S SAY JOE BIDEN DECIDES NOT TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS IS NOT ON THE BALLOT IT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SHOW UP FOR JOE BIDEN. WHO WON'T -- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THE CANDIDATE THAT THEY SEE IS IS BEST FOR PRESIDENT SO LOOK I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT THIS. IN A BALANCED WAY AND AND AND VOTE NO ON THIS ON THIS PROPOSAL AND IN THE FUTURE WE CAN TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO CANDIDATES BUT I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT IT JUST REALLY LOOKS. OVERLY POLITICAL AND I THINK IT COULD HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE RESULT ON VOTER TURNOUT. IN MARCH SO THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE. THIS IS JUST BEING CANDID WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE SEEN THIS LEGISLATURE. THE BIGGEST TURN OUT FOR DEMOCRATS. IS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. HE'S THE BIGGEST ORGANIZER FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE'RE SEEN RECORD NUMBERS OF DEMOCRATS TURNING UP BECAUSE A PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. IF THIS WAS ABOUT VOTER SUPPRESSION WE'D HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP ON EVERY FLIPPIN BALLOT WE COULD HEAR IN CALIFORNIA -- TRULY. I THAT'S THE GOD HONEST TRUTH. SO THIS IS ABOUT. I SO THIS IS IT THIS IS ABOUT BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA THIS IS ABOUT PUTTING THE INTERESTS OF YOUR COUNTRY FIRST AND I THINK WE NEED TO FLIP THIS DISCUSSION. FORTY YEARS WE'VE HAD FORTY YEARS OF EVERY PRESIDENT. REAGAN. CARTER BOTH BUSHES REALLY SIR TAX RETURNS SO THAT THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS WHAT IS THE INDIVIDUAL HAVE TO HIDE -- END IT IS VERY CLEAR. THAT THIS IS TARGETED TARGETED. IN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO ALL CANDIDATES AND WE HAVE THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON THIS BILL. HE IS IN THE BILL HE IS ALREADY LEAD BY EXAMPLE. AND THAT'S WHAT THE FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED FROM MEMBERS FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND BY THE WAY I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MISTER GALLAGHER LOVE WORKING WITH THEM ON ALL ISSUES OF FAR RECOVERY. LOW EMISSION MAYES -- IN I WOULD SAY THOUGH IS THAT WE HAVE LISTENED TO FEEDBACK AND THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE THE GOVERNOR WHO IS LEAD BY EXAMPLE IN THIS BILL THANK YOU CENTER. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BECAUSE NO YOU CANNOT SIR. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND COLLEAGUES. NEW DOCTOR WEBER -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS SO TRUE THAT IF OF SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT EVERYBODY WOULD BE DEMANDING TRANSPARENCY. I COULD NEVER IMAGINE OBAMA NOT TURNING OVER HIS TAX RETURNS. AND EVEN WITH THAT EVEN HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE. REQUIRED STEEL CONSTANT QUESTIONS AND CHALLENGES TO HIS QUALIFICATIONS AS A PERSON WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT SO AND WHAT. SO I THINK IT IT YOU KNOW IT IT'S IT'S SHOCKING TO ME THAT OUT. THAT AFTER ALL THIS TIME WE'RE STILL GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE OF UNDERSTAND WHETHER THERE'S FINANCIAL CONFLICT IN THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IS THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HAS AS WE HAVE SEEN HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO DO GOOD THINGS AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE HARM. AND AND WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO VOTE FOR HIM AND NOT HIS JOB IS TO FULFILL THE QUALIFICATIONS OF ANY OFFICE THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR ALL OF US DO THAT WHEN WE RUN IN A DIFFERENT DISTRICTS. SOME OF THEM REQUIRE MORE SIGNATURES AND OTHERS SOME REQUIRE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS AND WE ALL KNOW THAT AND WE MEET THOSE QUALIFICATIONS -- I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR LEGAL ARGUMENTS AS THERE AND ONE OF THINGS I'VE ALWAYS DONE AND MAYBE BECAUSE MY HUSBAND WAS A JUDGE AND OUT HE ALWAYS TOLD ME NEVER PRACTICED LAW WITHOUT A LICENSE. AND DOESN'T NEVER START TRYING TO MAKE LEGAL ARGUMENTS AND STATEMENTS ABOUT STUFF YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO. SO IN THIS HOUSE I TRY TO SIMPLY DECIDE WHAT IS RIGHT WHAT IS FEAR WHAT IS JUST AND WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PEOPLE. WE WILL ALWAYS BE SUED BY SOMEBODY BECAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT PEOPLE DO EVEN WITH THE BEST BILLS WE'VE EVER PASSED SOMEBODY DECIDES THEY WANT TO FOLLOW IN JUNCTION OR SOMETHING AGAINST US. AND THAT'S A PART OF IT SO I NEVER TRY TO WRITE A BILL WITH THE FEAR THAT SOMEBODY'S GONNA SUE ME -- ALWAYS FELT THAT THE PEOPLE SU THAT'S HOW MY HUSBAND MADE A LIVING SO THAT WAS A GOOD THING. AND SO IT IT HEADED TO THE INCOME OF THE FAMILY BUT SO I NEVER WORRIED ABOUT LAWSUITS WE ALWAYS WERE ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT WHAT'S JUSTIN WAS FEAR. AND LET THOSE WHO IN THAT ARENA DECIDE WHAT'S WHERE IT FALLS IN TERMS OF THE LINES OF LAW BECAUSE YOU COULD ARGUE BOTH SIDES IT YOU'VE DONE -- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE IT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR THIS ELECTION. BUT FOR EVERY ELECTION AND WE WAIT FOR THE NEXT ELECTION WHOEVER'S PRESIDENT PEOPLE SAY THAT'S BIAS AND WE SHOULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THAT THAT PERSON SO WE'LL NEVER HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A PERSON A PRESIDENT OR ANYBODY IN OFFICE. THAT SOMEBODY WILL NOT SAY YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE NOW GOT A SOUL SO GOVERNOR YOU'VE GOT THIS AND THAT IS TARGETED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL MUCH MORE THAN WHAT IS FEAR WHAT IS JUST. AND IF WE HAD GOTTEN BEYOND THIS DISCUSSION I CAN ONLY IMAGINE. WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE TO HAVE HAD THAT INFORMATION THEN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT POINT BUT WAS STILL STUCK THE IT WITH THE WITH THE SITUATION IS THERE? AND WHAT I I DON'T DENY THE POLITICS OF IT BECAUSE OF POLITICS AS OUR IS WHAT DRIVES A LOT OF THE THINGS HERE WE SEE FLAWS IN OUR SYSTEM. WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WE WELL WE'VE ALWAYS GOTTEN PRESS OF THE OF TAX RETURNS THAT THERE'S NO QUOTE QUALIFICATION THAT REQUIRES IT SO IF IT'S IMPORTANT PEOPLE YOU RIGHT LOSS TO MAKE IT REQUIRED I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S HOW WE COME INTO. OF THE IDEA OF OF THE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT I I I I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION GETTING TO THE FLOOR -- AND I AND ALL THE WORK THAT I KNOW GOES INTO IT I APPRECIATE THOSE OF YOU WHO CAME TODAY BECAUSE YOU APPRECIATE YOUR CANDIDATE AND WHAT YOUR CANDIDATE IS. FOR I HOPE YOU ALSO WANT YOUR CANDIDATE TO TURN OVER THE TAX RETURNS IT BEING PRESIDENT IS NOT A PRIVATE VISIT AND ANYONE WHO RUNS FOR OFFICE WHO BELIEVES THEY RETAIN ALL OF THEIR PRIVACY. IS PROBABLY NOT AN ELECTED OFFICIAL -- BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL LOST A LOT OF PRIVACY WITH THIS CONCERNING OUR CHILDREN OUR PERSONAL LIVES OUR RELATIONSHIPS AFFAIRS AND NOT AFFAIRS WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY AND HAVE HAPPENS OUT THERE. THAT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC PEOPLE FOLLOWS AROUND THEY WATCH WHAT WE DO AND THAT'S A PART OF IT IN AND YOU CAN CRY ABOUT IT AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE ONLY SOLUTION IS DON'T RUN FOR OFFICE. DON'T BECOME AN ELECTED OFFICIAL BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO PEOPLE GOING TO LOOK TO SEE WHY DID YOU VOTE A CERTAIN WAY WAS THERE ANY BIAS WAS THERE ANY CONFLICT IF THEY DON'T LIKE THE BOTH THAT YOU TOOK. AND AND WE ALL INDOOR THAT WE ALL IN DOING THAT THE CONSTANT -- CHALLENGES AND SCRUTINY OF EVERYTHING WE DO AS ELECTED OFFICIALS -- WE HOPE IN THE END THAT PEOPLE APPRECIATE WHAT WE'VE DONE AND UNDERSTAND IT -- BUT THE REALITY IS YOU DO NOT RETAIN ALL YOUR PERSONAL PRIVACY -- ONCE YOU BECOME AN ELECTED OFFICIAL I HAD TO STOP GROCERY SHOP AT NIGHT WHEN I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD BECAUSE OF I DIDN'T ALL THE ALL THE ICE CREAM AND EVERYTHING I PUT IN MY BASKET WOULD WOULD BASICALLY. MELT BEFORE I GOT TO THE CHECK OUT STAND BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTED TELL ME THEIR PROBLEM IN THE GROCERY STORE AND AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL THAT WAS A PART OF THE JOB. AND UP AND SO -- THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE UNDERSTAND THOSE ARE THINGS WE WE IN DOOR AS A RESULT IN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND YOU DO NOT RETAIN ALL YOUR PRIVACY YOU MAY WOULD LOVE.
