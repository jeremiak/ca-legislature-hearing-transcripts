ACTUALLY IMPEDE THE VERY PURPOSE

00:45:57.989 --> 00:46:02.393 region:rollup2

THIRD PARTY VENDORS INDICATORS

00:46:55.246 --> 00:46:57.748 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK WE CAN WORK ON.

00:46:56.447 --> 00:46:58.582 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE THE

00:46:57.748 --> 00:47:00.718 region:rollup2
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

00:46:58.582 --> 00:47:02.286 region:rollup2
AND WE SEE THIS AS BEING A MAJOR

00:47:00.718 --> 00:47:04.555 region:rollup2
CONFLICT WITH THE PUBLIC RECORDS

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:05.489 region:rollup2
ACT AND THE STANDARD BY WHICH

00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:06.724 region:rollup2
LOCAL AGENCIES MUST CONDUCT

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:08.659 region:rollup2
THEIR BUSINESS.

00:47:06.724 --> 00:47:08.859 region:rollup2
THERE SOME LOCAL AGENCIES THAT

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.027 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:11.495 region:rollup2
.

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:13.130 region:rollup2
ADOPTED ORDINANCES THAT ARE EVEN

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:15.232 region:rollup2
MORE STRENUOUS THAN THE STATE'S

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:16.067 region:rollup2
PR A THE SUNSHINE ORDINANCES AND

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:16.967 region:rollup2
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE STANDING

00:47:16.067 --> 00:47:18.069 region:rollup2
CONFLICT.

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:20.004 region:rollup2
AND WE SEE THAT AS A DRAIN ON

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:21.639 region:rollup2
PUBLIC RESOURCES BECAUSE THE

00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:23.708 region:rollup2
