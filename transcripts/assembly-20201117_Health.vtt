MINUTES I'LL PROVIDE AN

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:32.450
OVERVIEW OF HEALTH CARE

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:34.319
CONSOLIDATION BOTH NATIONALLY

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:36.221
AND WITH A FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA

00:27:36.287 --> 00:27:37.222

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:40.358

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:43.228
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO BEFORE I

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:44.696
GET TOO FAR INTO DISCUSSION I

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:45.797
JUST WANT TO SET THE STAGE A

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:47.332
LITTLE BIT BY ASKING WHAT IF

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:48.967
THE PRICE OF FOOD INCREASED

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:50.201
LIKE THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:53.004
HAD. UP BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY

00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:54.039
FIVE AND TWENTY NINETEEN SO

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:55.540
UPDATED THESE NUMBERS A LITTLE

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:57.942
BIT. BUT BASICALLY IF THAT IF

00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:58.977
THE PRICE OF FOOD HAD INCREASED

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:00.845
AT THE SAME RATE A DOZEN

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:03.915
ORANGES WOULD COST. FIFTY SEVEN

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:07.085
DOLLARS IF YOU CLICK- A DOZEN

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:09.054
EGGS WILL COST SIXTY FIVE

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.589
DOLLARS. AND A GALLON OF MILK

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:13.224
WOULD COST A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.759
DOLLARS IF FOOD HAD INCREASED

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:15.960
AT THE SAME RATE AS HEALTHCARE

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.228
SO CLEARLY SOMETHING IS

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:18.296
HAPPENING WITH OUR HEALTH CARE

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:20.231
PRICES. AND THIS CAN ALSO BE

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:22.067
SEEN IF WE- ADVANCE THE SLIDE.

00:28:22.133 --> 00:28:23.668
THIS CAN ALSO BE SEEN IF WE

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:25.770
COMPARE. OUR PRICES IN THE

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:27.605
UNITED STATES WITH THOSE OF

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:30.208
OTHER NATIONS. OTHER NATIONS

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:32.243
PAY A FRACTION OF WHAT WE DO.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.778
AND FOR THE SAME A GOODS AND

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:35.780
SERVICES. OFTEN TIME OF EQUAL A

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:38.116
BETTER QUALITY. AND SO IN FACT

00:28:38.183 --> 00:28:41.319
PRICES CLICK. ARE THE PRIMARY

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:43.221
REASON WHY THE US SPENDS MORE

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:45.390
ON HEALTHCARE THAN ANY OTHER

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.725
COUNTRY. ADVANCE A SLIDE SO THE

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:49.494
QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.696
HEALTH CARE PRICES. WELL LOTS

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:52.664
OF THINGS HAPPENED HEALTH CARE

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.832
PRICES BUT IN THE REALM OF

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:55.633
CONSOLIDATION COMPETITION THREE

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.602
VERY IMPORTANT THINGS HAPPENED.

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:59.104
THE FIRST IS THAT WE FAIL TO

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.572
PROTECT THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:01.906
OF A FREE MARKET PRICE

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:04.075
TRANSPARENCY AND COMPETITION.

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:06.111
SECOND WE FAIL TO RIGOROUSLY

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:08.313
ENFORCE OUR ANTI TRUST LAWS.

00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:10.548
AND THIRD WE FAILED TO REGULATE

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.684
WITH COMPETITION NO LONGER

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.587
EXISTED NEXT SLIDE. SO LET'S

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:17.489
START WITH PRICE TRANSPARENCY

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:18.857
WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:20.725
NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.926
SAY IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:23.661
WHAT THEIR HEALTHCARE WILL COST

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:25.463
WE ALSO KNOW THAT ACADEMICS

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.198
POLICY MAKERS AND ENFORCERS

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.733
HAVE TROUBLE DISCOVERING THE

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.235
PRICES THAT WE PAY FOR HEALTH

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:31.769
CARE WHICH MAKES IT VERY

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:34.405
DIFFICULT TO REGULATE. IN FACT

00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:37.142
ADVANCE THE SLIDE. ON THE

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:39.511
MAJORITY OF OUR STATES RECEIVED

00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:41.112
A FAILING GRADE ON THE STATE

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:44.115
HEALTHCARE PRICE TRANSPARENCY

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:45.783
TWENTY. BY CATALYST FOR PAYMENT

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.253
REFORM. AND THE SOURCE ON

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:49.921
HEALTHCARE PRICING COMPETITION

00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:51.389
SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:53.258
MUCH MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:55.026
HAVE GOOD QUALITY PRICE

00:29:55.093 --> 00:29:56.995
INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE-

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:58.429
ON OUR HEALTH CARE IN ORDER TO

00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:00.131
KNOW WHAT TO DO. NEXT SLIDE

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:03.134
PLEASE BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WE

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:05.136
NEED TO ENFORCE OUR ANTITRUST

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:06.871
LAWS WITH MORE RIGOR WHAT YOU

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:09.374
CAN SEE HERE IS THAT FROM

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.642
NINETEEN NINETY ONE TO ABOUT

00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:12.143
TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THE FTC

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.512
DID NOT BRING A SUCCESSFUL

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:16.581
HOSPITAL MERGER CHALLENGE AND

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:19.117
THIS DID TWO THINGS ONE IT HAD

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.752
IT INSPIRED THE FTC TO SPEND

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:23.087
VALUABLE TIME AND RESOURCES-

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:24.489
CHALLENGING OTHER TYPES OF

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:26.457
MERGERS AND IT SENT A MESSAGE

00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:27.992
TO THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:29.627
THAT THEY COULD CONSOLIDATE

00:30:29.694 --> 00:30:32.497
WITHOUT MUCH RECOURSE. AND SO

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:34.499
WHAT I DID NEXT SLIDE PLEASE I

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:36.834
WAS LEAD TO HEALTH CARE MERGER

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:39.237
MANIA IN SOME SENSES SO WE

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:40.505
THOUGHT HOSPITAL'S MERGING WITH

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:42.440
OTHER HOSPITAL'S MERGING WITH

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:43.441
OTHER HOSPITALS TO FORM

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:45.009
HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. THOSE

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:46.811
HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THEN BEGAN

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:48.913
ACQUIRING PHYSICIAN GROUPS- AND

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.949
OTHER COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:52.417
AND NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING A LOT

00:30:52.483 --> 00:30:53.751
OF ITS CROSS MARKET MERGERS

00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:55.220
WHERE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN ONE

00:30:55.286 --> 00:30:57.355
GEOGRAPHIC AREA. IS ACQUIRING

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:58.890
HOSPITALS AND PROVIDER GROUPS

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:01.059
IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AND

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:03.127
THE DATA ON WHAT HAPPENS

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:05.863
FOLLOWING THESE MERGERS AND IS

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:06.998
FAIRLY ROBUST ESPECIALLY IN THE

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:09.467
REALM OF HORIZONTAL HOSPITAL

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:11.536
MERGERS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHEN

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:13.071
WE HAVE HORIZONTAL HOSPITAL

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:13.938
MERGERS THEY HAVE BEEN

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:15.707
REPEATEDLY ASSOCIATED WITH

00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:18.443
INCREASES IN PRICE FROM TWENTY

00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:19.244
TO FORTY FOUR PERCENT.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.646
REDUCTIONS IN QUALITY NEXT

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.982
SLIDE PLEASE. INCREASES IN

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:26.017
PREMIUMS IN THE ACA MARKET

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:27.919
REDUCTIONS IN WAGE GROWTH FOR

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:30.021
BOTH NURSES AND PHARMACISTS.

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.889
AND HIGHER COSTS OVERALL SO I

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.658
KNOW THAT IN SOME INSTANCES

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:35.126
HOSPITALS WILL CLAIM THAT THERE

00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:38.296
ARE- ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND

00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:39.330
EFFICIENCIES THAT COME FROM

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:42.333
THESE MERGERS. BUT TO DATE. WE

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.468
HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE THAT LARGER

00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:45.370
HOSPITALS IN LARGER SYSTEMS

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:47.038
OFTEN HAVE HIGHER OPERATING

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:48.473
COSTS AT HOSPITALS AND SMALLER

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:51.843
SYSTEMS. ADVANCE ASIDE PLEASE.

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:53.411
THE STORY IS MUCH THE SAME FOR

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:54.912
VERTICAL MERGERS YOU CAN SEE

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:57.815
HERE THAT THE POSITION ENTITIES

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:58.783
WHEN A HOSPITAL OR HEALTH

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.218
SYSTEM ACQUIRES A PHYSICIAN

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:01.986
PRACTICE- THAT IS OFTEN

00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:03.221
ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:04.956
PHYSICIAN PRICES BY ON AN

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:06.257
AVERAGE OF ABOUT FOURTEEN

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:07.892
PERCENT. FOR SPECIALIST THOSE

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:09.460
PRICES GO UP EVEN MORE SO

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:11.462
CARDIOLOGISTS PRICES HAVE BEEN

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:12.764
ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASE OF

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.466
ABOUT 33% ORTHOPEDIST'S ARE

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:18.136
ABOUT 12220% THE SAME IS TRUE

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:19.437
IN CLINICS ARE REQUIRED BY

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:21.072
HOSPITALS OR HEALTH SYSTEMS

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:22.507
THEIR PRICES HAVE BEEN SEEN TO

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:25.209
GO UP 322407% WITHIN FOUR

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:27.512
YEARS. BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:28.846
IT'S NOT JUST THE ACQUIRED

00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:30.782
ENTITY WHOSE PRICES GO UP WE

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:32.617
ALSO SEE THE HOSPITAL'S PRICES

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:34.819
IN THE ACQUIRING ENTITIES

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:36.487
PRICES GO UP AS WELL.

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:37.989
OFTENTIMES THESE MERGERS ARE

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.624
ASSOCIATED WITH LITTLE TO NO

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:41.526
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. AND WHAT'S

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:42.960
REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:44.796
VERTICAL ERGERS ARE OFTEN.

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:46.464
JUSTIFIED AND ALLOWED TO GO

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:48.366
THROUGH ON THE PROMISE OF

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:49.901
QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS IMPROVED

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:51.502
EFFICIENCIES. AND THOSE

00:32:51.569 --> 00:32:53.571
PROMISES HAVE JUST NOT BEEN

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:56.240
MET. AND NOT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:57.809
IN GENERAL AT LEAST ACCORDING

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.644
TO THE DATA THAT WE HAVE. THE

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:01.346
OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:03.448
RAISE HERE FOR YOU IS THAT. THE

00:33:03.514 --> 00:33:06.117
FEDERAL FILING THRESHOLD OF FOR

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:07.218
MERGERS UNDER THE HART SCOTT

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:08.853
RODINO ACT IS NINETY FOUR

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.655
MILLION DOLLARS. NOW THE

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:12.457
AVERAGE HOSPITAL MERGER THE

00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:14.726
MEDIAN HOSPITAL MERGER IS

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:16.794
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO THE

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.796
IF FOR A HOSPITAL AND MURDER TO

00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:19.997
BE VALUED AT EIGHTY MILLION

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:20.932
DOLLARS MEANS THAT NECESSARILY

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.467
A PHYSICIAN GROUP MERGER IS

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:23.901
MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:24.769
UNDERNEATH THAT AS WELL WHICH

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.971
MEANS TAT. THE VAST MAJORITY

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:28.573
OR A LARGE PORTION OF OUR

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:30.007
HEALTH CARE CONSOLIDATION

00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:31.909
ESPECIALLY IN THE VERTICAL AREA

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:33.678
IS FLYING UNDERNEATH FEDERAL

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:35.646
ANTI TRUST ENFORCEMENT RADAR

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:36.981
IT'S NOT BEING PICKED UP WHICH

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:39.183
MEANS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.785
FOR STATES TO BE PLAYING HERE

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:43.654
IN MONITORING- CONSOLIDATION IN

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:46.657
THESE. AREAS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:48.159
SO THE OTHER THE LAST YEAR I

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:49.260
WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:50.561
IS CROSS MARKET MERGERS AND

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:52.697
THESE HAVE BEEN OCCURRING- IN

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:54.365
LARGER NUMBERS IN RECENT YEARS

00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:55.767
AND THEY ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:58.102
WITH INCREASED PRICES BY THE

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:00.371
ACQUIRED HOSPITAL WE SEE THESE

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:03.574
INCREASED PRICES OF 7217% AND

00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:05.209
INTERESTINGLY ONE STUDY ALSO

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:06.811
FOUND THAT OTHER RIVAL

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.112
HOSPITALS IN THE SAME

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.181
GEOGRAPHIC AREA AS THE HOSPITAL

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:12.016
THAT WAS ACQUIRED ALSO INCREASE

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:14.552
THEIR PRICES BY CLOSE 28% JUST

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:16.254
SHADOWING THE PRICE INCREASE OF

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.156
THE- ACQUIRED HOSPITAL SO THE

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:19.857
EFFECT IS. PERVADING OUT

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:22.193
THROUGHOUT THE MARKET IN THAT

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.628
PARTICULAR AREA. NEXT SLIDE

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:25.763
PLEASE. AND SO ALL THIS

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.266
CONSOLIDATION- HAS AFFECTED THE

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:29.167
UNITED STATES HEALTHCARE

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:30.701
MARKETS VERY BROADLY IT'S NOT

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:32.203
JUST HOSPITALS THAT WE'RE

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.304
SEEING SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:35.740
IS. THESE ARE PERCENTAGES OF

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:37.241
OUR METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:39.844
AREAS SO. THESE ARE METRO AREAS

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:42.380
IN THE UNITED STATES 95% OF

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:44.048
THEM HAVE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:46.951
HOSPITAL MARKETS. ALMOST 80% OF

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:49.086
THEM HAVE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED A

00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:51.122
SPECIALIST PHYSICIAN MARKETS

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:53.157
NEARLY 60% OF THEM HAVE HIGHLY

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:56.294
CONCENTRATED. INSURER MARKETS.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.296
AND OVER 40% OF THEM HAVE

00:34:58.362 --> 00:34:59.664
HIGHLY CONCENTRATED PRIMARY

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:00.865
CARE PHYSICIAN MARKETS AND I

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.366
REALLY WANT TO DRAW YOUR

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:03.000
ATTENTION TO THAT BECAUSE THAT

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:05.303
HAS INCREASED. A HUNDRED AND

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:07.505
13% BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:09.574
TEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THIS

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.842
IS A MARKET TO REALLY WATCH

00:35:10.908 --> 00:35:12.643
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF COVE IT.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:13.911
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE PRIMARY

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:15.279
CARE PHYSICIAN PRACTICES HAVE

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:17.081
BEGUN TO STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:19.150
AS A RESULT OF PEOPLE NOT GOING

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:20.985
TO THE DOCTOR AS MUCH. DURING

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:21.986
COVERT AND THAT MAKES THEM

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:23.654
VULNERABLE TO ACQUISITION IN

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:24.922
THE FUTURE SO THIS IS AN AREA

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:26.457
WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE.

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.826
PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:29.427
CONSOLIDATION IS HAPPENING IN

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:31.462
THE MARKET. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:32.296
SO WE LOOKED AT SORT OF THE

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:33.898
NATIONAL NUMBERS ON THIS BUT

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.299
HOUSES AFFECTING CALIFORNIA IN

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:37.168
PARTICULAR. WELL THE MOST

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:38.503
RECENT DATA THAT I COULD GET

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:39.937
WAS FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS IS

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:41.439
FROM THE PATRIS CENTER. AND

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:43.441
WHAT THIS SHOWS IS THAT OUR

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:44.842
HOSPITAL MARKETS THROUGHOUT

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:46.878
CALIFORNIA- AT LEAST IN THE

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:48.946
TOP. TWO THIRDS OF IT OR THREE

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:50.414
QUARTERS OUR V&lt;c.cyan&gt; ARE HIGHLY&lt;/c&gt;

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:52.483
CONCENTRATED. THE SAME IS TRUE

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.852
FOR OUR INSURER MARKET THEY'RE

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:56.587
ALL HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. OUR

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.923
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN MARKETS

00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.490
ARE MUCH LESS SO- NEXT SLIDE

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:03.561
PLEASE- BUT THEY ARE RAPIDLY

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:04.862
CONSOLIDATING ON WHAT YOU CAN

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:06.664
SEE HERE IS THAT THEY HAD OF

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:07.965
MANY OF THOSE MARKETS AND

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:09.166
COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:11.435
HAD HIGHER ACQUISITION AND HAD

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:16.541

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:11.422
MOVE OUT OF STATE THEY DO OTHER

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:13.791
THINGS SO THE IMPACTS OF HEALTH

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.559
CARE NOT JUST ON OUR EMPLOYERS

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:17.795
AND OUR CITIZENS THEY AFFECT

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:19.830
THE ENTIRE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE.

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:21.598
AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:23.300
DO AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:24.268
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:25.569
ACCESS TO QUALITY AND

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:27.237
AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE AND

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:29.506
SO I'M GONNA STOP HERE M. NEXT

SLIDE AND THEN WE CAN TALK

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:34.078
ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE AT THE

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:36.513
END. OF THE HEARING THANK YOU.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.849

MEMBER BURKE WITH THIS ANY

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:41.952
QUESTIONS. AT THIS POINT. OUR

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:43.387
FIRST OFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:46.056
FOR THAT THAT OVERVIEW AND-

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:47.257
SOME OF THE STATE'S PRETTY

00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:48.892
STAGGERING STATISTICS THAT

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.728
YOU'VE LAID OUT THERE. WHEN I

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:54.732
GO BACK AND- TO A COMMENTED SHE

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.967
MADE- OR WHEN YOU'RE THEIR

00:43:57.034 --> 00:43:59.236
SLIDES WE TALKED ABOUT- IT'S A

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.838
NEW YEAR UNDER THE VERTICAL-

00:44:00.904 --> 00:44:03.607
VERTICAL INTEGRATION OR

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:06.744
VERTICAL- MERGER. PROCESSES

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.679
THAT ARE GOING ON THERE HE

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:10.748
NOTED THAT- YOU KNOW EVEN THE

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:13.684
ACQUIRING HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:17.654
SHOWING HIGHER PRICES SO IS- IS

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:18.856
PART OF THAT THE DEBT

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:22.726
MANAGEMENT OF THE ACQUISITION.

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:26.563
OF THAT OR IS IT. IS IT JUST AN

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.299
OPPORTUNITY- TO CHARGE MORE

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:31.168
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW THE BIG

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:39.543
DOG IN TOWN. SO MMHM MY

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.412
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS THAT

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:43.013
WHAT LARGELY IS HAPPENING IS

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.648
THAT THERE IS A MARKET POWER

00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:48.685
GAINED BY ACQUIRING A DESIRABLE

00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:50.487
PHYSICIAN GROUP IN THAT SPACE

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:52.456
AND THEREFORE THE HOSPITAL THEN

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:54.758
HAS AB IMPROVED MARKET POWER

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:56.560
POSITION VIS A VIS NEGOTIATIONS

00:44:56.627 --> 00:44:58.162
WITH INSURERS. AND THEY HAVE

00:44:58.228 --> 00:45:00.130
THE ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICES

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:01.632
NOW IT'S NOT OUT OF THE

00:45:01.698 --> 00:45:02.800
QUESTION THAT SOME OF THAT

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.101
INCREASE IN PRICES DUE TO DEBT

00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:06.236
MANAGEMENT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:07.337
IS THAT THOSE THINGS WERE

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:08.672
CONTROLLED FOR AND THAT IN

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.274
GENERAL THE PRICE INCREASES ARE

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.177
DUE TO- TO COMPETITION AND

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:15.846
ADVANCES AND MARKET POWER- SO

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:17.181
AND THEN AND THEN YOU HAD

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:19.516
ANOTHER SLIDE ON. ON OUTPATIENT

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:21.852
CENTER- SPENDING AND ONCE AGAIN

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:22.653
SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:24.088
PRETTY STAGGERING THAT

00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:26.023
OBVIOUSLY PRICES A HUGE HUGE

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:28.525
COMPONENT. OF FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:31.562
IN SAN FRANCISCO AT SOME. PRICE

00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:33.197
BEING 72% HIGHER THAN THE

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:35.199
NATIONAL AVERAGE IN SAN JOSE A

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:38.102
HUNDRED AND FOUR PERCENT- OF

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:40.337
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND WHAT

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:43.273
YOU SAID WAS- YOU ALSO SEE

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:47.177
LOWER UTILIZATION SO PRICE. IS

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:51.014
DRIVING THAT LOWER UTILIZATION-

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:57.054
FERRIS FAIR TO SAY. SO I THINK

00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:58.956
THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN A STUDY DO

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:00.424
DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PRICE IS

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:01.625
DRIVING THAT UTILIZATION IT

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:04.161
CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED HERE- BUT

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:05.863
I NOTE WEEK WE DO SEE THAT

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:07.564
PEOPLE ARE FORGOING CARE THERE

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:08.565
HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES

00:46:08.632 --> 00:46:09.833
DEMONSTRATING THAT I JUST

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.601
HAVEN'T SEEN IT TIED

00:46:10.667 --> 00:46:12.136
SPECIFICALLY IN THE YOU KNOW

00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:14.071
SAN JOSE OR SAN FRANCISCO BUT

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.039
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THAT IF

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.508
THE PRICES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:19.009
HIGHER WE SEE SOME. WE SEE

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.878
SIGNIFICANT LOWER UTILIZATION

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:22.412
THAT SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE

00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:23.947
NOT GOING AND SEEKING CARE

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.048
BECAUSE OF PRICE AND THAT IS

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:27.518
CERTAINLY THE CONCERN THAT WE

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:28.051
WOULD SEE IN THIS. IN THIS

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:33.590
SITUATION. SO AS WE SEE- AS WE

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:37.461
SEE THESE. THESE TRENDS- IS. IS

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:40.097
PART OF THE- YEAH I DO WONDER

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:41.899
IF THERE'S AT THE TAIL WAGGING

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:42.699
THE DOG OR SOMETHING GOING ON

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:44.568
HERE BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY THESE

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:47.771
SYSTEMS HAVE- HAVE. OVERHEAD

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:50.674
AND COSTS AND SO- YOU KNOW IS

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:51.909
LOWER IS THERE YOUR LOWER

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:54.111
UTILIZATION. IN GENERAL AND

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:55.145
THEN THEY HAVE TO RAISE THE

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:57.481
PRICE TO KEEP THE REVENUE UP OR

00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:59.316
OR IS THE REP YOU KNOW ARE

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:00.117
THERE ANY STUDIES SHOW THAT THE

00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:02.686
REVENUE. ARE THE PRICES IS

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:04.888
AFFECTING YOU SEE WHERE I'M

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:10.394
GOING WITHOUT QUESTION. I DO SO

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.329
I THINK THAT IT DEPENDS ON

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:13.297
WHERE YOU ARE NOW IT'S

00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:14.064
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.732
THESE ARE METROPOLITAN

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:17.434
STATISTICAL THESE ARE THESE ARE

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:19.603
URBAN CENTERS. AND SO IN URBAN

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.371
CENTERS THERE ARE LOTS OF

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:23.006
PEOPLE AND THERE'S NOT AS MUCH

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:25.509
OF A NEED TO GENERATE CARE TO

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:27.311
KEEP THE DOORS OPEN IN RURAL

00:47:27.377 --> 00:47:28.946
CENTERS WE SEE A LOT MORE OF

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.480
THAT WHERE. JUST KEEPING THE

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:33.984
HOSPITAL GOING REQUIRES- YOU

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:35.018
KNOW A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:35.953
TO COME IN THE DOOR AND THERE

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:37.921
MIGHT NOT BE A POPULATION-

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.590
SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THAT

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:41.858
LEVEL OF CARE BUT IN URBAN

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:42.426
CENTERS I THINK THAT'S MUCH

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:45.662
LESS OF A CONCERN. SO WERE ALSO

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:49.299
SEEN- WITH THESE WITH THESE

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:53.737
INCREASED COSTS AND PRICES- AND

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:56.406
THE CONSOLIDATION AROUND. IN

00:47:56.473 --> 00:47:59.176
THE MARKET PLACE- IS CERTAINLY

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.078
IN AREAS YOU KNOW AND IN

00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:02.913
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.582
MAJOR DOMINANT PLAYERS AND SO.

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:08.518
ON SO THAT. IN TURN LEADS TO

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:10.320
HIGHER HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:13.123
COSTS BECAUSE OF NETWORK

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.559
ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS. YEAH I

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:18.328
BELIEVE AND THAT MAKES ME MAKES

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.664
ME CONCERNED THAT SO PART OF

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.432
THE INSURANCE COSTS OR THE

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:24.501
RIVER PREMIUMS IS RELATED TO

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:26.737
THE CONSOLIDATION BECAUSE- THE

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.605
BIGGER SYSTEM THAT IS THE

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:30.173
DOMINANT SYSTEM IN THE AREA.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.842
KNOWS THAT THE COMPANIES HAVE

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:34.945
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR

00:48:35.012 --> 00:48:37.914
THEIR PLANNED SO- THERE IS IT

00:48:37.981 --> 00:48:40.150
IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT'S ALL

00:48:40.217 --> 00:48:41.785
FEEDING ITSELF HERE AND THE

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:43.687
CONSUMER IS THE ONE WHO WAS IS

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:53.864
SUFFERING. YES YOU'RE

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.533
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT SO WEEK- WE

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.268
CALL THAT HAVING A MUST HAVE

00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:00.304
HOSPITAL OR MUST HAVE PROVIDER

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:02.139
WHERE NETWORK ADEQUACY LAWS OR

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.907
PATIENTS DEMANDED THAT A

00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:05.976
CERTAIN PROVIDER BE IN A

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:07.611
NETWORK- THIS OFTEN HAPPENS

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:08.812
BECAUSE OF NETWORK ADEQUACY

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:10.480
LAWS IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S ONE

00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:12.182
HOSPITAL AND A GEOGRAPHIC

00:49:12.249 --> 00:49:16.486
REGION. AND SO- IN THOSEINSTANCES PROVIDERS THAT HAVE

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:17.988
THOSE MUST HAVE HOSPITALS NOT

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.856
ONLY CAN LEVERAGE THEIR PRICES

00:49:19.923 --> 00:49:22.693
UP TO MONOPOLY LEVELS AND- FOR

00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:26.229
THOSE HOSPITALS BUT AS WE SAW-

AND UNDERGO AN INVESTIGATIVE

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:40.689
PROCESS AND AGO LITIGATION. IT

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:43.525
INTRODUCES- I DIFFICULTY AND

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:45.494
TIME TODAY TO ADD TO THE

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.362
CHALLENGE INTO THE PROCESS BUT

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.898
IT ALSO. INTRODUCES UNCERTAINTY

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:51.833
RIGHT IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT-

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.369
TO- NOW TO CHALLENGE AND THEN

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.271
HAVE THAT BE DEPENDENT UPON THE

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:58.440
PARTICULAR PARTICULARITIES OF A

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:01.309
JUDGE OR THEIR- ASSESSMENT OF

THE CASE LAW. SO IT'S A

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:05.180
COMBINATION OF FACTORS I WOULD

SAY BOTH THINGS I'M DEFINITELY

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:11.086
I'M MORE NOTICE- OF THESE

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:12.687
TRANSACTIONS BOTH A SMALLER

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:14.489
TRANSACTIONS AND MERGERS AND

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:16.124
ALSO A YOU KNOW A VERTICAL

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.260
INTEGRATION SILVA PHYSICIANS'

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:21.763
GROUPS- IN MILITARY CENTERS I

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.098
FOR INSTANCE WOULD BE

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:28.203
BENEFICIAL- SORRY CERTAINLY TO

FINANCIAL SITUATION. YES

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:44.586
CERTAINLY WHEN WE ARE IN OUR

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:47.022
TRANSACTION REVIEW PROCESS WE-

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.356
LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF THE

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:50.058
CIRCUMSTANCES SO WE DO TAKE

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:52.594
INTO- INTO ACCOUNT IS THAT IS

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.963
THE HOSPITAL I'M GOING TO EXIST

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:57.065
WITHOUT ADD THE TRANSACTION OR

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:59.334
THE AGREEMENT GOING INTO PLACE-

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:00.836
WE AND IN PART OF THAT TOO AS

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:02.637
WE ALLOW FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I'M

01:19:02.704 --> 01:19:05.273
IN THE MEETINGS AND WRITTEN-PUBLIC COMMENT THAT GIVES US A

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.074
FULL SOME PICTURE OF WHAT'S

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.443
GOING ON AND WE DO. AS I NOTED

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.912
WE DO I'M ARE WE AND WE TAKE

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:12.147
INTO ACCOUNT A HEALTH IMPACT

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:14.049
REPORT WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:15.150
COMPETITION FACTOR SO ALL OF

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:17.552
THAT. COMES INTO PLAY IN

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.488
DETERMINING WHETHER TO APPROVE

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:22.257
OR CONDITIONALLY APPROVED I

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:23.925
TRANSACTION. SO DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:28.163
IN ANY IN THE SENSE OF- THE

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.431
DICKON THE SMALLER

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:30.499
CONSOLIDATIONS THAT ARE BELOW

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:32.801
THE THRESHOLD. YOU HAVE ANY

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:34.836
SENSE OF WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.138
THAT TO THE OVERALL

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:40.275
CONSOLIDATION- COULD MARKET IS

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:43.545
I MEAN. DO WE KNOW DO WE REALLY

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.013
KNOW WHERE THESE THEY JUST

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.048
THESE THINGS JUST FINE SO FAR

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:47.582
UNDER THE RADAR THAT IT'S

01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:49.718
REALLY HARD TO TRACK HIM. I

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:51.786
THINK THAT'S RIGHT AT THAT.

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:54.623
DOCTOR WOULD I'M WE HAVE BEEN

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:55.790
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:57.025
TO TRAP THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:58.593
GETTING THE NOTICE ON WE HAVE

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.663
TO RELY. ON WHAT WE SEE IN THE

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.298
NEWS I THINK WE'VE THAT WE'VE

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:05.100
SEEN THAT IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.169
TO GET A SENSE OF A PICTURE OF.

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.603
OF THESE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.071
THE SMALLER TRANSACTIONS THE

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.140
FOR PROFIT TRANSACTIONS- I'M

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:13.375
UNLESS THEY ARE MAKING THE NEWS

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:14.643
AND I'M MUCH WE'RE HEARING

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:17.546
ABOUT IT. I'M OTHERWISE BECAUSE

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:18.680
WE DON'T GET THAT NOTICED. IS

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:20.615
THERE- AND I BRING THIS UP

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.484
BECAUSE I I'M THINKING OF- SOME

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:25.554
OF THE- ACQUISITIONS AND

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.422
OPERATIONS OF SKILLED NURSING

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:30.625
FACILITIES AND HOW HOW- LAND

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.427
MIGHT BE OWNED BY ONE GROUP.

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:34.229
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A PRINCIPLE

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:38.099
THAT'S CONNECTED TO ANOTHER- IS

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.501
IT POSSIBLE THAT IN THE

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:41.870
CONSOLIDATION MARKET THE

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:42.470
SMALLER CONSOLIDATION MARKET

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:44.739
THAT THERE ARE. THAT THERE ARE

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.741
ENTITIES THAT ARE COMMON TO

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:49.744
THESE CONSOLIDATIONS. THAT ARE

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:51.379
OPERATING IN SUCH A WAY TO KEEP

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:53.248
THINGS BELOW THE THRESHOLD IS

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:55.684
THAT A POSSIBILITIES SO AS TO

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:59.554
NOT RAISE THE REVIEW PROCESS

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:00.121
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:04.192
OFFICE. YES I THINK THAT

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.560
CERTAINLY CAN BE A POSSIBILITY

01:21:05.627 --> 01:21:07.329
IN AND THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:09.898
PROVIDED IS A GOOD ONE I'M I

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:11.266
THINK YOU SEE THAT A LOT IN THE

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.001
SKILLED NURSING. FACILITY

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:15.403
SCENARIO- WHERE THEY'LL BE A

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.072
PRINCIPLE THAT HOMES MAYBE LIKE

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.940
5% OF ANY PARTICULAR TIME

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:21.276
TRANSACTION AND SO IT'S

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:21.910
DIFFICULT AND TO TRACK AND THEY

01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:24.613
MAY NOT. EVEN COME TO THE LEVEL

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:27.882
OF A PERCENTAGE OF OWNERSHIP

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:28.483
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DIG DEEP

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.418
INTO IT. SO FROM YOUR

01:21:30.485 --> 01:21:31.586
PERSPECTIVE COULD THERE BE

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:32.854
OTHER REASONS COSTS ARE GOING

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.889
UP IN- BEAST BESIDES THE

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.758
INTEGRATION I MEAN NO MEDIC

01:21:36.825 --> 01:21:38.693
INCREASING MEDICARE POPULATIONS

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.295
OF THE RISING COSTS OF DRUGS I

01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:44.432
MEAN. THOSE THOSE POSSIBILITIES.

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:45.533
THEY MAY BE BUT REALLY-

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.269
VERTICAL HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:49.104
AND CROSSMARK I MARKET A FAX OR

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:50.305
THE SINGLE BIGGEST DRIVER OF

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:52.974
COST ON. IN CONSOLIDATION IN

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.809
NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE- SO FROM

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.911
OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT AT WE

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.313
THINK THAT THIS IS THE BIGGEST

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.415
ISSUE AFFECTING HEALTH CARE

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:01.916
CONSOLIDATION RIGHT NOW-

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.918
ANOTHER ANOTHER. BIG PART OF

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.487
THAT TOO IS THE ANOTHER DRIVER

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.155
OF COST IS THE ACQUISITION OF

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:08.857
HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS BY PRIVATE

01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:11.726
EQUITY GROUPS AND HEDGE FUNDS-

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:12.327
JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A NATURAL

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.529
TENSION BETWEEN- THERE NEED TO

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.264
RETURN INVESTMENT IN A CERTAIN

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:18.433
A LIMITED TIME FRAME- I'M IN A

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.702
STORE WINDOW AND- THE PROVISION

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:21.336
OF QUALITY HEALTHCARE AT A LOW

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:23.605
COST. SO THESE ARE THE BIG

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.440
DRIVERS OF HEALTHCARE COSTS

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:28.576
GROUPINGS AND SO- I HER RT HER

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.011
PART OF THE ANSWER BURKE AND I

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:31.279
AND I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE IN

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:33.748
THE LAST LEGISLATIVE HERE- YOU

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:34.983
KNOW FROM THE AG'S OFFICE

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:36.751
PERSPECTIVE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:40.455
INCREASE OVERSIGHT. OF

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:42.257
INCREASED CONSOLIDATION. YES

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.626
THANK YOU EAT. WE BELIEVE THAT

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.061
ULTIMATELY THE GOLD STANDARD

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:47.362
WOULD BE TO HAVE SORT OF SOME

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.531
SORT OF A OUR- SYSTEM OF REVIEW

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:51.499
OF PRE TRANSACTION REVEAL I'M

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:53.735
GIVING US THE ABILITY. TO LOOK

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.904
AT THESE TRANSACTIONS- I'M IN A

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:58.239
STRUCTURED WAY BEFORE I DAY A

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:00.041
CAR ON IT BECAUSE IT'S MUCH

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:01.810
EASIER TO DO THAT THAN TO I'M

01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:04.379
I'M SCRAMBLE THE ACHES ASKING-

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:05.213
AND THEN AT THE VERY LEAST

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.781
THERE SHOULD BE NOTICED. OF

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:09.117
THESE TRANSACTIONS- BOTH. YOU

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:10.552
KNOW THE MEDIUM SIZE A SMALL

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:12.654
ONES AND- HOW THE SYSTEMS

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.889
OUTSIDE PHYSICIANS GROUPS OUT

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:16.624
YOU KNOW. OUTPATIENT CLINICS

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:18.326
THINGS LIKE THAT TIME SO

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:19.361
NOTIFICATION BUT NOT

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:22.364
NECESSARILY. INVESTIGATION AND

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.733
JUST I THINK PROVIDE WE REALLY

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:25.700
DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THESE

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:27.135
CONSOLIDATION SO WOULD BE NICE

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:28.803
TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW AND TRACK.

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:30.438
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKET

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:31.706
PLACES OUT OF IS THAT FAIR TO

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:33.641
SAY. I WOULD SAY THE VERY LEAST

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:36.411
WE NEED THAT OBVIOUSLY PRE- PRE

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.113
TRANSACTION REVIEW I'M TO BE

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:42.684
ABLE TO DIG INTO THESE. WOULD

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:43.651
BE THE GOLD STANDARD. THANK YOU.

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:44.586
I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TEST

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.621
TODAY WE APPRECIATE IT AND-

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:48.123
WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:50.759
ON TO OUR OUR OUR FINAL SPEAKER

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:52.794
THEN THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:53.628
THAT WOULD BE WERE BRINGING AND

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:55.230
BRINGING IT BACK TO- PROFESSOR

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:57.766
KING. GOOD TO TALK TO US ABOUT

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:59.134
THE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.702
THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY

01:24:00.769 --> 01:24:05.807
CONSOLIDATION PROFESSOR. THANK

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.310
YOU SO MUCH GIVE ME THANK YOU

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:12.447
SO MUCH- I AM DELIGHTED TO BE

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:13.782
BACK TO TALK ABOUT WHAT CAN BE

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.383
DONE SO NEXT SLIDE AND I'LL

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:18.787
PICK UP UP RIGHT HERE SO. I

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:20.221
THINK THERE ARE FOUR THINGS

01:24:20.288 --> 01:24:21.856
THAT CAN BE DONE FOR AREAS THAT

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:23.758
THAT CALIFORNIA CAN TARGET

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:26.161
FIRST. WE NEED TO WE NEED TO

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.328
GET THE DATA WHAT WE

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:28.496
CONSISTENTLY HEARD THROUGHOUT

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.031
THIS HEARING AND OTHER HEARINGS

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:32.167
IS THAT IT IS A LACK. OF DATA

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:34.135
ABOUT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:36.638
THAT IS CAUSING US TO NOT HAVE

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:38.406
ALWAYS THE BEST INSIGHTS INTO

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:39.941
THE BEST WAYS TO REGULATE TO

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.176

NEED TO ENHANCE AGENCY

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:26.187
OVERSIGHT OVER HEALTH CARE

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:28.389
MARKETS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:29.924
LET'S START WITH THE DATA SO

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:32.093
CALIFORNIA'S IN THAT- IN THE

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.695
PROCESS OF DEVELOPING ITS

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:35.463
HEALTH CARE COST TRANSPARENCY

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:37.165
DATABASE- WHICH WOULD BE GREAT

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:37.832
IT'S AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:39.567
DATABASE AT. AND THAT WILL PUT

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.302
CALIFORNIA ON PAR WITH THE

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:42.303
EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:44.072
EXISTING ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:46.307
BASES. THESE DATABASES WERE

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:47.475
ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO HELP

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:49.744
CONSUMERS MAKE BETTER CHOICES

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:50.778
IN THEIR HEALTHCARE AND BE ABLE

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:52.447
TO SEE THE VARIANCE IN PRICE

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:54.148
BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND SELECT

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:55.083
ONE THAT WAS MAYBE HIGHER

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:57.652
VALUE. THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT

01:25:57.719 --> 01:25:58.920
IT'S NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:00.488
THING AND THE MOST EFFECTUAL

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:02.090
THING THAT CAN BE DONE WITH

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:03.358
THIS ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:05.760
DATA. THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.428
OF THIS DATA IS FOR POLICY AND

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:09.330
ENFORCEMENT. WE'VE SEEN THE

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:12.066
STATE'S THAT HAVE EFFECTIVELY

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:14.335
ANALYZED AND USED THIS DATA.

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:15.737
USE IT IN WAYS TO PROVIDE

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:17.438
ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:18.406
FUNCTIONING OF THEIR HEALTHCARE

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:20.708
MARKETS. INFORM MERGER AND

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.143
ALICE'S AND REVIEW AS THE

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.745
HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION IN

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:24.178
MASSACHUSETTS DID SO

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:26.848
SUCCESSFULLY- IN THE PARTNERS

01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:29.117
CASE I THINK IT CAN BE USED TO

01:26:29.183 --> 01:26:30.919
IDENTIFY THE DRIVERS OF COST

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:32.387
AND TRACK PRICES POST

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:33.755
CONSOLIDATION TO SEE WHAT THE

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:35.657
OUTCOME. OF A MERGER ACTUALLY

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:38.593
WAS- IT CAN BE USED TO TRACK

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.461
UTILIZATION AND PRICE TRENDS OF

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:42.030
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE SAW

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:43.097
IN THE DATA WHERE OUR PRICES

01:26:43.164 --> 01:26:43.965
WERE VERY HIGH BETTER

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.433
UTILIZATION UTILIZATION WAS

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.068
VERY LOW IF YOU HAD THAT DATA

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:48.102
YOU COULD DIG INTO IT MORE TO

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:50.371
FIND OUT. WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:52.173
WERE NOT GOING TO THE DOCTOR

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.042
BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF PRICE.

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:55.410
YOU CAN USE THIS DATA TO

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:57.245
IDENTIFY LOW VALUE SERVICES

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:59.747
INFORM AND PRIORITIZE POLICY

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:01.616
GOALS AND MONITOR POLICY

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:03.618
INITIATIVES. IT CAN ALSO BE

01:27:03.685 --> 01:27:05.453
USED- TO ESTABLISH BENCHMARK

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.589
PRICING AND HEALTH CARE COST

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:09.223
GROWTH BENCHMARKS AS WE'VE SEEN

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:10.992
IN MASSACHUSETTS SO THIS DATA

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.261
CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN LOTS

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:16.297
OF WAYS. FURTHERMORE NEXT SLIDE

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:17.432
AT THE STATE OF FORMS THE

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:19.500
FOUNDATION OF ANY INITIATIVE

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:21.269
THAT THE STATE MIGHT WANT TO.

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:23.004
PROMOTE TO SUPPORT COMPETITIVE

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:24.973
MARKETS SO WHETHER THE STATE IS

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:26.474
LOOKING TOWARDS LITIGATION

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:28.509
LEGISLATION OR REGULATORY

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:30.511
OVERSIGHT WHICH THEY NEED ALL

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:31.412
THREE TO SUPPORT COMPETITIVE

01:27:31.479 --> 01:27:33.214
MARKETS. THAT DATA IS REALLY

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:35.683
GOING TO FORM THE FOUNDATION OF

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:36.250
ANY INITIATIVE THAT THEY PUT

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:39.420
FORWARD. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE SO

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:41.122
I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:42.123
ABOUT THE ROLE OF LITIGATION

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:43.925
BUT IT'S- LESS RELEVANT FOR

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:45.460
THIS COMMITTEE SO I'M NOT GOING

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:47.395
TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON IT-

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:49.831
BUT- THE STATE CAN INTERVENE

01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:51.633
THROUGH LITIGATION IN REALLY

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:52.333
THREE WAYS AND THE STORAGE

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.601
REALLY POINT AT ALL ALL OF

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:55.103
THESE OUT. SO I WON'T SPEND TOO

01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:58.539
MUCH TIME ON IT- NEXT SLIDE.

01:27:58.606 --> 01:27:59.574
BUT FIRST IS A PRE MERGER

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:01.342
CHALLENGE WHERE THE STATE CAN

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:03.544
INTERVENE. BEFORE THE MERGER

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:04.912
HAPPENS TO PREVENTIVE

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:06.414
CONSOLIDATION FROM OCCURRING AT

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:07.782
ALL THIS IS REALLY THE GOLD

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.050
STANDARD WHEN WE THINK OF ANTI

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.218
TRUST ENFORCEMENT YOU WANT TO

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:12.353
PREVENT CONSOLIDATION BEFORE IT

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.788
HAPPENS- THEN WE'VE SEEN

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:14.756
SUCCESSFUL PRE MERGER

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:16.591
CHALLENGES. OCCUR IN THE SAINT

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:18.726
LUKE'S CASE IN IDAHO. AND THE

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.595
PARTNER SOUTH SHORE CASE IN

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:21.329
MASSACHUSETTS AS WELL AS THE

SANFORD HEALTH CASE. AND IN

01:28:24.198 --> 01:28:26.034
NORTHERN IN NORTH DAKOTA. NEXT

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:30.171
SLIDE PLEASE. SO NEXT IS. THE

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:31.439
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL AND

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:33.207
OVERSIGHT AND WE BOTH HEARD-

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:34.742
MADAM DIRECTOR ONCE NOW THEY

AND THE STORAGE TALK ABOUT

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:37.679
CONDITIONS PLACED ON MERGERS TO

01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:39.614
GO THROUGH THE REALITY IS THAT

01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:41.282
THE AG'S OFFICE AND DAMAGE THE

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:42.483

PREVENT EVERY CONSOLIDATING

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:45.319

FRUITION AND SO THEY NEED TO BE

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:53.428
ABLE TO. AB IMPOSE CONDITIONS

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:54.829
ON THOSE MERGERS AND THOSE CAN

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:56.798
BE VERY HELPFUL I WE'VE SEEN

01:28:56.864 --> 01:28:58.499
THESE BE IS VERY EFFECTIVELY IN

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:00.034
THE BETH ISRAEL LAHEY CASE AND

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.969
MASSACHUSETTS- AND IN OTHER

SO NEXT SLIDE. SO EARLIER THIS

01:29:07.575 --> 01:29:10.978
YEAR- I WROTE A PAPER WITH BOB

01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:12.947
BERENSON CATHERINE GOT X. N.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:14.816
AND ROSALYN MURRAY AND IS A

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:16.551
PART OF THAT PAPER WE LOOKED AT

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:17.985
CONSENT DECREES AND THE KINDS

01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:19.887
OF CONDITIONS THAT WERE IMPOSED

01:29:19.954 --> 01:29:21.622
AND PUT THEM INTO A TYPOLOGY.

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:22.990
AND WHAT WE DID WAS THESE- WE

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:24.158
CAME UP WITH FIVE THINGS THAT

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:26.894
ARE COMMONLY USED BY STATES AS

01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:27.895
CONDITIONS. AND THESE CAN BE

01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:29.764
PUT IN PLACE- AS A PART OF

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.032
ALLOWING THE MERGER TO GO

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:32.967
FORWARD SO THE FIRST IS.

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:34.135
INSURED NEGOTIATION

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.670
REQUIREMENTS REQUIRING THAT

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:37.405
ENTITIES THE MERGING ENTITIES

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:39.607
ENGAGED IN ARBITRATION. SECOND

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:41.442
WE SAW THINGS LIKE LIMITATIONS

01:29:41.509 --> 01:29:42.844
ON CONTRACT TERMS HERE FOR A

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.278
STATE AT THE STATE COULD IMPOSE

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:46.314
LIMITS ON PRICE INCREASES. ON

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.548
MARGINS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF

HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OR ON

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:51.619
PRICES OVERALL THEY CAN JUST

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:53.287
SIMPLY CAP PRICES. THIRD WE

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:54.822
THOUGHT PROHIBITIONS AND

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:56.023
REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:58.259
CONTRACT PROVISIONS. ON THINGS

01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:00.228
LIKE BANNING THE USE OF MOST

CLAUSES AND ANTI STEERING

01:30:03.164 --> 01:30:04.465
PROVISIONS THAT CAN BE DONE AS

01:30:04.532 --> 01:30:06.501
PART OF A CONSENT DECREE- I'LL

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:07.602
TALK ABOUT THOSE MORE IN IN

01:30:07.668 --> 01:30:09.070
TERMS OF WHAT THAT. LEGISLATION

01:30:09.137 --> 01:30:11.172
AS WELL IN A MINUTE. FOURTH

THEY CAN BE USED TO PROHIBIT OR

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:14.308
REQUIRE CERTAIN TYPES OF

CONDUCT THINGS LIKE REQUIRING

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:17.345
RELEASE OF PHYSICIANS FROM NON

COMPETE CLAUSES AS A PART OF

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:20.615
THE MERGER. AND THEN FIFTH THEY

01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:22.750
CAN BE USED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:24.619
CERTAIN POPULATIONS- AND

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:25.920
ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO

01:30:28.389 --> 01:30:31.359
POPULATIONS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:33.661
AND FINALLY LITIGATION CAN BE

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:36.164
USED- TO CHALLENGE ANTI

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:38.166
COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR. WHAT'S

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:39.734
REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT IT'S

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:42.670
IMPORTANT FOR STATES TO PREVENT

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:43.671
ANY FURTHER. CONSOLIDATION OF

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.339
THE MARKET AS MUCH AS THEY CAN

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:47.108
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:48.142
RECOGNIZE THAT OUR MARKETS ARE

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:50.378
HIGHLY CONSOLIDATED ALREADY AND

01:30:50.444 --> 01:30:51.746
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:52.547
WE'RE MONITORING AND CAN

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:54.982
EFFECTIVELY. MANAGE THE

01:30:55.049 --> 01:30:56.617
BEHAVIOR OF THESE ENTITIES THAT

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:57.852
ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF MARKET

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.153
POWER AND WE SAW THE AG'S

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.822
OFFICE DO THIS VERY

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:01.355
SUCCESSFULLY IN THE SUTTER

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:03.891
HEALTH CASE- THAT WAS THAT WAS

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.693
TRIED LAST YEAR. AND THEN ALSO

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.228
THE NORTH CAROLINA AG DID THAT

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.763
VERY SUCCESSFULLY IN THE ATRIUM

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:10.131
CASE BOTH OF THOSE CASES CAME

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:11.199
DOWN AND SETTLEMENTS BUT THEY

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:12.900
WERE QUITE. A STRONG

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:13.501
SETTLEMENTS FROM THE POSITION

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:18.039
OF THE AG SO. NEXT SLIDE- SO

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:19.307
THESE THE TERMS OF THE

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:21.042
SETTLEMENTS AS CAN LOOK AT A

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.443
LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS SO. THE

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:24.045
FIRST IS THAT THEY CAN PROHIBIT

01:31:24.111 --> 01:31:25.880
ALL OR NOTHING CONTRACTING. AND

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:27.148
THEN REQUIRE ISOLATED

SYSTEMS. TO BREAK UP HOW

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.388
INSURERS CONTRACT WITH THEM SO

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.423
THEY CAN'T DO THAT LEVERAGING

01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:36.791
THAT- CHAIRMAN WOULD AND I WERE

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:38.292
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. WHERE

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:39.160
THEY LEVERAGE A MUST HAVE

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:40.862
PROVIDER TO DRIVE UP PRICES

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:41.996
WITH OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:44.031
SYSTEM- THE NEXT TERM OF THE

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:46.167
SETTLEMENT. IS AB PROHIBIT ANY

THINGS LIKE ANY TEARING ANY

01:31:49.737 --> 01:31:50.872
STEERING CLAUSES WHICH WE SAW

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:52.640
THE STTLEMENT. IN THE SUTTER

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:54.575
HEALTH CASE IN THE ATRIUM

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:56.143
HEALTH CASE PROHIBIT. THIRD

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:57.812
THEY CAN REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.213
ASSETS OR AN ABANDONMENT OF THE

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.048
MERGER ALTOGETHER AS WE SAW IN

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:02.283
SAINT LUKE'S AND CHI

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.385
FRANCISCAN. AND THEN FINALLY

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:05.519
THEY CAN PROVIDE MONETARY

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:07.922
RELIEF- AND THEY SAID THE

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.557
CENTER SETTLEMENT HERE- CAME IN

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:11.092
AT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:11.692
MILLION DOLLARS WHICH I KNOW

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:12.927
HAS BEEN FINALIZED YET BUT

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:13.794
THAT'S THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:16.130
NUMBER- SO THESE SETTLEMENTS

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:18.666
CAN DO. A LOT FOR DRIVING

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:20.868
BEHAVIOR AND INFORMING. THE

01:32:20.935 --> 01:32:22.370
MARKETS M. AND MARKET

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:24.872
PARTICIPANTS ON WHAT BEHAVIOR

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:26.641
IS APPROPRIATE NEXT SLIDE. BUT

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:27.642
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:29.610
RECOGNIZE THAT LITIGATION ONLY

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:32.813
GOES SO FAR IT IS VERY ARDUOUS

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.148
AS IN A STORAGE POINTED OUT AND

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:35.750
IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN YOU'RE NOT

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:37.551
ALWAYS GOING TO. TO WIN THE

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:39.921
CASE IS THAT YOU BRING AND SO

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.455
LITIGATION IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:43.124
TENDING TO ONE PLANT IN YOUR

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:45.660
GARDEN- THAT'S MAYBE. NOT DOING

01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:48.896
SO WELL- BUT YOU NEED RULES OF

01:32:48.963 --> 01:32:50.398
THE ROAD AND AN OVER ARCHING

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:52.366
PLAN TO ADDRESS THE ENTIRE

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:56.437
MARKET- THE ENTIRE FARM. SO

01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:57.571
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:32:57.638 --> 01:32:58.940
WHAT CAN BE DONE THROUGH

01:32:59.006 --> 01:33:01.609
LEGISLATION- TO. ADDRESS MARKET

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.277
CONSOLIDATION AND AN CONTROL

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:06.314
PRICES NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.516
OVER THE LAST- SEVERAL YEARS

01:33:08.582 --> 01:33:10.017
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT STATE

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:12.486
LEGISLATION TO DO JUST THAT TO

01:33:12.553 --> 01:33:14.422
CONTROL MARKET CONSOLIDATION

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:16.190
AND PRICES AND STATES HAVE

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:17.291
REALLY BUNDLED AS THEY THEY

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:18.459
SORT OF ATTACKED THIS PROBLEM

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:20.928
IN THREE WAYS SO THE FIRST IS

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:22.997
BY NEXT LINE THE FIRST IS BY

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:24.498
ADDRESSING SPECIFIC MARKET

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:27.401
IMPERFECTIONS. THINGS LIKE MOST

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:29.170
FAVORED NATION PROHIBITIONS

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:31.138
SURPRISE BILLING LAWS ANTI

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:32.907
STEERING AB PROHIBITIONS AND

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:34.875
ALL OR NOTHING SO LET'S TALK A

01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:35.509
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THESE CONTRACT

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:37.745
TERMS. WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE ON

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:39.847
THE NEXT SLIDE IS THAT NINETEEN

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:42.783
STATES. I HAVE PROHIBITED THE

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.051
USE OF MOST FAVORED NATIONS

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:46.053
PROVISIONS MOST FAVORED NATIONS

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:50.891
PROVISIONS REQUIRE- A PROVIDER

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.994
TO GUARANTEED TO ENSURE THAT

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.929
THEY WILL NOT GIVE A BETTER

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:57.531
PRICE OR A BETTER RATE. TO ANY

01:33:57.598 --> 01:33:59.200
OF THE INSURERS COMPETITORS TO

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:00.568
ANY OTHER INSURER AND IF THEY

01:34:00.634 --> 01:34:02.670
DO THEY HAVE TO THEN PROVIDE

01:34:02.737 --> 01:34:03.738
THE ENSURE THEY GAVE THE MOST

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:05.639
FAVORED NATION PROVISION TO A

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.475
LOWER PRICE AS WELL. WHAT'S

01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:09.043
IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS IT

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:10.478
ALLOWS PRICES TO DRIFT UP

01:34:10.544 --> 01:34:12.179
ESPECIALLY IN MARKETS WHERE

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:13.514
THERE IS A DOMINANT INSURER

01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:15.416
ORGANIZATION AND A DOMINANT

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:17.785
PROVIDER ORGANIZATION. OF WHAT

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:20.388
CAN HAPPEN IN THAT CASE IS THE

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:23.391
DOMINANT INSURER CAN AGREE TO A

01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:25.926
VERY HIGH RATE ASKED FOR BY THE

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:27.261
DOMINANT PROVIDER ORGANIZATION

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:28.696
PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY HAVE MOST

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:30.865
MUST HAVE. I MUST HAVE

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:32.900
PROVIDERS IN THEIR SYSTEM. THEY

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:34.068
CAN ASK FOR A VERY HIGH RATE

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:36.303
AND THE INSURER CAN GRANTED AS

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:37.204
LONG AS THE PROVIDER

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:39.306
ORGANIZATION GIVES THEM A MOST

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:41.575
FAVORED NATION CLAUSE. AND THIS

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:43.611
OCCURS SO THEY SAY WILL PAY THE

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:44.645
HIGHEST RATE AS LONG AS YOU

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:45.713
DON'T GIVE ANY OF OUR

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.548
COMPETITORS A BETTER RATE. AND

01:34:47.615 --> 01:34:50.651
WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS THAT THIS

01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:52.553
ALLOWS THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:53.521
TO RISE UP AND THE INSURANCE

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:55.523
COMPANY CAN PASS THOSE COSTS IN

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:57.024
THE FORM OF HIGHER PREMIUMS.

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:58.392
ALONG TO EMPLOYERS AND

01:34:58.459 --> 01:35:01.162
INDIVIDUALS. SO THIS IS AN AREA

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:02.229
WHERE NINETEEN STATES HAVE PRO

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:03.731
HAD PROHIBITED THIS AND THE

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:05.599
STATE OF NEW YORK. REQUIRES ANY

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:07.001
CONTRACT WITH LANGUAGE THAT

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:07.802
LOOKS LIKE A MOST FAVORED

01:35:07.868 --> 01:35:09.703
NATION CLAUSE I TO BE REVIEWED

01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.338
BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER.

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:14.208
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NOW LET'S

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:15.376
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:16.710
RESTRICTION OF ANTI TEARING AN

01:35:16.777 --> 01:35:18.312
ANTI STEERING PROVISIONS THESE

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:19.947
ARE PROVISIONS THAT ARE OFTEN

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:20.714
ASKED FOR BY DOMINANT

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:23.684
PROVIDERS- THAT. PREVENTED THE

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.719
INSURER FROM SIGNALING THAT

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:27.822
THESE PROVIDERS ARE CHARGED

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:29.190
HIGHER PRICES OR MIGHT BE OF

01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:30.825
LOWER VALUE THAN OTHER

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:32.693
PROVIDERS ALSO IN THE NETWORK

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.461
AND SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT

01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:34.995
REALLY SHIELDS. BOTH THE

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:36.464
INSURERS ABILITY TO STEER

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:38.232
PATIENTS TO HIGHER VALUE

01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:39.533
PROVIDERS BUT IT ALSO PREVENTS

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.969
THE IN. THE AB PATIENT FROM

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:43.637
REALLY KNOWING. THAT THE

01:35:43.704 --> 01:35:44.738
PROVIDERS THEY MIGHT BE

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:47.808
PICKING- ARE HIGHER PRICED.

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.643
OVERALL AND SO THEY CONTINUE TO

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:51.445
GO TO THOSE PROVIDERS WHEN THEY

01:35:51.512 --> 01:35:52.813
MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE THEY PAY

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.683
THE SAME COPAY- AS THEY WOULD

01:35:55.749 --> 01:35:56.484
TO GO TO A HIGHER VALUE

01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:58.152
PROVIDER. AND SO WHAT WE CAN

01:35:58.219 --> 01:36:00.054
SEE HERE IS THAT CALIFORNIA AND

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:01.689
NORTH CAROLINA HAD THOSE TWO

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:02.890
CASES THAT CHALLENGED THE USE

01:36:02.957 --> 01:36:05.092
OF THESE. A LAWS AND PROHIBITED

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:06.727
THEM AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:08.362
FOR THOSE THOSE PROVISIONS

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:10.764
MASSACHUSETTS HAS BANNED THE

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:12.633
USE OF ANY TEARING IN ANY

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.001
STEERING CAUSES IN PROVIDER

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:15.769
ENSURE CONTRACTS AND BOTH NEW

01:36:15.836 --> 01:36:17.505
YORK AND NEW JERSEY HAVE BILLS

01:36:17.571 --> 01:36:19.106
CONSIDERING THAT THIS TERM

01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:20.207
NEITHER OF THEM PASSED I THINK

01:36:20.274 --> 01:36:21.475
LARGELY DUE TO CODE BUT THEY'RE

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:23.878
SUPPOSED TO COME BACK. NEXT

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:27.214
YEAR. SO NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:28.415
THE RESTRICTION OF ALL OR

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:30.618
NOTHING PRO PROVISIONS. IN

01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:31.619
CONTRACTS ALL OR NOTHING I

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:33.053
DESCRIBED EARLIER WHERE YOU

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.356
HAVE A MUST HAVE. OF PROVIDER

01:36:35.422 --> 01:36:38.225
POTENTIALLY IN ONE IN ONE AREA

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:39.860
AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY NEEDS

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:40.861
TO HAVE THAT PROVIDER IN THE

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:43.731
SYSTEM. AND THE- HEALTH SYSTEMS

01:36:43.797 --> 01:36:44.732
IN THE NETWORK AND THE HEALTH

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:47.134
SYSTEM IS REQUIRING THAT THAT

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:48.369
INSURER IN ORDER TO GET THE

01:36:48.435 --> 01:36:50.371
MUST HAVE ENTITIES. HAS TO

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:52.740
CONTRACT WITH ALL OF THE

01:36:52.806 --> 01:36:54.742
PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM. AND

01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:56.677
PAY THE RATES DEMANDED BY THE

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:58.579
DOMINANT PROVIDER AND SO. THIS

01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:00.281
PRACTICE WAS CHALLENGED IN THE

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:01.882
SUTTER CASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:03.150
IT WAS PROHIBITED AS PART OF

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:04.685
THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT.

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.187
MASSACHUSETTS HAS LAWS

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:07.288
RESTRICTING THE USE OF THIS

01:37:07.354 --> 01:37:09.023
PRACTICE AND NEW YORK IN

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:11.058
COLORADO ALSO HAD BILLS TRYING

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:12.526
TO ADDRESS THE USE OF ALL OR

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:15.863
NOTHING CLAUSES. AND IN THEIR-

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.431
IN THEIR LEGISLATURES THIS YEAR

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:19.934
TO THOSE DID NOT PASS- AS WELL

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.036
THERE ARE SOME. POTENTIAL

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:23.337
BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:24.805
EFFICIENCIES THAT WOULD COME

01:37:24.872 --> 01:37:25.906
OUT OF ALL OR NOTHING

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:27.474
CONTRACTING AND SO I THINK THIS

01:37:27.541 --> 01:37:28.976
IS IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:29.977
REALLY NEED TO HAVE A GOOD

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:32.179
OVERSIGHT. OVER THE USE OF THIS

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:34.081

BEING USED. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:39.720
SO THOSE ARE JUST AN EXAMPLE OF

01:37:39.787 --> 01:37:40.955
THE KINDS OF LAWS THAT THE

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:42.856

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:45.359
SPECIFIC MARKET IMPERFECTIONS.

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.994
BUT OTHER STATES AND EVEN SOME

OVERALL AND SO THEY'VE DONE

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:52.633
THIS. THROUGH ENHANCING THEIR

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.068
PRICE TRANSPARENCY LAWS

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:55.236

AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE.

01:37:58.839 --> 01:37:59.940
AND THEY'VE ALSO DONE THAT BY

01:38:00.007 --> 01:38:02.176
ENHANCING THEIR MERGER REVIEW

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.845
PRACTICES NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:06.180

REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT. AND WE'VE

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:26.267
CATEGORIZED THOSE LAWS INTO

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:27.601
FIVE DIFFERENT AREAS AS WELL AS

OVERSIGHT. AND THEN WE TOOK THE

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:46.186
STATE'S AND WE PUT WE GROUP

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:48.289

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:56.397
HERE ON THE NEXT SLIDE. IS THAT

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:58.732

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:09.143
EVERYTHING FROM THEY HAVE. NO

01:39:09.209 --> 01:39:11.178

CALIFORNIA. SO AFTER DOING ALL

01:39:42.876 --> 01:39:45.713
THIS RESEARCH WE LOOKED AND

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:46.347
FOUND ON THE NEXT SIDE YOU'LL

01:39:46.413 --> 01:39:47.981

RHODE ISLAND. NO IT'S IMPORTANT

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:01.128
ABOUT THESE IS THAT NONE OF

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:03.197
THESE STATES FULLY ENCAPSULATE

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:04.998
THE GOLD STANDARD ALL OF THEM

01:44:23.423 --> 01:44:25.559
AND AGAIN WHAT WE FOUND WAS

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:27.060
THAT. WE THOUGHT THAT THERE

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:28.395
SHOULD BE A BROAD SET OF NOTICE

01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:29.663
BOTH BROAD IN TERMS OF THE

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.198
SCOPE OF ENTITIES THAT WOULD

01:44:31.264 --> 01:44:32.766
TRIGGER NOTICE BUT ALSO IN THE

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:34.334
SCOPE OF TRANSITIONS.

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.502
TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD TRIGGER

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:36.770
THAT SO NOT JUST MERGERS AND

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:38.105
ACQUISITIONS BUT AGAIN ANY

01:44:38.171 --> 01:44:39.773
MATERIAL CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OR

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.009
CONTROL. WE ALSO THOUGHT THAT

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:43.410
MULTIPLE STATE ENTITIES SHOULD

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:44.878
RECEIVE THIS NOTICE SO THAT I

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:46.213
COULD SHARE THE BURDEN IN TERMS

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:47.881
OF USING THE EXPERTISE REQUIRED

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:50.117
BY OTHER AGENCIES TO HELP

01:44:50.183 --> 01:44:52.285
INFORM THE MERGER DECISION- WE

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:53.387
DID THINK THAT APPROVAL SHOULD

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:55.555
BE HOUSED IN ONE AGENCY ALONE

01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:57.290
BUT JUST INFORMED BY OTHER

01:44:57.357 --> 01:44:58.959
AGENCIES. AND WE THOUGHT THERE

01:44:59.026 --> 01:45:00.027
SHOULD BE A SUFFICIENT WAITING

01:45:00.093 --> 01:45:02.129
PERIOD FOR THE STATE TO REVIEW

01:45:02.195 --> 01:45:03.764
THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:06.433
GATHER MORE INFORMATION. SO

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.034
THAT IT WASN'T A VERY RUSHED

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:10.070
PROCESS. IN TERMS OF REVIEW WE

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:11.371
FELT THAT THERE SHOULD BE

01:45:11.438 --> 01:45:13.507
SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW CRITERIA-

01:45:13.573 --> 01:45:16.109
THAT WAS CODIFIED. SO THAT IT

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:17.411
THE ENTITY TO CONDUCTING THE

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:18.278
REVIEW WOULD REVIEW THE

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:20.280
TRANSACTION TERMS OF ITS IMPACT

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:22.416
ON COMPETITION AND THE MARKETS.

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:25.252
AFFORDABILITY AND PRICES ACCESS

01:45:25.318 --> 01:45:28.021
TO CARE QUALITY OF CARE- AND

01:45:28.088 --> 01:45:30.524
THE PUBLIC INTEREST AS WELL AS

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.659
IF IT'S A NONPROFIT HOSPITAL OF

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:34.761
WHETHER OR NOT THE BOARD. HAD

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:37.464
MET ITS FIDUCIARY DUTY IN TERMS

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:40.167
OF. REVIEWING REVIEWING THE

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:42.102
CRITERIA AND THE TRANSACTION.

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:43.170
NOW WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS A

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:44.738
BIG UNDERTAKING AND IT WOULD BE

01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:46.540
A LOT FOR THE AG'S OFFICE TO

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:48.442
HAVE TO DO ALL OF THIS- OR FOR

01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:49.776
ANOTHER STATE AGENCY TO HAVE TO

01:45:49.843 --> 01:45:50.977
DO ALL OF THIS AND WE THINK

01:45:51.044 --> 01:45:52.145
THAT THERE COULD BE A TIERED

01:45:52.212 --> 01:45:54.648
LEVEL OF REVIEWS SO DEPENDING

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:56.583
ON THE LEVEL OF ANY TRUST RISK

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:58.919
OR THE SIZE OF THE TRANSACTION.

01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:01.455
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. TO HAVE

01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:03.857
LOWER LEVELS OF REVIEW. AND

01:46:03.924 --> 01:46:05.826
INTRODUCE TACIT APPROVAL IF THE

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:08.095
AG'S OFFICE DOES NOT. REJECT OR

01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:09.763
CHALLENGER MARC- YOU KNOW

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:10.897
APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:12.766
INTRODUCED CONDITIONS. ON YOUR

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:13.633
MERGER WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:14.935
OF TIME THAN THE MERGER IS

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:16.336
PRESUMED TO PROVE THINGS LIKE

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:17.104
THAT WHERE YOU CAN KIND OF

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:18.905
SCALE IT ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL

01:46:18.972 --> 01:46:21.208
OF ANTITRUST RISK. WE ALSO FELT

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:22.509
THAT INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:24.444
SHOULD BE PAID FOR- COULD BE

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:25.846
USED IN THIS AND PAID FOR BY

01:46:25.912 --> 01:46:27.748
THE MERGING ENTITIES TO HELP

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:28.548
DEFRAY SOME OF THE COSTS FOR

01:46:28.615 --> 01:46:30.851
THE STATE- WE ALSO FELT THAT IT

01:46:30.917 --> 01:46:32.385
WAS VERY IMPORTANT. TO HAVE

01:46:32.452 --> 01:46:33.920
SUBPOENA FOR THE STATE ENTITIES

01:46:33.987 --> 01:46:35.322
TO HAVE SUBPOENA POWER TO GET

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:37.824
ACCESS TO WHATEVER INFORMATION

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:38.425
THEY NEEDED TO HELP MAKE THEIR

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:40.560
DECISION. WE FELT THAT THE GOLD

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:42.696
STANDARD WOULD ALSO BE. TO HAVE

01:46:42.763 --> 01:46:44.464
PRE TRANSACTION APPROVAL

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:45.465

ATTORNEY GENERAL. OR ANOTHER

01:46:47.734 --> 01:46:50.003
STATE AGENCY- AND AGAIN THIS

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.871
APPROVAL AUTHORITY COULD BE

01:46:50.937 --> 01:46:53.273
TACIT FOR LOWER RISK- BUT MUCH

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.742
MORE ACTUAL FOR- FOR HIGHER

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:57.944
RISK TRANSACTIONS. AND FINALLY

01:46:58.011 --> 01:46:59.045
WE FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD BE IS

01:46:59.112 --> 01:47:00.313
A STRONG AMOUNT OF POST

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:02.082
TRANSACTION MONITORING NOT JUST

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:03.784
FOR THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE ALL

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:06.620
A PART OF THE MERGER BUT ALSO

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:07.187
RETROSPECTIVELY TO MAKE SURE

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:11.658
THAT. A INDIVIDUALS HAD- THAT.

01:47:11.725 --> 01:47:12.626
THE MURDERS THAT HAD GONE

01:47:12.692 --> 01:47:15.228
THROUGH WERE NOT RAISING PRICES

01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:16.463
AND THOSE ENTITIES WERE NOT

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:17.931
EXERCISING THEIR ABUSING THEIR

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:21.668
MARKET POWER. NEXT SLIDE.

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:23.203
FINALLY THIS BRINGS ME TO

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:25.405
MARKET OVERSIGHT AND AGAIN IT I

01:47:25.472 --> 01:47:26.706
WANT TO RAISE THE POINT THAT

01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:27.808
EVERYTHING I JUST TALKED ABOUT

01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:29.609
WAS SORT OF TO PREVENT FURTHER

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:31.778
CONSOLIDATION BUT WE ALSO NEED

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:33.013
TO THINK ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT

01:47:33.079 --> 01:47:34.614
OUR MARKETS ARE ALREADY HEAVILY

01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:35.816
CONSOLIDATED AND WE NEED TO

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:37.417
THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THAT

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:39.719
CONSOLIDATION AND PREVENTED-

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:42.055
FROM CONTINUING TO RAISE COSTS

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:44.257
AND- CHALLENGE OUR- OUR

01:47:44.324 --> 01:47:47.160

01:47:47.227 --> 01:47:48.762
FOR CITIZENS TO GET HEALTH CARE

01:47:48.829 --> 01:47:50.297
SO IN TERMS OF THAT THERE CAN

01:47:50.363 --> 01:47:52.499
BE BETTER MARKET OVERSIGHT SO

01:47:52.566 --> 01:47:54.234

THROUGH THIS TYPE OF OVERSIGHT

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:06.373
SO. AND I APOLOGIZE THERE'S A

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:08.074
COUPLE OF WORDS THAT I WOULD

01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:10.443
CHANGE ON THE SLIDE- SO IN

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:11.745

01:49:20.553 --> 01:49:22.756
EXCEEDS THE THRESHOLD. THE COST

GROWTH BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN

01:49:23.623 --> 01:49:25.325
AMOUNT IN TERMS OF PREMIUMS OR

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:26.293
IN TERMS OF THE RATES BEING

01:49:26.359 --> 01:49:27.794
PAID THEN THE INSURANCE

COMMISSIONER IN RHODE ISLAND

01:49:39.572 --> 01:49:41.942
A GOOD LARGE- IT'S A LARGE

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:43.510
INCREASE IN AUTHORITY. FOR

MASSACHUSETTS AND DELAWARE. AND

01:49:52.085 --> 01:49:52.819
I THINK THAT CAN BE VERY

01:49:52.886 --> 01:49:54.020
EFFECTIVE AT TRYING TO

01:50:00.226 --> 01:50:02.128
BE A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL WE'VE

01:50:02.195 --> 01:50:04.364
ALSO SEEN RATE CAPS. IN THE

QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE

01:51:47.534 --> 01:51:48.301
ANSWERED SOME OF THEM I HAD

MIGHT HAVE MISSED SOME OF IT SO

01:51:51.304 --> 01:51:52.906
EXCUSE ME IF YOU ANSWER SOME OF

01:51:52.972 --> 01:51:55.775
THESE- SOME OF THE FIVE STATES

WITH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE.

01:51:57.477 --> 01:51:59.813
POLICIES I UNDERSTAND THAT NONE

01:51:59.879 --> 01:52:02.682
OF THEM ARE THE GOLD STANDARD.

01:52:02.749 --> 01:52:04.617
AT WHICH ONES ARE HAVING THE

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:06.119
MOST SUCCESS AND HOW ARE YOU

01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:11.224
MY SECOND QUESTION IS- HOW DOES

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:13.827
THIS ALL. I AM VERY SENSITIVE

01:52:13.893 --> 01:52:17.163

01:52:20.033 --> 01:52:21.134
PORTIONS OF MY DISTRICT AT THE

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:23.203
TIME SUFFERED FROM. A HOSPITAL

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:25.338
DESERT'S. WHERE WE DON'T HAVE

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:26.139
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND WE

01:52:26.206 --> 01:52:27.807
DID HAVE. ONE OF THESE

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:30.210
COMPANIES THAT YES- WE HAD A TO

01:52:30.276 --> 01:52:31.911
FINALLY IN MY DISTRICT COME IN.

01:52:31.978 --> 01:52:33.847
THAT DO YOU KNOW THAT ARE THAT

01:52:33.913 --> 01:52:35.048
ARE LARGER CORPORATIONS THAT

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:37.217
HAVE COME IN AND- WE'RE HAPPY

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:39.752
TO HAVE THEM. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

01:52:39.819 --> 01:52:40.720
HAVE THESE HEALTH HAZARDS AND

01:52:40.787 --> 01:52:42.122
WE STILL ARE SUFFERING I THINK

01:52:42.188 --> 01:52:43.656
NOT YOU KNOW FROM THE APP FROM

01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:45.758
A LOW AVERAGE ON HEALTH CARE

01:52:45.825 --> 01:52:48.461
AVAILABILITY IN OUR DISTRICT.

01:52:48.528 --> 01:52:50.463
AND SO. MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:51.331
THAT AFFECT DISTRICTS LIKE

01:52:51.397 --> 01:52:53.233
MINE. WHERE WE STRUGGLE WITH

01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:54.901
ACCESS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:57.070
PRICES THE PRICES ARE BAD

01:52:57.137 --> 01:52:57.704
ENOUGH BUT BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS

01:52:57.770 --> 01:53:00.540
TO COME. OR THAT WE FIND IT

01:53:00.607 --> 01:53:02.442
DIFFICULT TO FIND THOSE THAT

01:53:02.509 --> 01:53:06.346
WILL COME TO OUR DISTRICTS AND.

01:53:06.412 --> 01:53:07.380
BUT THANK YOU THOSE ARE GREAT

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:09.115
QUESTIONS SO IN TERMS OF THE

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:11.017
STATES THAT ARE HAVING THE MOST

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:14.220
SUCCESS- I WOULD I WOULD PICK

01:53:14.287 --> 01:53:16.823
OUT MASSACHUSETTS CONNECTICUT

01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:17.991
AND RHODE ISLAND IN SOME WAYS

01:53:18.057 --> 01:53:18.658
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:20.493
MASSACHUSETTS- WITH ITS HEALTH

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:23.029
POLICY COMMISSION REALLY HAS-

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:25.298
THE BEST OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT'S

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:27.233
HAPPENING IN ITS MARKETS. AND

01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:29.235
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT

01:53:29.302 --> 01:53:31.337
THEIR- THEIR HEALTHCARE COST

01:53:31.404 --> 01:53:34.474
GROWTH. THRESHOLDS AND I THINK

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:37.076
THAT'S BEEN- THAT'S BEEN VERY

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:38.978
EFFECTIVE THAT HEALTH POLICY

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:41.681
COMMISSION HAS BEEN ABLE TO USE

01:53:41.748 --> 01:53:43.149
ITS ACCESS TO DATA AND ITS

01:53:43.216 --> 01:53:45.418
ANALYSIS OF DATA TO PREVENT ANY

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:47.654
COMPETITIVE MERGERS- IN CERTAIN

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.422
INSTANCES BUT THEN ALSO TO

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:50.857
ALLOW MERGERS THAT GOES WITH TO

01:53:50.924 --> 01:53:52.859
GO THROUGH BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT

01:53:52.926 --> 01:53:55.461
CONDITIONS THAT- ARE GOING TO.

01:53:55.528 --> 01:53:56.996
HOPEFULLY PREVENT AT LEAST FOR

01:53:57.063 --> 01:53:59.132
SOME AMOUNT OF TIME OF THE

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:00.767
KINDS OF BEHAVIORS ANY

01:54:00.833 --> 01:54:02.468
COMPETITIVE RESULTS THAT WE'VE

01:54:02.535 --> 01:54:04.337
SEEN IN OTHER PLACES RHODE

01:54:04.404 --> 01:54:06.573
ISLAND HAS DONE THAT- THROUGH

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:08.608
ITS AFFORDABILITY STANDARDS HAS

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:10.944
BEEN ABLE TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW

01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:12.712
IT'S PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP AND

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:15.815
REDUCE ITS OVERALL COST GROWTH.

01:54:15.882 --> 01:54:17.917
WHICH HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:19.519
IN PART BY HAVING USING THESE

01:54:19.586 --> 01:54:21.387
AFFORDABILITY STANDARDS AND

01:54:21.454 --> 01:54:23.790
ALLOWING THAT HEALTH INSURANCE

01:54:23.856 --> 01:54:26.859
COMMISSIONER TO REALLY. GO INTO

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:28.962
AND REJECT THE CONTRACTS

01:54:29.028 --> 01:54:30.697
BETWEEN INSURERS AND PROVIDERS

01:54:30.763 --> 01:54:32.065
BASED ON THESE PREMIUM

01:54:32.131 --> 01:54:35.101
INCREASES AS WELL AS- REJECTING

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:36.769
THE PROVIDER RATE AND SO THAT'S

01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:38.338
THAT THREAT BEING OUT THERE

01:54:38.404 --> 01:54:39.839
ALLOWS INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:41.774
PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE. ON

01:54:41.841 --> 01:54:43.409
PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF PRICE AND

01:54:43.476 --> 01:54:45.178
THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST ONE

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:45.778
STUDY OF THAT SYSTEM THAT HAS

01:54:45.845 --> 01:54:49.182
SHOWN. A REDUCTION IN PRICE SO

01:54:49.249 --> 01:54:50.883
I THINK THAT'S BEEN- VERY

01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:54.621
EFFECTIVE. AS WELL IN TERMS OF

01:54:54.687 --> 01:54:56.623
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW ALL OF

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:58.658
THIS WITH HELP OF. THE COUNTIES

01:54:58.725 --> 01:54:59.859
IN WHICH YOU THE COUNTY IN

01:54:59.926 --> 01:55:01.127
WHICH YOU GREW UP AND WHERE

01:55:01.194 --> 01:55:02.428
THERE'S AYE HEALTHCARE DESERT

01:55:02.495 --> 01:55:04.697
WHAT WE WANT IS FOR THERE TO

01:55:04.764 --> 01:55:07.400
BE- THE ABILITY FOR NEW

01:55:07.467 --> 01:55:08.968
ENTRANTS TO COME INTO THE

01:55:09.035 --> 01:55:10.903
MARKET AND FOR THERE TO BE

01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:13.539
LOWER AM. IT WOULD BE MUCH

01:55:13.606 --> 01:55:15.041
EASIER FOR THOSE AND ENTITIES

01:55:15.108 --> 01:55:16.075
TO COMMITTING FOR COMPETITION

01:55:16.142 --> 01:55:17.543
TO COME IN AND A LOT OF TIMES

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:18.578
WHAT HAPPENS IT'S VERY

01:55:18.645 --> 01:55:20.713
DIFFICULT. FOR NEW PROVIDERS TO

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:23.616
COME IN. BECAUSE THE DOMINANT

01:55:23.683 --> 01:55:25.685
PROVIDERS IN A PARTICULAR AREA

01:55:25.752 --> 01:55:27.754
OR IF THERE ARE- JUST REALLY

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.289
LIMITED NUMBERS OF PROVIDERS

01:55:29.355 --> 01:55:31.057
THEY ARE CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE.

01:55:31.124 --> 01:55:34.360
AT PREVENTING INSURERS FROM

01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:36.829
BEING ABLE TO. PAY THEM HIGHER

01:55:36.896 --> 01:55:38.031
REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND SO

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:39.899
THERE'S A WHOLE SYSTEM OF KIND

01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:41.801
OF EXCLUDING RIVALS IN THIS

01:55:41.868 --> 01:55:44.570
SPACE- BY DOMINANT PROVIDERS

01:55:44.637 --> 01:55:47.640
AND SO. HAVING GREATER

01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:49.075
OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:55:49.142 --> 01:55:51.210
IN THE MARKET CAN LOWER THE

01:55:51.277 --> 01:55:54.247
OVER ARCHING- THAT THRESHOLD

01:55:54.314 --> 01:55:56.616
OUR BOUNDARY FOR GETTING INTO

01:55:56.683 --> 01:55:59.085
THE MARKET FOR NEW COMPETITORS

01:55:59.152 --> 01:55:59.652
AND SO THAT CAN ALSO HELP IN

01:55:59.719 --> 01:56:03.823
THAT SPACE. GO AHEAD PLEASE. I

01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:05.291
GET THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT BUT

01:56:05.358 --> 01:56:07.093
I'M I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:09.329
DO WE HOW DO YOU PAIR OF THAT

01:56:09.395 --> 01:56:11.097
TOO BECAUSE I MEAN I LIVE IN A

01:56:11.164 --> 01:56:11.731
DISTRICT THAT CLEARLY WE HAD A

01:56:11.798 --> 01:56:14.767
HOT WE HAD. TO HOSPITALS CLOSE

01:56:14.834 --> 01:56:16.936
AND SO WHAT WE WANTED IT WASN'T

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:19.539
ACTUALLY POSSIBLE WHAT WE FOUND

01:56:19.605 --> 01:56:23.343
WAS THAT. WE HAD NO HEALTH CARE-

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:24.744
AND PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT DON'T

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:26.179
HAVE CARS IT'S FOUR HOURS

01:56:26.245 --> 01:56:27.580
SOMETIMES ON A BUS TO GET

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:29.482
HEALTH CARE AND THAT'S- NOT

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:30.983
WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR IT'S NOT

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:33.252
WHAT I WANT FOR MY FAMILY OR-

01:56:33.319 --> 01:56:34.854
THOSE AROUND ME MY NEIGHBORS-

01:56:34.921 --> 01:56:37.156
SO HOW DO WE PAIR OF THIS WHAT

01:56:37.223 --> 01:56:39.692
WE WANT WITH WHAT. WE ACTUALLY

01:56:39.759 --> 01:56:41.694
WHAT ACTUALLY FACILITATES NOT

01:56:41.761 --> 01:56:43.296
JUST THE HOPE THAT IT GIVES

01:56:43.363 --> 01:56:45.231
SPACE FOR THOSE TO COME IN WHO

01:56:45.298 --> 01:56:47.066
DO WHO WHAT REALLY DON'T REALLY

01:56:47.133 --> 01:56:47.900
WANT TO COME INTO OUR

01:56:47.967 --> 01:56:49.836
DISTRICTS. REIMBURSEMENT RATES

01:56:49.902 --> 01:56:51.371
ARE LOW WE ARE NOT THE IDEAL

01:56:51.437 --> 01:56:54.006
SITUATION FOR MOST HEALTH CARE

01:56:54.073 --> 01:57:12.625
COMPANIES.

01:57:27.206 --> 01:57:37.283
UHHUH. DID YOU WERE

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:41.721
YOU ABLE TO HEAR THE QUESTION.

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:42.288
YES I CAN HEAR THE QUESTION

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:47.560
OKAY. OPEN UP CAN YOU HEAR ME

01:57:47.627 --> 01:57:50.363
SORRY WE'RE HAVING AT. WE CAN

01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:52.532
HEAR YOU NOW I DELAY ON THAT ON

01:57:52.598 --> 01:57:54.700
THAT CAMERA MIGHT ANYWAY SO I

01:57:54.767 --> 01:57:56.335
THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND

01:57:56.402 --> 01:57:58.337
I THINK THE REALITY IS WE HAVE

01:57:58.404 --> 01:58:00.239
MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH

01:58:00.306 --> 01:58:01.641
CARE CHALLENGES AND THEY'RE NOT

01:58:01.707 --> 01:58:04.977
GOING TO BE SOLVED WITH ONE-

01:58:05.044 --> 01:58:07.513
WITH ONE SOLUTION. I HONESTLY

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:08.981
THINK THAT FOR RURAL MARKETS

01:58:09.048 --> 01:58:10.249
WHERE WE DON'T ARE JUST FOR

01:58:10.316 --> 01:58:12.952
AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE GOOD

01:58:13.019 --> 01:58:15.221
AND APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE.

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:17.557
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FOLLOW

01:58:17.623 --> 01:58:19.158
THE LEAD OR LOOK MORE CLOSELY

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:20.726
AT WHAT PENNSYLVANIA HAS DONE

01:58:20.793 --> 01:58:24.063
IN THAT SPACE BY CREATING.

01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:26.666
ESSENTIALLY TREATING TREATING

01:58:26.732 --> 01:58:28.501
HEALTH CARE IN THOSE SPACES

01:58:28.568 --> 01:58:30.870
LIKE A PUBLIC UTILITY AND SAY

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:32.371
THAT THOUGH THEY HAVE CREATED

01:58:32.438 --> 01:58:34.440
BOTH A FLOOR AND A CEILING FOR

01:58:34.507 --> 01:58:35.708
WHAT COULD BE PAID WHAT THE

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:37.443
STATE WOULD PAY. TO PROVIDE

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:40.446
CARE AT IN THOSE SPACES AND

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:41.614
THINKING ABOUT IT IN THE SAME

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:43.349
WAY AS A PUBLIC UTILITY THAT

01:58:43.416 --> 01:58:44.917
PEOPLE LIVING IN THOSE AREAS

01:58:44.984 --> 01:58:46.319
NEED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:47.453
THE SAME WAY THAT THEY NEED

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:48.855
ACCESS TO SCHOOLS THEY NEED

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:50.323
ACCESS TO BE WANTING TO HAVE

01:58:50.389 --> 01:58:51.657
ACCESS TO THE INTERNET WE WANT

01:58:51.724 --> 01:58:52.692
THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO A WHOLE

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:54.060
LOT OF THINGS AND THEY'RE-

01:58:54.126 --> 01:58:54.627

LINES. I'M SO TREATING HEALTH

01:58:56.863 --> 01:58:59.165
CARE IN MORE RURAL AREAS IN

01:58:59.232 --> 01:59:00.733
HEALTH CARE DESERT AS A PUBLIC

CERTAIN FLOOR FOR AMOUNT OF

01:59:06.072 --> 01:59:07.840
MONEY. THAT CAN REALLY CHANGE

01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:09.442
THE DYNAMC IN THAT SPACE AND

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:15.815
ANTI BUT YOU HAVE TO TREAT SORT

OF THOSE TYPES OF PROBLEMS VERY

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:19.685
DIFFERENTLY FROM THE TYPES OF

01:59:19.752 --> 01:59:20.319
PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN

01:59:20.386 --> 01:59:22.021

GETS A D. OREGON GETS A C.

01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:54.053
WASHINGTON GETS A D. BUT MADE

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:55.788
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE GET ON A- WHAT

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:56.856
ARE THEY DOING IN MAINE AND NEW

01:59:56.923 --> 01:59:58.925
HAMPSHIRE. THERE WERE NOT DOING

01:59:58.991 --> 02:00:05.331
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S A IT'S

02:00:05.398 --> 02:00:06.766
A GREAT QUESTION SO MAINE AND

02:00:06.832 --> 02:00:09.869
NEW HAMPSHIRE HAVE BEEN- THE

02:00:09.936 --> 02:00:11.437
LEADERS IN HEALTHCARE PRICE

02:00:11.504 --> 02:00:12.972
TRANSPARENCY AND THEY HAVE FOR

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:14.941
YEARS. AND PART OF WHAT THEY DO

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.108
THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AS THEY

02:00:16.175 --> 02:00:17.777
HAVE PUBLIC FACING WEBSITES

02:00:17.843 --> 02:00:19.345
WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN GO

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:22.248
ONLINE. AND PUT IN THEIR HEALTH

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:24.450
PLAN AT LEAST IN. IN NEW

02:00:24.517 --> 02:00:25.084
HAMPSHIRE THEY HAVE THAT THEY

02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:26.786
CAN THEY CAN GO ONLINE PUT IN

02:00:26.852 --> 02:00:30.022
THEIR HEALTH PLAN- AND- FIND

02:00:30.089 --> 02:00:31.390
OUT HOW MUCH A CERTAIN

02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:33.426
PROCEDURE IS GOING COST. A

02:00:33.492 --> 02:00:35.695
DIFFERENT FACILITIES AROUND THE

02:00:35.761 --> 02:00:38.764
STATE AND SO THAT IS AND IT'S

02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:42.301
BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE. FOR THEM

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:44.236
AND IT OFFERS THAT THE PATIENTS

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.672
MUCH MORE- TRANSPARENCY INTO

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:47.740
THAT SPACE THEY MADE VERY

02:00:47.807 --> 02:00:48.908
EFFECTIVE USE OF THEIR ALL

02:00:48.975 --> 02:00:50.943
PAYER CLAIMS DATABASES. THEY

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:53.412
ALSO PROVIDE OF REPORTS AND

02:00:53.479 --> 02:00:55.648
INFORMATION TO POLICYMAKERS-

02:00:55.715 --> 02:00:57.550
AND TO THE PUBLIC BASED ON WHAT

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:59.151
THEY HAVE IN THEIR DATABASE BUT

02:00:59.218 --> 02:00:59.819
THEY'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:01.887
THIS AND WORKING ON IT FROM FOR

02:01:01.954 --> 02:01:04.190
MANY MANY YEARS. NOW THAT

02:01:04.256 --> 02:01:05.992
REPORT CARD IS MAINLY FOCUSED

02:01:06.058 --> 02:01:07.693
ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION FOR

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:10.029
CONSUMERS AND I THINK THAT IN

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:11.964
THE NEXT YEAR WILL BE WILL BE

02:01:12.031 --> 02:01:13.265
CHANGING IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:17.069
MAKING IT MUCH MORE- POLICY

02:01:17.136 --> 02:01:18.237
ENFORCEMENT RELATED SO THAT.

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:21.607
THE- THE GRADATIONS WILL BE

02:01:21.674 --> 02:01:23.342
MADE ABOUT HOW MUCH INFORMATION

02:01:23.409 --> 02:01:25.144
GOES TO IS AVAILABLE ALSO TO

02:01:25.211 --> 02:01:26.846
POLICY MAKERS AND ACADEMICS AND

02:01:26.912 --> 02:01:28.414
OTHER PEOPLE NOT JUST CONSUMERS

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:28.981
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S MOSTLY

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:30.850
ABOUT IS THAT THEY HAVE PUBLIC

02:01:30.916 --> 02:01:31.984
FACING WEBSITES WHERE PEOPLE

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:34.020
CAN GET- INFORMATION IN REAL

02:01:34.086 --> 02:01:35.721
TIME HELPING THEM ESTIMATE HOW

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:38.591
MUCH IT WILL BE FOR THEIR

02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:39.225
HEALTH PLAN TO GO TO PARTICULAR

02:01:39.291 --> 02:01:42.428
PROVIDERS. THAT WOULD BE REALLY

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:44.530
HELPFUL QUITE FRANKLY I THINK-

02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:45.798
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANDY AT ONE

02:01:45.865 --> 02:01:47.600
POINT IN THE- HEARING WE HAD

02:01:47.667 --> 02:01:49.502
SAID IT'S- EASIER TO FIND OUT

02:01:49.568 --> 02:01:50.870
WHAT YOU WHAT YOU MIGHT PAY TO

02:01:50.936 --> 02:01:52.204
HAVE OUR DOG TREATED AT A

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:53.939
VETERINARIAN. THAT IS WHAT YOU

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:55.741
MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR

02:01:55.808 --> 02:01:57.810
DOCTOR'S OFFICE- AND THAT'S-

02:01:57.877 --> 02:01:59.078
THAT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATE

02:01:59.145 --> 02:02:01.847
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE SO- DO YOU

02:02:01.914 --> 02:02:03.616
DO YOU THINK. INCREASING

02:02:03.683 --> 02:02:06.185
PRICES. THROUGHOUT CONSOLIDATED

02:02:06.252 --> 02:02:08.554
MARKETS. HAS AN EFFECT ON

02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:10.723
INDEPENDENT PRACTICES THESE ARE

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:12.758
SORT OF THAT WHICH ARE THERE

02:02:12.825 --> 02:02:13.325
AREN'T VERY MANY THESE DAYS

02:02:13.392 --> 02:02:15.928
OBVIOUSLY BUT- DO YOU THINK

02:02:15.995 --> 02:02:16.529
THERE'S A TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT

02:02:16.595 --> 02:02:18.631
THERE BECAUSE- AS I WAS AN

02:02:18.698 --> 02:02:20.599
INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER- IN

02:02:20.666 --> 02:02:22.501
THE FIELD OF DENTISTRY. AND I

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:23.469
COULDN'T JUST CALL OUT MY

02:02:23.536 --> 02:02:25.004
COMPETITOR AND SAY HEY WOULD

02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:28.574
YOU CHARGING FOR THIS- AND-

02:02:28.641 --> 02:02:29.709
THAT WAS THAT THAT'S AN ANTI

02:02:29.775 --> 02:02:33.312
TRUST VIOLATIONS SO. BUT IS

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:35.681
THERE'S IS THE CONSOLIDATION

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:37.817
LEADING TO AN UPTICK IN PRICES.

02:02:37.883 --> 02:02:39.285
WITH SMALL IT WITH WITH

02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:40.453
INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS

02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:51.130
VERSUS LARGE GROUPS AND SO ON.

02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:53.199
SO I THINK I THINK THAT THERE

02:02:53.265 --> 02:02:55.568
IS A GENERAL UPTICK SO I

02:02:55.634 --> 02:02:56.602
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW

02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:58.504
INDEPENDENT PROBE AT PHYSICIANS

02:02:58.571 --> 02:03:00.439
CAN'T JUST CALL UP AND FIND OUT

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:02.174
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE. ARE CHARGING

02:03:02.241 --> 02:03:04.677
BUT AS THE MARKET GOES UP

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:07.847
OVERALL- WE ARE SEEING YOU KNOW

02:03:07.913 --> 02:03:09.749
PRICES RISE IN GENERAL ACROSS

02:03:09.815 --> 02:03:10.616
THE BOARD AND WE SEE THIS A

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:12.818
FACT- WITH KAISER PERMANENTE IN

02:03:12.885 --> 02:03:14.487
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I REALIZE A

02:03:14.553 --> 02:03:16.288
VERY VERY LARGE PLAYER BUT

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:19.125
THEY'RE NOT- BUT THEY HAVE.

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:20.760
THEIR THEIR PRICES IN NORTHERN

02:03:20.826 --> 02:03:22.561
CALIFORNIA SORT OF SHADOW PRICE

02:03:22.628 --> 02:03:24.396
WHAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING- IN SOME

02:03:24.463 --> 02:03:26.699
OF THE BIGGER SYSTEMS- AND

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:27.633
THEIR LIVES TO THEIR HIGHER IN

02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:28.834
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAN THEY

02:03:28.901 --> 02:03:30.736
ARE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:03:30.803 --> 02:03:31.871
I THINK THAT IS IN SOME WAYS

02:03:31.937 --> 02:03:33.706
TRUE NOW THE OTHER THE FLIP

02:03:33.773 --> 02:03:34.774
SIDE OF THAT COIN IS THAT FOR

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.842
SOME INDEPENDENT PHYSICIANS.

02:03:36.909 --> 02:03:37.777
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A PART OF

02:03:37.843 --> 02:03:39.812
THE SYSTEM INSURANCE COMPANIES

02:03:39.879 --> 02:03:42.014
CAN PUSH DOWN ON THEIR PRICES

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:42.915
PRETTY HEAVILY BECAUSE THEY

02:03:42.982 --> 02:03:44.316
DON'T HAVE THE MARKET POWER TO

02:03:44.383 --> 02:03:45.918
REALLY PUSH BACK. AND SO YOU

02:03:45.985 --> 02:03:47.486
CAN SEE DIFFERENT EFFECTS LIKE

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:49.889
THEY MAY BE AS A WHOLE RAISING

02:03:49.955 --> 02:03:50.689
THEIR PRICES BUT THEY'RE

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:52.591
GETTING PAID. LESS THAN THEY

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.527
OTHERWISE MIGHT BE BECAUSE

02:03:54.593 --> 02:03:55.461
INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN PUSH

02:03:55.528 --> 02:03:57.530
DOWN ON THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:03:57.596 --> 02:03:59.131
AND I AM. THEN THE OTHER IS

02:03:59.198 --> 02:03:59.932
GOOD SO I THINK THERE'S SORT

02:03:59.999 --> 02:04:02.168
OF. TWO SIDES OF THAT COIN

02:04:02.234 --> 02:04:02.735
THAT'S HAPPENING AND I'M NOT

02:04:02.802 --> 02:04:05.070
REALLY SURE. WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:07.239
IN ANY PARTICULAR SITUATION.

02:04:07.306 --> 02:04:08.140
LET'S HAVE A COUPLE OTHER

02:04:08.207 --> 02:04:09.575
QUESTIONS IN IN THERE THEY

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:11.410
SHOULD BE PRETTY QUICK- YOU

02:04:11.477 --> 02:04:13.612
MENTIONED IN IN YOUR AND OF THE

02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:14.713
FIVE STATE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.015
I SAW A PHRASE COME UP I'D

02:04:16.081 --> 02:04:18.017
NEVER SEEN BEFORE THAT'S THE

02:04:18.083 --> 02:04:21.086
CERTIFICATE OF NEED AGENCY CAN

02:04:21.153 --> 02:04:27.059
YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS. YES

02:04:27.126 --> 02:04:28.394
SO CERTIFICATE OF NEED

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:33.399
AGENCIES- ARE IN. I BELIEVE.

02:04:33.465 --> 02:04:35.100
THEY WERE VERY POPULAR IN THE

02:04:35.167 --> 02:04:35.968
NINETIES I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE

02:04:36.035 --> 02:04:37.136
PROBABLY IN LIKE FIFTEEN TO

02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:38.504
TWENTY STATES NOW AND THEY WERE

02:04:38.571 --> 02:04:40.973
DESIGN WHEN A LOT OF HEALTH

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.274
POLICY CONCERNS WERE AROUND

02:04:42.341 --> 02:04:43.809
UTILIZATION WE HAD FEE FOR

02:04:43.876 --> 02:04:45.611
SERVICE MEDICINE PEOPLE WERE

02:04:45.678 --> 02:04:47.379
PROVIDING LOTS MORE CARE AND

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:50.015
THE- THE DATA WAS TELLING IN

02:04:50.082 --> 02:04:51.584
HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCHERS

02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:54.587
THAT THE MORE BEDS THERE WERE

02:04:54.653 --> 02:04:55.354
THE MORE SURGERIES THAT WERE

02:04:55.421 --> 02:04:57.056
BEING DONE IN THE MORGUE CARE

02:04:57.122 --> 02:05:00.459
WAS BEING PROVIDED AND SO AS A

02:05:00.526 --> 02:05:03.696
AS A- AS A PRACTICE STATE START

02:05:03.762 --> 02:05:04.930
PASSING CERTIFICATE OF NEED

02:05:04.997 --> 02:05:07.266
LAWS. THAT WOULD REQUIRE BEFORE

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:09.535
I HEALTH A HOSPITAL OR A HEALTH

02:05:09.602 --> 02:05:12.438
CARE ENTITY COULD EXPAND EITHER

02:05:12.504 --> 02:05:14.840
BY THROUGH ACQUISITION OR BY.

02:05:14.907 --> 02:05:16.575
BUILDING A NEW BUILDING THEY

02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:17.743
HAD TO GET A CERTIFICATE OF

02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:19.011
NEED SHOWING THAT THERE WAS

02:05:19.078 --> 02:05:19.912
SUFFICIENT NEED IN THE

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:23.082
COMMUNITY. TO- THERE ARE

02:05:23.148 --> 02:05:24.283
SIGNIFICANT NEED IN THE

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:26.151
COMMUNITY TO WARRANT THE

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:27.720
INCREASE THAT AND SHE SAID THAT

02:05:27.786 --> 02:05:29.288
YOU WOULDN'T JUST BE EXPANDING

02:05:29.355 --> 02:05:31.290
UTILIZATION FOR NO NEED. NOW

02:05:31.357 --> 02:05:32.391
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT

02:05:32.458 --> 02:05:33.626
THESE HAVE KIND OF FALLEN OUT

02:05:33.692 --> 02:05:35.361
OF FAVOR AND THE THOUGHT HAS

02:05:35.427 --> 02:05:36.929
BEEN OVER TIME THAT THEY WERE

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:38.497
BEING USED IN ANY COMPETITIVE

02:05:38.564 --> 02:05:41.033
WAYS BECAUSE EXISTING HEALTH

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.935
SYSTEMS COULD CHALLENGE.

02:05:43.002 --> 02:05:46.138
ARRIVALS CERTIFICATE OF NEED

02:05:46.205 --> 02:05:47.539
APPLICATION AND COULD COME IN

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:48.607
AND THEY- THEY DON'T NEED THAT

02:05:48.674 --> 02:05:50.142
EXTRA BED SPACE WE'VE GOT IT

02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:52.745
COVERED HERE AND AS IT. AND AS

02:05:52.811 --> 02:05:54.313
A MECHANISM TO SORT OF KEEP

02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:55.581
MARKET POWER FROM GROWING

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:57.383
UNDERNEATH THEIR RIVALS WHAT

02:05:57.449 --> 02:05:59.818
WE'VE SEEN IS THAT SOME STATES

02:05:59.885 --> 02:06:01.553
HAVE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.923
USING THIS. APPROVAL PROCESS

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.724
THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE WITHIN

02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:08.594
THE STATE. TO THEN SAY WELL IF

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:09.762
YOU WANT TO ENGAGE IN THIS

02:06:09.828 --> 02:06:11.931
MERGER OR ACQUISITION WE HAVE

02:06:11.997 --> 02:06:13.065
TO YOU HAVE TO TELL US MORE

02:06:13.132 --> 02:06:14.099
ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT

02:06:14.166 --> 02:06:16.001
COMPETITION HOW IT'S GOING TO

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:18.203
IMPACT PRICES AND THEY'VE USED

02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:19.505
IT TO COVER. COMPETITIVE

02:06:19.571 --> 02:06:21.640
CONCERNS AND THEY DO HAVE AN

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:22.841
APPROVAL PROCESS IN PLACE TO

02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:24.009
SOME STATES ARE LOOKING AT IT

02:06:24.076 --> 02:06:25.577
THAT WAY NOT ALL OF THEM ARE

02:06:25.644 --> 02:06:27.046
BUT THAT'S SORT OF. THE HISTORY

02:06:27.112 --> 02:06:28.247
OF THEM THEY SORT OF FELL OUT

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:29.481
OF FAVOR AND NOW THEY'RE BEING

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:32.518
USED- AS A MECHANISM TO CONTROL

02:06:32.584 --> 02:06:34.753
CONSOLIDATION AND PRICES BY

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.755
SOME STATES LIKE CONNECTICUT.

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:38.791
GREAT THANK YOU. THEY MIGHT MY

02:06:38.857 --> 02:06:40.859
FINAL QUESTION AND- IT YOU KNOW

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:43.062
WELL IT'S TO ME IT'S VERY CLEAR

02:06:43.128 --> 02:06:45.397
THE CONSOLIDATION IS LEADING TO

02:06:45.464 --> 02:06:48.033
HIGHER. HEALTHCARE PRICES- ARE

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:49.735
YOU WHERE OTHER FACTORS THAT

02:06:49.802 --> 02:06:52.538
ARE INFLUENCING THE RISING

02:06:52.604 --> 02:07:00.045
HEALTH CARE COSTS. SURE YES I

02:07:00.112 --> 02:07:01.547
MEAN I THINK THAT TO SAY THAT

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:03.382
CONSOLIDATION IS THE ONLY

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:05.050
DRIVER OF HEALTH CARE PRICES

02:07:05.117 --> 02:07:07.553
WOULD BE- NOT TOO I DO THINK

02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:09.121
THAT IT IS THE MAJOR DRIVER AND

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:10.656
A MAJOR DRIVER BUT I THINK WE

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:13.826
ALSO SEE- THAT PRICES ARE BEING

02:07:13.892 --> 02:07:17.196
DRIVEN BY. YOU KNOW THE COST OF

02:07:17.262 --> 02:07:18.397
OVERALL YOU KNOW THE COST OF

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:19.598
PROVIDING CARE IN A CERTAIN

02:07:19.665 --> 02:07:21.467
AREA SO IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE

02:07:21.533 --> 02:07:23.068
JUST IN GENERAL TO PROVIDE TO

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:24.603
HAVE. HOSPITALS AND RUN

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:25.637
HOSPITALS IN A PLACE LIKE SAN

02:07:25.704 --> 02:07:27.773
FRANCISCO THAN IT IS- IN OTHER

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:30.576
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY- IT'S ALSO

02:07:30.642 --> 02:07:32.644
IT'S ALSO EXPENSIVE AND WE HAVE

02:07:32.711 --> 02:07:35.381
A POPULATION THAT IS NOT- MAYBE

02:07:35.447 --> 02:07:37.049
AS HEALTHY AS OTHER OPULATIONS

02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:38.150
AND SO THE CASE MIX IS

02:07:38.217 --> 02:07:39.885
IMPORTANT TO BE LOOKING AT. WE

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:41.453
HAVE AN AGING POPULATION THEIR

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:42.788
RANGE OF THINGS PHARMACEUTICAL

02:07:42.855 --> 02:07:44.156
DRUGS ARE REALLY DRIVING THE

02:07:44.223 --> 02:07:45.290
PRICE OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS

02:07:45.357 --> 02:07:46.892
ARE ALSO DRIVING HEALTHCARE.

02:07:46.959 --> 02:07:49.528
PRICES UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND SO

02:07:49.595 --> 02:07:51.130
I THINK TO SAY THAT THE ONLY

02:07:51.196 --> 02:07:52.197
THING THAT'S HAPPENING WITH

02:07:52.264 --> 02:07:53.465
HEALTH CARE PRICES IN THE

02:07:53.532 --> 02:07:56.568
UNITED STATES ITS COMPETITION-

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:58.103
YOU KNOW IT IS JUST IS NOT

02:07:58.170 --> 02:07:59.304
CORRECT THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:00.539
THAT ARE HAPPENING. BUT

02:08:00.606 --> 02:08:01.840
CONSOLIDATION AND COMPETITION

02:08:01.907 --> 02:08:03.909
IS A MAJOR FACTOR AND IT'S ONE

02:08:03.976 --> 02:08:05.210
THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET

02:08:05.277 --> 02:08:07.513
CONTROL OVER- AS OPPOSED TO

02:08:07.579 --> 02:08:08.680
THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO

02:08:08.747 --> 02:08:10.816
ABOUT OUR AGING POPULATION OR

02:08:10.883 --> 02:08:12.951
