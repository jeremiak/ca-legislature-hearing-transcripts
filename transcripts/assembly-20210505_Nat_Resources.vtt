THANK YOU WHEN I CAN ASK YOU

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:29.112
WHERE PREVIOUS BONDS HAVE BEEN

00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:31.548
SPENT THAT'S MY JOB TO FIGURE

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:34.551
OUT NOT YOURS ON ON THIS THEN

00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:35.685
I'LL GIVE YOU A GREAT EXAMPLE

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:38.755
OF PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:40.156
BOND MONEY IN THE PAST AND THAT

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:42.025
IS PROJECTS THAT ARE DONE

00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:43.126
THROUGH THE INTEGRATED.

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:44.961
REGIONAL WATER. MANAGEMENT

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:47.163
PROGRAMS. AND THOSE ARE

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.766
PROJECTS THAT. THAT I'M WORRIED

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.668
OR NOT REALLY INCLUDED IN HERE

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:54.103
BECAUSE OF. SOME OF THE LACK OF

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.638
SPECIFICITY IN THE LANGUAGE

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:57.740
AROUND THE WATER. AND WHY I

00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:00.276
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. IS THIS

00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:03.279
IS ABOUT RESILIENCE. BUT LOCAL

00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:04.881
AGENCIES THROUGH THESE REGIONAL

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.583
PROGRAMS REGIONAL INTERESTS.

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:08.184
REGIONAL WHICH MEANS THAT

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:09.953
THEY'RE VETTED BY LOCAL

00:58:10.019 --> 00:58:11.187
AGENCIES MULTIPLE LOCAL

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:12.922
AGENCIES. THESE ARE PROJECTS TO

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.724
BENEFIT HABITAT. THE BENEFIT

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.492
WATER SUPPLY THE BENEFIT

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:18.228
FISHERIES THAT HAVE TRULY

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:21.064
MULTIPLE BENEFITS. AND WE DON'T

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.466
THINK OF THESE PROGRAMS AS PART

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:24.868
OF THE RESILIENCE. BECAUSE

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:25.635
THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:27.103
WE'VE BEEN FUNDING THEM BUT

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.172
THEY'VE BEEN DOING RESILIENCE

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:32.041
FOR A LONG TIME. SO I JUST WANT

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:35.011

BEEN ASKING FOR A WHILE AND I

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:41.818
APPRECIATE THAT- BUT I DISAGREE

00:58:41.885 --> 00:58:43.353
THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THEIR

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:44.921
NECESSARILY COVERS THESE KINDS

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:46.422
OF PROGRAMS. SO THAT IS

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.858
SOMETHING I'M ASKING IF WE CAN

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:50.059
STRENGTHEN. BECAUSE THOSE ARE

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:51.494
TRUE RESILIENCE PROGRAMS THAT

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:53.429
HAVE BEEN HUGELY SUCCESSFUL

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:55.064
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN HELD UP BY

00:58:55.131 --> 00:58:55.732
SEEK WITH IT HAVE NOT BEEN HELD

00:58:55.798 --> 00:58:58.001

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:20.356
SECTION THERE'S FORTY MILLION

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:23.359
DOLLARS- TO CDFA AS IT RELATES

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:25.728

DOLLARS WILL NOT JUST BE GOING

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.987
THROUGH A MMP CURVE MMP BUT IT

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.688
ELIGIBLE FOR DIGESTIVE AS WELL

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:54.557
CORRECT THAT'S THE WAY I

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:57.526

MONIES TO THOSE AGENCIES HAVE

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:10.606
BEEN TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. MR

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:12.341
STONE IS BROUGHT DOWN TO A

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:13.342
POINT FORWARD I THOUGHT WAS

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.778
VERY VERY- LIKE WE CANNOT

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.713
FORGET ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT

HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:20.650
PAST RIGHT NOW METHANE DIED

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:21.817
YESTERDAY. REDUCE UP TO FORTY

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:24.020

AS FAR AS METHANE PRODUCTION

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:28.090
WITHIN- CATTLE AND DAIRY. SO I

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:29.458
AM JUST VERY VERY CONCERNED

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.427
THAT IF THAT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:32.862
CLEAR. BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.630
