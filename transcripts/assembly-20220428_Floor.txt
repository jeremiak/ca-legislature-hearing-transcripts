ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE SEVENTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL AND DOLLARS RELATIVE TO CALIFORNIA HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL YOU MAY OPEN THE MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS TO PRESENT ACR ONE SEVENTY OUR ANNUAL RESOLUTION FOR HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY. NO DID HE RISE YOM HASHOAH HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY COMMEMORATES THE APPROXIMATELY SIX MILLION JEWS AND COUNTLESS OTHERS WHO WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED BY THE **** AND THEIR COLLABORATORS. YANZHOU% ALSO HONORS JEWISH RESISTANCE DURING THE HOLOCAUST IT IS OBSERVED ANNUALLY ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE WARSAW GHETTO UPRISING. IN OBSERVING YOM HASHOAH THE JEWISH CAUCUS HAS ALWAYS BEEN COMMITTED TO CENTERING THE VOICES OF SURVIVORS. THE A SECTIONAL FEW WHO THROUGH EXTRAORDINARY RESILIENCE AN INCREDIBLE LOCKED SURVIVED THE **** ATTEMPT TO EXTERMINATE THE JEWISH PEOPLE. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO AID IN THE COVERED AGING THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC OUR ABILITY TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM SURVIVORS HAS BEEN GREATLY DIMINISHED. BUT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO TELLING THEIR STORIES AND HONORING THEIR LEGACY. SO TODAY AS PART OF DEBATE ON THIS RESOLUTION MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS ARE HONORED TO SHARE THE STORIES OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS. THESE NARRATIVES ARE ABOUT PEOPLE WE KNOW AND LOVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHOSE INCREDIBLE JOURNEYS SERVE AS AN INSPIRATION. AND ENDED DURING REMINDER OF WHY ARE CAUCUS DOES THE WORK THAT WE DO. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN TODAY WITH THE STORY OF MY FRIEND IN NEED OF FRIEDMAN. I FIRST GOT TO KNOW NEED TO BECAUSE HER SON ADAM AND I STUDY TOGETHER TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY. AND LATER BECAUSE OF HER INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP IN SO MANY JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS. I NEED FAMILY WAS DEVASTATED IN THE HOLOCAUST. HER SISTER TOTAL WAS NINE WHEN SHE WAS MURDERED IN THE GAS CHAMBERS IN TREBLINKA. HER BROTHER OR NOT SHE WAS ONLY A YEAR OLD WHEN THE **** THREW HIM OUT OF A SECOND STORY WINDOW AND THEN USED HIS BODY FOR TARGET PRACTICE. HER UNCLE WAS PUT INTO A PAIR OF ICY WATER IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER AND FROZEN TO DEATH. TWO AUNTS WERE SUBJECT TO HORRIFIC MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS INCLUDING FOR STERILIZATION. HER GRANDPARENTS WERE MURDERED SO WE'RE COUNTLESS OTHER RELATIVES THAN TWO HUNDRED FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE HOLOCAUST. YEAH NEED AS PARENTS WERE ANXIOUSLY SURVIVED THE WAR BY JOINING THE PARTISANS THE JEWISH RESISTANCE FIGHTERS TO ESCAPE INTO THE FORESTS. AFTER THE WAR THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE UNITED STATES AS STATELESS REFUGEES. I NEED A WAS BORN SIX WEEKS LATER. SHE GREW UP IN A COMMUNITY OF SIX HUNDRED HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR FAMILIES. LIKE MANY IMMIGRANT FAMILIES PEOPLE WORK TWELVE HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. I NEEDED IN SPEAK ENGLISH UNTIL SHE WAS SIX YEARS OLD. BY THAT TIME SHE KNEW ALL OF THE STORIES ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER FAMILY AND TO THE JEWS OF EUROPE. SHE UNDERSTOOD THE CRIES IN THE SCREAMS THE PEERS THE NIGHT TIME SILENCE. THERE WAS NO MYSTERY AS TO WHY THE ADULTS HAD NUMBERS TATTOOED ON THEIR ARMS. INCREDIBLY THE SURVIVORS IN HER COMMUNITY WERE NOT FILLED WITH ANGER AND HATE AND THOUGHTS OF REVENGE. ON THE CONTRARY THEY WERE FILLED WITH LOVE. DEVOTED WITH ONE ANOTHER INTO THE COMMUNITY. THEY TOOK CARE OF EACH OTHER LOANED MONEY TO THOSE IN NEED AND RAISE MONEY TO SUPPORT THE STATE OF ISRAEL. ABOVE ALL ELSE THEY FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT THE CHILDREN. I NEED A LEARNED IMPORTANT LESSONS FROM THE SURVIVORS. ABOUT WHAT REALLY MATTERS IN LIFE. SHE LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY. OF CARING FOR THE VULNERABLE AND ABOUT THE NEED FOR JEWISH POWER IN JEWISH SELF DETERMINATION. THESE LESSONS INFLUENCED HER DEEPLY. SHE BECAME A SOCIAL WORKER AND ADVOCATE FOR IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES AND TODAY SERVES AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF JEWISH FAMILY AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES. ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES IN OUR STATE. LIKE SO MANY SURVIVORS AND THEIR CHILDREN IN NEED IS ALSO DEEPLY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT WE TEACH OUR NEXT GENERATION ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST AND PATTERNS OF GENOCIDE. SHE HAS REMINDED ME RESEARCH SHOWS THE HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE EDUCATION DEVELOPS EMPATHY. REDUCES DISCRIMINATION AND HATE AND INSPIRES MORAL COURAGE AND A SENSE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. EARLIER THIS YEAR WAS SUPPORT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JEWISH FAMILY AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES LAUNCH THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE EDUCATION TO HELP TEACHERS LEARN HOW DEFECTIVE WE TEACH ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST AND OTHER GENOCIDES. MEMBERS OF THE NEW STATEWIDE COLLABORATIVE NETWORK INCLUDE LEADERS FROM THE JEWISH ARMENIAN CAMBODIAN RWANDAN SUDANESE UYGUR AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THIS COLLABORATIVE WILL TEACH SEVEN HUNDRED TEACHERS AND ULTIMATELY IMPACTS SEVENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GATHER WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE OBLIGATION TO DO MORE TO BRING THE LESSONS. CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY ABOUT CURRENT GENOCIDES AND TO REDEDICATE OURSELVES TO COMBATING ANTI SEMITISM RACISM AND BIGOTRY OF ALL FORMS. IN THAT SPIRIT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON ACR ONE SEVENTY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL WE HAVE SEVERAL SPEAKERS WISHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEBATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER HEARD ME TELL THE STORY OF MY GRANDMOTHER- WHO SMUGGLED HER AND HER MOM OUT OF THE WARSAW GHETTO AS AS THE **** CAME TO POWER. THIS MORNING I SHARE A STORY OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD A SIMILAR BEGINNING TO LIFE- AND THEN HER LIFE ACTUALLY GOT MUCH MUCH WORSE. HEADY ORTON WAS BORN IN THE SMALL ROMANIAN TOWN OF. A RED TAG. WHERE SHE ENJOYED A SAFE AND COMFORTABLE CHILDHOOD. HIS FATHER SAMUEL WAS THE PRESIDENT THE LOCAL JEWISH COMMUNITY AND HAD HE HAD MANY FRIENDS FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND RELIGIONS. BUT HER IDYLLIC CHILDHOOD STARTED TO CHANGE WHEN SHE TURNED ELEVEN AND WATCHED AS HER NEIGHBORSWERE ATTACKED IN THEIR HOMES BURNED DOWN A BY AN ANTI SEMITIC MOB. THINGS SOON GOT WORSE AND SHE WAS WOKEN FROM HER SLEEP WHEN OUR OWN HOMES WINDOWS WERE SMASHED. THEIR HOUSE OF WORSHIP NO LONGER FELT SAFE. WHAT STARTED AS ISOLATED INCIDENTS SOON LED TO FORMAL POLICIES THAT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST JEWS. THE BEGIN WITH ANTI SEMITISM IN THE SCHOOLS. AND CULMINATED WITH THE ROUNDING UP OF ALL THE JEWS AND SENDING THEM TO THE GHETTO. FOR WEEKS HEADY IN OUR FAMILY WERE IMPRISONED IN THE MUDDY FOREST. WHERE DISEASE WAS RAMPANT. THE ONLY FOOD THEY WERE GIVEN WAS PORK WHICH WAS PROHIBITED BY THEIR RELIGION AND ONLY MADE AVAILABLE TO HIM YET HUMILIATE THEM. HER FATHER WAS BEATEN SO RUTHLESSLY HE COULD NOT STAND. A NON JEWISH FAMILY FRIEND OFFERED HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE. BUT SHE REFUSED TO ABANDON HER PARENTS. HEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THINGS COULD GET ANY WORSE BUT A MONTH LATER THEY DID. THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY WAS CRAMMED INTO A WINDOWLESS CATTLE CARS SO CROWDED NO ONE COULD SIT. FOR THREE DAYS THEY HAD NO FOOD NOR WATER DESPITE THE SWELTERING HEAT. WHEN HEAVY AND OTHERS HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM THEY WENT WHERE THEY STOOD. WHEN H ARRIVED IN AUSCHWITZ SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM HER FATHER AND GRANDMOTHER BOTH OF WHOM WERE IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE GAS CHAMBERS. WHEN SHE ASKED ANOTHER PRISONER ABOUT THE ASH FALLING FROM THE SKY LIKE SNOWFLAKES AND THE DARK CLOUDS OF SMOKE SHE WAS TOLD IT WAS THE REMAINS OF HER FATHER AND GRANDMOTHER. WHO HAD BEEN INCINERATED IN THE CAMP'S EVANS. HAD HE ONLY SURVIVED AUSCHWITZ BECAUSE OF HER MOTHER HELEN. WHO STARVED HERSELF SO SHE COULD GIVE HEAVY THE TINY BIT OF MORE THE BREAD AND WATERY SOUP THEY RECEIVED. WHEN THE FORCED HEADED TO MARCH BAREFOOT THROUGH THE SNOW FOR THREE DAYS WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER. GERMAN SHEPHERDS ATTACKED HEAVY IN THE OTHER PRISONERS WHILE THE GUARDS BEAT OR SHOT ANYONE WHO STUMBLED COULD NOT WALK HEAVY CARRIED HER ON HER BACK FOR MUCH OF THE DEATH MARCH. THIS WEEK MARKS THE SEVENTY SEVEN TH THERE ARE THE SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR LIBERATION. SADLY ONLY SEVEN DAYS AFTER THEY WERE FREED HEADIES MOTHER PASSED AWAY. HAVE YOU DUG A GRAVE AND BURIED HER MOTHER WITH HER OWN HANDS. AFTER THE WAR HEADY MET HOT TED ORDER. TO WHOM SHE WAS MARRIED FOR SIXTY NINE YEARS. TED WAS A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR FROM A NEARBY TOWN WHO ALSO LOST HIS PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AT AUSCHWITZ. TOGETHER THEY ESCAPED COMMUNISM AND IMMIGRATED TO CALIFORNIA WITH THEIR YOUNG DAUGHTERS. THEY STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS WHICH OVER DECADES OF HARD WORK EVENTUALLY GREW INTO ONE OF THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND HELP THEM TO FULFILL THE AMERICAN DREAM. THEY LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND ENDED EVERY FAMILY GATHERING WITH THE WORDS GOD BLESS AMERICA. THERE SIXTEEN THERE'S SIXTEENTH GREAT GRANDCHILD BORN EARLIER THIS YEAR WAS NAMED HEDY IN LOVING MEMORY OF THE FAMILY MATRIARCH. AND HERE WITH US TODAY ARE HAITI'S GRANDSON IT BRIAN BURKE AT AND GREAT GRANDSON JACK BURKE AT A WHO I HAD THE PLEASURE OF CHATTING WITH YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND THANK HAS BECOME KIND OF THE FAMILY HISTORIAN AND JACK IS CELEBRATING HIS ELEVENTH. BIRTHDAY WITH US TODAY STORY WITH US SO THAT WE COULD SHARE IT WITH ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU MR BERMAN MISS FRIEDMAN YOUR RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS IT'S VERY EASY YEAR AFTER YEAR WHEN WE COMMEMORATE THE LIVES LOST IN THE HOLOCAUST TO START TO FEEL THAT THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO LIVED A VERY LONG TIME AWAY AGO IN A PLACE THAT MUST BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHERE WE LIVE NOW. BUT ACTION. THESE HAVE HAPPENED IN THE TIME OF OUR PARENTS AND OUR GRANDPARENTS- MOST OF US HAVE HAD INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO BORE THE SCARS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN GERMANY. AND GERMANY AT THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED TO BE. NOT JUST A CIVILIZED BUT AN ENLIGHTENED COMMUNITY A DEMOCRACY. AND YET THEY SLID INTO. ONE OF THE WORST PERIODS AND WORST ATROCITIES THAT MANKIND HAS EVER SEEN NOT JUST THE MURDER OF PEOPLE BUT THE SYSTEMATIC FACTORY LIKE. PLANNED EXECUTION OF MILLIONS OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN. IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE TELL SURVIVORS STORIES NOT JUST WHILE THEY'RE STILL WITH US AND THEY ARE STILL WITH US AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE FOR YEARS TO COME BUT SO THAT PEOPLE REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AND ALWAYS REMEMBER. THAT WE ARE JUST AS CIVILIZED AND WE ARE JUST AS ENLIGHTENED. AND THAT WITHOUT BEING DELIBERATE AND INTENTIONAL. WE ALSO COULD ALWAYS SLIDE INTO SOME SORT OF. ATROCITY ACTUATION WHERE WE ARE SO WILLING TO DEMONISE OTHER PEOPLE AND HATE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE ALLOW THE UNTHINKABLE TO HAPPEN MAYBE NOT ON A GRAND SCALE BUT EVEN ON A SMALL SCALE AND WE CAN'T ALLOW. THAT TO HAPPEN. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT A **** REALLY IS WHAT THE HOLOCAUST REALLY WAS. I MYSELF WAS CALLED A **** BY PEOPLE AND BULLHORNS JUST THIS YEAR OUTSID THE CAPITAL. WHO THOUGHT THAT ASKING PEOPLE TO WEAR A MASK OR GET VACCINATED WAS THE SAME AS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOLOCAUST AND WE HAVE TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT THAT ALSO IS INEXCUSABLE. NOW WHEN I GRADUATED COLLEGE I WAS OFFERED A JOB FROM A FRIEND OF A FRIEND. AND IT WAS MY FIRST REAL JOB AFTER COLLEGE YOU KNOW WHICH IS IN SOME WAYS YOUR MOST IMPORTANT JOB. THAT FIRST ONE THAT SETS YOU ON YOUR CAREER PATH. AND I WENT TO WORK FOR A LOVELY MAN WHO WAS A FILM PRODUCER IN NEW YORK CITY. AND HE WAS BRIGHTS AND HE WAS FINE AND HE WAS A GREAT BOSS AND WE ARE TO THIS DAY STILL CLOSE FRIENDS IN FACT THEY WERE JUST AT MY HOUSE A FEW WEEKS AGO HE IS ALSO A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR MY FRIEND BENNY CORSON WAS BORN IN DENMARK IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT. GERMANY INVADED DENMARK APRIL NINETEEN FORTY UNTIL AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY THREE LIKE DENMARK UNFOLDED AS THE WORLD WAR TWO WAS HAPPENING SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT IT WASN'T ALL THAT CHANGED IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE OUT OF AIKMAN CENTER NEXT TO THE GERMAN EMBASSY COPENHAGEN ORDERING THE GESTAPO TO ROUND UP ALL OF THE DANISH JEWS ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE. WORD GOT OUT SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE MANAGE TO GO INTO HIDING HOPING TO MAKE IT TO SAFETY IN SWEDEN FOUR HUNDRED WERE UNFORTUNATELY CAPTURED AND SENT TO THE CAMPS AND THE CHAOS OF GOING INTO HIDING BENNY'S PARENTS DECIDED TO LEAVE HIM WITH A GENTILE FAMILY ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF COPENHAGEN. ON A DAK NIGHT IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN FORTY THREE HE WAS BROUGHT TO A SMALL BOAT THAT CROSSED THE WATER BETWEEN DENMARK AND SWEDEN WHICH BROUGHT BENNY AND SIX ADULTS TO SWEDEN WHERE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN WAITING NERVOUSLY. FOR SEVERAL DAYS. IN NINETEEN SIXTY MANY WORKED AS A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT AT A SMALL FILM PRODUCTION COMPANY IN COPENHAGEN. AND A CREW FROM CBS AT FROM NEW YORK ARRIVED TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE IN DENMARK. BENNY IN THE PRODUCTION COMPANY INTERVIEWED MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE DANISH RESISTANCE MOVEMENT.% INCLUDING THE VERY MAN ON HIS BOAT. HE WAS TAKEN TO SWEDEN. THAT MAN SAID TO BENNY. WE DON'T KNOW ANY JEWS ALL I AND MY GROUP KNEW WAS THAT THEY WERE DANES WHO NEEDED HELP. HE AND HIS GROUP CROSSED THE TURBULENT SOUND BETWEEN DENMARK AND SWEDEN A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO TIMES UNTIL THAT MAN WAS CAPTURED BY THE GERMANS IN MARCH OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR. HE WAS SENT TO A CAMP UNTIL THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO WERE HUMOR ACCURATELY SURVIVED. IF ONLY ALL CITIZENS OF ALL COUNTRIES LOOKED AT THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN FELLOW CITIZENS AND SAID THEY ARE MY BROTHERS THEY ARE MY SISTERS AND I WILL PROTECT THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN MISTER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER OUR HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE TODAY RECOGNIZES THAT OUR BELOVED AND RESPECTED COMMUNITY OF SURVIVORS IS SHRINKING EVERY YEAR. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION WHO WILL BEAR WITNESS TO SIX MILLION SOULS LOST TO THE HEROES TO THE STORIES OF THE TRAUMA. WHO IT MUST BE US AND SO I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M GRATEFUL FOR MY COLLEAGUESAND TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE SHARING STORIES AND LISTENING TO STORIES TODAY AND I WANT TO BRIEFLY SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW MY OWN FAMILY WAS AFFECTED BY THE HOLOCAUST AND- IT'S NOT A TYPICAL STORY BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE IS A TYPICAL STORY AND I THINK. AS YOU LISTEN. TO THE STORIES TODAY THAT'S ONE OF THE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED IS THAT- EVERY STORY IS AN INDIVIDUAL STORY EVERY FAMILY WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT- BOUND TOGETHER BY THESE. HORRIFIC EVENTS. MY MOM AND DAD WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE BORN IN THE UNITED STATES DUE TO THE FACT THAT BOTH MY MATERNAL. AND PATERNAL GRANDPARENTS MADE- VERY PRESCIENT DECISION AND EMIGRATED FROM EASTERN EUROPE NOT FAR FROM FROM KEY FIVE BY THE WAY- IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS TO ESCAPE AN EARLIER PERIOD OF OPPRESSION AND ANTI SEMITISM AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER. THAT HISTORICALLY HOLOCAUST CAME FROM SOMEWHERE ALL OF THAT HATE DIDN'T JUST SHOW UP IN AN INSTANT IT HAD BEEN. GROPPER AND GROWING LITERALLY FOR CENTURIES. BUT MY GRANDPARENTS MADE THE RIGHT DECISION BECAUSE THOSE RELATIVES WHO STAYED BEHIND WERE LITERALLY WIPED OUT ALONG WITH MANY VILLAGES AND TOWNS DURING THE COURSE OF THE HOLOCAUST I REMEMBER MY MOM COMING BACK FROM A TRIP TO YAD VASHEM MANY OF YOU HAVE TRAVELED TO JERUSALEM AND HAVE HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING AT YAD VASHEM THE- MEMORIAL TO THE HOLOCAUST- BUT IT IS ALSO A PLACE WHERE RECORDS ARE CAPPED AND MY MOM. AB ONE AT THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SEVENTIES NOW MY MOM WANTED TO SEE IF SHE COULD FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN MANY OF HER RELATIVES. I'VE AND UNFORTUNATELY SHE WAS UNABLE TO FIGHT SHE HAD NAMES- AND SHE WAS UNABLE TO FIND RECORDS ON ANY OF THEM. AN ENTIRE BRANCH OF OUR FAMILY HAD BEEN LOST ALMOST WITHOUT A TRACE. MANY OF YOU HAVE MET MY WIFE ROBBIE BLACK IN HER FAMILY STORY IS VERY DIFFERENT. ROBBIE'S FATHER FRANK BLACK WAS BORN FRANZ FAR CHILLED IN NINETEEN TWENTY IN FRANKFORT GERMANY. FRANK WAS THE YUNGEST SON OF AN EXTREMELY WEALTHY FAMILY THAT TRACED ITS ROOTS BACK NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED YEARS THE SPANISH INQUISITION YET ANOTHER PERIOD OF TIME OF OPPRESSION AGAINST JEWS. BUT HE GREW UP FRANK GREW UP IN A MANSION IN FRANKFORT IN ITS FINEST NEIGHBORHOOD. AND HE PLAYED IN THE CITY'S MOST BEAUTIFUL PARKS AND PROBABLY RUBBED ELBOWS WITH THE YOUNG AND FRANK WHO WAS ALSO FROM FRANKFORT. FRANK'S FATHER EDUARD LARGE SHIELD WAS A WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN A SILK MERCHANT OPERATING FROM ONE OF FRANKFURT'S MOST NOTABLE BUILDINGS THAT STILL STANDS TODAY. AND HE WAS A DIPLOMAT HE WAS APPOINTED THE HONORARY CONSUL TO ESTONIA. BUT AS THE SITUATION BEGAN TO DETERIORATE DETERIORATES AND PROGRAM. IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX THE FAMILY WAS FORCED TO SELL THEIR HOME FOR A PITTANCE AND HAD TO MOVE. EVENTUALLY A DECISION WAS MADE THAT FRANK HIS SISTER HIS BROTHER ONE OF HIS BROTHERS- AND HIS MOTHER WOULD LEAVE GERMANY AND COME TO THE U. S. THEY SUCCESSFULLY DID SO IN THE EARLY NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT BUT THEY WOULD NEVER SEE THE REST OF THEIR FAMILY AGAIN. EDUARD CLINGING AS MANY DID TO THE FALSE HOPE THAT THINGS WOULD GET BETTER. REFUSED TO LEAVE. AND FRANK'S BROTHER OLDER BROTHER MAXIMILIAN. TOOK A DIFFERENT PATH AND JOIN THE UNDERGROUND DETERMINED TO FIGHT THE **** IN NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT. THE EVENT KNOWN AS KRISTALLNACHT THE NIGHT OF BROKEN GLASS HAPPENED. JEWISH OWNED BUSINESSES AND SYNAGOGUES ACROSS GERMANY WERE ATTACKED DEFACED AND TORCHED. THE BEAUTIFUL FRANKFORT SYNAGOGUE WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING FOR SHARK SHIELD OX THE FAMILY BUSINESS WAS DESTROYED THAT NIGHT. BY THIS TIME EDWARD AND LOST EVERYTHING WITH NOWHERE TO TURN AND FACING A LIKELY ARREST BY THE **** JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER KRISTALLNACHT. EDWARD INITIAL FOR AND BEST FRIEND A MAN NAMED DOSHMAN TOOK THEIR LIVES IN JANUARY OF NINETEEN THIRTY NINE. MEANWHILE ROBBIE'S UNCLE FRANK'S OLDER BROTHER MAXIMILIAN HEROICALLY JOINED THE RESISTANCE. AND THIS WAS IN FRANCE HE HAD TRAVELED TO FRANCE. UNCLE MAX MUST'VE BEEN A GREAT ACCESS ASSET TO THE RESISTANCE BECAUSE HE SPOKE GERMAN FRENCH AND ENGLISH FLUENTLY. AND I SUSPECT HE MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE FAMOUS EVACUATION OF DUNKIRK BECAUSE IT COINCIDED WITH THAT TIME. WHILE HE WAS IN THE RESISTANCE. THAT WAS A STRATEGIC HISTORIC AND ROGUE RETREAT AND IF YOU KNOW THE STORY OF DUNKIRK A LOT OF THE INTELLIGENCE THAT LED TO THE SUCCESSFUL RETREAT HAPPEN BEHIND ENEMY LINES. ACTUAL RECORDS BECAUSE THE **** WERE REALLY GOOD RECORD KEEPERS. RECORDS SHOW THAT MAXIMILIAN WAS CAPTURED IN FRANCE IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE. HE WAS DEPORTED BY RAIL CAR THE DEATH CAMP AT AUSCHWITZ WHERE HE PERISHED. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BEAR WITNESS MY FAMILY'S HOLOCAUST. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM MISTER LIVIGNO RECOGNIZED SPEAKER THANK YOU MEMBERS AYE I'M SO GRATEFUL TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SEVENTY IN THAT ALL OF YOU JOIN IN THIS REMEMBRANCE OF YAMAHA SHOW- OF THE HOLOCAUST EACH YEAR AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR ALL OF SOCIETY- WE REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST WE REMEMBER THE EVIL- THE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY PERPETRATED AGAINST THE JEWS- AND THAT. IS NOT BEHIND US IN HISTORY I SHARED WITH YOU A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ABOUT HOW ON MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER'S NATURALIZATION PAPERS IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES IT DESCRIBES HER RACE AS HEBREW THEY EVEN THOUGH AS SHE BECAME AN AMERICAN SHE WAS OTHER. LIKE SO MANY OTHERS ARE OTHER WEATHER HERE IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY BUT THAT DIDN'T JUST STOP WHEN THE HOLOCAUST ENDED. WE KNOW THAT JEWS ARE OTHER HARPER ARE PERSECUTED- THAT THIS ANTI SEMITISM IS STILL ALIVE- WHEN WE SEE VLADIMIR PUTIN USING IN. THE HISTORY AND THE MEMORY OF THE OWN COMMUNITY IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHERE PAMPHLETS AND LEAFLETS ARE DROPPED. WITH THE **** SWASTIKA AND TALK OF KOBE BEING A JEWISH CONSPIRACY. THAT WE ARE TREATED AS OTHERS. JEWS ARE. AND THAT- THAT THIS ISN'T AS MY COLLEAGUE HAD MENTIONED EARLIER. THE HOLOCAUST DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALWAYS THERE THIS HATRED AGAINST JEWS AND SO WHEN WE WROTE REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST IT IS TO PROTECT ALL OF US FROM THIS DESTRUCTIVE DISEASE OF ANTI SEMITISM WE HAVE A WONDERFUL TRADITION IT'S VERY HARD IT'S VERY CHALLENGING FOR US TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE. OF HONORING HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS AND MANY OF THE WOMEN AND MEN WHO I HAVE BROUGHT UP TO HONOR HAVE PASSED AWAY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS- INCLUDING THE MOTHER OF MY FRIEND BRUCE RIFLE I MANY OF YOU KNOW MY FRIEND GROUP IS AMAZING FRIEND A TRUE ALTRUIST- AND MENSCH- AND I HONORED BOTH HIS FATHER BOB RAE FULL. WHO WAS A LIBERATOR- OF THE CAMPUS AS A MEMBER OF THE U. S. ARMY- AND I'VE HONORED HIS MOTHER SUSIE WHO IS A SURVIVOR OF THE HOLOCAUST I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SUSIE. AS I DID A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS MY GUEST FOR ON THE FLOOR AND I WISH THAT YOU COULD BE HERE TODAY- SUSIE WAS BORN PASSED HUNGRY SHED TO PARENTS SHE HAD TWO SISTERS- THEY WERE TAKEN TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS IS HE WAS IN TEARS AND STOP. AND SHE- DURING THE WINTER OF NINETEEN FIVE. WAS FORCED TO WALK WITHOUT SHOES OR FOOD IN THE DEATH MARCH FROM THE SWATOW LABOR CAMP TO DACHAU DEATH CAMP. AND OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED WOMEN. THAT BEGAN DOT MARCH SHE WAS ONE OF ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY- SURVIVED AND I'M SO THANKFUL THAT SHE DID. ON JULY SEVENTH NINETEEN FORTY FIVE SHE MET THAT WORLD WAR TWO LIBERATOR BOB GRATEFUL- WHILE SHE WAS REHABILITATING AND RECOVERING FROM THE HOLOCAUST THEY MET ONLY BRIEFLY. BEFORE BOB WAS SHIPPED HOME BUT THEY CORRESPONDED FOR TWO YEARS- THEY WEREN'T SENDING EMAILS FOR FACE TIME. THEY THEY THEY THEY WROTE LETTERS AND- SHE CAME TO NEW YORK AND THEY MARRIED AND THEY HAD TWO CHILDREN AND DIED AND NOW. THEY HAVE FIVE GRANDCHILDREN AND TWO GREAT GRANDCHILDREN THREE GREAT GRANDCHILDREN NOW- IT'S AMAZING LOVE STORY- I WISH THAT THERE WERE MORE OF THOSE LOVE STORIES- BUT PAID WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE EVERYBODY. FROM THE HOLOCAUST BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TODAY TO REMEMBER THEM AND TO REMEMBER WHY WE MUST STAND UP AGAINST ANTI SEMITISM. AND TO AND TO RECOGNIZE THE STAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR LEVINE MISTER WARD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE C. R.

THE HOME WAS ALWAYS FILLED WITH LOTS OF FOOD AND LOTS OF LOVE. THEY HAD A WORKING FARM THEIR FATHER RENT AND DRY GOOD STORE OUT OF THE FAMILY'S HOME. THEY WERE IN OBSERVING HOUSEHOLD AND LIFE CENTERED AROUND THE CADENCE OF JEWISH HOLIDAYS AND FAMILY. GET EXPLAINED I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HE CAME OUT OF ITS UGLY HEAD. MY FIRST INTRODUCTION WAS WHEN A JEWISH MAN WALKING BACK FROM TEMPLE AND I STILL REMEMBER HIS NAME M. MINKUS WAS WALKING BY. A LITTLE GIRL MY NEIGHBOR SAID ZADEHIN POLISH WHICH MEANS TO. AND WITHOUT THE BLINK OF AN EYE ADJOURNMENTS OLDER SOLDIER PULLED OUT A REVOLVER AND SHOT HIM DEAD THAT WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO THE **** NOT LONG AFTER. THE **** ARMED LOCAL POLISH COLLABORATORS WITH GUNS AND TRUCKS AND GIVEN THE BOUNTY TO MURDER AS MANY JEWS AS POSSIBLE. THESE PEOPLE WHO HAD LIVED PEACEFULLY WITH THEIR JEWISH NEIGHBORS INVITED THE JEWISH LEADERS TO A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE **** SITUATION AND HOW THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS IT. INSTEAD OF A TOWN HALL THE JEWS WERE FORCED AT GUNPOINT TO DIG MASS GRAVES. OVER SIXTY OF MANTLE'S CHIPS LEADERS WERE MURDERED THAT NIGHT AMONG THEM. WHEN HE RECEIVED THE INVITATION TO THE MEETING. HE TOLD HIS FAMILY THAT SOMETHING SEEMED OFF. AND HE HAD TO GO HIDE IN THE WOODS. THE FAMILY FLED WITH NOTHING BUT THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK. THEY HEADED EAST AND JAPAN THE JEWISH RESISTANCE. AND AS A CHILD OF EIGHT GET A BRAVELY COMPLETED NUMEROUS MISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH RESISTANCE. THEIR FAMILY SURVIVED IN THE WOODS FOR TWO YEARS. MAKING THEIR WAY EAST AND NARROWLY ESCAPING THE **** GRASS. THE ENTERED FREEZING CONDITIONS AND PERSISTENT HUNGER. EVENTUALLY THE FAMILY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE RUSSIAN FRONT AND SURVIVED THE WAR IN A WORK CAMP IN SIBERIA. AFTER THE WAR YEAH THIS FAMILY MOVED HERE TO LOS ANGELES. SHE MARRIED DAVID KEENE.

OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BARRICADED CAN'T BE WITH US TODAY WHOSE GRANDMOTHER WAS A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR. BUT YOU HEARD ABOUT MR BERMAN FAMILY HEARD ABOUT MR BLOOM'S FAMILY. YOU HEARD ABOUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN'S EXPERIENCES WITH ALL OF THIS. FOR ALL OF US THIS IS THIS IS A DEEPLY PERSONAL ISSUE. AND THE HOLOCAUST WAS MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUAL TRAUMAS. BUT IT WAS ALSO A COLLECTIVE TRAUMA. THERE'S A COLLECTIVE TRAUMA THAT WE AS THE JEWISH COMMUNITY FEEL. AND IT IS SO POWERFULLY INFLUENCE THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE WORLD. THE WAY THAT WE REACT TO ISSUES THE WAY THAT WE AS A CAUCUS NAVIGATE THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE ISSUES THAT WE WORK ON AND IT'S SO FUNDAMENTALLY MOTIVATES THE WORK THAT WE DO NOT ONLY TO STAND UP FOR OURSELVES. AND OUR COMMUNITY UNFLINCHINGLY BUT ALSO THE WORK AND THE MISSION THAT WE FEEL TO STAND UP FOR OTHER VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO STAND UP AGAINST OTHER INSTANCES OF GENOCIDE IN THE WORLD SO STAND WITH OTHER VULNERABLE COMMITTEES WHETHER THEY ARE. OR ARE DEGENERATES OR OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING PERSECUTION.
