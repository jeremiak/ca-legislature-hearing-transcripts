THAT SAYS THAT. THAT THEY NEED

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.230
TO. MAKE A CAR SEAT MORE STRAIN

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:06.798
RESISTANT THERE'S FOR CLOTHING

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:08.233
AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.668
CERTAINLY OTHER MATERIALS THAT

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:11.169
ARE USED BY A LOT OF INCOME

00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:12.771
COMPANIES IF YOU BUY ORGANIC

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:13.872
MATERIALS A LOT OF TIMES THEY

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.774
HAVE OTHER TYPES OF. YOU KNOW

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.876
THINGS ON THEM THAT WOULD HELP

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.011
MAKE IT A LITTLE SLICKER WHEN

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:21.079
YOU WASH IT SO UNLIKE WITH

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:22.114
FLAME RETARDANTS WHICH AT ONE

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.615
POINT WHERE I THINK WERE

00:21:23.682 --> 00:21:25.417
MANDATED BY LAW. NONE OF THIS

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:28.053
IS IMPACTED BY ANY REGULATIONS

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.287
AND WE'VE EXEMPTED THINGS THAT

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:31.023
WE THINK THERE IS AN ARGUMENT

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.157
FOR SOME OF THE ELECTRONICS FOR

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.692
INSTANCE AND- THINGS THAT ARE

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:36.094
INSIDE- INSIDE THESE PRODUCTS

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:38.130
SO. IF THAT YOUR QUESTION IF

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:39.197
YOUR QUESTION IS WHETHER

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:40.532
THEY'RE USING IT BECAUSE OF ANY

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:43.902
LAW THAT REQUIRES THEM TO THE

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:48.206
ANSWER IS NO. SO- SO THIS BILL

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:51.343
BASICALLY IS DEFINING DOES IF

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.612
IT WANTS TO WE ARE PROP SIXTY

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:55.113
FIVE WHICH LATE THAT'S A

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.015
LABELING ISSUE AND LETTING THE

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:59.685
CONSUMERS KNOW WHAT THE RISK IS

00:21:59.751 --> 00:22:00.886
OF USING THE PRODUCTS SO THAT

00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:02.854
DOES NOT THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:03.822
TOUCH THAT IS STILL GOING TO BE

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:07.826
LABELED- THIS BILL BASICALLY IS

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:11.329
NEARING IN ON THOSE- VERY.

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:14.032

THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT BODY

00:23:26.138 --> 00:23:27.906
SCIENCE TO IT. I THINK THAT'S

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:28.907
REFLECTED IN SOME OF THE

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:31.109
OPPOSITION THAT HAVE SAID OKAY

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:32.878

SOME. BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:50.629

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:53.665
INTENTIONAL- N. IF I IF I COULD

THAT THAT'S COULD LAND. ON IT'S

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:02.574
NOT. IT'S IT IS IT THE

00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:04.176
NATURALLY OCCURRING INTENTION.

00:24:04.242 --> 00:24:06.077
OR IS IT THAT THAT'S ADDED TO

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:08.880
THE PRODUCTS- FOR THESE

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.582
JUVENILE PRODUCTS. YEAH I WELL

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:11.950
WE HAVE TAKEN- THE LANGUAGE

00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:13.185
THAT WE TOOK FROM THE COMMITTEE

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:15.720
WAS TO GIVE MORE CERTAINTY TO

00:24:15.787 --> 00:24:16.988
THAT MANUFACTURERS IN THAT

00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:19.858
REGARD. SO THAT THEY FELT THAT

00:24:19.925 --> 00:24:21.393
THEY WOULDN'T BE- SORT OF. THEY

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:22.460
WOULD NEVER PUNITIVE ACTION

00:24:22.527 --> 00:24:23.862
AGAINST THEM WHEN THEY DID NOT

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:25.096
KNOW THAT THERE WAS PEOPLE ALSO

00:24:25.163 --> 00:24:26.598
WAS NATURALLY OCCURRING. OR

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:27.399
THERE WAS OTHER KIND OF

00:24:27.465 --> 00:24:29.401
CONTAMINATION. SO WE'RE HOPEFUL

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:30.435
THAT THAT WILL REMOVE THEIR

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:31.603
OPPOSITION AS YOU HER I DON'T

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.604

CAME IN AS THEY WERE SPEAKING.

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:35.407
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE TO GO BACK

00:24:35.473 --> 00:24:37.442
TO THEIR MEMBERS TO. MAKE SURE

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:38.977
THAT ALL OF THEIR ISSUES ARE

00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:40.212
ADDRESSED AND YOU KNOW WE WANT

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:41.680
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:43.548
WORKABLE FOR INDUSTRY AS WELL-

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:46.017
THE SO- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:46.885
THEY'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:48.253
LIABILITY WHEN THEY IF THEY

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.454
MAKE ALL THE BEST EFFORTS TO

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:50.422
MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THIS

00:24:50.488 --> 00:24:52.924
MATERIAL IS NOT THERE. AND IT

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:54.192
COMES FROM THE INSIDE OF THE

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:55.694
PRODUCT OR SOMETHING HAPPENS

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.261
THAT THEY'LL HAVE A CHANCE T

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:57.929
CORRECT THAT. AND IT'S

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:58.663
CONSISTENT WITH THE LARA

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.266
LANGUAGE THAT DAY THAT WE HAD

00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:02.267
CORRECT IN YOUR SYSTEM THAT

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:04.369
LIKE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. THEY

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:05.270
UNDERSTAND THEY KNOW HOW TO

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.305

THAT THEY HAD AND I WOULD LIKE

00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:13.745
TO THIS POINT OUT THAT THEIR

OPPOSITION WAS NOT ABOUT THE

00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:16.648
INTENT OF THIS BILL. I WILL

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:17.849
GIVE INDUSTRY A LOT OF CREDIT

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:19.217
FOR SAYING HEY WE GET THAT THIS

SEE THIS ANYMORE EITHER WE

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.855
UNDERSTAND THE EMERGING. DATA

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:25.423
SCIENCE ABOUT THE RISKS OF THIS

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.491

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:16.240
DETERMINE- SO WHAT'S THE

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.341
DEFINITION OF A BEACH WHAT'S

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:18.676
THE DEPOSITION OF THIS OF

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.411
COURSE SO I GUESS FOR ME IT'S

00:41:20.477 --> 00:41:21.245
LIKE. WHO'S GOING TO DO WHAT

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.980
AND- HOW THE PROCESS GOING TO

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:25.482
GO FORWARD. WELL UNDER THE BILL

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:27.718
THE WATER BOARD IS SET- CHARGED

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:29.553
WITH SETTING UP THAT PROCESS

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.921
AND CARRYING IT THROUGH AND WE

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:33.791
PROVIDE. SOME GUIDANCE AND TIME

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:37.061
LIMITS- TO GET WITHIN WHICH

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:39.063
THAT WORK IS TO BE DONE. I

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:40.831
THINK FOR MORE DETAIL PROBABLY-

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:42.766
A DOCTOR PIZZA AT HEAL THE BAY

00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:45.102
MAY BE ABLE TO ADD SOME

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:51.041
ADDITIONAL DETAIL. SURE I CAN

00:41:51.108 --> 00:41:53.711
ADD TO THAT THANK YOU. SO IN

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:54.778
TERMS OF THE ATTENDING THE

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:56.680
DEFINITION I THINK THERE IS

00:41:56.747 --> 00:41:58.883
SOME SUGGESTION AND SOME

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.351
SUGGESTIONS AND THE BILL

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.253
LANGUAGE WHERE INDIFFERENT

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:03.654
CRITERIA COULD BE TAKEN INTO

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:06.090
ACCOUNT TO- SET FORTH WHAT

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.591
WOULD BE A PRIORITY RECREATION

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:09.260
PLIGHT THE CLEARLY IT WE

00:42:09.326 --> 00:42:10.794
WOULDN'T EXPECT MONITORING TO

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.196
HAPPEN AT. YOU KNOW EVERY

00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:14.665
SINGLE SITE ON THE RIVER WHERE

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:16.267
THERE'S ANY SORT OF RECREATION

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:17.968
BUT WE WOULD TRY TO PRIORITIZE

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:20.905
THOSE AREAS THAT WOULD BE BASED

00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:22.506
ON THINGS LIKE. HOW USE THEY

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:23.974
GET WHETHER THEY'RE IS I THANK

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:26.176
WATER CALL CONCERNS. WHETHER

00:42:26.243 --> 00:42:27.912
THERE IS A LOCATION THAT ARE

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:29.713
USED FOR A COMMERCIAL.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.916
ENDEAVORS LIKE. RAFTING OR

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:33.450
OTHER KINDS OF THINGS LIKE THAT

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:34.451
AS WELL AS THE IT BY

00:42:34.518 --> 00:42:36.387
OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES SO.

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:38.489
THAT THE IN THE CALIFORNIA

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:39.490
WATER QUALITY MONITORING

00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:41.258
COUNCIL WOULD SET UP A WORK

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:42.459
GROUP THAT WOULD WORK THROUGH

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:43.827
THOSE ISSUES IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:45.162
WOULD BE THE CRITERIA THAT

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:49.733
WOULD QUALIFY. RIGHT TO. I'VE

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.401
ACTUALLY BE MONITORED. THAT

00:42:50.467 --> 00:42:53.404
WOULD BE SAFE TO SAY. A LONG

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.738
MOST OF THESE TRIBUTARIES THERE

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.707
RT THERE'S A LOT OF MONITORING

00:42:56.774 --> 00:42:59.410
GOING ON ALREADY FOR THE OXYGEN

00:42:59.476 --> 00:43:02.980
AND- FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:04.048
DROPPING OUT OF THE SO WITH

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:05.749
THAT INFORMATION IS ALREADY

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:08.886
AVAILABLE STE BE USED TO

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:10.854
DETERMINE WHETHER YOU. NEED

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:14.758
EVEN GOING FURTHER. WHAT I'M

00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:15.559
LOOKING FOR THAT ONE ANOTHER

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:17.194
LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY ON TOP OF

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.796
WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE. A LOT OF

00:43:18.862 --> 00:43:20.698
MONITORING GOING ON IT MOST OF

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:22.232
THE STREAMS AND RIVERS IN MY

00:43:22.299 --> 00:43:24.635
DISTRICT HAVE. A MUNICIPALITIES

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:25.536
THAT ARE PULLING OUT OF THOSE

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.404
OR PUTTING STUFF BACK IN AND

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:28.138
THEN WE HAVE MONITORING THAT'S

00:43:28.205 --> 00:43:30.107
IT ALREADY AVAILABLE THAT WE

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.776
WOULD NOT REQUIRE A NOTHER. AND

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:34.411
THEN THERE'S RECREATION ALONG

00:43:34.478 --> 00:43:35.746
THOSE TRIBUTARIES THAT WE WOULD

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:36.914
NOT REQUIRE THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:37.982
SUFFICIENT IF THEY USE THE

00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:39.516
MONITORING THE PROBLEM THOSE

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:41.752
MINUTES APOLOGIES. THE BILL

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:42.786
ACTUALLY KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THAT

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:45.823
IS- HI IN FACT THE CASE-

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:47.825
HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT OTHER

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:49.426
MONITORING CUT THAT'S GOING ON

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:50.961
IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:53.230
STANDARDS SO ONE OF THE EFFORTS

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:56.066
HERE SHOULD BE TO- I HAVE A

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.735
CONSISTENT SET OF STANDARDS SO

00:43:57.801 --> 00:44:00.437
THAT ONE GOES FROM ONE. AREA TO

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:02.773
THE NEXT- YOUR- YOU'RE GETTING

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.276
A REPORT THAT HAS SOME

00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:10.014
CONSISTENCY. TO IT. HI AND- SO

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.415
I THINK THAT'S AT LEAST

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.716
PARTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO YOUR

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:16.720
TO YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU.

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.922
SENATE BATES A YEAR FOR THANK

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:19.990
YOU I THINK CONSERVE

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:21.625
CONCEPTUALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:23.494
BILLION I IT'S REALLY A GOOD

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.562
IDEA I THINK IMPRACTICALITY

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:27.698
HOWEVER I'M JUST FOLLOWING UP

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:29.400
ON MY COLLEAGUES FROM BEAVER

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.168
ARE WHO MENTIONED- YOU KNOW HOW

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:33.737
MANY TRIBUTARIES AND RIVERS AND

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:35.039
ALL THAT IT'S A KIND OF A

00:44:35.105 --> 00:44:36.807
MASSIVE UNDERTAKING AND SOME OF

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:38.609
THE MORE ON NOT ENOUGH AREAS

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:40.377
WHERE WE HAVE THOSE STREAMS AND

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.312
LAKES ALONG THE BEACH AREAS I

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:43.881
WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THE

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:45.215
MONITORING CONFIRMED THERE WAS

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:47.184
A LOT OF POLLUTION HERE IN

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:48.786
SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY BEACHES AND

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:49.887
IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS THE

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:51.288
BIRDS THAT WERE. THE REAL

00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:54.024
PROBLEM SO I GO TO THE QUESTION

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:55.993
OF A WIN THE SOURCES DISCOVERED

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.394
AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT

00:44:57.461 --> 00:44:59.229
OF POLLUTION GOING ON WITH THE

00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:01.131
ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWING UP IN

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.966
THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR STATE

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:03.901
I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:06.070
IMPORTANT THAT ON THIS BOARD

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:07.838
THAT WILL BE BROUGHT TOGETHER-

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:09.106
THAT WE DO HAVE LOCAL

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:10.741
GOVERNMENTS I INVOLVED IN

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:12.376
THOSE- AS MENTIONED BY MY

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:14.945
COLLEAGUE THE- OF THE- TESTING

00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:16.547
THAT'S ALREADY GOING ON FOR YOU

00:45:16.613 --> 00:45:18.549
KNOW OTHER OTHER PURPOSES ALL

00:45:18.615 --> 00:45:19.550
OF THOSE PEOPLE NEED TO BE AT

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:21.385
THE TABLE. AND I WOULD ALSO

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:22.786
SUGGEST AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT

00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:24.388
IT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:26.557
VERY IMPORTANT STEP BUT I THINK

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:28.192
OF THE WORD MANNER IN WHICH IS

00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:30.027
PUT TOGETHER IS PROBABLY THE

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:31.495
MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:34.498
THIS BEING WORKABLE DATA SOURCE

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:35.799
IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE ALL

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.668
COSTS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE

00:45:37.734 --> 00:45:40.204
AND THOSE ARE ALREADY LAYERED-

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:42.306
IN A NUMBER OF AREAS BUT WHEN

00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:44.208
YOU DETERMINE THE SOURCE IN THE

00:45:44.274 --> 00:45:45.509
PROGRAM OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:46.910
BE CONTROLLED I DO BELIEVE THE

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:48.112
PLAN NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT BACK

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:49.847
THE LEGISLATURE. AND I'D LIKE

00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:51.281
TO HAVE SOME COMMITMENT THAT

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:52.616
THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:53.917
BECAUSE THEY CAN COME UP WITH A

00:45:53.984 --> 00:45:56.286
PLAN THAT SOUNDS GREAT BUT WHEN

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:56.920
IT'S IMPOSED ON LOCAL

00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:58.489
GOVERNMENTS THEY'RE ALREADY

00:45:58.555 --> 00:46:00.190
DOING SOME OF THESE THINGS AND

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:03.727
THE MYRIAD OF SOURCE POTENTIAL

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:04.695
FOR THE POLLUTION OF WHATEVER

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:09.466
RADIOS CAN BE- HUGE HUGE ARE IT

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:11.435
TOOK FOR THE BEACH AREAS I WAS

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:13.504
ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:18.375
EIGHT YEARS IT TOOK ALMOST.

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:19.543
THAT ENTIRE TIME TO TESTING OUR

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.277
TO DETERMINE THAT IT WAS. OF

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:21.612
THE BIRD IN THE SIZE FOR THEM

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:23.514
FOR OF THE CAMPUS- BEECHER.

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.815
THAT WE REALLY SOURCE AND IT

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:27.251
WASN'T JUST THE ODD. OUTFLOW

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:29.686
FROM FERTILIZING LAWNS UP UP

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:31.655
AND NOT HIGHLANDS OF. THE FACT

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:33.423
MANY OF SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.225
AREA. AND THAT WAS VERY COSTLY

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.426
BUT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:38.095
BECAUSE DOWN THERE WERE-

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:39.496
DEFICIT CAME FORWARD TO

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:41.331
DISCOURAGE THE BIRDS FROM

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:43.100
COLLECTING. IN CERTAIN AREAS.

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:44.301
BUT ANYWAY THOSE ARE THINGS

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:45.636
THAT ARE OF CONCERN AS WE PUT

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:47.070
TOGETHER- A PROGRAM THAT'S

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:48.906
REALLY GOING TO DO THE JOB THAT

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:49.673
YOU HOPE AND THAT WE ALL WANT

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.009
DONE- SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

00:46:52.075 --> 00:46:53.443
REALLY NEEDS COME BACK. HERE

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.912
ONCE WE GOT SOMETHING TOGETHER

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:57.080
AND IMPERATIVE. THAT WE HAVE OF

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:57.781
THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY

00:46:57.848 --> 00:46:59.349
INVOLVED IN ALL OF THAT. THAT

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:01.618
THERE AT THE TABLE. I THANK YOU

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:02.920
VERY MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS

00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.288
SENATOR OF THE BILL IN FACT TO

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:06.590
ANTICIPATE SO- THAT THERE WOULD

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:09.693
BE- IMPLEMENTATION- CUT

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.196
LEGISLATION REQUIRED. BEFORE

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:13.897
THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY MOVES

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:15.432
FORWARD SO AFTER ALL THIS DATA

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:17.467
IS. COLLECTED AND TO THE

00:47:17.534 --> 00:47:18.702
WORKING GROUP DOES ITS WORK

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:19.603
REPORTS BACK TO THE WATER

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.738
POURED. WATER BOARD-

00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:22.239
ESSENTIALLY MAKES

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:23.473
RECOMMENDATIONS ALTHOUGH I

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.274
DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WORD

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.543
THAT'S USED- AND THEN THE

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.178
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO ACT.

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:30.047
WELL THANK YOU AND AGAIN THANK

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:33.984

NOW- BECAUSE- TASK WHAT WHAT'S

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.902
IN YOUR WALLET THIS BILL SEEKS

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:53.337
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT'S

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:55.539
IN YOUR WATER- THAT'S A VERY

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:56.974
IMPORTANT QUESTION WE DON'T

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.609
KNOW IF MANY CALIFORNIANS DON'T

00:47:58.675 --> 00:47:59.409
KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:06.907
AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY TO

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:09.777
BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS MEANS A

01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:12.446
FINAL UNSATISFIED JUDGMENT

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:14.548
PASSED THE POINT OF APPEAL-

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:15.549
THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:16.850
SOMETHING FRIVOLOUS THAT WE

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:19.253
REALLY WANT. TO CREATE AN

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.056
INCENTIVE TO HAVE COMPANIES

IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CLIMATE

01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:33.500

01:39:33.567 --> 01:39:34.001
SEVEN NINETY FOUR IS AN
