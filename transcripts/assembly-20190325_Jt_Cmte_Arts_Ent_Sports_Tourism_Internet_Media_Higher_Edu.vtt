00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:38.669
RIGHT.

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:41.004
HE KNEW THAT SINGLE SEX OF P.

00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.006

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:47.144
ME TO FORCE THE CHANGE FROM MY

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:07.831
IT IS LOCATED IN AN EDUCATIONAL

EQUITY SECTION I HAVE GREAT

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:11.368
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS SINCE THE

THE PREVIOUS COMPLIANCE PROCESS.

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:34.291
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

00:46:34.358 --> 00:46:35.759
BETWEEN THE ON SITE REVIEWS THAT

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:36.894
WE CREATED.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.129
BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:40.797
WHAT IS BEING PROVIDED BY CD E.

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:43.333
NOW WITH DOCUMENT COMPLIANCE.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.068
ASSUMPTIONS AND ATTITUDES THAT

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:46.737
PEOPLE HOLD ABOUT APPROPRIATE

FEMALE AND MALE ROLES JOBS AND

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.707
BEHAVIORS CANNOT BE CHANGED BY

00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:51.375
LAW.

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:52.776
BUT THE RIGHTS PRIVILEGES

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:54.711
OPPORTUNITIES AND TREATMENT CAN

00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:57.114
AND SHOULD BE EQUALIZED WHEN

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.019
DISCRIMINATION IS AT THE

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:03.086
PROGRAM'S ROUTE.

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.888
DISCRIMINATION CAN PLAY OUT IN

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.823
PRACTICES THAT VIOLATE STUDENTS

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:09.026
CIVIL RIGHTS WE ARE ALL

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:10.727
INDIVIDUALS AND LEARN IN

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:12.996
DIFFERENT WAYS IT IS INCORRECT

00:47:13.063 --> 00:47:14.865
TO BELIEVE THE IDEA THAT THERE

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.733
ARE HARD WIRED DIFFERENCES.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.169
BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS BRAINS.

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:20.971
EVERY STUDENT LEARNS BETTER WHEN

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:22.306
THE TEACHER USES DIFFERENT

00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:24.708
STRATEGIES AND METHODS TO ENSURE

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:26.210
THAT EACH CHILD IN THE CLASSROOM

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:28.679
AS A FAIR CHANCE TO SUCCEED.

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:29.880
EQUITABLE TREATMENT OF ALL MALE

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:31.181

PRESCHOOL THROUGH UNIVERSITY

00:47:33.483 --> 00:47:34.985
WILL INCREASE FULFILLMENT OF

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:36.787
INDIVIDUAL POTENTIAL.

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:37.821
AS INDIVIDUALS EXPLORE NEW

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:39.389
OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPRESS THEIR

00:47:39.456 --> 00:47:40.190

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:41.858
THE TRADITIONAL STEREOTYPES

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:43.227
BREAK DOWN AND CHANGE BASIC

00:47:43.293 --> 00:47:44.928
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT GENDER

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:46.296

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.201
THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON MY

AYES TO GENDER FAIRNESS AND

00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:00.844
CHANGE MY CLASSROOM PRACTICES SO

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.179
THAT I COULD CREATE CLASSROOMS

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:03.180
FREE OF BIAS.

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:04.881

THEIR CLASSROOMS FREE FROM BIAS

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:10.020
RATHER THAN TURNING BACK TO

PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.181
STANDARD.

01:01:58.247 --> 01:01:59.682
IT ALSO ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR

IN THIS AREA OF INTERPRETATION

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:13.429
AND IMPLEMENTATION OF BOTH

CALIFORNIAN FEDERAL LAW ARE

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.299
IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:18.301
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS.

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:19.802
BECAUSE WHEN NOT PREVENTED OR

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.311
AND AS YOU HEARD THERE IS

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:29.812
ALREADY A SERIOUS LACK OF

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.047
REPORTING ON THESE ASSAULTS.

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:32.448

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.126
SO FOR EXAMPLE MAILING OUT

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:33.769
THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ALSO DO

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:35.338

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:51.454

I'M SUZANNE TAYLOR I. IN THE

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:57.079
SYSTEM MIGHT HAD ONLINE CORNY OR

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.414
FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.548
SYSTEM.

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:00.983
AND THERE HAVE BEEN AS YOU'VE

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.384
HEARD A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS IN

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:03.786
THE TITLE NINE WORLD SOUND

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:05.354
IMPORTANCE AND CHANGES IN A LOT

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:07.089
OF UNCERTAINTY AND SO I'M GLAD

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.490
THAT WE ALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

ON HERE TODAY.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.828
YOU SEE AS A NUMBER OF SERIOUS

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.530
CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED TITLE

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:16.398
NINE RULES MANY OF WHICH DEPUTY

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.801
ATTORNEY GENERAL FAIR I'M

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:20.369
HIGHLIGHTED IN HER PRESENTATION.

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:21.970
AND AS LARA STATED THE RULES

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:23.005
WOULD NARROW THE DEFINITION OF

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:24.840
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ALSO

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:26.041
LIMóN APPLICATION OF SCHOOLS

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.910
TITLE NINE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:28.944
TO COMPLAINTS THAT MEET CERTAIN

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.512
ADDITIONAL THRESHOLD

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:31.547
REQUIREMENTS.

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:32.648
AND I JUST PUT A NOTE THAT WE

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:34.883
HAVE OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF BOTH

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.752
ETHICAL AND LEGAL TO RESPOND TO

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:37.720
MUCH OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT THE

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:39.822
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROPOSES

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:41.156
EXCLUDING FROM TITLE.

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:42.324
AND SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.793
LOOKING AT IS IF THE RULES ARE

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.428
ON ISSUED IN THEIR CURRENT FORM.

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:48.964
IS DEVELOPING PARALLEL PROCESSES

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:49.732
ONE FOR ADDRESSING SEXUAL%

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:50.833
HARASSMENT THAT WOULD FALL UNDER

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.735
TITLE LINE AND ONE FOR DRESSING

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.570
CONDUCT THAT WOULD NOT -- AND

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.071
THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS THE POTENTIAL

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:57.339
TO BE BOTH BURDENSOME TO OUR

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:59.208
SYSTEMS AND CONFUSING TO OUR

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:00.075
COMMUNITIES WHICH IS SOMETHING

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:03.145
THAT WE TRY VERY HARD TO AVOID.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.113
AND IT'S ALSO BEEN NOTED THAT

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.347
THE RULES WOULD REQUIRE LIVE

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:06.615
HEARINGS AT WHICH PARTY'S

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:10.919
REPRESENTATIVES CONDUCT CROSS

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:12.488
EXAMINATION.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:13.055
AND I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:13.522
THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.089
SIGNIFICANTLY DISADVANTAGED

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:14.590
PARTIES WHO DON'T HAVE

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:15.724
REPRESENTATIVES OR WHOSE

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:16.825
REPRESENTATIVES ARE NOT

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:18.327
ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO CONDUCT

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:19.928
THE SORT OF ADVERSARIAL CROSS

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:21.230
EXAMINATION ARE QUESTIONING THE

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:23.799
DEPARTMENT APPARENTLY ENVISIONS.

01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:24.533
SO THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.034
CREATED IT AND INEQUITY IN THE

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:27.770
PROCESS AND THEN PUT THE ONUS ON

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.404
SCHOOLS TO CORRECT THAT AND

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:30.305
EQUITY.

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:30.873
AND I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:32.040
FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT OUR

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:33.408
CONCERNS WITH THE TITLE NINE

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:35.010
RULES DUE TO TIME BUT I JUST

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:35.911
WANT TO SAY THAT YOU SEE HAS

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:37.479
TAKEN A VERY STRONG STANCE

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.348
AGAINST PARTS OF THE PROPOSED

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:40.115
RULES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:40.949
THAT.

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:42.050
AND AT THIS POINT WE OBVIOUSLY

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:43.018
DON'T KNOW WHEN THE RULES WILL

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.586
BE ISSUED OR WHAT THEY WILL

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:46.321
ULTIMATELY REQUIRE -- AND SO

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.390
WE'RE IN A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:49.758
HOLDING PATTERN ON THAT FRONT.

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:51.260
IN THE MEANTIME THIS PAST

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:52.895
JANUARY A CALIFORNIA COURT OF

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.263
APPEAL DECIDED A CASE WITH

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:56.632
IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:57.833
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.101
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:00.769
SPECIFICALLY THE COURT RULED

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:01.770
THAT WHEN A SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:03.138
MATTER MAY RESULT IN SERIOU

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:04.506
SANCTIONS FOR A STUDENT

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.575
RESPONDENT AND CREDIBILITY

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:08.043
ESSENTIAL TO THE TO THE CASE XIN.

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.978
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MUST

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:12.114
HOLD A HUGE LIFE HEARING AT

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.315
WHICH THE RESPONDENT IS ALLOWED

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:14.683
TO QUESTION THE COMPLAINT AND

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:15.984
KEY WITNESSES AND THIS IS

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:16.819
SOMETHING THAT HAD NOT

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:18.487
PREVIOUSLY BEEN ARTICULATED BY

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:19.588
THE COURTS.

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:21.056

MODEL RATHER THAN HEARING MODEL

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.164
TO RESOLVE OUR COMPLAINTS.

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:30.232
AND UNDER THAT MODEL THE

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.567
INVESTIGATOR INTERVIEWS THE

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:32.701
RESPONDENT AND THE COMPLAINANT

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:34.670
SEPARATELY AND THE PARTIES MAKE

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:35.904
QUESTION EACH OTHER AS WELL AS

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:37.206
WITNESSES BUT THE QUESTIONS ARE

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:39.174
ASKED BY THE INVESTIGATOR DURING

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:40.742
INVESTIGATIVE PHASE.

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:41.643
AND WHILE PARTY'S COULD APPEAL

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.212
THE OUTCOME OF THE PROCESS WHICH

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:44.413
MIGHT RESULT IN THE HEARING

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:48.617
THERE WAS NO APPEAL OR HEARING

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:49.318
AS A MATTER OF RIGHT.

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:50.352
SO WHILE WE'RE WAITING TO SEE

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:51.220
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE TITLE LINE

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:51.987
RULES WE HAD TO TAKE IMMEDIATE

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:53.622
STEPS TO COMPLY WITH THIS COURT

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:54.590
RULING.

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:55.924
AND WE AT UC APPROACH THIS WITH

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.259
THE PRIMARY GOALS OF PROTECTING

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.961
BOTH THE PARTIES AND THE

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:00.195
INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS.

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:01.697
SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:03.098
IS REVISE OUR STUDENTS YOU TO

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:05.968
CATIA AND PROCESS HER FRAMEWORK

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:07.269
TO PROVIDE BOTH PARTIES

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.770
COMPLAINTS AND RESPONDENTS.

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:09.805
THE RIGHT TO AN EVIDENTIARY

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:13.275
HEARING IN ANY CASE RESULTING IN

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.276
SUSPENSION OR DISMISSAL.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:15.577
NOW WE KNOW THE PROSPECT OF A

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:16.912
LIVE HEARING IS INTIMIDATING TO

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:18.213
PARTIES AND PARTICULARLY FOR

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.314
SOMEONE WHO'S WRESTLING WITH THE

01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:21.083
ALREADY DIFFICULT DECISION ABOUT

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.384
WHETHER TO COME FORWARD AT ALL.

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:23.352
AND SO WE'RE Q. AND WE'RE

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:24.753
COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THEIR

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.121
WELL BEING IN THE PROCESS.

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:27.489
SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE TO

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:29.191
MITIGATE POTENTIAL HARM TO

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.159
PARTIES -- FROM THIS CROSS

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.961
EXAMINATION IS -- HAVE THE

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.129
QUESTIONING CONDUCTED BY THE

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:35.597
APPEAL BODY SO NOT BY THE

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:37.099
PARTIES ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES.

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:38.333
ALLOW THE PARTIES TO HAVE

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.935
SUPPORT PERSONS ALLOW THE

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:41.069
PARTIES TO BE VISUALLY OR

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.537
PHYSICALLY SEPARATED DURING

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:44.072
CROSS EXAMINATION AND THESE ARE

01:15:44.139 --> 01:15:46.575
THINGS THE COURT IS SIGNIFIED

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:47.876
ARE ACCEPTABLE.

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:48.510
NOW WHILE THIS INTERIM PROCESS

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:49.745
AND IS IN PLACE WERE ALSO

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:50.979
DEVELOPING A LONGER TERM

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:53.181
APPROACH TO CONNECTING HEARINGS

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:55.284
AND OUR GOAL IS ISSUE THIS NEW

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.852
PROCEDURE OVER THE SUMMER.

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.520
NOW IF AND WHEN THE TITLE NINE

01:15:58.587 --> 01:16:00.522
RULES ARE ISSUED WE WILL AGAIN

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:01.423
NEED TO REVISE AND REASSURE

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.991
POLICY MEETING WE WILL HAVE

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:04.593
MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF THE POLICY

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.961
IN PLACE IN A RELATIVELY SHORT

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:07.362
PERIOD OF TIME.

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:09.331
WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT IDEAL AND

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.066
SO THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:13.902
RIGHT NOW ON COMPOUNDING THAT

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:15.404
THAT YOU SEE WE RECENTLY

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:17.072
UNDERTOOK AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:18.840
TO REVISE OUR SEXUAL VIOLENCE

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.609
AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:21.877
AND THAT WAS TO COMPLY WITH AN

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:23.278
IS SIERRA RESOLUTION AGREEMENT

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.080
IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.481
THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:28.016
MORE SIGNIFICANTLY TO RESPOND TO

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.352
EXTENSIVE INPUT THAT WE RECEIVED --

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:33.488
FROM OUR COMMUNITY ON THE POLICY.

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:34.723
WE SUBMITTED THE REVISED POLICY

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.625
OCR FOR ITS APPROVAL IN FEBRUARY

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:37.693
WHICH WAS REQUIRED BY THE

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:38.961
RESOLUTION AGREEMENT.

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:40.362
AND WE HAD ANTICIPATED THEY

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:42.230
WOULD APPROVE IT THIS SPRING SO

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:42.798
THAT WE CAN ISSUE IT IN THE

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:43.799
SUMMER.

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.867
HOWEVER GIVEN THE TIMELINE RULES

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:47.069
ARE PENDING AND ARE REVISED

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:48.236
POLICY DOES NOT COMPLY WITH

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:50.339
THOSE RULES WE DON'T EXPECT IS

01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:51.974
HERE TO APPROVE THAT POLICY --

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.942
AT THIS STAGE SO THAT CREATES

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:55.610
ANOTHER LAYER OF UNCERTAINTY AND

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:56.511
SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES I'M

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:57.913
TALKING ABOUT ARE SPECIFIC TO

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.648
YOU SEE BUT MANY OF THEM ARE

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:01.984
SHARED BY OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.685
SYSTEMS IN THE STATE.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:04.353
IS A HOPE THIS SHORT

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:05.787
PRESENTATION AND HAS HELPED

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:06.955
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.557
THAT WE AND OTHERS ARE FACING

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:10.158
DURING THIS ON CERTAIN TIME.

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:11.893
AS WE WORK HARD TO FULFILL WHAT

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.096
IS -- A STRONG AND UNFALTERING

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:14.763
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING A

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.898
PROCESS THAT'S NOT ONLY FAIR AND

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:17.966
RESULTING JUSTIN RELIABLE

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:21.403
OUTCOMES BUT THE TREATS PARTIES

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.970
WITH RESPECT AND COMPASSION

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:22.270
[inaudible]

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:38.520
THANK YOU

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:19.928
.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.696
KILLER IT WAS WE WERE CONCERNED

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:23.031
ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE FACT

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:24.933
THAT THEY PROPOSE RULES WOULD BE

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.501
REDEFINING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.036
UNDER TITLE NINE IN A NARROW

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:30.338
SCOPE -- BUT WOULD NOT NARROW

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:31.807
THE SCOPE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:33.608
PROHIBITED BY OTHER LAWS IN

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:35.010
WHICH CASE THE PARALLEL PROCESS

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:36.578
THAT SUZANNE SPOKE WITH ABOUT

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:38.313
EARLIER WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.981
WE WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME --

01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:41.650
THE PROPOSED RULES ALSO A SEEK

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:42.918
TO ENSURE A FAIR GRIEVANCE

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:44.920
PROCESS IN SCHOOL JUST SIMPLER

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:46.321
AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS BY

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.589
REQUIRING DUE PROCESS

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.224
PROTECTIONS FOR RESPONDENTS.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.892
HOWEVER THESE -- DUE PROCESS

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:52.260
PROTECTIONS THAT ARTICULATED IN

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:56.031
THE PROPOSED RULES IN SOME CASES

01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:57.199
EXCEED EVEN CRIMINAL.

01:18:57.265 --> 01:18:57.799
SAYS PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:59.768
PLACE -- AND THEREFORE WE FEEL

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:01.369
IS -- AND PRY IMPRACTICAL AND

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:04.606
UNNECESSARY IN TERMS OF AN

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:07.409
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION -- WE

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:09.578
ALSO -- COMMENTED TO THE EFFECT

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:11.079
THAT THE CROSS EXAMINATION

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:12.647
REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW AN

01:19:12.714 --> 01:19:15.684
ADVISER -- CHOSEN BY THE STUDENT

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.085
I TO CROSS EXAMINE THE OTHER

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:19.454
PARTY -- WOULD GO AGAINST THE

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.389
TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES OF

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:22.190
THAT WE'VE.

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.558
WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IMPLEMENT

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:25.460
THROUGHOUT OUR CAMPUSES -- IN

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:26.728
THIS CASE IT WOULD POTENTIALLY

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.296
ALLOW FOR AN ATTORNEY WHO WAS

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:30.665
HIRED BY ONE PARTY -- TO CROSS

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:32.734
EXAMINE ANOTHER STUDENTS AND

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.035
KEEP IN MIND THE STUDENTS ARE

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.271
AVERAGING ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTEEN

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:37.939
TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD -- AND

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.307
WOULD REALLY CREATE THE SORT OF

01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:42.477
BECAUSE I JUDICIAL A SITUATION --

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.479
THE PROPOSED RULE ALSO EXCLUDES

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.081
PRIOR STATEMENTS BY PARTIES THAT

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:48.750
WERE NOT PRESENT AT THE HEARING

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.552
SO IN -- IT THEIR INVESTIGATION

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.187
PROCESS IF IT WERE DETERMINED

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.122
THAT THERE WAS A PARTY A WITNESS

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.423
TO THE EVENTS WHO HAD

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:57.125
SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION AND THAT

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:58.326
WITNESS WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR

01:19:58.393 --> 01:19:59.961
THE HEARING THE PROPOSED RULES

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:00.428
WOULD.

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:01.863
AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDE THE

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.431
ABILITY FOR THE HEARING OFFICER

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:04.799
TO CONSIDER THE TESTIMONY OF

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:06.501
THAT INDIVIDUAL.

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:08.136
SO THAT IS ALSO AND AN ERROR AND

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:10.772
WITHOUT ANY HEARSAY EXCEPTIONS --

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.274
THAT ARE NORMALLY A PARENT IN IN

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:16.645
CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:18.547
PROCEEDINGS -- SO EVEN EVEN THE

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:19.347
MOST FORMAL JUDICIAL PROCESSES

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:20.515
ALLOW FOR THIS IN SOME INSTANCES

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:21.716
AND SO OUR COMMENT SPECIFICALLY

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:23.218
ARTICULATED THE DESIRE FOR THIS

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:24.386
NOT TO BE INCLUDED.

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:26.655
IN THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:30.192
REGULATIONS -- WITH REGARDS TO

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:31.893
THE RECENT COURT OF APPEALS

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:34.296
DECISION -- WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:36.631
EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO ENSURE

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:37.899
COMPLIANCE.

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:40.001
ONCE THE DECISION WAS ISSUED AND

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.537
ON JANUARY FOURTH -- WE ACTED

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:44.139
FAIRLY SWIFTLY ESPECIALLY FOR A

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:45.640
SYSTEM AS LARGE AS OURS AND

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:47.809
ISSUED IMMEDIATE GUIDANCE TO OUR

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:49.945
CAMPUSES TO HALT ALL PROCESSES

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.646
ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:54.716
PENDING MATTERS -- AT THAT POINT --

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:57.185
WE BEGAN IMMEDIATELY WORKING ON

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:58.954
AN INTERIM POLICY SO THAT WE CAN

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.922
BECOME COMPLIANT WITH THE

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:02.490
HEARING REQUIREMENTS -- THAT

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:06.161
WERE -- MANDATED AND REQUIRED BY

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:09.164
THIS NEW DECISION -- AS A RESULT --

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:11.399
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON ALSO

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:14.436
TRAINING HEARING OFFICERS -- TO

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:15.870
BEGIN HEARINGS AND WE'RE HOPING

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:17.205
THAT THESE WILL BEGIN IN MID TO

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:19.874
LATE APRIL -- THE INTERIM POLICY

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:22.043
IS ESSENTIALLY BEEN FINALIZED

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:24.112
AND SHOULD BE IN PLACE WERE ANY

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.313
MINUTE NOW HONEY TAKE NOW

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.282
POSSIBLY -- SOME OF THE KEY

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:29.184
COMPONENTS THAT WE'VE TRIED TO

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:31.253
KEEP IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT OUR

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:20.128
HARASSMENT AND MISCONDUCT.

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:21.529
I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS QUICKLY

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:23.297
DRESSED OF A COUPLE OF A VERY

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:24.866
PROBLEMATIC POINTS ABOUT -- THAT

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:27.201
WE SHARE ABOUT THE A PROPOSED

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:28.002
REGULATIONS.

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:28.903
THAT THEY WOULD REQUIRE A LOT

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.304
HEARINGS AS AS BEEN MENTIONED

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:32.073
AND CROSS EXAMINATIONS AND

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.374
ALLOWS THE AFFECTED STUDENTS TO

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:35.476
HIRE ADVISERS TO ASSIST AND THE

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:36.310
QUESTIONING.

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:37.679
IF THE RESPONDENT OR ACCUSER

01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:42.984
CANNOT AFFORD AN ADVISER THE

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:43.551
CAMPUS MUST HIRE ONE FOR THE

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:44.585
STUDENT.

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:45.820
OUR CAMPUSES RESOURCES ARE VERY

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:46.087
DIVERSE.

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:46.721
AND FOR SOME SMALLER

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:47.689
INSTITUTIONS COULD BE THIS COULD

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:50.892
BE A VERY COSTLY -- TO IMPLEMENT.

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.593
THIS PROCESS EFFECTIVELY TURNS

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.594
OUR CAMPUSES INTO BECAUSE I

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:55.530
COURTROOMS WE BELIEVE THIS WILL

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:56.931
HAVE A CHILLING EFFECTS ON THE

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:58.433
REPORTING OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

01:28:58.499 --> 01:28:59.834
AND THE WILLINGNESS OF VICTIMS

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.235
WITNESSES AND RESPOND AS TO

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:03.604
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS.

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:04.672
THIS PROCESS TO INVESTIGATE

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:06.441
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:07.709
IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

01:29:07.775 --> 01:29:08.943
STUDENTS.

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.044
THE PUBLICATION THAT

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:11.913
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AIMS

01:29:11.979 --> 01:29:13.681
TO PROTECT INSTEAD INSTITUTIONS

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.149
SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE

01:29:15.216 --> 01:29:16.818
ABILITY TO CHOOSE HOW THEY

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.720
INVESTIGATE CLAIMS INCLUDING

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:19.887
ALLOWING QUESTIONING THROUGH A

01:29:19.954 --> 01:29:23.958
PANEL OR SUBMISSION OF QUESTIONS.

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.893
THE PROPOSED RULES ALSO REQUIRE

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.695
A SINGLE FEDERALLY MANDATED

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:29.397
EVIDENTIARY STANDARD OF PROOF.

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:30.631
ACROSS ALL DISCIPLINARY PROCESS

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:32.033
THESE.

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.968
NPR AND ALLOWS INSTITUTIONS TO

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:35.303
SELECT OTHER PREPONDERANCE OF

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:37.605
EVIDENCE OR CLEAR AND CONVINCING

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:39.307
EVIDENCE THAT STANDARD OF PROOF.

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:40.742
BUT THEY MUST ALSO APPLIED THE

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.810
SELECTION ACROSS THE BOARD THIS

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:43.811
MEANS THAT THE SAME CENTER OF

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:45.379
PROOF MUST BE ADOPTED FOR ALL

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:46.914
PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IT'S SEXUAL

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:49.517
MISCONDUCT -- EMPLOYEE

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:52.620
DISCIPLINE PLAGIARISM VIOLATIONS

01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:53.721
AT CETERA.

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:54.756
WE BELIEVE THIS ONE SIZE FITS

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.591
ALL APPROACH IS WRONG WE BELIEVE

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:58.392
THE IS THAT INSTITUTIONS SHOULD

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:00.328
HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:02.797
DEPENDING ON THE VIOLATION.

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:03.831
AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.800
NOT MICROMANAGE CAMPUS

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:07.535
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS.

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:09.103
IN REGARDS TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:10.705
COURT OF APPEALS RECENT DECISION --

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:12.640
LIKE THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS BY

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:14.142
THE US DEPARTMENT OF ED.

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:15.143
THE COURT DECISION UP AND OUR

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:17.178
INSTITUTIONS ESTABLISHED PROCESS

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:20.481
THESE -- THE DECISION SIMILAR TO

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:22.183
WHAT THE NPR IN PROPOSES TO DO

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.318
TAKES AWAY UNIVERSITIES ABILITY

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:25.753
TO CHOOSE HOW THEY INVESTIGATE

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.356
INVESTIGATE CLAIMS.

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:30.291
AND HOW THEY CONDUCT QUESTIONING.

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:31.359
OUR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:32.527
ASSESSING THE COURT DECISION TO

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:35.563
UNDERSTAND -- THE IMPACT ON

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:37.331
STUDENTS AND THEIR INVESTIGATORY

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:38.866
PROCESS SEES AND HOW THEY WOULD

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.601
NEED TO CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:41.769
TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:44.038
DECISION.

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:45.673
HOW FINISHED BY SAYING THAT AND

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.175
MISS THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE ON

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:49.544
THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS ARE

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:52.213
MEMBER CAMPUSES REMAIN COMMITTED

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.447
TO UPHOLDING CIVIL RIGHTS?

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:54.482
AND TO CREATING CAMPUS

01:30:54.549 --> 01:30:55.850
ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE SAFE AND

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:57.485
SUPPORTIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO ALL

01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:59.153
STUDENTS.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:30:59.654
AND AS BOTH LEVELS OF

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.522
GOVERNMENTS ARE DECIDING HOW TO

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:02.490
MOVE FORWARD ON THIS IMPORTANT

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:04.125
ISSUE OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:05.459
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:07.061
CONFLICT BETWEEN FEDERAL LAWS

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.529
AND STATE LAWS.

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:10.364
AND THERE IS STUDENTS BEING

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:11.499
CAUGHT IN BETWEEN.

01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:13.734
I THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE TO

HIGHER ED -- YOU YOU'RE SHOULD

01:31:28.349 --> 01:31:29.450
PRIVACY PRETTY AWARE OF THE

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:30.918
HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.320
YEARS AT THE DIFFERENT --

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:35.156
ESPECIALLY UC CAMPUSES WERE.

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:38.259
OF MY PREDECESSOR DAS WILLIAMS --

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:40.695
CONVENE UP AND DOWN THE STATE AT

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:43.965
UC SANTA BARBARA AND UCLA --

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:45.766
WHERE WE HEARD?

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:49.670
OF FROM STUDENT -- VICTIMS.

01:31:49.737 --> 01:31:53.841
RIGHT -- AND SO AT THE SEXUAL

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:55.042
HARASSMENT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:57.645
BEEN VERY IMPORTANT A TWO TO OUR

01:31:57.712 --> 01:32:01.115
COMMITTEE -- BUT AT THE SAME

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:04.986
TIME -- I THINK -- I I WAS AWARE

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:07.088
AND AND I AND I WOULD THINK THAT

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:08.256
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:10.925
DIFFERENT -- INSTITUTIONS WERE

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:13.995
PROBABLY AWARE THAT THE COURTS --

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:16.130
MIGHT NOT HAVE -- YOU KNOW EVEN

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:17.498
AS WE WERE HAVING THOSE HEARINGS

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:18.866
WE WERE HEARING THAT THE COURTS

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:20.568
MIGHT NOT UPHOLD.

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:24.939
A STRICT NOUS OF OUR RULES AS AS

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:28.175
THEY PERTAIN TO THE PERPETRATORS

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:31.145
AND TO THE PROCESSES.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:35.082
AND AND THE CONSEQUENCES.

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:40.021
AND SO HOW SURPRISE ARE WE FROM

01:32:40.087 --> 01:32:43.891
THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION.

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:48.729
I AND I AND CHANGING.

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:51.132
THE WAY -- WE HAVE.

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:53.734
TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IF YOU WILL.

01:32:53.801 --> 01:33:00.274
ARE WE SURPRISE -- I DON'T I'M

01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:01.542
NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO ANSWER

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:03.244
THAT AND I DON'T KNOW IF.

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:03.778
I WOULD SAY THAT THEY WERE

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:04.912
SUPPOSED [inaudible]

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:09.150
SURPRISED -- BUT IT DOES CREATE --

01:33:09.216 --> 01:33:12.520
IS THE SOME CONSTERNATION AND

01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:14.155
YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO AS HAS

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:15.723
BEEN MENTIONED NO LOOKING AT

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.091
THEIR PROCESS SEES AND KNOWS

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:18.359
SPECIALLY GIVEN.

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:20.294
HOW DIVERSE OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:22.363
SOME HAVE MORE RESOURCE

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.532
RESOURCES AND OTHERS -- IT

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:26.567
CREATES A CHALLENGE -- FOR MANY

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:28.836
OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AND AND

01:33:28.903 --> 01:33:31.005
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE NOW WITH

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:33.407
THE COURT OF APPEALS CHANGING

01:33:33.474 --> 01:33:33.874
THE WAY.

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.810
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:39.480
DO THE PROCESS OF OF CARRYING

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:41.716
OUT THE NOT SO MUCH THE

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:45.386
INVESTIGATION BUT THE ACTUAL --

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.455
WAY IT COMES TO A CONCLUSION

01:33:47.521 --> 01:33:52.326
RIGHT WERE GIVEN THE GIVEN THE

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:53.194
ALLEGED PERPETRATOR THE

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.962
OPPORTUNITY.

01:33:55.029 --> 01:33:58.366
TO ADDRESS -- THE THE VICTIM

01:33:58.432 --> 01:34:00.601
CORRECT THAT THAT'S A CHANGE IS

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:01.302
THAT RIGHT.

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:02.770
RIGHT SO FOR MANY YEARS THE

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:04.939
SINGLE INVESTIGATOR MODEL HAD

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:06.474
BEEN A MODEL THAT WAS I'M

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.209
CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE IN THE

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:09.844
CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHAT THAT

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.679
MODEL MEN'S WAS THAT.

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:12.646
THERE WOULD BE ONE INVESTIGATOR

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:13.848
WHO WOULD CONDUCT THE

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:16.751
INVESTIGATION -- MAKE FINDINGS

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:17.985
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.553
GOING TO POLICY VIOLATION AND

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.888
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:23.290
SANCTIONS -- WHAT THE COURTS

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:25.726
HAVE NOW REQUIRED IS THAT THERE

01:34:25.793 --> 01:34:27.194
IS A HEARING PROCESS THAT IS

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.196
ALLOWS FOR A SEPARATE HEARING

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:31.065
OFFICER? TO REVIEW THE

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:34.502
INVESTIGATORY -- REPORT OF THE

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:36.570
INVESTIGATOR AND THEN MAKE THE

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:39.640
FINDINGS -- FROM THEIR SEPARATE

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.108
SPHERE -- THEIR SEPARATE

01:34:41.175 --> 01:34:43.744
PERSPECTIVE -- IS SO SORRY JUST

01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:44.412
TO SPEAK TO YOUR EARLIER

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:45.312
QUESTION.

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:47.648
EITHER WAS -- SOME INDICATION

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:49.016
THAT THE COURTS WERE MOVING IN

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:53.220
THIS DIRECTION IT WAS NOT A

01:34:53.287 --> 01:34:54.422
COMPLETE AND TOTAL SURPRISE.

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:55.089
HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT I THINK

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:56.257
IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR MANY TIMES

01:34:56.323 --> 01:34:58.292
BEFORE AND EVEN THE COURT OF

01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:58.826
APPEALS HAVE SAT IN PRIOR

01:34:58.893 --> 01:34:59.927
RULINGS.

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:01.262
THAT THESE OUR CLASSROOMS AND

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:03.497
NOT COURT ROOMS SO THE DEGREE TO

01:35:03.564 --> 01:35:07.001
WHICH THE COURT HAS SEEN TO IT --

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:09.470
TRANSPOSON TO AN EDGE WHAT HAS

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.738
NORMALLY BEEN AN EDUCATIONAL

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:12.940
PROCESS I THINK IT'S CAUGHT SOME

01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:14.308
OF US BY SURPRISE.

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:16.010
HEY AND JUST SO FOR MY OWN

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:17.378
CLARIFICATION.

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:18.913
AMONG THE CHANGES THAT THE COURT

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:22.183
SAID IS THAT THE ALLEGE PEPPERED

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:26.487
PERPETRATOR HAS THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:27.121
TO TO QUESTION IS THAT THAT'S A

HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOLS IN

01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:27.774
CALIFORNIA. ONE POINT NINE

01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:29.810
MILLION -- HIGH SCHOOL AGE

01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:32.312
STUDENTS BUT ABOUT SIX POINT TWO

01:47:44.991 --> 01:47:45.559
IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO

YOU CAN SEE PROGRESS HAS BEEN

01:47:54.234 --> 01:47:55.936
MADE.

01:47:56.002 --> 01:47:57.637
IF YOU LOOK IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:47:57.704 --> 01:47:58.905
FOUR NUMBER OF KIDS OR

01:47:58.972 --> 01:47:59.439
PARTICIPATE IN HIGH SCHOOL

01:47:59.506 --> 01:48:00.574

NUMBERS OF TOTAL PARTICIPANTS.

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:09.349
HIGH SCHOOL ENROLLMENT IS

01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:10.817
ACTUALLY GONE DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

01:48:10.884 --> 01:48:12.352
SO WHAT'S GOOD IS BORN MORE BOYS

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:14.020
AND GIRLS ARE PARTICIPATING IN

01:48:14.087 --> 01:48:15.422
ATHLETICS THAT SOIT SHOWS YOU

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:17.958
THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE OFFERING

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:20.193
MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS.

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:22.295

KIDS.

01:48:27.133 --> 01:48:27.634
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBER

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:28.869
THOUGH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:48:28.935 --> 01:48:30.136
NUMBER OF MALE AND FEMALE

01:48:30.203 --> 01:48:31.638

01:48:35.942 --> 01:48:37.577
IT'S CLOSED.

01:48:37.644 --> 01:48:38.211
BUT THAT STILL SIGNIFICANT GAP.

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.279
IN ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE SEEM

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:40.247
TO FORGET AND THAT'S WHY I WAS

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:41.915

01:48:46.453 --> 01:48:48.355
KIDS PLAY BECAUSE IT'S FUN.

01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:49.956
MEET ALL THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IT

01:48:50.023 --> 01:48:51.491
ON MY WORLD OF ATHLETICS IS

01:48:51.558 --> 01:48:54.127
ISN'T THE KIDS THE KIDS ARE OKAY.

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:55.962
BUT IS THE ADULTS IN US OFFERING

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:57.197
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:48:57.264 --> 01:48:58.265
SO THERE'S THE NUMBERS IN HERE

01:48:58.331 --> 01:48:59.466
IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I

01:48:59.532 --> 01:49:01.034
THINK OUR SCHOOLS FACE TODAY IS

01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:02.435
THAT LITTLE RED ERROL AT THE

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:04.471
BOTTOM.

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:07.173
WHEN I'M SIXTY FIVE I'M A LITTLE

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:08.275
OLD I'M RETIRED?

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:10.310
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL ALL OF

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:11.912
MY COACHES WERE TEACHERS AT

01:49:11.978 --> 01:49:13.413
SCHOOL THAT'S NOT THE CASE

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.750
ANYMORE 72% OF THE TEACHERS

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:18.718
COACHES OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS

01:49:18.785 --> 01:49:20.120
IN CALIFORNIA ARE WALKEN'S?

01:49:20.186 --> 01:49:21.688
GREAT MEN AND WOMEN THEY COME TO

01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:23.056
SCHOOL.

01:49:23.123 --> 01:49:24.557
AFTER SCHOOL IS OUT SO THEY

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:26.192
DON'T SEE THEIR KIDS AT ALL

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:28.628
ACCEPTED PRACTICE ONE OF THE

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:29.362
ISSUES I THINK.

01:49:29.429 --> 01:49:31.031
IN THIS IS PURELY ANECDOTAL FROM

01:49:31.097 --> 01:49:32.499
MY STANDPOINT WHAT THAT'S A BIG

01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:34.367
ISSUE BECAUSE THAT TEACHER ON

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:37.003
CAMPUS THAT SEES A GOOD STUDENT

01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:38.004
A GOOD KIDS.

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:39.606
IS THAT RECRUITING THEM TO COME

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:41.074
PLAY SPORTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:42.509
INVOLVED OR NOT INVOLVED IN THE

01:49:42.575 --> 01:49:45.946
CHESS CLUB THE DRUMMER ANYTHING.

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:47.514
BECAUSE THEY'RE GREAT.

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:48.548
BUT THE VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:49.149
AFTER SCHOOL SO THAT CREATES A

01:49:49.215 --> 01:49:51.351
PROBLEM ON OUR CAMPUSES FOR OUR

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.420
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS.

01:49:53.486 --> 01:49:55.889

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.666
FEMALES -- THE SECOND THING THAT

01:59:00.733 --> 01:59:02.635
I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT WHEN

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.403
WE COMPARE TEXAS WHO WAS NUMBER

01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:05.771

MORE KIDS PARTICIPATING SO WE'RE

01:59:09.542 --> 01:59:10.943

01:59:11.010 --> 01:59:13.112
CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS MORE

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:15.114
FEMALES PARTICIPATING SO LOTS OF

01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:16.449
PEOPLE ARE AS WE DO -- YOU KNOW

01:59:18.451 --> 01:59:19.185
THOUSAND MORE FEMALES ARE

01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:23.089

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:23.689
TO SEE THAT WHEN I WAS LOOKING

01:59:23.756 --> 01:59:24.390
THROUGH THE DATA.

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:26.125
AND THE NEXT THING.

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:27.593
THAT I WANT TO GO OVER IS I PUT

01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:28.594
IN A CALL IN THE QUALITY AND

01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:30.229
ATHLETIC SO -- AGAIN I'M NOT A

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:31.430
SINGLE SITE I SEE THE SMALLER

01:59:31.497 --> 01:59:32.398
SCHOOL DIVISIONS BECAUSE I'M AT

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:34.066
A SMALLER SCHOOL WE PLAY LIKE

01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:36.202
THE FORTY FIVE D. SIX AND I

01:59:36.269 --> 01:59:37.370
ACTUALLY EMAILED OUT TO ALL OF

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:38.604

AND I GIVE A SURVEY.

01:59:41.474 --> 01:59:42.208
AND I KIND OF WANTED TO SEE

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:43.309
WHERE EVERYBODY WAS WHERE THEY

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:44.744
SAW THAT THEY FELT THAT THEY

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:45.545
WERE.

01:59:45.611 --> 01:59:47.346
ON BOARD WITH WHAT THEY FELT

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:49.181
THEY AGREED WITH VERSES -- WHERE

01:59:49.248 --> 01:59:51.150
THEY DID IT SO AS YOU CAN SEE --

01:59:51.217 --> 01:59:52.318
PETE'S TYPE IN AMOUNTS OF THE

01:59:52.385 --> 01:59:54.220
DOLLAR AMOUNT -- THEY AGREED TO

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:55.521
WITH THE PRACTICE FACILITIES

01:59:55.588 --> 01:59:56.689
THEY AGREED WERE -- PRETTY

01:59:56.756 --> 01:59:59.225
EQUITABLE ALLOCATION OF TRAVEL

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:01.227
AND TRANSPORTATION SO BOYS AND

02:00:01.294 --> 02:00:02.895

UNLOCK ROOM FACILITY FACILITIES

02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:10.336
SO THE MIXER RESPONSES -- WHICH

02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:11.537
IS A GREAT TO SEE BECAUSE IT'S

02:00:11.604 --> 02:00:12.905
ABOUT HALF OF THE ITEMS THAT I

02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:15.441
THAT I PUT OUT THERE WAS A

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:17.910
PUBLICITY SO THIS ALL THAT --

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:18.578
ONE SIX IS BEING MORE PUBLICIZED

02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:20.980

FOR NOT WHAT ACTUALLY TRAINER

02:00:22.081 --> 02:00:23.449

02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:30.356
THERE.

02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:31.424
A TRAINER THAT TYPE OF THING SO

02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:32.959
THAT'S MY THOUGHT I'M GOING IN

02:00:33.025 --> 02:00:33.993
THAT DIRECTION MAYBE THAT'S

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:35.962
WHERE THE UNFAIRNESS WAS -- THE

02:00:36.028 --> 02:00:37.163
FOURTH ONE WAS EQUITY IN FUNDS

02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:38.831
PROVIDED BY THE DISTRICT TO PAY

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:39.665
FOR EQUIPMENT.

02:00:39.732 --> 02:00:41.400
SO WITH IN MY DISTRICT WE

02:00:41.467 --> 02:00:42.735
ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE BOOSTERS SO

02:00:42.802 --> 02:00:44.470
THE SO OUR DISTRICT ACTUALLY

02:00:44.537 --> 02:00:45.871
PROVIDES A LOT OF MONEY -- FOR

02:00:45.938 --> 02:00:47.840
OUR FOR OUR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:49.842
AND SO -- MY THOUGHTS AGAIN WITH

02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:56.582
THIS ONE ARE.

02:00:56.649 --> 02:01:00.152
FOOTBALL HELMETS PADS. FOR A

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:00.753
HUNDRED HUNDRED TWENTY KIDS IS

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:01.387
PRETTY EXPENSIVE -- THE CLEMENT

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:01.988
BUT THE UTILIZES EXPENSIVE SO

02:01:02.054 --> 02:01:02.855
I'M JUST THINKING IN IN THAT

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:03.889
ASPECT THAT MAYBE.

02:01:03.956 --> 02:01:05.625
THAT'S WHERE THE INEQUITY OF

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:06.258
FUNDS IS FROM AND THE COACHING

02:01:06.325 --> 02:01:08.894
POSITION SO -- YOU LOOK AT A

02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:10.529
FOOTBALL STAFF WHICH USUALLY HAS.

02:01:10.596 --> 02:01:11.864
I DON'T KNOW TEN MAYBE YOU KNOW

02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:12.732
DEPENDING ON HOW MANY LEVELS

02:01:12.798 --> 02:01:14.433
THEY HAVE AND YOU CAN'T REALLY

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:17.103
COMPARE OF FOOTBALL STAFF TO OF

02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:18.504
ALL ABLE STAFF. FOR SOFTBALL

02:01:18.571 --> 02:01:20.539
STAFF SO GOING THROUGH THAT --

02:01:20.606 --> 02:01:22.074
SO ATTENTION AREAS I'M GONNA GO

02:01:22.141 --> 02:01:23.676
BACK TO THE NUMBERS -- SO

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:25.277
FOOTBALL'S NUMBER ONE SO IN THE

02:01:25.344 --> 02:01:26.312
NATION WE HAVE.

02:01:26.379 --> 02:01:27.947
MILLION KIDS OVER MILLION KIDS

02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:29.548
EVERY YEAR PLAYING FOOTBALL AND

02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:30.683
THERE'S REALLY.

02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:32.685
NO OTHER SPORT THAT CAN COMPARE

02:01:32.752 --> 02:01:34.286
LOOKING AT THE FEMALE ASPECTS OF

02:01:34.353 --> 02:01:36.722
TEXAS HAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:39.025
FOUR THOUSANDS OF PARTICIPATING

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:39.759
CALIFORNIA HAS NINETY FOUR AND

02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:41.494
THEN THE THIRD. ONE IS ACTUALLY

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:43.863
BUT FORTY TWO THOUSAND SO -- WE

02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:45.564
ARE IN THEM UP THERE WITH THE

02:01:45.631 --> 02:01:47.066
MOUNTIE KIDS PARTICIPATING SO

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:47.700
THEN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK

02:01:47.767 --> 02:01:49.068
AT NUMBERS.

02:01:49.135 --> 02:01:50.536
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T COMPARE.

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:52.672
THE MALES TO FEMALES -- BUT THEN

02:01:52.738 --> 02:01:54.173
IF LOOKING OVER AT THE MALES

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:55.341
THEY ACTUALLY.

02:01:55.408 --> 02:01:56.976
THE TRACK AND FIELD AND FOOTBALL

02:01:57.043 --> 02:01:57.576
IS.

02:01:57.643 --> 02:01:58.944
THE MOST POPULAR SPORTS FOR

02:01:59.011 --> 02:02:01.580
MALES AND FEMALES -- BUT YOU CAN

02:02:01.647 --> 02:02:02.915
SEE THEY STILL HAVE AN

02:02:02.982 --> 02:02:03.949
OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT A NUMBER MORE

02:02:04.016 --> 02:02:06.485
MALES PARTICIPATING THAN FEMALES

02:02:06.552 --> 02:02:07.153
AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN AT

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:09.155
TENNIS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TENNIS

02:02:09.221 --> 02:02:11.624
HAS MORE FEMALE SO THAT'S GREAT

02:02:11.691 --> 02:02:12.825
TO SEE THAT THE MALLS THERE IS A

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:13.492
FEW MOST WORN OUT THERE THAT HAS

02:02:13.559 --> 02:02:13.893
MORE.

02:02:13.959 --> 02:02:15.995
PARTICIPANTS THAN MALES -- BUT

02:02:16.062 --> 02:02:16.862
YOU COULD SEE THERE'S JUST AN

02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:17.763
OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF STUDENTS

02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:19.365
WHO ARE -- THE PARTICIPATING

02:02:19.432 --> 02:02:20.332
WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE ASYOU

02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:22.435
CAN SEE OUR NUMBERS ARE HIGH BUT

02:02:22.501 --> 02:02:23.969
THERE'S STILL MORE -- MALES.

02:02:24.036 --> 02:02:26.772
PARTICIPATING THEN -- FEMALES SO

02:02:26.839 --> 02:02:28.674
BIG THING IS LET'S TALK MONEY IS

02:02:28.741 --> 02:02:30.676
SO AGAIN WITH THE WHEN THIS IS

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:32.011
WHAT THE SURVEY I SENT OUT -- IT

02:02:32.078 --> 02:02:35.347
WAS -- OVERWHELMINGLY I THINK

02:02:35.414 --> 02:02:36.916
THERE'S ONE PROGRAM THAT SAID

02:02:36.982 --> 02:02:38.684
THAT BASKETBALL WAS THEIR NUMBER

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:40.052
ONE PRODUCING REVENUE.

02:02:40.119 --> 02:02:41.854
FOOTBALL WAS NUMBER ONE FOR

02:02:41.921 --> 02:02:43.055
EVERYBODY SO THAT'S WHERE THE

02:02:43.122 --> 02:02:45.791
MONEY MAKER IS AND MY DISTRICT

02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:46.358
THEN OUT AND A LOT OF OTHER

02:02:46.425 --> 02:02:47.293
DISTRICTS.

02:02:47.359 --> 02:02:48.327
FOOTBALL REVENUE PAYS FOR

02:02:48.394 --> 02:02:49.729
TOURNAMENTS OFFICIALS THAT'S

02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:51.330
WHAT THAT'S WHERE YOUR BANK IS

02:02:51.397 --> 02:02:53.899
SO -- MY ASSUMPTION IS MORE TIME

02:02:53.966 --> 02:02:55.634
MONEY AND EFFORT IS TYPICALLY

02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:57.937
SPENT ON FOOTBALL -- IT'S NOT A

02:02:58.003 --> 02:02:59.371
GREAT THING TO SEE BUT AS AN

02:02:59.438 --> 02:03:01.474
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR I KNOW WHEN

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:02.742
FROM FRIDAY NIGHT COMES THERE'S

02:03:02.808 --> 02:03:04.310
A LOT THAT GOES INTO IT YOU HAVE

02:03:04.376 --> 02:03:05.945
TO ALIGN YOUR OFFICIALS --

02:03:06.011 --> 02:03:13.686
SECURITY -- CROWD CONTROL ARE

02:03:13.753 --> 02:03:14.286
YOU HAVING OF EVENT THAT NIGHT

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:16.055
TO PER.

02:03:16.122 --> 02:03:16.889
YOUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL --

02:03:16.956 --> 02:03:17.656
THERE'S JUST A LOT OF THAT GOES

02:03:17.723 --> 02:03:18.491
INTO FOOTBALL WHICH IS YOUR

02:03:18.557 --> 02:03:19.391
NUMBER ONE PRODUCING A LOT OF

02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:20.259
TIMES FOOTBALLS.

02:03:20.326 --> 02:03:21.193
YOUR SCHOOL LIKE THAT'S WHAT

02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:22.228
REPRESENTED REPRESENTS YOUR

02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:22.895
SCHOOL IS YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM --

02:03:22.962 --> 02:03:24.597
IT'S NOT GREAT TO SEE -- BUT

02:03:24.663 --> 02:03:25.898
WHEN THE FALL COMES THAT'S

02:03:25.965 --> 02:03:28.701
TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS -- AND

02:03:28.768 --> 02:03:31.337
BOYS BASKETBALL -- YOU CAN EARN

02:03:31.403 --> 02:03:32.738
A BASS BASKETBALL OR SOCCER

02:03:32.805 --> 02:03:35.608
THERE YOU CAN COMPARE THE TWO SO

02:03:35.674 --> 02:03:36.242
THAT'S KINDA WHAT I MEAN ABOUT

02:03:36.308 --> 02:03:37.710
EQUALITY IS YOU CAN COMPARE BUT

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:38.577
THERE'S REALLY NO.

02:03:38.644 --> 02:03:40.079
THE MOST MORE THAT COMPARES TO

02:03:40.146 --> 02:03:42.214
FOOTBALL AND THEN -- I DID WANT

02:03:42.281 --> 02:03:42.982
TO KNOW WHAT THE SAUDIS FOR

02:03:43.048 --> 02:03:44.850
PLAYOFFS IN THE CENTRAL SECTION

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:47.086
WE ARE ACTUALLY MOVING AND I

02:03:47.153 --> 02:03:48.788
KNOW BASEBALL IS AT A MINOR

02:03:48.854 --> 02:03:50.790
LEAGUE FACILITY FOR BASEBALL AND

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:52.291
THEN THAT WOULD HAPPEN FOR A

02:03:52.358 --> 02:03:53.859
YEAR AND THEN WE ACTUALLY MOVED.

02:03:53.926 --> 02:03:55.027
US OFF ALL TO THE PRESENT STATE

02:03:55.094 --> 02:03:56.562
MARTY RIGHT STADIUM SO THAT

02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:58.364
THAT'S COMPARATIVO I'M NOT SURE

02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.998
ABOUT.

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:01.000
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE STATE

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:03.502
WE ALSO HAVE A BASKETBALL

02:04:03.569 --> 02:04:04.837
PLAYOFFS AT HOME SO AN ARENA IN

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:07.106
FRESNO AND THEN I KNOW THE STATE

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:10.810
WE HAVE IT AT WAS KEPT COUPLE.

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:11.610
ONE GOLDEN GOLDEN ONE THERE YOU

02:04:11.677 --> 02:04:12.978
GOT MORE THAN ONE CENTER SO IT

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:13.813
WAS IT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT OUR

02:04:13.879 --> 02:04:15.014
OUR KIDS ARE ABLE TO GO INTO

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.049
THOSE SITUATIONS AND PLAY AND

02:04:17.116 --> 02:04:18.184
FACILITIES THAT.

02:04:18.250 --> 02:04:19.718
ARE -- NOT JUST SPECIFIC TO

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:21.987
THEIR SCHOOL -- BUT I KNOW THE

02:04:22.054 --> 02:04:23.856
CENTRAL SECTION HAS SAID WOULD

02:04:23.923 --> 02:04:24.490
THEY MAKE MORE MONEY WHEN IT'S

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:26.192
AT THESE FACILITIES BECAUSE YOU

02:04:26.258 --> 02:04:28.027
HAVE ALL THE SPORTS IN ONE AREA

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:29.094
SO AGAIN SOMETIMES THAT'S MONEY

02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:32.498
DRIVEN -- I ALSO IN THE SURVEY I

02:04:32.565 --> 02:04:33.899
ASKED HOW MANY SCHOOLS WERE IN

02:04:33.966 --> 02:04:35.801
MARIN MEASURES AND THERE'S ABOUT

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:37.069
55% OF SCHOOLS THAT HAD BOND

02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:37.970
MEASURES.

02:04:38.037 --> 02:04:39.371
THAT WERE BEING USED TOWARDS

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:41.574
ATHLETICS SO -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.009
BUDGETS -- LIKE YOU SAID WAS A

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:46.512
2% OF IT IS IS WITH ATHLETIC SO

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:47.146
THEY'RE LOOKING TO THE

02:04:47.213 --> 02:04:49.348
COMMUNITIES TO TO FIND THESE

SO I KNOW IN THE FUTURE THAT'S

02:04:57.523 --> 02:04:58.023
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK TO

02:04:58.090 --> 02:05:05.197
BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE AND WE

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:06.765
DO WANT.

02:05:06.832 --> 02:05:07.666

SAID NO WE ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:36.455
AS FOOTBALL AND EVERY OTHER

02:06:36.522 --> 02:06:38.490
SPORT IN THIS UNIVERSITY AND WE

02:06:38.557 --> 02:06:40.292
CANNOT USE FEDERAL FUNDS TO

DISCRIMINATE SO THANK YOU TITLE

FOR GENDER EQUALITY WITH A

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:51.236
SPECIFIC FOCUS ON AN EQUITY IN

02:06:51.303 --> 02:06:53.172
ATHLETICS FOR THE THREE MILLION

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:55.307
GIRLS IN GRADES K. THROUGH

02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:56.742
TWELVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

02:06:56.809 --> 02:06:58.744
WE'VE SEEK TO BRING ABOUT EQUITY

02:06:58.811 --> 02:07:00.879
FOR GIRLS USING TITLE NINE AND

02:07:00.946 --> 02:07:02.181
RELATED CALIFORNIA LAW.

02:07:02.247 --> 02:07:03.816
PARTICULARLY THOSE -- FOR THOSE

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:04.950
IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND

02:07:05.017 --> 02:07:06.885
GIRLS OF COLOR WHO STATISTICALLY

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:08.020
HAVE THE FEWEST SPORTS

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:11.357
OPPORTUNITIES IN COMPARISON TO

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:12.391
THE U. SPEARS.

02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:13.225
AND WE WORKED IN THE STATE FOR

02:07:13.292 --> 02:07:14.693
OVER FIFTEEN YEARS ON TITLE NINE

02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:16.562
MATTERS REPRESENTING GIRLS AND

02:07:16.628 --> 02:07:18.097
THEIR FAMILIES OR SCHOOLS ARE

02:07:18.163 --> 02:07:20.432
REATING GIRLS AS A SECOND CLASS

02:07:20.499 --> 02:07:22.034
THESE GIRLS ARE STANDING UP TO

02:07:22.101 --> 02:07:24.169
MAKE CHANGE WITH OUR ASSISTANCE.

02:07:24.236 --> 02:07:26.238
AND FAIR PLAY FURTHER PROVIDES

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:27.740
TRAINING AND TECHNICAL HELP.

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.908
AND LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY TO MOVE

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:31.410
TOWARD THE GOAL OF GENDER EQUITY

02:07:31.477 --> 02:07:32.611
FOR OUR STUDENTS ONCE AND FOR

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:34.380
ALL AND I JUST WANT TO ADVERTISE

02:07:34.446 --> 02:07:35.481
THAT ANYONE IN THIS ROOM WHO

02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:36.582
WANTS A TITLE NINE TRAINING.

02:07:36.648 --> 02:07:37.750
WE'RE READY TO DO IT BECAUSE I

02:07:37.816 --> 02:07:39.385
THINK AS ALL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE

02:07:39.451 --> 02:07:40.085
BIT MORE THERE'S SOME

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:42.321
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW THE

02:07:42.388 --> 02:07:42.955
LAW WORKS AND WE NEED TO CHANGE

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:43.889
THAT.

02:07:43.956 --> 02:07:45.591
SO DESPITE GREAT STRIDES WITH

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:46.392
TITLE NINE APPROACHING ITS

02:07:46.458 --> 02:07:47.860
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY

02:07:47.926 --> 02:07:49.595
UNFORTUNATELY MILLIONS OF GIRLS

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:51.463
NATIONWIDE AND IN CALIFORNIA ARE

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:53.866
BEING SIMPLY TREATED WORSE THAN

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:55.434
THE BOYS.

02:07:55.501 --> 02:07:57.336
SO LIKE A ONE LIKE A YOUNG WOMAN

02:07:57.403 --> 02:07:58.537
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO

02:07:58.604 --> 02:07:59.938
SOUGHT THE HELP OF FAIR PLAY

02:08:00.005 --> 02:08:01.507
BECAUSE IN HER WORDS AND HER

02:08:01.573 --> 02:08:03.375
PUBLIC SCHOOL.

02:08:03.442 --> 02:08:04.610
IT WAS LACKING RESOURCES FOR

02:08:04.676 --> 02:08:06.278
GIRLS WHILE PUTTING BOYS ON A

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:07.813
PEDESTAL AND GIVING THEM THE

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:09.014
BEST FACILITIES.

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:10.749
ACTORS ASSERTING A TITLE NINE

02:08:10.816 --> 02:08:12.217
COMPLAINT AGAINST HER SCHOOL

02:08:12.284 --> 02:08:13.886
CHANGES WERE MADE TO IMPROVE AN

02:08:13.952 --> 02:08:15.354
EQUALIZED GIRLS ATHLETICS THERE

02:08:15.421 --> 02:08:17.156
AND SHE SAID TITLE NINE GIVE

02:08:17.222 --> 02:08:19.858
GIRLS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE.

02:08:19.925 --> 02:08:21.193
JUST AS MUCH AS THE BOYS.

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:22.895
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY AND

02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:23.395
I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP

02:08:23.462 --> 02:08:24.329
REMEMBERING THAT.

02:08:24.396 --> 02:08:26.131
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS PROBLEM

02:08:26.198 --> 02:08:27.699
OF ATHLETIC INEQUITY WHY DOES IT

02:08:27.766 --> 02:08:29.268
MATTER AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

02:08:29.334 --> 02:08:30.736
ABOUT IT AFTER TODAY.

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:32.171
EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA OUR

02:08:32.237 --> 02:08:33.272
ELEMENTARY MIDDLE AND HIGH

02:08:33.338 --> 02:08:34.773
SCHOOLS ARE TELLING GIRLS YOU

02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.341
CAN DO ANYTHING IF YOU STUDY

02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:37.976
HARD FOR ALL THE RULES AND

02:08:38.043 --> 02:08:38.811
GRADUATE.

02:08:38.877 --> 02:08:40.446
THE GIRLS ARE ALSO GETTING A

02:08:40.512 --> 02:08:41.880
CORROSIVE MESSAGE FROM SCHOOLS

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:44.016
THAT THEY DON'T COUNT AS MUCH AS

02:08:44.083 --> 02:08:45.584
THEIR MALE PEERS ON OUR KEY TOLD

02:08:45.651 --> 02:08:46.552
CAMPUSES.

02:08:46.618 --> 02:08:47.820
IN THE WORDS OF ANOTHER FAIR

02:08:47.886 --> 02:08:49.788
PLAY KLEIN IN HIGH SCHOOL I FEEL

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:51.990
LIKE I'M LEFT OUT AND CONSTANTLY

02:08:52.057 --> 02:08:53.492
HAVING TO FIGHT FOR MY EQUITY

02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:55.194
AND WORK FIVE TIMES HARDER FOR

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.929
THE OPPORTUNITIES AND SUCCESSES

02:08:56.995 --> 02:08:59.164
THAT I WANT AS AN ATHLETE.

02:08:59.231 --> 02:09:01.233
IT FEELS LIKE WE GIRLS DON'T

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:02.367
MATTER AS MUCH.

02:09:02.434 --> 02:09:04.269
SO FOR EXAMPLE ACROSS THE STATE

02:09:04.336 --> 02:09:06.038
SCHOOLS ARE AFFORDING BOYS

02:09:06.105 --> 02:09:07.739
LARGER MORE UP TO DATE ATHLETIC

02:09:07.806 --> 02:09:09.842
LOCKER ROOMS AND ACCESS TO THE

02:09:09.908 --> 02:09:12.344
PREFERRED JAMS AND FIELDS AND IN

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:14.113
CONTRAST GIRLS HAVE SMALLER

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:16.748
LOCKER ROOMS WITH LESS AMENITIES

02:09:16.815 --> 02:09:18.250
OR NO LOCKER ROOM AT ALL.

02:09:18.317 --> 02:09:21.587
AND THEY HAVE THE WORST ATHLETIC

02:09:21.653 --> 02:09:23.021
FACILITIES FOR PRACTICE AND PLAY.

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:24.056
NO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR AND

02:09:24.123 --> 02:09:24.623
WANT TO DO A QUICK POINT OF

02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:25.390
EDUCATION HERE TO MY CO

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:27.426
PANELISTS WHO VERY CAREFULLY AND

02:09:27.493 --> 02:09:28.861
AND HOPEFULLY TALK ABOUT WHAT

02:09:28.927 --> 02:09:30.129
WHAT THEY'RE SEEING.

02:09:30.195 --> 02:09:31.163
TREATMENT IN BENEFITS IS ONE

02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:33.065
AREA OF TITLE NINE SO WE HAVE TO

02:09:33.132 --> 02:09:33.832
LOOK AT THE WHOLE ATHLETIC

02:09:33.899 --> 02:09:35.534
PROGRAM AND LOOK AT WHAT ALL THE

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:37.102
BOYS AND ALL THE GIRLS ARE

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:38.837
GETTING ON THEIR DIFFERENT TEAMS.

02:09:38.904 --> 02:09:40.139
VERY CLEARLY TITLE NINE IN THE

02:09:40.205 --> 02:09:41.507
REGULATION SAY THERE'S NO

02:09:41.573 --> 02:09:44.076
EXCEPTION FOR FOOTBALL IT

02:09:44.143 --> 02:09:45.511
DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE A

02:09:45.577 --> 02:09:47.746
HUNDRED BOYS PLAYING FOOTBALL.

02:09:47.813 --> 02:09:48.647
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:50.048
THERE'S EQUITABLE TREATMENT

02:09:50.115 --> 02:09:51.116
BENEFITS FOR THE GIRLS ON THE

02:09:51.183 --> 02:09:52.317
GIRLS SIDE.

02:09:52.384 --> 02:09:53.452
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A MORE

02:09:53.519 --> 02:09:55.053
EXPENSIVE FOOTBALL UNIFORMS BUT

02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:56.421
THE SOFTBALL GIRLS NEED TO HAVE

02:09:56.488 --> 02:09:58.190
A TOP NOTCH UNIFORM AS WELL AND

02:09:58.257 --> 02:09:59.892
ALL THE ELEMENTS FOR THE SUPPORT

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:00.692
THAT THEY NEED SAME WITH THE

02:10:00.759 --> 02:10:01.293
SWIMMERS.

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.561
SAME WITH FIELD HOCKEY WHATEVER

02:10:02.628 --> 02:10:04.763
IT MAY BE FOOTBALL GREAT SPORT

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:06.131
NOT AGAINST IT WE JUST WANNA

02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:07.799
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO

02:10:07.866 --> 02:10:09.601
FOOTBALL EXCEPTION IN TITLE NINE

02:10:09.668 --> 02:10:10.402
AND WE HEAR THAT TOO OFTEN FROM

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:11.937
SCHOOLS.

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:13.272
THAT THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT.

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:14.740
AS THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLAY A

02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:16.074
GIRLS MAKE UP HALF OF OUR

02:10:16.141 --> 02:10:17.676
CALIFORNIA STUDENT BODY AND

02:10:17.743 --> 02:10:19.578
RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS THEY WANT

02:10:19.645 --> 02:10:20.379
TO PLAY SPORTS AS MUCH AS THE

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:22.047
BOYS ESPECIALLY IF THE SPORTS

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:23.815
ARE OFFERED IN THE RIGHT WAY.

02:10:23.882 --> 02:10:25.050
SO THAT MEANS IF YOU HEAR AN

02:10:25.117 --> 02:10:26.785
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR SAY NO GIRLS

02:10:26.852 --> 02:10:27.886
AT THE SCHOOL WANTED TO PLAY

02:10:27.953 --> 02:10:29.655
SOFTBALL AND THEN YOU FIND OUT

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:31.023
THAT THE SOFTBALL FIELD IS UNDER

02:10:31.089 --> 02:10:32.157
THE FREEWAY.

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:32.991
AND THE BOYS BASEBALL FIELD THE

02:10:33.058 --> 02:10:34.793
CENTRAL CAMPUS THERE'S A REASON

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:35.861
THEY'RE NOT PLANNING SO I CAN'T

02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:36.962
WAIT FOR THOSE UPGRADED

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:39.298
FACILITIES TO COME BECAUSE IT'S

02:10:39.364 --> 02:10:39.898
GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND

02:10:39.965 --> 02:10:41.366
PARTICIPATION.

02:10:41.433 --> 02:10:43.202
AND THEN IF GIRLS HAVE EQUAL

02:10:43.268 --> 02:10:44.403
FACILITIES KNOWLEDGEABLE COACHES

02:10:44.469 --> 02:10:45.971
IN THE SCHOOL SUPPORT THEY WILL

02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:46.672
COME.

02:10:46.738 --> 02:10:48.173
BUT OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:49.174
ARE OFFERING FEWER SUPPORT

02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:50.943
PROGRAMS AND FEWER LEVELS OF

02:10:51.009 --> 02:10:52.344
SPORTS IN COMPARISON TO GIRLS.

02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:53.845
AND IN COMPARISON TO BOYS AND SO

02:10:53.912 --> 02:10:55.247
IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED BOYS ON

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:56.648
THE FOOTBALL PROGRAM.

02:10:56.715 --> 02:10:57.616
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF GIRLS

02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:58.917
THAT WANT TO PLAY VOLLEYBALL BUT

02:10:58.984 --> 02:11:01.053
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE TEAM OR TWO

02:11:01.119 --> 02:11:02.287
YOU COULD HAVE FIVE LEVELS OF

02:11:02.354 --> 02:11:03.488
VOLLEYBALL THESE DAYS YOU COULD

02:11:03.555 --> 02:11:05.023
HAVE THREE LEVELS OF STOP ALL

02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:06.191
THESE DAYS THE GIRLS WANT TO

02:11:06.258 --> 02:11:06.391
PLAY.

02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:09.928
BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:11.797
SCHOOL HAS TO BE BUILT.

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:13.232
SO AS MY COLLEAGUE RODGER BLAKE

02:11:13.298 --> 02:11:14.900
DISCUSSED WOULD WE EVER GIVE

02:11:14.967 --> 02:11:16.368
FEMALE STUDENTS FEWER DUSTIN

02:11:16.435 --> 02:11:18.070
BOYS IN THE CLASSROOM OR GIVE

02:11:18.136 --> 02:11:20.072
GIRLS OLDER BOOKS IN COMPARISON

02:11:20.138 --> 02:11:21.373
TO BOYS OR SIGN GIRLS TEACHERS

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:23.308
WHO DIDN'T KNOW MATH AS WELL AS

02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:24.576
TEACHERS WORKING WITH BOYS.

02:11:24.643 --> 02:11:25.877
WHY ARE WE DONE GIVING GIRLS

02:11:25.944 --> 02:11:27.846
FEWER ATHLETIC ROSTER SPOTS IN

02:11:27.913 --> 02:11:29.548
COMPARISON TO BOYS WHO HAVE AT

02:11:29.615 --> 02:11:31.183
LEASTA HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE

02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:33.218
SLOTS ON TEAMS IN CALIFORNIA?

02:11:33.285 --> 02:11:35.053
WHY ARE WE GIVING GIRLS OLDER

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:36.788
INFERIOR ATHLETIC UNIFORMS THAT

02:11:36.855 --> 02:11:38.323
THEIR SEWING THEMSELVES THE

02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:39.758
SOFTBALL PANTS WITH HOLES WHILE

02:11:39.825 --> 02:11:42.261
THE BOYS ARE GETTING SIX SETS OF

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:42.828
UNIFORMS IN THEIR BASEBALL

02:11:42.894 --> 02:11:45.097
PROGRAM? ONE OF THE MAIN CAMERA

02:11:45.163 --> 02:11:46.265
COLORS.

02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:47.733
AND WHY ARE WE GIVING BOYS MORE

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:49.001
EQUIPMENT AND NICER EQUIPMENT IN

02:11:49.067 --> 02:11:50.969
COMPARISON TO GIRLS TEAMS.

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:52.137
AND THEN FINALLY WIRE WE

02:11:52.204 --> 02:11:53.071
ASSIGNING GIRLS TEAMS COACHES

02:11:53.138 --> 02:11:54.439
WHO SOMETIMES HAVE NEVER EVEN

02:11:54.506 --> 02:11:56.541
PLAYED THE SPORT ON THE GIRLS

02:11:56.608 --> 02:11:57.943
TEAM WHERE IS BOYS COACHES ALL

02:11:58.010 --> 02:12:01.713
TOO OFTEN WERE ONCE

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.382
PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR GAME.

02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:04.049
AND TO ANYONE WHO SAYS WELL IT'S

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:05.117
THE BOOSTER CLUBS TIPPING THE

02:12:05.183 --> 02:12:05.651
SCALES WOULD WE EVER ALLOW

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:06.618
SOMEONE LIKE BILL GATES TO

02:12:06.685 --> 02:12:08.520
DONATE COMPUTERS JUST TO THE

02:12:08.587 --> 02:12:09.788
BOYS BUT NOT TO THE GIRLS.

02:12:09.855 --> 02:12:11.356
NO SO WE NEED TO STOP THE

02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:12.958
PRACTICE OF ALLOWING SCHOOLS AND

02:12:13.025 --> 02:12:14.626
WIDER COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT

02:12:14.693 --> 02:12:15.727
BOYS SPORTS OVER GIRLS SPORTS

02:12:15.794 --> 02:12:16.561
PERIOD.

02:12:16.628 --> 02:12:18.196
NO EXCEPTIONS.

02:12:18.263 --> 02:12:20.032
ATHLETICS IN SCHOOL IS ABOUT

02:12:20.098 --> 02:12:21.667
LEARNING AND GROWING AND EVERY

02:12:21.733 --> 02:12:23.168
STUDENT DESERVES THE SAME CHANCE

02:12:23.235 --> 02:12:24.836
TO PLAN FLOURISH REGARDLESS OF

02:12:24.903 --> 02:12:25.904
GENDER.

02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:27.105
FURTHER A SCHOOL'S ATHLETIC

02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:28.507
PROGRAM IS A MICROCOSM OF

02:12:28.573 --> 02:12:29.775
SOCIETY WHERE WE HAVE THE

02:12:29.841 --> 02:12:32.110
OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH GIRLS AND

02:12:32.177 --> 02:12:33.445
BOYS ABOUT GENDER EQUITY.

02:12:33.512 --> 02:12:35.013
WE MUST EXEMPLIFY EQUITY AND

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:36.581
FOSTER FAIRNESS THROUGHOUT

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:38.450
EDUCATION SO THAT THESE STUDENTS

02:12:38.517 --> 02:12:39.951
WILL GO INTO THE WORLD AND THE

02:12:40.018 --> 02:12:42.020
WORKPLACE HAVING LEARNED AND

02:12:42.087 --> 02:12:44.489
ABSORB THAT EQUITY IS THE LAW

02:12:44.556 --> 02:12:46.058
AND IT'S WHAT'S RIGHT FROM THE

02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:47.025
START.

02:12:47.092 --> 02:12:49.494
WHAT EXACTLY DOES EQUITY MATTER

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:54.933
IN ATHLETICS WHY ARE WELL FOR

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:55.867
ONE GIRLS WHO PLAY SPORTS ARE

02:12:55.934 --> 02:12:57.936
HEALTHIER PHYSICALLY MENTALLY

02:12:58.003 --> 02:12:59.604
AND THEY GRADUATED HIGHER RATES?

02:12:59.671 --> 02:13:01.239
BUT FEMALE ATHLETES WHO PLAYED

02:13:01.306 --> 02:13:03.642
IN HIGH SCHOOL GO ON TO EARN 7%

02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:05.077
HIGHER WE JUST AS ADULTS

02:13:05.143 --> 02:13:07.312
REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER THING OR

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:08.547
VARIABLE IN THEIR BACKGROUND.

02:13:08.613 --> 02:13:10.515
SO THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN FUNNY

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:12.784
GAMES IT'S A DOLLARS AND CENTS

02:13:12.851 --> 02:13:14.553
ESPECIALLY FOR GIRLS SEEKING

02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:16.254
ECONOMIC MOBILITY.

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:17.656
USING THE LESSONS AND

02:13:17.723 --> 02:13:18.357
EXPERIENCES THAT THEY LEARNED IN

02:13:18.423 --> 02:13:20.492

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:23.695
PAYCHECK.

02:13:23.762 --> 02:13:25.597

02:13:25.664 --> 02:13:27.632
EPIDEMIC PROBLEM OF INEQUITY IN

02:13:27.699 --> 02:13:29.768
