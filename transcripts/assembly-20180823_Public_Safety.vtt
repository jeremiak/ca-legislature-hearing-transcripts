REJECTED IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:53.671
COMMITTEE AND SO I MIGHT AS A

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:54.272
JUST A VERY VERY INTERESTING

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:54.906
THAT AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:55.940
SOME CLARIFYING.

00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:59.677
ANSWERS BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL --

00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:00.645
STUDY COMES OUT AFTER THE

00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:02.213
EXPIRATION DATE.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.082
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:05.917
THE STUDY COMES OUT AFTER

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:06.217
[inaudible]

00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:08.019
SO DID.

00:28:08.086 --> 00:28:09.354
I AM HOPING THAT WE GET

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.322
PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ON THE

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.956
STUDY.

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:13.491
FROM THE STUDY --

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:14.926
BEFORE TO FINALIZE SO WE'VE WE

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.394
DO HAVE TO MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:17.796
WE CAN'T.

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:20.031
SO RIGHT DOES COME OUT AFTER A

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:21.733
BUT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD HAVE

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.333
PRETTY GOOD INFORMATION BEFORE

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.402
THAT.

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:25.703
KILL MY IT WHY NOT.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.505
ACTUALLY MY FINAL QUESTION HAS

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:28.106
TO BE.

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.274
WITH THE FACT THAT ON THE THIRD

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.909
OFFENSE.

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:33.778
WHEN SOMEBODY HAS A A THEFT?

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:34.879
THEY'RE OFFERED DIVERSION ON THE

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:36.614
THIRD.

00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:38.283
OFFENSIVE SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD.

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:39.317
THE PENALTY SHOULD ESCALATE NOT

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:40.819
DIMINISH.

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:43.021
BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:28:43.088 --> 00:28:44.756
SO -- AND I

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:47.659
THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON ON ON

00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:49.027
ON THE CRIME AMIGA WITH THAT

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:49.894
WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH BAIL FOR

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:52.097
EXAMPLE --

00:28:52.163 --> 00:28:55.300
WE'RE PUTTING PRE TRIAL --

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:57.535
RISK ASSESSMENT AND SO THIS

00:28:57.602 --> 00:29:01.339
GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO JUST

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:01.873
SPECIFICALLY GO.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.641
WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE YOU

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:05.610
YOU GIVE PEOPLE SPECIAL PEOPLE

00:29:05.677 --> 00:29:07.512
WHO ARE ON DRUGS.

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.914
ALCOHOL PRIME AND DETONATE GIVEN

00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:11.483
AN OPPORTUNITY TO AFTER INTO

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:13.351
RETAIL THEFT AND YOU'RE STEALING

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:14.652
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DRUG OR

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:15.820
ALCOHOL PROBLEM.

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:18.823
WE GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO GET TO

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.758
PRE SUB COMPETITORS IN PROGRAMS

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:21.526
THAT CAN HELP THEM WITH%

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:24.295
ALCOHOLISM AS YOU KNOW PROBABLY

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:26.898
BETTER THAN I DO --

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:28.032
SOMETIMES FOR TO TAKE DOESN'T

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:29.767
TAKE ONE OR TWO TIMES.

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:31.803
CONTACT UNFORTUNATELY TAKE SEVEN

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:32.971
TIMES.

00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:34.906
INFO DISK ALLOWS THAT. TO BE --

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:39.010
PART OF THE OUR OUR PART OF THAT

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:40.445

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:49.087
SERVICES.

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:50.221
THAT'S STRATEGIES KINDA CONFUSED

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:51.623
WE HAVE IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD

00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:53.625
BE AT THE VERY FIRST OFFENSE

00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:55.093
