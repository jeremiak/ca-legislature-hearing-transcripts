WITH US SENATOR WIENER CENTER WINNER OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I WANT TO THANK THE- CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF- FOR THE STRONG ANALYSIS- ON THE BILL. OUR COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M PRESENTING SENATE BILL EIGHT SIXTY SIX- WHICH WILL- EMPOWER- TEENAGERS TO PROTECT THEIR OWN HEALTH- BY GETTING VACCINATED. SPECIFICALLY IT WILL ALLOW- PEOPLE ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AND OLDER- TO CONSENT TO VACCINATION. WHEN THE VACCINE WAS APPROVED BY THE U. S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND WHEN THE VACCINE MEETS THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES OF THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. SB SIX SEX IS NOT A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA IT BUILDS ON LONGSTANDING EXISTING. CALIFORNIA LAW ABOUT THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR RECEIVING HEALTH CARE. RIGHT NOW- THOSE TWELVE AND OLDER. CURRENTLY UNDER CURRENT LAW HAVE THE AUTONOMY TO MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. RIGHT NOW A TWELVE YEAR OLD TO OPEN UP- CAN CONSENT. TO RECEIVE THE HPV VACCINE. AS WELL AS A HEPATITIS B. VACCINE WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS CAN. RIGHT NOW. FIVE PEOPLE TWELVE AND OLDER CAN CONSENT TO MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL RELATED DISORDERS FOR INJURIES RELATING TO SEXUAL ASSAULTS OR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND FOR MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. BOB MINORS OF ANY AGE CAN CONSENT TO ACCESSING BIRTH CONTROL AND ABORTION- YET TEENS UNDER EIGHTEEN CANNOT CONSENT TO OTHER VACCINES. WHETHER IT'S THE FLU SHOT THE CODE BAXEEN FOR THE MUSICALS- MAXIMUM. EVEN IF A TEENAGER DESPERATELY WANTS A VACCINE AND NEEDS A VACCINE FOR EXAMPLE IF THAT TEENAGERS AT HIGH RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE WITHOUT VACCINATION- I EVEN IF IT'S NOT BEING VACCINATED PREVENTS THE TEAM. FROM PLAYING SPORTS OR BEING IN BANDS FOR HAVING A JOB THAT THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT OR BEING ABLE TO GO OVER THEIR BEST FRIEND'S HOME. THEY STILL CANNOT BE VACCINATED UNLESS THEIR PARENT CONSENTS. BY CONTRAST ON VARIOUS STATE TO ALLOW TEENAGERS TO GET VACCINATED ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT. FOR EXAMPLE IN RHODE ISLAND'S IN SOUTH CAROLINA IN OREGON AND ALABAMA AND WASHINGTON DC. IN THE CITY OF AGE OF CONSENT IS ELEVEN. DESPITE INCREDIBLE ADVANCES IN MEDICAL TREATMENTS AND VACCINES- DEADLY DISEASES PREVENTABLE DISEASES LIKE MEASLES WHICH WERE ONE TIME CONSIDERED ELIMINATED IN THE U. S. CONTINUE TO BE REINTRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO RISING VACCINE HESITANCY AND MISINFORMATION. MEASLES FOR EXAMPLE SPREADS EFFICIENTLY AMONG BACKS ON VACCINATED USED INCLUDING THOSE WHOSE PARENTS HAVE CHOSEN TO BLOCK THEM FROM RECEIVING THIS POTENTIALLY LIFESAVING VACCINE. BAXEEN MISINFORMATION HESITANCY HAS ALSO LED TO TRAGIC OUTCOMES DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. BUT EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE PARENTS DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR KIDS GETTING VACCINATED IS AND THIS GOAL IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE SITUATION WHERE A PARENT. IS AGAINST VACCINES ARE REFUSING WE KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY MEDICAL NEGLECT OF CHILDREN IS REAL THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY FAMILIES WHERE THE PARENTS ARE SIMPLY NEGLECTING THE MEDICAL CARE OF THEIR CHILD THEY'RE NOT AGAINST VACCINES ARE JUST NEGLECTING WAR. SITUATIONS WHERE PARENTS SIMPLY CAN'T MAKE THE TIME. TO TAKE THEIR KIDS TO BE VACCINATED THEY'RE WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS IT'S JUST NOT. THEIR HIGHEST PRIORITY COMPARED TO EVERYTHING ELSE I HAVE GOING ON IN LIFE. AND SO THE KID MAY NOT GET BACK SENATE. WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A DELAY OF SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THEY'RE VACCINATED WHICH CAN HAVE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES. WE KNOW THAT SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION CONFIRMED CASES OF CODE. AT ALMOST NINETY THOUSAND DEATHS NINETY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE DIED. BOB SINCE DATA DEMONSTRATES AN UNVACCINATED PEOPLE ARE STILL ALMOST NINE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM CODED THAN PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE THE ROOSTER DOES. NEARLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA TEENAGERS ARE UNVACCINATED FOR COVERT HAVING A LARGE NUMBER OF UNVACCINATED TEENS UNDERMINES PUBLIC HEALTH AND INCREASES THE RISK OF INFECTION HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH FOR THOSE KIDS BUT ALSO FOR OTHERS AROUND THEM. THESE LOW VACCINATION RATES KIND OF DIRE CONSEQUENCES A RECENT STUDY OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE YOUTH BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND SEVENTEEN PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE FOUND THAT ALMOST ALL TEENAGERS WHO NEED INTENSIVE CARE FOR COVER NINETEEN WERE UNVACCINATED AND ALL SEVEN WHO DIED. WERE UNVACCINATED. THIS HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS ARE PREVENTABLE TO ADD TO BE CLEAR. THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY ABOUT CODE THE CODE BAXEEN ABOUT OTHER VACCINES AS WELL BUT WE KNOW THE COVE IT IS FRONT AND CENTER STILL BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC IS NOT OVER- AND WALLS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS STILL EMERGING- REGARDING THE IMPACTS OF COOKING NINETEEN RELATED SCHOOL CLOSURES ON YOUTH. MOST STUDIES HAVE FOUND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THESE CLOSURES ON TEAMS MENTAL HEALTH ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT THANK LAST BASED ACADEMIC DISPARITIES AND VACCINATION IS ONE METHOD OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS DO NOT CLOSE DOWN. EMPOWERING YOUNG-PEOPLE WITH THE AUTONOMY TO RECEIVE LIFE SAVING VACCINES REGARDLESS OF THEIR PARENTS BELIEFS OR WORK SCHEDULES IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEPING STUDENTS IN SCHOOL AND FOR THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB EIGHT SIXTY SIX. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY- ON IT'S A GLOSSY ON- WHO'S AND- WITH TEENS FOR VACCINES- ARE IN PARSA THE FOUNDER OF TEENS FOR VACCINES. GEORGE SOROS- AND AN ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND DEEMED ON BURKE- AND I'M THE- UC DAVIS PEDIATRICIAN AND BOARD MEMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION COALITION AND WE ALSO HAVE PEOPLE AVAILABLE IF TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ARISE. OVER THE COURSE OF THE HEARING THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- IF THERE ARE THOSE WITH AS OF THE PRESENT HERE IN THE HEARING OF THAT APPROACH THE MICROPHONE IF NOT- MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD QUEUE UP- BONTA. KAILAS IN IRAN PARSA GEORGE SOROS- AND DR DEAN BLOOMBERG. ALL RIGHT HERE- IF YOU APPROACH THE MICROPHONE I WILL- YOU'VE GOT TWENTY MINUTES IN TOTAL IN SUPPORT I WILL ANNOUNCE EVERY FIVE MINUTE INTERVAL ALL RIGHT THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ONLY TWO BLOCKS YEAH I'M A PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATE FROM LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA AN AMBASSADOR FOR TEENS ACCEDES THE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS UNDER EIGHTEEN. YET THOSE UNDER EIGHTEEN MAKE UP 44% OF THE VACCINE WITHIN OUR STATE I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE OVER ONE MILLION UNVACCINATED TEENS IN CA. WHO CAN'T RECEIVE IMMUNIZATION DO BERRIES YOU CAN ALLEVIATE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WHY SB EIGHT SIX SIX WILL HELP OVER A MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE AND SAY THEY HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR BODY. TO GET BACKSEAT AND KEEP THEIR COMMUNITY SAFE. I STARTED MY JOURNEY IN VACCINE ADVOCACY AFTER MY MOM REFUSED TO LET ME GET BACK IN WITH THE FLU SHOT. WHAT COMPANY BURKE OUT AYE THAR LEASES TIRELESSLY URGE MY MOTHER TO LET ME GET BACK NEEDED EVEN CREATING SUCH A PRESENTATIONS. EVERY WEEK WITH NEW DATA SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS VACCINE. OVERTIME I SEE THE SLIDE SHOW WITH OVER TWO THOUSAND OTHER USE WHO ALSO HAD VACCINE HESITANT PARENTS. THIS ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TO REPERCUSSIONS MISINFORMATION HAD ON RELAX. WE KNOW VACCINES SAVE LIVES BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO VACCINATE MYSELF I LOST MY JOB. THREE INTERNSHIP AND WAS UNABLE TO SEE MY GRANDMA WHEN SHE WAS INTUBATED. SOME STUDENTS OR EVEN FORCE TO TAKE A GAP YEAR FROM THEIR UNIVERSITY DUE TO THEIR PARENTS NOT ALLOWING THEM TO GET IMMUNIZED. FOR MONTHS I ISOLATE MYSELF IN MY ROOM ONLY TAKING ROUTINE WALKS TO NEARBY PARK WITH FEAR OF RISKING THE LIVES. OF MY HIGH RISK FAMILY MEMBERS. LIKE OTHER CA KIDS I'VE CONTINUED REMOTE LEARNING DUE TO LIVING WITH HIGH RISK FAMILY MEMBERS. MANY OVERLOOK THE STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY STUCK AT HOME DUE TO SCHOOLS NOT BEING SAFE FOR THEM. STUDENTS ARE MISSING OUT ON VITAL OPPORTUNITIES AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES. SIMPLY DUE TO THE POLLING I THINK ISSUE THAT IS VACCINATION. WE MUST NOT LET TEENAGERS BE OPPRESSED ANY LONGER. DO NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE CHOICE. CALIFORNIA CAN BECOME A MORE EQUITABLE PLACE. BY MAKING MUSICIAN READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS TO SIT AGAIN MISTER THEM WITHOUT THE WORRY OF BACKLASH FROM PARENTS. STUDENTS SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT IMPACT THEIR LIVES SO HAPPILY. I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE STUDENT WAS A GRAMMAR WITH LUNG CANCER AT HOME. THE STUDENTS WHO MAY BE HIGH RISK THEMSELVES THE CENTER UNABLE TO. ATTEND SCHOOL. ALIENATED FROM THE WORLD TO SIMPLY DO THEIR VACCINATION STATUS. WE MUST GIVE OUR TEAMS THE RIGHT TO SAVE THEIR LIVES AND OTHERS BY ALLOWING. THEMSELVES TO CONSENT TO THEIR OWN IMMUNIZATION. CALIFORNIA'S MAY THE CHANGE. SOME OTHER STATES HAVE ACCEPT THE- MADE BEFORE THAT. AND THAT'S- EIGHT SIX. BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS. AS THE EIGHT SIX SIX GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE IT THEMSELVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHTS ARE AND PARCEL. TRYING TO TAKE THIS OFF. SURE THREE OF GOOD MORNING AS HE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ARGHA PARSA AND I AM A NINTH GRADER FROM SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA AND I'M THE FOUNDER OF TEENS VACCINES USED ORGANIZATION WITH AMBASSADORS WITH ACROSS MANY SEATS IN THE IN THE U. S. ALONE THE LIFESAVING POWER OF VACCINES AND EMPOWERING TEENS TO GET VACCINATED. I'M HERE TODAY TO VOICE MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB EIGHT SIX SIX SO YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE ME TWELVE AND OLDER. CONSENSUSDOCS NATIONS SO WE CAN LIVE WITHOUT THE FEAR ALL DEADLY DISEASES TAKING AWAY OUR FUTURES TWENTY NINETEEN DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE MEASLES OUTBREAKS% OF THAT YEAR WHEN MANY DISTRAUGHT TEENS OUT BACK AND HAS BEEN AN ANTI VAX PARENTS WERE GOING TO READ IT AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. TO KNOW HOW TO GET VACCINES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. DURING THIS TIME BROKE BALK A TEN YEAR OLD IN ORANGE COUNTY. COULD GET VACCINATED DUE TO HAVING A HEART TRANSPLANT. BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE PARENTS BECAUSE MIDDLE VACCINATION RATES WERE SO LOW IN ORANGE COUNTY DUE TO SOME PARENTS REFUSING TO GET THEIR CHILDREN VACCINATED. WHEN READING OF THE STORY WAS SHOCKING AND GUT WRENCHING TO ME THAT CHILDREN TODAY FACE THE SAME. DISEASES THAT PLAGUE US FIFTY AND EVEN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND EVER SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN TIRELESSLY ADVOCATING FOR EVERY CHILD'S RIGHT. TO GET VACCINATED AGAINST DEADLY DISEASES. WITH A CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC RAVAGING OUR COMMUNITIES FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW. WITH UNPREDICTABLE MUTATIONS OF THE VIRUS IN THIS INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA SWING PARENTS THE CRISIS FACED BY BACKING HAS BY. ALL BACKING HAS BEEN AN ANTI VAX PARENTS HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE. WHEN TEENS CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES THE LIVE IN FEAR AND ISOLATION WORRIED ABOUT CATCHING THE DISEASE MISSING SCHOOL INFECTING FRIENDS FOLDABLE GRANDPARENTS OUR YOUNGER SIBLINGS. THIS IS NOT ONLY A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE IT IS A SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS FOR TEENS THAT WE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO IGNORE ANY LONGER. WHAT WOULD IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED SIGNIFICANT INEQUITIES. SO MANY TEAMS HAVE PARENTS WHO ARE WORKING TWO JOBS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THE NECESSARY TRANSPORTATION TO GET VACCINATED TEENS NEED EASY ACCESS TO VACCINES. NOT ONLY IN SCHOOLS BUT ALSO AFTER COLLECTIVITY CENTERS AND PHARMACIES EVERY YEAR WE LOOK SO MANY HEALTHY TEENS TO FLU AND MENINGITIS. IT SHOULD BE EASY PREVENTABLE CANCER BUT OUR RATES HERE IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AND LOW INCOME. COUNTIES ARE BLESSING 20% LOWER CLOSE TO THE COAL WOULD CONTINUE TO THREATEN THE LIVES AND FUTURES. WE CANNOT IGNORE THESE INEQUITIES ANYMORE IT IS TIME WE TAKE ACTION IT'S TIME WE'RE WE REMOVE BARRIERS FOR ALL TEENS GET LIFESAVING VACCINES AND HEALTH CARE. EXISTING CALIFORNIA POLICY ALREADY ALLOWS MINORS TWELVE AND OLDER THE CONTENT OF TO PREVENTATIVE MEDICAL CARE. IN THE FORM OF VACCIES FOR HIV AND HEPATITIS B. WE MUST EXTEND THESE RIGHTS TO. STOP THE- WE MUST EXTEND THESE RIGHTS TO ALL IMMUNIZATIONS WITH TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE SHOWN IN THE PAST THAT WE CAN FORGE THE PATH AND SET AN EXAMPLE. IT'S TIME TO PASS THE SB EIGHT SIXTY SIX THE TEENS TO STOCK SEEMS ACT THIRTEEN CAN LIVE HAPPY AND HEALTHY LIVES WITHOUT THE THREAT OF DISEASE WHAT DO THE RIGHT THING THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT BOB MISTER GEORGE SOROS. YEAH. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS GEORGE SOURIS WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I'M LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE I'M HERE REPRESENTING OUR NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND PHYSICIAN MEMBERS. AT FIRST LIKE TO THANK CENTER WINNER DR PAN FOR BRING THIS TIMELY MEASURE FORWARD. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED COMMITTEE STAFF AND EVERYONE WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS BILL. CMA IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED EXISTING LAW ALLOWS FOR MINOR TWELVE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER TO MAKE CERTAIN MEDICAL DECISION WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT MOST NOTABLY AS IT RELATES TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. THIS PRESIDENT WAS FIRMLY UPTOWN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER ATKINS AUTHORED IMPASSE ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR NINE NINE WHICH ALLOW FOR ALL. FOR MINOR TWELVE YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER TO CONSENT TO MEDICAL CARE RELATED TO PREVENTION OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE- MOST NOTABLY INCLUDING THE HPV VACCINE. THIS MEASURE WAS LATER SIGNED BY THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. SB EIGHT SIX SIX SIMPLY EXPANDS AT A TINY TO FDA APPROVED VACCINES. IT IS A PRIORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION THE FOCUS ON UNIVERSAL ADOLESCENT IMMUNIZATION. THIS BILL IS A KEY COMPONENT IN ENSURING MINORS AGED TWELVE AND OLDER ARE GIVEN THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST HARMFUL DISEASE REGARDLESS OF PERSONAL BARRIERS THAT ARE PRESENTED. VACCINES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR USE AND ENSURE SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE CAN SAFELY NAVIGATE THE ONGOING BATTLES KOPEN NINETEEN OR ANY OTHER LIFE THREATENING DISEASE. WE MAY BE FACED WITH IN THE FUTURE. OUR POSITIONS AT CMA SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME DELIBERATING THIS LEGISLATION. AND ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO BE IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT. I CAN ASSURE YOU THE PHYSICIANS HAVE A DUTY TO ALWAYS HAVE THE PATIENT'S BEST HEALTH OUTCOMES. SB SIX EXCUSE PHYSICIANS THE OPTION TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT VACCINATION WITH THE PATIENTS WHO ARE TWELVE YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER. THIS IS NOT A MANDATE. MINORS AGED TWELVE AND OLDER HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE THIS DECISION WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TODAY TO GIVE THOSE INDIVIDUALS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. SENATORS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT VOTE NO WE DON'T TAKE THAT LIGHTLY BUT PLEASE CHOOSE A SIDE OF SCIENCE EQUITY AND CHOICE OUR COUNTRY IS LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER ON THESE ISSUES AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY MAKE A STATEMENT OF THIS LEGISLATION. ESPECIALLY URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE. EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BLOOMBERG. HAS CENTER- BURKE ANOTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR DEAN BLOMBERG I'M A SPECIALIST IN PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I'M PLEASED TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. EIGHT SIX SIX ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION COALITION A NONPROFIT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING AND MAINTAINING FULL IMMUNIZATION PROTECTION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND PREVENT SERIOUS ILLNESS DISABILITY AND DEATH. ALL VACCINES APPROVED BY THE FDA AND ROUTINELY RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN BY THE CDC ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS THE BENEFITS OF ALL ROUTINELY RECOMMENDED VACCINES FAR OUTWEIGH THE SIDE EFFECTS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VACCINES ARE ASTOUNDING THE NUMBER OF MEASLES CASES IN THE U. S. HAS DROPPED BY NINETY NINE POINT 99% DUE TO IMMUNIZATION. AND SIMILARLY THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 99% DECREASES IN CASES OF TETANUS GERMAN MEASLES AND SEVERE INFECTIONS LIKE MENINGITIS STUDENT HIM OR FROM OFFICE INFLUENZA TYPE B. SMALLPOX HAS BEEN ERADICATED FROM THE WORLD AND POLIO ERADICATED FROM THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. WORLDWIDE VACCINATION AS PREVENT AND THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DEATHS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND DID IT TEN VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE RELAPSE RELATIVE TO NO VACCINATION. THIS IS SAVING MORE THAN TWO MILLION DEATHS PER YEAR DISEASES ARE STILL AROUND AND THEY REMAIN A THREAT. IN MY PRACTICE UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE SEEN CHILDREN BRAIN DAMAGE DUE TO MENINGITIS WITH MEANING A CAUCUS OR LOSE AN ARM OR LEG DUE TO SEPSIS OR BLOOD POISONING. I'VE SEEN CHILDREN WITH SEVERE CASES OF INFLUENZA IN THE ICU ON VENTILATOR SO SOMETIMES ON HEART LUNG BYPASS MACHINES AND SOMETIMES DYING FROM THESE PREVENTABLE DISEASES BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IMMUNIZED. IN TERMS OF COVERT NINETEEN IN VACCINES MANY DO NOT REALIZE THAT COVERT NINETEEN CAN BE SERIOUS AND CHILDREN. TO DATE MORE THAN TWELVE MILLION CHILDREN HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH COVERT IN THE U. S. AND THIS IS RESULTED IN MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND HOSPITALIZATIONS. AND MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DEATHS IN TERMS OF THE AGE GROUP THAT pWE'RE TALKING TODAY SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DEATHS HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY THE CDC AND THE TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD AGE GROUP. I'VE TAKEN CARE OF MANY HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN WITH COVERT SOME IN THE ICU AND UNFORTUNATELY HAVE SEEN CHILDREN DIE FROM COVERT HERE AND CALIFORNIA. IMMUNIZATION RATES ARE SUBOPTIMAL DUE TO A VARIETY OF BARRIERS TO SELL ANY CHANGE THAT FACILITATES CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS WILL RESULT IN IMPROVED HEALTH AND WELLNESS FOR CHILDREN. TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILDREN ARE ALREADY ABLE TO CONSENT FOR HPV AND HEPATITIS B. VACCINES. THE ONLY LOGICAL TO EXTEND THIS CONSENT TO OTHER LIFESAVING VACCINES SUCH AS THE MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS VACCINE. UNFORTUNATELY COVERT ACTION NATION RATES FOR CHILDREN SIGNIFICANTLY LAG BEHIND OTHER AGE GROUPS WITH LESS THAN 60% OF TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS. RECEIVING TWO DOSES OF CODE VACCINE. THIS IS A REAL TRAGEDY SINCE THE CDC REPORTS THAT UNVACCINATED PEOPLE TWELVE YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER HAVE A TWENTY TIMES INCREASED RISK OF DYING FROM COVERT COMPARED TO THOSE WHO ARE VACCINATED. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S CRITICAL THAT CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION POLICY MAXIMIZES OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION INCLUDING ALLOWING CHILDREN TWELVE AND OVER TO CONSENT FOR THESE POTENTIALLY LIFESAVING PREVENTATIVE MEASURES. I'M CONFIDENT THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WILL APPROPRIATELY INFORM PATIENTS ABOUT VACCINES WHEN THEY OBTAIN CONSENT. AND PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE APPROVED VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT TO THE VACCINE RECIPIENTS. ROUTINELY RECOMMENDED VACCINES ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE THEY KEEP CHILDREN HEALTHY AND THEY SAVE LIVES. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION COALITION ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR S. B. EIGHT SIX SIX. TO FACILITATE CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION FOR HELP YOUR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND THE GROUND RULES OF THE PROPONENTS OF USED TWELVE MINUTES AND FORTY SECONDS- I MENTIONED THE OUTSET THAT THE OPPONENTS WITH EQUAL TIME HOWEVER ALSO SORT OF BE TWENTY MINUTES SO WE'LL GO AHEAD.

THAT NO MINOR CAN FILE A CLAIM AND THAT FOR THE TWELVE YEAR OLDS THIRTY YEAR OLDS FOURTEEN YEAR OLD AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS. WHO WILL NEVER REACH THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN THE THREE YEARS STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS TO FILE A CLAIM WITH A COMPENSATION FUND. THOSE INDIVIDUALS THOSE CHILDREN WILL BE LEFT HIGH AND DRY WITH ZERO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IF THEY EVER RECEIVE A VACCINE ANY VACCINE. AND HAVE ANY NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS. THIS THIS HARM THIS DANGER IS COMPOUNDED BY SENATE BILLS THANK A SENATE BILL FOURTEEN NINETEEN WHICH IS ALSO BEING CONSIDERED. BY THE SENATE CURRENTLY IN THIS SESSION WHICH WOULD SEAL THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF MINORS WHO ARE ABLE TO CONSENT TO MEDICAL PROCEDURES. SO NOW WE WOULD HAVE YOUR PARENTS REMOVED FROM THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO GIVE YOU THE VACCINE. WOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO SEAL YOUR RECORDS YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A VACCINE WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. AND THEN IF AND WHEN YOU IF GOD FORBID YOU HAVE A MEDICAL REACTION. THEY WOULD CALL YOUR DOCTOR. AND THEY WOULD ASK THEM. SOMETHING'S GOING ON I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING SHE'S HAVING A RASH IS HAVING A HARD TIME BREATHING HER HEART HURTS WILL EXPLAIN THE KIND OF COMPLICATIONS HERE WITH MY CLIENT MARABLE DUARTE.

THAT WE GIVE YOU WATCHING YOU DAY IN DAY NIGHT. WHAT YOU PUT ON YOUR BODY WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY WHAT EXERCISE YOU DO OR YOU DON'T DO. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. I UNDERSTAND SENATOR WIENER'S CONCERNS. IS NOT TO REMOVE THE PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN. WHO IS THE ONLY PERSON. THAT HAS ANY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE. ABOUT THESE CHILDREN'S. TWELVE AT THE VERY BEST. TWELVE YEARS OF MEDICAL HISTORY. THERE ARE MANY SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM. AND IS NOT REMOVING THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS KNOWLEDGE TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN EXCUSE ME ACTUALLY TO MAKE.

I FEEL BAD IN THAT AGE SIX STILL DON'T HAVE THAT MENTALITY OR THAT RIGHT NOW IS TO CHOOSE. IF THEY'RE OKAY OR HEALTHY ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT DECISION. I AM BEGGING YOU NOT TO LET THIS. THE BILL PASSED IN HEARD MORE CHILDREN THE WAY MINE HAS HURT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER WARD DAY ALL RIGHT- NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MIKE IS RIGHT HERE. FOR THANK YOU. GOOD% MORNING MR SHARED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATTHEW MCREYNOLDS HERE SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE A CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY JUST A FEW QUICK POINTS PRIMARILY ADDRESSED TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE CAME OUT YESTERDAY THE SIMPSON REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS THAT NEED TO BE DRAWN FIRST OF ALL AS TO THIS NOTION THAT WE'RE BUILDING ON EXISTING LAW. LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES SB EIGHT SIXTY SIX WHATEVER ELSE YOU MIGHT THINK OR SAY ABOUT IT IS NOT ABOUT EXPANDING CHOICE IT IS NOT ABOUT INFORMED CONSENT AND HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT FIRST OF ALL BY LOOKING AT ONE OF THE KEY DECISIONS IN THIS AREA THAT THE ANALYSIS FOCUSED ON AND WE BROUGHT UP IN OUR OPPOSITION LETTER AS WELL THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS VERSES LUNDGREN DECISION. AND WHAT THAT OTHER LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED DID. WAS EXPAND TRUE CHOICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN AREAS SUCH AS VACCINES AND MEDICAL CARE. WELL THANKS TO THE COMPULSORY. SCHOOL ATTENDANCE LAWS SB EIGHT SIXTY SIX WILL ENSURE WE FOR ALLUSIONS TO THIS FROM. THE OTHER SIDE TODAY THAT THERE IS NO REAL CHOICE THE STUDENTS ARE GIVEN AS THE VACCINES. IF YOU WANT TO TRULY GIVE KIDS A CHOICE GIVEN THE CHOICE. GIVE THEM A CHOICE TO ATTEND SCHOOL WITH OR WITHOUT A VACCINE. THAT'S INFORMED CONSENT AND THAT'S TRUE CHOICE. SO A LOT MORE COULD BE SAID ABOUT THE AMERICAN ACADEMY DECISION AS WELL AS THE- THE BOOTH DECISION FROM DC WHICH JUST RECENTLY STRUCK DOWN. A VERY SIMILAR MEASURE UNFORTUNATELY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AT RESORTS TO IGNORING MOST OF THE ISSUES IN THAT CASE AS WELL AS PYRIDINE THE LOSING. ARGUMENTS BUT I FIND IT VERY TELLING THAT THE FEDERAL JUDGE THERE- ACTUALLY ECHOED MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD- BY IN POINT YOU FOR TODAY AS WELL AS IN THE- OPPOSITION STATEMENTS WEB URGE YOU TO TAKE. A MUCH MUCH CLOSER LOOK AT NOT ONLY THE DEC'S DECISION BUT AND DECISION THE CANNOT JUST LAST WEEK FROM THE KANSAS CITY AREA- THE HOLDING. THIRTY CASE COULD GO FORWARD AGAINST WALMART FOR AT VACCINATING AS TO FIGHT CHILD. WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS CONSENT. A ACCOUNT OF THOSE THAT YOU JUST IT FEW OTHER QUICK POINTS. THE COMEDIAN ALICE NO. THAT THAT PARENTS ARE. OPPOSING VACCINES OR VACCINE HESITANT BECAUSE THEY'RE SUFFERING FROM MISINFORMATION THERE UNDER RESOURCE AND THEY'RE OVER BIRD. PERRANCE HERE ARE PLAGUED BY MISINFORMATION THE PLAGUE BIKE MISSING INFORMATION SUCH AS THE MISSING INFORMATION ON ACTUAL VACCINE STATS NOT ABOUT THE ENTIRE POPULATION AS YOU SEE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ELSEWHERE IN THE DEBATE BUT SPECIFIC TO KIDS ABOUT THE DATA FROM THE CDPH ITSELF. FROM THE VACCINE ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING SYSTEM WITH THE HHS ON ALL OF THE ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED THOUSANDS OF THEM- BY KIDS TAKING A SERIOUS- SERIOUS EFFECTS HOSPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER MAJOR MAJOR EFFECTS THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM GETTING VACCINES. IF YOU WANT TRUE INFORMED CHOICE INFORMED CONSENT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THAT PART OF THE DEBATE AND IS COMPLETELY MISSING SO SOME MISINFORMATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MISSING INFORMATION. AS FAR AS BEING. OVER BURDENED. IT'S ARE OVERBURDENED FOR SURE THERE- OVERBURDENED BY THIS BODY AT CONTINUING TO TAKE AWAY THEIR RIGHTS CONTINUING TO LOAD THEM DOWN WITH THE REGULATIONS LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS LISTEN TO A HEARTFELT TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE WE'VE JUST HEARD. PLEASE DON'T TAKE US BACK A HUNDRED YEARS WHICH IS WHERE WE STARTED WITH THE COMPULSORY VACCINE- DECISIONS. PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF PROGRESS THAT HAVEBEEN MADE WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS SINCE THIS IS A DECISION IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THE- PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE FOR PARENTAL RIGHTS FOR FREE EXERCISE RIGHTS EVEN FOR STUDENTS RIGHTS IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT ROUND. ALL OF THAT IS AT RISK IF WE GO BACK A HUNDRED YEARS IN REVERT TO THE DISCREDITED POLICIES OF A BY GONE ERA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MCREYNOLDS ALL RIGHT- ONE LAST WITNESS. TO HOW MUCH TIME IS UP YOU USE FORTY MINUTES AND TWENTY ONE SECONDS GO AHEAD. SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY TESTIMONY TODAY MY NAME IS SABRINA SOUND OF ALL I AM A PRACTICING SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST THE SEVEN YEARS. MY WHOLE LIFE AND CAREER REVOLVES AROUND BEING A RESOURCE TO CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THAT ROLE I SSL CHILDREN'S COGNITIVE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND ADAPTIVE LEVELS OF FUNCTIONING IMPACTS THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN AND FUNCTION AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING. I'M HERE TODAY TO GIVE MY PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT AS TO WHY SB EIGHT SIX SIX IS NOT SOUND POLICY MY TWO GREATEST CONCERNS FROM A PSYCHOLOGY PERSPECTIVE RELATE TO TEENS DECISION MAKING INTO CHRISTIAN. SB EIGHT SIX SIX PUTS THE RESPONSIBILITY ON MINORS OF AGE TWELVE YEARS OR OLDER TO MAKE POTENTIALLY LIFE ALTERING MEDICAL DECISIONS WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME OPENING THEM UP TO POSSIBLE CREATION BALLING IMPAIR PRESSURE THIS BILL IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER IN CALIFORNIA IN SPITE OF CLAIMS THAT WE HAVE PRESIDENT WITH HPV ARE HAPPY VACCINES. EXPANDING MINOR CONSENT TO ALL FDA APPROVED VACCINES ESPECIALLY TO COVET NINETEEN VACCINES EXPOSES TEENS TO MEDICAL CONVERSION THROUGH INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND FOOD BASED REWARDS IF THE TEAMS ARE TWELVE YEAR OLD BRAIN DEVELOPMENTALLY CLIP TO MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS THERE ARE THREE AREAS OF THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISION MAKING FIRST IS THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX WHICH IS THE PRIMARY AREA OF THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR RATIONAL DECISIONS. AND FOR PROCESSING RIGHT FROM WRONG AND BOTH LONG AND SHORT TERM CAUSE AND EFFECT A FRIEND FACT THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX IS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED UNTIL ABOUT AGE TWENTY FIVE SECOND IS THE MAKE DELAY WHICH IS IMPULSIVE PART OF THE BRAIN AND DECISION MAKING IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INSTINCTIVE REACTIONS SUCH AS FIGHT OR FLIGHT. AND FOR STORING BOTH BAD AND HIGHLY REWARDING EXPERIENCES A FUN FACT TO THE MIDDLE A MIDDLE. IS ALREADY DEVELOPED AT BIRTH. THERE'S A STUDY DONE OUT OF MY LEAN HOW. BRAIN AND CENTER AND BOSS THAT CAN. TO BRAIN TO THOSE OF A DAHLE WHEN FACE EMAIL DEATH. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FULLY DEVELOPED ADULT BRAINS HAVE THE ABILITY TO OVERRIDE THE IMPULSIVENESS OF THEM MAKE TO LET BY USING THEIR PREFRONTAL CORTEX OR THE RATIONAL PART OF THE BRAIN. ADELIN SEN I'M SORRY ADOLESCENCE MOSTLY PROCESS INFORMATION WITH THE MAKE DELAY AND DO NOT FULLY HAVE THE COULD KEEP ABILITY TO OVERRIDE. THAT AREA WITH THE RATIONAL BRAIN THIS IS IMPORTANT WHEN CONSIDERING TEAMS MAKING MEDICAL DECISIONS. THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE FULLY DEVELOPED DECISION MAKING SKILLS NEEDED TO WEIGH THE RISKS AND BENEFITS. AND MAKING A TRULY INFORMED DECISION AS LOWER ACTIVITY IN THE FRONTAL LOBE CAN LEAD TO POOR JUDGMENT AND REACTIONARY DECISION MAKING MAKING. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY CONCERN OF COURSE ASIAN BALLING IMPAIR PRESSURE. WE NOW IN ORDER TO MAKE A WHILE WAITED OUT DECISION YOU NEED TO HAVE THE SKILLS BRAIN MECHANICS AND KNOWLEDGE BASE ARTICLES FOR THESE AND THEN THAT. IT HAS BEEN A WELL ESTABLISHED THAT ALL OF US AT ONE POINT ESPECIALLY CHILDREN WANT TO PLEASE AND OBEY THOSE IN AUTHORITY WHEN CHILDREN HEAR MESSAGES THAT THEY WILL GET SICK AND MY SKEPTICAL THAT VACCINE TO PROTECT GRAMMA. THEY ARE VERY IMPRESSIONABLE THE DESIRE TO GET THE COVERT VACCINE BY THE CHILD IS NOT BORNE OUT OF SINCERE DESIRE FOR THE VACCINE. BUT RATHER BECAUSE OF THE INTENSE GO HERE SEVEN BOWLING TACTICS TACTICS AT THAT AT THE READY. NEVER BEFORE WITH ANY VACCINE IN OUR LIFETIME HAVE WE SEEN THIS MEDICAL CONFUSION AND OUR CHILDREN ARE BEARING THE BRUNT OF IT. WELL THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS POINT OUT THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW MINORS AT AGE TWELVE YEARS AND OLDER MAY CONSENT TO MEDICAL CARE. RELATED TO THE PREVENTION OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE WHICH INCLUDED HPV OR HAPPY VACCINES SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY OFFERED INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. FOOD BASED REWARDS ARE POP UP CLINICS FOR VACCINES STUDENTS HAVE BEEN OFFERED PIZZA ICE CREAM AND OTHER ENTICING INCENTIVES IT SENSE IT AND SORRY INCENTIVES IF THEY COMPLY AND GET THE COVERT VACCINE. THE BILL IN DALLAS DESPITE OUT THAT THE AUTHOR MY AND THE BILL TO ADD. RAIL FOR TO MINORS. WHOSE ABILITY TO CAN. MY BE COPPER BE. DISABILITY ORGANIZATIONS I WORK WITH SEVERE US SERVE MINORS WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE CONSERVED AT THE AGE OF MAJORITY. DUE TO SEVERELY IMPACT TO FALL COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS. PERMITTING A MINOR WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES DISABILITIES TO CONSENT TO VACCINATION AND THE ABSENCE OF A PARENT OR GUARDIAN. RAISES ETHICAL CONCERNS AS WELL AS CONCERNS OVER INFORMED CONSENT. MINOR STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS HAVE NEVER BEFORE FACED THE POSSIBILITY OF MEDICAL CORPS HERE'S COURAGE AND- AN EXCHANGE FOR SHORT TERM INCENTIVES IN A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. ABSENT PARENTAL CONSENT AND REVIEW OF COMPLICATED MEDICAL HISTORIES VACCINATION OF SUCH CHILDREN COULD BE A DEVASTATING HEALTH IMPACT. IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION CHILDREN AGE TWELVE AND UP WHETHER NARAL TYPICAL OR WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS ARE NOT. PSYCHOLOGICALLY FULLY EQUIPPED TO MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS AND SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO MEDICAL CHRISTIAN. FOR THE REASONS STATED I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE ON SB EIGHT SIX SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SON OF ALL OF THE THOSE ARE THE FOUR WITNESSES I UNDERSTAND IS THE FIFTH WITNESS MISS RICHARDSON WHOSE- FLOWN HERE TO TESTIFY. SO MISS RICHARDSON- GO AHEAD- THERE'S NOW BEEN NINETY MINUTES AD THIRTY TWO SECONDS THAT HAVE. BEEN USE GO AHEAD AND TAKE THREE MINUTES AND THAT WILL THEN EXHAUSTS THE FIVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SO MUCH I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S DON RICHARDSON THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY FROM THE NATIONAL VACCINE INFORMATION CENTER HERE TO VOICE OPPOSITION WARNER FORTY APPEARED IN THE ICY AND WE ARE MISSION BASE TO PROTECT INFORMED CONSENT TO VACCINATION. I'M NOT GONNA TRYING GO THROUGH THINGS REALLY QUICK IN THE OFFICE SCRIPT HERE TO JUST GIVE YOU THE PERTINENT INFORMATION. THAT HASN'T BEEN COVERED BEFORE YOUR KIDS ARE DEFINITELY VULNERABLE TO PEER PRESSURE THE CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST MENTION THAT BUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF THIS PASSES HIS KIDS ARE GONNA BE TARGETED AND MARKETED TO GET THE VACCINES. AND THIS IS IN STARK CONTRAST TO LAWS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THAT PREVENT THE MARKETING AND SELLING OF RISK CONTAINING PRODUCTS TO KIDS LIKE TOBACCO VAPING MATERIALS PREPAID BB GUNS ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES EVEN TATTOOS WHICH ARE STILL INJECTED BUT THEY'RE JUST DIES. KIDS CAN'T GET THEM AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE CHILDREN WHO TESTIFIED TODAY THEY HAVE BEEN BLESSED NOT TO AS A PARENT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE VACCINE REACTION SO IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THEY GET EXCITED WHEN THEY SEE TO TALK VIDEOS AND SNAPCHATS ABOUT. HEY LET'S GET OUR VACCINES BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE DEALING WITH A CHILD WITH LONGTIME DISABILITY THAT CONGRESS AFFIRMED THROUGH THE NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY ACT. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT CENTER WIENER ON THE WEBSITE WHEN HE'S PROMOTING THE BILL HE IS BRINGING UP SOME STATES AS EXAMPLES BUT WHAT HE DOES NOT DISCLOSE TO YOU IS THAT FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THE STATES THAT HE BRINGS UP. THOSE LAWS WERE PASSED IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES REALLY TARGETED TOWARDS REPRODUCTIVE AN EMERGENCY ROOM HEALTH THINKING NEVER SPECIFICALLY. MENTIONED VACCINES AND AT THAT TIME THERE WERE ONLY THREE TAX ON THIS. NOW THEIR SUPPORT. THEY NEVER COME. THE SLIDE. AND THOSE FOR. THAT WOULD HAVE THIS BLUE. IN INFO. VACCINE SCHEDULE THROUGH. THE OTHER STATE THAT HE MENTIONS ARE NOT STATE LOCATIONS DC WAS ALREADY MENTIONED BY THE LAWYER FROM THE PACIFIC JSTICE INSTITUTE THOUGHT LAW WAS STRUCK DOWN BY FEDERAL COURT ALSO CONGRESS HE NEVER CONTEMPLATED. FOR CHILDREN TO BE MAKING THESE DECISIONS AT ALL AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT I RIGHT ON THE NATIONAL INJURY. ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WHEN IS PASSED IT STATE THAT BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATION VACCINES TO CHILD HEALTH CARE PROVIDER SHALL GIVE A COPY OF THE CDC'S VACCINE INFORMATION MATERIALS TO THE- PARENT OR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE. ANY CHILD TO WHOM THE PROVIDER INTENDS TO ADMINISTER SUCH A VACCINE ALSO ONE PC WEBSITE THE CONFIRM THIS IN THEIR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHERE DOES THE PARENT HAVE TO BE GIVEN THIS BEFORE VACCINATION. AND THE ANSWER IS A CLEAR YES THAT IS WHAT FEDERAL LAW HAS OUTLINES. ALSO CONVERSE DID HAVE TO CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS IN EARLY MARCH AND OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE ONLY SIDE REPRESENTED WAS THE TEAM'S SIDE NAY EVEN HAD A KID WHO COMPLAINED ON REDDIT THAT HIS MOM DIDN'T LET HIM GET VACCINATED. THE PROBLEM WAS THIS STARTED WITH MEDIA AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF LAWS BEING FILED IN TWENTY NINETEEN SEVEN STATES ELEVEN TWENTY TWENTY SIX STATES AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND NINE STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WITH THIS BODY HAS TO UNDERSTAND RECOGNIZE IS THAT THE STATES HAVE ALL CATEGORICALLY WAS REJECTED GO AHEAD. THESE PROVISIONS. SO I I'LL SAY THAT WE KNOW THESE KIDS THEIR TIME. BEING TOLD BY ADULTS WHO JUST SAYING TO DRUG. AND WHAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO IS ACTUALLY GOING AND KEEPING CURRENT RIGHT KIDS TO GO GET DRUGS. ARE ABOUT PERSONAL LIFE WITHOUT PER. THANK YOU FOR BY OKAY- NOW- WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION. OF FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED WHO WISH TO TESTIFY.

BASICALLY AFTER THEY'VE USED THEIR EIGHTY MINUTES TO RELINQUISH THEIR- PHONE LINE FOR THOSE IN SUPPORT THAT'S NOT BEEN DONE SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN HAVE TO CUT OFF THOSE IN SUPPORT. SO LET ME BRING IT BACK HERE TO THE COMMITTEE- QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATE YOUR QUESTIONS WHAT KELSEY SEMI CAL SKI THEN CENTERED. SENATE WINNER WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT- YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF- OF YOUTH IN ON PAGE NINE OF OUR STAFF REPORT THEY TALK ABOUT. I AM. EDUCATE EPIC ABOUT MINORS COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES ARE EVEN SOME CONDITIONS OF ANXIETY AND THE STAFF REPORT SUGGESTS THAT THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR GUARD RAILS TO BE ADDED CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT- SURE OF ANYTHING OR JUST REFER I DO IT FOR SOMEONE THE CHAIR- FROM THE BOTTOM MY HEART FOR PRESIDING OVER A CHALLENGER HEARING I ALSO JUST WANT EXPRESSED SERVE. OF THE BILL WHO WERE TRYING TO CALL AND I AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE TEARS APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT HAD NO OTHER CHOICE BECAUSE OF THE EXTREMELY ABUSIVE FOR PEOPLE KNOWING THAT THERE WAS AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES FROM POSITION CALLING HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR SUPPORT CALLING AND WANT TO GIVE EVERYONE EQUAL TIME AND THE OPPONENTS CLEARLY RANGING ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR BY TRYING TO DROWN OUT THE SUPPORTERS AND BY CALLING AND A SUPPORTERS AND I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS TO THE SUPPORTERS THAT WE HEAR YOU- AND WE APPRECIATE- EVERYONE SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION- AND IT'S JUST% UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME PEOPLE TRY TO DROWN OUT OTHER PEOPLE- BUT SEVERAL ACCOUNTS YOU TO ANSWER YOUR- QUESTION- JUST TO BE CLEAR. THAT THE IDEA OF INFORMED CONSENT FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR ANYONE WHETHER YOU ARE A TEENAGER OR WHETHER YOU'RE SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD IS NOT A NEW ONE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW OR UNDER- FIVE AT THE GOAL GUIDELINES FOR TREATMENT INFORMED CONSENT- IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS AND IT TO SOMEONE WHO WILL SAY WHETHER BECAUSE OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OR OR OTHER OR OR SOME SORT OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WHETHER THEY'RE FOURTEEN YEARS OLD OR WHETHER THEY'RE FIFTY YEARS OLD THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IN TERMS OF ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THEY HAVE TO TAKE. INTO ACCOUNT THAT IS NOT THAT IS NOTHING NEW- AGAIN FOR OTHER TEENAGER WHETHER YOU'RE OVER EIGHTEEN IN ADDITION- WE CALIFORNIA AND CAL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW FOR MANY MANY YEARS WE HAVE- ASPELL IT IS A CONCERN THAT IS LESS THAT IS LOWER THAN EIGHTEEN- AS I STATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STATE AND A VERY THOROUGH. ANALYSIS FOR THE FIRST TIME OF ACTION. FOR MONTHS HEALTH TREATMENT OTHER VARIOUS KIND OF. TREAT AGENT. IS AND THE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS A FOR. IN TO. THERE LIVING ON THEIR OWN FINANCIALLY SUPPORTING THEMSELVES. IT'S FIFTEEN MINUTES BUT NOT FOR A LONG A LONG TIME SO. THAT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING PROVIDER HAS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MATTER WHO THEY'RE TREATING IN WHAT CONTEXT. IS THIS PERSON CAPABLE OF. CONSENTING AND SO WITH THIS LAW DOES NOT. DEVIATE FROM THAT OR OR OR CHANGE THAT OR CHANGE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA HAS LONG ALLOWED TEENAGERS. TO OBTAIN CERTAIN KINDS OF TREATMENT INCLUDING CERTAIN KINDS OF VACCINES- WITHOUT SAID WE DID SEE THAT STATEMENT IN THE ANALYSIS AND WE ARE OF COURSE- ALWAYS OPEN THE GOING BACK AND LOOKING MAKING SURE. THAT EVERYTHING IS SOLID- BUT THAT'S. THAT'S MY RESPONSE. YES MISTER THROWING- SEVEN OPPOSITION SAYS THIS- THESE- NOTICES THAT CAME OUT TO AGO THIS. ON ITS- TO MAKE THIS. S. B. THE SIX SIX ACOSTA. STAFF ANALYSIS. INDICATED IT'S NOT SUCH A CLEAR CUT- DECISIONS FOR YOU. GAVE ME ABSOLUTELY AND- SO THAT RULING WAS ONE. LOWER COURT RULING BY ONE JUDGE. IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA- THAT IS- THAT PERSONAL IT DOESN'T APPLY TO CALIFORNIA NOT SOME SORT OF IT WAS ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC DC LAW BY ONE JUDGE IN THAT CAN BE APPEALED BUT I'M ASSUMING IT'S BEEN APPEALED- IN ADDITION IF YOU LOOK AT THE LOGIC OF THAT DECISION I AND I AGREE THAT WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. IT IS WRONG BUT JUDGE WAS JUST WRONG- AND THE RULING WAS SAT AND FEDERAL LAW NATIONAL NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT PREEMPTS LOCAL OR A STATEMENT OF FACT AT LEAST A LITTLE LAW THAT- LOWER THE AGE OF CONSENT. TO LOW EIGHTEEN- AND THAT THAT'S ON PRESS. STATES HAVE LAW. HAD THE A STAR FOREVER TO DETERMINE AGE OF CONSENT FOR ANY GIVEN TYPE OF HEALTH CARE AND STATES HAVE DONE CALIFORNIA HAS DONE IT. OTHER STATES HAVE DONE A LONG BEFORE THAT ACT WAS ENACTED SINCE THAT ACT WAS ENACTED AND THERE'S NO EXPRESS PREEMPTION IN THE FEDERAL LAW AND THERE'S NO CONFLICT AND SO- I RESPECT RESPECT TO THAT ONE LOWER COURT JUDGES IN DC- I DISAGREE- AND AGREE WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND- OF AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT BINDING. ON US SOMEONE TO FILE A LAWSUIT IF THIS IS PASSING THE LAW EVERY RIGHT TO DO THAT JUST LIKE TO DO WITH ANY LAW. AND ORDER AND JUST HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CLARIFY ARE WE REPLACING THE PARENTS RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS WITH THEIR FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH WITH THE STATE'S RIGHT TO. MAKE THESE DECISIONS NO THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE WILL MAKE THE DECISION THIS IS EMPOWERING THE TEENAGER TO MAKE THAT DECISION JUST LIKE WE- EMPOWER TEAMS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE CONTACTS. THE WHAT KELSEY SIR. THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M A CO FOR THE IN THEN I ALSO THAT WE LIKE A- IF I COULD- MR MCGREGOR QUESTION IF THAT WOULD BE OKAY SURE MISSING MAKING REYNOLDS I KNOW HE'S ROACH THE MICROPHONE THANK YOU THANK- THE SENATE LEADER ON I'VE- THE CMA HAD SOME. VERY COMPELLING- STATEMENTS THAT I AGREE WITH. BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE A PHYSICIAN'S THE TEENAGERS GOING TO SCHOOL AND CONSENTING TO THESE VACCINES COMPELS THE SCHOOL OR THE TEAM OR ANY ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKER TO CONSOLE WITH THAT. IN NATURE'S PEDIATRICIANS AT CORRECT. THIS LAW DOES NOT AFFECT WHAT HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ARE AUTHORIZED TO VACCINATE SOMEONE EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW. AUTHORIZES WHO COUNTING CANNOT ADMINISTER- THE PEOPLE AUTHORIZED TO ADMINISTER VACCINES. OR TRAINS THEY HAVE ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS THEY'RE BOUND BY CALIFORNIA LAW AND BY THEIR OWN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS. AND THIS WILL BE NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER SITUATION WHERE A TEENAGER UNDER CAL LAW AS LONG BEEN ABLE TO SEE POSITION OR WHATEVER. PROFESSIONALS AUTHOR TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE AND JUST AS CHANGE RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU IN THE REASON I BRING IT UP IS YOU KNOW MY FAMILY WE'VE WE'VE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PEDIATRICIAN AND YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT. CME'S ARE FROM POINT SOME DEGREE BUT I DO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE WITNESSES THAT- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LEADING WITNESSES THE SHARED. YOU KNOW THAT THEIR CHILD HAD- HEALTH CONDITION WHEN THEY WERE AN INFANT THAT THE SCHOOL OR YOUR A CURRENT HEALTHCARE PROVIDER WOULD NOT HAVE ANY OF THAT HISTORY. WITHOUT CONSTANT WITHOUT CONSOLING WITH THE CHILD'S PITTED SO IF THAT WAS THE ONE YOU KNOW ON THE GUARDRAILS IT WAS IN THE BILL- I THINK IT WOULD MOVE ME CLOSER- TO BEING LESS- ADVERSE TO THE- AND SO SWITCHING. I DIDN'T WANT TO ASSISTANCE MISTER MCREYNOLDS BROUGHT IT UP THE DC CASE. IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE IS SOME AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE AUTHOR TOOK TO DESCRIBE. THEIR SIDE OF MR MCCONNELL'S COULD KINDA EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THAT DC CASE PLEASE SIR- SIR JOHN SPECIFIC ROUTES OF YOU DIRECT YOUR COMMENTS TO THE CHAIR. IT CERTAINLY IS THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR INSIGHT IN YOUR ATTENTION THAT PARTICULAR CASE. I THINK THE SENATOR WIENER'S COMMENTS ARE ILLUMINATING THAT ESSENTIALLY. SB EIGHT SIXTY SIX JUST TAKES A DIFFERENT VIEW AND TAKES THE VIEW THAT THE- DECISION OUT OF THE DC COURT- WAS SIMPLY WRONG. EIGHT HE'S CORRECT IN THAT A DECISION FROM A LOWER FEDERAL COURT IN DC- IS NOT BINDING OR CONTROLLING ON THIS BODY. BUT IT CERTAINLY PRESENTS SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE READY- PERCEIVE A LOT OF AND ILLEGALITY WITHIN A S. S. B. EIGHT SIXTY SIX- IT LAYS OUT A- PRETTY EXTENSIVE. FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO ATTACK THIS BILL. AND GET TO SOME OF THAT GENERAL INTEREST POINTS EIGHT IN. OF COURSE THERE ARE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED IN DC COMMITTEE ANALYSIS PICKED UP ON THIS AS WELL. I OF COURSE THERE ARE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN S. B. EIGHT SIXTY SIX IN ALL OF THE OTHER STATE LAWS AND RECITED. IN SUPPORT OF IT IS- AUTHORIZING VARIOUS TYPES OF- HEALTH EMANCIPATION IF YOU WILL FOR MINORS AND OTHER STATES THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME DISTINCTIONS. BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT AND YOU KNOW WE KNOW AS LAWYERS WE ASK OURSELVES. ARE THESE DISTINCTIONS WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE. AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE ARE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE INSIDES OF THE FEDERAL JUDGE IN DC AND ECHOING THAT IS A LEADER TO EARLIER. OF SOME OF THE SAME KINDS OF CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED. IN THE OPPOSITION SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE FOR INSTANCE WHAT YOU HEARD FROM PARENTS AS WELL AS FROM OTHERS. ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF KIDS WHO DON'T KNOW THEIR OWN. MEDICAL HISTORY ESPECIALLY FROM A YOUNG AGE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COURT IN. DC PICKED UP ON. IT SO THE THING THAT I THE KEY THE COURTS HERE WOULD BE VERY. ATTUNED AND SO- I THINK THAT'S WHY THE DECISION FROM THE DC COURT WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE- ALL OF YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT YOU KNOW DECIDE FOR YOURSELVES WITH THE DISTINCTIONS ARE- AND WHAT THE SIMILARITIES ARE IN. I BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND MORE SIMILARITIES THAN DIFFERENCES. PARTY THANK YOU MISS MAKE ROUNDS. SENATE JONES AS THANK YOU RICHARD YEAH THAT'S ALL I HAD- I'M I'M HAVING A HARD TIME- SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- I'LL BE VOTING NO AND I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH KIND OF AN ANECDOTAL. ANYHOW COMMENT WHEN I REMEMBER I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY WE HAD A BILL AND- THAT WAS PROHIBITING. TEENS FROM GOING TO US SPRAY TAN SON BOOTH- WITHOUT PARENT TOOK CONSENT AND- I JUST THINK SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS ON THIS PARABLE CONSENT. BREAKS DOWN WHEN YOU LOOK AT. A SOME MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT VOTED FOR THAT BILL TO BAN. TEEN GIRLS FROM GOING TO GET A SUNTAN- BECAUSE HE CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION BUT WE'RE ALLOWING TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS. TO MAKE THE DECISION TO GET A VACCINE AND MEDICAL TREATMENT SELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR JONES OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS I DON'T- YES EARLIER THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SO THE DEBATE ON THE DC CASE HAS BEEN. ON THE WALL BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A LITTLE ABOUT THE ACTUAL. PROGRAM IS THERE EVIDENCE. THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED HERE. ARE CAME INTO PLAY IN DC WHEN THE AGE OF CONSENT WAS ELEVEN WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS IT CONSIDERED A SUCCESS WHAT WERE THE ISSUES. BUT I MEAN I. THE THAT WOULD BE A QUESTION FOR THE WASHINGTON DC OF A FALSE OR THAT'S WHAT I WAS SUGGESTING TO YOUR WAS GONNA YES WE- I'VE NOT HEARD OF ANY PROBLEMS- THERE- AND- WE CERTAINLY CAN ACQUIRE- WITH WATCHINGWHAT DC OFFICIALS BUT WE'VE NOT HEARD OF ANY FIVE ARE ARE OBVIOUSLY SUGGEST IF THERE'D BEEN PROBLEMS WE WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT IN THE LIKE THE TESTIMONY BUT IT STILL WAS A- MATTER. DURING THE OPINIONS OF PROBLEMS HERE TWENTY OPINIONS THEN THEN A SIMILAR QUESTION BECAUSE WE HAVE THE EARLIER AGE OF CONSENT IN CALIFORNIA FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT WITH THE EARLIER AGE OF CONSENT IN CALIFORNIA FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES HAVE WE HEARD. OF THAT THEIR ROLE. ISSUES THAT WOULD TURN ON THIS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF BOTH OF THOSE NO WE WOULD NOT AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS IN THIS WHOLE NOTION THAT KIDS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR HEALTH HISTORY- YOU COULD SAY THAT WELL THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO AND PICK. YOU KNOW OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HEALTH CARE PHYSICAL TREATMENT WOULD THANK YOU FOR SERIOUS INJURY BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY CAN'T RECITE THEIR OWN- HISTORY AND I'M SURE THEIR KIDS BACK OR GREATER RECITING THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE HISTORY ABOUT YOUR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD I BET YOU THERE ARE SEVEN YEAR OLDS WHO CAN'T RECITE OR CAN'T REMEMBER THEIR ENTIRE HEALTHCARE HISTORY I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE A FIFTY ONE. BUT I CAN REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO ME THE ENTIRE FIFTY ONE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN ALIVE AND SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT PEOPLE PERFECT HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. ARE TRAINED. TO ASK. AND TO AND TO HELP DEAL AND PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT RE EVERYTHING THAT'S A VERY VERY COMMON. SITUATION FOR IT I THINK FOR ANY KIND OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDED THAT THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU HAVE A PTIENT. THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON DOESN'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE HISTORY OR CAN'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING OR MIGHT MISS REMEMBER. AND SAY ONE THING BUT REALLY SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED. AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ARE TRAINED HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT AND SO THE BILL AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN NAVIGATING THE AS YOU KNOW SENATOR- AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER AREAS OF HEALTH CARE. FOR A LONG TIME AND SO THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT HERE. WELL THERE WAS A- YOU KNOW THE VOTERS HAVE VOTED ON. A NUMBER OF TIMES THE PARENTAL RIGHTS WITH REGARD TO- GETTING REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE YOUNGER AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING POLLING OUT COM CIVIL WAR IS THAT IN GENERAL IF LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT FOR THEIR OWN KIDS BUT THEY FELT THAT THERE WERE OTHER FAMILY STEP. THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN AS RESPONSIBLE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GRANT THAT IN THE BALLOT BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT MIGHT BE EXISTED IN OTHER PLACES A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT CAME UP- THERE WAS AN ISSUE ABOUT LIABILITY- COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED ABOUT. SURE WE HAVE- THERE'S A FEDERAL LAW THAT COMPLETELY OCCUPIES FIELD AND GOVERNS- LIABILITY OR COMPENSATION FOR VACCINE INJURY OCCURS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND WHEN THEY DO OCCUR THERE IS A FEDERAL PROCESS FOR SEEKING COMPENSATION AND NOT APPLY HERE. BECAUSE NUMBER KIDS HAVE BEEN VACCINATED FOR A LONG TIME- AND SOMETIMES ON THEIR OWN EACH PEOPLE YOU'RE HAPPY- OTHERWISE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND OF A VACCINE INJURY OCCURS THERE IS A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH- TO GET COMPENSATION AND THIS DOESN'T IN ANY WAY CHANGE I. AND SO THAT THAT LIABILITY SYSTEM IS WHAT IT IS A REMAIN THAT WAY THE BILL DOESN'T CHANGE NOR COULD REACH BUT THERE WAS AN IMPLICATION IN THE TESTIMONY THAT SOME HOW DOCTORS ARE FAMILIES WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT THIS BILL PASSED WELL AND SO. DOES THAT. PREJUDICE THAT YOUR STATE YEAH AND IT THIS BILL. DOESN'T CHANGE FOR PERRIN TO ALLOW. TO NOTE THERE ARE. THOSE EXISTING LAWS WANT ONE A CHILD TO. THERE'S EXIST MEDICAL CONFIDENTIALITY LAW- LIMITING WHAT A PARENT IS ALLOWED TO KNOW ABOUT THE KIDS. AND MET HEALTH CARE TREATMENT WITHOUT THE CONSENT. OF THE CHILD NOT EXISTING LAW ONE SECURE TERMS TWELVE YOU DO NOT HAVE COMPLETE BROAD ACCESS AS A PARENT TO EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR KIDS HEALTHCARE. AND SO WHATEVER CONCERNS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THAT THAT EXISTS. TODAY IF A KID HAS AN ADVERSE REACTION. THAT'S NOT GOING BE. A SECRET IN TERMS OF COMPENSATION POTENTIALLY AND THEIR PARENTS WHAT EVERY ABILITY TO FILE FOR COMPENSATION FOR THAT CHILD. AND YOU YOU INDICATED THAT THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT IS RARE. THE DEAD THE FACT THAT THIRD ENTRIES A RARE AND YET THERE WAS- TESTIMONY BELIEVED THAT IT HAPPENED TO THEIR KIDS HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO GO. NO ONE ARGUES THAT VACCINE INJURIES NEVER HAPPENED WITH THE DATE THAT THAT NO ONE IS SAYING THAT AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTIFIED ABOUT THEIR KIDS. BUT THAT'S BETTER EXPERIENCE AND I'M NOT IN ANY WAY DISPUTING WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT THEIR CHILD- BUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. OF CHILDREN WHO WERE VACCINATED. WE'RE NOT BOXING INJURED. AND WHO WERE ABLE TO AVOID. ATTENTIONAL GETTING VERY SICK OR DYING FROM MEASLES- HI I IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE RARE INSTANCES IN WHICH THE POLIO VACCINE HARM SOMEONE BUT BUT THAT AGAINST ALL THE CHILDREN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEBILITATED PARALYZED OR DEAD. HAD WE NOT HAD A MASS VACCINATION CAMPAIGN FOR POLIO. AND SOYOU YOU LOOK AT THOSE INJURIES. I'M EMPLOYEE WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE I WASN'T I WASN'T ALIVE DURING THE HORRIBLE YOU MIGHT PARENTS OR- GRANDPARENTS OF TALK TO ME ABOUT IT. THE ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE AND FEAR THAT SOCIETY LIVE FOR KNOWING EVERY YEAR. THAT SOME NUMBER OF KIDS WE'RE GONNA GET POLIO AND THEY MIGHT NO LONGER BE ABLE TO USE THEIR ARMS THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO WALK ANYMORE OR THEY MIGHT DIE MIT POWER ALLIES. I THANK GOD WE GOT THE POLIO VACCINE ACTUALLY DID A MASS VACCINATION CAMPAIGN. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA TO SPREAD MASS MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE POLIO VACCINE. AND CONGRESS SET UP A COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR THE VERY RARE INSTANCE IN WHICH SOMEONE IS INJURED. BUT HOW MANY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE EITHER ALIVE OR NOT PARALYZED TODAY. BECAUSE WE HAD A MASS POLIO VACCINATION CAMPAIGN. AND BECAUSE WE LET PEOPLE GET VACCINATED SO I AM NOT ANYWAY SAYING THAT. THE PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE AND THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCE AND WHAT AND AS A KID WAS INJURED. THAT BAD THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING AND THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE ARE LIVING WITH AND I AND I HONOR THAT AND I'M NOT THIS. THAT IN ANY WAY. BUT THEN WE HAVE TO AT THE BIG PICTURE OF THE MANY NNE OF. WHO HAVE HEALTHIER LIVES NOW BECAUSE EGGMAN OXIDATIVE. AND THEN MISTER CHAIR BUT TO MAKE. I THINK ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS- ABOUT BEING IN THE LEGISLATURE. IS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES THAT ISSUES ARE REPRESENTED TO BE BLACK AND WHITE. BUT IT IS ACTUALLY THE PRACTICAL CHOICE OF WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US IT HAPPENED THIS MORNING ON THE FLOOR- BECAUSE THE MICRO ITEM THAT CAME IN FRONT OF THIS IT WAS A CHOICE. BETWEEN THIS BIG COMPROMISE AND WHAT WOULD GO TO THE BALLOT IT WASN'T A CHOICE. REALLY BETWEEN THE CURRENT SITUATION. AND THAT COMPROMISE AND IT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORLD TICKETS IT WHEN TREES DIE. OF THE BIOMASS PROCESS IS NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND BUT THOSE TREES HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES ARE GOING TO JURY FORCED TO CREATE METHOD SO IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN. SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND BIOMASS IT AND THAT. IT AND. D. G. YOU JUST READ TO YOUR PARENTS HI EITHER EIGHT OR NINE. WHEN OURS IN LINE AND A POLIO Q. A SUGAR WITH POLICE. AND IT WAS- AND THERE WAS A IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT GOT POLIO BEFORE WE DID THAT NUMBER IN THAT CASE IT IS A MORE MINOR THING BUT HE COULDN'T LIST ARMS OR ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL. AND IT WAS A VERY VERY REAL FEAR WERE SUBJECT TO THAT. AND SO THEN ONCE AGAIN IT BECOMES A CHOICE IS IT IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN. THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING THAT SITUATION. FOR THE MASS VACCINATION WITH WHICH IN ESSENCE PREVENTED IT FOR MANY OF US IN IN WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AND I THINK. THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY ABOUT THIS AND IT WASN'T. NECESSARILY REPRESENTED IN SOME OF THE TESTIMONY BECAUSE IT WAS REPRESENTED AS AN ABSOLUTE. WHAT WHEN THERE'S A GRADIENT OF CHOICE HERE. IT IS AN WHAT IT IS AND THERE THERE IS AN IT I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN THERE AND WE HAD A SIMILAR CONTENTIOUS HEARING. I HAD TO SAY TO SOMEBODY THAT WAS TESTIFYING THAT RUDENESS WAS JUST NOT PERSUASIVE. AND IT'S LIKE I WAS LISTENING CLOSELY TO THE TESTIMONY AND IT'S THE REASON WHY. I ASKED YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE PRACTICAL FACTS THAT WERE PRESENTED IN THE TESTIMONY. THE WEATHER WAS THE LIABILITY. FOR THE REALITIES OF THE DC THING AGAINST THE LEGAL PART. BECAUSE I THINK THOSE THAT IS THE CHOICE IN FRONT OF US AND IT IS WEIGHING. A CHOICE THAT IS NOT AS CLEAR CUT BUT ONE THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO. I KNOW IS ESSENTIALLY THE STOP. ON A LENGTHY DISCUSSION AND I THINK SAID THAT THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN LAID ON THE TABLE. IN A VERY CLEAR WAY AND FOR ME NOW. GIVEN THE CHOICE IT'S LIKE I WILL VOTE TO MOVE ALONG AND I THINK SAID. THAT IT IS IMPORTANT IN THE HEATED DISCUSSION THAT EXISTS. TO HONOR. ARE THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE ADDRESSED AND I THINK YOU HAVE DONE A REASONABLE JOB. OF ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WERE THAT WERE RAISED IN THIS SO. I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO AND- BUT- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS ENGINE STORY THANK YOU SAID EARLIER OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. THE SENATOR ALSO THANK YOU- I KNOW YOU MADE REFERENCE TO IT BUT IF YOU COULD JUST- ZOOM IN ON. THE. NEED TO BE INFORMED. I THINK BY EVERYBODY IN PARTICULAR COURSE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUNGER- FOR OUR YOUNGER DAUGHTERS AND SONS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE ISSUE OF ARE THEY PROPERLY INFORMED HOW WILL WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE INFORMED THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE SURE- I JUST. OF COURSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEENAGERS ARE NOT TALK ABOUT SEVEN YEAR OLDS- AND- I I'M NOT A PHYSICIAN I'M NOT A PHARMACIST I'M NOT A I'M NOT A NURSE- BUT THOSE PROFESSIONALS VEGAS EXTENSIVELY TRAINED- AND- OUR THEIR JOB IS KNOWING HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT AGES- AND HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS AND HOW TO FERRET OUT INFORMATION- AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT A PERSON. BUT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONSENT TO ANY KIND OF GIVEN- ANY DIFFERENT FORM OF HEALTH CARE- THE FORMS OF HEALTH CARE THAT TEENAGERS CAN GET IN ON THAT ARE MUCH MORE INVASIVE. THAN A VACCINE- AND SO- THOSE PROFESSIONALS HYPOTHETICAL GUIDELINES AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND THEY HAVE TO. THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SET. WHETHER IT'S- THIRTEEN YEAR OLD TO THE LIKE I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN'T I'M NOT CONFIDENT THIS COULD REALLY UNDERSTANDS. OR AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD WHO WALKS IN. I'M WANTS SOMETHING AND SO I DON'T KNOW THIS PERSON IS FULLY- HEARING AND SO- IN THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRAINED TO DO AND I'VE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT ARE HERE. GOOD IF I COULD JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS MR TURNER- WELL I'M A MOM OF TWO SONS ADULT FUNDS I'M A GRANDMOTHER OF TWO GIRLS WHO WERE TWELVE AND THIRTEEN. THE FIT RIGHT INTO ROB FIT INTO THIS- AND WHAT WE HAVE BASICALLY DURING THE CALL BUT HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE VACCINATION WELL A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ME BEING VACCINATED- NOT. YOU KNOW THE YOUNGER. ONES IN OUR IN OUR FAMILY- AND THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE DEPENDED ON THE HEALTH CARE EXPERTS. TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND FEEL COMFORTABLE AND MAKING THAT DECISION. WELL I WE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE FULLY INFORMED WE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD RELY ON. I WHEN I GO TO THE DOCTORS AND NURSES I HAVE A RIGHT TO A SECOND OPINION ON A THIRD OPINION I'VE A RIGHT TO ALL OF THAT BUT FOR THE MOST PART I'M NOT THE PROFESSIONAL I COUNT ON THAT. BEING ABLE TO GIVING ME THE INFORMATION THE SCIENCE ON THE MEDICINE ALL AS TO WELL WHATEVER DECISION I'M I'M I'M GOING TO BE MAKING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS- REALLY MADE ME TURN- IN IN. FRANKLY IN IN SUPPORT WAS WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THIS WAS. A THE RIGHT TO TAKE A- FIX THE RIGHT BECAUSE TO RECEIVE A VACCINE THAT HAS BEEN FTA APPROVED. THAT IS REALLY IN. F. APPROVED ME THE- RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE A. C. I. P. OF THE SENATE THE FEDERAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. AND WE KNOW THAT THESE VACCINES UNDERGO EXTENSIVE- TRIALS THIS PROCESS IS NOT BY PASSING. APPROVAL WE CAN SEE ALREADY HOW LONG THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS TAKING FOR OUR YOUNGER. GROUPS AT ONES WERE REALLY REALLY TAKING TIME TO A- THERE'S- AREN'T. BACK CITY. FOR OUR YOUNGEST- AND I APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE THAT WE- THAT ARE. HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. TREAT THIS WITH- OF SUCH SENSITIVITY AND SUCH SERIOUSNESS- I THINK YOUNGER PEOPLE SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO KNOW AS MUCH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE. IT SHOULDN'T BE PARRIS JUST STEPPING UP IN FRONT OF THEM SAYING YOU'VE GOT TO DO THIS SO YOU GOT TO DO THAT WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHY WOULD ALL THE REASONS GIVE THEM. WE WANT THEM TO GROW UP TO BE YOU KNOW FULLY INFORMED THE BILL WHO CAN MAKE DECISIONS THAT STARTS WHEN ONE. YOUNGER YOU KNOW- FROM WHEN THE PANDEMIC YOU KNOW HIT US ALL WE WERE JUST. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS HOW DO WE AND AS THE CHAIR OF THE LATINO **** AS WE WERE PUSHING HARD TO MAKE SURE. THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAD ACCESS TO INFORMATION HAD ACCESS TO TESTING HAD ACCESS FINALLY TO A VACCINATION BUT ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEEDED- AND WITH THAT THEY MADE. DECISIONS UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THEM ARE ARE YOU KNOW WORKING TWO THREE JOBS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO. TO FOLLOW UP AS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT- WHILE WE ARE- WELL THIS IS GOING ON WE HAD TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THIS SO I FIGHT FOR THAT- EQUITY I FIGHT FOR THAT INFORMATION TO GET INTO OUR COMMUNITY. AND TO GET INTO. OUR CHILDREN'S OUR CHILDREN SHOULD UNDERSTAND MY GRANDDAUGHTERS I WANTED THEM TO UNDERSTAND THIS AND WE HAD GREAT DEBATES BACK AND FORTH- AND THE YOUNGER GRANDDAUGHTER SHE WAS LIKE. I'M READY I'M READY TO GET THIS VACCINATION SHE HELPED HER PARENTS MAKE THE DECISION. I MEAN I WAS JUST PROUD OF SEEING THE WHOLE PROCESS SO. I SUSPECT A LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CHILDREN- YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE WERE WERE TRUSTING WE TRUST EACH OTHER. MAKE SURE WE GET ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED FROM EACH OTHER THE YOUNGER ARE YOUNGER. YOU KNOW TEENAGERS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRUST US BUT IF FOR SOME REASON THEY THEIR LITTLE. NERVOUS ABOUT IT THEY CAN GO TO A PROFESSIONAL AND GET. I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT SOGNSVANN INTO THIS AND UP BASED ON OUR FAMILY IN OUR COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE- AND THE FACT THAT. THERE WERE NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO DIE FROM SO FAR FROM THIS PANDEMIC IN IN CALIFORNIA. I DON'T WANT TO SEE. TEENAGERS DIE FROM THIS- AND I WANT TO GET TO THESE ONE MILLION OR UNVACCINATED SO THANK YOU KNOW BE SUPPORTING. MOVE ALREADY HEALTH CENTER WHITE HOUSE COMPOSABLE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SEEING NONE ALL RIGHT OF. CENTER WIENER YOUR CLOTHES ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE- FOR- THE ANALYSIS AND THOUGHTFULNESS AND COLORS THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION TODAY- YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA. A FEW THINGS THAT I THINK SOMETIMES THIS BILL. THIS IS A DYNAMIC FOR. BUT CUTS S. IS LETTING THEIR KIDS GET MAX AND THAT IS ONE PIECE OF THIS. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT MOST KIDS MANY KIDS IF THEY WANT ABOUT ARE GOING TO TALK TO THEIR PARENTS ABOUT THE WE WANT KIDS TALK TO THEIR PARENTS A LITTLE COMFORTABLE TALKING TO THEIR PARENTS AND WE KNOW THAT SO MANY KIDS. EVEN IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO THEIR PARENTS NOT ALL BUT MANY. BUT THERE ARE SOME KIDS WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON CAN'T TALK TO THEIR PARENTS. FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT DYNAMIC JUST DOESN'T EXIST AND ARE COMFORTABLE DOING IT OR THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE DOING IT. AND THIS WILL EMPOWER THEM TO LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN HEALTH. BUT THERE ARE ALSO PLENTY OF SITUATIONS WITH MY DEMENTIA PARENTS HAVE NO ISSUE WITH VACCINATION BUT FOR WHAT EVER REASON ARE NOT MAKING A TIME OR CAN'T MAKE THE TIME. AND FOR SOME PARENTS IDEA OF SAYING TO YOUR KID HEY ON THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL TODAY ONE TO YOU STOP BY WALGREENS AND GET THE FLU SHOT. THAT'S A BENEFIT TO THOSE PARENTS I JUST MAKE SURE. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE OF ALL THE COMPLEXITY HERE. BUT IN THE END THIS IS ABOUT TEENAGERS BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR OWN HEALTH THIS BILL WILL MOVE US IN THAT DIRECTION WHEN I RESPECTFULLY ASTRONOMICAL.
