NUMBER ONE YOU CANNOT IMPERSONATE A SEXIST OFFICER NUMBER TWO YOU CAN OUT ACT LIKE YOU'RE PURSUING A THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THIS IS CRITICAL PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE SCANS ARE HAPPEN OUR COMMUNITIES IN IN MORE POORLY WE STAND LOSE BILLIONS DOLLARS OR EVEN POTENTIALLY COORDINATION WITH ICE AND OTHER AGENCIES WHEN FOLKS ARE BEING COUNTED THEN HAS A COUPLE OF THE PROVISIONS IN THERE WE WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR HARD WORK HELPING US TO GET YOUR SECRETARY IT'S OFFICE I WILL BE SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL.

YOU MISTER SANTIAGO ARE THERE ANY OTHER WHICH- IS IN SUPPORT. HI MY NAME FIFTY EIGHT. HERE ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY STATE OUT EXPEDIA WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR HEARING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE TODAY. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CENSUS AND- AS THE AUTHOR EXPLAINED WE BELIEVE THAT IN ADDITION TO. THE DETERRENT FACTOR OF AN ENSURING THAT THEY'RE NOT IMPERSONATIONS THAT WE ALSO. MAKE CLEAR TO ALL THIS. RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING THE CENSUS AND THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASK FOR ASSISTANCE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THEY CAN VERIFY. A CENSUS WORKER. AND THAT. WE ARE ENCOURAGING THEM BY PROTECTING THEM TO TAKE THE CENSUS. WE HAVE WORKED ON THE LANGUAGE WAS STAFF SO WE WANT TO. THANK ALL THOSE INVOLVED AND ALSO WITH GROUPS WHO UNFORTUNATELY ON SHORT NOTICE COULD NOT. COME HERE TODAY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION MALL THAT. AND HELLO. SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CHRIS FOR SIGNS OF THE TRAILER LET'S REMAIN IMMIGRANT RIGHTS WE JUST FOUND A POSITIONAL YESTERDAY AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE YOU WELL. I HAVE A QUESTION IN YOUR QUESTION FOR MR LACKEY. YES GOOD MORNING I'D JUST OF NEED SOME CLARIFICATION AS TO WHY THIS DOESN'T ALREADY FALL UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION FIVE TWENTY NINE WHICH IS FALSE IMPERSONATION. WELL WHAT IT SET WHEN CALIFORNIA WE CAN QUALIFY WHATEVER BECAUSE WE WANT TO GO TO FIGHT IN THE IN THE SENSE BILL OF RIGHTS SO LET ME ANSWER DIFFERENTLY WE WANNA BE'S WE WANT TO BE SQUEAKY CLEAN AND CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT IMPERSONATE A CENSUS WORKER. AND THAT YOU CANNOT ACT AS IF YOU'RE IMPERSONATING A CENSUS WORKER SO THERE ARE LAWS ABOUT IMPERSONATING THEIR LAWS ABOUT SCAMMING BUT WE WANT TO BE. ABSOLUTELY CRYSTAL CLEAR AND YOU AND I WILL PUBLIC BOTH AGREE THAT IT'S A BI PARTISAN EFFORT THAT WE ASSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUES TO HAVE ALL ITS CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION NUMBER ONE WHEN IT COMES TO COUNTING AND THE NUMBER TWO ALL THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE STAND TO LOSE. FIVE SO I THINK I THINK WE WOULD AGREE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE AS IT RELATES TO SECURING THE CALIFORNIA GETS ITS FAIR SHARE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO IF THERE ARE ANY MEASURES THAT WE CAN TAKE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY IS COUNTED AND FEEL SAFE BEING COUNTED. I'M SURE THAT YOU YOU YOU'D AGREE THAT THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT. I JUST LIKE TO ADD. AS THE ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION THAT PENAL CODE FIVE TWENTY NINE REQUIRE SOMETHING OF VALUE IS MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT IS TRANSMITTED SO THAT WHEN THEY IMPERSONATE THEY OBTAIN SOMETHING OF VALUE. IT IS HARD TO CODIFY. THE DETERRENCE OF JUST. FOR INSTANCE IF I WANTED TO SOMEONE AND I SAID I'M FROM THE CENSUS. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE IT. YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD FILL OUT THE SURVEY OR I PRETENDED TO BE FROM THE CENSUS AND AYE DETER DO FROM TAKING IT. QUALIFYING THAT AMOUNT IS DIFF. DIFFICULT AS OPPOSED TO TRADITIONAL FORMS OF FRIED WHERE YOU WOULD SAY. I'D LIKE YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER. AND SAID THIS CLARIFIES THAT THIS IS JUST TO SEEK OUT INFORMATION. AND TO INTERFERE. WITH THE PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY UP MISS COME LOADED UP. THANK YOU I WAS WANTING COULD YOU SHARE WHAT WHY THE THOUGHT WAS TO MAKE IT A MISDEMEANOR RATHER THAN AN INFRACTION. I THINK THE IDEA WAS THAT WE WANTED TO WEIGH THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CRIME. AND IT IS CRITICAL I MEAN IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR. YES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WERE TERRIFIED ABOUT GETTING COUNTED AND WE THOUGHT THAT WE THOUGHT THAT. I REALIZE THAT THAT WE NEED FROWN UPON CREATE AN ADDITIONAL. CRIMES FOR REASONS FOR PEOPLE TO BE. PENALIZED IN THE SYSTEM BUT THIS ONE'S CRITICAL I MEAN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST PEOPLE SCAMMING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE COMING TO PEOPLE'S DOORS GRABBING PERSONAL INFORMATION DOCUMENT AND DOT ARE NOT DOCUMENTED AND POTENTIALLY A COORDINATING WHAT WITH AGENCIES A THE- WHAT'S THE TO SAY YOU CAN POTENTIALLY CORNY WITH ICE AND THIS IS CRITICAL HE CAN SCAN PEOPLE IT'S HAPPENING IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ALL THE TIME. WE'RE ALREADY START TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE KNOCK ON THE DOOR NOW THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE WERE SCAMMING IT DIRECTLY FOR SOME SORT OF MONETARY GAIN. BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO WILL BE STARS CAM AS SCAMMING WILL START COLLECTING INFORMATION FOR OTHER OTHER PURPOSES IT MAY NOT BE MONETARY PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET COUNTER AREAS AND WILL WE TELL ON THAT THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED FROM. FROM BEING SICK FROM BEING SORRY I KEEP MISSING OR SCANNED THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED WHEN THEY'RE BEING COUNTED IN THAT THEIR INFORMATION ISN'T GOING TO BE USED FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE SENSES IF IT'S A CENSUS WORKER WE NEED TO PUT SOME TEETH TO IT DOES NOT ANY TEETH IT'S. NOT GONNA. THAT IT'S NOT GONNA HAVE THE IMPACT WE WANT. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE. IT IS ALREADY. LOGGED IN BUT THEY'RE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT SOMEONE ELSE THAT'S AFFILIATED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT MY GUIDE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE A SQUEAKY CLEAN THAT IT YOU CANNOT IMPERSONATE OR ACT LIKE IMPERSONATING A CENSUS WORKER. TO ADD ON THERE ARE SPECIFIC CARVE OUTS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMPERSONATION AS YOU NOTED TO SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OR REPRESENTATIVES FOR INSTANCE FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN BOROUGH BUT THERE ISN'T. A COLLECTIVE IMPERSONATION OF A GOVERNMENT WORKER. STATURE I'M SORRY WE SHOULD BE TALKING TO THE CHURCH I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT NO IT WAS INTERESTING CONVERSATION BUT WE SHOULD DOES I APOLOGIZE. ANY MORE QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY WOMAN COME LOADED OF. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER SANTIAGO I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE MISTER THANK YOU I AND HOPEFULLY. PART OF THE COMFORT LEVEL THAT I HAD ON A MISDEMEANOR AND IT IS NOT OBVIOUS BUT ONE CHANGE ANYTHING BUT I'M HOPING THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MOVING TO HAVING JUDGES HAVING MORE DISCRETION. AND I KNOW IT'S WRITTEN MISDEMEANOR. FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE OR BOTH HOPEFULLY IT'S A THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE. OR A MISDEMEANOR OR BOTH IT'S A DEAD ESCALATES NOT GO TO THE AND WHICH I THINK IS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND I'M HOPING THAT JUDGES NO. AS THEY LOOK AT THE SEVERITY OF EACH CASE AND HOPEFULLY OR NONE BUT AS A LOOK AT THE SEVERITY OF EACH CASE THEY KNOW TO ESCALATE IT AND THAT MAYBE TO PREFERENCES IS FINANCIAL FIRST BEFORE YOU INCARCERATE AND THEN. INCARCERATED AND TO DO BOTH. SO GOD THE CHURCH RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE. CALDERON CLICK ON AB FIFTEEN SIXTY THREE MOTION FOR SEVEN AMENDMENTS TO BE CONCURRED IN JONES SAWYER.
