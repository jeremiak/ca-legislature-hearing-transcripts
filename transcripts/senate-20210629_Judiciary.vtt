00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.072
COUPLE EURO ALSO. PERSONAL

BORDERS. THANK YOU CHAIR. I WAS

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:55.080
IN A IN SAN DIEGO AWHILE BACK.

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.349
AND SOMEONE SCOOTER CAME

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:02.320
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE- MY KIDS AND

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:04.589
IT CAUSED ME YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.492
AS A PARENT I WAS CONCERNED-

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:09.394
BUT THEN YOU KNOW AS THE

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:12.064
MINUTES IN THE HOURS WENT BY

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.665
AND JUST KIND OF CURIOUS ON HOW.

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:16.601
THIS BUSINESS MODEL EXISTS AND

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:19.204
LO AND BEHOLD THIS BILL. FOUND

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:21.840
ITS WAY OVER HERE- I KNOW THE

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:23.742
AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT- HE IS A

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:26.745
MAN OF HIS WORD AND HE'S TRYING

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:28.814
TO DO THE RIGHT THING I THINK

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.115
ON THEIR MANY COMPONENTS IN

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:32.350
THIS THAT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:35.587
FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN YOU LEAVE A

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:36.354
SCOOTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:40.025
WALKWAY THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:42.294
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE ARE YOU

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.396
KNOW WITH DISABILITIES- WHEN

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:46.398
YOU LEAVE IT- YOU KNOW PARKED

00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:49.034
IN. IN DANGER SOCIETIES OR ANY

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:51.303
VARIATION. I THINK THERE NEEDS

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:52.604
TO BE SOME IMPROVEMENT WITH THE

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:53.972
SCOOTER COMPANIES AND THOSE

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:56.808
THAT USE THOSE- PIECES OF

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:58.443
EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE. A

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.312
DEGREE OF EXPECTATION

00:23:00.378 --> 00:23:02.347
INCOMPETENCE WHEN IT COMES TO

00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:03.882
HOW THE IMPACT TO THE COMMUNITY

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:06.785
AND TO THE WORLD AROUND THEM-

00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:07.552
BY VIRTUE OF USING THOSE

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:09.621
SERVICES. SO JUST TRYING TO

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:12.124
FIGURE OUT- TO LOSE SOME OF THE

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.992
GOOD THINGS THE BRAILLE ISSUE I

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.660
THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.996
BUT WE'RE IN THE COURSE OF A OF

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:19.664
A OF A LEGISLATIVE CYCLE WHERE

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:21.199
AMENDMENTS ARE BEING THROWN

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:22.834
QUICKLY AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.136
KEEP UP WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:26.571
BEING. SAID MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:28.740
THAT THERE WAS A NEW CAP ON THE

00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:32.144
INSURANCE- POLICY AMOUNT I

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.545
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS FOR

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.247
EXAMPLE I THINK IN MY DRAFT IS

00:23:35.313 --> 00:23:39.551
THAT I'M A MILLION. BUT I THINK

00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:40.152
THAT'S GOING ON WAS A HUNDRED

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:42.254
THOUSAND. HUNDRED THOUSAND SO

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.555
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT AFTER

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:45.457
TALKING WITH BOTH SIDES ON THIS

00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:47.492
ISSUE THAT THERE THIS MIGHT BE

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:50.195
A SITUATION WHERE- THERE COULD

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:53.131
BE EVEN FURTHER COMPROMISE

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:55.333
BECAUSE IF YOU PUT FORWARD A

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.069
MANDATE FOR A THIRD PARTY

00:23:58.136 --> 00:24:01.339
LIABILITY POLICY. INHABIT A

00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:02.407
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.576
COULD VERY WELL FORCE OUT THE

00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:07.112
BUSINESS ITSELF MEANING THAT

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:08.513
ITS BUSINESS MODEL MAY NOT BE

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.116
ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE- THAT TYPE

00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:13.585
OF OVERHEAD ON A PER OCCURRENCE

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:14.686
AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:18.123
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST. NOT ALLOW

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.192
FOR SOME PROTECTIONS INTO WHERE

00:24:20.258 --> 00:24:21.660
EXACTLY IS THAT- THAT SWEET

00:24:21.726 --> 00:24:23.128
SPOT THAT HAS YET TO BE%

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:25.597
DETERMINED BUT MY CONCERN IS

00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:27.599
THAT WE MAY BE SQUEEZING OUT

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:29.067
THIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT DOES

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.770
HAVE SOME UTILITY- BY VIRTUE OF

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:33.405
THIS INSURANCE POLICY AND I

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:34.739
KNOW IN THE PAST THE

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:37.576
MUNICIPALITIES THAT WERE POSED

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:39.477
WITH A COVERAGE REQUEST. MEAN

00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:41.112
THE MUNICIPALITIES OPPOSED IT

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:45.050
AS WELL- SO I WAS WONDERING

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:45.650
IMAGE THROW THIS OUT THERE TO

00:24:45.717 --> 00:24:48.253
THE AUTHOR. WHAT IF WE WERE. TO

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.021
COME UP WITH A COMPROMISE THAT

00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:54.826
IDENTIFIES. A SET DOLLAR AMOUNT.

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.228
EVERY TIME SOMEBODY OPENS AN

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:57.495
ACCOUNT TO ARBOR TIME SOMEBODY

00:24:57.562 --> 00:25:00.966
USES- THE SCOOTER THAT THERE BE

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:02.801
IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:05.570
CHARGE A SURCHARGE. LET'S SEE

00:25:05.637 --> 00:25:06.304
SEVENTY FIVE CENTS OR A DOLLAR

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.073
WHAT WHATEVER IT MAY BE THAT

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:09.741
GOES INTO A VICTIMS

00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:11.576
COMPENSATION FUND. SO

00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:12.677
ESSENTIALLY BECOMES A

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:15.914
COMPENSATION FUND TO HELP THOSE

00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:18.884
WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED. AND NEED

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.953
TO HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS ARE

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.155
FOR WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED BUT IT

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:26.925
DOESN'T UNDO THE BUSINESS MODEL

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.526
AND RUN THE ENTIRE SCOOTER

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:30.528
INDUSTRY OUT OF BUSINESS AND I

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:31.830
DIDN'T KNOW IF- I MIGHT BE IN

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:33.832
THE COMMENTS IF THAT'S MORE OF

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:34.499
A QUESTION AT THIS POINT MISTER

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:37.035
CHAIR. OFF I COULD DIRECT IT TO

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:38.937
THE AUTHOR IF HE WOULD BE HIS

00:25:39.004 --> 00:25:39.804
THOUGHTS ON THAT IF YOU'RE

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:40.672
WILLING TO CONSIDER THAT

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:43.008
FURTHER SURE BUT LET ME ASK THE

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:45.277
AUTHOR OF. PHONE NUMBER DO YOU

00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:46.278
CARE TO RESPOND NOW OR IN YOUR

00:25:46.344 --> 00:25:47.979
CLOTHES BUT LET ME RESPOND NOW

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:49.648
ALL RIGHT- AND I WANT TO THANK

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:51.583
THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT WAS

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.951
THEIR AMENDMENTS THAT BROUGHT

00:25:53.018 --> 00:25:56.021
IT DOWN. TO THAT NUMBER AND I

00:25:56.087 --> 00:25:58.323
BELIEVE SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.026
THAT PROBLEM- WE NEED TO HAVE

00:26:01.092 --> 00:26:04.062
SOME DOLLAR AMOUNT AND WITHOUT.

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:06.698
WITHOUT SOME DATA WE NEED TO BE

00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:08.466
ABLE TO PUT IT AT SOME COST.

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:12.103
THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS NOT

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.839
I REPEAT NOT TO PUT THIS GROUP

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:16.875
IS THIS OUT OF BUSINESS. AND IN

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:18.410
FACT WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS

00:26:18.476 --> 00:26:21.346
BECOMES A MITIGATING PART OF IT

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.281
BECAUSE MY THE MEMBERS FROM LA

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:26.518
MAY KNOW- THERE ARE ATTORNEYS.

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:28.720
WHO ARE NOW HAVE COMMERCIALS

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:31.122
OUT TO SUE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:33.525
INJURED BY STEVE B. DEVICES AND

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.093
SCOOTERS WHICH I THINK WILL BE

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.662
EVEN MORE DRASTICALLY IMPACT

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:39.998
THAT INDUSTRY I THINK THIS BILL

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:41.199
PROVIDING SOME KIND OF

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:43.268
INSURANCE COULD BUFFER SOME OF

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:44.636
THAT AND SO WE NEED TO WORK

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:46.805
TOGETHER. TO ENSURE THAT THIS

00:26:46.871 --> 00:26:48.740
DESCRIPTIVE GO OUT BECAUSE

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:50.875
THEY'RE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:55.880
THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE. SAME

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:56.481
BEST INTENTIONS AS I DO A THE

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:58.516
KEEP THIS GROUP. IN IN BUSINESS

00:26:58.583 --> 00:26:59.284
I DON'T KNOW I'VE HAVE TO LOOK

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:01.953
AT. THE MODEL YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.955
HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT IS HOW YOU

00:27:04.022 --> 00:27:04.422
KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:07.459
PERMUTATIONS BUT- DEFINITELY

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:09.160
WHO IT IS IF THE SCOOTER

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:10.662
COMPANIES WILL WORK WITH US

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:12.097
LOOK WHEN I FIRST TOLD US THERE

00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:14.299
WERE NO INSURANCE COMPANIES WE

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:15.233
HAD TO GO FIND THE INSURANCE

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.602
COMPANIES THE CARRIERS FROM ALL

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:18.403
ACROSS THE COUNTRY SAID THEY

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.538
WOULD DO IT. NOW YOU KNOW WE'VE

00:27:20.605 --> 00:27:22.607
BEEN WE'VE BEEN STYMIED EVERY

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:24.142
STEP OF THE WAY TO GET THIS

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:26.711
DONE AND SO FROM MY CLIENTS ARE

00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:28.413
MY PEOPLE I'M REPRESENTING

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.482
PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED THEY

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:32.884
JUST WANT TO BE ABLE. TO GET

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:35.520
THEIR INJURIES- COMPENSATED FOR

00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:36.888
HER WELL THAT'S THAT'S

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:38.456
FANTASTIC TO HEAR I'M GLAD YOU

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:42.093
WERE YOU WERE OPENED ON TO- TO

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.529
THIS AS AN IDEA I KNOW THAT-

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:46.364
THE SCOOTER COMPANIES SEEM TO

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:48.299
BE INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.602
THIS FURTHER- I THINK THIS IS

00:27:50.668 --> 00:27:53.004
GOING TO GO TO INSURANCE NEXT

00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:55.106
FOR ME BETWEEN NOW AND THEN-

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:56.007
THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:57.742
COULD BE- LOOKED INTO IN

00:27:57.809 --> 00:27:59.511
GREATER DETAIL. THE OTHER THING

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:01.646
IS- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:03.848
PREMIUMS OF INSURANCE I DON'T

00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:07.218
THINK I'VE SEEN ANY ESTIMATE BY

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:11.189
AN INSURANCE CARRIER. ON WHAT

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:11.790
OVERHEAD THAT WOULD BE. THE I

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:12.390
THINK IS GOING TO BE SSENTIAL

00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:13.825
BEFORE LIKE THIS ALSO MOVES

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:15.326
FORWARD. ON TO THE NEXT

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:17.495
COMMITTEE IS THAT IF THE

00:28:17.562 --> 00:28:19.097
SCOOTER COMPANY SAYING IT'S

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:21.499
COST PROHIBITIVE. I'D LOVE TO

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:23.468
HEAR IT SEE IT ESTIMATE OR IF

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:24.702
IN YOUR CASE YOU'RE SAYING THAT

00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:26.471
IT IS DOABLE I'D LOVE TO SEE AN

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:29.674
ESTIMATE. ON WHAT TYPE OF-

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:31.209
KERRIER LIKE REDUCTIONS.

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:33.445
BECAUSE WE ARE ELEVATING. THE-

00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:36.181
THE ARRANGEMENT. BETWEEN FIVE

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:37.515
THE SCOOTER RENTER DISCOVER

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:39.684
COMPANY IN A THIRD PARTY IN

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:40.452
WAYS THAT CERTAINLY DON'T

00:28:40.518 --> 00:28:43.588
EXIST. S. COUNTERPARTS TO

00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:45.924
RENTING A VEHICLE. AND I THINK

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.859
IF WE CAN ANSWER THOSE TOO THEN

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:50.295
I THINK WE- HAVE SOMETHING HERE

00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:52.564
THAT CAN WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.231
LOOK AFTER THE FOLKS THAT

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:55.166
YOU'RE LOOKING AFTER A

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:55.767
SPECIALLY THOSE IN THE DESERT

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:58.002
WITH DISABILITIES. BECAUSE I

00:28:58.069 --> 00:28:59.671
THINK IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE

00:28:59.737 --> 00:29:01.806
THAT A PERSON COULD BE INJURED.

00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:03.942
AND HAVE NO ONE TO GO AFTER IT

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:05.110
DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE NOT

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:06.911
THE COMPANY NOT THE INDIVIDUAL

00:29:06.978 --> 00:29:08.947
PRESUMABLY THE INDIVIDUAL. WHO

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:11.382
IS RENTING- MAY NOT NECESSARILY

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:12.851
HAVE THE DEEPEST POCKETS GIVEN

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:14.986
POTENTIAL MEDICAL. COSTS

00:29:15.053 --> 00:29:16.087
ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANTIAL

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:17.522
INJURIES TO SOMEWHERE IN

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.157
BETWEEN THERE SO FOR YOUR MAN

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:20.892
YOUR WORD I HOPE THAT THESE

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:22.760

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:25.063
DISCUSS THIS AS AN OPTION

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.831
BECAUSE I THINK. A COMPENSATION

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:28.800
FUND COULD GIVE YOU EVERYTHING

00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:31.870
YOU WANT IN THE PUBLIC WHAT IT

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:34.172
MEANS FOR THE ENTITY TO

CONTINUE TO STAY IN BUSINESS

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.075

THE SIZE OF THE INSURANCE- AT

00:30:09.841 --> 00:30:12.544
POLICIES AND I GUESS I LOOK AT

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.145
IT IN TERMS OF- A MOVING

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:15.413
VEHICLE AND WHAT'S AT THE

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.182
MINIMUM WE HAVE TO HAVE AND BY

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:22.654
MOVING AT. A CAR OR A VAN- IT

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.557
WILL DO A LOT MORE DAMAGE

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:28.993
POTENTIALLY THEN THIS KIND OF-

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.796
VEHICLE WHEN IT'S MOVING SO BUT

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:32.864
I'LL LEAVE THAT TO INSURANCE

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:34.065
IT'S GOING TO GO TO INSURANCE

WANTED TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:39.204
AND I GUESS AS I WAS THINKING

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.707
ABOUT THIS- I WAS WONDERING HOW

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:47.011
DO WE DEAL WITH OTHER MOVING.

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:49.447
VEHICLES THAT WE RENT WHETHER

THAT WOULD COVER A LOT OF THESE

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:20.878
THINGS BECAUSE I'M- I'M- I

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:21.879

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:16.454
TODAY. BUT I JUST WANT TO PUT

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:17.622
THIS INTO THE ETHER OF THE

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:19.157
DISCUSSION I SUSPECT IT'LL GET

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:21.826
DISCUSSED IN. INSURANCE BUT IF

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:22.827
YOU'RE IN A CAR OR IF YOU'RE A

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.729
MINIMUM AMOUNTS IN YOUR CARS

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:26.597

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:27.231
THOUSAND OR SOMETHING IN THIS

00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:28.766
IS MUCH HIGHER. YOU KNOW IT

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:30.868
JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT THE

00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:35.273
AUTOMOBILE- LIABILITY. LIMITS

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:37.275
SHOULD INFORM THE THINKING HERE

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.676
OR THE NATURE OF THE RISK

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:40.645
SHOULD INFORM THE THINKING AND

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:41.579
I KNOW THAT THE OFFICE AS THAT

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:43.147
I JUST. THOUGHT IT WAS

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:44.248
APPROPRIATE TO MENTION IT THE

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:45.650
DISCUSSION OF THE SUPPORTING

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:47.185
HIM. BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:48.953
AS WE TALK TO INSURANCE WE'VE

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.854
GOT ATTACHED TO SOME OF THOSE

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:51.722
LIMITS. AND HOW THE FUNDING

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:52.924
HAPPENS BUT THERE HAS TO BE A

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.326
FUND AS A CENTER CUBBY- SAYS.

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:56.894
OF SOME SORTS WHETHER IT'S

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:58.096
INSURANCE FUNDED OR OTHERWISE

00:34:58.162 --> 00:35:00.231
FUNDED. BUT THE NUMBERS NEED TO

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:02.934
REFLECT. THE RISK BUT TO

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.469
SOCIETY I THINK THE NUMBERS ARE

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:05.503
JUST WAY OUT OF WHACK THANK

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.505

YOUR COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:15.379
MOBILITY BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE IN

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:17.315

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:18.249
NINE DEALS WITH EQUESTRIAN

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:19.951
SAFETY SO IT'LL BE MORE ALONG

00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:21.385
THE LINES OF. SOMETHING YOU'RE

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:25.923
FAMILIAR. WITH- ALL RIGHT.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.925
TURNING NOW TO. SENATOR ALL. I

00:35:27.992 --> 00:35:30.528
JUST THIS ISN'T A SOLUTION BUT

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:32.697
WHAT MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:34.198
IS THAT THIS IS PART OF THE GIG

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:36.000
ECONOMY NOW WHERE YOU DON'T

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:37.435
HAVE THE BRICKS AND MORTARS YOU

THE COMPANY IS YOU KNOW WHO'S

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:44.675

WHEN THEY WERE STRUCK FROM

HOSPITALIZATION BOTH HORSES

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:05.641

REFLECTIVE GEAR IT'S POSSIBLE

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.245
THAT THE TRIBAL ACCENT COULD

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:10.813
HAVE BEEN AVOIDED AND THIS IS

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.981
NOT THE FIRST TIME SUCH AN

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:13.215
INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED HERE AND

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:14.750

HORSES IT'S JUST THE SMART

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:22.825
THING TO DO NOT ONLY FOR SAFETY

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:24.093
OF THE WRITERS AND THE FORCES

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.728

RISK THEY WANT TO TAKE IT'S

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:45.281
IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN BE

SENATOR RUSSELL. THANK YOU MR

01:50:49.542 --> 01:50:52.645
CHAIRMAN. THE QUESTION TO THE

01:50:52.712 --> 01:50:56.850
AUTHOR YES- I'M TRYING TO

01:50:56.916 --> 01:50:58.885
NARROW DOWN HERE WHEN I THINK

01:50:58.952 --> 01:51:01.087
OF ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:03.757
ISSUES AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT

01:51:03.823 --> 01:51:06.693
AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME- THAT

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.029
THERE IS A CODE ISSUE OF USING

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:11.564
INFORMATION WITHOUT THE USERS

01:51:11.631 --> 01:51:17.137
CONSENT- BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO.

01:51:17.203 --> 01:51:18.938
DRAWING THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT'S

01:51:19.005 --> 01:51:20.874
CONSIDERED CONSUMER INFORMATION

01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:22.542
AND PRIVATE MEDICAL

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:25.779
INFORMATION- I TOTALLY AGREE

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:27.981
THAT SHARING WITHOUT THE USERS

01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:29.916
CONSENT IS A REALLY BIG PROBLEM

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:31.851
AND WE'VE COME ACROSS THIS OVER

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:34.487
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN- NOT

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:37.791
HAVING THE USER'S PERMISSION.

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:40.326
ON THE OTHER ISSUE OF DRAWING

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:42.996
THE LINE IT IT SEEMS TO ME AND

01:51:43.063 --> 01:51:44.697
THIS IS WHERE I'D APPRECIATE

01:51:44.764 --> 01:51:46.833
SOME GUIDANCE FROM THE AUTHOR

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.468
IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS A BIG

01:51:48.535 --> 01:51:50.770
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW A

01:51:50.837 --> 01:51:53.973
FIT BIT- OR CERTAIN MONITORS

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:59.145
THAT WE MIGHT WEAR. AND THE-

01:51:59.212 --> 01:52:03.349
MUCH MORE- EXTENSIVE INSTRUCTOR

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:05.985
MEDICAL PRIVACY LAWS LIKE MY

01:52:06.052 --> 01:52:07.687
MEDICAL RECORD WOULD BE

01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:09.089
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM UP

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:11.191
FITBIT SO I'M TRYING TO

01:52:11.257 --> 01:52:13.726
UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES AT HAND

01:52:13.793 --> 01:52:17.330
IS THERE ANY WAY TO AMEND TO

01:52:17.397 --> 01:52:19.632
ADDRESS THOSE ARE THOSE

01:52:19.699 --> 01:52:22.802
CONCERNS BECAUSE I DO THINK IT

01:52:22.869 --> 01:52:24.504
MIGHT BE EXTENDING THAT SO MUCH

01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:26.973
TO. CONSIDER ALL OF THESE

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:31.111
PRODUCTS AS UNDER THE OF MORE

FOR YOUR QUESTION- WITH RESPECT

01:52:39.119 --> 01:52:40.453
TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LET'S

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:42.088
SAY CONSUMER INFORMATION VERSUS

01:52:42.155 --> 01:52:43.990
MEDICAL INFORMATION. I THINK

01:52:44.057 --> 01:52:44.824
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:46.326
TRYING TO KIND A TO TRY TO

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:48.495
ADDRESS IN THIS BILL IS TO MAKE

01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:50.497
SURE THAT MEDICAL INFORMATION

01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:53.333
IS PROTECTED. ALL WHETHER IT IS

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:54.667
BEING GENERATED AND A DOCTOR'S

01:52:54.734 --> 01:52:58.304
OFFICE OR COLLECTED BY WAY OF A

01:52:58.371 --> 01:53:01.040
DEVICE OR APPLICATION. NOW

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:02.675
CURRENT LAW ALREADY PROVIDES

01:53:02.742 --> 01:53:05.078
THAT BUSINESSES ATTACKED OUR

01:53:05.145 --> 01:53:07.080
MANUFACTURER PRODUCED ALL

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:08.715
SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE THAT

01:53:08.781 --> 01:53:10.717
COLLECTS MEDICAL INFORMATION TO

01:53:10.783 --> 01:53:13.720
BE SUBJECT OF UNDER CLIA SO IN

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:16.089
OTHER WORDS LET'S SEE A DOCTOR-

01:53:16.156 --> 01:53:17.323
HOUSE AN APPLICATION THAT

01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:19.559
WOULD. COLLECT INFORMATION

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:20.593
PATIENT INFORMATION HEART RATES

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.462
OR OTHERWISE THAT WOULD BE

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:24.030
CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION

01:53:24.097 --> 01:53:26.366
THAT IS UNDER CLIA. ON THE

01:53:26.432 --> 01:53:29.969
OTHER HAND IF SOMEBODY USES- AN

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.671
APPLICATION FOR SUBMISSION

01:53:31.738 --> 01:53:33.673
FITBIT SO IF SOMEBODY USES THE

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:35.942
FITBIT TO START RECORDING

01:53:36.009 --> 01:53:37.110
INFORMATION SUCH AS HEART RATE

01:53:37.177 --> 01:53:38.878

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:40.847
SIMILAR- INFORMATION FOR EATING

WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. THAT

01:53:43.983 --> 01:53:45.919
INFORMATION IS NOT COVERED

01:53:45.985 --> 01:53:48.054
UNDER CLIA BECAUSE SIMPLY

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:50.056
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS

01:53:50.123 --> 01:53:52.058
BEING COLLECTED OUTSIDE OF THE

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:53.626
CONFINES OF THE MEDICAL OFFICE

01:53:53.693 --> 01:53:55.929
OR NOT BEING IN POSSESSION OF

01:53:55.995 --> 01:53:57.697
THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE NOW WE'RE

01:53:57.764 --> 01:53:59.032
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME SET OF

01:53:59.098 --> 01:54:01.534
INFORMATION BOTH HEART RATE.

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:02.936
HEART RATE AND SLEEPING

01:54:03.002 --> 01:54:04.537
PATTERNS OF BREATHING RATE IN

01:54:04.604 --> 01:54:06.739
BOTH SCENARIOS BUT IN ONE

01:54:06.806 --> 01:54:08.675
SCENARIO IT IS COVERED UNDER

01:54:08.741 --> 01:54:10.810
CMI ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS NOT

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:12.779
COVER IF THE INFORMATION IS

01:54:12.845 --> 01:54:13.680
BEING COLLECTED BY THE DEVICE

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:18.751
OR THE APPLICATION. SO WE TRY

01:54:18.818 --> 01:54:19.552
TO CLOSE THAT GAP. SO DOT IS

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:20.787
THE IS THE- YOU KNOW THAT IS

01:54:20.853 --> 01:54:22.088
THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THAT

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:23.323
WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT SO IT

01:54:23.389 --> 01:54:24.457
WOULD TALK ABOUT THE SAME

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:25.825

STRESS LEVEL SLEEPING PATTERNS

01:54:30.597 --> 01:54:32.398
BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL AND ALL THAT

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:33.833
INFORMATION IS A SHOULD BE

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:34.968
CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION

01:54:35.034 --> 01:54:36.302
BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:38.238
MEDICAL INFORMATION. IT IS

01:54:38.304 --> 01:54:38.938
GENERATED LET'S SAY IN A

01:54:39.005 --> 01:54:40.773
DOCTOR'S OFFICE. SO WE TRY TO

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:43.243
CLOSE THAT GAP. FOR THE MAKE

01:54:43.309 --> 01:54:45.712
SURE THERE IS CONSISTENCY ARE

01:54:45.778 --> 01:54:46.512
YOU KNOW FOR INFORMATION THA'S

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:47.947
BEING GENERATED NOW. LET ME

01:54:48.014 --> 01:54:49.782
JUST ALSO ADD THAT. I WE

01:54:49.849 --> 01:54:51.517
TARGETING TWO PARTICULAR

01:54:51.584 --> 01:54:53.286
SCENARIOS NUMBER ONE ODD

01:54:53.353 --> 01:54:55.588
SCENARIO WITH A SITUATION WHERE

01:54:55.655 --> 01:54:56.589
THE INFORMATION IS BEING

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:58.324
COLLECTED BY THAT'S A DIVISIVE

01:54:58.391 --> 01:55:00.793
FITBIT. AND THEN TRANSMITTED TO

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.262
ANOTHER PERSON FOR USE LET'S

01:55:02.328 --> 01:55:04.464
SEE A DOCTOR. NOW THAT

01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:05.064
INFORMATION IS NOT COVER UNDER

01:55:05.131 --> 01:55:08.001
CLIA. NOW THE OTHER SCENARIO IS

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:10.203
THAT LET'S SAY IF A COP AND-

01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:11.938
APPLICATION COLLECTS A LOT OF

01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:13.606
INFORMATION FROM YOU ME AND

01:55:13.673 --> 01:55:17.443
EVERYBODY. ELSE AND THREE.

01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:18.778
AGGREGATE DOT DATA FOR EXAMPLE

01:55:18.845 --> 01:55:20.280
CREATE A DATABASE THAT CONTAINS

01:55:20.346 --> 01:55:22.048
EVERYBODY'S. INFORMATION LIKE

01:55:22.115 --> 01:55:23.816
HEART RATE OR BREATHING RATE

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:25.351
AND THAT INFORMATION CAN BE

01:55:25.418 --> 01:55:28.221
SOLD. TO SOMEBODY ELSE WITHOUT

01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:29.856
OUR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. AND

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:31.357
THAT'S THE SECOND SCENARIO THAT

01:55:31.424 --> 01:55:32.759
WE WANT TO DRESS AND THAT'S

01:55:32.825 --> 01:55:34.761
HAPPENING ALL ALREADY LET ME

01:55:34.827 --> 01:55:35.628
SEE IF I COULD SHARE A COUPLE

01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:39.265
OF EXAMPLES WITH YOU. ACCORDING

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:41.567
TO A RECENT STUDY. OUR THE

01:55:41.634 --> 01:55:44.103
SURVEY LIKE THIRTY SIX TOP RANK

01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:46.239
APPLICATION FOR DEPRESSION AND

01:55:46.306 --> 01:55:49.342
SMOKING CESSATION. PROGRAMS OF

01:55:49.409 --> 01:55:51.611
THE THIRTY SIX TWENTY NINE OF

01:55:51.678 --> 01:55:53.379
THEM TRANSMITTED TO DATA TO

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:55.081
SERVICES PROVIDED BY FACEBOOK

01:55:55.148 --> 01:55:57.317
OR GOOGLE. WITHOUT US KNOWING

01:55:57.383 --> 01:55:59.152
IT SO THEY ALREADY AGGREGATED

01:55:59.218 --> 01:56:00.720
THE DATA AND THEN DECIDED TO

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:01.954
KIND OF SHARE THAT INFORMATION

01:56:02.021 --> 01:56:03.256
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE WITHOUT US

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:05.224
KNOWING T. THE OTHER SITUATION

01:56:05.291 --> 01:56:07.827
IS OUT. THERE WAS AN INSURER.

01:56:07.894 --> 01:56:09.929
DOT ACTUALLY OBTAINED THREE

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:12.665
MILLION PEOPLES INFORMATION

01:56:12.732 --> 01:56:13.232
MEDICAL INFORMATION FROM AN

01:56:13.299 --> 01:56:15.335
AGGREGATOR. SUIT SO THIS IS

01:56:15.401 --> 01:56:17.303
HAPPENING YOU KNOW ALREADY SO

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:18.204
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:20.006
KNOW- IN THE FUTURE SO THIS IS

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:21.441
HAPPENING THE DATA IS BEING

01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:22.375
SHARED WITH OTHER PEOPLE

01:56:22.442 --> 01:56:23.710
WITHOUT US KNOWING IT SIMPLY

01:56:23.776 --> 01:56:24.711
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE

01:56:24.777 --> 01:56:26.245
DATA IS BEING COLLECTED BY A

CHAMBER QUESTIONS COMMENTS

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:33.252
CENTER MORICHES. AMERICA HAS A

02:06:33.319 --> 02:06:35.354
VERY LIBERAL HISTORY WHEN IT

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:38.590
COMES TO- NAME CHANGES OTHER

02:06:38.657 --> 02:06:41.527
PARTS OF THE WORLD- THE NAME

02:06:41.593 --> 02:06:43.395
THAT YOU WERE GIVEN AT BIRTH IS

02:06:43.462 --> 02:06:44.196
THE NAME THAT YOU HAVE IN

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:47.766
PERPETUITY. WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY

02:06:47.833 --> 02:06:49.568
FOR LEGAL NAME CHANGE SO

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:51.971
AMERICA I THINK IS HAS A VERY

02:06:52.037 --> 02:06:55.040
UNIQUE- TRADITION WITH ALL THE

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:56.642
LEGAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ALLOWS

02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:58.677
SOMEONE TO CHANGE THEIR NAME.

02:06:58.744 --> 02:07:00.012
MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL I

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:01.680
THINK I UNDERSTAND THE

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:06.151
MOTIVATION FOR DOING IT IS- WHY

02:07:06.218 --> 02:07:09.421
WOULDN'T YOU. WISH FOR PLEASE

02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:11.256
POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL

02:07:11.323 --> 02:07:14.760
INSTITUTION- TO. MAKE THESE

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:16.762
ACCOMMODATIONS AFTER A LEGAL

02:07:16.829 --> 02:07:19.231
NAME CHANGE. IF I COULD POSE

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:20.532
THAT AND THEN FOLLOW UP THERE

02:07:20.599 --> 02:07:22.735
AFTER THE STRUCTURE HI SALOON

02:07:22.801 --> 02:07:26.171
OR CHIP SO- SO FIRST OF ALL ON

02:07:26.238 --> 02:07:27.172
THE ONE HAND I THINK I HEARD

02:07:27.239 --> 02:07:30.609
YOU SAY THAT- THAT THE NAMES

02:07:30.676 --> 02:07:32.578
ARE CHANGED AROUND THE WORLD ON

02:07:32.644 --> 02:07:33.145
A FREQUENT BASIS AND THAT IS

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:35.214
ENTIRELY TRUE. PART OF THE

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:36.415
CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:37.282
DRESS WITH THIS BILL IS THAT

02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:39.385
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COLLEGES

02:07:39.451 --> 02:07:41.220
THAT HAVE MADE MAKING RECORDS

02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:43.022
ACCESSIBLE IN REVISING THEM

02:07:43.088 --> 02:07:45.024
DIFFICULT NOT ALL BUT SOME AND

02:07:45.090 --> 02:07:46.458
SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:47.493
MUCH MORE PREDICTABLE MUCH

02:07:47.559 --> 02:07:50.429
EASIER- TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

02:07:50.496 --> 02:07:52.131
WHY DON'T WE ASK FOLKS TO GET A

02:07:52.197 --> 02:07:54.466
LEGAL CHANGE- IT'S ACTUALLY

02:07:54.533 --> 02:07:56.568
QUITE EXPENSIVE SO IT COSTS-

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:58.170
USUALLY OVER FOUR HUNDRED

02:07:58.237 --> 02:07:59.571
THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS TO GET A

02:07:59.638 --> 02:08:01.640
NAME CHANGE BORDER- AND IT

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:02.775
TAKES TIME TO USE THAT LEGAL

02:08:02.841 --> 02:08:04.977
PROCESS AND- YOU KNOW FROM FROM

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:06.445
OUR PERSPECTIVE I THINK.

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:08.247
REQUIRING A STUDENT TO PAY THAT

02:08:08.313 --> 02:08:09.281
ADDITIONAL MONEY JUST TO BE

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:10.716
RECOGNIZED BY THE COLLEGE THAT

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:12.317
THEY WENT TO SCHOOL AS A PERSON

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:14.686
THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE- IS A

02:08:14.753 --> 02:08:16.155
BIT TO ASK- AND SO WE'RE HOPING

02:08:16.221 --> 02:08:19.558
TO MAKE IT SIMPLE- AND- AND DO

02:08:19.625 --> 02:08:21.693
WHAT WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:26.065
WITH REGARDS TO K. TWELVE-

02:08:26.131 --> 02:08:27.166
TRANSCRIPTS AND DIPLOMAS. THE

02:08:27.232 --> 02:08:29.068
CARD AND I'M TRYING TO. I THINK

02:08:29.134 --> 02:08:30.769
I UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:33.172
BEHIND IT I'M HAVING. I'M

02:08:33.238 --> 02:08:36.341
HAVING TROUBLE FIGURING OUT HOW

02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:37.709
MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT FURTHER

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:39.912
ON WHAT PROTECTIONS WOULD BE IN

02:08:39.978 --> 02:08:44.583
PLACE- TO AVOID FRAUD BECAUSE

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:46.051
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE IT SEEMS

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:47.686
AS IF YOU HAVE THIS TYPE OF

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:51.557
FLEXIBILITY. TO- TO HAVE NAMES

02:08:51.623 --> 02:08:53.992
MOVE WITH MESSAGE FREQUENCY

02:08:54.059 --> 02:08:55.961
POTENTIALLY THAT THERE COULD

02:08:56.028 --> 02:08:59.064
BE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:00.799
MISREPRESENTATION OR FRAUD CAN

02:09:00.866 --> 02:09:02.835
YOU. GO INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:05.504
OF UNIVERSITIES HAVE PROCEDURES

02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:07.639
TO FOR SOMEONE TO GO AND SAY

02:09:07.706 --> 02:09:09.842
WHO THEY ARE SO- TYPICALLY THEY

02:09:09.908 --> 02:09:11.043
WOULD REQUIRE A SOCIAL SECURITY

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:12.511
NUMBER THEY WOULD REQUIRE

02:09:12.578 --> 02:09:13.879
INFORMATION ABOUT AN ADDRESS

02:09:13.946 --> 02:09:15.881
INFORMATION THAT TYPICALLY ONLY

02:09:15.948 --> 02:09:18.617
THE GRADUATE WITH NO- AND SO

02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:21.520
THAT'S ASKED BEFORE YOU CAN

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:22.387
CHANGE YOUR NAME FROM NAME

02:09:22.454 --> 02:09:23.021
EIGHT TO NINETY. PARTS OF I'M

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:26.058
AN EMPLOYER. AND SO AND SO IS

02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:27.526
APPLYING FOR THE JOB AND I'M

02:09:27.593 --> 02:09:29.528
DOING A BACKGROUND CHECK. IN

02:09:29.595 --> 02:09:32.264
THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS- HAS HAS

02:09:32.331 --> 02:09:36.335
MODIFIED THEIR- IDENTIFIERS-

02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:37.669
WHAT IS IT THE CHECK AND

02:09:37.736 --> 02:09:40.139
BALANCE THAT WOULD OCCUR WHEN

02:09:40.205 --> 02:09:42.908
THE NAME ON THE DIPLOMA. OR THE

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:44.209
RESUME CORRESPONDING TO THE

02:09:44.276 --> 02:09:45.844
DIPLOMA IS DIFFERENT FROM THE

02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:47.813
INITIAL SCHOOL RECORD OR WOULD

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:48.814
IT CHANGE THE INITIAL SCHOOL

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:50.782
RECORD AS WELL. WELLA PART OF

02:09:50.849 --> 02:09:51.984
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:52.985
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:09:53.051 --> 02:09:54.553
INDIVIDUALS AREN'T OUTED IN THE

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:56.155
WORKPLACE SO IDEALLY THE

02:09:56.221 --> 02:09:58.023
EMPLOYER DOESN'T KNOW THAT

02:09:58.090 --> 02:09:59.424
SOMEONE HAD A NAME CHANGE THE

02:09:59.491 --> 02:10:01.627
REAL ISSUE IS- WHAT IS THE NAME

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:02.694
ON THE DIPLOMA OR THE NAME OF

02:10:02.761 --> 02:10:04.229
THE TRANSCRIPT THAT REFLECTS.

02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:06.832
THE PERSON'S NAME TODAY AND SO

02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:07.432
THE ISSUE AROUND FRAUD IS JUST

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:09.668
MAKING SURE THAT- THAT THAT

02:10:09.735 --> 02:10:11.970
THAT GRADUATE THAT STUDENT. IS

02:10:12.037 --> 02:10:14.439
ABLE TO- PREFER THEY ARE TO THE

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:15.407
UNIVERSITY THAT THEY ARE THE

02:10:15.474 --> 02:10:17.442
STUDENT- THAT HAD A DIFFERENT

02:10:17.509 --> 02:10:19.845
NAME SOME YEARS BACK- THAT NAME

02:10:19.912 --> 02:10:21.513
GETS CHANGED THE TRANSCRIPT OF

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:23.215
THE DIPLOMA. REFLECTS THAT

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:25.217
INNOCENT TO THE EMPLOYER SO

02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:26.919
THAT'S NOT TYPICALLY AN ISSUE

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:31.056
THAT- THAT THAT AN EMPLOYER

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:31.623
WOULD. WOULD HAVE TO GRAPPLE

02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:36.728
WITH. OKAY ONCE AGAIN I THINK-

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:38.964
I THINK THERE ARE MECHANISMS IN

02:10:39.031 --> 02:10:39.865
PLACE I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE

02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:42.801
WOULD WANT IF THEY HAVE CHOSEN

02:10:42.868 --> 02:10:46.071
AN ANSWER RIGHT TO REPRESENT

02:10:46.138 --> 02:10:46.972
THEMSELVES IN ANY FASHION THEY

02:10:47.039 --> 02:10:49.074
SEE FIT BUT FROM A LEGAL

02:10:49.141 --> 02:10:51.810
STANDPOINT- I THINK WE ALSO

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.946
HAVE TO HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS

02:10:54.012 --> 02:10:56.548
FEDERAL BIT MORE SECURE AND MY

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:58.317
LAST IS WHAT IS THIS PERTAINING

02:10:58.383 --> 02:11:01.620
ONLY TO. PUBLIC POST SECONDARY.

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:03.222
AND YES THIS AUTO WRITER THIS

02:11:03.288 --> 02:11:04.356
BILL WOULD APPLY TO PUBLIC

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:06.191
UNIVERSITIES HAVE YOU SEIZE THE

02:11:06.258 --> 02:11:08.327
CS USING COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IN

02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:10.896
THE PIVATE IS NOT. UNDER THIS

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:12.998
UMBRELLA THAT IS CORRECT CAN

02:11:13.065 --> 02:11:15.334
YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT THAT'S THE

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:18.337
CASE- DID. THAT IS THAT IS HOW

02:11:18.403 --> 02:11:21.240
WE DRAFTED IT- WE WEREN'T. WE

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:21.907
AREN'T IMPOSING THIS ON PRIVATE

02:11:21.974 --> 02:11:23.709
INSTITUTIONS WERE ASKING THE

02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:25.377
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TO- TO STEP

02:11:25.444 --> 02:11:27.446
UP AS WE DID WITH PUBLICATION

02:11:27.512 --> 02:11:29.114
TWELVE SCHOOLS. ARE ALL IN WITH

02:11:29.181 --> 02:11:31.250
THIS I HAD MY MIDDLE NAME IS

NAME. AND NOBODY WOULD DO IT.

02:11:42.261 --> 02:11:43.462
THEY INSISTED ON MAKING CERTAIN

02:11:43.528 --> 02:11:46.565
THAT- THE DIPLOMA WAS AS IT WAS

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:48.367
SOME INSTITUTIONS WILL ALSO

02:11:48.433 --> 02:11:52.904
ONLY ISSUE YOU ONE DIPLOMA. AND

02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:54.339

MAY WANT TO BRING UP. OUR LOOK

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:11.189
INTO- WHETHER THESE PUBLIC

INSTITUTIONS HAVE THOSE TYPES

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:14.493
OF POLICIES ARE IN THE ISSUANCE

02:12:14.559 --> 02:12:16.728

THANK YOU AND I THINK WHAT I

02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:20.299
WOULD SUGGEST IN RESPONSE TO

02:12:20.365 --> 02:12:22.434
THAT I THINK THE IDEA THAT. YOU

02:12:22.501 --> 02:12:23.302

FOLKS. FROM THAT GROUP AND IT

02:27:40.518 --> 02:27:42.253
SOUNDED LIKE. BECAUSE THERE'S A

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:43.621
LOT OF DIMENSION TO THIS AND I

02:27:43.688 --> 02:27:44.222

ACTIVITIES THAT I COULD BE

02:28:02.206 --> 02:28:03.507
