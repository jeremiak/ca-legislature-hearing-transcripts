and I wanted to first of all welcome everyone here to this hearing I it's been several years since the California legislature has taken up this topic and it seems appropriate for us to re engage when I was appointed chair of the banking committee at the beginning of twenty eighteen big coin was trading at a all time high relative to the U. S. dollar. I was hearing stories about a surprising number of people buying bit coin is some of whom I would have never expected to be interested in virtual currencies. I would also hear stories about people falling victim to fraudulent practices by hackers or or French companies in the industry. As the price a bit coin fluctuated some of the media attention around virtual currencies. At subsided. Then this summer. Face an ounce this plant caliber. And once again media attention it refocused on the relatively new and interesting and interest based in our financial markets. Well the media attention has and didn't load. Had conversations with colleagues in the legislature and the state's financial regulator. When it is plain the proper role. In virtual currency activities and I think this is a difficult question. Some of these appear to fall and the purview of our federal securities regulator the securities and exchange commission. Other activity your to fall under the purview arrestees finance regulator department of business oversight. And still other activities do. Clearly fall under the purview of any existing federal or state laws. While I have had a number of companies come to my office to explain can use your own state laws some of them ask for very. Occasions to be provided I the new laws. My colleague. Leader cal on has introduced number of bills related block. Business over the past few years this year he introduced assembly bill four nine which proposes a uniform law firm states across the country should be regulating virtual currency businesses. To be clear the committee well the ladies will not be taking any action on that fill up or any other bills to date this is just a description. It is believed to a former all the relevant issue. Now with the right to act on the ledges as the legislature reconvenes in Sacramento. Is hearing the will hear the perspective that businesses and users the interact. Virtual currency markets today. We also state regular regulatory ext on the recommendation how California should be position today both businesses and users a virtual currency is can help the market place. I will now turn over my time to majority leader Ian Calderon a who is the chair of the committee on technology technological advances. Thank you manager when I cant thank you for a- assembly district we're very proud of real Honda and so proud that we were able to host this event. This hearing he today at this great location. Or you start with my. Remark I just wanna say that I'm more on these issues. Much as I possibly can. I'd are blotching working group to get a start being at. Hi this past week with the organizer of the block. What we want out of the- group that you know as a analysts at least my perspective l√† I want to see what the reports when we deliver that report to the legislature I am really about all the different possibilities and today we're talking about one facet of you know the of watching technology which is you know that the more central facet of action technology when it comes digital currency but there are a lot of different applications when it comes to that technology. Real I were able to start for a lot more attention on this topic. I innovative plays a role. In pants economies in it is necessary for long term. Growth as the fifth largest economy in the world. Investing in technology fostering innovation means credit to cal economic prosperity this is the on technological techno. Dance is with this year sure that California's ready dot utilized. Rap the emerging technology with the help of industry experts such as experts. Have you. We will be able to understand best practices with the state government a businesses identify potential benefits. To legal patience the bill and we have to ask ourselves is how can we preserve our leadership in the world in in a- techno. And provide opportunity is to our own citizens take part in new innovative a copy. Fostering innovation. Requires creating a competitive bid. Firemen getting pop thank innovation. This is why care eight twenty six fifty eight and twenty eighteen a measure that the final chain and created working. To explore how our stake in from the deployment of blockchain. I knew that I know that it will two five. The Tory. Technology can ensure the goal of the blockchain working group is to develop a legislative and regulatory. The record stations on California can courage innovation. And invest in this technology as it is crews will take well Gee usage. Current I want. I wanted introduced them but before I do that I'm I would like our estimate if you can just come up really quickly to them phoning a couple brief remarks he is from real hundred college and he is our. The Majority Leader Calderon and thank you for just under college. Share the mon. Panelists. On behalf of the real Han real on a call unity wanna thank you for here we are happy. Post the Civic Center and hearing Charlie months. The fed ex. Chance to see democracy up close to hear about federalism up close and to be able to understand what our role is the virtual currency and we're very grateful they're going to be hearing. The business at the of the consumer perspective in the rate the purpose of as well and so on behalf of a doctor to yes Sir we welcome you and- doctor Reyes. And so if he does. Sure to in some the staff I want him to enter of flow. I wanna make sure to let you know. He will milliliter today any sense regard as the other poor fifties and I'll just finish up about housekeeping I. Is what legend but we have a water in the back. And if you have any questions about the facility. Here the whole time right here up here in the corner again I'm Russell casting a- stricter governments in committee relations. I thank everyone for being here today. A path over the majority county. Just how many here today. And if your student thank you students from being here we applaud you. And we're so that you can be informing yourself and you'll be here when imagine the. Thanks Russell I appreciate that now I'd like to welcome our first panel. The perspective of the business we have alley Medina is the exact direction. Out of a coalition Brian Brooks who is the chief legal officer corps. And Stuart elder elderly. They say that right. All the ready general cal at rebel. Thank you so much for having us here trailer down in the majority around and also thank you so much this college for hosting us. I am the director of the blockchain advocacy coalition and a former community college to California myself I'm looking out to see co Litt formed about a year ago when a group mailbox the current is in the. Bay area realize there is no prize advocacy after. Street in the state. Of. An industry to give high level overview of what it looks like California. Hundred and thirty four block. State which sounds like really healthy growth once you compare that to the global increase which went up three and a half times over the same time period so last year the United States the seven point 2% a global market share in California accounted for nearly 12% What has twenty. 9% California has dropped to under 10% of the global market share. Virtual currency. Her that against other. California mostly hold around 2225% of the global market share across other tech industries which means we have a disproportionately small amount the blockchain cryptocurrency community here and you look at her I did that's an ongoing trend since two thousand twelve with the law market share compared. Global a critical. More consistently losing the industry. Point probably Facebook's libra that and maybe the business analyst. Is a lot of other products being California the to use this technology for example propping. Streamlined the transactions on blockchain Vegas creating your identity platforms. Last year IBM and sweet I. What did areas that are over drafted from offers to trade water on blockchain and platforms the vast majority of businesses in the state are not extremely large I did two thirds of them have ten or fewer and fees and the median funding of two point five million dollars. The industry average for tech companies and four point five million dollars for compare. You will have an over represent. And the reason is pretty obvious it's regulatory uncertainty. Okay Stanley report indicated that the greatest predictor of where a blockchain a virtual currency business will locate is. We don't have thirty nine states. Definitions. Level aye CCC's that security to see it. Currency the IRS tax that at the property in addition to obtaining necessary even federal licenses companies that wish to engage the entire place have to comply with licensing requirements all fifty states. This is. An inordinate amount start ups resources and time. There's those requirements really onerous them into Mrs bit license new York's two thousand fifteen bill the first three years of the BET license program only five companies actually obtained a license to operate in the state of New York. They make the DMB look expeditious. Headlines about agreed the queen accidents and many companies chose to leave the state rather than pushing a regulatory bottleneck. In Washington two thousand seven they passed SB fifty thirty one. Companies again by the leave the state of Washington record look into states like Colorado for example issues that were cited were on the bonding requirements in data collection require pretty more of a security hazard the consumer protection. Blocking businesses leave our state country they mostly get your hands are placed as- one does California company to register. You bring government entered watching companies and investment aggressively their taxation agency is proposing to drop their step percent. In services tax on project is a virtual card. He's ordered of con. They all I never clear fine which specifically digital assets presenting and please contact. When a different billion asset tokens. Please with this remark and recently with the banking license recorder company not a country standards if que YCA under your- anti money what. Clear is the tracking business as in April of this year taxes please guidance for virtual currency companies to the crypto currencies as currently implemented cannot be considered money or money teary value under their money services. It goes on the clerk I. exactly which sorts of this is might be considered a money transmitter and which sorts. I'm currently this are not clear. Extremely helpful. Culp but meant Montana Wyoming. Actually a lot of blockchain register legislation recently I'll have the difference between tell the tokens and other asset types. Okay I'm this is a step towards the structures that we see in Singapore and sweat better track of and he- came business says. So I would applauded. Engaging in a complex world regulate. I'm and this bill they were talking today eight. For more commission supplemental act it's all been introduced in states like Nevada Hawaii and Oklahoma it currently is based blocking all of those states. The goal of streamlining reciprocal licensing system across state. Being able to apply just for one license across all fifty states we get significan easy. To operate in the US and reach US customers. However passed that only when you're the plan for state specially month and a to be honest on the top of any business use less. Have a customer base is not going to do with. Now even if possible for states it would. Still because I am a signature. Block California this is the find these requirements too onerous to comply with. I'm gonna read comparison she to the committee of state parks and rec since tech. Compare against plans in New York as well as others require. Here's some things I think. For the K. sure. That are. Already has a look since our money transfer. State would also apply license if it covers their business. And should be clear five I it. To this day consider defining there's a lot of fun to regulate them separately as others. Have done our wallets transaction. Under this framework second capture a ton of business as- are the surety bond in personal wealth requirements prohibitive to small businesses I know there's a five thousand dollar exemption in the bill that is that small amount in two. Rooms of the state I don't know the companies I would be able to take advantage of that successfully. It are the. Consumer protect living. Tend to security risk in this industry. So thank you so much for your attention I look for to engage on this bill with you throughout the next year. Thank you all right now we will hear from Brian Brooks is chief legal officer from going. Well up the first of all let me think a little Calderon and surely for convening this really timely and important hearing. Mister Alvarez for coming from start to talk about the regulatory perspective I think this is a group and- just. Have it. I want to let three messages of this morning in just a few minutes first of All I Want to land the message that. This is not a small industry. I often people from my of traditional to believe the tub blockchain encrypt. Each side. We should be very careful about what problems are trying to solve. And then finally I want to echo alleys comments there is a co op unity for California to lead. In in fact it's a little bit of a travesty California which birth this industry. Leader. The little girl talk a little bit about those things when you start with the first point that this is not a small industry so the market cap of crypto currencies globally as. Of yesterday was brown two hundred twenty five billion dollars that's not a large amount to the banking assets in the world a relic right to circulating fiat currencies but the- street. To exist ten years ago and now the- that's today. It is true that bit coin is off of its all time high and yet bit coin alone has returned a two hundred and fifty percent investment return in twenty nineteen alone. That outstrips. The next aspect by a factor of roughly. Right and there about two thousand crypto currency. This is not a small industry. And my company is not a small company so coin company. Accounts that's right double the number of accounts Charles Schwab to get of comparison so of for people. Over a certain age like he points a little bit weird virtually. Any in the under thirty said. Many of them have a. When they saw one we've completed a hundred fifty dollars of asset trades in our. Seven years of existence we have eight hundred four years we have twenty billion dollars of. I and we have a per. The US Dahle. Out which is a top twenty five token with four hundred and seventy five million units in circulation fully backed by dollar at in US FDIC insured banks the point is well we made. Early is we are not completely mature. This is not a small business. Me talk a little bit about mark torture. Action in the world crypto you have to the little out where this fits the sting financial regulation and I begin with you give it most financial regulation is back on right wing intermediaries so by. Placing his large. Banks not about. Tumors and so we regulate intermediaries same thing is regular we largely a rate issuers and. Broker dealers we regulate that's right. Broker dealers who you from every security. What's and understand in the world of crypto the mission of crypto technology is to remove it Aries one emphasized remove intermediaries. See crypto es to banks what email to the east office right there was a time when the only information to other people and- go through a single central. Pay them a lot of money and we long for the- purpose of. The letter and then one half. So with Val the point of crypto currency ultimately is by our me to try exact with Allie in a way that doesn't the bank doesn't touch a broker dealer the mission we based give these assets out into the ecosystem so. Joint mice work. But I see the. In crypto is about get rid of intermediaries that's the- so having that let me talk about regulatory structure and the environment in which we find ourselves today the- switch the legislature is considering. What is. This is not a light we regulated industry as alley mentioned we have regulation by most multiple federal regulators who quite active in space protect both can send investors I start with this exchange commission with delays. Which asset. In that matter because yes it is a secure. Closure from the asset issuers so that they understand what they're buying what effort the man at and T. as providing and how that might rise and fall in value in the future. The SEC also regulates changes it requires that exchanges provide certain protections for people who are trading on the platform to make sure the assets are. Be traced can be the best execution basis. Addition hold your assets to make sure that the assets don't go missing. One issue we have today which I talk about in my written submission has to do with the clarity or lack of clarity the SEC level. And there are some things the commission's been very clear about and others have been less clear ample. Toto concert qualify as securities. The queen bass took the lead just a few weeks ago establishing an industry group called the creek rating council. And the crypto reading cancel has built score. To operationalize see guidance and to help make clearer to. Which. Sharp black could not be securities so I think Rivas. You can do on that front. The federal commodity if you can commission also regulates other ask crypto as does the federal trade on the consumer protections. In each of its agencies has a good serve pursued investor protection and consumer protection issues. Found them. I say this is because it would be a mistake to believe that this is an unregulated or lightly regulated industry where people are getting away with murder. In fact SEC announces lawsuits against crypto project developers almost weekly where they see scams and they purposely done where they've been informed of projects in cat. Values so we're not legislating in a vacuum here. At the state level the story is a little different. At the state level what we have is straight. Gold to be of different regulation laws across. Areas it's- it's have money. License that. Certain say act. This licenses the governor to come like mine can make margin loans to allow by crypto currencies. The states have tried licenses that separately gov. The opportunity. In this kind of a tangled regulatory climate. We would argue a coin bass what is needed California. To lead is not another later of chin on top of regulation that are you this California does the transmission law to have banking laws and other laws that of. Where California could. New York state because New York currently is the hub of Creek deregulation at their fourth is California could do to get the industry back to this. The first. Single charter which which group. Major activities trading. Of those act to be done cal today except each of those requires a sprint. And licenses granted and supervised by the same regular. Please supervised by the seat by the by. Second New York is made the mistake of issuing licenses that don't our licensees to do a thing. Let me just say that again don't allow licensees to do anything. In New York when a company but license it can't trade a simple crypt occurrences until it sec it's approval. This can be done Carter. And that we're ready will I assure you drop. Yeah and my company to draw more business work in the morning. Find out next let. Charter and next custody powers side of the- to sing. In by the B. B. O. that level of clarity would allow my business to move faster and it would allow the. Doing so the and private so just are really. With industry on these kinds of issues and I am confident within the bill's existing authority things can be done. Let me just say one last word before I promise. I will shut up that should draw applause right. The virtual currency this act we have engage with the you're talking mission over the last two or three years I am pleased. This have taken some up to just. But we can't believe that what is required is not a nother layer of regulation alright to pull. Elation. If the legislature seriously considers act we urge three things one is make sure that you are already since their money. In or H. some sort separately require. The license under. Second to the except there are collateral requirements in the in the currency business act please make sure that the collateral. Matches the one trading with. Crypto trade. By fiat currency for obvious quality the reasons and find me say that are fundamental issue. This is act idea that this thing should be run article eight CC article eight of the sea. Security not securities does of the securities laws so the confusion that would be created. Square peg round hole securities laws will create unintended consequences both for the securities market and the market thanks for having this record really appreciate the- to be here. Thank you Brian. But that to get to you Stuart elderly who the general counsel for rebel. Man I'm sure phone and Majority Leader Calderon indistinct member to the committee and select committee thank you for the opportunity to are you today. Do already unchecked reform. Apple is a global enterprise blockchain company headquartered in San Francisco we have actual products in commercial you. We're working with not against regulators governments and central banks their the world to improve the way the world moves my. Rebels global payments network includes over two hundred customers across forty could use and so on. Rippling Jan here yeah over three decades practiced law in New York where I was a partner with a global law firm in where I held their leadership positions. Accounts are roles with financial institute. In such as American Express HSBC. It is our firm belief having a- pourtant for innovation in this space to flourish bringing industry participants consumer advocates and regulators together as you've done today. Is precisely what is needed to reach. To that end we believe there's no better place to this cop to take place than California. As the birth. And must many of the start ups that at the heart of the- every day line. Cap understands well the promise challenges that new technology can hold. It's recently established blockchain working group but one ample of how California is using to take a leadership role and reckless how to be part of that working group. And this is why we are so very not to sure. Given the potential transit permitted impact that it in these tech she's. Particularly in the space not only first since of California but world why is needed first days global payment system is well off taking days please. The quickest way for me to send. To place it in a suitcase drive to LA airport and physically take it with me to the test. Second the proper says expense. Average globally currency conversion fee and is equal approx proximally 7% of the total amount three medic finally cross border. You're free to. Little communication invisibility to either the sender or the recipient of the file. Blockchain technology and digital assets can change that by enabling faster cheaper and more trade and payment systems. Rep net space we do what to buy. Quiddity solution use virtual currency called X. P. and that the British to facilitate fiat. Sanctions. Partner with bank financial institutions including payment provide first to remedy the final. Across for payments. In the Civic student wiretaps to displace or replace fiat currency or compete with central. And the rest mention report works with regulators got. Banks globally to improve the way the world moves money so what this means California. It is currently estimated that approximately eight hundred. For one in nine are the recipients of funds sent home by migrant. As many of you are person where California news home to multiple counties were migrant workers who are in any in threes in from our culture to technology. Comprise more third of your could stick including and to Clara San Francisco. Matteo reporter specific so the banks financial institutions in payment providers can help immigrants send money home cheaply and efficiently where can then be to cover living essentials even where remittances represent a small portion of what a migrant. These funds once. And a lifeline for millions and lease worldwide. To date as may invite alley and Brian neither Congress nor US regulatory agencies have established a clear regulatory framework for assets. The space is ripe for leading states like California said a workable policy that would provide an example for us. And regulators to follow. Framework we believe it start with token taxonomy a clear and simple category patient of tokens defining whether can is for example a since he security token does the token represent company is the token until the token the token right access to color service for a reward or is it a payments token that helps bridge payments and remittances. Or perhaps a simple story value like to goal. With that clear to content on a me as a foundation the history. Public and the regulators with which digital and small. Regular you can then figure out which existing laws apply to which took an asset class for example. Which token should be regulated under securities law with the track. How. Asian supply how to protection laws apply any to in Texarkana me should retain flexibility recognizing the fact that digital assets can and do move between classifications overtime as technologies evolve taking steps along these lines as the United Kingdom has switch one hand Singapore have. They've all done this recently have all done this quickly one not only foster innovation and protect consumers but it will how California to continue to recruit new company. And promote emerging technology use that poster and as as a world class destination. And will bring the jobs tax rates that will follow. If that does happen there is a real risk and we're already seeing it technology will simply move all your. California has already started the process of trying to provide direction introduction of a- teen eighty nine. We believe that their study of legislation and any amendments. Paul we need to. Innovation. Thus this dialogue and conversation we're having today is important and again we appreciate the opportunity to be part of it with you thank you Sir appreciate everybody's customizer removes a couple questions and. Number loan if you wanna start. So thank you all for that presentation I'm gonna start with a ripple in queen base can you each discuss the cost involved. Applying for a bit license in New York and also if you can talk just a little bit about the legal expertise that it may or may not have required I'm in the process for companies. Sure well so I I'm happy to start on that question the answer is that it took us more than twelve months of time. And it took us to global law firms worth of legal resources at an average hourly rate of twelve hundred dollars an hour. To get through that process and in in terms of the total dollar cost out of pocket to service providers I can't tell you that other than to say it was in the seven figures just to get the license. But I think of things not in terms of price I think I'm of them in terms of value for money and so it so again the message I would want to land with the committee. Is that once we had spent the millions of dollars and the twelve months of time we had a license that didn't allow us to do anything and so the average time it has taken us to get approval of each individual crypto token that we try to trade under that license. Is between three and six months which means for most tokens we add on our platform we initially have to geo fence New York which is our primary licensing state. And only offer that took in the other forty nine states so that's a little bit of a crazy model right a- lot of time for no authority. I saw all echo what Brian said ripple I think was the second or third. It license granted in New York state I think it was the first so first pet license offered for an actual commercial use case. On the time and expense and needed. To get that licenses just as Brian described. Subsequent to getting that bit license. We are subject to annual audits. By the state of New York. On in each of those audits come with said a scaling up of requirements of first it's a baseline of a baseline complain structure. Which act which actually in many ways is a good thing you would want your company to have that. But then. I each order brings with it a new set of requirements and each new set of requirements seem to be. Further removed from the business. That was initial licensed in the first place. So while in many ways I do. Log the department financial services in New York. For being the first to lean into the space. I think over the many years since the bit licenses have been available. There are a lot of lessons to be learned. From the state's going forward and I think if the department. Of services representatives. Were here. Today he said the same thing. This is a follow up to that gonna had talked a little bit more about the to from law commission. Process in the third panel. Your companies were involved with its with that process and- do you have a sense about how rigorous that process will be and- also the impact it will have to companies of different sizes and I guess that that's really where I'm leading to try to understand. Not all companies are the same size they can't all have. They don't have the same resources to move forward in a process like this I'm trying to get a sense of how realistic this will be for the long range of companies that are out there in the space. Not so I think that's a terrific question and- what I would say is the impact on companies of various sizes depends on how clear it is. That existing licensees are exempt right so at point base. We're currently licensed in forty six states with existing money transmitter licenses. And if it turned out that we did separate we need to apply for this license that I would argue that states that have that requirement would be at a disadvantage for our business because were already license we have a- Trust Company New York. License in New York money transmitter licenses virtually every other place. If this was an alternative licensing path then I think the issue is a little bit different a little bit less onerous. But what I would urge on the committee is. If it's an alternative license there's a real risk of regulatory arbitrage as companies the side mmhm do I want a money transmitter license. Or do I want the virtual currency business act license and that kind of regulatory competition has had issues and other sectors for example in banking were the thrift rate. For the weakest regulators and that's what people want. So as I think that there are pros and cons to it but I think the existing license fees would be concerned. About the need for another license to conduct the same business. So the only thing I would add. I'm sherry is that. I think your question gets to the balance of. To the cost and burden. Or the risk reward of appropriate regulation. And while I think D√¢n well funded and mature companies like windows and rebel. On can afford to go through that process and Weber talking about here is innovation. And I think younger and smaller companies simply cannot on which stand. The cost and the burden of going through a very robust. Licensing regime which is why much of this innovation is moving offshore. That's why I go back to the theme of a clear token taxonomy. A categorization of what the business is in what. Is the very purpose of the token. I think once you have a clear token taxonomy than can look at the- inventories of launch that currently exist. And I think what you will find is the currently inventory of Los that currently exist when our probably apply to clear definitions. Suffices and you don't actually need an additional layer of. Costly and burdensome burdensome. Licensing requirements. That. Many simply would not be able to afford to go through the process. And Allie I just wanted to see if you can chime in specifically on the license you work with a lot of entrepreneurs in the industry if you can chime in. On reactions to a licensing processing in California. I really got into main reactions so my board members already have lenders licenses and are in the process of a plane from any transmitter licenses. Their little aghast at the concept of having to go through another extremely rigorous licensing process on top of are already very thorough money transfer licensing requirements in the state. I'm in said they were. There really really hoping that they would not to later this on top as has been mentioned by the other panelists that another layer of regulation it would cause in these businesses to leave the state. The smaller start ups and entrepreneurs will not be able to attain this license as currently written on the- none of them have licenses in New York. It's just not feasible for them financially. Over the last. I would say months I've become more increasingly Mary to the idea of developing a single singular regulatory body specific to this interest industry in the state of California because when I look at what other states are doing when I look at the federal government is doing when it comes to any business certainty. Is paramount. And not knowing where you need to go or knowing that you need to go to several different regulatory agencies to get approval to. To administer your product or to receive any type of license in order to operate your business in the state. Can be extremely cumbersome and cost prohibitive and potentially prohibited. Prohibitive in any sense of form whether or not they're even going to decide to. Offer that product in the state of it in that particular state. I am very much considering. Working with this committee the committee on banking finance insure l√† moan about creating a specific regulatory agency that would. Monitor and provide all. The regulatory. Oversight specific to this industry and so of course as a as we move through that I'd- appreciate the input. Of all of you. I got a lot of. I have a lot of questions and to see if I can. Keep that. Keep it as short as I possibly can. It. We have different flat. Tell tell me a little bit about what it lease for coin bass and ripple what is the platform that you're using to administer your product I mean I've and now there's the theory and there's a couple of different platforms of delivery my question is you know we've we've seen certain instances where you know we talk about blockchain as being something that is immutable but yet. You know there's this concern because you have mount finex pinpoint different instances where we've seen people that have been taken advantage of either from the standpoint of raising money and saying that they're offering a product with that they're not actually going to offer their just stealing money to where they're actually are have been multiple Tokyo based companies that have been the platforms that have been completely corrupted. So what are the what other delivery services that you guys yes. Are using. It does start. Ups are at X. the it'll only thank you between project developers like ripple and exchanges like Clinton's so. As to will the more fully I'm sure ripple has a black it is a check. When bass does not quite bass connects to double different blockchain because what street. We ourselves don't administer one so the issue with things like mount docks had nothing to do with the immutability of a blockchain it had to do with the idea that mount **** one of the earliest exchanges. Didn't have what we would consider to be a real fast or or industry standard security system. One of the things we often say a coin bass and I almost hesitate. Loud with cameras rolling. Largest custodian the world because we have a patented custody. Technology that much less likely that someone would be able to do to us what about docs again I'm knocking on whatever surfaced this this is. Having having said that the underlying block chains that we connect to do have different security features and one of the things we look at when determining what the list an asset on our platform. Is a security review of that block chain and we deem the underlying token to be T. in secure that we typically don't listed in fact just last week we were looking at an asset which is a major global asset that we decline to put on the platform for that very reason. I do want to just very quickly in twenty seconds or less say one thing about your opening comment about the. About the need for a new regulator or some sort of regulatory clarity. Revised by a single regulator to go to market to do Sir. Subject to regulation. I would just caution you that the issue with creating a new regulator. At least one tried another jurisdiction. Eight of the are looking and so I think of for example see if. Was there financial protection regulator. Until the FTC decided to get back in that business and compete with them sort of like once. I am there was a single competition regular the federal law. But now the justice department any see compete with each other for jurors. Were different mergers and of the end of the day. I think the better approach is to have a Ste charter so. How do you know. Prison that's the only structure. But I don't. Financial. Shop trying to answer questions. A lawyer not a cryptographer so I. Get as close as it pushed to write it I can't Chau rebel is a company that. Two did you since they can either in a way that's faster cheaper more transparently in the legacy system which is known as the swift system on one of the products that. We offer can lead to the last said called X. or P. extra piece it's on a let. The permission list Landry. The coin ledger but I think that's with the latter days top a repetition controller. Terpene orders it own control the lecture. Court is the big one labor is based on a proof of work so when they're- and the- there's a map. There's a race that take off and land a corporation first individual who solve the math question gets rewarded in a pickle. About moving to some all proof of cake meetings the more you own the car you have to. Transactions on the ledger war he. Which which for extra letters the verifiable corrective training caption. The X. does he prefer steak hi it doesn't. There's a consensus mechanism when you have 80% of the participants on the ledger agreed that the transaction that they're seeing is the correct and verifiable transaction match the transaction because that goes through so if Allen this and a thousand dollar do you want to try to center twice. Centers mechanism after which is to try. We need to decide which of those two transactions was the verifiable transaction. The reason the excerpted ledgers consensus mechanism seems to work and has never failed and unlock just is Brian is knocked. Is because all of the petitions participants have in and current common interest in the integrity of the attack consensus protocol in other words we're not competing for a bit coin rewards risk trying to race to soften mathematical. Problem we're not competing to earn earn or own more easily can have a greater vote. We all Hannah old notes on the system have an equal vote and when 80% of those no degree it's the that transaction that's verified. So we hear a lot about the 51% of agreement your E. you require 80% so the X. RP led her into that we don't order control requires 80% consensus so we believe it is immutable from a 51% hack which bickering in the Assyrian lectures have seen in the past. Thank you. And I think this. For the interest of time the focus when it comes to at least fourteen nine want to be doing with this bill and I think the state of California going to be doing is and we certainly take with the uniform l√† commission to put together very seriously and are gonna go through every aspect of that to determine. You know what works for us and what doesn't work for us but whatever we end up doing is can be very much California is going to be dependent on you know. The role we want to we want to serve a when it comes to this new burgeoning industry. Even though it's not so small so version because it it is well established and you know come up with a very California specific plan when it comes to these digital currencies and how we decide to regulate them and how we- implement these technologies and so. I think it'll be important for all of all of you to continue to stay engaged in this process especially as we work on this bill be working very closely with the committee of that banking and finance on this and so you know as a process plays out it's gonna really important to have that important to have. Your expertise to help us craft something that is going to be not just. Not only California's Pacific the revolutionary and how regulation as good at and how a state or any the federal government any. Government has gone about regulation. Of any type of digital currencies because- California we are the leader and innovator when it comes to technology. Not just in this country but around the world. And I want California to be. A hub and I want us to continue to be that. To be that leader and I trust what we do as a state. Because we are going to be more thorough. And more. And respectful of the idea of creativity and innovation but also at the same time focus on consumer protection to make sure whatever products being offered to our to our citizens and to our consumers in the state of California the people that we represent they're gonna be protected and have that that confidence to be able to use these products without fear of not a without fear of. Feeling like they're gonna be taking advantage of at some point in time sell your businesses are great. And your advocacy is amazing. I really appreciated the partnership we appreciated your time today but I think at this point I'm organ we want to our second panel thank you thank you very. Thank you it was great to hear kind of the business and industry for spectrum. At the next panel it is going to focus on the consumer perspective and I want to invite to rainy right man. Chief programme officer for Electronic Frontier Foundation and Susan Martin deals in your policy council for. And western US states legislative manager for Consumer Reports for joining us. And if we want to start with rainy. The second off. Thank you thank you chair woman the mon and thank you majority leader Calderon it's an honor to be here and I'm really excited to be testifying here today I represent the Electronic Frontier Foundation we're a nonprofit civil liberties law and technology organization we were founded in nineteen ninety and we champion free speech privacy and innovation we have over thirty thousand dues paying members. The majority of the FX funding comes from these members that's because our mandate is to represent the concerns of technology users both the technology users of today and the technology users of tomorrow. And the chief programme officer the FF and I've been writing and speaking up publicly about the civil liberties implications of blockchain technology regulation sense probably two thousand and eleven. As you start thinking about you know potential regulation in this space I won offer a few thoughts to help bring that conversation. First I'd- like to talk about the fact that the impetus behind blockchain technologies is one that seeks to empower consumers in financial systems that have historically and systematically. Disempowered them and rob them of their privacy. In my role EFF I had been contacted by individuals. And small businesses many times over the years who have had their financial accounts and payment systems restricted or shut down with little recourse. Based on the whims of banking institutions rather than the execution of laws. For example smashed words is one of the world's most popular hubs for self published authors. And they pay all of their authors through through pay pal and pay pal shut down their entire account because some of their romantic fiction which to be clear these are books with no photos there just fiction books was too risque for PayPal's case. With companies like Wells Fargo fraudulently opening millions of accounts and Equifax exposing the sensitive data of over a hundred and forty eight million Americans. American consumers have more reason than ever to be wary of sharing their financial information. Many blockchain innovation seek to use technology to protect privacy in secure conceit data at a keep financial information away from corporations. Cannot trust. Well blocking technologies alone cannot resolve this disempowerment technological advances such as blockchain may well prove part of a long term solution that. Consumers. I think policy may be looking at may blocks. As no logical partner to the regulatory fight to defend consumers against wrongdoing by financial companies. Secondly a pile so I'm hoping to point out how. At the human right to privacy and freedom of expression are often heavily implicated in potential regulations of block allergy. For example EFF has pushed back against those laws that would prevent every day. Our financial transaction using privacy coins which our tokens that protect the privacy of their users. We've also oppose proposed. At including one recently in. U. K. U. band. To prevent consumers from accessing at technology that protects their individual privacy or from publishing free software raises a host of human rights issues in addition to being contrary to free expression and the privacy protections in trying in the constitution. We've talked about it a little but just to overview a blockchain is a distributed ledger it's a database that stores multiple copies of data across many computers in a network. The first application of blockchain technology was bit coin. The queen's promise was to revolutionize value as the internet revolutionized information to make it possible to send values across the globe digitally and securely without needing a bank. And traditionally we know that transferring values between participants are required banks and other third parties that had to each update their own ledgers so that they could record a transaction. And bit coin basically cuts out the middle man and made it possible for. As a single ledger that could be updated and maintained permanently by a wide network of computers it's not maintained by a single entity but rather store to maintain by computers working together. This distributed ledger is called. A blockchain because the ledger permanently and secures securely stores data by linking or chaining blocks of data together through encryption. So the big queen blockchain is a record of big coin transactions but there are many other applications at that the distributed ledger technology as the legislature thinks about regulations it's really important to think and recognize that future innovation in the space. Might have be using these distributed read ledgers for purposes beyond what we typically think of when we think of financial services. To just offer a single example for the sake of time is. Point applies l√† technology to file storage at. Huge Ben including. Tools like slack it has a level for hours and that is because so much of the modern web at uses a single service to back up and do their file storage Amazon web services when an Amazon data center suffered an outage for several hours multiple popular online platforms were unavailable to consumers so file point sixty decentralized file storage said there's no single point of failure like the current system that is so heavily rely on Amazon. And while we can't know if file point or some of these other applications of blockchain ultimately be successful. Ample of a black chamber correct design serve consumer needs are not met a modern tech companies and to create a more decentralized there were more resilient web. Keeping my- interest knowledge users especially underserved thing tech company. From an inmate. We have a few guiding principles that we put together a to help. To help regulators sort of think about how to balance the needs for innovation consumer choice and consumer protection. At to summarize these principles the first we think that regulation should not undermine privacy enhancing innovation in this space the right to privacy is enshrined in the United States constitution in international human rights law and California's own constitution and this state as you are well aware is a leader in can defending consumer privacy and has been a bellwether state for bringing new privacy protections to consumers. And we would hope that California can continue to observe uphold this consumer protections even as it starts to think about the crypto currency space. A second we- would urge that regulation should not show future innovation. At a that will benefit consumers so at as has been pointed out the blockchain ecosystem is still relatively young. There are up well established companies right now though that have the resources to hire expert counsel and compliance officers to navigate state federal and international regulations. We want to ensure that these early entrants do not establish themselves and then pull up the ladder behind them. A in the technology spear when existing services don't serve the needs of consumers new products can come along to try to give consumers better choices. We want to ensure that these new services can continue to try to give consumers choices and serve consumers and does and that regulation doesn't serve to merely entrench the big players of today. And part of that is insuring that there are adequate on ramps for it new services coming to market and also that any regulation is technologically neutral and doesn't prioritize one particular protocol or crypto currency over another. A and principle three a we would urge that regulation should focus on custodial services so custodial services are those entities that hold and trade tokens on behalf of users. And are in our opinion out most likely to abuse consumer trust in fact they as you. At have already pointed out at have a sordid history of fried and sloppy security practices not all of them but some of them have. Been as featured in the news for this. And these are the companies that we think need to be held to account to ensure that they don't de fraud at consumers. So regulators could focus their energies on those bad actors and at there's youth we think of the larger ecosystem there's not just between companies and blocking companies. That hold as a funds for consumers our tokens but there's other types that maybe perhaps don't hold funds that man perhaps we should be a little more hesitant about and then there are merchants there's miners. And there's individual consumers and so when you're thinking about regulation it's important to be focusing on those bad actors first and foremost ensuring that every day consumers and everyday merchants that's just a store down the street that wants to start accepting crypto currency. They're not the ones. That are hitting the regulatory burden. And then my final two principles I'm almost done as as a fourth that any regulation should recognize the important role of decentralized exchanges and other decentralizing technologies and empowering consumers. The centralisation of control creates a brittle digital systems where a single point of failure can shut down commerce or communication. Much of the strength of the modern web comes from its decentralization and many of the problems we see in technology space are result of a handful of big technology companies. Having undue control over much of our digital experience watching technologies were built to be resilient and decentralized and future innovation that advances decentralization. Including decentralized exchanges should be protected. And finally our fifth principle is that regulation should not punish those who merely write and publish code. At my organization has fought to establish and a number of courts have recognized that writing computer code is a form of expressing ideas similar to other forms of communication like writing books. And music as that's protected by the first amendment. We would hope that policy mage at policymakers would ensure that regulations aimed at blockchain technologies do not prohibit the publication or distribution of code. Or otherwise require parties to a government. License before published. Judy mayor Kurt. Bottom is very much appreciated. This is an- good morning thank you a Majority Leader color and children Limon for inviting me to testify here today a lot of incredible new one can meet formation already been. Provide here I want to just kind of take a little bit of a step back and say okay where we act on this conversation. It's an it's an necessary conversation for us to have. And it's a very important one for us to have given that these technologies in these new products and services you know represent what could be you know a dominant you know if you know if could be the vanguard the future of money. But it is also very apparent that there are so many different ways in which virtual currencies and block chain can show up in our lives. That it's not always apparent but you can have a lot of smart people in the room is not always apparent to stews point that people are using the same terminology you're talking about the same things and have the same. Priorities in mind for how to approach this I'm going to add a couple on additional elements here that are you know in in many ways evergreen when her consumer advocate which is you know you have. A complex market place here there are existing laws and regulations the overlap in some areas may confirm. Whether it's how we define whatever meal a virtual currency or digital asset is verses you know how they should be regulated you know who should bear the risk. For Los reliability. At the end of the day. It tends to be pretty simple for consumers as end users just a regular person with a phone. Who just wants to know if I load money into an app. And meant to do stuff with it I'm just gonna you know by something ominous on my friend money. Is a gonna work the way it's supposed to. And if something goes wrong can I fix the problem. Who do I go to fix that problem. And if I lost money in a shouldn't have can I get my money back. And these kinds of evergreen really basic issues are important for all of us but especially important for folks who are using their phone as their computer as their bank and maybe living paycheck to paycheck and can't afford for a forty dollar Venlo transaction that goes wrong. To stay a reversible you know our organization is a national research testing an advocacy organization has worked on consumer finance issues for decades. We've seen you know the passage of right you know laws and regulations of regulate our credit cards our bank accounts or debit cards more recently prepaid debit cards now finally have federal protections. Against fraud and theft and so every time there's a new generation on the standard seem we're always looking at at the end of the day have we- addressed release surfaced. These existing you know evergreen issues that are going to hit consumers because in such a complex ecosystem is this with you've got. Got coders you have not developers you know you've got let's see institutions who may be using ripple to move money faster. You know you have business and you just government and use. No construed and users don't have a lot of direct market place power here and the power information symmetry is vast. So and even today in today's world in the long for decades had. Consumer protections nationally for various kinds of legacy ways to pay for goods and services and people don't always know the difference I don't know there's a different law applies to your credit card trend. Xin then. The one that applies to your debit card transaction their little. Different and in any case people tend to expect these days the whatever financial service they're using. There are clear rules of the road it is a problem they can fix it they can reverse about transaction get their money back. And I can't sitting here today. Tell you know how many of the offerings of the providers of virtual currencies our platforms are going to be guaranteeing those same kinds of protections some may voluntarily do so some may not. And so that's the challenge that we all face here but I think the main take away. I'm other than your service in the fact that there are. Novel questions of one policy but they're also unsolved existing questions of one policy that always come up. I'm for consumers when technology at your moves faster and then the laws and regulations is to say that's- stakeholder engagement like this. Is absolutely essential I think that we all want to make sure we're having the same conversation. It's the right conversation and of the right people are at the table. Are because there's a lot to take in here and understands that we can be. Speaking the same language and speaking of fluently as we think about regulatory approaches here there are some areas where. California as a state government you know could look at some of its licensing of supervision. And enforcement you know at a sororities are but some of this is also quite frankly gonna go beyond California. I think that as we're looking at regulatory approaches we need. In about what can we do through the state regulation. To coordinate with other government agencies this guy at the need to because in coordination with the federal government as well as they are looking to. Solve some of these problems in the federal reserve for those who don't know is finally moving forward. With building out a new real time payment. I'm just our existing king system which is on. Long as into slow at moving money as well. To clear for example I and now they're even bipartisan calls because of Facebook and we were there bipartisan calls I'm coming from Congress to the feds in maybe the food and help our virtual. And see so there's a lot of activity. Partisan. At the national level as hearing yeah so what particular advocating. Order which is thank that remember we just. The novel policy questions verses the pre existing policy questions we need answered when it comes to protecting consumers who purchase funds are being used in with these products I and then also make sure the convening stakeholders and I think it's of essential consumer. Advocate we have. A room. Asians and they are always in the room a reserve. In other work groups some very very heartened that we were invited today and the consumer protection perspective was given room to. Presented I think that's going to wear this can affect all one way or another as the ten part. Campaign estimates that arm in the direction. Products and services take so thank you again some for the opportunity to testify today. Great thank you. The rainy. We thought of it about the relationship block and gonna come in January one twenty twenty with the CPA. Actions. That is great. As is so we have I guess the longer each year to that is. I have a band state legislative team and if you would like us to. I do assisting kind. That I'm happy to. I haven't been working on the C. C. P. a and so I hate to step a in general he to sit to imagine things I don't know that much about but I would be particularly low to step on their toes. I do know that there are a lot of questions at out at about in box chains this is where you. Can't be here question out. Of the box. For example under GPR you might want to see removed and that's just an outstanding. The question that I don't think is the been resolved yet at least nine I'm- not. A for the most part I have. Where you see block chains to store. His entrance rather than a what we- this content. At messages and so I feel like to be at that is not entirely true there's different. Ways that you can use. Today that would communicate messages I think. A some a so that that's the only question I really dived into a little bit more than that. Do you have thoughts on that question. What in just for those or not sure what's easy PACC P. is a Calvary consumer privacy act that the legislature passed to give consumers about more control over there over their information more than they've ever had in the past the requested take information down or not have information shared or Ste the war sold. In ways that they don't want that information shared or sold and sell that's something that we are we're gonna be having come in fact in January one twenty twenty and I'll only reason why I ask is when you take a look of watching technologies they're two different schools of thought it's the most transparent. I which is a good thing but that all some say it's the most secure because you have privately in a public key ad in the public he identifies you but then the private key something that you keep to yourself and the supposed to be private to you. And so when there's when you're when you're working on blockchain you're dealing a blockchain make transaction this. Is information that anybody can see. Now anybody can see is important because of the transparency make sure. You can. Verify the validity of the transaction but also at the same time do I want. To be able to see. That I made a specific transaction Mullin I mean Sir. Criminal I don't want people to seize stern track. But if I. Certain medications or the things. If my employer can see that in and or or prospective employer can see that could they use that against me when I was the hiring process of something else. So I'm just curious to see the real at. Least in California that's gonna develop between change and the CCP a. To consumers more control of their own personal information at the same time how. That have that control the regulation. Well one thing I think that's a really good point and one of the things that is really interesting in the blockchain spaces were seen the rise of privacy points which I mentioned so those are things like Minero and see cash in these are tools that so the traditional blockchain as- ecosystem as you mentioned it's pseudonymous so it's not associated with your name but it is associated with basically an account number so that. If it ever got connected back to you all of your prior transactions that were associated with that pseudonymous account would be kind of visible in public I've had it compared to the way. You know. The stock market is not it's public but you don't you know that's all under kind of. Little acronyms so. With privacy coins you've got coins that protects the- transactional information so the account it's being sent to and from and the amount that's beans. And is still able to verify things so to me this is a really interesting and exciting area of animation. It's not widespread right now in its use and I would you know echo what you said there's a lot of reasons that everyday people who were doing nothing wrong care a lot about their financial privacy. I personally care a lot about my financial privacy if I have to pick up medication or something I do choose to do it in cash I don't sign up for like. The CVS of rewards program that requires my phone number. And I. I deeply sympathize with our need to go after bad actors who might be using funds in ways to basically. Find their bad activities. But my purpose here is to stand up for everyday people who aren't doing anything wrong who still want their privacy and making sure that in our- attempt sick. You to go after these bad actors we don't accidentally prevent everyday consumers from using. Privacy points and things of that nature I think it's gonna be interesting to see this conversation between the centralization centralization. I continue to of all because I think. The idea originally behind blockchain the decentralization was a little more. A libertarian anarchists and in its in its inception of you know I don't want the government. Knowing or having any control or any institution have any control over anything that I do I want to be completely a Thomas I think that there's a lot of people. That would share that sentiment maybe not the anarchy said about sentiment but- aren't missions as is the libertarian side of that sentiment but the- but the idea that I have more control over my own information and my own. Finance finances rather than having to always deal with some type of intermediary an intermediary every time I make a transaction with they they they charge me. A fee to make that transaction and so I think there's a lot that's going to be discovered but I just don't. I don't see at I find it. I think it's going to be difficult to move to a more decentralized. System without finding a way to implement this technology and blockchain and centralized manners to centralize ways with the with the center with a centralized administrator. At because a big part of the problem is that you have a lot of folks that. Have no idea what blockchain is when I'd when I when I authored the legislation. About creating the blotching working group. Yeah I don't know what this is all rescue but you know what you your- in the- heard watching I don't know what that even means I and you know when you're dealing with let us listen our stay there in with two thousand issues in a given year yeah there might not be that time. To complete. Really understand what that is and so you were a lot of different legislators have expertise is. Two other legislation in your own research based on. Never is trying. Present to you in terms policy but- you know I think that. We want. A lot of the stuff out. To have this to her side the equation always. Bob press there because it seems to get caught up in the excitement of a lot of it. But there's a catch to our decisions that we're gonna making a lot of people. Apple and if it eventually be harmed whatever we choose to rate. Played. Thank you for being here if I could just response. I mean at I think the- date to San made this really good point. A lot of the a lot of the people interacting with the chain ecosystem today. Are interacting with it the way similar to how they were. King with. King institution passed. You're dealing with a studio services. On behalf. People. I believe the first panel argued thoroughly regulated already but I would argue are the most likely to and really on a- practices. Because they have. Out of whack you are right that right now the initial idea of blockchain is not like people are not one to wine interacting and totally cutting out centralizing entities. The way perhaps the originators of watching had hoped. Days we actually have no idea what is look like twenty sure now and there's a lot of really being new patients going to make it much much easier. For people to do person the person. And so I went whatever. Today doesn't prevent those kind of interesting new more consumer and brain tools from of being Burke tomorrow. I think you may questions thank you and I will close just one question. I know we still haven't at an all you can. Asians I mean are California regulators can only start. A so many new programs and focus on so many new things and clearly there's a lot. The space space is this fall a list. Musicians in terms of things that the state should be thinking about. Yeah I think it's fair to say for Consumer Reports that are for focus on sort of emerging emerging pays me to say merging payments I mean really like emerging financial technologies as big as a core part of our financial policy teams work. There are a lot of non profits out there that focus on a lot of aspects of consumer finance I think a lot of people are rightly very much focused on consumer lending and cleaning up some of the things that took a long time for us to address to begin with. Kind of isn't it true traditional banking and lending spaces but there is I think there are more advocates are starting to look into this but I think it's fair to say that in many respects a lot of fun. Also a lot of sources of funding for nonprofits to do advocacy work tend to focus on maybe things that seem more tangible around income support or criminal just comparable justice Gration like life or death the supposedly seems life or death. And I think what we try to do as an organization of prioritize is financial policy from a consumer protection perspectives to point out that people. Here in California and around the country are. So many of them are struggling financially and it is impacting their lives in ways that could just be on what's in their wallet and that this this. These kinds of. Is kinds of issues can really make an impact your physical health and so we is always want to make sure that. Where they were looking at something that's emerging or trying to. It you know and improve a long standing existing policy issue that that these financial issues are seen as an economic justice issues. That that. On the impact everybody because we all use money but and then of course we must remember. That whenever there is a problem or a gap in protections it will always disproportionately impact. Those who can least afford to lose their precious funds to araneus transaction. Thank you this is also very interesting question. I really enjoyed all these questions I would say you know it's an interesting time because. You know it even three years ago I thought this was absolutely the wrong time to try to do any regulation in this space other than you know what was already kind of in place because that. The ecosystem is moving so quickly and- I certainly don't necessarily feel strongly about that now I can see there's things have evolved to the point that you've got companies of this size of queen based like there are established companies that. It makes sense to regulate that so I completely sympathize and if this is the time that California government decides it wants the get involved in the space you know I can understand that. That said a if you decided not work on a bill this year and put it off for a year I think that would also be okay. And as far as how it pulls in our priorities a. I think there's this big fear that. Lack of regulatory certainty creates makes it really different difficult for blocking companies to figure out where they can be and what they can do and it pushes them out of the area. But. A very poorly written law that affects a consumer's in ways that we didn't realize or intend. Is it is much worse than that right in my opinion and so taking the time to do it rates which I believe this process has been incredibly inclusive and I a applauded. Is more important than trying to just get something out there. Yes I've works globally we have a lot of different issues and we also work on the federal level and in California on a wide range of issues so we are definitely engaged. But I would say you know we're really working on. Surveillance encryption issues are sort of one of our top. And double speech issue. Thank you. Time your participation. Thank you can move on to our third panel now which is the rate Tory perspective. Any album press. Is out with the K. F. the department of this oversight and Keith Rowley. Eight unit. In the craft. Right to squeeze his mere uniform regulation of virtual currency business act Majority Leader Calderon and members of the committees as well as the rear Honda community college. Community hi manual Alvarez commissioner of the California department of business oversight. The role to which I was appointed in may of this year. Thank you so much for the opportunity to participate in this hearing about virtual currency emerging and rapidly changing industry my own background is almost equal parts consumer protection and fintech so I very much appreciate the opportunity to engage in these sorts of conversations about. The intersection of a technology and financial policy. We talk a little bit about the department of business oversight first and then I will share some thoughts that I have with you all about virtual currency. The department of business oversight licenses and regulates over three hundred and sixty thousand. Individuals and entities a provide financial services through a California. The department licenses and regulates money transmitters issuers of payment instruments answered Valley. Arts as of June this year the department had written to me transit unless the- well total of over forty. Eight banking securities and commodities are. Regulated by. That may overlap with a conversation that we're having here virtual current. The he's a bass that I provide in expertise latest virtual currency specifically on the following topics for one concert. However the fraud you have a current laws and regulations apply to virtual currency businesses number three requests from virtual currency business is. For three thirty number for that part views on the uniform l√† commission regulatory framework and number five policy trade offs or implementation knowledge as a- teacher might consider. What. Provide I will offer the permits perspective on those issues. One to make plans for virtual currency fraud. When the department received complaints regarding virtual currency. Viewed by our. In division to. Currently there are approximately fifteen education spending and the departments and four division and year to date twenty nineteen the department is received. Teen of which are against the same range for researchers. Past three years the number the department has reached about ritual currency has fluctuated. Generally speaking complaints come in waves based on the forgery some well known see such as corn and the related customer demand. Teen the department received. Sixty complaints. To virtual currency so which. I'm a processing of transactions. That surgeon complaints appear again appear to be related to the sharp run up and demand for virtual currency around this time last year. Again which seem to impact customer service response. But with respect to the particular comply the department did not have jurisdiction take action in many cases because- service or good and later to a nation of security. Other laws. Overseas in twenty fifteen the department it desist inner frame order against a company called US investment arts Inc and three of the firms it is urging that they sold securities without a Christian and misled investors. In selling the securities. That order requires US hi I a officers stopper the violation. Me is based in Arcadia and did a multi level marketing so the prop master. Money Gen coin. TVO entered into settlement with the opening in December twenty eighteen or by the agreed to stipulate to a- it was estimated that my. The department may have jurisdiction over a virtual operation if what our securities laws it is being violated for instance hello asset. Thirty if is if. Digital assets will gain v√† on the part profit in the future. Another example. Of a sham crypto currency. If said and tell the customer the combined and on the side in fact they don't sell bitcoin on the way. That the cell. Actually when complaints are received related to conserve customer service issues or delays in processing transactions where there is no one to defraud. We may refer. It's the California attorney general's office consumer law action for you of deceptive practices. Commodities laws but we have no evidence that the company is acting in California. Then that may be referred over to the securities exchange commission or the U. S. Camanche. Treating commission. Number two and St Los. Yeah the department has not turned. In a the part the buying and selling. Under the money transmission act. Or other related laws under the department's purview the money transmission in. Regulates the receiving of money for.

Eighteen perceived twenty request from virtual currency businesses. Tory clarity. Question thirty five of those are still pending. If the department identified as an out of the business the also. Under. We would provide written guidance to the requester about the need for less. This plan does not include. Xin we generally issue a lot. Lester and for that the business model does not appear to require licensure at this time that the department use the study of. American.

And could provide certainty regarding what entities and activities are covered or not covered. The drive to promote innovation as a registration option for lower ball of fur v√† falling virtual currency activity. Is the type of is approach that I could be part of a start up companies. The department does broken. Questions framework. Any rate three structure. Must be tailored California's summer protection needs. One example the minimum net worth requirement of twenty five thousand dollars the commission commission framework. Across the board as a quick compared. Money transmitters must maintain tangible shareholder's equity of at least fifty thousand dollars depending on the size. Second this regulatory framework hasn't been it did by any state and therefore is untested which really makes it difficult to anticipate how regulation. Effect the virtual industry or consumers. Lastly the verge the end. Allow. As you sit here today may be outdated or soon become outdated. That said we do believe that the unit from law commission models are starting for it for conversation the regulatory framework. To focus on the opportunities that we have to harmonize some of our existing laws and regulations so is to leverage the good work that the department is already doing. Finally topic area number five policy trade off some input implementation challenges. A predictable and scalable regulatory framework for virtual currency would pose benefits to all stakeholders in California from consumers and investors. To the company's on down to the department as a regulator. Mr knowing their- and are regulated businesses would benefit by focusing. Collective efforts pourtant work complying with the predictable set of Tatian. Other than crafting. Through all. SB some challenge as it stands today the department has already observed several risks associated virtual currency. Some complaints again we have received. Five areas implementation budget. There are other five Lee permission pernicious reduce the need to be Medicare and such risks could include bad actors funding with customer deposits. Lack of appropriate cybersecurity systems prevent of customer funds black. Continuity planning to also persons who hold blocks and that company assets. You were tension undisclosed fees taken their investors. Encouraging news I think the encouraging news and such for. Our at all arts although all and the department has for some time been addressing Ste. St products the case of this. I think the balance. So restrictive or priest give stressed and it apparently stifled emerging technology in industry out of California. But not so hands off Aston bridges straighten actors that would take an inch of for the consumer. Esther's it's also important to the ways in which kallus. Exist today might be hope so. There are merging treason knowledges as such. I would prop. Creating a sensible for. Around a new age around three. The focus should be on defining the industry itself first principles basis. What are those distinct products and services that comprise it. Water the attendant risks of each type product or service. How could each attendant risk or be addressed to three existing regulations. For example the features of an initial coin offering roughly speaking a method of cap mission through. The asset the tech features risks that type product in not be the same as those of a stable and which is itself pay cable currency or other assets. After the industry products the comprises cogent defined we might the crew. Testing existing laws and. Help identify legal right for gas but are tailored to the risks that again type of crypto currencies post to cal tumors and stirs. Close again would like to thank the good for the opportunity to discuss the opportunities challenges that the department seize cryptocurrency industry. Some the end of tape the end. Course has been born in California many. Investors and other stakeholders are located. From the parts department do we certainly applaud. Your leadership and we stand by at the ready to our top assistant on any policy duration related virtual. Currency and certainly have questions here today. Commissioner Alvarez. Number here for rally for me commissioner commission. Their job is to the pressure logging Russian about a school of law I was in. Both the drafting of the year curricula sure Kersee businesses up and the supplemental act are we what we will not cover back. That which are two distinct axle. Press I'll talk a little bit more about both. In a minute I've I've been asked to speak just a little you will see. Us for the river for lunch that's what you all want I. Three lost about the Aussie in the process this all try. And make it quick. I also got to the to say it's fairly obvious from. The present. At signally more of the speakers not including me are are fairly professional testify. I tend to have notes and the from the glass when I go testifying I never take more than two minutes to prepare that's because of about twenty minutes talk. I'm expecting questions. That kind of like Apollo. In in. Everyone at arms from walking mission is a nonprofit organization made up of volunteers who were appointed by the- state each. Fifty states the district. For the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Priest. A mixture well that's not true every states the delegations are made up of mixtures of practicing lawyers sitting judges retired judges law professor. Legislation for exactly that the exact makeup of any particular states. Adult is entirely and how it. Gates and composes it's you know law commission delegation son. The. We significant state Sir are surprisingly small others I heard a- little bit of a swipe at it Montana I won't have a. The largest delegation of any state the uniform l√† commission which gives them an outside present in dress committees and subcommittees but when it comes to. Taking the product of drafting committee is to the floor of the of the uniform l√† commission. For reading and- Asian each they get. California where California has a people delegation eighteen twenty eight for that matter AB usually how many of them show up comes down to. Members. The commission. Been in business for twenty years. Of the very significant uniform acts that have been very widely adopted by the Ste it's the bell Weber are the bell cow we will. Is what I. Time to. Code AB which has been adopted in all fifty states as well as district of Columbia have with the exception that Louisiana it's refused to adopt the sales and leases provisions because they like their Napoleonic code better. But there are other acts that you'll see is produced that have not really met with much success probably the most notorious at least in my again fields is called uniforms information transactions act. Which was an attempt to come up with the uniformed law dealing with software transactions among other things I started off as being part of the used as part of a new a new article for the UCC bombed out. The American law institute bailed out of the project and left it in the U. Aussies lab. And once the you'll see was finished with that exactly two states now in. Eighteen years of adopted. And what I like to tell my students when we talk about it is that. What's unique about the act is the three states of actually enacted with reporter comma refer to as you see the bomb shelter laws. That will prevent you see to from applying to their residents. Even if the governing law for transaction would point to the law of either Maryland. The eye of the beholder. And as I said spend most my time teaching you from commercial code in one of the things that I tell my students is that. The uniform commercial code. A misnomer it is not uniform. Mostly uniform. And parts of it are the what anybody. Is in the code base some would consider to be a- well it's been codified. Is on what. Bob sizzled about the you will see at the center volunteers we're not we're not stated in any way although for our states will remembers. Acosta ending the annual meeting which is basically our hunger if you were. We're a for a week we- is the completion. Question suggestions en en dag occasionally get arguments about the direction of the drafting committees. Are taking that or whether there should be project. Go forward and only for the for the acts that are ready to be. Put before the body for a vote there the body. The last day and we both the mother nay and then both the- should say. Out to the state's attorney they've been approved ago the state actually first they go to the American bars. Are sincere. As they- but on not. After we finished with them they also have advisors. On all of our study commission drafting committees. And then. This to me is fine with what we've done which could be because there's always at least one AB adviser on the project at all. The axe become available the state's. Or at worst. And raft into actual bill. In the FAQ section not be word for word what comes. Out of the Aussie I am. I from my perspective. Specially state law. That seven in in one my correction it has acted. In Rhode Island the yeah. A and the this seven a law. We're twist to it not sure that. Of a sign post but read up on that in fact the. N. the bill in Nevada earlier this year made it up. Quite far but because the internet a legislature only meeting every other year and having very hard deadlines on when bills reported out of committees. The originating chamber that before they can move on to the other chamber in to a floor vote. I'm were times as many bills it could possibly. Gotten through this. It it. Basically got help. I'm sure there's a little bit movement. But it's a slowly. We hope that. Let's see what all process Wiest D. S. would want commissioner has more work and a member of the executive it has the notion that there's something like. In this new except en worthy. Some benefit nine in having uniform law that were at least more uniform law all of this having less than. The person sure. I'm in cation Congress will that take the horns and solve. Alas at nine a issue the Switzerland and the U. K. and Singapore don't have to deal with this fifty three jurisdictions with the single national jurisdiction. The proposal's may two greatest medi at again Dodd is as much background. Move on. A for this act was created in in it will for the for the RV CVA was created. I in January of twenty fourteen. By telephone mostly. We're serving up of about eighteen months there was a large stakeholders. Person mostly all tended by up by telephone the to place in April of twenty fifteen after the it already made its recommendation to the executive of the you'll get to. Set up a drafting committee I'm just weird thing that rebel. The stakeholders meeting in the drafting process that followed we have the- a ripple of the electronic freedom front cheer from point base. As well as a number of other at entities conference the state banking supervisors point center visual chamber of commerce the California department of business oversight the entertainment software says Gen and lots of others as well as lawyers private practice the percent plants. The occupying the space door wanting to occupy the space. Writing process took about two years AB we started in the fall of twenty eighteen we presented final act to the conference in July twenty seventeen. Yes with the exception of the next act I'm gonna mention really briefly and despite their business despite and eight in extensive discussion on the floor. That spread over five that the seven days of the meeting ultimately the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of approving the act as amended in response to the extensive discussion on the floor. I think it was something on the order of ninety eight hi objection nursery. Getting too many there are a forty eight highest. Extensions into non voting's it's been awhile since Porter Rico send anybody to the meeting. One thing that we that we encountered as we were approaching the end of the drafting process for the U. R. V. should be a was. Was this question of. How this might integrate with existing commercial law. We've been so focused on on the thrust of the your first BCV a witch's. Prudential regulation. If you know the it's perfectly fine if people want to. Send directly from one to the other at that point ether are or- like pointer does point or whatever it is that they they're- you know that they happen to have. Our act has nothing Greg gnostic about that it is not a regulation of virtual currency act. Is a regulation of virtual currency business activity act we only. That are the act only cares when intermediaries. Get involved and really more so when medi intermediaries get involved right so opinion sure you probably need. A that means that something like point based. Is dead to me and an exchange to. Carry out the transaction but if I give my credentials to someone else to then interact with point days and- the result of that transaction the credentials fall into the hands you are are directed to the hands of the of a fourth party. Who then ultimately is acting on behalf of the all of it at the end user there are increasing opportunities for things to go wrong and we're very concerned about. The transferred the exchange and the studio functions the that those intermediaries performing that's really almost entirely what the virtual currency business regulation. Business to an activity actors about. Plus consumer protection. The most so late in the process we began to worry that because contrary to what you might of red and on online fortune piece earlier this year there is no opportunity for fractional reserve banking under the either the yours CD the CPA or the supplemental act. Virtual currency businesses have to maintain not only 1100% but one two one. Research if somebody gives them. Whatever that they have to keep exactly that not a dollar equivalent on the day that the that the virtual currency comes down. Sing what is the level and on the day the virtual goes out. But hold one one one hundred reserve. I think if you know the old days when current based on. I am the head to keep it cold or think of Las Vegas if you've ever seen oceans. In cash in it's a fault. Another money to cover every single chip in play for the casino. Millions and millions of dollars every night in cash. Way. We would make chips that would bills. That creates a real problem. This is the to get access to credit. And the need to earn money to expand have. Because the lenders that they might go to it he sees that the I guess to are sufficiently familiar with. This is and how it works. The general consumer you user right that the consumer but other user protection provisions of section five a to the act. The supplemental act was created to replace those general provisions perfectly fine. And if you choose to just an act the RBC via the I will be. Fine and I think most of will be fine but- the more sought the supplement. I am not please. The broadly brushed can use your actions and section of two of the of the fact that with the extra protections that are available under article eighty sixty. I've created this river known environment. I've known. Predator fire it will create opportunities for virtual currency businesses to attract capital and expand making their services more you. All hot this is I know I've probably gone over my time I having got close to where I was going but- how we for questions thank you and I just said that it wanted to ask thank you for that overview that both of you have kind of given the history but also just the role of the D. B. O. as well if you could respond to any of the things that you heard that from the previous panels that caught your attention if you could. Just be very specific on what caught your attention in in your reaction to that. Jump start. I have I have lots of stars. So one thing that that element in a said that that a caught. Me. Off guard was was she made reference to. Missing via the supplemental actors no license in the supplemental actively. You're to replace the user protection provisions in section five oh two and create a. A more stable credit up opportunity. For assistance occupying the space. Something she said in people's. The did resonate thank you mean the- we counted fifty three state life. For every state has its own licensing requirements and that's why we included as a possible. Your view TV. And there's also something wrong actually early something that could be seen as being wrong with requiring somebody already has a money transmitter license in the state of California or a bank license back in the state of California if it's State Bank were federal bank which their federal banker completely exempt from the act but something wrong with requiring them to get yet another license and so we also have reciprocity across. Types of licensure that is overseen by the same agency or by an agency with which the agency that's assigned the responsibility of virtual currency at business activity regulation is communicating with so it really you know creates a possibility not act I have to be honest the conference state banking supervisors initially with working give very closely with us on this project. Provide a lot of input to which you responded and to be very happy with where we're going and then at the you know not even the eleventh hour because it was a long after the act been promulgated but now with the fifteenth or sixteenth our we're we're out trying to get states to enact it they're balking at reciprocity. That because they want to be able to decide who has licenses to do this kind. Of business in their state. Me. They still even if someone is reciprocally licensed across state lines or reciprocal licensed within a state because they have another. License that that covers similar activities they're still subject to all the user protection requirements. They just don't have to get another license. And it's really aren't that we wish were scratching our heads collectively. About about why didn't see as PS deserve change tax on this. The promises of a great new you know better solution to everything. In September in what they came out with was state should have been a money transmitter laws. Which is as one of the. Short documents that passed along from from the you'll see there's some compelling reasons why virtual currency businesses are better regulated as virtual currency businesses rather than as money transmitters because they don't do the same things they do more things in some instances and they do some things differently. At. I wonder if the commission shall Reyes or you can comment. First of all I did a one a think professor rally for two things one for the for the correction and to for invoking oceans. Ocean's eleven at that. That that's fantastic. You know what it would. I wanted to echo a couple of two comments I heard and some the prior panel discussions the first season martingales call for. Broad stakeholder involvement throughout this conversation hi I completely agree that that kind of broad based conversation is really critical for those of us in California. To land to achieve the correct result here mean to be Frank. There's nothing that. I that I think I heard in any the prior conversations there was so. Broad themes that I heard. The desire for a robust concert protection within the space whole whole the department wholeheartedly agrees with that and the desire to. To Claire I through harmonization. But have you completely agree with I don't. However. And you know the other call that I heard in the first half as- Brooks mentioned here is. I were he I do worry. Form shopping if. California gets it wrong or potentially goes down it correct path yes New York articulated a. What you might our perspective. Mark from California's perspective I think that's an opportunity to look to learn from to learn from what they did well and what they did what they could have improved on but the- Facebook libra. Think it's an example of. One consequence. Getting it wrong and space which is. Actually abdicate our legal and regulatory authority to other jurisdictions either domestically or or broad. I worry about the outcomes a- from that. I think in the interest times get thank both of you for participating in this panel I really appreciate the input and this gets into newcomer Salinas we continue to work on my bill AB. Fourteen a not for too. Often stakeholder meetings is that process so much. I am without a do you also want to thank every single one our panelists I think we've very robust com question and it is clear that. Are different can. The move forward I wanted at our- until also think are. Because it is his bill of cap prompted this call our station up eight officially close I do you want to see if there is any public comment. We if there's public we ask that you come to the microphone and that you. Comment public comment so feel free great thanks for having this my name's mark Levin. Executive director. Wearing advocacy group I bet on. We launched exchange as the company to others the pivoted are still around so I understand the regulatory environment be doing it we even played for your bill lays on this bill right now is. Theoretically your exchanges to me that's not really clear in it and right now the D. B. O. is not giving money to mission licenses for exchanges so if this bill was and- I think. It's C. in New York state N. Xing ten which is blocking user in those. I would really kill innovate. How come in the U. S. in general we've already seen a lot of companies moving out of the U. S. and blocking American customers Susan this is. About more exchanges we talked a little bit of the other kind of. Industries like it's I see. Is so I think like to. Off of the exchanges and that just deal with the. The federal rules would be great but I don't think the a you'll see it'll is really great. So companies. If they operate without a late it's up to fifty thousand dollars a day fine also it says in there that they have to pay to be regulated. Which is ext league cost prohibitive to vote he's not the queen base but- but- I would have to hand over a used. Transaction from which can be sure there's an foreign governments so I've I'm really excited that you guys are willing to listen and learn more about the industry and the idea is an education problem I also the- nine so it's like really break. But thank you for a happiness great. In additional public comment we ask that you just line. Behind the microphone please thank you for all poll. Good morning. Times close I visit. Pasadena resident anybody but myself one of an. Focus has been on Buck solution specifically in the financial space but also in regulatory space might entities. So this morning I tried to open up a website. That whole at a is required the publisher to have a license to publish things. I pulled my email and I tried to send it to a friend I'm California gotten L. fourteen eighty on that said well. This petition. In California. For license for because of the. Open up Skype tied to place a phone call to a friend of mine across the street I got a message that I'm sorry the call cannot be completed as dialed L. fourteen eighty nine. Of this car is not a place for California in the kitchen license. Office Lee not. Was still sleeping on that would be observed. This will be as absurd as requiring a softer provide up to ride by a license to deploy software to send instruments at me on I may not be financial page. Does a lot of lack. Knowledge in guns in the space noticed me depend on us this morning and you to budget your hands on how to explain the difference between currencies among the separately. In nineteen seventy one. It being a unit of account and the default of exchange has and he bites. 90% all values being transferred sending bites. Bloom down rate and then put a bit con a dollar sign. All Pokemon in front of it it doesn't matter. So the larger point here. The only thing that should be. They like it. Currency thing up not should not be regulated all those create a are putting eighty nine for anybody wanting to you. I'm happy to it's one. I'm Benjamin Weiss on behalf of coin a big coin ATM company in twenty five states including twenty patients in California yeah we have locations and has no. Calexico and the LA and San Francisco area we provide crypto access and services to the unbanked who put cash in our ATMs to purchase a corner of the crypto currencies and for many people without bank accounts is the only way they can. Get into the point blockchain space at all ATMs are naman shops which we paid to. Our with. Turned about in a eighty nine is not the elation overall because we think. Necessary to give our confidence the consumers. It provide. You to the business so in support of regulate. What worried about is clarity of weather. Eastwood or a light under the spell we have a legal we're able legally to operate in state set new. And if this is a list. In past have operating in California well. As Mister Brooks pointed out anyone a coin space for a while which since twenty fifteen knows the strong of. Patients from fence. Our compliance departments are big department and six. Well support the G. O. ideas behind the bill what we're asking for is a distinction between custodians those whose whole customer funds on behalf of a consumer and those who are just doing wallet v√† wallet transactions we make sure that this bank that this bill does. The on bank people who don't have bank. Taking no company point is the only place we can by crypto. So you know worse than burning small business to make sure there's no. The fact. And we'd like to ask for a wallet v√† wallet exemption this bill to separate those who hold people's funds from those. Sent to. And I like to as for a holding this panel and I appreciate your has been opened. Thank you. My name is grant to lessen I'm a faculty here a three on though and I guess on behalf of myself and some of my students I have couple of comments. And more like questions. To Mr I'll drop. The appeal towards immigrants sending route remittances to serve. A very good one considering. That I mean there's like six. Dollars. And a lot of it's going to the student body that we have here on campus. It depended on two things right people need to have access to technology and does well see vetting this is the remittances. So I need to have act. It is a- controlling interest in being able to regulated because that's going to end up the very very profitable and instead monogrammed. 20% on every time you pointed out wait to take some of the. Two words correct money. Why recipient is a great thing but there is a. Blank problem to it our only goal of federal trying actions needs to be regular. Don cherry transactions between the state and foreign state that means regulated anything only not complete data by. And you can follow through. Is it the gold. Very easy to try the undocumented individuals are doing the said since then it would be very. Identify them five I'm an that could create yet then additional. Probably needs to be looked upon and frankly I think everybody is aware of it if we have a singular regulatory body copying it it's pretty much like I don't know trip every department gov regulating the dollar and we have like a whole bunch of problems. We need that evidence. The national business controlled by were America. Wait. Having a single body controlling it sort of defeat the whole principle and the purpose be and having the currency that is not. One safety not which I think it's safe there. Thanks make sure. Take place and I think a blockchain there was a not public sometimes gonna have desi to wrap it up. We know exactly where legal transaction. In like fifty. There's still no if stop. The house this nation going to address any of it thank. Please state your name affiliation and in two minutes good afternoon. My name is Chris grow trong I'm the president and founder constructive insulting firm that specializes in blockchain could. Out of San Diego. He also and banking professionals for continuing education I think the things. I was actually one of the small that professor rally man was a. The initial virtual backed originally and I think some of the things that we need to they are. Talk they are censorship distance thank you know initially when we talked about like encryption and which some of the things are use and this. As a legal. I was created because of its ability to treat for information. That is a. First the first amendment right to have free speech part of that has to do with your ability to how you transact I think that's something that we should consider I also think that this model of how the web is work work and the data centric model that we have. Is to switch and seeing this news about web three users data this is where this. Is going in blocking helps enable. So what I heard also liminal the limiting of fractional reserve. That's something that's definitely very important and I think the collateral is ation. Of sets is also very something that needs to be looked into especially for the custodians in the space. But that when we talk. See see is are a- committee there the reason. Looking into I think really needs to be considered because when you look at tripartite agreements with creditors and- in. In the assets that are being issued or being sold to the public and the consumer in the protections to go on to the companies you have. Credit and against those ask. Portantino two one once a big point or virtual. In it you you can't necessarily tiling to that and I think it can be very Burzum burdensome for these companies who are looking to do that so as a person who came from. The tech industry and switched over into fifth tax I see that the students are I see that client back to. Was a compliance officer for. That the custodianship and intermediaries that we're all talking about is definitely one of the focuses that needs to happen for the specs so I really appreciate everyone's time I think. You know regulatory certainty that. Not having. Regulation really does increase. Angela Burnett opening. They're coming to get. I will pave the benefits of that community need to have a voice well I'm really excited to be able to continue taking apart and being an advocate for the space thinking. Great thank you. So with any other commenting and I want to thank everyone for purchase. A very special thank you to real Honda community college for hosting us for the students for the faculty and- an excellent I am. Waiting and make. Sure that can have these conversations in the state of Calipari elder. Thank you chairwoman alone and thank you all for coming sharing your thoughts in your perspectives again A. B. fourteen eighty nine produce but the idea to continue to work on it as a work in progress is in the final. Product this is something that we're going to continue to work on for time. Because when. She wary of there's a- now learning myself. For a continue discussions with both industry as well as regulators and the different apartments as well see well uniform l√† commission again I want to thank everybody for the time because I think this is a really discussion again. On a call. With that we will adjourn
