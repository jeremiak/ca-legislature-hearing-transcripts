ACOSTA SEEING EXAMPLES DIGITAL DIVIDE IS PREVENTING CALIFORNIANS EXCUSE ME FROM ENGAGING IN CRITICAL DIGITAL ACTIVITIES THE STUDENTS HAVING TO GO TO STARBUCKS PARKING OT TO GET THE WIFI CONNECTION DO YOU DO TO THE TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK OR OLDER CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE FAST ENOUGH INTERNET FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT COULD FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONNECTED. AND AS FOR TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION WE MUST DO BETTER THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE A LACK OF LONG TERM INVESTMENT IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY READY BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES IS A KEY DRIVER OF THE STING TO BUY. SPECIFICALLY BILL READ OF. THE BILL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND. TO BETTER ENABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO BE BUILT IN UNSERVED AREAS. THIS CHANGE IS CRITICAL- AND WILL BE ENABLING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND I. S. P.'S INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS OF ALL SIZES. TO APPLY FOR GRANTS AT THE SAME TIME INVEST IN THIS TECHNOLOGY. CURRENTLY THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BAND SERVICES FUND ARE TIED DIRECTLY TO LOW INTERNET SPEEDS MAKING MOST INTERESTED ENTITIES WHO WOULD LIKE TO DEPLOY. FASTER SPEEDS IN ELIGIBLE FOR THE GRANT FUNDS WE MUST LEVERAGE AND MAKE SMART INVESTMENTS WITH THE CURRENT PUBLIC DOLLARS FOR OUR SEATS FUTURE. IT ALSO ALLOWS THE PUBLIC UTILITIES. COMMISSION TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO FINANCE OPEN OUR HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. WHICH WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO BE ON PAR WITH INTERNATIONAL NORMS I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY AS WELL THE ACCEPTED SENATE POLICY COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS RELATED TO URBAN OR SUBURBAN.

FIBER CHECK THE CHANGES AT ELEVEN HAD WITHIN THE METRICS THERE WERE A REFLECTIVE OF ADVANCEMENT IN BROADBAND THAT OCCURRED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AT THAT THE MINIMUM STANDARD TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND DOWNLOAD AND TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND UPLOAD. BY THIS ONE SURE ABOUT THE ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT CURRENTLY INELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROGRAM BUT LACKS HIGH THREE AXIS WILL BE PART OF THE-LARGER INSTRUCTION PLAN. IT'S CREEK THIS. THE ELDERLY CRITICAL GIVEN THAT. SCALE AN AGGREGATION OF THE MAN FOR AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE THESE NETWORKS SELF SUFFICIENT FINANCIALLY AND ABLE TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INVESTMENT TO MATCH THE STATE EFFORT. IT ALSO A SPECIFICALLY.

HI I WOULD. THERE ARE LIKE NO PROVIDER CAN IF OF CALIFORNIA BETTER CURRENTLY PROVIDING SERVICE AT THAT SYMMETRICAL SPEED GLOBAL. IRONICALLY THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE AND AN APPLE CAN'T TO BUILD THEIR NETWORK TO AT TWENTY FIVE AND THREE SPEED WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE LAST MAN HOW AND SERVE HAS BEEN DEFINED THE BELL FELT. ONE FINANCE LOOKING CAN BE THREE FUNDING IN ORDER TO BUILD OUT A PROJECT BUILDING TO THE TWENTY FIVE THREE BUT NOT RENDER THAT AREA INELIGIBLE. FOR FUNDING. BE ACTOR DE. HAS DEFINED TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT SAYS AND THE AREA THOSE ROLE. CAN PROTECT THAT HAPPENED. WHICH CAN BE LIKELY CONTNUE TO REMAIN AT THE END OF THE LINE- AND LIKELY NOT HAVE THOSE NETWORKS APPARATED. INTERESTINGLY THE BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW FUNDING FOR OPEN ACCESS NETWORK AS IDENTIFIED BY THE AUTHOR BUT AT THE SAME TIME WOULD PROHIBIT THE OPEN ACCESS NETWORK FROM PROVIDING THEIR OWN. MY CAN ACTIVITY THAT WOULD REQUIRE AND NOW THEY'RE APPLE CAN'T TO THEN HAVE TO ACT AT THE A EXCEPT THAT THE OR- TO INVEST THEIR OWN MONEY IN ORDER TO CONNECT TO THAT OPEN ACCESS ONLINE. THAT ALSO SEEMS TO BE A VERY EFFICIENT WAY PROVIDE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY AND USING THE VERY SCARCE RESOURCES. THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OF IT. MANY THANK. JENNIFER SAID FROM A MORE FULL PROCESS WHERE THE MORE CAN A BY THE END OF CAN ALSO BE FACT INTO THE BAY N PARTICULAR THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS IN THE PROCESS AND NOT THE MAKING MANY KAMALA BALL THE TO THE ARGOS PROGRAM AND WE WOULD EXPECT A LOT OF MONEY TO COME TO CALIFORNIA TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WE ALSO HAVE- AT THE PPV CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT FIFTY TWO AB. FEEDING BEFORE IT THE TIME APPLICATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING TO BUILD OUT IN IT AND SERVE THE AREA THAT ARE CURRENTLY DEFINED THAT MANY THAT IS AVAILABLE WE ESTIMATE TO BE PAYING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND- THREE HUNDRED BILLION. IS THAT WHAT. AND THOSE APPLICATION THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THERE NO MONEY. TO FIND THE NEW REALLY RUN CAL ADVANCED SERVER FUND SO THE URGENCY OF THE LEGISLATION- DOES DOES NOT SEEN CAN PAN OUT GIVEN THAT THERE IS NO NEW MONEY THAT ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE PROGRAM- I WOULD. THE BILL THAT. ASIAN THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE PEACE TO AND RATE REGULATE OF FOR BROADBAND THAT IS AT THE PHYSICALLY CALL HIM BUT BY LAW AND CERTAINLY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS BILL FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE AT ELEVEN THIRTY AM WOULD AGAIN ENCOURAGE TO BE OFF AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TOO BAD THAT STOPPED BILL THIS YEAR HAVING MORE WHAT THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA WILL ACTUALLY BE ONE THE CURRENT. AT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT AND ONE THE FEDERAL MONEY HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU MS MCINTYRE I UNDERSTAND WE ALSO HAVE CARE BUSH AND CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS AS A MAN POSITION WHERE WITH US MODERATOR. PLEASE OPEN THAT TELEPHONE LINE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRED MEMBER COMMITTEE CARABUS FOR CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS- MORE COMMONLY KNOWN IN MANY COMMUNITIES THE BACKGROUND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO TESTIFY. OUR COMPANY IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST BROADBAND CABLE OPERATORS WITH MORE THAN FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP AND JUST SHY OF NINE THOUSAND PLEASE HEARING DATE. WE HAVE THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE ONLY BROADBAND CABLE PROVIDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CATHOLIC PROGRAM AS AN APPLICANT. IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BY PAUL OUR FIRST FORAY WE WERE AWARDED THREE SEPARATE GRANT FOR PROJECT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THEN THE CURRENT. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL WE FILED SIXTEEN APPLICATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE WANT THE AUTHOR THE BOND FOR THERE REALLY TO THINK AND- WITH THAT. HOWEVER WE MUST STILL OPPOSE THE BILL IN FACT. IF YOU ENACTED CELLS EFFECT WILL BE LESS PARTICIPATION IN THE CAPTIVE PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE- CABLE OPERATOR OTHER NOT MORE. BY THE RUSSIAN LEADER PROGRAMMER OR AND THROUGH THE PROCESS IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC IN A WAY THAT WILL DISCOURAGE PARTICIPATION WE URGE THE COMMITTEE. THAT WORK WITH OUR COMPANY TO ADDRESS THE MEDIA. NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS. I THINK THE CIVIC ISSUES WITH THE BELL I WILL BRIEFLY COVER A FEW. BIRTH THE BILL REQUIREMENTS AROUND. THESE ARE NOT. FEET IDENTIFY ANSWER. AS AREAS WITHOUT A- SERVICE THE THRESHOLD INTO FIVE POINT FIVE AND NOT GIVE HIGHER SPEED. ADDITIONALLY BILL. BASS PLAYING. NOTING FUNDED PROJECT MUST HAVE A GOAL OF ACHIEVING FUTURE PROOF INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH IS DEFINED BY NOT ONLY BE THRESHOLD BUT MINIMUM BLATANT THE REQUIREMENT. BY CHARTER THE NETWORK DELIVERING AND GIGABIT MATCH THAN WITH THE NINE FORTY OVER THIRTY FIVE MEGABYTES PER SECOND OUR ENTIRE SERVICE TERRITORY WOULD BE CONSIDERED ON CERTAIN BECAUSE WE DO NOT OPERATE SERVICE YOUR PACKAGE OF TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE. AND LEAVE THE THRESHOLD REQUIRED BY THE BILL ARE PROBLEMATIC AS WELL. BACK IN THE WHOLE SO ACTIVE THE BILL IS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION FOR OUR COMPANY AND POTENTIALLY EITHER. THE BILL PROPOSES TO ALLOW THE UC TO REQUIRE. OPEN PORTAL ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEM. WHICH FOR OUR COMPANY WE INCLUDE ARGUE SYSTEM MANDATING BUT ACCESS OF OUR CABLE NETWORK IS THAT ODDS WITH CERTAINLY PREVENT. CONTINUING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM CONGRESS SPECIFIED THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH CABLE SYSTEM OPERATORS WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE FACILITIES THE THIRD PARTIES. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT AT LIBERTY TO ESTABLISH NEW SHARING OBLIGATION. I THINK CABLE OPERATORS THAT WANT TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND RURAL AREAS AND USE THE CAST THE PROGRAM THE BILL THAT OUR NETWORK IN AREAS THAT ARE OTHERWISE UNECONOMIC. USER THE PROVISION FOR THE TEAR AYE AND PERHAPS OTHER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM WARNING THE GOALS AS BUILDING BROADBAND CENSORED AREA. WE CONTINUE TO WANT TO HAVE A ROLE IN BREAKING MADE BRINGING BROADBAND TO RURAL. AREAS WELL WE AGREE WITH THE SPONSOR ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL AND MY SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED THIS BILL IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE. FORTY REASONS AND OTHERS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE SB ELEVEN THIRTY IF HOUSING COMMITTEE TODAY AND INSTEAD AND ISSUED A ROGUE STAKEHOLDER WITH THE CAN BE CONDUCTED IN A MORE PURPOSEFUL DELIBERATE.

GOOD MORNING- THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS A LOT OF BANDS AND REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION SERVING RURAL CALIFORNIA AN- MISSION THANK YOU. LINE FORTY THREE FOUR THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HELLO PAM LIMITS ON BEHALF OF THE CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN Q. AT THIS TIME OKAY WELL THAT CONCLUDES OUR ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR Q. NA AND- I GUESS ALL LEAD OFF WITH A COUPLE QUESTIONS SENATOR. I WONDER IF YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE-OPPOSITION REFLECTING THE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW THE CASF IS FUNDED BY A SURCHARGE FROM INTEREST EIGHT PHONE AND VOIP SERVICES. ALL RIGHT NOW STATE STATUTE AUTHORIZES TO RETURN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS YEAH AND- WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY THAT THAT IS CURRENTLY OVER SCRIBE SO IN IF WE GREATLY EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THIS PROGRAM WHERE'S THE FUNDING TO FOR THOSE GRANTS GOING TO COME FROM. YES MISTER TURN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION THE FIRST THING I WILL JUST NOTE IS IT ASSUMES THAT EVERY PROJECT BE APPROVED AND SO- I HOPE THAT EVERY PROJECT AT THE APPROVED BUT USUALLY NOT EVERY PROJECT AS A FOR PROOF. I'M SO YES IT OVER THE COME OFF OF THE WORK FROM IT FIRST THAT AND IN SIXTY FIVE PREVIOUS THERE'S STILL TWO MORE YEARS COLLECT WORDS OF SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR- THE BUSINESS CHILI AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED THIRTY TWO IN THAT COULD BE GOOD IN THE FIGHT. THERE QUESTIONS AND I'M BOTH IT WITH CAUGHT AND IN MY HOUSE ABOUT A MORE OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST STANDING ON BUT DECISIONAL- DISCUSSIONS WITH VARIOUS- STAKEHOLDERS ON ON HOW WE CAN CONTINUE FUND- DIGITAL POLLUTION ALL OUTSIDE OF THE- THIS ONE BUT THE IS GOING TO PICK A WE'RE GONNA HAVE FOR SOMETIME TO COME SO DO YOU. THE CHARGE SHOULD BE OR THE NO SOURCES MEASURE POINT UP TO SEE A OF. I THINK WE KNOW THEN WEREN'T THE DISCUSSIONS I KNOW IT'S- I GATHER. THE BILL THAT DOES EXTEND THE FEE WELL SO WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTH OF OUR BILLS TO SEE HOW THEY CAN COME. EACH OTHER AND OUT ACTIVELY WORKED TOGETHER THAT. THANK YOU BY THE CONCERNED BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT- IF THE EXISTING PROGRAM ALREADY. OVERSUBSCRIBED THAT THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN SET THIS GOAL FOR OURSELVES WITHOUT THE MASSIVE. SOURCE OF REVENUE. AND YOU KNOW THE AYE AYE THAT'S A DISCUSSION AND WE NEED TO HAVE AT THE SAME TIME TO DISCUSS THE MERITS. OF CHANGING OUR GOALS YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THOSE. SO AT THAT THAT SO THAT'S A CONCERT AND I HAVE. I ALSO WONDER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS IT ANOTHER CONCERN THAT WE HEARD IN OPPOSITION. WHICH IT IS THE TECHNICAL. FIREMAN'S THAT ARE WRITTEN THIS BILL SO YOU HAVE. ACQUIRED ONE OF TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND SYMMETRIC OPAL UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM BANDWIDTH. NOW OF COURSE MOST CONSUMERS. UTILIZED DOWNSTREAM MUCH MORE THAN UPSTREAM IN FACT IT'S OVER 90% WHICH IS WHY A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES ARE ASYMMETRIC. BECAUSE THEY PRIORITIZE DOWNSTREAM DOWN WITH UPSTREAM THAT WITH. A WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN. A SYMMETRIC STANDARD FOR THIS DEFINITION. WELL WE ACTUALLY TOOK AMENDMENTS AND WE ARE DOWN TO TWENTY FIVE THREE WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL- STANDARD. AND SO- WE'RE TWENTY. THREE WITH GOAL OF TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE AND AS WE KNOW NOW. KIDS WITH FIVE YOU KNOW THERE'S FIVE OF US IN THE HOUSE ALL IN AS SOON. THE THOUGHT OF A DOWNSTREAM THREE OR ONE IS ACTUALLY EVEN OUTDATED. YOU NEED YOU KNOW I THINK- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FEDERAL FCC- WEBSITE. THE ACTUALLY VIED BUT NO ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED WHICH IS WHAT WE PUT IN HERE AS A GOAL AND- IN ADDITION TO THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS DAY AND AGE IN AN OPEN ENVIRONMENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE I'VE SEEN IN DOWNSTREAM SO. TELL YOUR TAKE A MOMENT TO CHAIR OF AN ISSUE THERE ARE ONLY FIVE THREE YES WELL THEY'RE NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND I DIDN'T SEE THEM IN THE BILL SO WHEN AND WHERE THOSE AMENDMENTS TAKEN THOSE WERE TAKEN AT- SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE. IN OKAY WELL IT'S THAT'S I WILL RE REVIEW THE BILL BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE TEXT OF THE BILL SAID SO I WILL LOOK INTO THAT SOME MORE COULDN'T WE TALK A BIT ABOUT LATENCY BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT SO YOU IN THE DEATH AND DEFINITION OF AN UNDERSERVED AREA YOU'VE GOT A DEFINITE THE DEFINITION INCLUDES LATENCY. TO BECOME SERVE LATENCY HAS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY LOW TO ALLOW REAL TIME INTERACTIVE APPLICATIONS. CAN EXPLAIN A BIT ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU BECAUSE- IT IT HAS. A VERY AMBIGUOUS MEETING TO ME I MEAN IT'S IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF. INTERACTIVE APPLICATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A FOR PLAYING POKER. THAT'S IT REQUIRES VERY- VERY HIGHLY CAN SEE IS SUFFICIENT- IF WERE VIDEO CONFERENCING- A MODERATE AMOUNT OF LATENCY A SUFFICIENT AND A FOR PLAYING A VIDEO GAME LIKE FOR NOT ONLINE YOU NEED VERY LOW LATENCY SO- SO CAN CAN YOU TALK ABOUT. WHY THAT WHICH IS IN THERE AND WHY IT'S NOT MORE SPECIFIC. THE LOOSELY AND ALSO- REACH OUT TO ERNESTO AS OF WELL IF HE HAS ADDITIONAL INPUT BUT- AS I MENTIONED OF IN ADDITION TO THE BILL MANY. KIDS HAVE TO BE AN INTERACTIVE. GUILLEMETS WE HAVE NO CHOICE AND GENTLY DISTANCE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. NO MY CHILD WAS JUST ON A MINECRAFT CODING CLASS. IN YOUR- NEED HIGHER THE BILL. RIGHT AS WE AS WE HAVEN'T. I AND SO THAT IS IN THE REAR IS THAT WE NEED TO ADD THESE TECHNICAL ISSUES AND WE ALL CAN CONTINUE INVESTING PUBLIC DOLLARS IN SLOW SPEEDS THESE ARE PUBLIC DOLLARS REPAIR FUNDS TAXPAYER DOLLARS BEING UTILIZING NEED TO BE INVESTED IN THIS FUTURE PROOF TECHNOLOGY. WITH THESE TECHNICAL CHANGES BUT- ERNESTO IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL INPUT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT AS WELL. CERTAINLY SENATOR THANK YOU- NOT SENATOR DID THE EXPLAIN KIND OF THE LEAGUE AND SEE HOW THAT WORKS RIGHT NOW WITH WITH THESE NETWORKS- THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION DOES A FAIRLY HOLISTIC ANALYSIS ALL THE DIFFERENT TACK NEVER TAKE TECHNOLOGIES AND IN THE FUTURE PROOFING. I INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THAT TWENTY AVERAGING TWENTY MILLISECONDS OR LESS IS ESSENTIALLY KIND OF THE INDUSTRY STANDARD WHAT LOW LATENCY IS- IT MET BY A CABLE NETWORK THAT ARE HAVE IDENTIFIED WERE BUILT WITH THEM AND IT'S MEANT BY FIVE THE HOME NETWORKS EVEN IN IN IN VERY DIFFICULT SEVERAL MARKETS. I IT THIS STANDARD THAT- SPACEX IS SHOOTING FOR AS PART OF THEIR DEPLOYMENT OF LITTLE LITTLE EARTH ORBIT- BROADBAND NETWORKS. LEAN INTENSELY THE- THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT MAY TAKE THE DATA THE MOVE FROM COME FROM POINT TO POINT. FIVE VAN. YOU COME. FROM WORKS OKAY. IT FROM THE WIRE OR THE OF CAN YOUR WITH. YOU HIGHER OR THAT LIKE LOT OF ROLE RIGHT ARE DEPEND ON NOW. STREAMING HIGHWAY TO BECAUSE TAKES A VERY LONG TIME THE INFORMATION REACHED THE SO BEFOREEVENTUALLY MAKE IT BACK DOWN TO EARTH TO CONNECT WEAPON THAT. OR ON. YOUR COPPER WIRE NETWORKS YUR DSL NETWORKS WHICH- A LOT OF THE FRICTION IT IN THE WIRE MR COCHRAN IF I COULD ASK SINCE YOU'RE AN EXPERT AND YOU BROUGHT UP LOWER ORBIT SATELLITES. I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS A GOAL OF GETTING LEADING LATENCY BELOW TWENTY MILLISECONDS SO WOULDN'T THAT QUALIFY. UNDER THE STANDARD. IT WOULD. IN TERMS OF THE- QUESTION OF- SAID THE NUMBERS BUT THE THING WITH LOW OR SATELLITE AND KIND OF THE LIMIT THERE IS. IT CAPACITY INCREASING SERVICES SO IF. PROVING BOB REQUIREMENT BUT THE TV NEEDS LOOK INTO. LAST PART OF IT AFTER THE PROOF WILL OF INFRASTRUCTURE RAMPS UP SPENDING- BECAUSE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THE BASICS AND KIND OF THE OTHER LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITE PLANS DON'T REALLY RELY ON GOVERNMENT MONEY TO BUILD IT OUT AND IF THERE'S SOME REASONS FOR THAT NOW EXPLAIN THAT- IF YOU WISH. BY ALTERING THEIR POTENTIAL YOU YOU'VE ANSWERED MY QUESTION BOB BUT IT'S JUST OKAY I DON'T TECHNICAL DISCUSSION HERE BUT- I HAVE A CONCERN THAT THOSE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS MIGHT NOT MIGHT NEED TO BE REWORKED. AND IN PARTICULAR I MEAN AT THE ARE. YOU KNOW ME I'M A TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND- I OWN A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY I'M CERTAINLY VERY INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO BROUGHT. APPROVED AN INTERNET I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WERE VERY FAR. ABOUT WAY WE GO IT. IN SO MY FIRST CONCERN IS I RAISES THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN ATTACK ATTACHED A FUNDING SOURCE TO THIS. AND THE EXISTING PROGRAMS ALREADY OVERSUBSCRIBED. BUT MY SECOND CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE. ARE PUTTING OUR THUMB ON THE SCALES AND- WRITING THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS TO FAVOR ONLY ONE DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS FIBER. AND WE HAVE OTHER DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES THAT MIGHT BE. EVEN MORE APPROPRIATE FOR SERVING CURRENTLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES LIKE WHAT LOWER WITHOUT RIVER ORBIT SATELLITES I MEAN THAT THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE ONCE YOU PUT THOSE SATELLITES IN ORBIT THAT COULD BE A VERY APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE. YEAH AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR. TO JUDGE AND SAY THE FIBERS THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO. AWARD GRANTS FOR- SO WE- BUT- CHERISH REGULATE IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT THAT THE FUTURE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVEN'T DICTATED FIBER. JUST IS FUTURE PROOF TECHNOLOGY WOULD COULD WHICH COULD BE A HYBRID. WHICH IS MANY AT THE WHICH MANY OF THE CAMP MANY SAY THAT THE HALF. AND SO UP WITH THOSE SPECIFIC. AS AS MENTIONED TWENTY FIVE THREE AND THE LATE. YOU CAN SEE ISSUE AS WELL SO. THERE ARE. NO KNOWLEDGE TO YOUR POINT OKAY AND I WERE VERY CLEAR. THE BILL WOULD YOU ARE MOVING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. FOR ME FIVE. PERCENT DOWN TO AND THREE MAKE A PER SE. UPSTREAM CRAP. OKAY OTHER FURTHER. I MISS STARS ORBIT. I SHARE YOUR CONCERN I WITH CALIFORNIANS DISTANCE LEARNING- DURING COVE IN NINETEEN AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF PARENTS WHO ARE COLOR WORKING ENSURING THAT WE HAVE BROADBAND ACCESS TO EVERYONE IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE- I DO I HAVE A CONCERN OF USING THE WORD FUTURE PROOFING BECAUSE IF WE LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE IN TWENTY YEARS SO MAYBE THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN GET NEUTRAL AND THE LANGUAGE AROUND WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THERE IS- BECAUSE I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT DISINCENTIVE EYES FROM SERVING RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES SO THE FIRST THING. THE SECOND THING IS I WANT TO REITERATE TWENTY FIVE THREE NOT TWENTY FIVE FIVE SEVEN THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. COULD YOU TOUCH ON THIS BECAUSE I KNOW ERNESTO WHO WAS ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO HEAR HIM SO MAYBE YOU CAN REPEAT- ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IS THE MISUSE OF IT WHEN YOU CHECK RE CHANGE THE STANDARD TO TWENTY FIVE THREE. THE MISUSE THAT COULD HAPPEN I THINK MAYBE THIS IS THE OF THE CONCERN OF SOME OF THE COMMITTEE. THE MISUSE FOR MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS FOR SOME OF THINGS WHERE YOU'RE JUST EXPANDING ALREADY PROFITABLE AREAS. AND NOT REALLY GETTING AT THE LACK OF PROVISION OF BROADBAND ACCESS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND THE TRULY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO COULD YOU ADDRESS HOW YOUR BILL IS TURNING THAT HOW YOU PROVIDING THE MIST DOSE. OF THIS FILE. AND THEN ALSO. CAN YOU MAYBE GIVE US ALSO THE HISTORY OF THE FUNDING ISSUE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN GOING ON AND YOU SAID YOU WERE STILL WORKING ON IT AND SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY ALSO TO TALK ABOUT HOW THAT'S EVOLVED- AND MAYBE WHAT WE CAN EXPECT AS A COMMITTEE IF THIS BILL GOES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY SURE AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE UNSERVED THERE'S NO SHIFT IN PRIOR FROM PREVIOUS. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A SURVEY OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE COMPLETELY OFF THE GRID UNSERVED AND SO THAT WILL REMAIN A PRIORITY HERE- IN THIS BILL- OF COURSE WE'VE EXPANDED WHAT UNSERVED ACTUALLY- LOOKS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A HIGHER THRESHOLD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN VERY HIGH POVERTY AREAS TO BE ACCESS FUNDS UP OR COULD HAVE BEEN A HOLD OF THAT YOU ACCESS THESE FUNDS AT NO THERE WERE NO WERE NUMBER. TEN FOR SO WE'RE EXPENSE TO GET FOLKS ON COMPLETELY BE WE START BUILDING AGAIN WITH SPEEDS OF TWENTY FIVE THREE AT LEAST IN THIS THAT IS YOUR. HOW ARE. HOW HI JIM THAT'S GONNA WORK IN REAL LIFE IF BILL PUT INTO LAW I HAD A THAT HOW DO THEY PRAYER THEY SAY. ALL UP WITH IN THE WORLD. NO BROADBAND CAN BE THEY GET A PROOF AND ALL YES IS THERE ARE NONE THEN WE CAN GO TO THE INCOME. CONSTRAINED UNDER COMMUNITIES AT ONLY ABOUT. THAT YEAH THAT IS CORRECT OKAY THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITY WITH YOU SEE RIGHT NOW THIS FIFTY FOUR APPLICATIONS I THINK ALMOST ALL OF THEM. OR ABOUT COMMUNITIES OF THAT ARE UNSERVED BUT AGAIN- YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF UP APPLICATION HICK UPS THEY MAY NOT MAKE IT THERE'S A LOT OF VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT THE PC MAY NOT APPROVE ALL ALL. YOU KNOW FIFTY FOUR OF THEM- BUT I HOPE THEY DO- THEIR OWN ROLE UNSERVED AREAS- AND THEN THE SECOND TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT FUNDING OF COURSE- THIS IS A- BUT THE TRAJECTORY FROM. THESE A ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA BILL WHO BASICALLY LOOK LOOK AT THESE FUNDS A THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. WE'RE JUST- PROGRAMMATIC THE CHANGING YOU KNOW WHAT THAT. IS BUT- WHAT WE WANT TO DO OF COURSE IS HAVE FULL DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD WITH- LIMóN KURT IF YOU TWO ARE VERY MUCH INVEST THIS IS THE DISK. AND OF YOU WHO WOULD TO BE INVESTED IS AS WELL WE'D LOVE TO HAVE THAT TO TALK ABOUT NOT JUST THE CALIFORNIA SERVICES FUND. AS WE KNOW THAT UP. YOU KNOW THE- SIR ONE IS ONE OPTION BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER GRANTS AVAILABLE THERE'S TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AT THE FCC IS JUST NOW- ALLOWING FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN. AS WELL AS- DIFF DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS AND HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE BOTH FEDERAL. UP A FEDERAL DOLLARS AND HAVE AN ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT- OTHER MEASURES TO CONTINUE FUNDING THESE PRIORITIES. SO THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION HAPPENING ON THAT I KNOW THE SENSE OF URGENCY IN THIS BUT WE HAVE TO START MAKING THESE. CHANGES NOW IN MY OPINION. IF WE ADDRESS MY QUESTION ABOUT ANSWER ATHLETIC QUESTIONS AT ONE TIME IS. LIKE PARKS THEM OUT- WHAT ABOUT THE MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS HOW ARE YOU PROVIDING ABUSE OF. THIS FINE FOR PROJECTS OR MAYBE. A YOU KNOW AN UNSCRUPULOUS ACTOR WHEN YOU WANT TO GET MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS OR WHATEVER AND SO IT DOESN'T REALLY GO TO. YOU KNOW THEY SAY IT QUALIFIES. BUT IT DOESN'T GO TO SERVE THE PEOPLE WE WANT SO. HOW ARE HOW'S YOUR BILL PREVENTING THE MISUSE. WELL WE DON'T SPECIFICALLY CALL OUT THE MISUSE BUT I THINK WHAT- YOU KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A RAMP IT AS MAYBE SOME BELIEVE. I THINK MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS IN MY OPINION HAVE BEEN- VERY GOOD PROJECTS LIKE SAN LEANDRO HAS A GREAT MIDDLE MILE PROJECT ANCHORED TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT. THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE- FUTURE PROOF TECHNOLOGY TO ABOUT LIKE A TWO OR THREE MILE RADIUS FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AT A VERY LOW COST. AND SO MIDDLE MILE- COUPLED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO NOW APPLY FOR THESE- THESE FUNDS I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD. OPPORTUNITY MORE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THAN. THE NEGATIVE BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN AND WE CAN LOOK THAT UP TO THE PC. RIGHT MISTER LOW AND THEN MISTER RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE I SORT OF FEEL LIKE I'M BACK AT HOME BECAUSE WE'RE SORT OF PEEKING OUT ON THIS TECHNICAL ISSUES RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT THE SENATOR YOU ALSO HAVE A TECH BACKGROUND SO UNDERSTANDING YOU AWARE THIS IS COMING FROM I THINK ALSO AHEAD. OF COMMENTING PREVIOUSLY AND SHARE THE CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO SHIFTING THE FOCUS FROM UNDERSERVED AND RURAL A TO THAT OF THE- OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE LIKE IN MY COMMUNITY AND SILICON VALLEY AND SO THE CONCERNED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THAT INTENT TO SERVE. OF THE ROLE COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO THAT OF THE SERVICE FUND AND THAT BEING- OF THE MAIN FOCUS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT OF THE FOCUS ON CONSTRUCTION OF VERSES THAT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO REALLY PROVIDE THAT HAVE THIS AND PERHAPS YOU CAN. PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT ON THAT. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT POINT AS WELL- TO ENSURE THAT EOPLE DON'T JUST HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THAT THAT THEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY CONNECTED- SO. I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION- TOOK ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR WIFI'S AND HOT SPOTS AND WILL YOU KNOW THE FUND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT- ESPECIALLY IN THESE. AREAS THAT ARE HARD HIT SO I THINK- THAT'S WHAT EXACTLY WHY WE WANTED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT- THEY HAD ACCESS TO THIS BUT ALSO COULD DO THAT WORK- WITH US AND THROUGH THIS FUN SO. ABSOLUTELY AND DISTANCE LEARNING AND DIGITAL CURRICULUM AND ALL THAT SO ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE MONA YES SENATORS I SPOKE EARLIER TODAY- REGARDING THE FUNDING MECHANISM THAT'S MY BIGGEST ISSUE I'M STRUGGLING WITH HIS BILL THAT IF SOME OF THESE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES DON'T SEEM TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN RELY ON FOR FUTURE YEARS WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE AND COMMITTEES LIKE MINE AND OTHERS BECAUSE I WOULD HATE FOR OUR FUTURE- REVENUE SOURCES BE TAKEN AWAY FROM. KERN IS LIKE MINE I KNOW WE KIND OF DON'T WANT SOME REPETITIVE WE TALKED A READING SOME OTHER COLLEAGUES AT SOME ISSUES REGARDING THE FUNNY PART BUT THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD REALLY WANT TO COME TO GRIPS ON MY COMMITTEE IF THIS BILL MOVES FOR ON THAT IT WOULD IMPACT COMMUNITY LIKE MYSELF OF. GOD FORBID HAPPENS AT THE OTHERS NO UNDER ADDITIONAL FUNDING RESOURCES THAT CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM. IN FUTURE YEARS. ABSOLUTELY AND DULY NOTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- I YOU KNOW CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS AND AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE FUNDING- THERE AGAIN IS STILL TWO YEARS AGAIN THAT'S A DROP IN THE BUCKET A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WE KNOW WILL GO. IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE THERE'S ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH THIS HOUSE TO ENSURE THAT WE LOOK AT EXTENDING THE FUN AND OR ADDITIONAL- FUNDING CONVERSATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE CALIFORNIA SERVICES FUND. AGAIN PULLING DOWN LEVERAGING DOLLARS THERE'S A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR ROLE- FUND A GRANT OPPORTUNITY. THROUGH THE FCC THAT COULD BE LEVERAGED TO THIS FUN ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PROGRAM ACTUALLY.

THAT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY SUPPORTED BY BOTH. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. IN IT'S THE CULMINATION OF OVER A YEAR OF WORK WITH COUNTLESS MEETINGS AND PHONE CALLS- WITH STAKEHOLDERS. DURING LAST YEAR'S POWER OUTAGE TO BUCKLE AT ITS PEAK NEARLY TWO MILLION TWO MILLION IN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. HAVE THEIR LAND LINE CELLPHONE INDOOR CABLE PHONE SERVICE INTERRUPTED. AT ONE EXTREME EXAMPLE WAS IN MARIN COUNTY WHO HAD 57% OF ITS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY. CELL PHONE TWO. ADAM SERVICE AT. ONE DURING A POWER RIGHT OFF THEN. PHONE AS WE ALL KNOW OUR OUR LIFELINE IT'S HOW WE KEEP INTO WITH THE OF THE AND HOW WE RECEIVE EMERGENCY ALERTS IT'S TIME CALIFORNIA STEPS UP AND DOES THE RIGHT THING IN MANDATE CELL TOWERS HAVE BACKUP POWER THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT CHECKING YOUR FACEBOOK STATUS IT TRULY IS ABOUT LIFE OR DEATH. IN CURRENTLY ONE CELL TOWERS AND COMMUNICATE TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE GO DOWN AFFECTING NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OR THE ABILITY FOR EMERGENCY OFFICIALS IT'S AN EMERGENCY ALERTS CITIZENS HAVE NO BACK UP TO TURN TO SB FOUR THIRTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP AN IMPORTANT BACK UP RULES FOR TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE LOCATED IN TIER TWO OR TIER THREE HI FIRE THREAT ZONES SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE STANDARDS VERY QUICKLY WOULD INCLUDE. REALLY SHOULD PROVIDE A MINIMUM PROPERTY LINE FOR BACK POWER FOR A- NET. NO LESS IN SEVEN TWO HOUR WE ORIGINALLY WERE LOOKING AT EVERY CELL PHONE TOWER THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE WORKING WITH INDUSTRY IT SIMPLY CREATING A MINIMUM STANDARD OF SERVICE DURING THESE OUTAGES. WIRELINE PROVIDERS SHALL PROVIDE MINIMUM SERVICE OF AT LEAST SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF BACKUP POWER FOR CRITICAL FACILITIES SPECIFICALLY OUTLINED IN THE BILL NOW THIS THESE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN. GREATLY NARROWED WE'RE LOOKING NOW JUST AT HOSPITALS AND POLICE STATIONS AND FIRE STATION. FOR THE QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS RURAL HEALTH CLINICS IN UTILITIES SUCH AS WATER SEWER AND ELECTRIC AT THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE CPC TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS WHERE PROVIDERS CAN IDENTIFY FACILITIES. NAT CANNOT COMPLY WITH REQUIREMENTS AND AUTHORIZED TO PC WAIVER DELAY IMPLEMENTATION ESSENTIALLY THIS DOES. IS IF A TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY SAYS THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS THEY'RE ABLE SENATE A WAIVER ESSENTIALLY IN THAT. TO THE PUBLIC YOU TO PLEASE COME. IN FOR MONTHS- BOTH IT AND I'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND I KNOW THAT A GOOD FOR OF US WE ARE SHOULD OF. OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT AS WELL THE INDUSTRY IN OUR OFFICES HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH ON. TO NORTH TO ADD SOME WORKABLE AND IF THE AND I THINK THAT WE- MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON THE NAME IS TO PROVIDE. INDUSTRY MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ACHIEVE THEIR REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THIS BILL BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT ENHANCES THE PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN THEY COME THEY COME TO DEPEND. ON THE WORK FORMS WE SHOULD TO THE OF BATTERY. REQUEST FOR A FROM. YOUR ENGAGEMENT WE'VE. ALSO CLARIFIED THAT THE BACKUP. AT POWER ONLY NEED FOR BY BASS LEVEL SERVICE HERE'S WHAT THIS BASIC LEVEL SERVICE HERIS HOUSE TO FIND TO MAKE PHONE CALLS SUCH AS NINE ONE ONE.

YOUR CHAIR- WE SPENT I THINK A HALF DOZEN MEETINGS AND PHONE CALLS OVER THE LAST- SIX MONTHS ON THIS ISSUE DEEP ENGAGEMENT- HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT TRYING TO FIND ACCOMMODATION AND COMPROMISED. AND I THINK THAT THE BILL BEFORE YOU REPRESENTS THAT. LISTEN THAT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF NOBODY WANTS THEM. THEY'RE A NEW PHENOMENON IN OUR WORLD. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE UTILITIES- LIKE TO DO AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMUNITY- FEELS LIKE IT'S THEIR FAULT- THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT- THAT WERE EXPECTED. JUST A FEW YEARS AGO BUT THERE BEFORE US AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF- WHEN THEY HAPPEN OURS ARE SERIOUS- NOT SMALL THINGS IT'S BIG THINGS LIFE. SAVING THINGS AND- WE WORKED ON THIS BILL I MEAN THEY THE ASK THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION IS THIS. THINK ABOUT YOUR MOM YOUR DAD YOUR GRANDPARENTS- WHEN THE POWER GOES OFF AND THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE A WAY TO GET NOTIFICATION THAT THEY ARE IN DANGER. AND THEY CAN'T HEAR AT. FOR THEY NEED A HELP AND THEY GET ON THEIR DEVICE TO ASK FOR IT AND THEY CAN'T. GET THROUGH. THAT THE ABSENCES REALLY. HOW ARE WE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PER.

INDUSTRY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO WHAT'S BEFORE THIRTY ONE. AT THE OFFICE OF INDICATED WE HAVE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY. BUT SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL CONCERNS REMAIN. WIRELESS CARRIERS HAVE MADE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS AND INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN CRITICAL COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND EMERGENCY THEN THE PAY FOR THE WILD HIRED. AND HE HAD HE HAS A BAND OF ON SIX ONE FORESEEABLE BREAD AND ACTED TO. THERE IS NO GREATER. TO MAINTAIN SERVICE DURING EMERGENCY THE COMPETITION TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDING A PUBLIC SAFETY PART. LEGISLATION IS NOT NEEDED FOR THAT TO HAPPEN AND IT BEYOND THE JURISDICTIONAL REACH OF THE STATE. OUR SHARED GOAL IS TO PAY MAINTAIN SERVICE OUR COVERAGE NUMBER. DOES NOT REQUIRE HAVING A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF BACKUP POWER ON EACH DEL CITING THOUSANDS OF SMALL CELLS WHERE IT IS OBJECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE. THE INDUSTRY HAS COMMITTED SEVERAL THIRTY WOMEN MEN'S BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FUNDAMENTAL. MANY WIRELESS LOCATIONS ARE COVERED BY MULTIPLE SITES WITH THE OVERLAPPING NETWORK THAT CAN OFFLOAD INTO YOUR TRAFFIC WHEN IMPACT. SOME WIRELESS LIKELY LOCATED IN AREAS WHERE TICKS GENERATORS HAD TAKE THE INSTALL WHILE OTHERS REQUIRE MORE DOUBLE SOLUTIONS BASED UPON PERMITTING AND OTHER FACTORS. THAT MAY INCLUDE COMBINATIONS OF STICK GENERATOR PORTABLE GENERATORS AND BACKED OUT OF. SB THIRTY THIRTY FOUR THIRTY ONE FAILED BY REQUIRING AN ADDITIONAL ON THAT THE JURY AND AFFORDABLE FOR PROCESS. LOOKING AT AND APPROVING OR DISAPPROVING BACKUP POWER EACH OF MANY THOUSANDS OF. SUCH A PROCESS WASN'T BACK REJECTED BY THE BEAUTY IN ITS RECENT BACK ABOUT. WHAT WERE LANGUAGE CAN BE FOUND ON PAGE FOR THE BILL SECTION THE ONLINE TWENTY FOUR. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE OFFERED A WORKABLE SOLUTION BY COMBINING TEXTURED BEGINI AND REMOVING THE WAIVER LANGUAGE. BUT THAT HAS NOT FAR BEEN REJECTED. MANDATING AN ONEROUS CPUC WAIVER PROCESS ARE NECESSARILY DELAYED CARRIER REFERENCE TO ADDRESS RESILIENCY NEED. WORKING IN DIRECT CONFLICT THAT THE AUTHOR STATED INTENT FOR THE LEGISLATION. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THE ADDITION OF BASIC INTERNET BROWSING FOR THE MINIMUMS MINIMUM SERVICE HI MY ONE BOY AND TEXT. DO I DURING AN EXTRA THE FBI THE BEND IN WHICH BROUGHT WHILE COMMERCIAL POWER SHUT DOWN. IT MAY NOT BE. TO MAINTAIN INTERNET SERVICES WITHOUT. NEGATIVE IMPACTING PRIORITY ACT AS THE NINE ONE ONE AND FIRST RESPONDER SERVICES. THE BILL OF VOICE SERVICES. RIDLEY THIRTY THREE READ. AS WELL AS A THE PEACE TO FIX THAT I. THERE ARE CERTAIN FASTER WORK WILL A POP TO MAKE Y. SERVER. INCLUDING EXTEND COMMERCIAL POWER OUTAGES. MEMBERS THIS IS THE ONLY POP POLITICS MAYBE THIS BILL WILL EVER STATE. OF COURSE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OFFERS THE COMMITTEE AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TO MAKE SURE THE POLICY THERE IN PLACE TO PROVIDE THE BEST ENVIRONMENT TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES. WE ALL AGREE ON THE GOAL OF MAINTAINING WIRELESS SERVICE DURING DISASTERS. COLLABORATE I GET UP BY THE OBSTACLES TO THAT GOAL AND WAYS TO REMOVE THOSE OBSTACLES. BOTTOM ON WORKABLE MAY. THANK THANK YOU MR CARSON I UNDERSTAND WE ALSO HAVE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION CARROLL AMERICAN TIRE FROM C. C. T. A MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD OVER THAT LINE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CAROLINE MCINTYRE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION- WEEK YOU ARE OPPOSED TO AT THE FOUR THREE ONE- BEFORE I GET INTO THE SPECIFICS THAT TO Y. HOWEVER I DO WANT TO THANK SENATORS MCGUIRE AND SENATOR GLACIER. FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE- IN TRYING TO ATTRACT AT THE MANY ISSUES THAT WE BREAK AND WE HAVE MADE. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A FEW REMAINING CONCERNED WITH THE. BILL THAT IS CURRENTLY IN PRINT. AND AT THE RELATES THE PER FACILITIES THAT THE- AT. WILL BE. TO PROVIDE BACKUP POWER FOR THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK- WHILE THE LIST HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THE AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE STILL SOMEWHAT BROAD IN BUT HOPE TO WORK WITH THE SENATORS TO CLARIFY. THE ACTUAL DEFINITION OF A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER ANY WILL PLANET- THE DEFINITION THAT IS CURRENTLY PROVIDED IS EXTREMELY PRIDE IN WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT. TO IDENTIFY WHAT EXACTLY WHAT THE TEL AVIV WE ARE TALKING ABOUT- IN A- TO OBJECT BE. WAIVER PROCESS THAT HAS. BILL FOR I DIRECT THE FACT THAT MAY IN THE CURE YOUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE BACKUP POWER INSTEAD THAT WE HAD REQUESTED SPECIFIC CRITERIA THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MAD IN ORDER FOR ACT TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE BACKUP POWER AND THERE. THE DIRECTION OR NATIVE AFTER SITUATION. THOSE WOULD INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN PER MATT- FOR BOTH FIGHTING AND THE AIR QUALITY ISSUES- AND IT WOULD BE HAPPY BUT HAVE TO ENSURE THAT IT IS SAFE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES TO GET INTO THE AREA IN ORDER TO DO REFILLING- WE WOULD WANT TO RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION FROM THE ELECTRIC UTILITY. THAT THEY DO IN FACT INTEND TO SHUT OFF THE POWER AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ANY FACILITY THAT WE ARE BEING REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BACKUP POWER TO THE NET FOR. ALSO HAD THEIR OWN BACK THAT POWER SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY UTILIZE THE COMMUNICATION SERVICE WANTED TO PROVIDE TO THEM UNLESS THEY HAVE THAT THEIR BACKUP POWER ON SITE IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT THERE BUT- I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE IN FACT STATISTICALLY REQUESTED AN EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY. IN THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS FAIR TO PROVIDE ELECTRIC UTILITIES LIABILITY PROTECTION BY WAY OF ALLOWING THEM TO SHUT OFF THE POWER AND THEN NOT PROVIDE ACT WITH A SIMILAR TYPE OF LIABILITY PROTECTION. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE OUT OUT IN THE SAME WEATHER CONDITIONS TRANSPORTING FUEL THE MANY GENERATORS IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR NETWORK UP AND RUNNING AND THEN LASTLY WE WENT AFTER. THAT THE LEGISLATION. FOOD WHAT WELL I CALL AT DAY. BYE WEEK THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD BE. TO REPORT TO LIVES OF ON THE RAMP FROM. OF THE- POWER PROVISIONS AND- THE WOULD BE. TO HOLD EVIDENTIARY HEARING BEFORE CHANGINGTHAT SET UP WELL AND IMPOSING A NEW SET OF REQUIREMENTS. WE LIVE HERE TO BE AB SOME RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THE INDUSTRY WILL BE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COMPLY HERE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS.

I WE HEAR TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE FROM THE CHILD THAT RURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE AND I THINK THEY'RE QUITE DIFFERENT SO I GENERALLY NOT A SUPPORTER OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT I THINK WE DO HAVE OUR ABILITY TO DO WE HAVE TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN WE HAD THE LILAC HOLES FIRE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE HAD PEOPLE WHO DID IT FOR THEIR POWER WAS OUT THEIR CELL PHONE- DIDN'T GET ANY RECEPTION THEY COULDN'T GET LEADING GET THEIR VALUATION NOTICES SO I THINK OUR MINIMUM DUTY AND THE INTENT OF THIS BILLS RIGHT SAYING THERE'S A MINIMUM LEVEL INFORMATION WHEN WE DN'T HAVE PROPER IN THE GROUND ANYMORE THE PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE. I DO THINK IT'S DIFFERENT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBMIT SOMETHING THE OFFICE CAN CONTINUE AS YOU CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BILL- THE OPPOSITION BY UP A POINT THAT I THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY. TO FOR YOUR CLARIFY BECAUSE I THINK THE CENTER AND I HAD A LONG CONVERSATION THE WEEKEND- WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S A WILDFIRE SO DEVASTATING THAT THEY CAN'T- PROVIDER. CAN NOT GUARANTEED BACKUP POWER BECAUSE IT BE TOO DANGEROUS FOR THE FOLKS TO GO IN. AND DO THAT WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE UNDER YOUR BELT. I NEVER SEND THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND AGAIN TO DEPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION- THIS WEEKEND SO THAT HAPPENS QUITE A BIT IN FACT OVER THE LAST THIRTY SIX MONTHS- EIGHTEEN T. FOR EXAMPLE- HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO A ZONE BECAUSE EITHER- THERE IS STILL ACTIVE FIRE. OR OR- TO CHANGE YOUR IS ON A ROAD TO BE ABLE TO GET IN. SO THAT WOULD BE ACCORDING. BETWEEN STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THAT TELECOMMUNICATIONS TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDER IN FACT. THE BILL THAT WE ALL PASSED LAST YEAR SB. SIX SEVENTY ONE TO SAY THANK YOU TO MULTI WHO SUPPORTED THAT THEY'LL- A REQUIRES NOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES BEING CONSTANT CONTACT WHEN THERE IS AN OUTAGE IN SO THERE WOULD BE AN ABILITY- SOME FLEXIBILITY OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE UNABLE TO GET INTO AN AREA. TO BE COMMUNITY. BETWEEN COST. ABOUT IN THAT WOULD UP AND RUNNING IN CONSEQUENCE CATION WITH OPERA. CENTER AS WELL AS A LOCAL EMERGED SERVICES. YEAH SO WHAT TEMPORE FOR ME. IS THAT. WHEN THE PROVIDER TRIES TO DO IT OF COURSE THAT THERE FOR THAT THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY UNDUE CONSEQUENCES. I THINK THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE THAT'S GONNA COME NATURALLY FROM THE MARKET IN SOME AREAS THAT WON'T. BRING THAT IS SOMETHING THE OTHER THING I HAD ABOUT WAS ABOUT THE WAIVER PROCESS YEAH- YOU KNOW SOMEONE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING EXTRA LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY IN HERE. ON PEOPLE I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOME BECAUSE I DO THINK IN SOME AREAS OF STATE WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF SERVICE- BUT I WILL WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE WAIVER AND YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IT'S NOT ON THIS IS UNNECESSARY AND BURDENSOME. BUT GETS AT THE CORE OF WHAT YOU WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THEN SHARED SO- THIS WAIVER PROCESS. THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY INDUSTRY IN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT BEEN GRAPPLING WITH AND WORKING THROUGH THIS IS INITIATIVE WE SPENT SOME TIME WITH THIS WEEKEND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. SO LOOK THE CHAIR IN OUR OFFICES CREATED A WAIVER SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO HELP PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO INDUSTRY RIGHT BECAUSE INDUSTRIES COMING BACK TO US PROVIDE CERTAINTY INDUSTRY REGARDING THEIR ABILITY TO GET RELIEF. FOR WAIVERS- AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY ON THIS WHATEVER PROCESS. AND IT WAS A PUT INTO THE BILL TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY THAT THE ASSEMBLY WILL JUST MENTIONED BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED EIGHTEEN TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. ON THE MODIFICATION OF THE BILL AND IF IT'S ALRIGHT- MADAM AS SOMEONE FOR THE ONE ITEM I SAY. IT IS. WE JUST HEARD THAT THERE A REASON THIS BILL. THAT I DID WANT EVERYONE TO BE. MORE THAN REASON WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TYPE OF ISSUES. SO IN FACT WE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR THAT WE PARK. WE DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD. INDUSTRY WAS IN ON MY OFFICE SEVERAL TIMES INCLUDING A CTIA. THEY SAID THERE WAS NO REASON THAT THIS BILL WAS NEEDED. FAST FORWARD TO THESE MASSIVE POWERSHOT OFFICE TWO MILLION PEOPLE TWO MILLION PEOPLE LAND LINE CABLE AND SO CUSTOMERS HAD NO ABILITY TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE. IT COULDN'T GET EMERGENCY ALERTS THEY COULDN'T DIAL NINE ONE ONE THEY COULDN'T- ALSO GET EMERGENCY TEXT MESSAGES FROM THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES. SO I'M A BIG BELIEVER TRUST BUT VERIFY NOW WHAT WE HAVE VERIFIED IS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED BACKUP POWER IN THE OTHER REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SHOULD THIS BILL FROM LAST YEAR WE ORIGINALLY SENT RAZOR I ORIGINALLY WERE LOOKING AT. YEAH YEAH WE FROM INDUSTRY IS IT'S ABOUT A NETWORK THE NET RELIABLE. SO RIGHT NOW EIGHTEEN T. IS BRINGING IN ONE THOUSAND GENERATORS TO BE ABLE TO ATTACHED TO SPECIFIC IN STRATEGIC CELL TOWERS ACROSS THEIR TERRITORY TO GO TO KEEP THEIR NETWORK AND A MINIMUM LEVEL OF A RUNNING. NINE ONE ONE. EMERGENCY CELL IN TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME MINIMAL- INTERNET TO BE ABLE TO CLICK ON THE LINK TO BE ABLE TO GET TO YOUR OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES TEXT ALERTS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT INDUSTRIES ALREADY MOVING FOR WITH AS WELL AND WE WOULD BE HONORED TO BE A TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIM TO WORK WITH YOU TO VERY. I'M STILL. SO WHAT THAT I'VE EXPRESSED YOU KNOW I DO THINK WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT LEVEL OF SERVICE GET OUT OF A BACK POWER GENERATION MICROMANAGING WHERE THEY PUT STUFF CORRECT- I DO NEED THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT WHEN IT'S NOT POSSIBLE AND NOT MAKING THEM ON THE HOPE FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY DO- AND SO I THINK YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH SO I'M I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A COURTESY I TODAY AND THE FOR THOSE MEMBERS OF THE COME TO THE FORE. WE CONTINUE THE- WE'VE BEEN HAVING. NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH. CABLE LAN LINE AS WELL AS- SO PROVIDERS AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT IT'S THE RIGHT TING TO DO. AND WE NEED TO BE A TO GET THIS RIGHT FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU NEXT I HAVE A MISTER PATTERSON FOLLOWED BY MISS KAMLAGER FOLLOWED BY MR LOW. YEAH THANK YOU BOB. WELL FIRST OF ALL. I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT- I WANT TO MAKE THAT. CLEAR NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER TWO I ALSO THINK THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE TOO- LESS OF I THINK A WILLINGNESS TO REALLY ENGAGE WITH THE OPPOSITION I KNOW YOU SAID THE END OF THE TABLE I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS A LONG TIME. BUT THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE HOLES IN THIS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD OTHER. MEMBERS COMMENT ABOUT HERE THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT THE BEST OF INTENTIONS IN THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. ACTUALLY CAN AND I'VE BEEN HERE SIX YEARS CAM- DEVELOP UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND I THINK THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE PROVIDERS IN THOSE AFFECTED BY THIS THAT NUMBER ONE THEY ARE PERFECTLY WILLING AND ARE PRESENTLY DOING WHAT THEY CAN. TO GET ALL OF THIS BACK UP DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT ACTUALLY CREATES THE KINDS OF OUTCOMES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEIR CONCERN HAS TO DO WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE OF. THE LIKELIHOOD. OUR THAT WHAT YOU ARE PRESCRIBING IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IN THE FIELD WILL ACTUALLY HELP AND SO I'M GOING TO BE A NO VOTE NOW YOU MENTIONED A VERIFIED THEN TRUST. TRUST BUT VERIFY. I'M GOING TO VERIFY VERIFY THEN TRUST YOU HAVE SAID YOU WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT IS CORRECT ABOUT OPPOSITION WORK WILL CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD THIS IS THAT CORRECT- YEAH I MEAN WE YES WE WE'VE MET WITH THEM I MEAN A DOZEN TIMES MAYBE MORE STASSEN IT WITH THEM. HI I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR COMMITMENT IS NOT MERELY TO SIMPLY. GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS BUT TO ACTUALLY TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR. I WANT TO. REITERATE I THINK SOME OF THE CONCERNS HERE WITH RESPECT TO THE WAIVERS BUT ALSO ONE IN A IN A IN A MUCH BROADER SENSE THE PC HAS A NEW PRESIDENT PRESIDENT BADGER. I HAPPEN TO BE A FAN OF HERS I AM VICE CHAIR OF UTILITY AND ENERGY AND THAT COMES AS MAYBE SOME SURPRISE YOU SEE HAS BEEN DIFFICULT IN TIMES PAST. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE PC HAS HAS MADE. ARE A VERY CLEAR AND IN. MY JUDGMENT A COMPREHENSIVE. RULING ON THIS AND- I'M AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT RULING. AND THE- EXPECTATIONS OF IT FROM THE REGULATORY AGENCY. OUR IS NOT SATISFACTORY WHY THE OTHER LAYER OF A P. YOU SEE INVOLVEMENT IN A IN A IN A WAY FOR WHY A PRO SCRIPT GIVE EFFORT TO BASICALLY SAY YOU'RE GONNA DO YOU GOT TO DO ALL OF THESE BACK UPS. WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET. TO THEM WHETHER THEY'RE SAFE OR WHETHER THEY EVEN WORK. AM I CAN IS THAT THE EFFORT TO DO THAT TECHNOLOGY IN THIS BILL. MATT IS A HUGE ALLY IN THIS. THE VERY ONES WHO HAVE TO DO IT. SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR CONCERNS AND ALSO TO RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WHEN THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE TASKED WITH THIS. HEY AT THAT OF THERE'S NO REASON FOR THE BILL. UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THEIR COMMITMENT IS ONGOING RIGHT NOW TO GET THIS DONE WHAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THE BILL ACTUALLY GETS IN THE WAY OF A CLEAR AND A DIRECT THE DEVELOPMENT. OF THE KIND OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE BACK UPS. WE LIKE TO THINK THAT WE CAN WAIVE SOME KIND OF A MAGIC WAND AND PUT IT DOWN ON A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE REALITY IS THAT LEGISLATION HAS TO COMPORT WITH PHYSICS. AND HAS TO COMPORT WITH GEOGRAPHY AND HASTERT COMPORT WITH SAFETY AND WHAT CAN BE DONE. HI I'M GOING TO BE A NO VOTE I WISH THAT. I COULD COME TO THE FLOOR WHEN IT. AND IF IT GETS THERE. OUGHT TO BE AN AYE VOTE BUT IN ORDER FOR. ME TO BE COMFORTABLE I THINK OTHERS. I'M ASKING THAT YOU PAY ATTENTION IN IT AGAIN- AND- GO BACK TO THOSE WHO HAVE TO DO THIS- AND RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE- TRYING VERY VERY HARD TO. ACHIEVE IT- AND THEY WANT TO HELP AND I WANT TO GET IT DONE. BUT THEIR CONCERNS ARE REAL. AND NEED TO BE ADDRESSED NOT FOR THE SAKE OF. THE POLITICS OF THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE REALITY. OF ACTUALLY DOING IT APPRECIATE THAT AT THE TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH. RESEARCH HERE WITH A VERY TO RESPOND. YEAH SURE BUT- JUST. KNOWING THAT IT'S TWELVE FORTY FIVE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE SESSION IN HERE ONE GO AHEAD GOT IT I'LL BE VERY QUICK- I TOO USED TO BELIEVE THAT. INDUSTRY WAS GOING TO. DO THIS AND MAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS BY THEMSELVES. IN IN. THERE IN OUR OFFICE LAST YEAR SAYING WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE. WE ALREADY HAVE A- THERE'S ENOUGH GENERATORS IN STATE. AND THEN WE HAD TWO MILLION FOLKS LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO USE THEIR CELLPHONE OR LANDLINE INDOOR THEIR CABLE PHONE. THEY HAD TO BRING IN OVER TWO HUNDRED GENERATORS FROM ARIZONA TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR NETWORK RUNNING AFTER THEIR NETWORK HAD. GONE BLACK UP WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUES OF LISTENING TO THE INDUSTRY I'D LIKE TO BETTER TALK ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE TAKEN NUMBER ONE WE HAVE GONE FROM A TOWER BY TOWER. TO A BASIC LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT WAS LISTENING TO INDUSTRY NUMBER TWO ONE THE ISSUE OF A BACKUP AT POWER REQUIREMENTS COMPLETE FLEXIBILITY INDUSTRY ON HOW THEY MAINTAIN THEIR NETWORKS THEY TELL THE DO YOU SEE THE STATE ON WHICH TOWERS ARE CRITICAL TO BE TO KEEP THEIR NETWORKS UP AND RUNNING. AND THEN THEY ARE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE GENERATOR INTO THAT SPECIFIC SITE I THE ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO- LIABILITY PROTECTIONS JUST BEING VERY CANDID THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO AGREE UPON IT IS NOT BEEN IN ANY OTHER BILL SIMILAR TO THIS. AND THEN FINALLY AND I KNOW THEY'RE RUNNING A TIME IN REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF PERMITS THIS BILL ALLOWS THIS IF YOU SEE THE BABY OR DELAYED THERE BECAUSE- SHOULD THERE BE HENDRIX LET PERMITS. ONE AROUND FOLKS WILL BE RE MY US IN THE QUIRK ALL HAS A PERMIT X. THE IS MOVING FORWARD PASSAGE HERE HOUSE IT'S JUST PASS AT A GOVERNMENT'S FIND IN THE SENATE WITH BY. OR THAT'S GONNA THEM IS. AND OVER TIME. AT THE AUTHOR I'M JUST GONNA THIS UP ON THE SIDE OF COULD TO I I'VE BEEN TOLD I HAVE WE HAVE TO AND IT'S OF THE GO TO SESSION NO REASON PLEASE WITH KAMLAGER FOLLOW MY MISSED LOW AND I THE AUTHOR THE LITTLE SORT. GREAT AND I WILL MAKE THAT. THANK YOU. FOR YES. AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WITH OUR- I HAVE TO REQUEST. SO AS A RELATES TO THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACK. MOST CELL TOWERS ALREADY HAVE SOME KIND OF EITHER A BACKUP GENERATOR OR BATTERIES AND SO IS THIS- REQUIREMENT ON TOP OF THAT IN WINDOWS THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR. BACKUP PERIOD START DOES IT START AFTER THE UTILITY OF SHUT OFF OR DOES IT START AFTER THE CELL TOWER HAS BECOME AN OPERATIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO THERE- THERE ARE A LOT OF CELL TOWERS SAID HAVE ANYWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TWELVE HOUR- GENERATOR SOME HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR GENERATORS IT DEPENDS ON THE SITE. TWO FOR. TWO REASONS NUMBER ONE THE SIZE IN HOW MUCH SIZE YOU CAN THERE IS HOW ROOM IS AROUND CELL TOWER. NUMBER ONE IN THE NO TWO SUMMER OLDER SOME ARE NEWER AND SOME OF THE NEWER HAVE LONGER GENERATORS- AS FAR AS TIME WHEN IT THIS WOULD KICKING AT TIME OF THE POWER SHUT OFF. SEVENTY TWO HOURS BUT- THAT THIS IS THIS BILL WILL MEAN LARGER GENERATORS WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE BROUGHT IN. TO THAT MOST OF THE SITES AGAIN EIGHTEEN T. I'M AMUSING ROUGH NUMBERS THEY'RE ALREADY BRINGING IN- I THOUSAND LARGE GENERATORS FOR CRITICAL CELL SITES WITH IN THEIR IN THEIR TERRITORY TO BE A TO KEEP. A MINIMUM LEVEL OF THE NETWORK RUNNING ALREADY- AND NOW THIS WOULD BE REQUIREMENTS BUT THROUGHOUT I DON'T KNOW IT SOME. CENTER ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT. SO THEN THE SECOND QUICK CONCERNS THAT CP. IS STILL CONSIDERING WIRELESS RESILIENCY RULES AND HAS I THINK JUST ASK FOR SOME COMMENTS- SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS LEGISLATION IS OUT OF SYNC WITH THOSE PURPLE SEVENTY COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THE C. P. C. ON THIS BILL AS WELL- AND BELIEVE IT THIS GOT. UPON ENTRY. THANK YOU ONE RIGHT REMIND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT RUSHING THIS BOOK FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN SESSION IS STARTING SO I REALLY APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT. MR LOW. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF AN ADJUSTER GIVE THE VERY BRIEF BUT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE AUTHORS ASSEMBLY HAD LEGISLATION WITH RESPECT TO. A NOTIFICATION SO THEY SAY A C. SIGNIFICANT PARITY ON THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT BUT MY QUESTION WAS WITH RESPECT OR COMMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE WIRELINE. RESILIENCY PROCESS AND THAT IS C. P. YOU SEE I DO HAVE RESERVATIONS SIMILAR TO. I'VE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT FOR THE CPC SO I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME INCONSISTENCY WITHOUT OF WHATEVER THE REX MIGHT COME ABOUT WITHOUT OF LEGISLATION BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN JUST ADDRESS THAT YOU'RE CLOSE.

IN THAT REGARD BUT I DO APPLAUD THE SENATORS EFFORT TO TRY TO BE- AGGRESSIVE IN PROACTIVE AROUND AN ISSUE THAT HAS CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF CONSTERNATION.
