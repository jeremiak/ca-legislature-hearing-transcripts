00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:15.966
I TRUST IS 1100% EMPLOYER

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:17.968
FUNDED AND I UNDERSTAND THE

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:20.671
AUTHORS- WILLINGNESS AND HER

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.172
DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

00:42:26.543 --> 00:42:27.945
BENEFITS BUT I THINK THIS BILL

00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:29.580
GOES DOWN A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:31.615
AND THE REASON WHY IS. IF YOU

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:33.884
ARE A CONTRACTOR IN YOU-

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:35.853
CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER COMPANY

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.621
OR ANOTHER ORGANIZATION A TRUCK

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:39.056
DRIVING ORGANIZATION OR A TRUCK

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:41.025
DRIVER AND THAT PERSON OR THAT

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:43.594
ENTITY HIRES FIVE OTHER DRIVERS

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:45.663
YOU ARE NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE

00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:47.364
ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR YOU ARE AN

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:52.803
EMPLOYEE OF THE TRUCK DRIVER.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:53.404
WHO SECURED THOSE SERVICES. SO

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.406
TIM THE ARRAY CON REECE. FOR

00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:58.542
ALL OF THOSE EDT PAYMENTS WHEN-

00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:00.978
IN THIS SITUATION WOULD. MAKE

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:02.079
MAJOR CONTRACTORS OR

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:03.180
CONTRACTORS THAT SUPPLY TO

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.282
SUBCONTRACTORS- IT WOULD SET

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:06.617
PRECEDENCE FOR THEM SO THINK

00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:08.018
ABOUT THAT CALIFORNIA BUILDINGS

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:11.255
AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES. IF YOU

00:43:11.322 --> 00:43:11.755
HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:13.958
BUILDING A- A LARGE SHOPPING

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.926
CENTER AND THEY HIRE FIFTY

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:17.194
SIXTY SUBCONTRACTORS THAT DO

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.629
FRAMING ELECTRICAL OR ANYTHING

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.831
LIKE THAT. THIS BILL WOULD SET

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:22.333
PRECEDENCE THAT THE MEAT THE

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:23.734
PRIME CONTRACTOR WOULD BE

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.369
SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE EDT

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:28.405
PAYMENTS- AND ON THERE. EDT

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:30.207
ROLES WHEN THE BOTTOM LINE IS

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:31.642
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:33.344
THOSE EMPLOYEES RECORDS. LIKE I

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.611
SAID I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:35.779
AUTHOR IS GOING TRYING TO MAKE

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:37.448
SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS GET.

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:39.016
THESE BENEFITS THAT DESERVE

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:40.451
THESE BENEFITS BUT TO HAVE

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:41.852
SOMEBODY RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE

00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:43.654
BENEFITS THAT HAD NO CUSTODY

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.055
CARE CONTROL OVER HIRING THOSE

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:47.491
AND EMPLOYEES. THAT BELONG TO

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:48.425
ANOTHER COMPANY OR ANOTHER

00:43:48.492 --> 00:43:50.461
PERSON. IS JUST NOT THE RIGHT

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:53.263
SOLUTION WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.198
THERE'S ESTIMATED THIRTY

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:56.000
BILLION DOLLARS IN UNEMPLOYMENT

00:43:56.066 --> 00:43:58.002
AND YOU I TRUST FUND OVER DRAFT

00:43:58.068 --> 00:43:59.036
WHICH IS GOING TO FALL ON THE

00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:00.104
BACKS OF EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.139
OF CALIFORNIA. OVER THE NEXT

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:03.841
YEAR SO THINK ABOUT THAT AS

00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:06.110
WELL- A LOT OF IT BEING

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:06.710
FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS THAT WERE

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:08.812
PAID OUT. BUSINESSES ARE GOING

00:44:08.879 --> 00:44:09.646
TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR PAYING

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:11.015
THAT BECAUSE THE U. I TRUST

00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:13.784
FUND IS 1100% EMPLOYER FUNDED.

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:16.520
AND SO I AGAIN I AGREE WITH YOU

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:17.621
WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.156
TO MAKE SURE THOSE THAT DESERVE

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:21.091
BENEFITS. AND GET THOSE

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:22.459
BENEFITS BUT I THINK WE'RE

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:23.560
GOING AFTER THE WRONG

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:24.862

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:34.404
OCCURRING- BECAUSE FOR EVERY
