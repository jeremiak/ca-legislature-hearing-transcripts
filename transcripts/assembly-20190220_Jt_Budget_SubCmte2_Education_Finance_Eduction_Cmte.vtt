THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE ON OUR OWN

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:13.958

THAT'S BEING DISTRIBUTED TO YOU --

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:32.737
SO FIRST I'LL BRIEFLY DISCUSS --

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:34.172
THE STATE'S CHILD CARE AND

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.773
PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS GENERALLY OF

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.610
PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOR THREE

00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:41.112
AND FOUR YEAR OLDS.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.880
SO THE STATE ADMINISTERS SEVERAL

00:34:42.947 --> 00:34:43.648
CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL

00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:45.116
PROGRAMS FOR PRESCHOOL AGE

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:47.618
CHILDREN THE FIGURE ON PAGE ONE

00:34:47.685 --> 00:34:49.420
SHOWS THE PROGRAMS AND KEY

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:51.055
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.

00:34:51.122 --> 00:34:52.323
FROM THIS FIGURE YOU CAN SEE

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.258
THAT THE TOP TWO PROGRAMS LISTED

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:56.727
ARE MORE GENERALLY FOR CHILDREN

00:34:56.794 --> 00:34:58.930
UNDER THE AGE.

00:34:58.996 --> 00:34:59.664
THIRTEEN WELL THE BOTTOM TWO

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:00.965
PROGRAMS LISTED ARE FOR

00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:02.433
PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN CHILDREN

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.770
AGES THREE AND OR FOUR YEARS OLD.

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.338
THE STATE SPEND ROUGHLY FOUR

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:08.906
POINT SEVEN BILLION

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:11.876
ADMINISTERING THESE PROGRAMS.

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.811
ON PAGE TWO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.880
STATE SERVES ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.748
AND SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN.

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:19.417
THE STATE --

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.985
FOR IT A SEVENTY THOUSAND

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:22.487
CHILDREN IN THESE PROGRAMS AND

00:35:22.553 --> 00:35:23.921
THIS FIGURE SHOWS HOW SLAUGHTER

00:35:23.988 --> 00:35:26.991
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS EACH PROGRAM.

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:28.359
SO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF

00:35:28.426 --> 00:35:30.228
THE SLOTS ARE FOR PROGRAMS THAT

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:31.963
SPECIFICALLY SIR PRESCHOOL AGE

00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:33.097
SHOW OF PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:34.832
AND THAT'S THE STATE PRESCHOOL

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:35.333
PROGRAM AND TRANSITIONAL

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:38.369
KINDERGARTEN.

00:35:38.436 --> 00:35:39.537
SO ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:41.839
OUT SHOWS THE TABLE COMPARING

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:44.175
STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS SERVING

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.510
PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN MORE

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:46.644
SPECIFICALLY.

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:48.312
AND THIS TABLE ALSO INCLUDES

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:50.047
HEAD START A FEDERALLY FUNDED

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:51.482
PROGRAM.

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:53.150
THIS TABLES PRIMARILY FOR YOUR

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:55.052
RESOURCE BUT I DID WANT TO POINT

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.654
OUT A FEW THINGS.

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:58.289
SO STATE PRESCHOOL --

00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:00.057
THE CONTRACTOR VOUCHER PROGRAMS

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:01.826
AND THE HEAD START PROGRAM ALL

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.194
HAVE INCOME ELIGIBILITY

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:04.629
REQUIREMENTS --

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:05.263
TO FAMILIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:08.299
THESE PER LEARN WILL HAVE TO

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:09.500
EARN LESS THAN A SPECIFIED

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:13.905
INCOME AMOUNT FOR THEIR FAMILIES --

00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.106
AND SO THE STATE PROGRAMS ALLOW

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:16.774
FAMILIES TO HAVE HIGHER INCOMES

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.009
COMPARED TO HEAD START AND YOU

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:20.011
COULD SEE THE INCOME.

00:36:20.077 --> 00:36:21.879
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS HERE.

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.014
THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.482
PROGRAM IS A PROGRAM THAT

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:25.516
DOESN'T HAVE AN INCOME

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:27.118
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.

00:36:27.184 --> 00:36:28.452
THE OTHER THINGS I WILL POINT

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:30.254
OUT IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS CAN

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:31.956
VARY SIGNIFICANTLY PROGRAMMATIC

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.257
LEASE TO FOR EXAMPLE STATE

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:34.859
PRESCHOOL COULD OFFER A THREE

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.527
HOUR PROGRAM OR A TEN HOUR

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:37.695
PROGRAM --

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:40.197
DAILY PROGRAM FOR A CHILD --

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:41.832
A CHILD COULD ALSO RECEIVING THE

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:43.134
STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.403
SOMETHING THAT ALIGNS A HUNDRED

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:46.237
SOMETHING THAT ALIGNS WITH

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:47.071
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH WOULD BE

00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:48.406
A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OUT OF THE

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:50.174
YEAR OR SOMETHING THAT'S YEAR

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.742
ROUND THAT COULD WE OFFER

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.644
PROGRAMS FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:55.479
DAYS A YEAR.

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.848
AND TURNING TO PAGE FOUR ON THE

00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:59.417
CHART ON PAGE FOUR SHOWS THAT

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:01.185
MORE THAN HALF OF LOW INCOME

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:02.620
FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE SERVED IN A

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:04.422
STATE FUNDED PROGRAM.

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:06.557
SO WE ESTIMATE THE STATE US THE

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:08.259
STATE HAS ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:09.961
AND TEN THOUSAND LOW INCOME FOUR

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.896
YEAR OLDS. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:13.264
CHART WERE DEFINING LOW INCOME

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:15.366
FOUR YEAR OLDS.

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:17.034
AS THE FOUR YEAR OLD IN A FAMILY

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:18.336
THAT HAS AN INCOME AT OR BELOW

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:20.805
THE 85% OF THE STATE MEDIAN

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.306
INCOME.

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:22.974
AND THIS IS THE INCOME

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.775
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STATE

00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:27.278
PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE PROGRAMS

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:28.779
EFFECTIVE JULY.

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:29.580
TWENTY NINETEEN NOW I MENTION

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:32.817
THIS BECAUSE USING THE TWENTY

00:37:32.883 --> 00:37:33.284
NINETEEN TWENTY INCOME

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:34.652
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA INSTEAD OF

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.554
THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN INCOME

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:37.989
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.

00:37:38.055 --> 00:37:40.124
AS AN ESTIMATED FIFTY THOUSAND

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:41.258
ELIGIBLE FOUR YEAR OLDS.

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:42.560
SO WE WERE TO DEVELOP THIS

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:44.862
FIGURE USING TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.330
NINETEEN ELIGIBILITY THIS FIGURE

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:48.599
WOULD LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:49.867
SO FROM THIS TO FIGURE STATE

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.936
PRESCHOOL SERVES THE LARGER

00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:53.571
SHARE OF THE POPULATION.

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:54.705
FOLLOWED BY TRANSITIONAL

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:56.741
KINDERGARTEN AND FOLLOWED BY

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:48.793
DULY ENROLLED IN HEAD START IN

STATE PRESCHOOL.

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:51.929
STILL WE WERE TO USE THE DATA

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:53.798
THAT HEAD START REPORTS --

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:54.398
THEY SERVE IN THIS FIGURE THAT

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:56.967
WOULD OVER --

00:38:57.034 --> 00:38:58.069
THE CHILDREN SERVED.

00:38:58.135 --> 00:38:59.170
UP AND THAT CONCLUDES MY

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:00.805
PREPARED REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:02.339
TO TAKE QUESTIONS OKAY.

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:03.607
THANK YOU.

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:05.276
I THINK I'LL START WITH WITH THE

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:06.644
KEY QUESTION KIND OF WHERE WE

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:09.447
HEAR TODAY IS WE THINK THERE ARE.

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.449
THOUSANDS IF NOT TENS OF

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:14.051
THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME FOUR

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:15.753
YEAR OLDS WHO ARE NOT SERVICE.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.121
AND SO I KNOW THAT --

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:19.156
THAT -- NEAR

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:21.692
AND OTHERS HAVE PUT OUT SOME

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.461
NUMBERS AS FAR AS HOW MANY.

00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:24.795
LOW INCOME THREE AND FOUR YEAR

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:27.765
OLDS ARE UNSERVED AND YOU KNOW.

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:29.600
THAT THE YOU KNOW THOSE NUMBERS

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:30.434
I'M SURE OF COURSE --

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:31.435
IF YOU COULD ELUDE TO THAT

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:32.503
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN YOUR

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.038
CHART YOU SAY WE DON'T NOW BUT

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:35.706
MAYBE YOU COULD TALK WHAT.

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.408
OTHERS ARE SAYING AS FAR AS HOW

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:39.343
MANY AYE AYE WE'VE HEARD BETWEEN

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.011
THIRTY AND FIFTY THOUSAND OVER

00:39:41.078 --> 00:39:43.080
THE LAST FEW YEARS OF LOW INCOME

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.415
FOUR YEAR OLDS AT ARTS IN EITHER

00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:45.649
TKA.

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:48.619
STATE PRESCHOOL OR OR HEAD START

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.454
AND WONDER IF YOU COULD

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.123
ENLIGHTEN US A BIT MORE ON THAT.

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:55.426
YES A SOME SO SOME OF THE I'VE

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:56.761
SEEN -- HAVE

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:59.430
BEEN MORE GENERALLY.

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:01.599
FOR LOOKING AT ELIGIBLE FISH --

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:03.000
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES UNDER THE

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.001
AGE OF THIRTEEN SO I'VE SEEN

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:04.668
FIGURES --

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:05.870
RELATED TO THAT I'VE SEEN SOME

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:07.805
SPECIFIC --

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:09.740
BETWEEN AGES. THREE SCHOOL AGE

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:10.608
CHILDREN --

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:12.777
THOSE OF PARTICULAR FIGURES

00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:14.745
WOULD MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT --

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:17.281
DUAL ENROLLMENT THAT --

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:18.649
WE DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE MAKING

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.417
FUN BUT IT'S AN H. IT WOULD JUST

00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:22.353
DEPEND --

00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:26.257
BUT MY DOES THAT WORK ABOUT THE

00:40:26.323 --> 00:40:26.891
WITH THE LEAD FINANCE OFFICE I

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:28.325
THINK RIGHT THEIR NUMBER NUMBER

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:28.859
OF DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:29.627
NUMBERS THAT ARE OUT THERE I

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:30.294
THINK.

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:32.163
AND ALL AND WE HAVE ALSO CHANGED

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:33.531
THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:34.265
REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAST FEW

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:35.566
YEARS SO --

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:37.334
THESE THESE DIFFERENT NUMBERS

00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:38.369
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:39.370
LAST SEVERAL YEARS ALL OF THEM

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:41.338
WILL BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT --

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.140
AND AND SO I THINK THAT THAT

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.842
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN --

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:46.377
SEND THE DIFFICULT INTERNET PAID

00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:47.711
TO A SPECIFIC NUMBER BUT EITHER

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:48.379
WAY WITH ANY OF THE NUMBERS THAT

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:53.784
YOU HAVE YOUR WERE TALKING ABOUT --

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:54.451
AND THE OF MANY TENS OF

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:56.687
THOUSANDS OF ELIGIBLE FOR FOUR

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:57.321
YEAR OLDS THAT ARE THAT THERE

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:58.656
WOULD NOT BE THAT ARE NOT BEING

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:00.491
SERVE RIGHT NOW SO REGARDLESS OF

00:41:00.558 --> 00:41:01.091
WHICH NUMBER YOU TAKE I THINK

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:01.792
THEY'RE STILL.

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:03.594
A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF

00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:05.329
CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE IN

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.697
THAT ARE FOUR YEARS OLD THAT

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.365
THAT THAT ARE NOT BEING SERVED

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:09.867
AND THEN I'M NOT WHAT THEY ALSO --

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:11.535
THE FOUR YEAR OLD OF ALL OUR

00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:13.337
AGES FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE PROBABLY

00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:14.972
THE HIGHEST SERVE THE BALL SO WE

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:15.873
DID THE THING CHART FOR THREE

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.007
YEAR OLDS WE DON'T HAVE

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:17.608
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WE

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:18.876
HAVEN'T MUCH.

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:19.910
SMALLER PROPORTION OF THEM BEING

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.312
SERVED IN THE PRESCHOOL YOU

00:41:21.378 --> 00:41:22.513
WOULD HAVE A VERY SMALL

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.382
PERCENTAGE OF THEM --

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:28.319
THAT ARE BEING SERVED SO.

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:28.986
THIS IS CHAU THERE'S AN

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:30.154
OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPENDING

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:32.122
SERVICES TO THE THE CHILDREN

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:34.091
THAT WE THINK ARE THE HIGHEST ME

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:34.725
WHICH OF CHILDREN WHO ARE OR LOW

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:36.727
INCOME.

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:38.028
AND THEN A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IN

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:40.297
THE LAST FEW YEARS SINCE THE

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:42.399
LAST FIVE YEARS WE I THINK HAD --

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:44.235
DIRECTING ITS LAST SIX YEARS FOR

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:46.136
MAJOR BUDGET INCREASES TO

00:41:46.203 --> 00:41:47.471
INCREASE LOTS.

00:41:47.538 --> 00:41:50.274
AND TO MAKE SUCCESS MAINLY

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.876
POSITIVE SUCCESS BUT IN THE LAST

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:53.043
COUPLE.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:54.645
ITERATIONS OF BUDGET ACTIONS

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.080
WITH INCREASE LOTS IN THE

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:56.981
CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL

00:41:57.047 --> 00:41:58.883
PROGRAM NOT THAT THE OTHER JUST

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.684
THIS SPECIFICALLY.

00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:02.720
THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS ON

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:04.355
THE MONEY'S COMING BACK IN AND

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:06.523
WONDER IF THE LA --

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.892
HAS ANY THOUGHTS --

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:10.027
IDEAS ON WHY THAT IS OR WHAT WE

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:11.428
COULD BE DOING DIFFERENTLY WITH

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:14.431
WITH RELATION TO FACILITIES --

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:17.501
REIMBURSEMENT RATES WORKFORCE

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:18.235
NEEDS.

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:19.737
SO.

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:20.304
FOR THE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:23.307
YEARS THE THE WHERE THERE WERE.

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:25.476
I THINK A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN

00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:26.110
THREE THOUSAND SLOTS THAT WERE

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:27.945
APPROVED OVER A THREE YEAR

00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:29.647
PERIOD THEY ALL WENT TO THEY

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.649
WERE AWFUL DAY SLOTS THAT WENT

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.017
TO EL THE ACE TO SCHOOL

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:33.784
DISTRICTS ARE COUNTY UP.

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:34.985
EDUCATION ABOUT BECAUSE THE

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:36.587
FUNDING WAS LIMITED TO

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:37.688
PROPOSITION NINETY FUNDING.

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:39.823
I'M SO WE WE HAVE HEARD OVER THE

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:40.758
LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT THERE'S

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:41.992
BEEN SOME DIFFICULTY IN GETTING

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:43.627
THOSE SLOTS USED A LOT ABOUT

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.462
FUNDING HAVE COME BACK --

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:46.664
HAS AND IT'S BEEN IN USE THAT IN

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.499
SOME CASES THE DEPARTMENT HAS

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:50.601
TAKEN THAT INSTEAD OF ENDING

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:52.803
INSTEAD READ DURING OUR A NEW

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.271
REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS AND

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:55.439
ISSUING THAT --

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:57.308
THOSE SLOTS AT THE SLOTS FOR

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:59.076
ELEAZAR AND SOMETIMES ALSO NON

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:00.577
NON ELLIE IS AS WELL --

00:43:00.644 --> 00:43:01.545
SO WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:02.947
THIS CONCERNING THINK WE'VE BEEN

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:03.981
TRYING TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF

00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:05.449
WHAT'S GOING ON AND IT'S IT'S

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:07.651
HARD TO KNOW THE EXACT REASON.

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.553
ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT --

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.854
DISTRICTS FOR IF IN OUR

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.523
DISCUSSION WITH --

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:13.657
FOLKS IN THE FIELD DISTRICTS

00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.559
SEEM TO BE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:16.794
WANT TO OFFER FULL DAY PROGRAM

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.462
THEY PREFER OFFER THE PARTY

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:20.097
SCHOOL YOUR PROGRAM SO BY.

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:21.665
YOUR MARKING IT TO ELEAZAR MIGHT

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:23.400
HAVE LIMITED THAT THE SORT OF

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:24.835
TAKE UP OF THE SLOTS --

00:43:24.902 --> 00:43:26.737
NOT LEDS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:27.738
OFFER FULL DAY PROGRAMS IN MAY

00:43:27.805 --> 00:43:29.206
AND SO --

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.607
PERHAPS DISTRIBUTING IT TO NOT

00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:32.476
ALWAYS MIGHT INCREASE THE AMOUNT

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:33.777
THAT THAT WE WITH THE TAKEN UP.

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:38.849
DISTRICTS ARE DEALING WITH THEIR

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:42.953
OWN FACILITIES ARE BEFORE WHO'VE

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.554
BEEN --

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.189
THEY'VE BEEN USING SOME OF THEIR

00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:47.091
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS TO

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:48.759
DO MORE TO QUE OUR EXPANDED TO

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:50.427
GET A WE MIGHT NOT HAVE SPACE

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.528
FOR SOME OF THESE ARE.

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:52.997
OF ADDITIONAL DAY PRESCHOOLS

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:54.732
LOTS.

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.000
OKAY THANK YOU.

ACTUALLY WERE ALSO STATE LONG

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:52.156
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN WORKING ON

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:54.091
THIS ISSUE AND HOW MANY.

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.826
HOW HOW MUCH?

00:44:55.893 --> 00:44:57.127
BROWN HAS ALREADY BEEN CELLS BUT

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:59.296

INSTITUTE FOR EARLY EDUCATION

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:07.905
RESEARCH --

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:10.874
WE'RE AT AN INSTITUTE OF RECORDS

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:13.143
UNIVERSITY AND CONDUCT RESEARCH

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.345
TO INFORM PUBLIC POLICY AROUND

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:16.680
MOST ON EARLY EDUCATION

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:19.817
GENERALLY BUT CPAS MOST

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:20.684
SPECIFICALLY AROUND PRESCHOOL

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:20.984
[inaudible]

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:25.589
AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:28.325
ARMED BUT THAT MOST KNOWN FOR IS

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:29.359
ARE YOUR BOOK WHICH SHALL BE.

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:30.327
ALLUDING TO A LITTLE BIT TODAY

00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:31.695
IN CHERRY SHOWING YOU SOME DATA

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.163
FROM THAT --

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.165
BUT FIRST I WANT TO IF YOU LOOK

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:36.533
AT THEM.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.601
SLIDE TO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:39.636
THE RESEARCH MORE GENERALLY

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:41.638
AROUND WHAT IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY

00:45:41.705 --> 00:45:43.173
HAVE A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.175
LEADS TO LASTING EFFECTS FOR

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:46.844
YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.913
AND I'M BORROWING AT A TERM FROM

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.449
ONE OF YOUR NATIVE DAUGHTERS

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:54.351
MARCY WHITE BURKE BUCK FROM

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.285
UNIVERSITY --

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:57.154
I'M FROM BERKELEY.

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:58.856
THE BUT I'VE BEEN NO SINGLE

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.591
INGREDIENT SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:46:00.657 --> 00:46:03.193
KNOW THAT WE CAN'T DO PRE K.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.428
WITH JUST.

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:06.029
GETTING ONE THING RIGHT.

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.564
THIRD UP A CONSTELLATION OF

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:10.033
FACTORS THAT HAVE TO BE IN PLACE

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.236
TO REALLY MOVE THE BAR IN TERMS

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:13.704
OF CHILDREN'S OUT COMES.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.074
THE AND WE HAVE SEARCH THAT

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:19.343
YOU'VE ALLUDED.

00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:20.777
TO ABOUT --

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:23.680
THE HOW ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:25.182
THE EFFECT OF PRESCHOOL BUT WE

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:26.550
ALSO HAVE.

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:28.285
THAT SAME BODY RESEARCH SHOWS US

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:29.953
HOW OFTEN WE GET IT WRONG.

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.522
AND SO I'M REALLY HOPEFUL THAT

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:32.189
WITH THIS MOVE YOU'RE GOING TO

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:33.590
GET IT RIGHT AND YOU'LL HAVE A

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:35.425
PROGRAM THAT THAT REALLY MAKES

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:36.727
THE DIFFERENCE AND SO.

00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:38.795
IT'S LIKE --

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.797
TO DESCRIBES.

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:41.765
SOME OF THESE.

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.433
ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS AND I'M

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.568
CALLING THEM THE CENTRAL ON

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:45.836
PURPOSE IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN'T

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:47.871
JUST TAKE ONE FROM COLUMN A AND

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.540
NOT TAKE ONE FROM COLUMN BAY.

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:51.542
THE FIRST THREE I THINK COULD

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:54.311
GENERALLY BE TO DESCRIBE THIS.

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:55.212
CRITICAL --

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:56.980
STRUCTURAL POLICY ELEMENTS THERE

00:46:57.047 --> 00:46:58.882
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE REQUIRED

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:01.251
AND PUT IN PLACE --

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:03.687
AT THE POLICY LEVEL AND FUNDED.

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:05.222
AND AND THEIR THE HARDEST THINGS

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:06.557
IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:08.692
THE ONES THAT CHEN THAT DO NEED

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:11.195
TO GENERATE MORE FUNDS --

00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:13.297
THE FIRST IS THE THAT TEACHERS

00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:15.933
NEED TO BE WELL EDUCATED AND AM.

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:18.302
FAIRLY COMPENSATED [inaudible]

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:21.838
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY ALSO

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:24.107
NEED TO HAVE EXPERT LEADERS SAY

00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:25.709
THE AGAIN IT'S IT'S NOT AN

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:27.311
EITHER OR IT'S A BOTH.

00:47:27.377 --> 00:47:29.646
THEY AN ADEQUATE DOSAGE WE'RE

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:31.014
NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT IT TAKES

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:33.383
BUT WE KNOW THAT TWO YEARS GETS

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:34.785
BETTER RESULTS THAN.

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:36.253
ONE AND WE KNOW THAT FULL DAY

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.988
GETS BETTER RESULTS THAN HALF.

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:39.356
TWO YEARS OF A MEDIOCRE PROGRAM

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:41.425
PROBABLY DOESN'T DOUBLE THE A

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:42.926
FAX --

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:43.794
YOU'VE YOU'VE WE ARE PRETTY IT'S

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.063
PRETTY MUCH AGAIN ALL THE

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:48.832
INGREDIENTS HAVE TO BE IN PLACE --

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:49.900
FOR SMALL CLASS SIZES WITH

00:47:49.967 --> 00:47:52.102
REASONABLE STAFF CHILD RATIOS

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:54.204
IT'S NOT THERE'S NOT A PERFECT

00:47:54.271 --> 00:47:55.205
ANSWER TO THAT.

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:57.174
I'LL BE SHOWING YOU SOME

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:59.476
DIFFERENT EXAMPLES BUT SO WHAT

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:01.144
THE OTHER FEATURES ARE IN THE

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:04.047
PROGRAM THAT WE KNOW THAT HAVING

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:05.282
NO CLASS SIZE LIMIT IS NOT A

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:06.583
GOOD CHOICE.

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:12.723
AND THE THEN THE OTHER THROUGH

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:14.491
THE NEXT THREE ITEMS HERE ARE

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:16.260
INGREDIENTS TO REALLY LOOK AT

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:18.295
THE PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS WHAT'S

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:19.997
HAPPENING IN THE SYSTEM.

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:22.165
AND AND AND AND THAT SUPPORT

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.400
TEACHERS TEACH WELL.

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:26.336
AND THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:28.305
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE MOST OF

00:48:28.372 --> 00:48:29.706
IN PLACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:31.508
GOOD LEARNING STANDARDS THAT ARE

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:32.976
COMPREHENSIVE --

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:34.444
THAT ARE.

00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:35.245
THE ONE THING YOU'RE KIND OF

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:36.780
MISSING IS ENSURING THAT YOUR

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:39.883
CURRICULUM IS DIRECTLY RELATED.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:42.119
TO THE STANDARDS AND DESIGNED.

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:43.553
TO ENSURE CHILDREN LEARN THEM.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.890
AND AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THAT

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:48.158
HELPS INFORM TEACHING.

00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:49.793
THAT'S RELATED TO THAT

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.428
CURRICULUM AND NOT JUST THE

00:48:51.495 --> 00:48:52.095
STANDARDS BUT TO THE CURRICULUM

00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:53.730
AS WELL AND THEN FINALLY

00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:55.465
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT.

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:57.567
THINK THAT AGAIN IS IS PART OF

00:48:57.634 --> 00:48:59.436
THIS FULLY INTEGRATED.

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:01.738
APPROACH --

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:02.906
RELATED TO THAT OF COURSE IS A

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:05.309
COHERENT --

00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:08.178
SYSTEM FOR REVIEW AND EFFORT FOR

00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:09.513
PEOPLE TO KNOW HOW WELL THEY'RE

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:10.947
DOING AND YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT

00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:12.883
AT AT AT AND THAT.

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:14.351
THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THAT.

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:17.220
THAT OR AT SOME KIND OF LARGER

00:49:17.287 --> 00:49:19.356
GOVERNING BODY LEVEL IT COULD BE

00:49:19.423 --> 00:49:22.492
REGIONAL OR EVEN DISTRICT --

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.294
RELATED TO CONTINUOUS DATA

00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:25.929
DRIVEN IMPROVEMENT SYSTEMS DATE

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:27.097
AT THE CHILD LEVEL AT THE

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.665
CLASSROOM LEVEL.

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:30.801
AT THE BUILDING LEVEL AT EVERY

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:32.002
LEVEL SO THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:33.036
AT HOW THEY'RE DOING AND

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:34.571
CORRECTING SHIP AS THEY'RE GOING

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:38.642
ALONG.

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:39.676
SO -- NOW

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:41.111
WILL TURN TO SOME DATA ABOUT

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:43.080
CALIFORNIA I KNOW THAT YOU WERE

00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:44.414
JUST TALKING ABOUT SOME NUMBERS

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:45.849
AND WE'RE GOING TO ARE GOING TO

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.217
CONTRADICT THE LA A LITTLE BIT

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:48.518
BUT IT'S JUST BECAUSE THE WAY WE

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:49.820
LOOK AT THINGS.

00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:50.854
WHEN WE DO THE STATE PRE K.

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.489
YEARBOOK WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:54.691
FIFTY STATES SEVEN OF WHICH HAVE

00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:55.992
NO PRE K. PROGRAM AND THEY GET A

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:58.061
PAGE IN OUR YOUR BOOK THAT SAYS

00:49:58.128 --> 00:49:59.563
NO PRESCHOOL PROGRAM?

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.798
IS THAT THE WALL OF SHAME OR THE

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:04.334
PAGE IF SHE TO CALL IN THE

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:07.404
WILDERNESS STATES BECAUSE MOST

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.306
OF OUR OUT IN THE NORTH WEST AND

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:09.506
HAVE.

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:14.511
THE WE LOOK AT THREE SORT OF

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:16.847
LEGS OF THE STOOL OF AT WILL --

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:19.316
AT THE STATE POLICY LEVEL SO ONE

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:21.718
IS FUNDING AND RESOURCES ONE IS

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:23.220
ACCESS AND HOW MANY CHILDREN --

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:25.055
ARNOLD.

00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:26.923
AND THEN THE THIRD IS QUALITY --

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.126
AND WE THINK ABOUT THE QUALITY

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:31.728
AS THE MINIMAL POLICY STANDARDS

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:32.662
THAT NEED TO BE IN PLACE IT'S

00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:33.363
REALLY IMPORTANT I SAY THAT

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:36.166
BECAUSE THESE DO NOT GUARANTEE.

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:37.934
YOU'LL GET LONGITUDINAL RESULTS

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.035
THIS IS THESE ARE JUST THE

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:41.471
MINIMAL POLICY STANDARDS SO HOW

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:42.973
DOES CALIFORNIA RANK WELL.

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:45.409
IF WE LOOK AT CAL ENROLLMENT IN

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:46.710
THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN IN

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:48.478
THIS IS WHERE OUR NUMBERS DIFFER

00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:51.648
A LITTLE BIT --

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:54.050
IF WE PUT THE CALIFORNIA.

RANK THIRTEENTH OUT OF THE FIFTY

00:51:01.992 --> 00:51:05.362
STATES BUT IF WE TAKE T. K. OUT --

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:08.398

ON THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEAR

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:27.384

RESOURCES.

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.563
SO YOU'RE AT YOUR RANK ABOUT OF

00:51:39.629 --> 00:51:43.033
FORT FOURTEENTH OR THIRTEENTH

DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:48.538
AT FOR FOR RESOURCES BUT AN

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:50.207
IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT IF

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:52.108
YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF SITE.

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:54.578
THREE THAT LITTLE ASTERIX.

00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:56.112
THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:57.180
PRESCHOOL SHOULD COSTS

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:59.850
DRAMATICALLY LESS.

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:02.285
BANGKIT TROUGH.

00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:04.387
AND YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:05.755
PREFERRED PK DOLLARS ARE

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:07.190
DRAMATICALLY LESS THAN TWELVE

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.225
DOLLARS SO THAT SOMETHING AND

00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:09.259
AND AND THEN THAT SHOWS IF YOU

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:13.263
LOOK ON SLIDE. FOR THAT SHOWS IN

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.599
YOUR QUALITY BENCHMARKS --

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:17.067
WE HAVE TEN SPECIFIC --

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:19.369
POLICIES THAT WE LOOK AT A

00:52:19.436 --> 00:52:22.506
CALIFORNIA STATE PRE K..

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:25.141
MEET SIX OF THOSE TEN AND THAT

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:26.443
THE FOR THAT YOU'RE MISSING

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.845
AGAIN ARE THE ONES THAT OFTEN

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:32.382
ARE THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONES

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:32.682
[inaudible]

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:37.754
THE SO THE CLASS SIZE OF TWINS

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:40.257
TO INTERPRET BECAUSE THAT EACH

00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:41.758
THAT'S BECAUSE OF TKA.

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.927
ARE BIG CLASS I'D LIKE THINK YOU

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:46.763
ALSO DON'T HAVE A SIZE LIMIT IN

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:47.898
YOUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN ALL

00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:49.599
YEAH WE HAVE THE RATIO BUT NOT

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:50.367
YEAH YOU HAVE THE RATIO BUT NOT

00:52:50.433 --> 00:52:51.601
THAT LHASA YES SO YOU GET ONE OF

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:51.801
THEM.

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.236
AND MY CONCERN WITH THE RATIO I

00:52:53.303 --> 00:52:54.604
WOULD JUST SAY IS.

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:55.505
A RATE RATIO --

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:57.207
IF IT'S JUST ADULTS TO CHILDREN

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.609
BUT GIVEN YOUR ASSISTANT TEACHER

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:03.146
QUALIFICATION RULES.

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:03.346
THAT.

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:05.348
AGAIN NOT.

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:06.249
MANY OF THOSE TEACHERS ARE GOING

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:07.918
TO BE EXCELLENT BUT MANY ARE NOT --

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:08.618
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:10.086
QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PAT YOU'RE

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:11.688
GOING TO BE HAVING A LOT OF TURN

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:15.191
OF ITS RESULT OF THAT --

00:53:15.258 --> 00:53:17.427
SO THE THAT ONE TO EIGHT RATIOS

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:18.328
GREAT AND MAYBE YOU COULD DO

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:20.196
THAT WOULD AND CLASS AS A TWENTY

00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:21.498
FOUR WE DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD DAY

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:22.933
TO SAY THAT YOU CAN DO THAT BUT

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:24.834
I THINK IT'S IT'S SOMETHING YOU

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:25.368
COULD.

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:28.305
ASK BET WHEN TO WHEN WHEN THAT

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:31.074

00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:33.810
WELL IN. FOR TWO THIRDS OF THE

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:35.712
CLASSROOM AS AN ADULT WITH THE

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.681
HIS USE A CONSIDERED IT AT AN

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:38.582
ASSISTANT TEACHER THEN YOU'RE.

00:53:38.648 --> 00:53:40.050
IT'S BEGINNING TO BE AN ISSUE I

00:53:40.116 --> 00:53:44.054
THINK IN TERMS OF THE THE THE

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.589
FACT THAT [inaudible]

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.424

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:03.873

WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO.

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:54.884

00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:19.909
VISION FOR OUR UNIVERSAL

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:56.919
THAT ARE IN GREEDY KEY

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:59.288
INGREDIENTS THAT I TALKED ABOUT

01:00:59.355 --> 01:00:59.522
EARLIER.

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:02.592
ON SLIDE --

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:04.761
TO FUNDING WAS WAS MANDATED FOR

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.262
ALL THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS.

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:09.232
AS IT WAS AT UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:10.066
THIRTY ONE LOW INCOME SCHOOL

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:10.933
DISTRICTS.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.903
SO WE DID AND THAT WITH OF WHAT.

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:17.106
PRESCHOOL POPULATION OF THOSE.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.208
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WAS WAS.

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:20.910
OVER SIXTY THOUSAND SO IT'S

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:22.412
NOTHING LIKE THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.113
SCALE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT --

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.648
NEW JERSEY IS DENSELY POPULATED

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.283
BUT TINY SO OUR OUR TOTAL

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.652
POPULATION IS IS IS SMALL

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:31.087
COMPARED TO YOURS --

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.889
THE FUNDING THAT WENT INTO THIS

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:35.324
PROGRAM FIRST WAS USED TO

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:36.859
IMPROVE PROGRAM STANDARDS.

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:38.995
AND THE KINDS OF THINGS I TALKED

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.163
ABOUT TEACHERS WITH BACHELOR'S

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:41.197
DEGREES PAID.

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:44.567
AT PARITY ON THE SAME CELL RISK

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:46.269
LIST OF WHERE THEY TAUGHT --

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:47.737
IT WAS A MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:49.172
AND THAT IN THE BEGINNING TWO

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.139
THIRDS OF THE CHILDREN WERE

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.607
SERVED AND PRIVATE PROVIDER

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.276
CLASSROOMS EITHER CHILD LICENSED

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.344
CHILDCARE CENTERS OR HEAD START

01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:56.512
PROGRAMS --

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:58.081
AND THEN THE OTHER THIRD IN

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.148
PUBLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOMS BUT

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:00.516
THERE WAS ADMINISTERED THROUGH

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:01.851
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:04.187
AND THAT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS A

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:06.522
PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM AND

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:08.891
IT'S A PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:12.261
THE THE QUALITY AND AS A RESULT

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:13.496
OF THAT FUNDING AND IMPROVE

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.764
STANDARDS AND THEN PLAYED

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:16.032
RESOURCES.

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:18.434
AND A LOT OF SUPPORT TO PROGRAMS

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:19.802
QUALITY IN THE CLASSROOMS

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.237
IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY OVER THE

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:24.474
FIRST. THREE YEARS AND THEN BY

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.075
BY THE TIME THE PROGRAM WAS

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:27.677
EIGHT YEARS OLD IT WAS IT WAS

01:02:27.743 --> 01:02:29.178
QUITE GOOD.

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.513
AND THAT YOU CAN SEE IN THE

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.783
SMALL SLIDE IN THIS INSIGHT IS.

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.685
INSERTED SLIGHT GOT GRAPH ON THE

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.453
LEFT HAND CORNER YOU'LL SEE HOW

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.522
AT THE CRAFT SKEWS TO THE RIGHT

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.657
AND THAT'S AS TIME GOES BY THAT.

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:43.559
THE PROGRAM IMPROVES AND REALLY

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:45.061
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:47.130
NO CLASSROOMS SCORED AND THE

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:49.098
AREA THAT WOULD BE CALLED CAN TO

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:50.399
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FOR

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:52.235
CHILDREN ARE HARMFUL TO CHILDREN.

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:54.604
AND VERY FEW SCORED BELOW THE

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.105
MIDLINE BY THE END OF THIS AT

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.907
THIS PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT IN THE

01:02:57.974 --> 01:02:59.175
RESOURCES GOING AND SO IT TOOK

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:00.676
ABOUT THREE SOURCES AND PROGRAM

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.311
IMPROVEMENTS --

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:03.546
INITIATIVES.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.648
WHAT HAPPENED AS A RESULT YOU'LL

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.183
SEE ON THE SLIDE AT THE?

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.185
RIGHT THAT GRAPH AT THE RIGHT

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:11.621
UPPER RIGHT HAND OF THE SLIDE --

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:13.356
FIVE FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADE WE

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:16.392
WERE DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THAT.

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.027
HAD THEIR MATIC EFFECTS ON

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:20.897
CHILDREN'S STATE TESTED --

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.532
ABILITIES AND AND THE STATE

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:24.734
ACHIEVEMENT TEST IN SOME CASES

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.337
ARE UP TO ALMOST CLOSE 240%.

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:30.206
OF AN EFFECT SIZE OF ALMOST

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:33.409
FORTY WHICH IS BEING ABOUT THE

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.844
ACHIEVEMENT GAP SO WERE CAUSING

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:37.013
A GREAT A GREAT PERCENTAGE OF

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:40.383
THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND AND SOME --

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:42.785
SUBJECT A MAN'S AN AN IMPORTANT

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.287
IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET WE ALSO

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.088
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE SPECIAL

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.791
EDUCATION AND GRADE RETENTION.

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.693
BOTH OF WHICH ARE COSTLY AND

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.295
WHAT YOU SEE ON THE SMALL SIDE

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:54.797
AT THE TOP IS THAT TWO YEARS WAS

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:55.965
BETTER THAN.

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.600
ONE AND IT BUT WITH BUT ONE

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.168
STILL HAD SOME HAD HAD

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:01.971
CONSIDERABLE IMPACT.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:03.573
SO WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU ALL ARE

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:05.308
VERY INTERESTED SORRY THAT'S MY

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:07.910
TEXAN ISM COMING OUT I GREW UP

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.478
IN TEXAS --

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:10.413
BY THE WAY THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.215
OTHER STATES THAT HAS NO CLASS

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:14.517
SIZE LIMIT ON PRE K. SO.

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:20.256
YOU GOT OUT SCORE TEXAS ON AS A

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:24.393
THE THE I WANNA TALK ABOUT HOW

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.561
WE GOT FROM.

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.730
A SYSTEM WHICH IN MOST AND MANY

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.932
OF THE CLASSROOM IN MOST OF THE

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:31.400
CLASSROOMS THAT.

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:33.803
THAT THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:35.304
ABBOTT PRICKETT COMING AND THE

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:36.706
TEACHERS DIDN'T WERE NOT

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:37.940
QUALIFIED AND DID NOT HAVE A

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:39.842
BACHELOR'S DEGREE --

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:42.745
AND WE TOOK THAT WORK FORCE AND

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:45.881
GREW THEM TO BE --

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.550
TO BE QUALIFIED INTO WE WE BUILT

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:48.818
ON THE CURRENT WORK FORCE WHEN

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:50.186
WE DID THIS AND WETHINK THAT'S

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.621
A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THING

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:52.922
THEY BROUGHT EXPERTISE AND

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.857
EXPERIENCE FREE FOR ME FROM

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:56.993
YEARS OF WORKING WITH CHILDREN.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.327
THEY HAD SHOWN THEY HAD.

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.463
AT A GREAT APPLICATION FOR THIS

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:02.732
BUT DIDN'T YET HAVE THE FULL

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:04.066
PREPARATION.

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:06.269
AND THAT WAS NECESSARY FOR IT TO

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:07.236
BE A FULLY EDUCATIONAL PRIME

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:08.704
DOESN'T MEAN MANY OF THE MORE

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:10.306
EXCELLENT TEACHERS --

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.841
BUT BUT YOU CAN SEE FROM THE

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:13.242
QUALITY THAT THAT IMPROVE

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:14.977
DRAMATICALLY AS THEY WENT BACK

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:17.980
TO SCHOOL AND GOT MORE TRAINING --

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:19.515
SO HOW DO WE CALL HOW DO WE PAY

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:22.685
FOR THIS AND ITS IT'S AND WHAT

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:26.155
PERSONAL WHAT WHAT DID WE PAY --

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.356
FOR WE HAVEN'T SO.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.158
ON THE ON THE NEXT SLIDE INSIDE

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.294
SEXUAL SEE THAT THEY WERE IT

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.395
STARTED AND THEN WHAT SOME OF

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:34.196
THE REMEDIES WERE ON THE ON THE

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.164
RIGHT HAND SIDE.

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.732
SO WE HAD A LIMITED QUALIFY

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.634
TEACHER POOL WE DON'T EVEN HAVE

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:39.902
A STATE CERTIFICATION AT THE

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:40.369
TIME.

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.805
SO WE WHAT WE PAID FOR WITH

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:44.740
SCHOLARSHIPS THESE ARE FULL

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:46.275
SCHOLARSHIPS THESE ARE NOT.

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:47.576
THIS IS COLLEGE SHIPS WHERE THEY

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.545
DIDN'T HAVE TO LAY OUT THE MONEY

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.147
IN ADVANCE --

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:54.383
AND SO THAT THE MONEY WAS WAS --

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.986
ADMINISTERED BY A THIRD PARTY

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.187
AND ED.

01:05:58.254 --> 01:06:01.957
AND WE ALSO PROVIDED --

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:03.759
RELEASE TIME FOR THE TEACHERS IN

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:06.095
OTHER WORDS IF THEY HAD TO TAKE

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.797
A COURSE DURING THE DAY --

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:10.032
THAT CENTER WOULD GET MONEY FOR

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:12.335
A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:14.370
WE WERE WE WERE ALL IN ON THIS.

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:16.906
AND AND IT WAS MONEY WELL SPENT

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:18.808
BECAUSE NOW WE'RE ELEVATING THE

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:22.144
WORK FORCE AND AND AND MAKING

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:25.014

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:27.116
JOB A GOOD QUALITY JOHN.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.151
WE ALSO HAD IN PLACE WHICH AND I

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:30.553
THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.188
WE HAD A POST BACCALAUREATE

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:33.723
ALTERNATE ROUTE.

THEMSELVES BUT THE COMPETENCIES.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.000
THAT --

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:47.269
TEACHERS WHO HAD OF ASHER STREET

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:48.504
EITHER PUBLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM

OR IN A PRIVATE PROVIDER

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:50.706
CLASSROOM.

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.708

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.910
WITH SUCCESSFULLY WITHIN TWO

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.412
YEARS AND THEN HAVE A SORT OF TO

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:57.646

GET UP THEY WOULD GET PAID ON

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:00.683
THE PAY SCALE BUT IT'LL SLIGHTLY

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.618
LOWER RATE THAN SOMEONE WHO

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.121
ALREADY HAD THEIR CERTIFICATION --

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:06.589
WE HAD SOME SIGNING BONUSES THEN

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:09.291
THE BEGINNING TO GET PEOPLE TO

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:09.925
TO TO TEACH AND THEN BUT THAT

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:11.260
THAT WENT AWAY PRETTY QUICKLY

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:12.995
AND BUT THE BIGGEST THE REALLY

01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:14.196
IMPORTANT THING WAS HAVING

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.431
COMPARABLE SALARIES.

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:17.299
THAT THIS ATTRACTED TEACHERS TO

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:17.967
THIS -- HE

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:18.901
WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TAUGHT

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:20.569
KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST GRADE IF

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:21.036

WE TO REINSTATE THE CERTIFICATE --

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:27.042
BRING A GONE AWAY.

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.810
AND SO I COLLEGES AND

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:28.978
UNIVERSITIES THROUGHOUT THE

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:30.246
STATE EVER NIGHT I MEAN I

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:31.380
REMEMBER I WAS A COLLEGE

EDUCATION PROGRAM AT THE TIME.

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:37.420

01:07:37.486 --> 01:07:39.121
PROPOSAL TO AND I DID.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:40.089
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:41.357
GET THIS ACCOMPLISHED.

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:43.559
WE ALSO THOUGH HAD SCARCITY OF

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:44.093
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.361
FACULTY.

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:47.062
AND AND PARTICULARLY.

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:48.030
THE SCARCITY OF THOSE WHO ARE

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:49.899
EXPERTS AND HOW TO TEACH

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.233

THEY MIGHT HAVE KNOWN FOR FIRST

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:53.836
GRADE BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.171
AND SO --

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:56.739
WHAT WE DID WHEN I WENT TO THE

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.073

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:43.519
EXPERTISE WE FOUND THIS OUT BY

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:45.821
EACH OF THEM SUBMITTED AN ANNUAL

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:46.055
BUDGET.

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.656
AND THERE WERE.

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:49.492
WAS A LOT OF REMEDIATION THAT

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:50.926
HAD TO BE DONE JUST ON HOW TO DO

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:53.896

THEIR ATM MACHINES I'M.

01:08:55.998 --> 01:08:57.633
AS THEIR WAY OF USING DOING ED

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.301
DOING PAYROLL ONE THING IT WAS

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.202
M..

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:01.704
SET SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.172
THAT WENT INTO PLACE AND

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:04.707

TRAINING --

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:13.816
IT IT IT VERY BUT IT WAS ONE OF

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.584
THE THINGS WE HAVE TO WORK ON

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.086
THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES --

01:09:17.152 --> 01:09:19.121

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:23.826
DISTRICT TO HELP.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:26.695
PROVIDE.

01:09:26.762 --> 01:09:28.964
TRAINING FOR AND GUIDANCE TO THE

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:30.299
CENTER DIRECTOR STATES THAT THEY

COULD DO THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:32.935
OF THIS.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.069
WE ALSO PUT IN A CENTER DIRECTOR

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.404
SALARIES GOT HIS IS CRITICALLY

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.639
IMPORTANT THAT WE COULDN'T BE

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:38.641
RAISING THE TEACHER SALARY AND

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:39.208

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.209
DIRECTORS.

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:41.944
AND THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE THE

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.212
MOST MONEY WAS TO HAVE A LARGE

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.548

WE ALSO MADE IT ALMOST

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.055
IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A VERY SMALL

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.991
CENTER BECAUSE THE COSTS OF THAT

01:09:56.058 --> 01:09:57.593
TO FOR TAX THAT THE STATE.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.295
OR JUST AT TOO EXPENSIVE TO TO

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:00.763
GENERATE THE MONEY FOR CENTER

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:03.933
DIRECTOR I CAN TALK MORE ABOUT

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:04.500
THAT IF YOU WANT BUT THIS IS

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:05.100
WEEDY.

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:06.235
SO -- AND

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:08.170
EVERYBODY EVERYBODY NEEDED

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.172

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.374
DATE THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:14.109
IN PARTICULAR COULD BARELY

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.110
WORKED WITH YOUNG CHILDREN AT

WITH YOUNG CHILDREN --

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:23.018
AND WE HAVE SO WE HAD A LOT OF

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.720
WORK AT THE STATE WE HAD TO DO

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:26.755
TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY WAS UP

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:29.291
TO STANDARD --

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:30.893
AND THEN IMPORTANTLY.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.728

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.396
REALLY IMPORTANT AND I I WILL I

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:35.164
WILL.

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.866
URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:39.835
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EXPANSION --

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:42.972
DO YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE.

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:44.473
INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE STATE

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.209
AGENCY TO SUPPORT QUALITY.

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:49.612
NOT AS IT NOT THE GOTCHA

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:51.580
MONITORING KINDS BUT REALLY TO

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:53.148
BE A PARTNER.

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:54.950
TO THE DISTRICTS AND THE

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.518
PROVIDERS AND TO HELP THEM.

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.519
COME IN THERE FOR PROGRAM

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.088
IMPROVEMENT.

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:01.156
AND I ALSO WHEN THEY OFFERED ME

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:02.224
THE JOB OF ASSISTANT

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.959
COMMISSIONER I SAID NOT IF I'M

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.494
NOT SENIOR STAFF.

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.262
THE REASON IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:09.031
MY EGO ALTHOUGH THAT ALWAYS

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:09.331
UNDERSTAND.

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:10.065
IT WAS.

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:13.702
IT WAS BECAUSE PRESCHOOL WAS NEW.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:14.903
TO TO THIS AGENCY AND NOBODY

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:16.839
KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:17.473
AND I SAID I HAVE TO BE AT THE

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:18.440
TABLE.

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:19.942
AND OR THE PERSON IN THIS

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.210
POSITION HAS TO BE AT THE TABLE

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:23.212
SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:24.780
HOW YOUR CONFIGURED BUT I THINK

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:25.914
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:26.915
TO CONSIDER.

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:27.950
IS -- THAT

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:31.387
THAT QUESTIONS ARE BEING

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.555
INFORMED SOMEWHAT BY PROVIDE AN

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:37.626
EXPERT AND EARLY CHILDHOOD --

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.762
IF YOU TURNED ASIDE SEVEN I JUST

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:42.665
WANTED TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT --

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:44.833
HEY HOW WE FINANCED THE WORK

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.335
FORCE SIDE OF THIS SHOULD FIRST

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:47.703
JUST SAY ALL OF THIS CAME OUT OF

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.672
THE GENERAL FUND DID NOT COME

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:51.840
OUT OF CONTROL FUNDING --

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:52.975
AND IT WAS.

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:55.377
A VERY VERY VERY VERY TINY SMALL

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:56.945
PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL BUDGET I

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:59.048
DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY NOW BUT

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:01.250
IT WAS LESS THAN 1%.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.519
OF THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND --

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:09.658
THE BUT THE WAY THAT WE FUNDED

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:10.659
THE WORK.

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:12.027
FOR BUILDING OF THE WORK FORCE

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:13.362
WAS NOT WE DIDN'T DO THIS PLAN

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:15.564
FULLY IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:16.465
THIS HAPPENS --

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:18.701
AND I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN IT IN A

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:20.235
WAY THAT MAKES SENSE BUT WHEN

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:21.637
UNIVERSAL PRE K. IS FULLY

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:22.938
IMPLEMENTED.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:25.340
THE COST PER YEAR IS ABOUT WHAT

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.141
KICK TWELVE COSTS.

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:28.577
AND SO IF YOU THINK OF THAT

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:30.446
YOU'RE ADDING A YEAR PUBLIC

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:31.914
EDUCATION THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.148
I MEAN IF YOU THINK IF YOU'RE

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:34.316
GOING TO DO UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL%

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.051
AND I MEAN THIS IS JUST A WAY TO

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:38.287
THINK ABOUT THIS --

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:39.988
BUT IN START UP YEARS IS NOT A

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:41.290
COST THAT MUCH.

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:42.591
BECAUSE TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:43.692
FULLY QUALIFIED THEY'RE NOT IN

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.527
BECOMING SAID AT THAT LEVEL YOU

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:46.929
YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE JUST AREN'T

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.597
GOING TO HAVE THAT MANY COSTS

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:49.965
BUT SO THAT.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.333
IF YOU STILL THINK ABOUT THE

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.534
FULL COST.

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.303
SOME OF THAT CAN BEAT CAN BE

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:58.474
DEVOTED --

01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.141
TO SUPPORTING TEACHERS IN

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.109
GETTING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE SO

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.276
EASY YOU JUST HAVE TO THINK

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.277
ABOUT THE COSTS A LITTLE

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:03.412
DIFFERENTLY AND LAYER THEM

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:04.713
DIFFERENTLY IN OVERTIME BECAUSE

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.815
MORE AND MORE INTO SALARIES AND

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.617
LESS AND LESS AND LESS INTO.

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:12.254
PREPARING PEOPLE.

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:15.357
HAD I DO KATIE WAS THAT CLOSE.

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:17.159
CAPE HELP ME PRACTICE THAT I

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.495
THINK -- AND

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:21.263
I WANT TO SAY WE HAD A 2% SET

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.699
ASIDE FOR ARE ALL FROM MY OFFICE.

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.567
OUT OF THE FOR TOTAL BUDGET AND

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:26.201
SET IT.

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:27.736
SO THAT WE COULD FIND RESEARCH

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:30.105
AND AND ADD TRY TO DO

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.074
EXPERIMENTS WE DIDN'T EXPERIMENT

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:35.711
OF LOOKING AT LONGER DAY VERSUS

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:38.680
SHORTER DAY WE DIDN'T AT DO A

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:40.649
LANGUAGE.

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:42.451
SO WE TRIED TO THE QUESTIONS

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.686
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE GOOD ANSWERS

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:45.754
FOR WE HAVE A NOW FOR YOU SO YOU

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:46.855
DON'T NEED TO DO THAT BUT IF YOU

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.023
HAVE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP YOU

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.124
DON'T HAVE GOOD ANSWERS FOR

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.826
RATHER THAN WHOLESALE DOING

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:51.360
ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE OF

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:52.761
CALIFORNIA.

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:55.030
TRY IT OUT A COUPLE PLACES

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.098
BEFORE YOU.

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:57.432
BUTTE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T RIGHT

01:13:57.499 --> 01:13:59.034
THE SHIP IS REALLY HARD TO WRITE

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.936
ONCE IT ONCE IT'S ONCE IT'S IN

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:02.638
PLACE.

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:05.140
AND THEN THE THE NEXT SIDE.

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:06.875
TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OTHER

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.378
CRITICAL DECISIONS AND I'VE

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:09.978
HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.914
ALREADY SO IT WON'T SPEND A LOT

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.749
OF TIME ON BUT YOU WERE JUST

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.851
TRYING TO THE GOVERNANCE ISSUE --

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.719
AND ALSO ADMINISTRATION DO YOU

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.321
HAVE TO HAVE THIS ALL HOUSING

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:20.689
ONE AGENCY DO YOU MAY ADMINISTER

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:23.025
CLOSER TO THE GROUND AND A MORE

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.828
LOCAL LOCAL WAY --

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:28.197
OBVIOUSLY WHAT WHAT PROGRAMS ARE

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:30.165
ELIGIBLE TO BE PART OF THIS IS A

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.634
DECISION THAT HAS TO BE MADE --

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:33.635
AND THEN HOW DO YOU DISTRIBUTE

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:34.803
THE FUNDS ARE THEY IS A

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.305
COMPETITIVE AS IT DIRECTOR

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.673
PROGRAM OR DO YOU HAVE SOME

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.608
INTERMEDIARY AND OUR CASE IT WAS

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:41.143
A SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS THE

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:44.012
INTERMEDIARY --

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:46.215
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE.

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:48.016
FACILITIES AN INTEGRATED DATA

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:50.185
SYSTEMS YOU YEAH YOU CAN MAKE

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:51.653
THIS HAPPEN TO YOU CAN INSURANCE

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.422
CAN BE HIGH QUALITY IF YOU DON'T

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:57.125
SUPPORT THAT THOSE --

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:58.260
AND THEN --

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:59.661
WE ARE TO TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAM

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:02.297
THE PROGRAM COMPONENTS --

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:04.066
BUT I ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:05.767
IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE'RE SEEING

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.269
IN NEW JERSEY.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.136
AS YOU HAVE TO BUILDING

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:10.706
MECHANISMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:12.975
AND NOT JUST OF THE FUNDING BUT

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:14.476
OF A QUALITY.

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:16.044
THAT WE WE HAVE I CAN POINT YOU

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:17.179
TO A COUPLE OF STATES WERE

01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:18.747
QUALITY HAS BEEN ERODING IN NEW

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.282
JERSEY IS ONE OF THEM AND IT'S

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.617
VERY CONCERNING.

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:23.252
AND SO THINKING ABOUT HOW TO

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.586
MAKE SURE THAT WHAT YOU BILLS

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:27.556
HERE IT IS IS STILL HERE IN

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:29.892
TWENTY YEARS.

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.426
AND THEN I HAVE TO EXAMPLES FROM

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:33.061
OTHER STATES AND I'M NOT SURE

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:34.196
WHETHER YOU ALL ARE GETTING

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:36.398
TIRED OF HEARING ME OR I SHOULD

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:38.100
KEEP GOING.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.034
OKAY.

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:40.936
OKAY -- THE

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:46.308
I JUST WANTED. TO TO REDUCE THE

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.609
CHAIRMAN MCCARTY TALKED ABOUT TO

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:50.712
A TO READ STATES IN ALABAMA

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:51.947
NORTH CAROLINA ARE GOOD EXAMPLES

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.248
OF THIS THERE.

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:55.584
THEY ARE LEADERS IN AND PRE K.

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:56.551
NORTH CAROLINA --

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:59.054
AND AN EARLY LEADER IN ALABAMA

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:01.990
I'M MORE RECENT --

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:02.591
ONE OUT I LOVE ELEMENT IN THE

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:06.395
NAME OF ALLAH CLASS.

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.829
FIRST CLASS FREE K..

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:10.899
F. -- AND

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:12.768
THE THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:13.568
ABOUT ALL OF THEM I WILL FIRST

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:14.937
OF ALL IF IT MEETS ALL OF THE

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:16.738
TEN BENCHMARKS AND HAS A VERY

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:18.307
STRONG ENABLING ENVIRONMENT.

01:16:18.373 --> 01:16:19.408
IT IS GOVERNED OUT OF A

01:16:19.474 --> 01:16:21.410
STANDALONE EARLY LEARNING

01:16:21.476 --> 01:16:22.411
DEPARTMENT.

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.813
AT A SECOND IT HAS A SECRETARY

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.148
LEVEL APPOINT LEAD.

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:28.183
AND I THINK THAT CAUSES PROBLEMS

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.285
IN TERMS OF THE CAGE WALL

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:31.820
CONTINUITY BUT IT ALSO.

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:34.589
IT MAKES THINGS EASIER ACROSS

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:37.326
THE WHOLE SPECTRUM --

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:41.496
ZERO TO FIVE AND THEY THEY USE A

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:42.798
COMPETITIVE GRANT NEXT DELIVERY

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:44.266
SYSTEM SO THEY HAVE TO THAT

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:45.634
MEANS THAT THE THAT THEY ARE

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.336
DEPARTMENT HAS.

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.237
TO APPROVE EVERY GRANT THAT

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:51.106
COMES IN FOR A PRE K. PROGRAM --

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:51.907
SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:53.608
YOU HAVE TO WEIGH IN IN IN

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:55.077
THINKING ABOUT IT.

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:56.144
THEY'VE HAD REALLY RAPID

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:58.714
EXPANSION FROM 6% OF THEIR FOUR

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.016
YEAR OLDS 224% IN LESS THAN FIVE

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.617
YEARS AND THEY AVE ALL THEY

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:04.886
HAVE A PLANNED EXPANSION I THINK

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.154
THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL THEY

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:07.389
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.057
THEY'RE GOING TO SCALE.

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:10.625
THIS FOR FOR ALL KIDS ARE LONE

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.894
CAM K?T IT'S IT'S STARTING LOW

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.029
INCOME BUT IT WILL BE UNIVERSAL

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:16.231
AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER THING

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.532
IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE YOU GONNA.

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:19.334
IN NEW JERSEY WE ARE EXPANSION

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.336
HAS WORKED WITH FIRST THESE LOW

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:22.838
INCOME SMALLER DISTRICTS IT WAS

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:26.241
UNIVERSAL WITHIN THOSE DISTRICTS

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.976
YOU COULD BE A WEALTHY.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:28.944
FAMILY IN YOUR CHILD IS STILL

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:30.379
GOING TO ELIGIBLE BECAUSE PUBLIC

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:30.612
SCHOOL.

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:33.915
AND THE WE'RE EXPANDING NOW IT

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:35.884
TO THE NEXT.

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:38.220
NEXT HERE OF DISTRICTS SAID

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:39.287
THERE'D LESS LOW INCOME

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:40.255
DISTRICTS BUT THEY'RE STILL HAVE

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.190
A HIGH PROPORTION OF LOW INCOME

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:43.291
FAMILIES --

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:45.160
AND SO THAT'S ONE WAY TO THINK

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:46.461
ABOUT TEARING THIS SO THAT

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:47.462
YOU'RE SO YOU'RE MEETING THE

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:49.264
NEEDIEST FIRST BUT KNOWING THAT

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:51.733
PRE K. AS IT --

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.768
IS BENEFICIAL TO ALL.

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.836
SO IT AND AND ALSO THERE'S OTHER

01:17:54.903 --> 01:17:57.406
REASONS WE WE HAVE SOME SOME.

01:17:57.472 --> 01:17:59.775
HENCE THAT A CRITICAL MASS

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.076
COMING INTO KINDERGARTEN MATTERS

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:02.377
SO IF YOU'RE ONLY SERVING LOW

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:03.612
INCOME CHILDREN.

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:05.947
WHO HAVE HAD THIS PROGRAM --

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:06.515
YOU THE KINDERGARTEN DOESN'T

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:09.484
MISS WHAT AND THEN THAT MAY BE

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:12.421
ONE REASON WE'RE NOT SING

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:15.891
PROGRAMS --

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:18.360
SO --

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:19.961
ALABAMA SOUND EFFECTS INTO.

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:21.163
ENTER THE SCHOOL GRADES NORTH

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:23.098
CAROLINA IS A MUCH LONGER

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:25.434
STANDING PROGRAM IT'S BEGINNING

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.269
IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:29.571
PROGRAMS IT'S GETTING ERODED.

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:33.075
AND IT WAS PART OF JIM HUNTS

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:35.077
HOLD EDUCATION APPROACH WERE HAD

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.678
A CHILDREN'S CABINET AND THERE

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:38.280
WAS A GREAT DEAL OF EMPHASIS ON

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:40.515
HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION AND NOW

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:42.551
NORTH CAROLINA AT THE TIME.

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.419
THEY ALSO EXCEEDED THEM NEAR TEN

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.121
BENCHMARKS THEY HAVE.

01:18:46.188 --> 01:18:48.557
THAT THE TEACH PROGRAM WHICH IS

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:50.525
A REALLY INTERESTING WAY OF A

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:51.593
PROVIDING SCHOLARSHIP AND

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.828
SUPPORTED TEACHERS AS THEY GO

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:55.297
BACK TO SCHOOL WAS FOUNDED IN

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:56.298
NORTH CAROLINA AND ACTUALLY

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:57.999
CREATED BY THE STATE THERE.

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.668
BUT IS NOW BEING USED IN TWENTY

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:01.203
OTHER STATES --

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:02.471
YOUR WAGES PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:03.972
USED IS ALSO ONE THAT CAME OUT

01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:07.209
OF NORTH CAROLINA AND THE VISION

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:10.145
AND SOME LOCATIONS --

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:11.513
THEY HAVE PAYING ENHANCEMENT.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.514
OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.916
CLASSROOMS BUT NOT PAY PARITY.

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:17.986
AT EVENT THEY ALSO HAVE AFFECTS

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:19.888
INTO THE SCHOOL GRADES.

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:21.957
SO I'M HAPPY. TO TO TALK MORE

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:24.326
ABOUT OTHER STATES BUT LET ME

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:25.760
JUST MAKE A FEW CONCLUSION.

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:27.562
INCLUSIONS WE KNOW THAT MANY

01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:28.563
PRESCHOOL FUNDS ARE NOT

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.098
DELIVERING.

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:32.734
THE DESIRED RESULTS.

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:33.502
AND WE THINK AN ADEQUATE.

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:35.704
AND ADEQUATELY PREPARED TEACHERS

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.273
IS LIKELY ONE OF THOSE REASONS --

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.008
BUT AGAIN NO SINGLE INGREDIENT.

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.176
I'M.

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:41.843
THE ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:44.679
ONLY PRO HIGHLY EDUCATED WELL

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:46.515
PAID TEACHERS [inaudible]

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:48.583
HAVE.

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.519
ON AFFECTS THAT ARE LASTING.

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:52.320
WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS ALL THE BODY

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:54.189
OF RESEARCH THAT ONCE THAT THAT

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:55.991
SHOW THAT HAD TEACHERS LIKE THAT

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:56.525
THEN THAT'S?

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:57.993
THAT'S THE AND SO THAT'S AN

01:19:58.059 --> 01:19:59.594
IMPORTANT AND COMPELLING REASON

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:00.729
THE OTHER IS.

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:01.363
THAT.

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:03.265
THIS THEN BUILT A WORKFORCE THAT

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:05.400
IS WELL PAID AND AND AND IS A

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.802
GOOD AT AND AND IT HELPS THE

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:08.537
COMMUNITY IN GENERAL

01:20:08.603 --> 01:20:08.837
[inaudible]

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:12.407
THE IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:13.909
AND ALL KINDS OF WORKING

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:15.510
CONDITIONS ARE IMPORTANT IN

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:17.445
ADDITION TO THE PAY.

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:19.247
BUT ALL THE OTHER PROGRAM.

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:20.315
COMPONENTS THAT WE'VE TALKED

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:21.449
ABOUT NEED.

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:23.552
ALSO NEED TO BE IN PLACE.

01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:24.486

EITHER MONEY OR OTHER IN OTHER

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:38.853
RESOURCES AS TO WHAT.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.221
THE STATE SAVES MAY BE A

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:42.257
REDUCTION ACROSS RACIAL RATES

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.559
MAY BE ABOUT --

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:45.593
TO APE.

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.128
OF EMPLOYABLE.

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:47.862
GRADUATES COMING OUT OF HIGH

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:49.097
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE IS YOUR

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:50.699
INCREASING YOUR TAX BASE.

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:52.167
OF IT CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:53.568
AND AND SAY IT SEE IF THERE IS

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.370
DATA OR IF NOT IF THERE WE CAN

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:56.838
EXPECT DATA SINCE THESE PROGRAMS

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:57.906
ARE GETTING TO A POINT WHERE.

01:22:57.972 --> 01:23:00.575
THOSE LITTLE DOLLARS NOW ARE YOU

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:01.276
ENTERING THE WORK FORCE ONE IDEA.

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:03.144
THEN THEY'RE NOT QUITE THE

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:05.146
ALMOST IRVINE HIGH SCHOOL OF THE

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:07.415
CULVERT WERE STUDYING M. IS IN

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:08.650
HIGH SCHOOL OKAY AND WE'RE WE

JUST GOT FUNDING TO LOOK AT THAT

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:12.120
THEM.

01:23:12.187 --> 01:23:17.425
FURTHER ON AND AND MUCH TO MY

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:20.628
DISMAY.

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:22.364
ISN'T IT AND IS ALSO AN

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:26.201
ECONOMIST HAS NOT DONE THE COST

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:28.636
BENEFIT ANALYSIS YET.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.472
SO HE IS THE WAS THE INITIAL

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:31.840
ECONOMIST ON THE PERRY PRESCHOOL

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.608

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.110
DERIAN STUDY --

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:37.846
BUT THE REASON THAT HE HASN'T IS

01:23:37.912 --> 01:23:38.813
BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.381
DATA.

01:23:39.447 --> 01:23:41.816
THAT TO TO TO DO WE COULD DO

01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:45.587
SOME VERY VERY FUZZY.

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:47.088
THE KIND OF THING ECONOMIST TO A

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:49.891
WHOLE LOT OF OF YET PREDICTING

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:50.759
WHAT WHAT MIGHT BE THE EFFECTS

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:52.193
BUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.528
WAIT A LITTLE BIT AND AND WE'RE

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:56.364
SO LITTLE UNDER FIND IT SO IF

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:58.299
ANY OF THE ONE OF THE FIRST SHIP

01:23:58.366 --> 01:23:58.767
SOME.

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.935
CALIFORNIA DOLLARS TO US TO FUND

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:01.603
THIS WEEKEND.

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:02.804
WILL BE BETTER BUT I THINK THE

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.839
THING WE KNOW IS THAT THE

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:08.810
SAVINGS COME FROM THREE TENSION.

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.412
THAT THAT CRIME AND DELINQUENCY

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:12.247
EAT MOST MOST OF THE SAVINGS

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:13.982
FROM THAT COME IN ADULTHOOD BUT

01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:17.318
SOME COME IN IN HIGH SCHOOL --

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:18.953
AND THEN THE TAXPAYER OBVIOUSLY

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.188
THEY HAVE TO GET INTO THE WORK

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:21.689
FORCE BEFORE WE CAN.

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:22.924
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL BE

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:24.459
ABLE TO STUDY THIS COHORT THAT

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:25.994
WELL -- TECH

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:27.195
BUT WE CAN BEGIN AT LEAST WITH

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:29.130
THE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA I THINK

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.398
THEY'LL BE VERY HELPFUL IN

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:31.232
PARTICULAR IN A COUPLE YEARS

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:32.367
WHEN THEY DO INTO THE WORK FORCE

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:33.768
YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY WERE.

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:35.637
DROP OUTS HOW HOW MANY MADE

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:36.638
UNFORTUNATE COME ADDRESSES SOME

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:37.539
VERSES.

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:39.474
ARE COMPATIBLE POPULATIONS THAT

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:40.442
DON'T HAVE THAT REALLY CHALLENGE

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:42.310
CASE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:42.977
QUESTIONS ALWAYS GONNA COME UP

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.712
AS ARTICLE A COUPLE TIMES OF THE

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:45.480
COST.

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:46.881
AND SO WE CAN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:47.982
THIS IS ACTUALLY A SAVE US A

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:49.617
WHOLE LOT OF MONEY EVEN PUTTING

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:50.685
TEACHERS GOING IN THE COLLEGE

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:51.286
DEGREE IS MAKE SURE THEY'RE

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.320
CERTIFIED.

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:54.289
YES THAT COST A LOT UP FRONT BUT

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:56.057
IT WILL SAVE US A WHOLE LOT MORE

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:57.592
LATER ON AND SO I REALLY

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.693

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:46.294
WAYS AND I'M SPECIFICALLY MY

01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:47.462
QUESTION IS THE COMMISSION ON

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:59.140
MORE ON HOW CONCEPTS ARE APPLIED

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:00.408
TO IMPROVE TEACHING INSTEAD OF

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:03.077
JUST FOCUSING ON THE UNITS TAKEN --

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:04.045
HAS THIS BEEN DONE IN OTHER

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.446
STATES ARE THEIR SUCCESSFUL

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:07.548
PROGRAMS THAT DON'T REQUIRE A

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:11.619
BACHELOR'S DEGREE BUT HAVE HIGH

01:28:11.686 --> 01:28:13.955
QUALITY BENCHMARKS AND OUTCOMES.

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:14.656
SO.

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:15.556
I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:17.025
STATES THAT USE A COMPETENCY

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:18.459
BASED --

01:28:18.526 --> 01:28:21.963
SYSTEM THAT WE LOOK FIRST ABOUT

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.098
THE SYSTEM IN NEW JERSEY.

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:26.501
I AN ULTIMATE AND I KNOW THAT A

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:27.835
COUPLE OF OTHER STATES DID AS

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:29.470
WELL WE WE CAME TO THE

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:30.905
CONCLUSION THAT IT WOULD COST AS

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.874
MUCH AND BE SUCH A CUMBERSOME

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.209
BUREAUCRACY.

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:38.179
THAT IT IT JUST WASN'T.

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:39.013
AT WHICH IT WE ARE.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.281
ALSO WANTED THIS TO BE SEEN AS

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:41.449
IT BECAUSE IT WAS PUBLIC

01:28:41.516 --> 01:28:44.152
EDUCATION --

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:46.421
AND SO WHY SHOULD THE STANDARDS

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:48.089
AND AND MAKE IT DOESN'T SPEAK

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:49.357
DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT SHOULD

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:50.491
BE THAT THE TEACHERS ARE

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:52.326
PREPARED FOR THIS AGE LEVEL.

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:53.361
AND FOR TEACHING WELL IN THE

01:28:53.428 --> 01:28:55.730
SENSE LEVEL BUT WE WE REALLY WE

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:57.031
WE STRUGGLE WITH THAT I WILL SAY

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.800
THERE ARE OTHER PLATE PLACES

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:00.568
TRYING TO COME UP WITH THAT --

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:02.103
PHILADELPHIA RIGHT NOW IS

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.905

IS LOOKING AT AN APPLIED VA --

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:14.849
WHICH WOULD DOES NOT COME WITH

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:17.285
THE CERTIFICATION --

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:19.887

BENEFITS TO SHOW FROM IT YET

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:23.658

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:00.501
THAT YOU GET --

01:34:00.568 --> 01:34:02.837

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:24.291
BUT I WOULD SAY --

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:26.160
IF WE COULD GET A BETTER.

01:34:26.227 --> 01:34:27.328
IF THE PUBLIC WE HAD A BETTER

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:28.863
PERCEPTION OF TEACHERS AND

01:34:28.929 --> 01:34:30.698

01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:38.039
DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:39.540
SOMETHING YOU CAN SOLVE WITH

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:41.842
LEGISLATION --

THAT.

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:46.066
SCENARIO REALLY WELL --

01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:46.967
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STATE PRE K.

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:48.769
PROGRAM DECIDED THEY WERE GOING

01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:50.037
TO EXPAND SO THEY REDUCE THEIR

01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:52.506
REQUIREMENTS AND I AT LEAST KNEW

01:41:52.573 --> 01:41:54.341

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:07.821
I I I DON'T KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.056
DO AN EXPERIMENT OF A HIGH

01:42:09.122 --> 01:42:11.758
QUALITY A VERSES A HIGH QUALITY

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:14.895

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:18.265
BUT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:42:18.332 --> 01:42:21.635
WHAT WE WOULD GET FROM THAT --

01:42:21.702 --> 01:42:23.570
AB AND I ALSO IT DEPENDS SO MUCH

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:25.205
ON THE OTHER SUPPORTS AROUND

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:28.442
THAT THE TEACHER BUT I I HAVE TO

01:42:28.509 --> 01:42:29.877

WITH CERTIFICATION [inaudible]

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:37.050
AND I I MEAN THAT'S ALL I CAN

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:38.585
WORK FROM AS WHAT THE RESEARCH

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:39.486
THAT AGAIN THAT'S WE LEARNED IT

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:40.654
IN NEW JERSEY AS I WAS REALLY

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:41.555
IMPRESSED.

01:42:41.622 --> 01:42:43.190
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE NEXT PANEL.

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:45.526
THAT IT WAS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

01:42:45.592 --> 01:42:45.826
FOR A LOT.

01:42:45.893 --> 01:42:47.127
OF WORK.

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:48.629
FOR GETTING THE HIGHER

01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:50.330
CREDENTIAL AND THEN PAYING THEM

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:52.266
ADEQUATELY AND IT HELPS THEM AND

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:54.034
THEIR FAMILIES --

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:57.437
BUT ALSO STATE BECAUSE THERE'S

01:42:57.504 --> 01:42:59.172
NOT THE NEED TO JUMP TO GO.

01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:00.707
OUT OF WORK IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:02.342
OR A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY

01:43:02.409 --> 01:43:03.710
ASSISTANT TEACHERS ALSO GOT

01:43:03.777 --> 01:43:04.845
CORRECT.

01:43:04.912 --> 01:43:06.179

AND FACILITIES I UNDERSTOOD

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:57.598
STILL IS ALL THAT EVEN IF YOU

01:43:57.664 --> 01:43:59.299
HAD THE HIGHER CLASS SIZE AS

01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:00.701
LONG AS YOU HAVE.

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:02.869

REMOTE ADDRESS.

01:44:07.708 --> 01:44:09.276
THEIR NATION ABOUT THE QUALIFY

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:10.477
TEACHER.

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:11.645
HOW MANY QUALIFIED TEACHERS HE

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:14.047
AND I HAVE IN THAT YEAH AND SO

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:15.716
THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN --

01:44:15.782 --> 01:44:18.552
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DATA ON A

01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:20.854
LOW RATIO WITH A WITH A HIGH

01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:23.090
CLASS SIZE SO I I DON'T I CAN'T

01:44:23.156 --> 01:44:23.724
SAY FOR SURE BUT IT'S PRETTY

01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:25.826
HARD YOU'RE YOU'RE STILL

01:44:25.892 --> 01:44:28.228
DELUDING THAT THE HIGHEST

01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:29.730
QUALIFIED YET EACH YEAR THE

01:44:29.796 --> 01:44:31.698
AMONG TEACHER WITH YOUR CHILD IS

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:31.999
THE SECOND.

01:44:32.065 --> 01:44:32.499
OR TEACHER WOULD HAVE.

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:36.303
ALSO STRESS THAT COMES FROM NOT

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:37.337
NOT JUST FOR THE TEACHERS.

01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:38.372
BUT STRESS FOR THE CHILDREN THAT

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:39.906
COMES FROM BEING IN SUCH LARGE

01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:41.408
GROUPS --

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:43.610
AND I I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:44.745
THINGS WE DON'T KNOW I'M JUST

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:47.114
NOW I'M DOING MY I'M DEVELOPMENT

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:48.348
PSYCHOLOGIST SO IT'S NOT

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:50.784
ARMCHAIR PSYCHOLOGY I'M ACTUALLY

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:52.352
AM A PSYCHOLOGIST.

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:54.488
BUT I I I SO I DON'T HAVE DATA

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:55.455
TO SAY THAT.

01:44:55.522 --> 01:44:56.857
THE LARGER THE CLASSES THE MORE

01:44:56.923 --> 01:44:59.826
STRESSFUL IT IS BUT IT CERTAINLY.

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:01.161
IS A REASONABLE TERM AND NOT

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:02.629
THAT I'M SANCTIONING THIS BUT

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:04.931
THE T. K. RATIOS ARE JUST

01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:07.367
ATROCIOUS AND I CAN IMAGINE.

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:10.871
THAT TOO K. TEACHER WITH TWENTY

01:45:10.937 --> 01:45:15.042
FIVE DON'T HAVE. EIGHT TWELVE

01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:15.676
NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:16.543
SO WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE

01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:18.779
FACT THAT WE'VE HAD WE HAVE HAD

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:20.013
SUCCESS WITH OUR T. K.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.883
IMPLANTATION AND I LOOK NEAR.

01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:24.718
GET A RESEARCHER A ARE WHEN THE

01:45:24.785 --> 01:45:25.318
GROUP DID A STUDY RECENTLY AND

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:26.286
THEY SHOWED.

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:27.921
GREAT GAINES AND THOSE CLASSES

01:45:27.988 --> 01:45:31.024
HAVE THESE CRAZY TEACHER STUDENT

01:45:31.091 --> 01:45:33.427
RATIO SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU

01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:34.227
SORT THAT OUT.

01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:35.228
I DON'T KNOW --

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:36.430
I I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST THAT

01:45:36.496 --> 01:45:38.265
THEY ARE SUCH A RESTRICTED AGE

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:40.634
RANGE THAT THAT OLDER FORCE YEAH

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:43.270
THAT THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE --

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:45.706
LA AND I'D LIKE TO SEE IF IT HOW

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:47.808
IT HOW IT IMPACTS IN THE LONG

01:45:47.874 --> 01:45:49.242
RUN -- NTK

01:45:49.309 --> 01:45:51.111
ISN'T AS IT'S NOT INCOME AND

01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:52.579
THERE'S NO INCOME ELIGIBILITY

01:45:52.646 --> 01:45:54.081
THERE EITHER AND I THINK I THINK

01:45:54.147 --> 01:46:00.320
I WOULD SAY THAT I I DO BELIEVE.

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:01.855
FIVE AND AGAIN AT PLEASE WHEN I

01:46:01.922 --> 01:46:02.522
SAID I BELIEVE IT MEANS THAT I'M

01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:03.490
BEING RESEARCH INFORMED ABOUT

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:06.259
NOT RESEARCH BASED --

01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:09.262
THAT -- THAT --

01:46:09.329 --> 01:46:11.932
THE THE LESS CONCENTRATION OF OF

01:46:11.998 --> 01:46:13.734
POVERTY THAT YOU HAVE IN THE

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:14.968
CLASSROOM [inaudible]

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:17.370
IN OTHER.

01:46:17.437 --> 01:46:19.206
POTENTIAL --

01:46:19.272 --> 01:46:20.340
CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAN MAKE

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:24.611
THE FIVE HARDER FOR CHILDREN --

01:46:24.678 --> 01:46:25.378
THE LARGER THE CLASS I SCAN.

01:46:25.445 --> 01:46:27.781
SO IN NEW JERSEY FOR EXAMPLE OUR

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:30.217
CLASSES IS QUITE LOW IT'S

01:46:30.283 --> 01:46:31.718
FIFTEEN WHICH AT THE TIME WAS

01:46:31.785 --> 01:46:33.019
THE BEST EVIDENCE THE BEST

01:46:33.086 --> 01:46:35.155
EVIDENCE WE HAD SAID THAT IT

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:37.824
SHOULD BE FIFTEEN IN A ONE TO AS

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:40.560
SEVEN OR EIGHT RATIO BUT WE'RE

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:43.230
EXPANDING. TO THESE LESS HIGH

01:46:43.296 --> 01:46:45.766
CONCENTRATED POVERTY DISTRICTS

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:47.667
WITH.

01:46:47.734 --> 01:46:48.502
FIFTEEN SHOULD WE BE

01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:50.504
EXPERIMENTING TO SEE IF EIGHTEEN

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:51.905
WHICH WOULD BE OKAY AND SAVE

01:46:51.972 --> 01:46:53.507
SOME MONEY THAT WAY AND BE ABLE

01:46:53.573 --> 01:46:55.041
TO EXPAND MASTER.

01:46:55.108 --> 01:46:55.909
AGAIN I WOULD SAY EXPERIMENT

01:46:55.976 --> 01:46:57.844
FIND OUT RATHER THAN JUST DO IT

01:46:57.911 --> 01:46:58.979
AND THEN FIND OUT.

01:46:59.045 --> 01:47:00.514
AND I DON'T WANT CHILDREN TO

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:04.384
LOSE ANOTHER YEAR AND FALL WE

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:06.186
AND WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT.

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:08.121
OKAY THANK YOU ANY FURTHER

01:47:08.188 --> 01:47:10.123

BEHIND US WHICH IS INCREDIBLY

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:18.258
EXCITING.

HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY ACHIEVED

01:48:30.637 --> 01:48:32.138
BY OTHER STATES AND THAT WAS MY

01:48:32.205 --> 01:48:33.506
FIRST AHA MOMENT.

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:35.175
WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM

01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:36.776
OTHER HIGH PERFORMING STATES BUT

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:38.445
SOME OF THIS ROAD WILL BE

01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:39.813
UNIQUELY CARVE BY CALIFORNIA'S

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.314

GOAL LINE FOR THE COUNTRY WHICH

CONTEXT OF RESOURCES AND

01:48:53.293 --> 01:48:54.561
ARTICULATION.

CHILDREN OR CANNOT BE CONSIDERED

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:21.187
A SILVER BULLET FOR THE

ACHIEVEMENT GAP IT'S PART OF A

01:49:22.789 --> 01:49:24.724
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO BEING

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:25.725
THE FORTY FIRST NATION IN PER

01:49:25.792 --> 01:49:27.260
PUPIL SPENDING.

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:29.162
COMPARED TO SECOND SEVENTH AND

01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:31.464
EIGHTH IN THE NATION WHICH IS

01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:32.098
WHAT WE WERE SAYING ON THE EAST

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:33.633
COAST.

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.235
AND THIS ARTICULATION AT THAT WE

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:37.170
SAW HAD RESPECT FOR COMMUNITY

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:39.606
BASED MIX DELIVERY CHILD

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:41.007
DEVELOPMENT BASED APPROACHES

01:49:41.074 --> 01:49:42.709
WASN'T ABOUT PUSHING KATE TWELVE

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:43.276
DOWN.

01:49:43.343 --> 01:49:44.978
INTO WHAT WORKS FOR CHILDREN BUT

01:50:21.815 --> 01:50:23.049
LEVEL.

01:50:23.116 --> 01:50:24.818
THIS IS COMPLEX IMPLEMENTATION

01:50:24.884 --> 01:50:26.953
WORK AND REQUIRES HIGH LEVEL

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:28.888
ROBUST SUPPORT FROM THE

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:29.422
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:30.557
EDUCATION.

01:50:30.623 --> 01:50:32.058
WE HAVE START OUR STATE LEVEL

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:33.493
SYSTEMS FOR DECADES AND WE HAVE

EVERYTHING SHE SAYS.

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:44.704
WE DIVIDED LABOR --

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:47.507
IS SYSTEMS CAPACITY FOR DECADES

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:49.009
CALIFORNIA HAS STRONG TOGETHER

01:50:49.075 --> 01:50:50.877
LITTLE CRUMBS OF EVIDENCE BASED

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:52.812
PROGRAMS AROUND INSTRUCTIONAL

01:50:52.879 --> 01:50:55.248
SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS IT MAKES ME

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:56.983
THINK OF THE PRESCHOOL TEACHERS

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:58.251
FOR LOOPBACK LESS.

01:50:58.318 --> 01:50:59.352
YOU KNOW AND SO RATHER THAN HAVE

01:50:59.419 --> 01:51:00.653
A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:02.322
INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT THAT WE

01:51:02.389 --> 01:51:03.323
SEE IN HIGH PERFORMING

01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:04.824
CALIFORNIA AND NATIONAL

01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:06.026
CLASSROOMS.

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:08.461

THE BACK OFFICE.

01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:12.265
AND SO THAT NECKLACE HAS TO BE

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:16.503
REPLACED WITH SYSTEMS CAPACITY

01:51:16.569 --> 01:51:18.138
HIGHER EDUCATION CAPACITY

01:51:18.204 --> 01:51:19.839
MENTORING CAPACITY AND

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:26.546

EDUCATIONAL CONTINUUM.

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:53.673
AND AS CORPS TO ADDRESSING ALL

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.542
OF THE OPPORTUNITY GAPS THAT CAN

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:57.577
HELP PREVENT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:59.012
WE KNOW THAT DECADES OF RESEARCH

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.480
HAVE STAND THAT SIGNIFICANT

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:01.915
INVESTMENTS IN THE EARLY YEARS

01:52:01.981 --> 01:52:03.283
OF A CHILD'S LIFE HAVE AN

01:52:03.349 --> 01:52:06.319
ENORMOUS POSITIVE IMPACT ACROSS

01:52:06.386 --> 01:52:08.121
THE SPECTRUM OF OUTCOMES.

01:52:08.188 --> 01:52:09.389
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN MAKING

01:52:09.456 --> 01:52:11.191
POSITIVE STEPS TOWARDS EXPANDING

01:52:11.257 --> 01:52:13.359
ACCESS TO QUALITY EARLY LEARNING

01:52:13.426 --> 01:52:14.861

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:20.533
EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO HAVE A

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.402
GOVERNOR WHO IS NOW JUMPING AND

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:23.503

INTO THAT AS WELL AS A

01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:26.139
SUPERINTENDENT.

01:52:26.206 --> 01:52:28.341
AS WE CONTEMPLATE EXPANDING

01:52:28.408 --> 01:52:30.143
PRESCHOOL AND DEVELOPING A

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:31.611
BLUEPRINT FOR SYSTEM EXPANSION

01:52:31.678 --> 01:52:33.113
TOWARDS MOVING FORWARD THERE WAS

01:52:33.179 --> 01:52:34.681
A LOT TO LEARN FROM FROM OTHER

01:52:34.747 --> 01:52:35.648
STATES.

01:52:35.715 --> 01:52:36.683
BUT I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE

01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:38.218
THAT CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A LOT

01:52:38.284 --> 01:52:40.420
TO SHARE AND A LOT OF ASSETS

01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:42.122
THAT ARE MORE UNIQUE TO ASK.

01:52:42.188 --> 01:52:44.557
ON THE TOUR ITSELF AND WE WERE

01:52:44.624 --> 01:52:48.461
REAL MAKE THIS HAPPEN SAID EARLY

01:52:48.528 --> 01:52:50.029
ADS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND

01:52:50.096 --> 01:52:51.764
OTHERS REALLY BROUGHT TOGETHER

01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:53.900
SOMETHING THAT HELPED US SEE.

01:52:53.967 --> 01:52:55.802
AND LEARN FROM OTHER STATES.

01:52:55.869 --> 01:52:56.569
IT GIVES A LOT OF FOOD FOR

01:52:56.636 --> 01:52:58.238
THOUGHT SO AS WE LOOK AT

01:52:58.304 --> 01:52:59.372
LEVERAGING QUALITY AND

01:52:59.439 --> 01:53:00.773
ADDRESSING OUTCOMES THERE WERE

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.742
SOME REALLY CORE COMPONENTS THAT

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:04.144
WERE IN ALL THREE OF THE SYSTEMS

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:06.813
WE LOOKED AT SO IN NEW JERSEY

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.948
AND BOSTON AND NEW YORK.

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:10.450
THEY LOOKED IT EXPANDED ACCESS

01:53:10.517 --> 01:53:11.951
THEY AT THE HIGHER TEACHER PAY

01:53:12.018 --> 01:53:13.786
WITH PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT RATES

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:15.388
AND JUST A QUICK NOTE THAT WHEN

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:16.756
WE LOOK AT A CALIFORNIA STATE

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:18.391
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND WE LOOK AT

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:20.093
OUR STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATES.

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:21.361
IT IS LOWER THAN THE REGIONAL

01:53:21.427 --> 01:53:22.762
MARKET RATE AND MANY OF OUR

01:53:22.829 --> 01:53:24.697
COUNTIES AND IS ACTUALLY LOWER

01:53:24.764 --> 01:53:26.699
THAN THAT FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE

01:53:26.766 --> 01:53:28.668
AN IN SAM COUNTIES THE LICENSE

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:31.070
EXEMPT RATE IS THE SAME.

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:32.438
AS OUR STATE PRESCHOOL RIGHT.

01:53:32.505 --> 01:53:34.307
AT THERE ARE ALSO AMPLE TEACHER

01:53:34.374 --> 01:53:35.675
EDUCATION AND TRAINING SUPPORT

01:53:35.742 --> 01:53:38.144
SERVICES AS WELL AS LOOKING AT

01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:40.246
FACILITIES AND REALLY CRAFTING

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:41.714
PROGRAMS THAT FAMILIES AND

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.316
CHILDREN WOULD WANT TO GO INTO.

01:53:43.383 --> 01:53:45.051
SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM'S

01:53:45.118 --> 01:53:46.486
PARTICULARLY STOOD OUT TO US ON

01:53:46.553 --> 01:53:47.387
NOT.

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:49.322
INTENTIONAL INTEGRATION WE WERE

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:51.424
SO IMPRESSED WITH HOW THE IT

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:53.293
INTEGRATED ALL COMPONENTS TO

01:53:53.359 --> 01:53:54.627
ENSURE THAT CHILDREN WERE SERVED

01:53:54.694 --> 01:53:56.196
AND THE HIGHEST QUALITY SETTINGS

01:53:56.262 --> 01:53:57.096
POSSIBLE.

01:53:57.163 --> 01:53:58.731
AND THAT TRANSITIONS TO

01:53:58.798 --> 01:54:00.333
KINDERGARTEN WERE OPTIMIZED AS

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.501
WE LOOKED ACROSS SOME OF THOSE

01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:03.670
PROGRAMS THE USE OF CURRICULUM

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:06.139
FLOWED FROM THE EARLY PRESCHOOL

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:07.607
TO THE OLDER PRIEST CALL AND

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:09.108
THEN UP INTO THE KINDERGARTEN

01:54:09.175 --> 01:54:10.743
PROGRAMS.

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:11.778
WITH REALLY WESTING LESS.

01:54:11.844 --> 01:54:13.179
THE HIGHER EDUCATION COACHING

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:14.881
AND SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT

01:54:14.948 --> 01:54:15.915
SYSTEMS FOR PROFESSIONAL

01:54:15.982 --> 01:54:17.183
DEVELOPMENT.

01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:20.653
THE EXPANSION OF PRESCHOOL IN

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:24.757
EACH OF THESE SYSTEMIC OUT OF

01:54:24.824 --> 01:54:26.159
THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM.

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:28.561
HAVING ROBUST COACHING SYSTEMS

01:54:28.628 --> 01:54:30.930
AND OTHER PIECES TO ENSURE THAT

01:54:30.997 --> 01:54:33.299
THE HIGH QUALITY WAS THERE.

01:54:33.366 --> 01:54:34.500
AND DOCTOR FREEDIA.

01:54:34.567 --> 01:54:36.336
JUST SHARED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:54:36.402 --> 01:54:36.869
PHASING IN THAT BACHELOR'S

01:54:36.936 --> 01:54:39.739
DEGREE PROGRAM AND ASSEMBLY

01:54:39.806 --> 01:54:41.074
MEMBER MCCARTY THAT CHAIR

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:42.175
MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:43.810
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:46.079
ACTUALLY I THINK MOVED US ALL.

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:47.714
WHEN WE HEARD THAT WITH IN NEW

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:49.983
JERSEY AND WITH IN A VERY LOW

01:54:50.049 --> 01:54:51.284
INCOME COMMUNITY?

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:53.286
THAT DE AND RAISING UP A

01:54:53.353 --> 01:54:55.555
BACHELOR'S DEGREES AFFECTED

01:54:55.622 --> 01:54:58.024
MULTI GENERATIONS SO NOT ONLY

01:54:58.091 --> 01:54:59.392
DID IT SUPPORT THE QUALITY OF

01:54:59.459 --> 01:55:00.460
THE TEACHING.

01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:02.262
BUT IT ALSO CREATED ADDITIONAL

01:55:02.328 --> 01:55:03.696
RESPECT FOR THE PRE SCHOOL

01:55:03.763 --> 01:55:05.231
TEACHERS IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:07.467
IT INCREASE THEIR SENSE OF SELF

01:55:07.533 --> 01:55:09.302
WORTH AND VALIDATION AND THE

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:11.471
CHILDREN THEIR CHILDREN ENDED UP

01:55:11.537 --> 01:55:13.406
GOING ON TO ALSO GET DEGREES SO

01:55:13.473 --> 01:55:15.074
THAT WAS THE MULTI GENERAL.

01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:16.643
GENERATIONAL A FAX SO HELPING

01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:18.077
THE CHILDREN IN THE PROGRAM BUT

01:55:18.144 --> 01:55:20.179
ALSO HELPING THOSE FAMILIES IN

01:55:20.246 --> 01:55:21.948
THE WORK FORCE AT THE SAME TIME.

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:24.150
AND JUST A PIECE AROUND PAY

01:55:24.217 --> 01:55:26.486
PARITY THERE THEY STARTED OUT

01:55:26.552 --> 01:55:28.988
INITIALLY WITH PAY PARITY BUT

01:55:29.055 --> 01:55:30.590
LOST SOME OF THAT OVER TIME AND

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:32.025
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE

01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:33.793
INTENTIONAL ABOUT CREATING

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:35.662
SUPPORTS THAT KEEP ADDRESSING

01:55:35.728 --> 01:55:37.730
SOME OF THOSE PAY PARITY ISSUES

01:55:37.797 --> 01:55:38.765
AS YOU MOVE FORWARD.

01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:40.800
WELL WE MAY NOT BE FULLY READY

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:42.568
TO RID OF REQUIRE BA DEGREES FOR

01:55:42.635 --> 01:55:44.470
PRESCHOOL TEACHERS THERE'S A LOT

01:55:44.537 --> 01:55:46.606
AROUND NOT TO THINK OF AROUND

01:55:46.673 --> 01:55:47.874
FOR EXPANDING ACCESS IN

01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:49.142
IMPROVING QUALITY.

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:52.111
AND IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:55:52.178 --> 01:55:53.246
REMEMBER THAT.

01:55:53.313 --> 01:55:57.216
HAD A LOT OF AROUND THEM SO AS

01:55:57.283 --> 01:55:58.785
WE LOOK AT THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS

01:55:58.851 --> 01:56:00.520
AND CREATING EFFICIENCIES.

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:02.255
IT'S NOT JUST INCREASING HIGHER

01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:04.490
AD WHICH IS COR BUT IT'S ALSO

01:56:04.557 --> 01:56:05.992
ENSURING THAT THEIR SUPPORT'S

01:56:06.059 --> 01:56:06.626
FOR THE WORK FORCE TO BE

01:56:06.693 --> 01:56:07.794
SUCCESSFUL.

01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:09.729
IN GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND

01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:10.997
GETTING THEIR DEGREES SAID

01:56:11.064 --> 01:56:12.565
THINGS LIKE COHORTS HAVE BEEN

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:13.766
SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:15.635
PAST WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE GROUPS

01:56:15.702 --> 01:56:17.437
OF TEACHERS EVEN FAMILY CHILD

01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:18.638
CARE PROVIDERS.

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:19.906
GO THROUGH TOGETHER TO GET A

01:56:19.972 --> 01:56:22.108
BACHELOR'S DEGREE WE ALSO HAD

01:56:22.175 --> 01:56:23.810
GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES SO

01:56:23.876 --> 01:56:25.611
THOSE MATH AND ENGLISH COURSES

01:56:25.678 --> 01:56:26.813
THAT TEND TO BE SORT OF THE

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:28.381
STICKING POINT FOR A LOT OF OUR

01:56:28.448 --> 01:56:29.182
WORK FORCE.

01:56:29.248 --> 01:56:30.783
TIED IN LINKED TO CHILD

01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:32.585
DEVELOPMENT COURSE AS WITH OTHER

01:56:32.652 --> 01:56:33.753
SUPPORT SO THAT PEOPLE COULD

01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:35.321
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE AND MAKE IT

01:56:35.388 --> 01:56:36.255
THROUGH THEM.

01:56:36.322 --> 01:56:37.957
AND THEN PROVIDING COACHES TO

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:39.492
TEACHERS THAT'S REALLY

01:56:39.559 --> 01:56:40.593
INTEGRATED WITH AN A

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.261
COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY

01:56:42.328 --> 01:56:44.397
IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM STRESSING IN

01:56:44.464 --> 01:56:46.366
EMPHASIZING THE QUALITY SUPPORTS

01:56:46.432 --> 01:56:47.033
FOR THAT.

01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:48.701
AND THE LAST PART AND THAT IS

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:50.770
THE DRESSING EQUITY WE HAVE TO

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:51.804
ENSURE.

01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:53.373
THAT WE'RE BUILDING CAPACITY

01:56:53.439 --> 01:56:55.341
ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF SETTINGS

01:56:55.408 --> 01:56:57.910
AND SO THE MIX DELIVERY IS THERE

01:56:57.977 --> 01:57:00.413
BUT ALSO ACROSS OUR STATE WE

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.914
KNOW THAT OVER THE YEARS SOME

01:57:01.981 --> 01:57:03.049
AREAS OF OUR STATE HAVE BEEN

01:57:03.116 --> 01:57:04.784
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD MORE WITH

01:57:04.851 --> 01:57:06.185
QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS.

01:57:06.252 --> 01:57:07.887
THAN OTHER AREAS OF OUR STATE

01:57:07.954 --> 01:57:09.522
AND SO ADDITIONAL ENHANCE

01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:11.224
SUPPORTS WE NEED TO HAPPEN TO

01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:15.695
REALLY REYES APP AND SUPPORT THE

01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:16.262
SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT

01:57:16.329 --> 01:57:17.196
BEHIND.

01:57:17.263 --> 01:57:18.398
MOVING ON FROM THE HERITAGE AND

01:57:18.464 --> 01:57:20.366
SUPPORT WOULD BE CURRICULUM AND

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:20.900
MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED IT

01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:22.969
BRIEFLY AND IT WAS REALLY

01:57:23.035 --> 01:57:24.570
TRANSFORMATIVE TO ALL OF US TO

01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:25.238
SEE.

01:57:25.304 --> 01:57:26.773
HOW DEEP AN INTENTIONAL THEY'RE

01:57:26.839 --> 01:57:28.474
FOCUSED ON CURRICULUM AND

01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:30.243
PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:57:30.309 --> 01:57:31.411
TO THE WORK FORCE ON

01:57:31.477 --> 01:57:33.379
IMPLEMENTATION OF CURRICULUM WAS

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:34.480
A PIECE OF THAT?

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:36.115
AND HOW THEY PHASED OUT OVER

01:57:36.182 --> 01:57:37.316
TIME SAID THAT IS YOU'VE GOT

01:57:37.383 --> 01:57:38.684
TEACHERS HAD BEEN IN THE PROGRAM

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:40.520
MORE THEY NEEDED LESS AND LESS

01:57:40.586 --> 01:57:43.389
SUPPORT LESS AND LESS FIDELITY

01:57:43.456 --> 01:57:44.357
TO THE CURRICULUM BECAUSE THEY

01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:45.324
HAD MORE TOOLS IN THERE TOO

01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:45.925
ABOUT.

01:57:45.992 --> 01:57:48.027
BUT NEW TEACHERS NEED A LOT MORE

01:57:48.094 --> 01:57:49.262
SUPPORT AROUND THAT.

01:57:49.328 --> 01:57:50.730
AND THEN MOVING BACK INTO THE

01:57:50.797 --> 01:57:53.699
MIX TO LIVE WE SAW IN THE OTHER

01:57:53.766 --> 01:57:55.601
STATES WAS THAT THEY HAD

01:57:55.668 --> 01:57:57.303
DIFFERENT BLANKS AND FOR

01:57:57.370 --> 01:57:58.571
DIFFERENT PROVIDERS.

01:57:58.638 --> 01:57:59.872
THAT WAS REALLY FASCINATING TO

01:57:59.939 --> 01:58:01.607
SEE WHERE SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL

01:58:01.674 --> 01:58:03.176
BASED PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS CAME

01:58:03.242 --> 01:58:04.644
MEN VERSES THE COMMUNITY BASED

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:07.046
PROGRAM AND ENSURING THAT IN ALL

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:08.614
COMMUNITIES BOTH WERE THERE.

01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:10.116
KNOWING THAT WE DO HAVE WORKING

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:12.185
FAMILIES AND SO A SIX HOUR

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:14.120
PROGRAM IS NOT --

01:58:14.187 --> 01:58:15.655
ACCESSIBLE TO SOME OF OUR

01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:17.223
FAMILIES WHO CANNOT LEAVE WORK

01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:18.324
SAID THE COMMUNITY MADE SURE

01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:19.892
THAT BOTH WERE AVAILABLE FOR

01:58:19.959 --> 01:58:21.294
FAMILIES.

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.895
AND THEN THE REAL TIME DATA THE

01:58:22.962 --> 01:58:24.363
DATA NEEDS TO BE BOTH AT THE

01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:26.132
STATE LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN SAY

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:27.867
MORE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING SO

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:29.435
WE CAN ADDRESS NEEDED INVESTMENT

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:31.337
CHANGES AND LOOK AT EQUITY IN

01:58:31.404 --> 01:58:32.171
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING ACROSS

01:58:32.238 --> 01:58:32.872
THE STATE.

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:34.707
BUT ALSO WITHIN EACH PROGRAM

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:36.242
SAID THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES

01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:37.944
HAVE THAT AND CAN READ THE

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:39.078
REFINED THE CURRICULUM IN THEIR

01:58:39.145 --> 01:58:40.546
SUPPORTS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL

01:58:40.613 --> 01:58:41.547
CHILD.

01:58:41.614 --> 01:58:43.649
SO AS WE START TACKLING THAT IN

01:58:43.716 --> 01:58:45.184
CALIFORNIA WE KNOW WE HAVE TO

01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:47.119
ADDRESS THE CONTINUUM WE KNOW WE

01:58:47.186 --> 01:58:48.654
HAVE TO ALSO IN DRESS AND MOVE

01:58:48.721 --> 01:58:50.289
FORWARD INFANT TODDLER.

01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:52.058
AND NOT LOOKING AT INFANTILE

01:58:52.124 --> 01:58:54.093
THERE WITH MOVING PRESCHOOL ARE

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.229
COMBINED AND I THINK A

01:58:56.295 --> 01:58:57.763
SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN SAD WE

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:59.265
WANT TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THIS I

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:01.334
THINK WE ALL LEFT GOING OKAY WE

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:01.934
CAN DO IT.

01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:03.202
WE'RE GONNA GET THERE WERE

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:04.604
ALREADY PART WAY THERE BUT WE

01:59:04.670 --> 01:59:06.339
WILL ACTUALLY AND MOVE FORWARD

01:59:06.405 --> 01:59:07.640
SO THAT OTHER STATES COME TO

01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:09.942
PASS TO VISIT OUR PROGRAMS.

01:59:10.009 --> 01:59:11.244
AND I THINK OUR POTENTIAL IN

01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:12.678
THAT LEADERSHIP IS REALLY

01:59:12.745 --> 01:59:14.380
ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE MIX

01:59:14.447 --> 01:59:16.649
DELIVERY THAT WE'RE MOVING FOR A

01:59:16.716 --> 01:59:18.584
STRONG PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:19.886
ALSO SUPPORTING INFANTS AND

01:59:19.952 --> 01:59:20.686
TODDLERS.

01:59:20.753 --> 01:59:22.021
THAT WERE INSURING THAT DO A

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:23.856
LANGUAGE LEARNERS ONE OF

01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:25.825

INTEGRATED WITH A BILINGUAL

01:59:27.693 --> 01:59:29.695
PROGRAM AND SUPPORTING CAPACITY

01:59:29.762 --> 01:59:31.497
BUILDING AROUND THAT.

01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:33.533
AND LASTLY ENSURING THAT ALL

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:35.067
CHILDREN CAN PARTICIPATE SAID

01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:36.335
THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE FULL

01:59:36.402 --> 01:59:38.704
INCLUSION AND REALLY SUPPORT

01:59:38.771 --> 01:59:40.406
CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES.

01:59:40.473 --> 01:59:41.507
SAID THAT THE CLASSROOMS AND

01:59:41.574 --> 01:59:47.580
PROGRAMS ARE FOR EVERYONE.

01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:49.048
THAT'S ALL I HAVE.

THE WHEEL AND WHERE WE WOULD BE

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:36.262
BUILDING UPON THAT IF WE STEPPED

02:00:36.329 --> 02:00:38.230
UP SOME LIKE SOME OF THESE OTHER

02:00:38.297 --> 02:00:38.931
STATES THAT.

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:40.433

TO ARE RELATED TO YOUR OUR TRIP

AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE WHAT ARE

02:00:47.273 --> 02:00:49.842
SOME OF THE THE THAT LOGISTICAL

02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:53.479
LESSONS LEARNED AND THE BARRIERS

02:00:53.546 --> 02:00:55.581
IT'S WE COULD APPLY IF WE YOU

02:00:55.648 --> 02:00:58.351
KNOW IT NEW JERSEY THAT THOSE A

02:00:58.417 --> 02:00:58.651
SIX YEAR --

02:00:58.718 --> 02:00:59.652
ROLLOUT.

02:00:59.719 --> 02:01:01.087
IS TALKING ABOUT A THREE AND

02:01:01.153 --> 02:01:01.754
FOUR YEAR OLD LIST LET'S SAY WAS

02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:02.888
A FIVE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION WHAT

02:01:02.955 --> 02:01:04.090
WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT.

02:01:04.156 --> 02:01:06.492
WERE THE AHA THINGS THAT WE THEY

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:10.096
THAT REALLY WHAT WE CAN

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:11.897
REALISTICALLY DO GOING FORWARD.

02:01:11.964 --> 02:01:13.499
ABSOLUTELY SO --

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:14.700
I I DON'T THINK IT'S AS IF

02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:15.434
SURPRISED ANYBODY THERE'S A

02:01:15.501 --> 02:01:16.736
NUMBER OF BILLS MOVING TO THE

02:01:16.802 --> 02:01:18.371
LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE

02:01:18.437 --> 02:01:20.006
IN RESPONSE NOT ONLY TO WHAT WE

02:01:20.072 --> 02:01:21.240
SAW ON THE EAST COAST.

02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:22.975
BUT ALSO MANY THE CONVERSATIONS

02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:24.377
THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS BLUE RIBBON

02:01:24.443 --> 02:01:26.112
COMMISSION HAS BEEN TACKLING

02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:27.279
OVER THIS PAST YEAR THAT IS

02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:28.681
INSPIRED VERY COMPREHENSIVE

02:01:28.748 --> 02:01:29.815
THINKING.

02:01:29.882 --> 02:01:31.217
ABOUT ALL THE DRIVERS OF OUR

02:01:31.283 --> 02:01:33.586
CURRENT PRE CASE SYSTEM AND HOW

02:01:33.653 --> 02:01:35.221
IT ARTICULATES THERE ARE ZERO

02:01:35.287 --> 02:01:36.722
THROUGH AGE TWELVE CHILD CARE

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:37.790
SYSTEM.

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:40.459
AND NUMBER ONE IS THE ADEQUATE

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:42.261
PER CHILD FUNDING ISSUE THE IDEA

02:01:42.328 --> 02:01:43.863
THAT WE HAVE IN AT INADEQUATE

02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:44.997
FUNDING TO EVEN MEET THE

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:47.233
STANDARDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE.

02:01:47.299 --> 02:01:49.335
IS AN UNDERLYING CHALLENGES IT

02:01:49.402 --> 02:01:51.137
DRIVES COMPENSATION FOR OUR WORK

02:01:51.203 --> 02:01:53.139
FORCE AND IT DRIVES THE QUALITY

02:01:53.205 --> 02:01:54.774
OF THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.342
THE CHILDREN ARE IN PERIOD.

02:01:56.409 --> 02:01:57.810
AND SO UNTIL WE CAN TACKLE THAT

02:01:57.877 --> 02:01:59.645
PIECE -- YOU

02:01:59.712 --> 02:02:00.813
THAT THERE IS IT'S IT'S I WOULD

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.481
SAY THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE FIRST

02:02:02.548 --> 02:02:04.316
SEQUENCE STEP WE NEED TO TAKE --

02:02:04.383 --> 02:02:05.618
AND THEN YOU ALSO SEE OTHER

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:06.819
IMPORTANT LEVERS THAT

02:02:06.886 --> 02:02:08.287
ARTICULATED IN THE JANUARY

02:02:08.354 --> 02:02:09.455
BUDGET THAT WE WILL HAVE AN

02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:10.690
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON TOGETHER

02:02:10.756 --> 02:02:13.359
THIS YEAR. TO THINK ABOUT THE

02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:15.428
PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE YOU NEED

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:16.962
TO BUILD THE NEW CLASSROOMS THAT

02:02:17.029 --> 02:02:18.230
YOU NEED IN A MIXED DELIVERY.

02:02:18.297 --> 02:02:23.569
SYSTEM TO LOOK AT THE SUPPORT

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:24.837
CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND THEN

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:26.372
EXPAND --

02:02:26.439 --> 02:02:27.673
WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE AN IMPACTED

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:29.542
TEACHER PIPELINE ACROSS K.

02:02:29.608 --> 02:02:30.076
TWELVE THAT WAS MENTIONED

02:02:30.142 --> 02:02:31.610
EARLIER BY MEMBERS --

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:32.845
SO HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE PRE

02:02:32.912 --> 02:02:34.380
SERVICE PIPELINE THAT MAKES

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:35.915
SENSE IN A SHORT TERM.

02:02:35.981 --> 02:02:37.983
AND LONG TERM AND THEN HOW DO WE

02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:39.852
BUILD OUT ON GOING CONTINUOUS

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:42.254
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS PART

02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:43.689
OF THE PROFESSION.

02:02:43.756 --> 02:02:44.657
QUITE A BIT OF WORK IT'S BEEN

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:46.726
DONE IN THAT AREA IN CALIFORNIA

02:02:46.792 --> 02:02:48.627
WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO IN

02:02:48.694 --> 02:02:50.162
TERMS OF BUILDING CAPACITY --

02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:52.031
AND THEN OF COURSE LAST BUT NOT

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:55.000
LEAST IT'S IT'S THE THE ISSUE OF

02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:56.802
ACCESS IS NOT A UNIVERSAL ISSUE

02:02:56.869 --> 02:02:59.238
ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE AS THE

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:00.539
CHAIRMAN SAYS WE HAVE BEEN

02:03:00.606 --> 02:03:02.575
GETTING STEADILY SO MUCH CLOSER

02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:03.442
TO UNIVERSAL.

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:05.444
ACCESS FOR SOME TYPES OF

02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:07.246
PROGRAMS --

02:03:07.313 --> 02:03:08.514
FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS.

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:09.648
A LOT OF KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO

02:03:09.715 --> 02:03:11.450
PARTY PROGRAMS THAT MAY NOT BE

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:12.618
MEETING THEIR WORKING FAMILIES

02:03:12.685 --> 02:03:14.120
NEEDS WE HAVE TO GET OUR ARMS

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:16.088
AROUND THAT AND NOT ASSUME THAT

02:03:16.155 --> 02:03:17.356
APART DAY SLOT.

02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:19.558
MEANS BOTH THE WORKING FAMILIES

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:20.159
NEED AND THE CHILD'S NEEDS ARE

02:03:20.226 --> 02:03:21.460
BEING MET --

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:22.728
WE HAVE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE

02:03:22.795 --> 02:03:24.163
GREAT CHALLENGES TO EXPANDING

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:26.665
FULL DAY FULL YEAR OR TWO K. AND

02:03:26.732 --> 02:03:28.567
EXPANDED TO KEEP PROGRAMS THOSE

02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:30.336
UNIQUE CHALLENGES NEED TO BE

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:31.837
ADDRESSED SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT.

02:03:31.904 --> 02:03:34.206
THE TWIN MISSION OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:03:34.273 --> 02:03:35.975
PROGRAMS.

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:37.743
I'M JUST GOING OUT A LITTLE BIT

02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:39.011
BECAUSE ERIN CAPTURE THAT SO

02:03:39.078 --> 02:03:40.913
WELL BUT IN AS WE LOOK ABOUT AT

02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:42.615
THAT CAPACITY I THINK.

02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:44.116
I'M TRANSFORMING SOME OF OUR

02:03:44.183 --> 02:03:45.718
HIGHER END COMPONENTS AND

02:03:45.785 --> 02:03:47.219
PROVIDING SUPPORTS FOR THEM SO

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:48.687
THAT MORE OF THE COURSES ARE

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:50.523
PRACTICE BASED SAID THERE REALLY

02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:52.792
TAKING THEORY BUT IT'S FOCUSED

02:03:52.858 --> 02:03:53.993
ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT

02:03:54.059 --> 02:03:54.827
THEORY.

02:03:54.894 --> 02:03:56.362
SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN A

02:03:56.428 --> 02:03:58.998
CLASSROOM THE GROUND WITH

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:01.600
CHILDREN EVERY DAY THAT IS COR

02:04:01.667 --> 02:04:02.835
AND WE SEE A LOT OF TEACHERS

02:04:02.902 --> 02:04:04.470
COMING OUT AND THEY NEED SUPPORT

02:04:04.537 --> 02:04:06.105
ON THE TEACHING COMPONENT.

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:07.473
OF WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING SAID

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:08.974
THAT STRENGTHENING OUT PIECE AND

02:04:09.041 --> 02:04:11.377
THEN FOUR AND JUST THE STATE AS

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:12.845
A WHOLE WE REALLY DO SEE SOME

02:04:12.912 --> 02:04:14.246
EQUITY ISSUES.

02:04:14.313 --> 02:04:15.514
AND WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:17.650
PHASED IN APPROACH ALSO TO HELP

02:04:17.716 --> 02:04:19.618
PROGRAMS APPLY AND MEET THE

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:21.487
STANDARDS OF A HIGH QUALITY

02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:22.454
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM.

02:04:22.521 --> 02:04:24.223
OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST GOING TO

02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:25.958
GET MORE PRESCHOOL IN SOME AREAS

02:04:26.025 --> 02:04:27.693
AND SO REALLY SUPPORTING

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:29.161
ALLOWING TIME FOR ADDITIONAL

02:04:29.228 --> 02:04:30.696
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT

02:04:30.763 --> 02:04:32.565
PEOPLE CAN EVEN APPLY AND

02:04:32.631 --> 02:04:34.099
RESPOND TO APPLICATIONS.

02:04:34.166 --> 02:04:35.868
AND THEN ALSO HAVE THE PROGRAM

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:37.369
AND THE STAFF READY TO IMPLEMENT

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:39.738
AT AND THAT NEEDS ADDITIONAL

02:04:39.805 --> 02:04:41.273
TIME IN SUPPORT AS WELL.

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:44.109
THE FOR LOOP NECKLACES AT LOCAL

02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:49.448
LEVELS WELL [inaudible]

02:04:49.515 --> 02:04:51.283
QUESTIONS.

02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:52.718
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:04:52.785 --> 02:04:54.987
BRING UP OUR FINAL PANEL HERE.

02:04:55.054 --> 02:04:57.590
THIS IS FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE

02:04:57.656 --> 02:04:58.791
WE WANTED TO HAVE A SCHOOL

02:04:58.858 --> 02:05:00.993
DISTRICT --

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:04.430
AS WELL AS A NON PROFITS.

02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:06.065
EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDER THAT

02:05:06.131 --> 02:05:07.733
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:11.570
A CONTRACTOR PROVIDE AS A

02:05:11.637 --> 02:05:12.137
PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IT WOULD

02:05:12.204 --> 02:05:13.973
TAKE.

02:05:14.039 --> 02:05:15.474
FOR FROM COMMUNITIES ACROSS

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:16.809
CALIFORNIA.

02:05:16.876 --> 02:05:25.284
TO STEP IT UP.

02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:26.785
NOT A PROBLEM I WAS A SAY ONE OF

02:05:26.852 --> 02:05:27.419
THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME AM I

02:05:27.486 --> 02:05:28.988
MISSING ONE OF THE THINGS FROM

02:05:29.054 --> 02:05:30.589
THE EARLY LEARNING THAT I REALLY

02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:32.958
PICKED UP ON WAS THAT IN.

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:34.360
WHEN WE WERE IN NEW JERSEY THEY

02:05:34.426 --> 02:05:36.462
HAD AT OUTDOOR PLAYGROUND?

02:05:36.528 --> 02:05:37.162
AND THERE WERE TWO YEAR OLDS AND

02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:39.231
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THIRTY DEGREES

02:05:39.298 --> 02:05:40.966
OUTSIDE.

02:05:41.033 --> 02:05:42.568
THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:45.404
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:05:45.471 --> 02:05:48.073
I TELL YOU HOW MANY PHONE CALLS.

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:48.974
FROM PARENTS WHEN IT'S SIXTY

02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:50.442
DEGREES OUTSIDE IN THE KIDS ARE

02:05:50.509 --> 02:05:52.811
GOING OUTSIDE SO I THINK ONE OF

02:05:52.878 --> 02:05:53.512
THE LEARNING.

02:05:53.579 --> 02:05:56.882
MAN THOSE KIDS HAVE SOME GREAT

02:05:56.949 --> 02:05:58.217
TO GET OUT THERE WHAT.

02:05:58.284 --> 02:06:00.519
TIME RIGHT YEAH TODDLERS YET AND

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:02.454
THEY WERE CRAWLING ON THE GROUND

02:06:02.521 --> 02:06:05.057
THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING THAT.

02:06:05.124 --> 02:06:07.893
YOU WOULD DO US ANY DAY --

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:08.827
I'M GONNA SAY.

02:06:08.894 --> 02:06:10.262
I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO GO

02:06:10.329 --> 02:06:11.363
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS IS.

02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:12.865
BEING FROM A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS

02:06:12.932 --> 02:06:13.699
TO SEE WHAT OTHER STATES ARE

02:06:13.766 --> 02:06:15.567
DOING SEE WHAT OTHER AND LARGER

02:06:15.634 --> 02:06:16.802
DISTRICTS.

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:17.503
AND SO FOR ME WAS REALLY

02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:20.205
INTERESTING TO TO IN NEW YORK

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:24.510
BECAUSE WE HAVE TWENTY ONE

02:06:24.576 --> 02:06:25.644
THOUSAND KIDS IN OUR PROGRAM BUT

02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:28.981
THEY MANAGE TO LIFT FROM EIGHT

02:06:29.048 --> 02:06:29.615
THOUSAND EIGHTY THOUSAND IN THE

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:29.815
YEAR.

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:31.784
SO I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS

02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:33.519
THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT WAS.

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:37.957
JUST THE AMOUNT OF AMNESTY INTER

02:06:38.023 --> 02:06:40.492
AGENCY COLLABORATION THAT NEEDS

02:06:40.559 --> 02:06:41.660
TO TAKE PLACE TO GET SOMETHING

02:06:41.727 --> 02:06:42.761
LIKE THAT TIME.

02:06:42.828 --> 02:06:44.096
AND THE WAY THEY DID IT WITH

02:06:44.163 --> 02:06:45.564
INCLUDING EVERYTHING FROM THAT

02:06:45.631 --> 02:06:48.500
FIRE DEPARTMENT TO LICENSING TO

02:06:48.567 --> 02:06:49.535
THEIR DEPARTMENT OF ADD

02:06:49.601 --> 02:06:50.636
PROVIDING.

02:06:50.703 --> 02:06:52.171
YOU KNOW OVER THREE HUNDRED

02:06:52.237 --> 02:06:53.639
DIFFERENT KINDS OF TECHNICAL

02:06:53.706 --> 02:06:55.507
ASSISTANCE YOU KNOW I'M.

02:06:55.574 --> 02:06:57.443
WHICH JUST TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:59.445
THE CURRICULUM THAT WAS CREATED

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:02.214
ALONG WITH I JUST THINK THAT THE

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:03.949
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT OF THAT.

02:07:04.016 --> 02:07:05.951
WAS PRETTY AMAZING TO ME I'M

02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:07.653
GONNA SAY THE OTHER THING THAT I

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.388
TOOK AWAY FROM THAT WAS THAT.

02:07:09.455 --> 02:07:10.289
WE HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD

02:07:10.356 --> 02:07:12.291
OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA I

02:07:12.358 --> 02:07:13.492
THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF AGENCIES

02:07:13.559 --> 02:07:15.227
WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WANT

02:07:15.294 --> 02:07:16.028
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:17.930
AND ABOUT INVESTING IN OUR WORK

02:07:17.997 --> 02:07:19.198
FORCE I THINK THERE'S FOLKS THAT

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:20.532
WANT TO DO THAT THAT REALLY SEE

02:07:20.599 --> 02:07:21.867
THE IMPORTANCE AND I CAN SPEAK

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:23.802
FROM A KIND OF A LOCAL

02:07:23.869 --> 02:07:25.704
PERSPECTIVE IN THAT.

02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:27.606
I THINK BEING INNOVATIVE AND

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:28.741
WITH THE FUNDS THAT WE'VE HAD

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:30.709
YOU KNOW IN LA UNIFIED WAS USING

02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:33.479
TITLE TO FUNDS. TO SUPPORT OUR

02:07:33.545 --> 02:07:35.614
TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:37.249
PROBABLY SPENT ABOUT A HALF A

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:39.385
MILLION DOLLARS ON TEACHER PD

02:07:39.451 --> 02:07:40.819
BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING IN

02:07:40.886 --> 02:07:42.554
OVER.

02:07:42.621 --> 02:07:43.022
THREE HUNDRED TEACHER

02:07:43.088 --> 02:07:44.990
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SO

02:07:45.057 --> 02:07:46.492
I THINK THAT'S A BIG PIECE.

02:07:46.558 --> 02:07:48.193
AND FRESH TOHAVE IN OUR SCHOOL

02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:49.828
BOARD AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR

02:07:49.895 --> 02:07:51.063
LEADERSHIP ON BOARD.

02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:52.297
BEING ABLE TO INCLUDE EARLY

02:07:52.364 --> 02:07:54.066
EDUCATION AS PART OF THEIR AL

02:07:54.133 --> 02:07:55.401
CFS.

02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:56.802
WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT KIND

02:07:56.869 --> 02:07:59.138
OF LEVERAGE DOLLARS IN FINES TO

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:00.606
MAKE SURE THAT EARLY EDUCATION

02:08:00.672 --> 02:08:01.640
STATE AND FRANK.

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:03.242
I AM AND THAT WE WERE ALSO BEING

02:08:03.308 --> 02:08:04.777
MONITORED AND LOOKED AT AS FAR

02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:07.046
AS ALL OF OUR CENTERS

02:08:07.112 --> 02:08:08.280
PARTICIPATED IN THE QUALITY

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:10.015
RATING IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEM AND

02:08:10.082 --> 02:08:11.750
AND I'M NOT SURE KIND OF BLEAK

02:08:11.817 --> 02:08:13.085
NUMBERS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

02:08:13.152 --> 02:08:14.686
IN OUR INITIAL RATINGS WE HAD

02:08:14.753 --> 02:08:17.423
SIXTIES IN ON A RATING OF ONE TO

02:08:17.489 --> 02:08:19.858
FIVE WE HAD SIXTY SEVEN SCHOOLS

02:08:19.925 --> 02:08:21.226
THAT WERE RATED AS A TWO MAY

02:08:21.293 --> 02:08:22.127
TWELFTH SCHOOLS THAT WERE RATED

02:08:22.194 --> 02:08:24.363
AS A THREE AND TWO SCHOOLS THAT

02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:26.165
WERE RATED AS A FOUR BUT ONCE

02:08:26.231 --> 02:08:27.132
THE BOARD KIND OF GOT.

02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:28.233
ON BOARD AND REALLY STARTED

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.369
PUSHING EARLY EDUCATION STARTED

02:08:30.436 --> 02:08:31.670
MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS.

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:33.172
AND WE BOUGHT AN ADDITIONAL

02:08:33.238 --> 02:08:35.374
COACHING THROUGH AND AT AT THE

02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:37.976
TIME IT WAS ALLEY AT BUT CHILD.

02:08:38.043 --> 02:08:39.344
THREE SIXTY IN OUR LAST ROUND OF

02:08:39.411 --> 02:08:41.580
SCORES WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL AT A

02:08:41.647 --> 02:08:44.049
TWO WE HAVE FORTY THREE AT A

02:08:44.116 --> 02:08:48.087
THREE AND THIRTY NINE OR THIRTY

02:08:48.153 --> 02:08:49.822
DOING THAT KIND OF WORK REALLY

02:08:49.888 --> 02:08:51.390
DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THEN

02:08:51.457 --> 02:08:52.624
I THINK THE OTHER PART OF IT

02:08:52.691 --> 02:08:54.193
THAT KIND OF MAKES WST KINDA

02:08:54.259 --> 02:08:55.861
UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT.

02:08:55.928 --> 02:08:57.596
WE DO PARA TEACHERS A LIVABLE

02:08:57.663 --> 02:08:59.098
WAGE IN EARLY EDUCATION PART OF

02:08:59.164 --> 02:09:00.532
IT IS BECAUSE THEY'RE PART OF

02:09:00.599 --> 02:09:01.667
THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT

02:09:01.733 --> 02:09:02.835
WITH YOU TLA.

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:04.937
SO WHATEVER HAPPENS THERE AS FAR

02:09:05.003 --> 02:09:06.605
AS BENEFITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

02:09:06.672 --> 02:09:08.140
ALSO BEEN OF OUR BENEFIT OUR

02:09:08.207 --> 02:09:08.974
TEACHERS.

02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:12.377
SO TEACHER IN LA UNIFIED

02:09:12.444 --> 02:09:14.580
BENEFITS AFTER FIVE YEARS WOULD

02:09:14.646 --> 02:09:16.415
MAKE AROUND SEVENTY THOUSAND

02:09:16.482 --> 02:09:17.449
DOLLARS SO THAT'S A BIG

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:19.218
DIFFERENCE COMPARED.

02:09:19.284 --> 02:09:20.152
TO A LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:21.653
ARE OUT THERE.

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.288
AND I THINK OTHER THINGS THAT

02:09:23.355 --> 02:09:24.656
REALLY MAKE US UNIQUE AND REALLY

02:09:24.723 --> 02:09:25.791
KIND OF MOVING IN THE RIGHT

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:27.259
DIRECTION SOMEBODY HAD MENTIONED

02:09:27.326 --> 02:09:28.494
ABOUT.

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:30.129
IS THE EARLY AT CENTER PLACE

02:09:30.195 --> 02:09:30.796
WHERE PARENTS WANT TO PUT THEIR

02:09:30.863 --> 02:09:31.797
KIDS.

02:09:31.864 --> 02:09:32.898
WE'VE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY

02:09:32.965 --> 02:09:35.400
INTO OUR INTO OUR WIRELESS

02:09:35.467 --> 02:09:36.802
INTERNET AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:09:36.869 --> 02:09:39.071
AHMED ABOUT TWENTY POINT ONE

02:09:39.138 --> 02:09:39.872
MILLION DOLLARS USING BOND

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:40.606
FINDING.

02:09:40.672 --> 02:09:41.507
THAT WE'VE AND WE STARTED

02:09:41.573 --> 02:09:42.841
CREATING OUR FIRST WE HAVE OUR

02:09:42.908 --> 02:09:45.043
FIRST SEVEN STEAM CERTIFIED

02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:47.112
EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS.

02:09:47.179 --> 02:09:49.014
WE HAVE TEN OUTDOOR NATURE

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:50.682
EXPORTS CERTIFYING CLASSROOMS

02:09:50.749 --> 02:09:51.517
AND WE HAVE THIRTEEN DUAL

02:09:51.583 --> 02:09:52.885
LANGUAGE PROGRAMS IN EARLY

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:53.852
EDUCATION.

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:57.089
SO I THINK THOSE THINGS ALSO

02:09:57.156 --> 02:09:59.391
SPEAK WELL OF I'M GONNA SAY THAT

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:00.225
DISTRICTS SUPPORT AND THE

02:10:00.292 --> 02:10:00.559
BACKING OF IT.

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:01.927
SO.

02:10:01.994 --> 02:10:03.595
I THINK THE LONG TERM ISSUE AND

02:10:03.662 --> 02:10:05.063
WHAT WE'VE HAD TO CHANGE THE

02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:06.732
CONVERSATION AROUND AND THIS IS

02:10:06.798 --> 02:10:08.267
KIND OF AT ALL LEVELS IS REALLY

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:09.168
MAKING.

02:10:09.234 --> 02:10:10.569
EARLY EDUCATION SEEN AS AN

02:10:10.636 --> 02:10:12.371
INVESTMENT.

02:10:12.437 --> 02:10:13.906
AND NOT AN ENCROACHMENT.

02:10:13.972 --> 02:10:15.274
YOU KNOW FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:16.909
TALK ABOUT EARLY EDUCATION IS AN

02:10:16.975 --> 02:10:18.010
ENCROACHMENT.

02:10:18.076 --> 02:10:19.178
IT REALLY LENDS ITSELF TO BEING

02:10:19.244 --> 02:10:21.079
CUT.

02:10:21.146 --> 02:10:22.080
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AND AS AN

02:10:22.147 --> 02:10:24.883
INVESTMENT AND WE COSTED OUT IF

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:26.385
96% OF THOSE KIDS THAT WE HAVE

02:10:26.451 --> 02:10:28.820
AN EARLY EDUCATION STAY WITH US

02:10:28.887 --> 02:10:30.222
TO FIRST GRADE?

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:32.424
THEN WE RECOUP ALL THE COST PLUS

02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:35.127
ON IN EIGHTY A SO AS A DISTRICT

02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:37.196
THAT ENROLLMENT PIECES BEEN VERY

02:10:37.262 --> 02:10:37.829
SIGNIFICANT SO.

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:40.199
I AM.

02:10:40.265 --> 02:10:42.601
BUT I DO THINK GOING BACK TO

02:10:42.668 --> 02:10:44.603
WHEN DOCTOR FREE SAID IS THAT

02:10:44.670 --> 02:10:46.672
REALLY LOOKING LONG TERM AND HOW

02:10:46.738 --> 02:10:48.407
DO WE GET A QUICK MARK.

02:10:48.473 --> 02:10:50.542
QUALIFIED WORKFORCE AND WITH

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:52.678
KATE GETTING A BA IN NEW JERSEY

02:10:52.744 --> 02:10:54.379
WHEN THE TEACHERS TALKED ABOUT

02:10:54.446 --> 02:10:55.981
WHAT THAT MEANT FOR THEM AND YOU

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:57.349
KNOW AND I'M GONNA SAY.

02:10:57.416 --> 02:10:59.051
THEY WERE VERY PROUD OF IT I

02:10:59.117 --> 02:11:00.719
THINK THAT WOULD ALSO SPEAK TO

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:01.987
OUR PARENTS AND THEN IT WAS ALSO

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:03.255
THE PEACE THAT ONE OF THE

02:11:03.322 --> 02:11:04.590
TEACHERS SAID THAT.

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:05.357
IT WASN'T JUST GETTING HER

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:07.259
BACHELOR'S DEGREE IT WAS BEING

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:09.261
ABLE TO TELL HER PARENTS OF HER

02:11:09.328 --> 02:11:11.096
KIDS WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET

02:11:11.163 --> 02:11:13.465
A BACHELOR'S DEGREE.

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:15.300
I THINK THOSE KINDS OF

02:11:15.367 --> 02:11:16.501
STATEMENTS AND PROGRAMS IN

02:11:16.568 --> 02:11:18.837
BELIEVES BY THE TEACHERS ALSO

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:20.772
MAKE A LONG TERM DIFFERENCE SO.

02:11:20.839 --> 02:11:22.040
AM I MISS IT SO THOSE ARE

02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:23.842
CONSENT KIND OF SOME OF MY TAKE

02:11:23.909 --> 02:11:25.611
AWAYS AND SOME OF THE THINGS

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:27.713
THAT WERE KIND OF DOING IN LA U.

02:11:27.779 --> 02:11:29.581
S. T. TO KIND OF MAKE AN TO MAKE

02:11:29.648 --> 02:11:31.250
A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR OUR KIDS.

02:11:31.316 --> 02:11:34.620

WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE OF THE

STATE --

02:12:21.566 --> 02:12:23.802
POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS

THAT ARE MADE HERE AND HUMAN YOU

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:27.773

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:30.208
WHAT'S BEEN SAID EARLIER WE

02:12:30.275 --> 02:12:31.610
POINT SEVEN BILLION A YEAR WE

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:32.911
SIR FOREIGN SEVENTY THOUSAND

02:12:32.978 --> 02:12:35.580
CHILDREN --

02:12:35.647 --> 02:12:37.482
AND YET NONE OF THE PROGRAMS

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:40.018
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW --

02:12:40.085 --> 02:12:40.652
OF ALL OF THEM AND WE HAVE A LOT

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:43.055
OF THEM MEET THE STANDARDS THAT

02:12:43.121 --> 02:12:45.390
RESEARCH SHOWS ACTUALLY RESULTS

02:12:45.457 --> 02:12:48.860
IN LONGITUDINAL GAINS FOR FOR ME

02:12:48.927 --> 02:12:49.027
NOW.

02:12:49.094 --> 02:12:50.329
CHILDREN --

02:12:50.395 --> 02:12:51.396
WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT

ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OR YOU KNOW

02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:58.003
IMPROVEMENTS OF LATER IN LIFE.

02:12:58.070 --> 02:13:01.139
AND YOU KNOW THERE THERE WASN'T --

02:13:01.206 --> 02:13:03.875
ANY COST BENEFIT DATA IT'S COME

02:13:03.942 --> 02:13:04.910
OUT OF NEW JERSEY BUT WE

02:13:04.976 --> 02:13:06.411
CERTAINLY EFFORT KLEINIAN YOU

02:13:06.478 --> 02:13:07.813
REFERENCED --

02:13:07.879 --> 02:13:09.514
NOBEL LAUREATE JAMES HECKMAN AND

02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:10.982
HE OFTEN SAYS YOU KNOW FOR EVERY

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:12.951
DOLLAR YOU INVEST YOU GET SEVEN

02:13:13.018 --> 02:13:14.152

CONFERENCES ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

02:13:17.322 --> 02:13:18.957
VERACITY OF THAT I THINKING IN

02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:20.225
TODAY'S DAY AND AGE OF A NOBEL

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:21.927
LAUREATE SAYS THAT WE JUST SAY

02:13:21.993 --> 02:13:23.362

02:13:23.428 --> 02:13:24.496
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME BUT YOU

02:13:24.563 --> 02:13:26.231
KNOW THE MATH ON THAT IF YOU

02:13:26.298 --> 02:13:27.999
LOOK AT FIVE BILLION --

02:13:28.066 --> 02:13:30.335
IS YOU KNOW AT THIRTY FIVE

02:13:30.402 --> 02:13:32.270
BILLION BACK AND BENEFITS --

02:13:32.337 --> 02:13:34.172
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU'RE TO

02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:36.375
TAKE SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS AND

02:13:36.441 --> 02:13:37.876
INCREASE THEM TO THE LEVEL.

02:13:37.943 --> 02:13:40.545
OF STANDARDS AND QUALITY I

02:13:40.612 --> 02:13:42.914
INVEST IN THEM OF MONEY RIGHT

02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:44.683
HAAS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET PAID

02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:45.350
MORE.

02:13:45.417 --> 02:13:46.885
ON THE BENEFITS BACK WOULD BE

02:13:46.952 --> 02:13:51.723
HUGE THE WE HAVE VERY FEW

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:54.926
RESEARCH ON OUR PROGRAMS --

02:13:54.993 --> 02:13:55.794
ONE STUDY THAT WAS ALREADY

02:13:55.861 --> 02:13:58.230
ALLUDED TO IS THE OUR STUDY --

02:13:58.296 --> 02:14:00.031
THAT LOOKED AT TI QUE IN

02:14:00.098 --> 02:14:01.099
PRESCHOOL --

02:14:01.166 --> 02:14:03.168
AND YOU KNOW THE RESULT WAS YET

02:14:03.235 --> 02:14:04.436
THE KIDS THAT WERE IN TWO K. IT

02:14:04.503 --> 02:14:05.971
LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:07.606
KIDS THAT WERE IN PRESCHOOL --

02:14:07.672 --> 02:14:09.875
BUT THE REALITY IS IS THAT.

02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:11.643
NEITHER OF THEM ARE CLOSING THE

02:14:11.710 --> 02:14:12.711
GAP --

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:13.912
NEITHER OF THEM ARE CLOSING THE

02:14:13.979 --> 02:14:15.781
GAP IN THE WAY THAT --

02:14:15.847 --> 02:14:17.883
WE SEE SOME OF THESE OTHER

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:19.518
STATES AND CITIES DOING --

02:14:19.584 --> 02:14:23.054
SO I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW.

02:14:23.121 --> 02:14:24.723
FANTASTIC THAT A GROUP WENT AND

02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:26.158
VISITED THESE OTHER PROGRAMS AND

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:27.959
I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:29.528
TO THEM --

02:14:29.594 --> 02:14:32.297
AS AS YOU KNOW NORTH STARS OF

02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:34.232
WHERE WE NEED TO BE HEADED LONG

02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:36.268
TERM ALMOND WITH THOUGHTFUL

02:14:36.334 --> 02:14:41.006
PLANNING AND INVESTMENT.

02:14:41.072 --> 02:14:41.773
IN.

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:43.041
THE SAN JOSE.

02:14:57.756 --> 02:14:59.357
COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT A PLANNING

02:14:59.424 --> 02:15:01.059
EFFORT AROUND HOW DO WE GET

02:15:01.126 --> 02:15:01.993
CHILDREN --

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:03.428
AS MANY CHILDREN AS WE CAN TO

02:15:03.495 --> 02:15:06.164
PROFICIENCY BY BY THIRD GRADE

BOTH IN LANGUAGE AND MATH --

02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:10.702
AND WE LOOKED AT ONE MAJOR --

02:15:10.769 --> 02:15:12.304
CORNERSTONE OF THAT IS CREATING

02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:13.705
PRESCHOOL FOR ALL --

02:15:13.772 --> 02:15:16.174

HAVE THE COUNTY OFFICE AND WE

02:15:17.576 --> 02:15:18.743
HAD COMMUNITY BASED

ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CUTTING GO WE

02:15:21.246 --> 02:15:22.514
ALL CAME AROUND THE TABLE.

02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:25.283
HIGH AND THE DISTRICTS THAT YOU

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:27.085

02:15:27.152 --> 02:15:28.453
ON A COUNTY OFFICE THAT WE WANT

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:29.654

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:31.723
STATE PRESCHOOL WOULD LIKE TO

02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:33.058
EXPAND EARLY HEAD START AND

02:15:33.124 --> 02:15:35.994
INSTEAD OF FIGHTING OVER WHO

02:15:36.061 --> 02:15:37.996
GETS THE FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE WHO

02:15:38.063 --> 02:15:40.432

YOU KNOW WE SAID OKAY IT'S CAN

02:15:43.635 --> 02:15:44.870

THE SERVE MORE THREE YEAR OLDS

02:15:46.204 --> 02:15:47.706
HOW DO WE BRING IN MORE INFANTS

02:15:49.241 --> 02:15:50.909
FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT

02:15:50.976 --> 02:15:53.111
AND WE PLAN TOGETHER BECAUSE IF

02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:53.712
WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET TO A

02:15:53.778 --> 02:15:54.613
PLACE.

02:15:54.679 --> 02:15:56.047
WHERE WE ACTUALLY ARE SERVING

02:15:56.114 --> 02:15:58.383
MORE LOW INCOME THREES AND MORE

02:15:58.450 --> 02:15:59.684
LONG COME INFANTS AND TODDLERS

02:15:59.751 --> 02:16:01.186
WITH SOMEONE'S GOT TO DO THAT?

02:16:01.253 --> 02:16:04.256
RIGHT AND OFTEN TIMES --

02:16:04.322 --> 02:16:05.790
THOSE ARE THE CBO'S.

02:16:05.857 --> 02:16:07.025
ARE THE COMMUNITY BASED

02:16:07.092 --> 02:16:09.294
ORGANIZATIONS THAT --

02:16:09.361 --> 02:16:11.730
ARE THE EXPERTS IN IT AND AND

02:16:11.796 --> 02:16:13.331
CAPABLE OF DOING IT --

02:16:13.398 --> 02:16:15.567
SO WE BROUGHT ALL OF US TOGETHER

02:16:15.634 --> 02:16:16.735
AND WE DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT

02:16:16.801 --> 02:16:18.003
WHO SERVES WHICH KIDS BUT HOW DO

02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:19.738
WE SERVE THOSE KIDS AND WE HAVE

02:16:19.804 --> 02:16:21.172
A HIGH POPULATION.

02:16:21.239 --> 02:16:23.441
OF DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS ON A

02:16:23.508 --> 02:16:24.743
IN THE SAN JOSE --

02:16:24.809 --> 02:16:26.444
SO WE WORKED WITH THE SCHOOL

02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:28.146
DISTRICT AROUND OKAY I YOU HAVE

02:16:28.213 --> 02:16:29.347
SOME TO A LANGUAGE IMMERSION

02:16:29.414 --> 02:16:30.649
SCHOOLS WELL LET'S MAKE SURE

02:16:30.715 --> 02:16:31.917
THAT THE PRESCHOOLS ON THOSE

02:16:31.983 --> 02:16:34.352
CAMPUSES ARE ALIGNED TO THAT

02:16:34.419 --> 02:16:35.687
CURRICULUM --

02:16:35.754 --> 02:16:39.224
YOU KNOW WE WE HAD A LOT OF

02:16:39.291 --> 02:16:42.527
CASES OF TRAUMA --

02:16:42.594 --> 02:16:44.129
WHERE WE ALL SAID WE PORTS A

02:16:44.195 --> 02:16:47.232
MENTAL AND SO WE CREATED A MODEL

02:16:47.299 --> 02:16:49.935
AROUND THAT --

02:16:50.001 --> 02:16:52.404
CAN FOR US WHAT REALLY --

02:16:52.470 --> 02:16:54.940
MADE THE BIGGEST IMPACT --

02:16:55.006 --> 02:16:56.074
AND AND AND SPEAKING

02:16:56.141 --> 02:16:57.709
PARTICULARLY IF COULD BANGO IS.

02:16:57.776 --> 02:16:59.477
OF A CONTINUOUS QUALITY

02:16:59.544 --> 02:17:01.446
IMPROVEMENT APPROACH --

02:17:01.513 --> 02:17:03.014
WHERE WE FIRST STARTED IN THIS

02:17:03.081 --> 02:17:04.382
IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND LANGUAGE

02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:06.084
DEVELOPMENT WE LOOKED AT ONE OF

02:17:06.151 --> 02:17:08.453
THE MOST PREDICTED SKILLS --

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:10.055
THAT -- SHOW

02:17:10.121 --> 02:17:12.424
THAT IF CHILDREN ARE MEETING

02:17:12.490 --> 02:17:14.459
CERTAIN LEVELS OF PROFICIENCY IN

02:17:14.526 --> 02:17:15.994
VOCABULARY AND SOUNDS AND

02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:18.997
LETTERS AND RHYMING ALLITERATION --

02:17:19.064 --> 02:17:20.699
BY THE TIME THEY START

02:17:20.765 --> 02:17:22.801
KINDERGARTEN THAT IT'S THE BEST

02:17:22.867 --> 02:17:24.169
CHANCE THAT THEY HAVE FOR

02:17:24.235 --> 02:17:26.004
READING BY THE END OF THIRD

02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:27.305
GRADE --

02:17:27.372 --> 02:17:28.840
THEN WE LOOKED AT THAT WE LOOKED

02:17:28.907 --> 02:17:30.508
AT SOME EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULA

02:17:30.575 --> 02:17:32.143
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPART THOSE

02:17:32.210 --> 02:17:33.545
SKILLS --

02:17:33.612 --> 02:17:34.779
AND THEN WE STARTED WORKING WITH

02:17:34.846 --> 02:17:37.082
OUR TEACHERS AND WE STARTED TO

02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:38.383
INVEST IN THEM ME AND NOT THIS

02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:39.551
IS REALLY ALL ABOUT WHETHER

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:41.186
YOU'RE INCREASING THEIR SALARIES

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:42.787
ARE INVESTING IN THEIR

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.756
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT --

02:17:44.823 --> 02:17:46.958
IN OVER A NINE MONTH PERIOD WE

02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:49.628
WE TRAIN THEM IN THIS CURRICULUM --

02:17:49.694 --> 02:17:52.130
BUT WE AS WE KNOW THAT'S NOT

02:17:52.197 --> 02:17:55.467
ENOUGH TO JUST MONTH --

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:57.569
SO THAT EVERY TIME THEY WENT

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:58.603
BACK TO THEIR CLASSROOMS THEY

02:17:58.670 --> 02:18:00.372
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE

02:18:00.438 --> 02:18:02.040
THEIR PRACTICE REFLECT ON IT AND

02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:02.741
THEN.

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:03.908
THEY WOULD COME BACK THE NEXT

02:18:03.975 --> 02:18:05.710
MONTH FOR TRAINING.

02:18:05.777 --> 02:18:06.578
AND THEN THREE TIMES A YEAR WE

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:08.713
LOOK AT DATA THAT SHOWED HOW

02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:10.815
CHILDREN WERE PROGRESSING SO

02:18:10.882 --> 02:18:12.283
THAT INFORM THE INSTRUCTION --

02:18:12.350 --> 02:18:14.319
AND IN FRANKLY WAS A GREAT

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:16.321
MOTIVATOR FOR OUR OUR TEACHERS

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:18.356
FROM FRANKLY FOR EVERYONE THE

02:18:18.423 --> 02:18:19.658
ENTIRE ORGANIZATION.

02:18:19.724 --> 02:18:21.459
ON AND FOR PARENTS AND A AND

02:18:21.526 --> 02:18:22.594
THEN EVENTUALLY AS THE CHILDREN

02:18:22.661 --> 02:18:23.528
ON THE KINDERGARTEN FOR THOSE

02:18:23.595 --> 02:18:24.663
KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS TWO X.

02:18:24.729 --> 02:18:26.731
EXCITED TO SEE.

02:18:26.798 --> 02:18:29.434
HOW MUCH BETTER PREPARED --

02:18:29.501 --> 02:18:30.935
THESE CHILDREN WERE.

02:18:31.002 --> 02:18:32.203
SO YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST AN

02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:33.805
EXAMPLE.

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:35.774
OF HOW LOCAL AFRICAN COME

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:37.308

REALLY LOOK AT EXPANDING ACCESS --

02:18:42.247 --> 02:18:44.516
IN HIGH QUALITY ACCESS. FOR OUR

02:18:44.582 --> 02:18:47.619
CHILDREN THAT NEED IT THE MOST --

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:49.421
BUT I THINK WHETHER IT'S LOCAL.

02:18:49.487 --> 02:18:50.422
OR STATE WIDE THIS IS THE

02:18:50.488 --> 02:18:54.059

TIME TO BE AN EARLY EDUCATION

02:19:55.453 --> 02:19:57.388
TEACHER SINCE THAT TIME THOUGH

OUR TEACHERS HAVE A BACHELOR'S

02:19:59.324 --> 02:19:59.791
DEGREE.

02:19:59.858 --> 02:20:00.558

SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AS FAR AS

TEACHERS.

02:20:24.616 --> 02:20:25.717

THEM TO TAKE OFF IN THE MIDDLE

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:38.563

02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:46.871
AND WE ALLOWED THEM TO GET THEIR

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:48.840
PROFESSIONAL GROWTH HOURS AND

02:20:48.907 --> 02:20:50.408
FOR EACH U. K. ANTI K. TEACHERS

02:20:50.475 --> 02:20:51.643
WE USE SOME OF OUR TITLE TO

02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:52.610
FINDING.

02:20:52.677 --> 02:20:54.078
TO PAY THEM --

PUT YOU ON A PATH TO GETTING

YOUR BE A AND WE CREATED A

02:21:40.024 --> 02:21:43.161
PROGRAM WHERE WE WILL PAY UP TO

02:21:43.228 --> 02:21:44.095
FIFTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR

02:21:44.162 --> 02:21:45.530
FOR ANY OF OUR TEACHERS TO GO

02:21:45.597 --> 02:21:46.898
BACK TO SCHOOL AND CONTINUE

02:21:46.965 --> 02:21:48.533
THEIR EDUCATION --

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:49.801
AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO EARN A

02:21:49.868 --> 02:21:51.903
HIGHER WAGE I WILL SAY I MEAN I

02:21:51.970 --> 02:21:53.037
CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH.

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:54.739
ARE THE INCREASES THAT WE'VE HAD

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:57.709
IN THE YOU KNOW STYLE FIVE RATES --

02:21:57.775 --> 02:21:59.644
OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAVE

02:21:59.711 --> 02:22:01.579
BEEN MONUMENTAL YOU KNOW WE HAVE

02:22:01.646 --> 02:22:03.414
BEEN ABLE TO RAISE OUR TEACHER

SALARIES.

02:22:04.749 --> 02:22:06.551
BY 45% IN THE LAST THREE AND A

02:22:06.618 --> 02:22:07.719
HALF YEARS AND THAT'S YOU KNOW

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:09.821
MAINLY DUE BECAUSE OF THE

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:11.289
INCREASES IN RIGHT SO --

02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:12.657
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT ENOUGH

02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:14.392
AND WE CERTAINLY NEED MORE BUT

02:22:14.459 --> 02:22:16.694
IT'S BEEN A HUGE HUGE HELP OUR

02:22:16.761 --> 02:22:18.363
MINIMUM WAGE IS GONE FROM ELEVEN

02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:19.764
DOLLARS AN HOUR TO SIXTEEN

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:21.399
DOLLARS AN HOUR --

02:22:21.466 --> 02:22:22.567
SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR STILL

02:22:22.634 --> 02:22:25.503
NOT ENOUGH BUT WORST INCREDIBLY

02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:28.873
GRATEFUL --

02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:29.507
TO BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE IT FROM

02:22:29.574 --> 02:22:31.175
THE CAN I ADD ONE THING ONE

02:22:31.242 --> 02:22:32.911
THING THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IS

02:22:32.977 --> 02:22:33.077
IS.

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:36.814
AN WE STARTED DOING A LOT OF

02:22:36.881 --> 02:22:37.982
SCHOOL INCLUSION CLASSROOMS FOR

02:22:38.049 --> 02:22:39.617
CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

02:22:39.684 --> 02:22:40.718
AND SO SOMEBODY HAD MENTIONED

02:22:40.785 --> 02:22:42.320
COST BENEFIT AND I DON'T HAVE

02:22:42.387 --> 02:22:44.422
THAT COST BENEFIT BUT YOU KNOW

02:22:44.489 --> 02:22:46.557
IN AYE AYE SENT DOWN AND I ASKED

02:22:46.624 --> 02:22:47.792
REALLY QUICKLY OUR PRESCHOOL

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:48.993
SPECIALIZED TEAM TO PULL THAT

02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:50.895
BECAUSE WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND

02:22:50.962 --> 02:22:51.329
TWENTY SIX OF THESE

02:22:51.396 --> 02:22:52.330
COLLABORATIVE CLASSROOMS.

02:22:52.397 --> 02:22:54.032
THAT ARE STAFFED WITH THAT EARLY

02:22:54.098 --> 02:22:55.099
CHILDHOOD SPECIAL LIKE

02:22:55.166 --> 02:22:56.801
CREDENTIAL TEACHER AN EARLY

02:22:56.868 --> 02:22:58.970
EDUCATION TEACHER AND THEN TO

02:22:59.037 --> 02:23:01.339
AIDS ONE SPECIAL AID AND ONE

02:23:01.406 --> 02:23:03.174
GENERAL AT EIGHT AND SO SHE SENT

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:04.509
BACK THE DATA AND IT WAS.

02:23:04.575 --> 02:23:06.477
OF OUR THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX

02:23:06.544 --> 02:23:10.581
KIDS WHO WERE IN TIME ET QUE --

02:23:10.648 --> 02:23:12.650
SLASH PCC THESE PRESCHOOL

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:15.486
COLLABORATIVE CON THREE HUNDRED

02:23:15.553 --> 02:23:16.254
AND FORTY TWO WENT TO

02:23:16.321 --> 02:23:18.890
KINDERGARTEN WITH SUPPORT.

02:23:18.957 --> 02:23:20.191
BUT DID NOT GO TO A SPECIAL DAY

02:23:20.258 --> 02:23:21.726
CLASS.

02:23:21.793 --> 02:23:24.262
AND THEN OF OUR AND THIS IS THE

02:23:24.329 --> 02:23:26.264
ONE THAT I HAVE LAST OUT ON BUT

02:23:26.331 --> 02:23:27.966
OF OUR FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:23:28.032 --> 02:23:31.135
ONE KITORANG ET QUE STE AND PCC

02:23:31.202 --> 02:23:32.537
WITH THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM

02:23:32.603 --> 02:23:33.438
I'M SORRY.

02:23:33.504 --> 02:23:34.973
THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WITH

02:23:35.039 --> 02:23:38.076
THEM AT THE PCC ATTACHED THERE

02:23:38.142 --> 02:23:39.177
WERE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE

02:23:39.243 --> 02:23:41.679
KIDS. NINETY EIGHT OF THOSE WENT

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:46.217
TO A A FULL TIME AT GENERAL

02:23:46.284 --> 02:23:47.518
EDUCATION KINDERGARTEN CLASS.

02:23:47.585 --> 02:23:50.154
NOW MIND YOU OF THOSE PCC SLASH

02:23:50.221 --> 02:23:50.822
YES PP SOME OF OUR THREE YEAR

02:23:50.888 --> 02:23:52.890
OLD SO SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY

02:23:52.957 --> 02:23:54.659
OF THOSE FOUR YEAR OLDS.

02:23:54.726 --> 02:23:56.160
HAD ACTUALLY MATRICULATED BUT IN

02:23:56.227 --> 02:23:58.129
EITHER CASE THAT'S OVER 50% OF

02:23:58.196 --> 02:23:58.796
THE KIDS WHO WERE IN THE SPECIAL

02:23:58.863 --> 02:24:01.733
DAY PROGRAMS THAT HAD GONE INTO

02:24:01.799 --> 02:24:03.234
A GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM.

02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:05.169
SO HAD THAT NOT BEEN THE CASE

02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:07.338
WERE TALKING ABOUT NO ALMOST

02:24:07.405 --> 02:24:07.939
NINE HUNDRED KIDS WOULD HAVE

02:24:08.006 --> 02:24:09.407
STARTED KINDERGARTEN BUT

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:12.210
PROBABLY BEEN IN A SPECIAL DAY

02:24:12.276 --> 02:24:12.410
CLASS.

02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:16.547
SO.

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:19.017
CHECK.

02:24:19.083 --> 02:24:20.885
IS IF YOU COULD BOTH SPEAK TO

02:24:20.952 --> 02:24:24.155
OUR COST RITUAL THAT MIGHT BE

02:24:24.222 --> 02:24:26.190
ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEIGHBORING.

02:24:26.257 --> 02:24:27.291
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT IS

02:24:27.358 --> 02:24:29.260
CURRICULA SPECIFIC FOR INSTANCE

02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:31.763
THE STEAM PROGRAM LANGUAGE

02:24:31.829 --> 02:24:38.169
PROGRAM HOW THOSE VERY FRIENDLY.

02:24:38.236 --> 02:24:44.075
YOUR STANDARD.

02:24:44.142 --> 02:24:44.675
BUT THERE IS A COST DIFFERENCE

02:24:44.742 --> 02:24:45.076
AT ALL [inaudible]

02:24:45.143 --> 02:24:49.514
SURE.

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:49.914
YEAH I MEAN THERE.

02:24:49.981 --> 02:24:52.016
ARE -- YOU

02:24:52.083 --> 02:24:53.951
HAVE TO INVEST.

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:56.054
IN YOUR YOU KNOW TEACHERS --

02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:57.422
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO DELIVER

02:24:57.488 --> 02:24:59.824
ANY CURRICULUM RIGHT SO --

02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:01.392
IF YOU'RE USING --

02:25:01.459 --> 02:25:02.527
MORE GENERAL CURRICULUM LIKE IN

02:25:02.593 --> 02:25:03.861
CREATED CREEK COMES PROBABLY THE

02:25:03.928 --> 02:25:04.328
MOST WIDELY USED --

02:25:04.395 --> 02:25:05.763
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY COST MORE

02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:07.665
TO DO A STEAM SPECIFIC CURRICULA --

02:25:07.732 --> 02:25:08.633
BUT TO DO ANY CURRICULAR WELL

02:25:08.699 --> 02:25:10.535
YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE ABLE

02:25:10.601 --> 02:25:11.135
TO INVEST IN BOTH PROFESSIONAL

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:13.938
DEVELOPMENT AND TO EFFECTIVELY

02:25:14.005 --> 02:25:16.107
IMPLEMENT.

02:25:16.174 --> 02:25:17.675
YEAH AND I I'D SAY WITH OTHER

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:18.609
THAN -- THE

02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:21.179
MATERIALS COSTS SO FOR OUR DUAL

02:25:21.245 --> 02:25:22.447
LANGUAGE PROGRAMS --

02:25:22.513 --> 02:25:24.282
WE WE DO USE CREATIVE CURRICULUM

02:25:24.348 --> 02:25:25.416
BUT IT'S THE SAME THING IT'S NOT

02:25:25.483 --> 02:25:27.351
NECESSARY THE CURRICULUM IT'S TO

02:25:27.418 --> 02:25:28.853
SUPPORT YOU PUT BEHIND IT.

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:29.887
AND SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF

02:25:29.954 --> 02:25:31.222
TRAINING I MEAN EVERY TEACHER

02:25:31.289 --> 02:25:32.723
HAS GONE THROUGH THAT TRAINING

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:33.658
AND THEN.

02:25:33.724 --> 02:25:34.892
GONE THROUGH WHAT WE CALL

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:36.160
CREATIVE CURRICULUM PART.

02:25:36.227 --> 02:25:37.695
TWO WHICH IS NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD

02:25:37.762 --> 02:25:39.230
A YEAR OF USING AT WHAT ELSE DO

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:40.264
YOU NEED TO NOW.

02:25:40.331 --> 02:25:42.233
AND I THINK WITH THAT.

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:43.167
AND THE COACHING IS A BIG PIECE

02:25:43.234 --> 02:25:44.469
OF THAT WITH OUR DOOR LANGUAGE

02:25:44.535 --> 02:25:45.870
PROGRAMS THE COACH IS GOING

02:25:45.937 --> 02:25:47.538
THERE AT LEAST.

02:25:47.605 --> 02:25:48.873
ADMINISTER ALMOST WEEKLY.

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.141
TIME TO VISIT THE TEACHER SO

02:25:50.208 --> 02:25:52.343
THAT ANY OF THE STRATEGIES THAT

02:25:52.410 --> 02:25:54.112
THEY'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE

02:25:54.178 --> 02:25:55.246
FOURTEEN DAYS OF PD THAT THEY GO

02:25:55.313 --> 02:25:55.947
THROUGH DURING THE COURSE OF THE

02:25:56.013 --> 02:25:57.048
YEAR.

02:25:57.115 --> 02:25:58.850
WE CAN MONITOR AND WE CAN WORK

02:25:58.916 --> 02:26:00.384
WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:01.819
THOSE STRATEGIES.

02:26:01.886 --> 02:26:03.187
THAT ARE REALLY BASED AROUND OR

02:26:03.254 --> 02:26:04.021
LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT ARE BEING

02:26:04.088 --> 02:26:04.722
USED.

02:26:04.789 --> 02:26:06.023
AND THEN WE GET A SUMMER BRIDGE

02:26:06.090 --> 02:26:07.859
PROGRAM WHERE THAT TEACHERS CAME

02:26:07.925 --> 02:26:08.960
FOR TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT.

02:26:09.026 --> 02:26:10.761
AND WORKED IN AN EARLY EDUCATION

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:12.430
CENTER CLASSROOM TO PRACTICE

02:26:12.497 --> 02:26:14.532
THOSE LESSONS AND AND SOME OF

02:26:14.599 --> 02:26:16.167
THE STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN.

02:26:16.234 --> 02:26:17.702
IN THAT THEY FOUND THAT THEY

02:26:17.768 --> 02:26:19.170
FELT LIKE THEY STRUGGLED WITH.

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:20.304
SO IT'S KIND OF A LESSON STUDY

02:26:20.371 --> 02:26:24.809
MODEL BUT I THINK THOSE KINDS OF

02:26:24.876 --> 02:26:27.745
INVESTMENTS AND BE SUCKED INTO

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:29.447
BE SIGNED STATE MATERIALS COSTS

02:26:29.514 --> 02:26:32.049
ARE THE ONES THAT YOU KNOW.

02:26:32.116 --> 02:26:35.953
REALLY BENEFIT THE TEACHERS. ONE

02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:39.624
FINAL QUESTION.

02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:41.692
I THINK I'M SORRY MY LIGHT KEEPS

02:26:41.759 --> 02:26:42.493
GOING OFF HARD TO TELL IF I IF

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:43.294
YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW I KNOW YOU

02:26:43.361 --> 02:26:43.661
CAN HEAR ME --

02:26:43.728 --> 02:26:45.863
I PARTICULARLY LIKE THAT YOU --

02:26:45.930 --> 02:26:47.131
HIGHLIGHTED YOUR STATISTIC ON

02:26:47.198 --> 02:26:49.300
PERSISTENCE THROUGH FIRST GRADE

02:26:49.367 --> 02:26:50.701
AND THE COSTS --

02:26:50.768 --> 02:26:52.770
YOU KNOW RECOUP TO THEIR WITH

02:26:52.837 --> 02:26:54.372
OFFERING HIGH QUALITY PRE K.

02:26:54.438 --> 02:26:56.474
PROGRAMMING WHAT OTHER KINDS OF

02:26:56.541 --> 02:26:57.875
LONGITUDINAL DATA IN BOTH

02:26:57.942 --> 02:26:59.243
PROGRAMS THAT ARE YOU COLLECTING

02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:00.411
AT THIS POINT ON STUDENTS WHO

02:27:00.478 --> 02:27:01.279
PARTICIPATE.

02:27:01.345 --> 02:27:02.980
IN YOUR PROGRAMS AND AND DO YOU

02:27:03.047 --> 02:27:05.283
TRACK THEM THEN ALL THE WAY

02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:08.853
THROUGH THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM.

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:10.254
WHAT I CAN SEE WE HAVEN'T

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:11.589
TRACKED HIM ALL THE WAY THROUGH

02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:12.924
THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM?

02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:14.759
AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO WE'VE

02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:16.360
BEEN WE'VE STARTED TO TRACK THEM

02:27:16.427 --> 02:27:17.595
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS FROM AN

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:18.863
EARLY HEAD PROGRAM TO THE

02:27:18.930 --> 02:27:20.231
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS.

02:27:20.298 --> 02:27:21.199
AND THE FIRST DATA WE LOOKED AT

02:27:21.265 --> 02:27:25.036
WAS NOW IT'S THE L. PACK BUT WE

02:27:25.102 --> 02:27:25.870
USED TO WE LOOKED AT CELL DATA.

02:27:25.937 --> 02:27:27.238
WHICH IS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:28.472
DEVELOPMENT TEST.

02:27:28.539 --> 02:27:30.575
SO WE COULD JUST SEE.

02:27:30.641 --> 02:27:32.376
IN COMPARISON TO KIDS YOU'VE

02:27:32.443 --> 02:27:33.978
NEVER HAD A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM

02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:36.380
AND HOW OUR KIDS SOMETHING IN SO

02:27:36.447 --> 02:27:37.715
WE FOUND OVERWHELMINGLY.

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:39.083
ALL THE KIDS WHO WERE COMING OUT

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:40.618
OF AN EARLY AND PROGRAM I'M I'M

02:27:40.685 --> 02:27:41.919
GONNA SAY OTHER THAN A FEW

02:27:41.986 --> 02:27:43.321
CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

02:27:43.387 --> 02:27:45.189
I'M SOUTH AT A TWO OR THREE AND

02:27:45.256 --> 02:27:47.725
MANY OF THEM I FACT SO WE KNOW

02:27:47.792 --> 02:27:48.859
THAT.

02:27:48.926 --> 02:27:49.927
DOWN THE LINE IT SAVES THE

02:27:49.994 --> 02:27:51.229
DISTRICT MONEY FROM HAVING TO

02:27:51.295 --> 02:27:53.097
INVEST IN PROGRAMS FOR AL TELLS

02:27:53.164 --> 02:27:54.732
OR LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS.

02:27:54.799 --> 02:27:56.567
AND THE OTHER DATA WE USE IS

02:27:56.634 --> 02:27:57.468
DOUBLES AND SO WE LOOK AT

02:27:57.535 --> 02:27:58.836
DOUBLES DATA AND AND IT'S KIND

02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:01.272
OF RESTRICTIVE BECAUSE IT REALLY

02:28:01.339 --> 02:28:02.673
LOOKS AT JUST A FEW AREAS.

02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:03.875
BUT THEY'RE GOOD PREDICTORS OF

02:28:03.941 --> 02:28:05.176
READING FLUENCY AND AND AND

02:28:05.243 --> 02:28:07.411
LATER ON SO WE'VE DONE THAT NOW

02:28:07.478 --> 02:28:08.646
WE'RE ENTERING OUR SECOND YEAR

02:28:08.713 --> 02:28:09.981
OF LOOKING AND IT'S WE HAVE

02:28:10.047 --> 02:28:11.449
KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE DATA.

02:28:11.515 --> 02:28:12.817
AND I WISH I HAD IT IN FRONT OF

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:15.286
ME BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:28:15.353 --> 02:28:16.654
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN KIDS WHO HAD

02:28:16.721 --> 02:28:18.222
AN EARLY AT PROGRAM AND THOSE

02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:20.558
WHO DIDN'T IT'S VERY DRASTIC.

02:28:20.625 --> 02:28:21.492
TIME.

02:28:21.559 --> 02:28:23.894
FROM KIDS WHO HAVEN'T HAD ANY

02:28:23.961 --> 02:28:26.163
PRESCHOOL EXPERIENCE --

02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:27.765
THANKS TO A LOCAL PILOT WE'VE

02:29:57.955 --> 02:29:59.924
OF THAT LESSONS THAT THAT WE

02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:01.759
LEARNED FROM.

02:30:01.826 --> 02:30:03.561
THE EAST COAST AND APPLY THEM

02:30:03.627 --> 02:30:04.228
AND SOME OF THE PRACTICAL ISSUES

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:06.530
THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:30:06.597 --> 02:30:07.331

YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS YOU KNOW

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:20.845
AND IT'LL SOUND OBVIOUS BUT WE

02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:21.746
STILL DON'T REALLY DO IT IN THE

02:30:21.812 --> 02:30:25.082
STATE -- YOU

02:30:25.149 --> 02:30:26.684
KNOW YOU NEED CLASSROOMS.

02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:28.285
IN ORDER TO SERVE KIDS --

02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:29.720
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY PRE

02:30:29.787 --> 02:30:32.823
SCHOOL FACILITIES FUNDING --

02:30:32.890 --> 02:30:35.626
AVAILABLE SO YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:39.096
AT THAT HAS MEANT IN THE PAST IS --

02:30:39.163 --> 02:30:40.898
YOU KNOW YOU FIND YOU KNOW YOU

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:41.499
SERVE KIDS WERE YOU CONFINED

02:30:41.565 --> 02:30:43.134
SPACE RIGHT WHICH ISN'T

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:44.568
NECESSARILY WHERE THERE IS THE

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:46.604
MOST NEED IN FACT A LOT OF TIMES

02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:48.639
WE TALK ABOUT PRESCHOOL DESERT'S --

02:30:48.706 --> 02:30:50.074
THERE'S A REASON WHY THERE ARE

02:30:50.141 --> 02:30:50.975
YOU KNOW IT'S NO PRESCHOOLS

02:30:51.041 --> 02:30:52.443
THERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO

02:30:52.510 --> 02:30:53.611
CLASSROOMS IN ORDER --

02:30:53.677 --> 02:30:55.546
TO SERVE THEM --

02:30:55.613 --> 02:30:58.616
AND I'M TELLING YOU THOSE DARN

02:30:58.682 --> 02:31:01.118
LITTLE TOILETS ARE EXPENSIVE.

02:31:01.185 --> 02:31:03.654
COST MORE THAN WIFI EVEN --

02:31:03.721 --> 02:31:06.791
NGUYEN THAT'S EXPENSIVE --

02:31:06.857 --> 02:31:09.460
TO TESTING IN THE WORK FORCE --

02:31:09.527 --> 02:31:11.362
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING --

02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:14.432
AMAZING TEACHERS IS NOT EASY --

02:31:14.498 --> 02:31:16.434
WITH THE SALARIES THAT WERE WERE

02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:17.968
PAYING -- I

02:31:18.035 --> 02:31:20.137
WILL SAY YOU KNOW SINCE WE'VE

02:31:20.204 --> 02:31:21.005
STARTED TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE

02:31:21.071 --> 02:31:22.973
WAGES MOVE INVESTED IN OUR WORK

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:25.242
FORCE --

02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:27.211
WE'VE SEEN OUR YOU KNOW TURN

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:29.580
OVER CUT IN HALF WHICH IS GREAT

02:31:29.647 --> 02:31:32.116
IT'S NOW AVERAGING AROUND 16%

02:31:32.183 --> 02:31:34.685
AND FOR OUR MID AND AN UPPER

02:31:34.752 --> 02:31:35.786
LEVEL --

02:31:35.853 --> 02:31:37.254
CREDENTIALED TEACHERS OF THESE

02:31:37.321 --> 02:31:38.856
ARE ARE SO SHE TEACHERS AND THE

02:31:38.923 --> 02:31:40.491
TEACHERS --

02:31:40.558 --> 02:31:42.827
THAT TURN OVER RATES DOWN 28%

02:31:42.893 --> 02:31:44.628
WHICH IS FANTASTIC THAT MATTERS

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:45.896
A LOT BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE NOT

02:31:45.963 --> 02:31:47.198
CONSTANTLY HAVING TO FILL

02:31:47.264 --> 02:31:48.833
EXISTING POSITIONS IN YOU CAN

02:31:48.899 --> 02:31:50.468
START TO EXPAND.

02:31:50.534 --> 02:31:52.136
AND SERVE MORE KIDS SO --

02:31:52.203 --> 02:31:54.138
YOU KNOW INVESTING IN CLASSROOMS

02:31:54.205 --> 02:31:55.573
IN INVESTING IN PEOPLE.

02:31:55.639 --> 02:31:59.477
ARM ARE BOTH CRITICAL.

02:31:59.543 --> 02:32:00.878
YEAH I WOULD ECHO THAT --

02:32:00.945 --> 02:32:02.079
THE FACILITIES IS ALWAYS A

02:32:02.146 --> 02:32:04.615
CHALLENGE AND WHEN WE LOOK AT RE

02:32:04.682 --> 02:32:06.750
OPENING SOME OF OUR CLOSE ENTERS

02:32:06.817 --> 02:32:08.886
AND AND TRYING.

02:32:08.953 --> 02:32:10.321
TO AND THE COST BEHIND IT.

02:32:10.387 --> 02:32:11.889
HE YOU MIGHT THINK TEN POINT ONE

02:32:11.956 --> 02:32:13.424
MILLION GOES A LONG WAY BUT THEN

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:15.359
WE STARTED LOOKING AT ALL THE

02:32:15.426 --> 02:32:17.695
EIGHTY A UPGRADES AND SMALL

02:32:17.761 --> 02:32:19.396
SMALL TOILETS YEAH [inaudible]

02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:23.300
IT SO WITH TEN POINT ONE IT'S

02:32:23.367 --> 02:32:25.002
IT'S NOT A LOT THE UNIT CAN

02:32:25.069 --> 02:32:27.338
ACTUALLY HAPPEN I THINK WHEN YOU

02:32:27.404 --> 02:32:28.672
TALK ABOUT PAINTING A PICTURE.

02:32:28.739 --> 02:32:30.608
MA'AM I THINK LONG TERM WE NEED

02:32:30.674 --> 02:32:32.276
TO DEVELOP BETTER CAREER

02:32:32.343 --> 02:32:34.345
PATHWAYS FOR FOLKS --

02:32:34.411 --> 02:32:35.980
INCLUDING CONTINUING AD --

02:32:36.046 --> 02:32:37.014
I THINK BRINGING BACK SOMETHING

02:32:37.081 --> 02:32:38.382
LIKE THE EARLY HEAD CREDENTIAL

02:32:38.449 --> 02:32:40.985
THAT WAS ON THE BOOKS IN CTC

02:32:41.051 --> 02:32:42.386
WOULD BE A HUGE THAT.

02:32:42.453 --> 02:32:44.255
TIME IT EXISTS.

02:32:44.321 --> 02:32:45.155
AND NOW IT'S A MATTER OF GETTING

02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:47.491
HIGHER INSTITUTES OF HIGHER ADD

02:32:47.558 --> 02:32:49.293
TO ONE AND ALSO BRING THAT BACK.

02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:50.628
THINK THAT FEEDS THE WORK FORCE

02:32:50.694 --> 02:32:53.898
AND THAT REALLY WANTS TO WORK

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:54.865
WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.

02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:56.100
YOU KNOW I CAN TELL YOU AS A

02:32:56.166 --> 02:32:57.434
FIFTH GRADE TEACHER.

02:32:57.501 --> 02:32:59.336
AND HAVING TO BE.

02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:00.871
PICK MY CLASS SELECTION BASED ON

02:33:00.938 --> 02:33:03.040
SENIORITY AND THEN THAT YOU KNOW

02:33:03.107 --> 02:33:04.074
FIVE YEARS LATER ALL OF A SUDDEN

02:33:04.141 --> 02:33:04.975
FINDING OUT THAT I'M NOT GONNA

02:33:05.042 --> 02:33:06.510
TEACH FIFTH GRADE AND I'M GONNA

02:33:06.577 --> 02:33:07.878
TEACH KINDERGARTEN.

02:33:07.945 --> 02:33:09.446
YOU NOW AFTER THAT FIRST TO HAVE

02:33:09.513 --> 02:33:11.348
KIDS CRYING I WAS IT I WAS READY

02:33:11.415 --> 02:33:12.650
TO CALL IT QUITS.

02:33:12.716 --> 02:33:14.285
BUT I THINK THOSE KINDS OF

02:33:14.351 --> 02:33:15.819
THINGS BECAUSE IF YOU INVEST IN

02:33:15.886 --> 02:33:17.288
THEM AND YOU INVEST IN PEOPLE

02:33:17.354 --> 02:33:18.989
WHO REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH OUR

02:33:19.056 --> 02:33:20.057
YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEN YOU PAID

02:33:20.124 --> 02:33:20.591
THEM.

02:33:20.658 --> 02:33:22.259
INAPPROPRIATELY YOU'RE GONNA GET

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:24.061
THEM AND BUT IT'S A MATTER OF

02:33:24.128 --> 02:33:25.462
ALIGNING THOSE OTHER PIECES SO

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:26.730
IN FIVE YEARS.

02:33:26.797 --> 02:33:28.132
I CAN DEFINITELY SEE WORKING

02:33:28.198 --> 02:33:29.066
WITH HIGH INSTITUTES OF HIGHER

02:33:29.133 --> 02:33:31.201
ED WORKING WITH CTC TO BRING

02:33:31.268 --> 02:33:32.670
BACK AN EARLY A CREDENTIAL OR

02:33:32.736 --> 02:33:34.738
EVEN AN ADDED AUTHORIZATION FOR

02:33:34.805 --> 02:33:36.006
PEOPLE HAVE A MULTIPLE SUBJECT.

02:33:36.073 --> 02:33:37.575
NEAR THAT WANT TO GO BACK AND DO

02:33:37.641 --> 02:33:38.208
SOMETHING.

02:33:38.275 --> 02:33:40.644
AND I THINK ALSO BRINGING KIND

02:33:40.711 --> 02:33:42.379
OF CLOUD CERTIFICATION TO EARLY

02:33:42.446 --> 02:33:44.114
EDUCATION TEACHERS WHERE THEY

02:33:44.181 --> 02:33:45.382
UNDERSTAND HOW TO WORK WITH.

02:33:45.449 --> 02:33:47.217
DOOR LANGUAGE LEARNERS BUT ALSO

02:33:47.284 --> 02:33:49.186
BE VERY VERY HELPFUL AND I THINK

02:33:49.253 --> 02:33:52.456
TEACHERS WOULD FIND IT HELPFUL.

02:33:52.523 --> 02:33:52.656
TIME.

02:33:52.723 --> 02:33:53.490
ON HIM.

02:33:53.557 --> 02:33:54.224
IF WE HAD MENTIONED TRAUMA

02:33:54.291 --> 02:33:55.559
INFORMED AND I THINK WITH THE

02:33:55.626 --> 02:33:57.528
POPULATIONS WE WORK WITH A LOT

02:33:57.595 --> 02:33:58.062
OF TIMES WITH SUBSIDIZED

02:33:58.128 --> 02:33:58.862
PROGRAMS.

02:33:58.929 --> 02:34:00.598
I THINK YOU NEED TO ALSO BRING

02:34:00.664 --> 02:34:02.499
BACK ORDERED LOOK AT PROVIDING

02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:03.667
TRAINING FOR TEACHERS AND TRAUMA

02:34:03.734 --> 02:34:05.035
INFORMED CARE AND WHAT DOES IT

02:34:05.102 --> 02:34:06.937
LOOK LIKE FOR THEM AS TEACHERS

02:34:07.004 --> 02:34:07.671
IN THE CLASSROOM.

02:34:07.738 --> 02:34:10.307
SO THIS WOULD BE KIND OF SOME OF

02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:13.644
THE IN. FOR STEPS IF.

02:34:13.711 --> 02:34:16.013
AS FAR AS THE CREDENTIAL OF

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:16.480
COURSE IT COMES WITH

02:34:16.547 --> 02:34:19.817
COMPENSATION I GUESS IT'S HARD.

02:34:19.883 --> 02:34:21.085
TO FOR SOMEBODY TO GET THE

02:34:21.151 --> 02:34:21.986
CREDENTIAL OF THEIR NOT GONNA

02:34:22.052 --> 02:34:22.152
GET.

02:34:22.219 --> 02:34:23.721
PAID.

02:34:23.787 --> 02:34:25.022
ACCORDINGLY TO HOW MUCH THEY

02:34:25.089 --> 02:34:27.791
COULD MAKE DURING ANOTHER CAREER

02:34:27.858 --> 02:34:29.660
DRESS STUDENT LOANS AND SO FORTH.

02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:31.328
SO AT THAT COULD TANGO YOU SAID

02:34:31.395 --> 02:34:33.030
YOU GIVE YOUR WORK FIRST FIVE

02:34:33.097 --> 02:34:35.432
GRAND A YEAR TO GO BACK. TO

02:34:35.499 --> 02:34:36.033
SCHOOL AND THEN GET IT WHAT'S

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:38.068
THE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WE'LL

02:34:38.135 --> 02:34:41.405
PAY YOU GIVE THE REWARD TEACHERS

02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:42.873
WHEN THEY GET THAT.

02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:44.675
BA SO WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DIFF

02:34:44.742 --> 02:34:45.209
BETWEEN THAT AND SOMEBODY

02:34:45.275 --> 02:34:47.411
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE --

02:34:47.478 --> 02:34:49.179
THE THE SALARY DIFFERENCE

02:34:49.246 --> 02:34:52.816
BETWEEN A TEACHER AIDE --

02:39:55.953 --> 02:39:57.387
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THEY

SAY IS NECESSARY IS A

02:39:59.122 --> 02:40:00.791

THING THAT THEY TELL ME IS IF

YOU'RE GOING TO REQUIRE IT --

02:40:20.877 --> 02:40:22.446

THINK THE PROPOSAL'S EIGHT YEARS

02:40:26.850 --> 02:40:28.552
CURRENTLY THEY'RE SUGGESTING TEN

02:40:28.618 --> 02:40:30.554
YEARS THAT'S I THINK NEGOTIABLE

02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:32.022
CERTAINLY --

02:40:32.089 --> 02:40:33.390

ANOTHER THING THAT TENTH THEY'RE

02:40:37.127 --> 02:40:38.362
TELLING ME IS THAT THEY CAN'T

02:40:38.428 --> 02:40:40.797

TIME AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS

02:40:48.905 --> 02:40:50.507
CAME UP SO IT HAS TO BE A

02:40:50.574 --> 02:40:53.410
SYSTEMIC APPROACH IN A PACKAGE.

02:40:53.477 --> 02:40:54.945
TO TO RATCHET UP THE QUALITY OF

02:40:55.012 --> 02:40:58.248
OF OF THE TEACHING WORKFORCE AND

02:40:58.315 --> 02:41:00.083
THEN YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THAT

02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:01.651
THEY'RE GETTING THE SALARY THAT

02:41:01.718 --> 02:41:02.452

SAN FRANCISCO IN LA AND SAN JOSE.

02:41:11.061 --> 02:41:12.763
SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME LANGUAGE

02:41:12.829 --> 02:41:14.731
THAT GUARANTEES THAT NOT JUST AN

02:41:14.798 --> 02:41:16.633
INCREASE AND REIMBURSEMENT RATES

THAT WE KEEP A CLEAR LINE

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:36.346

02:42:40.350 --> 02:42:41.585
SOME KIND OF TALK ABOUT EARLY

02:43:08.478 --> 02:43:11.982
FOR EDUCATORS TO BE COMPENSATED --

02:43:12.048 --> 02:43:14.384

02:43:33.537 --> 02:43:34.671

02:43:37.207 --> 02:43:39.176
WHEN WE HAVE THE LITTLE DARLINGS

02:43:39.242 --> 02:43:39.843

02:51:47.864 --> 02:51:49.465
PK TEACHERS WHO HAVE EARNED

02:51:49.532 --> 02:51:51.868
BACHELOR'S DEGREES AND HAVE

02:51:51.934 --> 02:51:54.070
ADDITIONAL SPECIALIZED TRAINING

02:51:54.137 --> 02:51:56.272
IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

02:51:56.339 --> 02:51:58.007
HAVE GENERALLY BEEN FOUND TO BE

02:51:58.074 --> 02:51:59.609
MORE EFFECTIVE.

02:51:59.676 --> 02:52:01.344
THAN THOSE WITHOUT THESE

02:52:01.411 --> 02:52:03.079
QUALIFICATIONS.

02:52:03.146 --> 02:52:05.481
THE NURSES TO FOR EDUCATION

02:52:05.548 --> 02:52:07.717
EARLY EDUCATION RESEARCH A WITCH

02:52:07.784 --> 02:52:08.785

02:52:12.422 --> 02:52:14.390
META ANALYSIS WHICH FOUND THAT

02:52:14.457 --> 02:52:15.892
CHILDREN WHOSE TEACHERS HAD

02:52:15.958 --> 02:52:17.927
EARLY CHILDHOOD BACHELORS

02:52:17.994 --> 02:52:18.728

ACHIEVED BETTER SIR COGNITIVE

02:52:21.531 --> 02:52:24.067
SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL OUTCOMES.

02:52:24.133 --> 02:52:25.735
SO AGAIN I THINK ON THIS POINT

02:52:25.802 --> 02:52:30.073
TO BE OF THE GENIUS OF YOUR

02:52:30.139 --> 02:52:32.375
APPROACH OF MISTER CARTY AND

02:52:32.442 --> 02:52:33.509
THOSE OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS

02:52:33.576 --> 02:52:34.477
COMMITTEE.

02:52:34.544 --> 02:52:36.546
IS THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST FOCUSING

02:52:36.612 --> 02:52:39.382
ON THE ACQUISITION OF A

02:52:39.449 --> 02:52:40.817
SPECIALIZED DEGREE.

02:52:40.883 --> 02:52:42.719
BUT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THE

02:52:42.785 --> 02:52:44.520
INTERNET INTO.

02:52:44.587 --> 02:52:47.757
BETWEEN COMPENSATION SO RESEARCH

02:52:47.824 --> 02:52:49.959
ALSO SHOWS THE CALIFORNIA PK

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:50.960
TEACHERS.

02:52:51.027 --> 02:52:53.429
UP IN NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND

02:52:53.496 --> 02:52:55.031
SEVENTEEN EARNED SIXTEEN DOLLARS

02:52:55.098 --> 02:52:56.899
IN NINETEEN CENTS PER HOUR WHAT

02:52:56.966 --> 02:52:59.001
KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS EARNED

02:52:59.068 --> 02:53:00.670
THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTY

02:53:00.737 --> 02:53:02.138
THREE CENTS PER HOUR STILL NOT

02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:02.839
ENOUGH.

02:53:02.905 --> 02:53:05.374
BUT THAT THE GAP IS ENORMOUS ARE

02:53:05.441 --> 02:53:07.677
CHIPPING GAP IS UNDOUBTEDLY

02:53:07.744 --> 02:53:09.712
DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS KIND OF

02:53:09.779 --> 02:53:10.980
SELLING CAM IS WELL.

02:53:11.047 --> 02:53:12.815
WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA YET BUT

02:53:12.882 --> 02:53:15.418
WE COULD PRODUCE SAID I'M SURE

02:53:15.485 --> 02:53:16.619
WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF RESEARCH.

02:53:16.686 --> 02:53:18.888
SO THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TRYING

02:53:18.955 --> 02:53:20.723
TO BRING COMPENSATION FOR STATE

02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:22.091
PRESCHOOL TEACHERS.

02:53:22.158 --> 02:53:24.127

IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

03:09:05.901 --> 03:09:07.769

CHILDREN AND EDUCATORS.

03:14:12.807 --> 03:14:14.275
THEY PRIORITIZE QUALITY AND

03:14:14.342 --> 03:14:15.944
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT FROM THE

03:14:16.011 --> 03:14:16.678
START.

03:14:16.745 --> 03:14:18.446
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN NORTH CAROLINA

03:14:18.513 --> 03:14:20.382
THEY FOCUSED FIRST ON HIGH

03:14:20.448 --> 03:14:22.283
QUALITY STANDARDS BY CREATING A

03:14:22.350 --> 03:14:24.185
STATEWIDE QUALITY RATING AN

03:14:24.252 --> 03:14:25.920
IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM OR Q. R. I.

03:14:25.987 --> 03:14:26.554
S..

03:14:26.621 --> 03:14:27.689
AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO

03:14:27.756 --> 03:14:29.157
THINGS LIKE IMPLEMENT MORE

03:14:29.224 --> 03:14:30.425
APPROPRIATE ADULT TO CHILD

03:14:30.492 --> 03:14:33.728
RATIOS AND ALSO PROVIDE ACCESS

03:14:33.795 --> 03:14:36.331
TO GOOD AT TEACHING ASSESSMENTS

03:14:36.398 --> 03:14:36.831
AND CURRICULUM FOR THEIR

03:14:36.898 --> 03:14:37.832
PROVIDERS.

03:14:37.899 --> 03:14:39.334
IN ADDITION ALL OF THEIR STATE

03:14:39.401 --> 03:14:41.236
FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE REQUIRED TO

03:14:41.302 --> 03:14:43.371
PARTICIPATE IN Q. R. S. AND THEY

03:14:43.438 --> 03:14:44.873
HAVE TO MEET A MINIMUM THRESHOLD

03:14:44.939 --> 03:14:46.474
OF QUALITY BEFORE THEY CAN GET

03:14:46.541 --> 03:14:47.509
LICENSE.

03:14:47.575 --> 03:14:48.376
THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE

03:14:48.443 --> 03:14:49.644
FROM OUR RESEARCH IS THAT

03:14:49.711 --> 03:14:50.979
LEADING STATES HAVE REALLY

03:14:51.046 --> 03:14:53.048
FOCUSED ON THE IMPROVEMENT PART

03:14:53.114 --> 03:14:54.315
OF Q. R. I. S..

03:14:54.382 --> 03:14:56.251
BY PROVIDING COACHES TO HELP

03:14:56.317 --> 03:14:57.352
THEIR PROVIDERS MEET THOSE

03:14:57.419 --> 03:14:59.421
HIGHER STANDARDS AND ALSO BY

03:14:59.487 --> 03:15:01.156
SUPPORTING EDUCATOR DEVELOPMENT

03:15:01.222 --> 03:15:03.191
BY DOING THINGS LIKE PROVIDING

03:15:03.258 --> 03:15:04.959
TEACHING STIPENDS.

03:15:05.026 --> 03:15:06.861
AND SALARY SUPPLEMENTS AND

03:15:06.928 --> 03:15:08.229
INSTRUCTIONAL COACHING FOR BOTH

03:15:08.296 --> 03:15:09.931
VETERAN AND NEW TEACHERS IT'S

03:15:09.998 --> 03:15:12.000
KIND OF SIMILAR TO INDUCTION AND

03:15:12.067 --> 03:15:13.435
OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM.

03:15:13.501 --> 03:15:14.936
THAT KIND OF SYSTEMATIC

03:15:15.003 --> 03:15:16.304
INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATOR

03:15:16.371 --> 03:15:17.739
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND

03:15:17.806 --> 03:15:19.607
INSTRUCTIONAL COACHING PRODUCES

03:15:19.674 --> 03:15:21.309
BETTER PREPARED EDUCATORS AND

03:15:21.376 --> 03:15:22.710
THAT'S BEEN LINKED TO IMPROVED

03:15:22.777 --> 03:15:24.512
OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN.

03:15:24.579 --> 03:15:26.815
BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ONLY

03:15:26.881 --> 03:15:29.284
14% OF ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS HAD

03:15:29.350 --> 03:15:31.453
ACCESS TO CURIOUS FUNDING WHICH

03:15:31.519 --> 03:15:32.754
CAN SUPPORT THOSE KINDS OF

03:15:32.821 --> 03:15:34.155
ACTIVITIES --

03:15:34.222 --> 03:15:37.158
BUT THE BRIGHT SPOT HERE IS THAT

03:15:37.225 --> 03:15:40.628
CALIFORNIA'S AND USEFUL CURIOUS

03:15:40.695 --> 03:15:42.230
SUPPORTS THAT COULD BE SCALED.

03:15:42.297 --> 03:15:43.698
AND OBVIOUSLY YOU ALREADY

03:15:43.765 --> 03:15:45.500
RECOGNIZE THIS GIVEN THE TOPIC

03:15:45.567 --> 03:15:46.601
OF THE HEARING BUT THERE ARE

03:15:46.668 --> 03:15:48.136
THINGS WE COULD POTENTIALLY

03:15:48.203 --> 03:15:49.737
LEARN FROM THE EXAMPLE SET OTHER

03:15:49.804 --> 03:15:51.439
STATES HAVE SAT.

03:15:51.506 --> 03:15:52.340
FORD --

03:15:52.407 --> 03:15:54.309
IMPLEMENTING THESE POSITIVE

03:15:54.375 --> 03:15:56.311
PRACTICES STATEWIDE THANK YOU

03:15:56.377 --> 03:15:59.147
THANK YOU.

03:15:59.214 --> 03:16:00.515
GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR

03:16:00.582 --> 03:16:01.583
HAVING THIS HEARING MY NAME IS

03:16:01.649 --> 03:16:03.952
ANNA LOUISE BENITO I'M WITH

03:16:04.018 --> 03:16:04.552
CALIFORNIA RULING CAN HEALTH

03:16:04.619 --> 03:16:06.488
BOARD AND THE DIRECTOR OF TRIBAL

03:16:06.554 --> 03:16:09.290
HEADSTART PROGRAMS AND TRAVEL.

03:16:09.357 --> 03:16:10.091
THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT

03:16:10.158 --> 03:16:12.393
PROGRAMS OF THAT EIGHTEEN TRIBES

03:16:12.460 --> 03:16:14.429
FOR THE DEVELOPMENTAL PART AND

03:16:14.496 --> 03:16:16.631
THREE TRIBES FOR HEAD START NOW

03:16:16.698 --> 03:16:18.533
WE'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN OUR

03:16:18.600 --> 03:16:20.502
PERSPECTIVE OF HOW WE SEE THIS

03:16:20.568 --> 03:16:21.970
BILL GOING FORWARD. ONE OF

03:16:22.036 --> 03:16:22.837
THINGS THAT.

03:16:22.904 --> 03:16:25.874
COMMON GROUND THAT WE ALL HAVE

03:16:25.940 --> 03:16:27.108
IS THAT DEVELOPMENT PART.

03:16:27.175 --> 03:16:29.144
NOT ONLY GETTING TEACHERS TO GET

03:16:29.210 --> 03:16:31.679
THE CREDENTIALS WE RECEIVE TRUE

03:16:31.746 --> 03:16:34.482
FEDERAL FUNDING OR LIMITED JUST

03:16:34.549 --> 03:16:35.683
IN MY AREA.

03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:39.420
WE HAVE BEEN STALEMATED AT THE

03:16:39.487 --> 03:16:41.022
FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS

03:16:41.089 --> 03:16:42.157
THAT MEANS IF I WANT TO PAY MY

03:16:42.223 --> 03:16:43.625
TEACHERS MORE.

03:16:43.691 --> 03:16:45.059
WE CANNOT THAT'S SOMETHING

03:16:45.126 --> 03:16:46.494
CALIFORNIA CAN AFFORD TO DO.

03:16:46.561 --> 03:16:48.329
BUT MY ATTRITION RATE IS FORCED

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:49.364
TEACHERS.

03:16:49.430 --> 03:16:52.033
VERY MINIMAL MAYBE MAYBE 2%

03:16:52.100 --> 03:16:52.967
LEAVE ME.

03:16:53.034 --> 03:16:54.502
AND THAT'S NOT BAD BECAUSE WE DO

03:16:54.569 --> 03:16:56.404
OTHER INCENTIVES WE ALLOW THEM

03:16:56.471 --> 03:16:57.672
TO GO TO SCHOOL AND HAVE TIME

03:16:57.739 --> 03:16:59.274
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN

03:16:59.340 --> 03:17:00.575
YOU BUILD THESE THINGS UP.

03:17:00.642 --> 03:17:02.010
YOU TALK SOMEWHERE IN THERE

03:17:02.076 --> 03:17:04.646
ABOUT MAYBE DO.

03:17:04.712 --> 03:17:06.614
LOCAL COLLEGES THAT TRAIN

03:17:06.681 --> 03:17:08.816
TEACHERS WHETHER IT'S THE BE A

03:17:08.883 --> 03:17:10.251
OR THE A A THAT THEY HAVE SOME

03:17:10.318 --> 03:17:13.021
SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH THE LOCAL.

03:17:13.087 --> 03:17:15.023
PRE K. OR IN THIS SYSTEM MAYBE

03:17:15.089 --> 03:17:16.124
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT THEY

03:17:16.191 --> 03:17:18.059
CAN DO THE PRACTICUM THERE AND

03:17:18.126 --> 03:17:19.594
THAT WOULD BE FOR TEACHERS.

03:17:19.661 --> 03:17:20.795
THAT ARE CURRENTLY ALREADY THERE

03:17:20.862 --> 03:17:22.263
HAVE THE EXPERIENCE.

03:17:22.330 --> 03:17:24.999
YOU CANNOT TEACH EARLY EDUCATION

03:17:25.066 --> 03:17:27.202
THE SOMEONE WHO WALKS OFF THE

03:17:27.268 --> 03:17:29.204
STREET WOULD JUST TO BE A I'M

03:17:29.270 --> 03:17:30.271
TELLING YOU THIS FROM EXPERIENCE

03:17:30.338 --> 03:17:33.875
I GOT MY POLY SCI BE A AS WELL.

03:17:33.942 --> 03:17:36.144
IN MY LAW DEGREE WALKING IN AS A

03:17:36.211 --> 03:17:36.878
DIRECTOR OF THESE TYPES OF

03:17:36.945 --> 03:17:38.279
PROGRAMS.

03:17:38.346 --> 03:17:40.014
THE CURVE IS HARD SO YOU'VE GOT

03:17:40.081 --> 03:17:41.849
A RIGHT NOT IT'S NOT UNDOABLE

03:17:41.916 --> 03:17:43.351
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT QUALITY.

03:17:43.418 --> 03:17:44.686
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE

03:17:44.752 --> 03:17:46.387
GOT THOSE IN THERE --

03:17:46.454 --> 03:17:50.024
ALSO WE PUT MY GLASSES ON

03:17:50.091 --> 03:17:53.561
BECAUSE OF REACH THAT AGE --

03:17:53.628 --> 03:17:54.896
IN THE YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT YEAH

03:17:54.963 --> 03:17:55.997
IT'S THE BENEFIT FOR THE

03:17:56.064 --> 03:17:57.131
CHILDREN MOST DEFINITELY.

03:17:57.198 --> 03:17:58.866
CONTINUITY.

03:17:58.933 --> 03:18:00.535
COMING FROM THESE PROGRAMS MANY

03:18:00.602 --> 03:18:02.303
OF OUR FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE THE

03:18:02.370 --> 03:18:04.806
CONTINUITY TO HOW THE FULL DAY

03:18:04.872 --> 03:18:05.406
THIS WOULD BE IF THIS COULD BE

03:18:05.473 --> 03:18:07.141
THE FOLDING.

03:18:07.208 --> 03:18:08.576
YOU WERE GOING TO REDUCE COSTS

03:18:08.643 --> 03:18:10.078
FOR THOSE PARENTS WHO HAVE TO DO

03:18:10.144 --> 03:18:12.080
THE PRE K. AND THEN TAKE THEM

03:18:12.146 --> 03:18:13.014
ELSEWHERE.

03:18:13.081 --> 03:18:15.216
THE COST ALONE CAN RANGE

03:18:15.283 --> 03:18:16.751
ANYWHERE BETWEEN PART TIME.

03:18:16.818 --> 03:18:19.053
AS LOW AS MAYBE FIFTY SIX

03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:21.389
HUNDRED WITH MUCH AS TWENTY FIVE

03:18:21.456 --> 03:18:22.824
THOUSAND A YEAR IN CHILD CARE.

03:18:22.890 --> 03:18:25.927
TO LAUNCH IN IF THE MINIMUM WAGE

03:18:25.994 --> 03:18:26.561
AND THESE ARE JUST OLD NUMBERS I

03:18:26.628 --> 03:18:27.829
HAVE.

03:18:27.895 --> 03:18:28.463
OF WHEN THEY'RE MAKING ELEVEN

03:18:28.529 --> 03:18:29.097
DOLLARS AN HOUR I THINK IT WAS

03:18:29.163 --> 03:18:32.000
LIKE THIRTEEN THOUSAND THREE

03:18:32.066 --> 03:18:32.600
HUNDRED SIXTY IS WHAT A FAMILY

03:18:32.667 --> 03:18:34.602
WOULD BRING IN.

03:18:34.669 --> 03:18:36.738
BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY.

03:18:36.804 --> 03:18:37.405
FIVE THOUSAND WORDS THE REST FOR

03:18:37.472 --> 03:18:37.705
YOUR RENT.

03:18:37.772 --> 03:18:38.840
IT'S THINKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS

03:18:38.906 --> 03:18:41.209
THAT MAKE IT A POSITIVE IF YOU

03:18:41.276 --> 03:18:43.811
DO THIS ALL AND LASTLY

03:18:43.878 --> 03:18:44.112
[inaudible]

03:18:44.178 --> 03:18:44.512
THINK [inaudible]

03:18:44.579 --> 03:18:46.881
OF HELLO.

03:18:46.948 --> 03:18:48.483
WHEN YOU WRITE LEGISLATION LIKE

03:18:48.549 --> 03:18:49.784
THIS SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE

03:18:49.851 --> 03:18:52.620
PLEASE INCLUDE THE WORD TRIBES?

03:18:52.687 --> 03:18:53.955
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW EVERYTHING IS

03:18:54.022 --> 03:18:55.390
DONE BY STATUTE AND IF WE DON'T

03:18:55.456 --> 03:18:56.724
HAVE AN IN STATUTE SOMETIMES OF

03:18:56.791 --> 03:18:57.959
PARTNERSHIPS AND WE'VE BEEN

03:18:58.026 --> 03:18:58.960
LUCKY THAT WE DO WORK WITH.

DURING A MILIEU.

03:19:04.832 --> 03:19:05.366
BUT WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE

AND SENSE.

03:19:14.575 --> 03:19:16.711
THE TOPIC OF SOME OF OUR STUDIES

03:19:16.778 --> 03:19:19.347
CAME UP TODAY I THOUGHT I WOULD

03:19:19.414 --> 03:19:21.282
JUST -- TRY

03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:23.351

SO OFTEN WHEN THE TOPIC OF

03:19:32.493 --> 03:19:33.895
PRESCHOOL COMES UP.

03:19:33.961 --> 03:19:35.763
THE MAIN FOCUS IS ACCESS.

03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:39.200
AND THE QUESTION IS ACCESS TO

03:19:39.267 --> 03:19:40.268
WHAT.

03:19:40.335 --> 03:19:41.869
AND YOU'RE ASKING THE

03:19:41.936 --> 03:19:44.205
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION.

ELS CHAIRMAN MCCARTY MENTIONED.

03:19:47.342 --> 03:19:48.810
THE LAST TIME THAT THERE WAS

03:19:48.876 --> 03:19:52.747
REALLY AN ESTIMATE OF UNMET NEED.

03:19:52.814 --> 03:19:56.017
FOR PRESCHOOL IN.

03:19:56.084 --> 03:19:57.352
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A ARE FOUND

03:19:57.418 --> 03:20:00.321
THAT THERE WERE. THIRTY THREE

03:20:00.388 --> 03:20:03.658
THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS ELIGIBLE --

03:20:03.725 --> 03:20:05.993

PRE K..

03:20:10.231 --> 03:20:12.266
AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

03:20:12.333 --> 03:20:14.769
SIX THOUSAND THREE YEAR OLDS.

03:20:14.836 --> 03:20:17.438
AND WE WERE REALLY LOOKING NOT

JUST AT ALL CHILDREN IN LICENSE

03:20:19.674 --> 03:20:22.210
CARE BUT WE TRIED TO LOOK AT THE

03:20:22.276 --> 03:20:23.811
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST

03:20:23.878 --> 03:20:25.646
STANDARDS THE CLOSEST. TO THE

03:20:25.713 --> 03:20:27.982
NEAR STANDARDS SO WE LOOKED AT

03:20:28.049 --> 03:20:29.751
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN STATE

03:20:29.817 --> 03:20:31.919
PRESCHOOL THE NUMBER IN HEAD

03:20:31.986 --> 03:20:33.087
START.

AND THE NUMBER IN TWO U. K..

03:20:34.021 --> 03:20:37.225
IF WE HAVE.

03:20:37.291 --> 03:20:39.293
NOT RESTRICTED TO THE QUALITY

03:20:39.360 --> 03:20:41.295
THAT LEVEL OF QUALITY.

03:20:41.362 --> 03:20:43.197
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN SERVE

03:20:43.264 --> 03:20:46.768
MIGHT HAVE LOOKED BETTER. TO

03:20:46.834 --> 03:20:48.102
LEGISLATORS MIGHT OF BEEN A

03:20:48.169 --> 03:20:50.772
NICER NUMBER OF A SMALLER NUMBER.

03:20:50.838 --> 03:20:53.007
BUT THE POINT IS EVEN THOSE

03:20:53.074 --> 03:20:55.243
THREE PROGRAMS DON'T MEET THE

03:20:55.309 --> 03:20:56.644
STANDARDS A DOCTOR PRETTY.

03:20:56.711 --> 03:20:57.812
DESCRIBED.

03:20:57.879 --> 03:21:01.115
SO THAT WAS SORT OF OUR OUR BASE.

03:21:01.182 --> 03:21:03.851
AND WE WILL BE WORKING ON A

03:21:03.918 --> 03:21:06.120
NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

03:21:06.187 --> 03:21:07.588
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.

03:21:07.655 --> 03:21:09.791
THAT IS PART OF THE FEDERAL

03:21:09.857 --> 03:21:11.526
PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT THAT

03:21:11.592 --> 03:21:12.960
CALIFORNIA.

03:21:13.027 --> 03:21:14.529
ONE AND THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS

03:21:14.595 --> 03:21:16.297
GOING TO TAKE IN NOT ONLY THE

03:21:16.364 --> 03:21:18.699
ISSUES THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE.

03:21:18.766 --> 03:21:21.702
BUT ALSO THE UNMET NEED FOR

03:21:21.769 --> 03:21:25.239
FACILITIES --

03:21:25.306 --> 03:21:27.175
ALSO JUST WANTED.

03:21:27.241 --> 03:21:29.377
TO MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT T. K.

03:21:29.444 --> 03:21:31.145
SENSE THAT HAS COME UP.

03:21:31.212 --> 03:21:33.014
THE STUDY THAT A. I. R. DID OF

03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:36.651
TKD DID INDEED FIND THE CHILDREN

03:21:36.717 --> 03:21:37.852
NTK.

03:21:37.919 --> 03:21:38.986
WERE -- HAD

03:21:39.053 --> 03:21:40.521
BETTER [inaudible]

03:21:40.588 --> 03:21:44.025
OUTCOMES THAN CHILDREN IN GARDEN

03:21:44.091 --> 03:21:46.794
VARIETY PRESCHOOL 80% OF THE

03:21:46.861 --> 03:21:48.095
CHILDREN IN THE CONTROL GROUP

03:21:48.162 --> 03:21:48.696
WERE IN PRESCHOOL [inaudible]

03:21:48.763 --> 03:21:52.200
BUT NOT NECESSARILY HIGH QUALITY

03:21:52.266 --> 03:21:53.968
PRESCHOOL.

03:21:54.035 --> 03:21:55.703
AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT THAT

03:21:55.770 --> 03:21:58.840
STUDY IS THAT THE CHILDREN IN

03:21:58.906 --> 03:21:59.307
TWO K..

03:21:59.373 --> 03:22:00.708
WERE -- THE

03:22:00.775 --> 03:22:02.410
CLASS SIZE AT THE TIME THAT WE

03:22:02.477 --> 03:22:04.479
DID THE STUDY THE AVERAGE CLASS

03:22:04.545 --> 03:22:08.015
SIZE WAS.

03:22:08.082 --> 03:22:11.052
SEVENTEEN AND SOME OF THE QUITE

03:22:11.118 --> 03:22:12.286
OF I CAN'T REMEMBER FOR WAS

03:22:12.353 --> 03:22:15.156
THIRD OF ABOUT A THIRD OF THE

03:22:15.223 --> 03:22:16.524
CLASSROOMS DID HAVE A PARA

03:22:16.591 --> 03:22:19.293
PROFESSIONAL FOR PART OF THE DAY.

03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:19.961
TO SUPPLEMENT.

03:22:20.027 --> 03:22:20.928
THE TEACHER SO I THINK THAT'S

03:22:20.995 --> 03:22:22.396
JUST.

03:22:22.463 --> 03:22:24.098
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE

03:22:24.165 --> 03:22:25.833
CONSIDERING --

03:22:25.900 --> 03:22:28.402
CHANGING THE STAFF CHILD RATIO

03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:29.904
FORTY K. AT THE SAME TIME THAT

03:22:29.971 --> 03:22:32.707
YOU'RE CONSIDERING UPGRADING

03:22:32.773 --> 03:22:35.309
STATE PRESCHOOL.

03:22:35.376 --> 03:22:36.344
ARM FINALLY.

03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:37.845
JUST A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT.

03:22:37.912 --> 03:22:42.450
IT'S ALWAYS A WORK TO DO THAT --

03:22:42.517 --> 03:22:43.551
ABOUT.

03:22:43.618 --> 03:22:46.821
I THINK NEARLY A DECADE AGO.

03:22:46.888 --> 03:22:48.990
A. R. DID A STUDY OF A PRESCHOOL

03:22:49.056 --> 03:22:51.158
FOR ALL PROJECT.

03:22:51.225 --> 03:22:53.594
YES HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:22:53.661 --> 03:22:56.130
IT WAS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY.

03:22:56.197 --> 03:22:57.732
AND IT WAS FUNDED BY FIRST FIVE

03:22:57.798 --> 03:22:59.267
SAN MATTEO AND FIRST FIVE

03:22:59.333 --> 03:23:00.701
CALIFORNIA.

03:23:00.768 --> 03:23:02.570
AND WHAT THE FOUND.

03:23:02.637 --> 03:23:04.405
WAS WHAT THE GOAL OF THAT

03:23:04.472 --> 03:23:05.373
PROGRAM.

03:23:05.439 --> 03:23:07.708
WAS EXACTLY WHAT --

03:23:07.775 --> 03:23:09.477
I THINK YOU'RE NOW THINKING OF

03:23:09.544 --> 03:23:10.411
DOING.

03:23:10.478 --> 03:23:12.647
UPGRADINGTHE QUALITY OF SOME OF

03:23:12.713 --> 03:23:13.915
THE EXISTING PROGRAMS LIKE STATE

03:23:13.981 --> 03:23:16.551
PRESCHOOL AND HEAD START.

03:23:16.617 --> 03:23:19.620
AND OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS.

03:23:19.687 --> 03:23:20.988
THE TEACHERS THAT WERE THAT

03:23:21.055 --> 03:23:23.991
GAINED EIGHTY EIGHT DEGREES --

03:23:24.058 --> 03:23:25.826
THERE WAS A HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT

03:23:25.893 --> 03:23:26.894
FOR THEM IT WENT DIRECTLY INTO

03:23:26.961 --> 03:23:28.062
SALARIES.

03:23:28.129 --> 03:23:29.797
AND THE SAME THING FOR THOSE

03:23:29.864 --> 03:23:31.933
TEACHERS THAT GAINED OF A BA

03:23:31.999 --> 03:23:33.301
DEGREE.

03:23:33.367 --> 03:23:35.603
THEY HAD A HIGHER COMPENSATION

03:23:35.670 --> 03:23:36.938
THAN -- THAN

03:23:37.004 --> 03:23:39.373
THE OTHER TEACHERS --

03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:41.976
THE THERE WAS AN EVALUATION OF

03:23:42.043 --> 03:23:43.678
THE IMPROVEMENTS IN PROGRAM

03:23:43.744 --> 03:23:44.879
QUALITY [inaudible]

03:23:44.946 --> 03:23:48.015
SOME OF PEOPLE IN THE ROOM I'M

03:23:49.817 --> 03:23:51.152
CLASSROOM ASSESSMENT.

03:23:51.218 --> 03:23:52.853
SCORING SYSTEM.

03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:54.855
AND IT HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

03:23:54.922 --> 03:23:57.425
MEASUREMENTS ONE OF THEM IS ON

03:23:57.491 --> 03:23:59.260
INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT.

03:23:59.327 --> 03:24:01.162
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PRESCHOOL

03:24:01.228 --> 03:24:03.164
CLASSROOM --

03:24:03.230 --> 03:24:04.999
THAT IS THE MEASURE THAT SEEMS

03:24:05.066 --> 03:24:07.835
TO BE MOST CORRELATED.

03:24:07.902 --> 03:24:09.503
WITH --

03:24:09.570 --> 03:24:10.538
