LIKE TO BEGIN BY CALLING THE SELECT COMMITTEE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY INFORMATIONAL HEARING TO ORDER. THIS GUY WAS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WHAT I'M USED TO ON THE ON THE ROSTER BUT- IT'LL IT'LL DO I THINK. THIS IS THE BUSY SEASON IN THIS BUILDING AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. ELSEWHERE MIGHT BE A SUMMER SLOWDOWN BUT THIS IS OUR BUSY TIME OF THE YEAR SO MEMBERS HAVE TO BE IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AT THE SAME TIME. I AM PLEASED THAT WE'RE JOINED BY OUR BUDGET SHARE MY ASSEMBLY CALI FEEL TANG WHO JOINED AS I KNOW THAT DOCTOR WOULD CHAIRMAN OF OUR HEALTH COMMITTEE WILL BE COMING BY AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE AS THE AFTERNOON. ROLLS ALONG SO I WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU. AT TO THIS HEARING. I AM HONORED. TO CHAIR THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON BIOTECHNOLOGY OUR OVER ARCHING GOAL WITH THIS COMMITTEE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FAMILIAR. WITH THIS BODY. IS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS UP TO DATE A WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE BIOTECH INDUSTRY IN OUR STATE. THE SELECT COMMITTEE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY FOCUSES ON THREE. KEY ASPECTS OF THE BIOTECH ECOSYSTEM IN OUR STATE. OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. IMPORTANT LEGAL AND REGULATORY ISSUES IMPACTING THE INDUSTRY. AND HOW THIS INDUSTRY IS SUPPORTING OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. TODAY'S HEARING IS VERY APPROPRIATE THAT IN PROVIDING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE WORKING TO ADVANCE. PRECISION MEDICINE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PRECISION MEDICINE ENVISIONS A SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE. THAT IS HIGHLY COORDINATED AND TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED. IN WHICH PATIENTS PROVIDERS AND RESEARCHERS CAN ACCESS THE BEST RESEARCH TRIALS AND FINDINGS. AND THE BEST DATA AND TOOLS. TO DRIVE DECISION MAKING. IT IS DRIVEN BY ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE INCEASING AVAILABILITY. AND GRANULARITY OF DATA. THE CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE WAS LAUNCHED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE STATE INITIALLY PROVIDED THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO CREATE A FIRST IN THE NATION STATEWIDE PRECISION MEDICINE PROGRAM. SINCE THAT TIME IT IS GROWN INTO A FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE INITIATIVE WITH THE SUPPORT OF KEY PARTNERS INCLUDING U. C. S. F. INITIATIVE SUPPORTS PATIENT FOCUSED. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AND CONNECTS HEALTH AND MEDICINE STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. IN OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF THE PRECISION MEDICINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS CHARGED WITH PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS TO ESTABLISH CALIFORNIA AS A NATIONAL LEADER IN PRECISION MEDICINE AND HEALTH THROUGH THE CREATION OF STATEWIDE POLICIES. THE PMAC DELIVERED ITS ACTION PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA TO THE GOVERNOR IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. TODAY'S HEARING PROVIDES A FORUM FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RECEIVE UPDATES ON PROJECT THAT CI A P. M. HAS FUNDED. AND TO HEAR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE THREE AGENDA ITEMS TODAY WHICH WE WILL WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED BY TWO OR MORE EXPERTS PER AGENDA ITEM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS LOVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE PRESENTERS AFTER EACH ITEM. WE WILL ALSO WANT TO GIVE A CHANCE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF OUR HEARING AND OUR GOAL IS TO WRAP UP AT THREE PM IF NOT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO AT LEAST. MAKE AVAILABLE FOR MR TANG ANY OPENING REMARKS AND THEN WE CAN MOVE INTO OUR PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY. WE WERE I WAS THE BUDGET CHAIRMAN WE DID THE INITIAL APPROPRIATION AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND TO SEE REALLY NOT ONLY THE FUNDING GROW BUT THIS FIELD TO GROW AT THE VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA IS A TESTAMENT TO. VERY MUCH THE CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH TO CUTTING EDGE THINKING. AND VERY MUCH THE CUTTING EDGE ANALYSIS THAT IS GOING ON AT EACH OF OUR CRITICAL INSTITUTIONS VERY. PROUD ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING VERY EXCITED TO THROUGH THE HERE. FROM ALL THE FACULTY MEMBERS HERE TODAY ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON BUT ALSO REALLY WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO TO KEEP. SUPPORTING THE SEPARATES CAN BE SUCH A CRITICAL EFFORTS I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THE THAT YOUR RESEARCH IS GOING TO REALLY. HELP BREAK LOOSE MUCH OF THE- FUTURE AROUND HOW WE CHAT TACKLE SOME OF THESE VERY CRITICAL DISEASES THAT WE ALL FACE AS A SOCIETY HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR HARD. WORK AND AGAIN VERY EXCITED ABOUT HEARING THE TESTIMONY TODAY. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE BUDGET FRONT MR TANG. AND I DO WANT TO INTRODUCE MY LEAD STAFF FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND RAISING GOLLY WHO ALSO DOUBLES AS MY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR. ON OTHER ISSUES BUT IS DEVELOPING AN EXPERTISE. IN THIS ARENA SO WITH THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANEL WE HAVE DOCTOR SHE IN A MIRROR. AND DR JULIE AND A CALL FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH PR. AS WELL AS DOCTOR CLARA LAW JOHN SHARE FROM THE UCLA INSTITUTE FOR PRECISION HEALTH. AND 'M NOT GOING TO READ THEIR BIOS BECAUSE THAT WILL EAT UP SOME TIME HERE TODAY AND WE WANT TO GET TO THE MEAT OF THE DISCUSSION BUT- I BELIEVE THERE ARE HAND OUT SO YOU CAN SEE THEIR COMPLETE. BIOS WHICH ARE VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. AND WE WELCOME ALL OF YOU. TO THE PANEL AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE GOING TO START WITH DOCTOR BEAR THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND OTHER GUESTS MY NAME IS SHANNON YOUR AND I'M ONE OF THE SCIENCE INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE. MY COLLEAGUE DR JULIAN RECALL AND IARE HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. TO GIVE YOU A SHOW OUR SHORT OVERVIEW OF THE INITIATIVE AND AN UPDATE ON THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN. FUNDED AS A VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION. PRECISION MEDICINE IS AN APPROACH TO DISEASE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE EFFECTIVENESS BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY IN JEANS ENVIRONMENT AND LIFESTYLE. IT IS GENERALLY MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH USING GENETICS TO SELECT TREATMENT REGIMENS THAT WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE. BUT ALSO INCLUDES IDENTIFYING PATIENTS THAT ARE AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING DISEASE AND PROVIDING EARLY INTERVENTIONS. CAM CAN IN SOME CASES PREVENT DISEASE ALTOGETHER. THE GOAL OF PRECISION MEDICINE IS TO REDEFINE. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE TREATMENT RESPONSE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES THROUGH MORE PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTORS. THE CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE IS THE ONLY PROGRAM OF ITS KIND IN THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE STATE HAS FUNDED COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN RESEARCHERS CLINICIANS COMMUNITY GROUPS AND INDUSTRY. AT TO FOSTER THE CREATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPIES THAT CAN IMPROVE HEALTH FOR CALIFORNIANS AS HE MENTIONS THE INITIATIVE WAS LAUNCHED IN BY THE STATE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SINCE THEN. EIGHT DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WITH ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FROM UCSF. WE PROVIDEDYOU WITH A REPORT THAT CONTAINS FORMAL INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF EACH OF THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. THESE PROJECTS COVER A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS FROM DEPRESSION AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS TO HEART DISEASE AND REPRESENTS AN INVESTMENT OF ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING. DR BRENDAN SPIEGEL IS A PREVIOUS AWARDEE WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING LATER ON ABOUT HIS. WORK. THE CURRENTLY FUNDED DEMONSTRATE PROJECTS ALL FOCUSED ON CANCER AND SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES IN OUTCOMES THAT EXIST BETWEEN POPULATIONS OF PATIENTS. IS A BOULDER ON FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE LATINO CANCER INSTITUTE IS A CURRENT A WORDY AND YOU WILL ALSO BE HEARING ABOUT HER WORK LATER ON. AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE ALLOCATED FUNDS BY LINING OUR STRATEGY WITH OTHER STATE ENTITIES INCLUDING THE SURGEON GENERAL. THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA CANCER REGISTRY. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN FUNDING FROM THE STATE HAS RESULTED IN SEVENTEEN NEWS ARTICLES AND PRESS RELEASES INCLUDING A STORY THAT FEATURED ON THE COVER. OF TIME MAGAZINE. EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN MATCHING FUNDS AND IN KIND FUNDS. AND ADDITIONAL FOLLOW ON FUNDING IS EXPECTED TO FLOOD OF TEAMS BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S INITIAL INVESTMENT. OUR TEAMS OF ALSO GENERATED TWENTY FIVE PEER REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS THUS FAR AND GIVEN SEVENTY PRESENTATIONS ABOUT THEIR WORK INCLUDING A TEN MINUTE TALK BY UCSF PROFESSOR CHARLES TRUE. THE STAFF AND THE LEADERSHIP OF A PR THRILLED BY THE BY THE SUCCESSES OF OUR RESEARCH TEAMS AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEFINE. THE FUTURE OF THE INITIATIVE AND THE FIELD OF PRECISION MEDICINE. I WOULD NOW INVITE CLARA TO DISCUSS THE PRECISION MEDICINE ACTION PLAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ALL ALL ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE INVITATION TO PRESENT. SEE JULIANNE IS GONNA BRING UP MY SLIDES. I'LL INTRODUCE MYSELF DR CLEAR ELECTION SHARE ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE UCLA INSTITUTE FOR PRECISION HEALTH ALSO AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF NEUROLOGY AT UCLA I WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH OPR ON THE PRECISION MEDICINE ACTION PLAN TO REPORT THAT I BELIEVE FOLKS EITHER HAVE A COPY OF OR- HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERUSE. AND I'M ALSO WORKING WITH PR AS AN ADVISER ON THE CAL THE CIA PM AND THE NEXT ROUND OF FUNDING THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. SEE SO THE PRECISION MEDICINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE JUST VERY BRIEFLY I BELIEVE THAT CHAIRMAN MULLIN ALREADY DESCRIBED THAT AND THE KEY AGAIN IS TO THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WAS REALLY WANTING TO DELIVER A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ON FIGURING OUT STRATEGIES ON HOW WE COULD MAKE PRECISION HEALTH THE PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE A REALITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND I WANT TO TAKE PAUSE TO HIGHLIGHT ALL CALIFORNIANS UNFORTUNATELY PRECISION MEDICINE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN EASILY END UP TAKE TAKING CARE OF THE 1% AND SO. THROUGHOUT THE COMMITTEE ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE VERY MINDFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ALL. THE COMMITTEE WAS CO CHAIRED BY. DOCTOR KELSEY MARTIN WHO'S THE DEAN OF THE DAVID GEFFEN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT UCLA. AND DOCTOR A TOOL BUTTE WHO IS PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF THE BOOK CAR COMPUTATIONAL HEALTH SCIENCES INSTITUTE AT USF AT UCSF. THE COMMITTEE WAS COMPRISED OF SIXTEEN KEY OPININ LEADERS AND POLICY MAKERS ACROSS VARIOUS SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA WHAT WAS EXCITING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT WASN'T LIMITED TO ACADEMICS WHICH IS OFTEN TIMES VERY VERY TYPICAL FOR A LOT OF THESE COMMITTEES. THE COMMITTEE WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE STAKEHOLDERS FROM INDUSTRY ACADEMIA HEALTH SYSTEMS POLICY MAKERS AND OTHER INDUSTRY MEMBERS. OF IT AND I WILL I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT THE QUOTE HERE IS VERY TELLING THE COMMITTEE BROUGHT TOGETHER PERSPECTIVES FROM A VARIETY OF INSTITUTIONS. AND PRECISION MEDICINE IN CALIFORNIA CAN ONLY BE REALIZED THROUGH THESE PARTNERS WORKING COLLABORATIVELY SHARING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE ACROSS INSTITUTIONS AND ACROSS THE STATE. AND VERY BRIEFLY THIS JUST HIGHLIGHTS THE BROAD REPRESENTATION ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE DIFFERENT SECTORS. THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE DIVIDED ACROSS FOUR KEY AREAS DATA IN THE CONTEXT OF PRECISION MEDICINE WHAT DO WE DO WITH ALL OF THE DATA THAT ARE GENERATED. CALIFORNIANS AS PARTNERS IN CARE AND RESEARCH SPECIFICALLY COMMUNITY PATIENTS HOW DO THEY INTERACT WITH THE PRECISION IT WITHIN THE IT PRECISION MEDICINE ECO SYSTEM. EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT HICH IS A HUGE PRIORITY FOR ALL PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE INITIATIVES BECAUSE WE'RE CREATING IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO REQUIRE. A VERY DIFFERENT WORKFORCE AND THE LAST IS REGULATORY CHALLENGES AND I'LL BE TOUCHING UPON SOME OF THESE IN IN THE NEXT FEW SLIDES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE VERY MINDFUL OF AS WE THOUGHT WELL AS WE THOUGHT ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS OR THE COMMITTEE THOUGHT WAS WAS. DELIBERATING ON RECOMMENDATIONS WERE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS ECONOMIC NEIGHBORHOOD PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT THINGS LIKE HOUSING TRANSPORTATION. OF FOOD COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL INTEGRATION AS WELL AS HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ALL OF THESE INFLUENCE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THERE'S A LOW VERBAL WIDE BODY OF DATA. THAT SHOWS THE IMPACT ON MORTALITY MORBIDITY EXPECTANCY AT IS AND IT CAN IMPACT THE ECONOMY TREMENDOUSLY. WHAT WE DID IS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS MET YOU EACH HAVE A COPY OF THE ENTIRE LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE WERE TRYING TO THINK OF WHICH RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE MOST ACTIONABLE AND MOST. RELEVANT TO THIS PARTICULAR SELECT COMMITTEE ON BIOTECHNOLOGY. SO I'M JUST GOING TO PRESENT A FEW OF THEM AND OPEN FOR QUESTIONS ON THESE AS WELL AS ANY OF THE OTHERS THAT THAT ARE INTERESTING TO MEMBERS. THE FIRST IS THE LEGISLATOR SHOULD REQUIRE VENDORS OPERATING CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE API'S OR APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES TO ALLOW HEALTH SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE BROADER PATIENT ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE E. H. R. DATA. WITH THE FIRST THING THATIT IS WAS WAS DISCUSSED. WAS THAT PATIENT ACCESS TO THEIR OWN EHR DATA IS INCREDIBLY LIMITED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO RADIOLOGY SCANS PATHOLOGY IMAGES OR CLINICAL NOTES. THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE GO BEYOND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CARES ACT WHICH WHICH MANDATES THAT PATIENTS DO HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR IT TO THEIR CLINICAL DATA AND REQUIRED VENDORS TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA TO PATIENTS THROUGH THESE API'S. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE GREATER ACCESS. APR EYES OR SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSED A LOT IN THE CONTEXT OF DATA. BECAUSE MANY HELD E. H. R. SYSTEMS DON'T EVEN TALK TO EACH OTHER SO THE KEY IS FOR THERE TO BE. INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT INTER OPERABILITY. THAT WOULD ALLOW NOT JUST PATIENTS TO INTERACT WITH THE H. R. BETTER BUT PATIENTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PROVIDERS AND FOR FOLKS THAT ARE IN DIFFERENT HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT YOU CHORE COMMUNICATE ACROSS ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. THE SECOND IS RECOMMENDATION AND AS YOU CAN SEE ALONG THE YELLOW THOSE ARE THE KEY AREAS. MOST OF THESE ARE CROSS CUTTING IN THE SENSE THAT THEY- THEY ARTICULATE WITH IT SOMETIMES ONE BUT IN MOST CASES MORE THAN ONE AREA OF. DEVELOPMENT HERE. SO THROUGH LEGISLATION AND INCENTIVES THE COMMITTEE FELT STRONGLY THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD REDUCE BARRIERS FOR PATIENTS TO OBTAIN AND SHARE THEIR DATA AND CORRECT ERRORS IN THEIR EHRS. WE KNEW THAT WE KNOW THAT EACH OUR DATA RIDDLED WITH ERRORS BUT IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE THE DATA FOR PRECISION MEDICINE THE DATA HAVE TO BE ACCURATE SO WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A MECHANISM BY WHICH WE START GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT. THE COMMITTEE FELT STRONGLY THAT PATIENTS SHOULD BE STORED OF THEIR OWN DATA CURRENTLY HEALTH SYSTEMS BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE THE STORE IT'S OF DATA OF PATIENT DATA. BUT PATIENTS ACTUALLY WANT TO HAVE A MECHANISM BY WHICH TO CREATE AND UPDATE THEIR OWN DATA TO PREVENT ERRORS. AND THIS WAS A TOPIC OF A LOT OF DISCUSSION FOR THE COMMITTEE THEY FELT THAT A LOT OF PATIENTS THAT DID THE INFORMATION IN THE H. R. WAS INCORRECT SO IMAGINE PRESENTING TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM AND SOMEBODY HASN'T INCOMPLETE. INCOMPLETE MEDICATION LIST OR A PHYSICIAN IS TRYING TO TREAT YOU FOR SOMETHING AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A LIST OF ALL CURRENT MEDICATIONS AND SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE CONTRAINDICATED ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S A SURGICAL PROCEDURE. ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION THAT THAT THEY FELT THAT PATIENTS FELT NEEDED TO BE CORRECTED PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO SHARE ONLINE DATA WITH ANY PROVIDER REGARDLESS OF THE BRAND OF EACH OUR SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE THE KID TO MAKE TO THE COMMITTEE FELT PRETTY STRONGLY THAT PATIENTS AS STEWARDS OF THEIR OWN DATA SHOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHO ELSE GETS ACCESS. TO THOSE DATA. INCLUDING RESEARCHERS. AND LASTLY THE COMMITTEE FELT THAT PATIENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONSENT TO SHARE ANY SUBSET OF THEIR DATA SPECIFICALLY FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH. THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION THAT WE THOUGHT WAS VERY RELEVANT HERE IS IN IN THE AREA OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS. AND HERE THE GOAL WAS TO ENACT LEGISLATION TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE TELL GINA WHICH IS THE GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT AND TO ENSURE THAT IT PREVENTS THE ON AUTHORIZED USE OF GENETIC INFORMATION TO INFLUENCE WHETHER IT'S EMPLOYMENT OR EFFECT ACCESS TO HEALTH LIFE. AND MORE SPECIFICALLY HERE LIFE LONG TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE SO TO TAKE A STEP BACK THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL LAW GINA. PREVENTS EMPLOYERS ARE HEALTH INSURERS FROM USING GENETIC INFORMATION TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM GETTING A JOB OR HEALTH INSURANCE. GINA DOES NOT HOWEVER APPLY TO EMPLOYERS WITH FEWER THAN FIFTEEN EMPLOYEES. IT ALSO DOES NOT APPLY FOR INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY SEVERAL FORMS OF FEDERAL AND MILITARY INSURANCE. THROUGH CAL GINA SO CALIFORNIA WENT AHEAD AND ADDED EXTRA PROTECTIONS CALIFORNIA EXPANDED THEM TO INCLUDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES HOUSING MORTGAGE LENDING EDUCATION AND OTHER STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS BUT NOT LIFE FOR DISABILITY INSURANCE. THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CAN ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE WAS THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD EXTEND THESE PROTECTIONS TO THE INCLUDES LIFE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE THERE SEVENTEEN STATES THAT HAVE LAWS THAT ARE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR LIFE AND SEVENTEEN FOR DISABILITY I DON'T KNOW THE OVERLAP IS AMONG THOSE ARE BETWEEN THOSE STATES. AND EIGHT FOR LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE YOU CAN IMAGINE A PATIENT WITH HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE HUNTINGTON'S IS AN AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT DISORDER WHICH MEANS THAT ALL IT TAKES IS FOR ONE PERSON OR OR ONE COPY OF THE PARTICULAR MUTATION IN THE H. T. T. JEAN. FOR YOU TO DEVELOP OUTSIDE PART OF ME HUNTINGTON'S. OFF SPRING I HAVE A FIFTY PER CHECK PERCENT CHANCE OF DEVELOPING THE DISORDER. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE. VERY MANY ANONYMOUS TESTING SITES BECAUSE PATIENTS ARE MORTIFIED OF HAVING THIS INFORMATION LEAKED TO WHAT E. IT TO ANYBODY THAT COULD PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING DISABILITY INSURANCE OR LIFE INSURANCE SPECIFICALLY. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN MOST DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF OUR PATIENTS IS THAT THEY ARE REFUSING TO HAVE GENETIC TESTING WHEN MEDICALLY NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT RAMIFICATIONS. ON THE DISCRIMINATORY SIDE. OOPS OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSION SO IN SUMMARY. THE COMMITTEE FELT VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTENT COME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THESE RECOMMENDATIONS A RESERVE IT WAS UNANIMOUS THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE. IT WAS ALSO IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH AN ECONOMIC AND COST MODEL COUNCIL PRECISION MEDICINE THE FEARS ARE THAT IT COULD EASILY BANKRUPT US NOT AS AN ONLY AS A NATION BUT AS THE STATE IF NOT DONE WELL. SO TO CONTINUE THE WORK IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT AND IF INFORMED FUTURE FUNDING AND POLICY DECISIONS IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF COUNSEL. NOW JUST TO REITERATE IT REITERATE VERY BRIEFLY THROUGH THE CIA PM. THE STATE HAS INVESTED FIFTY THREE MILLION TO SUPPORT RESEARCH AND PRECISION MEDICINE ACROSS THE STATE. THE FIRST THIRTEEN MILLION BROUGHT IN A MATCHING TEN MILLION AN INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION AND PRIVATE FUNDS THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE OUTSIDE FUNDING. IN ADDITION TO CANCER WERE STRATEGIES OUR MOST ADVANCED THE RECOMMENDATION RESOUNDINGLY WAS TO INVEST THE REMAINING THIRTY MILLION WHICH IS WHICH RIGHT NOW WE ARE WORKING ON. IN OTHER HIGH IMPACT DISEASE AREAS SUCH AS DIABETES UP VERY IMPORTANT MENTAL HEALTH ESPECIALLY DEPRESSION CHILD HEALTH. AND OTHER A DISEASE AREAS OF INTEREST. AND SO LASTLY THROUGH STRATEGIC POLICY MAKING AND SEED FUNDING CALIFORNIA CAN BECOME THE GLOBAL EXEMPLAR. IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF PRECISION MEDICINE TOOLS THAT WILL IMPROVE HEALTH AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES WITHOUT BREAKING THE BANK. AND SO THE KEY IS TO MAKE THIS A REALITY FOR ALL. AND NOT JUST THE 1% THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR AND I APPRECIATE OF THAT LAST POINT OF EMPHASIS AROUND. ACCESS FOR ALL AND DEMOCRATIZING SMALL THE ACCESS TO A PRECISION MEDICINE ACROSS THE STATE I THINK THAT'S IN THE SPIRIT. OF WHAT THIS A COMMITTEE TO SELECT COMMITTEE STRIVES FOR AND I APPRECIATE THAT I DO WANT TO WELCOME. MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN DIEGO AREA ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND ARMOR MINORITY LEADER. MARIE WALDRON THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON FOR JOINING US I HAD JUST A. COUPLE OF QUICK ONES ON THAT. ISSUE AROUND DATA AND ERRORS. WHAT IS GENERALLY THE SOURCE OF THOSE ERRORS. AND WHY ARE HEALTH SYSTEMS SO RESISTANT. TWO PATIENTS OWNING THEIR OWN. DATA WELL. THAT'S IT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE THOSE WERE TWO KEY ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED AT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL EAT THE EHRS ARE RIDDLED WITH ERRORS AT FOR A LOT OF REASONS MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE PUTTING IN DATA. AS YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME LAB VALUES THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN CORRECTIVE KIDDING THAT CAME BACK FROM A PARTICULAR LAB AND THEY WERE WRONG AND THEY WERE REPEATED OR FLAG. YOU MAY HAVE THE PATIENTS WHO ARE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY THEMSELVES ARE PROVIDING THE INFORMATION TO THE PROVIDER THE UPDATED INFORMATION TYPICALLY WHAT A LOT OF HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE DOING IS THAT AT AT FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE PATIENT. THEY WILL ASK THEM WHETHER THEY'LL CHECK THEIR MEDICATIONS AND THERE'S A PROTOCOL THAT THEY USE THAT THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TYPICALLY USED TO MAKE SURE THAT. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DATA ARE CORRECT. I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE Q. WHY PROCESS SEES THAT ARE A WHY DATE YOU KNOW HOW OR WHY I KNOW THAT YOU SEE LIKE WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE HEALTH SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY ERRORS. AND SOMETIMES. THERE'S ONE THING TO IDENTIFY THEM THERE'S ANOTHER TO IDENTIFY THEM AND GET THEM BACK TO THE SOURCE. AND SO IT IT DOES THAT IT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE WRESTLING WITH WHEN IT COMES TO A DATA CLEANING. SO I AM INTERESTED IN LEGISLATING IN. THE CAL G. I. N. A. ARENA WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE REMAINS TO BE SEEN BY WELCOME A CONVERSATION. ON THAT BUT YOU MENTIONED SEVENTEEN OTHER STATES FOR EXAMPLE EXTENSOR PROTECTIONS TO LIFE INSURANCE FOR EXAMPLE. JUST ANSWER A BIGGER PICTURE. HOW DOES CALIFORNIA'S STACK UP IN RELATION TO SAY OTHER STATES WHO SEE THIS AS AN IMPORTANT AREA. HOW DO WE SIR HOW DO WE RANK SO TO SPEAK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER STATES WITH WITH INVESTMENT IN THIS SECTOR. SO I WILL SAY THAT CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS IN ONCE GINO WAS RELEASED IN DEFINITELY TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF PRIVACY AND DISCRIMINATION WITHIN THE FIELD OF GENETIC AND GENOMIC MEDICINE. UP WE DO PROVIDE WE HAVE MANY PROVISIONS EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES MORTGAGE LENDING AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS THAT OTHERS DON'T COVER I DO THINK THAT LOVE THAT LIFE DISABILITY AND LONG TERM CARE. ARE REALLY CRITICAL AND FOR US TO. COMBAT SORT OF SORT OF MOVE THE NEEDLE AND REALLY SUPPORT OR ACT ACTUALLY AT JUST AT PAR WITH OUR WITH OUR OTHER STATES WOULD BE A HUGE LEAP FORWARD. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AND MISS WALDRON I WANTED TO FORTY THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS SINCE YOU'RE KIND ENOUGH TO JOIN US. THANK YOU IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. I FIND. PRECISION MEDICINE AND THE DATA DRIVEN MEDICINE TO BE SUCH A OF A POTENTIAL FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE RIGHT NOW AND ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW AS THE CHAIRMAN SAID. IN MEDI CAL YOU KNOW GETTING ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF TREATMENT AND YOU KNOW THE DATA FOR FOLKS EVEN IN MEDI CAL IS SOMETHING THAT WE STRIVING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND YOU KNOW I ALWAYS TRY TO ADVOCATE FOR THE SINGLE MOM WHO CAN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. HOW IS SHE GOING TO GET FOR HER CHILD YOU KNOW THE BEST CARE BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN I BELIEVE WILL SAVE MONEY IF WE DO THAT BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION. OF WOULD JUST KIND OF A GENERAL QUESTION WHEN WE LOOK AT. DATA COLLECTION AND YOU KNOW THEN THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES BARRIERS WITH PRIVACY AND HIP ANOTHER THINGS. HOW CAN WE- ATTAIN THE DATA THAT WE NEED TO IN SPITE OF THAT YOU KNOW IS. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK THE QUESTION VOTE COULD BECAUSE WE NEED ACCESS TO THE DATA I DO A LOT OF WORK WITH AIDS HIV IN THAT FIELD AND YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE TO THE- TRYING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE DATA SO THAT WE CAN. USE IT TO HELP. YOU KNOW THE. THE GOOD OF THE WHOLE WITHOUT IMPACTING THE INDIVIDUAL AND THAT'S IT THAT'S THAT'S IT THAT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE WITHIN THE FIELD OF PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE AND ONE THAT WAS DEFINITELY DISCUSSED WITHIN THE WIT WITHIN THIS COMMITTEE UP ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES AND. YOU SEE THIS EVERYWHERE IT'S NOT JUST WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY NOT WANTING TO SHARE DATA ACADEMICS. ON THE A FOR ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS DATA BREACHES ARE. FEARED SO EVERYBODY IS VERY MINDFUL THAT AS STEWARDS OF DATA THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT LEAKED AND THAT WE ARE BEING FAITHFUL AND- OF. AUTHENTICS TOWARDS ONE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE COMMITTEE ACTUALLY DID. DID DISCUSS AT LENGTH WAS HAVING SOME SORT OF CENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE TO BE INCENTIVIZE TO PARTICIPATE. THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE OBVIOUSLY A DATA AGREEMENTS IN PLACE SO THERE WOULD THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A GROUP THAT PERHAPS COULD COME UP WITH. DATA USE AGREEMENTS CONFIDENTIALLY CONNECTICUT FOR THE CHARITY IN PRIVACY AGREEMENTS UP FOR PATIENTS TO SHARE THEIR DATA DEPENDING ON THE KIND OF DATA THEY NEED TO PROVIDE CONSENT AND SO THERE HAVE TO BE INCENTIVES FOR FOLKS TO RE CONSENT PATIENTS THAT. HAVE NOT BEEN CONSENTED WITH WHATEVER CURRENT LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE TO GO IN THERE SO I DO THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS TOP OF MIND FOR THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE. BECAUSE BRINGING DATA TOGETHER PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE IS IT'S ABOUT LOOKING FOR PATTERNS IN DATA ENTRY. WHAT'S GOING TO GET US THERE IS A LOT OF DATA. SO THE MORE DATA WE HAVE THE BETTER WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PREDICTIONS SO. CRITICS FOR THE STATE TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO CREATE A BODY AN ENTITY AND A MECHANISM. TO SUPPORT THAT WOULD I THINK WHAT AT INCREDIBLE VALUE. I HAVE A LITTLE BIT TAD IF I MAY UM WE- YOU MENTIONED INFORMED CONSENT AND THAT. IN PRACTICE MEANS. READING A SCRIPT AND HAVING TO BE SIGNED SOMETHING AND THAT MIGHT BE VERY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE CULTURE BACKGROUND AND LANGUAGE OF THE PERSON IT IS HE'S BEEN CONSENTED SO HAVING A- CULTURALLY COMPETENT. CONSENT IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW AND I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND ONE OF THE AN EXAMPLE OF KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF. THE BARRIERS TO SHARING RESEARCH AND THE EFFECT THAT IT IS CURRENTLY HAVING ON CLINICAL CARE IS THAT. PHYSICIANS WHO TREATS PATIENTS WITH DRUG ADDICTIONS ARE BY LAW NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH ANY OTHER. TREATING PHYSICIANS AND THAT LAW WAS PUT INTO PLACE A LONG TIME AGO WHEN ADDICTION MEDICINE THE SORT OF THOUGHT OF AS ITS OWN ISLAND OF CARE. BUT NOW WE AS WE INCORPORATED INTO AT THE BROADER MENTAL HEALTH CARE IT MIGHT BE TIME TO REVISIT THOSE FEDERAL GUIDELINES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT TO ONE OF OUR PREVIOUSLY FUNDED GRANTS TO DOCTOR SHELDON GREENFIELD AT UC IRVINE HE WAS DEVELOPING A FEDERATED DATA SYSTEM WHERE BY VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS V. A.'S YOU SEE AND COUNTY HOSPITALS WERE ABLE TO SHARE THEIR DATA WITHOUT STEPPING ACROSS THEIR OWN INSTITUTIONAL DATA PRIVACY. POLICIES SO IT WAS ACCESS TO DE IDENTIFY DATA WITHOUT ACTUALLY PROVIDING DATA FOR THEM TO USE FOR ANY REASON. FEDERATED DATABASE SYSTEM IT'S SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE ABSOLUTELY AND SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE FOLKS LESS SKITTISH IF YOU SAY THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEIR DATA BUT THE DATA CAN BE FEDERATED THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT IS. IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL AND BUT IT IS IT HAT WE HAVE DATA TO SHOW THAT IT IS A VERY POSITIVE. AVENUE IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO IT RESPOND TO A COMMENT THAT YOU HAD MADE. WITH RESPECT TO THE 1% AND TO MEDI CAL PATIENTS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS NOT IN THE REPORT BUT IT IT COULD HAVE INCREDIBLE VALUE IS THE IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRANSLATIONAL PIPELINE WE'RE COLLECTING ALL OF THIS DATA. AND AT AND WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF HOW THESE DATA OR THIS INFORMATION IS DELIVERED TO PATIENTS IT TO PATIENTS ON THE OTHER SIDE THE BEDSIDE SO TO SPEAK. AND THERE'S A FEDERAL BILL THAT'S BEEN SITTING THAT WOULD MAKE GENETIC COUNSELORS CMS PROVIDERS CURRENTLY THEY'RE NOT AND BY MAKING THEM CMS PROVIDERS IT WOULD IT WOULD ACTUALLY INCREASE ACCESS TO FOLKS WHO IN MEDICARE AND ALSO MEDI CAL AND SO PERHAPS THE STATE COULD. DO SOMETHING TO FASTER TO CONSIDER MAKING GENETIC COUNSELORS PROVIDE A PROVIDERS FOR MEDI CAL PRIOR TO THAT BILL MOVING THROUGH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO QUESTION FOR. DOCTORS MAYOR AND MCCALL OF THESE EFFORTS WERE STARTED ANOTHER BROWN ADMINISTRATION WE'RE NOW INTO THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION. AND JUST WANT TO GET A FEEL FOR WHAT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION'S VISION AS FOR CONTINUING LEADERSHIP. IN THIS ARENA SORT OF A GENERAL QUESTION. BUT IF I COULD ADD LITTLE SPECIFICITY AS I INDICATED AT THE TOP WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WORK FORCE PIPELINE ARE CRUCIAL TO THE CHARTER OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND THEN JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT ON. HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION SPECIFICALLY ON THAT WORK FORCE PIECE TO RELIEVE. YOUR BILL THIS OUT AND BRING ACCESS ACROSS. THE BROAD GEOGRAPHY OF OUR STATE. CERTAINLY THE- CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS VERY INTERESTED IN REACHING OUT TO OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRIORITIES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH OTHER EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS ALIGN WITH EACH OTHER AND SO WE CAN REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED AND USETHAT TO IT'S YOU KNOW MAXIMUM CAPABILITY AND IN THAT VEIN WE ARE NEWLY COORDINATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA CANCER REGISTRY THE NEWLY APPOINTED SURGEON GENERAL AND THE ASKED AT THE- OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH. PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALSO AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF REACHING OUT TO OTHER PARTNERS AND IN THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PAIN AND SO YOU WE REALIZE THAT IS IMPORTANT ONE THING IS THAT OUR CURRENT STATUTE DOES NOT INCLUDE. A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PIECE IN IT THIS STATUE THAT WAS WRITTEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SO WE TECHNICALLY AREN'T ALLOWED TO JUDGE THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSALS ON ANY AMOUNT OF TRAINING OR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THEY DO AND SO INCORPORATING THAT PIECE. AT INTO THE STATUTE MIGHT BE ONE WAY FIXING THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEGE BEFORE WE RELEASE THE PANEL VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOTS OF DETAIL OF BEING PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON IN THESE REPORTS GRATEFUL FOR TAKING THE TIME. ALL THE ALL THREE OF YOU TO SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE WITH US THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT WE WILL. THANK YOU WE WILL TRANSITION. TO OUR- SECOND AGENDA ITEM. WE'RE GONNA DO A SLIDE SWITCH OUT HERE I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO THE PANEL DOCTOR RENDON SPIEGEL FROM CEDAR SINAI MEDICAL CENTER. AS WELL AS ISABEL DERON OF THE LATINO CANCER INSTITUTE. AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE BAY AREA REPORTERS AS A AS A BAY AREA JOURNALISM STUDENT FROM BACK IN THE DAY IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU. WITH US AT THE CAPITOL TODAY IS STRONG AND WITHOUT. I THINK WE'LL START WITH. DOCTOR SPIEGEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO THE STATE FOR FUNDING ARE CAPM PROJECT AND MICHAEL TODAY IS TO PRESENT TO YOU. HIGH LEVEL RESULTS OF ONE OF THE FUNDED PROJECTS AND MORE SO TO PROVIDE SORT OF A VISION OF HOW WE CAN THINK ABOUT PRECISION MEDICINE AS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. AND SHOW SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT AT CEDAR SINAI MY ROLE CEDAR SINAI'S AND THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH I'M ALSO A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH AT UCLA AND AN ASSISTANT DEAN. IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL AT UCLA. SO OUR FOCUS IN THIS PROJECT AND I JUST WANT TO SAY I LOVE LIVING IN A STATE THAT LOVE SCIENCE SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND PRESENT THESE RESULTS. IS REALLY FOCUSED ON AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE ALL PEOPLE ACROSS SOCIOECONOMIC STRAT A AND THAT'S HEART DISEASE AND I WANT TO START WITH AN IMAGE THIS IS. FRIEND OF MINE NAMED ERIN AND AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT HE IS MONITORING A GROUP OF PATIENTS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE BEEN WIRED UP WITH WEARABLE BIOSENSORS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IS NOTICING CHANGES ON AN EKG THAT SUGGESTS THAT SOMEBODY MAY BE ABOUT TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK SO HE CALLS UP THAT PATIENT. AND HE SAYS HOW ARE YOU FEELING MISTER ANDERSON AND HE SAYS I'M FEELING FINE HE SAYS I NEED TO TAKE TWO ASPIRINS AND GO TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK. NOW TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT REAL THIS IS A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR SET. ON THE BACKLOT OF UNIVERSAL STUDIOS. AND THIS IS A TELEVISION SHOW THAT WAS PRIME TIME AND CBS BASED UPON OUR RESEARCH GRANT FROM CA A PM. SO I WAS FORTUNATE TO PARTICIPATE AND SCRIPTING THIS SHOW AND BEING A PART OF THE SHOW THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BEING A LOS ANGELES BUT THIS IS A VISION. OF WHERE WE WANT TO BE AND WHAT WE STUDY DOES WHETHER WE ACTUALLY CAN GET THERE. SO THIS ISN'T SO SCIENCE FICTION THERE ACTUALLY ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS IN REAL LIFE RIGHT NOW THIS IS A MERCY HEALTH SYSTEM. IN THE MIDWEST AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE EXAMPLES LIKE THIS IN CALIFORNIA. DOESN'T LOOK QUITE AS FANCY BUT WE HAVE THE ABILITY NOW. TO USE WEARABLE BIOSENSORS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING TECHNIQUES. TO EVALUATE PATIENTS WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE HOSPITAL WITH US WHEN THEY'RE NOT RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR IN A CLINIC. OR IN AND I'M OPERATING ROOM. SO WE CAN DO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE ACCESS NOW TO ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT DEVICES THIS IS CREATED BY. A COMPANY CALLED ALIVE CORE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE CAR GET DEVICES IS AN FDA CLEARED DEVICE THAT WE USE REGULARLY AND USED IN THIS STUDY. TO MONITOR PATIENTS HEARTS. IT IS AN FDA CLEARED EKG MONITOR. YOU CERTAINLY MAY HAVE HEARD THAT APPLE HAS ITS OWN AT FTA CLEARED VERSION OF THIS AS WELL FOR THE FOR THE APPLE WATCH. AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT DEVICES THAT COME FROM. MANY OF OUR PARTNERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA FITBIT FOR EXAMPLE IS A COMPANY WE WORK CLOSELY WITH AND I'LL SHOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW WE WORK WITH THAT THAT. THAT CREATES A NUMBER FOR DEVICES. THERE'S EVEN A BELT THAT HAS A COMPUTER IN IT I HAPPEN OWN THAT BUILT THAT IT'S A VERY NICE BELT. I DON'T ACTUALLY USE IT IT TELLS ME IF I MEAN TOO MUCH AND I KIND OF KNOW IF I MEAN TO MUCH. ON ON THE- COMPUTER ABOUT TELL ME THAT. SO WHAT I'M REALLY DESCRIBING HERE IS SORT OF AN EVOLVING VISION FOR HOW WE CAN. EVER HEALTH CARE. AND THE WILL BE TYPICALLY DELIVER HEALTHCARE IS WE'RE ALL IN. THIS IS ROOM. FOR ALL THE HOSPITAL OR CLINIC I'M A PHYSICIAN I SEE PATIENTS. I HAPPEN TO BE A GASTROENTEROL JUST BUT WE HAVE. NOW THAT ARE INCREASINGLY ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US NOT JUST IN PERSON. BUT THROUGH ALL THESE BLUETOOTH CONNECTED DEVICES THROUGH HIPPA COMPLIANT CHANNELS. THAT THEY CAN SHARE THEIR DATA WITH US THROUGH OUR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD THE PIPES ARE THERE. IT'S A TRICK THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME TRIVIAL. THE HARD PART IS SHOULD WE BE DOING THIS HOW SHOULD WE BE DOING THIS AND SHOULD WE BE PAYING FOR SUCH A PROGRAM. BECAUSE NOW THAT PATIENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHARE ALL THE DATA WITH US THE QUESTION IS. WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THAT. AND WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO REALIZE WE NEED A NEW TYPE OF CLINICIAN. A DIGITAL AS- THE DIGITAL ESTAS LIKE THAT PICTURE FROM THE TV SHOW THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO LIVES. IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AND THE DIGITAL COMMAND CENTER WHOSE ROLE IS TO PRECISELY MONITOR PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY WITH OF COURSE THEIR- CONSENT AGREEMENT. AND TO MONITOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA BIOMETRIC PSYCHOMETRICS HOW THEY ACTUALLY FEELING. BIOMARKERS SO WE CAN MEASURE AT HOME. AND THEN TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THOSE PATIENTS WHILE THE REST OF US ARE BUSY. TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS IN PERSON. IF SOMEBODY LOOKS LIKE THEY NEED MY HELP PHYSICALLY THAT'S WHEN THE DIGITAL THIS WILL SEND THE PATIENT TO ME. RATHER THAN SOME RANDOM PERIOD OF TIME. THAT SORT OF PREDETERMINED. YOU KNOW BY MAGIC EIGHT BALL IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ACTUALLY. ENGAGE PEOPLE. WHEN THEY NEED HELP BECAUSE WITHIN TEN MILES OF HERE RIGHT NOW THERE'S UNDOUBTEDLY A CHILD WHO STARTED TO GET SHORT OF BREATH AND IS GOING TO BE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TOMORROW WITH AN ASTHMA ATTACK. WELL WHY CAN'T WE FIGURE THAT OUT RIGHT NOW AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW. AND AVOID THAT EXPENSIVE ADMISSION. THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE TERRIBLY POOR OUTCOMES WE HAVE THE- ABILITIES TO DO THIS NOW. SO THIS IS A PICTURE OF MY OWN CLINIC AT CEDAR SINAI IT. LIKE ANY OTHER CLINIC FROM NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE EXCEPT FOR THAT COMPUTER IN THE MIDDLE. THAT IS DESIGNED BY ADMINISTRATORS AND BILL FIRST. PORT AND SECTIONAL NEEDS NOT TO SUPPORT THE BIOPIC WAS. TWENTY TWENTY PATIENTS. PROVIDE US AND NOW FOR GOOD. NOT FOR COLLECTING IT WHICH IS AMEND THIS OPPORTUNITY. THERE MAY NOT BE TREATED ALL THAT WELL. AND THEN YOU LEAVE PEOPLE COME TO THIS ROOM FOR VERY TINY AMOUNTS OF TIME. BUT WHERE PEOPLE REALLY ARE IS AT WORK AT HOME AND SENIOR CENTERS AT THE PARK. IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO ENGAGE CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR HEALTHCARE WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GO BEYOND THE FOUR WALLS. OF OUR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY SITUATED ENGAGE THEM IN THEIR REAL LIVES AND THAT'S THE VISION OF DIGITAL HEALTH BROADLY. AND PRECISE DIGITAL HEALTH IN PARTICULAR. SO AGAIN GETTING TO THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS FUNDED FROM OUR STUDY OF A PATIENT COMES TO SEE ME DISAPPEARS AND COMES BACK SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS LATER. IT'S IN THE CRACKS IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OR SOMEBODY HAD A HEART ATTACK THAT NOBODY SAW COMING. AND THIS IS OPPORTUNITY FOR REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING. TO SORT OF FILL IN THE BLANKS USING THIS KIND OF. CHARACTER LIKE ERIN WHO ACTUALLY IS THAT IS HIS REAL NAME IS AN ACTOR THOUGH. CAN HE USE BIOMARKER CYCLE MARKERS ARE BIOMETRICS AND THIS IS WHAT WE STUDIED WITH RCA PM SUPPORTED THAT STUDY. IT WAS REALLY A PILOT STUDY MAINLY TO SEE IS IT EVEN FEASIBLE TO DO THIS. IS IT TECHNICALLY CAPABLE WE ARE TECHNICALLY CAPABLE OF DOING THIS AND ARE THERE ANY SINGLES IN THE NOISE THAT. WE COULD USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RATHER TYPES OF SIGNAL SEARCH ENGINES TO FIND PATTERNS THAT WOULD PREDICT SOMEBODY. WHO IS ACTUALLY GONNA GET IN TROUBLE. AND THEN WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE HEALTH ECONOMICS OF THIS CAN WE IT IS WILL IT EVER EVEN BE COST EFFECTIVE FOR THIRD PARTY PAYER TO SUPPORT SUCH A PROGRAM SO IT'S A PRETTY AMBITIOUS. PROGRAM THAT WE UNDERTOOK. AND SO WE WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA COMPANIES TO MEASURE BIOMARKERS BIOMETRICS AND PSYCHOMETRICS AND SOME OF THEM ARE LISTED THERE. DISCUSSED UP THAT BIT. OF AT THE BASE WITH. COMPANY. FORMAT THAT WE CAN USE ON A RESEARCH SIDE OR THROUGH ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. ALIVE CORE CREATES THAT SENSOR THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER. AND WE ALSO WE'RE ABLE TO WORK WITH COMPANIES NEAR TERRACE AND THERMO FISHER. THIS IS NOT THERE KNOWS THIS IS ACTUALLY FDA CLEARED TECHNOLOGY WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE BLOOD SAMPLE. AND SEND IT TO US IN THE MAIL WHERE WE CAN BE PROTEOMICS GENOMICS LIPID OMICS ON THESE BLOOD SAMPLES IT'S PRETTY. REMARKABLE WORK AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE THE SIGNAL MIGHT BE THAT'S GOING TO PREDICT. WHO'S GONNA POTENTIALLY HAVE A HEART ATTACK BEFORE IT HAPPENS. BUT WE ALSO CAN'T FORGET ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY FEEL. OF HOW PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING HEALTH PEOPLE HOWEVER THEY FEEL FATIGUE TIRED DEPRESSED SAD THESE ARE IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT ARE PART OF PRECISION MEDICINE PRECISION MEDICINE IS NOT JUST ABOUT GENOMICS. IT'S ABOUT FULLY CHARACTERIZING PATIENTS ACROSS BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL DOMAINS OF HEALTH CARE. I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN ACTUAL EXAMPLE FROM A PATIENT IN OUR STUDY THIS IS A DIRECT RESULT OF. OUR STUDY% FROM THE FUNDING THAT WE THAT WE OBTAINED. THIS IS A PATIENT WHO WAS MEASURING HIS. HIS HEART RATE. WITH THE SENSOR AND ALL THIS ON THE COMPUTER TURNED RED IT TOLD THE PATIENT SOMETHING. WAS GOING ON THAT SHOULD BE. IT ALL THE PATIENT THAT HE SHOULD PROBABLY GET A KICK CARE. AWAY HE ACTUALLY CAME INTO OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND YOU CAN SEE ELEVEN THIRTY TWO PM. THAT IS THE SENSOR FROM AT HOME AND THEN WHEN HE CAME TO SEE US. AT RIGHT TWELVE THIRTY IN THE MORNING WE FORMA. LEADING AG THAT ACTUALLY FOUND GET. INTO A- DANGEROUS RIP. AND HE WAS PARTY OVERDID ACTUALLY SHORT OF THAT OVER. AS A RESULT OF COMING IN NOW HE MAY HAVE COME IN ANYWAY DON'T KNOW BUT HE CAME IN PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THE COMPUTER TOLD HIM. THIS IS PACKED FULL. BENEFIT OF THE STUDY ITSELF. AND WHEN WE LOOK BACK IN TIME IS MORE HERE THAN I WOULD CARE TO GO THROUGH AT THE TIME THERE'S ALL SORTS OF OTHER DATA WE WERE COLLECTING. AND THE QUESTION IS CAN A COMPUTER HELP US. FIND A SIGNAL AND ALL THAT ALWAYS. WAS HE SLEEPING. MORE POORLY IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS WHETHER OTHER FACTORS IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT IF WE LOOK AT CAREFULLY. WE. CAN START TO OUT TO EVALUATE. THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY PAPER. NOW BEGIN PUBLISHES IT IS ALL OF THIS THIS IS IN JAM YEAH WHICH IS THE LEADING INFORMATICS JOURNAL. AND REALLY SHOWED IS THAT THIS IS FEASIBLE THAT THE PATIENTS IN THE STUDY WERE WILLING TO USE IN THIS CASE TO FIT THAT. OVER 90% OF THE PATIENTS IN THE STUDY WERE WILLING TO USE IT. AND THAT'S QUITE HIGHER. THAN GENERAL YOU KNOW CONSUMERS WHO ARE USING MAY BE WEARABLE DEVICES FOR HEALTH AND WELLNESS PURPOSES. WHEN A DOCTOR WORKS OF THE PATIENT AND EXPLAINS WHY WERE USING THIS. POWER COULD POTENTIALLY HELP THEM WE FIND THIS IS MY LAST SLIDE JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATED ACROSS DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES THIS IS A STUDY. THAT INVOLVED HEALTH ECONOMICS PSYCHOMETRIC SHINS BIOMETRIC SHINS. GENETICISTS INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF PEOPLE FROM UCLA FROM CEDAR SINAI. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND JUST WANT TO THANK AGAIN CA EIGHT PM FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT OUR RESULTS AND- REPRESENTATIVES ON THIS RESEARCH. THANKS FOR MAKING SO MUCH DOCTOR SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS FITBIT CAN DO MORE THAN JUST WAKE ME UP IN THE MORNING. IS THAT THAT. I'M UNDER UTILIZING THIS TECHNOLOGY. THAT I WANT TO SPEAK FOR YOU BUT IT'S POSSIBLE. OKAY. OF LET'S HEAR FROM ISABEL DORADO WILL CIRCLE BACK IDEA OF A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU DOCTOR BUT LET'S WELCOME. IS IT. ISABEL DERON SANDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE LATINO CANCER INSTITUTE AND WE WILL DO ANOTHER SWITCH OUT I BELIEVE OF SHE SLIDES. IT'S A GOOD JOURNALIST I'M HERE WITH THE SCRIPT. WHAT'S. I HAVE A SCRIPT ARE WE ON. WE ARE ON WEST MY TELEPHONE WAS TO MAKE. MY KEY LIKE THIS BUTTON. IT LOOKS GOOD NOW OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INTEREST. OF THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MULLIN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT'S REALLY A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU AND TO ALL THE GUESTS IN OUR AUDIENCE MEMBERS AS YOU MENTIONED ON THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE LATINO CANCER INSTITUTE WHICH IS A NATIONAL NETWORK OF LATINO CANCER SERVICE AGENCIES BUT I'M ALSO HERE. AS AN AWARD EAT THIS YEAR OF A C. I. A. P. M. MEDICINE GRANT. AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STANFORD CANCER INSTITUTE. I'M SPEAKING AS A COMMUNITY PARTNER IN THIS ENDEAVOR. I SPEAK AS A CANCER SURVIVOR WHO NOW SPEAKS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE A VOICE. AND I SPEAK AS A CONCERNED CITIZEN WHOSE TAXPAYER DOLLARS FUND THIS KEY INITIATIVE THAT CAN IMPACT ALL OF OUR HEALTH THAT OF OUR FAMILY OR MORE BROADLY ALL OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. A FEW YEARS AGO I RECEIVED A FACEBOOK PLEA IN SPANISH FROM THE SISTER OF A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD. A LATINO MEXICAN MAIL IN CHICAGO HE WAS BATTLING FOURTH STAGE LEUKEMIA AND HE NEEDED A TRANSPLANT COULD I HELP. FURTHER INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE SOCIAL WORKER IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THERE HAD USED ALL OF THE BAILABLE. AVENUES OPEN TO KEEP THAT YOUNG MAN ALIVE. BUT HERE IS WHAT WAS REALLY DISHEARTENING. SHE ACTUALLY HAD FOUND A CLINICAL TRIAL. THE YOUNG MAN WAS ALLOWED TO GO INTO TREATMENT ON THAT TRIAL DRUG AND AFTER A SERIES OF ROUNDS OF TREATMENTS HE WAS IN REMISSION. BUT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE TRIAL IT WAS IN A PRIVATE HOSPITAL HE DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE HE WAS BOTTOM LINE REFUSED FURTHER TREATMENT. SO I AS A SOCIAL WORKER WHAT PROBABLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE RELAPSES SHE SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO RETURN TO AROUND OF PROBABLY INEFFECTIVE CHEMO. UNLESS HE FOUND A TRANSPLANT MATCH. THAT IS THE LAST I HEARD OF THAT CASE BUT IT HAUNTS ME TO THIS DAY. ETHICS REGULATION RULES ALL SEEM WRONG HERE. IT WAS FROM THE SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS THAT THE LATINO CANCER INSTITUTE WAS BORN TO UNITE. LATINO AGENCIES AMPLIFIER VOICES INFLUENCE BOTH TREATMENT AND POLICIES THAT CHANGE CARE OUTCOMES FOR THE BETTER. TO IN FACT ADDRESSED THOSE DISPARITIES THAT INHIBIT QUALITY EQUITY AND AFFORDABLE CARE. SO I JOINED WITH STANFORD ON THE CIA PM GRANT WITH A VERY LONG TITLE THAT YOU SEE HERE IF YOU CAN EVEN READ IT. A NEW PRECISION MEDICINE FOR THE EYES NOW DOCTOR. LED BY ONCOLOGIST MANALI PATEL IN OUR PREVENTION SCIENTIST LISO GOLDMAN RUSSIA SO FROM STANFORD. I RECALL I ACTUALLY RECALL FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN'S CALLED ARMS TO BRING PRECISION MEDICINE. TO EVERY CALIFORNIANS. WE FOCUSED ON SALINAS AND MONTEREY COUNTY WHERE 60% OF THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS ARE LATINO. PRETTY RATE IS 18% IS CONSIDERED OBESE AND 12% SMOKE. SO THESE WERE THE MARCHING ORDERS THAT I ACTUALLY HEARD FROM THE CALL FOR PROPOSAL FOR THE CIA PM. INTRODUCED PRECISION MEDICINE INTERVENTION AND THE LOW INCOME UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. MAKE THE STUDY OUTCOMES REPLICABLE SHARE THE DATA SHOW THE PROJECT TO SAVE THE MONEY AND LIVES CONSIDER POLICIES THAT MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE AND ADDRESS DISPARITIES JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF THINGS. TO DO THAT WE DECIDED TO LOOK AT PRECISION MEDICINE INTERVENTIONS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM FROM PREVENTION WHICH IS WHERE I BELIEVE IT SHOULD START AND NOT IN THE FOURTH STAGE TUMOR. OF PREVENTION EDUCATION AND SCREENING THROUGH DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT THROUGH SURVIVORSHIP IN END OF LIFE UTILIZING AND MEASURING THE ADDED VALUE OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS CHW WAS WHICH IS ONE ANSWER TO THE WORK FORCE DIVERSITY PIPELINE. AT LEAST IN MY ESTIMATION SO WE LOOK AT MONTEREY COUNTY SO PROFILE WE LOOK AT LATINOS AGAINST NON WHITE HIS NON HISPANIC WHITES IN TERMS OF LONG BREAST COLORECTAL PROSTATE WHICH IS WHERE THE GRANT ASKED US TO FOCUS. AND WE FOUND THE LATINOS RANK LOWER IN ALL OF THESE CATEGORIES EXCEPT PROSTATE CANCER. SO THEN WE LOOKED OUTSIDE THE NORM. AND HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND THE DISPARITIES HERE. BESIDES PROSTATE STOMACH LIVER PANCREAS AND CERVIX ALL RANKED HIGHER NOT JUST IN MONTEREY COUNTY AGAINST NON HISPANIC WHITES BUT AGAINST ALL OF CALIFORNIA. SO THIS IS WHERE THE DISPARITIES LIE AND THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE SAMPLING TESTING IN ANY INTERVENING. YEP THE GENETIC TESTS PANELS AGAINST WE HAVE TO MEASURE HAVE FIFTEEN VARIANCE BASED ON MAINSTREAM POPULATIONS WERE MISSING A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE. I HAD TESTIFIED AT THE HEARING AT UCLA LAST YEAR THAT IN ORDER TO BRING PRECISION MEDICINE TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY NEEDED TO GO THROUGH DISPARITIES. AND WE HAD TO THE DRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS THE BARRIERS LIKE LOW INCOME AND LANGUAGE AND ACCESS DISPARITIES THAT INCLUDED UNDER RESOURCE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE AND CLINICS SYSTEMS WHOSE CLINICIANS. ARE EQUALLY CHALLENGED BY WHAT TO DO WITH PRECISION MEDICINE WHERE TO ORDER TESTS HOW TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY MEAN HOW TO GET THE PRESCRIBED TREATMENT HOW TO GET THE COSTS COVERED BY PAY YOURS IN INSURERS. AND GIVEN THIS THESE BARRIERS IN THESE CHALLENGE HOW DO WE EVEN BEGAN TO DISCOVER THE VARIANCE ORPHAN GENES THAT MIGHT BE PARTICULAR. ELLIS SO THAT WE CAN IN FACT ADD TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE TESTING AND DISCOVERY. WHEN THE PROJECT TEAM LAUNCHED THE FIRST MEETING OF THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD JUST THIS LAST FRIDAY IN SALINAS WE DID AN INSTANT POLL AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE ASKED OF THEM WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT IMPACT CANCER IN MONTEREY COUNTY. AND THIS WORD CLOUD IF YOU CAN SEE A G. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE BIGGER THAN THIS BUT THE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT ACCESS AND SOCIO ECONOMIC OR COST WERE THE TWO STANDOUTS TWO MAJOR BARRIERS TO QUALITY INEQUITABLE CARE THAT IMPACT LOW INCOME RESIDENTS NOT JUST IN MONTEREY. COUNTY BUT ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN I HOSTED THE FIFTH BI ANNUAL NATIONAL AT THE NO CANCER SOME OF THE FOCUS WAS PRECISION MEDICINE WE SAW IT COMING WE KNEW WE HAD TO ENGAGE WE DIDN'T. WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THAT WAS GOING TO MEAN FOR OUR POPULATIONS AND MOST OF THE THREE HUNDRED RESEARCHERS AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES WHO WERE THERE MOST OF THEM 70% LATINO CAME IN VERY SKEPTICAL CONCERNED THAT PRECISION MEDICINE WOULD IN FACT INDEED EXACERBATE OUR DISPARITIES THEY LEFT WITH A COMMITMENT TO FIND OUT HOW TO INCLUDE. THESE APPLICATIONS WITHIN THEIR WORK BUT THERE'S A LONG ROAD BETWEEN INTENTION AND POSITIVE OUTCOMES BIOTECHNOLOGY AND PRECISION MEDICINE ARE CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE PROMISING FOR MANY COMMUNITIES IF CALIFORNIANS UNDERSTAND IT IF THEY ACCEPTED IF THEY DON'T FEAR IT IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IT WHERE THEY CAN GET THERE AND IF THEY CAN AFFORD. AS A MEMBER INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD ALL OF US RESEARCH PROGRAM AT THE NATIONAL TUBES OF HELP I'VE BEEN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN I HAVE VIEWED CATIONS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING FROM CALIFORNIA FROM MAJOR ACADEMIC. IT TOO SINCE THE SOURCE WAS THAT IT WOULD. TRANSIT. LEONARD'S FEDERALLY QUALIFIED CLINICS TO BIOINFORMATICS PROPOSALS AND BIG BUSINESS. TO ME THE WEAKEST AND OR MISSING LINK WAS A STRONG COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PLAN THAT SHOWED THEY UNDERSTOOD THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN ABSENT FOR RESEARCH AND CLINICAL TRIALS. PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES WITH LANGUAGE LOW LITERACY AND HISTORIES OF ABUSE OF RESEARCH. AND AS I AM RE REVIEWED SOME OF THESE APPLICATIONS IN THEIR SECOND AND THIRD YEARS THESE APPLICANTS HAVE SHOWN IN FACT THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED THE HARD WAY. THEY HAVE LEARNED TO FINALLY REACH INTO THESE COMMUNITIES AND FIND PARTNERS ESTABLISHING TRUST AND BUILDING BRIDGES. SO I GOT BOLD AND I GOT BRILLIANT AND I CAME UP WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS COMMITTEE WANTS TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD IN BIOTECH AND PRECISION MEDICINE YOU HAVE GOT TO START INVESTING IN THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES IN AGENCIES THAT WORK WITH THE UNDERSERVED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THEY CAN PLAY A PART IN DIMINISHING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. FIRST OF ALL I SAY CREATE A PEOPLE FUND FOR EVERY TEN DOLLARS THAT YOU INVEST IN BIOTECH RESEARCH FOR ONE DOLLAR IN THE PEOPLE FUND. OF SOMEONE LIKE THE CALIFORNIA BREAST CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT YOU MIGHT BE REFER A FAMILIAR WITH THAT GETS OUT TOBACCO TAX DOLLARS I'M FACT SAT ON THEIR COMMITTEE FOR A LONG TIME IT'S A FABULOUS PROGRAM CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER DOLLARS SHOULD GO BACK INTO COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT GAP EDUCATION BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE START. TEACHING UNDERSTANDING OF GENETICS DOCTORS FOR ACCESS TO GENETIC TESTING GENETIC COUNSELING IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND THE TRAINING OF CULTURAL HE AND LINGUIST. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO HELP NAVIGATE THE COMMUNITY. PATIENTS WHO ARE ALL RIGHT WE'RE ALL PATIENTS WE ONLY NAVIGATING AT SOME POINT HELP NAVIGATE THROUGH THROUGH THIS. THIS NEW UP PLACE THIS NEW KIND OF MEDICINE ARE SO THAT THEY CAN DO WELL IN THESE PUBLIC CARE SYSTEMS. AND MY SECOND RUN RECOMMENDATION IS CREATE A PUBLIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE A PUBLIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE. TO A REWARD THOSE DOLLARS TO COMMUNITY AGENCIES WHO CAN DELIVER THE ABOVE SERVICES OR INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO DO SO WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH ACADEMIC PARTNERS TO DEVELOP A VALUATION PLANS. AND MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS BOUGHT INVEST. THE POWER IN THE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS TO DO TO BECOME ENGAGED YOU CANNOT HAVE ALL OF THIS BRILLIANT MEDICINE IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE PEOPLE WITH YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT SO I'M DIGESTING THAT EVEN IS AS WE SPEAK. I GUESS I'M STRUCK THAT CREATING A ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PLAN SOUNDS LIKE IT OUGHT TO BE A NO BRAINER. IN THIS DAY AND AGE BUT DO I LIKE YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT. AND CERTAINLY THERE'S A THERE'S A DOLLARS COMPONENT TO THIS AND DIRECTING THOSE DOLLARS APPROPRIATELY WITH UP THAT WAS UP IN MIND IN TERMS OF ACCESS BROADLY AVAILABLE ACROSS A SOCIOECONOMIC BARRIERS ARE AT THE SOCIO ECONOMIC AREAS SO IN TERMS OF LEGAL OR REGULATORY BARRIERS YOU MENTIONED. YOU MENTIONED. THE VARIANCE FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION AS OPPOSED TO SAY A LEAD LATINO POPULATION A THESE VARIANTS ARE ARE TAKEN FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION WHICH CAN ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING OF A DISADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF A WHAT THOSE RESULTS MIGHT BE CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT JUST. A LITTLE MORE SO I COULD BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO AFFECT THAT AS A LEGISLATURE OKAY SO NOW YOU'RE ASKING ME TO PUT ON A SCIENCE HAND. SO I'M GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES HERE TO CHIME IN IF I MESS UP. OF BOTTOM LINE. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN RESEARCH DONE ON HOME WE HAVE INFORMATION ARE ARE NON HISPANIC WHITE. SO WE HAVE UNDER OF RESEARCH COMMUNITIES AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO AND ASIAN OF. POPULATIONS AND IN FACT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE THAT THE ALL OF US RESEARCH PROGRAM WAS MEANT TO ADDRESS IT WAS TO IN FACT BRING IN THESE LARGE GROUPS OF UNDER RESEARCH TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF. WE KNEW WE WERE GONNA LEARN MORE FROM THEM IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TREAT BROADER A SCOPE OF DISEASES. INSTEAD OF JUST DEPENDENT ON THESE PARTICULAR I'M NOT SAYING THERE AREN'T THERE ISN'T DATA OUT THERE I READ SOME LAB IS GOT SOMETHING LIKE A- FIVE CONTINENTS AND- SIX HUNDRED KINDS. THEY HAVE A LAB FULL OF PEOPLE'S AS SAMPLES. BUT WHERE WE'RE TESTING. AND WHAT WE'RE TESTING AGAINST THEY HAVE LIMITED SAMPLES AND THOSE SAMPLES ARE TAKEN FROM NON HISPANIC WHITES MORE TRADITIONALLY SO I'M SAYING IF THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN DISEASES. OR DIFFERENT OR DISEASES THAT ACTUALLY IMPACT% MORE IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY HOW DO WE FIND THAT OUT IF WE CAN'T MEASURE. OUR TO SELL OUR BIO SPECIMENS AGAINST OF AGAINST THE POPULAR UP THE POPULATION WHERE THE CELLS OF AND THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE THE DATA YOU HAVE. SO IT'S JUST SAYING WE'RE TRYING TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD OF KNOWLEDGE SO THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE RIGHT ANSWERS I THINK RENDON HAS DONE A LOT OF THAT WORK AND POSSIBLY EVEN. ADD SOMETHING SMART. I'M NOT A GENETICIST SO I DON'T SPEAK OUT OF TURN I THINK IN GENERAL YOU'RE SAYING THE NORMATIVE SENT SAMPLES MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GENERAL. POPULATION SEE I TOLD YOU HE WOULD SAY. DID DID I MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU. MISTER MILLER. WITH SEVEN SO THAT I MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU YES YOU DID OKAY ABSOLUTELY I WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT I INTRODUCED MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER BILL QUIRK FROM THE EAST BAY. LONG STANDING MEMBER OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE ABOUT TECH WOULD WELCOME ANY COMMENTS AT THE OUTSET. WELL CERTAINLY THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING. FIELDS AND- IN A REAL IMPORTANT SUPPORT. OF OUR BAY AREA COMMUNITY SAN DIEGO LA AT CETERA. I IS THIS BIOTECH INDUSTRY. HAS A LOT TO GIVE US I'M CERTAINLY AWARE. THAT AS YOU WERE DISCUSSING THAT. OUR GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS VARY A LOT IF YOU TAKE THEM FROM ONE PARTICULAR GROUP IT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ANOTHER GROUP SHALL WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. THANK YOU. AS DOCTOR BILL QUIRK LITERALLY A NUCLEAR SCIENTIST AND OFFICIALLY ASTROPHYSICISTS ARE. I KNEW IT I KNEW SOMETHING LIKE THAT I KNOW NUCLEAR SIGN. AND ROCKET SCIENCE SO ON THE ISSUE DOCTOR AS SPIEGEL OF. BOB DIGITAL MONITORING. IN AN ESSENTIALLY AT YOU DIDN'T PUT IN THESE TERMS ABOUT PREVENTING FOLKS FROM GOING TO THE HOSPITAL BUT ESSENTIALLY THERE'S THIS TRACK OVER HERE WHICH IS DIGITAL MODERATE REMOTE MONITORING OR GOING IN THIS YEAR. AMERICAN POSITION. WHO MAKES THE CALL. ON WHETHER SOMETHING CAN BE HANDLED REMOTELY OR ITS- THE KIND OF HEALTH SITUATION THAT OUGHT TO BE SEEN BY A. DR THE PERSON RIGHT SO I THINK WITH PARTLY BEHIND THE QUESTION IS DIGITAL HEALTH IS NOT A COMPUTER SCIENCE IS NOT AN ENGINEERING SCIENCE IT'S REALLY A SOCIAL SCIENCE AT THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS TECHNOLOGY. REQUIRE SHARED DECISION MAKING BETWEEN PATIENTS AND THEIR PROVIDERS IT ALSO REQUIRES HAVING PROGRAMS THAT ARE RELIABLE THEIR EVIDENCE BASE AND THAT ARE COST EFFECTIVE SO THERE'S A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT HAVE TO PHONE LINE FOR ANY DECISION TO BE MADE. NOW WHERE MOST OF THE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE IS AROUND HI PROBLEMS CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES LIKE A HEART DISEASE EXAMPLE THAT I PROVIDED TODAY OR FOR HIGH STAKES SITUATIONS LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTED FOR TRANSPLANTATION OR REALLY UNDERSTANDING THEY'RE- NOT JUST DAY TO DAY BUT SOME CASES MINUTES MINUTE VARIATIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CLINICAL CARE. SO AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEMATIC ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION IT'S REALLY STILL IN EXPERIMENTAL PURSUIT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SO MUCH EVIDENCE NOW THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS THE QUESTION IS EXACTLY HOW SHOULD WE BE DOING THIS WHO'S IN CHARGE OF MAKING THIS THESE DECISIONS SO NOT REALLY ANSWERING A QUESTION I DON'T THINK DIRECTLY. OTHER THAN POSING MORE QUESTIONS WHICH MAYBE IS A SIGN OF A QUESTION I THINK THERE'S A LOT A LOT ANSWER TO REALLY ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. AND I WILL. POSE TO YOU. DOCTOR SPIEGEL A SIMILAR QUESTION AROUND LEGAL REGULATORY BARRIERS MEAN THE- VERY CLEARLY THERE IS A FINANCIAL COMPONENT HERE AND P. R. THE STATE. IS STEPPING UP. THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BE A PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM OUR NEXT PANEL ABOUT. IS THE INDUSTRY AND FRANKLY ECONOMIC AND INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN THIS SECTOR. WHICH IN TERMS OF WHAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO ENABLE. YOU ALL TO DO THE WORK THAT YOU DO OR TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT STEP. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE OUGHT TO BE. FOCUSING ON A MATTER FIRST PANEL FRANKLY. AND THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN IN THESE HEARINGS BUT THERE ARE VERY CLEARLY A COUPLE OF LEGISLATIVE IDEAS. THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN WORK ON ACTIVELY AND MOVE. BUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS JUST FROM YOUR- PERSPECTIVE THAT WE OUGHT TO BE. MORE COGNIZANT OF IN TERMS OF BARRIERS THAT EXISTS IN OUR STATE. SO MANY BARRIERS ANY PART OF IT. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO KNOW. LEGISLATIVELY HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN SOME OF IT IS REGULATORY REALLY MORE. FEDERAL FDA CLEARANCE OF DEVICES FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THAT MANY OF THE- COMPANIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE STRUGGLING WITH A WE A HEALTH AND WELLNESS COMPANY. OR RE TRYING TO CREATE MEDICAL GRADE PRODUCTS AND COMPANIES ARE REALLY DIVIDING UP INSTITUTE. IT REALLY HELPS. TO LIVE FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANY FDA CLEARED APPLE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN WITH FTA CLEAR DEVICES SO PART OF IT IS REALLY FEDERAL REGULATIONS MAKING IT EASIER TO OBTAIN CLEARANCE WITH PREDICATE DEVICES AND THERE'S A WHOLE. THERE'S A WHOLE SORT OF LITERATURE AROUND HOW BEST TO APPROACH THAT. WITHIN CALIFORNIA I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS AS REALLY TRAINING PEOPLE FOR THIS NEW REALITY. WHETHER IT'S IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS DO WE NEED A NEW TYPE OF DISCIPLINE DO WE NEED TO TRAIN DIGITAL LIST OF ANY CHANGE THE CURRICULUM. IN THE UC SYSTEM I HAPPENED TO RUN A GRADUATE PROGAM FOCUSED EXACTLY ON THIS TOPIC WE ACTUALLY ARE TRAINING TOMORROW'S HEALTHCARE LEADERS IN THE NEW ERA. OF DIGITAL HEALTH AND ALSO COMBINING IT WITH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HEALTH ECONOMICS UNDERSTANDING THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND I THINK THERE'S- A LITERACY GAP IN THAT AREA WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE TRAINED UNDERSTAND POLICY. UNDERSTAND HEALTH ECONOMICS AND UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE AND BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER TO REALLY MAKE SMART DECISIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH OUR MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAM. BUT I WISH I HAD A MORE PRECISE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. NOT I WELCOME IT AND IT'S- YOU KNOW MUCH OF THIS IS NEW EMERGING INFORMATION I'M I'M TRYING TO. LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN I MENTION TO A GROUP. WHO WAS HERE EARLIER THIS IS VERY MUCH YEAH WE ARE GENERALISTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ASTROPHYSICIST WHERE ARE OFTEN GENERALISTS. IT IS BUILDING. AND THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A GAP ON THAT SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE. THE FRONT ANSWER TRANSLATING THAT INTO YOU KNOW HOW DO WE TURN THIS INTO PUBLIC POLICY THAT CAN MOVE THESE THINGS. FORWARD AND IT IT JUST OBSTRUCT YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION AROUND TECHNOLOGY WEARABLE TECH. THAT DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND SO FOR JUST THAT THE- THE- GEOGRAPHY OF CALIFORNIA ALONE PRESENTS. CHALLENGES IN THIS REGARD AND- RURAL HEALTH CARE AND WORK FORCE ARE ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW TOUCH. HEALTHCARE AND OF RIGHTY EVER ARENA SO JUST THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA NATALIE ETHNICALLY CULTURALLY GEOGRAPHICALLY. JUST OUR SERVICE SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH MAKE CALIFORNIA'S A RICHER ACTUALLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ALSO. A PREVENT CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF SERVICE DELIVERY AND WE OUGHT TO BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TAKE ALL OF THAT. INTO ACCOUNT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCESS FOR EVERYONE ACROSS THE STATE ITSELF. I THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR YES YES I THINK THIS IS REALLY CRUCIAL BECAUSE THIS. MIGHT AT SOME POINT IN TIME ALSO GO TO REGULATION AND OTHER POLICIES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER. BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE SCIENCE SIDE BUT WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS GO BACK AND LOOK AT IT FROM THE CONSUMER COMMUNITY SIDE. THERE IS EVEN FROM MY CHAIR AT THE I. R. B. WITH THERE IS A GROWING CONSUMER MOVEMENT ABOUT WHO OWNS MY DATA. AND WHO HAS PERMISSION TO USE MY DATA AND WHEN THEY USE IT WHAT DO I GET FROM IT. AND SO I MEAN THERE'S EVEN AN ORGANIZATION CALLED CITIZENS WHICH IS DEEP TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO GET CONTROL OF THEIR DATA AND WHAT THEYCAN DO WITH IT. OF AND OF COURSE FIRST QUESTION IS ALWAYS DO YOU HAVE THAT IN SPANISH BUT- I THINK THAT. YOU IS LEGISLATORS. NEED TO BE THAT CONSUMERS ARE START IN. GIVEN ALL OF THE EXPOSURES GIVEN. PACKING GIVEN EVERYTHING THE CONSUMERS SHINS ADVOCATES ALL BECOMING VERY WHERE THAT THEIR DATA IS VALUABLE AND WHAT'S IN IT THEY WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME SYNDROME YES THEY WANT TO HELP BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO CONTROL TO SOME EXTENT SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO CREATE THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT CONSENT IN. AND CONSENT IN AT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND NOT JUST ONE SIGN OFF OF TEN PAGES OF MEDICAL JARGON IT'S REALLY CRUCIAL TO START THINKING ON THAT LEVEL. THAT COURT JUST TO THAT EFFECT NOW WE'VE HD A CELL LINE THAT WAS DEVELOPED WAY BACK WHEN IN THE SIXTIES. AND THE WOMAN NEVER KNEW THAT ARE CELLS WERE TAKEN THAT THEY WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY HENRIETTA LACKS YES EXACTLY WOMAN NEVER KNEW THAT OUR SHELLS WERE TAKEN. HER DESCENDANTS THAN SOME FIFTY YEARS LATER BEING TOLD THAT THEY WERE TAKEN HAVE THEY WERE USED AND. IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO SCIENCE THIS IS VERY DISTURBING SO. YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TO YOUR BODY WHICH CAN BE SAMPLED AND PERHAPS IS IMPORTANT FOR SCIENCE. YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO HAVE. A VERY STRONG CONSENT AND THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION IF SOMEBODY'S MAKING MONEY OFF IT DO YOU GET MONEY BACK. THESE ARE ALL QUESTIONS THAT THAT PEOPLE NEED TO GET ANSWERS TO AND THAT WAS WHY PROPOSED THE PEOPLE FUND NOT SO PART OF THE ANY OF THE WE GOT ALL THE REVENUES OR ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO COME BACK TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND HOW THEY WANT TO. I JUST THINK IF YOU SHOW IF YOU SHOW THERE'S EQUITY AND IF YOU CHAU THERE'S ENGAGEMENT IT'S NOT TRYING TO RUN AWAY WITH YOUR STUFF BUT IN FACT TO SHARE IT WITH YOU FOR THE GREATER GOOD I THINK MOST PEOPLE RESPOND THAT WAY BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAVE. LOOKED AT. AND I THINK YOU LOOK VERY SMART. PUBLIC IF YOU. LEAD THE CHARGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS ABOUT IRAN DR THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH I'M SORRY THIS BEFORE YOU BEFORE YOU DEPART JUST A QUICK MISS WALDRON CLOSING YOU KNOW WHEN WE DEAL WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT ISSUES REGARDING HEALTH IT KIND OF COMES DOWN TO EVENTUALLY THAT THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IS REALLY THE FIRST LINE OF CONTACT. YOU KNOW WITH THE PATIENT AND- LOSE SOME OF THE THINGS WE DEAL WITH IN THE LEGISLATURE IS. YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE GET. MORE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TO BE AWARE OF BECAUSE THEY'RE SO BUSY THEY'RE SEEING YOU KNOW SO MANY PATIENTS THEY DON'T HAVE TIME ALL THE TIME. TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THE THINGS AND YOU KNOW NO ONE REALLY DOES IT'S JUST THE MOVING ALL THE TIME THAT'S WHY WITH THE NAVIGATORS. TO HELP YOU KNOW EVEN JUST. TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE SYSTEM AS IT IS. BUT YOU KNOW WE DEAL WITH TRYING TO INSTITUTE NEW CURRICULUM FOR PRIMARY CARE OR ONGOING TRAININGFOR PHYSICIANS. AND WE ALWAYS HIT THE STUMBLING BLOCK OF WHAT WE CAN'T. MANDATE THE MEDICAL BORDER WE CAN YOU KNOW WE CAN. RECOMMEND YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT THOUGH. HOW DO WE BRING IN THE MEDICAL BOARD SO THAT THEY'RE UP TO DATE ON ALL OF THIS. IT SEEMS TO BE WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING DOCTORS KIND OF CAME TO MIND THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE. SEVEN MOMENT OUT THE PREACHER VERY BRIEFLY I MEAN I HAVE TO BE AN ASSISTANT DEAN AT THE DAVID GEFFEN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT UCLA AND YOU KNOW TRAINING PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR ALL OF US IN AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS. THAT'S WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD WITH HEALTH CARE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S FOR ACCESS BEGINS AND WE'RE LOSING SO MANY QUALITY STUDENTS. PARTICULAR FROM THE BAY AREA STANFORD FOR RECESS SOME OF THE STUDENTS ARE LEAVING MEDICINE COMPLETELY AND GOING TO WORK FOR START UP COMPANIES AND THERE'S LIKE A BRAIN DRAIN IN A WAY FOR SOME OF THE VERY BEST PARTICULAR UP HERE AND MY THOUGHT IS. WE NEED TO REDEFINE PRIMARY CARE AS THE PIONEERING SPECIAL TO WHERE THEY ARE THESE ALL THESE THINGS I TALKED TO TODAY ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES THEY- SHOULD READ I DON'T. RECALL SOME OF THESE GREAT STUDENT. AND FEEL LIKE A AVE CAN ACTUALLY USE THEIR SKILLS AND PROGRAMMING AND DIGITAL LITERACY AND IMPLEMENT THEM IN IN WAYS THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY EXISTS THAT'S WHY WE REALLY. DO NEED TO COME AROUND DID HEALTH AND THE NEW SPECIALIST PROBLEM. CALLED THE DIGITAL AND THAT IN BACK. A LOT OF INTEREST IN. ARENA ONE THINGS WERE TO DO WITH OUR GRANT IS EVEN AS WE'RE TRYING TO EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY WERE ALSO TRYING TO EDUCATE THE CLINIC FOR THE POSITIONS. AND THE CLINICIANS SO THAT THEY CAN SPEAK TOGETHER AGAIN SO YES AND WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. WHAT OCCURRED BECAUSE I BUT I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MAYBE WE NEED TO BRING THEM IN AS A- IS ONE OF OUR VICE PARTNERS. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY GREAT THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. AND WE WILL TRANSITION TO OUR FINAL AGENDA ITEM. DR LORI DOCTOR LAURA JULIAN FROM. MY HOME TOWN COMPANY GENENTECH. INDUCTOR ELEANOR DUFF FROM ASTRAZENECA ALSO WITH A PRESENCE IN SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US TODAY AND WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE LIFE SCIENCES INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE AND- WITH SOME OF THAT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FROM AN ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STANDPOINT ARE. SPECIFIC TO PRECISION MEDICINE SO THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE I THINK NOT SURE IF WE HAVE A. NO DECKS TO LOAD HERE. EXCELLENT SO WE'LL START WITH DOCTOR LORD JULIAN GENENTECH PRECISION MEDICINE FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS TO ASSEMBLYMAN MULLIN AND THIS COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND TO NOT TACK I SUPPORT RESEARCH AIM TO UNDERSTAND HOW DISEASES OF ALL OF HOW TO ADVANCE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND IMPORTANTLY HOW OUR MEDICINES CAN BE USE MOST APPROPRIATELY. I'M ALSO THE GENETIC LEAD FOR A PROGRAM THAT'S CALLED PROJECT FLOOD LIGHT SO ON MY NUMBER OF OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE THIS TO TRY TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL AND PRECISION MEDICINE I'M A TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. OUR ASPIRATION IN THIS AREA WE'VE DONE A PROJECT WHEN QUIRK COLLABORATION WITH UCSF AND SUTTER HEALTH RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND DISSEMINATION GROUP AND THIS WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE CIA PM. SO FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS GENENTECH IS A MEMBER OF THE ROAD GROUP HAS BEEN A LEADING BY A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY DEDICATED TO THE PURSUIT OF SCIENCE TO ADDRESS UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS FOR THOSE WITH SERIOUS AND LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS GENENTECH HAS ITS U. S. CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO WHICH OF COURSE IS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONCE DISTRICT. AND WE AIM TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE SCIENCE WITH OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND A PRODUCT PORTFOLIO OF OVER FORTY FDA APPROVED MEDICINES INCLUDING THOSE. THAT TREAT CANCER HEMOPHILIA AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. I MASSES AN INTERESTING CONNECTION IT OFTEN STRIKES IN THE PRIME OF LIFE WHEN PEOPLE ARE STARTING THEIR CAREERS. STARTING THEIR FAMILIES IT'S A LEADING CAUSE OF NEUROLOGIC DISABILITY AMONG YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED ADULTS. I'M IT IS AT MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY AND FIFTY. IT AFFECTS MORE WOMEN WOMEN THAN MEN AND IT'S A CHRONIC LIFELONG DISEASE. WE THINK THAT ABOUT. ONE MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN THE U. S. LIVE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND PERHAPS THAT LENDS TO ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND. INDIVIDUALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT MASS. IMPORTANTLY IN THE SPIRIT OF AWARENESS WE THINK THIS BODY FOR SUPPORTING THE SENATE RESOLUTION EIGHTY SIX. BY SENATOR JERRY HILL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT PROCLAIMS MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH IN PERPETUITY AS PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DAY. SO MS CAN IMPACT ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS OF OUR DAILY LIFE THAT THIS INCLUDES WALKING COORDINATION HAND FUNCTION THINKING SKILLS AND VISION. THE PROGRESSION THE SEVERITY OR THE IMPACT OF THIS DISEASE WILL DIFFER FROM PATIENT TO PATIENT AND CANNOT YET BE PREDICTED. SO WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES AND HOW WE TREAT EN MASSE EXISTING TOOLS TO MEASURE THE DISEASE HAVE NOT ADVANCED IN DECADES. SO THE TOOLS THAT DO EXIST TEND TO REMAIN IN THE RESEARCH DOMAIN AND FEW OF THEM MAKE IT INTO THE CLINIC OR VIEW OF THE MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO THE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS. MS PATIENTS ALSO TEND TO VISIT THEIR NEUROLOGIST. PERHAPS ONCE OR TWICE A YEARSOMETIMES FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES SO I GIVE THE NEUROLOGIST LIMITATION AND REALLY APPRECIATING THE FULL SCOPE. OF THEIR FUNCTIONING THE FULL SCOPE OF HOW THIS DISEASE IMPACT THEIR LIFE. SO IN RESPONSE TO THESE CHALLENGES ARE TEAM AFTER SELVES. WHAT IF WE COULD BETTER DETECT EARLY SIGNS OF PROGRESSION BEFORE PATIENT BECOMES DISABLED. WHAT IF WE COULD CAPTURE CHANGES IN COORDINATION OR WALKING ABILITY BEFORE THAT PATIENT MIGHT NEED. A CANE OR WALKER OR EVEN A WHEELCHAIR. SO THIS INFORMATION WHAT'S SUPPORT PROVIDER TO RECOGNIZE PROGRESSION IT WOULD GIVE THEM A GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND THEY PERHAPS SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO PURSUE THE BEST TREATMENT POSSIBLE. THIRTY CHRIS SEDATE TALKED ABOUT DIGITAL TOOLS IN THE PROMISE OF THESE TOOLS SO I THINK THIS TOPIC IS TIMELY DIGITAL MEDICINE REFERS TO THE TOOLS THAT SUPPORT HEALTH RSEARCH BUT ALSO THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. THESE TOOLS CAN BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH A SMART WATCH SMARTPHONE OR OTHER WEARABLES THAT WITHOUT REALLY ARE TODAY. LATE IN THE DIGITAL TOOLS AN ACT THAT'S AND RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT IT'S DELIVERED ON A SMARTPHONE. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO MONITOR AND MASS RELATED DISEASE PROGRESSION AND DISABILITY OVER TIME. IT'S DESIGNED TO DO THIS IN BETWEEN CLINIC VISITS TO GIVE PATIENTS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR OWN DISEASE. AND GIVE THE PATIENT THE ABILITY TO TRACK THEIR OWN I MUST OVER TIME. AND SHARE THEIR RESULTS WITH WHOM THEY'D LIKE TO THERE COULD BE THEIR HEALTHCARE TEAM IT COULD BE THEIR PROVIDER CAN BE THERE CARE PARTNERS. IN A FEW MINUTES FOR MY CHIPS CAN BE USED TO MEASURE COGNITION UPPER CHARITY FUNCTION IN WALKING. THESE ARE FUNCTIONS THAT WERE CHOSEN TO MEASURE BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPACTED BY A MASS. THE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE DOCTOR TO MEASURE THEIR FEASIBLY MEASURED BY THE DEVICE AND THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT OF PATIENTS WHEN WE SEE DECLINES IN THESE AREAS. THOSE ARE THE PATIENTS THE TEND TO LEAVE THE WORK FORCE FOR EXAMPLE. OBVIOUS YOUR HAND FUNCTION. TO THE- THAT'S A RISK FOR WHO MIGHT AND THEN HAVE PROBLEMS ON THE JOB. AND MAY AND MAY THEN HAVE HAVE MORE PROBLEMS WORKING. THERE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AT LEAST HEALTH RELATED APPS. VERY FEW OF THEM MAKE IT FROM DEVELOPMENT IN THIS TECHNOLOGY SECTOR. INTO A CLINIC. THE TECHNOLOGIES COURSE MUST SOLVED A PROBLEM FOR THE PATIENT. BUT THEY ALSO MUST SOLVE A PROBLEM FOR THE WORK FORCE OR THE WORK FLOW OF A PROVIDER. AND ALSO HEALTH SYSTEM. SO THAT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GENENTECH AS WE DEVELOP THIS APP. TO PARTNER WITH CENTER HEALTH OF THIS PROJECT. REALLY ALLOWS FOR US. TO WORK AS TWO TEAMS TO CO CREATE THE SOLUTION. AND PERHAPS ENSURE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO REAL WORLD CARE. HEALTH IS MADE REALLY INCREDIBLE STRIDES IN INCORPORATING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE NEUROLOGY CARE THEY'VE DEVELOPED A PLATFORM THAT'S CALLED NEURO SHARE AND IT'S REALLY IT'S SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE A ONE STOP VISUALIZATION. OF THE INFORMATION A DOCTOR NEEDS TO MAKE A DECISION IT MIGHT HAVE THEIR BRAIN MRI MIGHT HAVE THEIR TREATMENT RESULTS AND THE VISION IS THAT BLOOD LIKE DATA CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THAT PLATFORM. SO THAT AFTER CAN MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON CLINICAL DATA DIAGNOSTIC DATA BUT ALSO PATIENT CENTERED REAL WORLD DATA. ULTIMATELY THIS COULD PROVIDE A MORE HOLISTIC VIEW. IT BECOMES A MODEL FOR BETTER DATA IT'S NOT. BETTER DATA IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN MORE DATA IT'S REALLY MAKING THAT DATA MORNING MEANINGFUL. OUR FIRST STEP IN THE PROGRAM WAS TO INTEGRATE INTO THE CLINIC AND GET FEEDBACK WE NEEDED TO HEAR FROM PATIENTS WHETHER WORDS WAS THIS TOOL REASONABLE WHETHER FEASIBLE WAS IT ACCEPTABLE. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE COULD ENSURE THAT PATIENTS UNDERSTOOD THE WHY. WHY WOULD WE WANT YOU TO DO THIS THE HOUSE BEHIND THE TOOL AND WE'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE NEUROLOGIST AS WELL. SO THE CI A PM PROVIDED THE FUNDING TO DEVELOP AND TEST NUR SHARE AND ALSO TO START TO INTEGRATE FLOOD LIGHT INTO THIS PICTURE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLOOD LIGHT IS SUPPORTED BY A GLOBAL PROGRAM AND RUSHED IN AND TACK IT'S ACTIVE IN MORE THAN THIRTY COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN CLINICAL TRIALS. TO FULLY VALIDATE ALL THE PARTNERSHIP WAS THAT OUR HEALTH IS THE FIRST COLLABORATION IN THE WORLD. A TEST THE VALUE OF THIS TOOL SO AT THE END OF THE DAY. WELL NO NOT ONLY THAT THIS TEST IS VALID. BUT THAT IT'S RELEVANT RIGHT AND SO. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF INITIATIVES NECESSARY TO BRING AN INNOVATIVE PILOT. INTO A SCALABLE HEALTH CARE SOLUTION. THIS COLLABORATION WAS BEEN CONSIDERED BY OUR GLOBAL ORGANIZATION AS A BEST PRACTICE. IT BRINGS TOGETHER INDUSTRY HEALTH SYSTEMS IN ACADEMIA TO CREATE A BESTING CLASS HEALTH. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AT GENENTECH WE IMPROVE HOW WE MEASURE DISEASE THAT IMPROVES OUR OWN ABILITY ABILITY TO DO SMARTER MORE EFFICIENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO DEVELOP THE POTENTIAL MEDICINES TO TREAT DISEASE BUT IF WE CAN IMPROVE MEASURES OF DISEASE IN A WAY THAT COULD ALSO BE INTEGRATED INTO CARE. IT HOLDS THE PROMISE OF IMPROVING THOSE. LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. MS OF THE DIFFICULT DISEASE FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL TO BEAR. AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH LEADING HEALTH SYSTEMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE FOR BY THE CIA PM. AS ADVANCED OUR OWN ABILITY TO DO NOW IT PATIENTS NEED NEXT. SO WE CONTINUE TO AND INNOVATE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINES FOR SERIOUS AND LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS. AND ADVANCED TOOL TO UNDERSTAND THESE CONDITIONS. DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS PROMISED TO CHANGE THE WAY HEALTHCARE IS DELIVERED AND OF COURSE ACCESS TO THESE MISSIONS. IT IN AN MORE HANDS THAN EVER BEFORE. HOWEVER ACT THE TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION. ENGAGEMENT FROM THE HEALTH CARE ECOSYSTEM CAN ENSURE THAT A PATIENT IS ENGAGE BUT ALSO THAT THEIR DATA IS VALUED. AND THIS CAN SUPPORT SCALABILITY WHICH ULTIMATELY HOPEFULLY WILL REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH. CHALLENGES WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO RISE AROUND VARYING PRIVACY LAWS VERY ENGAGEMENT FROM PATIENTS PROVIDERS AND PAYERS WE ARE COMMITTED TO THIS PROGRAM. WE'D BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SO THE APP IS THAT THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS OR SENATE. THAT'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL ALTOGETHER HERE WHAT'S THAT. RULE PROCESS YEAH IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION IT'S- TODAY IT'S A RESEARCH TOOL WERE EXPLORING KIND OF WHAT'S THE REGULATORY PATHWAY. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY HAVING SOME FTA REGULATORY. WHEN WE HELPFUL FOR YOU KNOW INDUSTRY IN PURSUING OUR CLINICAL TRIALS PROGRAMS TO WORK KIND OF SKIPPING THAT OUT RIGHT NOW BUT TODAY. IT'S AS A RESEARCH TOOL. IN YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING TODAY ABOUT ACCESS AND- THIS COMMITTEE I THINK AT SOME POINT WE'LL WE'LL DO A US HEARING SPECIFICALLY AROUND. BROADENING ACCESS TO CLINICAL TRIALS. AND DEMOCRATIZING THAT PROCESS SHALL WE SAY SO WE DON'T HAVE A- CLINICAL TRIAL PROCESS FOR THE 1% OR THOSE WHO ARE WIRED IN AND CONNECTED. TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE. TO MAKE A CALL SO TO SPEAK TO GET THEM INTO A CLINICAL TRIAL. SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THIS IS THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS BROADLY ACCESSIBLE BROADLY AVAILABLE WHAT CAN. A COMPANY LIKE GENETIC WITH THE RESOURCES IT HAS. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU ENSURE SOME OF THOSE GOALS ARE MET YEAH I THINK THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IDEA ON ACCESS TO RESEARCH AND CLINICAL TRIALS IS CRITICAL AND I WOULD SAY THAT. YOU KNOW AT GENENTECH FOR WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENSURING DIVERSITY INCLUSION OUR TRIALS AND THAT STARTS WITH NOT ONLY. KIND OF THE INCLUSION EXCLUSION CRATER TRIALS BUT IT STARTS WITH THE ACCESS TO TRIAL CENTERS IT STARTS WITH ACCESS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF PATIENTS TO THE DOCK IS IT'S WITH. MAKING TRIAL REASONABLE FOR PATIENTS TO MANY PEOPLE. CAN'T TAKE TIME OFF WORK CAN'T FIND TELL KAREN CAN'T TRAVEL TO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE WHERE. KEY CLINICAL TRIALS SO HOW CAN WE MAKE THESE TRIALS MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR MORE PEOPLE AND IT'S FOCUSED ON THE INCLUSION EXCLUSION CRITERIA BUT IT'S ALSO FOCUSED ON. YOU KNOW THE SOUP TO NUTS PROCESS OF A CLINICAL TRIAL WHERE THEY SIT WHERE THEY RESIDE IN HOW THY'RE CONDUCTED. YOU KNOW IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL FLOOD LIKE COULD BE A TOOL FOR YOU KNOW SIMILAR TOOLS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VISITS THAT A PATIENT WOULD NEED TO TRAVEL TO A CENTER FOR EXAMPLE. MANY INDIVIDUALS CAN'T PARTICIPATING TRIALS BECAUSE OF THE AND- SO WHILE THEY'RE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR PATIENTS ARE ALSO A BURDEN BECAUSE IT MAY REQUIRE. TRAVEL TO SAN FRANCISCO FINDING COVERAGE FOR THEIR WORK AND SO. WHAT IF WE COULD LEVERAGE THAT KNOWLEDGE. LET TO DETER REMOTELY. WOULD BE VIABLE AND REASONABLE FOR A CLINICAL TRIAL. THAT'S A GREAT AMBITION FOR US AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE POSSIBILITY. THAT MORE PATIENTS COULD BE PART OF THE READ RESEARCH ECOSYSTEM. THANK YOU DOCTOR LARGE AWAY LET'S TURN TO DOCTOR ALLEN ARE TOUGH ASTRAZENECA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT ASTRAZENECA GLOBAL BY PHARMACEUTICALS COMPANY. THAT IS INVOLVED IN THE DISCOVERY THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE DELIVERY OF LIFE CHANGING AND IN MANY CASES LIFESAVING MEDICINES AROUND THE WORLD OF COURSE YOU'LL BE AWARE THAT WE HAVE ON OUR INDIE HUB IN THE BAY AREA SO VERY INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO GO LAST AND RECOGNIZE THAT MY REMARKS ARE ALIGNED WITH EVERYBODY WHO'S GONE BEFORE ME SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING SOME OF THE THEMES THAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIP. IN RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL IN THE PROMISE OF PRECISION MEDICINE. I AM AS THAT MY OPENING SLIDE INDICATES PRECISION MEDICINE PRESSURES ANNIKA IS VERY MUCH IN OUR DNA WE HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF DRIVING PRECISION MEDICINE ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES ANOTHER INDUSTRY AND OTHER FORMS COMPANIES. SINCE THE EARLY. NINETEEN SEVENTIES WITH THE BUILDING OF MARKS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST PRECISION MEDICINES A DRUG THAT IS STILL IN USE TODAY. FOR HORMONE RECEPTOR POSITIVE BREAST CANCER. SINCE THAT TIME. OUR PIPELINE HAS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON PRECISION MEDICINE THERE'S A LOT OF DATA ON THE SLIDE I DON'T REALLY WANT TO FOLLOW THROUGH AND ALL OF THAT BUT I THINK THE NUMBER THAT IS KEY TO LOOK AT HERE IS THE 90% NUMBER CURRENTLY 90% OF THE MOLECULES IN OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE ARE DESIGNED AND BUILT WITH PRECISION MEDICINE IN MIND IT IS THE FUTURE WE ARE ALL MOVING AWAY I THINK FROM A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO MEDICINE. AND IT'S VERY HEARTENING TO HEAR ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES AROUND THE TABLE AND EARLIER TODAY TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT WAYS THE CALIFORNIA IS BEST A GAPING BEYOND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINES THE ABILITY TO BRING PRECISION MEDICINE TO THE FOUR. ASTRAZENECA WE ARE FOCUSED ON THREE MAIN THERAPY AREAS. CARDIOVASCULAR RENAL AND METABOLISM DISEASES. RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND ONCOLOGY AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE REST OF MY- TESTIMONY TODAY I'LL BE FOCUS IN ONCOLOGY. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER NUMBERS ON THE SLIDE ONE ANOTHER NUMBER THAT I THINK IS KEY FOR YOU TO LOOK AT IS THE TWENTY TWO DIAGNOSTIC. TESTS IT'S K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOR&lt;/c&gt;</u> YOU TO UNDERSTAND THIS NUMBER BECAUSE- WE DON'T MAKE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS WE MAKE MEDICINES. ASTRAZENECA ONLY MAKES MEDICINES AND SO TO IN ORDER TO CREATE PRECISION MEDICINES. WE HAVE TO PARTNER WITH OTHER COMPANIES WERE CREATING THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. YOU CAN SEE A NUMBER THERE ARE A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION INVESTED IN DIAGNOSTIC PARTNERSHIPS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. THE PURPOSE OF SHARING THAT NUMBER IS TO CONFIRM REITERATE A LOT OF WHAT'S ALREADY GONE BEFORE US THE PROMISE OF PRECISION MEDICINE. IS BASED ON PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION. THAT IS HOW WE CAN DELIVER WHAT IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX SCIENCE TO THE COMMUNITY WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM OTHERS TALKING ABOUT LEVELING THE LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. AGAIN WE ARE ONE PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND DEVELOPING MEDICINES BUT IN ORDER TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD WE NEED TO CONNECT WITH EVERYBODY. ASTRA'S TO RECOGNIZE SOME TIME AGO THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIPS AND LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. AND SO JUST WITH IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE INITIATED SOME VERY LARGE PARTNERSHIPS WITH ACADEMIC CENTERS WITH CANCER CENTERS AND WITH OTHERS UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T GET INTO THE DETAILS OF WHO THESE ARE THESE PARTNERSHIPS ARE WITH TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE UNDER CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE WE HAVE TO PARTNER WITH OTHERS THAT THESE ARE BIG PROGRAMS THESE ARE VERY SPECIFIC CENTERS HOW CAN WE TAKE THAT IDEA PARTNERSHIP AND BUILD IT EVEN FURTHER. AGAIN I REPRESENT INDUSTRY I REPRESENT ONE COMPANY BUT BEYOND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINES WHICH IS WHAT WE DO. WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A ROLE IN CONVENING THE COMMUNITY. AND SO LAST YEAR ASTRAZENECA U. S. CREATED A PROGRAM CALLED YOUR CANCER. YOUR CANCER PROGRAM IS A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO CONVENE ENGAGE ELEVATE AND CELEBRATE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE MAKING CHANGE OR WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE CHANGE. WITHIN THAT PROGRAM NUMBER OF COMPONENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO REALLY PUSH FORWARD SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT TO SEE BUT I THINK IT'S TELLING THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM WE CHOSE TO FOCUS ON PRECISION MEDICINE. I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY TELLING THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM WE CHOSE TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA I'M PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE GREAT WORK THIS ALREADY HAPPENING IN THE STATE AND BECAUSE OF THE CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE. EARLIER IN THIS YEAR WE CONVENE TWENTY FOUR STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. WHO ARE INVESTED IN THE PRECISION MEDICINE ECOSYSTEM THIS INCLUDED DOCTORS MCCALL AND DOCTORS MUIR. IT INCLUDED PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WE HAD PAYER PRESENT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS ARE ALL INVESTED IN PM ON OUR OLD INTERESTED IN OVERCOMING SOME OF THE BARRIERS AND WE'VE TALKED A LOT AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY FROM PEOPLE TODAY ABOUT THE BARRIERS. TO PRECISION MEDICINE. WE HOSTED A PRECISION MEDICINE ROUNDTABLE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT BARRIERS AND I WON'T GET INTO TOO MANY OF THE DETAILS TODAY BECAUSE IT'S ALL AVAILABLE ONLINE AT YOUR CANCER DOT ORG. BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE I THINK MISTER CHAIR YOU ASKED A QUESTION EARLIER AROUND WHAT SOME OF THE BARRIERS. TO PRECISION MEDICINE MIGHT BE WE TALK SPECIFICALLY AROUND FOUR MAIN AREAS. CLINICAL BARRIERS TO PRECISION MEDICINE. REIMBURSEMENT BARRIERS. TECHNOLOGY BARRIERS AND EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE BUREAUCRACY. WE ARE STILL CONTINUING TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE TWENTY FOUR ATTENDEES FROM THAT SESSION AND THE GREETER AT ECOSYSTEM BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO BRING EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT THIS BUT IS OUR INTENT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT ROOM TABLE IN ORDER TO TRY TO OVERCOME SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS. TO POLICY. IT IS OUR IMPRESSION IT ASKED AND I CAN I THINK IT'S BEEN HERALDED HERE AND REITERATED BY SOME OF THOSE WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME. THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH PRECISION MEDICINE. IS THAT THE SCIENCE IS ADVANCING FAR FASTER. THAN THE RED REGULATION AND LEGISLATION. I'M SO. ANY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO BE PART OF THAT GREATER ECOSYSTEM. TO COME TO YOU TO TALK TO YOU TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND TO HELP EDUCATE EVERYBODY ON WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE. AND SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS TO OVERCOMING THOSECHALLENGES. WOULD BE WELCOME. AND SO IF I CAN CASTRO. YEAH AND I DON'T THE SUFFERS I HAVE INTERRUPTED A PANELIST BUT I I'M JUST. CURIOUS ON THAT. SPECIFICALLY ON THAT POINT ABOUT. GOVERNMENT. MOVING SLOWER THAN THE TECHNOLOGY. IS THAT. THE PERCEPTION OF THE COMPANY THAT THAT'S A LARGELY A FEDERAL PROBLEM FOR MORE OF A STATE BASED PROBLEM OR JUST A MIX OF BOTH. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE ABIZAID. I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE THIS IS NOT A SHOCK. BELIEVE OR NOT BUT A HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THAT. I WOULD SAY IT'S I WOULD SAY IT'S A MIX OF BOTH FEDERAL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL AND I THINK THERE'S REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA. TO REALLY FORGE AHEAD HERE IN TO LEAD FOR THE FEDERAL POLICIES LOCKING BEHIND STILL. AND SO I THINK IT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO TAKE THAT STEP AND WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT WITH SOME STATES AND SOME STATES IMPLEMENTING THEIR OWN LEGISLATION AND OTHER STATES FOLLOWING SUIT BECAUSE THEY SEE THE VALUE. THE CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY POISED BECAUSE OF YOUR INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE BECAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY STARTED TO CONVENE THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS. I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE POINTS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP POSITION WITH PRECISION MEDICINE AND WHAT THE FEDERAL POLICY FOLKS JUST. YET SAYS THOSE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN HIGHLIGHTING TODAY ARE DRAWING INVESTMENT. TO THIS STATE. BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN THIS. OUT INTO THE FUTURE NOW WILL WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHERS YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU. ARE HEARING OTHER STATES LOOK AT DOING TO TRY TO WIN SET OF EYES THIS IS KIND OF ACTIVITY IN THEIR STATE. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I CAN'T SPEAK TOO MANY SPECIFICS FOR STATES SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE POLICY. BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME WORK BEING DONE AROUND VERY SIMPLE THINGS LIKE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. TO SCIENCE OF SIMPLIFY THAT SO THAT AGAIN LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD MAKE IT EASY FOR EVERYBODY TO ACCESS THESE MEDICINES. THERE'S SOME WORK BEING DONE AROUND. SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS WITHIN HOSPITALS WITHIN IN THAT I PATIENT CARE SPACE IN ORDER TO SPEED UP THE ABILITY THAT PATIENTS CAN ACCESS DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE MEDICINES. AND SO ON I'M I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WERE MORE FAMILIAR WITH POLICY IN VARIOUS OTHER STATES WILL NO MORE BUT THERE CERTAINLY. INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH AND BEING APPROVED ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. IT TO TRY AND MAKE COULD DANCE AND MOVE THINGS FORWARD. APPRECIATE THAT. WORK COMPETITIVE STATE SO I WAS LIKE TO. KEEP TABS ON WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING BUT I DIDN'T MEAN THAT TO. DEAD TO DETERMINE YOUR PRESENTATION HERE SO FEEL FREE TO PROCEED. REALLY IF I JUST HAVE TO LEAVE EVERYBODY WITH WITH ONE FINAL REMARK IT IS ASTRAZENECA IS OPINION THAT AS AN INDUSTRY MEMBER AS AN ENTITY THAT CREATES THE MEDICINE WITHIN PRECISION MEDICINE WE HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY BEYOND THAT IN CONVENING AND I'M BEING PART OF THAT GREATER ECOSYSTEM IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT PRECISION MEDICINE. WILL NOT ACHIEVE ITS ENTIRE PROMISE WITH ENGAGED WITHIN THE ECOSYSTEM AND I THINK THAT COMMON HAS BEEN REITERATED BY THOSE WHO'VE TESTIFIED BEFORE ME SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU BOTH VERY VERY MUCH AND WE ARE OVER TIME LIKE I COULD ASK A FEW MORE QUESTIONS BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I THINK WE WILL GO AHEAD AND CONCLUDE BUT THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. FOR THE PRESENTATION WE DO WANT TO MAKE THE OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. AND IF WE DO HAVE ANY TAKERS YES SIR WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD TO THE ACTUALLY. MAKE SURE THAT MY FOLKS ON YEAH. IF YOU JUST COME TO THIS MICROPHONE SIR IT WILL JUST MAKE SURE THAT THAT MICROPHONE IS ON. YES I THINK I THINK RON THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME COME UP TO SPEAK I'M LONNIE BOOKBINDER I'M A CEO OF A BIOTECH COMPANY LOCATED IN DAVIS CALIFORNIA CALLED ARISE PRECISION MEDICINE. THAT TELLS A STORY. ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PREPARE PRODUCTS FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD THEM WHAT WE CAN DO IS A VERY SMALL COMPANY IN A SMALL LABORATORY I'M SMALL BUDGET. AND ONE OF THE THINGS IT IS PART OF THE CI A PM. PROGRAM IS TO. OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRANTS. TO OUR DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. AND I'D I PUT ONE AND JUST LAST YEAR IN A WAS TO DEAL WITH DISPARITY. AND PROSTATE CANCER. THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A- ARE SUSCEPTIBILITY GENE. THAT MAKES AFRICAN AMERICANS AND PERHAPS LATINOS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE SO. IN THE COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT. A REACHING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE START OF A CANCER AND MAY BE OF. BEFORE THE CANCERS EVEN IDENTIFIED YOU HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES AND USE THEM AS BIOMARKERS HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR. THE DIFFICULTY I WANT TO BRING OUT IS AS I LOOKED AT THE PROJECTS FROM THE CIA PM. IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS VERY HEAVILY ACADEMICALLY ORIENTED. AND I DIDN'T SEE MANY PROJECTS THAT REALLY IT COULD BRING A DRUG TO MARKET. MY DEFINITION OF PRECISION MEDICINE IS A LOT MORE NARROW IT'S BRING THE RIGHT DRUG. AT THE RIGHT TIME AT THE RIGHT DOSE. OF TO THE RIGHT LOCATION AND LEAVE NORMAL CELLS ALONE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH OM AND SO WE HAD A PRO A PROJECT THAT WE PUT INTO THE CIA PM WE DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT. AND I WONDER IF THERE IS A WAY TO OVER SEE THE PROGRAM SO THAT SMALL COMPANIES THAT COULD BRING AID. OF A DRUG FOR PROSTATE CANCER DID THAT HAS DISPARITIES THIS FOUNDATION. IF THERE COULD BE EITHER A SEPARATE CATEGORY FOR SMALL COMPANIES AND NOT JUST FOR BIG LARGE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS SO I CHALLENGE THE RAM TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING AND WHETHER OR NOT. IT'S. BEEN FAIR SMALL COMPANY THE BRAND NEW DRIVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE THE COMMENT AND THE RELEVANT FOLKS ARE IN THE ROOM. WHO CAN TAKE THAT COMMENT A HEART WE HAVE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT ONE MORE RESEARCH CHAIRMAN JUST THANK YOU ALL OVER OUR GREAT CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION. ONE RECOGNIZE YOUR EFFORTS IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON BIOTECH FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE AS YOU KNOW IS A TRADE WE HAVE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE WHEN I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. FOR THE INITIATIVE FOR YEARS AGO IN THEIR CONTINUATION IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR ADVANCING PRECISION MEDICINE DID YOUR HEALTH HAVE TREMENDOUS COST BENEFITS THE STATE. AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE ADVOCATED. VOCIFEROUSLY FOR SOME OF THE REGULATORY TWEAKS AND NEEDED TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR SO THANK YOU I THINK YOU POLICY DIRECTOR MISTERS IN CALI. AND EVERYTHING THE COMMITTEE IS NOT. THANKS FOR THE COMMENT. AND WE ARE CAPTURING ALL OF THIS AND I'M SURE THERE WILL BE LEGISLATIVE FOLLOW UP SO I JUST WANNA EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR THOSE OF YOU. WHO TRAVELED A LONG WAY TO BE HERE WITH US TODAY FOR A VERY VALUABLE. A DISCUSSION THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THIS CONCLUDES OUR SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING. AND SAFE TRAVELS
