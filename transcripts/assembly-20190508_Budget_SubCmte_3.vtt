01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:33.542
WHETHER THIS MOVES TO THE POLICY

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:34.143

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:35.711
POSITION.

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:36.512
IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:38.580

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:39.615
INCLUDING STATUTE MEETS THE

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:41.316
GOALS THAT I MISTER LEWIS JUST

YEAH THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:53.562
TODAY IS BECAUSE WHEN WE SAW

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:54.963
THAT WEAKNESS OR THE POTENTIAL

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:56.365
CONFLICT WITH THE HAVING THAT

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:57.900
CONFIDENTIALITY.

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:58.801
STATUTES WE FELT SOONER WAS

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.435
BETTER AND THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:14:00.502 --> 01:14:01.703
CERTAIN WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.306
POLICY PROCESS AND TAKE --

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:06.175
AFFORD THAT ACTION BUT WHAT YOU

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:07.843
WILL BE SEEN AS SOMETHING VERY

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.745
SIMILAR COMING THROUGH THAT

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:13.916
POLICY -- PROCESS.

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:14.550
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.318
CLARIFIED YOUR RESPONSE BUT IT I

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:19.154
KNOW WHEN -- YOU MEAN ORTEGA --

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.489
FOR ME THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAD

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:21.323
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:22.891
GINGER THEY TALKED ABOUT THAT

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.226
WITH THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.227
AND THIS WAS JUST.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:26.628
THE JEWS OPPORTUNITY WE WOULD

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:27.563
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY BRING

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:28.897
SOMETHING BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.265
AND SHARE WITH THEM THE CONCERNS

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.134
WE HAVE ABOUT WHAT LANGUAGE IS

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:33.368
IN THE SB.

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:35.704
ONE SET YOUR NOW AND THEN JUST

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:38.707
TO ADD TO THAT -- WE ARE

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:39.575
CURRENTLY [inaudible]

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.043
EXPERIENCING OPERATIONAL

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:42.978
CHALLENGES IN THIS REGARD --

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:44.012
IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:45.214
SPECULATIVE IN THE FUTURE

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.982
PROBLEM IT IT ACTUALLY EXISTS

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:48.951
NOW AND SO THAT'S WHY WE THOUGHT

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.452
ARENA THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.254
THE APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY TO

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.323
GO DOWN THIS PATH I UNDERSTAND

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:55.757
IT'S NOT REALLY A FISCAL ISSUE.

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:59.027
BUT BY HAVING IT -- BE PART OF A

01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:00.329
TRAILER BILL SUCH AS THIS --

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:01.730
WE'D BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AND

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:04.533
RESOLVE THE INTERNAL CONFLICTS

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.502
THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY.

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.338
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AS

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.272
REYES.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.474
MISTER CHAIR I AGREE WITH THE

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:14.109
COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.310
MY THINK THAT.

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.612
IT DOES APPEAR SOMETHING THAT

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:19.481
WOULD BE -- MORE APPROPRIATE IN

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:21.950
POLICY TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:24.286
TO HAVE FOR THE DISCUSSION ON IT.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.321
OTHER EXAMPLES I KNOW THAT THE

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:29.157
COMMENT WAS THAT IT'S NEEDED NOW.

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:32.661
OTHER EXAMPLES OF WHERE.

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:33.962
THE ABSENCE OF THIS HAS CAUSED

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.797
PROBLEMS.

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.799
SO IN A NORMAL SITUATION YES TO

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:39.268
ANSWER YOUR CANS QUESTION YES I

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:40.502
CAN GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES IN

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:42.137
THE NORMAL SITUATION WHEN THE

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:44.172
STATE AUDITOR'S REACH OUT TO

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:46.241

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:51.313
ABLE TO FREELY.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.382
SHARE THAT WITH THEM -- WITHOUT

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:54.750
WAIVING ANY PRIVILEGES FOR

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:56.051
EXAMPLE I'VE BEEN ASKED IN THE

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:59.488
PAST -- BY THE STATE AUDITOR'S

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:01.089

CLIENT COMMUNICATION PRIVILEGED

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:04.793
AND SO IS VERY HIGHLY

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.194
CONFIDENTIAL BUT I'M ABLE TO

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:07.429
SHARE THAT WITH THE STATE

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:09.798
AUDITOR'S AS PART OF THEIR

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:11.166
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO AN AUDIT.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.701
CURRENTLY WE HAVE SEVERAL

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:14.036
INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON IN THE

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:15.771

BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD WAIVE THE

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:27.015
PRIVILEGE BECAUSE THERE AND IN

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:28.784

THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE HAS

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:36.959
DRAMATICALLY CHANGED UNDER SB.

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:40.329

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:23.899
WE CAN USE AS WE DEVELOP OUR

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:25.133
RISK ASSESSMENT AND THEN.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.301
THERE ARE OTHER PLAN BUT NO

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.469
LONGER DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.404
DID DEPARTMENT I DIRECTOR

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.605
SIGNING OFF ON A LOT OF MY WE

AUTONOMY DID AUDIT WHAT THE BILL

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:43.051
IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THAT

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:44.853
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

IF I COULD ASK DELEO CAN YOU

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:53.228
SHED SOME LIGHT IN TERMS OF THE

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:55.197
BEST PRACTICES OF OF WHETHER AN

EXTERNAL AN INSPECTOR GENERAL IS

01:18:57.432 --> 01:18:59.601
PREFERENTIAL TO ONE AS WITHIN AN

AND IN ORDER FOR THAT IT'S AN

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:12.314
INSPECTOR GENERAL OR REALLY ANY

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.616
SORT OF OVERSIGHT AND TWO T. --

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:15.951
AS I THINK AS LONG AS IT'S

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:18.353
STRUCTURED IN A WAY WHERE YOU

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.188

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.057
INFORMATION THAT IS COMING OUT

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:23.358
IS.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:25.393
AND YOU KNOW HELPING TO IDENTIFY

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.496
ISSUES AND AND GIVING THAT SORT

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:28.930
OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:30.098
THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS THAT IT

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:32.200
CAN BE STRUCTURED -- WENT WHEN

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:33.869
AN ENITY IS COMPLETELY OUTSIDE

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:35.837
OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT AND YOU

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.239
CAN CERTAINLY MAKE IT CLEANER

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.674
MAY BE EASIER TO SEE AND LINES

01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:41.343
OF OF ON INDEPENDENCE.

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:43.044
BUT AS LONG AS IT'S STRUCTURED

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.980
IN SUCH A WAY WHERE YOU HAVE --

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:46.748
CHECKS AND BALANCES AND ITS

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:49.184
FUNCTIONING AND THE OVERSIGHT

01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:50.619
ENTITY IS ABLE TO REPORT TO THE

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:53.989

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:55.190
ON WHAT ITS FINDINGS ARE THERE

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:56.458
THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:57.359
CAN STRUCTURE IT.

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:59.194
LOOKING AT OTHER INSPECTOR

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:03.331

ONES ARE EXTERNAL AND WHICH ONES.

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.878
IT IS OUR HOUSE WITHIN THE

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.180
AGENCY I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:19.981
HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US TO SEE

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:21.983

ARE AND AND TO I COULD SEE I

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:09.965

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:11.266
GIVING A LITTLE BIT.

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:02.864
A TRAIN OPERATOR REVIEWED THE

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.432
CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES AND

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:05.533
PERFORMED A BENCHMARKING

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.369
EXERCISE FOCUSED ON CAST COST

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.672
CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT LOCATION

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:12.674

VIADUCTS AND BRIDGES.

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.144
AND COMPARED THAT TO COST

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:18.112
EXPERIENCE IN GERMANY WHICH IS

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:19.681
WHERE THEY DETAILS FROM.

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:21.182
AT THAT ANALYSIS SUGGESTED SOME

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:23.184
OPPORTUNITIES FOR COST SAVINGS

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:24.486
WHICH WILL BE FURTHER EXPLORED

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:26.521
DURING PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:27.856
AND FINAL DESIGN PHASES.

01:25:27.922 --> 01:25:29.624
LASTLY THE AUTHORITY COMPLETED A

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:31.993
MORE RIGOROUS RISK EVALUATION

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.828
AND MADE UPDATES TO CENTRAL

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:35.063
VALLEY COST ESTIMATES.

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:36.564
THESE ESTIMATES INCREASE THE

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:38.399
CONTINGENCY FROM ABOUT FIVE

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:39.334
HUNDRED MILLION TO ABOUT ONE

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.568
POINT FIVE BILLION.

ADDITIONALLY THIS PROJECT UPDATE

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:05.713
REPORT INCLUDES THIS THOROUGH

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:07.448
DISCUSSION OF RISK INCLUDING

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:08.916
RISK RELATED TO THE FEDERAL

THANK YOU.

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:15.690
CAN YOU GO INTO A LITTLE BIT

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:17.025
MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW.

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:19.961
YOU -- WHAT WHAT THE PARAMETERS

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:22.397
WERE THAT WERE USED -- AFTER THE

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:26.501
EARLY OPERATOR -- OPTIONS SURE.

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.169
WELL THIS WAS BASED OFF THE THE

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:29.270
CALL IN THE TWENTY EIGHT

01:28:29.337 --> 01:28:30.672
BUSINESS PLAN TO LOOK AT THE

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:31.939
VALLEY TO VALLEY SEGMENT

01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:33.641
REALIZING THE CURRENT FUNDING

01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:35.343
WASN'T SUFFICIENT TO FULLY BUILT

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:36.344
VALLEY TO VALLEY.

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:38.312
WITH THAT GAP IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.148
THAT THE TUNNEL SUPER JACO SO

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:42.216
THE ET -- FOCUSED BOTH ON THE

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:44.452
SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY SEGMENT.

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:47.321
AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT.

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.057
AND LOOKED AT WHAT THE BENEFITS

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:51.059
WOULD BE OF HAVING A HIGH SPEED

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:53.561
OPERATION ON THOSE SEGMENTS AND

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.229
OF COURSE IN THE BAY AREA -- YOU

01:28:55.296 --> 01:28:57.298
HAVE THE CALTRAIN SERVICE THAT

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:59.167
WOULD BE RUNNING -- ON THOSE

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:01.335
SAME -- ALIGNMENTS IN IN THE

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.204
CENTRAL VALLEYRECOGNIZING THE

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:09.644
ACE AND THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE --

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:10.278
LA -- DID YOU WANNA MAKE SOME

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:11.746
COMMENTS LATER HAILING CHRISTY

01:29:11.813 --> 01:29:12.814
WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.049
OFFICE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SIX

01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:16.150
MAJOR ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:18.352
CONSIDERATION -- PRELIMINARILY

01:29:18.419 --> 01:29:20.021
I'M SO BROUGH BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:21.789
THOSE FOR YOU THAT'S ACCESSIBLE

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.958
YES -- SO AS WAS INDICATED BY

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.359
THE AUTHORITY.

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:26.627
THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.196
REFOCUSES THE PROJECT IT

01:29:28.262 --> 01:29:29.764
REFOCUSES IT ON A SEGMENT

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.733
BETWEEN MERCED IN BAKERSFIELD.

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:33.034
THIS IS BASED IN PART BY THIS

01:29:33.101 --> 01:29:34.635
ANALYSIS THAT THAT WAS CONDUCTED

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.904
BY THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR --

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:38.606
WE WOULD KNOW HOWEVER THAT THE

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:39.674
THAT ANALYSIS IS HIGHLY

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:40.408
DEPENDENT ON SOME THE

01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:42.143
ASSUMPTIONS THAT THAT REALLY

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.644
TRAIN OPERATOR MADE IN TERMS OF

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:44.512
HOW THIS.

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:46.114
US SERVICE WOULD INTEGRATE WITH

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.615
EXISTING OTHER SERVICES

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.917
INCLUDING A SEND AN AMTRAK AS

01:29:49.984 --> 01:29:51.219
WELL AS THE CUSTOM CAPITAL

01:29:51.285 --> 01:29:52.887
PROJECT THAT WE NEED TO OCCUR I

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:53.955
FOR EXAMPLE HAVING SHARED

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:56.090
STATION AT MERCED WHICH IS NOT I

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:59.927
AM CURRENTLY -- I SO CERTAINLY --

01:29:59.994 --> 01:30:01.596
SHOULD THESE ASSUMPTIONS NOT

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:03.397
MATERIALIZE THAT COULD AFFECT

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:07.802
BOTH THE RIDERSHP AND REVENUE

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:09.036
PROJECTIONS THAT ARE ASSUME.

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:09.670
THE SECOND ISSUE WANTED TO FLAG

01:30:09.737 --> 01:30:10.304
IS THAT WE BELIEVE THE ACTUAL

01:30:10.371 --> 01:30:11.105
COST OF THE PROJECT COULD

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.640
POTENTIALLY BE HIGHER THAN ARE

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:13.574
ESTIMATED.

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:14.642
I'M PART OF THIS IS JUST

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.277
INTRINSIC TO ANY LARGE MAKE UP

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:18.146
PROJECT WHICH IS OF COURSE --

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:19.213
SUBJECT IS SUBSTANTIAL

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.282
UNCERTAINTY I THIS PROJECT ALSO

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:23.050
HAS SOME UNIQUE RISKS INCLUDING

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:25.153
REGARDING SCHEDULING -- WHICH

01:30:25.219 --> 01:30:27.255
COULD INCREASE COSTS -- FOR THE

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:28.256
MORE WE JUST WANTED TO ALSO HIGH

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:31.993
LATE -- AN ASPECT OF THE FORTIES

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:34.295
ASSUMPTIONS FOR HOW IT HAS COME

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:35.963
TO ITS ITS ESTIMATE SO IT'S

01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:38.866
INDICATED THAT -- IN THE TWO

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:39.500
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PLAN IT'S AT

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:41.335
THE BASELINE BUDGET SUCH THAT

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:43.471
THERE'S A 10% CHANCE THAT --

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:45.139
THAT BASICALLY THE THE PROJECT

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:46.641
WILL COME IN AT OR BELOW THAT

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.509
BASELINE BUDGET -- IT'S NOT

01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:50.011
REVISED THAT APPROACH TO TO

01:30:50.077 --> 01:30:52.680
BASICALLY ASSUME A 70% CHANCE

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:53.781
THAT THE PROJECT WILL COME IN AT

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:56.117
OR BELOW THAT COST ESTIMATE BUT

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:57.552
ONLY FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD.

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:58.886
WE HAVEN'T RE LOOKED AT THE

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:00.688
ENTIRE PROJECT COST AND WE

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:01.823
BELIEVE THAT IF YOU DID THAT FOR

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:03.057
THE ENTIRE PROJECT YOU PROBABLY

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:04.692
END UP WITH THAT A HIGHER COST

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:06.894
ESTIMATE AND THAT IS REFLECTED

01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:07.261
FOR THE ENTIRE.

01:31:07.328 --> 01:31:08.696
WHO HELPED HOW COULD YOU DO THAT

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:10.364
IF YOU DON'T KNOW -- AT THIS

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:15.102
POINT THE THE ROCK HASN'T BEEN

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:17.305
DETERMINED SO.

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:18.339
SO THEY DO HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:18.940
YEAH THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:19.841
QUESTION THEY THEY HAVE SOME --

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:20.608
COST ESTIMATES THAT THEY PUT

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:22.043
TOGETHER FOR PHASE ONE IN

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:23.644
PREVIOUS BUSINESS PLANS OF FOR

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:25.746
EXAMPLE -- THAT TWO THOUSAND

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:26.781
EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN.

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:28.449
IDENTIFIED ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:29.650
BILLION DOLLARS OF A TOTAL COSTS

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:32.186
THAT WAS ASSUMING A ROUTE --

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:33.754
THAT WOULD YOU THE ROUTE THAT

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:35.690
SORT OF BEEN DISCUSSED I

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:37.158
CERTAINLY THEIR REFINING THAT

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:38.960
THE SPECIFICS OF IT BUT I THINK

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:41.295
THE GENERAL ROUTE HAS BEEN --

01:31:41.362 --> 01:31:43.297
YOU KNOW HAS BEEN -- LAID OUT

01:31:43.364 --> 01:31:44.599
SUCH THAT THEY FELT COMFORTABLE

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:45.733
THAT THEY COULD IDENTIFY THAT

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.736
PROJECT COST -- CERTAINLY

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:50.137
THERE'S MORE -- THERE'S A

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:53.107
GREATER RANGE OF POTENTIAL COSTS --

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:53.741
FOR THOSE ASPECT THAT HAVEN'T

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:56.844
BEEN BEEN PRECISELY NAIL DOWN TO

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:57.712
THOSE SEGMENTS THAT -- THEY

01:31:57.778 --> 01:31:59.413
HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT EXACTLY THAT

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.115
PICKED THE CORRIDOR ARE SUBJECT

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.149
MORE UNCERTAINTY BUT THEY WERE

01:32:02.216 --> 01:32:03.985
STILL ABLE TO PROVIDE A RANGE

01:32:04.051 --> 01:32:05.820
AND AT A POINT ESTIMATE.

01:32:05.887 --> 01:32:07.188
BUT THE POINT ESTIMATE I THINK

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:08.322
OUR OUR POINT IS THE POINT

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:10.591
ESTIMATE WAS SAT ON IT.

01:32:10.658 --> 01:32:11.692
USING A LESS CONSERVATIVE

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:13.494
METHODOLOGY THAN THEY'RE USING

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:15.062
NOW FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:15.997
AND IF THEY APPLIED THAT MORE

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:17.531
CONSERVATIVE METHODOLOGY TO THE

01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:19.667
ENTIRE COST ESTIMATE.

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.602
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST AS

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.104
IT WOULD BE HIGHER THAN THAN NOW

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:25.673
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS AT

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:26.240
SEVENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:27.942
BECAUSE THERE'S AT A ROUGHLY TWO

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:29.143
BILLION DOLLAR COST.

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:33.447
THAT THAT THE US 70% -- ESTIMATE

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:34.916
ABOVE OR BELOW IS.

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:36.350
KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:43.958
SUCH A OF A LARGE NUMBER -- IT.

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:45.593
IT IT'S A IT'S IT COULD BE 70%

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.629
HIGHER 70% LOWER OR IS A 70%

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:50.264
CHANCE THAT IT COULD BE HIGHER.

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:53.501
OR LOWER OR IS THAT SKEWED TO IN

01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:54.936
ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER IT

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:56.137
SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE.

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:58.306
YES TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:32:58.372 --> 01:32:59.774
THE WAY THEY DID IT BEFORE THEY

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.276
BASICALLY -- DID A SIMULATION A

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:04.946
MODELING EXERCISE TO LOOK AT

01:33:05.012 --> 01:33:06.580
SORT OF WHAT ARE THE CHANCES

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:08.049
THAT THE COST ESTIMATES WOULD

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:08.950
WOULD.

01:33:09.016 --> 01:33:10.985
BE IT WOULD FALLING DIFFERENT AT

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:12.987
DIFFERENT LEVELS BASICALLY AND

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:13.788
PREVIOUSLY THEY TOOK THAT SORT

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:15.856
OF I'M GONNA DISTRIBUTION AT

01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:16.791
THAT LEVEL OF LITTLE BIT OF

01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:17.925
TECHNICAL.

01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:19.527
KIND OF EXERCISE BUT AND THEY

01:33:19.593 --> 01:33:22.296
BASICALLY SET THE POINT ESTIMATE --

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:24.699
ASSUMING THAT ESSENTIALLY --

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:26.167
THERE'S ONLY A 10% CHANCE THEY

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:27.635
WOULD STAY WITHIN THAT THAT

01:33:27.702 --> 01:33:29.337
BUDGET THAT'S PRETTY LOW I MEAN

01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:30.838
WHEN THERE'S A 90% CHANCE ARE

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:32.073
GONNA GO OVER BUDGET RIGHT.

01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:33.174
AND THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.342
PRETTY THAT'S NOT A VERY

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.277
CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE SO THEY'VE

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:38.312
INDICATED THAT NOW BASED ON BEST

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:39.847
PRACTICES THE REVISING THAT

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:41.148
ASSUMPTION AND NOW THEY'RE

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:42.650
TAKING A MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:45.119
APPROACH -- AND TAKING A 70% SO

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:47.388
NOW THEY'RE ASSUMING -- A

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:49.357
CONTINGENCY SUCH THAT THERE'S A

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:50.925
70% CHANCE THEY'LL STAY AT OR

01:33:50.992 --> 01:33:58.165
BELOW THAT COST ESTIMATE.

01:33:58.232 --> 01:33:59.867
THAT SEEMS VERY REASONABLE TO US.

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:00.868
MISS HURT YEAH I KNOW IT'S AT OR%

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:01.469
BACK OR BELOW SO NOW THEY'RE

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:03.471
DOING 70% AT OR BELOW THAT COST

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.039
AFTER I I NEED MAY HAVE NOT MADE

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:06.240
THAT CLEAR I APOLOGIZE BUT

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:06.607
THAT'S A MUCH.

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:07.174
THAT DOES SEEM LIKE A MUCH

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:08.476
PREFERABLE KIND OF ASSUMPTION

01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:09.310
IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY MORE

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:11.412
CONSERVATIVE THAN THAN THE 10%

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:13.180
APPROACH -- BUT WE WOULD AND WE

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:14.548
WOULD KNOW THAT THEY ONLY APPLY

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:16.717
THAT METHODOLOGY. TO MERCED TO

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:19.387
BAKERSFIELD NOT TO THE ENTIRE

01:34:19.453 --> 01:34:21.222
PROJECT SO IF YOU DIDN'T IF YOU

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.090
HAD APPLIED THAT METHODOLOGY TO

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:24.458
THE ENTIRE PROJECT.

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:25.326
I YOU WOULD LIKE WE HAVE A

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:26.961
HIGHER COST ESTIMATES WOULD I BE

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:28.229
CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT'S

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:31.098
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT -- AS AS

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:33.234
WE SIT HERE NOW WE'RE TALKING

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.903
ABOUT A PROJECT THAT -- TO AS IT

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:37.071
MOVES FORWARD INTO THOSE OTHER

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:40.174
AREAS IS FAR LESS PREDICTABLE --

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:42.309
FORCE AS HERS SITTING HERE NOW

01:34:42.376 --> 01:34:44.045
SO YEAH I AND I BILL EIGHTY TO

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:45.479
KIND OF USE THAT THAT MORE

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:47.314
CONSERVATIVE NUMBER.

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:48.849
OF APPLIES HERE BUT IT.

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:53.954
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO APPLY TO

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.489
THE LONGER TERM -- YET THEY DO

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:56.424
HAVE THEY DO HAVE A RATIONAL

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:57.425
WITHIN THE BUSINESS AND I THINK

01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:58.192
IT'S SOME ALONG THOSE LINES AND

01:34:58.259 --> 01:34:58.826
THEY CAN PROBABLY SPEAK TO THAT

01:34:58.893 --> 01:34:59.193
IN MORE DETAIL.

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.227
HOWEVER I THINK WE WOULD WE

01:35:00.294 --> 01:35:00.828
WOULD ARGUE THAT ACTUALLY YOU

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:02.363
MIGHT WANT TO I THINK HOW THAT

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:03.831
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH FOR THOSE

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:06.100
VERY AND CERTAIN AREAS AS WELL --

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:08.169
BECAUSE THERE'S I MEAN YES YOU

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:09.770
CAN HAVE A LARGER RANGE IN TERMS

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:12.339
OF YOUR YOUR POSSIBLE COST BUT

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:14.341
IN TERMS OF SETTING YOUR POINT

01:35:14.408 --> 01:35:15.743
ESTIMATE FOR BUDGETING PURPOSES.

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:16.844
WE STILL BELIEVE THAT IT MAKES

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:18.412
SENSE TO SET THAT SUCH THAT

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:20.448
THERE'S A RELATIVELY SMALL

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:21.749
CHANCE TO GO OVER THAT BUDGET

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:22.616
BECAUSE WHEN YOU KNOW WE DON'T

01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:24.685
WANNA -- WE WANNA MAKE SURE

01:35:24.752 --> 01:35:25.553
WE'RE REALISTIC IN SETTING THAT

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:26.987
BUDGET A SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.656
REALLY HAS A SENSE OF WHAT IS

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:29.323
COMMITTING.

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:33.761
TO SO I I THINK I INTERRUPTED

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:35.229
TELL YEAH.

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:36.430
AS FOR THAT BUT BEFORE YOU MOVE

01:35:36.497 --> 01:35:39.233
ON WHEN -- LA WAS COMPLETED --

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:39.967
HER REMARKS MR ANAS MAYBE YOU

01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:41.535
CAN RESPOND TO THAT PARTICULAR

01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:43.537
ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.873
APPLY A MORE CONSERVATIVE --

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.609
APPROACH TO COST -- AT ESTIMATES

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:51.479
FOR THE FUTURE SEGMENTS.

01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:53.247
SO AT THE I APOLOGIZE -- IT SO

01:35:53.314 --> 01:35:54.548
THE THIRD MAJOR ISSUE THAT WE

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.517
WANTED TO FLAG FOR FOLKS IS THAT

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:57.518
WE BELIEVE IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:59.120
THEY'LL BE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:00.121
COMPLETE THE MERCED TO

01:36:00.187 --> 01:36:02.123
BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT -- AND

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:03.624
PARTLY THAT'S BECAUSE OF THIS

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:05.025
COST UNCERTAINTY CERTAINLY COSTS

01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:06.560
COULD BE HIGHER IT'S ALSO

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:07.761
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY

01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:09.930
ON THE REVENUE SIDE AS WELL --

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:11.765
AS WAS MENTIONED -- THERE'S A

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:13.033
THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.568
IN FEDERAL FUNDING I BELIEVE THE

01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:15.970
COMMITTEE IS AWARE OF THIS THAT --

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:17.771
THAT THE PROJECT HAS RECEIVED

01:36:17.838 --> 01:36:19.473
HOWEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.775
HAS THREATENS TO RESCIND THESE

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:24.311
DOLLARS AND SHOULD THAT OCCUR --

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:25.212
THAT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH MORE

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:27.148
DIFFICULT FOR THE PROJECT TO BE

01:36:27.214 --> 01:36:29.383
FULLY FUNDED -- ADDITIONALLY

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.618
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME UNCERTAINTY

01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:31.619
WITH CAP AND TRADE REVENUES AS

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:33.287
THE AS THE COMMITTEE IS IS AWARE

01:36:33.354 --> 01:36:34.588
AND I'M SO WE THINK THAT THE

01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:35.856
ASSUMPTIONS ON THE CABIN TRADE

01:36:35.923 --> 01:36:38.025
REVENUES ARE REASONABLE BUT BUT

01:36:38.092 --> 01:36:38.993
SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTIES WE

01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:42.730
WANTED TO FLAG THAT FOR FOLKS AS

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.131
WELL -- CERTAINLY TO THE EXTENT

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:44.832
THAT THOSE FUNDS DON'T

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:45.766
MATERIALIZE OUR COSTS ARE HIGHER

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:46.867
THE GENERAL FUND -- OTHER

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:48.235
FUNDING SOURCES COULD BE

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:50.671
REQUIRED -- FOURTH WE WANTED TO

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:51.972
FIGHT THAT THERE'S NO FUNDING

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.774
PLAN BEYOND MERCED TO

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:55.609
BAKERSFIELD AT THIS POINT SO ON

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:56.110
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:57.878
LEGISLATURE WANTED TO GO BEYOND

01:36:57.945 --> 01:36:59.980
THAT SEGMENT AND WANTED TO

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:01.182
EXTEND AND YOU ALL ABOUT IT

01:37:01.248 --> 01:37:02.349
VALLEY OR DO ALL OF PHASE ONE

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:03.417
ADDITIONAL FUNDS WOULD BE.

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:05.486
REQUIRED -- LIKELY FROM THE

01:37:05.553 --> 01:37:08.923
GENERAL FUND -- AT LEAST AND IN

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:11.492
WHOLE OR IN PART -- FIFTH -- WE

01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:12.793
DID WANT TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:14.795
THE LEGISLATURE HAS VARIOUS

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:16.597
OPTIONS FOR MOVING FORWARD SO WE

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:17.798
CONTINUE TO THINK THIS IS A GOOD

01:37:17.865 --> 01:37:19.633
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.202
TO ASSESS WHAT IT'S PRIORITIES

01:37:21.268 --> 01:37:22.770
ARE AND HOW IT WANTS TO APPROACH

01:37:22.836 --> 01:37:23.904
THE PROJECT.

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:25.072
ON THIS IS THAT A LITTLE BIT OF

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:26.740
A SHIFT IN APPROACH FOR THE

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:29.109
AUTHORITY AND ALSO JUST GIVEN

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:30.678
GIVEN THIS FUNDING GAP AND GIVEN.

01:37:30.744 --> 01:37:31.478
SORT OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT

01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:32.513
CONSIDERATIONS FACING THE

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.148
LEGISLATURE WE THINK THIS IS A

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:36.350
GOOD CHANCE TO SERVE STEP BACK

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:38.118
AND THINK ABOUT -- WHAT AT THE

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:39.520
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO DO IN TERMS

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:41.422
OF ITS -- IT'S PRIORITIES FOR

01:37:41.488 --> 01:37:43.390
THIS PROJECT I THEY SAID THERE

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:45.392
ARE THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE OPTION

01:37:45.459 --> 01:37:46.594
BUT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.362
AVAILABLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:37:48.429 --> 01:37:49.930
COMMIT FOR EXAMPLE TO A SHORTER

01:37:49.997 --> 01:37:51.699
SEGMENT JUST DOING FOR EXAMPLE

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.067
THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT.

01:37:53.133 --> 01:37:54.668
COULD DO A LONGER SEGMENT -- IT

01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:56.737
COULD IT COULD FOCUS ON HIGH

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.973
SPEED SERVICE AS IS PROPOSED IN

01:37:59.039 --> 01:38:01.642
THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT OR IT

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:03.510
COULD -- HAVE SOME KIND OF

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:05.179
EITHER IN AROUND OUR LONGER TERM

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:06.780
SERVICE THAT WOULD BE.

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:08.282
LESS HIGH SPEED IT UP

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:09.783
POTENTIALLY OR COULD EVEN USE

01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:12.019
CONVENTIONAL DIESEL A SERVICE

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:13.621
THERE VARIETY OF OPTIONS THAT

01:38:13.687 --> 01:38:15.322
ARE AVAILABLE TO LEGISLATURE --

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:16.757
WE THINK THAT THEY SHOULD ALL BE

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:18.559
CONSIDERED AND CERTAINLY THE

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:20.227
LEGISLATURE SHOULD EVALUATE THEM --

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:22.496
AND THEN FINALLY WE DO LAY OUT

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:24.565
SOME POTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS AS

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:26.567
AS LEGISLATURE EVALUATE THOSE

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:27.935
OPTIONS ALL JUST VERY QUICKLY.

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:29.870
BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THEM ONE IS

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:31.772
COST -- TO THE INITIAL

01:38:31.839 --> 01:38:32.506
CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT IS NOW

01:38:32.573 --> 01:38:34.041
ESTIMATED TO COST TWELVE POINT

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:35.643
FOUR BILLION THAT'S UP BY ONE

01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:36.744
POINT EIGHT BILLION FROM

01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:37.911
PREVIOUS ESTIMATES.

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:39.179
ON THE EXTENSIONS TO MERCED AND

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:41.215
BAKERSFIELD IN TOTAL ARE

01:38:41.282 --> 01:38:45.119
ESTIMATED TO COST ABOUT FOUR

01:38:45.185 --> 01:38:46.487
BILLION MORE.

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:47.488
THE SECOND CONSIDERATION IS

01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:48.956
TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS SO WE

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:49.623
BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:51.725
WANT TO WEIGH THE TRANSPORTATION

01:38:51.792 --> 01:38:53.160
BENEFITS THEM ACCESSIBILITY

01:38:53.227 --> 01:38:55.095
MOBILITY BENEFITS ASSOCIATED

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:55.729
WITH A DIFFERENT OPTIONS AGAINST

01:38:55.796 --> 01:38:57.097
THEIR COSTS.

01:38:57.164 --> 01:38:58.432
SO FOR EXAMPLE THOSE EXTENSIONS

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:00.567
YOU DO THOSE PROVIDE FOR BILLION

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:02.136
DOLLARS WORTH OF BENEFITS -- AND

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:04.238
THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT THE

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:05.172
CHOICE FACING THE LEGISLATURE.

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:07.875
I'M ALSO WE WE RECOMMEND

01:39:07.941 --> 01:39:09.009
CONSIDERING EFFECTS ON LOCAL

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:10.544
COMMUNITIES BUT IN TERMS OF

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:12.413
CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS -- AND AND

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:14.348
DISRUPTIONS AS WELL AS ECONOMIC

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:16.250
BENEFITS THAT CAN BE PROVIDED --

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:17.751
AND THEN ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:39:17.818 --> 01:39:19.453
THERE ARE -- THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.854
GONNA WANNA CONSIDERED ANY RISKS

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.122
AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED

01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:23.824
WITH THE OPTIONS THAT AGENDA

01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:25.025
DOES A REALLY NICE JOB OF

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:27.695
OUTLINING A NUMBER OF THOSE --

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:28.796
YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE INVOLVED

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:30.731
COST INCREASES COORDINATION WITH

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.333
OTHER ENTITIES WE BRIEFLY

01:39:32.399 --> 01:39:33.901
TOUCHED ON THOSE AS WELL AS A

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:35.002
POTENTIAL ISSUES RELATED TO

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:36.337
COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION ONE

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:38.405
A REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:45.379
AT ANSWERING THAT EARLIER

01:39:45.446 --> 01:39:46.747
QUESTION SURE SURE.

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:48.182
AND THE ISLAND IT UP TO

01:39:48.248 --> 01:39:49.350
QUESTIONS FROM FROM THEM THAT

01:39:49.416 --> 01:39:51.051
WAS A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THAT

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:52.319
THE CHANGE IN THAT AND

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:54.188
PROBABILITIES AND RISK AND SO

01:39:54.254 --> 01:39:55.356
FORTH AND THAT.

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:57.791
GENERALLY THE PROJECT UPDATE

01:39:57.858 --> 01:39:59.526
REPORT DOES NOT INCLUDE AT

01:39:59.593 --> 01:40:01.795
REEVALUATION OF ALL PROJECT CASA

TYPICALLY IS THAT BUSINESS PLANS

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:05.299
THAT ARE DONE IN THE EVEN

NUMBERED YEARS.

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:07.735
SO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY

01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:10.137
BE WORKING ON UPDATED ESTIMATES

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:12.673

WILL REQUIRE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:40:49.276 --> 01:40:51.111
OF SUBSIDY.

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:54.014

AROUND THAT IN IN THE CENTRAL

01:42:01.815 --> 01:42:03.550
VALLEY -- WHEN WE'VE BEEN

01:42:03.617 --> 01:42:06.019
WORKING ON THE HUNDRED NINETEEN

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:10.190
MILE SEGMENT -- SINCE. TWO

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:12.092
THOUSAND TWELVE THAT AS WITH THE

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.061
FEDERAL GRANT ALWAYS ENVISIONED

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:16.763
THIS IDEA OF INTERIM SERVICER

01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:18.665
INTERIM USE OF THAT FACILITY.

01:42:18.732 --> 01:42:20.167
AS AS BEEN PLANS WITH THE

OUT.

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:33.146
AND AND ADD LONGER HAVE HIGH

SPEED RAIL SERVICE SO -- WITH

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:37.351
LOOKED AT THAT SERVICE WITH THE

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:40.153
IDEA THAT OTHER OPERATORS --

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.256
WOULD BE USING THE FACILITY IN

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:44.324
THE INTERIM BEFORE YOU HAVE THAT

01:42:44.391 --> 01:42:46.693
LONGER HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.695
THAT WOULD BE OPERATED.

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:51.064
DIRECTLY BY HIGH SPEED RAIL --

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:53.166
CONSISTENT WITH THAT REQUIREMENT --

01:42:53.233 --> 01:42:55.569
LEGALLY -- IT'S SIMILAR TO THE

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:58.539
CALTRAIN EXAMPLE IN THE BAY AREA --

01:42:58.605 --> 01:43:00.274
THERE WITH THE BOOK AND FINDS

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.409
ABOUT SAYS SIX HUNDRED MILLION A

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:05.212
PROP ONE A FUNDS -- HAVE GONE OR

01:43:05.279 --> 01:43:08.215
ARE GOING TO THAT -- SEGMENT OF

01:43:08.282 --> 01:43:12.119
CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION THAT

01:43:12.185 --> 01:43:15.522
WOULD BE -- USED INITIALLY BY

01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:18.325
CALTRAIN -- CALTRAIN RECEIVES

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:19.760
OPERATING SUBSIDIES TO RUN THAT

01:43:19.826 --> 01:43:22.229
SERVICE -- LATER ON HIGH SPEED

01:43:22.296 --> 01:43:23.497
RAIL WILL WILL BE ON THAT

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:24.898
SEGMENT AS WELL AS A SHARED

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:27.868
SEGMENT -- THERE WAS MENTION

01:43:27.935 --> 01:43:29.236
ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS A A BILL

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:34.107
BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MALL AND AB --

01:43:34.174 --> 01:43:34.708
EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE THAT --

01:43:34.775 --> 01:43:36.310
CLARIFIED AS SOME OF THOSE

01:43:36.376 --> 01:43:38.579
PROVISIONS AROUND INVESTMENT OF

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:41.348
HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDS THAT SERVE --

01:43:41.415 --> 01:43:43.350
OTHER PASSENGER RAIL OPERATORS

01:43:43.417 --> 01:43:45.485
AND THEIR INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

01:43:45.552 --> 01:43:46.987
USEFUL FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL --

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:48.855
WHEN HIGH SPEED RAIL EVENTUALLY

01:43:48.922 --> 01:43:50.991
GETS TO THOSE SEGMENTS -- BUT IN

01:43:51.058 --> 01:43:52.826
THE INTERIM IT'S APPROPRIATE

01:43:52.893 --> 01:43:54.995
WITH BOND PROCEEDS TO HAVE THOSE

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:57.464
EARLY INVESTMENTS IN THE

01:43:57.531 --> 01:43:58.098
CORRIDOR.

01:43:58.165 --> 01:43:59.566
AGAIN I'M I'M SPECIFICALLY

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:03.136
REFERRING TO OPERATIONAL SUBSIDY.

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:05.238
AND THE EXPRESS LANGUAGE IN THE

01:44:05.305 --> 01:44:06.907
BOND.

01:44:06.974 --> 01:44:08.842
WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS THAT

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:12.679
YOU WILL ESSENTIALLY OFF LOAD TO

01:44:12.746 --> 01:44:14.715
AMTRAK FOR EXAMPLE IN CENTRAL

01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:16.149
CALIFORNIA?

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:18.752
AND THEREFORE AMTRAK WILL HAVE

01:44:18.819 --> 01:44:22.489
TO ABSORB -- THE THE SUBSIDY.

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:24.191
BUT THE LANGUAGE IS IS VERY

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:26.693
CLEAR THAT THE SERVICE.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.362
PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITY OR

01:44:28.428 --> 01:44:30.764
PURSUANT TO YOUR AUTHORITY.

I THINK PUTS AT RISK.

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:57.290
AND I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY.

01:44:57.357 --> 01:45:00.460
DISCOVERED THAT -- THERE IS

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:01.495

WAS MISINTERPRETED SO.

01:47:13.393 --> 01:47:15.629
WHAT SAID WHAT IS REQUIRED BY

01:47:15.695 --> 01:47:17.664
THE FEDERAL GRANT IS TO LAY DOWN

01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:19.599
THE TRACK WORK AND THAT WAS WHAT

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:22.269
IS BEING REFERRED TO SO BY

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:23.703
TWENTY TWENTY TWO END OF?

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.172
TWENTY TWENTY TWO REQUIREMENT.

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:27.707
TO LAY DOWN THE TRACK LATER THE

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:29.609
PROJECT WAS EXPANDED WHEN WE DID

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:31.945
THE FUNDING PLAN AND AT LAKE

01:47:32.012 --> 01:47:33.847
TWENTY SIXTEEN EARLY TWENTY

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:36.016
SEVENTEEN FOR THAT ONE A BONDS

01:47:36.082 --> 01:47:37.017
TO INCLUDE ELECTRIFICATION.

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:39.886
OF THAT -- HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:41.555
SEGMENT SO IT THAT'S THE

01:47:41.621 --> 01:47:43.690
DISTINCTION I BELIEVE THAT WAS

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:44.491
BEING REFERRED TO YOU HAVE.

01:47:44.558 --> 01:47:46.293
BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO PUTTING

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:47.961
DOWN THE TRACK BUT THAT TRACK IS

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:49.462
FULLY SUITABLE FOR HIGH SPEED

01:47:49.529 --> 01:47:51.198
TRAINS.

01:47:51.264 --> 01:47:53.066
THAT TRACK WON'T CHANGE WHAT

01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:54.968
WILL BE ADDED THEN AS PART OF

01:47:55.035 --> 01:47:56.336
THE THAT.

01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:58.738
LATER PHASES THE ELECTRIFICATION

01:47:58.805 --> 01:47:59.639
OF THAT WITHOUT THE

01:47:59.706 --> 01:48:02.242
ELECTRIFICATION IT DOESN'T WORK

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:04.211
FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL TRUE OR NOT.

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:05.712
WHAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE WE'RE

01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:07.547
IT'S PART OF THE COST IT'S PART

01:48:07.614 --> 01:48:09.616
OF THE THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

01:48:09.683 --> 01:48:11.551
IS THE ELECTRIFICATION THERE

01:48:11.618 --> 01:48:13.753
AGAIN THE THE CONCERN I AM

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:14.888
RAISING HERE IS CENTRAL

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:16.056
CALIFORNIA?

01:48:16.122 --> 01:48:18.225
HAS BEEN THE BEGINNING PIG IN

01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:20.727
ALL OF THIS AND WE HAVE HAD

01:48:20.794 --> 01:48:22.195
THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF PRIME AG.

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:25.098
TORN UP WE HAVE -- LOTS OF OUR

01:48:25.165 --> 01:48:26.967
STREETS AND ROADS AT THAT TORN

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:27.701
UP.

01:48:27.767 --> 01:48:29.636
WE HAVE THESE CONCRETE MONUMENTS

01:48:29.703 --> 01:48:31.104
TO HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:32.539
AND YET.

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:33.874
BY THIS.

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:36.142
ADMITTANCE BY THE PLAN IN FRONT

01:48:36.209 --> 01:48:36.977
OF US.

01:48:37.043 --> 01:48:38.211
YOU'RE GONNA PUT PLAIN RAIL UP

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.579
THERE AND YOU'RE GONNA RUN SLOW

01:48:39.646 --> 01:48:42.182
SPEED FOR WHAT A DECADE OR MORE.

01:48:42.249 --> 01:48:44.017
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:45.318
KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PROJECT

01:48:45.385 --> 01:48:47.721
UPDATE REPORT IS IS TO BUILD THE

01:48:47.787 --> 01:48:49.623
HIGH SPEED RAIL -- CAPABLE

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:51.925
SYSTEM AND THE PROJECT UPDATE

01:48:51.992 --> 01:48:53.593
REPORT INDICATES THAT -- YOU'D

HAVE SERVICE RUNNING FOR MERCED

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:57.364
TO BAKERSFIELD HIGH SPEED

01:48:57.430 --> 01:49:00.800
SERVICE -- BY THE END OF TWENTY

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:01.334
TWENTY SEVEN AND THEN THE

01:49:01.401 --> 01:49:03.236
EXTENSION NUMBER SAID BY THE END

01:49:03.303 --> 01:49:04.804
OF TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN THAT.

01:49:04.871 --> 01:49:05.505
THAT.

THE NBC BAY AREA MAY.

01:49:22.989 --> 01:49:24.891
THIRD STORY THESE ARE QUOTES

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:26.826
DIRECTLY OUT OF THE STORE THIS

01:49:26.893 --> 01:49:27.294
IS.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.496
SOME VERY GOOD INVESTIGATIVE

01:49:29.562 --> 01:49:30.096
JOURNALISM AND I MIGHT SUGGEST

01:49:30.163 --> 01:49:31.031
THAT.

01:49:31.097 --> 01:49:35.168
WE BASICALLY GET -- ACCURACY

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:35.468
[inaudible]

01:49:35.535 --> 01:49:38.204
FROM.

01:49:38.271 --> 01:49:40.440
THE MEDIA AND FROM OUR AUDITOR

01:49:40.507 --> 01:49:42.442
WE RARELY GET ACCURACY FROM

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:42.742
[inaudible]

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:45.011
THIS AUTHORITY.

01:49:45.078 --> 01:49:45.979
AT THE PRESENT RATE OF

01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:47.280
CONSTRUCTION HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:49:47.347 --> 01:49:48.882
CANNOT MAKE THE FEDERAL DEADLINE

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:51.051
USE THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE STORY.

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:52.118
HIGH SPEED RAIL NEEDS TO BE

01:49:52.185 --> 01:49:53.553
SPENDING A HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:54.721
NINE MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH TO

01:49:54.788 --> 01:49:56.323
REACH THE TARGET DEADLINE.

01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:58.391
AND THEY SAY AS OF MAY THIRD YOU

01:49:58.458 --> 01:50:01.394
ONLY HIT THAT TARGET ONCE.

01:50:01.461 --> 01:50:02.295
AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WAS

01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:04.898
CONSTRUCTING THREE TIMES SLOWER

01:50:04.965 --> 01:50:05.699
THAN THE NECESSARY.

01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:07.567
PACE.

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:09.269
AND WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING WAS

01:50:09.336 --> 01:50:11.204
IN THIS STORY ACCORDING TO THREE

01:50:11.271 --> 01:50:13.239
HSR OFFICIALS WHO DID NOT WANT

01:50:13.306 --> 01:50:14.975
TO BE QUOTED FOR FEAR.

01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:17.911
OF RETRIBUTION THAT THEY'LL MISS.

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:20.046
AND THAT THE DEADLINE

01:50:20.113 --> 01:50:20.347
[inaudible]

01:50:20.413 --> 01:50:23.149
BY YEARS [inaudible]

01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:26.052
YOU YOU.

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.988
SO I THINK I NOT ONLY ARE YOU I

01:50:28.054 --> 01:50:29.422
THINK YOU'RE RISKING THE PROP

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:30.090
ONE A BUT I THINK YOU'RE RISKING

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:31.157
THE FEDERAL.

01:50:31.224 --> 01:50:33.560
MONEY AND I THINK GIVEN THE

01:50:33.626 --> 01:50:36.129
MANNER IN WHICH THESE PLANNED.

01:50:36.196 --> 01:50:37.364
IS.

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:39.332
VERY ALMOST -- ANNUALLY OR

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:42.335
BIANNUALLY -- I THINK YOU'RE

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:43.970
RUNNING INTO VERY SERIOUS --

01:50:44.037 --> 01:50:45.739
CREDIBILITY PROBLEMS WITH --

01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:48.341
WITH THE FEDERAL.

01:50:48.408 --> 01:50:49.109
THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE I DON'T

01:50:49.175 --> 01:50:50.043
THINK.

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:51.611
I DON'T I THINK THAT.

01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:53.480
ANYBODY THAT LOOKS AT WHAT IS

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:55.081
BEFORE US HAS TO HAVE A REAL

01:50:55.148 --> 01:50:57.550
GRAY RESERVATIONS THAT YOU'RE

01:50:57.617 --> 01:50:58.118
GOING TO MEET THESE KIND OF

01:50:58.184 --> 01:50:59.052
DEADLINES.

01:50:59.119 --> 01:51:00.253
WHEN WE LOOK BACKWARDS YOU'VE

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.957
NEVER MET DEADLINES OF COST --

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:05.992
BUT BEFORE NEVER MET DEADLINES

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:07.427
OF COMPLETION.

01:51:07.494 --> 01:51:09.162
BEFORE WHY SHOULD WE HAVE

01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:10.363
CONFIDENCE THAT YOU CAN THE

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:11.831
DEADLINE.

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:14.067
COMPLETIONS THAT PUT IF YOU

01:51:14.134 --> 01:51:15.368
DON'T MEET THEM WILL PUT AT RISK

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:17.470
BILLIONS OF A FEDERAL

01:51:17.537 --> 01:51:17.771
[inaudible]

01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:20.807
DOLLARS.

01:51:20.874 --> 01:51:25.445
BUT THE THE SCHEDULE OF THE

01:51:25.512 --> 01:51:26.212
TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS A IS A

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:29.783
CHALLENGING SCHEDULE BUT THE

PROJECT ON THE GROUND AND SOME

01:51:32.218 --> 01:51:34.254
OF THE RISK AND THE INFORMATION

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.022
THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORTS SHOW

01:58:46.719 --> 01:58:47.954
THERE'S CONTINGENCIES FOR CUT

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:50.089
OVER RAIL TO AMTRAK AND THINGS

01:58:50.156 --> 01:58:51.624
LIKE THAT.

01:58:51.691 --> 01:58:52.859
BUT WHAT.

01:58:52.925 --> 01:58:54.427
IS PROPOSED HERE BECAUSE I THINK

01:58:54.494 --> 01:58:56.329
IT'S VERY CONSISTENT WITH PROP

01:58:56.395 --> 01:58:59.098
ONE NAY IS TO BUILD HIGH SPEED

01:58:59.165 --> 01:58:59.298
RAIL.

01:58:59.365 --> 01:59:01.801
AND SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:03.503
WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE OPTIMAL%

01:59:03.569 --> 01:59:04.971
USE OF THE FUNDS WE HAVE

01:59:05.037 --> 01:59:07.773
AVAILABLE TO COMPLETE THE BEST A

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:09.442
HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT THAT CAN

01:59:09.509 --> 01:59:11.043
BE ACHIEVED WITH THE FUNDING

01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:12.578
AVAILABLE AND AGAIN.

01:59:12.645 --> 01:59:13.913
BELIEVE THAT SAY.

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:15.314
HIGH QUALITY HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:17.049
LINE OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE

01:59:17.116 --> 01:59:19.485
MILES SO WE STAND BESIDE SO YOU

01:59:19.552 --> 01:59:21.721
ARE YOU ARE -- ESSENTIALLY

01:59:21.787 --> 01:59:24.223
SAYING THAT.

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:27.460
JOE HEDGES AND HIS COMMENTS ON

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:28.828
THE PUBLIC RECORD IN AN

01:59:28.895 --> 01:59:30.096
INVESTIGATIVE.

01:59:30.162 --> 01:59:31.631
STORY THAT SAID YOU PUT IN PLAIN

01:59:31.697 --> 01:59:33.499
RAIL UP THERE AND KNOW WHAT

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:36.469
PROBABLY WILL NOT BE HIGH SPEED.

01:59:36.536 --> 01:59:37.870
KNOW WHO'S TELLING US THE TRUTH.

01:59:37.937 --> 01:59:39.438
WHAT WHAT IS BEING BUILT IS IS

01:59:39.505 --> 01:59:41.641
HIGH SPEED RAIL AGAIN IT'S GETS

01:59:41.707 --> 01:59:42.508
TO THE PHASING?

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:44.644
THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TIMELINE

01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:46.145
DOESN'T REQUIRE THE

01:59:46.212 --> 01:59:47.280
ELECTRIFICATION THEY CAN'T

01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:48.548
MERRY'S BE BUILT ON THAT

01:59:48.614 --> 01:59:49.782
SCHEDULE.

01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:50.950
BUT THOSE ARE PART OF THE

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:53.152
FUNDING PLAN AND THAT IS WHAT IS

01:59:53.219 --> 01:59:55.621
PROPOSED IS TO BUILD ELECTRIFIED

01:59:55.688 --> 01:59:56.656
HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:59:56.722 --> 01:59:58.391
DO YOU HAVE IT ARE YOU PLANNING

01:59:58.457 --> 02:00:00.793
TO BUY ANY HIGH SPEED EQUIPMENT

02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:03.663
OR ARE ARE DOES THAT WAIT.

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:06.465
UNTIL SUNDAY DECK MAYBE A DECADE

02:00:06.532 --> 02:00:08.067
FROM NOW YOU HAVE THE MONEY.

02:00:08.134 --> 02:00:10.436
TO MAKE PLAIN RAIL HIGH SPEED.

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:13.172
WHAT'S WHAT'S GONNA RUN ON THIS

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:13.372
THING.

02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:14.106
WHEN YOU?

02:00:14.173 --> 02:00:16.042
OPEN IT UP AND CALL THAT AN

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:17.677
INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT.

02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:20.112
ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE

02:00:20.179 --> 02:00:21.881
THE ADVANTAGES OF HIGH SPED

02:00:21.948 --> 02:00:23.849
RAIL AND WHEN YOU PUT PLAIN

02:00:23.916 --> 02:00:26.586
TRACK ON IT AND THERE'S A EIGHT

02:00:26.652 --> 02:00:27.653
NINE TEN YEAR WINDOW.

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:29.088
WHERE WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE THAT

02:00:29.155 --> 02:00:31.123
YOU ELECTRIFY IN THAT PERIOD OF

02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:32.525
TIME AS MISTER PATTERSON AND IF

02:00:32.592 --> 02:00:33.893
YOU MISTER AND IF YOU MISSED THE

02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.595
DEADLINE YOU HAVE FUND ISSUES

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.163
WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT A QUEUE

02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:38.898
YOU'RE ASKING QUESTIONS THAT

02:00:38.965 --> 02:00:41.000
HAVE ALREADY BEEN -- ANSWER BUT

02:00:41.067 --> 02:00:43.603
IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE A A

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:49.141
RELATIVE ZERO THAT'S MISTER

02:00:49.208 --> 02:00:49.775
JENNER AND THINK THE ANSWERS OF

02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:51.777
THAT ACT.

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:53.145
AND YOU AND THEY ARE AT FINAL

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:53.746
QUESTION THE PLAN DOES INCLUDE

02:00:53.813 --> 02:00:54.580
FUNDING FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:55.715
TRAINS.

02:00:55.781 --> 02:00:56.749
AND A MAINTENANCE FACILITY FOR

02:00:56.816 --> 02:00:58.217
THOSE TRAINS [inaudible]

02:00:58.284 --> 02:01:03.189
AS RIVAS -- CAN YOU PLEASE

02:01:03.255 --> 02:01:06.692
EXPLAIN AGAIN EXACTLY HOW THIS

02:01:06.759 --> 02:01:09.428
PROJECT UPDATE -- CAME UP WITH

02:01:09.495 --> 02:01:11.397
TOTAL FUNDING AVAILABLE OF WHAT

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:14.100
TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION

02:01:14.166 --> 02:01:14.400
[inaudible]

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:15.735
YEAH.

02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:17.336
SO IN THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH

02:01:17.403 --> 02:01:18.571
OUR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

02:01:18.638 --> 02:01:19.939
BUSINESS PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND

02:01:20.006 --> 02:01:21.040
EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN WE HAD

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:22.875
RANGES OF WHAT FUNDING COMMENT

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.443
MAINLY DUE TO THE FLUCTUATION OF

02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:26.012
CAP AND TRADE EVERY YEAR.

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:27.947
SO IN THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT

02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:29.415
WE REALLY FOCUSED ON TWO

02:01:29.482 --> 02:01:31.384
SCENARIOS -- WE HAVE A LOS

02:01:31.450 --> 02:01:33.386
SCENARIO WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.920
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS.

02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:36.122
AND THAT BASICALLY SCENARIO

02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:37.123
SAYING THAT CAP AND TRADE WILL

02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:39.191
COME IN AT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:40.593
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- WE

02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:41.961
HAVE A HIGH SCENARIO THAT

02:01:42.028 --> 02:01:43.129
ASSUMES THAT CAP AND TRADE WILL

02:01:43.195 --> 02:01:44.697
COME IN AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:45.698
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:01:45.765 --> 02:01:47.633
WHICH BRINGS THAT UP TO TWENTY

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:48.234
THREE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION

02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:50.269
DOLLARS -- ANYWHERE WITHIN THAT

02:01:50.336 --> 02:01:51.604
RANGE WE FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:53.339
THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED

02:01:53.406 --> 02:01:54.607
THE WERE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD --

02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:55.875
BUT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT CAP

02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:57.376
AND TRADE COMES AND WE DO

02:01:57.443 --> 02:01:57.943
MONITOR THAT ON A QUARTERLY

02:01:58.010 --> 02:02:00.179
BASIS -- I CAN TELL YOU AS OF

02:02:00.246 --> 02:02:03.315
TODAY OUR ACTUAL DOLLARS -- WERE

02:02:03.382 --> 02:02:04.216
ACTUALLY COME IN HIGHER THAN

02:02:04.283 --> 02:02:05.484
WHAT OUR HIGHEST PROJECTIONS ARE

02:02:05.551 --> 02:02:07.620
WE SHOULD BE AT ABOUT NINE POINT

02:02:07.687 --> 02:02:08.688
SEVEN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:10.556
THAT'S EXACTLY WILL ROUTE TODAY --

02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:11.724
SO CAPTURE IT IS ACTUALLY COMING

02:02:11.791 --> 02:02:12.792
IN A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN A

02:02:12.858 --> 02:02:14.026
HIGH ASSESSMENT.

02:02:14.093 --> 02:02:15.428
HOWEVER WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:18.831
AND WE DO MONITOR THAT QUARTERLY

02:02:18.898 --> 02:02:19.432
EVERY TIME AN OPTION COMES IN

02:02:19.498 --> 02:02:19.732
[inaudible]

02:02:19.799 --> 02:02:21.801
YEAH -- OKAY THINKS AND CAN NOW

02:02:21.867 --> 02:02:23.335
KEEP PLEASE WALK ME THROUGH HOW

02:02:23.402 --> 02:02:24.470
YOU DETERMINE.

02:02:24.537 --> 02:02:26.005
OF THE ANTICIPATED AMOUNT OF

02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:28.040
FUNDING THAT YOU EXPECT TO BE

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:30.209
AVAILABLE TO COMPLETE.

02:02:30.276 --> 02:02:32.011
THE ENTRANCE SEGMENT.

02:02:32.078 --> 02:02:34.113
SURE SO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:35.314
HAVE ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE

02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:36.849
BILLION DOLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS

02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:38.884
THAT WERE VERY AWARE OF WE HAVE

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:39.785
THE PROPER NAY NINE BILLION

02:02:39.852 --> 02:02:41.454
DOLLARS JUST ABOUT FOUR POINT

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.054
TWO BILLION THAT.

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:43.589
WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO OF THAT

02:02:43.656 --> 02:02:44.690
NINE BILLION.

02:02:44.757 --> 02:02:45.458
AND THEN THE REST IS CAP AND

02:02:45.524 --> 02:02:47.059
TRADE THE OPTIONS THAT COME IN

02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:47.793
EVERY QUARTER.

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:49.695
SO PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF OUR

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:51.797
FUNDING IS WE HAVE THE PROBLEM A

02:02:51.864 --> 02:02:53.065
FUNDS OF AGAIN NINE BILLION

02:02:53.132 --> 02:02:55.134
DOLLARS WE HAVE THE FEDERAL

02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:55.868
FUNDS OF THREE POINT FIVE FIVE

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:56.602
BILLION.

02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:58.537
BUT THAT THE CHALLENGES THE CAP

02:02:58.604 --> 02:02:59.972
AND TRADE BECAUSE THAT COMES IN

02:03:00.039 --> 02:03:02.341
ON A QUARTERLY BASIS -- AND WE

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:04.110
CAN'T REALLY PREDICT WHAT THAT

02:03:04.176 --> 02:03:05.611
WHAT THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT IS NOW

02:03:05.678 --> 02:03:07.113
WHAT I CAN SAY IS WE DO TRACK IT

02:03:07.179 --> 02:03:08.514
VERY CAREFULLY.

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:09.815
AND IT'S ACTUALLY COMING IN

02:03:09.882 --> 02:03:11.150
HIGHER THAN WHAT OUR HIGHEST

02:03:11.217 --> 02:03:12.685
PROJECTIONS ARE.

02:03:12.752 --> 02:03:16.322
SO IT IS A FORECAST ARE FUNDING

02:03:16.388 --> 02:03:16.789
AND AND IT IS SOMEWHAT

02:03:16.856 --> 02:03:18.390
CHALLENGING.

02:03:18.457 --> 02:03:19.425
THANK YOU -- I SAID MAKE A

02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:20.059
COMMENT THAT I THINK IT'S JUST

02:03:20.126 --> 02:03:22.795
CONVENIENT THAT THE COST OF THIS.

02:03:22.862 --> 02:03:25.664
PROPOSED INTERIM SEGMENT IS

02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:26.999
PRECISELY EQUAL TO THEM AN

02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:28.667
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT YOU

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:32.471
EXPECT TO HAVE AVAILABLE. TO

02:03:32.538 --> 02:03:33.205
TWENTY THIRTY IT'S NOT TAKING

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:34.006
ANY.

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:37.042
OF COST OVERRUNS INTO ACCOUNT OR

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:38.844
YOU KNOW THE PROPERTIES HAVE NOT

02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:40.746
BEEN PURCHASED WRITER THE RIGHT

02:03:40.813 --> 02:03:41.847
OF WAYS HAVEN'T BEEN.

02:03:41.914 --> 02:03:44.817
SECURED IS THAT CORRECT SIR SO

02:03:44.884 --> 02:03:46.018
THAT IS PART OF WHAT WE

02:03:46.085 --> 02:03:47.453
DISCUSSED ABOUT ARE CONTINUOUSLY

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.388
AND I GET TO TECHNICAL ON OUR

02:03:49.455 --> 02:03:51.190
OUR SEVENTY P. SEVEN IN A P. TEN

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:52.458
BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT A PIECE OF

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:54.293
INDIA'S WE HAVE A 70% CHANCE OF

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.828
BEING ACCURATE ON OUR BUDGET.

02:03:55.895 --> 02:03:57.296
A 30% CHANCE OF NOT BEING

02:03:57.363 --> 02:03:59.064
ACCURATE -- THE WAY WE GOT TO

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:00.833
OUR BUDGET IS TO ADD ABOUT NINE

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:01.801
HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION

02:04:01.867 --> 02:04:03.936
DOLLARS OF CONTINGENCY -- WHAT

02:04:04.003 --> 02:04:05.171
THE WAY I LOOK AT THAT IS IT'S

02:04:05.237 --> 02:04:06.939
IT'S MONEY SET ASIDE FOR THOSE

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.274
REST THAT WE NOW WE HAVE

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:10.042
MEDICATIONS FOR BUT IT MIGHT NOT

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.676
WORK?

02:04:10.743 --> 02:04:11.911
OR EVEN THOSE UNKNOWN REST THAT

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:13.245
WE'RE NOT AWARE OF BUT THAT'S A

02:04:13.312 --> 02:04:16.348
BIG PART THAT'S YOU KNOW THE 70%

02:04:16.415 --> 02:04:16.916
17% INCREASE IN THE CENTRAL

02:04:16.982 --> 02:04:17.917
VALLEY.

02:04:17.983 --> 02:04:19.618
ABOUT 9% OF THAT IS JUST

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:21.453
ADDITIONAL CONTINGENCY FUNDS TO

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.354
MITIGATE THOSE RISKS THAT WE'RE

02:04:22.421 --> 02:04:26.759
AWARE OF OR THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE

02:04:26.826 --> 02:04:29.128
AWARE OF KATE.

02:04:29.195 --> 02:04:29.628
SO.

02:04:29.695 --> 02:04:30.362
I REPRESENT THE THIRTY NINTH

02:04:30.429 --> 02:04:32.631
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH WHICH

02:04:32.698 --> 02:04:34.733
THE THE SEGMENTS THE SOUTHERN

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:37.236
SEGMENT OF THE RAIL THE ORIGINAL

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:40.105
VISION -- WERE TO GO THROUGH --

DISTRICTS LIKE MINE OR ANYTHING

02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:54.220
IF THIS IS.

02:04:54.286 --> 02:04:56.355
THE STRUCTURE OF STATEWIDE RAIL

02:04:56.422 --> 02:04:57.957
INVESTMENT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN

02:04:58.023 --> 02:04:59.391
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S NOT HIGH

02:04:59.458 --> 02:05:01.126
SPEED RAIL ALONE BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:05:01.193 --> 02:05:03.095
MANY AREAS WERE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:03.896
WON'T.

02:05:03.963 --> 02:05:05.731
REACH THE I WON'T YOU KNOW GET

02:05:05.798 --> 02:05:07.299
TO THOSE CITIES SO FAR HAS BEEN

02:05:07.366 --> 02:05:08.300
LOOKING AT THE IDEA OF A

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:10.302
STATEWIDE RAIL MODERNIZATION

02:05:10.369 --> 02:05:11.470
APPROACH.

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:13.205
AND THAT'S BEEN REFLECTED IN IN

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:14.540
SEVERAL WAYS AND SEVERAL NEW

02:05:14.607 --> 02:05:16.375
FUNDING PROGRAMS OF COURSE THE

02:05:16.442 --> 02:05:19.411
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM OF TWENTY

02:05:19.478 --> 02:05:20.880
FOURTEEN A SET UP A NEW FUNDING

02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:22.014
PROGRAM.

02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:24.383
IN SB ONE AUGMENTED THAT AS WELL

02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:25.951
SO WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS ALL OF

02:05:26.018 --> 02:05:27.286
THE DIFFERENT STATE FUNDING

02:05:27.353 --> 02:05:29.255
SOURCES PRIMARILY THE CAP AND

02:05:29.321 --> 02:05:31.390
TRADE IN SB ONE WITH ALONG WITH

02:05:31.457 --> 02:05:33.058
A LITTLE HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT'S

02:05:33.125 --> 02:05:34.093
THE BOOK IN MONEY.

02:05:34.159 --> 02:05:35.394
I SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RAIL

02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:37.529
INVESTMENTS ARE ABOUT FOUR POINT

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:39.265
FOUR BILLION DOLLARS -- THAT

02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:41.901
WE'VE SEEN OVER THIS PAST PERIOD

02:05:41.967 --> 02:05:45.037
DOES SINCE -- TWENTY FOURTEEN

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:46.071
AND IN THAT INCLUDES SAY AGAIN

02:05:46.138 --> 02:05:48.140
BUT SOME OF THE NEW SB ONE MONEY

02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:49.041
THAT STILL COMING IN BUT THOSE

02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:51.710
ARE AWARDED PROJECTS TO IMPROVE

02:05:51.777 --> 02:05:53.746
METROLINK -- SURFLINER ALL THOSE

02:05:53.812 --> 02:05:55.915
RAIL SERVICES AT THE CENTRAL

02:05:55.981 --> 02:05:57.416
VALLEY SERVICE AND MANY

02:05:57.483 --> 02:05:59.318
TRAVELERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:05:59.385 --> 02:06:01.186
WILL ALSO CHOOSE TO USE THE

02:06:01.253 --> 02:06:03.055
EXISTING BUS CONNECTION TO GET

02:06:03.122 --> 02:06:04.723
DOWN TO LOS ANGELES AS WELL.

02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:06.825
SO SOME OF THE TRAVELER'S COMING

02:06:06.892 --> 02:06:08.827
TO AND FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:06:08.894 --> 02:06:09.962
WOULD CHOOSE TO USE.

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:11.230
THE CENTRAL VALLEY RAIL AS THEY

02:06:11.297 --> 02:06:15.768
DO TODAY BUT IT MUCH EXPANDED

02:06:15.834 --> 02:06:19.038
NUMBERS -- GIVE A PROJECTION ON

02:06:19.104 --> 02:06:19.972
HOW.

02:06:20.039 --> 02:06:21.640
THOSE EXPANDED NUMBERS LAKE YES

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:22.641
THAT'S HOW MUCH.

02:06:22.708 --> 02:06:25.010
HOW MUCH DOES THIS REDUCE THE

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:26.979
TRIP TIME SURE CAN ALSO DOES

02:06:27.046 --> 02:06:28.280
DOES THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:31.116
WRITING RAIL TODAY THAT TO PASS

02:06:31.183 --> 02:06:32.851
THROUGH OR WITHIN THAT

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:34.453
BAKERSFIELD MERCED SEGMENT WOULD

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:38.090
SAVE NINETY TO A HUNDRED MINUTES?

02:06:38.157 --> 02:06:40.259
OF TRIP TIME -- ANDY AT THE

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:43.595
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ARE IN THE THE

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:45.331
EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR REPORT

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:46.732
WHICH IS ON HIGH SPEED RAILS

02:06:46.799 --> 02:06:48.267
WEBSITE BUT AT THE TIME HIGH

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:49.301
LEVEL WHAT ABOUT.

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:51.470
DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS

02:06:51.537 --> 02:06:53.739
LOOKING ACROSS THE THREE

02:06:53.806 --> 02:06:54.707
SERVICES.

02:06:54.773 --> 02:06:56.809
THE EIGHT THE ALTAMONT COMMUTER

02:06:56.875 --> 02:06:59.178
EXPRESS THE SAN JOAQUIN'S WILL

02:06:59.244 --> 02:07:01.480
BE OPERATING AS HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:03.349
AND THEN THOSE BUS CONNECTIONS

02:07:03.415 --> 02:07:04.483
FROM BAKERSFIELD TO SOUTHERN

02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:05.617
CALIFORNIA.

02:07:05.684 --> 02:07:07.453
BUT WITH THE BUS CONNECTIONS ARE

02:07:07.519 --> 02:07:09.455
THEY REALLY SAVING NINETY TWO

02:07:09.521 --> 02:07:10.222
HUNDRED MINUTES.

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.523
WELL AGAIN FOR THOSE EXISTING

02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:13.359
PASSENGERS THAT WOULD START IN

02:07:13.425 --> 02:07:14.860
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WANT TO

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:16.395
TAKE A A RAIL TRIP TO SAY

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:19.765
SACRAMENTO -- CURRENTLY THERE'S

02:07:19.832 --> 02:07:23.535
DICKEY GO THE COASTAL RAIL ROUTE

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:24.370
AND THAT.

02:07:24.436 --> 02:07:26.372
TAKES A THINK ABOUT ELEVEN HOURS

02:07:26.438 --> 02:07:27.373
TO GET TO HAVE FROM MY LOS

02:07:27.439 --> 02:07:28.640
ANGELES UP TO SACRAMENTO

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:30.743
SLIGHTLY SHORTER IF YOU TAKE THE

02:07:30.809 --> 02:07:32.444
BUS CONNECTION FROM LA TO

02:07:32.511 --> 02:07:33.879
BAKERSFIELD AND GET AND GET ON

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:35.814
THE TRAIN AT BAKERSFIELD TO GO

02:07:35.881 --> 02:07:36.582
TO SACRAMENTO.

02:07:36.648 --> 02:07:38.650
SO THAT THAT THAT PARTICULAR

02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:40.319
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRAVELER

02:07:40.386 --> 02:07:41.687
WOULD SEE AN INCREASE.

02:07:41.754 --> 02:07:43.622
OR DECREASE RATHER IN TRIP TIME

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:45.324
BY THAT NINETY TWO HUNDRED

02:07:45.391 --> 02:07:47.393
MINUTES.

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:48.961
YOU KNOW I NOTICED THAT YOUR

02:07:49.028 --> 02:07:50.896
PROJECT UPDATE -- HAD NO

02:07:50.963 --> 02:07:53.966
ALTERNATIVES PROPOSED OF MEA

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:55.300
THE ONLY OPTION THAT YOUR

02:07:55.367 --> 02:07:56.502
PRESENT TEAM.

02:07:56.568 --> 02:07:58.637
IS THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD YOU

02:07:58.704 --> 02:07:59.805
KNOW AS A LEGISLATOR I WOULD

02:07:59.872 --> 02:08:01.607

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:05.911
NOW.

02:08:05.978 --> 02:08:06.745
OF SOMETHING THAT THE

02:08:06.812 --> 02:08:08.947
LEGISLATURE HAS TO CONSIDER --

02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:11.050
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:13.285
MORE OPTIONS IN EUROPE.

02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:14.987
PROJECT UPDATE SURE APPRECIATE

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:17.056
THAT YET THE GIVEN THE THE

02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:18.857
FRAMING IT WAS COMMITMENTS MADE

02:08:18.924 --> 02:08:20.359
AT THE TIME OF THE TWENTY

02:08:20.426 --> 02:08:21.326
EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN TO LOOK

02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:22.828
AT THAT VALLEY TO VALLEY AND

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:24.363
LOOK AT THE BUILD OUT ON EITHER

02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:26.532
END OF VALLEY TO VALLEY AND HOW

02:08:26.598 --> 02:08:26.999
WE COULD DO THAT IN.

02:08:27.066 --> 02:08:28.801
A ROOM SERVICE GET THROUGH OUR

02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:30.569
BROADER RAIL MODERNIZATION

02:08:30.636 --> 02:08:31.804
EFFORTS WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF

02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:34.173
WORK ON IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:35.841
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA --

02:08:35.908 --> 02:08:37.776
THERE WAS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS

02:08:37.843 --> 02:08:39.812
PROVIDED FOR THE CALL THIS THE

02:08:39.878 --> 02:08:41.847
SCORE PROJECT THAT METROLINX

02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:43.515
LOOKING AT FOR HOW TO UPGRADE A

02:08:43.582 --> 02:08:44.817
NUMBER OF LINES INCREASE

02:08:44.883 --> 02:08:46.351
FREQUENCY TO SOMETHING LIKE

02:08:46.418 --> 02:08:47.920
EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES ON SOME OF

02:08:47.986 --> 02:08:49.488
THE MOST TRAVELED LINES DOWN

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:50.122
THERE.

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:52.057
SO THERE IS WORK BEING DONE ON

02:08:52.124 --> 02:08:53.992
ON THOSE TYPE OF IMPROVEMENTS AS

02:08:54.059 --> 02:08:55.394
WELL AND AGAIN IT'S THEY'RE NOT

02:08:55.461 --> 02:08:58.063
DEPENDENT ON HIGH SPEED RAIL --

02:08:58.130 --> 02:08:59.565
COMING INTO THOSE CORRIDORS BUT

02:08:59.631 --> 02:09:02.134
THEIR MUTUAL BENEFIT PROJECTS

02:09:02.201 --> 02:09:08.440
THAT -- AT THE THE L. UNION

02:09:08.507 --> 02:09:10.709
STATION THE ROSECRANS MARQUARDT

02:09:10.776 --> 02:09:11.743
WINDOWS FREE OUT MORE GRADE

02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:12.811
SEPARATED SEGMENTS IN SOME CASES

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:14.680
ALLOW FOR MORE CONTINUOUS THIRD

02:09:14.746 --> 02:09:15.347
TRACK.

02:09:15.414 --> 02:09:16.849
OF THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT

02:09:16.915 --> 02:09:19.084
IMPROVE THE EXISTING RAIL

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:20.552
SERVICES TODAY.

02:09:20.619 --> 02:09:22.254
ARE YOU KNOW.

02:09:22.321 --> 02:09:24.223
THERE IS NO PROPOSED STOP IN MY

02:09:24.289 --> 02:09:26.325
DISTRICT YOU KNOW THE THE THE

02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:28.927
RAIL -- JUST GOES RIGHT THROUGH

02:09:28.994 --> 02:09:32.631
IT -- AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE --

02:09:32.698 --> 02:09:34.533
MY CONSTITUENTS WOULD EVEN BE

02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:37.069
ABLE TO AFFORD -- THE HIGH SPEED

02:09:37.136 --> 02:09:39.905
RAIL -- IF IT THERE WERE A STOP

02:09:39.972 --> 02:09:43.208
IN THE DISTRICT -- IN SO THAT'S

02:09:43.275 --> 02:09:45.310
WHAT I THINK OF WHEN I SEE THIS

02:09:45.377 --> 02:09:49.515
PROJECT -- I THINK OF OF WHETHER.

02:09:49.581 --> 02:09:51.517
YOU KNOW PEOPLE YOU KNOW MY MY

02:09:51.583 --> 02:09:53.051
DISTRICT IS MMHM -- PRIMARILY

02:09:53.118 --> 02:09:56.021
LOW INCOME -- YOU KNOW THE HOUSE

02:09:56.088 --> 02:09:58.790
CURRENTLY NO TRANSIT CORRIDORS

02:09:58.857 --> 02:10:02.261
VERY LITTLE -- IN MOST PEOPLE.

02:10:02.327 --> 02:10:04.429
ONE TRANSIT WITHIN THIS THE AREA

02:10:04.496 --> 02:10:06.231
THE WITHIN THE REGION YOU KNOW

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:08.066
TO GET TO WORK YOU KNOW TO THIS

02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:09.902
AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE --

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:14.540
AND BUT A PROJECT LIKE THIS --

02:10:14.606 --> 02:10:15.541
WOULD DISRUPT -- YOU DON'T THEIR

02:10:15.607 --> 02:10:19.244
LIVES BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW YET --

02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:21.580
YOU KNOW WHERE WHAT HOMES WILL

02:10:21.647 --> 02:10:23.081
YOU KNOW WHICH FAMILIES WILL BE

02:10:23.148 --> 02:10:26.084
DISPLACED IN IN THE DISTRICT.

02:10:26.151 --> 02:10:27.786
OF IN SO.

02:10:27.853 --> 02:10:29.555
THAT'S WHERE.

02:10:29.621 --> 02:10:31.089
A YOU KNOW MY CONCERNS ARE --

02:10:31.156 --> 02:10:32.891
JUST FOR THE OVERALL VISION OF

02:10:32.958 --> 02:10:36.195
THE PROJECT -- BUT AS FAR AS

02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:38.897
THIS SEGMENT GOES -- I AM ALSO

02:10:38.964 --> 02:10:42.067
CONCERNED -- THE UNCERTAINTY OF

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:43.402
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

02:10:43.468 --> 02:10:46.071
INVOLVEMENT TWITCH I THINK THIS

02:10:46.138 --> 02:10:48.941
PROJECT IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON

02:10:49.007 --> 02:10:50.676
NOT JUST IN.

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:52.444
THE FUNDING OR YOU KNOW THE

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:53.078
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A FUNDING

02:10:53.145 --> 02:10:56.448
SOURCE -- BUT THE NEED FOR

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:58.584
REVIEWS THAT YOU MENTIONED IN

02:10:58.650 --> 02:11:01.086
YOUR UPDATE ORIGINALLY ARE

02:11:01.153 --> 02:11:03.288
SUPPOSED TO BE CONDUCTED.

02:11:03.355 --> 02:11:04.823
AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BERMAN

02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:07.426
VIA MENTAL IMPACT REVIEWS RIGHT.

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:10.095
AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:10.729
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IF.

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:11.797
IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:13.532
CONCURRENTLY.

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:16.235
YOU WON'T MAKE THE DECEMBER

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:16.835
TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE IS

02:11:16.902 --> 02:11:18.770
THAT CORRECT.

02:11:18.837 --> 02:11:19.938
THAT'S CORRECT YEAH AND AND FOR

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:22.941
THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS THAT

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:25.177
ARE CURRENTLY BEING -- UPDATED

02:11:25.244 --> 02:11:26.812
IN THERE'S THERE'S TWO CENTRAL

02:11:26.878 --> 02:11:28.447
VALLEY THERE'S THE BAKERSFIELD

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:29.848
AREA LOCALLY PREFERRED

02:11:29.915 --> 02:11:31.750
ALTERNATIVE AND THEN THERE'S THE

02:11:31.817 --> 02:11:34.820
Y. WHICH IS IN THE MADERA MERCED

02:11:34.886 --> 02:11:35.320
AREA.

02:11:35.387 --> 02:11:36.922
SO BOTH OF THOSE CURRENTLY

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:38.323
BECAUSE OF FEDERAL ENGAGEMENT A

02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:40.792
GOING FIRST IS GOING FOR TO SEE

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:41.426
FOR FIRST.

02:11:41.493 --> 02:11:43.862
SO THERE'S PUBLIC AT HEARINGS IN

02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:45.397
PUBLIC PROCESS ON THE SEQUENCE

02:11:45.464 --> 02:11:46.965
SIDE BUT WITHOUT THE FEDERAL

02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:48.500
GOVERNMENT ENGAGING ON THE KNEE

JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE WE'RE

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:42.507
GOING TO GET.

02:14:42.574 --> 02:14:45.444
EVEN OUR OWN STATE ENGAGED IN

02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:47.379
THIS -- HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:14:47.446 --> 02:14:50.782
PROJECT AND THE WILL TO FUND IT --

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:52.851
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:54.286
UPDATES.

02:14:54.352 --> 02:14:57.088
AND MORE OPTIONS FOR IT FOR THE

BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE --

02:15:03.295 --> 02:15:04.796
I SAID BEFORE IT THE ONLY

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:06.498
PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS

02:15:06.565 --> 02:15:08.400
PAST BEHAVIOR SO I JUST WANT TO

02:15:08.467 --> 02:15:09.401
UNDERSTAND.

02:15:09.468 --> 02:15:10.602
THAT LOW EVERYONE UNDERSTAND

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:12.437
WHAT THE ORIGINAL.

02:15:12.504 --> 02:15:14.172
I INTENT OF PROP WHEN IT WAS SO

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:16.741
DALY OPENED EXPLAINED OR TAKE A

02:15:16.808 --> 02:15:18.944
WHAT THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM A

02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:20.645
DESIGN SYSTEM WAS WAS TO BE.

02:15:20.712 --> 02:15:23.615
SURE SO PROP ONE A ENVISIONED --

02:15:23.682 --> 02:15:25.116
KIND OF TWO PHASES TO THE

02:15:25.183 --> 02:15:27.285
PROJECT SO PHASE ONE WAS TO GO

02:15:27.352 --> 02:15:29.154
FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA

02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:30.889
DOWN TO ANAHEIM PHASE TWO IS TO

02:15:30.956 --> 02:15:32.190
EXTEND FURTHER.

02:15:32.257 --> 02:15:33.492
ON SACRAMENTO IN THE NORTH IN

02:15:33.558 --> 02:15:35.293
SAN DIEGO IN THE SOUTH AND SO

02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:36.895
THAT WAS THE ON THE GENERAL

02:15:36.962 --> 02:15:38.430
BROAD VISION AND THERE IS SOME

02:15:38.497 --> 02:15:39.898
ADDITIONAL SPECIFICITY ALSO LAID

02:15:39.965 --> 02:15:42.300
OUT SO FULLY ELECTRIFIED

02:15:42.367 --> 02:15:43.502
COMPLETELY SEPARATE LINE.

02:15:43.568 --> 02:15:45.704
I I BELIEVE IT WAS INTENDED TO

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:46.738
BE.

02:15:46.805 --> 02:15:47.372
I DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:15:47.439 --> 02:15:49.174
IT READ IT THAT IT SPECIFICALLY

02:15:49.241 --> 02:15:51.309
CALLED OUT WHETHER IT'S TO BE.

02:15:51.376 --> 02:15:52.744
FULLY SEPARATED OR NOT BUT

02:15:52.811 --> 02:15:54.646
CERTAINLY THE IMPLICATION OF THE

02:15:54.713 --> 02:15:55.480
BUILDING UP.

02:15:55.547 --> 02:15:58.216
OF RAIL LINE FROM THOSE POINTS I

02:15:58.283 --> 02:15:59.784
DON'T THINK IT WAS IT WAS SUPER

02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:01.887
STRESSED THAT SPECIFIED IN THE

02:16:01.953 --> 02:16:04.556
IN THE MEASURE OKAY SO BUT AT A

02:16:04.623 --> 02:16:06.825
MINIMUM WE HAVE A LINE THAT GOES

02:16:06.892 --> 02:16:07.792
FROM.

02:16:07.859 --> 02:16:09.027
SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM.

02:16:09.094 --> 02:16:13.131
ELECTRIFIED -- SEPARATE OR

02:16:13.198 --> 02:16:15.300
BLENDED IN SOME FASHION CORRECT.

02:16:15.367 --> 02:16:17.002
I BELIEVE SO YEAH OKAY SO I HEAR

02:16:17.068 --> 02:16:22.941
A LOT OF WORDS LIKE -- RE

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:24.976
FOCUSED.

02:16:25.043 --> 02:16:28.547
DOWNSIZED -- CHANGE SO THAT I TO

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:29.981
AUTHORITY CAN TELL ME IT HAS THE

02:16:30.048 --> 02:16:31.783
GOVERNOR DOWNSIZE THIS PROJECT

02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:33.151
WHAT IS TO THE POSITION OF THE

02:16:33.218 --> 02:16:35.353
ADMINISTRATION ARE WE GOING TO

02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:36.454
STILL DO.

02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:38.356
A SAN FRANCISCO IN ANAHEIM AS

02:16:38.423 --> 02:16:39.524
PROP ONE A VISION A VISION OR

02:16:39.591 --> 02:16:41.626
WHAT IS THE PROJECT IN ITS

02:16:41.693 --> 02:16:43.895
CURRENT FORM SURE. FOR WHAT THE

02:16:43.962 --> 02:16:45.196
GOVERNOR STATED THE STAY

02:16:45.263 --> 02:16:46.898
REFERRED TO NO REGARDING THE

02:16:46.965 --> 02:16:48.867
PROJECT IN LOOKING AT THE MONEY

02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:49.734
WE HAD AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE

02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:50.368
DONE.

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:52.103
SO -- YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE

02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:53.972
PRIOR BUSINESS PLAN TALK ABOUT

02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:55.640
THINGS LIKE EXTENSION OF CAP AND

02:16:55.707 --> 02:16:57.275
TRADE TO TWENTY FIFTY THINGS

02:16:57.342 --> 02:16:59.578
LIKE THAT SO THIS DOESN'T ASSUME

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:00.312
THAT.

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:01.546
THIS JUST LOOKS AT THE CURRENT

02:17:01.613 --> 02:17:02.881
MONEY THAT'S DIRECTED TO HIGH

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:04.382
SPEED RAIL.

02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:06.818
AND WHAT'S -- CITED AS IS

02:17:06.885 --> 02:17:08.887
EARLIER MENTIONED IS SEVEN ABOUT

02:17:08.954 --> 02:17:11.056
TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION FROM

02:17:11.122 --> 02:17:13.191
THE VARIOUS SOURCES WHICH ARE

02:17:13.258 --> 02:17:15.293
ONE A TO CAP AND TRADE IN THE

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:20.265
FEDERAL FUNDS ALREADY -- AWARDED

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:21.766
TO THE PROJECT.

02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:22.767
SO I GUESS THAT'S THE CONFUSION

02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:24.369
I I SAT AND LISTENED TO THE SAY

02:17:24.436 --> 02:17:24.669
THE STATE.

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:25.303
AND AND ALL THE REPORTS

02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:26.338
AFTERWARDS WAS THE GOVERNOR

02:17:26.404 --> 02:17:29.274
DOWNSIZE THE PROJECT SO HAS THE

02:17:29.341 --> 02:17:31.309
GOVERNOR DOWNSIZE THE PROJECT.

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:32.877
NO IT THEY WERE RECOGNIZING THE

02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:34.112
BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH THESE

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:35.413
ARE THE MONIES WE HAVE THIS IS

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:36.581
WHAT WE CAN GET DONE WITH THE

02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:37.716
MONEY WE HAVE.

02:17:37.782 --> 02:17:39.651
IN GETTING THIS DONE AND I THINK

02:17:39.718 --> 02:17:40.819
THIS GETS TO THIS ISSUE THAT

02:17:40.885 --> 02:17:42.687
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON RAISED

02:17:42.754 --> 02:17:43.622
A CREDIBILITY WHO NEED TO

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:44.956
DELIVER THOSE.

02:17:45.023 --> 02:17:47.225
CAPITAL PROJECTS ON THE GROUND

02:17:47.292 --> 02:17:50.228
AND HAVING DELIVERED THAT HAVING.

02:17:50.295 --> 02:17:51.997
AB DEMONSTRATING HIGHS RAIL

02:17:52.063 --> 02:17:53.498
SERVICE BY GETTING THE TRAIN

02:17:53.565 --> 02:17:55.467
SETS GETTING THAT UP AND

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:55.967
OPERATING.

02:17:56.034 --> 02:17:57.702
NO THAT IS THE FIRST BUILDING

02:17:57.769 --> 02:18:00.071
BLOCK AND THINK THAT FOCUS ON

02:18:00.138 --> 02:18:02.540
DELIVERY FOCUS ON BUILDING WHAT

02:18:02.607 --> 02:18:04.175
WE CAN WITH THE EXISTING MONEY.

02:18:04.242 --> 02:18:05.644
THAT'S THE FIRST IMPORTANT STEP

02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:07.612
AND THEN ULTIMATELY YES THAT

02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:09.581
EXTENSION TO THE BAY AREA THAT

02:18:09.648 --> 02:18:12.150
EXTENSION TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:13.685
THAT STILL PART OF THE VISION

02:18:13.752 --> 02:18:16.021
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A FUNDING PATH

02:18:16.087 --> 02:18:17.789
RIGHT NOW TO GET THERE.

02:18:17.856 --> 02:18:18.323
BUT IN GETTING THIS FIRST

02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:19.891
BUILDING BLOCK WERE ADVANCING

02:18:19.958 --> 02:18:22.060
THE SYSTEM AND I BELIEVE THAT AT

02:18:22.127 --> 02:18:22.761
SOME POINT THE FEDERAL

02:18:22.827 --> 02:18:24.095
GOVERNMENT WILL RE ENGAGE

02:18:24.162 --> 02:18:26.564
BECAUSE HIGH SPEED RAIL AROUND

02:18:26.631 --> 02:18:27.298
THE COUNTRY.

02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:28.700
YEAH THERE'S INCREASING INTEREST

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:30.235
OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AT THIS

02:18:30.301 --> 02:18:32.437
WELL SO I DO BELIEVE AT SOME

02:18:32.504 --> 02:18:33.905
POINT.

02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:35.340
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL

02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:36.675
RESEARCH THE SO LET LET LET'S

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:41.579
LET'S FOCUS ON THE FUNDING --

02:18:41.646 --> 02:18:42.747
YOU KNOW AS AS MY COLLEAGUE

02:18:42.814 --> 02:18:44.215
MENTIONED BEFORE E. WEBER NO

02:18:44.282 --> 02:18:45.450
MARGIN OF ERROR -- MAG I GET THE

02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:46.451
CONTINGENCY ARGUMENT BUT YOU

02:18:46.518 --> 02:18:47.886
YOUR COST FOR THE CENTER VALLEY

02:18:47.952 --> 02:18:49.587
IS TWENTY POINT FOUR AND YOU'VE

02:18:49.654 --> 02:18:50.989
IDENTIFIED TWENTY POINT.

02:18:51.056 --> 02:18:53.224
FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND AND WE

02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:53.992
ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

02:18:54.059 --> 02:18:55.293
ASSUME.

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:55.960
RIGHT SO [inaudible]

02:18:56.027 --> 02:18:57.896
UNDER.

02:18:57.962 --> 02:18:59.631
THE ON PAGE THIRTY TWO YOU'VE

02:18:59.698 --> 02:19:00.732
INDICATED THAT THE ON GOING

02:19:00.799 --> 02:19:03.401
CONSTRUCTION OF MADERA AND WASCO

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:04.736
HAS INCREASED ONE POINT EIGHT

02:19:04.803 --> 02:19:05.603
BILLION DOLLARS.

02:19:05.670 --> 02:19:06.571
THAT'S CORRECT [inaudible]

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:09.140
AND THEN.

02:19:09.207 --> 02:19:11.676
YES THAT THE PROJECT IT'S A

02:19:11.743 --> 02:19:12.310
DEVICE GOING UP ONE POINT EIGHT

02:19:12.377 --> 02:19:12.911
BILLION.

02:19:12.977 --> 02:19:14.479
INCLUDE YES INCLUDING THE

02:19:14.546 --> 02:19:15.980
CONTINGENCY WE HAVE A BASELINE

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:17.482
COST IS UP ONE POINT EIGHT SO

02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:19.651
THAT'S THE BEST LIKE US WHAT IS

02:19:19.718 --> 02:19:22.554
THE HIGHER RANGE COST.

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:24.322
IT'S THE HIGHER RIGHTS THIRTEEN

02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:25.457
THIRTY THIRTEEN BILLION SO THE

02:19:25.523 --> 02:19:26.357
THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION

02:19:26.424 --> 02:19:27.926
THAT ALSO REPRESENTS THE COST

02:19:27.992 --> 02:19:29.694
FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT ALSO

02:19:29.761 --> 02:19:31.763
THE BOOKENDS INVESTMENTS.

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:33.264
SO AS IT SO JUST TO BE ACCURATE

02:19:33.331 --> 02:19:34.699
WE GOT A RANGE.

02:19:34.766 --> 02:19:35.867
RIGHT AS YOU INDICATED A

02:19:35.934 --> 02:19:39.304
CONTINGENCY SO THE COST COULD BE.

02:19:39.370 --> 02:19:41.139
TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION OR IT

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:43.408
COULD BE THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN

02:19:43.475 --> 02:19:44.609
BILLION NOW LET ME IF I SAID

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:46.644
SOMETHING EARLY I APOLOGIZE THE

02:19:46.711 --> 02:19:47.946
RANGERS ARE FROM THE FUNDING.

02:19:48.012 --> 02:19:49.647
THE FUNDING RANGES ANYWHERE FROM

02:19:49.714 --> 02:19:52.050
TWENTY POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION

02:19:52.117 --> 02:19:53.118
TO TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR FOUR

02:19:53.184 --> 02:19:55.253
BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE RANGE

02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:56.821
FOR THE POTENTIAL FINDING.

02:19:56.888 --> 02:19:58.123
MAINLY DUE THE CAP AND TRADE

02:19:58.189 --> 02:19:59.390
BECAUSE THAT FLUCTUATES.

02:19:59.457 --> 02:20:00.658
THE COST OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:20:00.725 --> 02:20:02.694
DID GO FROM TEN POINT SIX TO

02:20:02.761 --> 02:20:04.763
SEVEN OTHER TWELVE POINT FOUR

02:20:04.829 --> 02:20:05.296
THAT'S THE ONE POINT EIGHT

02:20:05.363 --> 02:20:05.997
BILLION DOLLARS.

02:20:06.064 --> 02:20:08.466
THAT'S ABOUT A 17% INCREASE.

02:20:08.533 --> 02:20:10.735
AND AGAIN OF THAT 17% ABOUT 10%

02:20:10.802 --> 02:20:12.904
OF THAT 9% OF THAT IS THIS

02:20:12.971 --> 02:20:14.172
CONTINGENCY THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:14.539
TALKING ABOUT.

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:17.809
BUT AT THE PREVIOUS YEAR THE

02:20:17.876 --> 02:20:19.077
COST SEGMENT WENT UP TWO POINT

02:20:19.144 --> 02:20:21.146
EIGHT BILLION.

02:20:21.212 --> 02:20:22.447
FROM THE SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN I

02:20:22.514 --> 02:20:24.249
BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT SO SO WE

02:20:24.315 --> 02:20:26.384
ARE NOW SEEING A PATTERN.

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:27.652
YOU DIDN'T DO AGENT DO A COST

02:20:27.719 --> 02:20:30.155
ESTIMATE AT THE BEGINNING A

02:20:30.221 --> 02:20:30.789
TWENTY TWELVE RIGHT AND THEN NOW

02:20:30.855 --> 02:20:34.659
IT'S THERE WAS THE TEN BILLION.

02:20:34.726 --> 02:20:36.528
NOW IT'S TWELVE BILLION.

02:20:36.594 --> 02:20:38.196
WHAT I WOULD EXPLAIN THAT ONE

02:20:38.263 --> 02:20:38.930
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR

02:20:38.997 --> 02:20:41.332
INCREASE FOR THE 17% INCREASE IS?

02:20:41.399 --> 02:20:42.901
AGAIN YOU HAVE ABOUT 9%

02:20:42.967 --> 02:20:44.469
CONTINGENCY I WOULD SAY YOU HAVE

02:20:44.536 --> 02:20:47.272
ABOUT -- THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY

02:20:47.338 --> 02:20:48.273
MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT IS SCOPE

02:20:48.339 --> 02:20:49.641
CHANGE SO WE ADDED SCOPE TO THE

02:20:49.707 --> 02:20:50.575
PROJECT.

02:20:50.642 --> 02:20:51.643
WHICH IS THE ADDITIONAL COSTS

02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:53.178
AND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND

02:20:53.244 --> 02:20:54.145
SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION.

02:20:54.212 --> 02:20:55.847
IS WHAT I WOULD CALL COST

02:20:55.914 --> 02:20:57.649
INCREASES BECAUSE WE KNOW MORE

02:20:57.715 --> 02:20:58.283
ABOUT HOW MUCH SOMETHING'S GOING

02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:59.083
TO COST YOU.

02:20:59.150 --> 02:21:01.820
BUT YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE YOU CAN

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:02.387
GUARANTEE THAT THERE WILL BE

02:21:02.453 --> 02:21:04.355
ANOTHER COST OVER A NO ONE CAN

02:21:04.422 --> 02:21:05.156
GUARANTEE IF IT WILL BE COST YOU

02:21:05.223 --> 02:21:06.791
CRY THAT'S PART OF THE THE THE

02:21:06.858 --> 02:21:07.625
THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A

02:21:07.692 --> 02:21:09.194
CONTINGENCY SO THE LIKELIHOOD OF

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:10.728
A COST OVERRUN IS PRETTY.

02:21:10.795 --> 02:21:13.097
CERTAIN.

02:21:13.164 --> 02:21:15.033
THERE'S A IF IF I AND IF I IF I

02:21:15.099 --> 02:21:16.434
OUTLINED WHAT WHAT IS AND READ

02:21:16.501 --> 02:21:17.769
THIS IS INDICATED.

02:21:17.836 --> 02:21:18.903
IF THE FED THE NEED FOR REVIEW

02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:20.505
ISN'T COMPLETED IF THE FEDS

02:21:20.572 --> 02:21:22.273
DON'T RE ENGAGE IF THE RIGHT

02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:23.908
AWAY ACQUISITION GOES UP IF

02:21:23.975 --> 02:21:25.310
THERE'S LAWSUITS THAT SAY THAT

02:21:25.376 --> 02:21:26.945
YOU KNOW LONGER -- A BYE BYE

02:21:27.011 --> 02:21:28.246
PROP ONE EIGHTY THAT DELAYS THE

02:21:28.313 --> 02:21:30.515
PROJECT THAT ALSO INCREASES

02:21:30.582 --> 02:21:32.617
COSTS CORRECT THE THOSE WOULD BE

02:21:32.684 --> 02:21:33.651
REST YES THAT WOULD.

02:21:33.718 --> 02:21:34.452
ALL THOSE ARE ALL ASSUMPTIONS

02:21:34.519 --> 02:21:37.889
BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM AND INTO

02:21:37.956 --> 02:21:39.057
THIS REPORT.

02:21:39.123 --> 02:21:40.158
WHICH IS WHY THE LA L. AS

02:21:40.225 --> 02:21:41.593
INDICATED THAT THIS REPORT IS

02:21:41.659 --> 02:21:42.627
HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE

02:21:42.694 --> 02:21:43.995
ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE AND THE

02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:46.030
ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE IS VERY

02:21:46.097 --> 02:21:46.965
VERY.

02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:49.801
CONCERNING CORRECT.

02:21:49.868 --> 02:21:51.069
THE ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE OF

02:21:51.135 --> 02:21:52.170
THE REST THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY

02:21:52.237 --> 02:21:54.138
AND YES THE REFEREE ENGAGEMENT

02:21:54.205 --> 02:21:55.573
IS IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS

02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:57.075
PROJECT -- WE DID FACTOR IN THAT

02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:59.410
PIECE -- AND ALL THE OTHER WRIST

02:21:59.477 --> 02:22:02.113
AGAIN WHICH IS WHY WE INCREASED.

02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:04.449
AGAIN WITH IMITATE A P. TEN FROM

02:22:04.515 --> 02:22:05.183
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:06.551
BUSINESS PLAN. TO A PIECE OF A

02:22:06.618 --> 02:22:09.320
NUMBER TO ADDRESS THOSE REST

02:22:09.387 --> 02:22:11.122
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:22:11.189 --> 02:22:12.290
SO THE SO THEN IF YOU DON'T MIND

02:22:12.357 --> 02:22:15.159
ME ASKING WHY DIDN'T YOU DO AB

02:22:15.226 --> 02:22:18.630
SEVENTY OR OR HIGHER ON THE FULL.

02:22:18.696 --> 02:22:20.365
THE FULL ONLINE.

02:22:20.431 --> 02:22:22.100
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS THE MORE

02:22:22.166 --> 02:22:23.935
THIS PROJECT GOES ON THE MORE WE

02:22:24.002 --> 02:22:25.937
NOW UTILITY COSTS -- RIGHT AWAY

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:27.605
COST -- WE LEARN FROM THOSE

02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:29.340
THINGS AND SO I WOULD SAY

02:22:29.407 --> 02:22:30.708
EARLIER ON IN THE PROJECT WOULD

02:22:30.775 --> 02:22:32.143
BE DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH THE

02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:33.945
P. -- SEVENTY BUT I THINK WE

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:35.580
FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE NOW AT

02:22:35.647 --> 02:22:36.147
LEAST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:37.081
PIECE.

02:22:37.148 --> 02:22:38.917
A PIECE OF ANY NUMBER IS IS

02:22:38.983 --> 02:22:40.218
PRETTY ACCURATE WHICH AGAIN.

02:22:40.285 --> 02:22:42.120
WHICH IS THE ONE POINT EIGHT

02:22:42.186 --> 02:22:43.788
BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE.

02:22:43.855 --> 02:22:44.989
SO YOU SAY THAT YOU KEEP CAN'T

02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:46.391
DO A P. SEVENTY FOR THE FULL

02:22:46.457 --> 02:22:48.359
ALIGNMENT OF THE FOR ALIGNMENT

02:22:48.426 --> 02:22:50.194
IF THAT WERE NOW STIPULATING

02:22:50.261 --> 02:22:51.362
THAT THE PROJECT HASN'T CHANGED

02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:52.897
WHAT WE WERE.

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:55.500
WERE BOND BY THAT -- THE NEXT

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:56.067
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY BUSINESS

02:22:56.134 --> 02:22:58.202
PLAN WE WILL HAVE TO DO ANOTHER

02:22:58.269 --> 02:22:59.570
ESTIMATE ON WHAT THE VALUE TO

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:00.171
VALLEY'S GONNA COST AN ACTUAL

02:23:00.238 --> 02:23:01.539
CHANGE ONE'S GOING TO COST SO

02:23:01.606 --> 02:23:02.507
THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THAT

02:23:02.573 --> 02:23:03.641
REPORT TODAY WE DON'T HAVE THAT

02:23:03.708 --> 02:23:07.512
THAT'S AND TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE

02:23:07.578 --> 02:23:08.613
MAKING DECISIONS TODAY.

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:09.580
SO WHY WHY WOULD WHY WASN'T

02:23:09.647 --> 02:23:10.181
THERE DECISION BE MADE THAT

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.482
MAYBE PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

02:23:11.549 --> 02:23:12.517
INFORMATION OF WHY ON THE FULL

02:23:12.583 --> 02:23:14.752
LINE.

02:23:14.819 --> 02:23:16.421
THE TO DO A PIECE OF ANY OR ANY

02:23:16.487 --> 02:23:17.655
TYPE OF ESTIMATE FOR THE VALLEY

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:19.824
VALLEY OR THE PHASE ONE IS GOING

02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:20.959
TO TAKE SOME TIME AGAIN THIS

02:23:21.025 --> 02:23:23.227
PROJECT OF THE REPORT FOCUSED ON

02:23:23.294 --> 02:23:24.629
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WHAT

02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:26.364
WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING TODAY --

02:23:26.431 --> 02:23:28.733
BUT IT IT IS A REQUIREMENT OF

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:29.834
TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN AND

02:23:29.901 --> 02:23:31.769
IT WILL BE THERE BUT WE DON'T

02:23:31.836 --> 02:23:33.438
HAVE THAT INFORMATION TODAY.

02:23:33.504 --> 02:23:34.572
SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE

02:23:34.639 --> 02:23:36.741
INFORMATION TO DO A AT A COST

02:23:36.808 --> 02:23:37.642
ASSESSMENT FOR THE ACTUAL AND WE

02:23:37.709 --> 02:23:38.810
DON'T HAVE WE DON'T WE DON'T

02:23:38.876 --> 02:23:40.878
HAVE THE ANALYSIS DONE. TO BE

02:23:40.945 --> 02:23:41.512
ABLE TO COME UP WITH THAT NUMBER

02:23:41.579 --> 02:23:44.048
TODAY AND SO WE HAVE TO WAIT

02:23:44.115 --> 02:23:45.516
TILL TWENTY TWENTY TO GET THAT

02:23:45.583 --> 02:23:45.817
[inaudible]

02:23:45.883 --> 02:23:51.622
YES AS NOW IN TERMS OF WHAT

02:23:51.689 --> 02:23:52.957
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON

02:23:53.024 --> 02:23:54.826
RELATED TO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME

02:23:54.892 --> 02:23:55.793
WHAT.

02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:58.563
REGIONAL INNER CITY SERVICE IS

02:23:58.629 --> 02:24:01.165
AS USUAL YOU ALLUDED TO IT AND

02:24:01.232 --> 02:24:03.668
ON PAGE.

02:24:03.735 --> 02:24:04.268
SIXTY FOUR SO YEAH YOU'RE NOW

02:24:04.335 --> 02:24:06.471
DOING REGIONAL REGIONAL INNER

02:24:06.537 --> 02:24:08.272
CITY SERVICE.

02:24:08.339 --> 02:24:08.973
ON THIS A LOT ON ON THIS

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:09.674
ALIGNMENT [inaudible]

02:24:09.741 --> 02:24:11.576
SURE [inaudible]

02:24:11.643 --> 02:24:13.745
WHAT ARE?

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:15.013
YOU KNOW WHAT'S PROPOSED.

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:18.282
IS -- BEGIN THAT HUNDRED SEVENTY

02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:19.784
ONE MILE A HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:21.552
SEGMENT THAT'S FULLY INTEGRATED

02:24:21.619 --> 02:24:24.522
WITH THE OTHER RAIL AND IN THE

02:24:24.589 --> 02:24:26.157
SOUTH CAN ADD BUS CONNECTING

02:24:26.224 --> 02:24:27.091
SERVICE.

02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:29.494
AS SO THAT THAT WOULD BE.

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:34.966
DESCRIBED IN THE PLAN IS THE

02:24:35.033 --> 02:24:35.800
IT'S SAFE.

02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:36.534
WHAT WE'RE DESCRIBING THE

02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:38.736
CONNECTIONS OF THE RAIL IS THAT

02:24:38.803 --> 02:24:39.303
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND

02:24:39.370 --> 02:24:40.805

JUST RUNNING TRAINS DIESEL

02:24:43.841 --> 02:24:46.077
TRAINS OR ART AMTRAK TRAINS --

02:24:46.144 --> 02:24:51.682
CONNECTING THE THE CITIES OR

02:24:51.749 --> 02:24:52.183
MAYBE I'M JUST TRYING TO

02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:53.017

GOING TO BE USED SURE.

02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:00.525
SO -- PASSENGER GOING TO SAY

02:25:00.591 --> 02:25:02.093
FROM BAKERSFIELD MERCED WOULD

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.694
GET ON A HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAIN.

02:25:03.761 --> 02:25:05.830
AND THAT TRIP FROM BAKERSFIELD

02:25:05.897 --> 02:25:07.598
MERCED WOULD TAKE SOMETHING LIKE

02:25:07.665 --> 02:25:09.767
AN HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES. FOR

02:25:09.834 --> 02:25:11.235
PASSENGERS THEIR CONTINUING

FURTHER NORTH PERHAPS TO

02:25:13.037 --> 02:25:15.606
SACRAMENTO IN MERCED -- THEY

02:25:15.673 --> 02:25:17.842
WOULD BE ABLE TO BOARD A EITHER

02:25:17.909 --> 02:25:19.744
SAN JOAQUIN OR A STRAIN AND

02:25:19.811 --> 02:25:21.312
CONTINUE THAT TRIP FURTHER NORTH

02:25:21.379 --> 02:25:23.481

INTO THE BAY AREA -- AS WELL TO

02:25:26.050 --> 02:25:30.021
THE ACE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT AND TWENTY

02:25:35.493 --> 02:25:36.060
TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:36.661
THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BUT

02:25:36.727 --> 02:25:38.096
WELL IN THE MEANTIME WHAT IS

02:25:38.162 --> 02:25:40.064
WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THAT AND

SURE FOR THE MEANTIME WE'RE

02:25:41.899 --> 02:25:43.134
CONTINUING TO BUILD THE SYSTEM

02:25:43.201 --> 02:25:45.870
WE'RE CONTINUING TO EXPAND SOUTH

02:25:45.937 --> 02:25:47.972
AT BAKERSFIELD AGAIN -- BY THE

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:49.874
END OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN

02:25:49.941 --> 02:25:50.975
THAT'S WHEN THE BAKERSFIELD

02:25:51.042 --> 02:25:53.111
EXTENSION WAS HIS PLAN TO BE

02:25:53.177 --> 02:25:54.412

GOING TO BE -- CONVENTIONAL RAIL

02:26:02.019 --> 02:26:04.122
BEING USED ON THIS LINE.

02:26:04.188 --> 02:26:05.756
THAT'S CORRECT SO IT'S ALL IT'S

02:26:05.823 --> 02:26:07.191
GOING TO HIGH SPEED FROM THE

02:26:07.258 --> 02:26:08.159
VERY BEGINNING THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:10.661
LOOK CORRECT LOOKING AT GETTING.

02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:12.196
BUILDING ON TO BAKERSFIELD

02:26:12.263 --> 02:26:14.198
BUILDING ON TO MERCED AND HAVING

02:26:14.265 --> 02:26:16.134
THE TRAIN SERVICE BE THE

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:19.036
ELECTRIFIED RAIL SERVICE SO SO

HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:26:26.177 --> 02:26:26.878
THIS ONE AND INITIATE THE HIGH

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:28.946
SPEED RAIL UNTIL THOSE EXTENSION

02:26:29.013 --> 02:26:30.982
TO BAKERSFIELD OCCURS AGAIN THIS

02:26:31.048 --> 02:26:33.384
IS -- WOULD GO FROM MADERA TO

02:26:33.451 --> 02:26:36.053
BAKERSFIELD AS THE FIRST RAIL

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:38.823
SERVICE ON THE NEW AT SYSTEMS

02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:42.660
AND THAT INITIATE BY THE END OF

02:26:42.727 --> 02:26:44.162
TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN SIR WHEN I

02:26:44.228 --> 02:26:48.166
WHEN I READ -- IN THE REPORT.

IS A PASSENGER TRAINS.

02:26:54.105 --> 02:26:56.274
BUT I'M NOT HIGH SPEED.

02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:58.276
OR THE HIGH SPEED.

02:26:58.342 --> 02:26:59.877
NO FOR THAT SEGMENT THAT MADERA

02:26:59.944 --> 02:27:01.479
MADERA TO BAKERSFIELD HIGH SPEED

02:27:01.546 --> 02:27:02.547
TRAINS AND HOW FAST THEY GONNA

02:27:02.613 --> 02:27:04.015
GO.

02:27:04.081 --> 02:27:04.815
WELL THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GO

02:27:04.882 --> 02:27:06.617
OUT THE UP TO TWO HUNDRED MILES

02:27:06.684 --> 02:27:08.853
AN HOUR AT THAT THAT HIGH SPEED.

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:10.521
OKAY SO YOU YOU'RE GOING TO

02:27:10.588 --> 02:27:12.390
GUARANTEE THAT GOES TO HER MILES

02:27:12.456 --> 02:27:13.524
AN HOUR THROUGH BUT FROM BAKER

02:27:13.591 --> 02:27:16.994
TO THE MADERA -- BECAUSE THEY

02:27:17.061 --> 02:27:18.229
THEY GET THIS IS THE WERE

02:27:18.296 --> 02:27:19.664
BUILDING THE ALIGNMENT THAT'S

02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:21.165
CONSISTENT WITH THE PROP ONE A

02:27:21.232 --> 02:27:22.633
REQUIREMENTS ON SPEED SO YEAH

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:24.368
THE SYSTEMS BEING BUILT FOR THAT

02:27:24.435 --> 02:27:26.270
SPEED AND THE TRAINS WILL BE

02:27:26.337 --> 02:27:27.371
ACQUIRED.

02:27:27.438 --> 02:27:28.706
AT TO TO MEET THOSE SOME

02:27:28.773 --> 02:27:30.074
SPECIFICATION WHERE THERE'S NO

02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:33.477
XIN COME THAT DID SLOW TRAINS

02:27:33.544 --> 02:27:35.379
ARE GOING TO PUT ON THIS TRACK.

02:27:35.446 --> 02:27:37.515
BUT AGAIN WHAT'S HOSTESS IS FAST

02:27:37.582 --> 02:27:39.550
TRAIN SO I'M NOT SURE WITH AS I

02:27:39.617 --> 02:27:40.618
MENTIONED WITH THE FEDERAL

02:27:40.685 --> 02:27:42.386
RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION OVER

02:27:42.453 --> 02:27:43.854
TIME YOU KNOW THEY'VE ASKED FOR

02:27:43.921 --> 02:27:45.423
DIFFERENT PLANS FOR EARLY USE OF

02:27:45.489 --> 02:27:47.191
THE SYSTEM BUT WE'VE TALKED

02:27:47.258 --> 02:27:47.959
ABOUT.

02:27:48.025 --> 02:27:49.460
WANTING TO DO ELECTRIFIED

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:52.129
SERVICE AND GO DIRECTLY TO THAT --

02:27:52.196 --> 02:27:53.464
NOT THE DIESEL TRAINS IN THE

02:27:53.531 --> 02:27:55.266
INTERIM SO THAT'S WHAT HAS BEEN

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:58.369
DISCUSSED WITH FRA IN RECENT --

02:27:58.436 --> 02:28:00.538
IN PRIOR YEARS DISCUSSION OF

02:28:00.605 --> 02:28:03.074
EARLY EARLY OPERATION OF THE

02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:07.645
SEGMENT SO LET ME READ ON PAGE.

02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:09.080
NINE SAYS AS PART OF THE FACE OF

02:28:09.146 --> 02:28:10.147
LIMITATION THE ASSETS BUILT IN

02:28:10.214 --> 02:28:10.815
THE CENTRAL VALLEY COULD BE USED

02:28:10.881 --> 02:28:11.816
BY AN INTERIM PASSENGER TRAIN

02:28:11.882 --> 02:28:13.017
OPERATOR.

02:28:13.084 --> 02:28:14.285
UNTIL ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECAME

02:28:14.352 --> 02:28:15.219
AVAILABLE.

02:28:15.286 --> 02:28:17.221
THIS APPROACH WAS MEMORIALIZED

02:28:17.288 --> 02:28:18.823
IN THE FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENTS

02:28:18.889 --> 02:28:20.725
SPECIFICALLY THE DIESEL SAN

02:28:20.791 --> 02:28:22.159
JOAQUIN INTERCITY PASSENGER

02:28:22.226 --> 02:28:24.061
TRAINS WHICH OPERATE ON SHARED

02:28:24.128 --> 02:28:25.763
FREIGHT RAIL TRACKS COULD BE

02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:27.298
SHIFTED TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:28:27.365 --> 02:28:28.933
TRACKS TO REALIZE.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.636
A REDUCE PASTOR TRAIN TRAVEL

02:28:31.702 --> 02:28:33.537
TIME IN CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:28:33.604 --> 02:28:34.572
I THINK THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH

02:28:34.639 --> 02:28:40.945
THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY CORRECT

02:28:41.012 --> 02:28:42.546
WELL THAT THAT -- DIESEL USE HAS

02:28:42.613 --> 02:28:43.981
BEEN DISCUSSED WITH THE FEDERAL

02:28:44.048 --> 02:28:45.416
GOVERNMENT IT IS AN INTERIM USE

02:28:45.483 --> 02:28:46.484
OPTION.

02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:48.119
BUT WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING

02:28:48.185 --> 02:28:50.021
PROPOSED IN INCLUDING TO THE

02:28:50.087 --> 02:28:51.522
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE

02:28:51.589 --> 02:28:53.124
ELECTRIFIED WITHIN A FOLLOW UP

02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:55.459
ON PAGE TEN WHICH IS HOWEVER THE

02:28:55.526 --> 02:28:56.060
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:56.994
INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NOT

02:28:57.061 --> 02:28:58.863
SUFFICIENT FUNDING. TO COMPLETE

02:28:58.929 --> 02:29:00.498
THE VALLEY TO VALLEY LIVE WITH

02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:01.132
THE CURRENT AVAILABLE COMMITTED

02:29:01.198 --> 02:29:02.933
FUNDING THEREFORE THE AUTHORITY

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.669
STATED ITS INTENT TO SEEK THE

02:29:04.735 --> 02:29:05.436
SUPPORT.

02:29:05.503 --> 02:29:06.337
OF THE T. L. UNVEILING THE

02:29:06.404 --> 02:29:08.406
POTENTIAL FOR AN INTERIM SERVICE

02:29:08.472 --> 02:29:09.674
IN THE CENTER VALLEY REVISED

02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:11.108
EARLY BENEFITS CORRECT IN AN

02:29:11.175 --> 02:29:13.210
INTERIM SERVICES THE ELECTRIFIED

02:29:13.277 --> 02:29:14.645
SERVICE OKAY.

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:16.814
SO THEN ON PAGE FIFTEEN YOU

02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:19.183
INDICATED A SIXTY TWO POINT SIX

02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:20.985
MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL IF

02:29:21.052 --> 02:29:23.087
EVEN IF WE RAN.

02:29:23.154 --> 02:29:24.989
THIS INTERIM SERVICE IN AN

02:29:25.056 --> 02:29:26.724
EXHIBIT ONE POINT TWO IT'S

02:29:26.791 --> 02:29:30.294
POTENTIALLY EIGHTY TWO POINT

02:29:30.361 --> 02:29:31.796
EIGHT IF YOU DON'T DO IT.

02:29:31.862 --> 02:29:33.264
RIGHT IF I'M THE FARE BOX

02:29:33.331 --> 02:29:34.598
REVENUE SURE AND WHAT THAT'S

02:29:34.665 --> 02:29:35.466
INDICATING AND THIS IS IN THE

02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:37.101
EACH YEAR ANALYSIS IS LOOKING AT

02:29:37.168 --> 02:29:38.769
THE COMBINED SERVICE AND THE

02:29:38.836 --> 02:29:40.638
CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH IS ACE AND

02:29:40.705 --> 02:29:42.907
SAN JOAQUIN AND THE INTERVIEWS

02:29:42.973 --> 02:29:44.342
HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT.

02:29:44.408 --> 02:29:45.810
AND INDICATING WITHOUT HIGH

02:29:45.876 --> 02:29:48.446
SPEED RAIL THERE'S A OPERATING

02:29:48.512 --> 02:29:51.148
SUPPORT OF ABOUT EIGHTY THREE

02:29:51.215 --> 02:29:52.249
MILLION DOLLARS.

02:29:52.316 --> 02:29:54.051
WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL BECAUSE OF

02:29:54.118 --> 02:29:55.786
THE INCREASE IN RIDERSHIP THE

02:29:55.853 --> 02:29:57.955
INCREASE IN FAREBOX RECOVERY.

02:29:58.022 --> 02:30:00.091
THAT OPERATING SUPPORT ACTUALLY

02:30:00.157 --> 02:30:05.062
FALLS BY TWENTY MILLION TO ABOUT

02:30:05.129 --> 02:30:05.696
SIXTY THREE ZERO SIXTY TWO POINT

02:30:05.763 --> 02:30:06.964
SIX MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL.

02:30:07.031 --> 02:30:07.498
WHY DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A

02:30:07.565 --> 02:30:10.134
SHORTFALL THE CURRENTLY -- ACE

02:30:10.201 --> 02:30:12.470
AND THE SAN JOAQUIN'S RECEIVE --

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:14.372
OPERATING SUPPORT AS DO THE

02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:15.940
COMMUTER RAIL AND OTHER

02:30:16.006 --> 02:30:17.975
INTERCITY RAIL -- PROVIDERS

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:19.343
RIGHT BUT IS IT DOESN'T COVER

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:21.512
THE COST.

02:30:21.579 --> 02:30:22.947
BUT IN LOOKING AT YOUR REPORT IT

02:30:23.013 --> 02:30:25.716
DOESN'T COVER THE COST COST IS

02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:26.350
TWENTY TWO TO TWO AND A TWENTY

02:30:26.417 --> 02:30:27.585
EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION AND THE

02:30:27.651 --> 02:30:29.954
REVENUES IS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY

02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:30.454
FIVE ONE EIGHT MILLION.

02:30:30.521 --> 02:30:31.856
THERE YOU HAVE AN ARROW SHOWING

02:30:31.922 --> 02:30:33.624
AT A SHORTFALL HOW DO YOU MAKE

02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:34.759
UP THAT SHORTFALL.

02:30:34.825 --> 02:30:37.428
WELL THAT THAT IS THE OPERATING

02:30:37.495 --> 02:30:39.864
SUPPORT AGAIN THAT FALLS WITH

02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:40.765
THE ADVENT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:30:40.831 --> 02:30:43.634
RELATIVE TO EXHIBIT ONE POINT

02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:45.903
TWO ON THE RIGHT SO DINNER I I

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:47.438
AGREE WITH ME I I'M WITH YOU.

02:30:47.505 --> 02:30:48.472
THE SHORTFALL DROPS FROM EIGHTY

02:30:48.539 --> 02:30:50.808
TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION TO SIXTY

02:30:50.875 --> 02:30:51.308
TWO POINT SIX MILLION.

02:30:51.375 --> 02:30:53.577
SO YOU SAID THAT SIXTY TWO POINT

02:30:53.644 --> 02:30:55.413
EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL.

02:30:55.479 --> 02:30:56.614
WHY I WANTED I DON'T BELIEVE

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:57.581
IT'S FAIR TO CALL THE SHORTFALL

02:30:57.648 --> 02:30:59.583
SO THESE ARE AS I MENTIONED WITH

02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:01.185
COMMUTER RAIL WITH INNER CITY

THE STATE.

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:19.270
MAKES UP A SHORTFALL.

02:31:19.336 --> 02:31:20.237
THAT'S CORRECT IGHT THE

02:31:20.304 --> 02:31:21.739
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COSTA REVENUE

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST

02:32:23.834 --> 02:32:27.271
IN THE REVENUES OF THE SYSTEM.

02:32:27.338 --> 02:32:28.339
BUT AGAIN IT'S AN EIGHT I THINK

02:32:28.405 --> 02:32:29.273
WE'RE I THINK WE'RE GENERALLY IN

02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:30.708
IN AGREEMENT ON ON THE STEPS

02:32:30.774 --> 02:32:32.943

HIGH SPEED RAIL PROVIDED SERVICE --

02:32:41.352 --> 02:32:42.987
THAT IS LOOKING AT A LONGER

02:32:43.053 --> 02:32:44.655
SEGMENT THAT WOULD GET VALLEY TO

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:46.657
VALLEY SAN JOSE TO BAKERSFIELD

02:32:46.724 --> 02:32:47.558
SAY THAT'S THE SEGMENT THAT

02:32:47.625 --> 02:32:48.626
WOULD.

02:32:48.692 --> 02:32:50.728
WHERE YOU'D HAVE THE RIDERSHIP --

02:32:50.794 --> 02:32:52.596
REVENUE FULLY FUNDING THE

02:32:52.663 --> 02:32:54.698
OPERATIONS AGAIN THESE INTERIM

02:32:54.765 --> 02:32:57.067
SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES BE A

02:32:57.134 --> 02:32:59.370
CALTRAIN ALBEIT CENTRAL VALLEY

02:32:59.436 --> 02:33:01.505
SERVICE -- THESE ARE SERVICES

02:33:01.572 --> 02:33:02.540
WHERE THERE ARE IS OPERATING

02:33:02.606 --> 02:33:04.608
SUPPORT CURRENTLY AND THAT WOULD

02:33:04.675 --> 02:33:06.243
CONTINUE WITH THE OPERATE WITH

02:33:06.310 --> 02:33:10.414
THE INTERIM SERVICES LET ME ASK

02:33:10.481 --> 02:33:11.415
THE QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY.

02:33:11.482 --> 02:33:12.116
DOES.

02:33:12.182 --> 02:33:12.750
THE CENTRAL VALLEY PORTION PAY

02:33:12.816 --> 02:33:16.253
FOR ITSELF.

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:17.354
IN TERMS OF OPERATIONS IN TERMS

02:33:17.421 --> 02:33:19.323
OF EVERYTHING.

02:33:19.390 --> 02:33:21.292
BUT THERE THERE WOULD BE ONGOING

02:33:21.358 --> 02:33:24.094
OPERATING SUPPORT -- FOR THE

02:33:24.161 --> 02:33:24.895
THREE SEGMENTS THAT ARE

02:33:24.962 --> 02:33:26.564
OPERATING THE SYSTEM TOGETHER

02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:28.465
AGAIN THE A FOR A FOUR BY WHO.

02:33:28.532 --> 02:33:29.733
AT THE STATE WOULD BE PART OF

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:31.101
THAT THE STATE WOULD PAY FOR IT

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:33.470
WE ARE TODAY SO THAT IS NOT.

02:33:33.537 --> 02:33:35.339
SO WHAT WAS IN THE BALLOT

02:33:35.406 --> 02:33:36.607
ARGUMENT IS THAT TRUE.

02:33:36.674 --> 02:33:38.208
THE USERS OF THE SYSTEM PAY FOR

02:33:38.275 --> 02:33:39.209
THE SYSTEM.

02:33:39.276 --> 02:33:39.977
YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW THAT THE

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:41.612
STATE'S GONNA OP THE OFFSET SOME

02:33:41.679 --> 02:33:42.980
OF THE COSTS.

02:33:43.047 --> 02:33:44.415
WELL AGAIN THIS IS THE

02:33:44.481 --> 02:33:45.849
DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHO'S

02:33:45.916 --> 02:33:47.418
PROVIDING THE SERVICE IT WOULD

02:33:47.484 --> 02:33:49.620
NOT BE DIRECTLY HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:33:49.687 --> 02:33:50.621
PROVIDING THE SERVICE IT WOULD

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:52.256
BE ONE OF THESE OTHER RAIL

02:33:52.323 --> 02:33:53.557
PROVIDERS.

02:33:53.624 --> 02:33:54.558
AGAIN IS DONE IN SOUTHERN

02:33:54.625 --> 02:33:56.760
CALIFORNIA IN LOS ANGELES WITH

02:33:56.827 --> 02:33:59.563
THE THE BOOK IN INVESTMENTS SO

02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:01.699
MY LAST QUESTION IS THIS -- AND

02:34:01.765 --> 02:34:02.666
I APPRECIATE THE GERMANS

02:34:02.733 --> 02:34:04.468
PATIENTS SO IN IN THIS OUR NEWS

02:34:04.535 --> 02:34:06.170
ARTICLE I THINK OFF THE NBC IS

02:34:06.236 --> 02:34:07.538

02:34:10.708 --> 02:34:11.308
PERSPECTIVE.

02:34:11.375 --> 02:34:12.943
LUTON SENSORS ON AN INDEPENDENT

02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:14.545
PEER REVIEW GROUP THAT OVERSEES

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:16.080
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT FOR

02:34:16.146 --> 02:34:17.982
THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE

02:34:18.048 --> 02:34:19.516
THOMPSON TOLD NBC BAY AREA HE

02:34:19.583 --> 02:34:21.251
BELIEVES THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS

02:34:21.318 --> 02:34:21.852
IN CRISIS.

02:34:21.919 --> 02:34:23.687
QUOTE THE TRUTH IS THAT THE PACE

02:34:23.754 --> 02:34:25.189
OF CONSTRUCTION REALLY WILL HAVE

02:34:25.255 --> 02:34:27.057
TO PICK UP RAPIDLY IF IN FACT

02:34:27.124 --> 02:34:28.292
IT'S GOING TO BE FINISHED BEFORE

02:34:28.359 --> 02:34:29.426
THE TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE

02:34:29.493 --> 02:34:32.429
THOMPSON SAID.

02:34:32.496 --> 02:34:33.964
CAN THIS BE DONE.

02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:34.531
WE WELL WE NEED TO ASK THE

02:34:34.598 --> 02:34:35.132
AUTHORITY AND WE NEED TO MAKE

02:34:35.199 --> 02:34:35.699
THEM.

02:34:35.766 --> 02:34:38.135
WE NEED TO MAKE THEM MAKE A STE

02:34:38.202 --> 02:34:39.303
FOUR SOLID ENFORCEABLE

02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:41.505
COMMITMENT ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN

02:34:41.572 --> 02:34:41.672
DO.

02:34:41.739 --> 02:34:42.973
THOMPSON BELIEVES THAT THE ONLY

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:44.375
WAY THE PROJECT CAN CONTINUE AS

02:34:44.441 --> 02:34:46.176
DESIGNED THIS FOR THE STATE TO

02:34:46.243 --> 02:34:48.679
RAISE TAXES AND DRASTICALLY

02:34:48.746 --> 02:34:50.414
INCREASE CONSTRUCTION.

02:34:50.481 --> 02:34:51.682
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT.

02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:53.684
STATEMENT.

02:34:53.751 --> 02:34:58.055
BUT THE I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO

02:34:58.122 --> 02:35:00.090
ACCELERATE OUR DELIVERY IN THE

02:35:00.157 --> 02:35:01.759
CENTRAL VALLEY SO I AGREE WITH

02:35:01.825 --> 02:35:03.127
THAT A 100%.

02:35:03.193 --> 02:35:04.294
SO THAT'S NOT A HARD GO IS THAT

02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:07.097
A MAYBE.

02:35:07.164 --> 02:35:08.198
GETTY HAVE AGREED WITH THE

02:35:08.265 --> 02:35:09.600
STABLE WE NEED TO ACCELERATE OUR

02:35:09.667 --> 02:35:11.902
OUR CONSTRUCTION SO THE SAME MSQ

02:35:11.969 --> 02:35:13.270
IN HIS THAT THOMPSON BELIEVES

02:35:13.337 --> 02:35:14.304
THE ONLY WAY THE PROJECT

02:35:14.371 --> 02:35:15.939
CONTINUOUS DESIGNED IS FOR THE

02:35:16.006 --> 02:35:17.875
STATE TO RAISE MORE TAXES AND

02:35:17.941 --> 02:35:18.308
DRASTICALLY INCREASE

02:35:18.375 --> 02:35:20.044
CONSTRUCTION.

02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:21.512
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'D

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:23.380
THAT THE ALREADY AND

02:35:23.447 --> 02:35:26.350
ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING.

02:35:26.417 --> 02:35:29.420
AGAIN NOT ON THE WE'RE LOOKING

02:35:29.486 --> 02:35:30.654
AT THE MONEY WE HAVE INTO

02:35:30.721 --> 02:35:31.755
DELIVERING.

02:35:31.822 --> 02:35:33.524
A HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT WITH

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:34.825
THE MONEY WE HAVE AN FOR C. TO

02:35:34.892 --> 02:35:36.126
HAVE IN THE FUTURE.

02:35:36.193 --> 02:35:37.795
WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT INCREASING

02:35:37.861 --> 02:35:39.530
TAXES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

02:35:39.596 --> 02:35:41.165
THE IDEA IS TO GET THE DELIVERY

02:35:41.231 --> 02:35:43.133
DONE GET THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:44.868
TRAINS UP AND OPERATING AND THEN

02:35:44.935 --> 02:35:48.038
YES I BELIEVE LOOK FOR THAT

02:35:48.105 --> 02:35:49.440
FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP TO RESUME.

02:35:49.506 --> 02:35:50.641
SURE THAT WOULD INCLUDE

02:35:50.708 --> 02:35:51.742
ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE FUTURE

02:35:51.809 --> 02:35:53.510
AS WELL.

02:35:53.577 --> 02:35:54.912
SO ALL THIS AND WITH THIS

02:35:54.978 --> 02:35:58.882
STATEMENT -- THIS THE LAST

02:35:58.949 --> 02:36:00.084
RECORD AS WE NEED TO HAVE THAT

02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:01.585
THE ALREADY MAKE A FULL SOLID

02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:03.487
ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENT AND I

02:36:03.554 --> 02:36:05.155
DON'T HEAR A FULL SOLID

02:36:05.222 --> 02:36:06.790
ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENT.

02:36:06.857 --> 02:36:07.991
THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THIS

02:36:08.058 --> 02:36:13.530
REPORT OUR OUR ARE DIFFICULT. TO

BE CUT TO TO ACCEPT IT BECAUSE

02:36:15.566 --> 02:36:16.900
THEY DON'T.

02:36:16.967 --> 02:36:18.936
YOU THE REPORT ISN'T IN REALITY

02:36:19.002 --> 02:36:20.938
RIGHT SO THE COSTS ARE GOING TO

02:36:21.004 --> 02:36:21.972
BE HIGHER.

02:36:22.039 --> 02:36:23.874
THE MARGINS ARE JEWS ARE YOU USE

02:36:23.941 --> 02:36:25.142
THAT YOU HAVE NO MARGIN.

02:36:25.209 --> 02:36:26.577
THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING GOES

02:36:26.643 --> 02:36:28.245
DOWN OVER TIME IF CAP AND TRADE

02:36:28.312 --> 02:36:29.179
IS GOING TO SUCCEED.

02:36:29.246 --> 02:36:30.714
IF IT AND AND THAT IS BEEN

02:36:30.781 --> 02:36:33.817
ACCEPTED BY BY BY EVERYONE EVEN

02:36:33.884 --> 02:36:35.185
WHO DOES YOU DESIGN CAP AND

02:36:35.252 --> 02:36:35.686

GOVERNMENT HAS ENGAGED -- SICK

02:36:42.025 --> 02:36:43.660
REVIEWS ARE GOING FORWARD

02:36:43.727 --> 02:36:44.962

IN TWENTY AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

02:36:49.099 --> 02:36:51.769
AND WHAT THE DESIGN OF THIS

02:36:51.835 --> 02:36:52.970
PROJECT IS NOW IS NOT THE SAME.

02:36:53.036 --> 02:36:54.037
IT IS NOT THE SAME NO ONE CAN

FROM BAY THE BAY AREA TO ANAHEIM

02:37:00.511 --> 02:37:02.412
THAT THIS REPORT DOES NOT

BUT THIS IS A LAUNCH TO DON'T

PROJECT.

02:41:18.735 --> 02:41:21.738
OF OF MASSIVE SCALE.

02:41:21.805 --> 02:41:24.074
NOT AND I ANTICIPATE AT SOME

02:41:24.141 --> 02:41:25.008
POINT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE

02:41:25.075 --> 02:41:26.877
A FULL PARTNER IN THIS AND WE

02:41:26.943 --> 02:41:28.478
NEED THAT WE DO.

02:41:28.545 --> 02:41:31.948
BUT LOOKING AT THE TWENTY

02:41:32.015 --> 02:41:33.183
NINETEEN SORT OF A CONFIGURATION

02:41:33.250 --> 02:41:34.484
AND UP AND UP EXTRAPOLATING THAT

OUT -- IN WELL INTO THE FUTURE I

02:41:38.388 --> 02:41:39.856
THINK IS IS UP.

02:41:39.923 --> 02:41:41.224
A LITTLE BIT OF FOLLY BUT I

02:41:41.291 --> 02:41:42.659
SHARE THE ANXIETY ABOUT THE

02:41:42.726 --> 02:41:43.527
CURRENT.

02:41:43.593 --> 02:41:46.596
RELATIONSHIP -- BUT I THANK YOU

02:41:48.565 --> 02:41:51.134
VERY DIFFICULT TOPIC AS CHAIR.

02:41:51.201 --> 02:41:52.135
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR AND I THINK

02:41:52.202 --> 02:41:54.371
WE'LL TAKE UP PUBLIC COMMENT ON

02:41:54.438 --> 02:41:56.706

WE MOVE ON ISSUE -- FOR SINCE

02:41:59.643 --> 02:42:01.845
WE'VE ALREADY SPENT SO MUCH TIME

02:42:01.912 --> 02:42:03.080
ON THIS ITEM WE SHOULD ISOLATE

02:42:03.146 --> 02:42:05.449
THE PUBLIC COMMENT TOO I THINK.

02:42:05.515 --> 02:42:11.354
BUT I WANT TO BE -- A CLEAR IN

02:42:11.421 --> 02:42:13.423
UNDERSTANDING -- THE ROLE OF THE

02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:14.791
FEDERAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:42:14.858 --> 02:42:17.194
CURRENTLY IS IT CORRECT THAT

02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:20.564
WE'RE BEING ASKED -- TO A

02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:22.199
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROJECT CAN

02:42:22.265 --> 02:42:24.801
MOVE FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY BY

02:42:24.868 --> 02:42:26.770
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:42:26.837 --> 02:42:28.038
CORRECT YEAH THEIR DATES IN A

02:42:28.105 --> 02:42:29.706
LETTER OF COURSE -- INDICATING

02:42:29.773 --> 02:42:32.876
CONCERN ON ON THE SCHEDULE --

02:42:32.943 --> 02:42:34.377
HIGH SPEED RAIL RESPONDED NO

02:42:34.444 --> 02:42:35.912
INDICATING WERE COMPLYING WITH

02:42:35.979 --> 02:42:37.380
THE GRANT AGREEMENT AND STILL

02:42:37.447 --> 02:42:39.749
ABLE TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY

02:42:39.816 --> 02:42:41.384
TWO DEADLINES FOR THE SCHEDULE --

02:42:41.451 --> 02:42:43.587
SO AGAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:42:43.653 --> 02:42:45.322
IS A IS A PARTNER IN ACHIEVING

02:42:45.388 --> 02:42:47.157
SOME OF THOSE DELIVERABLES SUCH

02:42:47.224 --> 02:42:50.427
AS THE FEDERAL NEPA -- HAVE

02:42:50.494 --> 02:42:51.595
REVIEW AND APPROVAL.

02:42:51.661 --> 02:42:53.029
AND YET IT'S ALSO MY

02:42:53.096 --> 02:42:53.997
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE FEDERAL

02:42:54.064 --> 02:42:56.900
GOVERNMENT NOW IS -- ESSENTIALLY

02:42:56.967 --> 02:42:59.836
REFUSING TO ENGAGE -- ON MOVING

02:42:59.903 --> 02:43:01.571
THE PROJECT FORWARD.

02:43:01.638 --> 02:43:02.305
WOULD THAT BE AN ACCURATE

02:43:02.372 --> 02:43:04.875
STATEMENT THAT'S CORRECT YEAH

02:43:04.941 --> 02:43:06.510
THEY HAVEN'T SAID.

02:43:06.576 --> 02:43:08.278
THAT THEN PENCILS DOWN ON THAT

02:43:08.345 --> 02:43:10.447
THE NEED FOR WORK I BELIEVE

02:43:10.514 --> 02:43:12.182
SINCE LAST AUGUST.

02:43:12.249 --> 02:43:13.984
AND AS SINCE THE LETTERS CAME

02:43:14.050 --> 02:43:16.486
OUT THEY THEY HAVEN'T -- HAVEN'T

02:43:16.553 --> 02:43:19.222
MET WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:43:19.289 --> 02:43:20.891
WELL I THINK THAT SPEAKS FOR

02:43:20.957 --> 02:43:22.259
ITSELF.

02:43:22.325 --> 02:43:23.360

02:43:43.013 --> 02:43:44.214
ABOUT THESE.

02:43:44.281 --> 02:43:45.982
COST INCREASES THAT YOU'VE ALL

02:43:46.049 --> 02:43:47.784

IN ADDITION TO THE NBC --

02:43:51.621 --> 02:43:53.990

AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT ONE

02:44:00.697 --> 02:44:02.632
OF THE LARGEST REASONS FOR THESE

02:44:02.699 --> 02:44:03.900
COST INCREASES.

02:44:03.967 --> 02:44:06.102
IS BECAUSE OF THE OVER RELIANCE

02:44:06.169 --> 02:44:08.038
FOR ALMOST COMPLETE RELIANCE ON

02:44:08.104 --> 02:44:09.372
PRIVATE SECTOR ENGINEERING

02:44:09.439 --> 02:44:11.841
CONSULTANTS TO RUN THE PROJECT.

02:44:11.908 --> 02:44:13.109
THEY HAVE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:44:13.176 --> 02:44:15.111
CONSULTANTS HIRING PRIVATE

02:44:15.178 --> 02:44:18.281
SECTOR CONSULTANTS TO OVERSEE

02:44:18.348 --> 02:44:19.316
PRIVATE SECTOR CONSULTANTS.

02:44:19.382 --> 02:44:20.884
HAVE BEING INSPECTED BY PRIVATE

02:44:20.951 --> 02:44:23.253
SECTOR CONSULTANTS ALL AT A COST

02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:24.754
OF TWO OR THREE TIMES THE COST

02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:25.488
OF WHAT.

02:44:25.555 --> 02:44:26.523
THE STATE EMPLOYED ENGINEER

02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:27.724
WOULD BE.

02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:28.692
WE THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE

02:44:28.758 --> 02:44:31.595
SHOULD FIND A WAY OF HAVING THE

02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:33.563
AGENCY STAFF UP OVER THE LONGER

02:44:33.630 --> 02:44:35.632
TERM SO THAT YOU CAN REDUCE YOUR

02:44:35.699 --> 02:44:37.067
COSTS AND GAIN CONTROL OF THE

02:44:37.133 --> 02:44:38.235
PROJECT.

02:44:38.301 --> 02:44:39.936
AND REDUCE THESE COSTS IN GOING

02:44:40.003 --> 02:44:41.471
FORWARD WE DON'T THINK YOU

02:44:41.538 --> 02:44:42.872
SHOULD WAIT FOR FUTURE BUDGET

02:44:42.939 --> 02:44:45.542
YEAR -- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:44:45.609 --> 02:44:46.109

02:44:49.879 --> 02:44:53.049
ENGINEERS TO SAVE COSTS ON THE

02:44:53.116 --> 02:44:53.283
PROJECT.

02:45:15.905 --> 02:45:17.173
STARTING WITH THE ALIGNMENT

02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:19.709
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY.

02:45:19.776 --> 02:45:21.311
THAT THE NON ALIGNMENT BETWEEN

02:45:21.378 --> 02:45:23.280
MISS SET AND BAKERSFIELD WILL

02:45:23.346 --> 02:45:26.016

BETWEEN ZERO AND FRESNO.

02:45:44.901 --> 02:45:47.137
THAT REQUIRES LITTLE TO NO

02:45:47.203 --> 02:45:49.539
COMMENT.

02:45:49.606 --> 02:45:51.841

AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST.

02:46:15.398 --> 02:46:17.334

WITH AN UPDATE HERE TODAY IT IS

02:46:39.489 --> 02:46:40.857
JUST AN UPDATE IT'S ONE STOP

02:46:40.924 --> 02:46:44.894
ALONG THE WAY -- THE THIS -- AT

02:46:44.961 --> 02:46:46.296
IN MY VIEW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:49.366
PROJECT THAT REMAINS -- NOT JUST --

02:46:49.432 --> 02:46:51.334
ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST

02:46:51.401 --> 02:46:52.402
IMPORTANT -- INFRASTRUCTURE

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:53.970
PROJECTS BUT ONE OF THE

02:46:54.037 --> 02:46:56.039
COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT

02:46:56.106 --> 02:46:57.907
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WE ARE --

02:46:57.974 --> 02:46:59.943
ONE OF THE FEW INDUSTRIALIZED

02:47:00.009 --> 02:47:01.911
NATIONS IN THE WORLD -- THAT

02:47:01.978 --> 02:47:04.447
TODAY NOT -- DO NOT HAVE HIGH

02:47:04.514 --> 02:47:06.249
SPEED RAIL NOW IS THAT IN AND OF

02:47:06.316 --> 02:47:09.319
ITSELF A REASON WHY WE HAVE TO

02:47:09.386 --> 02:47:11.287
HAVE IT HERE NO -- BUT THERE ARE

02:47:11.354 --> 02:47:13.022
COMPELLING REASONS WHY HIGH

02:47:13.089 --> 02:47:14.991
SPEED RAIL IS IMPORTANT TO

02:47:15.058 --> 02:47:16.860
CALIFORNIA TO THE COUNTRY OF

02:47:16.926 --> 02:47:18.194
THOSE OF ALL BEEN DISCUSSED IN

02:47:18.261 --> 02:47:20.196
THE PAST THE VOTERS ACTUALLY

02:47:20.263 --> 02:47:21.998
WEIGHED IN ON THIS ALTHOUGH.

02:47:22.065 --> 02:47:23.967
I YOU KNOW IT WAS SOMETIME AGO

02:47:24.033 --> 02:47:27.704
BUT THEY PROVIDED THE SEED MONEY

02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:28.905
FOR THE PROJECT -- OPPOSITION TO

02:47:28.972 --> 02:47:33.042
THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN -- AGAIN

02:47:33.109 --> 02:47:34.878
OF THIS BIG PROJECT IT GENERATES

02:47:34.944 --> 02:47:37.947
OPPOSITION I GUESS I GET THAT --

02:47:38.014 --> 02:47:43.853
BUT WHETHER -- THE SAME FOLKS

02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:45.255
WERE IN OPPOSITION WHO WERE IN

02:47:45.321 --> 02:47:48.825
OPPOSITION TODAY AND NOW THAT --

02:47:48.892 --> 02:47:51.161
I THINK A MORE REALISTIC

02:47:51.227 --> 02:47:53.129
PROPOSALS BEING MADE -- IN

02:47:53.196 --> 02:47:55.064
RESPONSE TO THOSE WHO SAT AND

02:47:55.131 --> 02:47:57.534
COMPLAINED -- THERE'S NO MONEY

02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:58.935
TO BUILD OUT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

02:47:59.002 --> 02:48:00.637
WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE

02:48:00.703 --> 02:48:03.773
ACTUALLY CAN DO AND NOW WE HAVE

02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:05.508
AN UPDATE THAT TRIES TO DO

02:48:05.575 --> 02:48:06.876
EXACTLY THAT.

02:48:06.943 --> 02:48:10.313
AND THE SAME CRITICS ARE OF ALL

02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:12.482
OVER THE PROJECT SAYING WELL YOU

02:48:12.549 --> 02:48:15.084
KNOW THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS -- AND

02:48:15.151 --> 02:48:15.919
YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING THE

02:48:15.985 --> 02:48:17.220
INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED

02:48:17.287 --> 02:48:18.455
TO BE PROVIDING AND ALL THE

02:48:18.521 --> 02:48:19.823
OTHER ARGUMENTS THAT WE HEAR AND

02:48:19.889 --> 02:48:21.591
I YOU KNOW I RESPECT THE FACT

02:48:21.658 --> 02:48:22.258
THAT THERE.

02:48:22.325 --> 02:48:24.360
ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROJECT

02:48:24.427 --> 02:48:26.796
PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S SO BIG AND

02:48:26.863 --> 02:48:29.866
PARTLY BECAUSE I'VE IT TAKES.

02:48:29.933 --> 02:48:33.636
UGH UGH A LONG TIME UNDER.

02:48:33.703 --> 02:48:35.605
ANY SCENARIO TO BUILD OUT A

02:48:35.672 --> 02:48:37.907
PROJECT TO OF THIS LENGTH AND

02:48:37.974 --> 02:48:40.410
THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF IN

02:48:40.477 --> 02:48:43.279
SPEND CERTAINTIES -- WHICH COME

02:48:43.346 --> 02:48:45.448
ALONG WITH ANY PUBLIC WORKS

02:48:45.515 --> 02:48:48.518
PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE.

02:48:48.585 --> 02:48:50.487
OF WE NEED TO WORK THROUGHOUT

02:48:50.553 --> 02:48:52.455
THE THROUGH THOSE ISSUES STEP BY

02:48:52.522 --> 02:48:54.057
STEP AND STAGE BY STAGE AND I

02:48:54.123 --> 02:48:55.525
THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR.

02:48:55.592 --> 02:48:58.194
IS TRYING TO DO THAT NOW AND

02:48:58.261 --> 02:49:01.264
TAKE A MORE REALISTIC OF OF YOU

02:49:01.331 --> 02:49:02.565
OF WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE NEAR

02:49:02.632 --> 02:49:04.834
TERM UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE

02:49:04.901 --> 02:49:06.569
ARE ADDITIONAL STEPS.

02:49:06.636 --> 02:49:08.238
AND THAT THE FULL BUILD OUT OF

02:49:08.304 --> 02:49:11.374
THIS PROJECT IS ESSENTIAL -- AND

02:49:11.441 --> 02:49:15.111
AND NEEDS TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH

02:49:15.178 --> 02:49:19.148
WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THE IN

02:49:19.215 --> 02:49:22.151
THE UPDATE -- I DON'T I DON'T

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:23.453
THINK A AND THIS IS STILL TRUE

02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:24.621
AND IN EVERY DISTRICT IN THE

02:49:24.687 --> 02:49:26.523
STATE I THINK THIS IS A PROJECT

02:49:26.589 --> 02:49:27.457
THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT KIND OF

02:49:27.524 --> 02:49:29.192
SCRATCH THEIR HEADS AND THINK.

02:49:29.259 --> 02:49:30.727
IS IT REALISTIC IS IT NOT COULD

02:49:30.793 --> 02:49:32.262
THIS MONEY BE BETTER SPENT IN

02:49:32.328 --> 02:49:34.497
OTHER WAYS THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:49:34.564 --> 02:49:37.066
LEGITIMATE CONVERSATIONS AROUND

02:49:37.133 --> 02:49:37.267
THIS.

02:49:37.333 --> 02:49:40.370
BUT THE PROJECT ITSELF THE NEED

02:49:40.436 --> 02:49:43.006
FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL AS A

02:49:43.072 --> 02:49:44.908

OF OUR AIRPORTS ARE NEAR MAXED

02:50:07.363 --> 02:50:09.198

AS HERBA.

02:54:22.518 --> 02:54:23.820
AND IT IS IN A STRUCTURAL

02:54:23.886 --> 02:54:25.555
DEFICIT.

02:54:25.621 --> 02:54:26.856
HAS BEEN FOR A FEW YEARS.

02:54:26.923 --> 02:54:28.724
OVER THE LAST DECADE THE DEMAND

02:54:28.791 --> 02:54:29.992
FOR OUR SERVICES AT THE ENERGY

02:54:30.059 --> 02:54:31.060
COMMISSION HAVE BEEN INCREASING

02:54:31.127 --> 02:54:33.629
WE HAVE GOTTEN -- ABOUT SEVENTY

02:54:33.696 --> 02:54:35.431
NEW PEOPLE -- AT THE ENERGY

02:54:35.498 --> 02:54:38.134
COMMISSION BY OF THE LEGISLATURE.

02:54:38.201 --> 02:54:40.036
AT THE SAME TIME A REVENUES HAVE

02:54:40.102 --> 02:54:41.838
BEEN DECLINING.

02:54:41.904 --> 02:54:43.906
WHY IS THAT THERE'S TWO MAIN

02:54:43.973 --> 02:54:46.275
FACTORS THE FIRST IS BUYING THE

02:54:46.342 --> 02:54:47.543
METER SOLAR WE'VE BEEN?

02:54:47.610 --> 02:54:48.678
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN

02:54:48.744 --> 02:54:50.112
CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST DECADE

02:54:50.179 --> 02:54:52.148
OR SO IN INCREASING THE AMOUNT

02:54:52.215 --> 02:54:53.482
OF ROOFTOP SOLAR.

02:54:53.549 --> 02:54:54.884
FACT WE HAVE EIGHT GIGAWATTS

02:54:54.951 --> 02:54:56.552
TODAY GIVE OR TAKE WHICH IS

02:54:56.619 --> 02:54:58.287
ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER THE STATE

02:54:58.354 --> 02:54:59.755
OF VERMONT.

02:54:59.822 --> 02:55:01.290
SO WE DON'T REALLY WELL THERE

02:55:01.357 --> 02:55:03.226
SECONDLY WE'VE DONE VERY WELL IN

02:55:03.292 --> 02:55:05.761
TERMS OF CONSERVATION WE ARE A

02:55:05.828 --> 02:55:08.931
PER CAPITA ELECTRICITY USAGE 44%

02:55:08.998 --> 02:55:10.867
BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

02:55:10.933 --> 02:55:12.602
AND THAT'S DUE TO A WHOLE HOST

02:55:12.668 --> 02:55:15.037
OF FACTORS BUT AMONG THEM ARE

02:55:15.104 --> 02:55:17.206
THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S A PLANTS

02:55:17.273 --> 02:55:19.442
AND BUILDING REGULATIONS THAT

02:55:19.508 --> 02:55:21.711
DRIVE DOWN ELECTRICITY

02:55:21.777 --> 02:55:22.812
CONSUMPTION.

02:55:22.879 --> 02:55:23.813
THESE TWO FACTORS TOGETHER --

02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:25.581
HAVE CONSPIRED TO REDUCE OUR

02:55:25.648 --> 02:55:27.450
REVENUES THEY'VE BEEN GREAT FOR

02:55:27.516 --> 02:55:29.185
CALIFORNIANS IN TERMS OF

02:55:29.252 --> 02:55:31.187
REDUCING ENERGY BILLS THEY HAVE

02:55:31.254 --> 02:55:32.722
BEEN GREAT FOR HELPING US

02:55:32.788 --> 02:55:34.156
ACHIEVE OUR AIR QUALITY IN OUR

02:55:34.223 --> 02:55:35.458
CLIMATE GOALS BUT THE ENERGY

02:55:35.524 --> 02:55:36.993
COMMISSION HAS SUFFERED BECAUSE

02:55:37.059 --> 02:55:39.228
THEY HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:40.496
BUDGET.

02:55:40.563 --> 02:55:42.465
AND THIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN

02:55:42.531 --> 02:55:43.566
CONTRIBUTED OR STRUCTURAL

02:55:43.633 --> 02:55:44.901
DEFICIT WHAT IS KEPT US AFLOAT

02:55:44.967 --> 02:55:46.335
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS THE

02:55:46.402 --> 02:55:47.370
FACT THAT WE HAVE BUILT A

02:55:47.436 --> 02:55:48.504
RESERVE.

02:55:48.571 --> 02:55:49.972
AND WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING DOWN

02:55:50.039 --> 02:55:51.674
THAT RESERVE OVER THE LAST FEW

02:55:51.741 --> 02:55:54.477
YEARS -- LAST OVER THE LAST TWO

02:55:54.543 --> 02:55:56.112
BUDGET CYCLES WE HAVE REDUCED

02:55:56.178 --> 02:55:57.780
PRESSURE ON THIS -- BUT ACCOUNT

02:55:57.847 --> 02:55:59.215
BY TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

02:55:59.282 --> 02:56:01.017
BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH TO

02:56:01.083 --> 02:56:03.219
CLOSE THE DEFICIT ENTIRELY SO

02:56:03.286 --> 02:56:05.121
WERE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH

02:56:05.187 --> 02:56:06.589
A SUITE OF MEASURES THAT WILL

REDUCE THE DEFICIT FURTHER.

02:56:09.425 --> 02:56:12.461
BY ANOTHER -- APPROXIMATELY TEN

02:56:12.528 --> 02:56:14.664
MILLION DOLLARS -- IN THAT IS

02:56:14.730 --> 02:56:17.033
WHAT WE ASK TODAY THANK YOU VERY

ANALYST'S OFFICE OUT WE WE DO

02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:29.779
THINK THE PROPOSED PROPOSAL IS A

02:56:29.845 --> 02:56:31.180
SIGNIFICANT STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:56:32.982 --> 02:56:34.116

THE ANNUAL DEFICIT ARPA.

02:56:36.419 --> 02:56:37.286
AND SO WE DID DO RECOMMENDED THE

02:56:41.757 --> 02:56:43.025
NOTE THAT THE PROPOSED CHANGES

02:56:43.092 --> 02:56:45.461
ONLY PARTIALLY ADDRESS THE

02:56:45.528 --> 02:56:46.862
ANNUAL DEFICIT.

02:56:46.929 --> 02:56:48.064
EVEN IF THOSE CHANGES ARE

02:56:48.130 --> 02:56:49.865
ADOPTED THEY'RE STILL -- THE

02:56:49.932 --> 02:56:51.901
ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS ROUGHLY

ANNUAL DEFICIT -- GOING FORWARD

02:56:54.503 --> 02:56:56.005
AND SO -- UNDER THOSE

02:56:56.072 --> 02:56:57.173

ISSUED EARLIER THIS YEAR FOR

02:57:15.491 --> 02:57:17.059
ADDITIONAL ACTIONS THAT COULD BE

02:57:17.126 --> 02:57:18.761

BEHIND THE METER ELECTRICITY

02:57:23.566 --> 02:57:24.867
THAT'S ONE OF THE THE MAIN --

02:57:24.934 --> 02:57:26.268
CAUSES OF OF THE STRUCTURAL

02:57:26.335 --> 02:57:27.269

ELECTRICITY -- DIRECTING THE PC

02:57:33.976 --> 02:57:34.944
TO REMOVE THERE'S CURRENTLY A

03:11:24.739 --> 03:11:26.341
WHOSE LUNGS ARE STILL DEVELOPING.

03:11:26.408 --> 03:11:27.843
NATIONALLY IT'S ESTIMATED --

03:11:27.909 --> 03:11:29.477
THAT THEY'RE OVER FIVE POINT

03:11:29.544 --> 03:11:31.446
THREE TONS MILLION TONS OF

03:11:31.513 --> 03:11:32.280
GREENHOUSE GASES EMITTED EVERY

03:11:32.347 --> 03:11:35.250
YEAR BY THESE DIRTY SCHOOL BUSES.

03:11:35.317 --> 03:11:36.251
WE ALL KNOW THAT CLEAN

03:11:36.318 --> 03:11:37.953
ELECTRICAL BUSES WILL NOT ONLY

03:11:38.019 --> 03:11:38.653
PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH THE HEALTH

03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:39.654
YOUR COMMUTE.

03:11:39.721 --> 03:11:41.156
THEY WILL ALSO OFFER VALUABLE

03:11:41.223 --> 03:11:42.858
SAVINGS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS --

03:11:42.924 --> 03:11:44.426
BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY THESE

03:11:44.492 --> 03:11:46.027
BUSES ARE A MUCH MORE VIABLE

03:11:46.094 --> 03:11:47.796
COST EFFECTIVE OPTION AND IN

03:11:47.863 --> 03:11:49.331
FACT THE OVER THE LIFETIME OF AN

03:11:49.397 --> 03:11:50.565
AVERAGE SCHOOL BUS.

03:11:50.632 --> 03:11:51.800
EACH OF THESE BUSES COULD SAVE

03:11:51.867 --> 03:11:53.235
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THOUSANDS OF

03:11:53.301 --> 03:11:54.736
DOLLARS A YEAR IN REDUCED FUEL

03:11:54.803 --> 03:11:56.438
AND MAINTENANCE COSTS COMPARED

03:11:56.504 --> 03:11:57.839
TO THEIR DIESEL COUNTERPARTS THE

03:11:57.906 --> 03:11:58.907
CHALLENGES.

03:11:58.974 --> 03:12:00.175
THE UP FRONT COST FOR THESE

03:12:00.242 --> 03:12:02.611
BUSES ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN

03:12:02.677 --> 03:12:04.746
THEIR COUNTERPARTS -- ALLEGED

03:12:04.813 --> 03:12:05.914
BUSES CAN ALSO PROVIDE ELECTRIC

03:12:05.981 --> 03:12:07.549
GRID AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS FOR

03:12:07.616 --> 03:12:09.384
SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY DISCHARGING

03:12:09.451 --> 03:12:10.819
ENERGY AT CRITICAL MOMENTS.

03:12:10.886 --> 03:12:12.821
I AND I'LL JUST MENTION AS A

03:12:12.888 --> 03:12:13.955

MOVING TOWARD AN ALL ELECTRIC

03:12:17.659 --> 03:12:18.526
BUS FLEET.

03:12:18.593 --> 03:12:20.028
EVERY MILE DRIVEN BY AN ELECTRIC

03:12:20.095 --> 03:12:21.730
SCHOOL BUS COST LESS THAN TWENTY

03:12:21.796 --> 03:12:22.931
CENTS PER MILE WHERE IS A

03:12:22.998 --> 03:12:24.332
STANDARD DIESEL MODEL COSTS

03:12:24.399 --> 03:12:26.801
AROUND EIGHTY CENTS PER MILE.

03:12:26.868 --> 03:12:28.069
SO WITH THAT -- WE'VE A BUDGET

03:12:28.136 --> 03:12:30.305

TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ARE

03:13:32.067 --> 03:13:33.902
STILL ON THE RISE AND MANY

03:13:33.969 --> 03:13:35.470
COMMUNITIES STILL SUFFER FROM

ONLY THING THEY CAN REPLENISH

03:17:34.776 --> 03:17:36.878
THE GROUNDWATER SO OBVIOUSLY --

03:17:36.945 --> 03:17:38.780
PIPING ALL OF THIS WATER OFF OF

03:17:38.846 --> 03:17:40.448
THE MOUNTAIN IS NOT

03:17:40.515 --> 03:17:43.284
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE --

03:17:43.351 --> 03:17:45.153
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REQUEST

03:17:45.220 --> 03:17:45.753
FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR

TERTIARY WASTE WATER TREATMENT

03:17:47.422 --> 03:17:48.456
PLANT THAT WOULD TREAT THAT

03:17:48.523 --> 03:17:50.425
WATER UP TO A LEVEL SUFFICIENT

03:17:50.491 --> 03:17:51.593
TO BE ABLE TO BE PUT INTO THE

03:17:51.659 --> 03:17:52.927
LAKE AND EVENTUALLY PERCOLATED

03:17:52.994 --> 03:17:54.195
BACK INTO THE GROUND WATER.

03:17:54.262 --> 03:17:55.697
THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DESIGNED

THROUGH THE STANFIELD MARCH

03:18:03.271 --> 03:18:05.573
WHICH IS A SANCTUARY FOR

03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:07.475
MIGRATORY WATERFALL AND ALSO

03:18:07.542 --> 03:18:08.676
THROUGH PERCOLATION PONDS THAT

03:18:08.743 --> 03:18:11.779
BENEFIT A NUMBER OF OTHER --

03:18:11.846 --> 03:18:14.148

THEY'RE BATTLING THIS BLAZE IT'S

03:26:29.410 --> 03:26:30.644
NOT UNCOMMON FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO

03:26:30.711 --> 03:26:33.380
STAY ON THE FIRE LINE FOR DAYS.

03:26:33.447 --> 03:26:34.448

THIS FORCE THE STATE TO BORROW

03:27:25.633 --> 03:27:27.334
FROM PRIVATE ENGINES IT'S A MUCH

03:27:27.401 --> 03:27:28.369
HIGHER COST.

03:27:28.435 --> 03:27:29.870
BUT IT ALSO INCREASES THE NUMBER

03:27:29.937 --> 03:27:31.205
OF CIVILIANS FIREFIGHTERS HOMES

03:27:31.272 --> 03:27:33.274

03:28:37.504 --> 03:28:38.772
IT IS PROVEN THAT USING THESE

03:28:38.839 --> 03:28:40.875
BIOMASS FACILITIES REDUCES THE

03:28:40.941 --> 03:28:42.977
