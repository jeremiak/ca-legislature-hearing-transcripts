MAKE IT EASIER TO BILL EIGHTY

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.377
USE. HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THE

00:24:39.444 --> 00:24:41.713
LEGISLATURE IN OUR STATEWIDE.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.549

AND REASON IT'S NECESSARY IS

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.375
BECAUSE THERE ARE HOMEOWNERS

00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:12.677
ESPECIALLY UNFORTUNATELY LOW

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:14.813

GREAT EQUITY BUT THEY MAY NOT

BUT BECAUSE THE IMPROVEMENT IS

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.228
THE IMPROVEMENT TO THE HOME

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:32.764
IMPROVEMENT IS WILL HAVE LITTLE

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:35.901

01:59:29.228 --> 01:59:31.297
LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED MOSTLY

01:59:31.364 --> 01:59:33.633

WHAT A CRISIS WE HAVE AND THAT

01:59:38.371 --> 01:59:38.838

01:59:45.778 --> 01:59:48.614
WORRY BECAUSE THIS MAY HAVE

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:50.349
WORKED IN SAN DIEGO BUT SAN

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:51.684

BUST TRANSFER. PUBLIC COUNTY.

01:59:56.622 --> 02:00:00.226
SYSTEM AND THAT REALLY IS

02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:02.395
BENEFICIAL WHEN YOU'RE STARTING

02:00:02.461 --> 02:00:04.430
THE INCREASED DENSITIES AND- I

02:00:04.497 --> 02:00:07.066

02:00:07.133 --> 02:00:08.701
DOES. ABOUT IT SO I GET

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:10.269
CONCERNED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

02:00:10.336 --> 02:00:11.571
PUSHING FOR US TO TAKE OUR

02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:13.406

THE SUBURBS. BRINKLEY THAT

02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:22.081
REALLY HASN'T TO FRUITION AND

02:00:22.148 --> 02:00:25.217
SO- IF I COULD CALL YOUR

02:00:25.284 --> 02:00:27.286
ATTENTION TO PAGE FIVE. OF THE

02:00:27.353 --> 02:00:30.156

THERE'S FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL

02:00:43.402 --> 02:00:45.571
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALWAYS GOOD

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:47.139
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN START

02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:49.842
TO DECIDE WHAT SOME OF THE SOME

02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:53.512
OF THE INCENTIVES ARE AND- THE

02:00:53.579 --> 02:00:54.614

02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:13.499
GOVERNMENT CAN REQUIRE OF A

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:15.267
100% AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS. I

02:01:15.334 --> 02:01:16.636
CHECKED FOR LOWER INCOME

02:01:16.702 --> 02:01:21.974

SPACES PER UNIT TO ZERO SPACES

02:01:24.477 --> 02:01:26.679
PER UNIT AND WHAT IMMEDIATELY

02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:28.848
JUMPS INTO MY MIND IS FOR ALL

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:31.417
THE UNITS WHICH MEANS THERE

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:33.285
WOULD BE NO PARKING REQUIREMENT

02:01:33.352 --> 02:01:35.454
AS I READ THAT SENTENCE THE

02:01:35.521 --> 02:01:38.057
PARKING REQUIREMENT FOR PROJECT.

02:01:38.124 --> 02:01:40.459
AND DISTINGUISH. A TWENTY UNIT

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:43.629
PROJECT. AND A TWO HUNDRED UNIT

02:01:43.696 --> 02:01:46.032
PROJECT AND SO I GET CONCERNED

02:01:46.098 --> 02:01:52.471
ABOUT. USING AND URBAN. MODEL

02:01:52.538 --> 02:01:54.206
AND SAYING THIS IS HOW WE

02:01:54.273 --> 02:01:55.941
SHOULD INTERPRET DENSITY

02:01:56.008 --> 02:01:58.878
BONUSES ALL OVER THE STATE SO I

02:01:58.944 --> 02:02:03.716
HATE TO PUT YOU IN A POSITION

02:02:03.783 --> 02:02:05.618
OF TRYING TO DEFEND THAT WHAT

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.153
AND THEN BUT THAT'S KIND OF

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:08.688
WHERE I'M COMING. I REALLY LIKE

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:09.221
ON SEPT IN THE AND THEN I

02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:10.990
STARTED AT THE DETAIL AND I'M

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:11.924
I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT IF IT

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:14.193
DOESN'T WORK WELL IN THE

02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:15.661
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RICH I

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:19.298
REPRESENTS- IF YOU CAN ANSWER

02:02:19.365 --> 02:02:21.567
THAT AND- THAT WOULD BE FINE.

02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:23.869

QUESTION- I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:02:32.178 --> 02:02:33.646
PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO THINK

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:34.880
ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW

02:02:34.947 --> 02:02:36.916
THAT THAT ELEMENT TO THE BILL

02:02:36.982 --> 02:02:39.585
DOESN'T. MEAN THAT AFFORDABLE

02:02:39.652 --> 02:02:42.088
DEVELOPMENTS WON'T HAVE PARKING

02:02:42.154 --> 02:02:43.489

HAVE IT BE CREATED BY. BY US

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:01.474
COUNCIL SUPER TO FOR EXAMPLE OF

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:05.177
A DEVELOPER IS DOING A PROJECT

FOR FAMILY HOMELESS VETERANS

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:09.749
WHO MADE IT AND THEY HAPPEN TO

02:03:09.815 --> 02:03:13.519
KNOW. THAT THEIR POPULATION.

02:03:13.586 --> 02:03:16.989
UNLIKE CARS THE NATION IS PARTY

02:03:17.056 --> 02:03:19.525
AT THE NECESSARY .COM THEIR-

02:03:19.592 --> 02:03:24.363
NEXT OPPOSED POINT TO A. A SET

02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:27.299
OF RULES THIS WHICH MIGHT HELP

02:03:27.366 --> 02:03:30.102
EARLIER AND JUST SHARE TO WHAT

02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:31.904
IS THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE ANY

02:03:31.971 --> 02:03:34.840
CHANGES TO PARKING. MINIMUMS

02:03:34.907 --> 02:03:36.342
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS

02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:38.244

TRANSIT I DIDN'T SEE BONUS LAW

02:03:40.846 --> 02:03:43.182
CURRENTLY ALREADY DOES THIS

02:03:43.249 --> 02:03:45.050
JUST THIS JUST MAKES A LITTLE

02:03:45.117 --> 02:03:46.252
MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR

02:03:46.318 --> 02:03:54.093
DEVELOPERS USING. BY ME TO ON

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:55.928

TO. OR WHATEVER TO HAVE MORE.

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.002
AND WHAT IT DOES IS PREVENT A

02:04:03.068 --> 02:04:04.103
CUTTER. APPROACH BECAUSE WE

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:08.340

IN YOUR SHOES AND- I APPRECIATE.

02:54:58.487 --> 02:54:59.188
THE DIFFICULTY IN THE

02:54:59.255 --> 02:55:01.524
COMPLEXITY- MAKING PUBLIC

02:55:01.591 --> 02:55:05.228
POLICY IN THIS ARENA AMONG SO

02:55:05.294 --> 02:55:07.463
MANY JURISDICTIONS AND LEVELS

02:55:07.530 --> 02:55:09.265
OF GOVERNMENT AND HOW DO WE

02:55:09.332 --> 02:55:11.267
MAKE PROGRESS ON WHAT SOMETIMES

02:55:11.334 --> 02:55:13.903
SEEMS LIKE. A MOST INTRACTABLE

02:55:13.970 --> 02:55:17.106
ISSUE. AND I THINK THAT MAYBE

02:55:17.173 --> 02:55:20.743
THE LUXURY BEING OUT- AND

02:55:20.810 --> 02:55:23.479
CHAIRING THE GOVERNOR'S TASK

02:55:23.546 --> 02:55:25.214
FORCE HERE TO TAKE A STEP BACK

02:55:25.281 --> 02:55:28.551
AS DID MY COLLEAGUES WHO SERVED

02:55:28.618 --> 02:55:30.753
WITH ME. TO ASK A FUNDAMENTAL

02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:33.890
QUESTION. THIS BILL SEEKS TO

02:55:33.956 --> 02:55:36.459
ADDRESS WHY IS IT THAT

02:55:36.525 --> 02:55:39.495
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN THE

02:55:39.562 --> 02:55:42.565
AREA OF HOMELESSNESS. THE MOST

02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:44.367
CERTAINLY PRIOR TO THE

02:55:44.433 --> 02:55:46.969
CORONAVIRUS THE MOST SERIOUS

02:55:47.036 --> 02:55:51.307
HEALTH. PUBLIC HEALTH AND

02:55:51.374 --> 02:55:53.442
PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES FACING

02:55:53.509 --> 02:55:56.612
OUR STATE WHY IS EVERYTHING WE

02:55:56.679 --> 02:56:00.750
DO. VOLUNTARY AND OPTIONAL WHY

02:56:00.816 --> 02:56:02.585
IS THERE NOTHING IN THE LAW

02:56:02.652 --> 02:56:05.154
THAT SAYS THAT ALL OF US WHO

02:56:05.221 --> 02:56:07.957
ARE RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE

02:56:08.024 --> 02:56:09.959
FOR MAKING THIS PROBLEM BETTER

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:12.561
AND SAVING THE LIVES WHY AREN'T

02:56:12.628 --> 02:56:15.431
WE REQUIRED COLLECTIVELY TO

02:56:15.498 --> 02:56:17.366
MOVE TOWARDS GETTING MORE

02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:21.570
PEOPLE OFF THE STREET INTO INTO

02:56:21.637 --> 02:56:25.708
HOUSING ALTERNATELY. A ROOF- AT

02:56:25.775 --> 02:56:28.945
FIRST AND WHATEVER SERVICES

02:56:29.011 --> 02:56:32.448
THAT PEOPLE NEED TO. I AM VERY

02:56:32.515 --> 02:56:36.385
LIVES. THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO

02:56:36.452 --> 02:56:38.788
USE PUBLIC POLICY TO ADDRESS

02:56:38.854 --> 02:56:41.257
THAT QUESTION AND I BELIEVE IT

02:56:41.324 --> 02:56:44.293
DOES SO IN A VERY INTELLIGENT

02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:47.296
WAY. IT SAYS THAT OVER AND

02:56:47.363 --> 02:56:48.864
AGGRESSIVE BUT REASONABLE

02:56:48.931 --> 02:56:51.667
PERIOD OF TIME THAT ALL OF US

02:56:51.734 --> 02:56:54.370
EVERY CITY EVERY COUNTY IN THE

02:56:54.437 --> 02:56:56.973
STATE OF CALIFORNIA MUST BE

02:56:57.039 --> 02:57:00.009
MUST MOVE TOWARDS- ACHIEVABLE

02:57:00.076 --> 02:57:01.544
BENCHMARKS IN REDUCING THE

02:57:01.610 --> 02:57:03.346
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:57:03.412 --> 02:57:08.084
UNSHELTERED. AND IT IS. A AS

02:57:08.150 --> 02:57:10.853
THE CHAIRMAN SAID THE CHAIRMAN

02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:11.354
OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING

02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:15.324
COMMITTEE SAID. MR TO. APPOINT

02:57:15.391 --> 02:57:18.694
AN INSPECTOR GENERAL TO ENSURE

02:57:18.761 --> 02:57:22.198
THAT ALL JURISDICTIONS ARE

02:57:22.264 --> 02:57:25.334
ACTING IN GOOD FAITH TOWARDS

02:57:25.401 --> 02:57:28.938
MEETING THE BENCHMARKS. THIS IS

02:57:29.005 --> 02:57:31.040
ESSENTIAL AT LEAST SOME FORM OF

02:57:31.107 --> 02:57:33.476
THIS IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE NO

02:57:33.542 --> 02:57:36.612
AMOUNT OF MONEY. HE'S GOING TO

02:57:36.679 --> 02:57:39.048
CHANGE SOME OF THE DYSFUNCTIONS

02:57:39.115 --> 02:57:41.851
FRANKLY THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR

02:57:41.917 --> 02:57:43.285
HOMELESS SERVICES AND HOUSING

02:57:43.352 --> 02:57:46.522
SYSTEMS. THE MULTIPLICITY OF

02:57:46.589 --> 02:57:47.890
JURISDICTIONS THE FACT THAT

02:57:47.957 --> 02:57:49.525
MONEY IS NOT. THERE'S NO

02:57:49.592 --> 02:57:51.227
INCENTIVE TO CONSOLIDATE

02:57:51.293 --> 02:57:57.466
RESOURCES ACROSS. TO MEET CASH

02:57:57.533 --> 02:58:00.069
PARKS THE FACT THAT SOME

02:58:00.136 --> 02:58:01.737
JURISDICTIONS DON'T WANT TO DO

02:58:01.804 --> 02:58:03.939
THIS WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:58:04.006 --> 02:58:06.776
WANT TO HOMELESS SHELTERS OR

02:58:06.842 --> 02:58:09.345
HOMELESS RELATED HOUSING IN

02:58:09.412 --> 02:58:11.580
THEIR JURISDICTIONS THE FACT

02:58:11.647 --> 02:58:14.016
THAT COLLECTIVELY WILL NOT

02:58:14.083 --> 02:58:16.085
DRIVEN TOWARDS A GOAL. IT WE

02:58:16.152 --> 02:58:18.054
MUST BE DRIVEN TOWARDS GOAL.

02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:20.689
AND SO I WOULD URGE THE

02:58:20.756 --> 02:58:23.626
COMMITTEE TO PASS THIS BILL.

02:58:23.692 --> 02:58:25.261
AND KNOWING THAT WERE LIVING IN

02:58:25.327 --> 02:58:26.896
THE MIDST OF A VERY DIFFICULT

02:58:26.962 --> 02:58:31.400
TIME CANNOT FORSAKE.

02:58:31.467 --> 02:58:33.669
ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND

02:58:33.736 --> 02:58:35.871
HOMELESSNESS IN LEGISLATIVE

02:58:35.938 --> 02:58:38.340
YEAR TWENTY TWENTY JUST BECAUSE

02:58:38.407 --> 02:58:41.610
WE'RE LIVING IN A TOUGH TIME

02:58:41.677 --> 02:58:43.446
THE BENCHMARKS THAT. ASSEMBLY

02:58:43.512 --> 02:58:45.281
MEMBER CHIU HAS IDENTIFIED ARE

02:58:45.347 --> 02:58:47.917
REASONABLE THE PROCESS TO

02:58:47.983 --> 02:58:49.652
DEVELOP BENCHMARKS I SHOULD SAY

02:58:49.718 --> 02:58:51.187
ARE VERY REASONABLE THEIR

02:58:51.253 --> 02:58:52.988
COLLABORATIVE. AND I KNOW SOME

02:58:53.055 --> 02:58:54.457
OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:58:54.523 --> 02:58:56.325
ORGANIZATIONS ARE OPPOSED OR AT

02:58:56.392 --> 02:58:59.862
LEAST. OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED I

02:58:59.929 --> 02:59:02.298
WOULD JUST REMIND EVERYONE THAT

02:59:02.364 --> 02:59:04.733
AMONG I BELIEVE THE SIX

02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:07.336

NUMBER NINETY SUPERVISORS AND

CITY. AND MAYORS. AND SO THIS

02:59:12.942 --> 02:59:14.710
ISN'T A MANDATE ON LOCAL

THAT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

03:11:46.761 --> 03:11:49.631
AFTER BECOMING THE PROVIDER IN

03:11:49.698 --> 03:11:51.299
TWO THOUSAND SIX- THE COUNTY

03:11:51.366 --> 03:11:54.469
WAS REAL ACTIVE IN PURSUING.

03:11:54.536 --> 03:11:55.804
WHAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

03:11:55.871 --> 03:11:56.972
WANTED TO DO AND THAT WAS A

03:11:57.038 --> 03:11:58.473
COMMISSIONED IN HOMELESSNESS

03:11:58.540 --> 03:11:59.507
AND SO I WAS THE INITIAL

03:11:59.574 --> 03:12:01.209
CHAIRED SERVED IN THAT POSITION

03:12:01.276 --> 03:12:06.181
FROM MY- ENTIRE TWO TERMS AND I

GOVERNOR I REALIZE. THAT IS

03:12:11.219 --> 03:12:14.556
WELL AND STEINBERG IS WELL. SO

PRESENTED TO ACTUALLY INSURE

BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS

03:14:41.069 --> 03:14:42.203
NOT. BASED ON WHAT I'M READING

03:14:42.270 --> 03:14:43.938
THAT IT DOES NOT EVEN GO ON

03:14:44.005 --> 03:14:46.107
THROUGH THE COURTS IT'S REMAINS

03:14:46.174 --> 03:14:48.943

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IT WAS

03:15:03.691 --> 03:15:05.760
INTERESTING TO NOTE. THAT

PROJECT HOME KEY WITH THE

03:15:22.477 --> 03:15:24.412
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE GOING

03:15:24.479 --> 03:15:26.781

THE CAN GOVERNMENTS THE STATE

03:15:38.726 --> 03:15:40.595
SO THIS SEEMS TO BE REALLY A

03:15:40.662 --> 03:15:43.998
HEAVY HANDED BEFORE WE'VE- THAT

03:15:44.065 --> 03:15:46.267
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE-

03:15:46.334 --> 03:15:48.603
THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. DON'T

03:15:48.670 --> 03:15:51.206
COMPLY IN THE SHORT TERM WHEN

LEASED. OR FINANCED YET ONLY

03:16:09.190 --> 03:16:10.992
60% OF THOSE WERE ACTUALLY

03:16:11.059 --> 03:16:14.262
OCCUPIED THAT SUGGESTS THAT.

03:16:14.329 --> 03:16:16.498
THE TRANSIENT NATURE OF

03:16:16.564 --> 03:16:18.933

PARTNERSHIPS OF THE STATE AND

03:16:40.088 --> 03:16:40.788
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SOLVE THE

03:16:40.855 --> 03:16:42.790

04:47:06.609 --> 04:47:08.344
PLANNING ORGANISER THERE BUT

04:47:08.411 --> 04:47:10.880
THERE'S A PHILOSOPHY THAT THAT

04:47:10.947 --> 04:47:13.282
UNLESS WE EXEMPT EXEMPT THINGS

04:47:13.349 --> 04:47:14.884
THAT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THE

04:47:14.951 --> 04:47:16.852
PROJECTS COULD BE DONE I THINK

04:47:16.919 --> 04:47:21.257
THE BILL AND THE AUTHORED.

04:47:21.324 --> 04:47:21.824
THAT'S WHEN HE MAKES A GOOD

04:47:21.891 --> 04:47:23.859
POINT THAT THAT THIS WAS.

04:47:23.926 --> 04:47:25.595
HOWEVER WE WANT TO CHARACTERIZE

04:47:25.661 --> 04:47:28.631
IT IS SAID. SB THIRTY FIVE DID

04:47:28.698 --> 04:47:30.933
NOT EMBRACE THE TRIBAL CULTURAL

04:47:31.000 --> 04:47:33.803
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AND THAT

04:47:33.869 --> 04:47:36.172

04:47:38.874 --> 04:47:40.743
EVERYBODY'S EFFORTS TO WORK ON

04:47:40.810 --> 04:47:42.178
THE BILL TO TRY TO GET SOME

04:47:42.244 --> 04:47:45.181

04:47:45.247 --> 04:47:47.950
WITHOUT SEQUEL WE HAVE NO

04:47:48.017 --> 04:47:52.321
POSSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC TO

04:47:52.388 --> 04:47:55.224
COMMUNICATE YOU KNOW THERE ARE

04:47:55.291 --> 04:47:57.860
SOME NON. VISIT COAL SOURCES IN.

04:47:57.927 --> 04:48:01.263
D. IDEA IN THE D. THE IDEA

04:48:01.330 --> 04:48:03.599
WE'VE EXEMPTS. THIS PROJECTS

04:48:03.666 --> 04:48:08.237
FROM THE ROBUST DISCUSSION OF

04:48:08.304 --> 04:48:10.439
THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY ACT IN

04:48:10.506 --> 04:48:14.710
CALIFORNIA IT SOMEHOW CREATES

04:48:14.777 --> 04:48:17.079
AN ENTITLEMENT THAT THEY HAVE

04:48:17.146 --> 04:48:18.047
THAT THAT THAT THE PEOPLE THE

04:48:18.114 --> 04:48:20.016
DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO DO IT

04:48:20.082 --> 04:48:21.484
AND THAT SOMEHOW WE CORRECT

04:48:21.550 --> 04:48:23.786
THAT MOVIE WE CORRECT BILLS ALL

04:48:23.853 --> 04:48:25.955
THE TIME WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE

04:48:26.022 --> 04:48:27.823
MADE A MISTAKE AND I'M

04:48:27.890 --> 04:48:29.959

04:48:34.497 --> 04:48:35.831
LANDSCAPE TO THE EXTENT THAT

04:48:35.898 --> 04:48:39.635
IT'S GEOGRAPHICALLY DEFINED IS

04:48:39.702 --> 04:48:40.436
GOING TO BE BUT WE'VE DONE

04:48:40.503 --> 04:48:46.208

FOR ALTHOUGH I. VOTED FOR SB

04:48:48.544 --> 04:48:49.311
THIRTY FIVE FIVE BUT I THINK

04:48:49.378 --> 04:48:51.113
THAT PUBLIC PROCESS AND THAT.

04:48:51.180 --> 04:48:54.650

PURCHASING LAND TO DEVELOP IS

04:49:53.142 --> 04:49:54.510
NOT STEPPING INTO A SITUATION

04:49:54.577 --> 04:49:57.413
THAT. EVEN GETS US TO THE POINT

04:49:57.480 --> 04:49:58.881
THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULLY

04:49:58.948 --> 04:50:00.349
DISCLOSED AT THE TIME OF

04:50:00.416 --> 04:50:02.017

04:50:02.084 --> 04:50:05.454
WONDERING IF THAT IS THE CASE I

HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LOOK UP

04:50:06.088 --> 04:50:08.324
HISTORICAL LANDMARKS IN. STATE

04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:10.126
SENATE A REASONABLY GOOD JOB OF

04:50:10.192 --> 04:50:12.161
DEDICATING A LOT OF SITES IS

04:50:12.228 --> 04:50:15.498
STATE HISTORICAL LANDMARKS FOR

04:50:15.564 --> 04:50:17.433
A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS. I

04:50:17.500 --> 04:50:19.335
WOULD GO. TRAILER WE'VE GOT

04:50:19.401 --> 04:50:21.904
BILL GRINDING SITES SOCIAL

04:50:21.971 --> 04:50:24.173
MOUNTAINS BURIAL GROUNDS SACRED

04:50:24.240 --> 04:50:26.709
SITES BUT- HOPEFULLY. WE HAVE A

04:50:26.776 --> 04:50:30.513
GOOD INVENTORY SO THAT SOMEONE

04:50:30.579 --> 04:50:31.447
DOESN'T EVEN FIND THEMSELVES.

04:50:31.514 --> 04:50:33.249
VISITATION YES I'LL TURN OVER

04:50:33.315 --> 04:50:35.251
THE ALL TOURNAMENT BUT I WAS

04:50:35.317 --> 04:50:36.418
UPSET BECAUSE WE NOW HAD MANY

04:50:36.485 --> 04:50:38.487
DISCUSSIONS WITH US AND ABOUT

04:50:38.554 --> 04:50:40.656
THIS AND SO IMPORTANT- THERE

04:50:40.723 --> 04:50:42.124
ARE SEVERAL CATEGORIES THERE

04:50:42.191 --> 04:50:44.360
ARE REGISTRIES. OF TRIBAL

04:50:44.426 --> 04:50:45.995
CULTURAL RESOURCES FEDERAL

04:50:46.061 --> 04:50:49.965
STATE OR TRIBAL REGISTRIES- AND

04:50:50.032 --> 04:50:51.300
THESE ARE LISTS THOSE ARE ALL

04:50:51.367 --> 04:50:53.936
CATEGORICALLY EXEMPT FROM SB

04:50:54.003 --> 04:50:55.905
THIRTY FIVE UNDER SB ONE SIXTY

04:50:55.971 --> 04:50:57.273
EIGHT. AND I DON'T THINK WE

04:50:57.339 --> 04:50:59.775
HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT FIVE

04:50:59.842 --> 04:51:01.076
ON A REGISTER. OF THINGS

04:51:01.143 --> 04:51:04.046
CHECKED OF VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD

04:51:04.113 --> 04:51:04.980
HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY TRIBAL

04:51:05.047 --> 04:51:08.651
CULTURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT

04:51:08.717 --> 04:51:10.619
LISTED ON A REGISTRY AND THERE

04:51:10.686 --> 04:51:15.891
ARE MANY. VERY VERY WHEN. WHY

04:51:15.958 --> 04:51:20.296
NOT LISTED. ONE OF THOSE

04:51:20.362 --> 04:51:22.097
REASONS. SIRWHAT DOES THE

04:51:22.164 --> 04:51:23.999
CURRENT. AND IF YOU HAVE IT IS

04:51:24.066 --> 04:51:26.635
ON A RED JUST. EVEN IF IT'S

04:51:26.702 --> 04:51:27.636
THEIR PUBLIC COURTS SUPPOSED TO

04:51:27.703 --> 04:51:28.904
POKE A PAUL. AND WE KNOW THAT

04:51:28.971 --> 04:51:29.638
PEOPLE EITHER INTENSELY OR

04:51:29.705 --> 04:51:31.841
UNINTENTIONALLY ANNOYS PEOPLE

04:51:31.907 --> 04:51:36.111
JUST WANT TO SEE SOMETHING AND

04:51:36.178 --> 04:51:37.213
END UP DAMAGING AT. OR THE-

04:51:37.279 --> 04:51:43.118
BECAUSE- YOUR. ON THE STRINGS.

04:51:43.185 --> 04:51:43.686
AND SO IS THEY'RE ARE SOME

04:51:43.752 --> 04:51:44.687
POWER REASONS WHY THEY ARE ALL

04:51:44.753 --> 04:51:46.856
LISTED AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

04:51:46.922 --> 04:51:48.224
ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING

04:51:48.290 --> 04:51:49.658

IMPORTANT BILL. I'M FRANKLY

05:01:30.906 --> 05:01:33.408
THAT'S WHY. WE'VE TAKEN AS MUCH

05:01:33.475 --> 05:01:34.409
TIME AS A TAKEN OVER THE LAST

05:01:34.476 --> 05:01:36.445

05:01:59.501 --> 05:02:03.171
NEED TO GET IT RIGHT. AB ONE

05:02:03.238 --> 05:02:04.339
SIXTY EIGHT IS A LANDMARK BILL.

05:02:04.406 --> 05:02:06.475
BECAUSE SB THIRTY FIVE IS NOT

05:02:06.541 --> 05:02:08.243

05:02:54.789 --> 05:02:57.459
TOPPING BECAUSE OF SB THIRTY

RESOURCES THERE'S MORE WORK TO

05:03:35.664 --> 05:03:37.132
DO NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT WE

05:03:37.198 --> 05:03:39.034
KNOW THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR

05:03:43.705 --> 05:03:44.873
THAT DIRECTION. IN ADDITION

05:03:44.940 --> 05:03:47.976
CALIFORNIA FACES A DRAMATIC AND

05:03:48.043 --> 05:03:50.378

05:04:19.474 --> 05:04:21.076
SEEING CERTAIN COMMUNITIES

05:04:21.142 --> 05:04:23.411

05:04:29.084 --> 05:04:30.151
THAT THEY HAVE TO SPEND FOUR

CALIFORNIA HAS 13% OF THE
