THEIR TOTAL OF FOURTEEN BILLS ON TODAY'S AGENDA. WE HAVE FIVE ITEMS ON CONSENT THOSE BILLS INCLUDE ITEM NUMBER SIX AB FIVE FORTY SIX ITEM NUMBER NINE YES. AB SEVEN FIFTY NINE ITEM NUMBER -- ELEVEN AB ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR ITEM NUMBER TWELVE A. B. TWELVE SIXTY FIVE AN ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN AB -- EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT TODAY. DON'T NEED TO SEE THAT NOW SO -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON AB. SEVEN FIFTY FOUR COME ON DOWN. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. GOOD MORNING. AB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR WILL ENABLE EIGHT ONE ONE CENTERS TO FULFILL THEIR STATUTORY MANDATE -- MANDATE TO DUTY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE BY NOTIFYING UNDERGROUND FACILITY OWNERS ABOUT NEARBY EXCAVATION. WHEN AN EXCAVATOR CALLS AN EIGHT ONE ONE CENTER THE CENTER IS -- THE CENTER IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE DETAILS BUT BE DIGGING PRO -- PROJECT TO THE FACILITY OWNERS THAT HAVE UNDERGROUND LINES IN THE VICINITY. THE FACILITY OWNERS WILL THEN SEND A FIELD TECHNICIAN TO LOCATE AND MARKETS UNDERGROUND LINES AT THE DIG SITE USING COLORED PAINT. OR FLAGS TO SHOW THE LINE LOCATIONS THE EXCAVATORS CAM THEN YOU SAFE DIGGING PRACTICES TO AVOID DAMAGING THE LINES. UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SERVICES IS NOT REQUIRED TO SHARE GIS MAP DATA WITH THE A ONE EIGHT ONE ONE NOTIFICATION CENTERS. COUNTY AND STATE G. I. S. DEPARTMENTS CREATE THE MOST CURRENT ACTOR AND THE SORT OF SORTIED OF GIS MAP DATA INCLUDING ADDRESSES ROADS PROPERTY BOUNDARIES AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY AT CETERA. SO BY REQUIRING A ONE ONE CENTERS RECEIVE THE MOST CURRENT GIS MAP DATA MAPPING DATA. AB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR WILL BENEFIT ALL STAKEHOLDERS BY PREVENTING DAMAGE TO UNDERGROUND LINES I WILL HAVE MY WITNESS -- SELF INTRODUCE. PLEASE HELLO I'M JAMES WINGATE FROM USA NORTH -- EIGHT ONE ONE WILL WHERE THE CALL BUT I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. AND WE ARE THE CENTER TO CALL BEFORE YOU DIG OR KIND OF LIKE DISPATCH FOR THE UTILITY COMPANIES IT'S KIND OF LIKE HOW. NINE ONE ONE DETERMINES WHO HAS JURISDICTION FOR POLICE FIRE AND MEDICAL IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY OF CERTAIN LOCATION WE DO THE SAME THING FOR UTILITY OWNERS WHETHER FIFTEEN HUNDRED UTILITY OWNERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER -- TO TO BE ABLE TO SERVE AND AND HAVE THEM ARRIVE AT THE DIG SITE LOCATIONS. TO MARK THE UNDERGROUND FACILITIES TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING DAMAGED. HOWEVER A LOT OF NEW CONSTRUCTION OCCURS -- AND DIGGING HAPPENS IN THESE LOCATIONS SUCH AS A NEW RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION THAT'S BEING BUILT. AND SOLD SOMETIMES THOSE DON'T APPEAR ON THE MAPS YET IF YOU RELY ON A COMMERCIAL MAP PROVIDER LIKE GOOGLE OR APPLE MAPS OR GARMENT OR ENTITIES LIKE THAT SO WHAT WE NEED IS THE DATA FROM THE COUNTIES WHERE THEY HAVE IT. AS SOON AS IT'S BEEN APPROVED AND SO WE WANT THE STATE TO SHARE THAT WITH US AND WE WILL PAY OUR SHARE OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. BUT SO THAT WE CAN BE CONSIDERED. A SIMILAR TO A STATE AGENCY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS -- MOST CURRENT DATA TO USE IT AS EFFECTIVELY AS NINE ONE ONE DOES. OTHER WITNESSES THE SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER -- TODD BLOOM SIGN FOR DICK ALERTS THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CALL CENTER -- IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE DEALER THE LAST -- FISCAL YEAR -- RECEIVED ONE MILLION REQUESTS FOR THE SERVICE A PRODUCING NEARLY FIVE MILLION REQUESTS TO A UTILITY COMPANIES TO MARK UNDERGROUND LINES OF THE SERVICE PHOTOS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VOLUME WE ESCRIBO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESS IS SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WOULDN'T THEY COULD BE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. ASSEMBLY. US WITH THAT WILL. TURN -- TO THE COMMITTEE. I I GUESS I HAVE A YOUR QUESTION -- IN IN IN NOT TO BE CONTINUALLY OUT OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL COMMITTEE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT P. JEANNIE. BUT SHE DOES COME TO MY ATTENTION AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT KIND OF SET ME OFF -- YEAH SO EIGHT AGAINST THEM. THEY'VE HAD LIKE FIVE YEARS. OF FALSIFYING REPORTS ON THESE TYPE OF THING SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT KIND OF FILL pTHAT WAS AND IF THERE'S A WAY WITHIN -- THIS. THIS PROCESS TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THOSE TYPE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN. AN EXCELLENT QUESTION SO RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES THE NOTIFICATION CENTERS US FROM NORTH AND AND THE OTHER CALL CENTER IN THE SOUTH TO NOTIFY THE UTILITY OWNERS. AND THEN THE LAW REQUIRES EACH UTILITY OWNER TO GO LOCATED MARK THEIR LINES IN THE FIELD. THERE IS NO. UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE FACILITY OPERATORS REPORT BACK WHAT TYPE OF ACTION THEY DID MEANING IF THEY MARK THE LINES OR IF THEY SAID WE GOT OUT THERE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT OUR LINE IS OVER HERE IN THE DIGGING IS HAPPENING OVER HERE. HOWEVER THERE IS ANOTHER BILL -- THAT I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THAT WOULD REQUIRE -- THE FACILITY OPERATORS TO REPORT BACK THE STATUS OF WOMEN A A MARKED IT AND THEN THE EIGHT ONE ONE CALL CENTERS WILL KEEP TRACK OF IT -- IN OUR DATABASE SO THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THIRD -- NEUTRAL RECORDS OF WHEN THE UTILITY OWNERS MARK THIS WHETHER THEY DID ON TIME OR NOT. SO IF THAT BILL PASSES WHICH I'M IN SUPPORT OF PERSONALLY -- THEN THAT WOULD. MAKE A MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THAT WERE AS WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO NOW WITH P. GINNY FALSIFYING TAT WAS JUST THEIR OWN INTERNAL RECORDS -- BUT THE THEY ALSO WERE UNDER SOME FEDERAL REGULATION BECAUSE THEY ARE -- OPERATE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE SO THEY WERE AUDITED BY A FEDERAL AGENCY CALLED FILMS OF THAT REGULATES PIPELINES AND SELL THOSE RECORDS WERE FALSIFIED FOR THEM IS MY UNDERSTANDING I DON'T HAVE EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF THAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COME TO OUR OFFICE LIKE I SAID. SO. AS OF TODAY NO MECHANISM IN PLACE TO TRACK THAT BUT IF THAT OTHER BILL PASSES. THE END THAT MECHANISM WOULD BECOME ACTIVE. WHATEVER THAT THAT LAW TAKES EFFECT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TODD BLOOM SIGNING IN PARTICULAR TO THAT BILLS AB ELEVEN SIXTY SIX BY MR LEVINE. AND IT IS IT HAS BEEN REFERRED YOUR COMMITTEE ON THAT BILL SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE SCENARIOS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A BY PROVIDING ELECTRONIC POSITIVE RESPONSE.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS [inaudible] PLUS YOU. AB FOR TWENTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION TO CREATE AN INVENTORY OF POTENTIALLY SEISMICALLY VULNERABLE BUILDINGS LOCATED IN THE TWENTY NINE COUNTIES. OF MOST SEISMIC RISK CALIFORNIA HAS THOUSANDS OF BUILDINGS THAT ARE KNOWN TO PRESENT A HEIGHTENED EARTHQUAKE RISK OF DEATH INJURY AND DAMAGE. BASED ON THEIR AGE STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS SIZE AND LOCATION. THE CHRONIC LABOR AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGES MOST CALIFORNIA CITIES ALREADY SUFFER WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE FOR YEARS TO COME FOLLOWING A LARGE EARTHQUAKE. THE MOST RECENT CALIFORNIA SHAKEOUT STUDY ESTIMATES THAT A MAJOR QUAKE ALONG THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT. COULD CAUSE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC DAMAGE. AND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OR MORE DEATHS. IN MAY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ARIZONA RAND DISASTER DRILLS IN ANTICIPATION OF RECEIVING. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS. THE THE STATED IT AS REFUGEES FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT SEISMIC ACTIVITY ON THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT. WHILE SOME CITIES MOST NOTABLY LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO HAVE IDENTIFIED VULNERABLE BUILDINGS AND IMPLEMENTED MANDATORY RETROFITS. LARGE PARTS OF THIS THE HAVE NOTS. BEFORE WE CAN SUPPORT LOCAL MITIGATION EFFORTS THROUGH GRANT PROGRAMS WE MUST GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXTENT. OF OUR VULNERABILITIES AND ACCURATE IN THE INVENTORY. IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP IN DEVELOPING LONGER TERM TARGETED SOLUTIONS IN ADVANCE OF MAJOR EARTHQUAKE I WILL CONTINUE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION TO ENSURE A BEAT. FOR TWENTY NINE IS A COST EFFECTIVE SURVEY OF SEISMICALLY VULNERABLE BUILDINGS AND CALIFORNIA'S MOST EARTHQUAKE PRONE AREAS -- I'M JOINED TODAY BY STARS SAY IT -- WITH THE PUBLIC POLICY CHAIR OF FOR THE EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE. AS WELL AS KATIE ALMONT WITH -- CALVO. ON BEHALF OF KALPOE THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT IS TO SUPPORT [inaudible] YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS OUR ESSAY ED AND I AM THE PUBLIC POLICY CHAIR FOR THE EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE OR E. R. I.. WE ARE A NATIONAL TECHNICAL SOCIETY OF EXPERTS INCLUDING ENGINEERS ARCHITECTS. PUBLIC POLICY AND SOCIAL SCIENCE EXPERTS DEDICATED TO REDUCING EARTHQUAKE RISK BASED IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FOUR TWO NINE WHICH CALLS FOR A STATE WIDE INVENTORY OF BUILDINGS. KNOWN TO BE SUBJECT TO DAMAGE OR COLLAPSE AND EARTHQUAKES. THIS BILL REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP AND TOWARD QUANTIFYING THE EXTENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE OF VULNERABLE BUILDINGS. HERE I BELIEVES IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS IS JUST A FIRST STEP TOWARD FUTURE LEGISLATION THAT FOCUSES PRIORITIES AND SUPPORTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN IDENTIFYING AND RETROFITTING THESE BUILDINGS. SOME OF WHICH ARE ALREADY DOING THIS CRITICAL WORK. WE ARE ALSO VERY PLEASE THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION SETS BUT THE SEVEN FIFTY COMMISSION AND WE HAVE CONFIDENCE. IN THEIR EXPERTISE IS THE TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE SUCH AN INVENTORY. TO BE CONDUCTED AT THE CITY LEVEL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARRYING A MEDICATION PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE RESTS AND TO IDENTIFY THE USE OF STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES OF THESE BUILDINGS. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST LIKELY ACTIVE REGION IN THE KIND COUNTRY OUTSIDE OF ALASKAN. WITH A 99% CHANCE OF ONE OR MORE MAGNITUDE SIX POINT SEVEN OR GREATER EARTHQUAKES BEFORE. TWENTY FORTY TWO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN IMPERATIVE BUILDS IS TAKE A FIRST STEP TOWARD -- REDUCING THE RISK OF OUR BUILDINGS AND WE ARE VERY. THANKFUL FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER NAZARIAN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON SEISMIC SAFETY AND CHAMPIONING THIS BILL IN OTHER BILLS. AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ITS WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR NUMBERS MEAN ISCHEMIC KATIE ALMOND AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ECHO OUR COALITION PARTNERS THOUGHTS ON THIS BILL AND THAT IT IS A CRUCIAL FIRST STEP IN LOOKING AT SEISMIC SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH CALVO AND THE COALITION PARTNERS TO INTEGRATE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT APPROACH FOR THIS PROGRAM COUPLE DID OPPOSE THE SIMILAR BILL THAT AND IS THERE IN PROPOSAL ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN PROPOSED LAST YEAR. AS IT WAS A STATEWIDE MANDATE AND AT IDENTIFIED LOCAL FUNDS AS A POSSIBLE SOURCE FOR THE PROGRAM HOWEVER NOW WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN HIS OFFICE WE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT. AB FOR TWENTY NINE THIS YEAR'S BILL WILL FOCUS ON THE MOST TWENTY NINE VULNERABLE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES FEDERAL GRANTS AND THE GENERAL FUND AS POSSIBLE SOURCES FOR FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. AND IT DIRECTS THE EISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION TO HIRE A THIRD PARTY TO CONDUCT THE INVENTORY -- WITH THESE THOUGHTS COUPLE LET'S IT SUPPORTS AND AGAIN THANKS THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US. I'M JUST THINKING IF CAO BOW IS EVEN FORGOT IT'S BEEN HERE FIVE YEARS CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS BUT WHAT IS IT YES SO WE ARE THE BUILDING OFFICIALS FOR ALL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COUNTIES AND CITIES WE REPRESENT ABOUT 95%. OF THE COUNTIES AND CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE -- BASICALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. PERFECT THIS WITNESS THANK YOU BURKE [inaudible] CLOSE. OR IF YOUR AWARENESS IN OPPOSITION OKAY AB. WITNESSES SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DAVID JOHNSON ABOUT THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA IN SUPPORT. THE KIDDOS HERE ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES CITY MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI IN YOU COULD YOU REPEAT THAT THE MIKE DIDN'T GET ON THE PERSONAL KIDDOS HERE ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES CITY MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI. AND CITY OF SANTA MONICA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT WITNESSES OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IS DAVID BONTA WITH SOME STRUCTURAL ENGINEER IN SAN FRANCISCO I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE E. R. I AND ACTIVE IN THIS FOR TWENTY YEARS SO SEASON. OF CALIFORNIA A SPEAKING ONLY FOR MYSELF TODAY WITH MY CLIENTS INCLUDE FEMA THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY A BAD HIT THE CITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND BERKELEY HAYWARD. MOUNTAIN VIEW THEY SEEK MY ADVICE ON EXACTLY THIS TOPIC EXISTING BUILDINGS IN EARTHQUAKE RISK REDUCTION POP POLICY ALL OF THIS IS SCARY STATISTICS YOU HEARD FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS IN THIS AREA. ARE LEGIT. THE PROBLEM IS THIS BILL DOES NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION I'M GONNA REGION TAKE NOTES LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BILL. IF YOU THINK THIS BILL WILL STATEWIDE BUILDINGS IT WON'T BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUCH PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA JUST MORE SEISMIC RETROFIT BEING DONE. ACROSS THE STATE THAN EVER BEFORE AND NONE OF IT REQUIRED WHAT THIS BILL IS OFFERING TO PRODUCE THE FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTION OF THIS BILL THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA WERE THAT WE NEED SACRAMENTO TO PROVIDE IT. IS SIMPLY WRONG IF YOU THINK THIS BILL WILL PRODUCE USEFUL DATA IT WILL NOT USEFUL DATE IS NOT JUST ACCOUNT OF BUILDINGS WITH NO CONTEXT WE KNOW THIS FROM PAST STATEWIDE EFFORTS AND FROM MY WORK WITH VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. SEAT WIDE INVENTORIES DO NOT PRODUCE INFORMATION THAT IS USEFUL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHATEVER IS PRODUCED BY THIS BILL WILL HAVE TO BE RE DONE BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN USE IT. IF YOU THINK THIS BILL WILL ACTIVATE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO THAT WORK IT WILL NOT MORE TO IMPLEMENT RECORD FOR PROGRAMS IT WILL NOT ON THE COUNTRY THIS BILL GIVES MOST JURISDICTIONS PERMISSION TO DO NOTHING FOR THREE YEARS. IN FACT WE KNOW THE CAL BONES IN THEIR STATEMENT HAS SAID THE REASON THEY SUPPORT THE BILL IS BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER UNFUNDED MANDATE WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY THINK THE STATE. IS GOING TO DO THEIR WORK FOR THEM THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THAT COULD ACTUALLY STOP. MORE RISK REDUCTION THEN IT STARTS IF YOU THINK THE BILL WILL BE MORE FEASIBLE OR COST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THE WORK IS BEING DONE BY THE STATE INSTEAD OF BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. IT WON'T. ANY EMPHASIS ON UNIFORMITY HERE IS ENTIRELY MISPLACED AS WE CAN PROVE BY LOOKING AT ALL THE SOFT STORY PROGRAMS AND RIGHT NOW IN EFFECT AROUND THE STATE. ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT ALL THE MAKE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF THE BUILDING ALL OF THEM ARE ON EFFECTIVE HOWEVER BECAUSE THEY ARE CUSTOMIZED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. INVENTORY IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN THE WORKS WITH LOCAL RECORDS AND LOCAL EXPERTISE WHICH THIS BILL EXPLICITLY RULES OUT. FINALLY IN SUMMARY IF YOU THINK THIS BILL IS A GOOD WAY TO SPEND A FEW MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE YOU INTERESTED IN EARTHQUAKE SAFETY WORST CHRISTMAS PRODUCTION I HOPE I'VE SHOWN YOU WHY IT'S NOT GOOD INTENTIONS ALONE DO NOT MAKE. GOOD POLICY AGAIN FIRST STEP KALRA FIRST STEP IF YOU WANT IT'S A FIRST STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THE STATE CAN DO. TO HELP INVENTORY EFFORTS AND TO HELP LOWER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT THEY ALL START WITH RECOGNIZING THIS KEY TRUTH. WITH QUICK MITIGATION IN CALIFORNIA IS CONCEIVED PLAN. LEGISLATORS FUNDED AND IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO ANYTHING THAT'S PRODUCED FROM THIS BILL WILL HAVE TO BE RE DONE NO MATTER IF YOU GIVE IT TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MOST DON'T WANT IT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT. I CAN COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THE SUPPORTERS IN THE OTHER IDEAS IF YOU WANT TO SUMMARIZE PLEASE YOU CAN BE. FOR SEISMIC SAFETY. AND SO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. YOU CAN BE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF EFFECTIVE EARTHQUAKE RISK REDUCTION PLANNING AND STILL VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. RIGHT YOU CAN BE OUT TWO MINUTES. IT WAY MORE THAN TWO MINUTES THEIR SUMMERS THAT QUICKLY OKAY I'LL JUST ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THE LEGISLATURE FINALLY SHOWN SOME WILLINGNESS TO SPEND SOME MONEY ON THIS ISSUE PLEASE. LET'S NOT WASTE IT TAKEN THREE YEARS TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT NOT A SINGLE JURISDICTION WE USE I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE COMING TO THE MICROPHONE SO -- CENTER BORDERS. COME BACK TOWARD THANK YOU -- THIS SHERMAN. OR MAKE YOUR NINE OR STAND YOU TO YOUR OPPOSITION TO THIS IS THAT YOU DON'T FIND IT USEFUL BUT CUMBERSOME. AND IT GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION I'M NOT CERTAIN I UNDERSTAND PLACE MAKING TWO MISTAKES IS FOCUSING THE EFFORT AT THE STATE LEVEL WHEN ALL THE REAL WORK IS GOING TO BE DONE AND ALL THE USE OF THE DATA IS PRODUCED BY THIS WILL HAVE TO BE DONE AT THE LOCAL. LEVEL AND A HUGE OPPORTUNITY COST WE'RE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GONNA BE USED WHEN WE COULD. REALLY MAKE THE BILL MUCH BETTER. AND SPENT IN A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE WAY AND THE LOCALS COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS INFORMATION. IT WILL NOT BE USEFUL TO THEM BECAUSE WE KNOW THE KIND OF INFORMATION THEY NEED WHEN THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN LOCAL MEDICATION PROGRAMS AND IT'S NOT WITH THIS BILL COULD POSSIBLY PRODUCE. BASED ON THE DATA THEY HAVE WE HAVE -- ANY COUNTERPOINTS TO THAT -- I AM HAPPY. TO PROVIDE A BRIEF RESPONSE BUT THEN HAVE THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER I GIVE A MUCH MORE IN DEPTH RESPONSE -- FIRST JUST JUST. TO SUMMARIZE IF YOU CAN. WILL THE LOCALS FIND THIS A BENEFIT WILL THIS THE FOLKS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND ON WITHIN THE TWENTY NINE COUNTIES FIND THIS OF BENEFITS. YES. THIS WAS KIND OF A COST CUTTING MEASURE. LAST YEAR'S BILL THAT THE GOVERNOR VETOED WAS GONNA BE IT WAS MORE EXPENSIVE. AND IT REQUIRED MORE FUNDING -- AND IT PUT SOME OF THAT BURDEN ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THIS WAS A WAY OF REDUCING IT TO ONLY THE TWENTY NINE MOST SEISMICALLY ACTIVE. COUNTIES -- THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM HAVING THIS MEASURE IN PLACE AND HAVE AND FOR US TO HAVE IN AN ACCURATE COUNT. OF WHAT THE MOST VULNERABLE. AS FAR IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL NEW ADDRESSING LANDED MANDATE FROM AN EARLIER VERSION SCALED BACK. OKAY THANK YOU. THERE ARE TWO LETTER THANK YOU FOR SHARE I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE INFORMATION IS POWER. IN IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THAT I REPRESENT. IN THE THREE TO WE'VE HAD THE ESPECIALLY IN WITH YOUR WHICH IS. IN MY DISTRICT -- HAVE BEEN INFORMATION WOULD HAV PREPARED US IN I THINK THIS IS WILL OPEN THAT DOOR I SEE THAT. BUT AND I HOPE IT LEAVES THE DOOR TO RETROFITTING OF SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE FOUR THREE TWO THESE ARE THE OLDER BUILDINGS SO -- DO YOU SEE A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES AND CITY MANAGERS AND SO ON TO GRAB THE INFORMATION WORK TOGETHER ON IT WOULD YOU ENVISION FROM THIS. IT'S LIKE GOING TO A DOCTOR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE UNTIL THE DIET DOCTOR DIAGNOSES WHAT YOU HAVE EXACTLY. AND THEN LAYS OUT FOR YOU WHAT THE TREATMENT IS GOING TO BE THIS IS THE SAME THING. IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT BUILDINGS ARE VULNERABLE HOW ARE WE GONNA HAVE AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO RETROFIT OR FIX. AND HOW MUCH OF A COST IT'S GOING TO IMPOSE AND AT THAT POINT FIGURE OUT WITH THE STATE OR GOVERNMENT'S PORTION OF CONTRIBUTION TO HELP LOCAL BUSINESSES OUT WOULD BE. SO INSTEAD OF JUST INTRODUCING BUT I'VE ALSO HAD LEGISLATION ON TAX CREDITS -- SO THAT IT WOULD WE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE TO FUND THE NEEDS THAT ARE GONNA COME FROM THIS INVENTORY LIST. SO IT'S A IT'S BEEN A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH OVER THE YEARS -- BUT WE'VE BEEN REFINING IT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS ALSO TO GET IT TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE THE DATA THAT WE NEED WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON STRENGTHENING BUILDING CODES AND THEN WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR TAX CREDITS. TO ALLOW -- FOR THESE TYPES OF FIXES THAT ARE NECESSARY. LET'S HOPE THIS WILL TAKE YOU OVER THE TOP AND GET THE GOVERNOR SIGNATURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WILK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- QUESTION OF THE OPPOSITION IN A COMMENT. I JUST SO I WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO NAME DROPPING THE YEAR HERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL SO YOU DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU WORK WITH HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL I CAN TELL YOU THAT THREE JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALREADY CALLED ME AND ASKED. ME IF THEY SHOULD STOP THEIR ONGOING PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THIS BILL THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY THEY SEE IT NO I'M NOT SPEAKING ON THEIR BEHALF GOOD I WANTED. I WANT TO JUST MAKE THAT PERFECTLY CLEAR. SO YOU AND I BOTH INDOOR AND THEN THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. AND I WORKED I WAS CHIEF OF STAFF AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT TIME AND THAT. THE FAMOUS APARTMENT BUILDING IN NORTH IN NORTHRIDGE PANCAKED AND PEOPLE DIED SO I WAS IT IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BROADER BILL I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.
